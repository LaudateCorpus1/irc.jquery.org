[00:11:26] <johnywp> i have .css(display:block) then 3 .animate() and lastly I want to turn it back to .css(display:none) after the animations have taken place
[00:11:34] <johnywp> can someone tell me how to do it?
[00:18:02] <jfernandez> why do people put their code in this (function($) {})(jQuery);
[00:19:09] <johnywp> no idea
[00:21:48] <IanWizard-Cloud> I'm having an odd problem.  I've got an attr (I'm using SVG, through the Raphael library, on Chrome), I've got an attr (x) on a non standard element.  I can set the value of x with chrome tools, and it's a simple int, I change it, and it works.  If I try to set either .x on the element, it doesn't do anything, and $(object).attr('x')  returns undeffined
[00:22:12] <IanWizard-Cloud> jfernandez: it's a self-calling anonamous function
[00:22:34] <IanWizard-Cloud> jfernandez: and it passes in jquery.
[00:23:52] <simonleojung> jfernandez: the point is that it basically runs itself and doesn't pollute the global namespace
[00:23:57] <jfernandez> ah
[00:24:21] <IanWizard-Cloud> jfernandez: define the anonamous function (function without a name, there for, needs to be inline):  function($) {...function code ...}
[00:24:43] <IanWizard-Cloud> then call itself, passing in jquery      (jQuery)
[00:28:11] <trollboy> is it cool to ask about jqsuite in here?
[00:31:38] <IanWizard-Cloud> trollboy: well, try it and see.
[01:01:41] <matricks_> hi everybody
[01:01:51] <matricks_> is here somebody using EditArea who can give me some help, please?
[01:02:27] <matricks_> I try to get editor_id, knowing file_id
[01:05:01] <ahandy> can anyone tell me please why this code is only running once? http://jsfiddle.net/hcEaH/
[01:09:24] <matricks_> ahady, when your code is to last item, how will know that first item is your next?
[01:09:51] <ahandy> matricks_: lemme make a quick ternary operation for that
[01:11:40] <ahandy> matricks_: http://jsfiddle.net/hcEaH/1/
[01:11:59] <ahandy> matricks_: http://jsfiddle.net/hcEaH/2/ sorry.
[01:13:39] <matricks_> now, where is your #first?
[01:13:58] <matricks_> put this id to your first item
[01:14:08] <matricks_> then I guess will work?
[01:14:42] <matricks_> <span id="#first" class="active">
[01:14:44] <ahandy> matricks_: the markup im using there isn't the one i have locally, basically the same though. added the id='first' but still doesnt work

[01:16:25] <vaishakh_em> hello
[01:16:59] <vaishakh_em> anybody to help me ???
[01:18:22] <vaishakh_em> hi Torova
[01:19:34] <simonleojung> ahandy: works for me
[01:19:51] <Whirl3d> if you bind keypress to an input element, it only fires when the element is in focus and the keys are pressed, right? It doesn't register every keypress regardless of whether it's focused or not, does it?
[01:19:52] <vaishakh_em> hello simon
[01:19:53] <simonleojung> ahandy: if you want it to keep rotating you need to use setInterval
[01:19:55] <ahandy> simonleojung: works, but doenst display the thirdclass, as you can see
[01:20:09] <simonleojung> because setTimeout is for 1 operation
[01:20:14] <ahandy> simonleojung: oh thanks!
[01:20:24] <simonleojung> ahandy: np :)
[01:20:27] <matricks_> simonleojung: your right
[01:20:35] <vaishakh_em> hi ahandy
[01:23:40] <vaishakh> somebody  please help me .............
[01:23:59] <vaishakh> welcome sunscreen
[01:25:27] <ahandy> simonleojung: can you help me with a quick idea? how would i go about implementing arrows with that function?
[01:25:31] <ahandy> simonleojung: next/previosu arrows
[01:26:03] <vaishakh> hello ahandy ???
[01:26:59] <Whirl3d> anybody know if binding the keypress event to an input element registers keypresses only when the input element is focused or not?
[01:29:24] <simonleojung> Whirl3d: to my knowledge that's what it does, but the documentation does say that the behaviour can vary between browsers
[01:32:11] <Whirl3d> simonleojung, thx for the reply.
[01:35:06] <simonleojung> Whirl3d: np, you can see here that both inputs call separate events on call, simple example tho haha http://jsfiddle.net/simonjung/XQmz2/

[01:48:23] <bufferxyz> hi guys, I have been stuck on a iframe form problem for a while, I wonder if anyone can help me. http://jsfiddle.net/RWsJQ/
[01:49:02] <bufferxyz> this is within the iframe, but the selector doesn't actually select anything inside the iframe
[01:49:14] <bufferxyz> and as a result, it is never closed
[01:49:27] <bufferxyz> *the iframe is never closed
[01:56:58] <bufferxyz> oh nvm, I just need to add it to onClick of the submit button :)
[02:01:00] <devians> hey guys, i have a ui with a media player. i load the next item when theres x seconds left. i want to play the next item when the current media ends (event) or the ajax for the next item finishes, whatever happens last. is there any way i can adapt $.when() for this? i think it's the wrong way around for when (watching for events rather than waiting for a stack of callbacks to happen)
[02:07:45] <devians> hello, is this thing on?
[02:07:56] <devians> (not being rude, just wondering if my bouncer has died)
[02:08:45] <murrrley> Alive and kicking :)
[02:08:55] <devians> oh good.
[02:31:01] <salomonv> hi all, is there a way to debug which events are fired? because I have a specific case where pressing a link goes back instead of to the href of the link
[02:32:52] <devians> salomonv: if you use the inspector on the link your debug window can tell you what events are attached
[02:33:24] <salomonv> devians: will give it a shot, thanks
[02:38:10] <salomonv> well using firebug now but the click event just triggers the click() so that doesn't really help me
[02:43:10] <salomonv> okay so my situation is this: from the index I link to a page, that page has a link with href="#content-1" but instead of going there it goes back to the index after I click it
[02:44:33] <salomonv> the url goes to the right page so refreshing gives the right page but it just doesn't work the first time
[03:00:27] <mape> if I run .stop() on an el that has .delay on it, will that cancel it?
[03:02:56] <lavr-ik> $("a").each(function() { $(this).animate({top: 0}) } - how to make it animated each by each? now they are animating together, i want to separate their animation, next link must be animated only after the previous finished
[03:03:51] <ravenzz> ?delay @ lavr-ik
[03:03:51] <bot-t> lavr-ik, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[03:03:52] <ravenzz> maybe

[03:20:04] <alex-> Is it possible to make a input box larger with css? When you type into it, and it doesn't fits it extends the box
[03:23:01] <Foxandxss> alex-, have you googled?
[03:23:37] <philosophically> so i'm using jquery reject for browser rejection, i'm on ie6 and it's not showing up, looks like there are some errors before it comes on… can someone maybe help me diagnose this? mykazoo.tv is the website… thank you!
[03:23:47] <alex-> Foxandxss: yes, but I only get something like extended box. Not a box that is going larger when it doesn't fits
[03:24:06] <Foxandxss> alex-, you asked 30 secs ago on #css and you came here. Don't lie
[03:24:07] <Foxandxss> :P
[03:24:34] <Foxandxss> anyway, im a good guy today and I googled for you
[03:24:36] <alex-> Foxandxss: they said that it wasn't something that could be done with css
[03:24:40] <Foxandxss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1288297/jquery-auto-size-text-input-not-textarea
[03:24:57] <Foxandxss> that's what you need
[03:25:03] <Foxandxss> a "plugin" for jquery
[03:25:24] <alex-> Foxandxss: it haves to go down, instead of to the right
[03:26:33] <d1b> hi i have a jquery .change bind to a form element and i want to call the bound (change) function every time the value changes(as they type)
[03:26:43] <d1b> how do i go about this?
[03:27:27] <alex->  Do all browsers support jquery?
[03:27:39] <d1b> all good ones do :)
[03:27:46] <alex-> What about the old ones?
[03:27:50] <Foxandxss> alex-, all browsers that have javascript activated
[03:27:57] <alex-> My site would be useless if the browser doesn't supports it
[03:28:02] <alex-> IE 6 supports jquery?
[03:28:09] <Foxandxss> alex-, all browsers that have javascript activated
[03:28:34] <Foxandxss> not every user have javascript activated
[03:28:52] <Foxandxss> but meh, is impossible to make a web without javascript
[03:29:45] <alex-> What happens if the user doesn't haves javascript activated?
[03:30:04] <Foxandxss> your javascript code will be never activated
[03:30:25] <Foxandxss> so if you have the dynamic input thing, that won't work on them
[03:30:35] <alex-> So it will be a small box?
[03:30:36] <Foxandxss> they will have the standard behaviour
[03:30:40] <Foxandxss> yup
[03:30:49] <alex-> Ok
[03:30:54] <alex-> any way to make a form below it?
[03:31:02] <alex-> like having 2 forms when no js
[03:33:20] <Foxandxss> no iea
[03:33:22] <Foxandxss> idea*
[03:35:06] <alex-> Foxandxss: I can't get that form working
[03:35:11] <alex-> Do I have to include the javascript?
[03:35:46] <Foxandxss> you have to include every javascript you use
[03:35:53] <alex-> i did
[03:35:59] <alex-> <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
[03:35:59] <alex-> <script type="text/JavaScript" src="script.js"></script>
[03:37:32] <Foxandxss> that's ok if both files are in the same folder than your html
[03:38:35] <alex-> yes they are
[03:38:49] <alex-> but not working :\
[03:39:30] <alex-> I used these files: http://jsbin.com/ahaxe/edit#javascript,html
[03:40:17] <alex-> Got it working
[03:40:21] <alex-> Pressed download button ;4
[03:46:57] <Foxandxss> lol :P
[03:49:01] <alex-> Is jquery asking cpu power for the server?
[04:09:37] <alex-> Foxandxss: can you help me out a bit, it's going to get complicated.
[04:10:12] <alex-> Foxandxss:  I have this script: http://jsbin.com/ahaxe/edit#source                 but I also want to create a new line of input box (change in the height) and change the submit location
[04:10:13] <Foxandxss> alex-, is not asking for cpu power in the server
[04:11:06] <Foxandxss> I just googled for you, im not a jquery expert, so the create a new line, no idea
[04:12:09] <alex-> Can you google what I mean?:p
[04:12:17] <alex-> Or give the name of it
[04:12:57] <Foxandxss> tried. Seems that what you want is weird
[04:13:07] <alex-> I know
[04:13:12] <alex-> That's why I couldn't find it
[04:13:47] <alex-> I want to extend it to a new line when you put more text in it, or when you don't insert a link in it
[04:18:01] <Foxandxss> alex-, http://jsfiddle.net/janjarfalk/r3Ekw/
[04:18:06] <Foxandxss> with a text-area
[04:18:14] <Foxandxss> textarea*
[04:18:51] <alex-> But don't allow people to resize it themself
[04:19:52] <Foxandxss> you ask for a lot of things at the same time :P
[04:20:22] <alex-> Did I do something wrong?
[04:20:25] <alex-> Not working @ my pc
[04:22:06] <Foxandxss> I mean, you want to archieve many things at the same time
[04:22:15] <Foxandxss> you need to modify one on those plugins
[04:22:42] <alex-> I copied this to my pc: http://jsfiddle.net/9Gdt5/1/
[04:22:45] <alex-> But it isn't working
[04:23:01] <Foxandxss> http://unwrongest.com/projects/elastic/
[04:23:04] <Foxandxss> you need the lib
[04:23:28] <alex-> Foxandxss: http://pastebin.com/G2uFxTne
[04:23:48] <Foxandxss> alex-, download the plugin first
[04:24:08] <alex-> which plugin?
[04:24:13] <Foxandxss> http://unwrongest.com/projects/elastic/
[04:24:17] <Foxandxss> I sent you that already
[04:24:41] <alex-> plugin?
[04:24:43] <alex-> Ah
[04:24:49] <alex-> Didn't saw that link
[04:51:03] <philsturgeon> hey guys. I'm using $(this).serialize() on a form submission which contains a HTML array of "filters". it creates URL's like this: http://local.microwd.com/ajax/feed/home?filters%5Ball%5D=All&filters%5Banswers%5D=Answers
[04:51:23] <philsturgeon> any way to stop it encoding filters[all] like this?
[04:51:41] <lazyPower> You'll have to handle the urlencoding. thats part of serialization philsturgeon
[04:51:56] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: how does one go about doing that?
[04:52:53] <lazyPower> call htmlDecode(string)
[04:54:50] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: where?
[04:55:28] <lazyPower> In your reader when you're parsing the query string.
[04:56:30] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: im sending a GET request to PHP, I dont want to emulate a query string working, i want to make the query string work
[04:56:46] <philsturgeon> the PHP just needs a HTML array passed to it, which should be fine.
[04:57:28] <lazyPower> I dont know what you're trying to accomplish then. You could always serialize the object, then deserialize it on the php side. i do this with a JSON Array of objects and asp.net
[04:57:49] <lazyPower> should be similar to what you're trying to accomplish
[04:58:58] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: heh i'll just manually build the array if jQuery is going to bitch about it
[04:59:16] <philsturgeon> im surprised jQuery wont allow you to send a HTML array. this is perfectly valid http://local.microwd.com/ajax/feed/discover?filters[all]=1
[04:59:21] <lazyPower> No matter how you build it, when you send it, its giong to htmlencode it.
[04:59:40] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: well thats a little retarded
[04:59:45] <philsturgeon> :/
[05:00:28] <lazyPower> its valid, because of how your browser works.
[05:00:39] <lazyPower> just sayin
[05:01:15] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: if my browser accepts it (all browsers accept it) and its part of the HTTP protocol, then jQuery should support it. Pull Request or STFU is a phrase I use a lot, so i'll be fixing this one.
[05:02:13] <lazyPower> ooookay
[05:03:07] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: hmm manually building and sending as post is a workaround
[05:03:31] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: have you not heard the phrase Pull Request or STFU? I run a bunch of projects and say it to everyone because when I hear a bug I tell them to go fix it
[05:03:41] <philsturgeon> so it would be hypocritical if i complain about a bug and dont try to fix it
[05:03:44] <philsturgeon> :)
[05:03:47] <lazyPower> Thats why i mentioned deserializing it on the reader side. ;)
[05:04:01] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: huh? its got nothing to do with deserialising
[05:04:18] <philsturgeon> i should not have to deserialize anything on the server side, jQuery should just send my data properly
[05:04:27] <lazyPower> deserializing will re-build the proper ascii from your urlencoded %50's
[05:04:39] <lazyPower> if you dont want to decode it, then send it in POST form
[05:05:07] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: ok the second part would have been a useful suggestion when I started. This should have nothing to do with modifying the server just to deal with a stupid bug in the client
[05:05:18] <lazyPower> its not a bug though
[05:05:29] <lazyPower> its intended to be that way. Never EVER trust user input.
[05:06:12] <philsturgeon> lazyPower: I can send a HTML array via a GET string if I submit it without javascript
[05:06:20] <philsturgeon> then jQuery comes along and munges it. seems wrong to me
[05:06:29] * lazyPower shakes his head
[05:06:34] <philsturgeon> but meh, post is working and i have a deadline. thanks!
[05:06:44] <lazyPower> you think what ya want ;) i'm happy you got it working.
[05:06:52] <philsturgeon> ;)
[05:07:46] <muzone> Hey!
[05:08:06] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/xXhH7/ - shouldn't my dropdown shopping bag be dropping down when one hovers "(4) Checkout"?
[05:08:46] <muzone> Or is it a requirement that whatever is suppose to drop down be a child of the hover element?
[05:09:23] <lazyPower> hove 'element'?
[05:09:25] <lazyPower> *hover
[05:09:31] <lazyPower> whaaaaat?
[05:09:51] <muzone> come on ladyPower
[05:09:56] <muzone> you know what i mean
[05:11:48] <muzone> lazyPower?
[05:11:54] <delfis> hello, i`m doing $.post. how to show img when loading content? is there a specific way or should i do this manually? show image and then in function when loads hide it?
[05:11:58] <muzone> * lazyPower sorry not ladyPower i misread
[05:12:19] <moo-_-> how can I get hold of widget object based on jQuery selection in jQuery UI?
[05:12:25] <lazyPower> delfis: you can set it on the parent trigger of the $.post event, and on success: hide it.
[05:12:53] <delfis> lazyPower maybe minimal example?
[05:12:56] <lazyPower> muzone: i'm not sure what a hover element is. if its HTML5, i have no idea that it even existed.
[05:13:10] <muzone> lazyPower: nevermind i said hover element
[05:13:25] <delfis> nevermind
[05:13:26] <muzone> i meant the element you hover when you expect the other thing to drop down
[05:13:26] <delfis> i found
[05:13:33] <muzone> lazyPower: did you see my jsfiddle?
[05:14:09] <lazyPower> delfis: $('.woot').click(function() { $.post(function(){ ...options, success: $('loadingimage').hide(); }); });
[05:14:14] <lazyPower> muzone: no
[05:14:53] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/xXhH7/ - how come #dropdown_bag won't drop down when one hovers #bag_indicator?
[05:15:00] <lazyPower> moo-_-: the selectors in jqueryUI are the exact same as those in JQuery.
[05:15:25] <moo-_-> lazyPower: I want to get a hold of Widget() instance based on selector
[05:15:58] <lazyPower> muzone: use the hover or mouseover event
[05:16:26] <muzone> lazyPower: im using hoverIntent, its the same thing
[05:16:42] <muzone> (a bit more accessible and userfriendly though)
[05:21:05] <muzone> lazyPower you there?
[05:25:53] <lazyPower> Not really
[05:26:21] <muzone> lazyPower: my code is clean and should work!
[05:26:25] <muzone> it's worked before
[05:28:20] <lazyPower> http://jsfiddle.net/rRWST/
[05:28:23] <lazyPower> its your selector
[05:29:26] <muzone> lazyPower :D :D :D
[05:30:12] <muzone> lazyPower: still though, shouldnt #dropdown_bag drop down? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/rRWST/1/
[05:30:14] <lazyPower> solutions are usually simpler than you think they are, unless you're doing it wrong.
[05:30:41] <muzone> that can be totally agreed upon sir!
[05:30:54] <muzone> it's just that usually it requires someone well versed to see through to the simpler side of things
[05:31:07] <lazyPower> or you need to take a coffee break ;)
[05:31:12] <lazyPower> just walk away :P
[05:36:22] <lazyPower> Whomever came up with the idea of webforms, deserves to be punched in the neck
[05:40:31] <muzone> any clue lazyPower ?
[05:40:56] <lazyPower> Give it a different container like a span tag and use it as the selector.
[05:41:48] <muzone> lazyPower: doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/rRWST/3/
[05:42:10] <lazyPower> Then somewhere along the line, the selector is either a) getting confused, or b) jsfiddle is munching it.
[05:44:27] <muzone> whatever man
[05:45:55] <lazyPower> muzone: when you fix my conundrum with this legacy webforms app i inherited at work, i'll write your drop down code
[05:45:59] <lazyPower> http://www.coderchuck.com/?p=13
[05:54:12] <muzone> looks tricky as hell lazyPower
[05:54:30] <muzone> i have no power over your problem my son!
[05:56:28] <lazyPower> The long and the short of it is, i need intimate knowledge on how the page lifecycle works and how to bind events which is not happening when i dynamically inject the control because in theory, the page has no idea it exists on init, which is when event binding takes place.
[05:56:39] <lazyPower> so the long and the short of it is... workaround or gtfo
[06:01:02] <muzone> lazyPower: Cool
[06:01:06] <muzone> lazyPower: keep me informed how it goes though
[06:01:09] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cX7Xf/ - why won't #dropdown_bag drop down when you hover the anchor?
[06:36:38] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cX7Xf/ - why won't #dropdown_bag drop down when you hover the anchor?
[06:36:41] <muzone> The same code works just fine for my #dropdown_menu at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cX7Xf/1/

[07:05:27] <afo0l> hey guys, if i want to $.get() an xml resource on Domain A from within a script on Domain B, and i get the Access-Control-Allow-Origin error, i would have to allow the origin on Domain A or Domain B's server settings?
[07:05:42] <afo0l> domain A, right?
[07:11:47] <dabear> afo0l: the site where the resource exists has to allow your request
[07:11:55] <dabear> so domain A
[07:13:21] <afo0l> ok :) thanks
[07:13:52] <afo0l> that's not cool for my purpose, as i want to include another pages newsfeed in my own page
[07:14:36] <afo0l> i could do that in php, but i'd preferred not to make my server waste cycles on that
[07:15:37] <afo0l> is there another method i could use instead?

[07:45:44] <tbranyen> pilgo: $("body").data.events i think
[07:45:49] <tbranyen> just inspect the data
[07:46:38] <tbranyen> er data().events
[07:53:54] <pilgo> tbranyen: That didn't quite work, thanks tho ;)
[07:54:26] <xannax> I have this: jQuery(Document).ready(function(){alert('a');}) It's not firing in chrome. It works in FF....Any idea?
[07:55:33] <walid> hi!
[07:57:56] <walid> i need advice ^^
[07:57:58] <kayam> sup
[07:58:35] <walid> i need some kind of slideshow/cycle, but i can't use different divs, cause of another pludin i use
[07:59:07] <walid> example here: www.vbbros.net/d6/works
[07:59:08] <lazyPower> give it spans with a special class, and encase them that way, or UL's
[07:59:42] <walid> lazyPower: talking to me?
[07:59:44] <walid> :)
[07:59:47] <lazyPower> yep
[08:00:23] <lazyPower> Thats the beauty of using CSS selectors. You can specify any element, and reference them with a class. Perform your background work of hiding the slides and only showing the slide you want, with an animation while iterating through them at x interval.
[08:01:21] <xannax> Please anyone ever had this problem? I have an empty html that loads jquery then fires a ready() event....and it doesn't work in chrome. There isn't anything else in the code, just this. I'm going crazy http://pastebin.com/bBpx7r8V
[08:03:25] <Dreamstar_> xannax:
[08:03:35] <Dreamstar_> Change the D to and d
[08:03:37] <Dreamstar_> Will work :)
[08:03:44] <pen> hey
[08:03:44] <walid> well same with spans
[08:03:53] <Dreamstar_> xannax:  $(document).ready(function(){alert('a');});
[08:03:54] <pen> i'm using $.each how do I pass this into the loop?
[08:04:05] <pen> I tried assign another variable outside but it doesn't work
[08:04:16] <walid> lazyPower: did you see my example?
[08:04:20] <xannax> Dreamstar_, oh god.....I can't believe I lost two hours on this. Thanks!!!
[08:04:30] <Dreamstar_> :D
[08:04:32] <Dreamstar_> nps
[08:04:57] <pen> this in $.each seems to be the value it is iterating over
[08:05:03] <pen> but I need the this outside the loop
[08:05:03] <lazyPower> No. however, if you're aggregating whole elements into a selector without any kind of class selector, you're asking for pain, theres only so many control types in your toolbox you know.
[08:05:37] <lazyPower> i always use somethign like $('div .FancyPlugin').click(....);
[08:10:30] <pilgo> How would i override the "selectstart" event on <body>?
[08:12:58] <walid> lazyPower: well thing is that i dynamically fill a 'page'(a UL with items, so i can't create a slideshow before that... so i thought of writing a plugin myself, and just check how many items i have in my 'page', and move it left or right...
[08:13:11] <walid> www.vbbros.net/d6/works
[08:13:33] <hacksparrow> how do you do: $('li !.selected-tag') ?
[08:13:47] <imsky> $("li:not(.selected-tag)")
[08:13:54] <lazyPower> and what makes you think you cant iterate through those UL's after they are generated and appended to the body of the page?
[08:14:04] <hacksparrow> oh thanks!
[08:14:39] <lazyPower> just chain right off of it and pipe the whole set of objects into another method that will build the slideshow.
[08:15:46] <Jayflux> how do i pass data through .success() when used as a deffered?
[08:16:32] <Jayflux> when it was success:function(data) {$('element').html(data);} < that worked but i can't seem to do it when used the other way
[08:19:20] <walid> lazyPower: cause the list changes while being visited
[08:19:39] <walid> lazyPower: (sry connection problems here ^^)
[08:20:40] <Jayflux> how do i pass data through .success() when used as a deffered?
[08:24:05] <Jayflux> ajpiano you about?
[08:27:27] <lazyPower> hmmm. Ok. not really sure what to recommend then.
[08:30:00] <tbranyen> pilgo: then they weren't jquery events
[08:31:50] <walid> lazyPower: hehe see?
[08:32:08] <walid> lazyPower: i thought maybe i could simply use jscrollbar
[08:32:57] <walid> and tweak it so that it moves the divs in a discrete way rather than continuously
[08:42:35] <pilgo> tbranyen: Hmm..if they weren't query events, what then?!
[08:54:14] <tbranyen> pilgo: sol
[09:10:20] <pilgo> tbranyen, all, let me get to the read goal. I'm writing an extension but that's takes the current page and removes an "selectstart" event handler from <body>
[09:10:34] <pilgo> Ideas?
[09:11:41] <SMutter> Created a modal window with a form in it and changed the content inside after sending the form. When I open the window again, I see the oldest message. How do I reinitialize dialog boxes?
[09:12:58] <SMutter> Or remove the dialog completely after closing?

[09:18:34] <SMutter> Created a modal window with a form in it and changed the content inside after sending the form. When I open the modal dialog box again (with different content to display), I see latest content of the closed one instead. How do I reinitialize dialog boxes?
[09:18:58] <dabear> someone ban SMutter for spamming
[09:21:50] <stevep> How do i parse all UI widgets returned from an ajax request?
[09:37:22] <SMutter> okay, foun a solution for my problem on my own ;-)
[09:58:24] <alex7> I have a an ajax request going to the same page and it works on chrome, but as soon as I try it on an iPad I get an HTTP 403 Forbidden
[09:58:24] <alex7> It's going to a page on the same domain, so no cross site stuff
[09:58:24] <alex7> the weird thing is that if I go to the ajax address directly in the iPad browser, it works
[09:58:45] <alex7> basically the same call works ok on chrome/firefox
[09:59:02] <alex7> this is my $.ajax call http://jsfiddle.net/4Xwbp/
[09:59:18] <alex7> I tried with both relative and absolute urls
[10:29:33] <salomonv> what would be the best way to have a horizontal box that stays on the same position when scrolling?
[10:29:45] <vol7ron> ?
[10:29:58] <widoz> fixed, css
[10:30:32] <salomonv> doesn't position: fixed give you problems with the other content?
[10:32:33] <widoz> salomonv depending how you make a page content, however, fixed position is out of documento flow.
[10:32:43] <widoz> *document
[10:32:48] <salomonv> hmm i'll give it a shot, thanks :)
[10:51:30] <pol> how would one go about using this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4143
[10:51:39] <pol> i tried patch.exe and turtoisesvn, but they do not do anything
[10:59:28] <pulpfiction> good afternoon people
[10:59:45] <pulpfiction> how do i usually override a plugin's defaults?
[11:00:22] <discorpia> pulpfiction: when you initialize it you often pass it a configuration object, like {size: 20, text:'wzup'} etc
[11:00:26] <wgo> pulpfiction, passing options when you call it
[11:01:21] <pulpfiction> yes, i know. but sometimes i want to set some defaults to all following calls to the plugins
[11:01:45] <pulpfiction> so some plugins let you define some defaults... like when you set the locale for jquer ui
[11:02:21] <pulpfiction> so you don't have to repeat your options to every call you're gonna do
[11:03:36] <discorpia> pulpfiction: hmm, many plugins have initialize or constructor functions.
[11:03:46] <discorpia> pulpfiction: or simply a setconfig() function
[11:05:50] <pulpfiction> nah.. i was thinking something more like jquery ui
[11:06:07] <pulpfiction> where you modify the defaults using
[11:06:07] <pulpfiction> $.timepicker.regional['pt-BR'] = {
[11:06:20] <pulpfiction> i mean
[11:06:22] <pulpfiction> $.timepicker.setDefaults($.timepicker.regional['pt-BR']);
[11:07:13] <pulpfiction> so the plugin in question is something like
[11:07:16] <pulpfiction> $.fn.plugInName = function(data, options) { var defaults = { } ...
[11:07:25] <pulpfiction> i was trying to modify these defaults with something like
[11:07:49] <pulpfiction> $.plugInName.defaults.optionModified = true;
[11:14:27] <SMutter> I have a modal window with a form, how do I get the values of input type='text' with the id='user' - it always returns undefined...
[11:15:02] <SMutter> var user = $('#user').val(); is my code but it does not work
[11:15:08] <SMutter> any suggestions?
[11:18:27] <snover> ?unique id @ SMutter
[11:18:28] <bot-t> SMutter, An "id" is a unique identifier. Each time the id attribute is used in a document it must have a different value. If you are using this attribute as a hook for style sheets it may be more appropriate to use classes (which group elements) than id (which are used to identify exactly one element). If you have multiple elements with the same ID, your jQuery WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.
[11:20:26] <Prash7> What is up my nuggets
[11:21:23] <Jarred> Hi all, I'm trying to enable drag'n'drop file uploading to a part of my website. What I'm doing right now is having the input:file sitting on top of an element below it, with an opacity of 0, and have the equivilent of the css hover event via Javascript. What is the correct event for something like onDrop or dropEnter? Here's my page --> http://3prb.localtunnel.com/assignments/1
[11:25:14] <SMutter> Jarred: Sorry I can't help you out (execpt: have you checked the examples on jqeryUI) jut to let you know, that there's not only channel-hoppers here
[11:26:59] <SMutter> I actually can't get the value of an input text/password box out of a form in a modal dialog box. Any help highly appreciated.
[11:29:29] <hsn> hey guys
[11:30:41] <Prash7> hey hsbot
[11:30:43] <Prash7> hey hsn
[11:31:11] <hsn> im new to jq and still learning. i think im stuck at a really simple place but cant figure it out. http://jsfiddle.net/sEu8b/
[11:31:27] <hsn> can anyone take a look and tell me why the div jumps back to its regular height once the animation is done?
[11:34:50] <Prash7> try adding
[11:35:45] <Prash7> I don't see the original animation?
[11:35:55] <Prash7> oh wait one sec
[11:35:57] <hsn> how so?
[11:36:03] <Prash7> Me being a retard, one second
[11:36:07] <hsn> ohok
[11:37:32] <peritpatrio> hsn, try adding overflow:hidden;
[11:38:46] <salomonv> bit of a js noob, is it possible to override a jquery function?
[11:39:01] <Prash7> salomonv what do yuo mean?
[11:39:06] <salomonv> using jquerymobile but I need to alter the behaviour in a particular function
[11:39:20] <salomonv> so I could host the file myself, maybe that's a better option...
[11:39:34] <monokrome> which function?
[11:39:35] <Prash7> you cant change the function but if you define the function again, it will be completely overriden
[11:40:08] <Prash7> hsn i dont have a clue what's up
[11:40:25] <hsn> peritpatrio, that worked like a charm, thanks!
[11:40:59] <salomonv> to be precise, in http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0b3/jquery.mobile-1.0b3.js, in the $.mobile.fixedToolbars = (function() {, I want to override the function show: function( immediately, page ) {
[11:41:00] <Prash7> hsn got a link to that fiddle?
[11:41:33] <hsn> @prash7, http://jsfiddle.net/sEu8b/1/
[11:41:39] <Prash7> <3
[11:41:42] <monokrome> salomonv: What does page do?
[11:42:05] <salomonv> well, I don't really want that, but I think atm it's the only way to alter the behaviour of the function. Because right now the toolbar disappears when I click after i have scrolled and for my app that is really annoying
[11:44:36] <monokrome> Can't you use jQuery.delay to do your 'immediately' functionality?
[11:45:49] <salomonv> well the problem is, after I have scrolled and tap on a word, the header-toolbar disappears, and I can't use that in my application... so I need a way to work around that
[12:11:37] <pilgo> How do I make sure this select acts only when the contents of the respective frames are loaded: $('#iFrame').contents().find('iframe')?
[12:12:17] <Prash7> $('#iFrame').load.function()
[12:12:18] <Prash7> ?
[12:24:15] <geekbuntu> does anyone know how to get the total height of varying number of <p> tags from within a div?
[12:27:46] <pilgo> Prash7: I have this: http://dpaste.de/1xOQq/ . However, line 3 "this" isn't the iframe I selected above.
[12:28:34] <Prash7> you can select it again
[12:28:36] <Prash7> with #iframe
[12:28:46] <pilgo> Prash7: Oh! ok.
[12:28:51] <Prash7> you dont need $($( twice either
[12:30:06] <pilgo> Prash7: I'm doing [0] at the end though
[12:30:17] <pilgo> Because it returns 2 iframes
[12:30:22] <Prash7> ahhh i c
[12:33:38] <drale2k> i am defining a function 'debug' inside the jquery document.ready part, and later i am calling the debug function inside that part and the console tells me that "debug" is not a function
[12:33:45] <drale2k> i guess this is some scope issue?
[12:34:03] <Prash7> upload code pl0x
[12:34:07] <Prash7> jsfiddle of fixee.org
[12:34:09] <Prash7> <3
[12:34:41] <Prash7> try renaming the function and then calling it (like notdebug()0
[12:34:41] <jrockjiggz> drale2k: paste? it sounds like it should work.
[12:35:16] <jrockjiggz> i checked the reserved word list, debug is not on the list.. so it should be free to use
[12:35:32] <jrockjiggz> however, debugger is reserved
[12:36:22] <drale2k> jrockjiggz: http://fixee.org/paste/oyua06v/
[12:37:08] <Jayflux> hey all how can i pass data through using .success() ? Is it the same as when using success within the ajax object?
[12:38:38] <jrockjiggz> drale2k: http://jsfiddle.net/ZwGjW/
[12:38:58] <themudking> anyone built a navigation menu similar to http://lowes.com using jquery?
[12:39:55] <drale2k> jrockjiggz: but i need to check if the var debug is true or not
[12:40:04] <drale2k> so i can toggle debuging
[12:40:33] <Prash7> themudking google 'mega menu' or 'mega nav'
[12:41:45] <jrockjiggz> drale2k: use different name. you are defining the variable as boolean, then assigning it as a function...
[12:42:03] <themudking> thnx Prash7 that is where Ive started, just trying to decide how to handle the two levels of display vertical and horizontal
[12:42:13] <drale2k> jrockjiggz: aren`t that 2 different things?
[12:43:06] <jrockjiggz> drale2k: http://jsfiddle.net/ZwGjW/1/
[12:43:10] <drale2k> jrockjiggz: now it works thanks
[12:43:16] <jrockjiggz> ok np
[12:43:23] <drale2k> but i wonder, how can i overwrite a variable with a function name ?
[12:43:27] <drale2k> did not know that
[12:43:28] <pen> in javascript is there &&= ??
[12:45:27] <jrockjiggz> drale2k: what you would wnat todo then is debug = function();   but this doesn't really make sense..  http://jsfiddle.net/ZwGjW/2/
[12:46:25] <drale2k> jrockjiggz: ähm no, i dont wat to overwrite it, i just asked how can it be that i overwrite a variable with a function name
[12:46:33] <IanWizard-Cloud> I have a mosedown, and a click event on an object.  When I do the mousedown, I set a mousemove event.  If the mousemove gets fired, then I want to cancel the click event that will be fired when I do mouseup.
[12:46:38] <IanWizard-Cloud> Is there any way to do that?
[12:47:00] <juha_> could somebody point me to the general direction of a tutorial that will tell me how to play sounds with javascript
[12:47:04] <drale2k> aren`t a variable name and a function name in 2 different scopes?
[12:47:43] <jrockjiggz> drale2k: good question.. it seems since debug is already defined, the function fails to exist
[12:49:35] <IanWizard-Cloud> Or a way to just prevent the next occurance of an event?
[12:50:24] <jrockjiggz> IanWizard-Cloud: look into unbind();
[12:51:21] <IanWizard-Cloud> jrockjiggz: will it work for just one instance, I didn't think that it would
[12:52:36] <SMutter> I actually can't get the value of an input text/password box out of a form in a modal dialog box. Any help highly appreciated.
[12:53:31] <Prash7> SMutter AFAIK you can't get the value of a password field (or I'm just retarded) and what code are you used for a reg text input? $('#myinput').val(); ?
[12:53:39] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: you can just get $(input_field).val()
[12:53:41] <jrockjiggz> IanWizard-Cloud: unbind('click') would unbind forever.  I guess you could add an IF statement inside the click event, and if(varMouseMoveFlag == 0){ //do click event }else{ //skip }
[12:53:48] <SMutter> It always returns 'undefined' when I try to pick it up with user = $('#user').val();
[12:54:29] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: yes, but look at the value of user
[12:54:46] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: How?
[12:54:49] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: it should return undefined I believe, but the value will be stashed in the var
[12:55:08] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: are you in the console, or saving and then reloading the code.
[12:55:12] <IanWizard-Cloud> *page?
[12:55:56] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: do console.log(user);
[12:56:03] <IanWizard-Cloud> and then look at your console
[12:56:18] <IanWizard-Cloud> (in chrome Ctrl+Shift+J)
[12:56:40] <SMutter> I am working with firefox
[12:56:52] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: then in firebug
[12:57:09] <SMutter> jist have a peek here: http://handball.ws/melder.html
[12:57:11] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: go to the console, and then you can type your code there
[12:57:25] <SMutter> okay
[12:58:40] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: yes, it's working for me
[12:59:01] <IanWizard-Cloud> enter something into the user field, and then do     $('#user').val()      in the firebug console
[13:00:07] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: and same is working for #pass
[13:01:11] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: I can't find a place where to put something into the Konsole. Firebug is open, Console-Tab selected...
[13:01:34] <IanWizard-Cloud> anybody here familiar with firebug?
[13:02:09] <IanWizard-Cloud> you can also type in the url bar...       javascript: alert($('#user').val())
[13:02:17] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: But either way I need to get the value in my script and alert it for testing, that would make me feel really happy :-)
[13:03:02] <IanWizard-Cloud> well then do it in your code
[13:03:20] <Prash7> I dont get what the issue is
[13:03:23] <Prash7> cantu just be like
[13:03:23] <IanWizard-Cloud> either do    var user = $('#user').val();  alert(user)
[13:03:41] <Prash7> var user = $('#user').val(); alert(user);
[13:03:43] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: or just do    alert($('#user').val());
[13:05:33] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: that code I already have in my script, but I get undefined.
[13:05:50] <Prash7> you get undefined in the alert?
[13:05:55] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: I don't understand what is going wrong,
[13:05:56] <Prash7> paste you ur code, jsfiddle or fixee.org
[13:06:41] <SMutter> Prash7: http://handball.ws/melder.html
[13:06:45] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: put it in the code, and save it.
[13:07:28] <pilgo> If "myDiv" is a DOM element, how do I do a selector for an element with id "title"?
[13:07:37] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: what do you mean? I put the alert stuff in the code.
[13:07:40] <pilgo> which is inside "myDiv"
[13:07:57] <Prash7> i keep getting redirected to http://handball.ws/melder.html#/20112012// wtf
[13:08:29] <SMutter> Prash7: that should be like this. 20112012 is the playing season.
[13:08:30] <Prash7> pilgo dont unserstand what you mean?
[13:08:58] <Prash7> SMutter how do i see ur code though? :L
[13:09:32] <SMutter> Prash7: it is just html. open ctrl-u ?
[13:09:36] <pilgo> var myDiv = document.body.childNodes[127]; Now I want to select an element with id of "title" inside "myDiv".
[13:09:57] <Prash7> ohh the code is on that site. Paste the code man, lot easier for us to see + its highlighted
[13:11:49] <SMutter> Prash7: just copy & paste it in here? or where?
[13:12:00] <Prash7> jsfiddle or fixee.org :)
[13:12:03] <pilgo> Prash7: ^^
[13:12:13] <SMutter> Prash7: okay, never been there
[13:12:18] <Prash7> pilgo I'd help if I could haha
[13:12:19] <alessioalex> I'm using the jQuery Form Validator plugin, but I don't want it to add labels to the page with errors. How can I make it not append silly labels everywhere?
[13:12:34] <pilgo> Prash7: No worries :)
[13:12:36] <Prash7> And SMutter they're two great sites, with jsfiddle you can preview ur Js/html/css live :)
[13:13:19] <IanWizard-Cloud> SMutter: add to you input fields   onblur="alert($(this).val());"
[13:14:19] <alessioalex> help?
[13:18:50] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: Amazing. This works.
[13:22:20] <Prash7> alssioalex u still here?
[13:22:30] <Prash7> alessioalex my bad, sorry i dont see anything on the plug page for labels
[13:22:32] <Prash7> so its like
[13:22:33] <Prash7> :/
[13:22:48] <alessioalex> I've figured it out
[13:22:56] <Prash7> awesome
[13:22:58] <alessioalex> var validator = $('#myform').validate();
[13:23:10] <alessioalex> validator.showLabel = function(a,b) { return false; }
[13:23:21] <Prash7> nice one mate
[13:23:23] <alessioalex> I override the damn function :)
[13:23:25] <alessioalex> thanks anyway
[13:23:32] <Prash7> np, sorry
[13:23:38] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: now I changed this to onblur="user=$(this).val()); and it is undefined again. WTF
[13:24:55] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: user is a global variable, initiated in the beginning of the script. I don't really understand what's going wrong here...
[13:25:04] <Prash7> you cant set a var in there
[13:25:07] <Prash7> i dont think
[13:25:24] <SMutter> Prash7: well at least I don't get an error.
[13:25:45] <SMutter> But I indeed get undefined gdmnd
[13:26:36] <pen> is there a &&= in javascript?
[13:26:49] <Prash7> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8a4iiOnzsc <-- answer to EVERYONE's problem, right there
[13:27:32] <SMutter> Prash7: Everything's working now. I forgot the last )
[13:27:41] <SMutter> IanWizard-Cloud: THX, you made my day.
[13:27:43] <Prash7> all thanks to that link
[13:27:53] <dabear> pen: depends .. foo || (foo = "bar")
[13:27:58] <dabear> might do it for you
[13:28:21] <pen> dabear, so I can't do ret &&= (method call); ??
[13:28:55] <SMutter> Prash7: THX for your help as well, I've been sitting for 6 hours on this problem. But now I have to go to bed. Bye
[13:29:01] <dabear> pen: I dont understand what you mean.
[13:29:42] <pen> dabear, I have a array of functions, I will execute everyone of them and all of them return boolean value, I want to return true of all return true otherwise false
[13:32:07] <alex-> eir: why you remove op from yourself?
[13:33:02] <alex-> Who can help me?
[13:33:53] <alex-> I want to let the form change when more text is inserted
[13:35:24] <dabear> pen: do all functions need to be executed?
[13:35:41] <Prash7> alex- be more specific
[13:35:44] <pen> dabear, yes
[13:35:47] <dabear> eg. if you hit a function that returns false, the result will be false anyway
[13:36:28] <alex-> Praise: I want if there is a text pasted more than 1 line, it haves to resize the form
[13:36:39] <sankage> pen: have a boolean var, set it to true, then if any function returns false, set it to false
[13:36:41] <Praise> alex-: you are totally wrong.
[13:36:59] <Prash7> Haha!
[13:37:22] <pen> dabear, so i'm wondering if &&= exists
[13:37:25] <alex-> Praise: what do you mean?
[13:37:46] <Praise> alex-: you was wrong using that tab:)
[13:37:58] <alex-> tab?
[13:38:20] <alex-> Am I missing something?
[13:38:33] <dabear> pen: no, it does not
[13:38:36] <Prash7> yes you wrote Praise instead of Prash in ur reply :L
[13:38:48] <pen> dabear, then can I do ret = ret && method();
[13:39:03] <pen> assuming method returns a boolean
[13:39:13] <pen> or it doesn't matter
[13:39:21] <Prash7> and alex- here is the answer to ur question: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/
[13:39:44] <dabear> you can do that, but both ret and method would have to return true for ret to be true, obviously
[13:40:08] <snover> pen: JS does not work the way you think it does
[13:40:09] <alex-> yes, but it also haves to expand in in the width
[13:40:24] <snover> read up on how boolean operators work
[13:40:32] <alex-> Prash7: ^
[13:40:50] <Prash7> oh right alex-
[13:41:15] <alex-> that example doesn't does that
[13:41:25] <Prash7> i know
[13:41:27] <Prash7> :(
[13:41:35] <alex-> And gives me not a nice layout
[14:04:46] <CannedCorn> are there cdn's for jquery.json and query.cookie
[14:11:46] <CannedCorn> guys?
[14:11:49] <CannedCorn> anyone know?
[14:12:03] <CannedCorn> couldn't find any when i google
[14:12:10] <CannedCorn> googled*
[14:28:54] <booboonathan_> I asked yesterday but does anyone want to earn themselves $10 or a $10 steam GC. Its a fairly simple script
[14:29:14] <alex-> GC?
[14:29:51] <booboonathan_> gamecard
[14:29:57] <alex-> I hope someone can help me out; I'm making an input field, which will be 1 line if you insert 1 line to it, and the width changes dynamicly. When you insert more than 1 line, the width is set to a value (not changing anymore), and the input field his height will become larger, and dynamicly extendable.
[14:30:05] <alex-> What's a gamecard?
[14:30:22] <booboonathan_> alex theres a script for that
[14:30:31] <booboonathan_> in the plugin section
[14:30:43] <alex-> What do you mean?
[14:31:11] <booboonathan_> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/
[14:31:28] <alex-> Yes, but that one is only going down with autoresize
[14:31:33] <Chani> hey, so I'm new to web development, and I'm trying to make a simple neural net demo. what I need is some symbols I can move around and light up. I thought jquery-svg sounded like the right thing, but I can't seem to get animation to work. any tips? am I even using hte right tools?
[14:31:47] <booboonathan_> a small modification to that will mean you can make it go width as well
[14:32:19] <alex-> How?
[14:32:49] <Chani> the only demo I can find turns out to be repeatedly creating and destroying everything instead of trying to actually move things.
[14:32:51] <booboonathan_> do you know javascript?
[14:32:57] <booboonathan_> http://james.padolsey.com/demos/plugins/jQuery/autoresize.jquery.js
[14:33:17] <alex-> no
[14:34:11] <alex-> If there is 1 line inserted, the width haves to change (I already made this).
[14:34:17] <booboonathan_> oh
[14:34:22] <booboonathan_> I actually made something for this haha
[14:34:26] <alex-> If 2 lines are inserted, the width haves to change to a not moving value
[14:34:35] <alex-> And then it haves to go down
[14:34:41] <alex-> I hope you understand what I mean
[14:34:53] <booboonathan_> wait for me coda to start
[14:34:58] <booboonathan_> my*
[14:35:05] <alex-> coda?
[14:35:11] <booboonathan_> yeah mac programming app
[14:35:16] <alex-> Ah
[14:35:20] <alex-> I use gedit :)
[14:35:24] <Chani> does svg animate even work at all, in any browser?
[14:35:25] <alex-> or notepad++
[14:35:34] <alex-> Chani: i thought firefox
[14:35:35] <alex-> but not sure
[14:35:41] <Chani> alex-: I thought so too
[14:35:51] <alex-> not working?
[14:35:59] <Chani> but, using code right from the jquesry svg documentation, it doesn't work. :/
[14:36:09] <Chani> not in ff, not in webkit...
[14:36:50] <booboonathan_> The way that I did it alex- was when they click in the input field it expands
[14:36:54] <alex-> webkit = iron and safari right?
[14:36:56] <booboonathan_> is that not as effective?
[14:37:07] <alex-> booboonathan_: no
[14:37:13] <alex-> It only haves to expand when more text is inserted
[14:37:19] <alex-> See it like a chatboxd
[14:37:24] <alex-> Where you are typing something
[14:37:34] <alex-> It's small, when you type it will become larger in width
[14:37:49] <alex-> But if you copy a whole document to it, the width will become larger (and stay there)
[14:38:00] <alex-> And then it would dynamicly go down
[14:38:09] <Chani> it's weird.
[14:38:48] <Chani> http://keith-wood.name/svgRef.html says to use $(shape).animate({svgX: 200}, 2000);  but that just gives my circle a property "svgX" instead of animating
[14:39:53] <alex-> So it's like combining these 2 scripts:  http://jsbin.com/ahaxe/edit#source    and     http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/
[14:40:07] <alex-> And having the second script to set the width, and not change the width anymore
[14:40:11] <alex-> I hope you understand what I mean
[14:40:55] <alex-> Someone who can help?
[14:47:25] <Chani> AHA!
[14:47:35] <Chani> animate doesn't work, but svg.change does
[14:47:46] <Chani> and, for my purposes, that should be enough.
[14:48:57] <alex-> Chani: can you help me out?
[14:56:27] <DoctorDarren> Gentlemen, I'm trying to get a child input element whose ID starts with a specific string. Is this right?: $(this).children(input[name^="my-string"])   ?
[14:57:37] <ip-route> hi
[15:07:56] <goldstar> hey guys, just switched platforms for my site. When users load the site they get jquery errors (i.e. jquery or $() doesnt exist) but when they refresh page a few times it sorts itself out. I suspect caching issues. Can anyone confirm ?
[15:23:39] <piklu> hii
[16:05:26] <acalbaza> im writing a plugin usign jquery's plugin auth guidelines... what i dont understand is how can i refer to the plugin element's .data() when i delegate calls to private methods?  its as if i have to pass the element reference $(this) to the each private function call, is that right?  it doesnt feel correct...

How can i do something like that?

[16:36:56] <fridgerator> i'm trying to use .get to grab a local .html file and append it to the current html page.  I can create a variable that is equal to the name of the html document i want to get based on which menu item is clicked on, but how do i use that variable as the URL in the .get?  here is a pastebin of the code in question: http://pastebin.com/KXbYZ2Gu
[16:37:40] <fridgerator> is this not possible?
[16:44:53] <djino> hi, is there a jquery event that can behave like this: I press a mousebutton, and I dont release it, while it  in the 'pressed state' a callback gets constantly called
[16:45:01] <Rinthe> http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/us/en/zara-us-W2011/119503/524535/VELOUR%2BBLAZER%2BWITH%2BPIPING if you click the image to zoom and then click again for super zoom. the images moves up and down with position of your cursor. How can i do something like that?
[16:46:55] <coldhead> weren't you asking this like 12 hours ago?
[16:47:11] <coldhead> if not, someone was asking this just 12 hours ago! check the logs for their solution!
[16:48:34] <Rinthe> coldhead: i was
[16:48:41] <Rinthe> hmm let me see i missed it
[16:49:25] <fridgerator> i'm trying to use .get to grab a local .html file and append it to the current html page.

[16:49:34] <meeto> I sure hope someone can help.  I have a list item <li
[16:49:40] <meeto> ooh firdge same question here!
[16:49:51] <Rinthe> coldhead: I don't see any solution tho
[16:50:17] <geekbuntu> anyone know how i can find the total height of <p> tags inside a div?
[16:50:31] <Rinthe> i made something myself but it's not working any ideas? http://codepad.org/LyrXq5sC
[16:51:29] <meeto> I have a list menu tht I would like to link to a details page
[16:53:12] <coldhead> Rinthe: maybe there was no solution, i just remember somone asking, sorry
[16:53:17] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[16:53:31] <Rinthe> np
[16:56:55] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano, ya around?
[16:57:13] <Rinthe> anyone?
[16:57:25] <Dave_Stein> Rinthe ill go take a look at that link on codepad
[16:57:43] <Rinthe> Dave_stein: okay thanks
[16:57:55] <Dave_Stein> Rinthe what are you tring to do? you should look for mousemover on document
[16:58:06] <Dave_Stein> er mousemove
[16:58:30] <Dave_Stein> mouseover and mouseout is fine for .lightbox but not move
[16:58:48] <Rinthe> Dave_stein: I have an image thats long so you have to scroll vertically, but im trying to make it so that the images moves with cursor Y position
[16:59:02] <Rinthe> Dave_stein: http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/us/en/zara-us-W2011/119503/524535/VELOUR%2BBLAZER%2BWITH%2BPIPING if you click the image to zoom and then click again for super zoom. the images moves up and down with position of your cursor.
[16:59:04] <Rinthe> like that
[17:00:07] <Dave_Stein> ya on mousemove its changing the top of the div containing the image
[17:00:17] <Dave_Stein> $(document).mousemove
[17:00:21] <Dave_Stein> not $('#div').mousemove
[17:02:03] <Rinthe> Dave_stein: it still doesnt work. http://codepad.org/lDtthbLs
[17:02:39] <Dave_Stein> $('.lightbox').scrollTop(top); change the top of the div of marin-top
[17:02:43] <Dave_Stein> there is no scrollTop on the DIV
[17:02:52] <Dave_Stein> that would imply there's a scrollbar moving
[17:04:17] <Rinthe> Dave_stein: hmmm what?
[17:04:23] <Rinthe> top of the div of margin-top?
[17:04:25] <Rinthe> lol
[17:04:33] <Dave_Stein> sorry
[17:04:36] <Dave_Stein>  i meant top of the div or marin top
[17:04:39] <Dave_Stein> gah *margin-top
[17:04:43] <Dave_Stein> i'm at home - diff keyboard than i'm used to
[17:05:05] <Dave_Stein> just go to zara and inspect in firebug and you'll see what i mean :)
[17:05:09] <Rinthe> what u mean change the top of the div or margin top
[17:05:10] <Rinthe> hmm
[17:05:17] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: not necessarily a scrollbar moving... if you have overflow:hidden you can still scroll with scrollTop
[17:05:48] <Dave_Stein> gnarf, good point. forgot that for a second. however the example he is showing just uses a relative div that changes top
[17:05:59] <Rinthe> dave_stein: how do i inspect it?
[17:06:09] <Dave_Stein> ?firebug @ rinthe
[17:06:09] <bot-t> rinthe, Firebug - Web Development Evolved: http://www.getfirebug.com/ , FireQuery (firebug enhancements for jQuery): http://firequery.binaryage.com/
[17:06:32] <Dave_Stein> use the console and hit the inspect button... got get used to firebug to do JS
[17:06:36] <Dave_Stein> *gotta get
[17:07:31] <Rinthe> i use the inspect button
[17:07:33] <Rinthe> it just goes to HTML
[17:07:39] <Rinthe> im on chrome btw
[17:07:44] <Dave_Stein> ah ok
[17:07:50] <Dave_Stein> well if you insepect while the image is up you can click on the image
[17:07:53] <Dave_Stein> you'll see it's inside a div
[17:07:58] <Dave_Stein> and while you scroll it will changes its style
[17:08:06] <Rinthe> ya its in div.zoom
[17:08:40] <Rinthe> i don't see it changing tis style
[17:08:52] <Dave_Stein> that's why firebug is better
[17:08:57] <Dave_Stein> i forgot if chrome updates on fly
[17:09:01] <Rinthe> i am using firebug
[17:09:04] <Rinthe> on chrome
[17:09:15] <Dave_Stein> it's never as good there, check it on firefox
[17:11:19] <Rinthe> dave_stein: err i was trying to follow http://valums.com/scroll-menu-jquery/ too
[17:11:22] <Rinthe> its kind of like that
[17:12:23] <Rinthe> just vertical
[17:12:33] <Dave_Stein> one sec
[17:13:52] <Dave_Stein> oh thats a bit much to read ... you should make a demo on jsfiddle.. that would make life easier
[17:14:39] <Rinthe> Dave_stein: its a bit more complicated because i'm doing it on a div that doesn't exist yet
[17:14:49] <Rinthe> .lightbox only shows when the person clicks the image
[17:15:06] <Dave_Stein> you vsn fo $('body').delegate( '.lightbox' )
[17:15:08] <Rinthe> and it seems like $('.lightbox').mousemove(function(e) { alert('hi'); } isn't reading
[17:15:17] <Dave_Stein> yeah you can't bind before the el is there
[17:15:20] <Dave_Stein> ?delegate @ rinthe
[17:15:20] <bot-t> rinthe, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[17:15:50] <Dave_Stein> .mousemove is just a shortcut for .bind
[17:16:12] <Dave_Stein> you vcan use delegate or do $('.lightbox').live ( thats actually better dont know why i suggested delegate )
[17:16:19] <Dave_Stein> ?live @ rinthe
[17:16:19] <bot-t> rinthe, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:16:51] <Rinthe> hm ok let me see
[17:21:14] <Rinthe> ok i got that part working
[17:21:59] <Dave_Stein> cool
[17:22:51] <ragamofin> hi
[17:22:55] <ragamofin> does this make sense?
[17:22:56] <ragamofin> .val(${myObj.nCookies} of cookies)
[17:23:12] <ragamofin> myObj is a span type
[17:23:55] <Dave_Stein> im lost on that
[17:25:48] <cryptopsy> what are some other useful java libs like node.js ?
[17:27:37] <snover> u trollin bro?
[17:31:36] <coldhead> cryptopsy: i like scala
[17:31:42] <coldhead> and frege
[17:32:00] <cryptopsy> thanks
[17:32:08] <coldhead> np
[17:32:29] <cryptopsy> do a lot of people disable javascript due to security concerns?
[17:32:33] <gf3> coldhead, cryptopsy: ruby is pretty good too
[17:32:41] <cryptopsy> i don't like the lang ruby
[17:33:06] <gf3> but the java
[17:33:24] <Dave_Stein> cryptopsy not really... or facebook wouldnt work or any other great site or gmail
[17:33:51] <cryptopsy> okay
[17:36:39] <coldhead> gf3: i like jruby
[17:36:50] <coldhead> i think that runs on node.js
[17:37:17] <ragamofin> cryptopsy: that was more old school, now everything uses javascript :D
[17:37:22] <gf3> coldhead: no no, the real ruby
[17:37:23] <coldhead> javascript is a good language for people who like typing "function () {"
[17:37:33] <gf3> coldhead: I've never used javascript ruby
[17:37:38] <coldhead> ruby runs on node.js?
[17:37:49] <coldhead> so ruby is the java?
[17:37:57] <coldhead> ruby libs*
[17:37:59] <gf3> I think so
[17:38:07] <coldhead> thanks gf3
[17:38:11] <coldhead> i will give it a try
[17:38:35] <gf3> you're welcome, keep trying
[17:38:39] <gf3> you'll get it

[17:54:53] <kenyabob> Ive got a multipage site, with a slideshow function that I run on each page. The function is recursive, and contains a number of callbacks (fadeout, fadein, changed). When I change pages, the last callback fires on the new slideshow. How can I keep from the callbacks from firing when I change pages/
[17:57:17] <White--> hehe interesting, http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ajax.googleapis.com

[18:27:40] <abjorn> coldhead.
[18:27:40] <bot-t> (180 hours ago) <imsky> tell abjorn #jquery is good for the soul
[18:27:45] <abjorn> DOOONT STOP.
[18:27:47] <abjorn> BEEELIEEVIN
[18:28:39] <jrockjiggz> has anyone used sproutcore?
[18:31:29] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky DOOONT STOP BELIIEEEVIIIN in jquery
[18:31:30] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[18:31:50] <nikaoli_> hi abjron
[18:31:54] <nikaoli_> abjorn*
[18:32:04] <abjorn> hola
[18:34:12] <nikaoli_> http://65.75.121.104:8888/motb/
[18:34:32] <nikaoli_> any idea why my "sub menu" div isnt staying inline with the others?
[18:35:45] <nikaoli_> holy sheet
[18:35:58] <nikaoli_> seems to be a firefox issue
[18:36:07] <nikaoli_> i just tried it in safari and it renders semi properly
[18:36:22] <nikaoli_> that's it, ef css and ef jquery, im going back to flash
[18:37:10] <nikaoli_> @.@
[18:37:30] <seancurtis> holy sheet at the horrible contrast of the "Menu" target on that site nikaoli_
[18:37:44] <seancurtis> oh and the miniscule text in the bottom right
[18:37:52] <seancurtis> inacessible much?
[18:38:04] <nikaoli_> inaccessible?
[18:38:12] <seancurtis> wtf table in jbg-wrap...
[18:38:25] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: yes inaccessible
[18:38:43] <nikaoli_> what do you mean exactly
[18:38:50] <seancurtis> do you know what accessibility is?
[18:38:59] <nikaoli_> i think so........
[18:39:10] <seancurtis> oh - you said you were going back to flash - probably means you don't know what it is then :P
[18:39:37] <coldhead> accessibility means blind people can use their site
[18:39:51] <coldhead> or people who type with their tongues
[18:39:51] <seancurtis> accessibility is all about making sure your site is viewable to everyone - blind people or people with vision difficulties
[18:39:54] <nikaoli_> oh......thats what i thought he meant......stuff for disabled people
[18:39:55] <coldhead> all god's special weirdos
[18:40:19] <coldhead> in the UK it is a criminal offense to make your site inaccessible
[18:40:28] <nikaoli_> seriously coldhead ?
[18:40:28] <coldhead> and similar laws are on the way for other countries
[18:40:34] <coldhead> yes
[18:40:43] <coldhead> they take discrimination very seriously
[18:40:50] <nikaoli_> wow........the sci fi movies were giving a prophecy
[18:40:59] <nikaoli_> well im very prejudice then :P
[18:41:00] <seancurtis> having 8px brown text on a black background = impossible to read. The serif font doesn't make it any easier either
[18:41:08] <coldhead> yes, orwell's 1984 was basically about web standards
[18:41:13] <coldhead> the nightmare of equality
[18:41:30] <nikaoli_> serious stuff.....
[18:41:31] <snover> coldhead you are on fire today.
[18:41:39] <snover> does it hurt?
[18:41:47] <stevep> is it possible to manually render jquery ui elements returned from and ajax load?
[18:41:48] <coldhead> snover: please kill me
[18:41:54] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: take a look at using CSS transitions as well - you'll get much smoother fading in/out than animating with jquery
[18:42:23] <nikaoli_> i tried using the css transitions and ran into a dead end, I dont remember exactly what the dead end was, but i ended up having to use jquery
[18:42:59] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: there's a jquery plugin which takes care of it for you
[18:43:14] <seancurtis> it'll use CSS transitions if the browser supports them, if not it falls back to jQuery animations
[18:43:30] <nikaoli_> oh snap.....what's it called?
[18:43:46] <nikaoli_> and why does my menu look different ins safari?
[18:44:18] <stevep> i have a center pane area on my page that loads up content with ajax, but the html that comes back doesn't properly render the widgets
[18:46:06] <coldhead> yes what IS that called, seancurtis
[18:47:11] <seancurtis> is google down?
[18:47:50] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transition.js
[18:48:13] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: also https://github.com/benbarnett/jQuery-Animate-Enhanced
[18:48:51] <coldhead> google gives a lot of 1980s stuff when i ask for jquery+css+transitions
[18:49:55] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: I think you want the first link
[18:50:34] <stevep> i know dojo has dojo.parser for what i need to do, but im not sure how the same is accomplished in jquery
[18:51:01] <nikaoli_> im pretty new to using jquery
[18:51:02] <coldhead> $.getScript('dojo.min.js')
[18:51:06] <coldhead> me too nikaoli_
[18:51:08] <nikaoli_> it appears daunting.....
[18:51:34] <coldhead> it's less daunting than bare naked JS in the nasty gnashing teeth of diverse browsers
[18:51:55] <seancurtis> nikaoli_: it shouldn't really make it that much different - that plugin should just convert your JS animations to CSS ones for you if the browser supports it
[18:52:00] <coldhead> selectors, chaining and callbacks, once you're comfy with them you'll be fine
[18:52:12] <nikaoli_> i see
[18:52:13] <abjorn> coldhead just started today
[18:52:22] <coldhead> it's true
[18:52:29] <coldhead> mere hours ago
[18:52:54] <nikaoli_> i kind of want to avoid typing CSS, which i am also new to
[18:53:18] <abjorn> css is annoying
[18:53:19] <abjorn> just saying
[18:53:27] <stevep> i find css soothing
[18:53:49] <stevep> my brain shuts off and i just type out what needs to be styled, and refresh and check
[18:53:49] * nikaoli_ sigh
[18:54:09] <stevep> css is better classified as mundane
[18:54:35] <nikaoli_> css is a girl that plays hard to get
[18:54:37] <stevep> but does anyone know if there's a master parsing mechanism in jquery ui?
[18:55:29] <abjorn> parsing what
[18:55:57] <stevep> ui widgets
[18:56:09] <stevep> returned via ajax
[18:56:37] <stevep> they show up, but they don't function because they are only parsed on page load
[18:59:14] <seancurtis> CSS is easy - just gotta keep things simple - build up the styles bit by bit
[18:59:20] <seancurtis> break things up into blocks
[18:59:26] <seancurtis> and style them one by one
[18:59:45] <seancurtis> oh - and try to avoid having to support IE6/IE7 :)
[18:59:46] <abjorn> jQuery does that afaik stevep
[19:00:38] <abjorn> It's possible there's some lightweight parsing mechanism in jQuery UI that splits it up into chunks that jQuery can better handle, though. Take a look at the source I guess.
[19:00:45] <stevep> abjorn: i wouldn't expect it to, most of the widgetification happens on document ready
[19:01:27] <abjorn> Well, you can feed jQuery a string with an element declaration to create a new DOM element, is what I mean.
[19:01:33] <stevep> abjorn: the widgets have js functionality that is not being applied to them because i would need to call some function on them
[19:01:44] <stevep> yeah so that would put it in the dom
[19:02:14] <stevep> but then you would have to initialize the widget somehow
[19:03:37] <coldhead> are we supposed to use SASS and Less instead of CSS now?
[19:03:40] <coldhead> that's what i heard
[19:03:45] <coldhead> from Chad Sexington
[19:03:55] <coldhead> at Global Internet Marketing Conf 2010
[19:08:39] <bluenavajo> hi all
[19:12:04] <bluenavajo> I have a basic html question about positioning div elements. Let's say I have two divs, second one under the first. And each div contains a relative positioned element. Does the first one push the other downwards if it's size grows? Or does it overlap?
[19:19:53] <skimcalf> hey there. i'm developing a plugin that needs to have methods that operate generally on the entire page vs. individual elements. is there a convention for this? $.myPlugin.doGeneralThing()?
[19:20:48] <seancurtis> bluenavajo: should do
[19:21:01] <seancurtis> bluenavajo: best way to know is play around with it in the browser
[19:21:26] <seancurtis> skimcalf: have you read the tutorials on the jquery site? They provide a pretty good baseline for plugin development
[19:22:15] <skimcalf> i didn't see anything on calls to the plugin without elements, but i'll look again
[19:26:58] <glaksmono> hello, i'm using live('click', and then sending a post AJAX request, but for some reason the POST request is sent twice, any ideas what's the problem? I already made sure that the JS is loaded only once :(
[19:27:32] <coldhead> are you clicking twice?
[19:27:50] <seancurtis> glaksmono: are you binding the click to 2 elements? What selector are you using?
[19:27:55] <coldhead> maybe you are binding to multiple elements and both are receiving click events?
[19:28:29] <seancurtis> don't do $('div').live('click', ... ) for example
[19:31:28] <skimcalf> thanks
[19:35:12] <glaksmono> seancurtis: i do  something like this $('.foo-opt').live('click', function() {
[19:35:34] <glaksmono> that should be fine right?
[19:36:17] <seancurtis> glaksmono: depends whether or not you have nested .foo-opt elements or not
[19:36:37] <seancurtis> events bubble up - if you have a .foo-opt inside a .foo-opt then the click event in the innermost one will bubble up and you'll get 2 events
[19:36:57] <glaksmono> seancurtis: no it deosn't have nested element :-/
[19:38:18] <seancurtis> then probably dupe JS
[19:38:20] <seancurtis> my guess
[19:40:24] <glaksmono> hmmm
[19:40:37] <glaksmono> well initially i printed on the console the event listener is only executed once
[19:40:42] <glaksmono> so it's not gonna be dupliat for sure
[19:52:29] <coldhead> black velvet
[19:52:45] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[19:53:00] <tonyjcamp> and that little boy smile?
[19:53:07] <tonyjcamp> sorry, wrong window.
[19:53:41] <coldhead> :D
[19:54:56] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: where in the world are you?
[19:55:05] <tonyjcamp> I heard someone say aussie?
[19:55:23] <coldhead> yes
[19:55:35] <coldhead> where are you
[19:55:57] <tonyjcamp> Arizona.
[19:56:10] <coldhead> deserty
[19:56:11] <tonyjcamp> Cowboys, and gila monsters.
[19:56:14] <tonyjcamp> yes sir.
[19:56:29] <coldhead> gila monsters are very important in my mythology
[19:56:34] <tonyjcamp> oh?
[19:56:35] <coldhead> even though i don't know what they are
[19:56:38] <tonyjcamp> haha
[19:56:39] <coldhead> AND DON'T WANT TO KNOW
[19:56:56] <tonyjcamp> They're single moms that are easy to pick up on.
[19:57:04] <tonyjcamp> oh wait, that's cougars… I'm all confused.
[19:57:56] <coldhead> that's actually very similar to their position in my mythology
[19:58:00] <tonyjcamp> What's it like living so close to Olivia Newton John?
[19:58:07] <tonyjcamp> Is she nice?
[19:58:20] <coldhead> she is a little aloof
[19:58:25] <coldhead> never returns my calls
[19:58:30] <coldhead> never visits
[19:58:45] <coldhead> but it has little impact on my, in daily life
[19:59:18] <tonyjcamp> She's busy getting physical, that or she's not as hopelessly devoted to you as I thought.
[19:59:26] <cryptopsy> why are you talking about your mother in this channel
[19:59:45] <tonyjcamp> Well, mostly because she's my caregiver
[19:59:52] <coldhead> i am going to pretend i don't grasp those references
[19:59:53] <tonyjcamp> and pays the rent for my basement.
[19:59:58] <tonyjcamp> hahah AHAHAH
[20:00:01] <tonyjcamp> You know you did.
[20:00:19] <tonyjcamp> Almost threw in a "summer login'" but that's WAY to easy.
[20:00:20] <coldhead> i don't know any popular music since the 1830s
[20:00:30] <coldhead> assuming that's what you're talking about
[20:00:43] <tonyjcamp> Mid to late 1830's… mostly
[20:05:20] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: what other rooms are worth checking out? #html5, #whatwg, #studsinlove?  what else?
[20:05:53] <coldhead> i don't care for other channels
[20:06:24] <coldhead> until my ban from ##php is lifted i will continue to boycott other channels
[20:07:36] <tonyjcamp> How did you get banned?
[20:08:00] <coldhead> too much "truth"
[20:08:18] <tonyjcamp> ahahah
[20:08:29] <tonyjcamp> Truth hurts, so does WP development.
[20:57:24] <jimubao> hey guys ? how can i get the vaule inside <code></code> tag
[20:57:38] <jimubao> eg f i have <code> hello </code>
[20:57:51] <jimubao> how cna i get the hello value ?
[20:58:07] <jimubao> i tried $('code').val()
[20:58:41] <jimubao> should i give it a class ?
[20:59:00] <coldhead> $('code').text()
[20:59:05] <coldhead> ?text @ jimubao
[20:59:05] <bot-t> jimubao, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[20:59:13] <coldhead> val() is just for inputs
[20:59:25] <jimubao> ok i wil ltry that thanks
[21:00:23] <jimubao> thank coldhead
[21:00:26] <jimubao> it works
[21:00:34] <coldhead> jimubao: you are welcome
[21:00:35] <jimubao> what id i wanna highlight it ?
[21:00:43] <jimubao> $('code').text().select()
[21:00:57] <coldhead> you have to use a plugin for that
[21:01:02] <coldhead> ask google
[21:02:07] <abjorn> Or bot-t
[21:02:12] <abjorn> he knows how to gewgle
[21:07:25] <abjorn> coldhead: I am so confused about all this terminology everyone is using for all the new things they're thinking of putting in javascript
[21:07:31] <abjorn> like harmony, es.next, es6
[21:07:34] <abjorn> i so confuzed
[21:13:03] <coldhead> abjorn: you don't need to know
[21:13:21] <coldhead> if you're a JS tragic you will be obsessed and already know
[21:13:40] <coldhead> but none of it will be in 95% of browsers before the apocalypse
[21:14:10] <coldhead> you should worry about more relevant things, like how much to tip waitresses
[21:14:12] <abjorn> hahaha
[21:14:19] <abjorn> psh
[21:14:27] <coldhead> or taxi drivers!
[21:14:29] <abjorn> I tip whatever the hell i feel like (and can afford)
[21:14:32] <abjorn> I got that figured out.
[21:15:01] <abjorn> what do you mean a js tragic anyways
[21:15:34] <coldhead> like rwaldron or jdalton or brendan eich or papa crockford
[21:15:45] <coldhead> the people who go on and on and on about JS
[21:15:58] <coldhead> and have Strong Opinions about every aspect
[21:16:03] <abjorn> I'm known to do that in other channels...
[21:16:13] <abjorn> I don't have strong opinions about every aspect, though.
[21:16:35] <abjorn> most of my github projects are javascript based or related lul
[21:16:53] <coldhead> but you're developing JS
[21:17:08] <abjorn> Instead of talking about it?
[21:17:09] <coldhead> you have opinions about Actual Javascript
[21:17:14] <coldhead> as She Is Spoke
[21:17:15] <abjorn> lol
[21:17:23] <coldhead> not imaginary fairy princess sparkle pony JS
[21:17:27] <abjorn> to be fair, I like the crock
[21:17:31] <coldhead> that may eventually be available somewhere
[21:18:25] <abjorn> you know, if twitter is to believed, it seems like theres a js related conference like every other fuckin week
[21:18:32] <abjorn> how does anybody get any work done?
[21:19:15] <coldhead> they leave it for us to do
[21:19:39] <coldhead> i had to work all weekend just because capitol JS and strange loop were on
[21:19:59] <abjorn> work on what?
[21:20:38] <coldhead> just all this regular run of the mill stuff
[21:20:45] <coldhead> using Actual JS and Actual CSS
[21:20:49] <abjorn> haha
[21:21:01] <coldhead> html4.999999
[21:21:03] <abjorn> and helping people in #jquery?
[21:21:17] <coldhead> oh god no, i'd never do that
[21:21:21] <abjorn> never
[21:21:24] <coldhead> what have they ever done for me?
[21:21:29] <coldhead> besides, it's my first day
[21:21:34] <abjorn> right, right
[21:21:35] <abjorn> day 1
[21:21:40] <abjorn> dawn of the first day
[21:25:00] <abjorn> man i am too tired for this c++ shit
[21:25:04] <abjorn> fuck you, c++, fuck you
[22:16:46] <sasori> question: why am i getting the value "on" whenever i do jQuery('input[name="gender"]').val() from the firebug console? here's my code http://jsfiddle.net/qL9W6/1/ .. ( i should get 1 ) :(
[22:20:46] <sasori> or rather, I should get 0 if it's set to 0 from the table
[22:22:29] <sasori> pfft..nevermind..solved..i forgot to add value :|
[22:27:24] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[22:27:34] <ProLoser|Work> $.makeArray() doesn't appear to be working for an object/map
[22:27:46] <ProLoser|Work> very annoying that object is the name for both a function AND a map
[22:28:08] <ProLoser|Work> i mean function
[22:28:27] <ProLoser|Work> any suggestions?
[22:28:40] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying to use tmpl() but it's not accepting $.makeArray(someObject)
[22:32:44] <ProLoser|Work> can someone help me?
[22:40:36] <ProLoser|Work> No idea why i get this: Property 'tmpl' of object #<Object> is not a function
[22:48:01] <ProLoser|Work> any syntax errors with this? http://pastebin.com/VRqq7zXy
[22:51:13] <FreeChoice> consider: <p class="foo bar"></p>. How do i get the value of the first class name?
[22:51:54] <FreeChoice> $('p').attr('class'); gives 'foo bar'
[22:53:39] <Haprog> I think theres some slice function you can use to slice with space " " and get an array, then just read the first entry.
[22:55:17] <Haprog> but class names aren't meant to be ordered and you shouldn't count on them being in some proper order.
[22:57:18] <FreeChoice> Haprog: no worries.
[22:59:11] <Davey> FreeChoice: perhaps you want hasClass?
[22:59:41] <FreeChoice> Davey: Already there ;)
[23:00:13] <Davey> :)
[23:00:52] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[23:00:57] <ProLoser|Work> can someone help me out?
[23:01:19] <Davey> ProLoser|Work: maybe if you asked question (related to jquery :)
[23:01:33] <ProLoser|Work> i did
[23:02:12] <ProLoser|Work> http://pastebin.com/VRqq7zXy i'm getting an error saying that tmpl() is not a method of #<Object>
[23:02:34] <ProLoser|Work> can't figure out why
[23:06:33] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: you paste id is invalid.
[23:06:43] <ProLoser|Work> 10 minutes must hav passed lol
[23:06:55] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: i guess so.

[23:07:57] <Edulix> hi people, how can I dynamically load a java applet at any time using jquery?
[23:09:12] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: also provide error message your getting.
[23:10:25] <coldhead> Edulix: $('div.container').append('<applet tag soup></applet>')
[23:10:28] <Davey> Edulix: wow, why would you want to? I leave pages that try to do that :)
[23:10:29] <coldhead> that should do it
[23:10:31] <Davey> coldhead: heh
[23:10:58] <Edulix> coldhead: thanks
[23:12:25] <sasori> question: is there a way to make the datepicker appear at the bottom of the input form when clicked?, because apparently my datepicker appears at the top
[23:12:48] <ProLoser|Work> i can't copy it and i've provided it like 4 times
[23:14:16] <coldhead> sasori: CSS?
[23:14:58] <sasori> coldhead: i tried showAnim: slideDown ..didn't work
[23:15:08] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: firstly, i don;t think Array is an Object
[23:15:46] <ProLoser|Work> so?
[23:15:46] <Lampoon> so are you
[23:15:49] <coldhead> no no, i mean set the CSS for the picker
[23:16:13] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: so i don;t think you can use instanceof for Array
[23:16:33] <coldhead> like um form {position:relative;} .datepicker {position:absolute;bottom:0}
[23:16:53] <ProLoser|Work> if it fails it fails
[23:17:07] <coldhead> god that is so true
[23:17:32] <ProLoser|Work> coldhead: can't you do my/at?
[23:18:01] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: and not sure about typeof data == "object"
[23:18:37] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: here in this case you might want instanceof Object
[23:19:26] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: HTH
[23:19:33] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[23:19:43] <sasori> cool, thanks coldhead :) +1
[23:22:38] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: HTH = hope that helps :)
[23:25:20] <ProLoser|Work> not really
[23:25:29] <ProLoser|Work> not at all
[23:25:47] <FreeChoice> ProLoser|Work: sorry bro. thats all i got.
[23:27:24] <coldhead> i have no clue what your code is doing, ProLoser|Work
[23:27:37] <coldhead> so i can't tell how it's broken
[23:27:44] <coldhead> also i have severe brain damage
[23:29:00] <FreeChoice> Guys, i'm trying to open this dialogue from HTML. is it possible? http://jsfiddle.net/RfPbj/1/
[23:46:40] <ProLoser|Work> c.tmpl is not a function
[23:46:43] <ProLoser|Work> what does this mean?
[23:48:11] <Hooloovoo> ProLoser|Work: That c.tmpl is not a function.
[23:49:10] <Hooloovoo> Maybe because c is not a jquery object or maybe because you don't have the tmpl plugin.
[23:51:08] <mike__b> I'd like to start using The Grid in one of my projects; but apart from some status messages in the Wiki some months ago, it's not announced in the 1.9 JQuery UI betas. Can anybody tell the status? http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/02/unleash-the-grid/
[23:53:10] <ajpiano> mike__b: grid isn't slated to be specifically part of 1.9 as of now
[23:53:21] <n3rddotnet> hey guys
[23:53:27] <n3rddotnet> how do i make .ajax calls for subdomain?
[23:53:40] <Cork> n3rddotnet: you don't
[23:54:02] <Cork> unless your ok with dropping support for all ie browsers and most not top of the line browsers
[23:54:39] <Cork> you need to set csp headrs and the browser has to understand what that means
[23:54:40] <n3rddotnet> Cork, that's fine
[23:54:49] <n3rddotnet> Cork, i am doing this for testing, so that's totally fine with me
[23:54:49] <Cork> ?mdc csp
[23:54:53] <n3rddotnet> Cork, how do i do it?
[23:54:53] <bot-t> Cork, CSP (Content Security Policy) - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/security/csp
[23:55:18] <Cork> ?mdc access control
[23:55:23] <bot-t> Cork, HTTP access control - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[23:55:35] <Cork> n3rddotnet: those should get you going
[23:55:51] <ajpiano> n3rddotnet: if you just set document.domain
[23:55:55] <ajpiano> you can do ajax between subdomains
[23:55:56] <ajpiano> https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Document.domain
[23:56:08] <Cork> ajpiano: you need to use iframe then though
[23:56:15] <ajpiano> no you don't
[23:56:27] <Archaic_G> anyone know how to make jplayer work on blackberry via webapp ?
[23:56:30] <Cork> but the other domain won't allow you unless it sets it too
[23:56:35] <ajpiano> ya
[23:56:36] <mike__b> ajpiano: thanks, I already was afraid of that. The first schedules talked about release in September or so. And while there are very large names as sponsors which looks nice, I can't seem to find any real progress reports or such, which does not sound really trustworthy. Or am I wrong?
[23:56:42] <ajpiano> that's what i was implying
[23:57:15] <Cork> ajpiano: and you can't set document.domain in an ajax responce, so iframe that does the ajax
[23:57:27] <Cork> unless i'm missing something
[23:57:28] <ajpiano> why would he set document.domain in the ajax response...?
[23:57:40] <ajpiano> mike__b: there's nothing untoward going on
[23:57:45] <ajpiano> if that's what you're insinuating
[23:57:58] <ajpiano> mike__b: there are weekly grid progress meetings on wednesdays on 1:30 on irc
[23:58:14] <coldhead> it all seems pretty suspicious to me
[23:58:17] <Cork> ajpiano: sub1.domain.org => sub2.domain.org, when sub1 wants to do ajax to sub2.domain.org it won't be allowed unless sub2.domain.org sets it too
[23:58:23] <coldhead> subdomains are for subhumans
[23:58:24] <ajpiano> Cork: i know.
[23:58:29] <FreeChoice> ajpiano: what channel?
[23:58:37] <ajpiano> i meant "set document.domain in both places"
[23:58:40] <Cork> ajpiano: and as far as i know, only js is allowed to set it, right?
[23:58:42] <ajpiano> FreeChoice: #jquery-meeting
[23:58:46] <ajpiano> Cork: yes...
[23:59:10] <ajpiano> FreeChoice: jquery core meetings on monday, mobile on tuesday, ui and grid on wednesday
[23:59:16] <Cork> so, you need to load a broker from sub2 that sets the document.domain and does the ajax calls
[23:59:22] <n3rddotnet> Cork, i m on it
[23:59:40] <FreeChoice> ajpiano: you part of any of those meetings?
