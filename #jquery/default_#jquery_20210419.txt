[00:06:56] <Absolum> Is there any way to get the bounding rectangle of a jquery collection of elements? I need the equivalent of getBoundingClientRect() for the collection of elements?
[00:07:39] <Absolum> Right now I iterate through the entire collection to find the xyMin and xyMax values and then derive the other values from there. There must be a faster way
[00:07:41] <robertmaxrees> you can access the underlying dom node and run that method on it if need be.
[00:08:12] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to enumerate through the collection for that either way.
[00:08:13] <Absolum> but only if it exactly contains the collection. The collection of items may be in different scopes
[00:08:47] <robertmaxrees> not sure how scope matters here - you can make a utility function and pass in the collection you care about explicitly.
[00:10:56] <Absolum> I got the alignment proxy thing to work pretty well and it makes it easy to align things by 9 different reference points. So you can use the phrasing: objecta.TL=objectb.TL and the objecta will move until it's Top Left coordinate matches the TL coordinate of objectb
[00:11:50] <robertmaxrees> none of that really changes what i said though :)  it sounds like you need to create a function that takes the collection and go from there.
[00:47:15] <Absolum> Finally, I got it to work. Now, maybe It can be optimized considerably, but at least it's a proof of concept. Now to tackle distribution--rough!  https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/mdRjQNL?editors=1111

[10:38:17] <sqpp> Anything wrong with this perhaps?
[10:38:44] <sqpp> My footer seems to be ok, but the header doesn't display correctly.
[10:55:25] <Tom8> Hi, Im new to jquery,
[10:58:46] <Tom8> I have a small problem with my query, anyone that can please assist?
[10:59:16] <shoky_> just ask
[11:00:08] <Tom8> where can i dump my code
[11:00:24] <shoky_> jsfiddle.net
[11:00:36] <Tom8> thanks will do...
[11:13:25] <Tom8> https://jsfiddle.net/1Lbztjwf/          I have 2 products with each one its own qty dropdown, on change it must read the value in the dropdown
[11:19:03] <shoky_> try doing it with jquery? ;)
[11:20:03] <Tom8> can you please look at my code
[11:20:44] <shoky_> i did
[11:21:20] <shoky_> it's not using jquery. and you shouldn't use onXXX attributes in html - bind the event handlers in JS/jquery
[11:21:56] <shoky_> e.g. $('#quantity0').on('change', function() { ... });
[11:29:39] <qzartz> hii
[11:32:36] <qzartz> uh
[11:34:01] <Tom8> If I use form post, and read the post values, i can get to the values, the only problem the user must click a button, I thought to use html onchange event using a script
[11:58:35] <Cork> shoky_: slight adjustment, one shouldn't use on attributes at all, its a 25 year old legacy feature :)
[15:48:29] <Absolum> I need a better way to attach anchors to my elements than how I am doing it. Any suggestions? https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/JjEaxNB?editors=1111
[15:48:38] <Absolum> hover over a square to view/select an anchor
[15:49:36] <robertmaxrees> lots of code there - which section is concerned with adding those anchors?
[15:51:02] <Absolum> right now they are done with css and then jquery is used to activate them.
[15:51:20] <Absolum> If I add anything to the boxes they get messed up
[15:51:41] <robertmaxrees> so there's a bug you're trying to resolve?
[15:51:44] <Absolum> So I need a way to add these anchors to any shape without modifying the shape....maybe a wrapper?
[15:53:17] <robertmaxrees> you've made like three separate problem statements so i'm not sure what to suggest :)
[15:55:48] <Absolum> So you are unable to see what I am trying to do? Or you are just being supportive by forcing me to ask the right questions?
[15:57:35] <robertmaxrees> your first question was "is there a way to improve how i'm accomplishing this task?"  the second question was "if I add things to this box, it gets "messed up"".  the third question was "i need a way to add these anchor points without changing the shape of the element".
[15:59:24] <Absolum> Gosh, it seems pretty clear to me. That's why I wasn't sure where the confusion was. I need to put 9 anchor points on an element in such a way that they don't change the contents of the element and aren't affected by the contents of the element. Any suggestions on who to make it look like it does now, but solve the additional problems if I add a label to the box, for example (it throws off
[15:59:25] <Absolum> the anchors as it is now)
[15:59:48] <robertmaxrees> can you show any of the bugs you're having?
[15:59:53] <robertmaxrees> so i can better see what's up?
[16:00:24] <Absolum> https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/JjEaxNB?editors=1111
[16:00:51] <Absolum> using just the destionation box in the middle. Adding content to it messes with the anchors.
[16:00:59] <Absolum> mouse over to see the messed up anchors
[16:01:50] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[16:02:08] <Absolum> So I was thinking I could wrap the box in a wrapper, add the anchors to the wrapper, but how do I ensure that the wrapper matches the size/position of the box inside it?
[16:02:39] <robertmaxrees> could have a separate div that's a sibling that's sized to fit a parent container for both elements.
[16:03:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a great #css question :)
[16:03:24] <Absolum> I'll be doing it programmatically in jquery, but i'll ask there, thanks.
[16:03:41] <robertmaxrees> positining the elements using jquery?
