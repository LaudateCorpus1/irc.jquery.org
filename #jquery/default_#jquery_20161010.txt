[00:37:39] <mukti> Right now I have to following code to open a link based on an ajax query - https://github.com/3ricG/Userscripts/blob/master/AnimeBytes/AddForumLogLinks.user.js
[00:38:10] <mukti> If I middle click or right click > Open in new window, I just get "
[00:38:23] <mukti> javascript:void(0)
[00:38:25] <mukti> (expected)
[00:38:43] <mukti> Is it possible to handle this so that the links could be opened in a new window/tab?
[00:49:47] <mukti> Is what I'm asking for possible, or will users just have to deal with opening in the same window?
[00:53:45] <mukti> Is there any way to pre-process before getting handed off to the new tab?
[01:23:12] <azx> hello
[01:23:13] <azx> https://gyazo.com/f6348446e972a9d70c52721778475bfa
[01:23:20] <azx> how do i get it to background: black;
[01:23:27] <azx> when the element specified is clicked?
[01:23:56] <azx> ive tried multiple ways of doing this
[01:24:06] <azx> and i'm stumped, this was my last resort
[01:24:46] <azx> is the css selector wrong
[01:24:59] <azx> does jquery allow spaces
[01:27:28] <azx> what about this:
[01:27:29] <azx> https://gyazo.com/201b1b642fa37fecc920f2efe92b0b75
[01:28:53] <azx> ah i have a duped line in there...
[01:30:38] <azx> got it working! :)
[01:30:42] <azx> thanks all
[02:30:05] <Ziberius> hello
[02:30:31] <Ziberius> any idea how to scroll horizontally on clicking a button?
[02:38:18] <Cork> Ziberius: just change scrollLeft
[02:38:29] <Cork> (or scrollX if you are on document)
[04:16:08] <fjeessdd> hey, i have a conceptual questoin about promises and callbacks, why are callbacks error first parameter but promises are error second?
[04:20:36] <sonu_nk>  hi is there any way to detect pdf or doc file is rendring on page or not ? i am not getting any .pdf extention in url .. but can see ajax request in console..
[04:28:59] <Cork> fjeessdd: not sure what you're talking about
[04:29:10] <Cork> when you call what functions?
[04:29:36] <Cork> sonu_nk: ajax doesn't get rendered
[04:29:49] <Cork> sonu_nk: it returns the result as data to javascript
[04:30:35] <sonu_nk> Cork: Is there any way yo track wht extention is being loaded ?
[04:30:52] <Cork> http resources doesn't have extensions
[04:30:55] <Cork> it has content-type
[04:31:10] <Cork> and only the response shows what content type the data is
[04:31:39] <Cork> meaning http://www.example.com/test.html could be a completely valid pdf file
[04:31:51] <Cork> (and the browser will see it as a pdf file)
[04:33:22] <fjeessdd> hey cork, its just that callbacks are like (function(err,data){}) while promises are .then(data,err), just wondering why the parameters are reveresed
[04:33:38] <fjeessdd> if there is some reason
[04:34:15] <Cork> fjeessdd: variable returns depends on what hooks the callback is for, so again what are you referencing to?
[04:34:47] <fjeessdd> why does it go (err,data) to (data, err)
[04:35:17] <Cork> in what reference?
[04:35:26] <Cork> what are you giving the function to?
[04:35:40] <fjeessdd> do you know the concept of callback and promise?
[04:35:53] <Cork> sure, but you haven't given the relevant info
[04:36:06] <Cork> for promise you gave you run .then
[04:36:13] <Cork> but for "callbacks" you didn't
[04:36:42] <Cork> so i can't answer why something use some form of order, as i don't know what it is
[04:37:14] <Cork> callbacks by definition just means inline defined function
[04:37:34] <Cork> "that someone else is calling"
[04:38:57] <fjeessdd> i'm asking about parameters being error first, and error second in callback vs promise
[04:40:16] <Cork> fjeessdd: the order of the arguments depends on the caller, as as you this far haven't given what the caller is, i can't help you
[04:41:18] <fjeessdd> so you think the order is random?
[04:41:33] <Cork> no, i think you need to provide the needed information to answer the question
[04:41:50] <fjeessdd> whats an example of needed information?
[04:42:02] <Cork> what are you giving the callback
[04:42:22] <Cork> what are you giving (function(err,data){}) too?
[04:42:34] <Cork> *to?
[05:02:05] <sonu_nk> s this possibile to get all ajax url using jquery ?
[05:03:08] <Cork> sonu_nk: you mean all ajax called done though jquery?
[05:03:16] <Cork> if so yes, if you want xhr calls too then no
[05:03:52] <sonu_nk> Cork: i am sending lot of ajax call and can see in Browsers console.. but i want to get all the url in a array ..
[05:04:12] <Cork> array would require populating one your self
[05:04:55] <sonu_nk> Cork: i will do array job but i need to check which url is going in ajax call
[05:05:44] <Cork> firstly what version of jquery are you using?
[05:06:45] <Cork> sonu_nk: ah, doesn't matter
[05:06:51] <Cork> sonu_nk: what you need is http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSend/
[05:07:00] <Cork> bind that on the document element
[05:07:23] <Cork> settings.url will be the url used for the call
[05:07:56] <Cork> (you will see it as the example last on that page)
[05:36:17] <sonu_nk> Cork: hi
[05:36:19] <sonu_nk> you there ?
[05:36:33] <Cork> if you have a question just ask it
[05:38:03] <sonu_nk> Cork, i am stuck with my issue.. i builded a analytics tool for my wordpress user.. this tool only limited for my existing user..
[05:38:22] <sonu_nk> with this tool i am tracking existing users history and visits..
[05:38:43] <sonu_nk> now my requirement is this i want to track which file like pdf, doc or ppt they see ...
[05:39:02] <sonu_nk> i am not getting how to do this using javascript or jquery
[05:39:04] <sonu_nk> Cork:
[05:39:09] <Cork> those most likely won't be ajax calls
[05:39:24] <Cork> just straight http calls
[05:39:42] <sonu_nk> Cork: yes you are right.. can we track which file is that and extenstion ?
[05:39:51] <Cork> no
[05:40:02] <Cork> you can catch clicks on <a> tags
[05:40:07] <Cork> but that's about it
[05:40:26] <sonu_nk> yes.. the pdf is rendring using any plugin..
[05:40:33] <Cork> also you will have very limited amount of time to do things there
[05:40:37] <sonu_nk> and that plugin require anchor tag
[05:46:20] <sonu_nk> Cork: http://pastebin.com/zssxZiFJ here i shared my html anchor tag in which pdf is rendering..
[05:46:54] <Cork> sonu_nk: ya, like i said all you can do is have a click handler on it that can do some preprocessing before the call goes away
[05:47:02] <Cork> though note you won't have time for network calls there
[05:48:27] <sonu_nk> Cork: i will track that that this anchor have any pdf url or not.. but wht is this anchor have url and the plugin which will render script is not working ... then how we can say the pdf rendered..
[05:48:31] <sonu_nk> confuse..
[05:48:32] <sonu_nk> Cork:
[05:49:00] <Cork> sonu_nk: like i said before, you can't track that it is rendered
[05:49:07] <Cork> you can only track that the link tag was clicked
[05:49:28] <Cork> cause when the pdf has been fetched your page is unloaded and no js is longer running
[06:30:28] <addiks> hi, does anyone know a good wysiwyg editor (js or jquery) that is made for editing twig-templates?
[07:06:45] <sonu_nk> hi here i am trying to stringfy JSON to my array http://pastebin.com/Y0WLpgU0 but it is blank after conversion .
[07:20:52] <Cork> sonu_nk: cause it isn't after
[07:21:14] <Cork> sonu_nk: ajax is async so the execution order is 1,3,8,9 (later) 4,5
[07:58:25] <lilalinux> Can I change the cursor automatically to "pointer" for all elements with a click event?
[07:58:50] <lilalinux> (and future elements that will be assigned click events)
[08:09:12] <lulul> guys i'm having troubles to loop over an a json response http://notey.it/n/dGli
[08:11:07] <lilalinux> lulul: code looks fine to me
[08:11:51] <lilalinux> lulul: try to setup a fiddle with that code
[08:13:36] <lulul> lilalinux added                 data = $.parseJSON(data);
[08:13:38] <lulul> and it worked =D
[08:14:22] <lilalinux> lulul: lol
[08:14:48] <lilalinux> lulul: dataType: "json"
[08:15:19] <lilalinux> in your ajax request
[08:33:58] <Cork> lulul, lilalinux: actually making sure the server sends the correct content-type is normally the correct fix
[08:37:33] <lilalinux> Cork: Or using SOAP for even more strictness :-)
[08:49:49] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know how to use jEditable( http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable ) on elements that are appended manually to the dom?
[08:55:10] <Knorr> How do I call selectize() on multiple <select> where the <select> are identified by their class and not id?
[08:59:42] <Cork> Knorr: just do $('.the-class').selectize()
[09:00:06] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: you have to run the jeditable() on the element after it's been added
[09:00:36] <KnightsOfNi> Cork, then I need to duplicate code
[09:13:43] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: well you can define a shared function and call it
[10:09:57] <oded> Is there a JQuery selector for looking up the first selector result in parent selector? https://jsfiddle.net/04e4gab9/1/
[10:19:48] <sayhi> oded: you mean each ?
[10:20:33] <oded> sayhi: without each, but nevermind found a way: https://jsfiddle.net/04e4gab9/6/

[10:58:32] <Bent0> ok
[10:58:37] <Bent0> Smells fishy
[11:31:13] <lilalinux> I have a page with tabs using :target selector. How can I make a target the default, if no target is selected (i.e. no #foo in the url)?
[11:51:19] <coihue> Hi people. Question: Want to pass an array from PHP to JS using JQuery's $ajax. Actually, its the bubble that pops up in a leaflet map marker. I cant find a problem similar to that to learn from, can you help me?
[11:51:49] <robertmaxrees> well, break the problem down :)
[11:51:59] <robertmaxrees> you'll use jQuery to make a request to your server for that data.
[11:56:32] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[11:56:36] <plamb__> mr robertmaxrees
[11:56:47] <plamb__> i've got one for ya i'd like to describe before creating a fiddle
[11:56:51] <plamb__> see if i can describe it right
[11:56:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:57:03] <robertmaxrees> you can ask the channel, yo.
[11:57:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm not the only one who can help ;)
[11:57:20] <decx> only one who will tho
[11:57:21] <decx> ^^
[11:57:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:57:32] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[11:57:47] <plamb__> basically on a .change event im trying to populate a JSON object by grabbing the id of an html element as the json attribute and value i calculate as its value
[11:58:13] <plamb__> like this
[11:58:14] <plamb__> http://pastebin.com/fKkkxQ1a
[11:58:36] <robertmaxrees> i'ma make a bot that automatically copies/pastes from pastebin into any other service for me.
[11:58:48] <robertmaxrees>   var menuPriceUpdatesArray = {};
[11:58:50] <plamb__> which do you prefer
[11:58:53] <robertmaxrees> that's an object, not an array.
[11:59:01] <robertmaxrees> none of this is using an array fwow.
[11:59:04] <plamb__> right, well okay first question
[11:59:05] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue here?
[11:59:12] <plamb__> if i want to use KV pairs should i use an object or an array?
[11:59:16] <robertmaxrees> Object.
[11:59:25] <plamb__> okay, so the issue with that one seems to be
[11:59:31] <robertmaxrees> even if you declare an array, you're actually using an objekct still.
[11:59:32] <plamb__> change event occurs, stores as you expect
[11:59:35] <robertmaxrees> and not using the features of the array.
[11:59:47] <plamb__> change event occurs again and it seems to overwrite the previous KV pair with the new one
[11:59:57] <robertmaxrees> because you redeclare the object each time.
[12:00:04] <robertmaxrees> within your handler.
[12:00:12] <plamb__> oh so
[12:00:13] <plamb__> var menuPriceUpdatesArray = {};
[12:00:16] <plamb__> should be global ?
[12:00:17] <robertmaxrees> you need to create an object that holds state that persists outside of the handler.
[12:00:35] <robertmaxrees> maybe no global -try moving it to before the handler.
[12:00:44] <plamb__> lmao, i made that change last night, but didnt delete the local one
[12:00:51] <plamb__> no wonder
[12:00:58] <decx> map all, everytime
[12:01:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:01:11] <robertmaxrees> the smartest thing to do here is to just mapt he values instead.
[12:01:12] <decx> less headaches and easier flow
[12:01:21] <plamb__> what is a mapt ?
[12:01:23] <robertmaxrees> since creating global vars is kind of a no-no.
[12:01:25] <robertmaxrees> *map
[12:01:36] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and we can show you ;)
[12:01:50] <robertmaxrees> also: you sure you want key/value pairs?
[12:02:00] <plamb__> yeah what im doing is
[12:02:19] <plamb__> store the itemid that got clicked and the total price results from the click
[12:02:22] <plamb__> if it gets unclicked
[12:02:32] <plamb__> find that value from the key, and delete it from the total cost
[12:02:39] <robertmaxrees> none of that requires k/v pairs fwiw.
[12:02:43] <plamb__> :(
[12:02:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:02:54] <plamb__> so i need to create a fiddle eh
[12:03:03] <robertmaxrees> lol\
[12:03:11] <robertmaxrees> why do people hate makign test cases so much?
[12:03:14] <robertmaxrees> it's easy.
[12:03:25] <plamb__> lol
[12:03:31] <plamb__> i will in one sec
[12:03:38] <plamb__> i wish this project was my day job
[12:04:40] <plamb__> i feel like in this latest script i've made a bunch of newbie errors
[12:04:44] <plamb__> maybe i should fiddle the whole thing
[12:04:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:04:48] <robertmaxrees> no no no
[12:04:49] <plamb__> :(
[12:04:58] <robertmaxrees> fiddles are for isolated test cases.
[12:05:02] <plamb__> FINE
[12:05:03] <robertmaxrees> not for whole files.
[12:05:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:08:32] <plamb__> so its working the way i wanted it to now
[12:08:38] <plamb__> but here is the idea with the json obj
[12:08:40] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/kkLsv52f/
[12:09:12] <plamb__> err
[12:09:12] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/kkLsv52f/1/
[12:09:39] <decx> right
[12:09:42] <decx> as i wrote
[12:09:46] <decx> map all all the time
[12:09:54] <plamb__> what does that mean lol
[12:10:14] <decx> you map the vals of all your itemids and qty fields and then you reduce it to a sum
[12:10:22] <Uhku> line 2 is a dirty lie!
[12:11:44] <decx> you got inputs as direct children of your ul
[12:11:47] <decx> no
[12:12:16] <anti----psychiat> Fuck psychiatryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[12:12:27] <decx> alright l. ron
[12:12:49] <plamb__> yea decx
[12:12:53] <plamb__> that was a uh
[12:13:03] <plamb__> unfortunate side effect of how i wanted the UI to work
[12:13:11] <decx> well it's wrong
[12:13:23] <anti----psychiat> Fuck all psychiatrists wife's and daughters
[12:13:23] <decx> also why do i have to check the field AND set qty
[12:13:32] <plamb__> you dont in the actual UI
[12:13:36] <plamb__> i just didnt add the CSS
[12:13:38] <decx> just have qty and put your id on there
[12:13:42] <decx> as data
[12:14:00] <decx> <input type="number" data-id="5" data-price="5.5"
[12:14:12] <plamb__> someone was telling me to use data- attributes which im not well aware of
[12:14:19] <anti----psychiat> Fuck all psychiatrists wife's and daughters
[12:14:31] <plamb__> any good beginner tutorial you're aware of
[12:15:15] <decx> it's not rocketscience
[12:15:19] <decx> read the mdn article
[12:15:20] <decx> done
[12:15:31] <robertmaxrees> data-anynamehere="any value here"
[12:15:51] <plamb__> and you call them by $(this).data(name) right?
[12:16:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('anynamehere') yeah
[12:17:38] <plamb__> i gotta fix that inputs thing, its just gonna take so much CSS refactoring
[12:18:03] <plamb__> sucks building something without a design created first
[12:25:10] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:59:00] <plamb__> is it possible to determine if a change event has fired already when its fired
[12:59:11] <plamb__> something like
[12:59:14] <plamb__> if(hasFired)
[12:59:34] <decx> how would that apply to your cart
[12:59:59] <plamb__> so lets say someone adds '1' employee for a cost of '90'
[13:00:04] <plamb__> then decides they want to add 2 instead
[13:00:15] <decx> like i wrote
[13:00:15] <plamb__> i need to delete that 90 from the price before adding 180 back
[13:00:17] <decx> map all
[13:00:19] <decx> reduce sum
[13:01:31] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/96be3osq/
[13:01:59] <plamb__> oh wow i didnt realize jquery had a map function like scala
[13:02:15] <decx> yeah but it doesnt have a reduce
[13:02:29] <decx> that's why we get() to get a real array
[13:04:31] <plamb__> what do (i, e) represent here
[13:04:36] <plamb__> the attributes inside the input ?
[13:04:50] <decx> those are the arguments of the function
[13:05:03] <decx> same as function(i,e) { return }
[13:05:10] <plamb__> where did .dataset come from for example
[13:05:28] <plamb__> do data atttributes have a .dataset method
[13:05:29] <decx> that's just where data attributes are saved on the element
[13:05:38] <decx> it's not a method it's a property
[13:05:57] <decx> couldve been $(e).data('price')
[13:06:12] <plamb__> so e is the <input>
[13:06:17] <plamb__> what is i
[13:06:29] <decx> iterator
[13:06:35] <plamb__> ah
[13:06:37] <decx> 0,1,2,3
[13:06:48] <decx> index
[13:07:03] <plamb__> when you .map a set of html elements is there always an iterator first
[13:07:14] <decx> jquery map is weird like that
[13:07:26] <plamb__> so its always (iterator, elem)
[13:07:26] <decx> in the real map it's element, index
[13:07:57] <decx> well, all methods in jquery use the i, el scheme
[13:08:09] <plamb__> i see
[13:08:38] <plamb__> why do you have to add .trigger('change') at the end
[13:08:52] <decx> to get the $0.00
[13:10:01] <plamb__> oh
[13:10:13] <plamb__> so that fires a change event once before anything else fires it?
[13:10:34] <decx> yeah that just executes the function inside change once
[13:10:52] <plamb__> so it has no effect when people are entering prices later
[13:11:00] <decx> nop
[13:11:29] <plamb__> .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
[13:11:33] <plamb__> is 0 the aggregator here
[13:11:43] <decx> yes
[13:12:24] <plamb__> so instead of "subtracting" from the price, you're resetting it each time
[13:12:50] <decx> yes, doing a fresh start is much easier than keeping track
[13:13:20] <plamb__> wonder if i could implement that over this whole form
[13:13:54] <plamb__> updatePrice would run the map + reduce perhaps
[13:14:14] <decx> there's nothing you can't do with a good reduce
[13:16:05] <taplar> that's what the nazis said
[13:20:54] <plamb__> hmmm
[13:23:58] <plamb__> i think i have to store a global currentPrice
[13:24:20] <plamb__> since there are many more elements to this form that update the price than just that product + price area
[13:25:28] <plamb__> or maybe i could check each time its updated to see if its non zero
[13:29:54] <Chulbul> how can it be js error if method is just defined and not called, where it's being called there is no issue. Where it's not being called, it says e.data('id') is not a method, let me share more details.
[13:30:20] <Chulbul> http://pastebin.com/ZrAzLsuF
[13:30:30] <Chulbul> common.js:183 Uncaught TypeError: e.data is not a function
[13:30:49] <Chulbul> this method is not being called, why this error is happening and how can I prevent it.
[13:32:14] <taplar> ln 7?
[14:02:44] <plamb__> you can call html attributes using dot notation right
[14:02:49] <plamb__> like $(this).id ?
[14:10:56] <plamb__> does jquery have an Optional type
[14:12:26] <arc_> jquery is just a library of methods for modifying jquery objects which are lists of dom elements. it doesn't add any major functionality to javascript. it just makes it easier to deal with dom elements
[14:18:53] <plamb__> does javascript have an Optional type***
[14:19:16] <arc_> i don't know :)
[14:19:32] <taplar> what are you calling an optional type?
[14:19:39] <arc_> googling "javascript type" says no
[14:20:01] <plamb__> like if an inputs value comes back empty
[14:20:13] <plamb__> i can handle what to do in that case easily
[14:20:20] <taplar> that'd just be an empty string
[14:21:15] <plamb__> i can use an .val() in an if conditional though right
[14:21:17] <plamb__> as a boolean value
[14:21:22] <plamb__> if its empty or not
[14:21:38] <taplar> empty string is falsey
[14:22:05] <plamb__> roger
[14:22:06] <Uhku> plamb__: you mean: var x = y || 4?
[14:22:25] <plamb__> i guess "" ||  4
[14:22:59] <Uhku> well in this example y was empty string. yes, that is possible
[14:27:27] <plamb__> decx you still around
[14:37:59] <Chulbul> how to prevent breaking jquery methods if something wrong happens at other jquery method.
[14:48:30] <plamb__> if a selection doesnt select is that falsey?
[14:49:35] <taplar> nope
[14:49:43] <taplar> you have to check its .length
[14:49:50] <plamb__> interdast
[14:49:59] <plamb__> $(this).parent().next('qty').length would be falsey?
[14:50:29] <taplar> if length is 0, yep
[14:50:34] <plamb__> i see
[14:51:33] <plamb__> in a .map((index, elem) => ... )
[14:51:38] <plamb__> is elem already a jquery object
[14:52:00] <taplar> no
[14:52:28] <plamb__> i c
[14:52:33] <taplar> at least not for $.fn.map
[14:58:23] <plamb__> can you not put code blocks inside .map like this?
[14:58:25] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/
[14:59:50] <plamb__> should i be using a .each instead?
[15:03:09] <plamb__> Another important thing to note is that the each function returns the original array while the map function returns a new array. If you overuse the return value of the map function you can potentially waste a lot of memory.
[15:03:12] <plamb__> interdast
[15:03:58] <taplar> each() returns the object it operated upon
[15:04:45] <plamb__> what are your comments on the fiddle
[15:04:53] <plamb__> can i execute code in a .map like i have shown there
[15:06:33] <plamb__> i think it makes more sense for me to use an .each()
[15:06:36] <taplar> you're using an arrow operator so I don't believe 'this' will be what you think it is in that fiddle
[15:06:46] <plamb__> right i think that was the issue
[15:06:59] <taplar> essentially think of it like this
[15:07:11] <taplar> each() is for operating on all the elements, it's an iterator
[15:07:19] <taplar> map() is for translating the elements into something new
[15:07:35] <taplar> what you want to do determines which you want to use
[15:07:48] <plamb__> let me finish this real quick and ill ask you if .each is the right choice
[15:08:37] <plamb__> do i have to .get() a .each to use .reduce
[15:09:35] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/1/
[15:09:51] <taplar> reduce is an array method so yeah, you need a basic Array
[15:10:28] <plamb__> hmm i guess in the case where my Array has only 1 value, reduce doesnt work
[15:10:32] <plamb__> which is what is happening here
[15:10:35] <taplar> $('[data-price]') <-- for performance, don't do that.  stick a class on them or something to select by
[15:10:57] <plamb__> okay
[15:11:59] <taplar> you should also parseInt(hasQtyBox, 10) and use that for your comparisons and evaluations
[15:12:24] <plamb__> roger
[15:13:02] <taplar> in this case I would think map() would be more appropriate than each
[15:13:06] <plamb__> i see
[15:13:15] <plamb__> however
[15:13:21] <taplar> since your wanting to take your elements and get an array of numbers
[15:13:31] <plamb__> it i added that .trigger('change')
[15:13:39] <plamb__> which means my Array will only have 1 element on page load
[15:13:51] <plamb__> will that mess up the reduce
[15:14:04] <taplar> it's often detrimental to readability to one line all your logic, :P
[15:14:46] <taplar> get your elements, store them in a variable.  use that variable to do your map and reduce stuff
[15:14:52] <taplar> then trigger the change on that variable
[15:15:17] <plamb__> when i change it to .map i get an Uncaught SyntaxError
[15:15:19] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/2/
[15:16:33] <taplar> your => doesn't have {} for the logic, which is multi expression
[15:16:38] <plamb__> ahh
[15:16:42] <taplar> you can only leave off the {} if you have just one expression
[15:16:53] <plamb__> this is uncannily similar to scala :)
[15:17:50] <plamb__> so shouldnt the result of UpdatePrice here be '150.00'
[15:17:51] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/3/
[15:18:06] <plamb__> instead of 0
[15:18:18] <plamb__> or is that happening because there is no 2nd element in the array
[15:19:53] <plamb__> in fact its always 0 even with the other change events
[15:20:01] <plamb__> maybe something is wrong with my conditional
[15:20:23] <plamb__> ohh hmm
[15:20:27] <plamb__> maybe i need to parse floats
[15:24:54] <plamb__> thats strange, the map is mapping over the right elems and the conditional is working right
[15:24:59] <plamb__> but its returning an empty array
[15:25:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/4/ <-- looks like your selector isn't finding the qty
[15:27:38] <plamb__> the first input doesnt have a qty box though
[15:27:42] <plamb__> which is why i check for it
[15:28:12] <plamb__> oh so the selector isnt working
[15:30:31] <plamb__> ohh
[15:30:34] <plamb__> hmm
[15:35:13] <plamb__> no idea why that isnt selecting
[15:37:27] <plamb__> apparently i had to do .parent('div')
[15:37:59] <plamb__> bleh still an empty array
[15:39:00] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/5/
[15:39:10] <plamb__> whats returning on that console.log makes no sense to me
[15:39:30] <plamb__> i asked for the parent and its next element, but it returns the html from the parent
[15:40:13] <plamb__> guess ill just use the siblings() selector since that works
[15:46:32] <plamb__> still cant figure out why this array is returning empty
[15:46:33] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/7/
[15:50:12] <MikeD_> i can't figure out what you're asking about
[15:50:35] <plamb__> first question
[15:50:41] <plamb__> if a selector finds nothing
[15:50:49] <plamb__> what is the selectors .length
[15:50:53] <plamb__> 1 or 0
[15:50:55] <MikeD_> 0
[15:52:34] <plamb__> second question
[15:52:35] <MikeD_> parseFloat only has a single parameter
[15:52:50] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/8/
[15:53:02] <plamb__> !hasQtyBox.length should be returning false
[15:53:05] <plamb__> on the initial Run
[15:53:08] <plamb__> but its not
[15:53:42] <plamb__> wait
[15:53:44] <plamb__> maybe i know why
[15:55:35] <plamb__> alright basically back to my initial question
[15:55:48] <plamb__> no idea why the array is returning empty
[15:55:50] <plamb__> https://jsfiddle.net/bnrknk8w/10/
[15:56:20] <plamb__> the conditional accurately finds '150.00' and parses it
[15:56:32] <plamb__> but nothing is returned in the array
[15:59:55] <verax5> so i got a question.. i have some jquery code in my file but i dont want it to execute every tim page loads, for example, I don't want code A to be executed while user is on Page B
[16:02:41] <verax5> so for example, i have ajax in file that makes request to admin page, i dont want it to run even when user just loads home page..
[16:06:23] <plamb__> the answer to my question was
[16:06:29] <plamb__> i have no return statement in the .map
[16:09:38] <taplar> verax5: either don't include the logic on page B so it does not run, or namespace it and put it in a function that you only call on page A
[16:28:50] <verax5> taplar thanks man
[16:29:01] <verax5> i didnt even kknow had namespaces in js
[16:37:26] <duch_kazatel> weeee
[16:38:57] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[16:39:25] <robertmaxrees> whyyyy D:
[16:41:48] <verax5> yooooooooooooooo
[16:41:59] <robertmaxrees> werd
[16:44:55] <rkstyle> hi all
[16:45:00] <rkstyle> someone online here ?
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> lots of people are.
[16:45:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:45:20] <rkstyle> nice i have problem who i cant fix
[16:45:24] <rkstyle> with javascript
[16:45:24] <rkstyle> :(
[16:45:31] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel and somebody will helpo.
[16:45:54] <rkstyle> ok
[16:46:35] <verax5> hey need some help
[16:47:01] <verax5> i just got array of objects
[16:47:10] <verax5> like serveral arrays, inside objects
[16:47:22] <rkstyle> $('#edit_content').keyup(function(e) { $("#send_for_Aj").val($('#edit_content').html()); RepeatElementContent($('#edit_content')) });
[16:47:23] <verax5> i wanna put objects count in an array
[16:47:35] <rkstyle> i wait you verax
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle:  make a jsfiddle instead.
[16:47:47] <robertmaxrees> verax5: you too.
[16:50:01] <z1haze_work> how would i load this with something like getScript()? http://dpaste.com/1Z8JE2D
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work: you wouldn't really be able to.
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet the script looks for those as data attributes.
[16:50:54] <z1haze_work> yea
[16:51:04] <robertmaxrees> so you can't really use getscript.
[16:51:16] <z1haze_work> hmm crap
[16:51:26] <z1haze_work> well since switching to a js framework
[16:51:33] <z1haze_work> the views are loaded after the data
[16:51:39] <z1haze_work> so how would i execute that script then
[16:51:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't directly.  you'd inject that tag.
[16:52:15] <z1haze_work> What do you mean by that? just in the template of my component?
[16:52:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:52:36] <z1haze_work> sec
[16:52:36] <verax5> so... its like ArrayOne[{}], ArrayTwo[{}], ArrayThree[{}]. I'm doing ArrayOne[{}].count to count the objects that are inside it. Then I wanna put them in another array, so new array will have something like, ['ArrayOne'=>1, 'ArrayTwo' => 4]
[16:52:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what framework you're using.
[16:52:47] <robertmaxrees> verax5:  why would you want to do that?
[16:52:49] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/2NSFQYB
[16:52:55] <robertmaxrees> you already have the counts verax5
[16:53:32] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work: yeah so then    you'd inject all of that as markup - otherwise, you'll need to see if that widget has some kind of js api for you do hit instead.
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> *to
[16:54:41] <z1haze_work> what do you mean by inject? this code is on the page
[16:54:42] <rkstyle> Check this: i have div <div id='edit_content' class='edit_readable' contenteditable='true'> </div> and function for replace text but if i try to replace text i have problem with div.... This div focus friest character any rtime
[16:54:51] <z1haze_work> i load this component and it loads the template to the dom
[16:54:57] <verax5> a1hare im passing that to chartjs
[16:54:59] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle: make a jsfiddle yo.
[16:55:06] <verax5> so i just need objects count for each array
[16:55:29] <robertmaxrees> verax5: why does that need to be in a separate object?
[16:55:33] <rkstyle> ok i have question how to get last characters on div element ?
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle: "get last characters"?
[16:55:58] <rkstyle> last char
[16:56:08] <rkstyle> i have string  ="hello"
[16:56:13] <verax5> rober idk thats how its coming from server
[16:56:13] <rkstyle> how to get last charr
[16:56:17] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle:  you can use .text() to get text from an element and then use substr
[16:56:25] <verax5> server is sending multipe objects in an array
[16:56:31] <verax5> [{}], [{}]
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> verax5: ... lol why do you need the counts?
[16:56:49] <rkstyle> oh i will show you my sorce in git
[16:56:51] <verax5> robert i wanna pass that to chartjs
[16:56:54] <verax5> to build a little chart
[16:57:07] <robertmaxrees> verax5:  what format does it need to be in then?
[16:58:20] <verax5> rober lemme show
[16:58:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:03:02] <rkstyle> check this : https://github.com/raichophp/rkstyle.info/issues/2
[17:03:19] <robertmaxrees> not helpful duder
[17:03:56] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle:  so you're just trying to figure out how to focus on a textarea and then put the cursor after the last character?
[17:04:51] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle: if so, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4715762/javascript-move-caret-to-last-character/4716021#4716021
[17:05:00] <verax5> hmm
[17:05:13] <verax5> why cant i call a function from inside anonymous function?
[17:05:20] <robertmaxrees> verax5:  you can
[17:05:36] <robertmaxrees> verax5: just so long as that function is inside the correct scope and you're calling it correctly.
[17:05:57] <verax5> robert i get createC?hart undefined
[17:05:58] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/zyDvCgeH
[17:06:31] <robertmaxrees> then you're running this code before createChart exists
[17:07:30] <verax5> hm strange
[17:07:36] <verax5> createChart is at the top actuallly
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something else wrong/.
[17:08:10] <robertmaxrees> is it defined within another function maybe?
[17:09:24] <rkstyle> robert i have div no textarea
[17:09:37] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/aAa8w0P6
[17:09:43] <rkstyle> this-> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4715762/javascript-move-caret-to-last-character/4716021#4716021 dont fix my problem
[17:09:44] <robertmaxrees> rkstyle:  you can't put the cursor at the end of a div.
[17:09:56] <verax5> its alll defined inside document ready call back robert
[17:10:03] <robertmaxrees> verax5: make a jsfiddle.
[17:10:11] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:10:52] <verax5> well
[17:11:00] <verax5> i took it off from ajax callback and it worked..
[17:11:01] <rkstyle> i cant put cursor at the end of this div <div id='edit_content' class='edit_readable' contenteditable='true'> ??
[17:11:08] <taplar> rkstyle: no
[17:11:22] <taplar> it's not an editable element
[17:11:34] <rkstyle> hm
[17:11:49] <rkstyle> i have to fix mu replace method
[17:12:03] <verax5> taplar any idea how i can call a method from inside ajax success: function({}) callback?
[17:12:30] <taplar> verax5: so long as it is in scope, you can call it
[17:12:54] <verax5> http://pastebin.com/aAa8w0P6
[17:13:09] <verax5> hmm the method im calling is in public scope
[17:13:12] <rkstyle> i looking for method have same effect of this
[17:13:13] <rkstyle> text.textContent.replace(/\b(?:https?|ftp):\/\/[a-z0-9-+&@#\/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[a-z0-9-+&@#\/%=~_|]/gim, '<a href="$&">$&</a>'));
[17:15:44] <verax5> Basically if I put createChart() method inside the success: callback function it says it's undefined, but having it at the top works fine.. http://pastebin.com/E1BUwGtJ
[17:17:15] <taplar> not entirely sure what scope rule is doing that.  you could try putting your function declarations outside of the docready
[17:18:50] <rkstyle> check my ajax post
[17:18:57] <rkstyle> vera5: jQuery.ajax({                    type: "GET",                    url: url_,                                     beforeSend: function(){ 					t = 0; 					$("#loading_txt").replaceWith( "<img id='loader_gif' src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Loading_icon.gif'>" ); 					 $("#loading").css('background-color','transparent'); 	 					$("#timer_counter").html(Timer_); 					 $("#loading").show(); 					           
[17:19:10] <taplar> please don't paste multiline code in the chat
[17:19:22] <rkstyle> sorry
[17:20:08] <andrew9183> i’m waiting for the code to load… all i see is spinning
[17:20:12] <andrew9183> whats the question?  is it still loading
[17:28:25] <mikatone> Hi, having a huge trouble with this code and I can't figure it out here is the problem http://jsbin.com/paginevosu/edit?js,console,output
[17:28:31] <robertmaxrees> back
[17:28:38] <mikatone> *where
[17:29:44] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  are you getting an error or something?
[17:30:13] <mikatone> robertmaxrees nothing the first time I click the button runs fine the second passes the callback...
[17:30:15] <mikatone> I guess
[17:30:33] <mikatone> robertmaxrees pretty complex to debug :(
[17:30:37] <robertmaxrees> you mean the second one doesn't run your callback?
[17:31:01] <taplar> 'answer' is not scoped
[17:31:31] <taplar> once they answer true, it's always true
[17:31:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm really confused about what the problem is supposed to be.
[17:32:04] <tmp381> hi. why button is not changing background color: https://jsfiddle.net/rm3btqt8/
[17:32:23] <mikatone> taplar even you click the first time close = false the second time gets true out of no where
[17:33:34] <robertmaxrees> tmp381: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rm3btqt8/1/
[17:33:46] <robertmaxrees> tmp381: that's why you use jquery event handlers instead of HTML ones.
[17:35:52] <mikatone> robertmaxrees the code is supposed to wait for user decision before "Doing Something" the problem is that the second time you execute the first function (main button) it jumps user decision and it jumps straight to "Doing Something"
[17:36:28] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  you realize that you're not supposed to define handlers within other handlers, right?
[17:36:31] <taplar> mikatone: your Do Something block has a class of 'confirm' on it
[17:36:52] <taplar> which your binding to to close the modal
[17:36:58] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:37:03] <taplar> repeatedly
[17:37:08] <mikatone> robertmaxrees no I don't really
[17:37:15] <robertmaxrees> well now you do :)
[17:37:35] <robertmaxrees> use delegated listeners here and move those bindings out of the confirmaction stuff.
[17:38:46] <mikatone> robertmaxrees sorry can't follow :( I'm not an advanced user man :)
[17:39:07] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:39:21] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:40:07] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: Instead of on() method I'm using post() method and color changes instantly (skipping 'duration' parameter). I'm not able to show it on fiddle :( What could be wrong?
[17:40:28] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  huh?
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  show me a fiddle yo.
[17:40:34] <robertmaxrees> update it.
[17:41:38] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: I'm not able to update it to show you my problem. It doesn't appear on jsfiddle (color is not changing at all).
[17:41:46] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  that's fine.
[17:41:49] <robertmaxrees> i need to see the code to help.
[17:41:57] <tmp381> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rm3btqt8/1/
[17:41:59] <robertmaxrees> without seeing what you're doing, it's hard to offer help.
[17:42:06] <robertmaxrees> you need to update that.
[17:42:58] <mikatone> robertmaxrees so I can't call a function that has handlers from a function that has an handler?
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  you can, but it's a bad idea.
[17:43:27] <mikatone> robertmaxrees so how can i solve it?
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> by using delegated listeners.
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> the pages i linked show you how.
[17:45:16] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: it's something similar to this: https://jsfiddle.net/rm3btqt8/2/
[17:45:43] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  that'll work just fine.
[17:45:48] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  so long as the ajax call is legit.
[17:46:02] <robertmaxrees> put a console log in the callback and make sure it's running.
[17:47:10] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: but my div where I want to change colors is inside file.php. Color is changing, but duration is skipped.
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:48:57] <robertmaxrees> so #Ibg is in the response?
[17:49:22] <mikatone> robertmaxrees I've read it... but not sure how that can solve the problem
[17:49:38] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: yes. 2 divs. outside div has diffrent id and class.
[17:49:59] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  right now you're re-binding those same event listeners over and over.
[17:50:09] <robertmaxrees> taplar:  also provided a hint about a global var.
[17:51:04] <mikatone> robertmaxrees but I don't see it... I mean where is the class confirm in do something block?
[17:52:32] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[17:52:37] <robertmaxrees> it's in the callbacks you're registering.
[17:53:31] <mikatone> robertmaxrees but I'm also removing the object every time the modal get closed ain't the event handlers get removed?
[17:54:34] <mikatone> robertmaxrees this is getting interesting :) really I'm feeling I'm learning something...
[17:56:03] <taplar> last snipplet i looked at you were not remove the object
[17:56:14] <taplar> as i said, the confirm class was on your existing Do Something block
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/1f585948d436 i'd wonder if this works.
[17:57:44] <relipse> i have  $('foo').click() , but how do i make it so that if the user clicks ANYWHERE else besides the 'foo' (turn off a menu)
[17:58:08] <taplar> bind on the body and check that the originalElement was not foo
[17:58:24] <robertmaxrees> original element or an ancestor.
[17:58:35] <taplar> target or originalTarget, i forget the actual property on the event
[17:59:24] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to just use $(this).closest('foo').length
[18:00:07] <taplar> heh, $(document.body).on('click', ':not(.foo)', function(){});
[18:00:14] <mikatone> robertmaxrees no it does not :(
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  does it have the same bug oorrrr...?
[18:00:45] <robertmaxrees> i'm not guaranteeing it's perfect.
[18:00:49] <robertmaxrees> it's just a place to start.
[18:01:55] <mikatone> robertmaxrees sorry it works now
[18:01:57] <mikatone> :D
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:02:11] <Ice_Strike> I have a modal (bootstrap) with a lot of input fields - to put all the fields name in ajax data is time consuming, what is other option?
[18:02:22] <robertmaxrees> serialize it.
[18:02:36] <Ice_Strike> serialize has to be with <form> ?
[18:02:43] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/serialize/ and https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[18:02:50] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: Maybe this is better to understand: https://jsfiddle.net/rm3btqt8/7/
[18:03:57] <mikatone> robertmaxrees so by using Event Delegation directly to $("body").on("click", '.modal-footer .cancel'... it will always be the same event?
[18:04:50] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  read the docs ;)
[18:05:01] <robertmaxrees> mikatone:  they explain what's going on.
[18:05:18] <mikatone> robertmaxrees came on man just a little tea spoon ;)
[18:05:26] <mikatone> of honey
[18:05:28] <robertmaxrees> i gave you the teaspoon.
[18:05:29] <mikatone> :D
[18:05:30] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:05:46] <robertmaxrees> long story short, .on() binds to wahtever element you point it at.
[18:06:12] <robertmaxrees> passing that second arg filters for elements that emitted the event and only triggers the handler when it gets a match
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> bubbling/delegation are pretty neat features that you really do need to read up on in full.
[18:06:30] <robertmaxrees> which is why i tell people to read the docs.
[18:06:51] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  what's an example response?
[18:06:54] <robertmaxrees> just a div?
[18:08:03] <mikatone> robertmaxrees k get that is very deep knowledge... so reading all the https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:08:09] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: not just one div - full html file.
[18:08:17] <mikatone> thank you so much but I still dumb as a rock
[18:08:19] <mikatone> :D
[18:08:54] <mikatone> seriously thank you so much and taplar too
[18:09:30] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  so you're seeing this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rm3btqt8/8/
[18:10:16] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: yes, something like that.
[18:10:19] <robertmaxrees> except you're not using jquery for that append for some reason: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rm3btqt8/9/
[18:10:32] <robertmaxrees> and it's probably because you're adding the new color AND transition at the same time.
[18:10:37] <robertmaxrees> why not have the transition in the css?
[18:12:01] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: transition in the css is not working at all.
[18:14:15] <robertmaxrees> tmp381: yeah this is a quirk with how browsers work.
[18:14:45] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12088819/css-transitions-on-new-elements
[18:31:20] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: Is there anything else you could suggest me? I've seen somewhere working transitions on new DOM elements, so something useful probably exists.
[18:36:14] <robertmaxrees> back
[18:36:27] <robertmaxrees> tmp381:  there are suggestions in that SO page.
[18:37:40] <tmp381> yes, I've tried that, but probably in a wrong way, because this solution is not working for me somehow.
[18:37:46] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[18:38:38] <tmp381> one moment, let me transfer something similar to jsfiddle
[19:19:24] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: I don't know how to trigger this transition duration: https://jsfiddle.net/rm3btqt8/10/
[19:19:45] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:19:48] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:19:53] <robertmaxrees> i sent you material about this laready lol
[19:21:35] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: but I can't get this effect and I don't know why.
[19:21:45] <robertmaxrees> the browser has a race condition.
[19:21:59] <robertmaxrees> the link i gave you explains it and gives you solutions.
[19:23:39] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: I'm doing something wrong and I don't know what is wrong, so it's not working at any time.
[19:23:49] <robertmaxrees> so then read the stack overflow link.
[19:24:41] <tmp381> robertmaxrees: I know that I have to request property that requires layout. I try to do it and it's not working for me.
[19:24:47] <robertmaxrees> show me then.
[19:25:16] <robertmaxrees> because that works totally fine for me.
[19:26:09] <robertmaxrees> also: get the transition into your css.
[19:26:13] <robertmaxrees> stop trying to add it using .css()
[19:26:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rm3btqt8/17/ like this
[19:33:08] <tmp381> and now it's working (and IDK why it wasn't working before). thank you :)
[22:16:13] <plamb> if you add two floats do you get back an int?
[22:16:40] <plamb> nm
[22:19:40] <plamb> is possible to just apply a change event handler to a whole page
