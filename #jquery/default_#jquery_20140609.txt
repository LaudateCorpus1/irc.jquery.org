[00:26:45] <LEU> can i modify jQuery UI css for menu function ?
[00:29:16] <LEU> .menu() i mean
[00:36:49] <Cork> LEU: sure why wouldn't you be?
[00:54:58] <arjun024> Hey, is there anyway for a deferred promise, in which the always() callback will be fired - but neither the done() nor the fail() callback will be fired.
[01:00:41] <Cork> arjun024: no
[01:00:59] <Cork> arjun024: you can construct objects with more then two callbacks if you like though
[01:02:07] <arjun024> @Cork: x={done:function(){return x},fail:function(){return x},always:(function(){})()};
[01:02:18] <arjun024> i try something like this
[01:02:36] <arjun024> but "always" comes up in the output as "aLways"
[01:02:41] <arjun024> capital "L"
[01:03:01] <Cork> uh
[01:03:22] <Cork> arjun024: that wasn't exactly what i meant
[01:03:52] <Cork> you can create a $.Deferred object and then attach an additional callback with $.Callbacks()
[01:04:03] <Cork> ?jquery.callbacks
[01:05:12] <arjun024> @Cork. can that stop the done() and fail from executing?
[01:05:18] <sledgeDJ> hey guys i have this... http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/6464/ i want to change it so that the text is displayed when unchecked not checked. what is the best way to do this?
[01:06:04] <Cork> arjun024: done and fail executes when the resolve or reject is called
[01:07:38] <sledgeDJ> hey guys i have this... http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/6466/ i want to change it so that the text is displayed when unchecked not checked. what is the best way to do this?
[01:07:41] <sledgeDJ> just updated it
[01:08:06] <sledgeDJ> by defualt checkbox should be checked and text hidden on uncheck text should be displayed
[01:08:10] <sledgeDJ> any ideas?
[01:12:56] <Cork> sledgeDJ: http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/6467/
[01:13:07] <Cork> sledgeDJ: no need for js to do that
[01:13:23] <sledgeDJ> ah i see
[01:13:48] <sledgeDJ> will this css work in all browsers?
[01:13:59] <Cork> except really old ie
[01:14:06] <Cork> (ie 5.5)
[01:14:21] <sledgeDJ> ok
[01:14:37] <sledgeDJ> thanks
[01:14:41] <Cork> but most anything is broken in ie 5.5 :)
[01:14:48] <Cork> np
[01:21:41] <sledgeDJ> Cork: it is not working
[01:21:58] <sledgeDJ> let me modify my jsfiddle to be more accurate
[01:22:37] <Cork> sledgeDJ: the css only works if the div is directly after the checkbox
[01:22:54] <Cork> you need to modify it if it isn't
[01:23:09] <sledgeDJ> ahhh
[01:23:13] <sledgeDJ> it is not the next div
[01:23:18] <sledgeDJ> it is a few div later
[01:23:26] <sledgeDJ> how do i need to modify it?
[01:23:34] <Cork> change :checked + to :checked + * +
[01:23:48] <Cork> hmm actaully
[01:24:01] <Cork> you need + * for every element inbetween
[01:24:18] <sledgeDJ> cork: i am thinking jquery might be the better solution then css?
[01:24:32] <Cork> sledgeDJ: not the better, but it might be your only choice
[01:24:45] <sledgeDJ> so can u help me modify the jquery?
[01:25:30] <arjun024> thanks @Cork anyway
[01:25:35] <sledgeDJ> http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/6466/ by defualt it tshould be checked and text chould be hidden when check is unchecked the text appears
[01:26:04] <Cork> sledgeDJ: http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/6468/
[01:26:16] <sledgeDJ> yes cork thanks for trying the css method and now thanks for the jquery
[01:26:19] <sledgeDJ> let me check it....
[01:26:58] <sledgeDJ>  by defualt it tshould be checked and text chould be hidden when check is unchecked the text appears
[01:27:27] <sledgeDJ> you almost got it
[01:27:27] <Cork> ya, and that is what it does
[01:27:56] <LEU> aa
[01:28:03] <Cork> bb
[01:28:08] <sledgeDJ> no by defualt it is checked and text is showing
[01:28:17] <sledgeDJ> text needs to ot be showing until unchecked
[01:28:26] <sledgeDJ> text needs to not be showing until unchecked
[01:28:33] <Cork> so the checkbox shouldn't be checked by default?
[01:28:52] <sledgeDJ> it should be checked by defualt
[01:28:57] <Cork> uh...
[01:29:03] <sledgeDJ> but text should be hidden until the box is unchecked
[01:29:08] <Cork> ah
[01:29:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/5udtC/6469/
[01:34:46] <sledgeDJ> Cork: works great but i need a slight modification
[01:36:31] <abishek> I use this code http://jsbin.com/bepoxoqu/4/edit to blink a particular text on my page, Is there a way to stop the blinking effect?
[01:37:48] <Cork> abishek: what is the browsers you need to support?
[01:37:58] <Cork> is css3 dependency ok?
[01:38:12] <abishek> yes
[01:38:27] <Cork> then you can use keyframe and animate instead
[01:38:58] <sledgeDJ> sometimes the page might reload with the checkbox unchecked in these situations it needs to know and needs to display the text accordingly
[01:39:13] <sledgeDJ> Cork: do you understand my issue?
[01:41:03] <sledgeDJ> or does anyone?
[01:41:35] <abishek> Cork, I have no expereience with the keyframe, which is why I went with jquery
[01:43:13] <sledgeDJ> what is am thinking it should be is something more like this....  if checkbox is checked make div hidden else make unhidden
[01:43:17] <sledgeDJ> what do you think?
[01:48:00] <Cork> abishek: http://jsfiddle.net/fsw4D/
[01:48:40] <Cork> sledgeDJ: you need to run the toggle code on page ready
[01:49:17] <Cork> sledgeDJ: this is exactly why the css code is nicer, cause that makes it just work :)
[01:49:37] <sledgeDJ> can u please modify the jquery to make it do this?
[01:50:00] <Cork> sledgeDJ: no you would have to understand the code and modify it
[01:50:06] <Cork> i'm not here to write your code for you
[01:50:12] <sledgeDJ> ok let me try
[01:50:14] <sledgeDJ> thanks
[01:50:34] <Cork> np
[02:07:54] <abishek> Cork, thanks, Appreciate your help
[02:16:07] <ledestin> I have a reproducible bug in IE7 and jQueryUI. Before I submit it to the bugzilla, would anyone like to look at it to make sure it’s ok?
[02:16:47] <Cork> ledestin: make a jsfiddle and ppl might chimm in :)
[02:17:23] <ledestin> Cork: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/87810751/jqueryui/datepicker.html not possible to do jsfiddle with IE7
[02:20:07] <Cork> oh lovely my ie7 machine is bsoding...
[02:46:36] <emx_> what is the use of this call? $( function() { .. } );?
[02:47:10] <Cork> emx_: a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {})
[02:47:21] <emx_> Cork, k, thanks
[03:23:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does find() search 1 level deep or as deep as possible?
[03:24:05] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: it searches in the tree
[03:24:15] <Cork> children() does the child check
[03:24:31] <Cork> *child search
[03:25:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but you have <div><span><a id="x"> - you have the div in a var, then do div.find("#x")
[03:25:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> will it find it?
[03:26:17] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: ids is always unique so you just do $('#x')
[03:26:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well ok, a class name then
[03:26:37] <Cork> but yes for classes or similar selectors it is correct
[03:26:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok ty
[03:35:58] <tesefd> Can anyone take a look at this jquery and give me a hint as to where im going wrong? . Trying to post a form as json but getting content type error : http://jsbin.com/pujuhuve/1/edit thankyou for any help
[03:36:49] <Cork> tesefd: why are you binding a submit event in a click event?
[03:37:07] <Cork> tesefd: also your doing cross domain ajax
[03:37:19] <Cork> make sure the server you try to talk to allows that
[03:38:34] <tesefd> Unsure of which method i should be using, originally tried a on document load but it submitted empty fields
[03:39:05] <Cork> tesefd: your example is missing the html so ya hard to tell what it is your trying to do
[03:39:16] <tesefd> 2 seconds ill throw up the html my bad
[03:39:54] <silverdust> how can I take off an attribute and its values from a selected element
[03:40:10] <Cork> take off?
[03:40:21] <Cork> you mean you want to remove the attribute?
[03:40:30] <silverdust> <a href="#" class="bar"></a>
[03:40:32] <silverdust> yea
[03:40:37] <Cork> and you want to remove what?
[03:40:45] <silverdust> I want to remove class="bar"
[03:40:53] <Cork> ?removeClass
[03:40:55] <silverdust> so it becomes <a href="#"></a>
[03:41:04] <Cork> just do .removeClass('bar')
[03:41:12] <tesefd> Here is the html and associated ajax.js file http://jsbin.com/hilelira/1/edit thanks again Cork much appreciated
[03:41:14] <silverdust> ok thanks
[03:42:38] <Cork> tesefd: http://jsbin.com/hilelira/2/edit that might work
[03:43:00] <Cork> tesefd: as your saying to send json and not params you will have to construct the json object you want
[03:43:28] <Cork> so that part is most likely wrong
[03:48:50] <tesefd> Cork: { "message" : "Unexpected Content-Type 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', expecting 'application/json'."} is still coming back. New to all this so just a bit confused on it all
[03:49:15] <Cork> tesefd: the server expects you to send json not param strings
[03:49:47] <Cork> that means you need to construct a json object and JSON.stringify() the object
[03:57:35] <dave_2> i'm having a weird issue here http://budgettraveldeals.co.uk/ on right hand side form when i press enter on any input field the Add Return Button toggles, that should not happen until button is clicked but it happend even if i press enter on input field there
[03:58:49] <Cork> dave_2: you mean the quota_me button?
[03:59:12] <dave_2> nopes Add Return Button
[04:00:01] <Cork> dave_2: well the default type for <button> is type="submit"
[04:00:21] <Cork> and all elements in a form except textarea will fire a submit event on the form on enter
[04:00:49] <dave_2> oh how can i forget that thanks man Cork
[04:01:00] <paulvd> jcarousel can be used to make a custom text slide ?
[04:01:10] <Cork> dave_2: if you don't want a button to be a submit button give it type="button"
[04:07:35] <paulvd> no one?
[04:08:29] <Sal> whats the best plugin that can handle touch and mouse events at the same time?
[04:08:59] <Cork> paulvd: try and see
[04:09:11] <Cork> Sal: that question is too generic
[04:09:25] <Cork> Sal: jquery can handle touch and mouse events at the same time
[04:09:32] <Cork> in some situations
[04:09:39] <paulvd> Cork I did :S
[04:09:41] <silverdust> a .fadeOut() gives an element a display:none; what's different about a .empty() ?
[04:09:49] <Sal> i just need to click and drang a left hidden panel, or tap and swipe it
[04:09:56] <paulvd> dunno whats wrong with this jsfiddle
[04:10:00] <paulvd> not opening here
[04:10:00] <Cork> in some situations you want to make special actions to make it behave in sertan ways
[04:10:11] <Sal> Cork, without using jquery mobile?
[04:10:16] <Cork> Sal: sure
[04:10:23] <Cork> swipe is another matter though
[04:10:25] <Sal> wow!didn't know that
[04:10:34] <Cork> Sal: it is a standard dom event
[04:10:41] <silverdust> Cork: how is a .fadeOut() different from a .empty() without the animation?
[04:10:46] <Cork> you have touchstart/touchmove/touchend
[04:10:53] <Sal> great!
[04:11:03] <Cork> silverdust: fadeOut doesn't change the content of the element
[04:11:17] <Cork> it just animates opacity from 1 to 0
[04:11:37] <silverdust> what if I want to fadeOut and empty
[04:11:51] <Sal> Cork, but how should i handle both? i mean, how can i know if the page is running on device or on desktop
[04:11:53] <silverdust> can I do a .fadeOut().empty()
[04:12:30] <Cork> Sal: .on('click touchstart', function() {})
[04:12:45] <Sal> wow!
[04:12:48] <Cork> silverdust: no that would empty the element before the animation starts
[04:13:03] <Sal> thanks
[04:13:10] <Cork> silverdust: .fadeOut(function() { $(this).empty(); });
[04:13:52] <silverdust> ok thanks
[04:14:33] <silverdust> what if I want to wrap the target element in maybe a template element on click
[04:15:10] <Cork> silverdust: you should be careful with wrapping and unwrapping elements
[04:15:25] <Cork> it can create a lot of problems in the code
[04:15:30] <Cork> and most of the time you don't need to
[04:15:38] <silverdust> ok
[04:15:45] <Cork> silverdust: but there is a .wrap() function
[04:15:55] <silverdust> Let me explain the scenario I'm having with you
[04:16:08] <silverdust> or I'll drop a fiddle
[04:19:19] <DelphiWorld> hi jQueryifiers
[04:19:21] <DelphiWorld> question
[04:19:36] <DelphiWorld> how to include latest jquery & jquery mobile without specifying the version?
[04:21:03] <Hypfer> hi, I embed an svg with jquery .append now I need to change some text in that svg with jquery. How do I do that?
[04:21:04] <Cork> DelphiWorld: jquery has http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[04:21:09] <Cork> not sure there is one for jqm
[04:21:29] <DelphiWorld> Cork: then what's jquery.main.js?
[04:21:29] <papifabi> Hypfer> perhaps better use raphael.js ?
[04:21:33] <Cork> Hypfer: as long as the elements has the correct namespace it should work fine
[04:21:42] <Cork> DelphiWorld: main?? never heard of it
[04:21:51] <Hypfer> Cork: correct namespace *scatches head*
[04:22:00] <Hypfer> papifabi: I don't want more dependencies :/
[04:22:08] <papifabi> ho okay
[04:22:10] <DelphiWorld> Cork: stupid me, min
[04:22:19] <Cork> DelphiWorld: the min is the minified version
[04:22:30] <DelphiWorld> Cork: oh dude, thank
[04:22:48] <papifabi> i try use selenium with svg,it is possible?
[04:22:53] <papifabi> animated svg
[04:22:58] <Hypfer> its embedded with <img src="font/thermo.svg" id="thermometer">
[04:23:03] <Hypfer> so not directly into the html
[04:23:09] <Hypfer> is that a problem?
[04:23:09] <Cork> ah
[04:23:12] <Cork> ya
[04:23:25] <Cork> Hypfer: 1. that is svg-as-image
[04:23:32] <Cork> it doesn't have an accessable dom
[04:23:37] <Hypfer> meh
[04:23:41] <Hypfer> what do I do about that?
[04:23:49] <Cork> 2. if you loaded it in an iframe you might be able to do it
[04:24:01] <Cork> if it is from the same domain
[04:24:11] <silverdust> Cork: this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/4dEeN/
[04:24:18] <Hypfer> the alternative to an iframe is directly including it?
[04:24:21] <Cork> Hypfer: you most likely want to either animate it from inside the svg, or embed it in the page
[04:24:28] <silverdust> I get staff INformation page on click
[04:24:29] <paulvd> Cork > http://jsfiddle.net/VQYD4/7/
[04:24:36] <Cork> Hypfer: yes
[04:24:49] <silverdust> but I want to get back company information page when I click company information
[04:25:05] <silverdust> I've been trying various means
[04:25:09] <Hypfer> Cork: as an object? what is the correct way of embedding for my use case?
[04:25:22] <Cork> Hypfer: <svg></svg>
[04:25:34] <Hypfer> wow
[04:25:36] <Hypfer> simple.
[04:25:49] <Cork> Hypfer: it only works in fairly new browsers
[04:26:12] <Hypfer> Cork: it's more or less an mebedded system with chrome 35
[04:26:16] <Hypfer> should work I guess
[04:26:40] <Cork> silverdust: append(template.html()) <-- you really shouldn't do this
[04:26:43] <Cork> use .clone()
[04:27:30] <Cork> silverdust: also replace append with .html()
[04:27:31] <krez> hello.
[04:27:39] <Cork> then you can skip the empty() call
[04:27:55] <newby> i'm trying to do something simple with jquery
[04:27:58] <silverdust> .html(template.clone()) ?
[04:28:15] <newby> which is have two select forms A and B and change B's values accordinly based on A's value
[04:28:19] <Cork> silverdust: yes
[04:28:22] <newby> can anyone suggest a simple way to do this
[04:28:45] <newby> :D?
[04:29:02] <paulvd> jcarousel does not work with text ? > http://jsfiddle.net/VQYD4/8/
[04:29:39] <silverdust> Cork that didn't give me expected result http://jsfiddle.net/4dEeN/1/
[04:29:49] <newby> anyone?
[04:30:35] <newby> :(
[04:30:49] <DelphiWorld> Cork: can you imagine a blind guy writing js? :P
[04:30:59] <Hypfer> Cork: made a fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/X6ZQ8/ <-- how do I edit that "HI" and "LO" ?
[04:31:07] <iDevelop> It wouldn't be that hard
[04:31:12] <iDevelop> If I was blind
[04:31:16] <iDevelop> and someone told me the div names
[04:31:21] <Cork> newby: something like var fields = $('#a').serializeArray(), formB = $('#b'); $.each(fields, function(elm) { form.find('[name="' + elm.name ' '"]').val(elm.value); });
[04:31:23] <Cork> should work
[04:31:25] <iDevelop> I could easilly write jquery
[04:31:31] <Cork> DelphiWorld: sure
[04:31:32] <iDevelop> easily*
[04:31:35] <DelphiWorld> Cork: it's me:)
[04:32:06] <DelphiWorld> Cork: i'm pretty surprised now
[04:32:14] <newby> what does this do?
[04:32:43] <DelphiWorld> i wish everyone respect accessibility marking ;(
[04:32:58] <Cork> Hypfer: http://jsfiddle.net/X6ZQ8/1/
[04:33:28] <Cork> newby: it collects all the fields from the first form, then loops the array and finds the corresponding elements in the second form
[04:33:35] <Cork> and sets it to the value from the first
[04:33:44] <Hypfer> wow. simple
[04:33:50] <Hypfer> thank you very much, Cork :)
[04:33:51] <Cork> newby: you could also make it do this as a live change event
[04:34:19] <DelphiWorld> Cork: may you help with a jquery audio player please? its not playing maybe jquery version conflict?
[04:34:42] <Cork> DelphiWorld: i guess it is a plugin?
[04:34:50] <Cork> never seen it so not sure
[04:35:04] <DelphiWorld> Cork: yes, its  a jquery plugin, i prefer using jplayer
[04:35:11] <DelphiWorld> Cork: want to see my page?
[04:35:23] <Cork> DelphiWorld: i could try, but no guarantees
[04:35:39] <DelphiWorld> Cork: sure, nothing guarenty:P
[04:35:44] <DelphiWorld> Cork: see pm for url;)
[04:36:04] <Cork> try again (i have pm disabled normally)
[04:37:40] <DelphiWorld> lol
[04:37:55] <DelphiWorld> Cork: the latest version of jquery & jquery mobile make me pretty happyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[04:38:06] <DelphiWorld> the accessibility its very very very respected there
[04:42:08] <silverdust> Cork: please can you help me modify my code http://jsfiddle.net/4dEeN/1/
[04:42:24] <silverdust> and I don't think clone is the best for what I was doing there
[04:42:46] <DelphiWorld> Cork, player work perfectly in mobile, but when i change the stream its play them both :P
[04:42:58] <DelphiWorld> that's the only issue i have for now
[04:43:05] <silverdust> It's cloning the anchor I'd clicked into the page rather than appending the page container with the template element I want
[04:58:25] <DelphiWorld> Cork: nevermind please, all is workig
[04:58:30] <DelphiWorld> Cork: nevermind please, all is working
[04:58:38] <DelphiWorld> anyone recomand a good RSS reader?
[04:58:43] <DelphiWorld> plugin for jq
[05:01:00] <Cork> DelphiWorld: you will most likely have problems there
[05:01:17] <DelphiWorld> Cork: anyway, the page is working :P
[05:01:23] <Cork> DelphiWorld: rss is normally not configured with cors so you can't fetch them from js
[05:01:37] <DelphiWorld> Cork: i got plugins:P
[05:27:38] <Wobbo> I am looking for a tool to retrieve. All not necessary spaces and carriage returns out in HTML, JavaScripts and CSS. Alle for a smartphone site. As with jQuery min stuff. Any tips?
[05:37:18] <MikeD_> Wobbo: huh?
[05:38:38] <MikeD_> I'm trying to debug code inside an embedded IE10, is there a way to programmatically pop the debugging tools?  I can't get to console
[05:46:37] <EllBee> So I've been running into a bit of a strange issue I haven't been able to handle without a bit of unwanted user-side script.  For Chrome/Safari, sometimes when the user clicks the back button, information is queried, but the browser decides to instead load cached form data
[05:47:25] <Cork> EllBee: most likely not cached, but old user entries
[05:47:32] <EllBee> Assuming it has something to do with Webkit vs whatever IE/Firefox uses
[05:47:37] <Cork> EllBee: set autocomplete="off" on the element
[05:50:07] * DelphiWorld is back
[05:50:12] <DelphiWorld> Cork: display problem again ;(
[05:50:52] <Cork> DelphiWorld: ugg i just remembered the link you sent >_<
[05:51:04] <Cork> (sorry got busy)
[05:51:18] <DelphiWorld> lol Cork
[05:51:33] <DelphiWorld> just sended it again :)
[05:51:39] <DelphiWorld> click news and see :P
[05:51:51] <DelphiWorld> lol, tts read it but users dont see it
[05:51:56] <Cork> DelphiWorld: ya i got it last time
[05:52:03] <Cork> just never looked at it >_<'
[05:52:22] <Cork> anyway what is the problem?
[05:53:01] <Cork> btw <a href="#player"data-role="button" data-rel="dialog" data-transition="pop"> <--
[05:53:10] <Cork> href="#player"data-role="button" should be href="#player" data-role="button"
[05:55:17] <DelphiWorld> ADSL
[05:55:22] <DelphiWorld> ODD enough
[05:55:50] <DelphiWorld> shitty ADSL
[05:56:03] <Cork> http://irc.jquery.com <-- loggs
[06:02:02] <DelphiWorld> back...
[06:03:21] <DelphiWorld> <p><a href="#player"data-role="button" data-rel="dialog" data-transition="pop">Radio Player</a></p>
[06:03:30] <DelphiWorld> guys, how do i add  a img to this link?
[06:04:42] <DelphiWorld> if using JQM
[06:04:54] <DelphiWorld> its pocible to add a particular js script to a particular page?
[06:28:19] <paulvd> anyone here knows how to center the active div in jquery cycle, by default it makes the first div active ?
[06:37:49] <DelphiWorld> how to put a image in header, but in center?
[06:46:40] <paulvd> is there any carousel which can show 3 items in view and make the center item as the avtive one ?
[06:46:45] <paulvd> active*
[06:47:20] <DelphiWorld> paulvd: do you know how to centralise a img?
[06:47:54] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: It depends on your markup.
[06:48:15] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: wanna see my code?
[06:48:19] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: But one easy thing you could try is to add text-align: center to the header
[06:48:43] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: a second please
[06:48:44] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: The best is to use a live pastebin… like jsfiddle
[06:49:01] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: they are not good for blind people ;)
[06:51:04] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: i try them everyday hoping they respect accessibility markup but no luck
[06:53:30] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: Ah :/ I'm a bit selfish I guess… I'm not blind and I don't really care if a dev-oriented website doesn't work for blind people.
[06:53:56] <systemfault> I wonder how many blind webdevs there are.
[06:54:19] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: ok, so you dont want to make your web site screen reader's awar
[06:55:19] <systemfault> My website, sure.
[06:55:31] <DelphiWorld> lol
[06:55:35] <systemfault> I just don't mind for "jsfiddle" as far as I'm concerned.
[06:56:54] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: hold on let me pb
[07:00:12] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: here you go: http://dpaste.com/2FQSE9P/
[07:01:16] <systemfault> DelphiWorld: Too bad it's not a live pastebin… But where is the img you want to center?
[07:01:51] <DelphiWorld> systemfault: the header one, also the css markup for background is not taking effect, while past you the live link in pm
[07:18:25] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[07:21:42] <Basile_S> Hello, I am Basile Starynkevitch. I can't easily find the jquery syntax to select from a given javascript thing.
[07:22:14] <Cork> "given javascript thing"?? :D
[07:22:18] <Mateo_> I still have a problem with a custom select (with filter) with jQuery Mobile. Whenever I choose a value in the dropdown list, I’m redirected to the #home page
[07:22:19] <Mateo_> http://jsfiddle.net/Bme9n/2/
[07:22:23] <Cork> you think you could be a little bit more specific?
[07:22:30] <Basile_S> To be precise, I'm coding (in Javascript) var elemdiv=$('#elemid'); then, I call a function: somefunction(elemdiv);
[07:22:48] <Basile_S> then I need to get the element of class attrlist_cl in it.
[07:23:12] <Cork> so you want to find a child element to elemdiv with that class?
[07:23:16] <Basile_S> elemdiv.$('.attrlist_cl') does not work.
[07:23:21] <Basile_S> @Cork. Yes.
[07:23:26] <Cork> elemdiv.find('.attrlist_cl')
[07:23:37] <Basile_S> Thanks!
[07:23:41] <Cork> np
[07:24:50] <Mateo_> I used the example here :demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/selectmenu-custom-filter/#&ui-state=dialog
[07:25:02] <Mateo_> sorry :/   here : http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/selectmenu-custom-filter/
[07:34:46] <BillCriswell> Kind of want lunch already.
[07:41:40] <Mateo_> If you have any tips to debug that, I’d be glad to read it :)
[07:44:29] <Mateo_> I’ve tried to add a log in the “.on( "pagebeforeshow pagehide", …” part, but it’s not even firing
[07:48:50] <bigjimmi> Hi, is this a good place for plugin writing help?
[07:50:15] <bigjimmi> I’ve wrote a plugin based on the jquery plugin boilerplate but want to be able to call it by $.mypluginname ratehr than $(#body).mypluginname - can anyone help?
[07:51:04] <danols> Any gurus are willing to help me out with http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/examples/
[07:51:18] <danols> I can't wrap my head around it and actually make the code usable
[07:51:32] <danols> It's using promises to have a generic cache mechanism
[07:53:44] <bigjimmi> Can anyone here help with with a pluging writing question? Thanks
[08:05:43] <Mateo_> Hmm that’s pretty annoying. The value is selected, but I’m still redirected to the main page
[08:06:26] <Mateo_> And best of all, I can’t scroll in the listView :)
[08:12:36] <cjldn> hello there, I've built a form where, depending on the checkboxes selected, 1 div is displayed amongst 3 possible. I've used hide() and show() functions to achieve it, however now I need to save the times every single div is displayed. My question is, to achieve this and save the value of these 3 counters, I need to save it on a DB, isn't it? Thanks in
[08:12:36] <cjldn> advance :)
[08:13:32] <paulvd> jcarousel, cannot make a carousel with text in it ?
[08:20:03] <skinux> How do we use jquery.form.js?
[08:25:36] <MikeD_> how do i return the classname of a jquery dom reference?
[08:29:35] <decx> natively with .classList
[08:30:28] <decx> so i guess .prop('classList')
[08:36:07] <skinux> Is jQuery Minimal just a cut-down version of jQuery code or actually written differently?
[08:36:49] <systemfault> Never heard of it :/
[08:37:09] <thebope> skinux, it's minified
[08:37:17] <thebope> that means variable names like alpha become a
[08:37:21] <thebope> all spacing is removed
[08:37:31] <thebope> Sometimes it gets gzipped for further minification
[08:38:16] <thebope> this reduces the load on the server when it has to serve jquery to millions of consumers (clients). This technique also cna be used for obfuscation of proprietary code
[08:38:24] <thebope> and it reduces the load time client side as well
[08:39:36] <emx> which event is triggered when a user hits the cancel button of a file selection box?
[08:39:58] <thebope> I don't think any event
[08:40:12] <thebope> although I'm sure you could link it to something
[08:44:38] <jessica563> am i correct syntax pls $('#new-comments-notification > ul > li > a > span:contains()
[08:45:11] <jessica563> trying to get the span inside of the a tag
[08:45:27] <thebope> Does it work?
[08:45:33] <thebope> You can try it in the console if you want
[08:46:04] <thebope> To access console in Chrome I press F12 to access the developer tools
[08:46:22] <thebope> Your syntax looks okay but it's a long chain which can be easily broken by future modifications to the page
[08:46:39] <thebope> You might want to add an id or class to the span, or to the anchor element above it
[08:46:51] <thebope> so that the chain of elements isn't so long
[08:47:43] <jessica563> ok ty everyone
[08:47:57] <jessica563> thebope:  *
[08:48:06] <thebope> no problem
[08:48:08] <skinux> thebope: Minified as in function names are changed to being only a character or two?
[08:48:09] <thebope> Did that help?
[08:48:29] <thebope> skinux, Everything about the file is made as small as possible
[08:48:46] <thebope> Function names and variable names are one or two characters. Yea I mean that pretty much covers it
[08:49:27] <skinux> So, jquery.min.js is more for browsers to use, not developers?
[08:49:42] <thebope> skinux, you can perform the process here http://jscompress.com/ and see some of the libraries they use in the paragraph at the bottom
[08:49:44] <thebope> exactly
[08:50:17] <thebope> It really sucks debugging minified code because it says "this error happened on line one" and then you realize the whole program is on line one
[08:50:35] <skinux> So, when I see scripts with a bunch of 'j, o, y, s' type shit, it's been minified??
[08:51:12] <thebope> Most likely
[08:51:31] <thebope> or obfuscated. Theres probably a few libraries offering the functionality which do it slightly differently too
[08:51:38] <thebope> it seems like uglify is the big one
[08:52:21] <skinux> I'm just trying to validate a web form.
[08:52:40] <thebope> If its valid code after being minified it should still be valid
[08:53:01] <jParkton> troth
[08:53:09] <thebope> http://jsbeautifier.org/
[08:53:19] <thebope> This page promised to beautify, unpack, or deobfuscate code skinux
[08:53:26] <thebope> maybe you can toss your script in there
[08:53:34] <arnab_> hi, i am trying to log into mw api using jquery. But seems some issue. Could any1 help .https://forum.jquery.com/topic/handling-cookies-with-jquery
[08:53:40] <skinux> Yeah, I know about that.
[08:54:18] <jorvis> General topic here, but if you guys/girls are writing a web app focused around data display (like stock trading apps) how wide is reasonable to set as a min width?
[08:55:14] <jParkton> why set min width?
[08:55:19] <jParkton> media queries?
[08:55:21] <thebope> jorvis, doesn't it depend on what you're aiming for? How much information you have to display? The browsers and devices you're targeting? I like using the golden ratio when I design
[08:55:29] <thebope> But thats just me
[08:55:32] <jParkton> nerd
[08:55:36] <thebope> hahaha
[08:55:44] <jorvis> Here's the page under development: http://gear.igs.umaryland.edu
[08:55:45] <jParkton> great reference though
[08:56:12] <jorvis> I need to try to arrange that to have as much visible as possible without scrolling
[08:56:13] <thebope> those are some sweet pictures jorvis
[08:56:17] <jParkton> jorvis: are you targeting mobile or desktop?
[08:56:22] <jorvis> Purely desktop
[08:56:23] <thebope> thanks jParkton
[08:56:46] <jorvis> thebope: thanks, just SVGs that I'll be coloring with javascript depending on which gene the user clicks on
[08:56:58] <thebope> jorvis, http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp
[08:57:09] <thebope> Those are the stats on browser display recently
[08:57:22] <thebope> Yea that's really cool stuff. I wish I knew more
[08:57:35] <thebope> It's a start but you can see the displays are spread pretty evenly
[08:57:35] <jorvis> Wow, interesting.  So 78% of users currently have at least 1366 on the horizontal.
[08:57:45] <thebope> Thats the much better draw from that data
[08:58:18] <systemfault> jorvis: I might be the exception but I never maximize my browser. I usually make it take half of the screen.
[08:58:30] <arnab_> Could any of you guys check, if I am doing anything wrong here with the post method? http://plnkr.co/edit/KR138w3U4PczELEA6JlG?p=preview
[08:58:59] <jorvis> systemfault:  Me too, but this is a data driven application for hearing loss researchers.  While they're using it to look up their data they often will increase it quite a bit, if not maximize it on one screen.
[08:59:59] <jorvis> systemfault: 2 of my monitors I develop on are actual vertically mounted, so I only have 1200 on the horizontal
[09:00:15] <farn5w0rth> how do i create tag inputs that automatically separate the tags if i copy and paste space-separated-values?
[09:00:18] <thebope> arnab_, I'm not familiar with the post method
[09:01:32] <systemfault> jorvis: Ah ok :)
[09:01:42] <arnab_> hmm, ic.
[09:03:19] <arnab_> thebope: hmm Have been stuck with it for hours now. I am sure its something very small
[09:03:38] <thebope> let me look quick
[09:04:37] <systemfault> arnab_: Try using the promise-based interface instead of the callback… that way, you'll be able to pass a "failed" handler.
[09:06:27] <thebope> yea I'm not as familiar. I use the ajax call a lot
[09:06:55] <arnab_> thebope: i see
[09:07:05] <thebope> haha
[09:07:10] <thebope> sorry man
[09:08:07] <arnab_> systemfault: could you check out this post that I put up which describes this in more detail https://forum.jquery.com/topic/handling-cookies-with-jquery
[09:09:50] <systemfault> arnab_: Not sure how this is related to cookies. Also, is the api on the same domain as the website calling it?
[09:10:13] <systemfault> arnab_: Do you have something in the console? An error?
[09:11:04] <arnab_> i have set the headers in the webserver to access the domain,
[09:11:20] <arnab_> srry i think i named it incorrectly
[09:11:49] <arnab_> yeah the console is returning the NeedToken as I mentioned in the question
[09:33:18] <angelryu_> what does (function($) {})(jQuery); mean? is it ok to use this method?
[09:34:37] <systemfault> It's not a method, it's plain Javascript.
[09:34:39] <BillCriswell> angelryu_: It's an IIFE, it's basically passing jQuery as an argument.
[09:34:51] <BillCriswell> to a function that execute immediately.
[09:35:57] <BillCriswell> (function(butts){ butts('.foo').addClass('someClass'); })(jQuery); <-- butts would be jQuery in there.
[09:38:06] <jphase> ooo la la, I came in at the right time!
[09:39:13] <midori-rus> i have a hadler .on submit, and i have a lot of similar forms on 1 page. How to send via ajax only 1 submit?
[09:40:18] <midori-rus> this is my code http://paste.ubuntu.com/7618919/
[09:41:15] <hackal> hello I need to select second element after $(this) how could I do it?
[09:45:34] <BillCriswell> hackal: You could do .next().next()
[09:46:47] <paulvd> anyone knows if roundabout plugin can be made vertical instead of horizontal, i see their options page, but not much info there
[09:48:40] <hackal> BillCriswell: Thanks it works too I ended up using this $(this).nextAll().eq(1) something like nth sibling
[09:49:06] <BillCriswell> hackal: Yeah, that could end up grabbing a lot of elements depending on the structure.
[09:49:42] <hackal> which .next().next() or nextAll()?
[09:50:49] <BillCriswell> .nextAll().eq(1) is grabbing every element "next" to $(this) and just picking out the second one.
[09:51:00] <BillCriswell> hackal: You probably don't have to worry about it. Just being over cautious.
[09:51:22] <hackal> BillCriswell: ok thanks
[09:55:43] <paulvd> wow
[09:56:50] <BillCriswell> wow?
[09:58:02] <paulvd> BillCriswell: have you used bxslider ?
[09:58:26] <BillCriswell> I have not.
[09:59:33] <paulvd> do you know of a slider which can be vertical and have the active slide as the center slide, like roundabout plugin but vertical
[10:00:48] <BillCriswell> I do not.
[10:02:50] <paulvd> lol
[10:06:47] <paulvd> anyone knows ??
[10:11:59] <angelryu> ok i understand. .......so is it completely fine if i use this in my scripts= (function($) {})(jQuery);
[10:12:42] <BillCriswell> angelryu: Not sure why you'd need to do that.
[10:12:52] <BillCriswell> Do you plan on returning anything?
[10:15:27] <angelryu> Bill: this is from an ebook, so i'm curious , this way the script works fine and i think it can avoid conflicts with other js libraries ?
[10:15:52] <angelryu> this is the snippet from ebook author: <script> (function ($) {   $('a').text('jQuery') // Sets text to jQuery, and then returns $('a').   .attr('href', 'http://www.jquery.com/') // Sets the href attribute and then returns  $('a').   .addClass('jQuery'); // Sets class and then returns $('a').   })(jQuery) </script>
[10:16:25] <BillCriswell> angelryu: Oh, you typed: scripts = (function(){})();
[10:17:02] <BillCriswell> Which is why I was confused. Yes, this would be a good way to use $ as jQuery without fail.
[10:17:33] <BillCriswell> Tons of libraries want $, only jQuery (hopefully) wants jQuery.
[10:18:26] <angelryu> here is the source file = http://bitbucket.org/syncfusion/jquery-succinctly/src/5af35280f6af4a844e77ef68fcc8264488210dd1/sample6.html?at=master
[10:18:44] <erming> is this demo page good enough? http://erming.github.io/jquery-string_to_color/ i've been doing a little make-over. feedback appreciated
[10:19:08] <angelryu> i want to know is the correct way to write jquery functions ?
[10:19:21] <angelryu> is this the correct way..
[10:19:26] <BillCriswell> erming: It's a lot more clear than the one yesterday. I dig it.
[10:20:10] <BillCriswell> angelryu: There's a lot of correct ways, that was is one of them.
[10:21:02] <erming> Thanks BillCriswell
[10:21:09] <angelryu> ok thanks Bill
[10:21:29] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:22:28] <BillCriswell> erming: The only issue I just noticed is when I load the page it autofocuses the <input> which scrolls me down the page a good bit.
[10:23:01] <BillCriswell> On a shorter viewport this would scroll past the heading.
[10:23:26] <erming> BillCriswell, oh, good catch
[10:24:05] <erming> using .focus() just to make sure people try the input.. maybe I shouldn't
[10:24:35] <angelryu> placing jquery ready() at the  bottom of a page is a proven performance strategy? is it true?
[10:25:04] <systemfault> angelryu: If you put the JS at the bottom of the page, you don't need .ready at all.
[10:25:07] <BillCriswell> angelryu: You don't need the ready if your code is before </boy>.
[10:25:27] <systemfault> angelryu: The whole point of ready is to defer the execution of a block of code until the page is fully parsed.
[10:26:47] <BillCriswell> erming: How about [input] then the color box then the hex color. I think the auto focus is OK as long as there's very little chance it won't.
[10:27:41] <angelryu> i see. tho i read in many books that scripts should go in the <head> section,,
[10:27:42] <erming> angelryu: example here http://jsfiddle.net/2Hns5/
[10:27:44] <BillCriswell> little chance it won't scroll past the header*
[10:28:00] <fpghost84> Hi, I'm looking for a script that lets me drag and drop sort several forms. A field in each form then gets updated with the position of the form on the grid. Does anyone know anything that would do this? thanks
[10:28:13] <erming> Bill, true.. Will try to swap them 'round
[10:29:53] <angelryu> so as for performance it's good idea to put all the javascript which is affecting DOM at the bottom before /body
[10:30:24] <systemfault> angelryu: It's more about "faking it"
[10:31:22] <systemfault> angelryu: Scripts are blocking so if you put them in the head, the browser will load all the scripts before showing the page to the user.
[10:31:46] <systemfault> angelryu: If you put them just before the </body>, the user will see the page but the JS won't be totally loaded.
[10:32:23] <systemfault> So in the end, it's the same… but putting scripts before </body> make the page feels like it's loading faster because the user sees something more quickly.
[10:33:17] <erming> systemfault: is that true even for the modern browsers, nowadays?
[10:33:33] <angelryu> yes that's what i read, scripts take time to load, putting at the bottom feels like the site is loading faster
[10:33:57] <erming> while i do put the before </body>, i'm not really sure if it actually gives you any faster rendering
[10:33:59] <systemfault> erming: Yes. Doing otherwise would break most of the existing website.
[10:41:47] <motaka2> is this right way to add  events to plugins? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2a50b878aff9bd952a82
[10:43:05] <erming> motaka2: use event namespace
[10:43:16] <motaka2> erming: Whats that ?
[10:43:25] <erming> https://github.com/erming/tabcomplete/blob/gh-pages/tabcomplete.js#L46
[10:43:33] <erming> you add events like this:
[10:43:53] <erming> item.on("click.namespace", function() {});
[10:44:08] <erming> then you can just use .unbind(".namespace") to remove all of them
[10:45:26] <erming> but it's optional, but a good practice
[10:45:44] <erming> anyway, in your code: have you tried using $(this).on("click") ?
[10:46:12] <erming> $(this.selector) looks kinda weird
[10:48:34] <motaka2> erming: What does this refer to in a plugin ?
[10:49:34] <thebope> motaka2, this refers to whatever scope the code is currently in
[10:49:39] <thebope> and JS in function scoped
[10:50:06] <motaka2> I really dont know
[10:50:12] <thebope> haha I know
[10:50:18] <thebope> One sec
[10:50:34] <thebope> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[10:50:51] <thebope> This is a pretty good explanation of the various ways "this" can be used in JS
[10:52:51] <motaka2> thebope: I know that. I dont know what this refers to in $.fn.plugin
[10:53:29] <erming> http://jsfiddle.net/x5B9S/
[10:53:33] <erming> threw together a little plugin :>
[10:53:38] <erming> herp-derp-plugin
[10:53:57] <thebope> motaka2, I haven't seen the link actually
[10:54:04] <jessica563> so in firefox dev tools it says this page has no sources in the debugger.
[10:54:18] <erming> motaka2: lets say you do this: $(".foo").plugin();.. now, inside plugin() "this" refers to the jQuery object $(".foo")
[10:54:32] <jessica563> nvm
[10:55:12] <motaka2> erming: Thatsthe kindof answer I looked for
[10:55:24] <motaka2> thank you
[10:55:40] <erming> good luck! it will make sense eventually :)
[10:55:49] <erming> time to take a break.. o/

[11:05:58] <Jon47> motaka2: don't load the script twice?
[11:06:31] <motaka2> Jon47: Ok let's say I did
[11:07:02] <Jon47> great, you're done!
[11:07:48] <paulvd> is anyone familiar with bxslider ?
[11:08:24] <jessica563> what is the correct syntax to check if $x[i] is undefined?
[11:09:09] <Jattenalle> jessica563, if(x[i] === undefined) or if(typeof x[i] == 'undefined')
[11:10:14] <jessica563> thanks Jattenalle
[11:10:40] <BillCriswell> if (!x[1]) as well.
[11:10:55] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, false positive!
[11:10:59] <Jattenalle> x[1] = false;
[11:11:06] <BillCriswell> Ah, good point.
[11:11:44] <Jattenalle> i think that'd trigger on x[i] = 0; as well
[11:11:55] <BillCriswell> Yeah it would.
[11:12:26] <Jattenalle> not sure why i said "i think that" since i know it will :/
[11:13:53] <BillCriswell> I do that all the time.
[11:14:42] <BillCriswell> It's like leaving in doubt in case you're wrong you won't seem to committed.
[11:15:18] <Jattenalle> hehe
[11:15:32] <Jattenalle> should throw a few "maybe, perhaps, sometimes" in there for good measure, to be safe :)
[11:16:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah. Definitely.
[11:17:37] <BillCriswell> Definitely maybe.
[11:19:42] <rmill> .g possibly maybe
[11:19:43] <b-ot> rmill: Björk - Possibly Maybe (Official HD Music Video) - YouTube → http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE11_5Spq1I
[11:21:15] <BillCriswell> There's something about that video that creeps me out.
[11:22:40] <paulvd> anyone familar with bxslider here?
[11:29:10] <gthoma2> Can someone take a look at this jsFiddle? I have a group of sliders on each page and sometimes (rarely) controlling one slider will influence a previously selected slider so that both slider handles (and values) are controlled by the newly controlled one.  http://jsfiddle.net/gthoma2/LYEHt/62/
[11:42:00] <jessica563> is there anything different in javascript about the += operator?
[11:42:25] <systemfault> Nope.
[11:42:38] <jessica563> ok
[11:42:45] <systemfault> var x = 2; x +=3;  x is not 5
[11:42:51] <systemfault> *s/not/now
[12:12:13] <paulvd> can anyone look at this > http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24126925/bxslider-set-middle-slide-as-active-slide
[12:17:28] <duch_kazatel> paulvd there's a startSlide option.
[12:36:10] <hlvwrk> how would i simplify this? http://pastebin.com/dB69hRiW
[12:36:16] <hlvwrk> i suck at js :(
[12:37:07] <duch_kazatel> if ((typeof menuClass === 'expandMenu') || (typeof id === 'undefined')) {}
[12:37:28] <hlvwrk> return, and return false
[12:37:30] <duch_kazatel> you could also abstract that check out into a function.
[12:37:31] <hlvwrk> same function?
[12:37:38] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:37:51] <hlvwrk> hmph
[12:38:37] <duch_kazatel> return; makes the function return undefined.  return false; explicitly gives the value "false"
[12:38:57] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to abort from a function if you meet those criteria?
[12:39:21] <hlvwrk> yep
[12:39:52] <duch_kazatel> turn it inside out - if ((typeof menuClass !== 'expandMenu') || (typeof id !== 'undefined')) { /* your logic here */ }
[12:40:14] <haleys> Is there a way I can change this to load with .on() I have form fields that are loading in dynamically through AJAX and the .select2() isn’t firing, so think I need to get to load via .on some how.? $('select.pretty-select').select2({ placeholder: 'Select One', allowClear: true });
[12:40:18] <hlvwrk> i'm muddying this up a bit
[12:40:28] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk or change it so the calling function runs that check instea.d
[12:40:47] <Mateo_> Weeeeell, I’m almost there :)  Now I have some trouble with my listviews. It looks like the min-height is not set correctly, so I can’t scroll to the bottom of the elements. Just a little, which is definitely not enough. What could be the reason please ?
[12:40:50] <duch_kazatel> haleys you need to initialize after the ajax has loaded.
[12:41:01] <duch_kazatel> haleys check out .done()
[12:41:42] <Mateo_> the listviews are both different, one with big cells, the other pretty classic, with a filter, and both are refreshed after the content is set
[12:41:57] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Right. I can re-initialize via the AJAX, but wanted to see if I could just have initialize once via .on that works for both ajax and non ajax requests. I’ll check out done though.
[12:42:22] <duch_kazatel> haleys .on() is for event binding.  your problem isn't about that ;)
[12:42:52] <haleys> duch_kazatel: True! :)
[12:44:24] <game16> hey
[12:46:06] <duch_kazatel> hello
[12:49:14] <Mateo_> Looks like the min-height is not set properly
[12:49:43] <game16> Is it insecure to store oauth access tokens with cookies?
[12:51:25] <duch_kazatel> game16 it can be.
[12:51:30] <duch_kazatel> security.stackexchange.com/questions/45928/is-it-safe-to-give-an-oauth-token-to-client-side-javascript-so-it-can-directly-m
[12:51:32] <game16> When does it ?
[12:52:03] <duch_kazatel> even if you properly use cookies, XSS and CSRF are concerns.
[13:01:40] <game16> so I should just use sessions?
[13:03:03] <duch_kazatel> game16 yep.  let the browser handle it.
[13:04:15] <dave_2> hello there can anyone help with this http://jsfiddle.net/h6hnj/
[13:04:27] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 what's your question?
[13:05:08] <duch_kazatel> woah....
[13:05:17] <duch_kazatel> use curly brackets, they're good for you.
[13:06:11] <dave_2> i'm trying to show prices based  on number of miles, but i'm not getting the right price not sure why
[13:06:19] <duch_kazatel> wrong AND
[13:06:59] <dave_2> it should be &&?
[13:07:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h6hnj/1/
[13:07:34] <duch_kazatel> also turn your logic inside out - you were running the same check over and over.
[13:08:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/h6hnj/2/ <- this is what you want anctually.
[13:08:10] <duch_kazatel> *actually
[13:09:54] <duch_kazatel> this self review is hard.
[13:10:37] <BillCriswell> You're supposed to review yourself?
[13:10:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  it's apart of our annual review process.
[13:11:16] <BillCriswell> I'd get myself fired.
[13:11:19] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha.
[13:11:26] <BillCriswell> "I really, barely do anything all day."
[13:11:35] <duch_kazatel> that means you're a good employee ;)
[13:11:52] <BillCriswell> Haha
[13:13:29] <__joshua___> Management material.
[13:13:49] <duch_kazatel> our managers are all pretty good for the most part.
[13:14:17] <duch_kazatel> hands off, let us work on what we want to work on as long as it's actually contributing something.
[13:14:46] <BillCriswell> Autonomy accomplishes a lot.
[13:15:13] <duch_kazatel> if you treat your employees like adults...
[13:15:41] <dave_2> duch_kazatel still it's not giving right calculation uploaded here http://technocia.com/map_api/2/
[13:15:55] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 can you make a functioning jsfiddle?
[13:17:23] <dave_2> duch_kazatel can you please check here http://technocia.com/map_api/2/
[13:17:40] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 i'd really rather work against a fiddle tbh.
[13:18:42] <jfranks> Problems with selecting a label : http://jsbin.com/kokefetu/1/edit  (I was trying http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/)?
[13:19:07] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 also - you only need one document ready - you can put everything in a single one.
[13:23:28] <skinux> How do we access form elements with jQuery? Is it $("ElementID").val(..)?
[13:23:43] <duch_kazatel> that's one way
[13:23:43] <__joshua___> jfranks: a selector token selects one thing.  you have input, and 'for' in the same part
[13:24:01] <shoky> $("#ElementID")
[13:24:15] <duch_kazatel> skinux $('anyValidSelector')
[13:25:51] <skinux> How do we get all elements of a form?
[13:25:55] <dave_2> duch_kazatel but this isn't working (also api not working)
[13:26:51] <duch_kazatel> skinux $('form *'), but something tells me that's not really what you want.
[13:27:01] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 huh?
[13:27:22] <dave_2> http://jsfiddle.net/9Mck6/
[13:27:30] <skinux> I';d like to iterate through all elements of the form, checking that everything has been entered.
[13:28:03] <duch_kazatel> $('form input') should get you started.
[13:28:30] <skinux> Will that return an array of elements??
[13:28:36] <duch_kazatel> skinux yes.
[13:28:57] <skinux> Okay.
[13:29:14] <BillCriswell> If you need textareas and selects $('form :input') would include those
[13:29:22] <__joshua___> an "array-like" list
[13:29:32] <BillCriswell> Though you should probably just look into a validation library.
[13:29:49] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ is right - the jquery selector returns an array-like object, but a validation library will save you some headaches here.
[13:30:08] <jfranks> __joshua___: Hmm.. but $("input [for='subal']") without them lumped together fails too?
[13:30:29] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 that fiddle completely defeats the purpose of a fiddle.
[13:30:40] <jfranks> I'm tempted to be lazy and add IDs.. but I should learn.
[13:31:46] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 we'll do this your way - http://technocia.com/map_api/2/ what's wrong here?  how do I replicate the problem?
[13:32:09] <__joshua___> jfranks: you need to know (most) of this stuff for css anyway
[13:33:12] <jfranks> __joshua___: Yep. I'd love to select the <label> with the attribute 'for' set to 'subal' .. But still cannot seem to understand the syntax.
[13:33:48] <__joshua___> label[for=subal]  doesn't work?
[13:34:15] <jfranks> Er... have I been typing 'input' this whole time? (*FP*)
[13:34:36] <__joshua___> yeah, i tried to hint to you about that before ;p
[13:34:43] <jfranks> Ahhhh! Thanks!
[13:36:05] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 it's failing on line 204 of main.js - open up your console.  you're dynamically creating variables based on what's selected on pageload, instead of setting values when things are clicked.
[13:39:53] <saucey> what is the best js framework out there
[13:39:59] <dave_2> dutch_kazatel i'm failing to comeup with right price based on calculated miles distance http://technocia.com/map_api/2/ , it's midnight trying from morning :(
[13:40:21] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 open your console and see what part of the problem is.
[13:40:29] <duch_kazatel> saucey depends - what are you using it for?
[13:40:40] <saucey> things like ajax
[13:41:02] <saucey> ajax calls page animation and so...
[13:41:17] <duch_kazatel> saucey you can use jquery to handle all that for you instead.
[13:41:22] <duch_kazatel> no need for a whole framework.
[13:41:35] <dave_2> dutch_kazatel i've reuploaded things there
[13:41:40] <saucey> ok well whats a js framework actually good for
[13:41:44] <duch_kazatel> *duch
[13:41:52] <duch_kazatel> saucey depends on what you want.
[13:42:18] <saucey> well i have a AMS
[13:42:25] <saucey> with routes and stuff
[13:42:33] <duch_kazatel> "ams"?
[13:42:41] <saucey> cms
[13:43:27] <duch_kazatel> saucey "framework" is generally something you write your application "on top of" - they can be for all kinds of things, so asking "what's the best one?" ignores the important part - what do you need from it?
[13:44:00] <duch_kazatel> if you need an MV*, then look at Backbone and Angular - those are pretty popular.
[13:44:43] <duch_kazatel> if you'd like something similar to an MV* without the OO ideals, check out some FRP frameworks.  Or if you want something minimal, look at Riot.js
[13:44:57] <__joshua___> backbone is really just 4 objects, it doesn't hold your hand while you structure your app.  angular is pretty different to most things... you will have to relearn a few basics
[13:45:18] <duch_kazatel> i'm just trying to explain why their question is hard to answer.
[13:45:23] <saucey> ok
[13:50:20] <w00tb3ast> is it possible do to something like if( current url != homepage url ){ remove meta element by name }
[13:50:21] <skinux> Any good training videos for using JS and PHP together?
[13:50:29] <w00tb3ast> (thats not actual code)
[13:50:36] <skinux> I don't mean with XML/JSON
[13:51:01] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast sure, but why would you do that?
[13:51:44] <w00tb3ast> I have a stupid codeigniter project that only uses one view generated by php and I want to hide the app store banner if you're on any page other than the home page
[13:52:05] <w00tb3ast> basically because every other page is used in an android app haha
[13:52:06] <blindMoe> w00tb3ast: seems like it would be best to use the php side and just add it on that one page
[13:52:19] <w00tb3ast> true I suppose you're right
[14:00:41] <SadFish> Weird bug involving a jquery/primefaces page - after the page load, "jQuery183039664177394866684  :  44" remains at the top of the DOM - it prevents UI queries from functioning until a 'reset' button has been clicked.  Any idea where this might be coming from, or at least a good way to start troubleshooting?
[14:02:37] <saucey> can one of u guys show me an example of load form partials
[14:04:07] <BillCriswell> saucey: Say what?
[14:04:57] <rgk> on a jquery ui slider, how can i get the last value of the slide?
[14:05:13] <rgk> slidestop seems to be triggered every snap
[14:05:51] <duch_kazatel> saucey whosawhat?
[14:06:08] <BillCriswell> rgk: That's not what the docs say.
[14:06:15] <BillCriswell> rgk: Have a demo?

[14:08:36] <frozenyogurt> i have popovers show and they work fine on chrome
[14:08:41] <frozenyogurt> but in firefox the freeze up
[14:08:44] <frozenyogurt> and some dont go away
[14:08:55] <__joshua___> freeze?
[14:09:03] <frozenyogurt> http://toldev.herokuapp.com/talks
[14:09:08] <frozenyogurt> see that top thingy
[14:09:17] <frozenyogurt> in chrome it works fine
[14:09:22] <frozenyogurt> they go in and out
[14:09:29] <__joshua___> right
[14:09:32] <frozenyogurt> but on firefox/safari they hold up
[14:09:41] <duch_kazatel> frozenyogurt not for me.
[14:09:48] <__joshua___> right, so mouseout not working for ya?
[14:09:54] <duch_kazatel> they work fine in FF>
[14:10:02] <duch_kazatel> oh i see it now.
[14:10:03] <frozenyogurt> http://pastebin.com/0rSTbweb
[14:10:13] <frozenyogurt> im using mouseleave
[14:10:16] <duch_kazatel> why do people re-paste their code like that?
[14:10:20] <__joshua___> working in ff 29 for me
[14:10:27] <frozenyogurt> try going over the small ones
[14:10:29] <frozenyogurt> fast
[14:10:32] <frozenyogurt> or try safari
[14:10:38] <frozenyogurt> safari is the main culprit
[14:11:15] <__joshua___> sorry, can't be assed installing wine
[14:11:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:11:35] <duch_kazatel> isn't wine for running windows applications?
[14:11:39] <__joshua___> yeah
[14:11:47] <__joshua___> safari has native linux support now?
[14:11:57] <duch_kazatel> safari isn't a windows browser.
[14:12:01] <duch_kazatel> it's Mac's
[14:12:13] <DelphiWorld> any good recomanded photo gallery plugin for JQ?
[14:12:14] <duch_kazatel> they stopped supporting windows a few versions ago.
[14:12:22] <__joshua___> ah, so they did
[14:12:44] <__joshua___> frozenyogurt: are you getting multiple popups at once?
[14:13:04] <frozenyogurt> yes
[14:13:18] <duch_kazatel> ah for the little movie thumbnail deals.
[14:13:19] <_jmg> hi, i'm using multiple ajax $.get().done() functions, but i am getting the wrong data back in the done functions, sometimes all the done functions receive the same data .. can anyone point me in the right direction, or know why this might be happening?
[14:13:27] <frozenyogurt> well essentially they dont dissaper
[14:13:38] <duch_kazatel> _jmg i'd have to see how your code is setup.
[14:14:06] <__joshua___> frozenyogurt: why not kill all existing popups when you mouse over a new one?
[14:15:34] <frozenyogurt> for some reason i cant
[14:15:41] <frozenyogurt> i tried doing
[14:15:55] <frozenyogurt> $('.popover').popover('hide');
[14:15:58] <frozenyogurt> and it got worse
[14:18:03] <_jmg> duch_kazatel: sure, i'm using ajaxsetup, and have set cache to false, and use that to set a header id, other than that, just a straight forward $.get().done() .. i've tried using when, even though i don't need the results to be sync'd, but nothing helps
[14:18:27] <_jmg> duch_kazatel: any thoughts what could cause that?
[14:18:58] <skinux> Is there any way to check if a script has already been linked by markup page
[14:18:59] <skinux> ?
[14:20:08] <duch_kazatel> _jmg can you share some code?
[14:20:09] <skinux> As in, a way for AScript to check if jQuery has been linked into page before AScript was linked?
[14:20:24] <duch_kazatel> skinux you can check if an object has been loaded, yeah.
[14:20:33] <duch_kazatel> is that what you mean?
[14:20:40] <skinux> Only if jQuery is an object
[14:20:49] <_jmg> duch_kazatel: sure, one min, cheers
[14:21:10] <duch_kazatel> skinux it is ;)
[14:21:17] <duch_kazatel> everything is an object is JS.  functions are object.
[14:21:17] <skinux> How would that be done?
[14:21:28] <duch_kazatel> typeof jQuery
[14:21:51] <skinux> if (type jQuery) { // jQuery has been loaded} ??
[14:22:02] <duch_kazatel> if (typeof maybeObject != "undefined") {}
[14:22:22] <duch_kazatel> or if (jQuery) {}
[14:22:27] <duch_kazatel> a few different ways.
[14:23:38] <skinux> Isn't $("form").submit(); correct?
[14:23:58] <duch_kazatel> what are you expecting that to do?
[14:24:14] <skinux> Submit the form after field validation is done
[14:24:43] <duch_kazatel> that's submit the form again, yes.  do you have an event handler on the form that runs a preventDefault() ?
[14:24:57] <skinux> No.
[14:25:10] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code, then?
[14:25:38] <skinux> All I did was put a validate function call in form's onClick attribute
[14:25:51] <duch_kazatel> that smells to me.
[14:25:58] <duch_kazatel> sharing your code would be helpful.
[14:26:12] <duch_kazatel> using the onclick attribute is generally a bad idea.
[14:26:20] <skinux> Do I need to use a specific paste site?
[14:26:30] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ skinux
[14:26:30] <b-ot> skinux: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:26:34] <duch_kazatel> those are preferred.
[14:28:37] <skinux> Try this: http://jsbin.com/puvifiki/1/
[14:28:48] <duch_kazatel> woah... broken.
[14:29:05] <duch_kazatel> you copied and pasted your whole page...
[14:29:44] <duch_kazatel> can you pair down your example a little to a small test case?

[14:31:10] <DelphiWorld> it's pocible to load a static external content from a html page into a div?
[14:31:17] <duch_kazatel> _jmg i see you're getting help over in #javascript, too.  i'll let them figure it out first.
[14:31:31] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld using $.ajax(), maybe.
[14:31:38] <skinux> I can't find a paste button on JSFiddle
[14:31:43] <_jmg> duch_kazatel: been stuck on this one all day
[14:31:49] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: example please?
[14:31:51] <duch_kazatel> skinux huh?
[14:32:04] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery ajax
[14:32:05] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery.ajax() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[14:32:35] <DelphiWorld> thx duch_kazatel
[14:32:41] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld also, check out http://api.jquery.com/load/
[14:33:25] <skinux> JSFiddle.net doesn't seem to show a button to paste or share my code.
[14:33:39] <duch_kazatel> skinux click "save" and then copy the URL of the page;
[14:34:03] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld .load() uses .ajax() under the hood.  $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" ); is the basic gist, though be aware that depending on what you're doing, you might not be able to do this.
[14:34:57] <skinux> Saving tries to download it to my computer.
[14:35:22] <skinux> There are no buttons for saving or anything like that....only CTRL+S

[14:36:11] <duch_kazatel> unless you've saved at least once before, in which case it's this: http://i.imgur.com/Uurb0dC.png
[14:36:22] <s2013> http://codepen.io/ss2k/pen/dBFLe/ any reason why the slideshow isnt working when i browse for images?
[14:36:27] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: that'lle be used with jqm also, is there anything should i take care of?
[14:36:49] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld are you ajaxing in content from the same domain?
[14:36:52] <duch_kazatel> or from somewhere else?
[14:37:04] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld also: i generally suggest you avoid doing what you're trying to in the first palce.
[14:37:08] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: yeah, just for easy page management
[14:37:32] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld then you need to set it up so that you can get just the fragments themselves, instead of the entire page.
[14:37:36] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: i have a single html page with several pages inside navigating using #page
[14:38:01] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: mean?
[14:38:33] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld it sounds like what you want to do is hit a URL, grab a specific div from that URL, and then put that into the current page, right?
[14:39:28] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: not only div, but the entire page which have a content, a header and a footer
[14:39:37] <DelphiWorld> hold on duch_kazatel
[14:39:57] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld err, that sounds terribly inefficient.  why would you do that?
[14:40:06] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: see here
[14:40:08] <skinux> duch_kazatel: Here is the paste: http://fixee.org/paste/p1asmbz/
[14:40:08] <duch_kazatel> well, that can be terribly inefficient.
[14:40:12] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: <li><a href="#rss" data-role="button">News</a></li>
[14:40:28] <duch_kazatel> skinux ... what happened to the fiddle?
[14:40:34] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: this page news i wish to load it from external page, got me?
[14:41:25] <duch_kazatel> skinux you want to use $('form').on('submit', formValidate); instead.
[14:41:26] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[14:41:43] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld right - that doesn't answer my question ;)
[14:42:05] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld so you're going to hit that URL and use AJAX to load in a specific part of that page, right?
[14:42:51] <dave_2> still not able to come up with anything
[14:42:54] <duch_kazatel> skinux also, for each(elements as element) { doesn't make sense.  use use elements.each(function(){});
[14:43:37] <skinux> Sorry, I'm used to writing PHP
[14:43:49] <duch_kazatel> skinux let me show you a basic example.
[14:46:13] <frozenyogurt> hey so anyone with safari experince wanna help me out?

[14:46:52] <frozenyogurt> it only doesnt work in safari though
[14:46:55] <frozenyogurt> it lags
[14:46:59] <hackal> Can I use .val() to set content inside <h3> tag?
[14:47:04] <frozenyogurt> and has popovers stay open
[14:47:14] <duch_kazatel> hackal .val() is for inputs.
[14:47:34] <duch_kazatel> skinux http://jsfiddle.net/j4Xgw/
[14:47:34] <hackal> duch_kazatel: ok what should I use for h3 or for other elements
[14:47:43] <duch_kazatel> hackal do you want the contents of them?
[14:47:46] <frozenyogurt> hackal: text
[14:47:59] <duch_kazatel> either .text() or .html(), depending on what you looking for.
[14:48:31] <hackal> duch_kazatel: I am looking for text. And thank you very much
[15:33:29] <traviata> hmm can anyone take a look and let me know why this is working in chrome but not firefox? no errors in console. http://jsfiddle.net/2S9Wy/
[15:40:08] <systemfault> traviata: Try animating 'body, html' instead of just 'body'
[15:43:16] <traviata> systemfault oh awesome, it works. makes sense after reading about it since mozilla's overflow is set at the HTML level
[15:43:19] <traviata> thanks!
[15:43:27] <systemfault> :)
[15:44:54] <EminenceHC> How do I check if a boolean value is true or false? I can't seem to find out how.
[15:45:13] <EminenceHC> Preferably something in this syntax:  if($(this).val() === true){
[15:46:45] <systemfault> EminenceHC: .val() always return a string.
[15:46:53] <systemfault> returns
[15:47:46] <ornerymoose> Hello, I’m having some weird behavior using the jquery backstretch plugin, or maybe document.ready is the wrong choice here: When I load my page, the images load quickly and correctly. But If i go to another link/page, the images will only appear there on a browser refresh. And same goes for going back to the landing page (the images will only appear on refresh). How do I resolve this so the images are always there, no refresh needed?
[15:47:46] <ornerymoose> http://codeshare.io/0isC4
[15:48:12] <EminenceHC> systemfault: So how come  if($(this).val() === "true"){   is not recognizing boolean fields?
[15:48:34] <systemfault> EminenceHC: It will work if $(this).val() is equal = "true"
[15:50:35] <EminenceHC> systemfault: My boolean field's value is "1" but it doesn't change to "0" when unchecked. How can I detect the boolean change?
[15:51:05] <systemfault> EminenceHC: You could check if it's checked/unchecked
[15:51:17] <systemfault> if ($(this).prop('checked'))
[15:51:28] <EminenceHC> systemfault: Ah ok, thank you.
[17:10:58] <alexw> How would I get all :input where they don't have a parent with class .dont_change_on_hide
[17:11:07] <alexw> this could be a parent at any level
[17:12:32] <BillCriswell> alexw: You could use .filter() and check .closest('.dont_change_on_hide')'s length.
[17:12:50] <__joshua___> or use :not() selector in the first place
[17:12:50] <BillCriswell> I feel like you might be doing something odd though. What's your goal?
[17:13:52] <BillCriswell> Yeah I guess ':not(.dont_change_on_hide) :input' would work.
[17:14:01] <il> is there a Datatables channel?
[17:14:10] <EminenceHC> Is there a way to convert Date().getTime() in query to ruby?
[17:14:11] <BillCriswell> il: Many of them.
[17:14:30] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC whosawhat?
[17:14:31] <EminenceHC> jquery*
[17:14:47] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Trying to take the date output of Date().getTime() and convert it to a ruby date.
[17:14:54] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC you can send over a string and parse that.
[17:15:34] <il> BillCriswell, just did a search. none on freenode
[17:15:45] <BillCriswell> il: What kind of database?
[17:15:50] <il> jquery.datatables
[17:15:51] <duch_kazatel> il it'd be for a specific db, like mysql or postgres.
[17:15:56] <duch_kazatel> il that's not a database...
[17:16:01] <il> i never said database
[17:16:08] <duch_kazatel> oh derp my bad.
[17:16:14] <BillCriswell> Haha definitely did not.
[17:16:14] <alexw> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/q6MLx/
[17:16:22] <il> lol
[17:16:36] <alexw> Basically I have a function that will hide/show input groups based on a value of that input
[17:16:37] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I don't think there's a channel specific to this.
[17:16:46] <duch_kazatel> doesn't look like there is one.
[17:16:47] <il> damn
[17:16:59] <alexw> So if you select a radio button it may hide/show groups
[17:17:00] <il> their docs are all over the place
[17:17:10] <Azrael_-> would be fun to integrate full sql-syntax/capabilities into jquery :)
[17:17:17] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Do you know of any documentation that shows how to parse the Jquery date format? I don't understand what the date: 1402359428179 means.
[17:17:20] <il> Azrael_-, no
[17:17:29] <il> unless you like getting hacked
[17:17:31] <alexw> BillCriswell it then resets the inputs values for the inputs that have been hidden
[17:17:41] <Azrael_-> il: i thought it was hilarious enough to be obivously sarcastic
[17:18:00] <il> well you never know, Azrael_-
[17:18:05] <Azrael_-> :)
[17:18:05] <alexw> BillCriswell however I'm trying to exclude that functionality (resetting) for a few inputs that are in a container with class . dont_change_on_hide
[17:18:40] <BillCriswell> alexw: You could use :not like __joshua___ suggested
[17:19:14] <alexw> BillCriswell but it doesn't work if the parent with class .dont_change_on_hide is a few levels up
[17:19:17] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC that's the JavaScript date format
[17:19:30] <il> anyone have experience with jquery.datatables?
[17:19:31] <duch_kazatel> but that's probably the current epoch time.
[17:19:34] <BillCriswell> alexw: Yeah it would.
[17:19:48] <__joshua___> alexw: yeah, but either '>' or use a selector for the container
[17:20:01] <__joshua___> il:  ive used datatables.  whats your question?
[17:20:07] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ah ok I was looking at jquery not javascript. I am sure I will be able to find out how to parse it into ruby DateTime. Thanks
[17:20:44] <alexw> BillCriswell here is a snippet of the HTML: http://jsfiddle.net/gV8Rp/1/
[17:21:03] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC it looks like ruby's Date class can parse number of seconds since the Unix Epoch, so it should be pretty trivial.
[17:21:05] <il> __joshua___, I am trying to show and hide certain columns with the simple .column function ( https://datatables.net/reference/api/column().visible())
[17:21:40] <il> But I keep getting "undefined is not a function" for "table.column(1).visible(false);"
[17:21:51] <il> table is defined as a Datatable
[17:21:57] <il> Simple stuff isn't working
[17:22:05] <__joshua___> using at least 1.10?
[17:22:19] <il> damn, nope
[17:22:20] <il> 1.9.4
[17:22:36] <il> Lol thanks man, upgrading
[17:22:39] <alexw> BillCriswell easiest option is to probally just apply that class to the input itself
[17:25:04] <BillCriswell> alexw: All these inputs are in dont_change_on_hide ?
[17:25:06] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Looks like I divide the number by 1000 then call Time.at(integer_after_being_divided_by_1000). Thanks again.
[17:32:29] <il> __joshua___, undefined is still not a function
[17:32:38] <il> I mean I'm still getting "undefined is not a funciton"
[17:41:23] <__joshua___> il: can you make a jsfiddle?
[18:35:39] <antlong_> im having an issue with tooltipster, when you click the navigation, it shows new items, but the tooltipster tooltip is stale. here's an example: http://imgur.com/gg27nqM
[18:38:02] <nownot> should https://gist.github.com/anonymous/32eb7a250f1ed4c17f1b work? it’s not but not seeing the error
[18:49:16] <nownot> im looking for a way to auto submit a link once its appended to the html, thoughts?
[18:51:37] <acidjazz> ok so
[18:52:02] <acidjazz> i have this common situation where i have events on doms that are re-freshed or load again via ajax.. whats the best practice now? using .on right? and how?
[18:52:34] <acidjazz> $('.button').on('click', do.click.func);
[18:52:35] <acidjazz> right
[18:52:47] <acidjazz> or do i bind to document..
[18:52:50] <__joshua___> well, you can delegate on the parent element that doesn't refresh
[18:53:09] <__joshua___> or you can reattach the listeners after a rerender.
[18:53:36] <__joshua___> $('static_parent').on('click', 'dynamic_child', function(){ .....
[18:53:50] <acidjazz> i see
[18:54:01] <acidjazz> is it more optimized to attach to the parent
[18:54:07] <acidjazz> than say document
[18:54:09] <acidjazz> it seems liek it would be
[18:54:18] <__joshua___> yeah, less bubbling
[18:55:10] <acidjazz> sweet
[18:55:12] <acidjazz> that makes more sense
[18:55:26] <acidjazz> and what exactly is 'this' in this event function.. can i .parent it?
[18:56:03] <__joshua___> this is the currentTarget, i think
[18:57:02] <acidjazz> i see
[18:58:10] <acidjazz> so what loks off
[18:58:16] <acidjazz> is the events you specify
[18:58:22] <acidjazz> these are jquery selectors w/out the $()
[18:58:37] <acidjazz> why $(docuiment).on('click', '.class', function() {} );
[18:58:38] <acidjazz> and not
[18:58:44] <acidjazz> why $(docuiment).on('click', $('.class'), function() {} );
[18:59:02] <acidjazz> is that because it just does $(document).find('.class') ?
[18:59:12] <acidjazz> and scrapes the dom w/in ?
[18:59:18] <acidjazz> odd
[19:03:13] <__joshua___> why $(docuiment).on('click', '.class', function() {} );?  jquery sees the delegate string and knows how to deal with it
[19:04:39] <__joshua___> it binds a click handler to document (bad), and when it fires, it checks currentTarget, if that is equal to the delegated selector it triggers the click handler
[19:34:40] <naeluh> test??
[20:05:19] <disappearedng_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24132203/data-design-whats-the-best-way-to-store-tasks-generated-by-a-scheduler if anyone can give me some constructive criticism I would really appreciate it
[20:13:02] <jphase> disappearedng_: not really sure how that would apply to this channel friend
[20:17:43] <traviata> hey guys, I'm a bit stuck and hoping you can help. I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/12/ which works. When I scroll down, the image scrolls down with it and when the image is completely shown, it'll be fixed on the bottom until the user scrolls up again. The problem is though, it doesn't work when I have a smaller image but not sure what to do to fix it :  http://jsfiddle.net/nc55g/
[20:19:43] <traviata> I'm not sure how to add the logic so that it won't simply jump to the bottom of the screen if the image is smaller than the screen height
[20:19:49] <jphase> traviata: smaller meaning smaller than the height of the window?
[20:19:55] <jphase> ic
[20:20:15] <jphase> well just wrap the entire thing in a check to see if the img height is < the window height
[20:23:46] <traviata> jphase awesome, yeah it works. just one quick question- do you know why it jumps when you scroll down initially? http://jsfiddle.net/nc55g/2/
[20:25:11] <traviata> jphase oh silly question- because I have the function running only on scroll, so it scrolls first, then fixes position
[20:25:16] <traviata> thanks! got it
[20:25:18] <jphase> traviata: I'd suggest making the image section have a class of fixed initially, then removing it when you need to instead of the other way around
[20:25:20] <jphase> yeah
[20:25:24] <jphase> flip the logic
[20:25:31] <traviata> awesome, thanks!
[20:25:35] <jphase> np
[20:29:46] <il> what are the best jquery plugins for graphs and charts?
[20:31:05] <jphase> I personally use highcharts
[20:31:24] <VectorX> hi, can someone tell me where i can find the tooltip that is set for the markers http://fiddle.jshell.net/A2yDk/1/ , if you were looking at the dom hieararchy in chrome for instance
[20:31:31] <jphase> but google has some good stuff, and if you want to get crazy there's d3js and some other trigonometric stuff
[20:34:59] <il> thanks jphase
[20:35:05] <il> it's better than d3, jphase?
[20:35:31] <jphase> highcharts is not really comparable to d3js
[20:35:45] <jphase> d3js is in a league of its own. data visualization != charting really
[20:35:57] <il> ohh ok
[20:36:01] <jphase> I mean, it can be used for charting, but it's more for advanced trigonometric data mapping
[20:36:14] <il> i thought highcharts had more capabilities than just rendering charts
[20:36:17] <il> right
[20:36:35] <il> highcharts looks like its better for charting than d3 though
[20:36:40] <il> and has 100x better documentation
[20:36:40] <jphase> yeah definitely
[20:36:44] <jphase> it's totally for charting
[20:36:54] <il> I was headdesking with d3
[20:36:57] <il> sweet, thanks
[20:37:00] <jphase> np
[20:37:41] <il> oh shit man I thought this was free
[20:38:02] <il> oh it is... I think
[20:38:35] <jphase> well it's free, but to use it on a public facing site you need to keep the creds in there
[20:38:46] <jphase> er... the advert back to highcharts.com on the bottom right
[20:39:07] <jphase> for an admin tool, or password protected site, doesn't matter though and it's a simple option you pass in the js object
[20:40:11] <antlong_> is addClass the fastest option to change css?
[20:40:19] <systemfault> Yes.
[23:38:28] <acidjazz> 1st watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0iRbfxPpVY&feature=youtu.be&t=9s , then watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnphFxH3FxM#t=28 and lol
[23:39:17] <alexw> Is it possible to listen for a div visiblity?
[23:44:41] <traviata> alexw   $('#div').is(':visible'); should work
[23:44:48] <alexw> So i'd need a timeout?
[23:51:02] <Cork> alexw: what is it you're trying to do?
[23:51:13] <larsemil> i have a list of objects, they all have three classes, and the third is unique. how do i filter the first two classes?
[23:51:55] <Cork> larsemil: .attr('class').replace(' known-class').split(' ')
[23:52:10] <Cork> opps
[23:52:13] <Cork> larsemil: .attr('class').replace(' known-class', '').split(' ')
[23:53:38] <dave_2> this doesn't return expected result http://jsfiddle.net/V82MN/1/ as it should return
[23:54:47] <Cork> dave_2: define your variables!
[23:55:09] <Cork> and you should never do attr('class', 'ui-selected')
[23:55:36] <larsemil> Cork: <3
[23:57:17] <Cork> dave_2: can't really say much more apart from that
[23:57:22] <Cork> too much context is missing
[23:57:24] <dave_2> this will do http://jsfiddle.net/V82MN/1/ ? i was trying to get boolean from defaultcar
[23:57:47] <dave_2> oops http://jsfiddle.net/V82MN/2/
[23:58:17] <Cork> dave_2: you should prob use id instead of name
[23:59:35] <Cork> dave_2: try adding the code needed for the code to run
[23:59:41] <Cork> (mainly the missing html)
