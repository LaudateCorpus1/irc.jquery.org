[00:00:11] <R13ose> Hi
[02:54:45] <Mark_2_PC> hi
[04:03:06] <GingerGeek> If I override the contents of a div with .load() will all of the listeners attached to the previous elements be gone? Even if .load replaces it with identical content?
[04:04:40] <DonEdu> Could you tell me what event is fired when an element is removed from a div? thanks!
[04:18:47] <arthurvr> GingerGeek: Yes, it will.
[04:19:03] <GingerGeek> ty
[04:32:13] <Saberu> adding a 32nd var is killing jQuery ajax
[04:32:23] <Saberu> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ShJQ8yMh
[05:04:43] <Edu-J> Could anyone tell me which event must listen when an element is removed from a div?
[05:05:51] <R13ose> Edu-J: $("#myDiv").on("remove", function () { }
[05:09:41] <skypce> i have this:  $('.flexslider ul li:last').after($('.flexslider ul li:first'));
[05:09:41] <skypce>   i try to implement with flexslider but doesnt work.
[05:09:42] <Edu-J> R13ose, thanks a lot, I'm trying it ;)
[05:09:53] <R13ose> Edu-J: great
[05:10:09] <R13ose> skypce: what isn't working?
[05:11:40] <skypce> http://i.imgur.com/NeTQ5m1.png  the last slide doesnt continue looping
[06:03:43] <jop008>  Ajax setup json error 3[{"success":"true"}] parsererror what can be wrong
[06:08:20] <lemonem> this works fine, if i have only 1 match: replaceText.replace(pattern, function(string, match) { //match = $1; return xyz; }); how can I use the same way of calling a function with 2 matches $1, $2?
[06:10:22] <lemonem> replaceText.replace(pattern, function(string, match) { //match[0] = $1; match[1] = $2 return xyz; }) doesn't work
[06:12:07] <lemonem> replaceText.replace(pattern, 'foo$1bar$2') is the way it is now and that works, i just have to do some more stuff, so i want to pass $1, $2 to a function (for clarification)
[06:23:29] <R13ose> jop008: need more details
[06:24:38] <R13ose> lemonem: why not make match an array?
[06:39:32] <lemonem> R13ose: how would I do that,  function(string, match[]) ?
[06:45:12] <R13ose> lemonem: thinking
[06:49:14] <R13ose> lemonem: you should read up on this.
[07:00:28] <lemonem> R13ose: sure, could you provide any links? function(string, match = [$1, $2]) or function(string, match = array($1, $2)) didn't work either
[07:02:11] <dommel> user inputs value in field, value is appended to page, page refreshes. User inputs new value in same field, new value is appended to page but with old value in front of it instead of replacing it...

[07:06:29] <R13ose> left nuts
[07:15:54] <dommel> how do i dynamically replace old value of variable, if new value is defined to the variable?
[07:25:30] <atomicB0mb> wtf this is not working ? http://www.joyncorp.com/homologacao/ (go to "serviços") section... why????????
[07:26:11] <atomicB0mb> the js: https://jsfiddle.net/r5Lbzrrd/
[07:27:41] <atomicB0mb> anyone??
[07:29:31] <atomicB0mb> =(
[07:33:21] <krasimir> http://pastebin.com/7x11PfqK
[07:33:22] <krasimir> hi all
[07:33:38] <krasimir> I have this code which submits a form using ajax
[07:33:53] <krasimir> first it calls a confirm function to confirm the action
[07:34:11] <lintguy> how do i test if the currently clicked object have a specific classname? (There are several classes on the object)
[07:34:33] <krasimir> I want teh confirm function to change to disable the submit button to prevent another click.
[07:35:31] <Meir`> atomicB0mb, perhaps you meant to refer: var target = $('#'+$(this).attr('name'));
[07:35:44] <krasimir> lintguy : $(this).attr('class')   return all classes and you can run a check if empty
[07:36:41] <Meir`> atomicB0mb, because you try to scroll the item inside the "services-features-wrap-carrosel"" div
[07:37:03] <Meir`> but instead you run the scrolling on the clicked menu item
[07:37:38] <lintguy> krasimir: That's what i would do if it was only one class, it is never empty.
[07:37:53] <atomicB0mb> Meir', but as you can see, the first click works.. If I refresh the page and try the second item, it will for his target
[07:38:09] <atomicB0mb> if you click and refresh, u get the work done...
[07:38:29] <krasimir> lintguy : use indexof --->> if ($(this).attr('class').indexOf('class_name')>-1){  code here}
[07:39:32] <atomicB0mb> on click event, i check the distance of my li to his ul. And then i use this distance to animate li's left.
[07:39:40] <atomicB0mb> i just cant find the error
[07:39:47] <lintguy> krasimir: silly of me to not think of indexOf, thank you
[07:40:31] <Meir`> atomicB0mb, so i'm afraid i didn't get your calculating
[07:41:16] <atomicB0mb> u can check the console to see it
[07:41:36] <Meir`> it could be by accident
[07:41:39] <atomicB0mb> on click theres the distance it should slide...
[07:42:03] <Meir`> yeah but it doesn't make sense that it's valid after refresh
[07:42:13] <atomicB0mb> yes!...
[07:42:16] <Meir`> please try my suggestion
[07:42:21] <atomicB0mb> sure..
[07:42:47] <Meir`> the real target you should seek is the one in the carrosel div
[07:42:54] <Meir`> and not the clicked menu item
[07:43:56] <atomicB0mb> actually, this is what im doing. the <li> MENU has a atribute called name. And this 'name' atribute has the same value of the carrosel div LI.
[07:44:16] <atomicB0mb> I am targeting the UL LI inside the carrosel div
[07:44:41] <krasimir> http://pastebin.com/7x11PfqK  - how do you get the dom from the ajax_submit function in the second confirm_action function ?
[07:44:50] <Meir`> yeah, but you should select the element with an *id* of that name
[07:45:15] <Meir`> atomicB0mb, oh sorry
[07:45:22] <Meir`> remove the "#" from my line
[07:45:32] <Meir`> i just saw you included it in the name
[07:45:36] <atomicB0mb> yeap
[07:45:41] <atomicB0mb> :)
[07:45:42] <Meir`> my bad, sorry
[07:45:45] <atomicB0mb> np
[07:46:04] <atomicB0mb> when i get the att(name) it come with #
[07:46:29] <atomicB0mb> uhmmmmm
[07:46:38] <atomicB0mb> minus minus its not plus?
[07:47:10] <atomicB0mb> cuz in my code i use animate left: '-' + distance +'px' hopping that when its a negative "distance" it became positive
[07:47:55] <Meir`> atomicB0mb, i'm pretty convinced that the laeding minus is not necessary
[07:49:02] <atomicB0mb> well, another alternative is to SET the .position() = zero
[07:49:06] <atomicB0mb> but i dont know how to do that
[07:49:07] <atomicB0mb> hehehe
[07:49:37] <atomicB0mb> instead of animate left, i would just set the target.position() = zero
[08:09:55] <R13ose> How do I make $(window).scroll(function () { if ($(this).scrollTop() < 880) { } } so when you scroll to that section doesn't make your screen size, the animation of that section starts and not before?
[08:24:33] <decx> add you animation to a class and add that to the element and that point
[08:26:32] <R13ose> decx: how?
[08:32:08] <decx> addClass :p
[08:34:31] <R13ose> decx: I have the animation attached to a class and added that class to the div.  I am trying to show and hide the sections based on the scrolltop so the animation only happens when I have got to that section.  This is failing for some reason.
[08:35:21] <atomicB0mb> https://jsfiddle.net/wwjq8yfp/  -> Does anyone know why is not sliding?
[08:36:09] <decx> R13ose: make a fiddle
[08:36:09] <R13ose> atomicB0mb: need more details
[08:36:34] <R13ose> decx: I have a dropbox link where you can get all the files if you want that
[08:38:20] <atomicB0mb> actually the same code works here: http://www.joyncorp.com/homologacao/  ("serviços" area)
[08:38:33] <atomicB0mb> but the content slides only on the first click =/
[08:38:59] <atomicB0mb> all i want is when u click in those circles, the content above them move to their position
[08:39:04] <atomicB0mb> simple as that
[08:39:07] <decx> R13ose: too lazy for that, fiddle up ;)
[08:39:19] <R13ose> decx: this is too much to fiddle up :P
[08:39:53] <R13ose> atomicB0mb: content above or below?
[08:40:59] <atomicB0mb> im sorry, below
[08:44:38] <R13ose> atomicB0mb: not sure, for some reason moving this to the left is not working.
[08:47:19] <jop008> I have a filterable element on my page I want to show all items (reveal = false) how to do this?
[08:52:16] <jop008> this is my code http://pastebin.com/d7cQu4vZ
[08:53:00] <decx> atomicB0mb: move the wrapper not the separate element https://jsfiddle.net/decx/wwjq8yfp/1/
[08:59:11] <lsv> hey guys
[08:59:32] <lsv> if i run some code to replace a div on page, does it matter where I place the code which replaces the div?
[08:59:36] <lsv> should it always be placed after the div?
[08:59:42] <lsv> or does it matter with async?
[09:00:06] <decx> if you have a doc ready or onload then it doesnt matter
[09:00:58] <lsv> what if i don't?
[09:01:57] <decx> then it does ^^
[09:02:11] <jop008> how to activate http://api.jquerymobile.com/filterable/#option-filterReveal the search programmatically trying to show all the records
[09:04:02] <jop008> my code is activated like this   oel.on("filterablebeforefilter", function (e, data) {
[09:04:10] <jop008> but only on user input
[09:04:39] <R13ose> :(
[09:06:07] <lsv> decx - haha touche:P

[09:27:58] <R13ose> hi
[10:11:42] <R13ose> quiet room
[10:31:56] <popcorn> a regex question: i replace all urls in a text with links, but now i want to exclude urls, that start with src=", the regex i use now starts with /(\b(https?):\/\/, found 1 discussion on stackoverflow, but that didn't help me
[10:34:36] <popcorn> that's the stackoverflow discussion, but the solution didn't work http://stackoverflow.com/a/11745200
[10:50:34] <skypce> exist some difference if i run this code:         $('#hexagon-description').fadeIn().html("Access comprehensive data to identify profitable clients");
[10:50:52] <skypce> or this  : v
[10:50:54] <skypce> or this  :         $('#hexagon-description').html("Uncover where hidden risks and opportunities lie").fadeIn();
[10:51:18] <skypce> the .fadein() load first in the top example?
[10:51:58] <R13ose> skypce: I don't understand
[10:52:34] <skypce> the order of the fadein alter the way to display?
[10:52:48] <R13ose> skypce: can I pm you?
[10:52:53] <skypce> yes
[11:41:21] <rocky> hrm, i have an odd situation...  i have a little template snippet in my html that i use in jquery looping, it gets compiled with handlebars so it includes vars like {{foobar}} ... my template html contains an <img> tag like <img src="{{foobar}}" /> and my browser tries to load an image called {{foobar}} which obviously gets a 404... any common tricks for having it not load the template's img ?
[11:42:02] <rocky> i really want to keep that html snippet in the main html so that designers can tweak it without having to touch .js files
[12:25:38] <rooty_> i have a true false radio button scenario, how do I set the value of one? it could be either or
[12:30:20] <ajf-> One of my assets timing out is significantly delaying the document.ready event on my stage server (but not on production), making all the handlers that are bound to that event take a very long time to execute. Is there any way I can cap the maximum time that the browser will wait for some of the assets until it fires the event?
[12:31:09] <ajf-> I have tried $(document).trigger('ready')
[12:31:18] <ajf-> But seems like that is not allowed
[12:31:47] <mooncup> can't you just load that asset with js?
[12:32:07] <ajf-> That's too much of a refactor at this point
[12:33:38] <ajf-> $(document).on('ready failSafeReady', function() {}) ...
[12:33:53] <ajf-> that seems like a good choice
[14:29:20] <AssassinsMod> hi everyone
[14:30:42] <AssassinsMod> i was wondering if it is possible for jquery to work on an html string instead of the default document
[14:43:45] <Idel_> ...
[14:45:29] <AssassinsMod> anybody avaiable?
[15:29:13] <AssassinsMod_> is it possible to transform the data of a $.get( url, func(data....      into a dom object?
[15:35:02] <AssassinsMod_> dead silence
[15:43:13] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ sorry lots of afk
[15:43:31] <AssassinsMod_> i see...
[15:43:32] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ depends on the return data from the ajax call
[15:43:43] <AssassinsMod_> it returns a plain html
[15:44:01] <BinaryKitten> then you can do var myDom = $(data);
[15:44:10] <AssassinsMod_> D:
[15:44:20] <AssassinsMod_> and then how do i access mydom?
[15:44:30] <BinaryKitten> myDom.x
[15:44:46] <BinaryKitten> it's a jQuery object at that point
[15:44:55] <BinaryKitten> you can do everything you'd normally do
[15:45:37] <AssassinsMod_> well, i'd usually go with $("selector")..blabla
[15:46:03] <AssassinsMod_> but if i have a jquery object, is it possible to use it this way?
[15:46:51] <BinaryKitten> yes
[15:46:58] <AssassinsMod_> how? C:
[15:47:04] <BinaryKitten> myDom.find('selector').blabla
[15:47:15] <AssassinsMod_> ah
[15:49:00] <AssassinsMod_> i believe that jquery.get isn't async
[15:49:04] <AssassinsMod_> hope*
[15:51:59] <BinaryKitten> urm how do you mean
[15:52:21] <BinaryKitten> $.get is async code .. it'll trigger the call, but won't stop the next line
[15:52:32] <BinaryKitten> (non blocking)
[15:53:44] <AssassinsMod_> then if i plan on doing as you told me to, it would just return me undefined while still loading the original page
[15:55:44] <AssassinsMod_> instead of using $.getJSON(....) i had to use the $.ajax({'async': false, ...}); because otherwise the async loading would have returned null values
[15:59:41] <BinaryKitten> ?
[15:59:56] <BinaryKitten> .getJSON only gets json data and fails on other content
[16:01:34] <AssassinsMod_> what i mean is that an async function will return me a null value because it will return the value before the process of reading completes
[16:01:35] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ at this point it might be prudent to get things into a pastebin
[16:02:05] <AssassinsMod_> how do you do that pvt message?
[16:02:22] <BinaryKitten> goto site like jsfiddle.net or pastebin.com
[16:02:36] <BinaryKitten> put the content into it, the save and put the link to it here
[16:05:53] <AssassinsMod_> http://pastebin.com/JzjGziEM
[16:06:31] <AssassinsMod_> that's the principle and the same goes for the play $.get
[16:11:50] <AssassinsMod_> nvm, i solved changing default ajax options
[16:11:52] <AssassinsMod_> $.ajaxSetup({async: false});
[16:21:24] <AssassinsMod_> still when i use the element("pattern") it thinks that element is a function and returns error
[16:22:21] <BinaryKitten> ?
[16:22:27] <BinaryKitten> i have no answer to that
[16:22:35] <BinaryKitten> what is element/
[16:22:43] <BinaryKitten> and what is pattern/
[16:26:23] <AssassinsMod_> the problem is that after i do -> var test = $.get( url function( data ) { return $( data ); });            and try test("div"); it thinks that test is a function
[16:26:52] <BinaryKitten> ?
[16:26:55] <BinaryKitten> right i see the issue
[16:27:10] <BinaryKitten> $.get doesn't return the html
[16:27:42] <BinaryKitten> it's non blocking
[16:27:45] <AssassinsMod_> http://pastebin.com/bNEVsckJ
[16:27:49] <AssassinsMod_> wait what
[16:27:57] <AssassinsMod_> doesn't it?
[16:28:10] <BinaryKitten> no
[16:28:36] <AssassinsMod_> "Description: Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request"
[16:28:46] <AssassinsMod_> so i just get an xml file?
[16:28:49] <BinaryKitten> no
[16:28:54] <AssassinsMod_> xml file's string*
[16:28:59] <AssassinsMod_> mh...
[16:29:05] <AssassinsMod_> then i don't understand
[16:29:11] <BinaryKitten> it makes the request, returnoing a promise
[16:29:24] <BinaryKitten> the callback gets the html
[16:30:54] <AssassinsMod_> $.get( url, function( data ) { alert( data ); });
[16:31:09] <AssassinsMod_> by doing this i get the source of the target page
[16:31:39] <BinaryKitten> yep
[16:31:45] <BinaryKitten> because the callback function gets the code
[16:31:49] <AssassinsMod_> okay
[16:31:50] <AssassinsMod_> so
[16:31:52] <BinaryKitten> but by the time you get there
[16:32:03] <BinaryKitten> it's already moved past teh line in the original
[16:32:36] <AssassinsMod_> i can't understand where the problem is...
[16:32:55] <AssassinsMod_> i'm doing my best but i really can't understand
[16:33:06] <BinaryKitten> ok .. you say "Please go to teh shop to get me some sugar for my tea"
[16:33:25] <BinaryKitten> then before waiting for the response, you make the tea and complain it has no sugar
[16:33:36] <AssassinsMod_> ok that was clear
[16:33:37] <BinaryKitten> $.get is non-blocking
[16:33:52] <AssassinsMod_> but that's why i did put this at the beging $.ajaxSetup({ async: false });
[16:34:03] <BinaryKitten> right
[16:34:11] <AssassinsMod_> i force ajax to proceed synchro right?
[16:34:19] <BinaryKitten> ok
[16:34:42] <BinaryKitten> that wasn't in the pastebin, so the assumption was default async
[16:34:44] <BinaryKitten> ok
[16:34:49] <AssassinsMod_> yep, i'm a retard
[16:34:50] <AssassinsMod_> http://pastebin.com/4wvc80ht
[16:34:53] <AssassinsMod_> that's the whole func
[16:35:40] <AssassinsMod_> when i alert first i get the html code, the 2nd time i get an [Object] object
[16:35:42] <atomicB0mb> Is there any way to SET the .position() zero?
[16:36:50] <AssassinsMod_> it depends on what the position is caused by
[16:36:55] <AssassinsMod_> http://api.jquery.com/position/
[16:37:01] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ - working on that now
[16:37:09] <AssassinsMod_> in this example it's from parent's padding and element's margin
[16:37:17] <R13ose> hi
[16:37:19] <BinaryKitten> also - try to use soemthing other than alert - console.log for example
[16:37:28] <AssassinsMod_> i should
[16:38:06] <AssassinsMod_> anyway atomic, if you want the element at 0,0 why don't put his css "position":"absolute" ?
[16:38:29] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ - http://pastebin.com/mvMqj9eq
[16:38:53] <atomicB0mb> www.joyncorp.com/homologacao go to "serviços" area, u will see some circles, and then, their content
[16:39:22] <atomicB0mb> i want to every time the user clicks on the circle, it make the .position() of the li zero
[16:40:06] <atomicB0mb> cuz like this, it only work on the first time. But when animate ({right: distance}) dosent work anymore
[16:40:10] <atomicB0mb> its driving me crazy
[16:41:43] <atomicB0mb> the javascript: https://jsfiddle.net/2q4jvzhc/
[16:42:03] <AssassinsMod_> sorry but that's way too hard for me ;)  i just have a basic knowledge of css & js
[16:42:36] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ - do you understand what i've done for the code paste i've shown?
[16:42:48] <AssassinsMod_> trying right now
[16:43:04] <AssassinsMod_> how do you send pvt messages?
[16:43:16] <BinaryKitten> atomicB0mb - unless the name is "#something"
[16:43:20] <BinaryKitten> then it won't find target
[16:43:32] <atomicB0mb> i can find the target
[16:43:37] <atomicB0mb> and i can move it the first time
[16:43:44] <atomicB0mb> but after the first click, it became crazy
[16:45:28] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ - please don't pm
[16:45:32] <BinaryKitten> keep it here to channel
[16:45:39] <AssassinsMod_> idk how
[16:45:51] <AssassinsMod_> well anyway
[16:45:52] <BinaryKitten> you don't know how to what?
[16:46:00] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ what's the issue now?
[16:46:11] <AssassinsMod_> the same as before
[16:46:19] <AssassinsMod_> http://prntscr.com/6hb2sv
[16:46:22] <BinaryKitten> did you change the code to what i put?
[16:46:50] <BinaryKitten> because that error is from the last version, not what i updated it to
[16:47:08] <BinaryKitten> you can't call test as a function because it's not a function ... it's a jQuery object
[16:47:34] <AssassinsMod_> i'm a retard
[16:47:36] <AssassinsMod_> definitely
[16:47:37] <BinaryKitten> that's why i changed the line to console.log(test.find("div").get(0).outerHTML);
[16:47:38] <AssassinsMod_> completely
[16:47:55] <AssassinsMod_> at 00:47 am i didn't notice it
[16:48:14] <BinaryKitten> it's 23:48 here so yeah i know the feeling
[16:48:42] <AssassinsMod_> so i can't access like i would usually do with jquery?
[16:49:05] <AssassinsMod_> or instead the find works the same as $(...)
[16:50:34] <BinaryKitten> yep find is the same
[16:51:04] <BinaryKitten> basically if you did $('#id');   you could do $('#id').find('childelement-selector')
[16:51:54] <AssassinsMod_> so we just spent 1h over a  .find ?
[16:54:06] <AssassinsMod_> web programming never ends to amaze me
[16:54:10] <AssassinsMod_> thanks a lot anyway
[16:54:55] <BinaryKitten> AssassinsMod_ and the return issue
[16:55:05] <BinaryKitten> you can't return in the callback function
[16:55:13] <BinaryKitten> even if it's async = false
[16:55:48] <BinaryKitten> generally async = false is not suggested behaviour
[16:56:02] <R13ose> Code: http://pastebin.com/1090WSb1 I can't get 3rd scroll range or 5th scroll range to appear in the console.log.  Why is that?

[18:34:57] <randomguy> anyone know how to create an event that represents Ctrl+s?  I tried $.Event( 'keydown', { keyCode: 83, ctrlKey: true } ); and .trigger( 'keydown', { keyCode: 83, ctrlKey: true } ); with no luck
[18:48:45] <randomguy> nvm, was invoking the trigger with the event incorrectly
[19:19:41] <agrinb_> I want to have change class for child nodes in .timeline, $('.timeline').children() returns an array, $('.timeline').children()[0] returns the element I want $('.timeline').children()[0].removeClass('current') returns an error. $('.timeline').children().attr('class') returns only the class of the first child, can someone please explain
[19:21:01] <agrinb_> I want to use $('.timeline').children()[i] so that I can change class on .scroll()
[19:29:19] <agrinb_> got it, children().eq(i).
