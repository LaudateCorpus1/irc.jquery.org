[03:31:24] <Koopz> https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/dom_toolbar.html <- why can't i even get the easiest examples to work?
[03:32:03] <Cork> Koopz: impossible to say without seeing what you're trying
[03:32:30] <Koopz> i added a <'#custom-dt-toolbar'> to my dom
[03:32:43] <Koopz> i can see that div in my browser dev tools
[03:32:45] <Cork> make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[03:33:42] <Koopz> trying to $('#custom-dt-toolbar').html('o3o'); doesn't do crap... i'll make one...
[03:37:42] <dehiu> hello - if anyone can help, how can I inject contents of an array into a specific location within another array
[03:38:02] <dehiu> so, for example, arr1=[obj1, obj2], arr2=[obj3, obj4, obj5]. I want arr2=[obj3, obj4, obj1, obj2, obj5]
[03:39:10] <Cork> dehiu: you want splice
[03:40:38] <dehiu> yep, I think I got it
[03:44:48] <Koopz> i can't even get a datatables instance working in jsfiddle... geeze
[03:50:10] <Koopz> not even output on the console?!
[03:50:52] <Koopz> well... console.log() works but no errors showing up... the heck is going on?
[03:55:16] <Uhkis> again, show it
[03:55:54] <Koopz> ugh... of course the fiddle works
[03:58:05] <Koopz> https://jsfiddle.net/xn78t8a8/3/ <- that's what i'm trying to accomplish
[04:00:13] <Koopz> too bad that my fiddles for some reason always work compared to 'the exact same setup on what i'm actually doing'
[04:01:11] <Koopz> oh you can't be serious
[04:01:56] <Uhkis> i am serious and dont call me shirley
[04:02:10] <Koopz> hi serious i'm dad
[04:02:28] <Koopz> gotta confirm this real quick...
[04:16:14] <Koopz> yeah no i have absolutely no clue
[04:17:29] <CssNoOb> Hello
[04:17:34] <Cork> Koopz: there is one difference between when it runs in jsfiddle compared to in a normal page; jsfiddle wrapps all the scripts in onload by default
[04:17:55] <Cork> except for that if that is correct, you have a problem somewhere else in the page causing the problem
[04:18:47] <Koopz> the whole html including the js is getting loaded via ajax
[04:19:13] <Cork> so you might be running it too early
[04:19:28] <Cork> cause the dataTable needs to have the table in the page before it runs
[04:19:46] <Koopz> datatables initialization is also part of the content that gets returned by ajax
[04:20:11] <Koopz> and right under that initialization line i try to set the content of the #custom-dt-toolbar
[04:20:24] <Koopz> datatables works w/o problems
[04:20:37] <Cork> might be it is async so the element haven't been created yet
[04:20:40] <Koopz> setting the content doesn't happen
[04:21:05] <Koopz> how come this fiddle works then? :D
[04:21:18] <Cork> point taken
[04:21:29] <Cork> (didn't notice that line)
[04:22:30] <Cork> putting a breakpoint at where you run custom-dt-toolbar and starting stepping through might give an answer
[04:22:52] <Cork> though dynamic js tends to make that hard
[04:23:15] <Koopz> ...breakpoints? xD i never did live debugging on frontend
[04:23:46] <Cork> open developer tools view the source code of the script and click in the left edge of the script line you want it to break on
[04:24:07] <Cork> but like i said dynamic js tends to make that hard, as you don't have the line before or after it executed
[04:24:48] <Cork> you could temporarily move it to a static function and just call that function instead
[04:24:52] <Cork> and then put a break point there
[04:30:03] <Koopz> hmm... y'know what? i'll just add .on('init.dt', function() { }) and set the content in there
[04:30:37] <Cork> prob the way you're intended to do it
[04:33:01] <Koopz> hmm... too bad their examples don't do it like that :D
[04:33:12] <Koopz> (and still work)
[04:34:14] <Koopz> it's sad how much time i invested in this little issue
[10:02:44] <grek> Hi i try use datatables and require js - when i add library - "datatables": "https://cdn.datatables.net/v/bs/dt-1.10.15/af-2.2.0/fc-3.2.2/fh-3.1.2/kt-2.3.0/r-2.1.1/rg-1.0.0/sc-1.4.2/se-1.2.2/datatables.min", requirejs stop working Mismatched anonymous define()
[10:53:55] <poboy> ok, so I do I add a toggle where "#printhide" will show if the checkbox is checked and hide if it's not checked?  https://jsfiddle.net/gdhc5kuk/
[11:09:55] <grek> is possible to get requirejs Load timeout for modules: datatables,datatables.net-fixedColumns - path for this file ?
[11:59:51] <hanuman> Hi all, I have 5 tabs in my html loading by DT, I want to export those tables data into excel as each table data as sheet into one excel
[12:44:50] <arosen> I'm looking for an infinite scroll plugin that also handles removing elements and re-adding them when the user scrolls back up (which is needed if you have tons of items in your scroll.) Can anyone recommend one that handles that?
[12:45:06] <arosen> most seem to only handle adding elements not the removal bits.
[12:45:46] <momomo> the input.on('input', fn) ... is there a way to trigger the on input function and pass custom arguments ( the input event on another input) ? trigger('input') might work but I am not able to pass original event object to it
[12:46:31] <momomo> is there a way to get hold of the method to be triggered and call myself?
[12:48:14] <momomo> i gues maybe this works: input.trigger.call(input, 'input', arguments);
[12:48:26] <momomo> although it is giving me two event objects on the next
[12:56:46] <poboy> how do I apply the toggleclass to the closest "hideme" class?  https://jsfiddle.net/gdhc5kuk/13/
[14:05:55] <Orphis> Hi! In my app ( https://orphis.github.io/alttp_entrance_randomizer_tracker/ ), I have nested elements with each a click handler that are conflicting
[14:06:48] <Orphis> Basically, if you click on any squares on the map, it will add an entry on the first table, then you should be able to click on the X on the line to remove it, but instead it selects the line (which is supposed to happen if you click anywhere else)
[14:06:57] <Orphis> How do you usually fix those?
[15:25:30] <poboy> in my project this in a foreach loop.  How do I change this to only call .toggleClass when #viewable is set to "checked"  https://jsfiddle.net/gdhc5kuk/18/
[15:26:20] <poboy> right now it hides everything with an id of viewable if one of them changes from checked to !checked
[15:28:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[15:28:14] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[15:28:51] <robertmaxrees> second off, are these in separate TRs or what?
[15:29:35] <robertmaxrees> poboy ^^
[15:29:55] <poboy> robertmaxrees yes
[15:30:04] <robertmaxrees> so more like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gdhc5kuk/19/ ?
[15:30:28] <robertmaxrees> actually https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gdhc5kuk/20/ - this only has one copy of jquery on it.
[15:31:40] <robertmaxrees> so you'll want to change hideme to a class, first.
[15:31:41] <poboy> that looks right.  each tr has 5 td's
[15:31:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:31:59] <robertmaxrees> but how many of these combos are in each?
[15:32:24] <poboy> oh, just one
[15:32:30] <robertmaxrees> okay cool.
[15:33:03] <robertmaxrees> so I'd probably use $(this).closest('tr').find('.hideme') to get the related "hideme" element
[15:33:08] <poboy> basically i want to say if the box is checked, hide the contents of hideme
[15:33:16] <robertmaxrees> *the contents of the related hideme.
[15:33:20] <poboy> yes
[15:33:28] <poboy> right now it hides all of them
[15:33:32] <robertmaxrees> 'cause what oyu have now selects all of 'em.  so yeah, use that .closest().find() combo/.
[15:35:14] <poboy> robertmaxrees  that was what I needed!  thanks so much
[15:35:24] <robertmaxrees> yep!  do you understand what that does?
[15:36:07] <poboy> yes.  I tried closest()  but didn't realize i need to add 'tr' and .find
[15:36:56] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah
[15:37:09] <robertmaxrees> closest starts at the current element and just goes through all ancestors.
[15:37:09] <poboy> thanks for your help.
[15:37:25] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[16:06:53] <mark36ph> hi. wondering if i could get a little help please? i have some code like in the link. it is meant to show 1 drop down box. when this is filled in, the second one appears. this bit is working, but i need a 3rd one and im not sure how i do this? any help? thanks. https://jsfiddle.net/60pj2dr4/
[16:08:25] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost?
[16:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you've already got it working for one.
[16:09:14] <mark36ph> im not sure how i do it for the third one. as when i fill out the 3rd drop down box, the info from the second one vanishes
[16:09:45] <mark36ph> im not sure if thats something to do with the ajax processing?
[16:09:58] <robertmaxrees> well.
[16:10:03] <robertmaxrees> your ajax call does $("#model").html("<select>" + res + "</select>");
[16:10:27] <robertmaxrees> but none of the code here seems to show a listener for that third dropdown.
[16:10:32] <robertmaxrees> maybe you're missing some code?
[16:11:22] <mark36ph> i did have another line under that one you just said, for the third dropdown, but it didnt keep the second populated with data
[16:11:40] <robertmaxrees> could you show all the code?
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> 'cause what you've got there doesn't show anything bound to that third dropdown.
[16:13:27] <robertmaxrees> jsut to make sure I'm clear, the issue is that every time you select something under color, the model dropdown disappears?
[16:14:34] <mark36ph> yes thats right
[16:14:49] <mark36ph> i cant remember the code i had in before i removed it again!
[16:15:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:17:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something here isn't adding up.
[16:18:07] <robertmaxrees> none of what i'm seeing would cause that problem.
[16:19:11] <mark36ph> ok. https://jsfiddle.net/60pj2dr4/1/ - i select model. make appears and is populated. i select make, and it becomes un-populated
[16:20:27] <robertmaxrees> what's an example response from the server?
[16:24:12] <robertmaxrees> ah, i see.
[16:24:27] <robertmaxrees> by "un-populated" you mean "it resets"?
[16:26:17] <mark36ph> yeah it resets. it just has no data
[16:26:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:26:49] <robertmaxrees> because you're always doing $("#model").html("<select>"+res+"</select>");
[16:26:55] <robertmaxrees> within makeAjaxRequest
[16:27:35] <mark36ph> would i have to do something like if its not been changed, dont run that part?
[16:28:06] <robertmaxrees> i would modify your logic to explicitly tell it which needs to update.
[16:28:09] <mark36ph> im not great with jquery or ajax. its my first attempts at it!
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why your current code doesn't work the way you want it to though?
[16:29:00] <robertmaxrees> basically, $("#model").html("<select>" + res + "</select>"); means "replace the contents of #model with whatever came back from the server
[16:30:09] <mark36ph> ok. within the success function, would i be able to do a jquery version of php's if() ?
[16:30:20] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[16:30:25] <robertmaxrees> but I wouldn't do that honestly.
[16:31:22] <robertmaxrees> modify function makeAjaxRequest(make, model){ and tell it which dropdown to update explicitly.
[16:37:03] <poboy> robertmaxrees, so the function works as I wanted when there is a change, but on document load if the box is not checked, .hideme is still visible https://jsfiddle.net/mz1qvuko/1/
[16:37:20] <robertmaxrees> poboy right...
[16:37:37] <poboy> i tried $( document ).ready
[16:37:45] <robertmaxrees> and did what?
[16:37:52] <poboy> nothing worked at all then
[16:37:56] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:38:09] <robertmaxrees> why not have your backend output the hidden class on the elements?
[16:38:16] <robertmaxrees> instead of changing things after the page loads.
[16:40:12] <poboy> we're calling it $attachment['int_WebViewable'] == 1.  so if I have that on page load, then the function will not work when the box is clicked
[16:40:22] <robertmaxrees> poboy huh?
[16:40:41] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that means.
[16:58:16] <arosen> anyone know how I can call this destroy method here? https://github.com/luis-kaufmann-silva/jquery-p2r/blob/master/jquery.p2r.js#L129
[16:58:41] <arosen> I have $(".items").PullToRefresh() ; I want to then be able to disable that.
[16:58:58] <robertmaxrees> disable the destroy?
[16:59:18] <arosen> Sorry I mean i just want to be able to call the destory method to disable the plugin
[16:59:31] <arosen> and then i'll recreate it when i need it on the element again.
[17:00:01] <arosen> Do i need to edit the code in this file to expose the destroy method?
[17:00:08] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that.
[17:00:16] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to disable the destroy?
[17:00:32] <arosen> because it's buggy in some cases and i want to disable it from workin in those cases.
[17:00:59] <robertmaxrees> have you tried binding to whatever event is bugged and preventDefault() on that?
[17:01:02] <robertmaxrees> see if that stops it?
[17:02:39] <arosen> The problem i'm running into is when i scroll up on mobile it does not corrrectly work. I want to only allow "start.pulltorefresh" event from firing if  we are at the top of the scoll area.
[17:03:05] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  i wonder if i can do something like this?
[17:03:06] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you preventDefault on that event in those cases?
[17:03:34] <arosen> .on("start.pulltorefresh", function (evt, y){       if (!at_top) {  evt.preventDefault   })
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:03:45] <arosen> okay let me give that a shot thanks :)
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm suggesting.  see if that solves it :)
[17:13:21] <arosen> robertmaxrees:  cool, yea i just implemented that. It doesn't quite fix the issue 100% but it does cause the bug to stop.
[17:15:10] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  have you considered filing a GH issue to let them know about it?
[17:15:52] <arosen> Yea, that's probably the next step or just find another pull down plugin ;)
[17:16:07] <robertmaxrees> haha
[18:23:23] <GeekMonkey> Hy all
[18:23:52] <GeekMonkey> I am trying to substract the scroll position from the div position
[18:23:58] <GeekMonkey> I keep getting NaN
[18:26:17] <robertmaxrees> show the code?
[18:27:08] <GeekMonkey> https://pastebin.com/45tzaMnL
[18:27:52] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/offset/ -> ".offset() returns an object containing the properties top and left."
[18:28:28] <robertmaxrees> so var skylinePos = $(".skyline").offset(); is an object, not a number
[18:28:40] <robertmaxrees> try var skylinePos = $(".skyline").offset().top;
[18:30:56] <GeekMonkey> perfect that was it
[18:31:07] <GeekMonkey> THX robertmaxrees
[18:31:10] <robertmaxrees> yep
[22:48:46] <gorbypark_> Hi, I have a small problem where i set the .val of a text input box, which works, but when i click on the box, that value disapears.  https://pastebin.com/raw/EvSyMZ3h
