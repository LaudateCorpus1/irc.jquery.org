[00:03:11] <jop008> Is there a way to find x, y coordinates of top left and bottom right?
[00:03:24] <jop008> real coordinates
[00:08:24] <jop008> I'v tried this http://www.jamischarles.com/blog/find-x-and-y-position-of-an-element-using-javascript/ but 0,0 always
[00:10:21] <EdenK> http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[00:12:50] <jop008> but offset => 0,0
[00:14:49] <jop008> I tought simple x,y of an element not hard to find but it is complex
[00:15:07] <EdenK> what the problem with offset?
[00:17:02] <jop008> always getting 0,0
[00:17:20] <EdenK> show your code
[00:17:22] <jop008> also used code that traverse the dom tree
[00:18:30] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/DPJ7XScn
[00:18:49] <jop008> so with html I create a table with holds an <img
[00:19:15] <jop008> after the dom is rendered my $oel is set fine $oel[0] is also filled in
[00:19:34] <jop008> Testing in chrome

[00:22:53] <dlackili> how do i append a css stylesheet to something on button click?
[00:24:01] <dlackili> Right now my popout chat on button click creates a new window and does a whole bunch of jquery to append css stylesheets
[00:24:26] <thump_> dlackili: you add a specific class on click, and then style that specific class
[00:25:31] <dlackili> thump_: right now there are already pre existing classes made by the other css stylesheet that i want to override
[00:25:46] <VipConsult> any pointers on why this doesn't work : http://jsfiddle.net/94qYx/6/
[00:25:54] <dlackili> load on top of that and override some of the code lol
[00:27:25] <dlackili> thump_: on my site there is a popout chat button at the top right. When that button is pressed it creates a new browser window and appends 2 stylesheets
[00:27:56] <thump_> dlackili: give url
[00:28:22] <dlackili> thump_: i want to append one on top of the other 2 to override it
[00:29:25] <thump_> dlackili: delete stylesheet and it's over :-)
[00:29:43] <boytoy_> Hi, I got this fiddle to split dynamic lists into two columns -- http://jsbin.com/edisoz/1/edit -- I don't suppose there's a more elegant way of doing it?
[00:30:01] <boytoy_> * easier way, rather
[00:30:07] <dlackili> thump_: i think that stylesheet defines EVERYTHING
[00:30:23] <dlackili> yea it does
[00:31:59] <dlackili> thump_: i don't think deleting a 5000 line css stylesheet that defines the web page would be advisable rofl
[00:32:24] <thump_> dlackili: you add a specific class on click, and then style that specific class
[00:32:24] <VipConsult> any pointers on why this doesn't work : http://jsfiddle.net/94qYx/6/  ??
[00:33:03] <dlackili> thump_: will that override the existing class?
[00:33:42] <dlackili>  im so confused now
[00:33:47] <thump_> dlackili: no, because it's _specific_
[00:35:46] <thump_> dlackili: $('.foo').on('click', function() { $(this).addClass('someSpecificClass')' } ); //css: .someSpecificClass { //style me; }
[00:36:56] <mark__> http://gap.webpremiere.de/.  need something like in jquery or in javascript.please specify any idea ?
[00:38:47] <dlackili> thump_: im not trying to add a class though, im trying to override existing ones with a new stylesheet
[00:39:09] <dlackili> like what i already did
[00:39:39] <thump_> dlackili: so your question has nothing to do with jQuery, try #css
[00:44:13] <dlackili> what plug.dj did is on popout chat button click it creates a whole new browser window and appends a stylesheet
[00:44:17] <dlackili>  i want to do the same
[00:44:25] <dlackili> because that stylesheet is like the main one for the popout chat and i know if i override that css with my own i'll have my customizations back
[00:44:32] <VipConsult> any pointers on why this doesn't work : http://jsfiddle.net/94qYx/6/  ??
[00:44:40] <dlackili> thats the function that plug.dj uses and you can see the mess of jquery
[00:46:35] * thump_ is away from keyboard
[00:49:19] <dlackili> i want to write a similar function where if button is clicked it calls that function
[00:50:36] <_pash> hello I am using the typeahead.js v0.10 library. is it possible to highlight the words from beginning only?

[02:33:01] <nastyCreeper> hi
[02:33:09] <nastyCreeper> i have question about FileReader + websockets
[02:33:22] <nastyCreeper> i need to read file and send it by parts as they are read
[02:33:24] <nastyCreeper> is it possible?
[02:33:34] <nastyCreeper> all examples are saw send file in onload event
[02:33:37] <nastyCreeper> i saw *
[02:33:50] <nastyCreeper> which means it must be fully read into browser first (even if it's 20GB)
[02:34:09] <nastyCreeper> i need to send parts in onprogress event or something, how can i do that?
[02:37:28] <bealtine> cant you read the specs for filereader?
[02:37:42] <bealtine> seems like onprogress might do what you want
[02:38:42] <dan2k3k4> anyone used fancybox? I have an image that is normally 3040x2080px (or something like that, it's huge)
[02:38:49] <dan2k3k4> and I open that in a fancybox iframe
[02:39:14] <dan2k3k4> but the image loads full but I can move around the image (which is what I want to do)
[02:39:32] <dan2k3k4> I can set the image to fit but then it looks super small, it's better to load the image in full
[02:39:35] <nastyCreeper> bealtine: onprogress event is triggered, but how can i send only that part that was read?
[02:39:50] <dan2k3k4> but have the iframe code set to <div class="wrapper" style="overflow:auto"> would work
[02:39:50] <nastyCreeper> i can only use file.target or something which includes the whole file
[02:40:34] <bealtine> i'll leave that part up to you
[02:40:55] <bealtine> but i found an example in 3 clicks
[02:41:53] <nastyCreeper> bealtine: link plz?
[02:42:00] <nastyCreeper> i was unable to find example with onprogress
[02:42:09] <bealtine> do i look like google?

[02:43:11] <nastyCreeper> sorry i thought you already found example

[02:45:01] <dan2k3k4> nvm just removed the type iframe param and works a bit better but would prefer full image with overflow :/

[02:46:41] <EvilNo0B> Hi all , i need some help from php & jquery experts :D
[02:50:10] <mrHAT> is it safe/ok to do something like: <div class="displayStock<%= data['product_id'] %>">xxx</div>       $('.displayStock'+productID).text(newStock); ??
[02:52:19] <EvilNo0B> Now i'm building sort of an admin panel , its working fine etc but the problem that catches my attention is that if somebody fails to login and for example and hits F5 , it basically adds another login attempt to the database >.> tried unset all post data but that didnt help , maybe its because all the login steps are on same file ? :S or maybe there is a solution to do the steps check by javascript or somehow do something like block refresh
[02:52:19] <EvilNo0B> function , for example if u hit F5 , it wouldnt call the function again , instead it would put u back to the first stage. Now i didnt do that in different files because i want people to see the result on same page if they fail.
[02:53:50] <EvilNo0B> also cannot make a location (redirect) function on fail since than people won't see the error message (wrong username / password / etc )
[02:55:07] <EvilNo0B> mrHAT: what if somebody disable javascripts in the browser itself , will your div keep working ?
[02:55:54] <mrHAT> if they disable javascript 90% of the webpages will not work
[02:59:33] <lemonsparrow> why isnt this code working http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/egjeJ/13/ when I give insertAfter($(this).attr("id"));  ??
[02:59:49] <sammich> mrHAT is that JSP?

[04:41:21] <renan_saddam> When going $(':submit:not(.nosmartsubmit)') sometimes I get "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .nosmartsubmit" for jQuery 1.7.1 ... I dont see nothing wrong on the selector tho
[04:43:17] <ryorky1> I have and event selecter as follows:  $(".newfolder").live("click", function() {});  how can I add an event for presseng the 'Enter key into it?'
[05:02:11] <shaundunne> You want to fire the event of the enter key after a click?
[05:09:04] <shaundunne> @ryorky1 are you using an older version of jQuery, I ask because you are using .live and not .on
[05:10:38] <ryorky1> shaundunne:  I am using a slightly older version, but almost always use .on
[05:11:08] <shaundunne> OK, so you want to trigger the enter keypress event within that click function?
[05:11:46] <ryorky1> shaundunne:  no, it needs to be for either a click or a keypress
[05:12:05] <shaundunne> OK, I'll mock up a quick JSbin
[05:12:13] <ryorky1> k, tnx
[05:15:45] <nastyCreeper> is it possible to pause/continue FileReader ?
[05:18:59] <bahamas> hello. how I register an event with jquery if I add jquery at the bottom of the page? currently, $(document).ready raises an error about $ not being defined
[05:19:29] <shaundunne> http://jsbin.com/ejocas/4/edit
[05:22:37] <shaundunne> @ryorky1 - this bin shows how to trigger a jquery event on the body (such as enter) => http://jsbin.com/ejocas/4/edit , you can scope the event to any selector you like of course, such as an input
[05:24:23] <bahamas> anyone?
[05:24:37] <ryorky1> shaundunne:  I assume in the click function, you are just setting the keycode value to 13(enter) and then calling the keydown directly after that and are passing it to the keydown, am I correct?
[05:24:50] <ryorky1> by the way, nicely done
[05:25:04] <ryorky1> and tnx
[05:26:09] <ryorky1> bahamas:  can u paste code?
[05:26:40] <shaundunne> Yes, in the click function I just fire/trigger the keydown event with the keycode, then on the body I am listening for any keydown event
[05:27:09] <shaundunne> You could, if you wanted, just do an IF statement inside that to check if the keycode is the one you wanted too
[05:27:26] <ryorky1> that's what I did
[05:27:50] <ryorky1> and thanks for the code, I learned something new today, tnx
[05:28:22] <ryorky1> shaundunne:  tnx for your help

[06:39:59] <DeoSama> Hello everyone.
[06:40:58] <DeoSama> I have an ID coming through a function and I need to check to see if it is a child of a parent element (not a direct child). Is there a quick way to do this?
[06:41:21] <DeoSama> like a if(id:parent == <whatever>)
[06:42:03] <sammich> .closest('selector')
[06:42:06] <sammich> .length
[06:42:41] <sonOfRa> is it bad practice to dynamically generate my js with php and have the js generate HTML? The HTML is very dynamic, and I need a lot of information that can change at runtime...
[06:44:14] <SargoDarya> sonOfRa: Unless you're doing an adserver try something else
[06:45:03] <sammich> depends if the load on the server is worth it
[06:45:33] <sonOfRa> I have a timetable with events, and each event can last a different amount of timeslots, so the table's <td> elements are dynamically created with different rowspans and colspans
[06:45:34] <Neillithan> Hi, I'm having a problem getting Jquery to load properly for a template called ja_elastica for Joomla 2.5.   It seems to load into the head just fine, but all of my Jquery scripts that I have manually written do not work.  Can somebody help me diagnose this problem?
[06:45:53] <Jabberwock> "Do not work" ?
[06:46:20] <bealtine> not workz error...don't you know it?
[06:46:21] <DeoSama> Sammich: won't .closest('selector') only give me the direct parent? The parent I want to check for is a "grandparent" :(
[06:46:32] <Neillithan> Jabberwock: yeah, they simply do not work.  The jquery is correct, but it simply will not work.
[06:46:44] <sammich> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[06:46:44] <Jabberwock> Are you saying that they're failing silently?
[06:47:06] <bealtine> how do you know the jquery link is ok?
[06:47:24] <bealtine> sounds like it isnt
[06:47:55] <sammich> sonOfRa: but how would doing it on the server be any different to doing it on page?
[06:48:15] <Neillithan> Jabberwock: I'm not sure.  the jquery is loaded automatically from the template, and any jquery that the template relies upon works fine.  but any jquery that I manually put it do not work until I explicitly add jquery into the head.php file.  When I do this, all of my jquery works fine, but the jquery that the template relies upon stops working. lol
[06:48:15] <sonOfRa> well, the page has to have the capability to do it as well, as the items can be dragged around
[06:48:38] <sammich> if it's safe to do so, I'd offload that work to the client
[06:48:40] <sonOfRa> the first init can be done on the server I guess, but I need to keep track of which element lasts how long
[06:48:54] <Neillithan> Jabberwock: It's a mindfuck I know.
[06:48:59] <sonOfRa> so I thought I'd let the server send that all to the client, and let the client do all the work
[06:49:34] <sonOfRa> the php script just grabs things from the database and sends whatever it gets to the javascript.
[06:49:55] <sammich> I like do that stuff on one side only, since that saves me from writing the same bit of functionality twice
[06:49:59] <Gmac_> why do people use jquery mobile if u could just use media queries in css to make it look right?

[06:50:40] <arschmitz> Gmac_: jquery mobile is a LOT more then just media queries
[06:50:52] <sammich> here we go
[06:51:07] <Neillithan> Jabberwock: Can I show you the website so that you can see for yourself?
[06:51:07] <Gmac_> what is it?
[06:51:12] <sonOfRa> sammich, http://jsfiddle.net/yrLbE/23/ basically the top block of the javascript here would be "dynamic", as in created by the php script. The clientside then creates the HTML table out of that information
[06:51:38] <arschmitz> its a full javascript framework with an ajax navigation model page transitions and a bunch of widgets
[06:51:59] <sammich> really, why use any library, all they are is just a bunch of JS
[06:52:23] <Brodingo> why even build a website anyway?
[06:52:50] <sammich> hell, why do you even buy anything. You can grow/build it yourself
[06:52:57] <sammich>  /rant
[06:53:00] <Brodingo> why even live when you can just be dead
[06:53:06] <sammich> hah
[06:53:11] <Brodingo> no worries
[06:53:27] <Gmac_> ah i see so it loads each page with a swipe
[06:53:28] <sammich> you know what is the single most environmentally damaging thing you can do?
[06:53:34] <Gmac_> and it has widgets
[06:53:48] <Gmac_> but that means the site will look totally different
[06:54:00] <Neillithan> Well I guess jabberwock died.
[06:54:02] <Gmac_> from the non mobile version
[06:54:14] <sammich> raising kids /rant
[06:54:44] <Gmac_> sammich are you talking to me?
[06:54:59] <sammich> from about 15 lines up, yeah
[06:55:18] <Gmac_> haha
[06:55:27] <Gmac_> i was just asking!
[06:55:30] <Gmac_> im a newb
[06:55:37] <Gmac_> well somewhat
[06:55:51] <sammich> and I'm tired and bored. You were an easy target
[06:55:52] <Gmac_> i taught myself js and jquery and now i wanted to see what all the fuss was about
[06:55:58] <Gmac_> its ok
[06:56:01] <arschmitz> Gmac_: yes if you make two different sites one with a framework and one without they are going to look different ......
[06:56:18] <Gmac_> so i don't feel i would make use of jquery mobile
[06:56:32] <Gmac_> i like when the website looks the same across browsers and devices
[06:56:42] <luke_66> hi everyone
[06:56:44] <sammich> I built a small 3-4K line project at work with jQM
[06:57:02] <sammich> couple weeks work. Fairly easy to work with ;)
[06:57:04] <Neillithan> Okay I'll try again.  I'm having an issue with a template called Ja_Elastica for Joomla 2.5.  The template loads jquery automatically, and the template seems like all of the jquery stuff the template uses works fine.  However, when I attempt to type any jquery scripts, they do not work.  I have tested my jquery scripts, they are written correctly.  The only way I can get my jquery to work is if I manually load jquery into the head
[06:57:16] <Neillithan> However, doing this breaks the template.
[06:57:18] <Gmac_> whoa… well what did it do just display hello?
[06:57:28] <Neillithan> Can somebody help me with the above problem?
[06:57:52] <sammich> Gmac_: hmm, that wasn't within scope.
[06:57:52] <bealtine> not w/o seeing the problem really
[06:58:04] <bealtine> it not workz isnt a description
[06:58:24] <Neillithan> bealtine: is that directed towards me?
[06:58:40] <bealtine> sort of...it's general advice
[06:59:02] <sammich> noconflict?
[06:59:28] <Neillithan> bealtine: I don't know how else to explain it.  The jquery that I type literally does nothing until I load jquery into the head.php.  once I do this, my jquery works fine, however, all of the jquery that the template relied upon stops working.
[06:59:51] <sammich> Neillithan: is jQuery in noConflict mode?
[06:59:59] <sammich> as in, you use jQuery, not $
[07:00:02] <Neillithan> sammich: what does that mean?
[07:00:11] <luke_66> a question about duplicated ids: I have a page that contains a div with id="footer". Then I added a js that insert an iframe, which call an external page, and inside it there's an element <tr id="footer">. Will it be a source of troubles?
[07:00:22] <Neillithan> sammich: I use $ when I write my jquery stuff.
[07:00:25] <sammich> Neillithan: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[07:00:36] <Gmac_> if ur working with wordpress don't use $
[07:00:37] <Neillithan> sammich: Looking
[07:00:40] <Gmac_> unless you do this
[07:00:56] <Gmac_> jQuery(document).ready( function($)
[07:01:01] <sammich> luke_66: they are in different 'windows', so they won't conflict
[07:01:04] <Neillithan> Gmac_: I'm using joomla 2.5
[07:01:13] <luke_66> sammich, thanks
[07:01:17] <Gmac_> yeah well it prob has the same issue
[07:01:26] <sammich> not an issue ;)
[07:01:48] <sammich> Neillithan: in console, type jQuery (without your manual jQuery loaded in)
[07:01:51] <Gmac_> call it what u want
[07:01:53] <sammich> and press enter
[07:02:16] <Akuma> hello, I'm working on a script that types and automatically inside an input field and follows the text in the input field as it overflows past the visible part.
[07:02:19] <Neillithan> sammich: console?
[07:02:25] <Akuma> I've managed to get the first part working, which types the text automatically, however I cannot get the added text to be followed past the end of the visible part of the input
[07:02:31] <Akuma> I've tried using ajquery plugin that moves the caret to the end, but it does not move the display of the text within the input
[07:02:38] <Akuma> (the cursor is however moved to the end of the string)
[07:02:56] <sammich> Neillithan: firebug/firefox, chrome/safari Inspector
[07:02:56] <Neillithan> sammich: what do you mean by console?
[07:03:02] <Neillithan> ah.
[07:03:53] <Neillithan> sammich: Okay, I typed jquery.  I got "function()"
[07:04:25] <sammich> yeah. wordpress tends to load jQuery in noconflict mode
[07:04:40] <Neillithan> sammich: I'm using joomla, not wordpress.
[07:04:59] <sammich> in any case, it looks like jQuery is loaded in with noConflict mode
[07:05:11] <Neillithan> ah, the picture is becoming clearer
[07:05:12] <sammich> wrap your code in a closure
[07:05:35] <Gmac_> time to make breakfast
[07:05:43] <Neillithan> sammich: what do you mean by closure?
[07:05:52] <sammich> jQuery(function() { /* code */ })($), I think
[07:06:26] <Gmac_> function breakfast(eggs)
[07:06:47] <Neillithan> sammich: is there any harm disabling noconflict?
[07:07:00] <sammich> hang on
[07:07:42] <sammich> as Gmac_ said already: jQuery(document).ready(function($) { /* code */ });
[07:08:01] <sammich> if you throw your code in there, you can use $ instead, and you won't have to change your code
[07:08:11] <Neillithan> sammich: I see
[07:08:12] <sammich> leave noconflict on
[07:08:19] <Neillithan> I'll see if I can figure this out
[07:09:41] <Gmac_> smack your computer! it helps...
[07:10:17] <Neillithan> Gmac_: sammich: Thank you very much.  That solved my problem. :-)
[07:10:29] <Gmac_> the smack?
[07:10:32] <Gmac_> i told u!
[07:10:34] <Gmac_> haha
[07:10:35] <sammich> to be fair, Gmac_ brought up the solution
[07:10:44] <Neillithan> true
[07:10:45] <Gmac_> sopt im blishing
[07:10:47] <sammich> I did first suggest it was noConflict though ;)
[07:10:49] <Gmac_> blushing
[07:11:04] <Neillithan> well in any case, you both helped so thanks. :-)
[07:12:06] <Gmac_> oh crap function breakfast(eggs) returned null …i have to go and buy eggs
[07:12:48] <caitp> what is your preferred UI for inputting times
[07:13:31] <caitp> typing, a dropdown list of 30 minute intervals, several dropdown lists of unit intervals, those weird sliders from the datetime picker hack of the jquery ui datepicker. ...
[07:13:38] <fRAiLtY-> How to post the value of formData -> token in this post action? http://pastie.org/8170198
[07:14:08] <sammich> all the jQuery date/time pickers are horrible
[07:14:39] <caitp> yes, but i'm asking what you, as a user, would actually /prefer/
[07:14:48] <caitp> like, how do people even want to input times o_O
[07:14:59] <sammich> I want it to read my mind
[07:15:11] <caitp> we might have that tech soon :D
[07:15:18] <sammich> Siri, wake me up at 730am
[07:15:33] <caitp> did you see that thing about rats able to communicate impulses to each other over the internet?
[07:15:49] <sammich> trees did that first in Avatar
[07:15:52] <caitp> but i don't think it's human-ready yet :u
[07:16:41] <caitp> http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/28/us-science-brain-mindmeld-idUSBRE91R0U620130228 pretty crazy, I got super excited when I first read that lol
[07:16:44] <sammich> maybe a clock interface with draggable arms
[07:16:57] <caitp> but even that seems really inconvenient, even if it looks cool
[07:17:05] <sammich> that would be fairly usable, probably not ARIA compliant though :(
[07:17:20] <caitp> java had something like that
[07:17:21] <caitp> it was awful
[07:17:26] <sammich> probably beats clicking up and down for your minute/hours
[07:17:46] <christopherp> can someone tell me why the duration property is not working in switchClass()
[07:17:59] <sammich> toggleClass?
[07:18:14] <sammich> oh, never mind
[07:18:51] <christopherp> I use the method and add a value for duration and it does not change the animation
[07:19:15] <christopherp> objA.switchClass(oldClasses,newClasses,"11000"); is the same  as objA.switchClass(oldClasses,newClasses);
[07:19:29] <sammich> try using just the integer
[07:19:30] <christopherp> and i tried inputing the time as a number also
[07:20:59] <christopherp> it animates but it does not chang the duration of the animation no matter what number I use string or int
[07:21:16] <christopherp> I even added easing and it didnt chang anything
[07:22:41] <sammich> christopherp: try the object config instead
[07:22:58] <sammich> (class1, class2, {duration:10000})
[07:23:43] <Al1> hi guys…need help with this plugin - http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ - i get an error when adding files for the upload - "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'parseMetaData' of undefined" - tried searching through their issues on GitHub and on Stackoverflow…couldn't find much…need help with this one
[07:24:05] <christopherp> sammich: no change
[07:25:24] <obert> uhmf
[07:26:17] <sammich> christopherp: well it seems to work
[07:26:48] <sammich> can you post just the lines you have for switchclass?
[07:27:11] <christopherp> objA.switchClass(oldClasses,newClasses,"11000");
[07:27:39] <christopherp> oldClasses and newClasses are String variables with multiple classes each
[07:28:34] <sammich> and the animation works correctly, albeit the timing is always the same?
[07:29:04] <sammich> the default time is 400ms. does that seems like how long it runs for you?
[07:29:55] <christopherp> the animation runs but the duration never changes
[07:30:11] <obert> how is the path index?
[07:30:16] <obert> gee
[07:30:28] <christopherp> it seems to always use the default value and not accept my new value
[07:30:52] <sammich> okay, gonna have to go and as the obvious, is jQuery UI up to date?
[07:31:30] <obert> having /httpdocs/p/index.html with <script src="assets/js/my.js"> and having a file in p/ to be loaded, what would be the path?
[07:31:51] <christopherp> I just got it a few days ago from google APIs 1.10.3
[07:32:00] <obert> httpdocs is the root or p/..
[07:32:49] <sammich> files in the same dir are just their names src="file.jpg"
[07:33:09] <sammich> if you need to go to a parent src="../anotherfile.gif"
[07:33:29] <sammich> if you wanna go to the root just have a leading slash
[07:34:25] <obert> i hate relative urls in js
[07:35:49] <obert> thanks
[07:36:55] <sammich> it's a POSIX standard
[07:37:25] <obert> js is a bit hard sometimes for me :p
[07:38:08] <obert> dont laugh please:P
[07:39:24] <sammich> I've learned a bit of patience from a co-worker
[07:40:36] <obert> who was? Ghandi?
[07:42:34] <sammich> a programmer who doesn't like being taught a new language
[07:42:40] <hazamonzo_> Hey folks. I have a <button class="foo" data-id="something">. Im using $('.foo').click(function(){  // do something  }); How do i go about getting the data-id? I thought maybe in the // do something, it would be $(this).data('id');
[07:43:00] <sammich> that works
[07:43:07] <sammich> there's a few ways to get at it
[07:43:10] <obert> mhm
[07:43:21] <sammich> attr('data-id')
[07:43:29] <sammich> this.getAttribute('data-id')
[07:43:48] <hazamonzo_> let me double check im not doing something silly
[07:43:49] <sammich> mind you, .data() may convert your string numerals into actual numbers
[07:44:02] <hazamonzo_> (i thought it sghould work too but its been a while since i've written any jquery)
[07:44:44] <hazamonzo_> Aww well... attr('data-id') works just fine :)
[07:44:49] <hazamonzo_> Cheers sammich :)
[07:45:40] <sammich> yw
[07:48:43] <sonOfRa> can I interact with an element I just appended without an ID?
[07:49:09] <sammich> yeah, they're called 'selectors' ;)
[07:49:33] <sammich> they select
[07:49:36] <sonOfRa> oh right, I can select the last child of the element if i append
[07:49:42] <sonOfRa> i was just wondering what to select ;)
[07:49:48] <sammich> depends on your layout
[07:49:59] <sammich> if it's appended, then typically it'l be the last thing
[07:50:42] <arschmitz> sonOfRa: if your appaneding it save reference to it first then no need for a selector
[07:50:52] <arschmitz> much faster
[07:50:56] <sonOfRa> does append return what I just appended?
[07:51:03] <arschmitz> no
[07:51:10] <davezZz> $('myclass > img').remove()  that should remove just the image? if not, how do i just remove the image in that div?
[07:52:01] <sonOfRa> oh i guess I can swap them around and use appendTo instead
[07:52:22] <arschmitz> sonOfRa: yup
[07:52:23] <sammich> if you have $obj; $.append($obj); $obj.index()?
[07:55:06] <gho5t> davezZz: $('.myclass > img').remove()
[08:00:04] <davezZz> so that should just remove the image, hrm... very frustrating
[08:00:15] <davezZz> i just missed the . in typing it now
[08:02:08] <gho5t> that's what I was wondering
[08:03:53] <dave_s> When I do $('#myDiv').html(); I don't get the HTML, but instead I seem to be getting the parsed text in IE9.
[08:05:46] <dave_s> In IE10 and other browsers this isn't an issue.
[08:06:12] <sammich> dave_s: ever consider using...plain JS?
[08:06:30] <sammich> *gasp*
[08:06:59] <dave_s> sammich: No, I was under the impression jQ handled all these problems behind the scenes.
[08:11:23] <sammich> I'd test it except I don't have IE9 here
[08:11:28] <sammich> but yes, very true
[08:11:32] <dave_s> Besides, why use a library if you have to fall back to plain JS to do basic stuff, like read the inner HTML.
[08:12:13] <sammich> okay, I just made a hypocrite of myself
[08:12:14] <dave_s> Sammich: In IE10 hit F12 and Change the browser mode to IE 9
[08:12:17] <sammich> but anywho
[08:12:27] <sammich> yeah, I'm too lazy to fire up my VM
[08:13:27] <Akuma> hello, how can I send a keypress into an input field (kepress for character 'a' for example which would appear on the text field)
[08:13:53] <sammich> you can't simulate actual events
[08:14:12] <BillCriswell> Akuma: Do mean like.. $('input').val('a').trigger('keypress') ?
[08:14:31] <sammich> you can trigger events,  but you can't trigger the default user interacation events like select box clicking
[08:15:25] <Akuma> hmm, the problem I'm having right now is that I have some text on a textfield, but I wand the non visible end of string  to appear as if it were the last entered character
[08:15:34] <lhunath> can I somehow bind an event that'll trigger whenever the element is shown somehow? (ie. through .show() or .fadeIn() or such)
[08:15:56] <sammich> .show/toggle/etc will take a callback
[08:16:04] <sammich> .show(function() {})
[08:16:42] <sammich> Akuma: do you want the caret to be set to the end of the input?
[08:17:02] <sammich> I think you can set this.val = this.val
[08:17:14] <Akuma> http://jsbin.com/oqahox/1/
[08:17:18] <Akuma> this is what I have
[08:17:34] <Akuma> I have tried moving the caret to the end of the string, which it does
[08:17:42] <Akuma> but the visible position is not updated
[08:17:58] <Akuma> so the caret is at the end, but you cannot see the end of the string
[08:19:36] <sammich> hmm
[08:19:40] <BillCriswell> Akuma: So you want the input to like... scroll?
[08:19:49] <sammich> I swear I've done this before, but I've since replaced that code
[08:19:55] <Akuma> BillCriswell: yes, as if it were being typed
[08:21:05] <BillCriswell> Ah.. interesting
[08:21:32] <Akuma> I would have thought it'd be easier, but it has proven to be quite challenging
[08:21:36] <sammich> hmm, that doesn't seem to work...
[08:22:24] <Akuma> forcing the caret at the end doesn't help either as the position on the textfield is not updated until you actually press a key
[08:22:29] <Akuma> which beats the purpose
[08:22:46] <Akuma> hence my original question about simulating a keypress within a text field
[08:24:18] <sammich> this sounds like working, albeit hacky http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1962168/scroll-to-the-very-right-of-a-long-text-input
[08:24:21] <sammich> it works
[08:24:28] <sammich> but some hackery is needed
[08:24:39] <sammich> like you'll have to switch it on and off
[08:24:53] <Akuma> I'll give it a try
[08:24:57] <Akuma> thanks for the help
[08:25:03] <BillCriswell> My first thought was scrollWidth, but I don't think an input has that.
[08:25:26] <Gmac_> how can i use regex to put a . in front of every word in a string
[08:25:37] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: Don't need a regex.
[08:25:48] <Gmac_> ok
[08:25:50] <Gmac_> how
[08:26:07] <BillCriswell> sentence.split(' ').map(function(word){ return word + '.' }).join(' ')
[08:26:08] <sammich> replace(' ', ' .')
[08:26:31] <BillCriswell> That works too. haha
[08:26:38] <sammich> ;)
[08:26:40] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way with quint to wait twice in the same test?
[08:26:50] <sammich> qunit*
[08:26:55] <jeffsmykil> yup
[08:27:02] <sammich> looks like squint*
[08:27:20] <sammich> no idea, never do unit testing ;)
[08:27:34] <jeffsmykil> thank you, you have been very helpful
[08:27:45] <sammich> really need to learn the map method
[08:27:49] <Gmac_> cool let me try it
[08:28:07] <sammich> mind you, you should use regex though
[08:28:41] <sammich> because you can just use \w or whatever that whitespace charset is
[08:30:28] <Gmac_> hmmm not wokrin
[08:30:39] <Gmac_> I'm using a data-open on an html element
[08:30:46] <Gmac_> and then in there is class names
[08:30:58] <Gmac_> cata-open =" article discussion"
[08:31:12] <Gmac_> and then using jquery i slideDown on those elements
[08:31:20] <Gmac_> ugh ill jus tout a dot myself
[08:31:32] <Gmac_> ill just put a dot inside myself
[08:31:42] <sammich> sounds like you need a coffee
[08:31:49] <sammich> reads*
[08:32:21] <Gmac_> hehe...
[08:32:24] <Gmac_> and i need a comma
[08:32:42] <sammich> '*
[08:32:46] <Gmac_> I'm so cool!
[08:32:48] <Gmac_> it wokrs
[08:32:55] <Gmac_> now i don't need to make click events for anything
[08:33:04] <Gmac_> i just have one click event and anything that had dtata-open
[08:33:06] <Gmac_> opens!
[08:33:47] <Gmac_> I'm so proud of myself
[08:34:00] * Gmac_ pats himself on the back
[08:36:02] <sammich> haha
[08:36:18] <graphettion> wtf just happened?
[08:36:33] <sammich> you can freeze your tab of jsbin by typing in $($) into console
[08:36:43] <sammich> the jsbin console
[08:51:13] <BulleTTime> hi anyone knows how i can have a accordeon content not be forced to be display:none ???
[08:51:41] <BulleTTime> because there is a background progress running it should stay visible...
[08:51:59] <trewd6> $('<option />', { value: "00", text: '&#12336; SELECT CITY &#12336; ' }).appendTo(s);
[08:52:01] <trewd6> how can I evaluate the special characters in this scenario?
[08:55:57] <trewd6> helllooo??
[08:56:29] <gho5t> did you try :html
[08:56:31] <gho5t> er
[08:56:39] <gho5t> html:
[08:56:41] <gho5t> instead
[08:57:00] <grafi> wohooo wavy dash
[09:01:24] <Mr_Grim> just curious. whats the difference between .bind and .on?
[09:02:48] <Zerhackos> jquerymobile question. i dont want to have different themes for different elements e.g panels. Is there a way to define a globald default theme?
[09:03:44] <grafi> Mr_Grim i think nowadays .bind is basically an alias for using .on
[09:06:05] <Mr_Grim> ok
[09:17:07] <brombomb-w1> I'm trying to submit a table row worth of editable data, and thought I'd use serialize, but it's acting a little "funny"
[09:17:09] <brombomb-w1> http://brombomb.com/checkin/admin.php
[09:17:55] <brombomb-w1> hit the pencil icon on the last row, then use this selector in the console $('tr:last input').serialize();

[09:29:28] <maths22> I have a jquery ui related question.  Where should I ask?
[09:29:48] <okt> Are differeds the correct way to handle events requiring a specific timing?
[09:31:01] <axscode> hi guys, how can i detect of .html() of element has been updated, even with the same content?
[09:31:13] <maths22> I am experiencing the following issue; has a solution been resolved yet?

[09:31:26] <maths22> sorry
[09:33:53] <fxn> hey, I have some link decoration going on document ready, is there a way to rerun them when I replaceWith an element with some HTML retrieved with Ajax?
[09:35:16] <okt> fxn: sounds like you
[09:35:31] <okt> fxn: sounds like you are wanting to do something similar to me... http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[09:36:31] <okt> Article may be old, but I think a defferend is likely something that could get you the result you are after. I'm a bit of a noob to Jquery though so do some reading...
[09:36:41] <axscode> hi guys how can i detect if html has changed but of the same values, but dynamically changed
[09:37:52] <axscode> like if element has been this_element.html("<p>was changed but same content</p>"); how can i detect if this one called over and over?
[09:39:34] <sonOfRa> Is it possible to get the cursor position relative to the dragged element on a draggable?
[09:41:11] <sonOfRa> http://jsfiddle.net/yrLbE/33/ here I'm trying to drag arround events, and place them as they are dragged on the table, not insert the <div> directly into the droppable
[09:41:44] <Al1> ok, so i got http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ somewhat working but now getting an error when user uploads fiel, it says that it's done, but then shows an error "Error Empty file upload result" - any idea what's going on? what am i missing?
[09:42:52] <sonOfRa> for example, if A100 is dragged so it covers "B123/Monday PM - B123/Tuesday PM", I would like it placed exactly there, no matter which droppable of the 3 is targeted
[09:44:46] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/yrLbE/34/
[09:45:49] <sonOfRa> That's the mouse pointer position relative to the browser window, not the dragged element, not sure how to go from there
[09:47:19] <axscode> so change 'document' to your element
[09:48:00] <axscode> you can also get .position of your element
[09:49:20] <sonOfRa> ah, yes. Thanks!
[10:01:24] <`DiM> Hello. How to jquery post() with serialize and extra data?
[10:03:27] <lduros> hi I keep getting the following error when running jquery ui: $('elem').autocomplete() >> TypeError: this.menu is undefined in jquery-ui.min.js
[10:03:42] <lduros> the menu plugin is part of the minified script as well
[10:03:52] <lduros> any idea what the issue could be?
[10:05:13] <Danny_Joris> an iframe that doesn't have a src attribute is technically on the same server right? I have a js error in Firefox trying to do a .content() on an iframe, which doesn't have an src attribute (ckeditor)
[10:05:45] <Danny_Joris> I have this error: Error: Permission denied to access property 'ownerDocument'
[10:05:49] <tamarche> DiM: $('form').serialize() in your data object to ajax
[10:06:05] <Danny_Joris> I read that happens when an iframe is on a different server, but I don't think mine is

[10:12:48] <mweltin> was running a test today and I'm not sure why it fails.  I have 100,000 divs all with the same class name.  When I use a jquery selector I get an Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
[10:14:04] <mweltin> the model I have in my head only has one function on the stack (function called on 'ready').  So my question is what is going on with the call stack when I try to select a large number of elements?
[10:14:31] <mweltin> the code works fine for a relatively small number of div's.
[10:16:04] <grafi> without some code your question is probably useless ...
[10:16:13] <BillCriswell> Any of you guys ever try getting the "Save Image" dialog in iOS to open up programmatically?
[10:18:01] <mweltin> grafi: I have some php the generates 100,000 <div class=bindme >c</div> then my jquery is simply $('.bindme').on('click', function() { alert('blah'); });
[10:18:24] <mweltin> the code is as basic a test as I can make.
[10:18:54] <mweltin> as I mentioned this works just fine with smaller numbers of div's say 100.  It just chokes on 100,000
[10:19:11] <BillCriswell> mweltin: How about $('.container').on('click', '.bindme', function(){ alert('blah'); }); ?
[10:19:37] <BillCriswell> mweltin: Also, are you sure they're not nesting or anything like that and bubbling up the shit DOM?
[10:20:15] <mweltin> BillCriswell:  definitely not nesting.  the php is just a for loop churning out divs.
[10:20:39] <BillCriswell> mweltin: Ok. Try wrapping them all in a .container and see if delegation is nicer to you.
[10:21:32] <BillCriswell> do .container>.bindme{Testing!}*100000
[10:21:34] <BillCriswell> so*
[10:21:43] <BillCriswell> Wonder if that'll break jsbin.
[10:21:57] <BillCriswell> oh yeah, it's not liking that.
[10:23:27] <BillCriswell> mweltin: http://jsbin.com/atafip/2/edit is the basic idea.
[10:28:11] <mweltin> BillCriswell: yes that worked very well.  Would you be kind enough to elaborate on why it works?  The only thing that is clear to me now is that my conception of what is happening is totally wrong.
[10:30:04] <BillCriswell> mweltin: I'm a terrible explainer, but I'll try. With your code you're attaching the same event to 100,000 divs, with my code I'm attaching the event to 1 div and checking to see if the element that triggered it is of a certain type.
[10:30:21] <BillCriswell> attaching 1 event to 1 div.
[10:31:47] <mweltin> BillCriswell: thanks!!
[10:31:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[10:32:21] <BillCriswell> Also, events bubble up, that's an important concept to realize.
[10:32:26] <grafi> terribly good explainer

[11:05:46] <DarkGhost`> $(".moreoptions").toggle();           $("#repair-history-type options").not(".moreoptions").toggle(); how come this is not working how I expect it to? I'm expecting the options with class .moreoptions to show and hide all the other ones
[11:06:32] <QTPieMan> hey, anybody tried xojo?
[11:19:42] <fxn> hey, I have some link decoration going on document ready, is there a way to rerun them when I replaceWith an element with some HTML retrieved with Ajax?
[11:20:15] <fxn> I mean, other than manually hard-coding what has to be done in the success callback
[11:20:36] <Eiam> fxn: sure, rerun the code
[11:20:40] <Eiam> that did your link decoration =)
[11:20:56] <fxn> I have some 15 files decorating stuff
[11:21:15] <Eiam> fxn: I use an event emitter & mutation summary to fire an event whenever a DOM element a view cares about is modified
[11:21:58] <Eiam> and my view objects have a function called "enableInteraction" that will re-enable javascript on new elements
[11:22:02] <Eiam> that way the success callback doesn't have to do anything but what it normally does, is your case just call "replaceWith"
[11:22:05] <fxn> mutation summary = one single on document ready rather than many scattered?
[11:22:28] <Eiam> fxn: mutation summary is a small javascript library for watching for DOM mutations and triggering something when they happen
[11:22:38] <Eiam> fxn: https://code.google.com/p/mutation-summary/
[11:23:40] <Eiam> e.g. var observer = new MutationSummary({ callback: function(){AppController.emit("someView_didReload")}, queries: [{ element: "#someView"}]});
[11:23:56] <Eiam> whenever #someView is replaceWith'd, someView_didReload will be emitted
[11:24:27] <newbie21> hello all! I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/NdVzp/     I just want scroll down the div, What is wrong?
[11:25:16] <DarkGhost`> $(".moreoptions").toggle();           $("#repair-history-type options").not(".moreoptions").toggle(); how come this is not working how I expect it to? I'm expecting the options with class .moreoptions to show and hide all the other ones
[11:28:09] <DarkGhost`> figured it out
[11:28:09] <DarkGhost`> sorry
[11:28:52] <LindsayMac> Hye guys. I need a little push in the right direction. I have a simple little 'tabbed interface' i made but I didn't make it with using multiple tabbed blocks on one page.
[11:29:23] <LindsayMac> I COULD use an existing one but was wondering if there was an easy way to make this work with multiples instead of going back and trying to use a big bulky tab plugin
[11:29:23] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/kRLHn/2/
[11:33:40] <Eiam> LindsayMac: use bootstrap tab view?
[11:33:45] <Eiam> no javascript involved
[11:33:47] <LindsayMac> eLenoAr:  no
[11:33:54] <LindsayMac> i'm not using bootstrap
[11:34:02] <LindsayMac> i just have a simple little jquery script i'm running
[11:36:03] <DarkGhost`> why when i do .val(15
[11:36:12] <DarkGhost`> on a option in a select, it does not allow me to change it
[11:38:35] <LindsayMac> Eiam: did you not see the fiddle i posted/
[11:38:36] <LindsayMac> ?
[11:38:59] <blindMoe> DarkGhost`: what do you mean?
[11:39:11] <blindMoe> you just want to change the value of the <option> or set that option to selected?
[11:39:14] <Eiam> LindsayMac: I'm not looking at it.
[11:39:20] <LindsayMac> ok then..
[11:39:24] <LindsayMac> nevermind
[11:39:56] <Eiam> LindsayMac: I gave you the answer I was willing to give for free of my time. If you don't like that answer, thats fine. I suggest you wait for someone else, or continue to investigate the problem on your own. Sorry it wasn't helpful.
[11:40:07] <DarkGhost`> sorry blindMoe what is actually happening is im checking if .bla:selected than hide options and show new options, but for some reason even after I hide .bla it still triggers that if that it is selected
[11:40:23] <LindsayMac> yea. In fact, you were the opposite of helpful.
[11:40:57] <LindsayMac> I'll ask again to those willing to take a look.. I need to figure out to to reconfigure my script to work fo rmultiple instances of tab blocks. I have my fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/kRLHn/2/
[11:41:05] <_jo_> What's the difference between a CNAME and an ALIAS?
[11:41:23] <blindMoe> darkc0met: interesting.. would probably need to see a fiddle of that to help
[11:41:31] <LindsayMac> I have my head wrapped around the issue, but I can't seem to figure out the best way to make sure to trigger the ":first" on the first of it's "group" and not the first of everything i uess
[11:41:38] <_jo_> I have an ALIAS which points foo.bar.com to bar.com.
[11:41:55] <_jo_> And I can't seem to make it resolve foo.bar.com correctly.  Am I just not waiting long enough?
[11:42:11] <LindsayMac> _jo_:  not exactly a jquery question but..
[11:42:11] <motka> anyone seen the new infamous $.hammer() jQuery plugin?
[11:42:22] <_jo_> Whoops.  Derp.  You're right.
[11:42:27] <_jo_> Wrong room.  My fault.
[11:42:29] <LindsayMac> http://blog.dnsimple.com/zone-apex-naked-domain-alias-that-works/
[11:42:36] <LindsayMac> _jo_: ^
[11:42:47] <_jo_> Thanks!
[11:42:48] <iredmedia> Linds, you want to be able to create multiple instances of your Tabber?
[11:42:55] <blindMoe> motka: you mean hammer.js ?
[11:42:56] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  yea.
[11:44:04] <motka> nah..
[11:44:06] <motka> something similar
[11:44:08] <Eiam> LindsayMac: I'll be sure to try and be more helpful to you in particular in the future. sorry It was so disappointing.
[11:44:08] <motka> http://nadrealno.net/hammer
[11:44:28] <iredmedia> In order to do that, you want to return this.each for your jquery selector so it works like a normal jquery plugin. If you look at most plugins, all their logic is enclosed in a this.each(function(){....}). no direct reference to any $('selector')
[11:44:33] <LindsayMac> Eiam:  i dont care if you're helpful to me but the answer "use bootstrap" is stupid.
[11:44:45] <LindsayMac> AHHHH iredmedia ok
[11:46:04] <lduros> in jqueryUI I'm trying to remove the ?term= when using $elem.autocomplete({source:remote-source/}); with a remote source, since the term is applied as /my-term/ rather than ?term=my-term. Anyone ran into this? thanks
[11:46:51] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  I'm going to play with that now. I'm kinda new to JS as a whole (i am a php dev mostly) so it will take a little mind bending for me to get there, but knowing the concept is half the battle
[11:47:06] <iredmedia> No worries, I know exactly where you're coming from.
[11:47:12] <grafi> good luck LindsayMac
[11:47:22] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  thanks...
[11:47:35] <iredmedia> The issue is that people think that getting it done is more important then learning how it works. Good for you for taking the time to learn.
[11:47:35] <LindsayMac> p.s iredmedia thanks for NOT telling to use bootstrap
[11:47:46] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  :)
[11:48:07] <Eiam> LindsayMac: I didn't say "use bootstrap" I said "use bootstrap tabview?" which I then followed up indicating it didn't have any "heavy tab plugin" because it uses data-toggle. It's not a hard jump to think "oh, maybe I should try that technique, that doesn't require any javascript and is light weight"
[11:48:13] <Eiam> but I guess I'll just have to think the whole thing through for you.
[11:48:28] <LindsayMac> EXCEPT..
[11:48:31] <LindsayMac> Eiam ..
[11:48:43] <LindsayMac> that using bootstrap as a WHOLE is a crap ton more code than my 8 lines of JS
[11:48:45] <LindsayMac> so no.
[11:48:53] <LindsayMac> and its NOT an answer to a question that was asked.
[11:49:20] <Eiam> LindsayMac: jesus christ you aren't reading what I said at all. its a few lines of CSS and 3 DOM elements to implement the same thing yourself
[11:49:22] <LindsayMac> To have to include a chunk of bootstrap just so I could use the tabs is ridiculous
[11:49:23] <Eiam> no javascript at all.
[11:49:43] <LindsayMac> Eiam:  you, my friend, are useless as a "helper"
[11:49:52] <LindsayMac> you arer the one not listening to what I am saying
[11:50:12] <LindsayMac> you're telling me to include all of bootstrap required to get the tabs to work.. when all i need is 8 lines of js for mine to work
[11:50:24] <BillCriswell> Whoa hey everyone, simmer simmer.
[11:50:28] <Eiam> mkay. you've already decided my solution involved bringing the bootstrap stack in to solve your problem when I was merely pointing at a component of bootstrap to implement a javascript less tab view
[11:50:38] <Eiam> LindsayMac: again, you are completely 100% failing to read anything.
[11:50:46] <LindsayMac> Eiam:  you're the one not reading
[11:51:00] <Eiam> LindsayMac: I've read what you are saying, you keep repeating the same wrong stance I've already pointed out is not what I was saying twice
[11:51:00] <LindsayMac> You need to use bootstrap to USE bootstrap
[11:51:04] <LindsayMac> components
[11:51:07] <Eiam> LindsayMac: wow.
[11:51:23] <LindsayMac> forget it. youre wasting MORE of my time
[11:51:27] <LindsayMac> so i'm done with you
[11:51:30] <LindsayMac> your answer wasn't an answer.
[11:51:39] <Eiam> LindsayMac: no, you do not, holy shit. its just some css & html. you can go copy the line of CSS and HTML and it;'ll work the same for you as it does for them.
[11:51:50] <Eiam> yes, it was, it just wasn't the answer you wantd.
[11:51:59] <LindsayMac> No
[11:52:00] <LindsayMac> it wasnt
[11:52:08] <LindsayMac> my quesiton was.. HOW DO I TAKE WHAT I HAVE AND MAKE IT WORK
[11:52:17] <LindsayMac> not to use an entirely different approach
[11:52:25] <LindsayMac> because again.. you don't know anything about the project scope
[11:52:28] <Eiam> LindsayMac: I've put you on ignore. you are wrong, you have not read anything. I gave you an option to part of the problem you mentioned, you didn't like it. thats fine. bye
[11:52:32] <LindsayMac> lol
[11:52:40] <LindsayMac> forget it. Useless
[11:52:57] <Eiam> fxn: did that work?
[11:54:36] <LindsayMac> bootstrap uses a bootstrap-tab.js btw for anyone interested. Its not as simple as copying a few lines onf CSS http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs
[11:55:41] <iredmedia> Yeah, i dono what that was all about… you can't just add classes and data-attrs and have something work
[11:55:56] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  ok thanks. I was starting to feel like I was crazy or soemthing
[11:56:14] <LindsayMac> thanks. I'm thinking to myself.. No.. I am pretty sure I know exactly how bootstrap works....
[11:56:17] <iredmedia> it requires JS. plain and simple. The best retort to these issues is "i want to learn to do this by hand" something most of these 'awesome' web developers can't do.
[11:56:26] <iredmedia> yeah. annoying.
[11:56:28] <LindsayMac> but then I second guess becuse for some reason I feel like people in here always know more than me
[11:56:32] <LindsayMac> which is not the case apparently.
[11:56:33] <LindsayMac> lol
[11:56:41] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  again.. appreciated
[11:56:57] <LindsayMac> and I just wanted to verify to myself i wasn't an idiot.. lol by looking at boostrap itself
[11:58:05] <fxn> Eiam: the page has to be portable, that lib does not seem to work with IE, I think I am going to encapsulate what needs to be done somewhere
[11:58:54] <okt> If I wanted to target a paragraph block in a classed div would I use $('.divClass').children('p') or is there a better way?
[11:58:58] <iredmedia> LindsayMac: nope, you're not an  idiot :P. You do require JS to use 'components'.
[11:59:13] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  lol thanks! I needed the validation! haha
[11:59:25] <fxn> this is really dirty, by luck I believe I can isolate decoration in those particular nodes, but if I had global decoration it would become really ugly
[11:59:36] <iredmedia> haha don't we all :P
[11:59:43] <Eiam> fxn: oh, yeah its a wrapper for mutation observers
[11:59:44] <LindsayMac> :)
[11:59:45] <iredmedia> you can message me if you need help at any point.
[12:00:02] <LindsayMac> So.. I'm looking at your response and just trying to decide how to put that into practice here ;)
[12:00:15] <RocketCoindexter> I am trying to slide out a section at the same time slide in a new section, does anyone know where I can get a good code example of this?
[12:00:20] <fxn> maybe I define a custom event and scope the decoratos, what a mess :(
[12:00:33] <Eiam> fxn: which are in IE11
[12:00:36] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  you're trying to trigger one animation after triggering another?
[12:00:43] <Eiam> fxn: you can write them yourself, there are some docs here, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver but I ended up using mutation summary as a soft wrapper because the observers were being a pain in the ass.
[12:01:18] <RocketCoindexter> correct, when you get to my page, there is info that should stay on the page for 5 seconds, and then after 5seconds have passed
[12:01:26] <RocketCoindexter> a new bit of information replaces the old information
[12:01:36] <iredmedia> @LindsayMac hahaha so the idea behind it is, when you call $('.selector').myPluginName() it should iterate through your selected objects, and apply whatever logic is required. Check this http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[12:01:39] <RocketCoindexter> and continue this cycle for 3 sets
[12:01:58] <RocketCoindexter> LindsayMac: does that make sense?
[12:02:10] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  it probably will after I read through the docs and let it seep in a tad
[12:02:24] <enginpost> I am working on a jQuery plugin that helps load all sorts of extra data in XML into a Google Maps callback and I am getting an "Out of stack space" error in IE. Is this the place to look for advice?
[12:02:26] <Eiam> fxn: yep or that. bummer
[12:02:27] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  you want it timed and then stop after a certain amount of loops?
[12:02:58] <RocketCoindexter> not stop, just rotate back to beginning at the end
[12:03:01] <iredmedia> Good luck :)
[12:03:07] <LindsayMac> iredmedia:  thanks
[12:03:21] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  you're going to want to use a callback function.. like "after this is finished, run this"
[12:03:28] <RocketCoindexter> so I will have #post1, #post2, #post3
[12:03:50] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  can you get some code into jsfiddle.net ?
[12:04:01] <RocketCoindexter> yep, one second
[12:04:04] <tw2113> for a second i thought i was in #wordprss
[12:04:08] <tw2113> wordpress even
[12:04:17] <LindsayMac> lol tw2113
[12:04:18] <LindsayMac> hi
[12:04:21] <tw2113> hola
[12:08:09] <RocketCoindexter> LindsayMac http://jsfiddle.net/RBJ9S/
[12:18:36] <alainus> how can I add a script tag with jquery.append? I'm trying every hack I've found online but it just doesn't show.
[12:18:51] <RocketCoindexter> LindsayMac any luck?
[12:19:26] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  sorry.. was working on my issue atm
[12:19:39] <RocketCoindexter> got ya ok
[12:20:23] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  you dont even have a normal slide out function working
[12:20:46] <RocketCoindexter> right, I am not sure if it needs slide out, originally I had fade out
[12:21:01] <LindsayMac> well whatever.. you should have your animations all set in JSfiddle
[12:21:09] <LindsayMac> you can always change the TYPE of animation later, but have something there to work with
[12:21:14] <LindsayMac> what you have is just.. well.. not much
[12:21:34] <RocketCoindexter> ok, well it is just an example
[12:21:42] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  work on making ONE of your elements move, and then we can talk about the delaying / looping
[12:21:54] <RocketCoindexter> What I need help with is getting the
[12:21:57] <RocketCoindexter> … ok
[12:22:22] <LindsayMac> You need help getting things to happen in order.. right?
[12:22:30] <LindsayMac> so get the animation working and we can go with the next steps
[12:22:47] <LindsayMac> even if its just a demo animation / etc
[12:22:52] <RocketCoindexter> ok I will do that right now
[12:22:53] <RocketCoindexter> thanks
[12:22:58] <LindsayMac> (just make sure you want to use a jquery animation and not animating CSS styles)
[12:23:04] <LindsayMac> pick one or the other to be sure
[12:23:06] <LindsayMac> no prob
[12:23:12] <LindsayMac> just makes it easier to help i you have that done
[12:24:24] <c00kiemon5ter> [offtopic] has anyone used stacktable.js ? how does one theme the product ? no classes are kept :/
[12:26:32] <enginpost> would anyone have a moment to take a look at some query with me? I am having an Internet Explorer problem.
[12:26:38] <enginpost> query i mean
[12:27:07] <enginpost> jquery
[12:27:08] <grafi> which version of internet explorer
[12:27:16] <enginpost> any at this point
[12:27:30] <enginpost> grafi: I am testing in 10 at the moment
[12:27:33] <tw2113> IE is an issue, yes
[12:27:38] <enginpost> but I have tested back to 8
[12:27:59] <grafi> tw2113 the issue is people using IE
[12:28:02] <enginpost> may I share the link?
[12:28:13] <grafi> go for it
[12:28:13] <tw2113> it's a multidimensional array of issues
[12:28:49] <enginpost> load this up in firefox or chrome please: http://www.princeton.edu/~stephenm/geocode/jQMaps/
[12:28:54] <okt> 30% of my projects traffic is IE8. Welcome to my hell.
[12:28:58] <enginpost> so you can see what I am doing
[12:29:06] <grafi> poor you okt
[12:29:42] <enginpost> The plugin I am writing lets you tell it which div will contain the google map and the name of your XML file
[12:29:57] <enginpost> as you can see it runs flawlessly in Firefox and the like
[12:30:18] <enginpost> in IE after the XML loads I am getting this error
[12:30:34] <enginpost> "Out of stack space"
[12:30:38] <c00kiemon5ter> if ($browser == /IE*/) huge-non-closeable-popup-about-downloading-and-using-better-software();
[12:31:05] <enginpost> it seems to be coming from jQuery but I can't trace back to what the problem actually is
[12:31:12] <grafi> yeah im getting the same error enginpost
[12:32:11] <LindsayMac> enginpost:  have you used the chrome debug tools?
[12:32:24] <grafi> in IE?
[12:32:24] <LindsayMac> you can set a breakpoint in your code to figure out where things are happening
[12:32:38] <LindsayMac> No in chrome.. but you can still trace the code.
[12:32:45] <enginpost> I have stepped through the code in each browser
[12:32:53] <LindsayMac> Usually that error means a loopthat is getting hung up that FF steps out of but IE doesnt
[12:32:55] <enginpost> if you look in the plugin file
[12:32:57] <LindsayMac> hm
[12:33:00] <enginpost> let me get the address for that
[12:33:22] <enginpost> view-source:http://www.princeton.edu/~stephenm/geocode/jQMaps/jqmaps.js
[12:33:26] <enginpost> whoops
[12:33:34] <enginpost> www.princeton.edu/~stephenm/geocode/jQMaps/jqmaps.js
[12:33:51] <enginpost> look for this line: jQuery.fn.buildGoogleMap
[12:34:24] <enginpost> If I breakpoint early in IE 10, I can step all of the way down to  the line
[12:34:42] <enginpost> if( mapZoomFit ) thisMap.fitBounds( mapBounds );
[12:35:00] <enginpost> which is basically the end of the plugin code
[12:35:07] <enginpost> the code in there calls all of the other code
[12:35:08] <LindsayMac> weird
[12:35:20] <enginpost> then query goes on to do something
[12:35:30] <enginpost> I have no idea what, and eventually it says
[12:35:35] <enginpost> "Out of stack space"
[12:36:06] <enginpost> but I am not asking query to do anything else so it must be some async function in jquery for IE
[12:36:18] <enginpost> but I can't seem to figure it out
[12:36:24] <enginpost> and it is never in the same spot in code
[12:36:39] <LindsayMac> Oh man.. I wish I could help, but this is over my paygrade.. lol
[12:36:40] <enginpost> it just seems to randomly run out of memory at some point in some crazy query loop
[12:36:56] <enginpost> is there a forum for this sort of thing?
[12:38:23] <LindsayMac> enginpost:  well stackexchange would help
[12:38:28] <LindsayMac> or here.. to be honest
[12:38:58] <enginpost> Lindsaymac: thanks. I guess I will go hit up stackexchange
[12:39:08] <LindsayMac> sxchg is good for this kinda stuff really
[12:39:36] <Vorspire> what's the issue?
[12:39:42] <enginpost> so frustrating that it works everywhere but IE and IE is basically unhelpful in parsing what it really going wrong
[12:40:16] <BillCriswell> Internet Explorer is being mean.
[12:40:21] <LindsayMac> Vorspire:  scroll up?
[12:40:33] <Vorspire> I joined half way through.
[12:40:41] <LindsayMac> oh
[12:43:05] <enginpost> wow
[12:43:15] <enginpost> is there a version of query that works best with IE?
[12:43:20] <enginpost> could that be the problem?
[12:43:39] <BillCriswell> enginpost: What are you currently using?
[12:44:15] <BillCriswell> 1.x works in old IE, 2.x works in ie9+
[12:44:15] <enginpost> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[12:44:25] <BillCriswell> ah ok 1.10.2
[12:45:59] <BillCriswell> enginpost: Did you say IE10?
[12:46:10] <BillCriswell> Did you try an earlier version?
[12:47:22] <BillCriswell> Ha, pretty damn clever: https://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions
[12:49:20] <enginpost> I think I might start by swapping out for an older version
[13:01:19] <newbie21> Hello all! I have this: http://phpterm.sourceforge.net/     I have the text output in that textarea. I want get that text and print with colors inside another div. Thera are some jquery project who colorizes that kid of output?
[13:04:20] <BillCriswell> newbie21: Syntax highlighting?
[13:04:39] <newbie21> BillCriswell: Yes! :D
[13:05:10] <newbie21> BillCriswell: It's something like this: http://terminal.jcubic.pl/    But I just want apply syntax highlighting, because I already have the terminal application.
[13:05:31] <newbie21> BillCriswell: It's a bash simulator
[13:05:56] <Shibby> Hey everyone, new to jquery and need some guidance for my issue. I want to use jquery to send commands to a remote server, and based on those commands the server will send a specified file. Is this possible/do-able with jquery?
[13:06:12] <BillCriswell> newbie21: http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/brushes/bash.html maybe?
[13:06:19] <LindsayMac> Shibby:  you want to use ajaz?
[13:06:22] <LindsayMac> ajax?
[13:06:35] <khmer> ajaz
[13:06:40] <khmer> cajun ajax
[13:06:49] <LindsayMac> lol
[13:06:51] <Shibby> If that's a good method, yes.
[13:06:54] <BillCriswell> ajazz, the birth of cool
[13:07:41] <BillCriswell> Shibby: Absolutely.
[13:09:56] <Shibby> Are there some function calls I should look into? Everything I've seen uses examples of asking for specific files and directly downloading them to the browser.
[13:10:24] <BillCriswell> Shibby: You'd want to look at $.get() most likely.
[13:10:55] <BillCriswell> You can do like $.get( fileNameVariable, function(contentOfFileNameVariable){ $('body').append( contentOfFileNameVariable ); })
[13:11:16] <santiissopasse> is it still kosher to define the "success" setting in an Ajax call? I'm seeing that jqHXR.success() is depreciated but I don't know if that's the same thing
[13:11:18] <okt> How would I hide a div while maintaining it's block-level spacing?
[13:11:27] <BillCriswell> or $.get( 'file.php', { file: fileNameVarable }, function(content){ ... });
[13:11:38] <BillCriswell> okt: visibility hidden
[13:11:49] <okt> right... :)
[13:12:31] <BillCriswell> okt: visiblity: hidden; is basically like setting the opacity to 0. while display: none; is like taking it out of the document completely.
[13:12:51] <Shibby> Awesome, I think that's what I'm looking for! However, what if the file is a binary? As in.. I can't append the contents to anything since they'd be nonsense
[13:13:01] <newbie21> BillCriswell: Really thanks!! I'm applying now at terminal to test! :D
[13:13:13] <okt> BillCriswell: Yes, brain-fart over here... I'll blame it on IE.
[13:13:23] <BillCriswell> Good call.
[13:13:25] <okt> BillCriswell: Thanks
[13:13:37] <Silox|> Hello there! What is the difference between .on('scroll', fn()); and .scroll(fn()); ?
[13:13:45] <Silox|> Except the jquery version that ist
[13:13:47] <Silox|> is *
[13:15:18] <BillCriswell> Silox|: Same enough.
[13:15:36] <Vorspire> ?scroll
[13:15:36] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[13:16:04] <Silox|> So there is no reason one should use the .on(scroll, ... ?
[13:16:30] <Vorspire> unless you're invoking dynamically with a variable as the event identifier, no
[13:16:48] <BillCriswell> Shibby: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2523355/jquery-ajax-can-my-server-return-a-blob-of-data might help. I never tried to do it.
[13:17:46] <DarkGhost`> http://privatepaste.com/6420b69b40 for some reason even after i set .val() it still says .showoptions:selected.
[13:18:08] <Shibby> BillCriswell: Perfect, thanks for the helpful link. I'll get to work!
[13:18:18] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[13:18:44] <enginpost> finally solved my IE problem
[13:18:53] <BillCriswell> enginpost: What was it? I was curious
[13:18:56] * Vorspire cheers *
[13:19:07] <enginpost> in the end it was actually a type mismatch for XML
[13:19:28] <BillCriswell> Sounds like a blast.
[13:20:05] <enginpost> most of the work the plugin does is to load the XML to add data to a Google Maps marker (converting the XML into JSON so I can make displaying data awesome)
[13:20:25] <RocketCoindexter> I am trying to cycle through some divs on my page, does anyone have some good code example on how to do this, using jquery
[13:20:54] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: What do you get when you do $(".showoptions:selected").length ?
[13:20:55] <enginpost> and jquery needs to "get" XML data as "text" in IE so it can load it into an ActiveX.XMLDOM
[13:21:27] <enginpost> cycle through as in $("div").each( … ); ?
[13:21:29] <NoiseEee> $('div').each(function(count,element) { //element represents your div, use $(element) to get jquery methods on it });
[13:21:51] <NoiseEee> @ RocketCoindexter
[13:22:48] <RocketCoindexter> is .each a cycle method?
[13:22:52] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  i thought youw ere writing your jsfiddle
[13:23:02] <BillCriswell> RocketCoindexter: What do you mean by "cycle method"
[13:23:08] <BillCriswell> Do you want to make a slideshow or carousel thiing?
[13:23:09] <RocketCoindexter> i was trying, and couldn't get it built out in jsfiddle
[13:23:12] <NoiseEee> RocketCoindexter: if only there was a way to find more information about 'each'!
[13:23:14] <RocketCoindexter> so I just kept hacking away
[13:23:27] <RocketCoindexter> lol, got ya… I will look it up
[13:23:36] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  huh?
[13:23:44] <BillCriswell> http://www.shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[13:23:47] <LindsayMac> you couldn't get a simple animate function to work? with simplified HTML?
[13:23:58] <RocketCoindexter> LindsayMac: oddly enough
[13:24:15] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  then there's some additional issues here at play
[13:24:16] <RocketCoindexter> I was obviously doing something wrong, and I know I have query working on my local
[13:24:30] <RocketCoindexter> any suggestions?
[13:25:14] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  try and get animation working on your JSfiddle is myt suggestion
[13:25:23] <RocketCoindexter> ok
[13:25:26] <LindsayMac> but forget abotu what you have on your dev server and just make something simple from scratch
[13:25:33] <LindsayMac> using the docs and demos in the docs
[13:25:56] <RocketCoindexter> *thumbs up*
[13:27:01] <DarkGhost`> BillCriswell 0
[13:27:57] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: Put the .length part in the if
[13:28:03] <DarkGhost`> ok
[13:28:04] <DarkGhost`> thank you
[13:28:48] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: http://jsbin.com/iwocep/1/edit
[13:30:09] <RocketCoindexter> LindsayMac so based on http://jsfiddle.net/s3NrE/ why is the basic query not working, what am I missing?
[13:30:27] <RocketCoindexter> ohhh
[13:30:29] <RocketCoindexter> nevermind
[13:30:32] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  class versus IS
[13:30:33] <LindsayMac> ID
[13:30:37] <RocketCoindexter> lol, yep
[13:30:45] <Trying_> Hello everyone
[13:31:13] <Trying_> When I change the text in a textbox, for some reason my whole JavaScript is executed again
[13:31:18] <Trying_> Does anybody know why this happens?
[13:31:31] <LindsayMac> let's consult the crystal ball of code...
[13:31:40] <NoiseEee> you've probably got an event handler on the textbox?
[13:31:46] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter: so you want all to be hidden and to have each one fade in at a time?
[13:31:52] <Trying_> I do, I'm handling the 'change' event
[13:32:03] <RocketCoindexter> correct
[13:32:04] <boytoy_> Hi, do I really need jQuery UI Resizable to make this truncation responsive? http://jsbin.com/okahum/23/edit
[13:32:09] <RocketCoindexter> cycle through the 3
[13:32:54] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Try it and see. I'm willing to bet yes.
[13:32:59] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter:  is there a reason you aren't using something already existing?
[13:33:12] <RocketCoindexter> I don't know of something
[13:33:16] <Trying_> NoiseEee: I've also got the e.PreventDefault(); method inside the handler, I thought this should stop this from happening
[13:33:18] <LindsayMac> really?
[13:33:26] <LindsayMac> you can't find a single slideshow script for jquery?
[13:33:34] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: It's working, I was just hoping there was a pure jQuery way of doing it
[13:33:42] <RocketCoindexter> slideshow for text?
[13:33:56] <LindsayMac> for anything.. but sure.. for slideshow text
[13:33:58] <boytoy_> haha
[13:33:58] <RocketCoindexter> is there on that you recommend?
[13:34:01] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: You can download a custom jQuery UI build and try to only get the resizable stuff going on.
[13:34:15] <boytoy_> every day there's at least one guy in here looking for a slideshow plugin :)
[13:34:32] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: Yup, that part is a blessing!
[13:34:34] <RocketCoindexter> yea.. I get… I'm stupid
[13:34:45] <LindsayMac> boytoy_: lol
[13:35:05] <LindsayMac> RocketCoindexter: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+slideshow&l=1
[13:35:49] <NoiseEee> Trying_: recreate on jsfiddle...
[13:36:01] <Trying_> NoiseEee: Will do, just a sec
[13:41:21] <Trying_> NoiseEee: Everything works as expected on JSFiddle, yet my local version executes all the JavaScript again after pressing enter in the textbox
[13:42:22] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: http://jsbin.com/oboviz/1/edit weee
[13:42:37] <mhahn> what event should i bind to to append something to an element when it gets added to the DOM?
[13:43:24] <LindsayMac> if i understand... you want to add something after something else is added mhahn?
[13:46:48] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: wuz that?
[13:47:16] <BillCriswell> You have to click "run with js"
[13:47:23] <BillCriswell> not sure why it's not working when the link is clicked
[13:47:44] <BillCriswell> It's what you're doing ( almost ) but without a lot of the JS
[13:48:03] <boytoy_> god damn
[13:48:30] <BillCriswell> With some styling it might get pretty close.. unless there's like long words
[13:48:42] <BillCriswell> Unless...
[13:48:53] <mhahn> LindsayMac: yes
[13:48:57] <BillCriswell> Eh nevermind.
[13:49:24] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: that jsbin is a classic man
[13:49:31] <boytoy_> great work!
[13:49:38] <boytoy_> unless what? :)
[13:49:54] <BillCriswell> I was going to try to improve it, but I'm too lazy at this point in time
[13:50:45] <boytoy_> well there are many remedies for laziness
[13:51:26] <NoiseEee> Trying_: put a break point, follow the code!
[13:51:51] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: I've tried them all haha
[13:52:56] <BillCriswell> I think I just hate my job.
[13:53:09] <BillCriswell> "It's not that I'm lazy, Bob. It's just that I don't care"
[13:53:43] <LindsayMac> don't hate..
[13:53:58] <newbie21> BillCriswell: That Syntax hightlighter it's what I need, but that project only put colors at bash script, and I need that with bash output :(
[13:54:04] <Trying_> NoiseEee: Thanks for the tip. Seems like pressing Enter while the textbox has focus just reloads the page, every time
[13:54:14] <BillCriswell> newbie21: Not sure JavaScript is what you'd need then.
[13:54:26] <NoiseEee> Trying_: its probably submitting your form, yes?
[13:54:27] <BillCriswell> LindsayMac: Easier said than done!
[13:54:39] <LindsayMac> there is no try. ONLY DO!
[13:54:45] <BillCriswell> e.stopPropagation(); mayhaps.
[13:55:13] <Trying_> NoiseEee: might be doing that in the background? I actually didn't specify a form in the HTML, just an input field
[13:55:13] <BillCriswell> mayhaps is a weird word.
[13:55:30] <BillCriswell> Trying_: I think there's a lot you're not telling us.
[13:55:38] <BillCriswell> We have ways of making you talk.
[13:55:42] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ Trying_
[13:55:55] <Trying_> NoiseEee: Is that my problem? Does every textbox need to be surrounded by form?
[13:56:02] <NoiseEee> Trying_: no, not at all.
[13:56:24] <BillCriswell> Trying_: Did you setup a demo?
[13:56:45] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Yes and that works flawlessly, doesn't have my problem yet contains the same code
[13:57:35] <Trying_> NoiseEee: that looks like a nice guide, thanks
[13:58:07] <BillCriswell> That ajpiano knows a thing or two about jQuery.
[13:58:43] <blindMoe> nah he is just really good at pretending
[13:58:49] <blindMoe> _really_ good
[14:00:49] <Trying_> BillCriswell: This is the demo, exactly same code in it: http://jsfiddle.net/hcJNy/
[14:01:38] <BillCriswell> Trying_: This code is working.
[14:01:40] <Trying_> BillCriswell: On my local it goes like this: Start -> Fill in value in textbox, press enter -> Change event fired, shown in console -> Refreshes page -> Start is displayed again
[14:01:53] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Exactly, it's working on jsfiddle!
[14:02:42] <BillCriswell> Pressing enter submits the form.
[14:03:01] <BillCriswell> Enter won't trigger the change event.
[14:03:15] <scotdb> And advise on a themeroller theme for dataTables use with smaller fonts (so I can get more table rows into the same real estate)
[14:04:20] <Trying_> BillCriswell: How to prevent this from happening and why does it work in JSfiddle?
[14:05:08] <BillCriswell> Trying_: This isn't wrapped in a form, so there's no form to submit to.
[14:05:25] <Trying_> BillCriswell: That's right
[14:05:49] <BillCriswell> If you want to keep the form from submitting when you pretty enter in that text area you'll have to capture the event
[14:06:19] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Is that the submit event on the textbox?
[14:06:33] <BillCriswell> Trying_: Nope. I believe it goes straight to the form.
[14:06:53] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Which I don't have, so I should create a form and catch the submit event there?
[14:08:18] <BillCriswell> Trying_: http://jsfiddle.net/hcJNy/1/ may help
[14:09:49] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Looks promising, let me implement it in my local solution
[14:09:59] <BillCriswell> That sounds very high-tech.
[14:12:50] <santiissopasse> I'm getting uncaught syntaxerror: unexpected string on line 10, could someone take a look and tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:13:15] <Trying_> BillCriswell: I feel like I'm an experimenting biologist, puttinig different substances into a mix and seeing random unexpected results
[14:13:51] <BillCriswell> Trying_: My favorite time.
[14:13:58] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Your solution... fixed my problem
[14:14:03] <BillCriswell> It's the only time I really get to the end of something is when something is being a pain in the ass.
[14:14:51] <KelVarnsen> how do i deal with literal [1] in an element id when doing a selector
[14:15:10] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: \[1\] should do the trick.
[14:15:32] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: Maybe even $('el[foo="bar[]"]')
[14:16:07] <KelVarnsen> woo thanks
[14:16:44] <BillCriswell> woo welcome!
[14:17:40] <KelVarnsen> does this look decent
[14:17:48] <KelVarnsen>     var hidden = $('#' + item.replace("[", "\[[").replace("]", "\]]"));
[14:18:01] <KelVarnsen> oops
[14:18:03] <KelVarnsen> ]]
[14:18:20] <KelVarnsen> wait no it looks good
[14:19:29] <davezZz> my .fadeOut() seems to be calling twice?
[14:19:31] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: Ok.
[14:19:48] <KelVarnsen> cool high 5
[14:19:51] <davezZz> one moment, ill get hte fiddle.. which works
[14:19:58] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: Great success!
[14:20:09] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Can you try to explain something to me?
[14:20:10] <davezZz> and.. it still hasnt sent me my password reset
[14:20:12] <KelVarnsen> dang it didnt work
[14:20:23] <BillCriswell> davezZz: So you're going to leave the code that's breaking shit out?
[14:20:33] <Trying_> BillCriswell: I tried a different way of catching the submit event before, see here: http://jsfiddle.net/hcJNy/4/
[14:20:36] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: What is item?
[14:20:40] <davezZz> no no, it works in jsfiddle
[14:20:43] <KelVarnsen> ctl00_AppraisalContent_Segregated_Cost_Worksheet_v2SegregatedAreas[1]_FloorArea_FoundationAverage_Foundation_CustomFieldsJSON
[14:20:47] <davezZz> i can see it calling it twice
[14:20:55] <davezZz> when it's in my code, for the first click
[14:20:55] <BillCriswell> Geeze Louise
[14:20:57] <KelVarnsen> its long winded due to ASP.net
[14:20:59] <Trying_> BillCriswell: I actually had this commented out in my code, it works on JSfiddle, doesn't work on my local, how is this possible?
[14:21:15] <BillCriswell> Trying_: Hard working in the dark.
[14:21:24] <KelVarnsen> so its really long
[14:21:31] <KelVarnsen> and i thought the [1] is a problem
[14:22:19] <newbie21> BillCriswell: I'm writing my own SyntaxHightliter brush, it's working! :D
[14:22:19] <Trying_> BillCriswell: Definitely, the selector $("#testForm") doesn't work, $('form') works
[14:24:07] <BillCriswell> Trying_: If #testForm doesn't work something else is wrong.
[14:24:53] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: Two ways around this.
[14:25:03] <KelVarnsen> hit me
[14:25:14] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: http://jsbin.com/ivekes/1/edit
[14:25:20] <BillCriswell> The commented out one works as well.
[14:25:39] <Trying_> BillCriswell: I'll just use form instead, thanks for your support, really appreciate it
[14:25:45] <BillCriswell> Trying_: No problem!
[14:26:46] <KelVarnsen> isnt that what im doing
[14:26:58] <BillCriswell> You did \\[ and \\]
[14:27:13] <BillCriswell> Blah, I mean \[[ and \]]
[14:28:06] <BillCriswell> Those IDS should be illegal.
[14:28:14] <KelVarnsen> oh
[14:28:23] <BillCriswell> I'm not one for legislation, but Obama has to do something.
[14:28:45] <KelVarnsen> oh snap
[14:28:48] <ech0s7> hi all
[14:28:48] <KelVarnsen> i meant \\[
[14:29:08] <ech0s7> in this function: $(xml).find("item").each(function() { //how to get item count ? }
[14:29:11] <KelVarnsen> cause \[ was invalid string
[14:29:30] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: Shit happens.
[14:29:52] <KelVarnsen> tell me about it!
[14:29:52] <BillCriswell> ech0s7: function( index, element ) {} I believe.
[14:30:30] <NoiseEee> ech0s7: $(xml).find("item").length
[14:30:43] <NoiseEee> unless you want to specifically iterate via .each
[14:31:14] <BillCriswell> Oh wait just one argument, function( index ){ }
[14:31:29] <BillCriswell> No... I was right the first time.
[14:31:30] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[14:31:47] <KelVarnsen> it works
[14:32:02] <KelVarnsen> BillCriswell for president
[14:32:12] <Trying_> KelVarnsen: totally agree
[14:32:23] <KelVarnsen> got my vote
[14:32:44] <BillCriswell> i'm a terrible leader.
[14:32:58] <BillCriswell> Boss tried it once. No good.
[14:33:08] <KelVarnsen> ╯°□°）╯︵ǝpouǝǝɹɟ
[14:33:14] <KelVarnsen> was that guys quit msg
[14:33:14] <iredmedia> President
[14:33:53] <KelVarnsen> well thanks a lot BillCriswell back to my craz long ids
[14:34:34] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: Enjoy!
[14:40:47] <KelVarnsen> does anyone happen to know the reverse of JSON.stringify
[14:43:32] <BillCriswell> KelVarnsen: you can do $.parseJSON( jsonString );
[14:44:07] <BillCriswell> JSON.parse( jsonString );
[14:44:16] <BillCriswell> Which I'm sure $.parseJSON uses if it's available.
[14:44:18] <BillCriswell> I'm OUT!
[14:44:26] <KelVarnsen> nice
[14:44:30] <KelVarnsen> thanks again
[15:23:16] <goddard> whats the best way to detect if a check box has been selected because I successfully detect the click event, but for some reason the checkbox is always detected to be checked true and false at the same time.  I am trying to show or hide a button based on if it is selected
[15:23:22] <goddard> similar to accepting terms and condidtions
[15:25:45] <EvilNo0B> Is anyone available atm ?
[15:28:15] <EvilNo0B> Now , i have my header changing all the time on refresh , is there any way to make it change image smoothly and not just Poof different image?
[15:33:59] <goddard> how do you change system sounds?
[15:36:50] <pixelpimp> Like fade from one image to another after so long?  Position the two images on top of each other, .fadeOut() the top one to reveal the one beneath.  Make the bottom image now the top image (there's a couple ways to do that), set the bottom image to the next and set it back up to full opacity, then rinse and repeat
[15:37:02] <pixelpimp> goddard: system sounds?
[15:38:42] <EvilNo0B> pixelpimp yeah sort of but im a total newbie in js , maybe u could help me ?
[15:38:42] <EvilNo0B> <script type="text/javascript">
[15:38:42] <EvilNo0B> function Randomize() {
[15:38:42] <EvilNo0B> 	var images = new Array("images/header/1.jpg","images/header/2.jpg","images/header/3.jpg","images/header/4.jpg","images/header/5.jpg");
[15:38:42] <EvilNo0B> 	var imageNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length);
[15:38:43] <EvilNo0B> 	document.getElementById("header").style.backgroundImage = "url('" + images[imageNum] + "')";
[15:38:43] <EvilNo0B> }
[15:38:44] <EvilNo0B> window.onload = animate(Randomize);
[15:38:44] <EvilNo0B> </script>
[15:38:51] <andrewSC> YEAH YEAHYEAHYEAH
[15:39:02] <andrewSC> that was awesome
[15:39:17] <tw2113> andrewSC, i topped that once
[15:39:18] <pixelpimp> lesson 1: don't paste to irc
[15:39:28] <andrewSC> tw2113: personal hero
[15:39:30] <tw2113> accidentally pasted jquery in base64
[15:39:39] <andrewSC> that had to be amazing
[15:39:50] <pixelpimp> you're in #jquery but not using jquery?
[15:39:54] <andrewSC> I would have screencapped for suree
[15:40:00] <scotdb> What does a selector of the form like this do please :  $(".something", oValue) : in other words it looks like two selectors separated by a comma
[15:40:19] <scotdb> Is it an AND or an OR ?
[15:44:56] <pixelpimp> scotdb: it's the context to check in, not two selectors.  assuming i understand you correctly
[15:45:56] <pixelpimp> i.e. it's not searching for ".something" as well as oValue; it's searching for ".something" within oValue.
[16:05:40] <goddard> whats the best way to detect if a check box has been selected because I successfully detect the click event, but for some reason the checkbox is always detected to be checked true and false at the same time.  I am trying to show or hide a button based on if it is selected
[16:05:44] <goddard> similar to accepting terms and condidtions
[16:06:02] <goddard> ive tried prop('checked', true)
[16:06:20] <goddard> and that works but when i do else it never hides my button
[16:06:28] <goddard> the hide function is used correctly
[16:07:38] <pixelpimp> pastebin your code?
[16:52:54] <alex_javascript> Hey everyone
[16:57:20] <savid> Can someone point me to a plugin boilerplate that works like this:   $("#myelement").pluginame();  $("#myelement").pluginname("somemethod", {option1: val})
[16:57:41] <eddiemonge> savid: you mean like the official example?
[16:57:56] <savid> eddiemonge, heh, I guess if that's the official one I'm having trouble finding it :-/
[16:58:21] <eddiemonge> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/
[16:59:54] <shoky> savid: this is my favorite http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Data
[17:00:22] <savid> shoky, ah yes, that's the one I was originally looking for. wonder why they removed it?
[17:00:47] <shoky> savid: i guess they were planning to do something better.. but imo that's not happened yet
[17:54:44] <pouledodue> hello is there something in jquery to count occurences of all word in a textarea
[17:56:27] <dismist> var temp = "This is a string."; var count = temp.match(/is/g);  alert(count.length);
[17:56:38] <dismist> var temp = "This is is is is a string."; var count = temp.match(/is/g);  alert(count.length);
[17:59:35] <systemfault> Why would jQuery have that...
[17:59:35] <systemfault> Just write it yourself… it's like a 2-3 lines function
[17:59:35] <systemfault> You can do it monsieur.
[18:00:32] <alex_javascript> textField.value.match(/wordToSearchFor/g).length-1
[18:00:39] <alex_javascript> or something
[18:02:37] <pouledodue> of all words
[18:03:31] <alex_javascript> Use a regex
[18:03:37] <sammichToo> okay, so apparently it's a bad idea to extend Object.prototype
[18:03:59] <alex_javascript> sammichToo - What gives you that idea?
[18:04:00] <sammichToo> so is there a nice way to use something like .map but for objects?
[18:04:00] <alex_javascript> :P
[18:04:09] <sammichToo> it breaks jQuery, apparently
[18:04:14] <sammichToo> oh
[18:04:17] <sammichToo> yeah, :p
[18:04:36] <alex_javascript> for (var propName in objToSearch) ?
[18:04:42] <alex_javascript> You want a functional way of doing it?
[18:04:46] <sammichToo> yes
[18:05:03] <sammichToo> just want a nicer way
[18:05:12] <alex_javascript> Is using lodash/underscore out of the question?
[18:05:27] <sammichToo> preferably no more libraries :)
[18:05:37] <sammichToo> can I just roll my own?
[18:06:09] <alex_javascript> sure - just wrap for example I gave in a function
[18:06:16] <sammichToo> sammichesLibrary.map(obj, callback)?
[18:06:38] <alex_javascript> Why do you need a callback exactly - doing async stuff?
[18:06:57] <sammichToo> well, I need a function to operate on the values in the object
[18:07:00] <alex_javascript> ah
[18:07:10] <sammichToo> it's not a call back
[18:07:11] <alex_javascript> I call that an iterator - not sure if it's a standard term
[18:07:15] <sammichToo> bad choice of words
[18:07:57] <sammichToo> oh well, type a few more chars
[18:08:14] <sammichToo> at least I get an automatic closure
[18:08:31] <sammichToo> without the whole machinery of declaring vars everywhere
[18:09:03] <alex_javascript> yep so: function(obj, iterator) {var newObj; for (var propName in obj) {if (obj.hasOwnProperty(propName) { newObj[propName] = iterator(obj[propName]) }} }
[18:09:07] <alex_javascript> That sort of thing?
[18:09:24] <alex_javascript> oh and return newOb
[18:09:27] <sammichToo> something like that
[18:09:58] <alex_javascript> I think lodash works on objects - maybe peek at their code
[18:10:04] <sammichToo> except it'll be callBack.call(null, obj[key])
[18:10:21] <alex_javascript> Why does it need to be that?
[18:10:36] <alex_javascript> Why can't you call it directly?
[18:11:20] <alex_javascript> why not callBack(obj[key])?
[18:12:07] <Dinho> anyone know how to duplicate the variables php also http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/tBVeZ/3/  ??
[18:15:54] <alex_javascript> I looked at the example
[18:16:08] <alex_javascript> I have no idea what you're on about
[18:19:29] <sammichToo> alex_javascript: hah, oops, yeah that
[18:21:30] <Dinho> y try clone Envolvidos:
[18:21:30] <Dinho>     NOME: CPF:
[18:25:05] <Dinho> I am trying to create dynamic fields with jquery. clone, these fields are saved in the database. I'm trying to do is clone the inputs with the values ​​of variais php example to create a new field NAME and CPF, the next field would set the value <? php echo $ e_nome1;?> after <? php echo $ e_nome2 ;?> ....
[18:25:14] <Dinho> http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/tBVeZ/3/
[18:26:05] <alex_javascript> What1? That sounds crazy. How many fields are there in the db?
[18:26:24] <Dinho> I'm Brazilian and do not speak well English, sorry
[18:26:38] <Dinho> 10 fields
[18:26:58] <Dinho> name1 cpf 1 name2 cp2 name3 cpf3
[18:27:06] <bambanx_> guys looks this cool effect http://themeforest.net/item/skygo-one-page-html-template/full_screen_preview/4592803
[18:27:11] <bambanx_> is jquery or some?
[18:28:04] <Dinho> I will post my php file in pastebin
[18:28:18] <paulvd> whats wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/KQbnz/1/
[18:28:50] <alex_javascript> You've put .home-titles
[18:28:52] <alex_javascript> not home-title
[18:29:17] <alex_javascript> wait - it's different
[18:29:33] <BillCriswell> paulvd: $(this).('img') shoudl be $(this).find('img')
[18:30:53] <alex_javascript> paulvd - If you hit F12 - it brings up debugging tools
[18:30:59] <alex_javascript> super useful for finding those sorts of errors
[18:31:16] <paulvd> firebug or firefox debug ?
[18:31:35] <paulvd> i have used firebug for css
[18:31:36] <alex_javascript> It will bring up firebug I think on Firefox?
[18:31:43] <alex_javascript> If you have it installed
[18:31:46] <paulvd> but never figured out how to debug it for jquery
[18:31:55] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Look for the "Console" tab.
[18:32:06] <alex_javascript> Thanks BillCriswell
[18:32:31] <BillCriswell> alex_javascript: You're welcome I think haha.
[18:34:25] * alex_javascript moved away from Firebug when Chrome devtools turned useful
[18:36:10] <BillCriswell> Dinho: I'm having a hard time following you I think. When you click the + button you want the value to be <?php echo $e_nome2; ?> then <?php echo $e_nome3; ?> if it's clicked again?
[18:36:34] <Dinho> yesssssss
[18:36:53] <Dinho> this is what I need to do
[18:38:05] <BillCriswell> Dinho: You can't actually run the PHP though. Unless you literally want "<?php echo $e_nome2; ?>" as the value of the input?
[18:38:34] <Dinho> need that when you click it duplicates + e_nome2 e_cpf2 next e_nome3 e_cpf3
[18:38:36] <Dinho> yes
[18:39:07] <Dinho> will be the value of the input I'm going to save the database
[18:40:00] <davezZz> how, if i have say... $('.myclass')  then whant to use $(this) .. can i do $(this '> img') ?
[18:41:23] <BillCriswell> davezZz: $('.myclass').find('> img')
[18:42:46] <BillCriswell> Dinho: Do you mean to have them wrapped in PHP tags?
[18:44:44] <davezZz> so i could do $(This).find('>img');
[18:44:57] <BillCriswell> Without the capital T
[18:45:02] <davezZz> also, is there any reason.. that this.. $('.imageholder').html('<img src=\"'+imagearray[i].img1+'\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\"> <img>'); would add extra <img></img> tags?
[18:45:42] <BillCriswell> davezZz: You have an extra <img> tag at the end.
[18:45:52] <davezZz> oh.. my..
[18:46:02] <davezZz> 2 days, you realise.. 2 days trying to figure why my code wasnt working
[18:46:07] <BillCriswell> Also, you don't need to escape double-quotes in your strings.
[18:46:09] <davezZz> </img> it should be
[18:46:19] <BillCriswell> davezZz: You don't need that.
[18:46:21] <davezZz> it's habit BillCriswell
[18:46:27] <pixelpimp> <img />
[18:46:35] <pixelpimp> has no end tag
[18:46:47] <davezZz> i put them in anyway, i recall ie8 crying with some tags not being explicitly closed
[18:46:53] <davezZz> so i just do it anyway now
[18:46:57] <tw2113> doesn't </img> invalidate current validators?
[18:47:05] <pixelpimp> just incorrect
[18:47:06] <BillCriswell> davezZz: $('.imageholder').html('<img src="' + imagearray[i].img1 + '" width="400" height="250">'); is probably your best bet.
[18:47:07] <davezZz> no
[18:47:20] <davezZz> <img src="blah"> somewords</img>
[18:47:36] <davezZz> i dunno, anyways, yeah that was the issue
[18:47:39] <davezZz> i cant believe how blind i was to it
[18:47:50] <BillCriswell> Okie doke!
[18:47:53] <davezZz> cheers
[18:48:00] <davezZz> my beautiful beauuutiful image gallery XD
[18:48:20] <davezZz> now to make a little film strippy thing at the bottom.. :S
[18:48:38] <BillCriswell> Have fun!
[18:50:24] <chrisTech> I'm getting "$ is not defined" error. My files are called in this order: 1) jquery.js, 2) jquery-placeholder.js, 3) firing script (eg. $(this).placeHolder();). I have all files locally. Anybody know how to fix this problem?
[18:50:55] <BillCriswell> chrisTech: Make sure jquery.js has content inside of it.
[18:50:57] <tw2113> probably a noConflict case
[18:51:13] <chrisTech> I checked them all, they have the right content.
[18:51:32] <tw2113> does it work when you use jQuery instead of $ ?
[18:51:37] <alex_javascript> ^
[18:51:42] <chrisTech> It will say "jquery is not defined"
[18:51:50] <alex_javascript> with a capital Q?
[18:51:53] <alex_javascript> jQuery
[18:52:01] <chrisTech> Let me check what I did...
[18:52:27] <chrisTech> Yes, "jQuery", not working
[18:52:45] <BillCriswell> Dinho: Do you want to do like this with your code? http://jsbin.com/apixuz/1/edit
[18:52:49] <alex_javascript> ok so was there a syntax error somewhere BEFORE you managed to load jQuery
[18:52:59] <alex_javascript> Anything loading before?
[18:53:35] <alex_javascript> Your next step is to just load jQuery if possible - does $/jQuery work then?
[18:53:57] <chrisTech> Nope, 1, 2, and 3 are my only scripts loaded.
[18:54:18] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, let me try that...
[18:54:22] <BillCriswell> chrisTech: Are you running from file:/// ?
[18:55:21] <alex_javascript> chrisTech: How did you verify the contents of the file? In the network tab of the debugger?
[18:56:32] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, I checked source code and clicked on the links in my head tag, when they open they show me the scripts.
[18:57:15] <BillCriswell> chrisTech: Are they coming through in the network tab?
[18:57:16] <alex_javascript> ok don't do that
[18:57:22] <alex_javascript> Are you using chrome?
[18:57:30] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, I loaded just the jquery.js and did $(document).ready(function() { something here }); , same error.
[18:57:46] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, Yes, Chrome
[18:57:56] <BillCriswell> Do you see it in the Network tab?
[18:57:58] <alex_javascript> OK hit F12 to open the debugger; open the Network tab
[18:58:09] <alex_javascript> Then click on the file you're trying to load
[18:58:18] <alex_javascript> And go the "response" tab on the right
[18:58:25] <alex_javascript> (if it has a response)
[18:58:47] <chrisTech> BillCriswell / alex_javascript, not in network.
[18:58:58] <BillCriswell> chrisTech: If you added the "type" attribute to the script tags make sure "text/javascript" is typed correctly.
[18:59:29] <chrisTech> BillCriswell, yes they are typed correctly.
[18:59:32] <BillCriswell> I typed type="text/javascrpt" one time and it took me like 30 minutes to figure it out.
[18:59:35] <alex_javascript> i.e script tags look like this <script type="text/javascript" src="chrisTechs/script.js"><script?
[18:59:52] <alex_javascript> with a closing square bracket
[18:59:57] <alex_javascript> instead of q. mark.
[19:00:01] <BillCriswell> chrisTech: Restart your browser. IF that doesn't work there's something you're not telling us lol
[19:00:15] <BillCriswell> chrisTech: Is the HTML valid?
[19:00:20] <alex_javascript> chrisTech - What do you mean it's not in network?
[19:00:30] <chrisTech> BillCriswell, what do you mean?
[19:00:39] <alex_javascript> It's not even showing up?
[19:00:46] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, I mean I don't see it in the list.
[19:01:02] <alex_javascript> Well that means it's not even trying to get it - any other error messages? Most likely in red
[19:01:15] <alex_javascript> BillCriswell's theory of invalid html is starting to look most likely
[19:01:26] <BillCriswell> It's something weird.
[19:01:33] <BillCriswell> Ok I'm out. Have a good one!
[19:01:36] <alex_javascript> nn
[19:02:25] <alex_javascript> right chris what have you done
[19:02:43] <alex_javascript> copy the html > jsiddle
[19:02:46] <alex_javascript> jsfiddle*
[19:02:56] <alex_javascript> All will be revealed
[19:03:21] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, this is another problem, I tried it in fiddle (in an attempt to show you guys here in IRC) but when I run it, it works there.
[19:03:48] <alex_javascript> So there's are NO red requests in the network tab?
[19:03:50] <chrisTech> alex_javascript,  http://jsfiddle.net/ySdbA/1
[19:03:55] <alex_javascript> Send me the link to jsFiddle/
[19:03:58] <alex_javascript> ok thanks
[19:04:25] <alex_javascript> Well of course it works in jsFiddle - the link to the script isn't in there
[19:04:36] <alex_javascript> pastebin me the WHOLE HTML PAGE (is possible)
[19:04:40] <alex_javascript> if*
[19:04:47] <chrisTech> ok
[19:07:07] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, http://pastebin.com/cURfjcE1
[19:08:50] <alex_javascript> the second script tag
[19:08:56] <alex_javascript> doesn't have a type
[19:09:14] <alex_javascript> also
[19:09:17] <alex_javascript> first script tag
[19:09:21] <alex_javascript> wants to be src=""
[19:09:26] <alex_javascript> NOT href=""
[19:09:52] <quentusrex> How can jquery access(and change) an array of key/value params? I'm trying to use datatables to handle a table, and the aoData structure is an array of key value pairs.
[19:10:00] <alex_javascript>     <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script> >> NOT >>  <script type="text/javascript" href="js/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>
[19:10:21] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, let me try that
[19:10:37] <alex_javascript> It is 99% likely to be the problem
[19:10:49] <alex_javascript> quentusrex - Can you expend
[19:10:56] <alex_javascript> expand also - Cannot type today
[19:11:34] <alex_javascript> quentusrex What is your intention, maybe a to, from example?
[19:11:56] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, ok, it's working in my local, trying in my online dev site now...
[19:12:18] <quentusrex> alex_javascript, I am trying to compute the api to call for data tables to have the server sort the columns.
[19:12:35] <quentusrex> The problem is that the column name needs to be mapped for the server to sort it properly.
[19:13:11] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, you just saved me hours of work, thank you!!!!!!
[19:13:32] <alex_javascript> Your IDE could have saved you hours of work also
[19:13:39] <alex_javascript> What platform are you on?
[19:14:30] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, what do you mean, like what browser I'm using?
[19:14:33] <quentusrex> alex_javascript, I'm trying to replace one of the key/value pairs in the array
[19:14:37] <alex_javascript> No - what editor
[19:14:58] <alex_javascript> So it's an array of objects?
[19:15:07] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, local = notepad++; online = vim (bash)
[19:15:23] <alex_javascript> chrisTech - go checkout webstorm
[19:15:33] <alex_javascript> It would have picked that up
[19:15:59] <chrisTech> alex_javascript, checking it out now...
[19:17:26] <quentusrex> alex_javascript, yes, it's an array of object
[19:17:33] <alex_javascript> chrisTech: e.g. http://imgur.com/spjNfke
[19:17:43] <quentusrex> objects*. Specifically an array of key/value pairs
[19:17:45] <alex_javascript> quentusrex: You want .map then?
[19:18:16] <alex_javascript> quentusrex: resultArray.map(function(item, index) { item.property = newValue });
[19:18:28] <RonWhoCares> Is it possible to include relatedSelects on jsfiddle so I can ask for help?
[19:18:33] <quentusrex> alex_javascript, except that it appears DataTables passes the variable by reference, so I need a way to overwrite the passed in array
[19:18:53] <alex_javascript> RonWhoCares there is a button to add external resources top left
[19:18:56] <bjorn_> hey quick question
[19:18:59] <bjorn_> http://backofhouse.morganshotelgroup.com/
[19:19:11] <bjorn_> on that site can someone car to guess why it loads all slides right away
[19:20:01] <alex_javascript> RonWhoCares: http://imgur.com/iAr2vZg
[19:20:05] <alex_javascript> See on the left there
[19:20:53] <alex_javascript> bjorn_ My guess is that's how it's been programmed
[19:21:25] <bjorn_> alex_javascript:  i see ; i just have been playing around with the tiny carousel
[19:21:32] <bjorn_> and it doesnt seem to affect anything
[19:22:08] <alex_javascript> You want to lazy load the images? (on demand)@
[19:22:14] <alex_javascript> ?
[19:25:52] <RonWhoCares> I have created my jsfiddle @ http://jsfiddle.net/zjjPd/2/   My problem: The <option> s contained in http://christian-activity-central.org/functions/test.html are not populating the keyword <select>  ( "k5[] ]
[19:26:36] <bjorn_> correct
[19:26:47] <bjorn_> alex_javascript: for some reason they arent lazy loading
[19:29:05] <alex_javascript> Did you write this site?
[19:31:34] <alex_javascript> bjorn_: Can you find the point where you're *trying* to lazy load them
[19:37:56] <RonWhoCares> alex_javascript: Yes
[19:38:08] <RonWhoCares> (although i am unsure if you are asking me)
[20:11:57] <RonWhoCares> how do i correct append the results to a <div> ?  function(data) { $("#multiselect_simple").html(append); });
[20:21:28] <[E]sc> i'm having trouble trying to get my setTimeout working.  The problem is that every time I fire the function, the new page request time does not reset/update to the newest time and instead keeps counting until the predefined timeout. maybe it's something wrong with my code? here is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/30cJVEkD
[20:36:02] <Quest> is it true that javascript has became more vast than java or csharp (modern languages thought to be very huge)?  2. why not use leave javascript and convert to jQuery? is jQuery a FULL replacement of JS?
[20:44:17] <systemfault> No/Because jQuery _is_ JavaScript/No, only a DOM abstraction library.
[20:46:12] <Quest> 1. i know. i meant the syntax only. 2.what do you mean dom extraction?
[20:46:22] <systemfault> abstraction..
[20:47:02] <systemfault> It's like a layer on top of what the browser provides that makes it easier to use.
[20:47:07] <Quest> systemfault,  how much experience do you have in jquery and how much wil you rate yourself out of 10 ?
[20:47:21] <systemfault> 5 years, 8
[20:47:34] <Quest> 5 years in jquery  / js ?
[20:47:40] <systemfault> Yep.
[20:47:53] <Quest> you dont  know / wanted to shift to some other thing?
[20:47:58] <Quest> serverside etc? css ?
[20:48:59] <systemfault> I already do server-side and CSS..
[20:49:04] <Quest> systemfault,  can you do a contract based work?
[20:49:09] <systemfault> Server-side using node.js or PHP or Java.
[20:49:19] <systemfault> Sorry, I'm fully busy right now.
[20:49:46] <Quest> hm.. want to refer a similar skilled person like you?
[20:56:02] <Quest> is jquery opensource and free to read/ modify? understand?
[21:08:28] <matchs> Quest, sorry to intrude in your conversation. But aswering your last question: Yes, jQuery is OpenSource under MIT License. https://jquery.org/license/
[21:12:24] <Quest> matchs,  briefly, whats mit?
[21:16:27] <matchs> See here Quest, it's really short: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
[21:25:16] <Quest> matchs,  thx
[21:31:37] <Foxhoundz> jQ
[21:48:36] <RonWhoCares> I just made this jsfiddle.  http://jsfiddle.net/yYcK2/  I can't figure out why the various <input type="checkbox" > results are displaying   Is someone able to help guide me
[21:54:03] <matchs> RonWhoCares, maybe I can help you, but I couldn't understand your question.
[21:54:17] <RonWhoCares> ok
[21:54:37] <RonWhoCares> matchs open this URL: http://www.christian-activity-central.org/functions/portal_link_keywords_retrieve.php?category_reference=4
[21:54:43] <matchs> done
[21:54:47] <matchs> ok
[21:55:29] <matchs> So, what are you trying to do?
[21:55:57] <RonWhoCares> matchs: I want the set of check boxes associated with the <select> Choose Area Of Portal For Your Link To Be Displayed to populate the <div> #keywords_container
[21:57:01] <RonWhoCares> When I open the Firefox console I can see   category_reference	4   is being passed
[21:57:49] <RonWhoCares> matchs: I don't understand there is no output, like you saw in the URL I just posted
[21:58:32] <RonWhoCares> A PHP script is triggered to display the checkboxes
[22:00:12] <RonWhoCares> matchs: I can paste the PHP code, if it would be helpful.  But by showing you this link:     http://www.christian-activity-central.org/functions/portal_link_keywords_retrieve.php?category_reference=4   You can see there should be output if category_reference is passed
[22:01:13] <matchs> Ok, first RonWhoCares, tell me if I undertood you correctly: You want to check one of those checkbox-items and show them as a keyword in the #keywords_container?
[22:02:14] <RonWhoCares> matchs: I only want the related set of checkboxes to display, based on the <select> list.  Where I want it to display is #keywords_container
[22:02:39] <matchs> ok, got it
[22:02:48] <RonWhoCares> - I am going to process the selected checkboxes when the form is submitted.
[22:03:16] <matchs> Great! got you now!
[22:03:43] <RonWhoCares> excellent.  Do you something wrong?  I can't figure it out.
[22:06:14] <matchs> ok... first thing... your selection $('#website_introduction_page') doesn't exists. At least, I couldn't find it.
[22:07:02] <RonWhoCares> matchs It does on my screen --- I took it out by accident.
[22:07:19] <RonWhoCares> - I removed the "introduction" text  when I created the jsfiddle
[22:07:27] <igna293> anyone familiar with the jquery ui autocomplete?
[22:08:09] <matchs> RonWhoCares, ok, no problem, could you please send me the correct one?
[22:08:40] <matchs> igna293, I've worked with it sometimes... need any help?
[22:09:22] <igna293> matchs:  i was just wondering if its possible to do some sort of zebra styling in the autocomplete results
[22:09:34] <RonWhoCares> matchs: The URL is http://christian-activity-central.org/add-my-link/
[22:10:32] <RonWhoCares> matchs: You can see the whole thing there.  The jquery is in the file   portal_link_add.js
[22:10:46] <matchs> igna293, Yes, it is. You can use the :odd and :even css selectors.
[22:12:52] <matchs> RonWhoCares, Let me see if I can see something wrong really quick. Meanwhile, could you please explain what you expected it to do and what it is doing wrong?
[22:14:11] <RonWhoCares> matchs: - What it is doing wrong is there are no checkboxes output as I showed you in the address
[22:14:47] <matchs> ok
[22:15:31] <RonWhoCares> matchs: I am setting up a different set of keywords for each section.  I want the related set of available keyword options to populte <div id="keywords_container"></div>
[22:18:11] <matchs> RonWhoCares, That's the error that is being reported when you try to make that request: 2
[22:18:11] <matchs> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.christian-activity-central.org/functions/portal_link_keywords_retrieve.php. Origin http://christian-activity-central.org is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[22:18:41] <matchs> That's a CORS problem
[22:19:21] <RonWhoCares> what is CORS ?
[22:19:26] <matchs> Cross-origin resource sharing
[22:19:49] <matchs> That happens when you try an AJAX request from diferent domains
[22:20:00] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:20:02] <matchs> jQuery, by default, doesn't allow that
[22:20:15] <RonWhoCares> so if I remove " www. " it should work?
[22:20:25] <matchs> probably... give it a try
[22:20:30] <RonWhoCares> ok
[22:20:35] <matchs> I'm not sure, but give it a try
[22:20:37] <RonWhoCares> I just removed it.  I am going to do a hard refresh
[22:21:00] <RonWhoCares> It fixed it
[22:21:07] <RonWhoCares> Thank you so very very very much
[22:21:36] <matchs> RonWhoCares, You're welcome... If you need anything, just talk to me
[23:00:04] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone assist here please: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838078/how-to-send-my-form-data-to-my-post-script-uploadify
[23:03:11] <fRAiLtY-> Where's Cork  recently he usually solves everything :D
[23:06:37] <yankov> what is the good plugin to do infinite pagination scroll?
[23:17:00] <[E]sc> fRAiLtY-, why don't you create the timestamp and token in the index.php since they're not being used in the jquery script?
[23:17:04] <lemonsparrow> how I can get the code for  w/ CSS3 Animations implementation here ?  http://www.htmldrive.net/items/demo/1273/jQuery-Collapse-A-lightweight-jQuery-plugin-that-enables-expanding-and-collapsing-content
[23:17:43] <fRAiLtY-> [E]sc: But I'm still faced with the first problem of passing it to my oncomplete.php file
[23:19:05] <[E]sc> fRAiLtY-, i haven't used uploadify, but have you tried appending the information? formData.append("time", timestamp);?
[23:20:03] <fRAiLtY-> [E]sc I don't think that would help at this point, purely because I don't seem to be able to pass anything in formData to oncomplete.php
[23:23:13] <fRAiLtY-> [E]sc I'm reasonably confident it's because in Uploadify onQueueComplete only accepts specific arguments, none of which are form data, in fact, nothing Uploadify accepts is form data, hence why I'm having to go round it, but nothing I do seems to post the data
[23:32:04] <shahin8r> Anyone know how to change this $('a[href^="#"]') to just select the ones that have a character after # like <a href="#t"> should be selected but not <a href="#">
[23:33:59] <[E]sc> fRAiLtY-, just a wild shot in the dark...<?php echo md5('salt' . $timestamp);?> should salt be in double quotes? seeing that you encompassed the rest in single quotes?
[23:37:23] <kiss_p>  Hi guys i wanna to use a counter
