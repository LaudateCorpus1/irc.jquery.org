[03:25:29] <Space-Duck> Can someone explain why unminified code always looks like e=function(), k=function(), etc... It's not actually written that way, right? It's almost like there is some sort of jQuery compiler I don't know about... It's driving me mad!
[03:26:13] <karstenk> Please can somebody help me with that calculation of the focal point for a panning and zooming plane? https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/xsF7PfmWNJHW8r2UXFaC8w  The first part is working and center the element to the middle, but when zooming it flys out of the viewport. Here this site you can test in fullscreen and with doubleclick/tap http://pbc.tomws.ddnss.de/tournament/4?debug=assets
[03:26:33] <karstenk> pane not plane :-)
[03:28:00] <karstenk> The first double click goes to the totale view and the second should focus the node you have clicked and zoom in and center it.
[07:05:38] <fas3r> Hello
[07:05:53] <fas3r> I have the following :
[07:06:12] <Woet> that's not a lot
[07:06:22] <fas3r> haha :D
[07:06:46] <fas3r> var item = myVarToTest.match(/\[idx\]/g);   how can I replace \[idx\] by a variable ?
[07:07:38] <fas3r> I need to change idx to different value, but I need to keep the backslack bracket ( \[ ... \] ) around
[07:07:42] <Woet> fas3r: what did you google for so far?
[07:08:40] <fas3r> Woet: to pass a
[07:08:47] <fas3r> new RegExp(pattern) inside the match
[07:09:15] <fas3r> however it will not escape the bracket
[07:09:36] <Woet> fas3r: I'm not entirely sure how this is a jQuery question, but can you share your test case?
[07:11:49] <fas3r> this will return true :       var inputName = "myInput[idx]"; var matching = inputName.match(/\[idx\]/g); if(matching) { return true } ;
[07:12:00] <fas3r> this will return undefined/false :       var inputName = "myInput[idy]"; var matching = inputName.match(/\[idx\]/g); if(matching) { return true } ;
[07:14:56] <fas3r> if it's matching, it should return an array with only one element the index with the bracket, in the first example it will return ["[idx]"]
[07:16:00] <fas3r> I can still use .replace to escape manually the bracket before passing it to the match() withing the "new regExp())"
[07:20:23] <fas3r> Woet: yep, that's the way to go. thanks anyway.
[09:19:54] <lte-13[m]> Hi
[09:19:55] <lte-13[m]> https://0bin.net/paste/pq5Bt6yh8qAViKbh#0MONp-alDjwoKL13DmkmjneTLVEm+iOUxYeIBniPs28
[09:20:16] <lte-13[m]> Im trying to pull the data from this array endpoint api... but I dont know what to write?
[09:20:39] <lte-13[m]> Can anyone help me?
[09:25:37] <fas3r> lte-13[m]: remove your var text = ... and start with a console.log(data); and then maybe console.log(data.hash); and you will find your way.
[09:27:50] <Woet> lte-13[m]: wrong quotes.
[09:29:25] <lte-13[m]> Woet: Wrong quotes?
[09:29:39] <lte-13[m]> the data.hash[0] i guess is just bs btw
[09:30:06] <lte-13[m]> fas3r: but i will keep the rest?
[09:31:39] <lte-13[m]> I did it.. looking at chrome console...?
[09:31:52] <Woet> lte-13[m]: nvm
[09:32:06] <lte-13[m]> Basically I just need to know how to access the "hash", since im guessing [] is an array
[09:32:14] <lte-13[m]> Ive googled but cant find anything about it
[09:32:23] <lte-13[m]> I think it is easier than I think (?)
[09:33:00] <Woet> lte-13[m]: https://jsfiddle.net/Leu7z7su/3/
[09:33:17] <Woet> lte-13[m]: check the console and you can see there's no such thing as "hash" on the base level
[09:33:38] <lte-13[m]> Yeah, I know
[09:33:43] <lte-13[m]> But how do I get past the base level
[09:33:51] <lte-13[m]> I mean I have to get into the array right and pick hash
[09:33:57] <Woet> lte-13[m]: [0], [1], etc
[09:34:08] <Woet> https://s.woet.me/5XvSNoh8KD.png
[09:34:11] <Woet> as mentioned by console.log
[09:34:15] <lte-13[m]> Oh so I was correct in doing that. I will see
[09:34:57] <lte-13[m]> But... the array doesnt say it is called anything? Or wait.. I need to pull that getjson stuff, and then name that something? and then use [0] etc
[09:35:36] <lte-13[m]>     var text = `Date: ${data[1]}<br> ?
[09:36:43] <lte-13[m]> What are you using to check the log Woet
[09:37:48] <Woet> lte-13[m]: console of your browser
[09:38:35] <lte-13[m]> https://0bin.net/paste/UgekD9fyPIAy+zvQ#oPWARBgkJZCZOig5WN6SEbm9fefPERG89l6gupijGZ2
[09:38:40] <lte-13[m]> Ok, so this is how it looks like right now.
[09:39:16] <lte-13[m]> Or wait.. hmm im getting something now I think?
[09:41:10] <lte-13[m]> Woet: https://i.imgur.com/ECqbgth.png
[09:41:23] <Woet> lte-13[m]: yup
[09:41:45] <lte-13[m]> So that means it pulls the stuff in the [
[09:41:58] <lte-13[m]> But I need to define that right? But how? Or am I wrong
[09:48:24] <lte-13[m]> Woet: Not really sure what to write really
[09:49:41] <Woet> lte-13[m]: thats okay, take your time.
[09:50:40] <lte-13[m]> Woet: Do I have to scrap the  var text = completely?
[09:50:56] <Woet> lte-13[m]: not for me.
[09:51:35] <lte-13[m]> var text = `Date: ${data[1]}<br> If I do that, it just gives me undefined
[09:53:50] <lte-13[m]> Wow I think I did it
[09:53:52] <lte-13[m]> it was just data.hash or data.size
[09:56:15] <lte-13[m]> Thanks for the quick help. I just started with Jquery so quite a noob and got stuck on this.  Going to try to do an if else loop now so I might come back :P
[12:05:46] <lte-13[m]> No wait, I did it wrong. Used another api endpoint
[12:40:31] <lte-13[m]> var text = `Hash: ${data[1].height} was correct :p
[12:40:57] <lte-13[m]> var text = `Hash: ${data[1].hash}<br> rather
[13:06:42] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:47:24] <jak2000> in other words: i have a number 36 and this set of numbers: i have a set of numbers (5,13,9,12,22,50,18)    how to know wich numbers of the set do the sum? sample in this case: 13+18+5 thanks
[14:03:40] <pavonia> It's a variation of the knapsack problem
[14:17:49] <jak2000> pavonia subset sum problem i think
[14:53:23] <RabSimpson> Hi folks, I'm trying to trigger some CSS animations when their parent elements become visible, but they're currently all animating at once when the first one becomes visible. Here's my page: https://www.stonebanktravel.co.uk/?bypasss_=1 Any ideas?
[15:36:50] <shoky_> RabSimpson: loop over each .slide-image with .each() and check each one separately with $(this) and $(this).find(...) inside the loop. instead of selecting all of them with e.g. jQuery( homeSlideImage+' .right p' )
[15:41:38] <RabSimpson> shoky: Should I loop over them in homeSlideImages()?
[15:43:41] <shoky_> RabSimpson: yea
[15:51:16] <RabSimpson> shoky: I've tried this, but I'm thinking I should be using 'this' but I'm not sure how to apply it in this context
[15:55:14] <RabSimpson> shoky: I've got it working :D
[15:57:22] <shoky_> RabSimpson: nice ;)
[15:58:04] <RabSimpson> .each with jQuery( this ).find did what I needed :D
[15:59:09] <shoky_> yep it's what i suggested if you read my whole answer :p
[16:00:18] <RabSimpson> shoky: Sorry, I've had a few drinks :P
[16:01:00] <RabSimpson> shoky: Thanks for your help :)
[16:09:03] <shoky_> RabSimpson: np ;]
[16:29:30] <rafuch0> Hi somebody can spot something wrong in this jquery validate code... this code in form that is at the bottom of my document works OK, i try to copy paste to use it on other form that is on top and is not working. i change all the values to adapt to the new from but still can you guys check i am  missingg something there. thanks

[18:18:55] <z1haze> what would the 'cache' prop be set to by default when using $.get?
[18:27:04] <Azrael_-> is there a way i could combine a normal input-field as a search-field with a drop-down? (i want to provide a similar experience as the data-filter with excel)
[22:22:54] <fas3r> hello, if I have this :       var myVar = [ { myIdx1 : 'myValue1' }, { myIdx2 : 'myValue2' } ];       how can I determinate the index of "myIdx2" in myVar array ? ( in this case 1 )
