[04:43:18] <momomo> I have a 1 script and 1 stylesheet that i need to load in the head element .. but I also have two text files ... i would like the text files to start loading immedieatly at the same time as the script and link .. but I am getting a delayed ( stalled in chrome ) and they are loaded first after .. even though I am making the xmlhttprequrest before those files are actually declared in the head ... i have tried link href rel=preload prefetch
[04:43:18] <momomo> and so on .. but I can't get the behaviour i want .. only firefox is actually loading them when the xmlhttprequest is made .. the other browsers are delaying it until after the head elemen is done it seems .. why ?
[05:12:47] <CNoS> hello, I have a question about jquery ui, about opening a dialog with a button. I want about 50 of those buttons, for different table childs, to have a button with an "i" (for information).
[05:30:29] <CNoS> Is there anyone here? So many nicknames, so little chat
[05:32:04] <CNoS> I can explain a bit better. I have a PHP script, that selects a lot of rows from an sql database, each of thos rows has several dta connected to it. Each data will have it's own button, or hyperlink for more information.
[05:33:15] <CNoS> When pressing that button, an information box about that specific data comes up, which means each button opens a uniuqe class. So how can I create a new class for each button, on the go at "random". Those buttons will vary each time.
[05:36:12] <cariveri> Hi. does anyone know of a good example to create a editable/variable tree view?
[08:20:48] <CNoS> No answer. So I think I will do it myself. I think I will create a php file which creates a loop to create a new class or id name for each ID in the row. Hopefully it will work.
[08:46:14] <mad_moses> Hi, I am loading my jquery library at the bottom of my html page. Is it possible to write somehow jquerycode in the middle of my html file without moving the jquery library at the top?
[09:57:23] <CNoS> why not use an include file mad_moses?
[10:27:29] <mad_moses> CNoS, I could do this, but i would like to know if this is possible

[12:03:42] <BackEndCoder> hi, first time trying to join more than one data value to a ajax data string.. any help? my array is mashed https://gist.github.com/BackEndCoder/30c5958c8b0bbbf7acada528d3d17124
[12:04:11] <BackEndCoder> i have tried with serilize and val()
[12:24:03] <cuqa_> hello, assuming I wanna check if the object in an array exists, how do I do this easily? .. if (typeof myArray['user17'].name == 'undefined') {} .. does not work
[12:24:30] <cuqa_> try { } catch (e) {} seems to me like a bit overkill

[21:24:38] <wspider> how could I get the class name of an element through jquery?
[21:25:14] <shoky> .attr('class') gets the class attribute
[21:26:21] <wspider> not working for an element with class name "0", I wonder why :\
[21:35:37] <wspider> oh, my fault.. it wasn't a jquery object
[21:38:26] <wspider> I created a jquery object using $('<td>') and then assigned it a class.. how could I retrieve that class?
[21:38:31] <wspider> I mean the class name
[21:42:24] <wspider> hehe, I am suffering :P
[21:46:15] <wspider> nvm, already found out a way
