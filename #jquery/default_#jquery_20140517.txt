[02:31:55] <omfgitsasalmon> Hi, can anyone here help me with some ajax?
[02:33:09] <OnkelTem> Hi
[02:33:20] <omfgitsasalmon> hi
[02:33:29] <omfgitsasalmon>  Can anyone here help me with some ajax?
[02:33:34] <OnkelTem> What file should I include to get Ease-In-Out and other effects working? jQuery 1.8
[02:33:56] <OnkelTem> I just lost in that millions of files
[02:36:34] <OnkelTem> i included jquery.effects.core.min.js and still got no easin effect
[02:42:34] <OnkelTem> Hello?
[02:44:18] <OnkelTem> Ah, I found. I should use 'easeInt' and not 'easein'
[03:14:26] <tenoke> If I have an Object and want to change its values inside a function and only use it there from now on(let's say the name is foo). Should I do var foo = foo at the start of the function to bring it at the current level in the stack in order to access it faster. Does it work that way?
[03:27:56] <_rgn> tenoke: it doesn't. function myfun(foo) { var foo = foo; } doesn't do anything and is wrong
[03:28:27] <_rgn> it's already `foo` in that context
[03:31:36] <tenoke> _rgn: no, I don't mean an object which I've passed to the function. I mean an object which I reference in the function. More like obj = {1:1};  myfun(){var obj = obj;}
[03:33:48] <_rgn> that looks like an antipattern
[03:33:54] <_rgn> why not just pass the obj in the function
[03:34:14] <tenoke> (I don't know why I switched from foo to obj in my example) My question is is it faster here if I declare it like I do myfun(){var obj = obj;  obj[1] = 2;} or if I just straight go myfun(){obj[1] = 2;}
[03:35:02] <tenoke> yeah, I guess passing it in the first place is the normal way to do it, isn't it
[03:35:28] <_rgn> it depends, sometimes you could just use a variable from outer scope
[03:36:18] <_rgn> but i've never seen anyone make it "local" to scope by using var like that
[03:38:41] <_rgn> if it's possible, a function should be 'decoupled' from context. i think there was a word for that
[03:39:04] <tenoke> Well, you often use var to bring a dom element to the top (var this = $(this) or whatever) when you are going to use the variable more than once. I was wondering if this is also a good technique in cases like this
[03:40:02] <_rgn> that's different
[03:41:10] <tenoke> Sure, but doesn't the same principle apply? If I do var ob = obj before doing work on the object, obj should now be at the top and thus faster to work with?
[03:41:27] <_rgn> nope
[03:42:37] <_rgn> var $el = $(this); is matter of DRY, not so much performance
[03:53:15] <forgotmynick> when i resize my browser an element goes missing because the style="display:none;" is added to the element style. how do I find out which script is the culprit?
[04:00:04] <_rgn> forgotmynick: remove stuff until it no longer happens
[04:00:27] <_rgn> also some kind of dom breakpoint might help
[04:00:51] <forgotmynick> _rgn is there any other way like through chrome developer tools?
[04:01:21] <forgotmynick> i'm working on a site that has tens of scripts
[04:03:44] <_rgn> http://cl.ly/image/2o2R3E2c0I14
[04:03:51] <_rgn> do this on the element that is modified
[04:27:23] <forgotmynick> _rgn thank you
[05:29:44] <_rgn> forgotmynick: np
[05:49:41] <cybered2> hello people, i wrote a script that adds and removes rows to a table dynamically. Each row contains form elements. There occurs a problem when adding rows. The input values get reset, when removing a row. is this normal behavior? i remove the rows by calling: "$(this).parent().parent().parent().remove();" which matches a <tr> element.
[05:49:58] <cybered2> *removing
[05:53:10] <Nach0z> o_O
[05:54:54] <cybered2> just found the origin of the problem, was calling another function :P
[05:55:20] <decx> you can do $(this).closest('tr') instead of that parent gauntlet btw
[06:00:21] <cybered2> decx, thank you
[06:02:33] <Nach0z> or you can do something sane with IDs maybe
[07:10:44] <zylophone> is it possible to view all .data for an element from the console?
[07:11:34] <systemfault> Probably
[07:11:43] <systemfault> zylophone: Select the element in the inspector
[07:12:12] <systemfault> Then once it’s selected, write in the console          $($0).data()
[07:13:20] <hazardrix> Hi, is it possible to keep a div persistent over several pages in jquery mobile?
[07:14:22] <zylophone> ahh thanks systemfault
[07:14:39] <systemfault> zylophone: Worked?
[07:15:58] <zylophone> aye
[07:16:23] <zylophone> hazardrix: that kinda isn't how web browsing works
[07:17:16] <hazardrix> zylophone: the header and footer can be kept persistent
[07:18:00] <hazardrix> zylophone: I just dont't want to refresh some content that is the same on every page
[07:20:38] <hazardrix> In my case it's an iframe
[07:21:56] <iDevelop> Guys
[07:22:04] <iDevelop> Can I get your feedback?
[07:22:14] <hazardrix> I mean, if you write a web app, you can dynamically change the content in one div and you have another div that is not in that div - so that one doesn't change
[07:22:28] <hazardrix> I see No problem at all
[07:24:02] <rindolf> iDevelop: hi, with what?
[07:25:18] <iDevelop> rindolf: take a look at http://ilikephp.no-ip.biz/BWBoard/account/login and login with samuel@matrixdevuk.pw | pass and I need feedback on the login animations
[07:29:05] <rindolf> iDevelop: well, I'll need to whitelist JS for that.
[07:29:14] <iDevelop> rindolf: ok
[07:30:53] <rindolf> iDevelop: the login works fine with JS blacklisted.
[07:31:13] <iDevelop> rindolf: yeah, but you won't see the effects
[07:31:20] <iDevelop> enable js to let the jquery to work
[07:34:13] <legrandin> hey guys, im having trouble with json serialization of forms. heres the code; http://jsfiddle.net/F8jfp/ . all i get in the console is [object, object, object], etc
[07:35:20] <legrandin> the jquery is taken from the documentation, with document.ready added
[07:40:05] <iDevelop> legrandin: if you don't NEED a json array, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/F8jfp/2/
[07:42:15] <legrandin> well im making a django application, and i sort of understand json better than i do post data
[07:42:35] <legrandin> so i was hoping for a quick fix i guess
[07:43:40] <legrandin> thanks for the help
[07:45:17] <iDevelop> legrandin: it's quite the same if you're using php, just $_POST['your_field_name']
[07:45:40] <iDevelop> not sure about django though
[07:45:42] <iDevelop> since it's python
[07:45:53] <iDevelop> (IIRC)
[07:46:47] <legrandin> yeah i think its slightly different in django
[07:49:12] <iDevelop> rindolf: did you try it w/ js yet?
[07:49:48] <iDevelop> legrandin: not sure if this helps, but I found this —> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/
[07:50:26] <legrandin> im reading that as we speak! :D
[07:50:49] <legrandin> i think my thought process was, "oh man this would be so cool to get JSON post data i should try that!" and have since failed terrible
[07:50:57] <legrandin> ly
[08:03:15] <iDevelop> legrandin: if I knew more I'd help out some more
[08:07:01] <zylophone> i just hate it when i spend 30 mins narrowing down a bug and thinking i've just got it, when i knock up a test case on jsfiddle, only for it to work :(
[08:09:17] <beancurd> 7heh
[08:46:07] <blez> how can I monitor an element for resize?
[08:47:06] <blez> I did $(element).on("resize" but it doesn't fire
[08:48:15] <decx> unless you're using jquery ui's resizable only window fires a resize event
[08:49:00] <blez> damn.
[08:49:35] <blez> I have: $("#wrapper").animate({ height: '300px' }, 1500, 'easeOutBounce');
[08:49:46] <blez> is there any way to call a function on resize
[08:50:24] <decx> use animates callback
[09:12:04] <blez> I do .height(), but it seems it gets the element's height without the border width
[09:12:59] <blez> do I need outerHeight() >?
[09:13:48] <BillCriswell> decx: Did you see this? Pretty useful: http://www.json-generator.com/
[09:14:03] <BillCriswell> blez: Yes.
[09:14:15] <BillCriswell> If you want the margin as well you can pass outerHeight(true)
[09:21:14] <decx> well i must've been there before because it's in my js whitelist but it looks nicer than anything i tested when i searched for something like it
[09:21:34] <decx> even crossdomain anything when you save one
[09:22:50] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[09:23:02] <BillCriswell> How often do you have to edit your js whitelist?
[09:24:02] <decx> i just add a domain to the whitelist with a rightclick
[09:24:37] <BillCriswell> Ah, easier process than I though.
[09:26:26] <BillCriswell> It sucks, some websites abuse it and others basically require it to work.
[09:27:08] <decx> yeah some blogspam sites have external scripts from 30+ domains
[09:27:39] <decx> with all those trackers and vanity scripts activated chrome is slower than ff even though it's chrome
[09:27:58] <BillCriswell> Yeah, the internet can be terrible.
[09:28:04] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/tbyq2lB.gif
[09:28:22] <zylophone> js whitelist?
[09:28:43] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah nice.
[09:29:11] <zylophone> why are you programming about strawberries?
[09:29:14] <BillCriswell> decx: I wonder if you're like that .5% of the users I come across in statistics with JS disabled.
[09:29:38] <decx> no because we don't allow analytics and therefore don't show up anywhere
[09:29:39] <decx> ^^
[09:30:00] <zylophone> what about images used for users who disable js
[09:30:02] <zylophone> ^^
[09:30:04] <decx> so convinient that they have that on a separate domain :>
[09:30:10] <decx> convenient
[09:30:18] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[09:30:32] <BillCriswell> zylophone: It's a JSON data generator.
[09:30:35] <zylophone> doesn't chrome track every site you go to anyway?
[09:30:38] <decx> why wouldnt i program about strawberries anyway
[09:30:43] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:30:53] <decx> i only use chrome to test webkit
[09:30:59] <decx> ff4life
[09:31:18] <BillCriswell> If firefox opened up faster I might be able to switch.
[09:31:24] <zylophone> <insert joke about ff aging too quickly>
[09:31:36] <decx> and luckily ff is marketleader in germany so that's nice as well
[09:31:51] <zylophone> some hot women don't open up very fast, but i still try and wait
[09:32:05] <decx> yeah ff is about long term relationships
[09:32:13] <decx> meaning you never close your browser or shut down the pc
[09:32:25] <zylophone> hate the defaul tweb developer crap bar
[09:32:26] <BillCriswell> I was in it from the beginning, but all the update your plugin dialogs and shit like that just drove me nuts.
[09:32:27] <zylophone> it's awful
[09:32:39] <BillCriswell> When it was Phoenix maybe?
[09:32:48] <zylophone> i remember opera back in the day. it was lightyears ahead of netscape
[09:33:04] <decx> the devtools may be shit. but they got 3d dom view so ... yeah..
[09:33:18] <zylophone> yeah, never did see the point of that either! ;)
[09:33:18] <BillCriswell> decx: That's been helpful to me like... once.
[09:33:31] <zylophone> LIES!
[09:33:35] <decx> yeah i dont get it
[09:33:39] <decx> but vanity!
[09:33:46] <BillCriswell> zylophone: I think of it as an optimization tool.
[09:33:54] <zylophone> ah ok
[09:34:09] <BillCriswell> zylophone: I could be making that up.
[09:34:10] <zylophone> i think of it as a ms-esque selling point
[09:34:14] <decx> 600 wrapper divs
[09:34:15] <zylophone> hehe
[09:34:15] <BillCriswell> I just like really lean HTML
[09:34:20] <Imaginativeone> join #jqueryui
[09:34:21] <BillCriswell> decx: Exactly.
[09:34:39] <decx> i like concise markup as well
[09:34:45] <decx> :after and :before were a godsend
[09:34:59] <zylophone> i hate bootstraps necessary wrapping to create something
[09:35:03] <BillCriswell> Indeed. The flatter your site the better the markup... maybe
[09:35:19] <BillCriswell> zylophone: Yeah, no fun.
[09:35:43] <decx> necessary evil in mass market products
[09:35:48] <zylophone> is this where pedobear strikes up and says... "mhhh, the flatter the chest, the better the ..."?
[09:35:51] <Imaginativeone> how do I add dynamic content to my jqueryui controls?
[09:36:30] <BillCriswell> zylophone: Let's hope not.
[09:37:01] <zylophone> aye, this is not 4chan
[09:37:26] <decx> the commentator in the barcelona-atletico game just creamed himself
[09:37:44] <zylophone> hot women running?
[09:38:11] <decx> sure... but i think neymar is injured
[09:41:21] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/ravibuna/4/edit?css,output Can you think of any downsides to this approach over changing the text to inputs when you click? This approach seems a lot better to me but I usually see the other way.
[09:43:18] <decx> looks good to me
[09:43:36] <BillCriswell> decx: The only think that popped in my head was screen readers.
[09:45:17] <decx> looks good in fangs
[09:45:29] <decx> Craft Crawford Edit craftcrawford at providco.com Edit plus one left paren nine hundred eighty-nine right paren four hundred thirteen dash three thousand one hundred seventy-seven Edit Lang Erickson Edit langerickson at providco.com Edit
[09:45:48] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[09:54:18] <zylophone> grr. so, i have an issue i just can't reproduce in test code, but in this code somehow screws up!
[09:55:46] <BillCriswell> zylophone: Sounds like a pain in the ass
[09:57:17] <zylophone> BillCriswell: i've thought i had it twice only for test cases to happily work
[10:00:07] <zylophone> is it possible to see all elements that have .data attached?
[10:02:36] <BillCriswell> zylophone: You could maybe do $('*').filter(function(){ return $(this).data(); });
[10:02:52] <BillCriswell> If it's just for finding out something quick and not for like... production.
[10:03:48] <zylophone> yeah, trying to figure stuff out
[10:04:20] <zylophone> wow... thanks! i think
[10:05:02] <BillCriswell> zylophone: I just tried it and I don't think it's right.
[10:06:52] <BillCriswell> zylophone: $('*').filter(function () { return !$.isEmptyObject($(this).data()); }); will do it.
[10:07:03] <BillCriswell> zylophone: http://jsbin.com/pisen/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:09:21] <zylophone> ah thanks
[10:12:15] <zylophone> i guess this was more what i was after - $('*').filter(function(){if (!$.isEmptyObject($(this).data())){console.log($(this).data());}});
[10:12:20] <zylophone> just to output the actual data
[10:12:53] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[10:13:50] <zylophone> well it's confirmed my theory that i screwed up!
[10:15:20] <zylophone> this is the situation i find myself in, but here it's happily working: http://jsfiddle.net/LTL4Q/2/
[10:16:52] <decx> i cant make heads of tail of that
[10:16:59] <decx> or* even
[10:19:44] <BillCriswell> zylophone: What is your goal here?
[10:23:07] <zylophone> BillCriswell: i'm essentially building a set of html from templates, and adding .data to the elements. but the inner elements don't appear to have the .data set outside of the function
[10:23:11] <decx> basicly you can cut out half of that stuff
[10:23:21] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/LTL4Q/3/
[10:24:03] <zylophone> 404
[10:24:33] <zylophone> ahh +decx
[10:25:56] <zylophone> i do like those shortcut objects
[10:26:19] <decx> 1.8+ i think
[11:00:11] <perlite> Hey, im using <input id="pic1" name="file[]" type="file">   and i using data: $(this).serialize()  in ajax however the files are not transmitted. other normal inputs works but files not.
[11:01:12] <krambiorix> hi, how can i enable arrow navigation in autocomplete?
[11:02:12] <systemfault> perlite: You cannot transfer files using jQuery ajax, at least without using the file api (IE10+)
[11:04:14] <perlite> systemfault hmm that suxs .. i wanted to transfer them to my .php file and there upload them ofc ...
[11:05:11] <systemfault> perlite: I know… There’s a way to simulate transfering files asynchronously… but it involves hidden iframes.
[11:05:27] <krambiorix> anyone?
[11:05:40] <systemfault> perlite If you’re interested, take a look at the jquery-iframe-transport plugin
[11:10:20] <Dev0n> is there something like .toggle() that will execute the option actions of something defied rather than show/hide matched elements?
[11:12:21] <perlite> systemfault so for transmitt type="file" inputs with ajax to my .php file to access them with $_FILES[] i have to use this plugin exactly?
[11:12:47] <systemfault> perlite: Yes, unless you don’t need to support older browsers.
[11:13:10] <perlite> systemfault what is the file api ?
[11:13:14] <systemfault> perlite: Current browsers (including IE10+) all support the FileAPi
[11:14:25] <zylophone> can i use jquery to clone an object?
[11:14:36] <zylophone> $(someobj).clone() ain't cutting it!
[11:14:36] <systemfault> perlite: Well, in fact, you don’t even need the FileAPI, only XHR2 + FormData
[11:14:56] <systemfault> zylophone: Clone a DOM node or an JS object?
[11:15:02] <hazardrix> Hi, I'm using filterable with jquery mobile for autocomplete. How can I automatically focus the input field when the page is shown? I tried selecting the input field and .focus(). It didn't work though. Is there an option for that? Here's my site: http://quizprofi.de
[11:15:19] <zylophone> js object
[11:15:30] <systemfault> zylophone: Take a look at .extend
[11:15:32] <perlite> systemfault FormData has a self build in FileApi ? or why here i don't need it.
[11:15:41] <zylophone> thanks i will
[11:16:06] <systemfault> perlite: The FileAPI is to do more complicated things… like reading the content of a input type=“file” and do changes.. You don’t need that.
[11:16:23] <zylophone> i.e. no you can't ;)
[11:16:24] <systemfault> perlite: So, in your case, you only need XHR2 support (For the FormData object)
[11:17:19] <systemfault> zylophone: IIRC…. var copy  = $.extend(true, {}, theObjectToCopy);
[11:17:32] <systemfault> (Remove the “true” if you don’t need a deep copy)
[11:17:46] <perlite> systemfault so i have now a "submit" event and i do $(this).serialize() which gives me all data except files so i can implement the formData inside the ajax and also transmitt it with the already serliazlized ?
[11:18:10] <systemfault> perlite: If you use xhr2, you’re probably better off without using $.ajax.
[11:18:52] <perlite> systemfault ah formData is a newer $.ajax ? which can also transmit data to a .php file like ajax ?
[11:19:01] <systemfault> Not exactly.
[11:19:38] <systemfault> XMLHttpRequest is the object behind $.ajax. This is what you use to send/get stuff to/from the server
[11:19:57] <systemfault> perlite: FormData allows you to serialize a form (or dynamically build one using JS)
[11:20:38] <perlite> systemfault and xhr2 is XMLHttpRequest2 ? a newer ajax ? with more methods or ? :D
[11:21:21] <systemfault> Exactly, the object is still called XMLHttpRequest but it supports new cool stuff like FormData and binary arrays
[11:22:15] <hazardrix> anyone?
[11:22:48] <Bascka> Does anybody know a plugin that will do this kinda "progress" bar https://www.dropbox.com/s/ykmvwp3eo5s19fk/Screenshot%202014-05-16%2012.00.28.png ? I tried doing it with css, but its too hard ><
[11:23:32] <perlite> systemfault ok, but you say leave the ajax but i have still some "validation checks on my inputs which changes" can't i just run formData inside the ajax call or i can use formData also to get result from the .php
[11:23:35] <systemfault> perlite: It also support progress events (You can show the user a progress bar)
[11:23:44] <CrowX-> why is the menu li items height here 22px, when I have set both font-size and line-height to 20px? http://jsfiddle.net/Duzzf/
[11:24:12] <systemfault> perlite: You only need to change the $.ajax to a XMLHttpRequest call…
[11:24:52] <perlite> systemfault $.ajax is xhr no ? ... you said that.
[11:25:19] <systemfault> perlite: Yes. But I don't think $.ajax supports "FormData"
[11:25:37] <perlite> oh wait.
[11:25:39] <systemfault> perlite: Well.. perhaps if you set processData: false
[11:26:01] <perlite> you using formData inside the new xhr right ?  i have to use the js version ..
[11:26:06] <CrowX-> anyone?
[11:26:12] <systemfault> perlite: Let me check something.
[11:26:15] <CrowX-> where are those 2 extra pixels coming from?
[11:26:19] <perlite> systemfault ok ty .
[11:27:23] <krambiorix> i use jquery ui autocomplete , but when i use my arrow down key to navigate, it removes the value inmy input field
[11:29:03] <perlite> systemfault i found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6974684/how-to-send-formdata-objects-with-ajax-requests-in-jquery
[11:29:21] <perlite> systemfault there he is doing like you said proccess data false.
[11:29:32] <systemfault> perlite: Nice :P I was trying to jsfiddle an example :P
[11:29:40] <systemfault> Good to know I was on the right track.
[11:30:19] <perlite> systemfault oh don't wanted to interrupt you :D
[11:30:23] <systemfault> perlite: BTW, in your case, you might want to create your FormData from the "form", it works like .serialize()
[11:30:42] <systemfault> var formData = new FormData($('#my-form').get(0));
[11:31:12] <perlite> systemfault and than just data: formData; right ?
[11:31:19] <systemfault> perlite: Yes.
[11:31:39] <perlite> systemfault thx my friend. alot i gona test it one more question for what is this
[11:31:47] <perlite> systemfault thx my friend. alot i gona test it one more question for what is this (0) ?
[11:32:14] <systemfault> perlite: To get the unjQuery-fied DOM node
[11:32:25] <systemfault> The same as $('#my-form')[0]
[11:32:49] <systemfault> perlite: "Pure DOM" objects don't know about jQuery.
[11:36:17] <perlite> systemfault well yea it works wow, i love formData
[11:36:36] <systemfault> perlite: I love all the new stuff we cannot use if we need to support older IEs.
[11:37:13] <perlite> systemfault well ok i have next trouble, how now to wrap my whole ajax call inside a condition that checks if formData is supported ? i will let them use pure php if formData not supported
[11:37:39] <systemfault> perlite: if ('FormData' in window) {} I guess
[11:38:45] <perlite> systemfault or you know what, i will print a big "GTFO old crap user" to my visitors fu ck that mutha fukas that using old shit. and IE man burn microsoft. :D
[11:38:59] <perlite> sry for my expression.
[11:39:09] <systemfault> IE10+ is fine :P (Even though I hate IE)
[11:40:22] <perlite> systemfault ye but sadly most of people still using IE 6 wow .... i mean they like the simplificy of it :DD:D: haha this got me.
[11:40:49] <Vorspire> i have to agree, being a dedicated anti-IE guy myself, IE 10+ seems pretty rock solid
[11:41:12] <systemfault> perlite: It's not that bad… Nobody but 2 countries in asia still use IE6…. Nobody uses IE7.
[11:41:23] <systemfault> perlite: There's still some usage of IE8 but it's declining
[11:41:43] <Vorspire> half of the govt and educational facilities in the UK still use IE 5 because the licensing is too expensive :<
[11:41:46] <systemfault> IE9 is the first IE that is somewhat decent  (SVG support… HTML5… canvas)
[11:43:46] <zylophone> well bloody finally
[11:44:31] <perlite> no happy end.
[11:45:24] <zylophone> our local library still use xp and ie6 iirc
[11:45:30] <zylophone> maybe ie7.
[11:46:13] <zylophone> Vorspire: that's rubbish. i haven't been in one academic facility that still uses ie5!
[11:47:39] <Vorspire> academic facility, lol
[11:47:42] <Vorspire> big difference
[11:47:51] <Vorspire> i'm talking standard public services
[11:47:54] <Vorspire> public schools
[11:48:05] <Vorspire> a lot of high school IT dept.s still use XP and IE 5
[11:48:37] <Vorspire> small businesses that can't afford to pay for licenses, or the support
[11:48:52] <laravelnewbie> hello
[11:48:58] <laravelnewbie> $('#fl').on("click", ".sended-param", function(){ this doesn't work
[11:48:59] <zylophone> nope, still haven't been in one school that still uses ie5
[11:49:34] <laravelnewbie> i need help
[11:49:37] <zylophone> systemfault: forgot to say thanks, that $.extend did the trick for cloning
[11:49:41] <systemfault> laravelnewbie: It could be anything. Give us more info.
[11:49:47] <systemfault> zylophone: You're welcome.
[11:50:02] <zylophone> i was too busy kicking a bug's arse!
[11:50:07] <systemfault> :D
[11:50:32] <perlite> systemfault by that browser talk i remembered a story at my old school, i mean i was in a pc school and one day our prof. said "all open your browsers" (im from slovakia not all understand english) and one guy didn't know what to do so he asked the prof. what is a browser, the prof. screamed "omfg what a banana are you !" :D god damn that was a 10 min. laugth in the class...
[11:50:44] <zylophone> and in english schools, IT is called ICT ;)
[11:51:09] <Vorspire> I know that, considering I got the 4 NVQ's associated with it over 10 years ago...
[11:51:12] <laravelnewbie> My html is loaded with AJAX and generated an underscore.js. The fact that the click event will not fire on the generated elements. What do I do?
[11:51:17] <Vorspire> but yeah
[11:51:23] <systemfault> perlite: Wow :)
[11:51:57] <systemfault> laravelnewbie: Try to bind the listener on the body instead of #fl
[11:52:28] <systemfault> laravelnewbie: $('body').on('click', '#fl .sended-params', function() {...
[11:52:48] <zylophone> haha, what's an nvq?
[11:53:02] <systemfault> laravelnewbie: BTW… totally unrelated but.. you might want to change 'sended' to 'sent' :P
[11:53:12] <zylophone> doesn't it teach you how to type your name in word, add two numbers together in excel etc
[11:53:26] <zylophone> (i know what an nvq is btw)
[11:53:50] <zylophone> it's all about cida/dida and the new ict curriculum now which 75% of ict teachers don't know how to teach
[11:54:02] <Vorspire> they are completely useless qualifications imo
[11:54:16] <zylophone> any ict qualification is useless imo
[11:54:22] <laravelnewbie> systemfault Now click at all does not work.
[11:54:22] <Vorspire> agreed lol
[11:54:47] <zylophone> but, it doesn't stop me from wanting to set up a hackerspace!
[11:55:49] <zylophone> gah. this one issue has been closed and opened about 4 times... it's 'that' issue. but i think i got it this time!
[11:56:38] <laravelnewbie> $('body').on('click', '.sended-param', function() { now the event is not even works on existing html
[11:56:41] <perlite> anyone can suggest me a good website for test my js on IE 6 ? or the best way is to install it anyway i have already IE10 installed.
[11:56:58] <perlite> i want to test my js shout ..
[11:57:01] <nielsnl> Hello does someone known an example to use the ui menu as popup/context menu?
[11:57:56] <systemfault> perlite: IE6 is only used in china, do you care?
[11:58:09] <systemfault> perlite: Like, it shouldn't be legal to use XP at this point.
[11:58:17] <perlite> systemfault acutaly not but i wanted to test if(window.FormData === undefined)
[11:58:36] <systemfault> Ah
[11:58:37] <perlite> systemfault if that works ... and i can't test it since i have all supporting browsers.
[11:58:45] <zylophone> aren't there about 1.2 billion in china?
[11:58:49] <laravelnewbie> [code]test[/code]
[11:59:06] <systemfault> perlite: If you have IE, you could use its emulation mode to emulate IE7/IE8
[11:59:11] <zylophone> perlite: set up a vm
[11:59:17] <zylophone> vmware / virtualbox
[11:59:24] <zylophone> become friends with virtual machines
[11:59:35] <perlite> systemfault emulation mode ? ok i go google it.
[12:00:06] <systemfault> zylophone: Yes… 22% of their computer users use IE6
[12:00:49] <zylophone> i think for field equipment with expensive equipment such as mapping software, i don't see any need to upgrade windows versions if it does what you want
[12:00:55] <laravelnewbie> http://laravel.io/bin/dmnkW
[12:01:01] <laravelnewbie> paste code
[12:01:06] <laravelnewbie> i pasted
[12:01:20] <zylophone> the software is probably written for a certain windows' version, and no need to waste money on it just because
[12:01:20] <systemfault> zylophone: Sure, you're right… but anyway, these machines shouldn't go on the internet.
[12:02:05] <zylophone> sure, but if it did, you wouldn't be caring what it looked like
[12:02:21] <zylophone> i still think ALL websites should have those grey tiled backgrounds, with serif fonts text
[12:02:22] <systemfault> zylophone: lol, it's not about that.
[12:02:30] <systemfault> zylophone: It's about security.
[12:02:42] <zylophone> that way maybe people will realise it's all about the content, not a photograph of your macbook and your wooden floor
[12:03:00] <systemfault> zylophone: You don't surf the web on a machine having an OS that doesn't have security updates.
[12:03:07] <zylophone> ah ok. well, yeah, all systems have security issues
[12:03:23] <zylophone> android technically doesn't have security updates ;
[12:03:24] <systemfault> zylophone: Sure… the problem is when "they're" known and unpatched.
[12:03:29] <laravelnewbie> i'am sorry this new paste http://laravel.io/bin/EG2L5
[12:03:34] <laravelnewbie> i need help
[12:03:38] <systemfault> The android ecosystem is retarded.
[12:03:45] <zylophone> somebody i need
[12:03:57] <zylophone> that it is
[12:06:02] <systemfault> Android has three types of users: 1) Geeks 2)  People who don't give a shit about smartphones so they take the cheapest thing that makes calls 3) Poor people who can't afford a good smartphone… (iPhone)
[12:06:33] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: is #filter in the response from your first ajax call?
[12:07:57] <zylophone> i don't know, iphones are harder to customise than android
[12:08:08] <zylophone> oh, if you customise your phone, i guess that makes you a geek!
[12:08:12] <systemfault> zylophone: Then you're a 1)
[12:08:14] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell yes
[12:08:18] <zylophone> yeah :)
[12:08:41] <Sergonium> wouldnt group 2 just pick a non smart phone?
[12:08:41] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell oh no
[12:08:47] <laravelnewbie> second
[12:08:48] <zylophone> i don't understand the iphone thing though. it's more a culture than anything else i think
[12:08:49] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: Yeah I'm looking through again.
[12:08:53] <Sergonium> you still have lots of those of like 20 bucks
[12:08:58] <systemfault> Sergonium: They're difficult to get(here at least)
[12:09:13] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: The inputs are in the ajax call right?
[12:09:24] <zylophone> Sergonium: they'd still be using their nokia 3310's!
[12:09:37] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell yes
[12:09:39] <BillCriswell> That you're checking and then kind of submitting right away?
[12:09:50] <laravelnewbie> yes
[12:09:56] <Sergonium> its difficult to get with a way over priced phone company contracts yes, but you can still find them simlock free about everywhere
[12:10:15] <laravelnewbie> underscore generated html and I can't access them
[12:10:35] <laravelnewbie> the click event is not working for them
[12:11:37] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell I test if a variable is equal to null
[12:12:12] <laravelnewbie> it can be null
[12:12:14] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: You're doing a lot of weird things here.
[12:12:15] <Sergonium> but i think the whole sim only contracts thing is not big at all in the USA
[12:12:40] <zylophone> http://laravel.com/ -> VERY broken in ff
[12:12:53] <zylophone> not a good start
[12:13:15] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell But html is generated and displayed on the page as it should.
[12:13:36] <Sergonium> there every consumer just goes with the flock and gets a 50 bucks a month plan with everything included (including a phone you end up paying off twice within the contract period)
[12:14:04] <zylophone> i've always liked the concept of payasyougo
[12:14:09] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: Right, but I'm not sure things are happening the way you expect.
[12:14:22] <zylophone> but then, 10gbp lasts you about 10 minutes
[12:14:38] <zylophone> 1 min of browsing costs like 1gbp. it's ridiculous
[12:14:41] <systemfault> Sergonium: In the US, you still get f'ed. I personally bought an iphone 5s from tmobile because they were supposed to be unlocked… FALSE.
[12:15:05] <Sergonium> ouch
[12:15:13] <systemfault> Sergonium: Ended up paying $100 to get it unlocked by third-party because it was difficult to make it unlocked by tmobile.
[12:15:20] <zylophone> no consumer rights?
[12:15:34] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: Should all checkboxes be checked?
[12:15:38] <BillCriswell> At the end of this.
[12:15:44] <zylophone> see, if you bought a nexus, you wouldn't have had that problem ;)
[12:15:58] <Sergonium> lol
[12:16:11] <systemfault> zylophone: So it's the fault of the phone, not the cellphone company :P
[12:16:34] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell No. Only 2. preset1 and preset2
[12:18:13] <systemfault> zylophone: In any case… despite that, people in the US don't pay a lot for their cellphone plans compared to canadians (like me)
[12:18:14] <laravelnewbie> if preset1 != null - generated html with preset1 if preset2 != null generated html with preset2
[12:18:23] <systemfault> zylophone: In Canada, we get raped.
[12:20:29] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell $('body').on('click', '.sended-param', function() { if I do so, click the event does not fire. If so $ ('. Sended-param'). On ('click', function () {then click event does not work on the generated html
[12:25:05] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: It wouldn't matter how the html was generated if you bind the event on the body.
[12:25:45] <laravelnewbie> but it does not work at all
[12:26:09] <zylophone> systemfault: that's nothing, in the uk, we're raped, in every hole
[12:26:15] <zylophone> yes, even the nose...
[12:26:26] <zylophone> (the english have a saying... to pay through the nose) :)
[12:26:44] <zylophone> though, it doesn't mean that, probably
[12:27:14] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: I think you're issue is how you're handlin the ajax requests.
[12:29:09] <tw2113> i wonder if laravelnewbie uses laravel
[12:29:28] <laravelnewbie> yes i use laravel
[12:29:30] <tw2113> just a hunch
[12:29:34] <tw2113> :D
[12:29:42] <BillCriswell> If I do $.ajax({...}); $('.radio-input-from-ajax-request').prop('checked', true); There's no guarantee that I'll be able to selected it.
[12:31:52] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell I checked the data arrives. And html generated and inserted into page. And then when I click on the new elements, the event is not triggered. But if I click on the old elements - works.
[12:33:40] <laravelnewbie> Events do not work for the newly added html
[12:33:41] <laravelnewbie> Events do not work for the newly added html
[12:34:28] <tw2113> probably not receiving the new click handlers properly
[12:34:33] <tw2113> er click events
[12:34:50] <tw2113> i think it those cases it's good to use deferred stuff?
[12:35:27] <tw2113> add the click handler to an element that's persistent on the page, and then find the newly generated selector and act on that afterwards
[12:35:34] <laravelnewbie> yes. But I can not make it work. So I did it does not work on new elements
[12:35:52] <tw2113> $('body').on('click','.mydiv',function(){ });
[12:36:04] <laravelnewbie> doesn't work
[12:36:11] <laravelnewbie> i trying
[12:36:18] <tw2113> just checking
[12:36:48] <laravelnewbie> I tested many times. If I do, the event does not work
[12:37:01] <laravelnewbie> at all
[12:37:11] <BillCriswell> laravelnewbie: http://jsbin.com/xagelito/1/edit Here is a very basic demo of even delegation which is what you're doing with sended-param, it works.
[12:41:35] <laravelnewbie> BillCriswell apparently the case in the query or template. Your code works for me. Thanks
[12:43:02] <BillCriswell> The ending to Lethal Weapon is hilarious.
[12:54:40] <perlite> can i set a php $_SESSION[] with javascript ?
[12:58:40] <shoky> no. you can send a request to the server and have the server do that
[13:01:35] <BillCriswell> They're heeerreeee. NERDS.
[13:08:03] <perlite> how to load a new page ? for example im at www.mysite.com/1 and i want to run from js that it reloads and now www.mysite.com/2
[13:08:36] <decx> i use a link, and i don't even need js
[13:10:02] <perlite> decx i want when the ajax is finished and no errors occured i want that it reloads the page and php takes over and proccess :)
[13:10:47] <decx> window.location
[13:19:51] <perlite> hmm some php user which using jquery here?
[13:20:17] <astroo-> hello people
[13:21:01] <systemfault> perlite: What's up?
[13:21:40] <perlite> systemfault i have a problem i run a ajax on test.php here i set a $_SESSION[] than i window.location.replace but the session is not set...
[13:22:16] <perlite> systemfault im sure you asking why i doing this, well i like to continue now with php so i handle on the php side now that's why i trying to set a $_SESSION .
[13:23:38] <systemfault> perlite: Hmm, you set session data with the ajax call, then you redirect to a new page but you lose the session data?
[13:23:55] <systemfault> perlite: Do you actually have a session? (session_start?)
[13:24:03] <perlite> systemfault yes, on #javascript they told me not to use .replace but use instead window.location.href
[13:24:14] <perlite> systemfault oh man thx i forgot session start in the ajax file.
[13:24:23] <systemfault> Ajax file?
[13:24:27] <systemfault> You mean, the PHP file?
[13:24:30] <perlite> systemfault god damn ... sry ye the ajax.php :D
[13:24:32] <perlite> ye php :D
[13:24:36] <systemfault> Ahh
[13:24:36] <perlite> i call them ajax files :D
[13:25:16] <systemfault> Glad I was able to help even though my PHP is rusty (Mainly using nodejs these days)
[13:27:50] <perlite> systemfault thx bro... i using normally a template engine but i forgot that ajax files need all initalization again ....
[13:28:11] <perlite> systemfault by the way you using nodejs to build a complete website??
[13:28:52] <systemfault> perlite: The one I'm working one has a json API written in Java and node.js servers consume it to display the pages.
[13:29:26] <systemfault> Basically, node.js is used as the glue between 5-6 different Java-based services…
[13:29:48] <perlite> systemfault so that's the new world basically a json api and from this json api you create the website. cool
[13:30:23] <perlite> systemfault but is node.js secure ? i mean javascript is a client side program language or im wrong ?
[13:30:39] <shoky> is php secure?
[13:31:18] <perlite> shoky there are holes but with propper knowledge they are gone.
[13:31:19] <shoky> javascript was a client side language. now it's not anymore
[13:32:27] <systemfault> perlite: It's as secure as anything else… I mean, when you think about it, a huge class of security issues are SQL injections…
[13:32:44] <systemfault> perlite: No matter what language you use, it's the programmer that makes the difference.
[13:32:57] <systemfault> No language is going to protect you from that.
[13:33:00] <perlite> systemfault true ...
[13:33:18] <DeltaHeavy> Is it best to use .on() events if possible when the event is going to be attached to a bunch of different elements?
[13:33:38] <systemfault> perlite: JS is async… which can be a pain sometimes but it's bearable once you use promises
[13:34:20] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: .on does both "normal event handling" and "event delegation" depending on the syntax you use. So I don't understand the question.
[13:35:00] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: But if an event is going to be attached to a bunch of elements, use the "event delegation" version of .on
[13:35:51] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: So the event delegation version on .on would be like    $('form').on('click', '.drop', function () {       ?
[13:35:52] <systemfault> Which is parentNode.on(eventName, targetSelector, handler) instead of $(targetSelector).on(eventName, handler)
[13:36:02] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: Yes, exactly.
[13:36:03] <DeltaHeavy> Awesome, gotcha
[13:36:31] <DeltaHeavy> systemfault: Is this even preferred if it means me attach it to <body>?
[13:36:49] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: For a lot of elements? Sure!
[13:37:04] <DeltaHeavy> How many would you say? 4+? 3?
[13:37:35] <systemfault> DeltaHeavy: Depending on what you're doing, even 1 can be enough to consider using event delegation :P
[13:38:01] <DeltaHeavy> I'll work this into my future code. Thanks!
[13:44:21] <astroo-> can i talk about my free project for all?
[13:45:47] <BillCriswell> astroo-: You mean for help or just to like... talk about it?
[13:46:36] <astroo-> to help my project
[13:47:15] <astroo-> and say what it is
[13:47:23] <BillCriswell> Oh, yeah that's fine. I'd just try to keep it related to jQuery.
[13:49:18] <astroo-> Those who want to help in a project that will be the "home" of peoples with chat system and a center of information, private me please
[13:49:34] <astroo-> BillCriswell  thanks
[14:17:16] <astroo-> bye people and thanks

[16:20:50] <shoky> your log on line 196 is logging an empty jquery object
[16:21:28] <motaka2> shoky: I feel retarded do you think if I have to stop programming ?
[16:21:50] <tw2113> why would we suggest something like that

[19:54:13] <JoeQuery> Hello there. Having a strange issue. Within an event handler within this external script, if I execute $(e.target).children(), I get results that look like [prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: span.hljs-string] instead of standard selector results. However, if I make e.target a global variable and access it from the console, $(e.target) returns regular selector results.
[19:54:35] <JoeQuery> Any common errors I should look out for that results in such behavior?
[20:05:51] <Arby01> just guessing here but is it maybe a bubbling issue?  and here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11386295/jquery-selector-result-is-prevobject-e-fn-e-init3-how-do-i-get-an-element-fro indicates maybe $(e.target)[0] would get you there?

[21:40:27] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[21:57:23] <JLT> I've been working on a basic textbased rpg game, they are common but I'm treating it as a fun personal project. Ran into a small issue where .attack-log will not autoscroll to the bottom. You can see the code for attackLogAppend down the bottom of the Game.js file: http://178.78.101.246/RPG/ simply click on Level 1, and it'll generate a long log but remains scrolled to the top.
[21:58:06] <JLT> The same 2 lines used to autoscroll it i used in a jsfiddle file and that works fine. http://jsfiddle.net/D2H6C/ this led me to believe the issue is else where but cannot figure out why/how/where
[22:27:20] <JLT> Oh got it. I put the scroll on the wrong box.
[22:45:13] <fattest> If I click the play button, I want the text of "hi" to change to the name of the song, just like the <li> a. How can I do this? http://jsfiddle.net/vkMqR/946/
[23:32:13] <fattest> any help would be appreciated
[23:58:54] <brunoais> fattest, checking...
