[01:37:30] <ClydeSlims> Uhkis, whats wrong with it?

[01:37:51] <ClydeSlims> Oh damn
[01:38:09] <ClydeSlims> thank you lol
[02:16:54] <coldhead> sweet ops
[04:16:40] <G66K> hello good people :)
[04:17:05] <G66K> i was wondering how to select form that has method="get"
[04:24:06] <milton> G66K: $("[method='get']")
[04:26:32] <Cork> well form[method="get"] else it could match other elements
[04:26:37] <Cork> but ya
[04:30:04] <G66K> https://jsfiddle.net/49aam63e/
[04:30:18] <G66K> seems like that not function
[04:30:54] <chipyy> Hey, i would just like to ask, how to check if the value of input is ' ' or only ' '?
[04:32:02] <Cork> G66K: works fine here https://jsfiddle.net/49aam63e/3/
[04:32:37] <G66K> chippy if( !$(this).val() ) { rest code here}
[04:32:47] <Cork> no
[04:32:55] <Cork> that checks if the input has value
[04:33:12] <Cork> chipyy: what is it you actually want to do?
[04:33:21] <Cork> cause that check doesn't really make sense
[04:33:24] <chipyy> i already got answer ;)
[04:33:40] <chipyy> if somebody will write in input only ' '
[04:34:07] <Cork> why specially target ' '?
[04:34:17] <Cork> why not '.' for example
[04:35:28] <chipyy> uf i didnt think about it :D
[04:35:58] <Cork> and that is why i questioned what it is you actually wanted
[04:36:13] <G66K> Cork: thanks i forget to print it
[04:36:18] <chipyy> for register form i need so that somebody wont input crap
[04:36:50] <chipyy> or again should i check it just on server side? :D
[04:36:59] <possbiru> HI!
[04:37:07] <G66K> Cork: its clearly he want to check input field :P
[04:37:13] <possbiru> when u first click add it add 2: https://jsfiddle.net/89dsx6me/
[04:37:19] <Cork> chipyy: you must check it server side, but you should check it client side to give a quicker answer
[04:37:21] <G66K> i smell it
[04:37:35] <Cork> chipyy: though checking that they don't input crap is close to impossible
[04:38:07] <chipyy> i know that, but i want to prevent somelittle crap XD
[04:38:23] <Cork> possbiru: you have a class called {{field.name}} ??
[04:38:29] <Cork> ah, no template
[04:38:41] <possbiru> ye, template
[04:38:46] <possbiru> i just left 1 line there
[04:39:08] <possbiru> it does the same thing with a bunch of data in it..
[04:39:36] <chipyy> cork, on my place what would you do if you would check inputs?
[04:39:58] <Cork> chipyy: i would add those checks as they encounter
[04:40:09] <chipyy> for what would you be checking? ofcourse if it isnt empty,, for email structure
[04:40:11] <Cork> cause adding hunderds of them just to have the user enter 101 is kinda pointless
[04:40:11] <chipyy> what else?
[04:41:34] <chipyy> and how you mean as they encounter? encouter with what?
[04:42:22] <possbiru> Cork: solved, it is because of many elements with row class i belive, ty anyway
[04:42:55] <Cork> possbiru: no i don't think so
[04:43:07] <Cork> it shouldn't affect this
[04:43:16] <Cork> btw let isn't cross browser safe yet
[04:43:29] <Cork> (close too when ie10 dies)
[04:43:31] <possbiru> well.. i added a class to the first .row element and made it the click trigger so to say
[04:43:49] <Cork> that is more of a hack, give me a min
[04:44:36] <possbiru> Cork: kk
[04:44:42] <Cork> possbiru: ah, i might have misunderstood your comment
[04:44:55] <Cork> possbiru: the problem is that you bind the click handle to multiple parents
[04:45:06] <Cork> the simplest solution is to move it to the form instead
[04:45:14] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/89dsx6me/1/
[04:45:35] <possbiru> well, you broke it xD
[04:45:40] <Cork> ... except it is an id >_<'
[04:45:48] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/89dsx6me/2/
[04:45:52] <possbiru> yea i noticed :D
[04:46:16] <possbiru> Ty mate ^^
[04:46:20] <Cork> np
[04:46:35] <chipyy> https://jsfiddle.net/m16f7n0r/ , why it doesnt work !variable.val() in jquery or i am doing it wrong?
[04:47:08] <chipyy> and also i am reding about if (variable===undefined) it also checks for the same as if !variable.val())
[04:47:10] <Cork> chipyy: you can check the structure of emails (though you can't check much more then that it has a @ and at least one character on each side)
[04:47:33] <Cork> chipyy: variable === undefined won't ever be true for value from an input field
[04:47:39] <Cork> chipyy: cause it won't ever be undefined
[04:47:48] <Cork> (unless the field doesn't exist at all)
[04:48:47] <Cork> chipyy: the only real thing you can check there is that the country is a valid country, the email is at least "a@a" or similar
[04:48:56] <possbiru> BTW, who cares about IE 10 anyway :D:D
[04:48:58] <chipyy> my mistake cork: if (typeof name != 'undefined' && name)
[04:49:00] <Cork> and the passwords follow your requirements
[04:49:09] <Cork> chipyy: that is the same thing
[04:49:12] <Cork> it won't work
[04:49:46] <chipyy> i am reading from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2647867/how-to-determine-if-variable-is-undefined-or-null
[04:50:03] <Cork> ya, but you aren't working with variables in that sense
[04:50:13] <Cork> you're working with input field values
[04:50:32] <chipyy> yes but before that i saved input values in variables
[04:50:36] <Cork> and unless you code errors and remove a field
[04:50:39] <Cork> it will always be ""
[04:50:45] <Cork> chipyy: doesn't matter
[04:51:06] <Cork> the variable will always be "" at worst
[04:51:10] <chipyy> ok, now i see how big rookie i am :D
[04:51:14] <Cork> so never EVER undefined
[04:51:21] <chipyy> ok
[04:51:34] <Cork> chipyy: you don't want name.val() though
[04:51:39] <Cork> cause name is a string
[04:51:45] <Cork> same with all the other variables
[04:51:54] <Cork> so just !name for example
[04:52:11] <Cork> but i would prob check name.length < 3 or so
[04:52:13] <chipyy> i had that before, but if i wrote ' ' it passes as it is ok
[04:52:25] <chipyy> i can also ad 3x ' ' and it would pass
[04:52:30] <chipyy> if i set !name
[04:52:40] <Cork> you can pass anything with !name
[04:52:47] <Cork> as long as it isn't "0" or ""
[04:53:06] <chipyy> about 0 i dont know , but about ' ' yes
[04:53:11] <Cork> !name just means falsy
[04:54:03] <Cork> so what you prob need to do is a regex replace, remove all the characters you don't care about
[04:54:10] <Cork> and count the numbers left
[04:54:11] <chipyy> so its better that i should check like this:!("#name").val()
[04:54:39] <chipyy> in that case it wont pass if i input only ' '
[04:54:48] <Cork> so ex $('#name').val().replace(/[^[a-z]+/,'').length > 1
[04:55:08] <Cork> it will still allow a user to enter "a"
[04:55:21] <Cork> but again, you can't really prevent that
[04:55:45] <chipyy> can you paste me some link or give me any info how this regex works?
[04:56:13] <Cork> opps just noticed i typoed
[04:56:24] <Cork> $('#name').val().replace(/[[^a-z]+/g,'').length > 1
[04:56:27] <Cork> is what you want
[04:56:38] <Cork> what it does is it removes all characters not matching a-z
[04:56:48] <Duikb00t> if ( $(this).checked ) {  can we do also: if ( $(this).UNchecked ) { ?
[04:56:52] <Cork> you might want to include large characters too
[04:57:02] <Cork> Duikb00t: there are no $(this).checked
[04:57:10] <Cork> what you want is this.checked
[04:57:27] <Cork> and for the second, no just use !this.checked
[04:57:49] <Duikb00t> Lol when I do this.checked the whole system broke :D
[04:58:08] <Cork> Duikb00t: is this a form checkbox?
[04:58:15] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/oP4UH   yesss
[04:58:16] <Cork> (or a option)
[04:58:38] <chipyy> cork, i still dont understand what that regex means :) (/[[^a-z]+/g,'') but i guess letters from a-z
[04:58:57] <Cork> Duikb00t: well it is what you want, so you need to figure out why it broke it
[04:59:03] <Duikb00t> Now some input fields render when you check the box, when you uncheck it I want to clear all input fields.
[04:59:12] <Duikb00t> $(this) is wrong?
[04:59:13] <Cork> chipyy: i just told you
[04:59:25] <Duikb00t> > http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1051782/jquery-this-vs-this
[04:59:35] <Cork> Duikb00t: $(this) gives you a jquery wrapped element, and jquery doesn't exposes any checked properties
[04:59:42] <Duikb00t> thb I was thinking $(this) and this are the same
[04:59:55] <Duikb00t> oh :) ok
[05:00:06] <Cork> so if($(this).checked) will always never execute
[05:00:12] <Cork> cause !!undefined == false
[05:00:39] <Cork> Duikb00t: $(this)[0] === this
[05:00:55] <chipyy> ah sorry i didnt see it.. if (!$("#name").val())  i tested it and if i entered ' ', it passes like its everything ok, but i dont want this...
[05:00:58] <Cork> $(this) is basically the same as $.fn
[05:01:08] <possbiru> not really a jquery thing, but #gs-form > .gs-row:first-child .delete-gs { display: none; } wont work... if u remove first-child, everything gets hidden
[05:01:12] <TimCoal> is console.log() known to strip line-feeds?
[05:01:21] <Cork> Duikb00t: except it has a list elements with one element that is this
[05:01:47] <Duikb00t> Is it strange if I don't understand that from the first time? :D
[05:01:48] <Cork> possbiru: make a jsfiddle with the problem
[05:02:30] <Cork> Duikb00t: it is fairly common for users that start with jquery, and haven't used javascript without jquery to get confused by that
[05:02:49] <Duikb00t> I have done js without jquery but not that far just basic selectors etc before I started doing jquery
[05:03:01] <Cork> TimCoal: no it doesn't
[05:03:10] <Cork> TimCoal: btw do you really mean line-feeds?
[05:03:22] <Cork> meaning \r
[05:03:30] <Cork> cause that isn't commonly used
[05:03:35] <TimCoal> yea
[05:03:48] <Cork> it might be stripped by the browser
[05:04:02] <Cork> donno, it is extreamly rarely used at all
[05:04:16] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/  doing some basic shizzle
[05:04:33] <Cork> it is basically a pointless character that is only used on windows
[05:04:41] <TimCoal> i'm trying to break up the output of .stringify(bigjsObj) with line breaks
[05:04:59] <Cork> TimCoal: you want \n not \r
[05:05:48] <Cork> Duikb00t: you seam confused what this is
[05:05:59] <Duikb00t> yes
[05:06:00] <TimCoal> yea started with that, moved on to \r\n, neither get me my line breaks
[05:06:12] <chipyy> cork: $('#name').val().replace(/[[^a-z]+/g,'').length > 1   <<<< about this, because i am from country which uses č,ž,š and in your case this letter are invalid, so its should be made for utf8 style :)
[05:06:15] <Cork> Duikb00t: this is a "scope" variable for a function connected to an object
[05:06:40] <Cork> so function a() { this doesn't exist, so it defaults to window }
[05:06:42] <TimCoal> its only needed to look at the dom so i can hack it for now
[05:07:06] <Duikb00t> Why to window and not to #document
[05:07:14] <Cork> Duikb00t: while var a = { b: function() { here this is a } }; a.b()
[05:07:37] <yaeykay> Hi guys please help, not adding the incremented value of counter to my htmlTemplate http://laravel.io/bin/YyjV8#13-14,57-64
[05:08:07] <TimCoal> learnt stuff from dumping the DOM nodes
[05:08:43] <Cork> Duikb00t: line 1 is window, cause there is object connected there
[05:08:50] <Cork> Duikb00t: on line 3 it is document
[05:08:53] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/3/
[05:09:01] <Duikb00t> Setting up some learning example for myself
[05:09:01] <Cork> except it is document wrapped in jquery
[05:09:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: also the reason this is document there is cause jquery assigns it
[05:09:38] <chipyy> Cork: your replace has totaly failed, even if i input:chipyy is dumb    <<<it returns me that this is false...
[05:09:54] <Duikb00t> Jquery says: this == #document by default.
[05:10:05] <Duikb00t> JS says: this == window by default.
[05:10:07] <Duikb00t> Right?
[05:10:12] <Cork> Duikb00t: what it does is when it calls the callback function it calls callback.call(this.element)
[05:10:19] <Cork> Duikb00t: no
[05:10:25] <Cork> there isn't a default
[05:10:31] <Cork> there is a fallback if there isn't one
[05:10:34] <Cork> not the same thing
[05:11:06] <Duikb00t> 'this' is not easy to understand :D damn
[05:11:18] <Cork> Duikb00t: it is fairly easy actually, give me a min
[05:12:21] <yaeykay> Hi guys please help, not adding the incremented value of counter to my htmlTemplate http://laravel.io/bin/YyjV8#13-14,57-64
[05:13:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/4/
[05:13:44] <Cork> ah, one more case
[05:14:48] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/5/
[05:14:49] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/5/ sweet
[05:14:53] <Cork> does that make any sense?
[05:15:30] <Duikb00t> function a(arg) { return this == arg }
[05:15:46] <Duikb00t> function a(this) {return this}
[05:15:49] <Duikb00t> == the same?
[05:15:50] <Cork> no
[05:15:58] <Duikb00t> Im thinking maybe to much php?
[05:15:59] <Cork> check the console.log lines
[05:16:03] <Cork> those are what matters
[05:16:39] <Cork> Duikb00t: 'this' is a special variable in javascript
[05:16:42] <Cork> defined by the caller
[05:16:52] <Cork> not the function declaration
[05:17:06] <Duikb00t> In PHP it references 'the current object'
[05:17:29] <Cork> ya, it does in class oriented languages
[05:17:37] <Cork> javascript is a prototype oriented language
[05:17:44] <Cork> so it works a little differently
[05:18:14] <chipyy> could somebody tell me how can i check if input contains only ' ', !("#name").val() <- this isnt ok because it passes
[05:18:25] <Cork> Duikb00t: so var obj{ a: function() { this == obj } };
[05:18:33] <Cork> opps
[05:18:36] <Cork> Duikb00t: so var obj = { a: function() { this == obj } };
[05:18:42] <chipyy> corks idea with replaces also doesnt help, because if there is any ' ' it return false
[05:19:01] <Cork> Duikb00t: but var obj = { a: function() { this == obj } }; var z = obj.a; z() here this isn't defined
[05:19:54] <Duikb00t> 'starting to understand it '
[05:23:56] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/6/
[05:25:22] <yaeykay> #laravel
[05:25:31] <Duikb00t> yaeykay:  issues?
[05:27:43] <_Justice_> Um I got ajax calls that returns a promise with .promise() I then push that promise into an array and then use $.when(arr).done(func(res) but console log on that and i got empty objecs.
[05:28:43] <yaeykay> @Duikb00t not incrementing my counter in htmlTemplate http://laravel.io/bin/YyjV8#13-14,57-64
[05:28:52] <codecutter> following line should remove the class when the cursor is on textarea.  It works but is taking unusually long,   this.on('keydown keypress', { textArea : function(){ this.$node.removeClass('box'); }});
[05:30:22] <G66K> whats the best way to disable before when page load
[05:31:06] <chipyy> can i ask why everbody ignores me?
[05:31:09] <Duikb00t> Cork:  https://jsfiddle.net/3auxqh37/7/ Can I be sure my value is empty now? :)
[05:31:32] <Duikb00t> You only want ' ' characters as input? chipyy
[05:32:14] <G66K> chipyy: the only reason could same question repeated
[05:32:47] <chipyy> no,, i want to prevent that, G66K none of any solution which Cork and else pasted didnt help
[05:33:01] <Duikb00t> setup some small example in a fiddle chipyy people like that
[05:33:12] <G66K> chipyy: first off you missiong the dollar sign !("#name").val()
[05:33:29] <chipyy> !name or !$("#name").val() doesnt work
[05:33:29] <G66K> that should be !$("#name").val()
[05:33:51] <chipyy> i had that and if i entered 3x ' '  it would pass
[05:34:37] <Justice> The code looks something like this: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/23084427/
[05:34:40] <chipyy> and also Cork idead with  regex wouldnt be ok, if i entered : chippy noob it would return as false
[05:34:51] <chipyy> because it cointains ' '
[05:35:14] <G66K> $("#name").val().trim() == ""
[05:35:17] <G66K> try this
[05:36:14] <G66K> this another way
[05:37:04] <G66K> if(!$("#name").val().match(/^\s*$/)){        }
[05:37:18] <G66K> add g could be global
[05:37:22] <G66K> if(!$("#name").val().match(/^\s*$/g)){        }
[05:37:22] <chipyy> the first option with trim is very good
[05:37:47] <chipyy> and i see it also check if is empty, so there are two kill on one swipe :D
[05:38:09] <chipyy> now i must just read what trim function does
[05:38:24] <G66K> its remove tails space
[05:38:47] <chipyy> jep just read it
[05:38:49] <Justice> cant you just use if(!!$(input).val().trim())
[05:38:51] <Justice> ?
[05:40:49] <G66K> Justice: you could if you would
[05:41:03] <G66K> for now im facing a lil problem by myself
[05:41:12] <G66K> i want to disable some forms when page load
[05:41:21] <G66K> ready event seems not functioning
[05:41:57] <chipyy> what about if u use function body onload() and there prevent it?
[05:42:04] <jomofcw> Using the jQuery plugin "free transform" I would like to bind an event on the control that enable me to know when it is "clicked". But I cant use "mousedown" and "mouseup" event, because, as the cursor won't be over the target element when click release, the "mouseup" event won't perform...
[05:48:10] <chipyy> G66K trim function delete ' ' only on start of the input right?
[05:49:22] <Justice> anyone got any idea about the $.when why it returns empty objects?
[06:02:21] <FilipNortic_> Justice: If no arguments are passed to jQuery.when(), it will return a resolved Promise.
[06:02:22] <Cork> Justice: $.when should give you deferred objects
[06:02:35] <Cork> or rather one deferred object
[06:03:29] <Cork> FilipNortic_: it doesn't return js native Promise, so that might be a bit misleading
[06:06:01] <FilipNortic_> Cork: that was copied from the api page
[06:06:24] <Cork> FilipNortic_: i think that page has been updated for 3.0
[06:06:49] <Cork> where it returns a deferred that is 100% compatible with promise
[06:07:04] <FilipNortic_> hmm maybe we're not switching get so I'm not sure
[06:07:04] <Cork> (still isn't exactly a promise)
[06:07:08] <Justice> But from my understanding you can send an array of promises to $.when ? so using $.when(arr).done(function(result)) should give object with all returns no?
[06:07:17] <Cork> FilipNortic_: it still is a deferred so...
[06:07:29] <Cork> Justice: no
[06:07:38] <Cork> $.when.apply(arr)
[06:07:53] <Cork> opps $.when.apply(null, arr)
[06:08:11] <Cork> Justice: $.when expects arguments to be one deferred each
[06:08:24] <Cork> not an array of deferres
[06:09:43] <FilipNortic_> never had an array of deferres...
[06:09:53] <FilipNortic_> sounds a bit wired
[06:10:27] <Justice> Cork: whats the null? cannot seem to find anything about apply on jquery docs.
[06:10:47] <Cork> FilipNortic_: ex var requests = []; each(function() { requests.push($.ajax()) }); $.when.apply(null, requests);
[06:11:09] <Cork> Justice: apply is a javascript native function
[06:11:20] <Cork> Justice: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[06:11:39] <FilipNortic_> and kinf of an inportant one if you wanna know what's going on in js code
[06:11:42] <Cork> Justice: null is what value should be the this in the function call
[06:11:48] <Cork> ya
[06:12:13] <Cork> Justice: and as $.when doesn't use this, just set it to anything (null in this case)
[06:12:26] <Justice> I see =)
[06:12:29] <Cork> window, or document, or undefined would work just as well
[06:12:42] <Cork> or 1,2,3,4,0 or ... any thning :
[06:12:46] <Cork> *thing
[06:13:57] <Justice> Hm im getting something now but result only contains 1 response,.
[06:14:26] <Cork> Justice: what you should get is an array of responses
[06:15:00] <Cork> ex. $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax(),$.ajax(),$.ajax(),$.ajax()).done(function(data) { data[0] == first ajax response }
[06:15:34] <Cork> and data[1] is the second and so on
[06:18:31] <Justice> Cork: got this atm; http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/23084677/
[06:18:37] <Justice> arr is the requsts
[06:19:02] <Cork> Justice: you don't need .promise() from $.ajax
[06:19:09] <Cork> just use $.ajax() directly
[06:20:51] <Cork> Justice: btw you can use $.when.arra(null, $.map($(keywords), function(elm) { return backend(keywork); }))
[06:25:16] <Justice> um bit
[06:26:58] <Justice> does this mean that the backend will run for each value in keywords or?
[06:27:27] <codecutter> what will be the 'replaceWith' alternative to this statement? $(value).appendTo($('.foo'))
[06:28:41] <codecutter> e.g. replace all childs of $('.foo') with value
[06:33:14] <codecutter> nvm
[06:35:32] <Justice> hm using $.map keeps getting me b is not a function. Odd anyhow i need some food for my brain brb =)
[07:19:55] <chipyy> if( name.length<2) {alert ("error")} that should work right?
[07:21:54] <chipyy> or if ($("#name").length<2) that should also work ?
[07:26:05] <yaeykay> Please help, not incrementing the counter inside my htmlTemplate array http://laravel.io/bin/bE98a
[07:27:15] <tinyhippo> if I have a load of table rows, and I $.each over each row and do an ajax call, it blocks other events until they stop doing their ajax calls, how can I prevent that?
[08:01:16] <MacroMan_> tinyhippo, That's not the default behaviour. Paste your code
[08:07:39] <tinyhippo> MacroMan_: http://p.tinyhip.pw/view/13b2e7f0
[08:07:58] <tinyhippo> I can't do the on('click') until the .each at the top has finished.
[08:17:40] <Duikb00t> Cork:  you still aroudn here/ :D
[08:18:13] <Cork> Duikb00t: just ask the question if you have one
[08:19:00] <Duikb00t> I have a Twitter Bootstrap accordion, issue: When I open a accordion tab, I want to have below that panel a container fluid with a container.
[08:19:08] <Duikb00t> day2 of being stuck at that has started :P
[08:19:15] <Duikb00t> Do you have any ideas how I can accomplish that?
[08:20:12] <Cork> Duikb00t: i don't use bootstrap much, so i would need a jsfiddle to tell what you are trying to do
[08:20:17] <Duikb00t> setting one up
[08:20:36] <Duikb00t> oh nice channel logged
[08:26:16] <Duikb00t> forget the JS for a second
[08:26:17] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/6/
[08:26:36] <Duikb00t> You see the divider div? I would like that one to be in that place but, container-fluid should take the full width
[08:26:43] <Duikb00t> Totaly stuck
[08:28:01] <Duikb00t> Also when I 'collapse' it so only the title is visible, then it shouldn't be visiblie anymore. (that's possible with JS ) but that container issue.. I have no idea how to do that because 1) I'll break the whole dom structure i think?
[08:28:03] <Cork> so you want the accordion to not have a margin?
[08:28:11] <Duikb00t> The accordion is perfect
[08:28:17] <Duikb00t> the divider div sshould be full width
[08:28:30] <Cork> what divider?
[08:28:31] <MacroMan_> tinyhippo, I can't see any obvious problems. The ajax should be asyncronous, so the click should still register.
[08:29:15] <Duikb00t> <div id="divider">
[08:29:23] <Duikb00t> It's all about that piece of content.
[08:29:26] <Cork> tinyhippo, MacroMan_: javascript is single threaded only one thing can run at a time
[08:30:18] <Duikb00t> this is almost what I want https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/7/
[08:30:24] <Cork> Duikb00t: so you want the fluid div to go outside the parent div, is that what you're asking for?
[08:30:25] <Duikb00t> But then my accordeon seems to be broken
[08:30:28] <Duikb00t> yes
[08:31:00] <Cork> you won't be able to do that without restructuring it quite a lot
[08:31:07] <Cork> accordion depends on overflow: hidden
[08:31:14] <Cork> and that will prevent what you want to do
[08:31:22] <Duikb00t> tried that already indeed
[08:32:19] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/8/ makes more sense
[08:34:24] <Cork> Duikb00t: you can't have that element inside the accordion if you want the effect you're looking for
[08:34:36] <Duikb00t> Hmm
[08:34:51] <Duikb00t> So I should setup divs outside it an append them to it when visible?
[08:35:05] <Duikb00t> But ... then again I have the same issue?
[08:35:29] <Cork> not sure what it is you're trying to do, fully
[08:35:41] <Duikb00t> Can I send you a screen in a PM?
[08:36:01] <wish^> Anyone know of a good way to get all elements of a certain type and then put each of the data attributes they have into an array?
[08:36:22] <JZA> hi I want to get a on click behavior to get some areas filled with blue.
[08:36:40] <JZA> I tried addClass() and css() but can't get it to work
[08:36:42] <JZA> https://jsfiddle.net/n210633k/
[08:37:25] <Cork> Duikb00t: i was a bit quick to judge i see, what about https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/9/ ?
[08:38:07] <Cork> JZA: svg is a separate document so you can't bind the click handler like that
[08:38:16] <JZA> is inline
[08:38:23] <Cork> doesn't matter
[08:38:33] <JZA> plus I kinda alredy did it.
[08:38:52] <JZA> just 'click' is the behavior that is not really working
[08:39:09] <Viddax> Is there any jQuery plugin to allow to edit the fields on a td row? Eg: I click on Edit button and text will render to input tag
[08:39:14] <Viddax> I can't seem to find it.
[08:39:35] <JZA> I applied a removeClass(); on certain values
[08:39:45] <Duikb00t> Cork:  if there is a way to make that div now 100% widht it's extaclty what Im looking for
[08:39:52] <JZA> just not able to get on('click'...
[08:40:08] <Duikb00t> I have send you a screenshot in pmsg
[08:43:14] <JZA> Cork: https://codepen.io/dandrademx/pen/JKzkkq
[08:43:26] <JZA> this is filling the checkbox from a click event
[08:43:39] <JZA> what I need is to also switch the fill color on the graphic
[08:44:16] <Cork> JZA: the problem is svg is a different doctype
[08:44:24] <Cork> it isn't html
[08:44:37] <JZA> so how can I get the event to work here.
[08:44:39] <Cork> this causes events problem as they don't populate cross document types
[08:44:53] <Cork> you have to search into that document and bind the handler there
[08:45:07] <Cork> (and yes it is a messy pain)
[08:45:10] <Viddax> Is there any jQuery plugin to allow to edit the fields on a td row? Eg: I click on Edit button and text will render to input tags.
[08:48:18] <heizenberg> Hi guys please help. jQuery select change event not firing on a newly added select http://laravel.io/bin/roEPY
[08:49:35] <Cork> heizenberg: use delegated event handlers
[08:49:48] <Cork> heizenberg: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:50:34] <JZA> Cork: this example works. http://jsfiddle.net/P6t2B/
[08:52:17] <Duikb00t> Your example was perfect Cork if it was full-width :D
[08:52:44] <Cork> Duikb00t: what do you mean?
[08:57:45] <heizenberg> @Cork in the addOrders.click Section?
[08:59:28] <Duikb00t> You example
[08:59:44] <Duikb00t> Was this: https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/9/
[09:00:10] <Duikb00t> If there was a way to get that container fluid like the red one: https://jsfiddle.net/mum6nquh/10/ then it's exactly what I need. :-)
[09:03:03] <heizenberg> @Cork you still there?
[09:07:53] <Hollusionist> how can i differenciate between $() and $('.some-class-that-exists-in-dom')
[09:10:43] <heizenberg> Guys really need help here please?
[09:22:54] <jomofcw> In a click event, is there a way to check if the target element of the event is the holder of this one ?
[09:24:29] <FilipNortic_> if you pass the event variable to the function there is event.target i don't know if that's what you want though
[09:27:00] <jomofcw> FilipNortic i'll give it a look, thanks ^^.
[09:33:18] <heizenberg> Need help newly added select not firing on change event http://laravel.io/bin/9voxR#83-85
[09:37:23] <FilipNortic_> heizenberg: your missing an argument in your handle
[09:37:35] <FilipNortic_> which elments to look for change in
[09:38:04] <heizenberg> @FilipNortic_ Thanks you. But what argument?
[09:38:18] <wish^> heizenberg, if you are dynamically creating elements you need to attach the handler to the parent element of the dom like http://paste.ubuntu.com/23085088/
[09:38:38] <FilipNortic_> the defered one.. maybe i missread the earlier converstion
[09:39:16] <heizenberg> Thanks for helping guys, Sorry for noob questions i'm newbie
[09:40:14] <heizenberg> @wish^ my parent element is #orderLine Right?
[09:40:28] <FilipNortic_> heizenberg: the element your binding too must be present when the on statment is run
[09:41:07] <FilipNortic_> so but a conole.log($("#elementBingingto")) above the click function and check that it's there
[09:41:16] <FilipNortic_> put*
[09:42:28] <wish^> heizenberg, go to your html and bind the handler to parent of the element you are creating so http://paste.ubuntu.com/23085098/
[09:42:29] <heizenberg> @FilipNortic_ can you please give me an example by forking my pastebin?
[09:43:48] <FilipNortic_> that was just a bit of extra info what wish^ shows will work

[09:50:27] <m_fulder> Hello! I have a weird bug I can not solve. I have a jquery selector for an <a> tag inside a div like $(.div-class a). It reloads this div with a bit different data but with the same class and <a> tags insode. After the reload the selector doesn't work anymore which is really weird cause the same div exists after content reloading. Any ideas what could be wrong?
[09:53:31] <FilipNortic_> m_fulder: have you tried just the $('.div-class') selector
[09:54:00] <ul71m0> i have a plugin that is creating one element on page using js, i needed to write my own jquery to alter that element, but when resizing to resolution smaller than 768px that main plugin recreates that element and my alterations are not applied, how can i be sure that my changes are applied when this element gets recreated
[09:55:07] <m_fulder> FilipNortic_: I have tried only $('a') selector because I am calling the .click function for the found elements. But it doens't work either.
[09:57:20] <FilipNortic_> well it really sound like you're breaking something then but we have really no way of checking that.
[09:57:31] <FilipNortic_> m_fulder: you have checked the log for errors right?
[09:58:10] <m_fulder> FilipNortic_: it seems like my ajax script isn't loaded somehow after the first jquery is called. Yes I have checked errors and everything runs as intended.
[10:14:48] <Justice> im back, got it working after some stackoverflow googling :P
[10:15:19] <Justice> though I got a question when doning JSON.stringify on my promises it returns empty object array.
[10:15:49] <Justice> things work but feels odd that the promise array shows empty objects.
[10:24:12] <z1haze_work> I have a problem where only in IE the page seems not to recognize when a mouse is hovering a carousel arrow.. the css :hover doesnt apply and you cant click them. any ideas? (only ie)
[10:26:46] <m_fulder> FilipNortic_: I've made a fiddle out of my case and it still is the same bug. Maybe Im doing something really wrong with jquery: https://jsfiddle.net/68zLkqzw/  but why doesn't the jquery selector work on the second link (second click)?
[10:28:49] <shoky> m_fulder: because it doesn't exist yet at the time you added the event handler. you'd need to either add it after the element exists, or use event delegation, e.g.  $(document).on('click', 'a', function(event) { ... })   see docs for .on() for more info
[10:29:26] <z1haze_work> if you replace the html of the link itself though it will work
[10:29:37] <shoky> there's also  https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:30:59] <heizenberg> @wish^ I added a on change in #subTotal1 but not firing? http://laravel.io/bin/De5Wy#87-89
[10:31:34] <m_fulder> z1haze_work: I do need to change all the content not only the link but shoky's solution works just fine with $(document).on('click'...
[10:31:50] <z1haze_work> yep
[10:31:58] <z1haze_work> dont think you need document though
[10:32:06] <z1haze_work> can probably be a little more specific
[10:32:39] <z1haze_work> maybe your .inner_div class will suffice
[10:32:47] <m_fulder> aha right, and thanks for the link shoky I understand the difference between simple click and the on('click') better
[10:32:51] <z1haze_work> im sorry, .container
[10:33:19] <m_fulder> z1haze_work: yeah it works fine with .container too :)
[10:33:21] <shoky> m_fulder:  .click(function..) is exactly the same as  .on('click', function..)
[10:33:36] <shoky> m_fulder: the different one  is .on('click', 'selector-here', function..)
[10:33:40] <FilipNortic_> m_fulder: if you said that the problem was that you're event we're not firing you would have gotten a better answer
[10:34:16] <m_fulder> FilipNortic_: yeah sorry for that
[10:34:40] <m_fulder> shoky: oh I see!
[10:35:00] <shoky> you should really read the link i posted ;p
[10:36:49] <m_fulder> shoky: yeah I am reading :)
[10:44:08] <m_fulder> shoky: I just thought before that every jquery selector would work or any items new/old. Have read through and understood your link much better now and my code finally works. Thanks a lot :)
[10:45:49] <shoky> ;]

[11:48:39] <Pablo__> Hi. I have a div inside a column in bootstrap, and I would like that block (in red in the image) to follow the scrolling but only inside that column: http://imgur.com/M7imUKT
[11:48:53] <Pablo__> Thanks in advance.
[12:09:45] <Pablo__> I have a page with a header, a footer, a content area and a column. I want to make a block inside the column that follows the scroll but only inside the column lenght. I've made a diagram in order to explain myself better: http://imgur.com/a/5bT5w
[12:10:06] <Pablo__> I've anyone need clarifications (english is not my first language), please ask :)
[12:10:28] <Pablo__> The diagram intends to show how it should look after scrolling
[12:10:54] <robertmaxrees> are you asking a css question?
[12:11:45] <Pablo__> robertmaxrees, this can be done with CSS? Because I tried and it only takes the reference the top of the page
[12:11:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what you're asking.
[12:12:05] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm seeking clarification
[12:12:22] <Pablo__> Ok, I'll explain myself better, 1 sec :)
[12:12:26] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[12:13:00] <robertmaxrees> so you have an element that you want to follow the scroll of an area, but you want it to be constrained?
[12:14:04] <Pablo__> This is the webpage I'm working on: http://dev.panther.es/portatiles/spitfire.html. I want the 'Tu configuración' div to follow when I scroll down, returning to its upper limit when I scroll up again.
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/ could use something like this; http://leafo.net/sticky-kit/
[12:16:40] <Pablo__> robertmaxrees, it looks good :D
[12:16:55] <Pablo__> I'm going to give it a try, but I think this will do it
[12:17:13] <Pablo__> Thanks robertmaxrees despite my deficient explanations :P
[12:17:21] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[12:18:31] <islalobo> We have a for loop inside a for loop inside a for loop and we're facing and we are trying to create an array. The issue is that the last looped value is the only value that is applied for each object in the array
[12:18:56] <JZA> I am trying to do a conditional that sums all the values of an object and if they are all false, it should perform something.
[12:19:01] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you're trying to do, islalobo
[12:19:06] <JZA> how do I write "the sum of all values"
[12:21:31] <islalobo> https://jsfiddle.net/ygk8sg51/
[12:22:01] <robertmaxrees> JZA your question makes no sense.
[12:22:14] <islalobo> I have to update that fiddle to make it actually work, but that is the code
[12:22:26] <JZA> well yeah this makes more sense: Check if all values of array are equal to 'x'
[12:22:27] <robertmaxrees> JZA how do you add and get "false" as a result?
[12:22:41] <robertmaxrees> JZA Array.prototype.every
[12:22:45] <JZA> well iterate through the values and if something is not equal to x, then escape
[12:22:57] <robertmaxrees> use .every or .some
[12:23:02] <JZA> ok
[12:23:18] <robertmaxrees> .every(function(theThing) { return theThing.someProp; });
[12:24:04] <robertmaxrees> so islalobo what's the end result you're looking for here?
[12:26:11] <Pablo__> btw robertmaxrees, this worked like a charm. Thanks again :)
[12:26:19] <robertmaxrees> Pablo__ awesome.  glad to hear.
[12:27:13] <islalobo> We get a drug product object with a list of provinces that it is available in back from a web service. We are displaying a list of provinces with a checkbox with a value (checked or not checked based on the api). In the for loop we want to: set all the missing values for each drug product to false, meaning if there is no province value returned we set 'selected' (checked) to false and set the value for any returned values to true.
[12:27:26] <robertmaxrees> islalobo can you make an example of the data you're looking for?
[12:27:33] <robertmaxrees> of the end result, I mean.
[12:27:41] <islalobo> This works, except that we set the same value for all drug products — the last value
[12:29:26] <robertmaxrees> islalobo it sounds like you need a step to generate the data you want and then a step to work through the data to set things as you're expecting.
[12:30:18] <islalobo> The data we want we have as dummy data at the moment. Making that call is the easy part. The set to set things as we're expecting is the for loop(s) in the fiddle
[12:30:29] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want loops.
[12:30:34] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'm getting at.
[12:30:45] <islalobo> It's setting the data as we expect, except that only the last drug product province is set — set for all drug products
[12:30:56] <islalobo> We don't want loops?
[12:30:56] <robertmaxrees> lol you keep repeating that.
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> you want to use things like map, foreach, every, some, etc.
[12:31:20] <islalobo> Okay, I can give that a try :)
[12:31:22] <robertmaxrees> for loops are gross.  they leak scope.
[12:31:35] <robertmaxrees> plus map et al are much easier to read.
[12:31:53] <robertmaxrees> also: nesting iterators isn't usually what you want to do.
[12:32:10] <arc_> foreach is a loop :p i never even heard of every and some though
[12:32:34] <robertmaxrees> foreach is for iterating, but it's descriptive instead of prescriptive.
[12:32:57] <robertmaxrees> every, some, map, filter, reduce... all awesome tools.
[12:33:23] <arc_> wow, some is very useful
[12:33:43] <robertmaxrees> as is every.
[12:33:56] <robertmaxrees> how many times do you see people going through an array just to see if something matches a predicate?
[12:34:02] <robertmaxrees> or if everything matches a predicate?
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> map and filter replace all those cases where you're pushing stuff into another array.
[12:37:43] <phil22> hello
[12:48:42] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: we pass a function to some() ie, some(_callback_)
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure you don't want some in this case.
[12:48:58] <robertmaxrees> but yep.
[12:49:14] <robertmaxrees> some returns a boolean if at least one item in the array matches a predicate
[12:49:22] <islalobo> really? I read over map and filter and they don't seem to be what I want either
[12:49:33] <robertmaxrees> you want to convert one format to another, right?
[12:50:03] <islalobo> Sort of, I think that is one way to describe it
[12:50:11] <robertmaxrees> which is what .map() is for.
[12:50:28] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like of like you're trying to merge the contents of two arrays together.
[12:50:37] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to accomplish exactly that.
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> how far off am i?
[12:55:23] <islalobo> We want to know if the province.province_code exist in the drugProduct provinces array
[12:55:39] <islalobo> If it does, then set the data as we expect it
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, alright.
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably do somnething like https://jsfiddle.net/p7ymp2md/
[12:58:42] <islalobo> Does that sound much different
[12:58:46] <islalobo> Oops
[12:58:54] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't want array every/array some
[13:09:10] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: the only issue is that I'm checking array1 (provinces) against drugPructsProvinces(array) foreach drugProduct
[13:09:42] <hellyeah> yo
[13:09:49] <robertmaxrees> why is that a problem?
[13:09:59] <hellyeah> what is the problem?
[13:10:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:10:44] <arc_> where is the problem?
[13:10:51] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to compare data in two arrays and then set stuff on a page.
[13:11:13] <arc_> sorry i was just asking the next W, i wasn't really asking
[13:11:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:11:33] <hellyeah> compare two arrays for equality?
[13:11:37] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:11:46] <robertmaxrees> i've already shown him how to do it fwiw.]
[13:12:04] <hellyeah> you can show it to me also :D
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:14:59] <islalobo> Should I put the return into a foreach? To get at the the second array's provinces?
[13:15:59] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:16:06] <robertmaxrees> foreach is just for iterating - it doesn't make a new array.
[13:17:53] <islalobo> I just want to iterate to get at the array of provicnes foreach drugProduct
[13:18:06] <islalobo> Would you say that .each is "a for loop for lazy people"??
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> you want to generate the array you want first.
[13:21:21] <robertmaxrees> then forEach over that to set things.
[13:21:39] <islalobo> https://jsfiddle.net/z6mfe6gp/ (this won't work, just updated data)
[13:22:40] <islalobo> But I want to do that for each drug product
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you have basically have a multiple filter thing going on.
[13:27:07] <robertmaxrees> or a .some() against the provinces array for each drug
[13:36:48] <robertmaxrees> islalobo https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z6mfe6gp/6/
[13:36:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd abstract that out.
[14:09:04] <int-main> How do I detect change in URL using jQuery. I tried $(window).on("popstate", function(){}}); but it doesn't work
[14:09:12] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> need to use native js for that.
[14:12:15] <solidpizza> hello, I am wondering if it's possible to set an event handler for an element you just created. actually the element's child. I created it like this var Dialog = $('<div><input type=text></div>'); I want to put an event on that input
[14:12:27] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener instead.
[14:12:32] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event'
[14:12:42] <robertmaxrees> woops - $(parent).on('event', 'child'
[14:12:43] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[14:16:22] <solidpizza> robertmaxrees: like this? Dialog.on('change', 'select', function () {})
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:19:33] <solidpizza> hm... the callback is not getting called
[14:19:42] <robertmaxrees> does the dialog exist on pageload?
[14:20:31] <solidpizza> no. it's created in memory in the variable inside of a click event
[14:21:31] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.  you need to bind to a parent that does exist on pageload.
[14:24:59] <solidpizza> oh ok I just put it on the document and it calls now
[14:25:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd bind it as low as you can, but yeah that'll work.
[14:33:23] <rjCousineau> Hi. I cannot seem to get momentJS working and was wondering how am I messing this up?  I'm copying exactly from a working example and this time i keep getting .format() is not a function  https://dpaste.de/6hgr
[14:34:35] <robertmaxrees> try console.log(typeof moment.duration(rawTime, "minutes"));
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:35:19] <robertmaxrees> ah, durations aren't basic moment objects.  what's why.
[14:37:21] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: object
[14:37:51] <rjCousineau> what does that mean
[14:39:01] <rjCousineau> documents state: creating a duration is moment.duration(Number)
[14:40:13] <rjCousineau> .humanize() works
[14:45:05] <rjCousineau> :(
[15:16:48] <wish^> Does .find(element) always return the first element?
[15:18:52] <shoky> wish^: it returns all elements it finds
[15:35:43] <wish^> shoky, but does it have an order?
[15:38:05] <shoky> wish^: the order they have in the document i guess.. earlier siblings come before later siblings.. parents come before children
[15:38:52] <wish^> Ok
[16:01:48] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[16:13:07] <andywww> how does one maintain state in an object which is read in once on page load then continually modified through events on the interface?
[16:13:32] <robertmaxrees> context?
[16:14:14] <andywww> I’m reading in a geojson file and then allowing users to modify the elements in that object using a leaflet map api interface
[16:14:38] <andywww> i need the json to sit sort of suspended in memory so i can work on it
[16:14:52] <robertmaxrees> just need to make it available in a shared scope.
[16:15:18] <andywww> so crudely, window.what_i’m_working_on = {}
[16:15:18] <andywww> ?
[16:15:34] <andywww> then just refer to it directly?
[16:15:35] <robertmaxrees> that's one way.  otherwise, there are things like backbone views/models that can hold that kind of state for you.
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> just kind of depends.
[16:16:36] <andywww> pfff, i’m trying to avoid using a framework if at all possible
[16:16:42] <andywww> but its looking like it might have to be
[16:19:38] <andywww> its surprisingly code intensive trying to modify a json object using just javascript
[16:19:56] <andywww> they don’t traverse well, do they
[16:22:30] <robertmaxrees> what don't?
[16:22:33] <robertmaxrees> objects?
[16:22:36] <andywww> yeah
[16:22:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what you mean by "they don't traverse well"
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> i mean, modifying objects isn't really that hard unless you have somethng like super complex.
[16:25:11] <robertmaxrees> in which case i always suggest doing an initial transform to get a simplified version of what you want to represent the state in the browser (which is what it sounds like you need)
[16:25:30] <andywww> well, if you had an object that had an array of objects, say:
[16:26:13] <andywww> its fairly normal to want to say go to like, i don’t know, mainObject.array_of_widgets
[16:26:19] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:26:28] <andywww> then be able to say select the widget out of that array that meets a ertain criteria
[16:26:33] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[16:28:28] <andywww> one sec let me visualise my problem
[16:28:35] <robertmaxrees> so you have something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kopgzgtj/
[16:28:58] <robertmaxrees> overly simplified right?
[16:29:36] <andywww> wait a sec let me cook up a real world example
[16:29:42] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:29:47] <andywww> appreciate the patience btw
[16:29:58] <robertmaxrees> definitely.  something tells me you just need some guidance :)
[16:31:00] <Darmani> Hi everyone, quick question.
[16:31:03] <Darmani> For some reason one of the classes I add to my page doesn't appear until I refresh the page.
[16:31:08] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/68d77e95f93cecb962807ae6978fc5ea#file-projects-js
[16:31:15] <Darmani> Am I doing it wrong?
[16:31:52] <robertmaxrees> Darmani have you made sure thge event handler is even working?
[16:32:13] <robertmaxrees> also: you're missing var statements on some of those.
[16:32:20] <TimCoal> andywww i'm just writing some code to parse a big JS object and find it just as easy as arrays
[16:32:55] <robertmaxrees> arrays are stupid simple.  plus they have a ton of great methods that you don't get with objects.
[16:33:01] <robertmaxrees> unless you get into iterators.
[16:34:41] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/adf1bca2a272176365c081e2c99f1a1e?short_path=ce973dd
[16:34:59] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: How do I check that?
[16:35:10] <robertmaxrees> Darmani could use a console log.
[16:35:22] <robertmaxrees> andywww cool - so where are you getting stuck?
[16:35:35] <andywww> how would i, on this one for instance, say “change the latitude of the point with the ID of 3 to be 11.093833”
[16:36:10] <andywww> or, “remove the point with the ID of 2 and renumber the other point IDs”
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> while actually modifying the original data?
[16:36:29] <phil22> hello
[16:36:38] <andywww> yes cos i’d want to post this back as a modification to the route
[16:36:50] <phil22> how many event listeners does $(selector).click() uses?
[16:37:04] <robertmaxrees> phil22 however many elements you target with the selector.
[16:37:04] <phil22> the number of elements found with the selector?
[16:37:06] <phil22> ok
[16:37:41] <robertmaxrees> andywww so if you really need to mutate the original data (and i'd rethink that strategy if possible), i'd foreach all over this.
[16:38:15] <andywww> i can see how you’d simply bind the result of the original json that came with the get request to a variable on window, but working on the object in memory seems a bit exhausting
[16:38:23] <andywww> yeah
[16:38:33] <robertmaxrees> where else are you going to work on the object?
[16:38:41] <robertmaxrees> also: those IDs are completely useless if you'd need to reorder them :)
[16:38:53] <robertmaxrees> they're just indexes offset by 1.
[16:39:26] <andywww> well, the other option is to somehow emulate the object in memory and then have something that builds the geojson from whatever I’m bastardising at the point of postig
[16:40:05] <robertmaxrees> you could just post back modifications to it instead of the whole object.  or just post changes as they happen.
[16:40:11] <robertmaxrees> expose a cleaner api and all that.
[16:40:37] <andywww> i never thought i’d say this but i miss sql
[16:40:50] <robertmaxrees> because it's better suited for jobs like this :)
[16:40:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hLpn23hy/ this is one approach.
[16:41:21] <robertmaxrees> or look into underscore/lodash for prepackaged util methods.
[16:43:09] <robertmaxrees> this is where libraries like backbone come in handy.
[16:43:12] <andywww> it’d not be too much work to abstract it out into some chainable functions would it.
[16:43:20] <robertmaxrees> you could if you wanted.
[16:43:39] <andywww> getNodeById(4).updateLatitude(“11.009898”)
[16:43:39] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Okay so I have the div's hidden by default. I try to add an .active class to my first one and it still doesn't work. what gives?
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> Darmani make a fiddle?
[16:43:47] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/68d77e95f93cecb962807ae6978fc5ea#file-projects-js
[16:43:56] <robertmaxrees> Darmani yeah, make a jsfiddle yo.
[16:44:07] <NaN> hi there
[16:44:28] <robertmaxrees> Darmani fwiw i don't see any html or anything with that ID on the page.
[16:44:40] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: This is built on a preprocessor though... What should I put on a fiddle?
[16:44:49] <robertmaxrees> the rendered html.
[16:44:57] <robertmaxrees> and rendered css
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> those jsfiddle supports scss.
[16:45:12] <robertmaxrees> *though
[16:46:31] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I'm also using objects from a back-end... It would be hard to show all of it from a fiddle.
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> Darmani i would want a simplified test case of just your front-end.
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> not your entire page.
[16:46:58] <robertmaxrees> because from what i'm seeing, that ID doesn't exist.
[16:47:09] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I updated the rendered html. It's there.
[16:47:11] <Darmani> trust me.
[16:47:15] <robertmaxrees> and your js file is invalid.
[16:47:49] <Darmani> it is? o.o
[16:47:57] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/68d77e95f93cecb962807ae6978fc5ea#file-projects-js
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:48:16] <robertmaxrees> missing a closign curly.
[16:48:16] <Darmani> What's wrong with it?
[16:48:27] <Darmani> oh shit
[16:48:28] <Darmani> it is.
[16:48:52] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wkywtqxq/
[16:48:57] <robertmaxrees> this is all you really need for a test case.
[16:49:30] <Darmani> oh wow. yeah I guess you're right.
[16:49:54] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't read any of your backend or anything. it only speaks DOM.
[16:50:41] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: hmm. Let me edit it a little more to reflect what I have.
[16:51:13] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:53:26] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/wkywtqxq/1/
[16:53:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wkywtqxq/2/
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> your problem is the cascade
[16:54:06] <robertmaxrees> rule weight and stuff.
[16:54:53] <Darmani> oh. What's that rule exactly?
[16:55:05] <robertmaxrees> have one element with two classes, right?]
[16:55:12] <robertmaxrees> projectexample and active
[16:55:17] <robertmaxrees> both set the display property
[16:55:23] <robertmaxrees> which one should win out?
[16:55:36] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: the one you add to it?
[16:55:49] <robertmaxrees> DOM has no concept of taht.
[16:55:54] <robertmaxrees> *that - doesn't track that kind of stuff.
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> it's whichever one comes last.
[16:56:25] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I didn't know that :o
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> OR whichever one has more "weight" according to the selector.
[16:56:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wkywtqxq/3/
[16:56:46] <robertmaxrees> here's another example.
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> flipped them back but added another class to that sucker.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> since you're using scss though, just do this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wkywtqxq/4/
[16:57:55] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: are you a wizard?
[16:58:01] <robertmaxrees> lol nope.
[16:58:06] <robertmaxrees> I just know some css.
[16:58:13] <taplar> he does live close to the coast though
[16:58:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:58:26] <robertmaxrees> it still takes forever to get there :(
[16:59:19] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: But it still only loads after I refresh the page. When I first visit it, it doesn't have the .active class o.o
[16:59:28] <robertmaxrees> how are yopu verifying it?
[16:59:33] <robertmaxrees> are you inspectinging or...?
[16:59:39] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: yep
[16:59:49] <robertmaxrees> then you're not targeting things correctly.
[16:59:55] <robertmaxrees> are you, like, repeating IDs or something?
[17:00:24] <Darmani> no the ID's are unique... hmm hang on.
[17:00:48] <robertmaxrees> you can always console.log($('#selectorHere').length);
[17:00:52] <robertmaxrees> if you're getting 0...
[17:01:07] <taplar> [id="..."] to check for multiples
[17:01:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah,  console.log($('[id="selectorHere"]').length); if that's > 1, something is busted.
[17:02:24] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Well the ID's are unique to each object. They can't be repeated.
[17:02:33] <robertmaxrees> triple check.
[17:02:40] * Darmani sighs
[17:02:41] <Darmani> ok
[17:02:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> quick and easy to pop that into your console
[17:03:02] <taplar> what's the quote?  trust but verify?
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> measure twice, cut once.
[17:03:28] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:03:44] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: yep. only shows up once. Also the rendered html tells no lies
[17:03:46] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/68d77e95f93cecb962807ae6978fc5ea#file-view-source
[17:03:55] <robertmaxrees> just something to check.
[17:04:04] <Darmani> yeah I get that.
[17:04:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing turbolinks in here.
[17:04:46] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're loading all css correctly?
[17:04:56] <robertmaxrees> really hard to figure this out without an example to work off of.
[17:05:08] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: lemme double check.
[17:05:36] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: without an example? Should I make another fiddle?
[17:06:06] <robertmaxrees> a functional jsfiddle that shows the problem would be ideal.
[17:07:43] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to compare the fiddle to what I have and they are almost identical. It has to be something on my end.
[17:08:24] <robertmaxrees> are you sure the js is even running?
[17:09:05] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Well it has to be. The project doesn't show up at first but if I refresh the page the class is added.
[17:09:24] <Darmani> oddly enough.
[17:09:25] <robertmaxrees> do you have a console log or breakpoint in there to verifyt?
[17:09:49] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Sorry I'm not the best with JQuery. What am I doing console.log on?
[17:10:07] <robertmaxrees> inside the function that should change the element.
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> like, verifying that code path actually runs in the first place.
[17:11:02] <Darmani> right, lemme check.
[17:11:24] <robertmaxrees> one of those like "always assume you did something really basic wrong:
[17:13:39] <Darmani> hang on still checking...
[17:15:30] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I don't see my console.log so I'm guessing I wrote it wrong.
[17:15:30] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/68d77e95f93cecb962807ae6978fc5ea#file-projects-js
[17:16:11] <robertmaxrees>  assets/projects.self-6fb73c0cf32ab2d194b56a9159ed57693a8f8743314b7b28b14a02f47f013348.js?body=1 - you sure your caching is working correctly?
[17:16:53] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: what are you looking at? o.o
[17:17:05] <robertmaxrees> your gist?
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/68d77e95f93cecb962807ae6978fc5ea#file-view-source
[17:17:29] <Darmani> oh
[17:17:43] <robertmaxrees> triple check your caching.
[17:17:49] <robertmaxrees> see if the file is even loading.
[17:17:51] <Darmani> how2checkthat.jpg
[17:17:58] <robertmaxrees> network tab.
[17:18:01] <robertmaxrees> look for the file.
[17:18:02] <robertmaxrees> click it.
[17:18:07] <robertmaxrees> look at the response.
[17:19:05] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Oh there it is!!
[17:19:07] <Darmani> I saw it.
[17:19:10] <Darmani> The console log worked.
[17:19:23] <robertmaxrees> okay/.
[17:22:28] <Darmani> ugggg
[17:22:36] <Darmani> I'm gonna keep working at this and stop bothering you
[17:22:44] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: but thanks for helping I actually learned a lot lol
[17:22:48] <robertmaxrees> are you still getting the console log?
[17:22:55] <Darmani> yeah.
[17:23:03] <robertmaxrees> wait doesn't turbolinks do things via ajax?
[17:23:22] <Darmani> I actually don't know too much about that. I probably should. Lol
[17:23:36] <robertmaxrees> so the js might be running bnefore the elements actually exist.
[17:24:20] <Darmani> maybe o.o
[17:24:58] <robertmaxrees> did you view source to get that rendered page?
[17:25:06] <robertmaxrees> or did you use the inspector to get it?
[17:25:09] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Turbolinks: With Turbolinks pages will change without a full reload, so you can't rely on DOMContentLoaded or jQuery.ready() to trigger your code. Instead Turbolinks fires events on document to provide hooks into the lifecycle of the page.
[17:25:23] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:25:35] <Darmani> What does that mean exactly.
[17:25:40] <Darmani> I can't use JQuery?
[17:25:45] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery
[17:25:51] <Darmani> yeah that
[17:25:52] <robertmaxrees> and it means you need to hook into the events it fires.
[17:26:33] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks#running-javascript-when-a-page-loads
[17:28:27] <Darmani> got it.
[17:28:33] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I owe you a beer or something dude.
[17:28:37] <Darmani> I gtg but i'll bbl
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:28:47] <Darmani> peace
[17:31:59] <taplar> it is correct that json can't include actual \n in it, right?
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> values can.
[17:32:17] <taplar> unencoded?
[17:32:18] <robertmaxrees> err, wait like a literal \n
[17:32:21] <robertmaxrees> or just a newline?
[17:32:27] <taplar> actual newlines
[17:32:39] <robertmaxrees> Whitespace can be inserted between any pair of tokens. Excepting a few encoding details, that completely describes the language.
[17:32:53] <robertmaxrees> newlines are whitespace.
[17:33:15] <taplar> so between a "" and actual unencoded new line is valid
[17:33:23] <robertmaxrees> invalid.
[17:33:33] <robertmaxrees> because the "" is a token pair.
[17:33:49] <taplar> yeah thought so.  just confirming
[17:33:55] <robertmaxrees> yea definitely.
[17:43:37] <taplar> think we're being bit by a swagger thing that people are thinking is a problem, but I don't think it's a problem, lol
[17:43:46] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:44:06] <taplar> swagger doesn't make your json valid, with encoding, it's expecting you to give it valid json
[17:44:15] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.,
[17:44:18] <robertmaxrees> it wants JSON.
[17:44:29] <taplar> yeah, so i get to argue tomorrow that nothing is wrong
[17:45:38] <taplar> little insight to my world, lol
[17:46:33] <robertmaxrees> D:
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> fsrs
[17:46:34] <shoky> can you say a sentence or two on what swagger is/for? i remember i didnt relaly understand too much when reading about it a bit. something about automatically publishing api's something something
[17:46:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:46:47] <taplar> swagger is for documenting api endpoints
[17:46:54] <shoky> oh just for documenting?
[17:46:56] <robertmaxrees> basically, autodiscover your endpoints and then give it a nifty UI so people can see it and play with it.
[17:47:06] <robertmaxrees> also lets you actually use the api.
[17:47:08] <taplar> it creates both documentation and functioning endpoints all together
[17:47:34] <shoky> hm oks. thanks
[17:47:56] <taplar> it's really handy to have so people can hit url/api and see what all you have available instead of having to ask you over and over
[17:48:12] <taplar> what you have, what it needs, what it returns, blah blah
[17:48:21] <taplar> :)
[17:48:22] <robertmaxrees> bingo
[17:48:22] <shoky> gotcha
[18:13:08] <TimCoal> i'm digging around in the dom and found this example that doesn't make sense http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_node_valtypename
[18:13:31] <TimCoal> the script is selecting the first child in the div which is a textnode,
[18:13:32] <robertmaxrees> heh, w3schools makes things confusing.
[18:14:15] <TimCoal> it says the none name is #text and then says the node value is div?
[18:14:36] <TimCoal> *node
[18:15:36] <robertmaxrees> the value of that node is the string "This is a div element."
[18:15:40] <TimCoal> no entiendo
[18:15:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/s0t6ymxy/
[18:17:44] <TimCoal> hm
[18:17:50] <robertmaxrees> make sense now?
[18:18:29] <TimCoal> not yet, but i'll figure it
[18:18:37] <robertmaxrees> look in the html box.
[18:18:41] <robertmaxrees> <div id="myDIV">This is the text it's talking about.</div>
[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> you're getting that div's first child, which is a textnode.  that textnode has the value "This is the text it's talking about".
[18:20:12] <TimCoal> yes w3schools making things confusing
[18:20:28] <robertmaxrees> that's part of why i tell people to not use it heh.
[18:21:34] <TimCoal> yea, its good for referance
[18:21:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree with that, but meh.
[18:23:00] <TimCoal> jQuery.com isn't much better :s
[18:23:04] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:23:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a great reference for jquery.
[18:23:16] <robertmaxrees> mdn is great for DOM, CSS, and HTML.
[18:23:29] <TimCoal> i disagree with that but
[18:23:35] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[18:23:39] <TimCoal> yes mdn is good
[18:23:50] <robertmaxrees> why would the official api docs for jquery be worse than anything else?
[18:23:54] <robertmaxrees> hell, what's better?
[18:24:07] <TimCoal> if it was good, i wouldn't have needed to come here
[18:24:42] <robertmaxrees> That's often just a sign of somebody either not checking out the learning center, not grokking somethng, or the problem is poorly understood.
[18:24:56] <TimCoal> amasingly M$ actually has some good jQ documentation
[18:25:11] <robertmaxrees> i'll agree discoverability of solutions can feel a little lacking, but most folks aren't going to actually read through the entire learning center or all the docs for .on()
[18:25:12] <TimCoal> no there are diffrent styles
[18:25:25] <TimCoal> you can't keep all the people happy all the time and shouldn't try
[18:25:26] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:25:30] <robertmaxrees> right...
[18:25:50] <TimCoal> like books, when i'm buying a book on somethng, i read a few pages to make sure they make sense to me
[18:26:07] <robertmaxrees> none of this would be an indicator that the jq api docs are poor though >.>
[18:26:11] <TimCoal> it might be a great book but if i don't get it its useless
[18:26:20] <robertmaxrees> *to you :)
[18:28:03] <TimCoal> yes its a personal thing, thats why disagreeing is fairly pointless
[18:28:21] <TimCoal> unless you have a point
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:31:51] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:32:11] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what I was saying ;) it's all good.
[18:32:50] <TimCoal> sorry i philosophise a lot
[18:33:01] <TimCoal> yea all good
[18:33:17] <robertmaxrees> you also make some generic statements.
[18:33:55] <TimCoal> i'm a buddhist-punk its gonna happen
[18:34:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, you read brad warner as well ;)
[18:34:52] <TimCoal> no, don't read for pleasure
[18:35:07] <TimCoal> just for learning
[18:35:14] <TimCoal> i'm a little dipleptic
[18:35:48] <robertmaxrees> dialectic you mean?
[18:36:03] <TimCoal> i spent so long working with logic that i realised reality isn't logical
[18:36:06] <TimCoal> dyslexic
[18:36:13] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:36:35] <TimCoal> or more specifically nothing in it is binary
[18:36:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:37:42] <TimCoal> reality is in a logical state excluded by aristotal 2500+ years ago the middle state of true and false or yin yang
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:37:53] <robertmaxrees> soooo what kinds of projects you workin' on?
[18:38:11] <TimCoal> business app platform
[18:38:14] <robertmaxrees> cool
[18:39:26] <TimCoal> yea i used to mainly do IT support, but realised software is broken
[18:39:38] <robertmaxrees> your software is broken ooor?
[18:40:22] <TimCoal> no classic software is broken, because it is fixed
[18:40:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:40:31] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:40:51] <TimCoal> as soon as you finish something reality will soon break it
[18:41:00] <robertmaxrees> you remind me of my brother in law.
[18:41:25] <TimCoal> its just entropy
[18:41:35] <robertmaxrees> have fun.
[18:41:58] <TimCoal> the universe is in a state of going from order to disorder, so thngs get more complicated
[18:44:19] <TimCoal> what does your brother in law do?
[18:44:39] <robertmaxrees> not tech support?
[18:45:20] <TimCoal> answer or question?
[18:45:25] <robertmaxrees> answer.
[18:45:33] <robertmaxrees> (i'm not sure what he's up to these days)
[18:45:50] <TimCoal> k
[18:45:59] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:49:34] <TimCoal> sometimes its good to know pwoplw likw yourself, interesting things can happen
[18:49:34] <TimCoal> i'm not just a programmer
[18:50:23] <chipyy> Hey people , one quick question, its html and php :) <button onClick="logoff.php"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-off" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
[18:50:38] <robertmaxrees> chipyy ask in ##php then?
[18:50:44] <robertmaxrees> TimCoal lol nobody is just one thing mang.
[18:50:46] <chipyy> why it doesnt opens me php.file?
[18:50:56] <robertmaxrees> chipyy because onclick is for javascript.
[18:50:59] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't run php.
[18:51:09] <chipyy> omg i am stupid
[18:51:28] <chipyy> i am already mixing program languages between..
[18:51:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:51:47] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang.
[18:54:05] <chipyy> what do you think should i use a href for log off or function on click?
[18:54:23] <robertmaxrees> "log off or function"?
[18:54:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean to a php file?
[18:54:46] <chipyy> yes to call php file so it will destroy session etc.
[18:54:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##php
[18:55:03] <chipyy> with <a> or just on click with jquery to call it and run it
[18:55:05] <robertmaxrees> they'd have a better idea what kind of conventions they practice.
[18:55:26] <TimCoal> many people aren't even one thing
[18:55:48] <robertmaxrees> TimCoal correct.  can we get relatively back on topic now? :)_
[18:55:53] <TimCoal> i'd do on click with a ajax call
[18:55:59] <robertmaxrees> chippy generally, your api would be something like /account/logout though
[18:56:10] <robertmaxrees> you could ajax that but there's really no reason to.
[18:56:16] <TimCoal> personal preferance
[18:56:35] <robertmaxrees> unless you're managing state in your frontend and can replace all the "yay you're logged in" bits with the generic versions.
[18:56:42] <robertmaxrees> falls apart real quick when it gets to account pages and whatnot though.
[18:56:47] <TimCoal> i'm a one-page freak
[18:57:14] <robertmaxrees> which is fine - not really the case to this guy, who's starting with the basics :)
[18:57:31] <TimCoal> yea both achieve the objective
[18:57:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:59:15] <TimCoal> yea nice simple http get to a script
[18:59:32] <robertmaxrees> except that you then need to build all the other stuff to handle what "logging out" means.
[18:59:44] <robertmaxrees> which in this particular case is probably overkill.
[19:00:25] <TimCoal> early experiance of ajax isnt the worst thing that can happen
[19:00:53] <TimCoal> its not 1999 anymore
[19:01:02] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[19:01:07] <chipyy> i just did it on a href
[19:01:16] <chipyy> because its no need for one site :)
[19:01:19] <TimCoal> great :)
[19:02:01] <chipyy> and i have around 1 month and 5 days till my deadline
[19:02:19] <chipyy> for master degree or how you call that :D
[19:02:48] <chipyy> and i must also write around 90000 characters...
[19:03:04] <chipyy> anyway it doesnt matter :D
[19:03:06] <TimCoal> ahh its an assignment
[19:03:24] <chipyy> i picked it for myself and i hope that i made some money or millions from that :D
[19:03:48] <TimCoal> its been known
[19:03:49] <TimCoal> whats your idea?
[19:04:08] <chipyy> wont tell :D
[19:04:14] <TimCoal> good
[19:04:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:04:23] <robertmaxrees> nobody's going to steal your idea fwiw.
[19:04:37] <chipyy> now i am messing with some cookies, robertmaxrees u never know :D
[19:04:52] <robertmaxrees> sure i do :)
[19:05:32] <chipyy> why unset cookies doesnt destroy it?
[19:05:52] <chipyy> i think i found issue
[19:06:48] <robertmaxrees> why doesn't it log the user out you mean?
[19:07:43] <chipyy> yes on my index i have: if isset cookie username
[19:07:57] <chipyy> but in logoff.php i wrote unset cookie username
[19:08:07] <robertmaxrees> you need to ask in ##php.
[19:08:15] <robertmaxrees> since that's a php question and not a jquery question,
[19:09:03] <chipyy> jep :)
[19:10:29] <chipyy> but i bet thats again some stupid small mistake...
[19:10:37] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:10:46] <robertmaxrees> go ahead and ask in a php channel and they can help you further.
[19:11:06] <chipyy> because session is still set, because on my index its written that its still logged in
[19:12:37] <MarkX> anyone know if the navigation plugin for flot is able to automatically pan as new data gets added to the plot?
[19:13:48] <robertmaxrees> for flot?
[19:13:52] <robertmaxrees> have a link to some docs?
[19:13:56] <MarkX> robertmaxrees, one sec
[19:14:04] <MarkX> http://www.flotcharts.org/flot/jquery.flot.navigate.js
[19:14:17] <MarkX> also https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/API.md
[19:16:25] <MarkX> i wanted an oscilloscope kind of plot where it shows the latest data but allows you to pan to see older data as well
[19:17:13] <taplar> like google stock repoerts?
[19:18:04] <MarkX> hmm don't know about that, never used it
[19:18:38] <MarkX> basically just a plot that shows live data coming in, but the old data isn't over written
[19:22:15] <MarkX> actually i think i have an idea
[19:24:00] <MarkX> if i have an array going from 0 to -120, each time i get a new value i can put it to the top of the array and force all the other values down
[19:24:43] <MarkX> that would be a lot of array work though....
[19:24:47] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:24:49] <robertmaxrees> 0 to -120?
[19:24:58] <robertmaxrees> you can't do negative indices
[19:25:39] <MarkX> robertmaxrees, sorry the array would be from 0-120 but its x values would be from 0 to -120
[19:26:17] <taplar> panning right would go negative?
[19:26:30] <MarkX> yes
[19:26:47] <taplar> feels backwards
[19:27:05] <MarkX> wait when you say panning right
[19:27:06] <taplar> math plane wise it is backwards
[19:27:15] <MarkX> do you mean clicking and dragging right?
[19:27:24] <taplar> dragging left is panning right
[19:27:30] <MarkX> ohhhh
[19:27:33] <MarkX> no no
[19:27:44] <MarkX> i'm thinking panning left would go negative
[19:27:50] <taplar> ok
[19:29:07] <MarkX> okay i think i have a plan. let me write it up and see what i can come up with
[19:32:18] <`> hello
[19:32:54] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[19:33:04] <coldhead> hi rob
[19:33:13] <taplar> bonjour
[19:33:21] <Guest56810> hello
[19:33:35] <Guest56810> it is I
[19:33:47] <Guest56810> Roboman7
[19:34:17] <taplar> what happened to Roboman6?
[19:34:20] <taplar> did you kill him?
[19:34:23] <robertmaxrees> or 5
[19:34:44] <Roboman7> lol  i 8 him and 9
[19:34:59] <taplar> i can understand roboman4 sucked.  no one wants to be the first non prime number
[19:35:11] <Roboman7> lol
[19:35:50] <taplar> lovely math yokes
[19:36:17] <Roboman7> does :D i have a list of td elements i need to sort though them and go in order down them. can i do that usinf jquery?
[19:36:18] <robertmaxrees> yolks
[19:36:38] <taplar> 'sort' ?
[19:36:45] <robertmaxrees> "sort through them and go in order down them" - clarify plz
[19:37:49] <Roboman7> sorry not sort them :D just go down them in order. i have a list of tds and i need jquery that will go from one to the next
[19:38:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:38:06] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to do that?
[19:38:07] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:38:25] <TimCoal> yes you can selcet the required nodes and loop through the resulting set
[19:38:41] <Roboman7> i need something that can get the job done for my macro
[19:38:50] <robertmaxrees> ah.  yeah.  you want .each()
[19:39:01] <robertmaxrees> ahttps://api.jquery.com/each/
[19:39:03] <Roboman7> really timcook?
[19:39:07] <robertmaxrees> though most of the time you don't actually need that.
[19:39:24] <TimCoal> how are you getting the nodes?
[19:39:28] <Roboman7> thanks robertmaxrees
[19:39:50] <Roboman7> im getting the nodes throught imacros timCoal
[19:40:02] <Roboman7> imacrso recorder
[19:40:12] <robertmaxrees> can you mix imacros and jquery?
[19:40:24] <taplar> may need forEach
[19:40:26] <robertmaxrees> like, does that selection return a jquery object?
[19:41:18] <Roboman7> yeah i mix the imacro into the javascript and the jqery into the javascript too
[19:41:26] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[19:41:32] <robertmaxrees> alright.  then yeah, you can just use .each()
[19:41:33] <Roboman7> not sure
[19:41:57] <Roboman7> alright thanks thats on that page link u sent right ?
[19:42:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:42:10] <robertmaxrees> also feel free to check out learn.jquery.com
[19:42:33] <Roboman7> alright thanks guys :) sure thing :P thanks :)
[19:42:46] <taplar> Roboman2 would want you to
[19:43:09] <Roboman7> lol
[19:43:19] <taplar> don't disgrace his memory
[19:43:50] <Roboman2> i am ROBOMAN2 lol
[19:43:58] <taplar> ghosts...
[19:44:04] <Roboman2> lol
[19:44:38] <Roboman2> later man betta get learnin on my part :)
[19:51:23] <taplar> i think its slightly humorous any time i mess with a NodeList i always use the Array.prototype.forEach.call on it, rather than learning how to use it's iterator.
[19:51:33] <killer> hey , I used data-roles to load multiple id's by clicking on links , how can i make sure to run a particular function only when a particular id is loaded
[19:51:55] <taplar> data('roles') is an array?
[19:52:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:52:43] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us an example of what you mean, killer?
[19:52:56] <taplar> heh
[19:53:45] <killer> http://www.w3schools.com/jquerymobile/tryit.asp?filename=tryjqmob_start
[19:53:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:54:03] <robertmaxrees> w3schools --
[19:54:20] <taplar> i don't see any logic
[19:54:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:55:12] <taplar> try.jquery.com & learn.jquery.com i feel would serve you better
[19:55:17] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[19:56:02] <taplar> let the peeps who wrote the library teach you, :D
[19:56:36] <robertmaxrees> hell of
[19:56:49] <taplar> ?
[19:57:29] <robertmaxrees> people in northern california say "hella", which is kind of like saying "very".  but sometimes we use it to agree with something.
[19:57:44] <taplar> ah
[19:57:55] <taplar> i thought the 'of
[19:57:59] <taplar> ' was cut short
[19:58:11] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[19:58:19] <robertmaxrees> also i am weird and like to say "hell of" to piss people off.
[19:58:26] <taplar> lmao
[19:58:49] <taplar> like your shortening hell of( a deal)
[19:58:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah sorta
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> killer so you're going to abandon us?
[20:00:04] <robertmaxrees> either way, $('#someId').length
[20:00:09] <robertmaxrees> you can use that to check.
[20:01:10] <taplar> i like how the inclusion of jquery mobile makes the person a mobile developer according to this snipplet
[20:01:19] <taplar> i guess
[20:01:24] <robertmaxrees> CONGRATS
[20:01:26] <robertmaxrees> you wrote a code
[20:01:36] <taplar> here's your certificate.... now your first project
[20:01:57] <taplar> due next week.  not a problem right?  your using a framework
[20:02:08] <robertmaxrees> ~*jquery mobile*~
[20:03:00] <TimCoal> who needs logic?!
[20:03:20] <taplar> luber yards
[20:03:23] <taplar> lumber
[20:03:25] <taplar> fk i can't type
[20:03:35] <robertmaxrees> nah man.  luber/.
[20:03:39] <taplar> lol
[20:03:40] <robertmaxrees> just /leave it/
[20:04:09] <taplar> lol, i just can't.  they work with dangerous equipment. saws and all that.  can't be luber
[20:04:37] <taplar> *ahem* but back to the joke.  lumber yards!
[20:04:49] <robertmaxrees> I think you mean... "butt back to the joke"
[20:05:29] <taplar> i.... i have to retort
[20:06:01] <taplar> i may have spelt that wrong
[20:06:27] <D-rex> I think it's funny most of us will correct a typo but 90% of time the typo is understood by the reader
[20:06:45] <robertmaxrees> eeeeh, just enough room for ambiguity sometimes.
[20:06:50] <robertmaxrees> but yeah
[20:07:06] <taplar> i konw rgiht taht wohel biran thgin
[20:07:32] <D-rex> yu knw whim syin
[20:08:23] <taplar> wonder if that works in non english languages
[20:08:35] <D-rex> interesting thought
[20:08:44] <taplar> i guess so, as long as it is symbol based
[20:08:45] <D-rex> i would have to assume so
[20:08:56] <robertmaxrees> more complex than that.
[20:09:09] <taplar> but if you run into those that a symbol's definition is affected by a following character, :s
[20:09:52] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of languages where words are series of symbols that serve as a pronunciation guide.
[20:10:27] <taplar> not so much that.  i'm thinking of languages were a collection of symbols is the word.
[20:10:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd imagine chinese wouldn't work very well depending on the character set since they use character pairs that are a combo of "meaning" and "sounds like".
[20:10:34] <D-rex> isnt chinese read up to down
[20:10:38] <robertmaxrees> that, too.
[20:10:47] <taplar> up to down, right to left
[20:10:59] <robertmaxrees> is it also rtl?
[20:11:03] <taplar> maybe that's japanese
[20:11:03] <robertmaxrees> i thought it was left to right still.
[20:11:20] <taplar> all the anime books are LTR
[20:11:23] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[20:11:24] <robertmaxrees> you're right.
[20:11:29] <robertmaxrees> right to left.
[20:11:33] <taplar> err, right
[20:12:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, chinese and japanese are really interesting languages.
[20:12:24] <robertmaxrees> hangul is super neat, too.
[20:12:41] <taplar> which that's one of the interesting things about reading translated anime.  sometimes that translators will actually reorganize the panels to match our ltr tendencies
[20:14:17] <taplar> i have no clue about the korean pattern
[20:14:42] <robertmaxrees> they're ltr - pretty detailed letters, but they combine everything into 1 syllable blocks.
[20:16:05] <taplar> hmm
[20:16:16] <robertmaxrees> it's super flexible.
[20:17:57] <taplar> from crass jokes to contemplating other languages.  the depth of jquery cannot be underestimated.
[20:18:02] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[20:22:08] <D-rex> Nevre payed attention to other languages that heavily prior to web development though.
[20:24:04] <robertmaxrees> my dad taught speech and was a bit of a linguistics nerd so i heard a lot about like phonemes and stuff when growing up.
[20:25:33] <D-rex> dont you end that sentence in a prepostion son! go to your room
[20:25:40] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[20:25:52] <robertmaxrees> nah, more like him saying the word "labia" and me not having to giggle too much.
[20:26:11] <D-rex> hah
[20:27:38] <taplar> i think i heard george bush once thought we might have to send military support to labia
[20:27:47] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaahahahahahaha
[20:27:55] <taplar> get'er done, i guess
[20:28:08] <D-rex> good one
[20:28:30] <taplar> double joke with the bush?  *shrug*
[20:30:19] <taplar> though in george's defense, i guess it could have been a good idea.
[20:30:23] <taplar> clinton was all on board
[20:31:18] <taplar> something about, "I... will put my finger on this issue, and not stop until it is resolved!"  in his whole clinton swaggar
[20:31:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:12:45] <Jani_H> Could anyone help me with trying to create buttons to manage a list of values (https://jsfiddle.net/2gq824q2/34/)
[21:15:17] <taplar> there's an error in your console when you use the script
[21:17:06] <Jani_H> taplar:  Can you clarify?  Is there a way of debugging that I don't understand?
[21:17:30] <taplar> are you familiar with debugging in javascript?
[21:18:08] <Jani_H> taplar:  I am not... I did however open console on my browser and see that I'm missing $AllEntries.  I'll fix that now...
[21:18:56] <taplar> i'd recommend giving this site a read to get some more debugging tools in your dev belt, :) http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[21:20:01] <Jani_H> taplar:  Thanks - I'll have a look at that.
[21:21:28] <TimCoal> http://fixingthesejquery.com
[21:21:38] <TimCoal> ahh snap
[21:27:41] <Roboman2> hello guys i red throught the webpage u sent me thanks :) . Now i just need to see how to go down the page, first td,second td,third td,etc
[21:30:06] <taplar> which page was that again?
[21:30:41] <Roboman2> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[21:31:03] <taplar> k, so what's the question?
[21:31:51] <Roboman2> how do i make a program that will step throught the tds on a page in order
[21:32:04] <Roboman2> with jquery
[21:32:06] <taplar> that's what that method does
[21:34:19] <Roboman2> do you know where i can get a blank copy with out anything in it so i can work with it without confusion, i need a clean slate so i can see where to begin and insert my code
[21:34:47] <taplar> you can play around on jsfiddle.net
[21:35:00] <taplar> it has multiple jquery versions to choose from on site
[21:35:34] <taplar> when you get there, in the bottom left area you'll see "Javascript <cog>" in the rop right corner, click that to choose
[21:37:36] <Roboman2> https://jsfiddle.net/3kutvde8/  does this look about right
[21:38:25] <taplar> yep, however your asking about looping over tds, not lis
[21:38:45] <Roboman2> i need it to pause on each element run this code inside and then go to the next element and repeat
[21:38:54] <Roboman2> alright ill change it
[21:39:41] <Roboman2> https://jsfiddle.net/nysm7wkr/
[21:40:06] <taplar> yep
[21:40:19] <taplar> missing a closing ')' though
[21:41:48] <Jani_H> Roboman2:  I'm still a rookie but I tried looking at what you were trying to do.  Maybe it's completely the wrong approach but maybe it works? (https://jsfiddle.net/3kutvde8/1/)
[21:43:16] <taplar> close, couple issue with that one.  first the markup is invalid.  and missing a semi colon on the inner guy
[21:45:39] <Roboman2> yeah thats the right idea thanks :) taplar that one has some elements i guess  was missing :). im now trying to test it by getting it to change the color of the text in the tds but i cant get it to work
[21:45:48] <Roboman2> Jani_H
[21:48:06] <taplar> if all your trying to do is change the color, you really don't need the each
[21:48:34] <taplar> how are you trying to change the color?  inline, or do you have a class?
[21:51:07] <Roboman2> im trying to run a macro that clicks a link inside the td each time . im planning on using this jquery each to select the next td . so its a bit more complex thats my example :)
[21:51:37] <Roboman2> i can put javascript directly into this jquery for each right ?
[21:51:50] <taplar> jquery is javascript.
[21:52:51] <taplar> jquery is, over simplified, just a collection of javascript methods
[21:53:57] <Roboman2> alright cool , is there something that i can use to add javascript in plaace of addclass in this example?because im adding javascript not a class :D https://jsfiddle.net/vetq4u1w/
[21:54:01] <Roboman2> thanks
[21:54:37] <taplar> i don't understand the question
[21:55:15] <Roboman2> i want to change the "addclass" part of the code for a javascript block of code can i do that ?
[21:55:42] <taplar> your wanting to add a class to an element without jquery?
[21:56:41] <taplar> my earlier statement about not needing the each, your first statement, is because it could be written simply
[21:56:48] <taplar> $('td').addClass('foo');
[21:57:14] <Roboman8> no i want to run some javascript code inside this for each jquery so i have to type it inside some special "addclass" attribute or can i just type it in
[21:57:30] <taplar> just type it.  like i said, jquery is javascript
[21:57:41] <Roboman8> alright cool :)
[21:58:46] <Jani_H> taplar:  Would you be able to help me understand what I'm doing wrong on line 21 (https://jsfiddle.net/q354797e/)
[21:59:26] <taplar> you can't append strings and jquery objects
[21:59:55] <taplar> one sec
[22:01:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/q354797e/1/
[22:01:49] <taplar> side note, your options in your mark up are not closed
[22:02:20] <Jani_H> thanks - closed the options...
[22:02:31] <taplar> just my ocd, ^_^
[22:02:48] <Jani_H> can you help me understand why i often see $ in front of a variable (but it doesn't seem to be required)?
[22:03:18] <taplar> $ in front of a variable name is just a nameing pattern some (a lot) adopt to identify if a variable should contains a jquery object
[22:03:26] <taplar> it's not required
[22:03:46] <taplar> so if you name something starting with $, try to only assign jquery object to it
[22:03:57] <taplar> then later when you go to reference it, you'll know you don't need to wrap it in $()
[22:04:44] <taplar> cause $( $( something ) ) doesn't do anything and actually is wasted work
[22:05:32] <taplar> comprende?
[22:06:14] <Jani_H> not really... i looked up what Object meant when i was getting the _text_ [object] [object] output and didn't really understand.
[22:06:47] <taplar> Object is the base of pretty much everything in javascript.  Every thing is an object.
[22:07:34] <Jani_H> other than a string if they can't be combined? :)
[22:07:43] <taplar> everything is i an Object
[22:07:46] <Roboman8> https://jsfiddle.net/3Lwt2fcz/ i can go to town with this is this good ? taplar
[22:07:51] <taplar> strings are String, numbers are Number
[22:07:59] <taplar> all are built on top of Object
[22:08:25] <taplar> Roboman8: yup, roll with it
[22:08:43] <Roboman8> sweet thanks u know why this isnt working ? https://jsfiddle.net/mgm2w6a7/2/
[22:08:48] <taplar> if your going to play on the fiddle make sure to pull in jquery in the tab like i mentioned before
[22:09:21] <taplar> and that's invalid markup
[22:09:31] <taplar> td's cannot exist outside of a tr
[22:09:41] <taplar> <table> is one of the most restrictive tags in html
[22:09:57] <taplar> it inforces hierchary, otherwise it will not go into the dom
[22:10:42] <Roboman8> oh really thanks so if i fix that it should work? and how do i add jquery?
[22:10:57] <taplar> see that "JAVASCRIPT <cog>" in the top right corner of the textare?
[22:11:48] <taplar> it'll be under the frameworks options, and you'll want to change your load type to on body
[22:12:00] <taplar> *in body
[22:16:01] <taplar> how you doing Jani_H ?
[22:16:19] <Jani_H> taplar:  I've been reading about what an Object is.... :)
[22:16:27] <taplar> ah, k
[22:17:05] <Jani_H> i'm struggling to understand and maybe it's because I'm not knowledgable/experienced enough to walk through even the simple examples.
[22:17:33] <taplar> "All objects in JavaScript are descended from Object; all objects inherit methods and properties from Object.prototype, although they may be overridden. For example, other constructors' prototypes override the constructor property and provide their own toString() methods. Changes to the Object  prototype object are propagated to all objects unless the properties  and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along 
[22:17:34] <Jani_H> might be one of those Eureka moments as I continue to putter away :)
[22:17:41] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object
[22:18:18] <taplar> think of it like this
[22:18:34] <taplar> well, let me ask this first.  do you have experience in any other languages?
[22:20:36] <Jani_H> taplar: not to any level of proficiency.  I've managed to do some simple things in Perl for myself.  I'm trying to learn more about html (which I'm starting to feel someone comfortable with)
[22:20:43] <Roboman8> https://jsfiddle.net/mgm2w6a7/12/ my delay is not working :(
[22:20:50] <Roboman8> yeah lots
[22:21:04] <taplar> delay is only valid for animations, iirc
[22:21:18] <taplar> it doesn't take the place of setTimeout
[22:21:39] <taplar> lookup, "jQuery, delay"
[22:22:01] <taplar> Jani_H: ok, i'll try to make this analogy.  maybe it will help something click
[22:22:10] <Roboman8> thanks
[22:22:22] <taplar> Think about if you were talking about automotives
[22:22:43] <taplar> all automotives could be called "Vehicles" right?
[22:22:51] <Jani_H> I'm an automotive engineer so I like where this is going :)
[22:22:55] <taplar> sweet
[22:23:22] <Jani_H> taplar:  i agree that all automobiles can be called vehicles :)
[22:23:38] <taplar> so in automotives, everything is a Vehicle, so programatically we could create a construct called Vehicle
[22:24:01] <taplar> there are common things to all vehicles
[22:24:13] <taplar> you could probably tell me some, :)
[22:24:21] <taplar> err, fuel type
[22:24:35] <taplar> so you could say every vehicle uses fuel
[22:24:50] <taplar> so if you wanted to know the fuel you might make a method off of Vehicle for Vehicle.getFuelType()
[22:24:58] <taplar> right?
[22:25:15] <Jani_H> taplar:  okay - i think i'm following
[22:25:23] <taplar> ok, so now lets say we have a car
[22:25:29] <taplar> a car is a vehicle
[22:25:43] <taplar> so we could create a Car construct
[22:25:52] <taplar> cause he has methods and stuff particular to him
[22:26:00] <taplar> Car.getColor()
[22:26:04] <taplar> Car.getModel()
[22:26:05] <taplar> etc
[22:26:08] <taplar> right?
[22:26:18] <Jani_H> yeah - i follow
[22:26:35] <taplar> but car is also a vehicle.  so we should also be able to getFuelType of a car
[22:26:48] <taplar> so we can build it to "extend" Vehicle, when we make Car
[22:26:55] <taplar> meaning it has all the functions that Vehicle has
[22:27:05] <taplar> unless we change them to be different/more specific
[22:27:06] <Jani_H> okay - still following :)
[22:27:28] <taplar> so Car.getFuelType() still works, cause it is built on top of Vehicle
[22:27:45] <Jani_H> but something like Vehicle.getColor() wouldn't work?
[22:27:52] <taplar> you could
[22:28:05] <taplar> any vehicle could have a color, so it could be at that level, sure
[22:28:43] <taplar> but with that pattern you can kinda extrapolate how that would be built with things like Truck, or Motorcycle, or JetSki
[22:29:04] <taplar> that's what they do with Object.  Object is like your Vehicle
[22:29:15] <Jani_H> Right, all would full under the vehicle "construct"
[22:29:39] <taplar> Vehicle would have the basic, globally shared common things that are true for all vehicles
[22:29:54] <taplar> things built on it, add more, or change existing to be specific to themselves
[22:30:37] <Jani_H> so is Vehicle the only object in this example or would Car, Truck, Motorcycle also be objects?
[22:30:52] <taplar> they would be "Vehicle"'s
[22:31:38] <taplar> If Vehicle is the base object, Car, Truck, Motorcycle are objects built to extend it
[22:31:51] <taplar> s/object/construct
[22:31:51] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> If Vehicle is the base construct, Car, Truck, Motorcycle are constructs built to extend it
[22:32:22] <Jani_H> construct != object then...
[22:32:45] <taplar> in javascript, and other languages, the construct is called object
[22:32:58] <taplar> you could call it whatever in your other vehicle centric world, :)
[22:33:34] <Jani_H> could you toss a few jquery examples my way and maybe this will all click?
[22:33:53] <taplar> this is more getting to the grits of javascript, rather than jquery
[22:34:43] <taplar> i'll see if i can throw something together though
[22:45:58] <taplar> may not be the best example, not a pro with the prototyping, but maybe this will help some: https://jsfiddle.net/2d07pc19/
[22:47:49] <Jani_H> what does the _this_ mean?
[22:48:11] <taplar> 'this' is a keyword in javascript.  essentially it references the current context
[22:48:15] <Jani_H> does it relate to whatever is calling the function?
[22:48:43] <taplar> so within an object 'this' will reference the current object's instantiation
[22:49:08] <taplar> we have a Vehicle class, but that's like the blueprint for the variable
[22:49:38] <taplar> when we "new Vehicle()" we're creating a new variable of Vehicle each time, so multiple can exist in memory, all with their own internal variables
[22:50:43] <Jani_H> i understand the "new Vehicle()" portion.
[22:52:51] <taplar> this might be a good place for you to read.  it goes over the whole prototyping concept some: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript#Inheritance
[22:53:39] <Jani_H> just going back to the vehicle function.  are you basically setting default values for your vehicle "variables"?  I can't remember if they're called objects.
[22:53:49] <taplar> yep
[22:54:01] <Jani_H> okay - that makes sense now :)
[22:55:34] <Jani_H> i'm a bit confused by lines 18-22...
[22:55:59] <Jani_H> I understand you're creating a function called car that is taking a variable called 'color'
[22:56:51] <taplar> ln 22 is making it call the Vehicle constructor (the top method), passing along the arguments that were given to the new Car() call
[22:57:41] <Jani_H> which in "this" case is the color?
[22:57:50] <taplar> which line?
[22:58:02] <Jani_H> line 20
[22:58:15] <taplar> 'this' is the car we are creating
[22:58:29] <taplar> the "new Car()" variable being created
[22:58:45] <Jani_H> oh - okay.
[23:00:08] <Jani_H> what's the reason for ".prototype"
[23:00:22] <Jani_H> line 5 or 10
[23:00:22] <taplar> that's how javascript makes those shared functions
[23:00:52] <taplar> functions attached to a class with prototype will be available on every element you create with new ThatGuy()
[23:01:22] <taplar> notice how i only put getFuelType on Vehicle
[23:01:39] <taplar> but for all the others i'm doing OtherThing.prototype = Vehicle.prototype
[23:01:57] <taplar> that's making those others have the same shared functions as Vehicle
[23:02:05] <Jani_H> okay - i think i follow.  if you exclude .prototype then getFuelType would not be accessible from the Car class?
[23:02:10] <taplar> right
[23:04:28] <Jani_H> i guess this is all the basics to object oriented programming eh?
[23:04:45] <taplar> not really.  it's javascripts flavor of OOP
[23:04:55] <taplar> but the concepts are there
[23:06:01] <Jani_H> This will take awhile to wrap my head around but I'll get there eventually.
[23:06:11] <taplar> but i'd really recommend reading over that last link i gave for more in sight, or you can hit up ##javascript.  or both.
[23:06:15] <taplar> oh definitely
[23:06:36] <taplar> like I said, i'm not a prototype master myself, :)
[23:06:38] <Jani_H> taplar:  yeah - I've looked already at the link you sent and have it bookmarked to try and follow later.
[23:06:58] <taplar> i don't really deal with pure objects much
[23:07:05] <taplar> err, classes
[23:07:47] <taplar> but i'm fixing to hit the sack.  it's getting late here, ^_^
[23:08:25] <taplar> other's may be around to pipe in and help you more if you have questions.  i'm sure they've been watching and snickering at my fumbling explinations, :D
[23:08:28] <Jani_H> yeah - it's bedtime for me too :)

[23:23:27] <sally__> hello how do i link to jquery in my javasript file
[23:25:52] <Jani_H> sally___:  maybe something like what is shown on this page (http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp)
[23:26:26] <sally__> thanks ill check  it out :)
[23:27:11] <sally__> do you know how to put html into  jquery
[23:28:30] <TimCoal> what are you trying to achieve?
[23:29:02] <sally__> a link to jquery beause my  javascript code does not reconige it
[23:29:10] <sally__> TimCook
[23:29:56] <Jani_H> sally__:  would something like: <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script> work?
[23:30:29] <TimCoal> you need to include a link to jquery.js in the head of your page
[23:30:51] <sally__> yeah as long as i can past that into a javascript file :) does anyone know if i can past that into a javascript file .  im jusing a .js file
[23:31:23] <TimCoal> Jani_H that looks doable let me look at it

[23:32:25] <sally__> does anyone know how to add a link to a file such as that one in javascript?
[23:32:28] <Jani_H> sally__: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1140402/how-to-add-jquery-in-js-file
[23:33:10] <TimCoal> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script>
[23:33:23] <TimCoal> add that to the head of you doc
[23:34:36] <sally__> TimCoal i can add that to the head of my javascript .js file ?
[23:35:26] <MarkX> var data = []; data.push([delay, y]);
[23:35:42] <MarkX> does that mean data[0][0] == delay && data[0][1] == y?
[23:36:43] <TimCoal> Jani_H what level do you feel you are at with HTML and with javascript
[23:37:09] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  close to the very bottom
[23:37:34] <TimCoal> sally__ you would add that to the head of the HTML file
[23:38:27] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  It seems that sally__ is suggesting that there isn't "direct" access to the HTML file.
[23:38:32] <TimCoal> ok are you familure with HTML generally tags and that  i'm thinking <div> <ul> and <li>
[23:38:57] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  Yes, i'm familiar with HTML tags
[23:39:54] <Jani_H> sally__:  did you try pasting the 4 lines of code from the link I sent you into your .js file?
[23:40:23] <TimCoal> ok to remove the items it will be helpful if they are on a single tag so you you can remove one item and button text  etc goes
[23:40:46] <sally__> yeah i got this error Jani+_H
[23:40:48] <sally__> var script = document.createElement('script');
[23:41:18] <sally__> i got this error on that line ReferenceError: document is not defined, line 19 (Error code: -991)
[23:41:19] <TimCoal> i would use either <div>s or unordered list <ul><li>
[23:41:40] <sally__> i dont have html TimCoala
[23:41:57] <TimCoal> where are you writing your javascript?
[23:42:22] <sally__> in a js file with no html
[23:42:31] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  whatever you think works better I'm happy with using.  I'm comfortable understanding both <div> and <ul>.
[23:42:36] <TimCoal> where are you running it?
[23:42:43] <sally__> imacros
[23:42:50] <sally__> :)
[23:44:03] <TimCoal> ok its a choice, of using divs, because they are the generic container or a list.  there is not a lot in it, i prefer a list
[23:44:50] <TimCoal> do you mind if i prompt you rather than showing you?
[23:45:23] <Jani_H> TimCoal: I'm not sure I understand.  do you mean like an alert box for a prompt?
[23:45:44] <TimCoal> ahh imacros, i installed it once but never really used it
[23:46:51] <Jani_H> sally__:  Does this help?  it seems to answer your specific question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11579587/include-jquery-into-javascript-and-use-it-in-imacros

[23:48:26] <Jani_H> sally__: or this site claims to have a guide: https://www.devbattles.com/en/sand/post-2143-How_to_install_jQuery_in_iMacros
[23:49:06] <TimCoal> no as in me prompting you to do stuff
[23:49:09] <sally__> ah thanks that looks promsing ill check it out :)
[23:50:11] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  I'm happy with whatever approach you prefer.  Prompting me would be slower but I've got time :)
[23:51:17] <TimCoal> you do some stuff and i'll do some
[23:51:26] <Jani_H> sounds good.
[23:54:08] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  I put the new entries into a list (https://jsfiddle.net/q354797e/4/)
[23:54:33] <TimCoal> what is the datalist doing?
[23:54:54] <TimCoal> fiddle not found
[23:55:23] <TimCoal> extra ) on the url
[23:55:45] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  The datalist will be populated with a tonne of options.
[23:55:48] <sally__> thanks thats a bit better Jani_H :) and thank you too TimCoal
[23:55:57] <TimCoal> :)
[23:56:12] <TimCoal> youre welcome
[23:56:18] <Jani_H> glad to help :)
[23:57:01] <sally__> no say your welcome, and good byes to Roboman8
[23:57:19] <TimCoal> Jani_H do you want the datalist to be a dropdown list?
[23:57:27] <Roboman8> ha ha ha im back babbbbbbyyyy :)
[23:58:11] <Roboman8> he he he be u dident know i was Roboman8 didb u imm a master of disguise :) B) `                                                 diguise
[23:58:19] <TimCoal> you have a list to select a subset from?
[23:59:24] <Jani_H> TimCoal:  Nope, I'm happy with the datalist.  The end result will be populating the datalist with about 500 different test specs.  Each test spec also has a revision / year that won't be included in the datalist option but since the datalist doesn't constrain choices the user will type in the test spec (and it'll auto filter for them) and then they
[23:59:24] <Jani_H>  can type in a revision / year if desired.
