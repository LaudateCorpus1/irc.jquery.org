[00:25:23] <djQuery> did these go bye bye?
[00:25:28] <djQuery> http://blog.jquery.com/2010/10/04/new-official-jquery-plugins-provide-templating-data-linking-and-globalization/
[00:28:34] <thealphanerd> ajpiano: you around?
[00:28:38] <thealphanerd> could I pm you?
[00:34:15] <ANJ7>  in nikhiljoshua.tk/JS/carousel when I press the prev arrow the slide must go back but its not going
[00:35:13] <ANJ7> can anyone help me?
[00:36:19] <djQuery> !as @ ANJ7
[00:36:28] <djQuery> !ask @ ANJ7
[00:36:28] <b-ot> ANJ7: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:39:16] <ANJ7> I asked it before djQuery ^^
[00:39:24] <ANJ7> but no one was helping
[00:39:49] <djQuery> ANJ7, yeah looking now. Most likely you are not checking to see if you are on the first one
[00:40:27] <ANJ7> btw, djQuery can you help me?
[00:40:35] <ANJ7> in that ^^
[00:40:53] <ANJ7> sorry to ask again
[00:41:22] <guzzlefry> So, I'm facedesking hard right now. http://dpaste.com/31M3PCC
[00:42:05] <djQuery> ANJ7, can you stick it in a jsbin or jsfiddle where I can edit it
[00:42:18] <ANJ7> i'll try it
[00:42:29] <guzzlefry> in the imageCheck.check function, the inner if statement is firing more often than it should be...
[00:42:47] <djQuery> guzzlefry, god I hate setInterval
[00:43:24] <guzzlefry> I think it's necessary in this case.
[00:43:29] <guzzlefry> And not the issue that I can see.
[00:43:48] <djQuery> guzzlefry, still reading
[00:45:36] <ANJ7> http://jsfiddle.net/zd6annfr/
[00:46:23] <djQuery> guzzlefry, so you have a setInterval inside of a setInerval?
[00:46:31] <guzzlefry> I do?
[00:46:52] <djQuery> no sorry read it a little wrong a setTimeout inside a setInterval
[00:46:57] <guzzlefry> ah yeah
[00:47:18] <djQuery> guzzlefry, still wraping my head around it
[00:47:28] <djQuery> commenting code might help
[00:47:41] <Cork> guzzlefry: setTimeout(imageCheck.ajaxCheck(this) <-- this doesn't work
[00:47:48] <djQuery> lots of times I find my mistake when I am inserting the coments
[00:47:54] <Cork> this will execute ajaxCheck not put it in a timeout
[00:48:02] <guzzlefry> ...
[00:48:13] <guzzlefry> now I feel really dumb
[00:48:15] <guzzlefry> thanks
[00:48:23] <djQuery> hey Cork
[00:48:54] <Cork> guzzlefry: also remember that the imageCheck reference is lost when you give the function as a reference
[00:48:59] <Cork> o/ djQuery
[00:50:20] <ANJ7> djQuery: did you see my code
[00:50:45] <djQuery> ANJ7, yeah reading it now, everyone has to reinvent the slide
[00:51:04] <ANJ7> forward is working fine
[00:51:35] <Cork> ANJ7: $('arrow-prev') <--
[00:51:38] <Cork> you missed the dot
[00:53:20] <ANJ7> Cork: yea, you are right :)
[00:55:45] <guzzlefry> oh heh, <= IE9 don't support parameters in window.setInterval or window.setTimeout :/
[00:56:25] <Cork> guzzlefry: just use an anonymus function
[00:56:43] <Cork> just remember that the wrapper creates a new this variable
[00:56:51] <Cork> so you need to save it with a different variable name
[00:57:10] <djQuery> Cork, will this work?  var dir = $(this).data('direction'); var  currslide = $('active'), nextslide = curslide[direction]();
[00:57:43] <Cork> not sure what you're trying to do
[00:57:47] <Cork> but most likely no
[00:57:56] <Cork> $('active') doesn't return a function
[00:58:02] <Cork> also you have an active element?
[00:58:12] <djQuery> forgot .
[00:58:57] <djQuery> oh well too tired think straight bed time
[00:59:42] <djQuery> oh wait you seen any example of hooking a template upto an indexeddb
[01:00:13] <Cork> why would you want to do that ?!?
[01:00:53] <djQuery> cause I want to display tabular data that is stored client side in indexeddb
[01:01:11] <Cork> ah
[01:01:14] <Cork> sorry read wrong
[01:01:27] <Cork> read it as storing the template IN indexeddb -_-'
[01:01:53] <djQuery> Cork, well that should be possible but worthless
[01:01:54] <Cork> djQuery: basically any template engine should easily handle that
[01:02:04] <Cork> djQuery: ya, hence my question :)
[01:02:35] <djQuery> Cork, haven't found any examples, my google skills must be lacking
[01:03:16] <dimi1947> is there anywau I can manipulate what is returned from val()...it returns a string...in my case I am "playing" with times..."10:00" for example...and I would like this to becomw "10:30"
[01:03:39] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/fawokac/4/ line 32
[01:04:25] <djQuery> dimi1947, http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-input-types/#input-time
[01:07:27] <djQuery> dimi1947, it even did the work for you http://jsbin.com/dirixa/1/edit
[01:08:17] <djQuery> dimi1947, <input id="time_till" type="time" placeholder="till">
[01:08:46] <djQuery> although it does break your placeholder
[01:09:07] <Cork> dimi1947: you would have to modify the string you get
[01:09:32] <dimi1947> how...that is the main question here
[01:10:12] <djQuery> dimi1947, if you use a input of type time it will allready be formated when you get the value
[01:10:30] <djQuery> dimi1947, look at the console log of this <input id="time_till" type="time" placeholder="till">
[01:10:30] <Cork> djQuery: he wants to add 30 mins to the time
[01:10:32] <Cork> not format it
[01:10:58] <dimi1947> yes....cork....you got it right
[01:11:05] <djQuery> oh sorry.
[01:11:13] <Cork> dimi1947: you could use .replace() or you could use .split(':')
[01:11:31] <Cork> personally i would prob use replace(/:00/, ':30')
[01:12:09] <djQuery> dimi1947, split it on : add 30 check to see if it is greater than 60 subtract 60 if so and add 1 to the hours place
[01:12:26] <dimi1947> can I do what you suggest by removing type="time"...the placeholder is lost as already mentioned
[01:12:56] <djQuery> dimi1947, sure
[01:14:06] <dimi1947> jquery does not have .slpit()...where did you find it?
[01:14:25] <djQuery> split
[01:14:35] <Cork> dimi1947: its native js
[01:14:36] <djQuery> its part of array in javascript
[01:14:42] <djQuery> or rather string
[01:14:42] <Cork> no part of string
[01:15:32] <djQuery> dimi1947, just do a search on javascript split and you will find plety of docs
[01:15:45] <dimi1947> where do we conclude...split or replace?
[01:16:11] <Cork> dimi1947: both works, replace can take a function too if you want to do something more advanced
[01:16:23] <djQuery> well what if they chose 11:30 instead of 10?
[01:16:54] <Cork> djQuery: why would that matter?
[01:17:34] <dimi1947> to understand better what I am trying to do....do you see the 2 input elements in the jsbin?
[01:17:40] <djQuery> Cork, because the field has 20 options in it every half hour between 8:00 am and 11:30 pm
[01:18:11] <dimi1947> I am confused a little...you chat fast
[01:19:18] <dimi1947> the point being that till options are always half an hour later from what is chosen in the from input eleemnt
[01:20:05] <Cork> ah, then the question does matter :)
[01:20:20] <Cork> should till be 8:30 if from is 11:30?
[01:20:30] <dimi1947> no of course
[01:20:40] <dimi1947> it shoud be 12:00
[01:20:43] <Cork> but the range doesn't allow 12:00
[01:21:09] <Cork> as djQuery did notice before :)
[01:21:12] <djQuery> if   from is 10:00 then till is 10:30 if from is 1:30 then till is 2:00
[01:21:28] <dimi1947> yes....that is the point
[01:22:04] <Cork> the am/pm makes it a bit more tricky, but Date can be of help here
[01:22:26] <dimi1947> there is no need for am/pm since the format is 24h
[01:23:27] <dimi1947> and no need to worry about 00:00
[01:23:29] <djQuery> var vs = val.split(":"), h = vs[0], m = vs[1];
[01:24:06] <dimi1947> are you showing me how to perform the manipulation?
[01:24:06] <Cork> then var time = from.split(':'); var till = new Date(0,0,0,time[0],time[1],0); till.setMinutes(till.getMinutes() + 30);
[01:24:20] <Cork> and it will do the time modification for you
[01:24:43] <djQuery> dimi1947, Cork ^^^ better than where I was going
[01:25:07] <Cork> [till.getHours(), till.getMinutes()].join(':')
[01:25:30] <dimi1947> there is one small detail...I am using a plugin and the times are produced by it...not a date object...line 27,28
[01:26:01] <Cork> dimi1947: the split handles the string
[01:26:10] <dimi1947> ok...
[01:26:12] <Cork> the new Date creates an object to do the modification with
[01:26:27] <Cork> one min
[01:27:46] <djQuery> Cork, dont think it will looks like it will just set it and not incriment the hours if needed
[01:27:59] <Cork> js> var from = '10:20', time = from.split(':'), till = new Date(0,0,0,time[0],time[1],0); till.setMinutes(till.getMinutes() + 30); print([till.getHours(), till.getMinutes()].join(':'))
[01:28:03] <b-ot> Cork: 10:50
[01:28:13] <Cork> djQuery: Date handles that for you
[01:28:17] <Cork> js> var from = '10:50', time = from.split(':'), till = new Date(0,0,0,time[0],time[1],0); till.setMinutes(till.getMinutes() + 30); print([till.getHours(), till.getMinutes()].join(':'))
[01:28:20] <b-ot> Cork: 11:20
[01:29:17] <Cork> i often curse Date, but that is one of the few things really good with it
[01:29:18] <djQuery> Cork, cool from the .setMinutes I was thinking is was just basicaly moving the minute hand without affecting the hour hand
[01:29:44] <djQuery> would have thought it would be named addMinutes
[01:30:01] <Cork> djQuery: look at it again
[01:30:08] <Cork> it is getMinutes() + 30
[01:30:13] <Cork> so it isn't addMinutes
[01:30:36] <Cork> djQuery: also i often use this to find how many days is in the month
[01:30:47] <djQuery> ?
[01:31:16] <Cork> js> var now = new Date(); now.setDate(-1); print(now.getDate())
[01:31:17] <djQuery> what add 31 days and then see what day you are on?
[01:31:20] <b-ot> Cork: 27
[01:31:27] <Cork> gah right
[01:31:50] <Cork> js> var now = new Date(); now.setMonths(now.getMonths() + 1); now.setDate(0); print(now.getDate())
[01:31:54] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[01:32:04] <Cork> humf
[01:32:23] <Cork> js> var now = new Date(); now.setMonth(now.getMonth() + 1); now.setDate(0); print(now.getDate())
[01:32:25] <b-ot> Cork: 31
[01:32:29] <Cork> there we go
[01:33:25] <djQuery> Cork I might be coming back to this tomorrow
[01:33:54] <djQuery> I need to insert a new header row every time the week of the year changes
[01:34:09] <djQuery> nm got it in head allready
[01:34:27] <djQuery> just so tired don't know if I will remember tomorrow
[01:34:47] <Cork> djQuery: that is what you have irc logs for :)
[01:37:54] <djQuery> Cork, dang there is not native .getWeekNumber
[01:38:12] <Cork> day
[01:38:28] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getDay
[01:40:48] <djQuery> cork basicaly I want to group a table based on week
[01:41:07] <Cork> djQuery: parse the date and use getDay()
[01:41:11] <Cork> then sort based on that
[01:53:29] <dimi1947> in concluding...I use split and date object?
[01:53:47] <Cork> dimi1947: yes
[01:53:59] <Cork> it's the most robust solution
[01:59:49] <Tumulte> hello
[02:01:02] <Tumulte> I want to read data from a multiple file input. I used to use  $(this).prop('files'), but apparently it doesn't work in 1.11
[02:01:24] <Cork> Tumulte: it should work just fine
[02:01:38] <Cork> though this.files is prob shorter
[02:03:19] <Tumulte> Cork: ok, so it's not deprecated. That's a valuable information
[02:03:37] <Cork> Tumulte: .prop is just a method to access the property on the dom element
[02:03:58] <Omar-> good morning
[02:03:58] <Cork> so as long as this.files exist $(this).prop('files') should
[02:04:10] <frank_o> Howdy
[02:09:19] <frank_o> I'm trying to poll for new articles in my Rails app. It will return `304 Not Modified` if the content is unchanged -- but as for `Last-Modified` and `If-Modified-Since` -- I seem to get success regardless of whether or not the content has been modified. Is that normal? If so, what would I have to check for in the `if` inside the `success`?
[02:09:24] <frank_o> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fffd29139c29d4abeca5
[02:11:51] <Cork> frank_o: yes it is normal
[02:12:05] <Cork> frank_o: the browser sends "i have data from time x"
[02:12:18] <Cork> frank_o: if the server sees that data to be up to date it returns 304
[02:12:25] <Cork> and the browser uses the data it has in cache instead
[02:14:21] <frank_o> Cork: Cool.. so basically now all I need to do is get jQuery to recognize the 304?
[02:14:35] <Cork> frank_o: 3xx is hidden from js
[02:14:52] <Cork> the browser transparently resolves this before it gives the result to the script
[02:15:05] <Cork> xhr never returns state 3xx
[02:15:18] <frank_o> oh i see..
[02:15:21] * frank_o adds that to his comments
[02:16:22] <frank_o> so.. what should be inside `success` to determine whether or not it should start fetching new content?
[02:16:38] <Cork> frank_o: you can't use 3xx for that
[02:16:58] <Cork> you should have a separate resource you can periodically poll for state
[02:18:31] <Omar-> hi frank_o
[02:19:53] <Tumulte> Cork: in my script I run a while on files = $(this).prop('files'). But now "files.length" = 1
[02:20:16] <Cork> Tumulte: could you create a jsfiddle?
[02:20:23] <Tumulte> Cork: just a minut
[02:21:04] <frank_o> Cork: heres the full example, it should have periodic polling: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/37efe4281f86d361f359 ...
[02:21:36] <Cork> frank_o: ok?
[02:22:28] <dimi1947> I tried the code and if I choose 10:30.. get back 11:0...var till=new Date(0,0,0,time[0],time[1],0);
[02:22:28] <dimi1947> till.setMinutes(till.getMinutes()+30);
[02:22:29] <dimi1947> print ([till.getHours(),till.getMinutes()].join(':'))
[02:22:54] <Cork> dimi1947: print() at the end is to make js> work
[02:22:56] <lilsammy> im confused I have ajax sending this as post data, [{"company_address_1":"asdasd"},{"company_address_2":"asdasdas"},{"company_city":"sadsadas"}] but I can't seem to read it in PHP on the other end
[02:22:57] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:23:02] <Cork> you don't use it in your normal code
[02:23:41] <Cork> lilsammy: what is that suppose to be?
[02:23:56] <dimi1947> sorry one correction...I do not use print  here is my code var time=from.split(":");
[02:23:56] <dimi1947>            var till=new Date(0,0,0,time[0],time[1],0);
[02:23:56] <dimi1947>            till.setMinutes(till.getMinutes()+30);
[02:23:56] <dimi1947>            var close=[till.getHours(),till.getMinutes()].join(':');
[02:23:56] <dimi1947>            console.log(close);
[02:24:04] <frank_o> Cork: wasn't that what you meant by periodically polling for state?
[02:24:06] <lilsammy> just example post data its the source of the network request
[02:24:12] <Cork> dimi1947: please don't post multi lines in the channel
[02:24:20] <dimi1947> ok...sorry
[02:24:26] <lilsammy> I can't seem to read it with PHP as $_POST vars though
[02:24:37] <Cork> frank_o: i meant if you want to get the state the server is in you would have to ask for that directly
[02:24:44] <dimi1947> there is still a last digit missing
[02:24:45] <Cork> frank_o: 3xx isn't exposed, so you can't use that
[02:24:56] <lilsammy> oh shit I think I f'ed up
[02:24:58] <Cork> dimi1947: ah
[02:25:06] <Cork> ya, you have to pad minutes
[02:25:08] <Cork> forgot about that
[02:25:27] <frank_o> oh like that, yeah
[02:26:03] <Cork> js> print('00'.slice(2 - '0'.length) + '0')
[02:26:07] <b-ot> Cork: 00
[02:26:14] <Cork> heh bad choice of number
[02:26:18] <Cork> js> print('00'.slice(2 - '5'.length) + '5')
[02:26:20] <b-ot> Cork: 05
[02:27:22] <dimi1947> the code you typed...where does is fit?
[02:27:56] <Cork> [till.getHours(),('00'.slice(2 - till.getMinutes().length) + till.getMinutes()].join(':')
[02:28:04] <lilsammy> ahhhh I just needed to decode the request ffs!
[02:28:34] <dimi1947> one question...with print js code is executed here?
[02:29:07] <Cork> dimi1947: no its js> that does that
[02:29:10] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:29:15] <Uhkis> :D
[02:29:23] <dimi1947> js>
[02:29:35] <Cork> the bot is a bit silly and doesn't print the result of the last line though
[02:29:41] <Uhkis> js> print 5+5;
[02:29:42] <Cork> so you need to use print()
[02:29:44] <b-ot> Uhkis: No output.
[02:29:55] <Cork> Uhkis: it's a function
[02:29:58] <Uhkis> js> print(5+5);
[02:30:01] <b-ot> Uhkis: 10
[02:30:11] <dimi1947> js>print(5+5);
[02:30:32] <Cork> the space
[02:30:38] <Uhkis> Cork: so php of me
[02:30:50] <Cork> heh
[02:30:55] <dimi1947> js> print(5+5);
[02:30:57] <b-ot> dimi1947: 10
[02:30:57] <Cork> Uhkis: so old php of you
[02:31:04] <dimi1947> at last
[02:31:15] <dimi1947> so you need js> and print
[02:31:18] <b-ot> dimi1947: No output.
[02:31:36] <Cork> js> print("yes") @ dimi1947
[02:31:39] <b-ot> dimi1947: No output.
[02:31:44] <Cork> <_<'
[02:31:46] <Cork> sigh
[02:31:56] <Cork> js> print("yes") // @ dimi1947
[02:31:59] <b-ot> dimi1947: yes
[02:32:01] <Uhkis> better use that jsfiddle, boys! :D
[02:32:02] <Cork> XD
[02:32:10] <dimi1947> one problem is I cannot copy individual lines
[02:32:34] <Cork> dimi1947: use jsfiddle for longer snippets
[02:32:39] <Cork> it makes it easier to answer
[02:33:11] <dimi1947> can you type your code in mu fiddle...I do not mind working...just to be there so I can copy it
[02:33:28] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/fawokac/5/
[02:37:10] <Cork> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/pmLv2q0r/
[02:42:42] <frank_o> Cork: minor rephrase:
[02:42:47] <frank_o> I'm trying to poll for new articles in my Rails app using conditional HTTP caching. My server will return `Last-Modified` -- which I'm using to set `If-Modified-Since` -- but where do I go from here, how do I find out when the content has changed?
[02:42:51] <frank_o> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/558b1454606c7171687f
[02:43:34] <Cork> frank_o: if the server doesn't set a header; you can't
[02:44:22] <frank_o> Cork: the server should set `Last-Modified` (i just completed https://robots.thoughtbot.com/introduction-to-conditional-http-caching-with-rails)
[02:44:47] <Cork> frank_o: then check and see if the browser merges those headers in
[02:44:54] <frank_o> super confused about the client-side though
[02:45:12] <Cork> frank_o: if the server returns 304 you get the cached response
[02:45:17] <Cork> including the cached headers
[02:45:25] <frank_o> Cork: yep, `xhr.setRequestHeader("If-Modified-Since", glob.lastModifiedDate);` succeeds and i can see it in dev tools
[02:45:41] <Cork> frank_o: that is set, not get
[02:45:49] <Cork> you need to check the header when you get the data
[02:45:54] <frank_o> ah ok..
[02:46:10] * Omar- slaps frank_o around a bit with a large trout
[02:46:24] <Omar-> frank_o listen to Cork carefully.
[02:46:26] <Omar-> :P
[02:46:32] <dimi1947> cork there is one last details....when selecting 09:00 for example the code gives 9:30...I want it to be 09:30...in 24h format always
[02:46:39] <dimi1947> sorry...
[02:46:49] <dimi1947> thanks for the fiddle though
[02:46:50] <Cork> dimi1947: it is
[02:46:53] <frank_o> yeah thats the main thing im confused about. why does everybody keep on saying "you need to set if-modified-since"? cant i just save the last-modified to a variable, and compare that against the new "Last-Modifieds" on subsequent requests?
[02:47:00] <Cork> dimi1947: you have to add the same padding for hours if you want that
[02:47:38] <Cork> dimi1947: Date returns numbers so you have to add the padding zeros if you want them
[02:48:07] <Cork> js could really use s formatting tool for numbers :/
[02:53:42] <Xatenev> Heya
[02:53:51] <Xatenev> when does "success" exactly triggers @jquery?
[02:53:53] <Xatenev> in an ajax call?
[02:54:18] <Cork> Xatenev: uh, when the request comes back and isn't an error?
[02:54:24] <Xatenev> :\
[02:54:27] <Cork> or what do you mean?
[02:54:27] <Xatenev> Because I make a request
[02:54:30] <Xatenev> it returns 200 OK 819ms
[02:54:40] <Xatenev> but it only goes into the complete: but not into the success:
[02:54:54] <Cork> have you bound the error/fail handler?
[02:54:57] <Xatenev> and I cant see why, because inspect tells me the ajax call is ok (200) :\
[02:55:27] <Xatenev> now yes
[02:55:35] <Xatenev> parseerror
[02:55:40] <Cork> :)
[02:55:44] <Cork> there you go
[02:56:20] <Xatenev> wheeey solved
[02:56:20] <Xatenev> :p
[02:56:22] <Xatenev> thanks mate
[02:56:39] <Xatenev> obv im too dumb to do easy debugging xd
[02:56:55] <frank_o> thanks again guys, Cork, Omar-
[02:56:58] <frank_o> brb
[03:02:12] <harshgarg7696> hey
[03:20:35] <dimi1947> cork I am trying to pad zero to the hours but I cannot....I assume the code must be similar to the minutes code
[03:20:45] <Cork> yup
[03:21:51] <Cork> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/pmLv2q0r/1/
[03:22:10] <dimi1947> for example....'00'.slice(minutes.length)...slice is suppose to work with arrays....I do not understand why you attach it in 'OO'
[03:22:18] <dimi1947> thanks for the code by the way
[03:22:26] <Cork> dimi1947: no slice works with strings too
[03:22:32] <dimi1947> oh
[03:22:46] <Cork> basically it takes the length of the string minutes as an offset to what character to start at
[03:22:59] <Cork> if minutes is == '5'
[03:23:04] <Cork> then length == 1
[03:23:08] <dimi1947> oh...I have no words to thank you
[03:23:21] <Cork> so slice grabs the offset 1- of the string == '0'
[03:23:41] <dimi1947> yes...I understand the part about length
[03:23:53] <Cork> the part was about slice not length :)
[03:26:32] <dimi1947> no...I mean I understand the example about length
[03:31:02] <morenoh149> anyone familiar with $.get() ?
[03:31:15] <morenoh149> I want to pass the server an array of skills
[03:31:16] <Cork> ?ask @ morenoh149
[03:31:16] <b-ot> morenoh149: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:31:26] <Cork> also
[03:31:28] <Cork> ?paste
[03:31:28] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:32:09] <morenoh149> I tried $.get('url', { skills: arr }, callback) but this produces a request url?skills=skill1&skills=skill2
[03:32:23] <morenoh149> how do I instead do ?skills=[array]
[03:32:49] <Cork> morenoh149: params can't have arrays like that
[03:33:10] <Cork> if you want to send json as the value of a param key you have to json encode it first
[03:33:19] <Cork> { skills: JSON.stringify(arr) }
[03:33:21] <morenoh149> perhaps a comma seperated list then?
[03:33:31] <Cork> params can't do that either
[03:33:54] <Cork> arrays in param is ?skill[]=v&skill[]=vskill[]=vskill[]=v
[03:34:10] <Cork> that becomes skill=['v', 'v', 'v'] server side
[04:11:43] <null__bpointer> jquery plugin coding question, how is this most elegantly achieved? http://pastebin.com/yEhLRfiP thx!
[04:12:27] <Cork> null__bpointer: $(this).find('.the-class').click
[04:12:41] <null__bpointer> Ah, okay. Thx.
[04:12:43] <Cork> or if you have multiple elements $(this).on('click', '.the-class')
[04:13:09] <null__bpointer> And how do I best check if my plugin function has already been called on an DOM node?
[04:13:15] <Cork> null__bpointer: also don't forget to use this.each(function() {}) around your plugin code
[04:13:15] <null__bpointer> prevent double calling
[04:13:36] <Cork> null__bpointer: store the state in .data('your-plugin-name')
[04:14:52] <null__bpointer> is this data kept in jquery or is it added to the dom node as an attribute value?
[04:15:05] <Cork> in jquery
[04:15:11] <null__bpointer> ok, thanks a lot.
[04:16:02] <null__bpointer> as for the this.each(function() {}),what do you mean exactly?
[04:16:23] <Cork> null__bpointer: if you run on this.click for example
[04:16:34] <Cork> the plugin will only really work if you only give it one element
[04:16:44] <Cork> you should use .each to loop the elements given
[04:16:55] <Cork> this isn't always true, but most of the time
[04:17:23] <Cork> null__bpointer: for you're original code this.attr('id') is an example of what would break if you gave the plugin two elements
[04:17:38] <null__bpointer> ah okay i understand
[04:18:04] <Cork> remember that this inside the each loop is the raw dom element
[04:18:13] <Cork> so you need to use $(this) there (just like outside plugins)
[04:18:24] <null__bpointer> i am coding an javascript ui widget, it is always one element supplied that's to be turned into the widget
[04:19:06] <Cork> null__bpointer: there is no reason to force the user to call it multiple times if they have two elements they want to make into a widget
[04:19:53] <Cork> <div id="widget1"></div><div id="widget2"></div> $('div').myWidget();
[04:21:26] <null__bpointer> mh if i want a function widgetElement.doSomething() i need a constructor in the plugin which is only called on Element.myWidget() ... how is a constructor commonly expressed in a jquery plugin?
[04:22:04] <Cork> null__bpointer: $(element).myWidget('doSomething')
[04:22:21] <Cork> null__bpointer: i recommend having a look at widgetfactory
[04:23:22] <null__bpointer> u mean the input function's input parameters determine if it is called as a constructor or not
[04:23:29] <null__bpointer> yeha thx there is still a lot to learn i see
[04:23:40] <null__bpointer> *the function's input parameters
[04:23:50] <Cork> null__bpointer: the myWidget function checks if it is initialized
[04:24:04] <Cork> and if it is it checks if the first argument exist in its instance
[04:24:08] <Cork> and if it does calls it
[04:24:13] <Cork> (widget factory does this for you)
[04:25:02] <null__bpointer> so it's best practise to base my plugin on a widgetfactory template? :)
[04:25:23] <Cork> null__bpointer: not really, but it is a good baseplate to use for WIDGETS
[04:25:35] <Cork> it is not good at all if you aren't making a widget
[04:26:05] <null__bpointer> because my plan is to make a very basic widget that's soley dependent on jquery, that way super leightweight.
[05:09:20] <seaders> Hey guys, I’ve a really long page of links which, when you click on them, open a small iFrame that contains a really long list
[05:09:25] <seaders> Vid of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SjvtYKOuas
[05:09:39] <seaders> Built completely with jquerymobile
[05:10:05] <seaders> On desktop, it’s not too bad, but on mobile, when you’re scrolling the iframe
[05:10:35] <seaders> when you get to the bottom of it, if you’re still scrolling (as what happens quite a bit)
[05:10:41] <seaders> it scrolls down the main page
[05:10:45] <Cork> seaders: scrolls that isn't the main scroll is often laggy on mobile
[05:10:53] <seaders> it’s not that it’s laggy
[05:10:58] <seaders> it’s that it does like the video
[05:11:07] <seaders> that scrolls away from the popup
[05:11:35] <seaders> I’ve tried a few disable scroll JS tricks, but they were all ugly and didn’t perform nicely
[05:12:02] <seaders> so then I thought hiding the main page content would mean the main page wouldn’t need to scroll
[05:12:14] <seaders> but when I do that, it cuts off the bottom of the content
[05:12:59] <seaders> http://i.imgur.com/SBfvwM6.png
[05:13:24] <seaders> when the popup is popped up, I’d really like it to be truly modal
[05:13:33] <seaders> that nearly nothing can get back to the main page
[05:13:38] <seaders> without clicking the x button
[05:16:46] <seaders> anyone any idea how to do it nicely?
[05:24:19] <Omar-> seaders
[05:24:29] <seaders> yep?
[05:24:37] <Omar-> what's the problem with the popup?
[05:24:49] <seaders> The popup is working fine
[05:24:56] <seaders> it’s the scrolling that’s the problme
[05:25:07] <seaders> both the main page that creates the popup is really long
[05:25:12] <seaders> and the popup is really long
[05:25:23] <seaders> so when it pops up, and you scroll down
[05:25:35] <seaders> if you scroll to the bottom of the iframe in the popup
[05:25:44] <seaders> you then start scrolling the main page
[05:25:46] <seaders> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SjvtYKOuas
[05:26:04] <seaders> that’s it recorded on the desktop
[05:26:10] <seaders> but it’s more what happens on mobile
[05:26:14] <Omar-> this is normal because popup is a div within the page
[05:26:24] <Omar-> try to make the popup external not internal
[05:26:38] <Omar-> do you know how?
[05:26:46] <seaders> nope, never knew there was a difference
[05:27:08] <seaders> oh, you mean an *actual* popup, is it?
[05:27:13] <seaders> like a new window?
[05:27:31] <Omar-> no, jQM offers internal/external popups
[05:27:40] <Omar-> like header/footers/panels
[05:27:53] <seaders> ok
[05:27:55] <Omar-> external widgets dont belong to a specific page
[05:28:09] <Omar-> you can access them from any page
[05:28:18] <Omar-> and should be placed outside any page div.
[05:28:34] <Omar-> their direct parent should be <body> or pagecontainer div
[05:29:15] <seaders> my current popup is a div within the ui-page div
[05:29:37] <seaders> so you’re saying shifting it out of there, one parent up
[05:29:46] <Omar-> http://stackoverflow.com/a/22910825/
[05:29:51] <Omar-> yup
[05:30:01] <Omar-> check my answer in the link above
[05:30:05] <seaders> cool, trying that now, 2 secs
[05:30:36] <Omar-> sure
[05:32:59] <seaders> hmmm, my whole content disappears
[05:33:35] <Omar-> seaders share your code pls
[05:33:40] <Omar-> jsfiddle it
[05:37:07] <seaders> http://jsfiddle.net/6od5t76L/
[05:37:27] <seaders> not displaying 100% correctly, but I think it’s still showing the correct (what’s going wrong) behaviour
[05:37:58] <seaders> the horseIframe is being loaded from elsewhere, so I can’t show it
[05:39:05] <seaders> I’m also perfectly happy with manipulating the main page to ensure that it doesn’t need to scroll
[05:39:23] <Omar-> i'll check it
[05:39:24] <seaders> I did a $('.ui-content *').hide(); when the popup popped up
[05:39:24] <Omar-> sec
[05:39:32] <seaders> but that then cut off the popup
[05:39:35] <seaders> ok, cheers
[05:39:40] <seaders> appreciate this, thanks
[05:42:05] <Omar-> seaders http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/cv69ngxx/
[05:42:08] <Omar-> check it
[05:42:40] <seaders> ahhh
[05:42:57] <seaders> it’s not affecting the popup (the shortening of the main page) *because* it’s external
[05:42:59] <seaders> yeah?
[05:43:20] <Omar-> yea
[05:43:39] <Omar-> $('.ui-content').hide() is enough, you dont need *
[05:43:55] <Omar-> hiding the wrapper will hide anything within it
[05:44:10] <seaders> lovely
[05:44:13] <seaders> that’s working perfectly now
[05:44:16] <seaders> thanks
[05:44:18] <Omar-> :)
[05:44:24] <seaders> never knew about the external-thing
[05:44:24] <Omar-> anytime!
[05:44:31] <Omar-> read docs ;)
[05:44:36] <seaders> ah, I kno!
[05:44:40] <seaders> I did
[05:44:47] <Omar-> header/footer/panel/popups can be external
[05:45:03] <seaders> but when I saw it cutting the popup in half, I got reminded of damn text boxes in MS Word :D
[05:45:08] <seaders> scared me
[05:45:12] <Omar-> but you need to initialize them manually
[05:45:29] <Omar-> $(function () { $("popup").popup().enhanceWithin() });
[05:46:34] <seaders> getcha
[05:46:55] <Omar-> .enhanceWithin() method is used to initialize conents within the popup
[05:47:20] <Omar-> $("panel").panel().enhanceWithin()
[05:47:27] <Omar-> same for panels
[05:47:48] <seaders> getcha
[05:47:58] <seaders> I think I’d used it previously for a totally different problem
[05:48:08] <seaders> but I just didn’t complete understand what was causing it this time
[05:48:17] <seaders> which meant I didn’t really know the correct solution
[05:48:29] <seaders> definitely understand now though
[05:56:49] <sharonMARIPUSSY> hey all! I'm creating a phonegap app and can't seem to get the resizable jquery function to work on my image....any leads??
[05:57:30] <sharonMARIPUSSY> hey all! I'm creating a phonegap app and can't seem to get the resizable jquery function to work on my image....any leads??
[06:02:44] <Omar-> seaders good luck!
[06:26:04] <sharonMARIPUSSY> hey all! I'm creating a phonegap app and can't seem to get the resizable jquery function to work on my image....any leads??
[06:35:03] <BillCriswell> sharonMARIPUSSY: This should help: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[06:35:40] <sharonMARIPUSSY> thanks!
[06:36:30] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[06:46:00] <sharonMARIPUSSY> my jquery slider won’t show up on phonegap
[06:46:02] <sharonMARIPUSSY> any leads?
[06:49:40] <NoiseEee> you should check phonegap support really
[06:49:52] <Omar-> sharonMARIPUSSY are you mixing jQuery-Mobile and jQuery-ui?
[06:49:58] <sharonMARIPUSSY> yes
[06:50:13] <Omar-> load jQuery-Mobile after jQuery-ui
[06:50:18] <sharonMARIPUSSY> and ive intergrated touch punch
[06:50:19] <sharonMARIPUSSY> as well
[06:50:23] <Omar-> why are you using jq-ui?
[06:50:43] <sharonMARIPUSSY> for the dragging, resizing of an image that you can control
[06:51:31] <Omar-> sharonMARIPUSSY you can drag it without the need to use any library
[06:51:52] <Omar-> use touchevents
[06:52:10] <Omar-> 50 lines of code is better than the whole library
[06:53:32] <Omar-> i made that code to "double-tap" to enlarge and drag image
[06:53:33] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/keqari/1/edit?js
[06:53:53] <Omar-> image is only draggable when its enlarged
[06:53:59] <Omar-> use the code, it's free
[06:56:20] <sharonMARIPUSSY> !
[06:56:26] <sharonMARIPUSSY> thanks Omar!
[06:56:51] <sharonMARIPUSSY> I appreciate it. As i get better with javascript I will definitely stop using these ridiculous libraries
[06:58:41] <decx> commendable goal, but don'T forget that greatness is built on the backs of giants
[07:00:02] <NoiseEee> s/backs/necks
[07:00:54] <decx> in clowncollege they say that greatness is built in the slacks of giants
[07:03:06] <BillCriswell> touchpunch is a pretty small library
[07:03:19] <BillCriswell> well.. shim
[07:03:32] <decx> is that like hammer?
[07:03:53] <BillCriswell> no, just makes jquery ui widgets work with touch devices
[07:04:25] <decx> they dont?
[07:04:37] <BillCriswell> not out of the box
[07:04:52] <decx> i forgot all about ui
[07:04:56] <decx> havent used it lateley
[07:05:01] <decx> ly
[07:05:15] <BillCriswell> i've been using draggable and droppable a lot at work
[07:05:24] <BillCriswell> with touch screens
[07:05:34] <BillCriswell> running IE lol
[07:05:37] <BillCriswell> which isn't so bad
[07:05:52] <decx> still not succinct alternative?
[07:05:58] <BillCriswell> i really want to play with the scroll snapping stuff a bit, find it a little odd it's done in CSS but since it's a kiosk it's ok
[07:06:01] <decx> is that a word?
[07:06:41] <BillCriswell> succinct? it didn't get the red underline so I guess it's ok.
[07:07:15] <BillCriswell> I think touchpunch is as simple as it gets for right now haha
[07:07:21] <decx> spell check in irc?
[07:07:41] <BillCriswell> chrome, been using irccloud.com cause limechat got all weird on me
[07:10:06] <BillCriswell> it also makes irc a lot easier to ignore since it's just a pinned tab in chrome haha
[07:25:42] <GoSox> I don't know if this is really a jQuery question or what. But I'm having this really annoying but in safari (mobile and desktop) where .svg images that are changed dynamically, will randomly, without any logic, sometimes render at a tiny fraction of their normal size. Then keep switching and they'll go back to normal. It's a big problem for this site i'm working on
[07:25:47] <GoSox> and here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/op3u6uam/3/
[07:28:12] <Cork> GoSox: ya, animated svg is really really buggy in many browsers
[07:28:23] <Cork> the solution most pick is, don't use animated svg :/
[07:28:37] <GoSox> the svg's are static
[07:28:49] <GoSox> and even chrome, a fellow webkit browser, doesn't have this issue
[07:29:02] <Cork> chrome is a blink browser
[07:29:04] <Cork> not webkit
[07:29:09] <GoSox> since when?
[07:29:09] <Cork> related, but not the same
[07:29:23] <Cork> uh like over a year
[07:29:36] <Cork> ?g google forks webkit blink
[07:29:37] <b-ot> Cork: Google Forks WebKit And Launches Blink, A New Rendering ... → http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/google-forks-webkit-and-launches-blink-its-own-rendering-engine-that-will-soon-power-chrome-and-chromeos/
[07:33:05] <GoSox> i had this "small svg" but before but it went away in my other sites
[07:33:24] <Cork> GoSox: ya, you're hitting a rendering bug
[07:33:29] <GoSox> menulizard.com used to get it bad
[07:37:11] <fade_> I'm trying to select a specific text node in an svg, how would that work?
[07:37:20] <fade_> for example if I want to select the DataField node in http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html
[07:38:01] <Cork> fade_: you would first have to get into the svg document
[07:38:27] <Cork> so $('svg').contains().find('text')
[07:54:53] <Omar-> what's the use jquery migrate js?
[07:59:10] <Cork> Omar-: it lets you use old depricated methods from pre 1.9
[07:59:31] <Cork> like .live and .toggle
[07:59:49] <Omar-> oh ok
[07:59:52] <Omar-> thanks Cork
[08:00:55] <Cork> Omar-: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/README.md
[08:04:36] <ikeshel> Do I have to discuss  a new idea to propose ... or I can work on an existing idea?
[08:06:10] <Omar-> thanks Cork :)

[08:24:58] <noob[s]TSPro> so, my problem: we are building a one pager with some parralax elements , and i slow down one element for the parallax effect, but when i scroll it keeps jumping up and down , like something is trying to put it on to its actual position(without the "slowed down" transform through scrollmagic/gsap) i even disabled all other js files for that page but it keeps occuring and im kinda helpless right now
[08:25:06] <noob[s]TSPro> it seems to be an issue with scrollmagic/gsap
[08:25:25] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example?
[08:26:23] <noob[s]TSPro> i dont know if i can reproduce it on a codepen, and i cannot share access to our testing site, which is a problem , i know
[08:26:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[08:26:47] <robertmaxrees> and you checked all your styling in the element/parent elements to make sure that's not causing any problems?
[08:27:01] <noob[s]TSPro> styling thought css?
[08:27:13] <noob[s]TSPro> or styling through scrollmagic/gsap?
[08:27:23] <robertmaxrees> through your css.
[08:27:39] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something might be set to some weird position on accident maybe.
[08:27:59] <noob[s]TSPro> could the csss interact with the transform done by scrollmagic/gsap?
[08:28:19] <robertmaxrees> why else would i suggest you look at it? ;)
[08:28:22] <noob[s]TSPro> shouldnt it just override the initial style when tweening?
[08:28:41] <noob[s]TSPro> umm. let me check it then.
[08:28:49] <robertmaxrees> it could be all sorts of things.
[08:28:57] <noob[s]TSPro> i havent done the css, as im just a trainee, and am just doing the animations
[08:29:01] <robertmaxrees> and my crystal ball is a little fuzzy ;)
[08:29:06] <noob[s]TSPro> yeah i can tell
[08:29:16] <noob[s]TSPro> im not providing good info i know and im feeling bad
[08:29:22] <noob[s]TSPro> but i cannot help it sadly =(
[08:29:48] <noob[s]TSPro> i just know that the element.style of the frame gets the transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); property
[08:30:02] <noob[s]TSPro> and switches rapidly with the transform done by scrollmagic/gsap
[08:30:23] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  you need to check the position property to make sure things aren't wonky.
[08:30:48] <noob[s]TSPro> so if position is set to relative it can cause problems?
[08:30:52] <noob[s]TSPro> mb?
[08:31:01] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what that particular setup requires.
[08:31:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm just tossing out things to check.
[08:31:11] <robertmaxrees> again, since i can
[08:31:20] <robertmaxrees> *can't see it in action, i'm telling you where I'd start.
[08:33:38] <noob[s]TSPro> ill do a screencapture
[08:33:43] <noob[s]TSPro> to show you how its looking at least
[08:33:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not really going to help me, but OK.
[08:34:11] <robertmaxrees> mayube check out http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 ?
[08:36:12] <noob[s]TSPro> okay ima check that out
[08:51:25] <dimi1947> what event is triggered when we select a check box?

[09:06:30] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can recommend a drag and drop file uploader pre-form and submits with form?
[09:22:40] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can recommend a drag and drop file uploader pre-form and submits with form?
[09:22:59] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that means?
[09:23:10] <robertmaxrees> "pre-form and submits with form" especially.
[09:28:38] <Forbidd3n> submit with form sorry for my lack of words
[09:29:20] <Forbidd3n> I need to upload on submit so when creating a new record I can assign the files to that record. Unless there is a better way to do it
[09:29:47] <robertmaxrees> so you want a drag and drop way to add a file to a form.
[09:30:49] <Forbidd3n> multiple files to form so they are uploaded with $_FILES (in php) when form is submitted
[09:32:01] <Forbidd3n> dropzone looks like it might do it, but you have to process the queue prior to submitting the form and therefore before creating the database record and retrieving the incremented id
[09:32:08] <Forbidd3n> to assign the files to
[09:32:32] <robertmaxrees> you're going to run into cross-browser problems pretty much no matter what, so I'd approach something like that and run with it.
[09:33:35] <Forbidd3n> it isn't a cross-browser issue for what I am asking I don't believe
[09:33:48] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's what you think :)

[09:51:16] <frabblerock> anyone here have experience with requirejs?

[09:55:13] <Snerf> with a jQuery slider widget, that has two sliders, in the slide event, how can I know which slider was used, i need an index of 0 or 1
[09:55:14] <psykrsna> Silly question: Does focusout of an element take precedence over the click of another element?
[09:55:33] <robertmaxrees> psykrsna not sure what you mean.  both events fire.
[09:55:52] <psykrsna> In my case the click is not firing.
[09:56:01] <robertmaxrees> psykrsna can you make a fiddle to demonstrate?
[09:56:11] <psykrsna> in 30 secs
[09:56:21] <robertmaxrees> Snerf do you have a range slider or two separate slider widgets?
[09:56:40] <Snerf> robertmaxrees, range slider
[09:57:25] <robertmaxrees> i know you can read ui.values for an array of values.
[09:58:09] <Snerf> yes, thats easy enough, I am just trying to get the actual handle, if its the 1st or second
[09:59:35] <Snerf> robertmaxrees, I have seen code that does this: var handleIndex = $(ui.handle).data('index.uiSliderHandle'); , but I am getting an undefined value with that
[10:00:06] <psykrsna> robertmaxrees, I can't enter replicate the entire logic but the essential js is here https://jsfiddle.net/vdju4ds8/
[10:00:20] <psykrsna> My console shows 'focusout' and never 'click'
[10:00:36] <atxq> hey guys, is there to detect if an object is over another, and if so, how can I move it to either side so it will not overlap each other? I am using absolute position.
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> Snerf i'd look inside the event object in the handler and see if you can't find something in there.
[10:01:06] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i don't know off the top of my head.
[10:01:46] <robertmaxrees> atxq i'd need to see the relevant markup.
[10:02:05] <robertmaxrees> because that should work just fine unless something is catching the click event and stopping its propagation.
[10:03:11] <atxq> I have a bunch of divs with random x,y coordinates on a page. Is there a way to detect if any of the divs overlap each other?
[10:04:16] <robertmaxrees> atxq you want collision detection.
[10:04:26] <atxq> yes, I guess
[10:04:56] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/4230951/923919 here's an example.

[10:07:11] <Sal> does an object var sent by ajax with datatyoe json always return as an array in php?
[10:07:38] <atxq> thanks robertmaxrees
[10:08:03] <robertmaxrees> Sal you'd have to ask in ##php i'm guessing?
[10:08:14] <Sal> i set up an object using data.code=1 and data[var]=2
[10:08:26] <Sal> is that the correct way to create a dynamic object var?
[10:08:46] <robertmaxrees> object property?  yeah.
[10:08:51] <Sal> ok
[10:08:58] <Sal> so the js part is ok
[10:09:06] <Sal> i'll go ask php now, thanks
[10:09:16] <Sal> strange thing
[10:09:17] <robertmaxrees> you probably want a JSON decoding library of some kind.
[10:09:32] <Sal> it is datatype: 'json'
[10:09:38] <Sal> in my ajax call
[10:09:43] <robertmaxrees> right, but PHP might not readily understand what that means.
[10:09:59] <Sal> but in php, i receive all vars correctly
[10:09:59] <robertmaxrees> so you probably need a JSON deserialization library to get it into a format it understands.
[10:10:15] <Sal> the only think is that i receive it as an array
[10:10:27] <robertmaxrees> an associative array?
[10:10:28] <Sal> like data["code"]
[10:10:31] <Sal> yes
[10:10:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, js objects are very similar to associative arrays.
[10:10:50] <robertmaxrees> at least in use.
[10:11:05] <Sal> yep
[10:11:13] <varrg> I'm new to jQuery, and about to write a plugin. I'm wondering about the structure of the plugin. My requirements are that you should initialize the plugin, and then apply it to HTML elements. Therefor I want to be able to initialize it with options, and then apply it to elements with the possibility to override those settings specifically to elements. I've got this sofar: http://pastie.org/private/r1ffj0l8qqmj8sogjtu4q
[10:11:24] <Sal> hard to distinguish when not using the dot syntax
[10:11:58] <robertmaxrees> varrg check out https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/
[10:12:16] <varrg> thank you
[10:12:48] <psykrsna> robertmaxrees, help. How do I make the focusout to not fire in the case the click also happens https://jsfiddle.net/vdju4ds8/
[10:13:10] <robertmaxrees> psykrsna i need a functioning example.
[10:13:34] <robertmaxrees> those are two unrelated events, so you're going to have all sorts of headaches doing what you're trying to do.
[10:14:33] <varrg> robertmaxrees, Those all uses the $.fn.foo approach, if I want to initialize it with: Foo({options...}) ?
[10:14:43] <varrg> is that: $.Foo = function(options){}
[10:15:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?  do you have a example plugin that does what you want?
[10:16:18] <decx> doesnt matter where you attach it
[10:16:27] <decx> options and defaults are done with extend
[10:16:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah something here seems off to me.
[10:17:30] <varrg> well, the user's experience should be something like: var init_plugin = MyPlugin(my_options);init_plugin.apply(my_html_element)
[10:17:45] <varrg> perhaps applying should be: init_plugin(my_html_element)
[10:18:25] <robertmaxrees> so then you don't want a plugin ;)
[10:18:37] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to extend the jquery object.
[10:18:39] <varrg> or $(my_html_element).apply_plugin(options) but that might override if some other plugin defines $.fn.apply_plugin
[10:18:54] <varrg> oh, okay. What is what I want called?
[10:19:04] <robertmaxrees> you just want to write some functions i guess.
[10:19:17] <robertmaxrees> you should strive for the latter pattern you're looking at.
[10:19:24] <robertmaxrees> $('someSelector').myPlugin();
[10:19:59] <varrg> robertmaxrees, okay, so if $().myPlugin() initializes the plugin, how would I go about applying the plugin to elements?
[10:20:29] <robertmaxrees> errr, no.  you initialize and apply in one step.
[10:20:44] <robertmaxrees> why are you obsessed with decoupling those two steps?
[10:20:52] <varrg> I don't want to do that. Since I'd need to resubmit the options object every time
[10:20:58] <psykrsna> Question: Is there a negation selector in jQuery
[10:21:10] <psykrsna> As in a way to say "When a user clicks on anything but this div"
[10:21:34] <robertmaxrees> varrg so you want to be able to set defaults?  then have the user create the defaults object and pass that each time they initialize.
[10:21:47] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty similar to what almost every other plugin does.
[10:22:27] <varrg> I see. Alright, I'll do that then. Thank you
[10:23:15] <varrg> and private properties are just variables defined outside the $.fn. function?
[10:23:30] <varrg> var private_var = true; $.fn.myplugin = function(){}
[10:23:38] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:24:03] <robertmaxrees> psykrsna you need to check if the event.target is the element or a descendent of the element in question.
[10:24:42] <psykrsna> ok thanks
[10:24:50] <_DB> sup guys
[10:25:06] <varrg> like this robertmaxrees: http://pastie.org/private/gpa4ts9zdgd08idasvpn7w
[10:25:19] <_DB> I want to create a function that unchecks all the check boxes on my page
[10:25:26] <robertmaxrees> if you need to hold some kind of state, sure?
[10:25:33] <_DB> im wondering if I should add a class , this is what one fo them looks like <input type="checkbox" name="bchk[]" id="bchk[5]" class="chk-row" value="5">
[10:25:35] <varrg> I do. okay
[10:25:53] <robertmaxrees> _DB do you need a class?
[10:26:09] <_DB> I saw this figured its the best way to do it   jQuery('.pricing-levels-2 .single-checkbox').attr('checked', false);
[10:26:17] <_DB> well If it can be done by the id
[10:26:26] <_DB> then I'll use the ID
[10:26:33] <robertmaxrees> you want .prop() for that btw.
[10:26:46] <_DB> yeah I changed it on my script
[10:26:50] <robertmaxrees> if you already have a unique ID, just use it...
[10:26:51] <_DB> the example was using attr
[10:27:08] <_DB>    $('#bchk').prop('checked', false); i did that but it didnt work
[10:27:28] <robertmaxrees> ... because the ID is bchk[5]
[10:27:34] <robertmaxrees> not bchk
[10:27:55] <_DB> aww man
[10:28:05] <_DB> so I should probably add in a class
[10:28:12] <_DB> betetr than running a foreach
[10:28:13] <robertmaxrees> why?
[10:28:25] <robertmaxrees> aaah you have multiple elements you want to select?
[10:28:40] <_DB> multiple ones I want to deselect
[10:28:57] <robertmaxrees> by "select" i mean "get with a jquery selector"
[10:28:59] <_DB> I have a tab system on my page so when they switch tabs I want to deselect all of the checked boxes
[10:29:02] <_DB> yeah
[10:29:27] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, give the pertinent ones a class.  you already have one there you should be able to use.
[10:43:45] <varrg> I need to add a delegate event to a HTML element that may already have that event bound, can I check if it exists before binding it?
[10:44:05] <varrg> or are identical events not bound?
[10:45:13] <Kheeper> hello ... I have a bootstrap dropdown menu and I'm trying to trigger to dropdown manually by query function .dropdown('toggle') it tried to do it but on the end is unsuccessful
[10:45:22] <Kheeper> can any one help?
[10:45:47] <robertmaxrees> varrg that's code smell.
[10:46:05] <robertmaxrees> identical handlers will be re-bound, so they'll fire multiple times.
[10:46:37] <robertmaxrees> Kheeper sure - have a simple fiddle?
[10:47:29] <Kheeper> can I put the code in pastern? so you can see
[10:47:44] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle is preferred so we can run it.
[10:47:45] <Kheeper> *pastebin
[10:47:48] <Kheeper> oka
[10:48:07] <varrg> robertmaxrees, how about this situation: http://pastie.org/private/5kmsici3aulloqxem5vphw
[10:48:10] <Kheeper> give me second
[10:48:20] <robertmaxrees> varrg what about it?
[10:48:31] <varrg> now, if the plugin is called twice with the same options.element, then it will have 2 identical event listeners
[10:48:56] <robertmaxrees> right.  some people add in a data attribute to see if the plugin has been initialized there before.
[10:49:19] <varrg> ah, smart, thanks
[10:53:54] <hlvwrk> what am i doing wrong. i'm slamming my head into the table here.

[10:53:58] <hlvwrk> lol
[10:54:05] <hlvwrk> it's saying the has class is positioned incorrectly
[10:54:10] <hlvwrk> am i just dumbmode today?
[10:54:26] <robertmaxrees> what's saying that?
[10:54:46] <hlvwrk> debugger
[10:54:55] <hlvwrk> er

[10:55:24] <robertmaxrees> normally http://fixee.org/paste/6b2w3wt/ is how you'd indent that but i'm not sure what that error is supposed to mean.
[10:55:46] <hlvwrk> sec.
[10:56:02] <adavia> whats a good suggestion for a file uploader?
[10:58:05] <Kheeper> robertmaxrees, ok this shoub be ok https://jsfiddle.net/vc1pyduw/ I need to trigger the message icon dropdown open by clicking on something else then the enveloper icon
[10:58:43] <robertmaxrees> so you want to open the message dropdown?
[10:58:52] <Kheeper> yes
[10:59:17] <Kheeper> by clicking on some other element
[10:59:27] <robertmaxrees> i got that part ;)
[10:59:37] <Kheeper> oka :)
[11:00:41] <Kheeper> i tried this $( '#chat-toggle a' ).dropdown ( 'toggle' );
[11:01:36] <Kheeper> while looking in to code it seem that it tried to open but the it's return in to prev state
[11:03:26] <robertmaxrees> are you sure your markup is correct btw?
[11:03:36] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vc1pyduw/1/ should work.
[11:04:40] <Kheeper> I'm not sure ...
[11:06:04] <Kheeper> ok can you show me working example not based on my code
[11:06:22] <robertmaxrees> not readily...
[11:06:23] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:06:36] <Kheeper> oka
[11:07:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vc1pyduw/2/ yeah something is up.  that should work.
[11:08:14] <Kheeper> thats what I'm trying to figure for 2 days now what is up ;)
[11:08:38] <Kheeper> I tried like tons of methods
[11:08:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check your markup at this point.
[11:09:19] <Kheeper> and?
[11:09:28] <robertmaxrees> read this? http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:09:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure what else to tell you.
[11:09:42] <robertmaxrees> if the JS is busted, your markup is probably the problem.
[11:11:50] <Impaloo> how does jQuery call submit on parent form when calling .submit() on an input?
[11:12:07] <Impaloo> i tried looking through the source code, I cant find how. does it even do that?
[11:12:16] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't.
[11:12:32] <robertmaxrees> are you just calling .submit() on an input?  or are you trying to bind to an inputs submit?
[11:12:43] <robertmaxrees> because the latter doesn't exist, and the former is because of event bubbling.
[11:13:32] <hackergeek> Binding click() to the submit button is probably better.
[11:13:37] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:13:40] <robertmaxrees> bind to the form's submit.
[11:13:53] <robertmaxrees> users can submit forms without click on the submit button.
[11:14:18] <hackergeek> That's true.  How do you bid to form's submit?
[11:14:31] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function() {});
[11:15:14] <Impaloo> robertmaxrees: is the event bubbling part a feature from jquery or the native document API?
[11:15:21] <robertmaxrees> both-ish.
[11:15:32] <robertmaxrees> jquery fixes some inconsistencies with the native DOM api.
[11:15:45] <robertmaxrees> are you triggering the submit event on an input?
[11:16:50] <Impaloo> robertmaxrees: i do .submit() on an input wrapped with jquery
[11:16:56] <Impaloo> and it subsequently submits the form
[11:17:04] <robertmaxrees> O.o yeah, don't do that.
[11:17:06] <Impaloo> i have a hard time replicating that in vanilla j
[11:17:07] <Impaloo> sjs
[11:17:11] <draconusdesigns> Quick and stupid question:
[11:17:12] <draconusdesigns> http://www.codeshare.io/42f7L
[11:17:17] <robertmaxrees> there's no such thing as a submit event for inputs.
[11:17:21] <Impaloo> yeah
[11:17:24] <Impaloo> but, how should I do it?
[11:17:27] <draconusdesigns> Line 5, it checks for a cookie that is set on 23
[11:17:30] <Impaloo> .closest('form').submit()?
[11:17:47] <robertmaxrees> Impaloo basically.  or select the form directly.
[11:17:48] <draconusdesigns> If no cookie, then fire the div off after 5 seconds of no movement.
[11:18:00] <hackergeek> OK.  Thanks!  I actually just did $('#submitBtn').click() and the function was called when I pressed enter.  I did not have to actually click the button.
[11:18:04] <Impaloo> robertmaxrees: the enclosing form is arbitrary in the context where I call input.submit()
[11:18:08] <draconusdesigns> The div keeps setting off every 5 secondslike clockwork.
[11:18:20] <Impaloo> so I think .closest would be best
[11:18:20] <robertmaxrees> hackergeek still more semantically correct to bind to the submit event.
[11:18:22] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[11:18:23] <draconusdesigns> so it is ignoring the if the coookie is set part
[11:18:37] <robertmaxrees> draconusdesigns you have a few global vars in here - is that intentional?
[11:19:12] <draconusdesigns> I thought that would be the proper scope, but now that you mention it, it may not need to be scoped like that.
[11:19:40] <hackergeek> robertmaxrees, that is true.
[11:19:41] <robertmaxrees> draconusdesigns also, this code runs once, checks the cookie, and then starts running.
[11:19:56] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't check each time.  document ready fires a single time.
[11:20:38] <draconusdesigns> Which is right. I only want this to run once.
[11:20:48] <draconusdesigns> And only if the cookie is not set.
[11:21:17] <draconusdesigns> But when I try this code, the modal pops up after five, ten, fifteen secs, etc.
[11:21:22] <draconusdesigns> so it is in fact looping.
[11:21:27] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle it then?
[11:21:30] <draconusdesigns> Which doens't make sense.
[11:21:37] <draconusdesigns> sure. I can fiddle it for you
[11:21:41] <draconusdesigns> gimme a moment

[11:26:59] <draconusdesigns> There, You can actually see the background grey flicker every five seconds when it calls the featherlight modal again and again.
[11:27:07] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:27:16] <draconusdesigns> It makes no sense, it should run just once right?
[11:27:18] <draconusdesigns> ok
[11:27:25] <robertmaxrees> actually, this does make sense.
[11:27:35] <draconusdesigns> ?
[11:27:51] <robertmaxrees> you set the interval, which runs timerIncrement.  i don't see anywhere where you then tell it to stop.
[11:28:18] <robertmaxrees> are you maybe confused about intervals vs timeouts
[11:28:36] <draconusdesigns> I am always confused with javascript.
[11:29:30] <robertmaxrees> it's not now doing anything for me.
[11:29:31] <draconusdesigns> My javascript guru is wrapped up today so I am stuck at the moment.
[11:29:37] <draconusdesigns> Right
[11:29:47] <robertmaxrees> are you meaning for that code once after 1 second?
[11:29:50] <robertmaxrees> or once every second?
[11:29:55] <draconusdesigns> the cookie eventually does read, and if the cookie is set, it won't load the modal
[11:30:45] <draconusdesigns> How it is supposed to work is, check for the cookie, if not set, and no movement of the mouse for 5 seconds, then load the modal once.
[11:30:58] <robertmaxrees> then you want a timeout, not an interval.
[11:31:41] <robertmaxrees> with a debounce, not the code you've got here.
[11:34:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Laxwz2b3/2/ is the core of what you need.
[11:34:32] <robertmaxrees> without the cookie check.
[11:34:45] <robertmaxrees> but the interval thing makes sense.  it's going to keep running always.
[11:39:20] <draconusdesigns> Yeah, which it needs to, because we wanna wait for the user to not move the mouse for 5 seconds.
[11:39:32] <draconusdesigns> And that likely won't happen on page load.
[11:39:33] <robertmaxrees> right, so you want a debounce.
[11:39:48] <draconusdesigns> I'm agreeing with you :)
[11:39:57] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:40:12] <DragonPunch> how can i get a dynamically appended div
[11:40:21] <DragonPunch> to automatically scroll down when it appends itself to the container
[11:41:33] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch select the new div, then set the window.scrollTop();
[11:41:57] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: okay, well it's a UL, that i need to scroll to the bottom to.
[11:42:03] <DragonPunch> is doing it on the ul okay?
[11:42:12] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:42:17] <robertmaxrees> any element you can do that with.
[11:46:00] <DragonPunch> 			        var objDiv = $('#chat[data-chatidbox="' + chatid + '"]').children("#chat-messages").children("#messages").children("#messages-list");
[11:46:00] <DragonPunch> 			        objDiv.scrollTop = objDiv.scrollHeight;
[11:46:02] <DragonPunch> that is what i have
[11:46:15] <DragonPunch> it doesn't work as intended
[11:46:25] <robertmaxrees> you aren't duplicating IDs are you?
[11:46:37] <robertmaxrees> also, scrollTop is a function.
[11:46:38] <DragonPunch> i am
[11:46:42] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:46:45] <robertmaxrees> that's a big problem.
[11:46:54] <DragonPunch> yeah well
[11:46:58] <robertmaxrees> you can't replicate IDs.
[11:47:05] <DragonPunch> i know idk why im doing that
[11:47:13] <DragonPunch> its becuase so many fucking shitty tutorials on the internet
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix that.
[11:47:19] <robertmaxrees> and use classes instead.
[11:47:24] <DragonPunch> i used to always use classes
[11:47:33] <DragonPunch> okay, but anyways, before i get angry at myself
[11:47:43] <robertmaxrees> no really, you need to fix the classes vs. ids thing.
[11:47:52] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll have buggy code.
[11:48:01] <robertmaxrees> also, scrollTop is a function/.
[11:48:26] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[11:49:58] <Lloople_Lab> Hi all, don't know if there's someone here to help me with a problem of jquery code execution
[11:50:11] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab just ask your question.
[11:50:23] <DragonPunch> hmm
[11:50:28] <DragonPunch> what value do i set scrollTop to
[11:50:47] <robertmaxrees> the the offset().top of the element you added I'm guessting.
[11:50:57] <Lloople_Lab> I have a button which send a form via $('#main-form').submit(); but I want to show a loading div before the form submit
[11:51:13] <robertmaxrees> is the form submitting via AJAX?
[11:51:22] <Lloople_Lab> I put a console.log inside the loading function, I see the console.log appearing instantly but the div appears after 2 seconds
[11:51:51] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, that form is special, because I make a preventdefault on .submit() event, and inside make a few AJAX requests
[11:52:07] <Lloople_Lab> and depends on the result I finally return; to send the form or put a e.preventDefault to show a warning
[11:52:41] <robertmaxrees> okay.  you probably want to look into deferred objects and go from there?
[11:52:46] <robertmaxrees> it's hard to say without seeing it.
[11:52:56] <Lloople_Lab> but the order is: I press the button, the button calls loading() function, the button submits the form, the form make the 3 ajax, and after that decided what to do
[11:53:27] <robertmaxrees> then show the loading icon immediatelky after the button press and hide it after you decide what to do?
[11:53:39] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: its not workign :(
[11:53:46] <robertmaxrees> fiddle it then.
[11:53:46] <Lloople_Lab> yes, but this is not what's happening
[11:53:52] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: is a live version okay?
[11:54:00] <robertmaxrees> eh, not generally preferred.
[11:54:06] <Lloople_Lab> the loading div / icon only appears when the form is submitted at all
[11:54:21] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab then you're not firing it at the right time.
[11:54:22] <DragonPunch> robertmaxrees: its hard to fiddle
[11:54:48] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, I'll show you in a pastebin
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch i have a hard time believing that.  you're appending something to a container and want to scroll to it when that happens?
[11:55:33] <DragonPunch> yeah
[11:55:40] <DragonPunch> its a messaging app
[11:55:42] <robertmaxrees> that's a really simple fiddle :O)
[11:56:02] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:56:05] <DragonPunch> ok
[11:56:11] <DragonPunch> :(
[11:57:57] <robertmaxrees> even simpler way do to it: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7zbbzko6/
[11:58:25] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, here's the code http://pastebin.com/U91arwNT
[11:58:31] <DragonPunch> let me try
[11:59:00] <TeddyMurray> how do you remove an event handler?
[11:59:00] <triforcej> have a semi-complicated question if there are any experts around :)
[11:59:08] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ triforcej
[11:59:09] <b-ot> triforcej: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:59:13] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray check out .off()
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab i'd need to see this in a fiddle.
[11:59:31] <TeddyMurray> thanks robertmaxrees
[11:59:48] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, but I can't put the AJAX in a fiddle
[11:59:56] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab that's fine.  we can fake that part.
[12:00:14] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, think u have more knowledge than me :O
[12:00:27] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.  good luck then.
[12:00:27] <Lloople_Lab> I'll try to make a fiddle with that
[12:00:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of ajax put in timeouts.
[12:00:43] <robertmaxrees> or something.
[12:00:47] <Lloople_Lab> okay
[12:01:00] <robertmaxrees> also: .send-form - what is that?
[12:01:34] <robertmaxrees> you should having loading(true) as the first line of that submit handler.
[12:01:44] <robertmaxrees> and ditch that click handler.
[12:02:13] <Kheeper> robertmaxrees, just heads up http://jsfiddle.net/7jkNc/
[12:02:59] <triforcej> I'm having some difficulty loading specific tabs remotely. http://173.247.242.108/~fnbleb5/elec-consumer : On this page, I used Jquery Tabs and everything works, but when I link to it with anchors - it doesn't find the page. (ex. http://173.247.242.108/~fnbleb5/elec-consumer#tabs3     I think it has something to do with how things are loaded within our sites template but was wondering if anyone
[12:02:59] <triforcej> had any ideas.
[12:03:30] <robertmaxrees> Kheeper interesting.
[12:03:58] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, .send-form is a class for the button which sends the form
[12:04:06] <Kheeper> robertmaxrees, tel me about it
[12:04:14] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab you want to put your code in the submit handler for the form.
[12:04:19] <robertmaxrees> not the click event listener for a button.
[12:04:41] <robertmaxrees> triforcej http://173.247.242.108/~fnbleb5/tabs3 gives me a 404
[12:04:42] <Lloople_Lab> I tried too
[12:05:21] <Kheeper> robertmaxrees, anyway thank's or time ... finally is working
[12:05:27] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[12:05:53] <triforcej> That's my issue. http://173.247.242.108/~fnbleb5/elec-consumer works, but when you try to go to a link with anchors, it 404's.
[12:06:06] <triforcej> like http://173.247.242.108/~fnbleb5/elec-consumer#tabs3
[12:06:21] <robertmaxrees> you mean with hashes.
[12:06:29] <triforcej> sorry yes
[12:06:38] <robertmaxrees> and that's because for some reason your JS is trying to redirect me to another URL.
[12:07:35] <pyemkey> Hello peeps. I'm not sure is it right channel to ask the question about bootstrap-select. I have strange problem with this plugin. It's all about custom select with live search. Let's say I have two dropdowns. When I open first dropdown and if this one is enough long what makes some cover over another I cannot select option. I'm not sure about my explanation. I've prepared screenshot how it looks like http://cl.ly/imag
[12:07:36] <pyemkey> e/152F0U10191j It's my first time here and I have to say sorry for my english skills, but its not my mother tongue. I hope someone can help me with my problem. I also provide link for the plugin http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/
[12:08:06] <triforcej> we use a template ( bought before i started )...  which loads pages with js and ajax. in your opinion, would I need to get into the template to modify that or is there some workaround I can use with jquery?
[12:08:41] <robertmaxrees> triforcej i have no clue - i'm not going to dumb through your template.  you need to look at what's redirecting the end user.  start pulling things out and see what that might be.
[12:08:42] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, http://websitevf.info/contact-velocify/ im using $("body").off("submit","#contacform",function(){alert('test');}); but it still is triggering the javascript event handler
[12:09:18] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray because that's not the right way to use that ;) try just $('body').off('submit', '#contactform') for starters
[12:09:25] <triforcej> ok thanks
[12:09:28] <TeddyMurray> ty sir
[12:10:13] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, same error
[12:10:27] * robertmaxrees looks into crystal ball
[12:10:29] <TeddyMurray> lol
[12:10:34] <robertmaxrees> can't see your code.  hrmmm....
[12:10:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:10:52] <robertmaxrees> did you actually READ the documentation?
[12:10:55] <TeddyMurray> i sent you a link :( the Send button
[12:11:06] <TeddyMurray> yes, ill read it again
[12:12:53] <TeddyMurray> hmm, maybe because the event isn't being set by jquery?
[12:13:37] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, this is the code but it's not working for now :( http://jsfiddle.net/kaegzubg/
[12:13:50] <Lloople_Lab> I mean, I don't even seen the animation when I will see it
[12:13:56] <Lloople_Lab> should see it
[12:13:58] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray is it set natively?
[12:14:10] <TeddyMurray> im not sure, its a wordpress plugin so im avoiding opening it up
[12:14:27] <TeddyMurray> its setting every form on the page to an event handler somehow
[12:15:13] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab fwiw you don't need to return out of every handler.
[12:15:26] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, what do you mean?
[12:15:43] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, now the animation is working http://jsfiddle.net/kaegzubg/2/
[12:15:46] <robertmaxrees> you keep returning empty object.
[12:15:50] <Lloople_Lab> but here's not the delay I have in my application
[12:15:51] <robertmaxrees> totally unnecessary.
[12:16:25] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, sorry I don't got you :(
[12:16:37] <robertmaxrees> return; //submit the form
[12:16:40] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing that?
[12:16:49] <Lloople_Lab> to send the form if all the ajax are ok
[12:17:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kaegzubg/3/ do somehting like this instead.
[12:17:47] <robertmaxrees> and in your latest example, you don't ever turn the animation off.
[12:17:56] <Lloople_Lab> yes, just for testing
[12:18:00] <Lloople_Lab> beause I don't have the timer
[12:18:03] <robertmaxrees> so it's working fine then?
[12:18:06] <Lloople_Lab> and the animation will come and go so quickly
[12:18:19] <Lloople_Lab> in the fiddle yes, in my application no
[12:18:35] <Lloople_Lab> I click the button, the console.log inside loading() appears instantly and waits 2 secs to show the animation
[12:19:05] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kaegzubg/4/
[12:19:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to put everything in the submit handler instead of the click handler.
[12:19:46] <gustav> Hi. Can I ask about jquery.validate?
[12:20:05] <robertmaxrees> gustav you can ask, but we might not have an answer :)
[12:20:12] <gustav> Ok. :)
[12:21:40] <gustav> Ok. I'm initializing jquery.validate in $(body).ready(...) and I get a beautiful error message handler. But it doesn't handle fields that are email. To do that I have to initialize with $("#form").ready(...) and then I get the boring error handler. How can I get the pretty one?
[12:21:54] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ready()
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> not body ready
[12:21:59] <gustav> Oh.
[12:22:34] <gustav> That gives the ugly handler.
[12:22:44] <robertmaxrees> make sure your code is valid, also.
[12:22:48] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, already have all the code in submit handler, but same result, I'll try to create a gif to show you the behavior
[12:22:51] <gustav> When I do $(body) it's even in the right language.
[12:22:52] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like your markup might be busted.
[12:23:00] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab gifs aren't helpful, but OK.
[12:23:05] <robertmaxrees> gustav then your markup is invalid.
[12:23:15] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, what you suggest?
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab do you have a live version?
[12:23:37] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, no :(
[12:23:46] <kiwip> Hello everybody can i ask a question
[12:23:51] <robertmaxrees> show me your current code then, Lloople_Lab
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> kiwip of course :)
[12:24:05] <kiwip> okay thank you robertmaxrees
[12:24:19] <Lloople_Lab> it's just to show you that when I click, the console.log appears instantly, then appears an AJAX warning syncrhonous, and 2 seconds after that appears the animation
[12:24:29] <robertmaxrees> wait
[12:24:36] <robertmaxrees> you're getting a synchronous ajax warning?
[12:24:43] <Lloople_Lab> yes
[12:24:45] <Lloople_Lab> I'll paste here
[12:24:45] <gustav> robertmaxrees: I think my markup is ok and what I call ugly is how it should look. Not sure why I get the pretty version.
[12:24:47] <robertmaxrees> did you turn async off?
[12:24:47] <kiwip> I'm a google summer of code student and can't get qunitjs.com local setup right.
[12:25:03] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
[12:25:06] <robertmaxrees> gustav i'd have to see it.
[12:25:16] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab right - did you turn async off in an ajax request?
[12:25:17] <Lloople_Lab> yes, I turned it off, because I need it off to check every request
[12:25:25] <Impaloo> kiwip: cool story bro
[12:25:30] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab that's your problem.
[12:25:30] <kiwip> (Who will be my mentor for the qunit apps?)
[12:25:34] <Lloople_Lab> :(
[12:25:39] <gustav> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/0jYQLHDd
[12:25:39] <Lloople_Lab> it has solution, doctor?
[12:25:40] <robertmaxrees> kiwip go to #jquery-dev for that.
[12:25:41] <arthurvr> kiwip: Hey! I'm a team member and would love to help you out. Can we head over to #jquery-content?
[12:25:50] <robertmaxrees> hah, ignore me, listen to arthurvr :)
[12:26:01] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab use ajax the right way, with callback.
[12:26:08] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: :D
[12:26:24] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, I'll paste my ajax in the fiddle, but it will not work for now
[12:26:25] <kiwip> Thank you all. Will chat with you arthurvr. See you there
[12:26:36] <robertmaxrees> Lloople_Lab no need to show me any more.
[12:26:37] <kiwip> Also thanks robertmaxrees of course
[12:26:41] <robertmaxrees> just use the proper callbacks :)
[12:26:49] <Lloople_Lab> you mean .done()?
[12:26:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[12:26:55] <Lloople_Lab> I'm using
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> then turn async back on
[12:27:10] <robertmaxrees> that's what's causing your problems,.
[12:27:26] <Lloople_Lab> yeah but I need it off, to check every ajax request, because it's 3 or 4
[12:27:36] <robertmaxrees> you need to refactor your code then.
[12:27:39] <Lloople_Lab> or maybe I can create new unique ajax to check the 3 or 4 parameters
[12:27:40] <robertmaxrees> becuase that's not the right way to do that
[12:27:50] <kiwip> Oh guys I had an actual support question as well. Therefor I can ask here right?
[12:27:51] <robertmaxrees> turning async off freezes the browser, causing these issues.
[12:27:57] <Lloople_Lab> ah...
[12:28:02] <Lloople_Lab> robertmaxrees, thanks master
[12:28:32] <kiwip> Shall I submit a jsfiddle? Sorry first time I hang here.
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> kiwip what's the question?
[12:29:06] <kiwip> Something that doesn't work about jQuery
[12:29:22] <robertmaxrees> gustav i'm not sure what you mean by "pretty version"
[12:29:38] <robertmaxrees> code works fine here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/voze546q/ gustav
[12:29:42] <robertmaxrees> kiwip just ask your question :)
[12:30:07] <gustav> robertmaxrees: Change $(document) to $(body)
[12:30:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:30:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/voze546q/2/
[12:30:54] <gustav> The input boxes get a red tint and there's a floating error message == pretty.
[12:31:03] <robertmaxrees> that's your browser's built-in error handling.
[12:31:08] <gustav> But it doesn't get the rules.
[12:31:11] <gustav> Uh, okay.
[12:31:21] <robertmaxrees> doing $(body).ready() was breaking the JS, making it not run at all.
[12:31:23] <djQuery> does .removeProp not work if multiple items were returned/
[12:31:25] <djQuery> ?
[12:31:29] <gustav> Hm, ok.
[12:31:39] <gustav> Thanks, now I know.
[12:31:53] <robertmaxrees> djQuery https://api.jquery.com/removeProp/ "Remove a property for the set of matched elements."
[12:32:30] <kiwip> Can I change <h1>title</h1> to <h3>title</h3> using jQuery?
[12:32:39] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:33:27] <djQuery> robertmaxrees, http://jsbin.com/zateki/1/edit
[12:34:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/qapixiyojo/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:34:35] <djQuery> robertmaxrees, notice still cannot be submited
[12:34:46] <robertmaxrees> disable the required attribute instead.
[12:35:22] <djQuery> robertmaxrees, well not what I was looking for but works good enough
[12:35:37] <djQuery> thanks
[12:35:45] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking to disable the required attribute, it's exactly what you're looking for ;)
[12:35:52] <kiwip> Ah found it
[12:35:56] <kiwip> http://jsfiddle.net/rcayr3xo/ this works
[12:36:17] <robertmaxrees> kiwip a few different ways to do that.
[12:36:52] <user_corrupt> I have a smallint(1) column set to auto-increment, and I am trying to use the follwing jQuery/PHP script to enter some dummy values into a DB: http://pastie.org/10050733 my problem is that instead of getting a "1" as the first entry I get the number "32767" and the script fails to sumbit any more entires after the first one.
[12:37:01] <arthurvr> kiwip: You’re not changing the closing tag this way.
[12:37:28] <kiwip> ok
[12:37:38] <kiwip> you are all awesome you know that
[12:38:04] <robertmaxrees> kiwip http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rcayr3xo/1/ try something like this instead.
[12:38:29] <kiwip> Yeah that seems like better thanks
[12:39:15] <kiwip> robertmaxrees: should jquery variables always be declared in global scope or is that just a personal opinion?
[12:39:28] <robertmaxrees> they should never be declared in global scope.
[12:39:53] <kiwip> wait that's what you're doing right
[12:40:04] * kiwip is confused
[12:40:29] <robertmaxrees> for that example, yes.  normally that'd be inside of an IIFE or a doc ready with a var keyword in front of it.
[12:40:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rcayr3xo/2/ like this.
[12:40:47] <kiwip> okay I understand. Thanks you all
[12:40:51] <robertmaxrees> the lack of a var keyword was a mistake.
[12:41:21] <kiwip> Thanks you
[12:46:20] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: Thanks for redirecting gsoc students :) You’ve got to deal with many already?
[12:46:32] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: It’s kind of weird they come ask stuff here.
[12:47:21] <robertmaxrees> nah, it's the channel named for the project.
[12:47:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm surprised we don't get more to be honest.
[12:47:51] <robertmaxrees> they just don't know where else to go.
[12:49:24] <arthurvr> It’s the first paragraph in our gsoc page :/
[12:49:43] <robertmaxrees> heh, people don't read as much as you'd think they do.
[12:49:57] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: Yeah, anyways, thanks for catching them
[12:50:02] <robertmaxrees> for sure.
[12:50:07] <robertmaxrees> glad to do it.

[12:59:01] <djQuery> is there no new Date().toLocalDateTimeString?
[12:59:51] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date there are all the avaialble methods.
[13:11:21] <djQuery> grrr how to fill in datetime-local with current date and time?
[13:11:27] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/keyuto/1/edit
[13:13:06] <robertmaxrees> check out the getter methods or just use moment.js
[13:16:52] <djQuery> this one should be working http://jsbin.com/keyuto/1/edit but no val populated
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> $('#dt').val(d.toLocaleString());
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> not Date
[13:21:19] <djQuery>  robertLunch thanks
[13:21:41] <djQuery> but it still doesnt populate
[13:27:58] <djQuery> it might be a chrome bug
[13:33:38] <tasaif> djQuery: have you tried giving them viagra?
[13:33:52] <tasaif> http://badum.tiss.jpg.to
[13:38:29] <djQuery> http://encosia.com/setting-the-value-of-a-datetime-local-input-with-javascript/
[13:58:39] <crantron> is there a more glamorous way of writing parent().parent() ?
[13:59:06] <sacho> .closest
[13:59:21] <tasaif> .closest(selector)
[13:59:30] <crantron> was just gunna write that, thank you
[14:00:01] <tasaif> http://no.problem.jpg.to
[14:00:17] <crantron> lol.
[14:00:41] <tasaif> http://crantron.jpg.to
[14:00:41] <crantron> parent().parent().find('td.prod-name'); would be replaced with .closet('td.prod-name')
[14:00:59] <crantron> duh fuck...

[14:03:09] <crantron> feeling*
[14:03:23] <tasaif> How do I get the file name from the done callback?
[14:03:33] <tasaif> $(this).val() yields nothing
[14:03:38] <tasaif> this.files yields nothing

[14:57:26] <robertmaxrees> yo
[15:36:17] <wytrzeszcz> hi
[15:36:26] <robertmaxrees> yo
[15:37:02] <wytrzeszcz> for question about GSOC here?
[15:37:14] <robertmaxrees> you want #jquery-dev
[15:38:01] <wytrzeszcz> thanks
[15:52:10] <rockobee> Trying to get the first part of a menu to load automatically when my page loads.  I've got the basic structure recreated here: http://codepen.io/fatiherikli/pen/lHpfE  anyone have any suggestions?
[15:54:29] <grodt> sup rockobee
[15:55:54] <rockobee> hia
[15:59:46] <grodt> rockobee, sup n*gga?
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[15:59:51] <robertmaxrees> not OK.
[16:00:42] <tasaif> rockobee: maybe something like $('#cbp-hrmenu li:first').click()
[16:01:32] <rockobee> thanks tasaif i'll give it a try
[16:02:46] <tasaif> np
[16:03:18] <tasaif> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBUJCCja4u4
[16:03:29] <robertmaxrees> hey, so let's not do that here.
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> cool?
[16:03:43] <ISmithers> Does anyone have a way to get the width of a hidden element?
[16:04:00] <tasaif> sure
[16:08:54] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: did you know that episode was based on a real thing that happened in Arizona
[16:09:06] <robertmaxrees> sure was.
[16:09:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd really rather we not discuss it here ;)
[16:09:44] <tasaif> mum's the word
[16:11:04] <tasaif> ISmithers: you could change its visibility
[16:11:14] <tasaif> display: inline-block or something
[16:11:20] <tasaif> but with visibility set to none
[16:11:28] <tasaif> then position it off screeen
[16:12:33] <ISmithers> Yeah this is the solution I'm considering atm.
[16:15:10] <compact> hi, I'm looking for a way to add up all the numbers when the input id is cheap
[16:15:11] <compact> any idea?
[16:15:23] <robertmaxrees> "when the input id is cheap"?
[16:16:08] <compact> chep*
[16:16:10] <ISmithers> Yeah what does that mean?
[16:16:12] <compact> "chep"
[16:16:18] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ compact
[16:16:18] <b-ot> compact: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:16:20] <compact> so input id="chep"
[16:16:32] <robertmaxrees> okay.  add up all what numbers?
[16:17:03] <compact> list of inputs, where i will enter numbers into the inputs
[16:17:21] <tasaif> ISmithers: http://jsfiddle.net/9jtuv7vw/1/
[16:17:26] <robertmaxrees> you can $.map().get() and then .reduce() the resulting array
[16:18:35] <ISmithers> Thanks tasaif, I understand how to do it, I just feel a bit dirty hiding things offscreen is all. But perhaps its the norm?
[16:18:45] <robertmaxrees> pretty much, ISmithers
[16:18:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the element doesn't have a height/width.
[16:18:57] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do?
[16:20:16] <ISmithers> robertmaxrees: I have a menu system which I am adjusting so that when elements are larger than the screen width, I create an ellipsis dropdown menu and add them to it. When the screen width grows again (say from ipad portrait to landscape) I remove them from the mini-list and add them back to the main menu.
[16:20:26] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:20:29] <ISmithers> But that latter part relies on getting their width to test if there is sufficient room.
[16:21:05] <ISmithers> But yeah, I can modify this so that the menu when closed has all its children hidden offscreen, and just toggle the left css rule between 0 and 9999px say.
[16:21:53] <robertmaxrees> compact http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1omqzzy5/ this makes some assumptions, but you should get the idea.
[16:25:13] <tasaif> you beat me to the punch
[16:25:13] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/8cv9p461/1/
[16:25:20] <tasaif> compact: also for you ^
[16:44:40] <rn10950> I am having an issue with .click. I can't get it to work on a div with a class and children. here is a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/52b2r47j/4/ how do I fix this?
[16:45:17] <tasaif> what do you want it to do?
[16:48:01] <neutralnet> Can I use $.ajax to send a response to the client's POST request?
[16:48:10] <rn10950> I want to get the id of the parent element when a user clicks on a div with a class of .win_titlebar. It wouldn't work so I changed the function to another element n the page to test it and it worked flawlessly
[16:49:03] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 that first function should be $(".win_titlebar").click(function() {
[16:49:07] <robertmaxrees> you're missing the perioed.
[16:49:09] <robertmaxrees> *period
[16:49:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/52b2r47j/5/
[16:49:40] <robertmaxrees> neurtr not sure what you mean.
[16:49:48] <robertmaxrees> neutralnet i mean
[16:49:58] <tasaif> neutralnet: is this some kind of nodejs stuff?
[16:50:21] <neutralnet> tasaif: oh, yeah sorry, im using node.js + express
[16:51:03] <tasaif> have you tried #node.js
[16:51:24] <tasaif> but theoretically no
[16:51:41] <tasaif> ajax does a web request to a server
[16:51:50] <tasaif> which is listening on port 80
[16:52:01] <rn10950> robertmaxrees: I was missing the period in jsfiddle not my actual function. the weird thing is if I add the period in jsfiddle it works but it does not in my local file
[16:52:05] <tasaif> unless nodejs does some crazy stuff, I don't see this working
[16:52:28] <robertmaxrees> tasaif ajax can do any URI, so the port is 80 but only if you don't specify ;)
[16:52:36] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 then something else is up.
[16:53:22] <tasaif> right, but the point is that the server is listening on a port, and browsers don't listen (yet)
[16:53:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd back up and say "why would you use $.ajax() server-side anyway?"
[16:53:57] <rn10950> robertmmaxrees: I can copy my entire page and JS into jsfiddle if that will help?
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 not really.  giving me just enough to see the bug will.
[16:54:39] <tasaif> http://wall.of.text.jpg.to/
[16:55:17] <rn10950> does the fact that i'm inserting the parent div into the DOM through a jquery function matter?
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> if the content doesn't existy on pageload, yes.
[16:55:42] <rn10950> then that's the issue
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> you can only bind to things that exist at the time of binding.  check out the delegated syntax for .on()
[16:56:40] <tasaif> $(el).on(container_selector, child_selector, callback)
[16:56:45] <neutralnet> robertmaxrees: How else would I send a respond from the server?
[16:57:03] <robertmaxrees> neutralnet express probably sets that up for you?  ask in #Node.js
[16:57:14] <robertmaxrees> tasaif that's not right.
[16:57:21] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[16:57:33] <rn10950> I have a function on my page that generates a "window" when a user requests it, usually through a onclick. Then when a user clicks on the "titlebar" I want the "window switch" function to execute.
[16:57:34] <tasaif> very good
[16:57:37] <tasaif> I was just testing you
[16:57:56] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 you want the delegated syntax for .on()
[16:58:11] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events has some goof info.
[16:58:12] <rockobee> hey tasaif i got my click thingy working, thanks again for the help
[16:58:13] <robertmaxrees> *good
[16:58:17] <rn10950> thank you
[16:58:29] <tasaif> cool no worries
[16:58:55] <rn10950> I am planning on open sourcing what I'm working on eventually if you're interested
[16:59:03] <robertmaxrees> cool
[16:59:34] <rn10950> It's a Windows 95 HTML5 emulator just in time for the 20th anniversary
[17:00:29] <tasaif> emulator?
[17:00:43] <robertmaxrees> i've seen some stuff like that.  it's pretty interesting.
[17:01:18] <tasaif> surely you mean you're emulating the desktop environment?
[17:01:31] <robertmaxrees> no need to be overly pedantic ;)
[17:01:39] <rn10950> Well, not really. "emulator" as in a UI "emulator" what I am also going for is a way to create HTML5 "applications" you can run in "windows" what are really just iframes
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah you're trying to recreate the look and feel on Win95
[17:02:02] <robertmaxrees> *of Win95
[17:02:05] <tasaif> if it was a Windows 95 emulator, I would be able to play Dark Forces on it
[17:02:50] <rn10950> Yep. and maybe even a FxOS desktop enviornment port. In that case, I can integrate it with WINE and then you can play Dark Forces :-)
[17:02:53] <tasaif> rn10950: include this in your project so I can use it to play Dark Forces
[17:02:53] <tasaif> http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsdosbox/
[17:04:13] <rn10950> I will take a look at it. My goal is to have it up on GitHub in a few weeks for contributors when it's somewhat working and then "complete" by August of 2015 for a big release for the 20th anniversary
[17:05:48] <tasaif> sounds cool
[17:06:11] <tasaif> good luck
[17:06:20] <rn10950> Currently it only works good in Firefox/Gecko but when I get it working more, I will try it in Chrome and other WebKit browsers. MSIE I don't have the capability to test as I am still using Windows 2003
[17:06:34] <robertmaxrees> fwiw chrome isn't webkit any more.
[17:06:50] <robertmaxrees> and if you can run virtualbox you can test in IE
[17:07:27] <rn10950> really? I stopped using it after the Snowden revelations and only opened it to test occasionally. By that point Firefox was faster or getting there on my PC than Chrome was
[17:07:48] <robertmaxrees> chrome is Blink!, which is a webkit fork.
[17:09:23] <rn10950> robertmaxrees: I currently have the Win10 TP in a VirtualBox VM under XP/2003. I just don't like anything after XP/2003 so I have a powerful (i3, 4GB RAM) 64-bit XP laptop.
[17:09:44] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: so that thing about treating xml like html doesn't work on safari
[17:09:59] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 i was the same way and then switched to 7 and haven't looked back.
[17:10:20] <robertmaxrees> tasaif oh safari.  the special snowflake.
[17:11:06] <rn10950> I have tried 7 and I just can't get used to the new Taskbar (even in small icons/show labels) and the horrible library-ified explorer. At least in XP you can turn the search dog off...
[17:11:08] <tasaif> yea, it worked in chrome and firefox perfectly
[17:11:25] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 i haven't had any issues with any of that.
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> in day-to-day use, it's fine.
[17:11:37] <robertmaxrees> hell, i rarely open the explorer any more anyway.
[17:11:50] <rn10950> what do you use then?
[17:12:16] <robertmaxrees> nothing.  i mostly interact with files through other applications.
[17:12:27] <robertmaxrees> sublime text, intellij, etc.
[17:12:50] <rn10950> oh ok. But i'm pretty sure we can both agree that Win 8 sucks though.
[17:13:03] <robertmaxrees> win8 is great except for some misgivings about its UX.
[17:13:17] <robertmaxrees> the underlying OS is fantastic.  metro was a poor choice for non-touch systems.
[17:14:26] <rn10950> I completely agree about that. Hell, if MS were to ever marry the XP/2000 UX with the 8 kernel, I will be like one of those Apple nuts camping in front of the store waiting to buy it
[17:14:49] <robertmaxrees> i actually dislike the xp/2k UX these days.  but that's just me.
[17:14:58] <tasaif> heathen
[17:15:00] <robertmaxrees> but i was the same way for the longest time.
[17:15:14] <rn10950> I just can't let it go. I tried, I really did, but I just can't
[17:15:27] <robertmaxrees> that i needed to be in explorer so much was symptomatic that there were other flaws in the OS.
[17:25:27] <grill> yo. how do I get an input element by its id?
[17:26:00] <robertmaxrees> $('#theId')
[17:26:02] <grill> $('input[id="long-query"]'); does not seem to be working
[17:26:27] <robertmaxrees> $('#long-query'); should be all you need.
[17:26:40] <tasaif> robertmaxrees it's something to do with it being an xml document
[17:27:00] <grill> ok. i'll give it a shot
[17:27:05] <robertmaxrees> tasaif https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/ might be worth poking?
[17:27:13] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:27:37] <tasaif> this is the sample I was just making to demo the issue
[17:27:37] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/vyxykeoq/1/
[17:27:41] <tasaif> taking a look now
[17:27:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to poke on the googles to figure it out.
[17:28:01] <tasaif> no worries
[17:28:06] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i don't have safari soooo
[17:28:18] <tasaif> I figured
[17:32:49] <rn10950> I have Safari 5 for Windows
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:33:01] <robertmaxrees> i had that installed at one point.
[17:33:05] <robertmaxrees> totally useless at this point.
[17:33:06] <rn10950> didn't remove it yet
[17:33:46] <rn10950> but keep it around because people I know insist on Safari so I need it to test
[17:34:01] <robertmaxrees> except 5 is so old it's not really relevant.
[17:34:10] <rn10950> no their mac is still on 5
[17:34:12] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:34:19] <robertmaxrees> even we don
[17:34:26] <robertmaxrees> *we don't support it.
[17:34:56] <tasaif> ok
[17:35:03] <tasaif> so I found a crossplatform solution
[17:35:09] <tasaif> it's gnarly but it works
[17:35:23] <tasaif> basically change the xml document into a string, then turn that into a jquery object
[17:35:35] <robertmaxrees> heh, that'll do it i guess.
[17:35:39] <rn10950> yes the IT dept at the school doesn't keep safari up to date. But Firefox is so I'm OK. But lots of people would rather use a 5 year old browser than a 2 month one because it has the Apple name on it
[17:36:11] <ProofTechnique> What version of OS X even runs Safari 5, anymore? That feels like ages ago
[17:36:18] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[17:36:23] <ProofTechnique> 5 years
[17:36:25] <ProofTechnique> Yeesh
[17:36:47] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 are these safari users on windows?
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> because i'd force 'em all off at that point.
[17:37:40] <ProofTechnique> Sounds like they're on OS X. <rn10950> no their mac is still on 5
[17:37:54] <robertmaxrees> that's really scary.
[17:38:08] <robertmaxrees> and my point still stands - i'd make them all change.
[17:38:31] <rn10950> They are still on Snow Leopard but from what I hear it's their XP so I'm more content using it than Yosemite. They are mac users. The funny thing is they are searching on YouTube or Google Images and they get the old IE6 version, while I am using Fx 30ish and getting a 10x speed increase and modern web support
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'
[17:39:11] <robertmaxrees> *i'd have your IT department consider pushing people off.  otherwise you're dealing with tons of unnecessary headaches.
[17:39:23] <ProofTechnique> That's a huge security hole, too
[17:39:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:39:33] <robertmaxrees> we'd never be able to get away with that here.
[17:39:47] <ProofTechnique> 5 -> 6 alone had 121 security updates.
[17:40:07] <rn10950> no they are the ones trying to convince the students to use safari. The IT dept is a huge joke there. I am a HS student and I think I know more than the IT director.
[17:40:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds systematic.
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> then again, you're still on XP soooo ;)
[17:40:43] <rn10950> I call it iSheep brainwashing.
[17:40:56] <rn10950> but I run Firefox nightly on XP
[17:40:57] <ProofTechnique> I think it's just old-fashioned bureaucracy
[17:41:11] <ProofTechnique> It's why everyone in corporate still demands I support back to IE7, at least
[17:41:18] <ProofTechnique> And XP, no less
[17:41:30] <ProofTechnique> You definitely shouldn't be running XP, anymore
[17:41:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, XP itself is full of problems still.
[17:41:55] <ProofTechnique> Not to mention it was EOL'd
[17:42:03] <robertmaxrees> finally/
[17:42:52] <ProofTechnique> Sounds like the whole place is a security nightmare
[17:42:55] <ProofTechnique> Hahaha
[17:43:05] <rn10950> this is a high school with no internal stuff. Believe me, I would not touch IE6 with a 40ft pole. But, I have a registry hack to allow me to recieve security updates till 2019
[17:43:19] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[17:43:23] <robertmaxrees> you're apart of the problem fwiw.
[17:43:48] <ProofTechnique> That sounds like a terrible thing
[17:43:57] <robertmaxrees> i know what that hack is and it's prolonging the issue.
[17:44:01] <rn10950> I kind of am, but again, I use cutting edge browsers and not IE6
[17:44:10] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter when the OS itself is that old.
[17:44:10] <ProofTechnique> Your browser is not the issue with that hack
[17:44:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd really consider making the switch.
[17:44:28] <rn10950> Oh, and I also have the Win2k UUrollup :-)
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> meh
[17:45:17] <ProofTechnique> How is all that nonsense easier than just updating your OS?
[17:45:29] <ProofTechnique> No one even charges for OS updates, anymore.
[17:45:30] <robertmaxrees> it's not - people stay attached to that UX.
[17:46:42] <ProofTechnique> Then switch to Ubuntu, hahaha
[17:47:20] <rn10950> Again, I have tried many times but I just can't get used to the workflow of Vista and up. I honestly prefer the UX of XP/2K and I will try as hard as I can to continue using it. I am not stupid, and I have AV software and a pretty lengthy hosts file, ABP, Policeman, NoScript and HTTPS everywhere.
[17:47:38] <robertmaxrees> i resisted switching for years and then finally made the change and wound up being really glad i did.  some things took some getting used to but now i actually prefer the way 7 handles things.
[17:48:12] <ProofTechnique> Yup
[17:48:28] <robertmaxrees> rn10950 the issue is that you're being reactive instead of proactive.  i give people like you a hard time because you think you're different or somehow exempt from what i'm saying.
[17:48:35] <ProofTechnique> Though, full disclosure, I really only use OS X except for compatibility testing.
[17:49:22] <robertmaxrees> at the end of the day, you're another user that we have to consider with a special edgecase scenario.  you could just make the change and tweak things to your liking.
[17:49:25] <ProofTechnique> rn10950: Also, learn the new stuff while you're still young enough for it to be fast. New technologies take longer to acclimate to as you age.
[17:49:45] <ProofTechnique> And W7 is hardly "new stuff", at this point
[17:49:52] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[17:50:13] <robertmaxrees> also: i don't touch the whole "library" setup that they push you for and hardly ever have problems.
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's just me.  and with that i go home.  enjoy folks.
[17:50:45] <ProofTechnique> I guess you could become one of the six people who can use W8 and make a mint in support calls :D
[17:51:52] <rn10950> I have tried Ubuntu and I am not a huge fan of it. I don't really like OSX, but to be fair I have only used it in a high security environment where even right click is disabled. And yes, I have used Win7 for a few years but went back to XP because even after a few years, I still hated it. Libraries being one of the things I want to have a painful death
[17:52:55] <ProofTechnique> Right click disabled?
[17:53:06] <ProofTechnique> I think someone just didn't have their preferences set correctly.
[17:53:47] <tasaif> I guess this is what try and catch are for
[17:54:02] <rn10950> no they disabled the settings snap in for "mouse"
[17:54:23] <rn10950> If I bring in a regular USB mouse it works though
[17:56:21] <tasaif> you shouldn't be using windows xp
[17:56:30] <rn10950> This is in OSX
[17:56:37] <ProofTechnique> So by high security you mean that you had to enter a password to change system preferences. :|
[17:56:55] <ProofTechnique> But seriously, you shouldn't be using XP
[17:57:51] <rn10950> Kind of, in the mac version of Control Panel the mouse setting to change the settings to the smart mouse to enable right click is grayed out.
[17:57:51] <ProofTechnique> Also, doesn't that registry hack only last until the Server 2003 EOL?
[17:59:19] <rn10950> And XP is a guilty pleasure. I know I shouldn't be using it but I still do. At this point in time, the latest versions of all the programs that I use are compatible with it, and when that changes, I will reconsider.
[17:59:44] <ProofTechnique> Well, your update magic is gonna run out in July, so...
[17:59:48] <tasaif> how do you handle security?
[17:59:55] <rn10950> No until the EOL of POSReady 2009, which is 2019.
[18:00:26] <rn10950> It's based off of NT 5.1 so it works pretty damn well for regular XP systems
[18:00:41] <ProofTechnique> tasaif: Poorly, it seems like.
[18:00:51] <tasaif> http://badum.tiss.jpg.to
[18:30:17] <ugoub> Try this: $('[id$=tableSearch]').find('.DataTable *); What if i want to select the reverse descendant? is there a gentle solution?
[18:31:03] <ProofTechnique> The parent?
[18:31:27] <ProofTechnique> https://api.jquery.com/parent/
[18:31:30] <ugoub> It sames $('[id$=tableSearch]').find(':not(DataTable *)'); is a good way to express .but if this is also .DataTable it won't be.
[18:32:07] <ugoub> no parent or parents.
[18:32:20] <ProofTechnique> Can you put an example on JSFiddle?
[18:32:40] <ugoub> Let make it simple:$this = $('[id$=tableSearch]');
[18:33:21] <ProofTechnique> Okay. And?
[18:33:41] <DragonPunch> okay so i have a div that's being appended dynamically 'onclick' via ajax. i have a jquery custom scrollbar plugin that if i put .content on a div that it will make that div scroll with a sexy scrollbar. however it doesn't work when i dynamically add divs
[18:33:42] <DragonPunch> anyone?
[18:34:03] <ugoub> I want find $this 's descendant. which is not $this.find(.DataTable)'s descendant.unluckly $this.is('.DataTable')==true;
[18:34:17] <ProofTechnique> DragonPunch: You probably need to reload the plugin after you add the div.
[18:34:29] <DragonPunch> ProofTechnique: how is that passible
[18:35:08] <ProofTechnique> DragonPunch: Either don't initialize it until the click event, or check if it has a method to reinitialize and put that in the click
[18:36:51] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: So you want it to find elements such that [id$tableSearch] > :not(.DataTable)?
[18:37:23] <ugoub> $this :not('.DataTable *')
[18:37:44] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: unluckly .$this match .DataTable
[18:38:14] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: You're gonna have to show me some markup, because you are not being clear.
[18:41:13] <guzzlefry> Does jQuery offer any type of element selection based on element data?
[18:41:44] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: I know how: $this.find('*').not($this.find('.DataTable *'))
[18:42:00] <goddard> anyone used full calendar
[18:42:07] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: but can it be more gentle/faster?
[18:43:02] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: I have told you that I don't know what you're trying to do. I hope there's a nicer way to do that, but you haven't shown me markup and an intended result, so I have no clue what you're after.
[18:43:12] <ProofTechnique> If that works for you, go for it.
[18:43:20] <ProofTechnique> Profile it
[18:43:31] <ProofTechnique> If there's a performance issue, then find out if there's a nicer way
[18:53:41] <tasaif> anyone in here a rails pro?
[18:57:29] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: http://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/ example
[18:58:13] <ProofTechnique> tasaif: Probably try #ruby
[18:58:35] <tasaif> #rubyonrails
[19:02:23] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: What's the intended result?
[19:02:26] <ProofTechnique> What number do you want?
[19:02:31] <ProofTechnique> 2, right?
[19:03:18] <ugoub> findNotDescendantOf
[19:03:46] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: What number?
[19:04:03] <ProofTechnique> It currently says 0, but as I understand it, you want it to say 2. Is that correct?
[19:04:06] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: 4 is right
[19:04:28] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: just looking for a gentle way. can the code be improveed?
[19:04:52] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: I count 3 that say wanted
[19:05:01] <ProofTechnique> In which case this works: http://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/1/
[19:05:34] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: at first I thought $this.find(':not(.DatTable *)'). will do the same. but I missundstand the :not()
[19:06:03] <Peter_Occ> When I click on a checkbox, it causes a search to reload. But if I check the box using jquery , the box is checked but  the search doesn't reload. Is there a difference between doing it manually and using jQuery?
[19:06:58] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: This will also work: http://jsfiddle.net/ofvbpgst/
[19:07:54] <ProofTechnique> Peter_Occ: There's an onclick event on the checkbox, but your script doesn't. You want https://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[19:08:32] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: Does that work for you?
[19:13:27] <goddard> anyone used full calendar
[19:17:25] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: sorry, the use case is more complicated. actully direct selector is not a choice:http://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/3/
[19:17:35] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: I want 5
[19:20:30] <ProofTechnique> What?
[19:22:51] <ProofTechnique> Look, unless you can show me some real markup, I legitimately don't know what your'e after. Also, your example markup is all over the place. You shouldn't have divs inside spans
[19:24:35] <ugoub> the result number i want is 5 in http://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/3/ . probably i guess the code can't be improved. How I wish i  canbe worte like: $this.find(':not($this .DataTable *)');
[19:25:42] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: It can't be 5 because one of your wanted divs isn't a child of #this
[19:26:40] <Peter_Occ> ProofTechnique, trigger does trigger the ajax reload, so that is progress. For some reason, it seems to uncheck the check box. Here is what I am doing:
[19:26:41] <Peter_Occ> jQuery('#radio_2157').prop( 'checked', true );
[19:26:43] <Peter_Occ>        jQuery('#radio_2157').trigger('click');
[19:27:42] <ProofTechnique> Peter_Occ: Change true to false. You're triggering the click when the box is checked, so it's unchecking it.
[19:28:37] <adavia> is this correct var container = $('.photos'); $(targ).html(data).find(container).html();
[19:28:49] <Peter_Occ> Wonerfull wonderfull
[19:31:27] <adavia> ?
[19:31:46] <ignite_v2> i want when i click on the close_circle it slideToggle the #slider_div, how can I do it referring to parents, childs, siblings... http://pastie.org/10051336 ? thank you!
[19:34:23] <ProofTechnique> ignite_v2: .parent(), .parents(), .children(), .siblings()?
[19:38:31] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: Judging by what you're after, that's the solution
[19:38:56] <adavia> is this correct var container = $('.photos'); $(targ).html(data).find(container).html();
[19:39:16] <adavia> i need to grab container from my data html
[19:39:42] <ProofTechnique> adavia: Does it work?
[19:39:52] <ProofTechnique> If it doesn't, then it's not correct.
[19:40:18] <adavia> no
[19:40:26] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: http://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/5/
[19:40:28] <ProofTechnique> A fiddle would probably be easier to digest than a line in a vacuum
[19:40:32] <adavia> it doesnt grab the element
[19:40:42] <adavia> well yeah
[19:43:06] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: thanks!
[19:43:28] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: I'll see if I can find something nicer, but I'm glad it works, anyway
[19:44:12] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: Oh!
[19:44:14] <ProofTechnique> I got something
[19:44:23] <ProofTechnique> http://jsfiddle.net/yhw2t7v7/
[19:44:28] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: ^
[19:45:37] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: oh ,yes. that's what i am looking for.¬
[19:47:07] <ignite_v2> ProofTechnique: http://codepen.io/dansku/pen/raPYGW I want when you click the X on the bottom it closes the div
[19:47:48] <ignite_v2> ok, nevermind, I forgot to add # ¬¬ haha
[19:48:30] <ignite_v2> but I need the X from the top button rotate back
[19:49:45] <ignite_v2> lets see what happens
[19:50:02] <ProofTechnique> ignite_v2: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JoxOOO
[19:50:04] <ProofTechnique> Also, that.
[19:50:37] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: how interesting! we should switch the order of targetSelector and parentselector like this:http://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/6/ am i  right?
[19:51:34] <ProofTechnique> ugoub: Yeah, that looks right. Looks like it's time to try it on your real markup and make sure it works :)
[19:52:04] <ugoub> ProofTechnique: many thanks!
[19:53:19] <ignite_v2> ProofTechnique: perfect thanks! :)
[19:53:59] <ProofTechnique> ignite_v2: It looks like what I did doesn't reset the other X, though, so that may need some tweaking
[19:54:12] <ignite_v2> yeah, just fixed
[19:54:24] <ignite_v2> http://codepen.io/dansku/pen/raPYGW this is what i want :)
[19:54:26] <ignite_v2> its working
[19:54:56] <ProofTechnique> Awesome!
[20:34:26] <ugoub> https://jsfiddle.net/1x1j5stc/7/ i guess this is the best.
[23:02:30] <jqueryius> Hi - could some one please look at this
[23:02:30] <jqueryius> http://pastebin.com/CDcU5xkJ
[23:02:51] <jqueryius> No matter which #show-hide-photo{X} I click, it always tries to toggle #photo100
[23:03:00] <jqueryius> its like it's overriding every previous one
[23:07:19] <jqueryius> ah
[23:07:24] <jqueryius> because click is called at run time
[23:07:28] <jqueryius> follow up question
[23:07:32] <jqueryius> $(this)...... etc
[23:07:37] <jqueryius> how do I get the name of "this"
[23:07:40] <jqueryius> dynamically
[23:08:08] <Uhkis> .attr('name');
[23:10:49] <jqueryius> Uhkis: follow up question
[23:10:56] <jqueryius> how do I only extract numbers from that?
[23:12:42] <jqueryius> I tried:  $(this).attr('id').text().match(/\((\d+)\)/)[1]
[23:12:48] <jqueryius> but console.log doesn't return anything
[23:13:22] <Uhkis> .match([0-9]+);
[23:14:48] <jqueryius> tried: $(this).attr('id').text().match('[0-9]+')[1];
[23:14:50] <jqueryius> doesn't work
[23:15:14] <jqueryius> "expression expected" error if I try without the apostraphes
[23:15:25] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/nze63fab/
[23:17:21] <jqueryius> not working :(
[23:18:03] <jqueryius> http://pastebin.com/tsFPYgiV
[23:18:25] <Uhkis> [0]
[23:18:45] <jqueryius> remove it?
[23:19:03] <Uhkis> look at the fiddle i made.
[23:20:15] <jqueryius> it doesn't work with [0] either
[23:20:27] <jqueryius> I changed it so console.log('test'); is the first line in the click()
[23:20:29] <jqueryius> I see that
[23:20:37] <jqueryius> then I have:  var thisName = $(this).attr('id').text().match(/[0-9]+/)[0];
[23:20:50] <jqueryius> and console.log('test2') after that.... I don't see the "test2"
[23:21:17] <Uhkis> where in my fiddle is there text() ?
[23:21:41] <jqueryius> ahhh
[23:21:43] <jqueryius> good pick up
[23:21:46] <jqueryius> yeah that was the problem
[23:21:48] <jqueryius> thanks
[23:24:58] <jqueryius> I might be pushing my luck here Uhkis, but do you know if there's any nice ways to slide toggle a table row (#photo{X} is a tr, that I want to appear and disappear on the button click). I tried slideToggle() but it was no different to toggle()
[23:27:39] <Uhkis> ?api animate @ jqueryius
[23:27:39] <b-ot> jqueryius: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[23:47:03] <GoSox> so i'm trying to use SVG images in <object> tags, but I can't seem to register a click on an object. If I bind a click even handler to an object, or an object's parent, nothing happens
[23:47:23] <GoSox> for example, bound to the object: http://jsfiddle.net/op3u6uam/18/
[23:47:31] <GoSox> bound to the object's parent: http://jsfiddle.net/op3u6uam/16/
[23:49:03] <GoSox> and its a really hard problem to google because the word "object" has so many meanings, including jquery objects. It makes it hard to search for this specific issue'
