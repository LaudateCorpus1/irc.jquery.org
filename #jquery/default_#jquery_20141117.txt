[00:56:29] <kinesis> im trying to use masonry.js and for some reason my div's overlap each other (something about images/content loading past .ready() ) .. what trigger event should handle this?
[00:56:44] <kinesis> this only happens in chrome, happens with vgrid.js too
[00:59:38] <kinesis>  they overlap each other on the horizontal edge
[01:02:41] <d3m0n> What about be a way to grab the largest lengths list by doing an each() call on the <ul>'s?
[01:02:56] <d3m0n> What would* be
[01:07:45] <Unopoo> anyone has the experience of using zeroClipboard?
[01:14:38] <kinesis> unloaded iframes are causing isotope or masonry.js elements to overlap
[01:14:40] <kinesis> how do i fix?
[01:14:53] <kinesis> I tried ImagesLoaded but it's not the images.. is there a iframesLoaded
[01:17:32] <Cork> kinesis: you might have to modify it you're self
[01:17:38] <Cork> wait for the load event from the iframe
[01:17:51] <Cork> and adjust the values of the plugin when it fires

[02:01:46] <slax0r> Cork: ^
[02:01:50] <slax0r> sry
[02:02:21] <Cork> ?
[02:02:40] <Cork> slax0r: report those spammers to freenode so they get g-lined
[02:02:42] <slax0r> read one line above, I addressed the message to the wrong person
[02:02:50] <slax0r> I closed the window already :/
[02:02:55] <slax0r> will do so next time
[02:03:11] <Cork> they are getting quite common now days...
[02:03:28] <slax0r> yeah, so I notices
[02:03:32] <slax0r> noticed*
[02:04:04] <Macaveli> slax0r insertBefore doesn't seem to do anything
[02:04:05] <carlton> Learn about the wonderful world of Sea Cucumbers @ www.seacucumbers.com
[02:04:31] <slax0r> Macaveli: on its own no, but there is a "workaround" to prepend a child
[02:04:48] <slax0r> Cork: seems someone else has reported him already ;)
[02:04:59] <Cork> nice
[02:05:54] <slax0r> Macaveli: there is no .prependChild function, but if you search for it, you will find tons of workarounds for it
[02:06:05] <Macaveli> thanks slax0r
[02:06:08] <Macaveli> i'll look for it
[02:13:25] <Cork> Macaveli: or you could just steal this http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.prepend
[02:13:48] <Macaveli> Cork I'm going with replaceWith probaly
[02:13:59] <Cork> replaceWith isn't in native dom either
[02:14:11] <Macaveli> I just noticed that :(
[02:14:29] <Cork> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.replaceWith
[02:16:19] <Cork> Macaveli: insertBefore should be able to do what you want though
[02:16:23] <Cork> fairly easy too
[02:16:55] <Cork> (though as you aren't using jquery you might want to take this in ##javascript
[02:16:56] <Cork> )
[02:17:06] <Macaveli> indeed m8 thanks for the suggestion Cork
[02:17:07] <Macaveli> :)
[02:18:41] <sprihodko> Hi. Need advice. Have simple code, but it seems dirty to me. Maybe i need to change it? http://pastie.org/9724807
[02:21:16] <Cork> sprihodko: use .filter(function() {})
[02:21:35] <Cork> or even better give the widget a class and use that
[02:22:35] <sprihodko> Cork: Thanks for advice!

[03:19:39] <djam90> Hey guys. If I have an event listener like: $('.goto-btn').on("click", function(){  is it possible to find out the index of which button was clicked? Say I have 4 buttons
[03:22:01] <jeffreylevesque> can i check the MIME type from an html form file upload?
[03:22:07] <djam90> For some reason, .index() is returning the wrong index?
[03:22:24] <shebbi> djam90:  try $(this).length
[03:23:08] <djam90> shebbi >> console.log( $('.goto-btn').length );    returns 4
[03:23:13] <djam90> so there are 4
[03:23:36] <shebbi> jeffreylevesque: yes you can but it's best you do that server-side, not client-side
[03:23:37] <djam90> but when I add    console.log(  $(this).index() );   inside the .click() then it returns an incorrect index
[03:23:46] <djam90> the index starts at 2 and goes 2,3,4,5   instead of    1,2,3,4
[03:23:50] <djam90> or 0,1,2,3
[03:23:56] <jeffreylevesque> i would like to do both
[03:24:16] <shebbi> jeffreylevesque: google is your friend.
[03:24:24] * shebbi is away
[03:32:18] <shebbi> djam90: $('.goto-btn').index( $(this) );
[03:32:36] <jeffreylevesque> shebbi, like this - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/commit/68ca8e94918b21f6f0c666a9deb6ee27bae065c7
[03:33:00] <djam90> Guys, I have 4 buttons and $(this).index() breaks if I add an element before it. Example: http://jsfiddle.net/ya7cc96t/    try removing the <hr> element and check the index in console
[03:33:09] <djam90> shebbi check that demo ^
[03:33:17] <_rgn> that's how index works
[03:33:22] <_rgn> apparently
[03:33:48] <_rgn> what are you even trying to achieve?
[03:33:55] <djam90> I want to get the index of the clicked button
[03:33:58] <djam90> so first button will return 0
[03:34:01] <_rgn> for what purpose?
[03:34:01] <djam90> second button returns 1
[03:34:09] <shebbi> djam90: I just showed you how
[03:34:23] <djam90> shebbi your example doesn't work in my example
[03:34:38] <djam90> when a button is clicked, I need the index of that button
[03:35:13] <shebbi> djam90: $('.goto-btn').on("click", function(){ alert ( $('.goto-btn').index( $(this) ) );
[03:36:09] <djam90> thanks shebbi
[03:36:12] <djam90> I understand it now
[03:42:58] <Cork> shebbi: no need for the $()
[03:43:01] <Cork> just do .index(this)
[03:43:40] <djam90> Cork awesome
[03:43:50] <shebbi> Cork: Why is that? still learning Master Yoda :)
[03:44:10] <Cork> shebbi: cause .index uses the dom element to look for the index in its internal array
[03:44:32] <Cork> so and if the argument is a jquery object it just does obj[0]
[03:45:32] <Cork> basically it does a loop and checkes if target == domElementInArray
[03:45:48] <Cork> and as you can compare two dom elements you find the id
[03:45:51] <Cork> *index
[03:45:52] <shebbi> Why can you not need $
[03:46:09] <Cork> so and if the argument is a jquery object it just does obj[0] <--
[03:46:29] <Cork> $() <-- creates a jquery object wrapped around the dom element
[03:46:47] <Cork> $(this)[0] === this
[03:48:11] <jcool> I am trying to select li generated at run time. but due to some reasons it is not getting selected
[03:48:13] <jcool> http://jsfiddle.net/nrLs2/20/
[03:48:29] <jcool> is there any alternative solution to this.
[03:49:09] <Cork> jcool: don't use live
[03:49:15] <Cork> it is an extreamly messy api
[03:50:16] <Cork> it is also deprecated and removed in 1.9+
[03:50:43] <jcool> Cork, alternative to that?
[03:50:52] <Cork> jcool: .delegate in older versions
[03:51:08] <Cork> or the new combined bind/delegate function .on in 1.9+
[03:51:32] <shebbi> how does the new one look lie
[03:51:35] <shebbi> like
[03:51:44] <jcool> Cork, cool. and how to do that li thing?
[03:51:47] <jcool> is it binding issue?
[03:52:07] <jcool> when you add it is added to li but you cant select it. You can select only once that are pre loaded
[03:52:26] <Cork> jcool: $("#a").on('click', 'li', function () {
[03:52:39] <Cork> jcool: yes it is a binding issue
[03:52:46] <Cork> you bind to an element before it exists
[03:53:14] <Cork> jcool: $("#a").on('keyup', '#1', function () { instead of the .live line
[03:53:29] <Cork> shebbi: new what look like?
[03:53:54] <shebbi> new bind.delegate
[03:54:21] <Cork> ah
[03:54:29] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[03:54:30] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[03:54:32] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com on
[03:54:38] <b-ot> Cork: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:54:44] <Cork> shebbi: read those
[03:54:51] <Cork> i recommend starting with .delegate
[03:55:09] <Cork> it explains the basics of delegated event listeners, and makes it easier to understand the different modes of .on
[03:55:37] <shebbi> more fun reading
[03:55:46] <shebbi> it never ends
[03:56:25] <jcool> Cork, excellent advice. I will take care of those things :)
[04:40:24] <intellilogic> Why doesn't this work:  var foo = $.ajax({url:location.origin+"/info.php",data:{q:'dev_servers'}}).responseText   (It returns an object that as the propery responseText...
[04:41:26] <intellilogic> var foo = $.ajax({url:location.origin+"/info.php",data:{q:'dev_servers'}}); foo.responseText  //result    that works...
[04:41:43] <intellilogic> I am trying to asign in a single line (inside an object)
[04:42:41] <Cork> intellilogic: ajax is async
[04:42:47] <Cork> foo.responseText shouldn't ever work
[04:42:56] <Cork> use the done/success callbacks
[04:43:32] <intellilogic> $.ajax({async:false,url:location.origin+"/rhaydenenterprises.com/global/info.php",data:{q:'dev_servers'}}).responseText  //solved
[04:43:40] <intellilogic> Thanks Cork
[04:44:15] <Cork> intellilogic: don't ever, ever, ever, EVER, E-V-E-R use async: false
[04:44:22] <Cork> use the callbacks
[04:44:50] <Cork> async false is old deprecated legacy code, that breaks the interface (locks it)
[04:44:57] <Cork> is very use hostile (hangs the browser)
[04:45:16] <Cork> and is completely unneeded (except for one single case, calls from unload)
[04:45:21] <mooncup> ok so what you're saying is that async false is better?
[04:45:22] <mooncup> thanks!
[04:45:37] <Cork> <_<'
[04:45:54] <Cork> no... i say don't use the async option at all
[04:45:59] <Cork> use the default async: true
[04:46:13] <Cork> and write the code to handle async code
[04:46:39] <mooncup> :D
[04:46:41] <Cork> it isn't hard with todays promise tools
[04:46:47] <mooncup> ok lunch calls
[04:47:15] <intellilogic> Cork, it's for a ling in a development object, everything else is true.  I realize what it does.
[04:48:17] <Cork> intellilogic: writing the code to not use async: false isn't much harder
[04:48:53] <Cork> and you really should take for common to practice not thinking sync when it comes to network
[06:18:18] <Axy> Hey all
[06:18:27] <Axy> when using togleclass, how can I larn the toggled class
[06:18:44] <Axy> I mean, the "result" class
[06:33:00] <jQuery> As part of an interview I've done a take-home technical challenge. I'm very comfortable with most of it, but the document makes it clear they want tests included in the final result. I've never really done much automated testing before. There's sample data included with the question. Can anyone suggest a good, small open-source project that includes tests so I can get an idea of what's expected?
[06:33:10] <d0de> oops
[06:38:48] <d0de> As in, a well written projects with tests so I look at it and see what good tests look like
[06:39:14] <Cork> d0de: what language?
[06:39:25] <d0de> javascript / jQuery
[06:39:39] <d0de> but anything javascripty really
[06:39:40] <Cork> could have a look at jquery ui i guess
[06:40:43] <Cork> i think they use i think they use quintjs
[06:41:00] <Cork> *i think they use quintjs
[06:41:19] <Cork> d0de: you might also want to check https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test/unit
[06:41:21] <Cork> for example
[06:41:55] <d0de> This is kind of embarrassing, but I know next to nothing about testing (it's an entry-level position) so I'll ask anyway. Tests are written using a framework but are run-anywhere, right? Or is there some special infrastructure to run them?
[06:42:20] <Cork> d0de: depends on the language and framework
[06:42:36] <Cork> some js test suite depend on node.js
[06:42:43] <Cork> some can be run in the browser
[06:42:58] <d0de> is there something typical for javascript? Or does it vary too much for there to be a standard?
[06:43:21] <Cork> i don't know of a standard library no
[06:43:36] <Cork> there isn't normally any standard library at all in js :)
[06:43:51] <Cork> that is largely the point, developers option
[06:44:09] <d0de> OK, thanks. Also, once I'm done, do you think it's an ethical violation to ask someone to look over my work before sending it in?
[06:44:34] <Cork> d0de: you will most likely have problem finding someone willing to do it for free
[06:44:49] <Cork> revewing takes quite a bit of time
[06:45:08] <xnotte> i'm calling $.getJson("/method/action") in hostname.com/contacts/ (using aspnet mvc). but i have a problem. When i call it from hostname.com/contacts/ it will call "hostname.com/contacts/action" and it works. But if i'm in the same page, but coming from another action thats in url location "hostname.com/contacts/search", it will call "hostname.com/contacts/contacts/action" . How can i solve this ?
[06:45:23] <d0de> Fair enough - but hypothetically, what do you think of the ethics, just so I know?
[06:45:51] <Cork> xnotte: your most likely missing the leading &
[06:45:52] <Cork> opps
[06:45:55] <Cork> leading /
[06:46:29] <Cork> d0de: as long as the place you want to work at don't explicitly forbid it, i don't see a problem
[06:46:43] <d0de> Cool. Thanks for your advice Cork, v helpful
[06:47:00] <Cork> though it is meant to reflect your capabilities, so you might want to be honest with what you would do
[06:47:24] <Cork> else it might be problematic if you later get the job, but can't perform what they ask of you
[06:47:40] <Cork> just have that caveat in mind when you ask someone for help
[06:48:08] <d0de> Sure. I wasn't really thinking of a full review, more like writing the tests and then asking someone "do you think this is the kind of thing they're expecting, given the wording of the question"
[06:48:08] <Cork> "would have been able to do this by my self"
[06:48:35] <Cork> d0de: irc free help is normally the other way around
[06:48:45] <Cork> you do something and as specific questions
[06:49:10] <Cork> so write the test, and if you find a point you think isn't really right
[06:49:20] <Cork> ask about that point, and see if someone have a better idea
[06:49:32] <Cork> that normally will give you much more responses
[06:49:42] <Cork> then "can someone have a look at this and say if it looks ok"
[06:49:50] <Cork> (those are often ignored)
[06:50:40] <Cork> so be specific with the question, the more specific you are the more likely you will get a quick and good answer
[06:50:47] <sweet2k4> noob question: how would i set a value to the php session array with a jquery function?
[06:51:05] <d0de> That makes sense. Thanks!
[06:51:21] <Cork> sweet2k4: the entire point of php session is that it isn't accessible from client side
[06:51:24] <Cork> it is "secure"
[06:51:56] <Cork> sweet2k4: so you would have to do a network call back to the server to change the value (preferably a post)
[06:52:41] <sweet2k4> Cork: hmm ok.
[06:53:17] <sweet2k4> Cork: but cant i call a PHP function from jquery?
[06:53:22] <Cork> no
[06:53:23] <xnotte> Cork: thanks thats it. But i've solved that problem, but created a minor one. my website it's in hostname.com/company/contacts (company because it's in development environment) and it will pass later to hostname.com/contacts. So i have to put $.getJson("company/method/action") but when deploying i have to go to that line in a JS file to remove the "company". Any way to prevent this on deploy ?
[06:53:31] <Cork> sweet2k4: php runs server side, js runs client side
[06:53:51] <Cork> sweet2k4: php creates text, this text is then sent over the network to the browser
[06:53:58] <Cork> that parses it and do "things"
[06:54:54] <Cork> xnotte: you should poke at the one setting up the development server to use subdomains for the different projects
[06:55:01] <Cork> xnotte: then you wouldn't have this problem
[06:55:32] <Cork> xnotte: and no there isn't a good way around that; you simply should development environment be a closer match to live
[06:55:44] <Cork> *should make development
[06:55:53] <xnotte> Cork: ok thanks !
[06:56:01] <Cork> virtual hosts are basically free
[06:56:07] <sweet2k4> Cork: yeah ok i understand. il try find another solution. thanks
[06:56:08] <Cork> so there is little reason not to do so
[06:57:14] <Cork> oh wait
[06:57:19] <Cork> you said asp
[06:57:25] <Cork> then ya, then vhosts has a cost
[06:57:44] <Cork> but it is still much smaller then the risk of pushing a release that is broken
[06:57:55] <Cork> cause the development environment isn't similar enough to live
[06:57:58] <fuusooo> hey guys, i'm really confused when it comes to incoporating jquery into websites, like there always seems to be different methods of declaring it, some use $, and then ontop with .noconflict, is there some place i can finally fiugre this out?
[06:58:39] <Cork> fuusooo: if you write a clean page without any external dependencies
[06:58:42] <Cork> you just use $
[06:58:48] <Cork> jquery define this one by default
[06:59:12] <Cork> you only need noConflict if jquery need to work together with a third party framework that already uses $
[06:59:26] <fuusooo> well this part always confuses me, i need to find something to give me a better overview of how things work
[06:59:35] <Cork> (or if you do the really bad idea of loading multiple jqueries on the same page)
[06:59:46] <Cork> fuusooo: what is confusing you?
[06:59:58] <fuusooo> like i do a lot of wordpress work
[07:00:04] <fuusooo> and try to incorporate jquery stuff
[07:00:12] <fuusooo> but, i'm note 100% sure about what i'm doing
[07:00:28] <fuusooo> i use the methods alright, but setting it up is often touch and go
[07:00:37] <Cork> fuusooo: if you want to use jquery in an environment where you don't know what exist around you
[07:01:04] <Cork> wrapping it in jQuery(function($) {}); is a simple way to make sure $ is jquery inside the ready handler
[07:01:27] <Cork> ^that is a short hand for jQuery(document).ready(function($) {});
[07:02:06] <Cork> fuusooo: simply before you include jquery in a page
[07:02:12] <Cork> start by checking if $ is in use
[07:02:19] <Cork> and what library that is
[07:02:33] <Cork> if it is jquery, grate you don't need to do anything
[07:02:49] <Cork> if it is something like prototype your in for a bit of a pain
[07:05:58] <fuusooo> hm, thx, is that shorthand something unique to jquery(document)?
[07:06:47] <Cork> normally $ is just a variable pointing to jQuery (window.$ = window.jQuery)
[07:07:08] <Cork> and $(function(){}) is a shorthand for .ready on document
[07:07:32] <Cork> (also notice the capital Q not jquery)
[07:07:44] <sweet2k4> what is the jquery syntax for setting the  .innerHTML of an element. is it the same as java?
[07:07:58] <Cork> sweet2k4: .html()
[07:08:17] <sweet2k4> Cork: ok thanks.
[07:08:23] <Cork> sweet2k4: api.jquery.com is a good place to search for answers to those kind of questions
[07:08:30] <Cork> that site is really good
[07:09:23] <sweet2k4> yeah i found it there but i wasent sure if i could use it as a setter, not only a getter :)
[07:11:43] <Cork> sweet2k4: http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[07:11:56] <Cork> you need to look harder ;P
[07:12:02] <Cork> j/k
[07:12:36] <Cork> sweet2k4: just to be clear, asking is fine, hard to learn where to look if you don't
[07:14:29] <sweet2k4> Cork: yeah, thanks. sometimes its also good to ask to make sure you got it right :9 btw the link didnt work
[07:14:31] <sweet2k4> :)
[07:14:57] <sweet2k4> Cork: oh, it did, my pc was just slow :)
[07:15:02] <Cork> :)
[07:15:36] <Cork> sweet2k4: and sure, better ask so you learn the right thing then steaming down the wrong path
[07:16:48] <sweet2k4> Cork: that is true, many times i found a solution on the net or in a book that works but isnt the right way to do it. by asking here in the chat i relized that i get the most correct answers
[07:17:17] <Cork> sweet2k4: ya, so is a really good example of that
[07:17:22] <fuusooo> cork i need a jquery resource guide, any suggestions?
[07:17:31] <fuusooo> something that will cover enqueueing, and noconflict type stuff
[07:17:32] <Cork> especially for jquery related questions
[07:17:58] <Cork> fuusooo: learn.jquery.com most likely have something
[07:18:14] <Cork> fuusooo: you could also have a look at the function specifications in api.jquery.com
[07:18:46] <fuusooo> i've never really properly learned javascript, is there something i should try to learn from them too, or just go straigh to learn.jquery.com
[07:18:55] <fuusooo> kinda just been reading guides to do what iw ant
[07:23:08] <Cork> fuusooo: if you had asked me a few years back i would have said "start with the basics"
[07:23:50] <fuusooo> yeah i hear you, stacks of librarys now
[07:23:51] <Cork> i still partly think that is true (you need to know how to do functions, loops set values aromatics, and the other basic building blocks of programming)
[07:24:01] <fuusooo> stuff being built on each other
[07:24:03] <fuusooo> ant learn everything
[07:24:06] <fuusooo> cant*
[07:24:27] <Cork> but i learned from own experience (not in programming) that it is much better to go the other way around
[07:24:33] <Cork> learn enough to get starting
[07:24:53] <fuusooo> i've done that, but in my wordpress skillset jquery is really a big hole
[07:25:01] <Cork> and as you find interesting areas dive deeper
[07:25:11] <Cork> it is a much more sustainable way of learning
[07:25:21] <Cork> as it is much easier to stay motivated
[07:25:35] <Cork> cause you feel that something actually works :)
[07:25:36] <fuusooo> well, if you know of any good guides besides learn.jquery plz tell me
[07:26:34] <Cork> i have heard that http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/ is good too
[07:26:47] <Cork> (haven't used any of them my self though)
[07:27:20] <fuusooo> k thx ill check it out
[07:27:22] <fuusooo> seems pretty short
[07:28:45] <Cork> fuusooo: if you know any c derived language, it isn't very hard
[07:29:18] <Cork> the biggest problem if you do is learning the concept of scoped variables and prototype
[07:29:24] <Cork> the rest is quite straight forward
[07:29:32] <fuusooo> i actually think its just the way jquery is called which has always confused me
[07:29:46] <maddtech> I'm trying to write a small script to take JSON data and return it to a div.  I'm getting an Unexpected Identifier on my $holder = "<div ...
[07:29:52] <maddtech> line.  Can anyone help me?
[07:30:17] <BillCriswell> maddtech: How are you trying to set the text of the div?
[07:30:19] <Cork> fuusooo: ya, many think that $ is something special or magical
[07:30:31] <Cork> fuusooo: it isn't its just a function name, just like anything else
[07:30:40] <maddtech> I'm getting my code up to share.  Give me two seconds.
[07:31:18] <BillCriswell> maddtech: It would be something like... $('div').text(JSON.stringify(response));
[07:31:59] <maddtech> http://www.codeshare.io/pRtwn BillCriswell
[07:32:40] <maddtech> This is what my json data looks like.  [{"id":"17","status":"1","description":"Test","active":"1"}]
[07:32:55] <BillCriswell> maddtech: 19 errors.
[07:33:19] <maddtech> That's how many you spot?
[07:33:40] <BillCriswell> No way. Computer tells me that kind of stuff.
[07:33:59] <maddtech> Well hell.
[07:34:09] <BillCriswell> Look at your console and make sure there's no errors (that you can't figure out) before asking your question.
[07:34:19] <BillCriswell> that you can figure out*
[07:34:45] <maddtech> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier   BillCriswell That is what I got from my console.
[07:35:35] <BillCriswell> maddtech: You're concatenating strings wrong.
[07:36:11] <maddtech> Okay.  How do I do it?  I'm a complete newbie to jquery
[07:36:55] <BillCriswell> maddtech: That's a javascript thing, doesn't have anything to do with jQuery really.
[07:37:28] <maddtech> Okay.  Thanks.
[07:40:21] <BillCriswell> You should look into using templates. Managing this string concatenation is going to be a bitch.
[07:42:10] <d0de> is it bad coding practice to create an object field with something like `object["valueName"] = myvalue;` ?
[07:42:45] <BillCriswell> d0de: A linter might tell you to use object.valueName = myvalue; but it's your call.
[07:43:50] <d0de> I guess it just seems redundant to me to have to do var valueName = "valueName"; object.valueName = myvalue, but I can see how some people might see it as being better
[07:47:54] <BillCriswell> d0de: You can do object.valueName = "valueName";
[07:48:09] <BillCriswell> Unless you want valueName to be the property name on the object?
[07:48:47] <d0de> I lost the meaning of my problem by choosing a bad example - I'm actually dealing with obj["thing1"]["thing2]
[07:50:02] <BillCriswell> As long as obj.thing1 is defined that's ok to do as well.
[07:52:22] <d0de> ahh, I hadn't properly understood the difference between object.name = foo; and object[name] = foo; where "name" is a variable with a value
[07:52:49] <BillCriswell> d0de: Oh, if name is a variable than you have to use object[name].
[07:53:00] <_DB> anyone know how I can make it so when I click a row in my table itll send me to another page   <tr data-id="{{$exhibit -> exhibit_id}}" onclick="window.location('/exhibits?exid={{$exhibit -> exhibit_id}}')">
[07:53:13] <d0de> yep I see that now!
[07:53:20] <_DB> im using a MVC (laravel) so the {{data}} is data I sent to the view
[07:55:10] <BillCriswell> _DB: I'd just output the whole link in a data attribute and use that.
[07:55:32] <_DB> yeah I was trying to use inline js no doubt
[07:56:10] <BillCriswell> data-exhibit-url="{{ $exhibit -> url }}" then do like $('[data-exhibit-url]').on('click', function () { window.location = $(this).data('exhibit-url'); });
[08:05:45] <HamMan> Hey guys if I have an element that has a data-attr with an array of image urls in it, how would I load those images most efficiently ?
[08:20:35] <sharax> hi frineds
[08:20:37] <sharax> http://jsfiddle.net/sharax/27zzgtvv/
[08:20:52] <sharax> error in my code :  SyntaxError: missing ] after element list [object Object]
[08:21:51] <decx> the hell?
[08:22:43] <sharax> what?!
[08:24:12] <sharax> Who does not help?!
[08:25:37] <null--> var kk = setTimeout(ok, 500); <-- ok needs to be a function
[08:26:07] <BillCriswell> Not an array.
[08:26:52] <BillCriswell> I can't type your nick HamMan or whatever.

[08:44:02] <sekyms> Does anyone know of a JS/CSS framework specifically for writing code tutorials?
[08:45:11] <s5fs> no, but i'm curious about the features you're interested in
[08:45:21] <s5fs> I mostly just write documentation, so markdown is good enough for me.
[08:46:04] <sekyms> s5fs: I'm not real sure.  I could get away with bootstrap, but I wasn't sure if there was anything super cool out there that anyone knew of
[08:46:55] <s5fs> sekyms: have you seen the nodeschool stuff? depending on your needs, that could be an approach.
[08:47:27] <s5fs> sekyms: peep this https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper
[08:48:01] <sekyms> yeah I would like to keep in online-browser based
[08:49:04] <s5fs> haha, no coffee yet, could've sworn I was in #Node.js
[08:49:11] <sekyms> no worries
[08:50:50] <s5fs> in theory you could embed some jsfiddles in a site and use that as the base. really curious to see what you come up with, best of luck!
[08:50:59] <sekyms> thanks
[08:59:58] <ciqsteve> Q:  How do I set scrollTop when images load dynamically?   (more..)
[09:00:17] <ciqsteve> I display an image on the screen that is potentially larger than the viewport.
[09:00:24] <ciqsteve> so the user can scroll to see the bottom of the image
[09:00:51] <ciqsteve> when the user advances to the next image I want the position to be the same on the next image (the bottom on this case)
[09:01:04] <ciqsteve> I'm using local storage and scrollTop to reposition this
[09:01:10] <ciqsteve> and I do it via onLoad for the image
[09:01:27] <ciqsteve> but it only works if the image has already been loaded once before
[09:01:47] <ciqsteve> so, if I view 1, 2, 3  it doesn't work.. but if I go back to 1 and then move to 2.. it works fine
[09:02:02] <ciqsteve> not sure how to 'fix' this.. any ideas?
[09:02:27] <robertmaxrees> I'm not even sure what you're trying to do.  can you cook up an example?
[09:03:24] <ciqsteve> hmm maybe
[09:03:51] <ciqsteve> in short I'm trying to adjust the scroll position for a page when there is a dynamically loaded image
[09:03:54] <robertmaxrees> at least showing us your code would be helpful because it's hard to understand what your problem is.
[09:04:19] <gurke_> hi@all :)
[09:04:22] <ciqsteve> rmax  - y understood.. will try to pull out the relevant code and pasbin it
[09:05:34] <ciqsteve> code;   http://pastebin.com/pHPyUcpb
[09:07:12] <robertmaxrees> this code assumes the images will all be vertically the same sizwe.
[09:07:40] <robertmaxrees> you said something about "when they'
[09:08:09] <robertmaxrees> *when they're on the botton of image foo, they should also wind up and the bottom of image bar".  are the images the same dimensions?
[09:08:22] <robertmaxrees> also - I'd attach your event listener before setting the src prop
[09:09:59] <robertmaxrees> try something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/bsdy6vi/#url=1by56tc
[09:10:03] <ciqsteve> rmax - they are all the same size (the are pages in a document)
[09:10:32] <ciqsteve> so if a user is on page 2 for doc A, when they move to doc B I want them to be on page 2
[09:10:41] <ciqsteve> rmax -- will take a look
[09:11:16] <robertmaxrees> ps use people's full screennames.  most of us have clients that'll autonotify us that we've been mentioned :)
[09:12:01] <ciqsteve> @robertmaxrees  y - just being lazy  :)
[09:12:18] <robertmaxrees> also - when you prepend with @, it usually doesn't work :)
[09:12:47] <ilhami> I am a noob
[09:12:51] <ciqsteve> ahh  didnt know that
[09:12:58] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees
[09:12:59] <ciqsteve> thanks
[09:26:25] <doug64k> tab usually autocompletes people's names: ciq<tab> -> ciqsteve
[09:27:05] <ciqsteve> doug64k, v nice..thx
[09:27:40] <ciqsteve> fixed it be pre-loading the images (load image, load image+1)... adds complexity, but works
[09:28:12] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need to do that, but OK.
[09:29:47] <doug64k> doug64k: it's been a while since you have talked to me, is everything ok?
[09:30:33] <doug64k> I have addressed myself accidentally like that before though :)
[09:55:07] <frank_o> Hi! How does one copy the HTML generated when pressing the Selectize.js select box at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/47efnunq/? It disappears when clicking elsewhere (ie. somewhere in Dev Tools). I need the HTML for this other test case I'm doing (Selectize + iScroll for mobile).
[09:58:32] <robertmaxrees> the markup is there, just hidden
[10:11:46] <doug64k> frank_o: can't you bring up the debugger and find it in the elements tab? using the click-to-find
[10:12:00] <robertmaxrees> that's what I did.
[10:15:07] <doug64k> frank_o: once you have found that element in the elements tab, right click it and choose copy outer html
[10:15:14] <doug64k> that is the whole html, including the parent
[10:15:31] <doug64k> not the parent, including itself
[10:29:34] <frank_o> Hi! How does one copy the HTML generated when pressing the Selectize.js select box at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/47efnunq/? It disappears when clicking elsewhere (ie. somewhere in Dev Tools). I need the HTML for this other test case I'm doing.
[10:29:58] <frank_o> (sorry got disconnected. Did anybody reply earlier?)
[10:30:10] <bbclover> hey guys, I want to make this element stay on the bottom left and the css isn't working out so I wanted to do it with jquery. I have onscroll: workflowGraphContainer.stop().animate({ "marginTop": ($(window).scrollTop() + 5) + "px" }, "1000"); and this keeps it in the bottom right, but I can continuously scroll down slowly increasing the size of the page haha
[10:31:00] <robertmaxrees> frank_o yes, few people did.
[10:31:06] <robertmaxrees> look in your inspector.
[10:31:08] <robertmaxrees> it's in thre.
[10:44:48] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: Hi!
[10:44:58] <robertmaxrees> hello
[10:45:51] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: It seems though that `selectize-dropdown-content` only gets filled when the dropdown is active.
[10:46:25] <frank_o> I tried forcing element state to active / focused but that didn't seem to have any effect.
[10:46:27] <robertmaxrees> the first time, sure.
[10:46:31] <robertmaxrees> and then it works.
[10:47:29] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: I'll be damned -- thanks dude
[10:47:41] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[10:47:43] <frank_o> Could almost swear it cleared out
[11:04:14] <ciqsteve> Q:  I have this jquery statement
[11:04:25] <ciqsteve> var ordinal = $(active_question).data('ordinal')
[11:04:28] <ciqsteve> returns 1
[11:04:59] <ciqsteve> but if I inspect the element it says data-ordinal="5"
[11:05:05] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't access the markup.
[11:05:10] <robertmaxrees> it accesses a cached copy.
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> which is much faster and cleaner than accessing markup.
[11:05:29] <ciqsteve> ok that's bad (for me)
[11:05:33] <robertmaxrees> why?
[11:06:09] <ciqsteve> because I am using ordinals to move through the dom to display docs, so if on ordinal 1 and user says next I just display the element where data = ordinal 2
[11:06:20] <ciqsteve> but if the user sorts the ordinals get reapplied with the new order - so they change
[11:06:44] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() to get the ones you want./
[11:07:03] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are not really meant for selecting.
[11:07:07] <robertmaxrees> classes are great for that.
[11:07:54] <ciqsteve> I'm not selecting by it.. I have element 1 in context  .. so i ask it what ordinal it is then + 1 to get ordinal 2
[11:08:05] <ciqsteve> even if I filtered to find ordinal 2 I'd still get the wrong things
[11:08:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:08:10] <robertmaxrees> why?
[11:08:18] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting the ordinals?
[11:08:51] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees
[11:08:53] <ciqsteve> err
[11:08:59] <ciqsteve> $(this).attr('data-ordinal', i);
[11:09:00] <robertmaxrees> share some code, yo.
[11:09:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:09:08] <robertmaxrees> use .data() to set them.
[11:09:09] <robertmaxrees> not .attr()
[11:09:15] <BillCriswell> Ever have something go so smoothly you're suspicious?
[11:09:20] <robertmaxrees> all the time hahaha
[11:09:48] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, put that puts them in jquery somewhere, no?  meaning I can no longer see them attached to the element
[11:09:54] <suda> question:  example http://jsfiddle.net/L2L6h7vz/1/ in firefox e.target is the button, but in chrome it's the icon (i tag) inside. Is this expected behaviour or some bug in the way I do it or in jquery?
[11:09:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't WANT them attached to the element, ciqsteve
[11:10:01] <ciqsteve> put - but
[11:10:07] <robertmaxrees> if you want that info on the element, use IDs or classes.
[11:10:40] <ciqsteve> I like them on the element b/c it makes debugging the jquery much easier as I can see the attached data on every element
[11:10:52] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[11:11:02] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[11:11:34] <ciqsteve> ok.. out of curiosity.. is it possible to force it to pull from the dom and not the cache
[11:11:35] <ciqsteve> ?
[11:12:25] <robertmaxrees> a big reason you use .data() is precisely because you want to avoid hitting them DOM when possible.
[11:13:39] <ciqsteve> performance isn't a big deal here as there aren't that many elements
[11:14:15] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, can I see jquery data values in chrome dev tools?
[11:14:54] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve you can log them out.
[11:15:12] <ciqsteve> :O
[11:16:44] <ciqsteve> robertmaxrees, ok.. changing to jquery data
[11:16:53] <ciqsteve> tho I hate it  ;)
[11:17:04] <robertmaxrees> it's not that bad.  you'll get used to it pretty quick.
[11:17:17] <ciqsteve> I currently use this
[11:17:18] <ciqsteve> var active_question = $("[data-ordinal='0']")
[11:17:39] <ciqsteve> what does it change to?
[11:18:05] <robertmaxrees> i mentioned this earlier - if you need something to select on, you should be using classes/IDs instead.
[11:18:12] <robertmaxrees> data attributes aren't meant for selecting.
[11:18:23] <robertmaxrees> if you have a small set of elements. use a .filter() to get the one you want.
[11:18:43] <BillCriswell> $('.sections-with-data-ordinal').filter(function () { return $(this).data('ordinal') === 0; });
[11:19:03] <ciqsteve> BillCriswell, thx
[11:24:49] <ciqsteve> here goes nothing
[11:29:57] <ciqsteve> BillCriswell, robertmaxrees how to see jquery data in dev tools?
[11:30:00] <ciqsteve> chrome
[11:30:16] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: console.log($(this).data());
[11:31:04] <ciqsteve> how about viewing in a panel..  I vaguely remember reading about a plugin that provided that...
[11:31:14] <robertmaxrees> might be able to find something.
[11:31:23] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't need to see everything all the time like that.
[11:37:26] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: I'm using this thing called Vue and there's a little dev tool extention that lets me view data associated to the element when I inspect it.
[11:37:48] <ciqsteve> BillCriswell,
[11:37:50] <ciqsteve> aweseome thx
[11:38:12] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: That would require a big rerite probably lol. Just letting you know it's probably psosible.
[11:38:19] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vuejs/vue-devtools/master/screenshots/todomvc.png
[11:38:27] <ciqsteve> thx
[11:51:07] <mikehaas763> 5
[11:51:21] <robertmaxrees> 6
[11:55:56] <BillCriswell> 7
[11:56:08] <thinkxl_> 8
[11:56:10] <thinkxl_> I win?
[11:57:48] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:57:58] <BillCriswell> I don't know where to go from there so you win.
[11:59:14] <snover> BillCriswell: normally you’d go up to 11.
[11:59:53] <BillCriswell> That's my favorite number.
[12:05:17] <decx> step 4: to anything but a todo list
[12:05:23] <decx> to do*
[12:07:15] <BillCriswell> decx: hahaha
[12:09:04] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm digging Vue for the most part. A couple things I'm having trouble graping but it's mostly going well.
[12:17:35] <naeluh> yo
[12:17:41] <naeluh> hey I got a weird question
[12:18:48] <naeluh> Does anyone know if this shit still works ? fb://publish/profile/#ID#?text=#BODY# I tried a bunch of different ways and only got this to work fb://profile to work ? Any Thoughts ?
[12:19:21] <naeluh> I want to share to the native app and not the website
[12:19:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:22:08] <BillCriswell> naeluh: Try it and see?
[12:22:50] <naeluh> BillCriswell: I did on my iphone 4 didnt work thought it might be cause I ahve an old phone or something
[12:22:52] <naeluh> thanks
[12:23:33] <naeluh> BillCriswell: I dont have a real way to test it very much that is why I was reaching out the irc if any one knew kinda the status of this type of thing
[12:24:06] <naeluh> twitter://post?message=hello%20world this works really well for twitter
[12:24:16] <naeluh> <a href="twitter://post?message=hello%20world" target="_blank">
[12:30:04] <BillCriswell> Never knew you could do that.
[12:31:59] <mdan> hi, does anyone know what the basic requirements are of jquery UI? I'm trying to shrink my download size
[12:32:08] <mdan> e.g. what parts of jquery i can safely exclude
[12:34:45] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're doing.
[12:35:13] <mdan> robertmaxrees, I'm writing an application that only supports relatively recent browsers
[12:35:36] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really change my statement.  you'd leave out the bits you wouldn't need.
[12:35:45] <mdan> sure, i don't need anything, really
[12:35:47] <robertmaxrees> how would we know what you do/don't need?
[12:35:52] <mdan> as i said
[12:35:58] <mdan> basic requirements of JqueryUI
[12:36:23] <mdan> let's say "core" for now
[12:37:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryui.com/download/#!
[12:37:27] <robertmaxrees> there is a "UI Core" package
[12:37:31] <mdan> yes i've done that already
[12:37:34] <robertmaxrees> wel, "package"
[12:37:37] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're asking.
[12:37:40] <mdan> jquery UI depends on jquery
[12:37:43] <mdan> i am asking
[12:37:44] <BillCriswell> mdan: What widgets and shit are you using?
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> we have no way of knowing what you do/don't need because we don't know what you're using.
[12:38:03] <mdan> which parts of jquery do i need for core jquery UI + slider and dialog
[12:38:08] <mdan> actually, scratch dialog
[12:38:39] <robertmaxrees> just use the 2.x series and you should be fine.  why strip it down that far?
[12:38:46] <BillCriswell> Just check the slider checkbox and it should give you minimal download for just that.
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> he wants to remove everything unnecessary in core jquery as well, BillCriswell
[12:40:19] <BillCriswell> Oh, that would be way more effort than I'd be willing to help out with lol.
[12:40:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:40:34] <mdan> if it's not common knowledge or easy to say, i can just use the google CDN and assume everyone has jquery :)
[12:40:43] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:40:48] <robertmaxrees> what's the use case?
[12:40:54] <BillCriswell> mdan: http://jqueryui.com/download/#!version=1.11.2&components=1110000000000000010000000000000000000 is the minimal download for the slider.
[12:41:04] <mdan> BillCriswell, I've already done that, thanks
[12:41:11] <BillCriswell> ok.
[12:41:12] <mdan> but it includes a generic JQuery lib as well
[12:41:18] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery btw :)
[12:41:20] <mdan> i was wondering if i can further strip it down
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[12:41:42] <mdan> that i'm using other giant ass libraries
[12:41:45] <mdan> :)
[12:42:01] <mdan> i think depending on cache and CDN is the answer
[12:42:12] <mdan> sorry for asking such a confusing question
[12:42:23] <robertmaxrees> after you clarified it made sense.
[12:42:47] <mdan> also I found the modules section of the read me
[12:43:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can load different modules as needed.
[12:43:12] <robertmaxrees> but depending on the use case, it might not be necessary.
[12:43:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery 2.1.1 is 82.27kb.  compress a few images and you'll make that up just fine.
[12:43:51] <mdan> you mean 82.27 compressed, right?
[12:43:58] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:44:18] <mdan> i'm also gzipping, so maybe that will further help
[12:44:25] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.
[12:44:38] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't worry about it that much personally.
[12:44:54] <mdan> page load is visible slow. very few images
[12:45:05] <robertmaxrees> what other libraries are you using?
[12:45:09] <mdan> three.js
[12:45:21] <mdan> plus all my code, which is a lot by now
[12:45:34] <mdan> maybe i can shrink it, with jQuery :)
[12:45:34] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't going to be the culprit there imo.
[12:45:38] <mdan> haha
[12:45:42] <robertmaxrees> aaaah that's what you're getting at.
[12:46:16] <robertmaxrees> good luck :) i'm off to lunch.
[12:46:18] <mdan> thanks
[12:46:19] <mdan> cheers
[12:49:00] <bbclover> hey guys there is a td with a class that's used more than once who contains a div with a unique id. The td has a width that I want to change (just this specific td, not all of them). How can I do that?
[12:50:27] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You can do $('#someid').closest('td'), or $('td').has('#someid')
[12:50:50] <BillCriswell> The closest() way would be quicker.
[12:50:55] <bbclover> it'll propagate up?
[12:51:15] <BillCriswell> Yeah, closest() will bubble up till it mathes the given selector.
[12:58:48] <ckb> Hey guys, I got a quick question for you. I'm making an ajax call. It's coming back as JSON. If I console.log(result.data); it shows me all the objects in result.data. Works as expected. But now I'm trying to iterate through these results.data objects and I'm using $(results.data).each(function(i, e) { … }); however e is references results.data?
[13:00:07] <ckb> $.each instead. ah
[13:14:55] <BillCriswell> Lol
[13:24:16] <stangeland> I have a boolean array. Is there a nice way to check if all entries in array are true, or do i have to make a loop?
[13:25:35] <kinesis> I have a masonry.js problem. Something about the images or web content fully loading and the div panels overlapping and the calculations being off. I've tried document.ready and imagesLoaded but they don't resolve the issue.
[13:26:07] <BillCriswell> stangeland: javascript has a .every method.
[13:26:51] <BillCriswell> IE9+
[13:27:09] <ThomasWaldmann> moin. just a quick question for you who have experience with jquery 2.x: I still use 1.x - are there practical problems when upgrading a public website to 2.x?
[13:27:13] <explodes> Why is $.post(url, params).then() not firing? Does it have to do with the fact that the response code is 201, therefore the promise doesn't resolve?
[13:27:25] <BillCriswell> [true, true, false].every(function(bool){ return bool; }); would return false, [true, true, true].every(function(bool){ return bool; }); would return true.
[13:28:04] <ThomasWaldmann> (aside from win xp users with IE are out and idiots who use superceded IE versions < IE9 on later windows also)
[13:30:32] <BillCriswell> stangeland: Actually, you can do: [true, true, false].every(Boolean)
[13:31:51] <BillCriswell> ThomasWaldmann: I think only issues in old IE would pop up.
[13:32:25] <sharax> hi friends
[13:32:29] <stangeland> BillCriswell, oh nice
[13:32:31] <sharax> please help on amchart
[13:33:00] <BillCriswell> stangeland: Still loops under it all, but yeah.
[13:33:14] <stangeland> yeah but thats fine hehe
[13:33:25] <stangeland> out of sight out of mind ;)
[13:34:21] <BillCriswell> stangeland: a .some might be quicker there... but whatever you got the idea.
[13:34:43] <sharax> I want a real-time load data!!!
[13:34:44] <ThomasWaldmann> BillCriswell: thanks. I always like to get feedback from practice as it sometimes differs from docs. :)
[13:34:45] <explodes> So uh... Anyone?
[13:35:04] <BillCriswell> ThomasWaldmann: True.
[13:35:08] <sharax> There are training !!! But I can not comprehend
[13:36:09] <stangeland> BillCriswell, its a very small array
[13:36:14] <stangeland> BillCriswell, 5-10 vals
[13:36:18] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.

[13:39:14] <sharax> friends ...
[13:44:46] <robertmaxrees> sharax open your console yo.
[13:44:50] <robertmaxrees> it tells you what's broken.
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> also, avoid using eval()
[13:46:24] <sharax> live my code :

[13:46:30] <robertmaxrees> look at your console.

[13:47:05] <kinesis> I have a masonry.js problem. Something about the images or web content fully loading and the div panels overlapping and the calculations being off. I've tried document.ready and imagesLoaded but they don't resolve the issue. THe JS is placed at the very end of the script, so all image calculations are done before it executes. I can't figure it out.

[13:50:53] <sharax> view on console
[13:50:56] <robertmaxrees> now it's brojen.
[13:51:39] <iTrace> I'm trying to figure out how to write plugins, and having a difficult time with AJAXed content in my plugin. How can I get this fiddle to work: http://jsfiddle.net/qyavy0gd/1/ I'm just trying to replace text with AJAXED JSON data.
[13:52:01] <sharax> "SyntaxError: missing ] after element list 	  [object Object]" what error ?
[13:52:12] <robertmaxrees> sharax your eval is going to cause big headaches.  why are you using that?
[13:52:38] <explodes> So, jquery is a piece, isn't it.
[13:52:51] <explodes> .then or "success" doesn't get called if there is no response body
[13:52:56] <explodes> Cool library bro
[13:53:12] <sharax> for http://www.amcharts.com/tutorials/using-php-to-hook-up-charts-to-mysql-data-base/!!!
[13:53:19] <Robdgreat> if that's your sole criterion for what makes a "piece", then perhaps
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> explodes if the request has an error of some kind, the done callback for then() won't run.
[13:56:34] <robertmaxrees> the fail callback might though.
[13:58:57] <explodes> there was no error, it was a 201 w/ no response body
[13:59:04] <iTrace> Wait. I got it. So it seems I can only do the DOM minipulation within my AJAX call. Bummer. Is there anyway I can get around that? (here is my updated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/qyavy0gd/2/)
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> explodes depending on what you're doing, that could be an error.  try using .fail() and see what happens.
[14:00:16] <explodes> fail isn't called either.
[14:00:18] <robertmaxrees> iTrace you have to do it within the callback.
[14:00:28] <robertmaxrees> explodes buwh?  then there's something else going on.
[14:00:33] <explodes> yea;
[14:00:40] <robertmaxrees> .done() or .fail() should fun.
[14:00:41] <robertmaxrees> *run
[14:00:47] <explodes> .done gets called
[14:01:00] <explodes> i can check the XHR object itself to see if it was successful;
[14:01:10] <explodes> if response.readyState == 4 and 200 <= response.status < 300
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> wait so what was the issue?
[14:03:34] <shoky> i think it was that jquery is a piece
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:03:49] <robertmaxrees> a piece of what?
[14:03:57] <shoky> a piece of a cool library, bro
[14:04:09] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:04:11] <robertmaxrees> hella
[14:04:28] <explodes> the issue is that neither "success" nor ".then" was called on after a 200+ response came back
[14:04:37] <explodes> I haven't look at jquery yet as to why
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> success is deprecated, so i wouldn't use it.
[14:04:58] <explodes> some people are saying that empty response bodies make *something* break
[14:05:05] <shoky> it's not deprecated i think, the "success" option
[14:05:13] <shoky> just the .success() callback
[14:05:20] <kinesis> What furthers past imagesLoaded and document.ready in jquery/javascript?
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> shoky http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:05:43] <NoiseEee> kinesis: hmmm?
[14:05:59] <explodes> or the deprecated jqXHR.success().
[14:06:06] <shoky> robertmaxrees: yeah, doesn't say it's deprecated
[14:06:17] <explodes> xhr.success is deprecated, not the {success: func} option
[14:06:33] <robertmaxrees> ah that's what you mean.
[14:06:35] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[14:07:43] <shoky> explodes so .done works but not success or .then? sounds highly weird. post some failing code..
[14:08:16] <explodes> http://pastie.org/9726273
[14:09:18] <shoky> this doesn't even have "success" or .then  ..?
[14:09:25] <explodes> woops, sorry, that's the working code
[14:09:44] <explodes> if you replace"complete" with "success" and remove the check against status codes, you get the broken code
[14:10:25] <shoky> and it doesn't call the error callback at all?
[14:10:28] <explodes> no
[14:10:41] <explodes> it does if you send bad form data, though, as expected
[14:12:03] <shoky> are you sure? you put a breakpoint or console log in the error handler?
[14:13:01] <explodes> i'm positive.
[14:14:33] <shoky> what's the 2nd argument to the complete callback?
[14:14:46] <shoky> the argument being passed to it when it's called, i mean
[14:16:42] <explodes> there is only one argument that my callback accepts, but if you mean what it would be as per the api, looking at the jquery source, the "complete" callback args are: jqXHR, statusText
[14:18:00] <shoky> i'm asking, what is the statusText actually being passed to your complete callback
[14:18:28] <shoky> if you add the argument to your ok function
[14:20:11] <dcherman> explodes: what's the value of the "Content-Type" header in your response if one is being set?
[14:20:33] <dcherman> and have you set any type of global `dataType` using $.ajaxSetup or something
[14:20:45] <explodes> let me see, and no
[14:22:15] <explodes> well.
[14:22:20] <explodes> application/hyper+json; charset=utf-8
[14:23:19] <dcherman> explodes: that's why.  it's matching the /json/ regexp in ajax, so it's treating the response as JSON
[14:23:21] <dcherman> "" is not valid JSON
[14:23:42] <shoky> then his error callback should be called, though
[14:23:43] <dcherman> use dataType: 'text' and it'll override that if you want.  or sent back `null` or something in the response
[14:23:47] <dcherman> ah, it's not?
[14:23:50] <dcherman> missed that.
[14:23:56] <shoky> he says nope
[14:24:26] <explodes> the source has no regex match against /json/ i think that i was incorrect when i said "error" wasn't being called
[14:24:31] <explodes> let me run the bad code
[14:24:31] <shoky> also he says .done IS being called
[14:25:16] <explodes> .error is being called
[14:25:19] <shoky> :\
[14:25:20] <explodes> jquery is not a piece, i'm a piece
[14:29:06] <explodes> .error didn't appear to be called because i displayed an error message on .error, but the message was just the response body, ergo an empty string was put on the string so it didn't look like an error happened; solid;
[14:29:45] <explodes> however, since we are using hyper+json, is there a way to add that as a content-type that should be parsed as json?
[14:29:50] <shoky> hence i asked "are you sure? you put a breakpoint or console log in the error handler?"
[14:30:08] <explodes> :I
[14:30:53] <shoky> you can put dataType: 'json'  if it's valid json
[14:31:52] <explodes> is there a way to add "application/hyper+json" globally?
[14:33:38] <shoky> i think dcherman was right about the /json/ regexp
[14:33:48] <shoky> so you should be set..

[15:08:27] <kinesis> I have a masonry.js problem. Something about the images or web content fully loading and the div panels overlapping and the calculations being off. I've tried document.ready and imagesLoaded but they don't resolve the issue. THe JS is placed at the very end of the script, so all image calculations are done before it executes. I can't figure it out. Desandro talks about imagesLoaded and why images throw off the calculations in the appendix of his site, but after
[15:15:55] <TheHackOps> I found jQuery a few months ago
[15:16:01] <TheHackOps> And i can say
[15:16:02] <TheHackOps> THANKYOU
[15:16:21] <TheHackOps> I have made so many super cool things with it
[15:23:44] <robertmaxrees> helluva day
[15:39:03] <kinesis> how do I run a few strings of  jquery or javascript code after ALL other JS in the document is done and the images are finished rendering?
[15:39:27] <kinesis> I have imagesLoaded, but that's not enough.. I thikn there is a pesky JS loading too that is making my masonry.js layout borders overlap
[15:40:03] <TheHackOps> kinesis, Put the jQuery script at the end of your HTML file
[15:40:07] <Jattenalle> KindOne, $(window].load()
[15:40:12] <TheHackOps> and that
[15:40:14] <Jattenalle> err, $(window).load();
[15:40:24] <Jattenalle> putting it at the end won't help TheEternalAbyss
[15:40:29] <Jattenalle> sorry, TheHackOps
[15:42:42] <kinesis> i tried that.. it doesn't work
[15:42:55] <robertmaxrees> kinesis share your code?
[15:43:03] <kinesis> Yeah I put $(window).load(function() { (masonry stuff) }); at the end of my footer
[15:43:13] <kinesis> ok
[15:44:08] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/arexln1wowzgrx8hghpla
[15:44:43] <robertmaxrees> are you able to make a functioning, broken example in a jsfiddle?
[15:44:55] <kinesis> I don't know. its a huge wordpress page
[15:45:14] <robertmaxrees> small, self-contained examples are usually best when tracking problems down.
[15:45:23] <robertmaxrees> if you can recreate the bug outside of the page, that's one thing.
[15:45:33] <robertmaxrees> if it's only in your environment, there's something else going on.
[15:47:23] <kinesis> id have to generate like 10 divs
[15:47:41] <kinesis> I guess.. it would be a small project.. and to emulate the problem im having with the divs overlapping.. is tough
[15:48:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bz0megxa/ here you go.
[15:48:03] <robertmaxrees> 10 divs.
[15:48:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:48:20] <kinesis> i would find challenge in reproducing this error
[15:48:27] <kinesis> it involves many plugins and rendered php content
[15:48:47] <robertmaxrees> the idea of the self-contained example is that you only provide the minimal stuff to get the bug to show up.
[15:49:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's very difficult for us to help you
[15:49:18] <kinesis> Hmm.
[15:49:28] <kinesis> yeah i see that from your perspective
[15:54:56] <kinesis> maybe desandro knows. he says to call masonry.layout() after : caused by unloaded media: images, web fonts, embedded buttons.
[15:55:15] <kinesis> I have a ratingwidget plugin that has some kind of strange button tied to it.
[16:00:13] <xibalba> i'm trying to get a div to appear and disappear on click; here's a gist. can you guys take a look? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d1783455129f3677c0a4
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).data('expanded') == "yes") {
[16:01:00] <robertmaxrees> everywhere else you use true/false
[16:01:31] <xibalba> it flies off the page immediately
[16:01:40] <hellier> If I have a string "lots of     white space", i want to trim the extra spaces, so it becomes "lots of white space".
[16:01:51] <hellier> .replace(/\s*/g, " "); this makes it "l o t s o f ...", any help? :(
[16:02:00] <hellier> can't wrap my head around it
[16:02:16] <robertmaxrees> xibalba could you create an example on a jsfiddle?
[16:02:22] <xibalba> I can try
[16:02:35] <hellier> .replace(/\s */g, " "); baha, this was it :)
[16:02:47] <hellier> always after i ask for help, it comes to me
[16:04:17] <robertmaxrees> hellier that's not exactly what you want.
[16:04:41] <hellier> oh? Well it works. :/
[16:04:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:04:48] <kinesis> how do i do something like imagesLoaded in respect to : webfonts and embedded buttons, robert?
[16:05:11] <robertmaxrees> that's usually terrible reasoning, hellier :) .replace(/\s+/g, ' ') is closer to what you want.
[16:05:19] <robertmaxrees> kinesis no clue.
[16:05:37] <hellier> http://jsfiddle.net/28vma52c/
[16:05:45] <hellier> ah ty
[16:06:03] <robertmaxrees> hellier foo = 'lots   of          white   space';
[16:06:03] <robertmaxrees> console.log(foo.replace(/\s+/g, " "));
[16:06:11] <robertmaxrees> woops http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/28vma52c/2/
[16:06:15] <robertmaxrees> use console.log()
[16:06:29] <xibalba> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/kzjxm1og/
[16:06:31] <xibalba> thanks
[16:06:38] <xibalba> fyi , brand new to this
[16:07:06] <robertmaxrees> xibalba nothing on there has the class .expandable-info
[16:07:06] <hellier> xibalba you don't have jquery selected
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> so that click handler won't work.
[16:07:19] <xibalba> yeah, fixing that
[16:07:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kzjxm1og/2/ with jquery included
[16:08:36] <xibalba> looks like this is working, http://jsfiddle.net/kzjxm1og/3/
[16:09:02] <robertmaxrees> if ($(this).data('ff-expanded') == "yes") {
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't work because you're using true/false everywhere else.
[16:10:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kzjxm1og/4/
[16:10:29] <xibalba> ok going to compare these
[16:10:49] <robertmaxrees> i just removed your comparison because == "yes" was never going to work.
[16:11:39] <Freman> Is there any way to proxy event's (on) from one event emitter to another (ie, obja emits "foo", it automatically gets emitteed by parent/wrapper objb?)
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> Freman wut
[16:12:15] <xibalba> ok thanks
[16:12:24] <robertmaxrees> Freman clarify?
[16:12:26] <xibalba> now i've got a good example, trying to see why it's not working in my app
[16:13:05] <Freman> I have an object that emits a dozen different events, it's being managed by another object, I don't want to have to manually add a bunch of obja.on('foo', function() {self.emit('foo');});
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> xibalba btw you have an addClass() in the else, but no removeClass() in the if
[16:13:31] <xibalba> k
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> Freman i'd structure the app differently in that case.
[16:13:55] <robertmaxrees> call the functions directly instead of calling event emitters.
[16:14:52] <Freman> obja is a library that's used elsewhere in the app for different purposes)
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused, then.  are you asking for jquery help or obja help?
[16:16:09] <Freman> obja is just an object I've made
[16:17:08] <xibalba> this is closer to what i'm working with, http://jsfiddle.net/rao0fcjj/1/
[16:17:19] <xibalba> i didn't think that <i> was making any difference
[16:22:42] <xibalba> i'm totally lost on this
[16:27:01] * xibalba face palms
[16:27:01] <xibalba> got it
[17:02:25] <Skizu> Hey, can I get a quick hand, just using ids as a "page changer" looking to highlight the link that I selected, not sure which method to use, can you give me a hand and give us a link?
[17:03:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:06:33] <spudzee> Is there any way to force trigger .mouseenter()? Like, without actually having your mouse over the thing?
[17:06:50] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('mouseenter')
[17:06:59] <spudzee> let me try that
[17:07:02] <robertmaxrees> or call the callback directly instead.
[17:07:05] <robertmaxrees> which is the smarter way to do that.
[17:07:16] <spudzee> for what I'm doing, that is not really an option
[17:07:25] <robertmaxrees> why isthat?
[17:07:46] <spudzee> I'm experiencing a bug with my website...
[17:07:50] <spudzee> I have a menu
[17:07:58] <spudzee> the little three bars type menu
[17:10:21] <spudzee> when I click on it, it will bring out the menu (duh). The menu will push the three bars to right and 'MENU' will appear somewhat close to where the three bars were. I have code on my menu, that when you hover over the items in it, say 'HOME' or 'ABOUT' or whatever...
[17:10:54] <spudzee> it will will change the color of the area around the text. It does this when you hover over 'MENU' as well
[17:11:07] <robertmaxrees> none of that really changes anything.
[17:11:12] <spudzee> hold on
[17:11:16] <robertmaxrees> you should be able to abstract out the callback and call it directly.
[17:11:19] <spudzee> let me finish explaining this
[17:12:42] <spudzee> by definition, whenever you click the three bars and the menu comes out, you will be hovering over 'MENU'. So it should change color, but it doesn't. Probably because of how I coded it
[17:14:23] <spudzee> I tried putting the code to change its color within the ('#MENU').click() function, but it creates more problems than it causes. So I was wondering if force triggering mouseenter would solve this the easy way
[17:14:56] <spudzee> *creates more problems than it solves
[17:16:04] <spudzee> anyways... I'll try this
[17:18:03] <BryanRuiz> whats a pretty notation for getting a json object
[17:18:15] <BryanRuiz> something like: var shoppingCart = $.get(prefix + "/default/ecard/index/getCartContents", "json");
[17:19:06] <BillCriswell> BryanRuiz: There's a $.getJSON('/url')
[17:19:23] <BryanRuiz> thanks BillCriswell, ill look at it now
[17:20:03] <BryanRuiz> seems like that returns a jqXHR object too
[17:20:14] <BryanRuiz> i was hoping for a function to return the json object
[17:20:21] <BryanRuiz> whatever, no biggie
[17:20:36] <BillCriswell> BryanRuiz: The callback would be the json object.
[17:21:12] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON('/cart', function (cart) { /* Do what you need with cart */ });
[17:21:49] <spudzee> var problem = fixed;
[17:22:22] <BillCriswell> Should actually probably use $.getJSON('/cart').done(function (cart) { /* Do what you want with cart */ });
[17:22:51] <Besan> http://jsbin.com/wicaba/1/
[17:23:02] <Besan> Take a look please
[17:23:37] <Besan> How to alert when new item was added and highlight the <li> until touch
[17:23:55] <kinesis> how would i call jquery after each image on the screen in a .single_post class div loads (an event for each one fuly loading)
[17:24:32] <BillCriswell> kinesis: http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/ might be useful.
[17:24:37] <kinesis> I have that
[17:25:04] <kinesis> i have to load a whole gallery and resizing the div after they all load makes it look ugly to the user
[17:25:20] <kinesis> can i do it for each one respectively?
[17:26:46] <BryanRuiz> thanks BillCriswell
[17:27:09] <BillCriswell> kinesis: It looks like you want the progress callback.
[17:27:13] <BillCriswell> BryanRuiz: No problem.
[17:28:31] <kinesis> Got it
[17:29:02] <kinesis> Progress callback?
[17:29:10] <Besan> BillCriswell , seems like you're the hero here. can you please take a look at my jsbin?
[17:29:15] <kinesis> Is that able to call msnry.layout() as the image loads progress?
[17:29:28] <BillCriswell> Besan: I don't mess around with jQuery Mobile enough to be helpful.
[17:29:29] <kinesis> I think what I have is good enough :)
[17:29:35] <obert> need a Gallery
[17:29:45] <Besan> Got it :)
[17:29:57] <obert> any tips?
[17:31:12] <kinesis> how can i sniff for new img objects in the prop..  There is this ratingwidget that breaks masonry.js.  I want to detect when these delayed objects load and run msnry.layout() too
[17:31:51] <kinesis> They seem to load outside of my detectable range of $(window).load, Font loading, etc.. some kind of embedded buttons
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> you can use mutation observers if you want to get weird.
[17:33:22] <kinesis> nevermind it didnt work.
[17:36:11] <kinesis> Bill:What are progress callbacks?
[17:36:43] <BillCriswell> kinesis: http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/
[17:36:53] <BillCriswell> Control + F -> "progress"
[17:40:21] <BryanRuiz> hmm
[17:41:26] <BryanRuiz> im having a bit of a hard time understanding callbacks, im trying to get a value outside of the callback into the parent function that $.getJSON is called in but the callback is not sequential in the code
[17:41:47] <BryanRuiz> does that make sense?
[17:41:57] <robertmaxrees> that won't work the way you want it to.
[17:42:31] <Ansikt> BryanRuiz, Can you paste some code?
[17:43:09] <BryanRuiz> http://pastebin.com/aea2zSw4
[17:43:17] <BryanRuiz> im trying to get it to return books
[17:43:33] <BryanRuiz> but at the time of returning books, it isnt modified yet
[17:43:38] <BryanRuiz> because the callback happens later
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:43:52] <robertmaxrees> because it's async
[17:44:10] <BryanRuiz> so what do i have to do, rethink how this program is written?
[17:44:32] <robertmaxrees> basically :) you need to abstract out the code that relies on that variable being set and instead pass that in explicitly.
[17:45:58] <BryanRuiz> i could shut off async
[17:46:07] <robertmaxrees> and then watch the browser lock up ;)
[17:46:08] <Ansikt> No
[17:46:11] <Ansikt> NOOOOOOOOOO'
[17:46:12] <robertmaxrees> exactly the opposite of what you want to do.
[17:46:17] <BryanRuiz> :-p
[17:46:56] <Ansikt> Basically, you just need to put everything which runs after the callback into the callback.  IF things depend on this method, then make it async too
[17:47:35] <Ansikt> (also, I don't really know what you're trying to do, but those nested each calls seem to be a bit of code smell to me)
[17:48:52] <BryanRuiz> thanks guys
[17:51:44] <Ansikt> If I were writing your api, I would make getUnlinkedBookCounts return a $.Deferred which gets resolved with the value of "books".
[17:52:32] <BryanRuiz> that last statement i dont get
[17:53:10] <BryanRuiz> let me look up deferred
[17:55:05] <Ansikt> Basically, you can create your own semi-promises, which would make this method async.
[17:59:34] <calamity> Supposing I have a website, (site A) that contains an iframe to site B and I need to read the page contents of B into A. They are *different origins* but I can insert a secondary iframe onto B. How might I pass the data 'upwards' to site A?
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:04:15] <calamity> ... website A has an iframe which contains website B. I want to pass the page contents of B to A. I can add a script into B, if necessary.
[18:06:44] <Ansikt> calamity, You...can't really.  There are cross origin restrictions for precisely this reason.
[18:07:36] <obert> none?
[18:07:40] <Ansikt> calamity, If they're both subdomains, you can set something (window.host I think?) to be the same and then they'll pass.
[18:08:09] <calamity> Hrm. It's kind of weird, the XO restriction makes a lot of sense if I was trying to change site B, but I'm only trying to read it... which I can already do with my own eyes.
[18:08:23] <calamity> and the fact that I have partial access to site B is of no use?
[18:08:30] <Ansikt> If you don't care about raw JS objects, you could always just create a bunch of images pointing to somewhere on your domain - put a bunch of info in the query parameters for those images and thereby serialize data across.
[18:09:20] <calamity> Ansikt, I'm willing to try anything at the point. Do you mean images as in... pictures?
[18:09:58] <Ansikt> Yeah.  So, what I mean is - let's say there's some field you care about on site B - maybe it's a div with an id of "foo"
[18:10:07] <calamity> yep.
[18:10:32] <calamity> that's pretty much the case :p
[18:11:07] <Ansikt> you could do something along the lines of $(document.body).append('<img src="' + encodeURIComponent($('#foo').text()) +  '"');
[18:11:52] <calamity> Ansikt, so that would create an image that has the source as... some text?
[18:11:53] <Ansikt> $(document.body).append('<img src="siteA.com/foodata/' + encodeURIComponent($('#foo').text()) +  '" />');
[18:12:17] <Ansikt> right, but it needs to point to some area on your site
[18:13:11] <Ansikt> so, then you'd write a little node app or something on site a that listens to requests to the foodata/(.*?) endpoint and then save that data.  Or something.
[18:14:08] <calamity> hrm. pretty clever...
[18:14:36] <Ansikt> Also, it's probably unethical to do this unless you are / have permission from both site's owners.  So, don't do it if so.
[18:15:26] <calamity> fair enough
[18:15:28] <Ansikt> And if you DO have control of both sites, you could just set up CORS and make XHR requests, which would probably be easier
[18:16:16] <calamity> Oh? that sounds useful.
[18:17:34] <calamity> Cors is... server side? or implemented as a client side script?
[18:17:41] <robertmaxrees> server-side
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> your server has to say that those requests are kosher
[18:18:08] <Ansikt> They're just server headers which tell your browser to ignore the cross origin restrictions for certain domains
[18:19:28] <calamity> fair enough
[18:35:52] <wroathe> ls
[19:23:12] <t4nk106> i am working on a problem from last 10 hours . not finding the solution
[19:23:41] <t4nk106> actually clearInterval() not working
[19:23:49] <t4nk106> can i show you code
[19:26:36] <t4nk106> do anybody knows about clearInterval()
[19:26:37] <t4nk106> ?
[19:27:48] <kevin> hey so this is sloppy.. is there a better way to do this? $(".filedrag").parent().find(".filesize").hide().end().end().hide()
[19:28:28] <kevin> of course can use vars and what not but was wondering if theres some simplistic chained statement i can use
[19:32:51] <BillCriswell> t4nk106: Yes.
[19:33:22] <BillCriswell> kevin: the second .end() seems extraneous?
[19:34:58] <kevin> BillCriswell: the first end() pops the find(.filesize") and the second end() pops the parent(), so i'm back at original $(".filedrag") ... i basically need to hide .filedrag and .filesize that's contained elsewhere within its parent
[19:37:41] <BillCriswell> I'd need to see it all in action.
[19:54:43] <jeffreylevesque> could someone suggest me  GPL license to implement on my repository?
