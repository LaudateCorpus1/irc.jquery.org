[01:35:59] <Whiskey> Cork: i try to do like you did lastday whit to add it twice insted of write the code twice
[01:36:07] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/14/ <--- you see how the first table above looks
[01:36:41] <Cork> again what is going wrong
[01:37:40] <Whiskey> you don´t see the first and second one? in not look the same
[01:38:04] <Whiskey> $("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr:nth-child(-n02)").not(':last').after("\ <-- try to insert the code inside it twice before last tr and after first tr

[02:28:09] <serengeor> Hello, I'm using datepicker options 'minDate' and 'maxDate'. They work fine unless the date in the picker is out of range of those dates.
[02:28:44] <serengeor> If I set min, max values after invalid date is set, then datepicker updates the date in the field to min or max value.
[02:29:17] <serengeor> But I don't want that to happen, is there a way to stop jquery from updating the date in field but keep restraints on callendar?
[02:43:50] <serengeor> Here's fiddle of what I just tried explaining: http://jsfiddle.net/ebq29rw8/1/

[03:05:13] <JosefDe> Hi guys. What is best practice for validating a form which contains multiple input fields?
[03:05:18] <JosefDe> At the moment I'm iterating over each input
[03:09:41] <Whiskey> Cork: i manage to add it as i like in here http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/15/ but if you look at the source it add 2 empty tr>td why? http://pastebin.com/udbvn47B

[03:33:40] <Gurb> Hi people! sombody expert in deferred objects?
[03:33:56] <Uhkis> of course
[03:34:51] <Gurb> hi Uhkis , i hope you could help me? sorry for my english first of all ;)
[03:36:32] <Gurb> i have a problem with a function that returns a deferred object: when i call it for first time, it executes de .done functios as expected, but when i'll do it again, th .done function don't happend
[03:37:33] <Gurb> i tested than the state reinits to "pending" at the second call, but it not resolve
[04:06:49] <printForever> is there a way to add >> data-modal-tab="office" via jQuery attr?
[04:07:25] <printForever> I have an <a> tag, that I need to add data-modal-tab to it.
[04:07:36] <printForever> What would be the best way to do it?
[04:10:33] <Cork> printForever: if you just want to have access to it from jquery just use .data('modal-tab', 'office')
[04:10:58] <Cork> if you need it to actually be an attribute on the element use .attr('data-modal-tab', 'office')
[04:11:11] <Whiskey> Cork: did you see my example ?
[04:11:15] <printForever> I tried that, but it wasnt in the code
[04:11:31] <printForever> thanks Cork, I will try to debug my problem
[04:11:39] <Whiskey> Cork: jQuery plays some stupid games whit me :D
[04:23:21] <`ULTzZz> Hi I have made a function and this is working: selectProducts();
[04:23:21] <`ULTzZz>     $(".tb_radio_row").change(selectProducts);
[04:23:43] <`ULTzZz> can someone tell me why onload we need () and .change without the () ?
[04:31:54] <Cork> ULT: cause func() executes it func sends it as a reference
[04:31:56] <shoky_> ULT:  selectProducts()  calls the function right away.
[04:33:00] <Cork> ULT: behind the seen this is what happens: function change(callback) { callback() } change(selectProducts);
[04:33:50] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/16/ improved the code but it still adds empty trs and i don´t think its can be fixed ether
[04:34:02] <ULT> aah, thanks guys. That makes it clear.
[04:34:49] <Cork> ULT: don't take the code i wrote there literally, it is much more complex (and async) then the example
[04:34:57] <Cork> but the effect for how the function works is the same
[04:35:31] <ULT> yes. makes alot understandable.
[04:48:05] <Whiskey> Im stuck the tr can´t be removed
[04:49:39] <Whiskey> hmm strange
[04:49:58] <Whiskey> Cork: this seems to do it, $("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr").eq(0).clone().insertBefore("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr:last");
[04:50:08] <Whiskey> :D
[04:57:26] <Nephro> Hi. I am fiddling with libraries and js and am working with an html file with no server. Just double clicking on it. Trying to jQuery to a service I run on localhost but get the "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" error. How do I fix this?
[04:58:01] <Cork> Nephro: the server you run on localhost need to set a cors header
[04:58:12] <Cork> for null if i remember correctly
[05:01:00] <Nephro> Cork, thanks, it worked. Weird thing. I fixed up the server but forgot to launch it back, and got the error again. Once the server was launched, no error. Can't understand then on which side does it occur.
[05:01:35] <Cork> Nephro: the error happens client side, cause the server doesn't say it allows it
[05:01:47] <Cork> the answer is cached too
[05:02:19] <Nephro> I understand, thank you :)
[06:18:13] <cordovafan8> Hello. I've got a question about the DataTables plugin. If I am looking to set a table up to do an ajax.reload(), can I also define a custom ajax parameter of the "ajax": function(data, callback, settings) {}  form?
[06:20:55] <cordovafan8> basically what I want to do is do some processing of the returned ajax data before the table is redrawn
[06:49:17] <crisumi> If I have a header div below a navigation bar at the top of my page, and there's a logo centered horizontal/vertical in this header div (kind of tall) -- how can i get the logo to move and shrink to the top left of the nav bar
[06:49:32] <crisumi> would i make a path the nfollow on scroll? seems like the path would change based on the screen size
[06:58:00] <jalnt> Anyone here used jquery ui much?
[06:58:04] <DeltaHeavy> I have a select box I want to run some code when a manually changes it's value. I also need to programatically change its value but I don't want said code to run from the event handler. What's the best way to go about this? I can think of a few but they're seem kind of messy.
[06:59:30] <jalnt> Sounds similar to my question DeltaHeavy..
[07:00:16] <jalnt> I have a jQuery UI slider that has multiple handles, and I want to be able to add new handles to it by clicking an "add" button
[07:00:47] <jalnt> I can add values to the slider's values property, but it doesn't update in the view
[07:01:05] <DeltaHeavy> Doing this: if (typeof event.originalEvent !== 'undefined') { return false; }
[07:01:38] <DeltaHeavy> jalnt: Reinitialize the widget with new options.
[07:02:31] <DeltaHeavy> === 'undefined'
[07:03:59] <jalnt> DeltaHeavy: You mean like, call $("#my-slider").slider() again?
[07:04:11] <DeltaHeavy> Yes
[07:04:20] <jalnt> I think I tried doing that...
[07:04:52] <jalnt> I'll keep that in mind and try it
[07:11:27] <DeltaHeavy> jalnt: You might need to destroy/remove the instance first.
[07:48:55] <Diplomat> Hey guys, I have a quick question. I'm appending an element during "beforeunload" event. Everything works fine in chrome, but in firefox that request dies (I can see it the inspector, but it's gray and request isn't sent out). It also works in IE, but I'm not sure why it doesn't work in Firefox. Any ideas?
[07:49:25] <Diplomat> Also "onunload" doesn't work for firefox
[07:50:19] <jorvis> Should JSON data returned from .ajax calls always be key/value pairs rather than actual arrays?  I'm trying to iterate over this (sent from python) and can't seem to:  http://pastie.org/10454237
[08:05:55] <shoky> jorvis: any valid json data is fine
[08:21:30] <Noob_> Can anyone help me?  I'm trying to take a field as I'm typing in it and replace the spaces with _ in a second textbox.
[08:24:15] <shoky> Noob_: make a jsfiddle of what you've tried
[08:25:06] <Noob_> I haven't tried anything yet as I didn't know how to tell jquery to watch the field constantly.  I'm not very good with jquery
[08:25:50] <shoky> you do that with an event handler. in this case you can use the "keypress" event on the first field
[08:26:12] <Noob_> okay.  Thanks shoky.  I will start working on that now.
[08:26:37] <shoky> e.g.  $('#myinput').on('change', function(e) { ... this.value is the current text in the field ... })
[08:27:31] <shoky> (that assumes you have a <input id="myinput"> in the document)
[08:27:50] <shoky> oops i meant .on('keypress', ..
[08:27:55] <shoky> not change
[08:29:54] <Sudheer> Hi. I need to implement a popover kind of thing when user clicks on some options. would jquery help in this case? please click on login (top right) in this link http://mapjam.com/wxvqfqq
[08:34:00] <Noob_> shoky it doesn't seem to work. https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/z84mndaL/
[08:34:30] <duch_kazatel> usually helps if you include jquery
[08:34:52] <duch_kazatel> also: var - https://jsfiddle.net/z84mndaL/1/
[08:34:58] <Noob_> WOW, thanks
[08:35:24] <Sudheer> could anyone help me in this? http://mapjam.com/wxvqfqq
[08:35:34] <duch_kazatel> Sudheer uh...
[08:35:37] <duch_kazatel> with a map?
[08:35:38] <Sudheer> please click on signup/login in this link
[08:35:50] <Sudheer> or click on personalize on left
[08:36:04] <Sudheer> I need to put login in similar way
[08:36:07] <duch_kazatel> Sudheer not seeing either of those :)
[08:36:24] <Noob_> So that works, but I was hoping that it would update it while they were typing and not requiring them hit enter.
[08:36:24] <Sudheer> please go to mapjam.com
[08:36:36] <Sudheer> enter some location say New York
[08:36:43] <duch_kazatel> Noob_ use the input event
[08:37:17] <duch_kazatel> Sudheer so what part of this do you need?
[08:37:40] <Sudheer> I should implement both. I am going to start with login
[08:37:47] <duch_kazatel> both what?
[08:37:48] <duch_kazatel> a login form?
[08:37:55] <Noob_> duch_kazatel thanks for the help, it fixed it.
[08:38:30] <duch_kazatel> Sudheer or are you talking about the animation?
[08:38:38] <Sudheer> login on right, and personalize kind of options on left
[08:38:58] <duch_kazatel> okay - what about that do you need help with?
[08:39:00] <Sudheer> isn't it a popover?
[08:39:25] <duch_kazatel> it could be done a variety of says.  that's just some good ol' css.
[08:39:30] <Sudheer> how can I implement things like that?
[08:39:58] <Sudheer> can I use jquery for the same
[08:40:08] <duch_kazatel> http://callmenick.com/post/slide-and-push-menus-with-css3-transitions
[08:40:11] <duch_kazatel> it's all css.
[08:41:17] <Sudheer> awesome.
[08:41:51] <Sudheer> thats what I was looking for
[08:41:59] <Sudheer> I need to add some animations for left menu
[08:42:07] <Sudheer> like personalize in the map
[09:01:19] <kirua> why this doesn't work : http://pastebin.com/TQZ5A2rC with .row being a div, i get "TypeError: $(...).prepend(...) is not a function"
[09:03:24] <shoky> kirua:   you have   $( ".row" ).prepend()(...)
[09:11:40] <decx> double elipsises what does it mean
[09:17:01] <eminencehc> I am trying to take an array given to me by an ajax request, and parse it into options that can be put into a select field. Would someone mind looking at my gist and helping me out with the missing step? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/e85538de1f02923c1968
[09:20:18] <duch_kazatel> stringify the array and show us that.,
[09:23:10] <eminencehc> duch_kazatel: I added the stringified array to the gist.
[09:25:19] <duch_kazatel> so i'm confused about what you need - how do you turn these into select options?
[09:25:31] <duch_kazatel> where the 0th index of each item is the text and the 1st is the value?
[09:26:01] <eminencehc> duch_kazatel: Yeah thats right. I want to populate a select field with those options
[09:26:13] <duch_kazatel> so what have you tried so far?
[09:27:35] <eminencehc> duch_kazatel: Well I was confused at what type of array I was trying to parse first off, I think now that I have a stringified array I can make more sense of it.
[09:27:47] <duch_kazatel> "type of array"?  it's an array :)
[09:27:56] <duch_kazatel> fwiw this is a great use for .map();
[09:27:57] <eminencehc> var options = [];
[09:27:57] <eminencehc>                     data.each(function (key, index) {
[09:27:57] <eminencehc>                         options.push({text: index, value: key});
[09:27:59] <eminencehc>                     });
[09:28:00] <duch_kazatel> woah
[09:28:01] <eminencehc>                     $('.goal').empty().append(options);
[09:28:03] <eminencehc> oops sorry for paste
[09:28:07] <eminencehc> forgot it did that
[09:28:10] <duch_kazatel> yeah, use a map.
[09:29:20] <eminencehc> duch_kazatel: Cool Ill play around with that, thanks.
[09:29:47] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/rjttLgao/
[09:30:16] <duch_kazatel> basically, any time you're creating an array and then using a forEach() to push things into it, you actually want a .map().  single operation.
[09:36:52] <cjbaezilla> hello guys, may i ask something? :)
[09:36:56] <duch_kazatel> NO
[09:36:58] <eminencehc> duch_kazatel: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
[09:36:59] <cjbaezilla> haha
[09:37:02] <cjbaezilla> (Y)
[09:37:14] <duch_kazatel> cjwelborn this is IRC - what are you doing NOT idling?
[09:37:39] <cjbaezilla> haha
[09:37:48] <eminencehc> someone else just got an interesting ping..
[09:37:57] <duch_kazatel> hahaha woops.
[09:37:58] <cjbaezilla> i dont even know you and i already feel...
[09:38:05] <duch_kazatel> cjbaezilla anyway - so what's up?
[09:38:23] <cjbaezilla> well, first of all sorry bout my english, it's not my native
[09:38:29] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[09:39:32] <cjbaezilla> this is about google forms and cors
[09:39:38] <Kamuela> the number of people who speak english passably makes me feel dumb for ONLY speaking english
[09:39:45] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela++
[09:40:03] <duch_kazatel> cjbaezilla alright - just ask your question :)
[09:40:37] <cjbaezilla> well the thing is, that it works on both FF and chrome, but in chrome it breaks the script because of cors
[09:40:49] <duch_kazatel> what works/breaks?
[09:40:57] <duch_kazatel> some code for context would be helpful.
[09:41:14] <cjbaezilla> works: sending the data and storing it, breaks: the CB i guess
[09:41:17] <cjbaezilla> one minute
[09:41:21] <cjbaezilla> jsfiddle right?
[09:41:25] <duch_kazatel> sure
[09:41:44] <cjbaezilla> give me a sec, im not used to computers
[09:41:48] <cjbaezilla> NOOOOT
[09:41:50] <cjbaezilla> haha
[09:41:54] <cjbaezilla> 1 sec sorry
[09:43:47] <cjbaezilla> this is the function http://pastebin.com/0L4LXYvB
[09:44:16] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[09:44:21] <cjbaezilla> in chrome the script finish, applying the style
[09:44:31] <cjbaezilla> sorry in FF it finish, in chrome not
[09:44:40] <cjbaezilla> both send the dat and store them
[09:44:59] <cjbaezilla> but chrome doesnt continue to the responses 0 or 200
[09:45:05] <duch_kazatel> why are you using statusCode and not .done()/.fail() ?
[09:45:06] <cjbaezilla> both browsers complains about cors
[09:45:30] <cjbaezilla> kinda copy/paste, already try that too, but it has the same result
[09:46:12] <cjbaezilla> i prefer to use that $.ajax block because the examples were like that
[09:47:33] <duch_kazatel> what examples?
[09:47:40] <cjbaezilla> give me a sec
[09:48:11] <cjbaezilla> https://wiki.base22.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=72942000
[09:48:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you really want to use .done() and .fail() - not sure why this is using statusCode.
[09:49:21] <cjbaezilla> ok, i'll make the changes now and try again :)
[09:49:27] <duch_kazatel> also: CORS errors are not surprising.  you're not supposed to hit that endpoint with AJAX iirc.
[09:49:33] <cjbaezilla> 'll perform some debug too
[09:49:41] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: i found the slotion today :)
[09:50:09] <Whiskey> for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {$("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr").eq(0).clone().insertBefore("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr:last");} :=)
[09:51:21] <cjbaezilla> i'll back in a moment, thank you duch_kazatel
[09:54:04] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey huh?
[09:54:55] <duch_kazatel> so you wanted to copy some TRs?
[09:58:52] <Whiskey> yeh, it works perfect
[09:59:08] <Whiskey> and don´t add extra tr as it does on the other way
[10:02:33] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: is it possible to clone it again, and add a new row next to filesize? http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/19/
[10:02:46] <lalalaaa> Hi! How come I can't use https://github.com/gregjacobs/Autolinker.js/ like this? http://jsfiddle.net/jc4gLwf0/
[10:02:54] <Whiskey> yeh its just to clone a td :D
[10:04:09] <Whiskey> something like $("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr > td").eq(0).clone().insertBefore("table.FileInfo > tbody > td:last");
[10:04:55] <cjbaezilla> well, same result...so i decided to use the .always CB, end of the matter haha
[10:05:41] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i really need you to come up with a more simple fiddle.
[10:05:49] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: :D its simple
[10:05:53] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[10:06:00] <duch_kazatel> it's convoluted and not clear about what you're asking :)
[10:06:16] <lalalaaa> that is definitely NOT simple :-)
[10:06:52] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa because autolinker is expecting a string.
[10:07:09] <lalalaaa> Whiskey: .nfo and .sfv lol what are u up to
[10:07:18] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: ah i see..
[10:07:53] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: im working on it
[10:08:19] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey you keep approaching problems in the context of your code - approach the problem separately first and then learn how to apply the solution.
[10:12:22] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: this is gonna be ugly..
[10:12:30] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: you see that example above in the first element on the html, add 3 new rows the the one under. Most be possible to clone it
[10:12:31] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa why are you adding links via js?
[10:12:32] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/20/
[10:12:46] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey uh, wat?
[10:13:15] <duch_kazatel> learn.jquery.com - your traversal is WAY hacky.
[10:13:54] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: whats your problem, do you see the 2 elements in the html its 2 tables
[10:14:05] <Whiskey> i try to add 3 rows to the second table whit clone as the one above
[10:14:08] <Whiskey> its really clear
[10:14:10] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: well really its just so the user can do immediate / optimistic posting kinda like what you see on facebook.. im also autolinking via server-side though
[10:14:19] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey i see a really convoluted and complex fiddle.
[10:14:38] <Whiskey> don´t look at the html crap
[10:14:43] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[10:14:45] <duch_kazatel> i kind of have to.
[10:14:48] <duch_kazatel> that's apart of jquery.
[10:14:49] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:15:00] <Whiskey> then it will be alot more complicated then it is
[10:15:10] <PurePandemonium> It might be more complicated than you think it is
[10:15:11] <lalalaaa> Whiskey: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ is a must-read imho
[10:16:04] <lalalaaa> sorry i need to mind my own business
[10:16:17] <lalalaaa> you've probably already read it as well
[10:16:50] <PurePandemonium> Nah, that's a pretty good resource. Reduce the problem as simply as you can, but no simpler.
[10:17:30] <Whiskey> :P
[10:17:50] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: $("table.FileInfo > tbody > tr > td").eq(0).clone().insertBefore("table.FileInfo > tbody > td") <-- something like that to add 3 more tds to that table
[10:19:02] <Whiskey> maybe can´t be done as the tds are instede the tr
[10:19:40] <lalalaaa> PurePandemonium: true true
[10:19:44] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: yay http://jsfiddle.net/jc4gLwf0/1/
[10:21:05] <PurePandemonium> Whiskey: What are you trying to accomplish?
[10:21:54] <lalalaaa> or http://jsfiddle.net/jc4gLwf0/2/ rather
[10:22:05] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/21/ something like that, but its applayed wrong in the html now
[10:24:40] <lalalaaa> Whiskey: i think you've lost him lol
[10:25:11] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: i try to do http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/18/ as the $("table.FileInfo tr:nth-child(-n03)").append("\ does but whit clone insted of write the html again as i allredy have it in the table
[10:25:26] <PurePandemonium> Whiskey: As I understand it, you're trying to copy some of the table rows, right?
[10:25:58] <lalalaaa> thats the problem with complex fiddles, people freak out due to the information overload and you end up not getting any help
[10:28:20] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: exactly
[10:28:45] <Whiskey> lalalaaa: i have try to make it a bit smaller but then i don´t understand what happen myself whit it
[10:29:28] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: i try to add one more row to 3 first but not last that not have any row
[10:29:35] <PurePandemonium> Whiskey: The big append block adds a table cell and calls it SubDir. Are you trying to copy rows, or add a new column?
[10:31:02] <PurePandemonium> Whiskey: OK. You want to add "SubDir:" to each row but NOT the Total Filesize row ?
[10:32:42] <PurePandemonium> I feel like you might get some good use out of variables to store the info you want to copy around, but I'm not completely sure what you're trying to accomplish
[10:37:48] <lalalaaa> anyway take care guys
[10:37:54] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel, PurePandemonium
[10:38:37] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: yeh
[10:38:59] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: it dosen´t matter whats in the column
[10:39:43] <PurePandemonium> Try this on for size http://jsfiddle.net/ahrznurq/
[10:40:34] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: yeh, i know but as i allredy have to columns, it most be away to just duplicate any of them?
[10:41:09] <Whiskey> whit cloe
[10:41:13] <Whiskey> wtf, clonne
[10:43:33] <Whiskey> PurePandemonium: i don´t see any reason to write the code again as i allredy have the structur on it, its just the values that need to be changed for them whit i can do whit html()
[10:44:06] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey you're trying to build a weird ad hoc templating system.
[10:44:10] <duch_kazatel> that's your problem.
[10:44:14] <PurePandemonium> then find the cell you're interested in and assign it to a variable
[10:45:27] <Whiskey> i don´t see why it can be cloned
[10:45:36] <PurePandemonium> var SomeCell = $("td:first").html()
[10:45:54] <duch_kazatel> it can be, but this is all really inefficient.
[10:46:13] <Whiskey> well more smarted then write the coder over agani
[10:46:29] <duch_kazatel> you're abstracting at the wrong level is my point.
[10:46:34] <PurePandemonium> Right but there are better ways to code a table and put some data into it
[10:46:39] <duch_kazatel> ^
[10:47:33] <Whiskey> :P
[10:48:25] <Whiskey> use this then: http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/aeyh1395/22/
[10:49:43] <PurePandemonium> And do what with it?
[10:49:47] <duch_kazatel> ol
[10:49:56] <duch_kazatel> *lol Whiskey you need a templating system.
[10:49:56] <Whiskey> Well it does what i was try to do whit the clone, so its a working code
[10:50:09] <loc22> Hi guys! Anyone know a plugin for showing a dropdown with elements under an input field?
[10:50:11] <duch_kazatel> you're cloning and editing - a templating engine would make much more sense here.
[10:50:43] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: like what?
[10:51:31] <Whiskey> this is done after x min thats why i edit the values in the tables duch_kazatel
[10:51:33] <duch_kazatel> whichever one you'd like.  even underscore has a templating system that's not too bad.
[10:53:06] <PurePandemonium> @loc22 like a select tag? Or different?
[10:53:56] <loc22> PurePandemonium: Different. Like an input where you can search and show suggestion list under it.
[10:54:04] <duch_kazatel> loc22 like an autocomplete/suggestions
[10:54:35] <loc22> duch_kazatel: Like that. I have been searching but I could not find a good one.
[10:55:04] <duch_kazatel> "good one"?
[10:55:10] <duch_kazatel> uh... define a "good one"?
[10:58:03] <Whiskey> :P
[10:58:10] <loc22> duch_kazatel: Someone just recommend me Typeahead.js, it looks great. I think I will use that
[10:58:47] <duch_kazatel> weko
[10:58:49] <duch_kazatel> *welp
[10:59:50] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:00:05] <PurePandemonium> Hello
[11:03:00] <rindolf> PurePandemonium: sup?
[11:11:20] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[11:11:23] <JosefDe> I need your exertise
[11:11:37] <JosefDe> Can anyone help me please?
[11:11:46] <duch_kazatel> just ask your question.
[11:11:51] <JosefDe> ok. Thanks
[11:11:51] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will.
[11:11:57] <duch_kazatel> asking to ask is redundant ;)
[11:12:04] <JosefDe> I'm struggling for days to find an efficient way of doing this:
[11:12:42] <Cyclohexane> Is anyone familiar with jquery sortable? If so, do you know if it's possible to basically start dragging an item, and then if a constraint is true add some more items to those that are currently being dragged?
[11:12:50] <JosefDe> I have a form, which contains multiple <input>-elements. In this form I have a submit-button. All the <input>-fields have some validation. Now I want to hide() the submit-button, if any of the <input> has validation error.
[11:13:10] <duch_kazatel> why?
[11:13:35] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Because that's the requirement
[11:13:52] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Because all of the <input>-elements are mandatory fields
[11:14:44] <duch_kazatel> i can hit "enter" to submit the form instead then ;)
[11:14:47] <JosefDe> My current solution is very bad: I'm iterating over each <input>-field every time any of the <input>-fields is changed with keyup-event
[11:14:56] <duch_kazatel> that's not really all that bad.,
[11:15:38] <JosefDe> But I don't know how I could solve this more elegantly
[11:16:29] <duch_kazatel> are you showing error messaging on any of the fields?
[11:17:16] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise you could do some weird object somewhere that holds validity state and update things on the fly there, then check the object, but that's kind of awkward, too.
[11:19:38] <JosefDe> The question is how to solve it the easiest and most efficient way
[11:19:52] <JosefDe> Our way of doing it looks a little bit hacky
[11:20:17] <lalalaaa> Hi! In Chrome dev tools I have `element.style { display: none; }` in my Styles tab. Is there a way to find out which part of my jQuery code is setting this?
[11:20:19] <duch_kazatel> that .each() call is basically your only real choice.
[11:20:39] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa find the string .hide() or 'display', 'none' in your code?
[11:21:54] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: Sorry -- is there a way to find out from within dev tools? My code has grown a lot lately and is now spanning a dozen different files so manually tracking it down would be quite difficult.
[11:22:32] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa i read your question :) there's no real way to know since CSS and DOM are kind of disconnected from one another in that way.
[11:22:41] <lalalaaa> Was hoping there'd be some sorta trace option
[11:22:44] <duch_kazatel> so your only real option is to grep your codebase for things that would set display none;
[11:22:57] <lalalaaa> Ah, ok coolio I will do that then
[11:22:59] <JosefDe> How about this?: http://www.plus2net.com/javascript_tutorial/form-submit.php
[11:23:28] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe are you asking for form validation?  or for a specific answer to your question
[11:23:28] <duch_kazatel> ?
[11:23:45] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: My question is about form validation
[11:23:54] <duch_kazatel> jquery validate then.
[11:23:59] <duch_kazatel> that's what i usually suggest.
[11:24:30] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: But I don't need that. I already have my simple validations. I only have to check if value is valid string or date..
[11:25:13] <zeroquake> are css : left - smvalue and animate scrollLeft 0 the same value
[11:25:52] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe errr, then there is no solution for you. the most efficient way to handle validation would be to use an out of the box solution like jquery validate
[11:26:07] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you're building everything yourself - including handling some enumeration work.
[11:26:11] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: And how would I disable my submit button with it?
[11:26:27] <duch_kazatel> jquery validate hooks to the form and prevents submission for you.
[11:26:36] <duch_kazatel> the docs are a little weird but you'll get the idea pretty quick.
[11:27:07] <JosefDe> And is it possible to hide the submit-button with it?
[11:27:33] <duch_kazatel> you should be able to hook all of that it, but that's really wonky UX.
[11:27:36] <duch_kazatel> *all of that in
[11:27:41] <duch_kazatel> it's relatively flexibile.
[11:29:59] <JosefDe> Ok. Hopefully that will also work with different <input>-elements which are hidden or shown depending on the currently chosen context
[11:31:12] <duch_kazatel> you can wire all of that if you want.
[11:31:29] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you have to build everything yourself from the ground up - that includes using .each() over inputs.
[11:33:08] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Not exactly if I'm doing it this way: http://www.plus2net.com/javascript_tutorial/form-submit.php
[11:33:45] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Meaning I bind event-listeners to each input-element for "keyup" or "clicked" and then call the validation function, which iterates over each element and checks validation
[11:34:07] <arup_r> how can I add a set of ids to a hidden field? hidden field looks like :
[11:34:09] <arup_r> <input multiple="multiple" type="hidden" value="" name="distribution_list[user_ids][]" id="distribution_list_user_ids">
[11:36:10] <JosefDe> Ok. Another question:
[11:36:52] <JosefDe> if I'm binding the "keyup" event on an element twice: Once to the element itself and once in general to all input-elements in the form, which binding is called on "keyup"-event?
[11:40:08] <duch_kazatel> the one on the element JosefDe
[11:40:46] <JosefDe> Ok. It works
[11:40:59] <duch_kazatel> but you should default to just having one on the form.
[11:41:12] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Actually both are called
[11:41:16] <duch_kazatel> right./
[11:41:26] <duch_kazatel> oh, you weren't talking abnout order.
[11:42:55] <JosefDe> A last question: I have an input hidden field. I want to bind a keyup event on it and want it to fire, when I write a value into this input with ".val()".
[11:43:25] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:44:12] <JosefDe> ok forget it :)
[11:49:25] <duch_kazatel> i feel like you're making things overcomplicated, but oK.
[12:01:37] <soee_> hi, how can i find all elements of type UL that aren't parents of clicked item ?
[12:03:12] <gnarf> b-ot is back, but now running cloudbot --- factoids are on ? now
[12:06:23] <PurePandemonium> soee_ something like $("ul").not(clickedItem.parents()) ?
[12:06:52] <soee_> PurePandemonium: yes  just used it and works fine
[12:08:59] <arup_r> any help to me ?
[12:11:26] <PurePandemonium> arup_r: what's your question?
[12:12:17] <arup_r> how can I add a set of ids to a hidden field? hidden field looks like :
[12:12:18] <arup_r> <arup_r> <input multiple="multiple" type="hidden" value="" name="distribution_list[user_ids][]" id="distribution_list_user_ids">
[12:14:34] <PurePandemonium> Something like this ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3073001/passing-multiple-values-with-hidden-input-fields

[12:29:03] <arup_r> let me see

[12:36:58] <StephenS> is there a json parser for a response from server?
[12:37:11] <duch_kazatel> StephenS is the format a big json string?
[12:37:20] <StephenS> e.g. I send data via post method, and I want to parse response in JSON
[12:37:28] <StephenS> duch_kazatel, big json string?
[12:37:41] <StephenS> Its just simple {"success":true/false} format
[12:37:47] <duch_kazatel> then no need to parse.
[12:37:49] <StephenS> nothing nested and sich
[12:37:51] <duch_kazatel> data.success;
[12:37:59] <StephenS> ic thanks
[12:38:41] <StephenS> will data.success automatically be casted to boolean?
[12:38:55] <duch_kazatel> depends on what the data actually looks like.
[12:39:25] <duch_kazatel> if there are no quotes around the true/false, then it's already a boolean.
[12:41:01] <StephenS> there are not quotes, but it seems jquery is not recognizing this as boolean
[12:41:08] <duch_kazatel> *javascript.
[12:41:13] <duch_kazatel> console.log() the data.
[12:41:23] <duch_kazatel> and share that.
[12:41:25] <StephenS> I just did a test with if(!data.success) { console.log("ya"); }
[12:41:28] <StephenS> and data.success is true
[12:41:30] <StephenS> weird
[12:41:39] <duch_kazatel> console.log(typeof data);
[12:41:44] <duch_kazatel> what're you getting there?
[12:42:55] <StephenS> data is string
[12:43:00] <StephenS> data.success is undefined
[12:43:05] <duch_kazatel> right, because data is a string.
[12:43:17] <duch_kazatel> so you need to do JSON.stringify(data).success
[12:43:35] <duch_kazatel> because the data you're getting back is a string of json.
[12:43:40] <StephenS> well thats what I was asking the whole time
[12:43:50] <StephenS> approach on "how to cast or whatever" in jQuery :)
[12:43:56] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn't case.
[12:43:59] <duch_kazatel> and that's why i asked "StephenS is the format a big json string?"
[12:44:13] <duch_kazatel> *jquery doesn't cast.
[12:47:34] <StephenS> hmm duch_kazatel JSON.stringify(msg).success; returns undefined for a type
[12:47:43] <duch_kazatel> share the data then.
[12:47:47] <duch_kazatel> console.log(data);
[12:47:51] <StephenS> undefined?
[12:47:53] <duch_kazatel> paste that into bpaste or something.
[12:47:58] <duch_kazatel> then share your ajax code.
[12:48:02] <StephenS> its msg for me :)
[12:48:04] <duch_kazatel> becuase something isn't adding up here
[12:48:47] <StephenS> console.log(typeof msg); == string ; var test = JSON.stringify(msg).success; console.log(typeof test) == undefined..
[12:48:52] <duch_kazatel> the ajax code.
[12:48:53] <Sourcey> Hello, I got a mouseenter function and within this i want to grab hold of a div class and set .show
[12:49:09] <duch_kazatel> and share a copy of the return.
[12:49:15] <Sourcey> Tried many things like this : $(this).children('.drop_down').show()
[12:49:20] <duch_kazatel> Sourcey of the "div class"?
[12:49:52] <duch_kazatel> Sourcey you mean all .drop_down children of the thing you hovered?  try .find() instead of .chidren() then.
[12:49:55] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/tMgCbEb0
[12:50:26] <duch_kazatel> StephenS weird - copy of the data pls.
[12:50:29] <StephenS> I mean I could easily solve this with checking against string, but generally I hate doing if(blah == "true"), it just looks retarded
[12:50:47] <duch_kazatel> hey so that word isn't ok - please don't use it!
[12:51:06] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, share a copy of the data then, because i'm guessing there's a mismatch here.
[12:52:09] <StephenS> response?
[12:52:11] <StephenS> response is success: true
[12:52:17] <duch_kazatel> i don't believe you.
[12:52:24] <duch_kazatel> console.log it and share a copy with me.
[12:52:27] <StephenS> in php is this: echo '{"success":true}';
[12:52:38] <duch_kazatel> the actual response the javascript is recieving.
[12:52:47] <duch_kazatel> on the other end.  i need to see that pls.
[12:53:01] <StephenS> here: {"success":true}
[12:53:09] <duch_kazatel> then msg.success should work.
[12:53:17] <duch_kazatel> unless msg is a string, then you need to json.parse it.
[12:54:22] <StephenS> lmao
[12:54:24] <StephenS> I solved it
[12:54:56] <StephenS> not sure if thats what you pointed out, but I simple 1st stringified whole string into an object, and then just did obj.success
[12:55:04] <StephenS> simply* anyway all good now
[12:55:57] <Sourcey> duch_kazatel: Sorry, late respons. I have an li that Im doing the mouseenter on. Within this li I have a <div class="blabla">
[12:56:04] <Sourcey> I want to set that div to visible
[12:56:16] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: You were right. Now if I hit enter, the form is submitted, even if the submit-button is hidden
[13:02:17] <duch_kazatel> StephenS thats... exactly what i pointed out...
[13:02:34] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe yep.
[13:02:39] <duch_kazatel> that's how forms work ;)
[13:03:14] <StephenS> duch_kazatel, but there are some mismatches though
[13:03:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:04:25] <StephenS> var obj = JSON.stringify(msg);
[13:04:25] <StephenS> 			console.log(typeof obj);
[13:04:31] <StephenS> that returns type of string
[13:04:35] <duch_kazatel> JSON.parse()
[13:04:46] <duch_kazatel> that's what i meant.  sorry.
[13:04:48] <duch_kazatel> long day
[13:05:27] <StephenS> .... yah that works
[13:05:31] <duch_kazatel> my bad.
[13:07:44] <JosefDe> strange..
[13:10:59] <JosefDe> I don't understand this..
[13:11:11] <duch_kazatel> have a question?
[13:11:14] <JosefDe> yes
[13:11:17] <duch_kazatel> then ask :)
[13:11:42] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, supposing that i have a var that holds some <tr>s resulting out of the expression $("#table_id).find("tr"), is there a more direct way to append those <tr>s in another html table other than using a for loop to append each <tr> separately?
[13:11:57] <duch_kazatel> naftilos76 just append the var.
[13:12:14] <naftilos76> duch_kazatel, thanks
[13:12:21] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: I'm doing $('body').on('submit', '.myForm', function(submitEvent) { submitEvent.preventDefault(); }); This works, if I newly open the form. But if the hidden submit button is shown once and then hidden --> If I hit enter, form is sent
[13:13:21] <duch_kazatel> i need to ditch out and get some other stuff done - sorry folks.
[13:13:23] <duch_kazatel> JosefDe good luck.
[13:13:32] <naftilos76> duch_kazatel, what if i want to append a certain range of the <tr>s in my var? Is there anything to help me with that as well so that i can skip looping  through <tr>s ?
[13:13:38] <PurePandemonium> later duch
[13:13:43] <duch_busy> naftilos76 you can use .slice()
[13:13:58] <duch_busy> or .filter()
[13:14:03] <duch_busy> all kinds of options.
[13:14:04] <duch_busy> enjoy folks.
[13:14:05] <naftilos76> duch_busy, simple array stuff!
[13:14:09] <naftilos76> ok thanks
[13:14:13] <duch_busy> naftilos76 you want the jquery versions fwiw.
[13:14:35] <naftilos76> yep i will look now thanks
[13:14:48] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[13:19:13] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: whats the issue/
[13:20:03] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: I have a hidden submit button in my form. I'm trying to prevent the form to be sent as long as this submit button is not shown
[13:20:16] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: I'm doing $('body').on('submit', '.myForm', function(submitEvent) { submitEvent.preventDefault(); });
[13:20:42] <JosefDe> This works the first time, when the submit-button is hidden. But as soon as it is shown at least once and then hidden again, the submit-event is not prevented
[13:21:05] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: pastebin / fiddle?
[13:38:16] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: Are you online?
[13:38:26] <NoiseEee> uh yeah
[13:38:32] <duch_busy> lol this guy
[13:39:03] <JosefDe> The problem is, that after showing the submit-button it gets the focus, which isn't removed from the submit-button, even if it his hidden again
[13:39:22] <JosefDe> To remove the focus from submit-button I probably have to do it manually with jQuery
[13:39:25] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: show code or i can't really help you
[13:39:32] <NoiseEee> focus has nothing to do with submitting
[13:39:44] <NoiseEee> i have no idea what your code is so i can't possibly hazard a guess as to the solution
[13:39:59] <NoiseEee> also if duch_busy couldn't help you, its unlikely i will be able to offer more
[13:40:13] <duch_busy> d'awww thanks buddy
[13:40:20] <duch_busy> (nah but really, make a fiddle)
[13:40:37] <duch_busy> like... there's a really good reason people ask for them.
[13:41:32] <JosefDe> Yeah. It fixes my problem if I do .blur() besides .hide()
[13:42:32] <JosefDe> no!!!
[13:42:38] <JosefDe> I get crazy
[13:43:29] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: try pointing at it with your mouse for a few moments, then stop
[13:43:41] <JosefDe> ?
[13:43:43] <NoiseEee> or try saying "YES!" three times loud, then "NO!" two times quietly
[13:43:52] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: just trying to help you debug
[13:43:59] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: i can only help so much if you DO NOT SHOW CODE
[13:44:25] <NoiseEee> or, just keep throwing shit against the wall and see what sticks
[13:44:26] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[13:44:53] <zzaichik> Let's say I have an element with multiple classnames and I want to use replace to remove all of them except for part of one. Is there an easier way to do that without having to use .replace() back to back to back?
[13:45:32] <JosefDe> lol I get crazy
[13:45:32] <NoiseEee> zzaichik: wait why are you using replace at all?
[13:45:45] <NoiseEee> zzaichik: https://api.jquery.com/removeclass/
[13:45:48] <JosefDe> If I do .blur() in browser console, the problem is solved. But if I do it in my javascript-code, still same problem
[13:46:49] <zzaichik> Well, I don't need to actually remove the classes from the DOM, I'm creating a variable that is associated with another element on the page.
[13:47:12] <NoiseEee> you'd think it was a friday in here
[13:47:14] <JosefDe> I don't understand this
[13:47:43] <JosefDe> ok let me create jsfiddle
[13:48:11] <zzaichik> So I have an element with the classname 'nav-slide-1' and another element with content associated to that nav link with the classname 'slide-1.' But the nav also has some other classnames added to it (skrollable, skrollable-begin)
[13:52:46] <zzaichik> This is what I mean. http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/2fj7p6k9/
[13:53:01] <zzaichik> Having 50 .replace()'s is gross
[13:53:22] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: Are you there my friend?
[13:53:58] <duch_busy> zzaichik just store the slide thin in a data attribute.
[13:55:15] <JosefDe> Can anyone help me with this please?: https://jsfiddle.net/ya2tLm72/9/
[13:55:37] <JosefDe> The problem is: I want to prevent submission of form, when the submit-button is hidden and I press ENTER
[13:55:50] <zzaichik> duch_busy: that's probably going to be the best approach huh
[13:56:03] <JosefDe> This works if the submit-button was never shown. But as soon as it is shown at least once and then hidden again, submission when hitting ENTER is not prevented
[13:56:23] <zzaichik> Okay, thanks man!
[13:56:51] <duch_busy> JosefDe $('#submitbutton:visible') is always going to be "true"
[13:57:00] <duch_busy> in javascript, objects are always truthy.
[13:57:13] <duch_busy> jquery objects are the same way - you need to check the .length
[13:57:56] <JosefDe> duch_busy: why always true?
[13:57:59] <JosefDe> oh :)
[13:58:03] <NoiseEee> if($('#submitbutton').is(':visible')) { //do stuff }
[13:58:10] <duch_busy> ^ this would be the better way.
[13:58:12] <JosefDe> I'm emberassed
[13:58:36] <JosefDe> Did you guys see the movie "Interstellar"?
[13:58:52] <duch_busy> JosefDe in javascript, you have false, 0, '' (empty string), NaN, undefined, and null - every other object is truthy.
[14:03:10] <JosefDe> Ok. So checking it with .length is the way to do it?
[14:03:22] <duch_busy> use what NoiseEee sent
[14:03:33] <duch_busy> see how quickly you got help when you just gave us the fiddle?
[14:03:48] <JosefDe> ah wait..
[14:03:49] <JosefDe> wait!
[14:04:08] <JosefDe> I'm already doing that as you can see in my jsfiddle
[14:04:12] <JosefDe> https://jsfiddle.net/ya2tLm72/9/
[14:04:23] <duch_busy> no you're not.
[14:04:27] <duch_busy> if(!$('#submitbutton:visible')) { is not the same thing.
[14:04:50] <duch_busy> http://api.jquery.com/is/ what does this return? :)
[14:05:26] <JosefDe> boolean
[14:05:31] <JosefDe> and mine returns an object
[14:05:34] <duch_busy> exactly.
[14:05:35] <JosefDe> ok. I get the point :)
[14:05:50] <duch_busy> console.log() is your friend.  you should check out fixingthesejquery.com
[14:05:58] <JosefDe> These times I only sleep 4-5 hours a day. I should get more sleep
[14:17:37] <JosefDe> No. It doesn't fix it
[14:19:36] <duch_busy> proof ;)
[14:20:02] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: another thing to consider is changing the <input type='submit'> to a <button type='button'>
[14:20:25] <NoiseEee> putting  a handler on the <button> to submit the form
[14:20:32] <NoiseEee> that will stop <enter> from submitting the form
[14:20:42] <NoiseEee> but, otherwise, update your fiddle
[14:21:42] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: Locally this strange thing happens: If I hit enter $('body').on('submit', '#form1',function(){..}); is not called, when the submit-button was shown and hidden again
[14:22:02] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: you're telling me https://jsfiddle.net/ya2tLm72/11/ doesn't do what you want?
[14:23:07] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: the strange thing is that console.log() is not outputted..
[14:23:16] <NoiseEee> what console.log
[14:23:18] <NoiseEee> what what what what
[14:23:20] <JosefDe> So it doesn't seem to get into the eventhandler
[14:23:32] <NoiseEee> you make it hard to help you, man
[14:23:33] <JosefDe> I'm doing console.log() inside the event-handler for submit
[14:23:36] <duch_busy> JosefDe we cannot see code if you don't put it indo the fiddle.
[14:23:41] <duch_busy> update the fiddle to match your environment.
[14:23:48] <duch_busy> *into
[14:24:00] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: changing to .is(':visible') seemed to solve all of your 'original' issues
[14:24:13] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: https://jsfiddle.net/ya2tLm72/11/
[14:24:28] <NoiseEee> yeah thats the link i pasted
[14:24:30] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: I don't see any console.log()-output. This means, we're not getting into the submit-eventhandler
[14:24:33] <NoiseEee> where's anything about any console.log?
[14:25:14] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/ya2tLm72/14/
[14:25:25] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: https://jsfiddle.net/ya2tLm72/13/
[14:25:38] <JosefDe> NoiseEee: It's in the submit-eventhandler
[14:28:10] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: i don't know what to say
[14:28:14] <NoiseEee> everythign works as specified
[14:28:19] <NoiseEee> in yours and in my most recent one
[14:28:21] <JosefDe> Locally I don't get into the submit-eventhandler..
[14:28:40] <JosefDe> Locally I'm using a classname instead of the id, but that shouldn't be the problem
[14:28:41] <NoiseEee> reload or something
[14:28:57] <NoiseEee> also, always a great idea to paste something into a fiddle that's different than what you're actually working with
[14:29:15] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: no offense, but its cases like these that make good hearted people not want to help anyone
[14:29:23] <NoiseEee> JosefDe: you make it SO DIFFICULT TO HELP
[14:29:25] <NoiseEee> so i am done
[14:29:26] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[14:29:29] <JosefDe> ok
[14:31:08] <NoiseEee> sheesh (tm)
[14:37:45] <duch_busy> yeah....
[14:38:58] <hassoon> nah....
[14:41:17] <spriz> Hi! Anyone have a moment regarding autocomplete widget? :)
[14:43:44] <spriz> I have this in my select function in the autocomplete widget, and as you can see in the comments on line 8 - something is really not behaving well.... https://gist.github.com/Spriz/15defe8000ea113c96e7
[14:57:58] <plamb> how would i bind the enter keypress to this
[14:57:59] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/4HjRLMsQ
[14:58:04] <plamb> as well as the on click
[14:59:19] <plamb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9146651/trigger-an-event-on-click-and-enter
[14:59:21] <plamb> O I C
[15:01:46] <plamb> hmm
[15:02:00] <plamb> how could i bind it so it runs any time enter is pressed on the page
[15:05:03] <plamb> bind it to "html" ?
[15:08:06] <plamb> its weird, it runs the ajax then immediately runs the default behavior again after it
[15:10:31] <plamb> i see the results for a split second
[15:10:43] <duch_busy> hey so we can't see your current code :)
[15:10:54] <duch_busy> might be helpful if you tossed out an updated paste.
[15:11:06] <plamb> current code
[15:11:06] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/f1dKkfTd
[15:12:28] <plamb> oddly enough when i click to do the search, no new URL appears, just the results below id=#ajax
[15:12:39] <plamb> but when i press enter a new URL appears
[15:25:58] <plamb> its weird
[15:26:08] <plamb> it runs the search and reloads the page
[15:35:42] <shoky> plamb: sounds like the form is being submitted. instead of the button's click event,  you should handle the form's submit event,  and inside call event.preventDefault() on the event argument
[15:44:27] <acidjazz> HANDLE THE CLICK EVENT
[15:44:28] <acidjazz> HANDLE IT
[15:44:30] <acidjazz> IWTH THE HANDLER
[15:44:46] <acidjazz> ITS EVENTFUL SO HANDLE IT LETS GO PEOPLE JQUERY FUCK YEA #CHECKYOURPRIVILEDGE
[16:02:44] <pragma-> acidjazz: you're kind of retarded, huh?
[16:05:58] <Phoenixz> Don
[16:06:04] <Phoenixz> 'Don't feed trolls
[16:08:29] <acidjazz> aw he left right after
[18:33:11] <Guddu> Hi All...If i add input elements using jquery then when I do a form submit i am not getting those dynamically added elements in the POST data. Please help with pointers as to how I can get them posted.
[19:10:34] <Utils> Oddly, $el.data('tab-type', 'roomlist') doesn't work but $el.attr('data-tab-type', 'roomlist') does. anyone have any ideas why that might be?
[19:12:49] <Utils> also tried it with tabtype instead of tab-type to confirm its not the hyphen.
[19:15:06] <shoky> Utils: what doesn't work about it?  it's not supposed to be setting the data-tab-type attribute, if that's what you're expecting
[19:19:32] <Utils> yes that is what i was expecting... what does it do instead then?
[19:28:39] <shoky> Utils: it puts the data in jquery's internal data cache, and makes sure that when you call .data() again to read something you've previously written on an element, it will still be there
[19:29:01] <shoky> it's more efficient than storing data on a DOM element attribute
[19:30:01] <shoky> so you can see that it works by calling  $el.data('tab-type')  and it should give you 'roomlist'
[19:30:37] <shoky> also it lets you store any js data, not just strings
[21:26:38] <arup_r> How can I put an array inside the hidden field ?
[22:08:30] <dumptruckman> hello
[22:08:49] <dumptruckman> i'm having this strange problem with this jquery mobile app
[22:08:56] <dumptruckman> http://i.imgur.com/sUN2hhZ.png
[22:09:09] <dumptruckman> The 3 boxes on the left are all buttons
[22:09:17] <dumptruckman> the one that says Initiative is a selectmenu
[22:09:34] <dumptruckman> they all share the same css classes
[22:09:52] <dumptruckman> in my preview it shows up fine (level with the top)... when i actually run it it comes up out of place
[22:10:04] <dumptruckman> i've tried absolute position with top:0
[22:10:16] <dumptruckman> but it's still in the same place
[23:05:32] <Kartagis> hi
[23:22:47] <Uhkis> hello!
[23:33:01] <arup_r> What should be the format string using moment.js for this "October 2 2015 - 11:24 AM IST"
[23:36:00] <arc_> http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/
[23:37:46] <arup_r> arc_: I know. but my format string not working
[23:39:03] <arup_r> I came up with MMMM D YYYY - h:m A z
[23:39:13] <arup_r> but it seems wrong.. but not able to figure out
[23:39:47] <arc_> if you look at that, it says that z/zz are deprecated
[23:39:53] <arc_> and there is a link to a thread
[23:40:56] <Uhkis>         
[23:41:03] <Uhkis> vim .bash_h
[23:41:16] <Uhkis> Gdddddddddddddddddddddddddddd:x
[23:41:19] <Uhkis> source .bashrc
[23:41:25] <Uhkis> vim .bas_h
[23:41:28] <Uhkis> G:q
[23:41:34] <Cork> O_o
[23:41:36] <Uhkis> ssh acidjazz
[23:41:37] <arc_> r u ok

[23:41:41] <arup_r> arc_: whar should I use ?
[23:41:44] <Uhkis> G:q
[23:41:57] <Cork> Uhkis: please stop that...
[23:42:07] <Uhkis> w-t-f :D
[23:42:10] <arc_> looks like he probably had a list of something in his clipboard
[23:42:19] <arc_> arup_r the answer is there if you look
[23:42:21] <Uhkis> terminator going haywire
[23:43:18] <Uhkis> typed those on the other tab and it came here too, wtf :D
[23:43:44] <arc_> good thing you weren't logging in
[23:44:14] <Uhkis> but how on earth did that happen, that's a huge security concern
[23:46:06] <arc_> i agree
[23:53:26] <Uhkis> lol someone got a hilight from that :D
