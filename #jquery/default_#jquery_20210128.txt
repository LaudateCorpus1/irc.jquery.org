[02:21:48] <dimi1947> what exactly the term querySelector means? Jquery search functionality does not work so I can find info....I have found this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector but I do not think is related to jquery
[02:53:12] <pavonia> dimi1947: It's the basic function the browser provides to select elements from the DOM by a CSS selector
[02:53:42] <pavonia> When you do $("..."), jQuery uses this function to perform the query
[02:54:25] <pavonia> Or well, actually querySelectorAll, but they are related
[02:57:15] <robertmaxrees> ^ in fact, queryselector/queryselectorall were inspired by jquery :)
[03:01:34] <pavonia> How was it done before jQuery?
[03:02:06] <robertmaxrees> getElementById, getElementsByTagName, etc.
[03:05:04] <pavonia> And the combinators by traversing from the results?
[03:05:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.  enumerating/iterating those collections of DOM nodes and checking each one for whatever you needed.
[03:06:29] <robertmaxrees> there was a time where you had to treat the class attribute as a space-delimited string and parse it yourself.
[03:09:41] <dimi1947> so when  $("...") querySelector works UNDER THE HOOD
[03:09:44] <dimi1947> ??
[03:10:11] <robertmaxrees> depending on the selector you pass and the browser, it uses querySelectorAll
[03:10:24] <robertmaxrees> querySelector just returns the first element.  querySelectorAll returms all of them.
[03:10:50] <dimi1947> anyway...either the one or the other
[03:11:10] <robertmaxrees> not "anyway" lol - it's only QSA :)
[03:11:20] <dimi1947> QSA?
[03:11:25] <robertmaxrees> querySelectorAll
[03:11:54] <dimi1947> but of course this not see in jqyery code
[03:11:59] <dimi1947> seen
[03:12:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[03:13:41] <robertmaxrees> you mean you don't see people using it when they're also using jquery?
[03:14:25] <dimi1947> I mean that IF i write jquery code..this function is not used anywhere...cause it works under the hood
[03:14:42] <dimi1947> do you get it?
[03:14:49] <robertmaxrees> sure, though it's worth pointing out you're not writing "jquery code" - you're still writing javascript.  you're just using jquery.
[03:15:07] <dimi1947> yes...agree
[03:15:09] <robertmaxrees> but otherwise, correct - it would be strange to use QSA while also using jquery.
[07:18:51] <onizu> hello
[07:19:31] <onizu> I want to restore an element detached from the DOM using detach(), in the exact same location as it was before.. how do I store its original location for appending later?
[09:02:05] <Cork> onizu: you can't really do that
[09:02:17] <Cork> you can stor what element it was after maybe?
[09:02:32] <Cork> might be better to just hide the element instead
[09:12:50] <onizu> hmm
[09:13:35] <onizu> hide , display:none, are not helping as I'm using the first-child css property and display:none doesn't remove it from the DOM
[09:14:01] <onizu> anyway, I added conditional css using php

[17:17:29] <sine0> hi. im thinking of using a css toggle switch for a yes/no on my form, but selecting it does not seem to effect its state and im not sure how to pick it up on submission: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp
[17:18:30] <robertmaxrees> sine0 how does this involve jquery?
[17:22:28] <sine0> well, im using jquery for my ajax form, im wondering if there was a $("#some_id").attr("checked") ? 1 : 0; type solution
[17:23:58] <sine0> I think i will have to make my own boolean check code for it, and update the element like <custom class="" checked> <custom class=""> type of thing
[17:25:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:25:07] <robertmaxrees> give the input a name.
[17:25:18] <robertmaxrees> and the state will update correctly.
[17:26:28] <robertmaxrees> (without having any other context around what your "ajax form" is like, there's nothing i can really suggest other than to just use a normal input)
[17:28:46] <sine0> it does respond to checked> being in the end on page refresh as it defaults to "on", i think my mistake is thinking it would update the element live in devtools chrome
[17:29:01] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, no.
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> the checked attribute doesn't update.
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> the property does.
[17:33:57] <sine0> robertmaxrees: how do i grab the propoerty value
[17:34:05] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked')
[17:34:37] <sine0> wow
[17:34:40] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:34:41] <sine0> I never new that
[17:34:54] <sine0> i mean i been scrapping with jquery for a bit in basic ways
[17:35:10] <robertmaxrees> when working with form controls you want to check properties, not attributes.
[17:42:20] <sine0> thanks for the info
[17:44:27] <robertmaxrees> sure
