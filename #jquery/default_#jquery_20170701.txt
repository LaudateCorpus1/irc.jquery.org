[12:10:37] <kre10s> hi. Using .slider(); the objects created for the hanle are empty spans. on firefox, this has the nasty effect of showing a dotted border around the span when it is clicked. It is not possible to remove the border with css. I can remove the border by placing a character or even &nbsp; in the span. How can I get slider to do this for me?
