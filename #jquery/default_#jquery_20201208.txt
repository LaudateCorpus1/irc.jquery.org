[15:03:39] <BridRM> Hi all, I'm filling out a form on a webpage that has a UL single select list, but thousands of entries. (https://i.imgur.com/xhdKLMl.png). Each time one is clicked on, a <li class gets added - "ms-selected". I read somewhere that from within the browsers developer console, you can run a jquery command to select or set all Li items to "ms-selected"
[15:03:40] <BridRM> which would then select all fields in the screenshot. Is this possible and any pointers to try? Don't want to be selecting that many fields manually.
[15:18:39] <shoky> BridRM you can do e.g. $('ul > li').addClass('ms-selected')   but that might not be enough to actually have those items considered to be "selected"
[15:19:10] <shoky> (even if they appear to be selected in the UI)
[15:19:55] <BridRM> shoky - thank you. I figured it was probably not that simple.
[15:22:04] <shoky> BridRM if it's a decent UI then you can click on first entry, then shift click the last entry.  (if not, it's not a decent UI :P)
[15:22:47] <BridRM> It's not :(  it selects as soon as you click, no chance to shift click anywhere else
[15:23:47] <shoky> you can also try to trigger a fake click..  $().trigger('click')
[15:29:27] <BridRM> looks like that might crash my tab :D
[15:47:07] <shoky> heh
[15:48:00] <robertmaxrees> welp
