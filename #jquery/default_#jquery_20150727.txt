[00:01:33] <Kartagis> just ask your question
[00:41:42] <JSPractice> hi. is there a function like .one() but something that is clickable twice or three times?
[00:42:13] <JSPractice> like in case i want to make a "hint" button, but i want this hint to be clickable only 3 times
[00:45:14] <Kartagis> JSPractice: count how many times it was clicked, and remove its clickable property if it's 3
[00:47:54] <JSPractice> Kartagis: okay thanks. i was going to do that but i figured maybe there's some inbuilt function
[01:22:10] <Xatenev> Heya
[01:22:23] <Xatenev> Im having a weird problem i cannot really reproduce
[01:22:29] <Xatenev> just maybe anybody has an idea
[01:22:32] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/bmupn0tp/1/ my code
[01:22:44] <Xatenev> I have a variable oldContactHtml and a variable oldDownloadHtml there
[01:22:56] <Xatenev> on two ajax requests, HTML is saved into it
[01:23:13] <Xatenev> because we replace the old HTML with new one which comes from the ajax request
[01:23:29] <sanketdg> how would I echo jquery from php?
[01:23:40] <Xatenev> so sometimes now it happens, that the NEW Html is saved into the variable oldContactHtml or oldDownloadHtml
[01:23:44] <sanketdg> I used $ but from browser console it shows $ is not defined.
[01:23:48] <Xatenev> but it only happens sometimes :(
[01:24:02] <Xatenev> anybody has an idea how to solve this problem or has an idea on even how to debug this problem? :P
[01:26:22] <Xatenev> Cork: ? :P

[03:09:11] <RWOverdijk> I have an event listener on('submit', fn) which prevents the default. Further down in fn, I wish to (conditionally) submit the form to the server. How can I do this?
[03:09:28] <RWOverdijk> I tried .submit() and .trigger('submit') but it doesn't do the actual submit

[03:10:23] <RWOverdijk> One minor detail, at the top of my listener, before anything else, I'm currently doing a if (useLegacy) {return true;} because I thought that would still send the submit to the servr

[03:48:46] <Germanaz0> Hello, I've a problem with MouseWheel, the velocity of scroll somehow becomes veeeery fast on OSX but when I try to fix it with normalize delta, then the velocity on Windows, become veeery slow
[04:00:20] <tuskkk___> Why is the emailArray blank in that alert? http://jsfiddle.net/d4c4ujvd/
[04:10:57] <RWOverdijk> tuskkk___, Because you're defining the variable multiple times
[04:11:11] <RWOverdijk> Once in the global scope, and once in the body listener
[04:11:42] <walabe> omfg
[04:11:44] <RWOverdijk> Anyway, I'd refactor this code entirely if I were you
[04:11:48] <walabe> why won't my stupid ass slider work
[04:11:53] <RWOverdijk> haha, ass slider
[04:11:55] <RWOverdijk> whoosh
[04:12:17] <walabe> can someone help me
[04:12:44] <taplar> example of the issue would be nice
[04:12:54] <walabe> i've got to upload it
[04:13:04] <walabe> but it's in my site, among lots of code is that ok
[04:13:20] <taplar> small working example of the issue is preferred
[04:13:48] <walabe> well the issue is inside my site, i can't get it to work in my site and i'm going to pull my eyeballs out and throw them across thwa ll
[04:16:31] <walabe> http://chronox.netai.net/ why won't my "unslider" work?
[04:17:13] <taplar> i see three errors in my console
[04:17:28] <fitzilla> hey, any idea how to target a google map pin through jquery ?
[04:17:38] <fitzilla> for instance, if i targeted an input button...
[04:17:43] <walabe> yes and they are all unrelevent to the issue i've checked conosol
[04:17:55] <fitzilla> it would be something like. on('click','input[type=submit]'
[04:17:56] <taplar> TypeError: $(...).unslider is not a function
[04:18:02] <taplar> that does not seem unrelevent
[04:18:14] <taplar> your trying to use a function before it is defined
[04:18:29] <walabe> oh i don't see that one in mine
[04:18:46] <taplar> and TypeError: $(...).waypoint is not a function
[04:19:06] <walabe> yeah i see that one
[04:19:09] <walabe> hmmmm
[04:19:10] <taplar> make sure you have in your console js warnings and errors turned on
[04:21:40] <walabe> Ugh, i still don't see what i've done wrong
[04:21:42] <walabe> it should be working
[04:24:33] <RWOverdijk> walabe, If it doesn't, it shouldn't
[04:24:52] <walabe> i don't know why it isnt work
[04:24:54] <walabe> working
[04:24:56] <taplar> it looks like a couple of your waypoint usages are outside document readies
[04:25:23] <walabe> no the waypoints are a different issue, unless they are interfering??
[04:25:45] <taplar> dunno, general rule of thumb, fix errors before proceeding
[04:31:03] <walabe> why can't i get ONE slider to work
[04:32:35] <walabe> i remove waypoints and cleaned the code a bit http://chronox.netai.net/
[04:34:35] <walabe> can you put like html pages inside this http://unslider.com/ instead of pictures??
[04:36:01] <taplar> unfamiliar with this plugin
[04:36:32] <walabe> any suggestions for a responsive, ipad friendly, slider which i can put html elements inside?
[04:37:38] <taplar> from the site it looks like you can with unslider.  you can stick lots of stuff between lis
[04:37:49] <walabe> okay right
[04:38:00] <walabe> so yeah that's what I'm doing, but i'll go double check things agian
[04:40:54] <taplar> the console is also complaining about trying to load a mp4 as text/html?
[04:41:48] <walabe> oh yeah i haven't uploaded the mp4 onto the server
[04:41:54] <walabe> on purpose because it's big
[04:42:19] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/1u7nLu6h/14/ <--- what's wrong with lines 25-27?
[04:42:58] <walabe> where can i get this done for me? like pay someone to do it?
[04:44:06] <taplar> can't advise you there.  this is primarily a free help room.
[04:44:39] <taplar> Kartagis: that if would always be true.  what are you trying to do?
[04:45:27] <Kartagis> taplar: I'm trying to remove the container if it already exists
[04:45:37] <taplar> Kartagis: but your creating it
[04:45:52] <taplar> :)
[04:46:37] <taplar> what your probably wanting to do is $('.container').length
[04:46:40] <Kartagis> taplar: yeah, I know, but it needs to be removed in order not to append every time, thus the list getting huge
[04:47:06] <Kartagis> am I not already doing that?
[04:47:31] <taplar> nope, line 14 your creating a brand new one
[04:47:39] <taplar> your then checking that brand new one to see if it exits, yes
[04:47:42] <taplar> you remove it
[04:47:49] <taplar> then you try to add your nothing to your body
[04:48:16] <Germanaz0> someone knows why the mousewheel plugin on OSX works very fast ? instead windows very slow ?
[04:49:05] <walabe> SAIALVAKGJHF;
[04:49:45] <Kartagis> walabe: do you own a cat?
[04:50:09] <walabe> i need helppp
[04:50:19] <walabe> so badly
[04:50:20] <taplar> Kartagis: as another option, instead of creating a new one every time, you could only created it and append it if it does not exist.  if it does exist, clear out the inner html
[04:50:43] <Kartagis> uhm
[04:53:25] <taplar> Kartagis: and also that could probably be moved outside of the each
[04:54:36] <taplar> Kartagis: and instead of ' ad[0].innerHTML ' you can do ad.html()
[04:54:57] <Kartagis> ad.innerHTML doesn't work
[04:55:02] <Kartagis> I tried
[04:55:21] <taplar> ad[0].innerHTML === ad.html()
[04:56:14] <Kartagis> oh, I misread
[04:56:19] <Herehere> Guys, how to add row with values in it? I have something like this     $('.non_empty_tr').insertAfter('.thead tr')
[04:56:19] <Herehere>  but I got empty row :/
[04:57:17] <Kartagis> Herehere: did you also .append()?
[04:57:53] <Herehere> Kartagis: Nope, as you see I didnt
[04:58:32] <taplar> Herehere: insert after, as names, inserts after the element
[04:58:40] <taplar> Herehere: append inserts inside, at the end
[04:59:17] <taplar> mmm, but you are doing trs
[04:59:27] <taplar> so that should be fine
[04:59:43] <Herehere> taplar: So my code is good?
[04:59:45] <mdev> careful with append
[04:59:59] <mdev> I used it on a richtext and it really messed things up
[05:00:31] <mdev> had to do it another way
[05:00:44] <taplar> Herehere: can't tell just from that line.  $('.non_empty_tr') as your doing it would have to already exist on the page.  that line would find it and move it to after the .thead tr
[05:01:22] <Herehere> taplar: Yes it moved, but values inside it are not copied( I'm using datatables )
[05:02:44] <taplar> hmm, not sure then.
[05:02:57] <taplar> are you copying from a non datatabe to a datatable?
[05:03:27] <taplar> because i know datatables had functions specifically for adding new rows
[05:31:58] <prohobo> hi, i have a jquery questions
[05:32:06] <taplar> shoot
[05:32:14] <prohobo> has anyone really been far as decided to use even selector go want to do look more like?
[05:32:30] <taplar> wha?
[05:32:36] <prohobo> yes
[05:32:57] <decx> how is selecto formed?
[05:45:45] <prohobo> how?
[05:57:32] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/vfLmsn8p/ yay! taplar wanna try?
[05:57:35] <Kartagis> heh
[05:57:42] <^rcaskey> hey all, how can i hook into a hidden iframe so that when it is the target of a form post i can get the result?
[05:58:10] <taplar> :)
[05:58:12] <^rcaskey> i'm doing an async upload and it posts through and all is well but i'd like to know when it is complete and do progress updates as well
[06:00:55] <taplar> ^rcaskey: you might try attaching a handler to the load event of the iframe
[06:01:17] <^rcaskey> sounds like a good candidate
[06:01:26] <^rcaskey> any idears on polling for upload progress?
[06:01:55] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/vfLmsn8p/1/ <--- this too :)
[06:02:20] <taplar> never done it, but from a rest standpoint you'd submit your async request which would return to you a url that you can then use to check the progress of it.
[06:02:42] <^rcaskey> yeah...was pondering shoving a progress indicator over long polling
[06:03:14] <taplar> however, is a progress bar a requirement or would a simple spinner suffice?
[06:03:44] <^rcaskey> i'll probably do the spinner but was just wondering if long polling was infact really universal these days or not
[06:04:13] <^rcaskey> and i'm not unsure i won't end up with a socket.io session open for other things anyhoo
[06:04:14] <taplar> my guess would be long polling is still in use more than websockets
[06:04:30] <taplar> but only because of adoption
[06:04:43] <^rcaskey> taplar, http/1.1 long polling isn't web sockets
[06:04:49] <taplar> i know
[06:05:09] <^rcaskey> sorry misread your statemnet
[06:05:10] <jonez> greetings
[06:05:32] <taplar> yo
[06:06:55] <jonez> I need a little help debugging some code I have. the js (which uses jquery) is stored on static.example.com, the url I am loading via .load() is on www.example.com, and a tooltip gets displayed by teos.example.com. I am getting a CORS violation in the console and a "Header add ..." in htaccess did not solve my problem.
[06:08:03] <jonez> the trouble specifically is that when the .load() fires, session cookies are not properly sent to the php on www, so the tooltip content is different.
[06:12:31] <Kartagis> is long pulling another term for push?
[06:12:45] <jonez> no
[06:18:40] <Kartagis> jonez: what is it then?
[06:19:44] <Kartagis> ^rcaskey: my fiddle has got spinner, if you want
[06:20:18] <jonez> Kartagis, it's a poll. that means the B end is polling A end for data. A is not pushing data to B
[06:20:29] <Kartagis> ^rcaskey: also, https://github.com/ConnorAtherton/loaders.css
[06:20:34] <^rcaskey> Kartagis, thx
[06:20:49] <Kartagis> jonez: I'm confused. request?
[06:21:58] <jonez> Kartagis, the key is which end is starting the conversation. if A constantly asks B if it has data, that is a poll, and different from B somehow contacting A to tell it there is data available (which would be a push)
[06:22:44] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling
[06:43:24] <^rcaskey> Kartagis, hrmm im not getting any input back at all actually inside the iframe after the form post
[06:43:52] <^rcaskey> its doing the post and my server side handler is getting called and shoving out data to the response but nothing actually seems to happen client side
[06:43:59] <^rcaskey> no onload events on the iframe, nothing actually appearing in the iframe
[06:47:30] <hellyeah> hey
[06:48:18] <hellyeah> in one browser when i clicked close of one pop up it close all popup window but in other browser it just close the current pop up it remains other pop up open
[06:48:22] <hellyeah> how do you reckon?
[06:49:03] <taplar> hellyeah: depends on how the close handler is finding what it needs to close
[06:50:49] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:50:51] <hellyeah> well
[06:51:09] <hellyeah> can i tell when i close one of pop up close all of them together?
[06:52:30] <taplar> hellyeah: you want to close them all when closing one?
[06:53:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:53:29] <hellyeah> yea but not sure it is effective move
[06:58:19] <hellyeah> taplar:

[06:58:45] <hellyeah> does it make any difference?
[06:58:55] <taplar> sure you can do that
[07:05:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  you there?
[07:06:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:07:01] <hellyeah> i found the solution to close everything
[07:07:11] <hellyeah> humm
[07:08:37] <hellyeah> but
[07:08:51] <hellyeah> when i close pop up window it close all popups thats okey
[07:09:06] <hellyeah> but if i open pop up window it brings the other popu
[07:09:11] <hellyeah> what can be the reason?
[07:18:07] <taplar> bak
[07:18:23] <hellyeah> bak?
[07:18:23] <taplar> hellyeah: i'd have to see what your doing
[07:18:31] <taplar> back
[07:18:41] <taplar> for some reason i hate the c in that word, ;)
[07:18:54] <hellyeah> there is turkish word like that
[07:18:57] <hellyeah> bak means look
[07:18:58] <hellyeah> :D
[07:19:04] <taplar> also bak == back at keyboard
[07:19:14] <taplar> huh
[07:19:37] <tetley> http://jsfiddle.net/ykbgT/8858/#&togetherjs=SG1q8Uftha << why is the div not being reset at the end of animate
[07:20:17] <tetley> just click 3 observant
[07:20:22] <tetley> ill copy the reset
[07:22:28] <taplar> tetley: could be something to do with u changing the selector
[07:22:54] <taplar> if it changes before the animate finishes
[07:24:53] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/93/embedded/result/
[07:25:21] <hellyeah> just open hand icon and image icon on the table
[07:25:29] <tetley> taplar: you must change the selector inorder to animate the clicked one on screen
[07:25:32] <hellyeah> and close tabşe popup
[07:25:37] <hellyeah> and reopen it again
[07:25:57] <tetley> taplar: that part is working however, it keeps animating from the left, when it should be right
[07:28:59] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you have anything for me?
[07:29:05] <taplar> looking
[07:33:16] <taplar> i don't think your doing a close on that modal
[07:34:10] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[07:34:18] <hellyeah> it is #popup2
[07:34:21] <hellyeah> i do .popup2
[07:34:38] <taplar> that id/class is not on the image modal i'm seeing
[07:34:42] <hellyeah> i constantly did silly mistakes until now

[08:48:14] <winegoddess> hi all
[08:48:18] <robertmaxrees> good morning.
[08:48:19] <Palmer11> hi
[09:10:49] <m1su> http://jsfiddle.net/m1su/x9v8onog/4/ < anyone got any idea why i can't pass through additional parameters with trigger while inside another event handler?
[09:14:50] <robertmaxrees> interesting,  you can't trigger on the same element.
[09:14:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x9v8onog/6/
[09:15:46] <m1su> now that is some weird behavious
[09:15:51] <m1su> behaviour*
[09:16:53] <robertmaxrees> strange, sure, but I would suggest avoiding using the extraparameters when possible to beging with.
[09:16:58] <robertmaxrees> *begin
[09:19:19] <m1su> i pretty much haven't ever used it, i guess i'll just find a workaround
[09:19:25] <m1su> thanks anyways
[09:19:26] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[09:19:54] <m1su> got a search input with a normal .blur() and i want to trigger that .blur() inside a .keydown()
[09:20:01] <m1su> basicly when the user presses enter
[09:20:14] <robertmaxrees> do a different abstraction.
[09:20:24] <robertmaxrees> pull the function out and reuse that.
[09:20:29] <robertmaxrees> instead of triggering things.
[09:21:01] <m1su> ye i'll do that
[09:42:57] <notchris> I’m trying to remove all script tags from a page
[09:43:02] <notchris> any suggestions?
[09:43:08] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:43:35] <notchris> Because the system adds them on load and they are uneccesary
[09:43:44] <robertmaxrees> your system?
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a backend issue you need to fix.
[09:43:49] <notchris> I tried $(document).find(‘script’).remove();
[09:44:00] <robertmaxrees> removing the tag doesn't stop the script from running, either way.
[09:44:40] <notchris> Hmmm
[09:44:47] <robertmaxrees> are the scripts interfering with anything?
[09:45:39] <notchris> I guess they are not exactly, but they cannot be edited
[09:45:51] <notchris> So I was going to try to remove them, revise them and re-include them
[09:45:58] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[09:46:00] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[09:46:06] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.  that's a path of pain and regret.
[09:46:14] <notchris> Thank you
[09:46:19] <notchris> I will take your warning haha
[09:46:34] <robertmaxrees> editing code with code and then re-running is a really terrible idea.  why would you do that?
[09:46:35] <notchris> Probably better to just wipe the content on the page (or hide it)
[09:46:47] <notchris> And re-build what I want
[09:48:16] <notchris> How would you recommend hiding content?
[09:48:21] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[09:48:27] <robertmaxrees> what exactly are you doing?
[09:48:27] <notchris> I tried to do *{display:none;}
[09:48:37] <robertmaxrees> becuase this sounds like a really bad idea overall.
[09:48:42] <notchris> OK please be patient with me while I explain
[09:48:47] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[09:48:54] <robertmaxrees> heh - try to be concise.
[09:49:03] <notchris> And note: I work for a non-profit and we cant afford a better system
[09:49:10] <notchris> We have a terrible ticketing system
[09:49:18] <notchris> I’m trying to make it look better, but it’s composed of all tables
[09:49:19] <robertmaxrees> so you're writing a new UI?
[09:49:22] <notchris> Yes
[09:49:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[09:49:31] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[09:49:40] <notchris> I cant edit the html, but I can modify the dom with JS
[09:49:50] <notchris> I can also edit the stylesheet
[09:49:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd setup a server-side system to proxy requests through.
[09:50:07] <notchris> I’m not that familiar with server-side stuff
[09:50:14] <robertmaxrees> then learn.
[09:50:25] <robertmaxrees> it's a great skillset and will solve this problem.
[09:50:47] <notchris> That’s if I can set up a server-side system
[09:50:56] <notchris> Also, the site is built in ASP
[09:51:01] <robertmaxrees> and?
[09:51:09] <robertmaxrees> lol ASP isn't as bad as people like to think it is.
[09:51:25] <notchris> Does it make sense to use it for modern systems?
[09:51:35] <Velveeta> i like to think it's pretty bad, but i'm only slightly (mostly) biased in favor of non-.NET projects :D
[09:51:45] <robertmaxrees> notchris is can.
[09:51:57] <notchris> I realize there are better ways to do this server side
[09:52:03] <robertmaxrees> then do that.
[09:52:14] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you're going to make a really mishmashed, buggy, slow frontend.
[09:52:35] <notchris> Even if it is just a few pages?
[09:52:39] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:54:45] <pi-> Is there any += style way for adding text to a <p id='foo'></p> element?
[09:54:46] <pi-> (I'm trying to make a basic on-page logger)
[09:55:17] <robertmaxrees> pi- not really - $('#foo').text($('#foo').text() + ' some more text'));
[09:55:28] <pi-> I'm trying to find something like $("#hasMidi").appendText(...)
[09:55:51] <robertmaxrees> you can use .append(), but that appends something to the end of the element.
[09:56:03] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't guarantee anything about it being just text
[09:57:02] <pi-> Thanks, .append() is visually clean, if it works I'll use it
[09:59:59] <meowsus> Does anyone have any solutions for storing a jQuery object (with a lot of state stored in $(el).data()) in window.history.state? Obviously there is a deep clone error that's thrown, but I was curious if someone knew of a workaround to preserve all the state that is set on the initial load for when the browser goes back to the original page.
[10:00:44] <robertmaxrees> meowsus there's no real way to do that.  why?
[10:01:22] <meowsus> Yeah, that's what it seems like. AJAXed View All Products + AJAX product result filters.
[10:01:39] <meowsus> Just sloppy with state.
[10:04:17] <sonda> hello all
[10:04:26] <sonda> i am new to jquery
[10:04:41] <meowsus> Hello sonda
[10:05:10] <sonda> i want to convert jquery splitter widget to angular
[10:05:23] <sonda> i have the jquery code
[10:05:33] <sonda> just wondering how to port
[10:05:36] <meowsus> robertmaxrees: I can pretty recreate the state fairly easily, but it would be killer to be like window.history.pushState($el) and it be returned in the state that it was originally pushed. Simple.
[10:05:45] <meowsus> Wishful thinking.
[10:07:24] <taplar> sonda: kinda sounds more like an angular question
[10:07:32] <sonda> http://pastebin.com/udi0TGed
[10:07:40] <sonda> here is the jquery code
[10:08:05] <sonda> the very first line I could not understand
[10:08:23] <sonda> (function($, undefined) {
[10:08:42] <sonda> what does $ mean
[10:08:47] <robertmaxrees> sonda that's an IIFE>
[10:08:50] <pi-> Can I add an appendLine(L) method to $, that will do $('#foo').text(  $('#foo').text() + '\n' + L  ); ?
[10:08:51] <robertmaxrees> !g ben alman iife
[10:09:04] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[10:09:08] <robertmaxrees> sonda read this ^
[10:09:16] <sonda> ok
[10:09:26] <robertmaxrees> pi- you could - check out the articles in the learning center about making plugins.
[10:09:38] <robertmaxrees> meowsus i'd store json and construct things as appropriate.
[10:10:29] <sonda> learning center url please
[10:11:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean... http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+learning+center
[10:11:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:11:54] <skinux> I need help getting one of these modals to work: https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/04c88ef1ba43cd889fa8
[10:12:21] <tetley> http://jsfiddle.net/ykbgT/8872/ << hello all, is the callback of the .animate running?
[10:12:21] <pi-> heh that is exactly what lmgtfy is for
[10:12:23] <robertmaxrees> skinux make a fiddle?
[10:12:31] <skinux> Sure.
[10:16:01] <skinux> My intent to be able to use the modal like I would an alert() http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/ru412me6/
[10:18:59] <robertmaxrees> js errors in the console btw.
[10:22:09] <skinux> Yeah, it says e is not defined, which I don't understand because I thought that was built-in to JS.
[10:22:17] <robertmaxrees> it is, but you have to pass it.
[10:23:13] <skinux> I don't know how to pass something that I haven't created.
[10:23:32] <robertmaxrees> $('a').on('event', function(e) {});
[10:23:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:24:20] <skinux> It's in a function, not an event handler
[10:24:40] <skinux> I put it in the parens of the function, but it didn't solve it.
[10:24:41] <robertmaxrees> which function?
[10:24:45] <skinux> clsoeInfo
[10:24:51] <skinux> closeInfo*
[10:25:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing where that even gets called.
[10:25:12] <robertmaxrees> and same story - closeInfo(e)
[10:25:21] <robertmaxrees> then it's passed in byt he binding.
[10:25:41] <robertmaxrees> if you're not calling that via an event binding, you're not going to have the object.
[10:37:43] <skinux> What I'm trying to do is be able to call that function when after AJAX response is received.
[10:41:24] <taplar> skinux: you might want to break apart that function then.  whatever event uses it would call function A that cancels the event and calls function B.  for ajax responses they would just call function B
[10:41:46] <tetley> fixed my fiddle problem if anyone cares to know
[10:42:59] <skinux> Actually...I don't think I need to prevent default at all, because there is no event being captured for that.
[10:43:48] <taplar> so it's not attached to a link any where?
[10:48:45] <skinux> Well, there is a link, but it has nothing to do with that function.
[10:49:02] <skinux> In fact, the link doesn't even show on the page for some reason.
[11:11:06] <hispanzso> Hey. robertmaxrees: cork: arthurvr: anyone around for a q?
[11:11:14] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel, yo.
[11:11:25] <hispanzso> alright.
[11:11:27] <robertmaxrees> we're not the only ones who are allowed to ;)
[11:11:37] <hispanzso> and where's arthurvr, by the way?
[11:11:41] <taplar> i killed him
[11:11:44] <robertmaxrees> no clue...
[11:11:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:11:54] <taplar> he called me stapler
[11:12:04] <taplar> we don't play around
[11:13:25] <robertmaxrees> hispanzso did you have a question?
[11:13:38] <arthurvr> Eyyyy everybody
[11:13:40] <Uhkis> he already asked it, where is arthurvr :D
[11:13:50] <taplar> ZOMBIE!!!
[11:14:00] <arthurvr> hispanzso: don’t PM instead ask in this channel :)
[11:14:09] <robertmaxrees> i knew that would happen lol
[11:14:33] <jak2000> how to create a pdf with jQuery?  or. how to print something to printer when user press PRINT button?
[11:15:08] <hispanzso> so I have
[11:15:08] <hispanzso> foo = { 1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c' }
[11:15:09] <taplar> jak2000: in my experience, easiest was is to display the pdf in an iframe and use the built in print functionality
[11:15:16] <hispanzso> and want to iterate on it using each()
[11:15:19] <hispanzso> but not working
[11:15:27] <robertmaxrees> hispanzso that's like a psuedo array.
[11:15:33] <robertmaxrees> why not use an actual array?
[11:15:35] <hispanzso> in mobile safari, the rest works fine.
[11:15:44] <hispanzso> robertmaxrees: the data comes from an api
[11:15:54] <robertmaxrees> yuck.
[11:15:54] <arthurvr> hispanzso: jQuery version?
[11:16:08] <robertmaxrees> either way, $.each(foo, function() {});
[11:16:14] <hispanzso> 2.1.1
[11:16:17] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use Object.keys()
[11:16:30] <arthurvr> hispanzso: update to latest
[11:16:36] <arthurvr> we fixed a bug IIRC
[11:16:48] <jak2000> taplar how to? have any url for learn? or wich look in google?
[11:16:51] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: it should work on array-like’s
[11:17:08] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr i thought he was trying to use foo.each();
[11:17:49] <hispanzso> so you suggest to update to 2.1.4? should work give me a second
[11:17:49] <taplar> jak2000: google iframes if your unfamiliar.  pdfs, by default, have functionality tied to them when hovering over them like next/previous page, other stuff, and print is one of them
[11:17:51] <Uhkis> jak2000: window.print() should open up the print dialog
[11:17:59] <hispanzso> robertmaxrees: $.each()
[11:18:57] <hispanzso> IT WORKS!! i've been debugging this for hours!!
[11:19:08] <taplar> i'd show an example, but its an intranet site so can't realy
[11:19:28] <arthurvr> hispanzso: Yay! Next time please don’t PM; this channel is awesome :p
[11:19:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ this all day :)
[11:19:46] <arthurvr> but glad it’s fixed
[11:19:49] <arthurvr> :)
[11:20:01] <jak2000> Uhkis not window.print print the curreent html window, and i want generate a diferent presentation
[11:20:16] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you just open the pdf.  let the user decide what to do from there.
[11:20:37] <skinux> robertmaxrees: Can you just help me get this modal to show and "close", I removed the second one. https://gist.github.com/skinuxgeek/04c88ef1ba43cd889fa8
[11:20:54] <robertmaxrees> skinux you had JS errors last i looked.  update the fiddle?
[11:22:04] <robertmaxrees> and I'm not the only person available to help :)
[11:22:35] <jak2000> robertmaxrees but i need generate first
[11:22:38] <jak2000> how to?
[11:22:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 look for a library.
[11:22:59] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of hard to do clinet-side.
[11:23:02] <jak2000> in java channel (i am work with jsp)surial> jak2000: You can use CSS .media(print) to make different HTML print than show. tell me:
[11:23:03] <robertmaxrees> *client
[11:23:05] <skinux> http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/ru412me6/1/
[11:23:16] <jak2000> robertmaxrees wich library?
[11:23:22] <taplar> yeah, creating pdfs is kinda, well, not fun
[11:23:25] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 search google.  lots of choices.
[11:23:38] <robertmaxrees> skinux still getting errors on load - ReferenceError: Handsontable is not defined
[11:23:57] <skinux> Oh...that's because I didn't get the fiddle setup with that library
[11:24:13] <robertmaxrees> skinux so make a more barebones one :)
[11:24:46] <skinux> I don't know how to setup the fiddle with it because it's a downloaded library...
[11:25:11] <robertmaxrees> skinux does that library actually matter in this case?  i thought you had a question about a modal.
[11:25:56] <jak2000> taplar then wich is the way? css media print or Jquery generate PDF? wich recommend me?
[11:26:15] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 those do two different things.
[11:26:19] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what is your use case?
[11:26:27] <taplar> i can't recommend.  never built a pdf with jquery.  didn't know javascript had that capability myself
[11:26:53] <jak2000> i have a webpage HTLM with some data, some tables, i want print it to my printer
[11:27:09] <robertmaxrees> then generate a page and print it.
[11:28:15] <jak2000> ok
[11:29:03] <skinux> Here it is without the spreadsheet JS. http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/ru412me6/3/
[11:30:06] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting the "id" from?
[11:31:32] <skinux> Which id?
[11:31:39] <robertmaxrees> $(id).fadeIn(2000);
[11:32:05] <robertmaxrees> i also don't see any bindings or anything.  i'm confused by what you're trying to do here.
[11:32:45] <skinux> My bad..updated it again
[11:33:38] <skinux> When data is saved to server via AJAX/JSON request, inside the .done function I want to show the modal informing user the data has been saved. That is my goal here.
[11:33:39] <robertmaxrees> link?
[11:35:32] <skinux> http://jsfiddle.net/skinux/ru412me6/4/
[11:35:56] <robertmaxrees> lol that's not a valid selector.  i'll fix that for you ;)
[11:36:25] <robertmaxrees> so for a basic fiddle, you don't need so much stuff btw.
[11:36:28] <skinux> Sorry...I'm trying to learn this stuff.
[11:37:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ru412me6/6/
[11:38:07] <skinux> I'm confused
[11:38:11] <robertmaxrees> by what?
[11:38:22] <skinux> I thought Modals were kind of like popup windows inside of the page....
[11:38:25] <robertmaxrees> they are.
[11:38:33] <robertmaxrees> did you need help with the styling?
[11:39:03] <skinux> I don't know..maybe
[11:39:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:39:21] <skinux> I want the Modal showing up over the top of the spreadsheet. not above or below it.
[11:39:36] <robertmaxrees> so then you need help with styling it.  there a reason you're not using a modaling library?
[11:39:51] <skinux> Yeah....didn't know there was one.
[11:40:07] <robertmaxrees> jqModal is one.
[11:40:13] <robertmaxrees> if you have bootstrap, you can us that one.
[11:40:18] <robertmaxrees> jquery-mdal is another...
[11:40:33] <otterpaw> How do you set the time until timeout for $.ajax to a high value?  The {timeout: number} option seems to be capped at something like 5 seconds, even if I wrap it as $.ajaxSetup({timeout: 30 * 60 * 1000});
[11:41:25] <robertmaxrees> otterpaw timeout within the options.
[11:41:31] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax({timeout: 5000});
[11:41:49] <otterpaw> I've tried that and it still times out and resets after ~5 seconds
[11:42:01] <otterpaw> Despite setting it for 10-30 minutes
[11:42:14] <robertmaxrees> there's an upper limit on how long that can go iirc.
[11:42:40] <robertmaxrees> the server-side also has its own timeout.
[11:43:00] <robertmaxrees> the language/framework and server itself both probably have limiuts.
[11:43:03] <robertmaxrees> *limits
[11:43:11] <otterpaw> Really?  I'm running an express.js backend and I thought it would wait for my res.send
[11:43:27] <robertmaxrees> i would read around.  what server are you proxying through?
[11:43:55] <notchris> Why cant you get the text of a hidden element with .text();
[11:43:56] <notchris> ?
[11:44:01] <robertmaxrees> you can.
[11:44:04] <notchris> Weird
[11:44:10] <notchris> Wasn’t working for me, I’ll try again
[11:44:37] <otterpaw> Its a big query to an internal server that's done in small chunks in order to reduce server load.  It takes ~10 minutes in total and I want to return a success/failure message.
[11:44:47] <otterpaw> Would it be better to just set up polling or something?
[11:44:58] <robertmaxrees> or use sockets with a push notification.
[11:45:20] <robertmaxrees> even better - have a submit form that checks to see if the query is already running and enables/disables/etc based on that.
[11:45:24] <otterpaw> that's true, I'll look into that
[11:45:32] <robertmaxrees> have another place that shows last result, currently running robs, et.c
[11:45:49] <otterpaw> Well, I've been disabling on send, and I have a backend mutex to block it.
[14:14:39] <serversides> Hi there, I have a <ul> with about 20 li’s with img child <li> <img src=“hello.jpg” /> </li> , How can I go about duplicating the entire 20 rows of <li> with the <img> as child aslo?
[14:14:54] <robertmaxrees> why not dupe the UL entirely?
[14:15:52] <serversides> because then ill have 2 unordered lists with 20 li’s in each, or is that wrong?  I want to have 40 li’s with img childs in the same ul
[14:16:03] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[14:16:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/c4vakoro/
[14:16:50] <robertmaxrees> though now i wonder - why are you duplicating things?
[14:19:11] <serversides> robertmaxrees: thankyou!  I am duplicating the list because I have a jquery plugin that is stubborn and wont reinitilize easily.   Basically it sorts 40 images into a 10x10 grid.  When I destroy it it leaves 20 images, so on reinitialization it doesn have the other 20 to image swap :P
[14:19:26] <robertmaxrees> okay
[14:20:09] <serversides> thanks for your help :)
[14:20:51] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:27:14] <alexclark> im trying to do a get request with dataType jsonp because of cors and I keep getting a missing semicolon error
[14:29:39] <robertmaxrees> share your code then.
[14:31:37] <gambl0re> how do you center an element horizontally and vertically using jquery
[14:31:48] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[14:35:08] <alexclark> any help on using jsonp for get requests?
[14:35:20] <robertmaxrees> alexclark i responded.
[14:35:23] <robertmaxrees> share your code :)
[14:35:33] <alexclark> oh ok
[14:38:02] <alexclark> https://gist.github.com/alexclarkofficial/cc827829b5e9b58e46d0
[14:39:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid jsonp setup.
[14:41:10] <illio> Trying to detect an accordion being completely collapsed. I can get the current active "tab" like so: $("#questions").accordion( "option", "active" ) .. However if all are collapsed, it just defaults to 0 (i.e. the first one)..
[14:42:19] <robertmaxrees> alexclark you have to do a little more than that.
[14:42:37] <robertmaxrees> your server needs to return the data in a function call.
[14:42:57] <robertmaxrees> the function call is defined by the callback param.
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> illio i'm confused.  what do tabs have to do with accordions?
[14:43:21] <alexclark> like callback(theJSONPayload)
[14:43:24] <alexclark> ?
[14:43:36] <robertmaxrees> alexclark yes, but 'callback' is whatever string to passed in.
[14:43:59] <alexclark> ok, thanks
[14:44:05] <illio> robertmaxrees, Poor choice of words. I just called each "part" of the accordion "tabs" in my code.. Basically what I want to detect is that all parts of the accordion are collapsed
[14:44:36] <robertmaxrees> illio except that there's only one "part" to an accordion.  do you have multiple accordions stacked or something?
[14:45:46] <illio> robertmaxrees, No there's not: https://jqueryui.com/accordion/ .. The example here has 4 parts.. You get the active part by calling  $("#someID").accordion( "option", "active" )
[14:46:13] <robertmaxrees> ah, that.
[14:46:28] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know if all 4 parts are collapsed?  sounds like you figured that part out.
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> oh, except for the default bit.
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:46:54] <illio> robertmaxrees, Yes, that's what I want to detect, but it just returns the 1st as the active.. As if the first was opened.
[14:47:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry - out of it today :)  so why do you need this?  i wonder if there's another way to approach this.
[14:48:45] <illio> robertmaxrees, It's for a crowdsourcing experiment where workers can open/collapse individual questions as they move along. An indicator tells them what they can do under each question and this differs from question to question. If no questions are open (i.e., all collapsed), the indicator needs to show that the worker can do nothing.. but I can't detect the full collapse, so I can't change it.
[14:50:14] <robertmaxrees> interesting: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m5ufk28t/
[14:50:15] <robertmaxrees> works here.
[14:50:18] <shoky> illio: it returns false when all are collapsed
[14:50:29] <robertmaxrees> shoky yeah, just made a fiddle for that.
[14:50:42] <shoky> yep i see ;)
[14:52:25] <illio> Hmm.. that's odd? I wonder why it returns 1 on my end. It's the site here: http://illio.dk/CrowdFilter.php?doc=7&assignmentId=1&hitId=1&workerId=1
[14:52:53] <robertmaxrees> setup a console log or something.
[14:53:53] <robertmaxrees> works here...
[14:54:48] <illio> Hmm.. and now I can't reproduce the error :-) .. This is a weird night so far.. This was totally not working 20 minutes ago. I changed a few lines of code, but I'm not at all sure what did the trick. It's returning false for me as well now.
[14:55:04] <robertmaxrees> caching i'll guess.
[14:58:22] <illio> robertmaxrees, sounds likely.. thanks for the help though :-)
[15:06:50] <sl33k_> What am I doing wrong? Can't get any data through AJAX? http://pastebin.com/VUdwFfYi
[15:07:21] <robertmaxrees> sl33k_ getting any errors or anything?
[15:07:50] <sl33k_> robertmaxrees: Nope. Just no data populated
[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> check the network tab and see if it's there?
[15:08:31] <sl33k_> And the network tab in firebug is blank.
[15:08:44] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:09:00] <robertmaxrees> really unfamiliar with datatables.  somebody else might now, or you could hit up their forums.
[15:14:29] <Ikarus_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31664130/jquery-bind-event-with-handler
[15:15:03] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:16:00] <illio> robertmaxrees, And now it's doing it again :-) .. http://illio.dk/CrowdFilter.php?doc=7&assignmentId=1&hitId=1&workerId=1 .. Cleared the cache.. didn't do the trick. Totally odd.
[15:16:18] <robertmaxrees> illio works fine here.
[15:16:30] <robertmaxrees> share your other code i guess.
[15:20:00] <illio> robertmaxrees, *facepalm*.. I just found the error. It's a very stupid one. To avoid code duplication I do this before doing a switch: "var activeTab = $("#questions").accordion( "option", "active" )+1;" .. Which of course means it calculates 1 regardless of whether the function returns 0 or false... sigh.. JavaScript types
[15:20:13] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:20:15] <illio> dynamic typing is a bitch sometimes.
[15:20:29] <robertmaxrees> coercion, too ;)
[15:21:08] <illio> :-)
[17:01:08] <YokoBR> hi guys
[17:01:13] <ycon_> Hi all, I really need help with this jQuery error I've been trying to solve for days
[17:01:24] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ shoot.
[17:01:28] <ycon_> It's here: http://www.stashdapp.com/prize/
[17:01:29] <nodist> ycon_ do you have a paste?
[17:01:31] <nodist> cool
[17:01:55] <ycon_> When I click, it gives me an error. It's conflicting with some jquery that's within that SMS thing (i've loaded jquery scripts there too)
[17:02:06] <robertmaxrees> click what?
[17:02:20] <YokoBR> Guys, i have two fields var pass = $('#password').val(); and var rpass = $('#rpasswd').val(); and i want to compare them before sending my form
[17:02:21] <ycon_> the "Click to open me! " etc at the top
[17:02:34] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ where are you calling jQuery.sendFormPps?
[17:03:00] <YokoBR> so i did if (pass != rpasswd){ alert("error");} but it's not working
[17:03:08] <ycon_> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure. All I know is if I remove the SMS thing (which calls jquery too) it works
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ http://www.stashdapp.com/wp-content/cache/minify/000000/M9QvyC8oLdBNqtQtLi0oriwuyUzWzyrWT84vSgUA.js
[17:03:37] <robertmaxrees> in here.
[17:03:50] <robertmaxrees> no idea what that is, but that usually means you're not loading something before trying to use it.
[17:04:36] <robertmaxrees> related to https://wordpress.org/support/topic/popup-is-not-displayed
[17:04:58] <robertmaxrees> i would check to make sure you're not loading jquery more than once.
[17:05:05] <ycon_> yes saw this. Removed tminifty function
[17:05:16] <ycon_> I am loading jquery more than once as the SMS function is loading it
[17:05:26] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ that'll cause it.
[17:05:31] <robertmaxrees> YokoBR can you makje a fiddle or something?
[17:06:01] <ycon_> If I remove the jquery, from the SMS, then it breaks the SMS function
[17:06:17] <YokoBR> okay, robertmaxrees
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ is it scoped properly to the sms function?
[17:06:40] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ because that's causing your issue.
[17:06:45] <ycon_> scoped? It's within the "<script>" tags
[17:06:56] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ using noconflict or something similar, i mean.
[17:07:50] <ycon_> can I use noconflict for the entire jquery file within the sms?
[17:08:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to edit "the sms" to do that.
[17:08:13] <robertmaxrees> which is a bad idea.
[17:08:18] <robertmaxrees> but https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[17:09:19] <ycon_> wouldthe noconflict be the actual error/fuction line?
[17:09:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:09:39] <robertmaxrees> the issue you have two things trying to declare the jQuery object.
[17:10:05] <YokoBR> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/11e9ygcx/1/
[17:10:30] <robertmaxrees> YokoBR invalid code somewhere.
[17:11:12] <robertmaxrees> ah, bad return.
[17:11:25] <ycon_> robertmaxrees: do you have a work around to suggest? I'm open to suggestions
[17:11:45] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ not really.  wordpress breaks my brain.  try another plugin?
[17:13:05] <robertmaxrees> YokoBR also, <input type="button" id="#cadastra" value="submit" > is wrong - you want just id="cadestra"
[17:13:10] <ycon_> robertmaxrees: Can you suggest in my fiddle how to use the no conflict feature within the sms function? http://jsfiddle.net/5pfkugyc/
[17:13:28] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ did you read the page i link?
[17:13:36] <robertmaxrees> because you'd need to edit the plugin.
[17:13:38] <robertmaxrees> which is a bad idea.
[17:13:43] <ycon_> I did- but jquery very new
[17:13:45] <ycon_> ahh
[17:14:03] <ycon_> so making the SMS's jquery file no.conflict is not possible?
[17:14:03] <YokoBR> oops
[17:14:14] <robertmaxrees> ycon_ i wouldn't do that.  that's also not where the bug is.
[17:14:20] <YokoBR> i've changed to id="cadastra", but still no deal
[17:14:22] <robertmaxrees> it's that modal/popup library.
[17:14:24] <robertmaxrees> use another one.
[17:14:30] <robertmaxrees> YokoBR you're aslo not targeting any of the element son that page.
[17:15:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/11e9ygcx/6/ this is closer.
[17:19:56] <ycon_> robertmaxrees: I'll edit the plugin. Where shoudl I be trying to use the "no.conflcit" mode?
[17:24:30] <YokoBR> so it's not possible to compare two fields on beforesend ?
[17:36:19] <ycon_> robertmaxrees: think I'll do it in pure css instead...
[18:02:27] <ycon_> Hi, I'm trying to troubleshoot this jQuery error (another) http://www.stashdapp.com/prize
[18:02:56] <ycon_> It pops-out, but I cant close it
[18:36:10] <ISmithers> When I animate a position change on mouse scroll for an element, its very jerky (I assume because the mouse scrolls in discrete blocks).
[18:36:13] <ISmithers> Is there a way to smooth this?
[19:30:11] <jak2000> hi all how to change the value of a cell in a html table?
[20:42:26] <phiz> w powers
[21:08:17] <albedoa> if i have an object var myObj = {$myElem: $('<div>')} how do i access $myElem with append()? is it append(myObj.$myElem) ?
[21:23:53] <jak2000> hi all how to change the value of a cell in a html table?
[22:37:46] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:39:09] <mdev> good morning gurke
[22:39:17] <mdev> how'd you come up with that nick?
[22:55:56] <gurke_> mdev why you asking?
[23:02:27] <d3m0n> I have a unordered list and several inputs with unique names. How can I check if an input has a specifc name it adds a class to the list?
[23:03:08] <d3m0n> These are seperate elements
[23:06:39] <SirLagz> d3m0n: $('input').find() ?
[23:07:01] <d3m0n> SirLagz: They're seperate elements with no relation to each other
[23:07:14] <SirLagz> $('input') will find all inputs in the page
[23:07:22] <SirLagz> will select rather
[23:07:22] <d3m0n> No the find part
[23:07:45] <SirLagz> d3m0n: pretty sure find will just find what you specify for all inputs
[23:08:26] <d3m0n> find looks through the descendants elements
[23:08:27] <SirLagz> d3m0n: not sure if it would take a 'name=blah' but it's a starting point
[23:08:47] <d3m0n> There are no descendants of the input element
[23:09:46] <d3m0n> But the name attribute gives me an idea
[23:11:37] <SirLagz> d3m0n: right. got my find confused with something else.
[23:13:35] <SirLagz> d3m0n: the long way around would be to do a $.each on $('input'), and check the name attribute and do something if it matches
[23:13:40] <SirLagz> d3m0n: i'm sure there's a better way though
[23:14:23] <d3m0n> I think I'll add data-* to th list item
[23:14:28] <d3m0n> Then reference in the input function
[23:15:48] <mdev> SirLagz you probably can match using regexp
[23:16:08] <mdev> personally though i'd go with the .each solution because I like simple code I can read
[23:16:13] <mdev> and edit easily
[23:16:20] <mdev> in terms of speed, no idea which would be better
[23:16:23] <d3m0n> regex wouldn't work because the input data could be different
[23:16:23] <SirLagz> mdev: yeah, personally that's what I'd do too
[23:16:58] <d3m0n> I think data-* is the cleanest
[23:17:42] <SirLagz> d3m0n: make it whatever is going to be the easiest to maintain :P
[23:17:58] <d3m0n> Yeah just looking for suggestions on how
[23:18:08] <SirLagz> d3m0n: $.each on $('input') is easy
[23:18:41] <d3m0n> The name is different on each input
[23:18:51] <d3m0n> So I'd be doing the same thing with data-* I suppose
[23:18:55] <SirLagz> d3m0n: yep
