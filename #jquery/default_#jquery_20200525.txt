[01:00:21] <Cork> ark: you could bind a resize event on the window object
[01:00:37] <Cork> for the dealy there is setTimeout
[01:00:44] <ark> can you please show me by editing the dpaste?
[01:04:03] <Cork> ark: we're here to help you figure out your problems, not write your code
[01:04:13] <Cork> git it a try if you get stuck ask again
[01:04:19] <Cork> give *
[01:05:46] <Cork> for the delay https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout
[01:07:33] <ark> and this for resize? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/641857/javascript-window-resize-event
[01:08:13] <Cork> just bind it like you normaly do
[01:08:21] <Cork> just do $(windows) instead of giving it a string
[01:08:40] <ark> i don't know how to do that i have 0 training in javascript & jquery
[01:09:04] <Cork> https://learn.jquery.com/
[01:09:11] <ark> this is like my only code for it on my sdite
[01:10:01] <ark> i don't want to learn if it is just for this 1 thing i am kind of on a time crunch to launch this site since corona made me jobless
[01:11:35] <Cork> then => ##freelance
[01:11:42] <Cork> and find someone willing to do it for you
[01:11:50] <ark> does that cost $?
[01:12:08] <Cork> of course if you want someone else to do you job it costs
[01:12:24] <ark> guess i just won't worry about it then
[01:12:38] <ark> make my users suffer unfortunately
[01:12:51] <Cork> well it is your choise
[02:20:00] <impostord> im also getting this https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3273 on windows 10 ie11.
[02:20:32] <impostord> something very strange is happening in the css feature detection code: computeStyleTests()
[02:20:58] <impostord> unfortunately, im unable to reproduce but I think it's related to the resize event in window.
[02:22:53] <impostord> the minified version of 3.2.1 uses the comma operator: https://bpa.st/JBKA   could there possibly be an issue there in ie11? perhaps setting the var to be null prematurely?
[02:24:15] <impostord> as far as I can tell it must be window.getComputedStyle that causes the style property to be set to null
[02:34:51] <Cork> impostord: not likely minification causes it, that would cause parsing errors not execution value errors
[02:35:16] <Cork> sounds more like a dom reference is lost in gc or something like that
[02:42:01] <impostord> Cork: yeah
[02:42:16] <impostord> and the function run to completion before other code right?
[02:42:53] <Cork> what function?
[02:43:03] <Cork> you mean gc?
[02:43:22] <impostord> the computeStyleTests() runs to completion before other code can run yes?
[02:43:30] <Cork> yes it isn't async
[08:23:42] <errorous> hi. can someone tell me why this doesn't work? https://jsfiddle.net/enwmbc89/2/
[08:23:52] <errorous> ie, why click events aren't attached to buttons
[08:24:40] <Cork> your looking for <body class="tr"> and it doesn't exist
[08:25:25] <Cork> also i would prob just bind the click handler on table instead of on tr
[08:25:37] <errorous> Cork if I change it to just tr it still doesn't work
[08:26:39] <Cork> errorous: well the list of errors are quite long actually., 1.body doean't have a class tr, 2. tr isn't valid outside of table, thead or tbody, 3. button isn't valid inside tr only td or th is
[08:27:23] <Cork> so currently tr won't get any click from buttons as there won't be any inside them (dom error correction will move then outside)
[08:27:49] <errorous> ok, so if I fix html it seems to be working
[08:28:06] <errorous> https://jsfiddle.net/bqmr3vg6/4/
[08:28:53] <Cork> errorous: $('table').on('click', 'button.a, button.n', function() { })
[08:28:59] <Cork> don't bind more handlers then you need
[08:29:13] <Cork> opps s/button.n/button.b/
[14:30:33] <igcewieling> I don't use jQuery or JS much.   Currently I know of two different ways to do ajax calls with jQuery.  1) $.ajax with success, error, and complete handlers 2) $ajax with .then, .done, .fail, .always    Is one method recommended over the other when I don't need promises and deferreds or perhaps a different method?
[21:30:14] <jiffe> I seem to be having some trouble sending cookies in an ajax post
[21:30:44] <jiffe> the cookie is set from www.domain.tld and I'm making a post request to api.domain.tld
[21:31:09] <jiffe> the set-cookie contains ; domain=.domain.tld
[21:33:14] <jiffe> if I use withCredentials: true in the request it does send the cookie but then complains about CORS, if I don't set withCredentials: true it doesn't complain about CORS but it doesn't send the cookie either
[22:47:51] <shoky_> fix the CORS issue then
[23:48:06] <_savage> How can I select only N siblings from the current $(this)? prevUntil() or siblings() takes only selectors but no functions where I'd count. There's no real range selector, although one for childrenâ€¦
[23:52:56] <shoky_> _savage: .prevAll().slice(0, N)
[23:54:08] <_savage> shoky_: Hm, does that first create an object with all siblings and THEN slice? Because the prevAll could potentially be very large, only to slice a tiny bit off.
[23:54:47] <_savage> shoky_: which makes me wonder if iteratively add()-ing ten times might be faster
[23:54:51] <shoky_> yes. how large..?  most likely you're fine
[23:56:00] <_savage> shoky_: several thousands, depending on the user input
[23:56:43] <_savage> Hmm: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3461863/how-do-i-select-the-next-n-elements-starting-from-the-current-element-in-jquer
[23:57:37] <shoky_> i doubt it'd matter or be noticable
