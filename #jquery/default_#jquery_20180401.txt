[16:05:26] <leothenarwhal> Hi all, i have a table with items and certain icons to (for example) delete the entry from the list. What would be the best way to delete a item on icon click and how do i give an id so i can reference to id to the object in the database?
[16:06:16] <Woet> leothenarwhal: what have you tried so far?
[16:07:11] <leothenarwhal> Woet: i was thinking about adding onclick events for the icons, however i dont really have an idea how to pass the idea to the binded function
[16:07:27] <Woet> leothenarwhal: 'this'
[16:07:54] <leothenarwhal> what would this yield me here?
[16:08:02] <leothenarwhal> the full table cell or?
[16:08:06] <Woet> leothenarwhal: try it and see
[16:16:21] <leothenarwhal> Woet: thanks!
[16:16:31] <Woet> leothenarwhal: you did all the work
[17:40:33] <JohnDoe2> http://jsbin.com/teduvoguwa/edit?js,console,output can't figure this crap out and the error message is misleading. .labels() is a function of the jQuery version I'm using, as opposed to what the error message says.
[17:48:42] <JohnDoe2> nvm, going to use vanilla JS
[18:38:53] <LooneyToones> ooooh there's people here
[18:39:43] <LooneyToones> perhaps daft question.... .text() is it functionally similar to console.log("anything in quotes is a string"), console.log(anything not in quotes could be variable);?
[19:37:26] <LooneyToones> zzzzzz
