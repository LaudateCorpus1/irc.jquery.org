[04:01:18] <Dro> Hello, how can I find all table having "border" attribute with jquery ?
[04:14:30] <robertmaxrees> Dro you'd use an attribute selector.
[04:15:04] <robertmaxrees> something like $('table[border]') Dro
[04:15:51] <Dro> robertmaxrees: thank you.. How can I loop TDs in a table object please ?
[04:16:01] <robertmaxrees> you use .each()
[04:16:16] <robertmaxrees> .find() to find the tds.
[04:16:24] <robertmaxrees> and then .each() for your enumeration.
[04:17:17] <robertmaxrees> should check out https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/ for info on the basics :)
[04:18:41] <Dro> Thank you, how ever I can't use .each() in a table object (already tried) :
[04:18:42] <Dro>                 $(this).each(function() {
[04:18:42] <Dro>                    console.log($(this));
[04:18:43] <Dro>                 });
[04:18:53] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code in the channel.
[04:18:53] <Dro> $(this) == the table object
[04:18:59] <Dro> yes sorry, I forgot :$
[04:19:03] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the table.
[04:19:08] <Dro> console.log print the table
[04:19:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to use .find() to get the tds.
[04:19:11] <Dro> instead of TD
[04:21:18] <Dro> thank you it works now
[04:21:41] <robertmaxrees> check out that link I sent earlier - it's got some great info for you.
[04:21:49] <Dro> robertmaxrees: is there a way to do something like .find(td OR th) ?
[04:21:58] <Dro> robertmaxrees: thank you for the link, I'll check it ^^
[04:22:10] <robertmaxrees> sure - how would you do it in CSS?
[04:23:21] <Dro> find('th,td') works ! :D
[04:23:26] <robertmaxrees> :)
[04:23:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery selectors are a superset of CSS selectors - there are some custom extensions, but all css selectors should work.
[04:25:08] <Dro> Great! thanks for the infos

[12:05:35] <goddard> if I have a normal html element can i still append/prepend on it?
[12:05:35] <goddard> like normal javascript element not jquery
[12:16:46] <goddard> nvm
