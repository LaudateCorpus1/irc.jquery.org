[00:25:35] <zly9> Hey guys I have an element that has a dynamic top margin depending on the window size.. I want to subtract from that value during a scroll function I have, how can I do that here jQuery(".mainSlideImage").css("margin-top", <current-margin-top> - scrollTop / 10);
[00:25:48] <zly9> scrollTop being defined earlier
[00:27:18] <acidjazz> are you out of your element
[00:43:25] <dakshgautam> hey
[00:44:55] <arc_> Ou42 this page would be the mdn alternative to what you linked https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation
[00:45:10] <arc_> mdn is better than w3schools in every case
[00:46:03] <arc_> it's unfortunate that w3schools is usually returned first in google search results, but if you just put mdn after, your life will improve :p
[00:47:01] <Ou42> ty
[00:47:54] <Ou42> I'm still not sure what's so bad about w3schools... anybody?
[00:48:17] <arc_> they give poor examples that are poorly explained
[00:48:21] <arc_> they have incomplete information
[00:48:47] <arc_> also, mdn has extensive data about browser support for every single thing you could possibly want
[00:50:47] <arc_> if you just start using mdn you will start to see how much better it is
[00:51:12] <Ou42> ty for the cool / contained response. I'll try to check out mdn. FYI, it was brayden_'s q.
[00:51:31] <arc_> ya i know, but it seemed like you wanted an explanation for his outburst :p
[00:52:13] <Ou42> true true... as he pointed out i've been "blinded" by w3. I've liked it. simple and to the point. granted I haven't found everything there, but it's been a good starting place.
[00:52:22] <Ou42> maybe i just like the color scheme. :D
[01:03:23] <Ou42> anybody have xp w/ tables in jQM?
[01:25:09] <Ou42> ah-ha!
[01:25:25] <Ou42> sorta.
[01:25:33] <Ou42> it has changed!
[01:25:45] <Ou42> OK. so what exactly is a table rebuild?
[02:04:54] <Ou42> it's refresh
[02:04:59] <Ou42> not rebuild. go figure.
[02:05:45] <Ou42> also, dunno how I was supposed to make the mental jump: .table("refresh") == error init first ==> .table().table("refresh")
[02:05:55] <Ou42> but ... it ... is .... working!
[02:54:35] <socialblogsite> Does anybody understand what this example means? (found in a “JS code” field as its placeholder)    '@':images[i] (jQuery)
[03:42:38] <robhol> wut.
[04:06:27] <mota> I'm fairly new to jquery. I've written a page which has around 30 sparklines (http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about) that are regularly refreshed by reloading a couple of json files. In 6 hours, this page will go from around 30MB memory consumed ... to around 500MB.
[04:07:22] <mota> Any tips for finding and fixing whatever causes this continual memory increase?
[04:07:25] <Nasp> Then you are leaking memory
[04:08:04] <mota> indeed
[04:16:09] <mota> Here's the page code: https://gist.github.com/bklockwood/90cf389ab119460d5edd
[04:17:01] <mota> ... if anyone wants to look. but I'd be happy with suggestions for backround reading, or tools I can use to spot the leak
[05:13:19] <Nasp> mota: how much data does your targets  object contain
[05:14:34] <manrig> Hi guys trying to change the element ouput on jquery parallax div, how is the height element being generated and how can I add px ?
[05:14:46] <mota> it's an array of six strings, the longest is 7 chars
[05:14:55] <mota> Nasp^
[05:15:10] <manrig> http://pastebin.com/LXyufc4r
[05:16:33] <Nasp> I could just only see you stuffing  stuff into it
[05:16:50] <Nasp> But check if you have arrays where  you save data
[05:17:34] <mota> I can actually get rid of that array now, and just use config.targets
[05:19:48] <Nasp> Well use a profiler and see what uses the memory
[05:33:18] <manrig> I found http://pastebin.com/LTjvE9bQ
[05:36:25] <mota> Nasp: any recommended profiler?
[05:39:22] <Nasp> Chrome
[05:39:24] <manrig> Figured it out
[05:49:09] <mota> nasp, thanks
[05:49:48] <Nasp> Just run your stuff for a while with the profiler and see what takes up memory
[05:50:37] <mota> I found https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/heap-profiling which showed me there's a way to get comparisons between heap snapshots. might help to figure it out (though a lot of this stuff seems to be internal to jquery)
[05:52:26] <Nasp> Well rub it for a while so you have was better sample
[05:52:39] <Nasp> Maybe decrease your update timer so it goes fastsr
[05:53:10] <mota> ah, good idea on the timer
[06:16:41] <mota> nasp, hmm. this confuses me: http://i.imgur.com/RKhBwuS.png
[06:18:04] <mota> javascript memory around 47.5M per chrome's task manager. but memory at 195.4M and rising. meanwhile the chrome profile reports 16.4M
[06:18:21] <mota> so I guess I don't understand what I am looking at.
[06:21:47] <gavit> what does "$()" mean?
[06:22:16] <mota> jquery selector
[06:22:22] <robhol> it can mean a lot
[06:22:37] <robhol> $(someElement) wraps it in a jquery object
[06:23:01] <gavit> <div id="click_me" onclick="$().toastmessage('showNoticeToast', 'some message here');">Click me</div> this seems to work
[06:23:02] <robhol> $("css-ish expression") finds matching elements and wraps THOSE in a jquery object :p
[06:23:20] <gavit> however whan I do the onclick in my external js it seems to not work :(
[06:23:29] <robhol> just $() seems weird.
[06:23:57] <robhol> I think the common expression is $.function, but I haven't used those a lot
[06:24:05] <mota> the word 'weird' is weird, too. that's language for ya. weird until you get used to it.
[06:25:24] <gavit> its an example here: https://github.com/akquinet/jquery-toastmessage-plugin/wiki
[06:45:19] <gavit> I figured it out, I think I'm binding before the elements exist :(
[08:42:35] <OnceMe> how can I drag and drop simple text element on container/div without UI lib, simply?
[10:32:42] <Enerel> angular vs jquery which is better?
[10:36:05] <daslicht> why do I get teh offset of 0 here : http://jsbin.com/nozike/edit?css,js,output
[10:36:07] <daslicht> ?
[10:36:09] <daslicht> with top its working properly
[10:36:13] <daslicht> but left is always 0 ?
[10:43:53] <daslicht> gosh freaking jsbin
[10:50:00] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/9Lk5bwsz/1/ now the offset it anytime 0
[10:50:24] <Enerel> jeveryone says angular is better than jQuery
[10:50:42] <daslicht> i dont like angulat that much
[10:50:55] <daslicht> angular is somethijng differnt that jquery
[10:50:57] <taplar> they serve different purposes
[10:51:02] <daslicht> exactly
[10:51:07] <Enerel> you have to learn
[10:51:43] <Enerel> better not different purpose
[10:51:46] <taplar> angular is intended to be an mvc framework for javascript.  jquery is just a library for manipulating the dom
[10:52:24] <daslicht> not better :)
[10:52:32] <taplar> apples and oranges
[10:52:38] <daslicht> exactly
[10:52:49] <taplar> angular also includes a smaller version of jquery in it by default called jqlite
[10:52:52] <Enerel> why all mobile apps are uses angular
[10:52:55] <daslicht> angular can be pita to integrate with existing jquery plugins
[10:53:10] <daslicht> Enerel: what is you intention ? trolling ?
[10:53:22] <daslicht> coffee time for me now
[10:53:29] <Enerel> i want to create mobile app
[10:53:55] <daslicht> do it
[10:54:10] <Enerel> angular or jquery?
[10:54:31] <taplar> evaluate the two and see which works better for you
[10:54:44] <Enerel> i have no idea with angular
[10:54:52] <taplar> so go explore
[10:54:53] <Enerel> okay thanks
[11:43:20] <daslicht> re
[11:43:31] <daslicht> yeah research is the best way :)
[11:43:42] <daslicht> just play around with both
[11:43:46] <daslicht> and see how far you get
[12:04:13] <jak2000> how to check if a value is written before? (except the space) if not, i try http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/yfkcy4xb/
[12:05:52] <daslicht> compare text ?
[12:05:56] <daslicht> or what do you mean?
[12:06:37] <jak2000> if a  user type in text1: 50 and in text4: 50 (here is a invalid capture) understand?
[12:07:04] <daslicht> so if both contain 50 trown an error?
[12:07:40] <jak2000> yes
[12:07:47] <jak2000> only 1 value of 50 would be exist
[12:08:14] <jak2000> line 18 check if error
[12:09:56] <daslicht> let me hack somethig
[12:14:27] <daslicht> the comment functiuon is broken is js fiddle
[12:14:28] <daslicht> grr
[12:14:32] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/xser7y62/
[12:14:34] <jak2000> done
[12:14:56] <daslicht> good job
[12:14:57] <daslicht> :)
[12:15:16] <jak2000> test please :)
[12:17:34] <daslicht> seams to work
[12:17:51] <jak2000> not know if is te better way
[12:17:56] <jak2000> but do the job,
[12:18:07] <jak2000> not like me add a extra space when exist error (see ?)
[12:21:33] <jak2000> daslicht, your server side rogramming language is?
[12:21:52] <daslicht> php at the moment
[12:22:01] <daslicht> :D
[12:53:54] <Styles2304> I have a div with a z-index of 1000000 that follows the mouse. However, it can not be viewed over a dialog. Does anyone have an idea that can explain this behavior?
[12:54:04] <Styles2304> The dialog, according to chrome console, has a z-index of 100
[13:15:11] <daslicht> *pling* LevelUp, just created my first jQuery Plugin :)
[13:49:35] <daslicht> .width() os evil !
[14:04:11] <securityintern> Does anyone know why eval() is used in this piece of code? if ( !eval(jQuery("#myElement").val() ){
[14:05:34] <robhol> whatever reason doesn't seem to be a good one :v
[14:07:25] <BatBlaster> Anything I should know before starting to edit a project started using jquery
[14:09:06] <fortification> err whatsorta projet?
[14:10:23] <BatBlaster> something a teacher gave us
[14:10:39] <fortification> yeah because that's the exact sorta detail I asked for
[14:10:47] <fortification> I can't answer your question because you have given me no detail.
[14:16:16] <BatBlaster> its a program that draws shapes bouncing  around a canvas
[14:16:56] <fortification> huh ok so not server side stuff, all JS
[14:19:31] <BatBlaster> maaybe instead of stopping to ask for advice i should just try things and see if they work
[15:13:43] <Kirito_> Is $.browser some deprecated thing in jQuery, or did it ever exist..? I see other programmers using it, but $.browser just returns null for me
[15:14:28] <clockwerk> hello everyone
[15:14:36] <Kirito_> "This property was removed in jQuery 1.9" ah, right.
[15:16:00] <clockwerk> Guys, i have this script, when i try to post form it always says error. Why could it happen? What does this javascript do? http://pastebin.com/VCLwrQsz
[15:17:23] <PlanC> I'm trying to load a normal (SYNC) JS script from an ASYNC JS script
[15:17:38] <PlanC> so I have "page.html" which includes "async.js"
[15:17:59] <PlanC> "async.js" adds "<script src='sync.js'></script>"
[15:18:10] <BatBlaster> wait i think most of what the homweork has can be done in normal js anyway
[15:18:18] <PlanC> to <div id="platform"></div>
[15:18:40] <PlanC> now sync.js should add "test" with a document.write, but it doesn't
[15:19:11] <PlanC> I can't understand why since the async.js does add the script SYNC to the div
[15:19:29] <clockwerk> Anyone?
[15:20:17] <PlanC> clockwerk: what do you need help with?
[15:21:09] <clockwerk> with website js
[15:21:23] <clockwerk> i have this script, when i try to post form it always says error. Why could it happen? What does this javascript do? http://pastebin.com/VCLwrQsz
[15:22:56] <PlanC> http://pastebin.com/K3JGEUCN
[15:22:58] <PlanC> replace it with that
[15:23:05] <PlanC> run it and let me know which number you get in the alert box
[15:27:25] <clockwerk> number 3
[15:28:44] <clockwerk> PlanC: number 3

[19:47:14] <heytheere> anyone?
[19:51:42] <heytheere> did it by doing $('[widget-area="footer"]:first').attr("style","width:inherit!important")

[23:03:05] <zizzl> Hey guys I have an element that has a dynamic top margin depending on the window size.. I want to subtract from that value during a scroll function I have, how can I do that here jQuery(".mainSlideImage").css("margin-top", <current-margin-top> - scrollTop / 10);
[23:03:14] <zizzl> scrollTop has been previously defined
[23:03:34] <VectorX> ok nm got it, its html:
[23:05:56] <VectorX> var current_margin_top = parseFloat(jQuery(".mainSlideImage").css("margin-top");
[23:06:12] <VectorX> var current_margin_top = parseFloat(jQuery(".mainSlideImage").css("margin-top"));
[23:06:54] <VectorX> zizzl you can get the current value with that
[23:11:55] <zizzl> VectorX how?
[23:13:47] <VectorX> zizzl is the line of code i pasted too complicated to understand or is there something else happening in your code you didnt mention which makes it not work
[23:13:49] <VectorX> ?
[23:15:26] <zizzl> VectorX forget the line of code.. Basically I want to be able to just add a value to the current value
[23:15:43] <zizzl> the margin-top will vary so I can't have that set
[23:20:08] <VectorX> zizzl sorry i am not seeing the problem with the information you have provided, perhaps if you have a fiddle or link to a working example
