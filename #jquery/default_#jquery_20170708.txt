[01:10:17] <Al_nz1> what am I doing wrong here : https://jsfiddle.net/8bzdag7t/5/ ? I only want the label to appear if its not already there
[01:10:47] <Al_nz1> the fiddle isnt working properly as the label doesnt appear duplicate times anyway but it does on my local system.
[03:55:48] <latemus> is it legal to have .ajax({success: function(data) { return data; },}); return the data in this way, for use later?
[04:16:01] <latemus> what am i doing wrong with $.map, my variables are not being set. termbin.com/ev0r
[04:50:08] <Filarius22> hello, I cant do waiting for ajax result to use async as syncronius (without setting ajax to be syncronius), https://jsfiddle.net/zhncfw0p/2/
[05:02:46] <cannap> @Filarius22, https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/zhncfw0p/3/
[05:03:05] <cannap> with .done https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/zhncfw0p/4/
[05:07:33] <cannap> return promise everytime because ajax is async return value will hit before the ajax request is done
[05:07:35] <cannap> because async
[05:18:45] <Filarius22> cannap, but what  about function what will return value and will wait for async response ?
[05:19:05] <cannap> callback?
[05:19:59] <cannap> you can not just return the value you need a callback in the .done in the function qwer itself
[05:20:27] <cannap> or this return the promise
[05:21:00] <Filarius22> but... i want to wait for value... do not say i need set times and wait for same variable to became not undef
[05:21:09] <Filarius22> *timer
[05:23:26] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/zhncfw0p/5/
[05:23:36] <cannap> i dont know what you want
[05:23:41] <cannap> you cant just wait for value
[05:23:57] <cannap> alert(qwer) will be executed
[05:24:04] <cannap> before the ajax request is done
[05:25:50] <cannap> es await async  https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/zhncfw0p/6/ but you cant still not return the value
[05:25:57] <cannap> you need a callback or just return the promise
[05:26:04] <cannap> es6
[05:26:06] <cannap> 7
[05:26:10] <cannap> no idea in which version this was
[05:28:18] <Filarius22> well, this function still async...
[05:28:20] <Filarius22> https://jsfiddle.net/zhncfw0p/7/
[05:29:05] <cannap> yes
[05:29:18] <cannap> what do you think just the code style has changed
[05:29:26] <Filarius22> I know, its not good to do sync downloads, but I want to find how to do sync way with having async
[05:29:48] <cannap> what
[05:29:51] <cannap> sync with having async?
[05:29:53] <cannap> o_O
[05:31:04] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/zhncfw0p/8/$
[05:31:06] <cannap> https://jsfiddle.net/cannap/zhncfw0p/8/
[05:31:16] <cannap> check line 8
[05:31:16] <cannap> 9
[05:31:22] <cannap> but its no more async^^
[05:31:55] <Filarius22> check line 6  :)
[05:32:47] <cannap> oh
[05:33:01] <cannap> you cant have both...
[05:33:03] <cannap> how should this work
[05:33:12] <cannap> maybe you dont understand how this promise stuff works
[05:33:19] <cannap> or i dont understand 100% what you want
[05:33:23] <cannap> i give up
[05:33:54] <Filarius22> will, idea is to async... and wait until it return response, then retuen response as function value
[05:34:58] <cannap> ask in #javascript
[05:35:12] <cannap> this is also a js question maybe ask what you want and someone can give you a tip
[05:35:14] <cannap> and you can use it
[05:35:27] <cannap> this is sync
[05:35:35] <cannap> when you do this with promise
[05:35:40] <cannap> it exactly what you want
[05:35:44] <cannap> .then / .done waits
[05:35:50] <cannap> until the promise is resolvedd
[05:35:55] <cannap> or reject
[05:36:40] <Filarius22> i tryed .then .done , but they do not make code wait for response, they just do callbacks, but still async
[05:37:44] <cannap> there is no way
[05:37:49] <cannap> this is not possible
[05:37:52] <Filarius22> nooooo ! ^)
[05:37:52] <cannap> or i missed something
[05:38:13] <cannap> for what they make 2 thing sync/async
[05:38:19] <cannap> this is not just call for fun async or sync
[05:38:42] <cannap> sync means code waits async dont wait give promise/callback for this one little thing a small callback would be fine
[05:38:50] <cannap> but when you have much asyn operations then go with promise
[05:38:56] <cannap> no one wants callback hell
[05:59:14] <latemus> does js switch statement allow strings/
[05:59:19] <latemus> or just integers
[06:01:31] <cannap> strings also
[06:01:37] <latemus> thansk cannap
[06:01:47] <cannap> you mean case "bla"
[06:01:53] <latemus> mhm
[06:02:04] <cannap> what
[06:02:15] <latemus> yes that is what i meant
[06:02:18] <cannap> then yes

[10:08:14] <Boatman> I have a ajax request .one('click'), is it possible to have it reversed as well?
[10:08:30] <Boatman> "If isn't the first click" kind of
[10:11:21] <pavonia> You could nstall a new click handler on the first click
[10:28:39] <codecutter> no hasId?
[10:33:53] <gandul> Hello, why is this returning "true" when it should be false? https://jsfiddle.net/hg1rr3rp/3/
[10:36:05] <gandul> removed unnecessary code https://jsfiddle.net/hg1rr3rp/4/
[10:40:03] <gandul> nvm
[10:40:20] <gandul> forget I asked even
[10:43:12] <gandul> is this channel full of bots?
[10:53:35] <gandul> i think so
[10:53:56] <Woet> bye
[10:58:23] <hollusion> $('select option').map(function () { return $(this).text(); });
[10:58:31] <hollusion> is there a way to make this return an array ?
[10:59:12] <hollusion> no wait it does but .indexOf() does not work with arrays?
[11:00:02] <hollusion> .map() seems to return an object instead of plain array
[11:01:42] <hollusion> "As the return value is a jQuery object, which contains an array, it's very common to call .get()"
[11:01:45] <hollusion> ... i see
[11:27:35] <Cork> hollusion: alternatively use $.map, that is meant to be used to produce arrays
[11:28:03] <Cork> $.map($('select option'), function(elm) { return $(elm).text() })
[11:32:05] <codecutter> is there a quick way to check if any of the input fields in form are empty?
[11:32:12] <codecutter> i.e. validation
[11:38:34] <hollusion> thank you Cork
[12:19:43] <obinoob> is it possible to track a html normal form submit request and do something while waiting?
[12:22:14] <obinoob> is it possible or not?
[12:25:47] <hollusion> define "do something"
[12:27:18] <hollusion> define "track"
[16:50:51] <efffe> <a><b>lipsum</b></a>  <a><b>lipsum</b></a>    How can I click on <b> and set a class on the closest <a> specific to that <b>?
[16:51:19] <Woet> efffe: what did you try so far?
[16:51:26] <efffe> I know it has something to do with binding, but it's really cancer that you can't just $(this).closest('[a]').toggleClass('derp')
[16:52:01] <Woet> efffe: besides using swear words because you don't understand jQuery.
[16:52:15] <efffe> I tried e.preventDefault; $(this).closest('[a]').toggleClass('this-should-work')
[16:52:33] <Woet> efffe: but you want it to happen when you click on it.
[16:52:38] <Woet> efffe: is that in onclick=""?
[16:52:50] <efffe> $('[b]').click(e =>
[16:53:05] <Woet> efffe: show your jsfiddle
[16:53:20] <Woet> efffe: also, did you check the docs on .closest?
[16:54:05] <efffe> No. I literally just need reminded how to do this binding stuff and it'll click.
[16:54:12] <efffe> I used to know at one point.
[16:55:03] <Woet> efffe: time to read the docs then
[16:55:34] <efffe> https://jsfiddle.net/xfmnugxg/
[16:57:17] <efffe> read walls of text on dying framework smug-anime-girl.jpegarino
[16:58:24] <efffe> https://jsfiddle.net/xfmnugxg/2/ got it
[16:58:25] <efffe> ffs
[16:58:30] <efffe> irc gurus...
[16:58:53] <Woet> lol
