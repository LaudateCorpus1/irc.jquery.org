[02:32:20] <intellilogic> How in JSON whould I make somehting like    Fruits: Apple, Plum, Orange
[02:32:33] <intellilogic> I only see key value pairs 1 to 1 in all the examples
[02:33:49] <quicksilver> "fruits": ["Apple","Plum","Orange"] // but this is quite offtopic here
[02:34:04] <intellilogic> Nah, use JSON stuff in jquery..
[02:34:25] <demodemo> GuidoBouman, 'run' dnt work
[02:35:51] <GuidoBouman> demodemo, You'll have to be more descriptive. And if run doesn't work, there's something wrong in the code. Share that jsFiddle document with us.
[02:36:41] <quicksilver> intellilogic: I use maths in jquery; that doesn't make it ontopic here. This channel is for jquery questiosn :P
[02:36:50] <raygerrard> i have written a validation method for jquery validator, i would only like it to validate if the user has stopped entering input for X amount of time, not on every keyup event, anyone know how if this can be achieved?
[02:37:07] <superos> Maybe not strictly jQuery, but how can I transfer the search string entered to a search field on one page to a search field on a dedicated search page and then automatically submit that page?
[02:38:07] <intellilogic> I see, where would be the place to ask about JSON?  JS channel?
[02:38:10] <intellilogic> No JSON channel
[02:38:26] <quicksilver> the javascript channel, I imagine.
[02:38:30] <demodemo> GuidoBouman, if 'run' is hit without saving, nothing was displayed in result. works fine after 'save'
[02:41:31] <GuidoBouman> demodemo, SO, do you still have an issue with your code? if not, try copying that exact code to your live project. Should solve your problem. If not, post the url to your live code here.
[02:42:05] <clir-in> hi! how can i get the value of day, month, year from datepicker seperately?

[02:53:51] <azorai> anli_, check stackoverflow. Seriously, bunch of cross-browser implementations there.
[02:54:01] <anli_> I did
[02:54:08] <anli_> However, I had to use a plugin for this
[02:54:42] <anli_> incredible, but true

[03:14:49] <Guest95566> $().stop()
[03:15:08] <nir01> looks ugly
[03:15:14] <Guest95566> no that's not it
[03:15:19] <Guest95566> $().stop().hammertime()
[03:16:15] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/MmL8hNaZ  i got 2 lists and if you drag somethign from one list to the other it should delete a placeholder, but just if it was added to thsi second list. atm, logically i'm deleting the palceholder always when drop: is triggeret. How can i achieve that? how do i check if it was added to a specific element?
[03:39:22] <Asher_> hi - what would be the best way to append an html table cell to an existing row in jquery?
[03:40:22] <azorai> $('tr#existing-thing').append( '<td>Blah</td>' );
[03:43:26] <Asher_> not sure how I would do that in this case: http://codepad.org/nS3uOzyP
[03:44:25] <aaronmcadam> if u add an extra td it wouldn't quite work
[03:44:37] <aaronmcadam> unless the rest of ur table has an extra column
[03:44:50] <Asher_> the table is a normal table with just <tr> and <td> elements, no <tbody> or anything
[03:44:59] <aaronmcadam> think about it, u can't have one row with 4 tds and another row with 5 tds
[03:45:14] <aaronmcadam> r will add the tbody
[03:45:18] <aaronmcadam> firefox will
[03:45:25] <Asher_> no, it fills a specified number of cells
[03:45:39] <Asher_> in this case, doesn't go beyond 7 per row
[03:45:49] <aaronmcadam> ok
[03:46:10] <aaronmcadam> make a jsfiddle of it
[03:46:11] <Asher_> more info here: http://codepad.org/O7H0yRCh
[03:46:27] <aaronmcadam> fiddleeee
[03:46:58] <aaronmcadam> don't use document.write either
[03:47:13] <Asher_> that contains the fiddles, but http://jsfiddle.net/FkXtU/ and http://jsfiddle.net/9uxCJ/
[03:47:29] <Asher_> you can see the td elements aren't lining up properly in the second example
[03:47:55] <Xotix> if you have something like this http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable how can i say "do xxx when "Drag me down" was added t o the specific element X! otherwise, don't."
[03:48:05] <aaronmcadam> Asher_: you don't need to reimplement indexOf, $.inArray does the very same and falls back to native if available
[03:48:45] <Asher_> oh I see
[03:49:22] <aaronmcadam> you could do with looking at this article http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/terse-javascript-101-part-1/
[03:49:45] <aaronmcadam> there's no need to use Array objects, use literals where ever u can
[03:50:10] <aaronmcadam> damn, you're using doc.write everywhere
[03:50:21] <aaronmcadam> and defining vars inside if statements
[03:50:36] <Asher_> I'm new to javascript :)
[03:50:45] <aaronmcadam> it definately shows :)
[03:51:03] <Asher_> hopefully it will get better as time goes by
[03:51:05] <aaronmcadam> what language do u know
[03:51:09] <aaronmcadam> Java?
[03:51:16] <Asher_> no, php
[03:51:21] <Asher_> just a little bit
[03:51:22] <aaronmcadam> k
[03:51:31] <aaronmcadam> question is
[03:51:38] <aaronmcadam> why are you implementing a calendar yourself?
[03:51:57] <aaronmcadam> jquery ui datepicker is good
[03:52:00] <Asher_> mainly because I can customize it using css, and I know what to change
[03:52:03] <aaronmcadam> or else yui's one is very good
[03:52:14] <aaronmcadam> firebug will help u customise
[03:52:40] <Asher_> sure
[03:52:44] <aaronmcadam> you're using very little of jQuery's actual API
[03:52:59] <aaronmcadam> hence your code is overly verbose and inefficient
[03:53:04] <Asher_> I only made the conversion to jquery recently, due to a problem with closures
[03:53:09] <Xotix> no one? :(
[03:53:27] <aaronmcadam> Asher_: I bet you're having scoping issues cuz of how ur defining your variables
[03:54:00] <Asher_> well, maybe if we can focus on the issue at hand, and not worry about how bad the code is :)
[03:54:11] <aaronmcadam> that's probably the issue
[03:54:16] <aaronmcadam> bad code is hard to debug
[03:54:19] <Asher_> could you tell me how I can enter <td>'s?
[03:54:39] <Asher_> I don't need to worry about the rest of the code - just that part
[03:54:47] <aaronmcadam> the way you're defining events is wrong too
[03:55:11] <Asher_> now I remember why I don't use freenode... you ask a question, and get a sermon
[03:55:23] <aaronmcadam> if that's ur attitude then find someone else
[03:55:32] <aaronmcadam> we're here to try to help u learn, not write your code for u
[03:55:43] <Asher_> and if you resist, people will attack you
[03:55:56] <Asher_> anyone else?
[03:56:24] <aaronmcadam> Xotix: what was ur prob?
[03:56:34] <quicksilver> undoubtedly someone will help you in a minute. Your attitude sounds like you will be most rewarding to work with, Asher_.
[03:56:43] <Xotix> Asher_ why not using datepicker? Its very nice.
[03:57:04] <Asher_> quicksilver: is that sarcasm? it's hard to detect, but definitely very familiar
[03:57:29] <aaronmcadam> Xotix: can you check the docs to see if a reference to the dragged element is passed?
[03:57:45] <aaronmcadam> Xotix: I'm only guessing, but surely in the callback it passes something?
[03:59:21] <blackspotwiggins> quicksilver, next time use this Ø
[03:59:26] <aaronmcadam> wow
[03:59:33] <aaronmcadam> ØØØ
[03:59:38] <aaronmcadam> Ø?
[03:59:44] <aaronmcadam> hmm weird
[03:59:53] <blackspotwiggins> it's the irony punctuation
[04:00:33] <Asher_> idiots 1, asher 0, another fine day in the annals of freenode. bye!
[04:00:39] <aaronmcadam> hahaa
[04:00:50] <aaronmcadam> i'd hate to work with that guy :D
[04:01:04] <blackspotwiggins> it's funny that you actually told him the exact answer
[04:01:14] <blackspotwiggins> but seems like he could not handle the critique
[04:01:19] <aaronmcadam> nopes
[04:01:30] <aaronmcadam> which answer was the right one? haha :D
[04:01:51] <blackspotwiggins> ah, it was not you
[04:02:02] <aaronmcadam> what was it?
[04:02:06] <blackspotwiggins> <azorai> $('tr#existing-thing').append( '<td>Blah</td>' );
[04:02:15] <aaronmcadam> ah haha
[04:02:23] <Xotix> aaronmcadam: yeah there is stop. So i checked the event object but couldn't find nay drio target or something jsut a target which seems to be the drag target. But im checking again :)
[04:02:25] <aaronmcadam> his code was awful tho
[04:02:42] <aaronmcadam> hmm

[04:42:49] <yiti007> There are no section for webpage
[04:44:20] <emilkarl> Having problems with animate and iOS. I feels laggy, the animation it not so smooth. Any ideas?
[04:44:22] <azorai> Maybe post in the 'Developing jQuery Plugins'  section..
[04:45:12] <emilkarl> I have 4 Divs. in a container. Container with 400%, every div inside has 25%. Then with jQuery I take the first one in the container and animates to 0 width and puts it last.
[04:45:27] <emilkarl> but the animation from 25% lags
[04:45:51] <yiti007> Azorai, thx you. I'm going to try posting in 'About the jQuery Forum' section
[04:46:25] <clir-in> hi. how can i do this. a button that when clicked the date value from datepicker should increase one day. ?
[04:47:37] <azorai> emilkarl, 1) try using -webkit-animation CSS instead of jQuery animations ... 2) Try enabling hardware acceleration in webkit using -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); in the CSS on the container element. Research 'slow animation webkit ios'

[05:59:18] <blackspotwiggins> _science, it gets parsed incorrectly

[06:01:13] <_science> blackspotwiggins: cheers you atleast confirmed my suspision :)
[06:01:37] <blackspotwiggins> _science, i had some similar issues too, setting the names manually worked
[06:02:54] <Kn|t3> No one uses closure?
[06:03:49] <NodeX> try #closure
[06:05:37] <znow> I have a page with a list of posts, each post has a comment link which "slideToggle" a comment class, but if I press the link of the first post, all the other post's "add comment" box gets expanded aswell
[06:06:21] <znow> ?
[06:06:30] <JackBauer24> znow: that's because you select all the elements with "comments" class
[06:06:50] <znow> JackBauer24: yeah hehe, okay so how can I limit to the one I am clicking that needs to be slided?
[06:06:53] <JackBauer24> you need to refer to the child of your comment or set different IDs, your choice
[06:07:04] <_science> blackspotwiggins: didnt work though ;( i think my "fail-solution" to this is to use JSON2 and do JSON.stringify(data) and then send that.

[06:07:36] <JackBauer24> znow: read about parent and child selectors
[06:07:48] <znow> NodeX: erhhh wth?
[06:08:18] <znow> JackBauer24: I need parent and child selectors... where should I put a parent/child selector, in my $(".add_comment").slideToggle(); or in my $(".add_comment_link").click(function() { ?

[06:08:45] <znow> NodeX: ive seen your message dude
[06:08:50] <znow> :)
[06:08:56] <NodeX> so why are you saking "wth"v ?
[06:09:04] <NodeX> asking*
[06:09:12] <blackspotwiggins> _science, it should work, check if you are sending correct data with firebug
[06:09:39] <znow> NodeX: cause I dont know how to use that plumb shit
[06:10:13] <NodeX> then how do you expect anyone to help you if they can't see your code / markup
[06:10:53] <znow> NodeX: JackBauer24 actually helped me some way.. its quite simple code
[06:11:04] <NodeX> some way being the operative words
[06:14:16] <znow> NodeX: https://gist.github.com/1308997
[06:18:09] <znow> NodeX: ?
[06:19:56] <NodeX> err is that even javascfript
[06:20:11] <NodeX> oh yer ... .. I need the HTML markup not whatever that crap above it is
[06:20:25] <NodeX> ruby is it ?
[06:21:47] <blackspotwiggins> znow, just use $(this).parent()
[06:22:00] <znow> blackspotwiggins: hmm where?
[06:22:18] <blackspotwiggins> on the element you want to toggle, presumably
[06:22:26] <znow> ah
[06:22:41] <blackspotwiggins> $(this).closest(".add_comment") is slightly more change-resistant
[06:22:57] <znow> ahhhh in that way, okay
[06:24:03] <Xotix> how can i do that but expect :last? $("#editor tr>td:nth-child(2)")
[06:25:01] <NodeX> ?demo @ Xotix

[06:25:47] <Morkel> Can anyone tell me why i can not access the variable search_data in firebug? https://gist.github.com/1309017
[06:26:55] <znow> blackspotwiggins: $(this).parent(".add_comment").slideToggle(); doenst seem to work, neither with .closest
[06:27:11] <Xotix> Its a simple question, not related to any code issue. Just a selector question. But okay ..
[06:28:23] <NodeX> Morkel : reserved char
[06:28:27] <blackspotwiggins> znow, ah, other way around
[06:28:44] <blackspotwiggins> .children() or .find()
[06:28:50] <Morkel> NodeX: what do you mean?
[06:28:51] <blackspotwiggins> or jut fix your markup to not wrap stuff
[06:28:59] <Kaseano> I was wondering how to get function 2 to fire before function1 in this situation http://pastie.org/2750459
[06:28:59] <NodeX> @ is a reserved char
[06:29:07] <znow> blackspotwiggins: $(".add_comment").(this).parent.slideToggle();
[06:29:33] <ajpiano> Morkel: it's probably because the scope of the handler is changing in the ajax callback
[06:29:42] <ajpiano> Morkel: see ?ajaxcallbackscope

[06:29:49] <ajpiano> NodeX: it's cofeescript
[06:29:51] <blackspotwiggins> znow, dude please make an effort to understand wtf you are doing
[06:29:55] <NodeX> wtf lol
[06:29:58] <Xotix> how can i approache that in 1 selector: http://pastebin.com/26vps4d6 its a normal 2 column table.
[06:30:08] <NodeX> I wondered why it looked like bad jQUery lol
[06:30:10] <znow> blackspotwiggins: well Js never been my preferable choice
[06:30:12] <Robbington> Hey, using Jquerys template tag, how can I see if an element has a style of display:block and make sure it stays that way?
[06:30:25] <blackspotwiggins> znow, time to learn then
[06:30:36] <blackspotwiggins> just randomly trying stuff wont get you far
[06:30:41] <znow> blackspotwiggins: probably, aint using it that much, only for very small snippets
[06:35:46] <Aamir> Xotix:  something like http://pastebin.com/kriegJSw
[06:36:40] <Xotix> thanks im gonna try it out
[06:39:53] <red> I'm trying to use jPlayer but getting this error: #<Object> has no method 'test'
[06:42:03] <JAAulde> any recommendations on a jQ infinite scrolling plugin, or a more generic scrolling lib which tracks whether something has scrolled into view?
[06:42:33] <codecowboy> How do I prevent my ul from animating while the select box it contains is being used? E.g. Its impossible to select anything from the select boxes here - http://jsfiddle.net/mDUa9/1/
[06:43:39] <blackspotwiggins> JAAulde, use window.pageYHeight and compare it to the elements offset()
[06:43:44] <blackspotwiggins> not everything has to be a plugin
[06:43:50] <Xotix> is there a function like get nth-child? so i get the info which child it is.
[06:44:22] <blackspotwiggins> ?index @ Xotix
[06:44:23] <JAAulde> blackspotwiggins: well, I understand nt everything has to be a plugin. however I was sort of hoping for something which was already set up to monitor and fire events
[06:44:23] <bot-t> Xotix, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[06:44:49] <JAAulde> blackspotwiggins: that said, I can write it myself no problem, was just hoping to save a few min
[06:44:57] <Xotix> thanks!
[06:52:59] <Myx0x3> Hi! This stupid event.layerX/layerY makeing my jQuery toggle to fail.. how do i come around this?

[06:53:45] <bot-t> Myx0x3, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:57:24] <Myx0x3> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/UWJEB/1/ but at my site, it does not work :S and i get no other warnings or errors in my console
[06:59:22] <Myx0x3> "event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future."
[06:59:41] <Myx0x3> Its been fixed in 1.7..
[07:01:10] <RaceCondition> there's this very common pattern I run into all the time:
[07:01:31] <RaceCondition> I have a boolean/condition based on which I either add or remove a specific class from an element/set of elements
[07:01:52] <RaceCondition> now, with addClass/removeClass, I always have to write an if-else block for either case
[07:02:16] <RaceCondition> however, does jQuery have a setClass(clsName, trueOrNot) method to shorten it?
[07:03:28] <kborchers> RaceCondition: depending on your situation maybe see ?toggleClass
[07:03:29] <bot-t> RaceCondition, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[07:03:30] <RaceCondition> ahaa, toggleClass takes an extra argumentâshould have RTFM first
[07:03:37] <RaceCondition> kborchers: yeah :)
[07:04:33] <XMan2012> I am having problem on my slider... Actually, i want to make something that if there is no thumb image or incorrect then do not load that thumbnail
[07:04:42] <XMan2012> I am using http://coffeescripter.com/code/ad-gallery/ plugin
[07:05:58] <XMan2012> whenever i do not giv e thumbnail image... then it loads an empty thumbnail box
[07:06:08] <XMan2012> i want to make it if there is no thumbnail
[07:06:21] <XMan2012> then do not load thumbail box
[07:10:28] <RaceCondition> kborchers: however, what does toggleClass without params, or just with the switch param do?
[07:10:43] <RaceCondition> take whatever sole class exists on the element and toggle that, remembering if necessary?
[07:10:57] <RaceCondition> I mean, $('#foo').toggleClass([switch])
[07:11:04] <RaceCondition> it's not documented
[07:11:46] <kborchers> RaceCondition: "As of jQuery 1.4, if no arguments are passed toÂ .toggleClass(), all class names on the element the first timeÂ .toggleClass()Â is called will be toggled. Also as of jQuery 1.4, the class name to be toggled can be determined by passing in a function."
[07:12:19] <RaceCondition> kborchers: aha, okay, and if I toggle the second time, it will remember which classes were previously toggled
[07:12:35] <TheoMurpse> Why would this jquery cause the current page to reload rther than populating the jquery ui modal window with the retrieved HTML? jsfiddle.net/uQXV6
[07:12:40] <Xotix> may someone help me on that :) http://forum.jquery.com/topic/drop-target-from-dragable
[07:12:44] <kborchers> RaceCondition: honestly, never used it without the class param ... see ?tias
[07:12:45] <bot-t> RaceCondition, Try It And See
[07:12:55] <RaceCondition> yeah, good point
[07:13:11] <TheoMurpse> FWIW, the retrieved data is a full webpage from <html> to </html>
[07:13:31] <botfather> who made bot-t ? is it ok for me to copy this ? thing for my own bot ?
[07:13:44] <blackspotwiggins> bot-t, temp01 made it/him
[07:13:44] <botfather> really like the interface of it also the @ is nice

[07:13:51] <ajpiano> botfather: where do you plan on copying it from :)
[07:13:54] <blackspotwiggins> err
[07:14:05] <botfather> well just the usage of it
[07:14:18] <botfather> i'll program it into http://jsonbot.googlecode.com
[07:14:56] <botfather> the ?<item> is easy to parse
[07:14:57] <juha_> i think temp01 has patents on irc-bots
[07:15:13] <botfather> !seen temp01
[07:15:31] <ajpiano> botfather: i'm sure tempsy will not mind your copying the interface
[07:15:41] <ajpiano> i was just saying that the code isn't anywhere so you'd be implementing it all yourself
[07:15:47] <botfather> i really like it
[07:15:57] <botfather> yeah the hide the code of the bot thing is also mysterious

[07:16:14] <jbarket> Question. Is there some kind of standard for change events on widgets? I have a jquery ui widget that replaces <select>s, and I want to trigger a change event for it
[07:16:18] <botfather> i'm going to do this on a sqlite backend

[07:16:32] <orolo1> i'm sending a JSON.stringify("long string in here") to php via $.ajax. when i log out the string prior to sending it, it is valid j
[07:16:43] <juha_> ?change @ jbarket
[07:16:43] <bot-t> jbarket, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:16:50] <orolo1> JSON. but when i look at the headers 'Form Data', the JSON is breaking.
[07:17:16] <botfather> tips
[07:17:17] <jbarket> juha_, right, but like i said, since it isn't a select any more, the select is disabled, so .change doesn't fire
[07:17:29] <botfather> is that a random thing or a markov thing ? lol
[07:17:33] <orolo1> it's tripping up on d#39; etc. foreign language stuff.
[07:17:38] <juha_> jbarket: oh, how about click?
[07:17:44] <jbarket> juha_, you are brilliant
[07:17:51] <juha_> no
[07:18:15] <jbarket> i think that'll do it
[07:18:25] <botfather> are all the plugins MIT ?
[07:18:28] <botfather> quess not
[07:18:31] <botfather> guess
[07:40:41] <andrew9183> hey guys, if  i want to make a function animate the border selected by an ID, how do I refer to the ID in the function ? can I just do var turnOn = function(id) { $(id).animate({opacity: 1}, fast); }; ?
[07:40:50] <andrew9183> id would take values such as #header
[07:41:49] <blackspotwiggins> andrew9183, use this
[07:42:01] <Guest68995> hi i'm having an issue dismissing the dropdown for jquery.tokenInput
[07:42:30] <blackspotwiggins> the handler for event callback (which you are probably using) has a context of the element it's triggered by
[07:43:34] <necromancer> when i click the input box, it creates the dropdown with "No results.". I'd like to add a link in there to add at oken
[07:43:37] <necromancer> a token*
[07:43:59] <andrew9183> hmm, what do you mean in terms of code ?
[07:44:02] <necromancer> right now the plugin has hiding this dropdown onBlur, but i had to remove that because it was being caught before the click action i had to define for the link
[07:45:16] <necromancer> my question is how can i get that link to submit the POST properly while still keeping that onBlur event sorta-intact?
[07:48:25] <necromancer> never mind, just added a setTimeout to the hide function onblur :)

[08:14:46] <truce> hi
[08:15:02] <truce> $(document).load() is not working for me
[08:15:16] <truce> are there any limitations using .load(0
[08:15:21] <truce> .load()
[08:15:32] <ajpiano> $(window).load(fn)
[08:15:38] <johnline3> ^
[08:16:20] <truce> $(document).load(function(){ 	console.log('loaded');	 });
[08:16:25] <truce> not logging anything
[08:16:45] <ajpiano> use window
[08:16:56] <truce> window is going to be too early for me
[08:16:58] <Rushing> is there a way to cancel a deferred object?
[08:17:07] <ajpiano> truce: what are you even talking about
[08:17:08] <truce> its an animation and I need all the images to be loaded
[08:17:08] <snover> there is no load event on document
[08:17:17] <ajpiano> truce: that is when window.load fires
[08:17:27] <ajpiano> Rushing: .reject() ?
[08:17:52] <Rushing> nah :/ doing validation, so i'm using reject for the invalid result
[08:18:00] <truce> in the api documentations i see i can even use $('#wrapper').load()
[08:18:11] <Rushing> but if the validate() method is called while another is executing, i'd like to cancel the previous
[08:18:36] <ajpiano> Rushing: reject is the method of a deffered that ... rejects it
[08:18:53] <ajpiano> truce: .load has multiple signatures
[08:19:08] <ajpiano> you can only use the one that binds to the load event on the window and images and scripts etc, things that have a load event
[08:19:12] <ajpiano> the document does not
[08:19:17] <Rushing> right, so if they try to validate something and it's invalid, i reject
[08:19:21] <ajpiano> just use $(window).load(fn);
[08:19:44] <truce> @ajpiano let me try it on remote server.. may be in localhost its firing very early
[08:21:00] <Rushing> ajpiano, am i using reject() incorrectly? maybe i'm confused by the reject callbacks being called "fails"
[08:21:14] <ajpiano> Rushing: i don't think you are
[08:21:29] <ajpiano> you can reject it with a different argument depending on ... why you're rejecting it
[08:22:42] <gnarf> Rushing: if its a jqXHR, it has .abort
[08:22:49] <Rushing> ok, well i'll just reject the previous validation chain. not sure what the consequences of the fail callbacks will be yet
[08:23:00] <gnarf> Rushing: otherwise, you will need to write your own .abort funciton and add it to the promise
[08:23:00] <Rushing> thx gnarf, it's just a plain $.Deferred though
[08:23:03] <loxs> folks, are you aware of some plugin that is able to constantly update a list (regardless of form) of similar objects from the server. Or at least I need some guidelines/good practices on the topic.
[08:24:26] <truce> loxs you may use node.js if you need to keep fetching data from the server
[08:24:37] <truce> or use long polling using recursive ajax
[08:24:40] <davemo> loxs: socket.io for a polling abstraction + backbone
[08:25:21] <loxs> truce, davemo, I have something MUCH better - erlang. What I need is something on the client side. And a clean way to do that stuff
[08:25:27] <davemo> setup a view backed by a collection, with the collections 'reset' and 'add' events bound to your rendering functions
[08:25:40] <blackspotwiggins> loxs, websockets are pretty nice
[08:25:50] <davemo> use socket.io to get a 'socket' like connection to erlang, then create the view + collection in backbone.js
[08:25:55] <loxs> davemo, could you show me a link to those collections?
[08:26:02] <davemo> ?backbone @loxs

[08:33:38] <kaisukaru> Can anyone recommend good (Ajax) JQuery plugin to change data in table using JSON?
[08:33:38] <johnernaut> is it possible to load an entire page with ajax using load?  I used $('html').load('blah.php')  but it doesn't load the body for some reason
[08:34:42] <lucenut> I am using colorbox to open a dialog with a form in it. But when the link to open the dialog is down the page a ways the dialog doesn't open at the top of the window. It's halways off the screen going down.
[08:35:33] <lucenut> How can I force the dialog to the top of the screen?
[08:36:45] <zensei> lucenut: Try position: fixed instead of position: absolute?
[08:47:16] <lucenut> When I put position: "fixed" it appears even further down the page.
[08:48:00] <djino> hi, does the $(window).load event guarantee, that all the images were loaded on a page and I can safely read their height, width, etc?
[08:53:21] <johnernaut> is it possible to load an entire page with ajax using load?  I used $('html').load('blah.php')  but it doesn't load the body for some reason
[08:56:59] <ryanneufeld> johnernaut: why would you do such a thing? That's no different than a normal page load
[08:57:54] <alem0lars> how can I associate a callback to galleriffic when all thumbs are finished to load?
[09:01:53] <TheoMurpse> Say upon some event I'm loading a jquery UI dialog with data pulling at that moment from another URL (same server as the other page). I put that data in an iframe in the dialog with  $(document.createElement('iframe')).attr('src',URL). Once it's loaded (it takes about 5-10 seconds to load because of some heavy Java being done to prep the data, how can I resize the dialog and iframe to be only as big as necessary to contain the dat
[09:01:53] <TheoMurpse> a? (The data is a grid from the jgrid plugin.)
[09:03:05] <botfather> yeah size to fit is the difficult stuff
[09:03:30] <botfather> still dont get how to that properly
[09:03:53] <botfather> ?scrollTop
[09:03:53] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[09:04:12] <botfather> thats the one i need not sure what resize is
[09:04:21] <botfather> ?resize

[09:06:16] <TheoMurpse> Alternatively, how can I pop open a blank dialog and then fill it with AJAX-gotten data? I tried $(foo).dialog(); $.ajax({url: URL, success: function(data) {$(foo).html(data);}}); but that just waits a bit and then reloads the "parent" page.
[09:06:37] <lucenut> I am opening a colorbox dialog like this: $(".addRequestLnk").colorbox({width: "800", height: "600", href:"docs/divs/div_requestAffiliateSpace.cfm...
[09:06:55] <lucenut> But it is opening the dialog relative to the link.
[09:07:09] <lucenut> I need it to be at the top of the screen.
[09:12:40] <bartek> Hi there. What am I doing wrong with my deferred objects here? The function callback for .then() always fires off instantly, even if the requests are still running. Code example: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/497399
[09:14:08] <bartek> If I log the result of `f`, it's the two XHR request functions I would expect in a list
[09:16:20] <Ortix> Heya people!
[09:16:33] <Ortix> I've got a question:
[09:17:12] <Ortix> I want to load a php file with a parameter sent from 1 of 4 radio buttons
[09:17:16] <Ortix> so basically
[09:17:22] <Ortix> user clicks 1 of 4 radio buttons
[09:17:34] <Ortix> which in turn loads a php file containing a dropdown menu
[09:17:52] <Ortix> and based on their selection of the radio button, a value is posted to the php file
[09:18:10] <Ortix> which makes sure to load the right drop down
[09:18:13] <Ortix> how would I go about doing this?
[09:19:49] <context> ortix: you write code that goes 'depending on the value selected, load a specific file'
[09:20:04] <context> and then a form that 'submits form values to specific url when they click the button'
[09:20:23] <context> ortix: oh, and browsers dont know php
[09:20:24] <Ortix> depending on the value selected load ONE file and pass THAT selected value to that file
[09:21:00] <ravenzz> wait, you have 1 to 4 php files?
[09:21:05] <context> the simpler answer would be: submit to ONE file, and have that ONE file load ANOTHER file depending on THAT option selected
[09:21:20] <Ortix> ok i think we're all getting confuzzled
[09:21:28] <Ortix> lemme explain what's going on
[09:21:32] <Ortix> i've got 4 radio buttons
[09:21:33] <context> no. you are trying to make things more complicated than they need to be
[09:21:44] <Ortix> i do?
[09:21:47] <ravenzz> no wait context, maybe you have misunderstood
[09:21:47] <Ortix> my approach is really simple
[09:21:49] <context> "oh they picked option 2, require("file2.php");" .... DONE.
[09:22:03] <Ortix> well it's not that simple
[09:22:06] <ravenzz> Ortix continue, please
[09:22:16] <Ortix> basically i have 4 radio buttons
[09:22:25] <Ortix> each with a value (BD, DVD, TV, Mixed)
[09:22:30] <Ortix> now let's say I select BD
[09:22:42] <Ortix> I want to load a dropdown menu with all the BD listings
[09:22:46] <Ortix> i am doing that
[09:22:50] <ravenzz> uhm
[09:22:54] <Ortix> by calling to MySQL
[09:22:57] <context> ...
[09:23:10] <Ortix> getting all the listings from under BD
[09:23:10] <ravenzz> ok...but it is silly, usually you load everything
[09:23:11] <paul_irish> hopsy wopsy
[09:23:13] <Ortix> and listing them in a dropdown
[09:23:17] <ravenzz> at the begin
[09:23:51] <Ortix> Well I could technically load everything and then just filter out based on the user selection
[09:23:55] <ravenzz> so it will work if your js is broken
[09:23:58] <context> ravenzz: uhh.. depending on the list you dont. im not pushing 10M dvd/bluray releases on one page...
[09:24:27] <ravenzz> oh yep
[09:24:52] <context> ortix: anyways.. i think thats more background than needed, but go on
[09:24:54] <Ortix> Isn't it really simple to load a php file with an argument being passed by using .load()?
[09:24:55] <ravenzz> anyway you are going to do the same thing by loading those data
[09:25:11] <ravenzz> Ortix yes it is
[09:25:17] <Ortix> so basically I want this to happen
[09:25:26] <Ortix> user clicks BD
[09:25:33] <ravenzz> so
[09:25:39] <Ortix> lemme type
[09:25:48] <Ortix> gotta get my ideas straight :P
[09:25:56] <Hopsy> hey paul_irish
[09:25:59] <ravenzz> ?change @ Ortix
[09:26:00] <bot-t> Ortix, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:26:47] <cybersholt> hello every one does some 1 have a sec to help with some jQ / json
[09:26:50] <Ortix> user clicks BD and automatically it's submitted with the value '111' which is then passed to my php script
[09:27:01] <Ortix> ok i will take a look at the change function
[09:27:07] <ravenzz> Your output could be in JSON
[09:27:18] <Ortix> I already looked at it but i will read through it once again
[09:27:21] <Ortix> now it's dinenr time
[09:27:22] <Ortix> ciao!
[09:27:29] <ravenzz> ciao ;)
[09:28:01] <context> ... wow.
[09:28:05] <ravenzz> ?ask @ cybersholt
[09:28:05] <bot-t> cybersholt, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:29:23] <cybersholt> ive got some return data that comes back to a input as a json string and i need to just find and display part  of of
[09:29:38] <cybersholt> ive tried find and its not finding
[09:30:25] <cybersholt> i've also tried :contain
[09:30:25] <ngharo> cybersholt: can you paste your json string? see ?p
[09:30:26] <bot-t> cybersholt, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:31:16] <ravenzz> well I don't know how your output is organized, so you can start with an console.debug() of the output
[09:32:05] <cybersholt> give me just a moment im making the fiddle
[09:32:09] <jose__> I need help with the following:  http://jsfiddle.net/jWdDw/2/
[09:32:38] <jose__> I have nested selectboxes which I generate with the load() method
[09:32:40] <cybersholt> allright here it is http://jsfiddle.net/PGsyF/
[09:34:32] <ngharo> cybersholt: returned json should be interpretted as an object
[09:34:42] <jose__> but  I think the function $("#fincaid").change(); is out of scope...
[09:35:00] <cybersholt> so ill need to loop thru it an extract the value
[09:35:03] <ngharo> so data['upload_path'], or data.width would both work with that json string you have there
[09:35:51] <ngharo> you can loop over an object with for, see ?mdn for
[09:35:52] <bot-t> ngharo, .outerHeight() - Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[09:36:01] <ngharo> >_>
[09:36:29] <ngharo> cybersholt: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in
[09:36:43] <cybersholt> thanks ngharo
[09:37:38] <jose__> This is the "correct" code:   http://jsfiddle.net/jWdDw/3/
[09:38:05] <cybersholt> later guys
[09:38:19] <ngharo> jose__: that looks ok
[09:38:35] <jose__> but the $("#fincaid").change(); function is never triggered
[09:38:54] <jose__> it seems to be out of scope or something
[09:39:31] <jose__> since I am loading it to the DOM with the load() function, afterwards I cannot access the value of the code inserted that way
[09:40:04] <ngharo> $ is global so its not out of scope
[09:40:42] <ngharo> jose__: i get the alerts.. ?
[09:41:25] <RedOrigin> is it ok to put php for the value of a .data()?
[09:41:43] <ngharo> ?delegate @ jose__
[09:41:44] <bot-t> jose__, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:42:23] <jose__> thanks bot-t... I will look into the delegate function
[09:43:22] <ngharo> jose__: I think delegate will fix your problem.  When you're load()ing, i think your change handlers are being blown away since you're replacing that part of the DOM
[09:43:56] <jose__> sounds reasonable
[09:45:02] <jose__> I will give it a try.  Thanks
[09:45:26] <ngharo> jose__: http://jsfiddle.net/jWdDw/4/
[09:49:00] <jose__> great!
[09:49:03] <jose__> thanks
[09:57:06] <RedOrigin> is it okay to use php to generate a value for the data() and if it is how do I do it? I mean would I do something like ("div").data('key',{<?php ?>})
[09:58:33] <EdwardIII> hrm
[09:58:39] <jose__> works like a charm :)
[09:58:55] <EdwardIII> i've got a slideDown on an element AND a css hover event. i guess i should supress the css hover in JS?
[09:59:01] <EdwardIII> the jquery slidedown doesn't seem to be happening y'see
[10:00:42] <ngharo> RedOrigin: you would that in the markup
[10:00:57] <ngharo> RedOrigin: <div data-foo="<?php echo $foo ?>" />
[10:01:13] <ngharo> then access it via jQ as $(div).data('foo')
[10:01:58] <RedOrigin> Awesome! You rule ngharo, sorry for taking your time like that.
[10:02:24] <tdskate> hi
[10:21:33] <iatkotep> Does anybody in here happen to know a decent channel for ActionScript?  There are like 6 people on freenode.
[10:32:40] <supsup> sup
[10:34:38] <ryanneufeld> sup supsup
[10:36:45] <supsup> chillin
[10:37:57] <dabear> chillinchillin?
[10:40:26] <supsup> naw
[10:40:30] <supsup> just chillin
[10:49:54] <SkyFlyer> Question... I have a call like this... jQuery.getJSON(options.url, function({});  The URL is behind a .htaccess password?  Anyway to pass in credentials via this getJson???
[10:51:06] <supsup> its the webserver asking you to login right?
[10:51:52] <SkyFlyer> yeah. basic auth i think
[10:51:54] <atrigent> hey guys... when I'm using draggable and droppable, and I drop the draggable on the droppable, does the draggable's "stop" event or the droppable's "drop" event fire first?
[10:52:29] <supsup> i don't think so u coudl get IT department to add your domain to access list tho prob
[10:52:47] <supsup> so access not required fromt aht domain
[10:53:05] <supsup> o h urm maybe in headers it's possible maybe
[10:53:21] <ngharo> SkyFlyer: the $.ajax docs go over that, you should be able to do the same with .getJSON
[10:53:25] <ngharo> ?ajax @ SkyFlyer
[10:53:25] <bot-t> SkyFlyer, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:53:37] <nail_> $.ajax takes 'username' and 'password' params for http authentication
[10:53:52] <ProLoser|Work> does stopPropagation() work with delegate?
[10:54:26] <SkyFlyer> sweet. very nice!
[10:54:28] <supsup> o yah nice it's built in.
[10:54:50] <supsup> never had to use that one ~~
[10:59:23] <SkyFlyer> yeah, thinking of that.  not very secure?
[10:59:50] <supsup> if your testing on test servers its ok, but bad idea for prod
[11:00:12] <supsup> like assuming ur ajax request location has a prod location as well
[11:00:40] <supsup> i doubt u want your server access password in plain text or source  tho.
[11:00:45] <supsup> for prod
[11:06:28] <supsup> might want to check out Oauth for widget data security based on request/specific to a site.
[11:07:24] <ProLoser|Work> if i want the true height of an element do i have to add it up manually?
[11:07:32] <ProLoser|Work> the padding and border and whatnot?
[11:08:09] <ProLoser|Work> nvm, outerHeight
[11:09:53] <supsup> Pro from api page:  method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events. Similarly, events handled by .delegate() will propagate to the elements to which they are delegated;
[11:10:04] <supsup> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:14:04] <ProLoser|Work> the sentence about delegate doesn't make much sense but whatever
[11:16:38] <supsup> i think the answer is no you can't because it's already propegated to the top to trigger the delegate so there is nothing to stop it just executed ocne triggered.  but thats my take on it, prob wrong ;-<
[11:17:26] <BinaryKitten> basically if you use live or delegate on a selector
[11:17:37] <BinaryKitten> and bind to a child of that selector later on
[11:17:55] <BinaryKitten> then the bound can't prevent propagation up to the selector
[11:18:45] <BinaryKitten> because a different mechanism is used to call the live/delegated event
[11:18:50] <BinaryKitten> make more sense?
[11:20:09] <supsup> when you say it can't or you should not?
[11:20:33] <supsup> the api finishes with:  These handlers, therefore, may prevent the delegated handler from triggering by calling event.stopPropagation() or returning false.
[11:20:51] <supsup> i.e., something can block it.
[11:21:05] <supsup> or should that be e.g., hurm
[11:21:25] <BinaryKitten> lol
[11:22:23] <supsup> nope i.e., is right... so BinaryKitten what does that last part of the api spec mean since it's saying you can inadvertly block a delegate or am i reading it wrong?
[11:23:06] <BinaryKitten> urm i think so, though would need to read it fully again
[11:24:43] <supsup> i guess jsfiddle test is in order
[11:26:15] <atrigent> when I'm using draggable and droppable, and I drop the draggable on the droppable, does the draggable's "stop" event or the droppable's "drop" event fire first?
[11:29:16] <ProLoser|Work> am i not able to do $(selector)[1].outerHeight() for some reason?
[11:30:30] <Eviltwin> What?
[11:30:59] <Eviltwin> $(selector).eq(1).outerHeight()
[11:31:06] <Eviltwin> $(selector)[1] is an actual DOM element
[11:31:15] <tktiddle> How can i remove a css class?
[11:31:17] <Eviltwin> Does not have the jQuery functions
[11:31:23] <Eviltwin> ?.removeClass @ tktiddle
[11:31:23] <bot-t> tktiddle, .removeClass([className]): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[11:32:22] <tktiddle> thanks my Eviltwin
[11:35:24] <Ortix>  i need to pass value of a radio button to the load() function
[11:35:27] <Ortix> http://pastebin.com/qL1pXT6S
[11:35:34] <Ortix> is my code
[11:35:37] <Ortix> how would i go about doing that?
[11:36:00] <BinaryKitten> concatenate the value to the string?
[11:36:37] <BinaryKitten> or pass it as the 2nd param
[11:36:58] <Ortix> i am quite new to jquery.. still learing :)
[11:37:01] <Ortix> so i am not sure what you exactly mean
[11:37:08] <Ortix> i read in the docu
[11:37:16] <Ortix> $("#objectID").load("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] } );
[11:37:18] <Ortix> this
[11:37:32] <Ortix> but how do i modify this to suit my need
[11:38:17] <BinaryKitten> orangejuice http://pastebin.com/cZKGaJa3
[11:38:33] <BinaryKitten> oops
[11:38:38] <BinaryKitten> Ortix http://pastebin.com/cZKGaJa3
[11:39:33] <supsup> proLoser :  update this code to show what your trying to do with delegate so i understand better:  http://jsfiddle.net/TPgaM/2/
[11:40:47] <Ortix> so which variable do i get with $_POST in php?
[11:40:56] <Ortix> "this"?
[11:41:02] <Ortix> or type?
[11:41:13] <BinaryKitten> type
[11:41:17] <BinaryKitten> and it's in $_GET
[11:41:21] <BinaryKitten> not $_POS
[11:41:24] <Ortix> okay
[11:41:27] <BinaryKitten> as you're not posting :)
[11:41:33] <Ortix> true true :)
[11:41:58] <Haprog> or you could use $_REQUEST
[11:42:05] <BinaryKitten> bleugh
[11:42:07] <Ortix> any benefits?
[11:42:14] <Haprog> no :P
[11:42:18] <BinaryKitten> $_REQUEST is not good
[11:42:44] <BinaryKitten> especially as you can be caught out with unexepecte data from cookies etc in there
[11:43:54] <Ortix> ok shweet it works!
[11:44:06] <Ortix> but for some reason something else doesn't work
[11:44:12] <Ortix> imma try to figure this out :)
[11:45:24] <Ortix> but goddamnit i love jquery <3
[11:49:28] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having a difficult time getting outerHeight() of an item that's cutoff from view
[11:49:43] <catcher> Hello, I've appended a text element in a mouseover event handler. On mouseout, I want to remove that appended element. What's the best way to do this?
[11:50:46] <ProLoser|Work> wrap it in a tag that you can select?
[11:50:57] <ProLoser|Work> like span for inline or div for block
[11:51:31] <catcher> ProLoser|Work, kk, does that go in the append itself?
[11:51:48] <ProLoser|Work> i am not gonna guess to your code
[11:52:40] <supsup> ProLoser make a jsfiddle example of what your trying to do you will get a lot faster help
[11:52:42] <catcher> ProLoser|Work, not code specific - what's the best way to add an element with a specific class/ID?  is there something better than append?
[11:54:11] <ProLoser|Work> supsup: tried and failed
[11:54:19] <Hopsy> okay if someone knows an answer for my question

[12:07:01] <lucenut> Is it like pastebin?
[12:07:07] <catcher> how can I apply a css change with a fade, while using the .css() function?
[12:07:11] <supsup> better than pastebin

[12:09:39] <catcher> ravenzz, right now, I'm just applying $(this).css({ opacity = 0.3 }), and I'd like it to fade in - just not sure how to wrap the animate/fade class around it
[12:09:41] <Hopsy> no bot-t thats nothing
[12:09:42] <supsup> dang that bot is smart
[12:10:11] <catcher> Do I just apply the css inside animate instead?
[12:10:13] <supsup> ? .animate
[12:10:13] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/

[12:10:22] <bot-t> catcher, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[12:10:22] <catcher> yep, cool, ty
[12:10:36] <catcher> ah, nice!
[12:11:05] <ravenzz> catcher also you can rely on css3 transitions if you don't care about old browsers
[12:11:30] <supsup> yah right he better not be hate'in on IE6 or 5
[12:11:47] <supsup> or FF2 ...etc etc etc
[12:12:14] <catcher> Ahh, how I wish I could abandon them..

[12:13:43] <Rushing> IE5?
[12:14:11] <supsup> ya
[12:14:21] <Rushing> you actually have to target for that?
[12:14:29] <supsup> i don't leave no browser behind yo
[12:14:34] <supsup> Bush taught me this
[12:15:10] <catcher> If I don't wait for the fadeTo to finish, my mouseout doesn't trigger... I imagine this is a common issue, any guidance?
[12:15:35] <supsup> it's better to have a crippled browser array than one full of elite smarties trying to overrun my process.
[12:15:50] <supsup> we still test against links
[12:15:57] <catcher> Is it possible to stop the other animation or anything?

[12:17:34] <Rushing> supsup...it's about as futile as getting your grandpa's 15yr old TV to view HD movies in HD
[12:18:39] <Rushing> if someone comes to you and says "i need you to produce a video that i can watch on this 15yr old tv", you say OK, we'll target that TV. if someone comes to you and says "i need a video in HD and people will be viewing it on this 15yr old tv", you says, "get a new tv"
[12:18:53] <Rushing> or drop the HDreams
[12:19:30] <jeffsmykil> How do I start the document.ready function over again?
[12:19:42] <supsup> what does that mean

[12:20:16] <supsup> and your like why is not triggerin
[12:20:38] <Rushing> jeffsmykil, push F5 ;)
[12:20:48] <jeffsmykil> fair enough
[12:21:39] <Rushing> or create a function and call it again..... var imready() = function{ //do stuff... }; $(document).ready(imready); setTimeout(imready, 5000);
[12:21:58] <jeffsmykil> yeah thats the conclusion i came to
[12:22:59] <supsup> ? .ready()  @ jeffsmykil

[12:40:18] <ries> Hey Guys, anybody knows a query enable HTML drop down that will popup up or down depending where the combo box is located? All com boxes I have seen so far always drop down, and if you add it at the bottom of the page, it get's hidden.
[12:41:49] <supsup> so you don't want to remove it but hide it?
[12:41:56] <blez`> I did it

[12:49:14] <supsup> what do u mean from an image
[12:49:31] <supsup> a keyboard event is a keyboard event it's not a key. or do u mean tabbing over an img or something
[12:50:55] <supsup> err it's not an image i ment heh
[12:57:01] <sadmicrowave> just as an F.Y.I, it appears that $.prop() is faster than $.attr() by 36%

[13:13:37] <JSM87> Hi guys, im using the jquery superfish menu for drop down, All works great except on the iPhone because you cant 'hover' over something, the menu isnt work. Is there a way I can somehow use the click action to trigger what happens usually when you hover your mouse over..
[13:14:11] <JSM87> e.g ion jquery when the menu is clicked it also triggers the .hover() to kick the menu into action as it normally should
[13:15:44] <puppen> JSM87 perhaps this could help http://goo.gl/1Cjq
[13:19:09] <JSM87> puppen: thanks, Just tried this though and it didnt work: http://pastebin.com/11JrXeKK
[13:19:15] <JSM87> Unless I am doing something wrong
[13:19:50] <sadmicrowave> are there any apps or plugins for IE(6) that allow visibility into the DOM like firebug does?
[13:20:07] <dlv> i think the best way to emulate hover is 'long touch' event
[13:22:04] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: Have you tried Firebug lite?
[13:22:28] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, I haven't tried anything because I didn't know what was available
[13:22:49] <Eviltwin> Try Firebug lite
[13:23:21] <JAAulde> ajpiano: how'd your show go?
[13:24:10] <dlv> there is also also 'debugbar' for ie, but it's mostly for dom/css debug
[13:24:16] <meinmkv> any automated web performance tools?
[13:24:27] <meinmkv> reccomendations*
[13:25:17] <meinmkv> been using HttpWatch, didn't know if anyone has used anything better at an enterprise level
[13:27:14] <puppen> JSM: http://jsfiddle.net/puppen/xcj2Y/ .. I had a fiddle.. notice the somewhat odd use of mouseover/hover.
[13:29:13] <Eviltwin> meinmkv: "web" is pretty generic
[13:29:29] <Eviltwin> What do you mean specifically?
[13:30:18] <JSM87> puppen: Thanks for that. What I am trying to do though is kind of "pretend" i have hovered on over the element when I click. This is because oni the iPhone you cant actually hover, only click
[13:30:20] <jedimind> you know, the INTERweb
[13:30:20] <jedimind> duh
[13:30:21] <JSM87> Your code didnt work..
[13:31:18] <JSM87> puppen: Im using the superfish menu which appears to work only on hover, not click, hence on the iPhone it doesnt work right
[13:31:50] <Eviltwin> Why'd you use triggerHandler instead of trigger?
[13:32:04] <Eviltwin> Those events don't bubble (among other things)
[13:32:07] <JSM87> Eviltwin: I also tried trigger too
[13:33:28] <sadmicrowave> ok, sorry for the newb questions...but how do I get firebug lite working in IE? I put the <script> tags in my header as per the stable installation live addition instructions...now what?
[13:33:40] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: Now load the page?
[13:33:46] <sadmicrowave> done
[13:34:01] <sadmicrowave> what am I looking for?
[13:39:32] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, once reloaded there isn't anything to click on to initiate firebug, so how do I view my element?
[13:40:14] <Hopsy> http://www.jesuswillreturn.com/
[13:40:15] <Hopsy> xD
[13:40:42] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: Try pasting this in instead: javascript:(function(F,i,r,e,b,u,g,L,I,T,E){if(F.getElementById(b))return;E=F[i+'NS']&&F.documentElement.namespaceURI;E=E?F[i+'NS'](E,'script'):F[i]('script');E[r]('id',b);E[r]('src',I+g+T);E[r](b,u);(F[e]('head')[0]||F[e]('body')[0]).appendChild(E);E=new%20Image;E[r]('src',I+L);})(document,'createElement','setAttribute','getElementsByTagName','FirebugLite','4','firebug-lite.js','releases/lite/latest/skin

[13:42:13] <Hopsy> wasnt he dead?
[13:42:20] <Eviltwin> In your URL bar
[13:42:24] <Eviltwin> Or in a script tag

[13:44:38] <sadmicrowave> Hopsy, jesus?
[13:44:48] <Hopsy> ugh yes?
[13:45:27] <Hopsy> sadmicrowave: yes?
[13:46:03] <sadmicrowave> Jesus is dead but the christian religion believes he will come back (known as the 'Second Coming')
[13:46:30] <dlv> for what?
[13:47:25] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_(name)
[13:47:53] <Hopsy> "Jesus, the Prophet and Messiah, is alive and will return to the Earth in the near future. We are Muslims who love Jesus, believe in all his miracles and noble morality, know that he will come back to the world again to save humanity and we are eagerly waiting for this great and blessed event to happen. We believe that Jesus would come back to the earth miraculously in the last days and bring peace, justice and happiness by uniting Christians and Muslims in a c
[13:47:53] <Hopsy> ommon religion and morality. Come, let us prepare together for the second coming of Jesus."
[13:47:59] <sadmicrowave> why do I need this?
[13:48:01] <Hopsy> oepz this was too long
[13:48:16] <Hopsy> the muslims also believe in this
[13:48:18] <Hopsy> butt
[13:48:19] <ryanneufeld> Hey, so how about that jQuery thing
[13:48:24] <ryanneufeld> that has nothing to do with religion
[13:48:25] <sadmicrowave> lol
[13:48:32] <ryanneufeld> and this channel is actually about
[13:48:48] <Eviltwin> This channel is about Jesus
[13:48:55] <sadmicrowave> haha
[13:48:55] <necromancer> if i had a function called strToLower(element) { element.val(element.val().toLowerCase()); ), would i experience any kind of performance hit if i converted that to $.fn.strToLower = function() { return this.each(function() { $(this).val($(this).val().toLowerCase()); }); };
[13:49:00] <ravenzz> jEsus
[13:49:05] <Hopsy> jesus isn't dead recording muslims
[13:49:11] <necromancer> s/),/},
[13:49:18] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, that string gives syntax errors
[13:49:45] <Hopsy> This is the channel where everything begins with J
[13:50:37] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: why would you do that////
[13:51:16] <necromancer> ryanneufeld: it looks better. i can type $('#selector').strToLower() or $('#selector').valToLower() if i need to
[13:51:19] <ryanneufeld> ???
[13:52:06] <ryanneufeld> I don't even...
[13:52:12] <andrew9183> Does anyone know why my textarea is remembering what i entered into the textarea and not pulling from my jquery script ?
[13:52:12] <necromancer> to me, function func(jqObj) { var self = jqObj; } is the same as $.fn.func = function() { return this.each(function() { var self = $(this) }) };
[13:52:13] <andrew9183> http://andrew.itracmediav5.com/test.html
[13:52:30] <necromancer> but that's all
[13:52:39] <necromancer> i mean this really offers no benefits fundamentally than making it a simple JS function
[13:52:39] <andrew9183> i create the instance everytime i click on the header to edit, but it still pulls the old value, and not the header value
[13:52:42] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: adding to $.fn would just be a plugin
[13:52:45] <ryanneufeld> nothingwrong with that
[13:52:53] <necromancer> i know
[13:52:56] <ryanneufeld> if it's something you're doing a lot
[13:53:00] <ryanneufeld> makes sense I suppose
[13:53:05] <necromancer> basically my idea is to turn all of my functions into jQuery "plugins"
[13:53:27] <ryanneufeld> that's just silly
[13:53:29] <necromancer> just wondering if doing that would be a bad idea
[13:54:03] <ryanneufeld> if there was something 'wrong
[13:54:08] <ryanneufeld> ' about doing it that way
[13:54:15] <ryanneufeld> i wouldn't be able to judge
[13:54:20] <necromancer> well think about it, wouldn't the code be more understandable if it was $('#selector').myFunction() rather than myFunction($('#selector'))?
[13:54:42] <dlv> necromancer  you have DRY sickness :P
[13:54:52] <necromancer> i'm parched ;)
[13:55:14] <ryanneufeld> necromancer: I don't usually call my code that way

[13:55:48] <troynt> anyone using Qunit with RequireJS?
[13:56:01] <Hopsy> troynt: ask your question
[13:56:33] <necromancer> troynt: i used jasmine with requireJS until i got sick of it missing files and such, so now i test with <script src>s only...
[13:56:49] <andrew9183> anyone know ?
[13:56:54] <necromancer> when i go live, i use require to compile & minify
[13:56:59] <troynt> I'm having trouble getting asynctest to work after using RequireJS to load Qunit and tests
[13:57:03] <troynt> it works without RequireJS
[13:57:22] <troynt> most of the tests run okay, ones that do not require asynctest
[13:58:06] <necromancer> troynt: what kind of errors do you get? are they 404s in the Net of random files?
[13:58:56] <troynt> "Died on test #1: b is null" which is pretty meaningless :-\
[13:59:19] <troynt> the error message doesn't make any sense
[13:59:32] <ravenzz> b is null <- ?
[14:00:07] <troynt> oh wait, I should of checked the console... seeing error there now
[14:00:08] <troynt> doh
[14:00:14] <troynt> sorry
[14:04:14] <sadmicrowave> Alright, I thought if I got an IE DOM viewer it might help me pinpoint my problem, but it didn't show where the issue is so I need some help...
[14:05:07] <sadmicrowave> I have a function that gets executed and appends content to a ui-dialog element.  This function appends the content perfectly and consistently in FF but in IE it only works if the commented line is uncommented: http://pastebin.com/6yDX9JAb
[14:05:38] <dlv> sadmicrowave did you try debugbar?
[14:05:41] <sadmicrowave> for whatever reason, IE6 is only executing the append function if the commented append is included....
[14:06:14] <sadmicrowave> dlv, no I'll install and try, but in the meantime, maybe you (and others) could look and shed some light on more of IE's flaws
[14:07:20] <s5fs> Anyone have an example of a jquery mobile site with form validation?
[14:07:27] <sadmicrowave> dlv, also, debugbar is only going to give me visibility into the DOM (which is what firebug lite did).  My thought was that I could check the DOM after the append function and see if my content was actually being appended...and it is not
[14:07:43] <dlv> sadmicrowave, could you use jsfiddle or jsbin instead? cuz it's really hard to investigate bugs while you even don't see them
[14:08:22] <sadmicrowave> dlv, hold on
[14:10:21] <sadmicrowave> dlv, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/KvuVp/3/
[14:16:40] <bmidgley> is there a validator you guys like that uses a pure javascript object rather than dom markup to represent the rules?
[14:16:53] <bmidgley> I'd like something I can share with couchdb server-side js validations
[14:17:25] <bmidgley> jquery validation plugin wants rules to be in the dom, written into the form
[14:18:39] <sadmicrowave> dlv, geez this is frustrating
[14:20:40] <kborchers> bmidgley: that's not true ... you can specify all of your rules in the rules object when setting up the validator. Here is the simplest example http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/required
[14:20:40] <dlv> sadmicrowave i just, did not get get what should i see
[14:21:20] <sadmicrowave> dlv, on save button click you should see the error box appended to the dialog body
[14:21:26] <sadmicrowave> in FF this function works perfectly
[14:21:38] <sadmicrowave> in IE6 this does not work
[14:22:31] <dlv> IE6 srsly? oh-oh :(
[14:22:46] <sadmicrowave> yes
[14:23:09] <bmidgley> kborchers I see what you mean. Maybe I could share that whole object that is passed into validate method with my couch app
[14:23:32] <dv310p3r> I've need to run a function within a 3rd party plugin. The plugin is a simple slideshow, and I need to pause and play the slideshow from outside the plugin. The plugin has the methods within it to do so. How can run those functions based on a click event.
[14:24:38] <sadmicrowave> I hate IE
[14:25:31] <phlp> amen brother microwave
[14:25:46] <necromancer> sadmicrowave: z-index
[14:25:49] <dlv> sadmicrowave, even microsoft don't use IE already
[14:26:02] <`WarpKat> i think the majority of intelligent people are in whole-hearted concurrence with that sentiment.
[14:26:18] <necromancer> sadmicrowave: your error div doesn't have a z-index set to it, so it's appearing underneath the dialog. set a higher z-index to it and make it position:relative
[14:26:27] <Caraes_Naur> hey guys, I've got a timing issue that's annoying me
[14:26:28] <necromancer> IE 6/7 sucks for z-index and positioning
[14:27:04] <miceiken> $('#errormsg > h2').after('<div class="alert-message><p><strong>' + fileObj.name + '</strong><br />' + errorObj.type + ': ' + errorObj.info + '</p></div>'); <- how come this is wrong? html -> http://pastebin.com/kk8kzju1
[14:28:02] <Hopsy> miceiken: can you help me?
[14:28:09] <miceiken> huh
[14:28:10] <miceiken> with what
[14:28:15] <sadmicrowave> necromancer, that solves the problem but I need the error message at the bottom of the element, so it needs to be position:absolute; bottom:0px; unless there is another way to make it appear at the bottom
[14:28:21] <Hopsy> do you believe in creatism?
[14:28:29] <miceiken> sure
[14:28:32] <sadmicrowave> oh geez
[14:28:34] <ryanneufeld> Hopsy, go away
[14:28:35] <Hopsy> join #biology :p

[14:28:42] <imsky> creatism?
[14:29:00] <Hopsy> creationism *
[14:29:01] <s5fs> he meant "cretinism"
[14:29:11] <sadmicrowave> lol
[14:29:29] <znow> https://gist.github.com/1310365 <- I got a list of posts, each with a "add comment link", when I press the add comment link, the add_comment div slideToggle's(slides down). but, when I press it, ALL the add_comment div's, for each posts gets slided, anyone know the "selector" I should use, so only the one I press is getting its add_comment div slided?
[14:29:44] <necromancer> sadmicrowave: that's one way to do it, but relative positioning is more fluid
[14:30:12] <pifantastic> znow: you probably want something like this: $(this).find(".add_comment").slideToggle();
[14:30:35] <pifantastic> znow: assuming .add_comment is a child of .add_comment_link
[14:30:45] <pifantastic> otherwise I need to see your HTML
[14:30:46] <miceiken> $('#errormsg > h2').after('<div class="alert-message><p><strong>' + fileObj.name + '</strong><br />' + errorObj.type + ': ' + errorObj.info + '</p></div>'); <- how come this is wrong? html -> http://pastebin.com/kk8kzju1
[14:30:58] <znow> pifantastic: sec ill gist my html (haml that is)
[14:31:04] <pifantastic> znow: cool
[14:31:18] <vladikoff> Hopsy, hi
[14:31:47] <Hopsy> hey vladikoff, why do you always greet me and doesnt say anything after that :p
[14:32:03] <znow> pifantastic: https://gist.github.com/1310376
[14:32:07] <pifantastic> I guess he says hi and then hopsy way
[14:32:15] <vladikoff> Hopsy, how is your day?
[14:32:22] <Hopsy> :D
[14:32:28] <miceiken> Hopsy, how is your dad? wait, im here, and im good
[14:32:32] <Hopsy> well, its a little bit boring

[14:33:43] <Hopsy> the what :\
[14:33:45] <sadmicrowave> necromancer, is there another way to use relative positioning and achieve the result I'm looking for?
[14:34:19] <Hopsy> vladikoff: and how about your day?
[14:34:28] <wookiehangover> Hopsy its been so long
[14:34:32] <wookiehangover> too long
[14:34:40] <Hopsy> yess
[14:34:44] <znow> pifantastic: lovely, thank you!
[14:34:51] <necromancer> sadmicrowave: yeah you could set margin-top. i can't see your use-case (and it displayed weird in jsfiddle due to lack of space), but what i'd do is set a margin-top so it's spaced a certain amount of px from the last content in the dialog
[14:35:01] <Hopsy> wauw, I am famous
[14:35:05] <Caraes_Naur> could someone look at this?  http://jsfiddle.net/pPcxQ/
[14:35:13] <pifantastic> znow: understand why it works?
[14:35:15] <Hopsy> I got tears in my eyes
[14:35:45] <sadmicrowave> necromancer, margin-top would have to be a variable then because I don't necessarily know how many pixels from the last element it would need to be placed
[14:36:25] <znow> pifantastic: hmm yeah, when I click the add comment link, it selects the add comment that is next to it
[14:36:28] <znow> which I have clicked
[14:36:45] <pifantastic> znow: yup. cool.  Just making sure it made sense to you.
[14:37:19] <dlv> sadmicrowave, dude, you forgot to put class to quotes, did not you?
[14:37:48] <Hopsy> wookiehangover: how are you?

[14:39:40] <miceiken> Nothing changes, and no errors
[14:39:46] <sadmicrowave> dlv, class to quotes? where?
[14:40:06] <sadmicrowave> ^and what does that mean?
[14:41:54] <s5fs> sadmicrowave: you didn't put matching double quotes around alert-message. thats what they're saying.
[14:42:19] <pifantastic> miceiken: I see no h2 in your HTML
[14:42:24] <pifantastic> so that selector is not going to match
[14:42:27] <pifantastic> right?
[14:42:33] <dlv> sadmicrowave, http://jsbin.com/epekus/5
[14:42:39] <dlv> try it out
[14:42:49] <miceiken> huh i dont get it pifantastic
[14:42:52] <miceiken> there is a h2
[14:43:03] <pifantastic> ohlol
[14:43:05] <pifantastic> thereis
[14:43:07] <pifantastic> I didnt see it
[14:44:29] <dlv> sadmicrowave, you should put class literal to quotes( 'class': 'ui-user-options' ), cuz 'class' is preserved keyword
[14:45:24] <phlp> one of those keyword mummies
[14:45:50] <sadmicrowave> dlv, oh yes, I see what youre talking about now, I already changed that thank you
[14:46:56] <codepoet_> I'm having a brain fart and I can't find it in the doc -- what is the call to remotely fetch the content of a page and assign it to an element?  I thought it was .location but that's not it :(
[14:47:12] <codepoet_> I can do it manually but I swore there was a method to help with it
[14:47:17] <ngharo> ?load

[14:47:31] <codepoet_> thanks :)
[14:47:46] <codepoet_> At least I remember two letters :)
[14:48:05] <dlv> sadmicrowave, so everything is working fine now?
[14:48:47] <sadmicrowave> dlv, except for the styling, yes.  Still trying to position the appended element at the absolute bottom of the parent element
[14:49:51] <pifantastic> miceiken: you have a missing " in your HTML string
[14:50:01] <pifantastic> miceiken: you never close the class attribute with a second "
[14:50:21] <pifantastic> miceiken: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/JxTLC/3/
[14:50:21] <RedOrigin> what's a good way to dynamically create .click(function{replaceWith()}? I have these divs on my page [id^=fvs] and want to replace the contents of #container when one is clicked with a content that is on a table.
[14:50:32] <phlp> sadmicrowave: have you tried position:relative on the parent and position:absolute + bottom:0 on appended
[14:50:46] <pifantastic> RedOrigin: you only need 1 .click
[14:51:03] <RedOrigin> one for each div id
[14:51:07] <pifantastic> nope, just 1
[14:51:20] <pifantastic> do you have something that can relate the tables to their corresponding divs?
[14:51:36] <andrew9183> anyone know why my textarea (when i click the guiness text) will persist with old values even though it pulls it from the html ? is it because the page is cached and pulls it from that?

[14:58:37] <Hopsy> no u :(
[14:58:41] <bignick345> hey guys...i got a website i needed done and my web design company proposed $50,000. can you tell me if that's fair? i want a website where people can sign up and customize a page with colors/logos/etc... (like myspace, but for business) and have custom API buttons built. am i overpaying or underpaying or is that fair? thx!!
[14:58:45] <sadmicrowave> you annoy me
[14:58:59] <phlp> sadmicrowave: it works in ie8 for me after I put quotes around class. is it an older one that has problems?
[14:59:07] <Hopsy> okay then I will quit this channel
[14:59:09] <Hopsy> bye
[14:59:30] <pifantastic> bignick345: that's probably fair but there is no way to truly answer that without seeing your full RFP
[14:59:32] <sadmicrowave> phlp, yes IE6, but I've already put quotes around class (and all other object keys)
[15:00:06] <pifantastic> but if your question is, "How much do websites usually cost?", it's very often in the $50,000-150,000 range
[15:01:47] <bignick345> hmm i see
[15:02:05] <bignick345> so they're not ripping me off then? because at first i saw $50,000 i was like WHAT
[15:02:17] <geekbri> i mean thats a really vague question, it really depends on the specs of the website what it will cost
[15:02:23] <bignick345> because you go on freelancer.com and other places and developers are say they'd do it for like $2000 lol
[15:02:45] <GranMal> I'm using window.open to open a printable screen in a new tab ... Problem is, when I leave the new tab open, and try to create another open tab, the first tab is updated ... Is there a workaround to get the old tab to not update, and the a new tab to be opened? https://gist.github.com/1310465 <-- Code here is being used in a callback
[15:03:25] <dlv> sadmicrowave you are saying what you don't see alert in in ie6, right? or i disunderstood something
[15:04:09] <dlv> GranMal, change title
[15:04:23] <sadmicrowave> dlv, thats correct. I don't see it because something is wrong with IE6's interpretation of the div style tag
[15:04:41] <pifantastic> bignick345: anything done for $2000 will probably be a pile of garbage
[15:06:01] <s5fs> bignick345: there's a lot that goes into spec'ing a website. take "a shopping cart", sounds simple, right? but.. are you selling one product or are you amazon.com? pretty broad range of options for such a simple concept.
[15:06:30] <sadmicrowave> dlv, this is the newest post I have: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/KvuVp/6/
[15:06:31] <s5fs> bignick345: in general, your developers should be providing you a quote with a rough breakdown of effort. you can use this to drill into the quote and help understand where the cost lies.
[15:06:44] <phlp> "custom API buttons" is pretty vague as well i have no idea what that means
[15:08:24] <s5fs> bignick345: also, i'm in the US and my rate is $85-$125/hr depending on what I'm working on. as such, $2k gets burned up pretty quickly. something to keep in mind.
[15:08:47] <necromancer> bignick345: yeah that sounds about right
[15:09:02] <necromancer> for a social network? "myspace for <whatever>"? hell yeah. $50k
[15:09:05] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: get back you SOB
[15:09:16] <necromancer> phlp: first thought i had was it's like facebook like buttons
[15:10:44] <necromancer> bignick345: you're creating an online community WITH an API. it's going to take an extraordinarily long amount of time, and will probably be responsible for a good chunk of that company's business.
[15:10:58] <gnarf> ?
[15:11:00] <necromancer> a lot of people who create sites like this actually HIRE a team of full-time developers
[15:11:26] <necromancer> bignick345: and most likely, the kind of devs you want are going to be $50,000 per person
[15:12:06] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: talk quick, i gotta run soon
[15:12:20] <ajpiano> it's safe to say that if you get a 50,000 estimate for a project and you yourself have no idea whether that's reasonable compared to offers that are 25 times cheaper thatn you might not be in a position to direct a project of that size....
[15:12:30] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: eh nm then was gonna ask you about rebase
[15:12:41] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: i never rebase
[15:12:44] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: if you didn't notice my huge mistake in commit messages
[15:12:49] <gnarf> ajpiano might be able to help
[15:12:52] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: yeah the github help said to do that to change commit messages
[15:12:56] <Dave_Stein> yeah i'll ask him then
[15:13:14] <Dave_Stein> he already knows what i did
[15:13:16] <Dave_Stein> via scrabble chat
[15:13:16] <Dave_Stein> lol
[15:13:20] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: whats' up
[15:13:29] <ajpiano> i barely knew what you were talking about there though
[15:13:32] <ajpiano> lol
[15:13:35] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: https://github.com/DaveStein/jquery-ui/commits/interactions
[15:13:40] <Dave_Stein> does osmething look weird?
[15:13:41] <Dave_Stein> lol
[15:13:56] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:14:01] <Dave_Stein> it duplicated my messages and didn't even take my changes
[15:14:02] <Dave_Stein> :(
[15:14:15] <ajpiano> just branch again off master and cherry-pick one set of the good commits off
[15:14:29] <gnarf> if you cherry-pick -n
[15:14:36] <gnarf> you get a chance to change the commit message too
[15:14:52] <gnarf> -n means "no commit" in that context
[15:15:07] <Dave_Stein> i'm too used to right-clicking in SVN and just clicking "edit log message"
[15:15:35] <dlv> sadmicrowave, http://www.screenr.com/ZnGs, where is the problem? :\
[15:15:41] <Dave_Stein> i don't wanna eff up again so actually i'll get help from you later ajpiano, watch out
[15:15:50] <ajpiano> ok
[15:18:21] <sneakyness> Guys I don't want to fix these gross onClick events in these PHP templates, so I'm going to whine about it here for now
[15:18:51] <davemo> whine away
[15:19:15] <bignick345> got it
[15:19:18] <bignick345> thanks guys!
[15:19:29] <sneakyness> They aren't even doing return false, and then the same guy that wrote the code is filing a bug saying it's not being ajax and is reloading the whole page
[15:19:31] <bignick345> didnt know web apps were that expensive
[15:20:09] <davemo> you get what you pay for bignick345
[15:20:10] <DJ_UNA> anyone familiar with the stickyfloat? It only want to be visible when I start to scroll the page :<
[15:21:01] <s5fs> bignick345: good quality developers are expensive, regardless of technology
[15:21:24] <sneakyness> and english isn't even this dudes first language
[15:21:27] <sneakyness> so much frustrationg
[15:24:17] <sadmicrowave> dlv, I'm not sure what is going on then, I'll just keep playing with it
[15:24:20] <sadmicrowave> thanks for the help
[15:24:45] <context> thats what she said
[15:28:54] <Heshanh> can u do .serialize() on an array? i have a from that needs to post to campaign monitor but i have to format some of the data before i sent it
[15:29:04] <ShaunR> right now i create a dialog and then issue a "open" when the button is clicked.  Why couldnt i just create the dialog when the button is clicked.  Seams like all the examples i see always create the dialog first with a autoOpen: false.
[15:31:45] <Gho5t> i have a custom checkbox that work great but when a reset button is clicked it's not resetting. What event do I need to bind to?
[15:31:48] <MTPrower> Hiya awesome fun peeps. Can I find some basic jquery help here?
[15:32:16] <`WarpKat> sure
[15:32:32] <coldhead> MTPrower: that will depend on your ability to actually ask for help :)
[15:32:36] <Gho5t> you know it's a faux checkbox
[15:32:42] <Gho5t> that has a hidden input
[15:32:43] <coldhead> so far it isn't looking good
[15:32:45] <Gho5t> but shows an image
[15:32:49] <MTPrower> Alright. I have a jquery slideshow that seems to be working just fine, but I need to make the images fluid.
[15:33:03] <joikus> you guys
[15:33:07] <Gho5t> how do i make it so the reset button will trigger the image to change in the checkbox?
[15:33:17] <joikus> How can I nicely display a table with 10 columns, on a mobile via jquery mobile
[15:33:45] <Gho5t> joikus that is a stupid question
[15:33:53] <joikus> why?
[15:33:59] <Gho5t> i dunno
[15:34:12] <ngharo> Gho5t: you'll have to bind to onreset of the form, or create a custom click for your reset button
[15:34:13] <Gho5t> probably cause it is interrupting mine
[15:34:40] <MTPrower> My site, which I'm building right now, is http://www.vgreboot.com/ . I need to find a way to make the images use overflow: hidden. Because apparently I can't do it via the CSS files, and #css won't help me.
[15:34:47] <Gho5t> ngharo: then i will have to keep track of state changes for the checkbo?
[15:34:54] <Gho5t> so i can handle the reset logic?
[15:35:47] <`WarpKat> what're you using for the slideshow?
[15:35:49] <Gho5t> garbage
[15:35:53] <ngharo> Gho5t: yeah i guess
[15:35:55] <coldhead> MTPrower: any ideas on why it can't be done with CSS?
[15:36:19] <MTPrower> coldhead: Maybe I just haven't found the right element. I'm not much of a coder of any kind...
[15:36:21] <Gho5t> why doesn't reset fire the onchange event
[15:37:04] <MTPrower> coldhead: I have Firebug. I said before that I want fluid images, but I can definitely settle with a working overflow: hidden with the current site's fluid width
[15:37:42] <MTPrower> coldhead: I use something called TheTheFly Image Slider
[15:37:50] <coldhead> MTPrower: if you right click on the image and choose Inspect Element you should see on the CSS pane at right the list of CSS rules that currently apply
[15:38:11] <coldhead> and you should also be able to experiment with the CSS by adding to to the element there
[15:38:14] <coldhead> to see what works
[15:38:17] <MTPrower> coldhead: Had that open all evening. Can't find the element to edit yet.
[15:38:28] <coldhead> then you just need to work out a good CSS rule to target it
[15:38:41] <Heshanh> anyone know if i can do .serialize() on an array and get the same effect as doing it on a form?
[15:38:48] <Heshanh> effect as in format
[15:39:03] <MTPrower> coldhead: I'm not that smart. Wouldn't know where to begin. I've made, I dunno... four custom elements in my life...
[15:40:16] <andornaut> I have a fn bar() that is called on the change event. In it, I get the element that fired the event with var el = $(this); If I want to wrap that fn in another, foo = function() { var el = $(this); /* some code */ bar(); ... } How do I set the "this" context for the bar() fn?
[15:40:30] <coldhead> time to level up then, MTPrower
[15:40:39] <coldhead> happy to help, less inclined to do it for you :P
[15:40:58] <MTPrower> coldhead: Yeah, I've reached my limit
[15:41:09] <ajpiano> andornaut: use .call or .apply
[15:41:12] <ajpiano> ?mdc call @ andornaut
[15:41:13] <bot-t> andornaut, call - MDN - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[15:41:54] <andornaut> Thanks ajpiano
[15:43:37] <coldhead> MTPrower: maybe #main {overflow-x:hidden} ?
[15:44:43] <Eviltwin> I didn't know there was a <maybe> tag
[15:45:56] <MTPrower> coldhead: thanks. Didn't know overflow-[x or y] existed. Only overflow:
[15:49:05] <Eviltwin> MTPrower: http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/css/propindex/all.htm
[15:49:15] <Eviltwin> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html
[15:51:15] <MTPrower> Alright, nothing I can do via CSS will hide the part of the images that should be overflow:hidden. I've tried everything now. There's GOT to be another way, or something I'm missing...
[15:52:44] <Zzaichik> do you have the width and height specified?  block element or display set to block?
[16:07:51] <Hopsy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc_Uw00ESA4
[16:15:00] <Snerf> I am using .hover with a div which changes the background-image, but it has a <div> inside it, so when that is being hovered, it thinks the hover isnt triggered on the parent div, and changes the bg image. how can I prevent this?
[16:20:48] <SkyFlyer> anyone have a select with Language and code I can get?  ?
[16:27:27] <Heshanh> can some one tell me what im doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/HJBuA/ missing : after property id ( cm-name: $('input[name=cm-name]').val() )
[16:37:10] <JonBa> I'm having a really hard time with queue control.  I've been over a dozen attempts of various methods...I know this is completely wrong, but it should illustrate what I'm trying to do:  http://jsfiddle.net/qzHuR/
[16:40:12] <ajpiano> JonBa: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[16:40:18] <cauethenorio> Heshanh: Do you can't use serialize? http://jsfiddle.net/HJBuA/1/
[16:44:32] <JonBa> ajpiano:  that seems difficult to apply to a broader range of situations.  He's just using increasingly shorthand ways of applying the same effect to multiple items
[16:44:52] <ajpiano> ...
[16:45:12] <ajpiano> the point is... the function calls the next iteration of the loop when it ends
[16:45:17] <ajpiano> do whatever logic you want
[16:45:41] <ajpiano> iteration of the "loop"
[16:50:22] <JonBa> Not following, sorry....like this?  http://jsfiddle.net/qzHuR/2/
[16:50:42] <ajpiano> step 1 is ditching the for loop
[16:50:55] <JonBa> Or are you saying each part of that line needs to use callback...because prependTo doesn't seem to support that
[16:51:20] <ajpiano> i'm not saying that at all
[16:51:50] <JonBa> the for loop is just simplifying code that isn't relevant to this problem
[16:51:58] <JonBa> I'm looping through ajax returned info
[16:52:00] <ajpiano> the for loop *is* the problem
[16:52:10] <ajpiano> any thing where you're looping over all of them
[16:52:11] <ajpiano> is the problem
[16:52:21] <ajpiano> because it just does each iteration of the loop, it doesn't care about your delay
[16:53:12] <JonBa> interesting, ok
[16:53:50] <pifantastic> :D
[16:53:55] <ddoom_> I am having an issue when triggering a click event on a checkbox, it seems that the checked prop isn't getting updated - I have an example of what I am trying to do here - http://jsfiddle.net/nLheD/5/
[16:54:13] <pifantastic> JonBa: this is like, THE interview question you will get if you ever apply for a Javascript job
[16:54:54] <pifantastic> ddoom_: I think triggering a click event on a checkbox will just fire any attached events, it won't perfectly simulate a user actually doing it
[16:55:16] <pifantastic> ddoom_: why dont you just use $('.my_checkbox').attr('checked', 'checked') ?
[16:56:09] <Dregian> Anyone here ËË?
[16:56:16] <JonBa> So I get 10 updates back, I want to show each one, with a 1 sec delay between each...and for loop isn't the way?
[16:56:30] <ajpiano> no
[16:56:41] <ddoom_> pifantastic: I need to update corresponding text fields
[16:58:01] <Dregian> Ah ËË, I currently have a simple element with a child '<div id="id"><span></span></div>' - how do I get the entire element? So '<div id="id"><span></span></div>' because .html() only returns '<span></span>'
[16:58:30] <ddoom_> JonBa: take this with a grain of salt, try setTimeout
[16:59:39] <Heshanh> <cauethenorio> : cant use serialize cos theres a checkbox array and the serialize val for them arent excepted by campaign monitor
[17:00:40] <Seateng> join #redis
[17:00:49] <Dregian> Does anyone know that :P?
[17:02:10] <JonBa> dragian:  I'd guess $("#id').parent().html();
[17:02:42] <ajpiano> ?g jquery outerhtml yelotofu @ Dregian

[17:05:49] * dross stretche
[17:05:50] <dross> s
[17:06:45] <dross> would be nice if the jquery-ui team included projects like menubar, etc
[17:06:53] <dross> make jquery-ui more on par with Dojo
[17:07:19] <ajpiano> there is a menu component in 1.9
[17:07:35] <dross> oh hey there aj :)
[17:07:39] <ajpiano> hi dross
[17:07:42] <dross> obviously I've used Dojo more
[17:07:51] <ajpiano> yeah
[17:07:52] * dross is spoiled with fancy widgets
[17:07:56] <ajpiano> jquery ui pretty clearly isn't dojo
[17:08:08] <dross> I know.. but it has improved quite a bit
[17:08:16] <ajpiano> indeed :)
[17:08:20] <dross> jquery mobile is something I've been interested in too
[17:08:39] <ajpiano> yeah, mobile is cool,  there is hopefully gonna be some convergence there
[17:14:05] <ddoom_> http://dojotoolkit.org/widgets it's like windows 2000 on the web
[17:17:28] <JonBa> So what if not a for loop?
[17:20:41] <ddoom_> setTimeout(function(){ //do something with array[i]; i++}, 1000);
[17:21:38] <ddoom_> then obviously clear the timeout when you're done with it - just an idea
[17:22:26] <JonBa> Won't that just run it all at once, one second later?
[17:23:32] <ajpiano> JonBa: this is not nearly as elegant as it could be
[17:23:36] <ajpiano> but it should make the idea clearer
[17:23:37] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/qzHuR/3/
[17:24:03] <ajpiano> you use the callback of each thing to say "hey, trigger the next one"
[17:28:18] <JonBa> OK, yeah, so that makes it sequential, where would I add the 1 sec pause between each call?
[17:29:06] <JonBa> oh nvm
[17:29:15] <JonBa> I'll just slip a delay() in before slidedown
[17:29:47] <ajpiano> yeah or wrap the process(i) in setTimeout(
[17:46:29] <Kunda> if jquery is already imported on page load, how do i tell other scripts to use it but not conflict with each other.. which is what's happening here: http://tinyurl.com/3zgle52

[17:47:57] <Kunda> thanks
[17:48:31] <jdarto> hey there. i'm developing a plugin using the widget factory. is there a conventional way to expose static methods? i need methods that apply to the plugin as a whole. any ideas?
[17:50:55] <ajpiano> you could tack it onto the namespace ? $.your.widget.thing = function() { }
[17:56:07] <jdarto> thanks adam!
[17:56:39] <ajpiano> np :)
[17:57:54] <jdarto> i guess i'll just attach an old-school plugin to $.myPlugin, unless there's any way to attach a... "static widget"?
[17:58:11] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what you're really after
[18:00:11] <jdarto> i need a set of methods to interface with the plugin as a whole rather than individual elements. three.js lighting parameters for example.
[18:01:46] <ajpiano> i wouldn't just go tacking $.foo if $.yournamespace.foo also exists
[18:01:51] <ajpiano> but that's just me
[18:02:03] <foo> ajpiano: I wouldn't either.
[18:02:10] <ajpiano> sorry bro
[18:02:13] <ajpiano> that must happen a lot
[18:03:14] <foo> ajpiano: it's ok, I'm popular. ;)
[18:03:16] <jdarto> $.yournamespace.foo being created by the widget?
[18:03:31] <ajpiano> yeah, that's where it stores the prototype that you create via the widget factory
[18:03:59] <jdarto> ah i thought it was in $.fn.namespace.widget
[18:04:09] <ajpiano> $.widget("baz.coolify', {}) creates $.baz.coolify.prototype
[18:04:09] <jdarto> err $.prototype
[18:06:07] <jdarto> hmm so is there a better way to do it? $.someOtherName.doSomething = function(){...}?
[18:08:00] <ajpiano> i'm just saying i'd attach static methods to the prototype where it exists ...
[18:12:49] <jdarto> i'd like to be able to call it as $.myPlugin("methodA", options). any chance of that?
[18:20:46] <k776> Hey. How can I detect a click on the same option of a checkbox
[18:21:02] <k776> Adding change/click handlers to both the option and select tags doesn't appear to work
[18:22:10] <fabianhjr> hi, I am trying to dynamically change the content of my page with a #section on the URI. So far I am using .html() to change the content of a div within the page. However the later part has so far escaped me. This is the first time I use jQuery.
[18:22:29] <coldhead> what is the later part?
[18:22:50] <fabianhjr> So for instance site.com/help#faq is different from site.com/help#assistance
[18:22:51] <coldhead> accessing window.location.hash?
[18:24:49] <fabianhjr> Is it that simple? So in the test for the button I just add an || window.location.hash == Â¨#pageÂ¨?
[18:27:42] <fabianhjr> Dunno, is there something more practical for a nav? I would detest having to write two times every menu option and two ways to dial it on the JS.
[18:28:59] <coldhead> fabianhjr: have you looked at libs like ben alman's BBQ that look after #hash based nav for you?
[18:31:31] <fabianhjr> coldhead: dunno, learning all this and it is due tomorrow. :/
[18:31:59] <coldhead> maybe you can afford the detestable option in view of the deadline
[18:32:09] <fabianhjr> Originally it had to use the shitty frame nav model. Want to keep something similar while allowing bookmarking.
[18:32:16] <coldhead> you might be able to use a preprocessor to cut down on repeating yourself
[18:32:19] <fabianhjr> :P Good point.
[18:32:37] <coldhead> or you might just copy paste like crazy
[18:32:46] <fabianhjr> Not really. It is a HS 10th grade do it HTML load it off the machine the teacher is using.
[18:33:01] <coldhead> blergh
[18:33:52] <fabianhjr> lol
[18:35:02] <jahrichie> I wana use jquery to load the entire page before displaying anything
[18:35:03] <fabianhjr> How would you add the hast to the location without reloading?
[18:35:11] <jahrichie> any recommendations?
[18:35:50] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: that happens by default as far as my DOM understanding goes.
[18:36:34] <fabianhjr> So, some people mess with the parser and make it spit as it loads. Though that is because they want to read the contents faster, even if it looks messed up from the beginning.
[18:36:50] <overtherainbow> What causes an ajax request to fail? Like, for example, user makes an ajax call, but then I find that the user has insufficient permissions to do what they want. what do I have the API return?
[18:36:52] <Davey> is there an official jquery template plugin?
[18:37:18] <Davey> overtherainbow: any 400 or 500 error, whichever is appropriate
[18:37:26] <Davey> (in your case, probably 403 Permission Denied)
[18:37:41] <overtherainbow> ...Yeah. That was dumb of me. Thanks Davey.
[18:37:46] <Davey> :)
[18:39:36] <fabianhjr> Any help on why the text doesnÂ´t change? http://pastebin.com/rbAFRnEh
[18:41:12] <jahrichie> on second thought i don't like that idea, what about using a loading gif for a div until all the images are loaded, any recommendations ?
[18:41:51] <coldhead> the official plugin is abandoned, Davey
[18:41:56] <coldhead> there are lots of others
[18:42:05] <Davey> coldhead: I'm thinking about just using sprintf
[18:42:20] <coldhead> gross
[18:42:26] <ryanseddon> fabianhjr: cause you set your script type to text/js so the browser never parses it and ignores it
[18:42:26] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: what do you want to load? a <video> ?
[18:42:32] <coldhead> but if that does the trick :)
[18:43:05] <ryanseddon> leave the type attribute out it doesn't even need to be there
[18:43:06] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: nah, the images in my portfolio
[18:43:18] <fabianhjr> It works! Awful type=Â¨text/javascriptÂ¨ got me again. Why must I always type it? What other scripting languages are available or in use?
[18:43:21] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: prob just do the entire div containing the portfolio ?
[18:44:10] <coldhead> fabianhjr: if you're using a modern doctype you shouldn't need the text param
[18:44:27] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: you could use jQuery to write from the header into the page and on $(document).ready(function() { just remove the gif.
[18:44:59] <fabianhjr> coldhead: HTML5 <!DOCTYPE html> under webkit for Chrome 11 or something.
[18:45:13] <fabianhjr> That is what I thought too. Apparently not.
[18:45:30] <overtherainbow> I have a PHP page, with a button on it. onClick the button calls a javascript function. Does this javascript function get passed any data? If so, what? If not, how can I pass it data?
[18:45:33] <coldhead> fabianhjr: http://doctype.com/html5-optional-type-property-script
[18:47:14] <fabianhjr> coldhead: well, apparently up to date chrome doesnÂ´t like to default
[18:47:42] <fabianhjr> $("#cont").html("My text is changed!"); How can I load a document such as html("index.txt"); ?
[18:48:43] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: something like 	jQuery('#loading-image').hide(); ?
[18:49:13] <fabianhjr> Yeah, at least that is an idea that comes to mind.
[18:49:22] <coldhead> that can't be right, fabianhjr, that would stop JS working in half the web
[18:49:22] <fabianhjr> I am a newb so just try it and see if it works. :P
[18:49:33] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: same ish
[18:49:45] <jahrichie> i use plenty of jquery but i'm NO expert
[18:49:57] <fabianhjr> This is my first time with jQuery :3
[18:50:11] <fabianhjr> Or JS for that matter.
[18:50:48] <jahrichie> ahh
[18:53:06] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: http://api.jquery.com/load/ ?
[18:53:42] <fabianhjr> $('#result').load('index.html', function() {   ('#loading-image').hide(); }); ?
[18:54:08] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: yeah i saw that resource...that would be for loading an external source, no?
[18:55:13] <jahrichie> i should really just figure out how to use a loading gif for all images
[18:55:16] <jahrichie> even easier !
[18:55:38] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: yeah, you could also use it to load images.
[18:56:03] <fabianhjr> I mean, I prefer to be seeing stuff as it is available instead of waiting for a whole page to load.
[18:58:22] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: yeah
[18:58:22] <fabianhjr> $(window).hashchange( function(){ alert( location.hash );})
[18:58:23] <fabianhjr> $(window).hashchange();
[18:58:44] <jahrichie> i think all designers recommend against this
[18:58:50] <fabianhjr> How should I place those? It looks like if I put them inside 	$(document).ready(function() {
[18:58:50] <fabianhjr>  my whole thing stops working. D:
[18:59:23] <fabianhjr> I dunno know anything about conventions. Probably will learn them as I code.
[19:03:06] <abjorn> imsky: lolololol just had a 6 minute win in dominion
[19:03:10] <fabianhjr> http://pastebin.com/umz8rNvt Line 27 and 28 break my JS, any tips for isolating damage and actually fixing this?
[19:03:10] <abjorn> in LoL
[19:03:26] <imsky> abjorn: i dunno wat that means but congratz ma brotha
[19:03:38] <abjorn> it means complete and utter annihilation
[19:04:23] <imsky> oh for sho
[19:04:40] <thomedy> okay i have firefox catching my hotkeys however chrome is not
[19:04:43] <thomedy> ????
[19:04:52] <abjorn> well quit doin it wrong
[19:04:53] <abjorn> geez
[19:04:56] <botfather> hehe
[19:05:01] <thomedy> i have keypress set to b.which and b.keyCode
[19:05:06] <thomedy> so i thought i hadem all
[19:05:12] <botfather> targeting multiple platforms is difficult
[19:05:26] <thomedy> botfather was taht at me
[19:05:27] <thomedy> ?
[19:06:02] <botfather>        if (window.event) keycode = window.event.keyCode;
[19:06:02] <botfather>            else if (e) keycode = e.which;
[19:06:02] <botfather>         else return true;
[19:06:07] <botfather> thats what i use
[19:06:27] <abjorn> imsky: I had a customer say "java scripty" today
[19:06:44] <imsky> what context was it in?
[19:06:55] <abjorn> "i thought i didnt need any java scripty"
[19:07:08] <abjorn> he had a java applet that wasn't working on his server but worked on his local machine
[19:07:19] <imsky> lolol
[19:07:22] <abjorn> turned out the page was missing a javascript file that loaded the java applet
[19:07:26] <imsky> plz sir my jaboscripty
[19:08:36] <imsky> abjorn: caught your tweet about gentoo, what were you thinking?
[19:09:12] <abjorn> I was thinking that I was bored and wanted to see what all the hubbub was about
[19:09:15] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: figured out an elegant solution that doesn't hide anything! chyeaa.com
[19:09:21] <jahrichie> whee!
[19:09:26] <abjorn> turned out to be an utter waste of time
[19:09:36] <abjorn> coulda installed 10 ubuntus in the time it took me to install 1 gentoo
[19:09:47] <coldhead> but they wouldn't run as fast
[19:09:49] <imsky> abjorn: did you at least do it in a vm?
[19:10:00] <abjorn> of course
[19:10:00] <coldhead> funroll-loops forever
[19:10:05] <abjorn> rofl
[19:10:07] <abjorn> my friend at work
[19:10:12] <abjorn> showed me that after i told him about that
[19:10:24] <abjorn> I have never heard of it before
[19:10:34] <imsky> wat r ur cflags
[19:10:39] <abjorn> rofl
[19:10:40] <imsky> -O999
[19:10:41] <abjorn> i used
[19:10:43] <abjorn> the default
[19:11:34] <coldhead> get back to microsoft, default boy
[19:11:39] <coldhead> gentoo don't want you
[19:12:32] <fabianhjr> Any way of using CSS3 transitions to transition the change of content of a page? Like $("#cont").load('inicio.txt'); making a smooth transition?
[19:12:34] <jwm> heh
[19:12:45] <imsky> fabianhjr: nope
[19:12:47] <teamcoltra|work> I am using .hide to hide a div until an event is trigger... thats all fine and dandy... but I am also using javascript to put the expected text in the field that will disappear when clicked (Name: [Your Name Here]) ... but that doesn't show up after the div shows until it's clicked. Is there some function to stimulate that field?
[19:12:55] <jwm> been using gentoo for almost a decade now and I use defaults :)
[19:13:21] <jwm> well I have a bunch of use flags
[19:16:07] <teamcoltra|work> Does that even make sense?
[19:16:30] <fabianhjr> imsky: easy way to do it in <1 hours for a newb/
[19:16:39] <imsky> fabianhjr: wat
[19:17:33] <thetrav> I keep seeing examples that do ${function() { some code }) is this some sort of lazy evaluation, document on load thing?
[19:17:42] <abjorn> yes
[19:17:44] <abjorn> it's a shortcut
[19:18:25] <thetrav> if I have it multiple times in my script will one override the other? or are they queued up?
[19:18:27] <fabianhjr> imsky: animate the change of the content after a  $("#cont").load('inicio.txt'); ?
[19:18:41] <thetrav> thanks abjorn
[19:19:03] <abjorn> thetrav: well, they'll work like any other event callback, they queue up essentially
[19:19:06] <imsky> fabianhjr: how exactly do you want to animate it?
[19:19:27] <abjorn> thetrav: It's probably better to find a way to organize your code so you don't have a bunch of onload callbacks, but it's possible
[19:19:46] <fabianhjr> imsky: I got a nav menu that changes the content of a div. I want to make a smooth transition from one content to the next.
[19:20:03] <imsky> fabianhjr: how exactly?
[19:20:30] <thetrav> abjorn: doing a mashup, only some of it is my code, but thanks for the tip
[19:22:03] <teamcoltra|work> I am going to re-word (not trying to keep going ON and ON I just want to be clear): I am using http://files.myopera.com/micahrayaills/files/AutoSelectDeselect.html this technique mixed with http://api.jquery.com/show/ this technique... but after "show" the textbox doesn't have the helpful hint, until it is selected then deselected
[19:22:17] <teamcoltra|work> mikeric: nice to see a fellow BC person :)
[19:22:23] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: you tlaking about something like this ? http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex17/ajaxcontent.htm
[19:23:08] <fabianhjr> No, I am already doing that. I want an animation of ~1s showing the change of content.
[19:23:17] <abjorn> thetrav: It won't effect performance or anything, but for sanity sake it's nice to have just one onload
[19:23:27] <abjorn> easier to figure out what's going on when something goes wrong
[19:25:02] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: hmmm, i use thttp://pastebin.com/FKUwe4nM
[19:25:03] <jahrichie> http://pastebin.com/FKUwe4nM
[19:27:12] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: exactly! :D
[19:27:18] <jahrichie> whEEE
[19:27:38] <jahrichie> might want to quicken that time
[19:28:01] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: whacha working on?
[19:28:16] <fabianhjr> Dunno, I am trying to do the same for a div. hang on with me.
[19:28:27] <imsky> abjorn: i'm off man, laate
[19:29:12] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: a horrible ITC project which demanded me to use Dreamweaver, FRAMES and FRAMESETS, and horrible style properties with the, surprise, font tag.
[19:29:22] <fabianhjr> I mean, it is supposed to be atop notch school.
[19:29:29] <fabianhjr> What the hell am I doing with Frames?
[19:29:39] <fabianhjr> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4SKL7f9n58
[19:30:29] <fabianhjr> So I decided to go with hashtags, css3, and proper html5. All written by hand on Notepadd++, vim, or other.
[19:30:33] <fabianhjr> Fun overall.
[19:35:45] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: what school? and got a link?
[19:36:38] <tomasm-> hi, if i have a function i call on a selector that finds multiple items, will the function be called automatically in a loop fashion, or do I have to manually loop through it? if so, how do I loop through the items?
[19:39:21] <pifantastic> tomasm-: depends in what function you are calling
[19:40:07] <tomasm-> pifantastic, my own function i created.... j(this).length == 2 when im inside of it, so im guessing I need to call each() inside of the function if i anticipate multiple items
[19:40:32] <pifantastic> tomasm-: yes
[19:46:37] <fabianhjr> jahrichie: second got a snack. Back now.
[19:46:55] <fabianhjr> http://www.itesm.mx/
[19:47:30] <fabianhjr> I already broke into several servers and got the passwd and shadows.
[19:47:48] <fabianhjr> WonÂ´t do anything with them, I am just trying to help the school.
[19:48:12] <jahrichie> fabianhjr: grey hacking?
[19:48:15] <fabianhjr> However I would like to have better technology classes and a more knowledgeable staff.
[19:48:34] <fabianhjr> indeed, got about 2 years hacking.
[19:48:51] <jahrichie> where you located?
[19:49:03] <fabianhjr> I am just getting into web design. Just because of this overnight assignment.
[19:49:07] <fabianhjr> Mexico City.
[19:49:14] <jahrichie> true
[19:49:22] <fabianhjr> You will most likely find me in the next Campus Part.
[19:49:23] <jahrichie> what platform you use?
[19:49:25] <fabianhjr> party*
[19:49:39] <jahrichie> i'm up in nyc
[19:49:40] <jahrichie> haha
[19:49:47] <fabianhjr> Windows, Fedora, and Mac OSX Snow Leopard. I dislike Lion.
[19:49:52] <jahrichie> another large city but very far
[19:50:05] <fabianhjr> Damn, well, I am sure I will visit NYC again sometime in the next decade.
[19:50:30] <taitems> anyone familiar with "Cannot call method 'addClass' of undefined" on the jQuery UI slider?
[19:50:39] <fabianhjr> Not very far compared to alpha centaury. We have yet to stop the Vogons from building the intergalactic highway trough our solar system
[19:50:58] <taitems> it's really tough to set up a JSFiddle example, but i'm toggling enabled/disabled and somewhere between a tab change it cracks the shits
[19:55:29] <RedOrigin> how do you get table values with jquery?
[20:00:11] <jahrichie> RedOrigin: what do you  mean get, where's the source
[20:00:43] <dsdeiz> hi, say i got this http://jsfiddle.net/sncXa/ is there also a way to have .dialog stay shown when the mouse is over that element? and fadesOut when mouse leaves it?
[20:02:09] <jahrichie> dsdeiz: i'm confused, insnt that already happening?
[20:02:50] <RedOrigin> it's a wordpress site, so the source would be a post located in $wpdb->$post->the_permalink; I guess.
[20:03:44] <dsdeiz> jahrichie: nope. .dialog fades out when mouse it leaves #hover-here
[20:05:35] <RedOrigin> I'm trying to make it so that when you click on a thumbnail it loads content with the same array index into a container. It's easy to do if you load everything onto the page and only show one, but the thing I want loaded is a youtube video and I would have to load 20 which makes it take forever to load.
[20:06:39] <dsdeiz> jahrichie: need .dialog to stay shown when mouse hovers over to #hover-here and goes to .dialog
[20:07:24] <RedOrigin> so now I'm trying to figure out how to grab the same content with jquery directly from the table.
[20:08:09] <fabianhjr> I am trying to do $("#cont").fadeOut(1000); $("#cont").load(dest + '.txt'); $("#cont").fadeIn(500); However my content is destroyed on the fadeout, like if it does the load along with it. Any help on how to avoid this?
[20:08:49] <coldhead> ?load @ fabianhjr
[20:08:50] <bot-t> fabianhjr, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[20:08:53] <coldhead> use the callback
[20:08:58] <coldhead> ugh you suck bot-t
[20:09:01] <coldhead> ?ajax.load
[20:09:02] <bot-t> coldhead, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[20:09:10] <coldhead> that guy documents it ^^
[20:09:52] <fabianhjr> coldhead: I am a newb to JS or jQuery in general. So you say it executes all three statements at the same time?! Blasphemy.
[20:12:15] <ddoom> does anyone know of a plugin to replace alert() and confirm() that works just the same but is able to be styled?
[20:15:03] <fabianhjr> $("#cont").load(location.hash + '.txt'); Seems buggy, for some reason it load the same page inside of itself. So it loops only once inside a div. isnÂ´t location.hash something like Â¨#indexÂ¨?
[20:25:02] <fabianhjr> Well, good night.
[20:25:56] <abjorn> I instinctively want to end every "du" command in shell with "hast mich." It's a problem.
[20:31:08] <meltz> I'm using a jquery plugin for tooltips called "tipsy" and I'm having trouble getting it to work for live events
[20:31:16] <meltz> here is my question on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7857906/tipsy-jquery-plugin-for-dynamic-live-events-is-not-working
[20:31:47] <meltz> I followed the instructions in the docs but it doesn't seem to work
[20:33:47] <pifantastic> meltz: The docs seem to imply "live" just means if the title changes the tooltip will also change
[20:34:12] <pifantastic> Why cant you just call the plugin when your ajax callback executes?
[20:34:36] <coldhead> that's your solution to everything
[20:34:36] <pifantastic> on the new elements?
[20:34:46] <meltz> pifantastic: good idea
[20:34:53] <pifantastic> coldhead: I will report you for cyberbullying

[20:45:15] <abjorn> lol
[20:45:30] <abjorn> seems like something irc shouldn't allow lol
[20:45:38] <ryanneufeld> what is +b ?
[20:46:06] <abjorn> adding user mode b
[20:46:06] <abjorn> so
[20:46:07] <abjorn> banning
[20:46:09] <abjorn> that bans everyone
[20:46:10] <abjorn> ever
[20:46:29] <ryanneufeld> why would you do that?
[20:48:20] <pifantastic> ryanneufeld: don't test him
[20:48:32] <pifantastic> he may +b *!*@* us all
[20:48:34] <ryanneufeld> Why? Does he get test anxiety?
[20:48:42] <botfather> no dont do that ;]
[20:48:42] <vmasto> Hello guys, I'm trying out various Ajax stuff while learning jQuery, and I need some advice. Here's the thing that troubles me: I've made 4 dropdowns and every dropdown gets updated depending on the values of its previous sibling dropdowns. Code is here http://jsfiddle.net/eGB98/1/ and it works. I was wondering, isn't there a better way to write this, probably handle all four with just one function? Any ideas or pointers?
[20:48:56] <botfather> its the only activity in my irssi at this hour ;]
[20:49:35] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: yeah there is a better way
[20:49:45] <vmasto> ryanneufeld: ?
[20:49:48] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: learn how to use the data parameter
[20:50:07] <vmasto> the Ajax response?
[20:50:18] <abjorn> ill do it
[20:50:19] <abjorn> ILL DO IT
[20:50:24] <abjorn> except i cant do it here
[20:50:25] <ryanneufeld> ?$.ajax @vmasto
[20:50:26] <bot-t> vmasto, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:50:36] <abjorn> but i totes could in #vidyadev
[20:51:12] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: instead of using load, use ajax. Then you can pass your prams as a data object instead of those fugly get strings you're building
[20:52:00] <coldhead> SHARKS! SHARKS!
[20:52:14] <vmasto> ryanneufeld: Yes duly noted, actually my original script uses $.ajax. I was more interested not in the method that gets the data as the general abstraction of the navigation handling, how could I handle all 4 dropdowns in a single function? How would you approach it?
[20:52:24] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[20:52:26] <abjorn> coldhead you should setmode +b *!*@*
[20:52:39] <ryanneufeld> GREETINGS FELLOW REPUBLICANS
[20:52:41] <ryanneufeld> SHIT
[20:52:44] <coldhead> hahahha
[20:52:46] <ryanneufeld> WRONG RELIGION
[20:52:57] <ryanneufeld> ROFL
[20:53:06] <ryanneufeld> it's funnier cause I'm from Canaidia
[20:53:19] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: well, I think there is a better way
[20:53:27] <pifantastic> ?g finite state machine @ vmasto
[20:53:28] <bot-t> vmasto, Finite-state machine - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine
[20:53:31] <href>     var child = $(this).children(":last"); <- this isnt selecting the last child
[20:53:51] <abjorn> >fellow republicans
[20:53:51] <abjorn> >wrong religion
[20:53:51] <abjorn> so many joeks all packd in one
[20:54:00] <href> how come?
[20:54:35] <vmasto> Do I really need to handle each dropdown's change event in a different function, or is there a way to handle all of them in one?
[20:55:47] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: you can handle them all inone
[20:55:56] <ryanneufeld> and us the id property
[20:56:02] <ryanneufeld> to figure out which one to deal with
[20:56:15] <vmasto> using cases?
[20:56:17] <ryanneufeld> but having separate functions for each would be more maintainable
[20:56:22] <ryanneufeld> that's one way
[20:56:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[20:57:26] <vmasto> I'm just trying to get a grasp on the best practice here. So you're saying that there's nothing really wrong for having separate functions for each one right?
[20:57:36] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/eGB98/2/
[20:58:00] <ryanneufeld> first off, is your php returning HTML?
[20:58:43] <ryanneufeld> I personally would recommend not doing it that way, as you're UI is then bound to that end point, and if you want to change to using spans or ul/li later
[20:58:54] <ryanneufeld> then you need to fuck with back end code
[20:59:05] <vmasto> I know I know
[20:59:09] <vmasto> It's using JSON
[20:59:09] <ryanneufeld> I would return JSON (php has json_encode()  look it up)
[20:59:18] <vmasto> I just wrote it that way so the example would be clearer
[20:59:23] <vmasto> :D
[20:59:27] <ryanneufeld> well, it's not
[20:59:34] <ryanneufeld> it makes you look like you know less than you do
[20:59:39] <ryanneufeld> paste your real code
[20:59:44] <ryanneufeld> then I can better help you
[21:02:32] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: what I would do is write a function that takes json object or an array, and applies it to a select element by adding the options
[21:02:56] <vmasto> for each dropdown separately?
[21:03:17] <ryanneufeld> the function would only work with one select
[21:03:29] <vmasto> so X amount of dropdowns X amount of functions
[21:03:33] <ryanneufeld> no
[21:03:44] <ryanneufeld> one function to update a select
[21:03:54] <ryanneufeld> you pass it an id, and the options you want
[21:03:58] <ryanneufeld> and updates it
[21:04:12] <ryanneufeld> then you reuse that function when you want update anyone of them by calling it
[21:04:13] <vmasto> aha!
[21:04:22] <ryanneufeld> ?DRY
[21:04:23] <bot-t> DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. http://goo.gl/xwCA
[21:04:38] <vmasto> yes that's more like what I'm asking
[21:04:38] <vmasto> :D
[21:05:02] <ryanneufeld> I would bind to the change on each select individually mself
[21:05:07] <abjorn> rip john mccarthy btw
[21:05:11] <ryanneufeld> ++
[21:05:41] <abjorn> so many tech peeps dyin
[21:05:43] <abjorn> guess im next
[21:05:58] <ryanneufeld> I wanna be the keith richards of coding
[21:06:06] <ryanneufeld> I'm never dead, but I should be
[21:06:10] <vmasto> yes, so one updateSelect() function and then $selectEl.bind("change", updateSelect(vars) );
[21:06:12] <abjorn> roflmao
[21:06:12] <ryanneufeld> and I'm always awesome
[21:06:13] <vmasto> something like that aye?
[21:06:23] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: no
[21:06:31] <vmasto> dammit I'm such a noob
[21:06:38] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: gimme 10mins
[21:06:47] <abjorn> vmasto: everyone is at some point
[21:06:49] <ryanneufeld> and I'll whip up a small example for you, k?
[21:06:53] <vmasto> okie!
[21:06:59] <clir-in> pifantastic: thank you.
[21:07:05] <ryanneufeld> you're trying, and you're not being a dick about asking for help, so... yeah
[21:07:06] <ryanneufeld> lol
[21:07:36] <vmasto> my main problem is that I don't have a classical programming training, I know the tools and methods but I have no idea on programming patterns and always trying to ask experienced people about best practices
[21:07:40] <vmasto> :}
[21:08:02] <clir-in> but i cant make it work. is this correct? $('#abc').datepicker('setDate', '+1d'); ?
[21:20:08] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/eGB98/3/
[21:20:24] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: sorry, 13mins
[21:20:37] <vmasto> :D
[21:20:49] <ryanneufeld> I simplified it
[21:20:58] <ryanneufeld> but I think you can see what I was going for
[21:21:26] <ryanneufeld> also, you need to use 'var' when you're delcaring variables, or else they become global, and that's bad.
[21:22:59] <vmasto> thanks for this ryanneufeld mind if I ask some questions?
[21:23:21] <ryanneufeld> <sarcasm>YES</sarcasm>
[21:23:28] <vmasto> :P
[21:23:45] <vmasto> so I'll need one $selectDropdown.bind('change', function() { for each dropdown
[21:23:53] <vmasto> if I understand correctly
[21:24:16] <ryanneufeld> This is just my opinion, but for now yes
[21:24:36] <vmasto> okay, abotu the variable thing, if I don't use globals
[21:24:42] <ryanneufeld> there is a more 'compact' method, but it's not as easy to maintain
[21:24:57] <vmasto> how can I pass the sport value to the country select for example?
[21:25:23] <ryanneufeld> ah, see, when you use var, it makes it function scope
[21:25:23] <vmasto> re-select it inside that anonymous change event callback function?
[21:26:05] <ryanneufeld> you're caching (good job on that btw) the selectors (which you used classes when you had ids, so I changed that too, cause ids are faster and only one)
[21:26:18] <ryanneufeld> in the document ready scope
[21:26:24] <vmasto> aye
[21:26:26] <ryanneufeld> which means any function created with in it
[21:26:34] <ryanneufeld> can see it's variables
[21:26:55] <vmasto> aha, so I just pass $selectSport.val()
[21:27:19] <ryanneufeld> here's the fun bit
[21:27:24] <ryanneufeld> in the change handler
[21:27:31] <ryanneufeld> the value of this
[21:27:36] <ryanneufeld> is the select itself
[21:27:40] <ryanneufeld> so if you look at what I did
[21:27:45] <ryanneufeld> var that = $(this)
[21:27:52] <vmasto> yes you cached the $(this) object
[21:27:54] <ryanneufeld> I cached a copy of the jquery wrapped element
[21:28:01] <vmasto> so that you can use it inside the ajax callback function
[21:28:01] <vmasto> :D
[21:28:02] <ryanneufeld> right, so then in the callback
[21:28:05] <ryanneufeld> I can use that
[21:28:21] <ryanneufeld> cause in the callback, this is not the select, it's a different this
[21:28:30] <vmasto> aye!
[21:28:34] <ryanneufeld> ?scope
[21:28:35] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, jQuery.proxy() - Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular scope. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[21:28:45] <ryanneufeld> not what I was looking for
[21:28:49] <josh99> i use jquery-json. is there a replacement to this library in jquery itself?
[21:28:52] <vmasto> :P
[21:28:54] <ryanneufeld> anyone have a good article on js scope?
[21:29:27] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: http://robertnyman.com/2008/10/09/explaining-javascript-scope-and-closures/
[21:30:05] <ryanneufeld> josh99: jquery support s json if that's what you are asking
[21:30:18] <vmasto> so for example, to populate the 3rd dropdown that needs 2 variables (sport + country) I need to be passing the country value like so :            data: {  'sport-select': that.val(), 'country-select': $selectCountry.val() }
[21:30:20] <vmasto> right?
[21:30:38] <ryanneufeld> well, no
[21:30:45] <vmasto> :o
[21:31:00] <ryanneufeld> how can we do this nicely...
[21:31:00] <vmasto> yes sorry
[21:31:03] <vmasto> other way around
[21:31:04] <vmasto> LOL
[21:31:06] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[21:31:07] <vmasto> sorry
[21:31:12] <vmasto> it's 7:30am here :P
[21:31:26] <ryanneufeld> where is "here"
[21:31:29] <vmasto> Greece
[21:31:46] <vmasto> 'sport-select': $selectSport.val(), 'country-select": that.val()
[21:31:47] <vmasto> right?
[21:32:24] <ryanneufeld> yes
[21:32:30] <vmasto> thanks dude!
[21:32:31] <ryanneufeld> that will work
[21:32:40] <josh99> ryanneufeld: how would u do that in jquery? http://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/
[21:32:47] <vmasto> uhm.. if you ever need any Photoshop advice hit me up :D
[21:32:48] <vmasto> :P

[21:36:13] <coldhead> waitm you guys are two different ryans?
[21:36:23] <coldhead> WHICH ONE HAVE I BEEN CYBERING?!
[21:36:27] <ryanneufeld> Me
[21:36:30] <coldhead> apologies to the other ryan then
[21:36:33] <ryanneufeld> lol
[21:36:40] <coldhead> damn you tab completion!
[21:36:45] <ryanneufeld> indeed
[21:36:51] <coldhead> i did think sometimes you just weren't into it
[21:37:02] <ryanneufeld> sometimes i'm not
[21:37:12] <ryanneufeld> but I play along cause I'm bored and feel sorry for you
[21:37:16] <coldhead> oh, so i /was/ right to send flowers
[21:37:25] <coldhead> just tell me next time, baby
[21:37:26] <ryanneufeld> absofuckingloutely
[21:37:36] <ryanneufeld> your mom loved them
[21:37:49] <syosoft1> anyone know a non-hacky way to add a param to a URL opened w/ colorbox?
[21:37:53] <coldhead> you laid them on her grave?
[21:37:59] <ryanneufeld> yes
[21:38:02] <coldhead> that's nice of you
[21:38:08] <ryanneufeld> I'm a nice guy
[21:38:22] <josh99> ryanneufeld: what is the equivalent of $.evalJSON(encoded) ?
[21:38:35] <ryanneufeld> josh99: no idea
[21:38:51] <ryanneufeld> I've never used that library, nor do I have any clue what it does
[21:39:02] <ryanneufeld> syosoft1: define non-hacky
[21:39:52] <syosoft1> something in the definition...i just saw data?
[21:40:09] <syosoft1> .colorobox({data:{colorbox:'true'}}); ?
[21:40:16] <ryanneufeld> oh, yeah
[21:40:21] <ryanneufeld> don't use colorbox
[21:40:24] <ryanneufeld> it's terrible
[21:40:32] <syosoft1> er, or use href, hah.
[21:42:30] <ryanneufeld> vmasto: you sorted?
[21:44:32] <josh99> it seems like the way to convert object into json string is jquery-json plugin. if anyone has other idea, let me know.
[21:45:09] <ryanneufeld> josh99: what's the purpose of doing so?
[21:49:44] <josh99> ryanneufeld: not sure. i am working on a codebase that requires it
[21:50:19] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[21:50:23] <ryanneufeld> I've never heard of it
[22:54:46] <dwarder> i'm using this widget http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ is it possible to call a function upon widget 'close'
[22:55:02] <dwarder> widget 'done'
[22:55:04] <dwarder> *
[22:55:27] <dwarder> i.e. close the widget with the 'done' button
[22:57:02] <dwarder> i cant figure out how
[23:04:35] <dwarder> can anyone help me with this widget http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ i need to run a function upon clicking the 'done' button
[23:06:49] <Eviltwin> dwarder: Look at example 15
[23:08:26] <dwarder> Eviltwin: thanks, i missed that, btw you counted from the top =) ?
[23:08:36] <dwarder> i mean, you counted?
[23:08:39] <dwarder> ;)
[23:08:47] <Eviltwin> $('#example15').datetimepicker(...
[23:09:09] <dwarder> damn, i guess i'm too sleepy
[23:09:16] <dwarder> Eviltwin: thanks again :)
[23:09:42] <dwarder> thanks a lot
[23:09:48] <Eviltwin> No problem
[23:09:49] <coldhead> i'm too clammy
[23:13:50] <dwarder> hmm, onSelect is not what i want ...
[23:14:04] <Eviltwin> So not doing something when they select a date?
[23:15:34] <dwarder> Eviltwin: the even is just executed and executed
[23:16:13] <dwarder> right after i've refreshed the page with the new code
[23:16:27] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle?
[23:16:51] <dwarder> i will try
[23:23:59] <dwarder> Eviltwin: well, right now i'm stuck there http://jsfiddle.net/tzqHQ/4/ widget doesn't want to show up
[23:27:11] <dwarder> Eviltwin: works with $('#example1').datepicker(); thoguth ... default ui widget
[23:27:23] <dwarder> though*
[23:27:56] <Eviltwin> Wrong order
[23:27:58] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/tzqHQ/5/
[23:29:15] <dwarder> ohh i see, now to my function ....
[23:31:30] <duellsy> how do I use jQuery() form inside content that has been loaded via .ajax() ?
[23:33:41] <Eviltwin> duellsy: Do you know how to use $.ajax success?
[23:34:58] <duellsy> Eviltwin don't think I can, I have a login box that is loaded into a modal window via an ajax call (this same ajax call is used for loading various forms etc into the modal box) and on load, I'd like to focus the cursor in the username field
[23:35:15] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle?
[23:35:22] <Eviltwin> That illustrates the problem
[23:36:26] <dwarder> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/dnszf/1/
[23:36:49] <Eviltwin> dwarder: Notice any differences between the example and what you're doing?
[23:36:53] <dwarder> oops
[23:37:05] <dwarder> Eviltwin: this one http://jsfiddle.net/dnszf/2/
[23:37:15] <dwarder> Eviltwin: it is just runs upon page load
[23:37:22] <dwarder> Eviltwin: this onSelect event
[23:37:47] <Eviltwin> I know it does
[23:37:54] <Eviltwin> I know why it does
[23:38:02] <Eviltwin> I'm hoping you can see the difference
[23:40:20] <duellsy> tried... but ajax wont work on jsfiddle... http://jsfiddle.net/vq3Fu/
[23:40:33] <dwarder> Eviltwin: here i used 'inline' function and it doesn't work as it need to, http://jsfiddle.net/hXJk5/
[23:40:50] <dwarder> Eviltwin: the even is fired upon input field change,
[23:40:52] <Eviltwin> duellsy: After you do the .html(), then do your .focus
[23:40:57] <duellsy> at least you can see the jquery in there, and just imaging that the content being loaded into the modal box via ajax is a form that has a username and password
[23:41:04] <dwarder> Eviltwin: not after i've clicked 'done' button
[23:41:16] <dwarder> event*
[23:41:40] <Eviltwin> As far as I can tell, the library doesn't actually support binding to the Done button
[23:41:44] <Eviltwin> At least not directly
[23:43:16] <dwarder> Eviltwin: what are other ways?
[23:43:23] <duellsy> Eviltwin: I can't in there though, as that piece of code is used on quite a lot of modal boxes, most of which won't have the field to focus on
[23:43:43] <duellsy> i.e., the create account form is loaded through that same form, as it confirmations to delete items etc
[23:43:49] <duellsy> *as is
[23:44:23] <duellsy> so the .focus() needs to be inside the page that is getting ajaxed in... but that page doesn't know about jquery
[23:44:56] <Eviltwin> You might be able to do a $(".ui-datepicker-close").live("click",function(){/*handler for any done timepicker button*/});
[23:46:00] <dwarder> let me fiddle this
[23:47:56] <duellsy> this is the closest similar issue I can find > http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3402027/triggering-onload-behavior-in-ajax-return-data
[23:48:56] <Eviltwin> Then follow it?
[23:49:24] <dwarder> Eviltwin: this live thingie is working but unfortunately i have two widgets on my page, one of which doesn't need that handler
[23:49:54] <duellsy> all it says is that the issue has been resolved... which from my testing, it hasn't
[23:50:48] <dwarder> Eviltwin: i can pass an even to the function and find out which is called?
[23:50:52] <dwarder> event*
[23:51:03] <dwarder> from withing the function?
[23:51:13] <Eviltwin> dwarder: You can make that selector more specific
[23:51:34] <Eviltwin> $("#container-for-the-one-i-care-about-but-not-the-other .ui-datepicker-close").live(...
[23:51:49] <dwarder> Eviltwin: ohh, that is great
[23:51:54] <dwarder> Eviltwin: thank you, a lot
[23:52:28] <dwarder> could have found out this last thing by myself, too sleepy atm
[23:52:49] <Eviltwin> Well I just came up with it
[23:52:52] <Eviltwin> I didn't look it up anywhere
[23:53:33] <karstenk1977_> moin
[23:55:27] <dwarder> Eviltwin: and it doesn't work for some reason ... http://jsfiddle.net/RBLRJ/
[23:58:47] <dwarder> i guess the widget is on its own and is absolutely positioned ...
[23:58:52] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[23:58:55] <Eviltwin> Just noticed taht
[23:58:56] <Eviltwin> that*
