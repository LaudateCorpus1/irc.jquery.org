[00:33:16] <derekZero_> Guys... guys... I have a CSS hover transition inside a jQuery animate queue, and for some reason, after the transition it teleports 10000px to the right! Madness...
[00:40:45] <Uhkis> thanks for the info!

[01:35:33] <BustyLoli-Chan> can anyone tell me when this page loads, will it call that function and then ever second afterwards? or will it wait a second and then call that function?
[01:35:43] <BustyLoli-Chan> *every second
[01:51:29] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a height() or innerHeight() that doesn't take padding
[01:51:33] <zizzl> into the equation
[01:53:22] <zizzl> Woops

[05:00:21] <anli> Is it possible to get the non-computed margin-top for a h1? .css will use computed styles
[05:00:36] <anli> I need original units
[05:01:05] <Cork> anli: well if you set it inline in the h1 element you can get it with attr
[05:01:25] <Cork> but ya, .css uses the computed cause it is the only way it can always get the value
[05:01:26] <anli> Yes, but unfortunately, the value comes from a css file
[05:01:49] <Cork> ya, so you can't get the none computed value unless you walk the entire document.styleSheets list
[05:02:02] <anli> ok
[06:33:34] <Sagar> How can we post fields and image via ajax together with validation?
[06:44:38] <walidvb> hey all
[06:45:45] <walidvb> i'm fetching some content via ajax, stripping out the <script> tags, and appending them to body. there are 2 scripts: the twitter js file(remote), and the twitter conversion code(inline).
[06:46:56] <walidvb> the problem is that the 2nd script is run before the first one. (the 1st modifies the twttr object with twttr.conversion, and the 2nd calls twttr.conversion.trackPid, which doesn't exist when run)...
[06:47:01] <Sagar> Hello, this is my script, how can push to check file selected and then post it with fields. Thanks http://jsfiddle.net/smdofd5n/5/
[06:58:39] <walidvb> short example: https://jsfiddle.net/afffsjob/
[07:38:44] <Sagar> anyone on?
[08:22:54] <taplar> i love soda day
[09:04:09] <MikeD_> https://api.jquery.com/promise/  type default = "fx"  <-- what are the other types?
[09:04:36] <Cork> MikeD_: it is just a string, it can be anything
[09:04:58] <Cork> fx is what is used by the javascript animations
[09:05:43] <Cork> (it is the names from the queue system)
[09:06:52] <MikeD_> so how would it be used in some other context?  I'm only newly familiar with Deferred  .promise()
[09:07:18] <Cork> .promise() is for hooking into the jquery queue system
[09:07:32] <Cork> if you just want deferred you should look at $.Deferred() instead
[09:08:11] <Cork> the queue is what is used to trigger the next animation when you queue animations on an element
[09:08:38] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[09:10:00] <MikeD_> i didn't know what was even a thing :)
[09:10:47] <Cork> it is what makes ex. $('selector').slideUp().slideDown() work
[09:14:00] <MikeD_> so my mistake was thinking https://api.jquery.com/promise/ was the same as http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[09:14:13] <MikeD_> they're similar, but used for different purpose
[09:16:06] <muranjan> Hi I have a business requirement when user provide his address then I need to send him mail with a google map for that address.. I tried google map API for geolocation and it is working but how will I create that mail using javascript not sure.. please help me...
[09:16:47] <MikeD_> muranjan: you need a serverside mail application
[09:17:20] <MikeD_> then you make a muranjan crazymail API that your web page can call :)
[09:18:15] <muranjan> MikeD_: yeaa I have mail function but javascript mail need to transfer into php mail body..
[09:18:54] <muranjan> MikeD_:google map api create Map in a a div using callback..
[09:21:55] <muranjan> any idea??
[10:03:01] <JyZyXEL> $(".thumb").click(function() { $(".thumb:hover").attr("class", "thumb"); $(this).attr("class", "thumb:hover"); });
[10:03:18] <JyZyXEL> why don't my thumbnail classes never reset after clicking them?
[10:03:19] <Cork> don't modify class with attr >_<
[10:03:33] <JyZyXEL> what should i use?
[10:03:33] <Cork> class is for class names not class rules
[10:03:41] <Cork> the css resource
[10:03:44] <Cork> not jquery
[10:04:09] <JyZyXEL> i only want the currently clicked thumbnail to have the "thumb:hover" class
[10:05:34] <V\i\c\t\o\r\C\L> JyZyXEL
[10:06:04] <V\i\c\t\o\r\C\L> $(".thumb").click(function() {  $("this").addClass("thumb-hover"); });
[10:06:07] <V\i\c\t\o\r\C\L> something like that
[10:06:25] <Cork> JyZyXEL: :hover is a psudo class
[10:06:33] <Cork> it isn't a class you can add and remove on the element
[10:08:26] <caz> Hello
[10:09:05] <caz> I'm trying to get data attribute of a stored element, could anyone help me?
[10:09:29] <caz> I tried : mainElementId.find('[data-pinned="false"]') but this does not work
[10:10:05] <momomo> anyone here care to help  out with css transitions? i believe the experts are in here :P it's pretty straightforward what I am after, and it's pretty near: See this: http://jsbin.com/luzorumoge/1/edit?html,css,output
[10:10:13] <momomo> It's a full working example
[10:10:36] <Cork> caz: is pinned sat as an attribute or through .data() ?
[10:10:43] <JyZyXEL> V\i\c\t\o\r\C\L: but it already has class?
[10:10:44] <momomo> What I would like to do is that on the last set timeout get it to slide up again .. but I can only do the animation once only  ...
[10:10:51] <momomo> i need to reset it somehow
[10:11:22] <JyZyXEL> $(this).attr("class", "thumb:hover");
[10:11:24] <JyZyXEL> that works
[10:11:46] <Cork> JyZyXEL: you mean you have a .thumb\:hover {} in your css?
[10:11:52] <JyZyXEL> yeah
[10:11:55] <Cork> why?!?
[10:11:56] <caz> Cork: It's set primarily as attribute on DOM then updated by code
[10:12:02] <JyZyXEL> Cork: to get hovers
[10:12:06] <Cork> no
[10:12:14] <Cork> that would be .thumb:hover
[10:12:19] <Cork> and that isn one class
[10:12:23] <JyZyXEL> thats what i have
[10:12:28] <Cork> it is the class .thumb + the psudo class :hover
[10:12:35] <Cork> the later can't be controlled through the element
[10:12:42] <JyZyXEL> .thumb {} and .thumb:hover {}
[10:12:55] <Cork> ya, and the later isn't a class you can add to an element
[10:13:00] <JyZyXEL> oh
[10:13:16] <Cork> simplest way to get around that if you feel you need to
[10:13:22] <JyZyXEL> so i should add another class for highlighted thumbs
[10:13:31] <Cork> is to do .thumb {} .thumb:hover, .thumb.hover {}
[10:13:43] <Cork> then just do .addClass('hover') on the element
[10:13:48] <Cork> and later .removeClass('hover')
[10:16:16] <JyZyXEL> nothing happens :\
[10:16:37] <JyZyXEL> shouldn't it be changeClass?
[10:16:54] <JyZyXEL> because the class is normally set to just .thumb
[10:17:00] <caz> Nope, you should keep the thumb class on the item
[10:17:15] <caz> You have to handle the addClass and removeClass on Jquery side
[10:17:26] <caz> browser hover won't handle this
[10:18:29] <caz> Cork: Data is filled initially on DOM, then updated by Jq later
[10:19:19] <JyZyXEL> caz: but now im defining .thumb:hover and .thumb.hover
[10:19:26] <JyZyXEL> and they have the same contents
[10:19:35] <JyZyXEL> so its replicated code
[10:19:49] <JyZyXEL> no way around that?
[10:20:41] <caz> Yes, you could do : .thumb:hover, .thumb.hover {CSS code}
[10:21:02] <JyZyXEL> ah!
[10:23:22] <fas3r> Hello
[10:29:26] <MikeD_> isn't the use of programmatically assigning a "hover" class when you aren't actually hovering the pointer a weird UX?
[10:30:01] <MikeD_> if the purpose is to re-implement :active, then just use :active - eh?
[10:30:45] <MikeD_> otherwise, make a meaningful class name that provides some clue what is going on in that state
[10:30:57] <MikeD_> </preach>
[10:37:09] <jrockjiggz> Hi, i have <tr> where i want to group them by <tr class="group"> until the next <tr class="group">.. any ideas?
[10:42:06] <MikeD_> jrockjiggz: tbody ?
[10:43:47] <caz> How can I get elements that have data-attributes to certain value (both initialized by DOM and modified by script) ?
[10:44:54] <MikeD_> caz: [data-foo=bar] ?
[10:45:59] <caz> When I update the data-attribute by code, this does not work anymore
[10:46:33] <caz> And when having already an element stored in variable, I can only use filter to get the element
[10:46:43] <MikeD_> make a jsfiddle.net example?
[10:46:51] <caz> Okay
[10:47:46] <caz> I'll try that
[10:48:57] <Es0teric> has anyone here used underscorejs?
[10:48:58] <MikeD_> mostly because this is the kind of thing were we could end up talking past each other for the next 2 hours, or in 15-20 minutes you have a working code example to share
[10:49:52] <caz> I know MikeD_ I'm used of code sharing over IRC
[10:55:23] <jrockjiggz> i think i got it, i just need to drop the last item in my selection.. not sure how
[10:55:27] <caraconan> Hi there. This is the right way to catch same event for 2 different selectors? http://paste.debian.net/317295/ Thanks
[10:55:33] <jrockjiggz> how do I drop the last item selected
[10:56:01] <caz> MikeD_: Just for information, how could I do .data on element stored in var ?
[10:56:13] <Es0teric> has anyone here tried to integrate a underscorejs template with something like selectizejs?
[10:56:28] <Es0teric> i am trying to figure out why selectizejs is not triggering inside of the underscorejs template
[10:59:32] <AdamPDotty> caraconan: looks wrong, probably '#bookmark, #bookmark-2'
[11:00:33] <caraconan> AdamPDotty: thanks, I will give it a try
[11:04:16] <caraconan> AdamPDotty: it does'nt works. I can't believe that there's no way to pass a list of CSS selectors. Should I duplicate code then?
[11:04:40] <MikeD_> caz: $( .. ).data('foo","bar")  ?
[11:08:22] <caz> MikeD_: that doesn't set the value?
[11:09:06] <taplar> caz: it should, though there is a typo in it
[11:09:20] <caz> I suppose I can't get elements that matches to a specific data-attribute value
[11:09:34] <caz> After these data-attributes are updated by code
[11:09:34] <taplar> sure, just write a custom find/filter
[11:09:41] <caz> Hmm
[11:09:48] <caz> I'll try then
[11:10:00] <Es0teric> has anyone here tried to integrate a underscorejs template with something like selectizejs? i am trying to figure out why selectizejs is not triggering inside of the underscorejs template
[11:10:45] <taplar> caraconan: what do you have that is not working for you?
[11:11:05] <caz> But filter / find doesn't allow .data method but only css selector [data-thing=val
[11:11:27] <taplar> right, which is why you'd make a custom one providing the function to perform the match
[11:11:49] <taplar> $(selector).find(function(){ return (true if whatever matches); });
[11:12:07] <caz> Ok taplar, I'll get a look on this
[11:12:29] <caraconan> taplar: it just catches the latest selector, not the 1st one....
[11:13:10] <taplar> are you saying it does not fire for the first one, but does the second one?
[11:13:51] <saransh__> Hi, I am facing a little issue with owl carousel
[11:19:12] <km4> hi, why this not work http://jsfiddle.net/59o3sest/ ? simple onclick ?
[11:20:14] <caraconan> taplar: confirmed: it just picks the last selector provided in the list
[11:20:27] <taplar> caraconan: http://jsfiddle.net/9u7b03kw/
[11:20:40] <Es0teric> does anyone here know how to include external js libraries into an underscorejs template?
[11:24:28] <caraconan> taplar: I'm not sure if it's relevant, but using jquery mobile and cordova... Apparently ['#one', '#two'] does the trick...
[11:24:45] <taplar> huh
[11:30:27] <caraconan> taplar: the [] syntax is not working. Anyway many thanks
[11:34:16] <taplar> km4: looks like it is failing because the function does not exist yet when the html is rendered.  bind in the javascript instead.  it's a better practice anyway.
[11:40:28] <km4> taplar: already have it :) thnx
[11:40:37] <taplar> cool
[11:41:59] <caz> ok I got it working taplar, but in the case I have multiple elements that have data-attribute and I want to return them, does it work? I didn't got it : https://jsfiddle.net/Lp85ra23/
[11:42:50] <taplar> uh, data items from static html would be strings
[11:43:08] <taplar> so you should quote them and string compare
[11:44:51] <caz> It's not about data-attributes loaded by DOM, but modified by code
[11:45:03] <caz> Did you try the fiddle?
[11:45:14] <caz> Pinned items should unpin on clic
[11:45:17] <caz> click
[11:45:22] <taplar> i'm looking at it.  i just saw the data tags in the html
[11:46:30] <caz> It's updated on the pinItem and unpinItems
[11:46:46] <esaym> hmm how to select something with 2 classes? like <div class="class1 class2"></div> ? I though $('.class1 .class2') would do it be not working ...
[11:47:02] <taplar> esaym: no space between the classes
[11:47:15] <taplar> '.class1 .class2' <-- or
[11:47:19] <taplar> '.class1.class2' <-- and
[11:47:30] <taplar> err sorry
[11:47:34] <taplar> '.class1 .class2' <-- nesting
[11:47:42] <esaym> taplar: I thought '.class1, .class2' was the OR? (note comma)
[11:47:52] <esaym> hmm, ok
[11:48:15] * esaym adds that to notes without testing first
[11:48:27] <taplar> caz: so what was your question about your logic again?  sorry
[11:48:53] <caz> When pinning an item, It should unpin all the other pinned items (in my fiddle)
[11:49:19] <caz> Right now when trying to select multiple elements with filter on data-attributes, it always returns me an empty array
[11:50:36] <caz> taplar: see the unpinItems function that should do the trick
[11:54:11] <taplar> caz: ah, your setting the data after you do the finder on the .pinned
[11:54:20] <taplar> so it's setting the data on that, not the original element
[11:54:23] <NoiseEee> sup turds
[11:55:08] <JyZyXEL> how do i prevent my thumbnail viewer from resetting to default picture when i press browser refresh?
[11:56:19] <caz> Hmm
[11:56:22] <taplar> JyZyXEL: possibly some application of localStorage to remember the last displayed picture
[11:56:57] <taplar> !g javascript localStorage
[11:57:13] * Calinou just got spermabanned from #web
[11:57:27] <caz> That's right, my bad...
[11:57:45] <JyZyXEL> taplar: maybe i could just put it in the url?
[11:58:03] <JyZyXEL> or i guess that doesn't work with jquery being client based?
[11:58:07] <taplar> JyZyXEL: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[11:59:03] <Soltis> Is there syntax to run a given selector over only a given DOM fragment?
[11:59:43] <taplar> Soltis: just do it on the fragment
[11:59:49] <taplar> it's the same otherwise
[11:59:55] <Es0teric> how do i grab a class and just update that one classes attribute without the dom making a duplicate of it?
[11:59:56] <Soltis> taplar: What's the syntax for that?
[12:00:13] <taplar> $(fragment).find() or $(fragment).filter()
[12:00:51] <Soltis> taplar: So $(frag).filter(selector).each(...); is the same as $(selector) except only applied to frag ?
[12:01:11] <taplar> Es0teric: what do you mean it's making a duplicate?
[12:01:39] <Es0teric> taplar i cant make a fiddle yet, i can only show you the raw code on pastebin
[12:01:51] <JyZyXEL> taplar: this is what i have now: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/572eb9b4/
[12:01:53] <Soltis> taplar: And if so, would there be a speed penalty for, e.g., doing $(body_fragment).filter(selector).each(....) vs $(selector).each(...) ?
[12:02:11] <Es0teric> taplar http://pastebin.com/7Q7Y0V6p
[12:02:23] <Soltis> taplar: I've got something that I want to run on the entire doc, but later rerun on new DOM subtrees before they're added to the page. Having one syntax for both cases would be much simpler.
[12:02:26] <Es0teric> taplar line 9
[12:02:31] <taplar> Soltis: find() searches for nested children of the element.  filter() searches the current results for matches.
[12:02:46] <Soltis> taplar: I see.
[12:02:53] <Es0teric> i want to append a newly created input field into whatever matches the id of the value i am targeting
[12:02:55] <Soltis> taplar: So I'd presumably want find(selector) insetad
[12:02:58] <Soltis> instead*
[12:03:07] <taplar> for children, yes
[12:03:09] <Es0teric> BUT i only want it to update the value of its position in the hidden input
[12:03:52] <Soltis> taplar: And if I wanted to simply grab every matching element within fragment--the top level container element or any children alike--is there syntax for that?
[12:03:55] <taplar> Es0teric: line 11 is creating a new input
[12:04:14] <Es0teric> taplar yes i am aware
[12:04:28] <taplar> Soltis: find() does that, if done off of the fragment
[12:04:43] <Soltis> taplar: Okay. And the other question about performance/behaviour?
[12:05:04] <taplar> i missed that, let me look back
[12:05:23] <taplar> oh
[12:05:46] <taplar> filters are faster, provided that your going to be reusing the parent
[12:05:57] <Soltis> taplar: Not necessarily.
[12:05:58] <taplar> otherwise a find would be fine
[12:06:33] <Es0teric> taplar ok so basically i want to append a new input field on the parent when a button is clicked or when the sortable updates.. but when the sortable updates, i dont want it to create a new hidden input field -- i want it to update the current hidden field that is there
[12:06:40] <JyZyXEL> var image = $(this).attr("rel"); localStorage.lastImage = image;
[12:06:42] <JyZyXEL> is that correct?
[12:06:46] <Soltis> taplar: I've got a page that loads more (relatively arbitrary) content dynamically; I'd like to do the same munging I did to the original entire page, to the new content, before adding it.
[12:06:49] <Es0teric> the parent in this case would be the target var
[12:07:10] <Soltis> taplar: So it's either $.parseHTML(new_content) or $('body') in the first case
[12:07:33] <Soltis> taplar: Let me shoot that phrasing and try again.
[12:07:49] <taplar> JyZyXEL: you have to use setItem()
[12:07:57] <taplar> JyZyXEL: look at that documentation i linked
[12:09:10] <JyZyXEL> ok so: localStorage.setItem('lastImage', image); and then i use if (localStorage.lastImage) { }
[12:09:16] <Soltis> taplar: Originally I need to do something equivalent to $(someselector).each(....);  later on I get a new string of arbitrary HTML (yes, the design sucks--I didn't write this) that gets constructed and appended with $.parseHTML/append()--and I want to do the same operations on that fragment. If I can make a single function using the same syntax where fragment is the entire doc OR just the new content, it's a lot less code.
[12:09:22] <taplar> localStorate.getItem(key)
[12:09:27] <taplar> localStorage
[12:10:29] <taplar> Es0teric: ok, so to make sure i'm understanding.  you want to create one if it's not there, but if it is, just update it
[12:10:46] <Es0teric> taplar bingo
[12:10:59] <taplar> Es0teric: so first try to find it and if the .length is 0, create it
[12:11:58] <Es0teric> taplar so then target.find('.sectionPos').length should be fine rihgt?
[12:12:01] <Es0teric> right
[12:12:16] <taplar> the syntax is correct
[12:12:26] <taplar> provided target is a jquery object
[12:12:36] <Es0teric> taplar it is
[12:13:02] <JyZyXEL> taplar: but when i try to click an image, the code gets execute that changes the image back
[12:13:13] <JyZyXEL> so i cannot change images anymore
[12:13:47] <JyZyXEL> can i somehow have code that only gets executed when browser refreshes or something?
[12:14:33] <taplar> JyZyXEL: the logic you had to begin with would for the most part stay the same.  the only thing would be a new extra piece that happens when the page loads to either change it back to what it was before they refreshed, or whatever logic you have to initialize it would need to check to see if that key is set in localstorage and if it is, use that.  if not, do whatever the default is
[12:14:39] <fas3r> hello, with post ( ajax ) can I send an array / object as data ? for example $.post .... ,{ "name" : "brian" , "data", myarray }  where myarray is an array/object.
[12:14:55] <Soltis> taplar: Did that make *any* sense?
[12:15:27] <taplar> heh, sorry, i'm trying to keep different convos on track.  may miss some, sorry.
[12:15:52] <JyZyXEL> taplar: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/967944d4/ i thought that was pretty much it
[12:16:01] <JyZyXEL> but now i cannot change pictures anymore
[12:16:11] <taplar> Soltis: ok, so your saying at the start you have many pieces.  your looping through each piece and doing something to them.  then later, you get a new piece, and you want to do the same logic to them
[12:16:44] <JyZyXEL> ahhh, used wrong variable
[12:17:50] <Soltis> taplar: I guess that's one way to put it. Right now, there is a function that is applied to the entire page via $(....).each(...). If I can change the syntax of that to e.g. $(fragment).filter(...).each(...) and then have fragment either refer to the entire document (on page load) or a new fragment (when adding more content) . . . well, you get the idea. I hope.
[12:18:41] <taplar> fas3r: yes you can give post an object for data.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ <-- look down under Examples
[12:18:54] <JyZyXEL> how do i empty my localstorage?
[12:19:21] <taplar> JyZyXEL: I believe there is a removeItem(key)
[12:19:28] <JyZyXEL> but in the browser
[12:20:01] <taplar> clearing cache may do that?  i'm not entirely sure on that though
[12:20:23] <taplar> if you want the data to be invalid once the user closes the browser you can use sessionStorage rather than localStorage
[12:21:26] <taplar> Soltis: yeah that would make logical sense, to have a function that processes each of the pieces and in your loop to send it each piece, and later on when you get a new one you can just give that function the new piece
[12:21:39] <fas3r> taplar, yes you talk about serialize or ArraySerialize probably
[12:21:50] <Soltis> taplar: Okay. As long as there isn't some horrible cost to feeding the entire document through that function, I think I'm good. Thanks.
[12:22:15] <taplar> Soltis: you wouldn't send the entire document, just the pieces
[12:22:31] <JyZyXEL> is it possible to select the <div> that contains the <img> with certain src0?
[12:22:49] <NoiseEee> yes
[12:22:56] <NoiseEee> the same way as you'd search for any attribute value
[12:23:18] <taplar> Soltis: $('body').find('pieceSelector').each(function(){ processPiece($(this)); });
[12:23:27] <taplar> or something of that manner
[12:23:53] <JyZyXEL> do i just use $('imagename.png').stuff
[12:24:11] <JyZyXEL> that probably doesn't select the div
[12:25:22] <JyZyXEL> does the $() actually have some sort of documentation i could look at?
[12:25:32] <JyZyXEL> i assume that is the thing that selects things
[12:26:02] <taplar> JyZyXEL: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[12:30:23] <theskillwithin> I'm trying to understand this still https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[12:30:26] <amikrop> $('#someid').on('hover', '.someclass', function () { alert('foo'); });  // doesn't work, any ideas why?
[12:36:38] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/ and http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/mystery-jquery-object-syntax-basic-introduction/
[12:45:25] <JyZyXEL> NoiseEee: $(src:localStorage.getItem('lastImage')).addClass("hover");
[12:46:56] <JyZyXEL> but i need the <div> that is housing <img src=localStorage.getItem('lastImage')>
[12:47:54] <JyZyXEL> does jquery have anything for that?
[12:54:19] <JyZyXEL> $("<div>(.*)"+image+"(.*)").addClass("hover");
[12:54:23] <JyZyXEL> shouldn't that work?
[12:55:37] <JyZyXEL> nothing seems to work
[12:55:58] <NoiseEee> yeah, you'd have to actually take the time to learn the syntax or hire someone to do it for you <shrug>
[12:56:19] <fas3r> is it better to use map or each ?
[12:56:31] <JyZyXEL> is it even possible to get nested stuff like that?
[12:56:38] <NoiseEee> your first mission is to find the <img> tag you are looking for; the links I provided should give you info on how to find an <img> with a particular src.  After that, you can look for the parent <div> @ JyZyXEL
[12:57:14] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: is it possible to get what you're after in a one-liner?  doubtfully
[12:57:24] <NoiseEee> at least not one that you or anyone else would easily understand
[12:57:29] <JyZyXEL> yeah i found the "img[src="+image+"]"
[12:58:07] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: okay, once you have that in a jquery object, you can look at https://api.jquery.com/closest/ to find the parent you're after.
[12:58:07] <JyZyXEL> perhaps i should just put more information in the localstore
[12:58:27] <NoiseEee> just separate your stuff into individual tasks JyZyXEL
[12:58:37] <taplar_eating> fas3r: it depends on what your trying to achieve.  they serve different purposes
[12:59:59] <JyZyXEL> NoiseEee: $('img[src='+image+']').closest('div').addClass("hover");
[13:01:11] <JyZyXEL> actually  $('img[src="'+image+'"]').closest('div').addClass("hover");
[13:01:54] <JyZyXEL> .parent('div') is maybe better
[13:01:56] <NoiseEee> great JyZyXEL
[13:01:58] <NoiseEee> well done.
[13:02:00] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/umwkopck/ @ JyZyXEL
[13:02:20] <NoiseEee> OKAY BLUE JAYS MFERS
[13:02:30] <JyZyXEL> is there a way to debug why it doesn't work?
[13:02:47] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com
[13:02:52] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 in general
[13:03:23] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: or try to recreate it on jsfiddle - as you can see, that selector DOES work.  perhaps a) you have the wrong img variable  b) you don't have a .hover CSS defined, etc etc
[13:05:00] <JyZyXEL> NoiseEee: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/961ae532/
[13:05:25] <NoiseEee> thats not a fiddle, i'll leave you to debug that JyZyXEL
[13:05:53] <NoiseEee> do your functions even run?  learn/use the "debugger" statement and your console.
[13:06:40] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: there are so many places that code could go wrong.  did localStorage "getItem" even succeed?  did it return an actual image? etc etc
[13:08:12] <JyZyXEL> well yeah i don't have a development environment
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> you have a browser.
[13:08:22] <JyZyXEL> just a text editor and firefox
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> firefox has a dev environment in it.
[13:08:37] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com shows you how to use it.
[13:10:25] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: you can't be a successful programmer that way.
[13:10:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:10:32] <NoiseEee> you need to use your console at least
[13:10:39] <NoiseEee> but a text editor is just silly
[13:10:47] <robertmaxrees> get sublime or even just np++
[13:10:53] <NoiseEee> at least one that doesn't have syntax highlighting etc
[13:10:54] <JyZyXEL> im using KWrite
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not meant for writing code.
[13:11:22] <JyZyXEL> has syntax hilight
[13:11:25] <robertmaxrees> oh looks like it sort of is.
[13:11:31] <robertmaxrees> does it support autocomplete?
[13:11:37] <NoiseEee> well, at the very least learn how to use your browser debug console
[13:11:39] <JyZyXEL> i guess it does
[13:12:02] <robertmaxrees> either way, use your browser's dev tools
[13:12:07] <NoiseEee> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools is a nice intro for Chrome
[13:12:27] <JyZyXEL> browser debug console is full of errors about totally unralted thing
[13:12:32] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[13:12:37] <NoiseEee> here's the version for FF https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> those can be totally related to why your code might not work ;)
[13:12:41] <JyZyXEL> extensions and plugins and other sites javascript
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> that can break your code, JyZyXEL
[13:13:24] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: well a) what robertmaxrees said - you might actually want to investigate that stuff, but also b) you can still use it for your own specific purposes
[13:14:27] <JyZyXEL> window.controllers is deprecated. Do not use it for UA detection.
[13:14:35] <JyZyXEL> thats the only message my site generates
[13:14:39] <JyZyXEL> in the console
[13:14:43] <JyZyXEL> so it should be all good
[13:14:45] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL are there any other errors in your console?
[13:14:49] <JyZyXEL> nope
[13:15:01] <robertmaxrees> so that's the ONLY error that you get when you reload your page?
[13:15:04] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: okay, well use 'debugger' in your code and halt the code mid-execution to debug why stuff isn't working
[13:15:17] <NoiseEee> JyZyXEL: you're going to have to take time to learn how to debug if you want to program <shrug>
[13:15:36] <robertmaxrees> you spend far more time debugging/fixing things than you do actually writing code.
[13:16:35] <theskillwithin> I'm trying to understand this still https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[13:16:36] <JyZyXEL> Expected ':' but found '}'.  Declaration dropped.
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin what about it do you need to know?
[13:16:56] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL that'll break things.
[13:16:59] <JyZyXEL> that is right after: GET
[13:17:01] <JyZyXEL> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js
[13:17:09] <theskillwithin> robertmaxrees how to implement in my code, how it can benefit me
[13:17:12] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL that means you're calling it with some bad stuff.
[13:17:27] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin do you have a need to modify function context right now?
[13:17:38] <theskillwithin> no,
[13:17:42] <theskillwithin> but when would I  need to?
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> you know how sometimes you might do something like var $this = $(this); so you can keep that element reference around?
[13:18:28] <robertmaxrees> or you do var that = this; ?
[13:19:46] <theskillwithin> ahh
[13:20:07] <theskillwithin> could it help with like, see how i have a lot of functions that do the same thing just on different elements http://pastie.org/10498100
[13:20:19] <theskillwithin> maybe I c ould learn how to write a function that writes functions haha or something to make it neater
[13:20:57] <taplar> that looks like just a case that you could generalize more
[13:21:27] <theskillwithin> hmmm howso?
[13:21:40] <taplar> each one of those elements, your finding the child '.subuldiv' and toggling it
[13:21:53] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin $.proxy() is specifically for setting context.
[13:22:15] <JyZyXEL> and here i was thinking i could simply make a picture selector easily :D
[13:22:58] <taplar> also, if there are multiple of those classes, that logic may be flawed anyway
[13:23:16] <taplar> as your doing the parent lookup in the handler
[13:24:08] <dimi1947> do you know of any good jquery plugin about page transitions that has also good support?
[13:24:31] <JyZyXEL> haha, the example jquery gallery scripts also have this same bug
[13:24:36] <theskillwithin> ahh so i can just do .subuldiv > div  or something to select all the children,  then use $(this) to make it work
[13:24:42] <JyZyXEL> when you refresh it goes back to the default image
[13:25:08] <JyZyXEL> no wonder im having trouble making it remember the position if even experienced programmers cannot make it work
[13:25:20] <taplar> theskillwithin: http://jsfiddle.net/y4kf8ue3/
[13:25:33] <taplar> if you gave them all a shared class then the selector could be shorter
[13:25:47] <theskillwithin> haha nice!
[13:25:51] <theskillwithin> thanks taplar
[13:26:15] <taplar> you see the difference in the function body?
[13:26:22] <theskillwithin> yea
[13:26:35] <taplar> and understand how the other could be a logic flaw?
[13:26:38] <JyZyXEL> can i echo variable somehow that i see them?
[13:26:41] <theskillwithin> ya
[13:26:45] <taplar> k, :)
[13:26:46] <theskillwithin> I  need to start using find more often
[13:26:54] <robertmaxrees> JyZyXEL we linked you to the page that explains all of that.
[13:27:06] <JyZyXEL> i have 30583 pages open
[13:27:18] <robertmaxrees> bummer :(
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a good read.
[13:27:58] <JyZyXEL> robertmaxrees: the site only has a picture
[13:28:05] <JyZyXEL> of a yelling kid
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> right the right arrow on your keyboard.
[13:28:22] <JyZyXEL> oh..
[13:28:40] <JyZyXEL> well last time i just closed the tab because i thought there was nothing but the picture
[13:28:58] <robertmaxrees> not sure why we'd keep linking you to that page if that's all it was, but okay :)
[13:30:08] <JyZyXEL> window.alert() was awesome help
[13:30:18] <robertmaxrees> it tells you to not use it ;)
[13:30:18] <JyZyXEL> wrong filename :D
[13:30:21] <robertmaxrees> console.log() is your new friend.
[13:30:34] <theskillwithin> for life
[13:30:39] <taplar> lol
[13:30:43] <JyZyXEL> the console just crashed my firefox
[13:30:54] <JyZyXEL> i don't like it
[13:30:54] <theskillwithin> and his cousin var_dump  you might meet someday
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:31:04] <robertmaxrees> then you need to fix your copy of ff.
[13:31:10] <robertmaxrees> because, as the page explains, window.alert("Is Not A Debugger");
[13:31:15] <JyZyXEL> haha, that is never going to happen
[13:31:32] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want to be a programmer?
[13:31:42] <JyZyXEL> not for firefox
[13:31:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't get to choose which browsers you're going to support ;)
[13:32:02] <taplar> unless your intranet
[13:32:06] <taplar> *dances*
[13:32:11] <robertmaxrees> then you'
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> *you're being lazy ;)
[13:32:34] <taplar> *pushes up his glasses and does nerd voice* I prefer the term 'focused'
[13:32:59] <taplar> but yeah we support multiple
[13:33:06] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[13:33:39] <theskillwithin> On my sites if you use IE it doesn't display anything and just says Go away
[13:33:45] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:33:53] <theskillwithin> I don't want a client who uses IE
[13:34:03] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want to support a lot of the internet.
[13:34:08] <theskillwithin> also I  am kidding, but I  don't support anything under IE 11 if I  don't have to
[13:34:19] <theskillwithin> flexbox is here
[13:34:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:34:41] <robertmaxrees> every time i hear somebody complain about supporting old IE i just kind of laugh
[13:34:45] <robertmaxrees> it's not that hard these days.
[13:34:52] <robertmaxrees> progressively enhance and call it a day.
[13:41:28] <JyZyXEL> console.log("hello");
[13:41:34] <JyZyXEL> am i supposed to see that somewhere?
[13:41:47] <robertmaxrees> in your console
[13:41:53] <JyZyXEL> oh its in the "Logging" tab
[13:41:58] <JyZyXEL> not in the "JS" tab
[13:44:17] <JyZyXEL> Object { length: 0, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument → index.html, selector: "div[rel='5d.png']" } index.html:43:16
[13:44:24] <JyZyXEL> can i check if the selector actually matched?
[13:44:30] <robertmaxrees> see the .length up there?
[13:44:37] <robertmaxrees> that means it didn't.
[13:44:39] <JyZyXEL> oh yeah, it did not match
[13:44:45] <JyZyXEL> <div class="thumb"><a href="#" rel="5d.png" class="galRef"><img src="5ds.png" /></a><div>5 Days</div></div>
[13:44:48] <robertmaxrees> you can do $('anyselector').length and test.
[13:44:49] <JyZyXEL> why did it not match that?
[13:45:04] <JyZyXEL> oh yeah, its <a>'s rel=
[13:45:06] <taplar> the rel is on the a, not the div
[13:46:12] <JyZyXEL> finally! :)
[13:46:43] <JyZyXEL> $("a[rel='"+image+"']").parent().addClass("hover");
[13:46:46] <robertmaxrees> ew
[13:46:52] <robertmaxrees> .filter() that instead.
[13:47:54] <JyZyXEL> it wouldn't make any difference?
[13:47:59] <JyZyXEL> this only matches 1 item
[13:48:08] <robertmaxrees> it's working really hard to get that one item.
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> .filter() will speed that up a bit.  otherwise, at least try to "scope" it down a bit by finding a relevant parent element and then .find() off of that.
[13:49:38] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors are kind of gross because they're not really very efficient, and they're hard to read.
[13:50:02] <JyZyXEL> attribute selector is the only one that works here
[13:50:11] <robertmaxrees> .filter() would work, too.
[13:50:55] <JyZyXEL> Description: Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector
[13:51:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:51:06] <JyZyXEL> my matches elements is 1
[13:51:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:51:16] <JyZyXEL> its not?
[13:51:18] <robertmaxrees> you'd start with $('a') instead.
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> and then .filter() from there.
[13:51:48] <JyZyXEL> oh
[13:52:17] <JyZyXEL> counterintuitive that, that would be faster
[13:52:26] <robertmaxrees> not counterintuitive at all.
[13:53:06] <robertmaxrees> $() uses sizzle which is great for compatibility, but not good at filtering through things./
[13:53:09] <JyZyXEL> filter takes a selector though
[13:53:15] <robertmaxrees> give it tags, classes, and IDs.
[13:53:22] <robertmaxrees> filter() is working at a different level than $()
[13:53:30] <JyZyXEL> the only selector you could give it would be a a[rel=... selector
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> right, the way .filter() does its work is very different from the way $() does its
[13:53:57] <robertmaxrees> *does its work
[13:54:40] <robertmaxrees> feel free to use the non-filter version all you want, just encouraging you to get into good habits early.
[13:55:00] <JyZyXEL> robertmaxrees: so you are saying to use: $('a').filter($("a[rel='"+image+"']")).parent().addClass("hover"); ?
[13:55:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> $('a').filter("[rel='"+image+"']").parent().addClass("hover");
[13:56:47] <JyZyXEL> well, it does not do much to improve readability?
[13:58:20] <JyZyXEL> robertmaxrees: ahhhh, you gave the selector string to filter(), not the actual selector itself
[13:59:26] <robertmaxrees> the string IS the selector.
[13:59:48] <JyZyXEL> oh, i thought 'selector' meant a selector-object
[13:59:54] <robertmaxrees> no such thing.
[13:59:59] <robertmaxrees> $() returns a jquery object.
[14:00:20] <robertmaxrees> well, depending on what you feed it.  normally, you give it a selector, which is a specially formatted string.
[14:00:33] <theskillwithin> no one can figure this out.  I  purchase subscription to this but I  want to scrape the videos so I c an watch them on my TV.  anyone know how to scrape these? https://www.americastestkitchen.com/episode/472-baguettes-at-home?ref=Episode_feature_1
[14:01:14] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin it's an iframe.
[14:01:39] <robertmaxrees> with a video tag.
[14:01:52] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple stuff.
[14:03:28] <bondibox> Is anyone familiar with the PragProg depot app not showing the cart items when adding the first item? I think the workaround is to force the page to reload, so I'm trying something that looks like this
[14:03:29] <bondibox> if ($('#cart tr').length == 1) { $('#cart').show('blind', 1000); } {$(window.location.reload(true))}
[14:04:08] <robertmaxrees> bondibox the whatnow?
[14:04:16] <theskillwithin> robertmaxrees the video is transfered in a ton of fragments, I  can't' find a way to download it
[14:04:26] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin i found a single mp4 file.
[14:04:33] <bondibox> Pragmatic Bookshelf's depot application for rails
[14:05:06] <theskillwithin> whaaa?
[14:05:07] <robertmaxrees> bondibox dunno then.
[14:08:59] <bondibox> I just wan to force the page reload when the #cart css table row is populated. The first part unhides the div, and I'm trying to jury rig the second part, the page reload.
[14:09:17] <bondibox> I'm probably just not stringing the multiple functions together properly
[14:09:26] <robertmaxrees> bind an event listener to things that add to the cart then.
[14:09:34] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you want to reload the page, but that's an option.
[14:10:00] <bondibox> great breadcrumbs, thanks
[14:10:13] <theskillwithin> robertmaxrees what is this single mp4 file url?
[14:10:33] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin it's inside the iframe.
[14:10:54] <boner> I have a $('#main'), and i want to find the parent that has   *_section as a tag, any ideas
[14:11:06] <robertmaxrees> what is *_section ?
[14:11:12] <boner> different tab
[14:11:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:11:25] <robertmaxrees> is that a class?  id?
[14:11:37] <boner> id="address_section"  ... id="name_section"
[14:11:40] <boner> that kind of idea
[14:11:57] <robertmaxrees> .closest() with an attribute contains selector i guess.
[14:12:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd give those a class.
[14:12:06] <robertmaxrees> of .section
[14:12:19] <taplar> how does #main relate to those sections?
[14:12:28] <boner> #main is a table
[14:12:55] <robertmaxrees> do you have multiple #main on this page?
[14:12:59] <taplar> ^
[14:13:14] <boner> no, i am moving it between tabs.  Detaching it
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove it fwiw.
[14:14:01] <boner> i want to detach it,  set the tbody to be empty and then attach it on another tab
[14:14:09] <boner> why do i need to remove it?
[14:14:16] <robertmaxrees> why are you making the document work so hard?
[14:14:29] <boner> because dragtable messes up
[14:14:43] <robertmaxrees> but if you're just shuffling it around, then you want .closest() and to give a class to those parent elements to select on.
[14:15:01] <boner> i will do that, thank you
[14:16:34] <JyZyXEL> these slides on http://fixingthesejquery.com are really good
[14:16:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:23:37] <sdegutis> Does set.map() auto-concatenate the results when you return an array for each item in the set?
[14:23:46] <sdegutis> (By set I mean a jQuery collection.)
[14:24:10] <taplar> it returns an array
[14:24:27] <taplar> well, a jquery object containing the array
[14:24:41] <lemonhead> hello
[14:25:56] <sdegutis> taplar: Right, but if my map function returns an array per item, shouldn't the map function return an array of arrays?
[14:26:09] <taplar> yep
[14:26:18] <sdegutis> I'm seeing it return a gigantic array, as if it auto-concatenated or flattened my arrays.
[14:27:21] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[14:28:16] <dimi1947> do you know any good page transitions plugin...with good support also
[14:30:54] <sdegutis> taplar: var tuples = $('.something').filter(...).map(function() { return [$(this).data('a'), $(this).data('b')] });
[14:31:53] <taplar> and what do you see if you console.log( tuples ); ?
[14:32:22] <sdegutis> A giant array of all the a's and b's in order, flattened.
[14:33:40] <sdegutis> taplar: and JSON.stringify(result) confirms it, by returning an object with keys like "0", "1", "2", etc where the values are the values I'm describing, in order.
[14:33:45] <sdegutis> Which makes me think it's not really an array.
[14:34:28] <sdegutis> And results.toArray() fixes the object problem, but they're still a giant flattened array of all my map results.
[14:34:33] <thinkxl> sdegutis long time no see
[14:34:45] <sdegutis> thinkxl: so true
[14:35:34] <thinkxl> you in front-end development now?
[14:35:40] <sdegutis> Never stopped being in it.
[14:36:20] <sdegutis> taplar: oh wow, duh, it's actually right here: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/
[14:36:30] <sdegutis> The function to process each item against. The first argument to the function is the array item, the second argument is the index in array The function can return any value. A returned array will be flattened into the resulting array. Within the function, this refers to the global (window) object.
[14:36:36] <sdegutis> A returned array will be flattened into the resulting array.
[14:36:43] <sdegutis> heh, how did I not see that the first 3 times?
[14:37:21] <taplar> hmm
[14:37:27] <taplar> well ok, :)
[14:37:33] <sdegutis> So yeah, the solution is just [[]]
[14:37:36] <sdegutis> welp.
[14:38:35] <taplar> or an object if that would work
[14:48:17] <sdegutis> taplar: i see
[15:05:48] <jojobeans> anyone have an idea on what the best way would be to dynamically make a product list without using a database
[15:06:06] <jojobeans> i'm looking at about 15 products with about 10 attributes a piece
[15:06:31] <jojobeans> should i store the data in a JSON file and pull from that?
[15:07:18] <roger> How do you assign multiple events like: $('#start').on('click enterKey', function() { //do this});
[15:07:28] <roger> It seems like enterKey isn't working
[15:07:48] <taplar> enterKey is not a standard event i don't believe
[15:08:02] <taplar> that syntax is correct though
[15:08:03] <roger> taplar:  is there a way to do this in one line?
[15:08:55] <taplar> what tag is #start?
[15:08:59] <roger> i guess i can do click and keyup and check the event.keyCode
[15:09:07] <roger> just an id='start"
[15:09:22] <taplar> input, div, table, button... ?
[15:09:31] <roger> i actually have:
[15:09:48] <roger>  $('.overlay-menu .create').click()... Wanted to me that so it worked with enter too
[15:09:57] <roger> class on a dib.
[15:09:58] <roger> div*
[15:10:16] <taplar> so .create is a div?
[15:10:33] <roger> yea
[15:10:36] <roger> a class on a dib.
[15:10:37] <roger> div*
[15:10:53] <taplar> i'm not sure a key event would fire on a div
[15:11:19] <roger> yea it seems like keyup doesn't fire
[15:11:30] <taplar> yeah key events are mainly for inputs
[15:11:36] <taplar> of whatever flavor
[15:14:36] <roger> taplar:  cool thanks for the tips I just duplicated the code for now.
[15:14:43] <taplar> jojobeans: you could do that.  if you wanted you could have your frontend hit an endpoint to get that information and have that endpoint return the json.  so that if you ever in the future decide you do want to use a database, you would only have to change your backend
[15:16:08] <jojobeans> awesome, i'll keep working on it
[15:16:56] <jojobeans> i read somewhere that jQuery can't make calls to files stored locally
[15:17:11] <roger> Is there a jquery function i can call to escape html/javascript before data is saved?
[15:17:25] <jojobeans> so If i have my JSON data in a different file (data.json) that it wouldn't be able to make a call unless you do a workaround
[15:17:46] <roger> Or I guess I'm looking for a nodejs function I can call which can be called on the server to do that.
[15:18:01] <roger> and also on the client too for now.
[15:18:23] <taplar> javascript has encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent you could use
[15:19:43] <taplar> jojobeans: what do you mean stored locally?
[15:20:11] <jojobeans> on the same server
[15:20:29] <taplar> i would imagine you should be able to get it with a get request
[15:21:06] <jojobeans> gotcha, I just caught a glimpse of that when I was reading through some stuff on stackoverflow
[15:21:48] <taplar> they may have been meaning trying to do an ajax request to like file:///C:/.../myfile.txt
[15:22:07] <roger> taplar:  I'm wondering how do i protect against a user entering something like <!--
[15:22:08] <boner> i want to detach the inner html, and not the wrapping div.  Any idea
[15:22:27] <roger> Do i want to use encodeURIComponent for that?
[15:22:51] <taplar> roger: encoding would just make it so that it doesn't do anything.  it would still appear as text
[15:23:12] <taplar> roger: if you want to not let them enter that, then that's another kind of validation
[15:23:54] <taplar> boner: is the inner html text or is it child nodes?
[15:26:39] <roger> taplar:  using encodeURIcompoent will display it as %3C!-- instead of <!--
[15:27:17] <taplar> so i guess, what are you trying to do?
[15:29:23] <roger> taplar:  I have  a form that users can enter stuff in and then I display it to the screen.
[15:29:43] <boner> taplar, instead of removing the matching element and the content, i just want to remove the content ..
[15:30:17] <taplar> boner: define content.  what kind of content?
[15:30:30] <roger> but the problem is i display it in many places and the code that does the display does: $().append("<html> " + output...<..>.."> So I guess I'd need to wrap things with text or something.
[15:30:37] <taplar> boner: if it's nodes you can do $(parentSelector).children().detach()
[15:30:50] <boner> but that returns an array, no?
[15:31:01] <taplar> boner: if it's just text then you really don't detach, you just set it to blank
[15:31:09] <roger> I was thinking as long as i escape everything before I save it that will be the easiest thing to do.
[15:31:35] <taplar> roger: ok, so you want to display text without it trying to render it
[15:31:48] <roger> yup
[15:33:34] <taplar> roger: http://jsfiddle.net/x08gj4z0/
[15:34:12] <taplar> text() will escape it for you
[15:38:55] <roger> taplar: thanks, is there a way to use text() on the saved data so do not have to use it here?
[15:39:56] <roger> var data  =  text("<!--"); $(".preview').append("html....code" + data)
[15:40:03] <roger> something like that?
[15:46:34] <taplar> i know there has to be a function to do this built in, but i'm forgetting it  http://jsfiddle.net/x08gj4z0/1/
[15:48:15] <roger> thanks taplar let me try this out :)
[16:01:05] <taplar> roger: probably safer to just create a dummy variable to do the escaping with http://jsfiddle.net/x08gj4z0/2/
[16:02:05] <taplar> but i'm out.  time to head to the hizzy!
[16:47:04] <AlanL> I've paired the html to as basic as I can, but still getting the same thing:
[16:47:17] <AlanL> <!doctype html>  <html lang="en"> 	<head> 		<title>Test</title> 		<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>  	</head>  	<body> 		TEST 	</body> </html>
[16:47:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[16:47:29] <AlanL> Thoughts?
[16:47:58] <robertmaxrees> AlanL what's the problem?
[16:48:14] <AlanL> I'm getting "Array.prototype.slice: 'this' is not a javascript object"
[16:48:31] <robertmaxrees> with just what you've pasted above?
[16:49:01] <AlanL> that's correct Robert.. ( I'm seeing it with the developer tools turned on
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't sound right at all.
[16:50:21] <robertmaxrees> how are you loading that?
[16:50:28] <robertmaxrees> and if you check page source, is that accurate?
[16:52:05] <AlanL> I'm opening in the browser with the http://<server>/filename. It shows the "test" text, but only after running past the error.
[16:52:52] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure the server isn't caching anything?  that you're editing the correct file?  that your browser isn't caching anything?
[16:52:56] <AlanL> yes - it shows the same code when I do a "view source"
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> something about that seems way off.  what browser?
[16:54:16] <AlanL> I change the text from "TEST" to TEST1" and the TEST1 shows after refresh, so it's not cached.
[16:54:21] <AlanL> IE 11
[16:54:57] <AlanL> Dang - I didn't realize it was so late.. gotta run. I'll be back.
[17:28:40] <boner> how do you handle multiple ajax requests coming back with data in unexpected order.  Lets say someone clicks, generates an ajax request and then clicks again..  The second one populates before the first, and then the first comes and overwrites the second...  What's the proper way to do this?
[17:28:48] <robertmaxrees> deferreds.
[17:35:02] <robertmaxrees> and/or cancelling things.
[17:35:15] <robertmaxrees> and/or preventing the second click while the first call is running.
[17:35:17] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways.
[21:47:07] <ahandy> Hello :D I fetch an ajax request that gives me a random amount of divs, I need to split those divs equally in height to cover the whole window height, so basically 100/div.length %, but depending on the number of divs, it's not always 100% (in case number isn't perfectly divisible). Can someone offer a solution for that?
[21:48:57] <snover> what are you actually trying to do?
[21:49:24] <ahandy> Sec lemme jsfiddle it
[21:55:41] <ahandy> snover: https://jsfiddle.net/3tbyhrdo/ this basically
[21:55:50] <ahandy> snover: sometimes in between the divs, theres a thin white line
[21:56:14] <snover> no, sir, you are telling me how you are trying to implement something. what is the thing you are trying to do?
[21:57:12] <ahandy> snover: I have a set of absolute-positioned divs that I want to have equal in height & spread horizontally over each other across the screen
[21:57:19] <ahandy> snover: to cover the whole height of the screen
[21:57:43] <snover> stop talking about divs. divs are an implementation detail. what are you trying to *do*?
[21:58:07] <ahandy> That is what I'm trying to do :/
[21:58:08] <ahandy> I don't understand
[21:58:13] <ahandy> How do you want me to explain it to you
[21:58:40] <snover> are you trying to create a pseudo-gradient? do you have a bunch of data you are trying to lay out in a grid? are you making a bar graph?
[21:59:08] <ahandy> Have a bunch of banner-like images that I want to randomly spread out on a screen horizontally to give a "random" composition
[21:59:10] <ahandy> of the images themselves
[22:00:29] <ahandy> snover: is that what you wanted ot know?
[22:01:38] <snover> yes, though this thing is distributing equally so i am a little confused about the random part :)
[22:02:24] <ahandy> It's a random amount of things to distribute, so I don't know if I have to distribute 20 images, or 10 images
[22:02:31] <ahandy> Just basically have to dynamically calculate their height & position
[22:03:33] <snover> ok. so the best options are probably to use a table layout (not table elements, table layout) or flexbox layout and let the browser do that for you
[22:04:17] <snover> that will guarantee that no rounding errors are introduced in the rendering
[22:07:36] <ahandy> snover: page is now bugging when I made it into a table
[22:07:43] <ahandy> snover: just freezing, white page completely
[22:07:55] <ahandy> snover: and can't even right click anywhere, and laptop fan going crazy lol
[22:11:16] <snover> ahandy: https://jsfiddle.net/3tbyhrdo/2/
