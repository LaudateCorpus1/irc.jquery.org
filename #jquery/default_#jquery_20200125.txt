[01:40:06] <Darten> Hello everyone...
[01:40:39] <Darten> I’m not new to web, I’m not new to reading a little jquery either...
[01:41:11] <Darten> I looked up this api doc url:  https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[01:41:31] <Darten> ...and I was so chocked that I had the urge to talk to someone.
[01:41:36] <Darten> *shocked
[01:42:45] <Darten> the very first example on that page suggests concatting literal html snippests with data.
[01:43:52] <Darten> ... i.e. no proper quoting, just hoping the data is “good enough” to be handled as is.
[01:44:24] <Darten>     items.push( "<li id='" + key + "'>" + val + "</li>" );
[01:44:33] <Darten> My question:
[01:45:37] <Darten> Is that the way you work with jquery? Is that what the authors had in mind when programming jquery or is this just a totally embarrassing example?
[02:57:42] <Darten> anyone?
[03:08:24] <Uhkis> you might wanna start with explaining what's wrong with it according to you
[03:14:13] <Darten> oh...
[03:14:53] <Darten> well... if key contains ' or if val contains <li> the code is hosed.
[03:17:18] <Uhkis> the json is right under there
[03:17:57] <Darten> well, it would work with the json given, but it should always work
[03:18:03] <Uhkis> the point of that example is to show how the callback function is used, not how data should be handled
[03:18:08] <Darten> otherwise I need no script at all, if it is static...
[03:18:40] <Darten> so would you agree it is a bad example, because it teaches bad data handling?
[03:25:23] <Darten> I don’t ask this question for nitpicking.
[03:26:22] <Darten> I ask to understand if jquery generally handles data badly or if this is just a bad doc example.
[03:27:33] <Uhkis> data handling is up to the coder, that example is just about using the callback. it could just be "// code here" example
[03:27:52] <Uhkis> if you feel that really teaches newer people bad habits, feel free to make a pull request
[06:51:11] <robamman2020> hello i have a problem. on fist ajax get request i get {"readyState":4,"responseText":"","status":200,"statusText":"parsererror"}
[06:51:23] <robamman2020> even though the json format is right
[06:51:41] <robamman2020> JSON itself is {"msgs":[{"nimi":"uniquekey","tekst":"124124124"}]}
[06:51:55] <robertmaxrees> Show your code in a fiddle.
[06:52:26] <robamman2020> it is very compicated... html(jquery,javascript) + java
[06:52:39] <robertmaxrees> -_-
[06:52:53] <robertmaxrees> start with the ajax call
[06:54:31] <robamman2020> https://jsfiddle.net/dcy951xb/
[06:54:48] <robamman2020> the problem is in the submit section
[06:55:05] <robertmaxrees> remove the dataType: "JSON",
[06:56:23] <robamman2020> now i get: {"readyState":4,"responseText":"","status":200,"statusText":"success"}
[06:56:47] <robamman2020> but the json sent from server itself is still: {"msgs":[{"nimi":"uniquekey","tekst":"124124124"}]}
[06:56:54] <robamman2020> and I am not getting this
[06:57:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?
[06:57:17] <robamman2020> the json
[06:57:24] <robamman2020> from the server
[06:57:52] <robertmaxrees> be more specific
[06:58:12] <robamman2020> I want to get the unique key from the server
[06:58:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?  what is happening instead?
[06:58:21] <robamman2020> it is a chatroom
[06:58:55] <robamman2020> ok, i see it is a response header
[06:59:09] <robamman2020> but how do i get the JSON i sent from server to the client
[06:59:10] <robamman2020> ?
[06:59:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting?  what is happening instead?
[06:59:59] <robamman2020> instead the responsetext is empty but the stattus is success, not parseerror
[07:00:36] <robamman2020> instead the responsetext is empty but the status is success, not parsererror
[07:01:06] <robamman2020> I don't see the json , but the status is success
[07:01:22] <robamman2020> or how can i see it on this case ?
[07:01:46] <robertmaxrees> remove the datatype and contenttype.
[07:03:15] <robamman2020> now i get (index):113 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[07:04:08] <robertmaxrees> paste the raw response in a fiddle
[07:06:26] <robamman2020> https://jsfiddle.net/16es5xvz/
[07:06:43] <robertmaxrees> ...
[07:06:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked for.
[07:07:19] <robertmaxrees> go to your network tab, find the request, an copy the response from there.
[07:09:00] <robamman2020> "this request has no response data available"
[07:09:15] <robertmaxrees> uh
[07:09:23] <robertmaxrees> then the issue is with your server
[07:10:02] <robamman2020> but other requests have this
[07:10:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[07:10:50] <robamman2020> yes
[07:11:01] <robamman2020> seems like some sort of server bug
[07:11:06] <robertmaxrees> yep
[07:11:12] <robertmaxrees> so fix your server.
[07:12:16] <robamman2020> yes, but with other requests the request is simpler, on this: http://localhost:5000/serverside?tegevus=saada&nimi=uuuuuuuuuuuuuuutrtttttttt&tekst=fghfghfgh&uniquekey=0&_=1579954035320
[07:12:26] <robamman2020> some _=
[07:12:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[07:12:47] <robertmaxrees> that means literally nothing
[07:15:53] <robamman2020> I looked from the web
[07:16:05] <robamman2020> Seems like it has something to do with timeout
[07:16:06] <robamman2020> https://javascript.develop-bugs.com/article/15363855/How+to+handle%3A+this+request+has+no+response+data+available+%5Bclosed%5D
[07:16:23] <robertmaxrees> i give up.  i don't know why i keep trying here.
[07:16:27] <robertmaxrees> sorry duder,
[07:16:34] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[15:13:05] <crimson_king> If you create and trigger a custom event with jQuery, you can't listen for it with pure JavaScript, can you? Because that's what it seems: https://jsfiddle.net/d9Ltpmos/1/
[15:18:48] <crimson_king> Fixed some typos: https://jsfiddle.net/4jnvfz6r/
[15:26:22] <crimson_king> The expected result, using only jQuery: https://jsfiddle.net/tsok81ue/1/
