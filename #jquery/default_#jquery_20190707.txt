[00:24:10] <alturic> Hello. I have 4 radio input's and I am setting one to checked="checked" by default. I have an on('change') function, but it's not actually firing when the any of the radio inputs are changed, it's only firing when the initial checked="checked" radio is selected again.
[00:24:42] <alturic> Presumably this is due to exactly that, having an initial radio input checked="checked", but I'm unsure how to otherwise handle that.
[00:27:46] <shoky> alturic: should be just `checked` , with no value. the radio's need to have the same name attribute. and you should target all of them together when doing .on('change')
[00:28:01] <shoky> otherwise, show a jsfiddle / testcase

[00:29:13] <shoky> alturic: it's one of the things i said :p
[00:30:48] <alturic> Hmm, so I replaced the checked="checked", with just check. So it's not that. They all have the same name attribute, so it's not that. Now, "target all of them", I *think* I'm doing just that?
[00:31:19] <shoky> alturic:  what are you calling .on('change')  on ?
[00:31:39] <shoky> (and that was checked, not check)
[00:32:50] <alturic> Yea, typo on my part there, but I did change it to checked. So by "target all of them", unless you mean replacing eventTypeRadio.filter(':checked') with eventTypeRadio.on('change') and running the $(this:checked).val() in there?
[00:33:15] <alturic> ^ Yes, presumably not exactly the correct syntax on $(this:checked).val(), but to get the question across...
[00:34:16] <shoky> yep that's what i mean. inside i'd use `eventTypeRadio.filter(':checked').val()`
[00:34:53] <shoky> alturic: or actually probably `this.value` is enough
[00:35:02] <shoky> (same as $(this).val() )
[00:35:42] <alturic> Interesting. Sure enough that worked. https://jsbin.com/lajoruliqo/1/edit
[00:35:58] <alturic> Any reason why you don't have to actually specify that you are looking for the :checked input?
[00:36:20] <alturic> Unless I'm doing something really quirky with these radio boxes, with checkboxes at least, I always have to do that.
[00:36:57] <shoky> alturic: only the checked one will trigger the event. i don't remember if it's just a jquery thing, or general
[00:38:49] <alturic> And yes, this.value worked as well. I must be really old school, never used 'this.value', ha.
[00:39:18] <shoky> $(this).val() just literally does that
[00:40:00] <alturic> So for lack of a better understanding, this.value is straight JS, and jQuery just wraps that in $(this).val()?
[00:40:12] <shoky> yep
[00:41:28] <alturic> Well, thanks for your help. Definitely learned two things tonight. :)
