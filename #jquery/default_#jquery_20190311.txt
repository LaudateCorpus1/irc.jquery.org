[03:24:40] <compact72> hi all, any idea why this simple jquery validaiton won't work? https://jsfiddle.net/compact72/39bfvxah/
[03:25:39] <compact> so simply, but no luck :(
[03:25:48] <compact> it will alert on the click, but not validate
[03:30:41] <compact> ah becasue button type is button and not submit
[05:46:02] <Paradisee> hello guys o/
[05:46:13] <Paradisee> anybody used datatable before here?
[07:03:52] <Aid_> Probably a dumb question, But is it possible for me to get the datepicker to list the next 6 days alongside the one i've currently got slected?
[09:27:33] <madprops> how can i do something like: $(`#Msg-content-${instance.options.id} .filter_input | .filter_input_2`)
[09:27:49] <madprops> (both filter types)
[09:28:02] <Cork> $().find()
[09:28:10] <Cork> css make combos with comma
[09:28:40] <madprops> right
[09:28:45] <madprops> just wondering if there was a shorter way
[09:29:03] <Cork> there is
[09:29:17] <Cork> .find('.class1, .class2')
[09:29:26] <Cork> don't make it as one long string
[09:29:35] <Cork> but use find instead
[09:30:30] <madprops> got it
[09:31:31] <madprops> $(`#Msg-content-${instance.options.id}`).find(".filter_input", ".filter_input_2").eq(0)
[09:31:37] <madprops> im guessing the eq(0) is messing up here
[09:31:50] <madprops> oh wait
[09:31:51] <madprops> it's the quotes
[09:33:20] <madprops> fixed, thanks
[12:23:21] <spinningCat> what is the mistake i did here can you take a look at https://jsfiddle.net/ea4pk0yr/
[12:26:29] <spinningCat> sorry
[16:41:13] <jak2000> hi all
[16:41:33] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:42:03] <jak2000> not know if is a offtopic question but: my question is: i am on a web page... working, input text, codes, etc. etc... and when user go back, sometimes i get this error: ERR_CACHE_MISS    why? not know why, and when how to check?
[16:42:32] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing the error happen?
[16:43:04] <robertmaxrees> use some deductive reasoning :)
[16:44:23] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[16:45:24] <jak2000> in webpage (chrome)
[16:45:39] <jak2000> yes i try, deduce.... but not know...
[16:46:00] <jak2000> checking error message
[16:46:03] <robertmaxrees> alright, so think about it.  does the error realistically have anything to do with you writing code and using jquery as a library?
[16:46:06] <jak2000> ok google
[18:32:11] <jak2000> done.. thanks
