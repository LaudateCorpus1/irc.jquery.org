[00:00:01] <GuruRAM> submit = post, so in response add some js script
[00:00:13] <gnarf> GuruRAM: wrong - submit can also be GET
[00:00:41] <miket3> am i mistaken. but one of the perks for using jquery is browser compatibility?
[00:00:42] <tetradon> I tried to do it from the actual php script being executed but I got an undefined function error because of this MVC. I've called functions from php scripts before by echoing and they have worked. Is there another way to do this?
[00:01:12] <GuruRAM> hmm didn't know that
[00:02:49] <tetradon> gnarf: I understand what you are saying but I kind of don't have time to do through their code. I might have to though it seems at this point.
[00:04:22] <walidvb> gnarf: any clue on how to?
[00:04:23] <walidvb> :)
[00:05:45] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/Hy6kmDnD whats wrong here? the 2nd part causes illegal invocation.
[00:07:00] <GuruRAM> tetradon: i think you have problems in your server response maybe you should add call in page ready handler not just <script...> functionCall() </script>
[00:08:59] <wctaiwan> Coding style (performance / clarity) wise, should I check for an attribute (e.g. if ($("#first").css('opacity') == 1) { ... }) or should I keep a boolean variable, change that every time I modify the attribute and just check that instead?
[00:09:56] <tetradon> GuruRAM: my server response is just an json_encode echo
[00:10:04] <Cork> wctaiwan: as a generic question it can't really be answered
[00:10:16] <Cork> wctaiwan: it depends on how frequent you check the value
[00:10:33] <Cork> if its several times a second, they ya, you should prob do it
[00:10:47] <tetradon> I just don't know how to do a callback here
[00:10:50] <Cork> if its one a click event or something like that; most defenitly over working it
[00:10:59] <tetradon> I'm about to just resort to the damn plugin again
[00:11:00] <tetradon> lol
[00:11:00] <wctaiwan> Okay, thank you.
[00:11:04] <wctaiwan> it was the latter.
[00:12:42] <tetradon> All I need to do is call a function
[00:12:46] <tetradon> from my script
[00:12:55] <tetradon> it doesn't even have to be a callback function honestly
[00:12:59] <tetradon> why is this so hard? lol
[00:13:09] <tetradon> Not for you, I mean me
[00:13:22] <tetradon> I'm screwing this up somehow, lol
[00:13:29] <GuruRAM> tetradon: i mean logic, maybe by the call time, function isn't defined yet, so make your call when function is defined, try to call it with timeout to test, where the problem lies
[00:14:16] <tetradon> I have the functions define before the function that calls the script
[00:14:37] <GuruRAM> its sumbit of the same page right, so actually there is no callback :)
[00:14:57] <GuruRAM> maybe the scope is wrong
[00:15:03] <tetradon> well yeah there isn't technically lol
[00:15:04] <GuruRAM> there is no magic :)
[00:18:19] <tetradon> it does call the php script though
[00:18:19] <tetradon> doesn't refresh the page either and an image is uploaded
[00:18:19] <germanyboy24> http://xeducation.info/2012/02/young-italian-nimfo-teens-loves-group-sex-adolescenza-perversa-italian/
[00:18:19] <tetradon> everything works so far
[00:18:20] <tetradon> just need to call one function to hide the loader gif image
[00:18:37] <tetradon> and also if there is an error, get the error msg from the script
[00:21:20] <tetradon> So just one problem is stumping me and that's Uncaught ReferenceError: processJson is not defined
[00:21:32] <tetradon> I don't understand why
[00:21:59] <tetradon> it's in $(document).ready along with everything else inside the head
[00:22:12] <tetradon> I just echo the javascript in another file
[00:22:20] <tetradon> maybe that's the problem
[00:22:30] <tetradon> but I still think it would be able to see what's in the head
[00:22:54] <tetradon> Well honestly I think it's the framework I'm using which is MVC
[00:23:22] <tetradon> And I'm echoing inside a controller
[00:26:00] <tetradon> If I could use ajax I could have this working
[00:26:37] <tetradon> Because the problem is I call the php script, then after it's just done I just need to return to the javascript function
[00:27:20] <tetradon> can I use ajax on a .submit?
[00:27:23] <tetradon> I wish I could, lol
[00:27:51] <mindis|wurk> erm. you can just prevent the default event and use ajax as normal when submit is pressed
[00:29:55] <tetradon> mindis|wurk: that's not what I mean
[00:30:34] <tetradon> Well I'm trying to do this with a file
[00:30:55] <tetradon> I use .submit
[00:31:28] <tetradon> And I already am using e.preventDefault(); but for another reason
[00:31:44] <tetradon> The file successfully uploads
[00:31:57] <tetradon> But I need a "callback" function afterwards
[00:32:13] <tetradon> If I could call .submit with ajax this would work
[00:32:20] <tetradon> But that's not possible I don't think lol
[00:33:02] <tetradon> Well I can call it in the success function but that's not what I'm trying to do
[00:33:27] <tetradon> I need to call .submit synchronously and then asynchronously call the callback function
[00:33:36] <tetradon> If that makes any sense lol
[00:33:54] <Cork> tetradon: you can't
[00:34:13] <tetradon> So I figured
[00:34:14] <Cork> when js runs syncron, nothing else happens
[00:34:45] <tetradon> So is there anyway to call javascript function from a php script
[00:34:50] <siovene> Hello. In a $(document).one('click', function(ev) {});
[00:34:57] <siovene> Sorry, let me start over.
[00:35:03] <tetradon> I've used echo before but in this case it doesn't seem to work because of the MVC
[00:35:05] <Cork> tetradon: you can implement longpull/comet
[00:35:12] <Cork> tetradon: other then that; no
[00:35:17] <tetradon> what's that?
[00:35:20] <tetradon> longpull?
[00:35:28] <Cork> the browser opens a connection to the server
[00:35:38] <Cork> when the server sends data the connection is closed
[00:35:44] <Cork> and the browser opens a new connection
[00:35:59] <Cork> longpull is cause you turn up the timeout as much as the browser allows
[00:36:13] <siovene> In a $(document).one('click', function(ev) {}), I get ev.target.closest('li'). When my target is an HtmlSelectElement, I get this error: Object #HtmlSelectElement has no method 'closest'. What am I doing wrong?
[00:36:28] <tetradon> I see
[00:36:32] <Cork> tetradon: but then you need to have a way to make two script files talk to each other
[00:36:36] <Cork> (on the server side
[00:36:37] <Cork> )
[00:36:46] <Cork> ex. through a database or something like that
[00:37:24] <Cork> as the php file will be constantly processing until it returns a response to the client
[00:37:43] <tetradon> siovene: you are calling .closest on an event
[00:38:05] <siovene> tetradon: on an event? I'm doing it on ev.target.
[00:38:05] <Cork> tetradon: target is the original element
[00:38:18] <Cork> siovene: though target is a dom element, not a jquery object
[00:38:32] <siovene> Cork: oh I see. Any idea how to get the jquery object?
[00:38:33] <Cork> $(ev.target).closest
[00:38:50] <siovene> Cork: cool, thanks!
[00:38:54] <Cork> np
[00:39:28] <tetradon> wait, so ev isn't an event, Cork?
[00:39:35] <tetradon> Why not?
[00:39:56] <Cork> siovene: btw, you might want to use the delegate syntax instead; would prob make your code simpler
[00:40:05] <Cork> tetradon: it is, but it has a memeber target
[00:40:20] <siovene> Cork: what is that?
[00:40:22] <Cork> tetradon: event.target is the element that was clicked, even if the event bubbles
[00:40:39] <tetradon> ahh I see
[00:40:42] <tetradon> didn't know that
[00:40:49] <Cork> siovene: $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() { this is the selector element });
[00:41:08] <siovene> Cork: oh cool, thanks.
[00:41:34] <Cork> theres som good documentation here see ?.delegate
[00:41:34] <bot-t1> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:52:17] <Xotix> what's wrong with that? data = $(data).find('.thisIsEditable').remove()
[00:53:56] <Cork> without context; nothing
[00:58:04] <walidvb> hi, i'm trying to monitor the width of a div, to trigger a fct when it changes
[01:01:23] <Cork> there is no resize event for normal elements
[01:01:38] <Cork> only window has it, unless you fake it
[01:01:47] <Cork> (like jquery-ui dialog does)
[01:03:49] <nail_> there is some resize plugin that fakes it I think, it polls for the dimension of the selected element every now and then and triggers 'resize' on it
[01:03:58] <nail_> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/ there
[01:04:01] <beasty> haha
[01:04:05] <beasty> fake it like windows
[01:04:07] <beasty> n1 Cork
[01:04:58] <Cork> beasty:uh what?
[01:06:19] <walidvb> nail_: lemme check that, thanks
[01:27:38] <Xotix> i have a varaibel with some html in it. I now need to delete some items which are having a class assigned and save it back to that var. how would i do that? http://jsfiddle.net/Ls2Fw/
[01:35:35] <nail_> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/Ls2Fw/2/ ?
[01:37:47] <iLearn> hello good people
[01:37:51] <iLearn> hello buddy _W_
[01:38:41] <iLearn> i just used this selector: $('.nav li a').click(function(){}). now i want to loop through each a in that selector and set their class attrib
[01:39:11] <iLearn> also i would like to get the one that was exactly clicked.
[01:39:19] <iLearn> ie one of them triggered the event itself
[01:39:37] <iLearn> others class="", the others that trigger it to be class="active"
[01:39:46] <eddyb> http://jsfiddle.net/yBwAx/ my editor finally works :)
[01:39:53] <xec> iLearn: on click on any a should set a class on every a?
[01:40:22] <Xotix> nail_ my application dies on that ^^
[01:40:35] <xec> iLearn: i see what you mean. store the selection in a var, remove the class from all of them in the click event, and use $(this) to access the clicked element
[01:41:04] <Xotix> but basically yes thanks
[01:42:03] <xec> iLearn: .removeClass() will apply to all elements in a selection so you don't need to loop
[01:42:17] <nathanstaines> anyone here using sublime text 2 and handlebars.js ?
[01:42:35] <xec> ?anyone @ nathanstaines
[01:42:35] <bot-t1> nathanstaines, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[01:42:53] <aqeel> lol
[01:43:01] <iLearn> xec: on click all css should be set to the default class="", while the one that actually triggered the event should be set to class="active"
[01:43:02] <iLearn> a typical class switching activity
[01:43:02] <iLearn> tab switching activity*
[01:43:02] <iLearn> xec: can you assist?
[01:43:03] <aqeel> nice one bot;)
[01:43:11] <Xotix> is find() a very hungry function?
[01:43:25] <nathanstaines> right. I'm trying to get autocompletion to work for html within the script tags
[01:43:26] <aqeel> yes indeed it is.....xotox
[01:43:28] <xec> Xotix: it eats regularly
[01:44:18] <iLearn> xec: am going to try that thank you. i can do this $(this).addClass("active")
[01:44:29] <xec> yes
[01:44:51] <badoskie> Masonry plugin alters Twitter bootstrap's layout
[01:44:59] <badoskie> Has anybody else experienced it?
[01:45:00] <iLearn> xec: is there a different command for removing all class. or would that .removeClass() still apply pls?
[01:45:02] <Xotix> i have a find and after the find i have a post. how can i make sure, the post gets called when find is finished? somehow, it kills my application
[01:45:32] <xec> nathanstaines: you will probably have more luck with that question in a forum for either handlebars or sublime text
[01:45:45] <nathanstaines> ok, thanks ;)
[01:46:37] <xec> iLearn: if you have stored the selection, just call .removeClass() on it - it will apply to the whole collection
[01:46:41] <Anorov> i'm using .replaceWith(), and i notice it creates a jarring effect where the div vanishes and the below div comes up to take its place and then goes back down again when the replacement loads. is there any way to deal with that?
[01:46:59] <Anorov> i want my original thing i'm replacing to stay in place as it's being replaced, if possible
[01:48:08] <aqeel>   anorov....are u replacing contents or entire div?
[01:48:32] <Anorov> aqeel: replacing the entire div. i tried replacing the contents with .html() but it did not quite work right
[01:49:10] <xec> iLearn: http://jsfiddle.net/vHNrG/
[01:49:13] <imc> hello
[01:49:18] <aqeel> well i have done that.....jailbreak.webege.com......hover over the links and see the contents changed
[01:49:27] <Anorov> i'll take a look
[01:49:31] <aqeel> if that is what u want i can guide you
[01:49:38] <imc> what happend if i do $detachedElement.insertAfter($someOtherElement); ?
[01:49:43] <Cork> Anorov: not sure it will give you the effect your looking for, but you might solve it by pre parsing the html
[01:50:04] <imc> in particular, if I insert $detachedElement after doing the insertAfter, the $someOtherElement is also insered into DOM?
[01:50:06] <aqeel> i am also replacinfg the entire div
[01:50:17] <imc> (the variable names are not arbitrary)
[01:50:22] <Anorov> jailbreak.webege.com won't load for me, aqeel
[01:50:34] <aqeel> ???
[01:50:47] <aqeel> is you rjavascript enabled in browser?
[01:50:51] <aqeel> your*
[01:51:09] <Anorov> i mean the server won't respond
[01:51:28] <aqeel> can u try proxy sites/
[01:51:29] <defendguin> I should be able to do something like this right??   $('#some_element_id').on( 'pagebeforecreate',function(event){  alert('here'); });  right?   trying to figure out why this even on jqm isn't firing
[01:51:43] <Anorov> strange, a proxy works
[01:51:45] <aqeel> ok anyhow i explain what i have done....
[01:51:56] <Anorov> maybe 000webhost banned my IP or something...
[01:51:59] <TuxBlackEdo> how would i remotely control a clients browser content, in such a way to load an external url, also if i feed a new url from the server to the client's browser window it will load without refresh on the client side?
[01:52:05] <iLearn> xec: hi buddy, this is what am doing: http://pastebin.com/FXeSjN1p
[01:52:57] <aqeel> if u see the code.....there is no text in html....index
[01:53:16] <aqeel> all have been moved to external file into indiivdual divs...
[01:53:35] <xec> iLearn: yes that will work to, but now you're searching the DOM on every click. if you got a big page this could be slow
[01:53:42] <xec> too*
[01:54:07] <iLearn> xec: it didnt work though. sadly!
[01:54:09] <aqeel> is this what u are looking to do with your content replaced?
[01:54:28] <Anorov> kind of
[01:54:32] <xec> iLearn: you forgot to specify what class to remove
[01:54:40] <xec> iLearn: .removeClass("active");
[01:54:44] <aqeel> i can guide you....u got fiddle
[01:55:31] <Anorov> actually, i'll just upload a fiddle with my problem first
[01:55:36] <aqeel> first off.....u want all div to be visible or ssome hidden and otehrs visible....
[01:55:44] <aqeel> better
[01:55:48] <Anorov> it's hard to explain. i'll just try and show it
[01:56:02] <badoskie> Has anybody else experienced it?
[01:56:16] <aqeel> ok...
[01:56:25] <iLearn> xec: whu double quotes? am confused on when to use single or double quotes
[01:56:27] <badoskie> jquery masonry shifts twitter bootstrap layout
[01:56:55] <xec> iLearn: it doesn't matter
[01:57:46] <iLearn> xec: does the href matter? currently set to #foo, #bar, #etc
[01:57:55] <nFFF> Just make sure any strings inside the qoutes are the opposite :>
[01:58:12] <xec> iLearn: it shouldn't
[01:58:52] <xec> iLearn: but if there is an element with id "foo" the page will scroll there
[01:59:22] <xec> iLearn: so you might want to use event.preventDefault(); in your click handler
[01:59:22] <Whirl3d> hey all, could someone tell me if this is a good time to use a deferred? in "activating" a li that contains a form element that just received focus, I need to see if a popup panel is visible. If it is, I want to hide it, update it, and show it in a new position. If not, just update it and show it in a new position.
[01:59:44] <xec> iLearn: the first parameter sent to the handler is the event object
[02:00:18] <Xotix> if i have $(data).find('.thisIsEditable').remove().end() and i want the html with the wrapper. How do i get it?
[02:00:19] <Cork> Whirl3d: why would you need deferred there?
[02:00:38] <Cork> Whirl3d: deferred is just another way of sending callback functions into a function
[02:00:46] <xec> Whirl3d: would it hurt to hide a hidden element?
[02:01:21] <Whirl3d> xec, it would cause a delay because of how the animation engine works.
[02:01:53] <Whirl3d> cork, I want to wait until the "info" panel is hidden to "activate" the newly focused field (where the info panel will go next)
[02:02:01] <Xotix> Can i simplify that $('<div>').append($(data).find('.thisIsEditable').remove().end().clone()).remove().html();?
[02:02:08] <xec> Whirl3d: ok, then just check if it is visible, and only hide it if it is shown?
[02:02:17] <iLearn> xec: okay. thanks for your help. one more thing though. on click of $('.nav li a') it is $('.nav li').removeClass("active") i need to do. without the a.
[02:02:19] <Whirl3d> but if it's already hidden, I don't want to wait for the animation engine to do nothing...
[02:02:29] <Cork> Xotix: you don't need the last remove
[02:02:45] <Whirl3d> xec, cork, thanks for your help, btw.
[02:02:50] <xec> iLearn: then you might want to *add* the class to the LI as well?
[02:02:51] <Whirl3d> xec, sure. that's the easy part
[02:03:29] <Whirl3d> but I have to duplicate the "activate" part (once for the callback of the "hide info" function ) and once for the "already hidden" info panel state
[02:03:39] <diverdude> Is it possible to have all panels initially collapsed in the accordian widget of jquery ui?
[02:03:41] <Xotix> Cork thanks
[02:04:20] <Cork> Whirl3d: i meant function(callback) {  } is the same as (function() { return deferred; }).then(function(){})
[02:04:51] <iLearn> xec: done! am watching for clicks on the li. instead. thank you very much. I wonder how i could remove all class from an element on one command though
[02:05:02] <Cork> Whirl3d: its just a way of passing control back and forth
[02:05:37] <aqeel> $("*").removeClass("class_name");
[02:06:07] <Cork> uh... why not just $('.class_name').removeClass('class_name') ?
[02:06:08] <aqeel> * universal....select all
[02:06:24] <xec> aqeel: hehe, dirty!
[02:06:43] <aqeel> lol
[02:06:58] <xec> iLearn: did you see the demo i made, where i cached the selector?
[02:06:58] <aqeel> ;)
[02:07:27] <iLearn> xec: yes i did
[02:08:45] <iLearn> you used red as active in css, etc. i mean if an element has several class attached to it, and i want to remove all
[02:09:04] <iLearn> $('foo').removeClass(); //should remove all? :/
[02:10:00] <aqeel> ok......div clas="a b c d "in html..............jquery.......$("div").removeClass("a, b, c, d")................your div is without any class now
[02:10:30] <nFFF> Is there any easier way of doing that?
[02:10:30] <rhizmoe> hi all. can i use true/false to test whether a variable is not null?
[02:10:37] <nFFF> like attr('class','')
[02:10:50] <aqeel> and remember any other div of that class will have its class removed too
[02:11:13] <iLearn> nFFF: much better
[02:11:15] <iLearn> :D
[02:11:38] <nFFF> actually just dont pass any arguments to removeClass()
[02:11:50] <nFFF> it will remove them alll
[02:12:45] <aqeel> yup that works too but becarefull with element part....or all classes will get removed fromt hat element
[02:14:51] <Whirl3d> Cork, here is heavily commented source for what I was asking about.
[02:14:52] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/cqHuY/2/
[02:15:08] <iLearn> aqeel: thanks. noted
[02:19:09] <nFFF> Whirl3d, I can't help but feel like this code is way complicated, but I don't fully understand what you are trying to achieve
[02:19:15] <aqeel> ok room got to go ...bye.....see u within 3 hours...
[02:19:35] <aqeel> going home from work now...
[02:19:41] <Whirl3d> nFFF, would not be the least bit surprised if it was. I have a tendency to make things too complicated.
[02:19:46] <Whirl3d> gnite aqeel
[02:20:07] <aqeel> bye
[02:22:01] <nFFF> Whirl3d, what is an infopanel?
[02:22:24] <Whirl3d> nFFF, basically, the instructions, error info, notes, and a control panel to select the level of detail
[02:22:40] <nFFF> And you want to hide it, when?
[02:22:45] <nFFF> Adn you want to show it, when?
[02:23:13] <Whirl3d> it has to be updated in position and content when a new li.formField is "activated" (by having a decendant element receive focus)
[02:23:22] <Jbom> hi
[02:23:50] <Jbom> Can anyone help?
[02:23:57] <Jbom> http://pastebin.com/geQ2dsmp
[02:23:58] <nFFF> So basically when you click on an input element to enter text, you want some sort of ifo box above it to help give instructions?
[02:24:12] <Jbom> I have that code, and I want is that when loading the image delete the div. loadding and show me the picture with a fadeIn.
[02:24:22] <Jbom> but I do not shoot the event for all pictures
[02:24:28] <Whirl3d> yep. And to hold the errors and let you select "advanced" or "detail" input modes
[02:26:45] <nFFF> Ok, so when on focus add a class, and on blur remove the class?
[02:26:49] <Whirl3d> jbom, if the image is already cached or if it's a tiny image, the load handler never gets called if you define the image elements src attribute in marking
[02:27:50] <Whirl3d> nFFF, yes and no. I'm handing the focusin and focusout events for the form element. some "li.formField" elements have multiple input elements (like firstname and lastname)
[02:27:58] <soee> hi, is there some way to make plugins like fancybox work when content is loaded using ajax? something like live. for it?
[02:28:23] <nFFF> I can't even follow your code or what your actually trying to do, sorry, perhaps someone else can help
[02:28:43] <Whirl3d> nFFF, let me update it. It'll make more sense in a second
[02:29:36] <raj> anyone with ANY experience using jstree?
[02:30:16] <nFFF> But are you literally just wanting to display an info box above each form element? (and remove from previous element when click on new) ?
[02:31:58] <Whirl3d> Some of my form elements have 5 or six input elements
[02:32:01] <Whirl3d> like phone number
[02:32:45] <nFFF> Some of your form elements have 5 or 6 input elements?
[02:33:01] <nFFF> That doesn't make sense
[02:33:06] <nFFF> an input si a form element
[02:33:24] <Whirl3d> Each li.formField element holds several input elements
[02:33:33] <nFFF> Do you have multiple forms ?
[02:34:03] <Jbom> Whirl3d: then if they are in cache as I have to??
[02:35:14] <nFFF> Whirl3d, whats that got to do with anything
[02:35:21] <nFFF> But are you literally just wanting to display an info box above each form element? (and remove from previous element when click on new) ? <----- is this your goal?
[02:35:58] <Whirl3d> jbom, the best way that I know to handle it is to add the image elements new. Then you can attach the load handler to the image element, THEN apply it's src attribute (which will get it loading) and then immediately check to see if the source element's .complete attribute is true and manually trigger the load handler.
[02:36:42] <Whirl3d> nFFF, gimme just a second to update my fiddle. Thanks for your help, btw
[02:37:22] <nFFF> Things like: frm.data("currentField",fld); what is the point of this? it changes everytime you change to a different field, it seems redundant, do you ever use this data form
[02:37:54] <Xotix> is it possible to add several borders to an element?
[02:39:07] <nFFF> Xotix, sure $('.foo').css({border-right:'9px solid black', border-left:'9px dotted red'});
[02:42:05] <Xotix> nFFF i got some elements (img's= which are editable. And to show which one are editable i thought i just add a border. but the element may already contain a boarder. … this isn't possible, right?  maybe i can add an edit icon on the left top corner somehow?
[02:43:12] <ribot> hi
[02:43:35] <ribot> how do i use the icons included in jqui
[02:43:55] <Jbom> Whirl3d: and if I put onload = 'complete (this)' in the html?
[02:48:39] <beasty> mm pondering if this is possible
[02:48:43] <Xotix> e.g if i have jQuery.fn.applyEditor = function(e) {function foo()} how would i call foo()? Shouldn't $,applyEditor().foo() work?
[02:48:55] <Whirl3d> nFFF, the currentField value doesn't change when you go from firstname to lastName in the "li.formField" element for "contactName"
[02:49:00] <beasty> lets say i have a { 0: 'foo', 1: 'bar'}  that i delete the '1'
[02:52:31] <jita> I am using 2 jquery ui dialogs in a same page
[02:52:33] <jita> using $( "#dialog-form, #comment-form" ).dialog
[02:52:45] <jita> how can i know which dialog is being accessed ?
[02:52:54] <jita> so that i could submit different forms
[02:53:07] <jita> when the first dialog is opened
[02:53:16] <jita> i want to submit first form
[02:53:22] <jita> if second if want to submit second
[02:54:08] <jita> can i do if $(this).id == dialog-form ?
[02:54:34] <beasty> $(this).attr('id')
[02:54:45] <nFFF> Xotix, $.fn.applyEditor.foo()
[02:56:24] <Silex> I have a weird bug that only happens the first time a page is loaded. There's a css that applies a margin on the last-child property of a collection. Said collection is inserted dynamically after an ajax request. Then I have a $(document).ready function that computes the height of document and adapts a vertical line accordingly, but it doesnt' work the first time only when I refresh the page
[02:56:25] <iLearn> anybody got any idea what this means: <a href="javascript:void(0);"/>
[02:56:39] <Silex> I tried changing it to $(window).load witgout success
[02:56:43] <Silex> without*
[02:57:30] <Xotix> nFFF no. getting the error, has no method. i just go ta normal function in there. not something like applyEditor = function
[02:58:39] <Silex> I think jQuery gets confused about the document height because of that weird selector and the dynamically insertion of elements
[02:59:37] <beasty> Cork: alive ? :p </personal help beg>
[03:01:41] <jita> beasty, thaks
[03:06:11] <iLearn> i want to simulate an onclick of a div launch of a file open dialog. am trying to nest a div tag inside a <input type="file" style="display:none"/> so far so bad its not working for me.
[03:06:58] <Xotix> I'd like to call callMe() on a page where the file got included http://pastebin.com/Ft9zNFDA
[03:12:44] <xec> Xotix: that function only exists within the plugin's namespace.
[03:13:25] <Xotix> ok
[03:14:13] <nFFF> Xotix
[03:14:13] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/WsxqL/
[03:14:25] <nFFF> Thats how you access a function within a function
[03:14:58] <BlaDe^> Hi, has anyone got experience with flot ?
[03:15:09] <nFFF> You can't access it directly, you have to return an object of the deep function, from within the first function if that makes sense :<
[03:15:59] <coldhead> BlaDe^: just ask your question
[03:16:07] <xec> nFFF: why are you doing new foo() and new Object()?
[03:16:07] <BlaDe^> coldhead: why doesn't this plot anything: http://martins-creations.co.uk/fs07.php
[03:16:10] <artiintell_> hi guys
[03:16:18] <artiintell_> i am new for  jquery
[03:16:20] <xec> nFFF, Xotix; http://jsfiddle.net/WsxqL/1/
[03:16:21] <Xotix> nFFF: thanks
[03:16:26] <coldhead> artiintell_: it's my first day
[03:16:27] <nFFF> xec, to make it clear its an object
[03:16:29] <nFFF> for Xotix
[03:16:43] <artiintell_> I need to draw two graphs in the plot
[03:16:47] <nFFF> It helps understand better
[03:16:49] <artiintell_> how do i do this?
[03:16:55] <artiintell_> any suggestion?
[03:17:13] <Xotix> nFFF:  yeah i see it. but can't i jsut assign the func as a property an then do $.fn.applyEditor.foo ?
[03:17:15] <nFFF> I know everything in JS is an object, but when learning about scope and closures I find it helpful to explicitly  call them
[03:18:18] <mac_mattias> Are you guys forgiving towards newbies on jquery? :D
[03:18:24] <artiintell_> ???
[03:18:26] <coldhead> BlaDe^: this is not a flot problem
[03:18:30] <nFFF> no functions aren't like classes in other languages, in the sense they don't have personal methods or data, they simply have their own first class functions
[03:18:36] <coldhead> this is your are not including your scripts properly
[03:18:43] <BlaDe^> coldhead: huh?
[03:18:47] <coldhead> you can't do <script /><script>
[03:18:47] <nFFF> Everything is out of scope within JS, so you need to pass the object down a scope
[03:18:51] <coldhead> er
[03:18:55] <xec> mac_mattias: relatively. we expect people to make an effort though ;)
[03:18:56] <coldhead> <script />
[03:19:11] <coldhead> you need <script></script>
[03:19:17] <gnarf> yeah - no self close for script
[03:19:19] <mac_mattias> xec: Thanks!
[03:19:19] <gnarf> it gets buggy
[03:19:20] <coldhead> even when you are srcing the script
[03:19:30] <coldhead> none of your JS is running
[03:19:36] <coldhead> flot or not flot
[03:19:38] <xec> ?ask @ mac_mattias
[03:19:39] <bot-t1> mac_mattias, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:20:11] <Xotix> nFFF:  but i can't return it . then i'd need to refactor my plugin just for that little thing.i just want a public static function within my plugin. i just want to call it from outside
[03:20:14] <coldhead> great job everyone, take 5
[03:20:20] <nFFF> Xotix, see : http://jsfiddle.net/WsxqL/2/
[03:20:27] <gnarf> coldhead has been a jQuery newbie ever since i got here
[03:20:38] <fof> i think we're in a dick-free zone at the moment mac_mattias
[03:20:43] <BlaDe^> Ahhh doh
[03:20:53] <BlaDe^> ok, that's better
[03:20:54] <nFFF> Xotix, theres no such thing as a public function, within a function
[03:21:00] <mac_mattias> fof: sounds good. Well I do my own google research before I ask anything. :)
[03:21:04] <nFFF> If you want a public function, put it within a public scope
[03:21:13] <fof> aaronmcadam nowhere to be seen
[03:21:16] <coldhead> good luck BlaDe^
[03:21:16] <fof> :)
[03:21:22] <nFFF> Or retunr it as an object
[03:21:39] <BlaDe^> coldhead: ok so now it's just not plotting the data set ;) how do I figure that out
[03:21:54] <Trisox> coldhead
[03:21:54] <caniuse> Trisox: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[03:22:02] <Trisox> :D
[03:22:04] <BlaDe^> i want to plot a linegraph of how many timestamps per minute, pretty much... to get an idea of failure rates
[03:22:19] <Trisox> caniuse
[03:22:28] <Trisox> coldhead: hows life
[03:22:43] <nFFF> Xotix, perhaps this helps understand :p http://jsfiddle.net/WsxqL/3/
[03:22:53] <Xotix> nFFF:  don't know how i would need to do that within a plugin. also it does sound wrong. then i'd need to return aplyEditor itself so callMe is a proper method of it.Anyway, i'l lremember that in the future.
[03:22:59] <Trisox> hey nFFF
[03:23:17] <nFFF> Xotix, it's just different then C++ :P
[03:23:25] <nFFF> hai :>
[03:23:25] <Trisox> so bored soo drowsy ... yawnnnn time for a lunch break
[03:23:30] <Trisox> :)
[03:23:46] <Xotix> nFFF: it isn't that complicated. I'm just thinking of what makes the most sense. I just run into a design problem caused by missing experience.
[03:25:05] <Jbom> Whirl3d: I've fixed it so if you it's worth
[03:25:07] <nFFF> Yea, I kind of find it easier than C++ and other OOP languages in some respects, as you don't have to worry about public private friend functions, inheritence
[03:25:16] <Jbom> $(".photo .attachment-photo").one('load',function(){
[03:25:16] <Jbom> function complete(item){
[03:25:16] <Jbom> $(item).fadeIn(800);
[03:25:16] <Jbom> }
[03:25:16] <Jbom> foto = $(this);
[03:25:17] <Jbom> $(".loadding",$(this).parent()).fadeOut(300,complete(foto));
[03:25:17] <Jbom> }).each(function(){
[03:25:18] <Jbom> if(this.complete) $(this).load();
[03:25:18] <Jbom> });
[03:25:23] <nFFF> You just need to learn everything is out of scope :)
[03:25:37] <xec> Jbom: don't paste in channel, use a service like jsfiddle.net
[03:26:01] <Trisox> ?paste @ Jbom
[03:26:02] <bot-t1> Jbom, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:26:04] <BlaDe^> coldhead: any ideas why it's just blank? my data set looks fine...
[03:26:20] <Xotix> nFFF:  and thats prototypal?
[03:26:46] <Jbom> sorry, as was little I thought I could put here
[03:27:17] <nFFF> Exactly
[03:27:55] <xec> Xotix, nFFF: not quite. there is no inheritance going on in this case
[03:28:12] <nFFF> But you can extend a function
[03:28:17] <nFFF> with .prototype
[03:28:21] <nFFF> which is similiar
[03:28:56] <xec> but there is still no inheritance
[03:28:57] <Xotix> nFFF you got some article about the difference between normal oop and prototypal?
[03:29:31] <nFFF> Xotix, I actually just watched a cool video last night
[03:29:32] <nFFF> sec
[03:29:43] <xec> Xotix: http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter8.html
[03:29:55] <nFFF> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seX7jYI96GE
[03:30:10] <nFFF> That video is really good to explain it coming from a traditional OOP background
[03:30:16] <nFFF> Or in fact just any other language
[03:30:23] <Xotix> xec i know that one. Can't remember if i've read that chapter.
[03:30:37] <Xotix> thanks
[03:31:03] <nFFF> Id skip first 5 minutes of the video
[03:31:12] <nFFF> but from 10mins+ its pure knowledge son
[03:31:29] <Xotix> ok thanks
[03:32:26] <fotoflo> quick question - i have $("#RFID_ID").keyup(function(e){ if(e.keyCode == 13){  //  dont do anything at all  //  }});
[03:32:41] <fotoflo> how do i stop that return from being sent?
[03:32:58] <nFFF> ?preventdefault
[03:32:59] <bot-t1> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[03:33:33] <fotoflo> thanks!
[03:34:53] <fotoflo> nFFF: i will also have to slice that char off the string that gets entered?
[03:35:14] <nFFF> slice what character?
[03:35:26] <fotoflo>  if(e.keyCode == 13)
[03:35:40] <fotoflo> nope prevent default is still submitting a form
[03:35:40] <nFFF> what string?
[03:35:51] <fotoflo> I'm detecting a charrage return in an <input>
[03:36:04] <fotoflo> hoping to chomp it off and not submit the form in one foul swoop
[03:36:41] <nFFF> $("#RFID_ID").keyup(function(e){ if(e.keyCode == 13){ e.preventDefault(); }); doesn't work?
[03:36:41] <coldhead> hey Trisox
[03:36:46] <coldhead> BlaDe^: i'm taking a look
[03:36:53] <fotoflo> nFFF nope
[03:36:55] <BlaDe^> coldhead: it's plotting now but my dataset is wrong I think
[03:37:05] <nFFF> $("#RFID_ID").keyup(function(e){ if(e.keyCode == 13){ e.preventDefault(); } }); even
[03:37:18] <fotoflo> form still gets submitted
[03:37:35] <mindis|wurk> um, maybe the event gets triggered by keydown instead of up?
[03:37:36] <fotoflo> but the other stuff in the if statement is getting run
[03:37:37] <nFFF> return false?
[03:37:51] <nFFF> $("#RFID_ID").keyup(function(e){ if(e.keyCode == 13){ return false; } }); even
[03:37:54] <coldhead> cool BlaDe^
[03:38:00] <NoReGreT> i have a .click event on a certain selector, how can I make that event active when inserting that selector dynamically?
[03:38:02] <nFFF> just keep trying negatives till something works :P
[03:38:02] <coldhead> make sure you read the text file that comes with flot carefully
[03:38:07] <BlaDe^> coldhead: isn't cool, doesn't look right ;)
[03:38:09] <coldhead> it has everything you need to know
[03:38:12] <fotoflo> switched till keydown
[03:38:13] <fotoflo> works
[03:38:14] <fotoflo> thanks!
[03:38:34] <nFFF> :>
[03:38:51] <mindis|wurk> NoReGreT use .on() on the parent element
[03:39:07] <BlaDe^> coldhead: i've read it... but it doesn't help you find an issue with your dataset
[03:39:45] <coldhead> it gives you good examples of what datasets need to be like
[03:39:56] <coldhead> did me right many times
[03:40:14] <BlaDe^> sure i'm looking at: view-source:http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/time.html
[03:41:14] <NoReGreT> mindis|wurk: what do you mean ? i'm adding a click event on an element and the dynamically created one isn't neccessarily its child..
[03:41:32] <coldhead> BlaDe^: shouldn't your points be in pairs rather than one long list?
[03:41:40] <mindis|wurk> NoReGreT then add it somewhere even further up the DOM
[03:41:53] <coldhead> [ [a1, b1] [a2, b2] [...] ] ?
[03:42:11] <mindis|wurk> or add the event to the one you created after you made it if you want to do it manually
[03:43:08] <Xotix> is there a difference between (function() {}) and function() {}?
[03:44:07] <NoReGreT> mindis|wurk: i tried added after its creation, but it went crazy, the event was to slidtoggle the next() element, and it just kept sliding up/down, i had to reload the page to stop it... any idea of the reason ?
[03:44:55] <mindis|wurk> dunno, bad handling of callbacks?
[03:45:08] <nFFF> Xotix, scope
[03:45:22] <BlaDe^> coldhead: ok now it looks closer
[03:46:11] <Xotix> put () doesn't create an obj right?
[03:48:03] <Articate> Is there a way to add rows to a table with jquery?
[03:49:06] <mindis|wurk> just add them like any other element
[03:49:26] <sahbeewah> what is put()
[03:49:39] <Xotix> Articate you might look at datatables plugin if you have some heavy table stuff
[03:50:44] <ravenzz> i thinke that he was talking about html tables
[03:51:45] <ravenzz> ?append @ Articate
[03:51:45] <bot-t1> Articate, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[03:52:13] <Articate> thank you :)
[03:52:45] <ravenzz> you can also prepend or use before/after to insert before/after a specific row
[03:55:14] <itatitat> ey guys
[03:55:21] <itatitat> I have a problem with hover
[03:56:03] <itatitat> my function work with the mouse inside but not wen im going out
[03:56:32] <mindis|wurk> that's not very specific
[03:56:54] <itatitat> ok
[03:57:12] <itatitat> My hover work fine with the handler in, but not with the handler out
[03:57:18] <itatitat> I dont uderstand...
[03:57:24] <itatitat> I dont know what happend
[03:57:38] <itatitat> I want that a div chang the color of the background
[03:57:44] <itatitat> and only work the handler in
[03:58:01] <mindis|wurk> sounds more like you need mouseover and mouseout instead of hover
[03:58:11] <itatitat> reall?
[03:58:12] <itatitat> ok
[03:58:15] <itatitat> Im going to try
[03:58:16] <itatitat> thanks
[04:01:28] <sahbeewah> isn't hover just jquery's encapsulation of mouseout/mouseover
[04:01:32] <sahbeewah> should work either way
[04:02:20] <mindis|wurk> yep, but it might be easier to do it this way
[04:02:23] <itatitat> yes...I tried just now and happend the shame...
[04:02:50] <mindis|wurk> jsfiddle it then
[04:03:52] <itatitat> jaja
[04:03:54] <itatitat> okok
[04:05:18] <mindis|wurk> http://jsfiddle.net/4x5ae/ shouldn't be any harder than this
[04:08:55] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/UkcLG/
[04:09:13] <itatitat> sorry!, I'm working in another computer, so that I write the code
[04:10:03] <itatitat> is this my code
[04:10:04] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/UkcLG/1/
[04:10:15] <fof> itatitat: is that the same syntax?
[04:10:16] <olleman> and my axe
[04:10:36] <NoReGreT> if I have a several <a> how can I have them like radio buttons? for example, i click one link, it gets highlighted. I click another link, the old link's highlight is removed and the click one is highlighted.. not sure if it's clear..
[04:10:41] <fof> click jslint, also choose jquery from frameworks on left
[04:10:42] <itatitat> .......yes
[04:10:49] <itatitat> is wrong?
[04:10:59] <fof> yeah
[04:11:09] <fof> look at mindis|wurk's example
[04:11:20] <fof> to see correct syntax
[04:11:50] <itatitat> jummm
[04:12:16] <itatitat> but can be wrong owing to the syntax?
[04:12:55] <itatitat> I mean....the code is ok o no?
[04:13:07] <fof> compare it with mindis|wurk's
[04:13:25] <soc42> hi #jquery
[04:13:29] <soc42> for the sake of a printing page i'd like to set all input fields in a given form to disable/readonly, but $('INPUT').attr("disabled", true) won't do the job...
[04:14:17] <Articate> when I'm using .append() to a table to add rows, I want to add after the last row. Right now each row is indexed with a number - is there a smart way to traverse all the rows, find the biggest index and append after that?
[04:14:32] <soc42> what's wrong with this selector?
[04:15:03] <itatitat> ok
[04:15:05] <itatitat> is diferent
[04:15:08] <itatitat> but I dont understand
[04:15:16] <itatitat> I used many times this syntax and worked fine
[04:15:32] <Articate> soc42: you want .attr("disabled", "disabled")
[04:15:46] <LordThumper> Hey, why doesn't .ajax() have a start callback parameter?
[04:15:53] <mindis|wurk> itatitat your hover syntax is way off
[04:16:07] <mindis|wurk> it's not hover{}, it's hover() etc.
[04:16:13] <itatitat> aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[04:16:29] <itatitat> I understand now....thanks a lot mindis...
[04:17:06] <itatitat> ou sorry!
[04:17:23] <itatitat> I mistake in the URL
[04:17:29] <itatitat> but in my code I used ()
[04:17:47] <soc42> hey Articate: is the html tag element selector case-sensitive?
[04:18:34] <Articate> I see no reason not to assume that. But I don't know
[04:18:49] <afd__> hi guys! I'm loading some content through ajax in a bigger cms, is there a way to fake a trigger of the dom ready event?
[04:18:50] <sahbeewah> no it's not case sensitive
[04:19:09] <mindis|wurk> itatitat see http://jsfiddle.net/UkcLG/3/
[04:19:23] <itatitat> I go
[04:19:24] <afd__> I mean, I want what's executed when the page loads, to also be executed when I put the new content on the page
[04:21:01] <sahbeewah> is the code you're executing your own?
[04:21:47] <soc42> mmh... doesn't work yet...
[04:23:56] <itatitat> jummm
[04:23:58] <itatitat> mindis
[04:24:13] <itatitat> If a press run I dont see anything
[04:24:24] <itatitat> but I see the code when I use in my code
[04:24:35] <itatitat> I see in and out
[04:25:04] <mindis|wurk> soc42 something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6QJhs/
[04:25:24] <Articate> when I'm using .append() to a table to add rows, I want to add after the last row. Right now each row is indexed with a number - is there a smart way to traverse all the rows, find the biggest index and append after that?
[04:25:49] <mindis|wurk> if you use append the new row is automatically the last one
[04:26:13] <mindis|wurk> unless i somehow misunderstood the question
[04:26:15] <soc42> mindis|wurk: wait a mom... i'll do a test-drive ;o)
[04:26:26] <Articate> I have to append after an identifier, right?
[04:26:37] <Articate> so I need to find the last row in the table to append after it
[04:26:45] <mindis|wurk> nope
[04:26:57] <Articate> then I'm going back to the documentation :)
[04:27:08] <mindis|wurk> you just yourtable.append('yourcodehere')
[04:27:23] <mindis|wurk> don't mix .append with .after
[04:28:10] <Ringolas> http://pastebin.com/k3WDyUDn Why won't this work?
[04:28:17] <Ringolas> I can only see one image
[04:28:58] <Ringolas> Can anyone please help me
[04:29:05] <Articate> Ok, then I have still sort of the same problem - when I append, I have to add an input with a name, which should be the index of the row (for when I submit and php does the rest)
[04:29:35] <soc42> mindis|wurk: your example seems to work well, so i think i need to some troubleshooting on my site context first... thanksalot
[04:29:37] <Articate> when I load the page, it's an arbitrary amount of rows, so I need to somehow figure out how many rows currently exist
[04:30:15] <mindis|wurk> yourtable.find('tr').length
[04:30:52] <Articate> sweet. thanks :)
[04:31:50] <mindis|wurk> if you can also remove rows then you might want to update the index fields at some point
[04:32:58] <Articate> yeah. Hmm. thanks! :)
[04:33:02] <soc42> hey mindis|wurk: k, it works seemlessly now – had to fix another bug first...
[04:33:25] <mindis|wurk> good, good
[04:38:47] <itatitat> ok
[04:38:49] <itatitat> now is working
[04:49:17] <mindis|wurk> if something is .removed, does it automatically also remove any event handlers associated with it or do you have to unbind them first to be sure?
[04:49:33] <germanyboy24> http://xeducation.info/2012/03/gorgeous-brunette-milf-teacher-punishes-her-student/
[04:50:06] <murr4y> mindis|wurk: In addition to the elements themselves, all bound events and jQuery data associated with the elements are removed.
[04:52:03] <Cork> and also the events bound on the element is cleaned up by the browser when it gc the elements
[04:52:39] <mindis|wurk> ahh
[04:53:01] <mindis|wurk> is it even possible to cause memory leaks with poor removal of stuff then?
[04:53:07] <aadios> can any one help me with jquery-ui
[04:53:27] <Cork> mindis|wurk: not really
[04:54:02] <Cork> ?ask @ aadios
[04:54:03] <bot-t1> aadios, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[05:01:05] <io__> I need a little help here http://pastebin.com/GSnK6yY5 how to call a jquery function when some dynamic content is laoded
[05:04:11] <Cork> io__: call a function?
[05:04:17] <Cork> just call it?
[05:05:03] <Cork> io__: your already listening for the callback when its loaded
[05:05:15] <kborchers> io__: just move $('.scroll-pane').jScrollPane(); inside your callback after $(this).fadeIn('slow');
[05:07:00] <io__> that s what i ve tried to do but it didn t work
[05:07:09] <io__> I ll check it again
[05:07:32] <Cork> io__: it might be that you want it to happen after the fade?
[05:07:51] <Cork> if so you need to use the fadeIn's callback
[05:09:12] <nFFF> Xotix, if you want to literally follow your mouse youll have the update the elements position
[05:09:26] <io__> Cork: it should be before, cause i need to load the content, apply the script, then fade in
[05:09:32] <nFFF> However the easiest way is to just have the popup static above the element
[05:09:53] <Xotix> nFFF i know. BUt maybe it's already done in ui and also, how would i do it in a good way?
[05:11:20] <nFFF> Xotix, do what the dynamic positioning?
[05:11:37] <Xotix> yes the updating of the pos
[05:16:22] <v_y> can i tell jquery ui to use a css class prefix other than ".ui-"?
[05:17:25] <kborchers> v_y: no
[05:17:56] <v_y> ugh.. it conflicts with an existing set of rules
[05:18:05] <v_y> i guess i can modify the js directly then?
[05:18:42] <nFFF> Xotix
[05:18:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Yv766/
[05:19:24] <Xotix> hmm i'll do it static
[05:19:24] <nFFF> Theres probably an easier solution :|
[05:19:33] <makinen> how can I select nth table cell even if it's been hidden by toggle()?
[05:19:51] <Xotix> but somehow i can't get my div to be positioned by top left etc.
[05:19:51] <kborchers> v_y: why not just change the conflicting css, then you don't have to worry about redoing your changes when you upgrade UI
[05:20:17] <makinen> $('td:eq(2)') selects a wrong cell if the 2nd is toggled
[05:20:26] <Xotix> got it….ups. Thanks a lot nFFF
[05:20:43] <nFFF> np
[05:21:14] <Transcended> Masters of jquery, I'm having trouble cancelling existing ajax requests... I posted the question on SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9533970/killing-previous-ajax-requests-before-new-one-is-sent
[05:22:03] <v_y> kborchers: it's not that easy to get the people i'm dealing with to go along with that
[05:22:06] <nFFF> Transcended, isn't it already answered? :P
[05:22:08] <v_y> w/e, i'll figure something out
[05:22:18] <Transcended> Ah, yes
[05:22:28] <Transcended> nFFF: Wow, can't believe it was that simple
[05:32:50] <Xotix> isnt there somethign like hasId?
[05:32:53] <soee> i have span inside li tag, now if i click on thi spoan how can i do something with ul tag thatg is placed after parent li element?
[05:33:21] <io__> Cork: i got it owrking th eproblem was because i had the same function called in another script
[05:33:41] <xec> Xotix: you want to check if an element has an id? see ?is
[05:33:41] <bot-t1> Xotix, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[05:33:41] <Larholm> so, el.closest("li").next("ul")
[05:33:57] <bartmax> how can I mimic a $('selector').live('focus', function(){}); using on ?
[05:34:09] <NoReGreT> claudio: what bootstrap ?
[05:34:16] <bartmax> i did $(document).on('focus', selector, function) is that ok ?
[05:34:27] <xec> bartmax: yes
[05:34:40] <bartmax> also, if I do $(document).one('focus', selector, function) <-- this executes more than ONE time
[05:34:47] <bartmax> see .one instead of .on
[05:35:21] <bartmax> I want a live one :) is that possible ?
[05:36:02] <xec> bartmax: does the selector match more than one element?
[05:36:04] <Cork> as far as i can tell that sounds like a bug
[05:36:08] <bartmax> xec: yes
[05:36:27] <xec> bartmax: any nesting going on?
[05:36:36] <bartmax> nope
[05:36:44] <bartmax> want a fidddle?
[05:36:48] <xec> please
[05:36:52] <xec> sounds strange
[05:37:01] <bartmax> one sec
[05:37:24] <xec> ok, i'm timing you
[05:37:27] <xec> one second is UP
[05:37:31] <xec> :D
[05:37:40] <xec> sorry, bored
[05:38:45] <diverdude> why are the jqueryui widgets so uncustomizable  :(
[05:39:30] <Cork> diverdude: they arn't
[05:39:41] <Cork> you customize then by extending then though
[05:39:57] <bartmax> xes: http://jsfiddle.net/wybre/
[05:40:26] <diverdude> Cork: forexample the accordion i cannot set a padding...and for some reason the default padding is very large
[05:40:49] <Cork> uh... thats just css
[05:41:04] <bartmax> xec:  still here ?
[05:41:10] <Cork> diverdude: just overide the css values with the value you want
[05:41:15] <bartmax> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/wybre/
[05:41:18] <bartmax> sorry wrong name before
[05:42:27] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/WsxqL/4/ if you hover over the msg which pops up, it blinks, why?
[05:43:40] <diverdude> Cork: which class do i override then to set a proper padding on this element? http://imagebin.org/201682
[05:43:56] <rworth> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/9tJew/
[05:45:20] <Cork> diverdude: .ui-accordion .ui-accordion-content { padding: 1px; }
[05:45:32] <bartmax> Xotix: because you hide the element so it's not that element anymore and it displays again
[05:45:42] <Xotix> rworth: this in apendTo is #editImgLayer right?
[05:45:59] <xec> bartmax: yes, that is strange - only works if it's attached directly http://jsfiddle.net/wybre/1/
[05:46:07] <rworth> the message needs to be a child so it doesn't cause a mouseleave, yes
[05:46:16] <Xotix> i hide it? i hide it when the mouse leaves which it didnt
[05:46:21] <bartmax> xec: but that will not work if i load it via ajax
[05:46:40] <Cork> bartmax: that sounds; and looks like a jquery bug to me; might be worth filing it
[05:46:47] <bartmax> ha! i want the I FOUND A BUG badge. ..
[05:47:05] <Cork> bartmax: that syntax is new for 1.7 so it might just be missed
[05:47:13] <bartmax> Cork: yup ...
[05:47:17] <Xotix> $(someting).appendTo(this); is this now the previouse selector?
[05:47:19] <bartmax> i wish ajpiano was here right now :D
[05:47:24] <Cork> lol
[05:47:25] <quicksilver> bartmax: looks like nobody tested it with the ",selector," version
[05:47:26] <quicksilver> doh.
[05:47:31] <Xotix> not the selector itself but the obj created out of it
[05:47:51] <Cork> bartmax: i can't spott any error in your code at least, so i find it liktly to be a framework bug
[05:47:52] <xec> bartmax: i agree with Cork, reading the docs and don't see anything that explains this behaviour. what you can do in the meantime is add a class or something to prevent it from happening more than once
[05:47:55] <diverdude> Cork: that makes no difference
[05:48:27] <bartmax> xec lets see with class
[05:48:43] <rworth> Xotix: this is the element to which the event is bound. $(something).appendTo(this) says take 'something' and add it as the last child of 'this'
[05:48:54] <bartmax> yup, with class works perfectly
[05:49:06] <bartmax> how can i fill the bug ?
[05:49:08] <bartmax> or where
[05:49:10] <Cork> diverdude: inspect your page with a css inspector (all browsers has a farly good one, expect posibly ie)
[05:49:22] <Cork> diverdude: it should be farly trivial to find what overides your css
[05:49:25] <Cork> gbg
[05:49:28] <Cork> Ä*gtg
[05:49:35] <xec> bartmax: bugs.jquery.com i think
[05:49:38] <bartmax> ty
[05:50:28] <Xotix> rworth: hmm, the obj jquery creates at mosueenter?so it needs to be a child. ok. but it doesn't get copied for each mouseenter right?
[05:50:50] <rworth> when you use appendTo and the target is a single element, it gets moved
[05:51:00] <rworth> if the target is a collection of elements it gets cloned
[05:51:12] <Xotix> ok godo thanks a lot
[05:51:14] <Xotix> *good
[05:51:18] <rworth> np
[05:52:14] <xec> bartmax: looks like its filed and fixed already http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11133
[05:52:52] <xec> no thats not quite the same
[05:53:13] <bartmax> xec: how do you explain this now: http://jsfiddle.net/wybre/2/
[05:53:50] <bartmax> it's working NOW!?!?! wtf ?
[05:54:05] <bartmax> nevermind my bad
[05:54:05] <bartmax> lol
[05:54:08] <xec> bartmax: thats the same as mine, as in not live
[05:54:14] <bartmax> jhahha yes sorry
[05:56:28] <xec> bartmax: this is what i meant by "adding a class or something" btw
[05:56:30] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/wybre/4/

[05:59:11] <xec> who is this Akismet guy!?
[05:59:26] <xec> someone should slap him in the face with a trout or something
[06:00:34] <xec> bartmax: maybe ask in #jquery-dev about bugreporting, might be someone able to help

[06:07:28] <anticom> hi all
[06:07:40] <anticom> i want to select all tr's inside a table without the first one
[06:07:46] <anticom> how do i do that properly?
[06:08:16] <anticom> find('tr:gt(1)') ??
[06:08:54] <yurakeshi> anticom: .find('tr:not(:first)')
[06:09:06] <yannickoo> hey guys, can anybody tell me how i can check whether this.href ends with .pdf?
[06:09:27] <nail_> if you use :gt() it would be :gt(0)
[06:10:38] <yurakeshi> Hi, i'm having problem with a slideDown effect in IE 8. The slide does occurr, but the parent height seems not to be updated, so the children doesn't display all content. This only happens in IE 8, all others browsers works perfect. The url: http://ejamundodotrabalho.homedns.org (click the 'Lista de Municipios' button)
[06:10:43] <nail_> but as it's stated in the doc, you might have better performance by using $('tr').slice(1)
[06:10:57] <Xotix> is there somethign like parent('td'); to get the next td?
[06:11:04] <Xotix> "clostest
[06:11:19] <yurakeshi> Xotix: .closest('td')
[06:11:36] <Xotix> nice thanks a lot!
[06:13:47] <yannickoo> äh kick ^ ?
[06:14:39] <yurakeshi> nail_: (this.href.lastIndexOf(".pdf") == this.href.length-4)
[06:16:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> hello guys, who can help me with some fancybox issue? :)
[06:19:04] <JackBauer24> iSeeDeadPixels: we can't, unless you tell us what the issue is
[06:19:35] <jeffreylevesque> i have jquery code that makes makes text bigger or smaller depending on the element clicked
[06:19:42] <jeffreylevesque> i think i may have a css problem in my code: http://jsfiddle.net/DDSyV/2/. THe following: '$('.container-1100-1').css('font-size', size);' doesn't get executed even though the variable size is well defined
[06:20:16] <yurakeshi>  Hi, i'm having problem with a slideDown effect in IE 8. The slide does occurr, but the parent height seems not to be updated, so the children doesn't display all content. This only happens in IE 8, all others browsers works perfect. The url: http://ejamundodotrabalho.homedns.org (click the 'Lista de Municipios' button)
[06:20:22] <jeffreylevesque> it doesn't seem to work in IE
[06:20:42] <iSeeDeadPixels> JackBauer24, it opens the fancybox on one page, but on another page it just opens the url....
[06:21:18] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://www.lucky4.nl/ "kopen" button opens the fancybox, http://www.lucky4.nl/webshop.html here it won't
[06:21:46] <yurakeshi> jeffreylevesque: it seems to be working on IE 9
[06:23:13] <jeffreylevesque> doesn't in IE8 for me
[06:23:38] <Xotix> rworth is there no other way? im also doing this for some img's and want ot to be over the image. the img is sorrounded by an td and other content i never know. So appending isn't that great. Can't i just make it static and stop the mosueenter to betriggered again until the mosueleave ets triggered and only by this element and not the layer?
[06:24:35] <rworth> you can check event.target in each event and decide whether or not to show/hide
[06:25:32] <iSeeDeadPixels> anyone able to help me with my issue?
[06:25:35] <JackBauer24> iSeeDeadPixels: you load products with ajax/javascript, you need to use fancyBox with live method
[06:25:38] <Xotix> How should that work? event.target  would always be the same like this
[06:25:55] <iSeeDeadPixels> JackBauer24, why does it work on one page but not on the other then?
[06:26:45] <JackBauer24> iSeeDeadPixels: on the first page data is loaded before initiation of fancybox listener
[06:27:43] <iSeeDeadPixels> hmmm..
[06:27:56] <iSeeDeadPixels> so, what do i need to change exactly?
[06:27:59] <rworth> Xotix: have a look at http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1805-jQuery-Events-MouseOver-MouseOut-vs-MouseEnter-MouseLeave.htm#comments_24216
[06:28:14] <Xotix> rworth: thanks you
[06:29:39] <JackBauer24> iSeeDeadPixels: use this: http://api.jquery.com/live/ . and btw. you don't have fancybox css file on webshop.html
[06:29:53] <iSeeDeadPixels> may that be the problem?
[06:29:55] <nFFF> No dont use live
[06:30:00] <nFFF> use ?on
[06:30:00] <bot-t1> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[06:30:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> the css file?
[06:30:31] <JackBauer24> iSeeDeadPixels: yes, you've got it on your index page but it's missing on webshop subpage
[06:30:49] <JackBauer24> fancybox will look like shit without it
[06:31:08] <iSeeDeadPixels> hmm, so, how do i exactly use that on method?
[06:31:17] <iSeeDeadPixels> really, i'm not good at jQuery lol
[06:31:32] <JackBauer24> just read the docs
[06:32:59] <iSeeDeadPixels> the docs don't answer my stupidity :(
[06:34:21] <thenior> hey all quick question: I'm trying to determine if $this element has a rel that beings with "other". $(this+'[rel^="other"]') doesn't seem to be the correct syntax
[06:35:51] <Edward123> hey, how can i escape some html so i can put it inside a <textarea>? http://jsfiddle.net/aGqVz/
[06:36:02] <JackBauer24> thenior: $('[rel^="other"]', this)
[06:37:31] <thenior> JackBauer24: any documentation on that? never seen that before...
[06:37:32] <thenior> thanks btw
[06:37:56] <Xotix> rworth: http://jsfiddle.net/9tJew/1/ is this okay?
[06:38:24] <Xotix> Or is it bad practice. Too hungry for performance maybe?
[06:38:48] <thenior> JackBauer24: so in theory, I could do if($('[rel^="other"]', this).length){//my stuff} to check if it exists...
[06:38:50] <JackBauer24> thenior: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/ 2nd parameter is "context"
[06:39:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> nFFF, could you perhaps show me the code i have to use, the docs didn't help me :C
[06:39:21] <thenior> JackBauer24: awesome thanks
[06:40:05] <rworth> Xotix: looks alright
[06:40:07] <JackBauer24> thenior: and yes, you can do it like this
[06:40:58] <Xotix> ok thanks a lot
[06:43:29] <jlebrech> how do you post to a url non-ajax?
[06:45:08] <diverdude> Cork: hello again. i was hoping you could help me with the last padding bit which i cannot seem to remove. You can see here where it is: http://imagebin.org/201686 (the right padding. Do you have any idea how i can remove that?
[06:48:35] <thenior> jlebrech: pretty confident that's impossible with javascript. You can only do a post to a url without non-ajax with server side code (php etc.)

[06:51:05] <angelazou> hello, I have a snippet that I need some help with
[06:51:07] <angelazou> http://jsfiddle.net/Yspdz/
[06:51:21] <angelazou> problem is, somehow, the slidetoggle won't work
[06:51:38] <angelazou> the entire list was suppose to be hidden until I click on the link at the first line
[06:51:44] <angelazou> to slide toggle open it
[06:52:56] <diverdude> Can anybody help me with the last padding bit which i cannot seem to remove. You can see here where it is: http://imagebin.org/201686 (the right padding). Do you have any idea how i can remove that?
[06:53:12] <Edward123> chaps i've seen some suggestions along these lines but they don't seem to be working: http://jsfiddle.net/aGqVz/2/
[06:53:34] <sandstrom> Can I bind/observe/debug/log all events happening on an event?
[06:53:50] <iSeeDeadPixels> nFFF, could you perhaps show me the code i have to use, the docs didn't help me :C
[06:53:53] <hazamonzo> hmm, how might i go about attaching (or selecting really) all the spans with this id inside this table? i think i want to get the table bu the id and use a .each to attach the click event? http://wstaw.org/m/2012/03/02/plasma-desktopQL3802.jpg
[06:56:25] <angelazou> umm...lots of us need help
[06:56:41] <Edward123> let's catalyse?
[06:56:58] <Edward123> ooo, utf8
[06:57:06] <ajpiano> hazamonzo: duplicate id's is invalid 100% of the time
[06:57:27] <hazamonzo> ajpiano: ahhh og course. should use a class instead for starters
[06:57:37] <hazamonzo> okay assume i use a class for the span :)
[06:58:05] <ajpiano> if you use a class, $(".dashboard_button").click(function() { });  will do the trick
[06:58:41] <hazamonzo> ajpiano: i see. thats what i had before and it was only working for the first span. makes sense since it was an id and not a class
[06:58:59] <ajpiano> yep, $("#foo") will only select the first #foo, regardless of how many elements you actually have with that id
[06:59:46] * hazamonzo man hugs ajpiano
[06:59:48] <hazamonzo> Cheers mate

[07:02:54] <nFFF> theres multiple ways to check if your target is the right element
[07:02:58] <nFFF> Im not sure which is the best
[07:02:59] <nFFF> :<
[07:03:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> nFF, how do i let the fancybox show with that method?
[07:03:19] <brettster> http://jsfiddle.net/Y7mBu/1/
[07:03:30] <brettster> someone gave me that script to sniff if the user was using chrome
[07:03:45] <brettster> but I'm more so looking to run a pop up window only if the user is using chrome
[07:04:13] <brettster> basically the client wants the site to show a popup if the user is using chrome - that tells them to install an RSS feed reader
[07:04:50] <majd> Hey #jquery - i a datepicker for my site, and that's pretty much the only part of jquery UI that i need
[07:04:55] <nFFF> iSeeDeadPixels :<
[07:05:14] <majd> what files should i include in my html for this to work?
[07:05:20] <Xotix> is it possible to show one image on different positions? like instances of them? without actually copy them?
[07:05:40] <brettster> anyone?
[07:06:15] <Xotix> majd you got dependencies on the ui page
[07:07:02] <aqeel> hi room
[07:07:34] <majd> Xotix, so i can't just include this: 	<script src="../ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js"></script>  after i include jquery?
[07:08:22] <Xotix> check on the datepickers doc what dependencies you got. jquery ui consists of several components. you don't need all of them to get the datepicekr working. you can choose which one are included in the download
[07:11:58] <thenior> jlebrech: So I got the code working, but in the context of what I'm doing, it doesn't work
[07:12:00] <thenior> any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/GYhLa/

[07:14:21] <aqeel> well all is well........but i want a for loop to see if there exist any loaded class within the div ...
[07:15:20] <aqeel> because hoveing over the li that does not have loaded will be taken into account
[07:16:17] <aqeel> any wanna help...thanks
[07:17:53] <iSeeDeadPixels> nFFF, don't you know it?
[07:18:13] <aqeel> anyone looking into my code/
[07:19:37] <ratty_> how would I use .load after an element, i.e. <fieldset id="activities"><legend>Title</legend> LOAD CONTENT HERE </fieldset>
[07:19:58] <thenior> aqeel: you don't have the html in there, makes it hard to follow
[07:20:21] <aqeel> well this is what must happen.....count all the li within the div and then increment through all and see if any has loaded class....if indeed it has thus load the submenu of relative menu link.....else just hides it...
[07:20:29] <aqeel> ok
[07:20:34] <aqeel> let me put that too
[07:20:58] <ratty_> so far I got $('fieldset#activities').load('/ajax/get-activities/'+venue);
[07:21:18] <ratty_> but I need this to load inside the fieldset and after the <legend>
[07:21:35] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/Z8pjB/1/
[07:21:49] <Rushing> anyone know why offset() is giving me 0 for a whole bunch of stuff in my page? i'm checking it on scroll, so i know it's not a visibility timing issue
[07:22:20] <aqeel> give your position an id or class and have it replaced with it.....ratty_
[07:22:43] <standard12> yo
[07:22:44] <aqeel> after legend and field with id or class u want it to load into
[07:23:01] <standard12> I'm having a conflict issue, I think, wondering if anyone can help?
[07:23:46] <standard12> http://smoothfinancial.co.uk/phase2development/ - this is the link if anyone is willing to help
[07:23:53] <aqeel> u can see whole picture at......jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html.........thenior
[07:24:09] <standard12> the conflict i'm getting is the youtube lightbox and the sliding down panel
[07:24:18] <standard12> I can get each to work individualyl but not at the same time
[07:24:47] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://www.lucky4.nl/ "kopen" button opens the fancybox, http://www.lucky4.nl/webshop.html here it won't, what is the problem, and how do i solve it?
[07:25:48] <Xotix> $('body').append('<img src="/resources/img/icon_edit.gif" class="editIconImg" />').css({left: pos.left, top: pos.top, position: 'absolute'}); How can i make the .css apply to the append?
[07:26:30] <nFFF> Xotix
[07:26:34] <nFFF> inline the css
[07:26:49] <aqeel> $('body').append('<img src="/resources/img/icon_edit.gif" class="editIconImg" />');
[07:27:20] <aqeel> $(".editIconImg")..css({left: pos.left, top: pos.top, position: 'absolute'});
[07:27:31] <Xotix> nFFF there are variables so such a solution is cleaner.
[07:27:38] <nFFF> $('body').append('<img src="/resources/img/icon_edit.gif" class="editIconImg" style="left:' + pos.left + '/>')
[07:27:39] <aqeel> one after the other....so it will have class and will then be loaded as well
[07:27:43] <Xotix> aqeel, that doesn't work. then i'll change all img's I'm in a loop
[07:27:49] <Rushing> my elements don't have any kind of positioning on them…i don't understand how "offset" is giving me nothing....
[07:28:29] <Rushing> and they are clearly not at the top of the page
[07:28:36] <aqeel> ok
[07:28:56] <Xotix> thanks
[07:29:01] <aqeel> any time
[07:29:25] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/Z8pjB/1/.................any one can help me with for loop
[07:30:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://www.lucky4.nl/ "kopen" button opens the fancybox, http://www.lucky4.nl/webshop.html here it won't, what is the problem, and how do i solve it?
[07:30:20] <aqeel> or any other way around...
[07:32:36] <Xotix> aqeel: what should thsi be? You can make a dropdown with css.
[07:33:02] <aqeel> yes but css has 2 states...this has 4 states..
[07:33:48] <aqeel> over not locked, over locked, over preview, out preview...
[07:33:50] <Xotix> you should choose jquery on jsfiddle
[07:34:20] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/Z8pjB/2/
[07:34:25] <Rushing> has anyone else had issues with offset() returning 0?
[07:34:33] <aqeel> sorry .grrrrrrrr everytime i miss that
[07:35:17] <aqeel> but to get the full picture i prefer u go to my site...
[07:35:34] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[07:37:29] <poppiez> is it possible to be notified when markup changes inside a div?
[07:37:41] <aqeel> yes use alert
[07:37:55] <poppiez> I mean when the change actually occurs
[07:38:00] <poppiez> was looking at DOMSubtreeModified
[07:38:22] <poppiez> but I don't think there's too much support for that
[07:39:21] <Xotix> aqeel you didn't call your functions. whats supposed to happen? poppiez you can make your own event/triggers if you know what will change your dom.
[07:40:08] <aqeel> ok....i am going to make new fiddle with everyhting in it....
[07:41:53] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/5gGdu/
[07:42:28] <aqeel> css part of fiddle is the external html file called into advance html which is under html
[07:43:31] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/5gGdu/1/
[07:44:46] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://www.lucky4.nl/ "kopen" button opens the fancybox, http://www.lucky4.nl/webshop.html here it won't, what is the problem, and how do i solve it?
[07:45:04] <Xotix> what could cause a wrong position();?
[07:45:49] <Xotix> aqeel and your question is?
[07:47:44] <aqeel> well xotix i just need one simple for loop to iterate through li which will look for loaded class on it and load its content into submenu
[07:48:04] <aqeel> well everything works....
[07:48:31] <aqeel> but after u hover over the other menu items it will go back to default ....
[07:52:02] <Xotix> aqeel camelCase your id's. and on my jsfiddle it doesn't work very nice. Why aare you checking for classes? Why not just use .click() and load the stuff in there?
[07:54:19] <aqeel> that is fine...but it is hover.. i am asking about
[07:55:55] <aqeel> after clicking u hover over will change contents
[07:57:35] <Xotix> i don't really get it with all that strange symbols
[07:58:12] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[07:59:44] <Xotix> The menu shouldn't disappear. use mouseenter on the element of "Menu" and hide it again on mouseloeave. mosueleave goes to the element which contains all the 12345
[08:00:32] <aqeel> no u click...will see locked...
[08:02:12] <Xotix> and if you click on a number the content which is shown at hover should stay?
[08:02:53] <K3|Chris|Work> is there a way to count how many divs are on one row if I'm floating an unknown bunch of them?
[08:03:32] <aqeel> no after clicking......sub menu stays.....but then when u hover over other item its gone
[08:05:49] <aqeel> under menu if u click 1 it stays but then when u hover over 2 under menu the contents are gone
[08:06:43] <brettster> http://jsfiddle.net/Y7mBu/2/
[08:06:43] <aqeel> u see mouse out....needs to find out if any li has "loaded " class on it
[08:06:49] <brettster> could someone please tell me whats wrong with that
[08:06:55] <brettster> it's only suppose to work in chrome
[08:07:01] <brettster> but it's working in all browsers
[08:08:14] <Xotix> aqeel sry i need to leave.< Can't investigate sry i couldn't help.
[08:08:26] <aqeel> thanks for your great time
[08:12:54] <artiintell_> hi... does anyone know how to draw 2 graphs in one plot
[08:13:03] <artiintell_> using Flot
[08:13:04] <artiintell_> ?
[08:13:05] <artiintell_> ???
[08:16:38] <yurakeshi> artiintell_, I'm using HighCharts and I'm pretty happy with it!
[08:18:19] <artiintell_> yurakeshi_ is it free soft
[08:18:23] <artiintell_> ?
[08:19:47] <artiintell_> and can I using this HighCharts draw processes in real-time?
[08:20:39] <yurakeshi> sure, it's pure JS, all drawing is done at run time.
[08:21:17] <yurakeshi> artiintell_, take a look at the demos: http://highcharts.com/demo/
[08:21:47] <snowfox> to answer your other question, it doesn't appear to be free
[08:22:15] <jonclark> if i'm loading third-party stuff into the dom from external scripts, but want to manipulate it after it lands in the dom, should i be using a timer to check for its existence?
[08:22:35] <jonclark> i remember using livequery for this purpose back in the 1.2 days
[08:23:43] <Edward123> chappy chaps i must be being a total dumbo, why can't i get the encoded html into the textarea? http://jsfiddle.net/aGqVz/2/
[08:24:09] <Edward123> jonclark: that's an excellent question, i'd like to know the answer to that myself
[08:25:28] <yurakeshi> artiintell_, it's open source
[08:28:33] <danheberden> jonclark define: third party
[08:28:39] <jonclark> share buttons, for instance
[08:30:03] <danheberden> if the script is manipulating the dom itself, you can use the domchange event if present and a timer as a fallback - if it's html/bigger you could do some iframe hackery of creating an iframe w/ content, and using the load and a domReady event on that
[08:30:07] <fris> what about (window).load(function()
[08:30:22] <danheberden> the latter obviously being crazy shinanegans more for sandboxing or something
[08:32:49] <jonclark> danheberden: some searching led me to darcy_clarke's http://darcyclarke.me/development/detect-attribute-changes-with-jquery/
[08:33:04] <jonclark> seems like a decent implementation, am i on the right track?
[08:33:26] <jonclark> except only detects attribute changes.. d'oh
[08:33:40] <fris> the loading thing maybe something like this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/4881982/555891
[08:33:50] <danheberden> i think the same cold be applied to a dommodified kind of thing, jonclark
[08:33:54] <danheberden> i think that's a good track
[08:36:46] <jonclark> thanks dan/fris
[08:38:54] <Edward123> fris: hrm so it looks like polling is still the way to go?
[08:40:30] <jonclark> Edward123, check out the link i posted, i think you can craft that plugin implementation to either act on dom events if supported or poll
[08:41:21] <jonclark> but i went with the quick and dirty right now that fris posted, modified slightly so it's tiny
[08:42:30] <brettster> anyone in here using chrome?
[08:43:37] <brettster> http://jsfiddle.net/Y7mBu/7/
[08:43:39] <brettster> this works
[08:43:45] <brettster> but once i implement it into my site
[08:43:50] <brettster> it doesnt work
[08:43:57] <brettster> http://broomerepublicans.com.s142783.gridserver.com/
[08:45:42] <brettster> nvm
[08:45:43] <brettster> got it
[08:45:43] <tom[]> hello, folks. Question: if i pass into jQuery() a set of jq objects, does it simply return them?
[08:47:10] <tom[]> iow, after doing a = $('a'); b = $(a); is b the same as a?
[08:47:45] <tomasm-> hi, how do I search for a script tag that has a certain file path in src? I am trying $('script[src=\/foo\/bar.js]') and it says unrecognized expression (also without the escape slashes)
[08:51:10] <dabear> tom[]: not the same
[08:51:14] <nachito> how can execute a function just once inside a setInterval
[08:51:33] <bronson> nachito: use setTImeout?
[08:52:34] <dabear> nachito: var isExecuted = false; setInterval( function(){   if(!isExecuted){  func(); isExecuted=true;  } /*other code*/  })
[08:52:51] <nachito> dabear: that might work, let me test that
[08:53:08] <dabear> and remember the second param too
[08:53:19] <yurakeshi> nachito, if you want to execute only one time it's better to use setTimeout
[08:54:10] <nachito> yurakeshi: it will execute many times, but just one call, makes sense?
[08:54:20] <Edward123> jonclark: ah ha, i only saw fris' link
[08:54:26] <Edward123> jonclark: interesting!
[08:54:31] <z3yo> Hi there
[08:54:45] <dabear> hell0§
[08:54:47] <dabear> !
[08:55:35] <yurakeshi> nachito, yes, but then it's not executing just once inside setInterval... so I didn't understand what you want. What's your scope?
[08:55:42] <z3yo> I've an autocomplete field (JQ.UI) and I want to get its value, So I tried with the change event but I can't get the new value, how can I do ?
[08:55:59] <nachito> yurakeshi: let me test dab ear code first, one min
[08:57:05] <yurakeshi> z3yo, inside the change event you can get the value with: ui.item.value
[08:57:57] <tom[]> dabear: i found it "When a jQuery object is passed to the $() function, a clone of the object is created. This new jQuery object references the same DOM elements as the initial one."
[08:58:05] <tom[]> so no, not the same. but similar
[08:59:10] <z3yo> yurakeshi, the problem is that I have two field a  textinput and a hidden field with the value, I need to get the hidden field's value
[09:00:42] <tomasm-> hi, does append() evaluate script tags in the code, or does it just place it in the dom? I place a script tag in after load and can't seem to find it again
[09:01:15] <dabear> tom[]: never ever will $() produce the "same" object, $("div")​ != $("div")
[09:01:54] <tom[]> ok
[09:02:03] <tom[]> tnx
[09:02:53] <shwaiil> hi
[09:02:58] <dabear> hola!
[09:04:13] <shwaiil> Q: I have many <div class="foo">, but just one is visible at each time. How to select foo based on its visible state ? Thanks
[09:04:42] <yurakeshi> z3yo, I didn't understand, please paste your code: http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:05:12] <shwaiil> $('.foo:visible') or something right ?
[09:06:01] <dabear> shwaiil: yes correct
[09:06:03] <alexr2> anyone know a good horizontal scroller that i can add and remove content from dynamically without issue?
[09:12:51] <fakingfantastic> Can someone please explain to me this syntax: modalContent.css({top: mdcTop + 'px', left: mdcLeft + 'px'}).hide()[animation](speed);  I've never seen that [animation](speed) thing before. How does that work?
[09:15:04] <DerekPioneer> running an each(), want to append(</div>) once the each is finished, the </div> ends up appending before the each() finishes though. http://jsfiddle.net/pZhkC/
[09:15:35] <Transcended> What is the standard for modal window plugins?  I need support for multiple modals on one page
[09:15:38] <alexr2> each is asynchronous, other things will run before it finishes
[09:16:04] <davidmurdoch> Transcended you don't like jQuery.ui.dialog?
[09:16:05] <dabear> fakingfantastic: var bar="hello"; $("div")[bar]() is the same as $(div).hello()
[09:16:11] <nachito> is there a way where I can use stop() animation with swing?
[09:16:26] <Transcended> davidmurdoch: Is that the one from jQuery Tools?
[09:16:39] <davidmurdoch> it is jQuery UI
[09:16:42] <DerekPioneer> alexr2: what would you do to make append end after the each()?
[09:16:46] <davidmurdoch> google it.
[09:16:51] <sweb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9537515/get-loaded-data-from-cross-domain-iframe-with-jquery
[09:16:57] <alexr2> use a regular for loop :-P
[09:17:00] <fakingfantastic> dabear: thanks bud
[09:17:11] <DerekPioneer> alexr2: word up
[09:17:23] <davidmurdoch> Anyone know if we can subscribe to $.fn.data change?
[09:17:59] <davidmurdoch> Something like: $("element").on("datachange", function(old, new){  });
[09:18:47] <dabear> davidmurdoch: yes, if you also load jquery ui
[09:19:21] <davidmurdoch> I am using jquery UI 1.8.18
[09:20:23] <dabear> think its called setdata and getdata
[09:20:28] <dabear> hang on gotta check
[09:21:49] <davidmurdoch> $.Observable ?
[09:22:01] <sweb> any idea guys ?
[09:22:37] <dabear> davidmurdoch: you don't need ui, and the events are getData and setData
[09:23:19] <dabear> these events wont work with data-properties on html dom elements though
[09:23:39] <davidmurdoch> $("element").each(function(){
[09:23:45] <davidmurdoch> gah. oops
[09:24:05] <davidmurdoch> I'm not seeing getData or setData in jQuery docs
[09:24:14] <davidmurdoch> just $.fn.data and $.data
[09:24:26] <dabear> search in here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.js
[09:24:43] <davidmurdoch> thanks
[09:24:46] <davidmurdoch> giving it a shot now
[09:27:09] <davidmurdoch> I love you. Any idea why this isn't documented?
[09:27:20] <davidmurdoch> dabear
[09:27:37] <dabear> yes
[09:27:43] <DerekPioneer> using a for statement, append() still appends before my for statement is finished
[09:27:44] <DerekPioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/pZhkC/1/
[09:27:53] <dabear> because it is not a feature you should rely on
[09:27:59] <dabear> i.e. it might disappear
[09:28:13] <dabear> so they don't wanna support it
[09:28:34] <davidmurdoch> thats what I was afraid of
[09:31:33] <microhxo> How can i make a div always in view as my footer when scrolling/
[09:31:34] <microhxo> ?
[09:31:54] <dabear> ?g position fixed css @ microhxo
[09:31:57] <davidmurdoch> dabear It really works great. You can't namespace the changeData event though. :-(
[09:32:06] <microhxo> dabear the window its in always moves?
[09:37:30] <dabear> microhxo: yeah
[09:43:35] <microhxo> dabear: position fixed makes my buttons appear outside of the window!!
[09:48:06] <aqeel> microhxo u need to specify the flow of your layout put all fixed div at end
[09:48:39] <microhxo> I did
[09:48:46] <microhxo> it floats outside of my window at the end
[09:48:53] <aqeel> fixed will break all barriers and go with screen
[09:49:12] <aqeel> do not float if it has fixed?
[09:49:48] <aqeel> float and position must be applied carefully
[09:50:19] <aqeel> only float can be used alone for layout ....or only position can be used for layout......
[09:50:39] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[09:50:48] <aqeel> all element s are posiitoned...
[09:51:19] <aqeel> u can adjust the screen and see the components for yourself
[09:51:39] <aqeel> min height and min width helps it in place for the center screen
[09:52:49] <aqeel> microhxo i can guide u if u have the layout
[09:54:42] <microhxo> http://paste2.org/p/1923153
[09:55:05] <microhxo> dynamichtml is injected with a jquery accordian of data..
[09:55:27] <Majicpanda> $.post("battle_functions.php", { attack_button: player_attack_ability}, function(data) { .... any way to change this so that i can return data but also in the php file return a specific variable like foo=bar and separate it out away from the "data" ?
[09:55:29] <z3yo> The autocompletechange event is gone now, right ?
[09:55:36] <microhxo> I need my buttons to stay at the bottom but floating so they are always assessable when scrolling.
[09:56:10] <Majicpanda> because what im doin is echo'ing a bunch of things in the php page and then appending that to a div, but i want to do something very specific with something that gets processed on the posted to page
[09:56:39] <microhxo> aqueel, does that code help?
[09:59:22] <aqeel> microhxo....if using float alwys use top,left,right,bottom..............for aligning
[09:59:38] <aqeel> this is trial and error ....then it will always stay put
[09:59:40] <microhxo> aqeel, ok ill try and get it.
[09:59:52] <microhxo> aqeel using margins right?
[10:00:18] <aqeel> float is margins............position is top,left,right,bottom
[10:00:19] <aqeel> yes
[10:01:57] <sweb> is not any way for my issue ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9537515/get-loaded-data-from-cross-domain-iframe-with-jquery

[10:04:30] <brettster> ?
[10:05:23] <Cccchris> Hello. I'm trying to check a radio button by ID in a callback function. I'm using $('#billing').attr('checked', true); For some reason, this doesn't work when inside the callback function but works fine outside. Any ideas? (I'm new to jQuery, apologies if I'm missing something obvious)
[10:05:54] <RandalSchwartz> Cccchris - are you sure you aren't mixing up .attr and .prop?
[10:05:58] <aqeel> put it as function
[10:06:10] <dabear> Cccchris: use .is(":checked")
[10:06:16] <RandalSchwartz> .attr is how it is in the source.  .prop is how it is "live"
[10:06:24] <Cccchris> RandalSchwartz: Not heard of prop before, I'll check it out thanks
[10:06:36] <Cccchris> dabear: thanks, will check it out
[10:06:42] <RandalSchwartz> in general, unless you're building HTML, ignore .attr
[10:06:59] <RandalSchwartz> I learned this the hard way a few months ago :)
[10:07:05] <Cccchris> :-)
[10:07:08] <brettster> ?
[10:07:09] <brettster> ?
[10:07:09] <brettster> ?
[10:07:15] <aqeel> ok guys how to do li loop for searching for 'loaded' class
[10:07:28] <Edward123> ah, RandalSchwartz, awesomeness to the maximum
[10:08:49] <eddiemonge> aqeel: $('li.loaded')
[10:09:17] <aqeel> that is selector.....
[10:09:54] <eddiemonge> yes .....
[10:09:58] <aqeel> for (i=0,i<id .length,i++){loop}
[10:10:19] <eddiemonge> perhaps your question wasnt too clear
[10:10:41] <dabear> aqeel: so, as I understand it, you want to be notified when a new li is added to the page with that class?
[10:10:48] <RandalSchwartz> why are you looping? :)
[10:11:46] <aqeel> say i have 5 li and when one of them is clicked has a class loaded added to it......now when i mouse out from other li....it must show content from the li clicked
[10:12:22] <aqeel> so only after loop i can see which li has loaded class on it
[10:12:33] <eddiemonge> why are you looping? :)
[10:12:58] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - that's $('li.loaded')
[10:13:07] <RandalSchwartz> that's the set of <li> that have class="loaded"
[10:13:10] <RandalSchwartz> no need to loop
[10:13:33] <Majicpanda> can you return both json encoded valueslike data.item_id, data.foo.. but also return data in an ajax call at the same time so it's easier to process?
[10:13:55] <eddiemonge> i feel like we are going in loops here
[10:14:03] <RandalSchwartz> is this where I came in? :)
[10:14:28] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: say what? your ajax should be retuning json if its data in an array like fashion
[10:14:37] <aqeel> yes but if i hover out from other li element which does bot have class how do i check that
[10:14:40] <eddiemonge> i think its where i came in
[10:17:16] <eddiemonge> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/LjNHX/
[10:17:24] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/PLtGj/
[10:18:43] <eddiemonge> $(linkID).siblings(".loaded")
[10:18:52] <aqeel> well that is single click..........i have made it double, hover and clicked....on same button properties
[10:19:02] <eddiemonge> $(linkID).siblings(".loaded")
[10:21:14] <Majicpanda> what has to be on the php page to return a jquery ajax post with json?
[10:22:03] <Majicpanda> $.post("battle_functions.php", { attack_button: player_attack_ability}, function(data) { ...  how do you store return values for data? so i can do data.foo, data.bar
[10:24:06] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: are you talking about what does the php have to do to send back json data? json_encode
[10:24:39] <eddiemonge> $.post(url, dataToSend, callbackFunction(dataReceivedFromServer), "json")
[10:27:29] <z3yo> Someone knows how to solve this bug ; http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6015 ?
[10:29:22] <kborchers> z3yo: since that bug was closed as invalid with an explanation of why it's invalid ... it has been solved
[10:29:58] <JonathanNeal> yeap :D
[10:30:16] <z3yo> kborchers, autocompletechange is the solution ?
[10:30:59] <kborchers> z3yo: looks that way see ?tias
[10:31:00] <bot-t> z3yo, Try It And See
[10:31:14] <z3yo> I thought this event was gone ?
[10:31:18] <_markh_> I have a textarea and have added a blur() handler. In the handler, if the data entered doesn;t look good, I select the offending bit and the call focus(). However if I blur by clicking on my app window (outside the textarea), focus doesn't return to the textarea (I don't know where it is). If I click on another app window altogether (thus blurring) all is well. I have tried calling event.preventDe
[10:31:19] <_markh_> fault() and/or returning false/true in my handler. Nothing seems to make any difference. The selection code works fine is I assign the func to a keyUp event. FF and chrome both behave the same.
[10:31:44] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/aGxXy/1/
[10:32:15] <kborchers> z3yo: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[10:32:24] <kborchers> check out events
[10:32:24] <Transcended> How do I go about delegating tasks on dynamic content loaded into a modal window, such as hiding an elemtn?
[10:32:26] <Transcended> element*
[10:32:40] <aqeel> u see if i use your code it will select on that element speciifed.....but does not have the class....so loop is prominenet or i need to change the end.....function calling 5 links?
[10:32:55] <aqeel> mainmenulink(".link1", "#link1");     mainmenulink(".link2", "#link2");     mainmenulink(".link3", "#link3");     mainmenulink(".link4", "#link4");     mainmenulink(".link5", "#link5");?
[10:33:52] <aqeel> now suppose i have loaded class on link2, after hovering out from link 5 must show me content of link 2
[10:33:56] <z3yo> kborchers, Ok, autocompletechange is still availaible, but it doesn't work, only change do something ?
[10:33:56] <Transcended> For instance:  I am loading an element called #new_list_box into a modal window, and I want it hidden, using  $('#new_list_box').hide(); in the ajax success handler doesn't work
[10:34:48] <kborchers> z3yo: are you using .on("autocompletechange", function().....
[10:34:53] <Cccchris> RandalSchwartz: hey, sorry to be a pain. I've changed attr to prop, but still having problems. When its in the callback like the following, it doesn't work, but when outside it works fine. Any ideas?! $.post("check_updates.php", function(data) { $('#billing').prop('checked', true); });
[10:35:11] <z3yo> kborchers, yeah
[10:35:30] <kborchers> ?demo @ z3yo
[10:35:30] <bot-t> z3yo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:35:56] <Majicpanda> eddiemonge: <?php echo json_encode(array("combat_log"=>"Hi","player_hp"=>"5","mob_hp"=>"1")); ?>
[10:36:06] <Majicpanda> if i do data.combat_log it doesnt display anything
[10:41:55] <imanc> hey can anyone recommend a decent js templating lib?
[10:42:21] <imanc> that isn't underscore, mustache or jquery tmpl
[10:42:28] <kborchers> imanc: handlebars.js
[10:42:41] <imanc> aha
[10:42:57] <imanc> ah, I need something other than {{}} as tag delimiters
[10:50:23] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: have you tried console.log(data) to see whats in there?
[10:50:50] <eddiemonge> kborchers: isnt handlebars mustache extended?
[10:50:53] <eddiemonge> imanc: why?
[10:51:13] <imanc> they clash with django's template tags and there's no way to escape 'em in django
[10:51:44] <imanc> and jquery-tmpl is doing seriously weird things in IE8
[10:52:13] <kborchers> eddiemonge: basically, yeah
[10:53:01] <eddiemonge> imanc: thats why your js should be in external files
[10:53:44] <imanc> eddiemonge: Yep, I'll do that … actually
[10:53:47] <imanc> cheers
[10:59:41] <kborchers> imanc: sorry, i knew it could do it but took a minute to find the doc http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template underscore lets you change the delimiters if you want to go that route
[11:01:02] <kborchers> imanc: check out http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template
[11:01:29] <muzone> Which do y'all prefer, <!--[if lt IE 9]><script src="https://raw.github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/master/src/html5shiv.js"></script> or <!--[if lt IE 9]><script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>?
[11:01:40] <kevindougans> i'm having some problems with $('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/<?= $page_css ?>/mobile.css" type="text/css" />');
[11:01:53] <kevindougans> can anyone else recommend any other ways to include a style sheet with jquery
[11:02:38] <eddiemonge> muzone: i prefer <!--[if lt IE 9]>DIE IE DIE-->
[11:03:06] <eddiemonge> kevindougans: i dont think that php should be there
[11:03:11] <imanc> kborchers: underscore is probably teh way fwd, thanks
[11:03:22] <eddiemonge> and if it is php, why not include the page when its built?
[11:03:32] <kborchers> oh, you saw my messages?
[11:03:38] <kborchers> wasn't showing up for me
[11:03:40] <kborchers> weird
[11:04:00] <kevindougans> eddiemonge: the php bit works fine actually, the problem is more the order in which append adds the style sheet and its contents
[11:04:29] <kevindougans> but eddiemonge you've gave me an idea form what you said so i'll try it thanks
[11:05:29] <muzone> eddiemonge: heheh
[11:06:37] <Edward123> hrm i think i just accidently learned something new about .each vs not .each and closures
[11:08:18] <Edward123> hrrrm, nope, didn't learn anything heh
[11:08:22] <eddiemonge> what? that people use each of the .each wrongly a lot of the times?
[11:09:48] <Edward123> eddiemonge: not that, i was using .each in something (needlessly, as it happens) - but i was getting weird results. was just trying to replicate in jsfiddle so i can explain, but i can't even replicate the issue heh
[11:14:00] <Edward123> eddiemonge: i was getting the behaviour, essentially, where whatever element you clicked you'd be seeing 'cornholio': http://jsfiddle.net/u5bmc/1/
[11:14:11] <Edward123> although even with the pointless each here that doesn't happen
[11:15:09] <eddiemonge> why are you preventingDefault in a each? there is no default there
[11:15:41] <Edward123> eddiemonge: typo: http://jsfiddle.net/u5bmc/2/
[11:16:44] <eddiemonge> and the reason the text was always the same was that each element had three event handlers bound to it, and since cornholio is the last element, that is the one that got the text
[11:17:22] <Edward123> eddiemonge: i don't get why each element had 3 event handlers?
[11:17:24] <eddiemonge> although, that last example is working correctly so nevermind
[11:17:40] <Edward123> heh
[11:18:31] <chris_w> Hi, is there way I can 'swap' functions bound to an event?
[11:19:04] <eddiemonge> Edward123: so its basically an inefficient version of http://jsfiddle.net/u5bmc/3/
[11:19:15] <eddiemonge> chris_w: swap how, which?
[11:20:03] <chris_w> well, if I  have a function I need on an event 99% of the time,  but for one case I need something else to happen on that event,
[11:20:16] <chris_w> ... I'm not sure if I'm even thinking the right way about this!
[11:20:22] <chris_w> grr not enough coffee
[11:20:57] <sam113101> provide an example
[11:21:03] <Edward123> eddiemonge: yeah, except for the weird behaviour - probably unrelated, probably down to a daft oversight that somehow i cleaned up when i got read of the meaningless each
[11:21:21] <chris_w> I'll start at the start - I'm using JQM for a project, and I've a function bound to the leftswipe event that takes the user to the correct place (this is set progmatticlly).   For one page, in one instance, I need to overrule this and do something else
[11:21:50] <chris_w> so I'm thinking, grab what's currently bound to the leftswipe event and replace it on pagebeforeshow
[11:22:01] <chris_w> and then restore it to what it as on pagehide
[11:22:17] <raj> eddiemonge, can you tell  me when you have a moment?
[11:22:27] <chris_w> then I don't have to backtrack to try to work out what was bound to the leftswipe event before I started
[11:22:38] <chris_w> (or re-create it I should say)
[11:22:56] <raj> I'm unable to figure out what's happening to my elements
[11:23:25] <chris_w> I'm sure if I can find a way of getting a function that's bound to the 'swipeleft' event I can work out the rest, so maybe that's where I should start
[11:26:47] <chris_w> is there a way  I can get the function(s) bound to an event?
[11:27:00] <rhodesjason> I've been ramming my head against a really simple problem all day and I'm about to blow my brains out
[11:27:02] * rhodesjason on the edge
[11:27:43] <rhodesjason> I want jQuery to intercept a link to an image, load the image onto the page, but figure out the width and height of the image so I can adjust them to fit on the screen
[11:27:53] <rhodesjason> I've done this before many times
[11:28:13] <rhodesjason> but today, when I try to determine width and height, every once in a while it returns 0 and 0, and I have no idea why
[11:28:47] <eddiemonge> because its not loaded yet
[11:29:53] <raj> eddiemonge, can you tell me why jstree is hiding the contents of my tree? http://68.46.138.78:8080/test
[11:30:45] <eddiemonge> raj: probably not since ive never used it
[11:31:03] <DerekPioneer> dumb question but i'm having trouble getting google to help me. how do i pull the first value out of a json object? var fxgMap = { "magnet_color_artboard_1":{
[11:31:24] <raj> ok, so nothing hits you from just looking at my html?
[11:32:59] <chris_w> I think I've got it, will report back if it works...
[11:36:36] <eddiemonge> raj:  you mean besides the fact there is no data
[11:36:47] <raj> eddiemonge, there is data
[11:36:52] <raj> you can even see it before the script loads
[11:37:41] <eddiemonge> raj:  but not after. look at the inspector
[11:37:48] <raj> eddiemonge, i see that
[11:37:53] <raj> i don't know what it does with it
[11:38:00] <eddiemonge> replaces it with nothing
[11:38:39] <raj> why? :)
[11:39:41] <chris_w> for those who care, here's how I've done it.  There may be a quicker way, but I don't know what it is..
[11:39:41] <chris_w>    var originalSwipe = $(window).data('events').swiperight[0].handler;
[11:39:41] <chris_w>     $(window).unbind('swiperight');
[11:39:41] <chris_w>     $(window).bind('swiperight', function(){
[11:39:41] <chris_w>         history.back();
[11:39:42] <chris_w>         $('#eventResultDetails').live('pagehide', function(){
[11:39:44] <chris_w>             $(window).unbind('swiperight');
[11:39:46] <chris_w>             $(window).bind('swiperight', originalSwipe);
[11:39:47] <jedimind> ....
[11:39:48] <chris_w>         })
[11:39:50] <chris_w>     });
[11:39:52] <jedimind> are you retarded?
[11:40:03] <sam113101> use pastebin please
[11:40:07] <chris_w> sry
[11:40:18] <sam113101> or jsfiddle
[11:40:35] <eddiemonge> dont use pastebin
[11:40:37] <eddiemonge> like ever
[11:40:43] <eddiemonge> its the worstest
[11:41:06] <eddiemonge> chris_w: you should chain your stuff together
[11:41:26] <eddiemonge> chris_w: and not use .live()
[11:41:31] <chris_w> eddiemonge, JQuery is rather new to me, so I know there's loads of stuff I'm not doing right
[11:41:51] <chris_w> I'm at the 'hack it until it works' stage with JQuery I'm afraid
[11:42:10] <prgmctan> is there a channel for jqueryui or should I just ask here?
[11:42:12] <chris_w> why not use live() ?
[11:42:19] <eddiemonge> because its deprecated
[11:42:42] <rhodesjason> eddiemonge: how can you reliably load hidden images so you can test their height/width before revealing them elegantly?
[11:42:49] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ prgmctan
[11:42:50] <bot-t> prgmctan, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:43:02] <chris_w> eddiemonge, wonder where the hell I got that from then
[11:43:03] <eddiemonge> rhodesjason: load them offscreen but still in the dom
[11:43:15] <prgmctan> eddiemonge: I was asking if there was a channel dedicated to jqueryui
[11:43:24] <eddiemonge> chris_w: from the jqm tutorial you were following
[11:43:40] <eddiemonge> prgmctan: i know. thats why i said to ask
[11:43:49] <chris_w> eddiemonge, that would be the most likely place, yes
[11:44:03] <rhodesjason> eddiemonge: if I load them offscreen with JS -- how do I know when they are all loaded so that the calculations work?
[11:44:31] <prgmctan> anyway, I'm using the jqueryui autocomplete and I'd like to trigger a blank search on focus
[11:44:44] <prgmctan> to return everything
[11:44:44] <chris_w> so .on() then
[11:44:48] <eddiemonge> ?load @ rhodesjason
[11:44:48] <bot-t> rhodesjason, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[11:46:35] <eddiemonge> ? on delegation @ chris_w
[11:46:35] <bot-t> chris_w, The new .on() method supports delegated events as well. Read up on it at http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:47:15] <eddiemonge> prgmctan: minLength: 0
[11:50:07] <eddiemonge> miketaylr: gets very confusing fast
[11:50:31] <miketaylr> >_<
[11:53:16] <tw2113> stop confusing people miketaylr
[11:53:21] <chris_w> Chained events run in the order that they are read (i.e. left-to-right), is that correct?
[11:53:34] <nachito> So I have this $('.logo ul li'), how can I select the 4th li in position
[11:53:54] <gehsekky> nachito: $():eq(3)
[11:53:55] <eddiemonge> chris_w: right
[11:53:59] <chris_w> thanks

[11:54:13] <nachito> thanks eddiemonge
[11:54:27] <shennyg> It looks like it has to do with the results being longer than the visible window.
[11:54:55] <shennyg> and the default looks fine: https://img.skitch.com/20120302-jxks8y7gj9fe7etn6gyft7iiyi.jpg
[11:54:59] <eddiemonge> shennyg: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-position
[11:55:50] <shennyg> eddiemonge: Is there a specific option I have to (un)set to make it now jump around?
[11:56:49] <eddiemonge> shennyg: by default, it goes where it will fit
[11:57:12] <shennyg> ok, so I need to position it absolutely.
[11:57:57] <shennyg> ahh collision, I'll look into that! thanks eddiemonge
[11:58:07] <eddiemonge> then use that position option
[11:58:19] <Majicpanda> http://pastebin.com/njwbLcJ5  <- can someoe look at that real quick and tell me why alert doesnt even seem to be happening? I'd think i would at least get an alert with an empty box
[11:59:27] <shennyg> eddiemonge: that worked! thanks a lot! have a good weekend.
[11:59:30] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ Majicpanda
[11:59:31] <bot-t> Majicpanda, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[12:00:22] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: try data["combat_log"]
[12:00:42] <eddiemonge> and it would help to see what console.log( data ) shows
[12:02:40] <Majicpanda> its not doing any cosole output
[12:03:02] <Majicpanda> if i put alert("TEST") it doesnt even alert that, if i dont even include data
[12:03:11] <eddiemonge> then you arent getting a response
[12:03:24] <eddiemonge> what does your network tab say about the response
[12:03:25] <Majicpanda> it worked before i put that json_encode line in
[12:03:54] <Majicpanda> method post, status ok
[12:04:05] <Majicpanda> 0 errors or warnings
[12:04:17] <jita> What should i use for modal window form submission? I have 2 forms in a single page, hence 2 different modal windows
[12:04:25] <jita> anything simple than jquery UI dialog ?
[12:04:46] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: visit the PHP directly and see what it outputs
[12:05:14] <eddiemonge> jita: i like the jqui one
[12:05:16] <Majicpanda> if i remove the ,"json" the data works
[12:05:23] <Majicpanda> its when i put that back in it fails to return anything
[12:05:44] <Majicpanda> doesnt see im encoding the json right on the php side
[12:05:47] <Majicpanda> seem
[12:06:10] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: like i said, visit the php page directly in your browser and see what it is doing. http://jsonlint.com
[12:06:19] <jita> eddiemonge, juery ui ?
[12:06:23] <eddiemonge> jita: yes
[12:07:17] <jita> ok thanks
[12:08:04] <martco> i'm setting $.ajax type: 'DELETE' but chrome is showing that i'm sending a 'OPTIONS' request type
[12:08:09] <martco> anyone have this problem?
[12:08:19] <mosdef100200> hi there im trying to get my box to animate to the left after say 10 seconds anyone have any ideas on the script to do this?
[12:09:24] <Majicpanda> says its valid json
[12:09:26] <jonclark> mosdef100200: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/109086/stop-setinterval-call-in-javascript
[12:09:59] <devinrolsen> setTimeout(function(){$(SOME ELEMENT).animate({left:SOMENUMBERpx})},10000); mosdef100200
[12:10:25] <Majicpanda> on the php side?
[12:10:32] <mosdef100200> Hey thanks so much!
[12:11:04] <chris_w> I've a problem here, looking at refactoring to remove the .live()'s from my code
[12:11:18] <devinrolsen> k
[12:11:54] <Majicpanda> eddiemonge: if its valid json it should be accessible with the data object right? console.log(data) should write something
[12:11:58] <eddiemonge> martco: did you read the "type" section in the docs?
[12:12:04] <martco> yeah
[12:12:13] <martco> said there were some issues with certain browsers
[12:12:18] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: yes
[12:12:26] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: live link?
[12:12:31] <martco> @eddiemonge i googled but could not find why chrome wouldn't at least work
[12:12:35] <chris_w> $('#something').live('pagebeforehide', function(){ /* blah /*});  gets triggered, while $('#something').on('pagebeforehide', function(){ /* blah /*});  doesn't.  From what I'm reading it should.   I know it's Friday, so I'm guessing it's something silly but I just can't see it
[12:12:36] <eddiemonge> martco: certain being most
[12:12:49] <Majicpanda> cant unfortunately
[12:12:57] <martco> eddiemonge: wow even chrome?
[12:13:30] <eddiemonge> martco: possibly.
[12:13:38] <Majicpanda> eddiemonge: any thoughts on why console.log("test") wont even work? its like its posting but completely failing to return
[12:14:03] <gehsekky> chris_w: (document).on('pagebeforehide', '#something', function() {})
[12:14:11] <eddiemonge> Majicpanda: do $.post(....).error(function(a,b,c) { console.log("Failed", a,b,c); });
[12:14:51] <chris_w> hmmm
[12:15:02] <devinrolsen> chris_w, might not be help full, but I'm starting to no longer explicitly declare .click or .live events one by one anymore.
[12:15:03] <devinrolsen> http://jsfiddle.net/ZWWZg/1/
[12:15:10] <devinrolsen> but rather replace them with a global even listener.
[12:15:25] <devinrolsen> just an alternative approach..
[12:15:55] <chris_w> devinrolsen, that's an interesting idea
[12:16:16] <chris_w> gehsekky, how come the examples in the docu are all of the 'older' format ?
[12:16:27] <gehsekky> i'm not really sure
[12:16:31] <chris_w> hmmm
[12:16:35] <gehsekky> but i've just had to do the same thing you're doing
[12:16:42] <Majicpanda> no console or alerts are coming back if i try to post to that php page
[12:16:45] <gehsekky> and .live is bound to the document object
[12:16:55] <gehsekky> so .on just makes that more apparent
[12:17:23] <chris_w> nearly all the examples in http://api.jquery.com/on/  are of $('something').on('event', function(){ /* blah */})
[12:17:25] <rbennion> Can someone help me with a quick selector question?
[12:17:50] <devinrolsen> just ask rbennion, if someone is able to do so, they will :)
[12:18:41] <gehsekky> chris_w: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[12:18:50] <gehsekky> this has some better 1:1 examples
[12:19:05] <rbennion> I have three <div> with the same class. They each contain an h3 with a different value. I want to select the <div> based on the h3 value and add a class to the div to  style it. I know how to add a class using jquery, but can't figure out how to select the div.
[12:19:16] <lenswipe> hey guys
[12:19:17] <bot-t> (44 hours 7 mins ago) <eddiemonge> tell lenswipe your code could be cleaned up greatly. heres a start: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/2/ learn about jQuery chaining and not appending in loops and lots of appends as it causes a reflow on each append
[12:19:52] <jonclark> rbennion: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[12:19:55] <devinrolsen> rbennion, you condition the h3's copy.
[12:19:55] <aghouseh> anyone know if its possible to use a variable for a property name? eg.. var name = 'height'; echo dimensions.{name};
[12:20:04] <devinrolsen> contains or even text() will work.
[12:20:08] <Majicpanda> ok i got it to work by itself so what else on my php page would throw off the return? can i not have echo anywhere on my php page at all?
[12:20:38] <jonclark> aghouseh, i think dimensions[name] should work in that case
[12:20:45] <jonclark> but i could be wrong
[12:20:54] <chris_w> thanks gehsekky
[12:20:58] <aghouseh> no go
[12:21:08] <jonclark> ah sry :(
[12:21:09] <chris_w> gehsekky, very useful
[12:21:46] <aghouseh> thx tho :)
[12:21:58] <devinrolsen> wait echo?
[12:22:01] <devinrolsen> this is not php man.
[12:22:40] <aghouseh> oh, right yea
[12:22:47] <aghouseh> im going back and forth, btu you know the concept :p
[12:22:57] <devinrolsen> ah hehe
[12:23:02] <devinrolsen> long as your JS doest not have echo.
[12:23:04] <devinrolsen> hehe
[12:23:05] <aghouseh> nah
[12:23:19] <devinrolsen> dimensions[0].name?
[12:23:28] <rbennion> So I use this: jQuery("div:contains('skills')").css("text-decoration", "underline"); but I need to tell it that the div ALSO needs to have the class 'item-list' . I seem to be stuck on how to add more than one requirement to the selector.
[12:23:59] <devinrolsen> jQuery("div h3:contains('skills')").parent().css("text-decoration", "underline"); rbennion
[12:23:59] <aghouseh> well, that was just an example, im actually trying to fill out a form from a query string that's been converted to JSON
[12:23:59] <jonclark> rbennion, "div.item-list:contains('skills')"
[12:25:07] <aghouseh> http://pastie.org/3506593
[12:25:09] <lenswipe> can someone help out with some js i have?
[12:25:44] <lenswipe> eddiemonge corrected my js to something that was more efficient but its producing an "Unexpected Token ILLEGAL" error and highlighting the closing brace of my script
[12:25:52] <martco> eddiemonge: i think chrome's doing a pre-flight to ask the server if it accepts DELETE
[12:25:52] <lenswipe> can someone take a look if a throw up a jsfiddle?
[12:26:02] <devinrolsen> aghouseh, are you positive it is an object array?
[12:26:08] <aghouseh> yea
[12:26:17] <aghouseh> hm
[12:26:21] <aghouseh> maybe no! let me verify :p
[12:26:23] <martco> eddiemonge: and the type of that request is OPTIONS
[12:26:29] <devinrolsen> do a console.log(typeof loadData)'
[12:26:37] <devinrolsen> console.log(typeof loadData);*
[12:27:04] <aghouseh> heh
[12:27:18] <devinrolsen> string?
[12:27:24] <devinrolsen> undefined?
[12:27:36] <aghouseh> string
[12:27:39] <devinrolsen> ok
[12:27:42] <devinrolsen> use eval on that sucker
[12:27:46] <aghouseh> eval! :o
[12:27:55] <devinrolsen> just as a test
[12:28:37] <devinrolsen> loadData = eval('(' + loadData + ')')
[12:28:48] <devinrolsen> then do a typeof check.
[12:29:05] <devinrolsen> should be an object that you can travers without the { }
[12:29:10] <nocturne7> http://pastebin.com/ryWkjeTe I have this code,  it is calling the back-end function asynchronously multiple times when it really shoult only be calling it once
[12:29:27] <nocturne7> am I making a mistake regarding the use of $.get ?
[12:29:37] <aghouseh> hm
[12:30:15] <aghouseh> well i have control of how its coming in
[12:30:22] <aghouseh> its a query string dumped into a db. im outputting it via php
[12:30:30] <aghouseh> and i had done json_encode on it
[12:30:37] <aghouseh> but atually, that doesnt make sense
[12:30:45] <devinrolsen> :)
[12:30:45] <aghouseh> because i have to unserialize THEN json_encode ok
[12:30:53] <aghouseh> sometimes you just need to talk it out, ya know? :{)
[12:31:00] <devinrolsen> yes sir I do.
[12:31:27] <aghouseh> ok cool
[12:32:33] <aghouseh> ok so now i have an object, but i still dont know how to access a propertys value based on a variable
[12:33:13] <aghouseh> im iterating the form with each and grabbing the id of the current element, and trying to access the value of loadData.{id} basically
[12:33:30] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/MEQpK/1/
[12:33:52] <aghouseh> mootools
[12:33:54] <devinrolsen> can you post the object?
[12:33:57] <aghouseh> yea sec
[12:37:01] <rbennion> So I tried jQuery("div.item-list h3:contains('skills')").css("text-decoration", "underline"); and it won't select anything. Something wrong with syntax?
[12:37:16] <chris_w> Can you chain unbinds as well? $(window).unbind('click').unbind('scroll'); for example?
[12:37:31] <aghouseh> too much of a pain, actually.. its got a bunch of personal info ive filled out .. anyway its just a form serialized and then unserialized and json'd
[12:37:43] <erichynds> chris_w: yes, but you can also do $(window).unbind("click scroll")
[12:37:53] <aghouseh> so its got like loadData.first, loadData.gender etc
[12:37:55] <chris_w> Ahh I did look for that in the docu but didn't see it
[12:38:15] <devinrolsen> yes
[12:38:16] <someprimetime> anyone know why i can' tdo this? http://jsfiddle.net/Hu2Ya/
[12:38:57] <someprimetime> the 2nd input selector parameter
[12:39:33] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: That syntax is trying to use $('input[name=item_type]') as a context for what comes before.
[12:40:08] <someprimetime> warrenparsons: would it be possible to select 2 different inputs within $form.closest('form') then?
[12:40:23] <ezio> is there any way to set some post variables for .getjson?
[12:41:01] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: This is probably what you want http://jsfiddle.net/Hu2Ya/1/
[12:41:22] <aghouseh> devinrolsen: i got it.. im dumb. i just had to do loadData[id] .. i mistakenly tried loadData.[id]
[12:41:47] <devinrolsen> yeah, if you don't have it as a multilevel object, that works ;)
[12:41:54] <devinrolsen> main reason I wanted to see it actully.
[12:42:03] <someprimetime> warrenparsons: sick thanks bro
[12:42:24] <warrenparsons> Looking for some opinions on script loaders. Looks like there's a ton of choices, and I'm hoping someone can distill it down to the top 2 or 3 options.
[12:42:43] <warrenparsons> Require.js looks well-supported.
[12:43:09] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: Did that work?
[12:45:58] <__composern> i want to ask about jquery datatables plugin.
[12:46:29] <devinrolsen> ok, I think you should ask about datatables plugins.
[12:47:33] <__composern> i have a coloum name id  when user types in searchbox i want to get first row data
[12:47:47] <devinrolsen> your looking for autocomplete
[12:47:52] <devinrolsen> that is your keyword.
[12:48:07] <__composern> devinrolsen:  autocomplate using json object
[12:48:22] <__composern> datatables using <table></table> tag
[12:49:15] <devinrolsen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6074723/how-can-i-display-jquery-autocomplete-results-in-a-table-rather-than-a-ul
[12:49:27] <devinrolsen> should get you started.
[12:51:10] <ezio> once every hundred million years or so when the wind doth blow, and the moon doth glow, and the grass doth grow
[12:51:29] <warrenparsons> Does anyone have an opinion on script loaders? I'm just looking for opinions. Which ones do you like?
[12:55:49] <imanc> if I have  var  x = "loads of html";       How can I use jquery to manipulate x?  In particular I want to select and modify elements in x .. .
[12:57:36] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: yepnode, labJS, AMD, Dojo, the list goes on
[12:58:02] <eddiemonge> imanc: $(x).doStuffToMe()
[12:58:15] <imanc> eddiemonge: excellent, thanks =)
[12:58:15] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Oh, I've seen some lists. Moreso looking for recommendations. What's your favorite general purpose script loader?That kind of thing.
[12:58:57] <eddiemonge> warrenparsons: yepnode, labJS, AMD, Dojo
[12:59:26] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Okay, maybe I misunderstood. Those are the ones you like, then?
[12:59:58] <eddiemonge> sure
[13:00:13] <eddiemonge> yepnode - brought to you by some of the people behind jQuery
[13:00:18] <__composern> imanc: are you loaded data by ajax right ?
[13:00:29] <eddiemonge> labJS - brought to you by a guy who loves to tell you he is right (and often is)
[13:00:47] <eddiemonge> AMD - the new format on the block that lets you do all sort of goodness
[13:01:05] <imanc> __composern: it's a mustache template in a var and I need to prepopulate the select lists in it, prior to actually using it
[13:01:13] <eddiemonge> Dojo - the *gasp* evil alternative to building web apps from a jQuery users point of view
[13:01:37] <dame_dudder> hey guys.. please check this link here
[13:01:40] <dame_dudder> http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/
[13:01:49] <dame_dudder> i got it all working except for one thing
[13:01:54] <dame_dudder> i'm using toggle
[13:02:11] <dame_dudder> I want it so if the user click *outside* the grey box that the dropdown disappears
[13:02:11] <devinrolsen> k
[13:02:25] <dame_dudder> right now it only hides within the box
[13:02:33] <dame_dudder> that's it..
[13:02:51] <eddiemonge> dame_dudder: e.target
[13:03:37] <dame_dudder> :) a beginner.. where exactly do I put e.target in the code http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/
[13:03:41] <dame_dudder> eddiemonge
[13:03:57] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Yepnope seems pretty specific to handling polyfills. I was reading on labJS earlier, and it seems more general in purpose. Would you use the two together, or does one obviate the other?
[13:04:44] <devinrolsen> dame_dudder: two options
[13:04:46] <devinrolsen> http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/2/
[13:04:48] <devinrolsen> or http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/1/
[13:04:54] <devinrolsen> pick your poison.
[13:05:00] <dame_dudder> devinrolsen: checking...
[13:05:41] <__composern> $.get("request.php", function(data) { $('#YOUR_DIV).html( data );} ); var ax = $('#YOUR_DIV').find("#YOUR DATA ID");
[13:05:41] <eddiemonge> the /1/ option is bad
[13:05:43] <__composern> now ax variable have all information you need. thank for eddiemonge
[13:05:44] <devinrolsen> sorry dame_dudder, http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/3/
[13:05:51] <devinrolsen> yes eddiemonge.
[13:05:53] <devinrolsen> muh bad.
[13:05:55] <devinrolsen> fixed it.
[13:06:12] <devinrolsen> he can choose the event listen element he wants
[13:06:14] <devinrolsen> I picked body
[13:06:16] <eddiemonge> __composern: you dont need to put it in the DOM to work with it though
[13:06:22] <dame_dudder> devinrolsen: it's almost there
[13:06:24] <dame_dudder> but there's a problem
[13:06:31] <dame_dudder> i don't want to lose any original functions
[13:06:31] <warrenparsons> eddiemonge: Nevermind. I think I answered my own question.
[13:06:40] <devinrolsen> 	sorry dame_dudder, http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/3/
[13:06:43] <dame_dudder> so I still want the dropdown to disappear on .the_click
[13:06:49] <dame_dudder> ok checking..
[13:07:17] <eddiemonge> __composern imanc  var x = "<div>Hi</div>"; x = $(x).append(" Eddie");  x = // <div>Hi Eddie</div>
[13:07:20] <dame_dudder> devinrolsen: it works but it should also trigger in the grey box
[13:07:22] <dame_dudder> so both
[13:07:33] <dame_dudder> right now it only trigger outside the box
[13:07:33] <devinrolsen> it is for me.
[13:07:42] <devinrolsen> if I click the gary box or out side the gray box
[13:07:43] <devinrolsen> its toggles.
[13:07:48] <devinrolsen> ARE YOU CLICKING THE TEXT?
[13:07:50] <devinrolsen> oops
[13:07:52] <dame_dudder> yeah
[13:07:52] <eddiemonge> dame_dudder: then you need to change the target or the checks
[13:07:53] <devinrolsen> sorry for the caps.
[13:07:57] <devinrolsen> dont do that.
[13:08:01] <dame_dudder> devinrolsen: no prob.
[13:08:17] <eddiemonge> dame_dudder: take what people offer you and then build/customize it for your needs
[13:08:24] <devinrolsen> ^
[13:08:32] <eddiemonge> if you want someone to write all the code for you, it better come with a thank you and a check
[13:08:43] <devinrolsen> $
[13:08:45] <imanc> thanks eddie
[13:08:48] <dame_dudder> um well first of all thanks!!
[13:09:10] <dame_dudder> and i did write most of the code.. so it's not like devinrolsen is writing everything
[13:09:13] <devinrolsen> (eddiemonge, I'm going to be that guy that sits behind you and repeats the last word you say today. hehe)
[13:09:21] <dame_dudder> eddiemonge
[13:10:29] <eddiemonge> devinrolsen: was wondering who that would be today
[13:10:52] <dame_dudder> devinrolsen
[13:10:57] <dame_dudder> eddiemonge.. ok almost there
[13:10:58] <dame_dudder> http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/4/
[13:11:09] <dame_dudder> i was able to trigger it on the text as well
[13:11:15] <dame_dudder> but now the problem is
[13:11:29] <dame_dudder> if i click outside the box it shows the dropdown
[13:11:43] <dame_dudder> it should only hide the dropdown if I click outside the box
[13:12:02] <dame_dudder> and only show the dropdown when i click on the text or grey box
[13:12:24] <devinrolsen> dame_dudder http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/5/
[13:12:32] <devinrolsen> going to be rich by the end of the day ;)
[13:13:01] <dame_dudder> bingo!
[13:13:08] <devinrolsen> you can figure the rest if needs more.
[13:13:08] <dame_dudder> thanks devinrolsen!
[13:13:12] <devinrolsen> np
[13:13:30] <bartmax> is there a way for jQuery to detect a string if it's a selector or a url ?
[13:13:51] <devinrolsen> not that I know of.
[13:13:57] <devinrolsen> string is a string, is a string is a string.
[13:15:01] <bartmax> so best would be to add a data-source-id and data-source-url and check which is not empty
[13:15:08] <bartmax> or better data-source and data-mode ?
[13:15:55] <Hawkee> quick question, I'm prepending some html via an $ajax call and would like to pass the html object to another function before I prepend, how do I reference it?
[13:16:06] <bartmax> doing unobstrusive autocomplete, what to set source (remote, or datalist) on dom element.
[13:16:44] <Hawkee> success: function(html) { preprocess(html);  $('#list').prepend(html); }
[13:16:47] <Hawkee> something like this
[13:16:54] <bartmax> yes
[13:17:01] <bartmax> Hawkee: yes
[13:17:25] <Hawkee> in my preprocess function how do I get the encompassing div?
[13:17:35] <bartmax> the what ?
[13:17:36] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, poke
[13:17:37] <Hawkee> is there a general way to reference it?
[13:18:05] <Hawkee> my preprocess function simply takes the input $(input).hover...
[13:18:14] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: this aint facebook
[13:18:23] <lenswipe> lol
[13:18:29] <Hawkee> so I need a div reference rather than straight html to add hover functions
[13:18:40] <someprimetime> warrenparsons: yeah it worked thanks
[13:18:43] <someprimetime> sorry was eating lunch
[13:18:45] <bartmax> $(html).find(selector)
[13:18:51] <warrenparsons> someprimetime: Great
[13:18:55] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, i just wanted your attention  -  i tried that code you jsfiddled to me and i get "Unexpected Token: ILLEGAL" in the chrome console - any ideas?
[13:18:56] <Hawkee> aha
[13:19:19] <bartmax> lenswipe: check for typo and/or bad syntax
[13:19:24] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: i throw around a lot of code
[13:19:27] <eddiemonge> most of it broken
[13:19:32] <eddiemonge> you gots to be more specific-like
[13:19:35] <lenswipe> bartmax, netbeans tends to pick up on syntax erros
[13:19:39] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/2/
[13:19:48] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, it highlights the very last line where the )); is
[13:20:43] <bartmax> url: '<?= site_url('ajax/getjsosn') ?>',
[13:20:46] <bartmax> that's WRONG
[13:20:55] <bartmax> netbeans isn't smarter than me :)
[13:21:50] <lenswipe> bartmax, its not wrong its PHP
[13:22:09] <eddiemonge> dame_dudder: devinrolsen http://jsfiddle.net/FCgGz/6/
[13:22:10] <lenswipe> the PHP is parsed and that gets replaced with the actual URL of my json controller
[13:22:23] <lenswipe> bartmax, next
[13:22:23] <bartmax> lenswipe: post the parsed version on fiddle.
[13:22:27] <mynameis> eddiemonge: checking..
[13:22:28] <lenswipe> okay

[13:23:16] <mosdef100200> anything other than that?
[13:23:21] <mosdef100200> anyone know of?
[13:23:29] <lenswipe> bar__, http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/3/
[13:23:30] <dame_dudder> devinrolsen and eddiemonge: you guys are effin genius
[13:23:32] <lenswipe> bartmax, http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/3/
[13:23:36] <dame_dudder> you read my mind
[13:23:44] <dame_dudder> i was about to ask! and boom
[13:23:51] <dame_dudder> did exactly what i wanted
[13:23:51] <eddiemonge> pssh i know!
[13:23:56] <Hawkee> bartmax, thank you that got me on the right track
[13:23:58] <dame_dudder> wtf!
[13:23:58] <bartmax> lenswipe: html ?
[13:24:09] <eddiemonge> and my example is nice because it doesnt leave event bindings hanging around forever
[13:24:15] <lenswipe> bartmax, just a suffix the framework adds, its not actually HTML
[13:24:21] <eddiemonge> always doing checks when the page is clicked on
[13:24:34] <dame_dudder> worrrd up
[13:24:36] <bartmax> lenswipe: ok, then i can't help.
[13:24:41] <lenswipe> why?
[13:25:05] <lenswipe> bartmax, oh wait were you asking me to post the corresponding HTML to the script?
[13:25:18] <dame_dudder> eddiemonge: there's one thing I noticed.. don't worry it's fine
[13:25:20] <dame_dudder> but I'm curious
[13:25:24] <imanc> close, but no dice.  the template var contains a load of html along with <select class="resolution">, but it ends up containing just the select options returned from makeSelectOpts           template = $('select.resolution', template).append(_this.makeSelectOpts( data.data.initial.resolution ));
[13:25:26] <dame_dudder> you added
[13:25:27] <dame_dudder> e.preventDefault();
[13:25:33] <dame_dudder> but is it really necessary?
[13:25:36] <dame_dudder> because..
[13:25:44] <dame_dudder> i did leave out href
[13:25:45] <dame_dudder> notice
[13:25:49] <dame_dudder> <a>blah</a>
[13:25:53] <dame_dudder> there's no href there
[13:25:59] <lenswipe> bartmax, if so then http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/4/ that is probably what you need
[13:26:02] <dame_dudder> so what's the point of preventdefault in that case?
[13:26:04] <bartmax> dame_dudder: i don't recomend leaving href empty
[13:26:14] <bartmax> dame_dudder: you will see different browser behaviour
[13:26:18] <dame_dudder> bartmax: why not
[13:26:23] <dame_dudder> it validates against html5
[13:26:31] <dame_dudder> it is valid now
[13:26:41] <eddiemonge> dame_dudder: its habit and best practice, at least in my book.
[13:27:09] <dame_dudder> eddiemonge: ok cool
[13:27:30] <eddiemonge> dame_dudder: and an unhref'ed anchor tag might as well be a <button>
[13:27:49] <bartmax> lenswipe: the error on fiddle is because origin is different than fiddle...
[13:27:55] <dame_dudder> eddiemonge: true
[13:27:56] <lenswipe> okay
[13:27:57] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: seems fine to me http://jsfiddle.net/Q7bnj/7/
[13:28:07] <bartmax> lenswipe: what's the return on the ajax call ?
[13:28:09] <eddiemonge> you should press the JSLint button though
[13:28:15] <lenswipe> bartmax, i dont follow

[13:28:38] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: $('title').html should maybe be .text()
[13:28:42] <bartmax> lenswipe: you cannot make a cross domain request with json. you should use jsonp and also allow that on server
[13:28:50] <bartmax> Access-Control-Allow-Origin in the header
[13:28:51] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: thats not a JS error
[13:28:54] <lenswipe> k
[13:29:09] <bartmax> try it on same -domain
[13:29:30] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, if i use .text() it doesnt parse the &mdash;
[13:29:51] <nFFF> You can use CORS in html5 for crossdomain requests

[13:30:35] <bartmax> sarspazam: it shoudl.
[13:30:40] <imanc> eddiemonge: any ideas how I can get this working?    template = $('select.resolution', template).append(_this.makeSelectOpts( data.data.initial.resolution ));    template ends up just containing the options returned from makeSelectOpts
[13:30:59] <nFFF> imanc, whats _this?
[13:31:04] <bartmax> lenswipe: what button should i click ? :D

[13:31:20] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, ...?
[13:31:25] <imanc> nFFF: it's just to retain the context in a block in jquery - i now realise I could have used jquery.proxy, but instead i was doing _this = this;
[13:31:36] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, im deving on my home computer - how rich do you think i am?
[13:31:57] <eddiemonge> i dont see a Update Ajax
[13:32:12] <lenswipe> sorry
[13:32:12] <bartmax> 	the error it's there without doing anything
[13:32:20] <nFFF> imanc, looks like some crazy scheme/lisp macro code ;p
[13:32:20] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, bartmax its "Blogposts" - it used to be "Update AJAX"
[13:32:21] <eddiemonge> imanc: what is template?
[13:32:58] <imanc> template is a load of html template = '<tr id="{{_id}}">' +
[13:32:58] <imanc> '<td><input type="text"  id="{{_id}]_name" class="name" value="" /></td>' +
[13:33:24] <lenswipe> imanc, is that smarty?
[13:33:37] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: look at JSHint.com
[13:33:47] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, ...?
[13:34:14] <imanc> lenswipe: no mustache.  I was using jquery tmpl, but it was causing some issues in IE8.  And with mustache, I need to move the template into the js file because it uses the same tags as django templates
[13:34:22] <lenswipe> k
[13:34:31] <eddiemonge> imanc: you are putting the return from makeSelectOpts into append

[13:36:52] <zowtar> guys to request a xml file from an url, what content type shall I use? contentType 	'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
[13:37:03] <sarspazam> i can't even tell what youve changed/
[13:37:07] <sarspazam> but thanks very much
[13:37:13] <sarspazam> what had I missed?
[13:37:16] <eddiemonge> include jquery
[13:37:18] <eddiemonge> top right
[13:37:28] <bartmax> if it's a well formed xml, should be  accept: 'application/xml'
[13:37:32] <eddiemonge> zowtar: dataType os what you want
[13:37:35] <bartmax> contentType is for the request body, no for the response.
[13:37:36] <eddiemonge> *is
[13:38:06] <bartmax> gtg
[13:38:07] <bartmax> bye
[13:38:23] <zowtar> eddiemonge so, doesn't matter?
[13:38:31] <imanc> eddiemonge: $('select.resolution', template). is selecting the tag correctly, but I guess the problem is the assignment back to template,  so $('select.resolution', template). must be returning just the options.
[13:38:35] <eddiemonge> contentType? not really
[13:38:44] <eddiemonge> unless it does. then it matters a lot
[13:38:56] <lenswipe> bartmax, okay
[13:39:02] <bartmax> lenswipe: worked ?
[13:39:18] <eddiemonge> imanc: if template is a string, then as soon as you wrap it in $() it becomes a jQobject
[13:39:19] <lenswipe> havent tried it yet
[13:39:23] <lenswipe> bartmax, im about to :)
[13:39:35] <zowtar> eddiemonge yes, since i'm requesting, i think it doesn't matter
[13:39:41] <bartmax> lenswipe: ill wait for you to say me that im better than netbeans :D
[13:40:06] <eddiemonge> im better than netbeans
[13:40:16] <eddiemonge> oh wait you said to say that to you
[13:40:19] <eddiemonge> oh well
[13:40:23] <lenswipe> bartmax, nope it didnt work
[13:40:32] <bartmax> lenswipe: im browsing your IP and it works man
[13:40:32] <lenswipe> wait yes it did
[13:40:35] <lenswipe> its finding another error now
[13:40:36] <bartmax> lenswipe: lol
[13:40:58] <lenswipe> it doesnt work btw

[13:41:23] <bartmax> you are getting some bad characters
[13:41:25] <lenswipe> its showing another error now
[13:41:37] <bartmax> it's back
[13:41:45] <bartmax> the error
[13:41:48] <bartmax> there's a problem on your fil
[13:41:50] <bartmax> file i think
[13:41:59] <bartmax> if I change it here and paste it on console works flawlessly
[13:42:12] <bartmax> change the editor or something
[13:42:21] <bartmax> you are getting bad characters on your source file.
[13:42:27] <bartmax> gotta go now... ajax works great here :)
[13:42:28] <lenswipe> :D
[13:42:32] <lenswipe> now it works
[13:42:41] <eddiemonge> does it help if you spell json correctly?
[13:42:43] <bartmax> yup
[13:42:48] <lenswipe> yeah that tends to help
[13:43:47] <eddiemonge> i love the full size picture html-scaled down in the about me section
[13:45:05] <eddiemonge> ?why did you leave us?
[13:48:06] <raj> eddiemonge, are single quotes in json allowed?
[13:48:24] <raj> also, sometimes the key works without any quotes
[13:50:38] <eddiemonge> raj: no.
[13:50:44] <eddiemonge> json is double quoted everything
[13:50:47] <eddiemonge> otherwise it isnt json
[13:50:54] <eddiemonge> http://jsonlint.com/
[14:00:39] <lenswipe> hey guys
[14:00:49] <lenswipe> so i have another question
[14:01:54] <lenswipe> will the jquery event handler change() fire if someone hits a reset button on a form?
[14:05:28] <eddiemonge> ?tias
[14:05:32] <eddiemonge> and then report back
[14:05:37] <eddiemonge> but im feeling like the answer is no
[14:06:33] <lenswipe> hmm
[14:06:45] <lenswipe> well its not firing for me but i wondered if it was just my code
[14:07:16] <nFFF> Why cant you just use a normal click event?
[14:07:18] <lenswipe> do you know of an event handler that would cover someone editing a text feild and hitting the rest button
[14:07:28] <lenswipe> nFFF, i can, but it would be nice to cover both events in one event handler
[14:07:29] <lenswipe> :)
[14:07:42] <nFFF> What do you mean?
[14:09:06] <eddiemonge> reset isnt really a change
[14:09:07] <nFFF> A messy way would be to wrap the text field and reset button within a <div> and bind a click to this div
[14:09:12] <nFFF> and check the target
[14:09:17] <nFFF> if you only wanted one event handler
[14:09:35] <lenswipe> nFFF, http://95.146.94.84/bootstraptest i want to disable the submit button unless both feilds are filled in
[14:09:41] <eddiemonge> imagine having validation checks on a field like required. having a change event on that field be fired when reset is pressed would seriously fuck things up
[14:09:54] <_dave_h_d> hi all, my on click have stopped working on safari after i applied a bunch of css using jquery on bunch of elements, this is safari only, anyone had this before?
[14:10:03] <nFFF> lenswipe use a class
[14:10:08] <lenswipe> nFFF, ??
[14:10:19] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: why even have the cancel button?
[14:10:36] <lenswipe> to clear the form
[14:10:41] <lenswipe> although i guess its not strictly neccecary
[14:10:46] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: exactly
[14:11:15] <nFFF> .fieldsempty {display:none;} $('.fields').change(function(){$('#button').removeClass('fieldsempty'); });
[14:11:31] <nFFF> thats the basic
[14:11:55] <nFFF> Id probably check $(this).val().length!=0
[14:12:07] <nFFF> just incase they delete
[14:14:02] <poppiez> I've binded the 'submit' event to a form with a hidden input submit button. 'submit' fires in firefox when I submit on enter, but not in safari. why is that?
[14:14:42] <eddiemonge> nFFF: but does reset fire change? if not then that function is useless
[14:15:13] <eddiemonge> poppiez: say what? hidden input submit button?
[14:15:16] <nFFF> no it doesn't, all that function will do is hide/show the submit button
[14:15:17] <xrated> Is there any reason that .append would silently fail?
[14:15:59] <poppiez> eddiemonge: yeah, I'm just testing some stuff out. just wondering why safari doesn't fire the submit event
[14:16:16] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, nFFF got some weird behaviour here - the change() event is only fired when the user defocuses the field - is this normal??
[14:19:26] <eddiemonge> xrated: not really
[14:20:00] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: thats what it does. change fires on the blur event, when its been changed
[14:20:50] <lenswipe> ah
[14:22:39] <adz> how do I merge the contents of 2 jquery selectors (ex: [ $('input[type="text"][id*="cimy"]'), 				$('input[id="user_login"]'), 				$('input[id="pwd"]')		 			];
[14:23:13] <eddiemonge> ?Add @ adz
[14:23:14] <bot-t> adz, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[14:23:47] <adz> awesome! Thanks eddiemonge
[14:24:07] <eddiemonge> maybe merge as well but never used it
[14:35:42] <zanberdo> I'd like to push a file from the server to the browser. The file in question is a certificate. Simply using window.location=path_to_file as a response to a click event does work, except the browser recognizes the file type and in FF it throws an error that it's not a valid cert. I don't want the browser to examine the file, just to prompt the user to save the file. Is there a way to do this via jquery?
[14:36:14] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: window.open
[14:36:34] <eddiemonge> zanberdo: and then your server needs to send the proper heads to prompt for download
[14:39:33] <zanberdo> eddiemonge, let me see what I can do with that. Quick question, where might I find the proper heads to prompt for download?
[14:40:18] <zanberdo> nm, think I have a lead
[14:43:17] <reisi> is there any way to debug what event listeners i've got attached using jquery?
[14:47:11] <eddiemonge> debug? or view?
[14:47:14] <eddiemonge> data("events")
[14:47:44] <reisi> eddiemonge: at this stage learning to view would be huge debugging step :)
[14:47:47] <reisi> eddiemonge: thanks
[14:50:03] <sahbeewah> how does data("events") work?
[14:50:37] <eddiemonge> ?tias
[14:50:38] <bot-t> Try It And See
[14:55:07] <sahbeewah> ok thanks
[14:57:58] <reisi> can i from javascript fire an form event that'd be equal to pressing TAB without selecting the next focused input myself?
[14:58:20] <eddiemonge> ?blur @ reisi
[14:58:21] <bot-t> reisi, .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[14:59:31] <reisi> eddiemonge: that's the event fired when a element loses focus right? i'd like to force the focus change that pressing TAB makes; not interested in the blur
[15:00:36] <Eviltwin> So call .focus() on the element you want to have focus instead
[15:01:22] <eddiemonge> you said "without selecting the next focused input" which to me says blur the current focus but dont do anything else
[15:02:04] <reisi> eddiemonge: are you implying that blurring the currently focused component would change the focus over to the next?
[15:02:06] <Eviltwin> eddiemonge: People always lie about what they want
[15:02:10] <reisi> :)
[15:02:12] <patriot11> how to add your website or webapp via safari to your home screen in iphone automaticlly?
[15:02:28] <patriot11> using jquery
[15:02:37] <Eviltwin> patriot11: Automatically?
[15:02:40] <Eviltwin> I don't think you can
[15:02:56] <eddiemonge> patriot11: you cant. thats called spam. and no one likes spam
[15:02:57] <Eviltwin> And even if you can, there's definitely not support for it in jQuery without some plugin written specificly for it
[15:03:36] <eddiemonge> reisi: argh you are confusing me. what do you want to do in small, baby words so Eviltwin will understand?
[15:03:50] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[15:03:50] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[15:03:53] <Eviltwin> :D
[15:03:57] <patriot11> eviltwin:did u know any safari plugin that do that
[15:04:00] <patriot11> ?
[15:04:08] <reisi> eddiemonge: oki, i'll try
[15:04:08] <Eviltwin> patriot11: No, and I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually exist
[15:04:43] <eddiemonge> patriot11: stop trying to spam peeps. they wont like it and will hack your site to stop it
[15:06:10] <patriot11> any way thank you eviltwin for your help
[15:32:50] <achen> I have a form with an id "bar".  I'd like to disable all of the input elements under there.  I can select the form with $("#bar"), but I can't figure out how to select all the input's under there.
[15:33:05] <achen> I've tried doing $("#bar :input") as a selector, but that's not getting anything back.
[15:33:40] <achen> I also tried doing a $("#bar").find($(":input")), but got an empty array back for that.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong here?
[15:35:15] <dabear> achen: $("#bar :input") or $("#bar").find(":input")
[15:35:36] <dabear> so your first option should and will work
[15:35:45] <dabear> unless you screwed up somehow
[15:36:00] <achen> let me come up with a quick test case.  thanks.
[15:36:05] <dabear> usually that means you are running the selector before all inputs are loaded etc
[15:38:48] <achen> hm, i see that it's doing the right thing on an isolated test case
[15:39:12] <achen> from firebug, i can do $("#bar") and get a form reference, but $("#bar :input") gives me an empty array
[15:40:10] <dabear> achen: ok, so fix it
[15:40:25] <dabear> or provide us with any sort of demo
[15:41:24] <achen> ah ok, i think i see the problem.  i'm writing invalid html.  i have a <form> with a bunch of <tr>'s in it, which i guess firefox is interpreting as an empty form when i browse the computed html
[15:44:25] <achen> thanks.  this is almost certainly my fault for bad html.
[15:44:37] <dabear> ;)
[15:59:15] <tazrover> trying to use $.post() to send JSON to my server, but my ruby controller doesn't seem to be "seeing" my JSON.  it creates a new object but all data fields are null.  would really appreciate any help.
[16:02:36] <imanc> hey, can someone have a look at this?
[16:02:39] <imanc> http://pastie.org/3508004
[16:02:55] <imanc> I have a var template = $('lots of html');
[16:03:37] <imanc> there's a set of <select> objects in the template var, which I need to occupy with select options
[16:03:53] <nFFF> thats some crazy code right thurre
[16:04:47] <imanc> nFFF: agreed - any advice on how to make it less crazy would be appreciated
[16:05:18] <nFFF> what is that html?
[16:05:40] <imanc> the template code was in the page, but the mustache template tags conflict with django's tags … so I had to it out of the django template
[16:06:06] <nFFF> yea way too late and tired to help, sorry
[16:06:08] <imanc> it's basically a table I'm building up - and ti's a single row of the table
[16:15:32] <LittleFoot> is it ok to use a cross domain js widget make an api call to my api instead of having the customer do a curl call to my api
[16:17:36] <Kaseano> hi, I have a site with a decent amount of jq animation on it, and it seems to drag down on low cpu computers or legacy browsers.  So my solution was going to be to check the user agent for an up to date browser
[16:17:49] <Kaseano> is there any way to tell if a client has the processing power for the anim tho?
[16:18:11] <Kaseano> drag down = become choppy
[16:20:01] <peol> Kaseano: Not per sé, you could check for features that would indicate the performance (i.e. native JSON support for example), but it still wouldn't be detected by the actual feature you want to "detect".
[16:20:56] <Kaseano> thanks peol, do you think checking for native JSON support would be a safe alternative?
[16:22:00] <peol> Kaseano: Not really, it would be an assumption. But it's still subjective and since there's no "performance"-detected feature to be tested, you can never be sure. Ideally, that's what you'd want.
[16:24:19] <someprimetime> does delegate have a callback function?
[16:24:24] <someprimetime> that I can return a variable with
[16:26:54] <dabear> someprimetime: return a variable? the delegated callback will be called some date in the future
[16:27:32] <Transcended> Hi, I have a general question.  I have a link that loads dynamic content into a div... there are a ton of actions within that newly loaded dynamic content.  Do I have to create a new delegate function for each of those actions in my success handler?  How can I consolidate these functions?
[16:27:41] <someprimetime> dabear, well i delegated a click which is a closure, naturally…. so i'd like to be able to pass the variable that i set within that closure to the parent function
[16:28:31] <dabear> someprimetime: nope, the parent function will have ended its execution when the delegated is run
[16:28:51] <someprimetime> var parent = function(removed) {   $('#foobar').delegate('.btn', 'click', function(removed) { removed = true; }); };
[16:28:57] <someprimetime> basically i want to pass removed back to the parent
[16:29:00] <someprimetime> ah damn
[16:32:15] <dabear> jquery does have the concept of deferreds though, which you can return from the parent, and then resolve from the delegate
[16:32:33] <teratorn> hi, how do I know if/when a jquery.post() call fails?
[16:32:52] <dabear> it might be overkill for your project though, someprimetime. but if you wanna read about it, here it is: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/
[16:33:19] <someprimetime> dabear: interesting. this isn't overkill for my project at all
[16:33:24] <joikus> how can i replace <body onload="setupblocks()">
[16:33:26] <someprimetime> it's a big project that i'm just close to finishing up
[16:33:27] <joikus> using jquery
[16:33:31] <joikus> and remove it from the body tag?
[16:33:34] <someprimetime> thanks
[16:35:59] <zteffen> I want to delay this event "if { self.startAutoScrolling();   } " Cant seem to figure out how to do it.. I guess I should put " .delay(9000) " in there in some way?
[16:41:26] <zteffen> I've also tried 				setTimeout(startAutoScrolling,9000); without any luck
[16:44:12] <LittleFoot> zteffen
[16:44:27] <LittleFoot> its setTimeout("startAutoScrolling()",9000);
[16:44:45] <LittleFoot> or setTimeout(function() { startAutoScrolling },9000);
[16:44:54] <LittleFoot> sory
[16:44:58] <LittleFoot> setTimeout(function() { startAutoScrolling(); },9000);
[16:46:06] <ngharo> his original example is valid: setTimeout(startAutoScrolling,9000);
[16:46:15] <ngharo> assuming startAutoScrolling is a function
[16:46:15] <DyeA> I cant remember - say I am looping through a jquery set and perfoming multiple operations on $(this), should I be caching $(this) at the top of the loop?
[16:46:29] <LittleFoot> does it acept it like that?
[16:46:38] <ngharo> yes
[16:46:42] <LittleFoot> does it treat it like funciton automaticly
[16:46:52] <LittleFoot> even w out quotes
[16:46:58] <ngharo> yes
[16:46:59] <zteffen> I'm testing it out now. Thanks!
[16:47:00] <LittleFoot> or ()
[16:47:04] <ngharo> yes
[16:47:08] <ngharo> hehe
[16:47:10] <LittleFoot> nice
[16:47:12] <LittleFoot> lol
[16:47:23] <ngharo> DyeA: yes you should
[16:47:30] <zteffen> the original line reads self.startAutoScrolling(); by the way.
[16:47:51] <DyeA> ngharo: yes? its not obvious to me
[16:48:04] <dabear> wait, so you expect settimeout to not treat a function like a function
[16:48:07] <dabear> waaa
[16:49:00] <DyeA> ngharo: I tried googling it but didn't come back with much but I swear I have seen that on performance posts somewhere
[16:49:36] <ngharo> DyeA: what's your question?
[16:50:07] <zteffen> setTimeout(function() { self.startAutoScrolling(); },9000); Not giving me any love
[16:50:28] <DyeA> nothing, I was hoping you would break it down for me but I just found this as well
[16:50:29] <DyeA> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6587687/should-i-cache-this-in-jquery-if-it-is-used-more-than-once
[16:50:39] <DyeA> ngharo: thanks for your help!
[16:51:09] <dabear> zteffen: the reference to self will be lost inside a settimeout call
[16:51:33] <dabear> hm, or maybe just for this
[16:51:56] <zteffen> i'm a bit lost inside a settimeout call
[16:52:20] <DyeA> ngharo:did you look at that link? I have a further question if you did
[16:52:37] <ngharo> shoot
[16:52:40] <LittleFoot> first check w out timeout
[16:53:39] <DyeA> ngharo: regarding the askers code, is there a difference between $selected or caching to "selected = ..." and then accessing it like $(selected)
[16:54:06] <DyeA> seems like using $() is an automatic perf hit?
[16:54:14] <DyeA> parsing
[16:54:30] <ngharo> pretty much
[16:54:40] <zteffen> LittleFoot: What do you mean?
[16:54:48] <ngharo> i also var $this = $(this); if im going to be using it a lot
[16:55:30] <DyeA> ngharo: ok, i usually cache my stuff to a x style variable instead of $x and then use x like $(x) so it seems like I'm doing it wrong!
[16:55:42] <ngharo> yes indeedy
[16:55:44] <DyeA> argh
[16:55:54] <LittleFoot> zteffen: try comenting the timeout function to see if the scroling one works
[16:56:08] <DyeA> ok thankyou, I need to review some perfomance documents/guides sounds like
[16:56:08] <dabear> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#each2
[16:56:20] <dabear> if you wanna access $(this) faster
[16:56:56] <DyeA> ahh ok I'll check it out
[16:58:04] <DyeA> weird, his use case seems pretty standard, not sure why the core wouldn't have been optimized for that type of use
[16:58:26] <DyeA> from the articel: "When you need to do $(this) inside an .each loop iterating over many thousands of elements, you could use this plugin instead of .each, because it has been specifically optimized for this use case."
[16:59:10] <zteffen> it always scrolls. but im getting no delay
[16:59:24] <ngharo> ?p @ zteffen
[16:59:25] <bot-t> zteffen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:00:39] <LittleFoot> ok so the scroller works
[17:00:44] <LittleFoot> so self. doesnt
[17:00:51] <LittleFoot> what is self
[17:01:04] <ngharo> i've been contemplating that all my life
[17:01:26] <LittleFoot> since u have that call inside a function its not finding it
[17:02:08] <LittleFoot> so u should make sure its available
[17:02:23] <LittleFoot> or pass self into the function as arg
[17:03:13] <LittleFoot> setTimeout(function(self) { self.startAutoScrolling(); },9000);
[17:04:00] <zteffen> http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/
[17:04:15] <zteffen> in effect: http://steffeno.net/2test.php
[17:04:43] <zteffen> I'm trying to force it to halt the autostart so the page has time to load before it sets off
[17:05:18] <ngharo> why not attach to the load event then?
[17:05:21] <ngharo> ?load @ zteffen
[17:05:22] <bot-t> zteffen, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[17:05:26] <zteffen> based on  Thomas Kahns jQuery SmoothDivScroll 1.2 BETA
[17:05:38] <LittleFoot> ok then u need to also use $(documet).ready()
[17:06:02] <ngharo> no, ready fires before all resources (like images) are downloaded
[17:06:05] <zteffen> yea but it is quite image heavy andif the last images havent loaded it should still start
[17:06:18] <ngharo> oh
[17:11:25] <defendguin> anyone here using the google maps api to display a map on your page?
[17:11:39] <defendguin> nm wrong window
[17:16:28] <ngharo> zteffen: you could do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/12246/
[17:16:52] <ngharo> attach a class preload to x images, and when they're loaded fire your scroller off
[17:20:04] <zteffen> not sure I understand you right, but letme give it a shot!
[17:24:00] <zteffen> Well, now I can't even figure out how to clear the cache on FF but it does seem like it is starting before all .spread are loaded
[17:24:51] <sahbeewah> hi, looking for a second js framework to learn, does anyone have any recommendations
[17:25:22] <LittleFoot> is it working
[17:25:26] <zteffen> But anyway I fear that it will slow it down so much. A 1-2 second delay on that self.startAutoScrolling(); event would be good i think
[17:32:39] <zteffen> No, I can't get it to work. http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/
[17:33:03] <LittleFoot> works for me
[17:34:15] <zteffen> really, it loads that 5meg picture bedore starting to scroll?
[17:34:38] <LittleFoot> oh
[17:34:42] <ngharo> zteffen: are you hitting UPDATE on jsfiddle?  because that appears to have nothing to do with an image
[17:34:42] <LittleFoot> i am not checking ur site
[17:35:04] <LittleFoot> only way to check if the 5 meg image is loaded is to use ajax on it
[17:35:21] <LittleFoot> load the image via ajax
[17:35:24] <raj> if I'm getting a json object return, how can I pass that object to a script in a different <script> tag?
[17:35:28] <LittleFoot> then on success display the image
[17:35:33] <LittleFoot> and start ur scroller
[17:35:36] <LittleFoot> done!
[17:35:55] <raj> i'm getting the json object via an ajax callback
[17:36:10] <LittleFoot> create the script tag
[17:36:13] <LittleFoot> on success
[17:36:29] <LittleFoot> or find the scripttag and append it
[17:36:40] <raj> append what?
[17:36:45] <LittleFoot> the json
[17:36:47] <raj> i wanna append data for the other script tag to use
[17:37:07] <raj> I want the other scriptag basically waiting for data
[17:37:15] <raj> when the first script has a json object returned
[17:37:17] <zteffen> yea I'll give that a shot. just load the first few by ajax. is there a good way of forcing some things load in like a priority mode?
[17:37:40] <LittleFoot> just put them high up
[17:37:42] <LittleFoot> on the list
[17:37:55] <LittleFoot> just in the code u kno
[17:38:07] <zteffen> yea i guess it loads as its read
[17:39:03] <zteffen> my head aches too much to keep at it, but thanks for good suggestions and help. ill be at it again tomorrow. By this weekend it will be perfect :)
[17:39:46] <LittleFoot> u can also make a recursive timeout
[17:40:13] <LittleFoot> that keeps checking over and for something
[17:40:32] <zteffen> yea i should have a fail safe so it starts even if there is a glitc in loading
[17:41:40] <zteffen> coding really has me at a love/hate relationship. so much cool you can do, and so uncool when it doesnt do what you think it should
[17:45:07] <dilvie> zteffen: The problem with coding is that there are so many ways to make mistakes. ;)
[17:45:30] <zteffen> tell me about it ;
[17:45:48] <LittleFoot> why the hell are my numbers getting converted from floats to string
[17:45:57] <LittleFoot> doing num1+num3
[17:46:04] <LittleFoot> im geting num1num3
[17:46:16] <danheberden> LittleFoot are they for sure number? make them numbers to be safe
[17:46:30] <LittleFoot> they are floats
[17:46:38] <danheberden> ?eval +"1" + 1
[17:46:40] <bot-t> danheberden: 2
[17:46:53] <LittleFoot> only func i know is parseint
[17:47:02] <danheberden> LittleFoot if you're getting concatenation, i think you have strings :p
[17:47:05] <LittleFoot> this isnt c++ exactly lol
[17:47:17] <danheberden> you can use the unary operator to make a string a number
[17:47:23] <LittleFoot> well im doing some math on it and that part is working
[17:47:30] <LittleFoot> how
[17:47:41] <LittleFoot> price = (Math.ceil(qs.dynamic_price / 100) * 100) / 100 + 1 - 0.01;
[17:47:45] <LittleFoot> that part works
[17:47:56] <LittleFoot> var total = (price) + (qs.dynamic_price);
[17:47:58] <LittleFoot> doesnt
[17:48:25] <LittleFoot> i cant understand y after 10 yrs of jsing i havent hit this issue lol
[17:48:42] <danheberden> var total = +qs.dynamic_price + price
[17:48:54] <danheberden> where the + unary operator makes sure it's a number
[17:49:09] <LittleFoot> cool thx
[17:49:12] <danheberden> the other option would be (1*qs.dynamic_price) + price
[17:49:25] <danheberden> or parseFloat(x) blah blah blah
[17:49:45] <LittleFoot> oh so there is a parse float
[19:04:09] <Wulf> Hello
[19:04:22] <jrockjiggz> sup
[19:04:30] <Wulf> can I ask about "jQuery SVG" here?
[19:04:45] <jrockjiggz> sure
[19:07:13] <Wulf> ok. I have an svg (with playing cards, http://svg-cards.sourceforge.net/) and I want to display only one card on a webpage. I think that I can solve this by first loading the whole svg into an invible canvas (that works), then selecting one card with svg.getElementById('king_space') (works also) and then adding it to another svg canvas. No errors, the card just doesn't show
[19:08:59] <danheberden> Wulf and using dev-tools/firebug can you find that svg element in your dom?
[19:09:08] <danheberden> find out what its display settings are?
[19:10:30] <Wulf> danheberden: with the dev-tools (?) it looks like the card is added
[19:10:44] <danheberden> and it has a height/width greater than 0/
[19:10:45] <danheberden> ?
[19:11:25] <Wulf> the div in which I put it, yes.
[19:11:38] <Wulf> but that could be a problem..
[19:12:02] <Wulf> yes, that's the problem.
[19:12:11] <danheberden> are you just appending that? or are you creating an svg element and adding it to that
[19:12:12] <Wulf> if I make the div much bigger, it shows somewhere in the middle
[19:12:16] <danheberden> oh gotcha
[19:32:35] <Teza19> Hi, I am trying to change a style using a javascript 'onClick' function on a button. I cannot seem to get the change to work. It is for a CSS3 animation to 'start' or 'pause'

[19:47:54] <jamesw> how can i get the element closest to the mouse, preferably with jquery?
[19:48:12] <jamesw> (.closest() looks for the closest structurally i think, not visually)
[19:48:35] <jrockjiggz> patrickvw: should create an array

[19:58:23] <patrickvw> @bot-t posted some code on jsfiddle but it doesnt work like that in my browser
[20:02:52] <nsanden> hey guys, looking at http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists - when you drag an item from list 1 to list 2, the item keeps its original look. any pointers on how i can make it look like the items in list 2?
[20:12:30] <patrickvw> I have some divs wordpress style and I want the state of the div stored in a cookie how do i do that?
[20:12:32] <patrickvw> http://jsfiddle.net/patrickvw/qRmNk/9/
[20:18:25] <nsanden> patrick: look at the sortable methods, theres toArray  serialize, et
[20:19:13] <patrickvw> I can get sortable to work only I can not get the slideToggle to work
[20:20:17] <patrickvw> I want to store the slide state in a cookie or something but I don't know how
[20:22:51] <nsanden> seems like you could just check if its a hidden or not?
[20:24:43] <imsky> i see you baby
[20:24:44] <patrickvw> nsanden:  how can i retrieve the open/close state for all divs in an array

[20:48:25] <defendguin> jqm sucks :-(
[20:49:48] <lenswipe> hey guys
[20:49:54] <defendguin> randomly events wont fire when they are supposed to
[20:50:00] <lenswipe> http://95.146.94.84/bootstraptest
[20:50:08] <lenswipe> does anyone know why the date picker on that page has no background?
[20:57:36] <gf3> LIES
[20:57:38] <gf3> ALL LIES

[20:58:44] <imsky> ALL TRUTHS
[20:58:52] <lenswipe> does anyone know why the date picker on that page has no background?
[20:58:53] <lenswipe> http://95.146.94.84/bootstraptest
[20:58:59] <imsky> hey lenswipe
[20:59:04] <lenswipe> hi  imsky
[20:59:14] <imsky> your page is hidden behind a login
[20:59:19] <lenswipe> huh?
[20:59:32] <lenswipe> imsky, just type anything in there it doesnt validate logins
[21:00:04] <imsky> you brave soul
[21:00:16] <imsky> lol jquery ui
[21:00:30] <lenswipe> hmm?
[21:00:32] <imsky> i think there are known jqui/bootstrap issues
[21:00:37] <imsky> but anyway, you didn't include the jqui css
[21:00:41] <imsky> so...yeah
[21:00:47] <imsky> TOUGH PROBLEM YOU GOT THERE
[21:00:47] <lenswipe> where do i get it?
[21:00:51] <imsky> lol
[21:01:02] <lenswipe> btw theres no backend to this app hence the lack of login
[21:01:09] <imsky> sure sure
[21:01:16] <lenswipe> so if someone does get in(as you have) they cant do anything destructive
[21:01:46] <imsky> A+
[21:01:47] <lenswipe> i mean sure you could DDOS the server which wouldnt be hard cos its just my home ADSL connection, but you could do that without the login
[21:02:07] <lenswipe> and tbh if you did it might motivate me to finally get to bed XD
[21:02:25] <imsky> what the hell are you talking about
[21:02:29] <lenswipe> ?
[21:02:32] <lenswipe> its 5am here
[21:02:33] <imsky> did you forget why you're here
[21:02:36] <lenswipe> nope
[21:02:39] <imsky> you're here because of a css issue
[21:02:48] <imsky> ok well...stop getting off your own topic
[21:02:48] <lenswipe> but my mind does wander late at night
[21:02:51] <tylerwillingham> Can anyone peak at this and let me know why you think the function would fire on load rather than on the click event: https://gist.github.com/ebc9bffda084fe9912f1
[21:02:53] <imsky> then go to bed
[21:03:00] <lenswipe> imsky, no :p
[21:03:12] <imsky> lenswipe: ok
[21:03:24] <lenswipe> :p
[21:03:41] <imsky> tylerwillingham: because you're not passing an anonymous function to the live handler, you're evaluating watchVideo
[21:04:44] <tylerwillingham> I'm sorry - maybe it's the drinks making me not understand, but syntactically what would i need to do to correct that
[21:04:52] <imsky> lol you code while drunk?
[21:04:56] <imsky> you brave soul you
[21:05:02] <tylerwillingham> not ordinarily :)
[21:05:07] <imsky> i get tempted, but i know i can't code for shit while hammered
[21:05:22] <tylerwillingham> but its 11pm and I'm usually done working at 5
[21:05:22] <imsky> anyway, you should just wrap that bad boy in a function(){}
[21:05:33] <imsky> function(){yourBullshitHere()}
[21:06:28] <tylerwillingham> you're a fine gentleman. also i like your function name
[21:06:47] <gf3> is he?
[21:06:50] <gf3> and do you?
[21:06:54] <imsky> blame it on the alc-a-alcohol
[21:07:15] * gf3 takes another sip of wine
[21:07:21] <tylerwillingham> i think your lyrics are off ;)
[21:07:48] <imsky> tyler
[21:08:04] <imsky> do you by any chance have a beard, a mustache, a wool cap, or thick frame glasses?
[21:08:39] <tylerwillingham> I'm 20, i have as much facial hair as my genes will let me grow (not a lot) - but if you're asking if i'm a hipster - no

[21:14:01] <imsky> do what now
[21:14:25] <tylerwillingham> imsky: "imsky: do you by any chance have a beard, a mustache, a wool cap, or thick frame glasses?"
[21:14:48] <raj> anyone with jstree experience, I'd love to ask a couple questions of you!
[21:16:10] <imsky> tylerwillingham: no worries brah, you passed the test
[21:16:40] <imsky> this however

[21:16:45] <imsky> is lulzworthy
[21:17:29] <tylerwillingham> yeah… i have some tacky shit like that all over the internet that i haven't rewritten.

[21:18:27] <imsky> no sweat buddy, that thing's 4 years old
[21:18:53] <imsky> but then, if you have a d-80 and a bunch of lenses, where are the photos?
[21:19:45] <tylerwillingham> i mostly stopped shooting. and i have a d7000 as a paperweight. sold the whole kit on that page to help fund my current money pit.

[21:20:53] <imsky> cool story bro
[21:22:01] <nsanden> guys, how come my $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel');  isnt canceling?  http://jsfiddle.net/3EYFh/27/
[21:47:53] <QF-MichaelK> What's the recommended way of adding a listener to a field that is later added through $.post?
[21:58:46] <onyx> is it possible to pass a var to Jquery and have it work on that instead of the document elements?
[22:00:18] <gf3> ?tias @ onyx
[22:00:19] <bot-t> onyx, Try It And See
[22:00:44] <onyx> not even sure where to start with syntax...
[22:00:54] <gf3> did you check the docs?
[22:01:23] <gf3> http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery
[22:01:26] <QF-MichaelK> rtfm -> tldr
[22:01:44] <gf3> QF-MichaelK: rtfm → tldr → lmgtfy
[22:03:01] <onyx> thanks! will scour that
[22:04:08] <QF-MichaelK> gf3: so true!
[22:04:48] <biffy_> I am fairly new to jquery but not JS. Lets say I have this code: $('a').each(function(index, url) { ... } is there anywhere on the web which lists the different params to the each method?
[22:05:29] <gf3> biffy_: like the documentation?
[22:06:20] <biffy_> well yes but what i meant was sometimes i can do .each(function(index) and sometimes i can specify a second, (possibly third?) i just wondered
[22:06:50] <gf3> biffy_: jqapi.com is nice
[22:07:27] <biffy_> also the properties of url in my original query, such as url.href gets the href, url.text gets the link text, etc
[22:07:31] <biffy_> okay thanks i will look
[22:08:32] <gf3> also
[22:08:48] <gf3> Stargate SG1, S01E01 shows full bush...
[22:08:50] <gf3> so.....
[22:12:46] <nachito> Can I get some help with this http://pastebin.com/ntMZx3gX
[22:13:16] <bios> anyone familiar w/ jquery mobile?
[22:13:20] <bios> and around :]
[22:13:33] <QF-MichaelK> nachito: what's the problem?
[22:13:45] <bios> yo * .. I'm newb to jquery and mobile.. I've got an app populating a list from json.. I am wondering how I can tell which list item has been clicked, so I know what to load next?
[22:13:50] <bios> sorry..
[22:13:53] <nachito> QF-MichaelK: I'm using set interval, but I want to execute that function just once
[22:14:01] <bios> thought it would be easier to re-post than re-type
[22:14:01] <nachito> QF-MichaelK: check the comment
[22:14:03] <bios> but that's the issue
[22:14:21] <QF-MichaelK> nachito: open(); //instead of setInterval
[22:14:40] <QF-MichaelK> nachito: or call it through an anonymous function.
[22:15:26] <bios> I did post in the jquerymobile channel, but it's pretty idle
[22:15:28] <nachito> QF-MichaelK: I need to use set interval, otherwise it's impossible, I'm doing the call during an animation
[22:15:40] <nachito> QF-MichaelK: not sure what you mean by an anonymous function
[22:15:58] <QF-MichaelK> an anonymous function is called when it is declared
[22:17:20] <QF-MichaelK> nachito: seems like you should just setInterval of a function and call open() with the params you want
[22:18:19] <nachito> QF-MichaelK: I've no idea
[22:18:27] <nachito> QF-MichaelK: been trying for like 3 hours
[22:18:45] <QF-MichaelK> XP cest la vie
[22:18:47] <spiffie> try var open = function() {...}
[22:19:34] <nachito> spiffie: what would be the difference
[22:20:14] <spiffie> blah blah technical mumbo jumbo. what's the harm in trying? :)
[22:20:28] <nachito> spiffie: I did, not working
[22:20:47] <bios> no jquery mobile people in here then?
[22:22:44] <spiffie> hm, you might need to be more specific about what it's doing then. or set up a jsfiddle.
[22:26:49] <ngharo> bios: wrap your li contents in an <a>
[22:27:59] <bios> really?
[22:28:08] <ngharo> yeah really
[22:28:16] <ngharo> inspect the API docs, you'll see they do that
[22:28:25] <bios> ok.. thx ngharo!! :]
[22:28:39] <bios> I've seriously been digging for an answer for about an hour
[22:28:39] <bios> heh
[22:31:16] <bios> ngharo: then one more question.. I guess, I'm loading my page.. but I am dynamically loading the content of that page depending on what list item was clicked.. so, I need to pull the title attribute from the clicked element.. any idea how to get that?
[22:35:12] <ngharo> you .loadPage('foo.php?title=bar'), then you can either generate the content server side, or parse the URL client side via $.mobile.path.parseUrl() and grab the query string
[22:36:10] <bios> how can I get attributes of the element I clicked on? That will solve my issue
[22:36:27] <Transcended> Hmm, I'm using delegate functions to make sure I can use actions after dynamically loading in content with ajax.  However, it seems as though I'm unable to edit the html of a div via it's ID... but if I use a class it works fine.  Any ideas?
[22:36:33] <ngharo> ?attr @ bios
[22:36:34] <bot-t> bios, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[22:37:13] <ngharo> Transcended: are you reusing the same ID in more than one place?
[22:37:21] <Transcended> ngharo: no
[22:37:29] <Transcended> ngharo: they are unique
[22:38:28] <ngharo> delegate isnt typically used with IDs, can you paste some code
[22:38:29] <ngharo> ?p
[22:38:30] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:40:24] <Transcended> ngharo: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/560150/
[22:40:32] <drixie> what are the alternatives for browsers that do not support localstorage?
[22:40:50] <Transcended> ngharo: there's an error in that code that I just introduced (in the success handler)
[22:41:10] <Transcended> ngharo: it's only the .html line that should be working but isn't
[22:43:51] <ngharo> have you console.log($('#task_comments_' + task_id)) to make sure it's grabbing the right thing?
[22:45:25] <Transcended> ngharo: i'll try it
[22:46:20] <Transcended> ngharo: yes, it's pulling it, and when I hover over the log in firebug it highlights where the html should be replaced
[22:47:06] <ngharo> is it a div?
[22:48:13] <Transcended> ngharo: yes
[22:48:28] <Transcended> ngharo: getting [div#task_comments_55.task_comments] back in the console log
[22:48:59] <Transcended> but for some reason $('#task_comments_' + task_id).html("sdlasdfasdf"); does nothing
[22:49:14] <ngharo> and you're not getting any errors thrown in console?
[22:49:17] <Transcended> nope, none
[22:50:27] <ngharo> could it be styles or something preventing you from seeing the change?
[22:50:30] <ngharo> idk maign
[22:50:43] <Transcended> ngharo: yet, if I do $('.task_comments').html("sdfsdf"); right beneath it, it updates all the task_comments divs with the html
[22:52:03] <ngharo> does that append call work as expected?
[22:52:09] <ngharo> in your success func
[22:53:52] <ngharo> maybe try $('.task_comments', this).html( ... )
[22:54:21] <Transcended> ngharo: what would $('.task_comments', this) select?
[22:54:33] <Transcended> and no, the append doesn't work either
[22:54:36] <ngharo> .task_comments inside of this
[22:55:02] <Transcended> .task_comments isn't inside of this
[22:56:03] <ngharo> oh i see
[22:56:39] <ngharo> if console.log() worked on that selector, there's no reason why html() shouldnt
[22:56:40] <ngharo> hmmm!
[22:56:49] <ngharo> you got a demo?
[22:58:51] <Transcended> ngharo: it works if I just do $(clicked_item).parent().parent().next().html('bleh');
[22:59:08] <Transcended> not the prettiest, but it works
[22:59:58] <Transcended> i'm still wondering why I can't access elements dynamically by id
[23:00:10] <ngharo> $(this).closest($parent).find('.task_comments').html('blah') might be a bit cleaner
[23:00:13] <ngharo> yeah me too
[23:00:15] <ngharo> demo it up
[23:02:03] <Transcended> I wonder if it's something buggy with delegate that maybe on would take care of
[23:02:28] <Transcended> if you want to give me your public ip address i can show you what i'm working on
[23:03:32] <ngharo> i just want to see the problem
[23:04:14] <Transcended> i would have to give you access to the web server
[23:04:22] <Transcended> k one sec
[23:47:33] <mehrdad> how do i add custom properties to an event? the docs are not clear and event.originalEvent is undefined for me
[23:53:44] <donCams> Eviltwin: ping!
[23:55:11] <jrockjiggz> mehrdad: can' you just document.body.custom = { name: 'John' };
[23:56:20] <lmao25> I have a form, when somebody submits invalid data it then adds a class which adds a red border. How can i make the border pulsate?
[23:57:08] <dualcore> lmao25: check out .animate()
[23:57:17] <dualcore> you'll have to write a function with a loop
[23:57:46] <dualcore> or just a recalling itself when it completes
[23:57:46] <jrockjiggz> lmao25: $( "#ball_holder") .everyTime ( 10, function (){ //animation }
[23:58:03] <dualcore> but be careful with never ending loops
[23:58:27] <jrockjiggz> oh nm thats a plugin.. http://www.irengba.com/codewell/
[23:58:46] <donCams> what do you think would cause IE8 to throw up "Object expected" error? works fine in other browsers
[23:59:01] <dualcore> jrockjiggz: don't use a plugin let me show you
