[00:47:04] <motka> Hello. I wrote this "html5.js" tiny-library... If anyone has time to check it out: https://github.com/zlomerovic/html5.js - test it, give some feedbacks and comments on the thing, i'd be gradeful! Everything is explained in the github readme.md... Thanks!
[01:50:51] <AlexDSX> Hmmm, didn't know there was a jQuery mobile.
[02:00:49] <rcmaehl> How do I convert replaceAttr = jQ('[id^=object1]').attr("id"); to accept dynamic ids like object1-5325 and object1-1231414
[02:01:40] <rcmaehl> as it doesn't seem to in a script I have
[02:06:58] <jop008> Any expert on EXIF I am wondering is the display of my pictures wrong because of a browser bug?
[02:07:20] <jop008> It is about the exif oreientation tag https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=298619
[02:13:18] <jop008> is this bug still present in chrome http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=56845?
[02:14:26] <rcmaehl> Status: 	Fixed
[02:14:28] <rcmaehl> No
[02:14:33] <rcmaehl> It's not present afaik
[02:14:45] <jop008> But my photo is sideways
[02:15:01] <jop008> in safari also on iPad okay
[02:15:23] <jop008> so what to do?
[02:15:41] <rcmaehl> What is the image
[02:16:35] <jop008> a photo taken from iPHone
[02:17:09] <jop008> and my img tag only specifies the width
[02:18:28] <jop008> so all desktop browsers shows the picture sideways
[02:18:51] <jop008> a pitty that there is no attribute orientation
[02:18:54] <trinode> in jQuery Mobile, in the slide panel control, how do we allow the links to allow navigation to the same url, or at the very least close the menu?
[02:18:54] <okdamn> is it possible to hide the browser tab progress loading ?
[02:20:16] <okdamn> any clue dude?
[02:20:26] <okdamn> i submit a form which is inside an iframe
[02:20:35] <okdamn> but it shows the loading animation on browser tab
[02:20:48] <okdamn> is it possible to not show the animation on tab?
[02:22:01] <okdamn> help me
[02:22:05] <okdamn> say yes or not possible
[02:22:06] <okdamn> please
[02:24:34] <jop008> So if all browsers displays my picture sideways is exif info correct?
[02:30:59] <okdamn> guys is it possible to hide this animation http://i.imgur.com/8z8rlBy.png when submitting form in iframe with jquery ?
[02:39:03] <sammich> doubt it
[02:41:13] <jop008> If I save my picture as png orientation is okay
[02:41:47] <jop008> so after upload save the picture as png at the server?
[03:00:44] <motka> Hello. I wrote this "html5.js" tiny-library... If anyone has time to check it out: https://github.com/zlomerovic/html5.js - test it, give some feedbacks and comments on the thing, i'd be gradeful! Everything is explained in the github readme.md... Thanks!
[03:16:11] <okdamn> is it possible to submit upload files with ajax?
[03:32:47] <mordof> if I have my selector as $("button.first, button.second").one('click', function(){});    will the event handler be removed from both after I click on either of the buttons once? or will it individually be applied to both, and need both to be clicked before they're entirely removed?
[03:33:18] <motka> it will be removed individually for specific elemmnts you've placed in your selector string
[03:33:23] <mordof> hmm
[03:33:26] <motka> why haven't you tried it ?
[03:33:56] <mordof> i suppose I should have. the scenario i'm going to be using it in wouldn't have been easy to tell  if the behavior had worked - though I forgot to use the console xD
[03:34:08] <mordof> my  mistake
[03:34:15] <mordof> thinking about it now that would've been simple using the console
[03:41:09] <matijs> http://jsfiddle.net/wZAHN/ to see that the click handler fires only once for each mordof
[03:41:26] <mordof> mhmm
[03:43:58] <mordof> now to figure out how to remove the .one applied to either of the elements...
[03:44:06] <mordof> since using .on and .off removes my earlier handlers
[03:44:22] <mordof> oh, hm - nevermind
[04:05:24] <T|ASK> Hi, maybe wrong channel. Is there a tool with which I can live edit CSS files localy? Something like with firebog, but that my changes are actually saved to the corresponding file? Does anyone know a tool for this?
[04:06:21] <T|ASK> or do you know an IRC channel where I could ask this?
[04:56:10] <motka> can anyone review the demo: http://nadrealno.net/html5.js/
[05:08:34] <okdamn> hi any plugin or lib to use file reader on IE and android ?
[05:08:46] <okdamn> it is not fully suppoerted file reader :(
[05:14:47] <blueonyx> hi, i got an arry jquery tr objects like [$('<tr>'),...], how can i put them together to the equivalent of $('<tr></tr><tr>...')?
[05:14:51] <blueonyx> +of
[05:17:01] <blueonyx> rows.shift().after(rows.shift(),rows) doesnt seem to add all elements of the arry and looks scary :/
[05:26:44] <trinode> anyone have an idea on having both a back and a slide out menu on jQM? (stupid iPhones.... ;) )
[05:27:12] <arschmitz> back menu?
[05:27:19] <trinode> back button
[05:27:29] <trinode> they both normally live in the top left of the header
[05:27:35] <okdamn> any file reader api library for supporting IE and old browsers too?
[05:27:55] <arschmitz> either place button for panel on the right or do a controlgroup instead of a single button on left
[05:28:02] <arschmitz> or even just do two buttons on left
[05:43:45] <blueonyx> hmm  $('<table>').append(rows).find('tr') seems like a quite stupid workaround :(
[05:49:41] <boytoy> Is there a way to render jQuery Mobile pages *inside* an existing page, as opposed to opening them in new pages? See: http://jsbin.com/olohiy/2/edit
[05:54:56] <trinode> motka: you intend people write whole websites like that?
[05:57:35] <trinode> motka: Major concern if you do: Search engines.
[05:59:53] <sammich> he mentions that at the bottom of his about page
[06:00:57] <sammich> if you hate writing out HTML, just use emmet (or zen-coding, as it was called)
[06:01:06] <sammich> http://docs.emmet.io/
[06:09:00] <trinode> sammich: oooooOOOOooooh
[06:09:27] <trinode> sammich: any idea how on earth you download the plugin for PHPStorm ?
[06:09:43] <trinode> it's just a link to the PHPStorm site
[06:10:27] <trinode> sammich: nevermind it's built in
[06:11:18] <trinode> that's some nice s#!t
[06:25:27] <intellix> heh….. when you first show someone emmet :P
[06:25:34] <sammich> yup, it's a ridiculously simple syntax too
[06:25:51] <sammich> I only really use it to make table markup, heh
[06:27:16] <sammich> the guy pretty much made emmet
[06:28:03] <sammich> in spirit
[06:28:20] <trinode> Knowing I had it already, I wonder what else I've not seen in phpstorm / IDEA
[06:36:21] * trinode just did ul>li.myclass#myid$*100
[06:36:27] <trinode> THAT IS AMAZING!
[06:44:47] <Lightsaber> Hi, I am getting JSON data with Jquery/AJAX in getdata() function. This function:
[06:44:56] <Lightsaber> function getdata() {
[06:45:09] <Lightsaber> $.getJSON("ayarlar.asp",function(veri) {
[06:45:22] <Lightsaber> $(".wfloodnum").html("Şu anki değer:" + veri.floodwarno);
[06:45:31] <Lightsaber> });
[06:45:42] <Lightsaber> I show wfloodnum class with delaying 2 seconds when user clicks imput class. But wfloodnum class doesn't seem with delaying 2 seconds on my first click.
[06:45:54] <Lightsaber> It seems with delaying 2 seconds on my clicks after my first click. How can I fix it?
[06:48:31] <RandalSchwartz> 2 seconds was probably how long the fetch took
[06:58:35] * rodrigograca31 
[07:02:34] <danielepavinato> hi
[07:02:46] <danielepavinato> i'm new here
[07:02:55] <RandalSchwartz> greetings
[07:03:29] <sammich> hi new here
[07:03:36] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[07:03:56] <danielepavinato> is there someone available for answer to a question?
[07:04:20] <sammich> just ask
[07:04:21] <qdk> danielepavinato: So you have more than 1 question?
[07:04:26] <RandalSchwartz> don't ask to ask... :)
[07:04:38] <sammich> I don't know the darn bot commands
[07:04:41] <sammich> ?ask
[07:04:41] <b-ot> sammich: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:04:46] <sammich> there it is
[07:04:53] <danielepavinato> ok :)
[07:05:17] <danielepavinato> i'm following some jquery video tutorials
[07:05:33] <danielepavinato> and i'm a little confused on one piece of code
[07:05:54] <danielepavinato> what is the difference between this
[07:06:18] <danielepavinato> (function(){
[07:06:19] <danielepavinato> 		$('button').click(function(){
[07:06:19] <RandalSchwartz> the sound of one hand clapping!
[07:06:20] <danielepavinato> 			//$(this).data('file'); will not called every time but it will be saved in the stylesheet variable
[07:06:21] <sammich> don't paste code longer than one line in here
[07:06:22] <danielepavinato> 			var stylesheet = $(this).data('file');
[07:06:23] <danielepavinato> 			console.log(stylesheet);
[07:06:25] <danielepavinato> 			$('link').attr('href', stylesheet + '.css');
[07:06:26] <danielepavinato> 		})
[07:06:26] <RandalSchwartz> no paste!
[07:06:27] <sammich> dammit, too slow
[07:06:27] <danielepavinato> 	})();
[07:06:28] <danielepavinato> ops
[07:06:29] <danielepavinato> sorry
[07:06:33] <RandalSchwartz> please use jsfiddle.com
[07:06:36] <danielepavinato> sorry
[07:06:38] <danielepavinato> how?
[07:06:41] <sammich> ?paste
[07:06:41] <b-ot> sammich: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:06:48] <RandalSchwartz> oh - .net
[07:06:50] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:08:10] <danielepavinato> i pasted the code on jsfidle
[07:08:12] <danielepavinato> now?
[07:08:18] <sammich> hit 'save' at the top
[07:08:21] <sammich> and give us the new link
[07:08:32] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:08:53] <danielepavinato> http://jsfiddle.net/fN2dq/
[07:09:29] <RandalSchwartz> first one creates a scope
[07:09:50] <RandalSchwartz> if there are "var" before the body, they are persistent, but local scope
[07:10:03] <RandalSchwartz> without that outer wrapper, they are global ("document.foo")
[07:10:26] <RandalSchwartz> essentially creating closure vars
[07:10:45] <danielepavinato> ok, but i'm not sure why i have to use (function(){ FUNCTION })?
[07:10:48] <sammich> well really, both are closures
[07:10:52] <RandalSchwartz> true
[07:11:11] <RandalSchwartz> danielepavinato - for that example, it didn't matter
[07:11:11] <sammich> first is a closurception
[07:11:19] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:11:29] <RandalSchwartz> but suppose you want "var counter = 1", and inside the click handler, you increment counter
[07:11:42] <RandalSchwartz> with the first one, you put that line before the .click
[07:11:50] <danielepavinato> have you an example where it is neccessary
[07:11:51] <RandalSchwartz> and "counter" can't collide with any other use of "counter"
[07:12:04] <RandalSchwartz> in the second, you are creating a global use of "counter"
[07:12:09] <RandalSchwartz> I *am* giving you an exmaple
[07:12:16] <danielepavinato> ok :)
[07:12:20] <sammich> tbh, I'm not totally sure what the difference between the first (an IIFE) and the second one (looks like an inline <script> to me)
[07:12:32] <sammich> is between*
[07:13:01] <sammich> both are pretty much run ASAP
[07:13:09] <sammich> as I understand it
[07:13:20] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, both immediate
[07:13:28] <RandalSchwartz> might want to use .on (replaces .live)
[07:13:36] <RandalSchwartz> or put it inside a document-ready handler
[07:13:59] <danielepavinato> mmmm
[07:14:07] <danielepavinato> it's so complicated...
[07:14:11] <sammich> $(function) {}); // $(document).ready(function() {}); is run when the document is ready
[07:14:16] <danielepavinato> have patience pls
[07:14:18] <danielepavinato> :)
[07:14:23] <sammich> no worries
[07:14:34] <RandalSchwartz> we're patient, but you need to ask questions :)
[07:14:52] <RandalSchwartz> and we generally despise retyping entire docs ... one line at a time. :)
[07:14:58] <RandalSchwartz> ?book
[07:15:05] <RandalSchwartz> hmm. thought there was a booklist
[07:15:12] <RandalSchwartz> ?tutorial
[07:15:17] * RandalSchwartz sighs
[07:15:29] <sammich> generally, I'll use the first form, as I would build the page behaviours on load
[07:15:49] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - most of my code is inside a docready hook
[07:16:08] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:16:09] <sammich> but also, since that's an IIFE, you would use try to stick that at the end, before your body tag
[07:16:27] <danielepavinato> i think that is more clear then before
[07:16:42] <RandalSchwartz> you mean before </body> tag
[07:16:48] <RandalSchwartz> before <body> tag would be too early :)
[07:17:09] <sammich> yeah, I'd hoped the meaning would be more clear (end, before body tag)
[07:17:26] <RandalSchwartz> could interpret as "end of header, before body tag"
[07:17:30] <sammich> close tag, probably would've helped ;)
[07:18:08] <sammich> do you even need a head,body,html tag anymore?
[07:18:15] <danielepavinato> no thanks
[07:18:17] <danielepavinato> :)
[07:18:33] <RandalSchwartz> they are always optional... but why count on the browser to fix up your code. :)
[07:18:52] <sammich> I think it's in the new spec
[07:18:57] <sammich> that they're optional
[07:19:03] <danielepavinato> i don't wet follow you
[07:19:08] <danielepavinato> *yet
[07:19:21] <sammich> don't worry, I went off on a tangent
[07:19:32] <danielepavinato> ah ok :D
[07:19:38] <RandalSchwartz> happens a lot here.
[07:20:04] <RandalSchwartz> this is a discussion channel.  you ask a question, it inspires a discussion that may or may not answer your question. :)
[07:20:13] <sammich> it's what happens when you stop asking questions ;)
[07:20:29] <sammich> I get bored
[07:20:34] * RandalSchwartz wanders off for morning-ish activities
[07:20:57] <sammich> it's morning here too! except that it's 0:21 and I should be sleeping
[07:21:24] <sammich> RandalSchwartz: http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/syntax.html#optional-tags
[07:21:37] <danielepavinato> so, if i understood correctly, (function(){ FUNCTION })(); is the same as $(document).ready(function(){}) ?
[07:21:45] <sammich> no
[07:21:47] <paulvd> can anyone say why fancebox isnt working here, its very simple but no idea http://www.urbanwildlifecontrol.com/newsite/animals/squirrel-removal/
[07:21:49] <danielepavinato> doh!
[07:21:55] <paulvd> click on link construction ap
[07:21:56] <paulvd> gap*
[07:22:01] <sammich> don't worry, I asked the same question a few weeks back
[07:22:28] <sammich> (function() {})(); is run ASAP, regardless of what state the page is in
[07:23:01] <danielepavinato> what is ASAP?
[07:23:07] <sammich> as soon as possible
[07:23:28] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:23:40] <sammich> you can't rely on everything on the page being available, such as slow loading resources
[07:23:53] <sammich> so put dependances first
[07:24:01] <sammich> dependancies*
[07:24:04] <sammich> dependencies*
[07:24:07] <sammich> I forget
[07:24:51] <sammich> if you want to be absolutely safe, just stick with $(function() {});
[07:25:07] <danielepavinato> so i use this when i want to run something as soon as possible?
[07:26:04] <sammich> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[07:26:51] <sammich> pretty much
[07:27:07] <sammich> I'd stick jQuery inside the doc.ready though
[07:27:17] <sammich> just so you know that jQuery has loaded
[07:33:17] <danielepavinato> wait
[07:33:34] <danielepavinato> what i have to do?
[07:34:01] <sammich> put all of your jQuery inside the doc.ready
[07:34:16] <sammich> just to be easy on yourself, put everything inside doc.ready
[07:35:04] <danielepavinato> you mean $(document).ready(function(){ … }) ?
[07:35:09] <sammich> yes
[07:35:27] <danielepavinato> instead of (function(){}()) ?
[07:36:05] <sammich> like I said, if you're going to use jQuery, put it inside doc.ready
[07:36:22] <RandalSchwartz> or you can use $(function () { .... });  just to be more terse.
[07:36:26] <RandalSchwartz> since that works the same way
[07:36:32] <sammich> yeah, they're exactly the same thing
[07:36:58] <sammich> didn't use that one because it's just a $ sign away from confusing it with the other one
[07:38:17] <RandalSchwartz> I prefer it, also because it can be used for conflicting $ problems
[07:38:34] <RandalSchwartz> jQuery(function ($) { code that uses $ });
[07:39:11] <danielepavinato> so you don't suggest me to use this (function(){}()) ?
[07:39:20] <sammich> well, either form can use noConflict
[07:39:28] <sammich> not unless you know what you're doing
[07:39:48] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:40:20] <sammich> gotta go
[07:40:25] <sammich> good luck/have fun
[07:40:38] <danielepavinato> for starting i'll use $(function(){ … })
[07:40:41] <danielepavinato> ok
[07:40:43] <danielepavinato> night
[07:40:48] <RandalSchwartz> not night here
[07:40:55] <RandalSchwartz> it's 7:40 am
[07:41:06] <danielepavinato> ops ok :)
[07:41:16] <danielepavinato> have you sleeped?
[07:41:21] <sammich> 12:41 am, mmk?

[07:50:25] <danielepavinato> see you soon
[07:51:42] <RandalSchwartz> Resig is/was a big Perl fan
[08:07:09] <mablae> Hi there!
[08:08:07] <mablae> I am searching for a plugin that monitors scroll position and kicks events I could hook onto to do sth...
[08:08:14] <Soltis> Hm. Sammich's little toy has a rather big bug.
[08:08:40] <mablae> Any small and good implementations ?!
[08:08:50] <RandalSchwartz> mablae - you mean, other than the raw scrollevent handler?
[08:09:14] <mablae> RandalSchwartz, I never coded against scroll handler..
[08:10:10] <RandalSchwartz> ... http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[08:10:11] <mablae> This is what I want: User scrolls down, LogoDiv gets new CSS class (smaller), Scrolling back up should revert it..
[08:10:29] <mablae> RandalSchwartz, So I dont need any plugins?!
[08:10:38] <mablae> Great, I will try it
[08:10:42] <RandalSchwartz> there's an example there
[08:10:45] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - that's core
[08:11:05] <mablae> Sorry, I am not that exp. with Jquery...
[08:11:09] <mablae> Thank you!
[08:11:37] <RandalSchwartz> that's ok.  I was once not as experienced as well.
[08:11:46] <RandalSchwartz> that's why I try to give back here when I can
[08:12:08] <mablae> :)
[08:13:06] <mablae> Is the scroll position reported in eventData ?!
[08:13:28] <mablae> ... I should just try
[08:13:38] <mablae> Not ask such lame questions! :-)
[08:14:35] <mablae> Thanks again, RandalSchwartz
[08:16:33] <RandalSchwartz> $('*').scroll(function(e) { console.log(this, e) });
[08:16:38] <RandalSchwartz> then watch the console
[08:16:49] <RandalSchwartz> you can even do that in jsfiddle.net :)
[08:16:55] <mablae> Yeah...
[08:30:53] <okdamn> hi do you know how can i get file size and dimensions using jquery or File Reader API ?
[08:34:27] <okdamn> uh?
[08:40:00] <defk0n> Hi, there im wondering. is it possible to include javascript code inside a json string and let it run via eval? how would that look?
[08:40:37] <defk0n> lets just say this code is not public
[08:40:50] <RandalSchwartz> eval should work just fine
[08:41:11] <RandalSchwartz> but why not just send the code down in the first place
[08:41:15] <RandalSchwartz> or use a jsonp call
[08:41:27] <defk0n> how would that look thou. mystring: { public function(){alert('hi there'}}
[08:41:38] <defk0n> i want to code the client dynamically
[08:41:40] <RandalSchwartz> "public"?
[08:41:45] <defk0n> to instruct it.
[08:41:47] <RandalSchwartz> what language are you in?
[08:41:51] <defk0n> javascript
[08:41:52] <defk0n> nodejs
[08:41:55] <defk0n> jquery
[08:42:04] <RandalSchwartz> oh maybe that means something to node
[08:42:15] <RandalSchwartz> but that's not javascript proper
[08:42:44] <defk0n> hm.. yea trim the public bit
[08:42:51] <defk0n> thats me messing up
[08:43:04] <RandalSchwartz> so describe what you want to happen?
[08:43:28] <b1nary> hey guys I'm implementing a sortable accordon and I have everything nicely... headers grouped with content in a wrapper and everything.. but the headers are mixing with each other and when I sort them, they disappear and lose functionality.. no idea why
[08:43:31] <RandalSchwartz> the code sent to the client must contain an eval string somewhere
[08:43:44] <RandalSchwartz> and then it can call ajax, get some json, select a string to eval, and eval that
[08:43:48] <okdamn> how do i get the image file size and dimensions using file Reader API guys?
[08:43:51] <okdamn> any help?
[08:44:12] <RandalSchwartz> you can't bury arbitrary javascript inside json and trigger something just on download
[08:44:16] <RandalSchwartz> the client side code must help
[08:44:17] <defk0n> like i want the client, which i control parse a json response. where the server encoded javascript.
[08:44:20] <okdamn> come on dudesss
[08:44:36] <RandalSchwartz> is file Reader API jquery?
[08:44:40] <defk0n> yea i can script the client side. i just dont want to script everything client side
[08:45:05] <RandalSchwartz> this - https://github.com/Jahdrien/FileReader
[08:45:36] <defk0n> so if i eval a json string on the client side it would execute the javascript?
[08:45:40] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[08:45:44] <RandalSchwartz> wait
[08:45:49] <defk0n> but im more interested in how that would look. im kinda new to js
[08:45:52] <RandalSchwartz> eval an *element* from json as object
[08:46:15] <RandalSchwartz> actually, an insecure quick way to go from json to an object is eval. :)
[08:46:40] <defk0n> yeah i know what you mean. im not talking objects im talking full blown functions
[08:46:53] <RandalSchwartz> { evalme : "function () { ... }" }
[08:46:55] <RandalSchwartz> sent that json
[08:46:58] <RandalSchwartz> convert it to an object
[08:47:04] <RandalSchwartz> then eval theobject.evalme
[08:47:14] <defk0n> thats 2 fkng legit man.
[08:47:20] <defk0n> i luv json
[08:48:06] <defk0n> so eval($.JSONparse(data[evalme])) ?
[08:48:23] <RandalSchwartz> no
[08:48:25] <RandalSchwartz> you have that insideout
[08:48:43] <RandalSchwartz> myobect = $.JSONparse(data)
[08:48:48] <RandalSchwartz> eval myobject.evalme
[08:48:59] <defk0n> thnx
[08:49:06] <RandalSchwartz> wait - data might already be an object
[08:49:19] <defk0n> no data would be the json right
[08:49:27] <defk0n> from a http perspective
[08:49:31] <defk0n> just a string
[08:49:33] <defk0n> responsetext
[08:49:48] <RandalSchwartz> so yeah, then you need to do what I said
[08:49:55] <defk0n> yer
[08:50:00] <RandalSchwartz> need to get it from json string to real object
[09:11:24] <okdamn> is it possible to get the file size having the base64 encoded data ?
[09:12:29] <RandalSchwartz> okdamn - jquery itself doesn't know files
[09:12:33] <RandalSchwartz> what plugin are you uising?
[09:13:25] <okdamn> File Reader API
[09:13:30] <RandalSchwartz> where is that from?
[09:13:53] <RandalSchwartz> this - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[09:13:56] <RandalSchwartz> that's not jquery
[09:14:30] <RandalSchwartz> readAsBinaryString would likely give a string. the length of that string is the size of the file
[09:14:44] <RandalSchwartz> but that's just me reading the docs to you
[09:15:17] <RandalSchwartz> so is there a jquery question as well, or just a javascript question?
[09:15:22] <okdamn> RandalSchwartz:  oh damn thanks a lot dude
[09:15:39] <RandalSchwartz> just good google-fu
[09:24:22] <nastyCreeper> hi
[09:24:30] <nastyCreeper> i'm having weird bug with websockets
[09:25:19] <nastyCreeper> they are fine with sending small messages from client to server, but once message reaches ~1Kb, it arrives to server only 20-30 second after browser sent it
[09:25:40] <nastyCreeper> any ideas?
[09:27:17] <RandalSchwartz> receiver not keeping up with sender probably
[09:30:49] <nastyCreeper> RandalSchwartz: what do you mean? receiver doesn't even receive the message for 20-30 seconds
[09:31:01] <nastyCreeper> ( problem exists only in client->server way)
[09:31:58] <RandalSchwartz> if it's a bidrectional problem maybe you have some sort of blocking I/O
[09:32:37] <RandalSchwartz> I don't know much aboout websockets though.  Only sockets in general
[09:32:40] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i'm seeing a weird double scrollbar thing happening if i resize my window vertically to with a certain (small) height, any ideas? http://www.robertsimpson.co.uk/static/new.htm
[09:32:43] <RandalSchwartz> and zeromq sockets ::)
[09:33:10] <nastyCreeper> RandalSchwartz: nope, server remains responsive and new requests arrive correctly (unless they are 1Kb or larger)
[09:33:18] <nastyCreeper> new websocket requests *
[09:33:24] <RabSimpson> it only seems to happen in firefox (tested only in ff and safari)
[09:33:26] <nastyCreeper> meaning connects and messages
[09:33:54] <RabSimpson> also fine in chrome
[10:12:35] <okdamn> hi i do $(body).append(element);
[10:12:48] <okdamn> after then alert($(element).width());
[10:12:51] <okdamn> why won't work?
[10:13:03] <okdamn> it always alert me 0
[10:13:25] <okdamn> i mean it's a live created element but i should be able to keep his own dimensions when already created :/
[10:13:30] <okdamn> what about please?
[10:14:41] <crazydiamond> okdamn, hi
[10:14:51] <crazydiamond> okdamn, what's your element?
[10:14:54] <okdamn> crazydiamond:  hello
[10:14:58] <okdamn> it's an img element
[10:15:12] <crazydiamond> okdamn, has it "src" specified?
[10:15:20] <okdamn> yes base64
[10:15:22] <okdamn> src
[10:15:30] <crazydiamond> okdamn, btw, what browser are you using?
[10:15:32] <okdamn> i would just like to create that to get his width and height
[10:15:34] <okdamn> FF
[10:15:46] <crazydiamond> okdamn, have you got Firebug?
[10:15:53] <okdamn> sure
[10:16:12] <crazydiamond> okdamn, so, can you see your element and it's actual dimesions?
[10:16:38] <okdamn> sure
[10:16:43] <okdamn> i just do
[10:16:44] <okdamn> $('body').append('<img src="'+_img+'"  style="display:none;" id="img-tester" />');
[10:16:45] <okdamn> 			alert($('#img-tester').width());
[10:16:52] <okdamn> but it returns 0
[10:17:00] <okdamn> while real image is 640px wide
[10:17:12] <crazydiamond> okdamn, "display: none"
[10:17:31] <okdamn> also if i remove diplay:none
[10:17:42] <okdamn> already tryed so strange
[10:19:30] <gasd2> hey
[10:19:46] <okdamn> crazydiamond:  already tryed without that
[10:19:48] <okdamn> same story
[10:20:15] <crazydiamond> okdamn, isn't it inside of another element with display: none?
[10:20:32] <okdamn> nope
[10:20:40] <okdamn> appended to body hidden
[10:20:55] <gasd2> quick question, I need to animate an element with query false, and use a complete function
[10:20:59] <gasd2> $(this).animate({'top':'20px'}, 200, function() { alert('done'); });
[10:21:05] <gasd2> That works fine without query false
[10:21:13] <gasd2> Add query false...
[10:21:14] <gasd2> $(this).animate({'top':'20px'}, {queue: false, duration: 200}, function() { alert('done'); });
[10:21:21] <gasd2> And complete doesn't get called
[10:22:25] <ko2in> gasd2: complete function should also be same block ..
[10:22:38] <ko2in> {queue: false, duration: 200, complete: function(){}}
[10:22:55] <crazydiamond> gasd2, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13313724/jquery-animate-with-function-wont-queue-false the same as ko2in answered
[10:23:09] <RandalSchwartz> okdamn - instead of string "+", probably best to build elements using object to describe attribute
[10:23:12] <RandalSchwartz> much safer
[10:23:38] <crazydiamond> okdamn, also, can you share some document somehow?
[10:23:45] <crazydiamond> okdamn, *whole
[10:24:21] <tada> hello
[10:24:26] <tada> any activity here?
[10:24:30] <gasd2> perfect, works great, thanks ko2in and crazy
[10:24:32] <crazydiamond> hi tada
[10:24:37] <crazydiamond> 'sup?

[10:33:46] <crazydiamond> tada: and html please
[10:35:14] <tada> one sec
[10:37:06] <tada> crazydiamond:http://pastebin.com/JQEYvpRy
[10:37:30] <tada> the autocomplete works but not correctly
[10:38:56] <Guest66489> hi
[10:39:40] <tada> have you got any answer for me
[10:40:58] <crazydiamond> tada: one sec
[10:41:07] <Guest66489> toggle() has changed from 1.3. What's a good way to do if I want to do click and toggle combination, but I do not want to hide the contents?
[10:41:32] <Guest66489> I just want to toggle position.
[10:42:02] <scar> er
[10:45:09] <crazydiamond> tada: can you create js fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/  for test?
[10:45:28] <tada> i would try, not very good at jquery but give me a min
[10:54:00] <crazydiamond> tada: take a look at mine http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/28WcG/
[10:54:46] <tada> ok
[10:56:01] <tada> crazydiamond: you seems to work but mine does not work
[10:56:16] <tada>  <!-- Load jQuery -->         <script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery/jquery-1.7.min.js"></script>         <script type="text/javascript" src="/jquery-ui/js/jquery-ui.custom.min.js"></script>         <!-- common jQuery date picker plugin -->
[10:56:26] <tada> oops did not meant to paste here
[10:56:48] <tada> i ma using jquery 1.7 and jquery-ui 1.8
[10:57:09] <tada> is there anything different you did....
[10:57:20] <tw2113> .next
[10:57:23] <tada> i cannot spot the difference
[10:57:28] <tw2113> ?next
[10:57:32] <tw2113> bah, ignore me
[10:57:36] <tada> crazydiamond ?
[10:58:10] <crazydiamond> tada: I don't think jquery version matters, but you can test
[10:59:46] <tada> what version you are using
[10:59:52] <tada> the code you dumped i mean?
[11:02:00] <tada> crazydiamond: ?
[11:02:32] <crazydiamond> that's UI
[11:02:38] <crazydiamond> tada:
[11:03:51] <crazydiamond> tada: щту ыус
[11:03:55] <crazydiamond> tada: one sec
[11:04:34] <crazydiamond> tada: the code I posted is tag-it's js and css from there https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it
[11:04:48] <tada> ok
[11:05:01] <tada> let me preprare mine jsfiddle and i would get back to you
[11:05:22] <crazydiamond> tada: and jquery version that I use in my fiddle is 10.0.1 (you can check on sidebar)
[11:13:04] <tada> crazydiamond: the css looks different
[11:13:13] <tada> have you added more stuff to it.?
[11:13:25] <tada> https://raw.github.com/aehlke/tag-it/master/css/jquery.tagit.css
[11:13:48] <tada> this does not have addition lines which i can see in your jsfiddle
[11:14:34] <crazydiamond> tada: I've added two CSS
[11:21:09] <Ibis> How can I detect the height, more like how much height is being used in an element.
[11:21:33] <Ibis> http://jsfiddle.net/Uk4ny/1/      <---- The height going from body to DONE.
[11:21:58] <Ibis> But it's not an element though. It's just text filling up space.
[11:22:33] <crazydiamond> Can anyone suggest analog of spinner from jQuery UI, that has ability to display strings instead of specific values? In my example I have two widgets, spinner and select, where select shows string "Foobar" when values is -1, but I want to use spinner to not to bound values to ones from list. http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/qk6bn/
[11:25:17] <defk0n> does anyone know how to change javascript functions? like for example i want to pipe console.log() to a file.
[11:26:19] <defk0n> or pipe it to a string for that matter.
[11:26:29] <defk0n> just not to a debug console
[11:27:34] <crazydiamond> defk0n, I'm not sure, but you can try sth like console.prototype.log = function ( ... ) { ... }
[11:27:45] <Jairoprez> hi david
[11:28:00] <Jairoprez> are you there??
[11:29:17] <defk0n> hm, crazydiamond what does that do x_x i have never seen prototype
[11:30:44] <crazydiamond> defk0n, JS is language that uses prorotypes
[11:33:17] <crazydiamond> defk0n, try the following http://dpaste.com/1312653/
[11:33:26] <crazydiamond> defk0n, in your console
[11:35:26] <RandalSchwartz> prototype is a more flexible version of classes
[11:35:38] <RandalSchwartz> imagine a singleton class for every object
[11:36:46] <defk0n> yer i see, its not working though.
[11:36:46] <defk0n> console.constructor.prototype.log = function(str){str + "Proto"};
[11:37:34] <defk0n> console.constructor.prototype.log = function(str){return str + "Proto";};
[11:37:42] <defk0n> does it work for you?
[11:38:44] <defk0n> holy shit
[11:58:47] <Ibis> How do I get the height of text that's occupying the purple colored box (or other elements that takes up height)?
[11:59:21] <Ibis> http://jsfiddle.net/Uk4ny/1/
[12:20:24] <shoky_> Ibis: http://jsfiddle.net/Uk4ny/2/
[12:23:53] <shoky> Ibis: also should probably add overflow:hidden to .body or something
[12:26:04] <Ibis> Darn it, the content breaks out of the purple box.
[12:27:20] <shoky> hence the overflow:hidden
[12:27:21] <Ibis> I am doing a javascripted stickyfooter because there are no current solution that allows this:  1. Stickyfooter.  2. 100% height div inside the content area.
[12:28:09] <Ibis> Opera browser would work, until I add a <!DOCTYPE> :( And I need it.
[12:28:46] <shoky> you can also instead add a overflow:auto  to .content:  http://jsfiddle.net/Uk4ny/3/
[12:34:07] <Ibis> shoky, This is what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/Uk4ny/         Note that it used tables. (I also did the CSS & div version of tables), it will work in the opera browser until I add a DOCTYPE, then everything breaks.
[12:39:06] <Ibis> OR achieve something similar to this:        calc(100% - #header - #footer);
[12:41:14] <caitp> can someone explain to me why "              $.ajax({type:"POST",data:JSON.stringify(data),contentType:"application/json; charset=utf-8",dataType:"html", " -- always seems to be sending "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ?
[12:41:18] <caitp> I don't get it
[12:43:16] <dannydagger> does anyone know how i can use jQuery to wrap around an absolute element?
[12:46:50] <dabear> caitp: debugged it yet? in the jquery source, set a break on the following line: if ( s.data && s.hasContent &&
[12:47:17] <caitp> i'd like to, but my server seems to have died :(
[12:47:20] <dabear> see if any of those statements are false
[12:56:01] <caitp> dat split
[12:57:28] <boytoy_> lulz
[12:57:35] <boytoy_> nono
[12:57:40] <boytoy_> dat spliff =)
[12:58:56] <caitp> heh, maybe once they create odorless ones, then I'll get back into that again
[12:59:37] <defk0n> Does anyone know a good library to calculate dates including timezones
[13:00:16] <boytoy_> I was wondering is there a way to open a jQuery Mobile page *inside* another jQuery Mobile page? Please see: http://jsbin.com/olohiy/2/edit
[13:04:21] <boytoy_> caitp: cool
[13:04:42] <dannydagger> how can i make a div resize responsively with jquery? can anyone help me with this?
[13:04:44] <boytoy_> caitp: we can smoke at my place any time though, i got excellent air conditioning
[13:05:13] <caitp> it's not cool if it smells like weed, that ruins it :(
[13:05:39] <boytoy_> yeah i think i know what u mean
[13:06:03] <boytoy_> like sometimes you like to drink red wine but hate the way it colors your mouth and teeth?
[13:08:09] <caitp> totally
[13:08:16] <caitp> but this is all very off topic ;)
[13:08:49] <boytoy_> yeah you're right ;)
[13:08:55] <boytoy_> i enjoyed our little chat though
[13:33:12] <b1nary> hey guys quick question... after I create a new element ON the mouse pointer, I want to (without letting the mouse button up) move the div with the mouse
[13:33:30] <b1nary> right now I have it as draggable and it drags, but only after a mouseup and mousedown happens again
[13:33:47] <b1nary> ive tried focus(), trigger('focus')
[13:38:37] <caitp> yeah... what the hell :( it requests content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and I have no idea why
[13:39:04] <caitp> like where is content-type getting mutated
[13:39:07] <caitp> and why ;-;
[13:45:03] <PPOS_Amilo> hi
[13:45:31] <RandalSchwartz> "it" requests content-type [form]
[13:45:33] <RandalSchwartz> what is "it"?
[13:45:41] <shoky> caitp: it's sending application/json here.. http://jsfiddle.net/CtFhu/
[13:46:02] <PPOS_Amilo> need help with $.parseJSON(html), i have always "undefined" on return
[13:46:37] <shoky> why are you json-parsing html
[13:47:08] <PPOS_Amilo> need help with $.parseJSON(data), i have always "undefined" on return
[13:47:13] <PPOS_Amilo> if you prefer
[13:47:29] <RandalSchwartz> what's in "data" when you do that?
[13:47:40] <shoky> what's data. are you getting any errors. etc. jsfiddle
[13:48:14] <RandalSchwartz> "post" is always a "form"
[13:48:26] <RandalSchwartz> so yeah, it has to be a form type
[13:48:34] <RandalSchwartz> servers don't understand raw json :)
[13:48:46] <caitp> depends on the server
[13:48:46] <RandalSchwartz> remove your contenType
[13:48:55] <RandalSchwartz> well - which server do you have?
[13:48:59] <shoky> post can be application/json
[13:49:09] <RandalSchwartz> the content of the form might be
[13:49:13] <caitp> this is express.js/connect
[13:49:14] <RandalSchwartz> but not the structure of the form
[13:49:19] <shoky> wat
[13:49:37] <caitp> connect's body parser is supposed to deal with json, if the content-type is set correctly
[13:49:38] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - not a mainstream webserver
[13:49:49] <RandalSchwartz> sorry - not up on all the variations
[13:49:54] <shoky> `demo @ caitp
[13:49:54] <b-ot> caitp: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:50:16] <caitp> I'll pastebin some code, sec.
[13:50:24] <RandalSchwartz> not pastebin... jsfiddle.net
[13:51:30] <caitp> I don't think jsfiddle will be very helpful
[13:51:40] <PPOS_Amilo> you can see : http://jsfiddle.net/kdENM/
[13:52:09] <caitp> yes, but that doesn't mean anything within the context of an application
[13:52:12] <caitp> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2682234
[13:52:34] <RandalSchwartz> sure - so what's in html in that sub?
[13:52:35] <amirite> shh
[13:52:37] <amirite> no talking allowed
[13:52:41] <RandalSchwartz> what does your console.log say?
[13:52:47] <PPOS_Amilo> yes
[13:52:47] <RandalSchwartz> is it valid JSON?
[13:53:04] <caitp> if it's not valid json, then someone needs to file a bug against chromium/v8
[13:53:08] <caitp> and ff25 as well
[13:53:12] <RandalSchwartz> wait - you're not using the output of $.parseJSON?
[13:53:32] <RandalSchwartz> why are you invoking it in a void context?
[13:53:41] <RandalSchwartz> var data = $.parseJSON(html)
[13:53:47] <RandalSchwartz> console.log(data.description)
[13:54:02] <caitp> that doesn't even make sense, randal
[13:54:03] <PPOS_Amilo> ok thanks you
[13:54:23] <RandalSchwartz> why do you think that $.parseJSON would edit its arg? :)
[13:54:40] <caitp> I'm not using parseJSON anywhere
[13:54:46] <RandalSchwartz> talking to PPOS_Amilo
[13:55:12] <caitp> my understanding is that I need to send this data as a string, hence JSON.stringify
[13:55:20] <caitp> but the same effects happen when trying to pass it as an object
[13:55:38] <caitp> however, printing the stringified json looks perfectly valid
[13:55:46] <PPOS_Amilo> i'm newie with jquery
[13:56:00] * RandalSchwartz says "TL;DR" to the mozilla pastebin
[13:56:29] <caitp> heh, well then jsfiddle would be TLDR for you too wouldn't it :p
[13:56:47] <RandalSchwartz> which means you haven't yet reduced the problem to the point where people can help you
[13:57:16] <caitp> I know that the data I'm passing is valid
[13:57:30] <caitp> what I don't know is why $.ajax is sending x-www-urlencoded
[13:57:38] <caitp> instead of the specified contentType
[13:58:30] <caitp> no exceptions are tripped on or anything
[13:58:52] <shoky> caitp: need an actual testcase. the code looks fine
[14:07:37] <dipser> caitp where is the "url"?
[14:08:44] <caitp> it defaults to the current page, dipser
[14:12:42] <caitp> http://jsfiddle.net/kdENM/1/ << transmits as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
[14:14:05] <shoky> caitp: that's the form submitting, not ajax
[14:14:14] <caitp> oh, because I forgot to add return false
[14:14:16] <caitp> which is in the original source
[14:14:23] <caitp> but yeah it's not going to change anything
[14:14:27] <shoky> sure it is
[14:14:46] <shoky> Content-Type:application/json
[14:14:47] <xboi209> how do i get the html of a img tag?
[14:15:20] <systemfault> xboi209: You mean, a html representation of the DOM element?
[14:15:23] <shoky> xboi209: $('img').prop('outerHTML')
[14:15:29] <dipser> Content-Type	application/json; charset=UTF-8
[14:15:51] <caitp> It's posting twice now, here
[14:16:01] <xboi209> ty, ive been using .html() which didnt work D:
[14:16:05] <caitp> once with urlencoded, and once with application/json

[14:23:29] <Soltis> Is there a way to make a single option in a select multiple unselectable?
[14:23:53] <Soltis> It only has to work in very recent browsers; anything more than a year old doesn't matter.
[14:24:35] <Eviltwin> Soltis: Did you try disabled="disabled" on the <option> element?
[14:24:36] <dipser> disabled?
[14:26:56] <Soltis> Eviltwin: No, I just saw that.
[14:27:10] <Soltis> Eviltwin: For some reason searching gave me some singularly retarded results.

[14:34:25] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/3mTTm/ < why this isnt working
[14:34:27] <Tomashe> i dont get it
[14:35:59] <Tomashe> suddenly some basic things i can not preform LOL
[14:37:38] <Ibis> shoky, I found a solution: http://jsfiddle.net/ptq4q/             THAT's what I want to do. 100%-able stickyfooter.
[14:38:23] <shoky> Tomashe: .EFCLOSE doesn't have any .search-inside  inside it
[14:39:41] <pixelpimp> Tomashe: why do you not just do $('.EFCLOSE').click(function() { $('.search-more').hide(); })?
[14:41:27] <QuanSai> f
[14:43:57] <garbagecollectio> does .done go before .when?
[14:45:37] <shoky> garbagecollectio: that question doesn't mean much.. what's the trouble
[14:45:59] <garbagecollectio> the trouble is i have multiple deferrerd with callbacks out and about
[14:46:41] <garbagecollectio> i need to execute something after they ALL return the proper stuff from the server and run their callbacks
[14:47:09] <garbagecollectio> in callbacks are currently in a .done
[14:47:23] <b1nary> can someone please give me some insight on adding events to dynamically created content?
[14:47:25] <shoky> $.when(dfd1,dfd2,...).done( function(data1, data2, ...) { ... } )
[14:47:44] <shoky> or  $.when.apply($, arrayOfDfds).done(...)
[14:48:56] <shoky> b1nary: you can add event handlers to the new content after it's added. or delegate the event handling to an ancestor element using a special form of .on(...)
[14:49:03] <garbagecollectio> shaky, but i already have a .done out on each object
[14:49:05] <shoky> ?on @ b1nary
[14:49:09] <garbagecollectio> shoky*
[14:49:26] <shoky> garbagecollectio: doesn't matter. tho to be sure, show some code
[14:49:26] <garbagecollectio> will what you gave me fire after the .done for the individual calls is complete?
[14:49:30] <garbagecollectio> ok
[14:49:31] <garbagecollectio> one sec
[14:49:59] <garbagecollectio> shoky: https://gist.github.com/TheStriving/0afa59a2f8192a14216b
[14:50:04] <garbagecollectio> lines 11-16 are where i make these promises
[14:50:09] <garbagecollectio> they are in a loop
[14:50:29] <garbagecollectio> I'm wondering if what u gave me gets called after those .done functions or not
[14:50:42] <mike_f> Anyone out here use jstree with jquery 1.9? I'm having some 'teething troubles'.
[14:50:55] <garbagecollectio> also I'm not sure how to do what you are asking
[14:51:47] <shoky> garbagecollectio: i don't really understand what you're doing on line 12.. where are you returning that to
[14:52:06] <garbagecollectio> shaky it just gets returned by a self executing function
[14:52:11] <garbagecollectio> like i have to namespace
[14:52:15] <garbagecollectio> those promises
[14:52:17] <garbagecollectio> cause its in a loop
[14:52:34] <b1nary> shoky: I've tried that, but nothing is working so far... I'm trying to add a dblclick to a div I create dynamically --> http://pastebin.com/xC6HV7Dk
[14:52:36] <shoky> ok so it gets returned, but nothing is done with it
[14:52:49] <garbagecollectio> right
[14:52:53] <garbagecollectio> but then in the next iteration of the loop
[14:53:05] <garbagecollectio> you'll see on line 10
[14:53:13] <Tomashe> fucking idiot me
[14:53:15] <garbagecollectio> its a different url
[14:53:24] <Tomashe> i forgot that the ineet selector sould be inside
[14:53:24] <shoky> so?
[14:53:25] <Tomashe> BAHH
[14:53:49] <garbagecollectio> shaky how do i do the when with multiple ajax calls when they are defined iteratively like i am doing
[14:54:03] <Tomashe> this is what happpened when u dont code jquery for quite some time
[14:54:04] <Tomashe> lol
[14:54:14] <garbagecollectio> do i push stuff into an array
[14:54:19] <garbagecollectio> and then add the array of objects to when?
[14:54:24] <shoky> garbagecollectio: i'd use $.map instead of that for loop, then you don't need the self executing function, and you can just return the promise
[14:54:43] <shoky> garbagecollectio: then use $.when.apply on the new array returned from $.map
[14:55:04] <shoky> garbagecollectio: and yes that's essentialy a nicer way of pushing stuff into an array
[14:55:37] <Ibis> Tomashe, what are you trying to do?
[14:55:53] <garbagecollectio> shaky, one sec let me try that
[14:55:55] <garbagecollectio> shokyU
[14:55:57] <garbagecollectio> shoky*
[14:56:30] <shoky> b1nary: make a jsfiddle. also i don't see you using the event-delegation form of .on()
[14:56:39] <Guest16926> shoky, did you see my solution?
[14:57:10] <shoky> Guest16926: if you're Ibis, then yes
[14:57:18] <b1nary> shoky: fiddle coming up
[14:57:18] <Guest16926> :D What do you think?
[14:57:26] <shoky> Guest16926: i liked mine better
[14:57:43] <Guest16926> Okay.
[14:57:44] <garbagecollectio> shaky, how do i use $.when.apply on the new array i just made
[14:57:53] <garbagecollectio> an array of ajax calls
[14:58:16] <shoky> garbagecollectio: $.when.apply($, arrayOfDfds).done(function() { ... })
[14:58:53] <shoky> the done callback will get a data argument for each deferred, you can use 'arguments' if you wanna loop it
[14:59:46] <garbagecollectio> cool
[15:00:06] <garbagecollectio> stocky, are u sure this fires after the individual .done
[15:00:07] <garbagecollectio> i have set up
[15:00:10] <garbagecollectio> I'm setting up a new gist
[15:00:20] <garbagecollectio> https://gist.github.com/TheStriving/9f6a36637d3a5c23f6f1
[15:00:53] <shoky> garbagecollectio: i'm pretty sure about that
[15:03:08] <garbagecollectio> shaky it seems to have worked
[15:03:13] <garbagecollectio> nice job man
[15:07:17] <shoky> thx
[15:09:22] <b1nary> shoky: http://pastebin.com/xC6HV7Dk
[15:09:46] <b1nary> nvm missed the capital c
[15:09:53] <b1nary> it works in the fiddle but not in my actual code
[15:10:01] <b1nary> but I did the same thing in my code -_-

[15:14:32] <b1nary> http://pastebin.com/ku4tXfqb
[15:15:08] <b1nary> I can get to as far as .pad .pad-task
[15:15:18] <b1nary> but I need .pad .pad-task .task-text
[15:18:22] <Grus> With the HTML please? I'm not going to understand what that code does, or the usecase of it.
[15:18:31] <RandalSchwartz> ?pad

[15:45:39] <caitp> okay so, I have a dialog -- it is pulled from the server via ajax, and it has a form on it. What I want to happen is, when the client submits the form, the response is also pulled in via ajax. If it contains any error flash messages, the dialog should be re-rendered in its entirety, with the flash message at the top, and basically retry the entire process. if it contains any info flash messages, I want to just render
[15:45:39] <caitp> the response with the info flash and abort the loop -- and in any other case, just close the dialog
[15:45:50] <caitp> but I'm not sure how I can drive an asynchronous "loop" :(
[15:49:22] <caitp> would setTimeout(0, the-looping-function) be adequate?
[15:51:45] <fllr> I have a list of 10 or so images sized so that there are always 4 images being displayed at all times by the browser in a grid. Each one of those 4 plugins is a page. Are there any plugins that would allow me to go through each one of those pages as if in a slide show without having to wrap those images around a wrapper?
[15:52:12] <LaMakina> caitp: you need to use error callbacks to handle that logic.
[15:52:43] <caitp> error callbacks for what?
[15:53:20] <LaMakina> you make your request. then you get a response. depending on that response you need to handle that logic client side. and re-render appropriately.
[15:53:45] <LaMakina> I'm not sure what setTimeout can do for you here.
[15:54:09] <caitp> right, but the "error" response (eg a network error) would not really be important, just aborting the loop would be fine in that case
[15:55:28] <LaMakina> what would the-looping-function do ?
[15:55:54] <LaMakina> do you have a snippet of code we can look at. it would help to understand your problem.
[16:14:34] <scottyob> Howdy, I'm struggling a little bit with a .click() being used in a .load(this['href'], function() { … }     It appears the click event only fired intermittently.  I thought the .load function() was only supposed to fire after the document was fully altered?
[16:15:20] <xec> caitp: in order to learn recursion, you first need to learn recursion
[16:15:36] <LaMakina> :)
[16:15:54] <scottyob> xec: Lol!
[16:17:08] <xec> scottyob: i'm not following, you trigger a .click() on something after the .load() ajax is completed?
[16:17:51] <scottyob> xec: yep, the .load will load something with a button in it, I want to make sure after it's finished loading, I bind those buttons to do stuff
[16:19:30] <xec> scottyob: well, as long as it's inside that function (second parameter to the load method) it should be fine
[16:20:04] <scottyob> xec: that's what I thought, but if I put a breakpoint in there it never fires, or, it does, but only intermittently
[16:27:36] <scottyob> .live works a treat! :D
[16:31:02] <eddiemonge> dont use live
[16:31:34] <LaMakina> .on()
[16:33:06] <xec> scottyob: what eddiemonge says. it's deprecated and removed from latest jQuery. see http://api.jquery.com/live/#entry-longdesc for other ways of doing the same thing
[16:33:52] <xec> scottyob: as long as you're using 1.7 or newer, .on() is preferred
[16:35:03] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i'm having an issue with my orientation detection which is resulting in sticky scrolling on (at least) ios devices (not sure about android or windows). here's my url: http://www.robertsimpson.co.uk/static/new.htm i can't see where i'm going wrong if someone wouldn't mind having a look. thanks in advance :)
[16:36:25] <paulvd> special characters dont work in input onfocus onblur? like organization's ?
[16:37:10] <asoliman> how can i bind an on click to items with a specific id now and in the future?
[16:37:20] <asoliman> similar to the deprecated .live function
[16:37:36] <LaMakina> on()
[16:38:32] <eddiemonge> ? event delegation
[16:38:51] <eddiemonge> asoliman: read api.jquery.com/on
[16:38:57] <xec> asoliman: $(thisAlwaysExists).on("click", "#futureId", function...)
[16:39:24] <asoliman> xec: eddiemonge: thank you both, i just found that through the deprecated live documentation. I must have overlooked it
[16:41:48] <RabSimpson> does everyone in here specifically avoid answering questions which relate to phones or maybe just iphones? i've asked various questions over the past couple of days, every one of which has been ignored. what's the score here?
[16:43:11] <tw2113> maybe no one has an answer
[16:44:22] <RabSimpson> tw2113: that's probably the case, i just find it odd that nobody has responded for nearly 3 days with every question i've asked. i was getting paranoid that i was +b.
[16:44:34] <tw2113> also: weekend
[16:45:08] <scottyob> Thanks xec, eddiemonge
[16:46:52] <caitp> xec: don't make foolish assumptions. now, I can't keep recursing forever, and I can't impose a limit on the number of recursions that are tried
[16:56:41] <xec> caitp: hehe, i made few assumptions, and none of them foolish ;)
[16:57:03] <caitp> no, you made one assumption, which is incredibly foolish
[16:57:09] <xec> caitp: i meant the recursion should happen in the callback, under the right circumstances
[16:57:32] <caitp> I believe I've solved the problem, though
[16:57:45] <drag0nius> how would i synchronously retrieve string from server?
[16:57:48] <xec> caitp: if you want to limit the number of times it should happen, it would be no problem to implement
[16:58:03] <xec> drag0nius: why synchronously?
[16:58:09] <xec> ?async @ drag0nius
[16:58:21] <drag0nius> basically i want to retrieve translated string
[16:58:25] <caitp> well, I am not really expecting a stack overflow to happen, and if it did happen it wouldn't really be my problem
[16:58:31] <drag0nius> and display it somewhere
[16:59:22] <xec> drag0nius: okay. what's stopping you? what have you tried?
[16:59:51] <drag0nius> how would i get value returned by $.ajax or $.get?
[17:00:05] <xec> drag0nius: have you seen the examples in the docs?
[17:00:08] <eddiemonge> they return a promise
[17:00:11] <eddiemonge> is that what you want?
[17:01:00] <eddiemonge> drag0nius: and im pretty sure you dont want to do a synchronous pull
[17:01:45] <eddiemonge> drag0nius: but you might want http://api.jquery.com/load/
[17:09:34] <xec> drag0nius: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40
[17:51:31] <caitp> hmm, FF25 and chromium seem to get different results from $.find()

I've tried just setting the value but it wont let me set a value a value greater than max,  But if I change max then the scale is totally wrong
[20:18:24] <ericfilkins> maybe use an if statement:  if (value == 100) {value * 1000000} or something

[23:53:05] <okdamn> hi, why this won't alert 'ant' ??? http://pastebin.com/zQgkmnhY
[23:53:09] <okdamn> what's wrong sorry?
[23:56:48] <shaundunne> you pass 'ant' into the function call, but you don't assign it within the function
[23:57:31] <shaundunne> is it supposed to be assigned to _which or which?
[23:58:15] <okdamn> shamess_:  _which is the global var and which is the passed valued to the method
[23:58:24] <okdamn> can't see nothing wrong :(
