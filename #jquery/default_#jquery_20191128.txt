[07:05:26] <herol3oy> hi. how can i chnage the latin numbers (the timer) to persian/farsi digits? > https://bit.ly/2pUNYim
[07:18:30] <Cork> herol3oy: devepns on the lib you use for the timer
[07:18:40] <Cork> and it might not support it
[16:57:12] <tona> hello everyone how could I show extra information , I saw in datatable one green icon and red icon where you can expand and collapse extra columns in each row, https://jsfiddle.net/asunje4m/1/
[17:13:13] <tona> hello everyone how could I show extra information , I saw in datatable one green icon and red icon where you can expand and collapse extra columns in each row, https://jsfiddle.net/asunje4m/1/
[17:13:13] <tona> I would like to expand column 5 and column 6
[17:15:45] <robertmaxrees> tona why not do what the docs for datatables show?
[17:16:04] <robertmaxrees> also: that fiddle doesn't seem to have datatables included.
[17:16:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nqvumbdy/1/ looks like your setup is invalid.
[17:17:51] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.  you're already in ##javascript - nvm :)
[17:18:59] <tona> robertmaxrees how could I show the green icon showed in datatables to show more columns, expand and collapse for more columns
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> it's kinda uncool to ask the same question in multiple channels.
[17:19:41] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're getting help in ##javascript already :) good luck!
[18:46:17] <sine0> hey folks
[19:17:01] <sine0> I have an issue for a few hours now. im trying to work with add-to-cart.js jQuery script for woocommerce. basically im trying to see how/where it updates the cart in realtime. I am 99% there. product is added backend and I have the cart fragments in the ajax response, and I have run a few of the trigger/functions but its not visually updating
[19:17:09] <sine0> https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/assets/js/frontend/add-to-cart.js
[19:18:25] <sine0> this is what i have harvested in my own script https://bpaste.net/show/ZOO3W
[19:19:56] <sine0> I had an issue some time ago where i made an update to the code and it was actually changed but somehow the page was not triggered a refresh and i could not see the update, im wondering if that is happening now
