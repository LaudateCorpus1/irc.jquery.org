[00:14:11] <IdanAdar> Try again: Hello! Any idea why does this fail: http://pastebin.com/apX9Xnzi but this doesn't: http://pastebin.com/vEXW7exp - I'd like the animation to occur only if pressing a specific link in the menu, and not any link from the menu...
[00:20:02] <odyniec> IdanAdar: paste the HTML of the menu
[00:21:26] <IdanAdar> It's generated by WordPress, but it looks like this: http://pastebin.com/NVFmZwhx
[00:23:52] <odyniec> IdanAdar: What does $("#menu a[href='#top']").length say?
[00:25:04] <nate_black> hi all
[00:25:09] <nate_black> could someone help me with a little jquery problem please?
[00:27:21] <nate_black> could someone help me with a little jquery problem please?
[00:29:20] <nate_black> could someone help me with a little jquery problem please?
[00:43:32] <IdanAdar> odyniec: any thoughts?
[01:05:09] <odyniec> IdanAdar: asked you a question ^
[02:42:36] <jned> You know how you can attach custom data- prepended attributes, how do you read them or get their values?
[02:45:37] <ravenzz> jned $(elem).attr('data-foo')
[02:45:56] <jned> ravenzz, thx. actually, I think you can just do $(elem).data('foo');
[02:46:12] <jned> nope didn't work
[02:46:23] <ravenzz> data- attributes are strings
[02:46:48] <ravenzz> and inline element attrs so, attr() is fine
[02:46:54] <jned> yep it worked, they can only be lowercase it seems
[02:47:04] <ravenzz> jned you may want to have a look at the data() documentation
[02:47:25] <jned> I had it set to docID but then when I looked dom, it showed up as docid, so I changed it to .data('docid') and it worked
[02:47:29] <jned> ravenzz, hx
[02:47:32] <jned> ravenzz, thx
[03:01:25] <para_> Hi guys, I am trying to implement a route planner, is there any jquery/Js plugin/api where i could do this, some basic needs are like, given a list of cities, need a best route to cover them, the distance ,time it takes etc
[03:01:37] <para_> and i need some way to optimize the journey so that the route is not unnecessarily long, like going to a -> b -> c -> d but a & d are closer so it should reoptimize to a -> d - > b -> c
[04:05:10] <jned> how do I delete all siblings from the current h2 (ie. this) upto the next h2?
[04:12:50] <shoky> ?api nextUntil
[04:12:50] <b-ot> shoky: .nextUntil(): Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed. http://api.jquery.com/nextUntil/
[04:14:59] <jned> shoky, thx
[04:22:47] <jned> shoky, its seems to skip images
[04:27:40] <jned> .on() doesn't work for me.  I have some links that I handle with .click(function(){..., and I when I load them into the dom and click them, it fails, so I tried to change it to .on("click", function(){... but it still fails
[04:31:25] <shoky> jned: you probably want to use event delegation. e.g.  $('#container').on('click', '.mylink', function() { ... })
[04:31:34] <shoky> read about it in the docs for .on
[04:32:10] <jned> shoky, thx
[04:32:11] <shoky> and uh, nextUntil doesn't skip images
[04:33:04] <jned> its seems to be skipping images for em
[04:33:26] <shoky> `demo
[04:33:26] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:33:54] <shoky> the images aren't siblings, i guess
[04:37:03] <jned> shoky, I hope you can make sense of it: http://jsfiddle.net/w4tJM/
[04:37:48] <shoky> jned: i don't know what you want me to do with that. it's not a demo
[04:38:15] <jned> shoky, I know, I can't really setup a demo on jsfiddle
[04:38:21] <laura`> hi i'm trying to learn by doing this http://f6design.com/journal/2011/08/06/build-a-parallax-scrolling-website-interface-with-jquery-and-css/ but i'm having difficulty adding a bounce effect onclick, after the scroll to the correct anchor.  i think i need to add easing but maybe someone can point me in the right direction?
[04:38:49] <jned> shoky, but you can see that the image is a sibling
[04:38:54] <shoky> i'm sure you can if you really want to. all you said was it's skipping images - that's all i need to see
[04:39:17] <shoky> minimal demo is best..
[04:40:24] <shoky> jned:  .empty()  doesn't remove the elements
[04:40:34] <shoky> you might want .remove()
[04:40:43] <jned> shoky, ooooh, ok let me try that
[04:41:53] <jned> shoky, yep, that did it, it works now. Thanks so much.
[04:42:13] <shoky> np
[04:45:40] <jned> shoky, see this $(".deleteButton").on("click", function(e){... it only works on the "getEntries" append()'ed html which get loaded on page load, but no on the "newEntry" prepend()'ed html which is loaded on the fly.  I'd better see .on() page actually
[04:45:40] <|Freeman|> how can someone continue a jQuery selection? for example var panelHolders = jQueryGlimpse('.panel-holder'); and then panelHolders('.preview-show') <- this does not work
[04:47:19] <jned> .live() was easier cause you could attach to element that weren't in the dom yet
[04:49:09] <|Freeman|> ah, use the .find(selector) function, got it
[05:04:27] <shoky> jned: you can achieve the same thing with .on()  you just have to know how. i gave you an example before
[05:04:44] <jned> shoky, yeah true, thx
[05:04:46] <shoky> jned:  what .live() did was use  $(document) instead of $('#container')
[05:24:27] <raymank26> hi all. I have this code http://pastebin.com/YgxuKCyS After the 20th line my "used_objects" wasn't change. How to fix that?
[05:31:12] <Minizarbi> Hi everybody, is there something in jquery to "delete" all CSS in a webpage ? (and then make new ones)
[05:31:46] <sammich> you mean <style> or .css()?
[05:32:09] <Minizarbi> Both ?
[05:32:31] <sammich> what is it you're trying to achieve with this?
[05:33:07] <Minizarbi> And then your page looks like when you deactivate style in firefox.
[05:34:53] <sammich> you're looking for something a browser extension can provide?
[05:36:38] <c00kiemon5ter> hello all
[05:36:45] <Minizarbi> An maybe, I'm making an userscript
[05:37:23] <sammich> next question
[05:37:48] <sammich> you want to remove them, and then revert it?
[05:37:56] <c00kiemon5ter> um, I'm having trouble with .scrollTop(); I want to get the distance from the document's top to an element, so I try: $('#foo').scrollTop();  but I get zero
[05:38:36] <c00kiemon5ter> $('body').scrollTop(); seems to work, but nothing else I tried
[05:38:52] <Minizarbi> I want to removes them, and then make new ones :D
[05:38:55] <sammich> scrollTop is the position of the scrollbar
[05:39:07] <c00kiemon5ter> aah :S that makes sense then
[05:39:20] <sammich> you want position() or offset()
[05:39:25] <sammich> i can't remember which one it is
[05:39:28] <c00kiemon5ter> alright, I'll look into those
[05:40:08] <sammich> Minizarbi: what do you want to do that many browser extensions already do for you?
[05:40:09] <c00kiemon5ter> what I'm really after is scrolling inside a div which contains list/ul/li to some li I have marked with a class (or id)
[05:40:31] <Minizarbi> I don't know x)
[05:40:39] <sammich> c00kiemon5ter: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollIntoView
[05:40:58] <c00kiemon5ter> yeah, that's what I'm using now
[05:41:10] <sammich> so what's the issue with it?
[05:41:52] <c00kiemon5ter> seems to work correctly :) but my header is fixed and when I use it with true as an arguement the element is hidden behing the header
[05:42:08] <c00kiemon5ter> so I would like to scroll some ammount minus the header height
[05:42:11] <sammich> ahhh :D
[05:42:16] <sammich> yes, I'm familiar with that
[05:42:43] <c00kiemon5ter> other than that scrollIntoView is nice
[05:43:47] <sammich> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4884839/how-do-i-get-a-element-to-scroll-into-view-using-jquery
[05:43:49] <sammich> 2nd answer?
[05:44:08] <doug65536> c00kiemon5ter: you don't need a plugin for that. jquery supports animating scrollTop
[05:44:15] <sammich> you'll have to target your overflow div though
[05:44:27] <c00kiemon5ter> I'll give it a try :)
[05:46:18] <doug65536> c00kiemon5ter: something like $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: $(..thingToScrollIntoView..).offset().top - $(..myheader..).outerHeight()});
[05:46:57] <sammich> doug65536: does that work with an overflow div though?
[05:47:31] <doug65536> sammich: I just got here, I didn't know it was a scrollable div
[05:48:19] <doug65536> sammich: what do you mean "overflow div"
[05:48:43] <doug65536> overflow: scroll ?
[05:49:13] <sammich> an element with a scrollbar
[05:49:17] <sammich> auto/scroll
[05:53:28] <doug65536> sammich: how can a fixed header be a problem with a scroll div?
[05:55:06] <sammich> the fixed header sits above the content
[05:55:52] <doug65536> yeah, the word "header" gave that away. what content
[05:56:16] <sammich> dunno, I'm just telling him what I think he wants to hear
[05:56:30] <sammich> his content, presumably
[05:56:55] <doug65536> seriously?
[05:56:56] <sammich> maybe he's got a side panel
[05:57:59] <sammich> I don't exactly have his site to look at. He wanted to scroll something into view with scrollIntoView() with an offset
[05:58:43] <sammich> I'm not designing his site for him
[05:58:53] <fattest> how do you collapse all the tabs on load? currently it opens the first panel, i don't want it to do that. http://jsfiddle.net/R55vg/45/
[05:59:03] <c00kiemon5ter> there is no reason to argue really
[06:00:05] <jned> can some one visit c72.ca and tell me if it loads?
[06:00:36] <fattest> jned:  It's not just you! http://c72.ca looks down from here.
[06:00:46] <jned> fattest
[06:00:55] <fattest> jend?
[06:01:03] <jned> fattest, thx
[06:01:25] <fattest> anyone?
[06:02:10] <jned> 247zilla offers free hosting, but then they block you traffic.  Its been like that for a month
[06:02:36] <jned> They said ddos attack, so they are blocking free accounts
[06:02:39] <fattest> jned: don't use that then
[06:02:50] <jned> yeah I know
[06:03:02] <ChaZ> fattest $('#collapseOne').collapse("hide");
[06:03:35] <fattest> chaz: thank you so much
[06:03:44] <ChaZ> does it work?
[06:03:47] <fattest> indeed it does
[06:03:49] <sammich> it's amazing what you find in the documentation
[06:03:58] <fattest> what documentation?
[06:04:01] <fattest> jned: use http://www.000webhost.com/
[06:04:06] <sammich> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#collapse
[06:04:08] <ChaZ> or googling :D
[06:45:19] <Hodds_> hey all,
[06:46:44] <Hodds_> just wondering if anyone can explain to me how I can use .post to retrieve html code and then display it on the page?
[06:47:53] <Hodds_> or can it only retrieve xml data.
[06:53:35] <shoky> Hodds_: it can retrieve any data the webserver outputs
[06:54:47] <Hodds_> yeah, thats what I've been able to work out.  I've been able to get it to send data and process it, but my problem is working how to get the data back in html format....
[06:55:32] <Hodds_> my script sends back the html code... but I cant get it to display for some reson...
[07:04:33] <HarryPitfall> just do a $('element_selector').html(response_of_the_post)
[07:08:43] <Hodds_> how do you define reponse_of_the_post is that via the function()?
[07:08:48] <Hodds_> in .post?
[07:10:15] <shoky> have you looked at the docs?
[07:10:41] <Hodds_> yeah, I've been trying to work it out for a couple days now....
[07:10:52] <shoky> the first example shows it..
[07:11:13] <shoky> $.post( "ajax/test.html", function( data ) {  $( ".result" ).html( data );  })
[07:11:24] <Hodds_> 			// send requests
[07:11:24] <Hodds_> 			$.post("../jquery/shout.php", { shout: NewShout }, function(result) {
[07:11:24] <Hodds_> 				
[07:11:24] <Hodds_> 				// output result
[07:11:24] <Hodds_> 				$("#shout").html(result);
[07:11:25] <Hodds_> 			});
[07:11:37] <shoky> use a pastebin dude
[07:11:44] <Hodds_> sorry
[07:12:45] <shoky> well.. that's how you do it
[07:13:21] <Hodds_> hmmm ok,
[07:14:05] <Hodds_> so that should change the data if there is anything there right.
[07:14:58] <raj> instead of `myFunc(callback) { doStuff(); callback()}`, I should instead use a $.promise object with no parameters needing to be passed to myFunc()?
[07:15:02] <shoky> if there is a #shout in the DOM, and if the post is successful, then yea
[07:16:38] <Hodds_> yeah its there... its a <div id="shout"></div>
[07:16:40] <shoky> raj: you should return a promise that gets resolved whenever the callback would've been called
[07:17:57] <raj> ok, so basically no more need for callback arguments
[07:18:09] <raj> this is gonna really clean some shit up
[07:19:27] <raj> and if I was to iterate over $('.somecrap') with .each(i,el), to collect $(el).data(), that should need a promise object, yes? (as in, it's not super fast?)
[07:19:51] <shoky> no, that's a synchronous loop
[07:19:59] <shoky> if you want something to happen after it, just put it after it
[07:20:10] <raj> really!
[07:20:12] <raj> great
[07:20:30] <raj> what else is synchronous in jq?
[07:20:42] <shoky> eh
[07:20:42] <sammich> fetching data is async
[07:20:45] <sammich> everything else is sync
[07:20:45] <shoky> better q is what is async
[07:21:05] <sammich> fetching remote data*
[07:21:15] <shoky> setTimeout is also async
[07:21:30] <sammich> yeah, except for a few obvious ones
[07:21:33] <sammich> that's not jq :)
[07:21:34] <shoky> and jquery's animations
[07:21:50] <raj> but dom manipulations are async, right?
[07:21:57] <shoky> no
[07:21:58] <sammich> no?
[07:22:14] <sammich> that's really not something you want to be async
[07:22:24] <sammich> that would be a nightmare
[07:22:48] <raj> so I can trust that all DOM manipulations are done before my ajax request?
[07:23:01] <sammich> well, it's not async, so, yes
[07:23:03] <shoky> if you ran them before, sure
[07:23:33] <raj> yes, so I really don't know what's async
[07:23:44] <raj> is there a complete list of async functions?
[07:23:57] <shoky> it's better to get a feeling for it
[07:24:34] <shoky> async is for stuff that you need to wait for a response for, that the browser does in the background and notifies you when it's done
[07:24:34] <shoky> like a timeout
[07:24:36] <shoky> or an ajax request
[07:24:37] <sammich> things that take 'real time' generally are async
[07:24:49] <sammich> animations, requests, intervals
[07:25:36] <shoky> a jquery animation is just a lot of setTimeouts + DOM manipulations
[07:26:01] <sammich> for your sake, just assume everything is sync, and keep what we've mentioned above is async
[07:28:38] <raj> awesome
[07:28:39] <raj> thank you!
[07:29:15] <sammich> and if you want a quick answer
[07:30:28] <sammich> put the code in question before it, then some sync code after it
[07:30:31] <lianzinho> guys, what is the best way to restore a whole element after some dom modifications?
[07:30:44] <sammich> restore?
[07:30:45] <lianzinho> it does not restore after the first time: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=fsiC8myjD7
[07:32:19] <T13|> What are you doing to the element?
[07:33:06] <lianzinho> change some CSS and html content
[07:34:01] <T13|> Should be able to set css back by changing .css('')
[07:34:25] <lianzinho> yes, this I know, but its not so practical
[07:34:37] <lianzinho> I want to be able to fully recreate the initial stage
[07:35:27] <T13|> Reload the page or you need to store the initial values someplace to be able to set them all back.
[07:36:18] <lianzinho> yes, I've done that
[07:36:22] <lianzinho> look at the fiddle
[07:39:28] <lianzinho> the catch is, why clone only works once?
[07:39:51] <shoky> you're only calling it once
[07:39:56] <lianzinho> I thought it would store the whole element and be able to fully restore it
[07:40:15] <shoky> it stores one copy
[07:40:25] <sammich> but using it expends it?
[07:40:30] <lianzinho> yes
[07:40:30] <shoky> then you put that copy in the DOM
[07:40:31] <lianzinho> heuaheuae
[07:40:33] <shoky> it's still that same one
[07:41:22] <lianzinho> when I put it in the DOM its over? I need to copy again? does not make sense
[07:41:40] <shoky> if you want another copy then you need to copy again
[07:41:50] <shoky> makes much sense
[07:42:09] <sammich> he wants a permanant original copy to refer to
[07:42:18] <lianzinho> exactly
[07:42:26] <shoky> FTFY
[07:42:34] <sammich> use .html()
[07:42:37] <sammich> and use delegates
[07:42:59] <sammich> .data() won't copy though
[07:43:09] <shoky> or just clone..
[07:44:14] <lianzinho> so
[07:44:19] <lianzinho> I have to make a copy
[07:44:22] <lianzinho> to keep
[07:44:23] <sammich> of a copy
[07:44:27] <lianzinho> and if I want to use
[07:44:33] <lianzinho> I have to copy the copy
[07:44:34] <lianzinho> hahahah
[07:44:37] <lianzinho> yes?
[07:44:47] <lianzinho> So I won't expend the original
[07:45:11] <sammich> okay, well I get that
[07:45:46] <cnap> how can I use the toggle function for a buttons states switching ?
[07:45:47] <shoky> same as if you want to copy a file on your filesystem
[07:46:07] <shoky> or a real document you wrote with a pen
[07:46:27] <cnap> I wanna have 2 cases depending on clicks. If its clicked once do something, if its clicked 2nd time do something else..
[07:46:32] <cnap> toggling between states
[07:46:54] <sammich> well, I'd just copy and paste and paste and paste
[07:47:14] <sammich> not copy and paste and copy and paste and copy and paste...etc
[07:47:21] <lianzinho> shoky: got that, difference with moving and copying
[07:47:49] <shoky> sammich: you'd copy, paste, change the thing you just pasted,  then you want another copy of the original so you copy the copy you made of the original, again
[07:48:05] <shoky> remembver that he's also doing .replaceWith   you'd need to do that with your files too ;P
[07:49:25] <shoky> i guess you have a point, it's not the same ;p
[07:49:41] <sammich> it's abstracted away, sure
[07:50:21] <lianzinho> yes, I got the principle, but not exactly why it expend the copy
[07:50:22] <sammich> it's weird because in my mind it reads var copy = $('.keepmeforlater').clone();
[07:50:22] <lianzinho> hehehe
[07:51:10] <lianzinho> yes, it should keep this "copy" forever
[07:51:12] <sammich> copy = do with me what you want
[07:51:12] <sammich> put me anywhere
[07:51:14] <sammich> it's probably just an expectation vs. english thing
[07:51:19] <sammich> wait
[07:51:31] <sammich> a logic thing
[07:51:56] <sammich> you expect a variable to hold a copy to use until you set it to null
[07:52:01] <shoky> the difference is there's no "clipboard" here where the copy is kept (and every time you paste, ths copy is copied)
[07:52:04] <sammich> but you didn't set it to know
[07:52:05] <raj> shoky, why don't the docs of .each() mention synchronicity?
[07:52:06] <sammich> null*
[07:52:08] <sammich> whut
[07:52:22] <sammich> raj: because it's a given
[07:52:31] <sammich> raj: you're still thinking the wrong way around
[07:52:38] <raj> ok
[07:52:45] <sammich> assume all things are sync, then only you look for async
[07:52:46] <raj> so just assume everything is
[07:52:46] <raj> ok
[07:52:57] <raj> I've got to unf**k my code now
[07:53:02] <sammich> hear hoofbeats, don't think zebras
[07:53:07] <sammich> think horsies
[07:53:28] <sammich> unless, you're in the african savannah
[07:53:36] <sammich> you're not in the African Savannah, are you?
[07:53:50] <lianzinho> shaky but the variable should work as a clipboard, shouldn't it?
[07:54:00] <lianzinho> shoky:
[07:54:01] <lianzinho> hehhe
[07:54:04] <shoky> lianzinho: no, it should work as a variable
[07:54:31] <sammich> the thing is that these are references
[07:54:42] <sammich> and jQuery is magic
[07:54:50] <sammich> does stuff in the background you don't see
[07:54:51] <lianzinho> shoky: yes, which does not get rid of the value that is stored once used.. heheh
[07:55:03] <shoky> wat it's not jquery related
[07:55:10] <sammich> sure it does
[07:55:12] <lianzinho> sammich: yes, I imagine, but its very counter intuitive....
[07:55:51] <sammich> so, is a clone just a reference to the original element, then
[07:55:57] <shoky> huh no
[07:56:00] <shoky> it's a copy
[07:56:15] <shoky> var y = x.clone()
[07:56:16] <sammich> so, how is it that it only works once
[07:56:34] <sammich> it must know to refer to the original element
[07:56:37] <shoky> you only call it once..
[07:56:45] <shoky> no it doesn't
[07:56:50] <lianzinho> look
[07:57:00] <lianzinho> if you hit the check button
[07:57:21] <lianzinho> you'll see that after the second change, the copy becomes the changed element
[07:57:26] <lianzinho> no more the original
[07:57:34] <lianzinho> so it's not a copy anymore
[07:57:35] <sammich> that
[07:57:42] <lianzinho> that's what blew my mind
[07:57:43] <raj> ok, I'm writing a jq plugin that takes `beforeAction` and `afterAction` parameters in the object parameter. I should program these with promise objects?
[07:57:46] <shoky> the original is gone, right
[07:57:52] <shoky> because you called .replaceWith on it
[07:58:15] <sammich> so this is jQuery, doing it's thing
[07:58:31] <lianzinho> so, that can't be a copy
[07:58:33] <sammich> raj: or you handle them as callbacks
[07:58:35] <lianzinho> just a reference
[07:58:36] <shoky> no it's not jquery
[07:58:40] <lianzinho> like a pointer
[07:58:54] <lianzinho> if I change the original, it catches the change
[07:59:29] <raj> sammich, just wondering what the usual way to handle this scheme is
[08:00:05] <shoky> sammich, lianzinho: http://jsfiddle.net/C9TMw/1/
[08:00:11] <shoky> it has nothing to do with jquery
[08:00:12] <raj> is there a clean way to do it so I can leave my code relatively as is (and without putting in anonymous functions for callbacks)
[08:00:25] <sammich> admittedly, I've not done any work on deferreds but I know I current do this with callback()
[08:00:39] <raj> I essentially want o.beforeAction to be run synchronously
[08:01:08] <sammich> callbacks are sync
[08:01:09] <raj> make sure beforeAction() returns a promise object
[08:01:25] <sammich> unless the callback itself has async code
[08:01:29] <sammich> but that's not your problem
[08:01:47] <sammich> well
[08:01:50] <sammich> never mind
[08:01:54] <sammich> ignore me
[08:02:54] <shoky> raj use callbacks for those
[08:03:42] <sammich> they're not going to be anon functions anyway, not necessarily
[08:03:44] <lianzinho> shoky: yeah, the same principle applies here. If I create another copy of the copy it works...
[08:03:44] <shoky> well, depends what "Action" is and if it happens just once or many times or wtf are you doing
[08:04:24] <lianzinho> shoky: the thing is… "do not use the original, keep it inside the safe" hehehe
[08:04:43] <sammich> yeah I get that
[08:05:02] <gregf_> hello, i needed to make an ajax call and poll every 5 seconds. but if i get a success i need the polling to terminate. atm i have a setInterval(fetch_ipc_config_data,5000); <= but this gets called even after a success
[08:05:09] <lianzinho> it must be a reference then… not a copy
[08:05:16] <lianzinho> imagine this in C
[08:05:18] <lianzinho> hehehe
[08:05:27] <raj> ok, so what's a good way to run o.beforeAction() synchronously http://jsfiddle.net/Buq3C/
[08:06:11] <shoky> raj no need for $(this) btw
[08:06:31] <raj> ah k
[08:07:22] <shoky> the best way to run something synchronously is.. to run it ;p
[08:07:43] <shoky> there isn't anything else you could possibly do ;p
[08:08:12] <sammich> raj: again, you're thinking you have a problem before you even have it
[08:08:35] <raj> but I wanna make sure other Stuff happens afterwards
[08:08:47] <raj> in case someone does an ajax call in beforeAction
[08:08:51] <sammich> before(); during(); after()
[08:08:57] <gregf_> w
[08:09:04] <shoky> raj if someone does an ajax call there, that's their business
[08:09:07] <sammich> that's their own problem
[08:09:17] <raj> how might they solve that
[08:09:40] <shoky> solve what.. you haven't given any real context
[08:09:51] <shoky> NOT SURPRISINGLY
[08:10:52] <sammich> raj: someone provides a handler that has async code in it. You know what happens when that code gets run? it's going to return immediately back to your code
[08:11:10] <raj> the beforeAction function is passed to the plugin on initialization. $('#container').myplugin({'beforeAction':before}), and therefore overrides the `beforeAction` function I've created
[08:11:42] <raj> ya but in case my code depends on the return value of beforeAction()
[08:11:58] <sammich> we understand what you're aiming to do, we're telling you don't worry about what people do with their handlers
[08:12:05] <jop008> How can I do this for (var key in field) {  if (isnull(field.key)) {  field.key = "";     }
[08:12:20] <jop008> I want to check if field.dbfield is null
[08:12:23] <raj> sammich, so if they do an ajax call, everything can break
[08:12:28] <shoky> === null  ?
[08:12:31] <jop008> field.key => undefined
[08:12:43] <sammich> well, make them run that code BEFORE, they call your code
[08:12:44] <jop008> field.dbfield = value
[08:12:55] <raj> interesting
[08:13:12] <sammich> if (!nullObj) nullObj = '';
[08:13:52] <raj> so there's no programming pattern to handle this scenario?
[08:14:06] <shoky> "scenario"
[08:14:23] <raj> ya, where you might allow the user to run async code
[08:14:33] <shoky> sure there is
[08:14:37] <shoky> no problem with it
[08:14:54] <raj> I admit I'm trying to abstract this plugin way too much, but just as a learning experience I'm not interested
[08:15:06] <raj> *I'm interested
[08:15:18] <sammich> the user would have to return a promise object to you
[08:15:24] <lianzinho> raj: what is the plugin for?
[08:16:40] <raj> just my website
[08:16:47] <raj> which is why it's crazy I'm trying to abstract it so much
[08:17:15] <shoky> raj take a look at jquery-ui autocomplete's "source" option
[08:17:25] <lianzinho> raj: I see…
[08:17:56] <shoky> you can supply a callback to it,  and jquery-ui calls the callback , passing to it a "response" callback, that you call when you're done retrieving the data
[08:18:04] <shoky> i think that's the pattern you're looking for
[08:18:17] <raj> yes it is
[08:19:53] <shoky> but what sammich said about the user giving you a promise  is another way of doing the same thing.. sounds interesting tho i don't think i've ever seen that approach
[08:19:55] <raj> ok, it's making me dizzy
[08:19:57] <raj> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/tests/unit/autocomplete
[08:20:00] <raj> enough on that I think
[08:20:03] <shoky> heh
[08:20:12] <shoky> i didn't mean to look at their source code
[08:20:14] <shoky> just at the API
[08:20:24] <sammich> yay, I contributed
[08:20:48] <raj> I'm real l33t, I just read source
[08:21:44] <sammich> too bad that's not the right dir
[08:21:56] <shoky> but yea, passing a callback that will be passed a callback - can be dizzying
[08:22:33] <sammich> probably needs a param to go 'isDeferred'
[08:23:16] <sammich> hmm, can you find out if something is a deferred object
[08:23:23] <sammich> instanceOf?
[08:23:52] <shoky> i think you can just check if it has the deferred/promise methods
[08:23:57] <shoky> iirc there isn't a better way
[08:24:43] <sammich> if (!obj.deferredThing())
[08:30:17] <gregf_> hello, can anyone help please?
[08:31:12] <gregf_> here's a part of the function i need to poll for till i get a success. atm, i'm not sure if this is the right way. jquery is fine, this ajax bit is new to me :/
[08:33:18] <gregf_> http://jsfiddle.net/LpQYq/
[08:33:53] <anoob> may i talk about qunit here or where should i do it?
[08:35:10] <raj> gregf_, looks fine on first glance
[08:35:14] <raj> what seems to be the problem?
[08:35:35] <gregf_> is the function cached somewhere?
[08:35:44] <shoky> greg_f: you didn't close the first $.each
[08:35:52] <raj> no, you can create a named function though
[08:36:00] <raj> gregf_, what do you mean cached?
[08:36:03] <gregf_> shoky: well, i could'nt see any syntax error :/
[08:36:19] <shoky> you closed it after the "error" part instead of before it
[08:36:34] <shoky> gregf_: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {
[08:37:06] <gregf_> raj: i make an invalid request with an invalid token as in: http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A123456
[08:37:09] <shoky> click TidyUp on the top and it'll be easy to see
[08:37:18] <gregf_> the ajax cal fails
[08:37:24] <gregf_> s/cal/call/
[08:37:48] <gregf_> next i change the token to token_id=A123456 and save(no need to restart the server)
[08:38:04] <shoky> first fix the syntax errors :\
[08:38:08] <gregf_> but the ajax call request still uses the url http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A123456
[08:38:48] <gregf_> shoky: well thats just the skeleton, i may have missed a bracket or 2 here or there when pasting :/
[08:39:08] <shoky> then paste without missing, otherwise we're talking about 2 different codes..
[08:39:21] <gregf_> shoky: sure, sorry bout that :/
[08:39:55] <gregf_> but yeah, the ral problem. the url that ajax uses cannot be changed ?
[08:39:59] <anoob> updated: http://pastebin.com/8ebb067C
[08:40:00] <gregf_> *real
[08:40:09] <shoky> meaning?
[08:40:11] <shoky> changed when?
[08:40:36] <gregf_> i make the initial request on page load: http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A123456
[08:40:50] <gregf_> it fails and does a retry on account of the settimeout
[08:40:51] <raj> gregf_, the request has to originate from the same domain I think
[08:40:53] <raj> something like that
[08:41:02] <raj> and it's originating from jsfiddle
[08:41:03] <gregf_> heh, its the same domain :)
[08:41:14] <raj> oh, you mean in your live code
[08:41:20] <shoky> gregf_: if you want to try a differnt url then call $.ajax with a different url
[08:41:27] <gregf_> http://192.168.138.200:3000 is my server, its a json response, not a jsonp :/
[08:42:06] <gregf_> shoky: if you see, i'm calling setTimeout(fetch_price_config_data, 5000)
[08:42:47] <gregf_> its the same function i am calling, but on the url to http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A12345; <== the 6 is missing
[08:42:59] <shoky> huh?
[08:43:22] <shoky> right.. there's no 6 there. so?
[08:43:25] <gregf_> i change the html code on the server to http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A12345
[08:43:33] <shoky> on the server?
[08:43:41] <gregf_> yep
[08:43:46] <shoky> what do you mean..
[08:43:56] <gregf_> i mean the server code
[08:44:06] <shoky> k..
[08:44:23] <gregf_> now, should'nt ajax make a request like so,: http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A12345
[08:44:38] <shoky> yes
[08:44:40] <gregf_> i can see in firebug it still makes the ajax request to : http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A123456
[08:44:53] <gregf_> the url does'nt change despite me changing it on the server
[08:44:56] <shoky> there is no 6 in the fiddle code, so it won't put the 6 there
[08:45:03] <shoky> not in the first time and not other times
[08:45:15] <gregf_> well thats what
[08:45:18] <shoky> why would the url change just because you change something on the server?
[08:45:27] <shoky> ajax doesn't reload the page from the server
[08:45:28] <gregf_> my inital request was http://192.168.138.200:3000/price_config_data?token_id=A12345 <== this is an invalid token
[08:45:33] <shoky> that's the whole point of ajax
[08:45:33] <gregf_> ah man
[08:46:06] <sylflo> hi
[08:46:14] <gregf_> well, that was just for testing so i could see my code coverage is proper :/
[08:46:16] <raj> he lost me
[08:46:27] <gregf_> shoky: thanks much, raj you even
[08:46:39] <raj> sweet, me even
[08:46:41] <shoky> lol
[08:46:53] <raj> shoky, don't know how you follow trains of thought of the likes of us
[08:47:48] <shoky> ;p
[08:48:45] <lianzinho> guy, gotta go, thanks for the help
[08:48:48] <lianzinho> bye
[08:49:31] <raj> if I append an element, data is lost?
[08:49:41] <raj> .data()
[08:50:39] <shoky> no
[08:50:51] <raj> when can I expect data to be lost?
[08:50:54] <raj> cloning only?
[08:50:57] <raj> unless it's deep
[08:51:14] <raj> you know selected options are lost on cloning!
[08:51:19] <raj> that shit pisses me off a lot!
[08:51:23] <shoky> it's always deep. you mean unless it's with "withDataAndEvents"
[08:51:30] <shoky> hehhh
[08:52:04] <shoky> you shouldn't expect data to be lost
[08:52:16] <shoky> not even when cloning without withDataAndevents
[08:52:19] <raj> withDataAndEvents?
[08:52:24] <shoky> it's not lost.. the original still has the data ;p
[08:52:27] <raj> ok
[08:52:33] <raj> thank you sir
[08:52:38] <shoky> so, data doesn't just "get lost" ;p
[08:52:38] <lianzinho> not if you use it
[08:52:40] <lianzinho> hahahaha
[08:52:47] <shoky> ;]
[08:52:52] <lianzinho> loop to the start
[08:56:19] <raj> will $('.element').data('mypluginItemData') retrieve the data for html attribute `data-myplugin-item-data`?
[08:56:49] <raj> if you know offhand
[08:57:03] <shoky> think so
[08:57:33] <shoky> but that's something to test and not ask ;p
[08:58:31] <gregf_> shoky: once a timeout interval is set should it not be cleared as well?
[09:00:10] <sammich> yeah, data- HTML attributes will be retrieved too
[09:03:19] <raj> shorter way to do `if (callback) callback()` ?
[09:03:30] <raj> or nicer
[09:03:35] <sammich> make sure it's a function first
[09:03:42] <raj> it's an argument
[09:03:52] <raj> oh, in case an incorrect type was passed
[09:03:55] <sammich> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[09:09:53] <shoky> gregf_: it should be cleared if you want to cancel it
[09:25:37] <aditsu> hi, is it possible to set a draggable containment with a different shape, such as a hexagon?
[09:33:37] <aditsu> oh, I guess I can adjust the position in the drag event
[10:11:24] <raj> if I do $('#container').myPlugin(), how can I destroy that?
[10:18:24] <raj> I want to $('#container').destroy()
[10:18:26] <raj> or something
[10:18:32] <raj> I want to $('#container').destroy('myPlugin') maybe
[10:18:42] <raj> I want to $('#container').myPlugin('destroy')
[10:18:47] <raj> something like thta
[10:52:11] <stan_man_can> Hi all, does anyone have any experience with the jquery Datatables plugin?
[10:53:41] <shoky> raj yea i'd go with the last one
[10:57:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> stan_man_can: plugin website?
[10:57:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://datatables.net/
[10:57:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[10:57:43] <stan_man_can> Yup
[10:57:56] <stan_man_can> Rohan_Bhangui: yup
[10:58:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay um no
[10:58:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> but ask
[10:58:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[10:58:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> im curious :P
[10:58:40] <stan_man_can> I'm just a bit stumped as it has some methods to move rows from one table to another,  but when it does it's removing the classes from my elements
[10:58:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[10:58:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> why not read the classes
[10:59:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> and store them in var
[10:59:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> once transfer is done
[10:59:09] <stan_man_can> http://bit.ly/191ZUwx
[10:59:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> add them again
[10:59:21] <stan_man_can> it's possible but I'd rather learn why it's happening opposed to hacking out a fix
[10:59:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[10:59:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[10:59:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> not familiar with this plugin
[10:59:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> so not any help
[11:00:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> but the hack is always open
[11:00:19] <stan_man_can> yeah
[11:00:22] <stan_man_can> thanks anyways
[11:01:13] <basic6_> i have some code in the activate event of a jquery tabstrip. this code is only executed when clicking on a tab, not when the page loads. after moving it to the create event, it wont execute after clicking a tab. is there an event for both, so i dont have duplicate code?
[11:01:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> stan_man_can: check what addElement holds
[11:01:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> like console .log it
[11:01:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> and check if it has that class
[11:01:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: always jsfiddle it or show exmaple
[11:02:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> *example
[11:02:56] <stan_man_can> Rohan_Bhangui: Good call. Interesting result  too, it's an array with all the cows content
[11:03:29] <stan_man_can> Rohan_Bhangui:  so it's not actually copying the row over per say, it's copying the content of the rows columns
[11:03:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: what may also make your lazy load plugin a bit better....is what facebook does.....the older items in your feed dont load until you scroll all the way to the bottom of the intial "page"
[11:04:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> stan_man_can: i suspected so
[11:04:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> must be doing foo.html()
[11:04:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> or something
[11:04:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> stan_man_can: so the hack is the only way to do so
[11:05:08] <stan_man_can> unless I'm using the plugin wrong, i'm going to look into alternate ways todo it and if not i'll go with the hack
[11:05:35] <stan_man_can> the function 'm using is fnGetData/fnAddData, hopefully there's another option
[11:10:02] <ChaZ> Guys, can someone help me? I have 2 checkboxes and one variable. How can I change the variable string, when checkboxes are checked?
[11:12:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> stan_man_can: i would sift through the unminified version of the plugin file and
[11:12:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> take alook at how fnGetData/fnAddData work
[11:13:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> ChaZ: im not sure i understand
[11:13:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> you want to change the string for cehck boxes not radio buttons right?
[11:13:56] <avances123> hello, Im having an unexplicable empty post request with http://jsfiddle.net/jAHHA/1/
[11:14:02] <avances123> this simple code
[11:14:09] <avances123> do you know why?
[11:14:45] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: http://paste.debian.net/51189 both events do the exact same thing, so i'm looking for one single event
[11:15:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: let me get familiarized with jquery ui tab
[11:15:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> *tabs
[11:16:10] <avances123> in fact, this doesnt work, it creates a request with all the fields, but all null
[11:16:13] <avances123> $.post('',{ 'items1[]' : [12,13] , 'items2[]' : [67,68] , 'money1' : 12 ,'money2' : 14});
[11:16:21] <avances123> what im doint wrong?
[11:16:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> avances123: you havent specified where the data is posting too
[11:16:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: you said both events do the same action
[11:17:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> what is the behaviour you wnat
[11:17:43] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: whenever a tab is loaded, the code "load tab x" should be executed (tabs contents are loaded)
[11:17:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: have you looked into an .click event
[11:18:28] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: heres the problem - the activate event fires whenever a tab is clicked. but not when the page is loaded. so page is loaded, first tab is selected but no contents
[11:18:41] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: i could just call my activate(currenttab) event in the create but i can't find how to activate a tab
[11:18:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[11:18:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh okay
[11:19:00] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: you know what i mean? not sure i'm clear
[11:19:00] <avances123> Rohan_Bhangui: is the same url, my request url is ok
[11:19:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: i was thinking the on load was fine and the on click was having trouble i have it other way around
[11:19:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> avances123: still specify the file
[11:19:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> if your js file is linked to index.php
[11:20:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> specify index.php
[11:20:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: thinking
[11:20:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-load
[11:20:36] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: both (onload "create" and onclick "activate") work, but i can't find one event that is triggered whenever a tab is loaded
[11:20:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^^see above
[11:21:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> the api has a bunch of laod options
[11:21:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> well load methods and events
[11:22:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: also consider binding an event using .on
[11:22:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> avances123: got it?
[11:23:17] <FuryFoo> I'm trying to get a sound to play on AJAX success but so far autoplay doesn't trigger and FireBug gives me this "All candidate resources failed to load. Media load paused."
[11:23:17] <FuryFoo> Any ideas on how to fix this ? Here's the code : http://pastebin.com/mFWGVjGu
[11:24:44] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: then i'm too dumb to use them. calling $( "#tabs" ).tabs("load", 1) like the docs suggest does nothing. (replacing 1 with 2 also does nothing)
[11:25:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you shuld consider using somethig like this
[11:25:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> $( ".selector" ).on( "tabsactivate", function( event, ui ) {} );
[11:25:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> that may be better
[11:25:43] <avances123> Rohan_Bhangui: you are wrong, its beginner thing that you told me, im investingating
[11:25:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[11:26:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> ive always done it that way just to be on the safe side
[11:26:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> avances123: the api doc says to specify a url in all exmaples http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[11:27:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> avances123: let me know what you find
[11:27:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: see my comments above in case you havent
[11:29:51] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: the on tabsactivate works just like the activate event i'm using. meaning its triggered on click, but not on load
[11:30:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ??
[11:30:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> which are you trying to fix on load or on click
[11:32:00] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: again, both onload (create event) and onclick (activate event) already work. the whole point is that i need an event which is called whenever a tab is loaded. because activate only fires when a tab is loaded by clicking. create only fires when a tab is activated automatically onload.
[11:32:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> basic6_: you look into before load?
[11:32:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> evnet
[11:32:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> *event
[11:33:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> try the other event
[11:33:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> events
[11:34:00] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: yes, beforeLoad doesnt seem to fire at all. like ever.
[11:34:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:34:14] <basic6_> anyone here who has used the jquery ui tabstrip widget and tried to do something on activate?
[11:34:28] * Rohan_Bhangui feels useless
[11:36:46] <basic6_> Rohan_Bhangui: sorry, i appreciate your help. but it looks like isomeone opened a bug for this issue and although i havent read it all, it looks like the author doesn't think such an event fits in his design
[11:37:37] <basic6_> oh i'm just gonna hack around this stuff
[11:38:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:38:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> when in doubt hack it
[11:38:41] <mdev> $('classname').prop('checked', false);
[11:38:53] <mdev> not working, no error given, does this work on classes?
[11:39:22] <raj> is this not supposed to work? `function parent() { var test='test'; $('#btn').on('click', function(ev) { console.log(test)  })`
[11:39:37] <raj> it doesn't have access to the parent function's variables?
[11:40:44] <avances123> hello, when I post array data, jquery serializes like variable[]=x1,variable[]=x2...
[11:41:05] <avances123> how can I delete this convention in jquery, and remove brackets of the keys in the request?
[11:41:49] <avances123> I mean the behaviour as jquery // <=1.3.2:
[11:43:51] <Tingle> Im trying to decide/learn how to write my html pages with ids classes etc for selector performance. CSS tells us to use classes over IDs and then tags etc for performance and maintainability. jquery on the other hand says use IDs over Tags and avoid class selectors. this makes me think that it would be best to write the html selectors in the css way to do it, and then give elements that you want to interact with
[11:43:51] <Tingle>  id's specificly for jquery to use. Is this recommended or is there a better way to go about it? for example if I had <body><section> and I want to style and control section, the way to go would be giving section both a class and id. or maybe do body > section in css and give section an id?
[11:44:26] <Tingle> but then again class selector would be faster than child selector in css
[11:44:38] <mdev> so no one is a jquery expert in here
[11:44:51] <mdev> guess i'll keep googling
[11:49:16] <Tingle> anyone?
[11:50:22] <sonotos> Tingle: depends what you need too do. if possible use ids. if you want to target a group of elements flag them with classes
[11:50:26] <mdev> 805 people
[11:50:33] <mdev> that's a lot of people :)
[11:51:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> avances123: cant you convert to string and then do a replace all?
[11:52:35] <Tingle> sonotos: Ive been reading alot about using classes over ids for css.
[11:52:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev: use a .change event
[11:52:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then do your .prop thing
[11:53:34] <sonotos> Tingle: diffrent usecase
[11:53:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: here is how I decide... if something is a general case use a class.....if its a specific case use an id
[11:54:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> Tingle: exmaple -> if you have a blog each blog post should have the same class
[11:54:09] <sonotos> in jquery you want to target a specific node. in case of a widget #calendar-42
[11:54:30] <sonotos> however you would hat have all .calendar s the same style
[11:54:44] <mdev> rhona you mean listen for changes regarding that class?
[11:54:52] <Tingle> mm ok
[11:54:53] <Tingle> thanks
[11:55:06] <mdev> I want to be able to check/uncheck a checkbox at will not based off an event
[11:55:37] <sonotos> i mean you "want that"
[11:57:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev: if you look at the .prop documentation thats what they do
[11:57:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev: on change jsut detects the change
[11:59:26] <mdev> i'll google thanks
[11:59:37] <mdev> as I don't get what you're saying :)
[12:02:00] <sonotos> mdev: looks like you forgot a dot
[12:03:59] <mdev> my code has it, I was just rushing to ask in here so didn't write it above
[12:11:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> well think about it
[12:11:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev
[12:11:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> you want to get the prop
[12:11:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> of a selector
[12:11:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is specified by class
[12:11:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what ebtter way than to do a .change event
[12:12:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev: let me jsfiddle for you
[12:14:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/FmDzd/
[12:14:26] <shoky> raj: that should work fine
[12:15:45] <mdev> herm
[12:15:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev: wut?
[12:16:27] <mdev> well what i'm trying to do is basically call marktheseboxes() anywhere in my code and have it checkmark all the checkmarks
[12:17:04] <mdev> your example I really don't get, why would I need to set the checkbox on a change event, wouldn't it already be set? this ofcouse isn't what i'm after just confused at your code
[12:17:11] <mdev> for what use case that would apply to
[12:17:29] <mdev> oh nevermind it simply detects the check, ahh ok
[12:18:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> yh
[12:19:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> im a bit confused by your question
[12:21:14] <mdev> I just want to uncheck all checkboxs that have the same class
[12:23:30] <jphase> mdev: try $('.myclass').removeAttr('checked')
[12:25:18] <mdev> didn't work
[12:25:34] <mdev> but it's ok i'll just loop through each I guess and figure it out
[12:25:46] <mdev> I really don't want to click to uncheck though as that fires off fading stuff
[12:29:41] <jphase> mdev: hmm, that really should work :[    http://jsfiddle.net/3Ppqq/
[12:33:14] <mdev> yeah idk why isn't working for me maybe other issue in my code
[12:33:25] <mdev> i'll play around with it somemore, thanks
[12:37:16] <jphase> mdev: np, if you want help and have a public link I can see or can make a fiddle of it or something, I'm glad to help troubleshoot
[12:42:48] <malibu> Hi there... I'm asking in the jquery page because I am using jquery... Is there a good base css file that people use?
[12:44:44] <mdev> thanks jphase and malibu what do you mean by base css file
[12:45:56] <mdev> in terms of frameworks, twitter bootstrap is a nice one, has nice jquery plugins and good css classes, for auto sizing for device http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
[12:45:57] <malibu> Welll a lot of people start with * {padding:0;margin:0;}
[12:45:58] <mdev> that sort of thing
[12:46:42] <malibu> over the years there have been several 'must have definitions'
[12:48:32] <mdev> #css would probably be more helpful, what i tend to do is if i visit a site that does something neat, I use google chromes inspect to take a look at the css and maybe javascript
[12:48:33] <mdev> :D
[12:50:59] <Wolf_22> Do you have to bind events just to check if a checkbox is checked?
[12:51:08] <malibu> mdev: is that like firebug?
[12:52:21] <tw2113> yes
[12:52:31] <mdev> yeah, I believe it may even be based of it, but IMHO it's WAY better/easier, firefox infact, newer versions I find myself annoyed trying to use their inspect or even 3rd party firebug these days
[12:52:52] <mdev> so I don't bother, chrome's is really nice
[12:53:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> Wolf_22: dont think so
[12:53:54] * tw2113 prefers firefox's native inspect tools these days
[12:53:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can use a .change event (but i guess thats the sort of thing you want to avoid)
[12:55:41] <Wolf_22> Rohan_Bhangui: Okay, then how can someone do something if it's checked or not--and not just once after the page loads?
[12:55:43] <mdev> google turned up $('#' + id).is(":checked") to determine it
[12:56:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> here is how i would do it
[12:56:03] <mdev> so $('#divname').is(":checked")
[12:56:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/FmDzd/
[12:56:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> or what mdev used
[12:56:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> mdev++;
[12:56:28] <Wolf_22> Gotchya. Thanks guys.
[12:56:38] <mdev> stakeoverflow++ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2204250/check-if-checkbox-is-checked-with-jquery
[12:56:38] <mdev> :D
[13:03:26] <malibu> mdev: I honestly worry about google stealing ideas if I use chrome though
[13:39:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: didnt they recently aquire flutter?
[13:48:19] <shwaiil> Q: shouldn't triggering $('foo').trigger("mouseover"); do the same behaviour as with actually :hover with the mouse ?!?

[14:42:46] <MaddinXx> hi there. anyone an idea how to use delay() with css() ? here's the code: http://pastebin.com/0DsN0KAd
[14:50:40] <NiB> hey. Little question. let's say i doo something like $('.myclass').fadeIn(); how can i fire a complete function only once (and not one time for each .myclass) ?
[14:54:17] <Tomashe> hey guys , anyone have a clue why my website works so slow on iphone : www.perfects.co.il , when u click on the orange button for instance

[14:58:18] <Tomashe> ohh ok that
[14:58:37] <Tomashe> this is not really a big animation
[14:58:45] <Tomashe> is that what makes my website STUCK

[14:58:52] <Tomashe> yes
[14:58:56] <shoky> that's what i've heard
[14:59:09] <shoky> css animations are a must for mobile site performance
[14:59:10] <Tomashe> hmm
[14:59:24] <Tomashe> ok lets disable it and seew hat happened
[14:59:26] <shoky> not from experience, just what i've heard
[15:00:46] <doug65536> lol, that dude types in lkjlkjlkjlkj  a lot
[15:01:07] <shoky> lol
[15:01:17] <Tomashe> what?
[15:01:43] <shoky> your flash dude
[15:01:47] <Tomashe> doesnt looks like that what makes the website slow.. i update the script and look..

[15:02:27] <shoky> i dont have ios
[15:02:46] <shoky> the contact dialog doesnt open good on android tho
[15:02:54] <shoky> android chrome, that is
[15:03:11] <Tomashe> yes , im talking about iphone as i specified

[15:03:33] <shoky> not about what you were talking about ;p
[15:04:18] <Tomashe> :)
[15:05:23] <Tomashe> anyone can give a try to help regarding my issue
[15:05:28] <Tomashe> "hey guys , anyone have a clue why my website works so slow on iphone : www.perfects.co.il , when u click on the orange button for instance"
[15:05:40] <NiB> first cut that terrible music
[15:05:58] <NiB> allow right click
[15:07:53] <Tomashe> i removed the music from iphone
[15:09:47] <NiB> it's not specially slow on my iphone
[15:13:16] <Tomashe> click on orange button
[15:13:23] <Tomashe> it takes some time for it to response
[15:17:44] <doug65536> Tomashe: all you do is $(".ticket").css("display","block"); ?
[15:18:03] <NiB> ye and that javascript void...
[15:18:05] <doug65536> Tomashe: does the performance problem still happen?
[15:18:37] <NiB> you could remove that js and use event.preventDefault();
[15:19:34] <NiB> i don't think it's the issue, but that inline javascript is disturbing :)
[15:20:02] <doug65536> 1994 called, they want their javascript: protocol back
[15:20:38] <NiB> hehe

[16:59:16] <foo> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/y5Ljj/ - hmm

[17:20:53] <raj> can I have query parameters in my POST?
[17:21:44] <jphase> ChaZ: are your headers from your server-side script set to application/json ?
[17:22:07] <ChaZ> yeap
[17:22:35] <ChaZ> it works when i set the urlSource as simple URL
[17:23:16] <ChaZ> I think it has to do with those checkbox conditions on line 5
[17:23:27] <ChaZ> probably a syntax error
[17:23:32] <torbjorn> is any event fired when i run thruogh select options with the keyboard?
[17:24:09] <torbjorn> ie first I click it to bring up the options list, then arrow down/up to click through them, can I catch those keyboard events?
[17:25:02] <jphase> ChaZ: do you see the JSON coming back in your network tab correctly? Is the URL okay that it's getting JSON data from?
[17:25:33] <raj> can I have query parameters in my POST? I'm not understanding from this POST whether it's ok or not --> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/611906/http-post-with-url-query-parameters-good-idea-or-not
[17:25:44] <jphase> raj: I think you can but they'd be accessible via GET rather than POST.
[17:26:40] <raj> jphase, yes, I'm aware of that
[17:26:45] <raj> but is it kosher to do?
[17:26:48] <raj> or sloppy?
[17:26:58] <raj> and does it defy any standards?
[17:27:20] <jphase> oh, I just pass all my stuff in a post var if I need stuff sent, mixing methods is not the best practice I wouldn't think no
[17:30:20] <dinho> it is possible to send the current page by email?
[17:53:39] <ChaZ> jphase that is the thing: i try to build the URL dinamically, by using checkboxes. It's there in the code, i just can.t solve it.
[17:59:50] <jphase> ChaZ: yeah I see that the URL changes according to those checks, have you opened up your network tab in dev tools to confirm that the URL it's posting to is correct based on those is(':checked') checks?
[18:00:53] <ChaZ> this is a problem. I develop an app for Android. Is there a way I can see this in Eclipse?
[18:02:48] <ChaZ> http://jsfiddle.net/dmbostan/eFDjZ/4/ shows that the URL are formed correctly
[18:03:53] <ChaZ> but when combining the code with the getjson function, the retrieveng isnot working
[18:04:22] <ChaZ> I think the data data from checkboxes can't get to the region variable
[18:04:53] <ChaZ> this way crashing the retreving
[18:13:14] <shoky> ChaZ: why are you doing $(".retrievejson").click(retriever);
[18:13:37] <shoky> that calls the whole doc-ready function all over again
[18:13:57] <shoky> including adding click-handlers
[18:14:38] <ChaZ> shoky I shall remove it
[18:14:58] <shoky> ChaZ: also, in the line:  var urlSource = "http://www.privesc.eu/home/ios?categories%3DToate&regiunea=" + region;
[18:15:08] <shoky> region is not defined in that scope
[18:17:17] <ChaZ> i thought so. and how can I make that the region could get the value from the checkboxes?
[18:17:53] <shoky> your logic for the checboxes setting the 'region' var seems kinda off
[18:18:07] <shoky> you want it to add 1 each time some checkbox is checked?
[18:18:19] <shoky> so if i check that same checkbox 100 times, region will be 50 ?
[18:19:58] <shoky> but anyway you want something more like this.. i guess: http://jsfiddle.net/FqL5V/1/
[18:20:18] <ChaZ> User shall check the desired options > click .retrievejson > getjson with desired settings
[18:20:35] <shoky> yes but what is the logic for setting the region ..
[18:20:43] <shoky> oh
[18:20:55] <shoky> er well yea my fiddle does that.
[18:24:05] <shoky> o just saw your 2nd fiddle
[18:25:30] <shoky> ChaZ: so you want this - http://jsfiddle.net/FqL5V/2/
[18:29:29] <ChaZ> shoky, let me check that. One sec pls
[18:34:24] <ChaZ> this is wierd. if i remove the $("input.checkbox").click(function (), rwgion ia 0 and is ok. with comments, the data is not diplayed.
[18:34:46] <ChaZ> *regions is
[18:36:01] <ChaZ> one sec
[19:15:48] <unnu> quick question
[19:16:13] <unnu> if i wanna make a div element and append it to a div with an ID
[19:16:35] <unnu> do i make it as a var and .appendTo?
[19:19:37] <unnu> i can't seem to get it working
[19:19:38] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/zguL7/
[19:26:17] <jphase> unnu: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/zguL7/3/
[19:29:51] <jphase> alternatively, you could make your own method that extends jQuery so you could chain it from a regular jQuery selector
[19:29:51] <jphase> oh, I suppose #editor in that appendTo should be changed to "editor" from the variable, muh bad
[19:31:34] <unnu> thanks jphase
[19:31:38] <unnu> thats gunna help alot
[19:31:49] <unnu> now i gotta add buttons and functions and such
[19:32:23] <jphase> unnu: np, and I'd normally just use .addClass to that div instead of .prop there but I didn't know if you wanted to add more attributes
[19:32:32] <unnu> yeah
[19:33:17] <unnu> hey jphase
[19:33:21] <jphase> sup?
[19:33:32] <unnu> how do you feel about the data-tag attribute?
[19:33:42] <unnu> can i PM?
[19:33:48] <jphase> when used well I think it's quite efficient
[19:33:51] <jphase> sure
[20:15:26] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/mDK2M/5/ -- once clicking "GO TO PACKERY PAGE" -- is there a way to prevent the scrollbar from appearing under the purple jQuery Mobile header -- while at the same time keeping overflow: auto on #packery_page.ui-page? The latter prevents half the page from losing its black background.
[20:20:58] <the-erm> Is there  away to get the element that was just appended?  var appendedDiv = $("#id").append("<div></div>"); doesn't do it.
[20:30:41] <the-erm> never mind I figured it out I was adding a row to a table a. var t = $("<table></table>"); t.append("<tr><td></td></tr>"); var tr = t.find("tr");  tableWantItOn.append(tr); // it's a hack, but it works.
[20:31:48] <boytoy> the-erm: $("<table />"); is a little bit sexier if u ask me :p
[20:34:21] <the-erm> I'm still trying to figure out if backbone is worth it.
[20:35:38] <the-erm> In some ways it's really nice, but it seems to add a lot more work.
[20:35:59] <boytoy> the-erm: isnt it like a giant patch to cover over for the lack of a proper server-side framework?
[20:36:00] <the-erm> I suppose it's more maintainable.
[20:36:04] <boytoy> like rails or whatever
[20:36:11] <boytoy> idk though i just discovered backbone a couple of days ago
[20:37:33] <the-erm> We've been using it on one of our projects.  It took some time to get used to.
[20:38:12] <the-erm> I like underscore js though.  The templates in that are usefull.
[20:38:15] <boytoy> the-erm: how is it like vs jquery mobile?
[20:38:28] <boytoy> cool i gotta google that one
[20:39:16] <the-erm> Jquery mobile is more like a jquery ui.  backbone.js is like an mvc framweork.
[20:39:38] <boytoy> ah yeah, that makes sense
[20:40:28] <the-erm> backbone.js requires underscore js.
[20:42:23] <the-erm> It's funny you mention jquery mobile.  I've been fighting with a slider all day.
[20:43:45] <LLckfan> I have a Gateway laptop and when I opened the lid the power light was on but the laptop was asleep. When I pushed the power it started flashing with the lights for the light bulb and the battery but only when it was plugged in. Is this a sign I need a new tip end for my charger?
[20:45:20] <the-erm>  LLckfan I don't knw.
[20:46:00] <the-erm> I used to live in chat rooms ... something happened.
[21:09:32] <boytoy> the-erm: u got rich?
[21:12:05] <boytoy> the-erm: most cats are here looking for wealth and prosperity. if they stop hanging around it either means they made it or they gave up, so which one is u?
[21:12:54] <the-erm> I like to hack.
[21:18:03] <Hodds_> hey guys, just wondering if there was a way to make this run an unlimited amount of times, rather then once. http://pastebin.com/wem1JuKM
[21:18:54] <Hodds_> I wonder if a while statement used in this would work?  or would it chew up all the processor usage on the client computer?
[21:27:45] <the-erm> You can use a while, but I don't recommend it.
[21:28:15] <the-erm> and yes, you will use up all the cpu.
[21:28:36] <Hodds_> thanks, thats what I thought.
[21:28:57] <Hodds_> is there a way that would not use up all the clients processing power?
[21:29:29] <the-erm> What you could do is setInterval(function(){},1000); and have it execute once every second,
[21:29:46] <the-erm> let me look at your code a little closer.
[21:30:44] <the-erm> What exactly do you want to run over & over?
[21:30:54] <the-erm> The shout?
[21:32:03] <Hodds_> yeah when they submit it the code in $original_output comes back updated with the new shout.
[21:33:15] <Hodds_> $original_output contains a html form code.
[21:34:05] <Hodds_> the 1st submit works fine, but the second submit goes to the forms action location
[21:36:43] <the-erm> ok
[21:37:18] <the-erm> For starters, you probably have 2 #shout divs.
[21:37:53] <the-erm> Or the old one is being overwritten.
[21:38:07] <the-erm> give me a second.  I'll edit this.
[21:38:33] <Hodds_> ok thanks, I think this is overwritting the #shout div
[21:41:20] <the-erm> Hodds_: http://pastebin.com/1VRt6iK9
[21:41:24] <the-erm> that will probably work.
[21:43:06] <the-erm> Hang on I'm tired ...
[21:43:15] <Hodds_> ok,
[21:43:46] <the-erm> Nope that'll work.
[21:43:53] <the-erm> Thought I forgot to re-bind.
[21:44:14] <the-erm> I don't know how "right" of an answer that is, but it'll work.
[21:45:00] <Hodds_> yeah cool cool... I'll give it a go.
[21:45:55] <the-erm> I think there might be a better way to do it.  For instance, you could have ../jquery/shout.php return json, and just update the val()
[21:47:15] <Hodds_> yeah I thought about that, but this is the easier way, as it returns a table with 5 shouts in it.
[21:47:20] <the-erm> I think by default jquery will send the a header indicating that it's a xmlhttprequest, and php can read the header, send json if it's xmlhttp and send the web page other wise.
[21:47:56] <Hodds_> yeah I use xml with another one somewhere else.
[21:48:21] <Hodds_> thanks heaps, that code did exactly what I was after.
[21:48:38] <the-erm> I accept bitcoin :)
[21:50:01] <boytoy> :P
[21:51:03] <boytoy> im sure theres a lotta nice app ideas for bitcoins that nobody's thought of yet
[21:51:51] <the-erm> I don't know if it's going to go anywhere, but it sure is an interesting concept.
[21:54:21] <the-erm> If it does.  I'll be worth ... well enough to pay off the house.
[21:54:21] <boytoy> yep
[21:54:21] <boytoy> hehe
[21:59:32] <the-erm> If all bitcoins are made, and they end up being valued at 1:1 ratio of what all the gold in the world is worth.  1 coin will be worth at least 100,000 USD.
[21:59:39] <adposition75> 1
[21:59:56] <the-erm> ... is that a warning?
[22:00:04] <adposition75> 1
[22:00:20] <the-erm> does it go up or down?
[22:00:27] <adposition75> 1
[22:00:31] <the-erm> 2
[22:00:38] <adposition75> 1
[22:07:05] <boytoy> lol

[22:07:37] <boytoy> druggie
[22:07:45] <adposition75> 1
[22:49:33] <jcrawford> hey guys I have a really long form page that has multiple textarea's for notes for records.  All records are in a single form and when posted there could be 50 note text areas that are getting posted.  Would it be a bad idea to use jquery to monitor these notes text area's for changes and on click of the submit button remove any textarea elements which have not changed state?  I don't like the idea of posting 50 elements and t
[22:49:41] <adposition75> 1
[22:49:53] <jcrawford> I cannot just ignore empty textareas because someone could have deleted the notes in the textarea meaning the database would require updating
[22:50:03] <jcrawford> I know the UI sucks but I am locked into it by my boss
[22:50:15] <adposition75> 1
[22:50:15] <adposition75> 1
[22:53:16] <the-erm> jcrawford: sounds to me like you need a click to edit note solution.
[22:53:23] <adposition75> 1
[22:53:32] <the-erm> then once it's edited PUT, or POST the data via ajax.
[22:53:39] <adposition75> 1
[22:53:53] <jcrawford> the-erm: this is a mult-page form i am editing, can't just inject ajax like that
[22:54:03] <adposition75> 1
[22:54:21] <jcrawford> he wont allow for UI changes, though I guess I could have the page loaded and use spans for the notes and on click have it change to a textarea which will get posted via the form
[22:54:29] <adposition75> 1
[22:55:12] <the-erm> so you're posting a bunch of notes[] ?
[22:55:19] <adposition75> 1
[22:55:24] <the-erm> If that makes any sense.
[22:55:31] <adposition75> 1
[22:55:39] <jcrawford> or just disabled
[22:55:48] <adposition75> 1
[22:55:49] <the-erm> adposition75: please stop it's not funny anymore.
[22:55:56] <adposition75> the-erm: 1
[22:56:24] <jcrawford> well kinda, the page lists out journals and then papers, papers contain the notes so there could be 50 journals all listing 30 papers which means 1500 notes being posted, could lead to too much data being posted as well
[22:56:28] <the-erm> I guess what I'm asking do you have <textarea name="note[]"></textarea>
[22:56:36] <jcrawford> kinda it's more like this
[22:56:45] <adposition75> 1
[22:56:45] <adposition75> 1
[22:56:45] <adposition75> 1
[22:56:59] <jcrawford> <textarea cols='20' rows='3' name='data[$journal_abbrev][{$paper_id}][notes]'>{$paper->license_reminder_notes}</textarea>
[22:57:06] <adposition75> 1
[22:57:22] <the-erm> You just solved your problem :)
[22:57:29] <adposition75> 1
[22:58:32] <the-erm> <textarea data-journal_abbrev="<?php echo $journal_abbrev; ?>" data-paper_id="<?php echo $paper_id;">
[22:58:39] <adposition75> 1
[22:59:03] <the-erm> Then access those via $("textareaID").data("abbrev");
[22:59:10] <adposition75> 1
[22:59:27] <the-erm> hang on a second I'll write something up really quick to show you.
[22:59:34] <jcrawford> appreciate it
[22:59:34] <adposition75> 1
[22:59:42] <adposition75> 1
[22:59:51] <jcrawford> adposition75: i think you are just trying to be annoying now, ignoring you,
[23:00:00] <adposition75> jcrawford: 1
[23:00:22] <jcrawford> so glad for irc clients allowing an ignore list
[23:00:28] <adposition75> 1

[23:01:22] <adposition75> 1
[23:01:28] <jcrawford> i just added him to ignore so i didn't have to see all the garbage
[23:01:36] <adposition75> 1
[23:01:51] <aro> ugh
[23:01:59] <adposition75> 1
[23:02:01] <aro> trolls
[23:02:05] <jcrawford> yep

[23:02:16] <adposition75> 1
[23:02:25] <jcrawford> im guessing there are no staff members around or he would have been ejected by now
[23:02:32] <adposition75> 1
[23:02:35] <aro> probably not
[23:02:39] <aro> most people sleep at this hour ;)
[23:02:46] <aro> *most people*
[23:02:51] <jcrawford> yea i am not like most unfortunately hah

[23:17:40] <adposition75> 1
[23:17:50] <the-erm> Quick & dirty, but I think something like that would work.
[23:17:57] <adposition75> 1
[23:18:16] <jcrawford> taking a look moment
[23:18:24] <adposition75> 1
[23:18:28] <the-erm> All you would have to do is loop through your existing notes object, and update.
[23:18:36] <adposition75> 1
[23:18:40] <the-erm> or create.
[23:18:47] <adposition75> 1
[23:18:49] <jcrawford> the-erm: you missed the part where i can't change the ui, i cannot add ajax
[23:18:51] <Mrgoose2> sup guys
[23:18:53] <jcrawford> i think i found a solution though

[23:19:54] <jcrawford> fat: they cannot both have the same id
[23:20:01] <adposition75> 1
[23:20:02] <jcrawford> id's are unique one per page
[23:20:09] <adposition75> 1

[23:21:22] <jcrawford> funhouse: let me guess your talking about the guy posting nothing but 1's
[23:21:28] <jcrawford> i added him to ignore long ago lol
[23:21:29] <funhouse> jcrawford: yup.
[23:21:42] <jcrawford> he thinks it's some kind of game or something, or maybe it's the only key on his keyboard that works :D
