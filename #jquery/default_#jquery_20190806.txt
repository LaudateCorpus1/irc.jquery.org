[11:23:14] <tona> hello everyone good day :)
[11:23:52] <tona> what I am missing here, if I copy and paste the url on my browse , I am getting my webservice but not under javascript , jQuery.ajax({
[11:23:54] <tona> );
[11:23:59] <tona> could someone advice me please :)
[11:44:48] <makr8100> tona: make a fiddle or paste so we can see
[11:45:01] <tona>  https://pastebin.com/TDhGuj2w
[11:45:03] <makr8100> in your short paste here you're missing a closing } bracket
[11:45:26] <makr8100> ah, it's a few issues
[11:45:45] <makr8100> type: 'json', method: 'GET'
[11:46:08] <makr8100> you won't need to use JSON.parse(data) as data will already be parsed into a js object/array by JQuery
[11:47:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5sq2bj63/
[11:47:17] <robertmaxrees> and don'e use success: - use .then() instead :)
[11:47:41] <makr8100> actually it's dataType, not type
[11:47:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't need either.
[11:47:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:49:57] <makr8100> right, dataType uses "best guess" by default, and if you specify and it comes back in an incorrect format you can handle it in the .fail()
[11:50:08] <makr8100> iirc method: 'GET' is default
[11:50:12] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[11:50:24] <robertmaxrees> and you want to use .catch() instead of .fail() these days :)
[11:50:33] <makr8100> well I'm behind the times :/
[11:50:54] <robertmaxrees> promises, yo :)
[11:51:13] <makr8100> stop chaning syntax >.<  lol
[11:51:23] <robertmaxrees> you actually want to chain with promises.
[11:52:04] <robertmaxrees> then().catch() <- this will handle cases where your .then() handler throws an error.  .then(function, function) won't
[11:52:34] <makr8100> well now I gotta go thru all my .done().fail() stuff...  thanks :P
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:28:45] <tona> robertmaxrees, one question I am trying to put one input text box and use Jquery.On(input) in and after this even to read my webservice and retrieve the information, it works fine using it slowely but if I typed is fast nor return me the result expected , I am wondering if you could advice me some people told me to use bounce , I am trying to find
[12:28:45] <tona> something in google for it but not luck
[12:29:11] <robertmaxrees> *debounce
[12:29:13] <robertmaxrees> or throttle.
[12:29:45] <tona> yes, is there one way to handle it using the fiddle your shared with me
[12:29:57] <robertmaxrees> use a debounce lol
[12:30:05] <robertmaxrees> https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[12:30:37] <tona> this is used before or after my function
[12:31:54] <robertmaxrees> did you even read the page?
[12:32:08] <tona> reading now :)
[12:53:34] <MikeD_> i think the history/backstory for "debounce" is interesting
[12:53:42] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[12:55:02] <MikeD_> https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/switch-bounce-how-to-deal-with-it/
[12:55:49] <robertmaxrees> interesting
[12:55:56] <MikeD_> right?  :)
[12:57:03] <MikeD_> and visualizing a large door being thrown shut the catch might have some room to move and the force of the door also would "bounce" and wiggle a little until the door motion settles
[17:54:39] <Nyle> Hello. I have the following code bit: https://jsfiddle.net/3h62ckyf/
[17:55:03] <Nyle> The trouble is that my logic seems sound to me, but .each is targeting only 'amount' and not chargebackamount,writeoffamount
[17:55:35] <Nyle> So, when amount which should be in 'v' changes, run the function
[17:55:49] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:55:55] <Nyle> .change function here only fires for 'amount'. Not sure why
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> so that's not how you combine jquery objects :)
[17:56:05] <Nyle> oh?
[17:56:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:56:14] <Nyle> I keep getting a NaN in my final balance
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> add some markup.
[17:56:16] <Nyle> hehe
[17:56:34] <Nyle> I've on this for a while now :)
[17:56:50] <robertmaxrees> add some markup to the fiddle and i can show you what's up.
[17:56:54] <Nyle> So what must I do? What kind of markup. oh
[17:56:59] <Nyle> I see hang on maybe
[17:58:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e8qp7dkj/1/
[17:58:41] <Nyle> sec
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> see how you just get 1 in the console?
[18:01:01] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:02:08] <Nyle> Not really
[18:02:16] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "not really"?
[18:02:21] <robertmaxrees> what do you see in the console?
[18:04:34] <robertmaxrees> Nyle ^
[18:05:50] <Nyle> https://jsfiddle.net/3h62ckyf/1/ I did this instead, now it targets the .change event on every required input, but when the result adjusted_balance is calculated, I get NaN
[18:06:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad way to do that still.
[18:06:06] <Nyle> Oh?
[18:06:08] <Nyle> :(
[18:06:09] <robertmaxrees> slow down
[18:06:11] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[18:06:12] <Nyle> Yes sir
[18:06:19] <Nyle> I will eat a skittle.
[18:06:37] <robertmaxrees> why not just add a class you all of those and select on that class?
[18:07:19] <Nyle> Hmm
[18:07:41] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with the rownum business?
[18:07:43] <Nyle> I was trying to not do that and keep it in js
[18:08:04] <robertmaxrees> mind filling out the fiddle some more with some example html?
[18:08:12] <robertmaxrees> like you said you'd do originally? ;)
[18:08:16] <Nyle> arbitrary number of rows, each row contains these inputs, if an input changes on that row, do some calc and update the last field
[18:08:24] <robertmaxrees> for that row?
[18:08:30] <Nyle> yes for that row
[18:08:34] <Nyle> that's why the rownum
[18:08:37] <robertmaxrees> you don't need 90% of this logic to do that.
[18:08:43] <robertmaxrees> add some example html and i'll show you.
[18:09:10] <Nyle> https://jsfiddle.net/3h62ckyf/2/
[18:09:19] <Nyle> I copy pasta from the html, was easiest
[18:09:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't need most of this.
[18:10:01] <Nyle> What dost thou suggesteth?
[18:10:39] <robertmaxrees> use a class on the inputs, select that, bind a change handler, then use simple DOM traversal from ther.e
[18:11:04] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to use things like invalid custom attributes
[18:11:32] <robertmaxrees> also: .val() returns strings, not numbers.
[18:11:44] <Nyle> Hm.
[18:11:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to parseInt or parseFloat on those .val()s to get numbers.
[18:11:55] <Nyle> I see
[18:12:09] <robertmaxrees> hence your NaN
[18:12:16] <robertmaxrees> how many rows are you dealing with here?
[18:12:48] <Nyle> arbitrary, in this case, over 250
[18:13:01] <Nyle> for some orders i tcould be more or less
[18:13:03] <robertmaxrees> i might consider doing delegated handlers on each tr then.
[18:13:14] <robertmaxrees> for memory reasons.
[18:15:01] <robertmaxrees> but the issue with your first fiddle was that you were basically doing $($('foo'), $('bar'), $('baz')) - that ignores the third argument and is looking for $('foo') in $('bar'), which doesn't make any sense.
[18:15:37] <robertmaxrees> if you're going to have multiple selections like that in one object, you need to either do $('foo, bar, baz'), or $('foo').add($('bar')).add($('baz'));
