[04:37:09] <pasteko> Hello, I've successfuly added content to a table using .append, now I need to access the added content to change the text inside the <td> how can I do that ?
[04:40:55] <slax0r> how did you add? can you make a fiddle?
[04:41:06] <henk_> Since DOM is already rendered, your script won't know there is a new td
[04:41:10] <henk_> you need to have a listener
[04:41:59] <slax0r> if it's just to attach some event handler, like click on all tds, you can do $('table').on('click', 'td', function() {});
[04:42:16] <slax0r> this will delegate the attaching of the handler
[04:42:24] <slax0r> and will wirk on all new dynamically created TDs
[04:43:23] <slax0r> if you want to access that td specifically to add more stuff to it, then you can maybe access it already before you've even appended it to the table, or use a proper selector
[05:19:20] <DreamyStiffy> hi
[05:19:52] <DreamyStiffy> Cork: yo sifoo you around. simple question. http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjson_objectarray_3 how do i display all of them?
[05:20:34] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: really, REALLY don't use w3schools.com
[05:20:40] <Cork> it is a BAD source of information
[05:20:52] <DreamyStiffy> its easy for me to learn.
[05:21:03] <Cork> except you learn the wrong things
[05:21:09] <DreamyStiffy> ahuh
[05:21:19] <Cork> you learn bad practices
[05:21:22] <DreamyStiffy> so....
[05:21:26] <DreamyStiffy> okay
[05:21:31] <Cork> and you learn things that are not cross browser
[05:21:55] <DreamyStiffy> okay
[05:22:02] <DreamyStiffy> what do you suggest then
[05:22:23] <DreamyStiffy> i tried jquery but seems a bit too in depth...good info but i tend to get lost there
[05:22:27] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn is a good alternative
[05:22:27] <DreamyStiffy> or mozilla
[05:22:32] <DreamyStiffy> ok
[05:22:36] <DreamyStiffy> ill try that
[05:22:57] <Cork> http://learn.jquery.com/ is another
[05:23:09] <DreamyStiffy> exactly went both before
[05:23:12] <DreamyStiffy> but got lost
[05:23:17] <DreamyStiffy> but ill try again
[05:23:42] <DreamyStiffy> any chance i can get help on these arrays?
[05:23:48] <DreamyStiffy> do i need to do a for each?
[05:24:24] <Cork> do you want a pure js solution or a jquery one?
[05:24:51] <DreamyStiffy> either ways that i could understand
[05:24:55] <DreamyStiffy> which is easier
[05:25:01] <DreamyStiffy> since im in jquery why not
[05:25:52] <pasteko> Sorry slax0r fiddle was also new to me : https://jsfiddle.net/cjcuan31/
[05:26:27] <FilipNortic__> you could argue that if understanding js is the goa,l jQuery gets somewhat in the way
[05:26:44] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/
[05:27:15] <Cork> $.map loops the array and makes the object the first attribute in (employee)
[05:27:34] <Cork> the returned string then gets collected into a new array
[05:27:50] <Cork> that gets merged into a new string (.join(', '))
[05:28:03] <Cork> and finally set as text in the #demo element
[05:28:42] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: there are other ways you can go at this, for example wrap each employee in an element
[05:28:49] <DreamyStiffy> wow
[05:28:59] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: and then append that employee at the end of the p child list
[05:28:59] <DreamyStiffy> i get this but couldnt think of it
[05:29:24] <FilipNortic__> well you are not alone there
[05:29:56] <DreamyStiffy> if you dont mind can i see the js way of doing what you did?
[05:30:05] <Cork> sure
[05:30:25] <DreamyStiffy> DreamyStiffy: and then append that employee at the end of the p child list <---i think i got this...i just didnt know how to display all of them arrays.
[05:31:54] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/1/
[05:32:30] <Cork> /1/ is actually quite a bit more efficient
[05:32:59] <DreamyStiffy> efficient in which way
[05:33:04] <DreamyStiffy> but this is vanilla js?
[05:33:09] <Cork> yes
[05:33:31] <Cork> it creates quite a few less objects to do the job
[05:33:36] <Cork> normally it doesn't matter though
[05:34:18] <Cork> the readability gain from the jquery example compensates for that in my book (unless you end up with something with a VERY high performance demand)
[05:35:43] <DreamyStiffy> Thanks cork...ill do a read up on map and push
[05:35:50] <DreamyStiffy> so maybe i can understand better
[05:35:58] <DreamyStiffy> as for now kinda getting the drift
[05:36:15] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: .push is the same thing as arr[arr.length -1] = <new value>
[05:36:35] <Cork> (though you should NEVER add values to an array without .push)
[05:37:12] <DreamyStiffy> hmmm i want to ask further but not sure what to ask
[05:37:21] <DreamyStiffy> coz questions only will lead to more questions
[05:37:29] <DreamyStiffy> i need to do some reading
[05:37:31] <Cork> :)
[05:37:37] <DreamyStiffy> but thanks anyways cork
[05:37:42] <DreamyStiffy> again as always
[05:38:04] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: the best way to learn is to start doing "something" and ask or google as you hit road blocks
[05:38:46] <Cork> preemptively asking questions tend to miss the nuances you will later stumble on anyway
[05:39:25] <DreamyStiffy> that what im doing
[05:39:39] <DreamyStiffy> well at least trying to
[05:45:34] <pasteko> Can anybody help me find how to calculate the total onchange : https://jsfiddle.net/cjcuan31/2/
[05:49:10] <jomofcw> Hello !
[05:49:48] <jomofcw> Is there any core method to get the full list of an element's attributes ? Like calling .attr() without any argument (doesn't work).
[06:00:00] <jomofcw> Seems to not be.
[06:09:13] <FilipNortic__> jomofcw: think you can loop properties but don't know about attributes
[06:26:11] <DreamyStiffy> Cork or anyoneelse. How do i display "something" https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/2/
[06:27:46] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: you have an error in the console there
[06:30:33] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: http://jsonlint.com/ can help you check that your json is valid
[06:31:49] <DreamyStiffy> err
[06:31:52] <DreamyStiffy> ill try
[06:32:48] <naftilos76> Hi everyone, i have a plain text of html code that contains a tree of div tags which also have multiple data- attributes. What i want to do is extract the ids and data- attributes from the plain text. What would be the best approach? I am thinking, maybe append the html code in a hidden div and access all the divs by using method 'find' to get all divs inside the hidden container. What do you think?
[06:33:29] <naftilos76> the result must be integrated in an object off course
[06:33:45] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: think i missunderstood your question
[06:33:53] <FilipNortic__> sorry about that
[06:36:22] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: the easiest way should be to use single quotes around the value instead
[06:37:17] <DreamyStiffy> ok but quetion remains on how do i call em FilipNortic__
[06:39:02] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: don't understand what you mean by calling them... Once the json is valid your fiddle will work again.
[06:46:21] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: or do you have quotes in a json key that might not be practical / even do-able
[06:47:10] <DreamyStiffy> FilipNortic__: i have no idea what youre talking about.....
[06:47:18] <DreamyStiffy> FilipNortic__: https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/3/ did i fix it here?
[06:50:04] <DreamyStiffy> FilipNortic__: if that doesnt work let me try again
[06:52:13] <DreamyStiffy> FilipNortic__: https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/4/ how do i get GlossDef
[06:52:19] <FilipNortic__> DreamyStiffy: cheek in the console log yo still get "SyntaxError: unterminated string literal"
[06:52:35] <FilipNortic__> which means that it not right
[06:53:10] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: you shouldn't have strings around the whichever object
[06:53:34] <Cork> also you don't need " around keys in javascript, only json
[06:53:40] <Cork> (and this is an object, not json)
[06:55:00] <Cork> DreamyStiffy: so https://jsfiddle.net/9c1a5bfv/5/
[06:56:26] <DreamyStiffy> so those " were the culprit
[07:05:46] <DreamyStiffy> how do i get AXISOFSUPER and AXISOFDUPER?
[07:07:14] <FilipNortic__> employees.whichever.something[0]
[07:10:46] <FilipNortic__> whoops employees[0].whichever...
[07:24:25] <sigdk> seems that I cannot replace document.getElementById("map-center-sign") with $("#map-center-sign") here: var overlay = new ol.Overlay({ element: document.getElementById("map-center-sign") });   why?
[08:00:33] <FilipNortic__> sigdk: $() is a dom selector to get the element you need to do $().get(0);
[08:02:09] <FilipNortic__> if they where the same then you should be able to run jQuery function on thereturn of the docuemnt.getElementbyId() function, which you can't
[08:10:18] <pasteko> Can anybody help me find how to calculate the total onchange : https://jsfiddle.net/cjcuan31/2/
[08:12:53] <FilipNortic__> pasteko: the total chagne of what? do you just want the row total or du you want to calculate the change when you make changes in a row
[08:13:23] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, hmm... can I use jquery syntax to fetch the element in my example?
[08:13:45] <FilipNortic__> yes if you call get(0) on it
[08:14:02] <FilipNortic__> that give you the elemnent not just the selector
[08:14:10] <FilipNortic__> gives
[08:14:17] <pasteko> the row total first
[08:14:46] <FilipNortic__> pasteko: to start with you have the change handler inside the click handler
[08:14:52] <FilipNortic__> that can't be right
[08:17:01] <pasteko> <FilipNortic__> this : $('#total_td').text('total');
[08:17:17] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, says ""#map-center-sign".get is not a function"
[08:18:10] <FilipNortic__> $("#map-center-sign").get(0)?
[08:18:20] <FilipNortic__> this doesnt work?
[08:19:53] <sigdk> FilipNortic__,
[08:19:54] <sigdk> no
[08:22:26] <FilipNortic__> sigdk:  well that should work on all selectors so i'm don't know why
[08:30:13] <FilipNortic__> pasteko:https://jsfiddle.net/cjcuan31/3/
[08:31:00] <FilipNortic__> you need to use classes not ids when there is gonna be more than 1 of them
[08:40:41] <sigdk> taplar jfiddled this yesterday: https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/16    Any idea why this alternative doesn't show the map: https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/22/   ?
[08:42:00] <pasteko> Thanks FilipNortic__ :-)
[08:43:49] <FilipNortic__> pasteko: next for the change handler you should make it $('#tableTest').on('change','input', function() {
[08:44:25] <FilipNortic__> that listens to all input changes withing tabelTest
[08:52:09] <pasteko> FilipNortic__ : how can I access the quantity and price?
[08:52:58] <FilipNortic__> like in the click handler but lastrow = closest("tr");
[08:53:13] <FilipNortic__> $(this).closest("tr")
[08:57:21] <pasteko> FilipNortic__ : https://jsfiddle.net/cjcuan31/5/ something must be wrong :-(
[08:58:11] <FilipNortic__> pasteko: you haven't defined lastrow yet
[08:58:33] <FilipNortic__> but maight be nicer to call it changedrow here
[08:59:19] <pasteko> FilipNortic__ : sorry this is new for me :-)
[09:00:16] <pasteko> FilipNortic__ : Is because we are accessing the things by DOM the reason we can't use #ids with arrays ?
[09:01:16] <FilipNortic__> well sort of.. most id based selectors assume that getElementById(id) is unique
[09:01:43] <FilipNortic__> there is only suppose to be one of an element with id="x"
[09:02:43] <FilipNortic__> getting by class howeever expects an array of results
[09:09:42] <silverdust> I make a $.get() request to fetch responseText of an SVG file and it returns nothing. I added a .fail() and I get a 200 okay response with the data in .fail() . Why is this?
[09:10:11] <silverdust> I could go ahead and just use it but that could break or sth as it is not right
[09:14:20] <silverdust> Is this normal behavior?
[09:15:27] <FilipNortic__> no, and you aren't returning the wrong data type or somthing like that=
[09:15:29] <FilipNortic__> ?
[09:17:03] <FilipNortic__> irc if the callback expect json and you return text it might run the error callback
[09:17:58] <silverdust> I have $.get(url_to_a_svg_file, function(res){ console.log(res) // nothing }).fail(function(err){ console.log("Error", err) // expected response})
[09:18:14] <silverdust> It is text
[09:18:29] <silverdust> I guess it's expecting json
[09:19:23] <silverdust> But I don't see a place to specify datatype with $.get() syntax
[09:20:13] <fuchstronaut> how can I check if an object is an jQuery object ?
[09:21:36] <FilipNortic__> silverdust: jQuery.get( url [, data ] [, success ] [, dataType ] )
[09:21:46] <silverdust> I see
[09:22:47] <FilipNortic__> let hope that solves it there are someother wierd things that can happen which are impossible to figgure out without access to the code
[09:23:01] <silverdust> I changed it to $.get(url_to_a_svg_file, function(res){ console.log(res) // nothing }, 'Text').fail(function(err){ console.log("Error", err) // expected response})
[09:23:26] <silverdust> Now it works
[09:24:46] <FilipNortic__> fuchstronaut: like if it's a selector or just anything defined within jQuery
[09:27:57] <MikeD_> we have some experience with jquery sparkline for simple line graphs, is it worthwhile to change to d3 for new builds?
[09:29:16] <pasteko> FilipNortic__ : Big thanks for you :-) it's working
[09:31:41] <FilipNortic__> pasteko: yw
[09:33:03] <FilipNortic__> fuchstronaut: i think most jQuery objects have a jquery method that returns a string with the version. so tyoeof $varible.jquery !== 'undefined' should do it
[09:38:38] <fuchstronaut> FilipNortic__: turns out I can use obj instanceof jQuery
[09:41:20] <FilipNortic__> fuchstronaut: right i always like to use typeof instead of instanceof but I think that's a bad personal bias
[09:43:46] <fuchstronaut> having to jQuery objects, how do I push on to the other (like push)? Right now I am doing this: var a = $('p'); var b = $('div'); a = a.add(b);
[09:43:50] <fuchstronaut> there has to be a better way
[09:52:57] <taplar> fuchstronaut: $('p, div')
[09:53:35] <taplar> if it works in css selectors, you can assume it will work as a jquery selector
[09:54:54] <sigdk> Hello taplar! you jfiddled this yesterday: https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/16    Any idea why this alternative doesn't show the map: https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/22/   ?
[09:57:30] <FilipNortic__> sigdk: you removed the createMap() part?
[09:58:12] <taplar> looks like he's wanting to create it before the first modal show
[09:58:15] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, yes, I do it initially, on top
[10:00:01] <taplar> i thought it was said that you didn't want to do that if the user never clicked that button
[10:08:35] <sigdk> taplar, yeah, I'm experimenting... I thought it would be trivial
[10:08:54] <sigdk> why the alternative doesn't work? any idea?
[10:09:07] <taplar> still looking.  nothing is jumping out
[10:10:25] <sigdk> taplar, hint, if you resize the window it will appear
[10:12:04] <taplar> i think it has something to do with you trying to do the map while the #map is hidden
[10:12:12] <taplar> seems to be the case
[10:13:19] <FilipNortic__> might get the size worng that would explain why it shows after running map.updateSize();
[10:16:08] <FilipNortic__> sigdk: yeah when map.updateSize() is run it shows. but seems to center birmingham
[10:18:36] <FilipNortic__> oh it does so anyway but still not a nice solution
[10:18:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/23/
[10:19:10] <taplar> i still like the create and reset, :D
[10:20:05] <FilipNortic__> https://jsfiddle.net/10zyrLoe/25/
[10:21:03] <taplar> ah, nice
[10:23:27] <Caspan> wonting some advice on how to proceed on designing a table with a total at the bottom
[10:23:43] <Caspan> I play to make rows of the table be updateable so the sum will change
[10:23:49] <Caspan> plan*
[10:24:07] <decx> use a table for the tabular data and use another element for your total
[10:24:12] <Caspan> is it better to have a call when the table gets updated to update the total for each table
[10:24:28] <Caspan> or jsut update all tables on the page
[10:24:41] <Caspan> is it a waste to refresh all total of 5 tables
[10:24:55] <Caspan> or jstu target the one table that changed?
[10:25:35] <decx> rendering tables is expensive
[10:26:01] <Caspan> im not rerendering the tables but getting values form a data- from the TR tags then putting the totals
[10:26:35] <Caspan> so jquery would parse the data-cost tag and get a sum and put it in the SUM element
[10:27:10] <Caspan> https://jsfiddle.net/yowu0e4c/11/
[10:27:13] <Caspan> here is an example
[10:27:29] <Caspan> I want to put a div at the bottom that would add up the rows
[10:27:39] <Caspan> the data-cast tag is not there yet
[10:27:45] <Caspan> data-cost*
[10:28:48] <Caspan> but if i have 5 of these on the page i was goign to write a "go get all tables and add up their TRs then update the sum element at the bottom
[10:29:20] <Caspan> jsut curious if that is expensive to do and its better to just write code to target indavidual tables to do only that sum
[10:30:43] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, thanks, this solves the problem
[10:31:46] <FilipNortic__> yw, but it  was one of the top results when i googled "openlayers map dosen't show until resize"
[10:33:15] <sigdk> FilipNortic__, sorry, I didn't find much of help when searched
[10:33:52] <sigdk> one more question on the syntax. Currently I'm doing the following: var map = new ol.Map(...);  map.on("click", function() { ... });    Is there any way to combine these two statements into one?
[10:34:30] <sigdk> not that it matters... but out of curiosity
[10:45:27] <FilipNortic__> sigdk: not unless you can pass the handler to the custructor
[10:48:10] <Utils> How would I go about requiring jquery-ui? window.$ = require('jquery') but what would I do for jquery-ui?
[10:50:02] <FilipNortic__> did you try window.$.ui=..
[10:51:23] <FilipNortic__> but i don't use require in that way so i dont' know
[10:52:44] <Utils> doesn't seem to make the slightest difference. $(...).slider still isn't a function. also tried $(...).ui.slider but it said .ui didnt' exist lol
[10:53:39] <verax5> ajax abuse
[10:53:48] <verax5> yall heard of that?
[10:56:36] <FilipNortic__> in an xss context?
[11:06:37] <Caspan> $( 'table.BudgetRowsTable tr' )  would this select TRs of Table that have a class of BudgetRowsTable ?
[11:08:17] <Caspan> is there and easy way to show what is slected like using an echo or alert so you know you have selected what you want to use?
[11:09:12] <FilipNortic__> console.log() is usally the best
[11:10:31] <Caspan> then i can open my dev tools to see this?
[11:11:03] <verax5> yea caspan. Select stuff, store in a variable and then do console.log(variable)
[11:11:25] <verax5> this will tell you what the variabe contains you can even mess around if it has objects or something else in it
[11:12:03] <Caspan> thanks
[11:12:18] <verax5> you can also do debugger; after the statement you wish to check. This will open debugger panel where again you can inspect the result
[11:12:19] <verax5> :D
[11:12:21] <verax5> wlecome
[11:12:21] <Caspan> can i console.log($('table.BudgetRowsTable tr'))
[11:12:30] <Caspan> jsut wrap it aroud that to see
[11:12:34] <verax5> yeah sure
[11:12:39] <Caspan> awesome
[11:13:04] <Caspan> if using something like jfiddle will it give me a console to view
[11:13:26] <Caspan> or is there a better way to see output on a site liek that
[11:13:57] <FilipNortic__> no u only have the usall console
[11:14:31] <FilipNortic__> which can be a bit annoying since all the varibles aren't defined in the global scope there
[11:14:55] <FilipNortic__> but the debugger works there as well
[11:15:11] <Caspan> OMG it works :)
[11:15:13] <Caspan> sweet
[11:15:14] <Caspan> thank you
[11:15:22] <Caspan> this will help me learn
[11:15:41] <Caspan> OMG and chrome will highlight elements that are in it :)
[11:15:45] <verax5> Caspan. If your variable are in not inside other functions but available globally you can just open console and do stuff like $('table') and see the live result without even editing your document
[11:15:58] <Caspan> serious??
[11:16:09] <Caspan> learning so much awesomness
[11:16:30] <verax5> yeah because its all done on client/browser and not on the server so it's kinda easy messing with dom
[11:16:49] <Caspan> this makes it so much eaysier
[11:17:16] <FilipNortic__> They are not called developertools for nothing. If you develop clientside you want to use them
[11:18:31] <Caspan> :)
[11:22:48] <Caspan> okay so I have selected my tables and did a .each function on it
[11:23:11] <Caspan> how do i now target elm tr
[11:23:25] <Caspan> so that TR  has to be a child of elm
[11:23:44] <Caspan> $(elm 'tr') ??
[11:25:38] <FilipNortic__> $(elm).find("tr") or if it a direct child $(elm).children("tr")
[11:25:55] <Caspan> oh okay
[11:26:02] <Caspan> because it returned objects
[11:27:51] <FilipNortic__> i don't know if $(elm "tr") is a valid selector
[11:28:36] <Caspan> sorry i was trying to do a CSS selector
[11:28:45] <Caspan> or thinking of it like a CSS selector
[11:29:00] <Caspan> EML is the parent table and tr under that parent
[11:32:35] <Caspan> $(elm).find("tr")
[11:32:40] <Caspan> it does not return anything
[11:33:09] <Caspan> $('table.BudgetRowsTable').each(function(elm) {
[11:33:17] <Caspan> console.log($(elm).find("tr"));
[11:34:00] <Caspan> i want to select all tr tags inside Table.BudgetRowsTable
[11:34:53] <taplar> $('table.BudgetRowsTable tr')
[11:35:25] <taplar> $('tr', elm) is a valid selector too
[11:35:27] <Caspan> taplar: I did do that as my selector but it returned all rows
[11:35:32] <taplar> right
[11:35:37] <taplar> what subset are you wanting?
[11:35:37] <Caspan> for the entire page
[11:35:46] <Caspan> i have 3 tables with the same class
[11:35:53] <Caspan> i only want the one form the table i am working on
[11:35:55] <taplar> so sure, it would find them all
[11:36:08] <taplar> how do you define 'the one i am working on' ?
[11:36:13] <Caspan> i need to get a sum of all the data-cost tag in the TR tags
[11:36:23] <Caspan> $('table.BudgetRowsTable').each(function(elm) {
[11:36:35] <taplar> $('tr', elm)
[11:36:36] <Caspan>  $('table.BudgetRowsTable')   returns 3 tables
[11:37:19] <OnceMe> from some odd reason when I send ajax call to page with content-type: "application/json", jquery $.ajax cannot parse that, why?
[11:37:35] <OnceMe> I even set contentType: "application/json", in $.ajax
[11:37:48] <Caspan> taplar: the first run returns all TRs for the whole page..
[11:38:13] <taplar> if you do $('tr', elm) inside the each it should return only the trs for that elm, which is each table in turn
[11:38:37] <Caspan> taplar: http://pastebin.com/XsHuev4b
[11:38:39] <Caspan> thats what i have
[11:38:52] <Caspan> it loops 3 times and the first run return all TRs for the whole page
[11:38:52] <taplar> OnceMe: if your giving it a json object you don't have to set that.  jQuery will figure that out automatically
[11:39:06] <systemfault> OnceMe: jQuery works well to get json encoded data but is totally broken by default to send json data.
[11:39:15] <taplar> Caspan: make a fiddle.  i don't believe you, :)
[11:39:21] <Caspan> okay :)
[11:40:00] <systemfault> OnceMe: You need to set contentType to application/json and processData to false... then you need to send the JSON.stringify'ed object
[11:40:20] <OnceMe> well I dont send json object
[11:40:21] <systemfault> OnceMe: By default, jQuery always sends form data
[11:40:24] <OnceMe> I receive json object
[11:40:25] <OnceMe> here
[11:40:30] <OnceMe> success:function(msg){
[11:40:30] <OnceMe>   try{
[11:40:30] <OnceMe>    var obj=JSON.parse(msg);
[11:40:45] <OnceMe> it always goes to the exception, meaning JSON.parse cannot parse msg
[11:40:53] <taplar> so is msg valid json?
[11:40:54] <systemfault> OnceMe: Setting ContentType is setting the type of what you're sending, not what you want from the server
[11:41:16] <OnceMe> yea I removed that part, still no luck
[11:41:18] <OnceMe> dunno how to debug
[11:41:21] <systemfault> OnceMe: You need to set dataType: 'json'
[11:41:26] <taplar> console.log(msg) and see what it is
[11:41:40] <taplar> or put in a debugger;
[11:42:31] <OnceMe> hmm I get test: [object Object]
[11:42:38] <OnceMe> test is appended by me
[11:42:47] <taplar> so it's already parsed into an object?
[11:42:52] <OnceMe> so I get msg: [object Object]
[11:43:01] <OnceMe> how is that possible?
[11:43:04] <taplar> so you don't have to do the parsing
[11:43:11] <taplar> jQuery is checking the response and auto parsing for you
[11:43:15] <OnceMe> I know that my backend server returns json, so jquery doesnt have to parse it?
[11:44:00] <taplar> what parameters are you passing to $.ajax ?
[11:44:08] <OnceMe> ok it works now
[11:44:16] <OnceMe> it was indeed seen from jquery as a json object
[11:44:37] <OnceMe> it must be because I return Content-Type:application/json from my backend
[11:44:45] <taplar> yup
[11:45:10] <Caspan> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/yowu0e4c/13/
[11:45:19] <Caspan> look at the console
[11:46:40] <taplar> your not doing the right arguments
[11:46:48] <taplar> each(function(index, element){})
[11:47:06] <Caspan> is elm not short for element?
[11:47:09] <taplar> no
[11:47:14] <taplar> the first argument to each is the index
[11:47:18] <taplar> regardless of what you name it
[11:47:43] <Caspan> ahh
[11:47:45] <Caspan> damnit
[11:47:59] <Caspan> oh i can call it what ever i want
[11:48:12] <taplar> it IS a function parameter after all, :)
[11:48:19] <Caspan> each(function(bob, frank){})
[11:48:31] <Caspan> bob would be index
[11:48:36] <Caspan> frank would be the element
[11:48:40] <Caspan> i get it
[11:49:03] <Caspan> i thought elm and element were defined objects you wanted avaiable in this function
[11:49:08] <taplar> nope
[11:49:12] <Caspan> thank you
[11:49:19] <taplar> there are no strict naming properties in js
[11:49:31] <Caspan> thats good to know also
[11:49:33] <taplar> other than reserved ones like 'this' and 'arguments'
[11:50:28] <taplar> i can't think of a language off the top of my head that does force the function names to match the names of the variables being passed to it
[11:50:41] <taplar> err function argument names
[11:52:11] <Caspan> so now i would do an each for each of the trs and pull the attr('data-cost') and save that to a variable
[11:52:13] <Caspan> sweet
[11:52:34] <taplar> i'd look into reduce
[11:53:05] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce
[11:53:20] <Caspan> ^ reading
[11:53:41] <Caspan> ahh
[11:53:43] <Caspan> cool
[11:53:51] <Caspan> i was jsut foign to do a sum=+
[11:53:55] <Caspan> sum +=
[11:54:05] <Caspan> this works better :)
[11:54:36] <taplar> var sum = $('tr', elm).get().reduce( function(a, b) { return *something*; }, 0);
[11:54:54] <jak2000> ajpiano hi
[11:54:56] <jak2000> are you there?
[11:55:10] * taplar queues Adel's Hello
[11:56:16] <jak2000> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/rde14feo/7/   in my production, the left and right movement, work but down and up not why?
[11:56:44] <jak2000> i put ssosme alertss when user pressed down or up key and dissplay the alert but not move.... :(
[11:57:10] <sigdk> I have a form that I register lets say a user. What is the best approach to implement the POST to the backend: 1) specify on html code method, action and use a submit button, or 2) do an ajax post? why?
[12:00:26] <taplar> jak2000: are you wanting the up and down to go by column or by row?
[12:00:45] <MikeD_> sigdk: how can we know the answer to your specific use-case?
[12:02:20] <MikeD_> sigdk: if you want a flip answer, "do an ajax post" because it's what cool kids do
[12:02:29] <sigdk> MikeD_, well, what are the advantages in general of using an ajax post instead of just pushing the data to the backend?
[12:02:59] <sigdk> MikeD_, I do it without ajax post atm. I was wondering if I should change it
[12:03:25] <MikeD_> if you have an expectation that after the post succeeds that you're navigating to another page anyway, then there's no point changing it
[12:03:31] <taplar> the purpose of ajax is to perform a request that does not need the page to be reloaded as a result
[12:03:49] <MikeD_> if you had a single page application, you probably already have a compelling reason to submit forms without losing context
[12:04:25] <Caspan> taplar: sorry i am missing somethign here
[12:04:41] <Caspan> taplar: If i select my tables to get my rows
[12:04:45] <Caspan> then i select the rows
[12:05:12] <Caspan> how would i use it to get the data-cost form it and then reduce it
[12:05:19] <Caspan> reduce is expecting an array of numbers
[12:05:28] <taplar> reduce is expecting an array
[12:05:35] <taplar> what you do with each element of that array is up to you
[12:05:39] <Caspan> okay
[12:05:55] <Caspan> so do an each on each tr and get the value and add it to an arry then reduce it
[12:06:11] <taplar> no, use get() to get the array of trs
[12:06:17] <taplar> and do a reduce off of that
[12:06:17] <Caspan> if im addin it to an array is it not eaysier to just sum it at that point?
[12:06:22] <Caspan> ahh
[12:07:03] <MikeD_> are you using "tables" to mean html table tags or 'tables' to mean SQL data?
[12:07:13] <taplar> ^ yes
[12:07:20] <taplar> the first
[12:07:22] <MikeD_> because counting/summing/etc. is better done by the SQL engine
[12:07:34] <Caspan> taplar: and get requires a selector to get the data from correct?
[12:07:55] <Caspan> var sum = $('tr', element).get().reduce( function(a, b) { return a+b; }, 0);
[12:07:57] <MikeD_> oh, then disregard my attempt at a PSA for SQL :)
[12:08:18] <taplar> get() like that does not need a parameter, it just returns the array of the stack
[12:08:19] <Caspan> i woudl have to put my attr('data-cost')
[12:08:30] <sigdk> MikeD_, hmm... for a single page you meant ajax is preferable, right? makes sense
[12:08:35] <taplar> a should be the tr, and b should be 0 in that case iirc
[12:09:04] <taplar> so you'd have to do something like: return $(a).data('cost') + b;
[12:09:26] <taplar> and then each time b will be the sum from the previous iteration
[12:09:44] <Caspan> oh you do the atttr there in the function to add
[12:09:48] <taplar> yup
[12:10:04] <taplar> or if you want to go vanilla js it would be a.dataset('cost') or something
[12:10:11] <taplar> i forget
[12:10:44] <sigdk> MikeD_, what should be the answer from the backend if all good?  A json { success : true }  ? just a 200 OK at the headers?
[12:10:51] <MikeD_> if you wanted vanilla js you probably wouldn't be in #jquery, eh?
[12:10:57] <taplar> :D
[12:11:01] <taplar> just giving options
[12:12:02] <MikeD_> sigdk: if you are the only consumer of the result, you can make it whatever you'd like... if you are writing to some kind of API specification, then you should conform to that spec.
[12:13:05] <MikeD_> i would never commit to a database or somesuch without generating a transaction id record, so that'd be what I'd return to the caller... even if the caller throws it away, i've still given some token that means "here's your confirmation"  rather than simply "Yup, ok"
[12:14:28] <sigdk> MikeD_, sounds good
[12:15:26] <Caspan> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/yowu0e4c/14/
[12:15:33] <Caspan> i feel like an idiot
[12:15:41] <Caspan> its thowing an error now
[12:16:33] <Caspan> NM
[12:16:42] <taplar> :)
[12:16:47] <Caspan> A is the previous sum
[12:16:53] <Caspan> B is the current item
[12:17:03] <taplar> ah, i had them backwards
[12:17:14] <Caspan> i read the manual and jsut found that out
[12:17:16] <Caspan> go figure
[12:17:31] <taplar> you should also account for if there is no data field
[12:17:46] <taplar> ($(b).data('cost') || 0) + a
[12:20:21] <Caspan> every row shoudl have a data-cost value
[12:20:29] <Caspan> it will be either 0 or a value
[12:20:32] <Caspan> shoudl LOL
[12:20:39] <Caspan> i also programmed the templating
[12:21:50] <MikeD_> just being nosy, what do you use to assign "cost" ?
[12:23:21] <taplar> jak2000: it's not doing the cursor position check for left and right, but here is another approach you might could take https://jsfiddle.net/rde14feo/9/
[12:31:11] <taplar> mmm, want a cheese burger so bad
[12:39:09] <Caspan> taplar_lunch: so i am using this var sum = $('tr', element).get().reduce( function(a, b) { return  a+$(b).data('cost'); }, 0);
[12:39:24] <Caspan> problem is that it adds some and then joins other numbers
[12:39:36] <Caspan> i get answers liek this
[12:39:37] <Caspan> 050.001416.671968.1335.0038.9848.00
[12:39:42] <Caspan> it does not add them
[12:39:47] <Caspan> jsut joins them
[12:42:36] <Caspan> NM convereted them to numbers
[12:42:46] <Caspan> weird that it woudl treat some like numbers otehrs like text
[12:43:21] <Caspan> is it the decimal that makes it think its not a number?
[12:47:03] <taplar_lunch> not sure, possibly
[12:47:18] <taplar_lunch> usually data() is annoying in that it tries to convert for you
[12:57:50] <Caspan> i just used number() around it and it fixed it
[12:58:02] <Caspan> tahkn you for all your help BTW
[12:58:06] <Caspan> thank
[12:58:32] <Caspan> Its time for me to learn as i go then just finding outer peoples code
[13:03:47] <Caspan> $(element).parent('tr.TableTotal').html
[13:04:11] <Caspan> woudl that select the parent of the existing element and then select a tr tage with the classTableTotal?
[13:04:22] <taplar_lunch> no
[13:04:35] <taplar_lunch> your looking for the immediate parent that matches that selector
[13:05:20] <taplar_lunch> if the parent doesn't match, it's not returned
[13:05:29] <taplar_lunch> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[13:08:20] <Caspan> so if element is a table is .parent sould be the parent table of it
[13:08:30] <Caspan> no?
[13:08:40] <Caspan> was jsut reading that page
[13:08:42] <Caspan> ill play soem more
[13:08:52] <Caspan> good god type better fingers
[13:08:53] <taplar_lunch> the parent() is whatever direct element encapsulates that element
[13:09:02] <Caspan> which is another table
[13:09:06] <Caspan> okay
[13:09:07] <taplar_lunch> possibly
[13:09:19] <Caspan> in my case yes
[13:09:19] <MikeD_> tr might live in tbody instead of table
[13:09:24] <Caspan> ahh
[13:09:27] <Caspan> i got you
[13:09:36] <Caspan> i want the next table tag
[13:09:43] <Caspan> which is a parent
[13:09:50] <taplar_lunch> closest('table')
[13:09:51] <Caspan> but might not be its imediat parent
[13:09:59] <Caspan> i get you
[13:10:10] <Caspan> man jquery is powerful
[13:12:28] <Caspan> ohh i see
[13:12:45] <Caspan> because my table is in a TD tag it returns the TD element
[13:13:00] <Caspan> cool
[13:13:33] <MikeD_> "my table is in a TD tag"  = ugh
[13:13:45] <Caspan> well its a tested table
[13:13:53] <Caspan> so has to be in a TD tag of another table
[13:14:03] <Caspan> i have taabliture data i have no choice
[13:14:26] <MikeD_> yeah, i know... still reeks though :)
[13:14:33] <Caspan> i know :)
[13:14:40] <Caspan> i wish i could do it with Divs
[13:14:54] <Caspan> next step use dives with act like table CSS
[13:17:10] <Caspan> so question if i use $('table').$('tr.select')
[13:17:21] <Caspan> that will select the first table
[13:17:27] <taplar_lunch> $('table').find('tr.select')
[13:17:30] <Caspan> then select the first tr tag that matches that
[13:17:49] <Caspan> ahh the $ can only be used once then you find items inside
[13:17:56] <taplar_lunch> find all tables, then for each find the trs that have a class of 'select'
[13:18:16] <Caspan> oh yeah it returns all tables
[13:18:21] <Caspan> jsut jsut the first find
[13:18:24] <Caspan> not jsut
[13:18:43] <Caspan> $(element).closest('table').find('tr.TableTotal').html
[13:18:46] <Caspan> there we go :)
[13:18:57] <Caspan> go up one table and find this row and change its HTML
[13:19:18] <taplar_lunch> alternatively you could probably do
[13:19:30] <taplar_lunch> is element a tr?
[13:19:52] <Caspan> yeah its a TR with a class of TableTotal
[13:19:59] <Caspan> sorry
[13:20:00] <taplar_lunch> no, 'element'
[13:20:00] <Caspan> no
[13:20:09] <Caspan> Element is a table we are summing up
[13:20:24] <Caspan> then go up to its parent table and find the row
[13:20:32] <Caspan> then update its total
[13:20:38] <taplar_lunch> wait, so element is a table.  and tr.TableTotal is in another table?
[13:20:45] <Caspan> ys
[13:20:47] <Caspan> yes
[13:20:52] <taplar_lunch> k, nvm
[13:21:55] <Caspan> it sould be TD not TR
[13:22:01] <Caspan> why it was not working
[13:29:57] <Caspan> console.log($(element).closest('table'));
[13:30:07] <Caspan> so i did this and its selecting hte same teable??
[13:30:28] <Caspan> element is the table returned then i use that command and it gives me the same table
[13:30:46] <taplar> closest() can match the element it is operating on
[13:31:08] <Caspan> if its the same type?
[13:31:15] <taplar> whatever your selector is
[13:31:23] <Caspan> so i have a table selected then .closet is obviously me :)
[13:31:24] <taplar> after all, self is the closest you can be, :)
[13:31:25] <Caspan> haha
[13:31:33] <Caspan> too funny
[13:31:41] <taplar> $(element).parent().closest('table')
[13:32:06] <Caspan> i was goign to say is there a way of tricking it or say find 2nd clostest
[13:34:33] <Caspan> now we have the parent Table
[13:34:35] <Caspan> woo hoo
[13:36:50] <Caspan> so now i have it selected!
[13:36:53] <Caspan> finally lol
[13:37:03] <Caspan> i use .html to change the HTML inside but nothing changes
[13:37:15] <Caspan> tried putting
[13:37:15] <Caspan> $(element).parent().closest('table').find('td.TableTotal').html = "123123123123123";
[13:37:23] <taplar> html is a method
[13:37:38] <Caspan> ohh
[13:37:42] <Caspan> ('sdfsdf')
[13:37:54] <Caspan> noit gets data
[13:37:59] <Caspan> it does not write it
[13:38:08] <taplar> it's a getter and a setter
[13:38:14] <taplar> just like data() and attr()
[13:38:46] <Caspan> .replaceWith
[13:38:50] <Caspan> woudl that be better to use
[13:38:53] <taplar> no
[13:38:53] <arc_> i don't see why you would need to put parent().closest('table') . that seems redundant
[13:38:57] <taplar> html(newValue)
[13:39:05] <taplar> arc_: his element is a table
[13:39:07] <Caspan> arc_: not if element is a table
[13:39:16] <arc_> oh, i see
[13:39:22] <arc_> tables within tables heh
[13:39:25] <taplar> ;)
[13:40:00] <Caspan> OMG it worked taplar
[13:40:05] <taplar> heh, course
[13:40:09] <Caspan> i am now summing my tables using TR data
[13:40:11] <Caspan> :)
[13:45:36] <Caspan> how do i concat text and varialbe
[13:45:46] <taplar> +
[13:45:48] <Caspan> .html("text" . data)
[13:45:54] <Caspan> ahh was using +
[13:45:58] <Caspan> .
[14:07:57] <sigdk> Is there anything like "deserialize()" https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ ? I have a JSON and I want to map it's fields to a form (whenever there is a match)
[14:08:24] <sigdk> Ofc I can do that manually, one by one all fields, but there should be something smarter...
[14:08:40] <taplar> afaik, there is not an existing method to do that
[14:15:50] <sigdk> taplar, I found this: https://github.com/dtuite/jquery.populate
[14:16:05] <sigdk> but I think I'll just copy the 7-8 values by hand
[14:23:04] <decx> just use your key to target input by name
[14:23:33] <MikeD_> sigdk:  JSON.parse()
[14:54:32] <whoiseddie> how do I access an array in my localStorage? I've tried using var window.localStorage.getItem("subscribed") == true; but my getItem returns null or undefined
[14:54:39] <whoiseddie> and the option is either true or false
[14:55:10] <jak2000> ajpiano hi
[14:58:29] <taplar> localStorage only stores strings
[14:58:34] <taplar> same with sessionStorage
[15:00:02] <ajpiano> hi jak2000
[15:00:06] <ajpiano> i am a bit busy at the moemnt
[15:15:49] <ShaunR> How can i do this... jQuery('input[name=tld[0]]').val(); ?
[15:16:08] <taplar> put double quotes around the value
[15:16:15] <ShaunR> i have an input thats an array... <input type="text" name="tld[0]" val...>
[15:17:06] <ShaunR> tables: so you mean do jQuery('input[name="tld[0]"]).val(); ?
[15:17:13] <ShaunR> taplar: ^

[15:19:39] <jak2000> not see your post... can you copy again please?
[15:19:54] <taplar> jak2000: it's not doing the cursor position check for left and right, but here is another approach you might could take https://jsfiddle.net/rde14feo/9/
[15:20:28] <jak2000> ok

[15:23:47] <jak2000> :(
[15:23:51] <jak2000> move but not in order
[15:24:57] <taplar> lol, you know, i have to ask, since it just occured to me.  why are you doing this with javascript?
[15:25:36] <taplar> other than up and and down, the normal logic can be achieved with tab indexes
[15:26:53] <taplar> and the logic isn't going to work as is on your page because you have more than 3 inputs per row
[15:27:09] <taplar> you'll have to change that to be the number of inputs or make it dynamically find that number
[15:29:38] <jak2000> i have tabindex
[15:30:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rde14feo/11/
[15:30:16] <taplar> your read only was fubaring it
[15:34:51] <jak2000> worked now
[15:35:19] <jak2000> i ue chrome web tool
[15:35:23] <jak2000> and not ssay anything
[15:35:26] <jak2000> was the problem?
[15:35:28] <taplar> but like i said, you'll have to re-add the left/right logic that you had before
[15:35:47] <taplar> no the issue was that it was trying to focus on disabled inputs
[15:35:58] <taplar> readonly, whatever
[15:36:25] <taplar> if you look at the selector for $allInputs you'll see i'm filtering those out
[15:37:02] <jak2000> var $allInputs = $(".inputx").not('.readon');
[15:44:36] <whoiseddie> taplar: so then how can I check if localStorage.getItem("subscribed") is true or false?
[15:44:55] <taplar> you'll want to set the value as a string, and check against that string
[15:45:10] <taplar> so make it "true" or "false" and do getItem(key) === "true"
[15:45:25] <whoiseddie> kk
[15:45:41] <whoiseddie> yea currently its like this {"key": true}
[15:45:52] <taplar> yeah that's not going to work
[15:46:00] <taplar> you're essentially making a cookie
[15:46:08] <taplar> cookies are strings.  they're not script, :)
[15:47:03] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[15:48:04] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[15:49:38] <taplar> whoiseddie: if your not cleaning that up and you don't want it to linger forever, you should consider using sessionStorage, btw
[15:50:32] <whoiseddie> I think the devs rather have in on a local
[15:50:58] <taplar> what they prefer and what is logical are two different things, :)
[15:51:04] <taplar> *possibly
[15:51:08] <whoiseddie> yes true, I was going to ask anyways
[15:51:27] <taplar> the only difference between the two is sessionStorage gets cleaned up when the browser is closed
[15:51:42] <taplar> localStorage persists until removed or the user clears their browser cache
[15:52:41] <whoiseddie> yea, I understand that, I'm just curious what kind of reasoning I give them to switch if they do fire back. I'm assuming it has to do with users subscribed or not.
[15:52:57] <taplar> well what are you using it for?
[15:53:43] <taplar> and a user can clear their cache.  if your site has a requirement that that be set, then there is going to have to be logic to catch that it is missing and reload it
[15:53:50] <whoiseddie> Trying to trigger certain functions/components if a user is subscribed, so they dropped that info into a localStorage
[15:54:05] <taplar> and if that is the case, then you're always going to be doing the check anyway
[15:54:15] <taplar> so why not just load it
[15:54:52] <whoiseddie> it's for some kind of component testing that isn't in production
[15:55:16] <taplar> also that kinda feels unsafe
[15:55:36] <taplar> any user on your site could crack open their console and set that alue
[15:55:36] <whoiseddie> ehh it only affects the dom
[15:55:38] <taplar> value
[15:56:14] <whoiseddie> I mean, if they want to see a content blocker sure lol
[15:56:29] <taplar> *shrug* just thinking
[15:57:01] <Caspan> $('table#IncomeTable').find('td.TableTotal').html()    i have used that to return the total. can i remove the $ with a command so i only get a number
[15:57:17] <taplar> remove table from the first selector
[15:57:38] <taplar> and you mean '$' in the html() returned string?
[15:57:39] <Caspan> i only want tables witht eh ID
[15:57:41] <whoiseddie> I guess my concern is can you inject js through the localStorage using a chrome extension? And can that affect the DB?
[15:57:46] <taplar> IDs are unique
[15:57:49] <Caspan> ahh
[15:57:51] <Caspan> true
[15:58:16] <taplar> whoiseddie: localStorage is strings only
[15:58:19] <taplar> you can't inject js
[15:58:32] <Caspan> taplar: so when i run the command i get $56.43 returned
[15:58:34] <taplar> unless your doing an eval() against the value in which case you hit your programmer and you hit him hard
[15:58:36] <Caspan> i dont what the $ on it :)
[15:58:42] <Caspan> want
[15:59:07] <taplar> Caspan: i'd suggest changing your markup slightly
[15:59:22] <Caspan> either that i can store the total in a data-total
[15:59:27] <Caspan> text only
[15:59:45] <taplar> <td class="TableTotal">$<span class="total"></span></td>
[15:59:47] <Caspan> when i set the HTML for the TD i can also set a new tag
[15:59:54] <Caspan> ahh
[15:59:56] <Caspan> that too
[15:59:59] <Caspan> thats simpler
[16:00:03] <Caspan> :)
[16:00:41] <whoiseddie> so just an idea, if you put some ones email on localStorage, the said user can change that value pretty much through console correct? Will that also affect the DB or that will only affect the client side? I just want to understand the security risk a bit better
[16:01:13] <taplar> it only affects their localStorage.  any persistance beyond that would be through sending it else where and other logic doing further persistance
[16:02:00] <whoiseddie> Kk
[16:02:02] <taplar> if your logic blindly takes the value and sends it to the backend to store in a DB, sure, you got a problem
[16:02:26] <Caspan> taplar: worked like a charm, thank you again
[16:02:26] <whoiseddie> Yea I'm hoping that isn't the case. I'm testing against it now :p
[16:02:34] <taplar> Caspan: sure
[16:14:33] <whoiseddie> taplar: an example of what I'm working with https://jsfiddle.net/nm0ddaex/
[16:14:53] <whoiseddie> does that make sense?
[16:15:01] <taplar> your sticking a string of json in localstorag?
[16:15:29] <whoiseddie> I'm assuming they are yes, when I do window.localStorage, that's what gets returned
[16:15:53] <taplar> then your going to have to pull it out, JSON.parse() it, and then you can access the internals
[16:16:33] <whoiseddie> Will accessing the subscribed work then or is that still needed to be returned in quotes?
[16:17:08] <taplar> i'm not sure i follow
[16:17:50] <whoiseddie> like var arr = JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem('subscribed') );  still returns undefined
[16:19:20] <Caspan> $('#UnpaidTable').find('span.TableTotal').html()   what happens if this element does not exist? what will it return
[16:19:27] <Caspan> if i am using it with math?
[16:19:59] <taplar> whoiseddie: something like this, though jsfiddle restricts the use of Storage in the fiddle so it's not working https://jsfiddle.net/nm0ddaex/1/
[16:19:59] <Caspan> is there a way to say if not exist return 0
[16:20:04] <Caspan> || 0
[16:20:30] <taplar> || 0 should work so long as you don't have any whitespace in that span
[16:20:34] <Caspan> okay
[16:20:55] <taplar> i thought you were doing a span though
[16:21:01] <taplar> oh, nvm
[16:21:41] <taplar> whoiseddie: comprende?
[16:21:50] <whoiseddie> si
[16:27:30] <Caspan> any reason why doing simple math woudl return this result 35.31000000000017
[16:27:48] <taplar> cause math in js is crazy
[16:27:57] <taplar> what are you doing?
[16:28:06] <Caspan> all i did was 2033.13 - (0+ 1997.82)
[16:28:17] <taplar> 0+ ?
[16:28:29] <Caspan> yeah because the one table does not exist in this view
[16:28:35] <Caspan> so it returns 0
[16:28:46] <taplar> are either of those two numbers strings?
[16:29:08] <Caspan> i have them all returnd through Numbers)
[16:29:12] <Caspan> Numbers()
[16:29:18] <Caspan> so that numbers are returned
[16:29:20] <taplar> use parseFloat(string, 10)
[16:29:42] <Caspan> why is that, just curious
[16:29:56] <taplar> oh, don't give it the , 10
[16:30:11] <taplar> not sure exactly how numbers does it's conversion
[16:30:22] <taplar> but parseFloat and parseInt exist for turning strings into numbers
[16:30:40] <Caspan> i removed the nubmers and still get it
[16:30:44] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[16:30:50] <Caspan> 	$('.BudgetTotal').html($('#IncomeTable').find('span.TableTotal').html() - ($('#UnpaidTable').find('span.TableTotal').html() || 0 + $('#PaidTable').find('span.TableTotal').html() || 0));
[16:30:55] <Caspan> thats my line
[16:31:03] <taplar> right, parseFloat the values
[16:31:08] <Caspan> okay
[16:31:16] <taplar> don't let js do it's value coersion
[16:32:17] <Caspan> parseFloat($('#IncomeTable').find('span.TableTotal').html(), 10)
[16:32:22] <Caspan> would i write it like that?
[16:32:24] <taplar> no , 10
[16:32:28] <taplar> i mistyped that
[16:32:32] <taplar> that's for parseInt
[16:32:43] <Caspan>  parseFloat($('#IncomeTable').find('span.TableTotal').html())
[16:32:54] <taplar> yuup
[16:33:04] <Caspan> trying to understand methods
[16:33:13] <Caspan> and then .classes
[16:33:22] <Caspan> or what is it called when you do .find
[16:33:28] <Caspan> is that a object
[16:33:42] <taplar> 99% of all jQuery methods return a jQuery object
[16:34:42] <taplar> $(selector) returns a jQuery object
[16:34:48] <taplar> one of it's methods is find()
[16:35:01] <Caspan> okay
[16:35:03] <taplar> executing find() also returns a jQuery object of the results
[16:37:42] <Caspan> If i am using the console to test commands and it returns "134.43"
[16:37:51] <Caspan> then it assumes it is a string
[16:37:54] <Caspan> becuase of the "
[16:38:16] <taplar> should be the case
[16:40:19] <Caspan> its really weird
[16:40:22] <Caspan> still cant get it
[16:40:31] <Caspan> I return one item at a time and they are a number
[16:40:35] <Caspan> the proper ones
[16:40:49] <Caspan> then as soon as i do the - i get the weird answer
[16:41:19] <taplar> ya so your hitting the weirdness of js math
[16:41:44] <Caspan> how do you have two whole nubmers you subtract them and you get this
[16:41:51] <Caspan> 35.31000000000017
[16:41:52] <Caspan> haha
[16:41:59] <taplar> they are not whole numbers
[16:42:02] <taplar> they are floats
[16:42:26] <taplar> floats are way different than ints
[16:42:36] <taplar> if you remember from any comp sci classes you may have had
[16:45:11] <taplar> (2033.13 - 1997.82).toFixed(2)
[16:46:32] <Caspan> there we go
[16:46:39] <Caspan> yeah just wrapped it in that
[16:46:48] <Caspan> now looks beautiful
[16:46:52] <Caspan> so weird
[16:47:19] <Caspan> i think i owe you a few beers today

[17:12:12] <Gloomy> Hey :)
[17:12:35] <Gloomy> What's the correct way to select a link matching a pattern (regex possibly)?
[17:13:01] <taplar> pattern matching would involve regex, ya
[17:13:16] <taplar> unless it's simple enough that you can do an indexOf on it
[17:13:48] <Gloomy> yeah, I know that, I meant, how do you do that with jquery instead of regexing the whole page source :]
[17:14:43] <Gloomy> select all "a" , then get all "href" attributes, and check each one for a match?
[17:14:48] <taplar> $('a').filter(function () { return /* regex logic of true/false */; });
[17:15:27] <Gloomy> mmh sure, sorry, I meant the link adress, not what's displayed inside the a element
[17:15:43] <taplar> the href
[17:15:57] <Gloomy> yes
[17:16:10] <taplar> ya, in that filter method you'd use this.href as part of your regex
[17:16:30] <Gloomy> oh, ok
[17:16:31] <Gloomy> great
[17:16:34] <Gloomy> Thank you :)
[17:16:38] <taplar> sure
[17:47:56] <physikoi> Hello #jquery. What is the correct way to toggle a class on AND off with a delay in between to account for animation duration?
[17:48:14] <physikoi> I tried using delay but this apparently has no effect.
[17:49:42] <taplar> i don't think toggleClass involves an animation
[17:50:12] <taplar> ok, the jquery ui toggleClass has a duration and easing
[17:50:20] <taplar> so if you used that one you could use delay()
[17:50:32] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[17:50:49] <taplar> otherwise your going to have to do something with a setTimeout or something
[17:55:22] <taplar> physikoi: what are you trying to do though?  are you only adding and removing the class to get a bounce effect or something?
[17:55:56] <physikoi> taplar: that is the gist.
[17:56:19] <taplar> you might want to hit up ##css and ask them about transition/translation steps
[17:56:53] <physikoi> I could do that, but I'd still like to know the aforemention if you don't mind.
[17:57:16] <taplar> sure you can mess around with that, however it should be noted that if you can do it with css, you should, ;)
[17:59:23] <physikoi> taplar: thing is, I want immediate animation on click of element. This class must be removed afterward if subsequent clicks are to cause said animation. If there is a pure CSS solution to this, I'd be happy to learn it!
[18:17:58] <taplar> eh, looks like css doesn't have a restart.  you have to make it change state.  https://jsfiddle.net/44fnh6cy/
[18:23:12] <taplar> or even better: https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
[18:25:28] <physikoi> taplar: hm, this doesn't work. Class gets added, but there is no animation.
