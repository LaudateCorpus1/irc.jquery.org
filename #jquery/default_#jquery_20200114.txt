[08:59:50] <PCatinean> Hi guys, i'm inside an each loop looping over <option> elements and i want to know if there's a span inside. Apparently when I try to use .find on the element that's being looped over it says it's not a function
[09:00:15] <PCatinean> or do I have to do $(val).find ?
[09:00:29] <Cork> PCatinean: you can't have spans inside option
[09:00:41] <Cork> option can only contain text
[09:00:41] <PCatinean> hmm
[09:00:53] <PCatinean> ok
[22:46:24] <Starship808> is this a valid seclector? jquery("#id #test")
[22:46:54] <Starship808> if an element with id="test" is inside an element with id="id"
[22:47:47] <Starship808> or do i have to do: $("#id").find('#test')
[22:50:43] <shoky> Starship808: it's valid yes, and it does exactly the same as with .find
[22:50:53] <Starship808> ty :)
[22:51:09] <shoky> Starship808: but since those are ids, and ids must be unique, you can just do $("#test") :p
