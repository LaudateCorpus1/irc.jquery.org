[07:46:47] <Barrt> Hi guys, I have a form, and at the end of the form I can either save or edit, and when the edit option is selected the form goes to the start populated. This is using jQuery steps, for a form with a few screens to select the options. So I have a form group of checkboxes that each selection shows a part of the form, however when the edit is selecte
[07:47:35] <Barrt> Selected, one of this inputs is automatically selected and should show the respective html
[07:48:28] <Barrt> I have tried to do this selecting the input and if is checked true targetElemt.show()
[07:49:03] <Barrt> But it doesn't work, the code is inside of
[07:49:03] <Barrt> $(document).ready(function() {
[07:49:37] <Barrt> However do I have to attach any event handler, like a listener or something?
[07:50:59] <Barrt> How can I listen for that input checked and make a change, without wanting for a click or whatever
[07:51:01] <Barrt> ?
[07:51:09] <Barrt> Can anyone give me a hand on this?
[07:53:02] <undefined_bob> Barrt: I cant but others can. but you have to be patient, not sure if or when one will answer ^^
[07:53:32] <Barrt> undefined_bob,  thanks :)
[07:55:31] <undefined_bob> and if you can, Barrt, its always helpful to show some of your code in a test case on jsfiddle.net or codepen
[08:36:44] <Cork> ya, a block of text is often a sign that you won't get any help
[08:37:06] <Cork> i even have a hard time finding what the actual question is
[14:08:34] <Distraught> hello guys
[14:08:54] <Distraught> Can i with a press of a button emulate the pressing of winodws button and printscreen?
[14:09:53] <robertmaxrees> Distraught you mean throw up the print prompt?
[14:10:35] <robertmaxrees> ooooh you mean take a screenshot of the page?
[14:11:04] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm you asked in multiple channels.  good luck :)
[14:12:11] <Distraught> robertmaxrees I asked but did get no answer
[14:12:17] <Distraught> I mean Screenshot of the page
[14:12:25] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: doesn't change the topic of this channel :)  good luck!
[15:47:14] <GrandPa-G> I want to make a 2 column table that has a variable number of rows. The values in row 1 are at i=0 and i=the one after the bottom of the first column. I am looking a way to make this work. Ideas?
[16:30:29] <robertmaxrees> GrandPa-G huh?
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.
[16:31:14] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees, it is just a snake type table, down one column then continue at top of next. I might have a way.
[16:31:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there's a few different ways to do that.
[16:36:45] <jquery> input[name="appliance[combination_boiler][make]"]:enabled        im trying to look for a input by name but also not disabled, but this doesnt work, any ideas guys on the right way please
[16:37:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery make a fiddle and show us :)
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery also, if that's your selector, be aware that [ and ] are special characters that you'll need to escape.
[16:48:32] <jquery> :enable does work as it should, so i have another error,
[16:48:41] <jquery> sorry https://jsfiddle.net/b47zdwaq/
[16:48:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah ^ the square brackets :)
[16:49:16] <robertmaxrees> the arguably "better" way to do this is to not cram everything into a selector and use .filter() instead.
[16:50:38] <robertmaxrees> with a function, that is - then you can do thigs liek .prop('name') === 'whatever string you want here'.  no more putzing around with escaping and the liek.
[16:52:24] <jquery> i think your right robert
[16:52:31] <jquery> thank you for your hlep
[16:52:36] <robertmaxrees> sure :)
[16:55:00] <GrandPa-G> is there any place to get chart.js help?
[16:55:33] <robertmaxrees> stackoverflow?
[16:57:12] <GrandPa-G> robertmaxrees, been there, not finding a solution. Will some more. thanks
[16:57:25] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: can always post a question there yourself :)
[17:54:23] <z1haze> trying to figure out how to load datatables with a webpack bundle.. keep getting $ is undefined when i am requiring it after jquery ..
[18:11:05] <robertmaxrees> z1haze https://stackoverflow.com/a/28989476/923919
[18:11:10] <robertmaxrees> could be all kinds of things ;)
[18:11:28] <z1haze> yeah i think its the imports-loader
[18:11:53] <z1haze> but webpack 5 doesnt support the inline stuff anymore and i havent figured out how to do this setup the new way :D
[18:12:37] <z1haze> such as this `loader: "imports-loader?define=>false"` i think this is what i need
[18:12:57] <z1haze> but in the new format
[18:34:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i'd ask in #webpack if ya haven't yet :)
