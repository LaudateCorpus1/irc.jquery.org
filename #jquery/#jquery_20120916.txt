[00:00:46] <ordinaryman09> I'm trying to display list of images using the img src in HTML. But the way it displayed when downloading doesn't look too good. I was wondering if there's any way to make the transition before the download is complete.
[00:26:50] <MasterX1> Hi everyone
[00:28:21] <MasterX1> Quick basic question . How to fix this syntax ? //attr("src" : ("url(_images/pop/5mm_" + currentImage +".jpg"))
[00:30:28] <MasterX1> currentImage is simply a integer variable .
[00:39:48] <prishabh> scrollTop doesn't seems to work with positioned elements, what's a good alternative then ?
[00:52:20] <devslash> Im working on a web site. I have a css menu and I want my code to initiate a trigger to expand the menu down to display the menu options. I've tried calling .hover() and .focus() on the element but they don't work. my site is at http://iosdevs.org/devslash/MyMusicStreamer/
[00:59:10] <devslash> is anyone here ?
[01:02:11] <devslash> I could really use some help
[02:33:46] <pduersteler> Is there a way to find out if the data passed to $() is a css selector or a html string?
[02:34:19] <shoky> you don't know what you're passing?
[02:35:24] <pduersteler> shoky i am passing either a selector or raw html
[02:36:10] <pduersteler> shoky i feel like i should post the situation, maybe the question is wrong.. hold on ;)
[02:36:18] <shoky> it seems wrong, yes ;)
[02:37:27] <shoky> btw there's an undocumented .selector property on jquery objects.. it'll be empty if you pass html
[02:37:42] <shoky> but i shouldn't have told you that, as you shouldn't use it
[02:37:52] <shoky> so, i slap myself
[02:42:30] <pduersteler> shoky here's my "question", maybe you can give me a hint on how to write thisÖ https://gist.github.com/3731777
[02:44:11] <shoky> umm i dont understand
[02:44:43] <shoky> if it's not yet inserted into the DOM, why do you want to call applyUITo  on it ?
[02:44:52] <shoky> also what is the 'data'
[02:45:01] <shoky> and, what does this have to do with your original question
[02:45:20] <shoky> oh
[02:45:47] <pduersteler> shoky 'data' is html loaded via ajax and inserted or replaced into/part of the DOM. and the plugins (e.g, tooltips) don't gip there as they are initialited on DOM load
[02:45:57] <pduersteler> *rip
[02:45:59] <pduersteler> *grip ..
[02:46:24] <shoky> then call the .tooltip() stuff on it after you've inserted it into the dom
[02:47:32] <pduersteler> shoky i could, but i wanted to stay DRY and not call everything i need for modalbox, document.load and ajax:success, that's why i've done the applyUiTo(). there is far more than just the simple tooltip ;)
[02:47:50] <pduersteler> i hoped i could create one method to fit all.
[02:48:16] <shoky> the scope should be a DOM node that's already inserted
[02:48:27] <shoky> (or a selector)
[02:48:30] <shoky> not raw html
[02:48:44] <pduersteler> yes, but sometimes the ajax call replaces multiple things for which i don't have a selector then
[02:49:23] <shoky> e.g. var node = $(data).appendTo('body').get(0);  applyUiTo(node)
[02:49:32] <pduersteler> hmm
[02:49:55] <shoky> no need for a selector if you store $(data) in a variable
[02:50:40] <shoky> well, $(data).get(0) in my example
[02:50:48] <shoky> doesn't matter much
[02:51:16] <pduersteler> i'll try, thanks
[02:51:21] <shoky> np
[02:52:39] <shoky> you could also do  $.fn.applyUiTo = function() {  this.find(...).tooltip(); ... }
[02:53:06] <shoky> and then just call:  $('body').applyUiTo();   or $(data).appendTo('body').applyUiTo()
[02:53:14] <shoky> well. and rename it to applyUi  ;P
[02:53:45] <shoky> then you don't need to pass any scope argument
[02:53:56] <shoky> and it all chains lovelyish
[02:53:57] <pduersteler> that would be an even nicer solution
[02:54:42] <pduersteler> i also just saw that another problem is, sometimes JS comes along with the html that gets evaluated (not through eval, dare you)
[02:55:21] <shoky> yapp
[02:56:46] <pduersteler> ah, stupid me, I could initialize it there, with the  $.fn approach. thank you :D
[02:57:01] <shoky> ;]
[02:57:47] <shoky> also  'return this' at the end of the $.fn function
[02:57:55] <shoky> who knows if you'll wanna chain further ;P
[02:59:21] <pduersteler> jup, read that in the jquery plugin docs when created my own yesterday :)
[02:59:57] <pduersteler> shoky still wondering, why is .selector undocumented and "should not be used" ?
[03:03:55] <shoky> i only know about it from reading the source
[03:05:18] <shoky> and it shouldn't be used first of all because it's undocumented :P and i said that because you shouldn't be getting yourself into situations where you would need to distinguish what was passed to $()
[03:06:43] <shoky> not usually, at least
[03:12:57] <spobat> can I select all internal links?

[03:18:09] <spobat> hello?

[03:18:45] <Iszak> Anyone got suggestions on how to improve this? http://jquery-custom-build.com/
[03:19:20] <spobat> no.
[03:19:35] <Iszak> just keep it simple?
[03:25:38] <gwy> hello
[03:28:42] <spobat> hi
[03:41:04] <balloonhead_> Hi all, sorry if this isn't entirely a jquery question. I am trying to post an image from a form using jquery, then server code sticks it in a database. It works fine except the code that gets retrieved isn't a valid image file - does if get altered when it gets POSTed? How do I decode it? THanks!
[03:47:23] <Iszak> balloonhead_, no it doesn't get altered when it's sent to the server, but given you're storing it in the database I'm guessing you're reading the raw binary / base64 encoding it, that's probably where the conversion takes place.
[03:49:12] <balloonhead_> I thought that might be a problem so my fallback code just uploads it to a folder. Same problem - file appears, looks correct size, won't open, opening it in a text editor shows a bunch of image tags visible within the other random symbols and letters
[03:50:45] <balloonhead_> I presume there's still some base64 problem or something similar but I can't figure out where the problem is exactly and how to undo it.

[04:17:25] <lilleman> Basic js: foo = {}; bar = 'test'; foo.bar = 3; How can I make it so foo.test = 3, based on the value of "bar"?
[04:18:12] <lilleman> foo[bar] ?
[04:19:15] <eivindelseth> couldn't you write foo.test = foo.bar ?
[04:19:55] <lilleman> eivindelseth: The point is I dont know that bar = 'test'. bar can be anything
[04:20:34] <gnarf> Anyway - random interesting question I found on stack overflow today - https://twitter.com/gnarf37/status/247291527230005248 -- Regarding a "retry" on jQuery.ajax() calls, someone might find it interesting... *shrug*

[05:05:55] <lilleman> How can I trigger something when a checkbox is checked (not clicked)
[05:07:34] <wingy> anyone here using jquery mobile?
[05:07:37] <acies> lilleman: change event
[05:08:04] <acies> wait, why am I here
[05:09:50] <lilleman> Not change... the checkboxes can be disabled or whatsnot, I need to trigger exactly when its checked. Isnt that possible?
[05:24:08] <Iszak> Anyone got suggestions on how to improve this? http://jquery-custom-build.com/
[05:28:25] <fkm> lilleman: Can't you check the status on changes?
[05:28:49] <lilleman> fkm: yes, I do that now... but that is slower since it will trigger everythime its changed, not only checked
[05:29:36] <fkm> True. But the code that checks the status of the checkbox shouldn't be too expensive.
[05:30:11] <fkm> if ($(this).checked) { ... } or something like this.
[05:31:09] <lilleman> Aye, and now when I came a little bit further in my coding, I realize I need to take action when they are UNCHECKED also. >_<
[05:31:21] <lilleman> So .change() is actually good :)
[05:31:45] <fkm> :-)
[05:31:49] <lilleman> It seems .change() is not triggered from when other javascript is checking/unchecking the checkboxes. Is that an error? Or is there an idea to this?
[05:32:10] <fkm> Don't know.
[05:34:23] <Iszak> fkm that won't work
[05:34:42] <fkm> Iszak: Why's that?
[05:34:43] <Iszak> .checked is part of the DOM element, $(this) is a jquery object you may want this.checked
[05:34:44] <b-ot> Iszak, memorised ‚Äúchecked‚Äù.
[05:34:48] <Iszak> fuck
[05:34:51] <fkm> KK
[05:35:08] <Iszak> you can do $(this).is(':checked')
[05:36:20] <lilleman> I'm doing $(this).attr('checked')... works :)
[05:36:36] <dabear_> why not just do this.checked
[05:36:41] <gnarf> dabear_: +1
[05:37:24] <lilleman> dabear_: because I didnt know it existed. :)
[05:37:36] <Iszak> dabear_I suggested that up there ^
[05:37:45] <Iszak> [13:33:40] <Iszak> .checked is part of the DOM element, $(this) is a jquery object you may want this.checked
[05:37:48] <Iszak> but thanks for trying
[05:38:08] <gnarf> lilleman: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1414365/how-to-disable-an-input-with-jquery/1414366#1414366
[05:38:22] <gnarf> same is true for "checked" as disabled
[05:38:47] <lilleman> gnarf: oh, so I should change all attr() to prop()?
[05:39:00] <gnarf> lilleman: if you're using jQuery 1.6+ - yes
[05:39:04] <gnarf> at least for "checked"
[05:39:06] <gnarf> it is a property
[05:39:08] <gnarf> not an attribute
[05:39:12] <gnarf> know the difference
[05:39:29] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[05:39:30] <Iszak> most people who use jquery don't know the different.
[05:39:35] <dabear_> isn't it both? :p
[05:39:45] <lilleman> I dont, so I need to read up on it :)
[05:41:20] <Doxin> I want to traverse the dom using jquery, I was hoping $("blah").get() would get me the current dom, but it seems like it gives the dom like it was when the page is loaded.
[05:42:22] <dabear_> Doxin: huh
[05:42:48] <dabear_> if you call $("blah") you will get all <blah> elements as they existed when the call was made
[05:43:02] <Doxin> dabear_: sure, but how do I traverse the dom from there?
[05:43:12] <dabear_> ?find @ Doxin
[05:43:13] <bot-t> Doxin, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[05:43:18] * Iszak sigh.
[05:43:28] <dabear_> ?each @ Doxin
[05:43:29] <bot-t> Doxin, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:44:08] <Doxin> dabear_: thanks :D
[05:44:46] <Doxin> dabear_: how about changing and inserting nodes?
[05:44:59] <dabear_> Doxin: rtfm
[05:45:01] <lilleman> Iszak: I dont get any wiser on this properties vs attributes... whats the difference? I cant find a good link on google either :/
[05:45:14] <Doxin> dabear_: I am, and I can't find what I'm looking for.
[05:45:15] <Iszak> lilleman it's to do with the DOM element itself
[05:45:24] <dabear_> Doxin: see ?append
[05:45:25] <bot-t> Doxin, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[05:45:37] <dabear_> ?replacewith @ Doxin
[05:45:37] <bot-t> Doxin, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[05:45:38] <dabear_> etc
[05:45:41] <lilleman> Iszak: <input disabled="disabled" /> <-- attribute in my XML-world :)
[05:45:57] <lilleman> Iszak: How does it look if its a property?
[05:46:23] <Iszak> dw.
[05:46:31] <dabear_> lilleman: a property would not be directly visible in the source code, that's the difference
[05:47:03] <lilleman> dabear_: Now you confuse me even more
[05:47:08] <lilleman> dabear_: :D
[05:47:44] <lilleman> So its a kind of hidden js-value, not actually in the DO?
[05:47:47] <lilleman> M*
[05:48:17] <dabear_> it is in the dom, but not in the source code
[05:48:47] <dabear_> for example, an objects .toString is a property containing a function
[05:49:21] <gnarf> lilleman: it starts life as an attribute on the dom element in the HTML
[05:49:25] <gnarf> when it gets parsed
[05:49:32] <dabear_> same goes for foo.nodeType etc
[05:49:42] <gnarf> the DOM converts that attribute to be checked and defaultChecked
[05:50:12] <gnarf> when checking/unchecking you modify the property of the DOM object
[05:50:12] <lilleman> So, in theory, can I change the PROPERTY disabled to false, but have the ATTRIBUTE disabled set to "disabled"?
[05:50:32] <gnarf> lilleman: yes - and that is what happens whenever you first set "disabled" to false
[05:50:45] <gnarf> the DOM attribute is still "disabled"
[05:51:01] <lilleman> but .prop() changes both property and attribute?
[05:51:04] <gnarf> jQuery hides a lot of that from you, and tries to always do "the right thing" even when you use .attr()
[05:51:10] <gnarf> lilleman: prop is only properties
[05:51:23] <lilleman> ok, but attr() changes even the property?
[05:51:54] <gnarf> attr actually just hands it over to prop in the case of disabled/checked and a few other "boolean types"
[05:52:14] <lilleman> okok
[05:52:19] <gnarf> but-that behaviour is deprecated
[05:52:21] <gnarf> so use prop
[05:52:25] <lilleman> aye, red that
[05:52:42] <gnarf> lilleman: quick cheat sheet
[05:52:57] <gnarf> if its element.property
[05:52:59] <gnarf> its a property
[05:53:14] <gnarf> if its <element attr="test">
[05:53:16] <gnarf> its an attr
[05:53:28] <gnarf> href is another one of those crazy "prop/attr" issues
[05:53:34] <gnarf> but in the case of href
[05:53:43] <gnarf> the browser actually handles updating back and forth
[05:54:17] <gnarf> TBH - the number of uses for "attr" is pretty low
[05:54:35] <lilleman> gnarf: I'm still a bit confused, but think I know enough to use it correctly at least. :)
[05:54:48] <lilleman> Thanks for trying to get me to understand at least :D
[05:55:00] <gnarf> its a little tough
[05:55:19] <gnarf> think of "attr" as like the "html state" and props as the "DOM state"
[05:55:41] <gnarf> ?g mdn element.getAttribute
[05:55:42] <bot-t> gnarf, element.getAttribute | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.getAttribute
[05:56:41] <lilleman> gnarf: Aye. tyvm
[05:57:10] <gnarf> basically, for anything that the DOM "shadows" you probably want prop
[05:57:38] <gnarf> but to set something like "aria-described-by" etc - you need to use attr
[06:12:05] <morfin> hello
[06:12:16] <morfin> i need help with jQuery.ajax method
[06:12:31] <shoky> o rly
[06:13:25] <morfin> i don't know why but it's encoding spaces as + in Google Chrome
[06:14:14] <morfin> but i need to use %20
[06:14:22] <Haprog> it's the same
[06:14:32] <morfin> no for my appcilation
[06:14:33] <shoky> that is url-encoding, it's expected
[06:14:38] <morfin> i know
[06:14:49] <morfin> but i am using special method that expects %20
[06:15:08] <Haprog> both %20 and + will be decoded as a space
[06:15:15] <Haprog> normally
[06:15:46] <morfin> actually... QUrl can't handle that :(
[06:17:29] <morfin> if i use encodeURIComponent on parameter then hmm
[06:18:18] <morfin> i get urlencoded string that looks correct but not sure about that
[06:25:30] <gnarf> morfin: is this a GET request, or POST data?
[06:26:00] <morfin> i just replace + by %20 before decoding :D
[06:26:16] <diverdude> using gmaps and drawingmanager, i can set drawingManager.setDrawingMode(null); to deselect any drawing mode, and enable normal map panning. How do i instead enable the dragging function, so that user can resize shape?
[06:26:22] <morfin> so i think problem is solved(probably)
[06:29:28] <diverdude> any1?

[07:16:40] <prgrmrthdsmthng> How do alert() change behaviour of code?
[07:18:19] <iheartjs> prgrmrthdsmthng: it causes an alert to pop up with whatever you give it and waits for the user to click "ok"
[07:20:06] <prgrmrthdsmthng> iheartjs: and something else.
[07:20:08] <prgrmrthdsmthng> I made a function to deep copy an object. One time per aboyt 30 calls it returns garbage in one of fields that is an array. It had to be empty. But In this "special" case it is not empty, but what is strange got length equal 0. After I put that field inside alert() just to display it, it is no longer containing garbage.
[07:20:10] <iheartjs> prgrmrthdsmthng: why, is your code breaking/working because you added/removed an alert? you probably have a logic error related to some async code or something
[07:20:56] <prgrmrthdsmthng> iheartjs: well my code is pretty simple
[07:21:19] <iheartjs> prgrmrthdsmthng: yet there must be an error in there somewhere
[07:21:25] <iheartjs> prgrmrthdsmthng: can't really say without seeing the code
[07:21:36] <prgrmrthdsmthng> iheartjs: I can post it

[08:29:32] <codechewing> optraz: You have the example on jsfiddle?
[08:29:33] <optraz> codechewing: ahh.. i did it in .done(function() { alert($(this).attr( 'class' )) } );
[08:29:48] <optraz> i put that line now just below the click function
[08:29:51] <optraz> works superb!
[08:30:01] <codechewing> optraz: good stuff =)

[08:49:46] <lilleman> <input type="checkbox" disabled="disabled" /> $('checkbox[type="checkbox"]').click() <-- does not fire
[08:49:58] <lilleman> How can I catch a click on a deactivated checkbox?
[08:52:50] <codechewing> lilleman: $('checkbox[type="checkbox"]').click() should be $('input[type="checkbox"]').click()
[08:53:56] <BastianB> Hello, is there a way to get the whole document height using Google Chrome? it only gives the screen height using $(window).height() or $(document).height() ?
[08:54:17] <lilleman> codechewing: Yes, typo by me in here. It does not fire even whithout typo :)
[09:01:48] <Heather_> can someone point me in the right direction. Want to select/deselect img tags and send them togheter with an ajax request at submit click. Any jQuery function help me do this?

[09:05:19] <lilleman> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12448425/how-to-trigger-click-on-disabled-checkbox Really cant find an answer... easy stackoverflow points for you guys :)
[09:07:22] <codechewing> lilleman: because you've disabled the checkbox, the browser won't process the click event
[09:08:00] <lilleman> codechewing: ok, but I want something to happend when I click it anyways. :)
[09:08:04] <lilleman> Is it impossible?
[09:08:23] <codechewing> lilleman: you could position another element over the top of it, like a div.
[09:08:33] <codechewing> and activate the event from that.
[09:09:09] <lilleman> codechewing: Ok, but there is no way to actually fire an event when clicking the deactivated checkbox?
[09:09:40] <codechewing> lilleman: No - I don't believe that's supported in browsers...
[09:12:18] <lilleman> codechewing: Ok, thanks. Very weird not to be able to obtain it though
[09:14:15] <codechewing> lilleman: yeah - there must be a reasonable explanation for it (?)
[09:18:17] <lilleman> codechewing: Probably that the behaviour is actually wanted; a deactivated thingie should REALLY be deactivated... It still irritates me :p
[09:19:19] <sunbeam> Hi, i'm adding a Custom Post Type with a plugin. Under this CPT I want to have a settings page
[09:19:22] <sunbeam> Which add_menu_page options i can best use for this?
[09:19:27] <sunbeam> wrong channel
[09:21:34] <codechewing> lilleman: Yeah, it's a usability thing, so that kind of makes sense really. There's always a work around =p
[09:23:05] <lilleman> I dont like work arounds. :p For example I really REALLY dislike CSS selectors when there is a more complete and logic xPath
[09:28:03] <codechewing> lilleman: ha, well I'm sure that way in thinking comes in handy sometimes!
[09:29:04] <lilleman> Not when you have a tight deadline >_<

[10:26:38] <pangelovski> hi guys, is it possible to disable the navbar on click?
[10:27:03] <alexr2> yes it is possible
[10:27:44] <pangelovski> alexr2: how would i do that, i tried adding the attribute disabled = true but nothing happens
[10:27:54] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net
[10:27:59] <alexr2> give an example of what it looks like

[10:35:49] <eregi> Hi! I have a problem and I'm not able to figure out how to fix it. So, I have two div's one above other. The bottom one is a static div, it's contents wont change, but the first one will be updated after a click event, so its heigt may change. The first (dynamic) div fild fade to 0 and then to 1 when content is updated. The problem is that the lower div gets 'dropped/shaked' because the upper div height changes. To fix this I'm trying to use animate->0, slide up,
[10:37:14] * tw2113 learned the hard way not to paste, into irc, the base64 string for the jquery library unminified
[10:37:21] <eregi> the problem is that the whole proccess of animate->0, slide up, update content,slide down, animate->1 takes too long, animate->0,update content,animate->1 is faster. Any way to do slideup & at the same time? or is there a function that slides up/down depending if the height has increased or decreased?
[10:57:57] <shoky> eregi: if you wrap the first div's content with another inner div, then you can update the contents and get the new height from the inner wrapper, and animate the outer div's height
[10:58:27] <shoky> assuming the first div has overflow:hidden
[10:59:22] <eregi> shoky, good idea.
[11:14:09] <ura> hi
[11:15:28] <ura> Returning false value from event handler is equivalent for event.stopPropagation(); event.preventDefault(). Returning any other value is no-op (including returning undefined value implicitly, without return statement). Am I right?
[11:16:56] <ericw> is there a quicker method than this?
[11:16:57] <ericw> $(document).ready(function() {
[11:17:47] <ura> maybe $(function ( {
[11:18:06] <ericw> i want to run the script asap and someone is complaining about a 3 second wait
[11:20:31] <ura> if you have other scripts after your script, which are hosted on slow host this could take a time
[11:20:56] <ericw> ura (function ( { doesn't work
[11:22:00] <ura> there was a typo, I'm sorry, correct $(function () { ...}); but it's complete equivalent of $(document).ready(function () { ... });
[11:22:21] <ura> if the load time is the issue (rather than code typing time) this won't help
[11:23:07] <xboi209> I'm using jquery's .load method to load stuff from another page but I want to select a certain number of elements like $("#somediv").load("/page.html .someclass");   let's say I want the first 3 of .someclass only
[11:25:07] <ura> try $("#somediv").load("/page.html .someclass:lt(3)")
[11:26:14] <xboi209> k hold up
[11:26:22] <ericw> actually i got it to work
[11:26:33] <xboi209> k that works, thanks
[11:26:56] <ura> xboi209, I'm glad I could help :)
[11:27:06] <xboi209> oh n 1 more thing
[11:27:12] <xboi209> umm
[11:27:17] <xboi209> oh nvm
[11:27:17] <ericw> but i need to test it overtime to be sure. this blog software caches things really bad
[11:29:13] <ericw> ura: $(function() {
[11:29:27] <ericw> it appears that's the correct way. i don't know jquery. ;)
[11:29:59] <eregi> shoky, are you here?
[11:30:11] <ura> but anyway it's just syntactic sugar, it do the same as $(document).ready
[11:31:35] <ura> if you need to call handler before dom is partially loaded, you can just insert directly in html at the place when you want your handler called something like <script type="text/javascript">my_partial_loaded_handler();</script> and in function my_partial_loaded_handler do the work
[11:32:01] <ura> s/before dom is partially loaded/before dom is fully loaded/
[11:32:31] <ura> well, good night!

[13:14:43] <daveb> hi
[13:15:00] <daveb> i have a dialog. when I click on a input in the dialog focus goes to a form on the main page.
[13:15:09] <daveb> how can I troubleshoot that?
[13:15:18] <daveb> i checked and the zindex of everything looks fine.
[13:16:13] <tw2113> tabindex
[13:16:27] <daveb> what?
[13:16:39] <daveb> why would that matter if I click inside an input?
[13:16:44] <tw2113> doesn't sound like it'd be a z-index which is stacking order
[13:16:51] <daveb> ok
[13:17:07] <daveb> the dialog has tabindex=-1 on it (presumably from jquery-ui i didn't set it)
[13:18:01] <daveb> nothing has a specific tabindex set.
[13:23:12] <anli_> Is there something like a "toast" dialog in jquery?
[13:23:16] <anli_> Just a notification that will go away
[13:23:35] <anli_> Ah, I forgot to google
[13:28:20] <wingy> someone has to help me
[13:28:23] <wingy> im toast if not
[13:41:20] <ML74> I'm having some problems with editing form fields on a page loaded by ajax. Am I missing something? http://glistrr.com/system/admin   Click on Events then Add Event for the form
[13:43:36] <jrockjiggz> ML74: weird
[13:45:31] <ML74> jrockjiggz: it's probably something very simple that i'm missing :/
[13:46:14] <anli_> Does jquery provide a way of getting the focused control?
[13:46:31] <jrockjiggz> my thoughts are is missing <form>.. but it should still work without
[13:46:49] <jrockjiggz> $('el').focus()
[13:47:00] <anli_> That will focus a control
[13:47:10] <anli_> I expressed myself unclearly
[13:47:21] <anli_> I want to know which control that has focus
[13:47:50] <anli_> Seems to not  be a way to do it for all browsers
[13:47:56] <jrockjiggz> no
[13:49:38] <anli_> Ah, $(':focus') is maybe doing what I want
[13:49:39] <jrockjiggz> anli_: style.css line 56 - -webkit-user-select: none;
[13:50:38] <anli_> Worked with a charm
[13:51:05] <anli_> I was creating a "toast" dialog by removing the title bar, after 1 sec, I removed it, then I was able to put the focus back on the control that had it before
[13:51:10] <ericw> with a charm or like a charm?
[13:51:19] <anli_> removing the title bar of a normal jquery ui dialog that is
[13:51:25] <anli_> like a charm :)
[13:51:26] <ericw> how did you include the charm?
[13:51:28] <ericw> ;)
[13:51:29] <anli_> heh
[13:51:42] <ericw> i'll bbs. it's time for a reboot
[13:51:55] <ericw> spend 45 minutes clearing tabs to make sure i don't lose anything. -.-

[14:04:03] <eregi> ops, didn't paste it http://tooth.beberry.lv/trd/team There's a problem with the right side animation.
[14:04:34] <pangelovski> hi guys, I'm experiencing some weird issue when I'm in a nested list and press the back button, the navbar jumps to the top for a split second before positing itself.
[14:04:39] <pangelovski> anyone else experienced the same
[14:05:15] <eregi> After the contents change I wanted the #riderInfo to adjust height and then fadeto -> 1, it's kinda happening, but the animation somehow jumps up and down right before end..
[14:08:52] <arielserafini> pangelovski: sounds like you need to add a preventDefault to your click
[14:09:11] <arielserafini> pangelovski: do you have a link with href="#" ?
[14:09:34] <pangelovski> arielserafini: on the back button?
[14:09:45] <arielserafini> pangelovski: oh, you mean the browser back button?
[14:09:50] <pangelovski> no
[14:10:06] <pangelovski> arielserafini: i mean the query header back button
[14:10:10] <arielserafini> pangelovski: post a jsfiddle
[14:10:16] <arielserafini> and i'll take a look
[14:11:50] <pangelovski> arielserafini: cant get it to work with jsfiddle, i think its because of the json calls
[14:12:02] <pangelovski> let me try to see if i can get it to work with my webserver
[14:15:54] <pifantastic> ML74: -webkit-user-select: none;
[14:16:02] <pifantastic> that seems to be the problem

[14:18:25] <pangelovski> arielserafini: http://pangelovski.mine.nu/development/phonegap/

[14:19:41] <arielserafini> my swedish is not that great :P
[14:19:48] <pangelovski> arielserafini: click on "DRYCK" then "rˆda viner" and then back
[14:21:28] <arielserafini> pangelovski: seems fine to me
[14:21:33] <arielserafini> :/
[14:21:39] <pangelovski> arielserafini: just noticed that the bug does not happen in "fullscreen mode". but if you list is "minimised", i.e. if lets say the debug console is up and running then it does happen
[14:21:45] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i try submitting a form like $(form).submit ... but sometimes it submits and sometimes not. How can i check what's going wrong?
[14:21:47] <arielserafini> ah
[14:21:48] <arielserafini> okay
[14:22:21] <eregi> anyone, please?
[14:22:44] <Hilton> Okay, I've tried everything I can think of and everything I can google. I need help.
[14:23:06] <eregi> Krambiorix, sure that the input fields are inside the form? select all and view source, had the same issue yesterday, somehow new elements weren't added at the right place.
[14:24:06] <arielserafini> pangelovski: I see it now
[14:24:12] <Hilton> I have the following script: http://jsfiddle.net/vJqsw/ which uses jquery-ui autocomplete. I have three sets of fields (.items_l, .items_m, .items_c) which would all have identical code, EXCEPT the autocomplete source.
[14:24:19] <arielserafini> but I have no idea what's causing that
[14:24:22] <arielserafini> :/
[14:25:34] <Hilton> I wanted to make something dynamic rather than having three copies of it, but I can't figure out how. I can't get variable variables to work (thinking I could assign an attribute to the three types then define the source based on that). I can't figure out how to assign a source (or the select function) after the fact. Any ideas?
[14:26:03] <arielserafini> Hilton: it would help if you posted all the relevant code to your fiddle
[14:26:50] <Krambiorix> eregi, yes the fields are in it
[14:27:37] <Hilton> Funny. Any language I need help in, its a simple answer for a relatively simple question. I come here and it's paste your whole project (which is massive) or spend an hour building a mini duplicate. From the information provided, which is all the relevant script, you can't tell me how to make a variable variable work, or how to assign the source option afterwards?
[14:28:21] <Hilton> I've tried assigning an attribute ("codes") to each of the three types, then using source: window[$(this).attr('codes')], but that didn't work.
[14:28:38] <Hilton> I've tried running .autocomplete a second time (introducing source and the function separately), but that screws things up.
[14:28:57] <arielserafini> Hilton: I never aked you to paste your whole project
[14:29:03] <Krambiorix> anyone else?
[14:29:04] <arielserafini> and that attitude is not very nice
[14:29:21] <arielserafini> nevertheless, I noticed you said .items_l
[14:29:27] <arielserafini> your fiddle has .item)l
[14:29:31] <arielserafini> .item_l
[14:29:38] <rmurphey> Hilton: it is pretty standard to ask for a reduced test case demonstrating you're problem
[14:29:45] <rmurphey> we even have a bot command to ask you to do it :)
[14:29:47] <rmurphey> ?demo
[14:29:47] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:31:20] <Hilton> hmm
[14:32:02] <Hilton> On line 3, if it said     source: window[$(this).attr('codes')], - is $(this) still referring to the original object returned in line 1?
[14:32:17] <Krambiorix>  i try submitting a form like $(form).submit ... but sometimes it submits and sometimes not. How can i check what's going wrong?
[14:33:55] <rmurphey> Krambiorix: any errors in your console?
[14:35:00] <Krambiorix> rmurphey, no
[14:35:13] <arielserafini> Hilton: again, not trying to be a douche, but that's a little too abstract to work with. please post the relevant code to your fiddle so we can help :)
[14:35:40] <Vasistha> I have this variable I've assigned here: var t1 = $('.crf2012-time1 input');
[14:35:41] <Vasistha> I know that the selector will identify a unique input. Can I treat the variable like it is an input, and thus take t1.value, as opposed to a group of inputs, which I would not know how to deal with?
[14:35:50] <Hilton> Not abstract: 	On line 3, if it said source: window[$(this).attr('codes')], - is $(this) still referring to the original object returned in line 1?
[14:36:09] <rmurphey> Vasistha: you can get to the raw dom element using .get()
[14:36:16] <pachet> Vasistha: no, calling $ with a string selector returns you a jquery object
[14:36:19] <rmurphey> so var t1 = $('.foo').get(0)
[14:36:26] <pachet> which you can call .val() on to get the input's value
[14:36:26] <Vasistha> ah, perfect!
[14:36:27] <rmurphey> or just var t1 = $('.foo')[0]
[14:36:40] <rmurphey> or what pachet said, you can work with the first element in a selection using getters like .val()
[14:36:42] <Vasistha> beautiful.
[14:36:44] <pachet> if there were more than one element returned by that selector, calling .val() would still only retrieve the value of the first item in the set
[14:37:23] <jrockjiggz> Hilton: yes, $(this) is $("input.item_l")
[14:37:44] <pachet> Hilton, jrockjiggz, no
[14:38:01] <pachet> it wouldn't refer to the jquery object there, because you're not in a function being called with that object as its scope
[14:38:12] <Hilton> pachet: That explains why my attempt at a global variable variable didn't work...
[14:38:20] <pachet> you're just in the global scope and you're passing in an object literal to a jquery function
[14:38:36] <pachet> 'this' in that case would refer to whatever environment object you're currently in
[14:38:43] <pachet> most likely the global (window) object
[14:39:07] <Hilton> S'okay, I think I just found the answer to my original question - a second call to set the source separately, .autocomplete('option','source','item_l');
[14:39:18] <Hilton> so I can assign the select function to all three at once, and the source individually.
[14:40:10] <Hilton> or not.
[14:40:14] <Hilton> Crap.
[14:40:49] <Vasistha> alright, so if I assign t1 like this: var t1 = $('.crf2012-time1 input')[0]; Then are both of the following valid? t1.value = (some expression); t1.onchange(function(event){ some_function (params); }
[14:41:08] <Vasistha> oops, missed a closing paren
[14:42:40] <pachet> Vasistha: i'd recommend just using jquery for fetching the value / assigning the event listener
[14:42:51] <pachet> leverage it, or factor it out
[14:43:11] <Vasistha> hmm. okay. I'll rework my code. bit of a paradigm shift in the mind
[14:54:29] <Krambiorix>  i try submitting a form like $(form).submit ... but sometimes it submits and sometimes not. How can i check what's going wrong?
[14:54:43] <Hilton> Oh crap
[14:54:55] <Hilton> My whole problem was that I missed a class declaration in the HTML.
[14:55:02] * Hilton hides in a corner.

[14:57:20] <mdik> hi. is there an easy way to select attributes case insensitive (say, something that matches <a href="/tags/oklahoma"> as well as <a href="/tags/Oklahoma">)?
[14:58:11] <mdik> (sidequestion: is there a JS function only uppercasing the first letter of a string?)
[15:00:18] <Hilton> mdik: Ordinary JS string functions -> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp
[15:00:22] <johnkpaul> ?filter #md
[15:00:22] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/#md
[15:00:29] <johnkpaul> ^@mdik
[15:00:58] <johnkpaul> pass a function that checks against a case insensitive regex
[15:01:36] <eregi> Here's my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/K2DgQ/16/ I need to achive that if the height of #riderInfo changes, then it should slide down'up accordingly, so the bottom div wouldn't 'jump'..
[15:02:28] <johnkpaul> ?eval var out=[]; var regex = /oklahoma/i;out.push(regex.test("oklahoma"));out.push(regex.test("Oklahoma"));out;
[15:02:30] <bot-t> johnkpaul: [true, true]
[15:02:41] <johnkpaul> ^ @ mdik
[15:04:24] <Vasistha> how does this look? var sum = 0; $('.validate-time input').each (function (sum) { sum = sum_times (sum, $(this).val()); });
[15:04:47] <mdik> Hilton: i don't see what i'm searching for. but thank you anyway.
[15:05:08] <mdik> johnkpaul: i understand your hint, sadly not your example...
[15:05:59] <Hilton> mdik: Unless there is a function I'm not aware of, what you need to do is copy the first character with substr(), use toUpperCase() on it, then replace the original character with substr().
[15:06:24] <mdik> Hilton: yes. i know
[15:07:06] <mdik> and johnkpaul: second read brought understanding. thank you.
[15:07:22] <johnkpaul> mdik: no problem, have fun!
[15:08:22] <Hilton> (string) = (string).substr(0,1).toUpperCase() + (string).substr(1); or something like that, I'm sure that's wrong.
[15:08:59] <Hilton> Google gives me function capitaliseFirstLetter(string) { return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1); }
[15:09:04] <Hilton> I'm so dumb :P
[15:09:25] <mdik> johnkpaul: ok. one follow up: how do i drop a variable string into the regex?
[15:10:01] <johnkpaul> mdik: you need to use the RegExp constructor
[15:10:07] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn RegExp() @ mdik
[15:10:08] <bot-t> mdik, Regular Expressions | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[15:10:45] <johnkpaul> mdik: something like new RegExp('oklahoma','i')
[15:10:50] <eregi> anyone, please?
[15:15:02] <Hilton> eregi, I haven't got time to write it and test it, but http://api.jquery.com/resize/ - bind to that event, and when called, force the element back to its old size and start an animation.
[15:17:11] <eregi> Hilton, will take a look, hopefully it will work - wasted few hours figuring this out and should go to sleep asap. Thanks!
[15:18:34] <Vasistha> is $(this) a jquery object or a dom element?
[15:18:41] <mdik> thanks alot
[15:19:21] <Vasistha> hum, maybe some context is needed: $('.validate-time input').each($(this).onchange(function (event) { add_my_time_into ($(this), time_sum); }));
[15:22:27] <Vasistha> well... I guess it's not valid... because it's not working. javascriptlint.com doesn't have any issue with it, at least
[15:24:11] <eregi> hmn, not sure if the resize is the best way to go, anyone else has recomendations based on my code?
[15:27:29] <rmurphey> Vasistha: you need to pass .each a function
[15:27:36] <rmurphey> rather than a statement
[15:27:56] <Vasistha> hum. okay. let me think about how I'm gonna do that. thanks.
[15:28:34] <rmurphey> Vasistha: just wrap what you're trying to do in function() { ... }
[15:28:48] <rmurphey> though then you'll end up wiht an issue with this
[15:29:27] <Vasistha> rmurphey: well... how does this one look? $('.validate-time input').each(add_my_time_into ($(this), time_sum));
[15:29:35] <rmurphey> that's still a statement
[15:29:42] <rmurphey> you need to pass a function, not call a function
[15:29:50] <Vasistha> oh... right...
[15:29:58] <rmurphey> $('.validate-time input').each(function() { ... });
[15:30:13] <rmurphey> the function will get the index of the element, and the element itself, as its argument
[15:30:17] <rmurphey> arguments
[15:32:02] <McCuz> hey
[15:32:07] <McCuz> Is there a way to select only a specific portion of the text in the input field?
[15:32:19] <Vasistha> So... the function I call has to accept params index, element? I was hoping to call a function that took also a different parameter of my specification
[15:33:14] <Vasistha> although wait... I'm getting ahead of myself... this function needs to assign an event handler, I'm still a step away
[15:36:11] <eregi> rmurphey, could you please look at the jsfiddle that I posted previously? Need some advice..
[15:36:22] <pangelovski> i have this strange issue. if i have scrolled to the end in a nested listview and  click back, my navbar jumps to the centre of the page for a split second nd then positions itself as normal

[15:48:18] <GoHuyGo> hi
[15:48:39] <GoHuyGo> playing with jquery and trying to get the jqueryrotate lib to work
[15:48:40] <GoHuyGo> http://pastie.org/4734662
[15:48:43] <GoHuyGo> I'm having some trouble though
[15:54:47] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: you need to load jquery as well
[15:55:13] <GoHuyGo> arielserafini: ty, I will look it up :)
[15:55:17] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:57:59] <McCuz> i guess it's morning for some ^^
[15:58:48] <GoHuyGo> arielserafini: how do you load jquery?
[15:59:30] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[15:59:42] <arielserafini> add that line
[15:59:43] <arielserafini> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[15:59:53] <arielserafini> before your jqueryrotate line
[16:05:38] <rogo> why a double fade on last two elements ?? http://jsfiddle.net/cR9bJ/16/
[16:06:09] <GoHuyGo> arielserafini, I've added it, but it is still not working
[16:06:10] <GoHuyGo> also
[16:06:19] <GoHuyGo> both the link and script you posted
[16:06:27] <GoHuyGo> has the source as  src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js"
[16:06:35] <arielserafini> yes
[16:06:38] <GoHuyGo> should i add "http:" before ajax?
[16:06:43] <GoHuyGo> /ajax**
[16:06:46] <arielserafini> that's not necessary
[16:06:53] <arielserafini> the // just means it's protocol independent
[16:07:01] <arielserafini> you can add http, sure
[16:07:03] <arielserafini> it'll work
[16:07:20] <arielserafini> but if someone is accessing your page using https they'll get an insecure content warning
[16:07:30] <GoHuyGo> http://pastie.org/4734741
[16:10:04] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: use jsfiddle, it's better for collaborative testing: http://jsfiddle.net/872Ra/
[16:10:49] <GoHuyGo> arielserafini: i was able to get it to work on jsfiddle
[16:11:05] <GoHuyGo> I'm trying to move everything over to an html document
[16:12:49] <McCuz> http://pastebin.com/dUbjQpZi 3 lines of code, help appreciated
[16:13:16] <McCuz> Is this possible? If so, can you provide a sample, or point me in the right direction?
[16:14:14] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: http://jsfiddle.net/872Ra/1/
[16:14:17] <arielserafini> try this
[16:17:56] <GoHuyGo> I got to to work
[16:17:59] <GoHuyGo> ty arielserafini
[16:18:05] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: what was it?
[16:18:06] <GoHuyGo> My script had to go after my img for some reason
[16:18:13] <GoHuyGo> I'll show you
[16:18:23] <GoHuyGo> http://pastie.org/4734776
[16:18:29] <GoHuyGo> is there a reason why the script has to go after the img tag?
[16:21:55] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: look at the last link i sent you
[16:23:09] <GoHuyGo> ahhh
[16:26:09] <GoHuyGo> cool that makes it work everywhere
[16:26:58] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: that's equivalent to using $(document).ready
[16:27:14] <arielserafini> basically it waits for the entire page to be loaded
[16:27:17] <GoHuyGo> This is actually my first time putting something in jQuery together
[16:27:22] <GoHuyGo> ahhh
[16:27:33] <arielserafini> that's why you were able to make it work using the script after the image
[16:27:48] <GoHuyGo> so the line you gave me
[16:27:54] <GoHuyGo> basically says wait until the entire page to be loaded
[16:27:58] <GoHuyGo> before allowing click?
[16:33:37] <myrman> I'm using a jquery pagination plugin to auto-load the next page in my portfolio, but my lightbox only recognises the elements that were present on page load. What can I do about this?
[16:34:16] <coldhead> reapply the lightbox when the new stuff gets loaded
[16:34:59] <coldhead> if the paginator doesn't offer a callback for when new content is loaded you might be able to bind to the ajaxComplete event
[16:36:45] <wingy> why does it say use on() instead of bind() in the doc
[16:37:12] <wingy> what is the diff?
[16:37:47] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: yes, before running any code inside that
[16:38:34] <coldhead> wingy: all the diverse ways of binding event handlers in older jQuery verions are being consoolidated into the one on()/off() system
[16:38:52] <wingy> coldhead: so bind() will be deprecated?
[16:39:07] <tw2113> already is
[16:39:11] <tw2113> in 1.7 i think
[16:39:13] <wingy> click() as well?
[16:39:27] <arielserafini> wingy: yes, click is a shorthand method
[16:39:36] <wingy> okay then
[16:39:38] <myrman> coldhead: I'm trying to call the lightbox with "Shadowbox.init();" but it doesn't reapply
[16:39:40] <wingy> jquery mobile is using bind()
[16:39:47] <wingy> ill change those to on()
[16:40:40] <huntedmitch> Hey guys! I am using a fairly basic implementation of the jQuery UI Autocomplete with a whole bunch of music artist data. For some reason when I hit the space bar the space actually gets deleted, then after I hit it maybe 2 or 3 more times it will actually show up. Anyone have any idea why this might be happening?
[16:48:12] <coldhead> myrman: check the docs for your lightbox, there may be another way to re-init it for new content
[16:48:21] <coldhead> and if there isn't you might like to try a new lightbox :(
[16:48:43] <myrman> Thank you, I found the answer in the docs
[16:49:38] <tw2113> whoa?answers provided by documentation
[16:50:07] <GoHuyGo> http://jsfiddle.net/xw89p/1844/
[16:50:17] <GoHuyGo> I'm trying to select a random element from my array
[16:50:25] <myrman> tw2113 :)
[16:50:36] <GoHuyGo> any tip?
[16:51:49] <Vasistha> Having trouble figuring out this jquery stuff... I just don't understand how to get from document.ready, to .each(), to assign an .onchange
[16:51:51] <Vasistha> http://pastie.org/4734881
[16:51:53] <shoky> GoHuyGo: parseInt
[16:52:39] <shoky> GoHuyGo: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xw89p/1846/
[16:53:08] <GoHuyGo> ahh ty
[16:53:10] <GoHuyGo> shoky ty shoky
[16:53:53] <GoHuyGo> I figured an integer would be stored in random when you run Math.random + Math.floor
[16:54:09] <shoky> Math.floor returns an integer
[16:54:16] <shoky> but you're doing arr[Math.floor(...)]
[16:54:18] <coldhead> the array is of strings
[16:54:20] <shoky> which is a string
[16:54:39] <coldhead> Vasistha: this seems quite convoluted, what are you trying to do?
[16:54:42] <GoHuyGo> ahhh
[16:54:53] <GoHuyGo> ty
[16:55:29] <Vasistha> coldhead: I want to assign an onchange function to all of the inputs that descend from a class validate-time
[16:56:25] <rgr> yor call from each is wrong
[16:56:49] <rgr> and out of curiosity whats the $ parameter?
[16:57:37] <coldhead> Vasistha: http://jsfiddle.net/vNcYe/
[16:57:40] <shoky> Vasistha: $(elem).change
[16:57:44] <coldhead> that's a more jQuery way of doing it
[16:57:48] <coldhead> whatever it is :)
[16:58:03] <shoky> elem.onchange is not a function
[16:58:06] <Vasistha> thank you guys so much!!
[16:58:16] <shoky> that is, not one you should be calling
[16:58:44] <rgr> wats with "elem"?
[16:59:05] <shoky> $ parameter is jQuery
[16:59:14] <shoky> which is passed to the doc ready callback
[17:01:07] <shoky> ?demo @ huntedmitch
[17:01:07] <bot-t> huntedmitch, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:01:08] <Vasistha> coldhead: is it a requirement for add_my_time_imto to be defined within document.ready, or can I define it outside?
[17:01:40] <shoky> Vasistha: not required
[17:01:48] <huntedmitch> shoky: Not an issue now. Turns out one of the guys was validating the input and trimming the value. D'oh!
[17:01:56] <Vasistha> also I wonder... where is it being specified that the function will be called "onchange"?
[17:02:12] <shoky> Vasistha: the jquery function is called change
[17:02:37] <Vasistha> shoky: okay... but it doesn't appear anywhere now! :)
[17:02:43] <shoky> what?
[17:03:30] <shoky> heh coldhead's fiddle's got it a bit wrong
[17:03:37] <shoky> (no wonder..)
[17:04:10] <Vasistha> well okay... um... what would coldhead's fiddle do? Would it call the function at load time only?
[17:05:01] <shoky> yeah he didn't put a 'change' handler, and he put $(this).  infront of the call to add_my_time_into   which wouldn't work
[17:05:29] <coldhead> fuck you, shoky, you ain't the boss of me
[17:05:41] <coldhead> it's 10am monday and i'm drunk as hell already
[17:05:46] <coldhead> this is the las tthing i need
[17:05:49] <coldhead> i'll kill you all
[17:05:53] <shoky> ha ha
[17:05:58] <coldhead> worst rosh hashanah ever
[17:06:04] <shoky> LOL
[17:06:12] <Vasistha> pffff
[17:06:14] <Vasistha> hahaha
[17:06:57] <shoky> maybe you'll learn some jquery this year
[17:07:01] <Vasistha> the "convoluted" thing I had before was the result of my asking questions here... questions I have been asking for hours... which have not been satisfactorily answered...
[17:07:17] <tw2113> shitty first day coldhead ?
[17:07:56] <shoky> Vasistha: i think this is what you wanted.. not sure http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vNcYe/1/
[17:08:43] <Vasistha> thanks shoky!! Let's see how it goes now :)
[17:09:16] <Vasistha> shoky: oh how interesting... so we don't use .each at all, when we use .change it automatically does it for all of them?
[17:09:20] <shoky> yaps
[17:10:23] <shoky> oops extra });  in there
[17:10:24] <rgr> Vasistha: you might use on each if you needed to access a Data() record for each element for example.
[17:10:36] <coldhead> that's an important concept, the chaining and "set" stuff
[17:11:42] <Vasistha> how would I just call a function, right now, with parameters that I provide, for each of the members of $('.someclass') ?
[17:11:43] <tw2113> chaining and whipping oh my
[17:13:12] <coldhead> you would use each(), Vasistha
[17:13:13] <shoky> Vasistha: if it's just a regular function, then probably with .each
[17:13:35] <Vasistha> but with .each, don't I have to create a function that takes index and elem... as an intermediary... or something like that?
[17:13:50] <shoky> yes
[17:14:01] <shoky> (you can omit the arguments and just use 'this' though)
[17:14:20] <Vasistha> could I maybe see an example?
[17:14:42] <shoky> $('.someclass').each(function() { myFunc(this,2,'lol') })
[17:15:07] <Vasistha> ah, interesting, so you can add some other params there
[17:15:20] <shoky> any code that you like
[17:15:43] <Vasistha> "any code I like" in jquery usually is full of errors
[17:15:54] <shoky> that's not code we like then ;p
[17:16:00] <tw2113> shoky, what would the 2 represent?
[17:16:08] <shoky> tw2113: yin & yang
[17:16:12] <tw2113> the limit?
[17:16:22] <shoky> wat..?
[17:16:22] <b-ot> Our message to JQuery developers is "if you know JQuery, you know JQ.Mobi" and, similar to Java Micro Edition, in the JQ.Mobi version not every aspect of other JQuery editions are available in the JQ.Mobi version
[17:16:32] <Vasistha> yet still my head is swimming :P I keep losing sight of my original goal, due to such immense confusion. Let me just say it one more time: Each time one of the "time" fields change, I want to update the "sum time" field to reflect the sum of all the time fields.
[17:16:44] <Vasistha> It ... seems like it ought to be a pretty simple thing to do.
[17:16:47] <tw2113> i=0, i< foo.length, i++
[17:16:55] <tw2113> the foo.length part
[17:17:05] <shoky> what
[17:17:12] <shoky> i just made up a function call
[17:17:16] <tw2113> nevermind
[17:17:17] <shoky> with made up arguments
[17:17:24] <tw2113> just realized it wasn't part of the each func
[17:17:28] <shoky> heh
[17:17:39] <tw2113> *goes back to his corner with coldhead *
[17:17:51] <shoky> *throws you guys an egg*
[17:17:57] <shoky> share!
[17:18:24] * tw2113 gives it all to coldhead 
[17:18:35] <shoky> egghead
[17:19:07] <coldhead> Vasistha: stay calm, you'll work it out. try to keep the jQuery philosophy in mind of maximum laziness and convenience. whatever seems like the easiest and most convenient way to do something is probably how it's done
[17:19:27] <Vasistha> lazy would be using a language I know hehe
[17:19:39] <shoky> .waxIn().waxOut()
[17:21:14] <tw2113> you forgot .bow()
[17:22:24] <Vasistha> okay, here's a thought. So, there are going to be 3 time inputs on the page, and then a spot for their sum. Whenever any of the inputs changes, the sum should be updated via a change event. Now: does it make sense to store the 3 inputs in a variable, and keep that while the page is loaded? Or is javascript ... uh ... "stateless" if I'm using that term properly?
[17:22:48] <shoky> wait, coldhead, 10am monday? where tf are you
[17:23:13] <Vasistha> (meaning that variables aren't stored between, say, document.ready and a change event firing later on)
[17:25:10] <shoky> Vasistha do you mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vNcYe/2/
[17:25:27] <shoky> (regarding what you asked for before, at least)
[17:25:44] <Vasistha> shoky: yes, close, although times look like 3:45
[17:26:25] <coldhead> australia, shoky
[17:26:32] <coldhead> australia, the future

[17:28:40] <coldhead> shoky: it's very faintly evidenced in my british spellings and references to wallabies and dingos
[17:28:50] <tw2113> and missing babies?
[17:28:53] <shoky> Vasistha: yeah, unless sum is meant to be in xx:yy too
[17:28:55] <tw2113> *runs*
[17:29:21] <shoky> Vasistha: but why are we not using a real fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vNcYe/4/
[17:29:21] <Vasistha> shoky: it is, but it accepts 0 as a starting value
[17:29:25] <coldhead> steve irwin took my baby
[17:29:32] <coldhead> well referenced, tw2113
[17:29:38] <Vasistha> shoky: I made one earlier and nobody looked at it :P should have dug it up
[17:29:51] <tw2113> i'm aware of the Chamberlains in general
[17:30:02] <coldhead> you run a fan site on geocities?
[17:30:09] <tw2113> yes

[17:30:53] <Ram__> i tried using action="javascript:showForm('employees/add_employees.php')" in the form i bring but is  not working...btw thats the function i use to call the page
[17:31:52] <shoky> Vasistha: well sure, if add_mm_ss_times is written properly then it makes sense
[17:31:57] <Vasistha> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/ct4up/2/
[17:33:08] <shoky> Vasistha: ReferenceError: secs_or_false_from_mm_ss_time is not defined

[17:50:48] <shoky> main error was you treated the value of sum as a time string instead of an integer, in add_mm_ss_times
[17:52:00] <shoky> i just changed it to .split cause it's less painful than using indices
[17:59:53] <djsounds02> Hey there guyssss
[18:01:04] <djsounds02> Im well confused!!
[18:01:35] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[18:01:42] <coldhead> is it a relationship problem?
[18:01:51] <coldhead> mixed signals from your lady friend?
[18:01:59] <tw2113> strange bumps?
[18:03:55] <Vasistha> weak typing is so much work... can't rely on anything...

[18:04:23] <RohanBhangui> any help problem is in the fiddle file
[18:04:36] <RohanBhangui> dont want to change html structure (for reasons)
[18:06:19] <alexr2> You aren't using the correct selector
[18:06:34] <alexr2> When selecting by class, you need to precede it with a .
[18:06:44] <alexr2> so $(".point")
[18:07:00] <RohanBhangui> y bad\
[18:07:03] <RohanBhangui> ya i saw that
[18:07:24] <RohanBhangui> any solution to hcecking for children (direct children i mean)
[18:07:34] <alexr2> Look into ">"

[18:10:36] <djsounds02> http://alpha360test.co.uk/bangle_box/
[18:10:43] <RohanBhangui> but i wanna check whter the
[18:10:50] <coldhead> good idea, djsounds02
[18:10:52] <RohanBhangui> script is really selecting those direct children
[18:10:59] <RohanBhangui> but i have no idea of checking
[18:11:07] <djsounds02> coldhead: is it you im going to be adressing on this issue?
[18:11:10] <RohanBhangui> i tried console.log($(this));
[18:11:14] <RohanBhangui> but that doesnt work
[18:11:21] <RohanBhangui> any ideas?
[18:11:35] <alexr2> Rohan, you aren't looping over anything
[18:11:47] <alexr2> if you put it in an ? each @ RohanBhangui
[18:11:52] <alexr2> ?each @ RohanBhangui
[18:11:52] <bot-t> RohanBhangui, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[18:12:03] <alexr2> Then you can use $(this)

[18:12:38] <RohanBhangui> so $(this).each?
[18:12:40] <coldhead> address the whole channel, djsounds02
[18:12:54] <coldhead> it's only my first day using jQuery but we'll all try to help
[18:12:55] <alexr2> RohanBhangui, read that page
[18:12:58] <alexr2> The whole thing
[18:13:03] <RohanBhangui> oaky
[18:13:38] <coldhead> what are we looking at here, djsounds02?
[18:15:46] <djsounds02> http://alpha360test.co.uk/bangle_box/
[18:15:46] <djsounds02> On this link you will find a slider, its height is on the element classed 'slides_control' declared through the jQuery code found at http://alpha360test.co.uk/bangle_box/wp-content/themes/bangle-box/js/slides.min.jquery.js
[18:15:46] <djsounds02> I dont know why it is doing this or how, I want to just set height via css stylesheet though.
[18:19:40] <coldhead> djsounds02: i don't see any CSS rule to set the height of the .slides_control
[18:19:50] <coldhead> i do see that it's being set via jQuery
[18:20:04] <coldhead> can you not overrule that with .slides_control {height:100px!important}
[18:20:07] <coldhead> or whatever you need?
[18:20:19] <djsounds02> I guess I could yes, I just wanted to rip the jquery part out too
[18:22:06] <coldhead> it's better to keep things simple and not edit the plugin
[18:25:25] <bluesnow> Hi, I'm wondering how BSD / MIT style licenses should be included in client side javascript files.
[18:25:39] <bluesnow> Does the entire license need to be copied, or is an URL to the license okay?
[18:25:56] <McCuz> can anyone help? http://pastebin.com/k9yCctby
[18:26:09] <coldhead> that's a matter of some debate, bluesnow
[18:26:32] <coldhead> many people make do with just the URL
[18:26:34] <bluesnow> coldhead: It would just be safest to include the entire text of the license in the js file, then?
[18:26:38] <coldhead> and i am not aware of any legal dramas with that
[18:26:43] <coldhead> it's an accepted practice
[18:27:10] <coldhead> some people do include the entire license
[18:27:40] <RohanBhangui> alexr2: thx for the help
[18:27:42] <coldhead> i would have qualms with using the bandwidth for text no one is likely to see
[18:28:03] <bluesnow> coldhead: Okay. It would only need to be included in the javascript file itself right, not on the website?
[18:30:34] <coldhead> yes, that's my understanding
[18:30:48] <coldhead> BSD is much more liberal about these things, people are more aggressive about GPL
[18:31:17] <coldhead> esp. with the Affero GPL
[18:31:26] <tw2113> they should have switched to WTFPL
[18:32:03] <bluesnow> Ah, I see.
[18:37:14] <coldhead> bluesnow: i will never forget the time we spent together
[18:38:45] <Ram__> hey guys is there anything wrong with this function?
[18:38:48] <Ram__> http://pastebin.com/DnjYyDMQ
[18:41:59] <coldhead> looks okay to me, Ram__
[18:42:18] <coldhead> i'd probably add dataType: 'html' to help jQuery interpret the results correctly
[18:43:06] <Ram__> well
[18:43:11] <Ram__> not working =(
[18:43:29] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination
[18:43:37] <coldhead> can you be more specific?
[18:43:43] <coldhead> or link to a demo?
[18:43:46] <coldhead> or both?
[18:44:45] <rmurphey> Ram__: what about it isn't working?
[18:45:01] <rmurphey> and what do you see in your browser dev tools network tab?
[18:45:10] <Ram__> coldhead:  i need to bring one page inside a div once i click the link..
[18:45:27] <Ram__> then i should submit it
[18:45:37] <Ram__> the form
[18:46:46] <Ram__> i click the link but i dont get the page with the form
[18:48:23] <rmurphey> Ram__: there are a lot of ways it could be failing
[18:48:34] <rmurphey> have you looked at the network tab of your browser's dev tools?
[18:48:40] <rmurphey> you need to see if the request is being sent
[18:48:42] <rmurphey> and what is being returned
[18:48:46] <rmurphey> and whether there are any errors
[18:49:35] <Ram__> rmurphey: it works when i do this http://pastebin.com/TyWu95BG.. but i can only bring the form.. when i try to submit it goes away
[19:05:11] <coldhead> phone calls, strip malls, i don't wanna leave you behind
[19:33:56] <sisb> coldhead where do you work
[19:35:49] <coldhead> nowhere interesting, sisb
[19:35:58] <sisb> coldhead: :/
[19:36:24] <coldhead> it's true!
[19:36:30] <sisb> I had imagined greatness.  In my mind you slew JavaScript demons, not just bugs, on a nightly basis.
[19:36:51] <coldhead> oh god no, i spend most of my time saving images out of photoshop
[19:37:02] <coldhead> then saving new images when it's redesigned
[19:38:02] <sisb> How many designs can there possibly be?
[19:38:18] <coldhead> it seems pretty much constant
[19:38:48] <sisb> On a single concept, or new sites constantly?
[19:39:16] <coldhead> a couple of main projects and a bunch of clienty microsites
[19:39:50] <sisb> What an unfortunate waste of talent
[19:40:13] <coldhead> aw shucks
[19:40:14] <coldhead> it'll pass
[19:48:10] <bontaq> hey guys, I was wondering if someone could help out a nubcake a little? c:
[19:48:29] <coldhead> can you be more specific
[19:48:35] <tw2113> can you post your question
[19:48:38] <tw2113> we can't read minds
[19:48:41] <tw2113> we need one first
[19:48:48] <bontaq> There's this minor, annoying bug with my site where after I do a fade-in and the function completes, the results shift down
[19:49:29] <tw2113> *golf claps for the bug*
[19:49:40] <bontaq> if you go to whenbus.com, type, "18 car" into the search bar, wait a sec, then select the stop results for bus times will show up
[19:49:56] <bontaq> I'm just trying to figure out if it's jquery correcting something, or my own ignorance
[19:51:10] <tw2113> i'm not seeing a shift
[19:51:36] <coldhead> its probably something with display:inline being changed to display:block for the animation
[19:51:53] <tw2113> *hugs firefox aurora*
[19:52:28] <sisb> Think it's something with your extra <p>s
[19:52:44] <sisb> Code your markup first, then work on the animation
[19:54:20] <iLogic> $('selector').last( $('<a />').attr('href','#'); ); <- how is this method of inserting content while using it as hook called?
[19:57:59] <ML74> Having some problems‚Ä¶ page is reloading when $.ajax is called :/
[20:02:22] <coldhead> iLogic: i;m not sure there is a name for that
[20:02:51] <coldhead> ML74: are you sure it's the ajax that's doing that, and not your clicking on an <a> or a submit button?
[20:02:56] <iLogic> coldhead: but do you know since what version it exists?
[20:02:58] <coldhead> ?preventDefault @ ML74
[20:02:59] <bot-t> ML74, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[20:03:35] <iLogic> i'm trying it on 1.6.4 and it doesn't seem to work
[20:03:37] <coldhead> iLogic: i would look at the docs for last(), or failing that at some recent changelogs
[20:04:11] <coldhead> iLogic: does what you're trying to do work anywhere?
[20:04:16] <coldhead> i haven't used last() in that way
[20:04:16] <iLogic> not the last() function, but open/close tags like $('<a />')
[20:04:31] <coldhead> that's been in for a long time
[20:04:39] <coldhead> but the browser helps
[20:05:06] <coldhead> and that may screw up becuause <a /> is not valid without an href or a name (i think)
[20:05:09] <iLogic> I'm trying to add an <a> tag, add some text and href to it and bind it to some click function
[20:05:38] <iLogic> otherwise I have to do it just with string text and change selectors
[20:06:30] <coldhead> var a = $('<a />', { href: 'something'}).text('some text'); $a.appendTo('#something');
[20:06:40] <coldhead> that's how i do that kind of thing
[20:06:43] <coldhead> var $a rather
[20:06:47] <iLogic> that would go like $('<a />').attr('href','#').text('Click here').click(function() { already binding to some function {);
[20:07:01] <bontaq> sisb: you were correct about the extra <p>s, thank you tremendously c:
[20:07:17] <sisb> np
[20:07:19] <iLogic> that looks even better i'll try it..
[20:07:42] <sisb> iLogic chaining
[20:07:50] <iLogic> but, the chaining.. yeah
[20:08:10] <iLogic> I wanted to already bind the clicking function
[20:08:21] <sisb> .x.y == chaining,  .x(function(){ y() }) is callback
[20:08:41] <coldhead> you maybe want to use on() to bind to <a>s not yet in the page?
[20:08:53] <ML74> coldhead: fixed it!
[20:08:54] <iLogic> but it's supposed to work
[20:09:10] <ML74> coldhead: any idea how i get a value from a date time input? just .val() ?
[20:09:12] <iLogic> i'm trying to implement this: http://jsfiddle.net/niklasvh/nTv7D/
[20:09:27] <coldhead> val() should do it, ML74
[20:09:41] <iLogic> so i thought it might be the version i'm using
[20:11:24] <coldhead> i am not sure this isn't working, iLogic
[20:11:30] <coldhead> i click see more and i see more
[20:11:51] <coldhead> i am not finding this code very readable but that might just be me
[20:11:53] <iLogic> coldhead: the example is, but not when i try it on my code..
[20:12:02] <iLogic> it's not mine
[20:14:18] <iLogic> i'm trying to just insert the tag (without the click) and it doesn't work: jq('<a />').attr('href','#').text('Show more');
[20:15:27] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/nTv7D/185/ ?
[20:16:30] <iLogic> yeah, but it doesn't work on mine.. so I wonder about the version
[20:17:04] <iLogic> but i don't know how to look for it, how to call this method..
[20:17:17] <arielserafini> iLogic: are you trying to add an <a> to the page?
[20:17:37] <iLogic> arielserafini: plus change its attribute, text and bind a click function
[20:18:13] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/nTv7D/186/
[20:18:27] <arielserafini> i'd use var newLink = document.createElement("a");
[20:18:36] <coldhead> iLogic: you can try running the $('<a />') line at the console in your debugger
[20:18:42] <coldhead> and see if it returns something sensible
[20:18:55] <arielserafini> and then use jQuery(newLink).click()
[20:18:57] <iLogic> I got it working like this
[20:18:58] <coldhead> arielserafini: that's not the jQuery way
[20:19:07] <iLogic> but it's not very elegant and it's for a test
[20:19:52] <arielserafini> coldhead: it's all javascript, isn't it?
[20:19:53] <arielserafini> :)
[20:20:11] <iLogic> well, nevermind.. i'll just leave it unelegant :(
[20:20:20] <iLogic> thanks anyway guys
[20:20:49] <coldhead> oh no quibble on it all being JS, it's just that every time you call createElement directly a part of you dies inside
[20:21:04] <coldhead> you only get to call that method so many times in your life
[20:21:08] <coldhead> don't want to waste them
[20:21:10] <arielserafini> lol
[20:21:36] <ML74> coldhead: got that. but now it seems to be taking an hour off the time that i enter. any ideas?
[20:22:46] <arielserafini> iLogic: have you tried using $("<a>") ?
[20:22:52] <arielserafini> instead of <a />
[20:23:18] <jrockjiggz_l> in chrome, anyone remember how to search 'all sources' ?
[20:24:06] <coldhead> no clue, ML74, that sounds very weird and disturbing
[20:27:45] <jrockjiggz_l> .. I have this alert that pops up. i cannot find in the source where its coming from... i've search all files, and in chrome I cannot find the string
[20:28:06] <__machine> im using html5 elements and modernizr/html5shiv ... when i use jquery to .show() elements that have display: none, they remain unstyled... do i need to do something with jquery.live() or something to make this work in IE8?
[20:29:08] <ML74> coldhead: seems that i should be using datetime-local :/
[20:32:47] <devians> Hey, is there a way of doing 'find' but stopping at the highest part in the dom that matches? kind of like a children that stops recursing down on first match?
[20:32:53] <jrockjiggz_l> if I load ajax into an element.. and this data contains javascript, which binds to some elements.. if I replace the html in this element, shouldn't the jquery binding be removed?
[20:33:35] <devians> ie ul#top > li.1 > ul > li.2, $('ul#top').find('li', justthefirst) returning li.1
[20:33:36] <jrockjiggz_l> devians: you can use the > operator (from css, indicated direct children)
[20:33:48] <jrockjiggz_l> ohh
[20:35:00] <devians> kind of like a reverse closest
[20:36:07] <devians> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7051897/how-can-i-select-the-shallowest-matching-descendant seems to be it
[20:36:58] <jrockjiggz_l> i was thinking of telling you to find('url:first > li','#top')
[20:37:04] <jrockjiggz_l> *ul
[20:43:56] <tjz> Hello guys
[20:44:16] <tjz> may i know what jquery plugin do you use to make big dropdown menu??
[20:44:31] <skcin7> Anybody have any idea why this code to send a file to the server using $.ajax isn't working properly?
[20:44:34] <skcin7> http://pastebin.com/xZYQMUSE
[20:48:46] <beachandbytes> tjz i used  a modified version of jquery ui combobox
[20:49:03] <gnarf> devians: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12452921/91914
[20:49:21] <gnarf> devians: same approach, just more readable
[20:50:48] <Forbidd3n> Is there any jquery plugins to populate multiple drop downs based on selection in a tier?
[20:51:26] <Forbidd3n> Select 1, Select 2, Select 3 - if select one changes then it populates select 2 with data via ajax and resets all others
[20:53:15] <gnarf> Forbidd3n: not that I'm aware of, but it wouldn't take more than 10 minutes to write that
[20:54:07] <gnarf> I'm sure >someone< has tried to pluginize it, but I would suggest just rolling it yourself
[20:54:08] <Forbidd3n> gnarf: yeah I have one written I was just curious if there was a prototype or function already created
[20:54:50] <gnarf> Forbidd3n: you could be the guy to release that plugin ;)
[20:55:51] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to create it where it would do infinite number of selects based on parent and child id
[20:56:02] <Forbidd3n> using rel="childId"
[20:56:14] <Forbidd3n> the challenge is to clear the tree
[20:57:15] <Forbidd3n> I am thinking I can loop through all trees or should I create something like this $('#child1,#child2,#child3').clearSelects();
[20:57:59] <gnarf> Forbidd3n: if you could paste the code that you have, add some comments etc, I could probably give better recommendations
[20:58:19] <gnarf> make a jsbin ?
[20:58:43] <Forbidd3n> jsbin?
[20:58:48] <jrockjiggz_l> ?demo
[20:58:48] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[20:58:49] <Forbidd3n> goooogling.
[20:58:54] <gnarf> http://jsbin.com/
[20:59:00] <Forbidd3n> oh paste on jsbin
[20:59:06] <Forbidd3n> sorry I use jsfiddle
[20:59:11] <gnarf> that works too
[20:59:28] <gnarf> i've been starting to switch to jsbin little by little
[20:59:43] <jrockjiggz_l> could never used jsbin.. it feels annoying
[21:00:03] <jrockjiggz_l> can't really see the code in action
[21:00:19] <gnarf> jrockjiggz_l: the newer changes are improving it greatly
[21:12:47] <coldhead> let's get all drunk in this club
[21:13:25] <skcin7> *raises glass*
[21:14:14] <tw2113> *ducks* i'm back
[21:14:19] <tw2113> *raises water*
[21:19:27] <Forbidd3n> gnarf: idea on simple way to recursive remove all options from multiple dropdowns based on rel on parent equals to id on child
[21:19:59] <Forbidd3n> <select id="p" rel="c1"> <select id="c1" rel="c2"> <select id="c2" rel="c3">
[21:20:49] <Forbidd3n> I tried -- while($(child).attr('rel')){ child = $(this).attr('rel'); }
[21:20:53] <Forbidd3n> freezes up though
[21:20:57] <Forbidd3n> infinite loop
[21:23:34] <gnarf> try recursive instead of while loop
[21:23:39] <gnarf> prolly writes easier
[21:23:54] <gnarf> like have select1 call the "updateFunction" on its target
[21:23:57] <gnarf> and it calls its
[21:23:58] <gnarf> etc
[21:24:49] <Forbidd3n> I got it
[21:35:43] <Forbidd3n> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/pzmMU/1/
[21:35:58] <Forbidd3n> the json doesn't work due to the url not being accessible
[21:36:16] <Forbidd3n> but what do you think of the resetting of infinite children
[21:40:39] <SomeoneWeird> Anyway I can set the height of a textarea to the same height of the text inside it?
[21:42:02] <coldhead> SomeoneWeird: was helping someone debug this last week http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/textarea-expander/index.html
[21:43:03] <SomeoneWeird> ooo nice, thanks
[21:43:10] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: how does the resetting function that I created look to you?
[21:43:17] <Forbidd3n> if you don't mind taking a peek
[21:43:23] <SomeoneWeird> except the link from that site 404's
[21:44:18] <SomeoneWeird> nvm got it
[21:44:23] <_zoggy_> Google announced last summer that support for out of date browsers would cease as newer versions were introduced. The time has come for Internet Explorer 8 to wave a fond farewell with the rollout of Internet Explorer 10 next month. This is also another nail in the XP coffin as support begins to get thinner by the month.
[21:44:49] <coldhead> http://www.stevefenton.co.uk/Content/Jquery-Textarea-Expander/
[21:44:56] <SomeoneWeird> yeah
[21:45:56] <coldhead> looks okay to me Forbidd3n but this kind of trickyness is more up gnarf's alley
[21:46:01] <coldhead> i mostly just do one liners
[21:47:02] <Forbidd3n> one liners?
[21:47:34] <Forbidd3n> I have multiple drops in multi area so I tried to create a prototype for it so I don't have to write it over and over again
[21:48:11] <SomeoneWeird> hmm it doesn't seem to work coldhead, I'm setting the contents with .val()
[21:48:14] <coldhead> one-liners of jQ, Forbidd3n
[21:48:33] <coldhead> SomeoneWeird: i would expect that to work if you set the val first, then applied the plugin
[21:48:45] <coldhead> otherwise maybe try $('textarea').trigger('change')
[21:48:51] <coldhead> which is what it might be bound to
[21:49:33] <SomeoneWeird> hmm
[21:50:13] <SomeoneWeird> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3179385/val-doesnt-trigger-change-in-jquery
[21:50:13] <SomeoneWeird> ah
[21:50:22] <SomeoneWeird> yeah
[21:51:30] <SomeoneWeird> mmm still no worky
[21:52:57] <coldhead> $('textarea').trigger('keyup')
[21:53:08] <coldhead> i just read that's what it's using in the sauce
[21:54:38] <SomeoneWeird> cheers man
[21:54:40] <SomeoneWeird> :D
[22:17:55] <Flikker> Is there an easy way to make a button keep it's active state without a cartload of code? (I can add ui-state-active to the class but as soon as I mouse over and out of the button the active state gets removed)
[22:28:23] <slick-> tc
[22:28:40] <slick-> hello, does anyone know an alternative to e.offsetY in firefox
[22:28:46] <slick-> works fine in safari, ie, chrome
[22:38:46] <coldhead> Flikker: i would try a lazy $('.element').mouseout(function () { $(this).addClass('that-ui-class'); });
[22:38:50] <coldhead> to re-add it
[22:39:23] <Flikker> coldhead: Works well enough. Lazy is good. :)
[22:56:24] <oGMinor> How do I sanitize something in jquery after I append it to a css element? IE I want to $('#chatbox').append("<b>" + user + "</b> " + message ); I cant figure out how to a sanitize just message with the .text() function
[22:57:10] <mansoor-s> oGMinor, .text() does sanitize it
[22:57:17] <mansoor-s> use .html() for unsanitized
[22:57:37] <oGMinor> what would I use, I dont want it unsanitized
[22:57:39] <Lucky--> hm in js can I do var hi = "nameOfSomeFunc"; var myRes = hi();?
[22:57:45] <oGMinor> as is, it prints out code
[23:02:10] <tw2113> var hi = function() { return "nameOfSomeFunc"; }
[23:03:44] <tw2113> the way you do it returns "hi is not a function" errors
[23:10:28] <iDope> Hi, what would be the best method to make an XHR using jQuery and do something when the request is completed (error or normal response)
[23:11:07] <iDope> I am using $.get but can't seem to find any documentation on how to use a callback on completion using $.get
[23:11:55] <jrockjiggz> $.get(url, function(){ alert('i did something after the load'); });
[23:12:38] <iDope> so second argument is completion callback? Thanks jrockjiggz
[23:13:15] <jrockjiggz> iDope: i should correct, get isnt an ajax
[23:13:19] <jrockjiggz> use load()
[23:13:40] <jrockjiggz> i guess get works too
[23:13:43] <jrockjiggz> tias
[23:14:17] <jrockjiggz> get(), load(), are both shortcuts for $.ajax()... best to use $.ajax() for the most control
[23:14:50] <coldhead> or get() and load() for most readability!
[23:22:52] <disappearedng> Hey can someone tell me why I can't see all my cookies at document.cookie?
[23:23:09] <mansoor-s> disappearedng, i eat the cookies
[23:23:31] <mansoor-s> also, most likely because they aren't from the same domain
[23:23:38] <mansoor-s> +sub domain
[23:24:39] <disappearedng> A user visits site a.com, a.com uses an analytics from b.com and they make a analytics JS call to b.com after the page has loaded. If the javascript in b.com calls console.log(document.cookie), how come that shows a.com's cookie as opposed to b.com?
[23:26:11] <coldhead> http://laughingsquid.com/cookie-monster-no-want-to-delete-cookies/
[23:28:14] <disappearedng> Actually if I make a call to b.com with $.ajax, how can I get the cookie provided by b.com at the server end with jquery?
[23:31:28] <coldhead> i wouldn't expect you to be able to make the call to b.com, with or without cookies
[23:34:58] <rgr> marnin. So, which of the different browsers has the most powerfl/useful debugger? I kind of like the look of the opera one in how it deals with visual feedback and spacings. Any recommendations or are they all much of a muchness?
[23:35:20] <SomeoneWeird> chrome debugger is awesome
[23:35:38] <rgr> can you say why its more "awesome" than the others?
[23:35:53] <tw2113> as much crap that i fling at chrome, all of the debugging tools in firefox/chrome/opera are awesome
[23:36:32] <rgr> Yeah, they're all awesome, I was jus wondering if someone had recommendations of why one might be more useful and why.
[23:36:41] <disappearedng>     crossDomain: true, dataType: 'jsonp',  // Acesss-Control-Allow-Origin
[23:36:50] <disappearedng> coldhead: that's the thing I am passing in for jsonp
[23:37:06] <Woet> rgr: why not just try them yourself?
[23:37:08] <tw2113> i like that firefox aurora has a built in js prettifier now
[23:37:46] <rgr> Woet: and why not ask experienced users their opinion? I do use them myself : but I'm not fully au fait with what may or may not be better for advanced debugging.
[23:38:02] <Woet> rgr: because it's mainly a matter of personal opinion.
[23:38:10] <rgr> ok, then dont offer one.
[23:38:33] <rgr> and not its not : its a tool. And some tools have better facilites for, exampe, DOM syntax error debugging.
[23:39:19] <rgr> e.g I can honsetly advise a newer user to use opera if they have spacing issue - their rendering of padding etc is excellent.
[23:39:35] <coldhead> disappearedng: JSONP is just a hack to do cross domain ajax, and i still don't think it lets you do cookies cross domain. you COULD maybe get the remote site to send the cookies back in the JSONP data
[23:39:40] <coldhead> that would be legit
[23:40:00] <disappearedng> coldhead: ah so it's still sketchy right now
[23:40:32] <disappearedng> is that what analytics do? I mean like how do I push to Google analycis?
[23:41:34] <coldhead> it's sketchy in that it's a workaround for a security issue
[23:41:36] <coldhead> but it works
[23:45:19] <rgr> coldhead: I realise this is a litle vague and you wont have much to go on, but maybe youve seen something like the following before. Its a litle system Im writing myself and there is a grey toolbar. Its z-index is 3. The sports events you see are all z-index:1. Note how the botom of the toolbar is transparent but the top part isnt. Its all one div. Its driving me nuts. I inspected the dom and the real madrid item and the liverpool item
[23:45:19] <rgr> are at the same "level" with the same z-index. http://imgur.com/Mmdl
[23:46:34] <coldhead> z-indexes are a mystery i don't think anyone understands fully
[23:47:04] <coldhead> significant factors you may have overlooked: order of elements in the page makes a difference
[23:47:13] <coldhead> z-indexes of parents makes a difference
[23:49:04] <rgr> in this case they are rendered left to right top to bottom. but your reference to the parent is interesting. let me check something.,
[23:51:48] <rgr> well fairplay coldhead : I fixed it... so I dont understand z-index .... well I do but its funny. All the sports items where 1, but the absolutely positioned child (toolbar) seems to forget that its got a higher one when its rendered on its parents sibling ... I changed the z-index of the items back to 0 and  ... worked....
[23:53:15] <tw2113> elements need some explicitly stated position to work
[23:53:42] <tw2113> eg static, relative, absolute, fixed, inherit
[23:54:54] <rgr> define "work". It doesnt have to be explicitly stated at all.
[23:55:45] <tw2113> last i checked, a position property needed to be there, maybe not
[23:55:50] <tw2113> if i'm wrong, i'm wrong
[23:56:19] <TimTim`> i believe z-indexing requires the element to be either position:absolute or relative
[23:56:25] <rgr> you are wrong afaik. It would kind of defeat the purpose of css if you needed to explcitly state it.
[23:56:26] <TimTim`> or fixed
[23:56:48] <TimTim`> elements are position:static by default, i believe
[23:56:49] <rgr> TimTim`: that could be it.
[23:56:54] <tw2113> ^
[23:57:11] <TimTim`> inherit would work if the parent element was position:relative|absolute|fixed
[23:57:18] <rgr> it "kind of worked". ie worked on z order of immediate parent when absolute but not on parents sibling. all good now.
[23:57:39] <TimTim`> so basically, z-index doesn't "work" if it's position:static
[23:58:05] <TimTim`> yeah IE is weird about z-indexing
[23:58:09] <TimTim`> imagine that
[23:58:18] <rgr> or works wierdly with position absolute on a parent of relative..
[23:58:39] <TimTim`> i've gotten into the habit of just setting all elements to position:relative by default lol
[23:59:07] <rgr> yeah well, for thigns like pop up toolbars absolute tends to be useful ;)
[23:59:10] <ravenzz> that's silly
[23:59:28] <TimTim`> rgr, keyword: default
[23:59:37] <TimTim`> of course it can be overridden and made absolute when needed
[23:59:55] <rgr> of course, no one would sugest otherwise since thats what we do ;)
