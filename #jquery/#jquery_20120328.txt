[00:05:47] <juho3> I have a question not directly related to jQuery most likely but I'll ask here anyway. I have a page where a user can drag and drop small pictures onto a bigger div. Is it possible to somehow render the contents of that div into an image file and let the user download that image and maybe even save it on to the server?
[00:06:51] <Cork> juho3: no, it would tecnically be posible through canvas, but its blocked in browser cause of security problems
[00:07:22] <juho3> interesting.
[00:07:33] <juho3> interesting. so no way at all?
[00:07:40] <Cork> no
[00:11:03] <Eviltwin> juho3: There are lots of things that be nice to be able to do but are forbidden because they could also be used for bad purposes as well
[00:11:13] <juho3> mmhm
[00:11:30] <conancat> there is nodejs and node-canvas
[00:11:45] <conancat> that you can render canvas on the server side, output it as a buffer/file then send it back to the client
[00:12:16] <conancat> or if you can play with cairo and stuff, the server side image rendering thing
[00:12:44] <conancat> i think quickmeme or memegenerator uses some of those libraries to create images
[00:13:20] <juho3> okay
[00:27:44] <shadykhan> anyone here for some help?
[00:35:27] <Whirl3d> good evenin' all. What does it mean when this image loading plugin says: "you can bind the 'error' event on data uri images, this will trigger even when data uri images isn't supported?
[00:35:48] <Whirl3d> https://github.com/peol/jquery.imgloaded/blob/master/ahpi.imgload.js
[00:36:56] <Whirl3d> What are data uri images?
[00:39:58] <Andres75> Yo people looking for jQuery expert for a job (payed) it's difficult though
[00:40:24] <shadykhan> Andres75, also look at #freelance
[00:41:01] <Andres75> ok... erm I am a bit noob when it comes to IRC, do I just join that channel?
[00:41:36] <shadykhan> type /join #freelance
[00:41:43] <Andres75> cheers
[00:42:38] <Whirl3d> anybody know what the term "data uri image" means?
[00:43:19] <shadykhan> Whirl3d, http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/
[00:44:13] <Whirl3d> wow. Thanks for the link.
[00:57:19] <Whirl3d> how do I write a selector to only select elements with data attributes, "foo" or "bar"?   $("['data.foo']
[00:58:30] <Whirl3d> |"['data.bar']");    sorry fat fingered the enter key
[00:59:45] <mzilla> so I am using .live() to bind events to elements that are appended to the body at a later time but the documentation states that .live() is deprecated and I should use .on() , but when I use on() the events don't bind to new elements. Am I missing something?
[01:00:12] <Whirl3d> you don't bind to new elements.
[01:00:19] <j9058> how do i construct a jquery collection? http://jsfiddle.net/5YfjL/
[01:00:25] <Whirl3d> you bind on to their common parent or ancestor
[01:00:50] <Whirl3d> then the event bubbles up to the parent or ancestor and it's handled by one function, not lots of new functions
[01:01:31] <mzilla> Whirl3d: ah I think I got it so I bind to body like: $('body).on('click', '.items', {}, function(){});
[01:01:46] <Whirl3d> perfect
[01:01:56] <mzilla> Whirl3d: thx for clearing that up :) cheers!
[01:01:59] <xec> near perfect, missing a ' ;D
[01:02:00] <Whirl3d> np
[01:02:07] <mzilla> xec: sorry ;)
[01:02:07] <Whirl3d> lol
[01:05:38] <improwizacja> hello
[01:06:33] <improwizacja> How to select this in jquery 'nav ul.menu li:hover div.focus'
[01:07:28] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/TdUTs/ - why do I get "Shell form does not validate" ?
[01:07:30] <improwizacja> or something beter how to delete this form css
[01:07:32] <j9058> updated: how can i add elements to a new jquery object? http://jsfiddle.net/5YfjL/4/
[01:08:32] <Whirl3d> j9058, you might want to look at .map
[01:16:08] <Robbington> Anyone know why Crome wont let me mimic a click event?
[01:16:20] <Robbington> Really struggling to find a solution here
[01:17:21] <Whirl3d> Robbington, seriously? That's ridiculous, chrome isn't prohibiting you from triggering a click event. What are you trying to do? Give us some context at least.
[01:17:58] <Eviltwin> Robbington: No browsers I'm aware of allow you to reliably simulate events
[01:18:21] <Eviltwin> jQuery allows you to simulate jQuery events
[01:18:28] <Robbington> All the other browsers allow element.click()
[01:18:56] <Robbington> Crome doesnt, it isnt returning a error. It just doesnt work.
[01:19:40] <mattyh88> does a function exist to parse a double?
[01:19:45] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:element.click
[01:19:47] <Robbington> Well I have a plug in that binds click events to images, I have a hover over element. So I have jsut just jquery to fire the click event on the element underneath the hover
[01:19:50] <Eviltwin> mattyh88: parseFloat
[01:20:05] <mattyh88> ahh parseFloat yes :D
[01:20:06] <mattyh88> thx :D
[01:23:31] <Robbington> Eviltwin: I know, it should be that simple. Thats what I have in my code. the click event is fired on the hover, but it doesnt trigger the click on the image beneath.
[01:23:40] <Robbington> Its driving me nuts
[01:24:24] <Eviltwin> Perhaps you're not properly selecting the image beneath
[01:24:36] <shadykhan> hey guys i need some help
[01:24:42] <shadykhan> http://www.imadkhan.me/new/
[01:24:50] <shadykhan> if you click on one of the first two items in the portfolio
[01:24:55] <shadykhan> it will ajax in some content
[01:25:03] <shadykhan> how can i make it so the browser will scroll down to that content?
[01:25:44] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: Snap down or animate slide down?
[01:26:00] <shadykhan> Eviltwin, slidedown
[01:26:16] <Eviltwin> $("html, body").animate({scrollTop: $("#content").offset().top});
[01:26:18] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/TdUTs/ - why do I get "Shell form does not validate" ?
[01:26:45] <Robbington> EvilTwin: I have console.log() out the element and it finds it fine. This wouldnt explain why it only doesnt work in crome
[01:26:53] <Robbington> the only thing to go on os event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
[01:27:00] <Eviltwin> nisseni: Here's a step in the right direction: http://jsfiddle.net/TdUTs/1/
[01:27:14] <shadykhan> thx Eviltwin ill try it out
[01:27:39] <nisseni> Eviltwin: still shell form does not validate
[01:28:13] <Robbington> Id say that was the problem, but if you delete the hove over element and click the image it works fine. So its something to do with Crome and element.click
[01:30:19] <Whirl3d> Robbington, why don't you create a fiddle that reproduces this error. It'll make it easier (possible, even) to help[
[01:30:21] <Eviltwin> nisseni: I still have no idea what you mean by that
[01:30:46] <nisseni> Eviltwin: did you try to click the actual button that appears when running the script?
[01:31:43] <Eviltwin> I think you were missing a line: http://jsfiddle.net/TdUTs/2/
[01:37:02] <nisseni> Eviltwin: still the same error when clicking the button :)
[01:37:22] <Eviltwin> nisseni: Are you translating the error?
[01:37:28] <Eviltwin> Because what you're saying makes no sense
[01:37:57] <nisseni> Eviltwin: in the jsfiddle, as you click the button, don't you get an error?
[01:38:23] <Robbington> Prob is that there is a lot to it, the plug in alone is thosands of lines of js.
[01:38:37] <shadykhan> Eviltwin, how would i do the same effect but go to the top of the page? i replace #content with #top but it didnt work
[01:38:38] <shadykhan> $("html, body").animate({scrollTop: $("#content").offset().top});
[01:38:40] <shadykhan> thats the code you gave me
[01:39:03] <Robbington> Maybe if someone could tell me how to log out the bound event then I can follow the chain in the plug in and see if I can attach the same event to the hover of el on page load
[01:40:38] <Eviltwin> How to log out the bound event?
[01:40:42] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[01:40:55] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: scrollTop: 0 instead
[01:41:59] <shadykhan> Eviltwin, $('a.top').click(function(){$("html, body").animate({scrollTop: 0});});
[01:42:01] <shadykhan> like that?
[01:42:20] <Eviltwin> nisseni: see ?$.post
[01:42:21] <bot-t> nisseni, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:44:18] <Robbington> Well the image has a click event bound to it, if I can bind the same click event to the hover element then I dont need to mimic the click event anymore
[01:44:35] <Eviltwin> You mean it has a click listener bound to it
[01:44:52] <Eviltwin> How did you bind the click event in the first place?
[01:45:35] <nisseni> Eviltwin: really, you don't get the error message?
[01:46:28] <shadykhan> Eviltwin, i did that but its snapping to the top
[01:46:53] <Robbington> The click event is bound by a plug in, Content flow.
[01:47:50] <Robbington> Here is the plug in js
[01:47:50] <Robbington> http://pastebin.com/2mpZY7T4
[01:47:55] <Robbington> But there is a lot to it.
[01:51:55] <xec> holy mother of pastes
[01:54:19] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ Robbington
[01:54:19] <bot-t> Robbington, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[01:55:33] <xec> s/hundreds/thousands
[01:55:49] <overbythere> over 9,000?
[01:56:23] <xec> 2673 is not "hundreds"

[01:58:16] <overbythere> oh okay

[02:10:48] <AdvoWork> I have a table, with id cutter_table which is set as display:none; and im trying to add that table to a div(so its inside). I'm doing: $('#order_line_detail_div').append($('#cutter_table').html()); it shows; but it doesnt go inside the div?
[02:12:44] <antgel> hi all.  i have an image (flag) in my html that can be toggled when it's clicked on (the src attribute).  i need to store the state of this so that the event handler knows whether to toggle it to white or red
[02:13:23] <haizum> anyone know a good plugin to scroll text scross the screen?
[02:13:31] <haizum> i.e. from a text file
[02:13:35] <antgel> i can see a few ways of doing this - using jquery data to store the state, or adding a css class (whiteflag or redflag).  the event handler will act based on either.  what is considered "better" and why?
[02:13:43] <antgel> please let me know if this isn't clear
[02:14:35] <AdvoWork> can you somehow bind an event for when something ends up in the dom? ive realised my append isnt working as the div isnt yet created :S
[02:14:42] <nisseni> Eviltwin: you simply don't know or?
[02:15:23] <poppiez> I'm creating a JS lib that depends on jquery, backbone and underscore. this lib is to be included on other websites. what kind of approach would you recommend? create a single file with all the JS and risk the website already has those libs included or tell the website to include them themselves and then have them update the libs when needed?
[02:16:21] <Robbington> Ok, sorry about that. I have found where the click event is bound. Can anyone tell me how I would get the previuos sibling in just js?
[02:16:35] <Eviltwin> nisseni: see ?$.post
[02:16:38] <bot-t> nisseni, jQuery.post() - Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[02:16:44] <Eviltwin> See what you're doing differently
[02:17:00] <Eviltwin> Robbington: .prevSibling
[02:17:20] <Eviltwin> Sorry, previousSibling
[02:17:27] <Eviltwin> Forgot just how verbose W3C was
[02:18:47] <Robbington> Tried that, I get <TextNode textContent=" ">
[02:19:42] <nisseni> Eviltwin: first off, I'm doing exactly that, secondly, the error message when clicking the button still remains
[02:19:56] <Robbington> this[this._activeElement].previousSibling; Where this[this._activeElement] = <img src="" />
[02:22:43] <antgel> AdvoWork: this is covered in the docs.  http://api.jquery.com/on/ - delegated events
[02:22:56] * antgel just helped here for the first time
[02:23:06] <jovrtn> yay!
[02:23:19] <antgel> hi all.  i have an image (flag) in my html that can be toggled when it's clicked on (the src attribute).  i need to store the state of this so that the event handler knows whether to toggle it to white or red.  i can see a few ways of doing this - using jquery data to store the state, or adding a css class (whiteflag or redflag).  the event handler will act based on either.  what is considered "better" and why?
[02:26:14] <AdvoWork> antdillon, but what if i don't want it to be a click event, so on (once its loaded, append into it?)
[02:29:03] <Eviltwin> nisseni: First off, you're not doing exactly that
[02:29:45] <Eviltwin> Robbington: That's the whitespace between the previous sibling and that element
[02:30:01] <Eviltwin> Do another .previousSibling or make a loop until you find the element you're looking for
[02:30:12] <Eviltwin> This is all stuff jQuery takes care of for you
[02:31:08] <Eviltwin> Robbington: In some cases it can actually be quite frustrating that jQuery is so strongly attached to elements instead of nodes
[02:31:26] <Eviltwin> Namely when you're trying to interact with text nodes or HTML comments etc directly
[02:35:09] <Eviltwin> nisseni: Your problem is that you're doing $("...").post instead of $.post
[02:35:18] <Eviltwin> nisseni: Those mean different things
[02:35:25] <nisseni> Eviltwin: got it working
[02:35:33] <nisseni> but the error message in jsfiddle still remains
[02:35:41] <nisseni> and that's what I'm curious abou
[02:35:43] <nisseni> t
[02:47:24] <lajdr> I have a list of search result items and I'd like to reveal some controls when you hover over a particular item.
[02:47:56] <lajdr> I have hooked up the hover and reveal and that works...
[02:48:18] <lajdr> Each of my search items is a div with a class and the controls are in a div inside that one
[02:48:45] <lajdr> when i apply the effects it applies them to all of the search item controls because i am matching on 'class'
[02:49:16] <lajdr> I have tried using closest and child but with no success.
[02:49:39] <lajdr> Should I programatically give each item a unique id and match on that instead or can i find the matching controls using JQuery?
[02:49:54] <overbythere> lajdr: whats your hover code?
[02:49:59] <Antonio_> you can select the parent item
[02:51:13] <Antonio_> in pseudocode that would be this.parent.controls
[02:51:43] <lajdr> so the relationship isn't child or parent due to the way its structured
[02:51:50] <Antonio_> http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[02:52:07] <Antonio_> yes but you go up one item
[02:52:38] <Antonio_> till you get to the box which contains both your seearch and the corresp. controls
[02:53:11] <lajdr> ah, i see
[02:53:20] <Antonio_> search result => main container of this result => toolbox of this result
[02:53:33] <lajdr> that makes sense
[02:54:12] <Antonio_> you might have to trial and error quite a bit
[02:54:16] <lajdr> for future reference, in these types of scenarios should i always try and do the manipulation using JQuery or should I uniquely name ids etc?
[02:54:34] <Antonio_> maybe set up a basic html page to try out the parent function
[02:54:53] <Antonio_> hmm
[02:55:39] <Antonio_> IMO it's best not to have loads of unique ID's, al long as you can work with relations
[02:55:56] <DukeDrake> hi
[02:56:24] <Antonio_> only if you have, lets say, two different results in ONE box and you want to display two different toolsets for those
[02:56:50] <lajdr> Thank you
[02:56:54] <Antonio_> np
[03:08:53] <AdvoWork> can .on() be used, but not for say a click event etc?
[03:09:07] <AdvoWork> ie i just want to know when a div has been loaded into the dom, so i can append to it
[03:09:29] <quicksilver> that's not how .on works
[03:09:34] <xinming_> In jquery, How do we get the nodeName for a jquery wrapped element please?
[03:09:52] <quicksilver> there is no portable way to trigger on DOM changes like new divs being added.
[03:10:26] <quicksilver> xinming_: $(blah)[0].nodeNam
[03:11:01] <recentlydeceased> just curious, what is the difference between defining a function like so -- function foo() {} -- or like this -- foo = function() {}
[03:11:10] <recentlydeceased> I have inherited a file that has the latter and I can't call foo from a separate script. foo is defined in the document ready of one file, and I'm trying to call it from a function in the other script long after page load.  Does the script load order affect whether one script has access to the others functions?
[03:11:47] <quicksilver> xinming_: or $(blah).prop('nodeName')
[03:12:04] <quicksilver> recentlydeceased: script load order is not important, although obviously you can't actually call things before they are defined.
[03:12:14] <quicksilver> recentlydeceased: what matters is what scope the variable is in.
[03:12:29] <xinming_> quicksilver: hmm, Well, I'll change my question. In jquery-ui, We get a ui arg in callback, Do we get the nodeName from the 'ui' arg with ui.prop('nodeName')?
[03:12:52] <recentlydeceased> quicksilver, hmm, this is global scope no? ... addressSelectChange = function() {}
[03:12:54] <quicksilver> recentlydeceased: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[03:13:11] <quicksilver> recentlydeceased: not necessarily. Depends where 'addressSelectChange' was declared, if at all.
[03:13:27] <Xotix> recentlydeceased: read http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/ check if it  isn't a proeprty of something. then u would have to call it like obj.foo
[03:13:27] <quicksilver> xinming_: did you try it? what happened?
[03:13:30] <recentlydeceased> quicksilver, ahh, ok thanks
[03:13:55] <recentlydeceased> Xotix, again ty, I will follow this up!
[03:14:11] <xinming_> quicksilver: Not yet. I'll try it now
[03:15:35] <recentlydeceased> just fyi, this is the error I get when calling addressSelectChange(); -- addressSelectChange is not defined
[03:15:43] <xinming_> quicksilver: thanks, Well, the reason I ask is, Since you gave the answer which is $(blah)[0].nodeName, Which made me curious is everything an array?
[03:15:57] <quicksilver> xinming_: well, not *everything*
[03:16:05] <quicksilver> xinming_: but jQuery objects are arrays, yes.
[03:16:11] <recentlydeceased> also, is there a difference between function foo() {} and foo = function() {} ?
[03:16:25] <quicksilver> recentlydeceased: see the link I pasted.
[03:16:40] <quicksilver> yes, but it's subtle and not subject to a 1-line explanation.
[03:16:45] <recentlydeceased> quicksilver, ok, just fired it up!
[03:17:06] <recentlydeceased> quicksilver, thanks again man
[03:17:49] <xinming_> quicksilver: Where is the DOM element stored then?
[03:18:00] <quicksilver> xinming_: what does that question mean?
[03:18:11] <quicksilver> xinming_: the DOM element is stored in your computer's memory...
[03:18:38] <xinming_> quicksilver: I mean how do we get the element which is like,  var element = document.getElementById('blabla');
[03:19:04] <quicksilver> xinming_: by using [0] as I showed.
[03:19:09] <quicksilver> or .get(0)
[03:19:16] <quicksilver> http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_pull_a_native_DOM_element_from_a_jQuery_object.3F
[03:19:21] <xinming_> quicksilver: Let's say, var element = document.getElementById('blabla'); var jqueryobj = $(element)
[03:19:24] <xinming_> Oh, thanks.
[03:19:29] <xinming_> That's what I mean.

[03:26:00] <VictorCL> I have this div hidden absolute positioned , I want to open it and show it like  windows messenger notification
[03:26:13] <VictorCL> I have this animate({'height':'100%'},400);   but is not working
[03:26:16] <VictorCL> is obiously wrong
[03:28:19] <Poetro> VictorCL: if it is hidden, it wont be visible
[03:28:38] <xec> VictorCL: i'm not sure you can animate percentages like that
[03:28:52] <mindis|wurk> is there some way of allowing all events to execute before a certain event is triggered? in my case i've made sort of custom radio buttons that change their appearance in one generic event and then there's some buttongroup specific events i'd like to trigger after the generic one has executed
[03:28:56] <VictorCL> $("#new_teacher_answer_popup").html(data).show().animate({'height':'+=10px'},600);
[03:28:58] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, i need to append a table based on its id, to a div, the problem is, the div hasn't yet been created. Any ideas?
[03:28:59] <xec> i could be wrong, as i never tried... but could you make a demo?
[03:29:39] <VictorCL> yes but how can I do it if is hidden
[03:29:54] <Poetro> VictorCL: first make it visible
[03:30:09] <Poetro> maybe set it's height to 0, overflow hidden
[03:30:21] <xec> ah, yes, percentages should work. do what Poetro said
[03:30:24] <Poetro> VictorCL: then add the animation
[03:31:21] <VictorCL> there yes , thanks
[03:31:22] <VictorCL> work great
[03:35:14] <granden> the $(window) is that the webbrowser window?
[03:35:39] <xec> granden: jquerified, yes
[03:36:04] <xec> granden: window is the root object
[03:37:12] <granden> So $(window).width() would give me the sze of the webbrowsers width?
[03:37:16] <granden> Thanks.
[03:37:32] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: yes. Do it after the div has been created!
[03:37:56] <quicksilver> mindis|wurk: you can trigger events (with .trigger()) - but why not just call functions?
[03:40:00] <mindis|wurk> quicksilver yeah i discovered bind already, thanks. i couldn't figure out a way to call the function in the right order
[03:43:02] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, its done after a callback though, which is repeated per row, so in theory it would do it 10 times if 10 rows?
[03:45:01] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: is it creating 10 different divs? then surely you want it to happen 10 times?
[03:54:59] <poppiez> hi, I'm creating a lib that uses jquery. I then create a single concatenated file with jquery and my files. this file is to be included on other websites so that they can use my lib. what if the website already has included jquery?
[03:56:54] <Andres75> as there is no one on the freelance channel I will ask here:
[03:57:08] <Andres75> is there anyone up for a payed jquery job?
[03:57:42] <Andres75> if not does anyone know where to recruit some freelance guru?
[04:06:02] <Cork> Andres75: you could always try #freelance
[04:06:59] <reve_> hi
[04:07:10] <reve_> can any one there to help me
[04:07:26] <Cork> ?ask
[04:07:27] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:07:32] <reve_> tnks
[04:07:47] <reve_> i use tablesorter plugin
[04:08:04] <reve_> i need to modify the cell dinamically every time
[04:08:13] <reve_> so i write a code :
[04:08:27] <poppiez> hi, I'm creating a lib that uses jquery. I then create a single concatenated file with jquery and my files. this file is to be included on other websites so that they can use my lib. what if the website already has included jquery?
[04:08:38] <reve_> var tr = document.getElementById('myTable').rows; var table = jQuery(".tablesorter"); table.tablesorter();
[04:08:54] <reve_> var tr = document.getElementById('myTable').rows;
[04:09:00] <reve_> var table = jQuery(".tablesorter");
[04:09:05] <reve_> table.tablesorter();
[04:09:07] <Cork> ?p @ reve_
[04:09:07] <bot-t> reve_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:09:12] <MacroMan> poppiez: You need to extend the jQuery functionality in a file in which you can distribute seperately
[04:09:20] <_helpPlz_> what is alternative to jsfiddle.net its not loading
[04:09:22] <_helpPlz_> ah thanks
[04:09:24] <reve_> ok tnks
[04:10:47] <MacroMan> poppiez: Check out some of the other libraries you can get like jQuery timers or jQuery UI and look at the source code to see how it's done.
[04:11:45] <Cork> poppiez: the best solution is to not mix jquery default with your plugin
[04:11:57] <reve_> http://fixee.org/paste/fkj61zh/
[04:12:03] <reve_> here is my code
[04:12:07] <Cork> poppiez: if the site wants to do it, they can do that them self
[04:12:14] <Cork> easily
[04:12:17] <reve_> can any one please help me to solve the bug
[04:14:55] <poppiez> Cork: but then I need each website to update jquery each time. my library is hosted on my domain and can change often
[04:17:07] <Cork> poppiez: so you mean they should load the plugin from your site?
[04:17:21] <Cork> do you have the capacity for that?
[04:17:53] <reve_> hi cork
[04:18:02] <reve_> did you get my code yet?
[04:18:16] <Cork> poppiez: and yes plugins shoulnd't ever be mixed with jquery on delivery, it should be up the the one that uses it
[04:18:26] <Cork> *shouldn't
[04:18:44] <Cork> reve_: yes, but i'm not sure what your trying to do
[04:18:57] <poppiez> Cork: yes, they should load a single file from my site that includes my own library and all of its dependencies. I have than enough capacity
[04:19:01] <reve_> i have a array of updated data
[04:19:16] <poppiez> more than enough*
[04:19:16] <reve_> and i compare with the data with table value
[04:19:23] <Cork> poppiez: and if they want to use another plugin from somewhere else?
[04:19:47] <reve_> if there is a inconsistency there then i update the table data with the array value
[04:19:55] <poppiez> Cork: it's not a plugin. it's a bunch of code to help them interact with our site (noone can replace that)
[04:20:30] <Cork> poppiez: but it still dictates what they can do with there site, as you force the package
[04:20:43] <marekw2143> do when I call $("#helooo").click(someFunction) and there's no any #helooo element, then jQuery's method "click" will not be fired ?
[04:20:48] <reve_> did you understand now ?
[04:21:07] <Cork> marekw2143: you need to use delegate see ?.on
[04:21:08] <bot-t> marekw2143, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:21:26] <poppiez> Cork: I don't have a solution on this yet. I'm merely trying to figure out the best way to do this. my code can change often to account for new stuff but I don't want each website to update the deps accordingly
[04:21:36] <poppiez> Cork: that's my issue. dunno if something like requireJS is ideal here
[04:21:43] <marekw2143> Cork: why should I use delegate?
[04:22:17] <Cork> marekw2143: cause you need to use a solution that doens't bind on the explicit element if it dosen't exist yet
[04:22:44] <Cork> marekw2143: if the selector doesn't match .click doens't do anything at all
[04:23:07] <marekw2143> Cork: ok
[04:23:09] <Cork> poppiez: you should have a solution that is as modular as posible, so you don't restrict what ppl can do
[04:23:35] <Cork> poppiez: you could offer a minimized and concated version if thats all they need
[04:23:36] <poppiez> Cork: why am I restricting ppl by having deps?
[04:23:45] <Cork> but its a bad idea to force it
[04:24:04] <Cork> poppiez: bundeling isn't the same as deps
[04:24:05] <poppiez> Cork: my code can't work without the deps
[04:24:14] <Cork> sure, so state that
[04:24:47] <poppiez> Cork: but I run into an issue where my code needs to use the latest jquery version because of new functionality but I can't push that update because it requires all websites to update accordingly
[04:24:52] <Cork> if every plugin would bundle the jquery lib you would have to load many copies on your webpage just to get the plugins
[04:25:24] <Cork> poppiez: and thats really why you should have stable api, and push releases
[04:25:40] <Cork> and let the site owner update ther page when they want to
[04:26:12] <poppiez> Cork: right, gotcha. my own code should be versioned then
[04:26:18] <Cork> yes
[04:26:28] <Cork> and separated from the jquery lib
[04:26:42] <poppiez> Cork: makes sense :)
[04:26:44] <poppiez> Cork: thx a lot
[04:26:49] <Cork> and then have documentated for my-lib-1.24.js you need jquery.x.js
[04:27:07] <poppiez> Cork: I like that  solution. thx for helping out
[04:27:12] <Cork> np
[04:31:12] <marekw2143> do when I add click handler with $("#someID").delegate("#childID", "click", handler), are there any assumptinos if handler will be called first?
[04:31:14] <reve_> cork
[04:31:24] <reve_> did you get my code now?
[04:31:36] <reve_> i add an example there: http://fixee.org/paste/fkj61zh/#url=6d9vktl
[04:31:45] <reve_> please take a look
[04:32:24] <Cork> reve_: haven't ever used tablesorter so...
[04:32:35] <Cork> reve_: what is it that fails?
[04:32:39] <marekw2143> can I remove all event handlers with .delegate J?
[04:33:05] <Cork> marekw2143: the handlers are called in the order they'r added
[04:33:08] <reve_> my code fail in $(tr[i].cells[l]).text(newData[k][l]);
[04:33:26] <marekw2143> Cork: may I then create some handler for event "ElementAdded"?
[04:33:27] <Cork> marekw2143: or rather the revers of, if i remember correctly
[04:33:36] <reve_> and this shows a output
[04:33:37] <reve_> TypeError: cell.parentNode is undefined
[04:33:39] <Cork> marekw2143: no
[04:33:57] <reve_> can you please help me
[04:34:02] <Cork> marekw2143: you would have to create a function and do the binding there
[04:34:13] <marekw2143> Cork: too much work for this task
[04:34:41] <Cork> reve_: i don't thinkg dom has a property cells
[04:34:48] <marekw2143> Cork: are handlers defined by .delegate call are fired before those defined in "onclick" attribute?
[04:35:09] <reve_> can you please tell me how can i fix this ?
[04:35:22] <Cork> marekw2143: ug... inline event handlers is a real mess and you should avoid them as long as posible
[04:35:25] <reve_> Because i need to update my table data
[04:35:37] <marekw2143> Cork: I know, but I'm making ASP.NET application ....
[04:36:37] <reve_> i tried in many way
[04:36:47] <reve_> but i cannot able to do this yet\
[04:38:10] <Cork> reve_: you could try http://fixee.org/paste/nqxs2cn
[04:38:36] <reve_> tnks a lot
[04:38:44] <reve_> i try this
[04:42:07] <pratz> hey guys I am using this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:42:47] <pratz> is there any way i can specify ajax that at response break this flow and go to some other url ?
[04:43:08] <Cork> window.location = new url
[04:43:28] <Cork> if thats what you mean
[04:47:36] <pratz> Cork: not exactly that
[04:47:54] <Xotix> i have foo.bar.com and test.bar.com. I'm opening test.bar.com in an iframe in foo.bar.com. Trying to postMessage() from the iframe to the parent page. How do i do that? How do i get the window obj of the parent page? I'm seeing it right, that i have to call postsMessage on the parents window obj?
[04:50:06] <Xotix> parent.window.postMessage("hello world", "*"); is that the correct use?
[04:54:56] <mindis|wurk> if i have previously used a selector like var things = $('.blaa'); shouldn't i be getting all .blaas with .foo if i do things.find('.foo'); ?
[04:58:36] <quicksilver> mindis|wurk: yes.
[05:01:57] <Goemie> Hello, i want to add a second class to an element with jquery. But when i use .attr('class','className') it just replaces the first class instead of adding a a second class
[05:04:19] <mindis|wurk> Goemie use .addClass('newclass') instead
[05:05:07] <tesmar> the ajaxSend method doesn't give me access to the element that caused the action if I call JS from the console, for ex, $('#item').change()
[05:05:17] <tesmar> it says the currentTarget is the whole document
[05:05:22] <tesmar> but I want #item
[05:06:16] <tesmar> any ideas on how to get it?
[05:06:47] <quicksilver> ajaxSend doesn't know what caused the ajax to be done.
[05:07:02] <quicksilver> you'll have to store that yourself in a variable.
[05:07:19] <risky_s> I am trying to get my text to change color in my nav menu when I hover over the .hover class, without hovering over the text - > http://jsfiddle.net/WFwak/
[05:07:20] <tesmar> quicksilver: if I want to modify the request going out, is aJax Send the best place to do it?
[05:08:35] <quicksilver> seems like a reasonable place tesmar.
[05:09:29] <mindis|wurk> this is really quite interesting. if i loop through my selection with each and log the classes, i see my selection does have elements with the class i'm looking for. yet if i do .find on them with the class, i get empty
[05:09:50] <henn1nk> http://us.gateway.com/gw/en/US/content/home how is this slideshow build? just with supersized?
[05:10:37] <tesmar> quicksilver: where would I set that variable then that tells me which element caused the ajax send? ajaxSend gets the right element if I click on it and don't use the console
[05:13:09] <quicksilver> tesmar: just before your ajax call, in whatever event handler causes the ajax.
[05:20:59] <Gaia>  hey guys! anyone here experience wth caroufredcel?
[05:26:16] <Woet> ?ask @ gal
[05:26:16] <bot-t> gal, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:26:21] <Woet> ?ask @ Gaia
[05:26:21] <bot-t> Gaia, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:26:44] <Gaia> no point asking the question if noone is fammiliar with it
[05:26:53] <Woet> your loss
[05:26:56] <Woet> next please
[05:29:31] <mindis|wurk> hmm, it seems .find() only finds through children. how do i find through the top level of my selection? so if i already stored <div class="foo"></div> and <div class="bar"></div> in a variable, how would i get .foo from that?
[05:32:30] <Woet> mindis|wurk: $(".foo")
[05:33:57] <mindis|wurk> uhm. let me rephrase that. lets say i did myvar = $('div'); before and want the .foo from myvar
[05:34:07] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you can select closest to find parent, or siblings, or nextAll or prevAll
[05:34:47] <xinming> How do we insert a "tr" into a table with jquery?   append prepend insertBefore are not I want.
[05:35:24] <Cork> $('table tbody').append('<tr><td>something</td></tr>')
[05:36:05] <mindis|wurk> Cork ah thanks, closest seems to be doing it nicely
[05:36:08] <lajdr> How should I paste some sample code?
[05:36:12] <xinming> Cork: It works even for empty <tbody?
[05:36:21] <Cork> ?p @ lajdr
[05:36:21] <bot-t> lajdr, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:36:30] <mindis|wurk> didn't want to do .parent().find since i knew there had to be something that would do the same
[05:36:48] <Cork> xinming: if you create a table without a tbody the browser will create one when it parses the page
[05:36:57] <Cork> so yes it will work
[05:37:21] <Cork> mindis|wurk: closest() is NOT the same as .parent().find()
[05:38:02] <Cork> mindis|wurk: closest looks at parent().parent()..... until if finds a parent that matches
[05:38:38] <teleyinex> Hi everyone
[05:38:47] <teleyinex> I've a noob question :)
[05:38:59] <lajdr> Hi, based on some earlier advice I got my thing working... It's here: http://jsfiddle.net/nPEaN/. I'd like some advice on how to write it properly/better. How do I better manage the handlers and remove the duplicate code?
[05:39:06] <teleyinex> I want to initialize some variables from a JSON object
[05:39:33] <teleyinex> the problem is that $.getJSON or $.ajax get the data in async mode
[05:40:05] <teleyinex> I know that there is an option in ajax to change the async mode, but I was wondering if there is a way to do it using the async mode
[05:40:34] <teleyinex> I want to have an init method that fills in the appId after checking the data in an external URL
[05:40:42] <teleyinex> is this possible?
[05:40:55] <Cork> teleyinex: you could use a callback solution and do all your code inside those callbacks
[05:41:14] <Cork> teleject: and there by delay there execution until the json is loaded
[05:41:32] <teleyinex> Cork, you mean using the events like: success, complete, etc., right?
[05:41:34] <Cork> and yes you should do it async
[05:41:48] <Cork> teleject: the success part yes
[05:41:56] <teleyinex> ok
[05:42:24] <teleyinex> and in order to keep the code as clean as possible (I think I think too much in the sync mode, hehe!=
[05:42:36] <teleyinex> I mean, can I have all the methods in a separate part, right?
[05:42:50] <teleyinex> success:setAppID();
[05:43:07] <Cork> thats not really what i meant
[05:43:09] <Cork> one sec
[05:43:18] <teleyinex> ok
[05:43:49] <_helpPlz_> is there someplace where i can suggest for new features or modification of existing functions in jquery?
[05:44:33] <Cork> teleject: http://fiddle.jshell.net/9WJ6q/
[05:45:13] <teleyinex> Cork, let me open it ;)
[05:45:34] <Cork> _helpPlz_: modifications is highly unlicky, as that would result in backwards incompatibility
[05:45:49] <Cork> _helpPlz_: but there is a bug tracker for jquery
[05:46:00] <Cork> *unlikly
[05:46:50] <teleyinex> Cork, so what you are doing is setting glob_data data, when the function returns successfully, right?
[05:46:54] <_helpPlz_> Cork: but i think there can be improvement in certain functions not as in bug but as in features .. so bug tracker is used for those?
[05:46:55] <Cork> teleject: there is one little catch with that structure, you have to make sure to bind the .success before the ready event ends, else the ajax call might happen before you bind
[05:47:21] <Cork> teleject: yes, and then i have two other function thats called when its loaded too
[05:47:49] <teleyinex> Cork, but using the same success event
[05:48:00] <Cork> _helpPlz_: bug tracker (sometimes called issue tracker) is where changes to the code is tracked)
[05:48:14] <teleyinex> Cork, now I get it, you are using the promise, right?
[05:48:16] <Cork> teleyinex: exactly
[05:48:21] <MagmaRules> Guys I'm using the query sortable plugin and it seems to have some problems when i define a sortable inside another sortable. Its very hard to be able to drag an element to an "inner" sortable. Is this an expected behavior ?
[05:48:21] <Cork> yes
[05:48:29] <teleyinex> Wow!!!
[05:48:31] <teleyinex> thanks a lot
[05:48:40] <teleyinex> I'm going to give it a try right now!
[05:49:38] <Cork> teleyinex: actually you might not even need the global variable
[05:49:46] <Andres75> Hello Cork!
[05:49:51] <teleyinex> Cork, yep
[05:49:59] <teleyinex> let me check it by an example
[05:50:01] <teleyinex> ;)
[05:52:45] <Xotix> do you know some good dev toolbar for ie8? the default one seems not to include requests
[05:53:13] <Cork> Xotix: you could try firebug lite
[05:53:18] <Cork> ?g firebug lite
[05:53:19] <bot-t> Cork, Firebug Lite : Firebug - http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
[05:53:24] <arek_deepinit> or firefox
[05:53:25] <arek_deepinit> :D
[05:53:37] <Cork> hard to debug ie8 in firefox >_>
[05:54:44] <arek_deepinit> Cork: its impossible, its one big backdoor
[05:54:55] <Cork> :D
[05:56:28] <Andres75> Anyone up for a payed jQuery job? Please whisper me if interested (I have posted in freelance already)
[05:56:30] <Xotix> Cork sure firebug lite includes requests, network communication?
[05:57:16] <_helpPlz_> sry offtopic but s/whisper/pm
[05:58:06] <Cork> Andres75: this is a support channel, not really for hiring, and i think most ppl here has there hands full already
[05:58:23] <Cork> Xotix: farly sure
[06:00:53] <Cork> Xotix: bleh... looks like i remembered wrong "Net panel / HTTP and XHR monitor"
[06:01:23] <Cork> http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite#WhatsNot
[06:01:38] <Cork> anyway gtg
[06:01:47] <Andres75> see you soon
[06:01:57] <Xotix> hmm ok thanks :( bb
[06:04:52] <Xotix> Cork http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/ maybe this is nice. Just as a note.
[06:06:18] <teleyinex> Cork, in the example that you gave me
[06:06:22] <MagmaRules> Guys it seems that when i have a sortable inside another sortable only the outer sortable triggers the "over" event. Anyway i can change this?
[06:06:37] <teleyinex> xhr will be only called when I declare the variable, right?
[06:06:55] <_helpPlz_> Xotix: if you are using ie8, idk why you need a toolbar? in ie8/9 i believe you already have developer tools + debugger (F12 key) ?
[06:06:56] <teleyinex> so if I want to initialize the data, it will be done just after the declaration
[06:07:22] <Xotix> _helpPlz_:  ie8 doesn't include http monitoring. ie9 does.
[06:28:50] <anli_> Can I modify the contents in a ckeditor before I get the data? (using some jquery to modify links)
[06:39:22] <mattyh88> join #CIA-privatechanXJ15-secureSSL2048
[06:39:28] <mattyh88> oh shit
[06:39:49] <_helpPlz_> lol
[06:44:34] <Xotix> What's the use of postMessage if it doesn't work over different domains? at least in ie it doesn't.
[06:45:16] <Robbo_> I just can't get slow animations working without jitters :/
[06:45:29] <Robbo_> Has anyone been in a situation where they need to do this and gotten it to work?
[06:45:36] <Robbo_> Just seems like browsers can't handle it
[06:51:31] <bobbytek> [] vs new Array(): discuss among yourselves
[06:55:58] <Xotix> if i have sub1.xx.ch and sub2.xx.ch, the second one in an iframe on the first one. how can i cal la function from sub2 which is located at sub1 in ie8?
[06:57:53] <blackspotwiggins> ?mdc document.domain @ Xotix
[06:58:04] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins, No results found for 'document.domain'.
[06:58:07] <blackspotwiggins> huh
[06:58:21] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.domain
[06:58:54] <Xotix> document.domaine is no option.  if i set it to xx.ch i can't set it back to sub1.xx.ch which i need for further scripting stuff. They throw some other errors and this isn't made by me so i won't touch it.
[06:59:07] <blackspotwiggins> then you are SOL
[06:59:19] <Xotix> sol?
[06:59:35] <feyd> I've hit a brick wall in jquery's .load() handler in IE. My code works in all browsers except IE, and I know it's because the .load() callback is firing before the request completes in IE. I can find NO help anywhere or anyone else having similar problems, I desperately need help
[06:59:39] <blackspotwiggins> Xotix, http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=S.O.L.
[06:59:54] <ajpiano> feyd: do you have a demo at this point
[07:00:01] <Xotix> anyway, i thought ie8 support postMessage? Is there somethign wrong when i do parent.window.postMessage()?
[07:00:10] <jorydotcom> Good morning ajpiano
[07:00:12] <feyd> ajpiano: I can make one, give me a few minutes
[07:00:16] <ajpiano> lol hi jorydotcom
[07:00:16] <blackspotwiggins> there is something wrong when you cant change document.domain
[07:00:32] <feyd> ajpiano: is there any way I can use jsfiddle to use .load()
[07:00:41] <feyd> ajpiano: screw it, dropbox it is
[07:00:44] <ajpiano> feyd: yeah, you can mock ajax requests on jsfiddle
[07:00:50] <feyd> oh no kidding
[07:01:03] <feyd> ajpiano: I see it, thanks
[07:01:07] <ajpiano> sweet
[07:01:17] <Xotix> blackice2999: the whole tool is wrong… its old and a peace of sh**** but i need to implement something… if i could change document.domain back to sub1.xx.ch it would work but i can't...
[07:01:48] <Xotix> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/ hopefully this will do it :)
[07:01:55] <blackice2999> Xotix: what you mean ? sorry i dont understand you
[07:02:26] <Xotix> blackice2999: ups, sry. the wrong name :)
[07:02:34] <blackice2999> Xotix: hehe no problem
[07:14:17] <feyd> ajpiano: sorry its taking so long, I'm having some problems with the html ajax api
[07:14:24] <ajpiano> it onyl works with post
[07:14:29] <ajpiano> if you want to do a dropbox if that's easier that's ok
[07:14:43] <feyd> ajpiano: yea, I should do that, it will be faster
[07:24:35] <DerekPioneer> trying to include a script like: getScript('fxg.js') . but for some reason that's being interpreted as: fxg.js?_=1332944600933
[07:26:12] <feyd> ajpiano: of course my example works in IE
[07:26:24] <ajpiano> i had a feeling it would
[07:26:34] <ajpiano> :|
[07:26:40] <beasty> evening all
[07:26:46] <beasty> oh
[07:26:49] <beasty> pre-evening all
[07:27:22] <feyd> ajpiano: ok, ill get a full example then, this is taking far too long, my apologies
[07:27:24] <johnkpaul> I want an IRC extension that would print everyone's timezone if someone makes a comment about time of day
[07:27:29] <johnkpaul> it'd be some fancy NLP
[07:27:39] <feyd> ajpiano: oh wait it's a chained ajax request, thats probably why
[07:27:57] <ajpiano> not sure what you're actually referring to
[07:32:17] <jahrichie> hey y'all, trying to find a way to highlight each image when that respected slide is open (Company Directors  carousel near the bottom)  http://chyeaa.com/charlie-bravo/mgmt/ --  any pointers? .active class?
[07:33:14] <feyd> i'll do a quick explaination: I have a form with a few select fields, when changing the 'products' select element, I re-populate the pricing select element with new options, after which I run a price calculate function that uses the 2 selected option values from those select fields
[07:33:59] <feyd> I run the price calc on the 2nd .load() callback, so everything works in chrome, firefox. But in IE, the price calculation executes before the callback, so it tries to calculate the pricing without having the 2nd field's value, which is needed
[07:34:12] <dr0id> tl;dr
[07:34:12] <feyd> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10868783/ajax-test/index.html - this is the example I was trying to get to break, but it works
[07:34:24] <johnkpaul> jahrichie: what carousel plugin is that?
[07:34:32] <ajpiano> not sure why the execution order would be different in different browsers
[07:34:34] <johnkpaul> each of them have their own way to hook into the sliding event
[07:34:53] <Xotix> how can i trigger a function on an iframes parent cross domain? without docuemnt.domain
[07:34:54] <feyd> ajpiano: me either, but I noticed something on that example, 1 sec
[07:35:34] <jahrichie> johnkpaul outdated dynamic drive version http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel.htm
[07:35:36] <MagmaRules> Anyone knows anything about the source of jquery ui sortable? Im debugging it and it seems that my sortables are correctly identified, but then the "placeholder" is appended to the wrong sortable. Strangely i can't find in the code where it actually decides the container to append to.
[07:35:43] <jahrichie> johnkpaul:  thanks in advance for any help
[07:35:54] <feyd> ajpiano: ah! Ok, I got it to break http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10868783/ajax-test/index.html
[07:36:29] <ajpiano> thats a syntax error :|
[07:36:40] <feyd> ajpiano: oh woops, hang on
[07:36:58] <feyd> oh son of a bitch
[07:37:17] <feyd> so its 2 ajax requests, the 2nd request has a URL parameter that passes a value from the first, IE executes the 2nd request without the data from the first
[07:37:23] <feyd> and it still works here
[07:38:13] <johnkpaul> jahrichie: oh, you'll have to dig into that code, perhaps wrap those functions
[07:38:19] <johnkpaul> I'll be back in a few to help further
[07:39:31] <ajpiano> feyd: is the live page anywhere
[07:40:00] <feyd> ajpiano: no, but it can  be, I just don't want it made public public
[07:40:06] <feyd> but screw it, i cant fix this
[07:40:39] <ajpiano> FTR, having a handful of uninterested strangers help with a specific technical issue doesn't really equate to "public public"
[07:40:48] <feyd> ajpiano: http://warwickpublishing.com/quote2/
[07:41:06] <feyd> ajpiano: change the 'product' (that first select) drop down in IE, it fires the error
[07:41:18] <VictorCL> $this.find("div.panel")   won't find a div that is   <div class="panel hidden"    ???
[07:41:59] <ajpiano> it will, assuming $this is a jQuery object and it has that div inside of it
[07:42:13] <ajpiano> if not, try more question marks
[07:43:57] <ajpiano> feyd: where's the code that controls the selectbox
[07:45:41] <ajpiano> uhhhhmm feyd
[07:45:59] <feyd> sorry typing
[07:46:10] <feyd> ajpiano: line 27 in the script.js file is the product.change() event, then line 173 is the paperPopulate() function, line 182 is where the error is thrown
[07:46:29] <antnash> Hey guys. Can someone tell me what's wrong with this incredibly simple function:
[07:46:46] <feyd> ajpiano: 182 references 'type' as the value of #pricing, which is the 2nd select on the page going from left to right
[07:47:00] <feyd> and that gets filled from the first ajax request
[07:47:08] <antnash> $('#link').click(function() { $('#dropzone').toggleClass('hover'); });
[07:47:17] <ajpiano> feyd: are you actually debugging this using IE's debugger
[07:47:17] <Xotix> if i once set document.domain = "xx.com" can i later change it back to sub.xx.ch?
[07:47:42] <feyd> ajpiano: I tried doing that using a debugger; line, but it just gave me the same exact error and description, except it moved slower
[07:48:21] <feyd> ajpiano: if I force the value of the #pricing element, the error never occurs, so I know the paperPopulate function is executing before #pricing is filled in, despite it being filled in in the .load callback
[07:48:51] <feyd> ajpiano: also, I want to thank you for taking so much time to take a look and help me out
[07:49:02] <ajpiano> i feel bad for your long term suffering
[07:49:38] <ajpiano> i'm a bit skeptical of your tale of whyit's breaking though, digging around
[07:49:53] <coppa> ajpiano: lol
[07:50:07] <ajpiano> feyd: is this the error you're getting: SCRIPT5007: Unable to get value of the property 'indexOf': object is null or undefined script.js, line 182 character 5
[07:50:44] <feyd> ajpiano: I get "'type' is null or not an object" at the same line and char
[07:52:02] <ctk> so I have a div with an id. nested in there is a ul with a bunch of li's. what's the best way to append a new li to that ul?
[07:52:29] <feyd> $('#id ul').append('<li>');
[07:53:14] <feyd> ctk: ^^ or however many you want. I think you have to close them in the append string if you're adding more than 1, but it's probably best to close every one anyway
[07:53:26] <ctk> thanks
[07:54:32] <DerekPioneer> trying to include a script like: getScript('fxg.js') . but for some reason that's being interpreted as: fxg.js?_=1332944600933
[07:54:34] <DerekPioneer> any ideas?
[07:55:03] <ajpiano> it's cache-busting the script
[07:55:07] <ajpiano> by putting a timestamp on it
[07:55:15] <ajpiano> does that adversely affect your application?
[07:56:05] <DerekPioneer> ajpiano: yeah it makes it so fxg.js is 404
[07:56:21] <shoky> you can $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false; })
[07:56:32] <ajpiano> ^^
[07:56:59] <ajpiano> or use $.ajax({dataType:"script", cache: false, url: "script.js"})
[08:00:01] <MercuryTW> bah my changes to my JS aren't being reflected in my browser. Cleared the Firefox cache, did Ctl-F5... any ideas? does WAMP cache files?
[08:00:58] <feyd> MercuryTW: sounds silly but you're sure your paths are all correct? Editing the one that should be loading / loading the one that you're changing?
[08:01:28] <ajpiano> feyd: the call stacks are identical in IE and Chrome
[08:01:29] <MercuryTW> feyd: I checked that... will check again
[08:01:46] <Jon47> ajpiano: I think i read somewhere that the querystring parameters for cache busting are somewhat unreliable if you use a certain type of proxy or something…
[08:01:51] <Jon47> is that not the case any longer?
[08:02:06] <Jon47> this is what i'm talking about … i see it's from 2008: http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/
[08:02:09] <feyd> ajpiano: but you are receiving the same error in IE?
[08:02:19] <ajpiano> yes
[08:02:45] <antnash> Hey guys. Can anyone tell me why this isn't working please  http://pastebin.com/2Q7RScdX
[08:02:52] <feyd> so I'm not crazy
[08:02:57] <jeffsmykil> Anyone know of a good combo check box solution?
[08:03:00] <ajpiano> what's bizarre to me in IE is that at that point where it breaks, $("#pricing").val() returns null, but document.getElementById("pricing").value returns ""
[08:03:10] <MercuryTW> feyd: yeah I'm sure this is right
[08:03:22] <NoiseEee> antnash: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:03:29] <feyd> ajpiano: that is bizarre indeed
[08:05:17] <antnash> NoiseEee, I've added $(document).ready(function() { ..... });  and no cigar
[08:05:17] <feyd> ajpiano: stupid idea, but what about using a setTimeout to delay it? It's clear IE isn't waiting its turn
[08:05:42] <NoiseEee> antnash: create a fiddle, and what exactly is the problem?
[08:05:55] <ajpiano> feyd: i'm just not sure where you get this idea that "ie is going in the wrong order"
[08:06:00] <ajpiano> from what i can tell, it's the same
[08:06:09] <ajpiano> but maybe setTimeout(fn, 0) would bail you out
[08:06:21] <feyd> not order, it just looks like it's jumping ahead too early
[08:06:33] <feyd> proceeding, not jumping, bad wording
[08:06:56] <ajpiano> btw feyd um, ther
[08:07:07] <antnash> NoiseEee: Well it should change colour when I hover over the div, but it's not. I'm not actually using it for just a hover, but this is just a test to see what's going wrong and I can't work out what's going wrong in the test.
[08:07:11] <ajpiano> building this preview string could be so much less code :|
[08:07:37] <feyd> ajpiano: oh god I know, I'm still learning and haven't started to clean up anything, don't judge me :(
[08:09:38] <ajpiano> feyd: trying :p
[08:10:09] <NoiseEee> antnash: please reproduce in a jsfiddle.  i've taken your code and it works fine, besides using javascript instead of css for hovering
[08:10:16] <NoiseEee> antnash: http://jsfiddle.net/6dda9/
[08:10:27] <AdvoWork> I'm currently doing: $.ajax({url : 'item.php',data : data,type : 'post',success : function(data) { } and in the item.php i'm echoing a word. What can i do if i want to return multiple? json?
[08:11:00] <antnash> NoiseEee: Yeah, just realised that it's something else entirely that's in upload.js
[08:11:05] <antnash> sorry about that
[08:11:19] <feyd> ajpiano: so we know IE is executing the code in order, and I know the fault doesn't lie with jquery as my example punched me right in the face, so where can I go from here?
[08:12:45] <Poetro> AdvoWork: yes
[08:14:56] <ajpiano> feyd: not sure, investigating
[08:15:07] <ajpiano> feyd: are you at any point clearing out the selectof all its children options
[08:15:30] <feyd> ajpiano: you're a saint, thanks again - let me check, I thought I was
[08:15:57] <ajpiano> feyd: umm somehow in IE
[08:16:03] <ajpiano> that poor select is ending up with a <span> inside it
[08:16:36] <feyd> ajpiano: yes, that was another issue I had - .load() grabs the element you tell it to, but there's no way to just grab a string without its parent
[08:16:44] <feyd> ajpiano: actually that could be the problem
[08:16:50] <feyd> I compeltely forgot about that
[08:17:17] <brettster> anyone know why I'm getting an error on this
[08:17:21] <brettster> line 1 - char 1
[08:17:22] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3685976
[08:17:28] <brettster> it's only popping up in IE
[08:17:41] <ajpiano> feyd: not using .load, for one thing
[08:18:18] <feyd> $.get()?
[08:18:40] <brettster> ?
[08:19:02] <ajpiano> feyd: yes. using $.get or $.post, then filtering out manually in the callback, and then sticking it whereever you need
[08:19:06] <feyd> brettster: do you have jquery included on your page?
[08:19:15] <brettster> yes
[08:19:40] <feyd> brettster: are you sure it's included correctly? because that would cause it
[08:20:21] <brettster> yes
[08:20:24] <brettster> it's in a cms
[08:20:29] <ajpiano> feyd: wy are you returning all the options wrapped in a span
[08:20:29] <brettster> that uses jquery
[08:20:30] <brettster> c5
[08:20:31] <ajpiano> there's absolutely no reason to
[08:20:34] <johnkpaul> jahrichie: did you figure it out?
[08:20:50] <ajpiano> feyd: i'm relatively confident that that's the problem
[08:21:10] <feyd> ajpiano: because I got angry when I couldn't get a $.get to unwrap it - and I believe you're right with it being the problem, I had completely forgotten about that
[08:21:18] <antnash> NoiseEee: I've discovered my problem. It's when I try to add an eventlistener (filedrag.addEventListener("dragover", FileDragHover, false);) that it doesn't pass that point.
[08:21:43] <ajpiano> feyd: in case you're curiousa bout the thought process that led me to that
[08:21:45] <NoiseEee> antnash: look at 'filedrag' support, whatever that is
[08:21:52] <feyd> ajpiano: i'll convert the loads and extract the string and let you know. Again, thank you thank you thank you, I immensely appreciate your help
[08:21:54] <ajpiano> i was like, well, why would a select that's clearly in the dom return "null" from val
[08:22:14] <ajpiano> then i looked at the fact that the select was like, completly empty
[08:22:19] <ajpiano> feyd: you don't have to convert them
[08:22:24] <ajpiano> just change the response to not wrap the options in a span
[08:22:26] <NoiseEee> antnash: read what your console tells you about errors etc
[08:22:28] <ajpiano> which is completley pointless
[08:22:49] <antnash> NoiseEee: function FileDragHover has been created. filedrag just refers to a div (var filedrag = $('#dropzone');
[08:22:50] <feyd> ajpiano: oh do I wish I could - I'm in VB.NET hell
[08:22:59] <brettster> ok
[08:23:01] <brettster> thanks guys
[08:23:08] <NoiseEee> antnash: your console holds the clues, also fiddle it
[08:23:15] <ajpiano> feyd: IE is going to basically hate you if you try to work with completley invalid html like that
[08:23:35] <ajpiano> cause when it constructs a DOM after innerhtmling a string like that
[08:23:40] <feyd> ajpiano: the irony is staggering that it's .NET that requires the span, and IE that reads it and breaks
[08:23:41] <ajpiano> it's going to strip all the options out of the span
[08:23:59] <ajpiano> surely .NET doesn't "require a span"
[08:24:03] <xinming> I got $('#id_of_tr'), I know we have html(), But how do we get all the node content appending it to a tbody include the <tr> itself too please?
[08:24:09] <ajpiano> it's some other limitation or requirement of .NET
[08:24:47] <xinming> Since for now,  $('tbody').append($('#id_of_tr').html())  creates td directly under tbody.
[08:24:49] <ajpiano> $("#id_of_tr").appendTo("#someOther Table tbody") will move the tr
[08:24:55] <ajpiano> you don't need to do .html or anything
[08:25:03] <xinming> ajpiano: Thanks, I'll try
[08:26:16] <MercuryTW> yeah so I'm retarded
[08:26:34] <xmaddness> grats?
[08:26:45] <MercuryTW> it's better than the code not working I guess
[08:27:24] <antnash> NoiseEee: I've tried the chrome firebug console, but not getting any output at all. The fiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/gMwHw/

[08:28:24] <improwizacja> How to check what element is this element: $(this)
[08:28:36] <ajpiano> improwizacja: use your developer tools

[08:28:42] <improwizacja> firebug?
[08:28:45] <ajpiano> yes
[08:28:50] <ajpiano> console.log( this )
[08:28:52] <improwizacja> good idea
[08:32:10] <feyd> ajpiano: Welp, you're my savior. You figured it out for me, outputtng just text without the span fixed it. It was the damn markup the whole time. Some additional good news is I learned how to just output text in VB.NET, so...hooray
[08:32:26] <ajpiano> :)
[08:32:35] <improwizacja> ajpiano i stack
[08:33:06] <ajpiano> feyd: IE *really* doesn't like invalid markup being dynamically injected
[08:33:28] <ajpiano> so now you know to watch out for that as well
[08:33:35] <feyd> ajpiano: lesson learned, and it will never be forgotten. If you message me your home address I'll send you high res xerox's of my man boobs, you know, if you want
[08:33:39] <ajpiano> feyd: now if you just start using array literals instead of new Array, i'll feel god about myself today

[08:53:26] <DaveJ|UK> I suspect I am just misunderstanding how the loop works because I don't get an error, I just end up with an empty element
[08:53:41] <feyd> VictorCL: $(this).parent("div").animate({'height':'0'},700, function(){$(this).css('padding', '0'});
[08:54:28] <VictorCL> feyd but I need to show that element again .. so I will need that 5px padding
[08:54:46] <feyd> VictorCL: create a class that removes the padding, then you can toggle the class when it's hidden/shown
[08:55:02] <feyd> VictorCL: and use .toggleClass('nopad') or whatever
[08:55:06] <VictorCL> :/ hoped there was an easer way
[08:55:11] <feyd> VictorCL: thats not easy?
[08:55:16] <feyd> that seems pretty damn easy
[08:55:28] <feyd> you won't get much simpler than that
[08:55:57] <VictorCL> ok
[08:56:01] <feyd> $(this).parent("div").animate({'height':'0'},700).toggleClass('nopad'); - thats it
[08:56:25] <improwizacja> feyd Please small hint
[08:56:29] <feyd> then create the css for it and toggle it again when you bring the height back up from 0

[08:58:17] <devkinetic> hi guys i wrote some ajax for a portion of my site (slider with ajax content) and when a different portion of my page finishes its own ajax request, all my items in my slider disappear and the script breaks. i cant see any errors... how can i debug this?
[08:58:21] <feyd> improwizacja: I think you'll be better off working from example code, but you should continue to learn what everything does, so look at the javascript they do just to get an idea
[08:58:47] <patpong> Hi all, my page has an element with class "foo" that is added to the DOM after the main page loads. As soon as this element is added, I want to execute a function on it, how can I do this?
[08:59:19] <DaveJ|UK> surely you can just run your code after you add it?
[08:59:49] <patpong> @DaveJ no I can't becaue it's not my code that adds it, it's some 3rd party piece of integration crap
[09:00:14] <DaveJ|UK> then you need that third party plugin to notify your own script saomehow
[09:00:34] <improwizacja> , so look at the javascript they do just to get an idea Say it another way
[09:00:44] <improwizacja> feyd
[09:01:03] <feyd> improwizacja: look at their code and learn from it
[09:01:12] <improwizacja> ok
[09:02:00] <feyd> improwizacja: you're going to have a hell of a time learning jquery - everyone in here speaks english, all the documentation is in english, and many examples and tutorials online are in english
[09:02:51] <jugglinmike> patpong: depending on how quickly you want to respond to the event, you could set up a polling schedule
[09:03:01] <Chopps> improwizacja http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/AJ2HW/4/

[09:03:17] <thang> patpong: try $(window).load
[09:04:15] <Chopps> so guy, i have a date with yy-mm-dd format, and i want to convert it to dd MM yy format, so i used jquery ui's $.datepicker formatDate method to reformat my date, but im getting the wrong date. why is that happening? here and example: http://jsfiddle.net/JVHOLiK/g5zH7/ hope u guys can help me figure this out
[09:04:19] <feyd> improwizacja: well thats good, good luck to you
[09:06:59] <ajpiano> Chopps: you have to use a valid date string when passing to the Date constructor
[09:07:25] <ajpiano> Chopps: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse
[09:09:13] <Chopps> oh, so thats what im doing wrong, thanks for the info ajpiano :D
[09:11:45] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:11:45] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/zgWL2/9/
[09:11:49] <lenswipe> can someone help out with that?
[09:12:02] <lenswipe> i want a click event handler to fire when an <option> element is clicked
[09:12:07] <lenswipe> how do i go about that?
[09:13:49] <meowsus> I need to write a function that fires *after* a list of images are fully loaded on-page. What function am i looking for?
[09:14:03] <_helpPlz_> ready?
[09:14:10] <antnash> NoiseEee: Just in case it interests you, for some reason jquery wasn't passing the datatransfer object. Solved it with getElemById and addEventListener
[09:14:48] <NoiseEee> antnash: glad you solved it :)
[09:14:59] <ajpiano> antnash: it's possible to get aholdof those properties in jquery handlers
[09:15:12] <meowsus> Like, I have ten images on my site, all set to 0 opacity, and after they are successfully loaded into the document, i need to fade them in.
[09:15:22] <antnash> Cheers for the pointers NoiseEee
[09:15:24] <yogig> meowsus: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[09:15:37] <antnash> ajpiano, How?! I would much prefer to use jquery if I can.
[09:15:38] <ajpiano> antnash: the original unwrapped browser event is available in jquery event handlersas event.originalEvent
[09:15:53] <ajpiano> and you can also tell jquery to include an arbitrary properties from the native event in the object
[09:16:07] <meowsus> yogig, good one
[09:16:34] <yogig> I'm using it for something similar, images loading lazily once their container enters the viewport, then fading up.
[09:16:37] <yogig> Works like a champ.
[09:16:58] <ajpiano> with jQuery.event.props.push("dataTransfer")
[09:17:04] <VictorCL> I ha ve setTimeout("notify_teacher_answer_popup()",4000);
[09:17:22] <VictorCL> and above I have function notify_teacher_answer_popup()  .. but I get  notify_teacher_answer_popup is not defined
[09:17:40] <ajpiano> VictorCL: just reference the function, don't force it to eval
[09:17:50] <ajpiano> setTimeout( notify_teacher_answer_popup, 4000 )
[09:18:12] <meowsus> yogig, yeah, I'm only running into webkit issues. Thinks all the images are 6px wide, but that's because it's reading the border width.
[09:19:38] * meowsus gives yogig a hi-five
[09:24:15] <ihdev> is there a way to disable all clicks except for 1 in a browser window... I have a modal that pops up with a timer and I want to make sure that the user doesn't click behind the modal on another dom element to trigger an event I don't want
[09:25:12] <feyd> ajpiano: can you explain why setTimeout and other functions like that require a reference to the function? I know to do that, but I don't understand why
[09:25:25] <ajpiano> wat
[09:25:34] <devkinetic> hi guys i wrote some ajax for a portion of my site (slider with ajax content) and when a different portion of my page finishes its own ajax request, all my items in my slider disappear and the script breaks. i cant see any errors... how can i debug this?
[09:25:42] <ajpiano> a func reference is like, ok, call this function in the set period of time
[09:25:46] <ajpiano> the stringy version is like
[09:25:52] <ajpiano> run eval on this code in the set period of time
[09:25:56] <ajpiano> so it's mad much grosser that way
[09:26:04] <ajpiano> Technically Speaking™
[09:26:09] <feyd> naturally
[09:26:19] <feyd> thanks
[09:26:51] <yogig> I wanna make a keyboard shortcut for "Technically Speaking™"
[09:27:51] <KevlarSoul> Is there a way to make the button color change color to whichever div is showing, http://jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/
[09:28:23] <KevlarSoul> Like change the color of <h7> whenever the particular div is revealed?
[09:28:36] <KevlarSoul> Should I do that in jquery, or in CSS?
[09:28:56] <Chopps> KevlarSoul why not use .css()
[09:28:56] <KevlarSoul> I want the hover color to remain "on"
[09:29:42] <yogig> KevlarSoul: bind to .button instead of individually, then add/removeClass to define the 'active' color
[09:29:56] <feyd> KevlarSoul: create a class in CSS, then add the class to the div  you want to have colored
[09:29:59] <yogig> keep your styles in the ss layer.
[09:30:02] <yogig> css*
[09:30:44] <KevlarSoul> okay okay...Im new so Im trying to keep up
[09:31:36] <KevlarSoul> I create an alternate heading, like h7X and I can add it to the div, how would i do that in jquery
[09:31:53] <KevlarSoul> <h7x>
[09:32:53] <EchoBravo> i think they're saying to use something like $('h7').addClass('.active')
[09:33:09] <EchoBravo> and then have the styles on css class .active
[09:33:17] <yogig> KevlarSoul: Roughly, http://jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/2/
[09:33:20] <KevlarSoul> ohhh
[09:33:49] <yogig> You should try to abstract all those click events into a single binding though.
[09:33:52] <feyd> is <h7> even valid?
[09:34:00] <feyd> or is it just for example's sake
[09:34:30] <KevlarSoul> :|  well, I added it normally there are 6 h's
[09:34:31] <KevlarSoul> lol
[09:34:48] <KevlarSoul> ahhh
[09:34:50] <feyd> I wouldn't use h7
[09:34:51] <KevlarSoul> that's interesting
[09:35:08] <KevlarSoul> really, why? I figured 6 why not 7 ...or for that matter 100
[09:35:27] <yogig> h1 through h6 are part of the spec. h7 is not
[09:35:30] <feyd> it's not a valid tag, you can't just make them up unless you tell the browsers what they are manually
[09:35:35] <feyd> which you're not doing
[09:35:36] <arphen> hi! How would you return a boolean value in an ajax call? I'm making a call to a server and i just want TRUE or FALSE as an answer
[09:35:43] <KevlarSoul> oh
[09:35:53] <KevlarSoul> its working?
[09:36:08] <feyd> KevlarSoul: try it in older IE, it wont
[09:36:09] <KevlarSoul> I mean I tested in on ie, chrome, and firefox and ios
[09:36:13] <DaveJ|UK> arphen: thats server side
[09:36:20] <DaveJ|UK> .NET handles it automatically
[09:36:23] <DaveJ|UK> i dont know about php
[09:36:25] <feyd> KevlarSoul: we're not just making it up, simply use another tag, it's not going to put you out
[09:36:31] <arphen> would you use json or plaintext or ...
[09:36:38] <KevlarSoul> feyd Okay, I will. thanks for the tip!
[09:36:40] <feyd> arphen: have the ajax call return a string, then compare it on the ajax callback and make sure it matches, then return true
[09:36:48] <KevlarSoul> I hadnt run it through validate yet
[09:36:48] <DaveJ|UK> if it's to be consumed by js then use json
[09:37:02] <arphen> feyd : no elegant solution then, eh?
[09:37:06] <devkinetic> how can i debug conflicting ajax requests. when one finishes it kills the other
[09:37:17] <feyd> arphen: not that I know of, but I'm no authority
[09:37:21] <KevlarSoul> yogig thats a big help, Im goign to try and make it so its the text color not the button color?
[09:37:28] <EchoBravo> .net can return a bool  o.O
[09:37:37] <arphen> which jquery ajax call would you then use? just plain "script" ?
[09:37:58] <amit_usual> how do i use jquery ui time picker on an already overlayed div
[09:38:00] <arphen> or just jQuery.ajax()
[09:38:32] <yogig> arphen: Why not just use json? { status: true } as the return or similar.
[09:39:25] <feyd> arphen: you could use .load(), then check the textStatus to see if it's 'success' in the complete() callback
[09:39:59] <yogig> That's just dirty.
[09:40:06] <yogig> If you're checking data, make data.
[09:40:12] <EchoBravo> yogig: what are you using on the backend?
[09:40:31] <yogig> Eh? To make json?
[09:40:35] <feyd> yogig: yea you're right
[09:40:39] <yogig> Any backend language. : P
[09:40:48] <EchoBravo> to recieve the ajax request....
[09:41:35] <brettster> Does anyone here have experience with sudoslider
[09:41:56] <yogig> I'm not sure what you're asking. Any backend language can consume a get or a post and return JSON.
[09:43:29] <arphen> so yogig  you're suggesting i return a json object ?
[09:43:35] <arphen> containing only "false" or "true"?
[09:44:28] <yogig> I'm saying that, if this is meant to be absorbed by JS, yeah. You should return a JSON object with a meaningful key. {whatThisDoes: true/false}
[09:45:24] <yogig> Beyond just being good practice, it'll play nicely with jquery's methods.
[09:45:52] <arphen> thanks, that was the advice i was looking for
[09:45:52] <KevlarSoul> is .activebutton a specific jquery function or is it just happen to be the class you made up?
[09:46:14] <yogig> I just made it up. Could be anything.
[09:46:14] <KevlarSoul> yogig this didnt work http://jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/3/
[09:46:18] <KevlarSoul> ahh
[09:54:18] <Helmar> newbie question: How can I limit a click.function() to a particular #id? I have two hidden segments that a click makes visible, but a click on either shows both rather than just one.
[09:54:40] <primetime> Hi is there any way to get a jquery UI hide effect like blind to function so that it occurs at the top instead of in the middle?
[09:55:16] <feyd> Helmar: $('#thing-you-click').click(function(){ $('#id-you-want-to-show').show() });
[09:55:22] <jacof> What's the matter with this: http://jsfiddle.net/kjcX8/1/ ??
[09:55:37] <feyd> Helmar: just make sure the things you're hiding/showing have identifiers that let you single them out, ID's are the most obvious
[09:56:59] <Helmar> feyd: thanks, this is how it looks now: jQuery(document.body).click(function () {jQuery("#getImage").fadeOut("fast");jQuery("#sb_image").fadeIn("slow");});
[09:57:09] <feyd> jacof: you have php tags in the middle of your script - does this have a PHP file extension where it sits on your server, and are you serving it up with the JS MIME type?
[09:57:39] <Helmar> feyd: problem is that it also opens #getQuote and hides #sb_quote, although not clicked
[09:58:12] <feyd> Helmar: can you post your working code in a jsfiddle.net?
[09:58:13] <jacof> feyd yes but this fiddle should work without any PHP (using the jsFiddle API), where do you see a php tag? I missed it
[09:58:28] <jacof> OK got it.
[09:58:28] <feyd> jacof: var json_upload_location = <?php echo json_encode(wp_upload_dir()); ?
[09:58:40] <ravenzz> quoted
[09:59:03] <Helmar> feyd:  problem is visible here: http://www.spiritguidance.net/wp/category/event/  will past code just now
[09:59:38] <feyd> Helmar: where can I see it in action on that page?
[10:00:18] <jacof> OK. Now its like its supposed to be. http://jsfiddle.net/kjcX8/2/ . Still doesn't run :(
[10:01:12] <Helmar> feyd:  sidebar "click here"
[10:01:19] <feyd> jacof: you have a syntax error at i, "http://jsfiddle.net/echo/jsonp/?delay=" + n + "&data=" + i
[10:01:31] <Altreus> How do I tell the jquery UI datepicker to use UTC dates? Currently it's subtracting 1h from the midnight I pick, thus sending back yesterday
[10:01:39] <Helmar> feyd: one click opens both hidden IDs
[10:01:42] <bobbytek> Which is preferable: [] or new Array()
[10:01:47] <feyd> bobbytek: []
[10:01:51] <jonkri> how am i supposed to name the <button> element (or its class) so that it looks like in the themeroller?
[10:01:58] <KevlarSoul> jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/5/  still not changing the button text :(
[10:02:10] <KevlarSoul> I made a css class for it
[10:02:16] <KevlarSoul> '.activeheader'
[10:02:23] <bobbytek> feyd, any reason in particular?
[10:02:35] <Helmar> feyd: http://jsfiddle.net/GqnJe/
[10:02:38] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: hey man you around?
[10:02:56] <feyd> bobbytek: I couldn't tell you, I was using new Array() until today when someone much smarter told me to use []
[10:03:01] <Helmar> feyd: that's the code for the two WP widgets
[10:03:01] <yogig> performance
[10:03:09] <yogig> @bobbytek / feyd
[10:03:32] <bobbytek> yogig, really? I thought they would be the same
[10:03:44] <bobbytek> isn't one just a synonym for the other?
[10:04:41] <yogig> bobbytek: Let me double-check. Seems like I saw a perf test.
[10:05:06] <Altreus> new Array() is ugly and [] is not
[10:06:26] <yogig> http://jsperf.com/new-array-vs-literal/9
[10:06:38] <feyd> Helmar: I'll be back, sit tight
[10:06:41] <yogig> Take that for what you will. ;)
[10:08:36] <yogig> http://jsperf.com/array-literal-vs-new-array-with-length
[10:08:45] <bobbytek> yogig, cool thanks!
[10:13:21] <jacof> http://jsfiddle.net/kjcX8/3/ <- JSON.encode is not a function. {"error":"Please use the POST data type."} <- ?
[10:13:28] <feyd> Helmar: so why are you showing these elements when you click the body of the entire document?
[10:13:40] <feyd> Helmar: you have the same exact event tied to 2 bits of code, so they both show
[10:15:03] <jacof> What's wrong with it?
[10:15:18] <Helmar> feyd: yes, I figured. As a newbie, can you tell me how to limit it to the click on the #id element?
[10:15:25] <feyd> jacof: jsfiddle's ajax API requires you to use POST to retrieve any data
[10:15:38] <feyd> Helmar: making an example
[10:15:44] <jacof> feyd: but I am setting type: "POST", explicitly
[10:16:18] <feyd> jacof: I got nothin, your code is over my head
[10:16:29] <jacof> and mine
[10:16:33] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/8/
[10:20:24] <feyd> Helmar: http://jsfiddle.net/GqnJe/15/
[10:21:05] <feyd> Helmar: you have to tell it to run when you click something other than the entire document's body tag, which is literally anywhere on the page. This example has you click the divs that you hide anyway
[10:21:38] <Helmar> feyd, you rock! Thanks so much. Yes, this makes perfect sense! Much appreciated!
[10:22:30] <yogig> jacof: ajax data is already a json object
[10:22:40] <yogig> why are you running json.decode inside of it?
[10:22:43] <Innocentus> hi
[10:22:48] <Innocentus> I got an implementation question
[10:23:29] <Innocentus> There is an ul list with many elements which has got javascript functionality added, but it degrades to a normal list with links if javascript is not available
[10:23:38] <jacof> yogig Its redundant in the jsFiddle but in the actual code I need it to test the response
[10:23:41] <arphen> does anyone have a good vim-indentation setting for javascript? the default sucks
[10:23:48] <jacof> yogig It shouldn't be any problem though right ?
[10:24:03] <Innocentus> now each entry of list got a number of zoom view - each zoom view consists of thumb and zoom image
[10:24:17] <jacof> yogig I'm not even seeing a response from the first ajax call
[10:24:20] <KevlarSoul> On a scale of 1 to idiot, how far off am I from getting this right? http://jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/9/
[10:24:34] <Innocentus> currently, the user gets to another page in order to see the thumbs and being able to select one for zoom
[10:24:42] <KevlarSoul> active div hover change remains in place
[10:24:43] <feyd> Helmar: it will help you tremendously if you learn the DOM and know what's what in both html documents and when working with html elements in javascript, document.body is <body>, which is the whole document. those 2 things showed when you clicked anywhere, and they both showed at the same time because they were run on the same event (body click)
[10:24:58] <Innocentus> now jquery should show a div instead and the thunbs and the zoomed image when an element in list is clicked
[10:25:11] <Innocentus> but where to store the data for thunbs and their zoom images for this element?
[10:25:23] <Innocentus> inlne as javascript array? I thought about using the data-element
[10:25:25] <yogig> jacof: yeah, because its breaking on that json.encode call
[10:25:28] <Innocentus> what would you recommend to me?
[10:25:47] <Innocentus> how can I store an object / array in a data-attribute?
[10:25:53] <feyd> KevlarSoul: whats this supposed to do?
[10:25:55] <jacof> yogig But that's what it says on the jsFiddle documentation. I'll take it away
[10:25:55] <KevlarSoul> This is just another instance of I dont understand the answer to my question, Im going to go shoot myself now.
[10:25:56] <KevlarSoul> lol
[10:26:36] <yogig> jacof: Hah, I may just not understand what you're trying to do.
[10:26:38] <KevlarSoul> feyd, my hope is that when the active div is chosen, the hover change remains in place
[10:26:49] <KevlarSoul> feyd "activeh6"
[10:27:21] <feyd> KevlarSoul: so you want the text to be purple when the quote is visible
[10:27:23] <jacof> OK conclusion: the code is too tangled up. I'll try to clean it up.
[10:27:28] <KevlarSoul> feyd this is what Im working on, I just want the text to remain purple to show them what theyve chosen is active, a small thing but I thought it would be a nice touch
[10:27:28] <KevlarSoul> http://semiaspa.com/index-1.html#Facials
[10:27:47] <dk_atx> Can someone show me what I'm doing wrong.   ...   http://jsfiddle.net/NYU4D/  ...   I'm trying to track links and write them to a db.   Only when I click a link, I see it "aborting" the call via firebug.
[10:27:57] <KevlarSoul> feyd, yes
[10:27:57] <feyd> KevlarSoul: alright hang on a minute
[10:28:16] <Helmar> feyd, when I looked at the code, this became apparent too. But I am not really savvy in DOM (yet). BTW, used your code on the site, but no success yet. Wrapped it with $(document).ready(function(){ and now it's all working. Once again THANK YOU!
[10:28:33] <yogig> jacof: I'd say the problem with that is that right there, you've lost scope to window. you can say data:{json:console.log(JSON)} and it'll log out the JSON object
[10:28:43] * Helmar thanks feyd
[10:29:10] <Innocentus> I got a question
[10:29:14] <Innocentus> There is an ul list with many elements which has got javascript functionality added, but it degrades to a normal list with links if javascript is not available
[10:29:18] <Innocentus> now each entry of list got a number of zoom view - each zoom view consists of thumb and zoom image

[10:29:39] <Innocentus> inlne as javascript array? I thought about using the data-element
[10:29:44] <wfq> hi guys
[10:29:49] <Innocentus> how can I store an object / array in a data-attribute?
[10:29:55] <Innocentus> what would you recommend to me?
[10:30:05] <feyd> Helmar: you're welcome, just keep learning and dont be the designer who only uses other people's snippets, you'll be a pro in no time if you continue to learn
[10:31:09] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: I'm fairly sure that a data attribute can be an arbitrary json object
[10:32:04] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: so I just put a serialized json array/object into the data-attribute and jquery is able to read it out by using data()?
[10:32:18] <arphen> how can i check 2 objects for equality?
[10:33:14] <johnkpaul> omni5cience: O dpm
[10:33:16] <johnkpaul> oops
[10:33:30] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: I don't now if it will automatically be parsed, I don't remember
[10:33:36] <johnkpaul> but you can use .parseJSON if it doens't
[10:33:41] <johnkpaul> ?parseJSON
[10:33:41] <bot-t> jQuery.parseJSON(json): Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[10:33:54] <feyd> KevlarSoul: almost done
[10:34:04] <KevlarSoul> feyd im not going anywhere :D
[10:34:07] <johnkpaul> arphen: what kind of equality?
[10:34:07] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: do you think using data-attributes for the ul list lis is a good idea?
[10:34:10] <johnkpaul> deep equality?
[10:34:25] <arphen> i just want to know if all attributes match
[10:34:35] <dk_atx> Or maybe a better question is, what would cause an .ajax call to abort?
[10:34:52] <arphen> basically my problem is simple, i have an original array
[10:35:07] <arphen> then i take a subset of that array and make a new array out of that
[10:35:22] <arphen> then i want to go through the original array and do something when the current object is also in the sub array
[10:35:24] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: for the example which you describe, I think it's a good idea, as long as the javascript-less fallback still allows the zoomed image to be found by clicking
[10:35:48] <johnkpaul> arphen: what do you mean the current object?
[10:35:58] <feyd> KevlarSoul: http://jsfiddle.net/nGzMC/11/
[10:36:05] <johnkpaul> you might want to look at underscore.js's contains
[10:36:12] <feyd> KevlarSoul: note the CSS changes and the first <h6> having a class in the HTML
[10:36:13] <johnkpaul> arphen: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[10:36:17] <arphen> in a foreach
[10:36:30] <johnkpaul> even if you don't use underscore, you can take a look at how they implement _.contains
[10:37:20] <arphen> $.each(motherarray,function(index,value){if(subarray.contains(value)){do_something()}}
[10:37:27] <arphen> no easy way to do it?
[10:37:47] <KevlarSoul> okay!
[10:37:51] <KevlarSoul>  Going to check it out now
[10:37:58] <ajpiano> ?inArray @ arphen
[10:37:58] <bot-t> arphen, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[10:38:26] <arphen> even if the members are objects?
[10:38:33] <ajpiano> nope
[10:38:38] <ajpiano> only works for simple types
[10:38:41] <KevlarSoul> YOU DID IT!
[10:38:44] <arphen> so no easy way?
[10:38:45] <arphen> ok..
[10:39:02] <feyd> KevlarSoul: yes, now study the changes and learn from it; learn how it works
[10:39:03] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: the fallback would be a link which leads to a page where the zoom and the thumbs are shown, when no thumb is selected, the first thumb will be selected automatically and the zoom for it is shown
[10:39:30] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: Now I thought about fading in a div with jquery and showing the thumbs from the data-array
[10:39:32] <KevlarSoul> feyd Excellent!! I will, because I have to recreate it in the actual site. Awesome thank you so much!! Do you have a blog/facebook?
[10:39:47] <ajpiano> hmm arphen i mean, it might work if they are actually references to the same exact object
[10:39:56] <ajpiano> arphen: but if they are just two objects that look identical
[10:40:02] <ajpiano> they won't be equal
[10:40:02] <arphen> is that handled consistently in javascript?
[10:40:14] <ajpiano> references are handled consistently
[10:40:27] <arphen> i have one mother array and take a bunch of items out of that mother array and add it to a new array called subarray
[10:40:27] <ajpiano> but {foo: "bar"} is not === to {foo: "bar"}
[10:40:31] <feyd> KevlarSoul: nope
[10:40:41] <feyd> KevlarSoul: you can pay me with your soul though
[10:40:45] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: those are both valid options, all I was saying was that the use of the data attribute is fine and also it is good that you're falling back nicely for javascript-less clients
[10:40:57] <arphen> but if i have mother=[objA,objB,objC]
[10:41:10] <arphen> and sub=[mother[0]]
[10:41:16] <arphen> is sub[0]==mother[0]?
[10:41:19] <johnkpaul> arphen: those should ===
[10:41:29] <arphen> can i count on it? ^^
[10:41:32] <ajpiano> yea, those will ===
[10:41:33] <ajpiano> yes
[10:41:40] <arphen> great
[10:41:43] <arphen> thanks
[10:41:56] <arphen> im off to the javacsript console to find out
[10:41:58] <KevlarSoul> feyd, excellent, I have lots of Souls, how many you need? :D
[10:42:08] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: if this is now an ul list with many lis and each li contains an image, the internet connection is quite loaded - are there any ways to force an image load order with jquery so the image in first li is loaded before the image in second li and so on?
[10:42:29] <arphen> yes it works, thanks
[10:42:31] <windsurf_> I could build this easily enough but is there an existing plugin to do this thumbnail scroller (just the thumbs)? http://1.s3.envato.com/files/18358267/index.html
[10:42:53] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: you want to force it to always load in that order, even if the images are cached?
[10:43:00] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery lazy load images
[10:43:01] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Lazy Load Plugin for jQuery - http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[10:43:08] <johnkpaul> ^ @ Innocentus
[10:44:36] <arphen> yep works nicely
[10:44:42] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: it would be good if the user sees the image in first LI before the others and so on because the list formatted scrollable horizontally and only a part is shown at time
[10:44:47] <arphen> so objects are always passed by reference?
[10:45:02] <johnkpaul> arphen: there's no passing going on in your example
[10:45:14] <johnkpaul> but to functions, yes they are
[10:45:16] <arphen> well not exactly
[10:45:41] <KevlarSoul> feyd im going to try and impelement it right now, I'll shoot you the url of the outcome if you are interested
[10:45:44] <johnkpaul> objects are not values, they arereferences
[10:45:50] <arphen> but my statement is correct nonetheless, in that variables assigned to objects will always hold the reference as their value
[10:46:08] <johnkpaul> yup
[10:46:32] <arphen> references are values
[10:46:37] <johnkpaul> ?eval var myobj = {"hello":"world"};var test = myobj;test.hello = "notworld";test.hello;
[10:46:40] <bot-t> johnkpaul: "notworld"
[10:47:45] <feyd> KevlarSoul: sure thing
[10:49:13] <muley> Why does $.ajaxForm() with {iframe:true} not work when you return &quot;? example: http://adam.cirkuit.net/ajax-quotes
[10:52:02] <ph88_> http://pastebin.com/XcSGedn3 Why does this happen? error: $("#lists") is null

[10:56:39] <antgel> hi all, having a terrible time setting background of jquery ui dialogs.  the supplied css contains .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content { background: none; }.  i'm trying to over-ride that with .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content.ui-widgetcontent { background: red; }, which i believe *should be more specific* but it's doing nothing.
[10:57:15] <antgel> note my syntax for .ui-dialog-content.ui-widgetcontent without the space as the two classes belong to the same element
[10:57:29] <antgel> please can someone advise me what i'm doing wrong, i'm tearing my hair out
[10:58:30] <antgel> please ignore typos - .ui-widgetcontent should be .ui-widget-content
[10:58:36] <VernonK> antgel: The CSS files are loading in the correct order then?  UI CSS before you're custom CSS?
[10:59:08] <antgel> i don't even see my .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content.ui-widget-content { background: red; } in firebug, when i disable the defaults
[10:59:09] <VernonK> antgel:  Possibly have a link to a page where we can see?
[10:59:11] <antgel> VernonK: yes
[10:59:18] <antgel> VernonK: i wish, it's on the intranet
[10:59:25] <VernonK> ah
[11:00:08] <VernonK> What happens if you remove the .ui-widget-content selector and have the same rule that sets to none?
[11:00:18] <antgel> the thing is, i would expect to see .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content.ui-widget-content { background: red; } represented in firebug, even with a strikethrough if it was being overridden
[11:00:30] <VernonK> You're right
[11:00:40] <anphonic> not being there could mean a couple things.
[11:00:41] <VernonK> That's what makes me think there must be an issue with the selector
[11:00:58] <antgel> VernonK: i don't quite get what you mean by "same rule"
[11:01:22] <antgel> i'm just looking for the simplest way to override the jquery ui css without having to edit the jquery ui css file
[11:01:34] <antgel> anphonic: couple of things such as?
[11:01:37] <anphonic> br browser is receiving it not as a css file (ie wrong mime type) or the selector has something wrong with it
[11:02:24] <antgel> is my syntax essentially correct?  does .ui-dialog-content.ui-widget-content select <div class="dialog ui-dialog-content ui-widget-content"...>?
[11:02:50] <antgel> (note the extra dialog class, but i'd still expect it to be selected)
[11:02:53] <anphonic> .ui-dialog-content.ui-widget-content  you do have the space there right? I know you said ignore the typos but
[11:03:10] <VernonK> Well both of those classes are on the same div so the no space makes sense
[11:03:14] <antgel> anphonic: no, as i said ^^, there is no space.
[11:03:17] <antgel> VernonK: okay
[11:03:22] <VernonK> What about removing the .ui-widget-content selector
[11:03:22] <fedejp> good afternoon guys, can you check out this question? thanks! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9894716/jquery-smoothdivscroll-works-awkwardly
[11:03:25] <stongo1> how would I used the :checked selector with $(this)?
[11:03:41] <VernonK> That's what I meant by "same rule" from the jQuery UI CSS
[11:04:12] <stongo1> ie. if ($(this:checked)) { ...
[11:04:58] <ajpiano> stongo1: if ( $(this).is(":checked") ) { }
[11:05:08] <anphonic> $this is not my stron point lol
[11:05:12] <anphonic> sttrong*
[11:05:15] <anphonic> gah
[11:05:23] <stongo1> ajpiano: ok great, thanks!
[11:07:19] <Advocated> I have <input id="client_search_name" name="client_search_name" type="text" placeholder="Eg. Dave Smith" data-field="name"...........  and do: alert("fIELD:"+$(this).data('field')); but it says undefined. any idea how?
[11:07:50] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: I json-encode the array and get the following attribute: data-zoom="["1","3"]"
[11:08:07] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: it is wrong
[11:08:12] <johnkpaul> us single quotes
[11:08:12] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: what can be done about this?
[11:08:26] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: and then it works? great
[11:08:32] <ravenzz> Advocated where? :p
[11:08:38] <VernonK> data-zoom="['1','3']"
[11:08:39] <antgel> VernonK: this is so weird.  i don't see my .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content rule in the debugger.  trying firefox as well (using chrome now)
[11:08:45] * antgel holds head in hands
[11:10:04] <VernonK> antgel: In Chrome Tools in the Resources panel do you see a reference to your CSS file and see that it was included and loaded correctly?
[11:10:12] <Advocated> ravenzz, sorry http://jsfiddle.net/dkTzt/
[11:11:04] <Doxin> I'm trying to get my head around the $.get function, but doing $.get("/api/is_logged_in/",login_view,'text') returns "function ( selector, context ) { // The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery ); }" as data, what gives?
[11:11:40] <antgel> VernonK: yep, it's there
[11:13:13] <ravenzz> Advocated console.debug($(this))  should tell you what is the issue
[11:13:20] <VernonK> Advocated:  In your case $(this) is a reference to the autocomplete widget itself.  this.element would be a reference to the actual element.  So this.element.data('field') will give you the placeholder.
[11:14:06] <VernonK> antgel: That is strange.  Is .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content your full selector?
[11:14:53] <VernonK> Advocated: Will probably give you only the set value unless you're updating the data-field value on keyup or something.
[11:15:01] <antgel> VernonK: hi, no, it's .ui-dialog .ui-dialog-content.ui-widget-content
[11:15:23] <antgel> VernonK: as of course ui-dialog-content is a child of ui-dialog
[11:15:38] <VernonK> antgel: Yeah, the selector looks fine.
[11:16:08] <Advocated> VernonK, that data attribute is set and will never changed
[11:16:25] <Advocated> ravenzz, that helped actually, i see where i'm going wrong now, its because it was working, i then added auto complete.
[11:16:33] <antgel> VernonK: i know, that's why i'm here :P
[11:16:41] <antgel> sorry, just very frustrated
[11:19:12] <muley> this weird case with quotes in the jquery form plugin is still driving me nuts: http://adam.cirkuit.net/ajax-quotes
[11:19:14] <VernonK> Advocated: If you want the value at that point you can do a this.element.val()
[11:19:44] <VernonK> antgel: Yeah, I get that.  I tested that selector against the UI dialog demo and it worked so there's something else strange going on here.
[11:22:15] <KevlarSoul> feyd I cant get the active to go back to normal when you click the other buttons
[11:22:45] <feyd> KevlarSoul: you may need to adjust the .parent() and .find() to match the new markup
[11:23:02] <feyd> KevlarSoul: .parent() will move you up 1 level in the HTML hierarchy
[11:23:25] <feyd> KevlarSoul: and the code needs to be at the parent of all the .buttons so it can select them all
[11:23:32] <KevlarSoul> it  http://semiaspa.com/index-1.html#Facials
[11:23:40] <KevlarSoul> it just stays active and the next activates
[11:23:49] <feyd> KevlarSoul: you should learn how to adjust the code to this
[11:23:56] <KevlarSoul> okay
[11:24:27] <feyd> KevlarSoul: where is your code anyway?
[11:24:46] <feyd> KevlarSoul: oatz.js is all the old code, it may be interfering
[11:25:10] <Italian_Plumber> Good afternoon.  I have a problem with a portion of my jquery that works for a while, then doesn't, until the user closes the browser and re-opens.  I've been unable to reproduce the problem, because the amount of time it takes for the problem to show up seems to be random.  Is there something obvious that I need to check?
[11:25:31] <KevlarSoul> feyd I adjusted it, its oatz.js you found it
[11:25:55] <VernonK> Italian_Plumber: Which portion?  Tied to an event?
[11:26:04] <VernonK> If so, what are you using to bind to the event?
[11:26:13] <kenneth> hey there. i'm having a visual glitch because js is not being executed fast enough. if you go to this page: http://kenneth.ballenegger.com/kswizztmp/# and scroll quickly, you'll see the header bar jump up for a little bit before it becomes fixed
[11:26:13] <kenneth> does anyone know how to get around that?
[11:27:14] <feyd> KevlarSoul: look at how the H6 is nested. how many parents does it have until you get to .wrapper?
[11:27:14] <Italian_Plumber> Vernonk: it's tied to an onchange event on a form textbox.  When the user puts in the zip code, it fires off an ajax request that looks up the city/state, adn fills it in.
[11:27:59] <KevlarSoul> feyd 2?
[11:28:17] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. Quick and easy question: What is the best way to determine what kind of value was passed to a function...i.e. (jquery object, generic object, string, array, etc.)
[11:28:37] <VernonK> Italian_Plumber: How are you binding to the event?
[11:28:37] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.type @ Whirl3d
[11:28:38] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.type(obj): Determine the internal JavaScript [[Class]] of an object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.type/
[11:28:47] <feyd> KevlarSoul: doing .parent().parent() would select the .box-imgs nav*, so we would have to do it 2 more times
[11:28:53] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: and for jquery objects, duck test the .jquery property
[11:29:02] <ajpiano> feyd: KevlarSoul use see ?closest
[11:29:03] <bot-t> feyd, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:29:06] <feyd> KevlarSoul: since we're doing it 4 times, it may be better to just select another element and do a .find() for it from that
[11:29:17] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, thanks. I wasn't sure if type worked everything. I'll check it out.
[11:29:27] <feyd> ajpiano: I forgot about that, thanks
[11:30:16] <KevlarSoul> feyd http://i.imgur.com/dH0Ti.png
[11:30:53] <KevlarSoul> oh
[11:31:36] <Italian_Plumber> Binding to the event?  I guess I don't know what that means.  (Somone else wrote this code)
[11:31:43] <KevlarSoul> closest
[11:31:50] <feyd> KevlarSoul: $(this).parent().find('.button > h6.active').removeClass('active'); - change that to $('.box-imgs h6.active').removeClass('active')
[11:32:21] <KevlarSoul> okay
[11:32:22] <feyd> KevlarSoul: the markup is more complicated, and all that line is doing is removing the .active from the active tab you have
[11:32:36] <MercuryTW> Is there any way to do something like a c-pointer in jQuery/JS? I need to write a callback that will modify a variable passed as a parameter
[11:32:39] <feyd> KevlarSoul: so we just target what we need to change, forget parent or closest
[11:32:48] <feyd> KevlarSoul: does that make sense?
[11:33:13] <KevlarSoul> You target it with the first class do you need to put a greater than sign?>"
[11:35:55] <KevlarSoul> feyd updated
[11:36:23] <VernonK> Italian_Plumber: So depending on the version of jQuery, it may be .bind, .live, .delegate, .on, .one
[11:36:56] <feyd> KevlarSoul: ok this works completely different than your example so a lot of this code has to change
[11:37:07] <Italian_Plumber> Thanks, VernonK.  I'll read up on that.  I'm not sure what any of that means.
[11:37:11] <VernonK> Italian_Plumber: It may be better to post the code somewhere or head to a forum so there can be a run through of the code itself.
[11:37:16] <KevlarSoul> feyd so the part where you put in '.box-imgs' needs to be the absolute parent, or top
[11:37:19] <Italian_Plumber> ah ok
[11:37:27] <feyd> KevlarSoul: forget what I said a couple minutes ago
[11:37:49] <VernonK> Italian_Plumber: Those references I mentioned are methods within jQuery to attach to an event.
[11:37:50] <eworbit> any jquery freelancers here?
[11:37:56] <KevlarSoul> feyd, thanks, Im sorry , I tried to simplify an example in jsfiddle because thats what people expect here...
[11:38:11] <KevlarSoul> but ultimately its not reeally representative of what I need, obviously
[11:38:26] <KevlarSoul> or rather, I did a poor job of representing my case in fiddle
[11:38:27] <feyd> KevlarSoul: change your css line 'h6.active ...' to 'box-imgs.active h6'
[11:38:43] <feyd> KevlarSoul: you did your fiddle right, its just that copying the code over wont work
[11:38:53] <KevlarSoul> okay
[11:40:14] <wroos> Hi all. I'm trying to use nestedsortable. Anybody here knows why this string doesn't work: order = $('ol.sortable').nestedSortable('toHierarchy'); but this: root_pages = []; $('ol.sortable').children('li').each(function(){ root_pages.push($(this).attr('id').replace('page_', '')); });
[11:40:49] <feyd> KevlarSoul: the line $(this).find('h6').addClass('active') - just remove the .find('h6') part out of that
[11:40:56] <feyd> KevlarSoul: and make that css change i mentioned above
[11:41:02] <KevlarSoul> okay
[11:41:17] <feyd> and change the $('.box-imgs h6.active') to $('.box-imgs .active')
[11:42:47] <KevlarSoul> okay
[11:44:02] <KevlarSoul> done
[11:44:32] <KevlarSoul> Well,
[11:44:33] <eworbit> wroos: instead of children(), maybe use find()
[11:45:21] <KevlarSoul> Why did you pick box-imgs ? just curious, I cant figure that out.
[11:45:37] <wroos> eworbit: Thanks for you're reply. Then I get all the results, but I can't see the order.
[11:45:48] <feyd> KevlarSoul: common class, the css I gave you is wrong though
[11:46:17] <feyd> KevlarSoul: do any of the boxes have a class that is specific to just them? i doubt if suffix_1 or grid_5 are just for those
[11:46:25] <feyd> KevlarSoul: but you're right, it shouldnt be that
[11:46:46] <feyd> KevlarSoul: but they need something to identify all of them at once, they have IDs but you should add a class to all of them that we can grab
[11:46:56] <KevlarSoul> hrmm
[11:47:29] <feyd> KevlarSoul: give them all another class, just for them. Like .sexyboxtab or something
[11:47:49] <eworbit> wroos: i dunno sorry
[11:47:52] <KevlarSoul> feyd I have the whole service menu in this: <div id="ServiceMenu" class="bg">
[11:48:03] <KevlarSoul> but bg is used elsewhere
[11:48:05] <KevlarSoul> I can do that
[11:48:10] <wroos> Thanks anyway.
[11:48:47] <bolero> hello, I have a short question on the 'on()' method. Can I use this for attaching toggle events? I found a roadmap for jquery that lists "live ('toggle', fn, fn)", but this doesn't work, either it was never added or was since removed. Is this support now somehow in on? Thanks!
[11:49:17] <KevlarSoul> feyd Im slow, so when you say "them" you mean the service sections? each section?
[11:49:58] <feyd> KevlarSoul: each box-img has a parent div that holds the image and the h6, thats what we want to target
[11:50:35] <feyd> KevlarSoul: grid_5.suffix_1.padtop3.col1 - none of those classes give them a unique identity, and they should have one
[11:51:09] <KevlarSoul> Ahh gotcah!
[11:51:18] <KevlarSoul> how about .feyd
[11:51:50] <feyd> KevlarSoul: .feydissocoolohmanjustlookathim
[11:52:38] <gnarf> bolero: see ?live
[11:52:38] <bot-t> bolero, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:52:56] <gnarf> bolero: however, .on is now preferred over all other event binding... see ?on
[11:52:56] <bot-t> bolero, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:53:24] <KevlarSoul> feyd :) added .feyd
[11:53:26] <gnarf> $( selector ).live( type, handler ) === $( document ).on( type, selector, handler )
[11:54:25] <KevlarSoul> i mean, it's an empty class, that doesnt matter right, were just using it as a target class to grab?
[11:55:00] <gnarf> bolero: also. "toggle" is just a specalized click
[11:55:14] <KevlarSoul> feyd so I change box-imgs to feyd
[11:55:15] <gnarf> you can reproduce it pretty easily
[11:55:20] <feyd> KevlarSoul: ok, now, change $(this).addClass('active'); to $(this).parent().addClass('active');
[11:55:28] <feyd> KevlarSoul: we're almost done, for real this time
[11:55:32] <KevlarSoul> k
[11:55:43] <bolero> I knopw what on is, but there is no description if I can use toggle with on. on('toggle', fn, fn) does not work.
[11:55:57] <feyd> KevlarSoul: $('.box-imgs .active').removeClass('active'); change to $('.feyd.active').removeClass('active');
[11:56:25] <feyd> KevlarSoul: and in css, change box-imgs.active h6 to .feyd.active h6
[11:56:31] <KevlarSoul> okay
[11:58:41] <KevlarSoul> OHH SHIT NIGGA!!!!
[11:58:47] <KevlarSoul> YOu did it, updated!
[11:59:15] <feyd> KevlarSoul: sorry that took so long. does it make sense to you now that it's setup correctly?
[11:59:16] <Whirl3d> I have a hard time determining the different goals of the different plugin development patterns. Does someone know of a good reference that explains when you want the plugin invocation to act like an object (such as $("sel").tab();) and when you want to just extend jquery to do something $("sel").align(props) ?
[11:59:34] <KevlarSoul> feyd interesting, so targetting the correct parent was the key
[11:59:56] <KevlarSoul> feyd, and creating a class to associate all together
[11:59:59] <KevlarSoul> altogether
[12:00:17] <gnarf> bolero: http://jsfiddle.net/YsCCw/ -- check that out
[12:00:24] <feyd> KevlarSoul: yes, we just had to make sure the structure was setup correctly
[12:00:36] <KevlarSoul> feyd, damn ur good.
[12:00:45] <KevlarSoul> feyd are you a comp sci major? self taught?
[12:00:53] <feyd> KevlarSoul: nah, if i was good it wouldnt have taken an hour
[12:01:14] <feyd> KevlarSoul: self taught, but i shouldnt even be speaking, I know so little of javascript it's laughable
[12:01:26] <KevlarSoul> feyd, I dunno, you did it without even seeing the source, were you firebugging?
[12:01:42] <KevlarSoul> Thats quite a bit better than me
[12:02:18] <gnarf> Whirl3d: preserve chain ability wherever possible.
[12:02:32] <gnarf> Whirl3d: other than that, its your plugin, do whatever the hell you want to with it :)
[12:03:35] <jacof> Why isn't log("test");  working in jsFiddle. Is there something I need to do for it to work ?
[12:04:21] <Whirl3d> gnarf, thanks for the reply. I guess I get confused. Sometimes you just extend $.fn.  but sometimes you use $.fn. for the reflexive ($(something).doPlugin) case but then use $.something(lst) to do objective case? and then some folks use heavy prototyping to make methods public.
[12:05:02] <starsinmypockets> I'm using jquery to  change background images of the slide controls on hover at tmm.toomodernmedia.com (portfolio.js). Is there a way to preload the image to avoid the flash on the first hover?
[12:05:10] <starsinmypockets> http://tmm.toomodernmedia.com
[12:05:15] <bolero> gnarf: thanks, I'll take a look.
[12:05:44] <gnarf> Whirl3d: if the thing operates on a collection of elements, it goes on $.fn -- if its just utility, $
[12:05:50] <Whirl3d> Some people namespace their methods (which looks conspicuously like making methods public $namespace.doSomething)  which is not the same as $namespace().doSomething but passes in some cases..
[12:06:14] <gnarf> Whirl3d: what difference does it make
[12:06:22] <zacharyrankin> hey guys, is the documentation accurate for .prop() because .attr('checked') does not seem to work in 1.7.1
[12:07:02] <gnarf> Whirl3d: because a purely theoretical discussion could be had - but you won't really learn anything from it... What it comes down to is method visibility, extension points, etc..
[12:07:06] <Whirl3d> To be honest, I am trying to learn to do this the correct way. I can kludge together anything at the moment, but that  doesn't make it nice or easy to get help with.
[12:07:33] <gnarf> Whirl3d: the same plugin can be written in 5 different patterns quite easily
[12:08:10] <gnarf> Whirl3d: if you can give me a practical use case / issue- i might be able to shed some light on my preferred method for dealing with it
[12:08:28] <Whirl3d> I'm learning that.  I guess, an article describing the pros/cons of several different pattens would be a great resource.
[12:08:34] <Whirl3d> yes, I would love your input. Thanks
[12:08:46] <Whirl3d> I am, for practice, doing a gallery
[12:09:06] <Whirl3d> and I can't decide if I should create subclasses for the controls or not
[12:09:24] <gnarf> define "controls"
[12:09:36] <Whirl3d> Next, Prev, Auto, Select buttons for example
[12:09:39] <gnarf> and also "subclasses"
[12:09:42] <bolero> gnarf: I don't understand that example. Should I use on('click', fn) instead of the console.log() commands?
[12:10:05] <gnarf> bolero: the example is just of the "makeToggle( fn, fn )"
[12:10:21] <gnarf> bolero: makeToggle( handler1, handler2 ) will return you a function which can be bound to a click
[12:10:24] <Whirl3d> In other words, should they be explicitly defined within the gallery plugin class or should they exist as separate plugins that look for a gallery object to update
[12:11:23] <Whirl3d> Should I set up listeners for the "changeSlide" custom event so that I can have all kinds of things update as they need to for the event or is it better to define the gallery to just explicitly update it's pieces?
[12:11:57] <gnarf> Whirl3d: surely, prev/next/etc buttons aren't even worthy of a "class" - the actual generation of each of those buttons is likely handled by a single function that injects the html and attaches listeners to point at methods on the gallery object
[12:12:23] <bolero> gnarf: I don't think this will work for me. Anyway, thanks!
[12:12:47] <gnarf> bolero: dude, it does EXACTLY what you wanted right?
[12:14:12] <gnarf> bolero: http://jsfiddle.net/YsCCw/1/
[12:14:46] <gnarf> Whirl3d: custom event is one possibility, not a horrible one either
[12:15:00] <Whirl3d> I just find myself having to do a lot of:   if  this kind of control exists, do this on update. over and over. And the more controls I add or the more things that respond, the longer (and more explicit the list gets). So by classing all the things that need to update on "changeSlide" for example, I can let the controls handle it rather than the gallery itself
[12:15:49] <Whirl3d> Thanks, btw, for this advice. I appreciate your input.
[12:15:53] <gnarf> Whirl3d: then maybe its worth refactoring it into its own function
[12:16:00] <someprimetime> wtf since when does jsfiddle have a firebug console built in?
[12:16:08] <someprimetime> have they always had that?
[12:16:10] <gnarf> someprimetime: firebug light
[12:16:22] <someprimetime> that's legit
[12:16:26] <gnarf> someprimetime: its been an option for a very long time on jQuery Edge
[12:16:42] <someprimetime> how do you enable it?
[12:16:43] <gnarf> someprimetime: you can include it via js on the resources page for any other versions as well
[12:16:50] <someprimetime> ah nice thx
[12:17:00] <bolero> gnarf: thanks for the hint. I'm currently rewriting to check if it works, thanks.
[12:17:34] <gnarf> someprimetime:   <script type="text/javascript" src="https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite-debug.js"></script>
[12:17:47] <someprimetime> gnarf++
[12:17:48] <someprimetime> thx
[12:18:45] <gnarf> bolero: there is one small issue with that that I could probably code around for you if you aren't up for it
[12:19:24] <gnarf> the toggle is "global" -- so like if you had two buttons, click on one, get fn1, click on the other get fn2, click on the other again for fn1, etc
[12:19:48] <arphen> with which function can i delete an object from an array by passing the object to the function?
[12:19:51] <gnarf> so in the event of a "delegation" (live) scenario - the "toggling" happens across the board
[12:20:03] <gnarf> arphen: none
[12:20:08] <gnarf> arphen: the one you write
[12:20:17] <gnarf> arphen: see ?inArray
[12:20:17] <bot-t> arphen, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[12:20:21] <gnarf> and
[12:20:28] <gnarf> ?mdc slice
[12:20:29] <bot-t> gnarf, slice - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a one-level deep copy of a portion of an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
[12:20:39] <gnarf> ?mdc splice
[12:20:39] <bot-t> gnarf, splice - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Changes the content of an array, adding new elements while removing old elements. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[12:21:20] <gnarf> arphen: at least i assume you meant like objects and arrays, not dom elements in a jquery set
[12:21:58] <arphen> ok :) thanks gnarf , its easy enough to write but i hate writing something myself and finding out later there was a convenvience wrapper for that anyway
[12:22:52] <fructose> Why might $('#foo' + id).children('.collapse') work in Firefox, but not IE9?
[12:27:21] <gnarf> bolero: http://jsfiddle.net/YsCCw/2/ -- Updated to work how I think you expected it to when attached to multiple buttons - also added some comments to the makeToggle function
[12:29:29] <gnarf> arphen: hm
[12:29:32] <gnarf> arphen: actually
[12:29:45] <gnarf> arphen: what is the structure of the array
[12:30:13] <gnarf> arphen: do you have arrays / undefined's in your array intentionally? because if not, you could easily use ?jQuery.map
[12:30:13] <bot-t> arphen, jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[12:31:05] <gnarf> ?js var o = {test:1}, a = ["a", "b", "c", o, "d"]; jQuery.map( a, function( v) { return v === o ? undefined : v; });
[12:31:07] <bot-t> gnarf: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
[12:31:15] <gnarf> arphen: ^^^^
[12:31:30] <gnarf> arphen: but jQuery.map will "flatten" returned arrays, so be careful
[12:32:04] <gnarf> ?js var o = {test:1}, a = ["a", "b", "c", o, ["d","e"]]; jQuery.map( a, function( v) { return v === o ? undefined : v; });
[12:32:04] <bot-t> gnarf: ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
[12:32:07] <gnarf> like that
[12:32:12] <gnarf> ?js var o = {test:1}, a = ["a", "b", "c", o, ["d","e"]]; jQuery.map( a, function( v) { return v === o ? undefined : [v]; });
[12:32:13] <bot-t> gnarf: ["a", "b", "c", ["d", "e"]]
[12:32:17] <gnarf> workaround ^^^
[12:40:50] <m1lt0n> hello. I'm facing a problem with IE. I am adding dynamically (creating and appending to the head of the document a stylesheet link) a stylesheet based on the change of a select box. I notice (in IE only) a different behaviour when the select box has a size attribute (which I prefer- specifically I set a size of 15). Specifically, I have used both change and click events on the select box and they are working great in all browsers but IE. In IE
[12:40:50] <m1lt0n> after I click on an option of the select box, nothing happens, until I mouse out of the select box. Any ideas?
[12:44:21] <bolero> gnarf: I think your code works, but one of the on events doesn't attach, although it should I think. I've modified the example: http://jsfiddle.net/YsCCw/3/ Click on Sort, that should alert 'A', click again, again 'A'. Now click "No Answers". Changes Sort to Sort Q and also changes the class. Click on Sort Q should now alert 'Q', but still alerts 'A'. So it seems, the on() for .sortQuestions doesn't attach after the the class was changed.
[12:45:47] <gnarf> bolero: thats because you attached the event handler to the object directly instead of using a delegated selector
[12:46:31] <gnarf> bolero: i wish i had time to explain delegation - maybe someone else can... also you should probably update maketoggle to be the makeToggle in  http://jsfiddle.net/YsCCw/2/
[12:47:07] <JoeyCadle> how do you find an element in the dom that has a specific data attribute. IE: <div data-related='1'></div> how would i find the div that has that data-related='1' with $.find()
[12:47:18] <mr_pinc> I have an element I am sliding from right to left - it works fine except that you can see the element when it is all the way to the right, I want it to be more of a masked effect - the element sliding into the viewport
[12:48:40] <bolero> gnarf: thanks, anyway. I know about another way. I just wanted to know if on() can now be used for toggle as toggle with live was supposed to be supported for 1.5.
[12:51:32] <b-lew> is there a reason why prettyPhoto is duplicating every item in my gallery? http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/#prettyPhoto[brian]/0/
[12:53:08] <here4thegear> I'm using $(window).unload(function(){}); as part of a marketing campaign. On a landing page for a product, if someone leaves the page, I want to perform an ajax call that updates the database... What page was the user on etc. The problem is, I don't want to do this if the way the unload was triggered was due to a refresh or due to pressing a certain button. Is there any way that I can capture how the unload was triggered?
[12:53:10] <b-lew> i'm not getting any errors?
[12:53:38] <jacof> lil' help with this one please: http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/yhv76/2/
[12:54:05] <gbhatnag> hi all, looking for a jQuery plugin for a subtly transitioning photo gallery like the one that appears here: http://elevenmadisonpark.com/
[12:54:21] <gbhatnag> any ideas?
[12:59:45] <Zzaichik> gbhatnag: for starters, that Action Script / Flash
[12:59:50] <Zzaichik> that's*
[13:00:09] <gbhatnag> right, I'm looking for a JS/HTML5/CSS3 solution
[13:00:38] <Zzaichik> BUT - google your brains out. I know there's TONS of of decent image carousels out there that utilize jQuery.
[13:00:50] <Zzaichik> I can't think of one in particular that has the exact effect as that one you showed
[13:01:16] <gbhatnag> ya, I've been searching, tough to find one that has that same level of flexibility and subtlety
[13:01:20] <gbhatnag> may have to roll my own :)
[13:02:15] <Zzaichik> yeah sorry. that's definitely quite the unique effect. Keep looking. And good luck!
[13:02:17] <Zzaichik> :)
[13:03:18] <monk12> quick question... Pretend i have an ajax app where it may load a new div randomly... i want to know when that div immediately loads so I can check its class and hide it. is there a way to do that smartly without using setTimout to check every .25seconds?
[13:05:21] <ph88_> why am i getting this error: $("#lists") is null    http://pastebin.com/XcSGedn3
[13:06:02] <Eviltwin> You're getting null?
[13:06:40] <jacof> ph88_ jQuery conflict maybe?
[13:07:18] <JoeyCadle> monk12, $.load('ajax.php', function(data) { $('#somediv').append(data).queue(function() { checkdivclassandhideit; $('#somediv').dequeue(); }); }); -- might work.
[13:08:27] <monk12> Thanks JoeyCadle , i'll look into queue functions
[13:08:36] <jacof> Eviltwin: This is about what we were talking about yesterday. http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/yhv76/2/ . Can you see why isn't running ?
[13:10:09] <JoeyCadle> ph88_, u prolly have something else i'd with #lists
[13:10:47] <Fidelix> How can I do something like $(this + ' .someclass').toggle(); ????
[13:11:41] <BillCriswell> The plugin I'm using to lazyload images isn't working very well in mobile Safari. It's like it waits to all visible images to load before it displays any of them. Is this common for lazyloaders?
[13:11:57] <bolero> gnarf: I read the part about delegated events in the the on() documentation. However, as soon as I add the selector I get an error. Isn't that correct: $('a').on('click', '.sortAnswers', toggleA);
[13:12:11] <gnarf> bolero: that also isn't correct
[13:12:24] <gnarf> with delegation you bind the actual event to some PARENT of the target element
[13:12:44] <gnarf> and it filters which ones call the handler by checking selector
[13:12:48] <JoeyCadle> bolero: ^^
[13:12:55] <bolero> gnarf: I hoped the a was a "parent" of the class of this element. I see.
[13:13:05] <gnarf> bolero: a.sortAnswers
[13:13:10] <gnarf> bolero: that is the SAME element
[13:13:20] <bolero> yeah.
[13:13:27] <gnarf> bolero: the obvious "parent" is "body"
[13:13:38] <jacof> http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/yhv76/3/ <- Any thoughts?
[13:13:59] <gnarf> but like if there is another parent before "body" that makes more sense, its a better place to bind
[13:16:21] <bolero> gnarf: Oh, great, with $('div').on('click', '.sortAnswers', toggleA);
[13:16:26] <bolero> it works
[13:17:28] <bolero> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/YsCCw/8/ Thanks a lot!!! I will also use a lot more of these delegated handlers from now on.
[13:17:47] <gnarf> bolero: thats probably not smart either
[13:17:52] <gnarf> cuz then thats attaching to every div
[13:18:07] <gnarf> target that shit with an ID selector or a class selector, its much smarter
[13:18:27] <bolero> gnarf: that's just for the sample. I'll atach it to a specific div.
[13:19:09] <bolero> gnarf: or, actually to a div with a certain class.
[13:20:43] <jacof> http://jsfiddle.net/jacof/yhv76/
[13:21:16] <Eviltwin> jacof: http://jsfiddle.net/yhv76/5/
[13:21:57] <jacof> did you just move var i = index++ outside of the if ?
[13:22:04] <Eviltwin> No, I changed a bunch of stuff
[13:22:05] <oojacoboo> jacof: how do you pronounce your name?
[13:22:11] <oojacoboo> is it like… jack-off ?
[13:22:20] <Eviltwin> For example, you can't do data.urls beacuse the data you passed was an array
[13:22:25] <jacof> you pronounce it how you like it
[13:22:32] <Eviltwin> So it's data[0] which I put in the var urls
[13:22:34] <ajpiano> oojacoboo: it's probably "jaco f."
[13:22:48] <oojacoboo> yea, that'd make more sense
[13:22:50] <jacof> Eviltwin, I had realized that and changed it after I pasted it
[13:22:58] <oojacoboo> just stands out since my name is Jacob
[13:22:59] <jacof> oojacoboo :)
[13:23:12] <Eviltwin> The other thing was the /echo/json/ stuff
[13:23:31] <Eviltwin> I went ahead and fixed that up
[13:23:36] <Eviltwin> That's only important for fiddles
[13:23:43] <jacof> Eviltwin Oh.
[13:24:03] <jacof> I guess I can take it from here then.

[13:26:48] <jacof> oojacoboo its not my name though. its a conjunction of my two last names.
[13:32:01] <bolero> gnarf: I moved the code in my production code and now see what you meant by the difference between using 'body' and 'div'. I just don't understand it. Is this an effect of event bubbling because there are more div parents, so I get an event each time it encoutners another div higher up?
[13:32:45] <gnarf> bolero: yes
[13:33:00] <bolero> gnarf: great, I've understood it now :-)

[13:36:04] <bolero> gnarf: what should I normally use? $('body').on('click', '.sortAnswers', toggleA); or something like $('span.colorGreen').on('click', '.sortAnswers', toggleA); (where span.colorGreen is the next parent and there won't be another parent like that) ?
[13:36:46] <grifx> Eviltwin: try
[13:36:55] <Eviltwin> bolero: The first means that it will run code on every click to see if the clicked thing matches the .sortAnswers selector
[13:36:55] <grifx> Eviltwin: You can't write message
[13:37:17] <bolero> so, the latter one is preferred for performance, right?
[13:37:18] <Eviltwin> The second means it will only run if the click was on or inside the span.colorGreen element
[13:37:28] <Eviltwin> Yes, as long as it still does what you need
[13:37:39] <Eviltwin> For example if you added a new span.colorGreen or something, it wouldn't apply to that one
[13:38:12] <bolero> understood, thanks.
[13:38:44] <Eviltwin> grifx: Try /JOIN ##mysql

[13:39:52] <Eviltwin> grifx: I want you to speak english
[13:40:01] <grifx> Eviltwin: LOL
[13:40:07] <arphen> how do i properly initialize jquerymobile widgets?
[13:40:22] <grifx> Eviltwin: I want to write something like : connect grifx password
[13:40:23] <arphen> if i try to call .listview() on a widget i get a "no property" error
[13:40:31] <Eviltwin> grifx: Try writing that
[13:40:34] <Eviltwin> See what happens
[13:40:43] <arphen> if i call .listview('refresh') i  get a "cant call method on uninitialized"
[13:40:46] <NoiseEee> grifx: you need to register your nickname to speak in ##mysql, do what ajpiano said
[13:41:17] <Eviltwin> grifx: Or make your own channel and wait for people to show up and help you

[13:43:05] <grifx> too hard for me
[13:43:12] <ajpiano> grifx: if it's too hard for you, we don't care.
[13:43:18] <grifx> ^^
[13:43:26] <grifx> sorry
[13:43:31] <ajpiano> that's how IRC works, you have to get the help from the bot, that's why it exists
[13:43:39] <ajpiano> and why the network help exists
[13:44:06] <snover> ajpiano: YOU’RE SO MEAN
[13:44:10] <PilotBob> I am trying to use autocomplete and I need to get the value of a field (fiscal year) and send it in the ajax request... however, it doesn't seem to be working. I assume because "this" is not the control that is being autocompleted?  https://gist.github.com/2230361
[13:44:14] <Eviltwin> So mean...
[13:47:42] <Eviltwin> PilotBob: I would try doing console.log(this); between lines 2 and 3 to see what that actually refers to
[13:49:05] <PilotBob> Eviltwin: is just shows LOG: [object Object]    :(
[13:49:20] <Eviltwin> PilotBob: console.log
[13:49:23] <Eviltwin> ?alert @ PilotBob
[13:49:23] <bot-t> PilotBob, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[13:49:52] <PilotBob> Eviltwin: that was a console.log result... of course from the evil IE devtools.
[13:50:15] <blez> is there an event if the DOM is changed
[13:50:26] <ravenzz> PilotBob try firebug lite
[13:51:06] <Eviltwin> blez: That's called a DOM Mutation Event and they are deprecated or removed from all browsers I'm aware of
[13:51:20] <Eviltwin> So short answer: No, not really
[13:51:25] <PilotBob> Eviltwin: chrome's console shows a.widget.a.(anonymous function).(anonymous function)
[13:51:49] <blez> Eviltwin http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844565/is-there-a-jquery-dom-change-listener
[13:51:56] <blez> that should work.
[13:52:04] <blez> but I wonder will it work if I move an element for example
[13:52:05] <Eviltwin> blez: That's called a DOM Mutation Event
[13:52:09] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[13:52:15] <Eviltwin> Or not existent in certain browser
[13:52:20] <Eviltwin> And thus should not be used
[13:52:42] <blez> is there a newer way?
[13:53:01] <Mosselman> hey guys. Does anyone know a good plugin for capturing keyboard events? I have been pretty pleased with jwerty, https://github.com/keithamus/jwerty but I was wondering if there is something that anyone could also really recommend
[13:53:31] <Eviltwin> blez: The problem is that it's insanely easy to create infinite loops of events if you do that
[13:53:39] <Eviltwin> Odds are your event listener will modify other elements
[13:53:46] <PilotBob> Eviltwin: firebug seems to show it is the element I expected... not sure why my selector doesn't work then... if I just type that with an id selector rather than "this" I get the value expected
[13:54:44] <ravenzz> ?newContent @ blez
[13:54:44] <bot-t> blez, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[13:55:13] <blez> yes, but I want an even that will fire even if I move an element
[13:55:23] <meowsus> If i have three clickable elements, what jQuery call can I use to see which one was clicked? It's kind of what i'd assume $(this).eq() would do, return the child position of the clicked element, but that's obviously not the function
[13:56:07] <ajpiano> meowsus: this ?
[13:56:16] <ajpiano> event.target ?
[13:57:27] <PilotBob> bot-t: yes.. that was output from IE dev tools console... I see fire bugs is much nicer. Pain haveing to support every browser each having their own tools.
[13:57:28] <bot-t> PilotBob, Stored "yes.. that was output from IE dev tools console... I see fire bugs".
[13:57:29] <feyd> ajpiano:  can I ask for your help again? I think this should be a straight forward fix, but it's baffling me
[13:58:30] <meowsus> ajpiano, what i'm saying is if i have three anchor tags, and a jquery selector select all three of them, with a click function. If someone clicks the second one, I want to know that the second one was chosen
[13:58:45] <meowsus> Instead of just writing three separate click functions
[13:58:52] <ajpiano> ohh
[13:58:58] <ajpiano> ?index
[13:58:58] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[13:59:11] <ajpiano> index with no args gives you element's position relative to its siblings
[13:59:29] <meowsus> WHAM
[13:59:31] <meowsus> Thanks man
[13:59:34] <ajpiano> also $("all the links").index(this) will also do it
[14:02:56] <feyd> ajpiano: nevermind, I had to convert something to an int
[14:03:08] <ajpiano> no prob
[14:03:43] <Mosselman> is there a way to only fire an event when a certain input field has focus? or should I just add and remove a class  on focus and on outfocus
[14:03:44] <Mosselman> ?
[14:04:03] <Mosselman> and then check if that field has that class when I do the keyevent?
[14:04:17] <jackfranklin> http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[14:04:29] <jackfranklin> Mosselman could you use that? $('input:focus").on("click", function() {});
[14:04:34] <jackfranklin> replacing "click" with whatever
[14:04:49] <jackfranklin> or there is a focus event
[14:05:09] <jackfranklin> $("input").on("focus", function() {});
[14:05:17] <jackfranklin> that's probably a simpler way
[14:05:21] <jackfranklin> Mosselman ^^
[14:05:24] <Mosselman> jackfranklin: of course, and then do   if $('input:focus').length > 0  etc?
[14:05:27] <samu> hi, can I seek help with jqueryui here too?
[14:05:57] <jackfranklin> why would you need to do that Mosselman ? I may have misunderstood
[14:06:21] <samu> So.. I've defined a jqueryui slider the normal way (and this will be the only code line that I'll paste):
[14:06:23] <Mosselman> jackfranklin: I don't need to launch something when it gets focus, but I need to catch the press of the [enter] button only when a certain field has focus.
[14:06:24] <samu> $( "#slider-document-count" ).slider({ max:5, min:1, range:'min', animate: true });
[14:06:34] <Mosselman> does that make sense?
[14:06:37] <samu> and then I've started to play around with it, to see how it works.
[14:06:45] <jackfranklin> if you use $("input").on("focus", fn() {}); then that will only fire when an input is focused; then you can use $(this) to get at the input that has focus
[14:06:46] <samu> So, I've made a 'slide' event to check the values.
[14:06:54] <samu> obviously, I should have values from 1 to 5
[14:06:59] <samu> but, which is akward
[14:07:08] <samu> I have values: 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
[14:07:15] <samu> not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, as expected...
[14:07:31] <samu> so, maybe I am doing something wrong, but perhaps somebody could tell me what might that be?
[14:07:56] <Mosselman> jackfranklin: thanks :) I will try that out
[14:08:06] <samu> and that's my first experience with jqueryui, so i might make stupid mistakes. also, please tell me if this isn't the proper channel to ask about jqueryui.
[14:11:53] <jackfranklin> ah I see Mosselman , apologies
[14:11:53] <jackfranklin> so you should do an onkeydown event I guess, then see if $("input:focus").length is true ?
[14:11:53] <jackfranklin> as you said, in fact, sorry I didn't quite understand what you meant initially :P
[14:12:58] <Mosselman> jackfranklin: sorry my bad :)
[14:13:18] <Mosselman> jackfranklin:  so yeah, I guessed that if length is >0 I would only then allow the event to go through
[14:14:03] <jackfranklin> yeah Mosselman except in the if you can just do if ( $("blah").length ) {}
[14:14:06] <Mosselman> so    jwerty('enter', function(){  if(jQuery('#certainInput:focus').length > 0){ do it}  });
[14:14:06] <jackfranklin> you dont need to do > 0
[14:14:17] <jackfranklin> yeah that looks about right
[14:14:17] <Mosselman> jackfranklin: alright
[14:18:38] <samu> okay, scratch my question, I was incorrectly getting the current value from a slide effect.
[14:20:48] <ph88_> why am i getting this error in firebug: $("#lists") is null    http://pastebin.com/XcSGedn3
[14:23:20] <dancinllama> are there any issues with the append() and firefox?  when i call append('<...>') on a div element, it removes all the html from it then appends my html
[14:23:29] <dancinllama> works fine in safari, not so much in ff
[14:24:29] <Eviltwin> dancinllama: Make a jsFiddle example
[14:36:37] <Nomikos> Anyone know, if I create a variable inside the $(function(){ .. wrapper thingers, how I can reference that from outside them?
[14:39:45] <zardo> Hi. I'm looking for a alternative to the "> elem" selector (which is marked deprecated) w/o chaining the children()-method multiple times. I want to select "ul > li > elem" but not "ul > li > ul > li > elem".
[14:42:17] <Zzaichik> :first
[14:42:23] <Zzaichik> ...wait
[14:42:42] <Zzaichik> Yeah
[14:43:52] <Zzaichik> :first-child might be what you're looking for
[14:46:13] <shoky> how is that what he's looking for
[14:46:23] <zardo> No,  that's not what I'm looking for.
[14:46:42] <shoky> why would that selector be deprecated :\
[14:48:04] <zardo> I have no idea,  but the docs say so: "Note: The $("> elem", context) selector will be deprecated in a future release."
[14:48:22] <shoky> yah
[14:48:56] <shoky> hmm i donno of another way without .children()
[14:49:40] <Eviltwin> $("> elem", context) runs $(context).find("> elem")
[14:49:48] <Eviltwin> Use that syntax instead
[14:49:54] <Eviltwin> Or .children("elem")
[14:50:42] <zardo> So the "> elem" selector alone is not deprecated? Then I missunderstood the docs.
[14:51:19] <shoky> nothing's deprecated yet, anyway
[14:51:44] <Eviltwin> I highly doubt the "> elem" selector is deprecated
[14:51:52] <Eviltwin> Or would be
[14:52:00] <Eviltwin> It wouldn't make sense to deprecate it
[14:52:13] <zardo> ok, ty.
[14:52:31] <Eviltwin> Where as $("> elem", context) was just for laziness
[14:56:31] <Nomikos> Is there any way to access variables defined inside $(function(){ .. }); ?
[14:56:56] <Eviltwin> Nomikos: No
[14:57:09] <Eviltwin> Not unless they're put in outside variables
[14:57:16] <Eviltwin> Explicitly
[14:57:30] <Nomikos> bummer
[14:57:50] <Eviltwin> Not really
[14:58:50] <_d4rklit3> is there a way to create custom events with jquery
[14:59:10] <Eviltwin> _d4rklit3: Yes
[14:59:12] <_d4rklit3> for example i have an array of javascript objects  (Prototype.icon)
[14:59:58] <_d4rklit3> everytime some1 clicks on the icon i want to trigger an event that the parent of the array will do something about
[15:00:14] <Shapeshifter> Does someone have an idea what is going wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/hyq5b/ Simple case of wrap()ing a clone of a <body> element in an <html> element. But the wrap only seems to work if the html element doesn't contain a namespace (i.e. b.wrap('<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" />') fails.
[15:00:27] <_d4rklit3> likc i have a      openLightBox: function () {} in my VideoIcon object
[15:00:30] <Eviltwin> _d4rklit3: Why not just do it with the click event?
[15:00:51] <_d4rklit3> because the object itself is not an element
[15:00:57] <_d4rklit3> it just contains a reference to the element
[15:01:05] <_d4rklit3> so i want to listen for an event from the object
[15:01:09] <_d4rklit3> not from the element
[15:01:16] <Shapeshifter> uh, sorry
[15:01:19] <Shapeshifter> http://jsfiddle.net/hyq5b/1/ I mean.
[15:03:52] <Eviltwin> _d4rklit3: Okay, there are two things you can do
[15:04:15] <_d4rklit3> sure
[15:04:15] <Eviltwin> One is to yourObject.events = $();
[15:04:32] <Eviltwin> Then yourObject.events.on("youreventname", function() { ... })
[15:04:42] <Eviltwin> And yourObject.events.trigger("youreventname")
[15:04:46] <_d4rklit3> ok
[15:04:50] <_d4rklit3> will that work in ie7?
[15:04:59] <_d4rklit3> that seems doable
[15:05:05] <Eviltwin> The other is to do $(yourObject).on("youreventname", function() { ... })
[15:05:15] <Eviltwin> And $(yourObject).trigger("youreventname")
[15:05:21] <Eviltwin> Yeah, should work fine in all major browsers
[15:07:29] <Eviltwin> Actually
[15:07:31] <Eviltwin> I may have lied
[15:07:43] <_d4rklit3> about what?
[15:07:50] <Eviltwin> For that first one, I think you need to do yourObject.events = $({});
[15:07:55] <Zzaichik> I totally lied a minute ago so don't feel bad
[15:08:01] <arphen> is there any way i can navigate to a certain element in a nested list in jquerymobile?
[15:08:02] <_d4rklit3> i lie all the time
[15:08:03] <_d4rklit3> heh
[15:09:05] <_d4rklit3> im going to start using coffeescript soon
[15:09:07] <_d4rklit3> that should be fun
[15:09:55] <arphen> is there any default action bound to the submit button of forms?
[15:10:19] <zardo> @Shapeshifter: I don't know why it makes a difference but http://jsfiddle.net/AdD2a/3/ seems to work.
[15:11:33] <Eviltwin> arphen: The default action of submit buttons is to submit the form
[15:11:58] <Shapeshifter> Eviltwin: yes, that's a way to do it. Thanks. I wonder if it's a bug to be reported, though.
[15:12:05] <Shapeshifter> or if I'm doing something wrong
[15:13:03] <Shapeshifter> zardo: ^
[15:13:11] <b-lew> Anyone know if it is possible for fancybox to have images and videos in the same gallery? right now when I try to do it my videos are blank and aren't showing up… Been trying to fix it all day.
[15:13:17] <paul_p_75> Hi there. I have a website at http://www.accommodationbarossavalley.com.au/ which when searching the area all - in ie it will return nothing via .post or with .ajax call. Works without issues in ff and chrome, but in ie we the debugger says (aborted). has anyone come across this issue in the past, and have a way around it? Its grabbing a lot of data which is output in html.
[15:13:45] <arphen> Eviltwin, thing is when i hit submit jquerymobile will also dissolve my current "dialog" page and go back to the root of the deeply nested list the "dialog page" was created from
[15:14:43] <Eviltwin> arphen: Are you preventing the default action?
[15:14:53] <arphen> 93.135.112.175/home/Mobile/ please log in as peter//peter choose "technische mechanik" and then really anything until you answer a question, when you submit the solution it goes back to the root instead of going 1 step back
[15:14:55] <arphen> yes
[15:15:09] <arphen> i did funcction(event){event.preventdefault()}
[15:15:23] <Eviltwin> It's event.preventDefault();
[15:15:27] <arphen> yes...
[15:15:35] <Eviltwin> The first will not work
[15:15:39] <Eviltwin> It's an important distinction
[15:15:53] <arphen> yes thank you for remarking, in the original code it's correct
[15:16:24] <arphen> it will not revert to the root of the website, but it will go back to the root of the nested list the dialog was created from
[15:16:34] <arphen> what i'd like it to do is just do "one step back"
[15:17:14] <arphen> if i kill the dialog manually it works like i want it to
[15:17:55] <_d4rklit3> another question, how do i make it so when i click an object it doesn't fire off 9 events
[15:18:03] <_d4rklit3> there are 9 icosn
[15:18:09] <_d4rklit3> oops brb
[15:20:58] <arphen> Eviltwin,  i will just make a quick and dirty hack, :) thanks anyway
[15:22:44] <arphen> thanks for spending so much time here answering questions Eviltwin
[15:23:01] <arphen> i don't know how i would have learned to code without people like you with unlimited patience
[15:23:19] <Eviltwin> I try to help out where I can
[15:24:07] <Eviltwin> Some people don't appreciate my help because I tend to guide poeple in a way that forces them to figure things out rather than just tell them the answer.
[15:26:32] <_d4rklit3> ok yeah
[15:26:37] <_d4rklit3> so i have 9 of these objects
[15:26:46] <_d4rklit3> when i click on one, it fires the event 9 times
[15:27:20] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ _d4rklit3
[15:27:20] <bot-t> _d4rklit3, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:27:27] <someprimetime> i like Eviltwin's approach
[15:27:30] <someprimetime> opened my eyes up a lot
[15:27:32] <_d4rklit3> man....
[15:27:41] <someprimetime> and my wallet
[15:27:47] <someprimetime> he robbed me blind
[15:27:59] <b-lew> I can send a link if anyone is willing to help
[15:28:06] <someprimetime> yo @Eviltwin SFJS hack night @ IGN vs Fast HTML5 web UIs for every device.. which would you pick?
[15:28:12] <someprimetime> i accidentally signed up for both
[15:28:21] <someprimetime> so i need to cancel an RSVP before tomorrow for one of them
[15:28:35] <_d4rklit3> i figured it out
[15:28:55] <someprimetime> i'm leaning toward the hack night since it's only 60 people vs. 300 and it's a block away from my work instead of 8 blocks away
[15:28:57] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I would probably pick SFJS hack night but I don't know.
[15:28:59] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[15:29:08] <_d4rklit3> i was assigning events: $({}) i  like event: $({}), morevalues: etc
[15:29:13] <_d4rklit3> where it should be assigned in the initialize
[15:29:18] <someprimetime> sounds good.
[15:29:54] <MagmaRules> Hi there, anyone knows how to accomplish the same as "accept" from droppables but in sortables? Adding a droppable with accept doesn't work from my tests.
[15:31:16] <KevlarSoul> Is hoverintent a must for superfish menus?
[15:31:59] <KevlarSoul> I like the way it works, just curious if you guys had any thoughts?
[15:39:41] <Moult> i have an image that uses an areamap. the <area> has an onclick element executing a javascript function. how can i send the id of specific image that triggered the onclick?
[15:41:01] <K3|Chris> people still use image maps?
[15:41:19] <Eviltwin> People still use JavaScript?
[15:41:23] <Eviltwin> I thought that died
[15:41:28] <Moult> K3|Chris: yes, if you want to have an irregular shaped link target
[15:41:44] <_d4rklit3> how do i make it so what i click on doesn't propogate
[15:41:49] <_d4rklit3> to its children or parent
[15:41:53] <Eviltwin> _d4rklit3: You stop propagation
[15:41:58] <_d4rklit3> what abot for ie
[15:42:00] <_d4rklit3> ?
[15:42:09] <Eviltwin> You cancelBubble
[15:42:23] <Eviltwin> But that's all handled by stopPropagation in jQuery
[15:42:45] <_d4rklit3> ie7
[15:42:47] <_d4rklit3> throws error
[15:42:55] <_d4rklit3> no such property stopPropagation
[15:43:10] <Eviltwin> Then you're calling it on the wrong thing or using a non-jQuery event
[15:43:37] <_d4rklit3> .click
[15:43:40] <_d4rklit3> i shit you not
[15:44:08] <Eviltwin> You have a special talent for not providing enough information to help us help you diagnose
[15:44:16] <_d4rklit3> lol
[15:44:21] <_d4rklit3> now it works.. thats weird
[15:45:18] <_d4rklit3> i mean what can i say?
[15:45:36] <_d4rklit3> its hard to pastebin complex projects
[15:46:45] <Eviltwin> But I'm not asking you to pastebin a whole project
[15:46:51] <Eviltwin> What you've been asking about is much more specific
[15:47:16] <Eviltwin> Ask about the specifics, use jsFiddle to show us what's not working
[15:47:50] <meowsus> At the beginning of my code I set the REL attribute on two elements, and I see it working, but later in my code when I try to cycle through those elements and get the REL attribute with $(this).attr('rel') it comes back as undefined... when it's clearly defined... any ideas?
[15:48:53] <Eviltwin> meowsus: Maybe "this" doesn't refer to what you think it does
[15:49:12] <meowsus> Evil
[15:49:14] <meowsus> whoops
[15:49:15] <Eviltwin> Use console.log to see what it does refer to
[15:49:22] <meowsus> Eviltwin, I'm doing that
[15:49:39] <meowsus> I can get $(this).attr('style') and $(this).attr('class') just fine, but it hates REL for some reason
[15:50:42] <meowsus> Whoops, it was a timing issue
[15:51:02] <meowsus> The latter part of the code was being executed before the former, because I was using the imageLoaded plugin
[15:51:18] * meowsus cuddles his large trout
[15:53:17] <Joe_S> Hey I am trying to write a little function that automatically resizing a div as set intervals, this is what I have so far:
[15:53:27] <eph3meral> how do I get the list of unchecked radio buttons?
[15:53:30] <Joe_S> var autoHeight = setInterval(function() {$("#content-wrap").height(content_height);}, 2500);
[15:53:35] <eph3meral> I know how to get the one that's checked, via http://stackoverflow.com/questions/596351/how-can-i-get-which-radio-is-selected-via-jquery
[15:53:41] <eph3meral> but how would I get the one that's not checked?
[15:53:55] <Joe_S> but it doesn't seem to be working, does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?
[15:53:58] <eph3meral> and or how would I specifically check IF a given radio button is checked?
[15:54:14] <Eviltwin> $("input[type=radio]:not(:checked)")
[15:54:22] <Joe_S> resizes*
[15:54:23] <eph3meral> Eviltwin, cool thanks
[15:58:00] <dystopi> anyone willing to help me with some odd tablesorter.js behaviour?
[15:58:16] <Eviltwin> From what I can tell, everything about tablesorter is odd behavior
[15:58:25] <dystopi> ;_;
[15:58:30] <sente> dystopi: what's up?
[15:59:20] <dystopi> whenever i click on a th, it changes the class twice, headerSortUp and headerSortDown instead of just toggling
[16:01:14] <dystopi> even if i specify a column to be sorted ASC, it's like clicking on the header toggles it twice
[16:02:45] <KevlarSoul> HOeverintent only needed for menus with drop downs?
[16:03:35] <Eviltwin> KevlarSoul: It's explained here: http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[16:06:39] <dystopi> omg, nvm, i was initializing tablesorter twice on the id, so there were two click handlers running right after anothr
[16:06:45] <dystopi> i am so smrt ._.
[16:06:53] <shadykhan> im ajaxing a page in but im also using a lightbox plugin but it wont load thru the ajax paged
[16:07:02] <Eviltwin> dystopi: I was going to suggest that
[16:07:30] <dystopi> thx, eviltwin. btw, modeselektor made a song after your nick ;)
[16:07:36] <simtsit> I'd lov to crate a JS slideshow. any tip where to start from? thnx
[16:26:58] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: what's your take on qunit?
[16:27:00] <someprimetime> http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit
[16:27:29] <someprimetime> or anyone else for that matter
[16:27:38] <Eviltwin> I think unit tests are extremely valuable
[16:27:47] <Eviltwin> Especially for large projects
[16:27:55] <Eviltwin> But I've never used QUnit
[16:28:07] <Eviltwin> And haven't looked much at unit testing in JavaScript
[16:28:38] <Eviltwin> I'll be using nodeunit for a project I'm starting in a week or two
[16:28:39] <Eviltwin> https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit
[16:32:47] <someprimetime> word thanks
[16:33:10] <someprimetime> you using node a lot these days?
[16:33:16] <someprimetime> i played around with it last weekend
[16:33:24] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I played around with it maybe a year ago
[16:33:32] <Eviltwin> Decided I wanted to get more familiar with it
[16:33:35] <someprimetime> http://helloparker.cloudapp.net (it's on windows azure so it's slow as hell.. just wait for the prompt)
[16:33:36] <endberg> hi
[16:33:38] <Eviltwin> And a project I had in mind is perfect for it
[16:33:48] <someprimetime> type "fact" for a cat fact :o
[16:34:04] <someprimetime> that was for a hackathon which i threw together in like 20 min after spending over 3hours working on a snake game
[16:34:16] <Eviltwin> Ha, nice
[16:34:20] <endberg> I have a (probably syntax) problem: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7xBG/1/  please, correct me!
[16:34:22] <someprimetime> i'm going to the same hackathon next month and am going to finish up what i started and enter it
[16:37:17] <KevlarSoul> Thanks Eviltwin
[16:38:01] <Eviltwin> endberg: Don't see a syntax error
[16:38:07] <jtomasrl> if i have a variable that contains many DOMs, how can i do over everyone one by one
[16:38:45] <toothr> 'if i have a variable that contains many DOMs'... huh?
[16:39:10] <jtomasrl> PinnedIdea = $(".pinned-idea") and i have many pinned-idea divs
[16:39:18] <endberg> Eviltwin: jslint says: Problem at line 1 character 39: Expected ')' and instead saw ':'.
[16:39:45] <toothr> jtomasrl, .each() ?
[16:40:07] <jtomasrl> toothr nice thx
[16:40:13] <Eviltwin> endberg: You could do $('div.cItem').eq(itemcounter).toggleClass('selected');
[16:46:08] <Whirl3d> if you animate an object with queue:false, can you stop it using .stop?
[16:46:20] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure
[16:46:22] <Eviltwin> Perhaps not
[16:47:00] <Whirl3d> thanks for the reply. I'll try it out and report back. It'll be a while though.
[16:47:01] <Eviltwin> Looks like maybe not
[16:47:08] <Eviltwin> From the source
[16:48:32] <Whirl3d> okay, well what about this: if you are animating using relative parameters {left:"-=20px'}  will  animate figure out right even if you don't have a right css position paramter?
[16:49:08] <Eviltwin> I believe it calculates it based on inner{Height,Width}
[16:49:10] <Eviltwin> Etc
[16:49:49] <Whirl3d> why is queue the default behavior?
[16:49:56] <CrazyZurfer> hello
[16:50:08] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Why wouldn't it be?
[16:50:16] <Eviltwin> Or why shouldn't it be?
[16:50:38] <Whirl3d> I think that queue is nice, but I wouldn't have expected it to automatically queue for me.
[16:51:10] <CrazyZurfer> or better... any way to work with the DOM?
[16:51:14] <Eviltwin> The goal is to make it as easy as possible to have a series of animations happen serially on an object
[16:51:15] <CrazyZurfer> is there any way to execute a script that is loaded by the function .load()?
[16:51:44] <Eviltwin> And to also make things like .hover(function() { /* animate expand */ } , funciton() { /* animate collapse */ }) work relatively cleanly
[16:51:45] <Whirl3d> Have you ever seen the Fuse library for actionscript. It's really a great great library (for as2.0), but I would love to see it converter to jquery. I don't think I have the skillz, but it would be nice to handle things the way they do.
[16:52:34] <Whirl3d> I can see thhat logic, but isn't it ironic that hover, precisely, causes problems for the quueue?
[16:52:41] <CrazyZurfer_> ?? any way?
[16:52:55] <Whirl3d> ?loadScript
[16:52:57] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery.getScript() - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[16:53:12] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: If the animations didn't queue, that's freak out if the animation didn't finish when the other animation started
[16:53:17] <Eviltwin> Or the other call to .animate happened
[16:53:40] <Eviltwin> As it is the first animation will finish and the next one will start right away
[16:53:53] <Eviltwin> Or if the first animation already finished, the second will start when you call .animate
[16:54:06] <Whirl3d> I hear ya. The way Fuze handles it is to recalculate the end parameters and re-apply the animation.
[16:54:10] <endberg> thanks its good now
[16:54:15] <endberg> bye
[16:54:38] <Whirl3d> so that way, if you said animate opacity to 0, then animate to 50 then 40 it would end up animating to 40 from wherever it was
[16:54:57] <Whirl3d> right now it has to go from 0 to 50 to 40.... not a great example, but you get my point
[16:55:21] <CrazyZurfer_> is there anyway to work with the DOM?, because $(document).ready() doesn't seem to work with the DOM
[16:55:32] <CrazyZurfer_> doesn't affect the DOM
[16:56:03] <CrazyZurfer> :)
[17:01:31] <CrazyZurfer> ??
[17:04:30] <Whirl3d> what areyou trying to do CrazyZurfer?
[17:06:29] <CrazyZurfer> well... i've a document, then i click a button and i bring a form by using .load()
[17:06:57] <CrazyZurfer> then i want to click on the button of the form and send the information to another php
[17:07:37] <CrazyZurfer> but i dont find the way to use that button from the 2nd file... $(".button").click() doesn't work
[17:07:38] <Whirl3d> and...
[17:07:50] <Whirl3d> You have to select THAT button
[17:07:59] <Whirl3d> or have a click handler assigned with .on
[17:08:00] <CrazyZurfer> i guess is because that button (and form) is in the DOM
[17:08:16] <CrazyZurfer> don't understand
[17:08:18] <CrazyZurfer> sorry
[17:09:10] <Whirl3d> so, when you load the form into a div, you setup an "on handler" like this:   $("holderdiv").on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); if (targ.is(".submitbutton") { do stuff});});
[17:09:42] <Whirl3d> then, when the button on the loaded form is clicked, it naturally bubbles up and the event gets passed to the holder div with (e.target) telling you what was clicked
[17:11:38] <CrazyZurfer> what im doing... i've a form in a html file... $("#form").submit(function(){ $("#result").load("page2.php" , { parameter1: "the input value" }); })
[17:12:27] <CrazyZurfer> in the same file i've $("#button").click( function () { //send info using .load() });
[17:12:36] <CrazyZurfer> and the page2.php has the new form
[17:12:39] <CrazyZurfer> is that ok?
[17:12:42] <CrazyZurfer> doesn't work
[17:12:43] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[17:13:15] <Whirl3d> do you have two buttons labeled with the id "button" ....only one element can have a id.
[17:13:22] <CrazyZurfer> when i say.. doesn't work.. i mean.. nothing happens when i click #button
[17:13:38] <CrazyZurfer> only one is labeled as "button"
[17:15:12] <Whirl3d> but here's the thing. When the first page loads (without the form), there is no #button to bind a click event to. So it fails silently.
[17:15:15] <CrazyZurfer> have a look: http://190.160.214.85/promedio/
[17:15:31] <CrazyZurfer> you have to submit nubers
[17:16:14] <coldhead> nubians?
[17:17:47] <CrazyZurfer> did you see it?
[17:18:36] <coldhead> no te has eximido todavía, dime tu nota de exámen
[17:19:01] <CrazyZurfer> that means that you have to input the exam test to see if you aprove
[17:19:11] <coldhead> "you have not yet relieved, tell me your note of examination"
[17:19:12] <CrazyZurfer> "approve"
[17:19:26] <coldhead> it knows me better than i know myself
[17:19:45] <CrazyZurfer> if you have an average of 5 or higer, you approve the subject
[17:19:51] <CrazyZurfer> if not.. it asks for the exam grade
[17:20:33] <CrazyZurfer> and then again... if the weighted score is higher than 5, you approve.. if not.. you are dead xD
[17:22:50] <CrazyZurfer> so... any idea??
[17:23:02] <Chopps> hey guys, i want to display an alert or dialog showing an image, any idea how can i do that?
[17:23:19] <eframson> Hi, quick question. I'm trying to dynamically set the selected option of a select element based on something in the page URL. I'm using $("#my_element").val("my_option"), which is properly setting which element is selected. However, in the browser, the option that is displayed in the select's default state is still just the first option in the list. 1) does this make sense so far? and 2) is there a way of letting the select know its value has changed and
[17:23:19] <eframson> it should display the new option instead? (Chrome, Mac is my environment)
[17:25:12] <coldhead> ?modal @ Chopps
[17:25:12] <bot-t> Chopps, There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[17:25:21] <CrazyZurfer> Whirl3d: any idea :D!
[17:26:11] <Whirl3d> sorry, taco bell was just delivered and i had to eat or pass out  gimme a min
[17:29:17] <coldhead> eframson: http://jsfiddle.net/2A5LY/2/
[17:29:22] <coldhead> what you described should Just Work
[17:30:43] <eframson> Yeah, I would think so too. It could be a browser thing, I guess. Like, when I click on the select to expand the options, it shows the correct one is selected. However, when I click off the element and it goes back to its non-listing state, all that's displayed is the first element in the list
[17:30:59] <Chopps> thanks coldhead i used jquery ui dialogs :D
[17:33:05] <coldhead> you got this online somewhere eframson ?
[17:34:57] <eframson> coldhead: I don't. It's part of a larger company system, so unfortunately it's difficult to isolate just the bits I'm working on for online reproduction. I just got an idea though! Two seconds...
[17:38:55] <CrazyZurfer> fixed
[17:40:08] <eframson> coldhead: After setting the value manually, I went ahead and did a $("my_select").change()
[17:41:08] <eframson> And the browser then figured it out
[17:41:28] <coldhead> great work, eframson
[17:41:32] <coldhead> everyone take 5
[17:49:20] <TheyCallMeBruce> after using .serialize() can i pick specific parts of the string?
[17:54:06] <paul_p_75> Hi there. I have a website at http://www.accommodationbarossavalley.com.au/ which when searching the area all - in ie it will return nothing via .post or with .ajax call. Works without issues in ff and chrome, but in ie we the debugger says (aborted). has anyone come across this issue in the past, and have a way around it? Its grabbing a lot of data which is output in html.
[18:00:59] <jrockjiggz> ?demo @ paul_p_75
[18:01:00] <bot-t> paul_p_75, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:04:20] <paul_p_75> The website is http://www.accommodationbarossavalley.com.au/ when doing a search on any date, with areas set to All in internet explorer(i've tried 9,8 and 7), it will give a blank response the debugger in ie says (aborted) as the status after between 14 to 18 seconds. When doing it in firefox or chrome with same selections we get correct results.
[18:04:45] <paul_p_75> sorry thats in the search accommodation search box on the top left
[18:04:53] <paul_p_75> thanks
[18:05:36] <jrockjiggz> it would be easier to re-create the issue in jsfiddle...
[18:06:43] <paul_p_75> ok thanks. i will take a look on jsfiddle. thanks

[18:54:35] <solidus-river> i have html as a string that i want to append to a list but it gets treated as text and not html
[18:54:54] <solidus-river> is there a way around this? i'm using $("ul").append("string_of_html")
[18:55:30] <coldhead> that should be treated as html
[18:55:47] <coldhead> is there something funny about the html?
[18:55:51] <solidus-river> oh i see whats happening, rails is turning < int &gt;

[19:07:11] <anth0ny> is it better to declare "var x = $('#someDiv')" and reference "x" in a script than repeatedly referencing "$('#someDiv')" or is it the same in terms of computing time?
[19:07:32] <ajpiano> it's infinitely better to do the former
[19:07:40] <anth0ny> ajpiano: gotcha, thanks
[19:15:51] <coldhead> infinitely
[19:33:31] <Amnesi4c> I am using the $.contains method...
[19:33:39] <Amnesi4c> It doesn't work as I expected it to.
[19:33:50] <Amnesi4c> Ut returns true even after removing an element.
[19:33:52] <Amnesi4c> http://jsfiddle.net/Amnesiac/wMvCQ/1/
[19:34:35] <Amnesi4c> Can anyone please help?
[19:35:05] <coldhead> i don't see you using contains() here
[19:38:31] <Amnesi4c> Dont you see it within the console.log?
[19:38:50] <Amnesi4c> line number 13
[19:40:26] <quuxman> how do I get a list of classes?
[19:41:04] <quuxman> What I'm trying to do is generate a selector to match every element with the same classes of a given element
[19:41:05] <beancurd> list of all classes within a document?
[19:41:34] <Eviltwin> quuxman: Why?
[19:42:10] <quuxman> something like: '.' + e.attr('class').split(' ').join('.')
[19:42:28] <quuxman> that's not very clean though. If there's an extra space in the class attribute it fucks it up
[19:42:50] <quuxman> though jquery seems to parse out extra '.'s
[19:42:52] <Eviltwin> quuxman: e.attr("class").trim().replace(/ +/, ".")
[19:43:49] <Amnesi4c> coldhead, do you see contains in the fiddle?
[19:44:08] <quuxman> to answer why, I have several of the same button that performs an asynchronous action, and the button gives feedback based on the server's response
[19:44:18] <quuxman> I want all of the buttons to be updated
[19:44:21] <abjorn> :o
[19:45:24] <quuxman> so each button has the record's id it acts upon as a class, so I can easily select all the buttons that act on the same record
[19:45:56] <quuxman> however, there's a better way to do this. I can simply pass the record's id directly to the JavaScript function
[19:46:07] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:47:00] <ajpiano> Amnesi4c: you have to pass DOM elements, not jQuery objects, to jQuery.contains, btw
[19:48:46] <mkutub> hi
[19:49:40] <sammmy> var text = "..."; text.replace(/\n/g, '<br>').replace(/\s/g, '&nbsp;'); $elem.html(text);  I want to escape the contents of text before I convert the \n and \s characters. Solution?
[19:50:09] <Amnesi4c> coldhead,  How do I get a domElement from the jquery object?
[19:50:09] <Eviltwin> sammmy: HTML escape?
[19:50:18] <Eviltwin> Amnesi4c: .get(n) or [n]
[19:50:22] <ajpiano> Amnesi4c: $("#foo")[0]
[19:50:25] <ajpiano> ^^
[19:50:33] <sammmy> Eviltwin: Yes, that's what I'm trying to do. How?
[19:50:52] <Eviltwin> sammmy: Why not just use .text()?
[19:51:08] <anphonic> whats a good php channel?
[19:51:12] <sammmy> Eviltwin: Why do you think?
[19:51:16] <Eviltwin> anphonic: ##php
[19:51:27] <Eviltwin> sammmy: 'Cause you're crazy
[19:51:58] <anphonic> Eviltwin: ty
[19:51:59] <Amnesi4c> coldhead, doesn't help:  http://jsfiddle.net/Amnesiac/wMvCQ/1/
[19:53:28] <sammmy> Eviltwin: Not quite. It's because I'm actually _replacing \n and \s with their HTML equivalents_. Therefore, I want to user html, so that my <br> and &nbsp; that I replaced in `text` get inserted into $elem.
[19:54:29] <sammmy> Eviltwin: If I use text, my <br> and &nbsp; would not be recognized.
[19:55:19] <Eviltwin> So you're trying to escape only HTML entities or something?
[19:55:30] <Amnesi4c> coldhead: got it! Thanks
[19:57:40] <polardude> I'm using the jquery countdown plugin from keith wood and I'm trying to pass the correctly formatted string to the countdown method
[19:58:30] <sammmy> Eviltwin: yeah.
[19:58:43] <polardude> I simply used a Date() object which has been manipulated by getTime and added 30 minutes
[19:59:04] <polardude> but I can't seem to find the correct format to count down to
[19:59:46] <sammmy> Eviltwin: I figured out this so far:  $elem.text(text); $elem.html($gauge.html().replace(...).replace(...));  This works fine, although doesn't seem like the best option.
[20:00:04] <sammmy> maybe it is, idk
[20:01:28] <polardude> http://pastebin.com/hE6XUBH7
[20:01:44] <polardude> Any ideas?
[20:14:20] <erebel55> has anyone ever written any code to zoom right up onto a selected component?
[20:14:21] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/43/
[20:14:37] <erebel55> i'm reading a keypress and when a component is selected, i want to zoom right up onto it
[20:14:47] <oojacoboo> what would cause a delegated event to not work?
[20:15:03] <ajpiano> a lot of things
[20:15:04] <oojacoboo> assuming that the DOM element is avail
[20:15:15] <ajpiano> that's like asking "What would cause a car to crash?"
[20:15:30] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: could you offer me a couple ideas on things to find
[20:15:44] <ajpiano> uhm
[20:15:46] <ajpiano> debug?
[20:15:54] <oojacoboo> :/
[20:16:20] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: I'm not really sure what to make of that
[20:16:43] <ajpiano> does the code that supposedly execute the binding actually execute?
[20:16:48] <ajpiano> set a breakpoint
[20:16:52] <ajpiano> at that point, are there elements
[20:17:09] <oojacoboo> the issue was the element being delegated to, I set it up the DOM and it works
[20:17:10] <ajpiano> sorry i just a bit busy atm
[20:17:16] <oojacoboo> but I haven't the slightest why that would be the case
[20:17:26] <ajpiano> conjecture is a waste of time for everyone
[20:17:29] <ajpiano> :|
[20:17:58] <oojacoboo> I guess I should have instead asked if there are common reasons for such an issue
[20:17:58] <ajpiano> so code would help, obviously
[20:18:14] <anphonic> join #nodejs
[20:18:17] <anphonic> oops
[20:18:17] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: it's the most simple example you could imagine, it's not a code issue
[20:18:26] <erebel55> or does anyone have an idea of how to get started?
[20:18:29] <ajpiano> the element you're delegating to not being there
[20:18:36] <oojacoboo> has to be the case, yes
[20:18:41] <oojacoboo> or something else conflicting it
[20:21:49] <infid> how come I can tap on a text input box on my ipad and safari will launch the virtual keyboard, but if i try to trigger a click event on an input box it doesn't bring up the keyboard?
[20:21:50] <oojacoboo> ajpiano: >< class not ID, fml, working on 3 apps with similar UIs sucks
[20:21:55] <ajpiano> :|
[20:22:01] <ajpiano> that's what i meant by debug :)
[20:22:01] <infid> in other words, how come: $("#inputName").focus().click(); doesn't bring up the virtual keyboard on the ipad
[20:23:02] <ajpiano> triggered events just aren't the same as native events :|
[20:24:15] <oojacoboo> I've never used trigger
[20:24:29] <infid> ajpiano: is that for me?
[20:24:30] <oojacoboo> I usually make a function and call that on the event
[20:24:40] <ajpiano> infid: you can try the native browser createEvent cycle
[20:24:51] <ajpiano> but i don't know
[20:24:56] <ajpiano> if that will work
[20:24:58] <ajpiano> infid yes
[20:26:04] <infid> ok thanks i'll try
[20:26:08] <ajpiano> infid: http://typeof.it/30/how-to-show-the-virtual-keyboard-using-javascript-in-ios/
[20:26:11] <ajpiano> i just googled that
[20:27:36] <tw2113> *bows*
[20:28:23] <infid> your google skills are better than mine, mine only turned up incorrect answers on stackoverdontknow
[20:28:27] <Eviltwin> That ajpiano sure can Google
[20:28:49] <infid> i hate when people accept and upvote incorrect answers
[20:29:02] <ajpiano> lol
[20:29:05] <ajpiano> "trigger ipad virtual keyboard javascript"
[20:30:12] <tw2113> well google caters your results anyway
[20:31:49] <infid> after they're done invading your privacy
[20:31:53] <infid> well they're never done with that
[20:43:10] <erebel55> is there some way i could have my transform autocenter the <g> on screen? http://jsfiddle.net/r9fRx/44/
[20:43:43] <erebel55> i'm trying to make it so i can click on <g> press e and it zooms to the component i'm selected on
[20:44:33] <erebel55> so i'll need to be playing around with this line
[20:44:39] <erebel55> $("#g0").attr('transform', 'translate(0, 0) scale(' + 2 + ',' + 2 + ')');
[20:46:55] <jahrichie> hey y'all, looking and thus far failing at manipulating  a class  on an image nav for a carousel.  It's the COMPANY DIRECTORS carousel near the bottom  http://chyeaa.com/charlie-bravo/mgmt/ I need the images that control that to use a class when that div is present. Thanks in advance for any suggestions
[20:48:36] <infid> erebel55: you might wanna try an svg handling library like Raphael.js
[20:49:26] <Lonestar99> good evening folks i know this is not jquery, but using both jquery and regular js in project --> var huePositionImg = document.createElement('div'); huePositionImg.setAttribute("id", "arr");
[20:49:55] <Lonestar99> does huePositionImg.setAttribute("id", "arr");  give the above div the id=a"arr" ??
[20:50:35] <Lonestar99> sorry  --> <div  id="arr"></div> ??
[20:51:12] <Lonestar99> for some reason the div id is empty on click
[20:52:34] <erebel55> infid: thank you
[20:53:43] <jahrichie> erebel55: infid is the man, indeed.
[20:56:32] <lopret> hey how can i get flexigrid all rows
[20:56:53] <lopret> not selected rows all row
[20:57:16] <infid> i think you have me confused with someone else
[21:31:05] <TheyCallMeBruce> how can i wait until a variable has a value or is not undefined?
[21:31:41] <Eviltwin> TheyCallMeBruce: You can't really
[21:35:47] <klocatelli> you could do something like (function check_undef(v, callback) { if (v !== undefined) { callback();} else { setTimeout(functon() { check_undef(v, callback);}, 100) }})(variable); maybe?
[21:36:10] <Eviltwin> That's bad
[21:36:14] <Eviltwin> Don't do that
[21:36:26] <klocatelli> how would you do it then?
[21:36:49] <Eviltwin> When you change the variable, you trigger an event
[21:36:52] <TheyCallMeBruce> :-|
[21:37:37] <klocatelli> yeah actually mine is terribly broken anyway :/
[21:45:01] <shadykhan> anyone around to help me with an ajax/lightbox issue?
[21:45:10] <Cork> ?ask
[21:45:11] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:46:05] <shadykhan> im ajaxing a page into my site and im using shadowbox as a lightbox plugin for the image
[21:46:14] <shadykhan> but when i click on the ajaxed image it doesnt work
[21:46:15] <shadykhan> http://www.imadkhan.me/new/#portfolio/alvi
[21:46:20] <shadykhan> but if i go directly to the page it will work
[21:46:43] <Cork> shadykhan: you can't ajax a different domain
[21:46:56] <shadykhan> im ajaxing the same domain...
[21:47:05] <shadykhan> im ajaxing a page in a differnt folder
[21:47:40] <Cork> shadykhan: what on that link doens't work?
[21:47:51] <optraz> $("#id select, :text").blah({}); i want to apply the function blah to only id="id" and html select and input type text. apparently, it apply to other input as well, is that syntax correct?
[21:48:36] <Cork> optraz: $('#id:text')
[21:48:42] <Cork> so no its not correct
[21:48:53] <Cork> and it has uneeded parts too
[21:49:04] <optraz> cork, what about select? i want id select and id :text
[21:49:18] <Cork> optraz: it's has to be uniq on the page, so its not needed
[21:49:33] <Cork> #id's can only exist  exactly once on the page
[21:49:55] <optraz> Cork: eh? do you understand what I want?
[21:49:55] <shadykhan> cork when u click on the image
[21:50:01] <shadykhan> its supposed to lightbox
[21:50:53] <Cork> shadykhan: looking, while your at it you have html errors in your page
[21:51:19] <Cork> script tags after body and the textarea is missing space between attributes
[21:51:27] <Cork> (and a stray closing div)
[21:51:38] <Cork> and some more
[21:52:12] <shadykhan> yeah i messed up some of the code
[21:52:16] <shadykhan> while copying and pasting shit around
[21:52:37] <optraz> Cork: do you mean ? $('#id:text,#id select')
[21:52:47] <Cork> optraz: no
[21:53:13] <optraz> ok, can you tell what is the correct syntax please?
[21:53:16] <Cork> optraz: do you want to select all selectboxes inside an element of the id #id ?
[21:53:26] <Cork> optraz: i already gave it to you
[21:53:36] <optraz> Cork> optraz: $('#id:text') <== this?
[21:53:37] <Cork> from what you said you wanted
[21:53:41] <Cork> yes
[21:53:46] <optraz> but what about select?
[21:54:16] <Cork> optraz: you alredy have an uniq id for the select element
[21:54:21] <Cork> theres no need for select
[21:55:03] <optraz> Cork: sorry, i do not get you on that
[21:55:06] <optraz> can you explain?
[21:55:29] <Cork> optraz: uh... id="something" can only exist ONCE in the page
[21:55:38] <Cork> you can NEVER have two elements with the same id
[21:55:49] <Cork> ever
[21:56:03] <Cork> if you set it twice in the page the browser only indexes the first
[21:56:09] <beancurd> use class if you have multiple.
[21:56:13] <optraz> Cork: I know. but I have input type text and select in that form.. i only want these two html element to applied the blah function
[21:56:13] <Cork> and you can never select the second
[21:56:32] <vl1234> gud morning to evry1
[21:56:35] <Cork> optraz: #id was the id on the select element right?
[21:56:56] <optraz> Cork: no, id was with the html form
[21:57:06] <optraz> this html form consist of input type text and select
[21:57:06] <Cork> sigh
[21:57:07] <Cork> ok
[21:57:11] <beancurd> optraz: then do <input type = "text" id ="whatever" class="applyblahfunction">
[21:57:32] <Cork> optraz: ok, so what is it you want to select again?
[21:57:42] <Cork> what you said before doesn't match what you say now
[21:58:02] <optraz> Cork: i want the blah function applied to select and :text
[21:58:23] <Cork> inside the form with the id?
[21:58:53] <optraz> Cork: yes, correct
[21:58:58] <Cork> $('#id select, #id :text') or $('#id').find('select, :text')
[22:01:02] <optraz> eh.. thank you :-s
[22:01:05] <optraz> Cork: +1
[22:01:06] <Cork> shadykhan: i suspect that shadowbox binds on the elements in dom, and not a generic one
[22:01:35] <Cork> shadykhan: so you might need to rerun the the init after you update the page wih ajax
[22:01:55] <Cork> shadykhan: hard to tell as the shadowbox file is minimized
[22:01:58] <DEADB33F> Any ideas why two attributes which start off with the same initial value won't animate at the same rate?
[22:02:21] <Cork> DEADB33F: attributes or css values?
[22:02:31] <DEADB33F> CSS even.
[22:02:48] <DEADB33F> I'm setting both the 'top' and 'margin-bottom' attributes to '-1000px', then trying to ease them both to 0px in step with each other.
[22:03:11] <Cork> ?p @ DEADB33F
[22:03:11] <bot-t> DEADB33F, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:17:57] <coldhead> well well well, it's Zackington
[22:33:10] <coldhead> THE ROOTS AND THE RUINS ARE THE SAME SAME
[22:34:41] <runvnc> ah, what coldhead?
[22:35:09] <mindis|wurk> i love cocaine too
[22:35:13] <mindis|wurk> uh, wait what?
[22:35:35] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:36:58] <Terminus> newbie question. any jquery function will always return a jquery object which is always an array right? i'm trying to wrap my head around foo.first().bar vs foo[0].bar
[22:38:01] <runvnc> you only use it as an array if you need to get the dom element
[22:38:05] <runvnc> which you usually dont
[22:38:21] <runvnc> usually I actually am only manipulating one jquery object at a time also
[22:38:31] <runvnc> or well
[22:38:36] <runvnc> if it is a bunch that I select
[22:38:45] <runvnc> I treat it as a single group
[22:38:49] <runvnc> same as if it were just one
[22:39:08] <Terminus> runvnc: ah... thanks.
[22:39:38] <coldhead> the more accustomed you become to jQuery the less often you will need to use the [array_index] technique
[22:39:50] <Terminus> runvnc: so, is there a jquery friendly way of getting foo[0].tagName?
[22:39:59] <runvnc> why do you need the tagname
[22:40:08] <coldhead> good question
[22:40:50] <runvnc> .prop('tagName')
[22:41:10] <runvnc> this.tagName
[22:41:28] <runvnc> if ($(this).is('h1'))
[22:41:33] <runvnc> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532331/can-jquery-provide-the-tag-name
[22:41:37] <Terminus> given "<div><a><p><a>" i'm trying to get the div when i mouseover any of the <a>
[22:41:51] <Terminus> runvnc: ah... thanks.
[22:41:53] <runvnc> .parents('div')
[22:42:06] <runvnc> $(this).parents('div')
[22:42:44] <runvnc> yw
[22:49:52] <infid> they get a divorce?
[22:54:54] <coldhead> if only in pencil
[22:55:14] <coldhead> Committed revision 159400.
[22:56:29] <Eviltwin> What is that, SVN?
[22:56:31] <Eviltwin> Learn to Git
[22:57:29] <coldhead> mmm tell that to our legacy
[23:09:52] <Terminus> another question. if i do foo.children('a').mouseover(), will a:hover { ... } in css match?
[23:10:36] <coldhead> no, Terminus
[23:10:40] <coldhead> sorry :(
[23:10:43] <Terminus> well, it doesn't work here but i'm trying to find a way to get anchors to match a:hover { ... } via javascript.
[23:11:02] <coldhead> you'd have to add a new CSS class and add like a:hover, a.fakehover {...}
[23:11:02] <Terminus> coldhead: ok... guess we'll have to do this the old way and duplicate the css properties. =(
[23:11:18] <coldhead> and then toggleClass('fakehover') in the JS
[23:11:21] <Terminus> coldhead: yeah... and then use toggleClass right?
[23:11:26] <coldhead> bam!
[23:11:33] <coldhead> good work
[23:12:12] <Terminus> thanks. i new about toggleClass, was just looking for a way to match a:hover itself. could have been something i missed. =)
[23:12:32] <Cork> Terminus: the css rules can be parsed and applied through js, though that means the page will take a bit longer to load
[23:13:20] <Terminus> Cork: nah... i'll stick with toggleClass. seems to be the least messy. i'm trying to avoid applying the CSS properties themselves in JS if possible.
[23:14:04] <coldhead> parsing the CSS would give me cancer
[23:14:05] <Cork> Terminus: ya, i didn't mean it was a better way, just that its an option
[23:14:10] <coldhead> or make my existing cancer worse
[23:14:16] <coldhead> achey
[23:14:20] <Cork> heh
[23:14:39] <Cork> window.StyleSheet isn't that bad actually
[23:15:44] <Terminus> last time i heavily used javascript was around 5 years ago so i have to relearn JS and learn jquery. >_<
[23:18:01] <limpc> hi, having trouble with the fullcalendar plugin, when i do $('#calendar-container').fullCalendar() i get "TypeError: $('#container').fullCalendar is not a function" ??
[23:18:28] <limpc> i have jquery loaded, the selector is correct (command console returns the element object), and fullcalendar.js is being loaded in the browser
[23:18:32] <coldhead> limpc: sounds like you may not be including the plugin properly
[23:18:41] <coldhead> or it would be available
[23:19:03] <coldhead> console.log('does this show anything', $.fn.fullCalendar) ?
[23:20:47] <limpc> hmm undefined.
[23:20:57] <limpc> but i see it being loaded, its available in the js console list
[23:22:00] <limpc> hrm its being included before jquery (this is in wordpress)..
[23:22:58] <amit_usual> how do i use jquery ui timepicker over an overlay
[23:23:10] <limpc> ok that fixed it. thanks
[23:24:40] <dddbmt> If I do like this ___ $('.myclass').on('click', function () {  $('.myclas').hide(); }); ____ Is there a way to hide all $('.myclass') except the element that was clicked?
[23:25:15] <Cork> $('.myclas').not(this).hide();
[23:25:53] <dddbmt> Oh, that was neat. thanks Cork!
[23:27:35] <coldhead> great job everyone
[23:27:39] <coldhead> seriously
[23:27:45] <coldhead> this is london 2012 olympic shit
[23:30:10] <mindis|wurk> what's the best way to use data as a selector if [data-something="derp"] doesn't work on elements that have had their data attributes modified by data()?
[23:32:59] <coldhead> mindis|wurk: if you;re getting that deep into data() you should read http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[23:33:38] <coldhead> if you need to query via that data you probably shouldn't be using data
[23:36:21] <mindis|wurk> k, i'll just modify the data the dom way
[23:37:58] <coldhead> good luck mindis
[23:38:42] <dddbmt> I tried to insert dynamically Facebook social like button on my webpage where I'd set the data-href attribute with jQuery. But for some reason FB.XFBML.parse() wouldn't recognize the change if I set it with .data('href', 'foo') - but it worked correct if I did .attr('data-href', 'foo') instead.
[23:38:53] <dddbmt> what is the difference on how those two values are set?
[23:39:49] <mindis|wurk> heh, we were just discussing that. see the link above
[23:40:27] <Xotix> hi
[23:40:34] <dddbmt> oh, sorry - didn't read that... thanks mindis|wurk
[23:40:44] <hexacode> anyone know a regex function in jquery similar to php preg match?
[23:41:31] <dddbmt> hexacode, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match ?
[23:46:35] <Xotix> I'm having problems getting postMEssage to work in IE. Why does this stupid browser even exist -.-  so, on page sub1.xx.com i got an iframe with sub2.xx.com loaded. On sub1 i have $(window).bind("message", function() { bla } and on sub2 i got parent.window.postMessage("hello world", "*") now I'm getting "access/permission denied" for sub2's code. Why?
[23:49:03] <dddbmt> Xotix, if your pages should be able to communicate they need to be on same (sub)domain...
[23:50:13] <Xotix> dddbmt why are ppl saying that to me? This was developed for CROSS origin scripts. So this doesn't matter at all. Rather how i access the parent window. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage
[23:51:49] <dddbmt> Xotix, yeah..... I don't know why people keep saying that.
[23:53:41] <Xotix> dddbmt, read the first paragraph of the link. but thanks anyway
[23:55:44] <Cork> Xotix: cause thats an extrealy common limitation
[23:55:59] <Cork> Xotix: what version of ie do you have problem in?
[23:56:04] <Xotix> 8,9
[23:56:49] <Xotix> Which should support it. Even some plugins which do this are using postMessage for ie8+ so the problem doesn't lie in having several domains rather I'm doing it just wrong :)
[23:56:51] <Cork> is the sites in iframes or where do you show them?
[23:58:07] <Xotix> i have an iframe (fancybox) included in sub1.xx.com. The iframe contains sub2.xx.com. I can't set the domain to xx.com, this causes other problems. It's an old old tool and i don't want to touch anything which already exists...
[23:59:37] <Lonestar99> g.evening
[23:59:44] <Cork> Xotix: hmm iframes should work
[23:59:57] <Cork> Xotix: ie is known to not support it for tabs and windows
