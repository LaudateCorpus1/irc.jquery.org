[06:42:01] <asdfghjk> hello everybody
[06:42:16] <asdfghjk> i have a problem with $(window).on('popstate', function() {
[06:42:30] <asdfghjk> it seems that i cannot get that event if the previous page is a POST request
[06:42:31] <asdfghjk> why?
[06:45:37] <asdfghjk> it only works if the previous request was a GET request
[06:54:19] <Cork> popstate only works for generated events
[06:54:28] <Cork> so there is no get/post as it is fake entries
[06:55:30] <Cork> s/events/history entries/
[06:56:32] <asdfghjk> Cork, pardon i mean... i go to page /page with a POST request
[06:56:38] <asdfghjk> then from that page i click on a link
[06:56:51] <asdfghjk> in the /next-page then i try to go back
[06:56:59] <asdfghjk> if i go back the event is not triggered
[06:57:11] <asdfghjk> if i call the /page with a GET request and then click on a link
[06:57:21] <asdfghjk> i can go back
[06:57:30] <asdfghjk> the problem is the POST request...
[06:57:34] <Cork> asdfghjk: again, if next-page works with popstate it means next-state is aborted as a link click and is done ex. through ajax instead
[06:57:42] <Cork> and then the current url changed with pushState
[06:57:58] <Cork> entries not added with replaceState or pushState DOES NOT FILE popstate
[06:58:14] <Cork> FILE=FIRE
[06:58:50] <asdfghjk> Cork, no my problem is that the browser can go back using a post request...so bascially i do https://bpa.st/PHUA
[06:59:08] <asdfghjk> can = CANT
[06:59:16] <Cork> donno if you just don't want to listen to what i say or not...
[06:59:29] <asdfghjk> i did not understand it well
[06:59:33] <Cork> so read the responses again, it won't change from me repeating it
[07:00:25] <asdfghjk> Cork, so basically i have to change the history ?
[07:00:36] <asdfghjk> *replace the previous
[07:00:43] <Cork> asdfghjk: you already have if you get a popstate event
[07:00:54] <Cork> 1. loading first page
[07:01:10] <Cork> 2. change current url with window.pushState
[07:01:14] <Cork> 3. go back
[07:01:22] <Cork> 4. popstate is triggered for the pushState
[07:01:46] <Cork> 5. go back again fires nothing as it is past the initial js loading
[07:02:35] <asdfghjk> ok thanks
[07:03:07] <Cork> so you most likely have something like ruby rocket or similar doing $('a').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $.ajax(...); });
[07:03:33] <asdfghjk> ok ok got it
[07:03:35] <asdfghjk> thank you very much
[07:03:38] <Cork> np
[07:04:07] <Cork> asdfghjk: one more thing, a form post without js can't not unload the js, so that is prob why you get the discrepency
[07:04:55] <asdfghjk> i am try
[07:04:58] <asdfghjk> trying
[16:04:29] <funhouse> Hello, having an issue here with a sidebar issue, I am building a single page app, I need to sidebar to collapse when I click on a link
[16:04:31] <funhouse> https://adminlte.io/docs/3.0/javascript/push-menu.html
[16:05:14] <robertmaxrees> funhouse so how do you replicate the bug?
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> funhouse and show the related code so we know what you're looking at.
[16:11:54] <funhouse> Just needs to be a link with href="#"
[16:12:05] <robertmaxrees> cool.  glad you fixed :)
[16:12:09] <funhouse> No not fixed
[16:12:13] <funhouse> To replicate
[16:12:13] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> so which link?\  where's the related code?
[16:18:24] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[16:28:32] <funhouse> What a headache
[16:28:39] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:46:29] <funhouse> Does anyone know what this means ?  var overlay = $('<div />', { id: 'sidebar-overlay'});
[16:46:42] <funhouse> Is that any div but the one with the id sidebar-overlay?
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> it creates a div with the id "sidebar-overlay"
[16:47:05] <funhouse> robertmaxrees ah ok thank you
[16:47:32] <funhouse> Does it just append it automatically?
[16:47:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> it just creates it.  doesn't do anything else.
[16:48:05] <robertmaxrees> something may later be doing something with that overlay object though.
[16:48:10] <funhouse> Ok
[17:57:54] <funhouse> In case I get disconnected, thank you for your help robertmaxrees
[17:58:04] <robertmaxrees> sure
