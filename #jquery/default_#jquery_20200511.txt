[06:57:52] <errorous> Hello. Any jquery experts available for hire on a one off project? kind of urgent
[06:58:10] <errorous> some knowledge of datatables/selctize needed
[07:37:48] <Cork> errorous: => ##freelance
[11:16:47] <codecutter> $elem.toggleClass('hidden') and $elem.removeClass('hidden'), neither of them appear to be working
[11:17:25] <Uhkis> then you have some other problem somewhere else
[11:18:07] <codecutter> any debug suggestions?
[11:18:52] <Uhkis> with this amount of shown code, maybe your $elem isn't a jquery object
[11:23:28] <codecutter> const $elem = $posts[0].children[1].children[0].children[0].children[1].children[0].children[0].children[0];
[11:23:28] <codecutter> $($($elem).next().find('a.btn')[0]).removeClass('hidden');
[11:25:20] <Uhkis> are you trying to build a house of cards?
[11:26:02] <codecutter> don't ask
[11:26:07] <codecutter> :)
[11:26:33] <codecutter> sanitise it if you can
[11:28:16] <makr8100> what is $elem.length ??
[11:31:08] <Uhkis> codecutter: why are you prefixing non-jquery vars with $
[11:31:38] <codecutter> $elem.length (undefined)
[11:31:39] <Uhkis> codecutter: why are you using jquery to get the object, turn it into domelement and then back to jquery
[11:32:14] <makr8100> if $elem.length is undefined then you aren't finding the target
[11:32:37] <Uhkis> makr8100: isn't it pretty obvious it's undefined after seeing how it's set ;D
[11:32:45] <codecutter> Uhkis: its too deep, so i just used chrome's web dev tool to navigate to the element i need and then right click to copy path
[11:33:45] <makr8100> Uhkis: I haven't been accused of something like that since Friday when I was asking for help with this line:
[11:33:47] <makr8100> var state = vueobj[h.view][el.attr('data-id')][el.attr('data-set')][el.attr('data-idx')][el.attr('data-line')][el.attr('data-lidx')][el.attr('data-state')];
[11:34:36] <codecutter> this seems to print out the element i want: $($($elem).next().find('a.btn')[0])
[11:34:52] <codecutter> so not sure why length is undefined
[11:35:11] <Uhkis> how about: $($elem).next().find('a.btn')
[11:36:08] <makr8100> codecutter: because your const definition is different than that and somewhere the structure is screwed up
[11:36:41] <makr8100> .find() is far more forgiving than children[1].children[0]....
[11:36:44] <codecutter> i'm trying to access content that is inside tippyjs tooltip
[11:37:27] <Uhkis> so you probably have some api method to do it
[13:20:09] <Jaseinatl> is there any way to get the settings for a given class?
[13:21:30] <Jaseinatl> sorry, the attributes for a given class, or maybe properties of a given class. I'm looking to get an object with properties defined like they are in a given classname.
[13:22:25] <dw1> maybe read the .css('prop') or $(...)[0].style
[13:23:01] <dw1> could apply to a dummy element $('<i>').addClass('someclass')...
[13:23:18] <Jaseinatl> style won't give me just the class attributes, it will give me the resultant style I think
[13:23:54] <dw1> isnt that what you want, the resulting style of the class
[13:24:09] <Jaseinatl> No. I want just the parameters defined by the class
[13:24:14] <dw1> ðŸ¤”
[13:24:45] <dw1> like what
[13:25:09] <dw1> classes are for applying styles
[13:25:20] <Jaseinatl> so if I have a css class defined  .foo{ opaicty:1, width:50px}   i would get an object {opacity:1, width:50})
[13:25:41] <bane500> Hey guys... attempting to do a simple hide function on a div with this 5 liner here: https://pastebin.com/hJWLh4Un - if i issue the $("#div-id").hide(); it works fine, but as soon as i try hide the div when i select a button it doesn't work. here is the html of the buttons i'm trying to use: https://pastebin.com/
[13:25:49] <Jaseinatl> applied to an element, reading the sytle would give me  height and about a billion other inherited properties
[13:25:59] <bane500> i'm new very new to jquery and not too well versed in html, excuse my ignorance lol
[13:26:05] <dw1> prob true
[13:26:36] <Jaseinatl> bane500, use codepen or jsfiddle to make a working example.
[13:26:54] <bane500> ok
[13:30:27] <dw1> you could grab the style object before applying the class then manually filter things that didnt change Jaseinatl
[13:30:33] <dw1> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[13:31:07] <bane500> hmm i think i got it working lol
[13:31:12] <bane500> 1 moment
[13:37:51] <bane500> works fine on jsfiddle
[13:37:54] <bane500> just not on my server :(
[13:40:43] <bane500> Maybe it's because on the actual website the form is nested a few more divs down then it was on the jsfiddle?
[13:43:09] <dw1> generally you will know the properties of a class before the script runs Jaseinatl :p
[13:43:42] <dw1> at least the key names
[13:44:39] <dw1> i guess js doesnt have that feature, to read only key names a class implements
[14:04:38] <Jaseinatl> dw1,  I have a section element that exists in one of two states (plus a possible transition). The Active State is bisible and at the top of it's containter. The inactive state (default) has margin-top:100% and opacity:0, some times I want to slide the section up and down (if it's parent container is visible). other times, I just want tit to be in the state (no animation).
[14:05:18] <Jaseinatl> If I could read the attributes of the "active" state I could use .animate() to handle the animations instead of css transitions
[14:06:09] <Jaseinatl> ideallly, I could do $("element").animate(".someClass", 3000, cb)
[14:07:07] <dw1> cant you just read select properties with .css('prop')
[14:07:10] <dw1> and use that for logic
[14:07:17] <dw1> or hasClass
[14:07:37] <Jaseinatl> hasClass just lets you know if it has the class, not how the class is defined
[14:07:40] <dw1> using classes for your current states
[14:07:54] <Jaseinatl> .css again would give you all the properites
[14:08:04] <dw1> .css returns only single properties
[14:08:08] <dw1> as named
[14:08:28] <Jaseinatl> which isn't going to help if this tool were used to slide left or right, for example
[14:08:46] <dw1> just add a class... "isleft"
[14:09:07] <dw1> when you slide left
[14:10:06] <Jaseinatl> what if the person wants opacity? Rotation? Etc. These are all different transition methods that would be nice to be able to read from the class rather than having to maintain a list of options and possibilities
[14:10:57] <dw1> make an array of relevant properties
[14:11:01] <dw1> and loop it to read them
[14:11:24] <Jaseinatl> when you start using css transforms, it will get really ugly to remember all of the possible transform options.
[15:31:12] <jKuro> Hello I'm trying to intercept this event to change the form submit action I tried a few things but I did not succeed any clues would be appreciated https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/31b648d4797c3e57e11c5bccd80bc60bc1873af4/assets/js/frontend/checkout.js#L35
[15:50:50] <Jaseinatl> IWhy is the click event happening on the body element in this pen? https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/PoPeVPw?editors=1111
[15:52:00] <dw1> jKuro: that looks like it would create an endless loop
[15:52:50] <dw1> on.('submit',function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }
[15:53:08] <dw1> er on(
[15:53:33] <dw1> or .submit(function... works too
[15:55:33] <dw1> Jaseinatl: maybe do let footer = $("#site-footer a"); footer.on("click", function (e) {
[15:56:32] <dw1> i dont see multiple arguments like you have in the docs https://api.jquery.com/click/
[15:56:45] <Jaseinatl> it's the on handler
[15:56:49] <dw1> oh yeah
[15:57:12] <dw1> hmm
[15:57:43] <Jaseinatl> it's the body.on ("click"...function that's messing up
[15:59:05] <dw1> everything is in the body
[15:59:08] <dw1> even the footer
[15:59:19] <dw1> if its body tag
[15:59:26] <Jaseinatl> The point is that if you click anywhere, it will hide the popup panel
[16:00:09] <Jaseinatl> by preventing default on the footer elements, it prevents body from receiving the event
[16:00:20] <dw1> k yeah im confused
[16:01:02] <dw1> so you dont want that or what
[16:01:27] <dw1> you lawyas wnat body click
[16:01:27] <Jaseinatl> By handling the click event on the body element, it allows you to click "off" the panel and hide it
[16:01:32] <dw1> always want body click
[16:01:34] <dw1> right
[16:01:43] <Jaseinatl> But it's firing automatically
[16:01:47] <Jaseinatl> without clicking
[16:02:05] <Jaseinatl> when I define the handler, it fires immediately
[16:02:34] <dw1> when the pen is loaded, there is no 'body clicked' in the console
[16:02:45] <Jaseinatl> That's why you see the panel
[16:02:55] <Jaseinatl> if you remove the body.on line, you will see the panel
[16:03:42] <Jaseinatl> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/PoPeVPw?editors=1111
[16:03:52] <Jaseinatl> like this. The panel pops up just fine when you click a footer item
[16:04:25] <Jaseinatl> but as soon as I define the body click handler, it thinks the someone clicked and it hides the content I just showed--so you don't see it.
[16:05:20] <dw1> idk i see two legal terms and conditions popups on load
[16:05:23] <dw1> only one can be closed
[16:05:27] <dw1> i cant trigger any panel
[16:05:30] <dw1> very confusing
[16:05:59] <Jaseinatl> It triggers the panel, then listend for the click event on the body then hides the panel. But you don't see it happening because the click event happens immediatley
[16:06:26] <Jaseinatl> so it looks like you can't get a panel to show up. Removing the click handler on the body and it works fine, expect when you click off the panel.
[16:10:57] <teut> how to load jquery in html?
[16:11:31] <teut> I used jquery a couple of years back and I remember that I used to link three script tags from the docs
[16:11:38] <teut> but now I cant find them
[16:11:41] <teut> plz help
[16:11:49] <dw1> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
[16:11:53] <Jaseinatl> did you google it?
[16:11:58] <dw1> just before </body>
[16:11:59] <teut> yes
[16:12:01] <dw1> and your script
[16:12:27] <teut> I am bad at css and thus using some code from code pen
[16:12:32] <teut> is it legal?
[16:12:44] <teut> I m making a django project
[16:12:57] <dw1> noone will sue you for that :p
[16:13:25] <teut> ok thanks for the info
[16:13:28] <dw1> technically the author has copyright but a lot is shared freely
[16:13:38] <dw1> and most people dont care about stuff like that
[16:14:03] <teut> then its fine
[16:14:15] <dw1> never heard of anyone enforcing copyright on css styles :D
[16:14:21] <dw1> maybe large scripts
[16:14:25] <dw1> that they work hard on
[16:14:35] <dw1> that'd be more likely
[16:14:39] <teut> css is tough
[16:14:42] <dw1> hehe
[16:14:47] <teut> takes too much time
[16:15:10] <teut> why is tag  included in the head?
[16:15:20] <dw1> what tag
[16:15:30] <teut> shouldnt it be in the bottom ?<script src="jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
[16:15:43] <dw1> yes before </body>
[16:15:48] <dw1> and your script
[16:16:06] <teut> script tags go at the end thats y I followed till now
[16:16:28] <dw1> some people put in head
[16:16:35] <dw1> so they can do inline script and stuff
[16:16:39] <dw1> in the body
[16:16:47] <dw1> but it increases first page load time
[16:17:37] <teut> I read that putting it at top causes js to run before loading of the html and eventlisteners dont work then
[16:18:05] <dw1> yes and no
[16:18:15] <dw1> if you put your script in https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[16:18:19] <dw1> it will run when the page is fully loaded
[16:18:23] <dw1> even if you put it in the head
[16:19:12] <dw1> short version $(()=>{ /*code*/ }
[16:19:17] <dw1> $(()=>{ /*code*/ });
[16:19:21] <dw1> :}
[16:19:32] <teut> yes I understood that stuff
[16:19:38] <teut> thanks again
[19:54:32] <Jaseinatl> can someone explain why the click event is firing on the body in this codepen? https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/PoPeVPw?editors=1111
[20:03:59] <Jaseinatl> I solved the problem by wrapping the click handler in another handler. Totally strange. Would love it if someone could explain why. Thanks.
[21:36:12] <dw1> it always opens properly for me in the fiddle
[21:36:45] <dw1> chrome dev channel
[21:37:11] <Jaseinatl> I just fixed it by capturing the click event twice.
[21:37:24] <dw1> sounds wrong
[21:38:04] <Jaseinatl> You'll notice in the code it says $()"body").one(function () { $("body").one(function (e) {hide panel...
[21:38:22] <dw1> oh, yeah.
[21:38:26] <Jaseinatl> it's does sound wrong, but I don't know how else to get the click event from firing.
[21:38:41] <dw1> you know what you need
[21:38:43] <dw1> it's not preventDefault
[21:39:02] <dw1> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation
[21:39:13] <dw1> or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopImmediatePropagation
[21:39:27] <dw1> ;)
[21:40:39] <dw1> then click wont bubble up to body event
[21:40:42] <dw1> â”—(-_-)â”›
[21:42:43] <dw1> preventDefault is for like form submissions, link hrefs
[21:43:38] <dw1> not lcick events
[21:43:39] <Jaseinatl> IBut here's what I don't get. But the time I establish the listener, the event is over
[21:43:47] <Jaseinatl> no new even is fired
[21:44:06] <Jaseinatl> whether I stopPropagation or not
[21:44:50] <dw1> huh
[21:44:54] <dw1> you bind the events on page load
[21:45:19] <Jaseinatl> but I don't bind the document click event until after the footer link is clicked
[21:45:33] <Jaseinatl> if you click on the body before a footer link, nothing happens.
[21:46:10] <Jaseinatl> It's only after the click event happens on a footer link that I setup the event handler. At that point, the next lcick even should be handled by the handler I just defined.
[21:46:11] <dw1> well maybe it considers you having the mouse down as a click
[21:46:15] <dw1> and it binds before you lift the button
[21:46:21] <dw1> kinda thing
[21:46:47] <dw1> and registers a click
[21:46:59] <dw1> cant you just bind it on page load and hide it
[21:47:09] <dw1> oh nm
[21:47:15] <dw1> well you could bind it on page load
[21:47:21] <dw1> but return false if the panel isnt open
[21:47:24] <dw1> or somethin
[21:47:46] <dw1> or just return, so close action doesnt run
[21:47:56] <dw1> doesnt matter what you return
[21:51:39] <dw1> also if you bind on the fly consider you need to remove the event
[21:52:01] <dw1> on('click.a'...
[21:52:05] <dw1> off('click.a'
[21:52:32] <Jaseinatl> .one does that for you
[21:52:33] <dw1> or it might bind twice
[21:54:32] <Jaseinatl> https://api.jquery.com/one/
[21:54:39] <dw1> cool
[21:54:45] <dw1> but yeah https://codepen.io/dw1/pen/dyYKdyg
[21:54:57] <dw1> binding a parent click on click seems to fire the click, yes
[21:55:04] <dw1> probably because the mouse is down when its bound
[21:56:35] <dw1> and/or mouseup triggers the click
[21:56:45] <Jaseinatl> The click event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is pressed and released.
[21:56:52] <Jaseinatl> https://api.jquery.com/click/
[21:57:38] <dw1> so probably conisders the mouse down and up yeah
[21:58:30] <dw1> hmm
[21:58:54] <dw1> but shoudl theoretically bind after the up
[21:58:59] <dw1> but doesnt seem to
[21:59:40] <Jaseinatl> stopPropagation doesn't work either. Thought that was a great idea. I do appreciate the help. It's a weird thing.
[22:00:10] <dw1> better just bind body click on load
[22:00:31] <dw1> seems to be the only way
[22:00:40] <dw1> then stopPropagation
[22:00:42] <dw1> on footer
[22:03:27] <dw1> or maybe wait until panel animation is done then load
[22:03:31] <dw1> if can guarantee mouse click is finished
[22:05:05] <Jaseinatl> lol. I just made a new jquery extension called $.fn.two() which fires a .one inside of a .one. LOL
[22:05:12] <dw1> ðŸ˜‘
[22:07:50] <Jaseinatl> I'm gonna risk it and ask in JS. They will likely yell at me that it's not #jquery, but maybe someone knows more about the click event there.
[22:09:31] <dw1> really youre fighting to save 0.00000001 ms of processor time
[22:09:57] <dw1> which it would take to have the event always bound and return if a class isnt on the body or whatever
[22:10:19] <dw1> like bootstrap puts 'modal' on the body when a modal is open
[22:10:46] <dw1> if(!$('body').hasClass('panelopen')) return;
[22:12:30] <Jaseinatl> I'm gonna write the event in plain javascript and see if it happens still.
[22:12:39] <dw1> :D
[22:16:07] <dw1> it does
[22:16:08] <dw1> ( à²  ÍœÊ– à² )
[23:22:38] <Jaseinatl> Figured out a better way to handle it. Handle the event on the window and remove it on mousedown
