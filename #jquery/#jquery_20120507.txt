[00:00:16] <coldhead> and then if ($(e.target).is('some selector that matches the children')) return;
[00:01:04] <coldhead> alternatively if (! $(e.target).is('selector that matches the parent')) return;
[00:01:16] <joyz> cheers

[00:05:08] <Whirl3d> mbrevda, that shows that a row is being cloned (to a new table) multiple times with it's formatting and all
[00:05:20] <zykes-> e/win 20
[00:05:34] <martisj> how can i animate the left attribute of an element using predefined styles?
[00:05:38] <martisj> Is it at all possible?
[00:07:06] <mbrevda> Whirl3d: thats regulat css, not actualy html manipulation. I think my issue is that im cloning the el before the other jquery code mutilates it. I moved the clone in to the function, cloning only of the var == undefined. This deferes the clone until the user clicks the first time, ensuring that the manipulations have already been aplied
[00:07:36] <mbrevda> http://pastebin.com/v1RsXfJA
[00:07:41] <coldhead> martisj: you need to use an animateClass plguin
[00:08:36] <coldhead> martisj: like http://jqueryui.com/demos/switchClass/
[00:10:48] <martisj> coldhead: thanks, i guess it's just easier to stick the animation numbers in the scirpt
[00:10:51] <martisj> script
[00:11:13] <martisj> do i have to add 'px' to the end of a number when animating the left property?
[00:13:05] <coldhead> no, martisj
[00:13:20] <martisj> okay thanks.
[00:13:23] <martisj> pointer.animate({'left': ani_left + 'px'}, 'slow');
[00:13:28] <martisj> so that would be overkill?
[00:13:37] <martisj> wouldn't need ani_left + 'px' ?
[00:13:42] <martisj> 'px'?
[00:13:46] <coldhead> wouldn't need em
[00:13:49] <coldhead> but feel free
[00:13:56] <coldhead> no harm
[00:14:01] <coldhead> its a bit slower
[00:14:08] <coldhead> because jQuery has to parse your string
[00:14:15] <coldhead> to find the number and the units
[00:14:19] <coldhead> so keep it simple, i say
[00:14:26] <coldhead> if it's just a digit it will assume pixels
[00:14:36] <coldhead> s/digit/numeric type/
[00:14:58] <martisj> okay sweet
[00:15:01] <martisj> thanks coldhead :D
[00:15:14] <coldhead> sure thing
[00:19:19] <Lyfesaver> i created a button for my UI dialog box and I want it to send the viewer to a link
[00:19:36] <Lyfesaver> i am guessing i need to change the part where my Cancle button says "close"
[00:19:41] <Lyfesaver> but i dont know what to put there
[00:19:47] <Lyfesaver> anyone know?
[00:23:01] <clb_> I am trying to duplicate a column of a table using jquery, but I'm not quite able to get this working: http://pastebin.com/nUbMEiDK
[00:23:36] <clb_> I'm trying to have one column with <td class="copy"> elements, which I'd duplicate in that manner
[00:23:38] <coldhead> clb_: use ?each // instead of for in
[00:23:38] <bot-t> clb_, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[00:23:52] <clb_> oh, awesome, thanks!
[00:24:21] <thenickb> hi all, trying to get lazy loading working with a carousel. currently working with the caroufredsel. Here's what I've got so far http://pastebin.com/57fvENRQ ... the lazy loading (which I grabbed from this example http://coolcarousels.frebsite.nl/c/14/) doesn't seem to be working, also i've tried to set only 1 item to scroll at a time, but 3 keep scrolling
[00:24:27] <thenickb> can anyone take a look?
[00:25:00] <thenickb> oddly the lazy loading seems to work locally for me
[00:26:38] <clb_> coldhead: yeah, that does the trick, thanks
[00:27:28] <coldhead> thenickb: i think we're going to need a live demo
[00:27:33] <coldhead> can you get it working on jsfiddle?
[00:27:38] <thenickb> kk, one sec
[00:33:33] <poppiez> I have a template that looks like <p class="test">{{{html}}}</p>. when I do Mustache.to_html(template, { html: '<div class="html">test</div>
[00:33:37] <toxz> if i refresh my page all running ajax requests end in the error callback... any ideas how i can prevent that?
[00:34:07] <poppiez> ' }); the resulting HTML is <p class="test"></p><div class="html">test</div><div></div> - why is that?
[00:34:44] <thenickb> coldhead: can i pm you the link?
[00:34:47] <coldhead> JUST PUT IT ALL DOWN AS "PROJET MANAGEMENT"
[00:34:56] <thenickb> we can discuss here of course
[00:35:02] <coldhead> here is better
[00:35:06] <thenickb> kk
[00:35:07] <coldhead> i'm sailing out shortly
[00:35:14] <thenickb> http://207.154.84.54/blueeyed/new-arrivals.html
[00:35:17] <coldhead> use bit.ly or something if you want to obscure the url
[00:35:23] <coldhead> or just paste away then :)
[00:35:24] <thenickb> its ok
[00:35:45] <topriddy> is there any concept of a placeholder for a drop down box?
[00:37:46] <coldhead> not that i know of, topriddy
[00:37:57] <coldhead> thenickb: i reckon this is your problem if ( $img.is( 'img' ) ) {
[00:38:04] <coldhead> i paused execution with my debugger
[00:38:13] <coldhead> and at that point $img is an <li>
[00:38:17] <coldhead> so it skips all that stuff
[00:38:22] <thenickb> hmm, okay
[00:38:33] <coldhead> suggest you do something like $img = $img.find('img');
[00:38:36] <coldhead> before that bit
[00:39:28] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/254wX4AE how can i make a callback function which works like this? like the one of $,post where you can create any parameter and it got the callback data. now, id need to use this within my callback function to get 'foo'
[00:39:38] <coldhead> thenickb: if you need to experiement more, just add debugger; within loadImg()
[00:39:38] <thenickb> you think if i got rid of the ul all together it would work?
[00:39:41] <coldhead> and you will pause there
[00:39:45] <coldhead> and you can see what's the dealio
[00:40:03] <thenickb> kk
[00:40:07] <coldhead> its probably easier to work with what you have
[00:40:14] <coldhead> but i have never heard of this carousel
[00:40:19] <coldhead> who knows what it wants
[00:40:30] <coldhead> WHAT DOES ANYONE WANT
[00:40:44] <thenickb> haha, yeah, i hadn't heard of it until tonight
[00:40:49] <Whirl3d> since it shows 3 images at a time, I think that next and prev automatically move 3 images
[00:41:00] <thenickb> been trying to get some carousel and some sort of lazy loading to work well together
[00:41:05] <thenickb> this is my best attempt yet
[00:41:47] <coldhead> i mostly write my own carousels these days, because it's easier to make every single stupid client change
[00:42:07] <coldhead> "i want it to scroll forward 6, then back 5, but not if the user is hovering or if the moon is full"
[00:42:51] <vpv4oo> does anyone have a link to get unique urls and states for a jQuery.load() application? for example: jquery.com/help loads the help page, clicking help on jquery.com/ will $('#content').load('help.php'); and change the adress bar to jquery.com/help (or similar)
[00:43:43] <thenickb> haha, i hear ya
[00:44:02] <vpv4oo> google somehow isnt really helpful at the moment
[00:44:38] <noaXess> hey all
[00:44:47] <coldhead> vpv4oo: the magic words to google for seem to be jquery ajax navigation
[00:45:02] <coldhead> which bringeth forth http://www.using-jquery.com/2011/01/ajax-navigation-window-location-hash/ &c.
[00:45:21] <vpv4oo> coldhead: thanks!
[00:45:25] <coldhead> that's ID based but the code is simple enough to rework how you want
[00:46:36] <coldhead> hello Trisox!
[00:47:28] <Xotix> callback.call(); if callback is specified as function() {}; how can i make that any parameter within function() is the returned data? e.g. callback('data').call(); and then function(x) {alert(x)} will alert 'data'; ?
[00:48:30] <coldhead> one doesn't really return from callbacks
[00:48:40] <coldhead> i think i misunderstand
[00:48:44] <Whirl3d> thenickb, can you pass scroll:1 to your carousel constructor?
[00:49:07] <Xotix> coldhead like the callback from $post()
[00:49:29] <Xotix> any parameter within your anonymouse functio nis the data returned by the request.
[00:49:57] <Whirl3d> thenickb, it defaults to 3
[00:50:10] <noaXess> i send data with $.ajax().. with this url: "script.php?name="+name+"&value="+value.. value is from a textarea with multi lines.. but the GET requests doesn't send a multiline vlaue... the return data of value is on a single line... how to force send multi lines?
[00:50:26] <coldhead> but returns to where? var x = $.post(...) does not give x the value returned from the callback
[00:50:51] <thenickb> whirl3d: i currently have scroll : { items: 1, duration: 500 }
[00:50:53] <coldhead> noaXess: use POST?
[00:51:01] <coldhead> GET suckkks for that much data
[00:51:14] <noaXess> coldhead: ok... try
[00:51:17] <Whirl3d> just try scroll:1
[00:51:19] <Xotix> coldhead like  http://pastebin.com/8xsBcbwz
[00:51:23] <thenickb> kk, doing now
[00:51:45] <thenickb> no go :(
[00:51:46] <noaXess> coldhead: so i need to change also script.php to work with POST data and not with GET data, right?
[00:52:09] <Whirl3d> if you look at the source, it has defaults.scroll=3;
[00:52:20] <coldhead> noaXess: that's what i'd do, you shouldn't have to change much
[00:52:22] <Whirl3d> but then it extends the options you provide when you initialize it.
[00:52:40] <Whirl3d> so $('sel').jcarousel({scroll:1}) will override it
[00:52:46] <noaXess> coldhead: just $_GET to $_POST ;)...
[00:52:55] <thenickb> sure, that's why i had the scroll items 1, ill edit the source
[00:53:07] <thenickb> kk, thanks
[00:53:37] <Whirl3d> line 25 of jcarousel.js
[00:54:09] <coldhead> Xotix: http://pastebin.com/3PYQ9g0w
[00:54:14] <coldhead> is that an option?
[00:54:21] <coldhead> i'm not sure that's even needed >: |
[00:54:41] <Trisox> hey coldhead
[00:54:59] <Trisox> hey Xotix
[00:55:03] <Xotix> coldhead, i think what i meant is sovled by call(this, myParams); so myParams are available within the first parameter in function();
[00:55:04] <thenickb> oh shit... whirl3d: im not actually using jcarousel right now
[00:55:06] <Xotix> Hi
[00:55:14] <Whirl3d> lol
[00:55:21] <thenickb> i've been trying multiple carousels
[00:55:23] <Guest3637> quit
[00:55:24] <Whirl3d> it's still loading for some reason.
[00:55:38] <thenickb> yeah, i can take it off for now
[00:55:54] <noaXess> coldhead: done ;) thanks.. also needed to split the querystring into data: "name="+name+"&value="+value
[00:56:08] <AFGreco> Does anyone knowo of a decent plugin like jqGrid but for gridview type items?  Basically to support easy paging, sorting... A custom coded one wouldn't be complicated but one that works hand in hand already with jqgrid (so i can switch between views like shopping sites do) would be awesome
[00:56:16] <thenickb> kk
[00:56:23] <coldhead> noaXess: way way way better to let jQuery build your query string for you
[00:56:24] <thenickb> im using caroufredsel
[00:56:41] <coldhead> data: {foo: 'bar', id: 'no_pants', aids: lol} etc
[00:56:47] <coldhead> it knows what to do
[00:57:12] <noaXess> coldhead: aha... ok.. but so json format..
[00:57:31] <coldhead> you say that like it's a bad thing
[00:57:41] <coldhead> it's a better thing that concatenating strings like a cave man
[00:57:55] <coldhead> "oh god do i need single or double quotes here"
[00:57:59] <Guest3637> is this chat site
[00:58:12] <coldhead> also jQuery detects where you already have a ? and so uses &s instead
[00:58:15] <noaXess> coldhead: i mean.. better to use json formating then directly use own querystring ;)
[00:58:20] <coldhead> oh good
[00:58:25] <coldhead> so we're in agreement
[00:58:30] <noaXess> hehe
[00:58:35] <coldhead> divine monarchy is the only valid system of social order
[00:58:36] <coldhead> ?cc
[00:58:37] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[00:59:08] <coldhead> bye tharkun, bye forever
[00:59:22] <Whirl3d> thenickb, do you have caroufredsel unpacked?
[00:59:27] <thenickb> whirl3d: the default in my current carousel for scroll items seems to be undefined
[00:59:30] <thenickb> yeah, i just loaded it up
[00:59:34] <thenickb> refresh and youll see it
[01:00:36] <thenickb> coldhead: do you think you could go a bit more into depth about what you were suggesting
[01:04:56] <thenickb> whirl3d: find anything?
[01:05:10] <cil> does anybody know what "ba is undefined" mean in the ui.datepicker ?
[01:05:11] <dawin> hi folks
[01:05:20] <Whirl3d> thenickb, still lookin
[01:05:26] <thenickb> kk
[01:05:28] <dawin> hi whirl :)
[01:06:54] <coldhead> thenickb: i'm not suggesting much, only that BECAUSE loadImage is looking for an image you should make sure it gets one, by finding the img within the li
[01:07:06] <coldhead> $img = $img.find('img')
[01:07:16] <coldhead> that's the short answer
[01:07:30] <coldhead> the long answer is you should rewrite loadImage to do what you need it to do
[01:08:37] <thenickb> i gotcha
[01:08:51] <Whirl3d> thenickb, it appears that it won't scroll by just one image. the functions where it gets //items next looks at the number visible elements and scrolls by that amount.
[01:09:38] <thenickb> well fun
[01:10:18] <Whirl3d> hi dawin, how's it goin?
[01:10:20] <thenickb> thanks for looking :)
[01:12:39] <dawin> Whirl3d: pretty good, still playing around with jq :D
[01:12:51] <dawin> Whirl3d: any you?
[01:13:35] <Whirl3d> yup. working on an animation engine.
[01:13:59] <dawin> nice
[01:14:15] <dawin> you going to make a game? :D
[01:15:20] <Whirl3d> naw. I just want an easier nomenclature for sequential animations  and reusable animations
[01:15:24] <coldhead> i am having such a nosebleed
[01:15:27] <coldhead> i'm going home
[01:15:37] <dawin> a.a
[01:15:38] <Whirl3d> gnight coldhead.
[01:16:03] <thenickb> thanks for all the help guys, im out too
[01:16:06] <thenickb> have a good one
[01:16:10] <dawin> gn
[01:16:15] <Whirl3d> gnight thenickb
[01:17:25] <dawin> is there a way to tell if the current object is within the window, this is for a tooltip, if the tooltips div is bigger then the current window it still shows up under the mouse, i wanna show it up over the mouse :S hope you understand? :D
[01:18:52] <dawin> i came up with if(($('#tooltip').position().top + $('#tooltip').height()) > $(window).height()) but this isnt workin :P
[01:18:54] <Whirl3d> so you want to ensure that the tooltip remains visible on the screen.
[01:19:13] <dawin> yes
[01:20:33] <Whirl3d> i usually write a quick function that returns the boundary positions of my element...like $(element).bounds()....so that it tells me the top, bottom, left, and right offset relative to the window (as well as a bunch of other crap).
[01:20:42] <dawin> maybe i should check for a tooltip plugin and see how they manage this
[01:21:36] <Whirl3d> then I just check if $(el).bounds["bottom"]>$(window).height()) {$(el).bounds("bottom",$(window).height())};
[01:21:52] <Whirl3d> They have some great tooltips that will handle all of that for you for sure
[01:21:56] <coppa> hop : automatic ajax refresh content and ajax navigation between pages (mobile friendly) https://github.com/binarymind/jquery-navigate
[01:22:08] <coppa> just have to include the file :)
[01:23:27] <dawin> well i dont like to use plugins tbh, cause i whant to learn jquery :D
[01:23:33] <dawin> want*
[01:24:16] <dawin> then i have 20 plugins in my site and i use out of the 100.000 functions they deliver only 10 :D
[01:26:46] <Whirl3d> trust me I only use a handful of plugins for the same reason.
[01:27:55] <coppa> dawin: agree, but I often inspire me of other work not to lose time
[01:30:31] <daniel> hi there. i have a question. on the header of this website http://detoxicolon.daciaplant.ro/ you will find some moving clouds. how can i do something similar using jquery? i have no idea
[01:31:05] <daniel> or whats the best way to do this
[01:31:15] <dawin> well iam into jq because jq mobile and there i like to stay as small as possible
[01:32:18] <dawin> its already early in the morning here, my english sucks :S but i hope you got what i wanted to say :D
[01:33:13] <jkarsrud> daniel: on that page there is a div with a background image, then that background is animated in an interval
[01:33:24] <Flo0815> i need to animate an element, fadeIn and moving to the Left (margin-right: 0px) SIMULTANEOUSLY. How can i do that?
[01:33:27] <jkarsrud> it's all in the moveImage function in functions.js :)
[01:34:14] <jkarsrud> daniel: http://detoxicolon.daciaplant.ro/scripts/functions.js
[01:34:18] <daniel> yes. i know this but how can i make the image to repeat?
[01:37:00] <daniel> thanks
[01:37:53] <Flo0815> i need to animate an element, fadeIn and moving to the Left (margin-right: 0px) SIMULTANEOUSLY. How can i do that?
[01:39:41] <Ricaz> Hey, anyone know of a simple plugin or just an easy way to slide objects horizontally? like slideUp() and slideDown()
[01:39:57] <gavin_huang> Flo0815, does this work? $(selector).animate({opacity: 'show', 'margin-right': 0})
[01:41:28] <Flo0815> gavin_huang: do i have to set the opacity to zero first? or display: none?
[01:42:08] <Flo0815> uh nice one, thanks gavin_huang! :)
[01:42:23] <gavin_huang> Flo0815, using 'show' automatically changes display
[01:43:15] <Flo0815> is there any chance to get an images width if it's set display: none?
[01:46:46] <gavin_huang> Flo0815, you can set visibility to hidden and show it temporarily to get its dimension if directly calling .width() doesn't work.
[01:47:43] <dawin> would be cool if jq had a editor wich would give out api information and information about functions, if a browser doesnt work with that function and stuff
[01:48:20] <Whirl3d> there aren't a lot of jquery methods that aren't cross-browser compatible.
[01:48:52] <Whirl3d> that's one of the big advantages to jquery
[01:49:06] <Taggnostr> how do I select all the elements in a page except the first one?  I have different sections that use an <h2>, and I want to do something with all the <h2> except the one in the first section
[01:49:13] <Whirl3d> I use Aptana 2.0 and it has syntax hinting
[01:49:21] <dawin> api information on the fly, maybe small function analyzer, auto complete, syntax highlighting, maybe in java or so eclipse so it would work on any os :D
[01:49:39] <Whirl3d> $("h2").not(":first");
[01:49:52] <Whirl3d> or $("h2").gt(0);
[01:50:07] <Taggnostr> thanks!
[01:50:13] <dawin> and irc chat included to chat with whirl xD
[01:50:53] <Whirl3d> I can't believe no one has bastardized IRC to make a really great IRC client
[01:52:08] <Whirl3d> I just wish that jsfiddle would marry piratePad and have really smart, sexy children.
[01:52:26] <dawin> i use gedit
[01:52:45] <dawin> and here and there for python aptana
[01:54:22] <Whirl3d> I love aptana, actually. It does lint checking inline and syntax highlighting and is really flexible/easy to configure.
[01:54:52] <dawin> and the good part it is in java :D
[01:55:20] <rgr> I have multiple $(document).ready instances on the same page and the documentation indicates this should be ok. But for some reason the addition of the second one has now stopped other jquery triggering on the page. What could cause this?
[01:55:33] <smurfke> most javas ide's feel quite sluggish
[01:55:46] <rgr> ? Eclipse certainly does.
[01:56:10] <Lyfesaver> I am using a slider to postion in video length and use it as a seek-slider... here is a snippit of the code http://jsfiddle.net/69mMt/1/ and everything is working well. I was just wondering if there was an easy way to only have it show on hover.
[01:56:11] <Whirl3d> true that. I tried eclipse a long while back and decided no way
[01:56:16] <Lyfesaver> any suggestions?
[01:56:31] <rgr> eclipse is a complete dog. Powerful yes, but typical "java" : slow, bloated and over enginerred.
[01:56:56] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, in CSS apply a :hover definition that shows the slider and hide it otherwise
[01:57:17] <Lyfesaver> kk i was going to use CSS, thot there might be a built in js way of doing it
[01:57:21] <Lyfesaver> thx Whirl3d =)
[01:57:43] <Whirl3d> in css3 you could even animate it
[01:57:44] <Lyfesaver> just trying to learn as I go along =)
[01:57:56] <Lyfesaver> very good point
[01:58:00] <dawin> well
[01:58:03] <Whirl3d> I think that css for your case will be the cleanest and easiest
[01:58:08] <rgr> so multiple $(document).ready shoudl be ok or not? Only my first one is triggering.
[01:58:11] <dawin> java is a powerfull lang, but you have to optimize the code to the max
[01:58:16] <Lyfesaver> right on =) thx
[01:58:25] <Whirl3d> yes
[01:58:32] <rgr> which defeats the point of java in many respects.
[01:58:35] <Whirl3d> multiple ready commands will all work
[01:58:52] <dawin> best java app is i guess virtualbox
[01:58:59] <rgr> well I have multiple and only the first is triggering. if i remove the first then the second triggers.
[01:59:18] <rgr> no special syntax for multiple instances?
[01:59:43] <Whirl3d> nope. But handlers fire in the order they were bound. So perhaps you need to make sure that your first one isn't hanging.
[01:59:53] <rgr> dawin: what? vbox?!?!
[02:00:05] <rgr> or you mean the ui to vbox for starting it?
[02:00:13] <rgr> Whirl3d: ah ok, thanks
[02:00:17] <dawin> isnt vbox in java, python and c
[02:00:27] <rgr> its not a "java app".
[02:00:41] <dawin> hmm
[02:00:53] <rgr> it has some bits done in java and its most certainly not "the best java app". That's ridiculous.
[02:01:08] <rgr> anywas thanks. I'll check completion.
[02:04:04] <dawin> humm i thought it would be in java too a.a checkd the source its c/c++ py
[02:04:37] <dawin> the only other example of a good app is then jdownloder xD
[02:04:54] <dawin> jdownloader*
[02:05:41] <beancurd> minecraft.
[02:05:53] <beancurd> android.
[02:07:55] <dawin> wich part of android is in java?
[02:08:39] <beancurd> the bits they're getting sued for.
[02:09:07] <dawin> android should be based on linux as far as i recall
[02:09:24] <beancurd> yeah, android applications are written in java
[02:10:32] <dawin> ah
[02:10:43] <dawin> its based on linux but the platform is in java your right
[02:13:59] <dawin> https://github.com/xamarin/XobotOS they ported android to c# :D
[02:14:23] <dawin> says its runs faster then the normal os, no wonder if its in java x.x
[02:14:24] <dawin> but well
[02:15:08] <Ricaz> Hey, anyone know of a simple plugin or just an easy way to slide objects horizontally? like slideUp() and slideDown()
[02:15:39] <Ricaz> I read that you can use hide() and show() with 'direction: "left"', but it doesn't seem to work
[02:19:57] <Danneh_> heya guys, I'm making a website which loads content from html pages in the same domain using jQuery+AJAX
[02:20:06] <Danneh_> the problem I'm having is that once any AJAX load returns an error, all further AJAX loads return errors as well (even after reloading the page)
[02:20:17] <Danneh_> if anyone could help, it'd be appreciated ( http://jsfiddle.net/63ELV/ )
[02:21:39] <Danneh_> the AJAX loads work just fine, I randomly jump around about 20 links or so before I encounter an error and it doesn't work anymore
[02:24:48] <Whirl3d> Danneh, look at the jsfiddle window to get a clue about what it is used for. It has a place for javascript, for html, for css and for output. What does yout HTML looklike
[02:25:08] <Whirl3d> and you are aware that you are using load and not .ajax, right?
[02:25:39] <Whirl3d> And you don't need all that header crap in your javascript window. The more you help us, the more we can help you.
[02:26:30] <Danneh_> Ah, alrighty
[02:26:52] <Whirl3d> and you will probably want to do something like: content.load(link, successhandler).error(errorHandler);
[02:26:53] <Danneh_> Sorry, new to the whole javascript game, I'll try fixing that
[02:27:11] <Whirl3d> no problem. I figured as much. Didn't mean to sound rude. Just being direct.
[02:28:33] <Whirl3d> now if you decide that you want to use .ajax to load your content, for whatever reason, you would use the syntax: $.ajax(url, {datatype:"html",success:successHandler, error:errorHandler});
[02:29:49] <Whirl3d> the advantage to using .load is that you can load "page fragments".  by specifying the content using a selector. If your loaded html file does not have content that matches your selector, it fails quietly, however.
[02:30:13] <Whirl3d> So you have to make sure that you have a div id='content' if you plan to use link+" #content"
[02:30:55] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, are you using jqueryUI? because I believe the hide and show modifiers are present on in jqueryUI
[02:33:42] <onats> hi guys, what do you guys use for image rotation?
[02:34:07] <Whirl3d> css3 image rotation transformations
[02:36:04] <varnie> Hello.
[02:36:12] <dawin> someone use firequery? is this addon usefull at all? just found it x.x
[02:36:51] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d, can u tell me what i am doing wrong here please.... i think i just doing it wrong http://jsfiddle.net/8nBLb/
[02:36:52] <Ricaz> Thank you Whirl3d, that's what I need :)
[02:36:54] <Taggnostr> $('h2').title = 'foo'; doesn't seem to work, should I use something like $('h2').each(function () { this.title = 'foo'; }) or is there a better way to do it?
[02:37:17] <varnie> I am trying to attach click event for some items, but the problem is that on the moment document gets loaded they're absent. they will appear after the user click "show" button activating popup. I don't get why on this moment that previously installed $(..).on doesn't work
[02:37:31] <Whirl3d> Taggnostr, .title is not a jquery method
[02:37:43] <dawin> $('h2').attr('title','') ?
[02:37:47] <varnie> how should I install click handler for future items?
[02:37:47] <Whirl3d> you probably want $("h2").text("something");
[02:38:05] <Whirl3d> varnie, loookup .on
[02:38:13] <varnie> I use it already.
[02:38:16] <Taggnostr> I want to change the title="" of all the h2, maybe what dawin said is what I'm looking for
[02:38:46] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d, i was just following this example http://jsfiddle.net/Vqmaw/
[02:39:03] <Taggnostr> yep, it seems to work, thanks!
[02:39:10] <dawin> np :D
[02:40:13] <Whirl3d> varnie, than it should work. You apply .on to the containerof the itesm you are adding in the future
[02:41:19] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, you trollin'? You give me 800 lines of code in your example, then say you are just following the code in a fiddle that has no javascript and two lines of CSS, really?
[02:41:31] <varnie> so it is wrong to apply .on directly to say, div with specific class?
[02:41:38] <Lyfesaver> no i am not trollin
[02:41:42] <DimmuR> Hello everyone. Does anyone know method to resize iframe that loads data from other domain without modyfying site that contains this iframe?
[02:41:45] <Lyfesaver> nvrmnd
[02:41:57] <Lyfesaver> i will just try to tackle it in the AM
[02:41:59] <Whirl3d> varnie, itf that class is holding the elements you are adding, than it is fine.
[02:42:01] <Lyfesaver> almost 5 here
[02:42:26] <Whirl3d> varnie, however, if you are adding those elements, they won't be bound at runtime because the script is passed.
[02:42:35] <Whirl3d> I'ts 5:40 here
[02:42:41] <varnie> yes it is what I do
[02:42:52] <Lyfesaver> Whirl3d, i was applying the same CSS trick t hover as in that example... just trying to show it on its most basic level.....
[02:42:56] <Lyfesaver> relax
[02:43:02] <Lyfesaver> its nothing to get upset over
[02:43:04] <Whirl3d> Than it should work. Can you setup a fiddle with your code and I'll look at it.
[02:43:04] <Lyfesaver> nite all
[02:43:08] <Whirl3d> Not upset
[02:43:11] <Lyfesaver> i did
[02:43:13] <Lyfesaver> sry
[02:43:14] <Lyfesaver> i am really
[02:43:16] <Lyfesaver> tired
[02:43:26] <Lyfesaver> the first fiddle is my code
[02:43:31] <Zhy> Hey everyonwe I saw this post about bigger jquery-ui icons http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/26308090/ThemeRoller-icon-set and I'M wondering whether they are already implemented or, if that's not the case, if there's an easy way to increase the size of the jquery-ui icons? I'd like to use them as their color is adjusted to the chosen ui-theme but they are too small for what I have in mind
[02:43:35] <Whirl3d> varnie, can you setup a fiddle with your code and I'll look at it
[02:43:38] <Lyfesaver> it is just dealdragger hidden by an H%
[02:43:44] <Lyfesaver> h5
[02:43:52] <Lyfesaver> and it is not working
[02:44:18] <Lyfesaver> when the div does not cantain dragdealer, then it works
[02:44:30] <Lyfesaver> so i guess the problem is either me or dragdealer
[02:44:36] <dawin> whats smarter, on each a.hover i get some informations for my tooltip from ajax, isnt it better the store the data into the dom instead to fetch the data each time from the server?
[02:44:51] <dawin> i mean store it and if i need this popup again just get the data out of the dom instead to call ajax again
[02:45:02] <Lyfesaver> nite all
[02:45:28] <Whirl3d> Lyfesaver, I realize you are tired, but wtf? I can't even figure out what you are trying to do. Wha tyou should do is find somewhere online where your dragdealer script is located. Then under the left l=panel where it says ADD RESOURCES...include the dragdealer.js script.
[02:45:34] <Whirl3d> THen all we see is your code.
[02:45:51] <Whirl3d> which is going to be a lot easier than trying to learn an entire new plugin
[02:46:11] <Whirl3d> and a lot less to ask fo someone who is generously offering help to folks for free.
[02:46:39] <varnie> I'll try to fix it firstly
[02:47:01] <dawin> whirl, store ajax (json array) or fetch it each time again? :D what do you say?? :P
[02:47:24] <Whirl3d> ZHY, because you are using jqueryUI, you can customize the source files and have them point their icon URLs to whatever source image you want.
[02:48:26] <Whirl3d> Zhy, so if you want larger icons, you'll just have to scan the source for UI and find wherever they refer to one of the UI.icon classes and make sure that it includes the new width/height of the new icons in your set
[02:49:10] <abhinav_singh>  In my app when issuing HTTP delete i am getting 405 method not allowed error some time   ..any idea why?
[02:49:17] <varnie> Whirl3d, I figured out that .live works, while .on does not
[02:49:20] <Whirl3d> varnie, where were we?
[02:49:32] <Whirl3d> .live does not work. It's deprecated and miserable.
[02:49:39] <Whirl3d> It is really just .on on the document body
[02:49:58] <shabble> if I have a broken jq plugin that's using $.browser (and doing dumb shit because of it), is ther any way I can wrap it to pass in fake $.browser data?
[02:49:59] <Whirl3d> You could accomplish the same with .on on the document body and save a lot of hasssle.
[02:50:07] <shabble> ideally without modifying the thing itself
[02:50:28] <Whirl3d> But it's better to restrict your .on handler to the parent most element of the elements you are adding. Then it will work regardless of how many things you add.
[02:51:03] <Whirl3d> shabbe, that all depends on the plugin's api.
[02:51:28] <Whirl3d> chances are it's an old plugin if its using brower id like that. So it might not have a very robust api
[02:51:46] <varnie> thanks you for the help. it works ;)
[02:52:07] <Whirl3d> right on.
[02:52:35] <Whirl3d> abhinav_singh, are you in the right channel?
[02:52:47] <shabble> Whirl3d: it's jqGrid, which I think is still quite widely used
[02:53:19] <Whirl3d> sure. I would look up the use cases for it. Chances are someone has fixed it or has links to how they wrapped it differently.
[02:53:32] <crashev_> hello, how to match elements that for example have $('.class1 .class2').html(label); but they do not have class .protected, tryed $('.class1 .class2 :not(.protected)').html(label) but it seem not to work ?
[02:53:57] <Whirl3d> And since jqgrid is as widely used as it is, there are tons of resources ou there to help you get exactly what you are looking for.
[02:53:58] <Zhy> thanks Whirl3d, but apparently there are no readymade icon packages of the jquery-ui icons in bigger sizes, right?
[02:54:12] <Whirl3d> I didn't say that, Zhy....
[02:54:18] <Whirl3d> but I don't know of any
[02:54:35] <Whirl3d> ajpiano would be the hero to ask. He knows everything UI or JQUERY related.
[02:54:44] <xec_> crashev_: is the protected class on the same element as class2?
[02:55:48] <crashev_> xec_: element is <span class='class1 class2'></span> and when I add protected to it, I don't it be matched
[02:55:52] <Whirl3d> cahev, try $(".case1, .case2").not(".protected").html(....
[02:56:02] <Zhy> Okay, sorry I didn't want to assume things you didn't say, I just figured if there were any popular icon packes they'd be widely known and someone here could tell me :)
[02:56:10] <Whirl3d> omit the comma then.
[02:56:10] <xec_> crashev_: lose the spaces in the selector
[02:56:14] <Zhy> *packages
[02:56:18] <Whirl3d> replace them with .
[02:56:28] <Whirl3d> lol.
[02:56:36] <xec_> crashev_: a space in css means you're looking for descendants
[02:57:04] <Whirl3d> try $("case1.case2").not(".protected").html(...
[02:57:05] <varnie> good bye
[02:57:12] <Whirl3d> varnie, goonight.
[02:57:17] <varnie> thank you again;)
[02:57:32] <Whirl3d> Im switching keyboards. my . key and shift key are messing up. BRB
[02:57:42] <crashev_> xec_: Ah right, I think I know where I lost myself :)
[02:57:56] <crashev_> Whirl3d: this seems to work as well
[02:59:05] <Flo0815> is it possible to use a function as a $.animate-parameter? i want to fadeIn and rotate an element simultaneously
[02:59:12] <Whirl3d> Zhy, I don't use jqueryUI that much, sorry I wish I knew more. But it seems like someone must have. Check gitHub and see if someone has made the UI Icons modular?
[02:59:42] <Whirl3d> Flo815, use CSS3
[02:59:54] <Flo0815> like?
[03:00:09] <Whirl3d> Lookup CSS3 transformation
[03:00:21] <crashev_> xec_, Whirl3d: thanks for help, I've got what I needed :)
[03:00:40] <Whirl3d> There are lots of css3 hardware accellerated transformations (including rotation) that would do what you want smoother and faster than jquery
[03:00:49] <Whirl3d> but not for older browsers.
[03:00:57] <Flo0815> i dont need old browsers
[03:01:08] <xec_> crashev_: if you're worried about performance, it seems :not() selector is quicker than .not() method http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not
[03:01:20] <Flo0815> i dont need, means, i dont have to care
[03:01:49] <Whirl3d> http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/
[03:02:35] <crashev_> xec_: did not know, so I will use :not() then, I'm always worried about performance :)
[03:03:46] <Whirl3d> xec_, good to know. I generally thought the :psuedo selectors were slower
[03:04:21] <xec_> often, yes - but when css3 is supported natively they are pretty much always quicker
[03:04:41] <xec_> i find the .not() method better for readability though
[03:05:05] <Flo0815> Whirl3d: so it is possible  to do animations in css? or do i have to do sth. like: loop, and set the css-rotate-value +1 in every step?
[03:05:20] <blackspotwiggins> Flo0815, you set the start and end state
[03:05:28] <blackspotwiggins> the animation is automagical
[03:05:33] <Whirl3d> on the page I linked above it's all about animation
[03:05:41] <Flo0815> kk
[03:05:41] <Flo0815> thx
[03:05:46] <blackspotwiggins> if you _really_ want to, you can set individual keyframes
[03:06:08] <blackspotwiggins> but it seems like you need transition instead of animation anyway..
[03:06:32] <Nece228> hello here is a code which is functioning
[03:06:33] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/30485459
[03:07:08] <Nece228> now after the $.post('delete.php', {value: $(this).attr('value')}, function(data) i need to refresh the page
[03:07:20] <blackspotwiggins> Nece228, dont use ajax?
[03:07:22] <Nece228> basically re execute the code from beginning
[03:07:36] <Nece228> blackspotwiggins: i do use
[03:07:55] <blackspotwiggins> if you want your ajax page to work as a regular one, its kinda stupid
[03:08:13] <Nece228> i dont want to
[03:08:26] <Nece228> the task is to do that dynamically with javascript
[03:08:39] <Nece228> without refreshing the page
[03:09:12] <dawin> can someobody help me to merge arrays into 1 multiple array ? http://jsbin.com/eqojuw/edit
[03:10:35] <Nece228> i basically want to recall $.getJSON function
[03:10:43] <Nece228> below the $.post line
[03:13:36] <dawin> got it
[03:16:12] <Nece228> is this correct syntax?
[03:16:13] <Nece228> $.getJSON('json.php',{check: true}, function retrieve(data) {
[03:16:26] <Nece228> i wanted to name the function
[03:17:54] <Whirl3d> no
[03:18:10] <Whirl3d> if you want it named, define it as a variable before your getJSON
[03:18:17] <Flo0815> blackspotwiggins, Whirl3d: if i want to start a animation/transform/... with css3, how can i start the animation after a function is finished? just assing the css-values?
[03:18:41] <Whirl3d> assign the animated class at the end of the funtion
[03:18:41] <blackspotwiggins> Flo0815, add a class to the element
[03:18:47] <blackspotwiggins> and define the class as the endpoint
[03:18:54] <Flo0815> hm k
[03:19:58] <Nece228> Whirl3d: for instance?
[03:20:36] <Whirl3d> var retrieve=function () {}    $.getJSON(url, {check:true}, retreive);
[03:21:26] <Nece228> ah thanks
[03:33:33] <Zhy> Whirl3d sorry for my delayed answer - thanks, I'll check github :)
[03:34:27] <Jaycob> hey! http://jsfiddle.net/7aBjv/ how can I do this?
[03:34:50] <Jaycob> do I need to use a for-loop or can it be done smartly using selectors?
[03:35:34] <xec_> ?each @ Jaycob
[03:35:35] <bot-t> Jaycob, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[03:35:40] <Whirl3d> is group an html5 attribute
[03:35:47] <Jaycob> no
[03:36:03] <Whirl3d> then you might want to use data-group=3
[03:36:43] <blackspotwiggins> you might want to just set the value in the first place..
[03:37:03] <Jaycob> oh ok! then I also need the selector changed to $("[data-group=3]")?
[03:37:20] <Whirl3d> and I think you will have problems with using the default keyword. Not sure, but I would use data-deflt
[03:37:27] <Hippie_> When I call $("#street").validationEngine('validate') the validation message doesn't show.. Ideas?
[03:37:37] <Jaycob> it's part of a bigger code where on the press of a button all fields should revert to the default
[03:37:42] <Jaycob> xec_: thanks!
[03:37:57] <xec_> Jaycob: you can use the defaultValue property for that
[03:38:11] <xec_> Jaycob: assuming you do as blackspotwiggins says
[03:38:30] <Jaycob> ok, cool
[03:39:38] <Jaycob> is there some kind of harm it can do if I use non-standard attributes btw?
[03:39:45] <Jaycob> or is it simply good practise
[03:39:46] <iamntz> Some kind of pet project that detects every keyframe on CSS animations. What do you think guys? https://github.com/iamntz/jQuery-keyframe
[03:40:06] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7aBjv/1/
[03:40:19] <Whirl3d> my understanding is that some browsers will break with non-standard html.
[03:40:36] <Jaycob> yeah
[03:40:41] <blackspotwiggins> Jaycob, it's more of a good practice. it can lead to unexpected bugs tho
[03:40:41] <Jaycob> hey thanks for the code :)
[03:40:52] <Whirl3d> and now with the data- prefix in html5, there's no need for custom attributes
[03:41:01] <Jaycob> but usind "data-x" is ok?
[03:41:03] <Jaycob> ok!
[03:41:07] <xec_> Whirl3d, Jaycob: http://jsfiddle.net/7aBjv/2/
[03:41:53] <Jaycob> thanks
[03:42:08] <Whirl3d> xec_ that is one thing I wish I would get better at: using the native element values/props There is no need to wrap it in jquery, but I do it by default.
[03:42:10] <Whirl3d> thanks
[03:42:58] <xec_> there is also no need for javascript at all if you want to reset a form
[03:43:47] <Jaycob> in HTML5 you mean?
[03:43:58] <xec_> http://jsfiddle.net/7aBjv/3/
[03:44:10] <Jaycob> oh right! haha
[03:44:17] <Jaycob> totally forgot it's that simple
[03:51:03] <dawin> what do i miss here :( http://jsfiddle.net/whWrR/
[03:51:26] <Jaycob> big thanks for the help guys, problem fixed in record time!
[03:52:27] <zulu-gula> when form loads input is empty. I filled form and before I submit I need to get value of input, but $(input).val() returns null. how to get new value?
[03:53:04] <dawin> $(input).attr('text');?
[03:53:18] <dawin> $(input).attr('value');
[03:53:19] <Whirl3d> what is $(input)?
[03:53:37] <Whirl3d> if you mean $("input").val()....which input?
[03:53:53] <xec_> dawin: are you nesting all these arrays and objects on purpose? what is this script supposed to do?
[03:53:59] <Whirl3d> if you mean $("input").first().val()   it will give you the first input fields' value
[03:54:14] <dawin> xec_ this will store ajax calls so i dont have to requery the server
[03:55:38] <Ricaz> Can anyone help me with a problem? http://jsfiddle.net/QHjjP/
[03:55:46] <Ricaz> I'm trying to create a smooth slide
[03:56:06] <zulu-gula> Whirl3d:  it does not matter what input, in my code it calls to one input by id: $('#input-name')
[03:56:11] <Ricaz> I want the elements to just follow eachother
[03:57:35] <Whirl3d> Ricaz, this is a css thing, I think. You need to set your pages to position:absolute
[03:58:30] <Ricaz> Well, there's a problem with that..
[03:58:41] <Whirl3d> you want them to scroll up and down?
[03:59:06] <Ricaz> No, not at all
[03:59:13] <Ricaz> but you can see it screws up
[03:59:21] <Ricaz> I just want them to stay at the same height
[04:00:08] <Whirl3d> I think you should wrap your (insert number of visible elements) in a div and animate that absolutely psoitinoed div
[04:02:21] <Whirl3d> I don't think its appropriate to have a number as the first character in an ID attribute either. fyi. I think it breaks IE
[04:02:29] <Ricaz> woops, disconnected
[04:04:19] <giorgian> Hi. can a Deferred object detect that a consumer is waiting for it to do its job?
[04:04:30] <dawin> xec_ i got i thx, iam to sleepy i guess :D
[04:04:38] <xec_> dawin: looks like a lot of work for little gain
[04:05:37] <dawin> i have like 2.7k links wich querys the server each time on mousehover, so i thought i just fetch the data once and get it from the store
[04:06:52] <xec_> dawin: you could make an object with a save and a get method for instance, so you wouldnt have to worry about the "locaStore" scoped var http://jsfiddle.net/whWrR/2/
[04:07:41] <dawin> wow
[04:07:47] <dawin> THX this looks really nice
[04:08:49] <dawin> xec_: thanks for real, this is something i didnt know at all :)
[04:09:05] <xec_> yw :)
[04:09:59] <Nece228> a bit offtopic but
[04:10:01] <Nece228> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[04:10:10] <Nece228> what missing character that could be?
[04:12:05] <dawin> but what i dont understand is, the size of the array gets so huge http://jsfiddle.net/whWrR/3/
[04:12:22] <Nece228> $.getJSON('json.php',{check: true}, retrieve);
[04:12:30] <Nece228> showing unexpected identifier
[04:12:53] <xec_> Nece228: maybe the previous line?
[04:13:38] <Nece228> well heres the full javascript code
[04:13:40] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/Edakx/
[04:13:55] <Nece228> im trying to play with brackets but it doesnt help out of ideas
[04:14:19] <xec_> lol
[04:14:29] <xec_> what is the } in front of the getJSON
[04:15:11] <xec_> end of retrieve?
[04:15:15] <xec_> try a semicolon?
[04:15:58] <dawin> xec_ did you check this out? http://jsfiddle.net/whWrR/3/ look at the size of the array :D
[04:16:16] <dawin> is this intended <.<
[04:16:38] <dawin> i realized this on my version to i came up with a workaround
[04:17:50] <Jaycob> why is indentifying browsers so damn hard. is there an easy way to simply get 1) a browser-specific name or id and b) a version number?
[04:18:20] <xec_> dawin: i assumed you'd start at 1 and increase, if you want arbitrary id's use an object as cache instead http://jsfiddle.net/whWrR/4/
[04:18:20] <dawin> i dont know is this a bug of firebug, or does the array scale as big as the array[id]
[04:18:24] <rethus> is there a way to get needed size of a iframe, and adjust the iframe-size to the hight, that didn't show any scrollbars ? http://jsfiddle.net/suther/XpCkn/
[04:19:28] <dawin> xec_: thanks again!
[04:20:55] <tomoyuki28jp> I tried to use `var ajaxLoding = true` to make an ajax request only once at the same time, but it does not work some how. (Sometimes few requests are made at the same time.) Is there any other good way?
[04:21:36] <Whirl3d> Jaycob, browsers are being added by the minute. The number of possible options is limitless without a concensus amongst browser makers. Not gonna happen
[04:22:14] <Larholm> Jaycob, do feature detection instead
[04:23:21] <Jaycob> ok, how do I do that?
[04:28:42] <Nece228> xec_: ah thanks, i put semicolon after } and it works
[04:30:05] <Nece228> now im wondering how to call that function
[04:30:15] <Nece228> retrieve () for some reason doesnt work
[04:36:08] <Whirl3d> var retrieve = function (data)
[04:42:39] <mathi> hi
[04:43:08] <mathi> I am using function "appendTo", but I want to have an effect, like a fade in, how can I achieve this?
[04:44:05] <iamntz> mathi: foo.hide().appendTo(bar).slideDown()
[04:44:11] <jpic> hi all, some code that is not mine does something like this $('select#id_dependencies').append('<option value="9999" selected="selected"></option>'), but it doesn't seem to fire $('select#id_dependencies').change, any idea how i could catch it ? (without timer please :()
[04:44:31] <iamntz> mathi: or fadeIn() or whateva. the trick is to hide the element you want to add before adding
[04:45:11] <iamntz> jpic: try to use select.live('change', function(){}) instead
[04:45:14] <mathi> iamntz, is it possible to have a string for the effect to use, so that the effect can be configurable? fadein/slideup/slidedown/...
[04:45:31] <iamntz> jpic: or select.on('change', function() ...)
[04:45:57] <iamntz> mathi: dunno
[04:47:40] <jpic> iamntz: nope
[04:49:35] <iamntz> jpic: wait, you are expecting to get a a „change” trigger when you append an option?
[04:57:53] <dawin> erm how can you call $.each with not first?
[04:58:34] <xec_> if (i === 0) return;
[04:58:52] <xec_> as your 1st line in the each, assuming i is your index ;)
[04:59:43] <dawin> nice thanks :)
[05:00:03] <dawin> well i had if (i !== 0) in mind xD
[05:00:16] <dawin> thought maybe there is a option direct in the selector :P
[05:00:28] <Zauberfisch> greetings, I am trying to overwrite the _getBricks method of https://github.com/desandro/masonry/blob/master/jquery.masonry.js
[05:00:42] <Zauberfisch> what would be the best way to do it?
[05:00:55] <Zauberfisch> I tried jQuery.Mason._getBricks = function() { .. }
[05:01:44] <Zauberfisch> which seems to work as far as to actually overwrite the metod, but in my overwritten method I can not call for example this.options to access the pulgin options
[05:01:48] <xec_> dawin: you could remove the first item from your collection before iterating of course
[05:02:04] <dawin> but again xec_ your option is just better cause 0 is there once, mine would just check longer
[05:02:28] <dawin> xec_ this is on json wich i cant touch cause i cache it ^
[05:02:38] <ravenzz> Zauberfisch extend maybe
[05:03:07] <dawin> i === 0 is ok :D
[05:06:46] <Zauberfisch> ravenzz thanks, I'll have a look
[05:09:29] <NCS_One> how do I prevent the loading of .js and .css files on a ajax request?
[05:09:54] <Nece228> hmm i dont know
[05:09:55] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/43609112
[05:10:06] <Nece228> retrieve(data) doesnt work
[05:10:27] <ravenzz> what is supposed to do?
[05:10:39] <Nece228> call a function called retrieve
[05:10:50] <ravenzz> also you are calling it outside the ajax callback
[05:10:59] <ravenzz> so you won't be able to use data
[05:11:29] <Zauberfisch> ravenzz sweet, thanks, it works
[05:11:32] <Nece228> heres my full code
[05:11:34] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/99127107
[05:11:36] <Zauberfisch> is there also a way to call the parent method?
[05:11:47] <Zauberfisch> like the one I just have overwritten
[05:11:59] <Zauberfisch> what I did so far is: $.Mason.prototype._oldGetBricks = $.Mason.prototype._getBricks
[05:12:17] <Zauberfisch> and then in the extend call this._oldGetBricks()
[05:12:25] <Zauberfisch> but is there a nicer way to do it?
[05:14:58] <Nece228> ravenzz: do you see something wrong in here?
[05:16:13] <ravenzz> Zauberfisch I am not sure but maybe $.extend(true, object1, object2) will merge them recursively
[05:16:31] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[05:16:38] <ravenzz> but I don't know how..I am a beginner in plugin development
[05:16:58] <Zauberfisch> ravenzz I don't see what you getting at
[05:19:17] <ravenzz> how did you extended it?
[05:20:13] <ravenzz> Nece228 have you tried to put retrieve(data); within the ajax callback?
[05:20:30] <ravenzz> $.post('delete.php', {value: $(this).attr('value')}, function(data) { retrieve(data) });
[05:21:14] <Nece228> yeah i tried
[05:21:16] <Nece228> still the same
[05:22:05] <Nece228> i actually want on button press to execute ajax and later refresh the page
[05:22:36] <Nece228> by saying refresh i mean re execute the first function
[05:22:52] <Nece228> which now i called retrieve, to re show the results
[05:23:29] <xec_> Nece228: how much of this works as of now?
[05:23:45] <Nece228> it works fine, shows all the data
[05:23:57] <xec_> ok, what doesnt work
[05:24:15] <Nece228> but when i click on button to send data to server (to remove entry from mysql) it removes it fine but the page doesnt change after a click
[05:24:26] <Nece228> so i need to refresh the page to actually no longer show the deleted entry
[05:25:02] <xec_> Nece228: does the delete.php send back the new table?
[05:25:15] <Nece228> hmm good answer
[05:25:21] <Nece228> it doesnt send back
[05:25:40] <xec_> ok, then you'd need to remove the row from the dom yourself
[05:25:41] <jonathancutrell> Nece228: You could always remove it manually as long as you know the request was successful. Less db calls that way.
[05:25:42] <Nece228> i need to use json.php to output new table
[05:26:33] <Nece228> ah i get it
[05:38:02] <kevwilde> what is the use of wrapping a function in $(..) ?
[05:40:34] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: I'm assuming you're referring to $(function(){ //code here });
[05:40:38] <kevwilde> yes
[05:40:47] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: That's basically a shortcut to doc ready
[05:41:05] <kevwilde> ah
[05:41:22] <kevwilde> do you have any experience with jquery mobile and phonegap?
[05:41:25] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: I prefer using self-invoking anonymous functions.
[05:41:35] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: Not much. What are you trying to do?
[05:42:09] <kevwilde> i am using seperate html files for each page, but when i go from one to the other, the document.ready code isn't executed
[05:42:33] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: jQuery mobile uses a different event for that.
[05:42:37] <jonathancutrell> one sec
[05:43:14] <jonathancutrell> You'll want to use the pageshow event
[05:43:45] <shoky> hy wat is webdev?
[05:43:46] <kevwilde> thanks, i'll google that
[05:44:01] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde:
[05:44:03] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[05:44:13] <kevwilde> yea, reading that page :) thanks
[05:44:38] <Flo0815> hey, i'm fading in 3 elements. After all Elements are done fading in i want to execute another function. How can i do that? with callback in fadeIn it's executed 3 times (because of 3 fading elements)
[05:46:24] <jonathancutrell> Flo0815: Easiest way is to make a single selection for all the elements
[05:46:43] <jonathancutrell> Flo0815: $(el1).add(el2).fadeIn(function(){ //do other thing here })
[05:47:16] <Flo0815> cant do this, because the number of fading elements is dynamic
[05:47:25] <Flo0815> so i dont know how many elements there are
[05:47:48] <Whirl3d> $.when @flo815
[05:48:05] <kevwilde> jonathancutrell: it works in my browser, but it doesn't work in phonegap :(
[05:48:39] <Flo0815> i think i'll check with a counter, which increases in every callback, and if its equal to the number of fading elements, it'll do the callback function
[05:48:40] <mathi> hi
[05:48:53] <jonathancutrell> kevwilde: Hm. I'm not familiar with phonegap unfortunately.
[05:48:59] <mathi> how do I call a method of a widget with parameters?
[05:49:06] <kevwilde> jonathancutrell: ok, thanks for you help, though :)
[05:49:06] <mathi> I can call without parameters like this: $("#foo").my_widget("run");
[05:49:18] <mathi> but how can I specify a parameter?
[05:49:29] <Flo0815> "run" is a parameter
[05:49:38] <mathi> Flo0815, run is a function
[05:49:40] <jonathancutrell> mathi: I would imagine as an object.
[05:50:07] <jonathancutrell> mathi: $("#foo").my_widget({ someParam : run, someOtherParam: foo });
[05:50:14] <jonathancutrell> (with quotations)
[05:50:46] <mathi> jonathancutrell, so the widget knows the first param is the function name, and the following the parameters of that function?
[05:51:02] <mathi> sounds strange
[05:51:04] <jonathancutrell> mathi: No clue.
[05:51:16] <jonathancutrell> mathi: What "widget" are you referring to?
[05:51:36] <mathi> jonathancutrell, my own widget with the UI widget factory
[05:51:39] <Flo0815> Whirl3d: so like $.when($('.elementclass').fadeIn(1000)).then(function(){callbackfunctionstuff});
[05:51:40] <mathi> like a plugin
[05:52:44] <mathi> jonathancutrell, I have seen this on stackoverflow:  jQuery('#my_div').my_widget('do_something', ['arg1','arg2'])
[05:52:47] <mathi> I'll try this
[05:53:11] <jonathancutrell> mathi: Yeah, that makes sense. Also, may want to check out ajpiano's http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory

[05:56:49] <Flo0815> :)
[05:56:56] <shoky> $.when is the same ;)
[05:57:10] <Flo0815> never used it before too :)
[05:57:25] <Flo0815> cool, thank you

[06:01:57] <shoky> in all likelihood
[06:02:10] <kevwilde> jonathancutrell: the pageshow does not work when i transition to the page, it only works when i load it in browser
[06:05:15] <shoky> hmm
[06:06:01] <shoky> so how come $.when( $('.someclass') ) also works
[06:07:07] <shoky> well cause it has a promise i guess. but its not a deferred, is it
[06:07:13] <shoky> HM

[06:12:13] <tomoyuki28jp> shoky: You mean this? jQuery('html,body').queue([]).stop();
[06:12:27] <tomoyuki28jp> Above code does not work perfect unfortunatelly.
[06:12:44] <shoky> no need for .queue

[06:25:05] <darkangel> I don't understand how to set options for this plug-in: http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/js/lightbox.js
[06:25:42] <Danneh_> Oh, I'm an idiot
[06:26:31] <Danneh_> Protip: If you use URL rewriting so you can go to example.com/page1 instead of page1.html, make sure your appcache entries just say example.com/page1
[06:27:03] <Danneh_> mine said page1.html, which is why the AJAX fetching wasn't working properly
[06:28:24] <johnkpaul> darkangel: that isn't made as a regular jquery plugin
[06:28:42] <bittyx-work> hi all. i would like, using $.post, to send a form to the server. i would also like the sent data to be exactly the same as if the form was normally submitted (ie. without javascript). however, functions like .serialize() and .serializeArray() don't quite work for me, i can't find the submit button in the results of calling those functions
[06:28:46] <bittyx-work> anyone have any tips>?
[06:28:49] <darkangel> johnkpaul: Ya I see, but I still don't know how to set the optons.
[06:28:55] <darkangel> > options
[06:29:14] <johnkpaul> you'd have to do it manually in the source, I don't believe there is a seam for you to override them
[06:29:29] <johnkpaul> also, that 3rd to last line is returning the lightbox to nowhere
[06:29:57] <darkangel> johnkpaul: That sucks, think I might choose another plug-in.
[06:29:57] <jonathancutrell> darkangel: I may recommend fancybox.
[06:29:59] <johnkpaul> bittyx-work: you'll need to add the submit button that was cliekd manually to the output of serialize
[06:30:09] <poppiez> I'm using YUI compressor for my javascript, which works great. in my code I have a App.debug = true, which I want to be false when compressing. any way to do this with YUI?
[06:30:21] <johnkpaul> yes, darkangel, I aree with jonathancutrell, if you don't _have_ to use this, don't use this
[06:30:21] <bittyx-work> (i have more than one submit button, and they're defined like submit[0], submit[1] - i need it like this so i'd know which submit button was clicked)
[06:30:33] <darkangel> johnkpaul: kk, thx.
[06:30:35] <johnkpaul> bittyx-work: yes, I know what you mean, you'll have to manually handle that
[06:31:03] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: Got a particularly interesting issue with IE you might be able to advise on
[06:31:13] <johnkpaul> poppiez: YUI by itself is just a compressor, you need something in your build process to do that
[06:31:23] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: what's going on?
[06:31:44] <poppiez> johnkpaul: gotcha. will implement that now then :) thx
[06:31:55] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul - SCRIPT3: Member not found
[06:32:22] <bittyx-work> johnkpaul: that's what i thought, i just came to ask if there was a quicker way (ideally, i'd love something like: var $form = $('form#myForm'); $.post(url, $form.toPost()).done( ... ) ... )
[06:32:36] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: more details one sec
[06:32:36] <bittyx-work> johnkpaul: thank you.
[06:32:56] <jonathancutrell> johnkpaul: I've got a link but I'd rather not share out in the open - mind if I PM it to you?
[06:33:10] <johnkpaul> bittyx-work: no problem,  you can make something like that yourself
[06:33:13] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: go ahead
[06:33:59] <bittyx-work> johnkpaul: sure i can, but i wouldn't want to do it if it already exists. thanks again.
[06:40:12] <Logikos> if i have this: $('#autotabs ul li:first').addClass('active');  running when a script initalizes .. but have 2 <ul> tags within #autotabs ... how do i make it apply the class 'active' to the first li within each ul tag within the #autotabs id
[06:40:58] <Flo0815> when using $.when(function(){//do sth.}).then(function(){alert('done');}); the first function won't be executed. Why?
[06:41:15] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: $.when takes deferreds as arguments, not functions
[06:41:16] <shoky> cause you didn't execute it
[06:41:42] <Flo0815> shoky: how do i execute it?
[06:41:47] <Flo0815> .() ?
[06:42:10] <shoky> (), yes. but as johnkpaul said, that's now how you use $.when
[06:42:27] <jonathancutrell> When is just a register function, right?
[06:42:35] <shoky> register?
[06:42:42] <jonathancutrell> as in, it just registers a listener?
[06:42:49] <jonathancutrell> these are broad terms
[06:42:50] <jonathancutrell> haha
[06:42:56] <Flo0815> so whats a better solution? i fadeIn 3 elements and i want execute another function, when all elements are done fading
[06:43:04] <shoky> it gets/creates a promise object
[06:43:05] <johnkpaul> jonathancutrell: a register function?
[06:43:09] <johnkpaul> I think you're thinking of bind
[06:43:36] <Martz_> good afternoon all
[06:43:41] <johnkpaul> $.when(deferred1, deferred2, deferred3) creates a new deferred object that wraps all three of the internal ones
[06:43:50] <shoky> Flo0815: either what i told you before (.promise)  or  $.when( $('.fader') ).then(  ... )
[06:43:54] <johnkpaul> so when they are all resolved, then the new deferred object will be resolved
[06:44:41] <Martz_> Iam make a prototype, and i want to Simulate a upload bar, so all i basicly want is a div with 100% width, and 20px height to hide from left to right, anyone knows if thats possible? I've tried using jquery UI, but then i get all kind of errors
[06:45:10] <shoky> sure it's possible.. and jquery ui has a nice progress bar
[06:45:16] <shoky> dont know what an 'upload bar' is
[06:45:42] <Martz_> well i want to simulate 'uploading a file'
[06:45:50] <shoky> progress bar, then
[06:45:58] <Martz_> so what i want is a bar, that fills up in like 2 sec
[06:46:11] <Martz_> but i dont want to connect it to a real upload
[06:46:16] <shoky> progress bar, then
[06:46:31] <Martz_> is that a plugin? or a jquery function?
[06:46:38] <shoky> jqueryui.com
[06:46:43] <Martz_> ah ya
[06:46:50] <Martz_> well i've just tried using jqueryUI
[06:46:56] <Martz_> but then i got all these errors
[06:47:00] <Flo0815> johnkpaul: derefferd1, 2 and 3 are the fading elements? so like: $.when($('#element1'), $('#element2')).then()  or $.when($('.fadingelements')).then() ?
[06:47:04] <shoky> if you have a problem with it we are listening
[06:47:12] <Martz_> iam btw also using jquery mobile
[06:47:23] <Martz_> iam not sure if that conflicts with jquery UI?
[06:47:49] <shoky> Flo0815: either of those would work i believe
[06:47:50] <Martz_> shoky: i get this error if i use jquery UI: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[06:48:18] <shoky> did you include jquery
[06:48:22] <Martz_> yea
[06:48:31] <shoky> before jquery ui ?
[06:48:35] <Martz_> yea
[06:48:39] <shoky> ?paste
[06:48:40] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:48:59] <Martz_> its alot, but sure ^^
[06:49:05] <shoky> no need for a lot
[06:49:12] <shoky> the bare minimum that shows the problem
[06:49:26] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: those aren't deferred objects, and I dn't believe that animations return deferred objects
[06:49:33] <shoky> jkp it works
[06:49:37] <Martz_> @ shoky ok
[06:49:58] <johnkpaul> shoky: oh, great, I didn't know that
[06:50:02] <shoky> jquery objects have a deferred attached to them
[06:50:10] <shoky> the one you get from .promise()
[06:50:24] <shoky> i guess that's what $.when is 'attaching' to
[06:50:42] <shoky> but they should state this clearer in the docs
[06:52:18] <Nece228> how to select parent element?
[06:52:26] <shoky> .parent()
[06:52:26] <Nece228> i have button which is in td element
[06:52:28] <jorts> .parent()
[06:52:57] <Nece228> i want to select td in which that button is
[06:53:03] <aca20031> .parent()
[06:53:06] * aca20031 facepalms
[06:53:10] <jcrawford> back
[06:53:30] <Nece228> yeah sorry
[06:53:37] <Nece228> i was writing all the lines without reading
[06:53:42] <shoky> Nece228 maybe you want .closest('td')
[06:54:01] <shoky> hm or just .parent() ye
[06:54:48] <mathi> hey
[06:54:56] <Nece228> .parent works fine thanks
[06:55:28] <mathi> I have bound several elements to the click event, like : x.bind('click', $.proxy(this.close, this)); y.bind('click', $.proxy(this.close, this)); z.bind('click', $.proxy(this.close, this)); ...
[06:55:43] <mathi> is there a way to unbind all the elements of the click event?
[06:55:56] <mathi> at once
[07:00:46] <jonathancutrell> mathi: Do you know what all events are bound?
[07:00:53] <Nece228> btw how to dig even further with .parent
[07:01:04] <Nece228> i need to select parent's parent
[07:01:11] <jonathancutrell> mathi: also, you could bind the event to an ancestor element
[07:01:26] <jonathancutrell> mathi: and just narrow the scope
[07:01:38] <mathi> thanks i'll try that
[07:02:08] <jonathancutrell> mathi: You can always collect the elements you're binding to, and then unbind them all. .off("click")
[07:02:28] <mathi> jonathancutrell, by the way, in my widget I always do things like: "this.element.find("img.close")" repeatedly, I'm not sure where I can store a variable, like a member variable of a class
[07:03:19] <mathi> I could store this.element.find("img.close") in a variable, then use that variable, but I don't know where to store that variable
[07:04:02] <mmissions> Is there a way to listens for changes in a document? Id like to trigger an i18n callback on any elements that are inserted into the DOM or modified in place.
[07:04:04] <shoky> yeah johnkpaul i see that $.when treats the arguments as deferred if they have a .promise() function
[07:04:11] <jonathancutrell> mathi: The only way I could really help you is if you could isolate what you're trying to do.
[07:04:28] <jonathancutrell> mathi: and show the world on jsfiddle or something. :)
[07:05:02] <jonathancutrell> mmissions: You can do a few things there - do you know when and how things are inserted?
[07:06:08] <mmissions> jonathancutrell: Well, I am doing the insertion. I could manually invoke the i18n on the stuff I am changing, but I thought it would be nice if I could set this up with a single call, rather than invoking i18n from all over the app.
[07:06:42] <flying_fortress> back
[07:06:55] <jonathancutrell> mmissions: There are ways of modifying the default behavior. You could write your own dom insertion wrapper that includes the i18 stuff
[07:07:00] <mathi> jonathancutrell, http://jsfiddle.net/mvPxt/
[07:07:40] <mmissions> jonathancutrell: Is there a single point in jquery that I could override/wrap that would cache everything? replace, html, append, etc.
[07:07:48] <jonathancutrell> mathi: You could wrap the whole thing in a self invoking anonymous function
[07:07:54] <mmissions> s/cache/catch
[07:07:59] <mathi> jonathancutrell, wrap what?
[07:08:13] <jonathancutrell> mathi- one sec, I'll edit your fiddle
[07:08:41] <Nece228> $(this).parent().parent().remove();
[07:08:49] <Nece228> does this line look good?
[07:08:54] <shoky> yes
[07:09:08] <jonathancutrell> mathi: the "this" in those functions refers to the function, correct? or does it refer to the element the widget is called on?
[07:09:09] <Nece228> using .parent two times seems a bit like ugly
[07:09:22] <mathi> jonathancutrell, "this" is the widget
[07:09:23] <shoky> depends
[07:09:33] <jonathancutrell> mathi: what exactly is the element you are trying to get to?
[07:09:39] <mathi> jonathancutrell, you see, I want to use a variable all over the widget
[07:10:10] <mathi> jonathancutrell, an image inside the element that is linked to the widget
[07:10:16] <mathi> it is just an example
[07:10:20] <jonathancutrell> mathi: ah ok
[07:10:25] <mathi> I mean, I would like to use variables
[07:10:36] <mathi> instead of always traversing this.element
[07:10:40] <mathi> how to use variables in widget?
[07:11:18] <jonathancutrell> mathi: I'm assuming there is probably an init function, and you could probably use the function as an object to attach the child element to.
[07:11:40] <jonathancutrell> mmissions: Are you using all of those methods?
[07:11:58] <mathi> it's just an example, I would never use a function called "myFunction1" :)
[07:12:08] <jonathancutrell> mathi: I figured.
[07:12:32] <jonathancutrell> mathi: But I'm assuming there is some kind of initialization function that those widgets use to get stuff set up that you could hook into.
[07:12:49] <mathi> there is a _create method where I want to store things in variables, but outside the scope of _create i lose the variables
[07:12:58] <mmissions> jonathancutrell: Top of my head, not sure, but I wouldnt be happy about setting this up for only a subset of the DOM manipulation methods. Theres no single point in jquery that all the DOM manip passes through?
[07:13:00] <mathi> I want variables to have scope inside the widget
[07:13:18] <mathi> jonathancutrell, it's either _create or init, i'm using _create
[07:13:30] <jonathancutrell> mmissions: I would assume no - simply because all dom manipulations are different. But, gimme a min
[07:13:43] <mmissions> thanks for help
[07:13:48] <jonathancutrell> mmissions: anytime
[07:13:54] <jonathancutrell> mmissions: well, limited.
[07:13:59] <mmissions> heh
[07:14:00] <mathi> jonathancutrell, I can do this:   var close = this.element.find("img.close");  in _create
[07:14:09] <mathi> but how do I use variable "close" in other functions?
[07:14:39] <jonathancutrell> mathi: you could define a function that returns that element.
[07:14:53] <jonathancutrell> mathi: declare the variable
[07:14:54] <jonathancutrell> and then
[07:15:19] <mathi> jonathancutrell, in the function do this.element.find("img.close") ? there would be no difference
[07:15:22] <jonathancutrell> use a function to either return the cached variable or traverse and save it.
[07:15:31] <jonathancutrell> there would be if you save it to a variable.
[07:15:47] <jonathancutrell> however, you'll still need to make it unique somehow.
[07:15:58] <ha6aha6a> hello
[07:16:02] <jonathancutrell> probably store it in an array with some sort of key.
[07:16:10] <mathi> jonathancutrell, I think there is an easy way to use variables in widgets, i need to look up examples...
[07:16:12] <jonathancutrell> mathi: really you need to figure out if there's an init.
[07:16:21] <mathi> jonathancutrell, i told you there is
[07:16:34] <johnkpaul> shoky: oh I see, thanks for letting me know!
[07:16:39] <jonathancutrell> mathi: Ah ok - missed that
[07:17:16] <mathi> jonathancutrell, the problem is that I don't know how javascript works, I think there is an easy way to declare a variable inside the widget:)
[07:17:30] <jonathancutrell> mathi: indeed.
[07:17:36] <ha6aha6a> i am making a call to a php function from jquery meaning i am calling a url. i am using $.ajax. my problem with this is that i have to take care of the result within the same page. but i don't want to do this. i want the url that i call take over and render another page. is that possible?
[07:17:47] <jonathancutrell> mathi: You're probably dealing with a scope issue.
[07:17:53] <mathi> yes
[07:18:02] <jonathancutrell> be back in a few
[07:18:33] <shoky> ha6aha6a: then why use ajax
[07:19:25] <ha6aha6a> shoky i don't know what else to use. i am new to jquery. i don't know how else to call this function...
[07:19:47] <shoky> just redirect to that php
[07:19:58] <shoky> location.href = 'bla.php'
[07:20:34] <ha6aha6a> shoky i have to serialize a form and pass it to the function. is that possible?
[07:20:49] <shoky> you can just submit the form
[07:21:38] <ha6aha6a> shoky thank you very much. i will test this
[07:23:29] <ha6aha6a> shoky: 	location.href = 'bla.php' this worked :-) now let's see the form submition
[07:24:38] <mathi> jonathancutrell, something like this maybe?  http://jsfiddle.net/mvPxt/2/
[07:25:46] <shoky> mathi do you want this variable to be per instance of your widget? or shared for all instances ?
[07:25:53] <velcrobots> ok, having some trouble implementing this sort of slideshow.  check out this link.  when hovering over a single image, i want the overlay to pop up.  then when you click on it, i want it to stay "selected" (with the overlay on it).

[07:26:22] <mathi_> jonathancutrell, I got disconnected, did you receieve my message?
[07:26:29] <shoky> mathi do you want this variable to be per instance of your widget? or shared for all instances ?
[07:26:40] <Logikos> when useing $('#id nav ul li')each(function(i){ $(this).find('a').click(function(){     });    }); ... i have 2 'nav ul' 's within #id ... that are the same, one a tthe top and one at the bottom for page navigation ... i want to set the parrent of the clicked 'a' to class="active" but i want the same index'd li of the other nav ul to be set to active also
[07:26:42] <mathi_> shoky, only for that widget
[07:26:44] <Logikos> how can i do that?
[07:26:48] <mathi_> not all instances
[07:26:53] <mathi_> just that instance
[07:27:09] <shoky> mathi then use this.close = ...
[07:27:10] <mathi_> shoky, can I do this?  http://jsfiddle.net/mvPxt/2/
[07:27:14] <mathi_> ah
[07:27:26] <mathi_> shoky, what about my jsfiddle?
[07:27:44] <shoky> that's a shared variable i think
[07:27:51] <shoky> donno much bout widget factory, sorry
[07:28:08] <mathi_> shoky, I think it's not about widget factories, but about objects and scope
[07:28:44] <velcrobots> i imagine i need a "this" somewhere?
[07:30:36] <raj> resizing a jquery-ui dialog sucks in ff for everyone right?

[07:45:28] <beancurd> td
[07:45:37] <Logikos> can someone please tell me why this is not working as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/465Uf/
[07:45:47] <Logikos> no mater which one i click it says its the index of -1
[07:45:58] <Logikos> i want the index of the li
[07:46:41] <shoky> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hu3Pz/38/
[07:46:59] <Ghan> how do i get all the values of these div's and add them together and show them? http://jsfiddle.net/V4VzP/
[07:47:06] <xec_> Logikos: your comment is mistaken - "this" is the nav
[07:48:06] <johnkpaul> Logikos: $(event.target).closest("li").index()
[07:48:07] <Logikos> xec_ that code is a slightly altered version of the example found here: http://api.jquery.com/index/
[07:48:09] <johnkpaul> should do what you're looking for
[07:48:13] <Logikos> the comment comes from api.jquery.com
[07:48:33] <Logikos> i'll give it a try, ty johnkpaul
[07:48:35] <xec_> Logikos: because that's what you bound the click handler to
[07:49:00] <xec_> Logikos: you could bind to the li instead http://jsfiddle.net/465Uf/1/
[07:49:15] <Logikos> xec_ .. oh duh .. sorry ... lol
[07:50:37] <velcrobots> shoky: you are awesome!  thanks so much.  I have one more question - what's keeping the image "selected?"  Is it the overlay class added? The reason I ask is that we want to be able to preselect one of these lists with a url parameter.  I can handle the PHP part to add a class to a certain div if we pass one, just need to figure out which class.  Seems like overlay
[07:51:11] <shoky> the overlay class is what's keeping it from sliding down on 'mouseout'
[07:51:18] <shoky> where i wrote:  if (el.hasClass('overlay')) return;
[07:51:28] <Logikos> xec_: if i had 2 sets of <nav> 's with the ul li a markup in it ... identical to eachother ... my end goal is to apply a class="active" both to the parrent of the a clicked (being the li it is inside) and to the same index of the other instance of the <nav> markup
[07:51:43] <Logikos> so when the 2nd li of one is set to active the 2nd li of the other will be set to active
[07:51:51] <Logikos> how might i achive that please?
[07:52:13] <velcrobots> ok so if I add a class of "overlay" dynamically to the div with the "item" class
[07:52:22] <xec_> Logikos: make a demo with some markup, maybe easier to understand what you mean
[07:53:03] <shoky> velcrobots: just adding the class wont help
[07:53:17] <velcrobots> ok so executing that one line of jquery
[07:53:26] <shoky> velcrobots: you'd need to do the slideUp too
[07:53:38] <Logikos> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/465Uf/2/
[07:53:43] <shoky> or just .show()  of the .holder
[07:53:51] <Logikos> i want it so when you click 1, both 1's set to active
[07:54:02] <Logikos> when you click 3, both 3's set to active ...
[07:54:36] <Logikos> which is why i was trying to grab index() ... now that i have it, i'm not sure what to do with it :\
[07:54:39] <velcrobots> ok so if you don't mind, walk me through this:  <?php if($_GET['listid'] == 'pools') { ?>
[07:55:20] <shoky> mm i don't think you wanna check for each id seperately ?
[07:55:40] <velcrobots> well we're only going to be passing one of five
[07:55:42] <velcrobots> out of like 50
[07:55:46] <velcrobots> just to maybe highlight them
[07:56:04] <shoky> when you;'re building your html in the php
[07:56:42] <andr0id1> helouuu :D
[07:57:04] <shoky> when you make the divs of each item, only on the selected item you should put that overlay class AND put display:block or whatever is needed for it to be visible
[07:57:08] <shoky> on the .holder i mean
[07:57:50] <shoky> or, you could just inject the ID parameter into javascript and handle it at runtime
[07:58:07] <andr0id1> little help please? :D
[07:58:14] <Ghan> could anyone help me adding numbers in stead of appending?
[07:58:15] <Ghan> http://jsfiddle.net/V4VzP/1/
[07:58:19] <pachet> ?ask @ andr0id1
[07:58:19] <bot-t> andr0id1, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:58:27] <shoky> andr0id1: eat healthy
[07:58:45] <Logikos> xec_ ?
[07:58:48] <andr0id1> ok, i am writing a function that shows alert on click, but the alert doesnt show when i click on the link
[07:59:20] <shoky> Ghan: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/V4VzP/2/
[07:59:28] <pachet> andr0id1: can you paste your code somewhere for us to look at?
[07:59:33] <andr0id1> yep
[07:59:34] <xec_> Logikos: i think you'd need to store the index, loop the navs, then find the index in each
[07:59:34] <velcrobots> shoky: ok, i'll try that.  one small thing i noticed, can we disable anything happening when clicking on an image that already is "selected?"
[07:59:56] <shoky> velcrobots: most anything is possible..
[08:00:02] <Ghan> thnx shoky… numbers was a string
[08:00:04] <Ghan> get it now
[08:00:16] <xec_> Logikos: i made a working version, but it's a bit hackish http://jsfiddle.net/465Uf/3/
[08:00:23] <termite> Ghan, http://jsfiddle.net/rich_h/SpwTG/
[08:00:40] <Ghan> thnx termite
[08:00:47] <carli2> hi
[08:00:53] <shoky> velcrobots: isnt that already disabled
[08:01:16] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/rymiSzYt
[08:01:27] <carli2> there is a control similar to the accordeon in the jquery-ui docs. is there a template for this?
[08:01:39] <andr0id1> when i click on the link, no alert
[08:01:55] <velcrobots> shoky: no, if you click on one that's selected, the overlay drops down and you can't do anythign else with that one
[08:01:57] <shoky> andr0id1: $('a')
[08:01:58] <pachet> andr0id1: $('a'), not $(a)
[08:02:11] <velcrobots> only thing that should deselect an overlay is clicking on anotherone
[08:02:13] <pachet> without the quotes, it's a variable identifier
[08:02:18] <pachet> which in your case would be undefined
[08:02:27] <shoky> velcrobots: ah right
[08:02:32] <xec_> Logikos: slightly better with .eq() instead of .get() http://jsfiddle.net/465Uf/4/
[08:02:37] <andr0id1> thank you :)
[08:03:07] <shoky> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hu3Pz/41/
[08:03:14] <shoky> i just added  .not(this)   :P
[08:03:25] <andr0id1> anyway, freenode channel #jquery is much better for getting help about jquery, not like those undernet pretencious b*****ds
[08:03:27] <shoky> prolly there are nicer ways
[08:03:28] <raj> shoky, how the hell did you google for a fiddle?
[08:03:32] <raj> nuts
[08:03:44] <shoky> ?g jquery ui dialog jsfiddle
[08:03:46] <bot-t> shoky, JQuery UI Dialog over PDF - jsFiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/dwaddell/J6CWM/
[08:03:50] <shoky> like dat
[08:04:00] <velcrobots> shoky: whatever works!  thx again.  curious as to how we'd "inject the ID parameter into javascript and handle it at runtime"
[08:04:03] <raj> nice dude
[08:04:23] <raj> anyway, it appears to be that if there are a lot of calculations to be done, FF has issues. Like, I have a lot of elements with percentages and some floated, some not
[08:04:37] <shoky> velcrobots:  'inject' is a fancy word for 'put' or 'pass' or 'hand down' or 'append' or whatever
[08:04:54] <raj> there's a delay, and it doesn't make a change until the mouse has stopped dragging
[08:05:03] <shoky> velcrobots: and 'handle it at runtime' is a fancy way of saying:  handle it in javascript when the page is loaded in the clientside
[08:05:14] <raj> anyway, those are problems for finishing touches I guess
[08:05:58] <velcrobots> ok so the PHP would grab the url parameter - say in out case the DIV id.  So, for example myurl.com?list=pools
[08:06:12] <andr0id1> another question: i asked what is better to learn, javascript or jquery, and they told me jquery, cause among people, jquery is known as simplified and better javascript. is that true?
[08:06:17] <velcrobots> before any javascript runs, we do a $_GET
[08:06:29] <velcrobots> and use that to set a var in jquery?
[08:06:43] <shoky> raj welp lemme know if you want me to take a looksee
[08:07:04] <shoky> ?learn @ andr0id1
[08:07:05] <bot-t> andr0id1, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[08:07:23] <andr0id1> :(
[08:07:26] <andr0id1> okey
[08:07:35] <pachet> andr0id1: its not a simplified and better javascript
[08:07:39] <shoky> you can do some jquery before you're a javascript ninja ;)
[08:07:43] <pachet> its a dom abstraction library
[08:07:59] <pachet> (primarily :[  )
[08:08:00] <shoky> velcrobots: sure, that works
[08:08:52] <velcrobots> ok so say using php i do something like
[08:09:21] <freeed> Hey all.. what is the best method to get an element child? I'm wondering if .children() or .find() is too much. i.e. $('.parent').doSomething().children('.child') when there is only one .child, seems like it may be overkill? Or am I over thinking this?
[08:09:27] <mmissions> jonathancutrell: Are au fair with source? Ive been looking at it, and I reckon all DOM manipulation is implemented in terms of these methods. Do you have any instinctive feeling whether Im right/wrong? .append(), .attr(), .html(), .prop(), .val()
[08:09:28] <velcrobots> var id = <?php $_GET['list']; ?>;
[08:09:47] <velcrobots> or is "id" a bad choice for a var name
[08:10:07] <mmissions> s/au fair/au fait
[08:10:34] <Logikos> xec_: thanks!
[08:10:42] <shoky> velcrobots: it's ok if its a small script and it wont confuse anyone
[08:10:48] <pachet> freeed: $('.parent').doSomething().children().doSomethingelse()
[08:11:12] <shoky> velcrobots: but 'listId' is probably better
[08:11:18] <velcrobots> shoky: ok.  so now we have a var named "id" set to our URL parameter.  where does that IF piece go?
[08:11:24] <freeed> patchet, ahh ok. Thanks
[08:11:24] <velcrobots> ok listID
[08:11:32] <freeed> *pachet^
[08:11:37] <shoky> velcrobots: in a $(document).ready handler
[08:12:18] <velcrobots> sorry for all the questions, i'm trying to understand this.  hate having people just do things for me, would love to figure this out myself
[08:12:40] <xec_> Logikos: you might also be able to use nth-child
[08:12:59] <shoky> velcrobots: it's fine
[08:13:30] <sorahn> what's the best way to check for 3 truths before continuing in jquery?
[08:13:49] <shoky> if ?
[08:14:11] <sorahn> i mean, is that really it? if(1 && 2 && 3) ?
[08:14:20] <shoky> yah
[08:14:25] <xec_> Logikos: http://jsfiddle.net/465Uf/6/
[08:17:56] <shoky> oK i believe it's time for game of thrones
[08:18:04] <xec_> sorahn: you can nest if's like a boss: if (1) { if (2) { if (3) { /* yay */ } } }
[08:18:10] <termite> Logikos, http://jsfiddle.net/rich_h/wuCEH/
[08:18:11] <xec_> much better imo
[08:18:18] <xec_> makes sure you keep your job
[08:18:24] <termite> don't know if  anyone answered or not
[08:18:25] <freeed> Anyone know why using .slideUp or down becomes jumpy when the element has a padding? I've set a width / height on the element..
[08:18:42] <sahbeewah> is there a way to distinguish between a user refreshing and a user leaving the page?
[08:19:53] <johnkpaul> sahbeewah: not in general, no, but if it's from a click of a link or something, you can tell the difference with some work
[08:19:59] <macmartine> I'm trying to submit a form via ajax, but the error handler keeps getting called, thought the status is 200 and statusText is "OK". Any idea why the it's going to the error handler instead of success? https://gist.github.com/2628349
[08:20:10] <macmartine> *though* the status....
[08:20:28] <johnkpaul> macmartine: what is the response type? is it valid javascript?
[08:20:32] <warrenparsons> freeed: It's because slideUp/Down doesn't include padding in its calculations. What version of jQuery are you using?
[08:21:02] <freeed> warrenparsons, ahhh - I'm using v1.7.2
[08:21:14] <sorahn> xec_: I don't think i really need to test.  Nothing is going to happen if all 3 aren't true.  My co-worker mentioned something about using deffered objects, so I wasn't sure if that was useful for this case.
[08:21:18] <macmartine> johnkpaul: Well, it's actually Rails rendering a partial.
[08:21:21] <sorahn> s/test/nest/g
[08:21:35] <freeed> warrenparsons, what would you suggest I do to include padding on the element? Use a child with margin or something?
[08:21:49] <velcrobots> shoky: would this work?  (see second doc ready function): http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/hu3Pz/43/
[08:21:50] <macmartine> johnkpaul: That's probably the problem, but not sure what to do
[08:22:00] <johnkpaul> then why is dataType "script"?
[08:22:03] <johnkpaul> @macmartine
[08:22:12] <warrenparsons> freeed: Yeah, something like that. Depending on your use case, you might be able to put a wrapper element on and slide that instead.
[08:22:28] <macmartine> johnkpaul: so that rails knows to use the js template
[08:22:28] <freeed> warrenparsons, ok - thanks!
[08:22:29] <xec_> sorahn: yeah my nesting was a joke ;) - deferreds are nice if you're working with multiple async tasks
[08:22:43] <shoky> velcrobots: i guess more like: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hu3Pz/45/
[08:22:54] <macmartine> johnkpaul: what do you suggest?
[08:23:15] <velcrobots> shoky: darn i missed the holder show piece
[08:23:16] <johnkpaul> macmartine: I don't know much about rails so I don't know how to best do what you're trying to do
[08:23:19] <velcrobots> makes sense though
[08:23:23] <velcrobots> i'll try it out
[08:23:28] <johnkpaul> you want rails to produce javascript on the fly, and have that executed
[08:23:29] <velcrobots> shoky: thx again for all your help
[08:23:31] <shoky> velcrobots: and maybe you'll need to add a '#'  before the id, donno
[08:23:34] <johnkpaul> ?getScript @macmartine
[08:23:35] <bot-t> macmartine, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[08:23:46] <velcrobots> yeah i'll test it out
[08:23:58] <sorahn> xec_: we are, but Im not sure if this is the right way to handle it.  We have 3 spine models being initialized, and each time one is updated, it triggers an 'updated' state, which I don't want to finish on the listener till all 3 are initialized.
[08:24:31] <macmartine> johnkpaul: I have another case where I do the same thing, though it's a GET request, and it works fine
[08:25:22] <johnkpaul> macmartine: my guess is that rails isn't returning what you expect it to
[08:26:40] <macmartine> johnkpaul: ah, got it. I just had a bad js call in my js template that got rendered. thanks
[08:27:00] <johnkpaul> no problem
[08:27:02] <xec_> sorahn: well, the old fashioned way is to keep track of the number of operations in a var, that is incremented when a task is started and decremented when one is done, then you can check if it's back to 0 on each "updated" event
[08:28:38] <sorahn> xec_: yea.  Right now i'm just checking for 3 booleans in each model that are only set to true once the model is initalized.  For example, the "user" model doesn't initialize if it's a guest user.
[08:28:49] <shoky> velcrobots: ah that should be .hide() not .show() i think
[08:29:03] <velcrobots> ok
[08:29:04] <sorahn> xec_: so my controller thats waiting for the 3 models shouldn't run if its a guest user.
[08:29:24] <jonathancutrell> Does sort or detach not work properly in firefox?
[08:30:40] <xec_> sorahn: sorry, this is becoming a bit too abstract to follow, i sort of got my brain half-melted on my own project atm ;) but you should definetely read up on deferreds, they can help out a lot with this sort of stuff
[08:31:30] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: wat?
[08:31:34] <sorahn> xec_: thanks, I'll check it out :)
[08:31:44] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: sort only sorts items in memory, not in the dom
[08:32:10] <ajpiano> and detach should work fine in all browsers
[08:32:14] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: nice article today
[08:32:19] <dawin> hi all
[08:32:33] <dawin> how can i check the next element of the target? $(this).next?
[08:32:35] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: I'm detaching and sorting some li's, then putting them back onto a ul.
[08:32:37] <boulet101010> Hi, I there a way to get a cleaner code using jquery? The fact is, with all these callbacks and anonym function and json objects, it's easy to be lost without a proper plan of what you're codin'.
[08:32:39] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: thanks. :)
[08:33:05] <dawin> i have a <a> and sometimes there is a <span> next to it
[08:33:12] <dawin> how can i check for this span? :S
[08:34:07] <tash> anyone used the tablesorter plugin before? http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[08:34:26] <pachet> dawin : if $('a').next().is('span')
[08:34:51] <dawin> yay thx pachet
[08:36:21] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: sounds like it should work, obvs i can't debug it without codelahoma
[08:36:25] <ajpiano> code* :|
[08:36:28] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: so basically I'm doing var $li = $("ul").children("li"); li.detach().sort() and then appending it back on.
[08:36:38] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: I do enjoy a good codelahoma sometimes.
[08:36:57] <ajpiano> you don't really have to detach first at all
[08:37:18] <velcrobots> shoky:any idea wht the mouseleave won't workonce on the page? http://bjtonline.com/lists
[08:37:19] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: ah, cause it does it in memory anyway.
[08:37:28] <ajpiano> ye
[08:37:45] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: perhaps it is the append call.
[08:38:15] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: typically i end up doing like, var ul = $("ul"), lis = ul.children("li").sort(fn);  ul.html( lis );
[08:39:01] <jonathancutrell> I'll update once it works correctly. For whatever reason, it works fine in Chrome. Firefox just hates me.
[08:39:04] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know of any good js rotator scripts?
[08:39:09] <ajpiano> bugger
[08:39:12] <ajpiano> is it throwing?
[08:39:13] <jonathancutrell> jeffreylevesque: eh. Nah
[08:39:18] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: not at all
[08:39:32] <ajpiano> boulet101010: there are many ways. organising your code into modules and objects really helps
[08:39:35] <boulet101010> anybody to help?
[08:39:38] <boulet101010> :]
[08:39:45] <ajpiano> boulet101010: having a crapload of anonymous callbacks and monster objects is not a requirement :)
[08:40:07] <ajpiano> boulet101010: having well defined modules with clearly marked dependencies can go along way
[08:40:14] <ajpiano> http://requirejs.org
[08:40:25] <dawin> hmm if you have a font-size of 12px, now big in pixel is a &nbsp; ? :D
[08:40:35] <dawin> how*
[08:40:42] <ajpiano> boulet101010: additionally many people find that using a client-side MVC framework can help
[08:40:51] <ajpiano> like backbone or canjs or emberjs etc etc
[08:41:02] <boulet101010> ajpiano: actually, that's what i'm trying to do by myself
[08:41:10] <ajpiano> you're trying to do what yourself?
[08:41:23] <boulet101010> to code in a MVC way
[08:41:33] <boulet101010> but without a framework
[08:41:33] <ajpiano> why not take a look at all the prior art
[08:41:40] <ajpiano> why
[08:41:56] <boulet101010> because this is my job, and my school
[08:42:15] <boulet101010> what you mean by "prior art" ?
[08:42:18] <pachet> his love... and his hate
[08:42:19] <pachet> rated R
[08:42:22] <ajpiano> ?define "prior art"
[08:42:27] <bot-t> ajpiano, Did you mean prorate?  - (verb) To divide proportionately, especially by day.
[08:42:46] <boulet101010> xD
[08:42:54] <ajpiano> boulet101010: loosely, it means "stuff that already exists in the space you are looking at"
[08:43:12] <en3r0> hello
[08:43:17] <ajpiano> boulet101010: i'm not sure what you mean by its's my job and my school
[08:43:23] <pachet> "pre-invented wheels that roll a lot smoother than yours will"
[08:43:31] <boulet101010> don't try to understand ajpiano , this is just the way my boss see the things
[08:43:36] <ajpiano> you're already using jQuery, so it's not like you're in a "no libraries allowed" scenario
[08:43:41] <lduros> hi, I change the src of my image when I click on a link, and I have img.onload = function () { doSomething(); }; -- that's not jquery, but IE doesn't trigger this after the image has been loaded once, and hence is then part of the cache. I'm trying to find a solution for jquery but haven't found anything that works, there's a lot of literature but I'm a bit confused... thanks
[08:43:42] <boulet101010> nope
[08:43:48] <boulet101010> but it's more like "less libraries allowed"
[08:44:00] <boulet101010> i got a closed minded old fashioned boss
[08:44:11] <ajpiano> is your boss even slightly aware of the technical considerations
[08:44:27] <ajpiano> or just flailing about with arbitrary requirements
[08:44:33] <boulet101010> my boss think she's a programmer but doesn't see the practical way, only the solution
[08:44:40] <boulet101010> with arbitrary requirement
[08:44:45] <ajpiano> the solution is "roll your own MVC?"
[08:44:56] <boulet101010> no, harder.
[08:45:00] <boulet101010> roll your own CMS
[08:45:05] <ajpiano> oh god
[08:45:07] <boulet101010> and i am apprentice
[08:45:10] <ajpiano> boulet101010: find a better job :|
[08:45:14] <boulet101010> but don't worry for me
[08:45:56] <pachet> roll your own OS
[08:45:57] <boulet101010> for know, i'm just looking for good examples of heavy use of jQuery with clean code, then i'll read them and learn from that
[08:46:25] <boulet101010> pachet: an OS is fun, a JS framework is hell (for me)
[08:46:35] <boulet101010> hell can be fun
[08:46:46] <boulet101010> but only if you "prior art"
[08:47:13] <boulet101010> ajpiano, are you dying under your desk?
[08:47:24] <johnkpaul> boulet101010: if you want a good example of jquery look at this https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/master/architecture-examples/jquery/js/app.js
[08:47:33] <ajpiano> boulet101010: https://github.com/rmurphey/srchr-demo
[08:47:34] <johnkpaul> if, when you say, "clean code" you mean unclebob style
[08:47:40] <ajpiano> also yeah, what johnkpaul listed
[08:47:47] <johnkpaul> then you should contact object mentor, I beleive that they have screencasts available for purchase
[08:47:49] <johnkpaul> about "clean" jquery
[08:47:49] <pachet> ajpiano is something of an expert in the field of prior art
[08:48:03] <pachet> and by prior art i mean first grade scribbles with incisive hindsight commentary
[08:48:09] <ajpiano> hhaha
[08:48:56] <boulet101010> johnkpaul: thanks for the link, and lol for object mentor
[08:49:03] <boulet101010> ty ajpiano
[08:49:43] <johnkpaul> :) np, I'm actually serious about object mentor btw, if you get those videos let me know what you think
[08:49:53] <JillesCode> Hey guys, is there anyone with experience with developing chrome plugins?
[08:49:57] * boulet101010 is proud to channelQuake #jQuery
[08:50:31] <boulet101010> I may not get them
[08:50:52] <boulet101010> Or not yet though
[08:52:02] <johnkpaul> I don't really want to see them for the content, more for the comedy
[08:52:45] <johnkpaul> JillesCode: I've done a little, but I'm pretty sure there's a channel for that
[08:52:50] <johnkpaul> #chrome-extensions maybe
[08:52:53] <ajpiano> JillesCode: i've also done it
[08:53:03] <ajpiano> it's #chromium-extensions
[08:53:05] <ajpiano> but it's very quiet there
[08:53:20] <lotus> Hey, so I have an interesting problem:  http://jsfiddle.net/V9eGM/  I'm trying to get this slide-out menu to work, and I have it adding the elements, but either it's so that when I hover off the expand-toggle menu item over to the new content, the content disappears OR it's so that when I hover off the current menu item to a new menu item (without an expand-toggle) then the content item remains...
[08:53:24] <johnkpaul> ah ok, yeah, I don't remember actually getting help there
[08:53:56] <johnkpaul> JillesCode: what's your question?
[08:55:00] <JillesCode> johnkpaul: I'm developing a page for my school, which has a lot of divs ('.cblock'), now I want to inject a script that scrolls to each cblock, waits 10 seconds and then goes to the next one
[08:55:17] <JillesCode> I wrote all the code, I just don't know how I "inject" it into my school page
[08:55:18] <boulet101010> thanks everybody, gonna come back soon if i get another difficulties with code organization :p xoxo
[08:55:43] <johnkpaul> JillesCode: https://gist.github.com/2378436
[08:55:46] <johnkpaul> you can use that as an example
[09:00:33] <Famic> how can you get the height of the visible part of an element ?
[09:01:02] <christo_m> has anyone tried styling the events for fullcalendar?
[09:01:12] <christo_m> inspecting the events i note that theyre placed and sized based on some js, which i dont want to modify
[09:01:30] <christo_m> im just trying to make events of a certain class take up full width, and nothing like width:100% !important or anything will do that.
[09:02:04] <dawin> oh yeah :D http://svzanten.home.xs4all.nl/ascii/animations/infamous.html <- check this out :D
[09:02:29] <lotus> 1figured it out.  Applied a noToggle class to the non-interesting list elements and removed the item on hoverOver  :D
[09:02:31] <JillesCode> johnkpaul: Mhmm thanks, but I honestly don't see how this would help me injecting a script from a chrome extension INTO the current page
[09:02:46] <dawin> good old ~1990 days of the internet :D
[09:03:07] <johnkpaul> JillesCode: that's exactly what that does, it injects the entireity of the main function into the context of the currently displayed window
[09:05:18] <raj> ajpiano, is jsfiddle yours?
[09:10:14] <barisc> hi
[09:10:28] <barisc> maybe beating the dead horse, but got a question about dom manipulation
[09:11:06] <barisc> i'm adding elements with $('<div/>').append($('<div/>')... etc.
[09:11:17] <barisc> on some blogs (mostly old though) it says that's slow
[09:11:58] <barisc> but i can't believe with new js interpreters, it should be an issue, as you're lessening the job of jquery and others creating DOM elements yourself
[09:12:12] <barisc> is there any updated documentation regarding this issue?
[09:12:52] <WebDragon> raj: join #jsfiddle (IIRC)
[09:13:03] <ajpiano> barisc: if you are worried about somethng being slow
[09:13:07] <ajpiano> benchmark it and test
[09:13:24] <raj> WebDragon, I'm there
[09:13:27] <raj> and I see ajpiano there
[09:13:27] <ajpiano> old blog posts with hearsay about whatever are *not* the same as bottlenecks in your app
[09:13:29] <raj> that's why I ask
[09:13:51] <WebDragon> I'd say "ah".. but that still doesn't explain things :)
[09:14:07] <barisc> ajpiano, i don't have perf issues. i just wonder the concept and if anyone knowledgeable get some insight
[09:14:09] <WebDragon> why do you ask ?
[09:14:20] <WebDragon> channel too quiet?
[09:14:25] <ajpiano> barisc: then there's your answer
[09:14:47] <ajpiano> my insight is optimize when you need to optimize and obviously, to know relatively what's fast and slow
[09:14:55] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffee™ over to ajpiano 
[09:14:57] <ajpiano> but generally $("<foo>") is not going to be a bottleneck in your app
[09:15:07] <ajpiano> raj: no it isn't
[09:15:13] <ajpiano> zalun is the guy
[09:15:34] <raj> oh
[09:15:41] <raj> do you ever see him active?
[09:15:54] <ajpiano> yes
[09:16:00] <nebiros> hi, there's a way to use a Range object as a selector?
[09:16:01] <WebDragon> I have, in the one or two instances where I had a question. just not all the time
[09:16:10] <barisc> ajpiano, for me it's lazy coding to do innerHTML or html('') to create content
[09:16:14] <raj> could you possibly request for an auto-indenting off checkbox?
[09:16:23] <barisc> ajpiano, it's not readable, prone to errors etc.
[09:16:29] <WebDragon> just paste question and wait. lather, rinse, repeat after a suitable long interval if no one else picks up the question
[09:16:30] <raj> it takes 3 times as long to write a script because of autoindenting
[09:16:40] <ajpiano> barisc: compared to what? using DOM methods?
[09:16:45] <barisc> ajpiano, yes
[09:16:50] <ajpiano> barisc: what about using templating?
[09:17:03] <ajpiano> $( someTemplateFunction({some: "data"}) );
[09:17:18] <barisc> ajpiano, that depend what someTemplateFunction would do
[09:17:23] <ajpiano> return a string of html
[09:17:36] <ajpiano> like basically every single templating library does
[09:17:56] <barisc> ajpiano, same, it creates a html string instead of dom elements
[09:17:59] <ajpiano> so what
[09:18:11] <ajpiano> creating elements with html strings has long been much faster than using DOM methods
[09:18:22] <ajpiano> it's only in like, really new chrome and such that DOM has gotten nearly as fast
[09:18:33] <barisc> ajpiano, yeap
[09:18:46] <barisc> ajpiano, it *used* to be faster, that's what I know
[09:18:55] <ajpiano> using templating keeps the physical html strings out of your JS code
[09:19:00] <barisc> ajpiano, probably it's still is, but not significatnly
[09:19:04] <ajpiano> so in that way it really solves maintainability
[09:19:21] <ajpiano> barisc: ie6-8 haven't magically gotten faster, however
[09:19:24] <Doddlin> hi all! Could someone tell me why the following does not work? http://jsfiddle.net/YU5gb/
[09:19:39] <Doddlin> it's a Formidable Pro form which needs a basic calculation to be done
[09:19:45] <ajpiano> Doddlin: parseInt("val1") is not the same as parseInt(val)
[09:19:47] <barisc> ajpiano, i'd rather ignoring ie6-8 and warn user 'use better browser'
[09:19:58] <ajpiano> ?csb @ barisc
[09:20:06] <barisc> ajpiano, I know that's not most websites can afford
[09:20:09] <WebDragon> ajpiano: actually I've been meaning to ask you something.. there was a conversation we had a while back involving obj[variable]() where you'd suggested I could use that for my next/prev cycler in this slideshow app
[09:20:21] <WebDragon> you'd said " <ajpiano> so that you could have just written $(".button").click(function() { var nextOrPrev = $(this)[this.name]();  }); "
[09:20:28] <Doddlin> ajpiano, sorry, int 1 & 2 is not used, forgot to remove those
[09:20:30] <ajpiano> Doddlin: you don't put a variable's name in quotes when you want to refer to the variable
[09:20:51] <WebDragon> I played with it a bit but still don't quite get it, and wondered if you knew of any examples of how that would be used, around anywhere
[09:21:07] <Doddlin> ajpiano, as you can see I use parseInt around val 1&2 instead
[09:21:07] <ajpiano> Doddlin: when you use parseInt you should always pass the second argument, the radix
[09:21:15] <ajpiano> ?mdc parseInt
[09:21:23] <ajpiano> that tells it to always use base 10
[09:21:31] <barisc> ajpiano, what's ?csb ?
[09:21:37] <WebDragon> bot missing
[09:21:44] <ajpiano> barisc: it was supposed to link you to a Cool Story, Bro animated gif
[09:21:47] <ajpiano> but the bot is sleeping :(
[09:21:54] <WebDragon> heh
[09:22:07] <CharlieM751> so I'm trying to serialize the inputs inside of a div, and it keeps returning an empty string.. maybe I'm doing something wrong? jQuery('#myId').closest('.someClass').find('input').serialize()
[09:22:12] <CharlieM751> the find input works though
[09:22:13] <ajpiano> WebDragon: what about it don't you get
[09:22:16] <CharlieM751> any ideas?
[09:22:30] <ajpiano> CharlieM751: do your inputs have name attributes
[09:22:34] <Doddlin> ajpiano, what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/YU5gb/1/
[09:23:01] <ajpiano> Doddlin: i donno how you expect me to see that it isn't working when you aren't loading jquery nad there isn't any html to support it.
[09:23:03] <ajpiano> how is it breaking
[09:23:17] <WebDragon> I'm missing something I can't put my finger on (and I'm fairly sure it's really obvious to the rest of you)
[09:23:19] <Doddlin> what I try to do, for some clarification, is to just total 2 fields and output the total in a read-only field
[09:23:24] <CharlieM751> they're using id's, need to be names?
[09:23:56] <ajpiano> CharlieM751: yes, look at the docs for seralize it clearly states that it has to have a name attr to be serialized
[09:24:05] <ajpiano> Doddlin: that much is clear
[09:24:15] <WebDragon> I've got $("#slidebar_controls #playpause") (and #left/#right) so I was thinking var controls = $(this)[this.id]();
[09:24:20] <CharlieM751> thanks, ill add that to my taglib
[09:24:39] <ajpiano> WebDragon: but there isn't a jQuery.fn.playpause
[09:24:40] <WebDragon> but I'm embarassed to admit I've no idea what to do next
[09:24:45] <ajpiano> there is a jQuery.fn.next
[09:24:57] <WebDragon> I'd have to define my own functions
[09:25:02] <ajpiano> you don't have to
[09:25:07] <ajpiano> WebDragon: i was just showing that as more of an illustration
[09:25:09] <WebDragon> see I knew it was something obvious
[09:25:13] <ajpiano> it doesn't mean it's the ideal pattern for all things
[09:25:19] <WebDragon> true enough
[09:26:12] <ajpiano> Doddlin: if you add the rest of the HTML and include jQuery in the fiddle instead of mootools
[09:26:19] <ajpiano> i can help you but otherwise i can't see what's wrong
[09:26:27] <WebDragon> ajpiano: as it was I had three separate click definitions http://pastebin.com/tc1XJCW5
[09:26:42] <Doddlin> ajpiano, will do!
[09:26:55] <ajpiano> Doddlin: and like i said, you should use parseInt( something, 10 )
[09:26:59] <ajpiano> so that it always uses base 10
[09:27:01] <sente> 12:25 < snail> this shit must be real
[09:27:06] <Doddlin> ajpiano, ok!
[09:27:13] <raj> i'm [unsucessfully] trying to have the 'link' put everything into a tab--> http://jsfiddle.net/8qqqL/
[09:27:39] <ajpiano> WebDragon: if you wanted to use something like the pattern i showed you
[09:28:03] <ajpiano> a) you'd have to make it so that there was one slidebar object, with method on it.. slidebar.next, slidebar.prev, slidebar.toggle
[09:28:15] <ajpiano> and then you could shove the appropriate action in a data-attr or something
[09:28:34] <ajpiano> and do like slidebar[ $(this).data("action") ]();
[09:29:34] <macmartine> I'm trying to set the selected value of a select, which seems to work, however the selected value isn't getting submitted with the form https://gist.github.com/2628791
[09:30:12] <jhan> hola
[09:30:23] <macmartine> That outputs '11' to the console, but when I submit the form, client_id=''
[09:30:41] <macmartine> Anyone know why?
[09:31:01] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano - fixed the sorting. However, that method requires you either rebind events, delegate up the chain, or do .live()
[09:31:15] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: Not a big deal though.
[09:31:16] <ajpiano> ah
[09:31:19] <johnkpaul> ?demo @macmartine
[09:31:26] <ajpiano> yea i mean using delegation seems like a reasonable choie anyway
[09:31:40] <johnkpaul> no more bot
[09:31:53] <macmartine> johnkpaul: ack, i had a hidden field of the same name. sometimes it just takes asking -- then i figure it out :)
[09:32:06] <johnkpaul> :)
[09:33:20] <WebDragon> ajpiano: aha, okay
[09:33:37] <WebDragon> that I can wrap my brain around
[09:34:39] <WebDragon> appreciate the clarification. I'm too much of a JOAT to specialize in the js as much as you guys do, so apologies if I seem a little dense at times :)
[09:34:52] <WebDragon> I get there eventually though
[09:34:57] <Doddlin> ajpiano, I got it working, almost, is there a .click function for checkboxes aswell like for a button? So I can fire an update on 'checked'?
[09:35:05] <ajpiano> Doddlin: use change
[09:35:13] <ajpiano> to respond to changes in a checkbox state
[09:35:40] <Doddlin> so $('#checkbox').change(function(){ //code }); ?
[09:35:56] <ajpiano> yep
[09:36:04] <Doddlin> thx! :D
[09:37:20] <shoky> raj: what're you trying to do there
[09:38:06] <raj> i'm trying to have `link` put the form into the first tab
[09:38:54] <shoky> the 'link' creates the tabs though
[09:39:30] <shoky> the form is already there
[09:39:36] <raj> yeah
[09:39:41] <raj> i want to place the form into the first tab
[09:39:48] <raj> the contents of the first tab
[09:40:49] <n00by> I want to make https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen/ to render it's dropdown in body
[09:41:09] <n00by> anyone uses chosen? (yeah, I'm guru-hunting =D)
[09:41:10] <shoky> raj but you're not following the tabs API
[09:41:12] <jrockjiggz> how do i replace text?
[09:42:05] <raj> hmm, thought I was
[09:42:40] <shoky> raj, look at the sample source on http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[09:42:56] <shoky> your tabs just has the <ul>
[09:43:16] <shoky> oh $('div').tabs() sorry
[09:44:22] <raj> that's what I'm following though
[09:44:41] <JillesCode> So guys, I'm working on a new chrome plugin, which is called iDontLike, basically, what it does, is when you activate it, everything you click hides, now my code for it is $(this).on('click',function(){ $(this).hide(); });, but I need to somehow get that code (and jQuery) in a webpage FROM a chrome extension, any clue how?
[09:44:44] <raj> and then I named href='#myform' so it'd show the form
[09:45:00] <shoky> raj well it works
[09:45:02] <shoky> no?
[09:45:22] <shoky> if you add the jqui css that is...
[09:45:34] <raj> omg, that's the second time iv'e done this, isn't it
[09:45:39] <raj> forgot the jquery-ui css
[09:45:43] <raj> thanks shoky
[09:45:44] <shoky> ;p
[09:46:12] <shoky> that's the first thing jsfiddle should change, imo
[09:46:26] <shoky> making the external resources more accessible/visible/etc
[09:46:54] <raj> NOOOO, first and foremost that freaking autoindenting
[09:47:06] <shoky> and fucken auto-include the jqui css
[09:47:18] <raj> word :)
[09:47:24] <raj> where the hell is caniuse
[09:47:27] <shoky> and let me save templates
[09:47:31] <shoky> dont wanna save bookmarks
[09:47:37] <raj> templates? which templates?
[09:47:41] <shoky> fiddle templates
[09:47:45] <WebDragon> shoky: like html template blanks for adding stuff ?
[09:47:47] <shoky> like.. a jqui template
[09:47:50] <shoky> no
[09:47:53] <shoky> fiddle templates
[09:48:05] <raj> like, to just save the code, that is?
[09:48:21] <WebDragon> well yeah I get that, but how do you mean differently from saving your fiddle and forking it
[09:48:24] <shoky> yes, but built-in to jsfiddle
[09:48:33] <raj> yeah, that'd be useful
[09:48:52] <shoky> when i save/fork a fiddle , the only way i can later access it is by bookmark or by that useless long list i get in my 'profile'
[09:48:54] <jrockjiggz> would anyone know why .text() is replacing html? simple example: http://jsfiddle.net/PSkGb/
[09:48:55] <WebDragon> just create a saved fiddle blank and fork it. boom instant template
[09:48:59] <raj> a zip of the css, js, html I guess
[09:49:13] <shoky> WebDragon yes and then i need to remember to bookmark it
[09:49:21] <WebDragon> shoky: or just log in
[09:49:26] <shoky> how does that help?
[09:49:30] <WebDragon> jsfiddle remembers your saved fiddles
[09:49:33] <WebDragon> :)
[09:49:40] <raj> right, but I think he wants to be able to download the js/css/html files
[09:49:42] <shoky> it remembers, but it doesnt give me easy access to them
[09:49:47] <shoky> just a long list of all my fiddles, yay.
[09:50:04] <raj> or a possibility to rename
[09:50:13] <shoky> you can rename in the 'info' tab
[09:50:18] <shoky> which is annoying too
[09:50:34] <WebDragon> it should be more easily renamable
[09:50:41] <WebDragon> as opposed to an extra step away
[09:51:01] <shoky> but more importantly it should let you have 'favorites' or 'templates' or something else built-in
[09:51:05] <WebDragon> arbitrary resorting of ones personal fiddles would be nice
[09:51:12] <WebDragon> favorites yes, good plan
[09:51:23] <WebDragon> shoky: have you suggested it in #jsfiddle?
[09:51:31] <WebDragon> he's open to ideas
[09:51:36] <shoky> nah i'm sure it wouldnt be new suggestions
[09:51:41] <someprimetime> what was the suggestion?
[09:51:43] <WebDragon> you never know
[09:51:49] <someprimetime> i would gladly pay for jsfiddle if it was always up
[09:51:56] <raj> WebDragon, I don't think suggestions in there go anywhere
[09:52:03] <someprimetime> also implementing command in place of control would be nice for us mac users
[09:52:07] <WebDragon> the above discussion makes it pretty clear how what you suggest is different from what it does and why it would be of benefit
[09:52:12] <johnkpaul> he response to tweets fairly often
[09:52:15] <johnkpaul> you could try asking on twitter
[09:52:33] <WebDragon> raj: he turned down my suggestion but he listened and gave salient feedback on why not. so .. it doesn't hurt to ask :)
[09:52:36] <shoky> i'm just assuming it's in development and that soon enough a new build wil lbe rolled out so we can see improvements
[09:52:49] <shoky> if it doesnt look to be going that way i'll make sure to suggest directly
[09:53:04] <WebDragon> the sooner its in the mix the easier it is to roll out
[09:53:08] <WebDragon> just sayin :)
[09:53:44] <shoky> i'll suggest a suggestion box then !
[09:53:51] <raj> haha, nice
[09:56:45] <WebDragon> shoky: heh
[09:57:25] <WebDragon> suggestion box with vote-ables
[09:57:48] <velcrobots> shoky: i have this 99% working, thanks to you.  my problem is, when passing the url parameter, clicking on another image won't override (because i guess the url parameter is still there?)
[09:57:51] <velcrobots> http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/hu3Pz/52/
[09:58:15] <raj> is there a jquery-ui-latest somewhere?
[09:58:17] <shoky> i see there's a fiddles templates ticket: https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha/issues/125
[09:58:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #125 on jsfiddle-docs-alpha (ThomasBurleson; 4m, 4w ago): Save fiddle as Template
[09:58:38] <shoky> raj i used: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[10:00:01] <tomoyuki28jp> I wanna detect swipe event for smartphones. Is there any good plugin?
[10:00:46] <johnkpaul> tomoyuki28jp: http://mwbrooks.github.com/thumbs.js/
[10:01:39] <velcrobots> shoky: never mind, i'm sorry, it seems to be working.  what i screwed up was adding a return false onto the click - i don't want the page to jump up.  how do i do this?
[10:02:01] <tomoyuki28jp> johnkpaul: Does it support swipe event?
[10:02:11] <tomoyuki28jp> I mean swipe left or right.
[10:02:20] <shoky> velcrobots: donno what you mean by page jumping up
[10:02:37] <jonathancutrell> tommyvyo: zepto is also good for mobile, and is jquery-esque
[10:02:40] <Ankabout> how do I search through a group of elements to find one that has title="my title here"
[10:03:04] <shoky> Ankabout you want either .filter or .find  depending on what you mean exactly
[10:03:10] <tommyvyo> jonathancutrell i think you were talking to tomoyuki28jp
[10:03:17] <jonathancutrell> tommyvyo: indeed.
[10:03:19] <tomoyuki28jp> jonathancutrell: thanks
[10:03:38] <velcrobots> shoky: go here: http://www.bjtonline.com/lists?list=planes and the right image/list will be showing.  scroll down a bit, then click on the other image.  the page will jump.  we used to put a return fasle on the onclick behavior to prevent this, thing is i dunno where in the script that would have to go to not break things
[10:03:41] <tomoyuki28jp> tommyvyo: howdy :)
[10:04:11] <johnkpaul> tomoyuki28jp: I thought that it did, I might be wrong
[10:04:41] <Ankabout> shoky, so I can do find.(".my-div a").attr(MyTitle) ??
[10:05:51] <shoky> velcrobots i think you want event.preventDefault()  : http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hu3Pz/54/
[10:06:08] <Ankabout> shoky, wait of course that's wrong...
[10:07:10] <shoky> Ankabout: $('.my-div a').filter('[title="my title"]')
[10:07:14] <shoky> for example
[10:07:30] <Ankabout> hmmm that could work
[10:07:59] <velcrobots> shoky: yes, that did it - i actually tried adding that one line, but what i failed to do was add the "event" inside the function
[10:07:59] <Ankabout> and then if title is a variable it would be  $('.my-div a').filter('[title=' + mytitle + ']') ??
[10:08:05] <velcrobots> i'll get this eventually
[10:09:06] <someprimetime> what's the difference between filter('[title="foo"]') and (attr('title') === 'foo') ?
[10:09:08] <jonathancutrell> Hey ajpiano - how can I retain the data-attr stuff on LI's when I'm doing html() replacing after sorting?
[10:09:13] <shoky> velcrobots it should usually work even without adding the event as function argumnt
[10:09:25] <someprimetime> jonathancutrell: store them into an object?
[10:09:28] <shoky> someprimetime: they are totally different things
[10:09:33] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: where would they have gone?
[10:09:39] <someprimetime> shoky: so why would i use one over the other?
[10:09:42] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: .data doesn't *remove* the data attrs from your elements
[10:10:17] <JillesCode> Guys
[10:10:19] <ajpiano> someprimetime: one gives you a collection of all the elements who have that title
[10:10:27] <shoky> someprimetime you'd use filter  when you have a jquery collection you want to filter, and you'd use  attr('title')=='foo'  when you have a jq obj whose title you wanna compare to 'foo'
[10:10:37] <JillesCode> I found out how to do everything I need, but now I need to scroll to each div with a class of block
[10:10:40] <ajpiano> the other is a truth test that simply yields if a particular element's title is foo
[10:10:50] <someprimetime> oh cool thanks guys
[10:11:02] <JillesCode>  function scrollme(){ 	blockk = $('.block'); 	$.scrollTo(blockk, 1000); }  $(document).ready(function(){ 	setTimeout(scrollme(),1000); }); doesn't work, any idea's?
[10:11:06] <shoky> someprimetime: take another look at your question and understand why it makes no sense
[10:11:22] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: Ah - wait a moment. The data isn't actually defined in the markup. So I guess it goes away when the html is replaced.
[10:11:30] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: Trying to basically set up an initial order on li items
[10:11:35] <ajpiano> mm
[10:11:43] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: maybe you do want to stick with detach :p
[10:12:01] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: ha - or perhaps I can define the initial order in the markup.
[10:12:11] <shoky> JillesCode: what is $.scrollTo ?
[10:12:18] <ajpiano> it's a plugin, shoky
[10:12:22] <shoky> oh
[10:12:25] <JillesCode> shoky: a plugin
[10:12:28] <ajpiano> jonathancutrell: yeah, it would be good to have them inserted in order to begin iwth
[10:12:30] <someprimetime> shoky: yeah guess it doesn't make sense no actually
[10:12:33] <someprimetime> now*
[10:12:37] <shoky> good ;)
[10:12:38] <JillesCode> I just need to scroll to each div, every 5 seconds
[10:13:55] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: Ah, ended up being fine just adding in a detach() before the sort.
[10:14:04] <jonathancutrell> ajpiano: li = $list.children("li").detach().sort(function(a,b){
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> aye
[10:14:19] <jonathancutrell> and later, $list.html(li);
[10:14:22] <angrywombat> how would i access a data structure outside of an $.ajax({..etc..}); call? i'm talking about scope here
[10:14:52] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: do it with promises, probably.
[10:15:13] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: unless you are defining a function to work inside your callback, outside of your function.
[10:15:19] <shoky> JillesCode: i think you meant:  blockk.scrollTo(1000)   no?
[10:15:31] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: then you can just define an argument, like doSomething(data){}
[10:15:34] <shoky> ah no sorry
[10:15:45] <JillesCode> Nope, shoky, I got it working already, but I just can't do it for the other divs
[10:15:51] <JillesCode> it scrolls to the first div, but then stops
[10:16:07] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: and then when you do your ajax callback, just use the doSomething function, which will already have the data passed to it.
[10:16:21] <angrywombat> jonathancutrell: i'm not sure if i'm following you (hella jquery/js newb) - the code in question is http://pastebin.com/WTKUn75U
[10:16:39] <Ankabout> shoky, would that find the <a> with title=title, or will it find children of <a> with that title?
[10:16:47] <angrywombat> basically i'm defining data outside of ajax call and want to include it in the data portion for the post
[10:17:32] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: ah okay.
[10:17:45] <shoky> Ankabout: would what
[10:17:54] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: so just define a variable outside of the function, like var obj = {someProp : "someValue"}
[10:18:11] <Ankabout> $('.my-div a').filter('[title="my title"]')
[10:18:25] <angrywombat> jonathancutrell: that's what i was thinking but it seems messy.. am i going about this whole thing wrong?
[10:18:31] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: then when you do your ajax call, you can do something like $.post("post.php", obj)
[10:18:36] <Ankabout> or will it return all elements that are .my-div a with title my title
[10:18:37] <shoky> ankabout: it would find all <a>'s with that title
[10:18:42] <Ankabout> ah ok, thanks
[10:18:54] <shoky> all <a>'s that are descendants of .my-div elements, that is
[10:19:40] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: Well, messy isn't really entirely descriptive. That's a pretty common approach; define your arguments to be passed as an object of key/value pairs, and then run the call.
[10:20:11] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: then attach callbacks if you need them, like so: $.post("post.php", obj).success(function(){ /*do something here */ });
[10:20:17] <angrywombat> jonathancutrell: ok, thanks for the info
[10:20:21] <jonathancutrell> angrywombat: anytime
[10:20:39] <Ankabout> shoky, ok that makes sense. then I think I have a syntax issue
[10:21:04] <Ankabout> my title is stored in a variable, and it's not reading the variable correctly. what's the syntax if my title is stored in MyTitle ?
[10:21:21] <shoky> hmm?
[10:21:51] <shoky> '[title="' + MyTitle + '"]'
[10:23:22] <Bill-barriere> can on shove a <scipt> tag anywhere in a page or just in the <head>
[10:23:29] <Ankabout> hmmm. unexpected end of input
[10:23:39] <shoky> Ankabout: or just:  $(...).filter( function() { return this.title == MyTitle } )
[10:23:55] <shoky> hmm or this.getAttribute('title')
[10:24:21] <shoky> Bill-barriere: anywhere. but it may behave differently in different places
[10:25:40] <Ankabout> shoky, hmm that can read the title, but I'm doing a test. My title is dynamic, and the selector has to select the <a> with that title
[10:26:05] <shoky> yah
[10:26:25] <Bill-barriere> shoky, so say i have that http://pastebin.ca/2145342 in the middle of my body somewhere it should work or not? when then running through venkel i cant see request.js or jquery being loaded
[10:27:10] <shoky> venkel?

[10:29:31] <christo_m> has anyone tried styling the events for fullcalendar?
[10:29:32] <christo_m> im just trying to make events of a certain class take up full width, and nothing like width:100% !important or anything will do that.

[10:36:46] <TheEternalAbyss> greetings. quick question: in jQuerUI, if the checkbox states for nchecked and hcecked are ui-checkbox, and ui-checkbox-checked. is the greyed out state ui-checkbox-disabled?
[10:36:47] <shoky> raj did you enjoy last night's GoT ?
[10:37:02] <raj> I haven't watched it yet!

[10:37:20] <shoky> hehhh
[10:37:28] <raj> (cuz I usually record on dvr)
[10:37:58] <ryanneufeld> hlveheart: have you looked at location ?
[10:38:07] <shoky> hlveheart: if (location.href == 'www.hlveheart.com') $(element).addClass('someclass')
[10:38:16] <ryanneufeld> hlveheart: open a console and try document.location
[10:38:26] <ryanneufeld> and explore the various things you have access to
[10:38:30] <hlveheart> i wonder, can you do it more specifically to look at just the page name?
[10:38:33] <ryanneufeld> ?mdn document.location
[10:38:34] <hlveheart> stupid question, I guess
[10:38:39] <ryanneufeld> nope, it's not
[10:38:45] <ryanneufeld> it's the right question

[10:39:59] <ahandy> hey guys. question, i'm using scrollTop() and it's working fine on a PC. However, it isn't on an iPhone. How can I fix it?
[10:40:07] <hlveheart> ^^ thanks
[10:40:48] <hlveheart> i wonder if i'd be better off having it check for elements on the page
[10:41:07] <TheEternalAbyss> nobody knows?
[10:41:09] <hlveheart> as it's going to be for 5 pages.
[10:41:10] <hlveheart> Hmph
[10:41:14] <ryanneufeld> hlveheart: why can't you just do it on the generation side of it
[10:41:18] <ryanneufeld> so do it server side
[10:41:30] <hlveheart> basically, here's what I'm trying to do
[10:41:39] <hlveheart> I have a sidebar that I have being generated in an inc file
[10:41:54] <hlveheart> I want to add a 'onpage' class to the link in the sidebar if you're on that page
[10:42:08] <hlveheart> which if I wanted to do serverside, I'd have to not use the include file
[10:42:15] <ryanneufeld> hlveheart: why not?
[10:42:26] <ryanneufeld> hlveheart: what language you using server side?
[10:42:29] <hlveheart> ASP
[10:42:33] <ryanneufeld> oh, sorry to hear that
[10:42:36] <hlveheart> lol
[10:42:40] <hlveheart> Not my choice, sir. :P
[10:42:49] <danzik17> there is a .NET at the end of that ASP....right?
[10:42:50] <ryanneufeld> it's always a choice
[10:43:08] <hlveheart> danzik17
[10:43:09] <hlveheart> yes.
[10:43:12] <danzik17> oh, thank god.
[10:43:28] <ryanneufeld> oh, well, that's better, but still I feel bad for you
[10:43:29] <hlveheart> ryanneufeld, i'm just the web dev here, if it were up to me I'd be coding in PHP
[10:43:40] <hlveheart> The boss says he wants this, I go with this
[10:43:41] <hlveheart> lol
[10:43:43] <ryanneufeld> hlveheart: it is up to you, get a job coding in PHP :P

[10:44:34] * hlveheart shrieks
[10:45:13] <TheEternalAbyss> well I'm surprised
[10:46:00] <shoky> TheEternalAbyss
[10:46:09] <Lobosque> is there a way to make show/hide use visibility instead display?
[10:46:14] <TheEternalAbyss> shoky: yes?
[10:46:33] <shoky> TheEternalAbyss: it's ui-state-disabled
[10:47:04] <shoky> though that's not the state, it's just the class name
[10:47:46] <TheEternalAbyss> ok, so i'm curious then how come the checked and unchecked class names are ui-checkbox and ui-checkbox-checked?
[10:48:04] <TheEternalAbyss> yes class names
[10:48:12] <TheEternalAbyss> that's what I need
[10:48:20] <shoky> why wouldn't they be?
[10:48:33] <TheEternalAbyss> well if disabled is ui-state-disabled
[10:48:40] <shoky> yes?
[10:48:59] <TheEternalAbyss> it would make sense that all three are either ui-checkbox, ui-checkbox-checked and ui-checkbox-disabled
[10:49:05] <shoky> why?
[10:49:12] <TheEternalAbyss> or all three be ui-state, ui-state etc etc
[10:49:17] <shoky> disabled is not specific to checkboxes
[10:49:19] <TheEternalAbyss> cause it's more logical
[10:49:24] <shoky> not really
[10:50:02] <shoky> what? ui-state-checkbox? what are you talking about?
[10:50:03] <TheEternalAbyss> seems to me if there is an enabled and disabled state, migh tas well either call it enabled, disabled state, or name it by component
[10:50:24] <shoky> it IS called disabled
[10:50:32] <TheEternalAbyss> either ui-state-enabled or ui-checkbox-checked
[10:50:42] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm not sure if my point is getting across lol
[10:50:45] <shoky> what does checked have to do with disabled?
[10:50:47] <shoky> you're not
[10:50:52] <shoky> its not
[10:50:55] <TheEternalAbyss> ok
[10:51:04] <shoky> a button can be disabled too
[10:51:08] <TheEternalAbyss> i have a ui-checkbox right?
[10:51:22] <youngin_> Eviltwin: talk to me man
[10:51:24] <TheEternalAbyss> yes but I have a class from jquery called ui-checkbox
[10:51:33] <shoky> yah
[10:51:40] <TheEternalAbyss> and when it's checked i have a class called ui-checkbox-checked
[10:51:43] <youngin_> Eviltwin: are you up for hire like you said you were or are you just playing me for a fool
[10:51:56] <youngin_> Eviltwin: come on after 100+ messages you can at least reply to me man
[10:51:58] <TheEternalAbyss> makes logical sense to me if the disabled state would be called ui-checkbox-disabled
[10:51:59] <shoky> because ui-checkbox-checked is speficic to checkboxes.
[10:52:06] <shoky> while disabled, is NOT
[10:52:29] <TheEternalAbyss> yes, but that makes no sense nomenclature-wise
[10:52:38] <shoky> it does to most people
[10:52:46] <TheEternalAbyss> why even bother with something specific if then you are going to apply something generic to it
[10:52:53] <shoky> huh?
[10:53:06] <shoky> why can't an element have both a generic class and a more specific one?
[10:53:13] <TheEternalAbyss> i mean why use a specific class name for one state and a general one to another
[10:53:23] <shoky> because one is specific and one is not , WTF
[10:53:24] <Bill-barriere> fuck me, just a ' instead of a " somewhere and the whole damnned thing was broken
[10:53:28] <Bill-barriere> i hate javascript
[10:53:31] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm not saying it can't, just seems counter intuitive
[10:53:50] <tw2113> it loves you Bill-barriere
[10:54:20] <Bill-barriere> men this client is damn lucky i am integrating our apps in his web site i usually dick slap them for just mentionning web development
[10:54:24] <TheEternalAbyss> shoky: ok this is my problem: if I have a disabled checkbox, it will hhave a different style then a disabled button
[10:54:25] <shoky> TheEternalAbyss it wouldn't make sense to put a ui-checkbox-checked class on a text input, right?
[10:54:34] <TheEternalAbyss> REGARDLESS if the disabled state applies to both
[10:54:41] <Bill-barriere> ok it work, ship it! /me run away
[10:54:52] <shoky> that's not true
[10:55:03] <shoky> the checkbox will also have ui-state-disabled , if it is disabled
[10:55:08] <Jon47> Bill-barriere: if you don't know the difference between ' and " it will probably bone you in just about any language
[10:55:16] <TheEternalAbyss> shoky, yes it is. I have a sprite with a specific x, y coordinate for a disabled checkbox
[10:55:34] <TheEternalAbyss> i can't use that x,y coordinate on my sprite for a button that is disabled
[10:55:38] <Bill-barriere> Jon47, other language are strongly typed and got real debugger with them
[10:55:47] <shoky> TheEternalAbyss: no idea what you're talking about
[10:55:58] <ryanneufeld> TheEternalAbyss: You can override the CSS for any of the jquery-ui stuff
[10:56:17] <Jon47> use chrome, it's got an amazing debugger
[10:56:18] <Bill-barriere> thats the kind of error that any compiller worth a damn would spot in 3 second
[10:56:48] <TheEternalAbyss> if I just use ui-state-disabled for my disabled component (regardless if it's a button or checkbox) I can't use my sprite
[10:56:49] <ryanneufeld> Bill-barriere: that's the kind of error a shitty programmer blames on a language
[10:57:33] <Bill-barriere> ryanneufeld, because javascript is not a shitty language? gzzz doing php/javascript since last week i feel like i would have a better time with cobol...
[10:57:49] <Bill-barriere> damn i hate web development, i usually hire monkey to do that for me :/
[10:58:01] <TheEternalAbyss> Bill-barriere: o.O
[10:58:02] <shoky> web development is not javascript
[10:58:15] <ryanneufeld> Bill-barriere: Then do that, this is not the place to bitch about your shortcomings/lack of knowledge or experience
[10:58:16] <shoky> nor vice versa
[10:58:19] <Jon47> i guess i'm proud to be a monkey, but i'm glad i'm not working for you
[10:58:24] <shoky> amen to that
[10:58:27] * tw2113 eats a banana
[10:58:30] <shoky> ;D
[10:58:39] <TheEternalAbyss> i agree with shoky
[10:58:42] <ryanneufeld> Bill-barriere: this is a place to ask for help, complaining here won't gain you any sympathy
[10:58:44] <TheEternalAbyss> amen to that indeed
[10:58:52] <ajpiano> not to mention ' and " are the same in javascript
[10:58:55] <ajpiano> they don't behave any differently
[10:59:02] * Bill-barriere sip his coffee and watch the chaos ensuring

[10:59:14] <TheEternalAbyss> shoky: thanks for bearing with me. I was just trying to understand that logic. I'll use whatever needs to be used :)
[10:59:33] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: oh right, and if they're mismatched, then you blame the language and insult the people who use it
[10:59:34] <ajpiano> right-o
[10:59:41] <TheEternalAbyss> oh so Bill-barriere is trolling i see
[10:59:47] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: you have a wooden leg!!!! you're a pirate!

[11:02:08] <jrockjiggz> hi, would anyone be able to help me figure out how :first-child isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/Uc3wu/
[11:02:51] <shoky> jrockjiggz: it's a first child of its parent
[11:03:08] <shoky> so :first-child is working correctly
[11:03:10] <tw2113> the inner fieldset
[11:03:16] <ryanneufeld> jrockjiggz: you're applying it to the first-child of the legend elements
[11:03:35] <warrenparsons> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/Uc3wu/1/
[11:04:39] <jrockjiggz> hmm, i thought first-child of original selector .optionalDiv
[11:05:08] <tw2113> you're not that specific
[11:05:41] <jrockjiggz> ok thanks, i'll use > to declare direct child
[11:05:57] <tw2113> i got it to work with $('.optionalDiv > fieldset > legend:first-child').css({ color: 'red' });
[11:06:05] <tw2113> but i'm sure that's taxing as hell
[11:06:48] <jrockjiggz> thanks
[11:11:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's a pretty bad selector honestly. Is there any way you can add a class to the legend element?
[11:12:32] <Whirl3d> tw2113, are you codemonkey from Ultrashock?
[11:12:39] <tw2113> nope
[11:12:44] <Whirl3d> pfew
[11:14:21] <jrockjiggz> ryanneufeld: probably should, is it that bad?
[11:16:00] <ryanneufeld> well, it's not great, it'll work, but that selector will have to go through some regexp to get parsed. Regexp is slower than classes or ids which, if I'm not mistaken, use native browser methods where available.
[11:17:18] <mmissions> Can anyone explain this from the jQuery src to me? var set = jQuery.clean( arguments ); set.push.apply( set, this.toArray() ); return this.pushStack( set, "before", arguments );
[11:37:39] <jonathancutrell> timmywil: G'day sir
[11:37:54] <timmywil> jonathancutrell: well hello
[11:39:18] <jonathancutrell> timmywil: How goes it?
[11:39:51] <timmywil> jonathancutrell: busy times getting this app out, how bout you?
[11:39:55] <shoky> mmissions: that's for taking care of  the .before( function )  usage
[11:40:11] <jonathancutrell> timmwil - I hear that. Fighting with TopSpin Media stuff currently.
[11:41:41] <timmywil> jonathancutrell: I'm working with some of the old crew. :)

[11:46:21] <christo_m> anyone ever run into the issue of datepicker not selecting dates properly
[11:46:45] <christo_m> some dude on stackoverflow had multiple ID conflict, but im using a class of .datepicker, so dont think that should arise
[11:51:50] <thirdender> christo_m: jQuery UI datepicker? do you have a sample page?
[11:56:53] <raj> shoky, why is .tabs() calling the send method!!? http://68.46.138.78:8080/testsingleupload
[11:58:27] <christo_m> thirdender: unfortunately no
[11:58:37] <christo_m> thirdender: NDA stuff i probably cant show you
[11:58:44] <christo_m> thirdender: and i know if i jsfiddle it itll work in there ahha
[11:58:51] <thirdender> lol :-p
[11:59:06] <christo_m> and yes jquery ui datepicker
[11:59:24] <christo_m> the thing is sometimes i can pick a date, and itll format it properly as yy-mm-dd
[11:59:29] <christo_m> other times it wont populate the textbox
[11:59:37] <christo_m> no errors in console
[11:59:58] <christo_m> thirdender: you ever have this issue?
[12:00:03] <termite> are you using firefox
[12:00:06] <christo_m> yeup
[12:00:10] <tw2113> hi garann
[12:00:38] <termite> try in chrome I notice that sometimes firebug can go nuts on you
[12:00:47] <termite> and you have to restart ff
[12:00:50] <thirdender> no... I was actually using some other date pickers recently, so I might not be the best help
[12:01:27] <garann> hey tw2113
[12:01:44] <shoky> raj: it's not calling send, it's trying to load a tab via ajax
[12:02:19] <raj> so why's it trying to hit .info-entry-form?
[12:02:34] <christo_m> termite: chromes console doesnt offer any insight
[12:02:38] <raj> the top of the stack says jQuery.ajaxTransport.send
[12:02:41] <tw2113> garann saw you mention IRC on twitter, realized you were probably hanging out in here :P
[12:02:49] <raj> that's why I thought it was calling our send method
[12:03:29] <shoky> raj and 2 lines below that in the stack is: d.widget.load
[12:03:46] <shoky> which is how i knew it was trying to load ;p
[12:03:48] <termite> christo_m, which I could see the page
[12:03:50] <garann> tw2113: in here with all the cool kids? naturally. :)
[12:04:09] <tw2113> i thought you defined it. var coolkids = garann;
[12:04:11] <raj> hmm k

[12:05:52] <thirdender> christo_m: can you post the JS that initializes the date pickers to http://pastebin.com/? just the lines that initialize the date picker... curious, since it should work fine
[12:05:54] <shoky> raj: the tabs href needs to point to an id , not a class
[12:06:11] <christo_m> sure
[12:06:12] <christo_m> sec
[12:06:26] <raj> k
[12:06:31] <raj> shoky, would that fix this?
[12:06:41] <christo_m> thirdender: http://pastebin.com/5it5zwCU
[12:06:43] <shoky> dunno, it'd be a step towards it anyway ;p
[12:06:56] <raj> k, doing so
[12:07:47] <shoky> raj also, the examples on jqui have <div>s as tabs
[12:07:57] <shoky> not <form> and not <button>
[12:08:16] <raj> the button is just within the form though
[12:08:51] <shoky> </form><button id='submit-info-button'>Submit</button>
[12:08:58] <raj> oh, woops
[12:09:15] <raj> but I didn't tabulize that
[12:09:20] <raj> just the form
[12:09:22] <christo_m> thirdender: im binding to a class, so i dont think thered be conflicts
[12:09:25] <shoky> i guess thats ok
[12:09:36] <christo_m> in cake, i just give the input 'class'=>'datepicker'
[12:09:37] <thirdender> christo_m: yeah, it really should be working fine...
[12:09:38] <shoky> but personally i wouldnt risk it to begin with
[12:09:48] <christo_m> its in a dialog window
[12:09:52] <christo_m> dunno if that matters
[12:09:57] <shoky> adding a wrapping div hurts noone
[12:09:58] <christo_m> ajax loaded, one form works, the other doesnt
[12:10:30] <christo_m> actually, when i submit on the one that works, then try to open again and select a date
[12:10:31] <raj> k, correcting said issues :)
[12:10:33] <christo_m> it fails
[12:10:35] <shoky> ;>
[12:12:15] <termite> christo_m, yeah I tried it in fiddle and it works http://jsfiddle.net/rich_h/PvP5g/
[12:12:54] <christo_m> termite: ya i figured it would
[12:12:59] <shoky> raj: btw re <raj> but I didn't tabulize that
[12:13:02] <christo_m> the codebase im dealing with is way more complicated, meaning any number of things could be happening
[12:13:15] <shoky> raj: you didnt tabulize anything, you just called .tabs() on the containing div
[12:13:36] <raj> semantics, shemantics
[12:13:44] <shoky> jquery ui did the rest, and its expecting tabs, not buttons
[12:13:50] <shoky> is what i mean by that
[12:14:04] <termite> christo_m, is it possible you have a transparent div or something blocking it?
[12:14:28] <Whirl3d> if someone has just a second for an easy off topic question: I can't get my wrapping li elements to hide...do I have to do it in jQuery or is there a css-trick that I need to use. I have asked CSS, and they helped me get this far: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hcPHx/14/
[12:14:32] <christo_m> termite: maybe..
[12:14:41] <christo_m> termite: oh no that isnt the case
[12:14:51] <christo_m> termite: the box comes up, selecting a date doesnt populate the texbox tho
[12:15:27] <termite> christo_m, yeah but is there something with a higher z-index sitting on top of it
[12:15:42] <shoky> Whirl3d: first of all you're missing a closing curly }  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hcPHx/15/
[12:15:45] <termite> does the box go away
[12:15:53] <termite> picker I mean
[12:15:58] <christo_m> termite: no. the picker is there in full view
[12:15:59] <christo_m> i click a day
[12:16:03] <christo_m> but it doesnt give me a value
[12:16:06] <christo_m> and the box disappears when i click
[12:16:17] <christo_m> it behaves properly, it just isnt giving me the value in the textbox
[12:16:25] <shoky> Whirl3d: and second, what do you mean?
[12:16:49] <Whirl3d> yeah. I have tried so many different things, I guess it just dropped off. Still the problem remains. Thanks for looking. If you resize the screen, the li elements drop down a line when I want them to go away
[12:17:41] <termite> christo_m,  hmm only guess I have is that something is handling the click and returning a false or event.prevent_default(). But that is just a guess
[12:17:57] <thirdender> christo_m: http://jsfiddle.net/zSNzF/ :-p want to add the dialog logic? that could be part of the problem if it's binding the handlers at the wrong times
[12:18:05] <christo_m> sure
[12:19:20] <christo_m> thirdender: well all i do is load my view with the form into a div
[12:19:22] <christo_m> then dialog it.
[12:19:26] <christo_m> the datepicker is something within that view.
[12:19:31] <christo_m> so i dont think that would be the case
[12:19:51] <shoky> Whirl3d:  white-space: nowrap;
[12:20:16] <Whirl3d> huh? I have never heard of such a thing.
[12:20:35] <johnkpaul> ?g css white-space @ Whirl3d
[12:20:35] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hcPHx/16/
[12:20:36] <bot-t> Whirl3d, CSS white-space property - http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_white-space.asp
[12:20:59] <johnkpaul> I always forget that ther's no bot filter for w3schools, brianloveswords, it got me again
[12:21:03] <shoky> (i added the overflow:hidden to the ul just for testing)
[12:21:57] <Whirl3d> shoky, we are close: see how the elements aren't dropping off as elements (causing the bar to resize). Instead, it's cutting the elements off.
[12:22:05] <shoky> yea
[12:22:21] <shoky> cause they're not getting wrapped anymore
[12:22:34] <shoky> just hidden
[12:23:00] <Whirl3d> Then I am using the wrong language. I need them to disappear, rather than get cut off.
[12:23:15] <shoky> lemme see if i can find a css way to do it
[12:23:16] <raj> shoky, switching it to an id fixed it all
[12:23:24] <shoky> raj sweet ;>
[12:23:26] <raj> can you explain that?
[12:23:31] <jeebster> hey there. any ideas how to dynamically resize an element as  the window changes?
[12:23:39] <shoky> raj yes: jqui expects ids
[12:23:49] <jquery_issue> Hi all, Rails and Jquery question:  I have a subfolder within assets/javascripts where I include some jquery min files.  I also use the jquery-rails gem which includes jquery.  For some reason, my subfolder cannot see those jquery files unless they're in the subfolder.  Any ideas?
[12:23:49] <raj> but why was it doing a $.get?
[12:24:57] <shoky> raj: cause when you dont give it an id, it assumes you've given it a url
[12:25:11] <raj> oh, very interesting
[12:25:19] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#ajax
[12:25:22] <raj> f'ing genious bro
[12:25:23] <raj> thank you
[12:25:27] <shoky> LoL np
[12:25:37] <shoky> stop coding and go watch GoT
[12:25:46] <shoky> better ep
[12:26:24] <raj> still not on a On Demand
[12:26:46] <raj> and HBO Go overheats my computer since I do my development in vbox :)
[12:26:54] <raj> oops, no, that's sad :(
[12:27:27] <shoky> then screw them and pirate it
[12:28:00] <raj> have you seen it on hbogo btw?
[12:28:58] <Whirl3d> here is the effect that I am looking for with the jquery solution. Which I am fine with atm, but seems like a lot for a little.http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/hcPHx/21/
[12:29:07] <shoky> Whirl3d: this sorta works: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hcPHx/22/
[12:29:10] <shoky> css only
[12:30:37] <shoky> oh
[12:31:50] <shoky> Whirl3d there: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hcPHx/25/
[12:31:53] <Whirl3d> shoky! That works great.
[12:32:37] <shoky> ;)
[12:32:37] <Whirl3d> margin:0? that's it?
[12:32:42] <biberao> hi
[12:32:49] <shoky> margin:0 just fixed the remaining issue
[12:32:53] <Whirl3d> oh, Margin bottom
[12:33:07] <Whirl3d> Brilliant brilliant. You are a saint. Thanks.
[12:33:24] <shoky> the magic was setting it back to wrap, increasing the height and giving negative margin-bottom
[12:33:49] <shoky> so that the li's that are wrapped are wrapped to the 'next line' which is offscreen
[12:33:54] <biberao> Whirl3d: whats the best way if you want to use jquery and other javascript in the same document?
[12:33:56] <shoky> needed to use line-height too
[12:33:59] <Whirl3d> I honestly would have never thought of that. Ever. Just amazing. #CSS couldn't figure it out either. LOL
[12:34:20] <Whirl3d> ?noconflict @ biberao
[12:34:20] <bot-t> biberao, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[12:34:22] <shoky> :) i think i saw a similar trick somewhere, i guess it stuck
[12:35:53] <biberao> ok thx
[12:36:04] <zoned> i'm trying to create a loading gif of some sort when firing an ajax request off and waiting for it. so far, nothing seems to work... even something as simple as $("body").css("background-color","black"); console.log("begin"); $.ajax({async:false,...}); $("body").css("background-color","white"); console.log("done"); ... i see a delay in the console log, but the background never flashes
[12:37:28] <shoky> raj i saw it through torrents
[12:37:39] <zoned> at first i was using jquery.loadmask plugin, same result, so then i tried simply setting the background of the body, and that doesn't work either. what am i missing?
[12:37:39] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, thanks for the link (albeit w3cfools) I'll check it out now.
[12:38:44] <zoned> i've also tried putting the mask/unmask code in the beforeSend and complete callbacks for $.ajax, still the same result (and the async: false should take care of it anyway, right?)
[12:39:06] <shoky> zoned don't use async: false
[12:39:24] <zoned> shoky, as i said, neither way works.
[12:39:52] <shoky> you need to put the css change in the ajax callback
[12:40:16] <shoky> that should work fine..
[12:41:00] <raj> shoky, it's awesome. it has this info window on the side that reminds you of what shit means during conversations
[12:41:02] <monk12> hello all, i need some help with a lil' jquery effect. I have a hidden text in a div... and when user hovers over the 'Edit' box, i want the inner text to gradually expand the Edit container left and downward: Right now its sporadic, not sure how to clean up: http://jsfiddle.net/FMJFr/7/
[12:41:19] <shoky> raj that sounds highly annoying :)
[12:41:39] <raj> nono, it's not
[12:41:41] <monk12> (the Edit' container can't have  pre-determined size to animate to, since the Edit is dynamic and can be in multiple languages)
[12:41:48] <raj> makes the show much better
[12:41:52] <raj> you can hide it if you want
[12:42:05] <raj> hmm, when .tabs('destroy') is called, it leaves an empty class attribute on the ul element
[12:42:06] <shoky> mm i understand stuf pretty good
[12:42:12] <raj> alright 1up
[12:42:30] <shoky> you mean it removes a class you had on it before?
[12:43:11] <raj> from http://jsfiddle.net/8qqqL/5/ , if you didn't call find('ul').remove()
[12:43:22] <raj> cuz I did .find($tabs).remove() instead
[12:43:46] <raj> but that doesn't work because of a stupid empty class left on the elements created by $tabs after .tabs('destroy')
[12:43:59] <shoky> umm why wouldn't the class attribute be empty?
[12:44:10] <raj> it should be
[12:44:17] <raj> but if it's empty, shouldn't it be gone?
[12:44:45] <shoky> hmm not sure i undeertand the issue
[12:44:49] <raj> not just have a silly `<ul class><li class><li class></ul>` thing
[12:45:04] <raj> like, it's just sitting there with `class` in there for no reason
[12:45:12] <shoky> there?
[12:45:25] <raj> in the tag
[12:45:26] <shoky> in firebug DOM viewer?
[12:45:29] <raj> <ul class>
[12:45:36] <raj> class is empty there, so it's pointless
[12:45:43] <raj> I'm using chrome, but yes
[12:45:48] <shoky> that's just a representation of the DOM
[12:45:58] <shoky> presented as html
[12:46:09] <raj> it's k, i'll just add an id to the tabs
[12:46:22] <shoky> didnt understand why its a problem if there's a class tag
[12:47:00] <raj> cuz then $tabs can't be used to find it again
[12:47:12] <raj> .find($tabs) doesn't work since it's not exactly what I created
[12:47:18] <shoky> when was $tabs used to find anything?
[12:47:33] <raj> it was used to prepend($tabs)
[12:47:38] <shoky> yes
[12:47:38] <monk12> P.S. got closer... http://jsfiddle.net/FMJFr/9/ Using UI slide looks a bit better, but still the main 'Edit' container opens to the width of the subtext, i want both to be animated at same time i guess. will look into it.
[12:47:43] <raj> so when I wanted to remove it, i couldn't
[12:47:49] <shoky> why
[12:48:17] <raj> cuz .tabs() had changed it, even after tabs.('destroy'), simply by leaving an empty class attribute on the ul/li items
[12:48:29] <shoky> you mean you couldn't do  $tabs.remove()  ?
[12:48:47] <raj> yep, .find($tabs).remove()
[12:49:22] <shoky> .find($tabs) wouldnt be useful anyway i think
[12:49:33] <raj> why not?
[12:49:40] <shoky> $tabs points to a specific <ul>
[12:49:47] <shoky> what does it mean to .find it?
[12:49:56] <raj> ok, so .find is superfluous
[12:50:01] <raj> but anyway, it wouldn't work
[12:50:23] <shoky> its not because of the class tho
[12:50:44] <raj> really?
[12:51:43] <shoky> it's cause when you call .tabs() funky stuff happens , maybe the original <ul>  gets destroyed
[12:51:59] <shoky> when you destroy it then it puts back the original <ul>
[12:52:14] <shoky> so its a new <ul> , not the one $tabs is pointing to i guess
[12:52:25] <shoky> hence .find('ul').remove()
[12:53:05] <raj> ah, ok, didn't realize it worked like that
[12:53:24] <shoky> i'm not sure it does, but that'd be one explanation
[12:54:19] <raj> :)
[12:54:21] <shoky> but lots of plugins that you call like .tabs() on your elements may change your DOM completely, so any references you had are nil
[12:54:24] <zoned> ok, so without using async false, what's the proper way to accomplish this?       // bunch of code..    if (condition) { $.ajax(....); }    // bunch more code that needs that ajax to have finished if condition was true
[12:54:54] <ryanneufeld> zoned: write functions to do the things
[12:55:17] <ryanneufeld> zoned: then use those as the callbacks in your ajax calls
[12:55:29] <zoned> ryanneufeld, so i have to call this helper function in a complete callback for the ajax, and also in the else, and pass in all the variables i needed from before the condition?
[12:55:32] <shoky> zoned: if (condition) { $.ajax(...).done(function(data) {  do stuff with response } ) }
[12:55:35] <zoned> that seems really messy
[12:56:42] <shoky> callbacks only seem messy when you're not used to them
[12:57:20] <ryanneufeld> zoned: it's less messy than the alternative
[12:57:52] <zoned> no, what seems messy is saying     if (condition) { $.ajax({complete: function() { helperFunction(var1, var2, var3, var4, var5, var6, var7); }); } else { helperFunction(var1, var2, var3, var4, var5, var6, var7); }      vs simply using async:false ?
[12:57:53] <luca_13> hey guys
[12:58:14] <shoky> huh
[12:58:16] <luca_13> http://pastebin.com/rNQ6SSUR
[12:58:27] <luca_13> i think ive made a novie mistake here
[12:58:36] <luca_13> im probably not calling my functions properly
[12:58:49] <luca_13> or perhaps got my initial syntax wrong
[12:59:03] <luca_13> any help would be appreciated
[12:59:40] <zoned> shoky, is that really my only alternative?
[12:59:54] <shoky> zoned: what are the 7 vars for..
[12:59:58] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @ luca_13
[13:00:05] <zoned> the 7 vars are declared before the ajax
[13:00:21] <shoky> why do you need to pass them as parameters
[13:00:32] <shoky> uh
[13:00:44] <johnkpaul> bot's gone again?
[13:00:52] <zoned> notice how im running the code in the if and in the else.... thats why i need them...
[13:00:54] <johnkpaul> luca_13: please make an example that we can actually test on jsfiddle.net
[13:01:11] <luca_13> ok johnkpaul ill make one now
[13:01:14] <ryanneufeld> zoned: can you put your code in a paste?
[13:01:20] <ryanneufeld> jsfiddle or pastebin
[13:01:40] <ryanneufeld> zoned: There is a better way to accomplish what your doing I'm certain.
[13:02:35] <shoky> zoned:  function f() { helperFunction(var1, var2, var3, var4, var5, var6, var7) }       if (condition) { $.ajax({complete: f}) } else { f() }
[13:04:07] <zoned> ryanneufeld, shoky, line #10 is the important one: http://pastebin.com/gDCNXYWr
[13:04:56] <zoned> i exaggerated the 7 vars, it would only be 3, but the concept still seems messy
[13:05:02] <shoky> it's not
[13:05:26] <zoned> so how would you rewrite this/
[13:05:35] <zoned> ? thanks :/
[13:05:46] <shoky> you'd put anything that depends on the ajax call in an ajax callback
[13:06:04] <shoky> instead of just after the ajax call
[13:06:24] <zoned> i understand callbacks, but its just weird because i want to execute this code regardless
[13:06:54] <shoky> i donno what that .fetch is
[13:07:11] <zoned> oh sorry, this is backbone.js, fetch is just a wrapper for $.ajax
[13:07:22] <zoned> it takes all the same parameters and calls it behind the scenes
[13:07:31] <shoky> and it probably returns a promise or a deferred or jqXHR or something?
[13:07:54] <zoned> replace partGroups.fetch with $.ajax for this example
[13:07:58] <shoky> ok
[13:08:14] <luca_13> ok @ johnkpaul & ryanneufeld http://jsfiddle.net/d4e8B/   http://pastebin.com/rNQ6SSUR
[13:08:30] <luca_13> its my first time using paste bin so appologies if ive done something wrong
[13:08:39] <johnkpaul> luca_13: check the console, there are errors
[13:08:50] <johnkpaul> try to make a working test case, so we can run your code and replicate your problem
[13:09:49] <luca_13> johnkpaul: how do i check console? do u mean fire bug?
[13:09:53] <johnkpaul> yes
[13:10:50] <luca_13> am i right i thinking if im running this through mamp i wont get consol errors?
[13:11:03] <ryanneufeld> luca_13: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/d4e8B/1/ start with that
[13:11:15] <ryanneufeld> just got it more working in jsfiddle
[13:11:46] <shoky> zoned: maybe something like this http://pastebin.com/RqG22D8s
[13:12:29] <gho5t> how do you access a variable set in a widget?
[13:12:30] <luca_13> ryanneufeld: what have u changed so i know what to look for
[13:12:47] <zoned> shoky, .always ?
[13:12:52] <ryanneufeld> you don't need the html/head/body tags
[13:13:11] <ryanneufeld> luca_13: and you don't need the script tag in the script section
[13:13:19] <shoky> zoned:  same as .complete
[13:13:20] <ryanneufeld> luca_13: and you need to select jquery from left
[13:13:27] <zoned> ah ok
[13:13:33] <luca_13> lol my bad
[13:13:39] <luca_13> apologies all a bit new ot me
[13:14:18] <mmealling1> wow... look at all the people. OK, here's my question: I'm using an API that returns paginated results as JSON. I have to retrieve the first page in order to find out how many pages there are total. Once all of the pages have been retrieved I need to sort the results and populate an <ol> with the results. I can't quite figure out where to put the $.when.apply($,arrayofdeferreds).then(function() { funstuff }); call.
[13:15:06] <shoky> all the people look right back at you
[13:15:11] <mmealling1> if I put it in the call back for the first one it gets there before its had a chance to populate the array with all of the deferreds.
[13:15:15] <mmealling1> shoky ;-)
[13:15:46] <mmealling1> I not only need to wait until all of the pages have returned but I need to wait to call the $.when until after all of them have been kicked off, too.
[13:15:58] <shoky> you need to use $.when after making all the ajax calls
[13:16:08] <brx_> http://facingworlds.co.uk/hez2  <-- the "portrait" link calls the ajax function...i get the alert(html) fine, however the div is not updated with the response
[13:16:32] <mmealling1> right.... I need to figure out how to wait until I've called 'em all...
[13:16:38] <shoky> mmm
[13:16:50] <mmealling1> since they're all async it gets to the $.when before all of 'em are called.
[13:17:20] <shoky> the .ajax() calls themselves are async too?
[13:17:23] <mmealling1> yes
[13:17:42] <mmealling1> (synchronous ajax is just wrong.... so so wrong)
[13:18:06] <shoky> no i dont mean if the ajax request is async
[13:18:07] <shoky> thats fine
[13:18:31] <mmealling1> I think, even with the awesomeness that is Deferred, that I still have to cont them and create a call back that tracks them....
[13:18:35] <gho5t> what is synchronous ajax
[13:18:37] <mmealling1> s/cont/count.
[13:18:55] <ajpiano> mmealling1: you don't have to do that
[13:18:56] <shoky> nah i dont think you do
[13:19:01] <ajpiano> you can run $.when on arbitrary number of dfds
[13:19:02] <mmealling1> you _can_ setup an ajax request that is synchronous... i.e. it blocks the browser until it finished....
[13:19:02] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/hGgcU/
[13:19:05] <shoky> there we go
[13:19:54] <luca_13> ok ryanneufeld  http://jsfiddle.net/d4e8B/2/ i made some minor tweeks to the html to remove the images and make it clearer what im doing
[13:19:54] <mmealling1> ajpiano, right... and I'm using the $.when.apply($,arrayofdfds) method....
[13:20:20] <luca_13> am i right in thinking the problem is in the script section and not calling the 2 on click functions properly?
[13:20:32] <mmealling1> reading that fiddle closely to make sure I'm not missing something.
[13:21:01] <shoky> i don't think you are
[13:21:38] <ajpiano> mmealling1: are you trying to wait for when some *more* processing inside of all those files has completed, after they load?
[13:22:13] <shoky> you could set up in advance an array of $.Deferred for all the requests i suppose
[13:22:26] <ajpiano> mmealling1: you can use Deferred.pipe() for that, if that's the case
[13:22:55] <mmealling1> ajpiano, nope.... the problem is I don't know 'i' before hand.... in my case 'i' is determined from the result of an initial getJSON() call. I have to parse its results to get i and then iterate.
[13:23:13] <ajpiano> you don't need to know i beforehand
[13:23:20] <ajpiano> you just pop all the deferreds into an array
[13:23:53] <mmealling1> right... but since that first ajax call is _also_ async, I end up getting to the $.when before thingies is populated.
[13:24:27] <mmealling1> I think shoky might have it.....
[13:24:38] <shoky> then you can pipe or call $.when  when the first call is done
[13:24:39] <shoky> resolved
[13:24:56] <ajpiano> ya i do believe that is the case
[13:25:20] <mmealling1> so two when's.... one for when the first one is .done and one for when the rest are .done.... hmm...
[13:25:28] <ryanneufeld> zoned: you watching this? Cause this is how you solve your problem
[13:25:36] <ryanneufeld> zoned: using promises
[13:26:05] <dawin> hi all
[13:26:17] <ezio> how do i pass in additional get values for autocomplete?
[13:26:32] <dawin> does someone has a viewport validation onhand, just for if element.height > viewport.bottom
[13:26:56] <ajpiano> ezio: you use a custom source: callback, or you can dynamically reset the autocomplete's "url" option to include your params in the URL as they change
[13:27:39] <ezio> ajpiano, what do you mean by a custom source: callback
[13:28:18] <ajpiano> ezio: look at the docs for autocomplete
[13:28:21] <ezio> like sourc: function(){ return 'search.php
[13:28:23] <ajpiano> you can provide a custom function to source:
[13:29:05] <ajpiano> ezio: it's more like source: function(request, response) {  $.ajax({data: {q: request.term}, success: response});   })
[13:36:53] <johnkpaul> Logikos: you were looking for a better understanding of index earlier, right?
[13:39:28] <ajpiano> mmealling1: http://jsfiddle.net/hGgcU/1/
[13:40:26] <ajpiano> mmealling1: it gets a random number of requests from the server first and then does them all, and then resolves the second callback whn all are complete
[13:41:27] <johnkpaul> Logikos: http://johnkpaul.tumblr.com/post/22601168279/demystifying-jquerys-index I wrote up my thoughts, because after you asked originally, I confused myself for a bit
[13:42:08] <raj> shoky, you were right
[13:42:22] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: if you want to expand on it
[13:42:30] <ajpiano> slash understand more
[13:42:40] <ajpiano> you should know that index with DOM element argument was the only signature until 1.3
[13:42:50] <ajpiano> and then some guy named ajpiano got the other two signatures added
[13:42:58] <raj> how can I skip the first .each() loop? with a break?
[13:43:00] <johnkpaul> ah, haha
[13:43:04] <raj> i do'nt wanna break out of the whole thing
[13:43:09] <johnkpaul> well I didn't know the history, but it all makes sense now
[13:43:11] <raj> just that particular loop
[13:43:14] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: this would be good for the learning site tho
[13:43:23] <ajpiano> raj:  return true
[13:43:32] <raj> ah ok, thank you
[13:43:34] <johnkpaul> oh that's true, is there a page for .index()?
[13:43:57] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: not yet :)
[13:44:26] <johnkpaul> :) I'll add something this weekend
[13:44:45] <johnkpaul> how is learn.jquery.com going in general?
[13:45:10] <ajpiano> OKish
[13:45:20] <ajpiano> i need to convert the build over to use some new stuff that scott did
[13:46:07] <ajpiano> hopefully some version of it will be up by the conf
[13:47:05] <johnkpaul> that's cool, it'll be nice to see
[13:50:27] <ajpiano> you're tellin me :p
[13:51:34] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, do you need any help proofreading or doing something boring and simple...I could help if needed.
[13:51:45] <johnkpaul> ha, well don't worry, I have no idea how you get the time for it all, ajpiano
[13:52:07] <mmealling1> ajpiano aha! I have to read up on pipe since its still not clear but that definitely helps (seems more like what a pipe should be).
[13:52:17] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com
[13:52:20] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: your perspective as a consumer of the information would be pretty useful :)
[13:55:38] <hacks> What's the fastest way to create an element?
[13:55:48] <NoiseEee> hire someone
[13:56:22] <hacks> $("<div class='something'>"); Or $("<div class='something'/>"); $("<div class='something'></div>"); Or does it not really matter at all?
[13:56:56] <johnkpaul> :D
[13:57:03] <johnkpaul> I don't think it matters hacks
[13:57:08] <johnkpaul> I didn't think those were going to be your options
[13:57:44] <someprimetime> i prefer $('<div class="something" />'); but Eviltwin has a cool method for adding elements he's showed me before
[13:57:47] <someprimetime> forgot it now though
[13:58:11] <Whirl3d> \me is installing Ruby
[13:58:14] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:58:34] <someprimetime> can't get myself to get into ruby
[13:58:58] <someprimetime> python is what i'm using now since we use pylons @ work but i'm previously a php dude
[13:59:06] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: for learn.jquery.com?
[13:59:13] <Whirl3d> yup
[13:59:33] <someprimetime> what is this going to be?
[13:59:37] <someprimetime> an interactive jquery site?
[13:59:47] <johnkpaul> if there are any wrinkles in the README, make sure you note it down, Whirl3d
[13:59:49] <someprimetime> also when is the new plugins site coming back? i have a couple that i'd like to author
[14:00:03] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: don't let the plugin site stop you from writing plugins ;)
[14:00:13] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: don't worry haha i've been writing them
[14:00:16] <someprimetime> but i just would like to share them
[14:00:16] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, Eviltwin does this: $("<div>",{class:'someclass", left:"30px"});
[14:00:32] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: nice yeah that's the one
[14:00:41] <johnkpaul> that is probably faster than parsing the string
[14:00:48] <johnkpaul> but probably marginally
[14:01:08] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: it's going to be a learning resource for jquery
[14:01:23] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: sounds cool
[14:01:39] <troubleshoot> I'm having some problems with jquery.load not executing javascript in IE8 and lower, but my code is working in IE9 and other browsers (Firefox, Safari, etc.)...anyone care to take a look?
[14:01:46] <someprimetime> hey anyone know when the speakers will be announced for jquery con SF?
[14:01:53] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: if you have the tendency, you should write for it there are many issues open
[14:02:01] <johnkpaul> someprimetime: the speaker call ends on the 13th
[14:02:06] <johnkpaul> so sometime after that I believe
[14:02:16] <johnkpaul> I really need to finish my proposals and send them in
[14:02:20] <someprimetime> johnkpaul: sounds good thanks for the info
[14:02:28] <ajpiano> someprimetime: yeah, i'm aiming to wrap up the speaker selection very quickly
[14:02:31] <ajpiano> after the CFP closes
[14:02:47] <ajpiano> it's gonna be pretty damn solid though, i can say that much
[14:02:50] <someprimetime> ajpiano++
[14:03:05] <someprimetime> man i'm stoked
[14:05:02] <someprimetime> unfortunately paul irish said he'll be @ google's dumb conference which is a bummer but oh well
[14:07:25] <ajpiano> lol
[14:07:28] <ajpiano> i'm not good enough :(
[14:07:36] <ajpiano> teehee
[14:07:55] * tw2113 calls ajpiano the red-headed Paul Irish
[14:08:43] <tw2113> and a bit shorter
[14:09:37] <raj> johnkpaul, any javascript/jquery stuff ever happen in the ny area?
[14:10:01] <gho5t> two word
[14:10:03] <gho5t> s
[14:10:06] <gho5t> John.Resig
[14:10:12] <tw2113> who?
[14:10:14] <tw2113> *runs*
[14:10:21] <ajpiano> raj: yea, there is a jquery nyc meetup
[14:10:23] <gho5t> he's here lurking. always
[14:10:26] <ajpiano> next event is about deferreds
[14:10:30] <ajpiano> http://jqnyc.com
[14:10:33] <johnkpaul> raj: yes, there's a jquery meetup and the NYC.js usergorup
[14:10:40] * tw2113 does actually know who resig is
[14:10:41] <johnkpaul> and many other meetups actually
[14:10:44] <raj> nice, thanks
[14:10:48] <raj> ajpiano, you're from here too?
[14:11:33] <ajpiano> raj yep
[14:11:47] <troubleshoot> I need help. I'm having some problems with jquery.load not executing javascript in IE8 and lower, but my code is working in IE9 and other browsers (Firefox, Safari, etc.) http://paste.so/p/d13tm
[14:11:56] <raj> cool, where at?
[14:11:59] <troubleshoot> If you go to http://www.sweetteaschildrensboutique.com and add an item to the cart, then click "View Cart" it loads a blank page.
[14:12:18] <ajpiano> raj: i live in like, turtle bay right now
[14:12:41] <raj> nice area
[14:13:00] <ajpiano> you?
[14:13:17] <raj> i just moved back up from miami, so looking for a place in manhattan now
[14:13:25] <tw2113> any rumors of ninja's living there too ajpiano ? obviously no visible proof is possible
[14:13:34] <raj> in nj at my parents' place in the meantime
[14:14:02] <ajpiano> bummer.  i know the UES market rly well right now, i'm moving in a week :) just looked at a crapload of apts
[14:14:20] <ajpiano> tw2113: no ninjas
[14:14:43] <tw2113> darn...would have thought so with New York + Turtle Bay
[14:16:10] <gho5t> 5/10
[14:16:38] <brx_> http://facingworlds.co.uk/hez2  <-- the "portrait" link calls the ajax function...i get the alert(html) fine, however the div is not updated with the response
[14:16:44] <raj> ajpiano, nice, have you checked out 99 John Street by any chance?
[14:17:01] <raj> going to look at that place tomorrow
[14:17:10] <raj> ..not that it's UES
[14:17:16] <ajpiano> i've never been there, i think i heard of someone who lives in it
[14:18:11] <johnkpaul> raj: I always recommend roosevelt island to people moving to the city
[14:18:25] <johnkpaul> officially, it is manhattan, even though it's really queens
[14:18:47] <raj> i've gotta be reasonably close to brooklyn since I'll have to work there as well
[14:19:00] <gho5t> brx_: $("#jqb_slides").innerHTML(html);
[14:19:13] <gho5t> you're using native javascript when you use innerHTML, not jQuery
[14:19:15] <gho5t> try .html()
[14:19:40] <raj> johnkpaul, yeah, i've been there for a party before, decent area
[14:20:19] <brx_> gho5t: if i do .html("string"); it works...however it wont load the actual response, which some be some images
[14:21:20] <gho5t> not really sure what you mean
[14:21:44] <brx_> the ajax returns some html, i want the div images to update
[14:22:21] <brx_> if u load page,click portrait, and then read the alert
[14:22:32] <brx_> i want that image to dispalyed in the carousel instead
[14:23:07] <gho5t> and what is wrong with changing $("#jqb_slides").innerHTML(html); to $("#jqb_slides").html(html); like I suggested?
[14:23:18] <brx_> i have
[14:24:21] <brx_> in success i remove the current images, and then use .html to add the new html, hoping for the image to change
[14:25:00] <silverwind> lol
[14:25:06] <silverwind> Haha
[14:25:09] <shoky> HEHE
[14:25:11] <silverwind> .innerHTML is not a function
[14:26:08] <DerekPioneer> can't get inarray working on "var fontMap = {'arial' : {} };
[14:26:10] <DerekPioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/38cx3/
[14:26:47] <shoky> is that an array?
[14:27:07] <shoky> @ DerekPioneer
[14:27:18] <DerekPioneer> no but it works the same way
[14:27:21] <DerekPioneer> lol
[14:27:24] <shoky> no, but it doesn't
[14:27:33] <gehsekky> lol
[14:27:34] <DerekPioneer> it's an object literal
[14:27:37] <DerekPioneer> what now?
[14:27:37] <shoky> indeed
[14:27:56] <shoky> i doubt you'll get inarray to work with an object literal
[14:28:06] <DerekPioneer> where's the inObjectLiteral() function?
[14:28:06] <shoky> as its for arrays
[14:28:37] <silverwind> DerekPioneer, I guess you could use a "if" statement
[14:28:50] <shoky> or 'in'
[14:28:55] <silverwind> Right
[14:29:10] <gehsekky> man, remember for loops with shortcircuits?
[14:29:12] <pachet> ?eval ('foo' in {foo:'foo'})
[14:29:14] <bot-t> pachet: true
[14:30:13] <shoky> ?eval {foo:'bar'}['blarg'] === undefined
[14:30:14] <bot-t> shoky: false
[14:30:21] <shoky> mMm
[14:30:26] <shoky> ?eval {foo:'bar'}['blarg'] == undefined
[14:30:27] <bot-t> shoky: false
[14:30:34] <shoky> FUCK U OK
[14:30:58] <gnarf> DerekPioneer: are you searching for a key or a value on the object?
[14:31:26] <DerekPioneer> key,eval( 'needle' in haystackObjectLiteral) works
[14:31:38] <shoky> ?eval (function() { var a = {foo:'bar'}; return a['blarg'] === undefined; })()
[14:31:39] <bot-t> shoky: true
[14:31:59] <DerekPioneer> i really hate my programming self 4 months ago
[14:32:11] <DerekPioneer> i designed this whole program using object literals like arrays
[14:32:11] <gho5t> i'm like that every month
[14:32:15] <shoky> ?eval ({foo:'bar'})['blarg'] === undefined
[14:32:16] <bot-t> shoky: true
[14:32:18] <gho5t> man i sucked last month
[14:32:19] <shoky> ho
[14:32:22] <DerekPioneer> haha
[14:32:24] <gnarf> DerekPioneer: don't use eval() ;)
[14:32:38] <gnarf> DerekPioneer: eval is just the command to get the bot to run it... I prefer ?js
[14:32:42] <DerekPioneer> gnarf: haha yeah i was just using that to explain what i meant
[14:32:44] <DerekPioneer> badly
[14:32:51] <gnarf> ?js "less confusing than eval"
[14:32:52] <bot-t> gnarf: "less confusing than eval"
[14:33:05] <shoky> mm what's the diff
[14:33:27] <gnarf> nothing, but since eval() is evil - using ?eval might make someone think they need to use eval()
[14:33:35] <gnarf> also js is 2 characters shorter than eval
[14:33:54] <shoky> ohh i didnt see he mentioned eval too
[14:33:55] <shoky> k
[14:35:18] <mrevd> any one ever see a slideDown only ease half way and they jump to the finish
[14:35:19] <mrevd> ?
[14:37:39] <Logikos> johnkpaul-afk: very useful information, ty for posting ...
[14:43:34] <thenickb> Hi all! Trying to lazyload images inside a carousel (using lazyload and jcarousel scripts). Can't get it to work based off of prev/next button clicks. Got this so far... no go http://pastebin.com/DJ49T1Rm
[14:43:45] <thenickb> I'm open to other solutions as well
[14:45:16] <johnwpayneerz> how does this work?
[14:45:36] <thenickb> how does what work?
[14:45:43] <johnwpayneerz> this
[14:45:44] <johnwpayneerz> freenode
[14:45:50] <johnwpayneerz> is this for developers?
[14:46:00] <ajpiano> ?w IRC @ johnwpayneerz
[14:46:01] <bot-t> johnwpayneerz, Internet Relay Chat - Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a protocol for real-time Internet text messaging (chat) or synchronous conferencing. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat
[14:46:11] <johnwpayneerz> okay
[14:46:13] <johnwpayneerz> now
[14:46:17] <thenickb> freenode is the server
[14:46:18] <johnwpayneerz> do i chat with?
[14:46:24] <shoky> you chat with
[14:46:24] <thenickb> then you join channels based on topics
[14:46:28] <johnwpayneerz> okay
[14:46:30] <johnwpayneerz> great
[14:46:35] <johnwpayneerz> i guess im in the right channel
[14:46:45] <johnwpayneerz> because i am having a jquery infinite scroll problem
[14:46:57] <johnwpayneerz> at first i thought it was the masonry but i doubt it now
[14:47:00] <thenickb> well then yes, you are correct
[14:47:18] <thenickb> about the right place that is
[14:47:29] <johnwpayneerz> great
[14:47:36] <johnwpayneerz> so who do i ask for support
[14:47:45] <raj> can I .clone() .mydiv, which has a child div with .slider() on it, and have the cloned parent div have a working slider as well? (using deep cloning or whatever)
[14:47:57] <ajpiano> johnwpayneerz: if this is your first time on IRC, you might want to read see ?help
[14:47:58] <bot-t> johnwpayneerz, Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[14:48:06] <johnwpayneerz> lets read it
[14:50:45] <brianloveswords> A++++ would read again
[14:51:17] <shoky> raj: that would clone the events too, for the first slider. so when you move the cloned one it'll move the first one
[14:51:30] <raj> oh
[14:51:33] <shoky> like this :D http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/N63wV/13/
[14:51:35] <raj> k, don't want that
[14:52:28] <raj> nice :)
[14:52:53] <studio> hi, i'm trying to append a link to the head part of the html document to add a favicon from inside a click event, is this possible with $(this).parents('head').append(....);? because it doesn't appear to work
[14:53:17] <studio> or, should i just add the code already, add a class name then just reach it that way?
[14:54:21] <xec> studio: what is "this" in this context?
[14:54:51] <xec> studio: why don't you just do $("head").append(...)
[14:57:39] <studio> xec: this could be something like a button inside the body
[14:58:02] <studio> and i didn't know you could do $("head").append!
[14:58:37] <studio> that's ok, thanks, i'll try that
[14:59:03] <xec> studio: be sure to leave the channel so you can't give any more feedback :)
[14:59:08] <xec> or wait
[14:59:10] <xec> :P
[15:22:50] <devOlsen_> why do I love the jquery room? No PM's plz! heh although I know this means no personal messages.. I can't help but feel this really means no project managers allowed in here!
[15:24:44] <ryanneufeld> devOlsen_: you know, that would be good too... in some cases
[15:25:09] <rhizmoe> i have a series of 1-character text-boxes, how can i advance to the next box when a character is typed into one? keyup?
[15:31:34] <rhizmoe> quiet today
[15:37:00] <hacks> does jquery animate have the ability to animate scroll?
[15:37:45] <ajpiano> hacks: $("#somethingWithScrollbars")animate({scrollTop: "150px"}, 500); should work
[15:37:55] <hacks> ajpiano: ok pokay
[15:39:22] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you missed a period
[15:39:32] <ajpiano> oh no, am i pregnant?
[15:39:32] <ryanneufeld> pretty sure it's not mine :p
[15:39:37] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[15:40:14] <ryanneufeld> $("#somethingWithScrollbars").animate({scrollTop: "150px"}, 500);
[15:46:40] <hacks> jquery ui, build I made: How do I remember what I built? I want easings.
[15:46:43] <hacks> How do i just add?
[15:49:01] <hacks> How do I just add a component to my already made jQuery UI build?
[15:52:16] <BigWings> i want to click on a button, then spawn a draggable object underneath the cursor and drag right away
[15:52:25] <BigWings> how would I do that?
[15:52:53] <BigWings> right now the drag only works the next time i click
[15:55:25] <shoky> rhizmoe: keyup works
[15:56:34] <rhizmoe> any hints as to getting backspace involved as well?
[15:56:48] <rhizmoe> shoky: by that, i mean "thanks! and..."
[15:56:51] <shoky> its a key, no?
[15:57:10] <rhizmoe> it is a key. i'll save it for phase 2
[15:57:32] <shoky> it's keyCode is 8
[15:57:34] <shoky> its
[15:57:36] <wfq> hi guys
[15:58:07] <rhizmoe> shoky: thanks, hopefully that gets me a chunk of the way there
[15:59:13] <wfq> I am having a problem that i don't know how to solve. Through an ajax request I terminate a session of teh current user. After that I'd like to redirect them to the login page. The problem is that as I do the ajax call first and need to wait for it to finished, I can't capture the callback. I have used error and success and done, but nothing.
[15:59:37] <shoky> nothing?
[16:00:03] <wfq> sorry, I meant that they don't seem to be called
[16:00:22] <shoky> ?paste
[16:00:22] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:00:40] <ryanneufeld> wfq are you modifying location at all after your ajax call?
[16:00:55] <ryanneufeld> wfq: if you are, then you should do that in the .done() callback
[16:01:29] <dov23> hi, I can't seem to get .unload() to trigger at all
[16:03:15] <dov23> is it supported for the latest chrome?
[16:03:17] <shoky> dov23: maybe you dont notice it triggered?
[16:03:30] <shoky> how are you using it
[16:03:45] <dov23> shoky: $(window).unload(function() {
[16:03:46] <dov23>         alert('Handler for .unload() called.');
[16:03:46] <dov23>       });
[16:04:06] <wfq> ryanneufeld, well I have tried in done but nothing happens either. I get a 302 Moved temporary code but done isn't called either
[16:04:31] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure how .ajax handles a 302
[16:04:33] <shoky> dov23: who says you can alert there?
[16:04:36] <dov23> it's within a jQuery(document).ready(function($) { … }
[16:05:45] <dov23> shoky: who says you can't ?
[16:07:16] <shoky> dov23: when i try to alert i get: Blocked alert('NOOO') during unload.
[16:07:30] <shoky> when just console.log i get:  NOOO
[16:07:40] <dov23> shoky: can I do a window.location = "http://www.yoururl.com"; ?
[16:07:47] <dov23> shoky: to redirect?
[16:07:58] <shoky> i donno, but i doubt it
[16:10:17] <Buddydude> Hi, I am fairly new to JQuery. Here's a little snippet of code: http://jsfiddle.net/RgH8y/ I am getting the error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'ready'
[16:10:32] <Buddydude> I'm sure it is a simple fix.
[16:12:10] <shoky> Buddydude: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/RgH8y/1/
[16:12:37] <rhizmoe> hrm, will next() find a sibling if the same level is composed of input[type='text'] fields?
[16:12:56] <Buddydude> ah
[16:12:59] <Buddydude> thanks
[16:12:59] <shoky> Buddydude actually i donno if thats what you want or if that works
[16:13:04] <Buddydude> oh
[16:13:05] <Buddydude> ok ill test
[16:13:33] <beancurd> Buddydude, you were missing a ) and had a ) where a } should be.
[16:15:10] <dov23> shoky: so what exactly can I do in unload()
[16:17:34] <dov23> shoky: http://api.jquery.com/unload/ has alert as it's example
[16:17:51] <shoky> yes. chrome blocks alerts though
[16:17:57] <shoky> they should change that
[16:18:23] <shoky> dov23: you can clean up stuff
[16:18:42] <dov23> shoky: I am trying to fix an issue where users clicking 'back' in the browser don't get a broken ajaxy form
[16:18:46] <shoky> you can bind to the 'beforeload' event and return a string which the user will see
[16:18:49] <ryanneufeld> shoky: no, people should stop using alerts for things that aren't alerting
[16:18:51] <shoky> and he can choose to stay in the page or not
[16:19:02] <shoky> ryanneufeld: that's irrelevant
[16:19:16] <BigWings> anyone know how to append a new object and start dragging it with the same mousedown that created it?
[16:19:40] <BigWings> like right away
[16:20:02] <ryanneufeld> BigWings: you might want to look at the draggable and dropables in jquery UI
[16:20:02] <BigWings> cuz right now i need to realease the mouse and click again before i can drag it
[16:20:13] <ryanneufeld> they have the ability to clone the thing you want to drag
[16:20:24] <BigWings> instead of just draggable?
[16:20:34] <BigWings> cuz im using jquery draggable
[16:21:01] <shoky> BigWings i don't think there's a simple way to do that with the current ui API
[16:21:10] <shoky> but lemme know if you find one ;)
[16:22:01] <BigWings> hmm
[16:22:08] <BigWings> sucks :/
[16:22:12] <shoky> i had a similar issue myself, yah
[16:22:16] <ryanneufeld> BigWings: do you have an example we can see?
[16:22:22] <shoky> i actually haven't properly solved it yet
[16:23:32] <BigWings> http://aeonvirtual.com/Imagine/
[16:23:40] <BigWings> only tested in firefox and on a pc
[16:24:00] <BigWings> if you double click on the cnvas it makes a remark popup
[16:24:17] <BigWings> then the idea is if you drag from the orange cicle you can drag an arrow
[16:24:39] <shoky> (works fine in chrome)
[16:25:05] <BigWings> i spawn a little red div that is draggable to which i want to point the arrow but the div is only draggable on the second click
[16:25:45] <shoky> you could put one with opacity:0 or smth
[16:25:49] <shoky> to begin with
[16:26:06] <BigWings> ahh... yeah that could probably work
[16:26:22] <BigWings> so i already have one ready to go and i spawn the next one as soon as ai drag the first
[16:26:31] <shoky> yah
[16:26:47] <BigWings> sounds like the best option so far
[16:26:56] <BigWings> lets try that
[16:26:59] <BigWings> :)
[16:27:05] <shoky> ;>
[16:29:55] <Buddydude> Anyone have any ideas why the code at http://jsfiddle.net/RTVBJ/ gives me the error of: Error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'setVariables'?
[16:30:43] <shoky> cause that new window doesnt have the method
[16:31:52] <shoky> its local to the original window
[16:32:01] <Buddydude> uh
[16:32:06] <shoky> ohhh
[16:32:10] <shoky> just saw that its 2 files
[16:32:13] <Buddydude> yeah
[16:32:46] <shoky> dunno
[16:33:21] <Buddydude> hmm
[16:36:00] <infinity2> hey guys i need to bind a resize event from an iframe to parent document, can u see what i am doing wrong? $(window, parent.document).resize(function () { alert('resized'); });
[16:38:00] <wfq> guys, Could it be that placing an ajax requst within a setInterval is not possible due to by the time the data is back to the browser, there is no a javascript thread waiting for it? --->http://dpaste.com/744500/
[16:39:54] <demitrix> Hello all, I'm curious if anyone would point me in the right direction. I have an $.ajax call and i need to check the response for an error, since the server reports success even if the response contains an error code. Is there a way to check the response and if needed handle the error and resubmit the original $.ajax call?
[16:46:26] <rhizmoe> is there a cleaner way to represent this? $(this).next('input')[0].focus()
[16:46:40] <rhizmoe> to navigate between a series of text input fields
[16:47:07] <rhizmoe> the next()[0] i guess i'm mainly wondering about, whether there is an "immediate neighbor" type function
[16:47:16] <rhizmoe> "function" sorry i'm weak on terminology
[16:47:26] <rhizmoe> method, i suppose.
[16:47:51] <demitrix> you shouldnt need the [0] after next anyhow
[16:48:02] <demitrix> it should point yuo right at the next input
[16:49:39] <demitrix> did that help rhizmoe?
[16:53:52] <sekyms> ajpiano: you around per chance?
[16:58:03] <rhizmoe> demitrix: trying now
[16:59:13] <rhizmoe> demitrix: yeah, thanks. i had been experimenting and it seemed like next() returned all siblings
[16:59:31] <rhizmoe> (which i'm sure is another existing method ;)
[17:02:13] <raj> i've got a jquery collection $elements, that are basically all duplicates. I want to remove all the duplicates except 2, what would be the cleanest/most efficient way to do that?
[17:02:33] <Jon47> rhizmoe: it only returns the immediate next sibling, but it does so for each element in the jquery collection
[17:02:49] <Jon47> read the docs: http://api.jquery.com/next/
[17:02:52] <ha6aha6a> hello. i am adding fields to a form with $(some div).append('some input tags').  i have to add as many fields as there are rows in a table on the page. i have a for loop that loops as many times as there are table rows. what i don't know is how to distinguish one field from another. if i give the first field the id="firstname" then they all get it. what i want is id="firstname1" id="firstname2" an
[17:02:54] <ha6aha6a> d so on. is that doable?
[17:03:21] <sekyms> "firstname" + i
[17:04:15] <sekyms> ha6aha6a: put the iterator in the id
[17:04:47] <ha6aha6a> sekyms: i tried that but it didn't work. let me try it again
[17:05:19] <sekyms> then you are doing something wrong
[17:07:58] <ha6aha6a> sekyms:  is it ok to paste a line of code here?
[17:09:50] <rhizmoe> Jon47: thanks. i think i got mixed up with $(prev ~ next)
[17:10:11] <Jon47> a line only, no more
[17:15:58] <raj> man, crickets
[17:17:19] <ha6aha6a> sekyms: fixed it. thanks
[17:18:06] <sekyms> ha6aha6a: you fixed it not me :)
[17:19:07] <ha6aha6a> sekyms: with help from you
[17:19:32] <sekyms> pay it forward
[17:22:29] <raj> anyone know how I can remove all elements in a jquery collection except the first two?
[17:22:51] <sekyms> is it an array?
[17:23:39] <Eviltwin> raj: You mean call .remove() on all but the first two
[17:23:43] <Eviltwin> Or make a collection that is only the first two
[17:23:52] <sekyms> from the man
[17:23:52] <sekyms> http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-array-remove/
[17:24:02] <raj> those won't be the same result Eviltwin ?
[17:24:06] <raj> btw, welcome back :)
[17:24:13] <Eviltwin> raj: First leaves it in the collection but removes it from the document
[17:24:26] <Eviltwin> Second leaves it in the document but creates a new collection that doesn't contain those elements
[17:24:31] <raj> the $element hasn't yet been appended
[17:24:46] <Eviltwin> Calling .remove() still won't remove it from a collection
[17:24:55] <Buddydude> Anyone have any ideas why the code at http://jsfiddle.net/RTVBJ/ gives me the error of: Error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'setVariables'?
[17:24:59] <raj> I did $('.sometextarea') which is like 10 textareas
[17:24:59] <Eviltwin> For all intents and purposes collections are immutable
[17:25:03] <raj> i just want the first two though
[17:25:13] <Eviltwin> $('.sometextarea').slice(0,2)
[17:25:27] <sekyms> raj you could use underscore
[17:25:43] <raj> underscore?
[17:25:48] <Eviltwin> sekyms: He's using jQuery....
[17:25:49] <raj> a library?
[17:26:12] <Eviltwin> No need to introduce another library to do what jQuery already does if he's already using jQuery
[17:26:21] <sekyms> fair enough
[17:26:52] <sekyms> is there a pluck equivalent in query?
[17:27:12] <raj> Eviltwin, what happens if there's only 1 element in there, even though I'm attempting to slice(0,2)?
[17:27:26] <sekyms> get the length of it first
[17:27:50] <raj> k, just wanted to know if I had to do that
[17:27:55] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[17:28:02] <Eviltwin> It's fine
[17:28:08] <Eviltwin> It's not a problem if it's off the end
[17:28:23] <Eviltwin> It'll just have the one element
[17:28:31] <Eviltwin> Or if there are zero elements it'll be empty
[17:28:53] <Eviltwin> sekyms: Seems like you're not quite ready to be giving jQuery advice :P
[17:28:56] <raj> cool
[17:29:02] <raj> thank you Eviltwin
[17:29:16] <raj> I'm surprised they didn't include that info in the docs
[17:29:29] <sekyms> Eviltwin: fair enough
[17:30:19] <shoky> tf is pluck
[17:30:41] <Eviltwin> raj: Include which info?
[17:30:48] <shoky> oh, map
[17:31:15] <Eviltwin> raj: There are also :lt and :gt psuedo selectors
[17:31:17] <raj> Eviltwin, the info about it being valid for the slice range to go beyond that of the array it's slicing
[17:31:19] <Eviltwin> But I'm pretty sure they're slower than .slice
[17:31:22] <Eviltwin> Oh
[17:32:37] <Eviltwin> raj: It's actually just adding Array.prototype.slice to the jQuery object prototype
[17:32:47] <Eviltwin> I'm more surprised it doesn't seem to be documented here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
[17:34:57] <Eviltwin> raj: Also if at some point you're looking to grab just one element out, .eq
[17:36:44] <raj> Eviltwin, ok, so slicing it doesn't actually remove it --> var $myform = $('#myform').clone(); $myform.find('.mytextarea').slice(0,2)
[17:37:11] <raj> $(body).append($myform)
[17:37:17] <raj> $('body').append($myform)
[17:37:25] <systemfault> Slice doesn't remove, it creates a new array
[17:37:42] <raj> k, so what would be better in this case?
[17:38:09] <systemfault> raj: What do you want to do?
[17:38:22] <systemfault> raj: Just really remove the element from the array?
[17:38:31] <systemfault> I guess that .splice would do it
[17:38:40] <systemfault> But perhaps jquery has a nicer way
[17:38:45] <raj> .each(function(i,el){if(i<2)return true; $(el).remove()}) ?
[17:39:20] <raj> systemfault, I just want to append to body $myform, but not with the 20 textareas that were in the original that was cloned
[17:39:32] <raj> I just want the first two
[17:39:45] <systemfault> Then just slice it, no?
[17:40:12] <systemfault> $body.append($elements.slice(0, 2)); ?
[17:40:18] <raj> slicing it didn't actually remove it --> var $myform = $('#myform').clone(); $myform.find('.mytextarea').slice(0,2)
[17:40:56] <systemfault> Ah, the nodes are in the DOM and you want to remove them?
[17:41:03] <raj> unless I should do $myform = $myform.find('.mytextarea').slice(0,2)
[17:41:21] <raj> yes, from the clone
[17:42:32] <systemfault> I'll be honest… I don't understand what you would like to do… at all :(
[17:42:56] <raj> really? I just showed the code
[17:43:04] <coldhead> maybe the code is terrible
[17:43:08] <coldhead> does it have comments?
[17:43:09] <raj> probably
[17:43:17] <raj> i want to clone a form that exists
[17:43:27] <raj> except, in this clone, i want to remove all but the first two textareas
[17:43:32] <raj> and then append it
[17:43:34] <raj> to the body
[17:44:53] <shoky> you're not doing anything with the slice result
[17:45:08] <systemfault> var clone = $('form').clone(); clone.find('textarea').slice(2).each(function(){ $(this).remove(); }); ?
[17:45:20] <shoky> noo
[17:45:29] <shoky> they're not in the dom
[17:45:37] <systemfault> shoky: and?
[17:45:51] <shoky> so what would .remove() do?
[17:46:09] <systemfault> shoky: kill the node from that "DOM tree" fragment?
[17:46:19] <shoky> hm
[17:47:07] <systemfault> I'm just sceptical about the .slice part… not sure if it returns a jquery object.
[17:48:16] <shoky> it does http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[17:49:16] <systemfault> Hmm, I'll write a mini-test on jsfiddle
[17:49:40] <shoky> yah you're right about .remove()
[17:49:50] <shoky> just checked it
[17:49:56] <raj> so I should do .each() and use remove?
[17:50:19] <shoky> i guess? not sure..
[17:50:28] <Eviltwin> jQuery's not big on you modifying collections
[17:50:37] <raj> or $myform=$myform.find('.mytextarea').slice(0,2) ?
[17:50:39] <Eviltwin> It generally creates a new collection that has the modifications you requested
[17:50:40] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[17:50:41] <Eviltwin> Do that
[17:50:52] <raj> k
[17:50:52] <shoky> uhm but then you lose the form
[17:50:55] <shoky> no?
[17:51:07] <raj> that's what I was concerned about
[17:51:26] <Eviltwin> Hold on a sec
[17:51:38] <Eviltwin> This gets back to my question about DOM mutations vs. collection mutations
[17:51:53] <Eviltwin> Is your goal to remove the elements from where they are in the DOM
[17:51:58] <raj> no
[17:52:17] <raj> just in this cloned collection
[17:52:21] <raj> before I append it
[17:52:32] <Eviltwin> Still technically a DOM at that point
[17:52:37] <Eviltwin> Just not the DOM for the page
[17:52:41] <Eviltwin> So you are going to want remove
[17:52:48] <Eviltwin> $myform.find('.mytextarea').slice(2).remove();
[17:52:59] <Eviltwin> That was my confusion
[17:53:06] <systemfault> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/GFN9W/
[17:53:08] <Eviltwin> If it was something like I want to select the first two links on the page
[17:53:16] <Eviltwin> $("a").slice(0, 2)
[17:53:46] <shoky> systemfault: yep i see. thanx
[17:53:47] <Eviltwin> But if you want to create a copy of a div that only has all but the first two links removed
[17:54:05] <Eviltwin> $("#mydiv").clone().find("a").slice(0,2).remove().end().end();
[17:55:28] <raj> what's the end() for?
[17:55:53] <shoky> if you wanna do $myform=
[17:56:07] <shoky> in front
[17:56:36] <shoky> bah. so now i gotta re-read jq docs to see any place where 'THE DOM
[17:56:38] * mmealling falls down laughing.... 
[17:56:48] <shoky> bah. so now i gotta re-read jq docs to see any place where 'THE DOM' is mentioned
[17:56:57] <shoky> i thought that always meant .... THE DOM.
[17:57:04] <raj> ditto
[17:57:08] <systemfault> THE DOM!!!!!!!!!!
[17:57:08] <shoky> not.. The dom that this element is attached to
[17:57:10] <raj> ok, great, this worked
[17:57:14] <shoky> dum dum DOM
[17:57:15] <raj> .slice(2).remove()
[17:57:21] <raj> I didn't need .end() or anything
[17:57:40] <shoky> you'd need it if you slap an assignment in front of that line
[17:57:41] <systemfault> DOMination!
[17:57:56] <raj> oh ok, gotcha
[17:58:00] <mmealling> first attempt at ajpiano's recommended .pipe() solution ( http://jsfiddle.net/hGgcU/1/ ) just freaking works....fixed one typo, hit reload and bam, all ajax requests come through, results get sorted, and the output displayed.... awesome sauce....
[17:58:23] <mmealling> dude, if I was gay, I'd kiss you.
[17:58:30] <shoky> i think
[17:58:34] <shoky> yeah
[17:58:39] <shoky> your fiddle just broke chrome ;S
[17:58:46] <raj> shoky, any idea why .autogrow() is 8px larger in height for all the cloned textareas?
[17:59:24] <systemfault> mmealling: Yeah, the promise implementation is great in jquery
[17:59:33] <shoky> raj dunno
[17:59:47] <raj> k
[18:00:10] <shoky> did u watch ?!? !?! ?! ?!
[18:00:36] <velcrobots> anyone know why some of these headings are expanding correctly and others snapping closed as soon as they open?  http://jsfiddle.net/velcrobots/9XbcW/
[18:00:39] <raj> haha
[18:00:41] <raj> wathcing now
[18:00:58] <shoky> ;D
[18:00:59] <raj> 5 minutes in
[18:01:31] <shoky> velcrobots: wow
[18:01:48] <shoky> that's a lot of repetition
[18:02:25] <shoky> ?g DRY @ velcrobots
[18:02:26] <bot-t> velcrobots, Don't repeat yourself - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself
[18:03:06] <systemfault> Keep it DRY!
[18:03:31] <velcrobots> shoky: i know, i tried to assign a name= to the h2, then use var divname like we did with that other thing you helped me with, no deal
[18:05:23] <shoky> why do you have so many different classes
[18:05:27] <shoky> with obscure names
[18:06:14] <shoky> uhh
[18:06:18] <Buddydude> Anyone have any ideas why my code gives me the error of: Error: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object DOMWindow] has no method 'setVariables'? Here's the code  http://jsfiddle.net/RTVBJ/
[18:06:20] <velcrobots> because it's late and i suck
[18:06:24] <shoky> you're using .sp instead of #sp also
[18:06:26] <shoky> in all those
[18:06:40] <shoky> oh
[18:06:49] <shoky> you have both ids and classes with same obscure names, great
[18:07:16] <velcrobots> they're not entirely obscure, lmao, embroidery is em, for example
[18:08:44] <shoky> velcrobots: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/9XbcW/1/
[18:09:42] <velcrobots> get out of here!  next?  jeez
[18:10:17] <shoky> anytime you feel that you're even a tiny bit repeating yourself
[18:10:24] <shoky> then you're doing it wrong
[18:10:30] <shoky> most liekly
[18:10:46] <shoky> having a shared class is even better: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/9XbcW/2/
[18:10:57] <shoky> that's what classes are for

[18:14:37] <jjjrrmy> Can someone help me with the toggle function?
[18:15:21] <shoky> Can someone ask a real question?
[18:16:20] <beancurd> why are my socks always either too tight or too loose?
[18:16:41] <armorsmith42> Because you have lymph problems and need to work out more.
[18:17:29] <shoky> ouch
[18:18:10] <beancurd> damn.
[18:18:13] <beancurd> :(
[18:18:16] <Bankzilla> is there a script to change raw date data into how long ago it was posted? like a youtube system when it says 23mins ago etc
[18:18:49] <systemfault> Bankzilla: Check moment.js
[18:19:04] <Bankzilla> thank you
[18:19:12] <systemfault> You're welcome.
[18:23:34] <Guevara> hello guys! my function to show the json dict not works http://dpaste.com/744532/ =/
[18:28:58] <shoky> Buddydude: it works if you do $(users[userNum].win).load( function() { ....
[18:29:01] <shoky> instead of .ready
[18:31:10] <shoky> Guevara: $.each doesn't work with key:value arguments
[18:31:33] <shoky> hm
[18:31:35] <Guevara> ah, ok, how to do that?
[18:31:44] <shoky> actually that shouldn't matter i think
[18:32:01] <shoky> anyway your value is an array
[18:32:14] <Guevara> how to access?
[18:32:19] <systemfault> ?eval $.each({lol: 'rofl'}).each(function(k, v) { console.log (k); console.log(v); });
[18:32:20] <bot-t> systemfault: TypeError: callback is undefined
[18:32:27] <systemfault> Err
[18:32:53] <systemfault> ?eval $.each({lol: 'rofl'}, function(k, v) { console.log (k); console.log(v); });
[18:32:53] <bot-t> systemfault: "lol""rofl"{"lol": "rofl"}
[18:33:22] <Guevara> =/
[18:34:55] <systemfault> Guevara: .append(val[0]) ?
[18:35:23] <shoky> yea forget what i said about key:value i was totally wrong of course
[18:36:02] <Guevara> nothing happens with .append(val[0])
[18:36:04] <rogo> what is an elegant way to make an if statement is only checked until it is true once and then it ceases to be checked
[18:36:04] <Guevara> =/
[18:36:43] <shoky> ceases to be checked?
[18:36:49] <rogo> yeah
[18:37:00] <shoky> how can you check if you need to cease checking, without checking ?
[18:37:08] <rogo> my page is scrolling from top to bottom and things are called if the the scrollTop value is greater than x
[18:37:15] <Guevara> i tried .append(val['reposicao'] to... =
[18:37:18] <Guevara> =/
[18:37:24] <rogo> but I don't need to continue checking if it's greater than once it's been called once
[18:38:02] <rogo> thats my question for you shoky!
[18:38:21] <systemfault> Guevara: val['reposicao'][0] would work.
[18:38:23] <djcercone> got some jQuery code that hides a <select> element and creates a <ul> element to act like a dropdown.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to disable it if you need to?
[18:38:34] <shoky> rogo: you binded to an event and you want to unbind?
[18:39:14] <Guevara> nothing apperas in html systemfault =/
[18:39:18] <djcercone> I should add the <select>'s <option> elements get get copied over to <li>'s
[18:39:20] <Guevara> appears*
[18:39:37] <rogo> shoky: I think that's the case but I'm not using a bind, I'm just using an if statement and checking the scrollTop on every $(document).scroll
[18:39:56] <rogo> I'm probably not doing it the most efficient way
[18:39:57] <shoky> $(document).scroll binds the event
[18:40:23] <shoky> so you want to unbind?
[18:40:29] <rogo> I guess so
[18:40:39] <shoky> $(document).off('scroll')
[18:41:05] <rogo> within the if statement?
[18:41:17] <shoky> wherever you want to stop listening for the scroll event
[18:41:36] <shoky> so your callback function will stop getting called on every scroll
[18:42:08] <rogo> I have one function that happens on document.scroll, and then a bunch of if statements inside of it
[18:42:13] <rogo> is that a bad way to do this
[18:42:21] <shoky> nope
[18:42:30] <shoky> not that i know what your if statements look like ;P
[18:43:39] <rogo> haha
[18:45:02] <rogo> shoky: http://www.jsfiddle.net/DwmxZ/1/
[18:45:16] <rogo> this doesn't seem quite right, is this what you mean
[18:45:43] <shoky> i dont know, is it what you mean :)
[18:46:05] <rogo> well will it cause those if statements to only be called true one time
[18:46:30] <shoky> probably
[18:46:49] <rogo> okay
[18:46:50] <shoky> but
[18:46:52] <rogo> thanks for your help
[18:46:55] <shoky> if one of them is true
[18:46:59] <shoky> then you unbind
[18:47:05] <shoky> and then neither gets checked.. yes?
[18:47:09] <rogo> yeah
[18:47:11] <shoky> cool
[18:47:16] <rogo> no no
[18:47:17] <rogo> i mean
[18:47:20] <rogo> yes, thats a problem
[18:47:23] <rogo> no it's not what i want
[18:47:23] <shoky> ah.
[18:47:37] <shoky> then i dont really know what logic you're looking for
[18:47:43] <shoky> thats up to you ;p
[18:48:34] <rogo> well thanks for your help

[19:01:21] <aitiba> hi
[19:02:42] <rogo> shoky: why Is this not preventing my test from being called over and over again. i think it's a problem of scope? http://www.jsfiddle.com/DwmxZ/2/

[19:10:57] <xp_prg2> what is the best tree component to use with jquery?
[19:11:03] <xp_prg2> jstree looks extremely robust
[19:11:12] <xp_prg2> just curious if anyone has any experience with that
[19:11:32] <raj> xp_prg2, if I had to go back, I wouldn't use it
[19:12:05] <raj> there was another one I scoped out that looked much better (and actively developed, as opposed to jstree)
[19:14:43] <xp_prg2> raj which one, please, and thank you for your wonderful wisdom!!!!!!!!
[19:15:12] <raj> what're the alternatives you've seen?
[19:16:43] <xp_prg2> Treeview, SimpleTree, File Tree, Dynatree, Checkbox tree plugin, JQTreeTAble
[19:17:35] <shoky> rogo: that test variable is local to the callback function
[19:17:45] <shoky> gets reset to 0 each time..
[19:17:48] <shoky> well not reset
[19:18:02] <rogo> yeah
[19:18:13] <rogo> i realize
[19:18:22] <rogo> silly move, thanks again
[19:18:34] <xp_prg2> raj do you remember anything?
[19:19:40] <raj> xp_prg2, I think it was Dynatree
[19:19:46] <raj> looks like they changed their website up though
[19:19:49] <raj> (good sign again)
[19:20:19] <raj> oh yes, definitely dynatree
[19:20:49] <raj> shoky, pretty good episode
[19:20:49] <shoky> raj yer doing weird stuff there
[19:20:51] <shoky> aye
[19:20:56] <raj> it set a lot of stuff up
[19:21:24] <shoky> yea stuffs starting to happen finally
[19:21:32] <raj> you think that scumbag 2-faced dude recognized arya?
[19:21:39] <shoky> for sure
[19:21:44] <raj> ya, me too
[19:21:49] <shoky> but he wants to shag her mommy
[19:21:53] <shoky> so he'll help her
[19:21:58] <raj> does he?
[19:22:08] <shoky> i dunno , looks like it
[19:22:11] <raj> he's the guy that'll keep it to himself though until he can use it for some backroom leverage
[19:22:15] <beancurd> who?
[19:22:23] <shoky> baelish
[19:22:29] <beancurd> oh. little finger.
[19:22:32] <shoky> ya
[19:22:53] <beancurd> yeah. he wants a piece of lady northking person.
[19:22:55] <raj> we're all nerds in here
[19:23:16] <raj> he wants a piece of the chick that has the gay king
[19:23:37] <shoky> me too
[19:23:53] <raj> he sideways mouth thing pisses me off
[19:23:56] <raj> *her
[19:24:10] <raj> i'd definitely take khalisi
[19:24:15] <raj> have my way
[19:24:27] <shoky> ah she's not my type at all
[19:24:27] <raj> hope that giant black dude doesn't get to her first
[19:24:57] <raj> that'll ruin her gadget forever
[19:25:03] <shoky> heh
[19:26:17] <raj> shoky, what's weird about my code though?
[19:26:22] <raj> just cuz the tabs are in the titlebar?
[19:26:26] <shoky> all of it :\
[19:26:31] <raj> i was trying to be efficient with space
[19:26:32] <shoky> why are you building html in javascript
[19:26:58] <beancurd> raj: you really should be toggling show/hide.
[19:27:02] <shoky> and whats this line: $('.ui-dialog-titlebar').tabs()
[19:27:08] <beancurd> not insert/remove
[19:27:26] <raj> shoky, that's to turn the contained ul element into tabs
[19:27:39] <raj> as per the .tabs() docs, I need to select the containing div
[19:27:52] <shoky> then make your own
[19:28:04] <raj> make my own what?
[19:28:07] <shoky> containing div
[19:28:12] <raj> oh
[19:28:25] <raj> no bueno the way i did it?
[19:28:36] <raj> i didn't see a harm
[19:28:54] <raj> since there's no other ul element in the the titlebar anyway
[19:28:57] <shoky> not really, definitely not from a readability aspect
[19:29:11] * xp_prg2 hugs upon raj
[19:29:14] <raj> oh
[19:29:52] <shoky> hooking into jquery ui things that look like they maybe might be a good candidate to run .tabs() on.. or something like that,
[19:29:59] <shoky> is never a good idea
[19:30:06] <raj> k
[19:30:37] <shoky> put divs everywhere ;D
[19:31:07] <shoky> gnight
[19:32:23] <raj> rawr, still doesn't work =T
[19:32:26] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/8qqqL/10/
[19:32:28] <raj> goodnight though
[19:33:10] <raj> oh, before you head out, what was the 1up you hit me with when someone had asked how to replace a container with simply its contents? and you 1uped my .replaceWith() with some other method that did it in one shot
[19:33:14] <raj> shoky^^
[19:33:31] <shoky> mm
[19:33:51] <shoky> maybe unwrap?
[19:34:02] <raj> yes
[19:34:03] <raj> that was it
[19:34:06] <raj> thanks :)
[19:34:09] <tash> anyone familiar with the datatables plugin? datatables.net
[19:34:11] <shoky> ;)
[19:35:26] <raj> can someone tell me why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/8qqqL/10/
[19:35:49] <lenswipe> hey guys
[19:36:52] <onats> hi guys, what solution do you guys use for an image rotate + crop
[19:37:39] <beancurd> raj, you're not removing the #tabdiv on !checked
[19:38:17] <raj> beancurd, yes, that's just cuz of my recent change
[19:38:26] <raj> but the tabs don't work correctly on creation
[19:39:02] <beancurd> i wasn't aware they were supposed to be tabs o_o
[19:39:09] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/8qqqL/11/
[19:41:28] <tash> on this page: http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/basic_init/zero_config.html you should see "Previous" and "Next" buttons on the bottom right of the table. In my working example, my previous and next buttons are on the bottom left, no arrows, nothing...just plain text.  Any ideas?
[19:42:03] <ndimatteo> hey all, seems the documentation or infinite-scroll.js by paul irish is a bit outdated. Trying to run a manual behavior with it, but it loses it's feature to remove the first pages nextSelector and bind to the new pages nextSelector. Any ideas?
[19:42:33] <ndimatteo> using this: https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/blob/master/behaviors/manual-trigger.js
[19:45:30] <ndimatteo> any ideas?

[20:14:09] <raj> phoenixsampras, put the script in $(document).ready(function(){ /* here */ })
[20:15:02] <phoenixsampras> oh ...
[20:15:05] <phoenixsampras> let me see

[20:21:23] <luvmyh0nda> Hi, I am trying to implement 2 separate accordions on one page. The left-half of the page is loaded at a different time than the right-half of the page. Both accordions are present, but when I click a tab on the second-loaded (right-half) accordion, the left accordion closes as well... any ideas?
[20:27:31] <xp_prg2> raj I need to have both radio buttons and checkboxes in my tree, is that possible?
[20:27:40] <raj> yes
[20:28:00] <raj> oops, sorry
[20:28:03] <raj> thought you were someone else
[20:28:14] <raj> but to answer you, "probably"
[20:28:59] <systemfault> Here's a tree with radio buttons and checkboxes: http://hakim.se/experiments/css/domtree/
[20:29:44] <raj> that is freaking awesome
[20:30:15] <xp_prg2> raj there appears to be only 3 select modes in dynatree
[20:30:25] <xp_prg2> they don't mix it appears
[20:30:57] <raj> i've never played with it, only glanced over the api and examples
[20:31:11] <raj> a very long time ago
[20:31:36] <xp_prg2> but you use jstree right?
[20:32:30] <coldhead> Some people have a genuine fear of processed meats. This is known as Carnodevonphobia.
[20:34:01] <phoenixsampras> ok raj
[20:34:25] <raj> xp_prg2, yep, but my answer would be probably for jstree too :)
[20:34:33] <raj> I just used it for cut and dry stuff
[20:34:49] <raj> (and still wasn't happy about the docs)
[20:35:40] <raj> systemfault, who is there hakim guy

[20:56:20] <systemfault> RAJ, Y U DO DRUGS?
[20:59:30] <Cogito> hi jquery, I'm investigating an issue with a framework called meteor which is using jQuery. It is having issues registering bind events, however most other events seem to be working fine. The bug report I have raised to track this (for meteor) is at https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/127
[20:59:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #127 on meteor (Cogito; 3m, 4s ago): Attaching a blur event to a template does not work
[20:59:45] <Cogito> any ideas about what could be causing this?
[21:00:34] <coldhead> props for filing the issue, babe
[21:01:00] <ajpiano> Cogito: meteor definitely should not be using $.event.add
[21:01:09] <Cogito> ajpiano: that is what I thought as well
[21:01:17] <Cogito> but I'm not sure what the context is
[21:02:09] <Cogito> off the top of your head, do you know what should be used instead?
[21:02:10] <coldhead> i don't get why it would be sensitive to the event type
[21:02:41] <Cogito> coldhead: the only idea I had was that blur has the alternative focusout
[21:02:54] <Cogito> and maybe that is handled somewhere else or something
[21:03:09] <coldhead> gross
[21:03:23] <coldhead> hell of a thing to have to debug
[21:03:27] <Cogito> yeah
[21:03:41] <ajpiano> coldhead: $(elt).on("event", function(e) { }) ? make
[21:03:43] <ajpiano> maybe
[21:03:44] <coldhead> did you try #meteor?
[21:03:59] <Cogito> coldhead: yeah, the devs are quiet there at the moment
[21:04:11] <Cogito> been discussing it over there for a while now
[21:04:12] <coldhead> oh so you decided to make it jQuery's problem
[21:04:21] <coldhead> :D
[21:04:22] <ajpiano> yea it's like, anywhere from the middle of the night in europe to nighttime on the westcoast
[21:04:30] <ajpiano> soo
[21:04:34] <Cogito> haha no, I reduced the issue down to a jQuery call :P
[21:05:43] <Cogito> my suspicion is that either the call is incorrect (or unsupported because it is not part of the public API etc) or there is a jQuery bug
[21:06:19] <ajpiano> taht's what i'm saying
[21:06:24] <ajpiano> it's not part of the public API
[21:06:28] <Cogito> yep
[21:06:48] <NaN> why I can't make an event (click) after I compile a handlebars template?
[21:07:09] <Cogito> so I am happy to write a patch for meteor to avoid using $.event.add, however it seems odd that it breaks on 'blur' events
[21:07:19] <Cogito> and nothing else
[21:07:29] <Cogito> could be symptomatic of a deeper issue
[21:07:37] <ajpiano> Cogito: could try focusout instead of blur
[21:07:43] <Cogito> focusout works fine
[21:07:44] <systemfault> blur and focus don't bubble, it could be that
[21:07:47] <coldhead> a maze of twisty passages all alike
[21:07:54] <coldhead> oh swish systemfault
[21:08:17] <Cogito> so if it was the bubbling, we would expect focus to not work either
[21:08:23] <Cogito> let me test that quick
[21:09:45] <Cogito> confirmed, focus doesn't register correctly either
[21:09:53] <raj> what's this license mean? I have to present this license if I use this code?
[21:10:07] <raj> https://github.com/hakimel/stroll.js/blob/master/LICENSE
[21:11:17] <systemfault> raj: It looks like the traditional MIT license.
[21:11:41] <raj> but it's copyrighted
[21:12:04] <systemfault> No?
[21:12:37] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
[21:12:41] <Cogito> anyone have issues if I reproduce this conversation on the bug report?
[21:12:42] <coldhead> CHECK YOURSELF
[21:12:46] <coldhead> BEFORE ETC
[21:13:04] <coldhead> Cogito: probably better to summarise it
[21:13:16] <Cogito> coldhead: no worries :)
[21:13:45] <ajpiano> paraphrase it as "the jQuery Team says never to use undocumented interfaces in your framework, not matter how world changing it is"
[21:13:46] <ajpiano> :p
[21:14:07] <raj> right, but I don't think mit license comes with a Copyright claim too
[21:15:08] <coldhead> you think wrong, it does, case closed
[21:15:31] <coldhead> you have to claim the copyright before you can vary the distribution/reuse conditions
[21:15:34] <coldhead> it's no big deak
[21:15:38] <coldhead> deal*
[21:16:10] <systemfault> Anyway.. BSD variants are fair
[21:16:19] <raj> k
[21:16:48] <systemfault> They're usually.. "Do whatever you want with the code… but don't be an asshole and give credit where it's due"
[21:17:48] <raj> so I have to post his copyright claim somewhere?
[21:17:53] <raj> on my website or whatever
[21:20:33] <coldhead> you just have to include it with the code
[21:20:49] <coldhead> basically you're free to use it just don't claim you wrote it
[21:20:55] <coldhead> and no lawyers will come calling
[21:21:16] <raj> right, so I'm saying, if I use that .js file, I need to have that license on display somewhere as well?
[21:21:23] <raj> or only if I distribute his code?

[21:22:18] <raj> how do you include it without having a link to it on your website
[21:22:38] <coldhead> i think this licence is too complicated for you, raj
[21:22:41] <raj> i mean, I don't have a jquery license link on my site either
[21:22:44] <coldhead> you need to use wtfpl
[21:23:00] <NaN> any help to make the "click me" button to work? > http://jsfiddle.net/cmkhQ/
[21:23:03] <coldhead> ?wtfpl
[21:23:07] <bot-t> coldhead, plugins.jquery.com - http://plugins.jquery.com/WTFPL - http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/

[21:24:41] <raj> NaN, http://jsfiddle.net/cmkhQ/2/
[21:25:40] <NaN> raj: doesn't work :(
[21:25:40] <raj> NaN, nm, i see what you wanted to do
[21:25:41] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/cmkhQ/3/
[21:26:19] <NaN> raj: yep that works
[21:26:40] <NaN> then I need to make a "global" event?
[21:27:33] <flaggy> just realised I'm too sexy for my PC! Bye
[21:28:02] <raj> NaN, doesn't have to be global, just has to be on the container
[21:28:36] <raj> coldhead, I don't see other sites that use jquery show the jquery license either
[21:29:24] <Cogito> thanks for your help everyone, going to try and rewrite the event calls using .on()
[21:29:29] <Cogito> we'll see how it goes :)
[21:30:04] <systemfault> .on is sexy.
[21:30:13] <raj> +1
[21:33:30] <luvmyh0nda> Hi, I am trying to implement 2 separate accordions on one page. The left-half of the page is loaded at a different time than the right-half of the page. Both accordions are present, but when I click a tab on the second-loaded (right-half) accordion, the left accordion closes as well... any ideas?
[21:34:35] <Bankzilla> you're probably using the same classes on both accordings
[21:34:48] <luvmyh0nda> classes or IDs?
[21:34:59] <Bankzilla> what ever you're using to target it
[21:35:10] <luvmyh0nda> ID, and they're both separate
[21:35:47] <luvmyh0nda> using random MD5s to identify them, with different prefixes
[21:36:00] <luvmyh0nda> eg. clientright-md5 & configuredclients-md5
[21:36:46] <Bankzilla> would have to be something repeating to make the other one close
[21:40:43] <beancurd> SHOW US YER CODE
[21:40:49] <beancurd> WOOOO
[21:41:42] * ngharo throws beads
[22:25:29] <raj> why in the world does jquery-ui have !important in its native css?
[22:32:29] <rhizmoe> is there a list of event types?
[22:39:20] <rhizmoe> is it just these: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/ ? seems odd to be able to do .delegate('bind',....) or whatever
[22:43:00] <freemind> hi, when using .html() in forms, the formdata is not included. how to get the html with input data?
[22:48:54] <rhizmoe> freemind: .serialize, i think
[22:49:50] <freemind> rhizmoe, but I need the raw html with input data :( not just the values
[22:50:25] <freemind> rhizmoe, I've read on google about innerHTML bug in gecko browsers, IE is updating innerHTML, but gecko browsers dont
[22:50:41] <freemind> thats why html() isnt working
[22:56:14] <raj> how can I freeze the page so I can click on an element while i hover it, so I can assess it's css in devel tools
[22:56:17] <raj> ?
[22:57:39] <systemfault> raj: You use the chrome dev tools?
[22:57:44] <raj> yes
[22:58:18] <systemfault> In the right panel of the "Elements" tab, at the right of the "Styles" word
[22:58:32] <systemfault> The second icon is some dotted rectange with a cursor
[22:58:47] <systemfault> Click on it then you can toggle states.
[22:59:50] <systemfault> Got it?
[23:10:20] <rhizmoe> freemind: ah, no idea. sorry
[23:43:46] <Whirl3d> What can go wrong when trying to get the height of a div. It's not hidden, but it keeps returning just the height of the header (which is the only height actually declared..the rest is dynamic)...so how do I get the dynamic height of a div?
[23:54:47] <ndss56> Whirl3d: Interesting question. I suppose #css would know the answer to that one.
[23:55:53] <coldhead> Whirl3d: if you inspect the element with your debugger you can get the highlight to show you where the actual borders of the element are
[23:56:03] <coldhead> also border: 1px solid #0f0
[23:56:17] <coldhead> its usually because the container is not floated and a child is
[23:56:35] <Krisbhagwat> I am using PostMessage jQuery scripts.. is there any limitation on the message length ? Max length?
[23:57:06] <onats> is it possible to submit a form using jquery?
[23:59:10] <Whirl3d> easier solution using jquery: Simply set the elements opactiy to 0, it's overflow to "scroll" and it's height will be the scrollheight of the element. THen return it's overflow to hidden and you are good to go.
[23:59:23] <Whirl3d> ndss56, nice try.
[23:59:40] <coldhead> you call that easy?!
