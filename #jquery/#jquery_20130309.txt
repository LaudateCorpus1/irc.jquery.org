[00:02:04] <clu3> solarflares, i can, but setting positions of highlighted div to 'relative' might break the page's layout
[00:02:16] <solarflares> then fix it
[00:02:40] <clu3> solarflares, so it sounds like setting the position to relative is the only solution ?
[00:02:50] <solarflares> you can position it absolutely
[00:02:52] <solarflares> as well
[00:03:20] <solarflares> and fixed i guess
[00:04:13] <clu3> okay thanks, i see.
[00:04:20] <solarflares> if you look at the z-index page on MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/z-index
[00:04:30] <solarflares> you will see that it only applies to positioned elements
[00:06:34] <clu3> oh, that's cool, i didn't know that. So that has just 'destroyed' my idea. I wanna apply this plugin to any current page, website to offer live help (Like what the boxes are on the page, normally for first time visitors of the site)
[00:13:38] <solarflares> many more ideas will get destroyed in the future while you're learning, its a process, but dont give up!
[00:16:29] <solarflares> hmm it seems i should start using underscore
[00:21:48] <boytoy> I'm using jQuery Mobile for the first time and I see it's added a ton of ui-* classes all over my HTML. Is there any way to prevent that other than adding data-enhance="false" to every single element?
[00:22:14] <coldhead> hahaha
[00:22:55] <coldhead> if you don't want those classes you probably don't want ui
[00:23:17] <boytoy> Oooh so it shipped automatically with jQuery Mobile?
[00:23:51] <coldhead> it's all of a package
[00:24:03] <coldhead> all that stuff is the magic that jqm brings you
[00:25:16] <boytoy> i see i see
[00:28:00] <solarflares> whats a krinkle
[00:29:46] <Krinkle> solarflares: I'll tell you what it isn't. It isn't a phenomenon known to cause wormholes to divert into space time sending SG1 to the 60s.
[00:29:53] <Krinkle> cause that's a solar flare.
[00:30:58] <Krinkle> it's a made up name derived from something that's derived from something that' derived from my last name.
[00:31:27] <Krinkle> later it turns out there's a company producing chips in "Krinkle" style, and that a fictional character Chris Kringle sounds like Krinkle.
[00:31:50] <Krinkle> and there's a punk band with a song The Krinkle
[00:31:52] <Krinkle> all unrelated.
[00:32:02] <Krinkle> and a guy's blog (krinkle.net) also not me.
[00:32:09] <Krinkle> I'm the original :)
[00:32:18] <Krinkle> anyway, auto-join to the rescue
[00:32:19] <Krinkle> cua ltr
[00:36:55] <djQuery> boytoy, data-role="none"
[00:37:24] <djQuery> boytoy, to keep it from inhancing individual elements
[00:38:01] <boytoy> oh like that, cool cool
[00:38:17] <boytoy> was just at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8648596/how-to-use-jquery-mobile-for-its-touch-event-support-only-no-ui-enhancements considering switching over to jgestures
[00:39:07] <boytoy> glad it didnt have to come to that
[00:41:59] <boytoy> djQuery: i kinda need data-role="page" and data-role="panel" though :/
[00:55:04] <djQuery> boytoy, could just leave out the css file
[01:03:29] <boytoy> Was just able to build my own blend over at http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ and now jQuery Mobile no longer injects its own UI classes into my HTML. Yay!
[01:14:19] <amirite> poop
[01:27:03] <rogd> how to make comboboxc select list with autocomplete ahah?
[01:30:11] <sCoRpi> rogd: what have you tried?
[01:31:58] <rogd> google, im making a drupal widget
[01:32:36] <rogd> i defeintly need a keyed list i can get from the server
[01:35:58] <niels__> is it looked upon as bad practice using onmouseover="" directly?
[01:37:09] <boytoy> At http://bit.ly/Y4Z7BZ -- can anybody spot why my jQuery Mobile panel won't launch?
[01:40:23] <boytoy> Ah, again those .ui-* classes
[01:46:18] <MrFox> hi guys! how do i make those animated viewport jumps onto a particular part of my page? are there any plugins for doing this?
[01:56:55] <superdo> hi
[01:57:10] <superdo> anyone have problem fitvids js and jquery mobile?
[02:10:30] <pats_Toms> hi, about this... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[02:10:46] <pats_Toms> I am trying to make something like jquery plugin
[02:10:58] <pats_Toms> about last code snippet
[02:11:15] <pats_Toms> is there any way to method use own method?
[02:11:32] <pats_Toms> like use show() in init() and so on
[02:21:04] <ravenzz> pats_Toms if you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/9HBw5/ yes
[02:23:15] <pats_Toms> yeah, I got it working as you writed there
[02:23:41] <pats_Toms> thanks ravenzz
[02:24:07] <ravenzz> anyway those methos would be "public"
[02:24:19] <ravenzz> I mean any method of "methods"
[02:24:56] <pats_Toms> public?
[02:25:20] <pats_Toms> oh, I got it
[02:25:37] <ravenzz> so if your show() (which can be anything else) method is not meant to be public, you've got to do this in a different way
[02:26:25] <pats_Toms> so, any good example?
[02:26:25] <ravenzz> yeah any method of "method" can be invoked: yourplugin("method");
[02:27:15] <pats_Toms> hmm, something is not like you write
[02:27:20] <pats_Toms> I can't do that
[02:27:21] <ravenzz> that's more about js and its patterns, in this case the module pattern could be what are you looking for
[02:27:38] <ravenzz> mmm what exactly?
[02:29:31] <pats_Toms> no, it's true
[02:29:40] <pats_Toms> They are ultra public
[02:30:32] <pats_Toms> so, maybe I just need to write other var with functions
[02:30:35] <pats_Toms> and use from it
[02:32:12] <ravenzz> have a look at the module pattern
[02:33:14] <ravenzz> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript
[02:34:49] <pats_Toms> seems like there is the same author
[02:34:50] <pats_Toms> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/
[02:43:02] <pats_Toms> seems like really good article, I will read it all
[02:44:08] <djQuery> pats_Toms, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Cbu4E/
[02:44:43] <pats_Toms> plugin generator?
[02:45:09] <djQuery> pats_Toms, gets all your methods privates and options atleast
[02:45:25] <djQuery> still up to you to actualy write the code
[02:45:50] <pats_Toms> omg, looks epic
[02:45:56] <pats_Toms> nice work
[02:46:07] <djQuery> pats_Toms, didn't write it and I think it needs some work
[02:46:19] <djQuery> pats_Toms, like I think it does the options wrong
[02:46:38] <djQuery> pats_Toms, at least it does the defaults wrong
[02:49:22] <djQuery> the defaults should be defined as  $.fn.pluginName.defaults     this way they can be changed globaly instead of each time you $('elem').pluginName({option: value}}
[03:13:11] <boytoy> anybody here moved away from jquery mobile?
[03:13:34] <pats_Toms> djQuery, yeah, Addy Osmani writed about that too
[03:13:36] <boytoy> to say https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js or something.. curious about y'all input
[03:14:27] <boytoy> was reading http://codemint.net/stop-using-jquery-mobile/ and http://blog.siami.fr/articles/why-i-hate-jquery-mobile ... not good :(
[03:18:21] <pats_Toms> jquery have interesnting style guidelines
[03:18:27] <pats_Toms> "object[ array[ 0 ] ];"
[03:18:34] <pats_Toms> why that spaces?
[03:41:59] <der_On> hi. is it possible to use a selector that has multiple attribute conditions? like .some-class[data-a="value1",data-b="value2"]
[03:43:49] <nail_> der_On: [foo="bar"][baz="quux"]
[03:44:01] <der_On> thank you very much
[03:44:06] <der_On> that's what i was looking for
[03:44:38] <nail_> welcome :)

[04:42:48] <motaka2> but when I click on breadcrumbs - It suddenly changes the url
[04:42:57] <motaka2> What do u suggest me to do ?
[04:45:14] <gener1c> no idea motaka2 i am still learning mobile , just started yesterday and now i have to stop due to other projects :/
[04:45:32] <gener1c> all i know is gestures and if i find out a way to use them without jq mobile ill do it gladly

[05:34:57] <Braden`> Anyone here familiar with the twitter api?
[05:35:08] <Braden`> I am connecting to it using jquery ajax
[05:35:14] <AskMP> Which one?
[05:35:41] <Braden`> oauth
[05:36:02] <AskMP> I deal mainly with GET requests but may be able to hlp.
[05:36:06] <AskMP> what's the question?
[05:36:59] <Braden`> Its the GET request I am having trouble with
[05:37:28] <Braden`> Its wanting an oauth_token as a parm.  I don't have anything to supply it.  I have my consumer key and consumer secret
[05:37:52] <AskMP> what type of action are you trying to perform?
[05:38:25] <Braden`> login
[05:39:07] <AskMP> Twitter is switching to their Oauth2 and recommends you use their updated version.
[05:39:17] <AskMP> This is one of the reasons that they are discontinuing Tweetdeck
[05:39:38] <Braden`> I am not sure which I am using
[05:39:49] <Braden`> I reckon probably 1.1
[05:39:55] <AskMP> Probably
[05:40:17] <Braden`> What am I supposed to pass for oath_token?
[05:40:20] <AskMP> If you're performing anything but a search of the Twitter content, you will likely be needing to update.
[05:40:49] <AskMP> You need to generate one for your session for the user.
[05:41:50] <AskMP> Are you using PHP for your web platform and jQuery locally?
[05:43:00] <AskMP> https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-libraries
[05:48:34] <Braden`> AskMP:  Thank you for the link.  I need to take a break though.  Right now I am using twitteroauth by abraham

[06:33:26] <anew> but my overlay points to another url
[06:33:34] <anew> anyone have any ideas on how i can do this ?
[06:34:39] <defaultro> hey folks, I'm using $.ajax to submit post to a php. My php returns json. What will be the function to decode the value? I'm getting an error in jquery.parseJSON(response); Jquery is not defined.

[06:41:06] <anew> so anyone have any ideas how to use an overlay with recapcha?

[06:45:35] <StephenS> defaultro, seems like all is good http://jsfiddle.net/N8553/
[06:45:45] <StephenS> However beware that you need to put script after dom is loaded
[06:46:04] <defaultro> i fixed it. wrong spelling, lol
[06:46:24] <systemfault> ...
[06:46:50] <systemfault> The kind of errors your javascript console should have detected.
[06:47:07] <StephenS> defaultro, also http://jsfiddle.net/N8553/1/
[06:47:11] <defaultro> k
[06:47:33] <defaultro> nice
[06:47:35] <defaultro> cleaner
[06:47:35] <systemfault> $(function() {}) is sexier than $(document).ready(function() {})
[06:57:37] <StephenS> whatever it fits for him

[07:45:55] <recurse> any of you guys run into issues with jquery tabs() (from their UI) and 1.9?
[07:46:16] <motka> lord4163 - and what's the issue?
[07:46:25] <recurse> im trying to put the panel content into a remote div on click of tab ... it just seems to append new divs whereever it wants
[07:46:50] <lord4163> motka: the styles do not appear
[07:46:58] <lord4163> I mean my own styles
[07:47:28] <motka> post your whole code
[07:47:29] <recurse> ive scoured over their api docs and tried several techniques, all to no avail.  panel content shows direct beneath tabs no matter the call back methods i use
[07:47:42] <motka> I belive that you have this "<div id="dialog">" set in your <head> tag
[07:49:11] <recurse> heres my latest rendition http://pastebin.com/QEh0eC8p
[07:49:24] <StephenS> motka, dobar nick :D
[07:50:49] <anew> oh shit
[07:50:52] <anew> look who it is
[07:50:52] <anew> lol
[07:50:53] <recurse> oh shit
[07:50:56] <recurse> look who it is
[07:51:00] <recurse> lol
[07:51:01] <anew> lmao
[07:51:04] <recurse> are you following me?
[07:51:08] <recurse> =)~
[07:51:12] <anew> quite possibly
[07:51:12] <recurse> whats good?
[07:51:18] <recurse> i came for some jquery help myself
[07:51:28] <anew> not much.. me also, but might have to use a new jq plugin
[07:51:34] <anew> what is ur issue ?
[07:51:59] <recurse> finding it baffleing that the tabs() function requires surgery to put the content into your desired div
[07:52:07] <recurse> if its even possible
[07:52:45] <recurse> also find it freustrating that theyve made quite a number of changes in jquery 1.9 including finally removing old deprecated functions with no real replacements yet
[07:53:04] <recurse> or replacements that where as user friendly as the previous methods
[07:53:08] <lord4163> motka: it must be in my head?
[07:53:38] <recurse> so whats your issues anew?
[07:53:55] <anew> actually i think i just solved mine
[07:53:59] <anew> was a recaptcha problem
[07:54:15] <anew> recurse with jq 1.9 you have to use the supplement
[07:54:21] <anew> or whatever the hll it's called let me see
[07:54:43] <recurse> for backward compatibility, yes ive read up on that migration junk
[07:54:54] <recurse> im ok with using new methods
[07:54:57] <anew> oh ok
[07:55:05] <anew> well that solved a lot of issues with me when they moved upto 10.9
[07:55:14] <recurse> but atleast provide me with feasable means and well documented examples to follow =(
[07:55:14] <anew> they deprecated a lot of things i ws using
[07:55:24] <recurse> yea
[07:55:25] <recurse> cunts
[07:55:28] <recurse> =)
[07:55:29] <anew> yeah
[07:55:31] <anew> lol
[07:55:41] <anew> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.1.0.js
[07:55:42] <anew> there
[07:55:46] <anew> do u have that in ur page
[07:55:56] <recurse> no should i?
[07:56:06] <motka> lord4163 - it must be in the body
[07:56:10] <recurse> dats allotta lines'a
[07:56:13] <anew> if ur using 1.9 and getting some weird errors in console
[07:56:26] <anew> there's a mininfied version also
[07:56:45] <anew> i mean u just include it right after jq
[07:56:48] <recurse> thats what she said
[07:56:55] <anew> lol
[08:00:16] <lord4163> no else it will show up in other browsers
[08:00:24] <motka> what??
[08:01:55] <recurse> jquery tabs() suck
[08:01:55] <lord4163> the dialog
[08:04:46] <lord4163> It just have to show up in IE 8 or lower
[08:05:04] <motka> who else uses IE 8 or lower?
[08:05:07] <motka> post your whole code
[08:06:48] <recurse> anybody using windows XP still is stuck on IE8
[08:06:51] <recurse> so plenty
[08:06:57] <recurse> including myself
[08:06:58] <kristofers> Is there any alternative to scrolling the body of an iframe, when hovering a button, the iframe being of an external URL
[08:07:38] <kristofers> i know there's some cross domain problem but there has to be a way around
[08:07:52] <recurse> kristofers: get the height of the content and dynamically set the iframe height accordingly
[08:07:53] <lord4163> motka: I'm making a dialog for IE8 users to let them download Firefox :D
[08:08:57] <lord4163> motka: http://pastebin.com/JzJzpRW9
[08:09:24] <recurse> so kristofers you could load() the external url into a display:none div, then get the height of said div then load both the content of this div into your iframe AND set its height appropriately
[08:12:34] <SebaUy> I have the following problem: i want to trigger an event when an image is clicked/touched and and another event when the click/touch is released. The click event is ok but when i click inside the image and then i release the click outside it i want to do the same as when i release the click inside the image.
[08:14:22] <lord4163> motka: ? :P
[08:15:13] <motka> YOU CANNOT PUT div UNDER HEAD DOG!
[08:15:28] <motka> you move that code above the body
[08:15:33] <motka> below, sorry
[08:15:39] <motka> below the <body> statement
[08:15:46] <gener1c> eh
[08:16:15] <SebaUy> I thought of adding the click release event in the whole document but there may be a better solution
[08:16:20] <motka> only: link, style, meta, script, title, are allowed in the <head> tag
[08:17:59] <lord4163> motka: I know, but the if statement won't work there right?
[08:18:58] <SebaUy> anyone?
[08:19:08] <motka> what?
[08:19:14] <motka> are you taking a piss?
[08:19:23] <SebaUy> read my question above :)
[08:21:05] <StephenS> motka no reply?
[08:23:51] <SebaUy> I want to detect the mouseup event of an element when the drag started inside it
[08:24:32] <lord4163> motka: it still doesn't work
[08:28:09] <motka> SebaUy - i wasnt making conversation with you
[08:28:15] <motka> StephenS
[08:28:23] <lord4163> gotta eat
[08:28:30] <SebaUy> ah ok
[08:28:32] <StephenS> motka, ne javljas se

[08:46:07] <xec_> oops sorry
[08:46:12] <xec_> SebaUy ^^
[08:47:06] <guesswho> man i'm struggling here ...  i cannot find any jq overlay that will work with recaptcha
[08:47:11] <guesswho> anyone can help !?
[08:47:52] <johnkpaul> guesswho: what is wrong with the ones you have tried?
[08:48:25] <guesswho> i've tried facebox and lightbox... at this point i will use anything that will work.  the ajax will just not make the recaptcha appear inside the overlay
[08:48:48] <guesswho> let me see if i can show u what i have so far
[08:49:35] <johnkpaul> guesswho: you're calling Recaptcha.create _after_ the modal is dispalyed, right?
[08:49:51] <guesswho> modal = ?
[08:50:04] <guesswho> i have my facebox on a new page, so it is pointing to /category/display
[08:50:04] <johnkpaul> "overlay"
[08:50:14] <guesswho> hmm i have recaptcha.create in my header
[08:50:24] <johnkpaul> guesswho: ah, that's why
[08:50:28] <guesswho> where do i put it ?
[08:50:35] <johnkpaul> you need to move that into the callback of the lightbox
[08:50:59] <guesswho> callback of the lightbox so ... $('a[rel*=facebox]').facebox();
[08:51:00] <guesswho> inside here ?
[08:51:37] <guesswho> brb bathroom... i cant hold it.  even though this is the most help i've gotten in 3 hours! i hope ur still here in 5 min
[08:51:59] <johnkpaul> guesswho: the last example is the one you want
[08:52:01] <johnkpaul> http://defunkt.io/facebox/
[08:52:20] <johnkpaul> after the 3rd line, inside the .get() callback, you need to add your recpatcha stuff
[08:56:36] <roowilliams> hello, if i am writing from a form to a db via jquery ajax, if i want to display the value submitted into the form instantly in the page should i do it via a callback get function on success: or is there some other way?
[09:03:05] <guesswho> johnkpaul still there? awesome, let me try that real quick then
[09:03:51] <guesswho> last example ?
[09:03:53] <guesswho>  which one ?
[09:04:29] <johnkpaul> guesswho: jQuery.facebox(function(){})
[09:05:38] <guesswho> http://jsfiddle.net/g9NcZ/1/
[09:05:39] <guesswho> like this ?
[09:06:36] <guesswho> what is code.js there ?
[09:07:23] <johnkpaul> guesswho: code.js is url of whatever ajax call you're making to update the facebox
[09:08:02] <guesswho> ah right get
[09:08:37] <guesswho> hmmm ok one more question
[09:08:54] <guesswho> jQuery.facebox is this called on page load if i insert it into document.load ?
[09:10:00] <guesswho> wait so code.js = recaptcha.create ?
[09:10:33] <guesswho> $('a[rel*=facebox]').facebox();
[09:10:38] <guesswho> i dont understand how this one line i had before
[09:10:44] <guesswho> would morph into that other function
[09:11:00] <guesswho> does a[rel*=facebox] not exist anymore ?
[09:13:59] <guesswho> i mean with recaptcha.create there is no url, i gues put it in an external js file
[09:17:49] <StephenS> one Q
[09:18:04] <StephenS> Why on reload one dom is automatically showed and then hidenn as is supposed to be ?
[09:18:30] <johnkpaul> guesswho: did you read the whole documentation for facebox?
[09:18:41] <johnkpaul> when you use the last example, you don't use the relfacebox anymore
[09:18:51] <guesswho> http://jsfiddle.net/g9NcZ/2/
[09:18:53] <guesswho> so far i have this
[09:19:11] <guesswho> but without relfacebox how do i get it to bind to an element ?
[09:19:19] <johnkpaul> guesswho: .click()
[09:19:23] <johnkpaul> .on('click', handler)
[09:19:29] <johnkpaul> guesswho: but there's other problems with that
[09:19:34] <guesswho> ..
[09:19:35] <johnkpaul> guesswho: why is your url, recaptcha?
[09:19:40] <guesswho> the two periods i just saw it
[09:20:00] <guesswho> i just created that recaptcha.js file, inside it i put the recaptcha.create function
[09:20:11] <johnkpaul> guesswho: hm, that's not what $.get is doing
[09:20:19] <johnkpaul> I thought you said that you were using facebox ajax
[09:20:38] <guesswho> i'm using Recaptcha.create
[09:20:40] <guesswho> from google docs
[09:20:46] <guesswho> it says all you need is that for an ajax call
[09:21:09] <johnkpaul> recaptcha.create itself is an ajax call, facebox has nothing to do with it
[09:21:11] <johnkpaul> ?demo @guesswho
[09:21:12] <bot-t> guesswho, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:21:15] <b-ot> guesswho: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:21:34] <guesswho> ok will put everything i have so far into jsfiddle
[09:21:45] <guesswho> oh hmmm
[09:21:47] <johnkpaul> guesswho: :) you just have to make it work
[09:21:50] <johnkpaul> not copy paste everything
[09:21:56] <guesswho> so i cant use recaptcha.create with facebox then ?
[09:22:00] <johnkpaul> guesswho: from your description, and your fiddle, I can't tell what your problem is
[09:22:04] <johnkpaul> guesswho: you can, facebook doesn't care what's in it
[09:22:28] <guesswho> damn so lost now... will put my code in jsfiddle
[09:23:51] <korilo> is it possible to use jquery with angularjs?
[09:24:00] <johnkpaul> korilo: yes
[09:24:21] <korilo> mmbecouse i want things like flexislider, page scrolling and animate effects
[09:24:33] <johnkpaul> korilo: read the 10th question or so
[09:24:33] <johnkpaul> http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq
[09:25:03] <korilo> do i just include jquery with my own function and plugins? will angular and jquery cohexists?
[09:25:16] <johnkpaul> korilo: did you read that faq?
[09:25:45] <korilo> yup that's fine
[09:25:56] <guesswho> http://jsfiddle.net/g9NcZ/4/
[09:26:02] <korilo> so i can use angular for somthing and jquery for other
[09:26:11] <guesswho> johnkpaul the top html points to a form on another page
[09:26:18] <guesswho> i didnt know how to include that, so i just pasted it below
[09:26:25] <johnkpaul> korilo: that doesn't make sense
[09:26:38] <johnkpaul> korilo: jquery is an optional dependency of angular
[09:26:39] <korilo> but i think i can be able to wrap jquery function/effect in angular event or something
[09:26:43] <johnkpaul> but they are otherwise orthoganal
[09:26:58] <johnkpaul> korilo: :) you're saying exactly what that faq says
[09:27:06] <korilo> mmm lol
[09:27:14] <korilo> i should find some example code to see
[09:27:27] <johnkpaul> guesswho: hm, I am still confused
[09:27:31] <korilo> like an $.ready animate or somthing
[09:27:32] <johnkpaul> that js is what you have now?
[09:27:35] <guesswho> me too lol
[09:27:39] <guesswho> yes
[09:27:45] <guesswho> before i only had that one relfacebox line
[09:27:53] <johnkpaul> guesswho: and that works, but just doesn't show the recpatcha?
[09:27:56] <guesswho> and the popup worked, but recaptcha didnt just display
[09:28:03] <guesswho> well what i have here doesnt work at all
[09:28:06] <johnkpaul> korilo: if you include jQuery, angular will use jQuery and not it's internal jquery lite
[09:28:14] <johnkpaul> guesswho: can you make it work
[09:28:15] <johnkpaul> as it used to
[09:28:19] <guesswho> sure
[09:28:21] <Seba1989> I have an image, when i click on the image the mouseup event is triggered, if i click on the image and release the click outside it, i want the mouseup event to be triggered too. How can i do that?
[09:29:08] <johnkpaul> ?mouseout @Seba1989
[09:29:08] <bot-t> Seba1989, .mouseout(handler): Bind an event handler to the "mouseout" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseout/
[09:29:17] <tbranyen> i can't seem to find a decent column dragging plugin :-/
[09:29:25] <tbranyen> johnkpaul: btw i got your email, gonna deal with it on the bus ride up to NH later
[09:29:45] <johnkpaul> tbranyen: great, thanks
[09:29:55] <guesswho> http://jsfiddle.net/kegq7/
[09:30:01] <guesswho> johnkpaul this is all i had before
[09:30:09] <guesswho> and when you click you see the href in the html
[09:30:17] <guesswho> that would point to a page that contained a form
[09:30:32] <guesswho> so the popup would essentially be the other page
[09:30:52] <johnkpaul> guesswho: that's the part I'm confused about
[09:30:57] <Seba1989> johnkpaul, yes but i want the mouse out to be triggered after the mouseclick
[09:30:57] <johnkpaul> so that's _not_ working in this example?
[09:31:10] <johnkpaul> Seba1989: so you want a drag?
[09:31:17] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery ui draggable @ Seba1989
[09:31:17] <b-ot> Seba1989: Sorry, no results for ‟jquery ui draggable @ Seba1989”.
[09:31:19] <bot-t> Seba1989, Draggable | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[09:31:38] <Seba1989> mm, lets see
[09:31:43] <guesswho> well everything is working except the recapt.  here is what i tried first) i put the php of the recapt inside the form - it didnt show
[09:32:03] <guesswho> second) i put recaptcha.create on this page with an empty div inside the form
[09:32:06] <guesswho> that didnt show either
[09:32:08] <guesswho> so now here i am
[09:32:42] <guesswho> does that make any sense
[09:32:50] <guesswho> i can copy/paste my form if you want
[09:35:41] <johnkpaul> guesswho: you need to attach an event handler to the "reveal.facebox" event that is bound to dhe document
[09:35:44] <Seba1989> I have an image which works like a button, when the user clicks/touches an animation like a button beoing pressed is done (this is with the vmousedown event), and when the user releases the click/touch the image changes its original form as if the button was selected. The problem is that when the user touches a button and while touching it the user moves the finger to another place (moves the
[09:35:45] <Seba1989> cursor while still holding the click) i want an event that leaves the image in its original state as if it was never touched.
[09:36:03] <johnkpaul> guesswho: look at line 65 of https://github.com/defunkt/facebox/blob/master/src/facebox.js
[09:36:20] <guesswho> argh so difficult... i need to find another way to do this
[09:36:30] <guesswho> been on this 3 hours already, this will take me a week
[09:36:38] <johnkpaul> guesswho: :) it's only difficult because you havent' experienced it before
[09:36:52] <guesswho> editing plugins usually = disaster for me
[09:36:54] <johnkpaul> adding a captcha to a modal is something that you'll never find difficult again after you solve this
[09:36:57] <johnkpaul> guesswho: I didn't say edit a plugin
[09:37:06] <guesswho> isnt this the source of facebox.js
[09:37:08] <johnkpaul> guesswho: the plugin gives you a hook
[09:37:11] <johnkpaul> guesswho: lol yes it is
[09:37:15] <johnkpaul> I told you to _read_ it
[09:37:16] <johnkpaul> not to change it
[09:37:20] <johnkpaul> look at like 65
[09:37:39] <guesswho> oh
[09:38:07] <guesswho> head explode
[09:38:07] <Seba1989> johnkpaul
[09:38:16] <guesswho> so where do i put .click() ?
[09:38:33] <johnkpaul> guesswho: who said anything about click?
[09:38:41] <guesswho> :/ to show my facebox :(
[09:38:46] <guesswho> u said i needed click
[09:38:52] <johnkpaul> I was wrong, line 65 is the way to go
[09:39:04] <johnkpaul> I didn't realize flexbox gives you the option
[09:39:06] <johnkpaul> facebox*
[09:39:16] <guesswho> but with this line how do i attacth it do #div
[09:39:23] <guesswho> or rather an external url
[09:39:25] <dblosevn> hey anybody know of a way to instruct chrome to not ask if you want to translate a page? it breaks my layout when that toolbar pops up at the top of the page
[09:39:35] <johnkpaul> guesswho: what is "it"?
[09:39:57] <guesswho> sorry, so i have a url and when a user clicks the url an external page appears
[09:40:05] <guesswho> how do i attach facebox to the href
[09:40:23] <johnkpaul> dblosevn: I don't think that the html author can change that, you can write an extension though
[09:40:31] <johnkpaul> Seba1989: I think you'll need to do that manually
[09:40:40] <johnkpaul> keep track of where the user's mouse is yourself
[09:40:45] <johnkpaul> there's nothing that exactly matches that case
[09:40:53] <johnkpaul> guesswho: but I thought your jsfiddle was the example you wnted
[09:40:56] <dblosevn> was wondering if there was maybe a meta header or something similar to how you can prevent autofilling
[09:40:58] <johnkpaul> that _doesn't_ have any external ajax url
[09:41:14] <guesswho> johnkpaul it is
[09:41:15] <johnkpaul> dblosevn: ah, you're rithg <meta name="google" value="notranslate" />
[09:41:23] <guesswho> well i need to call the google ajax tho somehow
[09:41:28] <guesswho> want to kill myself
[09:41:43] <guesswho> how do i call recaptcha.create in all this
[09:41:44] <johnkpaul> guesswho: that script tag can be added in your header
[09:41:46] <motka> guesswho - buy a gun or go to the legion
[09:41:49] <johnkpaul> you just have to call recpatcha.create in your callback
[09:41:54] <johnkpaul> guesswho: what is your background?
[09:42:03] <johnkpaul> I'm assuming not browser guy?
[09:42:06] <guesswho> dont have a background
[09:42:09] <dblosevn> sweet, ya its only an issue in the admin panel and if they select german for instance they definitely dont want the page translated to english lol
[09:42:10] <johnkpaul> these frustrations are realy common
[09:42:15] <johnkpaul> guesswho: I mean in terms of programming
[09:42:23] <guesswho> yeah i dont have a programming background
[09:42:32] <johnkpaul> dblosevn: :) it makes sense as a usecase, I've never come acreoss it before
[09:42:49] <johnkpaul> guesswho: oh ok, well then you're getting one
[09:42:53] <guesswho> lol
[09:42:53] <johnkpaul> or building one rather
[09:43:01] <johnkpaul> if this is uber frustrating though, this might not be the jobn for you
[09:43:12] <johnkpaul> most of programmers's lives are spent trying to learn frustrating things like this
[09:43:18] <johnkpaul> but eventually, as you work through it, you understand more and more
[09:43:21] <johnkpaul> 3 hours is _not_ a lot
[09:43:24] <guesswho> yeah i should go flip burgers
[09:43:27] <Seba1989> johnkpaul: Ok, imagine i click an element and maintain the click pressed, can i cancel the upcomming onclick event in any way?
[09:43:28] <dblosevn> ya if you working with translations its a pain when it asks you if you want to translate when theres a language button to switch to english lol
[09:43:31] <johnkpaul> lol, I didnt' say that guesswho
[09:43:38] <johnkpaul> I just mean temper the frustration or you will burn out
[09:43:43] <motka> "most of programmers are crazy when seen from the eyes of other", motka
[09:43:52] <motka> others*
[09:43:58] <johnkpaul> Seba1989: no, but you could handle it manually, rather than binding the onclick to your button changing function, call some mediator that figures out
[09:44:05] <guesswho> fine so line 65
[09:44:16] <guesswho> i put this inside document ready correct ?
[09:44:27] <guesswho> then bind reveal.facebox
[09:44:38] <Seba1989> Ok, thanks :)
[09:44:40] <johnkpaul> guesswho: yes, you can do it after your facebox code
[09:44:44] <johnkpaul> Seba1989: np, have fun
[09:44:59] <guesswho> but then i still dont get how to click the link make facebox appear
[09:45:05] <dblosevn> and from what ive seen it doesnt even work when the content was loaded with ajax, it will give you the option but not translate the text
[09:45:08] <guesswho> if i'm not using click
[09:45:15] <guesswho> or anything to tie the element (href) to facebox
[09:45:30] <johnkpaul> guesswho: you already are, in this example http://jsfiddle.net/kegq7/
[09:45:43] <guesswho> but u said i dont use arel anymore
[09:46:24] <johnkpaul> guesswho: that was before I found line 65
[09:46:30] <johnkpaul> guesswho: do you understand what the documentation is telling you there?
[09:46:32] <guesswho> so now i use arel again
[09:46:42] <johnkpaul> it is saying that you can bind a new event that will call your function every time a lightbox is revealed
[09:46:48] <johnkpaul> so you can do everything you were originally doing and then say
[09:46:53] <johnkpaul> "when reveal is finished, now setup recaptha"
[09:47:44] <guesswho> hmmm
[09:47:48] <guesswho> ok understand a little more now
[09:48:05] <guesswho> let me try to come up with a new test case to show then
[09:48:51] <guesswho> just one thing does jQuery(function($){ $(document).bind() }
[09:48:55] <guesswho> does this go inside here
[09:49:06] <guesswho> or is $(document).bind it's seperate thing
[09:49:51] <guesswho> oh shit
[09:49:52] <guesswho> it's there
[09:49:53] <guesswho> lol
[09:49:55] <guesswho> wow
[09:50:03] <johnkpaul> guesswho: it's working?
[09:50:10] <guesswho> yeah that's total insanity
[09:50:17] <johnkpaul> awesome, congratulations
[09:50:29] <guesswho> so simple but so long for me to do :(
[09:50:36] <guesswho> and you did it
[09:50:40] <guesswho> so congratulations to you
[09:50:41] <guesswho> lol
[09:50:44] <johnkpaul> guesswho: but you've already said you're not a programmer, so who cares
[09:50:45] <johnkpaul> you got it working
[09:50:47] <johnkpaul> and you're learning
[09:50:54] <guesswho> yeah true, you're a good helper
[09:50:57] <guesswho> and encouraging
[09:51:13] <guesswho> a lot of people on irc just say 'you suck'
[09:51:15] <guesswho> thanks a lot man
[09:51:27] <johnkpaul> guesswho: no problem, have fun, come back whenever
[09:53:43] <JmZ> possible to know when a user scrolls inside an external iframe?
[09:53:56] <JmZ> obviously for security reasons you can't use .scroll() or whatever
[09:54:39] <johnkpaul> JmZ: no, you can't, you should watch this though http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQCm8VYn93Y
[09:55:13] <JmZ> johnkpaul: but its 34 mins long :(
[09:55:18] <JmZ> 39*
[09:55:23] <JmZ> it better be good >:)
[09:55:44] <johnkpaul> :D JmZ I guarantee it will be interesting, won't solve your problem, but will give you many ideas of workarounds
[10:11:11] <guesswho> so if the success response is failed
[10:11:15] <guesswho> i would like to use Recaptcha.reload();
[10:11:22] <guesswho> do i put that into .bind() now ?
[10:26:35] <guesswho> i mean there is no success: in recaptcha
[10:26:36] <guesswho> i dont see
[10:42:45] <guesswho> damn
[10:42:50] <guesswho> anyone can help with a recaptcha
[10:42:53] <guesswho> icant get the callback
[10:42:59] <guesswho> so it reloads the recap
[10:43:03] <guesswho> it always goes to the next page
[10:46:38] <guesswho> http://jsfiddle.net/b2TZd/
[10:46:40] <guesswho> this is what i have
[10:46:42] <guesswho> you see line 8 ?
[10:46:53] <guesswho> i can't get the callback to reload the recaptcha, instead it just goes to the next page
[11:00:40] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. So im looking to get started with some Jquery Mobile stuff. Done a little googling already. Can anyone give me some pointers to creating a navigation system based on say a JSON object full of hierarchy data?
[11:01:09] <hazamonzo> I was thinking something simple like generating a load of buttons... clikc a button to drill down fursther into the JSON hierarchy
[11:32:55] <guesswho> http://jsfiddle.net/dHwpT/
[11:32:57] <guesswho> updated
[11:33:04] <guesswho> can anyone help with what i'm supposed to put in the callback here
[11:33:09] <guesswho> so the recaptcha reloads
[11:37:14] <blar1> this isn't strictly a jquery question, but i'm not sure where else to go: what methods are available in javascript to convert a bit string to a Number?
[11:38:06] <systemfault> Hmm
[11:38:18] <systemfault> ?js parseInt("1000", 2);
[11:38:21] <bot-t1> systemfault: 8
[11:38:26] <systemfault> Seems to work
[11:38:46] <systemfault> ?js parseInt("11111111", 2);
[11:38:47] <bot-t1> systemfault: 255
[11:38:51] <systemfault> Wonderful
[11:39:06] <blar1> sweet!
[11:39:30] <blar1> thanks guys!  i've been picking through the Definitive Guide, but hadn't found that function yet
[11:39:38] <systemfault> :)
[11:43:24] <guesswho> can anyone help me with that ?
[11:48:39] <billycomic> please forgive as newly learning jquery. I have an animation is set to increase width and height when mouseover, and decrease to original when mouseout. The problem is, sometimes it will perform the animation multiple times before mouseout. Any help is appreciated.
[11:48:58] <LocalPCGuy> `stop @ billycomic
[11:49:06] <LocalPCGuy> ?stop @ billycomic
[11:49:06] <bot-t1> billycomic, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[11:49:57] <billycomic> is this to be a callback function or just added after the animation function?
[11:49:59] <guesswho> localpcguy you think yoiu can hel pwith a callback
[11:50:54] <LocalPCGuy> billycomic it goes before the animation generally $().stop().animate(...
[11:51:56] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho have you looked at the documentation for recaptcha?
[11:52:08] <guesswho> yeah been at this for a couple hours
[11:52:15] <guesswho> i cant figure it out and it's probably so simple
[11:53:04] <guesswho> callback: function() {console.log("callback");
[11:53:04] <guesswho> }
[11:53:18] <guesswho> even this is not working, but it should log 'callback' everytime a new recaptcha is made ?
[11:53:23] <guesswho> it only prints on page reload
[11:53:31] <guesswho> but if i click reload on captcha it doesnt
[11:54:42] <billycomic> LocalPCGuy - Thanks. worked perfect. Thanks for putting up with a newb...
[11:56:08] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho where does the success variable come from?
[11:56:48] <guesswho> not sure... i mean when i click the form submit the next page gives a response of {success:failed}
[11:57:24] <guesswho> i mean that is coming from my server
[11:57:31] <guesswho> not google... i have no idea
[11:57:59] <billycomic> Is there a better way to add jquery to multiple divs that have different background though css, rather then writing exact same function for each different div #?
[11:58:54] <systemfault> Could you write us an example on jsfiddle.net?
[11:59:02] <guesswho> systemfault me ?
[11:59:22] <systemfault> systemfault: I can't help you with your recaptcha plugin, sorry
[11:59:35] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho you should make a working example in jsfiddle, you may find that it helps you solve the problem
[11:59:48] <guesswho> argh
[11:59:54] <LocalPCGuy> argh?
[12:00:28] <LocalPCGuy> that is JS debugging 101 - reduce your test case to the simplest thing possible, get that working and then plug the working code back into your project
[12:00:35] <guesswho> yeah i mean it goes together with a jquery overlay that points to another url.. .and on top of that i cant post my public google key to even show the test case
[12:00:45] <guesswho> how can i get around posting my google api key
[12:01:10] <guesswho> everything works, it's just the callback
[12:01:17] <guesswho> i need to refresh the image
[12:01:20] <guesswho> but instead it goes to a new page
[12:01:41] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho so were does the success variable come from that is used in your callback func?
[12:02:21] <guesswho> the google server ?
[12:02:45] <guesswho> http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/js/recaptcha_ajax.js
[12:02:55] <guesswho> from here i think, the recaptcha.create is an object from here
[12:03:21] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho in your callback fiddle, it says if ( success == 'false' ){
[12:03:36] <guesswho> yes, i'm guessing ...
[12:03:37] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho but success is not defined as a parameter in the anonymous function
[12:03:49] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho so where does it get created?
[12:03:52] <guesswho> when i click submit i go to a new page with success:false on the page
[12:04:04] <guesswho> i dont understand your question ...
[12:04:09] <guesswho> am i suppose dto create it?
[12:04:12] <sunbeam> hi, i've got some template, i would like to check if more sites use it.. I like to search by specific HTML that's been used.. Can I find this googling?
[12:04:13] <guesswho> or does it come from google ?
[12:05:19] <hazardous> can anyone recommend a tooltip plugin that can load via ajax/can display html/is reasonably modern (+ preferably using html5 data-*, not via href="" since it will be used for spans and divs)? googling turns up a lot of 2011-esque stuff that no longer works with jq1.9
[12:05:23] <hazardous> appreciated
[12:07:03] <billycomic> systemfault - my first time using jsfiddle. Inputing information broke animation. http://jsfiddle.net/billy_comic/3uhWx/
[12:07:08] <guesswho> localpcguy ?
[12:07:57] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho was looking for info on the recaptcha callback function, but in general, you need to get the success variable from somewhere.
[12:08:32] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho and if you are going to a new page, why would your js ever run, it would have reloaded
[12:08:52] <guesswho> well that's exactly what i'm trying to do... refresh the image instead of submit to a new page
[12:09:28] <guesswho> or do i have to submit the form via ajax also?
[12:09:31] <guesswho> i thought that wasnt necessary ?
[12:12:08] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho do you have any indication from google api docs when the callback is called and what parameters are provided to it?
[12:12:44] <guesswho> i've been googling so long and reading the recapctha api..
[12:13:09] <guesswho> do i make the entirre form ajax ?
[12:13:34] <billycomic> When adding same animation function to multiple divs # with different backgrounds, is there a better way than to apply the same fuction to each div# separately. Seems very redundant. Sorry Newby to Jquery
[12:14:50] <slash_me> hello hello
[12:16:57] <LocalPCGuy> guesswho you need to prevent the form from submitting until you get a response from the recaptcha.  That means you probably need to listen for the form submit event, and call event.preventDefault() on that event.  Then, once you get a success from recaptcha you can submit the form
[12:17:24] <slash_nick> jaagr: are you around?
[12:17:33] <LocalPCGuy> but as far as the particulars of recaptcha, I can't really help you there
[12:17:53] <LocalPCGuy> and I gotta run
[12:18:13] <guesswho> ok thanks for the help so far then
[12:30:33] <gotwig> I have $('#' + id) to select a tag by id
[12:30:43] <gotwig> now how can I select a tag by data ?
[12:30:48] <gotwig> by data-attribute
[12:30:54] <gotwig> like data-id
[12:31:30] <zhulikas> $('#' + id + '[data-attribute=value]')
[12:31:44] <systemfault> gotwig: $('[data-id="lol"]')
[12:32:02] <gotwig> yeah
[12:32:06] <gotwig> I saw that.. but it looks not so nice
[12:32:14] <zhulikas> that's an attribute selector
[12:32:17] <zhulikas> it looks the way it looks
[12:33:07] <systemfault> gotwig: Can't do much about it… it's CSS
[12:33:19] <gotwig> I got it...
[12:50:49] <BrandonE> I want to handle a .submit() event, but I have two submit buttons and I only want one of them to get the event. How do I do something like this?
[12:51:30] <bluesm> What $(function(){}) does mean ?
[12:53:47] <Onyx47> BrandonE, why two submits, can't you define the other one as a regular <button> instead of an <input> ?
[12:53:57] <iEatChildren> Im trying to animate the offset of a list of items. This code is working in offsetting the list but its not animated. Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/vAfb3ZNi
[12:54:00] <systemfault> bluesm: It executes the function when the DOM is ready
[12:54:30] <systemfault> bluesm: It's a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[12:55:46] <BrandonE> Onyx47: Submit button and Delete button on the same form. both have to post
[12:56:31] <bluesm> systemfault: Ok. Thanks :)
[12:57:11] <Onyx47> BrandonE, ah, understandable... well, you could use event.currentTarget, that will give you a reference to the actual button you pressed
[12:57:18] <systemfault> BrandonE: are you sending the form with ajax or normally?
[12:57:40] <Onyx47> so you can do something like if(event.currentTarget.attr('id') == "delete")
[12:57:47] <systemfault> If you send it normally.. it's easy
[12:58:43] <BrandonE> systemfault: Normally
[12:59:08] <BrandonE> Onyx47: I figured there'd be a jquery version of this, right?
[12:59:09] <systemfault> BrandonE: Then you can have 10 submit buttons
[12:59:35] <systemfault> BrandonE: You simply need to assign them all the same "name" and set each of them a different "value"
[13:00:48] <Onyx47> BrandonE, it's actually jQuery, the "event" is what you get passed into your function from the submit handler, though I just checked and it returns a DOM element, not a JQuery object, so it would be if($(event.currentTarget).attr('id') == "delete")
[13:02:22] <Onyx47> though I think systemfault has the better idea, I assumed you're actually submitting it through ajax
[13:04:16] <BrandonE> that's annoying but reasonable. probably a habit I should be getting into anyway...I just don't like doing that in case I want to change the labels of my buttons or translate them...I don't like that breaking my code
[13:04:31] <BrandonE> but under systemfault's idea, what do I do in the Javascript?
[13:04:40] <systemfault> BrandonE: Nothing
[13:04:56] <systemfault> BrandonE: You simply need to check the name sent to the server
[13:05:08] <BrandonE> how do I do that?
[13:05:14] <BrandonE> onsubmit?
[13:05:20] <systemfault> BrandonE: server-side.
[13:05:23] <systemfault> Using PHP or whatever
[13:05:31] <BrandonE> I think we might have misunderstood each other
[13:05:44] <BrandonE> I want a JQuery event to happen onsubmit ONLY for one of the two buttons in the form, not both
[13:06:06] <systemfault> Hmm.. ah
[13:07:31] <systemfault> I never did it but you could add a click handler on the two submit buttons…. the handler would do a $('#myForm').data('buttonpressed', 'delete or post'); then if your submit event, you'd simply check that value to know if you need to do anything
[13:13:42] <systemfault> BrandonE: http://jsfiddle.net/N4ZBb/
[13:15:04] <BrandonE> perfect, thanks systemfault
[13:16:27] <ravenzz> BrandonE or this http://jsfiddle.net/dnYEg/
[13:17:01] <Rameau> Oops.
[13:17:06] <ravenzz> I used a namespaced event so you can still do other stuff on submit
[13:18:01] <Onyx47> and I figured out that my idea was faulty, you get the wrong target since it's a submit event, not click event, ooops
[13:18:15] <ravenzz> exactly
[13:19:01] <ravenzz> I have another idea actually
[13:25:24] <ravenzz> mmm http://jsfiddle.net/dnYEg/1/
[13:25:50] <ravenzz> weird the button value is not serialized
[13:26:51] <ravenzz> isn't it a successful control?
[13:27:27] <Onyx47> ravenzz, I don't think it catches submits, the reasoning is probably that you don't get it server-side either
[13:28:33] <ravenzz> from the jQuery docs: "Note: Only "successful controls" are serialized to the string."
[13:28:55] <ravenzz> from the W3C spec: A successful control is "valid" for submission. Every successful control has its control name paired with its current value as part of the submitted form data set.
[13:29:06] <systemfault> Ah...
[13:29:07] <ravenzz> "If a form contains more than one submit button, only the activated submit button is successful."
[13:29:20] <systemfault> ravenzz: There's no way to know that in JS
[13:29:24] <ravenzz> what "activated" means?
[13:29:48] <systemfault> What the W3C says is totally true for "normal" submit
[13:30:38] <systemfault> So i guess there's no other other than flagging  the pressed button ourselves… a bit like I did
[13:32:53] <ravenzz> what do you mean with "normal" submit?
[13:34:16] <systemfault> ravenzz: No ajax
[13:34:32] <systemfault> On normal submit, only the value of the clicked submit button is transmitted
[13:34:40] <systemfault> Not the other ones.
[13:34:47] <ravenzz> that's fine
[13:34:58] <ravenzz> so when one clicks Save it should be serialized
[13:37:23] <Onyx47> I don't think you get any data from anything with type="submit" server-side either, it's a bit counter-intuitive but I guess the browsers implement it that way because the value is just a visual thing for the user if you use an input with type="submit", so even though you can stick something valuable in there if you use a button, it's kinda useless with an input
[13:38:27] <ravenzz> a button's value is sent to the server
[13:38:41] <ravenzz> when that submit button is activated
[13:39:44] <Onyx47> quite possible, I'm not 100% sure on that, I never used it in that way so I might be wrong
[13:39:47] * tw2113 has a yellow js sticker now
[13:46:08] <ravenzz> I think that it is a bug
[14:11:39] <ravenzz> Onyx47 ok doubt solved. buttons are not serialized because you can call serialize() anywhere
[14:12:35] <Onyx47> ravenzz, makes sense, good to know too :)
[14:31:08] <StephenS> binding loader does not work
[14:45:31] <roowilliams> hello.. i'm trying to make a guestbook type app where a user submits a form, using jquery ajax i write to an sql db but then want to instantly display the users entry in with the previous entries... i have a query in my index that fetches all the previous entries on page load, and i am thinking the new entry could be called on the POST callback... do i need a separate php file for the GET request?
[14:45:39] <roowilliams> very new to this - first day on it
[14:46:16] <guesswho> can anyone help with google recaptcha callback ?
[14:50:12] <boytoy> roowilliams: https://github.com/shovon/guestbook-system
[14:50:33] <boytoy> or something idk
[14:50:41] <roowilliams> hehe
[14:50:59] <roowilliams> thanks....my brain's almost cooked so gonna have a break i think
[14:51:27] <roowilliams> eat something then just style it for a bit then i'll have another go at that
[14:55:20] <tkeith> With $.ajax I can pass a "function(data) {...}" as the "success" function. How do I pass an "error" function that receives the same type of "data" argument?
[14:55:59] <djQuery> error:     but I don't think the same "data" is valid there do you
[14:56:20] <tkeith> djQuery: My API passes back a JSON object either way
[14:56:32] <tkeith> djQuery: Although with different attributes
[14:56:45] <djQuery> tkeith, well what type of repsonse is your api giving?
[14:57:27] <tkeith> djQuery: It might return a 400 error with the JSON response: { "error": "invalid_phone_number" }
[14:57:41] <roowilliams> you'll need to pass back an array with the first part indicating if it's an error or not and thesecond part being the data?
[14:57:59] <tkeith> roowilliams: No, the 400 response code indicates that it's an error
[14:59:04] <roowilliams> i'm way out of my depth, but the 400 triggers the error callback to be used and the success to be ignored?
[14:59:13] <roowilliams> seems logical that the same data would work for both
[14:59:41] <tkeith> roowilliams: Yeah, that's what I thought, but it doesn't seem to. "error" expects a function with different arguments than "error"
[14:59:50] <tkeith> roowilliams: ... than "success" *
[14:59:58] <roowilliams> is success success in sending the response?
[15:00:02] <AfroTurf> why would the server response be text/xml when my dataType: "html" ?
[15:00:06] <roowilliams> and error is after it has been processed by the php
[15:00:33] <roowilliams> sorry sending the request
[15:01:10] <tkeith> roowilliams: No, success means it got a 2XX response code
[15:10:20] <djQuery> tkeith, I always returned a success with an object   {error: [{name: name or id of invalid input, errortype: why it was invalid}]}
[15:10:36] <djQuery> tkeith, then I would test for data.error in the success
[15:10:52] <shoky> tkeith:  xhr.responseText  where xhr is the first argument to the error callback
[15:11:42] <djQuery> tkeith, but then I didn't need this much as I was processing input errors client side
[15:11:45] <tkeith> djQuery: I'm trying to avoid REST antipatterns here :/
[15:12:14] <tkeith> shoky: Yeah, I just found that and it works but I have to do $.parseJSON(xhr.responseText) which seems messy
[15:12:14] <djQuery> tkeith, if they fucked them up in a way that could get to the server I just didn't do anything with them
[15:14:32] <goddard> how can i access an element in an array
[15:14:58] <goddard> when i do myObject.myArray[0].name i get an error
[15:15:14] <roowilliams> while you clued up guys are talking about ajax.. is it the done thing to execute a get query on a post callback? and do i need two separate files set up for a post and a get requests? <--noob, started today
[15:15:37] <shoky> ?demo @ goddard
[15:15:37] <b-ot> goddard: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:15:38] <bot-t1> goddard, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:16:09] <shoky> roowilliams: huh?
[15:16:37] <goddard> shoky: here is the structure http://pastebin.com/ppz0TCPL
[15:17:06] <roowilliams> imagine twitter.. where you input your tweet, hit post and then it is stored in a db and appears in the page via ajax
[15:17:19] <shoky> goddard: that doesnt help much
[15:17:38] <roowilliams> would that be a callback to get the new tweet that runs on the ajax post function?
[15:18:23] <goddard> shoky: that is a console.log
[15:18:33] <goddard> shoky: that is my object/array structure
[15:19:14] <shoky> goddard: i cant tell the actual structure from this paste, it doesnt show the full console.log as you see it. even if it did, it STILL doesnt help
[15:19:24] <roowilliams> goddard, isn't the .name bit triyng to access another level in?
[15:19:54] <goddard> roowilliams: i tried myObject.qualifiedBonuses.0.name
[15:20:04] <shoky> goddard: make a jsfiddle, its so fucken easy
[15:20:08] <yogurt_truck> roowilliams: for starters, don't think in terms of "files". and, if I'm getting you right, yes, you'd pass the function that does _whatever_ you need to do when the POST is successful, to .done()
[15:21:14] <roowilliams> yogurt_truck.. cheers, yeh i thougt as much about files - didn't sit right but i'm in at the deep end at the moment for my level and am struggling to make sense! :)
[15:21:26] <goddard> roowilliams: also tried myObject.qualifiedBonuses[0].name
[15:21:49] <yogurt_truck> goddard: where's this object you're dealing with?
[15:21:53] <shoky> goddard: you didnt even show myObject. show the actual structure, not some pastebin that doesnt show shit
[15:21:56] <roowilliams> i can't see how many levels you have on that paste
[15:22:09] <goddard> yogurt_truck: its a json_encode from php
[15:23:20] <yogurt_truck> goddard: jsfiddle a bit of the actual JSON, or something. no one can help what you've showed so far.
[15:23:27] <yogurt_truck> help you*
[15:23:31] <goddard> thanks guys i got it
[15:27:13] <roowilliams> does anyone know of an example of an $.ajax type: POST that runs a GET on complete?
[15:28:31] <grafi> oO
[15:32:07] <shoky> what's "runs a GET on complete" ?
[15:32:49] <roowilliams> bear with me - my vocab isn't up to scratch
[15:33:55] <roowilliams> but like the twitter thing i mentioned earlier, where the user posts, the tweet is saved to a db then appears in the page... did they do the appearing in the page by by running a callback function that queries the db for the most recent tweet once they're done POSTing it?
[15:35:11] <shoky> i dont know what twitter does.. but.. in principle, you wouldn't need to query the db for something you just sent to the db..
[15:35:28] <shoky> of course, you could, and im sure that its done too
[15:35:44] <dblosevn> roowilliams: $.post('xhr.php', {id:1}, function(ret1) { $.get('xhr2.php', {id:2}, function (ret2) { });});
[15:36:08] <shoky> you can be sure twitter doesn't do that ^ :p
[15:36:31] <roowilliams> well i was just thinking of a scenario where the user frefreshed the page and their tweet has disappeared because it never made it to the db, was just output as a javascript object with no persistance
[15:36:37] <dblosevn> well oviously it wouldnt need to, but if the data came from 2 different sources
[15:36:43] <roowilliams> yeh i know - the twitter thing was just an analogy i could get my head around
[15:37:01] <dblosevn> eg twitter and a local db
[15:37:02] <shoky> the GET that you propose wouldn't be in the callback for that POST , it would be some background periodic check for new stuff from the DB, or something like that
[15:37:18] <roowilliams> dblosevn: thanks! so i need a separate php file for my get request?
[15:37:36] <dblosevn> it makes no sense to do that if both sources are local
[15:38:13] <dblosevn> eg post to facebook graph api, get from local db more info
[15:38:39] <dblosevn> thats about the only case i would ever do something like that
[15:40:59] <dblosevn> if both sources are local just add the response of the second request to the first response
[15:51:06] <alexandar> $(this).is('hello');
[15:53:37] <aMoniker> $('#hello .this').is('dog');
[15:54:36] <StephenS> I need help with title
[15:54:51] <StephenS> $('title').before("me"); does not work
[15:54:59] <StephenS> I want to add me and keep current title of page
[15:55:16] <StephenS> but to add me before page title, I could do it with html, but that adds text after page title
[15:56:16] <StephenS> nvm I use prepend() :)
[15:56:43] <roowilliams> woo i got there.. most hacky way ever \o/
[16:00:20] <StephenS> ugh, now I get within ajax request everytime new prepend () :)(
[16:09:02] <boytoy> anybody made or thinking about making the transition from jquery / jquery mobile to zepto?
[16:11:01] <StephenS> If I pickup current title with $('title').val(); and assign var to it, current = $('title').val(); why does this not work?
[16:11:33] <StephenS> boytoy, have an idea?
[16:13:24] <StephenS> nvm fixed. instead of val() I used html()
[16:20:39] <boytoy> cool
[16:24:49] <trollboy> Is this the proper support channel for jquery ui as well?
[16:27:56] <roowilliams> official, we're all hot girls with headsets waiting to take your call

[17:07:02] <gerep> Hello world, can someone please tell me what jquery library was used here: http://modernist.umbrella.al/ to make that effect?
[17:14:03] <roowilliams> gerep: jquery IS a library... but at a glance that looks like a CSS3 transition - no javascript
[17:14:21] <roowilliams> in chrome right click on the bit that animates and click inspect element
[17:14:33] <gerep> roowilliams, yeah, sorry for that and thanks for the css3 transitions ;)
[17:14:51] <roowilliams> style="-webkit-transition: 200ms 800ms; opacity: 1; -webkit-transform: scale(1, 1);"
[17:15:00] <gerep> roowilliams, yeah, found that, thanks ;)
[17:15:09] <roowilliams> cool! right i'm out of here
[17:15:10] <roowilliams> night

[17:45:18] <tallio> hello all. I have a problem with a jquery code may i ask for a solution here ?
[17:45:43] <joshuaos> So check it out, as this page resizes, it goes through several phases, with the narrower screens turning the nav into a jquery drop down, rather than hover (for touch screens).  This works perfectly UNTIL you use the jquery.  With the screen small, click on the menu and then with it open, resize the screen and you'll see the problem.  I'm so confused by it.  http://174.32.118.2/mvclt/
[17:50:13] <tallio> I have few div where classes are 'icorem' and loaded by ajax. I 'd like to make action on them and i ve found on Google explication for how to with DOM... so i use my jquery code http://pastie.org/6436311 but i apparently made mistakes cause that doesn t work as it should. could some1 help plz ?
[18:29:50] <defaultro> Is this normal? in my register.php, I have SESSION variables. In register.php, I also have a $.ajax calling submit.php. The submit.php have session_start(); However, submit_php doesn't have the SESSION variables that is in register.php. They are on the same server
[18:30:35] <defaultro> is this expected? or should submit.php know about the SESSION variables too
[19:01:02] <relipse> how can i use jquery validate plugin to require at least 1 of the 2 checkboxes are checked?
[19:03:12] <fission6> how can i update my dome html with remote html every 15 min. idea being to pull a latest version of a report upstream
[19:06:38] <relipse> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3035634/jquery-validate-check-at-least-one-checkbox
[19:12:12] <fission6> is it wise to use jquerydelay in a recusuve sense to get the affect of "intervals"
[19:14:10] <relipse> does anyoen know how to use $.validator.addMethod
[19:20:18] <relipse>  how to use $.validator.addMethod with 3rd parameter "param" ?
[19:25:41] <wroathe> relipse: ?
[19:25:50] <edocc> good night
[19:25:51] <wroathe> relipse: There isn't a third parameter called param for addMethod
[19:25:54] <wroathe> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/addMethod
[19:27:15] <wroathe> But if you look at the arguments passed in the examples you can see clearly how to work with it
[19:57:59] <solarflares> okay si put 3 different kinds of trail mix togther
[20:10:51] <fission6> anyone every update a dom portion from a remote call, every N seconds or some interval?
[20:24:37] <solarflares> whats the issue
[20:31:25] <Braden`> Does anyone have a link to the twipper apis for the different programming languages?  I lost the link and the twitter api page is horrible.  Can't find anything on it.
[20:45:34] <scruz> hello. i've a form element selected using $. how do i access, say, its value property?
[20:46:34] <coldhead> $('thing').val()
[20:46:34] <b-ot> coldhead: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[20:47:17] <Agamemnus> scruz
[20:47:24] <Agamemnus> like they said
[20:47:30] <Agamemnus> .get is what you need
[20:47:40] <Agamemnus> if you have an object and want to get the dom element
[20:47:49] <Agamemnus> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[20:49:32] <scruz> yeah, found that, thanks. http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-pull-a-native-dom-element-from-a-jquery-object/ says array indexing is faster, but are there an drawbacks to that?
[20:50:29] <coldhead> no drawbacks you need to worry about
[20:50:48] <Agamemnus> I don't know
[20:51:06] <Agamemnus> it seems that you'd use [0] indexing when you didn't have get() at all
[20:51:10] <Agamemnus> and get() for safety
[20:51:17] <Agamemnus> i didn't know about the indexing.
[20:51:20] <coldhead> $('thing').val() is hella more readable than $('thing')[0].value
[20:51:21] <Agamemnus> something new!
[20:56:32] <scruz> coldhead: actually, i wanted to get the selected item for a select
[20:57:08] <coldhead> ?selected
[20:57:09] <bot-t1> :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[20:57:20] <Agamemnus> you can do that in regular js once you get the dom object though
[20:57:21] <coldhead> much lazier
[20:57:31] <Agamemnus> ok
[20:57:41] <Agamemnus> lazy, lazy, lazy.
[20:57:55] <coldhead> lazy is gooood
[21:06:20] <coldhead> goodbye forever, Agamemnus
[21:08:13] <scruz> coldhead: here's my use case: depending on what option is selected on my select, i need to make an ajax request to populate a table (headers and all). could you recommend a table library for that?
[21:09:28] <coldhead> do you NEED a table lib?
[21:09:40] <coldhead> or do you just need to show tabley data?
[21:10:05] <coldhead> if you just want to throw html into the page you don't need a lib
[21:10:11] <scruz> well, ability to dump csv would be very nice.
[21:10:22] <coldhead> i don't know of any that do that
[21:10:34] <coldhead> but they might
[21:10:38] <scruz> seems http://datatables.net/extras/tabletools/ does that
[21:10:46] <scruz> but let me start simple and work up.
[21:11:04] <coldhead> datatables is a popular option
[21:23:31] <scruz> coldhead: thankee kindly
[21:25:55] <nnumerals> yo
[21:25:57] <nnumerals> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15319001/how-do-you-determine-the-client-side-requests-necessary-for-logins-http-reques
[21:26:02] <nnumerals> follow me on that one
[21:26:30] <nnumerals> where are these content-type and other network/http credentials defined in a website?
[21:27:00] <nnumerals> user-agent, cache-control, Accept(charset, encoding, language)
[21:27:57] <kojul> they are in the request headers, as in, they are part of the call you make to the web server
[21:28:23] <kojul> or the response headers, as in part of what the server returns
[21:28:35] <kojul> depends which ones specifically you are talking about
[21:30:22] <nnumerals> yeah ic
[21:30:30] <nnumerals> how would you find out what are necessary for a login request?
[21:30:53] <nnumerals> since it's not in the html anywhere, the server must make it available to the clients or nothing would work
[21:30:59] <nnumerals> how would you probe that info?
[21:31:10] <nnumerals> think large-scale
[21:31:19] <nnumerals> browsers/mail clients
[21:31:49] <kojul> nnumerals: chrome dev tools network tab?
[21:32:09] <kojul> that's usually what i use to look at headers.
[21:32:31] <nnumerals> yes, what actually causes the server to send you those though
[21:32:37] <nnumerals> is it just connect(ip:port)
[21:32:49] <nnumerals> and it sends you content-type, accept, others?
[21:33:10] <nnumerals> how can i commence this handshake to a login url?
[21:34:05] <kojul> it's part of the response to your request. I don't know of any references for the basics of HTTP off the top of my head, but that's probably what you need to look into.
[21:36:20] <kojul> and if that's your stack overflow question, then 1) this isn't really the place and 2) automation is not as easy as you'd think it would be.
[21:49:41] <aMoniker> Free prisms for all! https://github.com/aMoniker/jQuery-prism
[21:51:38] * RandalSchwartz makes a rainbow
[21:52:49] * RandalSchwartz had to look up "rectangular prism", since the only kind he had seen is the triangle rainbow kind
[21:58:50] <coldhead> aMoniker: did you test the sample code?
[21:59:35] <aMoniker> coldhead: which part? some of it is pseudocode
[21:59:44] <coldhead> well a person like me
[21:59:52] <coldhead> doesn't see a link to a working demo
[22:00:00] <coldhead> so creates one on jsfiddle
[22:00:08] <coldhead> and pastes in the deluxe code
[22:00:16] <coldhead> because it seems interesting
[22:00:22] <coldhead> and it has syntax errors
[22:00:27] <coldhead> and i get very tired
[22:01:16] <aMoniker> ok, good point
[22:01:18] <aMoniker> one sec
[22:01:49] <RandalSchwartz> bad sales if sample code is broken
[22:05:21] <aMoniker> coldhead: ok, deluxe sample code should work now
[22:07:52] <RandalSchwartz> so I just need to add <div id="element"/>
[22:07:58] <RandalSchwartz> that didn't seem to be enough
[22:08:24] <RandalSchwartz> oh wait.  jquery 1.9.1?
[22:08:26] <RandalSchwartz> anythign else?
[22:08:31] <aMoniker> that's it
[22:08:50] <RandalSchwartz> this not doing anything: http://jsfiddle.net/cwVEG/
[22:09:06] <RandalSchwartz> what else do I need?
[22:09:28] <RandalSchwartz> shouldn't I see something pretty in "result"?
[22:09:52] <aMoniker> jsfiddle doesn't include my plugin
[22:10:03] <RandalSchwartz> well, then I need more. :)
[22:10:08] <RandalSchwartz> docs should say
[22:10:31] <aMoniker> RandalSchwartz: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/cwVEG/1/
[22:10:53] <aMoniker> you need the plugin to use the plugin… docs shouldn't need to say that
[22:11:08] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, add in as resource
[22:11:15] <RandalSchwartz> but that still didn't seem to work :(
[22:11:29] <aMoniker> hmm, I see it working
[22:11:30] <RandalSchwartz> oh - there it is
[22:11:33] <aMoniker> ah
[22:11:53] <aMoniker> I should make the colors nicer for the demo code too...
[22:12:16] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, had to hit update
[22:14:26] <aMoniker> there we go, much better demo colors
[22:16:25] <aMoniker> And if you want to manipulate your prism… https://github.com/aMoniker/jQuery-3D
[22:17:20] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/R7Tgv/4/
[22:18:02] <aMoniker> :D
[22:18:27] <aMoniker> hmm, * doesn't work for me
[22:18:35] <aMoniker> only one panel rotates
[22:19:38] <aMoniker> I guess hovering 3D elements doesn't work quite right in webkit
[22:20:15] <coldhead> probably some horrible z-index thing
[22:22:19] <rmill> z-index: 99999999.999px;
[22:22:41] <coldhead> thanks rmill, this worked for me
[22:26:14] <RandalSchwartz> that's a lot of px
[22:26:31] <tw2113> z-index doesn't even take px
[22:26:32] <RandalSchwartz> wouldn't I have to turn around to see that? :)
[22:27:01] <RandalSchwartz> "it's in the next room, sorry"
[22:27:13] <aMoniker> I should add a default param for `sides`...
[22:27:31] <RandalSchwartz> sides should default to cole slaw and carrots.
[22:29:03] <aMoniker> lulz
[22:29:46] <RandalSchwartz> oh darn - forgot we lose an hour tonight
[22:29:56] <RandalSchwartz> even though I've been G+'ing it for the past hour :)
[22:30:10] <RandalSchwartz> check out http://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/events.html
[22:30:20] <RandalSchwartz> very bizarre time changes in the next 30 days
[22:30:36] <RandalSchwartz> we need to get rid of DST.  now.
[22:33:12] <rmill> tw2113: Oh it doesn't? Darn.
[22:33:23] <rmill> Better Luck Next Time.
[22:36:49] <defaultro> was just thinking........ Is it possible to create/assign a PHP session variable where source value will be coming from a json response?
[22:45:20] <coldhead> that is SUCH a ##php question
