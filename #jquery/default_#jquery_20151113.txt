[00:33:17] <confoozed> I guess I am looking for a good example of using multiple jquery ui effects at once - like if I want to animate from x - 50, alpha 0-100 and scale all at once.   Any pointers to documentation appreciated.  Thanks!
[00:53:35] <zizzl> Hey all
[00:54:05] <zizzl> Any tutorial or plugin that could help to create a popup modal when a #hashtag is in the url?
[00:54:42] <zizzl> I have a mailchimp form that I want to pop up a success box on success, and they allow you to redirect to a custom url
[01:01:46] <johndoe2> zizzl if(window.location.hash) { //start my modal here }
[01:02:12] <johndoe2> var hash = window.location.hash.substring(1); if you need to check its value or whatever
[01:09:55] <Cork> zizzl: another option is to use :target in a css selector and display it that way
[01:40:35] <WhirledPress> Good evening all
[01:41:21] <WhirledPress> How do I get the correct character on a keydown event? I have tried numerous examples, all of which neglect the case consideration. A is not a, for example.
[01:43:27] <strayyArch> o_0 is this true when using a different machine
[01:44:08] <strayyArch> WhirledPress,
[01:44:19] <johndoe2> WhirledPress try using keypress
[01:45:05] <johndoe2> WhirledPress http://jsfiddle.net/t8Ybs/2/
[01:47:21] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/cj7br89w/
[01:49:37] <WhirledPress> ugg. but it doesn't work when replacing selected text even. I guess there's just no uniform way to send validation methods to input...
[01:49:51] <WhirledPress> It all just seems so kludged together the way it's done now
[02:03:53] <Mark_____> can anyone suggest any good name for a new design company?
[02:13:17] <WhirledPress> johndoe2, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6ny504jj/8/
[02:17:28] <johndoe2> WhirledPress do you have a question for me?
[02:19:39] <WhirledPress> I was trying to show you what I was basically hoping to accomplish with regex. But instead of mapping "n" to [0-9], it would parse the extended regex into char-by-char regexes.
[02:21:11] <johndoe2> WhirledPress gotcha, yeah that's actually way above my training in jquery but I see what you mean
[02:46:37] <zizzl> Cork how can I use :target to get a specific hash
[02:47:17] <Cork> #the-hash:target { display: block; }
[02:48:01] <Cork> but what you more likely want to do is something like
[02:48:12] <Cork> .modal:target { display: block; }
[02:48:26] <Cork> so the .modal that matches the target gets displayed
[02:49:03] <Cork> and ya, that only works if the modal have an id matching the hash
[02:51:05] <zizzl> Cork, hmm it would seem that your first example would show when /#the-hash is there, how would the later example know which hash to use
[03:16:48] <hellyeah> hey i want to filter the button when clicking radio button that should show buttons when you click it. All radio button works fine. But why other radio button didnt show the related button http://jsfiddle.net/1qgqz4mv/136/ i

[03:45:54] <jop008> I have this $('#4654_re_inspection_date').datepicker({     dateFormat: "dd-mm-yy" when I select a date like 30-11 I got in the form field 30-11-20152015
[03:46:01] <jop008> So twice the years
[03:49:20] <jop008> see also here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10297979/jquery-datepicker-issues-formatting-date
[03:50:11] <Maxou88> somone have already use this https://datatables.net ?
[03:51:45] <lite_> Can i create an event listener that fires if the amount of children that an element has changes?
[03:53:37] <Xatenev> lite_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3219758/detect-changes-in-the-dom
[04:02:32] <Cork> lite_, Xatenev: though note mutation observers requires quite new browsers
[04:02:46] <lite_> damn
[04:02:53] <lite_> yeah thats gonna be an issue
[04:03:01] <Cork> lite_: the better option is to have a "check children" callback
[04:03:14] <Cork> and call it when what ever code it was that updated the dom
[04:03:27] <Cork> *it from what ever*
[04:03:42] <Cork> mutation observers is also quite clonky to use
[04:04:03] <Cork> so it is normally much nicer to use a clean function call if you can do that
[04:04:54] <Cork> ex something like $('#target').load(url, function() { checkChildren($('#target')) });
[04:05:19] <lite_> right
[04:05:41] <lite_> its in an angular directive so i'm gonna have to pass that check function from one directive to the other
[04:46:45] <Sourcey> Hello. How can I do an action when i focus/click a input field
[04:47:05] <Sourcey> I have tried ($('#id').click(function()
[04:47:19] <Sourcey> and is(":focus")
[04:49:31] <Cork> Sourcey: bind a focus event handler
[04:50:55] <beasty> Cork: ! o/
[04:51:23] <Cork> ~\~o
[04:51:56] <Sourcey> Cork $('#id').focus(function()
[04:51:59] <Sourcey> like this?
[04:52:02] <Sourcey> still not working
[04:52:18] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[04:54:37] <Sourcey> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/cc8rf1ze/
[04:57:04] <Cork> Sourcey: https://jsfiddle.net/cc8rf1ze/1/
[04:57:28] <Cork> Sourcey: though note if you bind the handler like that it will only work for one element
[04:57:39] <Cork> if you ever add another element with the same id it won't work
[04:57:53] <Sourcey> ah true
[04:57:57] <Sourcey> damn
[04:58:40] <Cork> what i would recommend is to use classes
[04:58:46] <Cork> and delegate it to the container
[04:58:50] <Sourcey> Im still not getting a reaction from the event
[04:59:35] <Cork> Sourcey: http://jsfiddle.net/cc8rf1ze/2/
[04:59:45] <Cork> Sourcey: in the jsfiddle?
[04:59:52] <Cork> make sure to open the console
[05:00:11] <Sourcey> yep, getting it in fiddle but not on my page
[05:00:12] <Sourcey> with same code
[05:00:29] <Cork> most likely cause you try to bind the handler before the element exists
[05:00:50] <Cork> $() searches the dom for all elements matching the selector
[05:01:06] <Cork> .on/.click/etc. then loops that array and binds an event handler to each of them
[05:01:13] <Cork> if $() doesn't find anything
[05:01:19] <Cork> nothing will have an event handler
[05:01:37] <Sourcey> works with adding the class
[05:01:44] <Cork> if another element matching the selector is added later, that won't be included
[05:01:54] <Cork> Sourcey: the /2/ use delegation too
[05:02:58] <Sourcey> works now m8, but getting double clicks
[05:03:09] <Sourcey> console.log shows two "click"
[05:03:21] <Cork> THAT is most likely what changed it
[05:23:51] <jpost> is there a way to stop a class from loading on your page after document .ready
[05:26:04] <Cork> jpost: a class??
[05:26:24] <Cork> as in a <elm class="something"></elm>?
[05:26:31] <jpost> yes
[05:26:35] <jpost> sorry
[05:26:49] <slax0r> loading as in displaying?
[05:26:51] <Cork> from loading...
[05:27:02] <Cork> ah
[05:27:15] <jpost> i have it in my css to display: none
[05:27:23] <jpost> but the problem is, it isnt there when the page loads
[05:27:34] * Cork nods
[05:27:48] <Cork> jpost: just do $('.the-class').hide() in .ready
[05:28:01] <Cork> and remove the old display: none;
[05:28:12] <Cork> though man you made a confusing question
[05:28:27] <jpost> that would work. its not part of the page?
[05:29:06] <jpost> hard to explain i suppose..
[05:29:13] <Cork> not part of the page?!?
[05:29:18] <jpost> After a video, the element shows up..
[05:29:26] <jpost> the element is not displayed until the video ends
[05:29:44] <Cork> ok, this question makes absolutely no sense...
[05:31:06] <jpost> is there a way to know if an element gets added after document .ready?
[05:31:14] <Cork> not really
[05:31:21] <Cork> at least not cross browser
[05:31:35] <Cork> there are mutationobservers you could look into for newer browsers
[05:31:52] <jpost> probably only a timer that runs constantly and hides the element when found
[05:31:55] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[05:34:25] <jpost> think i may be able to use .change to get what im after
[05:51:25] <Mandevil\splat> Hm, blur events should bubble up as usual, right?
[05:51:52] <Mandevil\splat> I attach blur handler to TABLE that has a INPUT elements inside, yet I see no blur events.
[05:53:11] <Mandevil\splat> Even if I manuall trigger blur on one of the INPUTs, nothing gets propagated to the TABLE.
[05:56:02] <Mandevil\splat> OMG, focus and blur events _do_not_ bubble up.
[05:56:10] <Mandevil\splat> Consistency be damned.
[05:57:51] <Cork> Mandevil\splat: depends on the browser
[05:58:06] <Cork> blur and focus doesn't normally bubble
[05:58:15] <Cork> forusin and focusout does though
[06:36:34] <gavit> if obj = [] why does "var length = "length" in obj" give length = undefined
[06:42:42] <robhol> wat
[06:46:37] <naschine> if initialized var obj = [] then obj.length = 0 not undefined (not sure I understood it correctly though... or to cite robhol "wat"? xD )
[06:49:38] <Cork> naschine: [] is an array not an object
[06:49:42] <Cork> you want {} for objects
[06:50:13] <Cork> oh, missed the original question
[06:51:36] <Cork> gavit: that doesn't sound correct
[06:51:56] <robhol> or sane
[06:52:16] <Cork> var arr = [], length = 'length' in arr; length == true
[06:52:20] <Cork> so ya, can't reproduce
[06:52:39] <Cork> if you change [] to {} it makes sense though
[06:57:20] <gavit> Cork: I'm fighting with datatables :)
[06:58:03] <gavit> naschine: that's what I guessed too
[06:58:36] <gavit> naschine: I'm getting the same as this guy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31149836/uncaught-typeerror-cannot-use-in-operator-to-search-for-length-in-trigge
[06:58:52] <gavit> naschine: the thing is that I am using a much newer datatables gem
[07:01:53] <hellyeah> hey
[07:02:01] <gavit> brb, gonna need to fight with a server
[07:02:46] <hellyeah> pls look line 71-76 when you clcik radio button it should show specified color bbut it doesn not work http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/79/ . Don worry about my bad design ppls
[07:05:02] <naschine> works for me
[07:05:31] <Cork> gavit: not sure what that comment means
[07:05:32] <hellyeah> you see related button
[07:05:40] <hellyeah> naschine:?
[07:05:52] <hellyeah> click Green for example naschine
[07:06:04] <hellyeah> all buttons are gona but green buttons should stay
[07:06:09] <naschine> Cork: Yeah, I was not sure what the question was... so I assumed he wanted just the length of an empty array
[07:06:22] <naschine> hellyeah: that's what's happening
[07:06:36] <hellyeah> aha
[07:06:38] <hellyeah> it worked
[07:06:39] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:06:47] <hellyeah> it is not working before
[07:06:50] <hellyeah> YAY !!!
[07:06:54] <naschine> lol
[07:07:36] <hellyeah> i swear
[07:07:40] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:07:42] <hellyeah> anyway
[07:07:45] <hellyeah> :
[07:07:47] <hellyeah> :3
[07:11:20] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> So is there any approach easier than $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().siblings(selector).children(selector).children(selector)
[07:11:40] <Cork> yes
[07:11:56] <Cork> $(this).closest('selector').find('selector chain')
[07:12:09] <Cork> closest is for the parent you want to find
[07:12:31] <Cork> i would prob go one step further then you did and just use find there
[07:12:47] <Cork> (and skip the sibling part)
[07:13:22] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Thanks. I'll research closest and find
[07:13:39] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Sounds like that's hell of a lot easier and more readable
[07:13:48] <Cork> and more robust
[07:13:59] <K4T> Hi, I know that channel is not related to CSS and Bootstrap, but I can not get help on official ghost channel and some of you maybe can help me.
[07:14:02] <Cork> doesn't break just cause you need to wrap something in a div or something like that
[07:14:07] <K4T> I have problem with following grid: http://jsfiddle.net/b6c1moey/6/ In "SM view" item 3 is blocked by item 1. I have now idea how I can use clearfix there to make it good. Can someone help me to solve that problem, please?
[07:14:37] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Cork, yeah, that's true
[07:15:11] <Cork> i basically never use .parent() and i never chain parent() calls
[07:31:25] <manners13> hey guys
[07:31:28] <manners13> can anyone help
[07:31:45] <taplar> sure, just ask.  someone will most likely pipe in
[07:31:49] <manners13> iv got this issue with file uploads where if the file is under 10mb it works fine
[07:31:55] <manners13> yet over 10mb it fails
[07:32:16] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/a17khfyf/
[07:32:20] <manners13> thats the code im using
[07:32:21] <Cork> that is most likely a memory limit on the server side
[07:32:32] <manners13> php limit is set at 20mb
[07:32:42] <manners13> is there another limit i should look at?
[07:32:52] <Cork> remember that that is base64 encoded
[07:33:02] <Cork> so + ~34%
[07:33:35] <manners13> ok so if i set the limit to say 50mb then i should be fine for a 20mb file
[07:33:47] <Cork> ya
[07:33:53] <manners13> kk ill try that many thanks
[07:33:57] <Cork> but make sure that won't oom the server
[07:34:09] <Cork> cause that is 50mb * number of users
[07:34:14] <Cork> or rather visitors
[07:34:55] <manners13> nah its a database application for a recruitment agency
[07:35:02] <manners13> and its on a 4tb server
[07:36:02] <Cork> well 50mb * 10000 users is .5t
[07:36:06] <Cork> just for the file upload :)
[07:36:24] <manners13> yeah most files are only 600k its the odd 20mb file thats causing issues
[07:36:33] * Cork nods
[07:36:41] <manners13> usually its just a scan of drivers license etc
[07:37:23] <slax0r> php has two settings
[07:37:28] <slax0r> check post_max_size too
[07:37:37] <Cork> ah, right
[07:37:41] <Cork> i totally forgot that
[07:38:02] <Kars-T> Is there a recommended structure for jquery plugins? Should I use boilerplate?
[07:38:27] <Cork> Kars-T: there are, but they differ if you plan to make a widget or a functionality plugin
[07:38:48] <Cork> if you plan to make a widget i would recommend widgetfactory
[07:41:26] <Kars-T> Cork: This here? https://jqueryui.com/widget/
[07:41:45] <Cork> yes
[07:41:51] <Cork> it is used part of jquery ui
[07:42:04] <Cork> but it is also provided as a separate code snippet
[07:42:18] <Kars-T> I am not sure where to draw the line if it is a widget or functionality. I am putting together some functionality with JUI sortable and draggable.
[07:42:22] <Cork> but if you already use jquery ui you don't need any extra code to use it
[07:42:54] <Cork> Kartagis: that sounds like widget factory would be a good fit
[07:43:14] <Kartagis> you mean Kars-T
[07:43:15] <Cork> Kars-T: by widet vs no widget is if the code is meant to be visible or not
[07:43:20] <Cork> opps
[07:43:21] <Cork> yes
[07:43:25] <Kars-T> :)
[07:43:39] <Cork> so ex $.ajax would be a bad fit for widget factory
[07:44:11] <Cork> also something that just adds some css values or something like that to the target element
[07:44:21] <Cork> would be better as a simple plugin
[07:44:30] <Lebbe> is there a way to have jQuery putting a timestamp on URLs for css in the same way it does for js files in ajax requests?
[07:44:34] <Cork> but if it starts to add elements, and bind click and drag and so on
[07:44:37] <Cork> then ya, a widget
[07:45:10] <Cork> Lebbe: you shouldn't really load css dynamically
[07:45:28] <Lebbe> I load a html file dynamically that contains a reference to css and js
[07:45:34] <Lebbe> nothing I can do about it im afraid :(
[07:45:44] <Lebbe> seems like jquery adds a timestamp on the url for the js-reference
[07:45:45] <Cork> well jquery doesn't load those
[07:45:47] <Cork> the browser does
[07:45:50] <Lebbe> oh
[07:46:00] <Lebbe> so the browser add the timestamp on the url?
[07:46:07] <Cork> heh
[07:46:18] <Cork> when you give $.ajax or similar an url
[07:46:32] <Cork> and it can load the content and avoid caches by adding a timestamp
[07:46:37] <Lebbe> because it behaves t he same across all browser I have tested with
[07:46:41] <Cork> but that ONLY affects the url given to ajax
[07:46:49] <Cork> not content referenced in the content
[07:47:03] <Cork> cause the later is loaded by the browser not jquery
[07:47:18] <Lebbe> ok, so all browsers add _=timestamp for js-files referenced to in whatever jquery ajax loads
[07:47:28] <Lebbe> as a url parameter
[07:47:29] <Lebbe> interesting
[07:47:30] <Cork> ... NO
[07:47:36] <Cork> read what i said again
[07:47:41] <Lebbe> well
[07:47:58] <Cork> if you have _= in the url the server side adds those
[07:48:03] <Lebbe> I load a resource something.html with jquery, wich includes two references, something.css and something.js
[07:48:15] <Lebbe> something.js is loaded as something.js?_=timestamp
[07:48:22] <Lebbe> but something.css is loaded with a clean url
[07:48:24] <Lebbe> in all browsers
[07:48:46] <Lebbe> just try it out and see for yourself
[07:49:17] <Lebbe> the url parameter is NOT in the .html file (goes without saying?)
[07:50:15] <taplar> not really.  $.ajax doesn't tack on a timestamp.  so something else is doing it
[07:50:38] <Lebbe> hmm
[07:50:45] <Lebbe> even internet explorer 10 behaves this way
[07:51:25] <taplar> as Cork said, tacking on a timestamp will cause the file to avoid being cached, which is not typically something you want to avoid
[07:51:45] <Cork> also it is not something the browser does
[07:52:06] <Lebbe> just try it out and see for yourself
[07:52:13] <Lebbe> shall I put up an example for you to see?
[07:52:31] <taplar> i'm not doubting your seeing something.  i'm just describing what the language does not do
[07:52:39] <taplar> *library
[07:53:03] <Lebbe> Cork just said it is not something the browser do
[07:53:13] <taplar> nope, they don't
[07:53:15] <Lebbe> but all i have now is jquery and some html and a web server
[07:53:21] <taplar> in that aspect, they're dumb clients
[07:53:28] <Lebbe> okay
[07:54:58] <Cork> Lebbe: as you see nothing http://jsfiddle.net/9Lx0wbfn/
[07:55:26] <Cork> well not really
[07:55:32] <Cork> the cache is part of the browser
[07:55:47] <Cork> the timestamp is to work around _the cache in the browser_
[07:55:54] <Cork> so it makes no sense for the browser to add them...
[07:55:58] <Lebbe> well
[07:56:13] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Jeez, managed to go from $(this).parent().parent().prev().prev().prev().children('.item-name'); to $(this).closest('.edit').find('.item-name'). Sweet, thanks Cork
[07:56:21] <Lebbe> in my browser jquery.weekpicker is collected with a timestamp in your example Cork
[07:56:23] <taplar> wow
[07:56:26] <Cork> Zero_Zip_Zilch: np
[07:56:45] <Kars-T> Cork++
[07:56:47] <Lebbe> if you open the debugger and see in the network tab
[07:57:30] <Lebbe> so who does this. the browser, or jquery?
[07:58:31] <Cork> i don't get it so not sure
[07:58:46] <taplar> i do that's weird
[07:58:55] <taplar> i'm in ff fwiw
[07:58:57] <Kars-T> Lebbe: JQ is just controlling the browser.
[07:59:09] <delboy1978uk> how do i select form elements with the required property?
[07:59:19] <Lebbe> I get it in chrome, ie, firefox and safari
[07:59:22] <Cork> well what i can see happening is that browser tends to ignore inline scripts
[07:59:30] <Cork> when they get appended to the document
[07:59:40] <Cork> so jquery might load it as getScript
[07:59:50] <Cork> and that might be what you're getting
[08:00:18] <delboy1978uk> in fact - all EMPTY form elements with the required property
[08:00:46] <delboy1978uk> i.e. all the ones that HTML5 form validation cracks up at when you dont fill them in, i need to add some css classes
[08:01:05] <Cork> there we go, now at least i can reproduce it
[08:02:28] <delboy1978uk> in fact i guess i could just add a required class and check for that. but would be nice to know how to select an element with required property
[08:02:44] <taplar> delboy1978uk: you meaning the attribute required?
[08:03:08] <delboy1978uk> .attr() or .prop(), could never figure the difference
[08:03:18] <delboy1978uk> seem to do same thing
[08:03:24] <taplar> html tags have attributes
[08:03:30] <taplar> dom elements have properties
[08:04:04] <taplar> but you mean like <input type="text" required> ?
[08:04:08] <delboy1978uk> yes
[08:04:10] <taplar> k
[08:04:27] <Cork> HA
[08:04:30] <delboy1978uk> aha is it this? $('[required]').each(function() {
[08:04:32] <taplar> $(formSelector).find(inputSelector).filter('[required]')
[08:04:39] <delboy1978uk> square brackets
[08:04:41] <delboy1978uk> awesome
[08:04:44] <delboy1978uk> thanks guys
[08:04:52] <taplar> what did you find Cork?
[08:04:54] <Cork> taplar, Lebbe: jquery uses jQuery._evalUrl for scripts
[08:05:09] <delboy1978uk> now is there a way to say, only the empty ones, or do i need to write a wee check for that?
[08:05:16] <taplar> so jquery is doing the script load on an append
[08:05:57] <taplar> delboy1978uk: maybe there is an ':empty' operator?  dunno, otherwise you can do a simple filter to check this.value.trim().length < 1
[08:06:32] <delboy1978uk> good shout tapi, thanks
[08:07:15] <Z4sk4> hi all
[08:07:18] <Lebbe> Cork: cool so you confirm that jquery actually puts on that _=timestamp url parameter?
[08:07:27] <Cork> taplar: ya, like i said jquery executes all script tags that exist in html when appended
[08:07:36] <Cork> cause browsers don't run them
[08:07:42] <Z4sk4> how can i dowload a info of a external web that have jquery with curl. wget or lynx?
[08:07:47] <Cork> Lebbe: it fetches inline scripts
[08:07:51] <Cork> not random urls
[08:07:52] <taplar> so that really is kinda another detractor from dynamically appending script includes.  they'd never be cached
[08:07:52] <Lebbe> yeah
[08:07:57] <Lebbe> so back to my question then
[08:07:59] <Z4sk4> when i download it, i dont see the info that i need that are in jquery...
[08:08:05] <Cork> and i just answered it
[08:08:06] <Lebbe> how can I get jquery to do this with .css files as well? :D
[08:08:06] <Cork> no
[08:08:15] <Cork> cause css are loaded by the browser
[08:08:20] <Lebbe> oh
[08:08:24] <Cork> while inline scripts needs to be executed by jquery
[08:09:24] <Lebbe> well in that case, it seems all browsers uses the wrong http headers when they fetch the css files
[08:09:41] <Lebbe> but i think that is a xmlhttprequest bug
[08:10:16] <Cork> uh...
[08:10:26] <Cork> GAH, please start listning
[08:10:29] <Lebbe> it doesnt send the etag header on those requests
[08:10:30] <Cork> loading css is not ajax
[08:10:58] <Lebbe> well, why does the browser fetch the css files linked to inside the ajax loaded .html
[08:11:02] <Lebbe> but with wrong headers?
[08:11:18] <Cork> from javascript there is no difference between an <img> tag and <link>
[08:11:18] <Lebbe> you just said jquery does not fetch the css
[08:11:43] <Cork> my point is that how css in a partial loaded over ajax works
[08:11:54] <Cork> compared to css loaded for a full page load is none
[08:12:06] <Cork> it is exactly the same thing
[08:13:25] <Cork> taplar: for reference https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.12-stable/src/manipulation.js#L664 down to 706
[08:13:30] <taplar> k
[08:13:41] <Cork> especially line 698
[08:14:10] <Cork> i knew it did the globalEval
[08:14:17] <Cork> the _evalUrl was new to me
[08:14:46] <taplar> i'm not familiar with it.  wonder why it does the timestamp thing.  what issue it's trying to avoid
[08:14:54] <taplar> ohhh
[08:15:04] <taplar> could it be that if it was cached the js would not run?
[08:15:19] <taplar> re-run
[08:15:23] <Cork> na, it is to work around ppl changing the script content in each run
[08:15:31] <taplar> ah
[08:15:36] <Cork> the content of the script is ran through eval(string)
[08:15:46] <Cork> so if it comes from cache or not doesn't matter
[08:16:16] <hellyeah> hey
[08:16:50] <taplar> that's a really interesting nugget for the day, :D
[08:17:06] <hellyeah> can i have a question it is rather simple but  it said when radio button has same name attr you can click multiple radiobutton but noıt here. Why is that? http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/79/
[08:17:39] <taplar> uh, no
[08:17:46] <taplar> radio buttons with the same name are exclusive
[08:17:50] <Lebbe> thanks for help and pointer Cork
[08:17:56] <taplar> that's the working operation of a radio
[08:18:04] <taplar> if you want multiple then it would be checkboxes
[08:18:05] <Lebbe> I think I for now will be satisfied that at least the javascript at least will not be cached
[08:18:38] <Cork> uh...
[08:18:41] <Lebbe> css should not be linked in pages we collect with ajax either way
[08:18:52] <Cork> Lebbe: also you know you will load more and more and more css into the page?
[08:19:01] <Lebbe> i didnt know that
[08:19:03] <Cork> there is no replace mechanism for css
[08:19:08] <Lebbe> hmm
[08:19:21] <Lebbe> i am talking about loading a .html page which references css, btw
[08:19:22] <Cork> javascript replaces things with the same name, so that is fairly fine
[08:19:26] <hellyeah> check second answer taplar http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/79/
[08:19:28] <hellyeah> ops
[08:19:41] <Cork> Lebbe: now you trigger loading more css doesn't matter like i said
[08:19:49] <hellyeah> taplar: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20982993/html-radio-buttons-allowing-multiple-selections
[08:19:51] <Cork> each time you load css it will add another stylesheet to the page
[08:20:09] <Lebbe> im not loading a css directly with ajax
[08:20:19] <Cork> doesn't matter
[08:20:20] <Lebbe> i am loading .html pages with ajax that links to css files
[08:20:25] <Cork> cause you can't do that
[08:20:28] <Cork> like i've said
[08:20:30] <hellyeah> taplar: my design seems suck may be i will make it beautiful
[08:20:39] <Cork> (this goes in circles...)
[08:20:51] <taplar> hellyeah: that question is saying that they can select multiple and they should not be able to
[08:20:56] <taplar> the answer is showing how to fix that
[08:21:05] <Cork> Lebbe: the flow is this: 1. you fetch the text content of the html resource
[08:21:23] <Cork> 2. the content is then appended/replacing the content of some part of the page / dom
[08:21:30] <hellyeah> same name attribute?
[08:21:36] <Cork> 3. the browser parses the html, and finds the <link> element
[08:21:46] <taplar> yes, like i said, radio buttons with the same name are exclusive
[08:21:51] <Cork> 4. the browser fetches the stylesheet and adds it to the doms stylesheet list
[08:22:09] <taplar> your providing 'states' for the shared name
[08:22:28] <hellyeah> so i should use checkboxes
[08:22:28] <Cork> Lebbe: the web isn't built to dynamically style things by adding stylesheets
[08:22:39] <taplar> if you want multiple selections, yes
[08:22:39] <hellyeah> DAMN
[08:22:49] <Cork> it is VERY inefficient, especially as it forces the entire page to update
[08:23:03] <Mark_____> can anyone suggest me any good name for a design company?
[08:23:08] <Cork> (cause new rules are loaded so every element has to be checked if they are affected)
[08:23:41] <taplar> lol, seriously?
[08:24:08] <hellyeah> what
[08:24:11] <taplar> not you
[08:24:16] <hellyeah> okay
[08:24:21] <hellyeah> xD
[08:25:53] <lemonsparrow> I have an array of json object.. how can I add an id property to each object with value from 1.. to size of array ?
[08:26:13] <Cork> lemonsparrow: json object or an array of objects?
[08:26:20] <Cork> meaning an array of objects or an array of strings
[08:26:25] <lemonsparrow> array of json object
[08:26:32] <lemonsparrow> response of an api
[08:26:38] <Cork> so ["{}", "{}"] ?
[08:26:41] <Lebbe> Cork: thanks for the explanation
[08:26:55] <Cork> "{}", "{}" <-- json object
[08:27:00] <lemonsparrow> I want to add id field to each object and with value.. 1 to size of array
[08:27:02] <Cork> {}, {} <-- normal objects
[08:27:05] <taplar> {} is just an object
[08:27:25] <taplar> 'json' may have ben the source that was parsed to get the object, but it's just an object
[08:27:37] <Cork> unless it isn't parsed ya
[08:27:42] <taplar> ^
[08:28:03] <lemonsparrow> ok..
[08:28:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if it is an array of objects just loop it and add the index
[08:28:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork, how
[08:28:20] <lemonsparrow> is there a shorthand ?
[08:28:37] <taplar> !jquery each
[08:28:43] <taplar> @j each
[08:28:47] <taplar> bah
[08:29:00] <taplar> hah, b-ot isn't even in here
[08:29:08] <Cork> something like for(var i=0,length=arr.length;i < length;i++) { arr[i]id = i; }
[08:29:13] <Cork> should work nicely
[08:29:20] <Cork> opps
[08:29:27] <Cork> * for(var i=0,length=arr.length;i < length;i++) { arr[i].id = i; }
[08:29:30] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2FforEach
[08:30:25] <lemonsparrow> newArr = arr.map((obj, ind) => Object.assign({}, obj, {id: ind + 1}));
[08:30:25] <Cork> ah, you wanted 1+ so  for(var i=0,length=arr.length;i < length;i++) { arr[i].id = i + 1; }
[08:30:48] <Cork> that is a much more expensive solution
[08:30:53] <lemonsparrow> array.forEach(function(item, index) { item.id = index+1; }); ?
[08:31:16] <Cork> that one is more expensive, but at least not creating so much gc
[08:31:27] <skione> hi, I have an issue where I have a table and when you click in the table it replaces the contents with an input box. It works but if you click in the box it triggers the original click action even though I removed the class
[08:31:49] <Cork> (the later is an ok solution the first you made is not)
[08:31:50] <skione> the weird things is I have basically the same function for the next cell but instead of an unput it replaces it with a select
[08:32:01] <taplar> skione: what element is the click event bound to?
[08:32:08] <skione> the td
[08:32:22] <taplar> so you'll need to either remove the binding or make it a delegate binding
[08:32:28] <taplar> the binding still exists until you remove it
[08:32:44] <skione> how do I remove a binding?
[08:32:51] <taplar> you can use off()
[08:32:57] <taplar> i would recommend a delegate though
[08:32:59] <taplar> cleaner
[08:33:51] <skione> yea I have to re-attach the binding after the field is changed
[08:33:52] <Cork> and more efficient
[08:34:00] <skione> I am not that well versed in using delegation
[08:34:28] <Cork> skione: $('parent selector').on('click', 'selector matching the child', func)
[08:34:32] <Cork> it is as simple as that
[08:34:50] <taplar> and then to invalidate it, you just make the child selector not match anymore
[08:34:58] <Cork> find a static parent and give it a second argument to .on that matches the real target
[08:35:12] <Cork> toggleClass ftw
[08:36:13] <taplar> or if he surrounded his text with a span, if he replaced the span with just the input, that would break the matcher too
[08:36:40] <skione> ok let me give it a shot, thanks Cork
[08:36:57] * Cork forwards most of the credits to taplar 
[08:37:08] <taplar> wha'd i do?
[08:37:12] <taplar> :)
[08:37:37] <taplar> i seriously keep thinking about writing up a little reference page just for delegates to forward people too when they ask
[08:37:44] <Cork> taplar: never question free credits :)
[08:37:50] <taplar> true
[08:38:24] <Cork> taplar: ya, it annoys me that they put that BIG scary "this is superseeded" warning on .delegate in api.jquery.com
[08:38:41] <Cork> it was a good page, but now new users just gets hung up on that text
[08:38:51] <Cork> and .on is too focused on normal event handlers
[08:39:44] <hellyeah> superseeded
[08:39:48] <hellyeah> what does that mean
[08:39:53] <taplar> also I see robert get hit with it a lot, he'll point someone there, and they'll skim it and miss the delegate part.  kinda a TL;DR situation
[08:39:57] <Cork> the worst part is that ppl read superseeded as "deprecated"
[08:40:10] <Cork> and that is very very wrong
[08:40:35] <Cork> hellyeah: that the new "preferred" way of doing delecation is part of .on
[08:40:57] <Cork> why they make such a big deal of it when .delegate is a one liner is beyond me
[08:42:03] <hellyeah> .on is preferred now right
[08:42:14] <Cork> well on is what everything uses
[08:42:31] <Cork> delegate just translates the arguments and forwards them to .on
[08:42:50] <Cork> .delegate(selector, event, func) => .on(event, selector, func)
[08:44:04] <hellyeah> or
[08:44:17] <hellyeah> selector.on(event, func)
[08:44:29] <Cork> that is the old .bind
[08:44:33] <Cork> not delegate
[08:44:50] <Cork> it does the same translation
[08:55:41] <hellyeah> hey
[08:56:16] <hellyeah> you can click checkboxes but when you click second checkbox. Seems like it wiped the result of first checkbox how can i avoid this? http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/101/
[08:57:04] <Cork> hellyeah: all the checkboxes has the same name
[08:57:37] <hellyeah> hmm is this problem? Lemme see
[08:57:41] <hellyeah> well sorry
[08:57:46] <hellyeah> ofc it is problem :D
[09:00:38] <hellyeah> still same thing happening http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/103/
[09:00:58] <hellyeah> when i check green then orange i want to see result of both.
[09:01:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:01:31] <taplar> your only displaying based on what was clicked
[09:01:40] <taplar> not collectively what is checked
[09:01:48] <hellyeah> yeah it came to my mind
[09:01:53] <hellyeah> now
[09:02:12] <hellyeah> what should i do can you gve me any tips?
[09:02:28] <taplar> find the checkboxes that are checked, and filter on their values
[09:03:05] <taplar> there is a ':checked' meta operator you can use fwiw
[09:03:15] <hellyeah> i suppose this.value get the value of clicked checkbox
[09:03:36] <taplar> whatever 'this' is
[09:03:44] <hellyeah> okey i see
[09:03:51] <hellyeah> get the value of checked checkbox
[09:04:00] <hellyeah> i know :checked
[09:04:03] <hellyeah> just a sec
[09:04:17] <taplar> also you have a logic flaw in your event
[09:04:32] <robhol> my brain is crying
[09:04:33] <taplar> your basing it off of click, but the click could have unchecked the box
[09:04:38] <hellyeah> floaw
[09:04:47] <hellyeah> yeah
[09:04:52] <hellyeah> thats another problem
[09:05:25] <hellyeah> let me see what i can do
[09:05:54] <taplar> robhol: cheery up.  it's friday.  happy happy joy joy!
[09:06:00] <taplar> lmao, cherry
[09:06:04] <taplar> blah
[09:06:17] <robhol> did you just typo the typo?
[09:06:27] <robhol> :D
[09:06:32] <taplar> leave me alone.  i'm paying attention to my bacon and eggs
[09:07:19] <hellyeah> i like eggs and cheese
[09:09:01] <Sourcey> wht is the equalent to .= in jquery?
[09:09:07] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Hmm... I got an update button, and x levels up, I got a container classed item-row. console.log($(this).closest('.item-row')); Is there any reason this outputs length 0?
[09:09:07] <Sourcey> like adding more to a variable (string)
[09:09:09] <taplar> +=
[09:09:31] <hellyeah> += didnt work in javascript
[09:09:52] <taplar> it depends on if your working with raw strings or not
[09:10:15] <hellyeah> actually it didnt work for integer
[09:10:21] <hellyeah> i += 1 should work
[09:10:35] <robhol> I find that hard to believe...
[09:10:36] <hellyeah> i didnt see any lang that doesnt understand it before
[09:10:41] <Sourcey> this is a string im building during a .each()
[09:10:47] <taplar> you have to be careful with += 1
[09:10:49] <hellyeah> try this
[09:10:56] <taplar> especially if your intermixing types
[09:10:57] <hellyeah> taplar: why is that?
[09:10:58] <robhol> >> a=0; a+=3; a
[09:11:05] <robhol> meh.
[09:11:11] <hellyeah> intermixing type what is that
[09:11:26] <taplar> behaviour varies if your appending strings and numbers
[09:11:30] <hellyeah> >> a=0; a+=3; console.log(a)
[09:11:35] <hellyeah> b> a=0; a+=3; console.log(a)
[09:11:35] <taplar> vs strings to strings, and numbers to numbers
[09:11:41] <taplar> one being not an append ata ll
[09:11:52] <hellyeah> >> 2 + '3'
[09:14:04] <hellyeah> taplar: this logic should work http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/108/ what am i doing wrong here?
[09:14:39] <taplar> there are potentially multiple checked
[09:14:50] <taplar> so the .val() off of that is a problem
[09:14:52] <robhol> my eyes D:
[09:14:56] <taplar> ll
[09:14:58] <taplar> lol
[09:15:18] <hellyeah> .val() is problem
[09:15:29] <hellyeah> damn
[09:15:37] <taplar> also don't wrap to get is checked
[09:15:42] <taplar> just do this.checked
[09:18:38] <hellyeah> actually i need take breathe can you give me small tips about this taplar http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/112/
[09:22:02] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/u1pdhk8c/113/ added a short little comment block in there
[09:22:51] <Z4sk4> please, how can i dowload a info that show a jquery in the website with curl or wget?
[09:23:53] <Uhkis> what..?
[09:24:47] <hellyeah> i will check taplar thanks
[09:25:33] <Z4sk4> Uhkis,  i wanna download the source of a website, but can download me the info that show the jquery code...
[09:25:45] <Z4sk4> but i cant*
[09:51:17] <VectorX> so i have an iframe and a modal window that pops up when you enter a page to fill a form, the once submitted, the js adds a src youtube url to the iframe which places, if you go back and come forward to the page, you get the modal and the video plays in the background, whats the event i can use to take out the src from the iframe when you leave or come to the page in that manner
[09:51:32] <VectorX> ie, using the back or forward
[09:51:37] <VectorX> .unload didnt work
[10:13:12] <notchris> How to make the actual time 5PM with jquery so I can go home?
[10:13:31] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Try closing your eyes for 50 minutes
[10:13:50] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Make a loop that will run for 50 minutes, tell your boss "it's running", "I'm waiting"
[10:14:16] <notchris> Zero_Zip_Zilch: notchris.hide();
[10:14:16] <notchris> ?
[10:14:52] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> I mean that would hide you, assuming you can find your element from within the browser
[10:15:02] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Wouldn't change actual time tho
[10:16:14] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> If I got an update button, and x levels up, I got a container classed item-row. console.log($(this).closest('.item-row')); Is there any reason that outputs length 0?
[10:18:13] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[10:20:40] <xec> it's a javascript keyword
[10:20:50] <xec> do I get a prize?
[10:23:49] <lemonsparrow> I have an array of json object.. how to remove an object from the array by id.. ? any shorthand ?
[10:24:10] <decx> array.slice(index,1)
[10:26:01] <decx> what a neat typo
[10:26:05] <decx> it's splice of course ^^
[10:28:56] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> taplar, it's inside an on click for a button
[10:29:23] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Which works just fine, cus $(this).closest('.edit') (which is just one level below item-row) works
[10:30:44] <shoky_> if length is 0 then it wasn't found
[10:34:01] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Exactly. And the question is how that can be. I mean, it doesn't really feel like it makes any sense: http://jsbin.com/feqobomopu/edit?html
[10:36:41] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> What's weird is, it works just fine in jsbin when I add the function. Ugh... I'll have to dig deeper I guess
[10:39:24] <shoky_> it can be if you have a typo, or if the DOM is not in the state you think it is, at the time you're running the query
[10:41:14] <shoky_> also it's safer to actually log the .length property instead of the full object
[10:41:32] <shoky_> or well, both
[10:42:27] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Omg...
[10:42:31] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Okay, so here's the thing
[10:42:59] <lemonsparrow> why am I getting the error here //Cannot read property 'originHostnames' of undefined https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/6b1d2812f0210059c3f8 line 3 does return true :
[10:43:17] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> $(this) within AJAX in an on('click', function(){/* */}) != $(this) outside of that AJAX in the same on click function....
[10:43:35] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> For future reference, for whoever encounters this
[10:43:56] <shoky_> Zero_Zip_Zilch: yes, "this" can change in any function call
[10:44:09] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Haha aye, noticed
[10:44:36] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> So the question is what the best way to preserve the button element is. Make another variable of it?
[10:45:07] <shoky_> var elem = this;  outside the inner function works
[10:45:14] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Aight, sweet. Thanks
[10:46:09] <shoky_> lemonsparrow: same issue,  "this" changes in function calls, like the function you're passing to .forEach
[10:46:41] <decx> it's a thismas miracle!
[10:46:43] <shoky_> lemonsparrow: since you're using es6 already you can mitigate this by just having that function be a fat-arrow function
[10:47:34] <lemonsparrow> shoky_, can you show code pls
[10:47:39] <lemonsparrow> shoky_, I'm not sure
[10:48:20] <shoky_> lemonsparrow:  .forEach((item, index) => {  ...  })
[10:48:48] <shoky_> lemonsparrow: but uhh i see you're modifying the array inside the loop. could be messy..
[10:48:56] <lemonsparrow> shoky_, yep
[10:50:00] <lemonsparrow> shoky_, can u show me the correct way to rewrite the whole function pls
[10:50:42] <shoky_> lemonsparrow:  this.originHostnames.forEach((item, index) => { ... same thing you had inside before ... });
[10:51:20] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Eureka, finally
[10:51:32] <lemonsparrow> shoky_, ok
[10:51:45] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Only took me ~6 hours to manage to get a field to change on an update with AJAX
[10:51:52] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> And here I thought I was a veteran
[10:52:01] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Everything to not have to use 15 billion selectors
[10:52:05] <shoky_> learning javascript would help ;p
[10:59:40] <VectorX> what is the equivilent of jQuery(window).scrollTop() max height just to get the value
[11:00:22] <decx> max heighT?
[11:02:12] <Zero_Zip_Zilch> Opinion time: when making an AJAX validation error, what'd you suggest? Making the input field change color and get a placeholder saying required, a bootstrap alert box above the form saying [field] is required, or some other indicator next to the field?
[11:07:01] <taplar> red border on input(s) with a message up top saying "errors occured.  please hover over fields for more informaiton".  fields having title giving relevant error information
[11:14:04] <robertmaxrees> quiet morning
[11:14:44] <Maxou88> wha mean this plz : Note that if you use Row selection with bootstrap theme, the css class to toggle must be active and not selected.  from here : https://datatables.net/examples/api/select_row.html I use bootstrap and i have some issues with this functionality in my table. I can selected onli 1 line on 2.
[11:15:51] <Maxou88> wirds thing when i do a count of selected
[11:15:53] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to use active as your class and not selected.
[11:16:04] <Maxou88> I can select  but i can't see it
[11:16:27] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that text anywhere on the linked page fwiw.
[11:16:38] <Maxou88> in the commment sorry
[11:16:45] <mikes000> I am looking to us the .ajexSetup function to modify subsequent requests. The docs say it is strongly recommend against using this API and to define a simple plugin to do so. I have been looking around for some tips on how to do this but havent had much luck, could any one help provide me some direction?
[11:16:55] <Maxou88> https://datatables.net/examples/api/select_row.html
[11:17:07] <robertmaxrees> lol that's the same link - i see it now.
[11:17:19] <robertmaxrees> and that's a comment from another user.
[11:17:32] <Maxou88> ye !
[11:17:42] <robertmaxrees> they mean that instead of, say,  $(this).toggleClass('selected');, you use  $(this).toggleClass('active');
[11:18:55] <Maxou88> ok seems working :D
[11:19:23] <robertmaxrees> in those js examples they use selected - you want to use active in those cases.  that's what that comment says.
[11:19:24] <Maxou88> but it's not very better
[11:20:08] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:20:27] <Maxou88> i always dont see 1 line on 2
[11:20:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what that means.
[11:20:46] <Maxou88> *dont see if selected or not ^^
[11:21:00] <robertmaxrees> a standalone example might be a good idea since this channel isn't datatables support.
[11:21:11] <Maxou88> yeah ok thx for your help
[11:21:14] <robertmaxrees> so having something we can play with would be helpful.  otherwise, i'd go to their forums.
[11:26:20] <lemonsparrow> how to remove object from array whose property cableName is '' ?  this.array.splice(this.array.cableName==='', 1); is this correct
[11:26:32] <VectorX> decx yeah jQuery(window).scrollTop() if you scroll to the bottom you get a value, i need to get that
[11:26:49] <decx> window.scrollHeight
[11:28:02] <decx> wait, should be body
[11:28:05] <decx> yeah document.body
[11:28:24] <decx> there's some crossbrowser shenanigans too
[11:30:10] <VectorX> im not getting anything, its undefined
[11:31:25] <VectorX> shoudnt jQuery("body").scrollHeight work ?
[11:31:54] <decx> $('body').height() should suffice
[11:32:23] <decx> scrollHeight is a native property and not attached to the jquery object
[11:33:13] <decx> with crossbrowser you have document.body.scrollHeight/offsetHeight/clientHeight and then the same fro document.documentElement
[11:33:34] <decx> no wonder jquery is popular ^^
[11:35:12] <VectorX> $(window).scrollTop() gives me 983 and $(window).height() 871
[11:39:36] <Maxou88> Datatables is so good :D
[11:51:48] <Pazician> Is anyone familiar with json?
[11:51:59] <taplar> jason?
[11:52:17] <zzaichik> jason's pretty cool, sure!
[11:52:33] <Pazician> JSON, cmon...
[11:52:53] <taplar> what's the q?
[11:53:29] <Pazician> I'm trying to load the data from the JSON file, but it doesn't really work out for me... http://pastebin.com/j6i4KRr6
[11:54:44] <taplar> which part isn't working and what does the json look like?
[11:55:36] <mrwindupbird> d03
[11:55:59] <Pazician> taplar: This is how the data looks like: http://pastebin.com/jE4cQUa3 It's basically not loading the data, I can visit the file if I go localhost:port/js/file
[11:56:30] <taplar> one thing that's not an array
[11:56:35] <taplar> it's missing the outer []
[11:57:03] <Pazician> Could you rewrite it for me?
[11:57:16] <taplar> just put the whole thing in between [], heh
[11:57:23] <Pazician> taplar: Oh, alright
[11:58:12] <Pazician> taplar: Boom, thanks! It worked!
[11:58:31] <Pazician> taplar: But the title isn't showing tho
[11:59:24] <taplar> i dunno about google maps api, but you can console your data.title to see that it is pulling it in
[11:59:59] <Pazician> taplar: Alright, thank you
[12:00:58] <Pazician> taplar: I get an error when I do data.title or json.title "ReferenceError: data is not defined"
[12:01:41] <taplar> where did you put your console?
[12:02:11] <Pazician> In the console, dev tools in the browser
[12:02:18] <taplar> no no no
[12:02:23] <Pazician> Hehe
[12:02:26] <taplar> you need to put it in your code
[12:02:31] <Pazician> Oh, alright
[12:02:39] <taplar> that variable is local so it's not going to exist after the function finishes
[12:02:57] <taplar> or more precisely, even if it did still exist you won't have access to it
[12:03:19] <Pazician> taplar: Alright, should I put it inside the to for-loop?
[12:03:29] <taplar> yup
[12:04:01] <Pazician> Alright, I get it printed out but the title isn't showing in the description...
[12:04:37] <taplar> so now you get to figure out if your correctly using the Marker object and what not
[12:04:42] <Pazician> Oh, hold - maybe I could give it all the text inside the description, right?
[12:04:51] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[12:28:25] <taplar> oh adele.... cheer up.
[12:30:32] <durwasa> taplar_lunch, , sorry i slept early last night ... :P gmt +5:30 here at India ... https://bpaste.net/show/ab91edbb35ee this is a good way to perform the keyvalue function ?
[12:35:54] <taplar_lunch> eh! :)
[12:36:04] <taplar_lunch> let me se
[12:36:44] <taplar_lunch> i'd put an if around your mail options creation and your send mail
[12:36:56] <taplar_lunch> check that volunteer_mail[req.body.volunteer.toString()] exists
[12:37:43] <durwasa> ok like a try catch ?
[12:37:46] <durwasa> taplar_lunch,
[12:38:14] <taplar_lunch> no like, if (volunteer_mail[req.body.volunteer.toString()] !== undefined)
[12:39:01] <taplar_lunch> if it's undefined that is an error, but not an Error so a try catch wouldn't inheriently save you
[12:41:03] <taplar_lunch> and if it is undefined you might want to return a 400
[12:46:50] <durwasa> https://bpaste.net/show/18d9b907d01d taplar_lunch ... is this solution very naive ?
[12:47:45] <taplar_lunch> your still trying to send an email regardless of if an email was found or not
[12:47:54] <taplar_lunch> also does alert() work on a back end script?
[12:50:13] <taplar_lunch> oh
[12:50:24] <taplar_lunch> and that's also outside your request endpoint so that's awkward
[12:51:10] <johndoe2> any ideas on how to provide options to the hammerjs wrapper for jquery to add pinch and rotate?
[12:53:26] <johndoe2> they're called recognizers upon inspecting $("#myid").data("hammer");, and these two are disabled by default but I have no idea how to come up with the syntax to bypass that
[12:56:42] <taplar_lunch> i assume you browsed this page? http://hammerjs.github.io/touch-action/
[12:57:31] <johndoe2> yeah and vanilla code works fine but I can't figure out how the wrapper passes those options to Hammer https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hammerjs/jquery.hammer.js/master/jquery.hammer.js
[12:59:08] <johndoe2> basically I need to pass Hammer.Pinch() to Hammer.Manager() but I can't see the wrapper accessing the manager
[12:59:12] <johndoe2> maybe they didn't include it.
[13:00:14] <taplar_lunch> on the demo page that page links to there's some in page scripting at the bottom that might(?) be informative
[13:00:26] <durwasa> taplar_lunch, ok i guess i got the error... before the mail is processed and ready to be transported I should check whether the mail is valid or not.. thankyou for your time :) :) Probably I should focus on the new discussion Hammer.io
[13:01:18] <taplar_lunch> durwasa: it's all good.  i'm 90% guessing at the hammer question, heh.  and we don't limit talks to one convo anyway
[13:03:09] <durwasa> ok taplar_lunch :) :) bt me asking idiotic questions would limit the talk anyways :P :P bt still for one last time i came up with this :: https://bpaste.net/show/fb52d0cdba3e
[13:04:02] <taplar_lunch> ah, so if it errors it passes in an e variable?
[13:05:40] <durwasa> yes however the last else is not required just checked on the console ... it takes care of the undefined email id as well ... probably the designers of nodemailer took care of it taplar_lunch
[13:06:11] <taplar_lunch> cool, one thing, i don't see where your defining 'mailTo' anymore
[13:06:49] <taplar_lunch> or was that to force the error case?
[13:08:04] <placidb> I need a little help understanding why the z-index re-stacking of the elements on http://vriesia.greyhat.nl/prospect/carrousel.php is being done 'mid animation'. any pointers would be appreciated!
[13:10:09] <taplar> is the logic in your common.js.php?  what part does the object placement from front to end?
[13:11:16] <placidb> taplar: the js is only there to set the top, left, width and height attributes of the images
[13:11:26] <placidb> all of the transitioning is done using css3
[13:12:19] <durwasa> taplar, sorry missed that one :P
[13:12:26] <placidb> the items are 're-stacked' by updating their z-index on line 52
[13:12:58] <placidb> 51 actually (there is some php in there as well)
[13:16:23] <taplar> so to make sure i'm understanding the issue
[13:16:51] <taplar> the issue is that the image that is moved from left most to right most is appearing on top of the previously right most image until the animation stops?
[13:20:22] <durwasa> taplar, even i think the same ... inorder to give that stack animation feel the last-1 should override the top-1 ... bt lets see wat placidb has to say...
[13:22:44] <johndoe2> http://jsfiddle.net/5cnvc5dh/ if anyone is interested in helping me figure out how to pass options to hammer to enable pinch...:)
[13:23:34] <johndoe2> otherwise I'll just go back to vanilla and retype the same stuff over and over again for each element I want to bind a trigger to. heh
[13:23:45] <duch_kazatel> johndoe2 wut
[13:23:51] <duch_kazatel> what's your question?
[13:24:10] <johndoe2> I don't know how to get the jquery wrapper to pass the option to enable PINCH which is disabled by default in hammer.js
[13:24:29] <johndoe2> this is how you do it in vanilla js: http://codepen.io/jtangelder/pen/zKHDk
[13:24:54] <duch_kazatel> try again - what are you trying to do?
[13:25:00] <duch_kazatel> bind to the pinch event?
[13:25:04] <johndoe2> yes
[13:26:32] <johndoe2> the hammer({}) accepts options but I don't know what to give it to have Manager.add([pinch]);
[13:26:54] <duch_kazatel> that's how you do it - http://hammerjs.github.io/jquery-plugin/
[13:26:57] <duch_kazatel> xhttp://hammerjs.github.io/jquery-plugin/
[13:27:32] <johndoe2> do you see anything I don't?
[13:30:17] <durwasa> taplar, i dont knw how to test it bt is the solution right? Like if we add the lastLeft at the end ie once the animation is over then a appearing lastLeft would provide the soln ?
[13:30:55] <duch_kazatel> johndoe2 try just addclass insted of toggleclass
[13:32:22] <johndoe2> duch_kazatel that's not the issue. focus on hammer({}), that's the only way the wrapper seems to send options to Hammer(). That's my only issue, I don't know how to send it Hammer.Manager().add(Hammer.Pinch());
[13:32:38] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:32:44] <duch_kazatel> i think you're confused, but okay.
[13:32:46] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[13:32:55] <duch_kazatel> sorry for trying to help.
[13:33:56] <johndoe2> duch_kazatel :) that easy huh
[13:34:22] <johndoe2> anyways I apologize, it seems I came across as a buttface, which was not my intention. Thanks for trying to help, it is appreciated.
[13:36:26] <duch_kazatel> did you open your console?
[13:36:51] <johndoe2> yes
[13:37:28] <johndoe2> check out the warning http://jsfiddle.net/5cnvc5dh/1/
[13:37:50] <johndoe2> that shows you the recognizers, an array of 7 types, two of which are disabled by default
[13:38:08] <duch_kazatel> you're not paying attention - that's how how you load things into jsfiddle.
[13:38:13] <duch_kazatel> you can't link to the files on github,.
[13:38:40] <duch_kazatel> you need to use rawgit for that part.
[13:39:46] <johndoe2> duch_kazatel you think Hammer isn't loading?
[13:39:55] <duch_kazatel> i can see it isn't in chrome ;)
[13:41:13] <yottabyte> if your jquery is loaded at the end of your html file, and you have another <script></script> below it with some jquery, you don't need $(document).ready, do you?
[13:41:17] <yottabyte> or is it just good practice to have?
[13:41:23] <taplar> yottabyte: nope
[13:41:41] <duch_kazatel> yottabyte document ready is only really helpful if your code is in the head or anywhere before </body>
[13:41:42] <taplar> not necessary at that point
[13:41:51] <duch_kazatel> document ready also has nothing to do with scripts loading.
[13:41:52] <duch_kazatel> fwiw.
[13:44:00] <yottabyte> oh, right
[13:45:05] <VectorX> is there a way to detect if a user got to page via the forward button ?
[13:45:12] <durwasa> jst a follow up Q  if the code is not inline and the script has been linked to some external js above <body> in the head section then why it is mandatory to put the code around a $(document).ready ?
[13:45:32] <duch_kazatel> VectorX are you using pushstates?
[13:45:38] <VectorX> no
[13:45:42] <VectorX> just browser back and forward
[13:45:44] <duch_kazatel> VectorX then nope.
[13:45:59] <duch_kazatel> durwasa because the page hasn't rendered yet.
[13:46:11] <robertmaxrees> durwasa the DOM doesn't yet exist.
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> so your js can't work.
[13:47:24] <robertmaxrees> well, actually, it can, but only if it doesn't try to access the DOM
[13:48:17] <durwasa> so if I enclose it after the body tag still I need to curl around $(document).ready(function() {} ? @robertmaxrees
[13:48:26] <robertmaxrees> you can't put it after the body tag.
[13:48:35] <robertmaxrees> err, the closing body tag.
[13:48:41] <robertmaxrees> and it would need to be right before the closing body tag.
[13:49:06] <robertmaxrees> basically, if your js is the last thing before </body>, you don't need it.
[13:49:07] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees I'm not sure why that is the case for you, but here it is pulled from another place http://jsfiddle.net/5cnvc5dh/2/
[13:49:08] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you do.
[13:49:09] <durwasa> yes sorry robertmaxrees i meant </body> :P
[13:49:24] <durwasa> okkkk robertmaxrees :) :)
[13:49:25] <durwasa> gotit
[13:50:08] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 mime types.  and what happens if you do this: http://jsfiddle.net/5cnvc5dh/4/ ?
[13:52:25] <VectorX> the problem i am having is i am setting a iframe src to a youtube embed link, via a jquery on another action, but if the user back via back button and forward again to the page, iframe still has that value set and starts playing
[13:52:41] <VectorX> which it should not, it should have a empty src again
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> VectorX https://www.google.com/#q=javascript+detect+back+forward+buttons
[13:54:27] <durwasa> VectorX, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16612210/how-to-tell-whether-the-forward-or-backward-button-was-pressed-using-the-popstat
[13:54:32] <VectorX> robertmaxrees yeah ive been going thru a whole bunch of those
[13:54:38] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees it binds to the pinch method of Hammer, but it doesn't actually trigger because Hammer has that disabled by default. Does that make sense?
[13:55:13] <johndoe2> if for example I have "pinch swipeleft" the function will trigger when I swipe left but not when I pinch
[13:55:14] <VectorX> durwasa it would have to be compatible with non html5 browsers aswell
[13:55:45] <Woet> VectorX: what are you actually doing? why do you have an iframe with a youtube embed?
[13:55:45] <VectorX> so looking around ie7 ish
[13:55:59] <robertmaxrees> Woet because that's the default youtube embed.
[13:56:05] <Woet> oh, is it?
[13:56:07] <Woet> that sucks
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 your assumption seems wrong - the docs say otherwise.
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> but meh.  i don't have a device to test with atm sooo good luck :)
[13:58:27] <VectorX> here is a example of the issue, http://bit.ly/1lnjPQI click on the first image below Webinars
[13:58:37] <robertmaxrees> VectorX i gave you a link.
[13:59:36] <VectorX> robertmaxrees the google serp right ?
[14:00:42] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees I'm not assuming, I read it in the docs, looking for it now. Until then, if you look at the $("#loop-container").data("hammer") output in the warning item in your browser's console you'll see that the recognizers array has everything else enabled outside of pinch and rotate. The explanation I believe was that they disable default behavior (so you can't scroll on a mobile device anymore unless you manually provide touchAction:
[14:00:43] <johndoe2>  'pan-y' as an option)
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> got it - you want to set enable: true; on the pinch option.  you're not trying to add it.  my bad.
[14:02:54] <johndoe2> yep. no problem, it's my terminology.
[14:05:06] <notchris> Is there any way to pass a value to a page without a cookie / url parameter?
[14:05:40] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 http://jsfiddle.net/5cnvc5dh/5/
[14:05:50] <taplar> ohhhhh, must refrain from smartelic comment
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> notchris hidden inputs?
[14:06:15] <taplar> keyboards
[14:06:16] <taplar> dang!
[14:06:16] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean like, just the page itself.
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> johndoe2 your issue was you were trying to set that option in an event handler that was never firing.
[14:07:02] <Panason> hello guys!
[14:07:37] <Panason> I want to know if here are somebody that does a simple jquery work for pay for it?
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> Panason wrong channel for that.
[14:07:56] <johndoe2> robertmaxrees exactly, because I had no idea how to set it to true before instantiating hammer(), but now I understand how to do that. :) Thank you very much!
[14:07:59] <Panason> what happen is I don't have time
[14:08:10] <Panason> where can I find that?
[14:08:13] <robertmaxrees> Panason bummer - go to a freelance channel.
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> not sure what all is out there, but you can search the network to find the right place.
[14:08:44] <z1haze> for a not statement in jquery can i do if($!('.class').length) ?
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that doesn't make any sense.
[14:09:11] <z1haze> hmm
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> $! isn't anything, and jquery isn't a language ;)
[14:09:24] <z1haze> thats why im asking how to do it
[14:09:33] <z1haze> can you not invery if statements
[14:09:36] <z1haze> invert*
[14:09:40] <robertmaxrees> sure you can
[14:09:43] <z1haze> if ($('.streams_insert .streamer[data-author="' + channel_name + '"][data-online="online"]').length) {
[14:09:44] <robertmaxrees> swap your ! and $
[14:09:46] <z1haze> i want opposide
[14:09:51] <z1haze> oh alright
[14:09:54] <z1haze> i was close
[14:09:58] <robertmaxrees> $().length returns a number.
[14:10:02] <robertmaxrees> you want to negate that return.
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> $!.() isn't anything - that's trying to call the $! function
[14:10:25] <z1haze> i only want to do something if there is no length
[14:10:44] <z1haze> right now i just have a open if {} and then i use the else {
[14:10:53] <z1haze> trying to rework it, but i such at js stuff
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> right - what i told you will work.
[14:10:57] <z1haze> ok
[14:11:06] <z1haze> the swapping the $ and ! right?
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:11:11] <z1haze> cool
[14:11:13] <z1haze> thanks again
[14:11:38] <z1haze> and for a single line if statement i dont need {} right
[14:12:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd use it anyway.
[14:12:39] <robertmaxrees> hard to read otherwise.
[14:12:42] <z1haze> alright
[14:13:39] <z1haze> one last question (at least for now) can i call a function anywhere in a js file, even if the definition if the function is after i call it? i know in php you can just write the function and call it from anywhere in the file, i dunno about client side stuff though
[14:13:54] <robertmaxrees> it depends on how you defined the function.
[14:14:04] <z1haze> function mini_stream_refresh() { ... }
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> you can theoretically do that, but i'm not a fan.
[14:14:17] <z1haze> mini_stream_refresh();
[14:14:25] <robertmaxrees> define your functions up front and then use them.
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer using var someName = function() {}
[14:14:57] <z1haze> that calls it while defining it?
[14:15:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:15:06] <robertmaxrees> that defines it.
[14:15:11] <robertmaxrees> alternative to function someName() {}
[14:15:12] <z1haze> ohh i get it
[14:15:15] <z1haze> juist a differnt way i see
[14:15:21] <z1haze> yea i understand
[14:15:47] <z1haze> well thats neither here nor there, but as far as the placing the definition and the call it can be anywhere right
[14:16:10] <robertmaxrees> that's actually relevant becuase that can change what you can do.
[14:16:10] <z1haze> i tend to find the flow of events easier if all of my calls are at the top, then the functions below, at least thats how i write my php
[14:16:22] <robertmaxrees> and that's backwards from how I do it.
[14:29:30] <taplar> i just go alphabetical, heh
[14:35:54] <z1haze> you can use .length to count the number of elements within a div right?
[14:36:26] <taplar> sure
[14:36:40] <taplar> if you select the children or do children() off the parent
[14:36:43] <z1haze> oh wait i know what i problem is
[14:36:54] <z1haze> how can i say wait until this is fully loaded before you check
[14:36:55] <placidb> taplar: sorry, was afk for a minute. no the issue is that in latest chrome (win 8.1), the updated z-index seems to take effect during the top/left/width/height transitions
[14:37:08] <z1haze> window.load()?
[14:37:08] <taplar> huh
[14:37:35] <taplar> how is it being loaded?
[14:37:41] <placidb> and I would like the underlying items to update their z-index before any transitioning occurs
[14:37:45] <z1haze> its populated from a js function
[14:37:58] <z1haze> its making api calls and populating a streamer module
[14:38:17] <taplar> in that case you'd wait until all that is done
[14:38:23] <z1haze> and i have a loading div that takes place until its finished, and if nothing loads i just change it to no streamers online
[14:38:28] <z1haze> right, but how do i do that
[14:38:51] <taplar> you can attach a done() to a deferred object, which ajax calls are
[14:39:22] <z1haze> well all that stuff takes place inside of a function i call
[14:40:23] <taplar> you can't change that function?
[14:40:29] <placidb> taplar: actually firefox is behaving a little worse even. the rightmost item that newly appears only pops into z-index position after all transitions are done
[14:40:53] <z1haze> i could i just dont really know how to do what you're suggesting, im still learning a lot of this
[14:41:25] <taplar> z1haze: if you can put your function in a fiddle for us to see we might could offer more guidance
[14:42:07] <z1haze> sure
[14:42:44] <taplar> placidb: i noticed that stuff was firing on transition start or something (have the code window closed now)
[14:43:19] <taplar> if there's a transition stop event or whatever, what you might could do is do the detach in the start and in the stop do the re-attaching
[14:46:21] <z1haze> it looks pretty rough in the fiddle, but the idea is there: http://jsfiddle.net/Lsd76jdx/1/
[14:47:19] <taplar> so your doing an ajax request per stream
[14:47:27] <taplar> and you want to count children once all those are done?
[14:47:30] <z1haze> basically the .steams_loading is there while they load in then i want it to disappear, in the event there are no live feeds, we will display no online
[14:47:34] <z1haze> yea
[14:47:35] <z1haze> well
[14:47:38] <z1haze> i just want to know when its finished
[14:47:43] <taplar> ah
[14:47:44] <z1haze> before i count it
[14:47:58] <taplar> there's a when function you can use, hold on
[14:48:00] <z1haze> right now, im counting it with .length but its counting before the function finishes
[14:48:14] <z1haze> so i get zero every time
[14:48:20] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[14:49:06] <z1haze> cool, i think. let me see if i can get it
[14:49:44] <placidb> taplar: I fixed it. but it wasn't a jQuery issue.
[14:49:49] <z1haze> now, does the function i place inside .when() actually run
[14:49:54] <z1haze> or does it just check
[14:49:59] <placidb> I was also transitioning the z-index on the same duration as the other elements
[14:50:16] <placidb> which resulted in different browser behavior
[14:50:20] <taplar> z1haze: what you'll need to do is collect the deferred objects from each of your requests, and those are what you'll do the when on.
[14:50:28] <taplar> i'm checking now to see if the when will take in an array or not
[14:51:42] <z1haze> i thought just $.when(mini_stream_refresh()).done(function() { remove my div }); or no?
[14:52:11] <taplar> no, not quite that simple
[14:52:22] <z1haze> damn, never is
[14:53:21] <z1haze> may be i should just use a callback, or would that still not work right since they are ajax requests
[14:56:29] <taplar> i'm thinking you might can do it with apply()
[14:57:01] <taplar> i'm going to alter your fiddle
[15:00:00] <z1haze> i dont actually need anything from that function, i just need it to be done
[15:00:12] <z1haze> because it inserts into the dom and i need to count that
[15:01:21] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/Lsd76jdx/2/
[15:01:30] <taplar> hopefully i got the syntax of the apply right
[15:01:40] <taplar> but something like
[15:02:14] <taplar> for each ajax call it adds the deferred to the array.  and at the end we give all the deferred elements to be applied to the when function
[15:02:24] <taplar> then give it a done function to call once all of them are finished
[15:03:00] <z1haze> didnt seem to do anything
[15:03:06] <taplar> :(
[15:03:14] <z1haze> loading streams still there
[15:03:36] <taplar> oh, you mean in the fiddle?
[15:03:42] <z1haze> yep
[15:03:47] <taplar> i didn't make the done do anything
[15:03:53] <z1haze> i pasted in it
[15:04:03] <NoiseEee> taplar: that sounds like an excuse i'd hear from my kid
[15:04:10] <taplar> lol
[15:05:19] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/Lsd76jdx/5/
[15:07:24] <z1haze> im gonna play this this in live site, did you just add an array for the ajaxcalls
[15:08:18] <taplar> the array, the push to the array, and the check for length of the array with the apply
[15:08:32] <taplar> also in the fiddle i commented out the tooltip call which was erroring with undefined
[15:08:42] <taplar> but that was just to stop that error
[15:15:18] <z1haze> ffs a simple window load function works good enough lol
[15:36:36] <RedBelette> Hi all
[15:37:42] <RedBelette> If someone are available, i need to ask some questions
[15:37:49] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel.
[15:37:53] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:38:21] <RedBelette> thx, it's my first participation on the chat :)
[15:39:23] <RedBelette> okay, i am practice an exercice to understand jquery & json
[15:40:26] <RedBelette> i use $.getJSON to contact a webpage based in a wamp installation
[15:41:05] <RedBelette> my exercice is a basic authentification
[15:41:34] <RedBelette> and i want to pass email and password by the getJSON call
[15:41:50] <RedBelette> i have something like this :
[15:42:13] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle and show us your code :)
[15:42:36] <RedBelette> ok :)
[15:43:30] <Uhkis> and if this is a school exercise, remember this channel is publicly logged ;)
[15:43:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:45:22] <RedBelette> https://jsfiddle.net/2nghc1h9/
[15:45:31] <RedBelette> can you see the code ?
[15:46:54] <Uhkis> RedBelette: your key and value are in reverse order in the getJSON call
[15:47:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a log of console logging.
[15:47:20] <robertmaxrees> and it's "authentication", not "authentification" fwiw.
[15:47:39] <RedBelette> french mistake lol
[15:47:44] <RedBelette> sorry about that
[15:47:50] <robertmaxrees> also, why do 	var submitButton = $('#submitButton'); if you're not going to use that var?
[15:48:23] <Uhkis> RedBelette: you want {'email': email, 'password': password} there
[15:48:33] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, your getJSON object is backwards - you can just remove the quotes and call it a day.
[15:48:54] <RedBelette> just for logging and it permit to me to trace the var
[15:50:25] <Uhkis> and hey, at least RedBelette is using logs instead of alerts like sooo many people do :)
[15:50:41] <RedBelette> thanks ^^
[15:50:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah - just a LOT of them - only need to log the core object that comes through though.
[15:52:51] <RedBelette> in fact, the call of authentification.php is correct but in php, i dont understand how can i get the value (email, password)
[15:53:10] <RedBelette> can i post the php code ?
[15:53:23] <robertmaxrees> this isn't really the right place for that part.
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> check out ##php
[15:54:21] <Uhkis> or some basic googling around $_GET
[15:55:00] <RedBelette> i cannot join #php or ##php
[15:55:28] <RedBelette> i want to receive in $_POST or other way, not on the url
[15:55:50] <robertmaxrees> you need to register on freenode for that.
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, google.
[15:55:57] <Uhkis> well then you need to use $.post on the js side
[15:57:00] <RedBelette> $.post on the js side ?
[15:57:04] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:57:15] <robertmaxrees> jquery needs to post that data.
[16:00:37] <RedBelette> thanks you so much, i think that's the thing that i need
[16:03:09] <RedBelette> and the getJSON concern only the $_GET, ok my bad, it's logical
[16:05:16] <z1haze> so my solution didnt really give me the best results, even though it does remove the loading eventually, it doesnt do it when its supposed to. Id like to remove the loading div after the function returns all of the ajax responses and inserts the elements into the dom
[16:05:34] <robertmaxrees> you want deferreds.
[16:05:54] <z1haze> ill paste my code now in a fiddle to show what i have
[16:10:13] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/a1t7165d/5/
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:10:58] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you're aware that ajax is asynchronous, right?
[16:11:10] <robertmaxrees> and you want something to happen when all of those ajax calls are done, right?
[16:11:20] <z1haze> yea
[16:11:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so use deferreds.
[16:11:28] <z1haze> i just want to remove the loading div
[16:11:36] <z1haze> i have looked them up i dont understsand it
[16:11:59] <z1haze> i dont actually return anything from mini_stream_refresh() so what am i supposed to pass it
[16:12:08] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> you return the $.ajax() calls.
[16:12:30] <robertmaxrees> actually, you return a map of the streams array.
[16:12:32] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[16:14:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/a1t7165d/6/ something like this.
[16:15:13] <robertmaxrees> that might not work exactly, but you get the ide.a
[16:15:23] <z1haze> why isnt it loading in
[16:15:49] <robertmaxrees> syntax error on my part.
[16:16:21] <Kars-T> I do some DOM manipulation for example add a class and some childs. Than I clone() the item. But the clone seems to lack all added things? Okay thats what I want but why?
[16:17:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:17:29] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, i dont see what you did at all
[16:17:42] <z1haze> it doesnt even work partially
[16:17:43] <robertmaxrees> woops one sec.
[16:17:46] <robertmaxrees> and yeah.
[16:17:52] <robertmaxrees> i said it might not work exactly, but you should get the idea.
[16:18:31] <z1haze> what did you do though..
[16:18:49] <robertmaxrees> returns a map that gets you all the ajax calls.
[16:18:56] <robertmaxrees> look at mini_stream_refresh
[16:20:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused by what your code was doing before.
[16:20:13] <z1haze> http://jsfiddle.net/a1t7165d/6/ ?
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:21:15] <z1haze> hmm did that send to you
[16:21:22] <robertmaxrees> yes, and i asked you to not PM me.
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[16:21:39] <z1haze> you said you were confused what the code was doing
[16:21:47] <z1haze> i kindly linked you the example that i dont want public
[16:21:56] <robertmaxrees> i understand your intent, sort of, but the organization is all off.
[16:21:58] <z1haze> no need to be a baby about it
[16:22:05] <robertmaxrees> and if you don't want it to be public, i don't want to see it.
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> and i ask that nobody PMs me without checking in the channel first.  pretty common courtesey,
[16:22:30] <robertmaxrees> i'll thank you to not call me a baby again, thanks :)
[16:22:41] <z1haze> its not like im knocking on your door dude,its a freaking message.
[16:22:43] <z1haze> lol
[16:22:54] <robertmaxrees> PMs completely circumvent the point of the channel.
[16:23:10] <robertmaxrees> and if you don't want it to be public, i don't want to see it.  really not that big of a deal.
[16:23:11] <z1haze> not when you wante to know something in particular about my code.
[16:23:18] <z1haze> because it isnt finished
[16:23:20] <bambanx> hey
[16:23:26] <bambanx> why not loading my cats guys http://codepen.io/bambanx/pen/KdbGRe
[16:23:41] <robertmaxrees> my question was more about why you have it structured this way.
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> not what your end goal is.
[16:23:58] <robertmaxrees> like, you call that function multiple times, but i don't see why.
[16:24:02] <z1haze> probably  because i dont konw any better would be my only excuse
[16:24:26] <z1haze> oh thats just me trying to get the fiddle right
[16:24:31] <z1haze> my actual code doesnt call it twice
[16:24:57] <robertmaxrees> so the basic idea is that you wnat to return an array of promises.
[16:25:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/a1t7165d/9/ there we go.
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> the basic idea.
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> and code you want to have run after all the ajax calls have finished need to be in the .done(function() {}) callback of $.when.apply($, allStreams).done(function() {
[16:26:57] <bambanx> anyone can help me with my cats?
[16:27:07] <bambanx> http://codepen.io/bambanx/pen/KdbGRe
[16:27:16] <robertmaxrees> bambanx no need to spam, and you're not loading masonry in that pen.
[16:27:46] <bambanx> but i linked on the pen robertmaxrees
[16:27:52] <bambanx> not sure what im doing wrong
[16:27:53] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[16:27:58] <robertmaxrees> $(...).masonry is not a function
[16:28:38] <Uhkis> bambanx: also, placekitten is broken
[16:28:51] <z1haze> yea placekitten is broke
[16:28:57] <z1haze> use placeholdit
[16:28:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to load jquery first, too.
[16:29:21] <bambanx> okey
[16:29:33] <bambanx> is needed on codepen put docment ready?
[16:29:35] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, so after returning this array map.. what do i do with it
[16:29:46] <robertmaxrees> z1haze look at the code below that function.
[16:29:50] <robertmaxrees> i already did it.
[16:29:54] <robertmaxrees> bambanx not sure.
[16:30:01] <robertmaxrees> but document ready has nothing to do with your problem, bambanx
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> z1haze see $.when.apply($, allStreams).done(function() { ?
[16:30:21] <bambanx> okey i will check
[16:32:39] <z1haze> return streams_array.map(function(streamer) { where does streamer come from
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> you could name that whatever you want.
[16:32:54] <z1haze> you removed the variable
[16:32:55] <z1haze> oh
[16:33:04] <robertmaxrees> streamer made more sense to me.
[16:33:11] <z1haze> is that streamer the result of each ajax call?
[16:33:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:33:31] <robertmaxrees> that's only mapping over the streams array.
[16:33:32] <z1haze> then what is streamer? im trying to understand
[16:33:40] <robertmaxrees> streamer is the object in the array.
[16:33:52] <z1haze> oh
[16:34:16] <z1haze> man this is beyond me, i see that it will probably work. but for my learning curve is there something that would do this but on an easier level
[16:34:20] <z1haze> i dont understand this whole array map stuff
[16:34:26] <robertmaxrees> then learn about it.
[16:34:52] <robertmaxrees> .map() basically transforms one array into another format - it "maps" into a new format.
[16:35:47] <z1haze> and why do we need map in this case
[16:36:04] <robertmaxrees> because we want to take that array of stream names and turn them into an array of promises.
[16:37:17] <z1haze> and returning twice in the same function is ok?
[16:37:27] <robertmaxrees> you're nopt returning twice in the same function.
[16:37:41] <robertmaxrees> you're returning the $.ajax() call from the callback for .map()
[16:42:10] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, earlier you mentioned you prefer var foo = function() { right?
[16:42:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:42:21] <z1haze> how do you then call the function
[16:42:37] <robertmaxrees> the same way you do otherwise.
[16:42:38] <robertmaxrees> foo()
[16:42:47] <z1haze> oh wait nvm, with way though, it has to be defined first
[16:42:52] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:42:55] <bambanx> i am doing the same of here http://masonry.desandro.com/#install  but not sure why still get errors of masonry is not a function http://codepen.io/bambanx/pen/KdbGRe
[16:42:57] <z1haze> got it
[16:43:20] <robertmaxrees> when you do function someName() {}; the engine actually goes to the top of the current scope and does a var someName; for you.
[16:44:08] <robertmaxrees> bambanx i'm not getting that error any more.
[16:44:33] <bambanx> oh yeah i refreshed not error now :) thanks
[16:46:53] <bambanx> how i can avoid the overflow images http://codepen.io/bambanx/pen/KdbGRe
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:48:03] <bambanx> :D
[16:48:03] <bambanx> hehe
[16:48:21] <robertmaxrees> go read the documentation.  that's what most of us would need to do.
[16:50:31] <BobLobLawBlog> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm $('#violator .handle a').css('transform', 'rotate(180deg)');
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[16:51:24] <BobLobLawBlog> except, it doesn't work.  it must be formated wrong
[16:52:03] <BobLobLawBlog> .css('property','value'), but transform: rotate(180deg)   has two properties and one value?
[16:52:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.  one property and one value.
[16:52:47] <BobLobLawBlog> you know what I just realized, Ill just toggle a class
[16:52:53] <BobLobLawBlog> ill have to do vendor prefixes anyways
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> that's generally how you do it anyway
[16:53:09] <BobLobLawBlog> yea tis nice
[17:01:00] <BobLobLawBlog> there should be a .toggleClass()
[17:01:20] <RedBelette> i have a problem with $_SESSION php variable (i know that's not the place but if you know i will be happy). I dont need to keep any vars in the session, however i have the same phpidsession

[17:01:51] <RedBelette> getJSON work on another php session ?
[17:02:03] <robertmaxrees> and RedBelette make an account and head to ##php
[17:03:17] <RedBelette> ok
[17:05:44] <RedBelette> how can i create an account, do you have a webpage or something else ?
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration
[17:06:33] <robertmaxrees> instructions are in there.
[17:06:41] <RedBelette> thk
[17:06:55] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend.
[17:07:35] <RedBelette> i prefer an human :)
[17:07:42] <robertmaxrees> we prefer you use google ;)
[17:10:25] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, this new way seems to cause the entire page to lock up while loading
[17:10:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze hrm?
[17:10:38] <ashemark> Hi!
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> did you do async: false or something?
[17:10:48] <z1haze> yes
[17:10:52] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[17:10:54] <z1haze> ah
[17:10:58] <robertmaxrees> don't use async: false ever
[17:11:01] <z1haze> lol ok
[17:11:10] <ashemark> I have a form submit listener in a page's javascript file, which I'm having a hard time trying to debug
[17:11:29] <z1haze> seems to have same result though
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> z1haze all the code we made was setup so you don't need to use that anyway.
[17:11:32] <ashemark> the breakpoints I mark in chrome dev tools work when the form is initially loaded, not when it is submitted..
[17:11:48] <robertmaxrees> ashemark show us your code.
[17:12:29] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: can't, will have to show an approximation instead..
[17:12:37] <ashemark> let me put together a fiddle
[17:12:40] <robertmaxrees> ashemark uh... lol okay.
[17:14:40] <z1haze> was setup?
[17:17:06] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/dukiyalobe/edit?html,js,output
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't see an issue here.
[17:18:37] <ashemark> me neither
[17:19:24] <ashemark> so I set breakpoints at the $('form').submit(.. line, but it breaks on page load, not when the submit is pressed
[17:19:35] <robertmaxrees> right, because that's when that code runs.
[17:19:47] <robertmaxrees> you want to set your breakpoint inside the handler.
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> basically, $('form').submit(someFunction) runs once when it's called.  the body of the function is what's run on submit.
[17:20:47] <ashemark> ....
[17:20:55] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:20:58] <ashemark> that's the stupidest mistake anyone can ever make
[17:21:01] <ashemark> seriously
[17:21:03] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:21:03] <BobLobLawBlog> is there an easy way to rotate an image 180 deg in js?
[17:21:38] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: is there a way to keep jquery out of the debugging/breakpoints?
[17:21:43] <robertmaxrees> BobLobLawBlog http://stackoverflow.com/a/16794524/923919
[17:22:02] <robertmaxrees> ashemark i know firefox lets you "black box" certain sources.
[17:22:05] <robertmaxrees> not sure about chrome or IR.
[17:22:07] <robertmaxrees> *IE
[17:22:14] <ashemark> hmm
[17:23:41] <ashemark> robertmaxrees: cool, found a way to blackbox jquery/etc in chrome
[17:23:43] <ashemark> thanks
[17:23:49] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[17:39:38] <z1haze> whats the difference when using click vs on('click'
[17:39:48] <robertmaxrees> .click uses .on('click' under the hood
[17:40:41] <z1haze> so no difference?
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> not functionally, no.
[17:41:05] <z1haze> alright.. well i have a link that opens a modal
[17:41:26] <robertmaxrees> in fact, the docs at tell you https://api.jquery.com/click/ -> "This method is a shortcut for .on( "click", handler )"
[17:41:27] <z1haze> but i also have a click function for that button as well to change some attributes in the modal, but nothing is happening
[17:41:39] <PokerGod> I am trying to use dragtables on datatables.  I seem to be having an issue.  Do you guys know if it should work?
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> z1haze might need to use a delegated listener.
[17:42:26] <robertmaxrees> PokerGod no idea.  i might hit up their forums.
[17:43:50] <z1haze> ie ie $(".streamer.online").click(function() { alert('test'); } gives me no alert but the modal pops up
[17:44:09] <robertmaxrees> z1haze does that element get dynamically created?
[17:44:14] <z1haze> yes
[17:44:57] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, you need a delegated listener.
[17:45:11] <robertmaxrees> need to use a special version of .on()
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:46:28] <z1haze> so it takes 2 params
[17:46:35] <robertmaxrees> 3
[17:46:47] <robertmaxrees> the event, the target, and the functionm
[17:46:49] <robertmaxrees> *function
[17:47:26] <z1haze> ok hmm
[17:47:40] <z1haze> so what if the click opens a modal
[17:47:51] <z1haze> thats not within this div
[17:48:08] <robertmaxrees> nothing to do with the listener.
[17:48:22] <z1haze> $( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() { the first one in this case is the target?
[17:48:31] <z1haze> and its saying when you click the tr?
[17:48:37] <robertmaxrees> bind to $('#dataTable') instead
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[17:48:48] <z1haze> thats the example i got from that page
[17:48:58] <z1haze> im not using a datatable but ok
[17:49:01] <z1haze> i think i get it
[17:49:13] <robertmaxrees> then yes, you've got the idea.
[17:49:33] <z1haze> $("#vid_modal").on('click' '.streamer', function() { ?
[17:49:36] <z1haze> based on my previous
[17:49:46] <robertmaxrees> the modal is getting dynamically created?
[17:50:21] <robertmaxrees> if so, then no.
[17:50:29] <z1haze> yes
[17:50:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to bind up to a parent element of the modal that is not dynamically created.
[17:50:39] <z1haze> i have to basically create everything dynamically with this site
[17:50:55] <z1haze> i can only just <script src=" and add my my content to the dom that way
[17:51:11] <z1haze> and ok if thats wrong, what part is wrong
[17:51:19] <robertmaxrees> the element you're binding to.
[17:51:36] <z1haze> on i have to pick something thats always there/
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> the docs to .on() explain it pretty clearly - $() <- this element needs to exist at the time of binding.
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> so you bind to a parent element that always exists.
[17:52:02] <z1haze> and thats the .streamer that needs changed right
[17:52:18] <robertmaxrees> is .streamer the element you want to trigger on?
[17:52:19] <z1haze> its what thing that gets clicked
[17:52:39] <z1haze> .streamer is what is clicked, #vid_modal is what i need to modify
[17:52:53] <robertmaxrees> modify for the binding, yes.
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain that the second argument to .on() is where the event emitted from.
[17:53:40] <z1haze> wil lthis work: .streams_insert a.streamer.online if .streams_insert is the parent element that is always there?
[17:53:51] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[17:54:10] <z1haze> yea it doesnt work, i just dont get it
[17:54:22] <robertmaxrees> is .streams_insert a parent element that exists on pageload?
[17:54:27] <z1haze> yes
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready?
[17:54:31] <z1haze> yes
[17:54:38] <robertmaxrees> dunno without seeing an example then.
[17:54:46] <robertmaxrees> unless something is stopping propagation
[17:58:04] <z1haze> this might be very hard to put on a fiddle but im gonna try
[17:58:17] <robertmaxrees> also: fixingthesejquery.com
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> i might run through this if i were you.
[18:03:40] <z1haze> i cant get it working in
[18:03:43] <z1haze> a fiddle*(
[18:03:49] <robertmaxrees> so the same issue?
[18:04:22] <z1haze> nah its just too much of a mess in the fiddle too many imports and w/e im not too sure
[18:05:18] <z1haze> basically this is what i have, a bunch of 'html' modules on this website builder thing, i can only dynamically insert my content, so i just go inside the html module that i place on the page, and do a script src="my remote file"></script> which is basically justa bit ass long var content = 'blah blah blah html'; and i document.write(content);
[18:05:33] <z1haze> this is in the body of the page
[18:05:57] <robertmaxrees> don't use document.write()
[18:05:57] <z1haze> that is how the modal is loaded
[18:06:16] <robertmaxrees> but that sounds like none of those elements are available on pageload then.
[18:06:20] <robertmaxrees> try binding to body.
[18:06:29] <z1haze> yes
[18:06:33] <z1haze> soem are available on page load
[18:06:44] <z1haze> the parent is available on page load
[18:07:00] <robertmaxrees> is that parent apart of the stuff that gets loaded by that document.write() call?
[18:07:00] <z1haze> http://puu.sh/lkuSU/3fcda9d471.png is available on page laod
[18:07:05] <z1haze> nope
[18:07:12] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno.
[18:07:14] <z1haze> only the modal in this case
[18:07:20] <robertmaxrees> try binding to body and see if that fixes anything.
[18:07:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, hard to help.
[18:07:46] <z1haze> $('#vid_modal').on('click', 'body a.streamer', function() { ?
[18:07:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:07:53] <robertmaxrees> bind to body.
[18:08:03] <robertmaxrees> $() is what you're binding to.
[18:08:12] <z1haze> then how will it know what to modify
[18:08:17] <robertmaxrees>  $('body').on('click', #vid_modal a.streamer', function() {
[18:08:33] <z1haze> oh
[18:09:03] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.  if it doesn't, then there's some invalid markup or something is stopping propagation or something else weird is going on.
[18:09:08] <robertmaxrees> you aren't duplicating IDs, right?
[18:09:10] <z1haze> $('body').on('click', '#vid_modal', 'a.streamer', function() {
[18:09:14] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:09:21] <robertmaxrees> i literally just gave you the code you need to use.
[18:09:24] <robertmaxrees> $('body').on('click', #vid_modal a.streamer', function() {
[18:09:25] <z1haze> no theres only a single modal, im just dynamically changing its content
[18:09:35] <z1haze> yea but that code wont work
[18:09:38] <z1haze> a.streamer isnt in the modal..
[18:09:40] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[18:09:43] <z1haze> wtf?
[18:09:45] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:09:47] <z1haze> its the link you click to open the modal
[18:09:48] <robertmaxrees> it's not?
[18:09:52] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:09:55] <robertmaxrees> dide
[18:10:08] <robertmaxrees> *dude - that link needs to be a child of whatever you target with $()
[18:10:10] <z1haze> http://stephen3.enjin.com/ stream buttons on the right
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> that's why it doesn't work.
[18:10:34] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.  the modal and the link that opens it hardly have any relationship,.
[18:10:42] <z1haze> no kidding
[18:10:44] <z1haze> thats the problem
[18:10:53] <z1haze> data-target="#vid_modal"
[18:10:56] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {};
[18:10:58] <robertmaxrees> that's the syntax.
[18:11:26] <z1haze> so how does one modify an element its not a child/parent of
[18:11:41] <robertmaxrees> you target it in the handler.
[18:12:02] <z1haze> ive showed you the live page, you can see what im trying to do
[18:12:06] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[18:12:10] <z1haze> no thanks what
[18:12:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to go through all of that code.
[18:12:17] <z1haze> im not asking you to
[18:12:19] <z1haze> its a mess
[18:12:27] <z1haze> im just showing you func\tionally what happens
[18:12:30] <z1haze> click the stream, a modal opens
[18:12:34] <z1haze> i need to modify the modal
[18:12:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/6u6gyrad/
[18:12:44] <robertmaxrees> click link, div's text update.
[18:12:46] <robertmaxrees> really basic premise.
[18:13:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/6u6gyrad/1/ the delegated version.
[18:13:27] <z1haze> yea.. but see here.. <div> is there on page load
[18:13:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:13:41] <z1haze> my modal that i need to modify is NOT there on page load
[18:13:53] <robertmaxrees> is the link you're binding to inside of the modal?
[18:13:55] <robertmaxrees> or outside?
[18:14:00] <z1haze> outside.
[18:14:07] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need a delegated listener.
[18:14:11] <z1haze> lemme try one more try
[18:14:16] <robertmaxrees> the link is not in the modal, so that's not the issue.
[18:14:31] <robertmaxrees> you could bind directly to that link and everything will be fine.
[18:14:40] <z1haze> the link im clicking though is created by jquery
[18:14:44] <z1haze> so it also is not there on page load
[18:14:49] <z1haze> the modal, nor my link is there on page load
[18:16:11] <robertmaxrees> so then the delegated listener has nothing to do with the modal.
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated listener for a parent of that link you're binding to.
[18:17:51] <z1haze> yea i figured it out
[18:17:59] <z1haze> i have 1 too many pieces in the puzzle
[18:18:12] <z1haze> i didnt need anything to do with the modal at all
[18:19:04] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:21:28] <RedBelette> can we hash password in jquery ?
[18:21:51] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:22:27] <RedBelette> ok thanks
[18:34:33] <ryanneufeld> RedBelette: there are javascript implementations of hash algorithms, but you're better off using an ssl connection to post the password to a server to do the hashing for you.
[18:35:22] <ceramicskulls> So I have a grid of users that tie to this click function. The click function just opens the fancybox with more user information. My issue is that when I try to reopen a user I already clicked, it returns blank. Not all the code is here, but this is generally where I think the issue is. http://jsfiddle.net/96uxu9k5/
[18:36:39] <robertmaxrees> where's the bug?
[18:37:06] <ceramicskulls> I think is has to be around here:  $('#inner_modal').html('');
[18:37:26] <ryanneufeld> Also, why are you posting to GET data?
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> looks like maybe you need to use a delegated listener here instead.
[18:38:01] <ceramicskulls> That's how it was written: ryanneufeld
[18:38:14] <ryanneufeld> I can see that
[18:39:11] <ceramicskulls> Also, I think the reason is if a user is logged in, they're able to change their data
[18:39:25] <ryanneufeld> okay
[18:39:28] <ceramicskulls> which is why it may be $.post (I can't confirm)
[18:40:32] <ryanneufeld> you could do with some selector caching too
[18:41:59] <ryanneufeld> I would also consider moving the $('#inner_modal_loader').show(); into the load_modal() function
[18:42:18] <ryanneufeld> in fact, you can move all that logic in to the load_modal function
[18:42:31] <ryanneufeld> and just have .on('click', load_modal)
[18:48:52] <ceramicskulls> ryanneufeld: but then how would it grab the user id for the actual ajax?
[18:49:08] <ryanneufeld> same as it does now
[18:49:13] <ryanneufeld> sec
[18:49:22] <ryanneufeld> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[18:49:30] <ryanneufeld> read that while I rejigger some code ceramicskulls
[18:49:51] <ceramicskulls> kk cool thanks
[18:52:45] <ryanneufeld> what version of fancybox are you using?
[18:52:54] <ryanneufeld> you didn't include a complete example
[18:53:00] <ryanneufeld> ceramicskulls:
[18:53:30] <ceramicskulls> version: 2.1.5
[18:57:53] <ceramicskulls> ryanneufeld - seems like some of the jquery pages are down ;[
[18:58:00] <RedBelette> Do you think that correct for an authentification ?
[18:58:01] <RedBelette> https://jsfiddle.net/2nghc1h9/2/
[18:58:11] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskulls like what?
[18:58:27] <ceramicskulls> http://api.jquery.com/event.delegateTarget/
[18:58:56] <ceramicskulls> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ all the pages linked there are pretty much down lol
[18:59:06] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[18:59:35] <ceramicskulls> it seems like the http versions are down
[18:59:42] <ceramicskulls> but not https ;l
[19:01:26] <ryanneufeld> ceramicskulls: http://jsfiddle.net/96uxu9k5/2/
[19:01:31] <ryanneufeld> something like that would work
[19:01:43] <ryanneufeld> but if you're returning HTML, fancybox can manage that for you
[19:01:51] <ryanneufeld> I'd suggest you explore their callbacks etc
[19:02:18] <ryanneufeld> ceramicskulls: that's about all the time I have, I hope that helps
[19:02:38] <ceramicskulls> Ah
[19:13:44] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, why not use the document.write
[19:14:06] <z1haze> thats the only way i can write straight to the document isnt it? which selecting where the content should go
[19:14:47] <robertmaxrees> you can (and should) append instead.
[19:15:03] <z1haze> right, but i have no selector
[19:15:11] <robertmaxrees> you have a node.
[19:15:13] <robertmaxrees> document.
[19:15:27] <z1haze> right, but that wont place it where it needs to go
[19:15:59] <robertmaxrees> then target the place it needs to go.
[19:16:05] <z1haze> i cant
[19:16:11] <z1haze> its just the specific module
[19:16:13] <robertmaxrees> so there's nothing in the document?
[19:16:21] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/802854/why-is-document-write-considered-a-bad-practice
[19:16:23] <z1haze> of course there is, but nothing unique about the container
[19:16:35] <z1haze> therefore nothing specific enough to put the content exactly where iwant it
[19:16:45] <robertmaxrees> you could use jquery to .append()
[19:16:51] <robertmaxrees> and select that unique path.
[19:17:17] <z1haze> i dont have a unique path is what im saying
[19:17:40] <z1haze> literally each 'module' just has a class of container_module or something like that
[19:17:41] <robertmaxrees> you can select specific instances of elements or give them classes.
[19:17:51] <robertmaxrees> if there's a unique path, for instance.
[19:17:58] <ryanneufeld> z1haze: so add something unique to the container?
[19:18:07] <z1haze> icant
[19:18:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ you can even use indexes if it's really that limited.
[19:18:22] <ryanneufeld> that sounds silly
[19:18:26] <z1haze> it is silly
[19:18:35] <robertmaxrees> why are you so limited?
[19:19:06] <z1haze> the commuinity website thing limits what you can do
[19:19:17] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[19:19:38] <ryanneufeld> how are you injecting your code?
[19:19:49] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[19:19:49] <b-ot> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:19:50] <z1haze> from a script
[19:20:05] <z1haze> <script src="my_remote_file"></script
[19:20:06] * ryanneufeld facepalms
[19:20:15] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i feel like maybe you need to go through the learning center.
[19:20:18] <z1haze> facepalm all you want i dont havea choice
[19:20:26] <z1haze> lol
[19:20:31] <robertmaxrees> you also probably need to use a templating engine if you're really THAT limited.
[19:20:32] <z1haze> its not about that, its a matter of limitations
[19:20:36] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[19:20:36] <b-ot> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:20:39] <z1haze> its not like its my point.
[19:20:47] <robertmaxrees> you can still target by index.
[19:20:48] <z1haze> my enjoyment.
[19:20:53] <robertmaxrees> so you CAN get specific elements.
[19:20:59] <z1haze> ok sounds good
[19:21:03] <z1haze> what do you mean by that though
[19:21:06] <ryanneufeld> a demo would be really helpful
[19:21:07] <robertmaxrees> by what?
[19:21:13] <z1haze> by index
[19:21:23] <ryanneufeld> you can get the nth item
[19:21:28] <robertmaxrees> zyh .index() or nth child.
[19:21:29] <z1haze> $(this.parents('div')) or something
[19:21:31] <robertmaxrees> err, z1haze
[19:21:33] <ryanneufeld> so $('div') will give you all the divs
[19:22:02] <ryanneufeld> so $('div').index(5) will give you the 5th one on the page
[19:22:14] <z1haze> its dynamic..
[19:22:19] <z1haze> it changes all the time
[19:22:26] <robertmaxrees> you can also filter based on contents.
[19:22:27] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ z1haze
[19:22:27] <b-ot> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:22:33] <z1haze> stop saying that
[19:22:36] <ryanneufeld> then do it
[19:22:38] <z1haze> no.
[19:22:41] <z1haze> it wouldnt help
[19:22:45] <ryanneufeld> k, i'm done helping then
[19:22:49] <z1haze> fine by me.
[19:22:53] <robertmaxrees> z1haze your questions are really broad either way.
[19:23:04] <ryanneufeld> ?ab
[19:23:04] <b-ot> AMAZING (synthetic) BENCHMARKS™
[19:23:11] <z1haze> well, think of this platform as similar to phpnuke back in the day
[19:23:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[19:23:18] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[19:23:19] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:23:44] <ryanneufeld> what would be helpful is some html that looks like what you're working with
[19:23:46] <z1haze> robert youve already been linked to the page multiple times so..
[19:23:59] <z1haze> and you said ' no thanks '
[19:23:59] <robertmaxrees> z1haze and i shouldn't need the full page to help with isolated problems.
[19:24:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:24:27] <z1haze> extracting  the problem away from this website and putting it in a fiddle is going to break away from my restrictions
[19:24:43] <ryanneufeld> it wont, I promise
[19:24:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:24:54] <ryanneufeld> this is our thing
[19:24:59] <ryanneufeld> it's what we do
[19:26:40] <ryanneufeld> z1haze: try to put yourself in our shoes. You're asking us to help you write code, to work with HTML we can't see/visualize
[19:27:09] <ryanneufeld> if someone asked you to solve a problem that way how would you proceed?
[19:27:19] <robertmaxrees> right, and having to look through the entire site is unhelpful in these cases because then we have to sift through everything else to get the one specific problem you're having.
[19:29:08] <ryanneufeld> z1haze: my intent isn't to admonish you, or make you feel stupid. I genuinely would like to see your problem solved. Unfortunately I am not capable of reading minds, so it's rather difficult.
[19:29:12] <ryanneufeld> I wish you luck.
[21:45:20] <acidjazz> yall made robertmaxrees ragequit
[21:45:22] <acidjazz> whatd you do to him
[21:52:43] <dl14> Does anyone have a clean way to handle what's going on in this codeshare as it scales to more and more URLs in a .when/.done construct? http://codeshare.io/G0Lei
[22:28:27] <dl14> not sure who bit at the codeshare, but maybe what's there doesn't appear entirely newb, as you can now reorder the list, add to it, etc, and refer to a response by a symbolic name rather than the first or the second or the nth
[23:07:03] <webjunkie> hi can someone help me with this issue, the language selector works fine on chrome,ff,safari, but you cant really select languages in IE, the selection goes away before you can select, how can i get it working in IE, http://bit.ly/1MePqKb ?
