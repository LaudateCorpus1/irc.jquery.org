[11:45:22] <berndj> i want to call .click(...) on an element selected from some content i just .prepend()ed to some other stuff that already has click event handlers. how do i get hold of the just-added nodes?
[12:00:21] <shoky> berndj: put them into a variable before prepending them. e.g.  const elem = $('<div>hi</div>'); elem.click(...); foo.prepend(elem);
[12:01:14] <berndj> shoky, i tried that, but it didn't seem to take effect. the click just sends me off to page.html#
[12:01:46] <shoky> donno what you did. make a jsfiddle
[12:11:05] <berndj> turns out i donno what i did either, i tried it again, inevitably slightly differently, and now the event sticks
[12:11:31] <berndj> i thought maybe events don't stick to detached objects
