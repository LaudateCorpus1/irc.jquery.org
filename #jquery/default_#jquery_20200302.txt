[06:48:59] <asdf67> hello everybody
[06:49:07] <asdf67> jQuery UI download gives me error 502
[06:49:24] <asdf67> (when submitting the form)
[06:50:30] <asdf67> anybody here?
[06:50:48] <asdf67> does this IRC thing even work?
[06:51:58] <Cork> sure, if you give ppl any time to answer...
[07:30:58] <undefined_bob> lol
[07:31:35] <undefined_bob> btw how are you doing, Cork? Are you alright?
[07:31:49] <Cork> ya, i'm fine
[07:31:54] <Cork> you?
[07:32:09] <undefined_bob> glad to hear that
[07:32:30] <undefined_bob> yeah, I'm fine too. Just a bit tired and the usual monday shit
[08:14:39] <Phruis`> can you return javascript with ajax and just put it in your object?
[08:14:57] <Cork> Phruis`: you can return a string with javascript in it
[08:15:16] <Cork> but you will then have to evaluate the javascript as it won't be something executable by default
[08:15:41] <Cork> Phruis`: so if you use csr you won't be able to get that to work
[08:15:42] <Phruis`> Cork, i see I am doing something with this http://live.datatables.net/qimukefe/26/edit to get a dynamic set of headers
[08:16:01] <Phruis`> but i use php to define some of the types
[08:16:22] <Phruis`> it is [ { } ] with javascript in it in the columns section
[08:16:38] <Cork> Phruis`: i would encode the type in the json object and have the static javascript check that instead
[08:16:47] <Cork> you don't want dynamic javascript it is a pain to debug
[08:17:22] <Phruis`> ok
[08:18:14] <Cork> it is easy enough, and depending on how complext the change is you might even be able to see it in the structure without haveing to add it as a separate field
[08:20:08] <Phruis`> Cork, ya will have to play around with it
[10:02:31] <Phruis`> Cork, oh man figured out how to do it using eval
[10:59:03] <Cork> Phruis`: note that if you choose to do it that way you have two problems: 1. make damn sure you don't expose your self to xss by letting user content be evaluated
[11:00:14] <Cork> and 2. if you ever want to restrict xss problems by using "Content Security Policy" (csr) you won't be able to
[11:00:33] <Cork> Phruis`: cause of these reasons i would recommend against using that method
[12:56:02] <Phruis`> Cork, gotcha thanks for the tips.  Currently I have CSR and XSS protections enabled.  The javascript is just for display modification on the datatable.  Basically the "render" portion.  You think that is some how a security risk?
[12:56:07] <Phruis`> I don't see how it could be
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> Phruis` are you displaying data input by users?
[13:17:19] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, no
[13:17:34] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, the eval data comes from the server
[13:18:01] <robertmaxrees> right - the issue is using eval opens up the potential for an easy attack vector.
[13:18:40] <robertmaxrees> dynamically generating code is also a great way to give yourself headaches later on :)
[13:19:07] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, sure i understand that, but just trying to wrap my brain around how it could be used in that way because wont all client side scripts/fields still require the same server side considerations?
[13:20:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> not sure i understand the question.
[13:21:25] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, well if you are checking on input on the server it is always going to need to be checked right?
[13:21:32] <Phruis`> how will eval change that?
[13:21:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean validating input?
[13:21:47] <Phruis`> yeah
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> and sanitizing it?
[13:21:55] <Phruis`> yeah
[13:22:03] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i'd never implicitly trust that.
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> things break all the time.
[13:22:46] <Cork> and sanitizing is a guess work at best, time and time again there is new ways to work around them
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:23:16] <Cork> if you never evaluate input data at all, and only keep it as "data" you don't have to take the risk
[13:23:19] <robertmaxrees> and that's not the only reason to not use eval.  9/10 times it's the wrong tool for the job.
[13:23:26] <Cork> as you can't execute a string, cause; it is a string
[13:24:20] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:24:23] <Cork> and for maintainability it is a big no no in by book, as you get the problem that you don't have a file with the source code in
[13:24:46] <Cork> so breakpointing or exception references becomes a PAIN
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> Phruis` why do you think eval is the right choice here?
[13:26:48] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, because with datatable they have some render: {} options and you can insert functions in that location.  I already had it setup to do this, but not with dynamic "header".  Once I added dynamic headers which are coming from an ajax call I needed a way to also assign these options.  They are pre-defined and won't change, but may take in constants.
[13:27:09] <Sal> hi
[13:27:25] <Phruis`> but all is done server side
[13:27:32] <Cork> Phruis`: so have static functions in the code ex in an object with named keys
[13:27:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:27:39] <Sal> is there a way to let .animate({width: 'show'}) start from display:none to display:inline-block?
[13:27:43] <Cork> then send function names in the json and pick the function you need
[13:27:56] <robertmaxrees> Sal you'd to change that first.
[13:28:08] <Sal> before animate?
[13:28:09] <robertmaxrees> Sal using .css('display', 'inline-block'
[13:28:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[13:28:15] <Sal> ok, thanks
[13:28:19] <Cork> something like headerFunctions = { map: function() {} }; header: headerFunction[map"]
[13:28:34] <Cork> *headerFunction['map']
[13:28:38] <Phruis`> Cork, not familiar with that method I guess
[13:28:39] <Sal> and on hide, after animate restore it, right?
[13:28:57] <Cork> Phruis`: that way you still have static functions but you can pick among them dynamically
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> Sal huh?
[13:29:31] <Cork> Phruis`: and 'map' can be a key in the json data like data.headers.name
[13:29:43] <Cork> or something like that
[13:29:55] <Sal> robertmaxrees, to put it back to display:none
[13:30:17] <Sal> first .animate(...).css(...)
[13:30:18] <Cork> Phruis`: that is what i meant by the comment about set the type in the data earlier to day (thought with a little less info of what you needed it for)
[13:30:19] <Sal> right?
[13:30:23] <robertmaxrees> Sal sure??
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> Sal you mean when you want to hide it?
[13:30:41] <Sal> .animate({width: 'hide'}).css('display', 'none');
[13:31:03] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:31:03] <Sal> .css('display', 'inline-block').animate({width: 'show'});
[13:31:07] <Phruis`> Cork, no i got you and started down that road and I can basically switch to that method but got stuck around how to implement the render function
[13:31:28] <Phruis`> Cork, didn't want to waste to much time on it
[13:31:39] <robertmaxrees> Phruis` that's not wasting time ;)
[13:31:39] <Sal> ok, i'll try, thanks
[13:31:53] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, haha well got a lot to do
[13:32:08] <robertmaxrees> Phruis` invest a little time now and save yourself a lot of time later :)
[13:32:26] <Phruis`> robertmaxrees, i hear ya...
[13:32:29] <Cork> Phruis`: (function() { var renderFunctions = { name: function() {} }; /* ajax function that can reference the render function goes here */ })()
[13:32:44] <Cork> that's about it
[13:33:26] <Sal> robertmaxrees, it doesn't apply the animation.
[13:33:35] <robertmaxrees> Sal can you make a fiddle or something then?
[13:33:46] <robertmaxrees> playing guessing games with what you're trying to do doesn't help :)
[13:33:58] <Sal> when i apply the css(display: inline-block), it shows the content without animation
[13:34:18] <robertmaxrees> probably because you don't have the width set to 0.
[13:34:27] <Sal> robertmaxrees, i'm trying to do an horizontal accordion with <ul> list
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle pls
[13:34:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:34:46] <Sal> i did it vertical using jquery slideUp and SlideDown and its working fine
[13:35:00] <Sal> ok
[13:37:40] <robertparkerx> What is jquery form of window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){});
[13:38:20] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('DOMContentLoaded', function() {});
[13:38:43] <robertparkerx> ty so much robertmaxrees
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> Sal https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fauqy9pj/ just to cut to the chase.
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> here's your freebie for the day ;)
[13:39:49] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx tho i gotta ask - why wait for DOMContentLoaded?
[13:40:13] <robertmaxrees> why not doc ready instead? :)
[13:40:33] <robertparkerx> Well I've defer jquery and other scripts. One of the scripts is owlcarousel. It is not putting the correct size but instead the entire window. It doesn't do that on the site that isn't optimized.
[13:40:55] <robertparkerx> doc ready causses the issue but window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){ works
[13:41:25] <Sal> ok, i'm finishing mine
[13:41:28] <Sal> thanks
[13:42:22] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx one thing to be cautious of is that handler won't fire if you attach it after the event's fired.
[13:44:00] <Sal> robertmaxrees, https://jsbin.com/gemuqobace/edit?html,css,js,output
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> ^ Sal did you see what I didn?
[13:44:23] <Sal> the top list is vertical, the A B C is an horizontal one
[13:44:24] <robertmaxrees> *did
[13:44:27] <Sal> yep
[13:44:42] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[13:44:42] <Sal> and you' not using width: 'show/hide'
[13:45:04] <Sal> so i first need to find the width of my paragraph
[13:45:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm just demonstrating the basics of what you need to do.
[13:45:26] <Sal> and if its hidding, can i still get it?
[13:45:31] <Sal> i don't think so
[13:45:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:46:29] <Sal> robertmaxrees, you put : {'width': 100}
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:46:47] <Sal> i don't know the width of elements that i need to show
[13:46:49] <robertmaxrees> just demonstrating a simplified point :)
[13:46:59] <robertmaxrees> you can take that example and figure out the rest :D
[13:47:10] <Sal> ok, thanks
[13:50:57] <robertparkerx> is there anyway to delay until css is loaded? I don't really know what the problem here is but the size is calculated wrong and as the entire window rather than the "box"
[13:51:49] <robertmaxrees> might need to wait until the window load event.
