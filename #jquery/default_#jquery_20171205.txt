[09:16:54] <codecutter> Have you noticed when you type in facebook, the text slightly increases when decreases once it gets a certain limit?How do achieve this effect?
[09:17:25] <codecutter> then*
[09:19:53] <codecutter> anyone?
[09:30:40] <FilipNortic_> have you tried and checked their css rules
[09:32:39] <codecutter> Noticed how, as you type in facebook text box, font size of the text slightly increases then decreases again as text reaches a certain limit? How do I achieve this effect?
[09:32:43] <poboy> I'm just toggling a class.  This works, but why did I have to add "return false"?  I'm not sure what purpose it's serving.  https://kopy.io/7aGYU
[09:32:54] <codecutter> hope that makes a little more sense
[09:33:07] <codecutter> FilipNortic_: is it all css?
[09:33:11] <Cork> poboy: you don't
[09:33:33] <codecutter> Cork: know what i'm talking about?
[09:33:36] <Cork> poboy: in some cases you might have to use event.preventDefault() to for example prevent a link default action from executing
[09:33:44] <Cork> poboy: but you should avoid using return false
[09:33:54] <Cork> codecutter: haven't even read the question
[09:35:45] <codecutter> i'll wait :)
[09:36:08] <Cork> codecutter: not much point i know very VERY little about facebook
[09:36:41] <codecutter> do you have an fb account?
[09:36:46] <FilipNortic_> and what was wrong with my advice use the browser console and see what you can find out
[09:37:20] <codecutter> FilipNortic_: is it all css?
[09:37:35] <FilipNortic_> the chagnes they make will be css regard less
[09:38:16] <FilipNortic_> if they have some trigger when to apply different rules i doobt anyone here can guess it.
[09:38:28] <codecutter> right!
[11:46:38] <Aquazi> with $("a").has("b").length I can check how many a elements have b as a descendant
[11:47:03] <Aquazi> but how do I check how many a elements have a b element with a specified attribute and value?
[11:47:15] <Aquazi> like I only want <b id="foo">
[11:48:42] <shoky> Aquazi:  .has("b[id='foo']")
[11:48:46] <Aquazi> I tried $("a").has($("b").attr("id", "foo")) but it doesn't work, it returns me all the a cointaining b, regardless of their id value
[11:49:22] <Aquazi> I'll try thx
[11:49:52] <shoky> .attr() is for getting or setting an attribute, not for selecting
[12:15:19] <jadesoturi> anyone around?
[12:15:52] <t532> how do i increase the font size when user starts to type (text area)?
[12:15:58] <t532> can i do with only with css?
[12:16:07] <t532> or do i need you guys?
[12:16:19] <t532> do it*
[12:23:50] <Aquazi> codecutter
[12:23:57] <codecutter> talk to me
[12:24:07] <Aquazi> you could add an event for when the user presses a key
[12:24:17] <codecutter> keypress?
[12:24:48] <Aquazi> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onkeydown.asp
[12:25:02] <Aquazi> well, if he's typing is pressing keys
[12:25:28] <Aquazi> so you can add an event listener that fires just once when he's typing
[12:25:44] <Aquazi> I don't know if you can do it in base css
[12:25:54] <Aquazi> bare css
[12:26:05] <Aquazi> I'll try to do it in pure js on codepen, wait
[12:28:17] <codecutter> ok, thx
[12:54:19] <codecutter> Aquazi: solved
[12:54:32] <Aquazi> good, still trying tho
[12:54:34] <Aquazi> nice exercise
[12:54:42] <codecutter> go for it
[12:57:00] <robertmaxrees> goooooood morning #jquery
[12:57:10] <codecutter> hola!
[12:57:21] <codecutter> welcome mr rob
[12:57:22] <codecutter> :)
[12:57:39] <robertmaxrees> *robert ;)
[12:57:48] <robertmaxrees> how's everybody today?
[12:57:57] <codecutter> apologies
[12:58:05] <codecutter> if i have a div with class 'foo' and i want to determine the size of the font based on the number of chars inside that div, how do i it?
[12:58:30] <robertmaxrees> "the size of the font based on the number of chars" - those two things aren't really linked that way heh
[12:59:57] <codecutter> if the contents of the div.foo is less than 10 chars then font-size should be 10pt, if greater then 20pt
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know the number of characters in a div?
[13:01:08] <Aquazi> .innerHtml().length?
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> it'
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> *i'd use .text().length777
[13:01:26] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[13:01:29] <robertmaxrees> .text().length
[13:01:56] <codecutter> simple enough
[13:01:58] <robertmaxrees> there's also no innerHtml method :)
[13:02:59] <Aquazi> ?
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> there's no $.fn.innerHtml
[13:03:19] <Aquazi> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not jquery.
[13:03:28] <Aquazi> yes, was thinking regardless of jquery
[13:03:30] <robertmaxrees> and that's not a method.
[13:03:44] <robertmaxrees> you'd do .innerHtml.length in that case.
[13:04:08] <robertmaxrees> though i'd probably use innerText if you want non-jquery.
[13:04:11] <Aquazi> yeah, true
[13:04:15] <Aquazi> it's not a method
[13:04:33] <robertmaxrees> but since this is #jquery, pretty safe to assume they want the jquery way to do it :)
[13:04:57] <Aquazi> he asked before if he needed or not jquery to solve it
[13:05:03] <Aquazi> so was providing a non jquery one
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just going offa what i saw :)
[13:14:49] <sbs> hi, I have a problem with a $.post (..., "data=" + JSON.stringify(object))
[13:15:14] <sbs> if object has string members including + signs, the + gets replaced with a space
[13:15:21] <sbs> what is the proper way of encoding this?
[13:16:45] <robertmaxrees> why not just pass the object as that second arg?
[13:17:32] <sbs> the ws expects the thingy in that form
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're trying to pass it as a querystring param.
[13:17:54] <robertmaxrees> and not as a post body.
[13:18:14] <sbs> :) it's a post body in any cases
[13:18:22] <sbs> let me try just sending the object
[13:18:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd fix your backend tbh.
[13:20:59] <robertmaxrees> sbs fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/y8kc8003/1/
[13:21:09] <robertmaxrees> the + doesn't magically become a stgring there.
[13:21:13] <robertmaxrees> err, a space i mean
[13:21:20] <sbs> ok backend yells, but data is properly sent
[13:23:06] <sbs> the jsfiddle does nothing on myside
[13:23:15] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[13:24:07] <sbs> ok gotcha
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> can also do https://jsfiddle.net/y8kc8003/2/ if that's your thing.
[13:30:27] <taplar> robertmaxrees: "i'd fix your backend tbh."  don't say that to the ladies
[13:31:11] <grapheti> pick up lines from robertmaxrees
[13:31:17] <taplar> unless you're like a massage therapist, currently residing in your place of work
[13:32:55] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:43:40] <codecutter> 'oninput' available in jquery?
[14:44:03] <taplar> just 'input'
[15:13:00] <taplar> peppermint is both the best and worst thing ever
[15:13:54] <taplar> just thought you should know that
[15:19:50] <grapheti> how is it the worst?
[15:20:04] <taplar> i've been eating it since friday
[15:20:34] <taplar> everything tastes like peppermint now
[15:25:47] <grapheti> ah
[15:26:00] <grapheti> that would do it
[15:26:24] <grapheti> need variety in your life
[15:27:00] <taplar> i'll take non-wincing swallowing over variety for a while, :)
[15:27:18] <taplar> though i'm pretty sure the worst is behind me
[15:28:33] <grapheti> hawt
[15:28:56] <taplar> anything interesting going on lately?
[15:29:18] <grapheti> not really, website changes, waiting for users to drop so I can update it
[15:29:37] <grapheti> you?
[15:30:03] <taplar> mmm, just staring at my cards a bit trying to figure out where some end and others begin
[15:31:03] <grapheti> cards?
[15:31:21] <taplar> story cards.  the whole agile thing
[15:31:40] <grapheti> ahhh, gotcha
[15:32:24] <grapheti> Make sure you put a 20 on something easy for me.
[15:32:41] <taplar> heh
[15:35:29] <taplar> mmm, and now i'm reading about bitcoin futures.  that sounds scary
[15:37:45] <grapheti> lmao
[15:37:58] <grapheti> I got some monies in bitcoin. Not a lot.
[15:38:06] <grapheti> Like $21.
[15:38:42] <grapheti> now I got $36, big ballin'
[15:38:53] <taplar> heh
[15:39:04] <grapheti> I treat anything stock related as gambling.
[15:39:35] <grapheti> Expect to lose it all, now go have fun.
[15:39:37] <taplar> i thought about setting up a machine to be one of their crucher servers a few years ago, but I hate leaving a machine on all the time at my place.
[15:40:36] <grapheti> maybe put it in a closet with a long cables *shrugs*
[15:40:44] <grapheti> -a*
[15:41:08] <taplar> i'm just too electricity conscious
[15:42:03] <grapheti> worried about your carbon footprint?
[15:42:11] <taplar> like, before i bought my house, i had an apartment that had one of those deadman switches like hotels have
[15:42:19] <taplar> i had a lot of stuff on that guy, :)
[15:42:39] <grapheti> lol
[15:42:51] <taplar> not really, just something about me not being there not actually using it, just bugs me
[15:43:11] <grapheti> if it's on all the time, how are you not using it?
[15:43:21] <taplar> like your modem
[15:43:34] <taplar> or your monitor or power station drawing ghost power, or whatever the phrase is
[15:43:48] <grapheti> yeah, that's the point of the machine to make money
[15:44:10] <taplar> but if you're not home, and you're modem is on, and you're not using it. why?
[15:44:23] <grapheti> I'm not making money from my modem.
[15:44:29] <grapheti> Actually the opposite.
[15:44:37] <robertmaxrees> i remote into my desktop at home all the time.
[15:44:40] <grapheti> It's electricity debt.
[15:45:02] <taplar> i can't really do that here.  they block tunneling from work
[15:45:55] <grapheti> with a bitcoin miner, you just turn it on and collect money
[15:46:16] <grapheti> or lose money*
[15:46:19] <taplar> oh, yeah, i'm not saying that.  i'm talking about in the absence of something making you money
[15:46:42] <grapheti> ah, you can get surge protectors and just turn them off
[15:46:50] <grapheti> in the house
[15:47:06] <grapheti> keep your fridge on tho :3
[15:47:08] <taplar> sure, but the deadman switch was easier, :D.  just leave the room and turn off the lights
[15:47:21] <grapheti> hehe, true
[15:47:36] <taplar> though i did have one of the surge protectors where if my desktop was off, the monitor was powered off too
[15:48:08] <taplar> the desktop controlled the monitor and modem, and the deadman controlled all that.  it was multi tiered, wha hahahaha
[15:48:32] <grapheti> lol
[15:48:37] <grapheti> easier for a cat troll
[15:48:47] <taplar> lol
[15:55:41] <grapheti> I mean, you have breakers in the house don't you?
[15:55:50] <grapheti> turn them all off except the fridge
[15:56:02] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:56:11] <grapheti> :D
[15:56:23] <taplar> they're not labeled, :'(
[15:56:31] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to do.
[15:56:33] <grapheti> figure it out
[15:56:42] <taplar> i know.  just lazy
[15:56:45] <grapheti> :P
[15:57:32] <taplar> that'd be an interesting way to troll the roommate though
[15:57:40] <grapheti> haha
[15:59:12] <grapheti> I got mad at my cousin one time and he was VHS taping 'Woodstock' on MTV and I hit the breakers during it. :P
[15:59:48] <taplar> ouch
[16:00:17] <grapheti> I didn't know much about woodstock. He was pissed tho.
[16:00:49] <grapheti> Now I know it was a pretty big deal. :P
[16:01:28] <taplar> before my time sadly
[16:01:45] <grapheti> well, mine too. I think it was a rerun
[16:01:57] <taplar> ah
[16:01:59] <grapheti> I was born in 1986 and I think I was 10
[16:02:19] * taplar writes down grapheti's personal information
[16:02:30] <grapheti> Google and Facebook already have it.
[16:04:02] <taplar> lol, i always lie.  though that bit me in the azz over the weekend cause i needed to reset my playstation network password and i forgot the birth date i gave them
[16:05:51] <grapheti> just get 1password
[16:05:58] <grapheti> store all the fake info there!
[16:06:53] <grapheti> you can download the app and use it offline only
[16:07:14] <taplar> nah, i got a pattern for my passwords.  i just never login to my psn.  i login to another cause it has all the stuff on it.  I just wanted to try doing it on mine because I started playing BL2 and didn't want to affect my roommates profile.
[16:07:28] <grapheti> also has a mobile app were you can sync it via wifi to update it on your phone
[16:07:43] <grapheti> ah gotcha
[23:06:05] <jak2020> hi all
[23:07:11] <jak2020> Jquery: correct way/code for: display in a div before 20:00 hours (10 minutes before) a label: "in 10:00 minutes the server restarted, in 09:59.... and so on, thanks.
