[09:18:21] <TMC> HI
[09:18:42] <TMC> https://jsfiddle.net/caacastellanosc/ynf7h9g5/1/
[09:19:18] <TMC> I would like to find the element of the list to be able to assign it the active
[09:22:13] <TMC> help me please
[09:34:26] <TMC> Hi
[11:25:43] <Kingsy> Can someone see a problem with submitting a form like this -> var data = $(".form).serialize(); $.post($(".form").attr('action'), data).done(function(data){ } <- I seem to have strange issues where the session is not being passed.
[18:15:19] <baruna> hi.. https://jsfiddle.net/kdL9bhcu/ how can I select all input[data-key] which is not inside table.content?
[18:16:19] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() with a function for that.
[18:17:03] <baruna> robertmaxrees: there is no selector for this?
[18:17:47] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be in a single selector?
[18:18:04] <baruna> robertmaxrees: it doesn't :) I
[18:18:12] <baruna> I'm just curious if there is one
[18:18:41] <robertmaxrees> cramming everything into a selector is generally a bad idea because it gets unreadable very quickly.
[18:19:00] <robertmaxrees> big part of why .filter() with a function is so helpful.
[18:19:57] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ok
[18:20:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:21:32] <robertmaxrees> stuff like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u9vt2h87/2/
[18:25:37] <baruna> robertmaxrees: nice. I would use sth like https://jsfiddle.net/kdL9bhcu/1/
[18:26:09] <baruna> ofc yours is better
[20:47:35] <robertmaxrees> baruna fyi you'd want .hasClass() in your version.
[21:23:55] <baruna> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/2uavLsnp/3/ I just forgot to add the last input.. using the selector only works too
[21:24:16] <robertmaxrees> heh - still wouldn't do that.
[21:25:52] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ok! anyway another question. is there some easy way how to loop through individual attribute values? I mean data-key="A", data-key="A", data-key="B".. data-key="C".. I would like to get "A", "B", "C"
[21:26:09] <robertmaxrees> huh
[21:26:15] <robertmaxrees> ?
[21:26:22] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what you mean?
[21:27:20] <baruna> https://jsfiddle.net/2uavLsnp/3/ let's say I want to do something for each individual data-key value
[21:27:34] <baruna> like set a different color
[21:27:55] <robertmaxrees> .each(function() {})
[21:28:03] <robertmaxrees> and then check $(this).data('key');
[21:28:37] <robertmaxrees> which'll get you the data attribute value - read that, go from there.
[21:29:04] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask - what's with all this rigamorole for stuff you could set server-side instead?
[21:29:12] <robertmaxrees> and apply the appropriate classes, etc.
[21:30:02] <baruna> well no in fact I'm trying to generate a json string, that was a bad example perhaps
[21:30:21] <robertmaxrees> so you mean you want an array of the data-key values?
[21:30:43] <baruna> yes something like this
[21:30:53] <baruna> of course I can do it "manually"
[21:30:58] <robertmaxrees> use .map()
[21:31:25] <baruna> tnx! I'll take a look at it
[21:32:00] <robertmaxrees> that would look like this https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2rxsu0d6/
[21:32:49] <baruna> nice!
[21:34:35] <robertmaxrees> that .get() is important if you want an array.
[21:36:47] <baruna> can I access the array itself from the map function to use $.inArray inside it?
[21:37:03] <robertmaxrees> why would you need that?
[21:37:14] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to dedupe the array?
[21:37:49] <baruna> yes, trying to "unique" it, put each value only once
[21:38:56] <robertmaxrees> treat that as a second step then :)
[21:39:21] <baruna> ok..
[21:39:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2rxsu0d6/1/
[21:39:49] <robertmaxrees> very trivial.
[21:40:07] <robertmaxrees> when dealing with data like this, you want to keep things in smaller discrete "steps" when possible.
[21:40:27] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to cram all your logic into big functions and single lines.  generally much easier to reach.
[21:40:30] <robertmaxrees> *read
[21:41:47] <baruna> robertmaxrees: or perhaps just arrayOfDataKeys = $.unique (arrayOfDataKeys) ;))
[21:42:22] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i tend to avoid using jquery when there's a native JS way instead.
[21:42:23] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[21:43:02] <robertmaxrees> partically because of what the docs currently say about that method :)
[21:43:26] <robertmaxrees> that also adds an additional step, where it sorts the array - that may or may not be what you need.
[21:44:29] <baruna> I don't mind here. anyway I think this is all for today, thank you again very much!!
[21:44:38] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: ok.
[21:54:56] <baruna> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/cdw472kh/ this was what I was trying to accomplish
[21:55:13] <robertmaxrees> why did you keep asking for help if you're just not going to use any of my suggestions?
[21:55:38] <robertmaxrees> also: why not give those elements classes and style them that way instead?
[21:57:17] <baruna> robertmaxrees: I'm definitely using your suggestions! just the $.unique is mine, do you mind? :D
[21:57:31] <robertmaxrees> did you check the docs for that method and see that it's deprecated?
[21:57:44] <baruna> no :/
[21:57:53] <robertmaxrees> that's why i mentioned the docs earlier ;)
[21:58:20] <robertmaxrees> it's an alias now for $.uniqueSort
[21:58:28] <baruna> ah! ok
[21:58:42] <robertmaxrees> i still wouldn't use it since you don't really need it, but :shrug:
[21:59:32] <baruna> anyway in my real task I'll try to generate a json so the table was just an example, of course jquery wouldn't be really needed here
[21:59:43] <robertmaxrees> "a json"?
[21:59:48] <robertmaxrees> you mean an object?
[22:00:06] <robertmaxrees> fwiw JSON is not javascript :)
[22:00:51] <baruna> well json string from form values and I needed individual values for this
[22:00:57] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:01:15] <robertmaxrees> so you're just trying to get the name/value pairs from a form?
[22:01:53] <baruna> I have fields like data-section="notes" data-subsection="references" data-key="template"
[22:02:13] <robertmaxrees> heh, ok...
[22:02:22] <baruna> when there are several of such fields, I want to have them nested.. it's complicated to describe it
[22:03:05] <robertmaxrees> you want an array of objects, each object corresponding to the data attributes for an input?
[22:04:38] <baruna> yes, something like this. but in case there are several forms with same data, let's say the data is "note" and there are several notes, I need to have a list.. etc
[22:04:50] <robertmaxrees> then that dedupe won't work.
[22:05:46] <baruna> it should work :)
[22:05:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[22:06:01] <robertmaxrees> $.uniqueSort don't work on those objects.
[22:06:09] <robertmaxrees> "Sorts an array of DOM elements, in place, with the duplicates removed. Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers."
[22:07:56] <baruna> ok, in that case I don't understand why it worked in my case :D I thought those values were strings :D
[22:08:22] <robertmaxrees> They are - sometimes methods will work in unintended ways.
[22:08:46] <robertmaxrees> but when the docs are pretty clear that it's not supported, it's generally something you want to avoid.
[22:10:15] <baruna> robertmaxrees: ok I have no problems using your function, I wanted to avoid it because I don't really understand how it works :D
[22:10:30] <robertmaxrees> that function won't work for your use-case either.
[22:10:59] <robertmaxrees> you need something a little more in-depth.
[22:13:40] <robertmaxrees> but also: why not make your server do that heavy lifting?  let your frontend just gather the data and ship it over.
[22:16:23] <baruna> robertmaxrees: well honestly.. :D I was trying to do this in python (django) and since I'm not very good at python, it's easier for me to do it this way :D
[22:16:31] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[22:16:45] <robertmaxrees> put your business logic server-side.  great chance to learn how to do it the "right" way :)
[22:17:53] <baruna> I already have a working version server-side as you say but my python script is really horrible.. so I want to make a new version and generate the json locally:D I think it's easier this way
[22:18:17] <robertmaxrees> don't go "easier", go "right".
[22:18:26] <robertmaxrees> if you think your python is "really horrible", solve that problem.
[22:21:35] <baruna> the solution is to read couple books on python probably:D
[22:21:55] <baruna> & django
[22:22:08] <robertmaxrees> nah - get out of books and theory.  get into practical application and asking for help/feedback via chats and the like.
[22:23:54] <baruna> I was trying to and got more help in js channels than in python. I might have an aversion to python now cause there are so many object types.. so many exceptions.. js is definitely easier to star with
[22:24:12] <baruna> *start
[22:24:38] <robertmaxrees> it can be really tempting to take shortcuts like that, but it also leads to bigger bugs that are more difficult to resolve.
[22:25:23] <robertmaxrees> as far as "so many object types" - not sure I follow what you mean there.
[22:29:57] <baruna> afaik in js or lua you can concatenate strings easily with any value, doesn't matter if it's typeof or list, string length.. etc in python each is different object type and you can't do this
[22:31:06] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:31:40] <robertmaxrees> so you're describing a feature in JS called "type coercion", and it's actually a bad thing to rely on.
[22:32:05] <robertmaxrees> javascript has types still, and you need to know what type each object is when working with them.  otherwise you wind up with nasty bugs.
[22:32:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you run into cases where doing foo + bar will behave very differently depending on the types of each of those objects.
[22:35:17] <baruna> robertmaxrees: I understand what you mean. just trying to describe why I prefer JS over python. Plus python gives me trillions stupid errors for mixing tabs and spaces and import errors
[22:35:26] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:35:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:35:39] <robertmaxrees> you want to avoid mixing tabs and spaces in any language.
[22:36:21] <robertmaxrees> and you still need to learn types and how to properly convert between them, regardless of the language.
[22:37:08] <robertmaxrees> also: errors aren't a bad thing.  great way to learn how to be a better engineer.
[22:38:53] <baruna> well I hope to be a lawayer one day, not an engineer :D this is why I'm complainig here. I don't really need to be a programmer at all. just trying to make my project and that I'll never to this again :D or at least for a long time
[22:39:05] <baruna> *lawyer
[22:39:22] <robertmaxrees> if you build it poorly, you'll spend far more time trying to fix errors later.  what's the project you're trying to build?
[22:40:34] <baruna> my project is online law dictionary. trying to build web interface for it so it will be easier to add/edit content
[22:41:18] <robertmaxrees> if you're using django it should be mostly python then :)
[22:42:04] <robertmaxrees> what would make your dictionary different?
[22:43:08] <baruna> there isn't such a dictionary in czech language. I mean not online.
[22:43:36] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[22:45:06] <robertmaxrees> are you planning on making it publicly available?
[22:45:43] <baruna> when I'll have a good web interface, I will be able to find more editors much easily.
[22:45:56] <baruna> sure!
[22:46:18] <robertmaxrees> so another reason to make sure you do this right: improper handling of input can be incredibly dangerous.
[22:46:43] <robertmaxrees> server-side input validation and sanitization is critical in applications like those.
[22:50:11] <baruna> well what should I say.. of course you're right
