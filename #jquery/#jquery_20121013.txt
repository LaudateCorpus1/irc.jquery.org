[00:27:11] <krethan> heyas
[00:27:31] <krethan> i have a problem i was hoping someone could help me with
[00:27:49] <krethan> i want to build a 2D matrix in the browser
[00:28:13] <phiz> ok
[00:28:13] <krethan> i want to divide the screen into Y number of columns and X number of rows
[00:28:27] <krethan> each position will represent 1 character
[00:28:30] <phiz> use bootstrap
[00:28:35] <phiz> oh
[00:28:42] <krethan> bootstrap will do that for me?
[00:28:58] <phiz> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html
[00:29:03] <phiz> perhaps.
[00:29:13] <phiz> check it out.
[00:29:28] <krethan> The main goal right now is to divide the screen persay 24X80
[00:29:54] <phiz> bootstrap is good for various screen widths.
[00:30:02] <phiz> check it out.
[00:31:01] <krethan> it might work thanks
[00:31:22] <krethan> i had a prototype but cannot get the math right
[00:31:32] <phiz>  if it doesn't work for you immediate need it will at least work for other things you didn't know you needed yet :-P
[00:31:44] <krethan> i had divs for the rows
[00:31:51] <krethan> then i put spans into the divs
[00:32:13] <krethan> then tried to set height and width using jquery
[00:32:19] <Brando753> shoky: are you still there? I had a question about the script you showed me, it seems when Im debugging it in firefox that if the browser auto fills in the lines the button remains hidden. But with your script it appears to be checking if the value is null which it is not so I am a little confused by this behaviour
[00:32:46] <Palanivel> Hi Hi Gud afternoon
[00:33:02] <phiz> krethan: only suggestion is keep it simple and stupid.
[00:33:48] <Palanivel> i need small help fron rejax format for float datatype
[00:34:35] <Palanivel> toFixed(2); concept is having but i need to restrict user entry itself
[00:35:05] <Palanivel> after dot only want to allow to enter 2 number only'
[00:35:14] <Palanivel> if have any idea let me know
[00:43:13] <Noeble> question: I wrote a small script using jquery that allows me to hover a div that shows a button during the time I hover the div. The button is clickable, and shows a small dropdown list. This all works fine while Iam inside the div that I hover to show my button. If I then move my mouse outside that div and back in again the click handler on the button that shows wont work
[00:43:33] <Noeble> I have to move and click inside and otuside a couple of times to enable the clickhandler again
[00:43:42] <Noeble> cant manage to figure out why this happens
[00:43:46] <Noeble> code: http://pastebin.com/U6B6M4jC
[01:18:26] <s3d_matt> Hi All
[01:18:40] <s3d_matt> Can anyone help me extract just the postcode from this string: 2 Peel Pl, Southsea, Portsmouth, Southsea, Portsmouth PO5 4JF, UK ?
[01:20:07] <funka> s3d_matt: split by the comma, and select 2nd from last?
[01:20:30] <s3d_matt> funka: how do you do that (I'm good at php, but crap as JS
[01:26:16] <s3d_matt> how can you get the last 3 items of an array?
[01:27:11] <funka> s3d_matt: it is called splitting and splicing, good sir!
[01:27:31] <funka> (i think i spellt thtat properly)
[01:31:42] <manners13> hey guys
[01:31:50] <s3d_matt> thanks funkla
[01:31:54] <s3d_matt> hi manners13
[01:34:04] <shoky> Brando753: like i said you might need a combo of events. for autocomplete i know that 'input' event works (at least sometimes..)
[01:34:40] <manners13> i currently use dynatree to display a directory tree which outputs the selected chekboxes to another page however this displays every selected node as a comma seperated value, ie c, documents and settings, text.txt, text2.txt is there a way to change it so each value will include the full path
[01:34:54] <s3d_matt> In a called back (cb:) how do you set a different text input field's value?
[01:36:09] <manners13> so i would end up with c, c\documents and settings, c\documents and settings\text.txt, c\documents and settings\text2.txt,
[01:37:29] <manners13> http://codepad.org/ejQpVPUZ
[01:38:08] <manners13> i know its the return part but what do i need to set it as or where can i get an idea of what to set it as lol
[01:39:32] <s3d_matt> Anyone look at this, where do I put the document.getElementâ€¦ line, to update another field when the autocomplete has been selected: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1276394/
[02:15:07] <Xtrivity> Cork: are you around?
[02:19:41] <Xtrivity> Alright lets see if we got some Saturday genius' on here. I am having troubles with pushstate. Here's the code I have right now: http://pastie.org/5051494 . Essentially when I get a null state and I go back to it - it breaks (animation doens't work... etc) also if I hit the backbutton twice it stays as the last pushstate - not sure why. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[02:23:22] <Xtrivity> I'm struggling because if pushstate does not exist on page load - but returns null on back - it's like non exist and null are different things.
[02:23:40] <BinaryKitten> they are
[02:23:49] <Xtrivity> i'm not sure how to test against that though.
[02:24:04] <BinaryKitten> if typeof item === 'undefined'
[02:24:14] <BinaryKitten> else if item === null
[02:25:29] <BinaryKitten> if you use an IIFE
[02:25:49] <BinaryKitten> you can define undefined to an undefined defined variable argument
[02:25:55] <BinaryKitten> hows that for convoluted
[02:25:58] <Xtrivity> haha
[02:26:38] <Xtrivity> BinaryKitten. I am wondering though. On page load a pushstate appears as null (when essentially it should be undefined)
[02:26:52] <Xtrivity> and on back button it appears null as well (where it shows correctly as null)
[02:27:23] <Xtrivity> but both output null (which essentially is incorrect) cause if there is no pushstate how can it be null
[02:27:24] <BinaryKitten> Xtrivity: IIFE http://pastie.org/5051530
[02:28:19] <BinaryKitten> Xtrivity: i don't really know ..
[02:28:29] <BinaryKitten> where is the pushstate coming from?
[02:28:46] <BinaryKitten> i mean how are you loading it as there isn't anything by default
[02:29:44] <Xtrivity> I'm loading pushstate onclick
[02:30:29] <BinaryKitten> right
[02:30:58] <BinaryKitten> but where are you getting the data from.. because by default the browser doesn't do/have anything for push state
[02:31:26] <Xtrivity> ajax request using load()
[02:31:40] <Xtrivity> load("home") etc.
[02:32:31] <sahbeewah> exit
[02:32:56] <Xtrivity> BinaryKitten: did you look at my pastie. should explain how i've done things.
[02:33:25] <BinaryKitten> ah right
[02:33:30] <Xtrivity> http://pastie.org/5051494
[02:33:45] <BinaryKitten> sorry most of the time i've seen people wrap things for #tag etc
[02:33:55] <BinaryKitten> not seen history.pushState
[02:34:12] <Xtrivity> it's in the function
[02:34:57] <BinaryKitten> Xtrivity third param = url
[02:35:03] <BinaryKitten> state, title, url
[02:35:15] <BinaryKitten> what is the url
[02:35:19] <Xtrivity> home
[02:35:22] <Xtrivity> would be the url for example
[02:35:25] <BinaryKitten> just home
[02:35:28] <BinaryKitten> not /home
[02:35:33] <Xtrivity> correct.
[02:37:00] <BinaryKitten> are you using any helper libs?
[02:37:55] <Xtrivity> i'm using htaccess to change the URLS for example index.php to home and about.php to about
[02:38:00] <Xtrivity> but no helper libs - no.

[03:51:33] <javalover> is that just like a div with an animation in it?
[04:12:42] <danmichel> i did everything they did in this example http://www.evanwebdesign.com/responsive-web-design/example5.html here http://test.varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco/corradodalco-029/ and it's not working. the image is supposed to shrink. thanks in advance for any help .the script http://pastebin.com/NTr3gjSL the page: http://pastebin.com/d6YryTqG the CSS: http://pastebin.com/EHSKwFHT as this page is now http://test.varmag.com/sara-cardillo
[04:21:00] <ravenzz> danmichel why are you using javascript for images resizing?
[04:21:52] <danmichel> because i can't accomplish this http://d.pr/i/Obya with pure css ravenzz
[04:22:30] <ravenzz> what is "this"?
[04:23:24] <danmichel> see how the image shrinks down and the sidebar stays the same width and never disappears ravenzz?
[04:24:15] <danmichel> My problem here is that at a certain point, the #gallery_sidebar div disappears when you drink the window. My goal is to shrink the image on the left infinitely but have the #gallery_sidebar stay the same width and height and never disappear. it's important that a portrait image stay 100% height of the browser window and that a landscape photo stay 100% width of the #fullsize container.  http://test.varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco
[04:24:51] <danmichel> the above is for the live site varmag.com ravenzz. i made changes to test.varmag.com http://varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco/corradodalco-029/
[04:25:17] <danmichel> what i want to do ultimately is that i said above when "my problem is"
[04:25:58] <danmichel> and you can see what i started out with on http://varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco/corradodalco-029/
[04:26:16] <danmichel> what i tried to do to make that happen is on http://test.varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco/corradodalco-029/
[04:26:30] <danmichel> using what they did here http://www.evanwebdesign.com/responsive-web-design/example5.html
[04:27:14] <ravenzz> oh dude
[04:27:24] <danmichel> yes, ravenzz
[04:27:26] <ravenzz> I think we talked about the
[04:27:33] <ravenzz> 100% height on #css
[04:28:01] <danmichel> i think so
[04:35:33] <ravenzz> danmichel buh this is the css ver http://jsfiddle.net/HXSRP/1/
[04:37:21] <danmichel> yes ravenzz, but that would stretch landscape images ravenzz. and i would still have the problem with the disappearing sidebar
[04:37:44] <ravenzz> infact this is the portrait version
[04:37:50] <ravenzz> .pic-portrait <-
[04:38:11] <ravenzz> you are going to need the landscape one too
[04:38:46] <ravenzz> and set the class in php dependig on the image size
[04:40:08] <danmichel> the thing the tneeds to haven is the div containing th image needs to dynamically shrink so the sidebar doesn't disappear
[04:42:20] <ravenzz> at some point it will disappear
[04:42:44] <ravenzz> is up to you to find a design solution
[04:43:05] <ravenzz> maybe at some point you can move it below the image
[04:43:58] <danmichel> thats what happened now ravenzz. which is why it disappears. but the page is overflow:hidden . i don't want that to happen
[04:44:08] <danmichel> so i need JS to shrink the div
[06:01:39] <batmanbond3d> Hey all
[06:02:13] <batmanbond3d> I am looking for some feedback on something I made, I would like to know what tools you would use to achieve something like this and if any such tools exist
[06:02:45] <batmanbond3d> I am thinking of starting my own framework base on what I made, basically cleaning up the framework code and then open sourcing it

[06:34:27] <Mac> Hi every one
[06:35:16] <Mac> i have a problem when i use multiple instance of jquery tabs on one page they nest i want to seprate them if thats possible?
[06:36:02] <batmanbond3dd> you mean jquery ui tabs?
[06:36:35] <Mac> yes
[06:36:43] <batmanbond3dd> what do you mean they nest?
[06:37:45] <Mac> they nest in style way that the first one style include the other one inside it and the third one include the second one
[06:39:20] <batmanbond3dd> I didn't even know you can change the style of them, usually you are stuck with the style defined in the jquery ui css
[06:41:42] <Mac> Thank god i managed to fix it right now i just needed to thow a new div around each tab div
[06:42:19] <batmanbond3dd> :)
[06:42:46] <Mac> thanks for the help btw u can alter the css using external style cheat with your hacks on it and include it after the main css
[06:43:10] <Mac> on internal so you make your style cascade !!!
[06:43:20] <Mac> or*
[06:43:50] <batmanbond3dd> ok
[06:52:01] <AGM114K2A>  I'm looking for some help with a really small script.  I'm trying to get the data in a <span> to change text with a .mouseover() in JQ, had it working once and changed something and can't get it back.  http://jsbin.com/oqayes/1/
[07:09:55] <LSshock> hi, i have a click, function(){} going with an if inside, this makes sure one item is opened so if its true it will remove the others, if there isnt any other it will just run the else {} part â€” this is fine except it will not show the new item that way, is the only way to do this for me to put the else part outside of the click as an function? i was hoping doing $(this).click(); would have been enough but that gets called infinitely
[07:18:40] <xsamurai> Is this the right syntax to refer to an object name via a variable http://jsfiddle.net/TUJvK/1/
[07:18:43] <xsamurai> ?
[07:20:26] <AGM114K2A> xsamurai: Are you talking about something like...  var $this = $(this);
[07:20:45] <batmanbond3d> what is obj[testvar]
[07:20:57] <batmanbond3d> it is causing the jsfiddle to crash
[07:21:02] <AGM114K2A> xsamurai: then from there after you can do stuff like $this.fadeTo() etc
[07:21:21] <xsamurai> AGM114K2A: not really , more like getelementby name or id might work better
[07:21:42] <xsamurai> batmanbond3d: yeah i was just throwing that out there =)
[07:22:13] <batmanbond3d> perhaps you want $('#' + testvar).attr('name')
[07:22:35] <batmanbond3d> instead of obj[testvar].attr('name')
[07:23:26] <xsamurai> batmanbond3d: nice that works well
[07:23:39] <batmanbond3d> np, is that what you wanted?
[07:23:44] <xsamurai> yep exactly
[07:24:11] <xsamurai> thanks

[08:12:48] <toromata> hi, it is posible register a global ajax event with event data; p.e $('#some').ajaxComplete(myHandle, myData) so myData is available at event.data when the event is triggered
[08:15:36] <pachet> sure, but not ootb
[08:15:56] <pachet> you'd have to write some kind of wrapper for .ajax that passes the success parameters into an event that you can pass around via custom events

[08:32:17] <cpierce> since you are just hiding the button
[08:32:25] <cpierce> don't put your click stuff on it inside the hover function
[08:32:42] <cpierce> build that outside the function and then it won't give you the problem you are experiencing
[08:32:50] <lakcaj> Is there anything wrong with wrapping all my javascript/jquery in $(document).ready(function() ...     ?
[08:33:03] <cpierce> lakcaj: in most cases no
[08:33:11] <lakcaj> ok, thanks
[08:33:27] <cpierce> Noeble: that last few was for you
[08:34:52] <cpierce> Noeble: you could also unbind the click function you set each time you hid the button but thats a little more useless work in my opinion
[08:40:03] <Noeble> cpierce_: good points, lemme try it

[09:06:43] <jn_> argh this is killing me :)
[09:12:46] <xenaxon> guys, I'm trying to cycle through images in a div and show one
[09:12:48] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/2/
[09:13:03] <xenaxon> can anyone look at this, I just can't figure it out
[09:16:35] <LSshock> hi, all i need to do is generate some lists based on a total number (right now 96) and make that lists of 12 and every 3 lists, start a new row (new div where they are in) What would be the best approach to do this?
[09:17:20] <LSshock> Just a list with numbers, so starting with 1-12 13-25 so on
[09:19:50] <Klowner> LSshock: in what, wha?
[09:20:21] <LSshock> yeah i know it sounds weird but thats the base that i need to continue (the parts i do know how to do)
[09:20:52] <LSshock> so just have a lists until it gets to 96, each list is 12 numbers and every 52 it starts a new row
[09:21:32] <Klowner> var markup = ''; and then a couple nested loops to append to markup?
[09:24:43] <SmokingSlim> http://jsfiddle.net/dqbLZ/ any one know why this badboys is acting up in firefox and not chrome?
[09:24:52] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/7/ - added some missing curlies/parens & included jquery as the lib (still not working, but at least now your code's not throwing errors)
[09:29:39] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: thanks, but I still don't understand why the arrows are not showing up on jsfiddle, because they are showing up on my server
[09:30:00] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: just found the problem - the urls are relative
[09:31:02] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: yeah, but the buttons should still show up, because they have a white background
[09:31:06] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: unless jsfiddle has a way to upload images or a handy set of default images available to all fiddles, they need the domain/path
[09:31:29] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: yeah, but the buttons should still show up, because they have a white background
[09:31:56] <CrawfordComeaux> k
[09:32:23] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: do the buttons show up in your browser? I can only see the images
[09:35:07] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: the navbuttons don't take the width and height set in css, they have a 50% width, although the width is set
[09:35:17] <CrawfordComeaux> yeah...i'm seeing that...weird
[09:37:54] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: I forgot to se their common class...
[09:38:10] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/11/
[09:38:31] <xenaxon> but still the divs are not aligned to the .bbMedia div
[09:40:20] <xenaxon> and the buttons aren't even vertically centered, and they are on my local server
[09:40:27] <xenaxon> not sure if this is a jsfiddle problem
[09:40:34] <xenaxon> but it's the exact same code
[09:41:01] <xenaxon> but still the main problem remains, it doesn't cycle through the images
[09:42:27] <CrawfordComeaux> "Unexpected token }" in chrome
[09:43:49] <xenaxon> there was an extra }... deleted, and still nothing
[09:43:55] <CrawfordComeaux> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/12/
[09:44:58] <nile> In jQ, does $(this) in: $(control).addClass($(this).val()); refer to $(control) or the scope that the statement is in?
[09:45:14] <CrawfordComeaux> it's more than just an extra }...the first .each needed to be properly closed, too.
[09:46:02] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/14/
[09:46:30] <danmichel> My problem here is that at a certain point, the #gallery_sidebar div disappears when you drink the window. My goal is to shrink the image on the left infinitely but have the #gallery_sidebar stay the same width and height and never disappear. it's important that a portrait image stay 100% height of the browser window and that a landscape photo stay 100% width of the #fullsize container.  http://varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco/corr
[09:46:45] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/15/
[09:46:54] <danmichel> i did everything they did in this example http://www.evanwebdesign.com/responsive-web-design/example5.html here http://test.varmag.com/sara-cardillo-by-corrado-dalco/corradodalco-029/ and it's not working. the image is supposed to shrink. thanks in advance for any help .the script http://pastebin.com/NTr3gjSL the page: http://pastebin.com/d6YryTqG the CSS: http://pastebin.com/EHSKwFHT as this page is now http://test.varmag.com/sara-cardillo
[09:46:54] <xenaxon> update 15, check this one out, I fixed some problems
[09:46:54] <nile> In jQ, does $(this) in: $(control).addClass($(this).val()); refer to $(control) or the scope that the statement is in?
[09:47:02] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: what browser are you working in?
[09:47:04] <danmichel> Note: test.varmag.com and varmag.com links are 2 separate examples
[09:47:10] <xenaxon> right now, firefox
[09:47:14] <CrawfordComeaux> using firebug
[09:47:15] <CrawfordComeaux> ?
[09:47:35] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/16/
[09:47:37] <xenaxon> yes
[09:48:49] <CrawfordComeaux> remove () after .length
[09:51:48] <xenaxon> done, and I placed an alert(numberOfImages) and it returns 0, and there are 2 images, so it's not returning the right count
[09:53:11] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: (a not-trying-to-be-critical) protip - watch the console tab when js isn't working to avoid posting fiddles w/syntax problems
[09:56:21] <xenaxon> ok
[09:56:22] <xenaxon> srry
[09:56:54] <CrawfordComeaux> no worries :D
[09:56:55] <xenaxon> I'm not very experienced with javascript/firebug
[09:57:20] <CrawfordComeaux> it's cool...I'm not very experienced w/jquery, but who knows :P
[10:02:18] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: I think it's something with the $(this).parent statement
[10:02:35] <xenaxon> it's not finding any img's inside, and there are !
[10:02:55] <CrawfordComeaux> yeah
[10:04:31] <CrawfordComeaux> just got this to work: $("img",this.parentNode).length ...trying to find jquery alternative to parentNode for shits & giggles
[10:05:08] <CrawfordComeaux> and here we go: $("img",$(this).parent())
[10:06:49] <xenaxon> :))
[10:07:15] <xenaxon> press update
[10:07:28] <CrawfordComeaux> kk
[10:09:52] <CrawfordComeaux> now we just need to figure out the right way to rewrite $(this).parent(".bbMedia img") cause that's selecting nothing right now
[10:10:08] <CrawfordComeaux> oh...but I guess the same selector should work there :P
[10:11:20] <xenaxon> check my update: http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/26/
[10:12:04] <xenaxon> use this update please, because I've fixed a few things
[10:12:22] <CrawfordComeaux> k
[10:13:53] <CrawfordComeaux> dunno what you changed, but check out http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/27/
[10:14:32] <CrawfordComeaux> it probably doesn't have some of your changes, but I think it might be closer to what you're looking to achieve
[10:16:16] <xenaxon> yeah, but it needs to cycle through the images
[10:16:27] <CrawfordComeaux> right
[10:17:05] <xenaxon> strangely,  alert(index) doesn't return anything in the each loop
[10:17:15] <gataraid> If I am using animate in somewhat of a loop, how would you reset each instance
[10:17:37] <gataraid> it seems after the first round of the loop, the animated item is in the last remaining spot from there on out
[10:17:40] <xenaxon> ok, forget about that, i fixed it
[10:17:52] <xenaxon> now just need to make it cycle throuh
[10:18:42] <CrawfordComeaux> I'd add display:none to the img classes instead of calling .hide()...it's a little cleaner
[10:19:19] <CrawfordComeaux> .hide() is useful if you've got an initial display to preserve
[10:20:41] <CrawfordComeaux> and display:hidden isn't right...it's display:none (item not shown & doesn't take up space) or visibility:hidden (item not shown, but does take up space)
[10:20:56] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: latest update link?
[10:21:08] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/31/
[10:21:11] <xenaxon> work on this
[10:21:23] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: got a fiddle to play?
[10:21:29] <xenaxon> sorry, not that
[10:21:30] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/34/
[10:21:38] <xenaxon> this one
[10:21:39] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: jsfiddle, that is
[10:21:47] <hyper_ch> hi there, I'm trying the new tooltip tool from jqueryui... however I struggle on how I can load the content of another page into the tooltip. Any pointers?
[10:24:59] <gataraid> I will make a fiddle yea
[10:26:28] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: why you gotta keep breaking my fixes, son? ;)
[10:26:42] <CrawfordComeaux> I had that other image showing earlier
[10:27:39] <gataraid> http://jsfiddle.net/LJrGz/1/
[10:28:17] <xenaxon> to show the other image is not the problem
[10:28:23] <xenaxon> it has to be hidden at first
[10:28:34] <xenaxon> and then it has to become visible
[10:28:45] <xenaxon> it's no use to have it visible the whole time
[10:28:51] <xenaxon> so what I've done is one step further
[10:28:56] <CrawfordComeaux> k
[10:30:08] <CrawfordComeaux> so run me through the desired behavior. page loads, you see dark bg jquery logo?
[10:30:25] <gataraid> nevermind, I got what I needed done
[10:31:04] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: sweet...was just taking a peek at yours. what was the fix?
[10:31:25] <xenaxon> the div bbmedia, will contain more than one image
[10:31:28] <xenaxon> like a slideshow
[10:32:10] <xenaxon> and when you click the previous/next button, it fades out the current image, and fades in the next/previous depending on which button you pressed
[10:32:15] <CrawfordComeaux> right...but when it loads, dark logo is to be shown first?
[10:32:19] <xenaxon> so basically it cycles through some images
[10:32:28] <xenaxon> it doesn't matter which one
[10:32:32] <CrawfordComeaux> ok
[10:32:42] <CrawfordComeaux> brb...bio
[10:32:45] <xenaxon> the first image in the .bbmedia div, will show first
[10:32:46] <xenaxon> ok
[10:33:14] <gataraid> could I actually animate something and perform a .fadeOut while the item is still performing the animate ?
[10:37:38] <adavia> is there anyway to make twitter bootstrap modal draggable?
[10:53:27] <hyper_ch> hi there, I'm trying the new tooltip tool from jqueryui... however I struggle on how I can load the content of another page into the tooltip. Any pointers?   current code is here:  http://dragon.sjau.ch/
[11:06:14] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. I'm working on a ajax request. Unfortunately i'm not having to much luck. Everytime I try the page refresh's but i'm not sure why or where it would cause a page to refresh: http://pastie.org/5053431
[11:27:55] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: sorry about that...ever get it figured out?
[11:28:15] <xenaxon> almost
[11:28:26] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/RRx3K/40/
[11:28:30] <xenaxon> check it out
[11:31:37] <danmichel> Can anyone point me in the right direction as to why Modernizr is prepending 'var' in 'html? http://varmag.com/
[11:32:23] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: looks good. what's left?
[11:33:31] <xenaxon> when I test it on my server, it's switches ok for 2-3 times
[11:33:51] <hyper_ch> I'm trying the new tooltip tool from jqueryui... however I struggle on how I can load the content of another page into the tooltip. Any pointers?   current code is here:  http://dragon.sjau.ch/
[11:33:54] <xenaxon> and then, it switches to the same one for 2-3 times, and then starts working again
[11:34:09] <xenaxon> but it works fine on jsfiddle
[11:34:13] <xenaxon> no idea why not on my server
[11:34:42] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: the issue goes away if you don't include modernizr?
[11:34:57] <danmichel> yes CrawfordComeaux
[11:35:04] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: got a live version I can see?
[11:35:39] <xenaxon> ok wait, I used the same image 3 times
[11:35:39] <xenaxon> :))))
[11:35:48] <xenaxon> it works
[11:36:02] <danmichel> that is a live version CrawfordComeaux
[11:37:30] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: yeah, that was meant for xenaxon. Is there anything on the backend that could be causing it? what's the backend stack like?
[11:37:57] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: thanks allot for the help. Now maybe the code could be simplified somehow, but I don't think so
[11:39:34] <xenaxon> is there any way of giving a class only to the first out of a set of matched elements?
[11:40:16] <CrawfordComeaux> the :first psuedoclass I think
[11:41:13] <danmichel> thanks CrawfordComeaux, but i don't think ill be needing Modernizr anyway. i just deleted it
[11:42:03] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: or .first() in jquery
[11:42:21] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: ok...that's still really odd, though. maybe is has something to do with WP?
[11:42:33] <danmichel> i guess
[11:42:35] <xenaxon> eq(0) i think works best
[11:42:41] <xenaxon> what do you think?
[11:43:02] <danmichel> i have another jquery issue I've been trying to figure out for weeks. couldn't worry about this one
[11:43:46] <CrawfordComeaux> would have to see it in the code, but when you've got multiple options that accomplish the same thing & there's no performance diff, go with the one that's easiest to understand. For me, that'd be first(), but up to you
[11:44:06] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: lemme check it out...one sec
[11:44:12] <gataraid> does anyone else have problems with .animate and using fontSize with the animation being all jumpy?
[11:44:24] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: thx :)
[11:44:49] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: are you trying to get the font size to grow?
[11:45:16] <gataraid> yes
[11:45:25] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: are you just including modernizr or using a plugin?
[11:45:32] <gataraid> when I add a larger fontSize to the animate, it is rather jumpy
[11:45:39] <gataraid> it's not as smooth as everything else
[11:45:49] <danmichel> was enqueuing it CrawfordComeaux
[11:47:01] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: maybe give the plugin a shot? *shrug* even if you're not going to keep it, just to see what happens...I'm curious :P
[11:47:09] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: what browser you using?
[11:47:21] <danmichel> ok, ill install the plugin now
[11:47:58] <gataraid> crawford, firefox
[11:49:00] <danmichel> yeah, looks like it's fine with the plugin CrawfordComeaux
[11:49:33] <gataraid> CrawfordComeaux, if it is any different - I am also moving the text while the text is upscaling
[11:49:36] <xenaxon> CrawfordComeaux: well, this failed: $(".bbMedia img:first").addClass("bbImageCurrentlyVisible");
[11:49:42] <gataraid> but while it's upscaling, it's rather jumpy
[11:50:02] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: what are you trying to add a tooltip to?
[11:50:13] <gataraid> well, while it moves and upscaling - it is rather jumpy and not smooth at all
[11:50:20] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: right now just some text like  http://dragon.sjau.ch/breed.php?id=14
[11:50:23] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: my bad...it's :first-child
[11:50:29] <hyper_ch> and formatting and making it pretty once it works
[11:50:58] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: fiddle?
[11:51:16] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: but what element is the tooltip supposed to show up on?
[11:51:34] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: upon hovering over the link
[11:51:48] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: I tried to imitate the jqueryui example that displays google maps
[11:52:01] <CrawfordComeaux> k
[11:52:08] <xenaxon> $(".bbMedia img:first-child").addClass("bbImageCurrentlyVisible");
[11:52:11] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[11:52:18] <xenaxon> how do I select the first child of type img?
[11:52:27] <xenaxon> the first child is not an img... it's a div
[11:52:36] <xenaxon> and I only want to select the first child of type img
[11:52:40] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: in there, a custom tag was defined in the link and then filtered through and displays google map
[11:56:00] <CrawfordComeaux> xenaxon: fiddle?
[11:56:26] <xenaxon> no need, fixed it
[11:56:51] <and7ey> hi! http://jsfiddle.net/and7ey/rdySt/ - if I have element, how can I get label for element.name?

[12:12:59] <CrawfordComeaux> and7ey: rockin :)
[12:13:13] <tipdbmp> ravenzz, what is it?
[12:13:18] <ravenzz> exactly
[12:13:22] <danmichel> Maybe you can help me CrawfordComeaux http://varmag.com/olga-maliouk-by-miko-lim/_mg_2492rb_argb_final/ My problem here is that at a certain point, the #gallery_sidebar div disappears when you drink the window. My goal is to shrink the image on the left infinitely but have the #gallery_sidebar stay the same width and height and never disappear. it's important that a portrait image stay 100% height of the browser window and that a landscape 
[12:13:35] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: if you could look again: you got any idea why it doesn't always show the tooltip while being over the link?
[12:13:45] <tipdbmp> okay..., tnx.
[12:13:47] <ravenzz> tipdbmp https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[12:14:07] <ravenzz> or you can always use the jQuery each
[12:14:25] <Mariaa> hi, i have put on a slider , jquery and jquery ui are loaded but i get an error, here it is http://pastie.org/5051681
[12:17:03] <CrawfordComeaux> tipdbmp: according to this, for-in loops through properties of an object, not elements of an array http://stackoverflow.com/a/5337605
[12:17:16] <ravenzz> Mariaa if you want to check if jQuery is defined check if window.jQuery is truthy
[12:17:53] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Mariaa
[12:17:54] <bot-t> Mariaa, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:18:26] <Mariaa> ravenzz: i have checked it is loaded
[12:18:32] <ravenzz> ok np
[12:18:50] <ravenzz> but still you should create a live demo
[12:18:55] <CrawfordComeaux> tipdbmp: could always just use nested for loops. for-in would be better for an associative array, I think
[12:19:05] <ravenzz> otherwise is hard to help
[12:19:09] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: in a sec...still trying to answer others ;)
[12:19:17] <danmichel> thanks CrawfordComeaux
[12:20:33] <CrawfordComeaux> gataraid: can you link to the latest fiddle?
[12:21:23] <tipdbmp> CrawfordCameux, I went with using the forEach loops, although they do make a lot of '});', but I guess that's "normal". =)
[12:25:27] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: does float:left on the img get you closer to where you want to be?
[12:26:26] <danmichel> no CrawfordComeaux. the sidebar still disappears. i think I'm going to need a jquery script for it
[12:26:48] <danmichel> to shrink the image infinitely without bothering the #gallery_sidebar
[12:27:40] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: can you throw up a quick screenshot of what you're seeing when you say the sidebar's disappeared?
[12:28:23] <danmichel> this is what should happen CrawfordComeaux http://d.pr/i/R2DQ i can imagine the only way to make that happen is by dynamically shrinking the div containing the image using jquery
[12:29:05] <adavia> anyone uses twitter bootstrap here
[12:29:08] <adavia> ?
[12:29:10] <adavia> ?
[12:29:28] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: I have a while back & will be again later today.
[12:29:52] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: is the purpose of handling the shrinking window for display on mobile devices?
[12:29:55] <danmichel> oh, I'm sorry. in this example, the sidebar just goes over the image because it's position is absolute. i don't want that either. earlier it was disappearing when i removed the absolute positioning CrawfordComeaux
[12:30:20] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  huh?
[12:30:38] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: yes...i use bootstrap
[12:30:53] <danmichel> no CrawfordComeaux. that one is gonna be a whole nother  week for me to figure out. for mobile devices, i want the max height of the image to be 50% of the window
[12:31:39] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  im using a modal form which is being called using ajax... the problem is im not able to close the form.. i can submit it but not close it even from the header or the cancel button.. so i guess the data-toggle="modal" attribute is not working as i cannot use data-dismiss="modal"
[12:31:47] <danmichel> where on non-mobile, it should be 100% in height at max if it's portraight and 100% in width as long as it doesn't bother the sidebar if its landscape CrawfordComeaux
[12:32:06] <tw2113> media queries danm
[12:32:09] <tw2113> danmichel,
[12:32:09] <objnoob> i'm creating a plugin that attaches to the window object -- i'm just wondering if i store a timeout object in the data object i created or right to the window object
[12:32:10] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: what happens if you put some static content into the tooltip instead? does it still misbehave?
[12:32:25] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: yes
[12:32:34] <danmichel> yes tw2113, I'm still trying to get this done :)
[12:32:38] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: you see that behaviour? that it only 'seldomly' displays the tooltip?
[12:32:44] <danmichel> the mobile thing can be done later tw2113
[12:32:47] <tw2113> i'm not arguing against that
[12:32:52] <danmichel> for now i need to figure this one out
[12:33:42] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: so you want the image to shrink up into the corner of the window as the window's resized?
[12:33:53] <tw2113> and i'm proposing a solution to this
[12:34:01] <tw2113> especially since you're resizing browser viewports
[12:34:02] <danmichel> CrawfordComeaux: tw2113 can tell you I've been trying to do this for about a week straight now. I've been doing nothing else. tried many scripts
[12:34:09] <tw2113> which is what media queries are supposed to handle
[12:34:11] <danmichel> yes CrawfordComeaux
[12:34:19] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: can you give a live demo or jsfiddle?
[12:34:39] <adavia> ok
[12:35:23] <CrawfordComeaux> danmichel: I'd give tw2113's advice a shot before trying anything else. If it gets you where you need to be, it'll port to the mobile version pretty easily.
[12:36:04] <danmichel> tw2113 wouldn't that just give you a size for the image on load and not do anything about it when you shrink the window?
[12:36:27] <loodwig> I'm running into an issue with dynamically adding jquery elements to a page.  I am able to insert html without issue, but I'm not sure what terminology I should search for regarding adding html that should be affected by jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/sKUDt/
[12:38:00] <loodwig> I'm guessing I'm missing something obvious with jQuery, as with ExtJs (the library I'm more familiar with), I'd just Ext.Create the component and apply it to the dom or parent component.
[12:38:04] <tw2113> danmichel, you can set width/height stuff to percentages and it'll shift based on that after certain breakpoints in window dimensions
[12:38:26] <danmichel> i see
[12:38:49] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  guees it would be something like this
[12:38:51] <danmichel> ill give it a shot tw2113
[12:38:52] <adavia> http://jsfiddle.net/BV2XA/1/
[12:39:07] <tw2113> it's a huge hot topic these days
[12:39:11] <tw2113> do some reading
[12:39:53] <Eviltwin> Responsive design?
[12:40:17] <tw2113> yeah
[12:46:14] <adavia> =/
[12:48:03] <MrFox> "Unfortunately, you do not have rights to create a Virtual Host. You must have write permissions on the file: C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" says a wamp package called easyphp. anyone with an idea
[12:48:20] <sjeijk> any around that can point me in the right direction? I need my submenu from a drop down pure css menu to close with a delay of 1s working menu is found in this website www.paushuize.nl
[12:49:43] <MrFox> sorry! wrong tab i was typing in.
[12:49:46] <sjeijk> because i want the sub menu to be accessible when people drag their mouse diagonal for picking a menu
[12:49:58] <loodwig> nvm, I think I just figured it out.  When dynamically loading in something, you need to invoke a method on it after it's inserted ($('div[data-role=collapsible]').collapsible();)
[12:53:57] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: It works fine with static content here, so I think it may have something to do with your ajax calls.  http://jsfiddle.net/qkYy8/5/
[12:54:11] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: Also, why are you setting async: false?
[12:55:16] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux: http://jsfiddle.net/BV2XA/1/
[12:56:31] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: because I saw that somewhere
[12:56:32] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: looking now
[12:56:56] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: ok...unsure if that's correct
[12:58:02] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: for me it only seems to work when the curors is over the line of a letter
[12:58:12] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: if it's not exactely on the line, nothing shows up
[13:01:25] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: and you're right... as soon as I try to return the result from the ajax call, it only works when hovering over the actual letter lines... if I just have some static content shown up, like the title attr it works fine
[13:03:05] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: actually, I just did limit the result of the ajax call to one element.... now it works perfect... it seems there's problems when the hover is bigger than the screen or canvas size of the browser
[13:04:35] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: thx for all the help
[13:06:26] <objnoob> why does $(document).mousemove(function(e){ alert('mouse move'); }      keep firing?? even when i use the enter key to ok the alert
[13:06:57] <objnoob> seems like mouse over triggers it, because when mouse is over a different window and i hit enter the alert doesnt pop
[13:10:31] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: are you triggering the modal with a button or something?
[13:10:42] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  right
[13:11:21] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: makes sense. glad I could help! (and yeah...wtf were you doing trying to retrieve those huge files for a tooltip? :P )
[13:11:44] <hyper_ch> they aren't that huge
[13:17:34] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: some of those were 20+ lines :P
[13:17:49] <hyper_ch> depends... sometimes more like 500
[13:18:12] <CrawfordComeaux> as contents for a tooltip, that's just silly
[13:18:13] <hyper_ch> need to put it into columns
[13:18:21] <hyper_ch> nope, that's perfect ;)
[13:18:58] <CrawfordComeaux> lol ok...well if there's a way to style it better, maybe. wouldn't it make more sense to display it somewhere else on the page?
[13:19:24] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: there's 9k entries in the db
[13:19:46] <CrawfordComeaux> ah nm...there are diff ways to implement a tooltip so it doesn't just disappear at the slightest movement
[13:20:06] <hyper_ch> besides the use of magic?
[13:22:06] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: http://jsfiddle.net/BV2XA/14/ - I was assuming the the link was supposed to open the modal. made a couple of comments in the HTML to show what I remember changing
[13:22:32] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  de link is opening the modal
[13:24:10] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  let me try it out.. thanks very much man
[13:24:51] <CrawfordComeaux> hyper_ch: yeah...by playing with the track & position options, mostly
[13:25:12] <CrawfordComeaux> Although I found this nice little tooltip lib the other day: http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/tipped
[13:25:59] <hyper_ch> CrawfordComeaux: :)
[13:26:25] <hyper_ch> I guess with the full screen tooltip the problem is that it loses focus when the tooltip layer appears
[13:27:34] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  is that suppose to work even if i bring it via ajax with the <a href="admins/add_users.php" onclick="cargar(this)
[13:28:50] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: unsure...give it a shot. Something tells me probably not though
[13:30:29] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: that seems odd, though. why is the php being called as post when you click the link?
[13:31:10] <CrawfordComeaux> wouldn't you want that done after validar()?
[13:33:19] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  not working with modal hide fade in
[13:35:20] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  when u use this type of modals u are suppose to have the form in the same page u have the link that triggers it out unless u use ajax right?
[13:36:47] <CrawfordComeaux> right
[13:36:55] <Kambfhase> is there a trick to create an documentFragment?
[13:37:41] <CrawfordComeaux> adavia: check out this - http://blog.assimov.net/blog/2012/03/09/ajax-content-in-twitter-bootstrap-modal/
[13:37:50] <CrawfordComeaux> Kambfhase: define "trick"
[13:38:51] <Kambfhase> well, right now I do $('<div>') append my elements and then .children().appendTo( dom)
[13:39:36] <Kambfhase> I thought, may be there was a nicer way, to do this-
[13:44:17] <cpierce_> the time function of the new jquery ui spinner widget requires the globalize thing?
[13:47:19] <adavia> CrawfordComeaux:  saved my life for today with that article
[13:47:20] <adavia> thankss
[15:22:03] <buu> Hey, is there any jquery methods to create dom elements other than the $("<html>") method?
[15:23:38] <brass> Do you not like that methodology?
[15:24:59] <buu> brass: It makes for some ugly code
[15:25:26] <buu> I'd prefer $.dom({type:"foo", name:"something",id:"somethingelse"})
[15:26:12] <jguffey> anyone here with experience with jQuery masonry, do you have any ideas on how to get the last row of a masonry to center horzontally?
[15:26:47] <brass> buu: It is similiar. $("<div>", { id: "id_name", name: "name" });
[15:27:12] <buu> brass: Oh, sweet.
[15:28:05] <buu> brass: Oh, er, how do I create the stuff inside the <div>? Like I just want <div id="foo">text</div>
[15:28:34] <buu> .html(text)?
[15:28:54] <brass> yea or { text: "content text here" }
[15:29:05] <brass> but yes appending .html('text'); at the end would work as well
[15:29:26] <brass> or .text('text');
[15:29:33] <buu> Oh, thanks.
[15:30:14] <brass> np
[15:31:20] <brass> buu: you will need to append it to the page if you want it visible. That just creates the element in the DOM.
[15:31:57] <buu> Yup, thanks.
[15:33:30] <codic> ciao
[15:33:36] <codic> !list
[15:33:42] <codic> list
[15:34:38] <brass> haha, looking for files i guess
[15:52:28] <weebs> ok im the first to admit i suck at the jquery. can anyone thow me a hint on what I am doing wrong to get a toggle to work with a nested table? http://pastebin.com/2xVqXjtL
[15:52:36] <weebs> oh and hello!
[15:53:56] <brass> sure
[15:54:12] <eph3meral> weebs: yep, your style is horrible, you should probably start there
[15:54:36] <eph3meral> weebs: once you've unfucked your style so your code is in fact actually understandable, then run it through http://validator.w3.org/ and JSLint (or similar) as well
[15:54:41] <eph3meral> weebs: THEN, come back and ask again
[15:54:45] <brass> ouch
[15:54:54] <eph3meral> the truth hurts
[15:55:05] <brass> weebs, are you trying to hide rows? I've only accomplished this by wrapping other elements around it
[15:55:12] <eph3meral> if someone else is masochistic enough to help him, i'll go get some popcorn :P
[15:55:23] <eph3meral> lol, that's a horrible idea also
[15:55:42] <Gemclip> ROFL
[15:55:43] <weebs> im trying to get the button to toggle vis on the first nested table.
[15:55:47] <eph3meral> brass: "I'll just wrap another div around this thing that doesn't work" <- one of the most common n00b mistakes ever
[15:56:01] <weebs> wow.. this place is harsh
[15:56:06] <sahbeewah> it really isn't that difficult to read
[15:56:24] <Gemclip> nah notice you didnt get help just a lot of grief
[15:56:25] <eph3meral> weebs: if by this place, you mean IRC, and or if by this place you mean me, right now, then yes
[15:56:33] <sahbeewah> you're calling siblings on the td, of which none of them have children with tables
[15:56:45] <sahbeewah> you need the siblings of the parent tr
[15:57:13] <brass> eph3meral, well it worked and passed standards. I'm sure your brilliant.
[15:57:25] <brass> which is why you get paid the big bucks
[15:57:37] <eph3meral> weebs: all I'm saying is the truth, basically, now I know it doesn't solve your problem, and someone else might be kind enough to try, but in the real world, I'm just letting you know that this is how many other devs will view your code
[15:57:51] <weebs> so ... parent().siblings().children('table:visible').toggle() ?
[15:57:52] <eph3meral> i wouldn't be doing you any favors by pretending that your code is well written
[15:57:58] <brass> eph3meral, you probably work from home and get to code all day in all different type of environments.
[15:58:30] <rgenito> does .post() not work in IE7 or something?
[15:58:35] <brass> eph3meral, i've also noticed you haven't actually given an answer which is why i seriously doubt you all together.
[15:58:45] <sahbeewah> but when you do parent().siblings() you'll have a TR element, of which their direct children can't possibly have a table
[15:58:50] <eph3meral> brass: works for me
[15:58:58] <eph3meral> brass: aka whatever floats your boat
[15:59:12] <brass> on irc i'm sure it does
[15:59:19] <eph3meral> rgenito: lol, you have to support IE7? I'm sorry.
[15:59:37] <brass> you should take that act on the road.
[15:59:38] <eph3meral> rgenito: I don't see why it shouldn't work, are you doing cross domain requests or something?
[16:00:15] <eph3meral> even IE6 has XHR iirc
[16:00:38] <weebs> sahbeewah are you saying I would not really be able to find the nested table?
[16:01:06] <eph3meral> weebs: usually I don't rely on element/child based selectors and rather on id's or unique class names
[16:01:24] <sahbeewah> u can find anything given there's some sort of structuer
[16:01:39] <brass> the easy way always
[16:01:42] <weebs> is there a way that i can get it to pop only the one closest to the button?
[16:01:46] <eph3meral> actually I tend to use unique class names whenever possible - which aids in the ability to not break the DOM if all of a sudden you find a need for two of some widget on a page
[16:02:33] <weebs> i gave the nested table the id of childtable but am unable to 'find' it
[16:02:35] <sahbeewah> specifically switching .children to .find would find it, but it might find more than you're looking for
[16:02:40] <sahbeewah> yeah what eph3meral said
[16:03:15] <eph3meral> weebs: $('#childtable').length will tell you
[16:03:24] <eph3meral> weebs: don't forget the # or . as the case may be
[16:03:30] <eph3meral> childtable is not a tag
[16:04:12] <eph3meral> weebs: do you know how to use the developer console?
[16:04:27] <eph3meral> weebs: that's a good place to start to try stuff out sandbox style before you write it down in actual code
[16:04:30] <weebs> which browser?
[16:04:34] <eph3meral> to be sure you're getting the results you expect
[16:04:38] <eph3meral> weebs: firefox and or chrome
[16:04:50] <eph3meral> i prefer chrome as it's dev console is just a wee bit better than firebug on average
[16:04:53] <brass> firebug weebs
[16:04:58] <eph3meral> and the default dev console in firefox is fairly lame IMO
[16:04:58] <weebs> i can't get any results out of chrome F12
[16:05:00] <brass> chrome's developer console is easy to read as well
[16:05:03] <eph3meral> chrome has better stack traces
[16:05:11] <eph3meral> weebs: define "get results"
[16:05:28] <weebs> F12 console .. no errors
[16:05:30] <eph3meral> this is why I asked if you "know how to use it", your answer indicates you don't, not really
[16:05:36] <eph3meral> weebs: aaaand, then what?
[16:05:36] <weebs> ok
[16:05:50] <weebs> click/ reload nothing
[16:05:51] <eph3meral> you can type arbitrary javascript in there and it'll run
[16:06:11] <rgenito> eph3meral, oooh, maybe it was a cross domain request and i didn't realize... or something
[16:06:12] <eph3meral> go to the "console" tab specificaly, make sure it's enabled, then you should have a little "prompt" consisting basically of a > symbol
[16:06:32] <brass> rgentio, http:// and https:// is cross domain as well you might check that.
[16:06:33] <eph3meral> rgenito: if it's cross domain you'll need to add like $.allowCrossDomain or something
[16:06:41] <rgenito> it's only considered cross domain if the subdomain is different, is it?
[16:06:42] <eph3meral> forget the exact name of the method call right now
[16:06:56] <eph3meral> rgenito: it's considered cross domain if ANYTHING in the domain is different iirc
[16:07:07] <rgenito> brass ah yes, that is right. now i'm wondering if maybe the issue was between having "www.website.com" and "website.com"
[16:07:13] <rgenito> ty for the info
[16:07:15] <eph3meral> rgenito: yes probably
[16:07:31] <eph3meral> rgenito: you should really have a redirect/rewrite setup in your webserver to only allow one or the other, www or not
[16:07:36] <eph3meral> it's called making your domain canonical
[16:07:54] <eph3meral> rgenito: redirect www to non or vice versa, that way regardless of what the user types in, they'll end up on the same site
[16:08:25] <eph3meral> of course, that requires server admin know-how and access which you may not have, but either way, if you don't have it, you'll need/want to tell your server admin that this is needed
[16:08:27] <brass> or you could simply do it in the .htaccess if you have a apache web daemon
[16:08:35] <eph3meral> and if they allow .htaccess files
[16:08:38] <eph3meral> which many sites do not
[16:08:42] <eph3meral> shared hosts anyway
[16:09:19] <brass> maybe godaddy shared hosts, but i've seen many accounts that allow it. It is quite common.
[16:10:27] <eph3meral> i've seen many that don't, it's quite common
[16:10:32] <eph3meral> esp amongst lower tier hosts
[16:11:10] <eph3meral> I am lucky enough to not have to deal with that anymore as Chef + Rackspace = no more need for crappy client dictated hosting
[16:11:23] <rgenito> heck, i just realized i dont entirely know what will happen if cross domain support isn't allowed...
[16:11:38] <rgenito> ...i'm guessing jquery will just forward to the page...perhaps @_@
[16:12:43] <brass> i don't have to deal with clients at all anymore, just one system.
[16:13:57] <eph3meral> rgenito: uhh, it'll just throw an error
[16:14:07] <eph3meral> normal users won't see it, but it should show up in console
[16:14:09] <rgenito> well i'll be damned
[16:14:15] <rgenito> ah ok
[16:14:19] <eph3meral> and to a user it will appear that "nothing happened"
[16:14:40] <rgenito> i have an ajax call to a site that returns {"success":true}
[16:15:03] <brass> json object
[16:15:07] <eph3meral> rgenito: www.google.com/search?q=jquery+allow+cross+domain+ajax
[16:15:08] <rgenito> however, during the ajax call, my boss gets a white page with {"success":true} at the top
[16:15:15] <rgenito> i got it once before too, but i'm not getting it.
[16:15:23] <rgenito> any idea what causes that?
[16:15:40] <eph3meral> rgenito: not without basically doing Your Job â„¢ for you, nope
[16:15:55] <eph3meral> rgenito: something in the code you wrote
[16:16:18] <brass> regento: you have to return the NVP variable value 'callback' with () braces around the object for cross domain
[16:16:24] <eph3meral> rgenito: I suggest thinking about adding a decent test suite such as possibly Jasmine and or Selenium
[16:17:41] <rgenito> brass: you mean in the json?
[16:17:47] <brass> yep
[16:18:07] <brass> not sure what server language your using
[16:18:08] <rgenito> as in, ({"NVP": "callback"})V?
[16:18:15] <rgenito> (minus the V)
[16:18:35] <brass> no like $_GET['callback'] . '(' . json_encode($array_or_object) . ')';
[16:18:52] <brass> which is php, but you get the idea
[16:20:26] <rgenito> ah yes, i got ya
[16:20:30] <brass> jquery sends a encrypted string with the ajax call when it is cross domain. That must be included in the object callback response.
[16:20:32] <rgenito> luckily i'm not calling a call back
[16:20:38] <brass> gotcha
[16:21:40] <rgenito> ah, but it looks like i WILL be if i'm doing a cross domain call...i'll see if i get there hehe
[16:21:48] <rgenito> thanks for mentioning that brass, i really appreciate it :)
[16:24:50] <brass> np, better to be direct this vague.
[16:25:30] <rgenito> ya :)
[16:38:07] <rick___> anyone uses twitter bootstrap here?
[16:43:02] <batmanbond3d> I do, it is great
[16:45:11] <rick___> batmanbond3d:  have u used modals?
[16:45:59] <sahbeewah> might be better just to ask your question
[16:46:47] <rick___> well im trying to bring up remote content to a modal like this http://jsfiddle.net/BV2XA/16/ but is not working
[16:46:50] <batmanbond3d> the modal popups?
[16:47:05] <rick___> yeah
[16:48:16] <batmanbond3d> works for me
[16:48:56] <brass> i've never used the bootstrap modal dialop window, but surely there is a way to make a asynchronus call to get remote content in its api.
[16:49:35] <rick___> well the method is using the remote property.. but i cant make it work
[16:51:01] <brass> rick are you using a javascript console to debug it?
[16:52:40] <rick___> yap
[16:52:56] <rick___> and nothing
[16:53:02] <weebs> So I cleaned up the code and am able to toggle the nested tables... but it either toggles the first or all... any idea how I can get it to only show/hide the relevant child table ? http://pastebin.com/GPzs027Z
[16:55:33] <sahbeewah> rick___: the first thing you're gonna need to do, is to not make up your own api and read the docs on how that is done
[16:56:06] <rick___> sahbeewah: im doing it on how its already done
[16:59:36] <weebs> sahbeewah any chance you can take a look at my paste? I am trying $(this).parent().siblings().children('.childTable').toggle() but no luck
[17:00:23] <noneelsewhere> anyone want to help me with the .done() callback? I can't seem to resolve it or make it work
[17:03:52] <sahbeewah> weebs: $(this).closest('tr').next().find('.childTable').toggle()
[17:04:12] <sahbeewah> weebs: i hold no responsibility for when you change the structure of the dom, breaking everything
[17:05:57] <weebs> are you better to just use $(#.toggler).click() ?
[17:06:11] <weebs> by the way thank you very much.
[17:06:20] <weebs> .toggler
[17:07:01] <weebs> this is totally going in evernote
[17:07:38] <sahbeewah> you're better to have some sort of link between your toggler, and the table that it wants to toggle, rather than relying on the structure of the dom to determine that
[17:08:47] <weebs> yeah but my issues is that it will be dynamically generated content.. meaing i would end up with id's like toggle1 and childtable1. and toggle2 and childtable2
[17:09:09] <weebs> is there a way i could easily handle that?
[17:11:20] <sahbeewah> yes you can
[17:11:36] <sahbeewah> hm
[17:12:04] <weebs> all samples I see are usually using static display
[17:12:30] <sahbeewah> so u have access to the back-end code?
[17:12:58] <weebs> yup
[17:13:13] <weebs> im just using repeater datat
[17:13:16] <weebs> data
[17:13:34] <batmanbond3d> anyone want to take a look at a SPA application I made
[17:14:04] <batmanbond3d> my company is suppose to make a couple million off it over the long term
[17:15:08] <sahbeewah> $('.toggler').click( function() { $('#childtable' + $(this).attr('id').substr(-1)).toggle() } );
[17:16:27] <weebs> huh... that is really cool sahbeeway
[17:16:32] <weebs> wah
[17:17:04] <sahbeewah> actually that's bad, need to regex for the number coz that'll break for more than 9 tables
[17:17:06] <sahbeewah> but you get the idea
[17:17:25] <weebs> so you would leave the toggler as a class and use the id of the table
[17:21:13] <sahbeewah> actually a more elegant solution would be to do this: put data-toggle="tableN" in your input button, put class="childTable tableN" on your table, then do $('.toggler').click(function() { $('table.' + $(this).data('toggle')).toggle(); } );
[17:21:39] <brass> batmanbond3d, a SAP system or SPA?
[17:22:09] <brass> sahbeewah, would that be a html5 attribute?
[17:22:36] <batmanbond3d> sorry my comp needed a restart
[17:23:56] <weebs> Sahbeewah I think i am gonna quit while I am ahead right now. brain is pretty tired.
[17:24:33] <sahbeewah> it is part of the html5 standard, but it'll work pretty much on every browser
[17:25:46] <batmanbond3d> so did anyone want to see
[17:25:47] <batmanbond3d> ?
[17:26:07] <jjb123> Hey everyone quick question. Is there a way, in Javascript, to check if a date in the format of "10-14-2012 04:58:03" is in the future or not? I tried just passing it to new Date() but I don't think it can parse it. Any ideas?
[17:27:14] <batmanbond3d> I ended up writing my own date parser to parse dates like that
[17:27:22] <batmanbond3d> don't know if it is the recommended approach
[17:32:00] <sahbeewah> preferably have them in isoformat to pass to the front-end
[17:32:05] <sahbeewah> if u can't, use http://www.datejs.com/
[17:33:16] <jjb123> That looks like it'll work good, thanks!
[17:42:50] <weebs> super nice solution sahbeewah. thanks for all your assists.
[17:47:17] <brass> batmanbond3d, sure

[17:57:22] <batmanbond3d> username: tsapi password Silanis1
[17:58:01] <batmanbond3d> hoping someone can give me feedback on some of my design choices
[17:58:38] <batmanbond3d> let me know if you are looking at it
[17:59:47] <brass> looking now
[18:00:17] <brass> bootstrap?
[18:00:23] <batmanbond3d> yup
[18:00:36] <batmanbond3d> a mix of bootstrap and jquery UI
[18:00:53] <batmanbond3d> found a nice project that merges them
[18:01:14] <ryanneufeld> looks snazzy batmanbond3d
[18:01:35] <batmanbond3d> I really like the bootstrap styling and the jquery ui widgets and utils
[18:01:41] <batmanbond3d> so I am happy someone merged them
[18:01:51] <brass> yea bootstraps css is sexy
[18:02:19] <batmanbond3d> the real invating stuff comes when you click configuration
[18:03:11] <batmanbond3d> in the top right corner
[18:03:32] <batmanbond3d> I allow users to configure their dashboard page in an intuitive way
[18:04:19] <brass> are the transactions billing transactions?
[18:04:40] <batmanbond3d> we do electronic signatures
[18:05:02] <brass> really, interesting.
[18:05:08] <brass> i'm about to being that as well
[18:05:26] <batmanbond3d> so companies build documents that can be signed online, it is legally binding, and then they use this tool I made to track the progress of their signatures
[18:06:20] <batmanbond3d> right now we only provide an api for users to create doucments to sign
[18:07:04] <batmanbond3d> but I am suppose to create another product that allows users to create their own signing ceremony
[18:07:06] <brass> where can i look at it?
[18:07:27] <brass> i might use your api
[18:08:03] <batmanbond3d> I can show a demo I made for the signing widget
[18:09:15] <rodyhaddad> Hey guys, just want to make sure: If I do $("#id").click(), is the event dispatched synchronously? (even if they are not set by jquery)
[18:09:45] <ryanneufeld> rodyhaddad: yes, the click is triggered as soon as the method is called
[18:10:18] <rodyhaddad> ryanneufeld, ok, and when jquery dispatched the event, does the browser execute it's listeners synchronously?
[18:10:45] <ryanneufeld> why wouldn't it be?
[18:11:27] <ryanneufeld> unless you're calling in the success handler of an ajax call
[18:11:36] <brass> batmanbond3d, yea if you would. I am interesting in it.
[18:11:45] <batmanbond3d> I think the only thing that is asynchronous are timing events and ajax calls
[18:11:58] <ryanneufeld> rodyhaddad: what batmanbond3d said
[18:12:15] <batmanbond3d> ok, hold on, let me boot it up
[18:12:38] <rodyhaddad> hmm…ok
[18:12:42] <rodyhaddad> thx guys :D
[18:13:09] <rodyhaddad> (anyway, if I get it an error from that, I'll report back :p)
[18:13:10] <ryanneufeld> rodyhaddad: are you experiencing something that is making you question this?
[18:16:41] <rodyhaddad> ryanneufeld, no (but I'm writing code that will "deal" with this), but in my head, it's a bit weird that the event gets triggered synchronously and not when js is "at rest". If your code is doing something, and the user clicks somewhere, the listener of the click won't (or rather shouldn't) get triggered before your other code finishes
[18:17:15] <ryanneufeld> OH
[18:17:20] <ryanneufeld> that's what you're asking
[18:17:39] <livingstn_> Does anyone have any recommendations for a good image slider (side-scrolling) that can display multiple thumbnails at once?
[18:17:42] <rodyhaddad> because maybe your code that is running is dependent on a state that the listener changed and two pieces of js code can't run at the same time in the same page
[18:18:04] <ryanneufeld> livingstn_: google buddy, there are litterally 1000s
[18:18:11] <livingstn_> ryanneufeld: That's the problem. :)
[18:18:30] <rodyhaddad> ryanneufeld, well that's what I had in my head with user-triggered events, but maybe it's different when you do a $el.click() in the code
[18:18:30] <livingstn_> I was hoping that I could thin the herd by getting a solid recommendation.
[18:19:03] <batmanbond3d> brass: Sorry, I can't get it started, there are no backends up to connect to
[18:19:35] <ryanneufeld> rodyhaddad: what it's important is that the handler attached to the listener is called (effectively) immediately when you click on the element. Calling .click() will only execute any handlers on that element that you've bound using jquery.
[18:20:28] <ryanneufeld> rodyhaddad: so an onclick attribute will not get called using jquery to trigger the click
[18:20:41] <rodyhaddad> ryanneufeld, ok, that's what I wanted to know :D
[18:20:56] <ryanneufeld> :)
[18:21:36] <rodyhaddad> ryanneufeld, do you know of a way to know when the listener not bound via jquery have finished executing? :P
[18:22:31] <ryanneufeld> no
[18:22:50] <ryanneufeld> unless they are changing a global variable you can watch, then I know of no way
[18:22:58] <ryanneufeld> ?pubsub @rodyhaddad
[18:22:59] <bot-t> rodyhaddad, jQuery publish/subscribe plugin by Peter Higgins http://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js
[18:24:08] <rodyhaddad> thx :D, looking into it
[18:25:34] <livingstn_> ryanneufeld: Do you have any particular ones that you've had a good experience with?
[18:33:35] <Splat> anyone able to advise me on how I can make it so when I click on a checkbox I send some the name of that checkbox to a php script ?
[18:34:27] <batmanbond3d> So is there anyone else who wants to take a look at my app that I made?

[20:21:43] <rsumi> i have a div with the height of 100px in css but the content expands to something more than 200px. the actual height is variable depending on data. i'm on purposely choosing to chop it off. i have a button that i would like to use with .animate() to expand it from 100px to it's actual height without knowing it. how do i do this?
[20:23:11] <rsumi> it seems to not animate when i use percentages
[21:00:50] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[21:01:58] <paul_irish> hey ProLoser|Work
[21:02:53] <ProLoser|Work> hey paul_irish

[21:04:25] <paul_irish> supposed to
[21:04:28] <paul_irish> but couldnt make it
[21:04:38] <ProLoser|Work> ah
[21:04:52] <paul_irish> what do windows folks use to write markdown?
[21:05:05] <paul_irish> anything cool?
[21:05:12] <ProLoser|Work> sublime is on winedoes
[21:05:21] <ProLoser|Work> or notepad++
[21:05:39] <ProLoser|Work> or were you looking for like some legit markdown app?
[21:06:14] <paul_irish> ya
[21:06:21] <paul_irish> something like Marked or Mou
[21:06:28] <paul_irish> or Byword
[21:07:49] <ProLoser|Work> umm
[21:08:08] <ProLoser|Work> http://alternativeto.net/software/mou/?platform=windows
[21:10:27] <ProLoser|Work> woa
[21:10:32] <ProLoser|Work> you guys finally rolled out the new site eh?
[21:10:42] <ProLoser|Work> erm, ui site i mean
[21:11:39] <ProLoser|Work> paul_irish: what's the ETA on the new plugin site? Last I remember it was close to release (?) at the jquery conf
[21:12:18] <ProLoser|Work> or did you guys just give up on that and are refocusing on yeoman? lol
[21:13:01] <paul_irish> there's nobody working on both projects
[21:13:03] <paul_irish> soooooooo
[21:13:13] <paul_irish> and i'm not active within jquery realmz anymore
[21:13:17] <paul_irish> :)
[21:13:43] <paul_irish> thx for the alternativeto hookup
[21:15:21] <_zoggy_> sup paul_irish
[21:21:16] <paul_irish> hi _zoggyzoggyzoggy_
[21:21:21] <_zoggy_> oi oi oi
[21:21:25] <paul_irish> :)
[21:22:36] <_zoggy_> any new drunken jquery video rants lately? :)
[21:23:25] <eph3meral> ProLoser|Work: gvim
[21:23:54] <_zoggy_> so far this MarkdownPad works decently
[21:24:26] <paul_irish> _zoggy_: no but great idea
[21:24:33] <paul_irish> actually wait
[21:24:49] <paul_irish> yeah we recorded a new yayquery
[21:25:07] <paul_irish> its finished
[21:25:09] <paul_irish> we just didnt ship it
[21:25:42] <_zoggy_> wish it could emulate github's markdown though
[21:26:35] <_zoggy_> oh yeah? was hoping there was going be a new video about jquery's 1.9.x and 2.x plans.. about where its going..
[21:26:58] <_zoggy_> and maybe touch on bootstrap being branched away from twitter.. since modo is now part of github
[21:28:51] <ProLoser|Work> eph3meral: what?
[21:29:14] <eph3meral> ProLoser|Work: I guess you'll have to be more specific on exactly what type of "markdown editor" you want
[21:29:21] <eph3meral> vim works well enough for me
[21:29:25] <ProLoser|Work> i don't want anything
[21:29:33] <eph3meral> oh crap
[21:29:37] <eph3meral> paul_irish: gvim
[21:36:06] <ProLoser|Work> has anyone ever had problems with performing a POST request on IE with json?
[21:36:12] <ProLoser|Work> like having to set the headers or some shit?
[21:37:16] <batmanbond3d> no but some version of IE don't have the library JSON
[21:37:24] <batmanbond3d> so you can't do JSON.stringify and JSON.parse
[21:37:36] <ProLoser|Work> i'm aware of that, i'm not referring to that
[21:38:04] <ProLoser|Work> i'm referring to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10822906/jquery-ajax-issue-on-ie9
[21:38:10] <ProLoser|Work> why is this necessary? does jquery compensate for this? etc
[22:12:51] <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/3887425 am I using ajax properly here?
[22:27:50] <quazimodo> woot fixed
[23:01:52] <Guest40601> how to wrap three divs into one
[23:03:46] <ProLoser|Work> I am trying to trigger a yui listener onchange
[23:03:58] <ProLoser|Work> for some reason elm.trigger('change') isn't working
[23:04:06] <ProLoser|Work> is there a way to trigger the global change event?
[23:04:49] <Cork> Guest40601: var div = $('<div/>') $(target).after(div); div.append(div1); div.append(div2); div.append(div3)
[23:05:46] <Cork> ProLoser|Work: that depends on how yui does its listening
[23:05:49] <buu> coderhut: Is there any difference between $('<div>') and $('<div/>') to jquery?
[23:05:57] <Cork> ProLoser|Work: and ya, prob not through trigger
[23:06:08] <Cork> buu: no
[23:06:14] <buu> well ok.
[23:06:50] <ProLoser|Work> Cork: so how then?
[23:06:56] <ProLoser|Work> trigger is jquery only?
[23:07:29] <Cork> ProLoser|Work: not completely sure, but i think it is
[23:07:48] <Cork> it mainly looks in jQuery.event
[23:07:54] <munichlinux> ProLoser|Work: well, this is not YUI channel. Anyway answer to your question is to use simulate, => http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/event/
[23:09:13] <munichlinux> ProLoser|Work: trigger is a jquery specific function. Trigger or simulate essentially calls the registered callback for that event.
[23:11:46] <ProLoser|Work> munichlinux: i need select2 to trigger a yui change
[23:12:15] <munichlinux> what is select2?
[23:12:20] <_zoggy_> so MarkdownPad doesnt have a find/replace feature
[23:12:27] <munichlinux> ProLoser|Work: what is select2?
[23:14:56] * munichlinux wonder what kind of a name is ProLoser?
[23:16:24] <ProLoser|Work> select2 > chosen by harvesthq
[23:45:55] <Guest40601> how to wrap three divs into one
[23:51:22] <Cork> Guest40601: i answered that 40 mins ago
[23:51:47] <Guest40601> @Cork: where
[23:51:52] <Guest40601> I dont see it
[23:52:01] <buu> This isn't twitter, he doesn't need an @
[23:52:11] <buu> 01:04 < Cork> Guest40601: var div = $('<div/>') $(target).after(div); div.append(div1); div.append(div2); div.append(div3)
[23:52:33] <Guest40601> my divs are generated on the fly
[23:53:34] <buu> so are those divs
[23:53:37] <buu> What a coincidence!
[23:53:39] <Guest40601> I am doing something like this $(".outer-container").wrap('<div class="wrapper"></div>').append($div1, $div2, $div3).appendTo("body");
[23:54:03] <Guest40601> not actually divs, two divs and one a tag
[23:56:14] <astropirate> we can turn it into twitter
