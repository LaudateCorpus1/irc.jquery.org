[06:54:20] <konrados> Morning :)
[06:55:39] <konrados> I have a table with a few rows and then a few columns. I want to hide second colum so I do: $('table tr td').eq(1).hide(); but it hides a td only in the first row, so how can I achieve this?
[07:02:58] <hirsty> anyone using pdf.js as a web pdf viewer?
[07:11:38] <konrados> nvm, nth-child to the rescue :)
[07:12:23] <noregret> how can I change an attribute's value in an html string? $(html_str).find('label').attr('for', 'foo'); didn't work, what am i missing?
[07:19:01] <hellyeah> Anyone around
[07:21:59] <konrados> noregret syntax seems to be fine, but what is this "html_str"
[07:22:20] <konrados> ?
[07:26:11] <noregret> konrados: a var with html
[07:26:28] <noregret> konrados: https://dpaste.de/U1m0 something like that
[07:28:23] <konrados> noregret I don't know how this paste is related to your question, do you know that this should be a selector like $('#someDiv').find... if there is a div with id = 'someDiv'
[07:29:17] <noregret> konrados: i'm trying to replace an attribute in the last_row[0] var.. how is this not related?
[07:29:49] <konrados> noregret sorry, didn't notice,  sec
[07:31:22] <konrados> ok, but I still don't know what this last_row[0] holds, can you post what is the result of console.log(last_row[0]);
[07:31:37] <konrados> noregret ^
[07:32:16] <noregret> konrados: it's already there
[07:32:27] <noregret> konrados: line 2 to 9
[07:33:00] <konrados> noregret I thought that you wanted to show you html structure. Well you simply can't do something like this.
[07:33:20] <noregret> how can it be done then?
[07:33:22] <konrados> sec
[07:35:05] <konrados> noregret, add an id to the div like <div class = 'form-group' id = 'someId'> and then $('#someId').find('label').attr('for', 'foo')
[07:35:59] <noregret> konrados: why? how is it different than what i have?
[07:36:50] <konrados> noregret, wait... what do you want to achieve? Do you already have this html structure or maybe you want to create it with jquery?
[07:37:31] <noregret> konrados: it's already there
[07:37:47] <noregret> konrados: i want to replace all attribs with 0 in them
[07:37:52] <noregret> i'm taking the 0 and incrementing it
[07:37:57] <noregret> then putting it there
[07:38:24] <noregret> 0 is not always 0... that's why it's in a var named last_row, it gets last row in a table, and increments taht counter
[07:38:27] <noregret> not sure if i'm clear
[07:39:22] <konrados> noregret your code would be fine if you wanted to CREATE this whole html, but if you have it already on a website then use my approach. And remember about putting it in a $( document ).ready() but you probably know that.
[07:40:23] <konrados> ^ or a $(function(){ your_code })
[07:40:51] <noregret> konrados: i can't add ids to anything, as this is generated using a framework, django
[07:40:58] <noregret> konrados: so i don't want to mess with that
[07:41:55] <konrados> noregret I'm sure you can, but nevermind. Is this the only div with "form-group" class on a page?
[07:44:03] <noregret> konrados: no
[07:44:14] <noregret> konrados: this is a single row in a <table>, the first row
[07:44:22] <noregret> konrados: im' only trying to add rows dynamically
[07:44:39] <noregret> konrados: which means changing the ids/names and other attribs, to match the counter
[07:45:56] <konrados> noregret,  I asked you if the elements were already there on the page (and you didn't want to create them), and you said yes, now you're saying that you want to add rows dynamically, so how it is?
[07:46:46] <konrados> noregret,  You meant that you already ADDED those elements, so that's why they're already there, right?
[07:46:58] <noregret> konrados: oops, you're right. im' using datatables, and the elements aren't on the page already. there is a single row that i'm basing the new rows on
[07:48:56] <konrados> noregret ok, show me how you make the last_row array OK?
[07:49:25] <noregret> konrados: that's currently the whole thing, https://dpaste.de/MZVG
[07:50:46] <hellyeah> Someone know datepicker?
[07:53:08] <konrados> noregret, jquery needs a *selector* like '#myDiv' or a html element. What you pass is *definitely* not one of those...
[07:53:42] <konrados> noregret, what does console.log(dt.row(':last')) return?
[07:54:48] <konrados> noregret, note that I remove the .data part
[07:54:58] <noregret> konrados: an object, https://datatables.net/reference/api/row%28%29
[08:01:25] <hirsty>  pdfjsLib is undefined with pdf.js >.> #deathToIE
[08:01:50] <konrados> noregret, drug_label_for = $(last_row[0]).find('label').prop('for'); works o_O?
[08:03:28] <hirsty> trying to use pdf.js as a pdf viewer and IE is printing half pages :/
[08:05:40] <konrados> noregret, I mean this is your code, I'm only asking if this works, that would be strange...
[08:08:08] <noregret> konrados: yes it does, why wouldnt it?
[08:08:31] <noregret> konrados: everything works except the part the changes teh attr, i think i'm missing something
[08:10:08] <konrados> noregret, then indeed last_row[0] IS a html element, sec...
[08:17:27] <konrados> sorry noregret, I really thought the issue is in the fact that you aren't passing a html element. Now I really have no idea why this isn't working :( Maybe someone else can help. But, just out of curiosity, what does console.log($(last_row[0]).find('label')) print out?
[08:19:57] <noregret> konrados: an object, "Object[label.sr-only.control-label]"
[08:26:46] <konrados> noregret, well then I really don't know why it isn't working, sorry :( But maybe someone else...
[08:27:43] <noregret> no worries
[08:31:48] <noregret> how can I change an attribute's value in an html string? $(html_str).find('label').attr('for', 'foo'); didn't work, what am i missing?
[08:32:15] <taplar> uh, it's doing it, but your throwing away the result
[08:32:28] <suexec> Using jquery with bootstrap. $("#myPleaseWait").delay(400,"show_queue").modal("show"); <- Why does that not delay before showing ?
[08:32:39] <taplar> var $something = $(html_string); $something.find().attr();
[08:33:06] <taplar> if your wanting to actually change the string you'd either need to do a regex replace or do the manipulation and then change it back to a string
[08:33:21] <taplar> suexec: delay works on animations
[08:33:25] <taplar> it's not a replacement for setTimeout
[08:34:09] <taplar> ex. $(something).hide('slow').delay(2000).show('fast')
[08:35:40] <noregret> taplar: so this https://dpaste.de/9nsv should have last_row[0] = ... on line 13?
[08:35:44] <suexec> taplar, timeout_id = window.setTimeout($("#myPleaseWait").modal("show"), 400); <- better ?
[08:36:10] <taplar> suexec: you have to give it a method, not an invocation, otherwise it will happen immediately
[08:36:10] <garethdaine> Hey folks
[08:36:15] <garethdaine> I have this code http://kopy.io/nlf2M
[08:36:25] <taplar> setTimeout(function(){ ... }, 400);
[08:36:28] <garethdaine> It’s being activated on an <i> element
[08:36:51] <garethdaine> but when you move the mouse within the element the faded in element flashes in and out
[08:36:54] <garethdaine> Any ideas?
[08:37:06] <suexec> taplar, cool. Got it working. Cheers buddy
[08:37:17] <taplar> noregret: one sec
[08:41:06] <taplar> noregret: https://jsfiddle.net/7p7mpjmz/ <-- if you want to do it without regex
[08:45:52] <taplar> garethdaine: https://jsfiddle.net/00mhhgh2/ <-- hmm?
[08:45:53] <noregret> taplar: i used the regex to increment a counter as yu can see, is there another way for that? as shown on lines 11 & 12
[08:46:15] <noregret> taplar: that is, extracting an int, incrementing it, then putting it back
[08:46:31] <taplar> look at String.prototype.replace
[08:46:38] <taplar> the second argument can take a function
[08:46:57] <taplar> which takes in the matched substring
[08:47:19] <taplar> so you could take it in, increment it, and return the new string and it will do
[08:47:25] <taplar> *the work for you
[08:48:41] <noregret> taplar: so that still used regexes, right ?
[08:48:46] <noregret> uses *
[08:50:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/897cbcxr/
[08:51:01] <garethdaine> taplar: Yeah, I can’t replicate it in JS fidlle either https://jsfiddle.net/fkykke0a/11/
[09:02:40] <garethdaine> Sorted it
[09:09:03] <noregret> can I use selector with or? like $('select or input') - semthing with the same idea
[09:09:14] <taplar> , is an or
[09:09:35] <taplar> 'select, input'
[09:09:39] <taplar> same as css
[09:11:18] <Uhkis> its and
[09:11:32] <taplar> oh right
[09:11:53] <taplar> no... that's or
[09:11:56] <taplar> and would be no space
[09:12:18] <taplar> it's not xor, ;)
[09:14:02] <Uhkis> well anyways both get selected :D
[09:14:33] <taplar> ya
[09:15:39] <taplar> hmm, what would xor be in css... a:not(b), b:not(a) ?
[09:16:35] <Cork> there is no xor in css
[09:17:18] <Uhkis> xor was what noregret was looking for?
[09:17:26] <taplar> dunno
[09:17:29] <taplar> didn't think so
[09:17:32] <noregret> , is just fine
[09:17:33] <noregret> :)
[09:17:36] <taplar> just me thinking aloud
[09:19:04] <Uhkis> oh hi Cork, long time no see
[09:19:22] <Cork> ya, been a weird first 4 months
[09:19:40] <Cork> starting to cool down a little though
[09:19:48] <taplar> that's good
[09:20:03] <Cork> ya, starting to hit the limit of what i can take now
[09:20:12] <Uhkis> been really busy here too
[09:20:28] <Uhkis> good thing taplar has stepped up! :D
[09:20:47] <taplar> bah, he's incompitent
[09:20:54] <taplar> can't even spell either
[09:21:22] <Uhkis> yeah, you should see how he constantly fails "your" and "you're" :-)
[09:21:33] <taplar> lmao
[09:21:44] <taplar> you may be confusing failure with lazyness, ;)
[09:22:06] <Uhkis> or laziness!
[09:22:07] <Uhkis> ;D
[09:22:08] <taplar> but i see you're point
[09:22:24] <Uhkis> no i'm not!
[09:22:29] <taplar> lol

[09:28:30] <taplar> well, the whole finding the right place for the right price
[09:28:56] <taplar> or decent place for a good price that just needs a little work.

[12:12:59] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery. I have a problem with $.ajax in IE 9 doing a cross-origin PUT request to my web-service.  It fails with error statusText: "No transport". I don't have this problem in IE 10+.
[12:13:03] <al-damiri> How can I fix this?
[12:14:58] <al-damiri> I'm using jQuery version 1.11.3.
[12:17:55] <shoky> al-damiri: you need an xdr transport, available here  https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[12:18:47] <al-damiri> shoky: How do I use this?
[12:19:35] <shoky> al-damiri: you include that file after jquery and before your code
[12:20:08] <rashkov> jak2000: http://jsfiddle.net/9rgch963/
[12:21:45] <al-damiri> shoky: I see, thanks. Another question, I'm using deferreds/promises in my code with $.ajax(), do I have to change anything if I include this hook/file?
[12:21:51] <jak2000> rashkov? not work :(
[12:22:09] <al-damiri> Also what does this do and why is the problem occurring? Is it a fix only for IE9?
[12:22:21] <al-damiri> And on other browsers this code won't be executed?
[12:23:54] <shoky> al-damiri: i don't think you need to change anything. and yes it's for IE9 and maybe 8 or 7 too, don't remember.  they don't support CORS but they support this xdr thing
[12:23:56] <awkwardCough> jak2000: http://jsfiddle.net/9rgch963/1/
[12:24:20] <al-damiri> shoky: Okay, that sounds great. Thanks.
[12:24:52] <rashkov> jak2000: here's mine: http://jsfiddle.net/9rgch963/2/
[12:26:12] <al-damiri> Another question, on jQuery's website browser support page, it says that jQuery 1.x supports browsers IE6+, and I'm using jQuery 1.11.3, why does it not work then? Shouldn't jQuery have this fixed?
[12:26:14] <jak2000> ok, checking friends thanks
[12:27:39] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 sorry, was in a quick meeting - your original code doesn't make sense for what you want to do.
[12:27:51] <jak2000> yes
[12:28:35] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the markup at all?
[12:29:05] <rashkov> al-damiri: https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283#comment:43
[12:29:19] <jak2000> al-damiri based on your code i added the final sum... http://jsfiddle.net/9rgch963/4/   but the sum is 0 why?
[12:29:43] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 are you allowed to modify the markup at all?
[12:30:15] <shoky> al-damiri: it supports it via a plugin, all good :)
[12:31:43] <jak2000> robertmaxrees escuse me not understand
[12:31:47] <shoky> al-damiri: xdr might not support a PUT request btw, i see now
[12:31:47] <jak2000> explain pls more
[12:31:52] <robertmaxrees> can you add classes to the html?
[12:31:56] <al-damiri> shoky: Yes I was about to write that : )
[12:32:04] <al-damiri> What alternatives do I have then?
[12:32:29] <shoky> al-damiri: use GET/POST, use server-side proxy, drop IE9   :)
[12:32:33] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8Ltaou9j/7/ this is much cleaner.
[12:32:52] <shoky> al-damiri: or hacks like JSONP
[12:33:03] <shoky> al-damiri: if the server supports it
[12:33:07] <al-damiri> shoky: That sucks :)
[12:33:16] <shoky> al-damiri: IE9 sucks, that's a given :)
[12:33:16] <al-damiri> wouldn't this be resolved if I used jQuery 2.x?
[12:33:23] <al-damiri> Agreed, no doub.t
[12:33:26] <robertmaxrees> al-damiri no.
[12:33:31] <robertmaxrees> 2.x doesn't support old IE.
[12:33:39] <robertmaxrees> 2.x and 1.x share the exact same features.
[12:33:40] <al-damiri> robertmaxrees: But it supports IE9.
[12:33:56] <shoky> it doesn't add features to IE9 that IE9 doesn't have
[12:34:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:34:09] <al-damiri> Understood.
[12:34:10] <jak2000> robertmaxrees ok, checking and the operation (multiplication) is  only when lost focus?
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's what you original code had.  feel free to use a different event.
[12:34:40] <jak2000> type please 4  in price and press TAB only make the multiplication
[12:34:46] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[12:34:52] <jak2000> ok...
[12:34:55] <robertmaxrees> that's what the change event does, which is what your original code was using.
[12:34:59] <robertmaxrees> youc an change that event if you'd like.
[12:35:09] <jak2000> ok
[12:35:13] <jak2000> changing
[12:35:19] <robertmaxrees> you could use input
[12:36:04] <al-damiri> Thanks folks.
[12:39:20] <rashkov> jak2000: have a look at mine when you get a chance: http://jsfiddle.net/9rgch963/2/
[12:40:06] <robertmaxrees> rashkov that does almost exactly what mine does but doesn't store $(this).closest('tr') in a var :)
[12:40:21] <al-damiri> Any ideas/resources with which I can nicely explain & convince my team to drop support for older versions of IE?
[12:40:29] <rashkov> robertmaxrees: great minds think alike ;)'
[12:40:32] <robertmaxrees> al-damiri do you make money from it?
[12:41:02] <al-damiri> robertmaxrees: That I'll have to find out how many customers are using those older versions of IE.
[12:41:29] <robertmaxrees> al-damiri you should know that already.
[12:41:40] <robertmaxrees> like, your analytics should tell you that.
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> support old IE if it makes you enoughg money.  drop it if it doesn't.
[12:41:58] <al-damiri> Unfortunately, I don't. Was dragged into this project all of a sudden.
[12:42:04] <al-damiri> robertmaxrees: Fair enough.
[12:42:18] <al-damiri> But I'll be able to find out.
[12:42:23] <robertmaxrees> :) my company supports back to IE8.  plenty of tools and things out there to make it not that hard.
[12:42:39] <al-damiri> robertmaxrees: What are those tools and things?
[12:43:08] <robertmaxrees> graceful degredation, knowing small caveats, and things like bless.js when needed.
[12:44:36] <al-damiri> I see.
[12:59:12] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/8Ltaou9j/12/ why not perform the sum?
[12:59:31] <robertmaxrees> ....
[12:59:36] <robertmaxrees> $("table").on('change', 'input', function () {
[12:59:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do tht.
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> wait sorry hahahaha
[12:59:54] <robertmaxrees> my bad. one sec.
[13:02:41] <robertmaxrees> easy: you're trying to add empty values.
[13:02:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8Ltaou9j/14/
[13:04:19] <jak2000> ahh ok, thanks modified mine: http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/15/
[13:04:56] <jak2000> why keyup is different to change?
[13:29:53] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/19/
[13:29:55] * taplar is bored
[13:31:26] <jak2000> taplar Thanks!!
[13:31:56] <taplar> though in retrospect with the price and quantity being delegate bound, probably not the best idea to cache the rows ahead of time
[13:32:40] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/20/
[13:32:49] <jak2000> taplar in your fiddle if user type a "w" how to prevent this?
[13:32:57] <jak2000> or a non numerical value
[13:33:22] <taplar> you could do a binding to cancel it if it happens
[13:35:51] <jak2000> taplar escuse me can you show? please
[13:37:31] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/21/
[13:38:30] <jak2000> ok so  so i understand...
[13:38:31] <jak2000> reading
[13:40:45] <taplar> heh, small bug, you can't clear it out after it's got a value
[13:41:14] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/22/
[13:47:00] <taplar> awkwardCough broke it by typing really fast so... http://jsfiddle.net/8Ltaou9j/23/
[13:47:10] <taplar> he really wants to be a QA
[13:47:28] <awkwardCough> lies and slander
[13:53:36] <duch_kazatel> i'd put that into the original event binding hth
[13:54:13] <taplar> true
[13:54:21] <taplar> catch at the end instead of each time
[14:09:54] <jak2013> taplar thanks
[14:10:18] <taplar> woah, you advanced 13 years
[14:11:56] <jak2013> yes :)
[14:12:17] <taplar> it's like quantum leap up in this bizzy
[14:14:43] <jak2013> taplar you know about css?
[14:15:09] <taplar> little bit
[14:18:51] <jak2013> in a pm please
[14:19:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:19:08] <taplar> hmm?
[14:36:03] <jak2013> taplar http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9rgch963/14/   in this fiddle i have a input hidden in the jquery operation the index,
[14:36:06] <jak2013> count?
[14:36:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:36:42] <taplar> yes your selector, '.input', will find it
[14:36:48] <taplar> but it's hidden so you can't keyup on it
[14:37:22] <taplar> but any where your doing just '.input' will find it
[14:37:37] <jak2013> i changed the index... and not do the operation
[14:37:41] <jak2013> multiplication
[14:37:57] <taplar> you really should change it to use classes instead of positions
[14:38:09] <taplar> position based logic is inheriently fragile
[14:38:23] <taplar> like my ability to spell
[14:38:23] <robertmaxrees> like we've shown you.
[14:38:26] <jak2013> ok done
[14:38:27] <robertmaxrees> repeatedly.
[14:38:30] <jak2013> solved...
[14:38:33] <jak2013> robertmaxrees!
[14:38:33] <robertmaxrees> i solved this problem for you already :)
[14:38:41] <jak2013> robertmaxrees yes i know
[14:39:02] <jak2013> only added an hidden field, no problem with the operation only know if a hidden field count on the index
[14:39:03] <jak2013> thanks
[14:39:06] <jak2013> undersstand
[14:39:32] <strayArch> is it possible to know which event was triggered under .on() if there is more than one?
[14:39:49] <taplar> e.event or e.type or something
[14:40:00] <taplar> console.log(e) and take a look at it
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.type/
[14:40:36] <taplar> though if you have to query which one it was, you might want to break up the binding
[14:40:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:41:15] <strayArch> $(scanvas.group).on('mouseenter mouseleave', colorSync.bind(this,scanvas));    is the my mess :3
[14:41:58] <strayArch> I suppose I could break it up. Was trying to be elegant :D
[14:42:00] <robertmaxrees> strayArch sounds like you want an enter and a leave handler.
[14:42:01] <taplar> uh, are you just changing the color on hover?
[14:42:11] <robertmaxrees> nah, being explicit is more elegant.
[14:42:11] <taplar> cause css can do that all on it's own
[14:42:39] <strayArch> taplar, http://stro.nz/#portfolio
[14:42:41] <jak2013> friends is possible, 'control' the ENTER key? (when user press, ENTER key) move to next input?
[14:42:50] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[14:42:55] <strayArch> taplar, I'm rewriting it
[14:43:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2013 sounds like you have  alot of really basic questions.,
[14:43:04] <taplar> yeah, you can do that with just css
[14:43:31] <taplar> .elementClass { color: white; } .elementClass:hover { color: blue; }
[14:44:10] <strayArch> oh,
[14:44:11] <jak2013> robertmaxrees yes i know
[14:44:23] <jak2013> robertmaxrees have any link for read about?
[14:44:33] <robertmaxrees> jak2013 learn.jquery.com
[14:44:37] <jak2013> :)
[14:44:43] <jak2013> but about enter key event
[14:44:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:44:55] <robertmaxrees> read the learning center docs.
[14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> specifically the section on events.
[14:47:04] <strayArch> taplar, wait, but how do I change the color of the canvas
[14:47:28] <taplar> ok, basic html you can do just with css.  not sure with canvas, :)
[14:48:06] <strayArch> :P that's what the goal was, because when you hover canvas, you are not hovering the html
[14:56:27] <geri> hi decx
[15:15:05] <VectorX> im passing html as an ajax result, whats the best way to make the data as small as possible, i was thinking base64 but that seems to be making it larger
[15:17:08] <robertmaxrees> why not use JSON instead?
[15:17:14] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just strip whitespace.
[15:21:04] <NoiseEee> why does size matter
[15:22:02] <VectorX> robertmaxrees im stripping the whitespace but wanted to see if there was something else i could do, json wasnt used to cut dev time
[15:22:15] <duch_kazatel> why is size so important?
[15:22:25] <duch_kazatel> are you noticing transfers are taking forever?
[15:22:32] <VectorX> no
[15:22:45] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't worry about it then.
[15:23:17] <VectorX> ok
[15:23:29] <robertmaxrees> premature optimization is the devil.
[15:28:37] <jak2000> robertmaxrees :)
[15:32:43] <Side_FX> Does jquery function treat global variables the same as in regular js?
[15:33:48] <Side_FX> I have var whatever; whatever = 'something'; then in a jquery function alert(whatever); responds with undefined
[15:34:24] <taplar> you'd have to show an example of what your doing
[15:34:33] <taplar> it should act the same
[15:34:41] <Side_FX> let me pastebin
[15:35:50] <Side_FX> http://pastebin.com/b7vE9hj1
[15:36:22] <taplar> which part is giving you undefined?
[15:36:26] <Side_FX> the 10's in there are for testing purpose showing me the php is working, the alert at the begining responds with undefined
[15:36:45] <Side_FX> all of the rating0.. vars are undefined.
[15:37:17] <taplar> where is this logic located?  i see that part is not in a doc ready
[15:37:49] <Side_FX> It should all be there, the rating variables are defined in the first part
[15:38:09] <Side_FX> the other ratings besides 02 are identical filling out their own variable
[15:39:00] <taplar> at the beginning of 'ratingFunc02', what do you see if you console.log(this.outerHTML) ?
[15:39:38] <Side_FX> outer or inner?
[15:39:44] <taplar> outer
[15:39:47] <Side_FX> let me check
[15:40:46] <Side_FX> <div style="background-color: rgb(217, 217, 217);" class="ratingbox rating02">8</div><div style="background-color: rgb(217, 217, 217);" class="ratingbox rating02">8</div>
[15:41:29] <Side_FX> That pasted twice for some reason
[15:41:29] <taplar> that exactly or did you double paste?
[15:41:33] <taplar> :)
[15:42:18] <taplar> ok, so i just noticed your external variable is missing an 's'
[15:42:35] <taplar> if your trying to match those up
[15:42:41] <Side_FX> Jesus that's it.
[15:42:47] <Side_FX> Thanks.
[15:43:06] <Side_FX> ty
[15:43:16] <taplar> that did it?
[15:43:54] <Side_FX> Checking now, I'm sure that's the problem though.
[15:44:12] <Side_FX> It's wrong in the alert too so I was assuming it was passing the right info, but this explains it
[15:44:49] <taplar> well 12 and 13 matched so that should have been fine, which is why i'm a little confused if that did not work before
[15:45:57] <Side_FX> Do you ever get experienced enough in programming that these things don't happen?
[15:46:33] <taplar> eh, it's all about repetition
[15:46:47] <Side_FX> Yep that was it.
[15:47:52] <taplar> i don't know how big of an issue it would be for you, but you might try putting 'use strict'; in your js file.  it can help you catch some potential issues
[15:48:38] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
[15:49:02] <Side_FX> Yeah that would have caught this.

[17:47:20] <jak2000> thanks
[17:47:32] <jak2000> robertmaxrees its ok this link for learn about enter key?
[17:47:38] <jak2000> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21240316/focus-on-next-input-field-inside-table-with-enter-key-press
[17:47:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you'd make the enter key do that in the first place.
[18:00:29] <jak2000> robertmaxrees some users in win32 apps, do that....
[18:00:37] <robertmaxrees> right, in native apps.
[18:00:40] <jak2000> i want move with enter key to net control
[18:00:42] <robertmaxrees> this is a webapp. different concept.
[18:06:41] <jak2000> robertmaxrees i am understand you say.....
[18:06:53] <jak2000> but some ppl not... and hit ENTER and submit the form :)
[18:07:00] <jak2000> how to fix this?
[18:07:35] <robertmaxrees> prevent default on the submit.
[18:24:13] <jak2000> same as: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6462143/prevent-default-on-form-submit-jquery
[18:37:13] <jak2000> how to hidde a column on a table

[18:46:14] <jak2000> cannap but how to specify the table name?
[18:51:49] <cannap> what
[18:52:03] <cannap> $('selector');
[18:52:06] <cannap> $('selector').
[19:00:26] <jak2000> $('td:nth-child(1)').hide();
[19:00:41] <jak2000> BUT HOW TO SPECIFY THE TABLE NAME
[19:00:45] <jak2000> sorry for the caps
[19:00:54] <systemfault> Time to learn CSS :/
[19:00:59] <systemfault> Seriously.
[19:02:05] <systemfault> https://jsfiddle.net/m6fp7d5u/
[19:02:07] <jak2000> systemfault for me?
[19:02:10] <systemfault> Sure.
[19:02:39] <systemfault> It's kind of pointless to learn JS or jQuery or anything related to the DOM is you don't understand CSS
[19:08:46] <cannap> @jak2000 http://flukeout.github.io/
[19:16:25] <jak2000> systemfault thanks
[19:16:25] <jak2000> done
[19:16:31] <systemfault> :)
[19:17:09] <jak2000> now
[19:17:15] <jak2000> how to delete a row on a table?
[19:17:44] <systemfault> Select the appropriate <tr> and remove it
[19:18:55] <jak2000> here my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/no87h5bj/
[19:19:57] <jak2000> better: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/no87h5bj/2/
[19:20:01] <systemfault> jak2000: Add a click handler on the button the inside it, you would do something like $(this).closest('tr').remove();
[19:20:45] <jak2000> see: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/no87h5bj/3/
[19:21:00] <systemfault> You really need to learn some CSS...
[19:21:10] <jak2000> :)
[19:21:31] <systemfault> jak2000: How do you select an element having a "CLASS" of "butnBorrar"?
[19:21:35] <systemfault> In CSS
[19:22:01] <jak2000> right
[19:22:29] <cannap> left
[19:28:53] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/no87h5bj/4/
[19:28:56] <jak2000> not work :(
[19:29:24] <systemfault> Works damn well
[19:31:00] <jak2000> click the button and not deleted... the row
[19:31:10] <cannap> nah it gives NaN
[19:32:04] <cannap> this.price = $(this).val(); this you need to change
[19:32:50] <cannap> no
[19:34:51] <jak2000> cannap no problem with the operations
[19:35:00] <jak2000> if fill the 3 input an d try delete a row cant
[19:35:48] <cannap> i can
[19:36:10] <jak2000> can delete a row?
[19:36:30] <cannap> i filled all inputs
[19:36:31] <NDeb> How can I manipulate the dom of a html string?
[19:36:32] <cannap> then i delete
[19:37:31] <cannap> replace?
[19:37:44] <cannap> @Ndeb
[19:37:56] <jak2000> yes same as me
[19:38:10] <jak2000> but not delete a row
[19:39:58] <NDeb> cannap: I want to act upon an HTML string using jQuery, deleting and changing elements
[19:40:10] <systemfault> NDeb: You can't.
[19:40:23] <systemfault> NDeb: Because jQuery deals with a DOM, not a string
[19:40:37] <NDeb> systemfault: well how do I make a dom out of a string?
[19:40:50] <systemfault> NDeb: So, you could create a DOM fragment using jQuery by doing var fragment = $(theHtml);
[19:41:10] <systemfault> NDeb: Then you can operate on it using the jquery functions.
[19:41:23] <NDeb> systemfault: I tried that, but it didn't seem to work
[19:41:30] <systemfault> NDeb: What happens?
[19:41:50] <systemfault> In some cases, you might need to do: var fragment = $($.parseHTML(theHtml));
[19:42:25] <NDeb> systemfault: I first did it and tried to remove an element and the element stayed. Now I am getting an error when trying to create the fragment. I am working on it now though.
[19:43:03] <cannap> can you show code
[19:43:06] <cannap> or a example
[19:43:51] <NDeb> cannap: will do
[19:44:53] <jak2000> cannap systemfault any advice? pls
[19:45:03] <systemfault> jak2000: Rows are deleted.
[19:45:11] <systemfault> Your code works
[19:46:13] <jak2000> done!!!!
[19:46:59] <cannap> so now show
[19:47:50] <jak2000> what is the difference into: $(document).on('keyup', '.total, .flete', function () {    and $('.flete').on('keyup', function () {   thanks
[19:48:23] <systemfault> The first one uses event delegation, the second uses normal event handling.
[19:49:01] <cannap> is the second faster?
[19:49:05] <jak2000> i use the first, when i call an ajax, and create a html table and or inputs and or buttons,
[19:49:14] <jak2000> i use the second when the html code exists...
[19:49:18] <jak2000> systemfault i am ok?
[19:50:30] <systemfault> Yes, that's a simple but okay way to understand it.
[19:50:54] <NDeb> cannap: made a pen
[19:50:57] <NDeb> http://codepen.io/NoahGregory/pen/xVjVEg
[19:51:04] <systemfault> You need the first one if you want your event handler to work on elements that are going to be added in the future
[19:51:21] <NDeb> If you check the console the h3 I tried to remove is clearly still part of the fragment
[19:51:30] <cannap> wow
[19:52:13] <NDeb> cannap: wow what?
[19:52:23] <cannap> i got some console log
[19:52:27] <cannap> but what now
[19:52:28] <cannap> :D
[19:53:04] <NDeb> fragment.filter('h3').remove() should have removed the h3 correct?
[19:53:33] <cannap> no
[19:53:43] <NDeb> cannap: why not?
[19:53:48] <jak2000> systemfault ok, have a link for read more about it?
[19:54:24] <systemfault> Look for "event delegation", it works because of something called "event bubbling"
[19:56:02] <NDeb> cannap: what did I do wrong?
[19:58:53] <cannap> have you a version
[19:59:02] <cannap> where you dont escape all the tags
[19:59:50] <cannap> it always a string for jquery then
[20:00:22] <systemfault> NDeb: Try console.log(fragment.filter(':not(h3)').text());
[20:00:46] <systemfault> NDeb: filter doesn't modify the current collection, it creates a new one.
[20:04:14] <NDeb> systemfault: cool, that helps a bit, except I would like to remove the h3 and then add a space after "1-2" in the sup tag
[20:04:34] <cannap> yea the problem is you escape this shit
[20:04:43] <cannap> with  \=bla
[20:04:56] <cannap> its a string like a normal text
[20:05:29] <cannap> remove  \
[20:05:42] <cannap> and put ' ' to w
[20:05:51] <cannap> no what fuck i talk about php
[20:08:38] <cannap> http://codepen.io/cannap/pen/xVjVqq
[20:09:07] <cannap> xD
[20:11:51] <cannap> you dont put a real "html" tag in this
[20:11:59] <cannap> you escape the tags
[20:12:28] <cannap> with     \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
[20:12:38] <NDeb> I get error "invalid left hand assignment"
[20:12:53] <cannap> yea ignore this one
[20:13:28] <cannap> remove all masking escpaing tags
[20:13:38] <cannap> \\\\
[20:13:52] <NDeb> well, it does not appear to work with that error there. my console is black
[20:13:56] <NDeb> blank
[20:16:33] <NDeb> nevermind, I found a different way
[20:35:16] <guest____> Yo anyone here?

[22:56:14] <Forbidd3_> Hey everyone. I have one large image that shows different things on it, like a comic strip. I want to put this in a div, responsively, have arrows that scroll it right and left. What would I look for to find this concept? When I look I find just sliders with slides.
