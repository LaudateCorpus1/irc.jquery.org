[00:29:12] <boltR> what is the progressbar thing at the top of youtube called?
[00:29:29] <boltR> is there a definitive jquery library people are using for it?
[00:29:53] <Cork> most likely it's page specific
[00:30:16] <Cork> and it isn't like it is that special
[00:34:22] <boltR> nvm found a plugin
[00:34:29] <boltR> Cork: you don't think pjax is special?
[00:35:05] <Cork> boltR: no really no
[00:35:09] <Cork> *not
[00:35:33] <Cork> pushState isn't anything new anymore
[00:35:58] <Cork> lots of sites use it, and lots of libs helps handling it
[00:37:58] <Snoopal> hey guys i was wondering how i get the foo out of <option value="bar">foo</option> of all options of a specific select?
[00:38:14] <Snoopal> to get bar is easy -> $(this).val(); but how to get foo?
[00:38:40] <Cork> so you want it for all options or the currently selected one?
[00:38:57] <Cork> cause ya val() gives you the current value
[00:39:06] <Cork> (if this is the select element that is)
[00:40:09] <Snoopal> i would do a "each" functino
[00:40:22] <Snoopal> but i want also the "name" of the option
[00:40:37] <Cork> you didn't answer the question
[00:40:43] <Snoopal> all options
[00:40:44] <Cork> what is "this" in your question?
[00:41:07] <Snoopal> this <-- element within a .each function
[00:41:19] <Cork> so... it's the select element?
[00:41:33] <Cork> or an individual option element?
[00:41:45] <boltR> Snoopal: try text()
[00:41:54] <Snoopal> boltR:  thank you :)
[02:12:23] <Monkey_b> hey guys, does anyone know if its possible for a 'remove()' function to trigger the parent elements 'hover' function?
[02:12:28] <Monkey_b> cause that seems to be whats happening
[02:14:09] <Cork> uh
[02:14:19] <Cork> no remove() doesn't trigger any events
[02:15:10] <Cork> if the mouse is over the element as it is removed "hover" will be triggered on the next element in the stack though
[02:15:22] <Cork> but that is cause the mouse is now over the other element
[02:15:49] <Cork> (hover doesn't really exist as an event, it is mousemove and mouseout)
[02:19:04] <Monkey_b> ok
[02:19:08] <Monkey_b> it seems like thats whats happening
[02:19:12] <Monkey_b> but
[02:19:19] <Monkey_b> why the hell does the toggle behavior change
[02:20:00] <Monkey_b> in other words, divA has a .hover attached... with a child divB... when i $('#divB').remove()... the divA hover behavior behaves in opposite fashion... and all of a sudden what was previously the mouseover now acts as the mouseout
[02:20:05] <Monkey_b> and vice versa
[02:21:16] <xKraty> Monkey_b: how you remove divB ?
[02:24:16] <Monkey_b> xKraty: <div id="divB"><a id="rmvbtn">remove divB</a></div>
[02:24:50] <Monkey_b> $('#rmvbtn').click(function() { $('#divB').remove(); });
[02:24:52] <Monkey_b> thats the gist of it
[02:24:55] <xKraty> Monkey_b: so when you remove it the divA may loose the focus
[02:25:06] <xKraty> eventhought the mouse it still there
[02:25:13] <Monkey_b> right, i think thats whats happening
[02:25:17] <Monkey_b> oh
[02:25:19] <Monkey_b> that makes sense
[02:25:28] <xKraty> you could readd the hover class
[02:25:33] <Monkey_b> that makes perfect since
[02:25:53] <Monkey_b> well not perfect sense
[02:26:11] <Cork> Monkey_b: could you make a small demo in jsfiddle or jsbin?
[02:26:15] <Monkey_b> because for example, there is an input  field in divA that when i focus on, doesnt interfere with divA's hover in any way
[02:26:25] <Monkey_b> Cork: i'll try, one sec
[02:27:21] <xKraty> $('#rmvbtn').click(function() { $('#divB').remove().then(function() { $('#divA').addClass('hover'); });  });
[02:27:50] <Cork> xKraty: you don't need then there
[02:28:02] <Cork> remove isn't async
[02:29:03] <xKraty> Cork: just for be sure it's executed when it's done
[02:29:28] <Cork> xKraty: it adds quite a bit of extra complexity to the call
[02:29:46] <Cork> and it makes no difference what so ever to the effect
[02:30:21] <xKraty> Cork: i'm just used to be sure :D
[02:30:35] <xKraty> but you are right
[02:37:10] <Monkey_b> still working on the jsfiddle
[02:37:14] <Monkey_b> this bare bones example is working
[02:37:17] <Monkey_b> http://jsfiddle.net/YJd8Y/
[02:37:28] <Monkey_b> going to see if i can reproduce my exact scenario
[02:44:08] <Trisox> Monkey_b http://jsfiddle.net/YJd8Y/1/
[02:44:30] <Trisox> ?.css()
[02:44:34] <Monkey_b> ok guys
[02:44:35] <Monkey_b> i got it
[02:44:40] <Monkey_b> http://jsfiddle.net/YJd8Y/
[02:44:42] <Trisox> check the syntax
[02:44:42] <Monkey_b> take a look
[02:44:55] <Trisox> that aint gona work
[02:45:01] <Monkey_b> with toggleclass it busts
[02:45:03] <Monkey_b> with addcss its fine
[02:45:11] <Trisox> .css{ background-color: red; } doesnt work
[02:45:17] <Monkey_b> yea i fixed it
[02:45:17] <Monkey_b> reload
[02:45:25] <Monkey_b> wait
[02:45:25] <Monkey_b> wait
[02:45:27] <Monkey_b> its not saving
[02:45:27] <Monkey_b> lol
[02:45:30] <Monkey_b> ur looking at some horrirble old stuff
[02:45:31] <Monkey_b> sec
[02:45:32] <Trisox>  http://jsfiddle.net/YJd8Y/1/ there
[02:46:00] <Monkey_b> there
[02:46:01] <Monkey_b> try now
[02:46:01] <Monkey_b> http://jsfiddle.net/YJd8Y/3/
[02:46:04] <Monkey_b> try this one
[02:46:27] <Monkey_b> look at this example, when u remove divB, the toggleclass toggling goes backwards
[02:46:39] <Monkey_b> yet if u run the same example with css instead of toggleclass, it works fine
[02:48:25] <Monkey_b> worst comes to worst i can start using css instead of toggleclass, but i like toggleclass since with jqueryUI it supports animations
[02:48:34] <Monkey_b> and i dont like having css attributes in code either
[02:50:31] <Trisox> works right?
[02:51:08] <Monkey_b> toggleclass doesnt
[02:52:05] <Cork> Monkey_b: well it works as expected
[02:52:09] <Monkey_b> intended behavior: when you mouseover anywhere in divA the text in divB should turn red
[02:52:14] <Cork> but you forget that toggle switches it
[02:52:16] <Monkey_b> err divC
[02:52:32] <Monkey_b> it works fine until u click on 'remove me'
[02:52:34] <Cork> and you get the problem cause toggle triggers one extra time when the element is removed
[02:52:42] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/YJd8Y/4/
[02:53:00] <Monkey_b> right
[02:53:02] <Monkey_b> ohh
[02:53:04] <Cork> the problem is you expect to ever only get an out after an move
[02:53:13] <Monkey_b> so i should use addclass and removeclass?
[02:53:16] <Cork> but you get get the over twice
[02:53:26] <Cork> Monkey_b: well when you want this kind of behavior yes
[02:53:30] <Monkey_b> ok
[02:53:31] <Monkey_b> gotcha
[02:53:32] <Monkey_b> thanks :)
[02:53:37] <Cork> or toggle('class-name', true/false)
[02:53:58] <Cork> toggle without a direction is kinda uncertain what it will do
[02:54:08] <Cork> it is good for when you want to do something like "blink"
[02:54:16] <Monkey_b> ok sweet
[02:54:27] <Cork> but in most other situations you want to control exactly what direction it should go
[02:55:28] <Monkey_b> thanks cork
[02:55:33] <Cork> np
[02:55:34] <Monkey_b> im passing the boolean in myself now
[03:41:19] <maccam_> does this make sense to anybody?
[03:41:29] <maccam_> http://pastebin.com/index/1jyFx21V
[03:41:56] <maccam_> trying to mash up variables into new variables, then outputting those on the page
[03:43:26] <xKraty> maccam_: not sure if you can do it
[03:43:35] <xKraty> maccam_: i'd rather use an object
[03:44:07] <maccam_> I'm a noob when it comes to JS and jquery.  Can you give me a few pointers to make this work?
[03:44:10] <maccam_> xkraty
[03:44:24] <xKraty> hold on
[03:46:59] <xKraty> maccam_: how it sounds for you? http://pastebin.com/SLq7z2UT
[03:47:51] <maccam_> let me try that
[03:50:43] <xKraty> brb lunch
[03:58:39] <lite_> how do i "trigger" a custom event that bubbles downwards?
[03:59:56] <Ahmed> hey guys, I’m trying to do something like $('input').on(‘click’, function(event){ this.child.click(); }
[04:00:18] <Ahmed> I’m not sure what’s the correct syntax to fire the click even on the child element when the parent is clicked.
[04:00:21] <Ahmed> Does that make sense?
[04:18:58] <Cork> lite_: events don't bubble downwards
[04:19:04] <Cork> that isn't possible
[04:19:19] <lite_> hm
[04:19:24] <lite_> okay
[04:19:43] <Cork> Ahmed: $(this).children().click()
[04:19:51] <Cork> or if you want to target a specific one you can
[04:20:44] <maccam_> xKraty it says TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'prices[partInfo][sizeInfo][conditionInfo]')
[04:21:10] <Cork> maccam_: your calling something on a missing object
[04:21:36] <maccam_> this is what I have:
[04:21:36] <maccam_> http://pastebin.com/SLq7z2UT
[04:22:21] <maccam_> is it missing something?
[04:22:43] <Cork> yes
[04:22:53] <Cork> hmm
[04:23:18] <Cork> have you checked what the values in the different variables are? (btw define your variables!)
[04:23:35] <maccam_> what do you mean define my variables?
[04:23:42] <maccam_> sorry, I'm a noob with jquery
[04:23:42] <Cork> var <variable name>
[04:23:49] <Cork> it isn't jquery it is plain js
[04:23:58] <maccam_> even worse ;)
[04:24:21] <Cork> anyway the code except for the definition part is valid
[04:24:24] <Cork> and should work
[04:24:31] <Cork> i suspect you get some value you don't expect in there
[04:25:08] <maccam_> you mean not having the var before the declarations?
[04:25:56] <Cork> yes
[04:26:26] <Cork> <variable name> = value; is the same as window.<variable name> = value;
[04:26:31] <Cork> so it is globally accessable
[04:26:41] <Cork> and can get ugly from that
[04:27:22] <maccam_> so inspector says the error is in reference to this line:
[04:27:22] <maccam_> 	var price = prices[modelInfo][storageInfo][conditionInfo];
[04:28:09] <maccam_> (replace out partInfo and sizeInfo with modelInfo and storageInfo respectively)
[04:28:19] <Cork> yes cause come of the keys doesn't exist in the object
[04:28:27] <Cork> so; again check the values in the variables
[04:28:41] <maccam_> so it must have all the keys to function properly?
[04:28:43] <xKraty> back
[04:29:01] <xKraty> maccam_: yeah the value have to be defined of course
[04:29:34] <maccam_> It should have all levels of the keys, but not all the key:value pairs I'll have in the end
[04:29:53] <Cork> maccam_: have you checked that the values you get is what you expect?
[04:30:07] <Cork> with 99% security that is the problem
[04:30:18] <Cork> an extra space, a case difference or something like that
[04:31:29] <xKraty> maccam_: wrap it in if ( typeof prices[partInfo][sizeInfo][conditionInfo] != 'undefined' ) { }
[04:32:06] <xKraty> but if you says you have all keys it shouldn't give error
[04:32:24] <Cork> (don't assume those things)
[04:38:07] <maccam_> I'm so lost
[04:38:48] <maccam_> Cork or xKraty — I can't share the link publicly, but I would like to share it with you somehow privately so you can see it in action
[04:40:06] <Cork> maccam_: have you checked what the values in the variables you use with the object is?
[04:40:16] <Cork> the data you grab from data-value that is
[04:40:32] <Cork> if those are what you expect
[04:40:44] <Cork> check each level in the object nesting and see what things work
[04:40:56] <Cork> should be straight forward
[04:41:50] <tobago> which jQuery plugin do you advise for a simple satrt/stop/reset watch?
[04:42:40] <maccam_> would you mind checking it for me Cork?
[04:42:43] <maccam_> http://pastebin.com/0C4fPmBr
[04:43:15] <maccam_> just to see if anything big stands out to you
[04:44:54] <Cork> $('.model-chooser .model-link.selected').length == 0
[04:45:50] <tirengarfio> I expected an alert when clicking on the second radio button here: http://jsfiddle.net/h6j58/2/
[04:47:43] <tobago> i need a simple clock plugin counting up, having a start and stop button.
[04:48:22] <maccam_> Cork that should have data, right?
[04:48:30] <maccam_> I can't see why it says it doesn't
[04:48:37] <Cork> maccam_: one sec i found where things are now
[04:49:07] <Cork> $('.storage-chooser .storage-link.selected').attr('data-value') == "64gb"
[04:49:12] <Cork> not "storage_64gb"
[04:50:04] <Cork> tirengarfio: no js doesn't work like that
[04:50:10] <Cork> tirengarfio: ready fires when the page loads
[04:50:22] <Cork> if radioName is checked at that time you get the alert
[04:50:32] <Cork> else nothing will happen
[04:50:43] <Cork> you don't bind a click event listener
[04:51:12] <maccam_> ok Cork, that is fixed. I changed the class name instead of the data-value value
[04:51:16] <maccam_> before
[04:51:44] <Cork> tobago: check for jquery counter or cronos there should be plenty
[04:52:01] <Cork> maccam_: don't you know how to use the developer tools?
[04:52:17] <Cork> this should be simple to just run the selectors in the console and see what data you get
[04:52:24] <maccam_> kind of.  Like I said, I'm a jquery/JS noob
[04:52:40] <Cork> this has very little to do with js/jquery
[04:52:45] <maccam_> I can kill CSS, but never learned js very well
[04:52:48] <Cork> and very much about using the browser developer tools
[04:53:02] <maccam_> console and js are kind of in my blind spot
[04:53:11] <Cork> are you even trying?
[04:53:32] <maccam_> I've been trying since 8am, which was 23 hours ago
[04:53:38] <Cork> then go to sleep
[04:53:49] <Cork> and start again when you've slept
[04:53:54] <Cork> this shouldn't be hard
[04:53:56] <maccam_> I feel like I'm so close...but I can't quite get this last bit
[04:54:08] <Cork> its just about checking what values you have in your variables
[04:54:08] <maccam_> it's driving me nuts
[04:54:25] <Cork> and no i'm not going to sit here and run the developer tools for you
[04:54:47] <Cork> just copy the lines when you are at the place where this code runs
[04:55:00] <Cork> and then just run the commands in the console and inspect the values
[04:55:11] <Cork> (or use breakpoints little more advanced)
[04:55:35] <maccam_> you make it sound so easy
[04:55:40] <maccam_> actually, it still doesn't sound easy
[04:55:43] <Cork> well... it is
[04:56:06] <maccam_> [Error] TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'prices[modelInfo][storageInfo][conditionInfo]') 	(anonymous function) (home, line 535) 	dispatch (jquery.min.js, line 5) 	handle (jquery.min.js, line 5)
[04:56:15] <maccam_> what does this error mean?
[04:56:29] <maccam_> it doesn't seem very specific
[04:56:29] <Cork> that one of the variables doesn't exist in the object
[04:56:34] <Cork> it is very specific
[04:56:50] <Cork> js> var a = {}; a['b']['c']
[04:56:57] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[04:57:02] <Cork> a['b'] == undefined
[04:57:13] <Cork> a['b']['c'] == undefined['c']
[04:57:31] <Cork> and as undefined isn't an object you can't grab for 'c' on it
[05:09:34] <RWOverdi_> I'm looking for a dropdown-checklist like github has. http://spoonx.nl/caps/c4a153.png I tried select2 but it only supports tags rather than checklists. Any suggestions? :)
[05:14:02] <Misan> select2 has many addons/plugins/variations
[05:16:46] <RWOverdijk> Misan, Any idea where I can browse those?
[05:17:02] <Misan> hmm not sure right now..
[05:17:11] <Misan> github is a good place to start ;)
[05:17:31] <Misan> take a look into the official documentation of select2 if it points out any other addons or variations
[05:17:45] <Misan> then take a look at the pull requests if someone has already created it, but not merged
[05:18:48] <RWOverdijk> Misan, I did do that. I couldn't see a thing. I know how to build it, but it only works when I "hack" my way around it.
[05:19:55] <Misan> found something for you
[05:19:55] <Misan> http://www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget
[05:20:00] <Misan> demo: http://www.erichynds.com/examples/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/demos/#basic
[05:20:38] <Misan> first hit on google
[05:20:47] <RWOverdijk> I did come across that.
[05:20:58] <RWOverdijk> But it's pretty crappy.
[05:21:04] <RWOverdijk> I'll make one :)
[05:21:19] <RWOverdijk> Using select2. Thanks anyway!
[05:22:08] <Misan> well you could say, its open for change :P
[05:22:22] <RWOverdijk> Well... Yeah. You could.
[05:39:26] <Tekla> "$('.datepicker').each(function(){$(this).datepicker("setDate",$.datepicker.formatDate('yy. MM d.'),$(this).datepicker('getDate'))});" <-- the getDate returns todays date instead of the value of the field ... but if i use the chrome debug and check the value by manually refreshing its value it returns the correct date :s
[05:46:14] <Ahmed> Thanks!
[06:00:43] <Sendoushi> guys, slider plugins. do you know any good?
[06:00:53] <Sendoushi> i don't really like sliders but on this case i have to use one
[06:03:33] <Cork> Sendoushi: there is one in jquery ui
[06:03:38] <Cork> (unless you mean slide shows)
[06:04:02] <Sendoushi> i just need a slider left right
[06:04:10] <Sendoushi> to navigate through news (divs)
[06:04:15] <Sendoushi> like quotes
[06:04:16] <Cork> ?g jquery ui slider
[06:04:18] <b-ot> Cork: Slider | jQuery UI → http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[06:04:34] <Sendoushi> but i didn't want to use jquery ui as the whole. is it amd ready?
[06:04:57] <Cork> hmm
[06:05:22] <Cork> Sendoushi: didn't get a straight answer
[06:05:28] <Cork> are you sure you means slider?
[06:05:31] <Cork> and not a slideshow?
[06:05:42] <Sendoushi> i mean slider
[06:05:48] <Sendoushi> one with < and > ehehe
[06:06:00] <Cork> < > ?
[06:06:04] <Sendoushi> well it could also be a slideshow to be fair
[06:06:15] <Cork> sounds like you mean slideshow
[06:06:17] <Sendoushi> actually,  maybe it is more accurate
[06:06:21] <Cork> check the link if you want to see what a slider is
[06:06:27] <Cork> it's nothing the like
[06:06:47] <Cork> sadly many shortens slideshow to slider and ignore that slider means something totally different
[06:06:55] <Sendoushi> oh yes yes you're right sorry
[06:07:14] <Cork> Sendoushi: there is plenty of those
[06:07:25] <Cork> Sendoushi: you could even write one in css3 only
[06:07:44] <Sendoushi> hmm indeed i could... hmmmmmm ok then
[06:07:58] <Cork> but if you want it in jquery
[06:08:05] <Cork> just google jquery slideshow
[06:08:09] <Sendoushi> though in this case i want it responsive i guess css3 won't help me much with that in this case
[06:08:10] <Cork> you will find a lot of plugins
[06:08:20] <Sendoushi> i know. i was wondering if you knew already a good one ehehe
[06:08:23] <Cork> Sendoushi: it can actually
[06:08:53] <Sendoushi> then how would you calculate the left to move the slideshow?
[06:08:59] <Cork> http://wowslider.com/css3-slideshow-pure-domino.html
[06:09:07] <Cork> an example
[06:09:18] <Cork> (it runs without js enabled)
[06:09:31] <Sendoushi> ok i'll check it later thanks :)
[06:09:37] <Cork> http://www.creativejuiz.fr/trytotry/juizy-slideshow-full-css3-html5/#sl_i3
[06:09:39] <Cork> another example
[06:10:23] <Cork> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/CSS3FluidParallaxSlideshow/
[06:10:42] <Cork> Sendoushi: one solution is to use :target and hashes
[06:10:53] <Sendoushi> ah i see what you mean
[06:10:58] <Cork> Sendoushi: another one is to use radio buttons
[06:11:09] <Cork> and style based on :checked
[06:12:05] <Tekla> jsfiddle.net/S7H97/6/ <-- why does it reset the date if i push the button? :(
[06:12:48] <xKraty> Tekla: it format for me
[06:13:04] <Tekla> ?
[06:13:58] <xKraty> Tekla: if i press foo it format the date to italian
[06:14:21] <Tekla> but if you select a date other than today the date will be changed to today
[06:14:28] <Tekla> that's the problem :)
[06:14:47] <Tekla> it should only change the format not the date
[06:21:30] <xKraty> hold on
[06:23:37] <SamuraiDio> is anything better to use .get(0) instead of [0]?
[06:23:40] <Tekla> jsfiddle.net/S7H97/7/ <-- i've added an alert ... the getDate returns today's date no matter what's set
[06:24:30] <SamuraiDio> isn't it slower?
[06:29:39] <ghostlines> ahoy, I'm trying to access the body of an iframe like so $('iframe').find('body') but it's not returning anything
[06:29:57] <ghostlines> i can however get the iframe by just doing $('iframe')
[06:31:51] <xKraty> ghostlines: as far as i know you can access the parent from the iframe but you can't access the iframe since it's a world a part, $(iframe) should return the iframe object not the content in it
[06:32:02] <xKraty> Tekla: it's weird, it's struggling me
[06:32:22] <Tekla> xKraty: well... i'm glad to hear it's not just me :P
[06:32:38] <xKraty> Tekla: it's something stupid for sure but i'm not getting what
[06:34:09] <xKraty> Tekla: look http://jsfiddle.net/S7H97/8/ i made a test function
[06:34:20] <xKraty> Tekla: it's something you make that resets date
[06:34:31] <foobar_> hey! anyone know of some lightweight smooth page scrolling plugin. something like nicescroll but smaller than that.
[06:35:06] <xKraty> foobar_: you could stylize your scrollbar with css3
[06:35:55] <ghostlines> xKraty ohh k thx!
[06:35:56] <foobar_> xKraty, I want smooth scrolling effect basically. inertia scroll or whatever its called
[06:38:08] <Tekla> xKraty: jsfiddle.net/S7H97/9/
[06:38:28] <Tekla> the date is reset by the regional setting change
[06:39:03] <Tekla> the .val() returns to date selected while the getDate function returns the crap
[06:40:35] <ankurk_> I can finally sort my table by date but I have an issue again. I have a hidden row below each row which shows more information, I want that to be sorted as well, how can I do that? Here's the issue in JSBin, http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/1/edit
[06:43:00] <Tekla> and it's not even my changes ... it's the default $.datepicker.setDefaults($.datepicker.regional["en-GB"]) function
[06:44:24] <ankurk_> If you click the plus button, it will show more information but after sorting it doesn't
[06:45:10] <xKraty> Tekla: i'm trying something
[06:47:06] <Tekla> xKraty v10 works
[06:47:08] <Tekla> a
[06:47:51] <xKraty> Tekla: cool, what you changed then?
[06:48:12] <Tekla> i've added an alert b4 the $.datepicker.setDefaults() section
[06:48:22] <Tekla> that shows the value of the field
[06:48:37] <Tekla> but that's not a solution i can use :P
[06:49:05] <xKraty> lol
[06:49:40] <ankurk_> I might not be selecting the hidden rows
[06:51:52] <ankurk_> doesn't work :(
[06:51:55] <ankurk_> *sigh*
[06:54:37] <xKraty> Tekla: i was trying something like that http://jsfiddle.net/S7H97/11/
[07:04:09] <ankurk_> Can anyone help me with my issue? :)
[07:06:50] <TheEternalAbyss> so I have a question about order of execution when it comes to jquery. I have a <select> element, which on page ready, populates with <option> elements from a db. I have a jquery click event that should execute depending on which option is then clicked on. For some reason the click event appears to do nothing. Does it not see the <option> within select cause it was populated after the DOM loaded?
[07:07:41] <TheEternalAbyss> I hope that makes sense by the way, I understand without seeing the code it can be a bit confusing
[07:08:50] <xKraty> Tekla: there we go! http://jsfiddle.net/S7H97/13/
[07:09:05] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: I think you'd be better off using $('select').on('change', doStuff). Not sure the browser handles those options properly.
[07:09:41] <TheEternalAbyss> that could work
[07:09:44] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: You can get the value of the option with $(this).val() in there... if you need something on the option element like a data attribute you could do like $(this).find('option:selected').data('foo')
[07:09:53] <BillCriswell> inside the select onchange.
[07:10:14] <ankurk_> I have a hidden row below each row which shows more information, I want that to be sorted as well, how can I do that? Here's the issue in JSBin, http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/1/edit
[07:10:25] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm interesting. Yes I need the value of the option cause I have to load graphs based on what option is clicked
[07:10:34] <TheEternalAbyss> I'll have to give that a try BillCriswell
[07:10:47] <TheEternalAbyss> Thank you much appreciated
[07:10:57] <xKraty> Tekla: i forgot to set the default regional but you should be done with that
[07:10:58] <BillCriswell> IF you need the option just $(this).val() would return that.
[07:11:10] <TheEternalAbyss> yup, noted :)
[07:11:23] <masscrx> to what should I bind .bind('ajax:success', function(){ alert("Success!"); }); ? I want to handle this ajax response after success delete items (submit a form)
[07:11:24] <Tekla> xKraty: so instead of changed defaults after first use only change settings for specific field?
[07:11:48] <Tekla> xKraty: thanks :)
[07:12:09] <xKraty> Tekla: i swear default should be set once only, there the 'default' name
[07:12:13] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks again, if I have questions I'll ask again ;)
[07:12:30] <Tekla> thank you
[07:12:46] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:12:50] <xKraty> Tekla: if you look deeper on the demo http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization they include an array with languages setup and just tell your datepicker which one to use
[07:15:42] <BillCriswell> Never knew you could sort dates like that.
[07:19:48] <xKraty> Tekla: my lime crashed, all fine?
[07:20:28] <ankurk_> BillCriswell, you talking to me?
[07:20:37] <jamto11> if i add li:hover {background:yellow} to my css file, is that considered obstrusive js or ujs?
[07:20:39] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Haha mostly to myself.
[07:20:56] <ankurk_> Can you help me a bit, I am kinda stuck
[07:20:57] <ankurk_> :P
[07:21:04] <BillCriswell> Never tried to just sort data objects, always tried to make them into an integer.
[07:21:17] <ankurk_> But it seems to work for me
[07:21:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah I think it's fine, I just didn't expect it to work for some reason. I was just ignorant to it haha
[07:21:53] <ankurk_> Sorting works fine, the part on which I am stuck is how to sort the hidden row as well
[07:23:06] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Instead of tr.punch_list_summary just use tr
[07:23:30] <ankurk_> then how would I select the dates?
[07:24:05] <ankurk_> selecting only tr doesn't work since I am using "children().eq(2).text()" to get the dates
[07:29:01] <ankurk_> May be I need to change table layout, but I do need to show more information
[07:29:21] <BillCriswell> At this point the HTML is making your Javascript a lot more complicated. I'd try some different HTML to keep the Javascript simple.
[07:30:01] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Do you need the hidden divs in the source? Can they be added dynamically?
[07:31:15] <ankurk_> I don't have any hidden divs
[07:31:25] <BillCriswell> rows, sorry
[07:31:35] <BillCriswell> This channel leads me to call every element a div haah
[07:31:50] <ankurk_> oh, yeah. I need them to show more information
[07:32:32] <ankurk_> moreover, data is coming in from PHP
[07:33:49] <ankurk_> my boss told me I need to bind the rows o.O
[07:35:09] <ankurk_> I think I am trying to do the impossible
[07:35:56] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/mavebize/1/edit is along the lines of what I was thinking.
[07:36:10] <fabiobik> how to get the file url preview from a input type="file"
[07:36:17] <fabiobik> i can get file.name
[07:36:22] <fabiobik> but not file.url
[07:36:37] <BillCriswell> fabiobik: You'd only be able to get a fake path.
[07:36:59] <BillCriswell> You won't be able to get the real path that the file actually lives.
[07:37:07] <fabiobik> BillCriswell,  how to?
[07:37:44] <xKraty> fabiobik: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4459419
[07:38:07] <BillCriswell> this.value
[07:38:18] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/vigisuyo/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:39:02] <xKraty> lol nevermind i missread X_x
[07:39:40] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: More information row is actually coming in from PHP. Would that be an issue
[07:39:42] <BillCriswell> xKraty: I may be misunderstanding too...
[07:40:41] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Are you basically doing like <?php foreach( $rows as $row ): ?> HTML Stuff <?php endforeach; ?> ?
[07:41:29] <xKraty> ankurk_: what are you trying to do?
[07:42:04] <ankurk_> BillCriswell, yep something like that, http://pastebin.com/Uq15xZSC
[07:42:48] <ankurk_> xKraty: I am sorting table rows by dates but I have hidden rows that show more information as well. I want them to get sorted as well. http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/1/edit
[07:43:51] <xKraty> ankurk_: i did such things by using http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[07:44:11] <xKraty> ankurk_: for the more info you could make an ajax
[07:44:29] <ankurk_> xKraty: Main problem is I am not supposed use a plugin
[07:44:44] <xKraty> ankurk_: just don't tell anyone :D
[07:44:57] <ankurk_> My boss will know :/
[07:45:40] <xKraty> ankurk_: it's stupid to struggle on such complicate sorting when there is many usefull plugins for
[07:45:50] <xKraty> but if your boss want that
[07:46:16] <ankurk_> xKraty: I know it's stupid, I initially wanted to use a library or plugin
[07:46:32] <xKraty> the best way would be an ajax anyway
[07:46:42] <xKraty> or an headshot to your boss
[07:46:53] <xKraty> whatever makes you feel better!
[07:47:57] <ankurk_> lol second option seems better
[07:48:15] <ankurk_> then he tells me do things in simple way, what an irony
[07:48:19] <ankurk_> *to
[07:48:39] <phidah> I have an ajax request sent to the backend (same domain) - but Internet Explorer 11 doesn't send along the cookies. I have tried setting a P3P header but that didn't seem to solve the problem. The cookie was set in a previous AJAX request.
[07:48:53] <andolf> hey guys
[07:49:44] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Is the only thing going into that hidden row description, requirements and dependency?
[07:49:53] <andolf> I need help pointing me in the direction of doing something like this: I have a offers section of website, and there is more than 1 offer. I'd like to have them in a list, and fade in an out of each one. What's the best route to take for this?
[07:50:03] <andolf> on a website*
[07:50:22] <ankurk_> BillCriswell, yep for now these three are going into that hidden row.
[07:50:52] <xKraty> andolf: a slider?
[07:51:14] <andolf> Nah, only articles I find are for images, not text
[07:51:42] <andolf> And I don't think it would work as well, plus it doesn't need all the fancy stuff. just needs to fade in and out with different offers
[07:52:29] <BillCriswell> Ideally this should be an array of objects that you can work with. You shouldn't have to wrestle with HTML like this. You could however hold the data in data attributes like I showed you earlier: Here's a more clear example: http://jsbin.com/mavebize/3/edit?js,output
[07:53:06] <xKraty> andolf: http://demo.dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/ nivo slider should handle html aswell but well you could simply use a function called with setTimeout(offer, seconds) and do it by yourself
[07:53:15] <BillCriswell> HEre it is even clearer: http://jsbin.com/mavebize/4/edit
[07:53:34] <Ownix> Could calling draggable on a collection twice cause any issues?
[07:54:05] <BillCriswell> Ownix: I think it's built into it to test to see if it's already a draggable so you should be cool.
[07:54:17] <xKraty> andolf: where offer is function that simply show the next one
[07:54:18] <Ownix> Okay thanks
[07:55:09] <andolf> xKraty: okay, I'll have a look into it. I've only just started learning Jquery, so I'm fairly new to all of this.
[07:56:06] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: http://jsbin.com/mavebize/5/edit?html here it is if you want to be able to open more than one.
[07:56:31] <xKraty> andolf: if you are new and want to learn more you could make it with fadeIn/fadeOut function for understanding how it works
[07:57:22] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: http://jsbin.com/mavebize/6/edit?html,js,output my final version lol.
[07:57:28] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: it should play well with the sort right?
[07:57:47] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: It won't be aware of the sort.
[07:57:57] <BillCriswell> It just puts a new tr below the one that was clicked.
[07:58:03] <xKraty> BillCriswell: if you keep on click it keep adding rows :D
[07:58:19] <BillCriswell> xKraty: Dammit.
[07:58:45] <ankurk_> xKraty found a bug :D
[07:58:54] <xKraty> BillCriswell: more info for ankurk's users :D
[07:59:02] <andolf> xKraty, cool man, thanks!
[08:00:10] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/mavebize/7/edit there we go.
[08:00:49] <xKraty> i'll look for another bug
[08:00:57] <BillCriswell> xKraty: Of course. :-p
[08:01:17] <ankurk_> I was gonna suggest toggle too
[08:01:19] <ankurk_> :P
[08:01:51] <ankurk_> I have a very stupid question. how will the PHP values will go in there? o.O
[08:01:58] <xKraty> ankurk_: why don't you use a data-attr on the tr
[08:02:08] <xKraty> i mean
[08:02:20] <xKraty> main tr data-sorter = mysortr-1
[08:02:34] <xKraty> the info tr data-sorter = mysroter-2
[08:02:38] <xKraty> mysorter*
[08:02:41] <ankurk_> data-description, data-requirement like that?
[08:02:55] <BillCriswell> data-description="$row['description']". You may need to sanitize it properly.
[08:03:24] <xKraty> if you find the right way to name it when you sort the rows should sort together
[08:03:34] <ankurk_> hmm, I might be on right track now
[08:03:57] <ankurk_> you guys are awesome! I owe you guys beers
[08:05:00] <xKraty> for example when i need an array sorted by date i just cast to string in us ( or sql not sure ) format and use the normal sort() function as string and it works
[08:05:06] <xKraty> dunno if you get the point
[08:06:46] <ankurk_> I get your point slightly, xKraty
[08:08:49] <BillCriswell> I need to trust FTP "Sync" options more.
[08:09:08] <BillCriswell> I must have had a terrible experience ones and never touched it again till now, working well haha.
[08:09:29] <xKraty> BillCriswell: you still using using ftp :O
[08:09:49] <BillCriswell> xKraty: For some projects!
[08:12:09] <xKraty> BillCriswell: i made a workaround for old servers, i can now kinda use push everywhere
[08:13:30] <BillCriswell> xKraty: To be honest I'm not very familiar with a lot of the like... server type of stuff.
[08:13:58] <xKraty> BillCriswell: when i started use git my life changed, no more files left on local!
[08:14:31] <xKraty> BillCriswell: now they made a GUI even for windows
[08:14:35] <BillCriswell> I know the basics of git and that's about it. We use SVN at work for the time being... don't even know that very well.
[08:15:17] <xKraty> never used svn but as my master speech it's a pain in the ass
[08:16:07] <BillCriswell> I haven't really had to put it to work yet so I'm not sure haha
[08:16:31] <xKraty> ahaha
[08:16:35] <BillCriswell> I commit once in a while and update but that's about it.
[08:16:56] <xKraty> that's bad, if you broke something you can't rollback
[08:17:24] <xKraty> also if you cowork with someone how many times we fcked mate file :\
[08:17:46] <BillCriswell> I see a "revert..." option when I right click so I think that'll make enough sense when I need it ( hopefully ).
[08:18:07] <xKraty> :D
[08:18:18] <BillCriswell> We're pretty good about that so far here, only two of us for now.
[08:18:36] <Velveeta> yeah, you can revert to a previous revision and then reapply the changesets manually until you get back up to the head revision
[08:18:52] <Velveeta> i've worked in larger-scale teams on svn, it's not that big of an issue
[08:18:54] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That sounds like a blast.
[08:19:35] <Velveeta> yeah it's a pain in the ass whenever that's necessary, but it's not that difficult
[08:19:39] <xKraty> yeah but if you commit once in a while when you rollback you risk to have the "new project" dir lol
[08:19:40] <Velveeta> just make sure you pull and merge often ;)
[08:19:55] <xKraty> Velveeta: that's the point :D
[08:20:09] <BillCriswell> I could be a little better at doing that for sure haha
[08:21:04] <xKraty> you should since if you broke something the problem is your, if someone else fix things for you, im jelous about =|
[08:22:11] <BillCriswell> Haha I'll let you know when I break something.
[08:23:52] <Velveeta> lol
[08:24:16] <xKraty> Thanks, that's appreciated!
[08:24:18] <Velveeta> at our level we don't write bugs, we just write misinterpreted features, amiright?
[08:24:39] <xKraty> Velveeta: so call me Master XD
[08:24:41] <Velveeta> "that was this awesome feature i wrote to throw a fatal error, looks like it's working exactly as designed!"
[08:24:54] <BillCriswell> "It's always supposed to do that, sir."
[08:25:32] <Velveeta> "maybe they just need to upgrade their browser to a real one that can understand what i'm throwing at it"
[08:25:55] <BillCriswell> "Tell them 'Fuck their browser'"
[08:26:21] <xKraty> "try F5"
[08:26:36] <BillCriswell> "They have to do a HARD refresh"
[08:27:56] <xKraty> fortunately my boss never look at code
[08:28:09] <xKraty> my last awesome function get a parameter for autofit map
[08:28:15] <xKraty> only if you pass "yeahbitch"
[08:28:18] <xKraty> lol
[08:28:47] <BillCriswell> Whenever I hear "bitch" I imagine Aaron Paul saying it.
[08:29:43] <xKraty> breaking bad was even worst then met, more more more!
[08:32:13] <jim_j> hi all
[08:32:38] <jim_j> I'm implementing the 2nd example here but it's not triggering the php function after the js ajax call;  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15273292/wordpress-submit-a-form-using-ajax
[08:32:51] <jim_j> I'm trying to see if the example is right?
[08:33:52] <xKraty> jim_j: php is executed before
[08:34:20] <jim_j> xkraty, but when I put an 'echo' in the function, nothing is happening
[08:34:33] <jim_j> in the 'ajax_action_anyName' function
[08:35:19] <xKraty> jim_j: what you mean with 2nd example?
[08:35:33] <xKraty> this ? http://stackoverflow.com/a/15563638
[08:36:09] <jim_j> xKraty, ye
[08:36:10] <jim_j> yes
[08:37:35] <xKraty> i don't really like/understand wordpress
[08:38:03] <xKraty> it's more like a wordpress question than a jquery
[08:38:42] <jim_j> ah ok I see
[08:38:43] <jim_j> thanks
[08:39:09] <xKraty> sorry :\
[08:46:58] <Velveeta> i use wordpress, and even i don't really understand it
[08:47:06] <jim_j> :)
[08:47:28] <Velveeta> as far as "liking" it.. meh, it's a means to an end, content publication, and it doesn't really get in the way of that for me, so it's usable enough for my purposes
[08:47:36] <Velveeta> and easy enough to find plugins for and keep up to date
[08:47:58] <BillCriswell> I hate the word "plugin".
[08:48:01] <Velveeta> i just stumbled across this on twitter from a new follower, and almost actually laughed out loud: “Q: How to generate a random string? A: Put a fresh student in front of vi and tell him to quit.”
[08:48:24] <xKraty> Velveeta: lol
[08:48:31] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: When I learned how to quit in vim I felt like a pro.
[08:48:34] <BillCriswell> :q right?
[08:48:46] <Velveeta> power userrrrrr!
[08:49:15] <xKraty> BillCriswell: you feel the power when you toggle on a key NerdTreeToggle
[08:50:08] <xKraty> w/o starting a war, what editor you using?
[08:50:14] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what that really means haha
[08:50:25] <xKraty> lolz
[08:50:36] <Velveeta> on my machine, i use sublime
[08:50:39] <xKraty> NerdTree is the sidebar with folder tree
[08:50:48] <Velveeta> from the command line of a terminal, i use nano :D
[08:51:02] <Velveeta> unless i have need of global search/replace w/ regex support, that's about the only time i ever launch vim
[08:51:04] <xKraty> +1 for sublime, i really love it
[08:51:08] <Velveeta> same here
[08:51:21] <xKraty> just passed on sublime 3
[08:51:40] <xKraty> notepad++ it's some old memories now, but first love is first love
[08:51:46] <Velveeta> yeah i haven't loaded 3 yet as it's still in beta, running 2.something here
[08:52:08] <Velveeta> i've used notepad++, but only on one of our windows servers if i have to edit a config file or something
[08:52:35] <xKraty> i feel good with the new version and never had crash for now
[08:53:38] <duch_kazatel> noepad++ is all right.
[08:53:42] <duch_kazatel> *notepad++
[08:54:00] <duch_kazatel> glad I swapped to sublime text though.
[08:54:32] <xKraty> what i most like on sublime is the command + p for open files  and the command shift p for other things
[08:54:46] <duch_kazatel> yeah the command palette is awesome.
[08:54:54] <duch_kazatel> add package control and life gets super simple.
[08:55:01] <xKraty> otherwise on notepad++ i had all i needed with the plugins
[08:55:21] <xKraty> i installed few days ago a plugin for markdown preview
[08:55:43] <xKraty> you command shift p -> markdown -> enter and badabumtiss! it open browser with preview
[08:58:41] <xKraty> all right i'm off work! bb
[08:59:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I picked up Sublime to replace TextMate when I felt like TextMate was done for haha.
[09:23:15] <duch_kazatel> protip: if you're going to let non-developers push markup to your frontend, make sure you've got some kind of validator.
[09:29:31] <Ownix> The float; left; is preventing .container from being responsive, can someone help with this issue?
[09:29:40] <Ownix> I worked on a fiddle to show the issue http://jsfiddle.net/C5X44/
[09:31:16] <Ownix> Sorry this fiddle is with my saved changes http://jsfiddle.net/C5X44/1/
[09:41:45] <d0de> I have two functions, one with a removeClass and one with an addClass . The second one will add any arbitrary class, but for some reason won't add the class I've removed with the first function. Why would that be?
[09:42:22] <nerk> can anyone tell me what is wrong with this?
[09:42:24] <nerk> http://jsfiddle.net/4T8zs/
[09:42:49] <d0de> like this: http://jsbin.com/
[09:42:50] <duch_kazatel> d0de have some code to share?
[09:43:14] <nerk> it toggles the checkbox to checked once.. then keeps it unchecked after the first run through... I guess it has to do with how it's being unchecked?
[09:44:36] <duch_kazatel> d0de that's an empty link...
[09:45:16] <duch_kazatel> nerk you want to use prop('checked', true) instead.
[09:45:30] <nerk> I'll try that.. but I have tried prop('checked')
[09:45:36] <nerk> what does the true flag do?
[09:45:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4T8zs/2/
[09:45:49] <nerk> oh.. for setting it you mean
[09:45:52] <duch_kazatel> yea.
[09:46:08] <axsuul> Can anyone recommend a table sorting library?
[09:46:27] <d0de> dutch_kazatel, sorry, jsbin is being weird. It's this: http://pastebin.com/dtsSP5Dj
[09:46:57] <duch_kazatel> d0de you're aware that jquery does that test for you, right?
[09:46:59] <nerk> duch: great, thx
[09:47:07] <duch_kazatel> you can add/remove wihtout checking first.
[09:47:22] <d0de> huh, I didn't know that
[09:47:58] <d0de> but there's actually some other stuff in the function that needs the check, I just took it out because it didn't seem relevant to this problem
[09:48:08] <duch_kazatel> d0de could you create a working fiddle?
[09:48:16] <d0de> ok
[09:49:56] <decx> nerk why not just use a label? you don't need js to extend a clickable area for a checkbox
[09:50:18] <nerk> decx: you'd have to understand the implementation
[09:50:34] <decx> yeah i was just wondering
[09:50:36] <nerk> it's an image that represents bold of text.. it's a gray button with a B in it.
[09:50:47] <nerk> when you click it.. the B image toggles to a highlighted image
[09:50:55] <nerk> and changes the checked value of the hidden input
[09:53:56] <decx> yeah i did image replacers for checkboxes myself before, but i only use js for the presenational aspect and let a normal labelclick handel the formchange
[09:54:04] <mil2571> is it normal for jquery ajax to stop sending server request after it gets a 500 back? I'm working on a web app and anytime I get a 500 chrome will no longer send any more request to the server.
[09:55:59] <duch_kazatel> mil2571 nope.  sounds like maybe you've got an error bombing out your JS.
[09:56:12] <Tingle2> is there a way to iterate over objects in a order?
[09:56:28] <duch_kazatel> Tingle2 no.  order is not guaranteed unless it's an array.
[09:56:43] <duch_kazatel> Tingle2 unless you have, like, numbers you can key off of.
[09:57:27] <Tingle2> so doing var $messageHolders = $('#user-messages-index-list > li'); wont return the li's ordered like they are defined inside the ul?
[09:57:31] <mil2571> duch_kazatel I'm using ajax.error to handler the 500, is there an exception I need to catch?
[09:57:51] <Tingle2> (#user-messages-index-list is a ul)
[09:58:03] <duch_kazatel> Tingle2 not necessarily.  the array-like object will be ordered however the DOM ordered them, which should be the same order as visually.
[09:58:12] <duch_kazatel> mil2571 there shouldn't be.
[09:58:35] <mil2571> duch_kazatel ok, thanks for the help :)
[09:59:44] <d0de> eugh, it works in the fiddle and not in my code :(
[09:59:50] <Tingle2> and how do I read that list as an array so I can iterate over it?
[10:00:21] <duch_kazatel> Tingle2 it basically IS one.  you can use .each() or, even better, a for loop.
[10:00:31] <duch_kazatel> $('selector')[0] works.
[10:00:39] <Tingle2> you said each() wont go through it in order
[10:00:41] <Tingle2> I need order
[10:00:44] <Tingle2> the dom order
[10:01:10] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel .eq(0) (for jQuery object)   .get(0) for domElement
[10:01:13] <duch_kazatel> huh?  no.  i said there's no way to guarantee order on any object unless it's an array.
[10:01:20] <duch_kazatel> the jquery element is an array-like object.
[10:01:37] <duch_kazatel> you can safely iterate and be relatively sure it's going to be in the same order it appears on the page.
[10:01:46] <duch_kazatel> and BinaryKitten sure - but for loops are fast :)
[10:01:58] <Tingle2> mm ok thanks
[10:02:01] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel yes... for + those
[10:02:14] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't use eq or get.
[10:02:18] <BinaryKitten> .eq(i)   . get(i) etc ... over [i]
[10:02:29] <duch_kazatel> there a speed test for that?
[10:07:00] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I worked out the problem. The addClass element was inside the parent removeClass element, so the class was being added then instantly removed again. I didn't realize that click() triggered twice, once on mousedown and once on mouseup
[10:07:21] <duch_kazatel> d0de .click only runs once I thought.
[10:07:24] <mil2571> duch_kazatel ah, figured it out. My request are queued and I was not getting the next request on errors like I was on successes.
[10:07:40] <d0de> duch_kazatel, well changing the parent to mousedown() and the child to mouseup() fixes the problem
[10:07:43] <duch_kazatel> d0de yeah it only runs once.
[10:07:45] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[10:08:06] <duch_kazatel> "The click event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is pressed and released."
[10:08:18] <d0de> ok
[10:08:32] <d0de> how can I destroy the click handler once I'm done with it?
[10:09:01] <duch_kazatel> .off()
[10:09:12] <duch_kazatel> I'd use .on() and .off() as needed.  there's also .one()
[10:09:41] <duch_kazatel> but needing to add/remove handlers like that is usually not necessary.
[10:10:23] <d0de> duch_kazatel, you're right, .off() and .on() work perfectly, thanks very much
[10:10:36] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel: there is a speed tests for it now: http://jsperf.com/get-eq-arraylike
[10:11:04] <duch_kazatel> d0de .one() also binds the event handler once and removes it after a single run.
[10:11:07] <BinaryKitten> though the "beautify code" button submits the perf
[10:11:19] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten you're forgetting my favorite way to do that :)
[10:11:42] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel are you sure?
[10:11:46] <duch_kazatel> yup
[10:11:54] <BinaryKitten> reload
[10:12:01] <BinaryKitten> might have been in edit..
[10:12:08] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:12:12] <BillCriswell> Pretty damn close.
[10:12:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsperf.com/get-eq-arraylike/2 has it.
[10:12:31] <BinaryKitten> heh
[10:12:49] <BinaryKitten> for sheer element Access
[10:12:54] <BinaryKitten> array like = fasted
[10:12:58] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[10:13:02] <duch_kazatel> that's why I prefer it.
[10:13:25] <BinaryKitten> that's for just element access though
[10:13:33] <BinaryKitten> not actually doing anything with the element
[10:13:47] <BinaryKitten> if we were to update the text for example
[10:14:53] <BillCriswell> Isn't myListItems(i) making it a jQuery object?
[10:15:00] <BillCriswell> Isn't myListItems.eq(i) making it a jQuery object?  **
[10:15:10] <duch_kazatel> that's why I changed my version to make it fair.
[10:15:13] <duch_kazatel> and interesting.
[10:15:33] <decx> the gains look negligible to me
[10:15:34] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel invalid test though
[10:15:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Toadilly.
[10:16:36] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel http://jsperf.com/get-eq-arraylike/3 = all the same
[10:17:09] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten console.log($(myListItems.get(i))); shouldn't be necessary.  doesn't .get() return the jquery object?
[10:17:19] <BinaryKitten> duch no
[10:17:24] <BinaryKitten> .get returns domElement
[10:17:33] <BinaryKitten> .eq returns jquery
[10:17:45] <BillCriswell> Sweet I was understanding right.
[10:17:49] <BillCriswell> I always doubt myself.
[10:17:57] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell :)
[10:18:04] <BinaryKitten> still interesting
[10:18:12] <BinaryKitten> AND still pretty pointless lol
[10:18:22] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/get/ woahdang.
[10:18:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah, this is 5 minutes I'll never get back.
[10:18:37] <duch_kazatel> "Each jQuery object also masquerades as an array, so we can use the array dereferencing operator to get at the list item instead:"
[10:18:39] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:18:57] <duch_kazatel> .get is basically a convenience method.
[10:19:11] <BinaryKitten> but with extra bang
[10:19:14] <BinaryKitten> like negatives
[10:19:18] <BillCriswell> Yes, it allows you to do like .get(-1)
[10:19:21] <duch_kazatel> i don't like that.
[10:19:23] <duch_kazatel> personally.
[10:19:49] <BinaryKitten> $(items[items.length -1]) for you duch_kazatel ?
[10:20:19] <BillCriswell> $('li').slice(-1) for me!
[10:20:43] <duch_kazatel> why would I need a negative index?
[10:21:26] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel get the last item without using :last
[10:25:31] <duch_kazatel> meh, I'm fine doing  $(items)[itemsLength - 1] when I need to.
[10:25:34] <duch_kazatel> but I'm weird.
[10:26:06] <duch_kazatel> partially because I have do deal with things like this all the time: jsperf.com/regexp-vs-indexof/103
[10:26:45] <jita> I have markup of li node, I want to wrap it inside a ul, whats the best way to do it ?
[10:27:17] <duch_kazatel> jita is the UL all ready on the page?
[10:28:24] <jita> duch_kazatel: no, i have a conditional. Is it is true I want to wrap li inside <ul class='children'> otherwise dont append it
[10:30:01] <jita> currently i am doing something like this
[10:30:03] <jita> (data.is_child === true ? '<ul class="children">': '') + '<li data-comment_id="' + data.pk + '">' +
[10:30:15] <jita> but i have to check for closing ul too in this
[10:31:58] <BillCriswell> jita: There's wrap and wrapAll.
[10:32:40] <BillCriswell> jita: http://jsbin.com/woyuwiwe/1/edit?html,css,js,output something like this?
[10:33:30] <duch_kazatel> jita you can also do $('<ul class=""></ul>').append('<li data-comment_id="' + data.pk + '">');
[10:36:42] <d0de> there are loads of places in my code where I have a long list of the same elements being fed into a function. Is there a way to condense the code using an array or something? http://jsfiddle.net/zk7un/1/
[10:37:05] <d0de> the same elements being fed into different functions, I mean
[10:37:53] <BillCriswell> You can put them into an array and play each as you loop.
[10:38:24] <d0de> BillCriswell, do you know of any example code you could link me to? I'm very new at this
[10:39:56] <BillCriswell> d0de: var sounds = [ humansglueplayer0, humansglueplayer1, humansglueplayer2, humansglueplayer3 ]; function playAll() { for( var i = 0, l = sounds.length; i < l; i++ ) { sounds[i].play(); } }
[10:39:57] <jita> Thanks duch_kazatel and BillCriswell, much appreciated
[10:40:04] <BillCriswell> jita: No problem!
[10:40:47] <BillCriswell> If you're using underscore there's _.invoke( sounds, 'play' );, _.invoke( sounds, 'pause' );
[10:41:03] <d0de> BillCriswell, thanks very much, that's extremely helpful
[10:41:52] <BillCriswell> d0de: No problem!
[10:51:47] <ShawnRisk> jedimind: hi
[10:52:40] <eeprom> hello all
[10:53:14] <ShawnRisk> hi
[10:53:28] <eeprom> anyone know why i am getting there error that "domReady is null or is not an object" in IE7 with jquery 1.7.2 and bootstrap 2.3.2
[10:53:45] <eeprom> besides the obvious point that i'm crazy enough to be trying to support IE7, of course :)
[10:56:24] <duch_kazatel> eeprom do you have any other code on the page?
[10:56:41] <Toerkeium> hello guys

[10:57:01] <ShawnRisk> hi duch_kazatel
[10:57:15] <duch_kazatel> hey ShawnRisk
[10:57:23] <ShawnRisk> eeprom: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4167204/javascript-redirect-causing-ie-null-is-null-or-not-an-object-error
[10:57:28] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: can I pm you?
[10:57:32] <Toerkeium> I think it should at least alert the id of "this" element, no?
[10:57:34] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk sure.
[10:58:32] <duch_kazatel> Toerkeium do you have a more complete example you could toss up on jsfiddle?
[10:58:58] <Toerkeium> duch_kazatel: let me put it there, thank you
[11:04:38] <Toerkeium> duch_kazatel: I can't make the javascript confirm() extend to work on jsfiddle to make the example :/
[11:06:48] <duch_kazatel> Toerkeium is it a plugin?
[11:06:56] <duch_kazatel> if so, include it in the external resources on the left.
[11:12:34] <hooliogan132> can any one  recommend a touch friendly zoom lens code
[11:15:51] <vanseverk> Anyone here who uses http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js ?
[11:16:04] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, whats the best input mask plugin out there? I've been using some, but they have some issues with ie9.
[11:19:12] <jphase> rgoytacaz: I typically used digital brush's "Masked Input Plugin" although it doesn't always play nicely with "others".
[11:19:37] <jphase> I also like this one if all I need is date/time stuffs: http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[11:21:29] <ShawnRisk> hi jphase
[11:21:35] <jphase> hi ShawnRisk
[11:21:41] <ShawnRisk> how are you?
[11:21:54] <jphase> meh, a bit overwhelmed on this project, but doing swell, how about yourself?
[11:22:34] <ShawnRisk> jphase: confused on one piece of a project not sure what to do.  Need any help?
[11:23:09] <jphase> oh this is for work, it'd be morally inappropriate to get help on it hehe, but thx :)
[11:23:23] <rgoytacaz> jphase: I see, I've used that, it has a few bugs with IE. =/
[11:23:54] <jphase> rgoytacaz: yeah, a lot of things do unfortunately. I'm not much of an expert on masking plugins that fix IEs shortcomings unfortunately
[11:23:57] <ShawnRisk> jphase: you're welcome.  My problem is just crazy
[11:24:09] <jphase> ShawnRisk: what's the problem?
[11:24:20] <ShawnRisk> jphase: pm?
[11:24:27] <jphase> sure
[11:24:38] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk why can't you just put it out to the channel?
[11:24:47] <duch_kazatel> asking everybody might get you the help you're looking for.
[11:24:52] <duch_kazatel> plus others can learn from it :)
[11:24:59] <ShawnRisk> okay
[11:25:00] <rgoytacaz> jphase: thank you, sir.
[11:25:08] <duch_kazatel> just a suggestion :)
[11:25:24] <jphase> yeah, if it's on-topic, paste here for sure
[11:25:34] <ShawnRisk> on plushinteractive.ca in the portfolio part, if you click the second image this is suppose to go to espresso store website but doesn't.  How do I fix that?
[11:26:22] <jphase> well it scrolls there appropriately for me
[11:26:25] <bkosborne> Is there a specific IRC for jQuery mobile?
[11:26:41] <jphase> bkosborne: this is it
[11:26:47] <bkosborne> jphase: ok
[11:27:19] <bkosborne> All, I'm having a problem where a link to my apps homepage is loaded twice. It only happens if I start the app from a page that isn't the homepage.
[11:27:19] <jphase> ShawnRisk: it scrolls right to espressostore.ca - is that not what it's supposed to do?
[11:27:27] <bkosborne> I explain more here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21859950/jquery-mobile-linking-to-homepage-loads-everything-twice
[11:27:29] <bkosborne> really baffling
[11:27:49] <ShawnRisk> jphase: meaning?
[11:27:57] <duch_kazatel> jphase the problem ShawnRisk is talking about is when you click the espresso store thumbnail - it should open the site.
[11:28:03] <Ownix> In a droppable accept: option how do I say accept everything but X
[11:28:03] <duch_kazatel> right now it doesn't.
[11:28:05] <jphase> ohhh
[11:29:00] <duch_kazatel> my guess is that the div ShawnRisk is inserting over the link is causing issues, and the modal plugin might be preventing the default click event from running.
[11:29:41] <Ericx2x> Hey does anyone know a good plugin that can achieve what this website does with items populating as scrolling occurs?
[11:29:43] <Ericx2x> http://adayinbigdata.com/
[11:30:51] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: it is the plugin and the div?  I took out the div and still wasn't going to the site.
[11:31:07] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk those are my guesses.
[11:31:36] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: oops :P
[11:31:37] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk I'd try disabling one, test.  if that doesn't work, disable the other, test.  if THAT doesn't work, disable both, test.
[11:32:06] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: it is not that easy to disable this from my view
[11:32:10] <ShawnRisk> jphase: any thoughts?
[11:32:17] <jphase> bkosborne: is pageinit actually being called twice?
[11:32:23] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk uh... why not?
[11:33:01] <duch_kazatel> it should be as easy as commenting out code...
[11:33:12] <Toerkeium> duch_kazatel: this is the script: http://jsfiddle.net/P6qkX/3/
[11:33:27] <Toerkeium> I can't get the id of the image
[11:33:30] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I did comment out code and disabled everything I thought I needed to and still nothing.
[11:33:38] <jphase> Ericx2x: that page is not actually loading content as the site scrolls down, it's animating content based on the scroll position
[11:33:43] <Toerkeium> when you press "OK" in the confirm dialog
[11:33:47] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk then you've got some bigger problems.
[11:33:53] <bkosborne> jphase:  it is yes
[11:33:59] <jphase> hm
[11:34:11] <duch_kazatel> Toerkeium that's because $(this) is the window in that context
[11:34:24] <jphase> bkosborne: do you have a data role on your div?
[11:34:26] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: why?
[11:34:35] <jphase> bkosborne: like <div data-role="page"> ?
[11:34:50] <vanseverk> Anyone here who uses twitter's typeahead?
[11:34:51] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk you should know what you're binding where imo.
[11:35:00] <bkosborne> jphase: yea. and with a unique ID for the homepage ("page-dashboard")
[11:35:02] <Toerkeium> duch_kazatel: how could I get the id of the image then?
[11:35:14] <duch_kazatel> Toerkeium this is one way: http://jsfiddle.net/P6qkX/4/
[11:35:15] <jphase> bkosborne: odd indeed
[11:35:45] <jphase> bkosborne: out of curiosity, what version of jQuery are you using?
[11:35:53] <bkosborne> jphase: I just updated to the latest 1.x
[11:35:54] <Toerkeium> damn I tried that before, I guess I did it wrong! thanks duch_kazatel
[11:36:01] <bkosborne> and I'm on JQM 1.4.1 now as well
[11:36:47] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: I didn't create this website so I am trying to figure out where everything is, and there is a lot of code that I think could be shorter.
[11:36:48] <kegster> is there a way to prevent an iframe from changing source? (ie, prevent a link inside the frame from navigating away)
[11:37:39] <jphase> bkosborne: are you using something like modernizr by chance?
[11:37:42] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk ah.  i thought you made the site.
[11:37:45] <bkosborne> jphase: yes I am
[11:38:02] <duch_kazatel> kegster not reliably afaik.  why are you trying to do that?
[11:38:02] <Ericx2x> Hey does anyone know a good plugin that can achieve what this website does with items populating as scrolling occurs? http://adayinbigdata.com/
[11:38:10] <bkosborne> jphase: actually no. I thought I was
[11:38:13] <bkosborne> looks like I'm not
[11:38:39] <alainus> var S = $.someThing <--- What does this actually do ?
[11:38:49] <ShawnRisk> duch_kazatel: if I did, I might know where you are talking about is.
[11:38:54] <duch_kazatel> ShawnRisk fair enough.
[11:39:04] <alainus> (someThing = not a jquery function )
[11:39:09] <jphase> bkosborne: this sounds disgusting to me, but some folks with similar issues are resolving them by putting their js in the head rather than the body (for their doc ready calls and such)
[11:39:10] <duch_kazatel> alainus sets S to the output of $.something
[11:39:29] <duch_kazatel> depending on the scripts, putting them in the head is fine.
[11:39:31] <bkosborne> jphase: the terrible annoying thing about it is that it's only a problem when I start the app off on a page that ISN'T the main page
[11:39:33] <alainus> duch_kazatel, I'm referring to jQuery, in this case, that would return undefined ?
[11:39:34] <duch_kazatel> as long as your judicious about it.
[11:39:34] <ShawnRisk> jphase: do you have any ideas on my question?
[11:39:45] <bkosborne> jphase: all of my scripts are in the head already
[11:39:50] <duch_kazatel> alainus what is $.someThing?
[11:40:12] <alainus> duch_kazatel, something you just invented, such as $.assDonkey
[11:40:28] <alainus> (I'm trying to understand a script)
[11:40:56] <alainus> uikit.js starts with: var UI = $.UIkit || {}
[11:40:57] <duch_kazatel> alainus i have no idea what you're talking about.  $.assDonkey would be the "assDonkey" prop on the jquery object.
[11:41:08] <duch_kazatel> aaaah. there we go.
[11:41:15] <alainus> sorry about the || {}
[11:41:21] <alainus> so basically checks for.... what?
[11:41:22] <duch_kazatel> no, that's important.
[11:41:33] <jphase> bkosborne: I think we've officially hit jphase's end of transmission on debugging JQM. To me it sounds like everything is done properly. I'd start by double checking the other pages all have page roles, no doc ready or init calls are calling the same functions, and if all else fails, literally diff the two to see what the difference is between home and the other pages
[11:41:38] <alainus> (sorry about omitting it before :)
[11:41:47] <duch_kazatel> that checks if UI $.UIkit is defined and, if not, creates a new object.
[11:42:03] <bkosborne> jphase: thanks for your help, I appreciate it
[11:42:08] <jphase> bkosborne: someone else might know about this particular issue but I haven't personally experienced/resolved it :(
[11:42:57] <alainus> duch_kazatel, alright. Is it normal to store something inside the jQuery object like that? (it assigns UI = $.UIkit afterwards)
[11:43:22] <duch_kazatel> alainus it's adding a public jquery method for you.
[11:43:27] <jphase> ShawnRisk: try changing your class from "link" to "fancybox"
[11:44:17] <ShawnRisk> jphase: what will that do?
[11:44:25] <eeprom> duch_kazatel: good call, new relic is inserting some javascript into the <head> tag
[11:44:35] <jphase> ShawnRisk: well, all the others work, and they have a class="fancybox" which I assume is what fancybox is being bound to...
[11:44:47] <jphase> ShawnRisk: so in theory, that should fix the fancybox on that element?
[11:44:50] <duch_kazatel> eeprom what was your question again?
[11:45:11] <duch_kazatel> jphase they want the side to actually open afaik
[11:45:25] <ShawnRisk> not side, site
[11:45:27] <jphase> oic
[11:45:31] <duch_kazatel> err, yeah
[11:45:32] <alainus> duch_kazatel, What could that be for? so that object is permanently accessible?
[11:45:34] <eeprom> duch_kazatel: yeah sorry i left for a sec, I'm trying to use bootstrap 2.3.2 with jquery 1.7.2 in IE7 but i'm getting the error that "domReady is null or not an object"
[11:45:47] <duch_kazatel> alainus to make the method available outside of the function.
[11:45:50] <duch_kazatel> so others can use it.
[11:46:02] <eeprom> but i just took out respond.js and html5shiv.js and now i don't see the error
[11:46:13] <duch_kazatel> eeprom also be aware that old IE sometimes fires off the domReady event before it's actually ready.
[11:46:14] <jphase> ShawnRisk: sorry, just catching up to speed on this, so the links with .link are supposed to open up the site in the current tab or?
[11:46:29] <tucan> could someone write me an example of using getJSON to hit a REST api on the url domain.com/ws/*theword*/*thelang*
[11:46:54] <ShawnRisk> jphase: for now whatever, current tab, new tab, new window.  At this point, I just want the site to open.
[11:46:54] <tucan> the api returns proper json but i dont really get how it's done in jquery part
[11:47:19] <duch_kazatel> bbiab lunch
[11:47:33] <eeprom> duch_lunch: noted, thanks for your help
[11:47:39] <alainus> That's a cool trick. Thanks duch_lunch
[11:48:10] <duch_lunch> alainus not really a trick - go read up on javascript and scoping :)
[11:48:17] <jphase> ShawnRisk: well the click event is firing, so something is clearly removing the event as duch_lunch mentioned earlier
[11:48:21] <duch_lunch> and now I actually leave.
[11:48:42] <ShawnRisk> jphase: yes but what?
[11:49:23] <jphase> ShawnRisk: $('.link').unbind('click').click(function(){ window.location.href = $(this).attr('href'); });
[11:49:27] <jphase> that should do the trick
[11:49:41] <jphase> you can clean that up to be more specific on your selector later
[11:49:45] <ShawnRisk> jphase: where to add that?
[11:49:52] <jphase> somewhere in your js
[11:49:59] <jphase> script.js
[11:50:06] * alainus has read The Definitive Guide and The Good Parts and still doesn't understand some people's code. There's actually much more to js than knowig javascript
[11:50:12] <jphase> (after fancybox somewhere if that doesn't work)
[11:51:09] <ShawnRisk> okay
[11:51:58] <ShawnRisk> jphase: that worked out thanks
[11:52:03] <jphase> np
[11:52:18] <jphase> brb folks, jphase needs beer to function
[11:53:34] <Ericx2x> Hey does anyone know a good jquery plugin that can achieve what this website does with items populating as scrolling occurs? http://adayinbigdata.com/
[11:53:53] <Ericx2x> I remember someone linked me to a github link that could do it but i cant find it anymore
[11:56:20] <tucan> I'm currently looking at http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/ and I'm not sure how params are passed
[11:57:56] <tucan> someone said it's shown in one of the examples but i dont know, which one is it?
[11:58:07] <BillCriswell> jedimind: Have you used singularity grid system?
[11:58:28] <jedimind> nope
[11:58:33] <jedimind> i try to stay away from grid systems
[11:58:49] <jedimind> BillCriswell: sorry
[11:59:11] <BillCriswell> I guess it wasn't you who suggested that grid systems to me after I Said I don't see a point lol
[11:59:44] <BillCriswell> I just watched a video on it and it seems cool, but there's a whole lot to keep track of.
[12:01:49] <jedimind> yeah its just ... an added dependency that handles something that i can slap together in 5 minutes via css anyway
[12:03:52] <BillCriswell> I definitely agree. Before we could use border-box reliably I could understand using one, now I don't.
[12:14:03] <alainus> $("input").get(0)
[12:14:06] <alainus> what does this do ?
[12:14:17] <alainus> .get is documented as an ajax shorthand
[12:16:12] <BillCriswell> alainus: Different get.
[12:16:30] <BillCriswell> .get(0) just grabs the first DOM element that selector matches.
[12:17:05] <BillCriswell> alainus: http://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:17:16] <alainus> Ah, thanks
[12:17:57] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:25:46] <ShooterMG> I'm calling .append('<textarea>hello</textarea>') from within an AJAX callback. This works. But when I then try to select it with $('textarea'), jQuery can't find it. Any ideas?
[12:28:25] <BillCriswell> ShooterMG: If you want the textarea you just added you're need to do $('textarea') after you append it, but what are you trying to do with the text area exactly? Might be able to use event delegation.
[12:28:48] <BillCriswell> s/you're/you'll
[12:29:16] <ShooterMG> BillCriswell, I'm trying to convert it to a rich text editor using an external library (nicEdit)
[12:30:30] <jwmann> How would I clone an element and put the clone directly next to the element I'm cloning
[12:31:00] <BillCriswell> Eh, ok, so you're probably be better off doing this in the callback: .append('<textarea>hello</textarea>'); $('textarea').whatever();
[12:32:08] <BillCriswell> jwmann: $original.after( $clone );
[12:32:25] <BillCriswell> ShooterMG: .whatever() being the plugin name.
[12:32:41] <ShooterMG> right, the problem is that $('textarea') doesn't find anything
[12:32:51] <ShooterMG> even though it's been appended
[12:33:16] <ShooterMG> and i've tried it within firebug, it still can't find the appended textarea, which is plainly visible :P
[12:33:34] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Like this? $('.foobar').clone().after(); ?
[12:33:34] <BillCriswell> ShooterMG: I'd have to see it. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to fidn that textarea.
[12:34:31] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Or $('.foobar').after( $(this).clone() ); ?
[12:35:14] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Can't use this in after. Would need to use a function to call that.
[12:35:31] <BillCriswell> $('.foobar').after(function(){ return $(this).clone() }); should work?
[12:35:43] <jwmann> Not sure the appropriate way to structure it :S
[12:36:56] <BillCriswell> jwmann: http://jsbin.com/yofamite/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:37:40] <BillCriswell> Didn't even need clone haha
[12:38:01] <jwmann> Wow xD
[12:38:17] <fr4nk> m00h, following problem: how to set allowSamePageTransition to true in jquery mobile 1.4 globally ?
[12:38:28] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure if there's something terrible about that I'm not picking up on... but it seems ok.
[12:39:57] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[12:40:40] <BillCriswell> I'm confusing myself.
[12:41:56] <BillCriswell> jwmann: That was is fucked.
[12:41:59] <BillCriswell> That way*
[12:42:19] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/yofamite/2/edit the better way.
[12:42:57] <BillCriswell> It's so strange, the second argument of after() if you pass it a function seems to be the text node of it?
[12:43:59] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Weird.. xD I'll use the second way!
[12:44:23] <BillCriswell> $('.original').after(function(){ return $(this).clone(); }); this way will work, just the first one I sent it bad.
[12:47:50] <BillCriswell> Ah, additional arguments.
[12:50:57] <ericandrewlewis> i'm using _.bind in tandem with $.on
[12:51:31] <ericandrewlewis> since i'm declaring in _.bind the context and the arguments that should be passed through to the callback…how can i also access jQuery's event object in callback scope?
[12:55:46] <ericandrewlewis> i'm also trying $.proxy() to replace _.bind(), but getting the same result.
[12:56:59] <jwmann> Hmmm, how would I take something like this [ 'foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'foo', 'bar' ] and turn it into [ 'foo', 'bar' ] ?
[12:57:40] <bkosborne> jphase: so my problem is related to the tabs widget
[12:57:49] <bkosborne> not the fact that it's the first page
[12:57:54] <bkosborne> your suggestion to "diff" the pages helped
[12:58:10] <bkosborne> I realized that once taking away the tabs widget I didn't have the problem
[12:58:23] <bkosborne> so now I'm trying to figure out why the tabs is causing the freakout :)(
[12:58:59] <jphase> aha! good troubleshooting :D
[12:59:59] <BillCriswell> ericandrewlewis: I'm not super familiar with it but event would be the first argument in the function you're binding too.
[13:00:08] <BillCriswell> ericandrewlewis: http://jsbin.com/corexowu/1/edit?html,js,output like this
[13:00:25] <ericandrewlewis> BillCriswell: yeah, i'm mistaken. I'm also using d3 which has its own .on() method, which is at fault
[13:00:27] <ericandrewlewis> thanks tho
[13:00:44] <BillCriswell> ericandrewlewis: Groovy. No problem.
[13:02:26] <BillCriswell> jwmann: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10191941/jquery-unique-on-an-array-of-strings
[13:06:38] <BillCriswell> jwmann: The jquery isn't really needed but it can make it easier with it's $.inArray()
[13:06:49] <jwmann> BillCriswell: Not really sure what the solution is from that page xD
[13:06:53] <b-lew> is it possible to unwrap a div only if it has a particular class?
[13:07:29] <BillCriswell> b-lew: if( $div.is('.foo')){ $div.unwrap() } of whatever.
[13:07:46] <BillCriswell> or if you have a bunch you can do $divs.filter('.foo').unwrap()
[13:08:04] <jwmann> Ooo the second answer looks promising
[13:08:08] <tucan> http://jsfiddle.net/5bhyK/6/ I'm trying use getJSON to fetch some info from REST service but im not sure whats wrong with this
[13:08:14] <b-lew> ah thanks!
[13:08:16] <tucan> any help would be appreciated
[13:09:23] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Yeah, the one using just filter would be quicker, but I'm not sure on IEs indexOf support on an array in older versions.
[13:10:05] <jwmann> BillCriswell: I just his updated version as the solution
[13:10:07] <BillCriswell> Ugh, IE doesn't have indexOf till 8.
[13:10:13] <BillCriswell> jwmann: Sweet.
[13:10:18] <duch_kazatel> but there's a shim out there for it!
[13:10:22] <jwmann> He replaced indexOf with inArray
[13:10:29] <BillCriswell> till 9 *
[13:10:42] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah, but still... indexOf() is like the most useful thing.
[13:11:36] <duch_kazatel> array.indexOf() can be, yeah.
[13:11:42] <duch_kazatel> 'swhy i dig underscore so much.
[13:12:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Agreed.
[13:12:22] <BillCriswell> My second favorite.
[13:13:11] <BillCriswell> tucan: If you log data is it what ou expect? Is the call successful?
[13:16:53] <BillCriswell> tucan: http://jsfiddle.net/5bhyK/7/ here is a cleaned up fiddle.
[13:17:40] <coderego> Hey guys. Quick question: I am using Jquery to send in a form via ajax. There is a seperate section of the page that I would like to update the value of after the ajax posts. How do I do that?
[13:18:06] <duch_kazatel> coderego in the .done() callback.
[13:18:11] <duch_kazatel> or the .success() callback.
[13:18:22] <tucan> BillCriswell: I tried going to Web console JS tab and it says The Web Console logging API (console.log, console.info, console.warn, console.error) has been disabled by a script on this page.
[13:18:29] <tucan> what does this mean?
[13:22:14] <BillCriswell> tucan: There must be some code disabling it.
[13:22:57] <BillCriswell> Any other scripts on your page?
[13:25:43] <tucan> nope
[13:26:50] <BillCriswell> tucan: I guess tr in another browser lol
[13:29:44] <Tomashe> hey guys there is a way to make few functions like that RunThis().RunThAT() , after runthis return value the second one excute
[13:30:14] <slavsan> Tomashe: just return this in the function call
[13:30:31] <slavsan> it's called method chaining
[13:30:41] <Tomashe> u mean function x() { return y(); }
[13:31:05] <Tomashe> but if i want x to do something and not always return y
[13:32:29] <slavsan> ok, what is exactly what you want, I don't seem to understand
[13:33:39] <slavsan> first of all, the dot notation is for executing methods of an object so obj.runThis().runThat() was the thing I was thinking of initially
[13:34:01] <slavsan> maybe you need function(x, callbackFunction) { if (condition) { callbackFunction();
[13:34:04] <slavsan> maybe you need function(x, callbackFunction) { if (condition) { callbackFunction();
[13:34:24] <slavsan> maybe you need function(x, callbackFunction) { if (condition) { callbackFunction(); } return x; }
[13:34:54] <slavsan> sorry for the multiple entries, typed "enter" by mistake
[13:44:22] <krambiorix> i have an input field with an autocomplete on it. Sometimes the input field has been filled in already... I want jquery to check if the filled in value is in the autocomplete source. But on init i see that the ul is not filled in with values yet.. What can i do?
[13:44:31] <tucan> i think it's just an issue with the cross domain
[13:47:39] <jlucas> krambiorix : value="" autocomplete="off"  This should prevent the form field from being populated when the page loads.
[13:47:43] <slavsan> why don't you just clear the input field on init? Do you want it to be pre-filled?
[13:48:11] <krambiorix> jlucas, slavsan i want it to be pre filled
[13:49:23] <krambiorix> so i want the source to be loaded already
[13:49:38] <tucan> I'm being told that the obvious solution is to eliminate the corss domain nature of the request
[13:49:48] <tucan> not sure what the heck that is
[13:50:01] <tucan> googling
[13:50:08] <tucan> the script is fine as is
[13:50:49] <slavsan> krambiorix: why don't you just check what's in the input and load the sources for this value?
[13:50:52] <jlucas> At least it does for my autocomplete fields
[13:51:15] <jlucas> pre-filled with what?
[13:52:10] <krambiorix> jlucas, my source is an ajax request with values like 'abc', 'aab','aba' ..... the filled in value is 'aab' -> i want to check if it's in my source... But the source is not loaded yet...
[13:52:27] <michaelg> Quick question peeps. When I link Jquery to my head, it disables console.log from working. Why the hell is that?
[13:52:30] <slavsan> krambiorix: I suppose your scenario is as follows: on input change you load with ajax possible results for the typed in word, so on document load sometimes there's something prefilled, why not check if it is and just load the results for it right away?
[13:53:00] <michaelg> I have a js file that only has console.log("Testing testing"); in it
[13:53:16] <michaelg> Which works when it is the only js file linked to the html document
[13:53:24] <michaelg> but when I link Jquery
[13:53:31] <michaelg> That message no longer appears in console
[13:53:34] <michaelg> Any ideas?
[13:54:29] <jlucas> michaelg Does javascript work at all?
[13:55:02] <BillCriswell> tucan: You'd want to do like $.getJSON('someScriptThatRequestsExternalPage.foo', function(response){ });
[13:55:19] <slavsan> michaelg: does it log if you put your script after jquery?
[13:55:30] <michaelg> Lemme check
[13:57:08] <krambiorix> slavsan, you're perfectly right :D
[13:57:19] <slavsan> glad I could help :)
[13:57:35] <BillCriswell> tucan: If you're using PHP it could be like <?php echo file_get_content('http://someexternalwebsite/foo/$foo'); ?> then you request that page in your request.
[13:57:49] <michaelg> slavsan: It already is after it.
[13:57:59] <michaelg> And it now works?
[13:58:02] <michaelg> WTH
[13:58:09] <michaelg> That's confusing
[13:58:17] <martisj> monring
[13:58:21] <martisj> *morning
[13:58:30] <slavsan> maybe jquery is doing console.clear() but I doubt it
[13:58:41] <martisj> How can i use the same function as event handler for multiple elements?
[13:58:49] <slavsan> anyway usually you would want to load jquery first and then your thing
[13:59:07] <martisj> I have two classes, '.icon' and '.user_profile_picture'
[13:59:10] <duch_kazatel> martisj depends - do they all share a common parent?
[13:59:19] <martisj> duch_kazatel: document :)
[13:59:24] <duch_kazatel> other than document?
[13:59:28] <martisj> no
[13:59:33] <martisj> well i guess #wrapper
[13:59:42] <michaelg> slavsan: Now I'm testing this bit of code, which isn't showing up in console... And I don't know why, as I believe it should...
[13:59:43] <martisj> i am not guessing
[13:59:44] <michaelg> $('div').each( function (index) { 	console.log(index); });
[13:59:57] <martisj> they do have a common parent
[14:00:11] <duch_kazatel> then do something like $('#wrapper').on('click', '.icon, .user_profile_picture', function(){});
[14:00:14] <slavsan> I see an "I" infront of the console.log
[14:00:19] <slavsan> what is that?
[14:00:30] <martisj> ok just a comma is fine duch_kazatel  ?
[14:00:41] <duch_kazatel> martisj yeah.  it's a selector.
[14:00:42] <michaelg> slavsan: Where?
[14:01:05] <slavsan> michaelg: $('div').each( function (index) { Iconsole.log(index); });
[14:01:31] <michaelg> slavsan: Maybe it's not working as I'm not firing that function when the document is ready?
[14:01:32] <slavsan> micahelg: it looks like some special symbol or something?
[14:01:42] <michaelg> Tab?
[14:01:56] <slavsan> michaelg: dunno, just backspace before console.log
[14:02:02] <michaelg> $('div').each( function (index) {     console.log(index); });  console.log("testing console");
[14:02:14] <michaelg> slavsan: How about that?
[14:02:24] <slavsan> micahelg: and actually console.log should always be loaded, it's part of the window object
[14:02:27] <martisj> duch_kazatel: cool beans bru
[14:02:59] <michaelg> slavsan: But maybe when jquery tries to do each on the divs, they don't exist yet?
[14:03:35] <slavsan> michaelg: probably, try with $(document).ready(function() {    ... your code here ...      });
[14:04:45] <michaelg> slavsan: trying that now
[14:06:19] <michaelg> slavsan: TIGHT. That works!
[14:06:28] <michaelg> slavsan: YAY!'
[14:06:46] <michaelg> slavsan: Thanks dude. I knew it was something stupid like that.
[14:06:59] <slavsan> michaelg: no worries :)
[14:07:39] <michaelg> slavsan: Back to kicking some ass!
[14:07:48] <michaelg> slavsan: Thanks again!
[14:57:26] <ankurk_> What might be the cause of the up & down arrow buttons not working in this jsbin? http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/5/edit
[15:01:27] <shoky> ankurk_:  they do work
[15:01:37] <shoky> you're just sorting ascending with both buttons
[15:02:15] <ankurk_> Shoky: oh yeah, but both work only once :(
[15:02:21] <ankurk_> Any reason why?
[15:02:31] <ankurk_> mean, why it might be like that?
[15:03:17] <shoky> ankurk_  http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/7/edit
[15:03:31] <shoky> ankurk_  because you need to change sortDir
[15:03:51] <shoky> actually i don't like what i just did
[15:04:09] <ankurk_> why?
[15:04:45] <shoky> well it's ok , but cause i'm re-creating the sort function on each click
[15:05:06] <ankurk_> ahh okay
[15:05:15] <ankurk_> you're a life saver man :D
[15:05:24] <shoky> better  http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/8/edit
[15:08:13] <ankurk_> Thanks man! :D
[15:09:05] <shoky> shure thang
[15:37:03] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/308314
[15:47:32] <crash1hd> is there a way to do something like this $("tbody (tr.row or tr.row_alt) td");  where the tr has 2 classes but if there was a 3rd class it wouldnt touch that one?
[15:48:22] <jphase> crash1hd: $('tbody tr.row td, tbody tr.row_alt td')
[15:48:39] <jphase> oh, not sure if I understand the last part of that question
[15:49:01] <crash1hd> jphase, I think thats exactly what I was looking for
[16:00:46] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/308314
[16:03:06] <duch_kazatel> fuse405 what do you need?
[16:07:18] <wunz> duch_kazatel: as per his paste: "I am trying to pass the value of $gad1 back to index.php after Ajax call."
[16:08:34] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* I can read that.  but I’m also seeing things lke <div class="content" onload=cl1(); OnClick=cl1(this.className);>
[16:08:37] <duch_kazatel> which is a bad idea.
[16:09:06] <shoky> maybe he wants  $('#Answer').text()    though could be a million other things
[16:09:43] <shoky> oh just noticed he's already sending data in the ajax, nvm
[16:10:11] <shoky> hm whatever  {action:onclick} means, anyway ;S
[16:10:51] <shoky> also what happend to <body>  :(
[16:12:05] <shoky> oh my $gad
[16:12:48] <duch_kazatel> e$gad
[16:27:49] <KWhat_Work> How would I go about adding a new function to some $.namespace.mynewfunc() ?
[16:28:12] <duch_kazatel> $.namespace.mynewfunc = function(){}; is one way.
[16:28:26] <ryanneufeld> KWhat_Work: ^^ that's pretty much it
[16:28:43] <KWhat_Work> so no .extend .fn.extend?
[16:28:54] <duch_kazatel> don’t necessarily need to.
[16:29:52] <duch_kazatel> extend is when you’re trying to merge object.  you’re just trying to add a new property.
[17:42:16] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[17:42:34] <Starcraftmazter> is it possible to apply hover properties for an item to that item, just at will (ie. if its not being hovered over)
[17:44:40] <bijoo_> Hi, what's good alternate to turn.js? Looks like version 4 is license-only; I'd like to use zoom functionality.
[17:46:30] <duch_kazatel> Starcraftmazter sure - use .trigger(‘hover’);
[19:41:56] <nights> hi
[19:42:11] <nights> not sure where to ask, but testing my website from some devices on my local lan
[19:42:23] <nights> and all requests are dead slow
[19:42:49] <Jattenalle> do you use mysql nights?
[19:43:11] <nights> yes
[19:43:26] <nights> but my college just setup another version of the site on his machine on the same lan
[19:43:27] <nights> and thats fast
[19:43:27] <Jattenalle> try changing the mysql from "localhost" to "127.0.0.1"
[19:43:33] <nights> i've done that
[19:43:36] <nights> ah
[19:43:38] <nights> mysql...
[19:43:55] <nights> was thinking apache, just changed to:
[19:43:56] <nights> ServerName 192.168.1.10:80
[19:43:57] <Jattenalle> using "localhost" sometimes makes it do a stupid DNS lookup that takes a few seconds
[19:43:58] <nights> let me change mysql
[19:44:02] <nights> yeah
[19:44:10] <nights> thats exactly what i believe is the problem
[19:44:18] <nights> some stupid localhost dns lookup
[19:44:27] <Jattenalle> yeah just change it in your php, or whathaveyou
[19:44:29] <nights> i checked the requests in chrome dev panel
[19:44:37] <nights> and the requests take 10 sec before they even start
[19:44:54] <nights> so im not sure it could be mysql related
[19:45:05] <nights> anyway
[19:45:07] <nights> let me change that
[19:45:50] <nights> dont have 'localhost' in my my.ini
[19:45:57] <nights> im guessing its apache
[19:46:09] <nights> or maybe the router
[19:46:12] <Jattenalle> no no, in your website code
[19:46:17] <nights> ah
[19:46:23] <Jattenalle> where you connect to the mysql
[19:46:25] <nights> then im sure im not suing localhost
[19:46:34] <nights> the mysql server is on another computer actually
[19:46:37] <Jattenalle> hm, then i dont know.. weird firewall?
[19:46:45] <nights> windows 7
[19:48:49] <nights> interesting
[19:48:56] <nights> if i try the site from the server hosting mysql
[19:48:59] <nights> its fast
[19:51:30] <nights> so probably not windows 7 firewall problems
[19:51:36] <nights> although...that machine is windows,too
[19:52:00] <nights> let me test another windows computer and see if thats fast, too
[19:52:27] <nights> guess i will continue this investigation log offline
[20:21:54] <scathen^C> hey all. anyone able to help. I need to find all strings within a webpage that match a particular regex. How would I do that with jquery?
[20:32:29] <jphase> scathen^C: I started writing this as a port from my node scraper that does this very thing:  https://gist.github.com/jphase/8288780
[20:37:52] <jphase> scathen^C: working example:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/VqvLV/
[20:52:20] <scathen^C> jphase: cheers
[20:53:00] <scathen^C> my problem is a little different now. I am trying to figure out a way of getting any youtube video urls/ids from a page.
[20:53:33] <jphase> well that's much easier than using a crazy regex matcher like that
[20:54:19] <jphase> I mean, you could use that and it'll work just fine, up to you to get that crazy
[20:54:27] <scathen^C> fair enough. whats a better way?
[20:55:43] <jphase> well hmm
[20:56:50] <BillCriswell> $('a[href*=youtube.com]') ?
[20:57:04] <sammych> hay all
[20:57:16] <BillCriswell> Eh, bed time.
[20:57:29] <scathen^C> BillCriswell: that will grab links only though right?
[20:57:30] <sammych> is there somewhere I can grab a jQuery UI.css that uses only datauri's for images?
[21:28:16] <rosslazer> Hello I am having trouble combining two canvasses into a single image. It works on every platform but IOS Safari. Are there any jquery/JS nuances on IOS?
[21:28:30] <hendry> how do I only add clicked to the div i pressed the button in here? http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/3/
[21:30:43] <jim_j> hi
[21:31:09] <shoky> hendry: http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/5/
[21:31:51] <shoky> hendry: oops i mean http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/6/
[21:32:14] <shoky> that or .closest('.foo').find('.clicked')
[21:33:55] <hendry> shoky: thanks!
[21:34:37] <aro> has anyone ever seen in firefox when posting a form, getting '407 Proxy Authentication Required'
[21:35:44] <hendry> shoky: is this the correct way to pass around this? http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/7/
[21:36:48] <shoky> hendry: that's fine yeah
[21:37:14] <hendry> shoky: is it good style? wondering whether i could pass just this and the jquerify it later
[21:37:44] <shoky> mm no it's not really common to wrap as you're passing it
[21:38:11] <shoky> passing and jquerifying later is more common, also you can: http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/8/
[21:38:56] <shoky> aro: you're getting that only in firefox?
[21:56:30] <hendry> shoky: don't understand how to get http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/11/ working, when the ul is outside the form in this case
[22:00:41] <jphase> scathen^C: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/VqvLV/3/ - open up the console
[22:01:19] <jphase> may need some crazier regex than that but that was the best I could do this late, brb
[22:12:37] <hendry> can't figure out what is the opposite of siblings, since parents doesn't work here http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/11/
[22:17:52] <bashusr> how do you set a "constant" argument to a function you are making up? Say that you have the variable foo="John" and you want to create a function like myFunc = function() { alert( foo + " was here") }, how would you go about that?
[22:18:12] <bashusr> i'm running into the issue that foo changes by the time i call myFunc()
[22:25:53] <Siecje> I'm trying to use tablesorter on a table but I can't get it to work http://jsfiddle.net/sY3bq/
[22:26:50] <Siecje> I was able to get it to work on another table no problem, maybe because there are input tags?
[22:35:25] <shoky> hendry: $(this).closest('div').find('.clicked')    better if those divs had a class you could use for .closest
[22:38:09] <tw2113> Siecje, $(...).datepicker is not a function
[22:38:42] <Siecje> tw2113: I'm using a plugin, the reason was that I didn't have <th>
[22:39:07] <tw2113> ok
[22:43:56] <hendry> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/13/ doesn't work. Maybe it's better is I chain the click somehow on every div and pass the this down to the click function?
[22:52:35] <shoky> hendry: dude, you still need the prepend...
[22:53:08] <shoky> don't just copy & paste mindlessly
[22:53:24] <hendry> shoky: sorry
[22:53:28] <hendry> shoky: now it works.
[22:54:13] <hendry> shoky: but.. can it be structured better I wonder? http://jsfiddle.net/T3Q79/14/
[22:54:45] <hendry> is there a way to avoid the e.preventDefault(); line I wonder too
[23:00:07] <tw2113> that would allow the user to follow through with the default click action, if you remove
[23:45:45] <shoky> hendry: you can put type="button" on your buttons instead
[23:46:06] <shoky> <button type="button">
[23:46:21] <tw2113> stop talking crazy shoky :P
[23:46:25] <tw2113> that's buttonception
[23:46:48] <shoky> browsers are into it :\
[23:46:57] <tw2113> dem whores!
[23:47:36] <Demerzel> hello folks!
[23:48:32] <Demerzel> I've been trying to google this for a while but no luck so far:  Is there a way to get back the raw Element from a JQuery object?  e.g. $('#myid').raw_element() or something like that?
[23:48:51] <shoky> $('#myid')[0]
[23:48:54] <Demerzel> $('#myid').get(0) returns back a string but not the kind of object that e.g. getElementById() would return
[23:48:54] <tw2113> raw element?
[23:49:10] <tw2113> why not just use getElementById() ?
[23:49:14] <shoky> it shouldn't be returning a string
[23:49:34] <tw2113> i won't look down on you for using vanilla js
[23:49:41] <Demerzel> heh
[23:49:53] <pom_life> jQuery way to draw shapes over mouse pointer location? Having a tough time phrasing this one for google
[23:50:01] <Demerzel> nm i don't know why I didn't check this earlier
[23:50:09] <Demerzel> but getElementById is returning the same thing
[23:50:22] <Demerzel> i... i feel sheepish
[23:50:24] <Demerzel> my baaaaad
