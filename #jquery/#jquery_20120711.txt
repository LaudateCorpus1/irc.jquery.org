[00:31:03] <Pallet> morning all
[00:31:20] <Pallet> does anyone here use or know of flexgrid ?
[00:36:44] <Pallet> 			$(".grid1").click(function() {
[00:36:45] <Pallet> 				var rowid = $(this).attr('id');
[00:36:50] <Pallet> ah, sorry
[00:38:29] <Pallet> If I have a table that is <tr id="t3"><TD>t3</TD><TD>Arsenal</TD></tr>
[00:38:58] <Pallet> I need a click function that can retrieve the tr id
[00:39:15] <Pallet> and I'm trying var rowid = $(this).attr('id');
[00:39:23] <Pallet> but that's not helping
[00:39:28] <Pallet> am I being a muppet?
[00:42:56] <huglester> guys... how do I do this part? $(".acc_overview_box li").not('.is_mobile').hover( ...
[00:42:56] <huglester> I need to catch only .acc_overview_box whichi does not have class '.is_mobile' > li
[00:42:56] <ravenzz> Pallet that should be fine
[00:44:29] <ravenzz> also you can just say this.id
[00:52:51] <varnie> Hello.
[00:53:11] <varnie> why doesn't javascript see my onchange handler binded using jquery?
[00:53:18] <varnie> here's the code sample: http://jsfiddle.net/dA9tS/1/
[00:56:14] <Pallet> ravenzz, alert("Edit row " + this.id); is simply giving me the table id
[00:56:28] <Pallet> not the selected row
[01:01:55] <timing> Hi guys!
[01:02:07] <timing> Running this benchmark here: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/s7rN4/
[01:02:11] <timing> you should open your console log
[01:02:54] <timing> does anyone know why the "body div div div" is so slow with the none queryselectall selectors?
[01:03:14] <timing> I'm testing in chrome. I would expect sizzle to always call queryselectall if supported?
[01:19:02] <Eising> hey there. I need a bit of guidance on how to handle users pressing the browser back button. The elements I dynamically add to the site obviously disappears, is there any way around this?
[01:19:45] <raj> where are the big boys tonight?
[01:20:19] <raj> Eising, you can try using hash's
[01:20:24] <raj> for newer browsers
[01:20:29] <raj> *hashes
[01:20:47] <raj> ?!g javascript hash history
[01:20:51] <raj> !g javascript hash history

[01:21:21] <raj> that'll do
[01:56:47] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/jFMrE/3/ this code in chrome on local server is throwing an error: Uncaught Error: INDEX_SIZE_ERR: DOM Exception 1 , on the getImataData line
[01:56:49] <nFFF> and ideas
[02:09:49] <nlogax> nFFF: You√§re not waiting for the image to load, could that be the problem_
[02:12:57] <nlogax> Also I think there are same origin-ish restrictions for data put into canvas
[02:13:04] <nlogax> That you might hit later
[02:15:12] <nFFF> nlogax this code is on my server
[02:15:17] <nFFF> so same origin doesnt exist
[02:15:20] <nFFF> so is the image
[02:18:54] <Luffha> hi guys....if i have a dropdown list select, with multi select....how can i limit the multi select elements to say:4 ?
[02:18:58] <nlogax> nFFF: Ok. So does it help if you wait for the image's `load` event, and then try to read it into canvas?
[02:22:58] <varnie> anyone, please help me with this simple question: http://jsfiddle.net/dA9tS/2/
[02:23:27] <varnie> why js doesn't  see my jquery change handler?
[02:23:57] <nlogax> varnie: You added it using jQuery, and it does not use the `on<event>` attributes
[02:24:13] <varnie> is there any way to make them friends?
[02:24:25] <nlogax> varnie: If you look at event handlers added by the standard addEventListener (or addEvent in IE), you will see them
[02:24:37] <nFFF> nlogax http://jsfiddle.net/jFMrE/5/
[02:25:42] <nlogax> nFFF: Yeah, that's the origin thing. I don't recall how to make that less painful during development, I think there's a Chrome flag (if you are using that)
[02:26:15] <nFFF> Yea using Chrome
[02:26:22] <nFFF> But nlogax what origin thing
[02:26:29] <nFFF> everythign is local to my computer :|
[02:26:35] <varnie> nlogax, how can I check whether or not jquery change handler has been set (from plain javascript side)?
[02:26:38] <varnie> thanks a lot.
[02:27:11] <varnie> 'if there is jquery change handler, call it'. here is what js should do.
[02:27:19] <nlogax> nFFF: Are you loading a file from file:// ... or something, and running a server on 127.0.0.1 ?
[02:28:02] <nFFF> running a server from 127.0.0.1 and loading file from 127.0.0.1/herp/derp/img.png
[02:28:29] <nFFF> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8688600/context-getimagedata-on-localhost
[02:28:33] <nFFF> perhaps this is why
[02:28:55] <nFFF> wait
[02:28:57] <nFFF> fuark
[02:29:15] <nFFF> my bad, was loading server on http://localhost not http://127.0.0.1
[02:29:18] <nFFF> thanks nlogax
[02:29:27] <nlogax> varnie: Yeah, jQuery keeps track of them somewhere, lemme check
[02:29:32] <nlogax> nFFF: np, glad you found it
[02:29:34] <nlogax> :)
[02:30:09] <serve> is it possible to create a new div in jquery i cant seem to find anything on how to do that other than append("<div></div>")
[02:30:21] <nFFF> nlogax ok next issues, id now contains ImageData, I need to check which pixels are transparent :D
[02:30:29] <nlogax> serve: $("<div/>")
[02:30:48] <nlogax> nFFF: Oh, on your own there, haven't used canvas for anything cool :)
[02:30:53] <serve> thanks
[02:32:20] <nFFF> nlogax http://jsfiddle.net/jFMrE/6/ if you look at last commented out line of code, thats suppose to find the alpha values
[02:32:27] <nFFF> does it make any sense to you cos it doesnt to me
[02:33:08] <nFFF> Or maybe it does make sense
[02:33:35] <nlogax> varnie: OK looks like jQUery uses its own data() stuff to store the handlers. http://i.imgur.com/IN0FL.png
[02:33:48] <varnie> yeah, I found it as well: console.log($('select[name="p[1][birthdayy]"]').data('events')['change']);
[02:33:55] <varnie> thank you, nlogax
[02:34:20] <nlogax> varnie: Note also that you can see them in the debugger, the right column in my screenshot
[02:34:33] <nlogax> varnie: With some handy info attached :)
[02:35:41] <e-anima> i just want tto get the value of the last focused element. how do i do the part "last focused element"? any tips? what event is that
[02:35:56] <e-anima> just plaing with bookmarklets
[02:36:21] <nlogax> nFFF: Oh, so it's just packed into sequences of 4 items all in an array?
[02:38:01] <nlogax> nFFF: In that case that makes sense.. it contains like [r,g,b,a,     r,g,b,a,    r,g,b,a,    etc ]
[02:39:09] <nlogax> nFFF: So the commented out code is looking for 'r' of a pixel at a specific point, then adds 3 to get to 'a' for that pixel
[02:39:21] <nlogax> As far as I can tell anyway
[02:41:22] <nFFF> Ok but why y*width+x?
[02:42:11] <nlogax> In the code that snippet came from, I would guess it has two vars, x and y, representing the point of interest
[02:43:34] <nlogax> Say y = 3, then y*width would get you three rows of pixels into the image. Then +x to move on the x axis
[02:44:07] <nlogax> Makes sense?
[02:44:18] <e-anima> hm. how could i get the #id of the element i clicked.
[02:44:22] <wathek> Hi everybody
[02:44:27] <nlogax> e-anima: this.id
[02:45:24] <nFFF> nlogax, but what is the width variable?
[02:45:24] <wathek> how can I make new added elements draggable ?
[02:45:47] <e-anima> so just inside: jQuery(document).ready(function() {
[02:46:05] <nlogax> nFFF: The width of the image
[02:46:49] <nFFF> ok so the image is 200px wide
[02:47:04] <nFFF> 3*200+1 (first row of pixels)
[02:47:18] <nFFF> thats 600 on the y axis
[02:47:21] <nFFF> which is off the picture
[02:47:31] <e-anima> nlogax the problem i have is the function around this, because when i use this i get the WIndow of course
[02:47:55] <e-anima> and i can not do $('#myid').click ... becaus ei dont know the id yet
[02:49:35] <nlogax> e-anima: Could you show your code somewhere?
[02:49:42] <e-anima> yep, one sec
[02:50:28] <e-anima> http://pastebin.com/S4S8RGm0
[02:50:53] <e-anima> very very simple. this would trigger on input elements, but now just say i want to trigger it on ANY element. thats my problem
[02:50:55] <nFFF> nlogax, as expected its undefined :<
[02:51:04] <nFFF> y*imd.width jsut doesnt make sense to me
[02:51:11] <nlogax> nFFF: Hang on, trying to make a really nice drawing:D
[02:52:14] <nlogax> Lack of drawing skills slowing down somewhat
[02:52:28] <nFFF> :D
[02:54:01] <nFFF> Ok got it working
[02:54:11] <nFFF> IT was due to decimal places in the x,y mouse co-ords
[02:54:13] <nlogax> AWW but the image is so pretty
[02:54:14] <nFFF> Math.round fixed it
[02:55:03] <Farid> Hi there
[02:55:18] <nFFF> fuarking cool got it
[02:56:07] <e-anima> nlogax i guess its an easy on to do that.
[02:56:17] <Farid> I have a question, I am creating a few form fields using jquery, how can i get those form fields data when i submit the form.. i am using php .... any suggestions
[02:58:29] <nlogax> e-anima: For that, it is easier (and way more efficient in the case of *every element*) to use event delegation. That is, put a listener on <body> or <html>, all clicks bubble up to it anyway. When it is triggered, the event object should hold the target
[02:59:08] <nlogax> e-anima: like $("body").click(function(e) { console.log(e.target); }) . Maybe the "live" stuff in jQuery can helpt too, haven't tried.
[03:03:23] <Farid> I am creating a few form fields using jquery, how can i get those form fields data when i submit the form.. i am using php .... any suggestions
[03:08:42] <e-anima> nlogax thx, thats help enough to get the direction. thx
[03:08:50] <nlogax> e-anima: Awesome :)
[03:19:07] <GreekFreak> hi all.
[03:20:44] <GreekFreak> I have a DataTable that is displayed in an initially hidden tab. I want to initialize it when I go into the tab. How do I do something like, " $("my-tab").onShow()
[03:21:03] <nFFF> Is there any other way than canvas that is more widely support, to get the rgba data of each pixel in an image?
[03:21:41] <Industrial> How do I get all sublings to the right/bottom of the current $() ?
[03:21:46] <Industrial> siblings*
[03:22:51] <oskude> hi, im wondering if theres regression to this http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8140 as this test shows the nested accordion still is oversized http://jsfiddle.net/SmFdt/60/
[03:23:02] <oskude> or am i doing something wrong?
[03:26:35] <oskude> oh well, at least that width: auto fixes it
[03:31:40] <soee> i have container and its content will change when page is reloaded or ajax call complete, now how can i call execute some action when its content is changed after ajax call was success ?
[03:32:06] <asher^> why not put it in the success function?
[03:32:29] <soee> asher^, i dont want to repeat code in many places
[03:33:00] <soee> or maybe it is possible to create function and execute after success ?
[03:33:04] <asher^> yes
[03:33:11] <asher^> just make a function and call it on success
[03:40:41] <soee> hmm asher^: Uncaught ReferenceError: processMessages is not defined
[03:40:59] <soee> its a function defined in js file
[04:01:38] <bokgroll> if I $.post to a .php which uses session_* do I have to bother with cookies in the ajax request or does it just workô?
[04:03:42] <Farid__> I am doing an AJAX that  gives me some HTML of form fields .. then I am doing JQuery $("#appversions").append(result); now anything that get appended to the appversion div is not coming up in the post
[04:03:55] <Farid__> any suggesting how i can get the data in PHP
[04:06:49] <xec> bokgroll: cookies work the same with ajax requests as any other http request afaik
[04:06:50] <mik__> Any update on getting the blog RSS feed working (http://feeds.feedburner.com/jquery/)?
[04:07:05] <bokgroll> xec: thanks
[04:07:10] <nail__> Farid__: your fields should reside somewhere inside the <form></form> tags
[04:07:51] <Farid__> the appversion div is in the form tag
[04:08:10] <Farid__> except its contents are created dynamically
[04:08:31] <Farid__> which is a set of radio buttons, chekc boxes and dropdown
[04:09:15] <aquatix> Farid__: if you look in firebug or similar, do you see it correctly inside the form tags?
[04:09:21] <serve> i'm trying to append to a div but my code doesnt work and the console returns no errors any ideas where to go from there?
[04:09:24] <nail__> and do you do anything special on submit, or is it the standard handler?
[04:10:06] <Cork> serve: pb your code (jsfiddle.net)
[04:11:31] <Farid__> interesting point aquatix... i dont seeem to see my form tag :).... let me try to find it.. then I will get backto you
[04:11:47] <aquatix> Farid__: ah :)
[04:11:57] * aquatix might not react immediately
[04:12:04] <aquatix> at work in another window ;)
[04:13:53] <Cork> btw anyone know of a link for really horrible classical tag soup? (looking for an example for a colleague)
[04:14:53] <aquatix> might find some on dailwtf.com
[04:14:56] <aquatix> *dailywtf
[04:15:30] <Cork> you mean thedailywtf.com ?
[04:15:40] <aquatix> sorry, yes
[04:15:46] <Cork> thx
[04:16:01] <aquatix> quite a nice site for reading about things you shouldn't do ;)
[04:16:11] <Farid__> Thanks aquatix... my form tag was not placed properly
[04:16:18] <aquatix> Farid__: check :)
[04:16:20] <Cork> :D
[04:16:29] <aquatix> Farid__: glad to be of help
[04:16:42] <Cork> aquatix: well i'm hoping to find a pre "shouldn't do" the old pre doctype style
[04:21:18] <aquatix> Cork: ah; sorry, would have to google myself for that too
[04:22:28] <Cork> aquatix: already have been, and its a bit hard to do, cause google doesn't really care much about the html markup of the page :)
[04:23:35] <DanHerp> Jquery ajax keeps returning "0" with the data from my function
[04:23:49] <DanHerp> I have looked and can't seem to find anything like that in my function
[04:24:00] <DanHerp> is there a reason jquery would be doing that?
[04:24:12] <Cork> DanHerp: what returns?
[04:24:20] <DanHerp> the data I want plus "0"
[04:24:34] <DanHerp> I have it set up to return an integer, it does plus 0 so if its like 60 it will do 600
[04:24:41] <Cork> you mean the success callbacks first argument is "0" ?
[04:24:43] <DanHerp> if my function isn't returning anything, it still comes back with 0
[04:25:10] <DanHerp> I'll paste my code
[04:25:15] <DanHerp> http://pastebin.com/q2eZ48mZ
[04:25:39] <Cork> and newpercentage is "0" ?
[04:25:42] <wathek> any idea how to make new element added draggable ?
[04:25:56] <DanHerp> new percentage is returning a number from my php function, so no
[04:26:11] <DanHerp> somehow 0 just gets added
[04:26:28] <Cork> DanHerp: ajax doesn't call functions
[04:26:29] <mik__> need to put die() in your php
[04:26:37] <Cork> it gets the response from your php page
[04:26:55] <DanHerp> Sorry, I worded that poorly
[04:27:01] <DanHerp> mik_: that might be it
[04:27:13] <DanHerp> yup!
[04:27:14] <DanHerp> Thank you
[04:27:18] <DanHerp> stupid mistake
[04:27:33] <mik__> Gets everyone once :D
[04:27:35] <Cork> wathek: create them as a dom object and add the draggable on them, then append them to the page
[04:27:48] <amirite> you're a dom object
[04:28:03] <wathek> Cork, huh ?!!
[04:28:26] <Cork> var dom = $(html); dom.draggable(); parent.append(dom);
[04:28:58] <wathek> oh ok let me try that
[04:29:29] <Cork> if you want to make parts of the html draggable, you need to use .find on the dom variable to filter it down
[04:29:50] <amirite> you're draggable
[04:30:01] <Cork> amirite: your having fun?
[04:30:05] <amirite> no
[04:30:38] <nlogax> nFFF: You already figured it out a long time ago, but came across your fiddle again in a tab. Do you need the image data for anything other than that? Because you can tell getImageData to get exactly the pixel(s) you are interested in
[04:30:43] <vl1234> @cork hole html page can possible to draggable
[04:30:45] <vl1234> ?
[04:31:13] <Cork> well not really as you can't validly add a complete html to another page
[04:31:15] <nFFF> nlogax, I solved the issue using js/canvas
[04:31:21] <nlogax> nFFF: Ah ok :)
[04:31:30] <Cork> vl1234: but except for that sure
[04:31:37] <nFFF> but basically canvas is not supported in i.e.,6,7,8
[04:31:41] <nFFF> so need to think of another way
[04:32:32] <Cork> explorercanvas!
[04:32:37] <nlogax> nFFF: http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ :)
[04:32:53] <Cork> bah you beet me to the link :)
[04:33:04] <vl1234> @cork.....i have a div with id...based on the id we can draggable for that perticular div
[04:33:22] <nlogax> Cork: Yeah, this is me http://thirdcity.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/beet1.jpg
[04:33:28] <nlogax> Beeting all the things
[04:33:29] <rabbi1> var flag = $('form').validationEngine('validate'); this line will return me 'true' or 'false' .. but will check for complete form, i just want to call this for a particular tab (JQ UI tab). how can i do this ?
[04:33:44] <wathek> thank you Cork
[04:33:46] <rabbi1> Cork: ^ hi, any help ?
[04:34:21] <Cork> rabbi1: if i remember correctly you can give it a range of elements to validate
[04:34:43] <Cork> nlogax: can't find that domain >_>
[04:35:00] <Cork> ah, there is came
[04:35:10] <Cork> lol
[04:35:12] <nlogax> Cork: Oops.. Serves me right for just grabbing the first image of a beet the internet would find
[04:36:54] <rabbi1> Cork: the document is not clear .....
[04:39:07] <juria_roberts> I have an iframe <iframe id="hybrid" width="728" height="90"></iframe> how do i make it show an html page and not the source code of the page?
[04:39:25] <rabbi1> Cork: how can i just pass to a single tab ?
[04:39:51] <Cork> rabbi1: as far as i know you can't, you need to filter to the fields of the tab your self
[04:41:40] <rabbi1> Cork: u mean tab.filter($('form').validationEngine('validate')) ?
[04:42:14] <rabbi1> where 'tab' is dynamic ?
[04:42:47] <Cork> rabbi1: $('form').find('#tab2 :input')
[04:43:33] <rabbi1> Cork: can i pass that ValidationEngine method to a find() ?
[04:44:16] <rabbi1> Cork: more over, that method will only validate for type of fields, and we can just ignore in this instance
[04:44:21] <Cork> my memory of the validate code is a bit foggy, but i think you can run it directly on a selection of elements yes
[04:46:06] <rabbi1> Cork: hmmm
[04:46:55] <rabbi1> validationEngine method is only defined in 'form' no other method can be used
[04:47:03] <ROBERTAS> Hi all, can anyone help me out about jqm?
[04:47:04] <DanHerp> What's the best way to edit an inline style?
[04:47:31] <Cork> 'form' isn't a function
[04:47:38] <Cork> its just a selector
[04:48:19] <rabbi1> yeah, but i am trying $('form').find(tab.validateEngine('validate');
[04:48:31] <Cork> where do you get tab from?
[04:48:40] <Cork> and what is it
[04:48:46] <rabbi1> tab is selected tab .....
[04:49:00] <Cork> so it points to the tab element in the page?
[04:49:20] <rabbi1> Cork: yeap
[04:49:33] <Cork> so tab.find('input, textarea, select').validateEngine('validate');
[04:49:34] <Cork> then
[04:50:10] <Cork> rabbi1: $('form').find( has no point in this situation
[04:51:13] <rabbi1> inside select: var tabid = ui.index; while (tabid-- < 0)  { checkTab = tabDivs.eq(tabid); validateTab(checkTab); }  here checkTab is the 'tab' paratemeter passed to validateTab() ... tabDivs are the tabs with class name .....
[04:51:50] <Cork> ok
[04:52:42] <rabbi1> Cork: trying you code , brb
[04:57:46] <rabbi1> Cork: now, its always true :(
[04:57:50] <rabbi1> not validating
[04:58:17] <Cork> what plugin are you using?
[04:59:01] <rabbi1> Cork: o that will return a length right ? missed this
[04:59:16] <rabbi1> I am using validationEngine
[04:59:51] <Cork> what it returns depends on the plugin, and it looks like i need to give a better answer
[05:00:58] <amirite> hey corky
[05:01:28] <Cork> rabbi1: so yes it runs validation on the fields in the selector
[05:01:40] <Cork> it runs var r = methods._validateField($(this), options); to be exact
[05:02:16] <rabbi1> so it will not return the length, it returns true or false ..... that's it. and why is it always true then :(
[05:02:32] <Cork> rabbi1: so no it should return true or false
[05:02:55] <rabbi1> Cork: ok, will have a look again, brb
[05:03:28] <Cork> rabbi1: read http://www.position-relative.net/creation/formValidator/js/jquery.validationEngine.js
[05:03:32] <Cork> that should help a lot
[05:03:54] <rabbi1> Cork: i have read through all that, still not much of a info...
[05:04:21] <ROBERTAS> http://jsfiddle.net/aMtPs/
[05:04:24] <Cork> rabbi1: if you run validate on something thats not a form you fall into a separate code chain
[05:04:36] <Cork> rabbi1: follow it and you see what it does and whats expected
[05:04:39] <ROBERTAS> is it posible to collapse to fixed height?
[05:04:45] <rabbi1> sure Cork
[05:05:19] <Cork> rabbi1: the code is fairly clean and easy to read
[05:05:30] <rabbi1> yeah
[05:05:53] <Teduardo> Does anyone have an example that combines multiple jqueryui slidebars and when the slidebars change the page shows content which matches the constraints selected in the slidebars?
[05:06:21] <amirite> teduardo what's the poop between three and quack ?
[05:06:44] <Teduardo> the answer to that question is x
[05:06:47] <Cork> amirite: you want me to ping one of the ops to kick you out?
[05:06:51] <j_ayen_green> Is there ANY difference in the results between having static onClick text and depositing it via .attr ?  What I'm running into is I have Omniture js loading After my script, which fires on page ready, and if I have a variable set in an onClick statically, the Omniture code knows about it, but if I have the same exact onClick code via .attr, Omniture ignores or misses it.
[05:07:15] <amirite> no corky i want you to ping one of the ops to spank you
[05:07:35] <Teduardo> someone needs a nap.... am i right?
[05:08:07] <systemfault> j_ayen_green: what prevents you from not using 90's technology and use a modern listener?
[05:08:49] <j_ayen_green> systemfault: nothing prevent me from not using... as I'm not using
[05:09:07] <Cork> j_ayen_green: ya, inline event listners is a pain and you should not use them *ever*
[05:09:37] <j_ayen_green> I tried using a click handler instead of .attr, same result
[05:10:01] <hemangpatel> Please see this my question : http://pastie.org/private/ct1i9js67yaonuobwenka
[05:10:03] <Cork> j_ayen_green: does the element exist in the page when your trying to select it?
[05:10:19] <j_ayen_green> basically, any jquery means of doing it results in the data not being picked up, even though inspecting the element (when I use .attr) shows the same onclick text
[05:10:27] <j_ayen_green> Cork: yes
[05:10:58] <j_ayen_green> but of course, a view source would not show the onclick, and I'm wondering if that difference is also what causes the data to be missed
[05:11:04] <Cork> j_ayen_green: adding event listners is not in anyway related to adding onclick to the element
[05:11:12] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: using "onclick" is bad in general
[05:11:12] <bot-t> (23 hours 20 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell gnarf the effects failures are from .data() not from .css()!
[05:11:13] <gnarf> ?inline
[05:11:14] <bot-t> don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[05:12:11] <Cork> hmm that factaoid need to be updated
[05:12:13] <j_ayen_green> I should mention that by necessity on this site the jquery is 1.2.6
[05:12:29] <Cork> j_ayen_green: that still applies
[05:13:08] <nlogax> nFFF: Here's the nice drawing I started on before you figured it out, probably not interesting any more :D https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1XELRh-hmmzSKsa30dzq-u1uo9bBljf-APs8i7oMAZ70/edit
[05:14:36] <j_ayen_green> Cork: ok, I'll try bind. But despite that... if inspecting the element shows the same onclick text after .attr  as when done statically, can you think of any method that Omniture might be using in their js/jquery to collect the dom data that would miss it when it isn't created statically?
[05:14:54] <gnarf> ?inline @cork
[05:14:55] <bot-t> cork, don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's on() method http://api.jquery.com/on - Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[05:15:00] <gnarf> better? :)
[05:15:01] <Cork> gnarf: nice
[05:15:10] <Cork> j_ayen_green: like i said, event listners and on* attributes is not the same thing
[05:15:34] <Cork> j_ayen_green: on* attributes is a legacy feature thats still around to provide support for old pages
[05:15:37] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: man, 1.2.6?
[05:15:51] <j_ayen_green> gnarf: yeah, drupal 6 has it baked in
[05:15:57] <gnarf> 2008-05-24 14:22:17
[05:15:59] <Cork> j_ayen_green: its a lousy way to handle events, as you ex. can't have multible listners and so on
[05:16:04] <gnarf> that is >4 years old now
[05:16:09] * Cork nods
[05:16:27] <Cork> j_ayen_green: thers jquery updater though
[05:16:31] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: newer drupal has newer jQuery - you should consider upgrading all of it some day
[05:16:37] <Cork> ?g drupal jquery_update
[05:16:38] <bot-t> Cork, jQuery Update | drupal.org - http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update/
[05:16:54] <gnarf> 1.3.2 is still pretty horribly old
[05:17:16] <gnarf> 3.5 years or so
[05:17:20] <Cork> ya, but its limited to how much compatibility you can add
[05:17:20] <j_ayen_green> Cork: well, the way Drupal handles json validation is 1.2.6 even if you update, and updating Drupal from 6 to 7 isn't an update, it's a rewrite with a site with any custom code
[05:17:44] <j_ayen_green> Cork: on the other, just seems weird that vanilla onClick works then
[05:18:10] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: would it help if I mention that since 1.3.2 we have solved like 1053 bugs in stable releases of jQuery?
[05:18:12] <Cork> j_ayen_green: it works, but it will break everything that tries to work with the event on the element
[05:18:35] <j_ayen_green> gnarf: hahaha, it would certainly give incentive
[05:18:37] <rabbi1> Cork: somehow its returning only true :(
[05:18:51] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: well, i just did that math for some post on stack overflow recently
[05:19:02] <Cork> rabbi1: time to breakpoint the plugin then, cause the code clearly have support for it
[05:19:29] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: seriously, i bet you drupal has solved a ton of bugs in that 6->7 upgrade too -- you are currently supporting code that was written before IE9 was even a release canidate
[05:19:38] <j_ayen_green> but we run into issues then with json... drupal core trying to validate one way and custom code using the newer version trying another... this shop's been through trying that already and is still working on it
[05:19:45] <j_ayen_green> Cork: gotcha
[05:19:55] <amirite> can someone kickban corky
[05:20:21] <Cork> gnarf: sigh, you feel up to doing something about that troller? -_-'
[05:20:21] <j_ayen_green> gnarf: yeah, I'm a Drupal developer. Many bugs have been fixed, but the architecture is 75% different, so many bugs have been added
[05:20:23] <gnarf> can? yes...
[05:20:42] <gnarf> will? probably not
[05:21:23] <rabbi1> Cork: there is one more method/ option in the plugin, called as onSuccess and onFailure, calling these two will give me the validation of each field is 'true' or 'false'. I am trying to add a class for input and change it onsuccess and revoke back onfailure....  but problem is, if I enter one 'required' field it is adding class 'valid' for all input fields.... any way i can limit the  toggling of class to that particular input ?
[05:21:54] <j_ayen_green> we're almost successful getting jquery 1.4x in, by loading it first and namespacing it...from what little I understand. Makes my eyes cross.
[05:22:09] <Cork> rabbi1: only way i can answer you is to read the code so...
[05:22:33] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: its a rough thing, trying to get 2 versions to behave along side each other...
[05:22:40] <rabbi1> hmm, okay have a nice day and thank you
[05:22:54] <Cork> rabbi1: good luck
[05:23:12] <j_ayen_green> gnarf: yes... and then certain modules load their own version on certain pages... one I think even loads prototype
[05:23:24] <Cork> rabbi1: (i meant only way i can answer you is by reading the code my self)
[05:23:41] <rabbi1> Cork: i got that point ;)
[05:23:41] <gnarf> j_ayen_green: so why exactly do people use drupal again if this is common practice in the community? :)
[05:24:04] <gnarf> it sounds like a clusterfuck of mismatched and incompatible plugins to me
[05:24:10] <Cork> rabbi1: i just realized it could be read another way so i wanted to clear that up :)
[05:24:11] <j_ayen_green> gnarf: the community is getting better. this is D6... the standards for module review improved greatly with D7.
[05:24:24] <j_ayen_green> and Drupal is still the best cms
[05:24:34] <rabbi1> Cork: i actually hit for the first glance ....
[05:25:03] <khurram> hi all
[05:26:05] * gnarf shrugs - back to hacking on our wordpress fed by github ;)
[05:26:18] <Industrial> Using http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit can I bypass the jQuery effect queue?
[05:26:44] * j_ayen_green shrugs too, back to hacking on drupal also fed by github
[05:37:02] <Industrial> Say I have two jQuery selections, one containing one element and another containing a few elements including the first.
[05:37:23] <Industrial> How do i get the latter selection without the former element in it?
[05:37:30] <Industrial> oh, _.filter :P
[05:37:57] <jcubic> you can also use _.not
[05:38:26] <bjensen> anyone here worked with jstree? I simply cannot get it to open all nodes upon start up
[05:39:00] <amirite> jstree is shit
[05:39:30] <sente> amirite isrite
[05:39:48] <bjensen> well what is the alternative ? jquery UI does not provide a Tree
[05:39:51] <sunbeam> i'd like to make a few navigation menu items that contain certain text <a href="#">This text</a> not clickable
[05:39:54] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this best?
[05:40:10] <amirite> don't use a tree -- what do you need a tree for? are you building windows explorer?
[05:40:51] <bjensen> amirite: thats a user experience, not technical so its not really helpful mate :-/
[05:41:48] <bjensen> question*
[05:43:39] <amirite> poop http://jquery-ui-tree.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/tree/default.html
[05:54:54] <sunbeam> i'd like to make a few navigation menu items that contain certain text <a href="#">This text</a> not clickable
[05:54:57] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do this best?
[05:59:29] <nlogax> sunbeam: thing.click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); ... stuff ... })
[06:04:56] <DukeDrake> why does my submit() listener not work -.-
[06:05:10] <xmaddness> jsfiddle or it didn't happen
[06:05:12] <xmaddness> :P
[06:05:17] <DukeDrake> yeah, I know
[06:05:31] <DukeDrake> I probably missed an obvious error
[06:05:55] <DukeDrake> <form id="myid"> .... </form> and $('#myid').submit( ... )  , right?
[06:07:07] <silv3r_m00n> in the success handler of an ajax call $('#pad').html(output) was not rendering the html correctly and had to do $('#pad').get(0).innerHTML = output;   why ?
[06:09:08] <sunbeam> nlogax: thanks
[06:09:28] <sunbeam> nlogax: another question, how do i find the <a> inside <nav> with as content "This Text" ?
[06:09:48] <jiu> guys why my code that is not wrapped in my $(function() {}); fn is executing first ?
[06:09:55] <jiu> can anybody help please
[06:10:50] <nlogax> sunbeam: I think you can use :contains(This Text), but that seems very brittle. Better to give it an id or something
[06:11:04] <nlogax> You don't want your site to break when someone updates some copy
[06:11:36] <sunbeam> hmm
[06:11:37] <sunbeam> yea
[06:11:58] <jiu> its normal that  $(function() {}); fn executes first when the page is loaded right ?
[06:14:34] <jiu> anyone ?..please
[06:21:45] <sekyms> Anyone use fabricjs
[06:26:36] <cwatson> Is document.getElementById('jsForm').getElementsByTagName('input') the same as $('jsForm').find('input')?
[06:26:44] <quicksilver> no
[06:27:02] <quicksilver> $('#jsForm').find('input')
[06:27:06] <quicksilver> or simply
[06:27:12] <quicksilver> $('#jsForm input')
[06:27:21] <cwatson> Dang, I always forget that hash. Thank!
[06:27:27] <cwatson> Thanks*
[06:28:07] <mbroadst> hey I'm using the position utility (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position) in order to show a popup under a button each time its clicked. The first time it works perfectly (my: "left top", at: "left bottom", of: "button"), but each subsequent time I click the button the position is offset further to the right even though the button never changes position. Any ideas what's going on here?
[06:36:57] <hooloovoo> mbroadst: are you sure the popup you have is properly removed when you hide it?
[06:38:07] <mbroadst> hooloovoo: it looks like "position" was meant to be called only once, not each time an event occurs. a bit confusing because in the docs for that function they call position on mouse move. By calling it once, and then just toggling that element I got it to work (maybe this is an issue with position re: show/hide)
[06:38:33] <raj> wow, lots of new faces in here
[06:41:17] <DanHerp> How does jQuery tell if an ajax function is successful?
[06:41:33] <DanHerp> If it contacts my function and hits a conditional with "exit;" does it still return success?
[06:41:43] <DanHerp> does "success" mean successfully contacted server?
[06:43:04] <Whirl3d-Out> good morning all.
[06:43:26] <hooloovoo> mornin
[06:43:38] <sekyms> danHerp you can get a failure off of success from a .net service
[06:44:08] <Whirl3d-Out> mbroadst, do you have some code you could post to jsfiddle to demonstrate your point? It sounds to me like you are either not removing the original message (like hooloovoo said) or your using the wrong scope for position
[06:44:37] <DanHerp> I'm sorry I don't understand. If jq doesn't receive anything back from the server, does it still fire success?
[06:45:10] <mbroadst> Whirl3d-Out: I actually figured it out, I think you missed my last line above - thanks though
[06:46:22] <Whirl3d> I just wanted to make sure that you understood the situation. Position is not a single use utility
[06:47:06] <Whirl3d> and the reason it works when you toggle is that it removes the element from the dom by setting display to none
[06:47:11] <Cork> DanHerp: no, if nothing is sent by the server the connection times out and your error callback is called
[06:49:10] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: oh I see, yeah it turns out the single use isn't going to work for me here because its using the dimensions of the button before jquery has time to style it
[06:49:52] <Whirl3d> what I am trying to say is there's no "single use"
[06:50:44] <Cork> Whirl3d: uh... nitpick, it doesn't remove the element from the dom through display: none
[06:50:55] <nicholasschulz> Uhm, why doesnt jquery work on my page? have the simplest 'click' script and it works in jsfiddle. someone please check the source and see if theres a flaw. http://bannaky.com/blog/
[06:50:57] <mbroadst> I understand, let me see if I can put together a sample in a fiddle
[06:51:05] <Cork> Whirl3d:  it makes the browser drop it from the rendering loop
[06:51:09] <Cork> but its still in the dom
[06:51:13] <Whirl3d> thanks Cork. Good (nitpick) point.
[06:51:56] <Whirl3d> I was speaking in context, but I see where that could be misleading...thanks
[06:52:06] <Cork> np :)
[06:55:54] <Whirl3d> nicholasschulz, I just glanced at your page but didn't see any click handler
[06:56:35] <Whirl3d> now, the reason it's not hiding your pic is that you ccall the hide method before the pic is loaded
[06:56:58] <nicholasschulz> Whirl3d: thanks for taking the time. found the 'problem' ; had the script before the element so there was no element to work with for the js
[06:57:09] <Whirl3d> to remedy that, you wrap your code in a document.ready wrapper like this:   $(document).ready(function () { your code });
[06:57:42] <nicholasschulz> ok, thanks Whirl3d :-)
[07:04:33] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: hmm, this stuff is using jquery ui 1.9, but I can't seem to find hosted versions of that to include in the fiddle. are you aware of any?
[07:05:27] <Whirl3d> not really. 1.8 should work for position, though.
[07:05:54] <Whirl3d> they have 1.89 in fiddle
[07:06:19] <asher^> Whirl3d, instead of using the document.ready thing you can simply use $(function() { ...
[07:06:48] <fubar10> Hey guys, I  was wondering how to implement an .each within a $.ajaxComplete
[07:07:59] <Whirl3d> asher^ I just watched a great video by Douglas Crockeford where he showed the problems with IEFE's. And his suggestion was that there was no advantage to doing it that way...it was a fad...and it caused problems if someone didn't terminate the script before that one correctly.
[07:08:53] <asher^> IEFEs?
[07:09:05] <ezio> anyone know how to get the ajax loader gif to stop loading from the server?
[07:09:21] <Whirl3d> Immediate Envoking Function Expressions.   or something like that
[07:09:45] <asher^> thats not what that is. what i wrote is identical to the document.ready way, just a shorter syntax
[07:10:12] <Whirl3d> except if i had this in a line before it    var x=3*x
[07:10:38] <Whirl3d> then the compiler would ready var x=3*  x(your iffe)    which would mess everthing up
[07:10:55] <asher^> $(document).ready(function () { ... }); === $(function() { ... });
[07:10:58] <Whirl3d> and to what advantage? it doesn't look nicer, it doesn't run faster, and it's not clearer what you are trying to do.
[07:11:00] <asher^> its not what you think it is
[07:11:24] <pppoe_dude> hello
[07:11:45] <Whirl3d> ah, I see. still what's the advantage?
[07:11:52] <pppoe_dude> I am using tablesorter, with this plugin (http://www.justinbritten.com/work/2008/08/tablesorter-filter-results-based-on-search-string/)
[07:11:55] <asher^> just shorter and nicer :)
[07:12:14] <asher^> jquery already takes care of the document.ready part
[07:12:20] <asher^> writing it again is redundant
[07:12:33] <pppoe_dude> I believe that my question can still be applicable if i was using pager plugin -- but is there a way to get rows to remember input elements, after they disappear due to filter or pager?
[07:13:02] <pppoe_dude> that, or to keep them persistent if a checkbox is checked no that row.
[07:13:44] <Whirl3d> I think that's gimmicky. I don't wrap any other functions in jquery, I don't see where it is more legible to wrap this one... It's purely a coding style thing and I prefer verbose-r over shorter, personally
[07:13:56] <Whirl3d> 8)
[07:14:18] <asher^> Whirl3d that argument only holds if you assume complete ignorance of the jquery source
[07:14:27] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: okay, I've got a little hacked up version that approaches my current solution here: http://jsfiddle.net/wDKfr/7/
[07:14:43] <pppoe_dude> actually, it might be doing that already, though i am not sure if results are predictable... will have to test some more.
[07:15:36] <asher^> effectively youre doing $(document).ready(function () { $(document).ready(function () { ... }); }); being more verbose is not a good thing if its like this
[07:16:05] <xec> asher^: that's not correct at all, and you're the one talking about ignorance?
[07:16:44] <xec> asher^: what you did there was nest two document ready handlers inside eachother
[07:16:52] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: that one doesn't actually show the position moving, it just doesn't show after the first toggle
[07:16:57] <Whirl3d> mbroadst, so what is the issue?
[07:17:14] <asher^> xec, ok, its not technically like that, but its the same idea. you are correct
[07:17:50] <fubar10> Does anyone know how to implement an $.each within a $.ajaxComplete function?
[07:18:26] <asher^> fubar10 youll have more luck if you show some code or be specific about what your problem is
[07:18:45] <theoN^> Is there any way to make a button that is disabled fire a click event? Without any wrappers involved ...
[07:18:49] <Whirl3d> mbroadst, that's because you hide the menu on document ready and then you show it on click.
[07:18:57] <Whirl3d> rather than toggle it on click
[07:19:17] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: oh, is it not updating? I changed that back to toggle after I pasted the link
[07:19:48] <Whirl3d> it's running slow again this a.m.
[07:20:01] <Whirl3d> what version are you on?
[07:20:27] <mbroadst> yeah sure is, I'm currently on version 13
[07:21:37] <Whirl3d> here's my suggestion: apply the position before the click handler.
[07:22:08] <Whirl3d> in other words, the position of the popup is not dependant on the click, so don't put it in the click handler
[07:22:51] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: ah, but this is what I was saying before about the "single" use of position. In a way, the position of the popup does indeed depend on the click. If the button does happen to move because of some sort of overflow then the position will have to change right?
[07:23:21] <Whirl3d> that's the joy of the position utility's use of of:
[07:23:46] <Whirl3d> it repositions if the target (supplied by of:) changes, I assume.
[07:23:48] <mbroadst> its a bit confusing because in the docs for that method (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Position) the position change happens inside the mousemove event
[07:24:03] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: okie doke, so my first solution is the way to go then
[07:24:05] <fubar10> asher^| Check this out: http://privatepaste.com/dc9c7265d4
[07:24:07] <nicholasschulz> i want the "white overlay" to stretch all the way to the bottom of the page, not just the screen size. How to do this? http://bannaky.com/blog/
[07:24:13] <Whirl3d> not the best example to use, I agree.
[07:24:53] <fubar10> asher^| The thing that I'm trying to do is parse through links that have images and if they have images, then attach those attributes. I'm able to have it work on content that I load directly, but not via ajax.
[07:25:41] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: the last problem is this: I'm using jquery ui's button for this button, unfortunately when I call "position" once at document ready it uses the dimensions of the button before jquery styles it and there doesn't seem to be a callback for that styling
[07:26:03] <mbroadst> it worked in the click handler, because styling had been long done at that point
[07:26:06] <asher^> fubar10, if you put your code on jsfiddle ill take a look
[07:26:42] <Whirl3d> so do it after the click handler, sorry
[07:27:06] <fubar10> asher^| The thing is that I can't reproduce the exact code since it's being generated by Drupal on the fly.
[07:27:09] <Whirl3d> There could be a micro-second where FOUC happens, but not likely.
[07:27:19] <mbroadst> Whirl3d: ah, no the position needs to be called on the menu not the button
[07:27:29] <mbroadst> but the position depends on the button
[07:27:39] <mbroadst> but the button is not styled, a bunch of catch 22's here :)
[07:27:53] <Whirl3d> still, do the button styling thing.
[07:28:00] <Whirl3d> then postion your menu
[07:28:58] <mbroadst> I guess this would also indicate that the "of" argument in position does not actually update properly because when I do it this way the dimensions it seems to be using to determine the bottom left of the button is some sort of incredibly small square in the middle of the button. the actual position basically puts the bottom left of the menu in the middle of the newly styled button
[07:30:10] <Whirl3d> Interesting point. Hopefully someone with jquery UI can address the issue. I am not sure if of: compensates for wrapped elements.
[07:30:31] <Whirl3d> Of course, I'm not even sure that the button gets wrapped, but I assume it is.
[07:30:32] <innociv> O
[07:30:41] <innociv> I've seen lots of issues with ui position, but never bothered reporting
[07:31:01] <innociv> most things working in one browser but not another
[07:31:41] <Whirl3d> I spent about six months working on something similar for (covers head) actionscript ....I like the UI implmentation but haven't had a lot of experience with it.
[07:32:23] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/d2USj/1/      <------   problem is described in js body
[07:32:42] <Whirl3d> css positioning, in my opinion is the worst. It is so much more complicated than is reasonable.
[07:33:03] <tash> hi, I'm using DataTables and events on page 2 don't work. Have a feeling it has to do with things maybe not existing in the DOM or something. Anyone used DataTables enough to know what I'm talking about?
[07:33:15] <tash> .click's are working on page 1, but not page 2
[07:33:35] <RohanBhangui> any help^^
[07:34:09] <Whirl3d> tash, perhaps you should be handling the click events on a parent container of your datables...a container that doesn't change between "pages"
[07:35:15] <Whirl3d> RohanBhangui, just a point of information for ya. It's a lot better to describe your problem here briefly so that people know what they are getting into before they go view your fiddle. I want to know if i can help before I start looking at someone's fiddle, for example.
[07:36:03] <RohanBhangui> kay
[07:36:25] <hlveheart> shoky, are you here? :>
[07:37:05] <Whirl3d> and a couple of other things: only put the inner contents of your body element in the html panel.
[07:37:17] <RohanBhangui> currently i dram the rohan item and it drags what i want to do is drag any open space and have the rohan item move around
[07:37:27] <tash> Whirl3d: I just tried that and it did the same thing.
[07:37:33] <Whirl3d> if you need to include scripts that aren't listed in the framework to the left, do so under "add resources"
[07:37:37] <hlveheart> eh, anyways. this is probably simple for anyone in here, can anyone get this pagination to function properly? http://jsfiddle.net/Sed5V/
[07:37:44] <RohanBhangui> but no matter how much i drag the  open space the rohan item should move
[07:37:57] <hlveheart> it's not functioning at all at the moment, as I've only started mocking it up...
[07:38:05] <tash> Whirl3d: apparently this is a common issue.  The Q listed at the top right of this page is probably the one I'm asking and need to answer: http://datatables.net/faqs#events
[07:38:13] <Whirl3d> tash, without a fiddle duplicating the error, we could spend all day guessing.
[07:38:22] <tash> I just don't really understand how to use fnGetNodes
[07:38:34] <tash> ok, I'll try a fiddle
[07:39:07] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/d2USj/1/
[07:39:11] <RohanBhangui> that is the fiddle agian
[07:39:35] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, you just hide the page, you don't show anything
[07:40:09] <Whirl3d> [10:37] <Whirl3d> and a couple of other things: only put the inner contents of your body element in the html panel.
[07:40:11] <hlveheart> i know i don't, I stopped coding it before coming in here lol
[07:40:31] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, give yourself some credit. You know what to show, show it.
[07:41:04] <Whirl3d> when the button is clicked, how do you select the page to show? put that right after your hide and you are good to go
[07:41:29] <hlveheart> errr, one sec.
[07:43:03] <Whirl3d> RohanBhangui, what is window.onscroll? Is that plain js? I am not familiar with it. I think you may mean $(window).scroll(
[07:43:37] <RohanBhangui> what ive done is use javascipt and juqery (where ever each is easier to implement :D)
[07:43:53] <Whirl3d> but you don't have a scrolling document
[07:44:02] <Whirl3d> how do you expect window.onscroll to work
[07:44:26] <Whirl3d> and PUT only the stuff inside your body tag in the HTML panel.
[07:44:50] <Whirl3d> the other stuff is either handled by the framework (to the left) or by adding resources (also to the left)
[07:45:58] <RohanBhangui> oh okay
[07:46:23] <RohanBhangui> but how to make open space draggable and when you try to drag it (the open space) the target switches to rohan item
[07:48:20] <Whirl3d> Draggable means that you can drag the item to change it's position. what you want to do is handle the mousedown and mouseup events on a content area that you have to provide.
[07:49:00] <Whirl3d> I have a feeling that you want to make the rohan button position relative to the scroll position of some element.
[07:49:40] <Whirl3d> in which case, you need to start with an element that is much larger than your window. Then place that in an element with overflow:hidden (possibly).
[07:50:21] <Whirl3d> Then select the really large content, make it draggable (inside the overflow:hidden div) and record it's relative position to update your rohan button accordingly.
[07:50:41] <Whirl3d> It's a big project that is not easy to do, I'm just warning you in advance.
[07:51:15] <RohanBhangui> okay will keep that in mind.....
[07:51:20] <RohanBhangui> thanks for heads up
[07:51:36] <hlveheart> Whirl3d; http://jsfiddle.net/Sed5V/1/
[07:51:40] <pandu101> hey guys, on a textbox, when user starts typing, I want the default value of the textbox to be erased. So Im trying to do it using this code --> 	$("#textbox1").keypress(function(){$(this).value=''}); <-- BUT, its not working and Im not sure why.
[07:51:44] <hlveheart> there's gotta be a neater way to do that
[07:51:54] <hlveheart> and I can't get the next/prev buttons to work, any suggestions?
[07:52:07] <hlveheart> like what the best way to code them would be?
[07:53:10] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, see...you got the buttons to work by yourself. Good job. the next and prev buttons are almost as easy...
[07:53:27] <hlveheart> using .next, and .previous?
[07:53:40] <pandu101> anyone?
[07:54:08] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, you know the "current" page visible, so $(".page:visible").next()   might give you the next page to make it visible.
[07:54:39] <pandu101> could someone help me figure out why this code is not working? --> $("#textbox1").keypress(function(){$(this).value=''});
[07:54:39] <Whirl3d> pandu101, have you looked at html5 placeholder attributes?
[07:54:41] <NoiseEee> pandu101: so anytime anyone presses any key in that input, you want to erase it?  so I could never type anything ever?!??
[07:54:54] <Whirl3d> value is not a jquery function
[07:55:02] <NoiseEee> also, jquery uses http://api.jquery.com/val/
[07:55:09] <pandu101> Whirl3d, I have an HTML5 ver of this form. But now Im creating a non-HTML5 version.
[07:55:19] <Whirl3d> use modernizer
[07:55:20] <NoiseEee> html5 has nothing to do with anything?!
[07:55:48] <pandu101> NoiseEee: I want the input box to only delete the default text, stuff like "ENter first name"
[07:55:52] <Whirl3d> NoiseEee, relax, man, the placeholder attribute replaces the function he is trying to make.
[07:56:21] <Whirl3d> pandu101, you should use the focus event to clear the field
[07:56:46] <pandu101> THing is I already use the focus event to focus on the form as soon as the page loads.
[07:56:54] <Sonja> is there a way to download all the jquery docs for offline reading?
[07:56:56] <Whirl3d> $(field).focus(function (){if ($(this).val()=="default") {$(this).val("");});
[07:57:10] <NoiseEee> GODDAMMIT IM RELAXED
[07:57:17] <pandu101> ahhhh... wow! Thats a good idea. I'll try it.
[07:57:26] <Whirl3d> NoiseEee, lol
[07:57:29] <pandu101> Whirl3d: Thanks
[07:57:39] <Whirl3d> np.
[07:58:43] <Whirl3d> pandu101, check this out for some ideas: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5eqAb/34/
[07:59:23] <Whirl3d> it's not exactly what you want, but it leverages the default value and placeholder and provides custom stylings for both
[07:59:48] <PeterB> I'm working with a JS loader (like requirejs) and no browser I've tried 'sees' the modules to let me set breakpoints in them

[08:00:53] <nanovirus> hey peeps... quick one: how do I select a radio button by it's value?  I can select using $('input[name=pickupType]:eq(0)').click();  but I want to select it by it's value (in this case 'test', or 'test2' or 'test3')
[08:01:10] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, I'm gonna write some comments for ya. Wait one minute
[08:01:15] <hlveheart> thanks
[08:04:29] <warrenparsons> nanovirus: $('input[value="test1"]) should work.
[08:04:49] <nanovirus> warrenparsons, cheers, much appreciated! =)

[08:16:02] <hlveheart> that, or ask up in #wordpress -- I'm sure they'd be able to help ;p
[08:16:49] <hlveheart> Whirl3d, any luck?
[08:19:27] <Whirl3d> sure. I am almost done when I realized a better way. Here is my first draft with comments...
[08:19:50] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Sed5V/4/    not working cause I changed my mind halfway through. but the comments are still good
[08:20:58] <hlveheart> Ahh. what'd you end changing half way through?
[08:21:07] <hlveheart> and thanks for the help btw, much appreciated
[08:21:37] <Whirl3d> since we are basically doing the same thing over and over, I want to capture that  and make it a function:

[08:43:14] <sunbeam> is it possible to conditionally set some CSS setting only for chrome?
[08:43:54] <hlveheart> sunbeam, yes
[08:43:59] <innociv> Why would you do that? But yes.
[08:44:02] <hlveheart> http://rafael.adm.br/css_browser_selector/
[08:44:17] <hlveheart> I love that for just that reason ^^
[08:45:16] <sunbeam> because chrome doesn't properly center body{background: center top;}
[08:45:19] <sunbeam> the image

[08:57:58] <jomofcw> Hello !
[08:58:08] <bnb_dev> Hi
[08:58:20] <jomofcw> Is there an existing "replacement SELECT" plugin in jQuery plz ?
[08:58:25] <bnb_dev> I am using jquery ui autocomplete combobox plugin
[08:58:34] <jomofcw> "SELECT replacement" probably better.
[08:58:35] <bnb_dev> here is my problem
[08:58:37] <bnb_dev> http://awesomescreenshot.com/01aa8b93d
[08:58:52] <asher^> jomofcw there are lots of them
[08:59:18] <bnb_dev> How I solve it?
[09:03:35] <innociv> bnb_dev, condition on if there is no results.
[09:03:54] <hemangpatel> asher^ : i think its done .. see this & Let me know is it correct way. http://pastie.org/private/r6zlprv6rl84zchl1ro65a
[09:05:14] <dizzyone> does anyone know any ease equations that do not require a duration?
[09:05:17] <bnb_dev> innociv: well
[09:05:26] <innociv> on your autocomplete
[09:05:33] <innociv> You should have a way to see if it's returned no results
[09:05:41] <bnb_dev> I am unable understand where i write the code?
[09:05:46] <dizzyone> im trying to add a quad easeInOut to the following: http://jsfiddle.net/dizzyone/rGY8P/9/
[09:06:00] <dizzyone> but the only equations I find require duration and I can't seem to get them to work
[09:06:05] <innociv> In your autocomplete results returning..
[09:06:16] <Whirl3d> jomofcw, there is...Look on benAllmans' site....I can't think of it right now, but it's something simple like selection.js or something...
[09:07:25] <EyePulp> so is $(function(){‚Ä¶   equivalent to $(document).ready(function(){‚Ä¶     for deferred actions until the DOM is complete?
[09:07:52] <Whirl3d> EyePulp, you had to bring that up again didn't you.
[09:07:57] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:08:45] <bnb_dev> innociv: http://jsfiddle.net/BbWza/39/
[09:08:55] <EyePulp> did I already ask that?  I'm sorry - I'm senile.
[09:08:55] <bnb_dev> The above link has the code
[09:09:08] <Whirl3d> dizzyone, I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish. can you describe more?
[09:09:12] <Guest56211> jquery plugin oter good sites???
[09:09:21] <Whirl3d> EyePulp, not you...we just had a big discussion about this earlier.
[09:09:39] <snimavat> I have cache:false in ajax setup - causing timestamp being appended to all the requests - That's fine.
[09:09:39] <snimavat> However when the response contains the script tags tht points to js files - jquery appends timestamps to reuqests for those js files as well.. making it impossible to cache the static resources.. Is there any way that I can have jquery append timstamps to get requests, but not when loading js files ?
[09:10:10] <innociv> if (this.value && (!request.term || matcher.test(text))) return { } else { //add value } no?
[09:10:44] <dizzyone> Whirl3d, im trying to get the color change to have a curved progression, like an ease shown here: http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/easing_demo.html
[09:10:46] <Whirl3d> I contend that it is inconsistent with the way we use jquery to use that shortcut for $(document).ready()    whether it's the same or equivalent or not...asher thinks it's cute and shorter, so why not. Douglas Crockeford thinks its bad form because it's misleading.
[09:10:51] <dizzyone> specifically easeInOut Quad
[09:11:04] <dizzyone> but it's not an animation
[09:11:09] <dizzyone> it's actually a health indicator
[09:11:20] <dizzyone> so I don't know what the percentage of health will be
[09:11:33] <dizzyone> which determines the progression of my little colored health bar
[09:11:34] <innociv> er wait you cna't do that, that'a s treturn
[09:11:39] <Whirl3d> use the easing formulae with a set duration
[09:11:40] <dizzyone> but I don'
[09:11:42] <dizzyone> t
[09:11:48] <dizzyone> understand these equations very well
[09:12:01] <dizzyone> it doesn't seem to work :S
[09:12:02] <Whirl3d> all the duration determines is the number of "slices" of time to evaluate the curve
[09:12:16] <dizzyone> ok let me try it again
[09:12:48] <innociv> I really don't know this code is a bit weird to me.
[09:13:02] <Whirl3d> if the animation cycles every 1/10 of a second and the duration is 10 seconds, you can see a block 10-segment animation. So determine your granularity on your color change and apply it that way.
[09:13:09] <EyePulp> Whirl3d: interesting - I find the $(document).ready(function(){ a bit more readable
[09:13:21] <Whirl3d> me too, EyePulp
[09:13:21] <jomofcw> OK thanks ^^.
[09:14:06] <jomofcw> Whirl3d hm nothing about benAllmans' in google...
[09:14:12] <innociv> It is something around "if (this.value && (!request.term || matcher.test(text))) return" but I can't figure what condition you want to return something else

[09:19:14] <jomofcw> Whirl3d OK, thanks for your help.
[09:19:51] <EyePulp> hrm - what's a good approach for having an element take up space but not be visible - so when I fade it in& out there isn't a big vacuum created in the layout swallowing up everything else?
[09:20:20] <Whirl3d> don't use the fade shortcuts (which set display:none) just animate opacity
[09:20:34] <dizzyone> Whirl3d
[09:20:49] <dizzyone> you were right on the granulation
[09:20:55] <dizzyone> I got it working with duration set to 5
[09:20:56] <dizzyone> http://jsfiddle.net/dizzyone/rGY8P/11/
[09:20:58] <dizzyone> but the problem is
[09:21:03] <dizzyone> I don't control the granulation
[09:21:22] <dizzyone> something else controls how much damage is done to the health
[09:21:23] <Whirl3d> dizzyone, think of the formula as using %
[09:21:45] * imsky yawns
[09:22:52] <Whirl3d> t/d is the percent...so the formula then becomes   -c * (pct*(pct-2))+b   where c is the change and b is the beginning.
[09:23:24] <Whirl3d> but what is the minimum amount of damage that can be done
[09:24:07] <dizzyone> oh thanks that helps :)
[09:24:11] <dizzyone> I don't really know though
[09:24:23] <dizzyone> I'll just fiddle with it, thank you :)
[09:24:23] <Whirl3d> you'll have to have some idea or it won't work
[09:24:28] <dizzyone> hmm
[09:24:29] <Whirl3d> np
[09:25:02] <Whirl3d> if you think of health as being 1-100 then 1 is the min amount of damage possible
[09:25:06] <loincloth> is there a js or jquery way to bind a function to when an inserted dom element is 'ready' ?
[09:25:16] <loincloth> i want to get the dimensions as applied by css
[09:25:29] <loincloth> and there seems to be inconsistent timing when just doing an insert and then checking for dimensions
[09:26:00] <Whirl3d> set a timeout and check maybe?
[09:26:23] <loincloth> i mean sure, but that's not very robust
[09:26:39] <Whirl3d> bring it up with browser devs, not me. LOL
[09:26:41] <loincloth> i've certainly done it before in the absence of proper event hooks
[09:27:08] <silverwind> loincloth, people use event delegation in that case.
[09:27:19] <silverwind> Ahhh
[09:27:26] <silverwind> On insert... then I don't know.
[09:27:29] <Sander^home> How do I add an <a> link around an item?
[09:27:45] <silverwind> Sander^home, See the wrap/wrapInner functions
[09:27:48] <Whirl3d> $(item).wrap("<a/>");
[09:28:01] <loincloth> silverwind: yeah if i knew of an event to bind to i'd be good i think
[09:28:07] <loincloth> but i dunno if such a thing exists
[09:28:32] <loincloth> it's not horrible to write these dimensions once in css and once in this file, but it's of course not great
[09:28:33] <jomofcw> Whirl3d you find something on Ben website ?
[09:28:33] <Whirl3d> loincloth, that's the rub. there is no common event
[09:28:37] <silverwind> Not sure I get it though... dom insertion are synchronous, no?
[09:28:49] <loincloth> Whirl3d: indeed that seems to be the concensus
[09:28:55] <silverwind> If so, just check the computed style
[09:29:07] <loincloth> well that's what i'm trying to do i believe
[09:29:15] <Whirl3d> jomofcw, sorry, adhd here. I got distracted...i'll look again.
[09:29:19] <loincloth> it just doesn't report properly until some unknown time after the insert happens
[09:29:23] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, I also need to add href.. how do I do that?
[09:29:56] <Whirl3d> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-replacetext-plugin/   I'm not sure that's what you wanted, but here is what I was thinking
[09:30:07] <jomofcw> Whirl3d no prob ^^ !
[09:30:55] <Whirl3d> Sander^home, ? wrap
[09:31:05] <Whirl3d> ?wrap @ Sander^home
[09:31:09] <bot-t> Sander^home, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[09:31:30] <jomofcw> Whirl3d hm ok so I should explain it better. i have a SELECT element in my DOM. I want to put in it some rich content (as image for example). So I need to rewrite/replace it with JS (and so with jQuery).
[09:31:31] <Whirl3d> bot-t +1
[09:32:03] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:34:36] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, is this correct?: var linkme = $("a").attr('href', href); $(item.wrap(linkme);
[09:35:18] <TrentonDAdams> is there a way of asking jquery to do nothing?  I'd like to make my system fall back to regular http form posting.
[09:35:42] <Whirl3d> Sander^home, did you try it? It looks reasonable to me but head on over to jsfiddle.net and try it out.
[09:35:43] <TrentonDAdams> Without needing to conditionalize a whole whack of code.
[09:35:57] <Whirl3d> jomofcw, maybe: http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/jquery-image-dropdown
[09:36:00] <Whirl3d> not sure...
[09:36:26] <TrentonDAdams> Or, is it not worth the effort perhaps?  Most modern browsers should just work.
[09:36:31] <jomofcw> that's it Whirl3d ^^ ! Many thanks :D.
[09:37:07] <Whirl3d> TrentonDAdams, jquery won't do anything unless you tell it to
[09:37:59] <TrentonDAdams> Whirl3d: Well I know, but I was thinking it would be nice to have the code not actually run, if the user's browser wasn't supported, or something like that.
[09:38:30] <Whirl3d> TrentonDAdams, then it won't run if it cant...
[09:38:48] <Whirl3d> If they have js disabled, for example, it won't run
[09:38:49] <TrentonDAdams> Well, I'm not convinced of that.
[09:38:55] <jomofcw> And now I've got my keyword, so I can find many other :D cool :D.
[09:39:06] <lahwran> does datepicker to The Right Thing if I do it to the same element more than once?
[09:39:17] <TrentonDAdams> Whirl3d: Yes, but what if JS is enabled, but that particular browser has bugs?
[09:39:18] <Whirl3d> ok, sorry, but I'm not interested in convincing you of it, so ....
[09:39:29] <jomofcw> TrentonDAdams try to unbind submit event ?
[09:39:30] <Whirl3d> jquery handles most of that
[09:39:47] <TrentonDAdams> jomofcw: I'll look into that.
[09:40:27] <Whirl3d> If you are looking for the really odd case that it doesn't it seems kinda weird to rely on jquery to a) know that it's not gonna work, and b) to do something else?
[09:41:15] <Whirl3d> TrentonDAdams, perhaps you have an example? Or are you just trying to proactively find the rare case that jquery might fail?
[09:43:39] <TrentonDAdams> Whirl3d: No, I wanted to "tell" jquery not to run.  i.e. someone reports a problem, I find out the browser agent, and in my HTML output, when jquery is loaded, I say "do nothing".  That way, I don't have to conditionalize a whole whack of my scripts.
[09:44:26] <TrentonDAdams> Anyhow, if it can't do that, I think it's probably not worth my time trying. :P
[09:44:30] <Whirl3d> unload jquery or reassing it's alias
[09:44:33] <TrentonDAdams> Too much conditionalization of code.
[09:44:44] <TrentonDAdams> reassing it's alias?
[09:44:57] <Whirl3d> right now $ = jquery   so set $=null
[09:44:59] <TrentonDAdams> If I unload jquery, won't those scripts then throw errors?
[09:45:12] <TrentonDAdams> I mean sure, that'll just go to the console output, but that might be annoying.
[09:45:44] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, It's not working: http://jsfiddle.net/HTthh/
[09:45:55] <MichMich> Hiya!
[09:46:22] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: that is not how you deal with browser bugs, at all :|
[09:46:46] <Whirl3d> Sander^home, wtf? that's not wrapping anything and there's no #topics in your example to start with?
[09:46:48] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Well, I was thinking more catastrophic ones, that really aren't worth fixing.  e.g. just don't use js
[09:46:59] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: But, that's probably a very rare user these days.
[09:47:36] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, I added a text there "Test".. which I want to wrap a link around.
[09:48:15] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, I basicly want to built up the html "<a href="http://google.com">Test</a>
[09:48:23] <ajpiano> TrentonDAdams: if you want to offer a simpler experience
[09:48:40] <ajpiano> the modern approach is to use feature detection and then conditionally load scripts
[09:48:43] <ajpiano> that power your app
[09:48:57] <ajpiano> you don't log people's user agent strings and then block other people with matching user agent string later :p
[09:49:26] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: I'm a lazy programmer, lol.  Conditionalizing everything is more work. :P
[09:49:29] <ajpiano> http://yepnopejs.com/
[09:50:09] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: our web stats show that pretty much everyone are using the newer browsers; at least new enough for jquery to support.  So I'm probably wasting my time thinking about it. :P
[09:50:21] <ajpiano> safe to say
[09:50:41] <TrentonDAdams> ajpiano: Hmm, interesting library
[09:51:17] <Whirl3d> Sander^home, you crack me up. I tell you about wrap and give you the link, you make a fiddle that doesn't have wrap in it and then claim it doesnt work. Hmm... http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HTthh/4/
[09:54:35] <jomofcw> Have a nice evening :).
[09:55:16] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, the link google.com is a parameter.. at the end of this link, there is a wrap: http://jsfiddle.net/HTthh/
[09:55:21] <molavy> hi
[09:55:31] * hlveheart slaps molavy around a bit with a large trout
[09:55:44] <molavy> what is best js 2d game library that work on canvas
[09:55:44] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, I guess I need to do an attr('href', "http://google.com"); somewhere.
[09:56:07] <Whirl3d> Sander^home, there is no word "wrap" anywhere in the link you provided
[09:56:48] <molavy> ?
[09:56:54] <molavy> i want start making 2d game using canvas
[09:57:41] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, In the bottom I wrote: var linkme = $("a").attr('href', "http://google.com"); topic_td.wrap(linkme);‚Äã
[09:57:44] <molavy> any idea?
[09:57:57] <tippenzwei> I have a question about this: http://jsfiddle.net/tippenein/JM9qV/2/
[09:58:17] <Whirl3d> did you click update?
[09:58:25] <tippenzwei> yes
[09:58:36] <Whirl3d> sorry, Sander^home, did you click update
[09:58:43] <tippenzwei> : )
[09:58:58] <molavy> there is no idea?
[09:59:36] <Whirl3d> tippenzwei, you are asking jquery to change the html of the submit button to be a paragraph....
[09:59:58] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, sorry.. Try now: http://jsfiddle.net/HTthh/5/
[10:01:38] <tippenzwei> Whirl3d I want it to replace the submit button with a gif and those words
[10:01:41] <tippenzwei> when it is loading
[10:02:11] <tippenzwei> so, yes.   the css I thought would make it appear with the gif

[10:05:16] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, Well.. the link is not a text.. it's a variable which may change.
[10:06:27] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HTthh/9/
[10:06:41] <Whirl3d> so change the variable to the text you want

[10:08:21] <gulli> Hey guys, I'm dealing with a problem here that might possibly
[10:08:21] <gulli> be caused by the .find function.
[10:08:33] <gulli> The things is that I'm dynamically creating buttons
[10:08:34] <gulli> and appending them to a div via the .html function.
[10:08:41] <gulli> See here: http://pastebin.com/sk7kbzRi
[10:08:56] <Sander^home> Whirl3d, thanks alot!
[10:09:07] <Whirl3d> np
[10:09:08] <gulli> Now, I can see the buttons appear without any problems. My problems begins here: I need to click the button TWICE to get It's expected behaviour to work, the weird thing is that everything works (alert works, etc) until I get to the .find part.
[10:09:18] <gulli> I need to use .find to get the id of the button clicked, to be able
[10:09:18] <gulli> to post it to a php script which inserts the id into a database.
[10:09:32] <gulli> (We are querying the server each second by the way)
[10:09:38] <gulli> This works fine when I click twice, but it won't happen by clicking it once.
[10:09:42] <Whirl3d> gulli, use jsfiddle. It's so much better for this kind of thing..just cut and paste your html, js, and css and it'll be a lot easier to help with.
[10:09:45] <gulli> Here is the process: http://pastebin.com/giefv7rr
[10:09:53] <gulli> ahh ok
[10:10:40] <AL13N> it seems parseXML() (also used by returning ajax calls) has a serious security bug: it seems to parse escaped html... like '&lt;'
[10:11:33] <gulli> it seems like the html does not become a part of the DOM tree,
[10:11:33] <gulli> and that makes sense aswell since I can't see the buttons
[10:11:33] <gulli> in the source code(I'm able to inspeect their element though).
[10:11:37] <tippenzwei> I feel like my code, might do the wrong thing even if it was working
[10:11:38] <gulli> Any suggestions?
[10:12:01] <AL13N> eg: $.parseXML('<?xml ?><root attr="&lt;mail&gt;">text: &lt;bla&gt;</root>')
[10:12:13] <tippenzwei> http://jsfiddle.net/tippenein/JM9qV/2/   |  the :submit selector would grab multiple submit buttons and make them all loading class paragraph
[10:12:13] <hlveheart> lol
[10:13:06] <Whirl3d> gulli, I would suggest that jsfiddle will be easier to demonstrate the notion that you should be using .on to handle delegation of your click events. It should solve the problem, but pastebin doesn't really give any good way to demonstrate that
[10:13:32] <gulli> yeah, thats true, but then I would probably have to paste the whole code ><
[10:13:39] <AL13N> can anyone confirm?
[10:14:28] <Whirl3d> tippenzwei, try referring to the current submit button as $(this)   and maybe try: replaceWith() or better yet, just have the loading paragraph hidden and while loading show the paragraph, hide the button
[10:14:39] <gulli> but thanks though guys :D
[10:14:52] <Whirl3d> gulli, try usig .on
[10:15:06] <Whirl3d> and since it's too much work for you to cut and paste, I'll do it for you.
[10:16:40] <tippenzwei> Wjirl3d, I'll give it a shot. thanks
[10:23:49] <Whirl3d> gulli, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/rB6c6/6/   fiddles are running slow today
[10:24:12] <Whirl3d> rather than using .llve use .on
[10:25:21] <Whirl3d> if you handle the "click" event for your buttons on the table (which doesn't change as a whole), then you can accommodate any number of descendant button actions...
[10:28:31] <gulli> Ahhhh
[10:28:34] <gulli> thanks man :)
[10:29:38] <Whirl3d> np. See the difference between using .live and .on.....the handler gets bound an element that is always there. So .live is really just .on applied to the document...which is slow and unnecessary.
[10:30:07] <gulli> yup
[10:30:36] <wathek> hi everybody
[10:30:56] <wathek> is there a way to check if a complete html code existe under one element or not ?
[10:31:18] <fission6> when i do $something.html($(another)) it looks like jquery is removing the html from the dom and moving to another vs copying it?
[10:31:23] <wathek> let's say I want to know if #mydiv have this piece of html code <img src="tmp/im.png" alt="mm">
[10:32:14] <Whirl3d> wathek, you would try $("#mydiv").find("img [src='tmp/im.png']").length>0
[10:32:35] <ChkDigit> I think that one is right in the tutorial, no?
[10:33:07] <wathek> Whirl3d, the problem is that I got a string with the html code
[10:33:08] <SupaLoused> Hi. Im a graphic designer and im trying to emulate the nav from this template http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/39573.html without breaking my head. Does someone in here could guide me or lend me some tutorials easy to follow to achieve something similar please?
[10:33:32] <fission6> http://dpaste.org/m2SWA/ why is this code removing the inject content from the dom vs copying it!?
[10:34:45] <osoba> guys how would i insert a var here? http://jsfiddle.net/8WNtg/
[10:34:49] <Whirl3d> SupaLoused, the graphic on the side is a constant. the spaces before the button elements are divs that are animated by width. It should be really simple to emulate. Lookup $.animate()
[10:35:48] <Whirl3d> osoba, no need to add quotes, just put the variable name
[10:35:54] <fission6> is that the right functionality - to remove dom elements if html($(existing dom elements))
[10:35:58] <osoba>  i tred that doesnt work Whirl3d
[10:36:17] <Whirl3d> osoba, what doesn't work
[10:36:25] <osoba> removing the quotes
[10:36:31] <Whirl3d> wow
[10:36:39] <osoba> let me elaborate
[10:36:43] <SupaLoused> Thank you :), now i have an idea.
[10:36:51] <Whirl3d> ;)
[10:37:23] <osoba> what i would want in that line is this     prev: '.blabla'
[10:37:30] <osoba> but how to achieve that with a variable
[10:37:35] <fission6> wait do i have to use clone() seems silly?
[10:39:18] <Whirl3d> fission6, you really should use jsfiddle. uggh I wish that were a requirement to ask for help. But none the less, you are telling it to use  the element (which you stored in the varaiable) as the html...try .html($injectitems.html());
[10:40:15] <Whirl3d> that should copy the html from the variable and use it rather than to remove the element and apply it somewhere else
[10:40:33] <Whirl3d> clone would also be good, but then you would want to append it rather than html() it
[10:40:38] <fission6> Whirl3d: ok
[10:41:18] <silverwind> also... .remove() doesn't kill/destroy/annihilate nodes... it "removes" them from the main DOM (rendering) tree
[10:42:02] <Whirl3d> osoba, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/8WNtg/2/
[10:42:04] <AL13N> it seems parseXML() (also used by returning ajax calls) has a serious security bug: it seems to parse escaped html...: you can test with: $.parseXML('<?xml ?><root attr="&lt;mail&gt;">text: &lt;bla&gt;</root>') Can anyone confirm?
[10:42:34] <fission6> Whirl3d: html() works but only copies the first element
[10:43:06] <silverwind> If you want to do DOM manipulations, you don't use .html
[10:43:39] <fission6> ok i got it
[10:43:47] <fission6> silverwind: in what sense?
[10:44:14] <fission6> i am using twitter caraousel, by i have a list of slide shows, i am dynamically loading content into the carousel based on user selection
[10:44:53] <silverwind> fission6, if you really have to build your html as a string then it's fine to use .html
[10:45:13] <silverwind> fission6, if you only need to move/hide contents, move nodes instead
[10:45:38] <osoba> Whirl3d: obviously that was my first try :|
[10:45:40] <Whirl3d> use clone and append
[10:45:47] <osoba> as i said it doesnt work like that either
[10:46:01] <Whirl3d> it obviously is something else wrong withyour code
[10:46:31] <Whirl3d> if it works there, it should work in the other parts. But who knows what .slideshow() does?
[10:46:48] <Crimlo> i know this is jquery so can someone who's familiar with html5 private me please
[10:46:54] <Whirl3d> maybe you could withhold a couple more details and see if it's any easier to figure out
[10:47:27] <osoba> give me a minute to setup a real fiddle
[10:48:31] <Whirl3d> fission6 so the user selection comes from a table of options?
[10:49:08] <Crimlo> wow what douches
[10:49:49] <Whirl3d> Crimlo, go to hell. I don't know html5 enough to help and who knows if anyone else can help. Now if anyone helps you they are just asking for trouble.
[10:50:25] <Crimlo> wow some community, sad
[10:50:27] <mikkelb> I can help you Crimlo
[10:50:35] <Crimlo> thanks bro
[10:50:56] * mikkelb is now playing: Flying Lotus - Camel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6SXXx1Fu_4)
[10:51:11] <Whirl3d> Took him 5 minutes to reply and you are already gonna call us all douches? who the douche now?
[10:51:31] <Crimlo> dude i have nothing else to say to you
[10:51:36] <Crimlo> so just move along
[10:51:54] <Whirl3d> lol
[10:52:32] <ElGoorf> you know theres a html channel right?
[10:52:35] <mikkelb> Crimlo: You _need_ to shut the fuck up
[10:52:43] <ElGoorf> anyway, i has a q
[10:52:52] <osoba> :|
[10:52:59] <osoba> ok so this works in jsfiddle but not in my browser :||
[10:53:11] <Crimlo> there's really an html5 channel?
[10:53:20] <Whirl3d> osoba, that happens to me all the time
[10:53:24] <Crimlo> i am not that familiar with thise
[10:53:24] <Crimlo> this**
[10:53:28] <Crimlo> where can i find it?
[10:53:30] <Whirl3d> elGoorf, what's your question
[10:53:39] <osoba> this is my fiddle Whirl3d http://jsfiddle.net/8WNtg/6/
[10:55:09] <Whirl3d> osoba, you can use .data('next') to access your data-prefixed attributes in jquery
[10:55:34] <Whirl3d> so .data("next") is the same as .attr("data-next') basically.
[10:56:02] <ElGoorf> I have a web page UI, part of which is a form. clicking other elements calls a .load in the form container to show the relevant form, like so -> $panel.empty().load("newform.html") which I assumed would remove data attributed with the old form, but the form's still acting with data fromt he original form
[10:56:16] <Whirl3d> though it doesn't work the other way around:   $(elem).data("something")  !== $("elem").attr("data-something")
[10:56:31] <osoba> meh it doesnt matter which one i use
[10:56:32] <ElGoorf> ugh.. i know thats pretty bad description and probably need pastebin but the code is huge >.>
[10:57:08] <Whirl3d> ElGoorf, don't use pastebin, please use jsfiddle
[10:57:16] <ElGoorf> that too
[10:57:25] <ElGoorf> ok i'll have a go and chop out as much code as i can
[10:57:28] <Whirl3d> still, where is your data being stored for the form
[10:57:56] <Whirl3d> if it's stored in the form's data object, you may want to create a new form element and use replaceWith
[10:59:40] <ElGoorf> good point Whirl3d
[10:59:48] <osoba> i siiiiiiiiigh -_-
[10:59:56] <jtomasrl> why an $("#name") selector is giving me an array?
[11:00:13] <osoba> Whirl3d: its not a js error, a data-prev was wrongly filled in another slider
[11:00:27] <osoba> well those were productive 60 minutes :|
[11:00:37] <Whirl3d> for us all I think. LOL
[11:01:03] <Whirl3d> jtomasri, it's giving you a jquery object (which looks and acts a lot like an array)
[11:01:24] <Whirl3d> to get to the original element, use $("#name")[0]
[11:01:52] <jtomasrl> whirl3d so how can i work with the jquery object, like getting its value
[11:02:03] <Doxin> how do I remove an element with a specific id from the document?
[11:02:14] <Whirl3d> jquery has a ton of methods you can use on it. One is .val()
[11:02:32] <Whirl3d> Doxin, $("#elementid").remove();
[11:02:38] <Doxin> Whirl3d: thanks
[11:02:45] <jtomasrl> i see..
[11:03:57] <Whirl3d> where is everyone today?
[11:07:51] <tw2113> codin'
[11:08:07] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: In the armpit of the midwest, AKA Toledo.
[11:08:30] <Whirl3d> what I should be doin' :   codin'
[11:08:44] <Whirl3d> warrenparsons, toledo? I'm in Atlanta....
[11:09:13] <Whirl3d> if toledo is the armpit that would make us the stank hind quarters...about accurate
[11:10:08] <Doxin> Whirl3d: $("#someid").remove() doesn't seem to be working, what gives?
[11:10:27] <Whirl3d> try detach()?
[11:10:48] <asher^> you dont want to deteach objects if youre trying to remove them
[11:10:49] <Whirl3d> ? remove
[11:10:53] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[11:11:03] <silverwind> detach is the same as remove except that it doesn't unbind events IIRC
[11:11:10] <Doxin> Whirl3d: nope.
[11:11:14] <Doxin> Whirl3d: still not working
[11:11:21] <Doxin> Whirl3d: lemme pastebin what I'm doing
[11:11:30] <asher^> Doxin, have jsfiddle?
[11:11:31] <Whirl3d> use JSFIDDLE.net. please
[11:11:35] <gnarf> silverwind: you recall correctly
[11:11:46] <asher^> maybe the selector isnt right
[11:11:51] <asher^> check it in console
[11:11:53] <gnarf> silverwind: .remove() nukes the jQuery data cache
[11:11:56] <gnarf> only real diff
[11:12:08] <silverwind> <(^^<)
[11:12:19] <Doxin> asher^: nope.
[11:12:27] <silverwind> gnarf, ah, makes sense :)
[11:12:29] <asher^> yeah, detach keeps it in memory, remove kills it
[11:12:46] <mikkelb> Crimlo: so where we at?
[11:12:48] <asher^> Doxin nope to what?
[11:13:01] <Doxin> asher^: if I'm doing this: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/23926/ how can the selector be wrong?
[11:13:20] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Nice. It helps to know there's worse out there. I think...
[11:13:31] <asher^> ugh, please use jsfiddle
[11:13:42] <Whirl3d> id's start with letters
[11:13:55] <asher^> can you put the full code in there pls
[11:14:00] <molavy> i want start making 2d game using canvas
[11:14:02] <asher^> having that on its own tells us nothing
[11:14:20] <molavy> what is best game engine or library?
[11:14:26] <asher^> also, i can tell from those 3 lines that it wont work Doxin
[11:14:39] <asher^> by the third line, the selector doesnt reference anything
[11:14:40] <Doxin> asher^: it works here: http://jsfiddle.net/WMZCS/
[11:14:43] <Doxin> asher^: but do tell?
[11:15:11] <asher^> line 2 writes over the html in #0
[11:15:16] <asher^> so #1 doesnt exist any more
[11:15:28] <asher^> maybe you were looking for .append() ?
[11:15:36] <Doxin> asher^: then do tell why I've got hello1. hello2. in my screen?
[11:15:48] <asher^> on the jsfiddle i only see hello2
[11:16:08] <Doxin> asher^: something fishy is going on here :I
[11:16:12] <asher^> if you paste the code youre actually working with i might be able to help
[11:16:41] <Doxin> asher^: problem is that it runs inside a proprietary app based on webkit
[11:16:55] <Doxin> asher^: but all it does is push javascript events, how could that go wrong?
[11:17:15] <asher^> well, you need something representative at least. as i said, the code you gave isnt doing anything with line 3
[11:17:42] <Doxin> hmm
[11:17:54] <Doxin> asher^: I'm trying to figure out what's going wrong :I
[11:18:26] <asher^> id like to help, but i cant without some represetative code
[11:18:55] <Doxin> asher^: oh, derp. I see what's going on here :P
[11:20:00] <Doxin> asher^: sorry for that,
[11:20:05] <asher^> np
[11:20:06] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Looks like HTML5 allows pretty much any character in ID values, including leading numbers.
[11:20:25] <asher^> you can even use penguins i think warrenparsons
[11:22:22] <Whirl3d> so if I wasn't sure that someone passed an id or a class in a variable, i should be able to use $(elem, "#"+elem, "."+elem) to grab the elem if its a class, id or valid selector, right?
[11:23:13] <Whirl3d> warrenparsons, do you have a link to that. I was trying to find it the other day...
[11:23:29] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Just a quick google search -http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/html5-id-class
[11:25:15] <Whirl3d> found it. I was looking for http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/elements.html#the-id-attribute
[11:27:03] <Whirl3d> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/70579/what-are-valid-values-for-the-id-attribute-in-html
[11:28:09] <someprimetime> yo Whirl3d would you recommend against using a custom attribute e.g. `dir="up"` instead of data-dir="up" ?
[11:28:18] <someprimetime> or does it not really matter?
[11:28:33] <someprimetime> i think the only benefit is that you get jquery's data() with the data-* selector
[11:28:38] <someprimetime> err attribute, rather
[11:28:46] <someprimetime> but i'm not too sure
[11:28:48] <Whirl3d> I'm probably not the best person to ask, but I tend to stay away from custom attributes. data-dir works great, though.
[11:28:57] <asher^> id stick with not making up your own attributes :p
[11:28:58] <someprimetime> cool +1 i'll start doing that instead
[11:29:23] <someprimetime> well the only reason i ask is because I built a clone of reddit and i noticed that they were using dir="up", dir="down"
[11:30:20] <Whirl3d> I don't think it's really a problem, but until I know for sure, I keep it safe with the data-prefix.
[11:30:36] <Whirl3d> Plus just logically, it's nice to separate data from the core attributes
[11:30:42] <chilversc_> someprimetime: I prefer to use data- prefix, it guaruntees it will never clash with a future attribute
[11:30:55] <someprimetime> cool good stuff thanks all
[11:31:00] <chilversc_> essentually data- is a resrved namespace
[11:31:11] <Doxin> *essentially
[11:31:15] * Doxin shuts up now
[11:31:16] <chilversc_> if it were xml, you'd just create a custom xmlns for the attribute
[11:40:23] <Whirl3d> would it be difficult to write your own IRC client in javascript? Would it even be possible?
[11:41:19] <Doxin> Whirl3d: unpossible without a translation layer on your server.
[11:42:25] <lancealtar> Whirl3d: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1286527/i-am-looking-for-a-javascript-irc-client
[11:42:58] <Whirl3d> yeah, I read that one lancealtar, went nowhere.
[11:43:11] <Doxin> Whirl3d: I mean, it's possible. freenode has http://webchat.freenode.net which is js I think
[11:43:30] <AL13N> it seems parseXML() (also used by returning ajax calls) has a serious security bug: it seems to parse escaped html...: you can test with: $.parseXML('<?xml ?><root attr="&lt;mail&gt;">text: &lt;bla&gt;</root>') Can anyone confirm?
[11:43:55] <Whirl3d> wow, again AL13N, really?
[11:47:02] <AL13N> Whirl3d: noone seems to answer
[11:48:05] <[fields]> I'm familiar with DOM, and dynamically producing forms.  I am new to jquery.  Is it as simple as writing the HTML for a new form and then overwriting a an existing div's content in jquery?  because that was not the approach with solely DOM.
[11:48:19] <Doxin> [fields]: pretty much
[11:48:25] <[fields]> Doxin:  that is powerful
[11:48:29] <Doxin> [fields]: $("selector").html("new html")
[11:48:50] <[fields]> and "new html" could be a form with validation by javascript and more
[11:49:09] <Doxin> [fields]: sure.
[11:49:20] <[fields]> too cool.  thank you.
[11:49:21] <Doxin> [fields]: try not to dynamically add js though
[11:49:30] <[fields]> ok
[11:50:21] <datarecall> hello
[11:50:54] <[fields]> I've been building a multiple page mobile application.  but for some reason I lose jQuery on like page 4 of the app.  I spent over 5 days trying to figure out why and the best help I got was someone in here's advice to just use 1 page and overwrite divs for all the pages (including forms) that I will need.
[11:51:34] <[fields]> so I will give a shot at building a 5 page app in only 1 page.
[11:52:17] <datarecall> how would you change this: $('#content a[href][title]') to specify #content image titles
[11:52:52] <[fields]> datarecall:  have you tried img[title] ?
[11:53:08] <datarecall> ill give that a shot [fields] thanks
[11:53:20] <ezio> how do i set a callback with a variable.  i don't want the variable to change but the value of it might change outside of the function.
[11:53:25] <warrenparsons> datarecall: Are you trying to change an image title, or look up an image by its title?
[11:53:47] <datarecall> no im going to implement qtip plugin for all images with a certain class
[11:53:56] <datarecall> just didnt know how to build the selector
[11:54:09] <javalover> quick question, i've always used .clone() to clone content from a div...I want to clone an array.....
[11:54:16] <javalover> does it work same way?
[11:55:30] <ezio> why can't i pass a variable to a callback function?  if the variable changes, my function doesn't work
[11:55:55] <javalover> oh I found it this guy says to do this: var newObject = jQuery.extend(true, {}, oldObject);
[11:56:15] <javalover> case anyone was curious: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122102/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-clone-a-javascript-object
[11:56:35] <[fields]> ezio:  I've seen javascript be finicky... and I've used a global variable to get past inabilities to pass variables in callback function calls
[11:56:56] <ezio> [fields], but this is supposed to be a local variable
[11:57:16] <Whirl3d> to clone an array, don't you just have to use var newArray=origArray.slice();
[11:57:29] <[fields]> ezio:  i am new to jquery, so my advice may be poor.  But in my scenario I felt the same way as you.  The only solution I found was to make that variable global.
[11:57:40] <[fields]> therefore you can call the function without needing to pass any vars
[11:57:47] <datarecall> [fields] that worked perfectly thank you]
[11:57:49] <ezio> i want the opposite of that
[11:58:30] <Whirl3d> ezio, what are you trying to do?
[11:59:02] <[fields]> ezio:  well, I never found a way to pass a variable in a simple:   var t = setTimeout("myCallbackFunction()", 3000);
[11:59:14] <ezio> i have a loop which wants to pass an id to each call back, but when the call back comes in it has the last value in the loop iteration
[11:59:24] <NoiseEee> [fields]: if only you had asked for help in such a case.
[11:59:28] <silverwind> jQuery has .proxy for that exact purpose.
[12:00:13] <NoiseEee> ezio: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62
[12:00:22] <silverwind> Also.. never use  a string with setTimeout....
[12:02:45] <int> I have a json data = { 'name' : name }. But the name variable has a ":" character in it and thus it is giving me syntax errors on that line
[12:02:53] <int> how do I handle this?
[12:03:47] <Doxin> int: {'name:blah':name} you mean
[12:03:49] <Doxin> ?
[12:03:59] <silverwind> Shoud work.
[12:04:02] <silverwind> *should
[12:04:06] <elijahma_> json needs double quotes unless you are talking about an object literal
[12:04:06] <ryanneufeld> isn't valid json...
[12:04:16] <ryanneufeld> ^^
[12:04:18] <ryanneufeld> what he said
[12:04:22] <silverwind> ?js JSON.parse("{\"lol:lol\":10}");
[12:04:25] <bot-t> silverwind: {"lol:lol": 10}
[12:04:30] <silverwind> Seems to work fine..
[12:05:27] <ryanneufeld> ?js JSON.parse("{'lol:lol':10}");
[12:05:28] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: SyntaxError: JSON.parse
[12:05:38] <ryanneufeld> ?js {'lol:lol':10};
[12:05:39] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: SyntaxError: invalid label
[12:05:52] <ryanneufeld> ?js {"lol:lol":10};
[12:05:53] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: SyntaxError: invalid label
[12:06:15] <silverwind> ?js ({"lol:lol":10});
[12:06:16] <bot-t> silverwind: {"lol:lol": 10}
[12:06:38] <Doxin> ?js ({'lol\:lol':10});
[12:06:39] <bot-t> Doxin: {"lol:lol": 10}
[12:06:40] <ryanneufeld> tf
[12:06:50] <Doxin> silverwind: there you go.
[12:06:58] <Salvager> is there something like the PHP $_GET superglobal in jQuery?
[12:07:15] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: no
[12:07:23] <ryanneufeld> ?deparam
[12:07:24] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, jQuery.param() - Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[12:07:57] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: try this: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/
[12:09:04] <Salvager> does that retreive the GET values out of an URL?
[12:10:38] <int> nevermind I was doing something wrong.
[12:10:40] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: RTFM
[12:10:54] <ryanneufeld> (Read The Fine Manual)
[12:11:15] <ryanneufeld> ben_alman's plugins pretty well explained.
[12:11:26] <Salvager> ok thanks
[12:11:59] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: and I think you might be confused about what GET really is. All PHP does is parse out the parameters from the URL, Which is what deparam can do
[12:12:28] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: see this: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/?a=1&a=2&a=3&b=4&c=true&d=0
[12:13:04] <hlveheart> Whirl3d, you there?
[12:13:18] <Salvager> yeah it looks great, thanks
[12:13:58] <Whirl3d> yessir, wassup?
[12:14:11] <ryanneufeld> Salvager: NP. Thank ben_alman
[12:14:27] <hlveheart> so, that pagination example you helped me out with works fine in every browser except for IE, where the next/prev buttons don't do anything.
[12:14:38] <hlveheart> Trying to troubleshoot why, but can't figure it out lol
[12:15:04] <Whirl3d> link to the fiddle?
[12:15:24] <hlveheart> one sec, let me update it with the small change i made ^^
[12:15:45] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/Sed5V/10/
[12:16:06] <hlveheart> added     $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 0);   before showPane, so it scrolls to the top of the page
[12:17:02] <Whirl3d> it might be the :visible selector...not sure...lemme try something
[12:17:03] <anew> stupid noob question here http://pastebin.com/3i9sYzya  what would the php statment be for this function to execute success
[12:18:54] <silverwind> echo json_encode(array( "result" => "success")); ? Anyway.. it's not the shitty PHP channel here.
[12:21:00] <anew> array result success
[12:21:19] <warrenparsons> Great success.
[12:21:19] <hlveheart> wib, figured it out
[12:21:27] <hlveheart> Whirl3d**
[12:21:34] <hlveheart> It was the console.log's, IE hates console.log
[12:21:44] <hlveheart> =P
[12:22:47] <shoky> only when the console is closed ;P
[12:23:03] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Sed5V/14/
[12:23:06] <hlveheart> Hey there shoky :P
[12:23:07] <Whirl3d> shoky!
[12:23:13] <shoky> heysss
[12:23:19] <warrenparsons> hlveheart: I use this at the beginning of my first JS file to protect IE from itself http://jsfiddle.net/xmJdZ/
[12:23:31] <nVee> hey guys, I want to do a simple timed fadein fadeout of pictures within a div, can anyone shoot me in the right direction on how to achieve this?
[12:23:54] <hlveheart> Ahh
[12:23:57] <Whirl3d> hiveheart, I used a different way of getting next and previous ids. works better now.
[12:24:03] <shoky> i'd just do console = console || {log:function(){}};
[12:24:05] <hlveheart> Thanks Whirl3d :)
[12:24:12] <hlveheart> and thanks warrenparsons. That'll help
[12:24:53] <Whirl3d> warrenparsons, shoky, thanks for those shortcuts. I wondered how to do that...but I seldom use IE.
[12:25:36] <hlveheart> I'm forced to triple check browser support :(
[12:25:39] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: I've seen other ways of doing the same thing, but most of them involve proxying the console.log and others through another function. I like being able to use the native console methods. YMMV
[12:30:36] <cannjeff> Has anyone had any luck using any file upload plugin with IE7?
[12:31:04] <warrenparsons> Nobody has any luck with IE7.
[12:33:33] <cannjeff> No kidding
[12:33:42] <hlveheart> IE7 is evil
[12:33:45] <cannjeff> But customer regrettable still uses it
[12:34:02] <hlveheart> this is true
[12:34:09] <cannjeff> Though I believe the same issue occurs in IE9 even
[12:34:21] <silverwind> cannjeff, the only good file upload plugins for IE are flash-based..
[12:34:24] <cannjeff> not properly forming multipart requests
[12:34:42] <cannjeff> silverwind thanks
[12:34:42] <silverwind> cannjeff, beside that.. you're stuck with hidden iframes.
[12:34:55] <cannjeff> yeah trying to go hidden iframe route right now
[12:35:12] <anew> http://pastebin.com/Y1bMQqBu  if i return success here, i get the proper result, however if i return nothing i do not get the proper result
[12:35:14] <silverwind> cannjeff, take a look at the jquery iframe transport plugin, it's annotated and all
[12:35:28] <cannjeff> found one link to it, but got the github 404
[12:35:31] <cannjeff> i'll google
[12:35:55] <anew> shouldnt it be if i do not return success it goes to the else in the jq ?
[12:35:59] <anew> why doesn't it do that
[12:36:26] <silverwind> anew, because AJAX is HTTP
[12:36:31] <Whirl3d> simple question: there's no problem using $.load() to load content into a div that has display:"none" is there?
[12:36:48] <anew> silverwind i dont understand
[12:36:55] <silverwind> anew, and HTTP doesn't care about the content of the JSON you return, it only understands "status codes"
[12:37:13] <anew> so how do i trigger the else in this jq ?
[12:37:15] <silverwind> anew, You probably know about 404, right?
[12:37:25] <anew> yes
[12:37:45] <silverwind> anew, It's the HTTP "Resource not found" error.. so in your case, google for a list of http status code..
[12:37:57] <silverwind> anew, and use the PHP "header" function to set it
[12:38:02] <shoky> Whirl3d: not anymore than using .html()
[12:38:21] * hlveheart throws shoky a birthday party
[12:38:32] <shoky> noooo im not 30 yet :\
[12:38:50] <shoky> but thx4gesture
[12:38:55] <silverwind> I'll soon be 30 :'(
[12:39:04] <shoky> december for me ;<
[12:39:07] <warrenparsons> Damn kids..
[12:39:22] <Whirl3d> warrenparsons, amen!
[12:39:27] <anew> use the header function to trigger the else in the jq silverwind ?
[12:39:57] <Whirl3d> it just gets better past 30 if you know what you are doing...
[12:40:22] <warrenparsons> Maybe. I healed quicker at 28 than I do at 38, though. There are tradeoffs.
[12:40:32] <Whirl3d> So, shoky, when's your b-day?
[12:41:17] <Whirl3d> True that, and my eyesight is not as great...did I mention I had all my teeth taken out the other day? LOL So not everything is better...
[12:41:20] <anew> silverwind i used echo json_encode(array('result'=>'success'));
[12:41:26] <shoky> 17/12
[12:41:35] <shoky> or 12/17 for some
[12:41:45] <silverwind> anew, A HTTP header isn't part of the "body" of the response
[12:41:53] <anew> just dont understand why if result is not success why the : is not working
[12:41:54] <Whirl3d> oh, so it's a long ways off...
[12:42:08] <shoky> yes please
[12:42:13] * Whirl3d slaps hiveheart around a bit for the false alarm
[12:42:19] <anew> right... but u are saying i have to return an http response hwere?? i'm lost
[12:43:56] <NoiseEee> anew: "success" as it applies to the logic of your app is very different than receiving a "successful response" from the server.
[12:44:02] <anew> actually i just got it.... i did something totally different...
[12:44:09] <anew> not sure what u meant tho, but i'm sure it was important
[12:44:38] <anew> so i dont understand what http has to do with anything
[12:47:31] <Whirl3d> so here's a weird one: var def=$.Deferred();   var elem=$(".elem").first(); elem.data("defer",def); def.resolve(); console.log(elem.data("defer').state());
[12:47:43] <shoky> ?js $.fn.jquery
[12:47:49] <bot-t> shoky: "1.4.2"
[12:49:50] <shoky> Whirl3d what's weird?
[12:51:02] <shoky> except the "defer'
[12:53:21] <Whirl3d> if I store a varialbe reference like var i=50 in the data object and update 'i' it doesn't update the data object. I wasn't sure if it would for the deferred object.
[12:53:22] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Cqyeu/
[12:55:18] <Whirl3d> I think I'm getting it finally. if I store an object and update the object it works...
[12:55:42] <Whirl3d> so it's resolving the reference (which makes sense now)
[12:57:53] <cannjeff> @silverwind, if I use  the hidden iframe how do i parse on the server side
[12:58:47] <shoky> Whirl3d yah when you copy a reference to an object, you can affect the object's properties using both references
[12:59:42] <shoky> not so with a primitive
[13:06:11] <jaequery> in SVN standard convention, is /trunk, considered PRODUCTION? and development/staging codes will be under /branch/dev and /branch/staging?
[13:06:29] <johnkpaul> jaequery: everything is a convention
[13:06:39] <johnkpaul> your first statement is a very very widely adopted convention
[13:06:42] <johnkpaul> the second, not so much
[13:07:03] <johnkpaul> also, #jquery, not #svn
[13:07:44] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul! how's it goin?
[13:09:07] <johnkpaul> Whirl3d: :) good, but both slowly and busily
[13:09:18] <johnkpaul> I apologize for still not living up to my end of the blog post bargain
[13:09:20] <johnkpaul> how are you doing?

[13:10:07] <Whirl3d> good. No worries about the blog post thing. No obligations here.
[13:12:16] <Whirl3d> okay, that joke completely misses the mark because it's written. it's much harder to distinguish 28-year olds from 20- 8 year olds when spoken.

[13:15:18] <edgar> how do I add a row to an existing table in jquery?

[13:29:24] <evasivx> hey guys
[13:31:44] <francesco_> hello
[13:32:14] <evasivx> i think i have a simple question: How would i get the parent positon and have the secondary navigation nuge over to the left to be beside the logo? http://projectomni.com/granite/
[13:33:28] <francesco_> i am looking for a way to get a string selector of a DOM element i have an <a id="toto">  azermlakze </a> and i would like to get a#toto   you know a jquery magic to get this please ?
[13:35:13] <NoiseEee> are you asking about $('#toto').text() ?
[13:49:00] <AL13N> it seems parseXML() (also used by returning ajax calls) has a serious security bug: it seems to parse escaped html...: you can test with: $.parseXML('<?xml ?><root attr="&lt;mail&gt;">text: &lt;bla&gt;</root>') Can anyone confirm?
[13:49:21] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[13:49:24] <jonathancutrell> Quick question
[13:49:33] <jonathancutrell> is this the right place to ask about handlebars?
[13:49:55] <Whirl3d> Is AL13N a bot or just someone who thinks its cool to post the same question 5 or six times in a row?
[13:49:57] <evasivx> So i have this "$(this).children("ul").css({"margin-left":-$(this).parent().position().left});" how do i make it parents left position plus 110px?
[13:50:20] <Whirl3d> handlebars? The moustache style or ape-hangers?
[13:50:34] <jonathancutrell> Whirl3d: Ha - mustache.
[13:53:03] <AL13N> Whirl3d: i'm not a bot!
[13:53:25] <AL13N> there's just a huge amount of traffic here
[13:53:50] <AL13N> i'm just waiting for when someone is online who knows about this stuff
[13:53:58] <AL13N> or at least answers me
[13:56:19] <Whirl3d> Here is your answer: no. I cannot, nor can anyone else, apparently, confirm or deny your suspicion of a security problem with parseXML. Perhaps you should post to the jquery forums, or stack overflow
[13:57:28] <NoiseEee> AL13N: you're being silly eh
[13:57:55] <NoiseEee> AL13N: what do you expect document.getElementById('someID').innerHTML = '&lt;mail&gt;'  would give you?

[14:26:31] <zsoc> I'm trying to trigger switching a radio button value when a replacement image is clicked, i'm using `$('input.radioButtonImage').click(function() { if(ll(this).attr('src') == 'images/clicked_image.jpg')` to try to detect if the image is showing the 'selected' image or 'unselected' image. I'm using input.radioButtonImage because it's in an <input> and the img class is radioButtonImage. Is that another attr syntax thing?
[14:26:52] <zsoc> leadbywisdom: last time i had to do that I parsed them myself with regex in php, no idea if there's a better way
[14:27:19] <zsoc> leadbywisdom: if you're using wordpress there's also a function that spits the contents of it into a callback for you
[14:31:33] <tw2113> leadbywisdom, if you're trying to grab the contents after the shortcode has been rendered, just hit view source and check for id/classes around the end result
[14:31:43] <tw2113> if you're trying to do that in the editor, dunno
[14:35:30] <cannjeff> has anyone seen something like this http://jsfiddle.net/JrDHt/ when using this https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload in IE
[14:36:27] <cannjeff> So basically what I'm doing is using a button element (that can be styled like the rest of our UI) to trigger the click even on the <input type="file" /> element which to the best of my knowledge cannot be styled beyond its standard shitty look
[14:37:06] <cannjeff> this works in chrome, but in IE it throws some error complaining about access being denied on some script used in the file upload process
[14:37:10] <|s|subsonic> I want to open a modal and have it resize if the window resizes. I'm using $(window).resize(fn...).  Easy enough.  But, when that model closes, I'm guessing the resize event it still attached to the window thus potentially slowing the broswer.  Is this true?  If so, how can I unbind the resize event from the window?
[14:39:03] <zsoc> I can't get `$(".radioButtonImage").click(function() {` to fire.. the tag is `<img ... class="radioButtonImage"` .. Am I misunderstanding something?
[14:40:03] <|s|subsonic> zsoc: I'm guessing you're running into a loading race condition.  Call the code on document ready or after the element has been loaded on the page.
[14:41:25] <RohanBhangui> question:     $("#target").click(function() {}); <-----that will execute a function when something with id target is clicked

[14:48:52] <GeorgeHenrique> Guys, look at my question. I gathered data from a form and sent data to a post request with jquery. I wanted to get the return of this new page and make a new request post. Is this possible?
[14:49:21] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: yes
[14:49:59] <Mr_Tom> Hi. Can I use $('#formID').submit(function(){ etc}); on a form that was loaded into a <div> via a .ajax call?
[14:50:08] <cohitre> Mr_Tom: yes
[14:50:16] <Mr_Tom> Thought as much
[14:50:25] <Mr_Tom> Must be my code is wrong then lol
[14:50:48] <GeorgeHenrique> cohitre can you help-me?
[14:51:10] <eip56> What would be the best way to format data retrieved by $.ajax call from a php script... ie a database query
[14:51:10] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: no
[14:51:17] <eysikal> First time here, let's see what this is all about. Haven't been in IRC for AGES. Like since the 90's
[14:51:23] <GeorgeHenrique> kkkk, ok
[14:51:24] <GeorgeHenrique> :)
[14:51:44] <eysikal> maybe with PHP's json_encode function
[14:52:31] <eysikal> You listening, eip56?
[14:52:53] <eip56> yes thanks eysikal
[14:55:09] <cohitre> Mr_Tom: you may be binding before the element is in the page
[14:55:31] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: you have to handle the callback from the ajax call
[14:55:57] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: you can start your new ajax call inside this callback
[14:57:39] <zsoc> |s|subsonic: I'm actually creating the element immediately before. http://pastebin.com/9jpkp4wU
[14:57:42] <GeorgeHenrique> cohitre, But how can I get information from the return of the first request?
[14:58:03] <cohitre> ? paste @ GeorgeHenrique
[14:58:04] <bot-t> GeorgeHenrique, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[15:01:03] <GeorgeHenrique> cohitre, http://jsfiddle.net/PgGxe/
[15:01:22] <GeorgeHenrique> Kind of hard to explain, but c'mon ...
[15:01:35] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: you are passing an anonymous function to your post call
[15:01:44] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: this anonymous function is your callback
[15:01:48] <eysikal> Can anyone here help with jQuery Ui Dialogs? I'm having a problem with the modal windows - they refuse to close on the iPad.
[15:01:51] <eysikal> Any ideas?
[15:02:06] <|s|subsonic> zsoc: Which versio you using?  I highly suggest .on() (or .delegate()) for something like this.
[15:02:11] <cohitre> the `reposta` variable has the response from the server
[15:02:30] <zsoc> |s|subsonic: instead of .click you mean? jquery 1.7.2
[15:02:34] <cohitre> console.log that
[15:02:58] <|s|subsonic> zsoc: yeah, much faster than binding to each event
[15:03:01] <|s|subsonic> er element
[15:03:18] <zsoc> i would consider that speed wise, but this doesn't actually function at all to begin with
[15:03:34] <zsoc> i have a layer that in theory is over the images, but i have their z-index set below them
[15:03:49] <GeorgeHenrique> cohitre exatly. this response is the page code feed.phtml, ok?
[15:03:54] <|s|subsonic> zsoc: but whatever ll is, it looks like your code it correct.
[15:03:56] <Mr_Tom> cohitre: binding before the content is there? surely the .submit will only work if the #formID is found?
[15:04:10] <cohitre> Mr_Tom: yes
[15:04:17] <zsoc> |s|subsonic: ok thank you, the clicks probably aren't being generated to begin with
[15:04:42] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: it is what you get by calling "/index/feed"
[15:05:00] <subsonic> zsoc: Is ll your namespace for jquery?
[15:05:06] <zsoc> Oh god, it works in IE but not anywhere else. I have never ever had this issue before
[15:05:12] <zsoc> subsonic: yeah ll is the ns, works with all other functions
[15:05:25] <MistuhKurtz> When writing a plugin, I know you can define your default options as something like: $.fn.myPlugin.defaults = { ... }; so that users can override the defaults...but I always see these defaults defined below $.fn.myPlugin = function(){ ... }. Does it have to come after, because of the use of protoype? or can it be placed before the plugin function?
[15:05:33] <Mr_Tom> gotcha. people can only click submit once the content has loaded via the .ajax call, so I presume it's ready. I've tried having it both inside and out of the $document(ready) block
[15:05:39] <GeorgeHenrique> cohitre, exatly, but now what I do ... want to get the value of the #titulo #texto and #categoria and make a new request. understand?
[15:05:46] <subsonic> zsoc: and you know the elements are getting created?
[15:06:07] <zsoc> subsonic: yeah i'm looking at the images on the page. it's hiding the radio buttons and showing the images
[15:06:09] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: you can wrap that response with query $(repost) and use the regular jquery methods on that
[15:06:19] <cohitre> damn you autocorrect.
[15:06:32] <zsoc> subsonic: also, in IE, where it works, they aren't exclusive. Clicking turns them on and off but it doesn't turn the others off when you click one, etc
[15:07:14] <GeorgeHenrique> cohitre, $(resposta).$("#texto").val() ?
[15:08:00] <cohitre> ? find @ GeorgeHenrique
[15:08:01] <bot-t> GeorgeHenrique, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[15:08:14] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: $(reposta).find("clkhvrb")
[15:08:27] <subsonic> zsoc: Well, you're binding a click to each image, you're not looking at the rest of the images to turn them off.
[15:08:42] <zsoc> subsonic: oh, can i use .each for that also, just like how i generate them?
[15:09:52] <subsonic> zsoc: yes.  Put a test case in jfiddle
[15:09:57] <subsonic> http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:10:18] <zsoc> oh that looks fancy
[15:10:43] <subsonic> baiscally copy your js and add some html
[15:10:53] <subsonic> though, images might be a little difficult
[15:11:50] <RohanBhangui> lol people discoveriing jsfiddle lol :D

[15:12:10] <RohanBhangui> is there any way to change a target for jquery ui draggables
[15:12:11] <subsonic> http://ipsumimage.appspot.com/ might be nice for test iamges for you
[15:12:30] <RohanBhangui> for exmaple if i drag a div.main
[15:12:39] <RohanBhangui> then i want to drag any element inside
[15:12:44] <RohanBhangui> let me get a test case
[15:12:49] <subsonic> RohanBhangui: I don't know, I've barely use draggables. :(
[15:12:56] <RohanBhangui> ugh
[15:12:58] <RohanBhangui> okay
[15:13:32] <saba> this is interesting. I've got an element with -moz-transition on the margin, a rule defined in .ready. I'm doing $(elm).css('margin', '10px').addClass('ready') and the margin is animated.
[15:13:38] <saba> any suggestions on avoiding that?
[15:13:47] <zsoc> subsonic: am i doing something really strange? like is this not a think? wanting to use images to change values of radio buttons?
[15:13:52] <saba> same thing with -webkit btw.

[15:15:22] <cohitre> GeorgeHenrique: no
[15:15:42] <RohanBhangui> cohitre any help with my problem
[15:15:43] <subsonic> zsoc: From what it looks like, you want to save a value depending on what's clicked.  If it were me, I'd have the function set up to write the values I needed to a hidden form element depending on which images were clicked.
[15:15:46] <GeorgeHenrique> accentuation
[15:15:50] <cohitre> RohanBhangui: no
[15:15:55] <RohanBhangui> lol
[15:15:57] <GeorgeHenrique> I will try here
[15:16:11] <RohanBhangui> what was that for me or?

[15:19:19] <RohanBhangui> but the body should not be draggable i
[15:19:34] <RohanBhangui> i want, when you drag the body the target for dragging switches to main
[15:19:39] <subsonic> RohanBhangui: You want the element draggable from clicking anywhere in the body?
[15:19:42] <zsoc> subsonic: i think i'm going to break down and use some existing library. thank you for your help :)
[15:19:54] <RohanBhangui> yes

[15:29:26] <RohanBhangui> and then make the main draggable
[15:29:30] <subsonic> RohanBhangui: You might just have to look at window.mousemove

[15:51:02] <eysikal> js is homo?
[15:51:26] <zygote> thank you :) I've been use toFix to round the decimal place but want to understand why its happening
[15:51:36] <imsky> ?js +((0.8+0.4).toFixed(2))
[15:51:39] <bot-t> imsky: 1.2
[15:51:51] <subsonic> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3439040/why-does-adding-two-decimals-in-javascript-produce-a-wrong-result
[15:51:57] <imsky> it's happening because of floating point precision problems
[15:52:06] <imsky> or rather...implementation..
[15:52:15] <imsky> built in problems oh baby
[15:53:01] <subsonic> it's not just JS
[15:53:06] <subsonic> http://floating-point-gui.de/
[15:53:08] <imsky> yeah ietf is everywhere
[15:54:19] <imsky> fwiw zygote, toFixed(8) covers like 99.99% of every case you'll ever have
[15:54:35] <jaequery> subsonic: doesnt happen in php
[15:54:55] <zygote> i see... guess need to read more about it. apparently got to do with binary representation of floating points. will try dig into the details. thanks
[15:55:33] <subsonic> zygote: or just do toFixed or round
[15:55:36] <zsoc> Is there a way to /avoid/ 'this'? Like if I have an .click event function, can i then .each an identifier for all matches EXCEPT the current click element (this) ?
[15:56:21] <jonathancutrell> Quick question about click events
[15:56:22] <shoky> zsoc: you can use .not(this)
[15:56:31] <jonathancutrell> .on() should work like .live() now, should it not?
[15:56:59] <zsoc> shoky: well.. that's just.. obvious. So like $(":radio").not(this).each() ?
[15:57:06] <subsonic> jonathancutrell: It uses event delegation, yes, but diffent syntax
[15:57:07] <shoky> jonathancutrell: $(selector).live(type, fn)  ===  $(document).on(type, selector, fn)
[15:57:33] <jonathancutrell> shoky: yeah - that's what I was messing up.
[15:57:34] <shoky> zsoc: sure, if you need to .each
[15:57:44] <jonathancutrell> shoky: was binding on dynamic element rather than up the dom.
[15:57:55] <zsoc> yes, i need to each all my radio buttons except the one clicked :)
[15:58:04] <shoky> yap that's why live sucks ;p
[15:58:09] <imsky> don't do it the .live way
[15:58:11] <imsky> delegate properly
[15:58:26] <shoky> zsoc: then yep :P
[15:59:04] <subsonic> mmmm event delagation...
[16:01:37] <robert_> so, I need to send a session cookie along with an AJAX request, so the server can track what I've done there; does $.ajax automatically take care of this? Or does the DOM automatically do it, or.. what?
[16:02:08] <shoky> the browser does, methinks
[16:03:00] <subsonic> robert_: a session cookie or just a cookie?
[16:03:53] <robert_> session cookie. I just need the key/value pair and stuff.
[16:04:54] <zsoc> Woot. I have a working custom jquery checkbox with big fancy images. Now if only I can figure out why I can't click on them in firefox and chrome. it's the opposite of every box model problem I've ever had lol.
[16:04:54] <subsonic> You just create a cookie with JS and then check it.
[16:05:05] <someprimetime> i want to optionally replace a string with .replace().. something like var imgSrc = $('#blah').replace('sq-', 'mt-') || $('#blah').replace('sq', 'mt'); but it's not working
[16:06:01] <subsonic> someprimetime: $('#blah').attr('src').replace(....);
[16:06:44] <someprimetime> subsonic: well the selector is just an example
[16:06:46] <subsonic> someprimetime: $('#blah') just makes an element a jQuery object
[16:06:48] <ajpiano> someprimetime: $("#blah").attr("src", function(i, src) { return src.replace(....) });
[16:06:50] <someprimetime> right
[16:07:04] <someprimetime> but it could be either "sq-" or "sq"
[16:07:04] <ajpiano> someprimetime: ^^ will do it iteratively for everything you select
[16:07:11] <ajpiano> someprimetime: write a regular expression :p
[16:07:28] <someprimetime> ajpiano: alright just making sure i wasn't overlooking some other method before using a regex
[16:07:32] <someprimetime> that's usually my last resort
[16:10:42] <nicholasschulz> I want to animate two elements at once; like this::: $(this).$(that).animate({ opacity: 1}, 300); How do i do this?
[16:10:57] <imsky> $([this,that]).animate
[16:11:04] <nicholasschulz> thanks :-)
[16:11:07] <imsky> yw
[16:13:55] <nicholasschulz> Like this? : $(['.viewImage','viewImage_fadeBg']).animate({ opacity:0 }, 200);   get this error:   '4Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined '
[16:14:09] <imsky> err
[16:14:21] <imsky> $(".viewImage, .viewImage_fadeBg") if they're not objects
[16:14:32] <imsky> although
[16:14:47] <imsky> ['.viewImage',.viewImage_fadeBg'].join(",") works too
[16:15:11] <ajpiano> nicholasschulz: $(this).add(that) also works
[16:15:20] <zsoc> Ok now I'm applying id's to my .each'd elements and i need incremented numbers on the end... something like `.each(function( index ){ var incid = index + 1; $(":radio").attr("id", incid)` ?
[16:15:42] <ajpiano> zsoc:
[16:16:18] <ajpiano> $(":radio").attr("id", function(i) { return i++; });
[16:16:29] <imsky> lol
[16:16:33] <zsoc> ah ofc
[16:16:35] <imsky> <input type="radio" id="4">
[16:16:36] <zsoc> ajpiano: thank you muchly :)
[16:16:37] <imsky> yeah
[16:16:38] <nicholasschulz> imsky: thanks :-) works perfect
[16:16:43] <imsky> nicholasschulz, yw again np
[16:16:44] <ajpiano> zsoc: oh right
[16:16:49] <ajpiano> numeric ids are not a good thing
[16:17:06] <zsoc> ajpiano: well... im sure there's a way to contenate the number onto the end of a string?
[16:17:12] <zsoc> *concatenate
[16:17:13] <[fields]> can an id even start with a numeral?
[16:17:19] <ajpiano> $(":radio").attr("id", function(i) { return "foo"+ (i++); });
[16:17:20] <imsky> SURE CAN
[16:17:34] <ajpiano> in html5 they made it ok but it wasn't used to be ok
[16:17:35] <zsoc> now my head hurts, but ok! i'll give it a shot
[16:18:01] <shoky> ++i   no?
[16:18:31] <ajpiano> yea shoky i think you're right
[16:18:42] <shoky> i'd stick with (i+1) :P
[16:18:57] <imsky> postfix and prefix: part 87324982387
[16:19:46] <nicholasschulz> why don't delay work in this line? $('.viewImage, .viewImage_fadeBg').delay(200).hide();
[16:19:50] <nicholasschulz> hide works‚Ä¶.. ?
[16:20:00] <ajpiano> ?delay2 @ nicholasschulz
[16:20:00] <bot-t> nicholasschulz, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[16:20:28] <ajpiano> setTimeout(function() { $(".stuff").hide(); }, 200);
[16:20:28] <gnarf> nicholasschulz: .delay(200).hide(200);
[16:20:33] <ajpiano> or that
[16:20:35] <ajpiano> :p
[16:20:36] <gnarf> it works when hide is an "animation"
[16:20:45] <gnarf> but not when you are giving the "hide now" command
[16:21:20] <gnarf> .delay() only adds a delay in the animation queue, so it doesn't delay everything chained after it like you might expect, only animations.
[16:21:34] <nicholasschulz> thanks gnarl! works perfect. I have to let the div animate to 0 opacity before hide ;-)
[16:21:48] <nicholasschulz> ok, good to know :-)
[16:21:53] <nicholasschulz> gnarl that is.
[16:21:56] <nicholasschulz> gnarf
[16:21:56] <b-ot> nicholasschulz: amazing
[16:22:02] <gnarf> ?fadeToggle
[16:22:02] <bot-t> .fadeToggle([duration], [easing], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[16:22:37] <gnarf> nicholasschulz: consider that ^^^ if you just want opacity from 1->0 + hide() and show() @ 0->1
[16:23:06] <riku-> if I'm using the on - function like $(document).on('click', '.class', function() {
[16:23:17] <nicholasschulz> thanks. its for my 'blog' project when loading picture @ http://bannaky.com/blog/
[16:23:18] <riku-> can I somehow select something like $('input[name="url[]"]').next('div.button')
[16:25:53] <imsky> yeah
[16:27:00] <riku-> oh I got it
[16:27:08] <riku-> .prev + .next
[16:30:00] <[fields]> anyone have experience with jqueryMobile?
[16:30:01] <zsoc> ajpiano: soo... i must have missed something .. `ll(this).attr("id", function() { return "radio"+ (i++); });` is changing the type="radio" to itype="radio" on the last found object lol! The first one works as intended :/
[16:30:33] <ajpiano> uch
[16:30:40] <ajpiano> you didn't include the i argument
[16:31:05] <ajpiano> .attr("id", function(i) { return "radio" + (i+1); });
[16:31:52] <kaidez> [fields] check out #jquerymobile
[16:33:24] <zsoc> ajpiano: sry i did, i left it out when i pasted
[16:33:27] <[fields]> kaidez:  channel is quiet
[16:34:12] <riku-> Has anyone tried the zepto.js?
[16:34:15] <kaidez> [fields] oof.  what's your questions?
[16:34:18] <riku-> http://zeptojs.com/
[16:34:20] <riku-> this one
[16:34:33] <zsoc> hmm... actually now i'm getting unexpected token ')' in $(this).attr('id', function(i) { return 'radio'+ (i+1); });
[16:34:39] <riku-> just wondering is it truely that much lighter than jquery
[16:35:05] <imsky> riku- i have, it's not really a drop-in replacement
[16:35:19] <riku-> oh
[16:35:43] <[fields]> kaidez:  prefer a private message?  basically I'm writing a form to a JS variable, then using jQuery to produce that var using either .html or .appendTo.  This seems to work fine but I lose the jquerymobile styles, and so far it seems like jquerymobile is nothing more than a style thing.
[16:35:54] <imsky> not as far as features, but as far as ie8 breaks when using zepto, riku-
[16:36:19] <riku-> yeah, so it's not for me then
[16:36:30] <imsky> yep i immediately switched to jquery when i saw that
[16:36:39] <riku-> not sure if I need anything faster or lighter than jquery
[16:36:44] <imsky> nope
[16:36:47] <imsky> jquery is the best
[16:36:54] <riku-> thats true
[16:37:06] <riku-> also, it seems like a relatively small project
[16:37:11] <imsky> once you use some micro thing like qwery, bonzo and bean, you'll quickly exceed even the jquery min size
[16:37:59] <zsoc> It's referring to "(i+1)" as  ( is the expected token
[16:39:38] <ajpiano> zsoc: http://jsfiddle.net/WBrku/
[16:40:00] <zsoc> ajpiano: i'll go from there ty
[16:45:12] <zsoc> ajpiano: they are all coming out radio1 :( i am clearly confusing something
[16:45:25] <ajpiano> make a demo that i can see
[16:45:35] <ajpiano> like i gave you somehing you can see to demonstrate that it does wor k:p
[16:46:37] <jimi_> Can someone help me shorten/condense this code? http://jsfiddle.net/TzusY/
[16:47:23] <zsoc> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/UuPDh/ <-- right click on the "result" part and drill down using chrome inspect or firefox firebug.. or even IE f12 :p
[16:48:03] <ajpiano> zsoc: ohh
[16:48:07] <ajpiano> i made an assumption about your code
[16:48:16] <zsoc> ajpiano:  sorry, i should have been clearer
[16:48:40] <ajpiano> i didn't realise you were planning to put that inside of an each anyway
[16:48:49] <zsoc> ah
[16:48:56] <ajpiano> cause the form i wrote assumed you replaced the each
[16:49:03] <zsoc> oic
[16:49:18] <zsoc> i can do that, just still need the if statement that skips over the checked one
[16:49:41] <ajpiano> zsoc: it's fine
[16:49:51] <ajpiano> in your each loop, you also get a free iterator variable there too
[16:50:03] <zsoc> i thought i tried that but i guess i tried it wrong lol
[16:50:33] <ajpiano> ll(":radio").each(function(i) {  ll(this).attr("id", "radio"+(i+1));   });
[16:51:47] <zsoc> http://jsfiddle.net/UuPDh/2/ ? i don't seem to be getting anywhere?
[16:52:31] <zsoc> oh nm
[16:52:33] <zsoc> i didn't fix it lol
[16:54:53] <zsoc> ok now i just feel silly http://jsfiddle.net/UuPDh/3/
[16:58:59] <[N]asser`> I'm experiencing an issue where $.post() works locally but not when I upload the site, could someone point me in the right direction?
[17:00:20] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: can you see the network activity in your console/firebug?
[17:00:26] <zsoc> oh it works
[17:00:31] <zsoc> ajpiano: you are a gentlemen and a scholar
[17:01:07] <[N]asser`> I can actually now that I look
[17:01:36] <[N]asser`> I see where it's posting and getting a 200 OK, but the postback anonymous function isn't being called
[17:02:12] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: do you have a jsfiddle I can look at?
[17:03:12] <[N]asser`> I'm not familiar with what that is...new to js. Looking it up
[17:03:38] <zsoc> ooooooook now it's added checked but not removing it... .attr('checked', 'false'); ? that can't be wrong right?
[17:04:18] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: it is a website to post javascript snippets - there is also jsbin?
[17:05:24] <ajpiano> zsoc: :)
[17:05:30] <ajpiano> zsoc: .prop("checked", false)
[17:05:44] <zsoc> hm.. i'm trying to uncheck a radio button. could that be part of the problem? lol
[17:05:47] <zsoc> .prop, aight
[17:05:49] <[N]asser`> I'm pasting it right now
[17:05:55] <mrcriffis> cool
[17:06:27] <[N]asser`> I'm modifying jRating at the moment
[17:06:40] <[N]asser`> which is what's creating the post
[17:06:42] <coldhead> i'm thinking about poontang
[17:07:04] <rmurphey> what is poontang coldhead ?
[17:07:19] <coldhead> i'm not entirely sure, i suspect it's a region in vietnam
[17:07:22] <zsoc> ok it's apparently just my logic
[17:07:31] <rmurphey> thank you for clearing that up, coldhead
[17:07:49] <coldhead> i'm mostly just enjoying the way it sounds: "pooon... tannnng"
[17:07:49] <[N]asser`> http://pastebin.com/1tDrFTSE there's the post bit
[17:08:26] <[N]asser`> that's being called in a click event. I'm writing out the html for testing since i'm not too familiar with javascript debugging
[17:08:31] <rmurphey> i enjoy the way you sound, coldhead
[17:08:48] * coldhead blushes
[17:09:12] <coldhead> i sound this way because i have a small piece of roast lamb in my mouth
[17:09:31] <coldhead> i'm just trying to see how long it takes to break it down through saliva alone
[17:09:34] <coldhead> 2 years so far
[17:09:45] <RohanBhangui> when you drag a div, is it possible to drag the area insid ehte div?
[17:09:51] <RohanBhangui> the empty space
[17:09:54] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: looking at it now
[17:09:57] <[N]asser`> interesting thing is, when I run it on a local debug server it works just fine. the html is outputted. But when I'm running it on the remote EC2 server, it's not firing it
[17:10:02] <[N]asser`> thanks!
[17:10:05] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/YqBeL/4/
[17:10:12] <RohanBhangui> that is a test case
[17:10:27] <RohanBhangui> where i wnat main the empty space in main to be draggable
[17:11:04] <RohanBhangui> any ideas?
[17:12:15] <zsoc> ajpiano: if you're still in a giving mood: http://jsfiddle.net/DR2Zd/2/ .. you can see the images swap properly on click, and the others swap off.. but the checked property isn't being removed, it adds on click event and just stays there
[17:13:27] <zsoc> sigh, n/m
[17:13:34] <zsoc> attr('checked', false); worked. I had quotes around the false last time
[17:13:35] <zsoc> Thank you all!
[17:14:00] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: what happens when you put a console.log in the top of the callback function?
[17:14:10] <ajpiano> i mean, i can't see anything, cause the images aren't pathed so i don't see the interaction
[17:14:19] <ajpiano> zsoc: you should use is(":checked")
[17:14:23] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: does it get called?
[17:14:25] <ajpiano> to check if it's checked
[17:14:41] <zsoc> ajpiano: oh? is it bad to force it false if it's already not checked?
[17:14:44] <zsoc> i mean it seems to work
[17:15:01] <ajpiano> zsoc: without really poring over this code which i can't do right now
[17:15:02] <[N]asser`> let me check
[17:15:14] <zsoc> ajpiano: np thank you for your help :)
[17:15:19] <ajpiano> i am just guessing you are forcing a particular state that later doesn't pass a check that you assume it will
[17:15:24] <coldhead> i don't follow, RohanBhangui. if you want something other than the <li> to be draggable why don't you make the other thing the draggable element in the first place
[17:15:30] <ajpiano> so jsut step debug your code ;)
[17:15:49] <RohanBhangui> coldhead this is what i wnat to do in the end for which i have thought of multiple ways of doing
[17:16:22] <coldhead> oh good
[17:16:24] <coldhead> ?cc
[17:16:24] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[17:16:36] <RohanBhangui> what i want to do is when i drag the empty space(the grey) i want to instead change the drag target to the rohan li item
[17:16:55] <imsky> CLOASED I SED
[17:17:20] <RohanBhangui> why dont you lsiten before you guys are quick to judge .:(
[17:17:25] <RohanBhangui> >:(
[17:17:32] <imsky> y u mad tho
[17:17:38] <zsoc> why don't you be less picky about free support? :op
[17:17:45] <coldhead> WHY DON'T YOU ALL SHUTUP
[17:17:48] <RohanBhangui> ugh anyways
[17:17:51] <coldhead> WITH YOU INCESSANT PROBLEMS
[17:17:55] <coldhead> AND OPINIONS
[17:17:58] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[17:18:01] <imsky> mental breakdown lol
[17:18:02] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:18:03] <coldhead> thought this was #php
[17:18:07] <RohanBhangui> rofl
[17:18:16] <coldhead> RohanBhangui: do you want to use cloning or something? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2458817/jquery-ui-drag-and-clone-from-original-div-but-keep-clones
[17:18:41] <RohanBhangui> no
[17:18:59] <RohanBhangui> i want to be able to drag any where inside the body and be able to drag the li rohan element
[17:19:02] <RohanBhangui> thats what i wnat to do
[17:19:14] <RohanBhangui> now tell me if im wrong
[17:19:20] <[N]asser`> mrcriffis: it doessn't
[17:19:22] <RohanBhangui> i should make the body
[17:19:24] <RohanBhangui> draggable
[17:19:31] <imsky> wat
[17:19:31] <b-ot> Hi, You may add "ajax history" future to jQuery. Best regards.
[17:19:33] <RohanBhangui> then prevent the default action
[17:19:33] <[N]asser`> again, it does locally, but not remotely
[17:19:39] <mrcriffis> hmm...
[17:19:49] <RohanBhangui> and then make rohan draggable
[17:19:50] <imsky> retard hour is upon us
[17:20:00] <RohanBhangui> is that correct coldhead?
[17:20:07] <RohanBhangui> correct thinking
[17:21:16] <RohanBhangui> coldhead?
[17:21:20] <RohanBhangui> diid he go afk?
[17:21:22] <[N]asser`> This is bugging me lol
[17:21:35] <coldhead> i am just trying to understand what you want to do here, RohanBhangui
[17:21:49] <coldhead> when i do draggable i pick an element and make it draggable
[17:21:55] <coldhead> none of this preventDefault stuff
[17:22:01] <coldhead> so i suspect i don't understand
[17:22:15] <coldhead> would it be easier if you described it in terms of pieces of fruit on a table?
[17:22:20] <RohanBhangui> okay so right now when i drag the rohan lement drags only when you drag rohan item rihgt?
[17:22:25] <coldhead> and we forget about jQuery for a while?
[17:22:30] <RohanBhangui> lol'
[17:22:32] <RohanBhangui> okay
[17:22:38] <RohanBhangui> say i have an apple
[17:22:40] <RohanBhangui> on a table
[17:22:45] <RohanBhangui> to make it fall off
[17:22:53] <coldhead> you shake the table
[17:22:54] <RohanBhangui> i can either push it off
[17:23:08] <RohanBhangui> or incline the the table and make it roll off
[17:23:10] <EyePulp> anyone have a favorite timing module/mechanism for keeping track of client-side activities (.ajax() and other asynchronous behaviors)
[17:23:10] <RohanBhangui> i wnat to incline
[17:23:11] <EyePulp> ?
[17:23:13] <coldhead> $('table').ready()
[17:23:21] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:23:28] <RohanBhangui> can we go back to jquery
[17:23:31] <coldhead> sure
[17:23:35] <coldhead> let's do this, RohanBhangui
[17:23:35] <RohanBhangui> most people might not take to kindly
[17:23:37] <imsky> wtf is inclining a table
[17:23:42] <imsky> in jquery land
[17:23:43] <RohanBhangui> lol no worries
[17:23:49] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:23:55] <RohanBhangui> coldhead suggested using fruits
[17:23:58] <RohanBhangui> newyas
[17:24:00] <RohanBhangui> coldhead
[17:24:10] <RohanBhangui> so currently the rohan element is draggable
[17:24:14] <coldhead> yes
[17:24:16] <RohanBhangui> if i click and drag the rohan item
[17:24:20] <coldhead> yes
[17:24:40] <RohanBhangui> what i wnat to do is be able to drag anywhere in the body and be able to drag rohan item
[17:24:48] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: I think you post data may be bad. Maybe try it without?
[17:25:13] <coldhead> isn't that exactly what you have now, RohanBhangui ?
[17:25:42] <RohanBhangui> no i only have it working for when you drag the mian div or the rohan item
[17:25:43] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: or try quoting your properties "idBox" : idBox
[17:25:48] <RohanBhangui> i wnat to do it for the entire body
[17:25:49] <coldhead> or do you mean you want to be able to click ANYWHERE and have a drag from there apply to the rohan item?
[17:25:55] <RohanBhangui> yes yes
[17:26:06] <coldhead> my god
[17:26:10] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: I don't think it is valid json otherwise
[17:26:12] <coldhead> this is a breakthrough
[17:26:13] <RohanBhangui> i want to click and then drag and that drag should apply to rohan
[17:26:15] <imsky> this is why i charge cash money for advice
[17:26:16] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:26:23] <RohanBhangui> ugh
[17:26:32] <RohanBhangui> im not gonna be charged for this am i?
[17:26:34] <ajpiano> i think we are all learning the important lesson that you don't mess with the rohan
[17:26:34] <RohanBhangui> im broke
[17:26:44] <RohanBhangui> :(
[17:26:50] <ajpiano> sandler tried to warn us
[17:26:53] <RohanBhangui> is that a compliment or insult
[17:26:54] <imsky> you don't talk with the rohan*
[17:26:59] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: also, your server is probably responding with html instead of valid json
[17:27:00] <RohanBhangui> hey no fair
[17:27:01] <coldhead> i don't believe this can be done with native UI draggable, RohanBhangui
[17:27:07] <imsky> yes it can
[17:27:08] <imsky> you suck
[17:27:11] <RohanBhangui> wait why
[17:27:13] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:27:19] <RohanBhangui> this is why i love this channel
[17:27:34] <jimi_> Can someone help me condense this so that I am not using these crazy loops? Preferably removing the php... http://jsfiddle.net/TzusY/
[17:27:36] * coldhead applies imsky liberally to the RohanBhangui element
[17:27:41] <imsky> i feel so
[17:27:42] <imsky> applied
[17:27:46] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:27:50] <RohanBhangui> okay so imsky
[17:27:54] <RohanBhangui> you say its native
[17:28:00] <RohanBhangui> coldhead says toherwise
[17:28:09] <imsky> why don't you restate your problem in clear terms
[17:28:11] <RohanBhangui> what can i do imsky
[17:28:18] <imsky> ^^^^^^^^^ SEE ABOVE PLS
[17:28:19] <[N]asser`> mrcriffis: I'm trying to validate the json right now
[17:28:23] <RohanBhangui> okay
[17:28:30] <[N]asser`> mrcriffis: I'll let you know whether that works or not, thanks
[17:28:51] <coldhead> RohanBhangui: i would work on some native JS to handle a drag event on document and apply the same repositioning to the RohanBhangui element with draggable()
[17:29:02] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: np
[17:29:04] <coldhead> but it is my first day using jQuery, you should do whatever imsky says
[17:29:10] <RohanBhangui> okay will look into it
[17:29:13] <imsky> it's my 2nd
[17:29:21] <coldhead> 100% more expertise
[17:29:24] <imsky> 500%
[17:29:29] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:29:33] <imsky> we get the advanced stuff on day 2 of jquery camp
[17:29:37] <RohanBhangui> okay hold imsky im typing full problem
[17:29:39] <RohanBhangui> in notepad
[17:29:45] <imsky> take your time
[17:29:46] <coldhead> have fun with this, imsky
[17:29:50] <coldhead> it's your special day
[17:30:05] <imsky> not pessimistic enough coldhead
[17:30:06] <imsky> 3/10
[17:30:18] <coldhead> YOU AREN'T THE BOSS OF ME IMSKY
[17:30:22] <RohanBhangui> currently: i drag the border of the .main or click and drag the rohan item and the rohan item moves        what i wnat to do: click anywhere on the screen and drag the rohan item
[17:30:24] <coldhead> i'm being true to myself
[17:30:26] <imsky> YES I AM COLDHEAD
[17:30:30] <imsky> I AM THE BOSS OF SPACE
[17:30:31] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:30:35] <imsky> SPACEBOSS
[17:30:36] <imsky> .com
[17:30:36] <subsonic> So I wrote a very lightweight lightbox (that just takes in HTML).  Other than allowing for more options on initializzation, can anybody see places I can clean this up?  I also like storing elements so it doesn't have to research the DOM. http://jsfiddle.net/3v95s/
[17:31:14] <imsky> RohanBhangui, so you want the rohan item to move immediately to cursor on click?
[17:31:15] <RohanBhangui> imsky ge tit?
[17:31:19] <imsky> BE PATIENT
[17:31:22] <imsky> IM TYPING SHIT
[17:31:24] <RohanBhangui> sry
[17:31:29] <imsky> ANSWER MY QUESTION
[17:31:40] <imsky> coldhead, being space boss has advantages
[17:32:26] <ajpiano> jimi_: put simply, you should just add a class to all these html chunks
[17:32:30] <RohanBhangui> what do oyu mean by move immediately to cursor?
[17:32:38] <tsou> How would I select those ul, such that they have no li.selected inside of them?
[17:32:39] <ajpiano> and do $(".vehicleYear") whatever
[17:32:44] <imsky> RohanBhangui, when you click anywhere on screen, where should the rohan item be?
[17:32:54] <jimi_> ajpiano, i did that.... and i was getting weird results.... let me show you what i tried...
[17:32:56] <imsky> should it stay where it's at and be dragged from the current cursor position
[17:33:00] <imsky> or should it move to the cursor
[17:33:08] <RohanBhangui> when i click and dag anywhere on the screen the rohan item should move
[17:33:12] <[N]asser`> mrcriffis: I found out that it was an invalid json issue. The page it was posting to didn't output valid json (it was putting in html code since it was an asp.net page and I forgot to tell it not to theme it automatically). It works now that I took care of that issue, though I find it strange that it worked locally with invalid json
[17:33:15] <RohanBhangui> rather drag
[17:33:18] <[N]asser`> mrcriffis: thanks again!
[17:33:27] <imsky> RohanBhangui, should it move relative to its original position
[17:33:32] <imsky> or snap to the cursor
[17:33:35] <imsky> not gonna ask a 3rd time
[17:33:42] <RohanBhangui> relative
[17:33:43] <ajpiano> jimi_: and then whereever you're using the php iterator, you would use some information about 'this' to go get the related element
[17:33:48] <mrcriffis> [N]asser`: glad to help!
[17:33:58] <imsky> k RohanBhangui today's your lucky day, i'm gonna set up a jsfiddle
[17:34:06] <RohanBhangui> lol ya
[17:34:10] <RohanBhangui> im never lucky
[17:34:20] <ajpiano> jimi_: i may not be up for a deep dive into this probelm right now
[17:34:20] <jimi_> ajpiano, this is what i was trying using a class.. http://jsfiddle.net/WWhSL/
[17:34:33] <RohanBhangui> do you want me to give you my case again?\
[17:34:37] <RohanBhangui> the fiddle file i created?
[17:34:37] <ajpiano> jimi_: you need to not use global variables
[17:34:46] <ajpiano> jimi_: var id = ...
[17:34:54] <ajpiano> jimi_: will make "id" local to each loop iteration
[17:35:23] <jimi_> oh, i wonder if that was my problem... vehicleyear0 was updating vehiclemake4  lol
[17:35:28] <ajpiano> yep
[17:35:31] <ajpiano> they were all updating the last one
[17:35:36] <ajpiano> cause they all were using the same global reference
[17:36:41] <diverdude> if i have an array X of objects where each object contains another array Y. is there an easy way to find entries where X.Y is an empty array?
[17:37:47] <diverdude> like, X[1].Y may have some content while  X[2].Y may be an empty array
[17:37:48] <coldhead> just let the man work, RohanBhangui
[17:37:57] <RohanBhangui> lol true
[17:37:58] <imsky> coldhead++
[17:38:04] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:38:22] <MistuhKurtz> Hey, is anybody familiar with any other carousel/slideshow plugins similar to this, in that it resizes the images to fit their container? http://johnpatrickgiven.com/jquery/Image-Scale-Carousel/
[17:38:27] <RohanBhangui> coldhead do you usually get easier queries or ...?
[17:38:38] <coldhead> we usually get less incessant questions
[17:38:41] <MistuhKurtz> I think I might use that as the basis for a plugin I'm going to write, I haven't been able to find anything similar
[17:39:15] <coldhead> also yes, you're asking for something unusual. i am really only qualified to suggest people use $(document).ready()
[17:39:26] <RohanBhangui> lol sry to be a bother i feel really bad now.......
[17:39:40] <imsky> np we're all elite ballers here
[17:39:57] <jimi_> ajpiano, ah, you the man.. ok i got it looping on the class, and grabbing the last char for the id
[17:40:13] <jimi_> ajpiano, still probably not the cleanest way though? but at least it gets the php out
[17:40:13] <danzik17> diverdude: yes.  you should be able to do something like $.grep( x, function( item ) { return !item.y.length; })
[17:40:40] <RohanBhangui> imsky: lol
[17:41:06] <danzik17> jimi_: you can also use a data-year attribute in your HTML for this - http://jsfiddle.net/WWhSL/1/
[17:41:07] <ajpiano> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/4QTrF/
[17:41:33] <ajpiano> jimi_: yes it can get neater and neater but getting the php is the biggest part of the battle :p
[17:43:30] <diverdude> thx
[17:44:55] <jimi_> danzik17, what is the data("year") doing?
[17:46:15] <danzik17> jimi_: on your elements, you'd have something like <div class="vehicle-year" data-year='4'>...</div>.  .data() will parse data- attributes for you - see ?data
[17:46:15] <bot-t> jimi_, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:51:57] <imsky> RohanBhangui, stay strong bro
[17:52:08] <RohanBhangui> meaning?
[17:52:26] <imsky> i'm working on it you freeloader
[17:52:44] <coldhead> why don't you get yourself a nice cup of tea while you wait, RohanBhangui
[17:52:47] <RohanBhangui> cause i dont like bothering people i know how i feel when i get bothered so im sry if i end up or have already wasted your time
[17:52:51] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:52:55] <coldhead> and maybe write a poem of thanks for imskers
[17:52:57] <RohanBhangui> good idea
[17:53:04] <RohanBhangui> but i rather be here when imsky finshed
[17:53:07] <RohanBhangui> *finsihes
[17:53:17] <coldhead> that's what my mother was saying last night
[17:53:18] <RohanBhangui> my idea is that if he is taking pain to solve my problem
[17:53:24] <RohanBhangui> the least i can do is be attentive
[17:53:30] <coldhead> good lad
[17:53:34] <RohanBhangui> lol coldhead
[17:54:14] <MistuhKurtz> go forth and help others in the mean time ;)
[17:54:38] <RohanBhangui> lol true
[17:54:58] <RohanBhangui> i have some (basic) knowledge of jquery
[17:55:08] <RohanBhangui> trying to tackle big hoping to understand easier stuff
[17:55:26] <RohanBhangui> im afraid of giving wrong advice
[17:55:44] <MistuhKurtz> eh don't be afraid, just preface it with "I'm not positive, but maybe this will help..."
[17:56:04] <MistuhKurtz> And helping others will ultimately help you gain a stronger understanding of jQuery
[17:56:15] <coldhead> that's what i'm counting on
[17:56:15] * imsky has crashed firefox
[17:56:19] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[17:56:26] <MistuhKurtz> really?
[17:56:45] <MistuhKurtz> I thought I've seen you in here doling out plenty of advice coldhead ?
[17:56:58] <coldhead> you are probably thinking of cloudhead
[17:57:02] <coldhead> he's oldschool
[17:57:20] <MistuhKurtz> Maybe I Just recognize you from another channel. #web perhaps?
[17:57:30] <coldhead> oh yes, that's possible
[17:58:38] <RohanBhangui> ya agreed with MistuhKurtz
[17:58:41] <RohanBhangui> seen you alot around
[17:59:01] <RohanBhangui> i have definitely seen you before
[17:59:03] <RohanBhangui> anyways
[17:59:09] <RohanBhangui> the #jquery
[17:59:14] <RohanBhangui> logs should show everything
[17:59:21] * imsky has crashed firefox again
[17:59:26] <RohanBhangui> lol chrome
[17:59:30] <RohanBhangui> ?
[17:59:35] <imsky> if it crashes firefox
[17:59:37] <RohanBhangui> i hate firefox
[17:59:41] <imsky> I DOUBT IT WAS GONNA WORK FOR YOUR USERS
[17:59:49] <RohanBhangui> lol
[17:59:51] <RohanBhangui> true
[17:59:55] <jonkersjoe> hi I'm confused with the reason why .on was introduced with 1.7 and we shouldn't be using .live. Can .on do the same things .live can do (i.e have the same event handler for new elements that are created )?
[18:00:22] <RohanBhangui> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8042576/whats-the-difference-between-jquery-live-and-on
[18:00:24] <RohanBhangui> try that
[18:01:53] <jonkersjoe> thanks RohanBhangui
[18:02:06] <RohanBhangui> np
[18:02:29] <RohanBhangui> btw anyone using chatzilla?
[18:03:19] <MistuhKurtz> nah
[18:03:27] <MistuhKurtz> Textual on my mac
[18:03:37] <MistuhKurtz> xChat/yChat on my PC at work.
[18:03:41] <coldhead> i used to use chatzilla
[18:03:51] <coldhead> then i moved to IRC in emacs
[18:03:59] <coldhead> so chat looks like work
[18:04:02] <MistuhKurtz> hahaha.
[18:04:28] <MistuhKurtz> yeah my boss has mistaken my IRC for a code editor before...
[18:04:59] <MistuhKurtz> if he tried to say I couldn't use IRC i would vehemently defend its use, but he wouldn't do that :D
[18:05:18] <MistuhKurtz> it might waste a little bit of time but the help gained usually saves more time in the end...
[18:06:19] <RohanBhangui> okay for chatzilla: how do i "ping (message)" people in #jquery wihtout pm
[18:06:30] <RohanBhangui> like what jonkerjoe did to me
[18:06:30] <csantovsky> hey guys, in terms of plugin authoring, how's it possible to define a private method with access to the this keyword? (by "this" I mean the jquery object)
[18:06:45] <MistuhKurtz>  RohanBhangui type /msg user my message
[18:06:51] <RohanBhangui> okay
[18:06:55] <RohanBhangui> so
[18:06:55] <b-ot> RohanBhangui: it possible to, you know, fix it?*
[18:07:08] <RohanBhangui> is this bot real or not
[18:07:18] <RohanBhangui> i am confused
[18:08:01] <MistuhKurtz> I believe a function maps "this" to the context of the current object?
[18:08:21] <RohanBhangui> okay i hae been trying to figure out how to do that
[18:09:26] <MistuhKurtz> csantovsky, http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html
[18:10:37] <RohanBhangui> query MistuhKurtz did this open in #jquery?
[18:10:42] <RohanBhangui> sry
[18:11:18] <MistuhKurtz> csantovsky, usually in plugins I see a variable = this; and then that variable is used to refer to the jQuery object/collection, and can be used inside other functions.
[18:12:36] * imsky keeps crashing firefox
[18:12:50] <csantovsky> MistuhKurtz: actually, the this keyword from within my private method is not the same as the this from the public one
[18:13:22] <csantovsky> let me publish an example of what I'm doing on jsfiddle
[18:13:24] <MistuhKurtz> do you have a git repo? or your code pasted somewhere?
[18:13:27] <MistuhKurtz> k
[18:13:58] <RohanBhangui> MistuhKurtz: did this work
[18:14:19] <MistuhKurtz> RohanBhangui,  well it alerted me that you said something in the channel. it wasn't private.
[18:14:28] <RohanBhangui> ya thats what i want to do
[18:14:31] <RohanBhangui> okay it worked
[18:14:34] <imsky> RohanBhangui, got it working
[18:14:37] <MistuhKurtz> oh well why didn't ya say so? :P
[18:14:37] <RohanBhangui> it alreted and sounded
[18:14:39] <imsky> now to simplify it
[18:14:50] <RohanBhangui> okay still waiting imsky
[18:14:53] <MistuhKurtz> you jus tneed to type their name. You can start typing their name and press "tab" and it will auto-complete.
[18:14:57] <imsky> RohanBhangui, YOU BETTER BE
[18:15:12] <RohanBhangui> at attention sir!
[18:15:20] <imsky> that's more like it
[18:15:31] <RohanBhangui> do you wnat me to drop and give you 50?
[18:15:36] <imsky> give me 500
[18:15:40] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:15:41] <RohanBhangui> sure
[18:15:44] <RohanBhangui> over 10 days
[18:16:05] <imsky> can't believe this
[18:16:08] <RohanBhangui> what?
[18:16:09] <imsky> firefox crashing again
[18:16:14] <imsky> but now from the debugger
[18:16:17] <RohanBhangui> MistuhKurtz
[18:16:19] <imsky> ror
[18:16:26] <RohanBhangui> i have been trying to do that for a while never figured it out
[18:17:06] <RohanBhangui> btw what is in jquery 1.9?
[18:17:09] <RohanBhangui> that is new
[18:17:47] <shoky> RohanBhangui: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/
[18:18:17] <RohanBhangui> ah he is still awake i thought he would respond
[18:18:54] <csantovsky> ok, so this is what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/HWHj3/
[18:19:02] <eip56> so I keep getting a undefined response when i try to access json data via a ajax call. I am obviously not referencing it right. can someone help me out
[18:19:03] <eip56> http://hastebin.com/kamilatawe.coffee
[18:19:35] <jonkersjoe> ok so I've read through the docs, and I kind of understand .on. I've tried to use it in testcase without much success :http://jsfiddle.net/H5mHV/ can anyone help ? It is essentially a bunch of nested divs and I'm using on to add a handler to add and remvoe class based on mouseenter,mouseleave. Also I want to be able to create new elements and have the handler applicable to the new elements that are created.
[18:19:52] <shoky> eip56: dateType
[18:20:34] <eip56> rofl shoky you freaking awesome person you
[18:21:14] <RohanBhangui> jonkerjoe: did you read the jquery api?   http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:22:04] <RohanBhangui> jonkerjoe: why not use button for create new elm
[18:22:05] <shoky> jonkersjoe: check your console
[18:22:22] <jonkersjoe> hi rohan, yeah I did.
[18:22:38] <shoky> jonkersjoe: your html as an error, and you can't put a newline in a javascript string (use \n if you want it there)
[18:22:41] <jonkersjoe> Shoky: I was just checking it, I thinkI've pasted the divs as multiline
[18:22:58] <shoky> jonkersjoe: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/H5mHV/2/
[18:22:58] <csantovsky> I suppose I could pass this as a parameter to my private methods, but I'm not sure this is the best practice
[18:24:12] <imsky> ALL THIS WORK
[18:24:21] <imsky> and it works!
[18:24:36] <MistuhKurtz> csantovsky, no you don't want to pass it as a param
[18:24:38] <jonkersjoe> shoky. great thanks that's working. Hmm‚Ä¶ the event.stoppropagation is not working‚Ä¶
[18:24:43] * imsky crashes firefox
[18:24:53] <MistuhKurtz> csantovsky, just assign a variable like $collection = this; in the immediate scope of your plugin
[18:25:34] <MistuhKurtz> and use the var everywhere you need to reference the jquery collection--i.e., what's returned by $("#target")
[18:25:44] <jonkersjoe> oh I get it now‚Ä¶. damn it
[18:26:06] <MistuhKurtz> you might benefit from a quick refresh on variable scope in javascript :)
[18:26:43] <RohanBhangui> general imsky what part are you at?
[18:26:54] <imsky> RohanBhangui, the part where i prevent it from crashing
[18:27:02] <RohanBhangui> lol okay sir
[18:27:54] <imsky> reaching deep into the nether world of jquery ui
[18:28:53] <shoky> csantovsky: privateRyan.call(this);  if you really want to change the context again. but adding properties to a jq object instance isn't really recommended
[18:28:58] <csantovsky> MistuhKurtz: I considered this approach, the problem is that I would need to declare it in the immediate scope of my closure (i.e. line 2) for it to be visible from my private methods. Also, I'm afraid that the this keyword in the immediate scope of my plugin is different from the one from the each method (since the former might represent a collection of items, given that $('.run') matched multiple elements)
[18:29:13] <jonkersjoe> so with .on its still not handling new elements that are created ?
[18:29:47] <csantovsky> shoky: my bad, in my actual code I use the this.data() method to deal with object-specific variables
[18:29:55] <shoky> jonkersjoe: you're not using event delegation
[18:30:27] <shoky> csantovsky: that's indeed how you should do it, so what good is your fiddle to us ;P
[18:30:48] <jonkersjoe> I thought .on was able to handle event delegates ?
[18:31:00] <shoky> jonkersjoe: you have to read the documentation for .on
[18:31:08] <shoky> why would you just think that
[18:31:48] <shoky> nvm, but read the docs ;p
[18:31:53] <csantovsky> shoky: sorry, I just tried to simplify it :) Nevertheless, I would still need to have access to the this keyword in order to call the data method
[18:32:48] <jonkersjoe> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ because I read that ‚Ä¶ "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the http://api.jquery.com/on method. For earlier versions, however, it remains the most effective means to use event delegation. More information on event binding and delegation is in the http://api.jquery.com/on method."
[18:32:50] <shoky> csantovsky: you always have access to the this keyword, when you say it like that its just confusing
[18:33:11] <coldhead> i am sorry for your struggles, imsky
[18:33:18] <imsky> i'm pushing on resolutely
[18:33:36] <coldhead> no doubt, but it pains me that this is necessary
[18:33:52] <imsky> eat your doritos coldhead
[18:33:57] <RohanBhangui> i can only imagine what you are going through general imsky
[18:33:57] <coldhead> ah, actually it turns out what pains me is carelessly zipping my pants back up
[18:34:02] <coldhead> sorry for the confusion
[18:34:06] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:34:07] <coldhead> so much blood
[18:34:18] <csantovsky> shoky: to be more specific then, the jquery instance this keyword :)
[18:35:44] <shoky> csantovsky: you shouldn't use the 'this' keyword artificially
[18:35:49] <RohanBhangui> oh i thought you meant something else coldhead
[18:35:52] <shoky> it'll only confuse you and anyone reading your code
[18:36:03] <shoky> use the 'this' keyword if you're actually making new object instances
[18:36:43] <jonkersjoe> shoky : ok got it now, I was missing the delegate part in the .on statement
[18:38:32] <imsky> lol i've found so many ways to crash firefox
[18:38:55] <shoky> oh man doritos
[18:39:14] <maslo> hi guys could anyone tell me what plugin the "lightbox-like popup" is on this page: http://livingsocial.com/canada (wait 3 seconds for it to pop up)
[18:39:16] <csantovsky> shoky: I guess I'll follow your tip then. So, no problem passing "this" as argument to privateRyan, right?
[18:39:30] <imsky> chrome doesn't crash >:((((((
[18:39:31] <shoky> csantovsky: nope
[18:39:49] <csantovsky> ok :) thank you very much shoky
[18:40:20] <Goles> How can I  actually get a jQuery callback when the user clicks the button of this form https://gist.github.com/8a412b54a4572229382e
[18:40:29] <imsky> oh crap
[18:40:35] <imsky> i think it was firebug causing the crash
[18:40:39] <imsky> daaaaaaaamn
[18:41:23] <imsky> RohanBhangui, about 5 minutes from delivery
[18:41:39] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:41:48] * imsky can't believe it was firebug
[18:41:51] <RohanBhangui> imsky: yes sir will be ready for extraction sir
[18:41:55] <csantovsky> Goles: $('#purse-buy-btn').submit(function(){...}) ?
[18:41:56] <imsky> u betrayed me firebug
[18:42:05] <Goles> csantovsky thanks mate :)
[18:42:14] <Goles> will try that out

[18:44:18] <imsky> u being fresh with me boy
[18:44:25] <imsky> i'll put you in a pizza oven
[18:44:40] <RohanBhangui> no sir
[18:45:04] <RohanBhangui> i love these charades
[18:45:41] <shoky> imsky he said you're pretending
[18:45:52] <imsky> i think his english is not so good
[18:46:07] <imsky> at least it won't be after i put make him eat his own foot
[18:46:15] <imsky> and put make him forget grammar rules
[18:46:40] <shoky> and put make up on him
[18:46:44] <RohanBhangui> lol shoky has had xp with my bad grammar
[18:46:49] <RohanBhangui> im much better at speaking

[18:49:14] <imsky> RohanBhangui, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/8HtWt/
[18:49:56] <RohanBhangui> imsky: you are officially my new god
[18:50:10] <RohanBhangui> can you explain if ts not too much trouble how you idd it
[18:50:22] <imsky> it's 3 lines of code RohanBhangui
[18:50:27] <imsky> what's there to explain really
[18:50:40] <RohanBhangui> i knw but what is all the e. stuff
[18:50:40] <imsky> I JUST KEPT CRASHING FIREFOX UNTIL IT WORKED
[18:50:43] <shoky> nice imsky
[18:50:51] <RohanBhangui> persistence acheivement
[18:51:12] <RohanBhangui> but ya what is the e. stuff
[18:51:21] <shoky> e is the argument to the mousedown handler
[18:51:21] <RohanBhangui> and what does dispatch event do
[18:51:27] <shoky> it's the event object
[18:51:27] <imsky> jsfiddle's being a dick, go here: http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/DGLa9/
[18:51:48] <imsky> ok so here's what i gleaned from my crash experiences
[18:51:57] <RohanBhangui> ya
[18:52:00] <shoky> aren't those 2 identical
[18:52:14] <shoky> ah nvm
[18:52:14] <imsky> you _almost_ can do this by doing $("#container").mousedown(function(e){$("#item").trigger(e)})
[18:52:23] <imsky> but it doesn't work, not as smooth
[18:52:27] <imsky> so RohanBhangui
[18:52:35] <imsky> thx coldhead bb
[18:52:40] <coldhead> you excellent, imsky
[18:52:52] <RohanBhangui> what did hedo?
[18:53:14] <coldhead> he fixed your stupid problem, RohanBhangui
[18:53:23] <RohanBhangui> no what did coldhead do to imsky
[18:53:24] <coldhead> all glory to the hypnoimsky
[18:53:29] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:53:35] <imsky> so the long and short of it is, this is all DOM code. you create a MouseEvent, you merge its settings with the original mousedown, and then you dispatch it, all in DOM
[18:53:45] <shoky> lol@not as smooth
[18:53:49] <coldhead> also he did it in the way i suggested :)
[18:53:49] <RohanBhangui> okay
[18:53:54] <coldhead> except much sexier
[18:53:57] <imsky> shoky u mad breh?
[18:54:01] <RohanBhangui> lol
[18:54:02] <coldhead> all this dispatch
[18:54:06] <shoky> nah im on chrome :D
[18:54:16] <imsky> shoky u mad tho
[18:54:27] <shoky> no, should i be?
[18:54:39] <imsky> u talk like ur mad
[18:54:51] <shoky> how u figure dat

[19:02:42] <Goles> csantovsky yeah I think I identified the issue :) thanks!

[19:43:41] <coldhead> you COULD just save an empty fiddle with the settings you like and start from there whenever you need a fresh fiddle
[19:43:53] <chee> ya rite
[19:43:55] <coldhead> or you could bug the authors about it :)
[19:43:59] <chee> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/TCgbq/
[19:44:01] <chee> bookmark that rite
[19:44:21] <chee> then you'll always have a jQuiddle
[19:48:12] <jrockjiggz> chee: good until I hit save/update ;)
[19:48:41] <chee> jrockjiggz: no sir! that link will always be a blank one !
[19:48:54] <jrockjiggz> jQuiddle it is!
[19:49:04] <chee> then when you save it'll be like http://jsfiddle.net/TCgbq/2 or http://jsfiddle.net/TCgbq/3 that is the updated version !
[19:49:14] <chee> jQuiddle it is !
[19:49:15] <jrockjiggz> btw, anyone know a tool to quickly investiage HTML structure to find where I might be missing a closing tag?

[19:54:18] <shoky> ah
[19:54:20] <shoky> i wish
[19:54:41] <imsky> all this weird world of licensing is perplexin me
[19:55:13] <csantovsky> this is rather common among researchers
[19:55:25] <csantovsky> at least in the robotics/computer vision fields
[19:55:48] <imsky> i'm looking at an lgpl project that has been commercialized 4 years ago
[19:55:53] <TomWij> Yeah, you've got to put an eye out for licensing. Pick the wrong one and you lock yourself too much or open it up too much.
[19:55:54] <imsky> got access to the source..WAT DO?
[19:56:23] <TomWij> They're often not hard to understand though...
[19:56:37] <TomWij> At least they're not as long as all those typical licenses. >_<
[19:57:41] <TomWij> If you're in doubt... http://quickmediasolutions.com/unicorn
[19:57:57] <imsky> TomWij, that's not my problem
[19:58:09] <imsky> looking at a project that's been commercialized by its authors
[19:58:24] <shoky> wat wat wat, no more unicorn torture??
[19:58:24] <b-ot> when you click a image it move a list up .. how can I make this but while the image is push .. while they wont let go of the press in?
[19:58:37] <shoky> wat
[19:58:37] <b-ot> How can i use this to select from which element the function was called?
[19:58:43] <jrockjiggz> shoky: jqfiddle ;) ty!
[19:58:47] <csantovsky> sorry, looking at=looking for or taking care of?
[19:59:08] <imsky> no, found it, have the .cpp files, wondering what the legalities are
[20:00:04] <csantovsky> under what licence was it distributed?
[20:00:09] <imsky> lgpl
[20:00:10] <TomWij> The license you found with the source counts, anyone (if open, ofc) could take it and derive it into a more strict license...
[20:00:13] <shoky> a wat b
[20:00:13] <b-ot> I am having a jsp that contains a jquery tab and inside tab i am having a custom search component on clicking the component a grid will open and it will act as an overlay and i used this plugin to close the grid if the user clicks outside the gridis working perfectly in all other element click other than jquery tab selection component
[20:00:19] <shoky> :\ that's just dumb
[20:00:36] <shoky> as much as i love WAT.json
[20:01:07] <TomWij> And only the author can make it more loose. A lot of people start out with GPL and go more open to MIT, for example...
[20:01:35] <imsky> TomWij, the authors here are a big deal. they sell this tech to google, microsoft, etc
[20:01:40] <csantovsky> as far as I'm concerned, you might use it as an external lib and distribute it with your project, but it must be lgpl opensource (although your specific code that uses it doesn't have to)
[20:02:22] <TomWij> imsky: True, but you are provided this code with that license. It would make no sense reaching _that_ out to you and later telling that what you read is no longer true...
[20:02:48] <TomWij> If that where the case I could go and change to something super restrictive and blame everyone for forking me.
[20:02:48] <imsky> so complicated mang
[20:03:26] <TomWij> I think... When in doubt, contact a lawyer.
[20:03:39] <imsky> time for a clean room implementation!
[20:03:57] <TomWij> Especially when dealing with top business company code.
[20:04:42] * TomWij 's actually wondering if there are any #legal / #licensing channels here.
[20:05:18] <csantovsky> #lgpl I guess? rs
[20:05:33] <coldhead> #fsf
[20:07:03] <imsky> lol i'm running 2008 code over hear
[20:10:27] <csantovsky> I once tried to compile some 2003 cpp code... that's when I learned that c++ has changed over time
[20:11:16] * black_warlock gnight peeps
[20:11:30] <imsky> later
[20:17:18] <imsky> hmm let's see
[20:17:22] <imsky> who are the minorities in this chan
[20:17:52] <tash> can you make a jquery variable have a specific background color without using a selector?  like, if var number = -25;  I want to make -25 be red or have a red background to make it stick out...but right now I'm only doing a .html() on an element and putting the number var in the .html()
[20:18:42] <tash> so, I don't really have any way to select it like $( '#blah' ) or $( '.blah' )
[20:18:45] <jrockjiggz> tash: what?
[20:18:51] <imsky> tash is this in a table or something
[20:18:58] <imsky> coldhead we must give voices to the oppressed
[20:19:06] <jrockjiggz> tash: variables cannot have backgrounds. they are code.
[20:19:15] <imsky> the Qs of #jquery shall be heard!!!!
[20:19:56] <imsky> don't waste this opportunity guys
[20:19:59] <jrockjiggz> tash: do you mean, highlight the var in your ide?
[20:20:09] <tash> yes, basically highlight it
[20:20:15] <tash> .css() maybe?
[20:20:18] <jrockjiggz> what program do you use?
[20:20:18] <tash> I just stumbled upon that.
[20:20:27] <jrockjiggz> i'm so confused...
[20:20:32] <shoky> tash .css() or .addClass() ..
[20:20:49] <shoky> tash best to have a css class for it and addClass() when you want to
[20:20:53] <tash> shoky: thx, I'm trying .css() now
[20:20:58] <tash> ok
[20:21:02] <shoky> that works fine too
[20:21:15] <tash> appreciate it, bbiab to let you know how it goes.
[20:25:06] <tash> I guess that won't work will it...hmm
[20:26:06] <tash> http://pastebin.com/KaNtA2u1
[20:26:20] <tash> please ignore that pastie
[20:26:22] <shoky> nah not like that
[20:26:23] <shoky> o
[20:26:50] <shoky> you can't addClass or css or call any jq method on a simple variable.. only on jq objects
[20:26:50] <tash> this is what I meant to pastebin: http://pastebin.com/5xPVM8WA
[20:27:08] <tash> if totalHoursRemaining ends up being negative, I want it to be highlighted in red
[20:28:54] <tash> yeah, that's what I was getting after, shoky, I didn't think so, but was just curious.
[20:30:14] <shoky> if you want only the -25 part to be red, you need to put it in a <span>
[20:30:34] <shoky> otherwise, addClass to $('#hours-remaining')

[21:00:33] <Dylan_Hsu> beware of twitter bootstrap gentlemen
[21:10:36] <azbyin> hi all.. how does one block or put execution in a wait state?
[21:11:00] <shoky> azbyin: why do you wanna block?
[21:12:00] <azbyin> i have $("#myel").animate({....}, 1000, function() { alert("finished animate"); }); alert("finished??")
[21:12:21] <shoky> alert blocks btw.
[21:12:30] <azbyin> alert was an example
[21:12:36] <shoky> i dont understand the problem
[21:12:38] <azbyin> i am doing some other stuff instead
[21:13:42] <shoky> what's wrong with putting it in the callback like you did?
[21:14:17] <azbyin> yes, putting it there works, except it executes whatever follows immediately
[21:14:26] <shoky> yes, why is that a problem
[21:14:41] <shoky> if you want something to happen when animation is complete, thats what the animation complete callback is for
[21:15:04] <azbyin> eg: i have an <img> that has an image inside. this el is now moved to a different location and once there, something happens
[21:15:28] <azbyin> and then it will move to another location and again once it reaches there, something will happen
[21:15:32] <azbyin> and so on
[21:15:53] <azbyin> so, you see i will keep adding my stuff into the callback of the callback of the callback...
[21:16:05] <azbyin> it will get very messy and difficult to edit/maintain
[21:16:10] <shoky> you understand that blocking or 'putting execution in a wait state' means your animation won't even run..
[21:16:13] <shoky> ?
[21:17:02] <shoky> you want to queue animations for the same element?
[21:17:10] <azbyin> sure, but i want to 'wait' until the animation has finished
[21:17:18] <shoky> just call animate again..
[21:17:35] <azbyin> but what if there was something else i had to do?
[21:17:43] <shoky> then you'd do it in the callback
[21:18:24] <ColKurtz> azbyin you could organize all your methods in an object, and instead of using anonymous callbacks just call the method name
[21:18:33] <ColKurtz> that would clean it up a bit.
[21:18:42] <shoky> also using promises
[21:18:54] <azbyin> using 'promises' ?
[21:19:00] <azbyin> what are these?
[21:21:01] <shoky> azbyin:  you can do  var animPromise = $('#myel').animate(....).promise();   /* then later on */   animPromise.done( function(){ doSomeShit() } )
[21:21:21] <shoky> it's another neater way to add "complete" callbacks to the animation
[21:21:45] <ColKurtz> it's magic!
[21:22:00] <azbyin> great.
[21:22:27] <azbyin> now, this one prolly doesn;t have an answer: is there a way to 'open' a select dropdown ?
[21:24:16] <ColKurtz> well azbyin if you use a plugin to replace the dropdown with other elements so that you can style it however you like, yes it would have a method to open it up
[21:24:47] <ColKurtz> idk about a regular <select> element though, I'm inclined to think not.
[21:25:40] <shoky> not possible afaik
[21:29:06] <ColKurtz> like this plugin, it has an open method: https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/blob/selectmenu/ui/jquery.ui.selectmenu.js
[21:29:21] <ColKurtz> idk if the method is public, though.
[21:30:24] <azbyin> https://github.com/lgr/jquery-dropdown-select  <- this one?
[21:30:45] <shoky> there are many..
[21:30:53] <ColKurtz> probably
[21:31:05] <ColKurtz> just look in the docs or source code for a public "open" method
[21:31:14] <ColKurtz> you know what I mean by public?
[21:31:52] <ColKurtz> Well I guess even if there isn't a public open method, you could still just do $("select").click(); to trigger it
[21:32:11] <ColKurtz> better to use the public's open() though if available
[21:32:28] <azbyin> the url i gave just now have an open method
[21:33:10] <ColKurtz> then that'll do, pig, that'll do
[21:33:11] <ColKurtz> :3
[21:40:46] <coldhead> IN THE KITCHEN / WHISKEY DRUNK / I PRAY TO SOMEONE ELSE'S GOD / THAT YOU'LL KEEP QUIET
[21:41:58] <azbyin> guys, i'm not convinced the animate issue is solved for me.
[21:42:30] <azbyin> as i was saying, i think the only way to get it right will be to put the next animation within the callback of the previous one
[21:42:45] <azbyin> and i have a lot of these to do
[21:46:06] <ColKurtz> azbyin as I mentioned you can organize all your functions in an object and then just reference the function name in your callbacks instead of a big mess of anon functions
[21:47:39] <azbyin> ColKurtz, http://jsfiddle.net/shSLy/
[21:48:04] <azbyin> see there, the second animation starts playing before the first console.log loop has finished
[21:49:44] <azbyin> so now i am going to be stuck doing this:  $("#el").animate({..}, 1000, function() { ... $("#el").animate({...},2000,function(){...}) });
[21:49:46] <ColKurtz> azbyin could you please clean it up so that it executes
[21:50:00] <ColKurtz> I get an error saying g$("#fakecur") is null
[21:50:15] <azbyin> ofcourse, only some of the js is available there!
[21:50:26] <azbyin> the html and css parts are blank obviously!
[21:50:30] <coldhead> working demos or gtfo
[21:50:33] <azbyin> if you want i can fill them up
[21:50:38] <azbyin> ok, i will add them
[21:51:26] <vl1234> Gud Morning

[21:53:30] <azbyin> ColKurtz, link updated above ^^
[21:53:38] <coldhead> thanks azbyin
[21:55:42] <azbyin> anyway, i cannot see any other way to do it than what i wrote above in the channel
[21:56:02] <azbyin> i.e. all the animates need to go into the callbacks of the parent/previous animates
[21:56:41] <vl1234> @coldhead......thats great and thankzzzzzzzzzz a lot
[21:57:04] <shoky> azbyin: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/shSLy/3/
[21:58:25] <shoky> that's the first thing i told you to do
[22:00:00] <Kazii> Hi o/
[22:00:06] <Kazii> Can we post links ?
[22:00:13] <shoky> we can
[22:00:33] <shoky> unless it's 100 of them
[22:00:52] <Kazii> Anyone know if the funky flash slider at the bottom of http://www.objectifnc.com/ can be made *easily* in jquery ?
[22:01:39] <shoky> on the bottom?
[22:01:50] <Kazii> yep
[22:03:00] <shoky> i dont really understand what it's doing. shifting right, and also one image is replaced?
[22:03:41] <mershed> hi all, i am getting a really weird behaviour with dynamically created images
[22:03:47] <mershed> using jquery 1.7.1
[22:03:56] <mershed> if i do this in a console
[22:04:07] <mershed> var img = $("<img src='/images/uploads/projects/al_01.jpg' />");
[22:04:17] <mershed> and then look at my net panel in firebug
[22:04:22] <mershed> the image starts loading
[22:04:30] <mershed> even though i havent appended the new element to anything
[22:04:32] <mershed> wtf???
[22:04:36] <shoky> Kazii it shouldn't be too hard. depends how easy you mean by *easily*
[22:05:14] <Kazii> I think it's replacing randomly to a given maximum but the tricky part i cant seem to figure out is never using the same image twice in the line, oh and I'm very green when it comes to anything jquery :(
[22:05:41] <mershed> its the same with ajax - when i convert an ajax response in the success function - like so $(data),
[22:06:01] <mershed> all the images in the ajax html start loading before i append the new content to the dom
[22:06:05] <mershed> this makes no sense
[22:06:10] <mershed> and makes preloading impossible
[22:06:28] <mershed> do all browsers do this? start loading imgs even if they arent in the dom?
[22:06:45] <shoky> Kazii: what do you mean, it never uses the same image twice?
[22:06:46] <RPkS> Guys I'm having a problem getting a jcarousel to display correctly in IE8 & 9 ...oddly enough it works fine in 7. Go figure
[22:07:30] <shoky> mershed: if the browser wants to, ynot
[22:07:52] <mershed> im tryin to preload images for content that is ajaxed in
[22:08:02] <shoky> mershed: and what do you mean it makes preloading impossible? it *is* preloading, in action
[22:08:21] <mershed> no, preloaing using the .load() callback
[22:08:26] <vl1234> @coldhead......location.reload(); here location means What?
[22:08:27] <azbyin> shoky, that is (almost)the same as what i mentioned on the channel here
[22:08:29] <azbyin> i'll repaste
[22:08:35] <mershed> to not display images till they are actually fully loaded
[22:08:36] <azbyin> so now i am going to be stuck doing this:  $("#el").animate({..}, 1000, function() { ... $("#el").animate({...},2000,function(){...}) });
[22:08:37] <mershed> then fade in
[22:08:52] <coldhead> ?mdc location @ vl1234
[22:08:53] <bot-t> vl1234, window.location - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[22:09:00] <azbyin> except you did chaining and i explicitly added it to the callback itself
[22:09:02] <Kazii> @shoky Well the flash version is cycling through about 12 images, and the line displayes 6 at a time, and never displayes the same image twice in the selected 6.
[22:09:08] <shoky> azbyin: and the second thing i told you is if you want something to happen on completion, that's what the complete callback is for. and we gave you suggestions on how to make it a bit neater
[22:09:17] <mershed> the idea is when you ajax in a new page fragment, to attach a .load event to the images and load them sequentially
[22:09:24] <RPkS> I have a link if someone can take a look
[22:09:38] <mershed> but if the browser starts loading them all immediately, even before the new ajax fragment is inserted in the dom
[22:09:48] <mershed> then i cant control the load order
[22:09:50] <azbyin> shoky, it still has the issue of *anything* that is following the first animate will get executed
[22:10:21] <shoky> azbyin: that is because the animation is asynchronous..
[22:10:28] <shoky> azbyin: it's not a problem
[22:10:36] <azbyin> and that is exactly what i was asking about!
[22:10:49] <azbyin> i.e. some wait/waitFor state (if available)
[22:10:55] <shoky> man.
[22:11:09] <shoky> use the callback
[22:11:40] <shoky> or hell, use setTimeout if you want to be sloppy
[22:13:07] <azbyin> yeah i will either put everything in the callback(s) or simply do what you did and chain the animates
[22:13:21] <shoky> azbyin: if you don't want the browser to preload, don't make elements/image objects pointing to your image urls
[22:13:44] <mershed> was that meant for me?
[22:13:48] <shoky> oops yeah
[22:13:51] <azbyin> it has nothing to do with preloading unfortunately
[22:13:55] <azbyin> ah, ok :)
[22:14:02] <mershed> ok that doesnt make sense
[22:14:17] <mershed> im using ajax on top of a static site
[22:14:27] <shoky> mershed: set their 'src' attribute only when you've done your custom preloading
[22:15:01] <mershed> ok but as im saying, the same url will serve up a different thing depending on if your hitting it via http or ajax
[22:15:08] <shoky> wait, attach a .load event to the images, for loading them sequentially, huh?
[22:15:16] <mershed> thats what im doing
[22:15:21] <mershed> you dont seem to understand me
[22:15:32] <mershed> if i have an $.ajax call
[22:15:34] <azbyin> also, could you give me an example of using the promise? i saw your earlier example, but what are the args to animate?  var prom = $("#el").animate({ left:100}, 1000).promise();  prom.done(function{ ...}); ?
[22:15:36] <mershed> and it returns this
[22:15:47] <mershed> "<img src='test.jpg' />
[22:15:49] <mershed> "
[22:15:53] <mershed> and then i take that response
[22:16:03] <mershed> and in jquery merely convert it to a jquery object
[22:16:04] * bencahill spent an hour only to figure out that $.get now doesn't take an object with objects (it needs arrays) for parameters. :eyeroll:
[22:16:20] <mershed> eg $("<img src='test.jpg' />")
[22:16:28] <mershed> that img will start loading
[22:16:33] <shoky> mershed: a jquery object wraps an element object (usually)
[22:16:35] <mershed> its never been added to the actual page
[22:16:42] <coldhead> ouch, sorry bencahill
[22:16:48] <mershed> cmon man , you know you can use strings to create new elements
[22:16:48] <coldhead> you'll know for next time :P
[22:16:53] <bencahill> hehe
[22:17:15] <mershed> if i havent added the newly created element to the dom, just created it with jquery and stored it in a var
[22:17:22] <shoky> mershed: of course.. but as soon as you do $('<img src="test.jpg"/>")  jquery creates a new img element object
[22:17:25] <bencahill> coldhead: Well, I'm still happy that that is the only thing that broke going from 1.4.3 to 1.7.2 ;-)
[22:17:26] <mershed> yes
[22:17:34] <mershed> but doesnt add it
[22:17:39] <mershed> you have to append() after that
[22:17:45] <mershed> so if its not anywhere in the body
[22:17:48] <mershed> why is it loading
[22:18:01] <mershed> i dont know how to explain this any more clearly
[22:18:17] <mershed> until its in the dom, its just stored in memory
[22:18:19] <mershed> its not visible
[22:18:23] <bencahill> Good night all; I've got a busy rest of the week!
[22:18:30] <mershed> so explain why it starts to lad?
[22:18:32] <mershed> *load
[22:18:46] <azbyin> mershed, you mean 'it gets the data from the server' by 'starts to load', right?
[22:18:59] <mershed> yes, it actually requests test.jpg
[22:19:01] <azbyin> if yes, it is client(browser) specific behaviour
[22:19:02] <shoky> mershed: because a new image element is created, so the browser goes to fetch it, regardless of if its in the page's DOM tree or not
[22:19:17] <mershed> well thats just great
[22:19:19] <vl1234> hi Guys.......... i want to learn regex jquery......can any 1 refer me a gud websites and materials also................
[22:19:20] <azbyin> client can decide when to fetch
[22:19:25] <shoky> just like if you do: var img = new Image(); img.src = 'bla.jpg';
[22:19:37] <mershed> so i have to do string replaces on the ajax fragment
[22:19:48] <mershed> then convert it to an element
[22:19:54] <mershed> far out
[22:20:25] <mershed> so there is literally no clean, simple way, to strip srcs of a bunch of imgs and then sequentially load them
[22:20:40] <mershed> if they exist as img nodes, in the dom or not, they will start to load immediately
[22:20:58] <mershed> and there doesnt seem to be a good way to cancel loads either
[22:21:01] <mershed> from what i see
[22:21:08] <shoky> if your ajax gives you single img elements like <img src="test.jpg"/>
[22:21:11] <mershed> removing the elements doesnt stop the load
[22:21:15] <mershed> no it gives me a page
[22:21:21] <mershed> with loads of images
[22:21:27] <mershed> just no header/footer
[22:21:47] <shoky> yah.. donno what you can do there besides parsing it
[22:21:52] <mershed> god
[22:22:04] <mershed> i love jquery
[22:22:15] <shoky> jquery is not a string processing lib.
[22:22:17] <mershed> but javascript/ajax is still retarded
[22:22:33] <mershed> its handling of loading is useless
[22:22:41] <shoky> it has nothing to do with jquery
[22:22:43] <mershed> no percentages
[22:22:44] <mershed> i know
[22:22:50] <mershed> im saying i love jquery
[22:22:56] <mershed> but the underlying technology sucks
[22:23:00] <shoky> and it has nothing to do with javascript/ajax
[22:23:07] <mershed> well, browsers then
[22:23:12] <mershed> however you want to frame it
[22:23:22] <mershed> for any serious control of what you load and how you load it
[22:23:25] <mershed> js/ajax stinks
[22:23:37] <mershed> i cant even seem to cancel loads
[22:23:38] <shoky> for serious control, you'd have your ajax give you the urls
[22:23:47] <shoky> and then you dont have to parse anything
[22:23:48] <coldhead> for serious control use a native app
[22:24:09] <mershed> im just trying to make a smooth, sexy portfolio site jesus
[22:24:25] <mershed> as much as i hate to say this, i wish i could use flash
[22:24:44] <shoky> yeah blame the platform because you don't know it
[22:24:48] <mershed> if i cant cancel loads, and i cant stop the browser from loading every img it gets its grubby mitts on
[22:24:51] <mershed> how is that my fault???
[22:25:08] <mershed> id think the option to stop laoding and img
[22:25:13] <mershed> if its removed from the dom
[22:25:22] <mershed> or NOT load imgs until they are actually on screen
[22:25:25] <mershed> would make sense
[22:25:39] <mershed> im blaming the platform BECAUSE i know its limitations
[22:25:46] <mershed> or is there a way around it?
[22:25:54] <shoky> have your ajax give you the urls
[22:26:14] <mershed> so, if it contains a large page fragment
[22:26:24] <mershed> with text, lists, imgs, the lot
[22:26:38] <mershed> are you saying i should render a script tag into it
[22:26:43] <mershed> or something like that
[22:26:48] <shoky> then your ajax server API does not suit your client side needs
[22:27:11] <mershed> ok how should it work then
[22:27:16] <shoky> render a script tag into it? donno what that means
[22:27:20] <mershed> i have a site with a static header and footer
[22:27:21] <shoky> (and i dont think i meant anything like that)
[22:27:36] <mershed> the content area needs to load different pages thru ajax
[22:27:45] <mershed> but the whole site also needs to be static html as well
[22:27:52] <mershed> if js is off, all the links work as actual pages
[22:28:05] <mershed> so each URL serves 2 ways - a full page, or just the content if the request is ajax
[22:28:14] <mershed> its an elegant clean way to do it
[22:28:21] <shoky> btw - i'm not 100% sure that there is not SOME way to prevent the browser from loading those images for you.. but i dont know of one
[22:28:47] <mershed> ive tried a lot of things
[22:28:51] <mershed> removing the images
[22:28:57] <mershed> replacing src with ""
[22:29:03] <mershed> or "DONT LOAD"
[22:29:13] <mershed> setting display:none, opacity:0
[22:29:22] <systemfault> What's the problem with loading?
[22:29:25] <shoky> tell me something
[22:29:35] <mershed> im trying to stop imgs loading
[22:29:37] <shoky> let's say that the browser DIDN'T load those images for you
[22:29:37] <mershed> cancel loads
[22:29:41] <shoky> what would be your next step?
[22:29:48] <mershed> the whole system is set up
[22:29:52] <mershed> it all works great
[22:29:58] <mershed> the only thing i want is to stop the imgs laoding
[22:30:07] <mershed> im not concerned about the rest
[22:30:09] <mershed> thats sorted
[22:30:14] <systemfault> But why do you care?
[22:30:23] <mershed> because i want to load imgs sequentially
[22:30:24] <systemfault> If you load the page.. then you want to see those images, right?
[22:30:27] <mershed> and fade them in
[22:30:32] <mershed> one at a time
[22:30:35] <shoky> what would you do? you'd do  $( ajaxReturnedBigHTMLString )   and then what?
[22:30:36] <mershed> instead of concurrent loads
[22:30:54] <shoky> var fragment = $(  ajaxReturnedBigHTMLString );
[22:30:56] <shoky> your turn
[22:31:01] <mershed> dude, thats not the point
[22:31:10] <shoky> it's my point ;)
[22:31:13] <systemfault> mershed: He got the point..
[22:31:26] <mershed> it basically involves stripping the imgs srcs, storing them in a data attribute
[22:31:36] <mershed> adding them to a queue array
[22:31:43] <mershed> adding load() callbacks
[22:31:48] <mershed> then loading the first one
[22:31:55] <systemfault> mershed: When you have the fragment, you can select your images‚Ä¶ and add a display: none on them.. then fade them in one after another, no?
[22:32:01] <mershed> on load() it loads the next one
[22:32:25] <mershed> systemfault the issue is the imgs ALL start loading
[22:32:36] <mershed> i want to stop them and only load the first, then the next
[22:32:58] <Whirl3d> I need some help with 3D transforms applied via css using jquery...anybody game?
[22:33:11] <mershed> if i do this ("<img src='1.jpg' /> <img src='2.jpg' />")
[22:33:17] <mershed> dont append it to the dom
[22:33:17] <systemfault> The whole HTML loading is hackish.. if you want "more power" then  return a JSON representation and dynamically create the content  on the browser
[22:33:36] <shoky> ^^
[22:33:54] <mershed> far out
[22:34:00] <mershed> its not an option
[22:34:07] <mershed> its a small portfolio site
[22:34:13] <mershed> that wants some flash like preloading
[22:34:33] <mershed> system
[22:34:44] <mershed> do you know a way to cancel an img load
[22:34:46] <mershed> or
[22:34:56] <mershed> to stop the browser from loading every img it gets
[22:35:01] <systemfault> It's impossibru! AFAIK
[22:35:16] <systemfault> As soon as the fragment gets created, it downloads the images
[22:35:16] <mershed> $('<img src="1.jpg" />')
[22:35:26] <mershed> not even appended
[22:35:32] <Whirl3d> on docready, change the src attributes to null for all images and store the src attribute in it's data-url
[22:35:35] <mershed> just made a new img with jquery
[22:35:39] <mershed> that will start to load
[22:35:46] <mershed> theres NO way to stop that?
[22:35:59] <shoky> Whirl3d  he's talking bout ajax
[22:36:12] <mershed> whirl
[22:36:15] <mershed> that doesnt work anyway
[22:36:17] <shoky> and also, setting src to null will stop it?
[22:36:19] <shoky> i doubt
[22:36:22] <mershed> nope
[22:36:23] <mershed> it wont
[22:36:30] <mershed> the load starts before docready
[22:36:41] <mershed> and setting src after load has started seems to do nothing
[22:37:10] <Whirl3d> mershed, this is what I always do. It emulates flash's preloaders pretty well:
[22:37:30] <systemfault> mershed: It doesn't matter to the browser, if a DOM fragment is created, everything is downloaded, the only way around it would be to set the img src to small blank.gif file then some custom attribute on the tag with the url in it
[22:37:31] <Whirl3d> I create an array of urls and a "loadNext" function
[22:37:34] <shoky> Whirl3d but you are organized and have set yourself up an array of urls i assume
[22:37:36] <shoky> yeh ;p
[22:37:48] <shoky> he doesn't have that array
[22:37:53] <mershed> ok how do you create your array
[22:37:54] <Whirl3d> why not?
[22:38:01] <mershed> im loading in html fragments
[22:38:02] <Whirl3d> I poll a sql database
[22:38:03] <shoky> he has a big HTML string with <img src="bla.jpg"> inside
[22:38:16] <Whirl3d> regex
[22:38:21] <shoky> ;]
[22:38:27] <mershed> ye it seems thats the only option
[22:38:30] <systemfault> lol, regex and html...
[22:38:30] <Whirl3d> you've all been through this already
[22:38:32] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:38:44] <mershed> its not a heavy db site
[22:38:53] <mershed> its a simple portfolio with some basic ajax
[22:38:59] <Whirl3d> but it is a heay html fragment site?
[22:39:04] <mershed> ye
[22:39:33] <mershed> well each url serves up either a full site with header/footer/content, or if its requested via ajax, just content
[22:39:37] <Whirl3d> so if you load the content via ajax, before appending it to the dom, regex out the image sources
[22:39:40] <mershed> so the header/footer stay static
[22:39:59] <mershed> ye i was hoping to avoid having to fuck with the strings
[22:40:09] <Whirl3d> oh come on....
[22:40:25] <mershed> it seems logical thered be a way to stop the loading of imgs
[22:40:34] <Whirl3d> you were hoping we'd give you the secret: load images command that does some sort of magic?
[22:40:38] <mershed> no
[22:40:45] <mershed> i was hoping someone knew how to stop an img loading
[22:40:48] <mershed> simple
[22:40:55] <Whirl3d> good cause only shoky, systemfault, coldhead and I get that...
[22:41:13] <mershed> ?
[22:41:15] <Whirl3d> you stop it by removing it's src attribute before appending it to the dom.
[22:41:51] <Whirl3d> I just swap out my src attributes with data-url attributes using regex
[22:41:54] <mershed> you mean before even passing the string to jquery
[22:42:00] <mershed> appending isnt the problem
[22:42:05] <Whirl3d> on ajax success
[22:42:10] <systemfault> mershed: You don't use .load
[22:42:29] <mershed> ?
[22:42:33] <Whirl3d> it doesn't start loading the images until they are appended to the dom. Before that's its just text
[22:42:35] <systemfault> mershed: Only "classic" ajax.. then once you have the html, you can do anything you want with it
[22:42:43] <mershed> oh dear
[22:42:46] <mershed> Whirl
[22:42:50] <mershed> if i have this string
[22:43:02] <mershed> "<img src=bla />"
[22:43:04] <mershed> it wont load
[22:43:10] <mershed> but if i then pass it to jquery
[22:43:24] <mershed> var newImg = $("<img src=bla />")
[22:43:27] <mershed> notice
[22:43:29] <Whirl3d> it will start loading it because you asked it to
[22:43:30] <systemfault> Indeed.. it creates a fragment.. we get that.
[22:43:30] <mershed> i havent appended it
[22:43:54] <Whirl3d> But you don't pass the entire html to jquery
[22:43:59] <Whirl3d> until you append it.
[22:44:03] <mershed> ok so are you saying $(string) appends it to the dom
[22:44:17] <Whirl3d> so while it's html (not $(data) just data), parse out the images
[22:44:25] <mershed> ye i get that
[22:44:28] <mershed> we are going round in circles
[22:44:39] <Whirl3d> $ (html) creates an unattached element
[22:44:47] <mershed> i was just hoping i could convert it $(html)
[22:44:55] <mershed> so i can do
[22:45:01] <mershed> $(html).find("img"
[22:45:12] <Whirl3d> only if it is already loaded
[22:45:15] <Whirl3d> that's the issue
[22:45:16] <shoky> var fragment = $( htmlStr.replace(/<img/g, '<zimg') );  fragment.find('zimg').bla();   ;\
[22:45:55] <mershed> interesting, i didnt think of breaking the img tag
[22:46:14] <mershed> i was going to try and regex the src attribute and convert it to a data-url
[22:46:31] <shoky> that'd get real hairy
[22:46:41] <mershed> exactly why i was hoping to avoid it
[22:46:53] <mershed> thanks man, thats a great idea
[22:47:01] <shoky> heh np
[22:47:10] <mershed> so you can use jquery to access invalid nodes
[22:47:22] <mershed> zimg
[22:47:45] <mershed> i assumed you could only call valid elements or class/ids etc
[22:47:50] <Whirl3d> in your success handler for ajax you get function(data) { //data is the raw html -not appended to the dom; data=data.replace(/src/ig, "data-url"); $(target).html(data); });
[22:47:51] <shoky> maybe there are browsers that dont allow it, donno. you could use <blink> or smth :D
[22:47:58] <shoky> <marquee>
[22:48:59] <Whirl3d> changing the src attr to data-url allows you to have access to your image elements (without sources) to preload images sequetially from there
[22:49:18] <mershed> whirl that would work too, that regex seems a little un-conditional tho
[22:49:37] <mershed> but ye, i was plannin on doing that
[22:49:41] <Whirl3d> sure, any other elements that had a src= attr would fail. LOL
[22:49:53] <Whirl3d> but there aren't that many that I know of
[22:49:57] <mershed> true
[22:49:58] <shoky> <img src="/src/src.jpg">
[22:50:04] <te-brian> Trying to apply $.Deferreds to a problemÖ let me gist it real quick
[22:50:04] <mershed> haha
[22:50:34] <mershed> god it would all be so much easier if i could just control browser loading behaviour
[22:50:38] <mershed> oh well
[22:50:57] <shoky> or if you had a better backend API
[22:51:13] <mershed> expecting some loading control isnt too demanding
[22:51:15] <Whirl3d> true:   /\<img src=/ig, "<img data-url=
[22:51:26] <mershed> html + fanciness = the thing that should not be
[22:51:40] <mershed> its never simple
[22:52:20] <Whirl3d> that's nothing. try slicing your images for 3d transforms that rollup...blech
[22:52:31] <mershed> :/
[22:52:34] <mershed> i dont even wanna know
[22:52:39] <mershed> :P
[22:53:05] <Whirl3d> Its a great effect, but it's proving to be more difficult than I had hoped.
[22:53:06] <Whirl3d> file:///C:/Users/Jason/Documents/Web/whirl3d.com/projects/3D_popup/index2.html
[22:53:22] <mershed> uh
[22:53:26] <mershed> thats a local url
[22:53:32] <Whirl3d> lolk
[22:53:33] <mershed> ??
[22:53:34] <Whirl3d> sorry
[22:54:03] <Whirl3d> http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/3DHoverEffects/index2.html
[22:54:38] <mershed> what suck is the fact that there are lots of people out there with dev blogs with articles about how you can stop imgs loading by removing src and all this other nonsense that doesnt seem to work
[22:54:52] <mershed> gave me false hope
[22:55:08] <coldhead> the best way to prevent them downloading is to unplug the modem
[22:55:15] <coldhead> unless they're cached :(
[22:55:28] <mershed> i started off in flash, so dont hate me if i expect to be able to preload things with the ability to cancel
[22:55:28] <Whirl3d> unlpug the pc in that case
[22:55:36] <coldhead> case closed!
[22:56:10] <mershed> cool effect whirl
[22:56:15] <Whirl3d> flash would require the urls in advance anyays
[22:57:19] <Whirl3d> I hope adobe release AS5 soon...just cause it looks like ass...
[22:57:22] <mershed> how many slices did you have to make
[22:57:30] <Whirl3d> I'm trying to make it dynamic
[22:57:38] <mershed> roughyl
[22:57:41] <Whirl3d> so you could control the granularity
[22:57:41] <mershed> *roughly
[22:57:47] <Whirl3d> this demo did like 5
[22:57:53] <mershed> not too bad
[22:57:57] <Whirl3d> I didn't do this demo, I'm using it as a reference
[22:58:36] <mershed> oh
[22:59:06] <Whirl3d> and they manually coded the controls....it should happen dynamically.
[22:59:08] <shoky> Whirl3d donno if i'll be able to help, but what's your issue?
[23:00:21] <Whirl3d> right now, the images peel up horizontally....I need them to do it vertically, so they "appear" to rotate from a flat plain(where you don't see them) to 90 degrees (where they are standing up)
[23:00:55] <Whirl3d> like this a little bit...but with offset center of rotation and the slice effect: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/yuYyW/27/

[23:03:20] <sente> heh true
[23:04:06] <Whirl3d> http://www.whirl3d.com/projects/3dSlice/diagram.jpg   maybe...
[23:04:25] <Whirl3d> it was 80087355, I'm pretty sure...
[23:04:32] <te-brian> Ok.. trying to apply Deferreds to my problem.. see this http://jsfiddle.net/Z6jjs/ Ö in that example you can click the button right away.. and 3 secs later 'clicked' will appear.  BUT, it will only ever run once.  I would like to defer the callback, and allow it to run unlimited timesÖ.
[23:05:13] <Whirl3d> then requires two arguments
[23:05:25] <Whirl3d> done requires one
[23:05:36] <te-brian> two args?
[23:05:42] <shoky> then called with one argument is same as done
[23:05:56] <Whirl3d> ? then
[23:05:56] <bot-t> deferred.then(doneCallbacks, failCallbacks): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved or rejected. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[23:06:23] <te-brian> in this case there is not such thing as 'rejects' .. just 'first time' and 'every other time'
[23:06:24] <Whirl3d> according to the docs, the second param is not optional. weird.
[23:06:39] <te-brian> yeah .. weird indeed about the docs
[23:07:01] <Whirl3d> why are you wanting to do this with deferred?
[23:07:37] <te-brian> this is a contrived example to get help.. the real problem is with socket.io event handlersÖ I need to bind handlers after the original ones fired.
[23:08:14] <te-brian> in the real case it is working the same way.. I can capture the first occurance of the event (for example 'reconnect') .. but I want to catch all the rest too
[23:08:22] <shoky> a deferred only ever resolves once
[23:08:46] <te-brian> that is what I am realizing.. seems like there is some combination of logic that could do what I need though
[23:08:49] <Whirl3d> and you don't have a button click handler defined (except in the context of the deferred) so it resolves and then no handler
[23:08:57] <te-brian> a deferred that then re-binds itself or something
[23:09:15] <Whirl3d> maybe you could use $.Callbacks and .fire
[23:09:37] <Whirl3d> or just bind and trigger
[23:15:25] <te-brian> Updated it to a version that is pretty close .. only problem now is any extra clicks in the first 3 seconds are lost.
[23:16:17] <te-brian> http://jsfiddle.net/Z6jjs/1/
[23:16:33] <Whirl3d> why not just write a click  handler that records all the clicks and a delay mechanism for delivering them seperately.
[23:17:13] <te-brian> not sure exactly where u are going with that
[23:23:54] <Whirl3d> so you want the first click to pause for 3 seconds, then subsequent clicks to go through realtime?
[23:26:05] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Z6jjs/4/   here's all I was saying. It uses the deferred to wait for 3 seconds then because it's resolved, it passes the clicks through immediately afterwards...
[23:26:14] <shoky> he wants all clicks to show 'Clicked' , but only starting after 3 seconds from domready
[23:26:17] <tylerwhitney> I want to open a PDF in a new window on a click, but I have other things to do in the function first... when it calls the window.open it construes it as a popup and gets blocked, even though its tied to a user click
[23:26:20] <tylerwhitney> any suggestions?
[23:26:51] <shoky> or maybe i was wrong
[23:27:06] <RonWhoCares> I have created a JSFiddle @ http://jsfiddle.net/6D6ds/   My question: Is there a way to populate the INPUT fields using JQuery --- the JQuery script I posted doesn't, but that is the goal      <input type="text" name="starting_date" id="starting_date" placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD" class="Bible_word_search_generator_user_input_field" />       <input type="text" name="ending_date" id="ending_date"...
[23:27:07] <RonWhoCares> ...placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD" class="Bible_word_search_generator_user_input_field" />
[23:30:05] <shoky> RonWhoCares: you mean .val() ?
[23:30:36] <shoky> <input>s don't have children nodes
[23:30:51] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I should be using .val   instead of .html ?
[23:31:02] <shoky> seems like it
[23:32:08] <RonWhoCares> Shoky  What do you, I learned something tonight
[23:32:14] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Thanks!
[23:32:32] <shoky> RonWhoCares: also use .change not .click on the <select>
[23:32:57] <RonWhoCares> ok
[23:33:17] <shoky> cause now it sends ajax requests when you just click it, before selecing anything
[23:34:14] <oskude> hi, got a sortable nested accordion and trying to add "normal" elements inside the "One" accordion. but what ever i try, it either breaks the nesting or it comes up as part of the nested accordion http://jsfiddle.net/ErfcD/ any tips?
[23:35:19] <coldhead> try to do something simpler?
[23:35:30] <coldhead> lol that's what i'd do, you're doing hardcore stuff!
[23:35:45] <coldhead> hope i can get to that level someday
[23:35:48] <oskude> the closest i can get is this http://jsfiddle.net/ErfcD/1/ but the "foobar" should not be part of sortable
[23:35:55] <te-brian> Whirl3d, shoky .. its a little different (hard to explain obviously :) Ö pretend you can't bind your click handler for 3 sends .. but you want to catch every click .. even those before your handler was bound
[23:36:03] <te-brian> secs*
[23:36:48] <te-brian> I can explain the real-life situation if you think it would help :)
[23:36:53] <RonWhoCares> Thanks again shoky
[23:37:00] <RonWhoCares> I really appreciate your help tonight
[23:39:27] <mfoxdogg|work> oskude: <div class="accordian"> is being made sortable
[23:40:51] <oskude> mfoxdogg|work: yup, tried to make only div.group sortable, but then no sorting works
[23:41:32] <mfoxdogg|work> just hold on a tick
[23:41:36] <oskude> but reading sortable docs now (using it the first time)
[23:43:31] <mfoxdogg|work> nevermind, i screwed up :S
[23:43:49] <oskude> mfoxdogg|work: got it, items: "div.group" for the sortable seems to do the trick
[23:44:02] <mfoxdogg|work> ok
[23:44:21] <oskude> http://jsfiddle.net/ErfcD/2/ now "foobar" is not sortable

[23:51:04] <shoky> oh Kazii you're back
[23:51:13] <coldhead> good times
[23:51:14] <shoky> tried to reply to your pm before
[23:51:36] <coldhead> I WAS WEARING EYELINER SHE WAS WEARING EYELINER
[23:51:40] <shoky> i think i was saying that i didnt understand what your code was doing ;p
[23:52:03] <coldhead> my manta ray is alright
[23:52:10] <Kazii> Yeah sorry had to relocate in a hurry lol
[23:52:29] <Kazii> Did you get my pm shoky ?
[23:52:49] <shoky> Kazii yeah, and i didnt understand your code
[23:53:31] <shoky> and you're using several plugins i dont really know
[23:53:40] <Kazii> shoky lol, Its probably best I hit up http://jqfundamentals.com/ like coldhead sudgested earlier first :)
[23:53:48] <te-brian> shoky, Indeed that is a very literally implementation of the situation I describe.. can't complain about it.. tho its not quite the pattern I was looking for..
[23:53:53] <shoky> also you're using eval, yuck
[23:54:38] <te-brian> shoky, That last fiddle I pasted seems to be working for my use caseÖ since socket.io connection events are very synchronous (connect does not fire before connecting)
[23:55:59] <te-brian> fwiw .. this is what I'm using Ö https://gist.github.com/d432b7c097f921421c93
[23:56:18] <te-brian> shoky, just talking it out always helps clear things up.. thanks
