[03:23:58] <tuskkk___> was trying to get a value of an input field in the reveal modal using its ID, but was unsuccessful and has to use the class instead, why do these popup modals create a copy of the code?
[03:24:47] <Demonen> Are they iframes?
[03:28:37] <tuskkk___> Demonen: No
[03:31:47] <Demonen> What kind of popup modals? Are you making them yourself, or is there some kind of framework? Copy of what code?
[03:32:18] <tuskkk___> Demonen: bootstrap modals, foundation reveal modals
[03:37:35] <Demonen> ...and the last question?
[03:43:43] <tuskkk___> copy of the modal itself, @Demonen
[03:44:04] <Demonen> Okay, so the actual HTML markup?
[03:44:17] <Demonen> Can you isolate it in a fiddle?
[03:50:24] <Guest85878> I'm trying to use '.on('click', function() { ... }); to click a button that was generated with ajax. It isn't working, though. Is there any way around this? I believe it's because clicking is synchronous, while ajax generated content is asynchronous.
[03:52:44] <Demonen> Guest29008: Sounds like you need delegation
[03:52:57] <Demonen> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[03:53:10] <Demonen> Dammit, that was for you celty.
[03:54:22] <celty> I've actually looked at that quite a few times to try to get my code to work, but I guess I don't fully understand it since it hasn't changed anything. Thank you, though! I'll definitely give it another look at right now. :D
[03:55:38] <Demonen> The point of it is to attach the event to an element surrounding where the ajax-y buttons are inserted.
[03:55:51] <Uhkis> celty: the principle is: you bind the event to a parent that's on that page on load.
[03:56:26] <Demonen> Let's say they're all in a specific div, with the ID of foo. You'd say $("#foo button").on("click",functionRefHere);
[03:57:06] <Demonen> That would attach functionRefHere to all buttons, current and future, inside <div id="foo">
[03:57:11] <Uhkis> no.
[03:57:20] <Demonen> No?
[03:57:50] <Demonen> Oh, wait, hahaha
[03:57:50] <Uhkis> it's: $('#foo').on('click', 'button', func);
[03:57:55] <Demonen> I had it the wrong way around.
[03:57:58] <Demonen> Thanks Uhkis
[03:58:00] <Uhkis> :)
[03:59:48] <celty> So, could I use $("#foo button").on("click", "input:last", function); ?
[04:02:42] <Demonen> No, just $("#foo").on(...
[04:02:50] <Demonen> Sorry about mixing it up in my head like that >.<
[04:03:38] <celty> Then, remove the 'button' part. I can use "input:last", right?
[04:04:39] <Jonno_FTW> anyone familiar with bootstrap-select?
[04:11:42] <Demonen> celty: Not very familiar with the :last selector. Why not input[type="submit"] or similar?
[04:12:10] <Demonen> AFAIK, the :last selector carries a performance penalty.
[04:12:10] <celty> I'm afraid that I've given that a try and no dice.
[04:12:20] <celty> Oh, huh, that's interesting to know.
[04:13:23] <Demonen> I'm sure it isn't huge, but there is no equivalent DOM method, so what it does is essentially grabbing all the elements and then discarding all but the last one.
[04:13:26] <Demonen> https://api.jquery.com/last-selector/
[04:14:26] <celty> Hmm.. interesting. Thanks a lot for the information, I appreciate it.
[04:14:34] <celty> If I can't get my code to work, do you mind helping me out?
[04:16:22] <Demonen> Just ask in here, I guess.
[04:17:43] <celty> Very well then. Again, thank you.
[04:17:52] <Demonen> Getting a support agreement from me, where I obligate myself to helping you, isn't cheap :-P
[04:18:00] <Demonen> You're welcome, and good luck.
[04:31:26] <hellyeah> in jquery datepicker, current daey is selected default how can i remove this date?
[06:45:21] <hellyeah> hey
[07:18:53] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:23:13] <Demonen> hellyeah: It's usually better to just ask your question.
[07:23:35] <Demonen> That usually catches people's intrest a lot better than asking if anyone is around.
[07:23:48] <Demonen> :)
[07:26:34] <hellyeah> :p
[07:27:02] <hellyeah> bind is depreceated?
[07:27:22] <awkwardCough> use on() instead
[07:27:49] <hellyeah> hmm yes i know the suggestion but why not bind
[07:27:55] <hellyeah> what is the exact reason?
[07:28:02] <awkwardCough> cause they do the same thing
[07:28:08] <awkwardCough> and bind() doesn't do delegates
[07:28:08] <Demonen> Because .on is much more flexible.
[07:28:19] <awkwardCough> and iirc bind is a wrapper for on currently
[07:28:48] <hellyeah> ic
[07:28:50] <awkwardCough> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.fn.bind
[07:38:10] <hellyeah> hey
[07:38:14] <hellyeah> if i show my code
[07:38:20] <hellyeah> can you criticize it?
[07:38:36] <awkwardCough> 'you'
[07:38:45] <hellyeah> you?
[07:38:53] <hellyeah> i mean you
[07:39:06] <awkwardCough> who? lol.  'you' is ambiguous
[07:39:09] <hellyeah> people who doesnt have any problem at coding jquery
[07:39:18] <awkwardCough> 'anyone'
[07:39:28] <hellyeah> can one of you criticize it?
[07:39:35] <awkwardCough> there ya go
[07:39:37] <hellyeah> can anyone criticize it? xD
[07:41:09] <hellyeah> click first input and title click any month or dialog titlt to get yearlist you can go any year and any month. And do you have any suggestion about my code? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/10/
[07:41:45] <taplar> still has the case statement in the second part
[07:41:56] <taplar> *switch statement
[07:42:21] <taplar> why are you doing input[value=from] in your css selector?  the element has a class...
[07:47:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  you mean after 115
[07:47:27] <taplar> you see any other switch?
[07:47:37] <hellyeah> right :D
[07:50:49] <hellyeah> i fixed that switch thing
[07:51:00] <hellyeah> that is not necessary really
[07:51:14] <hellyeah> i forgot that detail it was on my mind
[07:52:19] <hellyeah> taplar:  that css thing, any harm there?
[07:52:27] <taplar> why do it that way
[07:53:09] <hellyeah> well i am just practicing different ways
[07:53:16] <hellyeah> i am still learning
[07:53:40] <hellyeah> i can change this
[07:54:29] <hellyeah> dont understand something here
[07:54:56] <hellyeah> if i use thos variable var $datepickerDiv = $('#ui-datepicker-div'); var $dialogTitle = $("span.ui-dialog-title");
[07:55:00] <hellyeah> that doesnt work
[07:55:12] <hellyeah> that expect selectore directly instead of variable
[07:55:16] <hellyeah> i dont understand that part
[07:55:36] <taplar> your trying ot lookup the datepicker div before it exists
[07:56:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:56:03] <hellyeah> ic
[07:56:35] <hellyeah> datepicker exist after page load
[07:56:40] <hellyeah> is it true to say?
[07:56:42] <taplar> no
[07:56:56] <taplar> it exists after a datepicker is initialized
[07:57:10] <taplar> when ever, if ever, that happens
[07:57:48] <hellyeah> but it happens after click event
[07:57:49] <hellyeah> ?
[07:58:00] <taplar> no
[07:58:07] <taplar> it's exactly like i said it
[07:58:18] <taplar> after the first time you initialize a datepicker, that will exist
[07:59:42] <taplar> the datepicker becoming visible is not the initialization
[07:59:47] <taplar> you get that right?
[08:00:07] <taplar> datepicker() <-- that is initialization
[08:01:13] <taplar> which should ideally only happen once per input
[08:02:13] <hellyeah> yeah i understand sorry
[08:03:15] <hellyeah> one more thing tho
[08:03:27] <hellyeah> i couldnt find how can i remove current day from datepicker
[08:03:41] <hellyeah> datepicker comes with a day is selected default
[08:03:46] <taplar> i thought you were asking for criticism on your fiddle
[08:04:12] <hellyeah> is there more?
[08:04:14] <hellyeah> xD
[08:04:22] <taplar> did you think there wasn't?
[08:04:35] <taplar> i haven't seen the changes you've made either
[08:04:51] <hellyeah> ops

[08:29:20] <andrewSC> hi all
[08:29:32] <taplar> aloha
[08:29:32] <awkwardCough> hola
[08:30:03] <andrewSC> Am I nuts or when I use .append(content) on a div, and that div becomes greater than the height of the browser window, the browser should allow me to scroll the page no?
[08:30:12] <andrewSC> or is this more of a css issue?
[08:30:38] <taplar> sounds like you have overflow:hidden or something somewhere in your css
[08:30:59] <andrewSC> gotcha, I didn't think it was the JS... I'll do some looking around taplar, thanks
[08:40:20] <andrewSC> taplar: body { overflow: hidden; ...} in a css class for a lib I don't use anymore...
[08:40:23] <andrewSC> tsk tsk..
[08:40:33] <taplar> :)
[08:40:57] <taplar> at least you found it, and now your down an unused lib!
[08:41:05] <andrewSC> correct
[09:12:32] <hellyeah> awkwardCough:  thanks so much
[09:12:37] <hellyeah> taplar:  thans so much
[09:13:52] <hellyeah> awkwardCough:  you there?
[09:14:07] <awkwardCough> in a sense
[09:14:27] <hellyeah> i see the question
[09:14:42] <awkwardCough> i do not
[09:14:47] <hellyeah> can you not put the data-month on the elements so you don't have to do this in the js?
[09:15:13] <taplar> yup
[09:15:29] <awkwardCough> yes, that is a question. What is your best guess?
[09:15:53] <hellyeah> i am putting data-month because when you click any data on the monthsList that shows up after click datepicker-title i am getting value 0 to 11 and i put  the month selection on that datepicker according to number for example jas is 0 feb is 1 etc.
[09:16:11] <hellyeah> thats why i am using data attribute
[09:16:12] <taplar> i'm not asking why
[09:16:23] <taplar> it's asking why your doing that in the js.  rather than just putting it in the markup
[09:16:30] <hellyeah> yeah i know this is the way i can think of
[09:16:36] <hellyeah> ah
[09:16:39] <hellyeah> ops sorry
[09:16:43] <taplar> :s
[09:16:49] <hellyeah> i mean
[09:17:16] <hellyeah> yeah i understood the question
[09:17:24] <hellyeah> i dont know markup part
[09:17:29] <taplar> html
[09:17:33] <hellyeah> i mean there is a difference
[09:17:39] <taplar> html == markup
[09:17:41] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am just confused
[09:17:44] <hellyeah> yeah i know
[09:17:52] <taplar> so what are you confused about?
[09:17:58] <hellyeah> it seems i used data attribute in js
[09:18:03] <hellyeah> it is just like my doing
[09:18:09] <taplar> dude
[09:18:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:18:23] <hellyeah> i am reading
[09:18:26] <taplar> you use data() when it is a custom thing or you don't have the ability to change the markup
[09:18:28] <taplar> BUT YOU DO
[09:18:39] <taplar> so just put the data in the markup
[09:19:23] <taplar> your fixing adding a missing element to the markup with js, instead of just not making it missing in the first place
[09:20:15] <hellyeah> i need to check smt
[09:22:04] <hellyeah> $('.month1').data('month', 0);
[09:22:28] <hellyeah> <div class="box1 month1" data-month="0">
[09:22:30] <hellyeah> right
[09:22:35] <taplar> yes
[09:22:57] <hellyeah> okey
[09:23:11] <hellyeah> still dont know the exact reason :p
[09:23:22] <taplar> ok
[09:23:28] <taplar> your putting a door in your house
[09:23:39] <taplar> but for some reason there's a hole in the middle of it
[09:23:51] <taplar> you made the door, you could have not put a hole there, but for some reason you did
[09:23:58] <taplar> now your like, hey i don't want a hole
[09:24:01] <taplar> so you fix it
[09:24:15] <taplar> but now every time you come back to the door, you remove the fix and say, hey i don't want a hole
[09:24:18] <taplar> and fix it again
[09:24:26] <taplar> instead of not putting a hole in the dang door in the first place
[09:25:08] <taplar> make sense
[09:25:09] <taplar> ?
[09:25:46] <hellyeah> let me read
[09:26:45] <hellyeah> really clear
[09:26:51] <taplar> yay
[09:26:56] <awkwardCough> :D
[09:27:04] <hellyeah> when dom is loaded
[09:27:13] <hellyeah> this data attr is loaded just once
[09:27:23] <hellyeah> instead of loading every time
[09:27:31] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are really nice person
[09:27:32] <taplar> uh, it load every time
[09:27:37] <taplar> *loads
[09:27:44] <taplar> your just not fixing it every time
[09:27:52] <hellyeah> i understand this
[09:27:57] <hellyeah> okey my english is limited
[09:28:03] <hellyeah> i really understand btw
[09:28:17] <hellyeah> you should allow me to grab a beer for you one day : )
[09:28:38] <taplar> not a drinker, but the offer is appreciated
[09:28:48] <hellyeah> it can be cofee
[09:28:51] <hellyeah> :p
[09:29:01] <hellyeah> starbucks
[09:29:03] <hellyeah> :xp
[09:29:04] <taplar> lol
[09:29:16] <hellyeah> man i really appreciated
[09:29:22] <hellyeah> we are talking like six months
[09:29:31] <hellyeah> you never refuse me always welcome me
[09:29:43] <hellyeah> in the place i work some ppl are really jackass
[09:29:52] <taplar> such is life, ;)
[09:29:53] <hellyeah> xthey dont offer any help
[09:30:06] <hellyeah> or they dont care what i am doin how i am doin
[09:30:22] <taplar> well, everyone has their own situation
[09:30:30] <taplar> maybe they don't feel secure enough to help others
[09:31:00] <hellyeah> it can be the case
[09:31:22] <hellyeah> actually i offer him to give some knowledge about what i am doing also basic js concepts
[09:31:22] <taplar> i mean i remember when you first came in here you were talking about always being scared of losing your job
[09:31:29] <hellyeah> they have just attitude to refuse
[09:31:44] <hellyeah> yes
[09:32:02] <hellyeah> because i was scared for not writing those codes
[09:32:09] <hellyeah> i guess i really cultivated
[09:32:18] <taplar> so if you were scared, they could be scared
[09:32:59] <hellyeah> thing is kinda complicated here
[09:33:10] <hellyeah> tmost of time they are jerks
[09:33:42] <hellyeah> anyway back to code
[09:33:59] <hellyeah> your doing this initialization every time you run though this event handler.  only do it once.
[09:34:11] <hellyeah> can i assign those dialog to variable
[09:34:16] <hellyeah> and use it when it is necessary
[09:34:31] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/13/
[09:36:57] <taplar> you already have the $monthsList variable
[09:37:03] <taplar> i'm not sure what your talking about
[09:38:13] <hellyeah> line 33-44
[09:38:32] <hellyeah> re initializing dialog
[09:38:38] <taplar> right, so your initializing twice in that handler, ln 30 and those lines
[09:38:42] <taplar> of which nothing is dynamic
[09:38:50] <taplar> so just do it once
[09:38:55] <taplar> outside of any handler
[09:39:06] <taplar> and just use the dialog('open') dialog('close') when you need it
[09:39:34] <hellyeah> oh
[09:39:43] <hellyeah> yeah i am asorry i missed that xD
[09:39:48] <hellyeah> my stupidity
[09:40:12] <taplar> i missed ln 30.  my main point was get it out of the event handler
[09:40:33] <hellyeah> just a sec
[09:40:38] <hellyeah> ic what you meant
[09:40:38] <taplar> all the jquery ui elements have helper methods for changing stuff after it is initialized, instead of re-initializing
[09:40:47] <taplar> but this one doesn't even change anything
[09:41:50] <hellyeah> i will do some tricks
[09:44:43] <hellyeah> taplar:  i guess you mean this right https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/xjff0drs/15/
[09:46:55] <taplar> that works
[09:47:09] <hellyeah> is that what you meant?
[09:47:20] <taplar> yep
[09:47:29] <hellyeah> hey i m used $(function() as we discussed earlier to avoid global scope
[09:48:03] <taplar> good deal
[09:48:52] <hellyeah> okey
[09:48:57] <hellyeah> good to understand smt
[09:50:21] <hellyeah> can i use delegates instead of on
[09:50:39] <taplar> on can do delegates
[09:50:52] <taplar> why the hate for on?
[09:52:30] <hellyeah> i am just asking
[09:52:44] <hellyeah> if one day my co workers ask me about something
[09:52:51] <hellyeah> i have to answer them very clearly
[09:53:10] <taplar> both bind and delegate now are wrappers for on
[09:53:12] <taplar> so just use on
[09:53:13] <hellyeah> why data instead of prop
[09:53:20] <hellyeah> if something can be defined in markup
[09:53:29] <hellyeah> is it properties of that element?
[09:53:33] <taplar> attributes
[09:53:38] <taplar> err
[09:53:50] <taplar> <tag data-name="weee">
[09:53:54] <taplar> data-name is an attribute
[09:54:06] <taplar> data('name') is short hand for prop('data-name')
[09:54:55] <hellyeah> ah ic
[09:55:10] <taplar> at which point 'data-name' is also a property of the Element
[09:55:13] <hellyeah> understand now
[10:02:58] <hellyeah> taplar_afk:  jquery-1.9.1.js:507 Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[10:18:17] <taplar_afk> seems self explanitory
[10:23:41] <hellyeah> yeah
[10:23:51] <hellyeah> but why this error happened
[10:23:55] <hellyeah> it is a bug
[10:23:58] <hellyeah> is it browser issue?
[10:24:35] <taplar> your trying to call open on an uninitialized dialog...
[10:24:47] <taplar> as per the error message...
[10:25:29] <hellyeah> what
[10:25:34] <hellyeah> really
[10:25:37] <hellyeah> :p
[10:25:54] <taplar> so why are you asking if it's a browser issue...
[10:25:58] <hellyeah> that cannot be true
[10:26:15] <hellyeah> because i saw this error in i.e.6
[10:26:25] <hellyeah> it was about browser :p
[10:28:19] <arymaynart> Hi people. I am trying to make a conditional field with contact form 7 and jquery, but is not working. The js files are loading propperly, but the script is not working.
[10:28:19] <arymaynart> Here is the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/0f9bwhqY
[10:28:19] <arymaynart> I need to show the content of paisagismo_div only if the user select the radio paisagismo, but is not working at all. I know that new browsers are blocking java
[10:32:45] <taplar> i don't see a id="paisagismo" in there any where
[10:33:13] <taplar> or id="grama"
[10:33:51] <arymaynart> are you shure? [radio tipo_servico id:grama class:grama use_label_element "Grama"][radio tipo_servico id:paisagismo class:paisagismo use_label_element "Paisagismo"]
[10:34:04] <taplar> i don't know what that is, but that's not html
[10:34:26] <arymaynart> this is a contact 7 form tags
[10:34:49] <arymaynart> the implementations is correct, just the javascript is not working at all
[10:34:49] <taplar> so maybe put the generated markup in the pastie so we can see that actual markup the js is running against?
[10:44:44] <taplar> otherwise something like https://jsfiddle.net/twmbhrjv/
[10:53:54] <daveomcd> im using an ajax call to perform some actions, but I want the user's page to wait until they're done.  So I added a "location.reload()" in my success section of the ajax call.  Is this method going to still cause the location.reload to fire before all the steps are finished from that ajax call?
[10:54:35] <taplar> success fires when the ajax calls ends with a success response code
[11:18:33] <VeryBewitching> Does anyone know of a form scraper than can transform form field names like name="answer[15]" into a JavaScript array?
[12:00:46] <NoiseEee> anybody have a fave jquery image editor, cropping filters etc, that can send that image to the backend?
[12:01:20] <taplar> uh, we use one in our shop for cropping, but i don't know the name.  one sec
[12:01:53] <NoiseEee> https://github.com/sconsult/croppic is lovely but i wanna do more than crop :)
[12:06:43] <lulul> can someone help me with this http://notey.it/n/dGI5 i'm on select from dropdown i want to find the div in a carousel that contains that data attribute that is equal to the select and change the image in a div with the found image
[13:00:26] <robertmaxrees> yaaaaay
[13:01:04] <taplar> how dare you break up the marz renames
[13:01:21] <awkwardCough> lol
[13:08:56] <sharax> hi friend
[13:09:05] <sharax> i need use price scroller
[13:09:15] <sharax> but i use innerHTML
[13:09:19] <sharax> on code
[13:10:45] <robertmaxrees> "price scroller"?
[13:12:42] <sharax> sorry
[13:12:44] <sharax> Price Range Sliders
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> so what's the problem?
[13:13:09] <robertmaxrees> and what does using innerhtml have to to with anything?  maybe setup an example in a fiddle?
[13:31:24] <sharax> robertmaxrees is not possible setup in fiddle
[13:31:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[13:31:48] <sharax> becuse use php
[13:31:52] <robertmaxrees> er.
[13:31:54] <sharax> and make javascript code from php
[13:31:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't need the php.
[13:32:04] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't do that, but that's irrelevant.
[13:32:10] <robertmaxrees> so let's back up.
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> which slider are you using?  the one in jquery ui?>
[13:32:34] <sharax> i using
[13:32:34] <sharax> document.getElementById('buttons').innerHTML = betbuttons;
[13:32:43] <robertmaxrees> which slider are you using?
[13:33:16] <sharax> no, using input button
[13:33:36] <robertmaxrees> for a range?
[13:33:43] <sharax> yea
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ at least give me some markup to work with, then.
[13:34:09] <sharax> w8
[13:34:12] <sharax> wite*
[13:36:01] * taplar wites
[13:37:45] <sharax> http://kopy.io/RoJUO
[13:37:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not html.
[13:38:03] <robertmaxrees> show me html, not php :)
[13:39:09] <taplar> generating javascript with php, which generates html
[13:39:14] <taplar> fun times
[13:39:18] <robertmaxrees> bad idea.
[13:39:22] <taplar> :D
[13:39:34] <taplar> you don't enjoy migranes?
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qcsx3yzz/
[13:39:41] <robertmaxrees> so basically this.
[13:39:43] <robertmaxrees> so it's a dropdown.
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> sharax okay, so now that I've done the impossible and made a fiddle, what next?
[13:40:08] <sharax> yea
[13:40:09] <sharax> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range
[13:40:33] <robertmaxrees> what do these two things have to do with one another?
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to use the range slider to change which option is selected in the dropdown?
[13:41:11] <sharax> yes friend
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[13:41:19] <robertmaxrees> you already have a dropdown.
[13:41:21] <robertmaxrees> just use that.
[13:41:30] <sharax> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#hotelrooms
[13:41:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a weird UX.
[13:41:59] <robertmaxrees> but there's code on that page that tells you how to do it - click "view source"
[13:44:10] <sharax> Yes, I studied source
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> so then use it?
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> :) not sure where your lost.
[13:44:47] <robertmaxrees> *you're
[13:45:15] <sharax> But I can not use on innerhtml
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> so why is it working for me?
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying to do.
[13:45:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qcsx3yzz/ update this to show me the js you're using.
[13:46:22] <sharax>  	document.getElementById('buttons').innerHTML = betbuttons; used on other php file and use php file from loop on my site
[13:46:50] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what that means.
[13:46:57] <taplar> that has nothing to do with a slider
[13:46:59] <robertmaxrees> does the dropdown get made on your page?
[13:47:04] <robertmaxrees> because if so, then the slider will work.
[13:47:15] <robertmaxrees> javascript has nothing to do with php.
[13:47:20] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't interact with it at all.
[13:55:14] <sharax> http://kopy.io/SoCmQ
[13:55:19] <sharax> http://kopy.io/TSH4s
[13:55:20] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:55:22] <sharax> please check
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> what
[13:55:25] <sharax> please...
[13:55:29] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle duder.
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> workable test cases.
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> why are you linking css via js?
[13:56:46] <sharax> i developer :D
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea.
[13:57:58] <taplar> lol, i'm sorry
[13:58:13] <taplar> you have a function that is checking if a file is already loaded
[13:58:17] <taplar> but your checking it with a string
[13:58:19] <taplar> not an array
[13:58:21] <taplar> ....
[14:00:14] <robertmaxrees> sharax your issue has nothing to do with jquery or jquery ui - you have some pretty big architectural issues here.
[14:00:41] <taplar> which is very strange.  cause your doing/trying some complex stuff
[14:00:46] <taplar> but then with some basic stuff......
[14:00:56] <robertmaxrees> this feels very "code by google" to me.
[14:01:01] <taplar> ah
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:01:16] <robertmaxrees> not able to make a simple test case because is uses PHP?
[14:01:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:32:58] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[14:33:04] <robertmaxrees> hello gambl0re
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm breathing.  how are you?
[14:36:59] <gambl0re> good
[14:38:22] <jmzc> hi
[14:38:26] <robertmaxrees> hello
[14:38:35] <jmzc> if I do $(window).on("message onmessage", ....) , i mean, I attach a event handler to my window object
[14:38:40] <jmzc>  if I change the document ( html content ) , is destroyed the handler ?
[14:39:06] <robertmaxrees> no, but you shouldn't be removing the document at such a base level.
[14:39:28] <jmzc> i dont understand
[14:39:41] <robertmaxrees> what are you changing?
[14:39:58] <jmzc> i've got a  HTML page that executes that code onReady()
[14:40:21] <jmzc> if I change the page ( another URL, changing location )
[14:40:34] <robertmaxrees> then yes, the handler is destroyed.
[14:40:42] <jmzc> and back to the first page
[14:40:56] <robertmaxrees> the window object on a page only persists while that page exists.  you'd have to manually reattach it.
[14:41:08] <jmzc> ok, thanks
[15:03:12] <ABM_Dan> Say I have $foo with a bunch of elements in it, and $bar with a different selection, can I execute something on both of them without changing their selection?
[15:03:36] <robertmaxrees> $foo.add($bar) doesn't modify either set.
[15:03:40] <ABM_Dan> like $foo.and($bar).click(function() {...});
[15:03:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:03:46] <ABM_Dan> thank you.
[15:18:26] <sharp555> i know no JS/jQuery, but am looking for some quick help with this code: http://pastebin.com/NX0e0rfe
[15:18:35] <robertmaxrees> whatcha need?
[15:19:27] <sharp555> right now that bottom function doesn't take any arguments, how would i use the same thing but with a form to pass "data" in the ajax POST?
[15:19:49] <sharp555> so basically, use this with a form instead of just a button
[15:19:50] <robertmaxrees> "the bottom function" being...?
[15:20:05] <sharp555> the one triggered by start-bg-job
[15:20:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean start_long_task?
[15:20:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd bind to the form's submit event
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> and use $(this) to access the form itself.
[15:21:08] <sharp555> well, but start_long_task is started by another function which is ran when the button is clicked. right?
[15:21:22] <robertmaxrees> then you could seralize the form.
[15:21:31] <robertmaxrees> and sure, why does that matter?
[15:21:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery sets the context of the function to the element you ran it against.
[15:22:43] <sharp555> okay. what is the code to access the form?
[15:23:17] <sharp555> so that i can put data: form_data in `start_long_task`
[15:23:42] <sharp555> i really know nothing, sorry.
[15:24:07] <robertmaxrees> sec
[15:24:48] <robertmaxrees> $(this) would be the form in start_long_task
[15:25:50] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably want to do function start_long_task(e) { and then e.preventDefault(); as the first line in that function to prevent the page from going to the submit thinger.
[15:26:23] <sharp555> okay
[15:29:17] <sharp555> and then i can just do `data: $(this)`?
[15:29:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:29:34] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to extract the data somebody.
[15:29:41] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is just a jquery object of the form.
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> you probably want JSON/.
[15:30:05] <sharp555> json would be great, any string would be fine
[15:30:26] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/ or https://api.jquery.com/serialize/ are two build in options.  otherwise, you'll have to do it yourself.
[15:30:44] <sharp555> i will read up, thank you robertmaxrees
[15:31:31] <sharp555> do you have a favorite tutorial? i was going to go through the duckett book
[15:31:54] <robertmaxrees> those pages tell you everything you need.
[15:32:19] <sharp555> alright, thank you again
[17:28:40] <berpcor|2> Hello, anyone here? )
[17:28:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:29:15] <berpcor|2> Great.
[17:29:27] <berpcor|2> Moment, I'll create my question in jsbin...
[17:32:47] <berpcor|2> http://jsbin.com/firijubuse/edit?html,js,output
[17:34:04] <robertmaxrees> okay.  sup?
[17:34:57] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: I wrote in comment. Each loop I have the same value.
[17:35:13] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: For some reasons, although my i variable is different each time.
[17:35:23] <robertmaxrees> so this is actually invalid code.
[17:36:05] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: (7)/img/furniture/w/7.jpg - in my console
[17:36:22] <berpcor|2> The last value 7 times.
[17:36:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:36:42] <robertmaxrees> your code isn't doing what you think it is :)
[17:37:01] <robertmaxrees> so here's the rundown.
[17:37:11] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: What exactly I do not understand?
[17:37:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm about to explain it.
[17:37:24] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Could you explain, please.
[17:37:27] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:37:33] <robertmaxrees> lol i just said i'm going to - one sec.
[17:37:37] <berpcor|2> )
[17:37:42] <berpcor|2> I see already.
[17:37:52] <robertmaxrees> what do you think it is?
[17:38:12] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Each time I fill my array by new values.
[17:38:16] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:38:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not the issue.
[17:38:28] <berpcor|2> Each new value is a result of for loop.
[17:38:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not why your stuff is broken.
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> first of all, you never declare i, so it's global.  also, .load() is async.  so what happens is you queue up var img = $('<img src="' + mgallery.wardrobe + '/' + i + '.jpg' + '"/>').load(function() { 7 times.  when that callback fires, i has been set to 7.
[17:39:25] <robertmaxrees> because i is global.
[17:39:33] <robertmaxrees> and that was its last value.
[17:40:23] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Do not tell me the correct variant yet )
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> gladly :)
[17:40:32] <berpcor|2> I'll try to write it by myself.
[17:41:22] <berpcor|2> for (i = 1; i <= 7; i++) - i = 1 It is declaration, isn't it?
[17:41:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:41:36] <robertmaxrees> you never do var i = whatever
[17:41:44] <robertmaxrees> but that alone won't fix your problem.
[17:42:30] <berpcor|2> I need to remove load()...
[17:42:39] <berpcor|2> By something else...
[17:43:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:43:15] <robertmaxrees> that won't fix it either.
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> you can keep using .load()
[17:43:59] <berpcor|2> I need to move load() outside of for loop.
[17:44:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:44:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:44:12] <robertmaxrees> you're really stretching.
[17:44:22] <robertmaxrees> your issue is scope.
[17:45:56] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what "scope" means in js?
[17:46:15] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: I think I do )
[17:46:28] <robertmaxrees> do you see how that would apply here?
[17:47:08] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Besides, this is the thing I do not understand fully yet...
[17:47:18] <berpcor|2> I remembered )
[17:47:24] <robertmaxrees> so do you understand my explanation above?
[17:48:08] <berpcor|2> I think I understand what do you mean, but I do not have solution yet...
[17:48:15] <berpcor|2> *what you
[17:48:24] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:48:28] <robertmaxrees> btw, why 7?
[17:49:21] <berpcor|2> This is number of images in folder.
[17:49:30] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:49:33] <berpcor|2> I know, this is not the best approach.
[17:49:51] <robertmaxrees> if you had an array to work with here instead, this would be a really easy thing to fix.
[17:49:54] <berpcor|2> I'll do it dynamic.
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> then you could use .forEach() instead and you wouldn't have this problem.
[17:50:47] * Demonen duct tapes jorbin to the wall.
[17:50:51] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: I think it is not problem at all to use array here...
[17:51:11] <berpcor|2> But what about my current variant?.. )
[17:51:20] <berpcor|2> I am interested
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> so first of all change for (i = 1; i <= 7; i++) { to for (var i = 1; i <= 7; i++) {
[17:52:15] <robertmaxrees> and then try, in the .load() callback, something like var currentIndex = i; then use currentIndex instead of i within that function
[17:52:44] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could create a function that handles the whole var img = $('<img src="'+mgallery.wardrobe+'/'+i+'.jpg'+'"/>').load(function(){ stuff and pass the index to that instead.
[17:53:24] <berpcor|2> Step by step. 'var' is declaration of variable in current scope instead of global?
[17:53:41] <robertmaxrees> correct.  you should ALWAYS declare with var.
[17:53:47] <robertmaxrees> you should never use global vars.
[17:54:13] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: The reasons not to do it are the same as in php?
[17:54:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't know PHP so I can't really answer that.
[17:58:25] <berpcor|2> I followed your first directive.
[17:58:31] <berpcor|2> Not alternative.
[17:58:55] <berpcor|2> It not helped me.
[18:02:45] <berpcor|2> Ok, I understand, too many questions. ) Nevertheless, thank you very much for help. I'll try all variants.
[18:02:50] <Demonen> berpcor|2: I'm having trouble grasping your problem with the join/quit spam. Will you re-state it, please?
[18:03:22] <berpcor|2> http://jsbin.com/firijubuse/edit?html,js,output
[18:03:23] <robertmaxrees> Demonen basically, they were using the number from a for loop to do something inside of a .load()
[18:03:44] <robertmaxrees> but they were getting 7 (the final number) for everything after the callback fired.
[18:04:14] <robertmaxrees> they just need to get the number into the load callback scope.
[18:04:48] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/pigikamele/edit?html,js,output
[18:05:47] <robertmaxrees> no
[18:05:48] <Demonen> Function definition is inside the loop. Move it outside and refer to it instead.
[18:06:06] <robertmaxrees> berpcor|2 for loops don't have scope.
[18:06:15] <robertmaxrees> and i told you to put that var INSIDE the callback.
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> Demonen one thing at a time :)
[18:06:31] <robertmaxrees> they need to get the scoping problem first.
[18:07:05] <berpcor|2> Oh, I understood.
[18:07:08] <robertmaxrees> berpcor https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qvh4oabj/
[18:07:24] <robertmaxrees> though Demonen has a very salient point that we'll talk about in a second.
[18:08:52] <Demonen> Moving the function outside the loop forces a scope re-think. That was my whole angle :-P
[18:09:16] <robertmaxrees> heh, he needs to undestand the scope to begin with.
[18:09:49] <berpcor|2> Ok, I move it outside for loop, but how I'll write it there? Manually for each of 7 images?
[18:09:54] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[18:09:56] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:10:04] <robertmaxrees> this is why i wasn't suggesting that quite yet heh
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> no matter
[18:10:16] <Demonen> Haha, okay, I'll back off.
[18:10:21] <robertmaxrees> you'd write a function that you'd call within the for loop.
[18:10:21] <berpcor|2> )
[18:10:32] <berpcor|2> Oh...
[18:10:35] <robertmaxrees> getAWardrobe(i);
[18:10:37] <Demonen> berpcor|2: robertmaxrees and I were attacking it from completely different angles. Sorry I made it confusing for you.
[18:11:11] <robertmaxrees> heh, going to get to the same end result though.
[18:11:14] <berpcor|2> Sorry? ) Now sorries. You are tried and trying to help )
[18:11:18] <berpcor|2> *No
[18:11:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to save you some guesswork on this one: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ny3vku7w/1/
[18:12:31] <robertmaxrees> though that return isn't in a very good place.
[18:12:36] <robertmaxrees> and that's where this gets REALLY confusing :)
[18:12:44] <robertmaxrees> because now var r = mgallery.getAllWardrobeData(); doesn't work.
[18:12:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:14:38] * Demonen sings a song about magic numbers
[18:16:00] <berpcor|2> https://jsfiddle.net/qvh4oabj/1/
[18:17:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:17:34] <robertmaxrees> sure, but you're confusing vars again.
[18:17:37] <robertmaxrees> for loops don't have scope.
[18:17:45] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need curIndex
[18:17:50] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle i sent.
[18:18:13] <robertmaxrees> but this approach won't work without you reworking lots of other code because you need to start using deferreds./
[18:18:29] <robertmaxrees> because you can't use return result; that way.
[18:20:46] <berpcor|2> Yes, I get error )
[18:20:59] <berpcor|2> Why I can't return that way? )
[18:21:06] <berpcor|2> *use return
[18:21:19] <robertmaxrees> because .load() is asynchronous.
[18:21:31] <robertmaxrees> and the callback isn't returning to the function you think it is.
[18:21:31] <berpcor|2> Oh, yes.
[18:22:19] <berpcor|2> So it returns to... nowhere?
[18:22:28] <robertmaxrees> it returns to jquery.
[18:22:31] <robertmaxrees> you can't capture it.
[18:22:50] <robertmaxrees> and wouldn't want to anyway - being able to return out of an ajax call like that would lock the browser with current javascript.
[18:23:48] <berpcor|2> Well... yes, async functions were created for different purposes...
[18:23:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:24:00] <berpcor|2> It is not target use...
[18:24:01] <robertmaxrees> that's nopt realy way.
[18:24:02] <robertmaxrees> but oaky.
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:24:04] <robertmaxrees> *why
[18:24:18] <berpcor|2> ))
[18:24:36] <robertmaxrees> it's because the browser would have to stop everything it's doing and wait for the call to finish before it'd know what to do next.
[18:24:40] <berpcor|2> I need a good course of javascript... )
[18:24:49] <robertmaxrees> what does )) mean?
[18:25:49] <berpcor|2> Or some good book.
[18:27:07] <berpcor|2> And what if...
[18:27:18] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[18:27:29] <robertmaxrees> this is a good basic tutorial for jquery with some general js stuff thrown in.
[18:29:15] <berpcor|2> What if my array of data won't be formed by the time I need it (as load is async), what if there would be some problem about getting access to files? Is that possible?
[18:29:37] <robertmaxrees> right, so the real way you fix this is learn promises.
[18:31:08] <berpcor|2> https://api.jquery.com/promise/
[18:31:09] <berpcor|2> ?
[18:31:47] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/
[18:31:50] <robertmaxrees> read up on this.
[18:33:24] <berpcor|2> So, the main idea is I won't loose control upon any action?
[18:33:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:33:42] <robertmaxrees> the main idea is you can't execute some things until others have finished.
[18:34:11] <berpcor|2> Interesting...
[18:35:01] <robertmaxrees> so you use promises to control that.
[18:35:47] <berpcor|2> I think that I shouldn't use it in my case. That's why. I do all that stuff when I click on some image. Click initialize jquery plugin (image gallery). So, user will have to wait until all operations will be done...
[18:36:02] <robertmaxrees> except you have to .
[18:36:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise your code will never work.
[18:36:10] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[18:36:35] <berpcor|2> What are the cases for using this functionality?
[18:36:44] <berpcor|2> SOme common examples...
[18:37:28] <berpcor|2> When I need async operations and I need they would be executed one by one.
[18:37:29] <robertmaxrees> when using ajax.
[18:37:31] <robertmaxrees> which you're doing.
[18:37:36] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:37:42] <robertmaxrees> yours don't need to be done one by one.
[18:37:48] <robertmaxrees> you just need to know when all are done.
[18:38:05] <berpcor|2> All or each of them?
[18:38:25] <robertmaxrees> in your case?  all.
[18:38:48] <berpcor|2> You are a good teacher, you know?...
[18:38:55] <robertmaxrees> lol thanks.
[18:40:04] <berpcor|2> One more thing. Probably, this thing is not connected to what we are talking about, nevertheless...
[18:41:27] <berpcor|2> I have a button 'add-to-cart' which becomes 'remove-from-cart' after clicking it. What if I click it repeatedly many times? What will happend?
[18:41:54] <berpcor|2> In case if I do not block button until previous action is finished.
[18:42:06] <robertmaxrees> i have no way of knowing.
[18:42:37] <berpcor|2> I mean... All those clicks are put into queue? Or...
[18:42:49] <berpcor|2> Or actions are parallel.
[18:43:07] <berpcor|2> And each action will work with current state of object.
[18:43:15] <robertmaxrees> i have no way of knowing.
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what your code does.
[18:44:22] <berpcor|2> add-to-cart: check availability, decrease number of available goods by 1
[18:44:28] <robertmaxrees> is that through ajax?
[18:44:30] <robertmaxrees> or...?
[18:44:33] <robertmaxrees> (show me some code)
[18:44:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:44:56] <berpcor|2> Moment...
[18:49:27] <berpcor|2> http://pastebin.com/k527EzGK
[18:50:01] <robertmaxrees> every time you click that button, another ajax call is made.
[18:50:26] <robertmaxrees> it could stack up a bunch and have them all basically fire in parallel or be offset by a little bit of time.
[18:50:34] <robertmaxrees> you should really disable the button while the submit is happening.
[18:51:31] <berpcor|2> So, unpredictable result...
[18:51:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:51:50] <berpcor|2> I can have goods more than I actually have...
[18:52:10] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[18:52:13] <berpcor|2> Or vice versa...
[18:52:21] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how all your code works.
[18:52:33] <robertmaxrees> but at the end of the day your stuff is unpredictable.
[18:52:36] <robertmaxrees> which is bad.
[18:53:08] <berpcor|2> Disabling button is a good idea. I do it every time. But I had a thoughts...
[18:53:38] <berpcor|2> It blocks for some time, so you can't change its state fast, you make the client to wait...
[18:53:50] <robertmaxrees> right. until the call is done.
[18:54:25] <berpcor|2> I thought that all calls are queued. But that has no sense. Ajax calls are async...
[18:54:38] <robertmaxrees> they're "sort of" queued, but now you're getting into UX.
[18:54:38] <berpcor|2> So queue exists.
[18:54:42] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[18:54:49] <berpcor|2> But there is no order of execution.
[18:55:02] <robertmaxrees> there's no guarantee depending on a few factors.
[18:55:08] <robertmaxrees> it's more of a UX issue - the end user needs feedback that the click did something.
[18:56:31] <berpcor|2> I meant order exists but order of execution in backend, so to speak, does not equals to order of actions that user made...
[18:56:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[18:56:50] <robertmaxrees> seriously though it's more of a ux issue.
[18:57:06] <robertmaxrees> the user should know that the thing they did initiated some other actiona nd they should probably wait.
[18:57:11] <berpcor|2> Yes, indeed...
[18:57:33] <berpcor|2> So, no changes. I continue to block buttons )
[18:57:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah, block until the ajax is done.
[18:57:58] <berpcor|2> What time is it now in your place? )
[18:58:05] <robertmaxrees> 3:58pm
[18:58:14] <berpcor|2> Night too )
[18:58:33] <robertmaxrees> more like late afternoon, but sure.
[18:58:58] <berpcor|2> Oh, 15.58
[18:59:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:59:47] <berpcor|2> Here is 5.59 am )
[18:59:55] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.  why so early?
[19:00:00] <berpcor|2> So I thought I am lucky that you are not sleeping )
[19:00:14] <berpcor|2> Siberia, Russia )
[19:00:26] <robertmaxrees> no i mean why are you up that early?
[19:00:37] <raul782> Hi guys, I'm trying to use x-editable plugin inside a form, but since this plugin inserts its own form, I get an error with my validation rules: jquery.validate.min.js?v13:4 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined, Is there a way to avoid this, or maybe another plugin that doesn't embed a form.
[19:00:41] <berpcor|2> Up? I dodn't sleep yet )
[19:00:48] <berpcor|2> *didn't
[19:00:54] <robertmaxrees> berpcor why not?
[19:01:07] <berpcor|2> Code do not allow me to sleep )
[19:01:30] <robertmaxrees> berpcor you should really get some sleep.  not sleeping makes you far less productive.
[19:01:45] <berpcor|2> Yes, that's true...
[19:01:46] <robertmaxrees> raul782 why are you using x-editable in a form in the first place?
[19:02:47] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Can I ask you an impudent question?
[19:03:00] <raul782> because the current form was built to store a transaction order,
[19:03:12] <robertmaxrees> you can ask.  whether or not i answer is a different question berpcor
[19:03:27] <deryco> how big is your weiner?
[19:03:40] <robertmaxrees> deryco not funny or appropriate ;)
[19:03:40] <deryco> in pixels
[19:03:43] <raul782> robertmaxrees: but now, the client wants to add an additional note, that is not related to the transaction item, but related to the client account
[19:04:33] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: How often are you here? Is there any other way to get in touch with you?
[19:04:42] <robertmaxrees> berpcor i'm here most weekdays.
[19:04:46] <robertmaxrees> but don't look for only me.
[19:04:59] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of people that can help you in here pretty regularly.
[19:05:19] <robertmaxrees> plus asking in the channel will allow others to chime in and learn from your experiences.
[19:05:29] <berpcor|2> But not all of them patient and are able to explain )
[19:05:38] <robertmaxrees> berpcor heh, sorry man.
[19:05:40] <raul782> so in summary, I was looking maybe to embed an input and once the user saves the content, I can use an external form to store the content and send an ajax to store that note
[19:05:40] <robertmaxrees> those are the breaks.
[19:06:00] <robertmaxrees> raul782 are you using x-editable just for the tooltip-style thing it pops up?
[19:06:06] <raul782> but x-editable always adds this form, which is messing up with my parent form
[19:06:11] <raul782> inline
[19:06:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:06:30] <robertmaxrees> so you just want the click-to-edit part?
[19:06:34] <raul782> yep,
[19:06:47] <robertmaxrees> depending on some details, you could probably build that yourself.
[19:07:21] <robertmaxrees> render out a hidden input that you toggle display on it and the link.
[19:07:48] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: I knew the answer, I am not sure that I would answer in a different way ) Just asked )
[19:08:11] <robertmaxrees> berpcor it's more a matter of needing to maintain a personal life and be able to disconnect :)
[19:08:34] <robertmaxrees> but the other part is also really salient - let others try to help you.
[19:08:44] <raul782> yeah, that was my last option, I was hoping to use any plugin that did the job, lazy-me :/
[19:08:51] <robertmaxrees> raul782 nah not lazy.
[19:09:00] <robertmaxrees> but you really not need all the features of something like x-editable.
[19:09:09] <robertmaxrees> you could look for a click-to-edit plugin on google maybe?
[19:10:44] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Exactly. ) Some people I get in touch with are asking too much, anytime they want. )  But... I hope they will not refuse when I'll need their help, that's the only thing I console myself )
[19:10:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:11:01] <robertmaxrees> either way, just ask here.
[19:11:06] <robertmaxrees> you should have a pretty good success rate.
[19:11:49] <berpcor|2> Besides, thank you very much for help. )
[19:11:49] <raul782> robertmaxrees: thanks, I'll build my own for now, it will be faster, already wasted one hour trying to fit the other plugins.
[19:11:57] <robertmaxrees> raul782 :) fair enough.
[19:12:04] <robertmaxrees> berpcor definitely :)
[19:16:13] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: About my issue again. As I said user have to wait of initialisation of gallery after clicking the image. In fact, I load images only for getting its size. I can handel it using php by inserting data to code.
[19:16:17] <berpcor|2> This is one way.
[19:16:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:16:38] <berpcor|2> What is pure js way?
[19:16:41] <berpcor|2> Preload?
[19:16:43] <robertmaxrees> don't generate js using php.
[19:16:43] <berpcor|2> Or...
[19:16:54] <berpcor|2> Ok, got it. I won't, then...
[19:17:03] <robertmaxrees> "pure js" would be to stick an array of links into the page and .forEach() through them.
[19:17:15] <berpcor|2> I need do it automatically after dom is ready?
[19:17:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:17:27] <robertmaxrees> you can load them on demand.
[19:18:00] <berpcor|2> On demand - yes. But again, user should wait.
[19:18:07] <berpcor|2> What if...
[19:18:10] <robertmaxrees> what is the user waiting on?
[19:18:25] <robertmaxrees> like, what are you building?
[19:18:28] <robertmaxrees> and image gallery?
[19:18:30] <robertmaxrees> *an
[19:18:35] <berpcor|2> $(document).ready(function(){doActionsForInitializingGallery()})
[19:18:51] <robertmaxrees> you could shorten that to $(document).ready(doActionsForInitializingGallery)
[19:18:56] <robertmaxrees> so it's an image gallery?
[19:18:58] <berpcor|2> So that, when user will click image, gallery will be ready.
[19:18:59] <robertmaxrees> is it a carousel?
[19:19:14] <berpcor|2> No.
[19:19:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:19:31] <robertmaxrees> so then what is it?
[19:20:06] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: http://photoswipe.com/
[19:20:21] <robertmaxrees> that also uses a carousel.
[19:20:24] <robertmaxrees> when you expand them.
[19:20:47] <berpcor|2> Well, yes...
[19:21:01] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing this dynamically on the frontend then?
[19:21:04] <robertmaxrees> why not just put in your js?
[19:21:08] <robertmaxrees> err, html?
[19:22:06] <robertmaxrees> like, why are you building things via js?
[19:22:16] <berpcor|2> I read documentation and the first way of initialization I found was js. )
[19:22:29] <robertmaxrees> right, to initialize it, but you're doing some really strange stuff in your code.
[19:22:31] <robertmaxrees> like using .load9)
[19:22:32] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:22:35] <berpcor|2> I see docs now and I can't see any other way of init...
[19:22:51] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Just for getting size of image.
[19:22:58] <robertmaxrees> >.> why?
[19:23:00] <berpcor|2> Plugin can't do it by himself.
[19:23:11] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the size?
[19:23:17] <berpcor|2> And it needs width and height.
[19:23:29] <berpcor|2> It doesn't work without it. I checked.
[19:23:30] <robertmaxrees> you give it a specific width or height to use.
[19:23:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you should supply that information from the server-side.
[19:23:44] <robertmaxrees> not via js.
[19:24:33] <berpcor|2> Besides, a good question. Why there is now way to init via html... I'll ask on github
[19:24:47] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:24:47] <berpcor|2> It is rather common...
[19:24:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:24:53] <robertmaxrees> the js init isn't your issue.
[19:25:08] <robertmaxrees> and it's pretty barebones.
[19:25:11] <robertmaxrees> which is fine.
[19:26:03] <berpcor|2> Then... you said I should use php to form a js code.
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> if you want a more fully featured gallery, there are plenty out there.
[19:26:07] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:26:09] <berpcor|2> Extra ajax call then?
[19:26:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:26:21] <berpcor|2> *shouldn't
[19:26:24] <robertmaxrees> you should output JSON from your PHP that has the relevant data.
[19:27:13] <berpcor|2> Click image->ajax call for getting json data about images -> init gallery ->show gallery?
[19:27:34] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:27:42] <robertmaxrees> just print it onto the page when the page loads.
[19:28:00] <berpcor|2> So... use php to form js?
[19:28:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:28:03] <robertmaxrees> JSON.
[19:28:08] <robertmaxrees> just an object.
[19:28:20] <robertmaxrees> the php won't touch logic - that code should be in a separate js file.
[19:28:27] <berpcor|2> <script>var json={...}</script>
[19:28:33] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:28:33] <berpcor|2> ?
[19:28:38] <berpcor|2> Got it.
[19:29:09] <berpcor|2> Strange plugin... ) I used many, but such a strange plugin I see the first time...
[19:29:15] <robertmaxrees> why are you using it?
[19:29:34] <berpcor|2> Mobile, touch friendly.
[19:29:42] <berpcor|2> There are not so many of them...
[19:29:56] <robertmaxrees> carousels are a bad UX concept fwiw.
[19:29:57] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[19:31:45] <berpcor|2> There is one more strange thing that makes this little 'system' more difficult...
[19:32:16] <berpcor|2> All code is in separate js file. I need to insert json using php in my view... )
[19:32:35] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[19:32:36] <berpcor|2> As separate js files are not handled by php...
[19:32:42] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[19:32:53] <berpcor|2> Is this a good practice?..
[19:33:00] <robertmaxrees> var myImageData = {}; then just access myImageData elsewhere.
[19:33:23] <robertmaxrees> traditionally you'd do something like var myNameSpace = {}; then add properties to that and access through that.
[19:38:00] <berpcor|2> robertmaxrees: Finally, its working. )
[19:38:06] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[19:38:09] <robertmaxrees> glad to hear.
[19:39:33] <berpcor|2> But.. without json object for now. It is 6.38am already, so json will be not now )
[19:39:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:41:59] <berpcor|2> Code become more... neat. Beautiful...
[19:42:29] <berpcor|2> It was worth it...
[19:46:06] <grkblood> anyone in here use hulu via a browser? i promise this relates to jquery
[19:48:14] <Demonen> I don't, but perhaps if you explain the problem someone can help you anyway.
[19:48:24] <Demonen> jQuery pretty much works the same with or without hulu.
[19:49:43] <berpcor|2> Thanks to everyone for help. ) I'll get some sleep. )
[19:49:50] <grkblood> whenever you click on a video in hulu the url changes and the page changes position but I can't seem to find out what event to listen to for the trigger. neither hashchange or document.ready work
[19:49:50] <Demonen> Sleep well
[19:49:59] <berpcor|2> Thanks. )
[19:50:49] <Demonen> grkblood: That's simply pushing the new URL to the history and scrolling a little.
[19:51:41] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API
[19:51:42] <grkblood> so how to you monitor that?
[19:51:50] <Demonen> AFAIK, you don't.
[19:51:50] <robertmaxrees> look at what i just linked :)
[19:51:56] <robertmaxrees> you can actually :)
[19:52:06] <grkblood> thanks
[19:52:12] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#The_popstate_event
[19:52:19] <robertmaxrees> browser support is pretty bad though
[19:52:20] <robertmaxrees> you ymmv
[19:52:23] <robertmaxrees> *so
[19:52:46] <robertmaxrees> well, by "pretty bad" i mean "ie 9 and below" which can be a dealbreaker for some folks.
[19:53:20] <grkblood> i couldnt care less about anything ie
[19:53:25] <robertmaxrees> heh, you should.
[19:53:30] <robertmaxrees> lots of users out there on it :)
[19:53:33] <Demonen> Right, then the popstate event is relevant.
[19:53:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:54:05] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy stuff to work with.
[19:54:32] <Demonen> Back when I wrote software for $huge_techsupport_company I had to allow for IE6. This was in ~2010
[19:54:39] <robertmaxrees> i have to support IE8.
[19:55:56] <Demonen> From what I hear, they still use IE6 for their internal stuff.
[19:56:11] <robertmaxrees> the aforementioned company?
[19:56:14] <Demonen> I just feel blessed I don't work there anymore.
[19:56:15] <Demonen> Yeah.
[19:56:26] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[19:56:33] <robertmaxrees> i worked at a place with a similar problem.
[19:56:38] <robertmaxrees> weird activex controls and stuff.
[19:56:51] <robertmaxrees> alright i gotta jet. enjoy folk.
[19:56:54] <robertmaxrees> *folks
[19:56:56] <Demonen> Have fun
[20:23:14] <Synthead> in jquery ui, when creating a dialog with buttons, can I make those buttons with <a> tags instead of <button> tags?
[20:23:45] <Synthead> I could do something crufty with the create option, but I would greatly prefer not to implement hacky stuff that mutates the button after
