[02:12:48] <loginoob> http://lpaste.net/361710 In this only the div with 'id=ship-block' is appended. But is there a way to append another html element after the last dynamically appended element
[02:15:17] <Woet> loginoob: why dont you just add all your HTML at once?
[02:15:50] <Woet> loginoob: anyways, it works fine when you give it valid HTML. check your syntax.
[02:16:25] <Woet> loginoob: look at the HTML it puts in ship-block for a hint.
[02:16:56] <robertmaxrees> woah yeah do that all at once.
[02:17:04] <Woet> loginoob: or use an IDE with syntax highlighting, you'd find out instantly.
[02:17:33] <Woet> loginoob: https://s.woet.me/DomYdudwSn.png
[02:18:09] <robertmaxrees> loginoob fwiw you can't post lone opening tags.
[02:18:59] <loginoob> Woet: I cannot add all at one because that is in BackboneJS render function
[02:19:09] <robertmaxrees> loginoob and?
[02:19:42] <loginoob> and I need to append to the div with id=ship-block
[02:19:53] <robertmaxrees> you can make that one string and append it all at once.
[02:20:11] <loginoob> how
[02:20:23] <loginoob> oh o
[02:20:24] <loginoob> ok
[02:20:46] <Woet> loginoob: you will still have to fix your invalid HTML
[02:21:01] <Cork> thinking about using a template might be worth too
[02:21:13] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[02:21:22] <robertmaxrees> both of these.
[02:21:23] <loginoob> Woet: yes, I don't understand what is invalid in it. Please tell me
[02:21:33] <robertmaxrees> loginoob you're missing a closing quote.
[02:21:40] <Woet> loginoob: [15:16:24]  <Woet>	loginoob: look at the HTML it puts in ship-block for a hint.
[02:21:41] <Woet> loginoob: [15:17:03]  <Woet>	loginoob: or use an IDE with syntax highlighting, you'd find out instantly.
[02:21:44] <Woet> loginoob: [15:17:32]  <Woet>	loginoob: https://s.woet.me/DomYdudwSn.png
[02:21:47] <Cork> loginoob: dom uses notes not html tags, so you can't have incomplete nodes
[02:21:54] <Cork> notes==nodes
[02:21:57] <robertmaxrees> <div class="mdl-stepper-horizontal-alternative id="ship-block"></div>
[02:22:02] <loginoob> Oh in class
[02:22:02] <robertmaxrees> that class is missing a closing quote.
[02:22:10] <loginoob> ok thanks for that
[02:22:15] <robertmaxrees> but also: you have opening tags without closing tags.
[02:23:03] <Woet> robertmaxrees: i'd rather loginoob is taught how to find missing quotes so they don't have to come back here each time it happens
[02:23:35] <robertmaxrees> no need to backseat mod duder.
[02:23:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:23:50] <Woet> robertmaxrees: it's not moderating.
[02:23:55] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[02:24:04] <robertmaxrees> whatevs meng.
[02:24:07] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[02:25:31] <loginoob> Missing " was not the main problem.
[02:25:44] <robertmaxrees> that'll still prevent your code from running.
[02:25:59] <loginoob> Still it does not append to dymanic div having id=ship-block
[02:26:13] <robertmaxrees> make the changes that were suggested.
[02:26:16] <robertmaxrees> and it'll work better.
[02:26:28] <loginoob> So putting it whole to one string would be better then?
[02:26:28] <robertmaxrees> you're doing far too much templating using jquery here.
[02:27:03] <Woet> loginoob: works fine here, https://jsfiddle.net/ggmgw490/3/
[02:27:13] <Woet> loginoob: but follow the advice you've been given instead
[02:27:24] <undefined_bob> morning
[02:27:30] <Woet> The date & time is currently: Wednesday, 17 January 2018 at 15:27:29
[02:27:35] <loginoob> ok ty all
[02:28:12] <Cork> loginoob: this is what i recommend https://jsfiddle.net/pkv0hsdb/
[02:33:41] <loginoob> Cork: I was not doing that because I need that whole n number of times depending on some Backbone logic
[02:34:05] <Cork> loginoob: and that works with that code
[02:34:14] <Cork> just run the code again and append it where ever you want it
[02:34:31] <Cork> and that code doesn't create duplicate ids either
[02:34:53] <loginoob> ok i'll try to implement it. Thank you
[02:35:41] <Woet> Cork: another person helped without insulting them
[02:35:44] <Woet> i'm on a streak apparently
[02:41:17] <loginoob> why would someone insult
[03:16:56] <hellyeah> hey i just got maximum call stack error what am i doing here wrong?
[03:16:57] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/wvm202jg/11/
[03:17:55] <Cork> call stack errors means you recurs too much
[03:18:29] <hellyeah> actually i know what that means :P
[03:18:50] <robertmaxrees> uh
[03:19:44] <hellyeah> sec
[03:20:05] <hellyeah> i removed that each
[03:20:23] <hellyeah> but i need to replace table to value one by one any idea how can i do that? https://jsfiddle.net/wvm202jg/13/
[03:20:55] <robertmaxrees> duder.
[03:20:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[03:21:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:21:23] <robertmaxrees> start with the end result: what are you looking to end up with?
[03:21:44] <robertmaxrees> your first fiddle was lolbroken.  do you understand why?
[03:21:46] <hellyeah> i just try to make dynamical table
[03:22:02] <robertmaxrees> *dynamic
[03:22:05] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  so much recurs as Cork  said
[03:22:11] <hellyeah> dynamic table
[03:22:17] <robertmaxrees> so you want to format some data, right?
[03:22:24] <hellyeah> yes
[03:22:31] <robertmaxrees> use a templating engine.
[03:22:39] <robertmaxrees> it'll help you not make the same mistakes.
[03:22:50] <hellyeah> normally i am using template string
[03:22:56] <robertmaxrees> *templating engine.
[03:22:58] <hellyeah> this is just for tring and see things
[03:23:00] <robertmaxrees> not template string.
[03:23:00] <Cork> hellyeah: also $bodytr.append($.map(mData, function(element) { ... $('#outer tr').append(td); }); ??
[03:23:09] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[03:23:17] <Cork> you use $.map with append but doesn't return anything...
[03:23:32] <hellyeah> oh damn i forgot
[03:23:38] <Cork> this entire fiddle is extremely confused...
[03:23:44] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[03:23:50] <robertmaxrees> use a templating engine for this instead.
[03:24:07] <Cork> robertmaxrees: he was given one last week
[03:24:23] <Cork> apparently he has worked his way away from it though
[03:24:29] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah we keep suggesting these tools to you and you keep ignoring them.
[03:24:31] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[03:25:49] <hellyeah> i am fixing smt
[03:25:59] <robertmaxrees> ....
[03:26:07] <robertmaxrees> your stuff is broken because you're not using a templating engine.
[03:28:01] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you using it?
[03:29:32] <hellyeah> i am gonna use that
[03:29:41] * hellyeah hate the change design of code
[03:29:43] <robertmaxrees> why weren't you already?
[03:31:17] <hellyeah> i did some laziness
[03:31:40] <robertmaxrees> then stop being lazy ;)
[03:31:56] <robertmaxrees> people keep solving these problems for you and you keep having them week after week.
[03:32:14] <Cork> and to be a bit frank, lazy ness that means something that should be fairly simple has taken you three weeks
[03:32:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[03:32:34] <robertmaxrees> like, even my patience is running out here.
[03:32:50] <Woet> thats possible?
[03:33:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[03:33:39] <robertmaxrees> brb
[03:37:37] <robertmaxrees> back
[03:53:53] <hellyeah> i just ued template string as robertmaxrees  mentioned everything seems ok now https://jsfiddle.net/wvm202jg/15/
[03:54:10] <robertmaxrees> *template
[03:54:16] <robertmaxrees> *as cork and others have mentioned.
[03:55:04] <hellyeah> yeah sorry
[03:55:53] <hellyeah> but something wrong here
[03:57:03] <sowerby> Hi - I'm using $.ajax to make a request to an nginx server which acts as a reverse proxy to a python web app.
[03:57:34] <sowerby> I can use the statusCode { 404: function} to handle 401, 500 etc
[03:58:02] <sowerby> but if the python app is not running - I'm getting a 502 bad gateway from an OPTIONS request rather than my GET - how do I handle this?
[03:58:39] <Cork> sowerby: are you doing cross domain requests to this url?
[03:58:48] <Cork> posts or patch to be specific
[03:59:20] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what's wrong?
[03:59:21] <Cork> cause in those cases the browser makes OPTIONS calls to the domain and not script
[03:59:32] <sowerby> ooh yes I am, although only for the sake of being able to test locally
[03:59:34] <Cork> so javascript can't handle it at all
[03:59:49] <sowerby> I've got an enable CORS extension on chrome to let it do it
[04:01:31] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  i am working on it
[04:02:47] <sowerby> Cork - I'm unfamiliar with OPTIONS calls at all really
[04:03:45] <Cork> sowerby: when a site makes a cors post/patch (modify verb) the browser makes an OPTIONS call asking the site if it should allow the call
[04:04:04] <Cork> unless the server answers with a response saying it allows it the browser won't allow the post
[04:04:16] <sowerby> ah okay, so in my $.ajax, I'm just trying to handle the GET request
[04:04:31] <Cork> then you shouldn't get any options calls
[04:04:42] <Cork> this page explains it fairly well https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[04:05:00] <sowerby> Thank you
[04:07:25] <sowerby> Cork - I'm still going to read this page, but I've just tested it with the site in the proper place rather than on my laptop and it works okay:)
[04:07:28] <sowerby> Thank you!
[04:07:40] <sowerby> The help is much appreciated
[04:07:42] <Cork> np
[04:10:50] <neredsenvy> I have index.html and content.html I'm trying to load content.html into index.html div. I have jq included. $(document).ready(... $('#content').load("header.html"); ..);
[04:11:01] <neredsenvy> This gives me: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension
[04:11:08] <neredsenvy> Yet it's loading file from same disk/domain
[04:11:20] <Cork> neredsenvy: cors requests aren't allowed for file://
[04:11:31] <Cork> use a webserver for development
[04:12:03] <neredsenvy> Is there another way I can load external html file into index ?
[04:12:13] <hellyeah> hey i am sorry what is the mistake i made here? https://jsfiddle.net/wvm202jg/18/
[04:12:13] <Cork> no, not if it is on file://
[04:13:08] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what's the issue?
[04:14:57] <hellyeah> there is no error on console
[04:15:04] <robertmaxrees> ....
[04:15:05] <robertmaxrees> and?
[04:15:06] <Woet> that's the opposite of an issue
[04:15:15] <hellyeah> let me finish robertmaxrees
[04:15:19] <robertmaxrees> what's the expected result and what are you getting instead?
[04:15:41] <hellyeah> i am expecting to append "element" as td of outer table
[04:15:53] <hellyeah> well i coudltn suceed that
[04:16:13] <robertmaxrees> you're appending data there.
[04:16:18] <robertmaxrees> sooo what's missing?
[04:16:39] <Anticom> Hi all. I'm trying to implement a somewhat automatic polling interval calculation so i get the fastest possible polling interval w/o using too many parrallel requests. https://jsfiddle.net/md0z8wze/ this is what i came up with
[04:16:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:17:55] <Anticom> however when looking at the network panel of chrome debugger the requests do not overlap at all which i would expected them to have since num_connections currently is 5, hence i would expect 5 concurrent requests (approximately) at any given time
[04:18:28] <Anticom> Oh and i know i should use WS instead of polling yada yada. I know, however i first need to get things working before i got time to rewrite everything from scratch :)
[04:19:02] <robertmaxrees> Anticom why are you trying to do 5 concurrent requests?
[04:19:07] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[04:19:19] <Cork> Anticom: browsers has a max connection per domain setting
[04:19:43] <Cork> also if you want the data quick, might be better to think about using something like websocket and pushing the updates
[04:19:44] <Anticom> robertmaxrees: i want to be somewhat on the safe side: https://stackoverflow.com/a/985704/966530
[04:19:52] <Anticom> Cork: i know
[04:20:40] <Anticom> Cork: I just wrote that i'm totally aware of websockets. However our (embedded) server can't be adopted that easily. Since i need a solution ASAP i need to roll with XHR polling *for now*
[04:20:57] <Anticom> If i got this sorted i got myself some more time to get WS working in the backend
[04:21:53] <hellyeah> i saw my mistake
[04:21:54] <Cork> still leaves the question why you would want multiple connections for the polling
[04:21:59] <hellyeah> td is not there
[04:22:18] <Cork> Anticom: btw the data on that so is OLD and not correct anymore
[04:22:22] <Anticom> Cork: because i want the interval to be as minimal as possible (it's about "real-time" data)
[04:22:43] <Cork> Anticom: then just make a constant request loop
[04:22:48] <Anticom> Cork: it was just the first result google came up with. I'm not using that SO for reference :)
[04:23:07] <Anticom> Cork: i can't due to chaning network conditions
[04:23:12] <Cork> O_o'
[04:23:14] <Anticom> it needs to be somewhat flexible
[04:23:19] <Cork> wat?
[04:23:31] <Anticom> Cork: don't ask, just accept ;)
[04:23:37] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[04:23:45] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just do recursive ajax calls?
[04:24:00] <Anticom> TL;DR; i can't figure out what's wrong with my proof of concept
[04:24:50] <hellyeah> it seems you cannot append element to the template
[04:24:51] <Anticom> Can we please only discuss what's wrong with that instead of giving me ideas how to do things differently? I know you are all right, however atm I just *can't* do anything else but have to stick with that idea (or at least something similar)
[04:25:04] <Anticom> Please don't feel offended by that. It hurts myself aswell
[04:26:30] <Anticom> Cork: to give a little more context: The webserver is likely to be accessed via 3g/4g network while the device hosting the server is driving arround in a car
[04:26:40] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  can you give me tips?
[04:26:54] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah on what?
[04:27:04] <Cork> Anticom: and why does that means you need to make 5 ajax calls at one time to poll for data updates?
[04:27:31] <Cork> if anything it should mean you should be extra restrictive with how much data you request
[04:27:34] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  what did i do wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/wvm202jg/18/
[04:27:43] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's not a problem statement.
[04:27:54] <hellyeah> pff
[04:27:57] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen vs what is actually happening?
[04:27:57] <hellyeah> nevermind then
[04:28:07] <hellyeah> i just give up
[04:28:20] <Anticom> Cork: I'd like to run them in some sort of casscade. With mobile networks often only the latency is a problem. So if i can casscade a couple of requests i'm getting a faster update rate
[04:28:42] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  i i expect to see the content i cannot add element
[04:28:44] <hellyeah> thats all
[04:28:48] <hellyeah> nevermind
[04:28:55] <robertmaxrees> you're adding elements tho.
[04:29:16] <hellyeah> yeah
[04:29:34] <hellyeah> dang
[04:29:34] <Anticom> ew, i see the issue now
[04:29:47] <Anticom> the timeout only is set whenever the previous complete callback is called
[04:29:48] <Anticom> ._.
[04:41:45] <hellyeah> can you help me to find issue here i just try to append some element to the table https://jsfiddle.net/wvm202jg/19/
[04:43:25] <Anticom> hellyeah: I'd use <template> over that script thingamabob to begin with https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[04:45:09] <Woet> hellyeah: what have you done so far to debug it?
[04:45:09] <Anticom> hellyeah: and then you probably want to iterate over your data (using a for...of loop https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of ) and append a new cell / row / etc. in each iteration
[04:45:44] <hellyeah> i used map
[04:48:22] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah so what isn't happening that you're expecting?
[04:48:55] <hellyeah> i just expect to append some element that i created
[04:49:12] <hellyeah> but i think i cannot append to element to template
[04:49:17] <robertmaxrees> you realize you're not doing anything with your data, right?
[04:49:22] <robertmaxrees> $('body').append($.map(mData, function(element) {
[04:49:25] <hellyeah> because in the dom it is not visible what i added
[04:49:28] <robertmaxrees> you never use element here
[04:49:45] <hellyeah> no thats not that
[04:49:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wvm202jg/20/ this does the same thing.
[04:49:48] <robertmaxrees> yes, that.
[04:49:49] <hellyeah> i mean i am creating
[04:49:56] <hellyeah> td, tr and append to table
[04:49:57] <robertmaxrees> you never actually use your array.
[04:50:04] <robertmaxrees> you're appending your template.
[04:50:10] <robertmaxrees> the appends all work.
[04:50:30] <hellyeah> when i check the dom i i couldnt see what i added
[04:50:47] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/I8TMKCI.png
[04:50:53] <robertmaxrees> is this not what you see in the results panel?
[04:51:30] <hellyeah> i cannot view imgur
[04:51:59] <robertmaxrees> do you see your headings in the result pane?
[04:52:08] <robertmaxrees> ID, Date Monitor, etc?
[04:53:10] <hellyeah> yes
[04:53:26] <hellyeah> i am not seeing the td and tr i created
[04:53:41] <robertmaxrees> here's a hint: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wvm202jg/21/
[04:53:42] <hellyeah> i just see the markup in the template
[04:54:05] <robertmaxrees> look at that fiddle and compare against yours.
[04:54:59] <hellyeah> i need to lunch
[04:55:05] <hellyeah> i just checkl when i come back
[04:56:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:59:52] <Cork> had enough huh?
[05:00:14] <Cork> or was it a spamer?
[05:00:26] <robertmaxrees> it's been months.
[05:00:32] <Cork> ya i know
[05:00:33] <robertmaxrees> and he needs a break from the channel.
[05:01:03] <Cork> feels like he doesn't make any knowledge progress either
[05:01:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd like to think i'm really tolerant but he keeps skirting things.
[05:01:22] <robertmaxrees> he makes progress very slowly.
[05:01:25] <Cork> each time he asks something he still feels completely green, and he has been here for over a year and a half
[05:01:52] <robertmaxrees> but it's the fact that he doesn't try to figure out why suggested solutions don't work.
[05:01:57] <Cork> ya
[05:02:13] <Cork> feels like what some refer to as a support vampire
[05:02:20] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[05:02:32] <robertmaxrees> he's also had a few "moments" with other people here.
[05:02:45] <robertmaxrees> he then suddenly needs to go to lunch or bed or w/e when we're like "hey think about this"
[05:02:54] <Cork> ya, been there too
[05:03:07] <Cork> feels more like he things he is making us a service by asking questions
[05:03:13] <Cork> *thinks*
[05:04:03] <robertmaxrees> i think he means well.  he's just in over his head.
[05:04:06] <robertmaxrees> and he needs a break for a bit.
[05:04:30] <Cork> he wants to do right; sure it is his attitude i have problem with
[05:04:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[05:04:53] <robertmaxrees> hopefully 24hrs gives him enough time to focus.
[05:05:01] <Cork> hmm
[05:05:07] <Cork> will see
[05:32:27] <hellyeah> hey
[05:35:46] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  honestly i couldnt find the difference
[05:37:01] <hellyeah> oh
[05:37:41] <hellyeah> okey
[05:38:05] <hellyeah> you make clone of template inside map
[05:57:22] <Uhkis> kick reason might've helped
[09:29:02] <Teduardo> If anyone has a moment I am having a problem with a css class being applied to a hidden element rather than the control that is shown to the user. There is a full description of the problem in the fiddle. I would appreciate any help. https://jsfiddle.net/syx16bxp/1/
[09:35:53] <Teduardo> btw i've tried to get a dropdown with functioning validation using 4 different dropdown libraries and 3 different validation libraries. It's really making me want to cry at this point.
[09:36:05] <Cork> cleaned up https://jsfiddle.net/syx16bxp/2/
[09:37:17] <Cork> Teduardo: what is adding that class though?
[09:37:28] <Teduardo> parsley
[09:37:55] <Cork> oh my thats a big blob
[09:38:03] <Cork> never used it so donno how it works
[09:38:42] <Teduardo> i guess does anyone know of a working combination of a dropdown that you can also type in (in the event the list is way too long) and a validation library?
[09:39:01] <Cork> personally i use jquery-ui autocomplete
[09:39:49] <Cork> Teduardo: ex. http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[09:40:34] <Teduardo> and what library do you use to validate it?
[09:41:26] <Cork> i usually don't use validation libs, they need to be very complex to be generic and writing custom validators is easy (about 20 lines of code)
[09:41:33] <Cork> but many use jquery.validator.js
[09:47:41] <Teduardo> Latest jqueryui is compat with latest jquery?
[09:48:31] <Cork> ya
[09:48:47] <Cork> support versions is stated on jqueryui.com
[09:48:55] <Cork> *supported versions*
[09:50:53] <AdamPDotty> Teduardo: might be helpflu: https://github.com/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js/issues/89
[10:01:44] <Teduardo> @Cork: this is a dumb question but I am trying to implement combobox/autocomplete on a test fork and jsfiddle is saying combobox is not a jquery.min.js function (we know this, it's supposed to be a jquery ui function)
[10:02:03] <Teduardo> I have jquery-ui-min.js included in the jsfiddle
[10:02:06] <Cork> Teduardo: check the code example in the demo
[10:02:39] <Cork> *view source
[10:02:58] <Cork> specifically $.widget( "custom.combobox", {
[10:03:06] <Cork> that defines the new plugin for jqueyr ui
[10:04:05] <Teduardo> oh, yeah okay I get it now it's that entire gigantic function above that makes the combobox
[10:04:17] <Cork> ya
[10:04:42] <Cork> it is basically an inline plugin for jquery
[10:49:01] <z1haze> hey all, I have this function here: http://dpaste.com/21KYP3R I am trying to come up with a way not show the dialog content at all (continue showing the loading animation) until all content is loaded, including images.. any thoughts?
[10:49:19] <z1haze> imagesloaded is the imagesloaded lib btw
[10:54:16] <Teduardo> as UI script folks do you prefer flexbox or bootstrap for websites?
[10:54:35] <Teduardo> I'm obviously terrible at front-end/ui so i'm trying to decide what is easier.
[11:16:52] <Teduardo> there is no way to make jsfiddle put something together into a single file right?
[11:24:27] <nckpz> flexbox and bootstrap are totally different. flexbox is a layout mode for CSS and if you're a beginner you'll find it more difficult than Bootstrap most likely. Bootstrap is a full UI framework containing button styles, scripted components, among other things - it's for people who don't want to meticulously craft every little piece of their UI
[11:24:50] <taplar> ...... wut?
[11:25:55] <taplar> ah, nvm, had to look back in the logs for the q.
[11:37:43] <nckpz> should also note that recent versions of bootstrap actually use flexbox under the hood and it's just an easier layer of abstraction so you don't have to worry about cross-browser concerns (or learning how flexbox works in general)
[12:35:04] <damarusama> trying to see if a one of the th in a page contains a string
[12:35:37] <damarusama> $('th:contains("thestring")').each
[12:35:46] <damarusama> does that make sense?
[12:35:53] <taplar> looks valid
[12:48:34] <Guest54834> umm ya
[12:51:08] <Guest54834> i need to come up with a attribute name
[12:51:08] <Guest54834> 17:49 < Guest54834> i have a filter dropdown that id like to use with router or form
[12:51:27] <Guest54834> type=state|form
[12:51:39] <Guest54834> or router|form
[12:52:17] <Guest54834> wat shud i call this attribute
[12:53:05] <Guest54834> dillema of the universes
[12:53:13] <taplar> i'm not clear on what you are asking, but it doesn't sound like a jquery question
[13:49:45] <xinobi> Hi, I'm writing a small function to build modal with action boxes etc and I need to notify the event that builds the modal about any of the three decision possible...
[13:49:56] <xinobi> this is very small https://gist.github.com/obinoob/970daf64c9663b1157d0c0283b76cab4
[13:50:59] <xinobi> I just need a little tea spoon to achieve my goal hope you guys can help me thank you ;)
[13:53:37] <taplar> what are the three decisions?
[13:53:54] <taplar> or is that the line 143 logic?
[14:02:49] <xinobi> taplar: on line 143 after append I need to get the result from one of the following lines: 75, 110, 121 which basically return the close() result of the three buttons when clicked
[14:03:53] <taplar> you understand that events don't really "return", right?
[14:04:08] <taplar> when you return you are returning a value to the caller
[14:04:13] <taplar> which would be the browser
[14:06:02] <xinobi> taplar: well I get that events get stored in browser event queue...
[14:06:50] <taplar> what do you want to happen when one of these three things happen?
[14:07:01] <taplar> cause it looks like they all are doing the same thing.  closing the modal
[14:07:30] <xinobi> taplar: this event get notified $('.action-box').on('click', function () { ... }
[14:07:48] <xinobi> yes for now
[14:07:51] <taplar> that event is long gone by the time the other event happens
[14:08:05] <taplar> which is why i'm asking what you want to happen
[14:10:06] <xinobi> taplar: well, actually despite other things I want to report which button was clicked and depending on that do something
[14:10:32] <taplar> alright, well one quick way to do that would be to give each button a unique class or id
[14:10:37] <taplar> and the user could bind a click event on them
[14:11:43] <taplar> which it looks like you have that already
[14:11:54] <taplar> close/confirm/cancel, if your classes parameter is reflective
[14:12:41] <taplar> you could also optionally allow the users to pass in that logic on the options
[14:12:50] <taplar> a few ui plugins do that
[14:13:15] <taplar> { onClose: ..., onCancel: ..., onConfirm: ... }
[14:13:31] <taplar> which your click handler on each element could invoke
[14:16:09] <taplar> personally with what you have here, i'd go the options route
[14:32:59] <xinobi> taplar: I would like to maintain the template design with the click: event... what you mean with "route" options ? can you give me a small example please?
[14:33:28] <taplar> so for instance, you could allow the user to pass in
[14:33:39] <taplar> { onClose: function(){ console.log('weee'); }}
[14:34:07] <taplar> and in your click event for the close button, before you perform the close logic you could invoke the options.onClose() if it is not null
[14:39:14] <xinobi> taplar: sweet :) https://gist.github.com/obinoob/970daf64c9663b1157d0c0283b76cab4
[14:44:10] <taplar> or that, :)
[14:51:01] <xinobi> taplar: well it works but I get tied to the callback param function right?
[14:53:20] <xinobi> taplar: would it be wise to use promises here? I never used it...
[14:54:25] <taplar> i'd use the options rather than pass it in as an argument
[14:56:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/1jazybxt/
[14:56:51] <taplar> If you don't put it on the options, nothing extra happens
[15:14:20] <xinobi> taplar: I got it! thank you very much appreciate your help :)
[15:14:29] <taplar> np
[16:23:59] <Teduardo> Does anyone know of a website where you can sponsor the correction of a jsfiddle that isn't working?
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo why not fix it yourself?
[16:27:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> or ask about it on SO.
[16:27:42] <robertmaxrees> plenty of free ways to do that.
[16:27:55] <taplar> "sponsor"?
[16:28:27] <Teduardo> Yeah you know, compensate someone financially to just get it off of my plate.
[16:28:38] <taplar> aaah
[16:28:42] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for a contractor.
[16:28:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:29:31] <Teduardo> and SO is dead for the libraries i've posted under
[16:29:40] <robertmaxrees> can we help you fix it?
[16:32:52] <Teduardo> I'm not really sure at this point. I made this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/hbcb0m8e/24/ based upon a published working demo https://jqueryvalidation.org/files/demo/semantic-ui/index.html but he's using inputs and my form has a select and it's just bedlam
[16:33:58] <Teduardo> I've tried 5 different select box plugins with 5 different validator plugins
[16:34:07] <Teduardo> none of them just actually work together
[16:34:14] <robertmaxrees> so you want to validate select boxes with jquery validate?
[16:34:38] <Teduardo> Well, yes but the select box in question is being modified to be a searchbox also
[16:34:39] <robertmaxrees> because if you look at your console, it tells you exactly what your issue is :)
[16:35:41] <robertmaxrees> semantic isn't giving the select a name.
[16:38:13] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:38:41] <robertmaxrees> there are people here duder.
[16:39:28] <Teduardo> Thats cool, i cant control what semantic does so I guess I'll just start over =)
[16:39:45] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo i'd dig around to see how you could fix that particular issue.
[16:39:52] <robertmaxrees> because the rest should be fairly trivial after that.
[16:40:52] <Teduardo> Yeah? I actually came here just to fix the way that the error message displays to the right of the select instead of under it and I have no idea why you have to click in order for it to realize that something has been selected
[16:41:17] <Teduardo> its probably because validator and dropdown are both trying to bind to the same event
[16:41:33] <robertmaxrees> so you want to change the error placement?
[16:41:44] <Teduardo> I am just trying to get it to work like the example at this point
[16:41:50] <Teduardo> that would be like a gigantic win
[16:43:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hbcb0m8e/25/
[16:43:44] <robertmaxrees> you mean like this?
[16:44:12] <Teduardo> Sort of, except when you select an item in the select it should clear the red
[16:44:27] <Teduardo> but instead for some reason you have to click on the error box
[16:44:33] <robertmaxrees> right, so you need to fix the validation.
[16:46:23] <gambl0re> hey robert, we cool?
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:46:37] <robertmaxrees> did you have a question?
[16:46:41] <robertmaxrees> like, related to the topic?
[16:47:00] <gambl0re> what topic
[16:47:05] <robertmaxrees> the channel topic
[16:48:07] <gambl0re> i just wanted to apologize about last time. sorry.
[16:48:12] <gambl0re> i got a little heated.
[16:48:14] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:48:26] * robertmaxrees gives the thumbs up.
[16:48:30] <gambl0re> still friends?
[16:48:38] <robertmaxrees> it's all good duder.,
[16:48:40] <robertmaxrees> let it go :)
[16:49:02] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo iirc jquery validate relies on names on inputs but I could have that totally wrong.
[16:49:03] <gambl0re> cool...so what did you have for lunch?
[16:49:47] <gambl0re> please dont say sushi, cause you always have sushi...
[16:49:56] * robertmaxrees sighs
[16:49:57] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:50:04] <taplar> is that a lady joke?
[16:50:09] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what it is.
[16:50:29] <gambl0re> taplar, usually he has sushi for lunch
[16:50:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:50:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't.
[16:50:57] <Teduardo> Alright so I just told semanticui to not allow search as a test and it still says that the search line has no name even though that no longer appears in the source
[16:50:57] <robertmaxrees> please move on.
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo hummm
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> in the rendered source or in the html pane?
[16:51:22] <robertmaxrees> 'cause those are different things.
[16:51:57] <Teduardo> if i inspect the select and expand all of the arrows
[16:52:13] <robertmaxrees> the select or the divs and stuff that semantic generate?
[16:53:28] <Teduardo> I updated it's 26 now, i removed the search class so it's not even generating that line of code anymore
[16:53:38] <robertmaxrees> hummm./
[16:54:17] <Teduardo> That line is there when you add 'search' to the class list on the select
[16:55:58] <Teduardo> In a different browser that error doesn't appear in the console anymore but you still have to click on the error in order to clear it. I'm pretty sure its because they are both using the same event listeners
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> or they're firing out of order.
[16:56:55] <robertmaxrees> hunting around it seems like most people don'
[16:56:59] <Teduardo> i'm going to just strip the dropdown off and see if it validates at all
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> *don't encounter this much.
[16:57:13] <Teduardo> yeah i'm on day 5... so if it was on google
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> saw a few SO posts about it even :)
[16:58:40] <Teduardo> yea. if i just remove dropdown the validation works perfectly so i guess again these two libraries are not compatible.
[16:58:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:58:59] <robertmaxrees> other people are getting them to work just fine together tho.
[16:59:07] <Teduardo> yeah, input boxes
[16:59:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing examples with this dropdown/searchbox dealio.,
[17:05:24] <Guest54834> what r  u doing here robertmaxrees
[17:05:35] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:05:40] <Guest54834> exactly
[17:05:49] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:05:52] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:06:17] <Guest54834> lelelel
[17:06:28] <gambl0re> Guest40578, what the fuck
[17:06:35] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> chill out dude
[17:06:42] <Guest40578> ?
[17:06:43] <robertmaxrees> it's irssi
[17:06:45] <Guest54834> he started it
[17:07:04] * robertmaxrees sighs
[17:07:07] <Guest54834> oh hey Guest40578
[17:07:12] <Guest54834> r we brothers
[17:07:20] <taplar> this year is weirdly confrontational so far
[17:07:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm not getting it.
[17:07:29] <robertmaxrees> and i'm getting real tired of it.
[17:07:44] <robertmaxrees> the channel has been steadily devolving.
[17:07:50] <Guest54834> ok im taking the initiative to stop
[17:36:52] <gambl0re> figured it out!
[17:37:18] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[17:38:33] <gambl0re> wrong channel..sorry duder
[17:39:00] <z1haze> does imagesloaded work in hidden content?
[17:39:00] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:42:22] <Teduardo> Well, it doesn't appear that there is a way to assign a name to that element..
[17:43:44] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42931594/semantic-ui-form-validation-with-dynamic-dropdowns
[17:43:46] <robertmaxrees> does this help?
[17:44:23] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/appsoa/pen/BoxQeL
[17:45:04] <Teduardo> That seems to be more about dynamically generating a form via semantic
[17:45:54] <Teduardo> and that example is using semantic-ui's own validation
[17:46:01] <Teduardo> not jquery-validator, the library
[17:52:58] <z1haze> I need a way to open a jquery-ui dialog, showing a loader (that part i can do) but I need to fetch my html via ajax, and then after I get the content, I want to make sure I've loaded any images as well, before i replace the dialog content.. I havent been successful
[17:54:08] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo ah
[17:54:21] <taplar> z1haze: so have you broken that down into steps?
[17:54:50] <z1haze> yes. the only part i cant do is get the images to load before i replace the content in the dialog
[17:55:06] <z1haze> my steps are as follows
[17:56:07] <z1haze> 1. open empty dialog. 2. show loading indicator inside. 3. load html via ajax. 4. replace html in dialog. 5. call imagesloaded. 6. reposition dialog in center after images have loaded .. what i want to do is combine 4 and 5 but i dont know how
[17:56:30] <taplar> wouldn't you want to do 5 before 4?
[17:57:39] <taplar> conceptually you're thinking of something like $.when(image1, image2, image3, ....).then(replace html in dialog)
[17:57:53] <taplar> where the things in the when are the promises for the image loading
[17:58:05] <z1haze> but i have to replace the content before i can load the images
[17:58:08] <z1haze> thats the thing
[17:58:15] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[18:00:00] <taplar> quick goggle of "javascript, preload images" should turn up lots of suggestions for you
[18:01:52] <z1haze> why?
[18:02:54] <z1haze> the images have to be in the dom before they can be loaded ,yeah?
[18:03:10] <z1haze> and im just fetching an html page, there may/may not be images
[18:07:55] <robertmaxrees> not with a preloader
[18:16:21] <z1haze> i did this: http://dpaste.com/22HH5F4 and it works
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> where do you delete the preload div?
[18:18:09] <z1haze> here: this.$el.html(this.options.html);
[18:19:54] <z1haze> ?
[18:20:20] <robertmaxrees> that's replacing the contents.
[18:20:25] <robertmaxrees> the #preload element will persis.
[18:20:32] <z1haze> how?
[18:20:35] <robertmaxrees> and you're appending it, so you'll keep creating a new one.
[18:20:45] <z1haze> how will it still exist
[18:21:55] <z1haze> if we have a jquery object $el
[18:21:59] <z1haze> then we append a div to $el
[18:22:13] <z1haze> then do $el.html('') it clear that div
[18:22:23] <robertmaxrees> but #preload still exists.
[18:22:33] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[18:22:33] <robertmaxrees> nvm.
[18:22:35] <robertmaxrees> i gotchu.
[18:22:47] <robertmaxrees> sorry, used to seeing this with pure js preloaders instead of this way :)_
[18:22:51] <robertmaxrees> s'all good :)
[18:22:59] <z1haze> its almost all good
[18:23:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:23:16] <z1haze> what happens if theres some inline javscript in the html that i return to that.. wont that cause it to execute twice? possibly?
[18:23:57] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be getting inline js tho O.o
[18:24:31] <z1haze> yah yah
[18:24:41] <z1haze> just sayin
[18:24:55] <z1haze> i dont think we do, but who knows on this thing man :)
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> do you control where the data is coming from?>
[18:25:25] <robertmaxrees> and where is this.options.html coming from?
[18:25:42] <z1haze> getHtml sets it
[18:25:50] <z1haze> sec
[18:25:52] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:26:17] <z1haze> it will make sense.
[18:26:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing getHTML does an ajax call?
[18:26:18] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/0MCDZQW
[18:26:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:26:39] <z1haze> when creating a dialog instance, there can be a url, or html itself
[18:26:43] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[18:26:50] <z1haze> ... why not
[18:27:53] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/5bbecf65d97b
[18:27:55] <robertmaxrees> just do this.
[18:28:34] <z1haze> i get it, you dont like setting the value in the promise instead of returning it
[18:28:59] <robertmaxrees> right.  no need to do that.
[18:29:11] <z1haze> it literally makes no difference though because is till want to keep it on the object itself, thus this.options.html
[18:29:20] <robertmaxrees> why though?
[18:29:48] <z1haze> maybe to swap content
[18:30:00] <robertmaxrees> then you call getHtml again.
[18:30:19] <z1haze> ok so think of it this way
[18:30:39] <z1haze> err
[18:30:52] <z1haze> ok, we HAVE to pass in either a url, or html on instantiation, yea?
[18:31:05] <z1haze> so if I have to pass that in, shouldnt i keep track of the html?
[18:31:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying the deferred does that for you.
[18:31:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z3ngt6vy/
[18:31:34] <z1haze> yeah, but this.options.html will be out of sync
[18:31:46] <z1haze> i dunno it just feels weird not keeping it in sync
[18:32:02] <z1haze> lets say i create the dialog with some html
[18:32:08] <z1haze> then i change the content, call getHtml again
[18:32:17] <z1haze> then i want to reference, this.options.html, and its wrong
[18:32:21] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:32:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:32:34] <z1haze> seriously.
[18:32:39] <robertmaxrees> you always want the most up-to-date data?
[18:32:46] <z1haze> wouldnt you?
[18:32:52] <robertmaxrees> that all depends on your API.
[18:32:59] <robertmaxrees> so then you don't want this.options.html at all.
[18:33:02] <z1haze> technically no, i dont need it, you're right
[18:33:04] <robertmaxrees> since that data could be stale.,
[18:33:11] <robertmaxrees> so you do always want to make the ajax call.
[18:33:25] <z1haze> ok robertmaxrees if i dont want it at all, where do i store it on instantiation
[18:33:31] <z1haze> if there's no url and we're just passing it html
[18:33:33] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to store it at all?
[18:33:38] <z1haze> for that very reason
[18:33:44] <robertmaxrees> bnecause there's no ajax call?
[18:33:50] <z1haze> yep
[18:33:58] <robertmaxrees> you pass it to the resolve.
[18:34:02] <robertmaxrees> see the fiddle I just shared?
[18:34:13] <z1haze> lol yea.. and you're not passing any data in the resolve
[18:34:25] <robertmaxrees> but you can./
[18:34:31] <z1haze> but where will it come from
[18:34:34] <z1haze> if im not storing it
[18:34:39] <robertmaxrees> wait, i am passing it in.
[18:34:43] <robertmaxrees> myDeferred.resolve('foo');
[18:34:49] <z1haze> which comes from WHERE?
[18:34:54] <z1haze> it has to come from the constructor options, yeah?
[18:35:02] <z1haze> when i create the dialog instance
[18:35:07] <z1haze> its like this
[18:35:28] <z1haze> const d = new Dialog({ html: $('.som-div').html() }) d.open()
[18:35:42] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm missing something here then.
[18:35:42] <z1haze> or const d = new Dialog({ url: myUrl }) d.open()
[18:36:13] <robertmaxrees> so you have a default template and an ajaxed template?
[18:36:21] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/ec853a9475ab
[18:36:30] <z1haze> no, I have a empty div
[18:36:34] <z1haze> that gets populated
[18:36:42] <z1haze> either from html that its given
[18:36:44] <z1haze> or by a url
[18:37:38] <robertmaxrees> so something like https://bpaste.net/show/0c57ec510631 instead?
[18:37:44] <robertmaxrees> or whatever that default is.
[18:37:55] <z1haze> sure, exactly
[18:37:59] <robertmaxrees> "default" meaning the one passed in via the options on init.
[18:38:06] <z1haze> which means that i do in fact have to store the html when the object is created
[18:38:09] <robertmaxrees> just makes the API far more consistent to have it always resolve with the data you want.
[18:38:15] <z1haze> and since im doing that, It would be weird not to keep it up todate
[18:38:25] <robertmaxrees> i disagree, but okie :)
[18:38:51] <z1haze> I totally get where you are coming from though. I dont generally like this way either, (not using the data from the promise)
[18:38:52] <robertmaxrees> i guess I'm missing a bit in here about why you'd flip between ajaxed and non ajaxed ones.
[18:38:55] <z1haze> but for me this makes sense
[18:39:07] <z1haze> i had an example i was getting for you
[18:39:26] <z1haze> https://bpaste.net/show/ee63a80a4fc5
[18:39:27] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) it's all good.
[18:39:49] <z1haze> i didnt design the whole, which dialogs are ajax, which are static
[18:40:01] <z1haze> all I'm doing is writing this wrapper and providing my implementation to match the old st uff
[18:40:04] <robertmaxrees> i guess it feels like you're solving for a case that wouldn't happen though.
[18:40:12] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm confused.
[18:40:20] <z1haze> case of ever needing to know this.options.html
[18:40:22] <z1haze> ?
[18:40:28] <z1haze> if so, i dont disagree
[18:40:40] <z1haze> i agree that I technically dont need to know it
[18:41:04] <z1haze> but being that i take it in, in the constructor and it is in fact on the object, I should maintain it
[18:41:19] <robertmaxrees> i guess I disagree.  but it's all good :)
[18:41:24] <robertmaxrees> whatever fits your codebase.
[18:41:37] <z1haze> haha, yeah i suppose so
[19:26:15] <jak2020> how to set a value on a select/option and set all select control readonly, yes i know i can set: $("#mySelect").val('5');  but readonly? $("#mySelect").prop( "disabled", true );          <--- but i know if hide and/or disable...... when submit, the submit not take values hidden or disabled...
