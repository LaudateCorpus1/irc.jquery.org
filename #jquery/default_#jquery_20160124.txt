[00:36:38] <i-nik> Hi,I,m new and I would like to contribute,can someone get me started?
[05:34:50] <Sourcey> Hello. Is it possible to perform functions on appended items? Like append -> then do a .click() on one of the appended items?

[07:22:19] <JD-Robbs> I am using jQuery draggable's alsoResize option to resize a group of elements. Now, I would like to link into an event that is called on each "alsoResizable" element's "resize" event. Is there any way of achieving that?
[08:01:02] <JD-Robbs> Or, alternatively, I'd like to know how I can get jQuery to properly set left/top on autoResized elements. Currently, it only sets width/height which looks bad when resizing from the left-side handles. :)
[08:27:51] <JD-Robbs> Right, I guess this is impossible since "alsoResize" doesn't raise events on the other elements. :(
[08:33:25] <AlexRussia> Since there all js programmers, I have strange question. Does it safe to use `let` keyword in quersion of portability my js code?
[08:33:45] <AlexRussia> I just a bit unsure how old this feathure is
[08:34:58] <shoky_> AlexRussia: http://caniuse.com/#feat=let
[08:35:55] <shoky_> (so no, unless you're using something like babel)
[08:39:26] <AlexRussia> shoky_: oh, thank you :) What is a babel?
[08:43:29] <shoky_> AlexRussia: https://babeljs.io/  lets you use newer features that aren't implemented everywhere yet, compiles to regular js
[08:44:48] <AlexRussia> shoky_: it's just like in the jokes that new version of language compiler|interpreter writing in previous version of language? :D
[08:45:03] <AlexRussia> shoky_: okay, thanks for explanation!
[10:54:51] <Nanor> If I append HTML into an element, how can I view the updated HTML? source just shows the original?
[10:55:52] <shoky> Nanor: inspect the element in your browser's devtools.  right click -> inspect element.  or F12 to open devtools
[10:56:38] <Nanor> shoky, cheers
[14:32:02] <Bilel_mk> Hey everyone I hope you are all well ! i am wonder if someone can help why wen i put a script ajax and a script jQuery in the same page . js the Script Ajax does not work  http://pastebin.com/jpCPecEp

[14:42:18] <Bilel_mk> arc_, still not working ! http://pastebin.com/EaQsE0rf the script ajax does not work
[14:52:41] <Bilel_mk> Hey everyone I hope you are all well ! i am wonder if someone can help why wen i put a script ajax and a script jQuery in the same page . js the Script Ajax does not work   http://pastebin.com/EaQsE0rf
[15:39:18] <Duvdevan> so, if I want to find an element in a parent element, should I do:
[15:39:49] <Duvdevan> $(selector).parent().find(subselector).each(function() { do_something(); });
[15:39:53] <Duvdevan> or
[15:39:58] <Duvdevan> $(selector).parent().closest(subselector).each(function() { do_something(); });
[15:40:02] <Duvdevan> ?
[15:40:28] <rcyr> .closest(theParentSelector).find(subSelector)
[15:40:42] <rcyr> The usage of .parent creates fragile code.
[15:40:44] <Duvdevan> without the parent() method involved?
[15:41:17] <Duvdevan> so how do I CSS-ly define a parent if I have like:
[15:41:20] <rcyr> Duvdevan: .closest() iterates through the parentss
[15:41:54] <Duvdevan> <div class="parent"><div class="child"><button></button></div></div> <div class="parent"><div class="child"><button></button></div></div> <div class="parent"><div class="child"><button></button></div></div>
[15:42:10] <Duvdevan> and on any button click... how to I find the appopriate .parent class?
[15:42:24] <shoky> you've just been told
[15:43:19] <Duvdevan> if I say .closest('.parent')... it will fetch the closest ... not all .parent's in the document?
[15:43:27] <shoky> why would it fetch all?
[15:43:32] <shoky> $('.parent')  is for fetching all
[15:43:54] <shoky> it would do what the docs say it does - go read them ;p
[15:44:50] <Duvdevan> I am shoky matok... now I get it :D
[15:45:04] <Duvdevan> I'll save lots of lines in all my future projects :D
[15:46:04] <shoky> yessir
[16:55:20] <_TWG_> Is there a way with geolocation that I can say if your within so many mile's show a particular phone number & email address?
[20:21:32] <qud> what does using $.get on a webpage mean?
[20:51:37] <pmercado> when I do a selection, $('element')    and return an array of objects, they are in order?  I mean... $('ul li') return as appear rendered in browser?
[21:48:53] <_TWG_> Can someone tell my why my html is not changing.  I can't figure out why it's not.  The href is switching just fine.  http://kopy.io/NqncJ#n83rpROgabN9zb
[21:53:04] <arc_> span is not a sibling of anchor, it's a child
[21:53:29] <arc_> _TWG_
[21:53:35] <_TWG_> AGH, thanks.
[21:54:24] <_TWG_> Can I chain them like that?
[21:54:34] <arc_> it works, so yes. i've never seen that myself
[21:55:18] <arc_> you may run into some problems if you do that without fully understanding what is happening
[21:55:19] <arc_> in other situations
[21:55:35] <arc_> so ... although it works now, if you don't know exactly why it works, i would recommend not doing it
[21:55:57] <_TWG_> Okay.  I broke them apart but the html is still not changing after I changed siblings to child.
[21:56:06] <arc_> it's children, not child
[21:56:35] <_TWG_> Ahh.  Thanks arc_
[21:56:41] <_TWG_> It's all working now.
[21:56:49] <arc_> it will only be singular if there is only one possible result, like parent()
[21:57:04] <arc_> since an element can have multiple children, it's children()
[21:57:29] <_TWG_> Awesome.  Thanks for the additional info.  Still learning jquery.
[21:57:49] <arc_> me too ;)
[21:58:49] <_TWG_> I've always put it off but I've started finding reasons to learn.
[22:00:20] <arc_> it's helpful to be able to just put together some functionality really quick
[22:00:28] <arc_> or pull some data from a page
[22:00:39] <arc_> or customize a page to your liking with a userscript
[22:02:20] <_TWG_> Yeah.  I had to start learning last week due to my primary job.  We purchased a hosted calendar solution and the only way they let you modify the header/footer to resemble your website is via javascript/jquery.  That was a fun introduction.
[22:05:13] <arc_> heh
