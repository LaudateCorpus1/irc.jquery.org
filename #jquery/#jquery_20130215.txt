[00:00:01] <Cork> if a script tag has a src it will ignore the content
[00:00:12] <Cork> they need to be separate script tags
[00:00:37] <baptistem> damn
[00:00:49] <baptistem> ok, it's fixed now, thanks Cork :)
[00:00:56] <Cork> yw
[00:08:02] <Cork> hmm interesting...
[00:08:10] <Cork> didn't think proxy was THAT slow... http://jsperf.com/jquery-proxy-vs-scope
[00:13:55] <systemfault> I wouldn't be surprised if it uses .apply under the hood.. that's probably why it's slow.
[00:18:53] <nardev> hey guys, i need to select divs with id="itemXX" where XX is some number to distinguish divs. how do i do it?
[00:19:33] <gotwig> can I use PHP for some Javascript attribute stuff?
[00:20:00] <gotwig> how can I use PHP to embed between a attribute definition, that I am giving to a javascript function?
[00:20:05] <systemfault> nardev: div[id^="item"]
[00:20:50] <gotwig> my code is like http://paste.ubuntu.com/1656205/
[00:20:52] <gotwig> please help
[00:20:59] <nardev> systemfault, i LOVE jquery sooo powerful :D
[00:21:43] <systemfault> :)
[00:23:01] <gotwig> good for you, valentin ;)
[00:30:41] <nesoi> so I have a listview of contact names. and the user can click on a name and select or deselct it. This all works fine so far. But how I want to display a chooser which lets them pick one of perhaps several phone numbers the user may have, if they have more than one.
[00:31:27] <nesoi> what would be the right way to do that? user touches a listview row, they go to a screen that lets them pick a phone #, or it could be a popup... then they go back to the list they were on
[00:33:28] <nesoi> if I define a new page as the popup, I don't know how to get context back to where it was b4 the popup
[00:39:20] <nardev> systemfault, how do i actually get and id of div that was clicked? i know how to manipulate it with $(this) but i need id too for query
[00:39:46] <systemfault> $(this).attr('id') ?
[00:40:19] <nathanbz> you need to attach a click event handler to the div ?
[00:41:50] <nesoi> nathanbz : that's what I did, but I'm a novice
[00:42:09] <nesoi> $( document ).delegate("#message-page", "pageinit", function() { $('#recipientsList').on('tap', '.ui-btn', function(e){
[00:42:21] <nesoi> var tid = this.id;
[00:42:22] <nesoi> etc
[00:45:02] <starryeyed> hey all, good morning
[00:45:10] <starryeyed> is there a light weight version of yeoman?
[00:45:35] <starryeyed> I don't want it to do anything but just watch some files, and refresh the urls I specify
[00:45:47] <starryeyed> not a build tool, a watch tool
[00:49:18] <nathanbz> well if you are in the click event handler
[00:49:27] <nathanbz> you do what systemfault said to get the id
[00:49:40] <nathanbz> but why would you want the id when you already have the object
[00:49:44] <nesoi> actually what I posted works nathanbz
[00:49:45] <nathanbz> you can just use $(this).
[00:50:07] <nesoi> I wanted the value of id="value"
[00:50:30] <nathanbz> this.id should work ?
[00:50:38] <nesoi> it does
[00:50:42] <nathanbz> why bother putting it into a variable ?
[00:50:52] <nesoi> because of what I do with it next
[00:50:57] <nesoi> :)
[00:51:00] <nathanbz> whats that ?
[00:51:05] <nathanbz> why not just use this.id ?
[00:51:09] <nesoi> id = tid.substr(2);
[00:51:10] <nathanbz> and save some memory
[00:51:27] <nesoi> sorry tid = tid.substr(2);
[00:51:30] <nathanbz> id = this.id.substr(2) ?
[00:51:41] <nesoi> no difference, and really a couple of bytes?
[00:51:45] <nesoi> nowadays?
[00:52:04] <nathanbz> it's nitpik :)
[00:52:26] <nathanbz> but it can matter if inside a loop or something
[00:52:34] <nesoi> it's not in a loop
[00:52:48] <nesoi> tid goes in the loop
[00:53:05] <nesoi> I guarantee tid will be faster than this.id.substr(2) in a loop
[00:54:40] <nesoi> so what's the best way to do a popup or go to a new page, let a user do whatever, and come back to the same context as if it had been a function call with return variables?
[00:55:31] <nathanbz> history.back() ?
[00:57:04] <nesoi> will that go back to the same point in a scrolled listview?
[00:58:34] <nesoi> I want to do something like calling alert() but with more options and data, then return from the call
[01:02:46] <twoface1> Hi. In jQuery 1.8 .scrollParent() would return body if no other parents could be used, but $(body).scrollTop(100) did not work in IE. I then upgraded to jQuery 1.9, and .scrollParent() now returns 'html' - but this does not work in Chrome. Any ideas on a simple fix?
[01:11:55] <Cork> twoface1: i think window should work in both
[01:12:07] <granden> Anyone know of a nice jquery plugin to easily implement html5 video in the background of a website? And have it position fixed as well as filling the complete window? Dont care if it has to upscale it so the end parts of the video is not shown.
[01:12:21] <twoface1> Cork, but when trying to find scrollParent() dynamically, i can't use that
[01:12:41] <Cork> twoface1: you would have to check if scrollParent is html i guess
[01:12:49] <Cork> and if it is use window
[01:12:55] <twoface1> i was afraid of that :)
[01:13:57] <Cork> twoface1: an option might be to file an issue to have scrollParent choose the document window instead of the document window element
[01:16:24] <Cork> twoface1: btw i found this a bit interesting http://blog.methvin.com/2013/02/tragedy-of-webkit-commons.html
[01:16:34] <Cork> a little bit related to your question :)
[01:16:43] <Ganjaaa> how can i get the the text beween 2 div tags if i use ajax callback on a get request? can i grab it like data.find('#page').html() or it doent work cause its just a string?
[01:16:56] <twoface1> Cork, thanks - i'll look into it :)
[01:17:11] <Cork> twoface1: its not really any help, its just interesting
[01:17:39] <Cork> Ganjaaa: $(data).find('#page').html()
[01:18:00] <Cork> though if you parse the data stream you prob don't want the html from it
[01:18:04] <Ganjaaa> @cark : thanks ill try it :)
[01:18:14] <Ganjaaa> *Cork
[01:18:30] <Cork> as if you already have parsed it to dom, just add the dom to the page
[01:22:38] <Ganjaaa> @Cork : thanks its working
[01:25:11] <lejocelyn> hi
[01:25:25] <lejocelyn> I've got a simple new jquery user's question
[01:25:31] <lejocelyn> is it ok to do this :
[01:25:33] <lejocelyn>  $("<ul>", $items).append($clone).focus();
[01:25:35] <lejocelyn> ?
[01:25:48] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure how variables are handled by jquery
[01:25:51] <lejocelyn> a doc on it ?
[01:25:54] <Cork> $("<ul>", $items) makes no sense
[01:26:05] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[01:26:46] <Cork> and what is $items and $clone?
[01:27:11] <lejocelyn> Cork: to add an li, the clone, to this ul that I select by the class, $items
[01:27:20] <lejocelyn>  $items is a class
[01:27:26] <lejocelyn>  $clone is an li
[01:27:30] <Cork> so $items is a string?
[01:27:45] <lejocelyn> yes
[01:27:59] <Cork> where does "<ul>" come into the picture?
[01:28:36] <Cork> from what you said $($items).append($clone) sounds like what you want
[01:28:45] <Cork> *want
[01:29:16] <lejocelyn>  <div class="thme"//=$items> <ul> <li> </li> </ul>
[01:30:10] <Cork> huh?
[01:30:25] <Cork> <div class="thme"//=$items> is not valid html
[01:30:36] <lejocelyn> I know
[01:30:54] <Cork> so you can't select on it
[01:31:02] <Cork> the dom won't contain that, it will be error corrected
[01:31:09] <lejocelyn>  $items = 'theme'
[01:31:28] <Cork> $('.' + $items).append($clone)
[01:31:30] <lejocelyn> that was just a comment to say to what $items correponds to
[01:31:47] <lejocelyn> but I don't want to append to $items
[01:32:03] <Cork> you want to append to the ul inside it?
[01:32:04] <lejocelyn> I want to append to the <ul> inside '.' + $items
[01:32:15] <lejocelyn> yes
[01:32:18] <Cork> $('.' + $items + ' ul').append($clone)
[01:32:24] <lejocelyn> ahhh
[01:32:27] <lejocelyn> thanks
[01:32:31] <Cork> or $('.' + $items).find('ul').append($clone)
[01:32:36] <Cork> if you prefer that
[01:32:54] <Cork> (the first one is normally the better choice)
[01:33:15] <lejocelyn> as for the reading easyness ?
[01:33:43] <Cork> speed
[01:33:51] <lejocelyn> thanks you
[01:34:01] <Cork> '.theme ul' will just make one native javascrit call
[01:34:17] <Cork> document.selectorAll('.theme ul')
[01:34:34] <lejocelyn> true
[01:37:38] <tdskate> hi
[01:37:59] <tdskate> what's the easiest way to sync text in an input element with another element on the page?
[01:38:45] <Cork> tdskate: reacting to keyboards event and update the other element
[01:38:54] <Cork> sadly thats quite a bit harder then it sounds
[01:39:45] <tdskate> Cork: thanks, i'll figure it out :)
[01:44:18] <nardev> i added <scritp> tag somewhere in the middle of html and when i try to "alert" or console.log something, i get executed it twice.
[01:44:38] <nardev> SOME-TEXT-HERE 540:124        SOME-TEXT-HERE (program):16
[01:45:06] <nardev> in console i see first one is located in 540. line of html and second one is
[01:45:08] <nardev> strange to me
[01:45:42] <nardev> since i don't know why does that appear and what is that (program):16
[01:50:41] <Afflicto> Hello everyone. I'm doing a $.post() but php says $_POST is empty. Here's my function call to $.post:
[01:50:44] <Afflicto> ~
[01:50:56] <Afflicto> damnit, here: http://pastebin.com/MFBPm0C1
[02:00:56] <Ganjaaa> can someone tell me why this code wont work?      $.ajax({ url: href, success: function(msg){ $("#page").html($(msg).find("#page").html());} });
[02:03:34] <nardev> Ganjaaa, what was intention with tvice "#page"
[02:03:38] <nardev> *twice
[02:04:27] <Ganjaaa> nardev : i want a content replace on click
[02:04:32] <josefrichter> I'm looking for a library for this kind of as-you-type validation, please. not necessarily jquery. http://cl.ly/image/171l2H2p3n2g
[02:05:00] <nardev> Ganjaaa, did you try to erase it first?
[02:05:38] <Ganjaaa> nardev,  jea on a other funktion and it work
[02:06:25] <Ganjaaa> nardev,  the href link is also correct but he stuck at these point
[02:06:46] <nardev> i have no clue...
[02:07:24] <Ganjaaa> no problem :)
[02:18:29] <maxmoore14> anyone know the about the new _on method for widget factory?
[02:18:55] <maxmoore14> it maintains 'this' as the widget which is nice
[02:19:14] <maxmoore14> but how do I get the item that the event happened on?
[02:20:21] <shomon> hi, I have a button in the middle of a form that just calls some ajax stuff.. how can I make 2 fields on the form required before that button can be pressed?
[02:20:40] <shomon> this isn't the form submit button.. just a random little one :)
[02:24:37] <maxmoore14> shomon: handle the click event and manually validate
[02:26:15] <shomon> sorry, no idea what that means. I'm quite new to jquery
[02:26:58] <shomon> manually validate - do you mean I somehow via jquery grab on to the click event and attach some functionality that gets executed before it goes through?
[02:27:26] <keirlav87> whats your problem shomon?
[02:27:41] <shomon> as in if click -> check if field 1 and 2 are filled - > allow click or not based on this...
[02:28:05] <shomon> I'm trying to find out how to get jquery to check if a field is filled in before letting abutton get pushed
[02:29:28] <shomon> but I'm very much a beginner with jquery.. is there some good documentation to read to do this?
[02:30:40] <tdskate> is there a faster way to change values on a page instead of using .change() ?
[02:31:03] <Cork> tdskate: from an input field?
[02:31:17] <tdskate> Cork: yep
[02:31:30] <Cork> keypress or keyup
[02:31:45] <tdskate> key up, great !
[02:31:46] <tdskate> thx
[02:32:02] <Cork> keyup will trigger after a series of the same key is inputted
[02:32:10] <Cork> keypress will be for each new value in the input
[02:32:48] <tdskate> dammit query is awesome :)
[02:32:59] <tdskate> probably don't need to tell you guys
[02:33:00] <Cork> uh, thats not jquery, its just native dom
[02:33:11] <tdskate> oh
[02:33:12] <tdskate> http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[02:33:13] <tdskate> ok
[02:33:31] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/keyup
[02:33:40] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/keypress
[02:34:24] <Cork> i personally yearn for the day when input is supported by all browsers
[02:34:30] <Cork> THAT day will be SWEET
[02:34:45] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/input
[02:35:10] <keirlav87> shomon: have a look at this example, you should be able to follow what is going on and apply it to your own problem i hope - http://jsfiddle.net/ueGa9/1/
[02:35:25] <shomon> thanks!
[02:35:51] <shomon> that's exactly it!
[02:36:23] <shomon> however I do want to find out more about jquery.. it feels like arcane magic
[02:36:50] <shomon> ah just saw the doc in the /topic :)
[02:37:11] <shomon> oh.. intro to jsfiddle...
[02:37:44] <Afflicto> It seems i need to add site.com/index.php in my $.post call, otherwise the $_POST is regarded as EMPTY by php. Why?
[02:38:19] <Cork> Afflicto: might be you have a rewrite rule that doens't forward post variables
[02:38:23] <Cork> or something like that
[02:39:26] <maxmoore14> this is an easy one I think, I'm just missing something... http://jsfiddle.net/XdB3q/
[02:39:42] <keirlav87> no worries. it does do when your absolutely starting out, but read the docs and ask for help and it will start falling into place :)
[02:40:59] <Cork> maxani: this.element might be the target element; at least if it follows jquery standard form
[02:41:21] <Cork> alternatively you can use event.target
[02:41:27] <dtrott> I have a form with two submit buttons with different names I am registering a JQuery submit handler (on the form), inside that handler how do I know which of the submit buttons has been clicked ?
[02:41:45] <Cork> dtrott: you don't
[02:41:49] <Cork> sadly to say...
[02:42:09] <Cork> simplest is to add a hidden column and update its value when the buttons are clicked
[02:42:33] <dtrott> Wow really ? just to confirm I know when the request hits the backend because there is an extra control submitted , there is no way to check this on the front end?
[02:42:37] <Cork> don't forget to set it to autocomplete="off" so it doesn't keep the old value if the user hits f5
[02:43:05] <Cork> dtrott: not cross browsers from the submit event
[02:43:14] <Cork> you can in gecko, but not in the other browsers
[02:43:18] <dtrott> Okay thanks
[02:43:57] <maxmoore14> Cork: I can certainly make it work using old-style event handlers
[02:44:17] <maxmoore14> just trying to use the 1.9 widget factory so I'm good for the future
[02:44:24] <keirlav87> maxmoore use event.target i think to get the clicked element
[02:44:54] <tomo> When will be the JQM 1.3 release? Next Mon?
[02:45:37] <maxmoore14> keirlav87: duh! that makes sense
[02:45:38] <maxmoore14> thanks
[02:46:16] <keirlav87> actually reading up cork already said that :p
[02:47:58] <maxmoore14> yep, thx to both
[03:39:55] <pallet> morning all
[03:40:25] <mikecmpbll> i'm using sortable from jquery UI, and I'm trying to implement a kind
[03:40:27] <mikecmpbll> oops
[03:41:23] <mikecmpbll> i'm using sortable from jquery UI to allow the user to order some cells by dragging. I'd like to be able to detect if a cell was dropped over a certain div in order to be able to implement a kind of "bin" functionality that removes that cell
[03:41:39] <mikecmpbll> any pointers?
[03:44:55] <mikecmpbll> ooh, droppable. nvm
[03:47:42] <pallet> can anyone help me with this.... http://www.jtable.org/ApiReference#genopt-addRecordButton
[03:49:54] <josefrichter> stupid question: a method returns me a jquery object like this http://d.pr/i/OFLA how do I access it's properties, e.g. the errorList? I thought it's foo.errorList, but no...
[03:54:27] <josefrichter> please…. I'm stuck on that...
[03:55:48] <pallet> anyone please
[04:06:20] <Cork> josefrichter: .prop
[04:06:36] <josefrichter> Cork ?
[04:06:54] <Cork> "how do I access it's properties"
[04:07:10] <Cork> its jqObject.prop('propertyName')
[04:07:45] <Cork> pallet: you need to ask a question too, not just link to a documentation page
[04:09:38] <josefrichter> Cork it returns me $.validator object but $.validator.prop('errorList') returns no method error
[04:10:02] <Cork> wait $.validator isn't a dom element
[04:10:42] <josefrichter> Cork no. it's some kind of object I don't know and not sure how to handle it.
[04:10:58] <Cork> $.validator is just a plain object
[04:11:15] <Cork> if it exposes value its as a straight .<name>
[04:11:29] <pixolin> Hi, I have a – slightly off topic – question. If I inspect a website with some jQuery animation (e.g. http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/basic.html) in Chrome Developer Tools the source code changes with each new slide which makes it somewhat hard to read the source code. How would I switch that off/stop the jQuery-animation (perhaps even a certain animation only)?
[04:12:17] <Cork> pixolin: that the code changes isn't something you can turn off
[04:12:18] <pixolin> sorry I'm asking here, but I thought people who work more frequently with jQuery should know.
[04:12:23] <Cork> as that actually happens
[04:12:25] <pixolin> you can't?
[04:12:31] <Cork> but you can turn of highlighting it
[04:12:45] <Cork> no cause the inspector shows the state of the dom
[04:12:48] <Cork> and as it changes
[04:12:49] <pixolin> but can I stop a running JavaScript (in Chrome Dev Tools)?
[04:13:10] <Cork> you would frees the entire webpage
[04:13:19] <Cork> but ya, just hit breakpoint in the code
[04:13:27] <pixolin> where would I do that?
[04:14:27] <Cork> just hit the pause button
[04:14:44] <keirlav87> I have a html string returned from the server, how can I retrieve a link from that string ?
[04:15:09] <pixolin> sorry, I must be blind … a pause button? perhaps I'm just missing that?
[04:15:26] <Cork> keirlav87: either you have to parse the entire html string and select on the link; or you have to use regex
[04:15:41] <pixolin> oh, sources > right pane > pause button, that one?
[04:15:47] <keirlav87> ah regex, my old nemesis, we meet again
[04:15:49] <Cork> yes
[04:16:08] <Cork> keirlav87: but the most robust one might actually be to parse the string and do a dom selection
[04:16:28] <Cork> $(html).find('a.class-name').attr('href')
[04:17:12] <keirlav87> you can search html strings in that way? I had no idea thank you
[04:17:41] <Cork> keirlav87: you don't search html
[04:17:54] <Cork> you parse it into dom, then do a pure dom selection
[04:17:57] <pixolin> cool, got what I was always looking for, thanks Cork!
[04:18:05] <Cork> np
[04:19:44] <keirlav87> I tend to use semantically null english when i describe the way jQuery works, sorry :p
[04:20:53] <josefrichter> Cork $.validator.errorList returns undefined, even thought it's defined. jsbin here http://jsbin.com/ulomid/1/edit any ideas please?
[04:24:07] <pallet> Sorry guys, I'm back again, I should have asked a question, http://www.jtable.org/ApiReference#genopt-addRecordButton basically, I don't understand what the manual is telling me
[04:24:08] <Cork> man i hate jsbin...
[04:24:16] <Cork> it crashes high and low for me
[04:25:22] <Cork> pallet: you could set that to a jquery wrapped dom element
[04:27:09] <pallet> Cork, I'm a newbie, can I PM for a moment?
[04:27:32] <Cork> pallet: sorry, i'm at work and i don't have time for private support
[04:27:41] <pallet> sure, ok man
[04:29:31] <pallet> so, for example, I've got <button id="add_record">Add New Record</button> how would I add it ?
[04:30:47] <mazzachre> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/NaARz/4/ I am wondering, what would be the best way to add width to the individual elements in order to make them fill out the ul to both sides?
[04:32:45] <josefrichter> Cork anything similar to jsbin that doesn't crash for you? :-)
[04:33:06] <Cork> josefrichter: there is, but its slow in stead :/
[04:33:08] <Cork> jsfiddle
[04:34:02] <Cork> i need to run in a bit higher security, so the dependencies that jsbin has doens't work
[04:35:32] <josefrichter> Cork ah right. so how about this please http://jsfiddle.net/josefrichter/9Uced/
[04:35:53] <josefrichter> Cork I must be doing some really stupid mistake
[04:38:13] <Ganjaaa> damn ive got a problem .... i added a $('a').click event to change my content via jquery .. but after change all new links/a-tags doent have the click event ... how can i redeclare the event?
[04:38:14] <Cork> josefrichter: http://jsfiddle.net/9Uced/1/
[04:38:22] <Cork> the list is empty, but it is defined
[04:38:52] <josefrichter> Cork but when I look at the object in console, the list is not empty. and it shall not be empty...
[04:41:01] <Cork> josefrichter: http://fiddle.jshell.net/9Uced/3/show/
[04:41:14] <Cork> [Object { message="Please enter at least 6 characters.",  element=input#pass.error}]
[04:41:18] <Cork> so, wfm
[04:43:24] <Ganjaaa> kk ive got it .live command ^^
[04:43:38] <Cork> Ganjaaa: no
[04:43:43] <Cork> .live is deprecated
[04:43:49] <Cork> use .on or .delegate
[04:44:00] <Ganjaaa> ok w8 i try it
[04:44:10] <Cork> they use a different syntax though
[04:45:35] <Cork> Ganjaaa: http://api.jquery.com/live/#entry-longdesc
[04:46:27] <josefrichter> Cork that one returns me empty array in console :-o
[04:46:45] <Cork> josefrichter: not if you add values to the pass field
[04:48:11] <Ganjaaa> Cork: ty but .on doent work for me i try .delegate now
[04:48:24] <Cork> Ganjaaa: did you use the correct syntax?
[04:49:05] <Ganjaaa>  $("a").on('click',function(event){ .....
[04:49:19] <Cork> thats not a delegated on listener
[04:49:40] <Cork> $('a').live('click, func) === $(document).on('click', 'a', func)
[04:49:54] <Cork> and $(document).delegate('a', 'click', func)
[04:50:21] <Ganjaaa> ahh ok i understand
[04:52:12] <Ganjaaa> Cork: working :) tyyy ... is it better to use always on if i declare events?
[04:52:42] <josefrichter> Cork FFFFUUU it now works in jsfiddle but not in my code :-( thanks though
[04:52:50] <chase-work> i have some jquery that sets overflow-y to visible on a div in the td element, but setting height to auto doesn't seem to expand the height of the element. any suggestions?
[04:58:40] <seutje> chase-work: isn't visible the default for overflow?
[04:59:46] <serdem> is there any library that index large JSON object for quick search?
[05:02:23] <chase-work> yes it is
[05:03:00] <chase-work> by default i'm setting it to hidden, because there is a little icon to expand the td to see all the contents, because there can be a *lot*
[05:04:14] <seutje> tables do weird shit
[05:04:56] <chase-work> yea its annoying
[05:05:13] <chase-work> it seems you have to modify table, tr, and td to all be 100%
[05:06:39] <josefrichter> Cork crazy. the very same link http://fiddle.jshell.net/9Uced/3/show/ now returns empty array again. what kind of voodoo is this?
[05:08:24] <xnotte> $("#setas").css('background-position','0px -1400px'); anyone can tell me what i'm doing wrong ? if i do this, doesnt happen nothing. But if i set it in CSS background-position: 0 -1400px; it works
[05:12:29] <shcked> xnotte: could you make a fiddle for your issue please
[05:16:20] <josefrichter> Cork sorry does it still work for you? not sure what's wrong here
[05:16:59] <mazzachre> I have a problem... http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/NaARz/7/ 10 pixels pr. element seem to leave somewhere... No idea where!!
[05:18:54] <sw99> Why does slideToggle also adjust the padding of my element?
[05:19:03] <sw99> I want it to side the height ONLY
[05:19:09] <sw99> but it's actually animating the padding too
[05:20:35] <seutje> sw99: guess they implemented that to avoid the jump-issue
[05:20:56] <seutje> where it would animate the height down to 0 and then the padding would remain, jumping when it goes all display:none
[05:21:31] <sw99> oh
[05:22:13] <sw99> what options do i have then? this behavior looks unnatural because the text "moves". i want the text to be "fixed" during the animation
[05:22:18] <serdem> 7
[05:23:03] <serdem> whoops
[05:23:26] <seutje> mazzachre: what is this suppose to do, it looks as if you're deliberately making then 10 px shorter than they should be o.O
[05:23:33] <josefrichter> ok, anyone else, any ideas why I'm getting empty array here? http://jsbin.com/ulomid/2/edit
[05:24:03] <seutje> sw99: implement ur own stepper function or use a wrapper element
[05:25:37] <mazzachre> seutje: It is supposed to increase the size of each element in order to make them fill out the available horizontal space in the table... Over mutliple lines...
[05:28:24] <seutje> mazzachre: so item three should span the entire line?
[05:28:55] <otherj> hey guys, how do i make dynamically added elements in a .sortable area also sortable? i tried .sortable('refresh') after my .append and it doesn't seem to make the new element sortable
[05:29:39] <mazzachre> seutje: Well, if there is not space for two items on the line, it should :) Basically it should just fill out the content to a block even though the individual items are of different sizes...
[05:34:02] <mazzachre> seutje: Does it make sense?
[05:34:38] <seutje> mazzachre: I guess, but that would take quite some logic
[05:45:15] <^Mike> How do I select elements that have this class but not that class?
[05:47:19] <seutje> $('.this-class').not('.that-class')
[05:48:05] <^Mike> oh, lovely
[05:48:09] <^Mike> thanks, seutje
[05:55:43] <sw99> seutje: thanks that worked
[05:55:48] <sw99> went with inner element
[05:55:54] <sw99> or, wrapper element
[06:01:28] <v0lZy> Hi
[06:01:32] <v0lZy> Can somone help me
[06:01:36] <v0lZy> Why is this not working?
[06:01:38] <v0lZy> var QuickTileClass = ".QuickTile" ;
[06:01:40] <v0lZy> 		    var QuickTileClassUnderlay = QuickTileClass + "Underlay" ;
[06:01:41] <v0lZy> 		
[06:01:43] <v0lZy> 			$(QuickTileClass).mouseover(function(){ $(this).stop(true); $(this).children(QuickTileUnderlayClass).stop(true); $(this).children(QuickTileUnderlayClass).animate({opacity: '0'},'fast'); });
[06:02:31] <v0lZy> Im having trouble with the
[06:02:48] <brantje> can you post a jsfiddle?
[06:02:52] <v0lZy> .children(QuickTileUnderlayClass).stop() and .animate()
[06:03:47] <v0lZy> brantje: I have 2 classes... .QuickTile and .QuickTileUnderlay (which is a child of .QuickTile if you look at the DOM structure
[06:03:54] <v0lZy> But I want to be able to change these names on the fly
[06:04:18] <brantje> addClass and removeClass?
[06:04:19] <mazzachre> seutje: Ya, that is what I figure... So I am just leaving it as is currently, then they can request that visual if they really want it...
[06:04:25] <v0lZy> so .... right now its called QuickTile and QuickTileUnderlay... later on, the elements might be PreviewTile and PreviewTileUnderlay
[06:04:27] <v0lZy> or
[06:04:34] <v0lZy> AAAA and AAAAUnderlay
[06:04:36] <v0lZy> etc.
[06:04:51] <brantje> use $(this)
[06:04:54] <v0lZy> Now $(QuickTileClass) references '.QuickTile'
[06:05:12] <brantje> this and childeren
[06:05:16] <v0lZy> But .childre(QuickTileUnderlayClass) doesnt reference .QuickTileUnderlay
[06:05:23] <brantje> api.jquery.com/children/
[06:05:46] <seutje> mazzachre: it's sorta like masonry, but different dimension, and if u look at the logic it takes to make that fit...
[06:06:03] <v0lZy> cant i use a variable inside .children() ?
[06:06:13] <seutje> granted, it uses absolute positioning instead of regular flow and re-orders if shit fits better that way, but still, it'll be a large chunk of logic afaict
[06:06:18] <v0lZy> or is this an issue of there being function
[06:06:28] <v0lZy> and QuickTileUnderlayClass being defined outside of it?
[06:06:38] <v0lZy> (i declared with var)
[06:06:43] <seutje> prolly scoping issue, yea
[06:07:17] <seutje> or maybe they're not direct children
[06:07:22] <seutje> really hard to know without more coads
[06:08:50] <v0lZy> but if i use var
[06:08:59] <v0lZy> isnt it supposed to be global?
[06:11:08] <v0lZy> Oh
[06:11:12] <v0lZy> stupid stupis tupid me...
[06:11:26] <v0lZy> QuickTileClassUnderlay vs. QuickTileUnderlayClass
[06:11:28] <v0lZy> doh :D
[06:11:35] <v0lZy> sorry guys, figured it out, thanks
[06:24:07] <Ganjaaa> if i load my content via ajax how can i redeclare the cycle plugin?
[06:26:34] <v0lZy> hm
[06:26:37] <v0lZy> another question
[06:27:00] <keirlav87> Ganjaaa do it in the success callback of your ajax request
[06:27:12] <v0lZy> can i pass the animate value pair (like top: '235px') as a single variable? like AnimatePositon ?
[06:27:37] <v0lZy> var AnimatePosition = 'top: 235px'  ;
[06:27:52] <v0lZy> but i think it should be ... "top '235px'" for animate...
[06:27:56] <Ganjaaa> ok ty i try it
[06:34:58] <Ganjaaa> it works thanks :) ... these room save my day :3
[06:36:26] <saltcod> Anyone know about switch statements?  Can I use logic in a case?
[06:36:28] <saltcod> http://cl.ly/image/3D0N0W0p1P3J
[06:36:44] <saltcod> Doesnt seem to work for me
[06:38:27] <saltcod> If anyone would benefit from the jsbin:  http://jsbin.com/uzigop/2
[06:38:28] <tom[]> is there a plugin that extends $.ajax with features to assist in monitoring/logging ajax service prformance on teh client side?
[06:38:28] <pachet> saltcod: use if/else
[06:39:13] <saltcod> pachet: too bad.  I was hoping to employ the switch
[06:39:28] <DeltaHeavy> tom[]: Why not just use Chrome dev tools?
[06:40:00] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how I can drop all the indexes in an array after a specific index? For example if I have an array with indexes 0-55, I could drop indexes 22-55?
[06:40:48] <tom[]> DeltaHeavy: i mean for monitoring the performance that actual users experience
[06:41:53] <DeltaHeavy> tom[]: The only way to do that is to do it for yourself then :p All computers can really do is crunch numbers.
[06:42:32] <tom[]> DeltaHeavy: i would have thought i'm not the first to try to add performance monitoring to $.ajax
[06:42:51] <DeltaHeavy> tom[]: If you want to monitor the performance look at Chrome dev tools :p
[06:43:03] <DeltaHeavy> Everything you can monitor is there.
[06:43:12] <DeltaHeavy> Regarding XHR
[06:44:46] <tom[]> DeltaHeavy: if a given client reports problems and i cannot repeat them or find any clues in server logs, chrome doesn't help me debug the problem
[06:45:12] <DeltaHeavy> tom[]: What kind of problem?
[06:45:54] <gotwig> gday
[06:45:56] <DeltaHeavy> Idk what else you can really monitor regarding making an AJAX request that Chrome dev tools doesn't have.
[06:47:03] <tom[]> for example: user reports that the service "doesn't work". i suspect excessive latency. missing responses. maybe caused by a network problem at or near their end.
[06:47:59] <tom[]> DeltaHeavy: i could add monitoring in my software that submits reports back to the server on the next page load, but i imagined somebody has already done that part in a plugin
[06:48:13] <tom[]> DeltaHeavy: or part of it
[06:49:06] <seutje> DeltaHeavy: I didn't know u made websites
[06:49:31] <DeltaHeavy> tom[]: JS can only work with the current page. If you load a new page it won't submit unless you make an AJAX request to the server before page load, but you'd have to run .preventDefault() on that element before hand. Regardless the only way you could report an AJAX issue to a server, is with AJAX...soooo that's probably your problem.
[06:49:54] <DeltaHeavy> Kinda impossible.
[06:50:29] <tom[]> DeltaHeavy: ok
[06:50:32] <DeltaHeavy> seutje: That I do
[07:07:16] <navetz> Hi, I am trying to load a tooltip on dynamically loading content using jqueryui, is that possible and am I approaching it the right way? This is what i've got but it's not working http://jsfiddle.net/P9D8P/
[07:13:41] <Cork> navetz: content should be a function that does the ajax call
[07:13:50] <Cork> navetz: http://api.jqueryui.com/tooltip/#option-content
[07:15:05] <navetz> Cork: The selector is dynamically loaded through ajax, will the tooltip still work if the selector doesn't exist when the page is initialized?
[07:15:19] <Cork> navetz: check the doc
[07:15:28] <Cork> "Function: A callback which can either return the content directly, or call the first argument, passing in the content, e.g., for Ajax content."
[07:16:34] <Cork> content: function(content) { $.ajax().done(function(data) { content(data); }); }
[07:17:24] <navetz> Cork: The problem is not loading ajax content into the tooltip, I can't seem to get the tooltip to work on my selector which is loaded dynamically
[07:18:30] <hXm> hello to everybody i will ask a question in the next line
[07:18:48] <pachet> not if i get there first!
[07:18:58] <hXm> damn, i'll try later
[07:19:29] <Jaredcheeda> I'm trying to get an section of an Accordion to open based on the url. like so https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1050916/temp/accordtest.htm#print  but I can't get it to work with the first section (#test), and if no section is specifed in the url it defaults to showing the last section instead of the first. can I get some help on this
[07:20:12] <hXm> i have a database with a table of many data, i want to display a list of objects, in same way as the explorer windows show the folders and files
[07:20:24] <hXm> able to select them with mouse and so on
[07:20:26] <hXm> is that possible?
[07:22:14] <hXm> did i explain it right?
[07:22:32] <hXm> an example of this is this http://f.cl.ly/items/03333k3G2T0D3k1P372Z/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202013-02-15%20a%20la(s)%2016.21.59.png
[07:22:38] <Jaredcheeda> yeah I just think there's not a lot of people here right now to help
[07:22:45] <hXm> ah
[07:22:54] <hXm> is 4pm here but may be 4am there
[07:23:36] <Jaredcheeda> 10:23 am for me!
[07:24:59] <hXm> does it have a name
[07:25:05] <hXm> gridlistview or something like that?
[07:25:41] <Jaredcheeda> http://jqueryui.com/selectable/#display-grid
[07:25:45] <Jaredcheeda> maybe something like that
[07:26:22] <hXm> closer, is selectable with clicks not with mouse movement
[07:26:26] <hXm> but thats the concept! thanks
[07:26:31] <hXm> i can google now
[07:26:39] <Jaredcheeda> you can click and drag with it
[07:26:42] <Jaredcheeda> try more harder
[07:27:05] <Jaredcheeda> just need to start from inside one fo the boxes
[07:27:13] <Jaredcheeda> can also CTRL+CLICK
[07:27:41] <hXm> may be this trackpad doesnt works so well
[07:27:49] <hXm> im taking a look, thanks

[07:41:52] <nFFF> Guys when doing css('width') how can I get 30% instead of 100ppx?
[07:43:06] <Gho5t> so you set the div's width to 100px?
[07:43:19] <Gho5t> and you want it to tell you what percentage it takes up of its parent?
[07:43:53] <Ov3rTaf> x=p.width*30/100
[07:45:41] <ogk1000> any ideas why this simple code is not working? please see line 7 http://collabedit.com/atswj
[07:47:49] <ogk1000> lol cute
[08:08:10] <pallet> Me again
[08:08:39] <pallet> $("#myDiv").load("http://u2me.co/3s~e");  If I just create a div called myDiv that should work, shouldn't it?
[08:10:35] <BillCriswell> pallet: It has to be the same domain.
[08:10:59] <pallet> f**k
[08:11:02] <pallet> thought so
[08:12:13] <BillCriswell> pallet: If you can run php or something you can get around it pretty easily, like... .load('/get_remote_page.php?url=http://www.google.com');
[08:13:12] <BillCriswell> get_remove_page.php would just echo file_get_contents($_GET['url']);... or course you should sanitize properly and everything else.
[08:16:27] <scalex000> hi, I need some help
[08:16:28] <pallet> BillCriswell, that sounds like a better idea I was about to go down the ifram road
[08:16:45] <scalex000> which editor use here?
[08:17:31] <pallet> the /get_remote_page.php? what's that file actually doing?
[08:18:46] <BillCriswell> pallet: It's just echoing the contents of a remote site.
[08:19:10] <BillCriswell> An iframe may be a better approach.
[08:19:33] <pallet> I own both domains
[08:20:26] <BillCriswell> If you really want the whole site somewhere on your page you should probably just use an iframe.
[08:21:47] <pallet> BillCriswell, iFrames arent flexible in height though are they?
[08:22:49] <pachet> ?
[08:23:53] <BillCriswell> pallet: You mean to dynamically set the height?
[08:24:11] <pallet> yeh
[08:24:19] <pachet> if they're on the same domain you can have the iframe tell the parent what it's height is
[08:24:27] <pachet> and have the parent resize accordingly
[08:24:30] <pachet> it's a hack and a half
[08:24:38] <pachet> but then again, you are using iframes
[08:24:40] <pallet> pachet, it's not the same domain,
[08:24:59] <pachet> sol
[08:25:00] <pallet> although I might make it become the same
[08:25:07] <BillCriswell> pallet: Eh, maybe the php script is the best bet.
[08:25:15] <pallet> yeh
[08:25:18] <pachet> there's the html5 iframe message api, but
[08:25:21] <pachet> :[
[08:25:37] <Jaredcheeda> I gotta go, but if anyone can take a look at this and PM any ideas, that would be awesome, https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1050916/temp/accordtest.htm#print
[08:25:53] <BillCriswell> If you don't set a height on the iframe is it just 0px?
[08:25:58] <BillCriswell> Research party.
[08:26:00] <moura> is there any solution for cross browser image preview before upload?
[08:26:48] <pallet> basically I want to stick http://u2me.co/3s~e into a DIV, well onto a page of some sort
[08:27:34] <pachet> BillCriswell: no, there are browser defaults
[08:27:59] <pachet> moura: not truly cross browser without flash
[08:28:19] <BillCriswell> pachet: It would seem to much more logical to make it the height and width of its contents.
[08:29:15] <moura> without flash the only solution i see is a ajax for uploading the img 2 the server bah
[08:29:44] <pachet> and even that's not supported in ie<9
[08:32:50] <scalex000> how can I do a command after post end?
[08:45:31] <pachet> scalex000: you mean $.post?
[08:45:59] <scalex000> let me paste the code
[08:46:01] <EdwardIII> hey, when you create a clickable jQuery ui button i.e. ... buttons { 'Click Me!': function(){ do some stuff...
[08:46:35] <EdwardIII> is there a way to get that button? jQuery UI doesn't seem to pass the button in, or give you any way of tagging it with a unique class or ID?
[08:48:05] <scalex000> pachet, look http://pastebin.com/R82NdVhK
[08:50:35] <scalex000> I have if the post have data get the html
[08:51:30] <inTheBackSeat> i have a design which must flow a strict tab sequence and as it horizontal scrolls cannot tab outside the visible window. to accomplish this i used javascript to add a tabindex=-1 to all elements in the affected section onliad and then i enable the indexes as the page becomes visible. it appears to be good. no performace issues. as a sanity chaeck is this approach reasonable or am i inviting trouble.
[08:51:44] <zoned> what code can i use to wait until a <video> element has loaded?
[08:52:14] <masentinel900> Hello everybody!!
[08:52:20] <masentinel900> I have a little question!
[08:52:56] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/dGPvD/
[08:54:23] <masentinel900> That is my script. the problem is that I need  to get the value of a <li> tag wich is above one level
[08:58:36] <Tcalp> hey all
[08:58:57] <theCatIsPurring> masentinel900 where is the hrml and at what point do you need to access the li?
[08:59:07] <theCatIsPurring> *html
[09:00:40] <lethjakman> hey, I was wondering if anyone had a link that explained how jqueries $('.class #id') selectors work. I dont' even know where I'd start looking in the code
[09:00:56] <lethjakman> I want to do similar things in vanilla javascript
[09:01:40] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/dGPvD/1/
[09:01:47] <masentinel900> That is my html view
[09:04:14] <shoky> masentinel900: you can use $(this).closest('li')
[09:06:11] <theCatIsPurring> masentinel900 you shoudl first ensure the nested items are correctly nested
[09:06:22] <theCatIsPurring> masentinel900 the html you provided is a mess
[09:06:35] <awc737> anyone know if Zurb has an irc #
[09:07:22] <theCatIsPurring> masentinel900 after your ducks are all in their rows you can iterate the lists in a few ways.
[09:10:19] <theCatIsPurring> masentinel900 your html is ok if the trailing li is part of something which we cannot see
[09:25:59] <bendman> are there any good, basic file tree viewing plugins out there that are active?  I found one here, and an associated git repo, but they both seem pretty dead http://www.abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/
[09:27:48] <bendman> most I find are part of big libraries like ext.js and are a bit overkill.  It seems like a simple JSON-to-filetree thing should exist.  If not… I'll create one and put it up, provided my boss is feeling open source friendly today

[11:08:08] <abstortedminds> what function should i use to search the DOM for a specific text value inside a div tag?
[11:08:53] <johnkpaul> ?:contains @abstortedminds
[11:08:54] <bot-t> abstortedminds, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:09:05] <abstortedminds> thanks
[11:12:26] <masentinel900> Hello guys
[11:12:39] <brbcoding> hello
[11:12:55] <masentinel900> Is there a better way to put this var   :::   var dataInfo = {Count : $(this).attr('id')};
[11:13:23] <abstortedminds> johnkpaul, is there something i can do with contains to get the exact match instead of all the contain that text?
[11:13:39] <abstortedminds> like is() or something
[11:13:47] <djQuery> don't know if I am using the indexdb plugin wrong or if I am doing .done wrong http://jsbin.com/igihih/2/edit
[11:13:48] <abstortedminds> instead of just all items that contain that text
[11:13:49] <johnkpaul> abstortedminds: I don't understand your question
[11:13:55] <johnkpaul> I thought that's what you were looking for
[11:14:04] <johnkpaul> you wanted all divs that contain that text
[11:14:05] <djQuery> the .done never seems to fire
[11:14:23] <masentinel900> Is that when I going to put dataInfo. just show me Count and prototype like options..
[11:14:25] <abstortedminds> i get multiple items back, i want the exact match
[11:14:33] <masentinel900> I need to put the options closets.
[11:14:43] <abstortedminds> <title>node100001016</title>
[11:14:43] <abstortedminds> <title>nodestart:p2->node100001016</title>
[11:14:51] <abstortedminds> see the both contain the text i want
[11:14:57] <abstortedminds> i want the exact matched one
[11:15:09] <abstortedminds> just the node100001016
[11:15:16] <Gho5t> then check text()
[11:16:44] <djQuery> $('title').filter(function(elem){ if ($(this).text() !== 'my value'){ return; } else {return this;}}})
[11:16:57] <djQuery> abstortedminds, ^^^^
[11:17:02] <abstortedminds> ok lemme try that
[11:17:03] <abstortedminds> thx
[11:17:17] <djQuery> abstortedminds, see `filter
[11:17:43] <djQuery> `filter@abstortedminds
[11:18:01] <djQuery> abstortedminds, see ?filter
[11:18:01] <bot-t> abstortedminds, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[11:18:11] <abstortedminds> very cool!
[11:18:12] <abstortedminds> ok
[11:18:47] <djQuery> don't know if I am using the indexedDB plugin wrong or if I am doing .done wrong http://jsbin.com/igihih/2/edit    the done never gets called when saving
[11:19:36] <masentinel900> Someone could help me?
[11:20:13] <djQuery> masentinel900, looks good to me is it not working?
[11:20:39] <masentinel900> Is working perfect..
[11:20:39] <djQuery> masentinel900, I am using that same basic syntax in the code here don't know if I am using the indexdb plugin wrong or if I am doing .done wrong http://jsbin.com/igihih/2/edit
[11:21:50] <djQuery> var $li = $li = $(this).closest('li'), data = {id: $li.data('id'),v: $li.find('.v').val(),c: $li.find('.c').val()};
[11:22:02] <djQuery> masentinel900, ^^^^
[11:22:27] <masentinel900> do you speak spanish
[11:28:11] <abstortedminds> djQuery, i have no idea why this isnt working, it doesnt find anything:  $('title').filter(function(elem){ if ($(this).text() !== 'node100001016'){ console.log('not found'); } else {console.log('found');}})
[11:28:42] <abstortedminds> this is the item: <g id="node2" class="node"><title>node100001016</title>
[11:29:09] <djQuery> abstortedminds, all I can say is review the .filter docs I havent looked at them in a while.
[11:29:16] <abstortedminds> ok checking again
[11:29:20] <djQuery> abstortedminds, see ?.filter
[11:29:30] <djQuery> ?filter
[11:31:21] <djQuery> abstortedminds, .filter(function(elm){ return ($(this).text() === 'my value'); })
[11:31:32] <abstortedminds> ah
[11:31:47] <djQuery> abstortedminds, you are just supposed to return a true false
[11:33:02] <djQuery> you would think that irc servers would have bots built into them that could only be controled by channel operators
[11:33:03] <chase-work> i could have sworn before I was able to do $('#elem').css('background-color', '#fff').animate({'background-color' : '#000'}, 1000); but now the animation never occurs…
[11:34:23] <djQuery> chase-work, are u using jquery ui? I think animating colors requires see ?ui.color
[11:34:26] <bot-t1> chase-work, UI/Effects/animate - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI effects core extends the animate function to be able to animate colors as well. It's heavily used by the class transition feature and it's able to color animate the following properties: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/animate
[11:34:50] <chase-work> djQuery: yes i'm using jquery ui
[11:34:51] <sunuslee> hi, can i set toolbar's item size? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html  i want to have two items, one is 1/4 size, the other is 3/4
[11:35:24] <chase-work> I've also already read the wiki page
[11:35:54] <chase-work> it's why i'm confused the animation or even change of color doesn't occur
[11:36:44] <chase-work> i suspect a conflict is occurring somewhere
[11:38:00] <mikehaas763> I'm on a different domain. I setup CORS on the server. I can succesfully send credentials with $.ajax and I get a response back that appears good and says it say the .ASPXAUTH cookie and all that. In javascript on the successful return I then do window.location to the other domain I authenticated against. However, it wants me to login still. Why won't this work?
[11:38:00] <chase-work> hmm… looks like i'm random getting a 'undefined' is not a function in (evaluating 'a.charCodeAt(a.length-1)'
[11:38:32] <masentinel900> anyone have seen my line?
[11:38:40] <masentinel900> I need help please!!
[11:42:06] <sunuslee> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html can i change size of the ONE/TWO items ? i want one take 3/4 and two take 1/4
[11:49:32] <chase-work> djQuery: i was using an old version of jquery-ui which was conflicting with dataTables.js
[11:49:34] <chase-work> fixed
[11:49:35] <chase-work> thanks
[12:02:49] <rideh> anyone used: https://github.com/Gild/bootstrap-tour ? having an issue where generated html is being displayed in the popover's instead of rendered. Any ideas what's up?
[12:04:08] <sm`> l
[12:08:17] <booom> dudes
[12:08:33] <booom> i load html file
[12:08:45] <booom> i would like to take only div #my-div from the html
[12:08:48] <booom> how to do?
[12:09:08] <gotwig> do you know the spotify web player?
[12:09:09] <booom> $().load('file.html#my-div'); is this right?
[12:09:19] <eddiemonge> rideh: if your site requires a tour, your ui probably needs work
[12:09:20] <gotwig> When you log in, it feels like the whole thing blurs you in
[12:09:25] <gotwig> you get into that..
[12:09:30] <gotwig> I want to have that effect as well
[12:09:37] <eddiemonge> booom: you need a space before #my-div
[12:10:02] <rideh> gotwig: target userbase is very …. simple....
[12:10:06] <gotwig> I load many different objects, and I only want that users see them when they're ready. And when they're ready I want a blur in
[12:10:14] <booom> @eddiemonge space?
[12:10:27] <rideh> oops, eddiemonge ^ what i said to gotwig
[12:10:28] <booom> file.html space #my-div ?
[12:10:44] <eddiemonge> space as in      space
[12:11:08] <booom>  ok
[12:11:42] <eddiemonge> booom: $("#placetoinsert").load('file.html #my-div')
[12:11:52] <booom> oh yeah so thanks!
[12:12:01] <eddiemonge> although it might be better to change your server's response so it just returns #my-div instead of the whole page
[12:12:54] <gotwig> http://www.ajaxload.info/
[12:12:57] <gotwig> that website is awesome
[12:13:13] <Mage_Dude> Anyone have tips on cloning and element and then removing it when done? I've got a table with a hidden delete form which I clone, change the target for 'yes' and then destroy the cloned copy. I'm not sure how to verify that the clone is gone.
[12:14:21] <sunuslee> hi, can i set toolbar's item size? http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0-rc.1/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html  i want to have two items, one is 1/4 size, the other is 3/4
[12:16:39] <eddiemonge> Mage_Dude: .remove() works pretty well
[12:17:29] <Mage_Dude> eddiemonge: I tried that but the object reference seems to still be there (with a basic console.log), I'm sure it's my lack of understanding of memory management and garbage collection.
[12:24:09] <gotwig> how can I see if a function is sucessfull, and untill that execute another one..._
[12:24:11] <gotwig> ?
[12:24:19] <gotwig> make a callback?
[12:29:25] <eddiemonge> Mage_Dude: code?
[12:29:31] <eddiemonge> gotwig: or a promise
[12:29:32] <chilversc> gotwig: I'm guessing its an asynchronous function then?
[12:30:06] <gotwig> hm
[12:30:11] <gotwig> Actually it is PHP
[12:30:14] <gotwig> so I better should ask there
[12:30:15] <gotwig> sry
[12:30:23] <gotwig> some database stuff
[12:30:37] <chilversc> which has made me wonder, is it possible for an asynchronous ajax call to ever complete synchronously?
[12:30:56] <chilversc> or does the ajax api always ensure it will complete asynchronously?
[12:31:11] <Gho5t> wat
[12:31:46] <chilversc> well if you have; $.get('someurl', b); a(); can you ever see it execute; b(); a();
[12:32:04] <chilversc> ie, the get completes synchronously and thus immediatly calls the callback
[12:32:22] <Gho5t> you know that ajax is by definition, asynchronous, right
[12:32:27] <chilversc> rather than the standard asynchronous callback, which would always execute; a(); b();
[12:32:32] <scalex000> hello I need some help to what I need to do first
[12:32:40] <scalex000> anyone give a hand
[12:32:52] <chilversc> Gho5t: yeah, but say .net has async/await keywords that are used with Tasks, similar to a promise
[12:33:08] <chilversc> Gho5t: but a .net Task can complete synchronously, even if its async
[12:33:19] <Gho5t> I have no idea about that
[12:33:24] <chilversc> one example might be if the computer knows it has no connection, it can error right away, no async needed
[12:33:28] <Gho5t> I'm just telling you that ajax is always async
[12:33:37] <Gho5t> it's making a separate request
[12:33:42] <chilversc> right, but is that an implementation detail, or actually part of the spec
[12:34:25] <Gho5t> so you're asking if there's a flag you can set
[12:34:31] <Gho5t> to make it synchronous?
[12:34:33] <Gho5t> answer is no
[12:34:45] <Gho5t> use a deferred or the callback
[12:35:12] <chilversc> Gho5t: no, more does the spec guaruntee it will always execute as; a(); b(); and there will never be a case where the implementation can complete synchronously instead, thus executing as b(); a();
[12:36:12] <Gho5t> doubtful
[12:36:48] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/hSEAeKz5
[12:37:03] <rideh> can i trigger delay immediately after selector?
[12:38:20] <chilversc> Gho5t: yeah, I've just never considered it before, but in .net that is perfectly legal, you're supposed to immediatly check "did execute synchronously" flag
[12:38:50] <BillCriswell> rideh: You mean like... var $foo = $('.foo'); setTimeout(function(){ $foo.addClass('waited-5-seconds'); }, 5000); ?
[12:39:26] <rideh> BillCriswell:  morelike $('.foo').delay(4000).doSomething()
[12:40:01] <BillCriswell> There is a delay() but I think it only works after animation thingies.
[12:40:04] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[12:41:58] <BillCriswell> rideh: What I gave you will do what you want, though.
[12:42:17] <rideh> BillCriswell:  yeah just about to test it, thanks
[12:45:15] <rideh> BillCriswell:  delay works just fine but still doesnt resolve the issue of another script binding to elements that are generated. i thought it was triggering between the dom drew the elements but thats simply not the case.
[12:45:23] <rideh> BillCriswell: sorry setTimeout()
[12:45:28] <scalex000> Gho5t, I have a complicate problem I dont know how call this http://pastebin.com/hSEAeKz5
[12:48:53] <BillCriswell> rideh: Are you setting a delay to wait for some ajax content to load?
[12:49:17] <rideh> BillCriswell: attempting to
[12:49:41] <BillCriswell> rideh: You would have to use the success callback.
[12:50:17] <BillCriswell> Also, if you want events to be attached to newly added elements you probably want to use .on()
[12:51:16] <BillCriswell> $('.i-hold-dynamically-generated-content').on('click', '.i-am-dynamically-generated', function(){ // YEAHHHHHHH });
[12:51:42] <BillCriswell> The second way would mean you don't need to worry about the success callback.
[12:54:35] <chilversc> odd, as much as I know that ajax requests always complete asynchronously, nothing in the spec seems to indicate that has to be the case
[12:57:42] <chilversc> I suppose its implicit due to step 9.4 of send(), where control returns from the send() method, and since javascript is single threaded in the browser the events from the request can't be raised until the current method finishes (even if it can complete synchronously) thus they have to be queued
[12:57:45] <mikehaas763> when I have <form name='form'> how can I select with jquery?
[12:57:53] <mikehaas763> or do I need a class or id?
[12:58:21] <Seich> you can $("form[name=form]")
[12:58:23] <chilversc> mikehaas763: I'd go with an id for simplicity, but you can select it with $('form[name="form"])
[12:58:45] <chilversc> mikehaas763: or just $(document.getElementsByName("form")) if that method exists
[12:59:27] <chilversc> mikehaas763: though getElementsByName would be the equivilent to $('*[name=form]')
[12:59:58] <booom> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgfFoZ8tq5w
[13:00:37] <booom> LOL
[13:02:17] <rideh> BillCriswell: with either success or complete it doesn't fire my fucntion
[13:02:36] <rideh> BillCriswell: i should say the first fucntion that fires on success works but a second one chained with .success does not
[13:02:49] <eddiemonge> rideh: whats the problem? code?
[13:03:04] <joel> Am I retarded, or? I'm having trouble finding a link to download a minified jquery-ui?
[13:03:57] <rideh> eddiemonge:  http://pastebin.com/q1Ju4XSH
[13:04:01] <eddiemonge> joel: you should really build your own jqui
[13:04:14] <joel> eddiemonge: what do you mean?
[13:04:29] <rideh> eddiemonge: never makes it to #22
[13:04:50] <eddiemonge> joel: go to jqueryui.com and click custom download
[13:05:07] <joel> eddiemonge: how neat, a page I can't wget.
[13:05:23] <tomasm-> hi, is there a plugin that lets me rotate pictures in browsers? I've tried the standard transform: rotate(90deg), etc... but I don't expect it to rotate around the center axis - I'd rather see the "new" top left be where the old "top left" is...
[13:05:25] <scalex000> hello, I dont how to show this daata
[13:05:26] <scalex000> http://pastebin.com/hSEAeKz5
[13:05:33] <rideh> eddiemonge: and yeah i know the rest of that code is absolute garbage but its a hack on a hack on a hack and i've not had time to refactor
[13:06:18] <eddiemonge> joel: what are you trying to do?
[13:07:07] <joel> wget jquery-ui onto a machine, pref. a minified production ready to go
[13:07:15] <joel> doesn't seem like it exists without doing asshatery
[13:08:02] <eddiemonge> joel: for a webserver? http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.10.0/jquery-ui.min.js but i still recommend building a custom version
[13:08:04] <rideh> eddiemonge: actually i tkae it back, looks like it does work but its just putting text at bottom of page, its not seeing the proper library now
[13:09:23] <scalex000> what I need to do, get the framework and then post the data or against
[13:10:01] <dteric> basic js question, could someone explain this syntax
[13:10:09] <dteric> var $window = $(window),
[13:10:09] <dteric>       flexslider;
[13:10:16] <tomasm-> anybody ever deal with image/div rotation using jquery?
[13:10:18] <dteric> the comma is throwing me
[13:10:24] <tomasm-> especially items that were NOT square
[13:12:13] <eddiemonge> dteric: var x, z, y; same syntax
[13:12:58] <NoiseEee> dteric: someone is defining two variable. the first '$window' is assigned to $(window), the second 'flexslider' is just declared / not assigned
[13:13:52] <aboveaverage> ello people
[13:14:21] <aboveaverage> I could use some help with a really simple jquery ui thing
[13:17:56] <bendman> aboveaverage: what is this simple thing you speak of?
[13:18:19] <aboveaverage> I found some code on stack overflow to do what I want, but there's two issues
[13:18:45] <aboveaverage> I want to link to a page with an accordion and have the link open a specific part of the accordion
[13:18:49] <aboveaverage> like so, http://www.housingservices.com/dev/Dropbox/chs2012/siteroot/accordtest.htm#print
[13:18:59] <aboveaverage> and it works, except for two bugs
[13:19:44] <aboveaverage> if you leave off the #NAME from the end and don't specify a section for it to open, it opens the bottom one by default, where as I want it to open the top one by default
[13:20:04] <aboveaverage> and if you type in the top on, in this case #test, it just closes all of them
[13:21:18] <dteric> NoiseEee Thank you
[13:21:37] <djQuery> hmmmm    var x = $('.something');    somemore code;     x.remove()
[13:21:46] <djQuery> will this not remove the item from the dom?
[13:23:09] <djQuery> aboveaverage, I believe that accordion only allows 1 open at a time
[13:23:19] <aboveaverage> that's what I want
[13:23:33] <aboveaverage> I just want to specify which one on page load based on the url
[13:23:46] <djQuery> aboveaverage, as for which one is open initialy if no #name was specified in the url
[13:23:56] <djQuery> I believe that is one of the options for it
[13:24:02] <djQuery> ?accordion
[13:25:01] <aboveaverage> how do I set it so if the url doesn't specify which one to open, it opens the first one and not the last one
[13:25:10] <djQuery> $('#accordion').accordion({active: 2})    for example would open the 2nd one
[13:25:44] <djQuery> actualy it would open th e3rd since its 0 based
[13:26:01] <djQuery> aboveaverage, in ur case you want to pass it a 0 then
[13:26:43] <aboveaverage> how do I do that
[13:27:05] <topspin> Is there an alternative to docs.jquery.com...?  been down a loooong time now.
[13:27:27] <djQuery> aboveaverage, http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-active
[13:28:16] <djQuery> topspin, http://api.jquery.com/
[13:29:17] <djQuery> hmmmm    var x = $('.something');    somemore code;     x.remove()
[13:29:44] <scalex000> hello
[13:29:55] <CannabisToke> hi
[13:30:06] <topspin> does api.jquery.com include plugin docs?  the validation plugin documentation links heads right back to docs.jquery.com...
[13:30:59] <aboveaverage> looks like the first option is already active on page load, so if you choose it with #test then it will perform a "click" on it causing it to hide. don't know why the bottom one shows by default though
[13:31:17] <djQuery> topspin, no but just searching google for jquery validation usualy turns it up pretty quick
[13:31:19] <scalex000> aboveaverage, hi I need help
[13:31:48] <aboveaverage> whatcha got
[13:32:31] <topspin> ppl need to keep their servers up
[13:33:26] <scalex000> aboveaverage, I need to wait until I get data or not before show the table
[13:33:38] <scalex000> aboveaverage, what I need to use
[13:34:53] <djQuery> `callback@scalex000
[13:35:06] <djQuery> neith bot is running? geez
[13:35:17] <djQuery> scalex000, how are u getting the data?
[13:35:50] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[13:36:06] <scalex000> let me put the code
[13:36:11] <scalex000> djquery
[13:38:05] <scalex000> djquery, taka a look http://pastebin.com/TY9yfhKZ
[13:39:09] <djQuery> scalex000, so your using knockout.js?
[13:39:49] <djQuery> scalex000, there is a way in knockout.js to hide something if it has no data
[13:39:56] <scalex000> yes,
[13:40:17] <scalex000> Im using knockout
[13:40:18] <djQuery> scalex000, http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/visible-binding.html
[13:41:02] <topspin> well, docs.jquery.com appears to be the sole source for almost all plugin docs on earth... no mirrors anywhere.  api.jquery.com is has nothing on plugins.  wtf
[13:41:20] <djQuery> topspin, WTF man
[13:41:25] <topspin> wtf wft?
[13:41:25] <scalex000> djquery, I want to
[13:42:24] <djQuery> topspin, there is a documentation link on each plugin listed in the repository.
[13:43:10] <djQuery> topspin, so jquery should use thier bandwith whether it be server time network or people in maintaing these docs?
[13:43:30] <djQuery> its upto the plugin developer to find a host for it
[13:44:31] <zUriel_> While using a "menu", how do I find out what item was selected ? It seems that it's the whole menu by itself that is the target...
[13:45:13] <djQuery> zUriel_, http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#event-select
[13:47:15] <zUriel_> Yep, I was using that, but the item seems the menu itself, not the item. I'll check out thatmore precisely...
[13:47:43] <topspin> amateur nonsense
[13:51:03] <djQuery> can't figure out why my on is not firing    $ul.on('click', 'btnDelete', function(){   http://jsbin.com/igihih/2/edit
[13:51:37] <NoiseEee> djQuery: presumably you mean .btnDelete not btnDelete
[13:51:57] <djQuery> NoiseEee, lol yeah thanks
[13:56:08] <shader> is there a way to use something like .queue(), but where functions in the queue can insert more methods after themselves?
[13:56:48] <shader> basically, I'm trying to do a basic modular state machine in a dialog, where the next steps are dependent on the user's choices
[13:57:13] <shader> but I want some choices to have immediate next steps without erasing stored steps in the future
[13:57:39] <shader> just wondering if there's already a way to do that with jquery, or whether I have to write it myself
[13:59:12] <shader> ok, looks like I can use unshift for that
[13:59:17] <shader> thanks for listening :P
[14:00:15] <BillCriswell> shader: Haha
[14:00:39] <BillCriswell> or splice()
[14:00:54] <shader> true
[14:03:37] <Kambfhase> Is there a known bug with jQuery and .remove() endless recursions?
[14:05:22] <Kambfhase> I am trying to debug some code and it keeps crashing Chrome
[14:07:56] <djQuery> can't understand why I keep getting an error that db is not defined. http://jsbin.com/igihih/2/edit
[14:08:27] <djQuery> line 6 declares a global object of db
[14:10:57] <Kambfhase> djQuery: you declare db within a function.
[14:11:27] <Kambfhase> lexical scoping,
[14:11:32] <djQuery> Kambfhase, yes but notice that I do not put the reserved var infront of it
[14:11:36] <nesoi> so does anyone here use simpledialog2?
[14:11:54] <djQuery> if it were a scoping issue then I would have the same issue with the save button
[14:11:57] <Kambfhase> `var db = event.target.result;` ?
[14:11:58] <djQuery> it works fine
[14:12:23] <djQuery> Kambfhase, db = todosDB.result;
[14:12:27] <nesoi> also another question: if you have an event function, you can use 'this' in the function, but if you call another function from within that function you can no longer use 'this' context I think? is there a way to pass it?
[14:12:38] <djQuery> line 6
[14:13:09] <Kambfhase> nesoi: var self = this;
[14:13:27] <nesoi> and then function(self)?
[14:13:29] <gnarf> nesoi: funciton.call( this, argument, argument2 )
[14:13:32] <djQuery> indexedDB runs onupgrade then loads the db which causes the onsuccess to run
[14:13:36] <gnarf> that sets the "this" inside the call
[14:13:45] <gnarf> but you can also just pass the (this) as an argument
[14:13:52] <nesoi> thanks Kambfhase and gnarf
[14:13:57] <gnarf> `mdn function.call
[14:14:00] <b-ot> gnarf: Function.prototype.call - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[14:14:25] <nesoi> so no one uses simpledialog2? or is there a good alternative to that for popping up a dialog?
[14:14:39] <nesoi> basically I need a popup with 2 or more buttons
[14:14:56] <nesoi> (jquery mobile)
[14:15:46] <melkor> If I'm setting the value of a radio button automatically will that trigger an even. such as $(button).change(function(){}); ?
[14:15:58] <melkor> It does not trigger change.
[14:16:06] <Tcalp> Hey all, I was hoping someone could provide me with a bit of advice...
[14:16:37] <Tcalp> I am using the datepicker to display a date range selection : http://puu.sh/237kN
[14:17:07] <iksik> how can i get DOM element UNDER dragged element?
[14:17:09] <Tcalp> and am using the following code to init: http://puu.sh/237lO
[14:17:59] <andrew91841> and ?
[14:18:13] <Tcalp> but the active date in 'date from' does not seem to get set properly, in that the highlighted month should be a month prior on display / showing that it is the 15th of Jan that is active/selected
[14:18:19] <andrew91841> iksik: example ?
[14:18:33] <Tcalp> http://puu.sh/237oy .. is what is looks like on load
[14:18:55] <Tcalp> but the first box should be on Jan 15th .. or that's how I'd like it at least
[14:19:29] <andrew91841> maybe your php code isn't outputting it in the right format
[14:19:35] <andrew91841> and defaulting to Date.now()
[14:19:53] <Tcalp> outputted format is shown in the text boxes
[14:20:24] <andrew91841> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[14:20:28] <andrew91841> i believe it requires slashes
[14:21:43] <nesoi> so what do you guys do when you want to pop up a dialog box easily? This looks good but I'm not getting it to work well: http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos/bool.html
[14:21:44] <mikehaas763> data: $('#portalLogin').serialize() <- why does this line in an ajax call not produce any form data in the request? It's a POST ajax call
[14:22:14] <systemfault> mikehaas763: Have you tried console.log'ing it?
[14:22:15] <andrew91841> you can do it that way Tcalp, but youll  have to parse your date into a date object and then put that into setDate
[14:22:41] <andrew91841> mikehaas763: maybe you're not getting any data back ?
[14:22:50] <mikehaas763> hmm
[14:23:02] <mikehaas763> I'm gonna try outputting that call to console
[14:23:30] <nesoi> no one uses dialogs here?
[14:24:10] <andrew91841> nesoi: there are a handful of dialog libraries out there
[14:24:33] <nesoi> andrew91841 : yes, but any good ones? :)
[14:25:07] <andrew91841> they each have their own uses
[14:25:19] <mikehaas763> andrew91841 ya it's not printing anything. However, I definitely have a form with that id
[14:25:25] <andrew91841> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal
[14:25:30] <nesoi> andrew91841 : I'd like one that works... the one I linked works in one case, and I can't get it to work in another case
[14:26:03] <andrew91841> well you would need to provide a code sample for us to look at
[14:26:04] <nesoi> the problem with the normal jquery method is that each dialog is a page, so you can't easily pop one up and then get the return values when the user closes it
[14:26:24] <nesoi> andrew91841 : rather than trying to debug simpledialog2, I was hoping someone could recommend a diifferent method
[14:26:28] <nesoi> or library
[14:26:30] <andrew91841> each dialog is a page? i thought they're appended to the bottom of your page as a div
[14:27:09] <nesoi> andrew91841 : the way I was reading it, if you open a normal dialog in jqm it is as if you went to a new page
[14:27:20] <nesoi> and then when you close it, it's as if you went back to the other page
[14:27:31] <andrew91841> i think your understanding is flawed
[14:27:44] <mikehaas763> nvm, i'm an idiot I forgot the name="" on the inputs
[14:27:45] <nesoi> probably :)
[14:28:15] <andrew91841> hehe
[14:28:23] <andrew91841> name is more important than id's on inputs
[14:29:05] <iksik> andrew91841: example of drag&drop?
[14:29:11] <dblosevn> hey guys, quick question what would be the best way to delegate an event handler for all ui tab click events to change the url hash
[14:29:28] <nesoi> andrew91841:   what I want to do is something like dialog("test
[14:29:31] <nesoi> oops
[14:30:03] <nesoi> anyway what I want is a call which will pop up a dialog and then return values to me
[14:30:14] <dblosevn> i dynamically inject new ui tabs widgets so id like it to always have the event attached
[14:30:32] <nesoi> so I have a tap event, and want to decide whether to do something or pop up a dialog
[14:30:38] <dblosevn> there always children of #ajax-content thoguh
[14:30:43] <nesoi> if I pop up a dialog, I want to capture what button was pressed, and then do something else.
[14:30:55] <nesoi> so I don't want to transfer control to another page when the dialog comes up
[14:31:16] <andrew91841> nesoi: i could show you how but that would be no good.  you would want to read up on js before proceeding
[14:31:33] <dblosevn> nesoi: e.stopPropagtion();e.preventDefault(); then return false; at the bottom of your handler
[14:32:59] <Tcalp> used the example from the api doc .. http://puu.sh/237Q0 ...
[14:33:06] <Tcalp> that isn't working either .. heh
[14:33:06] <dblosevn> nesoi: or simply dont use a submit button, use a button instead eg <button type="button">OK</button>
[14:33:20] <iksik> andrew91841: http://jsfiddle.net/hPTB5/103/
[14:33:36] <nesoi> dblosevn : then I have to define tap events on each button in each popup, no?
[14:34:11] <nesoi> the code starts to look very messy
[14:34:15] <dblosevn> um ... $('#parentid button').on('click', function(e) { //dostuff });
[14:34:17] <djQuery> any more ideas on this? http://jsbin.com/igihih/2/edit   db is not defined
[14:34:25] <dblosevn> one handler
[14:34:50] <nesoi> dblosevn : one handler for each button in each popup, no?
[14:35:01] <nesoi> oh for all the buttons in any popup
[14:35:13] <dblosevn> or delegate it so you only ever have to bind once... $('#parentid').on('click', 'button', function(e) { //dostuff });
[14:35:18] <nesoi> but still, it seems really messy.
[14:35:23] <dblosevn> your crazy
[14:35:31] <dblosevn> learn js then talk to me lol
[14:35:59] <dblosevn> you only need one handler for all the buttons with the methods i just gave you
[14:36:39] <dblosevn> inside the callback you can do something like var clicked = $(this).attr('id'); if (clicked === 'but-ok')
[14:38:17] <andrew91841> djQuery: you should really do, var indexedDB = window.indexedDB || window.webkitIndexedDB || window.mozIndexedDB;
[14:38:20] <dblosevn> jsfiddle down?
[14:38:26] <andrew91841> nah jsfiddle is just slow
[14:38:35] <dblosevn> goin on 45 seconds
[14:38:42] <dblosevn> hasnt loaded yet
[14:38:56] <andrew91841> iksik: what are you trying to achieve
[14:39:32] <djQuery> andrew91841, the shim I have will take care of that
[14:40:29] <djQuery> dblosevn, jsbin is fast as always
[14:40:48] <dblosevn> ya i know, i like fiddles ui better though
[14:41:17] <iksik> andrew91841: i want to get 'handle' of the element under dragged element, during 'drag'
[14:41:33] <iksik> draggable target
[14:41:45] <iksik> tfu, droppable target *
[14:41:46] <iksik> ;]
[14:43:08] <djQuery> damn db thing was just a timing issue. its taking longer to open the db than for the rest of the code to run
[14:43:36] <monteith> if i have a div#primary with many div.videos inside of it, how do i get the index() of the one clicked in jqueyr 1.4.2?   $('#primary').index($(this)) ?
[14:43:47] <abstortedminds> when event listeners are instantiated, and the content of the page is reloaded through ajax, do those event listeners attach themselves to the new content ?
[14:44:04] <andrew91841> depends how you declare them
[14:44:11] <abstortedminds> $(function(){
[14:44:11] <abstortedminds>       $(".edge").toggle(
[14:44:14] <abstortedminds> is basically what i did
[14:44:32] <andrew91841> no, that code is executed immediately
[14:45:12] <abstortedminds> what should i google for ?
[14:45:39] <andrew91841> jquery.on
[14:45:43] <abstortedminds> ok thanks
[14:46:50] <nesoi> ok this is the actual problem I'm having: https://gist.github.com/rlad/0e37ca9e82d6b8dad40f
[14:46:50] <dblosevn> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/Xmvtz/ how many buttons do you see also how many handlers do you see?
[14:47:00] <nesoi> the top one works, the bottom one doesn't
[14:47:47] <dblosevn> all mine work lol
[14:47:48] <andrew91841> monteith: $(".videos").click(function() { alert($(this).index())});
[14:48:11] <nesoi> dblosevn : yes, thanks... in that code I pasted I'm using simpledialog2
[14:48:15] <monteith> it's returning -1
[14:48:20] <monteith> which makes 0 sense to me
[14:48:38] <dblosevn> nesoi: doesnt matter what your using, this can be applied to anything
[14:48:47] <andrew91841> monteith: jsfiddle it
[14:49:01] <dblosevn> maybe not using data params but that could easily be changed to use something else
[14:49:04] <monteith> www.sleepnumber.com/pillowfit
[14:49:12] <monteith> bottom video buttons
[14:49:17] <nesoi> dblosevn : right, thanks...
[14:49:35] <nesoi> this simpledialog2 thing seems nice though, except that I am not getting it to work in one of the 2 places I want to use it
[14:49:59] <monteith> andrew91841:  j$ is the jquery identifier
[14:50:03] <monteith> if you want to console it
[14:50:17] <monteith> sorry, but jsfiddle is blocked on our wonderful firewall.
[14:50:57] <nesoi> using jqm dialogs would be more complicated because I will have to update the text in them before launching them, etc.
[14:52:52] <dblosevn> nesoi: Using button ids: http://jsfiddle.net/Xmvtz/1/ Using the text on the button: http://jsfiddle.net/Xmvtz/2/
[14:53:06] <dblosevn> in both cases only one line of code changed
[14:53:28] <Tcalp> $50USD to someone who is experienced with datepicker UI who can solve my problems with my implementation
[14:53:38] <Tcalp> (paypal)
[14:53:41] <nesoi> dblosevn:  I'm referring to the contents of the popup, which will be different every time
[14:54:07] <dblosevn> nesoi: ok .... the contents fdont matter
[14:55:03] <dblosevn> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/Xmvtz/3/
[14:56:01] <melkor> how do I cancel a link, ie if somebody clicks but I don't want the page to leave.
[14:56:07] <nesoi> right, I know that. I'm talking about the fact that it seems like a lot of code to rewrite the contents of each popup each time, rather than calling something with some parameters, which is what I'm trying to do by using that simpledialog2
[14:58:32] <andrew91841> Tcalp, same problem ?
[15:00:21] <tdignan> Hey, when using jquery ui's sortable, what's the best way to keep track of the list item's movement? I'd need to get the offset of the list item in a callback so I can update the order in the database.
[15:00:34] <tdignan> I see "offset" in the UI object, but it seems to be the screen position offset.
[15:00:44] <tdignan> I'm looking for the offset it moved in relation to the other list elements.
[15:01:32] <tdignan> my first thought is that I need to tag each <li> with a number somehow, either by the ID, or by using a hidden child element.
[15:01:43] <tdignan> really, not sure what the best way is, though.
[15:02:14] <systemfault> tdignan: I would add a data-id="" to the <li>s
[15:02:24] <tdignan> =O
[15:02:27] <tdignan> that sounds perfect
[15:02:29] <shoky> Tcalp: you need to "setDate" using the same date-format that you set
[15:02:34] <tdignan> is that valid HTML systemfault?
[15:02:49] <tdignan> or is it just de-facto usage for this kind of thing
[15:02:54] <systemfault> tdignan: Valid HTML5… but works in HTML4
[15:02:59] <tdignan> sweet, i'm using html5.
[15:03:08] <tdignan> you have saved me much time and frustration
[15:03:10] <tdignan> thank you.
[15:03:14] <systemfault> tdignan: The attributes must start with data-
[15:03:21] <tdignan> ah, so I can do data-foo
[15:03:28] <tdignan> that is so awesome
[15:03:30] <tdignan> exactly what I wanted
[15:03:37] <systemfault> <li data-foo="foo" data-bar="bar"></li>
[15:04:16] <tdignan> that is so awesome
[15:04:22] <systemfault> Yep :)
[15:04:27] <shoky> Tcalp: do i get the $50 now
[15:05:33] <shoky> Tcalp: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7hM75/
[15:10:34] <Mage_Dude> Any good links/notes on creating nested DOM nodes? I've got an epic comprehension fail and can't seem to create a trio of <span> elements inside three nested <divs> with the appropriate classes attached.
[15:12:50] <nesoi> so this is odd... the popup dialog doesn't appear, but when I touch places on the screen, I get console logs as if I were touching buttons on the non-existent popup: https://gist.github.com/rlad/3435deb7076cafcc5945
[15:17:33] <kokoat> $('<div/>',{id:"content"}).html($html)
[15:17:36] <kokoat> is that wrong?
[15:20:38] <shoky> depends what's in $html
[15:22:13] <shoky> and what 'wrong' means to you
[15:29:31] <kokoat> if i can use that selector with html(), only seen it with load(). and it wasnt working but now it is
[15:31:33] <kokoat> So another question. I have a button inside a div. when i click that button, i want the button of said div to get replaced by the html in another div. I put this other html in a hidden div, but when i ido $('#conent').html($html)
[15:31:47] <kokoat> the hidden div that contains the $html gets shown. is this normal behavior/.'
[15:31:57] <Mage_Dude> If you know the structure in advance, is it better to just create a string of tags and modify what you need, or create each node programmatically and add classes/content as needed?
[15:33:31] <tlkr> kokoat, why don't you just do $('div').data('originalContent', $('div').html()).html($('otherdiv').html());
[15:35:27] <kokoat> because...let me look at that for a moment
[15:36:02] <black_warlock> hey guys
[15:36:35] <black_warlock> i have found nice script for drag and drop upload
[15:36:45] <CannabisToke> just curious, why won't a comma work here, I have more variables and this just seems odd, (ObjH - ObjImgH) / 2; versus (ObjH - ObjImgH) / 2,
[15:37:01] <black_warlock> but it doest finalize the upload why ?
[15:37:11] <black_warlock> the script is this one
[15:37:24] <black_warlock> and uses HTML5 apis
[15:37:28] <black_warlock> http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/filedrag/1/index.html
[15:37:56] <black_warlock> after the drag and drop it removes the "submit" button
[15:38:14] <black_warlock> and i dont understand how the files get uploaded
[15:38:38] <black_warlock> i have a server side function which perform the file upload
[15:39:04] <black_warlock> but these files arent in the form fields
[15:39:32] <kokoat> tlkr: i dont get that
[15:40:55] <black_warlock> nobody can help mem ?
[15:40:59] <black_warlock> =(
[15:46:50] <otherj> you should probably give it more than 4 minutes
[15:47:47] <lethjakman> hey, is there any easy way to include jquery permenantly in my browser?
[15:48:01] <lethjakman> I'd like to use it while typing into my javascript console
[15:48:29] <kokoat> theres a plugin
[15:48:41] <kokoat> firequery for firefox
[15:48:44] <kokoat> not sure about chrome
[15:52:54] <Mage_Dude> Why does console.log break a string up into each cahracter?
[15:54:28] <systemfault> Never seen it do that.
[15:55:02] <tlkr> kokoat, it stores the current inner html within the data of the div and then places the new html within it
[15:57:24] <chilversc> Mage_Dude: perhaps the value you've logged was split in to an array? so the console was just logging an array of characters
[15:58:41] <Mage_Dude> chilversc: It was just a 'thingy = new String("<long hairy bunch of DOM crap>"); console.log(thingy)' I went around it but it was weird.
[16:00:15] <kokoat> tlkr: won't work because there will be more than one button
[16:00:25] <kokoat> so if i have 3 buttons, each will grab html from a hidden div
[16:00:38] <tlkr> yes, so it will work?
[16:00:39] <yogurt_truck> Mage_Dude: don't use the String constructor
[16:00:42] <kokoat> unless i store it it in each button
[16:01:22] <chilversc> Mage_Dude: ah, it seems a string object isn't exactly the same as a string primative https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
[16:01:31] <tlkr> store the html within the divs not the buttons
[16:01:41] <chilversc> Mage_Dude: so maybe the console sees it as type object, but sees the length property thus assumes its an array
[16:01:46] <tlkr> or within the buttons
[16:01:47] <tlkr> up to you
[16:02:36] <chilversc> and that also explains the ''+foo stuff I see to convert to strings
[16:02:52] <chilversc> it isn't just saving characters, it also gives a primative string rather than a string object
[16:10:22] <dblosevn> chilversc: ive never seen ''+foo in javascript
[16:10:30] <dblosevn> ive seen it in java however
[16:10:51] <chilversc> dblosevn: hmm, I've seen it as the output from minifiers
[16:10:53] <dblosevn> its a requirement really in java
[16:12:01] <Mage_Dude> When using $(document).on('click', '.selectorClass', function () { //stuff }) isn't that now the equivalent of the old .live()?
[16:12:39] <yogurt_truck> Mage_Dude: pretty much
[16:12:48] <dblosevn> Mage_Dude: yes that is but it does exactly what live did which is why they removed it lol
[16:13:11] <dblosevn> Mage_Dude: you should use the lowest element in the tree as the parent
[16:13:36] <dblosevn> eg $('#yourbox').on('click', 'button', function() {
[16:13:49] <dblosevn> so the events only have to bubble up to #yourbox
[16:13:51] <Mage_Dude> dblosevn: Closer to using delegate()?
[16:14:18] <dblosevn> delegate was removed as well lol, .on took its place too
[16:15:31] <Mage_Dude> Just with choosing the node to bind the selector/action to... But...that won't work if the nodes don't exist correct?
[16:15:48] <dblosevn> the parent has to exist
[16:16:08] <dblosevn> it the children your trying to bind to dont however have to exist yet
[16:16:22] <dblosevn> -it
[16:17:00] <Mage_Dude> I have a messages container that exists only sometimes, so I should go up one level and bind the 'dismiss message' action there...
[16:17:11] <dblosevn> ya
[16:17:21] <dblosevn> try to bind to the cloest immediate parent
[16:18:10] <dblosevn> i kind of like the new .on, replaced `bind,live,delegate`
[16:21:49] <Mage_Dude> Derp. Script action only loads...if there's a message in the initial request...no message, no script, no worky. Time to make it loaded all the time...
[16:28:41] <dblosevn> lol
[16:45:15] <garbagecollectio> hey so
[16:45:30] <garbagecollectio> data-remote automagically sending ajax requests?
[16:49:13] <shoky> data-remote is rails specific i believe
[16:49:20] <garbagecollectio> wtf is this rails shit
[16:49:50] <shoky> a server-side web framework for ruby
[16:51:53] <garbagecollectio> what about $rails
[16:52:08] <shoky> ?
[16:52:51] <garbagecollectio> $.rails
[16:53:54] <shoky> how should i know?
[16:54:13] <shoky> my guess would be a rails-related jquery plugin..
[16:54:27] <kokoat> when you grab html from a div, insert it into another div (not ajax, all divs are in the dom when page loads), do events not work on the injected html?
[16:55:00] <shoky> events work on the elements you attached them to
[16:55:17] <shoky> if you're making new elements, they wont have event handlers attached (directly) to them
[16:55:19] <kokoat> right
[16:55:27] <kokoat> im not making them
[16:55:32] <kokoat> im grabbing them from a hidden div
[16:55:45] <shoky> if you want help with a specific scenario, jsfiddle it
[16:56:49] <shoky> if you're grabbing their HTML then you're not grabbing the elements
[16:56:54] <shoky> you're just grabbing an html string
[16:57:02] <kokoat> that must be it
[16:57:10] <kokoat> but that is the scenario
[16:57:18] <kokoat> so how do i grab it as an object
[16:58:12] <shoky> var jqObj = $('#myDiv');
[16:58:23] <shoky> if you wanna clone it you can use .clone(true)
[16:59:00] <shoky> again, if you want help with a specific scenario, jsfiddle it
[17:01:22] <shoky> kokoat: also it sounds like maybe you should be using event delegation. read about it in .on() docs
[17:01:36] <kokoat> hold on, building jsfiddle
[17:01:44] <shoky> that way you wont need to copy any event handlers
[17:03:46] <kokoat> oh what the hell
[17:03:48] <kokoat> it works in fid
[17:03:59] <kokoat> http://jsfiddle.net/NRADQ/ basically this
[17:04:11] <shoky> wat
[17:04:24] <kokoat> awesome, didnt save
[17:04:34] <shoky> Update
[17:07:38] <kokoat> http://jsfiddle.net/2n46s/1/
[17:07:58] <kokoat> wont work. but if i put the second part inside the first click(), it works
[17:12:03] <kokoat> that normal?
[17:19:29] <shoky> yes
[17:19:38] <shoky> like i said, events work on the elements you attached them to
[17:22:06] <shoky> this doesnt help me see what the scenario is, though.. i can fix it for you in different ways, but i dont know the one that'll actually help you with what you're doing
[17:22:37] <vespakoen> Hey guys, I am having something weird going on with the .animate() function, when I pass in a step method and log the first argument, it shows me a series of something like this: 0, 10, 0, 9, 0, 8, 0, 7, 0, 6 etc, does anyone know what's going on here / can someone confirm or show why it's useful (latest version of jQuery btw)
[17:24:52] <vespakoen> this is my code btw: http://pastie.org/6189551 and "called" only shows up once, so I don't call that method twice or something
[17:26:50] <vespakoen>  @ myself, read the fucking docs -> Note that the step function is called for each animated property on each animated element. For example, given two list items, the step function fires four times at each step of the animation:
[17:27:28] <shoky> great job
[17:31:10] <emankcin> does not work background: 'green' please help http://dpaste.com/hold/933934/
[17:35:16] <shoky> emankcin: because it's taking defaults.background instead of this.options.background
[17:35:45] <shoky> emankcin: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/UMEpc/
[17:37:11] <kokoat> shoky: that is the exact scenario
[17:37:38] <emankcin> shoky: thank you very much :) work

[17:50:22] <joobie> hey guys.. what's a good way to move a div in a smooth motion?
[17:50:23] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[17:50:23] <shoky> the % sign means divide by 100
[17:54:47] <shoky> joobie: css transitions
[17:55:04] <kokoat> shoky: thanks. let me study this
[17:58:49] <kokoat> shoky: interesting. so instead of grabbing the html, grab contrnts(), ?
[17:58:55] <kokoat> and clear the div then append?
[17:59:12] <kokoat> i see it works but i dont see why plain old html() doesnt
[17:59:35] <kokoat> i would think that the html function does just that.. empty() followed by append()|
[18:13:36] <buzzsaw> wow... talk about a full chan :-)
[18:23:10] <shoky> kokoat:  you were grabbing the html and appending that, just an html string (with no events attached to it)

[18:59:33] <ryanneufeld> OnlyMax: see on
[18:59:39] <ryanneufeld> OnlyMax: see ?api on
[18:59:39] <bot-t> OnlyMax, jQuery has very extensive and thorough documentation at api.jquery.com. Please check there before asking questions here. Want to know the args for .on? It's as easy as going to http://api.jquery.com/on/
[19:00:51] <ryanneufeld> OnlyMax: you can bind to the scroll event
[19:00:58] <OnlyMax> hmmmm
[19:01:03] <ryanneufeld> but be warned
[19:01:08] <OnlyMax> ryanneufeld http://pastebin.com/S1yqRd66
[19:01:15] <ryanneufeld> the scroll event can be called MANY times
[19:02:34] <ryanneufeld> OnlyMax: so you need to bind to the scroll event
[19:02:48] <ryanneufeld> and use that to compare how far they've scrolled

[19:12:28] <SeriousMatters> I have a horizontal menu.  on small device it becomes a dropdown-like menu using slideToggle(), which adds style="display:none;" to the element.  All is well, except ...
[19:12:28] <SeriousMatters> if device turns to landscape mode where the dropdown function is not needed, the menu is still on display:none
[19:34:10] <Agamemnus> hello
[19:34:16] <Agamemnus> how can I simplify this code?
[19:34:23] <Agamemnus> http://pastebin.com/1nS48Wqa
[19:34:53] <danheberden> Agamemnus: you mean "simplify" or condense?
[19:35:35] <Agamemnus> simplify.. I'm not sure how to wrangle the code to get text like "M&Ms" from the start.. instead of "M&amp;Ms".
[19:36:39] <danheberden> Agamemnus: is the placeholder attr ok to use?
[19:36:46] <danheberden> cuz, as mentioned in some other channel miles away
[19:36:50] <danheberden> it would make your life easier
[19:38:00] <Agamemnus> i don't get what you're saying.
[19:38:40] <danheberden> <input placeholder"Search Now!" />
[19:38:42] <danheberden> handles it for you
[19:38:46] <danheberden> the default text crap
[19:38:59] <Agamemnus> i don't see what that has to do with anything
[19:40:02] <danheberden> Agamemnus: it would remove your if ( this.default_text === this.search_field.val() )
[19:40:10] <danheberden> because when the user typed something, it would remove the placeholder text
[19:40:17] <danheberden> and if they submitted with the placeholder text in there
[19:40:21] <danheberden> it would submit ""
[19:40:34] <danheberden> `g placeholder html5
[19:40:34] <b-ot> danheberden: HTML5's placeholder Attribute → http://davidwalsh.name/html5-placeholder
[19:40:39] <Agamemnus> the placeholder text is " "
[19:40:49] <Agamemnus> not a problem atm . . .
[19:41:08] <Agamemnus> i couldn't use "" for some reason
[19:41:32] <yogurt_truck> danheberden: lol that's exactly what I said over at the other channel
[19:42:51] <danheberden> yogurt_truck: i was getting so lost
[19:43:00] <danheberden> yogurt_truck: then i was in #vim and was like "this isn't javascript!"
[19:46:57] <yogurt_truck> lol
[20:10:24] <relipse> anyone got any ideas for a drop down menu to insert some text into a textarea or input?
[20:14:32] <Gavilan2> Hi! Is there any library where I can set properties in an intuitive way like left, top, width, height, and it automatically translates them to GPU accelerated things (3D css transitions)? or something like that?
[20:16:08] <Agamemnus> Gavilan2: are you position:absolute??
[20:16:20] <Gavilan2> mmmmm, not really
[20:16:26] <Agamemnus> i mean
[20:16:29] <Agamemnus> looking for*
[20:16:30] <Gavilan2> I'm actually plaing around with an image
[20:16:34] <Gavilan2> zooming it, moving it around
[20:16:44] <Agamemnus> css? what's wrong with that?
[20:16:45] <Gavilan2> and I have some text after the image
[20:16:53] <Gavilan2> Agamemnus: I'm targeting mobile devices
[20:16:59] <Gavilan2> and CSS without GPU is extremelly slow
[20:17:15] <Gavilan2> (That was my first implementation, but it's not fast enough)
[20:17:33] <Gavilan2> then I started doing the same thing with scale...
[20:17:39] <Gavilan2> and it's a lot faster!!!
[20:17:49] <Gavilan2> but using the 3D transformations is somewhat complicated...
[20:17:54] <Agamemnus> jquery is bad with scale
[20:18:04] <Gavilan2> Any library is good for me
[20:18:05] <Agamemnus> it doesn't really support transforms
[20:18:13] <Gavilan2> I just came here, because I supposed someone might know
[20:18:21] <Gavilan2> The thing is that after I scale
[20:18:25] <Agamemnus> i have getabspos_zoom which gives you the absolute position of a transformed element
[20:18:26] <Gavilan2> the "width/height" are unscaled...
[20:18:40] <Gavilan2> so it's difficult to make thing works, because all the DOM seems like it's not scaled...
[20:18:42] <Agamemnus> also a really inefficient recursive function
[20:18:47] <Agamemnus> yes
[20:18:53] <Gavilan2> getabspos_zoom seems usefull
[20:19:00] <Gavilan2> but I need it to be efficient
[20:19:02] <Agamemnus> one thing you can try doing instead of scaling is to use em
[20:19:18] <Gavilan2> for an image?
[20:19:19] <Gavilan2> what?
[20:19:26] <Agamemnus> convert all your pixel units everywhere to em
[20:19:35] <Gavilan2> emmmmmmm
[20:19:41] <Gavilan2> I have an image of 200px x 200px
[20:19:47] <Gavilan2> and then I need to resize it so it fills the screen
[20:19:52] <Gavilan2> how the hell do I do that with ems?
[20:20:02] <Agamemnus> but css scaling is slow you say
[20:20:07] <Gavilan2> nonono
[20:20:09] <Agamemnus> like by setting the width/height
[20:20:10] <Gavilan2> css scaling is really fast
[20:20:13] <Gavilan2> if I use transform: scale
[20:20:20] <Gavilan2> if I use height and width it's slow
[20:20:50] <Agamemnus> you tried px, em, %?
[20:20:57] <Gavilan2> I tried both px and %
[20:21:10] <Gavilan2> I was using css transitions based on with, and they were fast
[20:21:14] <Gavilan2> but not fast enough
[20:21:20] <Gavilan2> then I changed to css transitions using scale
[20:21:26] <Gavilan2> and those blew my mind away xD!
[20:21:45] <Agamemnus> so then you need the scaled with/height
[20:21:54] <Agamemnus> can't you keep track of that separately?
[20:22:24] <Agamemnus> with math
[20:22:31] <Agamemnus> or something
[20:22:33] <Agamemnus> width*
[20:23:12] <relipse> where is the ckeditor support? or can someone help me out? I want to hide the toolbar until it is being used
[20:23:59] <Gavilan2> Agamemnus: I can do the math, but I'd really want a lib to do it for me....
[20:24:55] <Agamemnus> maybe you can just do some sorta wrapper
[20:25:09] <Agamemnus> whenever you do a scale, add that internally
[20:25:11] <Gavilan2> I'd like to get the wrapper from someone :)
[20:25:15] <Agamemnus> unless you're doing matrix math?
[20:25:25] <Agamemnus> ie rotations
[20:25:29] <Gavilan2> nope, just translations + scales in 2d
[20:25:49] <Agamemnus> well
[20:26:01] <Agamemnus> take a look at my getabspos_zoom, maybe it will give you some ideas
[20:26:33] <Agamemnus> oops, findabsposd
[20:26:55] <Gavilan2> where can I get that thing?
[20:27:18] <Agamemnus> here is kinda the whole enchilada http://pastebin.com/xqY0j2RQ
[20:27:26] <Agamemnus> starts on line 42
[20:27:50] <Agamemnus> getTransformString might be useful
[20:29:05] <Gavilan2> who's the author?
[20:29:27] <Agamemnus> me
[20:29:34] <Gavilan2> oh
[20:29:38] <Gavilan2> and what's the license of your code?
[20:29:39] <Gavilan2> :)
[20:30:01] <Agamemnus> public domain my friend
[20:30:20] <Agamemnus> except for the tiny clause that says you have to give me a million bux per use
[20:30:31] <Gavilan2> oh :(
[20:32:12] <Gavilan2> great, is there any library for lazy-loading images.... I have multiple versions of the same image with different sizes... When I need to change the size, I need to do a scale, and start loading the image, and replace it as soon as it's loaded... is there any library for that?
[20:32:51] <Agamemnus> shouldn't the browser handle this?
[20:32:54] <relipse> does anyone know how to turn off the ckeditor toolbar until the user clicks inside of it?
[20:33:23] <Agamemnus> relipse: set its visibility to hidden?
[20:33:59] <Gavilan2> Agamemnus: Mmm I don't think so, given that he doesn't know what I'm doing....
[20:35:06] <Agamemnus> it should cache the image when it is loaded, pretty sure.
[20:35:25] <Agamemnus> try it
[20:35:27] <Gavilan2> nono, but
[20:35:33] <Agamemnus> what?
[20:35:40] <Gavilan2> I have imageA20x20.jpg
[20:35:42] <Agamemnus> k
[20:35:48] <Gavilan2> but now I want to change it for imageA40x40.jpg
[20:35:52] <Agamemnus> k
[20:36:03] <Gavilan2> I start the animation to resize it to 40x40, so it'll look bad, given that it has a lower resolution
[20:36:14] <Agamemnus> wrapper
[20:36:16] <Gavilan2> and I start loading  imageA40x40.jpg  in the background
[20:36:20] <Agamemnus> otherwise i dunno
[20:36:27] <Gavilan2> as soon as imageA40x40.jpg  is loaded, I replace the small image with the big one
[20:36:35] <Agamemnus> you can load them all at once too
[20:36:47] <Gavilan2> I don't want to, because I'm not sure if I'll need to
[20:37:09] <Gavilan2> at least, I want to specify the order in which they are loaded....
[20:37:31] <Agamemnus> you can write a function to chain load events recursively
[20:38:17] <Agamemnus> load... when loaded, replace the src
[20:38:19] <Agamemnus> and so on
[20:38:35] <Agamemnus> it does seem like you are reinventing the wheel possibly
[20:39:06] <Agamemnus> jpegs have the option of being progressively loaded, or maybe all images not sure
[20:39:38] <Agamemnus> http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/12/progressive-image-rendering.html
[20:39:56] <Agamemnus> note, 2005
[20:41:00] <Agamemnus> read the last comment
[20:42:08] <Gavilan2> Agamemnus: That's a completely different thing...
[20:44:15] <Agamemnus> not so sure
[20:44:23] <Agamemnus> unless your images are actually different
[20:44:32] <Agamemnus> well
[20:44:36] <Agamemnus> ok it's different
[20:44:38] <Agamemnus> BUUT
[20:44:39] <Agamemnus> i'm sick.
[20:45:10] <Agamemnus> it's different only if you should specify at what sizes to change over to more high res images
[20:45:37] <Agamemnus> dunno of any libraries for that though, i think it's probably faster to make your own
[20:45:53] <Agamemnus> or plugins/etc.
[20:51:55] <relipse> does anyone know how to make the save button work in ckeditor 4.0.1
[20:52:35] <danheberden> relipse: seriously http://danheberden.com/share/0904.png
[20:57:39] <amh345> hi guys. im looking for a real simple jquery mp3 player for a site.  something with a tracklist.  and recommendations?
[20:59:15] <amh345> jplayer looks like it might be the one
[21:23:25] <relipse> danheberden: how did you get that screenshot?
[21:24:04] <danheberden> relipse: i opened my screenshot tool and click'd and drag
[21:25:31] <WilliamRoberts> HOwdy!
[21:26:45] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: Hello!
[21:28:34] <WilliamRoberts> I have a general question, I'm pretty new to jquery, and not the best at javascript, I mostly do backend stuff.
[21:29:08] <WilliamRoberts> But I started a simple app, and when I pass a new value to a textarea, the user can no longer edit the text area.
[21:29:14] <WilliamRoberts> How would I go about debugging this?
[21:29:25] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: how are you "passing a new value" to the text area?
[21:29:41] <WilliamRoberts> I'm sure I will run into more issues like this as I go, so wondering about the debugging process
[21:29:47] <danheberden> as for debugging, when i hit that kind of thing, i do a few things
[21:29:53] <danheberden> 1) i inspect the element in chrome dev tools
[21:29:58] <danheberden> that way i can see what's happening to it
[21:30:11] <danheberden> maybe i did something wonky to the element?
[21:30:37] <danheberden> 2) do what i'm doing, but on a small scale - fire up jsfiddle.net or something and make a textarea, some simple javascript using jQuery to do the same ting
[21:30:38] <WilliamRoberts> I am using an ajax call to call a php script and retunr html
[21:30:39] <danheberden> *thing
[21:30:48] <danheberden> but in a controlled environment
[21:30:53] <callkalpa> I have a set of select elements which are dynamically added to the page, .each doesn't work on them. do I need to tell in advance that there will be a set of select elements?
[21:31:06] <WilliamRoberts>  $editwindow.val(text)
[21:31:18] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: two things
[21:31:22] <WilliamRoberts> with $editwindow set to var $editwindow = $("textarea[id=webcomp-editor]");
[21:31:37] <danheberden> Whoa
[21:31:41] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: first little bit
[21:31:48] <danheberden> since ID's are *always* unique
[21:32:00] <danheberden> you don't need to specify at all that it's a text area
[21:32:06] <danheberden> $('#webcomp-editor')
[21:32:08] <danheberden> is much better
[21:32:09] <WilliamRoberts> Ahh, good to know..
[21:32:25] <danheberden> also, if for some reason you needed to specify the tagname
[21:32:37] <danheberden> textarea#webcomp-editor would also be better
[21:32:39] <danheberden> BUT i digress
[21:32:50] <WilliamRoberts> No that is all good info...
[21:33:24] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: i am concerned the 'text' in your fn call isn't good
[21:33:30] <danheberden> like, it might be wonky stuff
[21:33:40] <WilliamRoberts> And the weird bit, if I only pass back a small amount of info, say 3 lines, it works.. more then that, and the user can't type in firefox and chrome
[21:33:48] <WilliamRoberts> didn't check ie, but opera works..
[21:33:53] <danheberden> either set a breakpoint in dev-tools, or console.log(text) or debugger;
[21:34:31] <WilliamRoberts> ok!  I will try the console.log(text) yeah I have been using alert() for most my debugging, I knew there had to be a better way
[21:34:47] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: length shouldn't matter
[21:35:04] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: try just 'debugger' as a keyword
[21:35:11] <danheberden> you might like that too
[21:35:16] <danheberden> it opens up as if you had set a breakpoint
[21:35:20] <danheberden> and lets you see all the things
[21:36:27] <WilliamRoberts> Awesome.  Thanks for the help I will take a look.  So far I'm liking it a lot, being able to edit the DOM on the fly but still calling php code to update parts is very nice.
[21:40:47] <WilliamRoberts> And Dan, using $('#idname') works like a champ, thats is going to clean up a lot so I don't have to set all these vars I thought I did to clean it up.  thanks
[21:41:26] <danheberden> WilliamRoberts: you might like jqfundamentals.com
[21:43:00] <WilliamRoberts> I will check it out.  I was using the api documentation, which really you need to know this better then what I do to do it correctly.
[21:43:46] <tfittsy> anyone here use select2 or is good at reading through jquery function code?  I'm trying to use a feature that I'm pretty sure was committed but that I can't find simple documentation on.
[21:44:05] <tfittsy> sorry, this isn't specific to jquery, it's for the select2 addon, I'm not sure if that was clear from my question.
[21:44:44] <relipse> i'm using bootstrap, and jquery and some other libraries, how come my page text starts out one size and then it seems like after the page is done loading, it resizes smaller? the fact that it changes is kind of ugly
[21:44:48] <relipse> tfitts: i do yes
[21:44:56] <relipse> i love it actually
[21:45:02] <relipse> used it for 2 of my different websites
[21:45:13] <relipse> the documentation and examples are pretty good
[21:45:19] <tfittsy> relipse, do you load data through json or just convert regular dropdowns?
[21:45:25] <relipse> both
[21:45:31] <tfittsy> do you use optgroups?
[21:45:39] <relipse> right now i'm working with a json loader because of the massive size of the database
[21:45:47] <relipse> no haven't used optgroups yet
[21:46:09] <tfittsy> I'm trying to use: https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/58 but I'm having trouble figuring out how to format the json data to make it show in groups.
[21:46:09] <b-ot> tfittsy: Issue #58 by choxnox (9mon 20h 45m 44s): Add support for OPTGROUPs?
[21:46:35] <relipse> well you do know that the json example formats it its own way, right?
[21:48:13] <relipse> yeah i'm not even using optgroups, my data is custom formatted
[21:48:18] <tfittsy> yeah, I'm using json data, I just don't see where it shows how to format the json for grouping.
[21:48:28] <digitalmediaguy> How can I call another function from within a function using jQuery?  in php it would be like $this->functionName()
[21:48:34] <relipse> looks like they didnt add the feature yet
[21:48:46] <relipse> digitalmediaguy: umm what?
[21:49:14] <tfittsy> oh, my bad.  I see that now.
[21:50:03] <digitalmediaguy> in php if two functions are in a class… you can call or "use" other functions like $this->function();
[21:50:19] <tfittsy> relipse: wait, doesn't it say he closed the issue from a commit? doesn't that mean it's in now?
[21:50:42] <relipse> i dunno i dont have time to read it
[21:50:51] <tfittsy> ok
[21:56:35] <danheberden> lol
[22:19:26] <WilliamRoberts> Do you have to do a flush or soemthing after an ajax call?  I'm updating a val of text field, then updating another field with the length, and the length update is happening before the text field is filled.
[22:24:25] <sahbeewah> WilliamRoberts, no you don't need to flush anything
[22:24:33] <sahbeewah> paste some code if you want some specific help
[22:25:38] <WilliamRoberts> http://pastebin.com/download.php?i=SMggnwze
[22:26:10] <WilliamRoberts> I'm doing an ajax call, then I put an alert to see what the length of the text area is, and it is the length prior to to the ajax call...
[22:26:51] <CoolCoder> I have a form where there it can add multiple contacts(this elements are added through AJAX). On validating this form, it works. But when I hide any element(jQuery('element').hide()), the validation still works on this hidden element. Validation is written on jQuery('form').submit(fu..
[22:27:04] <CoolCoder> how to solve this issue?
[22:27:04] <WilliamRoberts> And I'm new so feel free to ream me if I'm doing it wrong...
[22:27:07] <sahbeewah> WilliamRoberts, that's because that code underneath the ajax call (will in almost all situations) run before the success callback of your ajax
[22:27:36] <sahbeewah> the ajax call gets called asynchronously, so that other code can run while the ajax is doing its own thing
[22:27:38] <WilliamRoberts> Thats what I figured, is there a way to wait for the ajax call to finish?
[22:27:55] <WilliamRoberts> Ahh so switch to sync?  I was looking at the api
[22:28:30] <sahbeewah> you could change it to be synchronous, but that kinda defeats the purpose of ajax
[22:28:55] <sahbeewah> why don't you just do it in the success callback?
[22:29:09] <WilliamRoberts> Ahh!
[22:29:25] <WilliamRoberts> ok... sync did work, but that is probably the better way... thanks
[22:30:02] <WilliamRoberts> That worked like a champ, thanks...
[22:31:12] <sahbeewah> CoolCoder, what's the issue? you don't want the validation to check hidden elements?
[22:31:23] <CoolCoder> yes
[22:31:26] <relipse> does anyone know of a good pop up helper hint text (that you can select) maybe a mini dialog?
[22:32:35] <sahbeewah> CoolCoder, not really sure how your validation is checking it, but if you have access to the input element, you can do something like, if($(this).is(":visible")) { ... }
[22:32:41] <sahbeewah> given that "this" is the input
[22:32:49] <CoolCoder> ok
[22:48:06] <raymond> hi everybody
[22:48:18] <raymond> hope you are all doing well
[22:48:33] <raymond> I was just wondering about jquery 1.9.1...
[22:49:25] <_zoggy_> 1.10.1
[22:49:28] <_zoggy_> need to update topic
[22:50:03] <raymond> oh I'm sorry, is this the wrong room?
[22:50:33] <raymond> this is my first time here, so please direct me elsewhere if I've misplaced myself ;-)
[22:53:24] <raymond> well anyways, ever since I upgraded to jquery 1.9.1, my ajax calls seem to end up using the wrong callback function
[22:53:44] <raymond> I have .ajax(), .done(), and .fail()
[22:53:58] <raymond> with jquery 1.7.1, this worked perfectly
[22:54:09] <raymond> but with 1.9.1, it doesn't
[22:54:37] <raymond> the ajax function (specified in the url) is performed correctly (meaning the update to the database table is successful)
[22:54:54] <raymond> but on return, the fail() function is performed, instead of the done() function
[22:55:21] <raymond> anyone out there who can shine some light on the issue? or is it a bug that has already been reported?
[23:07:52] <relipse> anyone here use qtip2?
[23:11:47] <relipse> does anyone know why qtip2 displays 2 tool tips? i have to close each one
[23:12:50] <_zoggy_> raymond, that stuff got depreciated in 1.9.x you need to use migrate to see the warnings
[23:13:09] <_zoggy_> or just update your code to the newer/supported stuff (was implmented awhile ago)
[23:30:42] <raymond> hey zoggy, thanks!
[23:30:51] <raymond> I used the migrate plugin as well
[23:30:59] <raymond> sorry, forgot to mention that before
[23:31:19] <raymond> but the migrate plugin did not show any messages
[23:31:25] <raymond> other than that it was running
[23:31:42] <raymond> either way, if done and fail are deprecated, I obviously need to update those
[23:32:22] <prefix> what would I use to get the number in a <span> and add one?
[23:38:40] <raymond> prefix, maybe this will help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2064186/how-can-i-make-a-jquery-countdown
[23:39:25] <raymond> it's not a tailor made script for what you need, but I think it should enable you to work up a solution of your own
[23:39:48] <prefix> I'm really close
[23:39:58] <prefix> how do I add to an integer though?
[23:41:53] <goddard> when doing something like this how can i interject an if statement before it changes the text $("#review-accordion").find("h3").next().find("b").text("+");
[23:41:56] <prefix> ok
[23:41:57] <prefix> got it
[23:42:21] <raymond> use this: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp
[23:42:26] <raymond> oh ok, lol
[23:42:32] <raymond> great, good on ya!
[23:47:47] <raymond> all right, I'm out...zoggy, thanks again for your help
[23:47:51] <raymond> have a good one!
[23:47:57] <_zoggy_> late
