[00:00:22] <bepolite> <Celelibi> Is there a way to see what are the functions waiting for the document to be loaded before being executed?
[00:00:39] <bepolite> Can you use dev tools to inspect js code?
[00:00:49] <bepolite> or firebug
[00:00:50] <Celelibi> Sure, I can use firebug.
[00:01:11] <Celelibi> But my own code is lost within an ocean of other javascript code and everything is dynamically loaded.
[00:03:51] <bepolite> Celelibi: Ususually, people place such functions insise $(document).ready(...)
[00:04:01] <bepolite> Maybe you should check for such  a block
[00:04:36] <Celelibi> Yes, the code I want mine to run after is within a $(document).ready. So I did the same with my code.
[00:04:36] <JosefDe> Mouseover effect with qtip works. But each time I do mouseover and the tooltip is shown, but I get the error I told
[00:04:39] <bepolite> Also, For you to get all the functions that are set to execute when the document ready event is fired, you have to use dev tools
[00:04:52] <Celelibi> But then, what's the order?
[00:05:01] <bepolite> The order is top to bottom
[00:05:16] <Celelibi> Ok, so my script is loaded too early.
[00:05:21] <bepolite> just like any javascript code
[00:05:39] <bepolite> Celelibi: So you want your script to run last?
[00:05:54] <bepolite> you could try using $(window).load()
[00:06:02] <Celelibi> Yes, it modifies something that should have been set up by another script.
[00:06:15] <bepolite> But a better solution will  be to use callbacks
[00:07:02] <Celelibi> I don't have control over that other code.
[00:07:38] <MeiR-> JosefDe, please set external scripts in the fiddle
[00:07:59] <MeiR-> and the corresponding html
[00:09:03] <JosefDe> ok
[00:10:06] <JosefDe> MeiR-: I've set it: http://jsfiddle.net/josefde80/wvk3aohr/1/
[00:14:44] <MeiR-> JosefDe, i'm sorry but it's not propely set yet, i fixed it manually to be: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/qtip2/2.2.1/jquery.qtip.min.js
[00:15:09] <MeiR-> but now it yells about https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/qtip2/2.2.1/jquery.qtip.min.js.map which isn't found
[00:16:05] <JosefDe> .map?
[00:16:09] <JosefDe> let me have a loo
[00:16:24] <MeiR-> yeah. look here: http://jsfiddle.net/wvk3aohr/2/
[00:16:30] <bepolite> Celelibi: Why is it important that such a code  function runs before yours
[00:16:40] <MeiR-> it's the updated with the correct link to qtip
[00:17:01] <Celelibi> bepolite: is set ups some stuff my code try to modify.
[00:17:14] <MeiR-> JosefDe, i'm afraid i got to go, so i'll tell you what i do in these cases. i put in several places: console.log("entered function X");
[00:17:24] <bepolite> Celelibi: Okay then just place your code after the other code
[00:17:28] <MeiR-> or "entered if" or "entered loop" etc.
[00:17:37] <MeiR-> and then i catch what errors
[00:18:01] <MeiR-> sorry that i cannot help more than that
[00:18:05] <bepolite> Celelibi: such that the other code runs first, then your code runs later
[00:18:07] <Celelibi> bepolite: I don't really control the order of the code. These are modules of extensions mediawiki.
[00:19:01] <bepolite> Celelibi: The order of the code is determined by how they are placed in an HTML document or in a javascript file
[00:19:32] <Celelibi> And I don't write a single line of html.
[00:20:03] <JosefDe> ok. So I'm left alone .. Thanks
[00:22:13] <Celelibi> bepolite: all those modules are dynamically loaded.
[00:22:28] <JosefDe> I fixed it..
[00:23:33] <JosefDe> No I havent :(
[00:24:02] <bepolite> Celelibi: A dirty hack will be for you to use setTimeout() to ensure that your code runs after X seconds
[00:24:17] <bepolite> given that the other code should have finished executing by then
[00:24:51] <bepolite> But to understand you further,  'You want a piece of code to run each time some function finishes running' right?
[00:26:27] <Celelibi> Actually, I can't even locate the function setting up the UI. All I know is that my alert() shows up before the UI is constructed and I assume this is the cause of the code next not working.
[00:28:27] <Celelibi> Everything is so bloated nowadays.
[00:29:00] <Celelibi> Browsers are bloated, websites are bloated, both on the client and server side.
[00:31:55] <bepolite> lol
[00:32:02] <bepolite> Celelibi: unbloat it??
[00:32:14] <Celelibi> I wish.
[00:32:24] <Celelibi> A big rm -fr / :)
[00:39:53] <bepolite> Celelibi: So you want your function to run only when the UI has been set?
[00:40:14] <bepolite> You can use setTimeout to keep looping and checking if the UI is set before it runs your function
[00:42:38] <Celelibi> Oh wait, there is a callback mechanism.
[00:45:08] <bepolite> hahahah
[00:45:41] <bepolite> I think callbacks  are what gives javascript its strength
[00:46:04] <Celelibi> Callbacks are hell.
[00:46:19] <Celelibi> Actually, javascript is a pretty fucked up language.
[00:46:38] <bepolite> why are callbacks hell?
[00:47:25] <Celelibi> Nearly impossible to analyze. They make you lose all the structureness of your program.
[00:47:45] <Celelibi> It's like we're back into a spaghetti of gotos, like back in the days.
[00:48:00] <bepolite> "impossible to analizye"
[00:48:00] <bepolite> ?
[00:48:04] <bepolite> It isnt to me
[00:48:47] <Celelibi> On code you wrote, sure you know how it behaves.
[00:49:21] <Celelibi> But you can't hide that the control-flow is just a lot more complex that a simple call tree.
[00:50:41] <_1_Soraj143S> Hi
[00:50:48] <bepolite> hello _1_Soraj143S
[00:50:54] <Celelibi> But javascript in general is a mess. It has weird scoping rules, funny handling of references / closures. And it is untyped.
[00:51:12] <bepolite> hahahah  Celelibi I don't see your case
[00:51:22] <bepolite> untyped?
[00:51:28] <bepolite> LoL
[00:51:41] <_1_Soraj143S> hahahahahah
[00:52:31] <Celelibi> Well, I mean dynamically and weakly typed if you will.
[00:52:58] <Celelibi> And that point is (or actually should) be a show stopper for anything larger than a toy.
[00:53:44] <_1_Soraj143S> ok
[00:57:52] <_1_Soraj143S> Hello Hrusti
[00:58:22] <hrusti> _1_Soraj143S: _o/
[00:58:54] <_1_Soraj143S> How are you
[01:00:07] <hrusti> fine thanks, and you?
[01:00:41] <_1_Soraj143S> Fine, thanks
[01:10:19] <_1_Soraj143S> (L) hrusti
[01:10:40] <hrusti> (L) ?
[01:10:58] <_1_Soraj143S> hahahahaha
[01:12:01] <_1_Soraj143S> Hrusti, where are you from
[01:12:52] <hrusti> _1_Soraj143S: from Slovenia, if you know where that is :)
[01:13:42] <_1_Soraj143S> No, hrusti
[01:15:24] <hrusti> :)
[01:16:03] <hrusti> google does :)
[01:24:36] <JosefDe> Hey guys. I want a jquery function to be called if something in dom is changed. How can I do this?
[01:25:19] <JosefDe> Exactly: I want to react if the html of a div is changed
[01:28:14] <hrusti> JosefDe: what can change your html?
[01:29:19] <JosefDe> hursti: I'm doing ajax request and changing the content of a div. This div contains qtip elements, which have to be re-initialized
[01:30:26] <hrusti> JosefDe: so call your function in ajax success ?
[01:31:09] <JosefDe> correct
[01:31:58] <hrusti> so I dont understand what is the problem?
[01:32:18] <JosefDe> I'm doing renitializing-call inside my ajax-function, but somehow the newly inserted div is not initialized with qtip
[01:33:50] <hrusti> you want to change content of qtip?
[01:34:25] <arthurvr> Hey all
[01:34:52] <JosefDe> I want qtip to renitialize the newly inserted div element
[01:36:31] <hrusti> idk what qtip is but I guess is some plugin? So maybe it has some function to change content? Or destroy object before reinitialize it?
[01:37:18] <JosefDe> But why shall I destroy object, if it hasn't been created for this newly inserted div yet?
[01:41:21] <serge> I've got a question
[01:42:56] <serge> should I minify jQuery (and all my other dependencies) and concat them all in one file or load them all over a CDN (eg google ajax apis)? It does kind of feel like a conflicting best practice these days.
[01:43:26] <arthurvr> serge: I’ve got endless discussions like that, but it just depends on your situation.
[01:43:58] <serge> And should I inline them all? another Q
[01:44:20] <arthurvr> serge: generally that depends on the size of your actual files
[01:44:36] <serge> okay so I should just profile it?
[01:44:51] <arthurvr> Well yeah profiling is always a little tricky but try to measure it in some way
[01:45:10] <arthurvr> there are analytics services that let you collect data of how many users get cached versions, for example.
[01:45:17] <serge> oh well that's quite cool arthurvr
[01:45:18] <serge> thank you
[01:46:21] <arthurvr> serge: another tip I can give is this tool: https://github.com/addyosmani/critical by addy
[01:46:36] <arthurvr> serge: which lets you only inline critical path CSS.
[01:52:51] <serge> arthurvr: looking into it
[01:52:56] <serge> sound nice
[01:53:03] <serge> thanksx
[01:53:10] <serge> ya rock

[04:47:57] <Meline> Hi everybody. How can I access the "this"-pointer of the outer class inside $(document).ready() ?
[04:50:34] <sammich> save it as something
[04:50:47] <sammich> var self = this;
[04:50:50] <sammich> var that = this;
[04:50:53] <sammich> var _this = this;
[04:51:05] <Meline> I've done it. Doesn't help
[04:51:36] <sammich> need to see your code. Throw it on jsfiddle.net or similar
[04:53:12] <Meline> Oh ok fixed it
[04:53:28] <Meline> The problem was, that I did this inside the function and there "this" refers to the function and not the class
[05:26:28] <purpleit> hi guys! I'm to add css to an element when it loads. So should I write something like $('target').on('load', function()); or this is the wrong way of doing so?
[05:27:51] <arthurvr> purpleit: that would actually be a syntax error lol
[05:28:01] <arthurvr> purpleit: the function defenition
[05:28:10] <arthurvr> ~definition
[05:28:14] * arthurvr can’t spell
[05:28:28] <purpleit> arthurvr: just to know what should be the proper event on place of 'load'?
[05:30:23] <sammich> doesn't 'load' only work on the body element?
[05:30:31] <purpleit> here is what I'm trying to accomplish http://pastebin.com/MHPLMmnk
[05:30:31] <sammich> and..well, XHR objects
[05:31:11] <purpleit> sammich: so what should I use for child elements of body?
[05:31:45] <sammich> what exactly is
[05:31:47] <sammich> loading*
[05:31:57] <sammich> how are you loading it - is the question
[05:36:06] <purpleit> I want to run that function when site loads
[05:37:43] <sammich> is .footer-widget in the document or generated dynamically?
[05:38:46] <sammich> because if the content is static, then http://pastebin.com/DXfGzvhR will do the trick
[05:39:23] <sammich> jQuery(function() { // runs after the page is loaded })
[05:41:50] <purpleit> sammich: no that's generated dynamically
[05:42:25] <sammich> well, the easiest way is to use CSS, then
[05:43:13] <purpleit> sammich: what if I want to add/remove class from the element when the site load?
[05:43:41] <sammich> I don't know enough of your situation to suggest a solution
[05:44:01] <sammich> is this a CMS or something?
[05:44:14] <sammich> wordpress?
[05:44:26] <purpleit> ya wordpress
[05:44:49] <purpleit> and I've created that widget area in the footer section
[05:45:20] <sammich> do you always want the red border on the 3rd element of type?
[05:45:41] <purpleit> sammich: no just for testing purpose
[05:46:13] <sammich> is this a live site?
[05:50:31] <purpleit> ya live site
[05:51:29] <sammich> are you injecting this code into the live site, or running it from console, or something?
[05:52:30] <purpleit> sammich: I've ftp access to the site and I write my code in main.js file and upload it via ftp.
[05:53:08] <sammich> can you just add some CSS somewhere to make this work for you?
[05:54:35] <purpleit> actually I wanted to try addClass or removeClass method in a function that will be run on loading of the site
[05:56:04] <axaryk> $( document ).ready(function() {
[05:56:04] <axaryk> });
[05:57:25] <axaryk> and inside $( "h" ).addClass( "myClass" );?
[05:57:46] <purpleit> arthurvr, sammich, axaryk, I'm very glad to meet you guys. I appreciate your valuable times :)
[05:58:10] <arthurvr> purpleit: ha! and I didn’t do anything :) But hey, you’re welcome!
[05:59:40] <axaryk> Thanks, really, it's my first time here XD
[06:43:17] <devster31> hi, don't know if I can ask here, I have http://jsfiddle.net/vbq2yb7y/4/ as my best attempt, the intended behaviour would be for the sticky post to be 100% wide or max-width, but centered, and the rest below, 50% wide or max-width, centered, adding columns as there is space, post-navigation is covered by the layout too
[06:45:33] <serge> Does someone know if Arthur is around?
[06:45:36] <serge> arthurvr you here?
[06:45:49] <arthurvr> sup serge?
[06:46:00] <serge> hey arthurvr
[06:46:06] <serge> I need a performance suggestion, again.
[06:46:12] <arthurvr> haha okay shoot
[06:46:19] <serge> you've got five minutes?
[06:46:46] <arthurvr> no but just ask. The rest of the channel might be able to answer, and I come back in a hour or so so stick around
[06:46:55] <serge> okay so here comes my question
[06:47:06] <serge> You want a jsfiddle isn't it?
[06:47:10] <arthurvr> preferably
[06:47:23] <serge> coming
[06:47:24] <serge> see ya

[07:57:12] <Sinauth> Hi, I have a working JQuery menu (top nav) on my main page [ http://www.chandlercomputers.co.uk/index.php#contact ] however I have put the same .js and .css into my Prestashop store, it works but the menu sub-toggle does not expand down. Any ideas please?  [ http://www.chandlercomputers.co.uk/shop/index.php ]
[08:43:46] <devster31> hi, can anyone help me with Isotope? I have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/vbq2yb7y/4/ my best attempt at having 2 centered columns that scale to more than 2 when there's space
[09:08:45] <bewilled> Anyone recommend me a way to swipe to another url, but with an animation while swiping, sort of like tinder for jqm?
[09:12:17] <cjohnson> devster31: describing your specific issue might help
[09:12:54] <cjohnson> bewilled: on the same site?
[09:13:40] <bewilled> cjohnson, yes, its a url that is dynamic (always uniq for certain situations)
[09:14:47] <cjohnson> if it's a url on the same site, you could ideally switch the pages to load dynamically via ajax
[09:14:50] <cjohnson> instead of normal links
[09:15:00] <cjohnson> though you'll want to make sure the site works with JS disabled / for the purposes of SEO
[09:15:17] <devster31> the issue is that it doesn't behave as intended, I don't think I understand well how Isotope works. in the example resizing results in a mess, and below a certain width there's only 1 column with the elements at 49% width, however what I wanted to do was have 2 elements at 50% width, which grow in size, up to the max-size, then they stay centered until there's room for 1 more column, and they add a third element, also, sticky and navigation
[09:15:17] <devster31>  should stick to top and bottom, but I think that's the easiest part. I'd be grateful for any kind of help
[09:15:40] <cjohnson> if not you can use the $(document).ready() event to fire a sort of wipe transition on the body to simulate it fading from the previous one
[09:16:18] <cjohnson> can I suggest a standard CSS grid instead devster31? it would solve this problem I think
[09:17:12] <devster31> I tried with Inline-block, float and flexbox, even tried with columns, they all have their issues, but the standard ones are that for different-height elements there's a lot of whitespace between elements in the same column if the element in the other is way longer
[09:17:44] <devster31> if I had same-height content this wouldn't be an issue
[09:19:42] <devster31> I thought about dividing the issue into 2 compartment, before max-width and after
[09:19:54] <cjohnson> devster31: http://jsfiddle.net/wzu12fzk/1/
[09:20:04] <cjohnson> using bootstrap which is the grid I'm familiar with
[09:20:16] <cjohnson> it boils down to using media quaries so you could just do that by hand if you wanted
[09:20:44] <bewilled> cjohnson, this transition will fire up after the swipe event is triggered or during the swipe?
[09:20:59] <cjohnson> notice how the it's xs-6 but md-4
[09:21:25] <devster31> http://jsfiddle.net/wzu12fzk/2/ this is the problem I might have with css grid
[09:21:26] <cjohnson> bewilled: depends how you do it. probably most certainly after, I'm not even sure the state of supporting "swipes" via JS
[09:21:49] <cjohnson> I don't see how a JS solution solves that devster31
[09:22:01] <devster31> masonry does it, kind of
[09:24:06] <devster31> http://jsfiddle.net/wzu12fzk/3/
[10:17:52] <marrrk> Hello. How can I make it so that when I remove a child in a list of items the ones below are smoothly moved into their new position?
[10:40:55] <abijeet> marrrk, i'd assume that it would require you to gradually reduce the height of the list element to 0 and then remove it.
[10:41:16] <marrrk> sounds like a good hack
[10:41:49] <abijeet> jquery animate might do something like that already
[10:42:21] <abijeet> http://jsfiddle.net/jomanlk/JJh9z/1/ << found this on SO
[10:42:32] <abijeet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5616823/jquery-change-height-of-div-on-button-click
[10:43:50] <abijeet> so in the animate complete callback you could remove the element.

[13:50:06] <Katronix> Hi all, I was curious if someone could look at my code at http://mjmagic.greensnakedesign.com/forward.php and suggest where my issue is? for some reason I can't find the form doesnt do the form validation like it should :(
[13:52:06] <bepolite> Katronix: how was it suposed to do form validation?
[13:52:18] <bepolite> Can you write a fiddle?
[13:52:42] <Katronix> bepolite: Its supposed to use the code from FormVerification.io
[13:52:43] <bepolite> You got some javascript errors though
[13:53:04] <Katronix> http://mjmagic.greensnakedesign.com/test.htm this works perfectly
[13:54:17] <Katronix> bepolite I assume you mean the one on line 125?

[14:01:01] <albedoa> http://jsfiddle.net/cvv8rzjr/ i need #result to always show *only* what is selected. it doesn't if you highlight the same thing twice. anyone got an idea?
[14:04:47] <bepolite> well albedoa i can't seem to be able to hightlight the same thing twice
[14:04:59] <albedoa> bepolite same
[14:06:23] <bepolite> albedoa: http://jsfiddle.net/cvv8rzjr/1/
[14:06:37] <bepolite> Is that the expected results you want
[14:07:14] <albedoa> bepolite no because when you unhighlight, the result doesn't change to ''
[14:07:24] <albedoa> i need it to clear when you unhighlight
[14:07:40] <Woet> albedoa: you don't clear your 'selection' variable when you set #result to ''
[14:07:59] <Woet> so even though #result is empty, the variable still contains the last selection and won't re-populate #result.
[14:08:57] <albedoa> Woet boom, thanks!
[14:09:24] <albedoa> thought i had tried every combo of the conditions
[14:09:29] <albedoa> thanks to you too bepolite

[15:52:01] <Guest97368> Question: If else statement using jquery. Ajax call returns JSON object - some with array and some with empty array.  Both keep returning as if array is not empty.  On the console I can clearly see one object returned with [object, object, object] and the other [null] - but with if else it is not working. This jsfiddle shows a snippet of the if else statement.  https://jsfiddle.net/creatordotjs/rLofaxfx/2/
[15:54:12] <bepolite> Guest97368: try  "console.log(data)"
[15:54:30] <bepolite> Which block runs
[15:54:37] <bepolite> ? The if block or the else block?
[15:55:24] <Guest97368> else for both
[15:57:18] <Guest97368> When I tried this they also both returned false - even on null var isTrue = $.isEmptyObject(data);
[15:57:51] <Guest97368> var isTrue = $.isEmptyObject(data);
[16:01:56] <albedoa> what is the recommended version of jquery?
[16:04:57] <bepolite> albedoa: latest stable?
[16:05:08] <bepolite> But it depends if you want support for older IE
[16:05:10] <bepolite> or not
[16:05:20] <albedoa> okay thank you
[16:10:40] <bepolite> Guest97368: console.log(data)
[16:10:45] <bepolite> give us the output of that
[16:15:58] <Guest97368> bepolite: in chrome - [Object, Object, Object ]0: Object1: Object2: Object
[16:16:11] <Guest97368> or [null]
[16:16:42] <bepolite> You can always inspect the objects
[16:17:11] <Guest97368> 0: ObjectPropName: "prop"propID: 4userID: 11
[16:18:12] <Guest97368> the output is working.  the [null] says undefined on the output
[16:18:32] <bepolite> which ouput?
[16:18:38] <Guest97368> output to the browser
[16:18:43] <Guest97368> window
[16:19:19] <Guest97368> Is that what you mean by inspecting the objects?
[16:20:04] <bepolite> Yep
[16:20:06] <Guest97368> Should my backend developer return something other than an empty array to help me on my end?
[16:20:16] <Guest97368> ajax/json
[16:20:39] <bepolite> Guest97368:  have you tried doing  "if (data == = null) {...}"?
[16:21:04] <Guest97368> I think so - let me try again, just to be safe. brb
[16:22:44] <Guest97368> yes. same result
[16:22:48] <Guest97368> else block
[16:22:54] <bepolite> Guest97368:  have you tried doing  "if (data.length == 1 && data[0] = = null) {...}"?
[16:23:21] <bepolite> Guest97368: what really happens is that your data variable is not undefined
[16:23:47] <bepolite> It is actually a 1 dimentional array with 1 element which is null
[16:23:52] <Guest97368> no. let me try that.
[16:26:20] <Guest97368> OMG! That worked. Okay, let me digest this here.
[16:26:22] <bepolite> You can try  "if (data.length === 1 && data[0] === null) {  ... }" to be safe
[16:26:38] <bepolite> LOL it isn't majic
[16:27:06] <Guest97368> after 3 hours it is
[16:27:08] <bepolite> Guest97368: Your "data" variable is a 1 dimensional array with 1 element which is "null"
[16:27:27] <Guest97368> I really appreciate your help.
[16:27:37] <bepolite> np
[16:27:51] <Guest97368> Oh! that makes sense.
[16:28:33] <Guest97368> Geez.  Thank you, bepolite!
[16:29:21] <Sal> why aint this working: https://jsfiddle.net/4n8kmq0a/
[16:29:56] <Sal> its so stupid, maybe my eyes are not catching it
[16:30:06] <bepolite> Sal:  how did you expect it to work?
[16:30:48] <Sal> bepolite, what am i missing? let me feel stupid
[16:31:30] <Sal> i just want a 80% page height panel come up from bottom
[16:31:52] <Sal> the last change i did was to put 800px on height
[16:31:57] <Sal> but that should be 80%
[16:32:33] <Sal> but it seems that the js is not running at all
[16:35:02] <Sal> bepolite, did yous ee what i did wrong?
[16:35:21] <bepolite> For some reason, jquery isn't being loaded
[16:35:30] <bepolite> I'm trying to test on Jsbin
[16:37:45] <Sal> oh, thanks
[16:40:01] <bepolite> Sal: It works well on JSbin http://jsbin.com/qohofo/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[16:40:36] <bepolite> You can actually see the output here http://jsbin.com/qohofo/1/
[16:40:37] <Sal> looking
[16:41:01] <Sal> 1 thing, why aint it centering?
[16:41:09] <Sal> i put margin: auto;
[16:41:26] <bepolite> hahahha
[16:41:51] <bepolite> Not like I'm mocking at you
[16:42:52] <Sal> damn, also, the reverse effect is not applying
[16:42:53] <Sal> damn
[16:44:02] <bepolite> What is the reverse effect?
[16:44:13] <bepolite> Sal: As a side note, plase don't use  onclick="btnClick(this)"
[16:44:18] <bepolite> Use event listerners
[16:44:20] <Sal> lett the div go back down with transition
[16:44:25] <Sal> just like it came up
[16:44:35] <Sal> when i remove bottom: 0;
[16:44:46] <Sal> it shoudl get again bottom -850px
[16:44:56] <Sal> so it should transition down
[16:44:57] <Sal> no?
[16:46:35] <bepolite> Sal: do you undeerstand  what position: fixed; does?
[16:47:19] <Sal> yes, it should position the element on fixed axis on the view
[16:47:49] <bepolite> Yep and fixed axis is not the center
[16:48:03] <Sal> hehe
[16:48:18] <Sal> thats right, i should use another full width div container
[16:48:19] <Sal> ok
[16:48:42] <Sal> and what aboyt the down transition?
[16:48:49] <Sal> what am i doing wrong on that?
[16:48:59] <Sal> aboyt=about
[16:50:08] <bepolite> Sal:  http://jsbin.com/qohofo/2/ it is cenntralized now
[16:50:24] <Sal> yes, thats cool
[16:50:29] <Sal> and the return down?
[16:50:37] <Sal> thats the only piece missing
[16:50:38] <bepolite> This is the code http://jsbin.com/qohofo/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[16:57:27] <Sal> bepolite, thanks
[16:58:49] <bepolite> Sal: I'm not good with CSS transitions so I can't debug that for you.. Sory
[17:00:19] <Sal> no problem, i just saw thats its working
[17:00:39] <Sal> its bevause the gray background goes away fast that you don't see the panel go down
[17:00:49] <Sal> i added a border to it and i see it go down
[17:01:06] <Sal> i think i have to use jquery animate
[17:01:22] <Sal> i'l just hide the gray panel on animation end
[17:01:30] <Sal> thanks for the rest
[17:02:29] <DragonPunch> I'm waiting.

[19:08:49] <vivekananda> hi everyone
[19:09:36] <vivekananda> need a little help with a jquery autocoomplete I assembled a while back but am having trouble with changing parts. here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/28/ . why am I getting the 'undefined' in the console
[19:15:06] <rochadt> vivekananda: where do you define customMenuComplete?
[19:15:42] <vivekananda> line 82 ?
[19:18:08] <vivekananda> sorry I am a little confused I might be wrong. This is old code . should have written comments
[19:18:27] <vivekananda> I might be wrong is what I am saying
[20:22:15] <AlgorithmWizard> instead of $(“#elementId”) can i do $(actualElement) ?
[20:26:44] <timgws> Hey guys, I want to have items inside a container correctly follow the mouse when I use the 'zoom' CSS attribute on a sortable container.
[20:27:05] <timgws> I posted a question over at stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29596737/jquery-ui-draggable-correctly-having-the-mouse-follow-sortable-items-when-zoomi ... I was wondering if anyone here might be able to help me out?
[20:38:34] <spillere> any reason wht this wouldn't work on IE8? jQuery(".downloadpdflink").attr("href", pdf_url);
[20:40:09] <timgws> spillere, stupid question, is downloadpdflink the class on the a tag?
[20:40:21] <spillere> yes
[20:40:29] <spillere> <a class="downloadpdflink" id="pdflink" target="_blank" href=""><button type="button" id="download-button" style="display:none;" class="button downbutton">DOWNLOAD FILE</button></a>
[20:40:42] <spillere> just saw someone saying there's a problem if you have a button inside an <a>
[20:41:38] <timgws> spillere, you shouldn't need to use an <a> tag inside a <button>
[20:41:43] <spillere> yeah
[20:41:48] <spillere> im fixing that
[20:42:23] <timgws> spillere, check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/adardesign/5vHGc/
[20:42:35] <timgws> or this: http://jsfiddle.net/s86uq28u/
[20:43:22] <timgws> then you can just use $('button .downbutton').click( function() { /* ... */ });
[20:43:46] <spillere> ty
[20:44:33] <spillere> cant i add a href to a button?
[20:44:50] <igyiguygyu> Hey. What's a good library for adding classes based on screen size?
[20:45:46] <spillere> buess not
[20:46:10] <coderdecay> igyiguygyu just use css
[20:46:13] <timgws> spillere, no, you can't.
[20:46:16] <coderdecay> and media queries
[20:46:31] <spillere> maybe put <a> inside button?
[20:46:37] <timgws> spillere, no
[20:46:50] <timgws> spillere, but you can make a class (like "link") and then use $('button.link').click( function() { window.location = $(this).data('href') }
[20:46:56] <coderdecay> could just style an <a> to look like a button
[20:47:07] <spillere> that too
[20:47:21] <timgws> coderdecay, that was linked before :)
[20:47:28] <igyiguygyu> coderdecay: We'll I need to add a class only on small screen size. That class will initiate enable the ul to become collapsable
[20:47:54] <coderdecay> timgws, ahh just started paying attention :)
[20:48:50] <timgws> igyiguygyu, use $(window).on('resize', function() { }) and media queries
[20:49:07] <timgws> and/or, depending on what browsers you want/need to support
[20:49:43] <timgws> you can check if $(window).height() is a particular size and swap out classes inside <body>
[20:49:59] <timgws> check out http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/
[20:51:37] <spillere> timgws: before was a>button, not its button>a, it works on IE
[20:51:56] <timgws> spillere, if it's a link, why not use a link item, without the button?
[20:51:58] <spillere> next problem is that the link is like www.link.com/?i=123, and in IE it only passes www.link.com/ any walkaround?
[20:52:07] <spillere> timgws: i will style it later :)
[20:52:10] <timgws> spillere, I gave you the work around
[20:52:16] <timgws> and you can still style a link ;)
[20:52:31] <spillere> ahh
[20:52:32] <spillere> sweet
[20:52:36] <spillere> let me try
[20:52:42] <igyiguygyu> I know media queries, thanks. I'm just using a particular framework that has everything built based on classes and as soon the screen width enters the mobile space, I want to add a class that will make my regular UL a collapsible by adding class="collapsible"
[20:52:52] <igyiguygyu> But thanks! :)
[20:53:02] <timgws> check out http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons
[20:53:41] <spillere> like this? jQuery('.button downbutton').click( function() { window.location = pdf_url }
[20:53:44] <timgws> the first button is an "a" tag that has been styled with css
[20:53:47] <jqueryius> Hi - for something like <input type="file" name="photo1" /> - is it possible in jQuery to reset that individual input file?
[20:53:56] <jqueryius> There is no form, so a form reset is not an option
[20:54:05] <timgws> no, other way around... and no space :P button.downbutton
[20:54:21] <spillere> $('button .downbutton').click( function() { /* ... */ });
[20:54:28] <timgws> jQuery('button.downbutton').click( function() { window.location = pdf_url; });
[20:54:59] <timgws> yeah, I know, I accidentally typed the selector incorrectly, because the class is *on* the button, not *bellow* the button, you don't want that space.
[20:55:40] <spillere> <button type="button" id="download-button" style="display:none;" class="button downbutton">DOWNLOAD FILE</button>
[20:55:50] <spillere> makes sense!
[20:56:17] <timgws> ah :) I didn't know the button tag had the 'button' css class on it.
[20:56:21] <spillere> lol
[20:56:22] <spillere> sorry
[20:56:30] <timgws> that seems redundant - unless you have styling on the button class.
[20:56:34] <spillere> so jQuery('.button downbutton').click( function() { window.location = pdf_url; }); right
[20:56:36] <spillere> i do
[20:56:51] <timgws> spillere, you still want to do .button.downbutton, because the class is on the same object
[20:56:59] <spillere> ok
[20:57:05] <timgws> at the same time, button.downbutton will work too
[20:57:43] <timgws> and *might* be faster on some different browsers, because it's only targeting one type of tag, vs walking the DOM tree to find all tags that *might* have the classes button & downbutton
[21:13:15] <vivekananda> can someone tell me what is wrong with the 'seleted' part https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/xap12b2a/3/
[21:13:33] <vivekananda> selected part sorry
[21:25:01] <vivekananda> anyone around ?
[21:25:27] <timgws> no one at all
[21:27:14] <timgws> vivekananda, $('.auto_complete_cve').prev().children(':first').val() works
[21:27:59] <vivekananda> timgws, it does yes but I want to output the value that has been 'selected' and wont necessarily be the first element always.
[21:31:33] <vivekananda> timgws, got it :). https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/xap12b2a/4/
[22:27:20] <jqueryius> hello
[22:27:34] <jqueryius> I have a console.log inside a series of nested click events
[22:27:44] <jqueryius> The first time I click some button, i see the console.log message once
[22:27:50] <jqueryius> the second time I click it, I see it two times
[22:27:56] <jqueryius> the third time, I see it three times
[22:27:58] <jqueryius> and so on
[22:28:04] <jqueryius> what is this most likely a symptom of?
[22:28:13] <jqueryius> is it rebinding an event or something?
[22:29:40] <codedecay> tough to say without seeing it, are you sure your click event is firing on the same object each time
[22:35:46] <jqueryius> codedecay, yeah the event is firing
[22:35:57] <jqueryius> I'll see if I can post some of the code
[22:36:09] <jqueryius> Some of it is private so I can't include the lot, but the events I will include
[22:36:28] <codedecay> okay
[22:41:17] <jqueryius> codedecay: http://pastebin.com/zbYfFUqj
[22:41:49] <jqueryius> I've tried unbinding on $('#press-button').unbind('click', syncLogic).click(syncLogic);
[22:42:05] <jqueryius> My other feeling is maybe this bit is rebinding: database.allDocs({include_docs: true}).then(function(result) {   .... but i'm not sue how to unbind that
[22:42:41] <jqueryius> ie. On every click of $("#login-btn"), that database "then" function is rebinding therefore everything's happening multiple times
[22:46:56] <codedecay> ya well definitely getting bound multiple times because of the code, why not just add the binding to an outer element and leave it there
[22:47:01] <codedecay> so you don't have to manage the binding this way
[22:47:20] <jqueryius> how do you mean?
[22:47:55] <jqueryius> do you agree the multiple binding is on that database call? or do you see others?
[22:50:26] <codedecay> I can't really tell from your code, should be easy enough to debug with dev tools, and step through tell you see the second event handler
[22:50:45] <jqueryius> ok. what do you mean by "why not just add the binding to an outer element and leave it there"?
[22:52:39] <codedecay> now that I've looked at your code more I'm not sure that will work have you tried just using .off("click"), instead of specifying the generated function in your unbind?
[22:54:01] <vivekananda> I have a function which works fine. I am however trying to get the value of the element in line 8. What is the correct method to do this. ? that part doesn't work ie the value is empty. https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/vmds8ggd/
[22:56:47] <jqueryius> I haven't tried it
[22:56:49] <jqueryius> I will now
[22:57:23] <codedecay> assuming the child is an input, that will work if you get a singular element instead of an array
[22:57:53] <jqueryius> $('#press-button').off('click'); $('#press-button').click(syncLogic);           << like that?
[22:58:17] <codedecay> ya, since each time you are calling unbind your passing a different syncLogic, I don't think it was unbinding
[22:58:58] <codedecay> ya, off is pref over unbind
[22:58:58] <jqueryius> ah ok
[22:59:05] <jqueryius> so what happens the first time?
[22:59:15] <jqueryius> because $('#fs-sync-button').off('click'); is before the bind
[22:59:25] <jqueryius> does .off just do nothing if there is nothing already bound?
[22:59:33] <jqueryius> or should I reverse the order?
[22:59:40] <codedecay> nothing, it will look for a click event handler and find none
[22:59:45] <jqueryius> ok
[22:59:56] <jqueryius> will give it a crack :)
[22:59:57] <jqueryius> thanks
[23:00:57] <jqueryius> codedecay: thank you
[23:01:00] <jqueryius> that fixed it
[23:01:23] <codedecay> glad to hear!
[23:02:07] <vivekananda> anyone for my problem ?
[23:05:23] <Uhkis> vivekananda: children can (and will) return multiple matches, you most likely want to add a selector to it
[23:05:47] <codedecay> you just need to select the specific input element you want the val from vivekananda
[23:07:31] <vivekananda> Uhkis, yeah I guessed but even before that I want to know if line 8 is out
[23:07:47] <Uhkis> is out?
[23:09:22] <Cork> vivekananda: the worst thing with like 8 is that the variable is a global variable
[23:09:31] <Cork> vivekananda: its fine except for that
[23:09:44] <Uhkis> good morning Cork :-)
[23:09:56] <Cork> vivekananda: personally i would prob just move the .val call inside the data: object
[23:10:02] <Cork> Uhkis: morning
[23:10:30] <Cork> vivekananda: https://jsfiddle.net/vmds8ggd/1/
[23:10:49] <vivekananda> Uhkis, sorry i meant that line 8 does not conform with the way the ui widget is structured. If I understand correctly any code inside the ui widget needs to have only x: y pairs seperated by a comma. line 8 is not like that so I am not even sure if it will work
[23:11:14] <vivekananda> Cork, I am looking one sec
[23:11:51] <Cork> vivekananda: there isn't a "widget structure" like that
[23:12:20] <Cork> vivekananda: the callback for source is to allow the site developer to pull in other values or do special ajax "things"
[23:12:26] <Cork> so what you do is perfectly valid
[23:12:38] <Uhkis> vivekananda: it's inside your function so it doesn't matter (except for being global variable as Cork pointed out)
[23:13:19] <vivekananda> I was talking of the api documentation Cork -- http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ . What do those methods mean then if not for structural purposes ?
[23:13:44] <Cork> vivekananda: the structure there is for what autocomplete expects BACK
[23:14:01] <Cork> meaning what you give to response() need to be in that structure
[23:15:21] <Cork> well actually, it doesn't; but if you want to use the default handling of autocomplete to work you do
[23:15:43] <vivekananda> Cork, if you can, please look at my site itself ie localhost ( will set up a tunnel quickly) . I am getting an undefined for the value whichever ways I try it. gimme a sec
[23:15:59] <Cork> vivekananda: no, i can't look at your localhost :)
[23:16:08] <Cork> 127.x.x.x isn't routable
[23:16:12] <vivekananda> Cork, I will set up a tunnel hold on
[23:18:57] <vivekananda> Cork, https://2f5d79e.ngrok.com/test2/safeview/www/
[23:19:36] <Cork> and what do you want me to look at?
[23:20:24] <vivekananda> I have two issues related. 1 is that looking in the console on refreshing the page the line 233 of js/site.js shows undefined ( but that is expected) . 2. The line 236 is supposed to send the value of the chosen box next to the search box . that value is also not going through.
[23:20:34] <vivekananda> what am I doing wrong for these esp 2
[23:20:55] <vivekananda> I guess 1 is expected
[23:20:59] <vivekananda> 2 is my main issue
[23:21:23] <Cork> vivekananda: you're still using the globlal variable
[23:21:45] <vivekananda> Cork, could you tell me which one is the global so I can change it ?
[23:21:56] <vivekananda> oo got it
[23:22:11] <vivekananda> sorry one sec. you mean I have to do a var x rather than just x
[23:22:13] <vivekananda> right ?
[23:22:17] <Cork> ya, i recommend using "use strict"; at the top of you're js files
[23:22:25] <Cork> then things like that will be parser errors
[23:22:31] <vivekananda> ok got it
[23:22:35] <vivekananda> so I changed
[23:22:37] <vivekananda> please refresh
[23:22:57] <Cork> also you have a googleusercontent string at the beginning of your document
[23:23:04] <Cork> it causes the browser to go into quirk mode
[23:23:23] <Cork> you _REALLY_ want the doctype to be the first line in the html file
[23:24:14] <vivekananda> Cork, that was just me testing things. I just left it as is. That is the next thing I have to correct / work on after this issue
[23:25:48] <vivekananda> Cork, so a related question is , how can I know what $(this) currently is ? I guessed it would be the box with class = auto_complete_cve but it might not be that
[23:26:12] <Cork> vivekananda: i still don't know what this code relates to on the page
[23:26:14] <vivekananda> I was trying to make sure by giving some value='something' to that div and then output that value in console
[23:26:31] <Cork> and honestly it is too much digging, i don't have time
[23:26:43] <vivekananda> Cork, the code I referred to ( for jquery / js ) relates to the search box.
[23:27:07] <vivekananda> All it is supposed to do is to output values. if you want a working demo just look at this
[23:27:11] <vivekananda> www.safeview.com
[23:27:26] <vivekananda> just type mic in the box and wait for a sec
[23:27:26] <Cork> vivekananda: put a breakpoint in the source callback
[23:27:31] <Cork> and check what happens
[23:27:47] <Cork> then check the network tab to make sure you get the correct response from the server
[23:27:58] <Cork> and make sure you give the value correctly to response()
[23:28:58] <vivekananda> the network tab tells me I am not sending the type_id at all on the "POST"ed page. so somehow there is no value going through. If I use a dummy value for the type_ID it goes fine
[23:29:45] <vivekananda> all I want is the selected box's 'value' to go through. The box here is the dropdown box on the webpage ( there is just one dropdown box)
[23:32:15] <vivekananda> I guess you would be busy :(. I will keep checking . if you want I can let the tunnel up or take it down
[23:33:01] <Cork> vivekananda: so the selector you use isn't finding the element you want
[23:33:18] <Cork> though as $(this) will be the input element that is expected
[23:34:17] <vivekananda> Cork, yes. I am trying to find any element so I can traverse up or down to the correct one. that is why I put value="" for all elements above an below like 2 levels
[23:34:47] <Cork> vivekananda: could you create a jsfiddle with the html structure you need to traverse?
[23:34:53] <dunkel2> hello
[23:35:08] <vivekananda> yes I did and used it too. it works in the html dumb thing !!!
[23:35:12] <vivekananda> here take a look
[23:35:20] <dunkel2> have you guys used snap svg?
[23:35:41] <vivekananda> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/xap12b2a/4/
[23:35:50] <vivekananda> I hope the structure is the same
[23:36:00] <vivekananda> I will need to copy paste again if it isnt
[23:36:16] <vivekananda> you can see the html though ( on the tunnel )
[23:36:30] <Cork> vivekananda: but that is keyup, not autocomplete source
[23:39:49] <vivekananda> Cork, yeah but I was trying to just get to the element I wanted to on doing a keyup. My source code also is doing a similar thing ( look at lines 257 and 258 ) for site.js
[23:40:11] <Cork> vivekananda: the function calling the callback controls what this is
[23:40:22] <Cork> so you can't just substitute source with keyup
[23:41:19] <vivekananda> Cork, I understand but I am just tyring to get to the dropdown chosen element. How else would you like me to isolate that issue and create a fiddle ? I thought this live working thing would be the easiest to look at
[23:41:55] <vivekananda> I will have to create too many elements and data to replicate the entire thing
[23:42:20] <Cork> vivekananda: well i would recommend using $('#cve_search select')
[23:44:26] <vivekananda> Cork, so u mean since cve_search is a fixed element hence using that should guarantee me getting a value ?
[23:44:58] <vivekananda> Cork, that can be a temp workaround but I will be in trouble later if I used two search boxes ( see the add searchbox button ? ) :)
[23:45:05] <Cork> vivekananda: i would have used $(this).closest('the-parent') normally, but as that is an id so it is guaranteed to be page unique
[23:45:17] <Cork> then ya $() is a much simpler selector
[23:46:14] <Cork> vivekananda: then you should give the div a class and use that
[23:46:31] <Cork> vivekananda: btw name and action isn't valid on <div>
[23:46:45] <vivekananda> yeah so I am stuck. I gave it a value !!! . wouldn't a value be much more specific to get to ?
[23:47:08] <Cork> specific to get to?
[23:47:11] <Cork> what do you mean?
[23:47:23] <vivekananda> Cork, if you are talking  about the fiddle , it was giving me errors so I just did a temp workaround for it
[23:47:39] <Cork> <div name="cve_search" id="cve_search" action=""> <-- this isn't valid
[23:48:43] <vivekananda> Cork, that is only on the fiddle but is not an error on the actual page
[23:48:50] <Cork> vivekananda: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2F2f5d79e.ngrok.com%2Ftest2%2Fsafeview%2Fwww%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=HTML5&group=0
[23:48:56] <Cork> you have some work to do :)
[23:49:30] <vivekananda> yeah I know. But I will go around polishing once I have this basic thing working :( .
[23:49:38] <vivekananda> thanks for that link though I will save it
[23:49:40] <Cork> vivekananda: that isn't polish
[23:49:45] <Uhkis> valid html is the basic thing..
[23:49:48] <Cork> vivekananda: this is the first thing you should fix
[23:50:10] <vivekananda> I know but can I please get to the problem right after this one ?
[23:50:21] <Cork> coding on a dom you can't trust is like trying to build a house before you've layed out the fundation
[23:50:31] <Uhkis> yes, you can get to your js problem after fixing the html ;)
[23:50:42] <Cork> vivekananda: your problem might actually come from the quirk mode + broken html
[23:50:47] <Cork> so ya, fix that first
[23:51:17] <Cork> vivekananda: you're trying to traverse a dom you don't know what it looks like
[23:51:30] <Cork> as the browser will fiddle around with it trying to handle all the errors
[23:51:35] <Cork> and.. quirk mode
[23:51:47] <Cork> quirk mode is BAD
[23:52:03] <vivekananda> Cork, I have spent like a whole day or more on this so I would rather finish this than come back and loose track of everythng and begin from scratch :( .
[23:52:10] <vivekananda> What is the quirk mode you are talking about ?
[23:52:29] <Cork> vivekananda: if the first line in the document isn't <!doctype> the browser goes into legacy mode
[23:52:42] <Cork> and handles the page in a pre 1998 legacy mode
[23:52:52] <Cork> you don't want to be in that legacy mode, trust me
[23:52:55] <luaboy> how to dump a json string in html ?
[23:53:04] <Cork> luaboy: JSON.stringify
[23:53:20] <vivekananda> Cork, there are 192 errors. you would ask me to fix those first than debug this ?
[23:53:23] <Cork> if you actually mean object/array and not json
[23:53:41] <Cork> luaboy: if you actually mean json, it's just a string so just put it in an element
[23:53:51] <Uhkis> vivekananda: >50 of those are just improper comments, it's not that hard to fix
[23:53:53] <Cork> vivekananda: yes
[23:54:26] <vivekananda> well okay lemme see then but I am sure once I fix those and come back I will have to begin doing this again from scratch
[23:54:59] <vivekananda> I hate putting 2 days in something and then have to trash everything to begin something new but I guess you have a valid point
[23:55:08] <Cork> vivekananda: tip, ppl will not want to plow down time into a problem that has a high chance of coming from quirk mode
[23:55:11] <Cork> or just broken html
[23:55:23] <vivekananda> Cork, yeah I get that.
[23:55:23] <Cork> so ppl on irc WILL demand that you fix those first
[23:55:30] <Cork> it is common rule
[23:55:34] <vivekananda> yeah I guess you are right
[23:55:40] <vivekananda> lemme look at those first then
[23:58:19] <Cork> some channels even have an auto check for w3c validator (a bot) and if the link doesn't pass with 0 errors and warnings the question is ignored
[23:58:40] <Cork> i find that to be a bit to harsh, but it gives an interesting reference to how ppl look at this
