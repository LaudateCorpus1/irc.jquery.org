[10:44:18] <Es0teric> sup everybody, I have a question -- If i have multiple checkboxes but when I click on a checkbox and its checked, then click on another and it unchecks the first checkbox i checked plus it does not check the current checkbox that I clicked on, what could be causing the unchecking of the checkbox?
[10:44:38] <Es0teric> what would I have to look for:?
[11:07:48] <Es0teric> anybody?
[11:08:07] <robertmaxrees> must've missed your question.
[11:08:09] <robertmaxrees> lemme check the logs.
[11:08:34] <robertmaxrees> you would look for an event listener on 'change'
[11:08:52] <robertmaxrees> also double check to make sure you're not using radios :)
[11:09:36] <Es0teric> well i have an event listener on 'click'
[11:09:38] <Es0teric> would that also matter?
[11:09:47] <robertmaxrees> it definitely could.
[11:10:02] <Es0teric> or could on change and on click be colliding?
[11:10:24] <robertmaxrees> dunno about "colliding", but yeah you could have multiples of either/both
[11:11:27] <Es0teric> because at first i thought it was that maybe there was a div missing on the wrap for the checkbox
[11:11:30] <Es0teric> but the html is fine
[11:11:37] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:11:48] <robertmaxrees> wrapping elements really shouldn't matter.
[11:11:52] <Es0teric> i see
[11:12:10] <robertmaxrees> unless the bindings rely on them or something.
[11:12:44] <robertmaxrees> you can use your dev tools to see what listeners are bound to elements.
[11:18:30] <Es0teric> where in my dev tools would that be/
[11:18:32] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[11:18:41] <robertmaxrees> you using chrome or firefox?
[11:18:57] <Es0teric> chrome
[11:19:21] <robertmaxrees> go to the "elements" tab and look at the right-hand sidebar - the one that says "event listeners" :)
[11:19:37] <robertmaxrees> just select the element you want to see handlers for and then look at that tab.
[11:20:34] <Es0teric> wait i dont get it
[11:20:42] <Es0teric> when i click on the element it will tell me what listener it has?
[11:20:52] <robertmaxrees> listeners, yeah.
[11:21:14] <Es0teric> i dont see that changing
[11:21:16] <Es0teric> the side
[11:21:24] <robertmaxrees> because the events they can emit don't really change :)
[11:21:33] <robertmaxrees> expand the "click" group, for instance.
[11:21:41] <robertmaxrees> you're gonna have to do SOME digging.
[11:22:06] <robertmaxrees> it also shows all delegated handlers, so you might have a ton of other stuff in there.
[11:24:19] <Es0teric> what about firefox?
[11:24:23] <Es0teric> is it easier in that?
[11:25:02] <robertmaxrees> that shows you in the inspector tab with a little "event" tag next to the elements that have bound handlers.
[11:25:07] <robertmaxrees> similar experience.
[11:25:37] <robertmaxrees> though delegated handlers only show on the root element they're bound to, not the child elements they're for, if memory serves.
[11:25:54] <robertmaxrees> whichever tool you use is gonna take some work.
[11:27:33] <Es0teric> hmmm
[11:27:36] <Es0teric> man...
[11:27:43] <robertmaxrees> did you need some help?
[11:27:47] <Es0teric> this one is difficult because it seems that its not using the standard checkbox
[11:27:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[11:27:57] <Es0teric> i mean the standard checkbox is there but this is styled different
[11:28:09] <Es0teric> its using a .box div with a .fa-check icon in th emiddle
[11:28:10] <robertmaxrees> is the markup for a checkbox or something else?
[11:28:11] <Es0teric> *the middle
[11:28:22] <robertmaxrees> is the page publically available?
[11:28:23] <Es0teric> something like that.. it has the checkbox input in it
[11:28:24] <Es0teric> no
[11:28:32] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code in a fiddle?
[11:28:35] <Es0teric> i am not allowed to share the code due to company policy
[11:28:48] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[11:28:49] <Es0teric> jsfiddle, pastebin, kopy.io
[11:28:52] <Es0teric> they are all blocked
[11:28:53] <Es0teric> in the network
[11:28:58] <robertmaxrees> can't troubleshoot what we can't see :/
[11:29:02] <Es0teric> yeah
[11:29:12] <Es0teric> ill brb though
[11:49:27] <taplar> Es0teric what about github, is that blocked?  if not you could make a gist
[12:07:29] <robertmaxrees> not even noon and i want a nap.
[12:07:48] <taplar> i feel like that driving in to work every day
[12:20:40] <taplar> la manana ciesta muy bueno
[13:06:53] <poboy> What I'm wanting to do, is replace the "Follow Up" column on whichever row is selected with a variable I will pass in.  https://jsfiddle.net/4fhj9eLg/1/
[13:06:59] <poboy> Do I need to remove this td then rebuild?
[13:07:41] <taplar> text(newValue)
[13:08:29] <poboy> derp.  thanks
[14:30:14] <taplar> that's where I got referred to when I got rejected from my federal job attempt.
[14:33:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:33:38] <taplar> derpa
[14:33:59] <robertmaxrees> "derpa"?
[14:34:07] <taplar> play on darpa
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> oh
[14:34:22] <robertmaxrees> heh i'm out of it today.
[14:34:29] <taplar> it wasn't that good either
[17:05:34] <ekiro> do you need to use 'var' to declare vars? i sometimes dont see ppl use it
[17:05:45] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:06:07] <robertmaxrees> unless your transpiling from es2015+, in which case you should use let and const
[17:06:16] <robertmaxrees> but always declare
[17:07:08] <robertmaxrees> in fact, it's technically invalid to not.
[17:17:06] <ekiro> does the same apply to constants?
[17:17:26] <robertmaxrees> you mean let and const?
[17:17:27] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:17:31] <robertmaxrees> always declare.
[17:17:38] <robertmaxrees> favor let and const these days.
[17:20:26] <ekiro> interesting
[17:20:42] <ekiro> when i use var/const/let on this line: setTimeoutConst = setTimeout(function() { it breaks the script
[17:20:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what all you're doing.
[17:21:05] <robertmaxrees> you're likely declaring it in one scope and then trying to access it in another.
[17:21:19] <ekiro> https://bpaste.net/show/2a41a67856a4
[17:21:26] <ekiro> ah yeah
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:21:37] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't do that :)
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> you also don't want to omit the declaration.
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea, too.
[17:23:28] <ekiro> where would i place the setTimeoutConst ?
[17:23:37] <ekiro> outside of template.hover() ?
[17:23:37] <robertmaxrees> you can't use it as a const there.
[17:24:21] <robertmaxrees> would need to be let setTimeout before the template.hover
[18:48:00] <ekiro> can you add additional functionality to a plugin's function without modding the source code?
[18:58:20] <pavonia> ekiro: You can redfine the function to another function that is just a wrapper around the other, but with a hook before or after the original function call
[18:58:57] <pavonia> Hooking into the original function is only possible if the function already provides some features for this
[19:11:10] <beshoo> i am searching for animation google use to use in any app. when you open the app. it create animation to focus to the right corner button , and show other area with different collor - amd not sure if i describe my self correctly
[19:11:55] <ekiro> Could someone please help me with this. I've spent two days on something simple I can't figure out. basically I want to revert back a click event if the user made no change after clicking it. If the user does not click on a item in the autocomplete but clicks on something else on the page, i want the input field to be replaced with the .file-show-title span.  Here is my code: https://bpaste.net/show/0bc707831b4b
[19:22:01] <beshoo> any idea about this kind of animation
