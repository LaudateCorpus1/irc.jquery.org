[03:59:02] <jak2000> hi all
[04:05:42] <jak2017> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/34195cad/1/   why not hidde the button..... when user click on Btn1 ?
[04:08:36] <jak2017> Cork?
[04:12:43] <Cork> jak2017: this isn't a jquery object
[04:12:47] <Cork> you need to use $()
[04:13:03] <jak2000> Cork hi friend are you sleep?
[04:13:17] <Cork> no, just away from the computer
[04:13:32] <Cork> its 09:13 so why would i sleep >_>
[04:14:46] <jak2000> here 1:14am
[04:14:57] <jak2000> strange in the fiddle work but in my production code not
[04:14:59] <jak2000> :(
[04:17:34] <jak2000> Cork: http://pastebin.com/EC2PkXqV
[04:17:42] <jak2000> see line 2? work
[04:17:59] <jak2000> but if remove the line 2.. not work the line 16...
[04:18:19] <Cork> line 16 won't work
[04:18:24] <jak2000> why?
[04:18:27] <Cork> done has its own function
[04:18:31] <Cork> so this isn't the same value
[04:18:40] <jak2000> ahh understand
[04:18:42] <Cork> use var self = this; and $(self) in the .done callback
[04:18:44] <jak2000> then how to fix it?
[04:18:48] <jak2000> ok
[04:18:59] <Cork> note var self = this; needs to be on line 2
[04:19:11] <Cork> (or similar position)
[04:19:17] <jak2000> :)
[04:20:39] <Cork> jak2000: also you don't need to ahve "" around keys in the data object
[04:20:53] <Cork> its only json that requires that, not javascript
[04:21:17] <Moondhum> Hello, please help me with simpleexpand() https://jsfiddle.net/t1eubrd2/2/
[04:21:34] <jak2000> cork wich line?
[04:21:45] <Cork> jak2000: data: {}
[04:21:58] <Cork> data: { xAction: '' ... }
[04:22:08] <jak2000> ok
[04:22:10] <Cork> well "xAction" is valid too, just not needed
[04:22:18] <Cork> and normally not used in js
[04:22:19] <jak2000> other question
[04:22:37] <Cork> Moondhum: you need to ask what a question for ppl to be able to help you
[04:22:54] <jak2000> i have a html table....and in a cell have a button, that hide, when clicked
[04:22:57] <jak2000> you see? right?
[04:23:04] <Cork> yup
[04:23:06] <jak2000> in this cell how to replace with a value? text?
[04:23:26] <Cork> i would prob do that through css
[04:25:15] <Moondhum> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/t1eubrd2/5/ This script is not working as it was supposed to. I need help with finding where it went wrong.
[04:26:30] <Cork> jak2000: http://jsfiddle.net/34195cad/8/
[04:26:49] <Cork> jak2000: btw why are you using such an old version of jquery?
[04:26:49] <Rockwood> hi konrados
[04:27:45] <Cork> Moondhum: 1. jquery isn't loaded, 2. the plugin providing simpleexpand isn't loaded
[04:28:27] <Moondhum> Cork: ok thanks
[04:30:46] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/34195cad/14/  <--- Cork i need add the value in the cell with jQuery
[04:30:55] <jak2000> why old version of Jquery?
[04:31:40] <Cork> jak2000: 1.7, 1.13.4 is the current 1.x version
[04:32:00] <Cork> ops typo, 1.12.4
[04:32:44] <jak2000> and how to know my version :)
[04:32:59] <Cork> jak2000: its in the javascript dropdown
[04:33:06] <Cork> 1.7.2
[04:33:06] <jak2000> ahh fiddle
[04:33:32] <Cork> jak2000: what text do you want to replace the button with?
[04:33:36] <jak2000> 3,2,1 right
[04:33:40] <jak2000> with the actual date
[04:33:47] <Cork> well if you want old ie support you can stick with 1.x
[04:34:02] <Cork> you mean "today"?
[04:34:05] <jak2000> yes
[04:34:23] <jak2000> $(self).hide();            var myDate=moment().format('YYYY/MM/DD');
[04:34:25] <jak2000> something
[04:34:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/34195cad/15/
[04:37:43] <jak2000> done...
[04:37:44] <jak2000>  $(self).closest('td').text(myDate);
[04:38:27] <jak2000> arghh need center the result sam as: <td ALIGN='RIGHT'> myDate </td>
[04:38:50] <Cork> ... align has been deprecated for ages
[04:39:02] <jak2000> i use in this moment
[04:39:06] <jak2000> old thing right?
[04:39:16] <Cork> ya, old as in pre css
[04:39:25] <Cork> use text-align
[04:39:38] <jak2000> with css?
[04:39:42] <Cork> yes
[04:39:50] <jak2000> ok
[04:39:59] <Cork> i would recommend setting it as a class in your css file and just add the class to the td
[04:40:06] <jak2000> ok.
[04:40:21] <Cork> you normally want to keep styling in the css, makes things much easier to maintain
[04:41:01] <jak2000> need other thing more
[04:41:14] <jak2000> wait writting a fiddle (same)
[04:42:12] <jak2000> see: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/34195cad/16/ click please on 'Btn1'.... hide and display actual date(today) right/
[04:42:24] <jak2000> my question is how to enable next button: Btn2 how to?
[04:42:59] <Cork> have them disabled by default and select them and use .prop('disabled', false=
[04:43:01] <Cork> *)
[04:43:25] <jak2000> yes but need do a closest?
[04:43:34] <Cork> ya
[04:43:45] <Cork> .closest('td').next().find('button')
[04:45:08] <jak2000> $(this).closest('td').next().find('button').prop('disabled',false);
[04:45:10] <jak2000> not work
[04:45:32] <Cork> well you click handler only listens for the btn1 class
[04:45:39] <Cork> if that's what you mean
[04:48:48] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/34195cad/20/   too not... :(
[04:49:14] <Cork> ..
[04:49:26] <Cork> you need to run .find on something -_-'
[04:51:53] <jak2000> $(this)  not
[04:52:00] <jak2000> wRenglon not
[04:52:01] <jak2000> :(
[04:52:11] <Cork> who would you find btn2 inside btn1?
[04:52:18] <Cork> try to think a little -_-'
[04:52:26] <jak2000> wRenglon.find(".btn2").find('button').prop('disabled',false);
[04:52:33] <jak2000> would be here
[04:52:44] <Cork> read what you're selecting and think
[04:52:45] <jak2000> thinking :)
[04:53:00] <Cork> you have one find too many
[04:53:22] <jak2000> done
[04:53:22] <jak2000> wRenglon.find(".btn2").prop('disabled',false);
[04:53:30] <jak2000> i am ok right?
[04:54:27] <Cork> try it
[04:54:35] <jak2000> :)
[04:54:43] <jak2000> good teacher
[06:10:48] <sonu_nk> is there any tool which can generate https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/3.5.1/animate.min.css css in json file ?
[06:11:24] <Cork> why would you want css as json??
[06:14:03] <sonu_nk>  yes.. issue is this :  i dont want to load whole animation.css on client side..i want to convert it in json then i will  parse specific animation class which i require and then will place it in css file.. with this i will only place 10  lines which i require for animation insted of 1000 lines..
[06:14:59] <Cork> generating stylesheets/modifying stylesheets on the fly is slow
[06:15:02] <Cork> just so you know
[06:15:12] <Cork> as it forces the browser to rerender then entire page every time
[06:15:41] <Cork> the best option would be to just split the css file into separate resources
[06:15:46] <Cork> and just load them when needed
[06:16:22] <Cork> (still with the warning i just gave you)
[06:16:52] <sonu_nk> Cork, if it converts in json then i will store it in database then i wiill choose one animation class suppose i select  ' bounce ".. then from json i will only parse the node which have  "bounce." and after this i will place it in css  file.. not i have only 10 lines and all rest classes are not included ...
[06:17:20] <burzum> hi
[06:18:37] <burzum> http://pastebin.com/NJxrsX9A the elements im trying to access in line 6 to 10 are added later by an ajax call that returns markup and is inserted into the DOM. how can I get them to be recognized inside my inputLanguageToggle() function?
[06:18:50] <Cork> sonu_nk: in database??
[06:18:55] <Cork> as in localStorage?
[06:19:42] <sonu_nk> in database..before deliver to client side i will genearate css file on server..
[06:20:23] <Cork> sonu_nk: well if you want to store your css in database you are free to, though it isn't normally a good idea
[06:20:38] <Cork> sonu_nk: i don't know of any tool that does that kind of convertion
[06:20:47] <Cork> not ever fully sure if json can store css syntax
[06:20:49] <sonu_nk> Cork, ok thank you
[06:21:05] <Cork> specially with @meta and the upcomming @if and @else syntaxes
[06:21:09] <Cork> uh
[06:21:19] <Cork> @meta == @media
[06:22:23] <Cork> burzum: if you want to run .show/.hide on the i recommend using css classes instead
[06:22:38] <Cork> burzum: then you can control them by setting the class on a parent element
[06:22:52] <Cork> burzum: if you absolutely have to do it in js, the answer is: you can't
[06:23:05] <Cork> burzum: the selector has to be ran again when the element has been added (every time)
[06:26:37] <burzum> Cork im OK with changing it to a class and I just changed the code to call inputLanguageToggle() after the ajax call and other things that require it.
[06:26:57] <burzum> Looks like this works but my problem is now something else :) However, thank you!
[06:27:16] <Cork> burzum: the recommendation was NOT to run the function multiple times
[06:27:25] <Cork> but to let css handler the job instead of through js
[06:50:09] <Ice_Strike2> I like to add ajax loading icon in a <button>
[06:50:19] <Ice_Strike2> First it has "Save" text
[06:50:31] <Ice_Strike2> When user click on Save button, it will replace to loading icon
[06:50:38] <Ice_Strike2> but the with of the button become smaller
[06:50:55] <Ice_Strike2> I would like the width of the button to be the same after replacing to ajax
[06:50:57] <Ice_Strike2> How to do that?
[06:51:18] <Cork> either set a fixed width on the button, or set the text to transparent
[06:51:27] <Cork> and absolute position the throbber in the button
[06:51:40] <Cork> then the icon won't affect the size of the button
[06:52:14] <Ice_Strike2> How about get a button width side via js and fixed the width and replace to ajax loader?
[06:52:33] <Cork> possible
[06:54:56] <Ice_Strike2> Im gonna try that
[06:55:10] <Ice_Strike2> That would be better I think because width of button could be anything.
[06:55:30] <Cork> ya, the recommendation is to just make the throbber position: absolute
[06:55:34] <Cork> and "hide" the text
[06:55:44] <Cork> then you don't need js to mock around with the element at all
[06:56:25] <Ice_Strike2> I am not familar with position: absolute
[06:56:35] <Cork> give me a min to create an example
[06:56:39] <Ice_Strike2> Thanks
[07:05:10] <Cork> Ice_Strike2: https://jsfiddle.net/w0xmwswg/
[07:08:18] <Ice_Strike2> Cork Very cool! Thank you.
[07:08:41] <Cork> Ice_Strike2: here's a version with animation https://jsfiddle.net/w0xmwswg/1/
[07:09:05] <Cork> had to add an extra element cause awsomefont mocks around with the position of <i> when it animates
[07:09:32] <Ice_Strike2> Really sexy
[07:09:33] <Ice_Strike2> Thanks! :)
[07:50:56] <Ice_Strike2> Cork Can you figure out what I did wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/w0xmwswg/1/
[07:51:20] <Ice_Strike2> Button disabled by default, when user type something and click on the button - it will show icon
[07:52:43] <Ice_Strike2> I think I have done it, https://jsfiddle.net/w0xmwswg/2/
[08:30:52] <Cork> Ice_Strike2: yup, the :disabled was just a simple way to do it
[08:38:32] <KlausedSource> can someone explain to me, why this doesnt work?
[08:38:33] <KlausedSource> https://bpaste.net/show/87135f47392a
[08:38:45] <KlausedSource> i want to create this button with jquery obviously
[08:39:14] <Cork> KlausedSource: you need to append it to the page
[08:39:26] <Cork> also don't use click: add an event listener
[08:39:56] <Cork> (also please use jsfiddle.net if you have more questions)
[08:40:19] <KlausedSource> Cork, can you give me a working example?
[08:40:30] <KlausedSource> i don't really get what you mean by "append it to the page"
[08:40:31] <Cork> if you had used jsfiddle yes
[08:42:17] <KlausedSource> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/tkmwbe7k/
[08:44:16] <Cork> KlausedSource: https://jsfiddle.net/tkmwbe7k/1/
[08:45:35] <KlausedSource> Cork, this doesn't do what i want unfortunetly. but i understand what you wrote before now.
[08:45:40] <KlausedSource> I want to create a button frmo "nothing"
[08:45:45] <KlausedSource> from*
[08:46:03] <Cork> KlausedSource: you are
[08:46:32] <Cork> but you have to have something to trigger the click from
[08:46:42] <Cork> and you also need to have an element to reference where to add the button
[08:46:48] <Cork> i picked a button for this
[08:46:49] <MikeD_> you know why this code doesn't work?  no comments
[08:47:44] <KlausedSource> Cork, ahh okay. i just realized the #myButton is only the anchor where you put the button
[08:48:10] <Cork> not really anchor, but ya basically
[08:48:37] <KlausedSource> i just understood that i only created a button in the nether before :)
[08:48:58] <Cork> well you created it, and then the gc removed it
[08:49:02] <Cork> as nothing referenced it
[08:50:39] <MikeD_> why is $('<button/>', { text: 'Test'}) better than $('<button>Test</button>')  ?
[08:51:09] <Cork> MikeD_: the later risks having xss injection if the text isn't static
[08:51:20] <Cork> and it becomes messy if you ever want to use a variable for the text
[08:51:40] <MikeD_> hmm... understood.
[08:52:14] <KlausedSource> Cork, so you triggered the creation with clicking on #myButton. But it would also be possible to trigger on $(document).ready(function() {}) right?
[08:52:33] <KlausedSource> like lets say i have 15 divs each with same class but unique id
[08:52:47] <Cork> MikeD_: baiscally $('<button>Text</button>') equals $('<button>').html('Test') while $('<button>', { text: 'Test' }) equals $('<button>').text('Test')
[08:52:52] <KlausedSource> and on document ready i want to create a button in each of those unique divs
[08:53:08] <Cork> KlausedSource: sure, only difference is you would have to find where to add it
[08:53:16] <Cork> instead of $(this)
[08:53:33] <Cork> KlausedSource: i would recommend to use classes there
[08:53:39] <Cork> and prob delegated event handlers
[08:53:46] <MikeD_> Cork++ for the extra detail :)
[09:08:26] <codecutter> how do i remove the part with parenthesis inside the tooltip (18 million) etc? https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/area-stacked-percent/
[09:08:31] <KlausedSource> Cork, ye exactly thats what i did now. https://jsfiddle.net/tkmwbe7k/5/ it's not finished but thx for your help now i know how to do it
[09:09:03] <KlausedSource> i'll make a loop now that creates a button for every #item-x
[09:10:21] <KlausedSource> and after clicking they will highlight the li.right and display the the .icon after each answer
[09:10:44] <Cork> KlausedSource: no, again use a class
[09:11:14] <Cork> don't select groups with ids
[09:11:24] <Cork> that's what classes are fore
[09:11:26] <Cork> *for
[09:15:23] <KlausedSource> Cork, i don't select a group with id oO
[09:15:29] <KlausedSource> i want to loop over them
[09:15:52] <Cork> KlausedSource: if you have a group of elements you want to do the same action on (add a button related to them)
[09:15:59] <Cork> you should select them by class
[09:16:03] <Cork> not a bunch of ids
[09:16:46] <Cork> if you ever need to put a number in an id you are most likely doing it wrong
[09:17:10] <KlausedSource> well you have seen my structure in the fiddle i linked
[09:17:15] <KlausedSource> what would you change?
[09:17:28] <KlausedSource> https://jsfiddle.net/tkmwbe7k/5/
[09:19:57] <Cork> KlausedSource: https://jsfiddle.net/tkmwbe7k/6/
[09:20:41] <Cork> KlausedSource: btw your &nbsp; is missing there ;
[09:20:44] <codecutter> anyone?
[09:20:46] <codecutter> how do i remove the part with parenthesis inside the tooltip (18 million) etc? https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/area-stacked-percent/
[09:21:05] <KlausedSource> Cork, well they wouldn't have the same function. that's why i wanted to select them by id
[09:21:34] <Cork> KlausedSource: except that means you have to run multiple selectors to do the same job
[09:22:14] <Cork> or have a repeating selector $('#item-1, #item-2, #item-3, #item-4, #item-4, #item-5, #item-6, #item-7')
[09:22:25] <Cork> neither is readable
[09:22:51] <Cork> also note that i moved the click handler to the .items element
[09:23:02] <Cork> so it doesn't have to be repeated for each button
[09:24:03] <codecutter> nvm
[09:31:09] <KlausedSource> Cork, this is how i wanted to do it: https://jsfiddle.net/tkmwbe7k/11/
[09:31:16] <KlausedSource> ...except it doesn't work :S
[09:32:29] <KlausedSource> of course the icons won't appear because they are not accessible, but i expected the css changes to work
[09:40:16] <KlausedSource> Cork, im stupid...
[09:40:45] <KlausedSource> Cork, i created the same button 15 times, i need to give them IDs, so they are not the same
[09:40:46] * MagnusVortex gently pats KlausedSource
[09:59:43] <codecutter> how do i show the pointers (those sqaure, diamond, circle dots) only on hover? https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/area-stacked-percent/
[10:00:40] <MikeD_> "Cork: if you ever need to put a number in an id you are most likely doing it wrong"  <-- advice worth quoting
[10:00:41] <MassDebates> you'd do that with the hover classes put in by the script
[10:00:57] <codecutter> cab i see how you do it?
[10:01:00] <codecutter> can*
[10:01:09] <MassDebates> Inspect the highcharts container element (or one fo the dots specifically)
[10:01:18] <MassDebates> Then hover and 'unhover' (mouse-off) the chart
[10:01:22] <MassDebates> you'll see the respective class animations
[10:01:42] <MassDebates> high charts is very easy to customize. It's a pretty cool thing about the script that makes up for some of its... _other_ problems
[10:05:28] <MassDebates> Just a glance at it, for example, shows me highcharts-point and highcharts-point-hover are two classes that are use
[10:05:28] <MassDebates> used
[10:05:44] <MassDebates> I would give those the respective display/opacity/visibility/fallback styles
[10:05:47] <codecutter> MassDebates: is there away to neatly present the dates across x-axis. It seems cluttered when you have a more than just a few data points. I notice in some charts that there is only a 2 or more dates in some charts
[10:05:52] <MassDebates> @ codecutter
[10:06:00] <MassDebates> hm looking now
[10:06:46] <MassDebates> Dates look neatly presented and it's more than just 2 or 3 data point sets.
[10:06:46] <MassDebates> Not sure what you're referring to, exactly
[10:07:18] <MassDebates> but if you have troubles with typography, sizing, layout, and space, you may want to reconsider your approach to the chart's positioning, orientation, and even form.
[11:15:05] <MassDebates> Can anyone help me? I'm making a script in an exercise that I'm doing for myself. I think it'll be hilariously fun to make
[11:15:55] <MassDebates> Not sure if jquery will be useful to leverage here, but I'm trying to think of a way to detect and replace specific syllables based upon how they're phonetically pronounced.
[11:17:48] <MassDebates> For example, I can say "Freedom" and I can say "Elephant" - They share a phonetic syllable, but it's spelled differently AND it's in a different location
[11:18:26] <MassDebates> I thought about a couple ways of going about this: one is loading up a dictionary of sorts that will act as a safety (with both negatives and positives for the matching) and then just run a regex. The dictionary can handle the exceptions that wouldn't apply and then I can run a general swap out
[11:18:51] <MassDebates> Is this a poor way to go about it? Also, I'd prefer to not use a lib that does this, and I'd prefer to keep it a lighter script
[11:44:30] <Es0teric> anybody here?
[11:44:56] <MassDebates> Es0teric:  hello
[11:45:38] <Es0teric> question -- if im on a click handler
[11:46:09] <Es0teric> but i am using $this context, how do i reference the current div being clicked on? right now i have a problem where since its multiple divs with the same class, all those divs are affected
[11:46:55] <z1haze_work> event.target
[11:47:17] <MassDebates> You can do it a couple different ways. If you're just using event.target it'll be simpler than using a selector
[11:47:23] <Es0teric> z1haze_work thats not what it is
[11:47:26] <Es0teric> not in this context
[11:47:34] <MassDebates> yeah what z1haze_work said
[11:47:38] <z1haze_work> you said the div being clicked on?
[11:48:19] <Es0teric|work> z1haze_work yeah but thats not what is being referenced here
[11:48:39] <z1haze_work> can you show some code, make a fiddle
[11:48:55] <Es0teric|work> z1haze_work https://jsfiddle.net/5w9Lrh54/
[11:49:17] <z1haze_work> jesus
[11:49:24] <Es0teric|work> line 38
[11:49:26] <Es0teric|work> on the js
[11:49:59] <MassDebates> I'm not the best with javascript
[11:50:07] <MassDebates> But I don't think this is the best way to do things
[11:50:26] <z1haze_work> Es0teric|work: you could use arrow functions and then this would be the context that you want it to be
[11:50:37] <taplar> didn't we mention this yesterday?  that 'this' in that success handler was most likely not what you thought it was?
[11:50:49] <z1haze_work> and use a promise
[11:50:52] <Es0teric|work> taplar yeah
[11:51:12] <Es0teric|work> taplar but i have $(this) context solved but it affects all the divs thats my new problem now
[11:51:13] <taplar> and robert suggested adding the bind(this) to that function
[11:51:28] <z1haze_work> Es0teric|work: somthing like $.ajax(...).then(response => fav_count = $(this).find('.fav_count'))
[11:51:35] <z1haze_work> or that yea
[11:51:44] <z1haze_work> but if you use an arrow function you dont ahve to
[11:52:41] <Es0teric|work> nah that would work z1haze_work
[11:52:47] <Es0teric|work> thats way to excessive
[11:53:00] <z1haze_work> whats too excessive?
[11:53:04] <z1haze_work> using es6?
[11:53:05] <skypce> hi, i want remove a element if not exist , i have this code ,can you help me please http://pastebin.com/ijPqDey3
[11:53:55] <taplar> skypce: what is 'this'?
[11:54:45] <taplar> lol, context, the bane of javascript programmers
[11:55:52] <z1haze_work> Es0teric|work: let me try to help
[11:55:58] <Es0teric|work> z1haze_work ok
[11:56:01] <Es0teric|work> im all ears man
[11:57:16] <z1haze_work> https://jsfiddle.net/wzcyupxq/
[11:57:31] <Es0teric|work> dude
[11:57:33] <Es0teric|work> i cannot do that
[11:57:35] <Es0teric|work> there has be another way
[11:57:40] <z1haze_work> why in the hell not
[11:57:48] <z1haze_work> i dont understand what you cant do?
[11:57:48] <z1haze_work> es6?
[11:58:12] <Es0teric|work> dude
[11:58:19] <z1haze_work> sorry
[11:58:20] <Es0teric|work> thats switching the code that currently exists too much
[11:58:29] <z1haze_work> dude im just showing you how it can be done
[11:58:30] <Es0teric|work> my boss will definitely not allow that
[11:58:31] <z1haze_work> you dont have to take my code
[11:58:37] <z1haze_work> im showing you the concept
[11:58:44] <Es0teric|work> i get it
[11:58:45] <z1haze_work> hang on let me make it more friendly for you
[11:58:54] <Es0teric|work> but its too far from what i need done
[11:59:29] <taplar> can i ask, you said the scoped $this was affecting too much stuff
[11:59:41] <taplar> yes?
[12:00:49] <z1haze_work> ohhh
[12:00:56] <z1haze_work> then var a variable above
[12:00:57] <Es0teric|work> no, taplar -- $this was affecting the multiple divs... so if i add a +1 to one div, all the divs get a +1 as well instead of just the one that was clicked
[12:00:58] <z1haze_work> var that = this
[12:01:17] <taplar> and it was scoped to just that on click?
[12:01:21] <z1haze_work> simple fix and your boss can keep his ugly code
[12:01:28] <z1haze_work> just made a variable inside the .click
[12:01:31] <z1haze_work> like var that = this
[12:01:37] <Es0teric|work> well
[12:01:45] <Es0teric|work> this is buddypress coded
[12:01:46] <Es0teric|work> its not my boss's code..
[12:01:46] <taplar> yeah i'm just wondering if he was missing the 'var' part
[12:02:17] <z1haze_work> do you think he doesnt want you to change to es6? what specifically it 'too much'?
[12:02:35] <Es0teric|work> i dont want to get into it
[12:02:39] <Es0teric|work> its a buddypress site
[12:02:44] <Es0teric|work> changing too much would be a problem
[12:03:15] <Es0teric|work> especially changing to es6
[12:03:31] <Es0teric|work> but my question is -- how do i make the context of the click only apply to the div that was clicked
[12:03:45] <z1haze_work> the easiest way is what i just said
[12:03:48] <z1haze_work> var that = this;
[12:03:51] <taplar> can you make your fiddle show the case that it was affecting too much stuff?
[12:03:52] <Es0teric|work> i have that already
[12:03:58] <Es0teric|work> dude
[12:04:00] <Es0teric|work> seriously
[12:04:24] <z1haze_work> do you have an updated fiddle then?
[12:04:25] <taplar> or does it already?
[12:04:36] <z1haze_work> because the fiddle you gave us doesnt use that
[12:04:45] <Es0teric|work> <div class="some-class"><span>1</span></div> <div class="some-class"><span>1</span></div> <div class="some-class"><span>1</span></div> <div class="some-class"><span>1</span></div> <div class="some-class"><span>1</span></div> the goal is to add a +1 on the div that was clicked
[12:04:50] <Es0teric|work> but all of them get affected
[12:04:51] <Es0teric|work> you get it?
[12:04:57] <taplar> fiddle
[12:05:01] <z1haze_work> i have that already ' show me please
[12:05:04] <Es0teric|work> wow dude
[12:05:22] <z1haze_work> why are you getting so mad, trying to help u man
[12:05:53] <z1haze_work> last thing i knew line 38 was the problem because this wasnt what you need it to be
[12:07:22] <Es0teric|work> z1haze_work here you go https://jsfiddle.net/5w9Lrh54/1/
[12:07:38] <Es0teric|work> not difficult at all you see how i have multiple .activity ?
[12:07:57] <Es0teric|work> i want the click to only affect THAT specific activity div that was clicked
[12:08:13] <Es0teric|work> right now a change on click affects ALL of the divs
[12:08:32] <taplar> there's some script error in the console
[12:08:37] <Es0teric|work> of course there is
[12:08:42] <Es0teric|work> thats not all of the code
[12:08:49] <Es0teric|work> thats just one block
[12:09:06] <z1haze_work> usualy you can provide an isolated example
[12:09:16] <Es0teric|work> how would i isolate that?
[12:09:18] <Es0teric|work> its buddypress
[12:09:25] <z1haze_work> its javascript
[12:09:31] <z1haze_work> relax.
[12:09:34] <Es0teric|work> it would take me more time to find a way to isolate it than to just present how the code looks now
[12:09:43] <z1haze_work> we cant use it now though
[12:09:55] <taplar> i think it just needs the on click closed, lets see
[12:10:12] <z1haze_work> think about it, you know what you need to have happen, right? so make a fiddle that simulates what you are trying to have happen
[12:10:37] <Es0teric|work> i dont understand how describing what i need happened is any different than having a fiddle.. its pretty simple
[12:10:40] <Es0teric|work> its not something super complicated
[12:10:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5w9Lrh54/2/
[12:10:50] <Es0teric|work> i click on a div, i just want the div to be affected
[12:10:51] <Es0teric|work> thats it
[12:10:55] <z1haze_work> exactly
[12:11:00] <Es0teric|work> its not rocket science
[12:11:12] <z1haze_work> exactly
[12:11:22] <z1haze_work> make a fiddle that does just that without all the other stuff
[12:11:34] <Es0teric|work> dude... you're killing me here with this
[12:11:34] <Es0teric|work> lol
[12:11:53] <z1haze_work> alright man, my bad. hopefully taplar can get the code working
[12:11:57] <Es0teric|work> i literally just want one div to be affected on click
[12:12:01] <Es0teric|work> thats it
[12:12:19] <Es0teric|work> right now, currently all divs are affected
[12:12:44] <Es0teric|work> i dont see how you need to see an example of that... its pretty straightforward
[12:13:15] <taplar> 'this' is the 'div.activity'
[12:13:20] <Es0teric|work> right
[12:13:22] <taplar> and you are getting the parent of it
[12:13:45] <Es0teric|work> well if i click on the anchor, 'this' would be the anchor
[12:13:50] <Es0teric|work> and im getting the parent of the anchor which is .activity-meta
[12:13:56] <taplar> then you find the fav_count
[12:14:00] <Es0teric|work> right
[12:14:02] <taplar> which would find them in all the places
[12:14:38] <taplar> i'm confused why you are doing parent()
[12:14:51] <Es0teric|work> ok
[12:14:57] <Es0teric|work> let me explain
[12:14:59] <taplar> because it could be a nested element?
[12:15:01] <Es0teric|work> because you're not following
[12:15:24] <Es0teric|work> .activity contains an anchor right? this is the context of the clicked anchor within .activity
[12:15:46] <Es0teric|work> so because of that .parent() is used to grab .activity-meta
[12:15:51] <taplar> no dude
[12:15:54] <Es0teric|work> which contains .fav_count
[12:15:58] <taplar> the binding is on the div.activity
[12:16:02] <taplar> 'this' will be that guy
[12:16:12] <Es0teric|work> ok
[12:16:21] <Es0teric|work> so what you're saying is that i can just directly reference .fav_count?
[12:16:30] <Es0teric|work> so it would be $('.fav_count', this)
[12:16:33] <z1haze_work> some things you are doing jq() and some things you are doing $(), why?
[12:16:40] <MutantTurkey> so... i am using animate() to move a mobile menu out from the left (it's absolutely positioned, at left:-100% ), then I just animate it in to left:0;... works great on everything but an iphone, which like skips half of the animation on moving out
[12:16:47] <MutantTurkey> was wondering if there is anything i can do about that
[12:16:54] <taplar> that.find('.fav_count') or if you are hesitant for that, this.closest('div.activity').find('.fav_count')
[12:17:01] <taplar> err, r/this/that
[12:18:16] <Es0teric|work> taplar it still affects all of the divs man
[12:18:23] <Es0teric|work> i have fav_count = that.closest('div.activity').find('.fav_count');
[12:18:43] <z1haze_work> can you console.log fav_count?
[12:18:52] <z1haze_work> or console.dir() maybe
[12:19:01] <Es0teric|work> sec
[12:19:21] <taplar> i need to find were you are changing stuff, cause that fetch of data should be right
[12:19:35] <Es0teric|work> taplar [span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, span.fav_count, selector: ".fav_count", prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1], context: div.activity]
[12:19:45] <Es0teric|work> thats the console.log()
[12:19:46] <taplar> woah
[12:20:10] <taplar> that's saying that there are multiple fav_count's in a div.activity
[12:20:57] <taplar> according to "], context: div.activity] "
[12:21:12] <taplar> try this for shiggles
[12:21:48] <taplar> jq('div.activity').each(function(){ console.log( jq(this).find('.fav_count').length); });
[12:22:41] <Es0teric|work> sec
[12:22:55] <Es0teric|work> taplar output is 16
[12:23:16] <taplar> yep
[12:23:24] <taplar> you got markup issues man
[12:23:24] <taplar> or logic for that markup issues
[12:24:58] <taplar> if you only saw one output of 16, then that means one div.activity contains all your records with the fav_count's in them
[12:25:15] <taplar> brb, going to get food real quick
[12:25:15] <taplar> but i'm starting to wonder if your binding is too high
[12:25:15] <Es0teric|work> right
[12:25:27] <Es0teric|work> taplar actually i'll brb
[12:25:32] <Es0teric|work> i have to take care of something real quick
[12:25:55] <Es0teric|work> i need to do this before a specific time and im cutting close to it
[12:26:03] <Es0teric|work> not this specifically, but something else
[12:26:04] <Es0teric|work> lol
[12:36:48] <taplar> s'all good
[12:51:58] <manornk> Hi, I have $.post on link after input boxes. What would be good way to check if required field is filled?
[12:52:34] <Es0teric|Work> taplar alright i am back
[12:53:14] <taplar> manornk: you mean when you click the link it does a $.post?
[12:53:46] <Es0teric|Work> taplar ok so how would i go about solving the current problem i have?
[12:53:48] <manornk> taplar: yes
[12:54:26] <cannap> check the fields on the server is a good way
[12:54:36] <taplar> Es0teric|Work: well it seems like you were under the assumption that the div.activity would be a unique one per row.  so i would question if that should actually be the case and if the markup is accurate or not
[12:54:50] <Es0teric|Work> it is
[12:55:07] <manornk> cannap: yes, but i was wondering if there si a way with jquery to do this before server
[12:55:10] <Es0teric|Work> in terms of accuracy
[12:55:43] <cannap> sure
[12:55:43] <taplar> ok, in that case then you need to find a lower level element that actually is unique per row and possibly bind on that instead
[12:55:53] <cannap> $('input').val
[12:56:11] <cannap> there are inline validators
[12:56:23] <cannap> need some few lines of code
[12:56:28] <cannap> before you submit
[12:56:42] <Es0teric|Work> taplar hmmm ok
[12:57:08] <manornk> cannap: I will, thanls
[12:57:34] <cannap> jquery has everything
[12:57:38] <cannap> also via plugins
[12:57:51] <cannap> when you are lazy when you use this for just one form you dont need a whole plugin
[12:57:54] <cannap> you can go with else if
[12:57:55] <cannap> ^^
[13:00:12] <manornk> cannap: yeah, it is only one form
[13:00:48] <cannap> yea then make you own validation
[13:00:52] <cannap> but i cant explain this just so
[13:00:57] <cannap> google there are many tutorials
[13:01:05] <cannap> better use a tutorial and you will learn more stuff
[13:01:14] <cannap> its not just jquery needs some more js
[13:01:33] <cannap> most time in validation with jquery you use jquery just for the selectors
[13:01:34] <cannap> more not
[13:01:37] <manornk> cannap: Thanks, I will. Currently searching (on duckduckgo though :) )
[13:01:47] <taplar> good man!
[13:02:28] <taplar> or woman
[13:02:28] <taplar> person, really
[13:02:42] <cannap> what
[13:02:53] <taplar> lol, nothing
[13:03:53] <cannap> @manornk, https://formden.com/blog/validate-contact-form-jquery
[13:03:57] <taplar> it's friday and i have some mac n cheese.  i'm bound to say anything
[13:03:58] <cannap> this one does not use a plugin
[13:04:09] <cannap> its hard to find a not lazy guy writing jquery plugins
[13:04:44] <taplar> depending on what required stuff you are after, there are also the html5 stuff
[13:04:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:04:55] <robertmaxrees> default to that imo.
[13:05:05] <robertmaxrees> polyfill for browsers that don't support it.
[13:06:46] <manornk> cannap: great one.  :D
[13:07:29] <taplar> mdn article https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation
[13:08:04] <taplar> you can actually polyfill that stuff though?
[13:09:55] * taplar makes note he needs to read more on that, along with shadow doms
[13:12:15] <cannap> sure
[13:12:21] <cannap> but he asked about jquery solution
[13:12:42] <cannap> and just for one form
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> it's a disservice to not point out that you really should use native.
[13:12:56] <cannap> i forgot
[13:13:03] <robertmaxrees> no big.
[13:13:09] <robertmaxrees> that's why we mention these things.
[13:13:11] <cannap> yea just at type=email and required at the end
[13:13:17] <cannap> but style them
[13:13:20] <taplar> all about adding more tools to the toolbox
[13:13:23] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[13:13:30] <robertmaxrees> there's all kinds of validators and things built in.
[13:14:06] <cannap> he asked in jquery and not in js channel
[13:14:10] <cannap> xD
[13:14:21] <robertmaxrees> again
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:14:34] <taplar> if a dude asks how to animate something, i'm still going to tell him about css
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> disservice to not point out the native way that's arguably better.
[13:14:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:14:55] <cannap> jquery changes css ? :D
[13:15:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:15:07] <cannap> jk
[13:15:08] <robertmaxrees> so aaaaanyway
[13:15:14] <cannap> there are 10000000 solution
[13:15:23] <cannap> when any ask something i would just tell him dont use jquery..
[13:15:24] <cannap> but
[13:15:26] <cannap> yea
[13:15:33] <robertmaxrees> sure is a dead horse you're beating there ;)
[13:16:47] <taplar> i think it's more about a mind set
[13:17:00] <taplar> trying to avoid the 'i know this.  so i have to do it in this' mind set
[13:17:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:18:45] <Es0teric> taplar alright i finally got it i think
[13:19:00] <Es0teric> i just did jq('.fav').bind()
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> what version of jq are you using?
[13:19:12] <MassDebates> Did anyone happen to catch my questions earlier today?
[13:19:20] <taplar> awesome
[13:19:37] <taplar> your project idea thing?
[13:22:10] <MassDebates> Me?
[13:22:36] <taplar> ya
[13:22:44] <taplar> something about swapping syllabels or something
[13:25:08] <MassDebates> Can anyone help me? I'm making a script in an exercise that I'm doing for myself. I think it'll be hilariously fun to make. I'm trying to think of a way to detect and replace specific syllables based upon how they're phonetically pronounced.For example, I can say "Freedom" and I can say "Elephant" - They share a phonetic syllable, but it's spelled
[13:25:09] <MassDebates> differently AND it's in a different location relative to the word.
[13:25:17] <MassDebates> I thought about a couple ways of going about this: one is loading up a dictionary of sorts that will act as a safety (with both negatives and positives for the matching) and then just run a regex. The dictionary can handle the exceptions that wouldn't apply and then I can run a general swap out
[13:25:55] <MassDebates> Is this a poor way to go about it? Also, because this is an exercise for myself and not ever going to be in front of an end-user, I'd prefer to not use a lib that does this, and I'd prefer to keep it a lighter script
[13:26:31] <MassDebates> That's what I was originally posting if you wanted to see that again, but I can also elaborate with more detail if you want
[13:26:33] <robertmaxrees> well
[13:26:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd break that down a little differently.
[13:26:55] <taplar> mmm, i speak ah de engles, but i don't understand it's structure
[13:27:39] <robertmaxrees> so when you say "replace speciffic syllables", what would be an example of input vs output?
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> 'cause honestly a regex doesn't sound like it'll get you far.
[13:30:00] <robertmaxrees> really you want to tokenize each word and then find an appropriate replacement
[13:30:16] <MassDebates> I'm back, sorry
[13:30:28] <MassDebates> Chrome was having a heart attack os I closed some heavier stuff out
[13:30:37] <robertmaxrees> you see my questions/ideas?
[13:30:57] <MassDebates> I'm responding one moment
[13:31:42] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:31:54] <MassDebates> So i want to make a script that replaces all phonetic "J"s with the lettering dj. This includes adjunct, adjective, jest, jungle, major, general, addage, etc.
[13:32:18] <MassDebates> That's the use-case specifically. PLEASE don't code up a solution for me I want to do it
[13:32:43] <MassDebates> So when i first thought about this, I figured that I could use regex, but then I started thinking about how bad english is with consistency of method
[13:33:08] <MassDebates> So then I figured the smallest amount of work would be regex and then do a coverall filter of sorts to make 'exceptions' for both positive and negative.
[13:33:24] <MassDebates> meaning that some words will match the regex, but I'll have to take them out. Some words won't match it, but I'll have to add them in
[13:34:10] <MassDebates> I'm not sure how big the respective dictionaries for each side would be, but I don't like the lack of 'airtight'ness
[13:34:43] <MassDebates> So I tried thinking of how it'd work for javascript to scan individual letter constructs. Then I can programmatically affect all words and then significantly reduce my exceptionary dictionary.
[13:34:47] <MassDebates> exceptions dictionary* i think that is
[13:38:14] <MassDebates> Depending on how the jquery is addressed, I've got different plans for the CSS to manage some other stuff
[13:38:22] <MassDebates> Obviously if I do swaps, words will change, and this is likely to include size
[13:39:16] <MassDebates> So I'd use the javascript to make each word its own entity (or even smaller depending on the options I've listed above for myself if I've not forgotten about any possible avenus) then I'd use the datas to modify contents
[13:39:33] <MassDebates> Then I can reflow them again, with a variety of different possibilities with CSS for layout
[13:40:36] <MassDebates> For the input/output pairs that you asked for (whenever you get back that is) I was thinking that the examples above would come out to be: adjunct, adjective, djest, djungle, madjor, djeneral, addadje
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:40:49] <robertmaxrees> also: slow down heh
[13:41:09] <MassDebates> Digest, for example, would become didjest
[13:41:09] <MassDebates> Oh sorry ok
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're curious about language parsing tbh.
[13:43:27] <MassDebates> Well I want to primarily stick with javascript
[13:43:39] <MassDebates> And I figured a lingual thing would be pretty fun
[13:43:45] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:43:51] <robertmaxrees> you want to do language parsing in JS.
[13:44:23] <robertmaxrees> I'd head over to ##javascript and see what kind of suggestions they have.
[13:44:45] <MassDebates> Nobody responds to me :( I've bumped 2 or 3 times so far
[13:44:49] <MassDebates> And they know that I've asked
[13:45:06] <MassDebates> This is over the span of several hours so I wasn't spamming and I wasn't rude
[13:45:15] <MassDebates> I also made sure that people knew I was serious and wasn't trolling.
[13:45:19] <robertmaxrees> somethign tells me part of the reason is that you've got a really big, broad question.
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> wha's stopping you from getting started?
[13:48:12] <MassDebates> I don't want to get started making something that I'll have to undo if it's javascript
[13:48:20] <MassDebates> if it's CSS that I'm experimenting with, I'll whip that out in no time, even if it's advanced functionality like working with multiple shadow nodes
[13:48:40] <MassDebates> This is different for me though because I write slower, look up stuff, and all that jazz with javascript
[13:48:43] <robertmaxrees> are you using this as a learning opportunity?
[13:48:57] <MassDebates> I'd rather plan it out effectively (while being realistic to the scope here) and learn from it
[13:49:13] <MassDebates> Yes, but not just syntactically
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> then just start.
[13:49:30] <robertmaxrees> make mistakes.
[13:49:31] <robertmaxrees> fix them.
[13:49:44] <robertmaxrees> rewrite.  refactor.  delete and start over.
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> that's all part of the deal.
[13:49:54] <MassDebates> I want to make a clear plan of what I'm goign to be coding in javascript and then try to execute it so I can learn some flow without doing corrective work for 60% of the project
[13:50:10] <robertmaxrees> err, that's part of programming :)
[13:50:11] <MassDebates> Okay, I guess I'll just do that then
[13:50:11] <MassDebates> thanks
[13:50:24] <MassDebates> You don't plan when you program?
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating "plan" with "execution"
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> sometimes things don't go as planned.
[13:50:44] <MassDebates> I came up with a couple different plans that vary slightly in concept but likely vary quite a bit in execution
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> i whiteboard all the time.  but it's not uncommon to have to completely rethink something as I'm working with it.
[13:51:14] <MassDebates> Why work on bridge B when it won't work in the end? I know you can learn from mistakes, but you can learn from success too
[13:51:32] <robertmaxrees> because you cannot teach judgement.
[13:51:34] <MassDebates> I suppose you're right though.
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> you gotta experience it firsthand.f
[13:51:51] <robertmaxrees> make mistakes - it's not a problem.
[13:52:04] <MassDebates> Alright, well, don't jdudje me for asking :P
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> we're not.
[13:52:12] <MassDebates> I'll try a couple things and bring it to you if it's on fire
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:52:20] <robertmaxrees> nono.
[13:52:25] <MassDebates> I just wanted an excuse to write in jdudje hahaha
[13:54:12] <MassDebates> Okay I pulled up a codepen and I fitted in some text content. I think I'll work on some basic regex first and see how bad the exceptions situation might be
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> good luck
[13:54:37] <MassDebates> Regardless of it being on fire or not, I'll bring it back to you to show you where I've gotten
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:54:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't need updates hahaha
[13:54:51] <robertmaxrees> if you have questions, feel free to ask in here.
[13:54:56] <robertmaxrees> or even better, in ##javascript.
[13:54:57] <MassDebates> Ok
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> since you're not really working with jQuery.
[13:55:14] <MassDebates> I'll bump it one last time in there so I can work while they may/may not put in some helpful tips
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:55:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:55:22] <MassDebates> thanks again
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:55:55] <MassDebates> Is there much from jquery that I'd be able to leverage for convenience?
[13:56:00] <codecutter> how do i insert the array object 'arr' into the data [] replace existing contents with arr?  http://pastebin.com/v4HATNEe
[13:56:11] <MassDebates> I'm talking about the minor parts of completing the tasks I want to complete
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates you're not really doing with against the DOM.
[13:56:15] <codecutter> part of the highcharts series
[13:56:19] <robertmaxrees> *work against
[13:56:23] <robertmaxrees> you're working with text.
[13:56:24] <robertmaxrees> so not really.
[13:56:52] <MassDebates> Ah, I never made that connection
[13:57:01] <MassDebates> thanks I'm out of your hair now
[13:57:30] <codecutter> how do i insert the array object 'arr' into the data [] replace existing contents with arr?  http://pastebin.com/v4HATNEe
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> codecutter no need to spam :)
[13:57:48] <robertmaxrees> saw it the first time ;)
[13:57:49] <codecutter> sorry
[13:58:07] <robertmaxrees> your question is confusing - what do you mean?
[13:59:31] <codecutter> thats because its wrpng pastebin
[13:59:33] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/R7Qa4aaT
[14:00:06] <codecutter> i need to insert the arr object in to data array line 19
[14:00:21] <robertmaxrees> insert or replace what's there?
[14:00:31] <codecutter> line 19 is an extract from highcharts  https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/spline-irregular-time/
[14:00:51] <robertmaxrees> so you want to replace something in an array
[14:00:58] <codecutter> yes
[14:01:08] <robertmaxrees> theArray[5] = the New Thing.
[14:01:41] <codecutter> that does not work
[14:01:46] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[14:02:17] <codecutter> let me show the format of the 'arr' object then you will see why
[14:02:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jpfkw4rx/
[14:02:28] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:02:39] <robertmaxrees> it's an array.  point to the index and replace the value...
[14:02:50] <robertmaxrees> the format of the array doesn't really matter.
[14:03:11] <codecutter> did you see the data portion of this link https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/spline-irregular-time/
[14:03:19] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:03:28] <codecutter> have a look at line 45
[14:03:30] <robertmaxrees> it's an array of arrays.
[14:03:35] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[14:03:37] <codecutter> ok now let me show the 'arr' object
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:03:49] <codecutter> 1 sec
[14:04:42] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/q5f8bNFv
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jpfkw4rx/1/
[14:05:29] <codecutter> arr object is a like a map
[14:05:31] <codecutter> see about
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> it's still an array.
[14:05:49] <robertmaxrees> in js, you have Objects and Arrays.
[14:05:54] <codecutter> when why is not working?
[14:06:06] <codecutter> data = arr?
[14:06:07] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:06:07] <DexDeadly> I got a question, I'm using .on('click' for some buttons.  https://jsfiddle.net/ccyc4t19/ Here is the javascript.  As you can see upon a sucessful post I'm loading a div to redisplay a set of payment sources.  However upon the load in the div, the buttons no longer bind to the .on('click' event.  I tried reloading the functions as you can see after the div is loaded but its not woking
[14:06:17] <codecutter> then*
[14:06:18] <codecutter> lol
[14:06:33] <robertmaxrees> codecutter pass that data to JSON.stringify()
[14:06:39] <robertmaxrees> because that lod doesn't tell me much.
[14:06:53] <codecutter> ok
[14:06:54] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly use a delegated handler instead
[14:07:14] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:07:48] <codecutter> [{"date":"2017-1-31","val":1},{"date":"2017-2-22","val":1},{"date":"2017-2-26","val":1},{"date":"2017-3-15","val":1}]
[14:07:57] <robertmaxrees> codecutter yeah, that's an array of objects.
[14:08:00] <robertmaxrees> same rules pply.
[14:08:01] <robertmaxrees> *apply
[14:08:57] <robertmaxrees> codecutter https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/y9stcLw0/
[14:09:18] <robertmaxrees> codecutter is your real problem that the charts don't update when you modify the array?
[14:11:04] <codecutter> data: '[{"date":"2017-1-31","val":1},{"date":"2017-2-22","val":1},{"date":"2017-2-26","val":1},{"date":"2017-3-15","val":1}]'
[14:11:09] <codecutter> gives me a blank chart
[14:11:15] <DexDeadly> so I did https://jsfiddle.net/ccyc4t19/1/ where I added the #payments since this is the div that its in.
[14:11:17] <robertmaxrees> because you're passing a string.
[14:11:30] <DexDeadly> it still doesn't load
[14:11:31] <codecutter> even if i remove the outter ''
[14:11:37] <codecutter> data: [{"date":"2017-1-31","val":1},{"date":"2017-2-22","val":1},{"date":"2017-2-26","val":1},{"date":"2017-3-15","val":1}]
[14:11:39] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly right, you still need to uise a delegated listener.
[14:11:49] <robertmaxrees> codecutter is that even the right format for the chart library you're using?
[14:12:21] <codecutter> have a look at the format https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/demo/spline-irregular-time/
[14:12:26] <robertmaxrees> codecutter dude
[14:12:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:12:38] <codecutter> line 45
[14:12:42] <codecutter> whats up?
[14:12:51] <robertmaxrees> relinking the same things over and over isn't gonna get you very far.
[14:13:18] <codecutter> you just asked me about the format of data
[14:13:33] <robertmaxrees> i asked you to verify it yourself ;)
[14:13:39] <DexDeadly> hmmm ok so a delegated listener
[14:15:12] <docmur> How do I loop over an array and print the items to the textarea: https://jsfiddle.net/skubydec/4/
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> docmur forEach
[14:15:30] <robertmaxrees> not each
[14:16:31] <robertmaxrees> also textareas don't take markup.
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> and you want .val()
[14:16:38] <codecutter> {"date":"2017-1-31","val":1} should be {"2017-1-31",1}
[14:16:52] <robertmaxrees> codecutter that's not valid
[14:16:56] <robertmaxrees> use [] instead.
[14:17:49] <codecutter> i may need to modify the sortMapAsc() function
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> within highcharts??
[14:18:10] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/R7Qa4aaT
[14:18:20] <robertmaxrees> that your code?
[14:18:22] <DexDeadly>  $('div#payments').on('click', '.defaultSource', function (e) {
[14:18:24] <DexDeadly> got it
[14:18:27] <DexDeadly> thanks robertmaxrees
[14:18:29] <codecutter> yes
[14:18:31] <robertmaxrees> DexDeadly fwiw don't use div there
[14:18:34] <robertmaxrees> just #payments
[14:18:38] <DexDeadly> oh ok
[14:18:42] <robertmaxrees> codecutter uh
[14:18:48] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm
[14:18:55] <DexDeadly> i did some searching off what you said and the exampls showed div but if I dont need it then its gone
[14:19:06] <codecutter> go on..
[14:19:13] <robertmaxrees> codecutter no i misread something you said.
[14:19:22] <robertmaxrees> so long as you're not modifying highcharts itself, you're fine.
[14:20:12] <codecutter> how do i modify the above function so that its the same format as highcharts?
[14:20:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> oh.  easy
[14:21:20] <robertmaxrees> return { date: key, val: map[key] }
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> just fix that.
[14:21:59] <codecutter> i tried '{ key,  map[key]}  });'
[14:22:07] <robertmaxrees> bruh
[14:22:07] <codecutter> which gives an error
[14:22:17] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said about each object :)
[14:23:24] <codecutter> what line?
[14:23:57] <robertmaxrees> in response to when you said " {"date":"2017-1-31","val":1} should be {"2017-1-31",1}"
[14:24:08] <VX> docmur since you dont have a JS library selected, you can do it like this https://jsfiddle.net/skubydec/7/
[14:24:46] <robertmaxrees> VX the implication was that he wanted jq ;)
[14:25:26] <VX> robertmaxrees sure i must have come into the conversation late, all i noticed was that he didnt have a lib selected in the fiddle
[14:25:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty common mistake :)
[14:27:02] <VX> but in that case docmur https://jsfiddle.net/skubydec/9/
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> don't even need that.
[14:27:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/skubydec/10/
[14:27:28] <robertmaxrees> no need for an each at all.
[14:30:46] <codecutter> ok now i can see the chart '[["2017-1-31",1],["2017-3-15",1],["2017-2-22",1],["2017-2-26",1]]'
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:31:06] <codecutter> but the x-axis where the date should be is all messed up
[14:31:09] <codecutter> no so fast :)
[14:31:12] <codecutter> not*
[14:31:17] <robertmaxrees> how is it messed up?
[14:31:29] <robertmaxrees> because things are in the wrong order?
[14:31:33] <codecutter> i think i know why
[14:31:39] <codecutter> 1 sec
[14:33:17] <codecutter> 'All series have a dummy year of 1970/71 in order to be compared on the same x axis'
[14:33:24] <codecutter> which is missing
[14:33:55] <codecutter> i need to add 'dummy date' to the first element of each array
[14:34:02] <robertmaxrees> then add it?
[14:35:18] <Es0teric> if i wanted to grab a value from a div then add to it.. it would be ( $('.div').text() + 1 )
[14:35:20] <Es0teric> right?
[14:35:35] <robertmaxrees> add as in increment the number?
[14:35:39] <robertmaxrees> gotta convert to a number first.
[14:35:52] <Es0teric> ahh
[14:39:05] <bjsnider> wouldn't the +1 do the type conversion?
[14:39:24] <robertmaxrees> it'll coerce the number to a string.
[14:40:19] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p1yjmru2/
[14:40:26] <taplar> if you've ever seen the WAT presentation, it's evident that being explicit is often a good thing, ;)
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> haha
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah, relying at all on JS's attempt to infer type and coercion is a really bad idea.
[14:56:07] <bjsnider> i could not figure out the structure of a cloned object, and finally got to be able to iterate through it with each, but how does one figure out what a js object looks like?
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> js or JQ?
[14:56:36] <sustained> Should $('div.blah[text^=Foo]') not match <div class="blah">Foo Bar</div> ?
[14:56:50] <bjsnider> i tried using .text or console.log, but it gave me the type and then something like "divelement" or something
[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider JSON.stringify(theObject)
[14:57:09] <snover> console.dir(obj)
[14:57:19] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[14:57:35] <bjsnider> console.dir? never heard of it
[14:57:43] <snover> and now you have.
[14:57:46] <robertmaxrees> the console api has tons of neat methods.
[14:57:51] <sustained> As it doesn't seem to be working
[14:58:51] <robertmaxrees> text isn't an attribute sustained
[14:58:56] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[15:07:28] <bjsnider> well, console.dir is very revealing, although this cloned object is full of a dizzying array of key:value pairs 90% of which are null
[15:07:45] <bjsnider> not sure it helps a poor fool like me know how to manipulate this object
[15:09:36] <bjsnider> so innerhtml contains all the tags and innertext contains all the values i suppose
[15:09:55] <snover> no
[15:10:52] <taplar> innerText looks like an IE thing
[15:10:56] <snover> also no
[15:11:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:11:11] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/innerText
[15:11:25] <robertmaxrees> it's the rendered text of the node and it's children, right?
[15:11:26] <taplar> ah, nvm
[15:11:35] <robertmaxrees> err, descendents.
[15:11:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[15:11:38] <snover> yep
[15:11:54] <bjsnider> if i'm understanding this right, every time you tell jquery to create an object, eg. clone or whatever, it fills the object with all of these key:value pairs, as each one allows jquery's methods to be applied if so desired
[15:12:00] <robertmaxrees> since the DOM represents text as being within a node IIRC.
[15:12:28] <taplar> a text node
[15:12:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:12:41] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider it creates an array-like object with those objects, yeah.  but it's pretty trivial to enumerate on them.
[15:12:44] <robertmaxrees> that;'s what .each() is for.
[15:13:18] <taplar> kinda interesting.  i wonder what use case there is for that
[15:14:34] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: isn't every object in some abstract sense array-like? ie. key:value pairs
[15:14:46] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> that's conflating it.
[15:15:15] <robertmaxrees> in JS, arrays use numbered indices
[15:15:25] <snover> in javascript, “array-like” means an object with numeric indexes and a length property
[15:15:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:16:00] <robertmaxrees> they're still key: value pairs, but the key is a number.
[15:16:07] <bjsnider> i was speaking in a more general sense, not specific to javascript's rules, but in how it looks to my eyes
[15:16:25] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of associative arrays.
[15:17:07] <bjsnider> personally i find the distinction arbitrary
[15:17:11] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[15:17:17] <robertmaxrees> it's actually kind of important.
[15:18:10] <bjsnider> clearly it's important
[15:20:00] <bjsnider> in other words, to me, javascript's associative arrays are called objects
[15:20:14] <bjsnider> but it's a matter of nomenclature
[15:20:18] <robertmaxrees> not entirely.
[15:20:30] <robertmaxrees> they're similar, but not the same.
[15:20:31] <bjsnider> the important thing to me is the key:value pairs
[17:03:25] <MassDebates> unitPrice =  row.querySelector('.cell:nth-child(4)'), nth-child works in this context, right?
[17:04:40] <taplar> i don't see an issue
[17:05:11] <MassDebates> K thanks
[17:05:17] <MassDebates> Eliminating possibilities here
[17:15:02] <MassDebates> taplar:  I'm having trouble weeding out an issue
[17:15:06] <MassDebates> taplar:  I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of undefined
[17:15:17] <robertmaxrees> code?
[17:15:21] <MassDebates> After checking through console I fouind the problem area
[17:15:24] <taplar> make sure the Element exists
[17:15:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:16:03] <MassDebates> It's not an element, it's a function
[17:16:11] <MassDebates> I'll provide the code. I'm trying to change past code
[17:16:13] <taplar> huh?
[17:16:23] <taplar> addEventListener is a method off of an Element
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: addEventListener is for nodes.
[17:16:28] <robertmaxrees> and this isn't ##javascript
[17:16:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:16:47] <MassDebates> Hold on now, hahaha I remember you telling me #jquery IS ##javascript and it's ALL programming
[17:16:48] <MassDebates> :P
[17:16:56] <MassDebates> I'll jump over to javascript though
[17:17:01] <robertmaxrees> aces. thanks.
[17:17:17] <MassDebates> querySelector is jquery though, no?
[17:17:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:17:23] <MassDebates> Oh maybe not
[17:17:24] <taplar> #jquery isn't ##javascript.  they both are channels though
[17:17:27] <taplar> ;)
[17:17:39] <MassDebates> I was just being a jerk lol
[17:17:44] <taplar> same
[18:23:34] <skypce> i have a problem with a jquery code, it is very simple, jquery channel is dead
[18:23:35] <skypce> <skypce> http://pastebin.com/Gnwrajs6
[18:23:35] <skypce> <skypce> i want remove a element when children is empty
[18:23:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:23:52] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[18:23:56] <robertmaxrees> that's the issue?
[18:24:18] <skypce> i dont know i was checked for a mistake in the console , but code is correct
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> what's it supposed to do that it's not doing?
[18:25:00] <robertmaxrees> kinda need a bit more to go on here.
[18:25:04] <skypce> i want that remove a element from dom, when a children is empty
[18:25:14] <robertmaxrees> mind showing your html?
[18:32:49] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:33:36] <jak2000> hi all
[18:35:47] <robertmaxrees> skypce ...
[18:36:01] <taplar> lol
[18:36:07] <jak2017> taplar what do you preffer?
[18:36:16] <taplar> wha?
[18:36:22] <jak2017> beers?
[18:36:33] <taplar> i'm a non-drinker actually
[18:37:44] <robertmaxrees> skypce becuase https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6w6L7L1f/1/
[18:39:51] <skypce> thank you robertmaxrees
[18:39:55] <skypce> i am very tired
[18:39:55] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[18:39:59] <robertmaxrees> not surewhat the issue is.
[18:40:02] <skypce> sorry for not made the html
[18:40:05] <alexbodn> hello friends. i'm using jquery ui for the autocomplete widget, but it takes over all the page. i wish to select the appropriate css for all widgets, but only for elements with ui-* class. could you suggest?
[18:44:40] <MassDebates> can I use .value with contentEditable attribute?
[18:44:49] <robertmaxrees> test for yourself
[18:44:51] <robertmaxrees> or check mdn
[18:45:24] <MassDebates> I tested but I don't know if it's because of this or another issue that I'm ignorantly considering unrelated
[18:45:33] <MassDebates> I went on the MDN pages here and here (links inc)
[18:45:58] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to make a test case.
[18:46:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xotwv055/
[18:46:36] <robertmaxrees> like...
[18:46:45] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple stuff
[18:47:04] <MassDebates> So that's a no, then?
[18:47:06] <MassDebates> Because that doesn't work
[18:47:30] <robertmaxrees> what do you think?
[18:47:35] <taplar> we need to get you some coding confidence bro
[18:47:46] <MassDebates> I just dont know if the test is correct when I test something
[18:48:05] <robertmaxrees> then ask for verification
[18:48:08] <robertmaxrees> but think of it this way:
[18:48:17] <MassDebates> I mean if you wanted me to link the test case I could have
[18:48:19] <robertmaxrees> you asked "does .value work with contenteditable"
[18:48:21] <MassDebates> I didn't think you needed one to know
[18:48:31] <robertmaxrees> because you shouldn't need to ask :)
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> it's super easy to make an isolated test case to prove/disprove
[18:48:47] <robertmaxrees> which is why i linked that fiddle.
[18:48:55] <MassDebates> I have no way of knowing if I made the test case correctly to test it
[18:48:58] <MassDebates> Not yet
[18:49:01] <robertmaxrees> then you can ask us.
[18:49:07] <robertmaxrees> and share your test case.
[18:49:20] <MassDebates> I will share it from now on, then
[18:49:22] <taplar> something like this though is a straight p -> q test
[18:49:38] <MassDebates> P 9> q doesn't work
[18:49:44] <MassDebates> Because the person who typed '9'
[18:49:44] <robertmaxrees> huh
[18:49:46] <MassDebates> is an idiot
[18:49:47] <robertmaxrees> duder
[18:49:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:49:51] <robertmaxrees> calm down
[18:49:52] <MassDebates> and he incorrectly typed in the test.
[18:50:01] <MassDebates> How does said idiot know if test is correct
[18:50:02] <robertmaxrees> no need to be totally self deprecating.
[18:50:04] <robertmaxrees> you're learning.
[18:50:09] <robertmaxrees> we can help you with that.
[18:50:27] <MassDebates> I fucking hate fridays
[18:50:30] <MassDebates> I want my fucking staff back
[18:50:35] <MassDebates> I hate being alone
[18:50:37] <robertmaxrees> that escalated quickly.
[18:50:39] <MassDebates> I can't ask anyone anything
[18:50:45] <robertmaxrees> you can ask us duder.
[18:50:47] <robertmaxrees> it' all good.
[18:50:50] <MassDebates> No i mean
[18:50:57] <MassDebates> I don't have anyone here. I like talking more than I like typing when asking questions
[18:51:07] <MassDebates> 'here' as in in the office
[18:51:24] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  just sayin' - there's lots of ways to get the help you need :)
[18:51:39] <MassDebates> I really appreciate you guys though, don't think I'm disregarding you
[18:51:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[18:51:57] <robertmaxrees> just gotta learn how to test things.
[18:51:59] <robertmaxrees> and read docs.
[18:52:05] <robertmaxrees> those are great skills to have.
[18:52:05] <taplar> i just want you to be more confident, personally
[18:52:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:52:13] <MassDebates> The MDN's docs on javascript are much harder to do than CSS
[18:52:22] <skypce> guys , i cant target the selector , what can be the problem
[18:52:23] <skypce> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LWrKpy
[18:52:24] <robertmaxrees> which is why I said you gotta learn how to read docs.
[18:52:48] <MassDebates> holy goodness skypce
[18:53:04] <MassDebates> Skypce Do you know much about selectors?
[18:53:09] <robertmaxrees> skypce no jq included there.
[18:53:18] <MassDebates> If not, there's a couple nice tools that you can use to demystify that mess there
[18:53:26] <MassDebates> Selectoracle is a great one
[18:54:20] <robertmaxrees> skypce so this is just a misunderstanding.
[18:54:27] <MassDebates> Also, you may want to invest some time into setting up some CSS architecture for yourself if this project is any bigger
[18:54:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:54:39] <robertmaxrees> skypce https://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[18:54:48] <MassDebates> Checking out BEM might be helpful in the future.
[18:54:56] <robertmaxrees> yo
[18:55:03] <taplar> yeah i was trying to figure out how empty works with is
[18:55:03] <robertmaxrees> can we help the dude with his actual question?
[18:55:10] <robertmaxrees> "One important thing to note with :empty (and :parent) is that child elements include text nodes."
[18:55:14] <MassDebates> Oh right
[18:55:14] <MassDebates> Let me look
[18:55:19] <robertmaxrees> i've got it already.
[18:55:27] <robertmaxrees> :empty looks for all nodes, including text nodes.
[18:55:37] <robertmaxrees> skypce you've got text in there.
[18:55:43] <robertmaxrees> try doing .text('').length
[18:56:01] <skypce> ok i will try thank you
[18:56:22] <taplar> without the quotes though right?
[18:56:24] <MassDebates> That's not how the pseudo class works. You'll need to use jquery in another way that can tell h
[18:56:26] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah
[18:56:26] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[18:56:27] <MassDebates> Oh shoot
[18:56:34] <MassDebates> way ahead of me
[18:56:47] <robertmaxrees> been way ahead of you
[18:56:50] <robertmaxrees> !$(".wrapper-overlay .wrapper-overlay-outside .related-treatment-category .form-group .view-category-side-bar-view .view-content .views-row").text().trim().length
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> tjhat's your condition.
[18:57:26] <robertmaxrees> since the textNode has a bunch of whitespace in it.
[18:57:46] <MassDebates> I realize now that I've got quite a bit of work ahead of me with this script
[18:57:55] <MassDebates> I can't use .value so I'll use inner
[18:57:57] <MassDebates> probably text
[18:58:35] <robertmaxrees> sure that's what you want?
[18:58:48] <MassDebates> Well, the way I see it is
[18:58:55] <robertmaxrees> back up
[18:59:04] <robertmaxrees> what documentation did you read to back up your idea?
[18:59:04] * MassDebates can't reach the keyboard anymore
[18:59:16] <MassDebates> Dude I totally was gonna say this
[18:59:22] <MassDebates> before said backup
[18:59:41] <MassDebates> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/innerText
[18:59:49] <MassDebates> This is what I was looking at.
[19:00:00] <robertmaxrees> hehj
[19:00:02] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[19:00:03] <MassDebates> So I was about to use console.log with that to see if it pulls a value correctly
[19:00:09] <MassDebates> Then I know if I can make my changes
[19:00:21] <robertmaxrees> did you search google for "get content of contenteditable" or anything like that?
[19:00:33] <MassDebates> No I browsed the spec and mdn
[19:00:37] <skypce> i was modified it, nothing works yet
[19:00:38] <MassDebates> Until I saw something I liked
[19:00:38] <skypce> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LWrKpy
[19:00:50] <robertmaxrees> because innerText and innerHTML both do diferent things with that.
[19:00:55] <MassDebates> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeValue I was going to try this after
[19:01:10] <robertmaxrees> skypce again
[19:01:12] <robertmaxrees> no jquery
[19:01:24] <MassDebates> But I wasn't entirely sure because I thought that it would end up in null because I think the issue is for the same reason that I can't do a lot of stuff with contenteditable stuff in CSS
[19:01:25] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates read up on the difference of innerHTML and innerText
[19:01:44] <robertmaxrees> and bad rationale.
[19:01:50] <robertmaxrees> CSSOM and DOM aren't the same thing.
[19:02:08] <MassDebates> I know
[19:02:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:02:16] <MassDebates> But there's lots of parallels that really helped me int he past
[19:02:25] <robertmaxrees> you'll start needing to leave those behind.
[19:02:28] <robertmaxrees> since they're not the same.
[19:02:49] <MassDebates> I can use innerHTML, innerText and html
[19:02:55] <MassDebates> it doesn't matter
[19:03:04] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[19:03:12] <robertmaxrees> skypce http://codepen.io/anon/pen/aJKgBB
[19:03:15] <robertmaxrees> with jquery included.
[19:03:27] <MassDebates> Are you sure that's the case?
[19:03:34] <robertmaxrees> feel free to prove me wrong.
[19:03:36] <MassDebates> None of the values will have newlines.
[19:03:39] <MassDebates> okay
[19:03:43] <skypce> thank you so much  robertmaxrees
[19:03:53] <MassDebates> Bring it mr jkwertywizard
[19:03:55] <MassDebates> Trying it now
[19:03:56] <robertmaxrees> protip: if you're not using contenteditable features, why use contenteditable?
[19:04:23] <MassDebates> I'll be honest I forget
[19:04:25] <MassDebates> I'm just doing what my employee told me
[19:04:32] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[19:04:43] <MassDebates> Else I'd have stuck with my WORKING inputs.
[19:05:02] <MassDebates> And I really want to do this before he does it
[19:05:27] <taplar> technically a contenteditable can have new lines.  a user can paste text into it with newlines
[19:05:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:05:37] <robertmaxrees> and it can contain all kinds of other content.
[19:05:51] <ZoderUck> hi
[19:06:08] <ZoderUck> a generic api ?
[19:06:16] <robertmaxrees> yes !
[19:06:19] <robertmaxrees> (?)
[19:06:29] <ZoderUck> i donti want to read back, where is this discussion about?  the best framework ?
[19:06:37] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck huh?
[19:06:39] <taplar> legos
[19:06:41] <robertmaxrees> what discussion?
[19:06:44] <ZoderUck> o
[19:06:50] <ZoderUck> ok. i will not contribute haha
[19:07:01] <taplar> we don't know the context of your question ZoderUck
[19:07:03] <MassDebates> taplar:  None of the fields will require newlines but I don't mind if they're included or removed.
[19:07:50] <taplar> i was mainly pointing out that the statement of the values will not have new lines could be false
[19:08:17] <MassDebates> Oh I see what you're saying, I can't guarantee that
[19:09:10] <MassDebates> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3593626/get-the-text-content-from-a-contenteditable-div-through-javascript
[19:09:19] <MassDebates> This is why I thought I could use any of them
[19:09:26] <MassDebates> But I'm realizing now that I don't like where I was originally thinking of putting the console log
[19:10:08] <MassDebates> And it'll need more than just a couple log insertions to actually test, no?
[19:10:25] <MassDebates> I'm going to work at trying to implement the solution. I made a copy of the current code so I can go back if i need to
[19:10:37] <MassDebates> That is the most accessible test to me atm I think
[19:11:22] <taplar> that S.O. is kinda confusing.  the OP says innerHTML didn't work for him, but the accepted solution uses html()
[19:13:19] <taplar> gotta stop reading S.O. before i get sucked in
[19:15:44] <MassDebates> Hm
[19:15:45] <MassDebates> I can use all of them though
[19:17:00] <MassDebates> Uh oh
[19:17:01] <MassDebates> I think I made a mistake though
[19:17:05] <MassDebates> I think I'm updating the wrong fields http://codepen.io/MassDebates/pen/gmKJwm/?editors=0110
[19:17:45] <taplar> so i'm going to throw this out there
[19:17:47] <robertmaxrees> what does the customer-data deal have do with with this?
[19:17:57] <taplar> are you using contenteditable so you don't have borders on your input spaces?
[19:18:09] <MassDebates> lol no
[19:18:21] <taplar> k, just checking
[19:18:24] <MassDebates> cause I can totally whip input styling around like nobody's business
[19:18:36] <taplar> yup
[19:18:38] <MassDebates> I just made a exampe on child dom styling the other day
[19:18:50] <MassDebates> Yo I'm legit awesome at CSS
[19:19:12] <MassDebates> This whole script business though is ridiculous
[19:19:47] <MassDebates> We're doing no inputs for some sort of a browser thing
[19:20:04] <MassDebates> We're not using chrome it's something weird
[19:20:24] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're making it so hard.
[19:20:52] <robertmaxrees> you just wanna add together a bunch of inputs, right?
[19:21:30] <MassDebates> I can't use inputs
[19:22:03] <MassDebates> But yes I want to add them
[19:22:09] <MassDebates> I'm trying to avoid giving them classes
[19:22:12] <robertmaxrees> why?
[19:22:13] <taplar> i'm thinking one issue is you are binding on keydown
[19:22:17] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:22:28] <taplar> change to the element wouldn't have happened at that point
[19:22:58] <taplar> but this is all vanilla so i kinda want to point you to ##javascript
[19:23:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[19:23:45] <MassDebates> ##javascript is the one that made me do keydown
[19:24:33] <MassDebates> hm, I could make it wait and then re-check, right?
[19:24:33] <taplar> i could be wrong, but my recollection of keydown is that the change to the field has not been made yet
[19:24:55] <taplar> which is why you can cancel the event to prevent the change
[19:24:56] <taplar> or use keyup
[19:24:59] <MassDebates> like a listener nested via conditional after the first
[19:25:00] <MassDebates> What your'e saying makes sense taplar
[19:25:00] <MassDebates> Is what I'm saying making sense though
[19:25:30] <MassDebates> OHHHHHHHHH
[19:25:30] <MassDebates> TRICKY TRICKY
[19:25:30] <MassDebates> Shiiiiz man keyup
[19:25:30] <MassDebates> sounds like it'll do it brb
[19:25:35] <taplar> what do you mean wait?
[19:26:07] <robertmaxrees> do input instead.
[19:26:13] <taplar> i'd argue for the use of keyup as it is an existing hook point
[19:26:13] <taplar> instead of contriving something else
[19:26:17] <MassDebates> Well, keyup did it but if keyup didn't exist I would have considered having a nested condition, basically something like
[19:26:29] <MassDebates> listen for keydown > if true > listen again for keydown
[19:26:40] <robertmaxrees> either way, head on back to ##javascript :)
[19:26:56] <taplar> or that
[19:27:25] <MassDebates> okay, but rather than explain the whole context
[19:27:25] <MassDebates> I want to know if that would've worked
[19:27:57] <MassDebates> (without going through the hour work of testing and then testing the test and correcting if possible)
[19:28:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a great question...for ##javascript
[19:28:11] <MassDebates> or doing a sleep
[19:28:28] <MassDebates> If ##javascript had the context. I'll leave it as a mystery for today.
[19:28:36] <MassDebates> Thanks guys
[19:28:45] <taplar> sleep?
[19:29:27] <MassDebates> You can't ask for more information for a question you don't want to answer.
[19:31:18] <taplar> you think we are being unfair pointing you to js?
[19:35:30] <taplar> anyways, 6:30 so i'm gonna jet.  catch everyone later.
[19:35:39] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[19:35:45] <taplar> you know it
