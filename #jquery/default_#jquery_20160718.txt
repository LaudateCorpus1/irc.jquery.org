[01:31:38] <jerrry> Can anybody tell me how to use jquery to turn a returned value from comment_39 to just 39?
[01:32:24] <jerrry> Right now I have $(this).closest('.comment-panel').attr('id'); which gives me comment_39, but I just need the 39 part. :P
[01:35:43] <jerrry> nvm, figured it out. slice()
[01:38:04] <yurakeshi> jerrry, you could also do yourstring.split('_')[1]
[01:50:20] <jerrry> Thanks yurakeshi, is one way cleaner than the other?
[01:54:46] <ElGatoSaez> https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ hey I'm learning this
[01:55:12] <ElGatoSaez> now how can I see the contents of that *:contains
[01:55:17] <ElGatoSaez> because I put that in a var
[01:56:23] <yurakeshi> jerrry, if you use slice you have to take care of the size of the number, so it should be like str.slice(str.lastIndexOf('_') - str.length). Using split you should worry only if comment can have more than one '_', if so it should be .split('_').reverse()[0];
[01:56:57] <jerrry> yurakeshi: thanks, got it.
[01:57:00] <yurakeshi> if I'm right I'd prefer .split()
[01:59:58] <ElGatoSaez> I mean what does a :contains contain?
[02:00:45] <MarkTheMark> does anyone know how to create this kind of list using css or jquery that’s similar to iphone’s select box? (look at the image) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9560259/ios-javascript-selectoption-not-populating-list-when-tapping-next
[02:02:32] <yurakeshi> ElGatoSaez, it must be used with an text to search. $("li:contains('Test')") will match <li>Test</li>
[02:02:57] <ElGatoSaez> how can I know for example how much did it match
[02:03:01] <MarkTheMark> sorry for the repeat but
[02:03:04] <MarkTheMark> does anyone know how to create this kind of list using css or jquery that’s similar to iphone’s select box? (look at the image) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9560259/ios-javascript-selectoption-not-populating-list-when-tapping-next
[02:03:18] <yurakeshi> if you want to see its contents, you do $("li:contains('Test')").html(); to see all it html or alert .length to see how many it matched
[02:03:50] <yurakeshi> MarkTheMark, don't need to repeat that soon, it's on the screen mate, sooner or later somebody will see it
[02:04:50] <MarkTheMark> ah yep
[02:04:52] <ElGatoSaez> ohhhh great yurakeshi
[02:04:54] <ElGatoSaez>  thanks thanks
[02:05:00] <MarkTheMark> judging by your name, you are Japanese?
[02:05:11] <ElGatoSaez> no I'm from Chile
[02:05:22] <MarkTheMark> not you.
[02:05:23] <MarkTheMark> :)
[02:05:30] <yurakeshi> no, nicks doesn't mean much, I'm just a fan of animes
[02:05:44] <MarkTheMark> i figured that too
[02:05:45] <MarkTheMark> :p
[02:06:17] <yurakeshi> MarkTheMark, you want that popup rolling selector box?
[02:06:37] <MarkTheMark> no.
[02:06:43] <MarkTheMark> just the list that has similar effect
[02:07:16] <yurakeshi> what effect? the glow one?
[02:07:46] <MarkTheMark> um no
[02:07:49] <MarkTheMark> the 3d effect as well as
[02:07:58] <MarkTheMark> the center being a little magnified
[02:10:45] <yurakeshi> MarkTheMark, https://code.google.com/archive/p/mobiscroll/
[02:10:51] <yurakeshi> on the test page select IOS theme
[02:11:31] <yurakeshi> the 3d effect is not jquery, it's just css
[02:13:08] <MarkTheMark> yurakeshi: im not seeing anything on the link
[02:13:54] <yurakeshi> you need to download the last version and open the demo index
[02:14:04] <yurakeshi> https://code.google.com/archive/p/mobiscroll/downloads
[02:14:12] <ElGatoSaez> mobiscroll
[02:14:13] <ElGatoSaez> ?
[02:15:21] <yurakeshi> ElGatoSaez, it's a plugin that makes what I think MarkTheMark wants
[02:15:30] <ElGatoSaez> ok
[02:18:23] <MarkTheMark> thanks for that. somewhat similar but not quite.

[03:32:18] <rollingWolf> Hmm, why the heck cant I remove disable'd attribute with prop('disabled', false); ? prop('disabled', true); sets the disabled attribute just fine
[03:35:05] <systemfault> Attributes and properties are two different things, use props whenever possible because it's the actual DOM properties of a node.
[03:35:54] <systemfault> Most properties and attributes are somewhat linked together (changing prop will change the corresponding attribute) but it's not guaranteed.
[03:36:03] <rollingWolf> systemfault, Right, but I do use .prop() as stated in the api :/
[03:36:33] <systemfault> rollingWolf: .prop('disabled', true or false) should work.
[03:36:48] <systemfault> Look at the result on the screen, not the value of the attribute to know if it worked.
[03:37:19] <rollingWolf> systemfault, It sets disabled just fine, its the removing the disabled property that dont work :P the submit button is still disabled
[03:37:29] <systemfault> If you really want to go the "attribute route", you need to do .attr('disabled', 'disabled') to add and .removeAttr('disabled') to remove.
[03:37:45] <rollingWolf> systemfault, Who said I want to use .attr?
[03:37:55] <systemfault> rollingWolf: That's not normal, doing .prop('disabled', false) should enable the button.
[03:38:06] <GnaGni> how can help me?
[03:38:24] <rollingWolf> systemfault, I know :/ the button is grayed out, cant see any errors in the console
[03:38:37] <rollingWolf> same selector
[03:39:14] <systemfault> Hmm if you select the button node in the inspector then open the console and write $0.disabled; then press enter, what do you get?
[03:39:33] <rollingWolf> I tried usign [type="submit"] as selector to no awail
[03:39:36] <rollingWolf> systemfault, Let me check
[03:40:04] <rollingWolf> systemfault, True
[03:40:08] <rollingWolf> well, lowercase
[03:40:11] <systemfault> Then it's disabled
[03:40:12] <systemfault> hmm
[03:40:24] <rollingWolf> Im running latest stable chrome
[03:40:27] <rollingWolf> This is so weird
[03:40:32] <systemfault> There's something weird in your code that doesn't reenable it :/
[03:41:54] <rollingWolf> systemfault, Sorry for bothering you . . I just realized that I was in completely wrong if () { enable here } else { disablehere } statement
[03:42:08] <rollingWolf> >_<
[03:42:15] * rollingWolf blames monday and not enough coffee
[04:22:48] <m_fulder> hey, I've encountered a really weird bug while developing a page and using jquery. I'm doing an ajax call to a php script which returns some CSS data. I then want to use this data with jquery to change some styling of my html components. The weird thing is that this works as intended the majority of times but sometimes it seems to fail and my componens are not updated. I've been trying to debug this for a long time and I can see th
[04:23:02] <m_fulder> yet the html objects are not updated. Have anyone encountered something similiar?
[04:35:09] <m_fulder> here's a simplified version of my code: http://pastebin.com/2bBTYVXv  while switching between small/medium sizes in my code it works the majority of time but sometimes the width is not changed although the console prints a new size value. How can this be? :o
[04:43:09] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I have 3 checkboxes and when one is changed I want to verify if all 3 alre checked and show something otherwise hide
[04:47:15] <m_fulder> PCatinean: Im a bit new to jquery but couldn't you just make change function for all of your checkboxes and then insode of it just check the .checked attribute of each box?
[04:47:35] <yurakeshi> PCatinean :  if ( $("input.checkbox_class:checked").length === 3 ) { // all checked }
[04:48:08] <m_fulder> ^ yeah that's way smarter :D
[04:50:20] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, i think you should specify the size unit, like $(".poster_image").width(sizes["img_width"] + 'px')
[04:51:42] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: hm I could add that, but the weird thing is the code works properly some times but other it fails to update the new fetched value
[04:55:11] <yurakeshi> does it throw any errors? how do you know it's not being updated? you can log $(".poster_image").width() after to see what happened.
[04:55:46] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: I don't get any errors, I've only printed the size before, will try to print width now too good idea
[04:56:58] <yurakeshi> does the style of the element change because of something else? I.E: Was block and latter inline? This kind of thing can affect sizing also
[04:57:58] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: hm it shouldn't change because of something else, at least not in this scenario.
[04:58:09] <yurakeshi> i always like to print width, padding, margin, borders, display to see what's really happening
[04:59:37] <m_fulder> its so hard to debug this too cause it only happens some times, I really don't know when. Just keep spamming and waiting for it to occur :P I printed the width after changing it now and the console shows the new changed value but I can not see the change visually :S
[05:00:23] <yurakeshi> are you sure you're watching the right element? lol
[05:00:36] <yurakeshi> select it on developer tools and check it out
[05:01:06] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: yeah pretty sure Im watching the correct once. They are changed correctly mostly after all, just in like 1/30 times it failes to change :S
[05:01:57] <yurakeshi> anyway those changes could overlap one another?
[05:02:39] <yurakeshi> after the console prints the new value, how is the element on the developer tools?
[05:02:53] <yurakeshi> take a look at the 'box model' tab
[05:04:27] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: I am checking the source code and console outputs in the chrome devloper tools. The last console print I've got is the width of my poster_col class and it shows 165 although the element itself had a width of 130 :S no idea why
[05:05:24] <yurakeshi> how about border, padding and box-sizing?
[05:05:39] <yurakeshi> can you make an fiddle with it?
[05:05:44] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: you mean the changes in different ajax calls could overlap each other? Oh wait because they are not done synchron maybe some of the ajax call takes longer time then another and then overlaps?
[05:06:04] <codecutter> given following sample array, need to sort by elements based on asc/desc, is there any libs out there (do I need a lib?) - ['+0.20', '-0.10', '+0.01', '-0.04']
[05:06:21] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: I could try making a fiddle hmm
[05:06:53] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, yes, that could happen... put a sort of ID counter on the request/response to see the order they're being executed
[05:07:23] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: yeah I will try that first before fiddeling :P
[05:08:27] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: but wait, shouldn't the console printouts be printed in the success ajax order as well? cause right now they seem to be executed in the correct order that I trigger them
[05:09:05] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: I do a console.log inside of the ajax->success. So it should be after the ajax call?
[05:09:58] <yurakeshi> yes... if you're sure the order is correct, no need to do it
[05:10:09] <yurakeshi> i just prefer to have it shown to me =)
[05:10:31] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: yeah Im pretty sure, hm gonna try making a fiddle out of this then ^^
[05:13:41] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, always good ^^
[05:27:41] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: hm I dunno how to add proper ajax call in fiddle :o should I call an external php file or simulate the return? Don't know if the performance will be much alike my actuall script now :P
[05:29:36] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, you can just use an seTimeout to emulate an ajax call
[05:29:58] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: aha yeah true that :P
[05:33:13] <yurakeshi> codecutter, https://jsfiddle.net/zuvfgp55/
[05:35:20] <codecutter> solved but thx
[05:35:23] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: um dunno if this is much alike my code now at all but I have something like this :P https://jsfiddle.net/yu0yf1zg/
[05:35:44] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, does it crash?
[05:36:14] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: it's much slower then my actuall ajax calls but it doesn't seem to crash :(
[05:37:12] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, let me ask... why use an ajax request to get the img size? Can't you use the value from the loaded data?
[05:40:04] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: I wanted the posters to be resizable by the user and changed without reloadning the page. So it is NOT only to show the size once, but it can be changed (and automatically saved for future site loads) many times.
[05:41:28] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: so its like a personal styling option for the user :P
[05:41:51] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, this doesn't crash: https://jsfiddle.net/yu0yf1zg/3/
[05:42:03] <yurakeshi> not on my ff at least
[05:43:46] <yurakeshi> m_fulder, nor do this btw: https://jsfiddle.net/yu0yf1zg/4/
[05:44:08] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: yeah I can see it doesnt, damnit and this is so close to my actuall code. The only extra thing I have is a second ajax call after the resizing saving the new value inside of my database, but that shouldn't matter much either? Or maybe these two ajax calls somehow got sync problem or something
[05:44:45] <yurakeshi> probably not
[05:44:54] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: hm nope, fiddle seems to work without crashing for me too
[05:45:21] <yurakeshi> how many .poster_image do u have?
[05:45:44] <yurakeshi> it's a simple selector as that?
[05:46:02] <m_fulder> I have 91 of them
[05:46:20] <yurakeshi> and you change all them at the same time?
[05:46:22] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: yeah its exactly like that
[05:46:29] <m_fulder> yeah every one of them
[05:46:40] <yurakeshi> an ajax call for each one or one call for all?
[05:46:47] <m_fulder> one call for all
[05:49:30] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: oh damn I think I found the error
[05:50:03] <lowbro> kill it with fire
[05:50:09] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: the sizes are changed before, I answered wrong before, I was looking at the wrong function -_-
[05:50:27] <m_fulder> lowbro: fire could work :P
[05:51:03] <yurakeshi> it happens ^^
[05:51:27] <yurakeshi> good luck
[05:51:29] <yurakeshi> gonna sleep mates, seeya
[05:51:38] <m_fulder> yurakeshi: thanks, and thanks for your help :P
[05:51:43] <m_fulder> yurakeshi:  sleep well ;)
[05:51:58] <yurakeshi> tnks
[05:56:30] <codecutter> why does this str comparison fail (line 2) http://pastebin.com/x8Edx8MR
[05:57:32] <codecutter> its not a number ticker.symbol contains A-Za-z chars only
[06:02:45] <shoky> codecutter: str-str equals NaN.. you need to either compare them with < or > and return 1 or -1 or 0,  or you can return a.symbol.localeCompare(b.symbol)
[06:03:28] <codecutter> what does localeCompare stand for?
[06:07:55] <shoky> what do you mean stand for?  it compares strings  https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare

[07:27:57] <mauzilla> Hi all! I'm trying to incorporate bootstrapwizard within a wizard form. The onNext method is used for all processing during the next button click. I have an ajax call which will validate some fields so need to the method to wait until the ajax call is in place. I am trying to incorporate a promise (brand new to me) but it's not working, anyone happy to have a look for me? https://jsfiddle.net/ohxwqLw7/
[07:29:36] <mauzilla> https://jsfiddle.net/ohxwqLw7/1/ (updated the code a bit)
[07:34:28] <shoky> mauzilla:  that's not how you use .done() .. also $.ajax already returns a promise, don't really see why you need to make your own here
[07:35:08] <shoky> anyway .done is used like this:    promise.done(function(data) { ... this gets executed when the promise is resolved ...  })
[07:35:49] <shoky> why not just do whatever you need to do in the success callback?
[07:35:58] <mauzilla> Hi shoky: i've tried a couple of iterations so welcome your feedback :)
[07:36:14] <shoky> just do what you need to do in the success callback :)
[07:36:53] <mauzilla> i have not found a way to do it within the success callback. I dont know if the plugin actually has a method to trigger the onNext
[07:37:06] <mauzilla> there is a next() method within the source code but that does not appear to work
[07:37:20] <shoky> there is nothing i can do with "does not appear to work"
[07:37:21] <mauzilla> i tried wizard.next() from within the onNext but no luck
[07:37:25] <shoky> make a jsfiddle demonstrating the issue
[07:37:32] <mauzilla> 2mins
[07:37:46] <shoky> (and i mean a working jsfiddle, not just the js code)
[07:38:45] <mauzilla> including the wizard html?
[07:38:48] <shoky> in any case,  adding promises doesn't solve problems like plugins not having a method to do something
[07:39:06] <shoky> including whatever is needed so that i can actually see the result
[07:39:26] <shoky> and see that calling next is not working
[07:40:48] <mauzilla> im not sure how I will show you the output of the ajax (which is required to demostrate the issue
[07:41:06] <shoky> var data = ...;
[07:41:38] <shoky> you can simulate the async with a setTimeout if you want
[07:44:43] <mauzilla> https://jsfiddle.net/ohxwqLw7/2/
[07:44:49] <mauzilla> just looking at a way to get the data in correctly
[07:45:14] <shoky> might also want to include the library ;p
[07:45:42] <mauzilla> well played :D
[07:45:52] <shoky> anyway
[07:46:02] <shoky> they give you an example of how to call methods
[07:46:21] <shoky> you're not doing it like in their example/docs
[07:46:33] <mauzilla> url?
[07:46:46] <shoky> https://github.com/VinceG/twitter-bootstrap-wizard#code-examples
[07:46:55] <mauzilla> i actually ahd a look at the docs but could not find the ajax working model
[07:50:03] <mauzilla> got it
[07:50:10] <mauzilla> helps reading the docs :D
[07:50:13] <mauzilla> thanks shoky
[07:50:15] <shoky> ;]
[07:50:35] <mauzilla> 2 days
[07:50:37] <mauzilla> i swear
[07:50:44] <mauzilla> iv'e actually considered doing this by hand
[07:51:12] <mauzilla> i've*
[07:51:26] <shoky> docs are the most important thing when you're using a library
[07:52:01] <shoky> no guesswork should come into it :)
[07:52:15] <mauzilla> i've visited the main website which contains very little working docs http://vinceg.github.io/twitter-bootstrap-wizard
[07:52:30] <mauzilla> but it's resolved :)
[07:52:32] <mauzilla> thats all that counts
[07:52:46] <mauzilla> on to the next step :D
[07:54:03] <shoky> if you think that's all the docs a library has, then you shouldn't be using that library :)
[07:54:15] <shoky> again, docs are the most important thing
[08:41:52] <makinen> ; $( 'tr[id^="autorefr\\:OD\\:[0-9]*"]')
[08:42:04] <makinen> what's wrong with this selector?
[08:43:06] <makinen> $( 'tr[id^="autorefr\\:OD\\:0"]') selects the first tr just fine but the regexp for all the tr elements doesn't work
[08:43:15] <shoky> selectors are not regex ...
[08:43:26] <makinen> oh okay
[08:45:37] <decx> hehe
[08:53:48] <makinen> $(':regex(id,autorefr\\:OD\\:0')) work neither :(
[08:56:27] <makinen> :(
[08:57:32] <_August_> can someone tell me why my the data in my 2nd each loop keeps repeating within my ul list when they should only be appending once to the div? https://jsfiddle.net/onsowxmk/2/
[08:59:23] <shoky> makinen: there is no such selector :regex ...
[09:00:24] <makinen> oh it has been removed, hasn't it
[09:00:27] <_August_> suggestions anyone?
[09:00:43] <shoky> makinen i don't think there ever was one
[09:00:54] <shoky> maybe you were looking at some plugin or something
[09:00:57] <makinen> there was a question about :regex on SO five years ago
[09:01:03] <shoky> so?
[09:01:15] <makinen> stack overflow
[09:01:19] <shoky> SO has nothing to do with jquery
[09:01:28] <shoky> it's random people on the internets

[09:04:42] <Krisostoomus> I have a problem with datetimepicker. My code: jQuery('#date1').datetimepicker({format: 'Y-m-d H:i:00'}); . When I set into the field some other value by copy and paste, then some other value gets put to the input field. When the format is Y-m-d H:i:s, then there's no problem, but I want that the seconds and minutes would always be 00 by default.

[09:07:26] <shoky> _August_: after you added the first ul, and then the 2nd ul. when you append to the 2nd ul, it also appends the same thing (cloned) to the 1st ul
[09:07:44] <_August_> those set of items should go into the ul's everytime it looks by each set should only go into once
[09:07:51] <shoky> _August_: this has nothing to do with the data, it has to do with you selecting ALL uls that exist, and appending the same thing to ALL of them
[09:08:29] <_August_> actually im not selecting all the urls
[09:08:49] <shoky> _August_: $('.panel-collapse ul')   selects all such <ul>s that currently exist in the DOM
[09:08:57] <_August_> ohhh
[09:09:16] <shoky> use variables
[09:09:22] <shoky> var ul = $('<ul>');
[09:09:29] <shoky> ul.append(whatever)
[09:09:33] <_August_> there we go
[09:09:37] <_August_> thanks
[09:09:39] <shoky> sure
[09:09:47] <_August_> completely missed that
[09:13:07] <Krisostoomus> hi i am still struggling with the problem.
[09:15:45] <Krisostoomus> is the following format allowed in datetimepicker format: 'Y-m-d H:00:00' ?
[09:28:12] <Krisostoomus> I have a problem with datetimepicker. My code: jQuery('#date1').datetimepicker({format: 'Y-m-d H:00:00'}); . When I set into the field some other value by copy and paste, then some other value gets put to the input field. When the format is Y-m-d H:i:s, then there's no problem, but I want that the seconds and minutes would always be 00 by default.
[10:06:58] <jimduchek> Hi.  In jquery mobile, if I do a selector like 'div[data-role="header"]' it looks like it returns _all_ the headers in the history.. Is there an easier way to select only the one on the current 'page' than looping through and checking for visibility?
[10:13:48] <shoky> jimduchek: you can get the current page with  $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer("getActivePage")
[10:16:09] <chealey> I have a page with words such as 'hello world' repeated over and over again. I separated each letter into a div so that i can control them individually, apply classes, etc. What i need to do is on page load start a 'change text color' animation targeting certain letters 1 at a time 'till a word is formed' and then fade all out, and move on and do the same thing for another word, so on and so forth, and cycle back. Anybody able to give me a ha
[10:16:09] <chealey> nd i'm so lost as to how to acomplish this..
[10:18:17] <decx> use typed.js or something like that chealey
[10:18:53] <decx> it's not that complex to write but if you're lost already then a ready and done plugin might be better for you
[10:19:07] <chealey> @decx that doesn't really do what i want.
[10:19:23] <chealey> I'm not an idiot but i don't really know what im doing if i had a hand i could wrap my head around it im sure.
[10:25:45] <arc_> chealey http://tuxsudo.com/code/project/letterfx#lfx_fx 'fade'
[10:26:31] <chealey> @arc_ still not quite what i need i don't think, take a look at this url http://www.conan.com.php56-18.dfw3-1.websitetestlink.com/
[10:27:02] <chealey> As you can see from that page, right now 'via css in the yellow, jquery in blue' a word fades in 'the css fades back out the jquery does not cause i don't know how'
[10:27:16] <chealey> That should give you a bit of a better idea of what it is i'm trying to acomplish
[10:28:03] <chealey> 1 letter at a time change color from black to blue till a word is formed '3 words in total', then all the letters of that word change back to black at the same time. Then the next word begins with 1 letter at a time.
[10:29:09] <arc_> well, each letter is in its own div, but you assigned them all a class and you're animating based on the class
[10:29:13] <arc_> so you're animating everything at once
[10:29:33] <chealey> right i understand that i should assign them each their own class of course, or an additional class to each one.
[10:30:06] <arc_> not necessarily. there are ways to do it programmatically
[10:30:22] <chealey> im not aware of them but if you could tell me how that'd be super appreciated.
[10:31:05] <arc_> animation and timing aren't things i'm really familiar with in javascript unfortunately
[10:31:43] <chealey> I'm not sure you even need to be for this, it's such a basic function im just an ignoramous
[10:38:47] <hd1> I'm loading a page using $.get... is jquery carried over, or do I need to inject the script tag in the new page?
[10:45:30] <Velveeta> hd1: if you're loading via $.get and just injecting consumable html into your existing page, you should still have access to jquery, provided it's loaded in your head
[11:37:08] <VectorX> with these two links, what is the fastest way to make the variables 0 if the objects are undefined, https://jsfiddle.net/qnkoucmu/
[11:37:33] <VectorX> s/these two links/these two assignments/
[11:37:33] <b-ot> Correction, <VectorX> with these two assignments, what is the fastest way to make the variables 0 if the objects are undefined, https://jsfiddle.net/qnkoucmu/
[11:39:40] <Velveeta> vectorx: i would just add: || 0 after your calls to data
[11:42:18] <VectorX> thanks Velveeta that worked great
[11:43:54] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[12:33:44] <VectorX> if there a way to better write this, im getting a error when the object for .match is undefined, var filter_type = $('.type-filter').eq(0).val().match(/\d+/)[0] || 0;
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> .val() will automatically retrieve the first one, so you don't need that .eq(0)
[12:34:40] <robertmaxrees> and I'd use a ternary here with some slightly different formatting.
[12:38:33] <Velveeta> yeah, i'd break it up into multiple statements myself
[12:38:40] <Velveeta> heya robertmaxrees
[12:38:45] <robertmaxrees> good morning!

[12:43:08] <VectorX> Velveeta ok wasnt sure if there was a quick way instead of testing the object with a if
[12:43:22] <robertmaxrees> VectorX you don't need an if at all.
[12:43:35] <robertmaxrees> you just need to break it down into a few different discrete operations.
[12:44:00] <Velveeta> yeah, you can do it in a single statement and a ternary, but not without repeating the regex
[12:44:11] <Velveeta> so i'd just have the regex assignment first, and then a 2nd statement with a ternary
[12:51:09] <VectorX> so i got it working, but Velveeta i am confused about your mentioned about the regex assignment first, should this be modified differently, var filter_type = $('.type-filter').eq(0).val() ? $('.type-filter').eq(0).val().match(/\d+/)[0] : 0;
[12:52:06] <robertmaxrees> VectorX you don't need the .eq(0).
[12:52:23] <VectorX> yeah, i chucked that in there just to make sure i wasnt missing anything
[12:52:28] <robertmaxrees> you wan't.
[12:52:32] <robertmaxrees> *aren't.
[12:52:41] <VectorX> .val() i can get rid of
[12:52:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> you need the .val()
[12:53:14] <VectorX> ok ill leave it as it is then, but still not sure about thre regex first part
[12:53:50] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/2b0e1c8e9301
[12:53:55] <Velveeta> and i mean i would do var filter_type = $('.type-filter').val().match(/\d+/); filter_type = filter_type[0] || 0;
[12:53:56] <robertmaxrees> could do somethoing like this.
[12:54:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:54:09] <robertmaxrees> same diff
[12:54:44] <Velveeta> actually robert's is safer, because if that regex doesn't match, it'll return null as opposed to an empty object/array
[12:54:59] <Velveeta> so dereferencing [0] would actually throw instead of just short circuiting
[12:55:42] <VectorX> nice
[12:59:34] <VectorX> got a sort of off topic question, this is to do with the mixit-up plugin, on the blue sidebar, if you dropdown and click the months the content filters, but if you do it too fast it stops working, i cant seem to see why it would do that, the content is output in the html http://bit.ly/29P3KDJ
[13:00:17] <VectorX> you can double click the same month to replicate
[13:00:17] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet the ajax is busted when you go too quickly.
[13:01:01] <robertmaxrees> probably an element that you assume exists via the ajax call that gets removed in one of those callbacks.
[13:07:44] <VectorX> found a similar issue, https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/support/topic/append-filtering-not-working/  not sure how to implement the callback but ill keep reading
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> how was everybody's weekend?
[13:24:45] <Velveeta> mine was grrrrrreat
[13:24:56] <VectorX> mine was ok
[13:25:18] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta very oddly enough, you came up in conversation.  you have an ice sphere maker, yeah?
[13:25:30] <Velveeta> yepyep
[13:25:34] <robertmaxrees> where'd you get it?
[13:25:36] <Velveeta> from wintersmiths i believe
[13:25:49] <Velveeta> this one: http://www.wintersmiths.com/products/ice-chest?variant=929663197
[13:25:56] <robertmaxrees> rad.  thank you.
[13:26:00] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[14:25:17] <BetaFrey> I am trying to write some jquery so that when my asp.net page reloads on button clicks it either keeps an accordion open or closed based on what it was before the page reload event but I am having trouble telling if my hidden field value is ever getting switched.  Within my .net application i'm always getting undefined for the variable in console,
[14:25:18] <BetaFrey> any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/0wpjtqjv/
[14:25:55] <robertmaxrees> so what's <%=hfAccordian.ClientID %> getting set to?
[14:26:03] <robertmaxrees> javascript can't read your backend.
[14:27:17] <BetaFrey> i'm trying to set the value to 0 or 1 with  the(  '#<%=hfAccordian.ClientID%>').val('');
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:28:32] <robertmaxrees> so what is <%=hfAccordian.ClientID%> outputting as?
[14:28:58] <BetaFrey> without the .val it outputs as some objects with .val it outputs undefined.
[14:29:08] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:29:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> i mean the actual string getting rendered into the page.
[14:29:19] <robertmaxrees> not the console.
[14:31:25] <BetaFrey> I don't know the field is hidden it doesnt render anything on the page :x  I was trying to do something like  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2137778/how-to-fill-asp-net-hidden-field-with-jquery
[14:31:35] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:31:39] <robertmaxrees> so is this in a .js file?
[14:31:56] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about how javascript works :)
[14:32:21] <robertmaxrees> fwiw "render" in this case means "the code getting output by the server"
[14:32:27] <BetaFrey> i'm adding a <script></script> to my aspx page
[14:32:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so look at the page source in the browser - what does it look like there?
[14:33:06] <robertmaxrees> the actual JS is what I care about - the stuff that actually gets output.
[14:34:43] <BetaFrey> robertmaxrees:  in the f12  explorer?
[14:34:47] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:37:42] <BetaFrey> I don't know I'm confused
[14:39:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:39:33] <robertmaxrees> so jquery isn't selecting $("<%=hfAccordian.ClientID %>") - <%=hfAccordian.ClientID %> is being replaced with a value by your server when the page gets sent out.
[14:39:48] <BetaFrey> I can't even find it
[14:40:13] <BetaFrey> it outputs the console logs but in the explorer I cant find the script at all?
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> then it's there.
[14:41:49] <BetaFrey> i think I found it one second.
[14:42:42] <BetaFrey> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8369ef269332372bd8f9ede2a22ddc2d is this what you meant?
[14:42:56] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:43:01] <robertmaxrees> and there's your first problem.
[14:43:06] <robertmaxrees> $("MCCContent_hfAccordian")
[14:43:27] <robertmaxrees> that's looking for an element <MCCContent_hfAccordian>
[14:45:05] <BetaFrey> instead of an ID with that name?
[14:47:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:47:07] <robertmaxrees> needs a # in front it.
[14:49:42] <BetaFrey> =x
[14:51:50] <robertmaxrees> literally just need to slap a # in there.
[14:52:03] <robertmaxrees> $('#<%=hfAccordian.ClientID %>')
[14:52:41] <BetaFrey> Now it works I cant' believe literally thats it?
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> what don't you believe?
[14:54:38] <BetaFrey> I don't believe that 1. what I wrote would work between page loads as is (with the #) and 2. I can't believe that I couldnt figure out that i neeeded a # to get to my stuff ? -- I thought I would still need to fiddle with it more once I was able to see what results the hfAccordian was giving. Probably should fix that typo too.
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> ah.  just surprised it was that easy :)
[14:56:33] <BetaFrey> I have been sitting here for like 4 hours trying to get the variables to not return undefined so yeah shocked i didnt have a lot of more issues, given that I obviously don't understand what I was doing very well. I appreciate the help.
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[14:56:55] <robertmaxrees> check this out when you have some time.
[14:57:10] <robertmaxrees> good read-through.  also a good general reference with a lot of basics.
[14:58:35] <BetaFrey> For some reason I was thinking that the # was like to bind in aspx  but it makes sense since all the other ID's have a # to use it, I guess I also thought the <%= took care of that. yeah i have a lot to learn. thanks again.
[14:58:50] <robertmaxrees> just like CSS.
[14:58:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:59:09] <robertmaxrees> this is part of why most people would suggest that you not generate code for one language with another.
[14:59:43] <BetaFrey> I didnt know how else to get my accordion to remain open or closed on postbacks :X
[15:00:07] <robertmaxrees> either swap to ajax or, even better, why do you need a dynamic ID like that?
[15:02:40] <BetaFrey> I suppose I don't need a dynamic ID? I just didnt know how to get at my asp elements and how to retain the stuff between the page loads and in the past have mostly only done it that way. bottom line inexperience and not knowing the best method is why I did it the way i did xd?
[15:03:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd learn to use ajax tbh.
[15:13:10] <mekeor> is it possible to use several jquery-selectors at once?
[15:13:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[15:13:21] <mekeor> e.g., i have:    $("h1").addClass(c); $("h2").addClass(c); $("h3").addClass(c);
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> just like you would in css.
[15:13:32] <robertmaxrees> $('h1, h2, h3');
[15:13:42] <mekeor> perfect, cool, thanks, robertmaxrees :)
[15:14:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:19:07] <nahtnam> Hey! I imported jquery into my site by adding this: <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"></script> to the bottom but in the console I see `$ is not defined`
[15:19:13] <nahtnam> Any idea what might be causing this?
[15:19:34] <nahtnam> My code is inside this: `$(document).ready(function () {`
[15:22:20] <graphettion> nahtnam, is it before the </body> tag and before scripts you have in jquery?
[15:23:42] <nahtnam> graphettion: Yes, it kinda looks like this: https://gist.github.com/nahtnam/d97c69e54240d7a80b95cb9c3d61175b
[15:24:19] <graphettion> that's why
[15:24:24] <graphettion> move your <script>
[15:24:28] <graphettion> under jquery
[15:25:27] <graphettion> I would recommend using an external file unless you are limited to <script>
[15:27:28] <nahtnam> Thanks @graphettion
[15:27:39] <graphettion> np
[15:29:56] <nahtnam> One more question. Is it possible to live update the value of a div when the value of an input changes?
[15:30:02] <nahtnam> This is as close as I got: $("#username").on("change keyup paste", function() {
[15:30:18] <nahtnam> But when you hold a key down, it doesnt update until you let go of the key
[15:32:36] <nahtnam> Looks like .on("input" did the trick
[15:33:05] <jimi_> without using regex or a return function is there a selected for case insensitivity like find input fields with value of "no" "No" or "NO" etc ?
[15:35:12] <robertmaxrees> jimi_ i'd use .filter() with a function tbh.
[15:35:29] <jimi_> ty
[15:35:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you wind up with some unreadable funk.
[16:19:51] <regedit> hello
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[16:20:09] <regedit> i have a URL-encoded string, is there any way to process it through serializeArray() ?
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:20:52] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.serializeArray is for a set of form elements.
[16:21:01] <regedit> i.o.w. I have only the results of .serialze() without the original form controls, any hope of getting it to .serializeArray() ?
[16:21:05] <regedit> argh...
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> you can easily do that yourself.
[16:21:47] <regedit> i prolly can, sounds fun
[16:21:57] <regedit> but i'm lazy and i want something robust and already existing
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> heh, doesn't really exist.
[16:22:24] <regedit> that's my arrangement with the internet these days - i wish for something to exist, i google it, and alas - it exists
[16:22:34] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:24:59] <regedit> getting started https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/get-query-params-object/
[16:25:04] <regedit> you can do better than that internet....come on....
[16:28:51] <decx> deparam
[16:29:30] <regedit> hmmmmm https://gist.github.com/kares/956897#gistcomment-1190642
[16:29:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:29:55] <robertmaxrees> coulda been done at this point but (shrug)
[16:30:27] <regedit> http://locutus.io/php/strings/parse_str/
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[16:31:17] <regedit> robertmaxrees: have your shoulders reached your earlobes yet?
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> i dunno, you proved your point yet? ;)
[17:09:28] <int-main> https://jsfiddle.net/imxdn/cwbb7vjc/
[17:09:34] <int-main> Am I using delay wrong?
[17:13:31] <Velveeta> delay is used to process queues, it's not a generic timeout function
[17:16:48] <int-main> Velveeta: so i am restricted to setTimeout()?
[17:17:33] <Velveeta> i mean, you could roll your own jquery plugin that offered that same kind of chainable functionality, but i don't think there's a standard jquery function for it
[17:34:16] <Captain_Ramius> Sweet! There's a Freenode channel for everything!
[17:34:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:34:55] <Captain_Ramius> I have AJAX issues. Is the order of AJAX parameters strict?
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:35:33] <robertmaxrees> are you passing a settings object?
[17:35:46] <Captain_Ramius> does it matter if it's "type, url, dataType" or "url, type, dataType"?
[17:35:55] <Captain_Ramius> Uhhh...I think so.
[17:36:05] <robertmaxrees> lol show me what you're doing :)
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> bpaste.net
[17:36:13] <Captain_Ramius> $.ajax({type, url, etc.});
[17:36:49] <Captain_Ramius> Don't laugh: http://pastebin.com/BXhU4J2A
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's using an object.  order is totally irrelevant - it's looking for the key names.
[17:37:38] <robertmaxrees> order is only important when talking about arrays or function arguments.
[17:38:10] <robertmaxrees> also, you wnat failure: function(response) {}
[17:38:41] <robertmaxrees> except there is no "failure" option ;)
[17:38:54] <csplugins> What is the difference between these three selectors: $("element1 element2")  $("element1 > element2")  $("element1, element2")
[17:39:20] <Captain_Ramius> I see on an example "error:". Is that right?
[17:39:25] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius yep.
[17:39:44] <robertmaxrees> csplugins $("element1 element2")  means "get me all descendents of element1 that match element2".
[17:39:55] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: what's  .submit('submit', ...  ?
[17:40:02] <robertmaxrees> $("element1 > element2") means "get me all direct children of element1 that match element2
[17:40:07] <Captain_Ramius> Hmmm, I'm getting a quick flash of a GET error in my console but then it blanks out. Why?
[17:40:26] <Captain_Ramius> shoky: when my html form is submitted
[17:40:33] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: .submit('submit'  is wrong  and also maybe you want to prevent the form submit with e.preventDefault()
[17:40:33] <robertmaxrees> and $("element1, element2") means "get me all elements that match element1 and elemenent2"
[17:40:45] <shoky> Captain_Ramius:   you want .submit(function..  or .on('submit',  functoin...
[17:40:51] <shoky> Captain_Ramius: not  .submit('submit'   :)
[17:41:10] <Captain_Ramius> shoky: it was originally .on('submit', function)
[17:41:15] <shoky> good for it :)
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius then use that.
[17:41:30] <Captain_Ramius> Not sure why I changed it: I've spent a while trying to modfiy examples I found on jquery.com and SO.
[17:41:56] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius also: dataType: "html",   //expect html to be returned - jquery can usually figure this out for you.  it also assumes GET is the request typ.e
[17:42:47] <Captain_Ramius> Good to know. It was in the example, so I left it.
[17:43:02] <shoky> also for what you're doing in that paste there's a jquery shortcut -  $('#outputRow').load(fullUrl)
[17:43:08] <shoky> fyi
[17:43:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[17:44:02] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/e2a68f0e4e6b
[17:44:06] <Captain_Ramius> Ooooo! Shortcuts...
[17:44:14] <csplugins> $("#myCustomId ul li a").each(function () {   ...   So for this case, it is getting all of the ancors that aree inside list that are inside an unordered list that is inside myCustomId?
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> csplugins yep.
[17:44:28] <robertmaxrees> just like in CSS
[17:45:17] <csplugins> but since they are space separated, there can be a div surrounding the ul and it will still work?
[17:45:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:45:37] <csplugins> and if the direct '>' was used, the div cannot be present?
[17:45:42] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[17:46:10] <Captain_Ramius> I get a quick flash of a GET error in my console but then it blanks out. Do you know why?
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius are you using preventDefault() against the event object?
[17:46:38] <csplugins> okay then the comma separated looks for a single element with both attributes?
[17:46:44] <robertmaxrees> csplugins no.
[17:46:53] <robertmaxrees> csplugins it looks for any element that matches either selector.
[17:47:01] <csplugins> Oh okay.
[17:47:09] <robertmaxrees> so $('a, strong, b') would get all a tags, strong tags, and b tags.
[17:48:13] <csplugins> So space and '>' are cascaded and ',' is not. I think I got it. Thanks
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, space is just "all descendents" while > is "direct descendents"
[17:48:42] <Captain_Ramius> ARRRRRGHH! All that for the wrong directory!
[17:49:24] <robertmaxrees> haha
[17:49:27] <robertmaxrees> that happens all the time.
[17:49:41] <csplugins> And these can be combined? Like... $("ul > li, ol li")
[17:49:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:50:20] <csplugins> Alright, thanks for the clarification
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> just don't be afraid to use more semantic markup with classes/IDs when things start getting super complex.
[17:51:17] <csplugins> Because with that in mind it should never make sense to see $("some elements here #andAnId").each( ...
[17:51:33] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[17:52:17] <robertmaxrees> unless its placement in the structure is significant for some reason, but that's better determined by using a .closest() call with a .filter() or something.
[17:54:30] <csplugins> Okay, thanks again for the help! cya
[17:55:48] <kevireilly> Captain_Ramius: what you describe sounds like what happens when something bad happens before navigating away from the current page. While you may have already solved the problem, it is sometimes useful to be aware of the "Preserve log" option on the Network tab that will retain logs (including errors) across page loads
[17:56:24] <kevireilly> err on the Console tab (but also applies to the Network tab)
[18:07:32] <ckb> Hey guys, can I get the relative offset from the top of the element? I have a scrollable element, and I’m trying to figure out if I’ve scrolled past a child element
[18:09:52] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can't do that.  you can use https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/ and compare that against the top position of the element you care about.
[18:44:24] <Captain_Ramius> kevireilly, Thanks. I just noticed the Preserve Log checkbox but I didn't know if it was relevant. robertmaxrees 's suggestion to use preventDefault() stopped the vicious cycle.
