[01:18:34] <WhirledPress> hey all, anybody know of a quick way to log the type of element contained in a jquery object? I am trying to log "div" for example if it's a div, or "button" if it's a button.
[01:18:46] <WhirledPress> It's just for logging so it doesn't have to be accurate.
[01:18:53] <WhirledPress> *too accurate.
[01:27:51] <sonu_nk>  i was trying to capture screen using phantomjs but it seems its not giving me perfect screen shot..so i created issue here.. i have issue here https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/14883
[02:24:49] <Robdgreat> sonu_nk: this is #jquery
[02:25:38] <sonu_nk> Robdgreat, i know but there could be one who uses phantomjs very well..so just asked question.
[02:26:31] <Cork> sonu_nk: => #phantomjs
[02:26:40] <Cork> last i checked that channel was quite active
[02:26:59] <Robdgreat> Cork: it's far better just to pick a channel at random and ask questions into it
[02:27:05] <sonu_nk> Cork, i posted there.. but that room Ghost Room
[02:27:30] <Cork> sonu_nk: well it is where you are likely to get an answer at all on freenode
[02:27:39] <Cork> so keep asking or look for a forum or something like that
[02:28:01] <sonu_nk> Cork, yes tried
[04:03:33] <dglambert> yo
[05:31:16] <Koopz> https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data-ajax anyone using that? this plugin is driving me nuts
[05:34:21] <Koopz> i'm providing JSON data which's entries have id and text keys but shit just won't work. I don't get it... the dropdown list shows up, but clicking on an entry doesn't do anything... no hidden option to the underlying select has been added and that input type text doesn't have any value either
[05:34:44] <Koopz> crap used to work before 4.0 but now...
[06:10:23] <Whiskey> can anyone tell my whit this error? https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/25/
[06:10:43] <Whiskey> i get "val is undefined" all the time
[06:35:01] <codecutter> i have a list of string which contains a date in the the format 'yyyy-mm-d', how do sort this in desc order?
[06:35:33] <sonu_nk>   events.loaded = new Event('loaded'); just to confirm and want to know more  about this. is this will register a event means we can create own event ?
[06:37:17] <Whiskey> stupid JS
[06:57:06] <Cork> codecutter: .sort should be able to handle it as the structure is the right for that
[06:57:38] <Cork> sonu_nk: that create an event object, not an event
[06:57:50] <Cork> (the object you get in function(e) {}
[06:59:13] <Cork> Whiskey: where do you get the error (what line)
[06:59:17] <Cork> i get no error here
[07:04:06] <Whiskey> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/27/
[07:04:28] <Whiskey> its the "return this.values = val.split('\n');"
[07:04:53] <Whiskey> line 69
[07:05:36] <Cork> Whiskey: could you make the jsfiddle run that line?
[07:05:38] <Whiskey> html part 14-19
[07:05:45] <Whiskey> no
[07:05:55] <Whiskey> i get the error in fiddle also
[07:06:14] <Whiskey> ooo, you need to click "try an example " :d
[07:06:52] <Cork> ah, there we go
[07:07:00] <Whiskey> my fault sorry
[07:07:00] <Whiskey> :D
[07:07:58] <Cork> where is the even handler for example bound?
[07:08:21] <Whiskey> you mean line 241?
[07:08:42] <Cork> no that is a function declaration
[07:08:58] <Cork> when <a href="#" id="example"> is clicked where is the handler for that?
[07:09:55] <Cork> there it is
[07:10:39] <Whiskey> 219 ?
[07:11:35] <Whiskey> "$('#example').bind('click', this.loadExample);"
[07:12:36] <Cork> what is setting this.input?
[07:12:46] <Cork> cause that one is currently an empty collection
[07:13:12] <Whiskey> no clue problem is that i changed the orginal code
[07:13:33] <Whiskey> http://scriptular.com/ use same code
[07:14:08] <Cork> ya, too much code to dig through
[07:14:18] <Whiskey> but it has <div id="test_strings"><h2>Test Strings:</h2><textarea name="test_strings"></textarea></div>
[07:14:22] <Whiskey> insted of
[07:14:22] <Whiskey> <div id="test_string"><div id="inner_test_string_wrapper"><label for="test">Your test string:</label><textarea cols="56" id="test" name="test" rows="10" tabindex="3"></textarea></div></div>
[07:14:24] <Cork> you will have to look into where this.input comes from cause it is currently empty
[07:14:25] <Whiskey> thats the part that fail
[07:14:51] <Whiskey> and i don´t see really how it can fail
[07:15:23] <Whiskey> i also found that that this.input is empty :d
[07:15:54] <Cork> ya, and nothing ever seams to set it, so it is prob in one of the dependencies, like spine.js
[07:16:03] <Cork> but ya, you will have to dig into that you're self
[07:16:10] <Cork> *yourself
[07:16:57] <Whiskey> the thing is if i set <div id="test_strings"><h2>Test Strings:</h2><textarea name="test_strings"></textarea></div> insted it works
[07:17:48] <Cork> Whiskey: i think you should learn how the libs you depend on works instead of just hack at them
[07:18:38] <Whiskey> :P
[07:19:37] <Whiskey> i can´t really find in the js whats bind the <div id="test_strings"><h2>Test Strings:</h2><textarea name="test_strings"></textarea></div>
[07:19:55] <Whiskey> it has to be test_string and name="test_strings"
[07:20:30] <codecutter> Cork: if i need to sort a map by key (date), how would I do it?
[07:20:48] <Cork> uh, map?
[07:20:53] <Cork> whats a map?
[07:21:20] <codecutter> thats a java concept
[07:21:22] <Whiskey> only bind i can find is "$('textarea').val(test_strings.join('\n'));"
[07:21:25] <Whiskey> and its not empty
[07:21:42] <codecutter> hang let me get a pastebin show how data looks like
[07:21:42] <Cork> that isn't even a bind
[07:21:50] <codecutter> hang on*
[07:22:20] <Whiskey> well i don´t mean bind as bind, connect to whatever its called
[07:22:50] <codecutter> Cork: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/size
[07:23:12] <Cork> codecutter: are you sure it is one of those?
[07:23:18] <Cork> they are VERY unusual
[07:23:28] <Cork> and for example json doesn't support them
[07:23:31] <codecutter> yes
[07:23:38] <codecutter> really?
[07:23:45] <codecutter> let me run the app and check
[07:23:59] <Cork> what json supports are [] <-- array and {} <-- objects
[07:24:46] <Cork> map is for when you need to reference large sets of data like offsets in an iso or something like that
[07:25:35] <Cork> and as far as i know not much other then emscripten compiled programs use them (with a few exceptions)
[07:25:45] <codecutter> well, in my case i'm trying to display the data using highcharts with date (key)
[07:26:01] <Cork> ya, but i need to know what it is your working with
[07:26:21] <Cork> as it differers hugely if it is an array or object
[07:26:42] <codecutter> hang on, i'll get you a pastebin
[07:27:08] <codecutter> it may take a few mins becauase i have run the app
[07:27:50] <Whiskey> Strange that its so hard to find
[07:31:20] <Cork> Whiskey: look through the different files for a place that sets input property to a value
[07:32:59] <Whiskey> found it
[07:33:04] <Whiskey> lol, check the sepll next tiime
[07:35:43] <Whiskey> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/uva7a1oy/28/
[07:36:00] <Whiskey> so just the fun part left :D bbl :D
[08:12:51] <dglambert> yo
[09:10:23] <Anticom> Hi all. is there any difference between jqXHR.statusText and 2nd param in $.ajax().fail() callback?
[09:16:02] <Cork> Anticom: yes, it has nothing to do with each other
[09:16:15] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ check the error property section
[09:21:00] <Anticom> Cork: Well i got confused because it's templated in Typescripts .d.ts ;) Cheers
[09:22:29] <Anticom> Cork: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR statusText property isn't really documented
[09:22:54] <Cork> Anticom: ya, it is kinda infired to the error property
[09:23:06] <Cork> (same with success/done and complete/always
[09:23:10] <Cork> )
[09:23:16] <Anticom> Cork: is jqXHR simply forwarding XMLHttpRequest.statusText ?
[09:23:25] <Cork> no
[09:23:43] <Cork> ah, sorry
[09:23:45] <Anticom> Hm, well then i still don't get what it actually is i'm afraid :/
[09:23:53] <Cork> yes the jqxhr object is a wrapped xmlhttprequest object
[09:23:59] <Anticom> ah i see
[09:24:00] <Cork> with added deferred objects
[09:24:02] * Anticom 1UP
[09:24:12] <Anticom> yummy mushrooms :D
[09:24:16] <Anticom> thanks Cork
[09:24:22] <Cork> i thought you talked about the .fail/done/always callbacks :()
[09:24:26] <Cork> *:)
[09:24:47] <Anticom> Cork: yea i did, but 1st param of .fail() callback is *is* a jqXHR isn't it?
[09:24:57] <Cork> it is
[09:25:06] <Anticom> ok, then we're clear i think :)
[09:25:09] <Cork> yup
[09:25:31] <Anticom> So for an error message shown to the user 2nd param of fail() callback is probably more intuitive i suppose
[09:26:08] <Cork> no, that one is for programatic identifying of error class
[09:26:18] <Cork> it is normally very none descriptive
[09:26:45] <Cork> (the exact texts is listed in the place i talked about before)
[09:26:49] <Anticom> http://devdocs.io/dom/xmlhttprequest/statustext But XMLHttpRequest's statusText is even worse IMO
[09:27:11] <Cork> well i would make sure the server sent something useful
[09:27:13] <Cork> and use that
[09:27:20] <Cork> so xhr.reponseText
[09:27:27] <Anticom> Cork: it's legacy code with crude to none error handling at all
[09:27:32] <Anticom> have go fix it incrementally
[09:27:51] <Cork> then the best option might be to have a case class and add your own error messages
[09:28:20] <Anticom> Cork: error's are currently displayed by alerts scattered all over the place. I have to fix that first ;)
[09:34:27] <skywater> hi
[09:34:28] <skywater> if i have forms with id=¨form¨ and if i have 1 javascript file in which i react on the submit of the forms through that id name.. is it also possible that for example the first form does not gets executed by the submit function of javascript but just by the default way and just posts to the action which i set in the form?
[09:41:31] <Cork> skywater: uh, a bit jumbled question, but paraphrasing, yes an even callback can fire and still the form default submit action can happen
[09:41:51] <Cork> skywater: the event hander needs to do the event.preventDefault() call in the handler to prevent the default action
[09:42:12] <Cork> on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); })
[09:56:15] <DexDeadly> Anyone using modals and jquery to submit files and a form?
[10:57:21] <Anticom> DexDeadly: modals? are you talking about jq-ui modals?
[11:01:38] <Guest95782> Is there anyways I could get the same class tabs to work on the same page without affecting eachother? I tried using $(this) but that didnt seem to help: https://jsfiddle.net/ehcsdj0x/2/
[11:02:38] <d3m0n> Does anyone have an example of how to properly use hover/mouse events inside a plugin? ($.fn.plugin = function())
[11:03:51] <taplar> Guest95782: you have a couple unscoped lookups in your handler
[11:04:50] <bel3atar> when a $.ajax fails with a 404, does it call the fail() or the statusCode.404() or both?
[11:05:09] <taplar> both
[11:05:24] <bel3atar> ugh
[11:05:45] <Guest95782> Do you mean my variable isn't scoped?
[11:06:13] <taplar> Guest95782: line 6 and 7 are unscoped lookups
[11:08:44] <Guest95782> taplar: is this on the right track? https://jsfiddle.net/ehcsdj0x/4/
[11:09:20] <taplar> line 6 is still unscoped
[11:09:36] <taplar> you want these things to be self contained, right?
[11:10:07] <Guest95782> Yes, but I don't want to class out each one
[11:10:21] <taplar> so what is the containing element for each one?
[11:11:12] <Guest95782> .team-toggle?
[11:11:33] <taplar> team toggle contains everything related to each 'thing' ?
[11:11:34] <Anticom> d3m0n: afaik you usually use plugin-prefixed classes you apply to the elements you want to bind events to
[11:12:31] <Guest95782> oh, do you mean doing something like   li.current?
[11:12:44] <Anticom> Is it documented somewhere under what exact conditions jquery rejects defered in .ajax()? can't be bothered to dig through ajax.js myself :S
[11:12:56] <taplar> no, i'm talking about if you were to think of these things as objects.  what is the top most distinct parent of each object
[11:13:49] <Guest95782> .team-tabs
[11:14:09] <taplar> alright.  so -that- is the context in which you should consider doing any lookup against
[11:14:31] <taplar> so the result is always relative to the object you are working with
[11:23:33] <bel3atar> is the $.ajax done() callback only called if the status' response is 200?
[11:23:46] <taplar> 200-300 iirc
[11:24:22] <Guest95782> So I think i scoped it down right, but they still affect eachother
[11:24:24] <Guest95782> .contract-tabs-content
[11:24:30] <Guest95782> https://jsfiddle.net/ehcsdj0x/8/
[11:24:54] <taplar> line 6 and 7 are still unscoped lookups
[11:25:51] <Guest95782> even with the .team-tabs?
[11:26:01] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:26:26] <taplar> .team-tabs finds all team tabs on the page
[11:26:39] <taplar> you only want the one relative to the li you are handling the event for
[11:33:30] <Guest95782> So after taking a look at closest, i came up with this: https://jsfiddle.net/ehcsdj0x/17/
[11:33:58] <taplar> your not listening man
[11:34:10] <taplar> $('.team-tabs .team-tabs-nav li') <-- this is not scoped
[11:34:35] <taplar> it will find all lis that have a parent that is team-tabs-nav that has a parent of team-tabs
[11:34:49] <taplar> you only want the one relative to the li you are handling an event for
[11:35:06] <taplar> if you look at the api for closest, you will see that it can be used to find a parent for a given element
[11:35:20] <Guest95782> ('.team-tabs-nav li').closest('.team-tabs'); ?
[11:35:43] <taplar> how is that relative to the li that is being handled?
[11:35:46] <Guest95782> or should I use .parents()?
[11:35:50] <taplar> what element is being handeled?
[11:36:00] <Guest95782> .team-tabs-nav li
[11:36:03] <taplar> no
[11:36:08] <taplar> well yes
[11:36:12] <taplar> but which one, specifically?
[11:36:23] <Guest95782> the one being clicked
[11:36:29] <taplar> which is?
[11:36:33] <Guest95782> $(this).parents()?
[11:36:43] <taplar> 'this' dude
[11:37:02] <taplar> 'this' is the li that was clicked
[11:37:08] <Guest95782> yeah
[11:37:21] <taplar> so, if I wanted to find the team-tabs that the li belongs to I could...
[11:37:52] <Guest95782> using closest?
[11:37:55] <taplar> yes
[11:38:16] <Guest95782> $(this).closest('.team-tabs'); ?
[11:38:20] <taplar> boom
[11:38:43] <taplar> store that in a var and use that var to find the other stuff
[11:41:21] <Guest95782> how would I handle the remove on that li? do I just use: 		$(clicked_li).removeClass('current');   or do i need to specify to remove from the li?
[11:41:27] <Guest95782> https://jsfiddle.net/ehcsdj0x/21/
[11:42:12] <taplar> first off, 'clicked_li' is not the clicked li.  it's the team-tabs, so you should rename that.
[11:42:58] <taplar> and then it's just finding off of it.  so if you renamed it to $teamTab then you would do $teamTab.find('whateverChildSelector')
[11:45:30] <Guest95782> WOW, i'm a noob and never even used find :o
[11:45:39] <Guest95782> https://jsfiddle.net/ehcsdj0x/24/
[11:46:06] <taplar> bread and butter dude, :)  drill that into your head.  you're gonna use it a lot
[11:46:19] <Guest95782> That's literally magical to me haha
[11:46:25] <Guest95782> thanks so much man, have a good one!
[11:46:30] <taplar> you too
[11:48:09] <Elles> hello, I havea function, and I want to use its parameter while creating json string say, function(val) { var json = { val : "abc" } }
[11:48:29] <Elles> but it doesnt replace val with the parameter passed, only leaves text val
[11:48:41] <taplar> i think you can surround it with () and it will evaluate it
[11:50:11] <Elles> nope
[11:51:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/p7b6Lxm2/  apparently it's brackets
[11:51:43] <taplar> i knew someone enlightened me to that a few months ago
[11:52:10] <Elles> win
[11:52:13] <Elles> thank you
[12:00:01] <VectorX> in this exmple http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oZBrpa if you drag the scrollbar down, when the top section is removed the scrollbar jumps and its at the bottom of the content, the desired effect us similar to when you scroll with the mousewheel where the page seamlessly transitions down, how could the scrollbar jerk be fixed when dragging it ?
[12:01:21] <taplar> probably more of a css question
[12:01:58] <VectorX> taplar i was asking in there, but thought it might be jquery related since im removing the element with JS and perhaps something need to be set at that point
[12:02:27] <taplar> though my initial though is that the header could be positioned absolute with the rest of the body having a margin-top to push it past the header.  then removing the header would not affect the page height.
[12:02:37] <taplar> but you'd be left with the white space at the top
[12:03:33] <sonu_nk> hi  , i want suggestion from you expert. i am working with a form builder.. and i added custom script that will add the styling for form, fields and background etc.. but for this my script adding inline css when i am changing border, color, font and etc.. my idea to add classes for this..
[12:03:39] <VectorX> yeah, same problem again then when the margin is removed
[12:03:48] <taplar> VectorX: yeah
[12:04:09] <sonu_nk> but not getting how can i modify class and where to store... how to store..
[12:07:02] <taplar> sonu_nk: by a form builder you mean some sort of script that is generating the form for you?
[12:07:15] <sonu_nk> yes taplar
[12:07:48] <taplar> ok, well if you want to use classes instead of inline scripts, you can addClass() and removeClass() to elements
[12:10:43] <sonu_nk> taplar:
[12:10:54] <sonu_nk> sorry can you send me your msgs again
[12:10:59] <taplar> ok, well if you want to use classes instead of inline scripts, you can addClass() and removeClass() to elements
[12:11:02] <sonu_nk> i was offf
[12:12:19] <taplar> brb, i'm going to go get me some food
[12:12:41] <sonu_nk> that ok..i know how to do this.. but the question is this time i am adding inline css.. but i have lot of users and each user will do its own styling .. and thats not possible to create static stylessheet..
[12:21:59] <fission6> is this not the right way to include multipel selectors $('.product-name', '.menu-thumbnail').on('click',
[12:22:21] <fission6> i see
[12:26:52] <taplar> fission6: single string
[12:29:18] <sonu_nk> taplar:
[12:29:23] <sonu_nk> that ok..i know how to do this.. but the question is this time i am adding inline css.. but i have lot of users and each user will do its own styling .. and thats not possible to create static stylessheet..
[12:29:41] <taplar> right
[12:31:19] <sonu_nk> wht will be : i should create css sheet for each user.. then user when user will styling using option then in that stylesheet the classes with style should add...
[12:31:24] <taplar> however you could potentially setup how you are going to put classes on the things, and let the users style with those classes
[12:32:02] <sonu_nk> but wht user edit the style. then how i willl edit the stylesheet ?
[12:32:06] <sonu_nk> confussed
[12:32:25] <taplar> so you can put any class on something, right?
[12:32:47] <taplar> class="blah"  blah doesn't have to exist in a stylesheet
[12:32:53] <sonu_nk> yes..
[12:33:21] <taplar> so then if you have that, if you add the dynamic css rules some where on the page that contain rules for .blah, it will affect that element
[12:34:39] <sonu_nk> yes,,, taplar
[12:35:52] <sonu_nk> wht i am suggesting me. is that i will create a css for each form of user.. and when user changes its css using options then the css class will be written on stylesheet dynamically ...
[12:36:48] <taplar> ok?
[12:37:31] <sonu_nk> i send you msg pvt
[12:37:36] <sonu_nk> something shared there
[12:38:15] <taplar> i closed the tab before going to the link.  please try to keep the discussions in the room.  others can potentially help and also learn from the discussion too
[12:38:37] <taplar> at this point i'm not quite sure what your question is.
[12:39:01] <sonu_nk> taplar: ok..
[12:39:10] <sonu_nk> i am sharing my screenshot here. https://s3.amazonaws.com/awesomescreenshot/upload//525664/9c4f07af-f072-4dc8-5758-60fc8b6fddd1.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJSCJQ2NM3XLFPVKA&Expires=1489082917&Signature=dBmXn3MTu6YypZPHvCU2q3%2B%2Bc3Q%3D
[12:39:43] <sonu_nk> in this screenshot you can see the form styling option which have option to change style..
[12:39:58] <taplar> sure
[12:40:48] <taplar> i'm assuming you are using the right hand side as a preview before they save, and it changes as they change options?
[12:41:18] <sonu_nk> now when i am changing style from these option then i am adding inline style for this
[12:41:32] <sonu_nk> taplar: yes
[12:41:53] <taplar> so what's the question?
[12:42:37] <sonu_nk> now i dont wnt to put style in inline
[12:42:50] <taplar> for the preview?
[12:42:57] <sonu_nk> yes..
[12:43:16] <taplar> why not?
[12:43:24] <taplar> it makes sense in this use case
[12:43:58] <taplar> the finished product should probably not have inline styles, but preview inline makes sense
[12:43:59] <sonu_nk> and when i will put it on website then it should have stylesheet as inline is not a best pratice..
[12:44:12] <taplar> they don't have to be the same
[12:44:23] <taplar> it's completely different use cases
[12:47:20] <sonu_nk> taplar: wht u suggest now
[12:47:58] <taplar> use inline for the preview.  when it comes time to generate the results, create the stylesheet from the users choices that they will use on the finished product
[12:52:48] <sonu_nk> taplar: thats great. means at last final step i should generate a stylesheet for user ..
[12:52:58] <taplar> yep
[12:53:29] <taplar> r/should/can ;)
[12:54:23] <sonu_nk> and that i need to keep track from which element tag i need to get inline style .. right
[12:54:26] <sonu_nk> taplar:
[12:54:48] <taplar> no you wouldn't get the inline styles
[12:54:55] <taplar> you have the options that you generated the inline styles from
[12:54:59] <taplar> use those
[12:55:17] <sonu_nk> better i will use session variables. :P
[12:55:37] <taplar> *shrug* sounds like you have some ideas, :)
[12:56:04] <sonu_nk> web storage or session variable best option or not ?
[12:56:21] <sonu_nk> or there is something option othere
[12:56:33] <taplar> depends on what your business says really
[12:57:25] <sonu_nk> taplar: session varible will be secure becuase no one can change it from DOM
[12:57:30] <sonu_nk> right ?
[12:57:47] <taplar> by session variable you mean a variable on your server?
[12:59:50] <sonu_nk> no browser session storage
[13:00:18] <taplar> any javascript variable is open to be tampered with really
[13:00:33] <taplar> you can make it more difficult, but anyone can get to them if they want to
[13:00:46] <taplar> localStorage, sessionStorage are easily accessable
[13:01:43] <sonu_nk> taplar: anyway if user changes it then its thier responsiblty
[13:01:50] <taplar> yep
[13:02:02] <sonu_nk> thankyou
[13:02:18] <sonu_nk> you discussed with me and i got a best solution till now..
[13:02:29] <sonu_nk> i will think more on this
[13:02:34] <taplar> good deal
[13:03:19] <taplar> always think more on advice you get from some random guy in a chat room, ;)
[13:04:55] <sonu_nk> taplar: yes
[13:35:25] <Duikb00t-home> o/

[15:13:42] <pippuccio76> Hi at all
[15:14:33] <pippuccio76> i have a datatable , how can i order by european date : https://jsfiddle.net/ty3y9eof/
[15:22:30] <SpecialTech> is there a way to grab an attribute value of an attribute value? lol... https://jsfiddle.net/td4s3m65/1/ I need to grab 'data-category-zoom'
[15:30:26] <MikeD_> that's not an attribute - it's just a string
[15:30:51] <MikeD_> you either need to create that dom fragment, then get an attribute value from it - or parse the string
[15:31:30] <MikeD_> or don't encode html into the attribute of another html element
[15:33:16] <SpecialTech> Miked_ thanks

[17:14:35] <Elles> Im using on.('change') event handler for the input field with select (autocomplete) when I click the option the event triggers for the letter Ive input + 2nd time when the option from the dropdown is picked
[17:14:41] <Elles> how to prevent the 1st trigger
[17:14:54] <Elles> maybe 'change' event is the wrong pick
[18:00:36] <javirscreept> I have a div and am using .resizeable(). I love it. However the table in the DIV I'm resizing winds up expanding out the bottom of the DIV if I resize it too small. Any ideas? I'm starting to wonder if I can use a call back function to undo the lasst resize if it causes this.

[19:34:21] <arymaynart> hi. Sorry to ask, but i really need a hand. Can some one help me?
[19:35:02] <arymaynart> I am trying to apply a jQuery code on my wordpress website and not having the spected result.
[19:35:30] <arymaynart> it is related to a sub menu delay
[19:40:37] <arymaynart> hello!??
[19:44:30] <arymaynart> i am trying to use fadeOut() on my menu with this code and it is not working: jQuery(function($) { $('#Top_bar .menu li').hover(function(){     $('.sub-menu', this).show(); }, function(){     $('.sub-menu', this).delay(2000).fadeOut(); }); });
[19:44:46] <arymaynart> Can some one tell me what i am doing wrong?
[20:08:59] <arymaynart> I have this website: www.refrigeracaomota.com.br There is a menu and the menu-item "Comprar". When user point mouse to the item "Comprar", a submenu apears bellow it. My problem is: When the user tries to select an option of this submenu and pass the mouse over another option on the way, the submenu desapear right away. I need to put a litle delay before it start to desapear. I found this function: jQuery(function($) {  $('#Top_
[22:32:01] <Yepp> how do I require at least one group of array input with jqueryvalidation? they are named like name="sample[][property1]", name="sample[][property2]"
[22:32:53] <Yepp> or at least, how do I do something like: $('input[name="sample[*][*]"]') ?
[22:36:58] <pavonia> Yepp: Are there other inputs that match on just "sample*"?
[22:38:41] <Yepp> pavonia: I'm trying to follow this https://jqueryvalidation.org/require_from_group-method/ the problem with that is
[22:39:34] <Yepp> if atleast sample[0][property1], sample[0][property2], or any other property has value they are already valid
[22:40:14] <Yepp> what I need is at least a group of "sample" is complete. e.g: sample[0][property1] + sample[0][property2] has value
[22:40:45] <pavonia> So you can do a prefix match: $('input[name^="sample[0]"]')
[22:41:44] <Yepp> let me try. first time trying to play with those kind of selectors actually so a bit confusing. brb
[22:52:25] <Yepp> pavonia: https://www.hastebin.com/mesemasedi.scala
[22:52:31] <Yepp> a bit more clear
[22:52:44] <Yepp> didn't work
[22:55:58] <pavonia> Yepp: Does the selector work without validate?
[22:58:26] <Yepp> pavonia: not sure if I should select all but yea. All inputs with sample[][...anything here...] are returned
[22:58:57] <_August_> can someone take a quick look at my code? I am trying to remove the read only when the checkbox is clicked. It works when I have the checkbox and textfield rendered on the page but when I try it with dynamic created items it doesnt work... https://jsfiddle.net/8rqy6ynm/
[23:00:10] <pavonia> Yepp: I don't know then, sorry
[23:02:28] <Yepp> thanks for the tip about the selector i'll try to fiddle more. even I is a little confuse too
[23:09:37] <_August_> no suggestions?
[23:10:34] <Yepp> _August_ when you created a new checkbox there is no handler set to them
[23:10:58] <Yepp> instead
[23:11:37] <Yepp> try doing $('.billing_codes').on('change', 'input[type="checkbox"]', function(event) ......)
[23:12:08] <Yepp> when the page was rendered and the handlers were set, they were only binded to what are on the page
[23:13:06] <_August_> hmm dont think i can do that
[23:13:30] <Yepp> trying doing alert($('input[type="checkbox"]) you will see when the page got loaded jQuery would not find the checkboxes because it doesn't exist yet
[23:13:51] <Yepp> put .on() on their parent/container
[23:14:05] <Yepp> in your example, in billing_codes
[23:15:41] <_August_> well if i put the billing codes class as the selector its not going to work across the other checkboxes I have across the site
[23:16:08] <_August_> billing codes is more so a wrapper for this specific section
[23:16:25] <Yepp> _August_ https://jsfiddle.net/8rqy6ynm/1/
[23:16:35] <Yepp> try making something like that then
[23:16:43] <_August_> thats why im using [type='checkbox'][class^='di_'] that why it will look for any checkbox with the class di_
[23:16:54] <Yepp> you could even do it in body but I don't think that's a good idea
[23:18:22] <_August_> hmm well it would work
[23:18:42] <_August_> and if i throw the class sector on it that would narrow down what its selecting
[23:19:24] <_August_> i think ill do that
[23:19:25] <_August_> thanks
