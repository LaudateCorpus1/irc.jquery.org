[00:02:01] <LukeNukem> Cork, timer is an attribute?
[00:02:26] <Cork> LukeNukem: its just a variable
[00:02:29] <LukeNukem> ok
[00:02:41] <LukeNukem> i should put that above the ajax request right
[00:02:58] <beasty> morning
[00:03:05] <LukeNukem> mornin
[00:04:48] <LukeNukem> Cork, $(this).data('timer') = setTimeout (this.doStuff, 2000);
[00:04:48] <LukeNukem> ?
[00:10:01] <doktorj> Cork: $("irc://irc.freenode.net/#material_thumb_1").data('large_image') is what i have basically (only the 1 is getting generated dynamically (which i double checked is working and matches with the dom elements on the page, which all have large_image attachments via data()
[00:10:13] <doktorj> but when i try to select them, i keep getting undefined
[00:12:13] <doktorj> Cork: it pasted wrong, basically I have what you suggested: Cork: doktorj: $("#material_thumb_1").data('large_image')
[00:12:56] <LukeNukem> Cork, see the first answer here
[00:12:57] <LukeNukem> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9715292/creating-a-timer-to-check-if-user-is-typing
[00:17:27] <mindis|wurk> sigh. RTEs are really frustrating
[00:17:40] <Cork> doktorj: check what your generated js look like
[00:19:10] <doktorj> Cork: i got it figured out, thanx to a hint by you - thanx alot
[00:21:17] <mindis|wurk> Cork so i tried something like appending a new <p> if the caret is currently in the contenteditable div itself. then i gave that p contenteditable and moved focus to it and then remove contenteditable from it but it still just writes into the div directly :(
[00:21:58] <mindis|wurk> or rather in firefox it creates that ugly span and in chrome a new div but that's just standard behavior for them
[00:22:14] <Cork> mindis|wurk: this is what you want http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area
[00:22:34] <mindis|wurk> i think it only works in text areas?
[00:22:44] <Cork> no
[00:22:51] <mindis|wurk> plus i have no idea how to get the right position
[00:22:54] <Cork> it works in any element you have a caret
[00:23:38] <Cork> you do it by doing it on the div you added
[00:24:58] <mindis|wurk> uhhhm. sorry, did you mean <p> i added?
[00:25:07] <Cork> yes
[00:25:31] <Cork> grab a dom reference to it and set caret position
[00:30:50] <mindis|wurk> doesn't seem to work. i wonder if i need to stop the default event
[00:31:26] <Cork> the default event is? focus? click?
[00:31:42] <mindis|wurk> keydown
[00:32:02] <Cork> hmm thats prob going to be a bit tricky
[00:32:42] <mindis|wurk> the only thing i really want is to stop the user from writing into the div directly since it's a complete mess after that
[00:32:55] <Cork> i think the only way to solve that, it so let the event happen and then move the typed text :s
[00:33:00] <mindis|wurk> though of course the user shouldn't be able to notice his control is being manipulated
[00:33:42] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you could automatically add the p when the cursor is moved and by that add it before they type anything
[00:34:04] <Cork> (cursor movment needs to be tracked through key* though)
[00:34:33] <Cork> then i think you would have to try to move the cursor though setTimeout, to let the key event end
[00:34:39] <Cork> it prob overwrites your changes
[00:34:54] <mindis|wurk> hmmm. i tried preventing the default event and it seems like the function from stackoverflow isn't moving the caret inside the new p
[00:34:56] <Cork> setTimeout(function() {},0) solves that nicly
[00:36:09] <Cork> mindis|wurk: where you move it isn't a problem, its when you do it
[00:36:36] <mindis|wurk> i think it is since it's not happening at all
[00:36:55] <Cork> cause the browser overwrites your change yes
[00:39:48] <mindis|wurk> i was assuming this would be as simple as detecting in what type of element the caret is in and if it's wrong, find a p to move it into
[00:40:12] <mindis|wurk> but it's almost like everything in js is against creating RTEs
[00:40:17] <Cork> cater positioning is a lot harder then that
[00:40:43] <Cork> browsers try to primarly focus on the users wishes
[00:41:04] <Cork> (and i think thats a good thing)
[00:43:25] <mindis|wurk> originally i was trying to just change the input so that if the typing was done in the div it would turn it into <p>whateverkey</p> but that didn't work either since the caret wouldn't stay inside that p
[00:44:35] <Cork> mindis|wurk: might be worth diggin in things like ckeditor and see how they solve it
[00:45:04] <Cork> (i know they do solve it)
[00:45:23] <mindis|wurk> i guess it might be the only option. i'd use aloha editor instead of my own but their license doesn't permit commercial use for free
[00:45:34] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!!!!! :-))))))))))
[00:47:22] <Cork> mindis|wurk: i meant looking in the code or ask in there channel
[00:47:44] <mindis|wurk> yeah, i got the idea
[00:48:02] <mindis|wurk> doubt they have a channel though
[00:48:05] <Lurzino> I have something like var expandYes = "<label id='label-btn-yes' class='ui-button ui-button-icon-only ui-widget ui-state-default ui-btn-expand-yes'><span id='span-btn-yes' class='ui-button-icon-primary ui-icon ui-icon-plusthick' onClick='expandYes(\""+child_table_id+"\","+id_row+");'></span><span class='ui-button-text'>Button</span></label>"; and in the function expandYes() I'd like to get the current button element so I tried to use $(this) but it didn't work
[00:48:22] <Cork> mindis|wurk: i think they at least had one
[00:48:34] <hExDj> I have an a tag and would like to add a span tag around it
[00:48:37] <hExDj> is it possible?
[00:49:00] <Cork> Lurzino: uh.. function?
[00:49:06] <Cork> it is a string or a function?
[00:49:16] <Lurzino> Cork yes... it's an onClick function
[00:49:29] <Lurzino> as you can see inside the <span> tag
[00:49:33] <Cork> uh no onclick in an inline event
[00:50:04] <Lurzino> well Cork I needed it because I put the button inside a jqGrid cell
[00:50:14] <Cork> do you mean expandYes is a global function and a local variable to a function that creates the elements?
[00:50:15] <Lurzino> as you can see in this code line: jQuery("#"+child_table_id).jqGrid('setCell', 1, 'Action_Yes', expandYes);
[00:50:37] <Lurzino> exact Corey
[00:50:39] <Lurzino> ops Cork
[00:50:46] <Cork> ugg
[00:50:48] <Cork> ok
[00:50:58] <kaputtmacher> can someone help me out understanding some query DOM stuff? i log an jQuery wrapped object to my console, how can i access the properties of this object ?
[00:51:23] <Cork> Lurzino: when your using inline events like that you need to pass the this variable to your function
[00:51:45] <Cork> kaputtmacher: depends on the console
[00:52:01] <Cork> firebug is the only one that let you explore objects as far as i know
[00:52:14] <kaputtmacher> i'm using firebug
[00:52:31] <Cork> then just click the output
[00:52:37] <Lurzino> Cork, you mean I should do something like: <span id='span-btn-yes' class='ui-button-icon-primary ui-icon ui-icon-plusthick' onClick='expandYes(\""+child_table_id+"\","+id_row+","+$(this)+");'> ?
[00:52:39] <Cork> and you should be taken to the object view
[00:52:45] <Cork> no
[00:52:54] <kaputtmacher> well, this works quite well, but how can i access a certain property via js then?
[00:53:06] <Cork> Lurzino: expandYes(\""+child_table_id+"\","+id_row+",this)
[00:53:14] <Lurzino> ah!
[00:53:23] <kaputtmacher> if $element is my object and if i click on the console to discover it, it lists href "some/url"
[00:53:24] <Cork> Linex__: onclick is a call it has a local scope
[00:53:28] <kaputtmacher> how can i access that href ?
[00:53:52] <Lurzino> Cork, I put "this" even the whole line is in a variable?
[00:54:01] <Cork> $element.attr('href')
[00:54:05] <kaputtmacher> aaah okay
[00:54:10] <kaputtmacher> thx
[00:54:22] <Cork> Lurzino: do you know what the "this" variable is?
[00:54:40] <Lurzino> yes... it's a pointer to current element where I am clicking on
[00:54:47] <Cork> exactly
[00:55:02] <Cork> the click events sets this variable
[00:55:08] <Cork> so it exists in the onclick handler
[00:55:19] <Lurzino> ok Cork thanks :-)
[00:55:24] <Cork> you calling a function from there (the code you put there is live parsed)
[00:55:54] <Cork> so you need to have the text this in the params so you can parse it in the handler and forward it
[00:56:26] <Lurzino> ah ok thanks Cork, just I was convicted I had to do like "+$(this)+"
[00:56:31] <Lurzino> but I was wrong
[00:56:35] <Lurzino> as you explained
[00:56:55] <Lurzino> so I thank you.. later I'll try it out now breakfast time hehe ;)
[00:57:14] <Lurzino> thanks again Cork!
[00:57:14] <Cork> Lurzino: personally i would prefer to reference it instead of using inline event handlers
[00:57:23] <Lurzino> reference it like ?
[00:57:35] <Cork> you could give it a class for example
[00:58:15] <Cork> then you could do something like jQuery("#"+child_table_id).on('click', '.my-class', function() {});
[00:58:29] <Lurzino> hmmm would be a good idea too
[00:58:31] <Cork> much cleaner
[00:58:33] <Lurzino> I'll try that out too
[00:59:17] <Lurzino> copied your line sample code and I'll take a look later :)
[00:59:21] <Lurzino> thanks again Cork :)
[00:59:23] <Lurzino> gotta go now
[00:59:26] <Lurzino> ciao! :)
[01:00:09] <D4> Any suggestions on what to use for mobile redirection? I was thinking I'd do a media query to @import another CSS file, but then I decided I wanted to strip content etc, so a new file.html is needed for devices - what do you use to redirect devices?
[01:01:43] <kaputtmacher> htaccess
[01:01:53] <kaputtmacher> or php recognizing useragents

[01:06:33] <kaputtmacher> Cork,I'm stuck with my problem. I'm trying to fix some fancy box functionality
[01:06:54] <kaputtmacher> fancy box doesn't resize properly if iframe content is loaded
[01:07:11] <Cork> kaputtmacher: code please
[01:07:21] <Cork> ?p

[01:08:51] <mindis|wurk> ugh. ckeditors code is so complex i can't make anything out of it
[01:09:39] <Cork> mindis|wurk: ya its going to be a bit of digging
[01:10:14] <Cork> mindis|wurk: you could try searching for 13 or enter
[01:13:02] <mindis|wurk> Cork mmm actually the browsers own handling for enter works okay-ish, the problems only occur when the caret winds up in the parent div. that only happens when stuff is deleted
[01:14:00] <Cork> mindis|wurk: ya i know, but i think they do something there
[01:14:18] <Cork> hmm maybe even s/think/guess/
[01:14:21] <mindis|wurk> i'm not sure if it would be feasible to switch the span and div firefox and chrome create to p
[01:14:49] <mindis|wurk> after they're created that is
[01:15:03] <Cork> thats what ckeditor does
[01:15:17] <Cork> oh wait
[01:15:21] <Cork> no its the other way around
[01:15:22] <mindis|wurk> that probably messes up the caret though
[01:15:42] <Cork> hmm... man my memory is failing me...
[01:16:01] <mindis|wurk> i'm surprise your brain works at all after all your js experience
[01:16:04] <Cork> mindis|wurk: in ckeditor enter or ctrl+enter creates a p, and the other creates a <br>
[01:16:05] <mindis|wurk> *surprised
[01:16:15] <Cork> lol
[01:18:36] <Cork> mindis|wurk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220939/force-ie-contenteditable-element-to-create-line-breaks-on-enter-key-without-bre
[01:19:44] <john2x> hi. a.attr('href'); returns "#some_id", but a.prop('href); returns "http://domain.com/#some_id". Is that intentional? How do I get "#some_id" only using .prop()?
[01:20:17] <mindis|wurk> Cork sorry, i don't quite get how that affects what i do. i want to specifically keep everything in <p>s
[01:20:20] <Cork> john2x: yes its intentional
[01:20:52] <Cork> mindis|wurk: the element you put things in inside the contenteditable defines what it creates on enter
[01:21:01] <Cork> (haven't tried this my self)
[01:21:13] <john2x> Cork, is there a way to make .prop() return only "#some_id"? I'd like to avoid using deprecated code.
[01:21:27] <Cork> john2x: attr isn't depricated
[01:21:30] <Cork> not in a long shot
[01:21:34] <mindis|wurk> yes, i know chrome behaves differently if there's a <p> in the div and such but such behavior only applies when there's something already there
[01:21:43] <Cork> prop features was moved out of attr into its own function
[01:22:06] <Cork> john2x: attr reads the actial attribute on the dom element
[01:22:12] <mindis|wurk> also firefox only makes limited use of that. if the caret wounds up in the parent div it reverts to its ugly default behaviour
[01:22:17] <Cork> john2x: while prop uses the properties on the dom element
[01:22:28] <Cork> attr == getAttribute
[01:22:35] <Cork> or rather
[01:22:49] <Cork> $(this).attr('href') == this.getAttribute('href')
[01:23:05] <Cork> while $(this).prop('href') == this.href
[01:23:36] <john2x> ah so I should stick with .attr() for this instance? (when getting the actual value of an attribute)
[01:23:48] <Cork> if you want attribute value use attr
[01:23:52] <Cork> if you want property use prop
[01:24:17] <Cork> and property for href is the full url
[01:24:23] <john2x> ah got it. thanks! I assumed from the docs that attr is deprecated with prop.
[01:24:32] <Cork> nope
[01:25:12] <Cork> john2x: actually most of the time ppl want attr, and thats what made it a bit messy where attr was both
[01:25:58] <beasty> is there a way to show html in a alert ?
[01:26:04] <john2x> ahh.. thanks for the clarification, I'll keep that in mind.
[01:26:19] <Cork> beasty: html sure, just give it the html
[01:26:26] <Cork> beasty: if you mean dom thats another matter :)
[01:26:39] <Cork> then you need to serialize it to html before you alert it
[01:27:21] <kaputtmacher> Cork: puh http://jsfiddle.net/AShHY/
[01:27:50] <kaputtmacher> seems not to work that properly but my problem still exists
[01:28:07] <Cork> kaputtmacher: its an iframe?
[01:28:12] <kaputtmacher> there are some scrollbars around the form
[01:28:13] <kaputtmacher> yes
[01:28:19] * Cork nods
[01:28:24] <beasty> Cork: it contains <p> but for some reason the <p> is shown in the alert
[01:28:57] <Cork> is or isn't?
[01:29:03] <kaputtmacher> it is an iframe
[01:29:15] <Cork> kaputtmacher: ya i got that
[01:29:26] <Cork> (the question was for beasty
[01:29:27] <Cork> ()
[01:29:38] <kaputtmacher> ah okay
[01:29:52] <Cork> kaputtmacher: where was it you had problem again?
[01:30:01] <mindis|wurk> Cork this is nice and perverse. i tried replacing all <span> with <p> on keyup, works as you'd expect in that it replaces them and the caret goes to the wrong place. however, when you keep typing in FF it ends up writing pure textnodes without spans after that in the parent div
[01:30:25] <kaputtmacher> well i'm trying to use some fancy box callbacks to adjust the height which should be fetch from the iframe's content
[01:30:54] <kaputtmacher> right before fancy box starts animation
[01:31:09] <kaputtmacher> which would be afterLoad
[01:32:57] <Cork> kaputtmacher: the overlay goes bonkers for some reason
[01:33:10] <Cork> .fancybox-overlay
[01:33:15] <Cork> sorry #fancybox-overlay
[01:33:32] <kaputtmacher> i will add some fancy.css
[01:33:35] <kaputtmacher> mom
[01:34:09] <Cork> kaputtmacher: i meant thats why you get the scrollbars
[01:34:58] <Cork> looks like fancybox assumes something thats not true after your modifications
[01:35:04] <beasty> Cork: no it just show the unparsed html
[01:35:19] <beasty> sorry for the late reply but i need to do a release around 10'ish
[01:35:37] <kaputtmacher> you can delete my modifications the behavior remains the same
[01:35:55] <kaputtmacher> just remove the callbacks afterLoad & beforeShow completly
[01:37:08] <Cork> well the problem is the overlay
[01:37:26] <kaputtmacher> hmm i will disable it
[01:37:45] <Cork> if you set position: absolute; top:0;left:0 to it it works fine here
[01:38:46] <LukeNukem> How can i change the value of a data attribute?
[01:39:33] <kaputtmacher> Cork, i was talking about the scrollbars of the fancy box content
[01:39:42] <kaputtmacher> .fancybox-inner
[01:40:06] <kaputtmacher> fancy box fetches the height of the content to load
[01:40:17] <Cork> ah
[01:40:33] <kaputtmacher> the fetched content is 150, but if check it with firebug it should be 660 or something
[01:40:38] <Cork> you mean the scrollbar on the fancybox-inner?
[01:40:40] <LukeNukem> Cork, hey dude i need some help about that thing i was doing earlier
[01:40:43] <kaputtmacher> yes
[01:41:16] <Cork> well fancy box builds it relative to the browser window
[01:41:16] <kaputtmacher> i don't get it where fancy box has the 150 px from
[01:41:23] <LukeNukem> i got the timer to work but then again the ajax call keeps happening and the title of the web page is alerted 2 times
[01:54:07] <mindis|wurk> bah. there's a setSelectionRange in firefox and chrome but it only works for textareas in firefox
[01:55:47] <kaputtmacher> Cork, is it possible that the height is fetched way too fast and thus results in being about 135 - 150 px ?
[01:56:08] <Cork> yes you can have a race condition
[01:56:16] <Cork> especially as your doing it with an iframe
[01:56:21] <Cork> they'r async
[02:00:38] <kaputtmacher> how can i analyze if this causes my problem ?
[02:01:45] <Cork> breakpoints is normally the best solution

[02:54:40] <Blaster> getting random error "c is undefined" when doing a $.each(array,function(i,val) { .. }); function, any ideas?
[03:03:35] <antgel_> hey
[03:04:06] <Blaster> Hey say my jquery file is simply $(function() { var myVar = 123});   How come I can't go to the console and type myVar and see 123 returned?
[03:05:04] <antgel_> i'd like to ask about using jquery to create content.  i have a project that's a lightweight demo - html / css / js - no backend.  have some html code that repeats it's structure a lot.  was thinking of generating it on the fly with jquery upon page load.  is this a valid / useful technique in my use case or is it likely to be slow?
[03:06:00] <antgel_> Blaster: i'm guessing as a jquery newbie, but could it be because the variable is out of scope by the time you type in the console?
[03:09:18] <cyphr> Hey, getting "Component returned failure code: 0x80460001 (NS_ERROR_CANNOT_CONVERT_DATA) [nsIDOMFormData.append]" when I try to click the file upload image with Firefox, what's wrong?
[03:09:23] <cyphr> Using drupal7 and jquery.form
[03:09:24] <cyphr> .js
[03:09:40] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've corrected my html as suggested but am still getting the uncaught error about outerWidth
[03:10:24] <Cork> cyphr: can't be told just from the error message
[03:10:45] <cyphr> Cork: An error occurred while attempting to process /clients/XXXX/file/ajax/field_submissions_image/und/0/form-2xIpnDkJmI4rWroBr88PQkGgka6jOVz7jCeYmTi21_A: Component returned failure code: 0x80460001 (NS_ERROR_CANNOT_CONVERT_DATA) [nsIDOMFormData.append]
[03:10:46] <Cork> cyphr: but something tries to add something to a dom element that can't be added
[03:10:58] <cyphr> This works in webkit BUT NOT in Firefox
[03:11:09] <Cork> cyphr: its not posible to say from just that
[03:11:29] <Cork> unless stepping through the js code could that be said
[03:11:57] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: code?
[03:12:38] <tPl0ch> Hi, is there a native jquery method to get the max() value from an array?
[03:13:26] <tPl0ch> i.e. max([1, 4, 89]) = 89
[03:13:36] <Cork> tPl0ch: no need theres one in js
[03:13:47] <Cork> ?mdc max
[03:13:48] <bot-t> Cork, Math.max - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns the largest of zero or more numbers. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max
[03:14:10] <tPl0ch> Cork, moep, thanks...
[03:14:12] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: http://pastie.org/3599847
[03:14:17] * tPl0ch feels dumbzoned
[03:14:30] <mytoz> Math.max.apply([], [1, 4, 89])
[03:14:50] <Cork> ah, right
[03:15:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what was the link to your live page?
[03:15:08] <mytoz> or: var a = [1,4,89], max = Math.max.apply([], a);
[03:15:27] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: It's the part underneath the big slider http://www.advantagedigitalmedia.co.uk/
[03:16:10] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: this isn't a problem but your ending your link with </script> ;)
[03:16:17] <Cork> just remove it link is like br
[03:16:27] <Cork> (<link/> is fine)
[03:19:52] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: outerWidth was defined in 1.2.6 your jquery is too old
[03:20:16] <Cork> *to old
[03:20:26] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, really? that simple!
[03:21:08] <fRAiLtY-> What's the link to the constantly up-to-date jquery file on the net?
[03:21:12] <fayimora> can i mix twitter bootstrap and query ui??
[03:21:19] <fayimora> jqueryui
[03:21:24] <Cork> ?g google code ajax api
[03:21:26] <bot-t> Cork, Google Libraries API - Google Code - http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/
[03:21:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ^
[03:22:33] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but be warnd 1.5+ is A LOT different from 1.2 or even 1.3
[03:22:43] <Cork> so lots of things might break in your code
[03:22:46] <fRAiLtY-> Ok
[03:22:50] <fgro> jquery noob. i have a function local that is defined withing a function global. How can I access/test the local function from firebug console?
[03:23:22] <Cork> fgro: exporting it to the globa scope
[03:23:31] <fRAiLtY-> Ok Cork will bare that in mind
[03:23:33] <Cork> or breakpointing inside the scope
[03:23:39] <fgro> Cork: how do i export?
[03:23:43] <fayimora> can i mix twitter bootstrap and jqueryui??
[03:23:59] <Cork> window.my_temporarly_exported_function = local_function;
[03:24:07] <Cork> fgro: ^
[03:25:11] <fgro> Cork: ;-)
[03:31:26] <majd> Hey #jquery
[03:31:49] <majd> i have this function that is called by the datepicker ui element for the beforeShowDate function: http://jsfiddle.net/majdal/AFTLT/
[03:32:13] <majd> is it correct? it doesn't seem to be working...
[03:37:33] <rabbi1> I am searching for  visualize.jquery.js  can anyone help me with documentation link and .js link ?
[03:39:44] <phil-adept> rabbi1: Google is your friend. Searching for "visualize.jquery.js" and look at hte 1st result.
[03:39:52] <phil-adept> rabbi1: ?HEre's the link you require
[03:39:55] <phil-adept> https://github.com/filamentgroup/jQuery-Visualize
[03:44:26] <rabbi1> phil-adept: thanks a lot, i got that result, but confused a bit reading "filament group"
[03:45:36] <phil-adept> rabbi1: no worries. I've never used visualize before, but I have used highcharts (http://www.highcharts.com/) and they seem to be quite good as well
[03:46:11] <vpv4oo> im trying to embed an OpenLayers map element (based on OpenStreetMap) (like Google Maps API) on a website. when i embed it regularily it loads the map, whenever i try to embed it inside of a page that is loaded into a div (with the same regular head) via jquery it doesnt load
[03:46:26] <rabbi1> phil-adept: yeah, i infact got that. its superb, but not free :(
[03:47:42] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: via an iFrame? Do you have jquery loaded on the page displayed in the iFrame?
[03:48:22] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: its not an iFrame, its just a div id="map" and javascript code loading the map and interface
[03:49:21] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: Sorry, I was confused as you said "inside of a page that is loaded into a div (with the same regular head)". Do you have example code to show?
[03:49:21] <vpv4oo> code very similar to the map loading examples here http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenLayers_Simple_Example
[03:49:54] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: For debugging it's ideal to use the code you're debugging not an example that's very similar :)
[03:50:05] <kanzie> Im trying to set up a build-environment for my single web-page app
[03:50:09] <kanzie> has anyone worked a lot with the build-script for h5bp
[03:50:25] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: If you can send us some of the code you're actually testing I could look at it for you
[03:51:08] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: okay, i will need some minutes to extract the example
[04:06:41] <talin> hello
[04:06:52] <talin> i am trying to use the datepicker method in jquery
[04:07:08] <talin> but i'm not sure if i have included what i need. i only have jquery.min.js
[04:07:21] <talin> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery\
[04:07:22] <talin> /1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[04:07:26] <confounds> talin did you read the docs
[04:07:34] <phil-adept> talin, you need jquery ui as well
[04:07:37] <talin> confounds: i read the datepicker page, but it doesn't say anything about it
[04:07:48] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: okay. http://pastebin.com/Y90b9u1s this is the main page, im loading http://pastebin.com/pUVTuBsZ into the <div id="content">
[04:08:19] <phil-adept> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[04:08:30] <phil-adept> In the tabbed section mid way down the page it says:
[04:08:34] <phil-adept> Dependencies: UI COre
[04:08:40] <beasty> hmm
[04:08:52] <beasty> talin: and where is the datepicker page located ?
[04:09:03] <vpv4oo> when i put the exact map code from the second paste into welcome.php which is included by default, it works. when its loaded into div id="content" via jQuery, the map remains blank but the controls are visible
[04:11:26] <talin> beasty: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[04:11:36] <vpv4oo> jQuery loading via $('#content').fadeOut('fast').load('map.php').hide().fadeIn('fast');
[04:11:36] <talin> but i did find another getting started page there
[04:11:40] <talin> that explains it, i think
[04:11:57] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: can you send maputil.js?
[04:12:11] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: sure, 1 sec
[04:12:40] <talin> up until now i've included jquery with a link to ajax.googleapis.com, but i guess with jquery ui, i have to download it
[04:13:24] <beasty> talin: not really
[04:13:28] <phil-adept> talin: jquery UI is still available on a CDN
[04:13:52] <beasty> talin: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[04:14:03] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: http://pastebin.com/vz1J5aUb
[04:14:11] <phil-adept> http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[04:14:19] <phil-adept> lol @ beasty... too quick
[04:14:25] <phil-adept> cheers vpv4oo
[04:14:42] <beasty> i'm fast :)
[04:16:05] <phil-adept> beasty: I bet you're women are happy :D lol
[04:16:39] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: Right, I've got the map page rendering on my machine, just going to try to reproduce your problem
[04:17:27] <bla> Is it possible to define some global CSS? For an element which changes?
[04:18:52] <phil-adept> bla: more info needed
[04:19:06] <bla> phil-adept, this works: $('body').append('<style>a.jedn_info {display: none; }</style>');
[04:19:09] <bla> phil-adept, is it sane?
[04:19:28] <bla> phil-adept, I was thinking about some clever .css() usage, but I can't 'select' the item.
[04:19:37] <phil-adept> live()
[04:19:50] <phil-adept> although I think it's deprecated... 1 sec
[04:20:03] <bla> I can use .on() but I've got no idea if it alters CSS as well
[04:20:11] <bla> .live is deprecated since 1.7 I guess
[04:20:14] <phil-adept> I'm not sure I understand...
[04:20:32] <bla> I don't want to handle an event. ;) I want to hide element, always. It should be never shown.
[04:20:32] <phil-adept> bla yeah I thought it had been .on() is the new equivilent
[04:20:43] <phil-adept> and you can';t target it within CSS?...
[04:20:52] <DEac-> i have a plugin, which interact with an <select>. the plugin triggers change, but it has an eventhandler 'change' too. how i can prevent, that this own eventhandlers will be called?
[04:20:55] <bla> No, it's a part of AJAX loaded table which reloads from time to time.
[04:21:12] <phil-adept> .hide()
[04:21:23] <bla> phil-adept, .hide() requires selecting an element. Doesn't it?
[04:21:39] <bla> phil-adept, I need .on()/.live() but one which works with CSS - in a nutshell.
[04:22:12] <bla> on('new element appears that matches selector', function() {$(this).hide();} );
[04:22:18] <bla> Something like that, but I doubt it's possible.
[04:22:25] <phil-adept> bla, that's your problem then... CSS needs to have an element SELECTED... you're saying you can't selec the item?
[04:22:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Can you or anyone else help out anymore on this please: http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/index.php?topic=355683.0
[04:22:55] <fRAiLtY-> It is a jQuery thing despite the URL
[04:22:55] <bla> phil-adept, I can, but it doesn't exist; I can select it with CSS selector - not jquery
[04:23:08] <bla> phil-adept, maybe restating approach:
[04:23:32] <phil-adept> so if you camn select it within css why not just use display:none within your css?
[04:23:36] <bla> phil-adept, can I do $('body').css('.someclass_of_other_element { display:none;}');
[04:24:14] <bla> CSS is common for all pages and this element has to be hidden on one page. This generally is dreadfully bad designed, hence my combinations.
[04:24:43] <phil-adept> bla: it's difficult to imagine without seeing something. Have you got anything to show to help explain your problem?
[04:25:10] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: the part that would be missing for you is probably menu1.php, simply a textlink on top of the page with id="foo", and in the head <script type="text/javascript" src="menu.js"></script> containing $('#foo').bind({click: function(){ $('#content').fadeOut('fast').load('map.php').hide().fadeIn('fast'); } });
[04:25:12] <bla> It's pretty simple, I'm just explaining it in a complicated way I guess.
[04:25:38] <_Sn0w> Hey, i am wondering how to add a widtch function to this
[04:25:39] <_Sn0w> 	      <div id="chat_expander" class='hide'>
[04:25:39] <_Sn0w>          <button onclick="$('#chat').css('height', '600px');">-</button>
[04:25:39] <_Sn0w>          <button onclick="$('#chat').css('height', '800px');">+</button>
[04:25:39] <_Sn0w>       </div>
[04:25:49] <_Sn0w> so it will resize the width as well
[04:26:11] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: and two files welcome.php and map.php with the mapcode on pastebin
[04:27:27] <DEac-> http://jsfiddle.net/DenKn/qwpms/ < recursive change-trigger
[04:29:55] <soc42> hi #jquery
[04:29:59] <phil-adept> _Sn0w: http://api.jquery.com/css/
[04:30:28] <phil-adept> _Sn0w: pass the multiple attr's as an object to .css()
[04:30:51] <phil-adept> yeah cheers vpv :)
[04:32:24] <soc42> i have a form and choose to .focus() a field if on select box changes to a particular value, but the fields focus background color stays even if i choose another field after the auto-selected one
[04:34:41] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: I notice you don't have much of your JS wrapped within anything like $(document).ready(function(){ ... });
[04:34:55] <phil-adept> that 'could' be causing issues with dynamic loading
[04:36:33] <_Sn0w> phil
[04:36:44] <_Sn0w> is it possible to auto excute this code??
[04:36:45] <_Sn0w> 		      <div id="chat_expander" class='hide'>
[04:36:45] <_Sn0w>   
[04:36:45] <_Sn0w>          <button onclick="$('#chat').css('height', '425px');">+</button>
[04:36:45] <_Sn0w>          <button onclick="$('#chat').css('width', '535px');">+</button>
[04:36:45] <_Sn0w>       </div>
[04:36:56] <_Sn0w> instead of having to "onclick"
[04:38:09] <rzec> is there any reason why this works : $(this).siblings('.acl-entities-wrap').slice(0, 1).children('ul') : but this does not : $(this).siblings('.acl-entities-wrap ul') : ?
[04:38:55] <AdvoWork> I've got something which is failing because it cannot read the property 'length' of null on oTable.fnGetColumnData(j).length   Whats the best way to test for that?
[04:39:28] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: at the moment i have the jQuery code above wrapped in $(function(){   }); ... should i try the $(document).ready(f... anyways?
[04:41:23] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: The errors I get within FireBug are:....
[04:41:26] <phil-adept> OpenLayers is not defined
[04:41:26] <phil-adept> [Break On This Error] 	
[04:41:27] <phil-adept> map.addControl(new OpenLayers.Control.ScaleLine);
[04:43:13] <_Sn0w> Hey can anyone help me auto execute the jquery?
[04:43:18] <_Sn0w> is that possible
[04:43:23] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: thats weird, if i remove that line, the ScaleLine on the bottom of the map vanishes. simply one of OpenLayers controls that seems to work/disappear
[04:43:58] <_Sn0w> this is the code i want to run on the webpage without having to click a button http://pastebin.com/n9UajmcH
[04:44:48] <AdvoWork> I'm doing:  if (aData.length){ but it still says: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null  any suggestions pleae?
[04:46:11] <Cork> AdvoWork: so aData is null
[04:46:30] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: is that error gone if you delete that ScaleLine-addControl line? if so, just leave it out, doesnt matter
[04:46:45] <Cork> AdvoWork: try if(aData && aData.length > 0)
[04:48:31] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: $(document).ready(function(){   }); as a wrapper didnt solve it :/
[04:49:29] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: I know, I'm checking that now. I think there are clashes with the $ declaration in both libs. I think jQuery and openlayers.utils.js are fighting over it
[04:49:33] <vpv4oo> if i would make a wild guess, id say its some kind of loading timeout where the jQuery loading is aborted after a defined period of time / point in code, even if some things have not loaded yet
[04:49:57] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: Well, I've made progress anyway. Just checking a few things now
[04:50:14] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: thanks a lot for looking at it
[04:52:09] <_Antony> ARG!
[04:55:03] <ericTaff> I'm reading 14 Helpful jQuery Tricks on nettuts (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/14-helpful-jquery-tricks-notes-and-best-practices/) and have got a syntax question:
[04:55:06] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: How recent is this openlayers lib you have? Is it the latest?
[04:55:45] <ericTaff> what happens here? var someDivs = $('#container').find('.someDivs'), contents = [];
[04:56:19] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: yes, in contrast to the jQuery used its the latest
[04:56:44] <ericTaff> i don't get the comma-part
[04:57:32] <Aamir> ericTaff:  its like defining multiple variables with one var :|
[04:58:05] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: Is there a reason it has to be pulled viz AJAX?..
[04:58:09] <phil-adept> via*
[04:59:41] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: yeah, design reasons of the whole page... i only want to load the head, footer etc once, only reload the content in #content... its just more comfortable having the menu not reloaded on every single click, only the content
[05:00:20] <ericTaff> how could I rewrite it? var someDivs = $(''container').find('.someDivs'); var someDivs = contents = [];  that doesn't make sense to me
[05:01:11] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: well is the map 'required' on each page?
[05:01:12] <Cork> ericTaff: var someDivs = $('#container').find('.someDivs'), contents = []; is the same as
[05:01:19] <Cork> var someDivs = $('#container').find('.someDivs'); var contents = [];
[05:01:37] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: no, only on one of the menu-items' pages
[05:02:04] <phil-adept> ok, so you don't want to load the required lib's until you require them on a page. Getcha, 1 sec
[05:05:42] <mindis|wurk> can anyone think of a good way to merge neighboring textnodes?
[05:06:25] <talin> i am trying to use datepicker with a non-english language. so i do: $("#id_ror_oppgravd_dato").datepicker($.datepicker.regional['no']);
[05:06:29] <talin> i have installed the language file, but it doesn't work
[05:06:32] <talin> any ideas?
[05:21:50] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: I cannot get this working for the life of me
[05:22:21] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: same here, i wonder whats wrong. can you reproduce the error? as in the map not loading?
[05:22:42] <vpv4oo> and loading when its directly included...
[05:24:30] <vpv4oo> since a client had a problem with my jQuery loads, where his router was sometimes not loading the pages, but after a while displaying an abortion error page that loaded instead of the page-content, i asumed its maybe a timeout setting somewhere
[05:24:57] <vpv4oo> (abortion error page delivered by his routing hardware)
[05:25:41] <vpv4oo> but then again, the jQuery used isnt really over-complicated. if it doesnt work with this simple case, why would it work anywhere overall
[05:26:35] <phil-adept> yeah I have it working when called directly, when you introduce ajax loading and jquery it doesn't like it and says openlayers.map is undefined. I've tried using .getScript() to ensure all lib's are loaded before execution and wrapped within $(document).ready(function(){...}); At the moment I think it's due to how things are being called however I'm trying to figure this friggin lib out.. It's
[05:26:35] <phil-adept> not nice
[05:27:37] <Qalqi> how to select nth element in a selector
[05:27:39] <Qalqi> ?
[05:28:42] <bla> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[05:29:29] <bla> You can always do $( $('selector')[n] ) too.
[05:30:33] <erichynds> bla: also known as eq()
[05:30:51] <bla> oh, right.
[05:31:52] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: but if you say the problem is definitely in the openLayers API, i will try switching to another one. just have to find out if its free to use http://api.maps.ovi.com/
[05:35:58] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: Even with their most basic example I get the error
[05:36:40] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: You had your map page with <html> and <head> tags. As it's not an iFrame you can't redeclare <HTML> or <HEAD> btw :)
[05:38:27] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: is the jQuery-code i provided still valid in the most recent release? if so, switching to it might improve... oh, sorry.. in the originals the included map.php and welcome.php do not contain one more <head> or <html>... but the originals are structured to confusing to be helpful as an example for this case, so i rewrote everything and made that mistake
[05:41:55] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: I'll explain what I've tried
[05:42:05] <phil-adept> I've stripped everything back to it's most basic form
[05:42:18] <phil-adept> http://pastie.org/3600649
[05:42:23] <phil-adept> I'll explain as I go along :D
[05:42:46] <phil-adept> take a look at that file and see if you can understand what I've done
[05:43:32] <vpv4oo> youve reduced everything into one js-snippet
[05:43:38] <vpv4oo> nice
[05:43:56] <phil-adept> kinda yeah, but had to get each lib loading before the next to ensure everything loads in the right place
[05:44:50] <phil-adept> then I have test.js which was just to check that getScript() has worked and that the var's / function within are accessible later in teh execution
[05:44:51] <phil-adept> http://pastie.org/3600652
[05:45:02] <phil-adept> all it does is output to the console
[05:45:06] <phil-adept> very basic
[05:45:34] <phil-adept> And then the last file is the map.html you wanted to call
[05:45:35] <phil-adept> http://pastie.org/3600654
[05:46:09] <vpv4oo> you just call the mapdrawing function like that inside of jquery... its very helpful for me to see this
[05:46:27] <AdvoWork> console.log(oTable.fnGetColumnData(8).length); shows 119, yet console.log(oTable.fnGetColumnData(9).length);  is basically giving: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null.  I've tried doing:    if(oTable.fnGetColumnData(9) > 0) { but it still gives the same error.  Any ideas please?
[05:46:43] <phil-adept> to be fair, you don't need to do it this way. You can do it all in one execution block really
[05:47:25] <phil-adept> I think loading it via AJAX is introducing problems. If you load the scripts you require when the map is called, you can display a "loading" message whilst it grabs the lib's renders and output
[05:48:18] <vpv4oo> would it work if i would load the libs in the main header from the beginning?
[05:48:20] <phil-adept> no ajax calls are really required since you're targeting an element in the DOM already and generating new content to replace it's current content through the openlayers output
[05:48:30] <phil-adept> I'm going to see now :)
[05:50:35] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: http://pastie.org/3600649
[05:51:14] <vpv4oo> youre calling testInit(); and in the map.php its called init(); but thats probably not the exact versions as you tried them
[05:51:59] <phil-adept> init() is the function required to render the map. The testInit() was to check that it was indeed calling functions containined in lib's loaded using getScript() :)
[05:52:21] <phil-adept> if you switch testInit() for init() in the jquery it will try to render the map and fail :)
[05:52:36] <vpv4oo> ahh okay
[05:52:39] <phil-adept> that last file I sent you is all you would really need
[05:52:47] <phil-adept> I've consolidated everything onto one page
[05:53:26] <phil-adept> oops... I was using a local copy of jquery on that!
[05:53:33] <phil-adept> http://pastie.org/3600649
[05:53:45] <phil-adept> That's with the correct jqery link
[05:57:17] <vpv4oo> what did you have in test.js?
[06:02:21] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: I think I have got it...
[06:02:23] <phil-adept> 1 sec
[06:03:53] <phil-adept> one of the issues is that the content you want the map to be placed has to be visible at the start. If it's hidden using .hide() the lib can't work out it's size
[06:06:38] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: ah jeez... thats why it was drawing that little black square in the corner
[06:08:54] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: http://pastie.org/3600649
[06:10:11] <phil-adept> That's everything in one file, with very little extra code. If you look at it and see if you can understand it. You need to replace lines 41-49 with your specific code and all should work. You need to add a "loading" pre-loader or similar as there is a bit of time before the map is generated :)
[06:10:40] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: and no ajax! :D
[06:10:54] <phil-adept> back in 5 I need coffee now lol
[06:14:03] <spiffytech> Why might this return a 1-element array containing a DOM object instead of the DOM object itself? There's only one element on the page with this ID: jQuery("#webhook_rollup")
[06:15:29] <Cork> spiffytech: jquery is an array like object
[06:15:41] <Cork> and it always return a jquery object
[06:15:52] <Cork> if you want the dom object use jQuery("#webhook_rollup")[0]
[06:16:48] <MagmaRules> Guys for some reason my jquery ui tabs, when i remove them and add them again, start jumping to the anchor links. Should i remove the tabs in some special way ?
[06:17:07] <phil-adept> back
[06:18:40] <phil-adept> MagmaRules: when you add an element it won't have the correct events bound to it so nothing will fire.
[06:19:25] <jeffkiesel> nick jekie
[06:19:33] <Flo0815> hi everyone
[06:19:35] <jeffkiesel> hi all quick question
[06:19:36] <MagmaRules> phil-adept: they do work. But they will jump to the href also. Only happens when i do something like $(tabs).remove() and then recreate the tabs
[06:20:20] <jeffkiesel> i have $(this) being passed to a function.  i'd like to verify what $(this) is.  $(this).tagName doe not work.  what can i do to determine the type of tag it is?
[06:20:50] <phil-adept> MagmaRules: getcha. like the function doesn't call event.preventDefault() or returns false?
[06:20:53] <Flo0815> blackspotwiggins: thx 4 ur help with the ajax thing yesterday, it works now!
[06:21:07] <phil-adept> jeffkiesel: typeof?
[06:21:21] <jeffkiesel> phil-adept: i will try that
[06:21:30] <blackspotwiggins> Flo710,  np. so it was ajax after all?
[06:21:33] <MagmaRules> phil-adept: ok i solved it by removing the parent element instead of the tabs. Jquery must be storing something related to that element.
[06:21:53] <Flo0815> blackspotwiggins: i think so, i replaced the stuff with the jquery ajax function, and it's fine now
[06:22:10] <Flo0815> blackspotwiggins: never thought of that...:(
[06:22:42] <phil-adept> magma, could be. I'm confused why .tabs( "remove" ) or .tabs ( "add" ) didn't work correctly for you though?
[06:23:23] <MagmaRules> phil-adept: unn didn't try those.
[06:24:09] <phil-adept> MagmaRules: Sorry, I misread your post. I read "$(tabs).remove()" and thought you had used the methods for .tabs()
[06:24:11] <MagmaRules> phil-adept: i didn't read that part in the doc, assumed that you had always to say the index of the tab =)
[06:24:30] <phil-adept> MagmaRules: You do!
[06:24:32] <MagmaRules> phil-adept: I'm guessing that that would be a smarter way to do it =)
[06:24:40] <MagmaRules> ohh ok
[06:24:42] <MagmaRules> =)
[06:25:18] <phil-adept> MagmaRules: you still have to pass the index of the tab you wish to remove. I typicall add an ID to each tab and then get the position of the element in the .tabs() from that :)
[06:25:27] <MagmaRules> ok
[06:26:11] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: Did that work for you?
[06:26:45] <vpv4oo> phil-adept: yeah it works! epic! thanks very much!!!
[06:27:15] <vpv4oo> still fiddling it into the site :)
[06:28:58] <phil-adept> vpv4oo: No worries, glad to help
[06:37:08] <gst123> hi to every 1
[06:37:21] <kujon> Hi there. I'm extracting a text from html element and then I want to split it into array like this --> text.split('\n')
[06:37:52] <gst123> i need ur help guys
[06:38:28] <gst123> {
[06:38:30] <gst123> "id" : 100000,
[06:38:32] <gst123> "title": "some title",
[06:38:34] <gst123> "fieldgroups" :[
[06:38:36] <gst123> 		{ "title" : "titletext",
[06:38:38] <gst123> 		  "fields" : [
[06:38:39] <kujon> the problem is it won't work with jquery extracted text. ('some \n text').split('\n') works just fine, but $(element).text().split('\n') doesn't
[06:38:40] <gst123> 		      { "id" : "id1",
[06:38:41] <gst123> 			    "label" : "some text",
[06:38:43] <gst123> 				"type" : "text1"
[06:38:45] <gst123> 			  },
[06:38:46] <gst123> 			  { "id" : "id1",
[06:38:48] <gst123> 			    "label" : "some text",
[06:38:50] <gst123> 				"type" : "text1"
[06:38:51] <gst123> 			  },
[06:38:53] <gst123> 			  { "id" : "id1",
[06:38:54] <gst123> 			    "label" : "some text",
[06:39:24] <Cork> ...
[06:39:56] <kujon> i you guys could help, I'd be very thankful
[06:40:24] <Cork> kujon: whats in the extacted text look like
[06:40:37] <Cork> you sure its not something like <br> or \\n ?
[06:40:44] <gst123> in that i want to dispaly 10 contents per page
[06:40:58] <Cork> ?p @ gst123
[06:40:58] <gst123> i have a array of array of json file
[06:40:58] <bot-t> gst123, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:41:03] <kujon> yep, i'm sure
[06:41:08] <gst123> n that i want to dispaly 10 contents per page
[06:41:08] <fatguylaughing> Anyone know of a JQuery slider (rotator) that doesn't have to load all the pictures at once, but instead uses say AJAX to load as needed?
[06:41:14] <Cork> gst123: never paste multible rows in the channel
[06:41:22] <gst123> k k
[06:41:35] <Cork> kujon: then split should work just fine
[06:41:44] <gst123> hey i have a array of array json file
[06:42:00] <MagmaRules> Is there an automatic way i can make jquery ui tabs content to adjust to the height of the content (excluding the tabs themselves) ?
[06:42:10] <Cork> kujon: what your trying to do isn't a problem, so it all comes down to whats in the string you get from text()
[06:42:17] <gst123> in that i want display 10 datas per page
[06:42:32] <AdvoWork> I'f im doing: $("#filter_row th").each( function ( i ) { } which works but misses the last column out, because its hidden, how can I basically do .each + 1?
[06:42:36] <gst123> using jquery
[06:43:17] <Cork> AdvoWork: hidden shouldn't matter there
[06:43:39] <Cork> AdvoWork: each will loop over every element in the selector, you can't loop everyone +1
[06:43:54] <AdvoWork> Cork, its for datatables, so bVisible doesn't even show it in the Dom afaik
[06:44:14] <Cork> AdvoWork: how would it then be able to access it?
[06:44:17] <AdvoWork> so in all terms, .each is doing what it should be, its because the column isn't actually there
[06:44:47] <AdvoWork> Cork, actually, in theory if its not being show, the .each should still be picking up all columns
[06:44:53] <kujon> Cork: Text extracted through jquery contains '\n'. If it didn't that definetely wouldn't be a problem
[06:45:05] <Cork> AdvoWork: it will as long as the element is in dom
[06:45:15] <Cork> if its not appended to dom, then no it won't
[06:45:22] <Cork> AdvoWork: visible or not doesn't matter
[06:45:28] <gst123> hey i have a array of array json file...in that i read all json file data and display 10 data's per page.............pls help me

[06:46:38] <Eising> hey there
[06:47:09] <Cork> gst123: an array of json files? what do you mean by that?
[06:48:31] <Eising> I'm doing some changes to a webapp I've done in jquery. I'm a routing where I insert some stuff on the page by the click of a button. Instead of defining the elements to be inserted in the js file, I'm using a ajax .get function to load it from a dynamic page. However, after I load the elements, I hide some elements by matching them through $(). Before, when I was just inserting from a string in the js file, it worked fine, now it doesn't.
[06:48:41] <kujon> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/YjJ2r/2/ just open up a console and see the results
[06:48:42] <Eising> I can manually hide the elements, though
[06:49:16] <Eising> I was thinking if I needed to set some sort of timer in to allow the ajax request to load fully before hiding the elements, or am I wrong?
[06:49:53] <LukeNukem> can someone tell me how i can add www to this
[06:49:53] <LukeNukem> var linkprefix = string.match(/(http:\/\/\S+)/);
[06:49:55] <ajpiano> Eising: you don't use timers for that, you use the ajax callback
[06:49:59] <Cork> kujon: \n in html isn't the same as \n in js
[06:50:16] <Cork> kujon: \n in html is the same as \\n in js string
[06:50:24] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: you have ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD to learn these things. i'm beginning to think your continued presence here is doing you a disservice
[06:50:32] <Cork> kujon: http://jsfiddle.net/YjJ2r/3/

[06:51:34] <Cork> but you get the idea
[06:51:58] <nFFF> LukeNukem, can't you figure it out, its not hard, '\' escapes the character so your regex is pretty simple once you learn that
[06:52:35] <kujon> Cork: thanks again, works just fine now
[06:52:36] <mxo> hi
[06:52:51] <rembo10> hey - a bit new to jquery and can't figure this outâ¦. what's the best way to disable the submit button on my form unless both username & password validate? http://pastebin.com/CYPP8vYr
[06:53:02] <LukeNukem> nFFF, no i haven't been getting any , wel lyeah in the first but now i dont.
[06:53:30] <ajpiano> LukeNukem: you know there are multiple regex testing sites on line
[06:53:35] <ajpiano> and you can go on there and experiment
[06:53:43] <nFFF> LukeNukem, that regex is so simple, it's like something 2 minutes of reading could figure out
[06:53:51] <Flo0815> rembo10: $('#submit').click(function(){return false;});
[06:54:21] <Flo0815> rembo10: insert your validation before the return false;
[06:54:38] <ajpiano> 2 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever. LukeNukem the point is, you have all the time in the world to experiment and learn and learn things thoroughly, stop using IRC as a crutch
[06:56:43] <rembo10> should it be in $(document).ready(function()? i'm used to python so i'm not sure how to pass variables :-)

[06:57:12] <mxo> this is the simple code: http://pastebin.com/8yYVBKqn

[06:57:35] <mxo> it works with one word only... i cant find how fix it to search with multiple keyword
[06:57:40] <mxo> anyone can help me?
[06:57:50] <mxo> i think the problem is the .val() function
[06:58:02] <mxo> which gets only the first parameter (as described in documentation)
[06:58:09] <mxo> but i cant find another method to use
[06:58:11] <rembo10> oh - awesome, will give it a try

[07:13:18] <TimothyA> this is still not helping me
[07:14:58] <Trisox> ? new Date()
[07:14:59] <bot-t> Trisox, #8671 (.parseJSON can't decode a new Date)  jQuery Core - Bug ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8671
[07:15:09] <TimothyA> Trisox: ...
[07:15:13] <Trisox> wyt
[07:15:15] <Trisox> what
[07:15:20] <TimothyA> I am trying to get the CURRENTLY DISPLAYED date
[07:15:24] <TimothyA> not the current date
[07:15:42] <Trisox> so set it to an INPUT! and use val()
[07:16:27] * TimothyA bangs his head on the wall
[07:16:32] <fRAiLtY-> Guys: http://jsfiddle.net/4YYTL/ Select option 1 (300gsm gloss) shows table 1 (id="300gsm Gloss) and hides the other, and vice versa
[07:16:35] <TimothyA> if I could do that; Then I would have had the date already!
[07:17:03] <Trisox> TimothyA: make an exampe in js fiddle then we talk furter it cant be hard your over thinking it
[07:17:27] <TimothyA> no, it's a piece of crap
[07:17:42] <TimothyA> it doesn't store the currently displayed day/month/year anywhere
[07:17:59] <TimothyA> ....
[07:18:01] <TimothyA> oh, there it is
[07:18:09] <TimothyA> way to hide, jquerytools :@
[07:18:15] <TimothyA> and not documenting it!
[07:18:17] <Trisox> this one  ?
[07:18:18] <Trisox> http://jquerytools.org/demos/dateinput/index.html
[07:18:28] <TimothyA> yes
[07:18:37] <TimothyA> oh wait no, that's when you *select* a date... grrr
[07:19:03] <Taloncor> pajo: 1: Why are u blocking the browser while waiting for the request
[07:19:03] <Taloncor> 2: That maybe a scope issue. The callback functions from $.ajax won't change the status value from your ajaxfunction
[07:19:34] <TimothyA> https://github.com/jquerytools/jquerytools/blob/master/src/dateinput/dateinput.js and here's the sourcecode, which they mention on the website, but don't link
[07:19:36] <Trisox> you need before selecting
[07:20:44] <gst123> how to split 10 json data per page using jquery
[07:20:55] <TimothyA> Trisox: *yes*
[07:21:01] <TimothyA> e.g. just browsing the calendar
[07:21:05] <TimothyA> without picking a specific date
[07:21:06] <Flo0815> gst123: ?
[07:21:25] <TimothyA> like I just repeated several times already; I want to get the date that the calendar is currently displaying
[07:21:36] <mxo> thanks a lot guys for support!
[07:21:42] <mxo> see you soon!
[07:22:09] <antdillon> Hi, how did I find if an element has a p in it? i.e: http://jsfiddle.net/RPxn4/

[07:23:12] <gst123> its possible
[07:25:05] <Flo0815> gst123: post your code in jsfiddle.net
[07:25:13] <gst123> @Flo0815......see here my json file format...........http://jsfiddle.net/x4eXB/
[07:26:52] <Taloncor> antdillon: Exactly the way you are doing it. With has()
[07:27:25] <Henkiepeng> hello all - i want to use jquery to put the value from a input area to a variable http://jsfiddle.net/6pXDh/1/ but it isnt working - the alert that i get is empty, TLDR: How do i put the value from a input into a variable u sing JQ?
[07:27:26] <antdillon> Taloncor, How do I get an true or false from it? its returning an object
[07:27:32] <gst123> @Flo0815......see here my js file which am currently workin...........http://jsfiddle.net/bkjR4/
[07:27:42] <erichynds> antdillon: use .val() instead of html()
[07:28:09] <antdillon> erichynds, im not using html()
[07:28:11] <fRAiLtY-> nFFF: Here's my jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/4YYTL/
[07:28:17] <erichynds> sorry, that was for gst123
[07:28:44] <Flo0815> gst123: u want to split the fields and put them in different fcontents?
[07:28:50] <Taloncor> antdillon: If you really need a true/false use length
[07:29:47] <gst123> ya i want to display 10 fields per page with one continue button
[07:30:12] <Taloncor> antdillon: But you would be better of to just apply the changes to your selected elements (see http://jsfiddle.net/RPxn4/1/ )
[07:30:13] <gst123> @Flo0815......ya i want to display 10 fields per page with one continue button
[07:30:45] <Flo0815> gst123: so u need to append different wrapper containing the data. only the first is displayed
[07:31:09] <Flo0815> gst123: if u click on "continue, the current wrapper will be hidden, and the next should be shown

[07:32:13] <antdillon> Taloncor, thanks I need it in an if statement but ill try use length
[07:32:18] <nFFF> ok yea, so your could won't work
[07:32:20] <nFFF> ?eq
[07:32:21] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[07:32:31] <nFFF> Your first supplying .eq with a string
[07:32:39] <nFFF> of characters, which won't work
[07:33:06] <phil-adept> http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/javascript-debugging-beginners
[07:33:12] <Flo0815> gst123: so add a if(count > 10) {element = '#fcontent' + fcontentcount; fcontentcount++; $(element).append ...}
[07:33:31] * phil-adept believes a lot of people can help themselves by reading that link
[07:33:49] <gst123> @Flo0815.....am not get fully
[07:33:51] <nFFF> fRAiLtY-, is the top table 300gsm, and boittom 400gsm?
[07:33:56] <fRAiLtY-> nFFF: Yes
[07:33:57] <nFFF> Or random rows of each
[07:33:58] <fRAiLtY-> They have ID's
[07:34:08] <fRAiLtY-> table 1 = id="300gsm Flyers"
[07:34:09] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-, you have spaces between your words in teh ID
[07:34:16] <phil-adept> invalid
[07:34:22] <phil-adept> 300gsm_Flyers
[07:34:31] <phil-adept> or 300gsm-Flyers
[07:34:34] <fRAiLtY-> Ok so I'll make them like that, but still..
[07:34:42] <nFFF> fRAiLtY-
[07:34:43] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/4YYTL/1/
[07:34:58] <nFFF> You need to check all your variables, and what they return, becuase they aren't what you think
[07:35:53] <TimothyA> Trisox: can't find anything eihter?
[07:36:08] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-:  your also declaring <SCRIPT> in the JS you need to remove that
[07:36:53] <fRAiLtY-> nFFF: My bad, fixed.
[07:36:55] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-: your mixing $() and jquery()
[07:37:07] <fRAiLtY-> I'm not, nFFF changed that
[07:37:07] <gst123> @Flo0815.....am not get properly ..........pls modify my code and past it in jsfiddle.net
[07:37:21] <phil-adept> you've got a lot wrong in what you're supplying
[07:37:24] <nFFF> Yea Im typing in $ :>
[07:37:24] <TimothyA> there has to be a way to get at currMonth
[07:37:32] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/4YYTL/2/
[07:38:06] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-: There, stripped down to the basics. I'm sure you can figure the rest out, and if not, maybe you've bitten off more than you can chew on teh project
[07:39:28] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-: Just a word of advice. Visiting different example sites, cutting and pasting things together and crossing your fingers isn't developing. You need to understand how things work fundamentily before trying. There's loads of help online and on here, but help us to help you :D
[07:40:16] <gst123> @Flo0815........help me how to do..........
[07:41:01] <nFFF> fRAiLtY- theres actually a lot wrong with this
[07:41:13] <nFFF> I just looked at your mark up, it#s invalid
[07:41:18] <fRAiLtY-> Please elaborate?
[07:41:21] <nFFF> You can't have multiple ID's
[07:41:25] <nFFF> Or you shouldn't
[07:41:32] <phil-adept> nff, fRAiLtY-, I've explained all this....
[07:41:35] <phil-adept>  read above
[07:41:50] <nFFF> :>
[07:41:57] <nFFF> 300gsm Gloss is a valid ID
[07:42:00] <nFFF> isnt
[07:42:11] <fRAiLtY-> Yes I can change that, that's fine
[07:42:32] <nFFF> Ok, well change it then?
[07:42:38] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-, read all my abopve comments... There's a fixed version for you and I've explained everything you have done wrong
[07:42:53] <gst123> @Flo0815........anyway thankzzzzzzzzzz for reply me
[07:43:05] <nFFF> phil-adept, your version doesn't work
[07:43:09] <nFFF> it hides both
[07:43:13] <pajo> why does my getMessage function always return an empty string? http://pastebin.com/XN3HgL1R
[07:43:19] <phil-adept> nff, I've not done it all for him, check the console...
[07:43:43] <nFFF> He needs to actually do this: $(this+':selected').text()
[07:43:45] <nFFF> No pihl
[07:43:47] <nFFF> One sec
[07:43:48] <Henkiepeng> hello all - i want to use jquery to put the value from a input area to a variable http://jsfiddle.net/6pXDh/1/ but it isnt working - the alert that i get is empty, TLDR: How do i put the value from a input into a variable u sing JQ?
[07:43:50] <phil-adept> nFFF, like I said, stripped back down to the basics.
[07:43:53] <fRAiLtY-> phil-adept: I didn't visit example sites, other than the one that produced the drop downs as frankly I couldn't be bothered to type them. The tables are copied/pasted out of my script. The jQuery I had was written for me by this channel.
[07:43:55] <phil-adept> He needs the value of the selected option
[07:44:01] <nFFF> He needs to re-work his markup etc
[07:44:03] <phil-adept> it displays it in the console
[07:44:17] <nFFF> No he doesn't as the value doesn't correspond to the id of the tables
[07:44:26] <nFFF> He needs the markup to match
[07:45:05] <adept>  fRAiLtY-: if you didn't use example sites, why are the values for your seelct objects that of cars??... IE Volvo and Saab?...
[07:45:18] <ronvanb> Greetings, I'm having some problems with jQuery acces denied script 70 in Internet explorer. i have tested multiple machines and i think IE9 is the problem. I tested the jquery site as wel and same problem. If i reload the page everything works fine. I can edit the register of windows 7 and i get it to work. But that does not fix the problem for other IE9 users Everything is on the same domain. Does anyone no if there is a fix for IE u
[07:45:24] <nFFF> .eq(jQuery(this).val()).show() // doesn't do shit, one you can't pass astirng to eq()
[07:45:28] <fRAiLtY-> adept: Read my last comment and all will be revaled
[07:45:39] <stradade> hello i have a problem with a problem with a script i have already used and i can understand why can someone help me ?
[07:45:41] <nFFF> The whole code needs to be rethinked along with the markup
[07:45:48] <nFFF> Its a simple task,
[07:46:02] <nFFF> fRAiLtY-, you need to do some basic reading of HTML and then attack the problem again
[07:46:03] <stradade> hello i have a problem with a script i have already used and i cant understand why can someone help me ?
[07:46:25] <adept> fRAiLtY-:.... its very simple... look at what I sent you and I shall explain it
[07:47:40] <adept> in each of your <option> you have a value... This at the moment is set to either saab or volvo... Them figures will not work in your example. You need to either display the table with the same index as the selected option, or the one with the referenced ID (i.e. if the <option> value ="table_1"
[07:47:45] <cpaq> I have a form, with a validator plugin and a form handler: $("#SavingsCalculation").validate(); and handler:  $('#SavingsCalculation').submit(function() {event.preventDefault(); }  THing is, how do code it so that the submit() handler only happens if validitor is successfull.  I mean how does this validator work: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[07:47:56] <adept> fRAiLtY-
[07:48:08] <fRAiLtY-> adept: Yes?
[07:48:41] <fRAiLtY-> adept: Read: "I didn't visit example sites, other than the one that produced the drop downs as frankly I couldn't be bothered to type them."
[07:49:02] <fRAiLtY-> I copied and pasted them through laziness, not through inability
[07:49:03] <stradade> hello i have a problem with a script i have already used and i cant understand why can someone help me ?
[07:49:28] <adept> fRAiLtY-: that shows me you can't be bothered to help yourself so I'm struggling to figure out why I'm trying to get through to you...
[07:49:33] <adept> so listen...
[07:50:13] <fRAiLtY-> It's not about helping myself, I had a live site example and it was requested by nFFF to post basic markup into jsfiddle for testing purposes, that I did.
[07:50:30] <ronvanb> Is IE9 causing problems with script 70: acces denied for jquery??
[07:50:39] <fRAiLtY-> You're saying this is the core of my issue, and that I'm not aware of basic HTML, I am fully aware.
[07:51:03] * TimothyA bangs his head against this incompetence
[07:51:17] <nFFF> :DD
[07:51:42] <nFFF> fRAiLtY-, how are you fully aware? your mark up was totally wrong in the most basics of ways
[07:51:53] <fRAiLtY-> nFFF:  How ?
[07:51:59] <nFFF> Your id's were wrong...
[07:52:00] <adept> because in a nutshell, I have it working, and you don't, so if you need help, listenhttp://jsfiddle.net/4YYTL/3/
[07:52:00] <fRAiLtY-> The tables have just validated on W3C?
[07:52:05] <adept> http://jsfiddle.net/4YYTL/3/
[07:52:18] <fRAiLtY-> Because of an ID... earlier it was "my whole markup" ?
[07:52:32] <nFFF> whatever
[07:52:40] <nFFF> your attitude sux cuz
[07:53:50] <adept> fRAiLtY-: SO far I've seen a few things wrong. Invalid ID's, <SCRIPT> block in JS section on jsfiddle, example values given insteads of real values, the line you said "frankly I couldn't be bothered", mixing $() and jquery() and the fact you're being an arse and not letting others help
[07:54:03] <fRAiLtY-> Mixing $ was not me, read.
[07:54:26] <fRAiLtY-> Having never used jsfiddle I can also be excused for the <SCRIPT> tags ?
[07:55:06] <fRAiLtY-> So I'm guilty of invalid ID's, I apologise, and laziness whilst copy/pasting the select markup into jsfiddle, which is an example and not representative of my real situation.
[07:55:09] <fRAiLtY-> Correct?
[07:56:39] <adept> fRAiLtY-: look, what you supplied was flawed in many ways, all I'm saying is don't simply throw stuff together, scratch your head when it doesn't work and then expect others to help, especially when you say during that "you frankly coudn't be bothered". And if you ask for help, then listen. That's all I've got to say, anyway, I've given you a correct working example, I'm sure you can figure
[07:56:39] <adept> the rest out
[07:58:04] <gst123> i have a array of array json file..... so i need to append different wrapper containing the data. only the first is displayed.......
[07:58:06] <adept> I've spent 20 minus of my time when I should be working, trying to help you. When it's met with attitude and reluctance for one to help themselves it's disheartening for us which spoils it for others. As long as you've come away from something and learnt then thats all that matters
[07:58:13] <gst123> i have a array of array json file..... so i need to append different wrapper containing the data. only the first is displayed.......
[07:58:21] <gst123> if u click on "continue, the current wrapper will be hidden, and the next should be shown
[07:58:44] <nFFF> 'a array of array json file' sounds scary :D
[07:59:05] <ajpiano> gst123: i can safely assure you that no one is going to be able to help you here unless you do more work yourself
[07:59:12] <ajpiano> build an example, try doing it in jsfiddle or in a testing side
[07:59:13] <gst123> see here my json file format...........http://jsfiddle.net/x4eXB/
[07:59:14] <ajpiano> site*
[07:59:21] * adept +1 to gst123
[07:59:30] <ajpiano> no one is going to write this entire thing for you no matter how many times you write the same question repeatedly
[07:59:39] <cpaq> you know the validator plugin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation, well it says that form submission is prevented unless the form validates, but I think it doesn't work if you use the .submit() handler any know what to do in this case, cause I need to use server script, I just want to do a calculation and change some value in the dom
[07:59:50] <fRAiLtY-> adept: What I supplied in terms of javascript was incorrect, hence why I'm here. My HTML had 1 error that has been pointed out so far, invalid ID's. I have already explained that I copied and pasted the drop-downs from W3Schools in a rush as nFFF asked me to supply basic markup to illustrate my problem as oppose to my real-life example which I supplied before that not being suitable. I have never used jsfiddle in my life so the script tags
[07:59:50] <fRAiLtY-> not something I was aware of, I apologise for these 2 things but was then met with drama about not knowing HTML, "whole markup needs rethinking" and other such exaggerations. By all means feel free to highlight the "many ways" that I personally have messed up and I'll be happy to listen and fix!
[07:59:53] * adept here, here ajpiano
[08:00:30] <ajpiano> adept: better to say it now otherwise he'll just be doing it all day long
[08:01:00] * ajpiano has seen this song and dance before
[08:01:44] <ajpiano> phew.
[08:02:14] <fRAiLtY-> i have a array of array json file....
[08:02:21] <stradade> sry if i have a text in a for called x when i submit form i have a ready funtion that try to take the post value of x ... i used var name = $("#x").val(); but don't work... could the position of this form is tha cause ????
[08:02:22] <ajpiano> ...go on
[08:02:33] <stradade> sry if i have a text in a html form called x when i submit form i have a ready funtion that try to take the post value of x ... i used var name = $("#x").val(); but don't work... could the position of this form is tha cause ????
[08:03:02] <fRAiLtY-> well it's odd ajpiano you wouldn't believe it but i need to append different wrapper containing the data, the problem is, only the first is displayed (lots of dots).
[08:03:37] <fRAiLtY-> adept: Meanwhile, I am extremely grateful for your working example and will adapt this for my needs, so thank you.
[08:03:39] <ajpiano> my favourite way to append a different wrapper is to go to the hip hop record store and put on some new tunes
[08:03:57] <fRAiLtY-> ajpiano: I shall try that in my array of array json, cheers
[08:03:58] <nFFF> :DD
[08:04:01] <stradade> sry if i have a text in a html form called x when i submit form i have a ready funtion that try to take the post value of x ... i used var name = $("#x").val(); but don't work... could the position of this form is tha cause ????
[08:04:03] <adept> fRAiLtY-: it's not a problem like I said. And I did point the problems out first hand, you must have missed my first posts :)
[08:04:33] <adept> fRAiLtY-: I have never stated how you have "personaly" messed up, however in terms of how you had flaws in your work I have already explained. And since you're hear wanting to get your own stuff working, I'm sure that that is the topic of conversation here, not how you personally messed up? :)
[08:04:51] <stradade> sry if i have a text in a html form called x when i submit form i have a ready funtion that try to take the post value of x ... i used var name = $("#x").val(); but don't work... could the position of this form is the cause ????
[08:05:04] <adept> fRAiLtY-: Like I said, you have your solution, you have now had experience with jsfiddle (which is great), you've learnt (hopefully) not to paste code to save time / coz you cant be arsed because it doesn't work and you've got your code working. Win - win situation mate
[08:05:43] <fRAiLtY-> adept: I agree, I just didn't appreciate the drama from some akin to the world is nigh (it's a space in an ID!) sort of stuff :)
[08:05:51] <fRAiLtY-> Whole markup = 1 line :)
[08:06:01] <fRAiLtY-> $ mixed with jQuery was nFFF 's fault :D
[08:06:03] <adept> fRAiLtY-: It wasn't my comment you will find ;)
[08:06:11] <fRAiLtY-> adept: I agree :)
[08:06:17] <fRAiLtY-> I'm summarising :)
[08:06:49] <xec> hi, i'd like to have an argument, please.
[08:06:58] <xec> is this the right place? :D
[08:07:02] <ajpiano> xec: screw off
[08:07:04] <fRAiLtY-> xec: You need to learn basic HTML first.
[08:07:16] <ajpiano> :D
[08:07:33] <fRAiLtY-> xec: Besides there's no argument :) me and adept  have sorted it now. It's nFFF 's fault :)
[08:07:42] <adept> xec: function ( yourArgument ){ console.log(yourArgument); }
[08:07:44] <xec> ajpiano: oh, this is "abuse"? :D
[08:09:09] <xec> fRAiLtY-: i'm just kidding of course, it's just that i read like two screens of this chat and didn't see anything constructive - i have no idea what the original issue was
[08:11:27] <stradade> i need help
[08:11:28] <stradade> pls
[08:11:30] <stradade> :(
[08:11:44] <stradade> if i have a text in a html form called x when i submit form i have a ready funtion that try to take the post value of x ... i used var name = $("#x").val(); but don't work... could the position of this form is the cause ????

[08:16:22] <stradade> i don't know if i do well
[08:17:03] <ajpiano> adept: awesome, we've needed one of those for years
[08:17:35] <pajo> what is wrong with this callback? http://pastebin.com/QPLxFttN
[08:18:00] <ajpiano> stradade: you need to do all this logic in the submit handler for your form, not a click on the button in your form
[08:18:20] <adept> stradade: yOU HAVE MOOTOOLS SELECTED AS THE LIB NOT jQUERY...
[08:18:26] <adept> Ooops... Caps, my bad
[08:18:47] <ajpiano> adept: you are gonna drive yourself up a wall... then across the ceilng, then back down the opposite wall, and then through the floor and straight to hell
[08:18:55] <ajpiano> if you expect everyone using jsfiddle the first time to do it right
[08:18:57] <adept> http://jsfiddle.net/aPTBY/2/
[08:19:37] <ajpiano> stradade: http://jsfiddle.net/aPTBY/3/
[08:20:09] <phil-adept> grrr
[08:20:14] <phil-adept> silly isp kicking me
[08:20:38] <phil-adept> ajpiano: it's a thankless job lol
[08:20:45] <ajpiano> amen
[08:21:52] <ajpiano> stradade: the difference is, as i said, that you use the submit event of a form
[08:22:02] <ajpiano> when you want to do stuff when the form is submitted and perhaps cancel the default
[08:22:19] <ajpiano> the click handler on the submit button is not the same as the submit event itself
[08:22:22] * phil-adept google +1's ajpiano's answer
[08:22:54] <Itrace> I need to animate a bunch of random bubbles flowing up the screen, in a straight line. Can anybody suggest where I could find an example of this already done. I'm not sure how to start.
[08:23:01] <stradade> i used this script and it work now i put it into <li>
[08:23:12] <stradade> and now don't work
[08:23:25] <ajpiano> stradade: what does that even mean
[08:23:28] <stradade> how is possible the problem is event type ?
[08:23:44] <phil-adept> Itrace: The term is sprite animation. There are a few plugins to help, try looking here too: http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-sprite-animation/
[08:23:50] <ajpiano> stradade: because you can't cancel a form submit from the click event on the button.
[08:24:13] <doup> hi there
[08:24:23] <Itrace> phil-adept: Thanks!
[08:24:33] <doup> i'm having an issue with encoding in yaml files
[08:24:36] <phil-adept> Itrace: I've used this before, it's nice :) http://spritely.net/
[08:25:33] <doup> i don't if someone has heard of a bug with utf8 in certain server conditions or whatever... the thing is that when cached config files are generated accents get messed up
[08:26:06] <doup> localhost_dev: 'Personalización'  VS server_prod: 'Personalizaci' . "\0" . '' . "\0" . 'n'
[08:26:12] <phil-adept> doup: it's not due to minimising / compressing on the output that's causing it is it?
[08:26:39] <phil-adept> or is it to do with malformed encoding?
[08:26:40] <doup> no no, i'm talking about the yaml files
[08:26:52] <stradade> ajpiano sry i think i don't explain fine cause my english is bad... i put some alert as u can see and the alert work the function work but i have a problem here $("#name").val(); when i read value
[08:27:03] <doup> the cached versions i'm talking about are the symfony generated ones (in cache folder)
[08:27:04] <stradade> ajpiano are empty
[08:27:27] <doup> obviously muste be some server issue, but i cant figure it out
[08:27:31] <phil-adept> stradade: my example I posted back alered the value?...
[08:27:35] <phil-adept> alerted*
[08:27:52] <stradade> ajpiano www.studiolegalebenincasa.it here u can test
[08:27:54] <phil-adept> if empty, the alert was empty, if it had a value it alerted the value?
[08:28:09] <ajpiano> stradade: i'm sorry but i don't have the time to deal with this language barrier right now
[08:29:10] <stradade> if i write innto textbox i have in the post empty value
[08:29:31] <phil-adept> stradade: http://jsfiddle.net/aPTBY/2/
[08:29:49] <phil-adept> stradade: that works fine?
[08:30:41] <nOStahl> hi guys
[08:31:17] <nOStahl> seems i ran into a jquery plugin once that would load images faster by pixels
[08:31:31] <nOStahl> i.e. low rez going clearer and clearer
[08:31:54] <phil-adept> stradade: Also you define var valid = 'Errore:'; at the start, and never clear it. Then at the end you check valid != '', which it will never be!
[08:32:18] <phil-adept> you mean progressive loading nOStahl?
[08:32:23] <nOStahl> ya
[08:32:29] <nOStahl> wasn't sure what to google for
[08:33:46] <RoosterJuice> anyone use jeditable?
[08:33:55] <phil-adept> nOStahl: no worries :)
[08:35:20] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/
[08:36:07] <cpaq> How do I make it so .submit() only runs if validator() plugin is success: http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/ ?
[08:36:54] <phil-adept> cpaq: There are a couple of errors in what you've given
[08:37:24] <phil-adept> cpaq: your not passing the event object on $('#SavingsCalculation').submit(function(){ ... });
[08:37:47] <cpaq> phil-adept, not sure what you mean?
[08:38:06] <phil-adept> cpaq: how are you wanting to submit the form? Regular post / get to page or ajax?
[08:39:03] <cpaq> http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/2/
[08:39:35] <cpaq> phidah, I don't want it to submit, I just want to use the value in the two inputs and then make some calculations, and then use .html() to changes some value in the dom
[08:40:11] <cpaq> phil-adept, , I don't want it to submit, I just want to use the value in the two inputs and then make some calculations, and then use .html() to changes some value in the dom
[08:40:24] <phil-adept> what inputs?..
[08:40:31] <phil-adept> there's just JS there?
[08:40:43] <cpaq> phil-adept, I updated it with the form
[08:40:50] <phil-adept> ah ok, 2 secs
[08:40:52] <cpaq> phil-adept, http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/2/
[08:41:40] <phil-adept> cpaq: you can see why I was confused, your using .submit() which implies you are submitting a form...  $('#SavingsCalculation').submit();
[08:42:29] <cpaq> phil-adept, is there a better way, rather than using submit?  because thing is, in order to use the validator I must use <form>
[08:44:08] <Mage_Dude> cpaq: Could you use a .click() on the button? Or attach a .on() [pretty similar]
[08:45:03] <cpaq> Mage_Dude, but then the validator won't run
[08:45:17] <phil-adept> cpaq http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/2/
[08:46:05] <cpaq> phidah, thats the same address I sent you, click update, and it should turn to 3
[08:46:59] <phil-adept> cpaq http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/3/ doesn't exist?
[08:47:10] <phil-adept> cpaq http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/2 is my version ;)
[08:47:32] <cpaq> phil-adept, did you click update?
[08:47:36] <phil-adept> sorry, it didn't save it
[08:47:40] <phil-adept> have now
[08:47:42] <phil-adept> http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/3/
[08:48:21] <Flo0815> hey can someone tell me the correct syntax for iterating ofer all li-elements but ignore the one that has the id "ignorethis" ?
[08:48:39] <cpaq> phil-adept, but there is no validator
[08:48:41] <Flo0815> i mean the css selector
[08:48:47] <xec> li:not(#ignorethis)
[08:49:00] <meekohi> What is the difference between $.ready, $(document).ready, and $(window).load, and which one should I be using?
[08:49:00] <xec> as the selector, could wok
[08:49:04] <phil-adept> Flo0815: You could do an .each() on the elements and if( $(this).attr('id') != 'ignorethis')
[08:49:05] <xec> work*
[08:49:16] <Flo0815> xec: so $('li:not(#ignorethis)') ?
[08:49:23] <xec> Flo0815: right
[08:49:27] <Flo0815> phil-adept: i know but i think this is not nice :)
[08:49:30] <phil-adept> meekohi: personal preference really... I tend to use $(document).ready
[08:49:31] <Flo0815> xec: thx
[08:49:32] <xec> phil-adept: this.id is sufficient to find the ID
[08:49:52] <meekohi> phil-adept: Personal preference as in they are the exact same, just syntax preference?
[08:50:10] <phil-adept> xec? I said $(this).attr('id')...
[08:50:27] <phil-adept> within an .each() will return the ID of the current element in the iteration
[08:50:34] <xec> phil-adept: i know you did - but you don't need to - easier and quicker to just do this.id
[08:50:42] <phil-adept> meekohi, pretty much
[08:50:47] <phil-adept> xec, getcha
[08:51:36] <phil-adept> Flo0815: Nice, didn't know you can use :not()... that's a nice feature :)
[08:52:32] <nibblebot> can i attach multiple handlers with a single $.on call?
[08:52:52] <Flo0815> phil-adept: i knew that it exist but i never get the right syntax :)
[08:53:27] <phil-adept> meekohi: http://4loc.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/documentready-vs-windowload/
[08:54:03] <phil-adept> $.ready, $(document).ready are identical I think. window.load() is different
[08:54:38] <phil-adept> nibblebot: more info?
[08:54:40] <Joeytje50> isn't $(function() {}) the same as $.ready(function() {}) and $(document).ready(function() {})?
[08:54:59] <Joeytje50> so like, without the .ready it would do the same?
[08:55:13] <nibblebot> phil-adept: instead of $(el).on('click', fn); $(el).on('click', fn2); I was thinking like $(el).on('click', fn, fn2);
[08:55:23] <phil-adept> Joeytje50, pretty much, window.load() occurs at a different time though
[08:56:01] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: is $(fn) the same as window.load or the same as document.ready?
[08:56:02] <phil-adept> nibblebot: can't you put the different calls within the one function?
[08:56:39] <phil-adept> Joeytje50 all 3 are different I believe
[08:56:43] <doup> (phil-adept: i just noticed i was asking symfony issues in jquery channel, l0l)
[08:56:45] <Joeytje50> oh
[08:57:08] <Joeytje50> nibblebot: you could do $(el).on('click', function() {fn;fn2;})
[08:57:13] <nibblebot> yeah..
[08:57:17] <nibblebot> that works
[08:57:21] <phil-adept> window.load and doc.ready are completely different.
[08:57:31] <brian-c> Is there a way to delegate events on a direct descendant using $().on? I want do do something like $('ul').on('click', '> li', doSomething)
[08:58:28] <Joeytje50> yes brian-c: $('ul').on('click',function() {$(this).find('li').css('color','red')})
[08:58:30] <Joeytje50> for example
[08:58:57] <Joeytje50> or $(this).children('li') for direct children
[08:59:46] <Joeytje50> brian-c: is that what you were looking for?
[08:59:50] <brian-c> I want the function to fire after a direct-descendant LI has been clicked.
[09:00:09] <Joeytje50> oh, then $('ul > li').on('click',fn)
[09:00:43] <Joeytje50> that should work for what you want brian-c
[09:02:36] <Joeytje50> does anyone know if I can do something to make JQuery "press enter"?
[09:02:42] <Joeytje50> so not submit or anything
[09:03:01] <Joeytje50> but press enter in an input/textarea/anything and do whatever it would do normally then
[09:03:23] <quicksilver> as far as I know, there is no cross-browser way to inject events.
[09:03:46] <Joeytje50> doesn't JQuery have one?
[09:03:48] <ajpiano> brian-c: you can't use an unscoped child selector with .on() like that anymore
[09:04:03] <ajpiano> Joeytje50: no. real event simulation is a separate ball of wax
[09:04:29] <Joeytje50> bah
[09:04:57] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: What are you trying to achieve? What would enter normally do other than submit?
[09:06:45] <cpaq> I am trying to use the validator plugin http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/, I have two inputs for validation, the validation is working for both inputs except the validtor is returning false only when the first input is invalid, if the first input is valid and second is invalid, the it is returning true
[09:07:07] <ajpiano> Joeytje50: https://github.com/eduardolundgren/jquery-simulate
[09:07:27] <phil-adept> cpaq: code?
[09:07:48] <ajpiano> Joeytje50: slightl more recent version: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.simulate.js  that's what is used in jquery ui to simulate real browser events
[09:07:53] <cpaq> phil-adept, I already showed you
[09:08:12] <ajpiano> it uses the document.createEvent etc, cylce where it exists, so on and so forth
[09:08:29] <cpaq> phil-adept, did you ever use validator plugin?
[09:08:40] <phil-adept> is this it?  http://jsfiddle.net/8HezB/3
[09:09:33] <Joeytje50> oh phil-adept: what enter would do is run a script, on a weird way I don't really understand, and it would be easier to just make a script "press enter" than to figure that out, imo
[09:10:02] <cpaq> phil-adept, yeah, you just skipped the validator in that edit, but thanks anyways.  I figured out how to test for validator success: $('#myform').valid(), thing is it is only working on the first input, not more than one
[09:10:21] <phil-adept> which validator lugin are you using?
[09:10:30] <VioByte> http://jsfiddle.net/tPLuk/ can anyone help me to get this working? just a cloning process + drag and drop for each clone
[09:10:36] <cpaq> phil-adept, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[09:10:59] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: that's what I'm trying to work out, what the function of the button is for? seems wierd! lol
[09:11:42] <VioByte> http://jsfiddle.net/tPLuk/1/ updated.
[09:12:28] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: it's some function with a named array ( {this:'that'} ) and one of the values is what to do when a key event occurs
[09:12:30] <Joeytje50> or something
[09:12:48] <Joeytje50> and it is not with an <input>, but a <textarea>
[09:13:30] <Dark_Wolf> Hey, I have another question for you guys: is there a reason that $('element').html("Foo"); throws "Object has no method 'html'" in just Chrome?
[09:13:31] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: idk if you can see this, but it's http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/49613/group/minify%3D0/chat_js
[09:13:53] <Joeytje50> it's the part where it has 	if (event.which == 13 && !event.shiftKey) {
[09:14:01] <Joeytje50> the sendMessage
[09:14:12] <Joeytje50> I don't know how to make that thing run
[09:14:28] <Rozy> Rozy
[09:14:41] <Joeytje50> so I thought maybe it's possible to just make the script "press enter" to make it easier
[09:14:43] <jpic> hi all, how to make sortable items to be put back in their initial place if they are not dropped in a connected element ?
[09:15:47] <jpic> for example, if i make $('fieldset').sortable({connectWith: 'fieldset', items: '.form-row',}) this will let me "drag" a form-row and drop it **outside** a fieldset, making the form-row lost in space
[09:18:11] <Jon47> does anybody know why triggering a "click" event on an a tag with an href and target and stuff does not actually open the new link?  Is that a "bug" or can it always be expected to behave this way?
[09:18:38] <xec> Jon47: that's the way it works
[09:18:50] <Jon47> right i understand that
[09:18:53] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: You want to run sendMessage?
[09:18:59] <Jon47> but is it intended to work that way, or is it considered a bug?
[09:19:06] <xec> intended
[09:19:11] <Joeytje50> yeah, I think so
[09:19:12] <xec> afaik
[09:19:20] <Jon47> because "trigger" says it will execute all the attached handlers and behaviors for the matched element
[09:19:32] <Joeytje50> but then there would be the problem that it starts with a check if the event is an enter key without shift key
[09:19:34] <xec> Jon47: yes, but there are no handlers attached
[09:19:49] <Joeytje50> but if I just run the script, I don't have an event attached, so that doesn't work either
[09:19:50] <Jon47> but isn't changing the location a native behavior of the link?
[09:20:05] <phil-adept> jon47 is the function returning false / event.preventDefault() being used?
[09:20:19] <Jon47> phil-adept no
[09:20:24] <xec> Jon47: i guess you could call it behaviour but i don't think that's what is meant by behaviors
[09:20:30] <Jon47> xec ok thanks
[09:20:37] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: I can't see what you're trying to achive. are you trying to call that function programatically ?
[09:20:51] <jpic> aww my bad
[09:20:53] <Jon47> phil-adept this is a known result of the trigger function, i'm just trying to figure out if i can rely on it to work this way
[09:21:08] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: I want to make it do the things it does when you press enter
[09:21:38] <phil-adept> which is "sendMessage" yeah?
[09:21:48] <Joeytje50> so I want to run sendMessage but that the if (event.which == 13 doesn't stop it from running the rest
[09:22:17] <Joeytje50> because if you'd just run the sendMessage, it would not have event.which == 13
[09:22:23] <Joeytje50> because there is no event then
[09:22:24] <phil-adept> what is event.which, I thought it was event.keyCode?
[09:22:48] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: I think event.which is more cross-browser
[09:22:53] <Joeytje50> iirc FF doesn't have .keyCode
[09:23:21] <VioByte> http://jsfiddle.net/tPLuk/2/ updated.  "Your JS code is valid." Sigh.
[09:23:23] <Flo0815> hey another question: if i have like $('button').click(function(){...}); in an external js-file, it doesn't work. I write ..live(...) instead. Is this the "right" soluteion?
[09:23:30] <Joeytje50> anyway, it works exactly like .keyCode, phil-adept
[09:23:59] <phil-adept> right, so it's not calling submitMessage on keyDown (when it's enter)?
[09:24:56] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: is this js file an example of something working or what you're actually working on
[09:25:04] <phil-adept> http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/49613/group/minify%3D0/chat_js
[09:25:13] <phil-adept> or did you send it me as an example of what you want to achieve?
[09:25:17] <Joeytje50> it's what I'm actually trying to modify
[09:25:23] <Joeytje50> I can't edit that script
[09:25:34] <Joeytje50> but I can edit another script that runs after that script I linked has loaded
[09:25:34] <Jon47> Flo0815: you want to use .on, but be aware of WHY it works when .click doesn't (javascript can only act on existing DOM elements, so if the javascript runs before the element exists, it won't be there to get handlers attached to it)
[09:25:44] <Joeytje50> so first that script loads
[09:25:53] <Joeytje50> then another script I do have access to runs
[09:26:18] <RoosterJuice> is there a way to simulate a "click" on an element?
[09:26:21] <Flo0815> Jon47: so $('#element').on.click(... ?
[09:26:32] <phil-adept> so you can't modify the 1st script, but need to?
[09:26:32] <Flo0815> RoosterJuice: trigger('click')
[09:26:48] <Jon47> Flo0815: read the docs, but it'll be something like .on('click', function...
[09:26:48] <xec> Flo0815: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:26:54] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: Sorry I'm really confused lol
[09:27:00] <Flo0815> Jon47 thx
[09:27:06] <Flo0815> xec: thx
[09:27:38] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: I can't modify the first script, but I can run another script after that to make changes to the first script
[09:28:05] <Joeytje50> but I tried doing NodeRoomController.sendMessage = function() {}
[09:28:08] <Joeytje50> but that doesn't work either
[09:28:17] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: ok, but are you trying to spook a keypress or detect if enter has been pressed?
[09:28:21] <phil-adept> spoof*
[09:28:25] <VioByte> still requesting help with http://jsfiddle.net/tPLuk/3/ thanks
[09:28:25] <RoosterJuice> Flo0815, sweet!
[09:28:26] <RoosterJuice> thanx
[09:28:27] <Joeytje50> first
[09:28:41] <Joeytje50> I want it to do something that makes the thing run
[09:28:49] <Joeytje50> without the user having to press enter
[09:29:03] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: right, because it doesn't work at the moment or because you're adding more functionality?
[09:29:09] <RoosterJuice> is there a way to reference the NEXT element matching your reference?
[09:29:13] <RoosterJuice> rather than all of them?
[09:29:16] <Joeytje50> I'm trying to add more functionality
[09:29:29] <phil-adept> so you want the message to auto-send ?
[09:29:32] <Joeytje50> kinda like an IRC script, I want to make something like an autoreply script
[09:29:33] <Joeytje50> yeah
[09:29:53] <phil-adept> right, and what's the trigger to call this new feature?
[09:30:01] <Dark_Wolf> Fixed it! Apparently status is a global on webkit, who knew? :/
[09:30:04] <phil-adept> a timeout, or on recieving a message?
[09:30:28] <Joeytje50> on receiving a message, phil-adept
[09:30:38] <dschuett> anyone mind taking a look at my custom form validation? It knows that a form field value starts with "e.i." but it doesn't realize that the field is not blank: http://jsfiddle.net/DCLEA/2/
[09:30:44] <Joeytje50> but I already have something to run a function when I receive a new message
[09:30:53] <Joeytje50> just not to send a message back
[09:31:56] <phil-adept> personally I'd extend the class and add a new function like respondToMessage() and dupe the sending mechanism in ther
[09:32:05] <Joeytje50> how?
[09:32:09] <phil-adept> minus the checks for the enter key being pressed
[09:32:33] <Flo0815> Jon47: ".on() is not a function!) ...?
[09:32:55] <Flo0815> *researchin*
[09:33:10] <Jon47> Flo0815: as it says in the docs, it was introduced in jquery 1.7â¦ if you've got a bug then make a fiddle and we'll try to help ya
[09:33:41] <Flo0815> Jon47: i'll use live instead
[09:33:43] <Flo0815> so nvm
[09:33:53] <Flo0815> thx anyway
[09:33:56] <Jon47> or you could update to the latest version!  much faster event handling
[09:34:22] <Flo0815> Jon47: the problem is that i have a plugin that needs jQuery 1.3
[09:34:24] <Flo0815> ...
[09:34:41] <Jon47> understood, good luck then
[09:34:44] <Flo0815> thx
[09:34:45] <Jon47> wow, 1.3 is super old
[09:34:50] <Flo0815> i know -.-
[09:35:00] <Jon47> you should free yourself from that dependency
[09:35:08] <Flo0815> but its the only plugin for queueing animations, that fits my concerns
[09:35:49] <Flo0815> i tried alot
[09:35:59] <phil-adept> Joeytje50: I'm not too sure. I think NodeRoomController is the class you need to extend. You can overwrite logic in a class you see by redefining the fuinctions / var's within
[09:36:25] <VioByte> If anyone is actually looking over my code, please let me know, so i don't feel ignored.
[09:36:37] <Joeytje50> phil-adept: so I should copy the entire code from NodeRoomController to that file I can edit
[09:36:49] <Joeytje50> and then add a part where I can send messages myself?
[09:36:58] <phil-adept> probably just create a new function than overwrite and use the new function for what you need :)
[09:37:57] <RoosterJuice> what is the best way to see what variables are while you are running your script?  dialog boxes? or is there a way to see them from google chrome console, in a log or something?
[09:38:27] <phil-adept> RoosterJuice: console.log()
[09:38:36] <phil-adept> RoosterJuice: http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/javascript-debugging-beginners
[09:38:50] <quicksilver> RoosterJuice: chrome has watch expressions
[09:39:11] <quicksilver> so do safarai developer tools and firebug
[09:40:20] <phil-adept> RoosterJuice: ps if you create breakpoints in your code you can see what var & object values are at the point of break :)
[09:43:28] <VioByte> i give up.
[09:45:01] <stradade> phil-adept are u here ?=
[09:45:56] <stradade> phil-adept http://pastebin.com/QNE5mbdp
[09:46:35] <VioByte> last attempt for help on this issue that's time sensitive http://jsfiddle.net/tPLuk/4/ just a simple json + cloning with drag and drop ability
[09:46:49] <phil-adept> VioByte: looking at it now
[09:46:51] <Flo0815> VioByte gimme a sec
[09:47:00] <VioByte> thanks.
[09:47:06] <VioByte> its just driving me nuts
[09:47:35] <Flo0815> VioByte: whats the prob?
[09:47:42] <phil-adept> VioByte: right, explain this to me, what are you wanting to accomplish, what are you results and how do they differ?
[09:48:31] <stradade> someone can help me i cant acces value of form element by my js http://pastebin.com/QNE5mbdp
[09:48:38] <VioByte> well, json is used to create a clone of "userslip" so it will build a list with .insertAfter
[09:49:03] <VioByte> as for the drag an drop i could only get it to notice one of the drops but it ignores the rest
[09:49:06] <Flo0815> stradade: what the prob
[09:49:11] <VioByte> then stops functioning properly
[09:49:36] <VioByte> what i have on jsfiddle is a snipping of a bigger project
[09:49:48] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, me again. Just been playing with jsfiddle, it's very clever! I have this http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/8/ and I'm trying to get the replace the space with a _. I've done some research and apparently it's faster this way? Anyway I'm trying to swap a space with a _ but can't seem to figure out how to do it, can anyone assist?
[09:49:48] <VioByte> the data is just there to test it
[09:50:12] <phil-adept> VioByte: on my page I only have an image of a bin, nothing else, and I can't drag it?
[09:50:21] <VioByte> yea i know
[09:50:38] <VioByte> the bin is the trashcan (droppable)
[09:50:53] <VioByte> the userslip witch is not being cloned for some reason would be above it
[09:51:06] <phil-adept> ok 2 secs
[09:51:15] <VioByte> that can be dragged to the can (delete it)
[09:51:54] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-: http://w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp
[09:52:52] <VioByte> phil-adept: it should clone the userslip (original one) at least 3 times but the original stays hidden
[09:53:48] <Raydiation> is there some way to store information on a <li>? like an id
[09:54:04] <Raydiation> without using the html id attribute
[09:54:22] <Zzaichik> data
[09:54:54] <Raydiation> ty
[09:54:57] <Zzaichik> If you're using HTML5, you can create whatever attribute you'd like..
[09:55:36] <phil-adept> VioByte: no worries, looking into it now
[09:55:50] <fRAiLtY-> phil-adept: Cheers, sussed that bit now, got the space replaced with a _ but oddly my drop-down has just disappered on addition of the document.write line lol?
[09:55:53] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/9/
[09:57:11] <rabbi1> does sparklines have individual colors for each bar ?
[09:59:34] <Zzaichik> isn't document.write a no no
[10:00:43] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: never use document.write
[10:00:49] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: under no circumstances, ever
[10:00:51] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: It's OK, sussed it now
[10:01:12] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: better: http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/10/ ?
[10:01:17] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: so you know why the dropdown disappeard?
[10:01:32] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: yeah, much better
[10:01:34] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: No, not as such, why did it disappear?
[10:01:49] <fRAiLtY-> Was I overwriting with the document.write?
[10:01:52] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: document.write was originally intended to be a part of initial page render
[10:02:09] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: if you run document.write after a page is loaded, it'll overwrite the whole page
[10:02:27] <fRAiLtY-> Guessed it might be something like that
[10:02:55] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: i was a little extreme with my recommendation--technically there are a few times when document.write gets used
[10:03:04] <fRAiLtY-> lol :P
[10:03:07] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: the google analytics script uses it, actually
[10:03:17] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: but that is of course only during pageload
[10:03:31] <khmer> and only because GA doesn't trust the // trick to detect protocol
[10:05:08] <rabbi1> does sparklines have individual colors for each bar ?
[10:05:47] <nick_omega> have this jquery component, harvest chosen, but it is not taking effect.  http://pastebin.com/Vby7BE6r  why is this?
[10:06:24] <JackBauer24> rabbi1: I would suggest to look at the docs
[10:06:52] <mdunham918_> say I have a var input = $('<input />'); and then i do var content = []; content.push(input.attr('id', 'input1')); $('div').html($(content.join('')); why do i get [object Object] instead of the html for the input?
[10:06:52] <phil-adept> VioByte: You there?
[10:06:54] <rabbi1> JackBauer24: It talks just about barColor, which is similar for all bars :(
[10:06:59] <VioByte> phil-adept: yea
[10:07:32] <Famic> hi
[10:07:35] <mdunham918_> i understand that $('<input />') itself is an object but how do i get it to translate into html?
[10:07:59] <JackBauer24> rabbi1: extend it then or use another plugin
[10:08:07] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/11/ I'm trying to adapt a solution that phil-adept gave me earlier and not having a lot of success. I'm trying to get the text value of the drop down, that's fine, and remove spaces and replace with -, that's fine, then show the relevant table based on it's ID, not fine :x
[10:09:06] <Famic> I have a select that hides all results from a list except those with class X. Now I want another select of the same kind, and have both work well together. It appears it's a bit tricky. Any idea how to handle that ?
[10:09:12] <rabbi1> JackBauer24: thinking of extending it. but not much of time left now. will go with jqPlot, any other suggestions ?
[10:09:38] <rabbi1> JackBauer24: HighChart is the one i liked, but not with Free license
[10:09:49] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: what is this "text()" function you're executing
[10:09:56] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: that function isn't defined!
[10:10:53] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: I have to say it was there in the example I was fiddling with before which just echo'd into a div text(str) and it echo'd text
[10:10:59] <fRAiLtY-> echo lol, you know what I mean
[10:11:01] <fRAiLtY-> too much PHP
[10:11:12] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: it may have been defined on that page, but it isn't defined on this
[10:11:20] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: you should use a javascript console while you're working
[10:11:27] <fRAiLtY-> I'm using jsfiddle
[10:11:36] <khmer> not enough, jsfiddle doesn't show you the errors
[10:11:45] <khmer> you have to combine jsfiddle with your own dev tools
[10:11:50] <khmer> specifically, a console
[10:11:56] <khmer> in firefox, that's firebug's console tab
[10:12:12] <khmer> in chrome and other webkits, that's (Ctrl||Cmd)-Shift-I
[10:12:19] <fRAiLtY-> Got the one open in Chrome now
[10:12:23] <khmer> great
[10:12:24] <fRAiLtY-> see the error
[10:12:31] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm
[10:12:35] <khmer> so now you know what the problem is
[10:12:48] <khmer> do you know what running the "text" function on that variable in is supposed to return?
[10:13:02] <fRAiLtY-> str works as that echo's the value of the drop down with a - instead of space, so I know that bit works
[10:13:20] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to set that string as a variable showMatrix
[10:13:23] <khmer> but the question is what are you trying to accomplish
[10:13:30] <fRAiLtY-> so showMatrix = 300gsm-Gloss
[10:13:37] <khmer> doesn't str already equal that
[10:13:38] <fRAiLtY-> then show that table only as that's the matching ID
[10:13:43] <fRAiLtY-> yes
[10:13:58] <khmer> then why do you need another variable
[10:14:10] <fRAiLtY-> I could just use str in the bottom part really couldn't I
[10:14:33] <khmer> just remember to ask yrself what every line of code is supposed to be accomplishing!
[10:14:55] <Raydiation> why do i get Channel is not defined at line 37  http://pastebin.com/1Hpkk8EA
[10:15:08] <fRAiLtY-> Ahaa, khmer http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/13/ it works!!!!1
[10:17:25] <Flo0815> hey can someone tell me how to work with $.getScript?
[10:17:34] <Flo0815> just load a script and use the functions insed?
[10:17:44] <RoosterJuice> how would i be able to print out the name of the next element to the console log?
[10:17:51] <RoosterJuice> console.log( (this).next() );   ??
[10:18:11] <Flo0815> RoosterJuice next.name()?
[10:18:43] <RoosterJuice> next is not a method?
[10:19:31] <Zzaichik> .next();   http://api.jquery.com/next/
[10:20:27] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: so does this http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/14/ :)
[10:20:56] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: show off
[10:20:59] <fRAiLtY-> what had I done wrong?
[10:21:04] <nick_omega> have this jquery component, harvest chosen, but it is not taking effect.  http://pastebin.com/Vby7BE6r  why is this?
[10:21:11] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: there was just some unnecessary stuff in there, that's all
[10:21:17] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: the .each was the big thing
[10:21:33] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: there's no need to iterate through a collection that you know will only contain one item--the selected one
[10:21:50] <dangerousdave> I have this function that successfully populates a textarea with text from a select, when the select is changed. https://gist.github.com/12b501722e4d24fc8afd Problem is if I change the select, delete the contents of the textarea, and change the select again, it no longer populates the textarea. Any idea why please?
[10:21:59] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, cool. Was going to ask if there was a better way of doing it
[10:22:18] <RoosterJuice> thanx
[10:22:41] <Hawkee> suppose I load content via .load, shouldn't I be able to call functions defined in my original header?
[10:22:48] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: in general i recommend putting value attributes on your options
[10:22:50] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik,  I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'next'
[10:23:14] <Zzaichik> how are you calling it?
[10:23:17] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: I agree, however I'm working with magento and the options are populated by javascript, hence no actual drop-down to manipulate
[10:23:24] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, console.log( (this).next().name() );
[10:23:27] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: oh god magento
[10:23:42] <khmer> fRAiLtY-: can't you change the .phtml file
[10:23:45] <Zzaichik> do console.log(this); and see what it returns.
[10:23:53] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice: $(this).next()
[10:24:29] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, it's returning the current div
[10:24:32] <Zzaichik> ah, nice catch. wasn't paying attentionâ¦
[10:24:59] <Zzaichik> console.log($(this).next().name() );
[10:25:26] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, how come you need the $?  Because it's looking for something?
[10:25:44] <ajpiano> because .next() is a jquery method, not a method of a native dom element
[10:26:05] <Zzaichik> the dollar sign is a shortcut for jQuery. So yeah, ajpiano just explained it.
[10:26:34] <RoosterJuice> so now I'm getting: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'name'
[10:26:42] <dabear> but isn't jquery dom!?
[10:26:49] <jedimind_> .attr('name');
[10:27:00] <dabear> jquery is bad if it can't handle .name!
[10:27:07] <dabear> why doesn't it?
[10:27:24] <dabear> </troll>
[10:27:31] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice: you have to learn the difference between a jQuery object and regular dom element
[10:28:01] <RoosterJuice> ajpiano, yes I remember now
[10:28:03] <ajpiano> you can read native DOM properties off the jQuery object, and you can't call jQuery methods on the native DOM element
[10:28:04] <RoosterJuice> just looked it up
[10:28:13] <Zzaichik> ^^'
[10:28:16] <Zzaichik> good man
[10:29:17] <khmer> $(this).getElementsByTagNameNS('derp')
[10:29:30] <Zzaichik> derpa derpa street
[10:32:17] <RoosterJuice> ugh, here's what I'm trying to do, maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong in my logic:
[10:32:50] <Zzaichik> yay for jsfiddle time!
[10:35:16] <khmer> please don't paste 300 lines to channel please don't paste 300 lines to channel please don't paste 300 lines to channel
[10:35:25] <RoosterJuice> I have a list of jeditable fields, when I exit the edit field, it calls an event that tells the cursor to go to the next field with the "click" trigger
[10:35:36] <RoosterJuice> so all i want to know
[10:36:06] <RoosterJuice> is how to trigger a click event on the next div element that contains the class ".myclass"
[10:36:42] <RoosterJuice> would i use nextUntil(".myclass")?
[10:36:45] <kamo> Cross domain .get()
[10:36:55] <kamo> Any ideas
[10:37:00] <khmer> given one DOM element, you want the next element in document order that matches a particular selector?
[10:37:14] <RoosterJuice> yes
[10:37:25] <triptec> is there anyone else that experienced problems with a <input type=image> and using .click, event.preventDefault() doesn't stop the submit for me?
[10:37:31] <kamo> Would love to hear how
[10:37:47] <ajpiano> ?sop workaround @ kamo
[10:37:47] <bot-t> kamo, workarounds for the same-origin policy: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/capturing-live-html-page-to-a-jquery-object#14737000000617405
[10:40:27] <khmer> RoosterJuice: there are recursive methods to look for such things, but i think the efficient thing is to determine this at document load time
[10:40:43] <khmer> RoosterJuice: build a linked list!
[10:40:45] <ajpiano> the easiest is just do do index based search
[10:40:48] <kamo> ok will try them
[10:40:50] <kamo> thanks
[10:40:54] <khmer> ajpiano's right
[10:41:20] <NoiseEee> triptec: don't observe the click event of buttons on a form, observe the submit event of the form itself
[10:41:35] <ajpiano> var allMyThings = $(".foo");  allMyThings.click(function() {  var nextThing = allMyThings.eq( allMyThings.index(this) + 1 );  });
[10:42:00] <triptec> noise, yeah and set a bg on the submit button instead?
[10:42:31] <NoiseEee> triptec: thats irrelevant, use your image if you like, but don't look for a 'click' event on it, look for the submit event of the form
[10:42:32] <Zzaichik> You should use a background image, and get away from type="image". Or at least that's what I'd do.
[10:42:41] <RoosterJuice> thanx for the help guys!
[10:43:20] <triptec> Noise, thing is I need name and value and that doesn't get posted if u use type=image but it does if type=submit
[10:43:51] <triptec> very annoying as type=image acts like a submit..
[10:44:40] <RoosterJuice> ajpiano, so say that (this) is a div element.  It is contained within a <td> element.  The next div is also contained within a <td> element.  Would next refer to the <td> or the next div?
[10:45:25] <ajpiano> it would refer to the next div
[10:45:48] <khmer> RoosterJuice: http://jsfiddle.net/rHXxV/
[10:45:52] <khmer> there's an example
[10:45:54] <ajpiano> the technique i just showed above just says "give me all the things that match this selector in order" then "find my position in that list, and then go to the next one after it"
[10:46:11] <khmer> RoosterJuice: my above example caches the "next editor"
[10:46:21] <khmer> building a linked list
[10:46:43] <khmer> ajpiano: i'll fight you
[10:47:15] <RoosterJuice> ah
[10:47:20] <RoosterJuice> i see
[10:47:24] <khmer> RoosterJuice: ajpiano's technique is slightly better, as it'll hold up to runtime changes in the collection
[10:47:26] <ajpiano> khmer: haha
[10:47:38] <ajpiano> khmer: well, it may or may not. it depends when you cache the collection :)
[10:47:46] <ajpiano> but can work in *either* situation which is nice
[10:51:08] <nick_omega> I have this jquery component, harvest chosen, but it is not taking effect.  http://pastebin.com/Vby7BE6r  why is this?
[10:51:39] <RoosterJuice> khmer, so in your example 'nexteditor' is the name of the data collection?
[10:52:12] <blindMoe> nick_omega: jsfiddle.net is your friend... and ours
[10:52:55] <RoosterJuice> this is awesome guys, thanx a bunch
[10:53:01] <RoosterJuice> i really appreciate it
[10:53:36] <khmer> RoosterJuice: it's just an arbitrary string key i used to store and retrieve the reference, yes
[10:55:07] <khmer> nick_omega: you're probably loading your scripts out of order
[11:01:19] <dmsuperman> If I want to find all the form elements in a form, in order to obtain and possibly change the name, what's the best way to go about that?
[11:01:26] <dmsuperman> Just select input, textarea, select ?
[11:01:33] <dmsuperman> "input, textarea, select"
[11:01:56] <dmsuperman> I was thinking maybe .serializeArray but I'm not sure how performant it is, plus then I would still have to reselect all the elements
[11:02:00] <dabear> dmsuperman: #form :input
[11:02:07] <dmsuperman> ah perfect
[11:02:13] <dmsuperman> lovely, thanks
[11:04:14] <unseensoul> Hi
[11:06:47] <loocorez> Hi, I'm having trouble with a jquery animation. An example is here: http://jsfiddle.net/fZZMK/. Type @ in the first textbox to see, the problem is at the end of the animation it gets to maybe 10-20 px width and then it switches to display:none. how can I fix this?
[11:07:45] <blindMoe> loocorez: it is probably still showing the padding / margins / border which is why it looks 10 - 20 px wide
[11:07:56] <blindMoe> since you are only affecting the width attribute
[11:08:14] <loocorez> Ohhh
[11:08:19] <loocorez> Forgot about that, thanks!
[11:14:03] <nick_omega> khmer, building the DOM and then running the js at the end.
[11:14:53] <coj> crossposting: anyone know how to get scrollWidth of an element using jquery/js? jquery.width() isn't cutting it
[11:16:21] <loocorez> blindMoe: I updated it to affect padding/margins/border and it still has a slight delay... http://jsfiddle.net/fZZMK/3/
[11:17:29] <huglester> hello everyone:) guys, I have ie 5 profile photos out of 20... which I would like to rotate photos in random order.. what way would it be best to do so?
[11:17:41] <huglester> maybe there are already some libs optimized for this?
[11:19:18] <blindMoe> loocorez: just do a .toggle() on it completely.. you are still missing a css rule in there somewhere
[11:20:28] <blindMoe> loocorez: http://jsfiddle.net/fZZMK/5/
[11:20:32] <blindMoe> hows that?
[11:24:01] <khmer> nick_omega: any console errors?
[11:24:18] <unseensoul> Is there a way to clone/duplicate an element so you can duplicate it as many times you want regardless of whether the original element changes? var f = $('.upload_field').clone(); does not work as I would expect. It seems the variable f is somehow automatically updated everytime I use, if I am not mistaken.
[11:24:56] <khmer> unseensoul: nope, the cloned element should be detached and independent from the dom
[11:25:37] <unseensoul> khmer, it is not working like that in here :S Let me show you something.
[11:26:27] <nick_omega> khmer, are you implying the code works on your machine
[11:26:47] <khmer> nick_omega: nope! i'm just asking if you have any console errors
[11:27:42] <unseensoul> khmer, http://pastebin.com/rp70qYEB that will not work as expected.
[11:27:52] <unseensoul> Perhaps, I am doing something wrong.
[11:28:04] <nick_omega> khmer, $(".chzn-select").chosen is not a function
[11:28:52] <khmer> nick_omega: where is your plugin that adds $.fn.chosen?
[11:29:07] <khmer> unseensoul: can you use jsfiddle for that?
[11:29:15] <khmer> unseensoul: i think you'll like it
[11:29:32] <unseensoul> Ok
[11:34:51] <unseensoul> khmer, http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/ it does not work at all in here lol
[11:35:20] <jklmnop> does anyone have any non-js solutions to matching the last item in a collection returned from a css selector?
[11:35:33] <khmer> jklmnop: ask in #css!
[11:35:39] <khmer> jklmnop: but you might be looking for last-child
[11:36:07] <khmer> unseensoul: you shouldn't bind things with literal onclick attributes
[11:36:10] <Zzaichik> hey js room, I have a non-js question
[11:36:17] <khmer> ?on @unseensoul
[11:36:17] <bot-t> unseensoul, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:36:39] <Zzaichik> How do I grow to like PHP?
[11:36:47] <khmer> Zzaichik: you don't
[11:36:55] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys, is there any benefit to doing closures as: (function($){ â¦ })() over, jQuery(function($){ â¦ });
[11:36:56] <_pr0t0type_> ?
[11:37:26] <khmer> _pr0t0type_: when you run jQuery() on a function, you are putting that function in a domready handler
[11:37:39] <khmer> _pr0t0type_: which is different from just wrapping your script in an immediately-invoked function
[11:37:44] <khmer> they're two different things
[11:38:45] <NickerS> hello i need a help with my photo gallery can some one help me
[11:38:50] <unseensoul> khmer, http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/1/ it is still not working as expected when the button is clicked.
[11:40:11] <blindMoe> loocorez: did you try my suggestion?
[11:40:38] <khmer> unseensoul: seems fine to me
[11:40:49] <nail_> unseensoul: more like http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/2/ ?
[11:40:51] <khmer> unseensoul: it appends another input, different from the first one
[11:41:01] <nail_> not sure what's actually expected
[11:42:13] <khmer> oh, i see
[11:42:16] <khmer> nail_'s got it right
[11:42:37] <khmer> your problem is that you're appending your clone to every member of the .upload_field collection, which keeps expanding
[11:42:44] <khmer> forkbomb!
[11:43:00] <brianV> Is anyone aware of a touch-enabled slideshow app that also allows you to permalink specific images?
[11:43:16] <brianV> client has some very specific requirements ;(
[11:45:11] <nail_> or yes, http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/3/ if you want to clone the input as it was on load
[11:45:32] <hlve> Say I want to make a <div class="stretchme"> OMG ITS LIKE GUMBY </div> width be the width of the browser window using jQuery.... how would I use width()?
[11:45:32] <Danielpk> i need to fadeIn all children's of element.. i trying $(el).children().fadeIn();
[11:46:14] <Danielpk> but don't work.. any tip?
[11:46:55] <hlve> i mean, it'd be the same as width:100% but the only problem with that is that the body has a width set.
[11:46:56] <hlve> o.o
[11:47:14] <nail_> hlve: $('.strechme').width($(window).width())
[11:47:22] <Addicted> ^ exactly that
[11:47:28] <hlve> You are amazing.
[11:47:30] <hlve> thanks :)
[11:47:52] <nail_> that won't survive a resize though :)
[11:50:05] <khmer> so then you need $(window).on('resize'
[11:51:51] <josefig> how can I access html var from outside the $.getJSON function ? http://pastebin.com/QQuRd92q
[11:52:12] <josefig> I tried declare it from outside but no luck.
[11:52:18] <unseensoul> nail_, khmer that was my point duplicating the number of .upload_field elements, not one by one. Still I do not get why it does not work :S
[11:52:34] <khmer> josefig: you need to read up on asynchronous programming

[11:52:59] <bot-t> josefig, #8850 (resize events crashes on firefox 4)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 11 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8850
[11:53:03] <phil-adept> Anyone have issues with jquery ui draggable / droppable?
[11:53:10] <khmer> ooh boy, that's not what i wanted--sorry josefig
[11:53:14] <josefig> uh?
[11:53:16] <josefig> :P
[11:53:57] <khmer> josefig: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40
[11:54:06] <phil-adept> problem we're having is inconsitency. Does anyone know how jquery ui manages the hit and drag areas?
[11:54:08] <josefig> ok
[11:54:20] <phil-adept> It seems to only work if the center of the draggable is over the droppable... anyone confirm this?
[11:55:23] <khmer> unseensoul: every time you click the button, you're running $('.upload_field') again, which then picks up the clone you appended, since it also has that class
[11:55:36] <khmer> unseensoul: and the .after method appends to *every member* of a collection
[11:55:38] <NoiseEee> phil-adept: check out the 'tolerance' option
[11:56:12] <NoiseEee> phil-adept: set it to 'pointer'
[12:01:22] <unseensoul> khmer, if you go back to http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/1/ you will notice that the results produced by each click are not consistent. For instance, the second time you click the button nothing will happen. At the fourth click two new elements are added instead of four...
[12:01:29] <phil-adept> cheers NoiseEee
[12:02:33] <nail_> unseensoul: that's because .after() will clone the content to insert it after the elements if there are more than one
[12:03:20] <phil-adept> NoiseEee: I can't see options for tolerance?
[12:03:47] <khmer> nail_: no, he's got a point. on the *second* click, you might expect that two elements multiply to 4, but nothing happens
[12:03:50] <unseensoul> nail_ ?
[12:03:59] <phil-adept> NoiseEee: Ignore I Was looking at draggable not droppable
[12:06:00] <phil-adept> NoiseEee: Cheers fella, spot on!
[12:06:11] <blindMoe> unseensoul: if you figure that out will you let us know?  That is an interesting one
[12:06:15] <nail_> khmer: there is some black magic on the 2nd call, the 2nd input gets actually replaced by a fresh one (you can see that if you click a first time, choose a file in the 2nd input and click again
[12:06:43] <khmer> nail_: i wonder why it's happening like that!
[12:06:51] <unseensoul> blindMoe, if I do I will lol
[12:07:14] <blindMoe> unseensoul: http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/8/
[12:07:36] <blindMoe> is that what you were looking for?
[12:08:03] <blindMoe> make sure you change name="photo" to name="photo[]"
[12:08:15] <blindMoe> and treat your $_FILES entry as an array
[12:08:16] <NoiseEee> phil-adept: you're welcome
[12:08:16] <unseensoul> blindMoe, no. I want to duplicate the number of elements with a class upload_field
[12:08:35] <blindMoe> http://jsfiddle.net/aj3v8/9/
[12:08:37] <blindMoe> like that?
[12:08:42] <blindMoe> just needed to get rid of the :first
[12:08:59] <blindMoe> you were running into a problem because 'f' was already set and not being reset on click to grab the new number of elements
[12:09:12] <nail_> khmer: that's because after the 1st click, the 2nd input is really 'f', so when you click a second time, 'f' is being "moved and inserted after the first input", then gets cloned for the 2nd element that matches .upload_field, then replaces itself with that cloned version
[12:09:18] <nail_> if you see what I mean :/
[12:09:44] <unseensoul> blindMoe, pretty much but I would need the var f = $('.upload_field').clone(); outside the function for what I am doing :S
[12:09:57] <blindMoe> unseensoul: it can't work that way
[12:10:07] <nail_> then on the 3d call the 2nd input is now a clone of the original 'f', so 'f' is now inserted after the 1st input, gets cloned, and inserted after the 2nd input which is now a clone
[12:10:15] <nail_> damn it's hard to express :)
[12:10:17] <blindMoe> because it won't match 'all' new elements that you add properly
[12:10:56] <khmer> nail_: wait, i think i get it
[12:11:00] <khmer> nail_: ahaaaaa
[12:11:05] <unseensoul> blindMoe, using my initial code it should
[12:11:28] <PSvils> Hey all
[12:11:39] <PSvils> I was wondering if anyone could quickly help me sort out a SWFObject issue?
[12:11:52] <PSvils> problem is that it...well...it simply isn't working
[12:12:20] <PSvils> I used code from one of the examples on the page here: http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/features
[12:12:26] <nail_> khmer: you can see that by doing $('#foo').after($('#foo')), <--- no more #foo
[12:12:38] <PSvils> I'm sure it's something small and stupid I'm missing... :/
[12:13:17] <PSvils> goin afk for a bit, but I will be back on soon!

[13:04:00] <RoosterJuice> when you are using a selector to find elements, does it return partial matches automatically?
[13:04:34] <ajpiano> what's a "partial match"
[13:05:32] <zambedu> gehsekky hiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[13:05:38] <RoosterJuice> like if I have a div with an id of 'dd_my_stuff'  can i select it with $('#dd')?
[13:05:48] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice: no
[13:05:53] <RoosterJuice> is there a way to?
[13:05:54] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice: there are selectors for that

[13:08:19] <Zzaichik> that are free, that is.
[13:08:25] <gehsekky> we just got them as a client at work
[13:08:53] <Zzaichik> NCAA?
[13:08:56] <gehsekky> yep
[13:09:31] <Zzaichik> that's pretty cool man. I'd ask building what but you probably can't really answer that. haha
[13:09:46] <gehsekky> we deliver custom news
[13:09:55] <gehsekky> so they'll probably want a sports-centered news briefing
[13:10:31] <gehsekky> our webified products use jquery, hence me being in this channel ;)
[13:10:48] <Zzaichik> hehe, cool.
[13:20:49] <xp_prg> if i have two <input type='submit' buttons in my form, how do I select one button to bind to as opposed to the other button?
[13:21:00] <xp_prg> can you give a button an id or is there a better way to do this?
[13:22:08] <xmaddness> Don't makie them submits. Fire off the sumbit via js
[13:22:30] <xp_prg> well I really just want a button for the user to click on to do some javascript stuff
[13:22:30] <smplstk> ?:jas
[13:22:33] <xmaddness> careful for regression to older browsers and no scripts tho

[13:22:48] <xp_prg> the only way I know to make a button is with <input type='submit'

[13:23:54] <xmaddness> yeh
[13:24:19] <Zzaichik> in other words, giving it an id will work.
[13:24:25] <xmaddness> one way yes
[13:25:18] <majicpanda> http://jsfiddle.net/VNjVv/ <- can anyone tell me why that would prevent the class after it to not even show up in inspect element? its like theres a syntax issue or something
[13:25:28] <majicpanda> but the code itself works
[13:25:47] <majicpanda> i have a class .buttonLink { } right after it in my css code and its like its not even being read
[13:26:38] <RoosterJuice> ajpiano, do I have to have a name attribute on all of the elements then? or can i use id?
[13:26:48] <ajpiano> id is an attribute
[13:26:59] <ajpiano> it's "any attribute starts with such and  such a string"
[13:27:04] <ajpiano> not "name attribute starts with.."
[13:27:51] <RoosterJuice> what about class?
[13:28:10] <ajpiano> ?tias
[13:28:11] <bot-t> Try It And See
[13:28:12] <RoosterJuice> i'm guessing ya

[14:18:39] <RoosterJuice> can you create events for elements that don't exist yet?
[14:19:13] <RoosterJuice> for example, when I add a button, I want it to have X functionality
[14:19:14] <josefig> how can I verify if an id is a children of a div ? the divs has the same class $(".param_option")
[14:20:18] <NoiseEee> RoosterJuice: use event delgation on a common parent.  $('#commonParentID').on('click
[14:20:31] <NoiseEee> RoosterJuice: use event delgation on a common parent.  $('#commonParentID').on('click','.classICareAbout',function() {} );
[14:20:45] <NoiseEee> and add buttons that have the class you care about
[14:21:03] <devinrayolsen> anyone know how to do something like this "theCurrentDate (05/12/2012) - anOlderDate (05/12/1990) = difference of how many days is?"
[14:29:02] <rroelofs> devinrayolsen: it depends on what you mean by day.  you can convert both to js date objects and subtract  milliseconds and multipy by millisecs / day
[14:29:17] <rroelofs> Otherwise I'd suggest memeto
[14:29:42] <devinrayolsen> days needs to be a number.
[14:29:52] <devinrayolsen> but not a formatted date.
[14:30:32] <rroelofs> yes, but is a day = to (24 * 3600 * 10000)?
[14:31:01] <rroelofs> what about partial days?
[14:34:28] <savid> How do I get the position of a child element within a set of matched elements?   kind of like  indexOf?
[14:35:02] <savid> oh, nm.  just found it.  .index()
[14:44:45] <JonathanNeal> Hello!
[14:49:37] <RoosterJuice> is there something special I need to know about the .on() function?  everytime i try to use it on something, it say the element has no function "on"
[14:50:17] <ajpiano> what's the error that you're getting
[14:51:01] <RoosterJuice> TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on'
[14:51:20] <ajpiano> what version of jquery are you using
[14:52:37] <RoosterJuice> 1.4.2
[14:52:47] <RoosterJuice> lol
[14:52:48] <RoosterJuice> oh
[14:52:50] <ajpiano> lol
[14:52:55] <RoosterJuice> wow
[14:52:57] <RoosterJuice> that is old
[14:52:58] <ajpiano> on is in 1.7
[14:53:37] <MaxSan> can anyone help me with a few lines of code
[14:53:42] <tw2113> old jquery is old
[14:53:44] <MaxSan> jquery is not my strong point
[14:54:29] <MaxSan> https://gist.github.com/2047233
[14:54:40] <MaxSan> i think its self explanatory what its trying to do
[14:54:45] <MaxSan> im sure thats all thats needed ><
[14:54:59] <ajpiano> MaxSan: what's $("depiction")
[14:55:11] <MaxSan> its an image tag in html
[14:55:22] <ajpiano> is that it's id?
[14:55:24] <ajpiano> its*
[14:55:29] <MaxSan> yes
[14:55:35] <ajpiano> $("#depiction")
[14:57:11] <MaxSan> hmmm
[14:57:16] <MaxSan> doesnt do what expected still
[14:57:25] <MaxSan> maybe its a css issue tho or something?
[14:57:35] <MaxSan> if you go to the site you can see what im trying to achieve on my own site
[14:58:05] <ajpiano> maybe you need to put the preventDefault back in?
[14:59:03] <MaxSan> the default is just a chemical formulae too
[14:59:12] <MaxSan> speeds up testing
[14:59:18] <MaxSan> i assumed that was only needed if blank
[14:59:20] <ajpiano> you are assuming i know what site you're talking about
[14:59:21] <MaxSan> or the likes
[14:59:24] <zalun> booststrap is partially adde to jsfiddle (only js for now)
[14:59:27] <ajpiano> and a lot of other things that i dont' know about your app
[14:59:35] <zalun> s/boost/boot/
[14:59:41] <MaxSan> the site is in the code
[14:59:42] <ajpiano> zalun: awesome
[14:59:45] <MaxSan> for the working version
[15:00:00] <MaxSan> im doing the same thing basically with just the picture
[15:00:03] <ajpiano> zalun: now just put jquery ui 1.8.17 to go with jquery 1.7.1
[15:00:14] <zalun> :)
[15:00:25] <zalun> is it in google's api ?
[15:00:36] <ajpiano> yep
[15:00:52] <zalun> ok then
[15:00:56] <MaxSan> =/
[15:01:04] <ajpiano> MaxSan: that redirects me to some 404
[15:01:08] <ajpiano> or opsin request failed

[15:13:33] <savid> I'm using jQuery's recommended plugin template, but I'm having a problem with how to access the jQuery element from within one of my plugin's functions.  Anyone have any idea how to do this?
[15:13:54] <RoosterJuice> maybe i have to update jquery tools aswell?
[15:14:24] <savid> For example, with this template:   http://pastie.org/3604259   how does one access the $element from within the "show" function?
[15:14:39] <savid> When I use "this",  it's simply a reference to the "methods" object
[15:15:00] <ajpiano> lol this is my code
[15:15:10] <ajpiano> or maybe it isn't
[15:15:13] <ajpiano> savid: it's 'this'
[15:15:39] <bartmax> someone can help me creating a bindingHandler in knockout to select text on focus ?
[15:15:46] <blindMoe> ajpiano: did you write jquery tooltop?
[15:15:52] <ajpiano> blindMoe: no
[15:16:02] <ajpiano> i actually recognised some minor thing about this
[15:16:06] <ajpiano> it's actually ralph's code ithink
[15:16:12] <blindMoe> ahh
[15:16:24] * blindMoe goes back to magento / solr integration ( bleh )
[15:16:54] <ajpiano> savid:  the 'apply' method makes it so the method is invoked with the current jquery set is 'this'
[15:17:09] <Offlein> On my Website's login form, can I POST the user's credentials via AJAX to another webapp's login page [in the same domain] before submitting the first's form and have the end-user still receive the Webapp's successful login cookie in the background just as if they'd logged in using the webapp's own login form?
[15:18:14] <MaxSan> hmmm
[15:18:20] <MaxSan> it says $ is not defined
[15:18:34] <MaxSan> i thought $ is like... jquery basically lol
[15:18:51] <savid> ajpiano, ok, I'll double check to make sure that part's being done correctly.

[15:27:16] <Blaster> Say I have 4 of these, how do I remove them all? <input type="hidden" name="someName[]" value="123" />
[15:27:28] <Blaster> I tried $('input[name="someName"]').remove();
[15:27:32] <tbenzige> hey all! i'm looking for a web developer interested in partnering up with me on a side project having to do with church sheet music. please PM me if interested
[15:27:41] <bartmax> having problems with $(input).focus(function() {this.select()})
[15:27:49] <Faryshta> Bogdaniel, you forgot the ;
[15:28:47] <bartmax> $('input').focus(function() {this.select()})â not working! : http://jsfiddle.net/WVRDT/
[15:28:49] <Faryshta> Bogdaniel, that code takes all the <a> tags and show them. But it can only work if they have "display:none" style.
[15:28:53] <Blaster> Nevermind.  It turned out to be $('input[name="someName[]"]')
[15:29:02] <Bogdaniel> http://notey.it/n/NGI
[15:29:06] <Bogdaniel> like this Faryshta ? :D
[15:29:12] <Faryshta> bartmax, use $(this)
[15:29:50] <bartmax> Faryshta: it's the same, the input got selected and deselected after
[15:29:54] <Faryshta> Bogdaniel, yes. That code will make all the links with "display:none" appear in 2 seconds.
[15:30:21] <Faryshta> Bogdaniel, I hope you don't get confused with fadeIn and fadeOut
[15:30:30] <Bogdaniel> nuop

[15:38:07] <Blaster> thang: try JsFiddle.net to make an example
[15:40:50] <savid> is it possible to cause a "warning" to come up in the javascript console, similar to how you'd do $.error() ?
[15:43:07] <felixqc> savid: console.log('lalalal');
[15:43:49] <savid> felixqc,  yeah, I'm aware of console.log.  Just curious if there's a way to flag it as a warning.  For example, chrome seems to have its own warnings go to the console with a special warning icon.
[15:45:04] <felixqc> you have console.debug, console.info, console.warn, and console.error.
[15:45:06] <miket3> is it possible to trigger enter key when tab key pressed?    when I alert(event.which)  tab key shows 0
[15:45:14] <felixqc> pick you display type :)
[15:46:09] <miket3> when entering text into a textarea i want tab key to simulate enter key
[15:46:35] <Zzaichik> that sounds not very user friendly
[15:46:49] <felixqc> user scary
[15:46:56] <miket3> Zzaichik, is that at me?
[15:46:59] <toocwa> Would anyone be able to help with this usage of sortable not working correctly in IE? http://www.privatepaste.com/4b6a7010f3
[15:47:06] <Zzaichik> miket3:  yeah.
[15:47:29] <savid> felixqc, awesome, thanks :)
[15:47:38] <toocwa> In every other browser if I sort a thumb it looks for #large_ with the same ID and then reorders that, and vice versa. but IE seems to get all confused
[15:47:40] <miket3> actually makes the field more friendly
[15:47:49] <miket3> it is only field on form
[15:48:00] <felixqc> savid: my pleasure
[15:48:09] <thang> Blaster: i was able to find an alternate solution, but this was my jsfiddle i was working with. http://jsfiddle.net/Suzuw/
[15:48:10] <Zzaichik> Cool. Yeah I don't know the answer to your question, but it doesn't sound like it's going to be a good idea. Then again, I don't know the circumstances either.
[15:48:44] <tbenzige> miket3: http://pastebin.com/gfFJ8eYm
[15:49:12] <tbenzige> providing that the keycode for tab is really 0
[15:49:32] <toocwa> It's mainly the $.each part and then the append() that I'm having trouble with in that snippet. You can ignore the outerHTML and $.post parts they work ok
[15:49:50] <miket3> tbenzige, thanks.  ill give it a try.    a few keys come back as 0
[15:49:52] <felixqc> keycode for tab is 9
[15:50:07] <miket3> which i think is ok.
[15:50:18] <Zzaichik> wuhoh, 9 or 13
[15:50:38] <felixqc> 9 ;)
[15:50:41] <tbenzige> 13 is enter
[15:50:41] <miket3> tab = 9 cr = 13
[15:50:43] <tbenzige> right?
[15:50:52] <felixqc> right
[15:52:11] <Zzaichik> nice.
[15:52:15] <felixqc> i'd like to catch 8, 16, 13, 17, 18 and prevent mouse move...
[15:52:36] <felixqc> remember the old days of crack searching
[15:54:37] <miket3> tbenzige, no go
[16:00:32] <felixqc> miket3: http://api.jquery.com/keydown/ the demo seems good
[16:08:02] <miket3> felixqc, i see that tab does show as 9
[16:09:03] <bartmax> better way to know which td im in besides : $this.closest('td').prevAll().length; ?

[17:53:56] <Majicpanda> jquery ui is a totally separate lib and you still have to include jquery on your page right?
[17:54:18] <austinbv> can $.ajax pass the responses query string to the browser?
[17:54:48] <austinbv> er to a callback
[17:58:49] <austinbv> let me elaborate googles api responds with an accesscode in a query param from a post, I would like to parse that response so I can continue along the auth chain
[18:00:06] <Majicpanda> did you do console.log to see what is returned? still not clear what you're getting back as a response
[18:00:25] <Majicpanda> you can console.log(data) if data is the function call and return
[18:00:29] <austinbv> hold on :)
[18:01:35] <Ziggy> If someone hovers over something very quickly that is supposed to make something appear, but hovers off very quickly again, just a few ms after he hovered over, can I somehow make it not show it?
[18:01:44] <Ziggy> I'm using .hover
[18:02:13] <eddiemonge> Ziggy: set a timer
[18:02:29] <Majicpanda> or hoverIntent?
[18:02:30] <eddiemonge> or look at  see ? hoverintent
[18:02:32] <bot-t> eddiemonge, hoverIntent - Plugins - jQuery - HoverIntent is similar to jQuery's hover. However, instead of calling onMouseOver and onMouseOut functions immediately, this plugin tracks the user's mouse onMouseOver and waits until it slows down... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent
[18:02:51] <Majicpanda> ^
[18:03:46] <Ziggy> let's say I'd use a timer, can I check the current state when showing then?
[18:17:16] <Abnormalex> is there a quick way to include once jQuery
[18:17:28] <Majicpanda> O_o
[18:17:37] <Abnormalex> o_O
[18:17:46] <Majicpanda> meaning..
[18:17:50] <plunkin> 0_0
[18:17:55] <Majicpanda> x_x
[18:17:56] <Abnormalex> you know, like PHP include_once
[18:17:59] <Abnormalex> and only once
[18:18:06] <plunkin> ._.
[18:18:15] <Majicpanda> same way you include any other .js file?
[18:18:23] <Abnormalex> i mean once
[18:18:28] <Abnormalex> its loading twice
[18:18:35] <Majicpanda> you must have it declared twice then?
[18:18:36] <Majicpanda> lol
[18:18:38] <Abnormalex> no
[18:18:42] <Abnormalex> its an extension
[18:18:51] <Abnormalex> i wrote, and its conflicting with an extension someone else wrote
[18:19:15] <Abnormalex> if jquery is detected , i dont want to declare it
[18:20:30] <Abnormalex> any ideaS?

[18:23:24] <yamahaalex37> wow
[18:23:26] <yamahaalex37> im sorry
[18:23:28] <yamahaalex37> i literally thought i was in #mac
[18:24:41] <chovy> wtf is that?
[18:28:31] <austinbv> lol
[18:35:11] <TimothyA> that, people, is a failed trollface
[18:35:38] <donCams> wow really?
[18:38:15] <coldhead> bot-t: tell yamahaalex37 i will never forget you
[18:38:16] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[18:38:28] <coldhead> that the hell is wrong with #mac anyway
[18:39:18] <donCams> coldhead: what does bot-t do when he doesn't forget somebody? :)
[18:41:28] <coldhead> he cherishes them in his heart forever
[18:41:35] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[18:45:33] <muzone> actually coldhead that was kinda well said, and i do love words so
[18:50:55] <youngin_> oh shit what is this fella up to now
[18:57:23] <[1]hemangpatel> hiii there
[18:57:44] <[1]hemangpatel> how to alert message on tab/browser close.?
[18:58:11] <muzone> dunno just made this but http://home.no/mritz/coldhead2.mp3
[18:58:15] <[1]hemangpatel> i searched on google but in all example it alert on refresh also..
[19:00:11] <[1]hemangpatel> anyone ?
[19:02:30] <[1]hemangpatel> how to alert message on tab/browser close.?
[19:04:26] <ajpiano> [1]hemangpatel: there's no way to differentiate an unload even because they're leaving the page to refresh or go to another page from leaving the page because they closed the window or tab
[19:06:52] <youngin_> muzone: nice
[19:07:04] <youngin_> cant wait to see what it sounds like after u spent some more time on it
[19:22:08] <muzone> youngin_: sorry man i had to run out for a sec
[19:22:10] <muzone> thanks for that
[19:22:15] <muzone> we'll see what happens
[19:22:52] <youngin_> cool no worries
[19:22:57] <youngin_> how much time you spend on the thing anyway?
[19:23:25] <muzone> nah that one was real quick
[19:23:28] <muzone> too quick to admit:-)
[19:23:48] <youngin_> sweet
[19:24:21] <youngin_> well if you're bidding for coldhead's love i'd say you're doing a pretty good job at it
[19:24:55] <_Pepper> lol, nice time to enter chat, some bidding for coldhead's love :)
[19:26:48] <_Pepper> in jQuery mobile, what is the best approach to creating and inserting dynamic content in pages? Also I want these pages to be served up with a dialog box. Thoughts?
[19:28:14] <_Pepper> when I mean inserting dynamic content I mean that jQuery will go gather some stuff from various sources ( json file, etc ) and then create a listview which could be accessed via a dialog effect from a link I would create on the page. Anyone?
[19:41:14] <ziz> hey guys, trying to learn jquery, and I learn by doing, anyone know of a tutorial on how to do something where I have a picture/div and I want a description to show (scroll up or down) over it on a mouse hover
[19:43:50] <Krinkle> ziz: you'll probably want to start with .hover() and .slideDown() / slideUp()
[19:44:38] <ziz> when I mean learn, i mean, that doesnt make any sense
[19:45:17] <Krinkle> var $('.myapp-picturecontainers').hover(function in() { $(this).find('.myapp-picture-desc').slideDown(); }, function out() { $(this).find('.myapp-picture-desc').slideUp(); });
[19:45:18] <ziz> but I'll google around
[19:45:20] <Krinkle> something like that
[19:46:28] <majicpanda> Can jquery very well handle animating a sprite, replacing it when it reaches a certain point, then returning to original spot?
[19:46:29] <ziz> thanks but all gibberish haha
[19:49:52] <yamahaalex37> I cant use $document.ready, because this is a script to detect if jQuery is already loaded!
[19:49:53] <bot-t> (1 hour 11 mins ago) <coldhead> tell yamahaalex37 i will never forget you
[19:50:06] <yamahaalex37> lol
[19:50:29] <spersaud> how can I do this in jquery or what is wrong ? http://pastebin.com/wcAZPZYb
[19:51:46] <spersaud> I fixed the semicolon ..
[19:52:02] <yamahaalex37> so im not muted...
[19:52:04] <yamahaalex37> sorry coldhead
[19:55:46] <yamahaalex37> is it faster to load jquery localy or from microsoft
[19:55:50] <yamahaalex37> (i think MS beats google)
[19:55:57] <yamahaalex37> and its usually cached anyway
[20:00:35] <tw2113> would using jquery/js to disable a submit button be a good solution for making people have to confirm that they "read" agreement terms?
[20:01:08] <yamahaalex37> no, you cant prove anyone read anything
[20:01:35] <tw2113> not sure the actual reading is important
[20:01:41] <letterpress> a little jquery in the console and they didn't check nothin'
[20:01:54] <tw2113> just getting to the point of using a checkmark saying 'yeah yeah yeah, let me in"
[20:02:08] <yamahaalex37> say "click here if you agree"
[20:02:31] <letterpress> yup and post that to the server to validate
[20:03:10] <tw2113> damn, i was hoping for the laziest route possible
[20:03:26] <Progster> what web server are you using tw2113?
[20:03:29] <nonotza> say I have a form in a modal. is the only way to do form validation within the modal through an ajax request?
[20:03:49] <tw2113> i assume your regular lamp stack
[20:04:25] <yamahaalex37> tw2113, a checkbox is pretty damn fast and eays
[20:04:26] <yamahaalex37> easy
[20:05:11] <spersaud> yamahaalex37: so far you have not answered my question in you want to remain on the job, please answer
[20:05:20] <spersaud> *if
[20:05:28] <yamahaalex37> I QUIT!
[20:07:52] <spersaud> yamahaalex37: ahaha
[20:08:12] <spersaud> yamahaalex37: my code used to work, stopped working all of a sudden ..
[20:12:34] <yamahaalex37> how can i prevent jquery from conflicting with itself, if it is called twice/
[20:13:55] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Depends on what you mean by calling twice and conflicting
[20:14:22] <yamahaalex37> i wrote an extension that uses jquery. one client using my extension uses an extension from another author that also calls jquery
[20:14:38] <yamahaalex37> it causes a conflict and my module does not work
[20:15:29] <yamahaalex37> now Im adding a window.onload function(if jQuery)etc... but its noticeably slower. I can see the page load, then my module snap into place after the window loads
[20:16:51] <yamahaalex37> any ideas?
[20:16:58] <Eviltwin> Well setting window.onload is probably the best way to cause a conflict of some kind
[20:17:07] <Eviltwin> Not to mention make it break horribly if it's loaded after the page loads
[20:17:14] <yamahaalex37> cause a conflict?
[20:17:27] <yamahaalex37> window.onload was never used, except now to try and prevent the conflict
[20:18:01] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37:  <script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[20:18:36] <yamahaalex37> window.jQuery?
[20:18:37] <Eviltwin> I'm still not sure what kind of conflict you're referring to
[20:18:51] <yamahaalex37> ive googled it, apparently jquery being called twice can cause conflicts
[20:18:55] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: yes. thats how you can tell if jquery is loaded
[20:19:20] <kenthree> does :checked not work on radio inputs? I'm running $(':checked').size() on the console and getting 0. but works for checkboxes
[20:19:32] <yamahaalex37> and should I perform this check after window.onload?
[20:19:54] <yamahaalex37> because I need to make sure at least the <head> loaded, to know if someone elses extension has jquery
[20:20:03] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: you should perform that check as soon as possible so you can load jquery if its not loaded
[20:20:07] <yamahaalex37> otherwise, if mine checks before his fires, its useless
[20:20:25] <eddiemonge> kenthree: dont use .size().  .length is better and it should work.
[20:20:32] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, but how can I know his just hasn't loaded yet?
[20:20:48] <Eviltwin> Although a lot of plugins just require you to have jQuery loaded when you load them
[20:21:13] <eddiemonge> unless the scripts are loading asynchronously, itll work
[20:21:34] <yamahaalex37> the scripts are probably loaded asynchronously
[20:21:39] <yamahaalex37> whenever each extension is added
[20:21:56] <yamahaalex37> if my extension is added before his, it will check jquery, load it, then his loads and conflicts
[20:22:19] <eddiemonge> thats not something you can control
[20:22:27] <yamahaalex37> i cant know that my extension is going to be loaded last. is there any way to check sooner than window.onload
[20:22:30] <eddiemonge> if they are writing bad plugins, you cant control that
[20:23:08] <eddiemonge> you could use noconflict for yours but it wont be as efficient since multiple jquerys can still be loaded but not affect each other
[20:23:11] <yamahaalex37> and checking at window.onload is bad?
[20:23:19] <yamahaalex37> yeah im already using noconflict for mootools
[20:23:21] <eddiemonge> yes. theres no reason to do that
[20:23:32] <eddiemonge> listen to what Eviltwin says. i approve
[20:25:43] <kenthree> i'm really at a loss here $('[checked=checked]') returns results but $(':checked') doesn't (for radios only). Anyone got reasoning for this or should I just deal with it
[20:27:14] <yamahaalex37> im loading my script thru a script
[20:27:20] <yamahaalex37> why does changing from this to this break my jquery?
[20:27:22] <yamahaalex37> script.src = 'modules/mod_aceLoginRegister/tmpl/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js';
[20:27:28] <yamahaalex37> script.src = 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js';
[20:27:43] <Eviltwin> Probably because the first one wasa in your cache
[20:28:06] <Eviltwin> And script loading will happen asynchronously after load
[20:28:06] <Robbo_> Does anyone know how I could get this error?
[20:28:07] <Robbo_> Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [href=#main-category.1]
[20:28:13] <Eviltwin> i.e. not in any particular error
[20:28:17] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, i dont get it?
[20:28:29] <yamahaalex37> its not loading at all
[20:28:38] <Robbo_> I remove any trace of that ID and still get it when creating jQuery tabs
[20:28:56] <ziz> Maybe someone can help me with my retarded question.. When should you call a .js file in the header, and when in the footer?
[20:29:18] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, so its not going to work?
[20:29:31] <kenthree> if in the head it will load before the page renders (during white screen)
[20:29:41] <Eviltwin> Correct
[20:29:51] <Eviltwin> Well before DOM ready
[20:29:59] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, why will loading jquery thru google cdn not work?
[20:30:04] <Eviltwin> At the bottom it will happen pretty much once the DOM is ready
[20:30:05] <yamahaalex37> i can see it loaded properly in head
[20:31:34] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: http://jsfiddle.net/HRD9G/
[20:31:42] <Eviltwin> Why doesn't this work properly
[20:31:54] <yamahaalex37> uhhh
[20:32:02] <Eviltwin> If you look in the console, you'll see the result is always "undefined" and that an error happens after we see the undefined
[20:32:25] <yamahaalex37> but Eviltwin , in google dev tools, i can see the jquery successfully loaded in <head>
[20:33:12] <kenthree> what's the syntax for multiple attributes? [attr=first, attr2]?
[20:33:16] <Eviltwin> Fine, http://jsfiddle.net/HRD9G/1/
[20:33:20] <Eviltwin> Now the request is successful
[20:33:30] <Eviltwin> And yet I'm still not seeing the HTML for the homepage
[20:33:31] <Eviltwin> Why?
[20:33:33] <yamahaalex37> i dont get the correlation :/ im thick
[20:33:41] <yamahaalex37> ive loaded jquery cdn before...
[20:33:55] <Eviltwin> Can you answer the question?
[20:34:06] <Eviltwin> I'm assessing just how much I need to explain
[20:34:20] <Eviltwin> And that varies depending on your ability to answer the question
[20:34:35] <yamahaalex37> so your asking why the second request is successful not the first?
[20:35:11] <Eviltwin> Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/HRD9G/2/
[20:35:25] <Eviltwin> Why am I seeing "returned", undefined in the console?
[20:35:32] <Eviltwin> Why isn't it returning the HTML?
[20:35:51] <erebel55> lo
[20:35:51] <yamahaalex37> where is this "console"
[20:35:55] <Eviltwin> Oh boy
[20:35:57] <yamahaalex37> haha
[20:36:04] <yamahaalex37> ahh
[20:36:09] <yamahaalex37> google tools, console, at the top
[20:36:11] <yamahaalex37> returned undefined
[20:36:14] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:36:16] <Eviltwin> WHY?
[20:36:22] <erebel55> is there a way to select an svg? or put the svg in a div class or something? http://jsfiddle.net/m6N38/1/
[20:36:27] <Eviltwin> Have you ever worked with AJAX before?
[20:36:41] <yamahaalex37> this is like web 2.0 stuff
[20:36:44] <yamahaalex37> jk
[20:36:51] <yamahaalex37> most ive done with ajax is with jquery ajax
[20:36:52] <ziz> trying to integrate a 'plugin' that when I hover over an image, a caption about it comes up.. I'm also trying to learn jquery once i get it working.. but I can't seem to figure it out, I've pointed the .js file correctly, and put some <script> below the code http://six5webdesign.com/portfolio (it's the very last large image that I'm testing with)
[20:37:01] <ziz> if anyone could help I'd really appreciate it
[20:37:05] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Okay, so why isn't this AJAX working right?
[20:37:19] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Why is the function returning undefined instead of the HTML?
[20:37:27] <Eviltwin> You can see the line "success" followed by the HTML
[20:37:33] <Eviltwin> So it's clearly getting the HTML
[20:37:36] <Eviltwin> Why isn't it being returned?
[20:37:39] <yamahaalex37> your asking for an url before it loaded...?
[20:37:43] <yamahaalex37> random gues...
[20:38:11] <Eviltwin> Do you know what the first "A" in "AJAX" stands for?
[20:38:13] <yamahaalex37> oh
[20:38:22] <yamahaalex37> async
[20:38:24] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:38:30] <Eviltwin> Look at the order that those log messages happen in
[20:38:44] <Eviltwin> We actually see the "returned" log message before the "success" log message
[20:38:52] <yamahaalex37> you pass (data) argument
[20:39:00] <yamahaalex37> but dont define it
[20:39:49] <Eviltwin> Okay, what does async mean?
[20:39:56] <yamahaalex37> not at the same time
[20:41:30] <Eviltwin> I'm going to put some labels in this and I'm going to ask you the order that those statements run in
[20:41:35] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/HRD9G/3/
[20:41:36] <yamahaalex37> ok
[20:41:44] <Eviltwin> If the letters were code
[20:41:53] <Eviltwin> Function calls or alerts or whatever
[20:41:57] <Eviltwin> What order would they run in?
[20:42:16] <Eviltwin> Which one would happen first then which one next and so on
[20:42:27] <yamahaalex37> um
[20:43:01] <yamahaalex37> A. B. C. G
[20:43:19] <yamahaalex37> and D.E / H.I same time after C.G ?
[20:43:33] <xp_prg> what is the best way to do a warning/confirmation popup?
[20:43:33] <yamahaalex37> i am guessing...
[20:43:47] <Eviltwin> The actual order is A, G, B, C, F, H, I, D, E
[20:44:13] <yamahaalex37> woah....
[20:44:21] <Eviltwin> Between lines B and C, I'm declaring a new variable "theData"
[20:44:24] <Eviltwin> (defaults to undefined)
[20:44:27] <yamahaalex37> i thought js was procedural
[20:44:28] <yamahaalex37> meaning in order
[20:44:31] <yamahaalex37> functions called in order
[20:44:45] <Eviltwin> The after line F, I'm returning theData (which is undefined)
[20:44:47] <Eviltwin> That was in order
[20:44:53] <yamahaalex37> A G?
[20:44:56] <ziz> Anyone? Please
[20:45:02] <Eviltwin> timmywil: Well I haven't called it yet
[20:45:04] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:45:10] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: I haven't called it at that point
[20:45:14] <Eviltwin> I don't call it until between G and H
[20:45:23] <yamahaalex37> oh yeah
[20:45:25] <yamahaalex37> syrr
[20:45:27] <yamahaalex37> sryh
[20:45:47] <Eviltwin> Now the other thing is that only one thing happens at a time in JavaScript
[20:45:58] <eddiemonge> ?ask @ ziz
[20:45:58] <bot-t> ziz, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:46:03] <Eviltwin> There can be stuff happening elsewhere in the browser that helps the JavaScript
[20:46:16] <ziz> eddiemonge I did ask
[20:46:20] <ziz> trying to integrate a 'plugin' that when I hover over an image, a caption about it comes up.. I'm also trying to learn jquery once i get it working.. but I can't seem to figure it out, I've pointed the .js file correctly, and put some <script> below the code http://six5webdesign.com/portfolio (it's the very last large image that I'm testing with)
[20:46:21] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, so with ajax the function begins and returns at the same time? CF?
[20:46:24] <Eviltwin> For example the fetching of that file is going to happen simultaneously but the success function won't run until there's a break
[20:46:43] <Eviltwin> Well it's what's called an asynchronous function call
[20:47:01] <Eviltwin> You've told it to do work but it returns before it's finished
[20:47:04] <eddiemonge> ziz: did you look at the console?
[20:47:10] <Eviltwin> And instead calls the success function when it's finished
[20:47:17] <Eviltwin> This lets your program keep doing more work while it's waiting
[20:47:18] <ziz> eddiemonge: console?
[20:47:18] <yamahaalex37> thats crazy... how can it return what is not yet something
[20:47:56] <eddiemonge> ?ftj @ ziz
[20:47:56] <bot-t> ziz, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[20:48:41] <Eviltwin> While it's a different function, this is also asynchronous: http://jsfiddle.net/sWpbK/
[20:48:53] <Eviltwin> Look at the order in the console
[20:49:00] <Eviltwin> A, C, B
[20:49:17] <ziz> eddiemonge yeah I use firebug, but typically for css..
[20:49:38] <yamahaalex37> yeah that makes sense
[20:49:42] <eddiemonge> ziz: use it for debugging JS.
[20:49:47] <ziz> I'm getting [jquery.form] terminating; zero elements found by selector
[20:49:51] <Eviltwin> The $.ajax works the same way
[20:49:56] <Eviltwin> Except it calls the function when the data is ready
[20:49:59] <Eviltwin> And passes it as an argument
[20:49:59] <yamahaalex37> but i dont get why the AF in the last one. function called and returned at the same time? before function is processed?
[20:50:01] <Eviltwin> Instead of waiting 100ms
[20:50:21] <Eviltwin> It's A, G, B, C, F, H, I, D, E
[20:50:27] <Eviltwin> What part doesn't make sense?
[20:50:29] <eddiemonge> ziz: you dont see the uncaught syntaxerror?
[20:50:34] <yamahaalex37> CF
[20:50:57] <Eviltwin> It's the same reason it's A, C, B in the second one
[20:51:17] <Eviltwin> $.ajax starts the request but doesn't wait for it to finish
[20:51:27] <Eviltwin> Instead it promises to call the function you specified as "success" once it is done
[20:51:38] <Eviltwin> Just like setTimeout doesn't run that code, it promises to run it after 100ms
[20:51:48] <ziz> eddiemonge: sorry,  very noob to this, trying to learn while doing
[20:52:19] <eddiemonge> ziz: read that whole guide and it should help.
[20:52:25] <ziz> now I'm getting Uncaught Error: "create" can only be used in extension processes. See the content scripts documentation for more details.
[20:52:29] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Remember that there is a difference between defining a function and running a function
[20:52:51] <Eviltwin> For example if I got rid of the var output = getData() line, the order would be A, G, H, I
[20:52:56] <Eviltwin> Nothing in the function would ever run
[20:52:56] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, who sets the 100ms
[20:53:03] <yamahaalex37> oh on the last one
[20:53:04] <yamahaalex37> nvm
[20:53:43] <yamahaalex37> ok wait im sorry this makes sense now
[20:53:50] <Eviltwin> Okay
[20:53:57] <yamahaalex37> but you cant be sure that H will happen before D
[20:54:04] <Eviltwin> Actually I can
[20:54:10] <yamahaalex37> because C and F start at the same time?
[20:54:14] <Eviltwin> JavaScript doesn't get interrupted
[20:54:30] <Eviltwin> As long as your code is doing some kind of work, asynchronous callbacks won't fire, they'll get queued
[20:54:31] <yamahaalex37> ok
[20:54:40] <Eviltwin> And as soon as your program stops doing work, then they run in order
[20:54:51] <yamahaalex37> really... so like after window.onload?
[20:54:55] <yamahaalex37> after allll your js stopped
[20:54:58] <yamahaalex37> what about event listeners...
[20:55:31] <Eviltwin> You have the chrome console open right?
[20:55:35] <yamahaalex37> yeah
[20:55:53] <Eviltwin> Have you used breakpoints before?
[20:56:12] <yamahaalex37> no
[20:56:30] <Eviltwin> Okay, if you want to learn more about debugging JavaScript, I suggest you see ?ftj
[20:56:30] <bot-t> Okay, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[20:56:35] <Eviltwin> But do that later
[20:56:40] <Eviltwin> I'll try to explain wihtout
[20:57:27] <yamahaalex37> that was awesome lesson
[20:57:30] <Eviltwin> So let's say you have window.onload = function() { $("#x").click(function() { console.log("clicked!"); for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++) { $("#x").click(); } }
[20:57:49] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:57:57] <yamahaalex37> yes im ready for mroe
[20:58:00] <Eviltwin> Let me just make a paste for this
[20:58:02] <yamahaalex37> ok
[21:00:11] <Eviltwin> I'm actually having a hard time thinking how to explain this without breakpoints
[21:00:27] <Eviltwin> I'll go this route
[21:00:41] <Eviltwin> So let's say you have a window.onload = function() { A(); ... Z(); };
[21:00:58] <Eviltwin> Basically you're doing a bunch of stuff in there and calling a lot of functions
[21:01:18] <yamahaalex37> ok
[21:01:20] <Eviltwin> From the time that you enter that function (just before you call A()) until the time that you exit that function (just after you call Z())
[21:01:26] <Eviltwin> No other event listeners will fire
[21:01:47] <Eviltwin> As soon as you do exit that function, JavaScript will basically be idle
[21:01:54] <yamahaalex37> if the event listener is called before a?
[21:01:57] <Eviltwin> At which point other event listeners can be fired
[21:02:21] <Eviltwin> If the load event happens before this other event, then you're guaranteed that A() through Z() will run before the other event's event listener
[21:02:41] <Eviltwin> If the other event happens before load, you're guaranteed that all of the code in that listener will happen before A() happens
[21:02:46] <Eviltwin> That's the promise
[21:02:56] <Eviltwin> Synchronous code happens synchronously
[21:03:00] <Eviltwin> JavaScript is single-threaded
[21:03:33] <Eviltwin> This is actually a convienence for you
[21:03:38] <Eviltwin> It prevents what are called race conditions
[21:03:46] <yamahaalex37> ok
[21:03:56] <Eviltwin> Where the order of code isn't known and therefore unpredictable things can happen
[21:04:08] <yamahaalex37> so a() thru z() are ajax=async?
[21:04:15] <Eviltwin> They can be whatever
[21:04:37] <Eviltwin> But from the time you make the call to A() until the time Z() returns, no other event listeners are going to fire
[21:04:54] <Eviltwin> This is why you don't want to do things like while(!window.jQuery) { /* wait */ }
[21:05:10] <Eviltwin> Say that was somewhere between A and Z
[21:05:30] <Eviltwin> It would cause that .onload function to wait until window.jQuery was defined, blocking all other events until it is
[21:06:01] <Eviltwin> And technically once it stops running it will never stop
[21:06:10] <Eviltwin> Because it never does anything to try to make jQuery be loaded
[21:06:32] <Eviltwin> New scripts added to the DOM won't run until the JavaScript that is currently running finishes and becomes idle
[21:06:46] <yamahaalex37> ok i understand
[21:06:47] <yamahaalex37> mostly
[21:06:48] <Eviltwin> This is why we use async and why we do things in an asynchronous nature
[21:06:56] <Eviltwin> Now how this relates to your original issue
[21:07:04] <Eviltwin> When you do script.src = "...";
[21:07:12] <Eviltwin> It's not going to wait for that script to load before it runs the next line
[21:07:22] <yamahaalex37> makes sence
[21:07:24] <Eviltwin> You may have 12 scripts you want to load and you don't want to make them all wait until the previous one has loaded
[21:07:29] <yamahaalex37> but in html dom, it would
[21:07:45] <Eviltwin> Scripts are promised to run in order if they are in the HTML that comes down from the server
[21:07:51] <yamahaalex37> ok
[21:07:52] <Eviltwin> After that all bets are off
[21:07:54] <Eviltwin> It's all asynchronous
[21:08:04] <yamahaalex37> so how to synchronize?
[21:08:13] <yamahaalex37> i know jquery has callbacks
[21:08:40] <Eviltwin> What you want to do is wait for the load event on that script element
[21:08:49] <Eviltwin> Once that load event happens, the script is run
[21:09:14] <Eviltwin> In fact this is jQuery's async script loader: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[21:09:53] <yamahaalex37> i thought we wanted a sync script loader
[21:09:59] <yamahaalex37> or wait sorry
[21:10:03] <yamahaalex37> javascript is sync by default?
[21:10:11] <yamahaalex37> no...
[21:10:11] <Eviltwin> The last code block here is how you can do it without jQuery: http://friendlybit.com/js/lazy-loading-asyncronous-javascript/
[21:10:32] <Eviltwin> Most browsers won't let you load JavaScript synchronously
[21:10:52] <yamahaalex37> ok
[21:10:55] <Eviltwin> The same way it's considered a bad practice to do sync AJAX
[21:11:11] <Eviltwin> It can take a while to download
[21:11:22] <Eviltwin> And you want your browser to be responsive while it's downloading
[21:11:37] <yamahaalex37> i do appreciate all this understanding
[21:11:41] <yamahaalex37> i need to know it
[21:11:57] <Eviltwin> Here's a repeating async AJAX call: http://jsfiddle.net/g9dT5/
[21:12:04] <Eviltwin> With an animation going at the same time
[21:12:10] <yamahaalex37> lol that looks fun
[21:12:12] <Eviltwin> Everything is smooth and nice
[21:12:12] <yamahaalex37> i awnt to make web games
[21:12:18] <Eviltwin> Now here's the same thing sync: http://jsfiddle.net/FStR5/
[21:12:29] <Eviltwin> Look what happens
[21:12:47] <yamahaalex37> ah thats very awesome
[21:12:52] <yamahaalex37> good think for async
[21:13:00] <Eviltwin> The whole browser actually locks up while the JavaScript is waiting there
[21:13:05] <Eviltwin> At least the whole window does
[21:13:06] <xp_prg> http://jsfiddle.net/tBNV8/  why isn't the jquery ui theme css stuff loading?
[21:14:28] <eddiemonge> because you didnt add it
[21:15:15] <xp_prg> how do I add it?
[21:15:24] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: All make sense how?
[21:15:26] <Eviltwin> now*
[21:15:28] <xp_prg> do I have to do <link rel='stylesheet' etc... ?
[21:15:33] <yamahaalex37> indeed, very much so
[21:15:41] <yamahaalex37> do you have a nice web dev job Eviltwin
[21:15:59] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: click the resources link on the left and add the url there
[21:16:02] <Eviltwin> Better than some, not as good as others
[21:16:10] <Eviltwin> I'm actually still a fulltime student
[21:16:17] <yamahaalex37> but you enjoy it? and you get to do pretty advanced stuff?
[21:16:21] <yamahaalex37> oh cool
[21:16:24] <Eviltwin> Yup and yup
[21:16:33] <yamahaalex37> i wish my school taught latest standards...
[21:16:54] <yamahaalex37> my teacher had my implement a cgi email script :/ I used php. I got marked off
[21:16:58] <Eviltwin> My school doesn't teach any of it, I had to pursue it on my own
[21:17:07] <yamahaalex37> ok, then i dont feel so alone
[21:17:27] <yamahaalex37> sometimes i think there is way too much to learn, i cant learn it all, ill never have the good jobs
[21:17:30] <yamahaalex37> can I pm you
[21:17:38] <Eviltwin> Sure
[21:18:02] <xp_prg> eddiemonge do you use jquery ui dialogue?
[21:18:22] <eddiemonge> if im using jqueryui yeah
[21:20:20] <xp_prg> eddiemonge I am confused about something lets say I am using jquery and I do a post, and I want to show a busy dialogue while it is working, should I let the user cancel and even if they do cancel, how can I abort the .post?
[21:22:44] <eddiemonge> var jqxhr = $.post();  jqxhr.abort()
[21:24:44] <xp_prg> oh wow cool
[21:25:07] <xp_prg> can you recommend a good way to show a spinner using jquery?
[21:25:23] <coldhead> $('#spinner').show()
[21:27:40] <xp_prg> coldhead I don't have a spinner gif, is there pure jquery way to do it?
[21:28:03] <coldhead> http://ajaxload.info/
[21:28:27] <tw2113> i guarantee there are spinner gifs you can go download
[21:28:57] <erebel55> any ideas why this isn't increasing the rect size when i click on it? http://jsfiddle.net/m6N38/4/
[21:29:03] <coldhead> and free smileys, right?
[21:29:14] <shcard> hello
[21:29:44] <xp_prg> coldhead I am confused how it becomes modal etc...
[21:29:53] <coldhead> erebel55: this doesn't seem to involve jQuery
[21:29:53] <Eviltwin> erebel55: There are sometimes some issues when crossing the boundary into an SVG document
[21:29:57] <coldhead> or even modern javascript
[21:30:02] <Eviltwin> I don't remember how to resolve them
[21:30:12] <coldhead> needs less onclick
[21:31:23] <yamahaalex37> does this look erroroneuos?
[21:31:24] <yamahaalex37> $(document).ready(function(){
[21:31:24] <yamahaalex37> 		$("head").append("<script src='modules/mod_aceLoginRegister/tmpl/js/default.js' type='text/javascript'></script>");
[21:31:24] <yamahaalex37> 	};
[21:31:54] <yamahaalex37> it is breaking everything
[21:32:35] <coldhead> erroneous*
[21:32:43] <coldhead> if you're going to use $2 words spell them right
[21:32:47] <xp_prg> coldhead can you please answer my question?
[21:32:55] <yamahaalex37> errororoneneous
[21:33:02] <yamahaalex37> who says its $2
[21:33:11] <coldhead> the dictionary
[21:33:18] <yamahaalex37> i want a refund
[21:33:22] <coldhead> the 5 cent word is "wrong"
[21:33:42] <yamahaalex37> i just used a $4 words you didnt even know about
[21:33:56] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: You appear to be missing a ) between the closing } and the ;
[21:33:57] <coldhead> xp_prg: you didn't ask a question, you just said you were confused by something and i was confused by what you were confused by

[21:38:17] <coldhead> let's just pretend i did anyway
[21:39:16] <coldhead> snovesyyy
[21:45:20] <nir0> hello guys, i got this: $('#items').hide('slide', {direction: 'left', ease: 'swing'}, 'fast'); $('#items_new').show('slide', {direction: 'right', ease: 'swing'}, 'fast');
[21:45:50] <nir0> what i get is slightly not exactly what i want
[21:46:07] <nir0> 'show' starts after 'hode' is complete
[21:46:14] <nir0> hide*
[21:46:28] <coldhead> that is so the human condition, nir0
[21:46:33] <coldhead> right there
[21:46:34] <nir0> and i want it run together
[21:47:53] <nir0> any suggestions?
[21:51:12] <coldhead> i would expect those to run almost simultaneously, really
[21:51:40] <yamahaalex37> gdamn!
[21:51:46] <coldhead> nir0: can you put a demo up at jsfiddle?
[21:51:59] <yamahaalex37> the whole reason i got into the jquery called twice conflict thing was this guys site

[21:52:04] <yamahaalex37> http://haterz.org/haterz/
[21:52:10] <erebel55> coldhead: can i pm you really quick?
[21:52:15] <yamahaalex37> thats my extensions, the login / register module you see
[21:52:19] <coldhead> only for cyber
[21:52:23] <yamahaalex37> and clicking register does not work
[21:52:45] <yamahaalex37> i disabled calling register jquery in my module, because he already called it, and apparently that doesnt help
[21:53:05] <yamahaalex37> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'fast'
[21:53:21] <erebel55> err lol
[21:54:11] <yamahaalex37> whyyy no fast :(
[21:55:07] <yamahaalex37> fast works fine when tested on my site
[21:56:36] <eddiemonge> the yoo_master one?
[21:56:50] <yamahaalex37> are you asking me
[21:56:53] <eddiemonge> sorry mean the LoginBlanco
[21:57:02] <yamahaalex37> no thats not mine
[21:57:05] <yamahaalex37> mine is AceLoginRegister
[21:57:20] <yamahaalex37> the red yellow and black one when this guys screen opens
[21:57:21] <yamahaalex37> http://haterz.org/haterz/
[21:57:38] <yamahaalex37> .toggle(toggleEffect1,'fast',function(){
[21:57:39] <eddiemonge> is your code in any public repo like github?
[21:57:52] <yamahaalex37> no, I should, i just got github yesterday
[21:57:57] <yamahaalex37> im not too familiar with it
[21:58:13] <yamahaalex37> do i need a git client on my pc
[21:59:33] <yamahaalex37> how can it not have fast
[21:59:36] <yamahaalex37> i see fast right there
[21:59:41] <yamahaalex37> in the 1.7.1 min
[21:59:47] <yamahaalex37> speeds:{slow:600,fast:200
[22:01:54] <yamahaalex37> =(
[22:04:16] <yamahaalex37> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'fast'
[22:04:25] <yamahaalex37> anyone seen anything like that, or can guess what would case it

[22:05:25] <eddiemonge> toggle( [duration] [, easing] [, callback] )
[22:05:33] <yamahaalex37> yes, and i used fast
[22:05:39] <yamahaalex37> and it works fine on my site
[22:05:43] <eddiemonge> you have duration and easing backwards
[22:05:47] <yamahaalex37> but for this person who downloaded my extensions, such an odd error
[22:05:51] <yamahaalex37> oh...
[22:06:06] <eddiemonge> what is toggleEffect1
[22:06:09] <yamahaalex37> easing = animation?
[22:06:27] <eddiemonge> oh you are using the jQueryUI toggle?
[22:06:35] <yamahaalex37> yes
[22:06:39] <yamahaalex37> toggleEffect1 is a variable
[22:07:04] <eddiemonge> whats it resolve to?
[22:07:08] <yamahaalex37> bounce
[22:07:09] <yamahaalex37> slide
[22:07:10] <yamahaalex37> etc
[22:07:49] <yamahaalex37> so theyre backwards
[22:08:07] <eddiemonge> no, they are right
[22:08:11] <yamahaalex37> aw crap
[22:08:17] <eddiemonge> what are you calling toggle on?
[22:08:20] <yamahaalex37> but its duration easing callback
[22:08:30] <eddiemonge> not for the UI one
[22:08:42] <eddiemonge> UI is toggle( effect, [options], [speed], [callback] )
[22:08:47] <yamahaalex37> how does jquery know the difference
[22:08:47] <nir0> coldhead: seems ok, thanks
[22:09:15] <eddiemonge> its based on the signature
[22:09:26] <yamahaalex37> damn i thought you solved it
[22:09:43] <eddiemonge> like i said, what are you calling it on? what collection?
[22:10:04] <yamahaalex37> im calling it on #alrContainRegister and #alrContainLogin

[22:14:08] <yamahaalex37> http://pastie.org/3605993
[22:14:32] <yamahaalex37> its the the two divs under <!-- REGISTER --> and <!-- LOGIN -->
[22:14:53] <eddiemonge> i dont see .toggle() anywhere there
[22:15:00] <yamahaalex37> its in the .js
[22:15:22] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ yamahaalex37
[22:15:22] <bot-t> yamahaalex37, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:15:36] <eddiemonge> but ignore the second part of that with the link to the site
[22:15:49] <eddiemonge> just put a demo on jsfiddle with simplified code
[22:16:27] <yamahaalex37> http://jsfiddle.net/4vMHa/
[22:16:32] <yamahaalex37> i wont be able to do a live demo
[22:16:37] <yamahaalex37> theres too much with joomlas crap
[22:16:54] <yamahaalex37> but you can see the <!-- LOGIN / REGISTER divs
[22:17:11] <yamahaalex37> and the  $("#btnSwitchRegister, #btnSwitchOneRegister").click(function(){ block
[22:17:13] <yamahaalex37> with the toggle effects
[22:17:26] <yamahaalex37> and the block below it for opposite
[22:18:17] <eddiemonge> you need to learn: show, hide, height, on, and val
[22:18:28] <yamahaalex37> what doy ou mean
[22:19:54] <eddiemonge> .prop("value", value) -> .val(value)
[22:20:10] <eddiemonge> .css('display','none') -> .hide()
[22:20:17] <yamahaalex37> oh lol
[22:20:18] <yamahaalex37> nice
[22:20:26] <eddiemonge> .css('height', value) -> .height(value)
[22:20:29] <yamahaalex37> jquery so many shortcuts
[22:21:08] <yamahaalex37> yup
[22:21:08] <yamahaalex37> wow
[22:21:12] <eddiemonge> im surprised you did .prop("value") instead of .val() since .val() is so basic and is in every tutorial whereas prop isnt
[22:21:19] <yamahaalex37> ive never followed a tutorial
[22:21:28] <yamahaalex37> just kinda grab code here and there and learn by implementing
[22:21:39] <yamahaalex37> and used js long before jQ
[22:21:53] <yamahaalex37> disabling his FCKING templates' jQuery call fixed all problems
[22:21:54] <yamahaalex37> wow
[22:22:03] <yamahaalex37> i spent so much time trying to debug and modify my code
[22:22:21] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[22:22:22] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:22:23] <Eviltwin> ?ftj
[22:22:23] <yamahaalex37> then again, its nothing on his templates error if there stuff works fine without mine
[22:22:24] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[22:22:38] <yamahaalex37> i said i used js long before jq
[22:23:28] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: thats why you need to check to see if jquery is loaded first or use noconflict to load your own, but checking first is better
[22:23:59] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, thats where this whole thing started. i wrote a javascript to check if jQ was loaded after window.onload
[22:24:05] <eddiemonge> and you should define toggleEffect1 somewhere in that code so you know its defined
[22:24:10] <yamahaalex37> but it was noticably slower, and Eviltwin said that could be incorrect
[22:24:28] <yamahaalex37> also, I am already using noconflict, but it is for mootools
[22:24:28] <Eviltwin> Wait, what am I being quoted on now?
[22:24:32] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: i thought that was resolved already. like by not waiting until window.onload
[22:24:52] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, but then my extension may fire before his, then what is the point of checking
[22:25:50] <yamahaalex37> also, toggleEffect1 and 2 is defined in php variables
[22:25:56] <Eviltwin> Setting window.onload replaces whatever else was in window.onload
[22:26:01] <Eviltwin> So it's considered a bad practice
[22:26:15] <Eviltwin> Instead use an attachEvent/addEventListener
[22:26:23] <yamahaalex37> k
[22:27:40] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, eddiemonge i sincerly appreciate your help. worst case, my extension now has an awesome back end "enable jQuery" button, which could help someone someday. in this case, it didnt matter, im going to recommend this guy delete his templates' jquery call
[22:34:22] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: its not up to you to decide if a user has jquery enabled or not. you should check to see if its loaded, if not queue it up to be loaded. like in wordpress you can add it to a queue to get loaded so its not loaded by everyone
[22:34:48] <yamahaalex37> eddiemonge, thats the point of my backend button
[22:34:56] <yamahaalex37> its up to them to decide if they need it
[22:35:26] <yamahaalex37> and like i said, different sites, different configurations, extensions will load in differnt orders
[22:35:51] <yamahaalex37> if my extension fires before another that loads jquery, then what is the point of checking
[22:35:54] <xp_prg> ok I have a dumb question, wouldn't a standard way to show a modal dialogue with a loading spinner on an ajax call be to use jquery ui dialogue and attach it to the ajax events?
[22:36:17] <yamahaalex37> i cant count on every other extensions loading after mine checking if jquery is loaded
[22:36:23] <yamahaalex37> xp_prg, spinner?
[22:36:48] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: what kind of "extension" is it?
[22:36:57] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: sure
[22:37:05] <yamahaalex37> its a login register slider module, the black red and yellow one when the curtains open
[22:37:08] <yamahaalex37> http://haterz.org/haterz/
[22:38:24] <eddiemonge> yamahaalex37: i mean is it just a script or an extension for a cms or what?
[22:38:39] <xp_prg> eddiemonge what are your favorite plugins for jquery just curious, specifically ui?
[22:38:47] <yamahaalex37> joomla extensions, contains at least 10 files, xml, php, js, and css
[22:38:57] <yamahaalex37> i mean joomla extension* singular
[22:40:33] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: my favorites are the ones i write for the current task at hand
[22:43:14] <xp_prg> eddiemonge you develop everything from the ground up?
[22:43:22] <xp_prg> I am talking about pre-built things that help get the job done
[22:49:27] <eddiemonge> most of the time i do write a lot of stuff from scratch or re-use my own personal library of plugins
[22:49:52] <xp_prg> that is hardcore
[22:50:03] <eddiemonge> not really.
[22:50:05] <xp_prg> I would rather use other peoples libraries and code
[22:50:15] <xp_prg> I guess I am lazy
[22:53:02] <eddiemonge> i found most plugins are not well written
[22:53:30] <yamahaalex37> cough*didyoulookatmyplugin?*cough
[22:53:56] <xp_prg> can you recommend any books on good web design/graphics approaches for web development that utilizes more jquery like plugins then photoshop etc...?
[22:55:09] <yamahaalex37> i think you mean css
[22:55:11] <yamahaalex37> not jquery
[22:55:21] <xp_prg> well I mean both :>
[22:55:29] <yamahaalex37> yeah jquery adds a lot of spice
[22:55:43] <yamahaalex37> but css i think can produce something more pleasing than photoshop
[22:56:31] <yamahaalex37> just be a border-radius, box-shadow, text-shadow, gradient whore like me!
[22:56:40] <xp_prg> I have been :>
[22:57:14] <yamahaalex37> i think this looks alright, better than I could do in photoshop, and the only image is the gray fuzzy bg

[22:58:14] <pillar> hi
[22:58:44] <pillar> in jqueryui, i wanna toggle draggable and droppable.
[22:58:48] <pillar> how can i do that?
[22:59:21] <yamahaalex37> make a variable isDraggable = 0 / 1
[22:59:32] <pillar> hm..
[22:59:39] <pillar> what r u meaning?
[22:59:40] <yamahaalex37> and put your drag statements in an if block that says if (isDraggable == 1
[22:59:59] <yamahaalex37> and then however your going to toggle the drag on / off, like with a button
[23:00:14] <yamahaalex37> change the value of isDraggable within that buttons click event function
[23:00:58] <pillar> which function should i call to off draggable?
[23:01:02] <pillar> i cant find this.
[23:01:09] <yamahaalex37> i guess your drag listener will need to be outside of the if (is draggable
[23:01:18] <yamahaalex37> you wont off draggable
[23:01:34] <yamahaalex37> you will change your variable, isDraggable, to 0 or 1
[23:01:44] <pillar> so there is no official api to unset draggable?
[23:01:46] <yamahaalex37> each time the user clicks Turn Draggable On / Off
[23:01:47] <pillar> hm..
[23:01:57] <yamahaalex37> how are you dragging things?
[23:02:08] <pillar> $('.element').draggable()
[23:02:10] <yamahaalex37> just clicking on them and dragging them?
[23:02:44] <pillar> i call this function to make some element draggable.
[23:02:56] <pillar> then... how can i turn off?
[23:03:04] <pillar> this is what i wanna know
[23:03:26] <pillar> as i think
[23:03:34] <yamahaalex37> oh
[23:03:45] <pillar> $('.element').draggable({turn off : yes})
[23:03:49] <pillar> like this...
[23:03:52] <yamahaalex37> .draggable( "destroy" )
[23:04:05] <yamahaalex37> lol turn off yes
[23:04:14] <yamahaalex37> you would think turn off is enough instruction
[23:04:20] <pillar> just example..
[23:04:39] <yamahaalex37> yeah , click Methods, the fourth tab on the right
[23:04:41] <yamahaalex37> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[23:05:08] <pillar> ah.. method!!!
[23:05:18] <pillar> I just found these in options tab!!!
[23:05:27] <pillar> oh.. idiot..
[23:05:31] <pillar> thx
[23:05:37] <yamahaalex37> yeah sorry i was irrelevant for a while, thought draggable was more like a listener
[23:07:30] <pillar> thx yamahaalex37
[23:31:56] <devinrayolsen> got this variable var revisedDate = Dx.setDate(Dx.getDate()+Dy); that I'm trying to write as such: var revisedDate = Dx.setDate(Dx.getDate()[(someCondition)? + : -]Dy); vs. having a long if else condition because of a simple subtraction or addition need.. but fails.. anyone got an idea how to write a ternary operator to  condition the addition or subtraction of two surrounding numbers?
[23:32:51] <mindis|wurk> i hate shorthand comparisons
[23:33:04] <devinrayolsen> but they love you. :)
[23:33:12] <mindis|wurk> no, they really don't
