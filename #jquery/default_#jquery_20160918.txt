[10:01:39] <iamawesome> Hi, when do we need to use jquery?
[10:02:09] <Cthulhux> you never need to
[10:04:58] <iamawesome> Cthulhux: Why does this exist then?
[10:05:07] <Cthulhux> because people are lazy
[10:05:28] <Cthulhux> don't get me wrong, jquery is awesome for what it does. chances are that you won't need a tenth of what it does though
[10:41:14] <puchacz> hi, I am having a problem with nailing down correct event, dom parsed but none of the scripts/images/whatever loaded. I am trying to inject chrome content script run_at:document_start into this page: http://markwadsworth.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/banking-made-easy.html
[10:41:15] <puchacz> then my content script has window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { ...} );
[10:41:17] <puchacz> but it triggers only after this page times out waiting for something: GET http://tags.sharehere.com/4916 net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
[10:41:43] <puchacz> clearly DOM is ready before that
[10:53:16] <puchacz> is there any event that triggers after DOM is parsed but before scripts are executed pls?
[10:53:24] <puchacz> in plain javascript even, without jquery
[14:26:11] <staticsn0w_> hiya
[15:37:02] <jquery192> hi there I'm having a hard time trying to manage the "asynchronicity" of js
[15:37:51] <jquery192> My form has a number of related select fields that load data through ajax calls
[15:39:07] <jquery192> I need to load the form, setting all the fields... but they are not ready when I try to set them....
[15:39:18] <jquery192> what am i missing?
[16:06:25] <Sal> is there a fast way to find the first parent div that has scrolling?
[17:01:42] <Bored> hello, i have div with id and ul li with img. i want to adclas to the first or seond with a function so i do this  function p(id){ $(".flex-control-thumbs li img")[parseInt(id)].addClass("flex-active"); } but it's not working says addClass isn't a function can someone please help me?
[17:25:38] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/q1L9e34b/ <â€” anyone good with multi-part forms?
[20:56:05] <z1haze> anyone alive in here?
[20:56:33] <z1haze> I have a local js object, and an object that i am fetching to the server. My goal is to sync the local object with the values that is returned from the server, i am attempting something like this: http://dpaste.com/30X9J14
[20:56:56] <z1haze> I think the issue that im having is that it isactually looking for the value of server.key rather than the value of what key actually is... that.server is my local instance, and server if the one i just fetched
[21:11:35] <Velveeta> z1haze: do you have a jquery question?
[21:12:07] <z1haze> i just asked it..
[21:12:18] <Velveeta> there's no jquery in the snippet you posted...
[21:12:24] <z1haze> LOL
[21:13:07] <z1haze> nice life.
[21:24:08] <cambazz> hello, i bought a template, and there is this donut plot on it, that begins with ui-jq="plot" ui-options="...
[21:24:38] <cambazz> i am trying to find js documentation on this library, i.e. i need to identify the charting lib on my template
[21:24:59] <cambazz> i am making a donut chart, but on the side it shows "undefined"
[21:28:41] <z1haze> look at the script includes usually templates have each script included individually
[21:28:48] <z1haze> plus typically documentation comes with them too
[21:30:02] <z1haze> quick google search hints it might be flot charts
