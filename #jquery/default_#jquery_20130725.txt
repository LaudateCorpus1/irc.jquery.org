[01:21:42] <omegak> Hi, I'm trying to get jquery-ui sortable containment working with overflow:auto, but I found something that I believe is a bug. I would appreciate if I can get some feedback before I open a ticket. Here in stackoverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838931/jquery-sortable-containment-breaks-when-scrolling) I have the issue fully explained along with a jsfiddle. Thanks!
[01:26:26] <josefrichter> hi guys, I need to open a select menu "remotely" with a button. this code does not work - any hints why, please? http://jsbin.com/ilogup/1/edit
[01:34:50] <[E]sc> ryorky1, event.preventDefault(); should be what you're looking for.

[02:29:29] <activate_> Hey all, trying to get a hover to change a background image. I am not getting an error back on my function but it's also not doing what I intended.
[02:29:52] <activate_> http://jsfiddle.net/2ndRF/ is there anything wrong with the .css line?
[02:32:23] <didiergm> @activate_: have you tried checking that $("a[href="+hashref+"]") selects what you intend ?
[02:32:48] <houdmont> @activate_ I think you need to use single quotes instead of double quotes in your css changing the background image
[02:33:21] <activate_> didiergm: Yes I have tried with console.log and it showed the right anchor
[02:33:30] <houdmont> use 'url(wp-content/themes/mytheme/images/'+myref+'_a.png' instead of your current line of css
[02:33:36] <activate_> houdmont: Let me try that out :)
[02:36:13] <activate_> houdmont: :) Thanks, somehow I was overlooking that constantly :)
[02:36:35] <activate_> Now to just add the 2nd function to handle the mouseout to change the picture back to inactive :)
[02:38:13] <houdmont> awesome, glad to help
[02:39:43] <didiergm> @houdmont cool, I've learnt something today
[02:40:13] <houdmont> easy mistake to make, only reason I spotted it was because I do it all the time myself...
[02:40:27] <didiergm> best way to learn :)

[04:13:26] <ph88> some part of my code is triggering an elemant to go in hide() ... how can i find out what is causing this ?   I already tried setting a breakpoint on before it happens and then use "step into". But that didn't work
[04:13:54] <sammich> anyway to sample?
[04:14:04] <sammich> you don't have any hide code, I presume?

[04:33:42] <Zerhackos> hi there, im using jquerymobile 1.3.2 on a nokia lumina. When opening a panel with relveal/push, the fixed toolbars disappear - the menü button is still clickable. Someone has a idea what to do? jsfiddle needed?
[04:34:07] <sammich> panels push the page off
[04:34:17] <sammich> includes the header/footer
[04:34:35] <sammich> at least, that's what happens on desktop afaik
[04:36:53] <Zerhackos> according to weire, the header is still at the same position. Altought the button is clickable.

[04:37:17] <didiergm_> jq mobile on changePage there is an option changeHash:false is there an equivalent for anchor links ?
[04:40:19] <ph88> something is wrong with this piece of code http://pastebin.com/0cAsLu3y but i can't figure out what .... the transitionend event is still triggered after this piece of code has been completed ... even though it's only a one() event ...
[04:45:16] <ph88> actually ... a 1 time event binds to 3 div's  ... inside this event i want to check for a similar event on one of the div's ... this totally messes things up as i think the initial event is still active ... and thus looping the code ...  What's a better solution ? binding only 2 of the 3 div's in the first place ? or removing the event handler inside the event callback for that 1 particular div ?

[05:48:23] <rets> hi everyone, I cant seem to get my code to send the user to a url
[05:48:35] <rets> http://jsbin.com/opudun/1/
[05:48:57] <rets> as far as I see it, what should happen is that every time the button is clicked (regardless of the other code that goes on in there), the user should be forwarded to disney.com
[05:49:04] <rets> but that doesnt happen, any idea why?
[05:58:20] <rets> anyone?
[06:08:53] <shoky> rets: window.location.replace(...)
[06:11:21] <e01> hello
[06:12:09] <e01> i had and element that is returned with getElementById() in var x, but i wana get it as jQuery object because to apply jquery plugin once(), how can i convert it
[06:12:51] <sammich> $(element)
[06:13:02] <sammich> well, $(x)
[06:13:36] <e01> but with it it return me a array structure
[06:15:41] <EdenK> its return it as object
[06:17:22] <sammich> that's how it kinda works, jquery
[06:17:33] <sammich> just run once() on $(x), you'll live
[06:19:43] <e01> hm seems work, thanks
[06:21:31] <rets> .129) Quit (Client Quit)

[06:21:40] <rets> as far as I see it, what should happen is that every time the button is clicked (regardless of the other code that goes on in there), the user should be forwarded to disney.com
[06:21:43] <rets> but that doesnt happen, any idea why?
[06:22:04] <rets> basically, I want my code to send a user to a url
[06:23:49] <sonOfRa> if I want to delete data that was attached to a dom element with .data(), how do I do this correctly?
[06:24:37] <sammich> you know, the API docs are an excellent resource
[06:25:39] <EdenK> rets, shoky told u change to window.location.replace
[06:26:01] <rets> oh, I missed it
[06:26:01] <rets> thanks
[06:29:43] <sonOfRa> Oh, the removeData is awfully well hidden. Why not a link inside the doc of .data(), like: "use .removeData() to remove data from the object again", that would seem reasonable
[06:30:47] <sammich> depends on your definition of 'well hidden'
[06:42:37] <murr4y> hi, what's the deal with .html() and trimming trailing whitespace - has it been fixed in recent versions?
[07:17:20] <mrHAT> i need a simple way of formatting numbers such as N, N.NN, N.NNN to N.NN €
[07:21:23] <_jo_> I'm looking to attach a function to the modification of a DOM object.  Is $.on('MutationEvent', fooFunction) behave well these days?
[07:21:54] <Famic> mrHAT: try string.toFixed()
[07:22:32] <Famic> _jo_:
[07:22:49] <_jo_> ?
[07:22:57] <_jo_> Sorry, I'm not seeing what you typed.
[07:22:58] <Famic> my pasting is not working ^^
[07:23:02] <_jo_> Ah.  :P
[07:23:14] <mrHAT> Famic : nice
[07:23:29] <Famic> http://caniuse.com/#search=mutation
[07:23:50] <BillCriswell> It's number.toFixed(), so you'd have to do like +string.toFixed(n)
[07:24:23] <_jo_> Neat site.  Thanks!
[07:24:48] <mrHAT> yes bill, i was aware about the sintax
[07:24:53] <Famic> _jo_: one can't do without canisue ;)
[07:25:10] <Famic> mrHAT: I said string instead of number, my bad
[07:25:23] <BillCriswell> That's all I was clarifying on haha.
[07:26:12] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: If you want , in thousands it'll be more complicated, however.
[07:26:20] <someone235> Hey, How can I create an IFRAME that its dimensions fits to its content?
[07:26:37] <mrHAT> i wonder how fast is it
[07:26:48] <BillCriswell> someone235: Is the content on the same domain?
[07:26:57] <BillCriswell> Well, is the iframe src on the same domain.
[07:27:30] <Croves> It's ok to ask for help here about a plugin?
[07:27:53] <someone235> BillCriswell, yes
[07:28:26] <BillCriswell> someone235: You can do $('iframe').contents().find('body').height() and .width() I believe?
[07:28:37] <Croves> I'm using MaskMoney (https://github.com/plentz/jquery-maskmoney) to format my money inputs, but some of this inputs are created dinamically via jQuery. The problem is, when this fields are created, the mask goes crazy and when I insert a value to it, the mask multiply by the number
[07:28:39] <someone235> I'll try
[07:28:40] <BillCriswell> You'd have to do it through Javascript AFAIK.
[07:29:33] <BillCriswell> someone235: I find it really weird that there's no like... height="auto" width="auto" type deal for it.
[07:29:44] <mrHAT> how can i do a wrapper around that toFixed so i can call like this : string.myownfunction()
[07:30:38] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: 23.toFixed(3).myownfunction()
[07:30:47] <BillCriswell> toFixed() returns a string.
[07:32:29] <mrHAT> i want something like function test() { return this.toFixed(2)+' EURO'; }   and do thestring.test();
[07:32:57] <BillCriswell> test( 23 ) then
[07:32:58] <mrHAT> im not sure how that works
[07:33:16] <BillCriswell> Well, test( num ){ return num.toFixed(2) + ' EURO'; }
[07:33:40] <mrHAT> but how are those functions defined exactly
[07:33:50] <mrHAT> those that are called with xxx.funcname()
[07:33:52] <BillCriswell> var test = function( num ){ return num.toFixed(2) + ' EURO'; } would be better probably
[07:34:07] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: Those would be methods.
[07:34:18] <mrHAT> ahh yes damn
[07:34:36] <BillCriswell> You would need to do like String.prototype.test(){ ... }
[07:36:20] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149055/how-can-i-format-numbers-as-money-in-javascript has a bunch of ways to do what you'd like.
[07:42:07] <curtisjester> Does anyone know of a tutorial on how to get some custom js in wordpress?
[07:42:23] <mrHAT> String.prototype.formatPrice = function() { return this.toFixed(2) + ' EURO'; };   somestring.formatPrice; does not drop any errors but it dosent work
[07:44:54] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: If you're not super familiar with Javascript I'd just use the regular function.
[07:45:13] <okt> Anyone have a solution for checking filesize for file attachments? My reading last night described a limitation on accessing the client filesystem, so my understanding it you would have to post the file to the server and wait until it's processed to compare to max size before it can reject the file. I can't see this working for large files, ie > 1GB.
[07:45:32] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: You can't do toFixed() on a string, which is what you're trying to do.
[07:46:13] <mrHAT> ahh damn
[07:47:08] <mrHAT> Number..
[07:47:32] <mrHAT> thanks BillCriswell it's fun to start learning new stuff
[07:47:38] <enginpost> String.prototype.formatPrice = function() { return parseFloat(this).toFixed(2) + ' EURO'; };
[07:48:22] <mrHAT> i just did Number.prototype...
[07:48:37] <mrHAT> since that is the input actually
[07:49:17] <innociv__> ['foo'].splice(0, 1);  why doesn't this remove "foo"?
[07:51:08] <BillCriswell> innociv__: I think you want slice.
[07:51:19] <BillCriswell> splice returns what it removed... I think?
[07:51:19] <innociv__> Same thing
[07:51:47] <innociv__> ?eval
[07:51:54] <someone235> BillCriswell, how?
[07:51:56] <Bloomberg> Good morning guys!!
[07:51:58] <Bloomberg> Nice day!!
[07:52:05] <BillCriswell> innociv__: Sure you don't want slice(1) ?
[07:52:24] <innociv__> oh right
[07:52:28] <innociv__> it needs to be up one higher
[07:52:43] <dcherman2> okt: What browsers are you targeting?
[07:52:47] <Bloomberg> really I don't know why I cannot get the value of a simple input.
[07:52:54] <mrHAT> so BillCriswell bare with me here ... so actually what i did here : Number.prototype.formatPrice = function() { return this.toFixed(2) + ' EURO'; }; was adding a new method to the Number object ?
[07:53:02] <someone235> BillCriswell, how u can do it with JS?
[07:53:26] <`Martin`> guys if i want to trigger a "click" event of an <asp:button runat="server...>  is the Click() method the correct way to do this? it seems that it does client side only
[07:54:20] <Zerhackos> jquerymobile: is there a way to reposition the fixed toolbars on orientationchange back to the page head/foot? Currently they are positioned somewhere random on the page if i tilt my iphone (its working on android and windows phone)
[07:54:52] <BillCriswell> someone235: On the page that holds the iframe do like var $iframe = $('iframe'); $iframeBody = $iframe.contents().find('body'); $iframe.css({ height: $iframeBody.height(), width: $iframeBody.width() });
[07:55:19] <BillCriswell> mrHAT: Yes.
[07:55:40] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/azenox/1/edit
[07:55:43] <Bloomberg> that is my script
[07:56:04] <Bloomberg> Someone could tell me why I cannot get the value of ('input[id="optionname"]').val()
[07:56:09] <Bloomberg> Show me empty
[07:56:22] <Bloomberg> But I don't found the mistake
[07:56:29] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Just do #optionname
[07:56:56] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: There's no value on that field.
[07:57:19] <Bloomberg> I write it when show me that form
[07:57:31] <someone235> BillCriswell, $('iframe').contents().find('body').height() returns 135
[07:57:41] <someone235> while $('iframe').css('height') returns 150
[07:57:55] <BillCriswell> someone235: You might need .outerHeight()?
[07:58:05] <BillCriswell> Either way just play around with those numbers and you should get close.
[07:58:10] <BillCriswell> I never actually tried to do that.
[07:58:33] <someone235> .outerHeight() returns also 135
[07:59:11] <BillCriswell> $('iframe').height() isn't the same as $('iframe').contents().find('body').height()
[07:59:29] <BillCriswell> I'm guessing 150px is the default height for an iframe?
[08:00:02] <BillCriswell> I gave you the code directly, did you try that?
[08:02:17] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/azenox/3/edit
[08:02:34] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: See that plz
[08:03:24] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: It still doesn't have a value. Here it is with it: http://jsbin.com/azenox/4/edit
[08:06:55] <Bloomberg_> BillCriswell: understand what i need?
[08:07:12] <BillCriswell> You want the value from the input I thought?
[08:07:34] <Bloomberg_> yes
[08:08:24] <BillCriswell> Did you see the link I typed above?
[08:08:58] <Bloomberg_> yes
[08:09:14] <Bloomberg_> But I believe you still without understand me,
[08:09:24] <Bloomberg_> the value that the user that fill the form
[08:09:31] <Bloomberg_> a default value not
[08:10:12] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg_: You want the placeholder text?
[08:10:28] <Bloomberg_> no
[08:11:12] <Bloomberg_> For example when you are filling the inputin the form and you write "Something" and then submit  the button alert something, that is the value that you wrote
[08:18:11] <BillCriswell> someone235: If it's on the same domain you can just use a $.get() request.
[08:18:59] <someone235> should it matter?
[08:19:17] <someone235> BillCriswell, I can't
[08:19:36] <someone235> I need it to get its own $_GET
[08:20:44] <someone235> there's an event for when iframe finish to load?
[08:21:53] <BillCriswell> someone235: I'm having mixed results with it.
[08:23:07] <BillCriswell> someone235: You can do $('#someDiv').load('iframe.php?foo=bar body')
[08:23:39] <BillCriswell> That'll load just the body into #someDiv of the iframe.php?foo=bar result.
[08:24:30] <BillCriswell> someone235: http://api.jquery.com/load/

[08:33:20] <DeltaHeavy> Does anybody know how I can get what the value is displayed as (stuff between <option> tags) in a <select>? This is what I have so far: $('#csr_5 > select > option[value="' + $('#csr_5 > select').val() + '"]').html()
[08:34:10] <gnu_d> Hi, what does this $grid = $("#somelement).someMethod(); Does the $ symbol has some meaning, cause I want to make it global, in order to access some methods from it ?
[08:34:48] <gho5t> it indicates that it's a jquery wrapped object
[08:35:42] <gnu_d> gho5t: but how do I manipulate with that object, for instance with what name to use it in order to access some methods or properties out of it ?
[08:35:56] <gho5t> use $
[08:36:39] <gho5t> $.someMethod()
[08:38:06] <gnu_d> gho5t: but $grid is an object.
[08:38:28] <gho5t> didn't realize you meant $grid
[08:38:43] <gho5t> you can use $grid by...using $gird
[08:38:47] <gho5t> *$grid
[08:38:58] <gho5t> $grid.someMethod()
[08:39:20] <gnu_d> gho5t: I tried that, but says it's undefined
[08:39:31] <gho5t> then your method isn't returning anything
[08:39:42] <gho5t> $("#somelement).someMethod()
[08:39:48] <gho5t> is what $grid equals
[08:40:08] <DeltaHeavy> Does anybody know how I can get what the value is displayed as (stuff between <option> tags) in a <select>? This is what I have so far. It works but it seems kinda hacky.
[08:40:09] <DeltaHeavy>  $('#csr_5 > select > option[value="' + $('#csr_5 > select').val() + '"]').html()
[08:40:57] <gnu_d> gho5t: scope problems.
[08:42:01] <enginpost> DeltaHeavy: $("#someList #someOption").text()
[08:42:15] <DeltaHeavy> True, I should just give the options ID's
[08:42:46] <gho5t> gnu_d if you wan to make it global, omit the var before $grid
[08:42:54] <enginpost> DeltaHeavy: whatever you use to select the option is cool. You want to use the .text() method to get the text between the <option>
[08:43:00] <gho5t> but you really should add $grid to a namespace object
[08:43:12] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, thanks!
[08:43:25] <gnu_d> gho5t: do you know the pqgrid plugin ?
[08:43:28] <maxmoore14> anyone pretty good with jqm css? http://jsbin.com/eruwen/1/edit
[08:43:39] <enginpost> gho5t: if you say something like: var myDiv = $("#someDiv");
[08:44:00] <maxmoore14> I'm trying to get a text input inline with a toggle button
[08:44:04] <enginpost> gho5t: don't you still have to wrap that using jQ to get something from it like...
[08:44:21] <enginpost> gh05t: $( myDiv ).html()
[08:44:30] <gho5t> no
[08:44:37] <gho5t> you are already wrapping it in jquery
[08:45:05] <gnu_d> gho5t: I'm just trying to access it's refresh methods :D
[08:45:06] <enginpost> gh05t: so you think he ought to be able to write something like...
[08:45:38] <enginpost> gh05t: var myDiv = $("#someDiv"); alert( myDiv.html() );
[08:45:49] <gho5t> sure
[08:45:55] <enginpost> i thought that would blow up
[08:45:57] <enginpost> hmm
[08:45:58] <enginpost> cool
[08:46:27] <gho5t> enginpost: $("#someDiv").html() works right? so why wouldn't var $foo = $("#someDiv"); $foo.html()
[08:48:49] <enginpost> The "$" is like a reserved alias for "jQuery"
[08:49:18] <enginpost> does the error console tell you something is undefined
[08:49:51] <enginpost> actually, that worked for me
[08:49:52] <enginpost> http://jsfiddle.net/C8u5U/
[08:51:01] <enginpost> the more likely test: http://jsfiddle.net/C8u5U/1/
[08:52:02] <fonko> guys did anybody use iosSlider before? im having a stressing issue with the divs that contains tweets... they overlap and i cant figure out how to fix this, i tried with UL and li elements but they wont move if i try to drag them
[08:53:03] <enginpost> gh05t: could the problem be variable scope? where is $foo defined?
[08:53:15] <gho5t> why are you asking me enginpost
[08:53:33] <enginpost> at 11:46a you asked me a question
[08:53:43] <gho5t> no i didn't
[08:53:47] <gho5t> what was the question
[08:54:06] <enginpost> gh05t: you wrote: enginpost: $("#someDiv").html() works right? so why wouldn't var $foo = $("#someDiv"); $foo.html()
[08:54:10] <gho5t> lol
[08:54:20] <gho5t> that was me explaining my answer to your question
[08:54:23] <enginpost> was that rhetorical?
[08:54:26] <gho5t> yes
[08:54:27] <enginpost> oh
[08:54:28] <enginpost> haha
[08:55:02] <enginpost> my bad
[08:57:15] <fonko> guys did anybody use iosSlider before? im having a stressing issue with the divs that contains tweets... they overlap and i cant figure out how to fix this, i tried with UL and li elements but they wont move if i try to drag them

[09:01:51] <okdamn> can i remove file from input file?
[09:03:16] <gnu_d> okdamn: reset the element or delete the file physically ?
[09:03:27] <okdamn> gnu_d:  reset i mean
[09:03:50] <okdamn> when you choose file from pc on input file somenthing happens i would like to cancel
[09:04:00] <gnu_d> okdamn: try val("")
[09:04:06] <okdamn> gnu_d:  ok
[09:04:49] <BillCriswell> okdamn: I think reset() could work but it'll reset all the fields to their default values. You might need to remove the element and add it again? Not sure.
[09:05:12] <okdamn> uhm probably i can remove it beforesubmit form
[09:05:13] <okdamn> yep
[09:05:15] <okdamn> nice idea
[09:05:26] <okdamn> will be send anyway or not? i f i remove it?
[09:05:34] <okdamn> BillCriswell:
[09:05:58] <okdamn> cause i'm just faking input file but i don't want to send file trough form
[09:06:00] <BillCriswell> If you remove it it should not be sent. I don't know for certain though... Definitely hope so.
[09:06:08] <okdamn> ok )
[09:12:59] <okdamn> you saved my life
[09:12:59] <okdamn> it works
[09:12:59] <okdamn> thanks buddy
[09:13:08] <teethree_> hey guys, quick question
[09:13:30] <teethree_> how would I scroll to an accordion id on a page? ive got one page linking an anchor opening the accordion to the proper tab on the next but the # link doesnt focus to that section, just sits up top
[09:13:40] <teethree_> http://www.aandmgraphics.net/new/ click any of the services under the slider to see example
[09:15:38] <teethree_> anyone? :<
[09:20:47] <BillCriswell> okdamn: Welcome!
[09:23:04] <illmatix> I have jquery ui tabs on my page but after clicking on the tab and getting the ajax content for it. ui-tabs-hide is reapplied to the content panel of the tabs. How can i avoid this since it makes content flash up for a second and hide
[09:24:43] <Quest> is there a way to include header.html and footer.html (any files) in a parent html file by jquery or js?
[09:26:23] <dpy> hi guys
[09:26:34] <dpy> any testswarm gurus aboard?
[09:26:39] <Krinkle> aye
[09:26:45] <dpy> I'm trying to wipe some jobs
[09:26:52] <dpy> but I'm failing miserably here
[09:27:04] <Krinkle> Log in to the web interface and click "Delete job" ?
[09:27:19] <Krinkle> (which version are you running btw)
[09:27:22] <dpy> I don't see delete job?
[09:27:23] <dpy> oh wait
[09:27:32] <Krinkle> the big red button :)
[09:27:33] <dpy> beter get the latest version I guess
[09:27:44] <dpy> this is 1.0.0-alpha
[09:27:45] <Krinkle> dpy: hold your horses
[09:27:51] <dpy> I didn't see anything newer
[09:28:15] <Krinkle> changes within -alpha may not be compatible, there were 2 changes in the last few months that don't have a clean upgrade path. just FYI
[09:28:16] <Krinkle> OK
[09:28:18] <Krinkle> great :)
[09:28:31] <dpy> oh wait
[09:28:33] <dpy> duh
[09:28:40] <dpy> I thought I was logged in
[09:28:42] <dpy> nm
[09:29:02] <dpy> I thought I had to do it using the rest interface
[09:29:11] <dpy> must be the afternoon dip
[09:29:30] <Krinkle> There is an API for it (that's what the web interface uses, too. it's all ajaxy)
[09:29:47] <Quest> is there a way to include header.html and footer.html (any files) in a parent html file by jquery or js?
[09:31:23] <teethree_> need a jQuery guru real quick for a syntax fix, 1 line of code
[09:32:07] <Krinkle> teethree_: don't ask to ask, just ask :)
[09:32:20] <Dorf> i'm trying to change a constant to a variable based on <textarea maxlength="1000"> by var max= $("textarea[maxlength]").  is this possible?
[09:32:45] <teethree_> jQuery('html,body').animate({scrollTop: tab.offset().top});}
[09:32:59] <Krinkle> trailing '}'
[09:33:01] <illmatix> I have jquery ui tabs on my page but after clicking on the tab and getting the ajax content for it. ui-tabs-hide is reapplied to the content panel of the tabs. How can i avoid this since it makes content flash up for a second and hide.
[09:33:52] <teethree_> Krinkle would that work tho or would i have to put ('#" + tab) in there do u think?
[09:34:03] <teethree_> tab is an id number but doesnt have a hashtag onnit
[09:34:31] <Krinkle> thang: I don't see a tab or a has tag in that line, you were talking about a syntax error?
[09:35:11] <Krinkle> teethree_: Is variable 'tab' a string or a jQuery object?
[09:35:16] <Krinkle> tab = 'foo'; // string
[09:35:19] <Krinkle> tab = '#foo'; // string
[09:35:25] <Krinkle> tab = $('#foo'); // object
[09:35:44] <teethree_> var tab = parseInt(index.replace("#",""));
[09:36:08] <Krinkle> teethree_: Where does `index` come from
[09:37:02] <timbozeman> any clue why $('body:not(.not-front').removeClass('front').addClass('not-front'); works in all browsers but chrome?
[09:37:02] <Krinkle> teethree_: (got your message in private), so it comes from user input / e.g. insecure
[09:37:19] <Krinkle> teethree_: In that case, use var $tab = $( document.getElementByid( tab ) );
[09:37:23] <Krinkle> then $tab.offset().top
[09:37:41] <Krinkle> (instead of $tab = $('#' + tab))
[09:39:11] <Quest> is there a way to include header.html and footer.html (any files) in a parent html file by jquery or js?
[09:39:54] <ArxPoetica> do older versions of jquery (1.8.3) have issues with windows 8? or other touch screen windows devices?
[09:41:23] <Krinkle> Quest: Only if the html you include is a valid sub tree
[09:41:59] <Krinkle> e.g. you can't include header.html if that file is like <div id="pagewrap"> and then footer.html like </div><!-- /#pagewrap -->
[09:42:22] <Krinkle> If it is not like that but a valid sub tree, then you can load it with $.ajax(), parse it and prepend/append how you like
[09:42:38] <Krinkle> could even use $.fn.load() to abstract it if that wors
[09:42:39] <Krinkle> works*
[09:43:03] <Krinkle> so $('<div class="header"></div>').load('header.html').prependTo('body');
[09:43:37] <Krinkle> (untested, but something like it)
[09:43:50] <Quest> Krinkle,  ok. how to do that?
[09:44:14] <Krinkle> I just told you. If you can't use that, I think you may have to learn something else first.
[09:44:25] <Quest> Kraytul,  isnt there a way like            import = "header.html"  ?
[09:45:12] <ArxPoetica> bump __> does windows 8 have issues with older versions of jquery (1.8.3)? or other touch screen windows devices?
[09:45:17] <gho5t> yes Quest use that
[09:45:24] <Krinkle> Quest: Why do you want to do this in javascript though? Sounds like you should do this in your server-side skin (e.g. PHP or whatever you have)
[09:53:14] <lugzer> hi
[09:55:52] <lugzer> after looking at jQuery mobile, it seems to me that it's a perfect solution for building a web-based solution which is targeted for mobile devices (acting as if it was a native app) and not really desktop browsers (although it's still going to work fine in desktop browsers).. is this correct more or less?
[09:56:45] <gnu_d> Can someone explain me what do I need to add as an argument to set the getUrl from this plugin's documentation: http://paramquery.com/api#option-dataModel-getUrl ?
[10:07:28] <Setsuna> Hi there, We are looking for a graphics designer for a work, if you are interested pm me, thanks :)
[10:10:32] <gho5t> lugzer: yes but also it's good for phonegap apps

[10:30:57] <guspollos> is there a way to detect if an element is in view?
[10:31:01] <brianV> Hi all. Quick question - is there any way to replicate what the $.parseHTML() function does in 1.4.4? Unfortunately, I'm limited to 1.4.4 for now
[10:31:42] <brianV> guspollos: here's a pure JS solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123999/how-to-tell-if-a-dom-element-is-visible-in-the-current-viewport
[10:34:45] <Quest> Krinkle,  ya. but i dont want to do that on serverside. its easy though

[10:42:56] <naeluh> yo
[10:44:09] <trewd6> hello??
[10:44:17] <trewd6> NoiseEee: can you help
[10:44:18] <dubphil> NoiseEee: the result is not all the text of the spans it is empty when I click on one span
[10:44:56] <NoiseEee> dubphil: i don't understad
[10:45:09] <NoiseEee> dubphil: work on that fiddle and tell me whats not to your liking / whats not working
[10:45:30] <NoiseEee> trewd6: look up the documentation?
[10:45:46] <dubphil> NoiseEee: I want to click on 1 of the span of the list and get the text of this span
[10:45:58] <NoiseEee> dubphil: is that not working correctly in the fiddle I pasted?
[10:46:28] <NoiseEee> dubphil: which is *your* code
[10:46:42] <NoiseEee> dubphil: so your error is elsewhere / look in console / learn to debug
[10:46:52] <dubphil> NoiseEee: yes but my code is not working :) that why I ask
[10:47:09] <NoiseEee> dubphil: you mean your page isnt working with that code?

[10:47:27] <tangorri> hi
[10:48:00] <tangorri> I need to set colors for my combobox / options, is select2 the right plugin ?
[10:48:22] <hye> hi... I have two checkboxes.  both checkboxes are tied to a 'click' function.  when one is checked, i uncheck the other one.  so if you click on one checkbox to check it. i do a .click on the other checkbox to check it if its already checked.  but then the other function runs and unchecks the first check mark i checked... how would i resolve this? with callbacks?
[10:49:26] <alexr2> instead of running a .click on the other checkbox, just do a .prop("checked", true)
[10:49:31] <dubphil> NoiseEee: thanks, so I'm on the good way for you ?
[10:49:50] <NoiseEee> dubphil: your code is working in the fiddle.
[10:49:57] <hye> alexr2 but i need the function to run on the .click method, thats why i invoke .click
[10:50:14] <alexr2> right, keep that function, just when you are unchecking the other one
[10:50:27] <dubphil> NoiseEee: yes but there is not the 'click' event, all the texts of all the spans are in the result
[10:50:28] <alexr2> that's when you should be doing the .prop(
[10:50:35] <alexr2> i guess it should be set to false, not true
[10:50:37] <brianV> How can I append a string of HTML to an element, and get the element to slide open with a slider? I want something like nodes.appendTo($("#node-list")).slideDown(); , but that only works if nodes is a jQuery element, not a string
[10:50:46] <hye> ok ill try
[10:50:48] <hye> thnx
[10:51:21] <NoiseEee> brianV: var nodes = $('<span>'+someString+'</span>')
[10:51:41] <brianV> NoiseEee: yep, sometimes I can't see the forest for the trees
[10:51:55] <brianV> NoiseEee: thanks ;)
[10:52:02] <NoiseEee> brianV:  ;)
[10:56:15] <negev> hi, are there any jquery plugins or widgets that work similar to the im chat windows in gmail?  i.e. let you dynamically add text to a div, grow upwards to a certain max height and support scrolling?
[10:56:21] <negev> i've struggled to implement this myself
[10:59:42] <josefrichter> hi could you please recommend plugins/libraries for mobile swipe carousel and for mobile photo galleries (both iOS style)? Thanks
[10:59:58] <connor_> Hello do you want a penis?
[11:01:24] <dubphil> NoiseEee: no error in the firebug console, the fiddle just show all the texts, how can I test the click event in fiddle ?
[11:01:56] <NoiseEee> dubphil: click the things in the lower right pane.
[11:02:45] <dubphil> NoiseEee: ok ! thanks a lot !
[11:05:54] <Kraytul> Quest: haha, Krinkle and I are both tabcompletes for Kr :P
[11:06:32] <Krinkle> Kraytul: yeah, I get that a lot. Usually with "Krenair" (someone how is in a lot of channel I'm in, though not this channel)
[11:06:38] <Krinkle> who*
[11:08:55] <trewd6> NoiseEee: documentation doesn't really say much about this
[11:08:56] <Kraytul> I was like "I haven't been in #jquery in days... why am I tagged in there?"
[11:09:37] <NoiseEee> trewd6: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate
[11:12:19] <trewd6> NoiseEee: Is there a way to set the default date of datepicker to what the end user selects? For example, a users picks May 2014 on the calendar, and then that is set as the default date
[11:12:55] <NoiseEee> trewd6: i haven't worked with it, but isnt' that the method i linked?
[11:13:01] <NoiseEee> you know, SET DATE
[11:13:16] <NoiseEee> store the 'picked' date in a variable, and then SET THE DATE to that?
[11:13:22] <trewd6> NoiseEee: it doesn't work on month/year for some reason
[11:13:39] <utroda> Anyone good with regex?
[11:23:04] <BillCriswell> utroda: What's the issue?
[11:23:12] <BillCriswell> Hopefully I can help you avoid using one. =)
[11:24:06] <brianV> NoiseEee: For a round two - any idea why the .slideDown() in this jsfiddle doesn't work under jQuery 1.4.4, but does under later versions? http://jsfiddle.net/3gTVv/1/
[11:27:29] <NoiseEee> brianV: seems to work with 1.4.2 http://jsfiddle.net/3gTVv/3/
[11:32:58] <brianV> NoiseEee: oh, if you select 'No Library', it uses 1.4.2?
[11:33:32] <NoiseEee> brianV: i added it under 'external resources' on the left
[11:33:51] <brianV> NoiseEee: oh, I didn't know you could do that
[11:34:48] <brianV> NoiseEee: than I'm stymied. On my dev example, it doesn't work under 1.4.4, yet I change the jQuery version to 1.7.1 and it works fine
[11:35:09] <NoiseEee> brianV: nothing in console?
[11:35:38] <brianV> NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS: Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMWindow.getComputedStyle]
[11:35:43] <brianV> NoiseEee: that's the console error
[11:37:34] <NoiseEee> brianV: with the exact code thats there in jsfiddle / no more / no less?
[11:37:59] <brianV> NoiseEee: other than the contained HTML, yes
[11:38:26] <NoiseEee> brianV: maybe http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/780 but i dunno tbh
[11:38:52] <NoiseEee> or google that error msg
[11:38:59] <brianV> NoiseEee: the actual HTML I am inserting is here: http://pastebin.com/yEghzKUP
[11:39:29] <brianV> NoiseEee: googling it was the first thing I did. Google results always point back to the source HTML is bad... but I can't figure out why that's varying betten jQuery versions for me
[11:40:27] <brianV> NoiseEE - this bug looks related actually
[11:40:40] <caitp> is it possible to write non-flaky XHR tests?
[11:40:50] <caitp> i'm trying to accomplish this without waiting N millis
[11:41:37] <brianV> NoiseEee: or not related. While I am using .html(), I am using it to get HTML, not set HTML
[11:44:06] <NoiseEee> brianV: sorry, dunno :|
[11:48:46] <brianV> NoiseEee: this looks like the bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2528
[11:49:17] <utroda> BillCriswell: http://regexr.com?35neb need to match all three lines, so far i can only match one
[11:53:57] <BillCriswell> utroda: This looks very array-like.. You're not dealing with arrays?
[11:54:57] <okt> How are max file sizes handled with posting an ajax request, my understanding is that you would have to wait for the file to show up on the server side to compare. However for a large file that seems like it could end up being a huge waste of time/resources.
[11:56:21] <BillCriswell> utroda: \[(("([a-zA-Z-]+\s[0-9:]+\s(AM|PM)\s-\s[0-9:]+\s(AM|PM))"),?){1,}\] with "multiline" works
[11:56:40] <BillCriswell> utroda: http://gskinner.com/RegExr/?35neh
[11:57:06] <utroda> BillCriswell: its stored in the database like that, we are using a template language to render it. The thing is time is only one example, it might not always be time with AM|PM etc.
[11:57:34] <NoiseEee> brianV: also, not probably the answer you want to hear, but jquery 1.4.x is REALLY old.
[11:58:13] <brianV> NoiseEee: oh, I'm aware. Unfortunately, it's the version still distributed with Drupal 7
[11:58:26] <NoiseEee> brianV: double awesome. good luck :)
[11:58:35] <BillCriswell> utroda: \[(("([a-zA-Z-]+\s[0-9:]+(\s(AM|PM))?\s-\s[0-9:]+(\s(AM|PM))?)"),?){1,}\] would make the AM|PM optional
[11:58:49] <brianV> NoiseEee: double unfortunately, updating to jQuery 1.8.2 broke a lot of stuff ;)
[11:58:52] <BillCriswell> i'd try to test it in that regex test thingamajig but i can't change the test.
[12:02:30] <utroda> BillCriswell: Take a look at this, http://regexr.com?35nek i need it to also work for the foo,bar,baz example, and remove the " from the string
[12:04:54] <BillCriswell> utroda: Could you just match everything between a [ and ] ?
[12:05:10] <c00kiemon5ter> hey people o/
[12:05:56] <c00kiemon5ter> if I have a <div id="content"> how can I style it with height equal to the window height ?
[12:06:06] <c00kiemon5ter> I know how to do it once, but how do I keep updating it ?
[12:06:07] <BillCriswell> utroda: \[[^\]]+\] like this?
[12:06:35] <utroda> it needs to be a replace not a match
[12:07:15] <BillCriswell> utroda: Do they need to be replaced individually?
[12:07:35] <utroda> not sure what you mean
[12:08:23] <utroda> we are using tempojs - and they have a replace function
[12:08:35] <utroda> {{ field | replace 'regex_pattern', 'replacement' }}
[12:08:35] <utroda> Replace all occurrences of the pattern (supports regular expressions) with the replacement. Replacement string can contain backreferences.
[12:09:45] <guspollos> is it possible to do this fade without jquery? http://www.mixd.co.uk/approach/
[12:10:39] <Quest> if i have jquery 1.10.2 but use jquery UI 1.10.3 . will that be ok?
[12:11:09] <BillCriswell> utroda: \[(([^\,]+),?){1,}\] would that work?
[12:11:25] <BillCriswell> I love writting regular expressions, hate using them.
[12:12:13] <DarkGhost`> var noSurvey = [18, 9, 17, 2, 7];            alert(jQuery.inArray($(this).val(),noSurvey)); why is this always reproducing -1?
[12:12:20] <utroda> BillCriswell: doesn't look like its working correctly, its only returning baz. - http://regexr.com?35neq
[12:12:30] <utroda> Thx for the help so far regex is over my head
[12:12:53] <onethfour> regexbuddy is a nice tool, i just purchased mine
[12:13:33] <utroda> onethfour: i'm on a mac
[12:14:18] <BillCriswell> I came across this yesterday, though it was a fun idea: https://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions
[12:15:13] <utroda> yeah thats a neat concept
[12:15:20] <DarkGhost`> var noSurvey = [18, 9, 17, 2, 7];            alert(jQuery.inArray($(this).val(),noSurvey)); why is this always reproducing -1? when .val() is 7
[12:15:43] <DarkGhost`> but if i put quotes around the numbers
[12:15:46] <DarkGhost`> it works, why?
[12:16:13] <Quest> if i have jquery 1.10.2 but use jquery UI 1.10.3 . will that be ok?
[12:16:43] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: Try +$(this).val()
[12:16:49] <BillCriswell> Thinking it's using a strict comparison
[12:17:04] <BillCriswell> $.inArray( '3', [1,4,3]) -> -1
[12:17:10] <BillCriswell> $.inArray( 3, [1,4,3]) -> 2
[12:17:36] <DarkGhost`> + makes it an int? or?
[12:18:25] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: Yes.
[12:18:53] <DarkGhost`> what exactly does + do is it same as pasreInt?>
[12:19:36] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost`: Yeah... or close to it... don't know the details really.
[12:19:45] <BillCriswell> don't know the difference*
[12:20:54] <utroda> BillCriswell: This is as closes as i have gotten, just the [ and ] are left, any ideas? http://regexr.com?35net
[12:22:39] <illmat> Hey guys. Can someone tell me why the animation stops at the half, when the ape is returning to the start? http://jsfiddle.net/UnqUK/
[12:22:40] <dblosevn> Hey guys quick question beating ym brains here on why this wont work, http://dblosevn.chosd.com/179 Ive tried this 2 different ways and neither seem to work...
[12:25:16] <LindsayMac> figured I would share this link.. its an amazing interactive music video with all HTML5 fun .. http://thewildernessdowntown.com/
[12:27:00] <blindMoe> illmat: Looks like it has something to do with your .toggleClass() calls ... if you comment them out the animation does what you would expect
[12:27:15] <blindMoe> illmat: http://jsfiddle.net/UnqUK/1/
[12:27:44] <blindMoe> illmat: sorry wrong link: http://jsfiddle.net/UnqUK/2/
[12:28:52] <illmat> yeah, i wish i could rotateY the image when it arives the item ;\
[12:29:04] <blindMoe> I would try with jQuery instead of css transitions
[12:29:10] <illmat> something transition related i guess
[12:29:29] <blindMoe> yeah I am guessing the browser is making adjustments that are screwing with jQuery
[12:29:50] <blindMoe> illmat: definitely fix the queueing while you are in there... if you hit the button a few times it gets all wonky
[12:30:15] <illmat> buy disabling the button?
[12:30:23] <illmat> *by
[12:31:33] <blindMoe> nah just not allowing it to queue up all the animations
[12:32:02] <blindMoe> illmat: http://api.jquery.com/animate/  look at the 'queue' option
[12:34:00] <illmat> ty
[12:34:04] <BillCriswell> utroda: \[(((\"[^"]+\"),?){1,})\] maybe?
[12:35:38] <BillCriswell> utroda: You're trying to get the lines as a whole right? not 10 different matches?
[12:35:49] <utroda> Yes
[12:36:24] <BillCriswell> Ok cool my last one should work then
[12:36:58] <utroda> Its close but it doesn't remove the "
[12:38:02] <BillCriswell> so the ones in the middle are fine but not the ones on the end?
[12:39:04] <utroda> No " and no [ or ]
[12:39:07] <utroda> is the goal
[12:41:05] <BillCriswell> So the first line shoudl result in: Mon-Sat 04:00 PM - 02:00 AM,Sun 04:00 PM - 01:00 AM,Sat 04:00 PM - 01:00 AM as ONE match?
[12:41:15] <utroda> Yes
[12:42:03] <BillCriswell> Not sure if that'll work?
[12:43:36] <Dinho> someone could tell me why my code works here but when I put in php? http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/UExYN/11/
[12:44:21] <utroda> I sure hope there is
[12:44:44] <utroda> i will keep battling away and let you know if i come up with anything.
[12:45:10] <Dinho> here in line     $('input[value="<?php echo $'+name+'nome_1; ?>"]',li).attr('value','<?php echo $'+name+'nome_'+(ol.find('li').size()+1)+'; ?>')
[12:46:08] <Dinho> here works fine http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/UExYN/11/  when I put in the header does not work
[12:46:22] <Dinho> erro in jquery, ?
[12:46:39] <Dinho> php sintax error
[12:49:23] <Quest> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#fillspace           id="accordion-resizer"    , what if i have many more such accordians?   theres only one id available for me. ?
[12:51:13] <BillCriswell> utroda: http://jsbin.com/ixubem/1/edit does this help?
[12:54:54] <oddover> hi all. can someone take a look at this issue, and tell me if it's a bug or what? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10574365/serializing-textarea-with-wrap-hard-doesnt-give-line-breaks
[13:01:46] <BillCriswell> oddover: The only thing I can think of is removing the wrap="hard" right after submission, use serializeArray() then apply wrap="hard" again?
[13:02:26] <BillCriswell> Well, right before submission technically
[13:07:35] <BillCriswell> oddover: Actually.. not sure I even understand what hard does.
[13:08:01] <BillCriswell> oddover: http://jsfiddle.net/gTWhC/4/ here is what I was testing with, though.
[13:09:41] <dblosevn> Anybody got any ideas on what im missing to get my script working? Ive been over an dover it and I cant see what it is i am doing worng
[13:10:31] <Dinho> deub san!
[13:10:38] <Dinho> debug san
[13:11:59] <shoky> `demo @ dblosevn
[13:11:59] <b-ot> dblosevn: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:12:42] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: Might want to look into $.getScript() ?
[13:14:16] <shoky> Quest: that's just the id they chose in the html. you can do whatever you want to the accordion's container
[13:15:36] <oddover> BillCriswell: this is a better test: http://jsfiddle.net/gTWhC/6/
[13:16:01] <oddover> BillCriswell: Basically, if your text wraps around (autowrap, not manual), it should send the wrap.
[13:17:55] <dblosevn> shoky: [15:22] <dblosevn> Hey guys quick question beating ym brains here on why this wont work, http://dblosevn.chosd.com/179 Ive tried this 2 different ways and neither seem to work...
[13:18:23] <dblosevn> BillCriswell: thats the first thing I tried
[13:19:13] <Quest> whats wrong with the icons in this  http://pastebin.com/RTJwCRXZ
[13:19:14] <Quest> ?
[13:19:32] <BillCriswell> oddover: So if I make the text area smaller and wider the line breaks should reflect what it looks like on the screen?
[13:19:33] <dblosevn> oh oops I didnt include that example
[13:19:44] <shoky> Quest: the semicolon
[13:19:56] <Quest> doesnt works even if iremove it
[13:20:05] <NoiseEee> Quest: putting stuff on pastebin is of zero help.  use jsfiddle.
[13:20:17] <Quest> ok
[13:20:56] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/180 thats the other way I tried it
[13:22:49] <Quest> shoky,  NoiseEee  http://jsfiddle.net/V889z/
[13:24:30] <dblosevn> the callback for getScript is never fired and the code in the script never executed
[13:24:30] <NoiseEee> Quest: and your question is
[13:25:00] <oddover> BillCriswell: as I understand it, yes
[13:25:38] <shoky> Quest: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[13:25:41] <Quest> NoiseEee,  shoky  as soon as i add icons:icons and the ui icons. shows only plain text. no jquery effects
[13:26:01] <oddover> BillCriswell: Check out this to get a feel for it: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_textarea_wrap
[13:27:10] <shoky> Quest: stop nesting $(function() { ... })  inside one another.. you don't need more than one
[13:27:42] <Quest> oh
[13:28:34] <dblosevn> and I tried using $.get and alerting the response and it alerts the code
[13:28:36] <BillCriswell> oddover: I'm not sure what happens there.
[13:28:37] <dblosevn> so im stuck
[13:28:58] <BillCriswell> the dom elements value doesn't even have it
[13:29:14] <Dinho> http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/UExYN/12/     error   Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting ',' or ';' in
[13:29:37] <Dinho> work in jsfiddle
[13:30:54] <BillCriswell> oddover: Trying to think of when this would even be useful.
[13:32:35] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ever hear of wrap="hard" on a textarea?
[13:32:56] <BillCriswell> Been doing this for a long time and I never even heard of it lol
[13:33:28] <Quest> shoky,  NoiseEee  this works now. but messes up the scroll bar when i click on some headings and get back to a long text container. http://jsfiddle.net/V889z/2/
[13:34:12] <shoky> BillCriswell: nope don't think i knew about tha tone
[13:34:14] <shoky> that one
[13:35:13] <oddover> BillCriswell: it's useful in case you want to reformat the auto-word-wrapped user input into a manually word-wrapped text block
[13:35:22] <Quest> shoky,  NoiseEee  whats really wrong?
[13:35:35] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_textarea_wrap it puts line breaks in the value of the textarea where the lines break visually... so hwne you resize the textarea you get different line breaks at different points.
[13:36:09] <shoky> Quest: seems ok to me
[13:36:22] <BillCriswell> oddover: Never had a reason for this really.
[13:36:27] <BillCriswell> a reason to use this*
[13:36:38] <Quest> when I return from another container. the scroll bar is gone
[13:37:32] <BillCriswell> I haven't felt this weird since I learned about indeterminate checkboxes.
[13:37:48] <Quest> shoky,  do you have any clue
[13:38:08] <shoky> Quest: didn't understand the problem
[13:38:38] <okt> if (!inputVal == '') { ... }    Is this appropriate for testing for an unset value from an input?
[13:39:06] <Quest> shoky,  the top most container has long text. at load it shows the scrol bars. i click the second. then click the top most again. the scroll bar for the top one is gone.
[13:40:18] <shoky> Quest: i don't see a scrollbar for the first container, on load
[13:40:38] <Quest> shoky,  you havnt added the jquery ui. thats why
[13:40:46] <shoky> sure i did..
[13:41:12] <shoky> Quest: btw this is how you make a proper fiddle  http://jsfiddle.net/V889z/3/
[13:41:17] <BillCriswell> oddover: I see no way to get the value that's sent to the server.
[13:41:29] <oddover> hmm. ok
[13:42:32] <Quest> shoky,  ok. where did the scrol bars go?
[13:42:58] <BillCriswell> oddover: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4719777/finding-line-breaks-in-textarea-that-is-word-wrapping-arabic-text seems like the closest thing?
[13:43:01] <Quest> shoky,  http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#fillspace
[13:43:15] <Quest> shoky,  and http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#custom-icons
[13:43:25] <shoky> Quest: you didn't follow the example exactly
[13:43:30] <guspollos> is there anywaty to make this scroll faster? http://uexel.us/themes/purity/onepage/wide/
[13:43:47] <shoky> Quest: your fiddle doesn't have a set width/height for the container
[13:44:21] <shoky> Quest: so it just stretches to fit the contents. so no scrollbars
[13:44:23] <Quest> shoky,  which container?
[13:44:31] <shoky> Quest: .accordion-resizer
[13:45:13] <Quest>  $( ".accordion-resizer" ).resizable({
[13:45:13] <Quest>       minHeight: 140,
[13:45:13] <Quest>       minWidth: 200,
[13:45:16] <Quest> they have
[13:45:34] <shoky> that's not a set width/height
[13:46:00] <shoky> it's just a lower limit for the resizable
[13:46:35] <shoky> Quest: no need to PM
[13:46:44] <Quest> it was a long paste
[13:47:52] <Quest> shoky,  http://jsfiddle.net/V889z/5/
[13:48:12] <shoky> Quest: ok, there's a scrollbar
[13:48:15] <keebler> .on("pagebeforeshow"), show causes multiple firings if used in conjunction with the back button, however, preventDefault, and stopProp do not help.
[13:48:21] <shoky> though that size is pretty small.
[13:48:41] <Quest> shoelessone,  i wonder why its not working on my browser
[13:48:58] <shoky> Quest: what browser is that
[13:49:23] <Quest> both were opened by chrome. jsfiddle and my file
[13:49:50] <shoky> Quest: here it is with a normal size.. http://jsfiddle.net/V889z/6/
[13:50:37] <dblosevn> wow 3 hours over a missing ' lmao it was loading the script the whole time just wasnt showing the syntax error in the script
[13:50:53] <Quest> shoky,  i really cant figure out why its not working. may be iam using the latest jquery core?
[13:50:55] <Quest> http://jsfiddle.net/V889z/7/
[13:51:17] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/181
[13:51:19] <shoky> Quest: fiddle works fine, donno what yer talking about
[13:51:24] <Quest> shoky,  its working on jsfiddle. but not on my file. the only difference is jquery version
[13:52:08] <shoky> Quest: i doubt it's the version, if you're using 1.10.2
[13:52:34] <dblosevn> is it a bad idea to extend an object from within a method in the object?
[13:52:34] <shoky> Quest: check your console
[13:53:21] <Quest> shoky,  no errors in console
[13:53:32] <guspollos> what's your first impresison of this site? http://www.sitediscount.ru/scrollstrap/index.html
[13:54:00] <Quest> shoky,  the scrollers re appear when i resize the main container though
[13:54:27] <shoky> Quest: i can't help with a problem i can't see, sry
[13:54:58] <Quest> a minute
[13:55:46] <dblosevn> heres a little more clear example of what im asking about, http://dblosevn.chosd.com/182
[13:58:53] <Quest> shoky,  this is a simple click and open file.    boards.html.    http://alpinema.com/jquery/jquery.tar.gz
[13:59:08] <Quest> shoky,  iam really curious what could possible go wrong.
[14:00:20] <Dinho> guys I have a big problem my code works in jsFiddle but not working in php file because syntax and can not find the error    http://jsfiddle.net/dinho/UExYN/11/
[14:01:05] <shoky> Quest: that's working fine for me, like the fiddle
[14:02:31] <Quest> shoky,  click on warning......    then click again on  terms and conditions.    doesnt the scroll bar goes off of terms and condi..... ?
[14:03:15] <Quest> shoky,  ah..... broswer problem. i though jquery was cross browser imune
[14:03:23] <Quest> this kept me made for some time
[14:03:54] <Dinho> bu in php sintax erro in   $('input[value="<?php echo $'+name+'nome_1; ?>"]',li).attr('value','<?php echo $'+name+'nome_'+(ol.find('li').size()+1)+'; ?>')
[14:03:55] <shoky> Quest: no idea what yer talking about
[14:03:55] <Quest> shoky,  thanks !!
[14:04:12] <Quest> shoky,  working in firefox. not working in chrome
[14:04:15] <Quest> strange
[14:04:53] <Dinho> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting ',' or ';' in  php file

[14:06:01] <Dinho> I run my jquery in php file, when the fiddle testo works when I put in my php file does not work.
[14:06:15] <Quest> shoky,  but it should have worked though
[14:08:15] <NoiseEee> `debug @ Dinho
[14:08:23] <dblosevn> im thinking that I would get an error on line 5 that this.extended is undefined as this refers to the old app object
[14:08:25] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ Dinho
[14:11:59] <andreros> How do I create an object that behaves like a jQuery.Deferred?
[14:12:22] <FrEaKmAn_> when I'm using jquerymobile and I try to get width/height of the image, I get totally wrong data
[14:12:38] <andreros> I've tried Obj.prototype = $.Deferred(), but then multiple instances of Obj get the same $.Deferred()
[14:12:39] <FrEaKmAn_> is $(img).width() and $(img).height() the right approach?
[14:13:22] <andreros> so that obj1.done.test = "TEST"; also makes obj2.done.test change
[14:17:08] <BillCriswell> FrEaKmAn_: You have to make sure they're loaded before you check their width.
[14:17:43] <Erol_> BillCriswell, before loaded.. how?
[14:17:54] <Erol_> I assign src on load
[14:18:35] <BillCriswell> $(window).load(function(){  }); should do it.. I tink
[14:52:38] <Quest> I am really unable to find a thing I saw once. I a div with semi transparent background but the background color was also blurred (made the back background picture blurred a bit)  Where can I get it?
[14:56:35] <Bloomberg> how can I to pass more than one value with  ::  onClick="newloceducation('university','some')"
[15:00:57] <illmat> hey, what's the advantage of putting mod oder com assets in /media?
[15:05:29] <delinquentme> (function ( $ ){ })( jQuery );
[15:05:45] <delinquentme> wat iz dis?
[15:06:08] <delinquentme> theres a bunch of code betwee {}
[15:07:12] <dblosevn> delinquentme: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[15:18:19] <delinquentme> dblosevn, THANKS :D
[15:18:30] <dblosevn> np
[15:18:54] <JFranks> Anyone seen any good easing trickery for JQuery/JS that acts 'magnetic'? .. I'd love a lib where I can assign elements a value of 'magnetism' and then dynamically adjust it..  ie: if you had a series of 'nail.png' <img> elements with a magnetism of "1.0" and then you scattered them all over the page putting a 'magnet.png' in the middle of the page, and then increased the magnetism value of the middle element it would 'pull'/'move' the nearest
[15:18:55] <JFranks> elements, and as you keep increasing the value it would pull in all the elements?
[15:22:01] <boytoy_> JFranks: maybe you can find something in the D3 lib
[15:22:42] <boytoy_> the thing can even emulate little sperm cells swimming around
[15:23:23] <boytoy_> http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1136236
[15:26:30] <JFranks> Yeah.. I was hoping for something a lot less particle physics and more browser dom. ;)
[15:26:37] <JFranks> But neat stuff none the less.. ;)
[15:27:56] <boytoy_> found D3 "Magnets" http://bl.ocks.org/nathanhammond/2010148 though
[15:28:05] <marcules> Good evening
[15:29:33] <boytoy_> JFranks: here we go http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1073373
[15:29:44] <boytoy_> https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Force-Layout#wiki-linkDistance
[15:33:17] <JFranks> Hmmm the ones that say "magnet" are more "elastics"? Still plenty of stuff to look over! Thanks!
[15:43:48] <c00kiemon5ter> if I want to get the size of the visible window, how do I do that?
[15:49:39] <cronin> $(window).width(), $(window).height()
[15:49:58] <c00kiemon5ter> yeah, this doesnt seem to work right for this page :/
[15:50:30] <c00kiemon5ter> $(window).height()
[15:50:30] <c00kiemon5ter> 1220
[15:50:33] <c00kiemon5ter> $(document).scrollTop(700)
[15:50:42] <c00kiemon5ter> <I'm on the end of the page already>
[15:51:50] <c00kiemon5ter> what could be causing that ?
[15:52:51] <cronin> what's $(document).height()
[15:53:07] <c00kiemon5ter> same
[15:53:09] <c00kiemon5ter> 1220
[15:53:36] <cronin> and $('body').height()
[15:53:52] <c00kiemon5ter> 583
[15:54:09] <cronin> well that's why then. you've scrolled beyond the height of the content
[15:56:05] <c00kiemon5ter> how did I do that ?
[15:57:41] <cronin> maybe i don't understand what you're saying. But it sounds like the content of your site is 583 pixels in height. Your browser window is at 1220. So there's nothing to scroll to after 583 pixels.
[16:04:29] <c00kiemon5ter> mmm, no, here's what I do. I'm viewing a website, two different pages on the same browser, different tabs. Inspector is open on both, with the same height. On the one tab I get $(window).height() 605 (which is correct according to the rulers) and on the other 1035 (or 1220 that other page we were talking above)
[16:05:42] <cronin> c00kiemon5ter: is this live?
[16:06:20] <c00kiemon5ter> it is
[16:18:53] <markalanevans> If i want laravel to load an index.html file can i do that?
[16:19:08] <markalanevans> i'm trying to combine  angularjs + laravel & use grunt
[16:19:30] <markalanevans> grunt compiles my js and then generates my html file.
[16:19:44] <markalanevans> yikes wrong chat
[16:32:14] <c00kiemon5ter> alright, so the next step is to move a node to a more proper place :D
[16:50:45] <c00kiemon5ter> bah, moving the node does not fix the reported window height :/
[17:10:41] <__machine> using jquery, how can i determine if an element has a width defined in css (from a class or id selector, not inline on the element)? will css('width') give me width defined on a class? or only inline on the element?
[17:11:23] <eddiemonge> it will give you the width of the element
[17:12:13] <__machine> is there another way i can find out if any of the classes on the element define a width?
[17:15:29] <eddiemonge> __machine: why do you need to know that?
[17:17:26] <__machine> im using select2 to style select elements... im applying it to elements that dont define a width (size is determined by the select lists content) and also elements that have a fixed width... select2 has an option to detect the size of an element or not... detecting works when i have a fixed width but it doesnt when theres no width defined...
[17:17:44] <__machine> so i want to initialise select2 with different options depending on whether or not the element has a width defined
[17:17:46] <c00kiemon5ter> classes = $('element').attr('class'); if (classes) classes.each(function(){ if ($(this).attr('width')) console.log("class defines width"); })
[17:17:53] <c00kiemon5ter> or something like that I guess :P
[17:18:46] <__machine> you can access attributes of css classes like that?
[17:19:27] <c00kiemon5ter> play with it on your browser's console
[17:19:32] <c00kiemon5ter> look at the jquery API
[17:24:32] <__machine> im pretty sure that doesnt work... classes is just a string of class names...
[17:29:26] <eddiemonge> or you could just do $(element).width()
[17:34:28] <J_Caselles> Hello all fellows. I'm seeking for help. I have this jquery code that hides/shows and animates some elements. At first it runs nice, but at exactly 3 runs of hide show (using links) it starts acting erroneously, one thing won't hide any more, the other shows and desapear... This is my code: http://www.fpaste.org/28005/
[17:34:58] <J_Caselles> if anybody could give me a hint about where am I wrong, it would be very much appreciated. Thanks!
[17:46:16] <eddiemonge> J_Caselles: maybe .stop(true, true)?
[17:48:26] <savid> I have a challenge. I want to get the line number in a textarea at the position that the textarea is scrolled to.  I also want this to take wrapping into account -- so one line is everything up to a newline character.  Is this possible?
[17:48:55] <Toerkeium> hello guys
[17:49:19] <eddiemonge> savid: .split('\n').length
[17:49:19] <J_Caselles> eddiemonge: I'm reading about it, and seems like the solution. Thanks! I'll tell you if it works :)
[17:49:28] <eddiemonge> dont know about the where the area is scrolled to though
[17:50:12] <savid> eddiemonge, yeah but once I have the number of lines, then what?  How do I get the line number at the point that the textarea is scrolled to?
[17:50:41] <eddiemonge> see my last message
[17:51:01] <f0ster> I cant' figure out how to append text to a select element in my html, in ie8, https://gist.github.com/f0ster/67e0c9a9d8f3eb2cfd52, any suggestiosn?
[17:51:12] <Toerkeium> I''m having a strange issue. I'm developing an app which has lots of jquery, and now I'm trying to include some scripts for a multi file upload, which should be placed into a jquery tab. The only way I was able to make it work inside the jquery tab was including the scripts "<script>script here</script>at the initial page load, and also in the jquery tab code, using $.getScript. There is something I'm not really getting
[17:51:42] <f0ster> I also tried.. var x = $('<option></option>').attr('value',value).text(copy); $('selector').append( x );
[17:53:19] <Andyyy> Hope it's ok if I ask a question...
[17:53:53] <Andyyy> Please help me if you possible. I'm trying to use the fancybox plugin.  It works as I want it to on this page: http://nolabyg.com/g/test.html  but as soon as I add some more html (See screenshot) the links go inactive as seen in testb.html
[17:53:56] <jaequery> got a rather dumb question
[17:54:07] <Andyyy> Screen Shot of added Code: http://nolabyg.com/g/ss.png  What the added code does to the page: http://nolabyg.com/g/testb.html  ------  Any idea what may be going on?
[17:54:23] <Toerkeium> anyone?
[17:56:00] <jaequery> i have a td row with an onclick bind which toggles a hidden div, and has an e.preventDefault(). but when clicked on a hyperlink that's inside the div, i just want it to open a link, instead of the bind being activated. how to do so?
[17:58:54] <f0ster> does anyone know how to get around this ?? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1641
[17:59:28] <jaequery> is today an off day or what
[17:59:33] <jaequery> where is everybody :S
[17:59:56] <c00kiemon5ter> "Resolution set to wontfix" hoho

[18:11:34] <__machine> anyone familiar with select2? doesnt work with resolve or element width on select lists with no width... and copy doesnt work on select lists with a width defined in a css class (not inline on the element)... http://jsfiddle.net/mrmachine/346xH/1/
[18:27:03] <Weezey> trying to use twitter bootstrap's typeahead but my function doesn't appear to be firing
[18:27:16] <Weezey> no errors on errorconsole
[19:06:09] <nesoi> so anyone here use JQM?
[19:06:20] <nesoi> and furthermore, anyone here use a lazy loader for lists?
[19:07:53] <Tengfei> you can use jquery plugins
[19:11:56] <horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/559/ how can I stop previous on DIV1?
[19:12:24] <horacsio> anyone?
[19:14:05] <horacsio> Cromulent: http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/559/ how can I stop previous on DIV1?
[19:15:32] <horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/559/ how can I stop previous on DIV1?
[19:17:05] <nesoi> Tengfei:  cool… any lazy loading reverse scroll jquery plugins that are good?? :)
[19:20:09] <horacsio> hey nesoi could you help me please?
[19:20:13] <horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/559/ how can I stop previous on DIV1?
[19:21:01] <nesoi> horacsio:  I am a novice too but what are you trying to do?
[19:21:22] <horacsio> go to the link and you'll get the idea :D
[19:22:45] <horacsio> did you get it?
[19:22:58] <nesoi> well you have two global assigments of the same variable
[19:23:09] <nesoi> that won't work
[19:23:37] <nesoi> if you want to reset currentDiv, it will never happen
[19:24:28] <horacsio> so :S :( what can I do?
[19:25:03] <nesoi> what are you trying to do?
[19:25:57] <nesoi> it seems to be working. you don't want to ever hide div 1?
[19:26:12] <horacsio> yes
[19:26:14] <horacsio> thats it
[19:27:49] <nesoi> here, I modified it http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/562/
[19:28:02] <nesoi> prev no longer does anything if div = 1
[19:28:48] <nesoi> also remove that duplicate var for currentDiv
[19:28:57] <nesoi> you only want one of them
[19:29:25] <nesoi> http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/564/
[19:29:49] <horacsio> prev doesn't work :S :S
[19:30:44] <nesoi> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/567/
[19:30:46] <nesoi> that one works
[19:30:48] <horacsio> yes it works :D some issue with jsfiddle
[19:30:59] <horacsio> yes I corrected to ZERO
[19:31:02] <horacsio> thats ok ;)
[19:31:20] <horacsio> hey nesoi you know more than me :D
[19:31:27] <kevinHaire> http://jsfiddle.net/Qw75j/568/
[19:31:41] <kevinHaire> same idea, little safer
[19:31:49] <nesoi> maybe about programming in general, but I'm a novice at jquery and javascript
[19:32:49] <rina> I went from english lit to programming
[19:32:52] <rina> so anyone can do it
[19:33:16] <nesoi> anyone who has the patience
[19:33:41] <nesoi> ok, gotta run… later all
[19:33:50] <horacsio> whats != means?
[19:33:59] <rina> not equal to
[19:34:12] <kevinHaire> yes, yes it does
[19:34:37] <horacsio> why it keeps going from 4 to 1? and the contrary doesn't?
[19:36:46] <horacsio> why next keeps go next from 4 to 1? :S
[19:42:50] <kevinHaire> sorry not sure what you're asking

[20:26:06] <horacsio> I know I'm very near it but I don't know what I'm doing wrong :S

[20:48:59] <Quest> how to round up corners of a div in pure jQuery, without any css?
[20:51:27] <pixelpimp> you don't
[20:51:33] <pixelpimp> you'd use jquery to alter the CSS
[20:52:25] <Quest> pixelpimp,  theres no direct way?
[20:52:36] <Quest> css 3 is  not for ie
[20:53:47] <pixelpimp> the direct way is CSS
[20:53:55] <pixelpimp> the web is not for IE
[20:54:33] <pixelpimp> you can use any method of adding rounded corners, but they're all going to involve some CSS
[22:07:12] <ipalaus> I know that i can use jQuery.ajaxPrefilter() to handle custom options *before* an ajax request is processed… but there is anyway to do a post filter? I wanted to check some HTTP codes always. Any suggestion? thanks in advance!
