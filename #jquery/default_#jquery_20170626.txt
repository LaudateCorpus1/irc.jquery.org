[02:33:15] <MaxLeiter> will $("[data-translate=\"true\"]") work as expected?
[02:33:22] <MaxLeiter> i.e. match with [data-translate="true"]?
[02:51:15] <Cork> MaxLeiter: yes
[02:51:27] <Cork> MaxLeiter: as long as the text of the field is actually "true"
[04:45:33] <billysun> hello - I want to find exact string match. So if arr= ["/foo", "/bar"] - I want arr.includes("/") to return false. something like that
[04:45:45] <billysun> anyone have suggestion?
[04:47:17] <Cork> billysun: uh, you mean it doesn't?
[04:47:37] <Cork> ["/foo", "/bar" ].includes("/")
[04:47:37] <Cork> false
[04:50:25] <r3ply> billysun, you can use a library like https://lodash.com/
[04:51:34] <billysun> I'm tried in another browser and it works
[04:51:47] <billysun> wow - I didn't think that it would be a browser issue
[05:01:31] <Cork> billysun: .includes is a very new method
[05:01:47] <billysun> yeah
[05:01:51] <Cork> billysun: you can try .indexOf("/") > 0
[05:02:02] <Cork> oppps
[05:02:06] <Cork> billysun: you can try .indexOf("/") > -1
[05:02:18] <billysun> thanks
[05:02:23] <Cork> that one is backwards compatible to ie4 at least, i think it goes even longer >_>
[07:54:16] <jsdoodl> when filter I want to disable Checkboxes that not filter more --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/94/
[07:55:54] <Cork> jsdoodl: are all you want to do is hide all elements that don't match all the checkboxes?
[07:56:06] <Cork> (if that is the case this code is overcomplicated)
[07:58:47] <jsdoodl> Cork: for example, If you check "white" and "horse" I want checkboxes that not has that info be disalbed
[07:59:17] <Cork> jsdoodl: http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/95/
[08:01:08] <Cork> opps missed the dot -_-'
[08:01:44] <jsdoodl> Cork: like this --> http://imgur.com/PQcNaE6
[08:03:52] <Cork> jsdoodl: also don't highjack rel, use data-<something> or even better value=""
[08:04:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/96/
[08:05:36] <jsdoodl> Cork: ok, nice to know :)
[08:05:41] <Cork> jsdoodl: and for the disable http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/97/
[08:06:29] <jsdoodl> Cork: oh thx! =)
[08:07:21] <Cork> i dind't plan to just nag at you :P
[08:08:07] <jsdoodl> Cork: its cool =)
[08:20:03] <jsdoodl> Cork: Find a bug, if I choose "yellow" , I can then choose "chicken", but there is no yellow chicken
[08:20:11] <jsdoodl> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/97/
[08:20:32] <Cork> jsdoodl: ya, that becomes much harder
[08:20:45] <Cork> then you have to have a list of what exists
[08:21:02] <Cork> the current solution just means you can only check one checkbox from each group
[08:21:35] <jsdoodl> Ok, but if I put all in same group?
[08:21:36] <MikeD_> "only check on checkbox" is a radio
[08:21:45] <MikeD_> s/on/one
[08:22:03] <Cork> MikeD_: except you can't uncheck a radio
[08:22:32] <Cork> jsdoodl: to do what you ask for you would have to grab all the element classes and then check against that list to enable and disable individual checkboxes
[08:23:06] <Cork> so a many times more complext solution
[08:23:47] <MikeD_> jsdoodl: what is this example supposed to be a simplified version of?
[08:24:52] <Cork> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/94/
[08:25:57] <MikeD_> yeah, but what real(ish) scenario is the contrived example based on?
[08:26:58] <Cork> doesn't look contrived to me, it is just a filter solution
[08:29:16] <MikeD_> i was imagining something car-related with "year" and "type" filter groups
[08:29:51] <Cork> ah, you mean the content is contrived ya, sure didn't really care about that
[08:31:30] <jsdoodl> MikeD_ I think it is just made of someone
[08:31:32] <MikeD_> yeah, just wondering how the "no results" in the yellow chicken example translates back to the real code
[08:32:51] <jsdoodl> MikeD_ did you find any solution?
[08:33:33] <MikeD_> i don't understand the problem yet :)
[08:34:10] <Cork> MikeD_: he wants the checkbox to not be able to filter to a solution where there is no results
[08:34:34] <Cork> i found the request to be fairly straight forward, the code... not so much though :)
[08:34:56] <FilipNortic_> you could but in a all option as a default radio
[08:35:20] <Cork> FilipNortic_: that doesn't really help though
[08:35:39] <Cork> you still have to figure out a way to disable combinations that would yield no result
[08:36:33] <Cork> the only way i can think of is to do a filter over the result list for each checkbox as soon as you change enyone of them
[08:36:35] <MikeD_> And the order would be important between the two groups... year-then-type could have different results than type-then-year  and the problem would get more complicated if there was another group
[08:36:44] <Cork> but that is utterly horrible for performance
[08:37:28] <Cork> hmm, unless...
[08:38:06] <Cork> hmm, no that wont work...
[08:38:34] <FilipNortic_> yeah or something ugly like non visible list for each element with allowed compinations. But that's just horrible
[08:38:34] <MikeD_> it's an interesting puzzle
[08:38:53] <Cork> jsdoodl: the best option is prob to store the combinations that is allowed on each checkbox
[08:39:11] <Cork> it makes it a lot less dynamic, but it can at least be reliable and fast
[08:39:32] <MikeD_> heh, now the question will be to figure out how to build those allowed combinations lists
[08:39:44] <FilipNortic_> well the rules have to be stored somewhere
[08:39:49] <Cork> ya
[08:40:19] <jsdoodl> all ideas will really help
[08:40:31] <MikeD_> I'm assuming the real data comes from a dynamic source too, so the data might change over time and each request has potentially different dimensionality
[08:41:03] <jsdoodl> the data may change, but assume not very often
[08:41:14] <jsdoodl> it could be hardcoded
[08:41:16] <Cork> jsdoodl: i'm thinking something like <input type="checkbox" value="yellow" data-options=["cow","chicken"]">
[08:41:44] <Cork> then you would just have to select all checkboxes disable everyone except the current one and the ones from data-options
[08:42:54] <jsdoodl> this is a real brainteaser!
[08:43:24] <Cork> so var options = $(this).data('options'); inputs.not(this).not(function() { return options.indexOf(this.value) > 0; }).prop('disabled', true)
[08:44:03] <Cork> it's the only decent solution i can think of
[08:45:01] <jsdoodl> Cork: did you get it to work?
[08:45:20] <Cork> it works, but i don't have the time to build the arrays for the inputs
[08:45:39] <jsdoodl> ok
[11:02:00] <mpathy> Hi there.. I want to select the second last td in a tr, and color it green if it contains 20.. I did: $( "tr td:nth-last-child(2):contains('20')" ).css('background-color','#81bc38');  - but it didnt work
[11:02:25] <mpathy> You know why? And, alternatively, is there a contains not - selector?
[11:07:18] <taplar> you have an example of what you tried?
[11:08:23] <mpathy> also $( "tr td:nth-last-of-type(2):contains('20')" ).css('background-color','#81bc38'); doesnt
[11:08:37] <taplar> you have an example of what you tried?
[11:09:09] <mpathy> taplar: I have a table, with table rows, and tds in it.. I want to select the second last td and color it. Would have to do a mock up because of the data
[11:09:25] <taplar> do you have a fiddle showing what you have tried?
[11:10:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/tbw6rjym/ seems to work
[11:12:00] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/tbw6rjym/1/
[11:12:47] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/tbw6rjym/2/
[11:13:11] <mpathy> https://codepen.io/mpathy/pen/mwBoxe
[11:14:30] <taplar> jquery isn't defined in that codepen.  and my fiddle appears to work

[11:18:32] <mpathy> taplar: thx.. indeed.. must be something else.. those Datatables seem to overwrite it.. was the same problem that I just couldnt apply a class in the view.. but thx I will look where is the problem, thought my selector was wrong

[11:42:05] <bharathi> hi all
[11:42:54] <bharathi> trying to generate a pdf using datatables pdfmake option - but it doesnt print all the columns from datatable
[11:43:00] <bharathi> few columns are cut off
[11:43:05] <bharathi> how can it be solved?
[11:43:11] <bharathi> any ideas?
[11:43:43] <bharathi> Hellooooo
[11:44:05] <taplar> you might have better luck asking on the datatables message boards
[11:44:13] <taplar> there are not a lot of DT experts around.
[12:08:37] <bharathi> is there a way to display all the columns of a datatable in PDF ?
[12:09:01] <bharathi> currently it cuts off a few columns
[12:09:36] <bharathi> any idea?
[12:11:46] <bharathi> helloooo
[12:11:55] <taplar> same answer as before man
[12:47:06] <JrWebDev> wouldnt this cause a variable in post $_POST['hi'] ???             $.post('/this_same_url', { hi: 'Hello!' }, function(){
[12:47:07] <JrWebDev>                         window.location.href = window.location.href;
[12:47:07] <JrWebDev>             })
[12:47:40] <taplar> it should
[12:48:04] <JrWebDev> with a value of Hello! right?
[12:48:09] <taplar> yep
[12:48:24] <JrWebDev> jesus christ so wth
[12:48:31] <JrWebDev> thanks taplar let me see wahts wrong
[12:51:22] <taplar> it'd be there for the ajax request, not for the 'window.location.href' part
[12:51:59] <JrWebDev> so i have it as a post request but when i look at the browser debugger my request is a GET
[12:52:04] <JrWebDev> with no parameters
[12:52:19] <taplar> your success method if it causes the page to reload would be a GET
[12:52:39] <JrWebDev> damn so how do i basically refresh the page so that i can see my parameter data
[12:52:58] <taplar> what is your post logic doing?
[12:53:12] <JrWebDev> just to keep it very simple
[12:53:25] <taplar> that's not telling me your intention man
[12:53:30] <JrWebDev> umm
[12:53:35] <taplar> your doing a post to....
[12:53:41] <JrWebDev> the same page
[12:53:44] <taplar> no
[12:53:45] <JrWebDev> just want to echo the variable
[12:53:48] <taplar> why are you doing that
[12:54:08] <taplar> ok, if it is echoed it would be in the response to that ajax request
[12:54:20] <JrWebDev> oh man i mean..its too much to say man...its basically a chat ...when i click i want to apply some datas to a variable
[12:54:36] <JrWebDev> and have it echo'ed out
[12:54:50] <JrWebDev> from their i can work my magic
[12:54:55] <taplar> ok, so are you storing the message on the backend some how?
[12:55:01] <JrWebDev> i want to
[12:55:34] <taplar> but you are not currently?
[12:56:18] <taplar> because i'm assuming your reload is for like showing the last x messages or something
[12:56:51] <JrWebDev> so basically i have a tr..i click tr and get a value from tr data-value... take that tr data-value, and apply to a variable taht is echoing the variable..and show that data ( i guess refresh page)
[12:56:52] <taplar> which isn't optimal, but we'll roll with it for now
[12:57:44] <taplar> so you are expecting the reload to show the data?
[12:58:06] <JrWebDev> well yes...if i can see the data without reloading thats better
[12:58:27] <taplar> then don't reload.  the response of that post should contain what you need, i would assume
[12:58:31] <taplar> you could console log it
[12:58:55] <taplar> try passing in a variable to that method and console log it.  or console.log(arguments);
[12:59:21] <taplar> or you could look at the network response to that ajax request in your developer tools
[12:59:36] <JrWebDev> hold on
[12:59:55] <JrWebDev> cause i think that variable will have to be given back to php to do some logic..i think i would need to post it
[12:59:58] <HyP3r> hello everybody. How can I send complex dictonarys with $.post? If I do something like that: $.post('/devices/control/', { 'method': 'set_state', 'args': {'device_class': device_class, 'serial_number': serial_number, 'state': state} });
[13:00:24] <HyP3r> Its transformd to simple key/value pairs
[13:00:35] <taplar> HyP3r: right, you're sending json
[13:00:48] <HyP3r> Like that args[device_class]"0001"
[13:00:54] <HyP3r> taplar: how can I fix that?
[13:01:03] <taplar> i'm not understanding the issue?
[13:02:12] <HyP3r> taplar: I have serverside Python Django and I want that I have the same dictonary as posted. But I have something like that: ['args[device_class]':'foo', ..]
[13:02:36] <taplar> oh
[13:03:12] <JrWebDev> taplar...i tookout window.location.href and my behavior is correct...its post and i can see my request parameters are correct...is it possible to have my page display with that new information..i should see that parameter data being echoed onto my page..why isnt that happening?
[13:04:12] <taplar> HyP3r: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/  try giving it the optional dataType as 'json' and see if anything changes
[13:04:19] <jsdoodl> how to get addClass --> .disabled to value "one" and "two" --> https://jsfiddle.net/xaf3p5gr/
[13:04:49] <taplar> JrWebDev: web requests are not inherently stateful
[13:05:06] <taplar> just because you did a post with data, doesn't mean that data will also be sent on subsequent requests
[13:05:18] <taplar> if you want that data to be sent on later requests, you will have to put it on them
[13:05:36] <taplar> otherwise persist the data on the back end somehow that the later requests will have access to
[13:06:03] <JrWebDev> i should be storing those parameters into a php variable then
[13:06:12] <JrWebDev> if i want to persist them
[13:06:39] <taplar> jsdoodl: you should look at filter
[13:07:16] <taplar> find the inputs, filter on those who'se value is in the array, and then do whatever to them
[13:07:51] <taplar> your 'this' context as you have it doesn't reflect the elements the expression in the if matched
[13:08:37] <jsdoodl> taplar: ok, you know how to do it?
[13:08:48] <taplar> yep, but i want you to dig a little first, :)
[13:08:52] <taplar> look for filter in the api
[13:09:28] <jsdoodl> ok =)
[13:09:48] <HyP3r> taplar: if I change dataType to JSON the Response is parsed with JSON. But I want to send JSON
[13:09:57] <HyP3r> taplar: can't find answers for that
[13:09:59] <taplar> ah, crud
[13:10:16] <taplar> ok, so you may have to switch to using $.ajax so you can set the contentType then
[13:10:54] <HyP3r> taplar: I have allready tested that buts not working
[13:11:09] <taplar> have you tried stringify'ing the object before you send it
[13:11:10] <taplar> ?
[13:11:25] <HyP3r> taplar: oh sorry you wrote contentType
[13:11:28] <HyP3r> I'll test that
[13:11:30] <taplar> ya
[13:11:40] <taplar> dataType is the response, contentType is the request, iirc
[13:16:21] <HyP3r> taplar: now it seesm to work but now my server can handle this :(
[13:16:42] <taplar> heh, the life of a developer, ^_^
[13:16:56] <HyP3r> *can't
[13:17:19] <taplar> what's your backend?
[13:18:59] <taplar> cause usually if the frontend sends it correctly, the backend should be able to auto parse it into objects, from my experience
[13:19:28] <HyP3r> taplar: Python Django nothing special
[13:19:41] <HyP3r> taplar: usecase is also pretty easy: send dictonary to the server :)
[13:19:44] <taplar> ah, in that case i got no clue, >_<
[13:21:44] <taplar> maybe this is helpful? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25608875/sending-json-from-template-to-view-in-django
[13:21:48] <HyP3r> taplar: serverside it seems like that I have to reparse the incoming data: data = json.loads(request.body.decode('utf-8'))
[13:31:19] <JrWebDev> why is this so hard.... click a button...when i click let $a = 1 .. if(isset($a)) {echo $a};...how
[13:32:31] <taplar> it looks like you are intermixing js and php
[13:32:50] <taplar> let $a looks like js, it wouldn't be available to echo in php
[13:33:06] <taplar> further more, php runs before js
[13:33:17] <taplar> on the server before it ever gets back to the client to run the js
[13:34:51] <JrWebDev> i see okay
[13:35:04] <JrWebDev> let me keep trying. this is soo difficult man..3 days on the same problem
[13:35:17] <taplar> lets talk about that.  what exactly are you trying to do?
[13:35:30] <taplar> not what your current issue is.  what your goal is
[13:35:34] <JrWebDev> i would need an essay to write down what i am doing
[13:35:56] <taplar> start small.  you said you have some tr that has data-* on it
[13:36:58] <taplar> and when you click the tr you want to ...
[13:37:13] <jsdoodl> taplar haha.. this was hard
[13:37:21] <taplar> jsdoodl:  you get it?
[13:38:42] <jsdoodl> taplar --> naa https://jsfiddle.net/xaf3p5gr/2/
[13:38:58] <taplar> lol, no man
[13:39:03] <taplar> you're filtering on the wrong thing
[13:39:06] <taplar> you filter on the inputs
[13:39:19] <jsdoodl> oh
[13:39:43] <JrWebDev> iam try to write this all down once and for all im tired of this
[13:39:52] <JrWebDev> ima use jsfiddle
[13:40:08] <taplar> i'm just talking conceptually JrWebDev
[13:40:23] <JrWebDev> ima try to make it simple as possible
[13:40:27] <JrWebDev> brb
[13:41:43] <taplar> jsdoodl: https://jsfiddle.net/xaf3p5gr/4/
[13:42:37] <taplar> the api for filter should have examples similar to that
[13:43:40] <jsdoodl> taplar: ok, but that didnt work for me
[13:43:45] <taplar> ?
[13:44:04] <jsdoodl> code didnt do anything
[13:44:11] <taplar> what code?
[13:44:36] <taplar> the update i linked you is incomplete, if that i what you mean
[13:44:37] <jsdoodl> https://jsfiddle.net/xaf3p5gr/4/
[13:44:43] <jsdoodl> ok
[13:44:54] <taplar> i mean, look at the comment, :)
[14:16:18] <w3gi> hallo, i have a div-element which contains pictures and if i click on some picture i want that this picture stay in the viewport of the div
[14:16:51] <jsdoodl> https://jsfiddle.net/xaf3p5gr/5/
[14:17:47] <taplar> woah, what happened to the fiddle?
[14:18:10] <taplar> you were literally one statement away from what you wanted
[14:18:55] <taplar> and you are still not understanding the usage of 'this' and context
[14:19:06] <jsdoodl> taplar oh was rethinking when I didnt solved it
[14:19:12] <rapha> Hi!
[14:19:37] <taplar> jsdoodl: so ask about your confusion.  don't wipe the slate clean man, :|
[14:19:40] <w3gi> is there a function to scroll a div with the overflow: scroll; option in css?
[14:19:48] <rapha> The first answer at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40486278/how-to-select-a-tag-has-specific-file-type-in-href-using-jquery , how bad is doing something like this performance-wise?
[14:20:30] <JrWebDev> taplar are you tehre
[14:20:33] <taplar> rapha: doesn't look that bad
[14:20:47] <taplar> w3gi: there is a scrollTo method
[14:21:07] <taplar> iirc
[14:21:20] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/1tg1m5c1/ taplar i hope this makes sense
[14:21:24] <JrWebDev> it should be simple to understand
[14:22:06] <jsdoodl> taplar --> this is what im trying to do
[14:22:06] <jsdoodl> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/97/
[14:22:32] <rapha> taplar: thank you! I was just worried because of the Regex...
[14:22:33] <JrWebDev> https://jsfiddle.net/1tg1m5c1/1/
[14:22:50] <taplar> jsdoodl: that's completely different from what you were asking about before
[14:22:53] <jsdoodl> when clicking on white it filter and disable
[14:23:30] <taplar> JrWebDev: why do you need to post?
[14:24:01] <JrWebDev> i want to hide data from url
[14:24:14] <JrWebDev> security
[14:24:21] <taplar> no, why a post at all?
[14:24:27] <taplar> jsdoodl: this line? $(this).closest('fieldset').find('input').not(this).prop('disabled', this.checked);
[14:24:31] <jsdoodl> taplar: but when you click on "yellow", you can still then click on "chicken"
[14:24:48] <JrWebDev> hol don taplar
[14:26:16] <jsdoodl> taplar: that should change so it disable only checkbox that has no more relatives
[14:26:28] <taplar> jsdoodl: those checkboxes are in different fieldsets
[14:26:39] <jsdoodl> yes
[14:26:41] <taplar> by your statement, you are only affecting inputs in your elments fieldset
[14:26:53] <w3gi> taplar, it seens that this dont work: $('#picList').scrollTo('#actPicInList');
[14:27:33] <w3gi> div has ID picList and the a-elemtent has ID actPicInList
[14:27:37] <jsdoodl> taplar: should I have all in same?
[14:28:03] <JrWebDev> taplar cause the code also does backend database stuff...from_id and to_id are id's in a column...so when i post it gets sent to server side..but at the same time when i click a table row i want to show messages from each name...so when i click tr with value 2...sql command is select id with value of 2 from table ..when i click tr with data value 1...select id with value 1 from table ....tahts why i need post
[14:28:04] <taplar> jsdoodl: no, you just have to go closest() to an element that has all the inputs
[14:28:39] <jsdoodl> taplar: like tags --> http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/98/
[14:28:54] <jsdoodl> but then it disable all if I just click once
[14:29:28] <taplar> jsdoodl: what about that is not what you want?
[14:29:33] <JrWebDev> taplar, idk if ican just use get when i click to do a select id with value tr 2...and then do a post when i click the send button
[14:30:28] <JrWebDev> if that makes life easier than fine...
[14:30:34] <jsdoodl> taplar: I want filter to stay enable if there is more filter on the result
[14:31:09] <JrWebDev> but if i can simply click and get the new information and see it then i can work from there...i just need to finish this simple step
[14:31:10] <taplar> what filter?
[14:31:28] <taplar> JrWebDev: so the post updates the database, correct?
[14:31:40] <JrWebDev> yes it does
[14:31:42] <jsdoodl> taplar: if i click "yellow" I get "yellow cow" and  "yellow horse"
[14:32:00] <JrWebDev> and i guess i can use a get to simply retrieve the data from DB
[14:32:03] <taplar> then the response of that request could return all the latest messages, and you could use that response to redraw your messages on the page
[14:32:07] <jsdoodl> taplar: in that case I want "cow" and "horse" to be enable to filter on
[14:32:39] <taplar> jsdoodl: then that sounds like what you were doing before
[14:32:45] <taplar> instead of closest() on tags
[14:32:59] <w3gi> taplar, $('#picList').scrollLeft('300'); works fine...
[14:33:22] <w3gi> so i just need to find out the right value...
[14:33:38] <taplar> w3gi: looks like i misspoke on the scrollTo method.  i'll have to search for what it is i'm thinking of.  but i got a few convos going on now that i'm gonna have to finish some before i can focus on more, so it may be a little bit, :)
[14:34:21] <JrWebDev> taplar, so when i click..i would have to send an ajax request right?? i should use a get to a php file that simply runs the command?
[14:34:56] <w3gi> sure... all i need now is get the offset to left side of parent of #actPicInList
[14:35:10] <hlve> what would the selector change to for css modules in jQuery for this line?    ~~~~   if (this.hasClass("plus"))    if the plus class is modulized with styles.plus?
[14:35:11] <hlve> >_>
[14:35:16] <taplar> ajax -> php -> update database (or whatever) -> return messages that should be displayed
[14:36:15] <jsdoodl> taplar, yes but like this : http://i.imgur.com/6nwGHDM.png
[14:36:40] <taplar> jsdoodl: then that isn't a simple statement like you have
[14:37:03] <taplar> you'll have to do your statement, and then examine the results to see if you then need to disable other filters
[14:38:08] <jsdoodl> I have added a class to all statement and get all classes from those who is filtered
[14:38:36] <jsdoodl> now I only have to something like this
[14:38:37] <jsdoodl> if ($('input[type*="checkbox"]').attr('value') == thisAttr) { 				$(this).parent().removeClass('disabled'); 			}
[14:39:19] <jsdoodl> thisAttr in this case = 'yellow cow horse'
[14:39:24] <hlve> Anyb0dy?
[14:40:29] <taplar> jsdoodl: actually it just occured to me.  if these checkboxes are exclusionary within their fieldset, why are you not using radio buttons?
[14:43:48] <jsdoodl> taplar: cause you can click multiple, like white and blue http://jsfiddle.net/d6Zyr/99/
[14:44:33] <taplar> ok, so you only want to disable inputs if they are not still a valid filter result
[14:51:21] <jsdoodl> taplar: yes =)

[15:00:26] <adrian_1908> Hello. I'm trying to check (just once) if the page is taller than the viewport, to display a back-to-top button. Is there some best practice approach to this? I saw various different value queries online.
[15:01:14] <taplar> adrian_1908: seems like you'd run the check on page load and check the document/body innerHeight probably
[15:01:36] <taplar> but just once?
[15:02:33] <adrian_1908> Yeah, or maybe on resize. I want to keep things simple and not bind to a possibly constant event trigger like scrolling activity.
[15:02:57] <taplar> usually you would bind to scroll, and throttle it
[15:03:04] <taplar> or debounce
[15:04:08] <taplar> i know there is a plugin out there for jquery throttle/debounce, but there is also lodash methods to do the same iirc.
[15:04:25] <adrian_1908> Yes, but if I add a button to the page bottom itself (not a hovering element), then I think a single check is just fine, no? If the content fits on page load, it gets no button, otherwise it does.
[15:04:42] <taplar> ah, then yes
[15:04:48] <jsdoodl> taplar: missed that one, thanx, was trying in someother way :P
[15:05:19] <taplar> $(document).on('load', function(){ /*check innerHeight here */ }); should work for you then
[15:05:47] <adrian_1908> ok, I'll give that a shot, thanks!
[16:58:09] <JrWebDev> how come when you have an ajax post the page doesnt refresh with the post?
[16:58:35] <JrWebDev> how can i post refresh with it so i can se emy post data
[16:59:54] <Woet> huh?
[17:00:03] <Woet> the entire point of ajax is that the page *doesnt* refresh
[17:02:48] <JrWebDev> Woet yeah thats what i thought...woet how do i pass variable to php using ajax...lets say i click...then ajax...let $a = abc and now php can do what it wants...lets say echo... $a now...can i do that with refreshing the page?
[17:03:07] <JrWebDev> without refreshing the page
[17:04:16] <mechanist> hello
[17:04:55] <mechanist> I have an uploading progress bas script on a form page who's doubling the entries on my sql database
[17:04:56] <mechanist> https://pastebin.com/9JukwVak
[17:05:15] <mechanist> how can I fix it?
[17:05:29] <coderfromcincy> @JrWebDev - if you are using the GET method then just pass the variable as a querystring in the url you are making an AJAX request to, otherwise if you're using the POST method then you can pass the variable to the "data" option
[17:06:25] <mechanist> are you speaking with me?
[17:06:30] <pavonia> JrWebDev: You can take the result of the AJAX request and put that as the new contents of a div on your website (if this is what you are asking for)
[17:07:07] <taplar> JrWebDev: http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[17:07:47] <Al_nz1> Why would this print 0 to the console for the number of rows, yet when I type  $('#table_stats > trbody > tr').length; in console I get the correct number of rows?
[17:07:56] <Al_nz1> https://pastebin.com/zxbNSW3R
[17:08:26] <Woet> JrWebDev: why are you using AJAX in the first place?
[17:08:32] <Woet> JrWebDev: oh, nvm.
[17:08:35] <Woet> JrWebDev: see what pavonia said
[17:12:19] <coderfromcincy> A1_nz1 - it's going to print 0 because it's telling you how many rows it found before it started appending new rows to your table, you probably console.logged the variable after it had already iterated through the function and added the dom elements
[17:13:06] <taplar> 'trbody' ?
[17:13:31] <coderfromcincy> well yeah that's a problem too, wtf is trbody lol
[17:13:39] <taplar> :)
[17:15:57] <Al_nz1> coderfromcincy: but there is already 3 rows present when I click the button
[17:16:06] <mechanist> I have an uploading progress bas script on a form page who's doubling the entries on my sql database
[17:16:10] <mechanist> https://pastebin.com/9JukwVak
[17:16:11] <mechanist> how can I fix it?
[17:16:20] <coderfromcincy> A1_nz1 - change "trbody" to "tbody"
[17:17:59] <Woet> mechanist: what makes you think that script is doubling entries in your SQL database?
[17:18:24] <Woet> mechanist: are there multiple AJAX requests? how often is "Second function" output?
[17:18:33] <Al_nz1> coderfromcincy: good catch
[17:18:36] <Al_nz1> thanks
[17:18:53] <coderfromcincy> taplar caught that one
[17:18:55] <coderfromcincy> haha
[17:20:46] <mechanist> Woet: because I've checked so many times on the database, and deleting the id="uploadForm" matching the jquery script it doesn't double
[17:21:26] <Woet> mechanist: but it still works..?
[17:21:31] <mechanist> yes
[17:21:39] <mechanist> [23:18] <Woet> mechanist: are there multiple AJAX requests? how often is "Second function" output?
[17:21:43] <mechanist> I see none of them
[17:22:10] <Woet> mechanist: doesnt ajaxSubmit submit the form via ajax..?
[17:22:46] <coderfromcincy> ajaxSubmit isn't a core jquery function
[17:23:51] <mechanist> hmmm
[17:23:57] <mechanist> Woet; how can I see it?
[17:33:50] <taplar> mechanist: i'm assuming you are seeing double because you are not cancelling the original submit
[17:34:12] <taplar> you have the cancels in there, but they are commented out
[17:36:10] <mechanist> yes becayse I want to go on the other page because it tells the file details
[17:36:22] <mechanist> but going there the entry is doubling
[17:36:25] <mechanist> anyway
[17:36:40] <mechanist> I've just found that this script is not working on firefox, just on ie
[17:47:58] <mechanist> hey there?
[17:48:42] <taplar> sup
[17:52:00] <cannap> lol i tokenized some strings today to get a faster searach
[17:52:03] <cannap> search
[17:52:07] <cannap> and then i tried filter
[17:52:17] <cannap> wasted
[18:15:09] <fiord> sup party people
[19:32:08] <jaegerca> So I have these links, $(".container a.remove") and I am trying to add a listener on them with jquerys "on" method, like so: $(".container a.remove").on('click', function(){alert('clicked')}) - this is all fine for elements on the page when it loads, but it's not attaching to content that is being dynamically loaded via ajax - anyone have any clue?
[19:50:09] <jaegerca> I figured it out, I didn't realize there was an anchor and target for this
