[03:05:46] <rashid> hi
[03:06:04] <rashid> can anyone help me with this
[03:06:06] <rashid> http://jsbin.com/feriteqeyu/edit
[03:08:36] <rashid> this line doesn't work:
[03:08:38] <rashid> $(this).find('span').removeClass('glyphicon glyphicon-ok form-control-feedback').addClass('glyphicon glyphicon-remove form-control-feedback');
[03:15:15] <Cork> rashid: $(this) inside the ajax call isn't the same as outside
[03:15:41] <Cork> there are two options 1. var target = $(this) and then inside .done target.find()
[03:15:57] <Cork> 2. $.ajax(context: this).done(function() { $(this) })
[03:16:08] <Cork> (psudo code)
[03:17:20] <rashid> @Cork thanks man lemme try it out
[03:20:08] <rashid> yea works great thanks again
[04:37:00] <fieldservice> Hello, Test, test
[04:39:27] <fieldservice> I didn't used irc many years, I hope I do nothing wrong. Hello, I got a question about jquerys .data() techniq, I tryed to save data for text-nodes (DOM text nodes) but it seems, after defining data like '''$(mytextnode).data('testdata','testvalue')''' that for '''$(mytextnode).data('testdata')''' comes an <undefined> is this normal behavior, or is it a bug?
[04:41:19] <Woet> fieldservice: www.jsfiddle.net
[04:42:04] <fieldservice> Hello PCatinean, Thanks, what Do you mean with this please?
[04:42:20] <fieldservice> sorry, Woet..
[04:42:32] <Woet> fieldservice: please create a working demo of your issue.
[04:43:06] <fieldservice> OK, pls wait a sec
[04:49:44] <fieldservice> Here it is: https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/379681/ - Question was, why jquery do not save data for DOM text-nodes with .data() method/techniq
[04:55:44] <fieldservice> Woet, did You see it? console throws an <undefined>
[05:03:40] <fieldservice> Do You post answer here or anywhere other? Im sorry, used irc since many years not, don't even know if my message posted in the console here throws out on the channel .. ?!
[05:10:30] <Cork> fieldservice: textnodes can't have attributes
[05:11:38] <Cork> fieldservice: https://jsfiddle.net/ht943pk5/1/
[05:16:09] <Cork> fieldservice: also, you won't get personal support in here, you ask the question someone gives a hint and someone else might take over (and a persona that answer might get busy so someone else takes over)
[05:42:39] <fieldservice> Cork: But it seems that data now gets saved, am I dull? Do not understand what You did other ?
[05:43:19] <Cork> fieldservice: $('p').get(0).firstChild will give you the textnode of the p element not the p element
[05:43:28] <Cork> those can't have data
[05:43:47] <Cork> secondly .data() is a jquery function so it doesn't exist on raw dom elements
[05:44:10] <Cork> (hence why testfield.data didn't give you anything)
[05:44:13] <fieldservice> OK. See. No, the goal, target was to save a flag for every text-node.
[05:44:37] <fieldservice> I would suggest, that jquery works over the documentation
[05:44:41] <Cork> jquery doesn't work with text nodes so you will have to look elsewhere
[05:45:04] <Cork> jquery works with dom not nodes
[05:46:18] <fieldservice> for the data() - method/technique is not said 'but not text-nodes' there the documentation says, every DOM-node..
[05:46:40] <Cork> fieldservice: .data is for dom elements, that by definition excludes text nodes
[05:47:07] <Cork> actually everything in jquery is for dom elements
[05:47:30] <Cork> cause again jquery is a dom manipulation framework not a node walker
[05:48:39] <fieldservice> ok, understand. This is so silly, because I don't want to add directly attributes to the text-nodes, the way: mytextnode['testattr'] = true; for example works very good, but
[05:49:13] <fieldservice> it is directly editing the node, what sould be not done, as I understand.
[05:49:13] <Cork> ya, cause then you add a property to the textNode object
[05:49:23] <Cork> again that is not part of the dom tree
[05:49:28] <Cork> so jquery has no concept of it
[05:50:04] <Cork> DOM excludes textNodes in its listings, text nodes becomes part of the parent element
[05:51:19] <fieldservice> Cork: Do you know a way, how I can save a reference for a object in a object, look: var myobj = { mytextnode : [] , ...}
[05:52:02] <fieldservice> The target is to get the list by: myobj[mytextnode]
[05:52:10] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to do?
[05:52:30] <Cork> it is quite unusual to want to store data assosiated with textnodes
[05:52:46] <fieldservice> I want to save the references/pointers to the textnode-objects in a object,
[05:53:07] <Cork> that is what you want to do, not what you are trying to do
[05:53:43] <fieldservice> ??  sorry?
[05:54:04] <Cork> why are you trying to store data references on text noddes
[05:54:43] <fieldservice> Yes may be this is unusual, we have the situation, that we must parse every text in the dom, and save then every textnode with a flag 'parsed'
[05:54:59] <Cork> O_o'
[05:55:15] <fieldservice> the easy way is to add an attribute to the text-node, this works. but as I understand it is
[05:55:52] <fieldservice> not good coding style
[05:56:17] <fieldservice> This O_o looks like a fish that blinks, did you mean that? :)
[05:57:29] <fieldservice> we search for special text-phrases and save the position of this phrases. there are situations, where not all textnodes inside an element change
[05:57:45] <fieldservice> but only one, the target is, next called parsing round only to check this nodes
[06:04:35] <fieldservice> cork: again: var myobj = { mytextnode : [] , ...}; myobj[mytextnode]  = {}; after that, mytextnode === {}, it seems, that myobj[mytextnode] = ... operates on mytextnode itself
[06:08:42] <fieldservice> ok.
[07:31:02] <joao_> hi. i've something like this $(document).ready(function(){  $("#pttoff").click(function(){ 	  	  text.style.display = "none";    	$.get( "/PTTDepressed/", function( data ) { 		$( ".result" ).html( data ); 		//alert( "depressed." ); 		 		});   });
[07:31:49] <joao_> and i've another function for when i click in another image somethin happen. So i have two images to do different things how can i put this only in one image,
[07:32:06] <joao_> when i click something happens when i clcick again another thing happens
[07:33:03] <ryan_ford> select only the 1 image when you add your event listener
[07:35:14] <joao_> ok :) i didn't think on that
[07:35:36] <joao_> and it's possible to change the image or the color, to know what is the state?
[07:35:42] <joao_> if it's pressed or not?
[07:42:04] <ryan_ford> like a border with css?
[07:43:02] <fas3r> Hello
[07:46:28] <fas3r> I'm trying create a wrapper around $.ajax to return proceed request ( POST / GET ). So far I did this : https://pastebin.com/vH4z8DJt . but I'm not able to return the data from inside the function, what do I miss ? thanks
[07:47:38] <fas3r> do be more specific, if I do a .done(function(data) .... on the state returned by the function i get the data, but not from inside. .
[07:53:25] <Cork> fas3r: have a look at .then() it can let you modify the deffered object
[07:55:05] <fas3r> Cork: you mean on the "res" ?
[07:55:15] <Cork> fas3r: also you have variable name collision
[07:55:37] <Cork> (resultQuery and done both define a "data" variable)
[07:55:48] <Cork> no i mean in resultQuery
[07:56:05] <Cork> $.ajax().then(function() { return data });
[07:56:32] <Cork> currently you return in a .done, but .done doesn't do anything with return values
[07:59:41] <fas3r> Cork: oki trying to change
[07:59:43] <fas3r> it*
[07:59:55] <fas3r> thanks for the prompt answer
[08:00:08] <Cork> but ya, you prob want to change one of the argument names
[08:00:58] <Cork> having two arguments both called "data" makes it a bit uncertain what you actually indended
[08:02:33] <fas3r> I understand, I did not know that could be source of errors. checking now, brb in 2/3 minutes
[08:13:18] <Cork> so be clear, it doesn't cause errors for the parser, but the developer reading the code can't be confident if you meant the old or the new data variable
[08:17:08] <fas3r> Cork: thanks . I keep receiving the "state" instead of the data, but I will keep digging.
[08:17:30] <Cork> what state are you talking about?
[08:17:46] <fas3r> the ajax state.
[08:17:58] <Cork> the ajax response you mean?
[08:18:08] <Cork> well that is what you are returning on line 16
[08:18:13] <fas3r> yes  {state: ƒ, always: ƒ, catch: ƒ, pipe: ƒ, then: ƒ, …}
[08:18:50] <Cork> if you want to return settings.data instead, you need to return that variable instead of the one from the ajax call
[08:19:24] <Cork> also why you feel you need to do this when you have the data in settings i'm not sure about
[08:19:43] <Cork> why not just do $.ajax(settings.url).done(function() { settings.data });
[08:20:13] <fas3r> Cork: I did not think about that
[08:21:38] <fas3r> Cork: ok, the "formData" are just the data that will be send with the request
[08:22:07] <Cork> ya?
[08:22:27] <Cork> ah, wait i think i get something now
[08:22:43] <Cork> you expect ajax and res to hold the return value from the .done?
[08:22:50] <Cork> that isn't how deferred objects work
[08:23:34] <Cork> result and ajax will both hold the jqxhr object from the $.ajax call
[08:23:54] <Cork> and res from the $.when call will hold the deferred object from $.when()
[08:24:08] <Cork> none of these will hold the data from the actual call
[08:31:17] <fas3r> yes I would like to return the data itself.
[08:31:20] <fas3r> oki..
[08:57:47] <Anselm> I got a rather strange problem which I am not able to fix, even not with firefox/opera debug mechanisms... Page: https://compact-chart.de/website/#
[08:58:40] <Anselm> klick on 'weiter' or bottom bar, scrolls out, after that when clicking any menu but "blog" it should reload the front screen but also removes the slider in the background and I cannot find out why
[08:59:00] <Anselm> (its transparent for debugging reasons, normally white background to cover the slider
[09:26:18] <ryan_ford> so it's not removing the slider? what's your question?
[09:39:49] <blakespot_wrk> Does anyone know how to simplify these two lines into one statement that restricts from the second line case?
[09:40:02] <blakespot_wrk> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor');
[09:40:11] <blakespot_wrk> $('.section-right .flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').removeClass('decor');
[09:40:16] <Anselm> ryan_ford: it does at several places... when I reload the page several times the img in the background does disappear and I do not understand why
[09:40:17] <blakespot_wrk> Seems there's got to be a way
[09:40:36] <blakespot_wrk> To not add class to all and then remove class immediately after for a subcase of the aforementioned.
[09:40:46] <blakespot_wrk> I just can't get my head around it using jquery parlance
[09:42:07] <ryan_ford> put it in a fiddle or something
[09:46:12] <AdamPDotty> parley?
[09:48:06] <MikeD_> blakespot_wrk: that looks to me like the approach is to set the class on a general selector, then remove from a more-specific selector because the general one was too aggressive
[09:48:26] <AdamPDotty> nearly got it, but how do you start with .not() ?
[09:49:40] <MikeD_> i have no idea what your markup looks like, but usually these kinds of problems usually make me step back and see if there's another (easier) way to not have this problem in the first place
[09:49:57] * AdamPDotty should start by turning javascript on
[09:50:46] <MikeD_> make sure the computer is plugged into the wall outlet... sometimes evil gets in through the power strip
[09:51:10] <AdamPDotty> $('*').not('.section-right').find('.flex-promo').find('.promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor');
[09:51:13] <MikeD_> not sure if that's true, but customer tech support always makes you plug into the wall directly
[09:51:18] <ryan_ford> just oozing surgeprotection
[09:51:47] <AdamPDotty> whew hard work
[09:51:52] * AdamPDotty uses his towel
[09:52:02] <ryan_ford> i think techsupport is just trying to return early on the type of people that report blank screens when they're computers aren't powered on
[09:52:26] <MikeD_> wait, was that a sweat reference or so bugblatter beast doesn't see you?
[09:52:48] <AdamPDotty> "My Computer does not work." "Well, is it Sunday?"
[09:59:23] <blakespot_wrk> MikeD_: Right. Are you aware of a way of saying "apply it to all of the set (mentioned in first line) except the subset (mentioned in the second line)?
[09:59:39] <blakespot_wrk> AdamPDotty: Ahhh.
[10:00:03] <MikeD_> that's what jquery's .not() operator does
[10:00:10] <undefined_bob> server at office crashed because I tried to edit an image in photoshop -.-
[10:02:26] <ryan_ford> on the server machine?
[10:15:25] <blakespot_wrk> What the hell, the code AdamPDotty wrote worked when I tried it.
[10:15:42] <blakespot_wrk> I commented it out and tried something else, then put it back, as before - not working any longer.
[10:15:56] <blakespot_wrk> These types of things are unnerving
[10:17:53] * AdamPDotty built in a self destruction timer.
[10:19:22] <ryan_ford> inspector gadget in the house
[11:43:14] <blakespot_wrk> So,
[11:43:15] <blakespot_wrk> $('*').not('.section-right').find('.flex-promo').find('.promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor');
[11:43:35] <blakespot_wrk> Is actually finding flex-promo .promo-content a INSIDE .section-right
[11:43:38] <blakespot_wrk> How can that be?
[11:45:17] <ryan_ford> matched a different query I'd guess
[11:47:02] <ryan_ford> I'd bet you could hone that query a l;ittle better
[11:49:30] <blakespot_wrk> ryan_ford: This does what I want it to:
[11:49:32] <blakespot_wrk> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor');
[11:49:40] <blakespot_wrk> $('.section-right .flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').removeClass('decor');
[11:49:55] <blakespot_wrk> two lines there -- first adds class to all target, then second removes it from the unwanted subset
[11:50:08] <blakespot_wrk> But it seems poor to do two passes like that and needlessly add classes where it's not needed
[11:50:30] <blakespot_wrk> I have been trying to find a simpler way to write those two lines (those lines which do get me what I want)
[11:50:36] <blakespot_wrk> About to give up perhaps
[11:50:40] <ryan_ford> you could filter the results maybe?
[11:51:13] <blakespot_wrk> In what particular fashion?
[11:56:24] <ryan_ford> could you just do something like $(':not(.section-right) .flex-promo .promo-content' ...the-rest)
[11:57:13] <ryan_ford> using the :not selector instead of the not method
[11:59:18] <ryan_ford> that or using filter to remove any elements that find .section-right in closest()
[12:09:05] <blakespot_wrk> ryan_ford: In this form?
[12:09:40] <ryan_ford> well tailor it to your actual DOM
[12:09:47] <blakespot_wrk> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor'):not(.section-right) .flex-promo .promo-content').find('a');
[12:09:50] <blakespot_wrk> ?
[12:10:16] <ryan_ford> you can use it as a selector
[12:10:41] <ryan_ford> same as .this or #that you can use :not(.this)
[12:10:45] <blakespot_wrk> So start with the core which is -> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor');
[12:10:50] <ryan_ford> inside the $() query
[12:10:51] <blakespot_wrk> And then apply a selector to that
[12:11:07] <blakespot_wrk> Leaving that in its orig form more or less?
[12:11:25] <blakespot_wrk> I need to read more about selectors it seems
[12:11:32] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/jquery/not-selector
[12:11:49] <ryan_ford> not to be confused with:
[12:11:51] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/jquery/not
[12:13:14] <blakespot_wrk> But you agree I leave the first line - where I find what I want ( $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content').find('a').addClass('decor'); ) intact and then apply selector to that, yes?
[12:13:25] <blakespot_wrk> So it's (still) an add and subtract
[12:15:58] <ryan_ford> if your initial query specifies that whichever possible ancestor is :not(.section-right) then you shouldn't need to subtract anything
[12:16:44] <ryan_ford> understand I haven't seen any html, so it may need tweaking to your exact needs
[12:17:26] <blakespot_wrk> Ok working towards it
[12:17:28] <blakespot_wrk> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content:not(.section-right)').find('a').addClass('decor');
[12:17:32] <blakespot_wrk> Not quite
[12:18:34] <blakespot_wrk> Perhaps
[12:18:34] <blakespot_wrk> $('.flex-promo-text .promo-content:not(.section-right .flex-promo-text .promo-content)').find('a').addClass('decor');
[12:18:37] <blakespot_wrk> trying
[12:19:06] <blakespot_wrk> Ahh
[12:19:08] <blakespot_wrk> I think that has it
[12:19:43] <MikeD_> is it better to build a form and [re]populate it on demand, or just empty the container and rebuild the controls with current/updated data?
[12:19:45] <ryan_ford> looks like a doozy
[12:21:34] <ryan_ford> without any more details, I would think updating would be more performant
[13:26:50] <MikeD_> .dialog() creates a window with my content squooshed ... is that normal?  is height: "100%" supposed to work?
[18:12:04] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:12:23] <robertmaxrees> there are people here :)
[18:15:09] <gambl0re> if anyone knows how to get values of all form input fields, send me a pm. thanks
[18:15:43] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/val/
[18:15:45] <robertmaxrees> you'd use this.
[18:16:15] <robertmaxrees> probably off a $('form').find('input') - use a .each
[18:16:42] <robertmaxrees> there's also http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/, depending on your needs.
[18:46:46] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[19:25:11] <jak2000> robertmaxrees how are you now?
[19:25:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:25:36] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean "now"?
[19:30:36] <jak2000> forget the "now"
[19:35:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:35:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm alright i guess.
[19:35:17] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[19:35:48] <jak2000> alright...... coding... my favourite ....
[19:37:20] <robertmaxrees> not a fan of programming?
[23:39:38] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/z4Lqnwm2/1/  i want clicked goto value only instead of all
