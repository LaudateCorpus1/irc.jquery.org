[01:18:50] <RandomSerb> hello. https://jsfiddle.net/jc73qard/ . What I'm trying to do is create json list for each row, with objects so that properties are each td's class name, and values are what's in td/th > a
[01:39:19] <robertmaxrees> RandomSerb you want .map() -> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[01:39:31] <robertmaxrees> make you do the extra .get() call when you're done
[01:48:46] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees, I decided to let that train of thoughts go. found easier solution to what i want to do
[01:48:55] <robertmaxrees> and that was?
[01:49:09] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees, now, https://hastebin.com/rehorahuni.js is my code, and that array gets cleaned for some reason
[01:49:13] <RandomSerb> not sure why
[01:49:23] <RandomSerb> in the end, I only get one value in it
[01:49:24] <robertmaxrees> :/
[01:49:37] <RandomSerb> it's like it overwrites it with every push
[01:49:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:49:57] <robertmaxrees> this would be stupid easy with .map()
[01:50:40] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees, with the code given above, I need to extract th > a.text(), create list of those values, and ajax it to the server
[01:50:48] <RandomSerb> I mean, HTML code
[01:51:29] <robertmaxrees> var id_list = cwr.map(function() { return $(this).find('>  a').eq(0).text(); }).get();
[01:51:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[01:55:16] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask why you're scraping the page for data you ostensibly already have since it's coming from the server.
[01:57:01] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees, https://hastebin.com/oyuburacic.js
[01:57:09] <RandomSerb> it returns only last id, too
[01:57:20] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[01:57:42] <robertmaxrees> because you're resetting id_list on every iteration on that candidates selection
[01:57:51] <robertmaxrees> you need nested .map() calls here.
[01:58:07] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees, trust me, it's really hard to rewrite django admin backend to simply output object data
[01:58:24] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees, nested map calls?
[01:58:35] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[01:59:16] <robertmaxrees> right now you're doing id_list = cwr.map() - instead, you want id_list = candidates.map(/*callback*/).get()
[01:59:37] <robertmaxrees> where that callback is going to be something like return cwr.map(function() { return $(this).find('>  a').eq(0).text(); }).get();
[02:01:50] <robertmaxrees> if you're still confused, update your fiddle :)
[02:30:20] <shadowswalker> Hello, how do I make bootstrap selectpicket to show dropdown down of the element insted going up ?
[02:35:31] <undefined_bob> shadowswalker: maybe better ask in ##bootstrap?
[04:58:06] <al_nz1> anyone about for a issue with a plugin for typeahead that uses jquery - nothing beind displayed
[04:58:47] <Cork> al_nz1: it is most likely that the plugin hasn't bound to the elemnent
[04:59:15] <Cork> (and those kind of problems is close to impossible to debug without actually having the problem infront of you)
[05:00:40] <al_nz1> Cork: happy to pay you to take a look
[05:00:47] <al_nz1> its been 2 days and I just cant get past this
[05:01:19] <Cork> al_nz1: make a jsfiddle showing the problem you have; same requirements as i always ask when you come with these problems
[05:01:26] <Cork> wihtout it; you're on your own
[05:01:51] <al_nz1> Cork: and how do I "recreate" my backend server in a fiddle?
[05:02:03] <Cork> you don't
[05:02:16] <Cork> you replace it with a static array or similar
[05:02:55] <al_nz1> thats all well ad good unless the issue is the ajax call itself
[05:03:05] <al_nz1> or something to do with it
[05:03:05] <thykka> you already know the issue?
[05:03:21] <al_nz1> thykka: nope - just a possobility
[05:03:33] <al_nz1> if I knew the issue I would be halfway to the solution
[05:03:39] <thykka> point is, when you take the time to construct a pared-down test case, you might stumble on the cause of your problem
[05:03:50] <thykka> if not, then at least someone else may take a look
[05:03:57] <thykka> without that it's just pointless guessing
[05:04:07] <al_nz1> thykka: and my point is that the code without the ajax would look wildly different
[05:04:21] <thykka> okay, but then at least we'd know that part works
[05:04:27] <thykka> and the problem must exist somewhere else
[05:04:51] <al_nz1> unless maybe there is a public server that will dish up states of america or some test data with ajax?
[05:06:14] <thykka> nobody here is a seer; we cannot possibly know what is wrong with your code, unless you show it..
[05:08:21] <al_nz1> happy to share it via teamviewer (working in the test enviroment) with anyone who wants to have a look
[05:27:26] <al_nz1> well I have tried a bloody fiddle but I cant get it to connect to my endpoint seemingly: http://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/rv7L5gft/17/
[05:35:54] <shoky_> al_nz1: it can't connect because the server isn't replying with CORS headers properly. a cross-origin issue. is it also a different origin server when running in your environment?
[05:36:37] <al_nz1> same server - i just setup a port forward
[05:37:42] <shoky_> al_nz1 you also seem to be using typeahead wrong.. you're supposed to initialize it before the user types anytying
[05:37:44] <shoky_> anything
[05:39:03] <shoky_> you seem to be initializing and re-initializing on every keyup
[05:39:39] <al_nz1> shoky_: I want to allow the user to type 2 characters before it makes a ajax call to get the data to populate the typehead
[05:40:32] <al_nz1> how can i initalise the typeahed when I wont have the data until the user has entered the first two keys
[05:40:37] <shoky_> al_nz1: that's what the minLength option is for
[05:40:58] <al_nz1> shoky_: no - the min length has nothing to do with ajax call
[05:41:50] <al_nz1> min length wont start to filter until min length, my javascript doesnt make ajax call until it has 2 characters
[05:41:57] <shoky_> al_nz1: using a function for the source
[05:42:10] <shoky_> that function would do the ajax call
[05:43:10] <al_nz1> sure, but I dont want to get too many records, so no ajax until the user has entered a few keys
[05:43:40] <shoky_> al_nz1: hence, minLength option ;)
[05:43:57] <shoky_> you can also check the length inside the function probably
[05:44:37] <al_nz1> dude, I tried the minLength option, it did nothing
[05:45:09] <al_nz1> and in any event the way I am waiting until 2 characters then making ajax call is fine right?
[05:45:13] <shoky_> then you used it wrong?
[05:45:32] <shoky_> obviously the way you are doing things is not fine, right?
[05:47:13] <al_nz1> shoky_: somethings not right
[05:47:43] <shoky_> i've mentioned some of those things :p
[05:49:50] <al_nz1> I apprciate your help, but you are going to need to be more specific - what do you want me to change?
[05:53:22] <al_nz1> 1. you mentioned minLength, but even without any length filtering (as a option or by me it doesnt work) - so scratch that
[06:15:10] <shoky_> al_nz1: initialize it only once on page load. use a function for the source option (as per the docs), in which you do the ajax request
[06:15:34] <shoky_> you don't need a keyup handler, typeahead already does that for you
[06:16:09] <al_nz1> shoky_: initalise it how?
[06:16:31] <al_nz1> shoky_: the docs only show a GET, Im using POST
[06:16:59] <al_nz1> because in there GET they are not providing any filtering
[06:21:47] <shoky_> al_nz1: something like this  http://jsfiddle.net/8pLa9yg0/
[06:22:09] <shoky_> you have full control over the ajax request
[06:22:34] <shoky_> typeahead has no idea that ajax is even involved
[06:27:51] <al_nz1> shoky_: thats really nice and works pretty much as expected - I am very grateful. Im still a little fuzzy on why my way didnt work. Your makes it seem so easy
[06:28:13] <shoky_> al_nz1: i just follow docs carefully
[06:28:48] <shoky_> and, you're welcome ;]
[06:29:04] <al_nz1> shoky_: yes - many thanks. very patient too
[06:33:53] <al_nz1> is it possible with that plugin to get (upon selection) other things from the ajax returned from the server, like id ?
[06:42:30] <shoky_> al_nz1: probably
[06:42:54] <al_nz1> afterSelect: function (data) {console.log(data.id)}
[06:42:57] <al_nz1> worked
[06:43:17] <al_nz1> thanks again shoky_.
[06:43:26] <al_nz1> late here so I am off to sleep. cheers
[09:17:06] <RandomSerb> Hello. I'm working on https://jsfiddle.net/jc73qard/2/ . Trying to get tbody th a.text() for each table row and make an array out of that data. What but as it is now, id_list get's rewriten.
[09:20:49] <Cork> RandomSerb: $.map($('table tbody th'), function(elm) { return $(elm).text() }); should give you an array
[09:32:07] <RandomSerb> Cork, that should go within candidates.each() or?
[09:32:41] <Cork> RandomSerb: it replaces the entire thing
[09:34:15] <RandomSerb> Cork, yeah, just figured that out. Great! Thanks!
[14:07:38] <Guy> Good evening, is this where I can ask jquery related questions?
[14:07:43] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[14:08:10] <Guy> Alright, I'll give some context: I'm a master student in CS, currently working on my thesis about edge workers.
[14:08:51] <Guy> My edge worker needs to be able to rewrite urls and inject scripts, and one of those scripts would have to rewrite the css function of jquery
[14:09:50] <Guy> The problem that I currently have is that the (basic) implementation of the new function returns a lot less than the original function
[14:10:33] <robertmaxrees> a few questions: 1- when you say "edge worker", what exactly are you referring to?
[14:11:42] <Guy> It's a new paradigm where a server stands in between the cloud server and the client, in order to handle requests instead of the cloud
[14:11:58] <Guy> Cloudflare offers such functionality, called Cloudflare workers
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> oh, those.
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> never heard them called "edge workers"
[14:13:09] <robertmaxrees> 2: it's generally a bad idea to overwrite a jquery method - why not extend jquery with the method you're looking for?
[14:13:42] <Guy> Ah, there is a reason for that
[14:13:57] <Guy> So, the edge worker that I'm testing has to be tested on multiple websites
[14:14:32] <Guy> since I don't have access to those websites, I have to redirect traffic from my client through the edge worker over a domain that the university owns
[14:15:00] <Guy> those websites that I'm testing, use the jquery library and the css function to add backgrounds, for example
[14:15:08] <Guy> or make calls to the origin server
[14:15:23] <Guy> Since everything runs over our domain, those calls fail
[14:15:30] <robertmaxrees> so by replacing a jquery method, you're going to cause bigger headaches for yourself and for the people that maintain those websites.
[14:15:58] <Guy> Those rewrites do not affect those websites, but are only visible on our domain
[14:16:03] <Guy> An example
[14:16:20] <Guy> I use a dutch newspaper website to test our edge worker
[14:16:35] <Guy> our domain is, for example, uhasselt-wpo.be
[14:16:45] <Guy> To redirect the traffic, we use the folliowing url:
[14:17:00] <Guy> uhasselt-wpo.be/redirect/hln.be
[14:17:13] <Guy> with hln.be being the newspaper website
[14:17:33] <Guy> The edge worker gets our request, gets the original url and acts like a proxy from then on
[14:17:53] <Guy> It makes the request to hln.be, rewrites the body to have all urls refer to our doman
[14:17:55] <robertmaxrees> so what does that have to do with modifying jquery's built-in methods?
[14:17:57] <Guy> It makes the request to hln.be, rewrites the body to have all urls refer to our domain
[14:18:15] <Guy> Well, the body we get back, uses for example css to add backgrounds
[14:18:57] <Guy> The url to those backgrounds I can't seem to reach because of the way the construct their urls
[14:19:12] <Guy> the only place where the url to those backgrounds are finished, is in the css function
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> why not fix your cloudflare worker to allow assets to freely pass?
[14:20:06] <Guy> That would be an issue for our tests, reducing the credibility of our test suit
[14:20:14] <robertmaxrees> it wouldn't though.
[14:21:27] <Guy> The edge worker does not aggregate the assets, it only functions as a pass through. that means that the client asks for those assets
[14:21:33] <Guy> and the test suit is run on the client
[14:21:46] <robertmaxrees> i fail to see how any of that invalidates my suggestion :)
[14:21:46] <Guy> Things that I have to keep in account: no CORS violations
[14:22:05] <Guy> Everything must go through the edge worker
[14:22:14] <robertmaxrees> right...? so let it act as a passthrough.
[14:22:15] <Guy> without using any other domain
[14:22:29] <robertmaxrees> if an asset is recognized as coming from a particular path, pass that through.
[14:22:53] <robertmaxrees> you won't face CORS violations in this case since you're proxying it all in the cloudflare worker
[14:23:06] <robertmaxrees> to the browser, it's the same domain.,
[14:23:19] <Guy> The worker will let everything pass through, but the client does not allow it
[14:23:29] <robertmaxrees> the client isn't the issue here though.
[14:23:34] <robertmaxrees> the issue is your worker
[14:24:00] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm unclear about what you're actually trying to accomplish.
[14:24:02] <Uhkis> i wonder what the rules of referencing irc in thesis are in belgian universities :D
[14:24:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:24:41] <Guy> Well, I tried to get documentation about the css method to reimplement it, but the repo is a bit sparce in info. Enough info though on how to use it
[14:24:44] <robertmaxrees> Guy do you have a simple diagram showing the desired architecture?
[14:24:59] <Guy> I'll try to get you one asap
[14:25:07] <Guy> also with screenshots with the issue I'm running in
[14:25:11] <robertmaxrees> Guy that's why you don't want to reimplement it.  but this all sounds really phishy
[14:25:18] <robertmaxrees> no need for screenshots.
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> just the diagram of the basic overview.
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> i gotta go in a few, just fwiw
[14:30:22] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[14:34:51] <Guy> Alright, I have the diagram
[14:55:53] <Guy> Hello Robert, I got my diagram ready. If you want, I can send it to you over my university mail and put my promotor, copromotor and assistant in CC.
[14:57:06] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:57:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just upload it to imgur and share the link? lol
[14:57:40] <Guy> Because you thought it was "phishy", hence why I wanted to add legitimacy to my request for help
[14:57:54] <Guy> https://i.imgur.com/MuWAtIM.png
[14:58:18] <robertmaxrees> that diagram doesn't make sense for your use case.
[14:58:45] <robertmaxrees> what url are you requesting the page from?
[14:59:01] <Guy> Which page?
[14:59:08] <robertmaxrees> the url in the browser.
[14:59:36] <Guy> wpo-edm.be/redirect/hln.be
[15:00:12] <Guy> the worker doesn't work right now, since I'm messing around with my redirect module
[15:00:24] <robertmaxrees> so the browser is going to your server, and the worker is then acting as a proxy to the newspaper site?
[15:00:36] <Guy> Yep
[15:00:43] <Guy> the worker extracts the hln.be bit
[15:00:59] <robertmaxrees> Okay, that's different from what I thought you were doing.
[15:01:19] <robertmaxrees> just for curiosity's sake, why are you trying to do this?
[15:01:56] <Guy> Because I need to test the edge worker for a handful of "real" websites to show it's validity in real life
[15:02:09] <robertmaxrees> erm, it's totally valid.
[15:02:26] <robertmaxrees> the use case you've cooked up is really unusual and not wha they're really for.
[15:02:28] <robertmaxrees> *what
[15:03:15] <Guy> Yea, that's why it is part of a thesis research. We are now pushing the boundry of web performance, see if we can use edge workers to make it do things like creating readermode webpages on the fly
[15:03:28] <Guy> And that for any webpage, without interference of the original developers of the website
[15:03:55] <Guy> It is to fit in later on in the MEC paradigm
[15:04:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can do that.  dunno why you're trying to make a proof of that.  cloudflare's workers are basically like service workers but on the edge cache.
[15:04:43] <Guy> Because my thesis isn't worth much if I don't have statistical data
[15:05:14] <robertmaxrees> either way
[15:05:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rmsyaejn/2/
[15:05:23] <robertmaxrees> you can very, easily do something like this.
[15:06:06] <Guy> let me get the implementation that I had
[15:06:22] <robertmaxrees> but the way you're trying to proof this is kind of odd.  i would create an actual site of your own, instead of trying to proxy to another site like this.
[15:07:26] <Guy> A site of my own is a controlled environment where I control the parameters. So my solution would be overfitting and only useable in my own use case
[15:07:47] <Guy> While websites in the wild use all kinds of oddities
[15:07:56] <Guy> Things I can't control
[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> sites in the wild aren't proxying like you're trying to here.
[15:08:12] <Guy> No, but the might use edge workers
[15:08:17] <Guy> Which I don't have access to
[15:08:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:08:28] <Guy> Which I don't have access to
[15:08:41] <robertmaxrees> your problem statement doesn't really make sense to me lol.
[15:10:04] <Guy> How do you mean?
[15:12:29] <Guy> What part is confusing?
[15:13:07] <robertmaxrees> youre working on spoofing another website.
[15:13:13] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea imo.
[15:13:35] <robertmaxrees> and not something people with legitimate use cases would really need to do.
[15:14:49] <Guy> I need to be able to test my edge worker with other websites. Since I don't have access to their infrastructure, I have to do it this way and simulate being their edge worker
[15:14:57] <Guy> My implementation: https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=2RxiF7nb41
[15:15:25] <robertmaxrees> and what i'm saying is that concept is flawed :)
[15:15:54] <Guy> How would you go about testing an edge worker for different websites that you don't control?
[15:16:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[15:17:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that use case is not a thing you'd do.
[15:19:25] <Guy> I do not have the time nor the resources to create 50 different websites that encompass different scenarios. Even then, edge cases will still be excluded if I did. This way, if it works, I can easily test a 100 pages automatically if I have to. (As long as I don't get rate limited by Cloudflare)
[15:20:27] <robertmaxrees> can the proxy edit things in flight?
[15:20:36] <Guy> Yes
[15:20:49] <Guy> Wait, define "in flight"
[15:21:27] <robertmaxrees> so traffic passing through the clouflare worker - can you edit what's coming through there?
[15:21:46] <Guy> Yes, but I'm limited to a 10ms time span in which all the editing has to occur
[15:21:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:22:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it sounds more and more like what you want to do is going to be real difficult to pull off.
[15:22:27] <robertmaxrees> since it's not really a use case you'd see in the real world.
[15:22:52] <Guy> I'm almost there though ^^ All the redirects already work, and the injected scripts do too. External libraries are a bit of a problem right now
[15:23:02] <Guy> Since JQuery is used often, I'm targetting that one
[15:23:20] <robertmaxrees> right - and you'll have to edit multiple libraries and frameworks.
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> which is a bad idea.
[15:23:29] <Guy> I will only do for JQuery
[15:23:33] <robertmaxrees> you'll also have to grapple with different versions.
[15:23:38] <Guy> Probably
[15:23:38] <robertmaxrees> it's just not a good idea :shrug:
[15:23:47] <robertmaxrees> especially if you're looking for somthing repeatable.
[15:24:41] <Guy> I do get your concern securitywise, since it can most likely be used for MITM attacks
[15:26:18] <robertmaxrees> if repeatability is a concern, this also assumes that the other site won't update.
[15:27:29] <Guy> The websites are allowed to update, all algorithms used are agnostic to the content
[15:27:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:27:51] <robertmaxrees> i give up :) maybe somebody else will help you though!
[15:29:15] <Guy> That's part of the challenge of the thesis ^^ Creating something that can be applied to anything that I throw at it.
[15:29:25] <Guy> Thanks for the help thoug
[15:29:32] <Guy> *though
[15:29:43] <Guy> You won't convince me, since my professor tasked me with this
[15:29:53] <Guy> So I either do this, or no thesis at all
[15:29:59] <robertmaxrees> your professor doesn't understand how the real world works :shrug:
[15:30:14] <Guy> What are your credentials to say that?
[15:31:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm a software engineering team lead and technical lead for a medium-large ecommerce company.  i've also spent consierable time google's engineering support team on site performance and new browser features, including service workers, amp, etc.
[15:32:58] <Guy> I see
[15:33:43] <Guy> My apologies, I have no clue who I am talking to in here
[15:33:49] <robertmaxrees> it's fine :)
[15:33:49] <Guy> So it was genuine curiosity
[15:34:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm just some random dude on the internet.  you don't know me from adam :)
[15:41:38] <Guy> Have you seen the fiddle that I sent you a bit ago?
[15:42:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry - really don't like togetherjs
[15:42:52] <robertmaxrees> and really, you want to test in the second arg is a string and if that string contains a url, or there was a single object passed and, if so, test the props of the object for urls.
[15:43:15] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not realy inclined to help you much more than that since the whole thing is gonna be pretty fragile and you'll want to come up with a solution.
[15:43:35] <robertmaxrees> also - you don't want to return return $.prototype.ogCSS(name, value);
[15:43:50] <Guy> I don't? Oh, I see
[15:43:59] <robertmaxrees> that returns the result of calling ogCSS - you want to clone ogCSS and then modify properties on it and return that.
[15:44:06] <robertmaxrees> have you read the plugin development guide?
[15:44:39] <Guy> I did not, no. I Checked out the repo and tried to base myself on the source code where I saw that CSS returned some values
[15:44:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you want to do at all.
[15:45:25] <Guy> So I figured that feeding CSS the modified values, and then returning the values that CSS returned, would be enough
[15:45:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:45:39] <robertmaxrees> you want to read up on http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/ - from "How to Create a Basic Plugin" on down.
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> and adapt that info to your basic concept here.
[15:45:50] <Guy> Thank you! I'll dive right into it
[15:59:38] <z1haze> is there a way to determine from the event if it was triggered manually or natively?
[15:59:56] <robertmaxrees> depends on the event.
[16:00:03] <z1haze> a change event for example
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> there are ways  though i generally advise against that kind of logic
[16:00:36] <z1haze> hah somehow i dont doubt that
[16:00:53] <robertmaxrees> :) are you using .trigger()?
[16:01:21] <z1haze> yeah
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> why not just directly call the function you want?
[16:03:14] <z1haze> my scenario is that I have a hidden 'id' field in a form that points to a stored address in the database, if a customer manually changes the fields themselves, i want to clear that 'id' field because it will tell me to create a new address. if i am programmatically updating those fields, i want to retain that 'id' field because i will just 'update' that database entry
[16:03:48] <z1haze> i guess i could use 'input' listener to clear it
[16:03:48] <robertmaxrees> not sure what that has to do with my question :)
[16:03:59] <z1haze> your question didnt make any sense
[16:04:22] <z1haze> try to have a bit more of an open mind
[16:04:27] <z1haze> everything isnt so black and white man
[16:04:28] <robertmaxrees> why do you care if it's a manual trigger vs. a normal browser event.
[16:04:34] <robertmaxrees> oh boy.
[16:04:39] <robertmaxrees> alright.  enjoy :)
[16:04:48] <z1haze> well, you daily pick apart everything i do
[16:05:46] <z1haze> i shouldnt have said that, so im sorry.
[17:37:52] <kawhiBaby02> hello?
