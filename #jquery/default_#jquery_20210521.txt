[00:32:48] <bboy> hello guys, I need some help in completing this task. I have created this table and I want to add sort element using pure jquery. please find it here: https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/1z2vjmnc/8/
[08:15:39] <auxin> I aim to use json to more easily store information about music on my desktop. I can't figure out how to use getJSON to organize information such that I can reference values of the data like data.song data.album data.comment etc.
[08:16:52] <auxin> I have a quick function from examples, that does nice things, but it only outputs everything to the console
[08:24:33] <auxin> oh, I was able to solve my problem.
[15:17:22] <kraucrow> thats awesome
[15:17:42] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:38:04] <Northwoods>  var frm = $(this).closest("form.stockfrm"); $('.instock').appendTo(frm); , does this append all checkboxes with class instock to form
[15:39:07] <Absolum> should
[15:39:32] <Absolum> not just checkboxes, but anything with class=instock
[15:39:46] <kraucrow> yeah
[15:40:30] <kraucrow> you should add type="checkbox" otherwise into selector
[15:41:11] <kraucrow> and frm is not used, so that makes little sense. btw.
[16:28:40] <Northwoods> THANKS
