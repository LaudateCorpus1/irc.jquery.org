[00:30:34] <carloratm> Hi all
[00:30:44] <carloratm> n00b question here
[00:31:17] <ravenzz> go ahead
[00:32:32] <carloratm> I have list with floating li, and I'd love to show a little zoom on li hover
[00:32:48] <carloratm> mmm I do not think zoom is the right word
[00:33:07] <carloratm> It is more like increasing width and height
[00:33:38] <carloratm> and the li must overlap
[00:34:17] <Alecoalec> Extremely "noob" question, $('#all_product:eq(1) [href]'); would that work to grab the first instance of all_product and spit out the href value?
[00:34:33] <ravenzz> carloratm you don't need js to do that
[00:35:10] <Alecoalec> isn't that z-index?
[00:36:12] <ravenzz> Alecoalec actually the ID must be unique in the page
[00:36:23] <ravenzz> so :eq(1) is not necessary
[00:36:36] <Alecoalec> I'm picking up from class
[00:36:42] <Alecoalec> no id
[00:37:48] <Alecoalec> ravenzz: jQuery('.all_product:first').attr('href');
[00:37:56] <ravenzz> in your example you select by ID :P
[00:38:08] <ravenzz> that
[00:38:38] <carloratm> ravenzz: thank you, z-index seems to be not enough
[00:39:02] <carloratm> position:absolute kinda work
[00:39:03] <ravenzz> Alecoalec or var $all_products = $('.all_product');
[00:39:50] <ravenzz> and then $all_produts.first().attr('href')
[00:40:02] <ravenzz> so that you can use $all_products later if you need it
[00:40:07] <Alecoalec> Ok
[00:40:10] <ravenzz> carloratm hold on
[00:40:12] <Alecoalec> Perfect thank you one more q
[00:40:27] <Alecoalec> What if all product is a div and inside it is the a element can I get that?
[00:40:34] <ravenzz> carloratm what browsers do you support?
[00:40:36] <carloratm> ravenzz: is there some web based playground to show you some code please?
[00:40:48] <ravenzz> carloratm sure jsfiddle.net or codepen.io
[00:40:54] <carloratm> thank you
[00:41:34] <ravenzz> Alecoalec yes, you should read the selectors page of the jQuery documentation
[00:41:42] <ravenzz> ?selectors @ Alecoalec
[00:41:43] <bot-t> Alecoalec, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[00:42:29] <ravenzz> and abount find()

[00:48:03] <petoo> HI
[00:48:25] <petoo> How do I check if a website exists?
[00:48:34] <Cork> a webite?
[00:48:43] <petoo> a server
[00:48:55] <petoo> just want to check if its up.
[00:49:09] <Cork> simplest would prob be to have a php script that pings/connects to it
[00:49:12] <ravenzz> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
[00:49:20] <Cork> ^ like that ya :)
[00:49:21] <carloratm> 09:48 < petoo> How do I check if a website exists?
[00:49:21] <carloratm> 09:48 < Cork> a webite?
[00:49:21] <carloratm> 09:48 < petoo> a server
[00:49:26] <carloratm> ops
[00:50:10] <Cork> donno why, but i took for granted that it was a coding question :)
[00:50:33] <ravenzz> don't overthink :P
[00:50:49] <petoo> yes it is
[00:51:06] <ravenzz> petoo that's not a jQuery related question
[00:51:07] <ravenzz> ask #web
[00:51:09] <ravenzz> :)
[00:51:21] <petoo> ravenzz: ?
[00:51:33] <ravenzz> petoo: !
[00:51:37] <Cork> petoo: so, if it was, then you need to do it from the server side
[00:51:46] <petoo> I want to do it using  jquery
[00:51:46] <Cork> as js can't do it
[00:51:54] <ravenzz> petoo you can't
[00:52:06] <Cork> or rather js can, but browsers will block you
[00:52:08] <aep> petoo: supporting any browser or just the decent ones?
[00:52:23] <ravenzz> or actually
[00:52:37] <Cork> aep: no browser will allow you to check a server you don't have control over
[00:52:38] <petoo> aep we don't allow IEs , everyone else is welcome
[00:52:48] <ravenzz> maybe you can attempt to load an image from that website
[00:53:01] <aep> petoo: http://caniuse.com/websockets
[00:53:07] <petoo> ok
[00:53:13] <ravenzz> and if it fails bam
[00:53:18] <ravenzz> it is down
[00:53:28] <petoo> ok, rather I check it on server side
[00:54:05] <ravenzz> like $('<img/>').on('error', function () { /* is down */ }).src('http://target.com/img.png');
[00:54:46] <Cork> /src\(/attr\('src',/
[00:54:55] <ravenzz> oops
[00:54:56] <ravenzz> yeah
[00:55:23] <Cork> but ya, that should actually work
[00:56:03] <Cork> though the server might block it
[00:56:38] <Cork> (as its been used to leak information from services)
[00:56:51] <ravenzz> mmm indeedw
[00:57:07] <ravenzz> it shouldn't block the favicon though
[00:57:21] <ravenzz> (i think)
[00:58:38] <ravenzz> a guy wrote a proof of concept that shows how to bypass hotlinking protections in js
[00:58:49] <ravenzz> (it works only on chrome I think)
[00:59:18] <ravenzz> to be honest I don't understand how it works but
[00:59:42] <ravenzz> why I would say
[01:00:13] <ravenzz> http://referrer-killer.googlecode.com/git/example.html
[01:00:49] <ravenzz> well of course it works because the referrer is not sent
[01:01:27] <carloratm> OT: http://jsfiddle.net/carloratm/ddhe6/1/ do I need some jquery here ?
[01:01:43] * carloratm can't make overlapping work  
[01:01:54] <ravenzz> carloratm I asked you. what browser do you support?
[01:02:33] <ravenzz> if the answer is IE9+ use the CSS3 transforms (scale)
[01:03:00] <ravenzz> or maybe you can use it anyway, and a polyfill for legacy browsers
[01:03:05] <carloratm> I am afraid it is not the answer
[01:04:28] <Cork> ravenzz: zoom fallback for old ie?
[01:12:55] <ravenzz> Cork maybe or just no zoom at all! graceful degradation..
[01:13:52] <Cork> ravenzz: btw have you heard about the new rendering engins?
[01:13:56] <ravenzz> the zoom thing is not that important imo, old browsers can fallback to a normal hover effect
[01:14:42] <ravenzz> oh yeah I read a few tweets this morning, but I haven't had the time to read the announcement
[01:14:49] <Cork> `g google blink
[01:14:49] <b-ot> Cork: Google Forks WebKit And Launches Blink, A New Rendering ... â†’ http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/google-forks-webkit-and-launches-blink-its-own-rendering-engine-that-will-soon-power-chrome-and-chromeos/

[01:14:54] <b-ot> Cork: mozilla/servo Â· GitHub â†’ https://github.com/mozilla/servo
[01:15:01] <ravenzz> will it be a fork of WebKit right?
[01:15:11] <Cork> ya, but a full fork
[01:15:21] <Cork> not just a separat working branch that synks
[01:15:24] <Cork> *syncs
[01:18:40] <eugenmayer> Hello. having this fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/ iam not able to get this kind of click delegation to work. Click on checkbox ( active class on tr ) + delegate every click on the tr to the checkbox. Any ideas?
[01:18:57] <eugenmayer> sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/63Eh8/
[01:18:58] <Andrew_R> eugenmayer: you have to click "save" first :)
[01:19:42] <Cork> eugenmayer: you don't have any delegation there
[01:20:10] <eugenmayer> Cork: i dont think .delegate will change the game, doesnt it?
[01:20:14] <Cork> eugenmayer: or do you mean triggering the click on the checkbox when the row is clicked?
[01:21:09] <eugenmayer> exactly, thats my intention. Its like the user should not be forced to click on the checkbox. But i guess, if i bind both, i get a double-event
[01:21:15] <Cork> eugenmayer: well your binding a lot of unnessesary event listeners the way you do it, but other then that no
[01:21:56] <ravenzz> Cork yeah, well at least opera will switch too and WebKit will be abandoned in few years maybe :P
[01:22:32] <Cork> eugenmayer: btw please don't use coffiescripted scripts when you ask for help
[01:22:33] <ravenzz> in favour of a faster and better rendering engine (that's seems to be the google's promise)
[01:26:00] <Cork> ravenzz: i actually prefer not to have too few engines
[01:26:11] <Cork> so i don't want fewer
[01:31:43] <Cork> eugenmayer: http://jsfiddle.net/63Eh8/2/
[01:33:02] <eugenmayer> Cork:  interesting. What about the approach just changing the checked state of the checkbox when the TR is clicked and also toggle the class there. You wouldnt advice that?
[01:33:29] <Cork> well you would get code duplication, but ya it works
[01:33:31] <eugenmayer> i mean basically what you did is stoping the default click handle on the checkbox in general
[01:33:49] <Cork> no, i stop the propagation
[01:33:52] <eugenmayer> hmm it rather looked shorter, let me sum this up
[01:33:52] <Cork> not the default action
[01:34:01] <eugenmayer> ah, so it does not bubble, right?
[01:34:05] <Cork> yes
[01:34:09] <Cork> else you get recurtion
[01:34:20] <Cork> recursion even
[01:34:31] <eugenmayer> Yeah, get that. Thank you!
[01:34:52] <Cork> np
[01:36:26] <eugenmayer> Cork: just in case : http://jsfiddle.net/63Eh8/3/
[01:36:46] <Cork> no
[01:36:51] <Cork> ?prop @ eugenmayer
[01:36:52] <bot-t> eugenmayer, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[01:37:04] <Cork> attr is for attributes, not properties
[01:37:40] <eugenmayer> ah, thats new to me
[01:37:54] <eugenmayer> i was stuck to 1.4 quiet q while. Thanks for the hint: corrected it to : http://jsfiddle.net/63Eh8/4/
[01:37:55] <Cork> if you use attr like that it breaks in some browsers
[01:38:30] <nights> hi guys
[01:38:47] <eugenmayer> how that example compares to your? For me, it looks a bit shorter , but maybe i miss an important point
[01:39:28] <nights> i get an error on my page because there is a jquery "on" function that is operating on a element that is not available until its loaded by the user. how can i add like a check if the element is available?
[01:39:35] <Cork> eugenmayer: it won't trigger the change/click event
[01:39:47] <Cork> eugenmayer: so if anything happens in an event bound it won't do anything
[01:39:54] <nights> this row: $("#menu_panel").on("click", ".menuitem_content", function(event)
[01:39:59] <sfdcNoob> Cork: How can I get effect in the menu bar as in this site http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/exclusive-ongoing-malware-attack-targeting-apache-hijacks-20000-sites/
[01:40:32] <Cork> nights: you mean the menu_panel doesn't exist?
[01:40:38] <eugenmayer> Cork: ok, get that. So its shorter but not very plugable for other contribs. And confusing in case. Right, good point
[01:40:40] <Alecoalec> Any way I can use a userscript to disable all jQuery fades from a website?
[01:40:46] <eugenmayer> Cork: once again, thank you !
[01:40:54] <Cork> eugenmayer: np
[01:41:07] <Andrew_R> nights: you can wrap that in a $(document).ready(function) so that your code doesn't get run until the dom is ready
[01:41:24] <nights> Cork: no the #menu_panel exist
[01:41:36] <nights> but the menuitem_content class doesnt
[01:41:48] <nights> to be honest i dont see why this is such a big deal
[01:41:49] <Cork> nights: shouldn't matter
[01:41:54] <nights> i thought that was the point of "on"
[01:41:57] <Cork> your using a delegated listener
[01:42:03] <nights> hm
[01:42:07] <nights> but chrome complains
[01:42:18] <Andrew_R> nights: I thought you meant #menu_panel didn't exist.
[01:42:24] <eugenmayer> Cork: if you allow, just a question. I expect that $('sel').on(event, function) is not the same as $.on('event','sel','function) ?
[01:42:44] <nights> Andrew_R: no, the #menu_panel is already loaded at that time
[01:42:51] <Cork> eugenmayer: the second is a delegated event listener
[01:42:54] <eugenmayer> Cork: or is it the same, but just better style to use it as a parameter
[01:43:09] <Cork> eugenmayer: that means it doesn't build a list of all the sel elements and add one event listener to each one
[01:43:17] <nights> Andrew_R: its already wrapped in a document ready
[01:43:20] <Andrew_R> do you get an error message?
[01:43:26] <Cork> eugenmayer: instead it binds on to the parent, and listens to bubbling events
[01:43:30] <nights> hm, to be honest im quite confused with chromes error tracing
[01:43:33] <eugenmayer> Cork: so the second one is kind of what we used to call "live" ?
[01:43:48] <Cork> eugenmayer: no the second one is the same as delegate
[01:43:49] <eugenmayer> i see
[01:43:59] <nights> when i load the page with the f12 debug window open the debugger stops at the line (that i pasted above)
[01:44:06] <Cork> eugenmayer: live always bind on document, and dose it in a horrible way
[01:44:09] <nights> im not sure where the error is displayed
[01:44:38] <nights> "TypeError"
[01:44:40] <nights> is all i can see
[01:44:41] <Cork> nights: the developer console
[01:44:48] <nights> "Object [object Object] has no method 'on'"
[01:45:25] <eugenmayer> thanks!
[01:45:35] <Cork> nights: sounds like $ isn't jquery
[01:45:45] <nights> what do you mean?
[01:46:14] <Andrew_R> nights: what version of jquery?
[01:46:15] <Cork> nights: in the console type $.fn.jquery
[01:46:26] <nights> $.fn.jquery
[01:46:26] <nights> "1.6.1"
[01:46:31] <nights> a bit old...
[01:46:37] <Andrew_R> too old for on
[01:46:46] <Cork> and if you run it as console.log($.fn.jquery) just before the erroring line?
[01:47:01] <Andrew_R> 1.7 is when it was added
[01:47:02] <Cork> no i think on was introduced in 1.5
[01:47:23] <Cork> nope
[01:47:25] <Andrew_R> ? on
[01:47:25] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:47:25] <Cork> remembered wrong
[01:47:34] <eugenmayer> Cork: the last thing i dont get is, how your example differes from my first one. I created a click event ( object ) and used "stopPropagation on that object, then triggered the event with trigger(e)
[01:48:00] <devnill> I have a selector I want to use against a block of html which is in a string. What would the syntax be to do this?
[01:48:43] <nights> Andrew_R: interesting, but it works....
[01:48:55] <nights> i think i might have loaded two versions
[01:49:07] <Andrew_R> nights: you'll have to upgrade jquery if you want to use .on(), otherwise you can use .delegate()
[01:49:08] <Cork> eugenmayer: honestly i just noticed that it didn't trigger the event handler
[01:49:32] <nights> Andrew_R: i'm succesfully using 'on' already, all of those on calls actually work
[01:49:38] <Cork> eugenmayer: i know it works with an event object though, but you need to do stuff with it (and i have forgotten what it was)
[01:50:04] <Cork> devnill: you can't match a string, you have to convert it to dom
[01:50:25] <Cork> devnill: var dom = $(string); dom.find(selector);
[01:50:43] <devnill> kk, thanks cork
[01:51:30] <Cork> nights: btw, you can use delegate in much older versions
[01:51:43] <devnill> oh, actually i just found filter
[01:51:48] <Cork> nights: it has a slightly different syntax to on
[01:52:03] <Cork> devnill: filter only check the top most elements
[01:52:12] <devnill> ah, that makes sense
[01:52:15] <Cork> (and find only checks the one with a parents)
[01:52:21] <Cork> -s
[01:52:25] <devnill> luckely thats actually all i need :)
[01:52:55] <Andrew_R> nights: I don't know what to tell you, http://jsfiddle.net/Mv7eb/ - .on() with 1.6.4 and I get a "$(...).on is not a function" error
[01:53:08] <nights> OK
[01:53:16] <nights> well, i think im loading two versions of jquery now
[01:53:23] <Cork> Andrew_R: http://jsfiddle.net/Mv7eb/1/
[01:53:26] <nights> one old one packed with my php framework
[01:53:31] <nights> and one i load in separately
[01:53:35] <nights> which is 1.9.1
[01:53:49] <nights> not the best idea
[01:53:52] <Cork> nights: don't run two frameworks
[01:54:00] <nights> so i will bite the bullet and upgrade the framework now
[01:54:03] <Cork> it causes a lot of nasty situations
[01:54:04] <nights> painful
[01:54:09] <nights> yes of course its a bad practise
[01:54:18] <Cork> Nightcinder: just use delegate and it should works just fine
[01:54:21] <Cork> opps
[01:54:23] <Cork> 'nights:
[01:54:26] <nights> i was very surprised to see i was running 1.6.1
[01:55:11] <Cork> well framework normally stay behind A LOT of the current upstream code
[01:55:29] <Andrew_R> there is a way you can run 2 versions of the framework, but it's not pretty
[01:56:48] <Cork> ya
[01:56:58] <Cork> and worst of all you get to load two frameworks
[01:57:08] <Cork> and thats quite a nasty overhead
[01:57:16] <nights> hm
[01:57:18] <nights> yeah
[01:57:30] <nights> though i dont understand why i get 1.6.1
[01:57:31] <Cork> (the size of an old development suite)
[01:57:44] <nights> i thought the new version would replace the old since i load it later
[01:57:51] <nights> yeah
[01:58:12] <nights> theres no question, reducing the number to one version is going to save a lot of trouble
[01:58:19] <nights> this is asking for trouble
[01:58:33] <Andrew_R> I think it checks for $ and doesn't overwrite it if it exists.
[01:59:02] <nights> Andrew_R: ah, interesting. but somehow i have the "
[01:59:07] <nights> "on" featrues
[01:59:11] <nights> *features
[01:59:24] <nights> and other >1.6.1 features
[01:59:51] <Cork> nights: looks like something is overwriting parts of jquery
[01:59:52] <Andrew_R> come back tomorrow when you are only using one framework and it still doesn't work :p
[01:59:58] <nights> hehe
[02:00:09] <nights> yeah, im sorry
[02:00:21] <nights> i didnt even know that much
[02:00:21] <Andrew_R> lol j/k
[02:00:33] <nights> :) im upgrading Yii now
[02:00:42] <nights> half a year since last time
[02:01:50] <Cork> nights: you could try noConflict see ?.noConflict
[02:01:51] <bot-t> nights, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[02:02:13] <Cork> though that mainly works for other frameworks
[02:02:22] <Cork> (as jquery still use jQuery)
[02:02:42] <Andrew_R> Cork: not if you pass true
[02:02:53] <Cork> true
[02:03:37] <Cork> heh i feel kinda eeky just talking about running two frameworks on the same site XD
[02:04:06] <Andrew_R> yeah I was just going to say, you don't really want 2 jquery's
[02:05:07] <nights> $.fn.jquery
[02:05:07] <nights> "1.8.3"
[02:05:07] <nights> yes
[02:05:12] <nights> :) things still work too
[02:05:14] <nights> excellent
[02:06:36] <Teza19> hi guys, i'm looking at incorporating a jquery slider on my site. where can i find a tutorial?
[02:06:57] <Cork> ?g jquery-ui slider
[02:06:58] <b-ot> Cork: Slider | jQuery UI â†’ http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[02:07:00] <bot-t> Cork, Slider | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[02:07:27] <Cork> theres examples at the top
[02:08:41] <portishead> is anyone familiar with zurb-foundation? I am getting this error:  TypeError: Result of expression 'this.settings.$topbar' [undefined] is not an object.
[02:08:43] <Teza19> thanking you!
[02:08:45] <Andrew_R> nights: you might want to take a look at these two pages in the "Removed Features" section, but there isn't much
[02:08:47] <Andrew_R> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[02:08:52] <Andrew_R> http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/
[02:09:41] <Cork> and might be worth to go for 1.9 when you're at it
[02:10:51] <nights> Cork, Andrew_R: no more problems after the upgrade
[02:11:04] <nights> seems like i have to stick to two versions for now though
[02:11:16] <Cork> :s
[02:11:29] <nights> 1.8.2 and 1.8.3 both used now
[02:11:58] <Teza19> Cork, I think I've been given the wrong information. Is this a slider --> http://www.juniper.net ? The rotating banner, specifically.
[02:12:24] <Cork> ah, a slideshow
[02:12:30] <Cork> slideshow != slider :)
[02:12:58] <Teza19> I was redirected here and was asked to ask about the "jquery slider"
[02:13:01] <Teza19> haha
[02:13:32] <Cork> there are several slideshow plugins
[02:13:38] <Cork> look around and pick on you like
[02:13:54] <nights> god
[02:13:55] <nights> yeah
[02:14:14] <nights> there are like a 3 digit number of jquery sliders/slideshows
[02:14:25] <daslicht> when i do something like this on a json file: JSON.stringify(vo)  i get Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON  in WebKit browsers ?!
[02:14:27] <nights> bootstrap one is pretty good
[02:14:28] <daslicht> in FF its working
[02:14:31] <Cork> no there isn't as many sliders
[02:14:32] <daslicht> idea why ?
[02:14:38] <Teza19> I haven't done a lot of jquery, so that's why I was a bit hesitant
[02:14:48] <nights> Cork: what do you mean sliders then?
[02:14:58] <Cork> daslicht: you have object pointers pointing to its parent
[02:15:11] <daslicht> what does that ,mean ?
[02:15:18] <daslicht> and how to fix it ?
[02:15:19] <Cork> daslicht: one sec
[02:15:20] <daslicht> please
[02:15:30] <Cork> nights: a slider is ex the jquery-ui slider
[02:15:59] <Cork> nights: the slideshows are those that flips elements/images/similar
[02:16:14] <daslicht> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9382167/serializing-object-that-contains-cyclic-object-value
[02:16:15] <daslicht> ?
[02:16:17] <daslicht> like this ?
[02:16:37] <Cork> daslicht: ex. var a = {}; a.b = {}; a.b.a = a;
[02:16:50] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a.b = {}; a.b.a = a; JSON.serialize(a);
[02:16:52] <daslicht> is that a bug ?
[02:16:54] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: JSON.serialize is not a function
[02:16:55] <Cork> no
[02:17:01] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a.b = {}; a.b.a = a; JSON.stringify(a);
[02:17:05] <bot-t> Cork: No output. (Process Killed)
[02:17:19] <Cork> daslicht: objects is javascript pointers
[02:17:33] <Cork> if you point a name to another object, you have two pointers to the same object
[02:17:55] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a.b = {}; a.b.a = a; a.b.a.test = 'woho'; a.test
[02:17:56] <bot-t> Cork: "woho"
[02:18:06] <Cork> and also
[02:18:17] <daslicht> let me paste something
[02:18:18] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a.b = {}; a.b.a = a; a.b.a.test = 'woho'; a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.b.a.test
[02:18:21] <bot-t> Cork: "woho"
[02:18:35] <Cork> and theres where you have the circular reference
[02:18:35] <daslicht> http://paste.ie/view/9cb21269
[02:18:37] <daslicht> i have this
[02:19:09] <Cork> the problem is most likely in value
[02:19:18] <daslicht> aha
[02:19:27] <daslicht> i understand
[02:19:35] <daslicht> what circular is :)
[02:19:36] <Cork> also
[02:19:39] <nights> mendokusai.
[02:19:40] <daslicht> first example was good
[02:19:53] <Cork> i also recommed changing data: 'JSONFile=' + JSON.stringify(vo), to data: { JSONFile: JSON.stringify(vo) },
[02:20:11] <Cork> else you might get encoding problems
[02:20:52] <daslicht> ok fine , i just took it from saome example, i did not knew that i neeed to stringify a json at all :)
[02:20:56] <daslicht> i try
[02:21:11] <Cork> daslicht: you don't
[02:21:18] <daslicht> no?
[02:21:20] <Cork> but it will be sent as params to the server if you don't
[02:21:28] <daslicht> but I cant access it on teh server side in that case
[02:21:37] <Cork> sure you can
[02:21:42] <Cork> but not as json :)
[02:21:48] <daslicht> i see
[02:21:54] <Cork> how depends on what language
[02:21:59] <daslicht> php
[02:22:07] <daslicht> symfony2
[02:22:31] <Andrew_R> $_POST['id'], $_POST['target'], $_POST['value'] - or if symfony has a special way of getting the POST vars
[02:22:43] <Cork> ex { key: [1,2,3,4,5] } becomes $_POST['key'][0 - 4]
[02:22:44] <Andrew_R> that's if you do: data: vo,
[02:23:14] <Andrew_R> what is "value" ?
[02:23:18] <portishead> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'find' of undefined foundation.topbar.js:183, anyone familiar with this?
[02:23:21] <daslicht> i triied it like this , the values are null
[02:23:53] <daslicht> target is something like username and value is something like John :)
[02:24:07] <Cork> daslicht: then itt sounds like something is messing with it server side
[02:24:16] <Cork> itt=it
[02:24:44] <Andrew_R> use firebug, the developer console or something like fiddler to inspect the ajax request and view the POST data
[02:24:49] <daslicht> so is sending a json no good idea ?
[02:25:07] <Cork> it is if you have complex structures
[02:25:35] <Cork> but for three values, no its not needed
[02:26:35] <Cork> daslicht: the console should show something like id=<id>&target=<target_id>&value=<value>
[02:27:05] <Cork> cause that is what should be sent to the server (automatically) by $.ajax if you give it vo
[02:27:07] <daslicht> I be right back, I try now that  data: {JSONFile: JSON.stringify(vo)},
[02:28:16] <Andrew_R> (I thought he was having problems with JSON.stringify(vo)?)
[02:28:42] <Cork> ya, that too
[02:29:11] <Andrew_R> that doesn't make sense looking at this code though, unless value really isn't just a name.
[02:29:22] <Cork> exactly
[02:29:31] <Cork> (said so a while back) :)
[02:29:53] <rs-dev> Hey guys, I've the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/e65e9/  After adding ?callback=? $.ajax peforms only get requests. How can I fix that?
[02:30:17] <Cork> rs-dev: jsonp can only be get
[02:30:54] <Cork> jsonp uses <script src="target"> to access data from third party domains
[02:31:06] <Cork> and a script tag can only do get requests
[02:31:53] <rs-dev> Cork: Thanks for your explanation.
[02:32:15] <Cork> yw
[02:33:03] <Andrew_R> rs-dev: maybe you can proxy your request through a server side call on your own domain?
[02:34:14] <rs-dev> Andrew_R: Thanks for your idea!
[02:34:27] <Andrew_R> np :)
[02:38:53] <daslicht> i think i found the circularity and fixed it
[02:39:03] <daslicht> now I just need to get that new data line working :)
[02:39:40] <daslicht> JSONFile	{"id":1,"target":"firstname","value":"test"}
[02:39:44] <daslicht> looks great like this
[02:39:45] <daslicht> ?
[02:40:05] <Cork> no need for JSONFile
[02:40:08] <daslicht> are double quotes valiud json ?
[02:40:16] <Cork> yes
[02:40:21] <Cork> they have to be for a valid json
[02:40:23] <daslicht> data: {JSONFile: JSON.stringify(vo)},
[02:40:28] <daslicht> not good?
[02:40:37] <Cork> lol if you want to send json; yes it is
[02:40:51] <Cork> lol if you want to send json; yes it is
[02:40:53] <Cork> opps
[02:40:58] <Cork> * but its not really necessary
[02:41:07] <daslicht> why ?
[02:41:08] <Cork> (stupid up arrow)
[02:41:26] <Cork> daslicht: its just three key - value pares
[02:41:36] <Cork> and its more efficient to send that as params
[02:41:45] <daslicht> ok i just did it to learn how it works
[02:41:51] <daslicht> in case i do more things in future
[02:41:52] <daslicht> :)
[02:42:00] <daslicht> i thought it could be good practice
[02:42:34] <Cork> json becomes   JSONFile=%7B%22id%22%3A1%2C%22target%22%3A%22firstname%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22test%22%7D
[02:43:34] <Cork> while params becomes id=1&target=firstname&value=test
[02:44:13] <Cork> daslicht: json is good if you need deep nesting values
[02:44:20] <Cork> else, its a waist of space
[02:44:54] <daslicht> ok
[02:44:57] <daslicht> thank you !
[02:45:06] <Cork> np
[02:45:21] <daslicht> so i juist can leave out the data and send the values as query stroing
[02:45:30] <daslicht> :)
[02:45:31] <Cork> yes
[02:45:37] <daslicht> k
[02:45:49] <daslicht> i do it :) now i know how to handle json :)
[02:45:51] <Cork> and by leave out the data i mean
[02:45:54] <Cork> data: vo,
[02:46:12] <Cork> don't add it to the url :)
[02:46:46] <raj> is there a js/jq library that allows me to work with filepaths/names
[02:47:00] <Cork> split?
[02:47:06] <Cork> or do you mean to actually list them?
[02:47:13] <raj> additional plus would be if it could check to make sure strings are posix safe
[02:47:28] <raj> Cork, basically a library that takes split to the next level
[02:48:01] <nights> what do you want from a library that you cant just write in a few lines?
[02:49:07] <Cork> raj: http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/parseuri ?
[02:49:19] <raj> a library that could clean potential dangers, such as ../../
[02:49:20] <Cork> http://medialize.github.com/URI.js/ ?
[02:49:27] <raj> a library that could clean potential dangers, such as ../../etc/passwd
[02:49:35] <Cork> raj: you should NEVER implement security in js
[02:49:44] <raj> https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/parseUri
[02:49:45] <Cork> you can't ever trust it to be safe
[02:49:51] <raj> Cork, I do it serverside as well
[02:50:18] <raj> but might as well have two layers of security if there's already a library
[02:50:47] <Cork> wow
[02:50:54] <Cork> URI.js looks neet
[02:51:05] <Cork> raj: i actually think it can do what you want http://medialize.github.com/URI.js/docs.html
[02:51:29] <daslicht> so when I do : data : vo , teh values are added to the url automatically?
[02:51:41] <Cork> daslicht: if its a get call yes
[02:51:47] <daslicht> cool
[02:51:48] <Cork> else its params encoded post values
[02:51:55] <daslicht> so i can keep my vo structure ion the client :)
[02:52:25] <Cork> raj: http://medialize.github.com/URI.js/docs.html#normalize-path
[02:53:02] <raj> Cork, that would allow for the danger to occur
[02:53:25] <Cork> raj: not really, as it actaully converts the resulting string
[02:53:42] <Cork> you will get a converted url that you can check isn't "outside allowed path"
[02:54:09] <raj> hmm
[02:54:10] <daslicht> and          dataType: 'json', ?
[02:54:11] <Cork> its things like /var/www/allowed/path/../../../../etc/passwd thats scary
[02:54:16] <daslicht> just remove that ?
[02:54:19] <Cork> daslicht: its what you expect back
[02:54:25] <Cork> doesn't matter for data:
[02:54:28] <daslicht> ok
[02:54:30] <daslicht> thanks
[02:55:02] <Andrew_R> raj: what are you doing that you are accepting user input and converting it to a file path?
[02:55:13] <raj> Cork, I decided to just send my server a weird filename that I can basically dissect into the filenames I'm looking for
[02:55:24] <raj> and then zip
[02:55:30] <Cork> Andrew_R: i guess he wants a quick ui response to have infront of the backend
[02:55:39] <raj> and return that to the user for download
[02:55:42] <raj> that should work, no?
[02:55:43] <Cork> and that sounds correct
[02:56:07] <Cork> raj: uh, why not just have the server send the file back?
[02:56:18] <Cork> no need to have a path solution at all
[02:56:20] <raj> the file, being the zip file?
[02:56:40] <Cork> ya, but the server can take a filename or id or what ever
[02:56:41] <raj> oh, because not all files are in the same directory
[02:56:45] <Cork> and then pick it from there
[02:57:03] <Andrew_R> how does the user know which file they want?
[02:57:06] <Cork> x-sendfile  FTW :)
[02:57:08] <daslicht> working like a charm :)0
[02:57:43] <raj> Andrew_R, what do you mean?
[02:58:06] <raj> they are checkboxing them
[02:58:41] <Andrew_R> instead of using the filename in the checkbox value, use an ID
[02:58:53] <raj> hmm
[02:59:00] <raj> good idea
[02:59:02] <Andrew_R> do you have the filenames in a database or something?
[02:59:06] <raj> yes
[02:59:19] <raj> i already have their id as well
[02:59:27] <raj> very nice, thanks Andrew_R
[02:59:40] <Andrew_R> add the path/filename to the database table and get it based off the id
[02:59:42] <Andrew_R> much more secure
[03:00:04] <raj> i don't wanna add it explicitly though
[03:00:13] <raj> in case it changes
[03:00:31] <Andrew_R> you could hard code it I suppose
[03:00:53] <raj> there is another table that has that info though
[03:00:55] <Cork> or have a url and a path section
[03:01:02] <Cork> and the url becomes constant
[03:01:02] <petoo> hi
[03:01:03] <raj> would it be crazy to check another table for that?
[03:01:04] <Andrew_R> usually it's easier to make a change to the database than to change code
[03:01:16] <Cork> ya
[03:01:25] <Andrew_R> not crazy
[03:01:27] <raj> really?
[03:01:29] <Andrew_R> if the id's match
[03:01:34] <Andrew_R> do a join
[03:01:39] <Cork> raj: many times
[03:01:41] <raj> well, it's a foreignkey
[03:01:49] <raj> Cork, what's many times?
[03:02:14] <Cork> raj: easier to change it in the database then in the code
[03:02:43] <Cork> raj: and sql is quick to do lookups, so as long as you can do it in the query it should be fine
[03:02:45] <Andrew_R> if you already have the filenames in a table, hard coding it could make those values out of sync if you change the filenames
[03:03:06] <Andrew_R> you'd have to change both locations
[03:03:14] <petoo> I am trying to call an ajax function. Once user fills in required information, as soon as he goes to other field or submit button I need to call this ajax , how to accomplish this?
[03:03:14] <raj> hmm
[03:03:21] <raj> Cork, fwiw, is this idea better than the frames idea?
[03:03:42] <Cork> raj: frames?
[03:03:52] <Cork> i don't see what that have to do with it
[03:03:55] <raj> we were talking about using a frame to allow this to occur
[03:04:08] <Cork> sure, but that was about doing multiple requests
[03:04:14] <Cork> not about how to get the files
[03:04:39] <Andrew_R> ? post @ petoo
[03:04:40] <bot-t> petoo, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[03:04:45] <raj> oh, for real?
[03:04:54] <raj> I thought it was about allowing a zip to be downloaded
[03:04:57] <Cork> Andrew_R: no file download requests
[03:05:07] <Cork> raj: no not specifically
[03:05:24] <raj> ok good thing my parents started flipping out
[03:05:29] <raj> and I had to leave!
[03:05:42] <raj> i woulda implemented something totally different than I intended
[03:05:54] <Cork> lol
[03:06:15] <Andrew_R> petoo: or if you are looking at how to capture an event after leaving a specific field, look at .blur()
[03:06:20] <Cork> raj: the iframe thing was about requesting a bunch of downloads async without getting separate tabs
[03:06:54] <Cork> so it has very little to do with what we're talking about now
[03:07:54] <petoo> Andrew_R: ok
[03:09:59] <raj> why in the world would I use http://medialize.github.com/URI.js/jquery-uri-plugin.html as a jq plugin vs standalone?
[03:10:03] <raj> I don't see any advantage
[03:10:40] <Andrew_R> raj: it's always bad practice to take input from user's (or input that could be manipulated) and use it directly as a filepath. Even if you try to sanitize input, there's a chance it something could get through.
[03:11:06] <raj> I agree
[03:11:13] <Andrew_R> if you didn't have jquery on a page, it would make sense to use URI.js in it's standalone mode
[03:11:22] <raj> I have jq
[03:11:36] <raj> so why would I use the jq version instead?
[03:11:52] <Andrew_R> yeah but someone else might not be using it.
[03:12:05] <Cork> raj: it lets you modify attr through the uri.js commands
[03:12:25] <raj> useless :(
[03:12:36] <Cork> ex $a.hash('#new-hash')
[03:12:55] <Andrew_R> that's one of the only plugins I've seen that gives you the option to run as a regular jquery plugin or standalone
[03:13:09] <raj> it can be done backwards anyway Cork
[03:13:13] <Cork> i've seen plenty
[03:13:15] <raj> for the standalone version
[03:13:18] <Cork> raj: sure
[03:13:31] <Cork> and the plugin just adds a few accessors to $.fn
[03:13:38] <Andrew_R> it's a good idea
[03:13:43] <Cork> it is basically just the standalone anyway
[03:13:58] <Cork> ya, the more i read about it the more i like that plugin
[03:14:20] <Cork> especially things like $a.attr('uri:domain') == 'google.com';
[03:15:01] <Cork> oooh...
[03:15:08] <Cork> $('a:uri(is: relative)');
[03:15:09] <Cork> :D
[03:15:17] <Andrew_R> $('a:uri(suffix = pdf)');
[03:15:27] <Cork> ya
[03:15:35] <seutje> u could do that with a regular old css selector
[03:15:48] <Cork> seutje: to some degree ya
[03:16:03] <raj> why can I only  do EITHER URI.fragmentQuery.js OR URI.fragmentURI.js ? http://medialize.github.com/URI.js/build.html
[03:17:06] <Cork> raj: the implementations most likely isn't compatible, or overlap
[03:17:53] <Cork> ah, ya
[03:18:00] <Cork> both uses the hash tag
[03:18:02] <Andrew_R> seutje: possibly, but $('a:uri(suffix = php)');  will match <a href="myfile.php?index=1> where $('a[href$=php]') wont
[03:18:05] <Cork> so they conflict
[03:18:28] <Cork> and href*=".php" ?
[03:18:34] <Cork> Andrew_R: ^
[03:18:48] <Andrew_R> bad practice? lol
[03:18:54] <Cork> sure
[03:19:04] <Cork> never said it was good, but we where talking about possible :)
[03:19:41] <Cork> and i didn't think of it for styling
[03:19:52] <Cork> i thought of it for selectors (delegated actually)
[03:24:29] <Andrew_R> so it's agreed, any questions about "how do I get [the query string|the hash]?" get directly to URI.js :)
[03:24:43] <Andrew_R> *directed
[03:25:34] <Cork> well that or ##javascript
[03:34:34] <romka> helllo, i know this is not php nor regex chat
[03:34:38] <romka> but please help
[03:34:39] <romka> preg_match('([0-9\.]+)', 'Bill Pilczuk (USA)22.29', $match) and $match returns: Array (  [0] => 160 )
[03:34:49] <romka> can't understand it :'(
[03:35:11] <Cork> romka: try ##php
[03:36:04] <WesleyL> it gives me 22.29 just fine, romka
[03:37:15] <Andrew_R> ##php doesn't know anything about regex
[03:38:36] <Cork> ##php is mostly a bunch of flamers
[03:43:13] <sacho> then try #regex
[03:44:33] <KrizOne> hi everyone, is there a way to use timeStamp without an event? i wanted to call a function and then inside the function it figure out the current time stamp, is this possible?
[03:52:42] <Andrew_R> is it bad practice to extend $ to store an array and a couple functions rather than using the "Revealing Module Pattern", like this: http://jsfiddle.net/elijahmanor/CDDer/15/
[03:55:39] <mrgt> Have a contenteditable div. On keyup I have console.log($(this).html()); but sometimes I get "foo&nbsp;" is there a way I can remove this? http://pastebin.com/8MYsKQND
[04:00:34] <Andrew_R> mrgt: I think that is normal when you hit a space.
[04:01:20] <Cork> well at least if its two spaces in a row
[04:01:35] <Cork> (or at the end of a line)
[04:02:05] <Andrew_R> I'd do a html decode on the server and then a trim. (assuming this content is being sent to the server to save it)
[04:08:03] <drager> I have a "bbcode inserter" and now when I press the buttons it works fine, the tags gets into the textfield but if I select the text and presses a button the tag will come at the end of the text not around it; http://jsfiddle.net/4Kzxh/1/
[04:10:17] <Cork> drager: ya, who would return oldValue + start + end; be able to do anything else?
[04:10:29] <Cork> *how
[04:11:00] <drager> Cork: Yeah, so how should I do?
[04:11:19] <Cork> drager: you would have to extract the selection area in the textarea
[04:11:30] <Cork> then replace it with the wrapped content
[04:12:31] <Cork> ?g mdn textarea
[04:12:32] <b-ot> Cork: <textarea> - HTML | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/HTML_Elements/textarea
[04:12:33] <bot-t> Cork, <textarea> - HTML | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/HTML_Elements/textarea
[04:12:41] <Cork> drager: check the selectionEnd/Start section
[04:14:52] <drager> Cork: hm
[04:16:56] <daslicht> i have a event listener like this: $(document).on('click','.edit_button',function(){});
[04:17:00] <daslicht> its doing nothing
[04:17:22] <daslicht> the current browserr url is : localhist/user#profile
[04:17:27] <Cork> and the .edit_button class is set on the element?
[04:17:42] <daslicht> yes
[04:17:50] <Cork> ?p @ daslicht
[04:17:50] <bot-t> daslicht, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:18:13] <daslicht> if i now klick that button , the pages gets refreshed and the url gtes updated : localhost/user?#user
[04:18:30] <daslicht> dont get me wriong , the on is working as it shoudl
[04:18:47] <Andrew_R> daslicht: you need to do a .preventDefault()
[04:18:48] <daslicht> the question is why does the page gtes reloaded and the url is chnaged ?
[04:19:08] <daslicht> let me try
[04:19:18] <Cork> lol
[04:19:31] <Cork> missed a simple one i see >_<
[04:20:32] <daslicht> but why do i need to prevent the default ?
[04:20:44] <daslicht> teh default of a button is not to refresh the page
[04:20:49] <daslicht> its NO A HREF
[04:20:57] <Cork> daslicht: else the button is prob in a form
[04:21:03] <Cork> and it triggers a submit on it
[04:21:05] <daslicht> ahhhhh
[04:21:08] <daslicht> uuuuu
[04:21:08] <Andrew_R> :)
[04:21:09] <daslicht> ooohh
[04:21:20] <daslicht> lol
[04:21:44] <daslicht> funny is that its working in ff withoiut preventDefaults
[04:24:33] <Anticom> hi all
[04:25:10] <Anticom> on an input field that causes the sourrounding form to be submitted when field is focused and return key is pressed, what event do i have to catch, to prevent the submission of the form? keypress, keydown, keyup?
[04:25:38] <Cork> ?.submit @ Anticom
[04:25:38] <bot-t> Anticom, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[04:25:46] <Anticom> Cork ?
[04:25:50] <Anticom> what you want to tell me with that?
[04:25:51] <daslicht> thank you
[04:25:59] <Anticom> read my question
[04:26:19] <Cork> Anticom: the event order is form.submit > input field.keyup
[04:26:20] <Andrew_R> don't try to prevent the form submission by capture the event on the button, do it at the form.submit() level
[04:26:23] <Anticom> i know how e.preventDefault() works... i just want to know on what event i have to listen
[04:26:26] <Cork> you can't prevent the submit from the input field
[04:26:39] <Cork> submit doesn't bubble from the input field
[04:26:43] <Anticom> Andrew_R no one is talking about a button click
[04:27:01] <Andrew_R> or enter keypress, same thing
[04:27:38] <Cork> Anticom: the point is that submit is special, it doesn't follow the normal event chain order
[04:27:38] <Anticom> so what should i do if i do want the form to be submitted when submit button is pressed but not on return key in input fields?
[04:27:49] <Anticom> submit is a bitch haha :D
[04:28:43] <Cork> Anticom: well as you don't have the form behavior, sounds like you shouldn't be using a form
[04:28:51] <Cork> *don't want to have
[04:29:01] <Anticom> not exactly
[04:29:17] <Anticom> there's a button that causes an ajax call to load some kind of preview
[04:29:26] <Anticom> and then lateron in the process i want the form to be submitted
[04:29:29] <Cork> Anticom: how a form submit triggers depends on the browser, and it is tricky fiddling with it
[04:29:34] <Cork> cause it easily breaks
[04:29:38] <Anticom> but when the user presses return key the form get's submitted directly
[04:29:53] <Anticom> and i don't want this to happen
[04:30:44] <Cork> Anticom: you could set a value in a click event on the button
[04:30:59] <Cork> and unless it's set, you abort the ajax call
[04:31:13] <Anticom> hm i think u didn't quite get the use case
[04:31:22] <Anticom> i've got a form containing various fields for filtering the results
[04:31:35] <Anticom> then you can load a preview, to check what the applied filter options deliver
[04:31:38] <Cork> Anticom: you missing the answer
[04:31:47] <Cork> the input fields events trigger AFTER the form
[04:31:53] <Cork> you can't block it from the input fields
[04:32:19] <Cork> so you have to look for other solutions
[04:32:30] <Anticom> well is there a way to prevent form submission in generall?
[04:32:33] <sahbeewah> You can do this: set e.preventDefault on the form. put a click handler on the submit button which removes the submit handler, and programmatically submit it using the button
[04:32:55] <Cork> Anticom: $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[04:33:00] <Anticom> can i do $('#myForm').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault; }
[04:33:05] <Anticom> Cork cheers
[04:33:30] <Cork> and then in the submit event check if things are in a state where you want to do the submit
[04:33:47] <Cork> ex. check if the "preview" has been accepted or something
[04:33:55] <Cork> and if not don't do the ajax call
[04:33:59] <Cork> or what ever you want to do
[04:34:10] <Anticom> well, i'm going to do something like  [...]function(e) { if(myGlobalVal) { e.preventDefault(); }}
[04:34:25] <Anticom> it's not about preventing the ajax call Cork :D
[04:34:29] <Cork> first is the form going to be submitted like a normal form?
[04:34:35] <Cork> ok
[04:34:41] <Cork> you can't do it like that
[04:34:45] <Anticom> why?
[04:34:53] <drager> Cork: I'm not getting anywhere I believe; http://jsfiddle.net/4Kzxh/2/
[04:34:58] <Cork> cause preventDefault() need to happen at the top
[04:35:10] <Anticom> but it's just wrapped in a simple condition?!
[04:35:13] <Anticom> why shouldn't that work?
[04:35:17] <Anticom> ._.
[04:35:35] <Cork> do $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); ... if(myGlobalVal() { this.submit(); } }) /* and YES no $() around this */
[04:35:57] <Anticom> but this.submit() will trigger the custom handler again, won'
[04:35:58] <Cork> Anticom: cause it is a bit racy, and there is an easy way to make it not racy :) ^
[04:36:00] <Anticom> won't it? *
[04:36:03] <Cork> no
[04:36:08] <Cork> it will not trigger event listeners
[04:36:13] <Anticom> oh that's why i didn't got it
[04:36:19] <Anticom> wrong assumption
[04:36:21] <Cork> thats why no $() is so important
[04:36:22] <Anticom> ok now i know what u mean
[04:36:30] <Anticom> oki doki :)
[04:36:38] <Anticom> time for a coffee and then some jq raging :D
[04:36:39] <Anticom> cheers
[04:38:12] <seutje> jQuery.fn.rage
[04:38:23] <Cork> :D
[04:39:48] <Cork> jquery.fn.rage = function() { var victim = $('*'), target = Math.random(victim.length); victim.eq(target).remove() };
[04:39:50] <Cork> :)
[04:39:50] <seutje> https://github.com/jimmycuadra/rage/blob/master/src/jquery.rage.coffee lol
[04:39:52] <Sackyboy> hi guys! can someone help me with a jquery and "fancybox"-plugin question? i can't get this plugin to work, cause my other plugin (a grid-wallpaper) doesnt seem to get along with it. plz xhexk out this webpage and try the two first images in the background... can someone help me to figure this out?
[04:40:01] <Sackyboy> http://web.comhem.se/thatite/
[04:40:12] <Cork> opps
[04:40:13] <seutje> also found a jquery plugin for creating rage comics, but it looks like the page was deleted :(
[04:40:15] <Cork> jquery.rage = function() { var victim = $('*'), target = Math.random(victim.length); victim.eq(target).remove() };
[04:41:03] <Cork> that would be similar to psdoom :)
[04:41:46] <drager> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4Kzxh/3/
[04:41:59] <sahbeewah> Cork, I've never experienced a race condition with submit
[04:42:08] <sahbeewah> preventDefault does not "need to be on top"
[04:42:44] <Cork> sahbeewah: depends on the browser, but i know older versions of firefox fired the submit if you didn't prevent it at the top
[04:43:04] <seutje> $.fn.rage = function() { return this.each(function() { if (!Math.round(Math.random())) { $(this).remove(); } }); }
[04:43:15] <aasd> heloo
[04:43:22] <Cork> drager: you need to insert it on the position it was
[04:43:23] <seutje> so u can $('*').rage() :P
[04:44:29] <seutje> lol, so that fails
[04:44:37] <seutje> it remove <html> first :P
[04:44:41] <seutje> removed*
[04:44:58] <seutje> so all following calls were ran on elements that didn't even exist anymore
[04:46:16] <drager> Cork: Hm, like how?
[04:48:45] <drager> Cork: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/4Kzxh/4/
[04:49:32] <Cork> drager: one sec let me hack a bit
[04:49:47] <drager> Cork: Alright
[04:51:31] <Cork> drager: http://jsfiddle.net/4Kzxh/5/
[04:53:51] <drager> Cork: Cool, thanks!
[04:54:03] <Cork> np
[05:10:36] <ezio> the function here is not executing
[05:10:38] <ezio> $('.pagination').on('click', 'li', function()
[05:10:59] <ezio> i have two divs with class pagination
[05:11:03] <Cork> you mean $('.pagination').on('click', 'li', function() {}); ?
[05:11:05] <ezio> and they both have several li
[05:11:27] <ezio> i truncated the {} if that's what you mean
[05:11:38] <ezio> just for this chat
[05:11:44] <ezio> but i do have a body for that function
[05:11:49] <Cork> well it makes the difference between a declaration and a function call
[05:11:49] <ezio> i didn't want to copy multiple lines
[05:12:01] <Cork> sure
[05:12:30] <Cork> anyway does the pagination element exist when your selector runs?
[05:13:14] <Teh-Master> hey.. im using jqueryui's dialog function to open a dialog when a select box is set to "1", this is working fine but i guess when a dialog is called it moves it out of the <form> object it was previously in, so i tried the whole parent().appentTo('#formid'), when i do this it acts like a form 'submit' which is activating RSV(to validate input on the original form)
[05:13:30] <ezio> yes that was it because i was selecting the wrong div ... i was selecting the inner one that gets created after
[05:14:13] <ezio> k working now
[05:14:14] <ezio> thanks
[05:14:23] <Cork> Teh-Master: ya, dialog is hosted in the body by default
[05:15:03] <Teh-Master> i understand that, but any reason an appendTo would trigger a submit? theres absolutly nothing in the code to activate a submit except the single submit button in the form
[05:15:09] <Cork> Teh-Master: try setting appendTo in the dialog call
[05:15:19] <Cork> ah sorry missunderstood the question
[05:15:23] <Teh-Master> i did, in the open function
[05:15:26] <Cork> well it has buttons
[05:15:36] <Cork> and when you click then it propagates to the form
[05:15:44] <Cork> btw why do you want the dialog in the form?
[05:16:00] <Teh-Master> because the data needs to be submitted with that form
[05:16:04] <Teh-Master> its a sub-set of data
[05:16:06] <Cork> aha
[05:16:18] <Teh-Master> the buttons in the dialog are coded for: $( this ).dialog( "close" );
[05:16:29] <Cork> an option might be to move it back when closing the dialog
[05:16:30] <Teh-Master> not submitting so.. im confused as to why its happenings
[05:17:05] <Cork> Teh-Master: you misunderstood
[05:17:17] <Cork> jquery ui buttons (that dialog uses) is <button>
[05:17:28] <Teh-Master> ah
[05:17:30] <Cork> default action for <button> in a form is submit
[05:17:44] <Teh-Master> certainly makes sense now
[05:18:23] <Teh-Master> so.. i even tried the appendto in the close of the dialog (which in theory would be after the button is called) and that had the same effect
[05:18:55] <Cork> i actually think close is called synchronously
[05:19:05] <Cork> so that would be at the end of click
[05:19:07] <Cork> :)
[05:19:10] <Teh-Master> ah
[05:19:47] <Cork> Teh-Master: if you call destroy in close does it move the element back to its original position?
[05:19:56] * Cork doesn't remember
[05:20:12] <Cork> Teh-Master: also if you move the content instead of the entire dialog it shouldn't be a problem
[05:21:18] <Teh-Master> didn't appear to in my last test, but i didn't go far on that because destroying it would mean they couldn't open it again
[05:21:44] <Teh-Master> what would be the best way to move the content?
[05:23:05] <Teh-Master> while still allowing the dialog to reopen
[05:25:13] <Anticom> Cork to emulate this.submit i could do $('#myform').get()[0].submit(); instead aswell, can't i?
[05:27:43] <seutje> why the get?
[05:28:42] <seutje> Anticom: u can already address it as an array $('#myform')[0].submit()
[05:29:16] <Anticom> it's about wether it should handle registered handlers for submit event
[05:29:30] <Anticom> if i do it without get jq will jump in, won't it?
[05:29:47] <seutje> nope
[05:29:58] <seutje> $('#myform').submit() <- now jq will jump in
[05:30:37] <seutje> if u address a certain element in the jquery collection/array, it's just the DOM node ur talking to, it's not a jquery object
[05:36:30] <daslicht> hi, i return a rendered temaple form my symfony2 backend json encoded back to the client
[05:36:37] <daslicht> the return value looks like this:
[05:36:37] <daslicht> http://pastie.org/7313552
[05:37:10] <daslicht> i do get that value when i do a  console.log(response)
[05:37:29] <daslicht> now i like to add the returned html to the dom and read the status code
[05:37:46] <daslicht> i tried it with response.status but i get undefined ?
[05:38:08] <daslicht> thats how i send :  $.post(_form.attr('action'), _form.serialize(), function (response) {
[05:38:23] <daslicht> do i neeed to specify the return value as json ?
[05:40:24] <ezio> if i preload images by just $('<img/>').src = image_url ... how do i get those preloaded images
[05:40:32] <ezio> just create an img with the same src?
[05:40:51] <sqwk> How can I get the width of an option inside a select? I would like to shrink-wrap the select on change.
[05:41:38] <Cork> Anticom: $('#myform')[0].submit() yes
[05:42:00] <Cork> Anticom: or $('#myform').get(0).submit() if you prefer that
[05:42:17] <Cork> ezio: yes
[05:42:30] <Cork> preloading just means getting the browser to store them in cache
[05:42:47] <Anticom> got it working now
[05:43:08] <Cork> sqwk: options don't have that information cross browsers
[05:43:41] <Anticom> i never got why ppl use .post() ...
[05:43:48] <ezio> Cork, ty
[05:44:26] <Cork> Anticom: in simple cases it makes it easier to read then hunt for the type: in the option object
[05:44:35] <Cork> but ya, i don't ever use i either
[05:44:52] <Anticom> i don't have any simple cases lol
[05:44:53] <Teh-Master> alrite, so i'm trying to copy that dialog content to a hidden div within the form.. simply trying $(this).html().. the input appears empty though
[05:44:53] <Anticom> jk
[05:46:18] <Cork> Teh-Master: no meed to copy it
[05:46:45] <Cork> Teh-Master: but, first does dialog.dialog('destroy') return the elements to its original position?
[05:47:00] <Cork> (just so we don't reinvent the wheel)
[05:48:14] <Teh-Master> no it doesn't
[05:48:23] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[05:48:25] <daslicht> anticom me neitehr , i just reused existing code, i have replaced it noew with ajax and it works like a charm :)
[05:48:37] <Teh-Master> its still at the end of the body
[05:52:50] <masentinel900> Someone could tell me how can I to do a foreach loop on jquery?
[05:54:02] <VernonK> masentinel900 On a jQuery object?
[05:54:23] <VernonK> $(".selector").each(function(i) { â€¦ });
[05:54:28] <Cork> ?.each @ masentinel900
[05:54:28] <bot-t> masentinel900, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:54:58] <daslicht> I <3 JavaScript
[05:55:46] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/adhvr/
[05:55:48] <masentinel900> I have that
[05:56:34] <masentinel900> So I need to do that function by each one record stored in the data variable
[05:57:26] <Cork> Teh-Master: http://jsfiddle.net/MEPeV/1/
[05:58:35] <masentinel900> .each will work ok for my affair?
[05:58:55] <Cork> masentinel900: read the documentation linked
[05:59:14] <masentinel900> Ok
[06:02:24] <Teh-Master> Cork that worked, only issue now would be reopening the dialog with the same content
[06:02:48] <Cork> Teh-Master: not really, just run the dialog on it again
[06:02:58] <Cork> but why do you want to open the dialog again?
[06:03:12] <Teh-Master> because the data may need to be edited
[06:03:17] <Cork> (and if you do destroying the old one sounds like a bad idea :) )
[06:03:53] <Teh-Master> thats why i was trying to initially copy the data using .html
[06:05:44] <foofoobar> Hi. How can I set the canvas width to 100% with jquery?
[06:05:52] <foofoobar> (100% of the current parent element)
[06:06:04] <Cork> Teh-Master: when you serialize to html you lose the state of the dom element
[06:07:35] <Anticom> foofoobar .css() ?
[06:07:54] <foofoobar> Anticom, thats not the same as the width="" and height="" attribute
[06:08:08] <Anticom> foofoobar ok then i'm out :D
[06:08:17] <Anticom> didn't take a look at canvas yet
[06:08:20] <foofoobar> if I set it by css, it is affected after the page is loaded, so something which is drawn in the canvas is not affected after this
[06:08:47] <Anticom> foofoobar n why don't u draw it after resizing the canvas?
[06:09:10] <foofoobar> Anticom, so calling .css() in js and the drawing it?
[06:09:24] <Anticom> foofoobar worth a try i'd say
[06:11:01] <foofoobar> Nothing happens :/
[06:11:07] <daslicht> is there something like $("#edit_form").reset() ?
[06:11:30] <foofoobar> using .attr('width', '12345') works
[06:11:37] <foofoobar> but then I cant't use '100%'
[06:23:22] <WillPittenger> Is it possible to call .post from within the response handler for a second call to .post?  See the simplified code at http://pastebin.com/3zSHqUZ2.
[06:23:55] <WillPittenger> All I know is that my Tomcat never sees the second call.
[06:24:52] <Anticom> WillPittenger jsonp?
[06:25:06] <WillPittenger> ????
[06:25:10] <WillPittenger> I don't understand you.
[06:25:14] <Anticom> http://google.com
[06:26:12] <WillPittenger> Actually, the outer servlet returns XML.  The inner one returns just a string.
[06:26:34] <WillPittenger> I don't use JSON at this time.
[06:27:26] <WesleyL> should work, WillPittenger
[06:29:14] <Cork> WillPittenger: you close the post function too early, other then that it should work
[06:29:27] <WillPittenger> ???
[06:29:54] <WillPittenger> With the inner one, I don't always care about the response.
[06:32:58] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/5fXCh/
[06:33:04] <masentinel900> I have this!!
[06:34:08] <masentinel900> But I need for each one record stored on data variable, show me one pnotify window!
[06:36:16] <VernonK> masentinel900 I think this is what you're looking for: http://jsfiddle.net/5fXCh/1/
[06:37:30] <masentinel900> But show me invalid 'in' operand obj
[06:37:38] <masentinel900> In the log error console
[06:38:08] <VernonK> What version of jQuery are you using?
[06:38:32] <masentinel900> 1.9.1
[06:39:38] <WillPittenger> Cork: ????
[06:40:08] <Cork> WillPittenger: $.post(url, function() { $.post() })
[06:40:22] <WillPittenger> So?
[06:40:23] <Cork> $.post(), function() doesn't parse
[06:40:36] <Cork> (and thats what your code does)
[06:40:51] <WillPittenger> Oh.
[06:40:57] <WillPittenger> Bad sample then.
[06:41:19] <masentinel900> VernonK: What do you believe is wrong?
[06:41:25] <VernonK> The 'in' issue is probably because your `data` is not an object.  Log the value of data and see what you get.
[06:42:06] <WillPittenger> Cork: The actual code has it's syntax checked by NetBeans.  I know that's right.
[06:42:22] <masentinel900> data is data is theresult of a php function
[06:42:28] <masentinel900> the result*
[06:43:45] <Cork> WillPittenger: as long as the syntax is correct that should work just fine
[06:44:00] <WillPittenger> :\
[06:44:52] <WillPittenger> Trouble is that Tomcat won't even tell me about a bad URL.
[06:46:23] <WillPittenger> It is like the inner .post never happens.
[06:46:50] <Cork> WillPittenger: can you paste the real code?
[06:47:04] <WillPittenger> Well, yes and no.
[06:47:10] <WillPittenger> There is a lot of code.
[06:47:29] <WillPittenger> Without the servlet (hosted by my local machine), you don't have much.
[06:47:31] <Cork> well the post call should be all that matters
[06:48:13] <WillPittenger> http://pastebin.com/nzZmKa8B << Inner call.
[06:48:36] <WillPittenger> genes/admin should map to the servlet /genes/admin.
[06:49:01] <WillPittenger> I know the statement is hit.
[06:49:08] <Cork> WillPittenger: have you verified that the first call succeeds?
[06:49:33] <WillPittenger> The outer one?  Yes.  No problems there.  That has been working for some time.
[06:49:45] <Cork> and its success callback is called?
[06:50:08] <Cork> (just cause you get the data server side doens't mean it succeeds)
[06:50:36] <VernonK> masentinel900 I understand that.  I'm just wondering what it looks like inside the body of that success handler.
[06:50:50] <WillPittenger> cork: Yes.  I stepped though it in the debugger.  It creates some HTML based on the response.
[06:51:21] <Cork> WillPittenger: and do you get the second post in the browser network console?
[06:51:54] <WillPittenger> I don't follow you.
[06:52:14] <WillPittenger> Firebug lists timeouts for the inner call.
[06:52:14] <masentinel900> <VernonK>: I don't understand you the last msg
[06:52:26] <masentinel900> What do you need to see!
[06:52:35] <Cork> WillPittenger: lists timeouts?
[06:52:47] <Cork> so the call happens but the server doesn't answer?
[06:52:55] <WillPittenger> Basically, yes.
[06:53:05] <WillPittenger> Same server.
[06:53:05] <Cork> so its a server code problem
[06:53:32] <WillPittenger> Tell that to Tomcat.  It should at least acknowledge receipt of the request.
[06:53:40] <Cork> if the post happens but the server doesn't answer, there isn't much jquery can do about it
[06:54:09] <VernonK> masentinel900 why are you sending an empty object to the server?
[06:54:10] <seutje> we need jQuery.server
[06:54:32] <seutje> close the loop n tings
[06:54:51] <Cork> seutje: node.js you mean?
[06:55:11] <seutje> that just javascript server
[06:55:14] <VernonK> masentinel900 what I was wondering is what does `data` actually look like in your success handler. (e.g. function(data) { console.log(data); } );
[06:55:14] <seutje> it has no $$ man!
[06:55:26] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/rYbvqACG
[06:55:28] <seutje> gotsa have them benjis
[06:55:33] <masentinel900> Is that!
[06:55:36] <Cork> seutje: just load jquery in it :)
[06:55:45] <seutje> :|
[06:55:50] <seutje> I CAN DO THAT IN APACHE
[06:55:52] <seutje> :P]
[06:56:06] <seutje> sry, getting rly frustrated over these fusioncharts
[06:56:11] <masentinel900> VernonK: That is where provide the data variable to html
[06:56:18] <seutje> half their docs are just... lying
[06:57:04] <VernonK> masentinel900 is that in response to the empty object question?
[06:57:51] <masentinel900> So, What I should to do?
[06:58:01] <masentinel900> I need to set that object from the controller
[06:58:10] <masentinel900> $data = "Something";
[06:58:18] <masentinel900> And like this send it
[06:59:05] <seutje> also, these docs don't seem to have any notion of what the defaults are
[06:59:31] <VernonK> masentinel900 what does this give you in your console: $.post("tareas/onLoadContent",{	}, function(data) { console.log(data); });
[07:01:21] <masentinel900> [09:01:05.756] <b>You donÂ´t have tasks for today</b><b>You donÂ´t have tasks for today</b><b>You donÂ´t have tasks for today</b>
[07:05:20] <masentinel900> VernonK: It show me exactly the result from the controller
[07:05:34] <masentinel900> But like this is well?
[07:05:52] <masentinel900> Or I should to set in a var?
[07:07:32] <VernonK> masentinel900 right but see how it's returning an HTML snippet?  jQuery seems to be having a problem with the for..in loop.
[07:07:55] <VernonK> That's not what you want anyway though because the iterator is literally going to go over each "character" in the response string.
[07:08:59] <masentinel900> So, What do you suggest me for may to solve this?
[07:10:07] <VernonK> If you set your response to return more of an actual JSON Object rather than HTML you should be able to do a $.parseJSON(data) to get an actual object to iterate over.
[07:10:37] <VernonK> The response string would need to be valid JSON though (e.g. double-quotes around properties and values)
[07:14:24] <VernonK> Basically set up each message you want to send as a value to a key.  Then in your success handler set a var jsonData = $.parseJSON(data); and then you could do your $.each(jsonData, function(index,value) { â€¦ }); iteration.
[07:28:59] <bobinator60> is datatables the best table system for jquery?
[07:30:57] <VernonK> I haven't seen much better.
[07:30:57] <Anticom> datatables bobinator60 ?
[07:31:05] <bobinator60> http://datatables.net/
[07:31:50] <Anticom> bobinator60 depends on your needs
[07:32:04] <bobinator60> thanks for stating the obvious :)
[07:32:55] <Anticom> bobinator60 anyway i like flexgrid aswell ( http://flexigrid.info/ )
[07:33:10] <bobinator60> thanks for that, i'll check it out

[07:39:22] <hooloovoo> lars_: do you get a error in safari?
[07:39:59] <Anticom> btw bobinator60 if you need more widgets and want them to be in kind of the same style i'd recommend http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxgrid/index.htm?%28classic%29#demos/jqxgrid/defaultfunctionality.htm
[07:40:08] <Anticom> they've got a powerful grid aswell
[07:40:10] <lars_> nope
[07:40:58] <lars_>  $.getJSON("url",  function(data) {          y = data.a;         y1= data.b;         y2= data.c;         y3= data.d; very simple getjson but ONLY work with file:/// and firefox
[07:41:09] <Anticom> lars_ http://jsfiddle.net
[07:41:45] <lars_> maybe jquery outdated?

[07:59:26] <bobinator60> Anticom i'm good for now

[07:59:36] <Anticom> happy coding :)
[08:03:02] <NeoMatrixJR> question for anyone who may be able to help: using jQuery + validation plugin in MS SharePoint 2010. Validation is working fine for a textbox but not on a textarea (generated with <sharepoint:inputformtextbox [options]> tag
[08:03:28] <NeoMatrixJR> rules are required and minlength 50

[08:06:01] <gmclelland> Can someone show me how I can replace .on with .bind to lower this script's requirements to work with jquery 1.4.4? See this code https://github.com/claviska/jquery-dropdown/blob/master/jquery.dropdown.js#L118
[08:08:03] <zoned> i've got a "drop" event set up on an element. is there something inside of the "event" argument it takes in that gives me info on the "from element" which was dropped onto this target?
[08:08:16] <Pal-an> @BillCriswell.....data/jsonFile.json......
[08:08:34] <Pal-an> local folder name
[08:08:52] <dcherman> gmclelland: see ?delegate

[08:09:00] <BillCriswell> Pal-an: Are you running a local server or just loading an html file up in the browser basically?
[08:09:47] <Pal-an> basic html file
[08:10:21] <Pal-an> it will act as $.ajax or any thing depending
[08:11:02] <Pal-an> It's not showing any error and first up all not triggering the function
[08:12:54] <murr4y> hi, should i use .prop() or .attr() to disable a <button>?
[08:13:11] <dcherman> murr4y: .prop
[08:13:19] <murr4y> all right, thanks
[08:13:26] <gmclelland> thanks dcherman - checking it out now
[08:15:58] <ladislaw> what is the proper way to achive this? $('<form class="one">')+$('.dropdown-toggle')+('....').appendTo(c);
[08:16:18] <ladislaw> I'd like to append only once
[08:17:30] <ladislaw> if you notice the one in middle which is getting an element already in the page
[08:17:47] <ladislaw> i'm trying to concatenate all three

[08:20:47] <ladislaw> 3rd part being $('<li>...').append...
[08:21:03] <alibama> hi folks - rather new to jquery - taking the alt tag from an image and using it in a div above the image - do I use the .ready event?
[08:21:15] <Brodingo> ladislaw you can chain another .add()
[08:25:23] <benet_> anybody knows how to adjust the autocomplete width ?
[08:27:03] <raj> would using .split() and .splice() each 10x be faster or doing a db query?

[08:31:00] <masentinel900> In the modal window I'm getting [Object Object]
[08:31:09] <masentinel900> Why?
[08:34:52] <steve111> Hi, I am trying to move a div element to a specific position via jquery's .css property. However its not working. Can anyone please check whats the error? http://jsfiddle.net/anBP3/1/
[08:35:55] <raj> masentinel900, use console.log(somevar) instead of alert(somevar)
[08:36:18] <zoned> el.on("drop", function(e) { // how do i get access to the "dropped" element here ???
[08:36:30] <raj> steve111, it needs a position absolute as well to do that
[08:36:46] <raj> otherwise it's position static
[08:37:33] <raj> oh, my bad
[08:37:34] <raj> you have that
[08:37:40] <raj> it's your TOPFIXEDMENU selector
[08:37:55] <raj> oh, no, not that either
[08:37:57] <jughead4> hi
[08:38:17] <masentinel900> raj: But do you where tell me?
[08:38:25] <raj> oh, steve111, you didn't include jquery
[08:38:29] <masentinel900> Because I'm not using an alert function
[08:38:43] <raj> in jsfiddle
[08:38:51] <maxmoore14> I'm having trouble with a cross domain request - http://jsbin.com/equfit/1/edit
[08:38:51] <raj> ^^ steve111
[08:39:14] <maxmoore14> when I use the code as is, it works
[08:39:21] <steve111> raj, oh yes
[08:39:26] <sandropadin> Need to include jQuery as a library in JSFiddle
[08:39:32] <jughead4> has anyone used photoswipe ? http://www.photoswipe.com/
[08:39:32] <maxmoore14> but when I switch the url to the commented one, I get status 0
[08:39:33] <raj> maxmoore14, i think ajax is not allowed cross domain for security issues
[08:39:41] <maxmoore14> raj: it is
[08:39:45] <maxmoore14> CORS
[08:40:17] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any way to have the identifier of an object used dynamic? For example: var x = 'width'; $(this).css({ x: '200px' });
[08:41:07] <maxmoore14> how can I see what exactly is failing in the ajax request to give it status 0?
[08:41:12] <maxmoore14> not sure how to debug that
[08:41:20] <raj> maxmoore14, crossDomain option is false by default
[08:41:46] <DeltaHeavy> maxmoore14: 'ajax' has the 'fail' method with a parameter for the error message.
[08:42:14] <Kogs> can I ask jQuery UI questions in here? cause I will. I'm trying to put a 'cancel' element on a sortable the way you would do it on a draggable (I have a class that I don't want activating a drag), but it's not working as expeted, any ideas>
[08:42:37] <sandropadin> @maxmoore14: var opts = {}; opts['width'] = '200px'; $(this).css(opts);
[08:42:38] <raj> maxmoore14, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#crossDomain
[08:43:15] <sandropadin> whoops. that last one was for @DeltaHeavy
[08:43:56] <DeltaHeavy> sandropadin: Ok thanks
[08:44:13] <maxmoore14> raj: "default: false for same-domain requests, true for cross-domain requests"

[08:46:44] <DavidScherer> Can anyone take a peek at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15814222/determing-collapse-state-of-bootstrap-collapse-able-element ?
[08:47:30] <DavidScherer> The collapse is collapsing when it's already hidden, and i call .collapse('hide') or when it's shown and I call .collapse('show') it shows.
[08:47:49] <DavidScherer> I've set .collapse({toggle: false}) to no effect,
[08:48:19] <maxmoore14> DeltaHeavy: the error message is just error
[08:48:23] <masentinel900> This is the result of console.log()
[08:48:23] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/JFaA3dYm
[08:49:03] <DeltaHeavy> maxmahem: What error message?
[08:49:55] <sam-> hi
[08:50:29] <maxmoore14> DeltaHeavy: from the fail method
[08:50:58] <sam-> hey has anyone onse used photoswipe ? http://www.photoswipe.com/ ?
[08:51:21] <DeltaHeavy> maxmahem: Are you using it correctly as shown in the docs?
[08:51:36] <sam-> im trying to use photoswipe with jquery zoom http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom/ kinda stuck on how to use both plugins together
[08:51:56] <maxmoore14> DeltaHeavy: yes
[08:52:22] <DeltaHeavy> maxmahem: It won't show any errors you might have on the server side. It'll only show errors in the exchange with the server.
[08:53:32] <maxmoore14> DeltaHeavy: I understand. What I am saying is that it doesn't seem to be attempting to try the server at all. It throws a status 0 error with textStatus = 'error' and errorThrown = ''
[08:53:56] <maxmoore14> not sure how I can debug that
[08:54:18] <steve111> raj, hey its still now working on including the jquery http://jsfiddle.net/eFWUD/4/
[08:54:19] <DeltaHeavy> What do your developer tools say?

[08:57:21] <fission6> can i read values in a table using jquery / js where the table is inside an ifraem
[08:58:10] <maxmoore14> DeltaHeavy: well, actually, I just checked it out with fiddler. It is making the request to the server. The server is responding with a 401, which is what it should be doing. So everything looks correct until it gets to the error handler.
[08:58:40] <steve111> raj, not sure what I missed
[08:59:42] <raj> steve111, the '#' before the TOPFIXEDMENU selector
[09:00:45] <steve111> raj, oh, ok! That was silly, thanks :)
[09:01:10] <maxmoore14> I updated with the raw response http://jsbin.com/equfit/1/edit
[09:02:55] <fission6> can i read an iframes content with jquery
[09:03:16] <maxmoore14> how is jquery turning a 401 error into 0?
[09:03:20] <esas> fission6: contents()
[09:03:27] <esas> w8, ill double check
[09:04:20] <esas> fission6: yeah, $('iframe').contents()
[09:04:30] <fission6> different origin
[09:04:33] <maxmoore14> DeltaHeavy: what do you think?

[09:13:35] <daslicht> that doesnt load
[09:13:51] <daslicht> ok ok ok so i have to do it manually ?
[09:13:53] <Assimilater> you could use $.ajax instead of load
[09:13:57] <daslicht> ok
[09:13:58] <daslicht> hehe
[09:14:05] <daslicht> and therer we go
[09:14:13] <daslicht> its the same as post and ajax :)
[09:14:28] <daslicht> thanks
[09:14:38] <Assimilater> i mean you could do other fancy things like $('<div></div>').load() but really $.ajax is cleaner :)
[09:16:21] <daslicht> yeah
[09:16:29] <daslicht> and you only have to remember one syntax
[09:16:30] <daslicht> hahah
[09:16:36] <daslicht> instead of thousand helpres

[10:05:34] <alibama> what am i missing?
[10:07:22] <alibama> do i need to wrap it all in a function or should it just be something like $('img').before('<div class="tata"></div>');
[10:09:22] <alibama> am new to query, so i'm not sure if my mistakes are syntax, methods, etc...
[10:13:09] <alibama> but this has to be a fairly basic questionâ€¦ anyone?
[10:17:22] <alibama> buellerâ€¦ bueller
[10:26:06] <codacoder> hello world
[10:26:22] <codacoder> question about jQ context arg
[10:26:50] <codacoder> what does jQ use if no context is supplied?  html? body?
[10:28:14] <alibama> 914 folks in a channel and no one's home ;)  ah well, ferris's day off apparently :)
[10:28:37] <codacoder> thought I'd arrived on an alien planet
[10:30:17] <codacoder> nvm
[10:30:18] <Phoenixz> On Jquery mobile, how can I hide the entire page until all CSS has finished loading? Right now, when I load from a remote server, I see lots of ugly HTML (The menu panel, the page, etc) all without CSS, and then "poof", it snaps into place as the mobile site
[10:30:22] <alibama> codacoder: no - it's nap time in planet jquery
[10:30:28] <codacoder> lol
[10:30:37] <alibama> i'm a total newb, so not much use i'm afraid
[10:30:41] <Phoenixz> I'd like it just to either show white until all is ready, or a loader image or whatever, not this ugly..
[10:31:00] <alibama> Phoenixz: i think .ready is your event
[10:31:19] <codacoder> call that a FUC
[10:31:42] <codacoder> "flash of unstyled content"
[10:33:01] <Phoenixz> alibama: from what I've gathered, that would be for normal pages (normal jquery if you wish), not mobile.. I'd have to use mobileinit or page init.. Even so, how could I use that? Can I simply do body display:none until that ready event and then $(body).show() or something?
[10:34:10] <codacoder> Phoenix: I do that (but not on mobile) and it works for me
[10:39:32] <zeropx> is there a way to bind something before another listener?
[10:39:59] <codacoder> do you know the other listener? can you call off on it?
[10:40:16] <zeropx> I got the code source, so I suppose I can yeah
[10:40:48] <codacoder> sounds as tho your logic is a bit whacked but...
[10:41:14] <zeropx> basically an .change() is set already and I want to have my change act before
[10:41:27] <codacoder> you could call off, call on for the new thing, then reattach the offed one with on again
[10:41:34] <zeropx> I am working with script that I don't have access to change rather I am piggy backing on it and trying to make needed adjustments to have an outcome
[10:41:47] <codacoder> me too ;)
[10:41:55] <zeropx> Ahehe
[10:41:55] <codacoder> fun init ;)
[10:42:04] <zeropx> oh yesâ€¦ sigh
[10:42:08] <codacoder> quite a challenge
[10:42:10] * zeropx smash face into wall.
[10:42:30] <zeropx> You know what though, you learn a lot of cool tricks trying to figure these unique situations out.
[10:42:34] <codacoder> yep - leads to some tangled logic
[10:42:45] <codacoder> ABSOLUTELY
[10:43:02] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how I can replace these two replace methods with one? .replace(/^(\s+)?(0+)?\ ?/, '').replace(/\s0$/, '');
[10:43:05] <codacoder> learned a ton doing this
[10:43:10] <DeltaHeavy> Any other criticism are welcomed.
[10:43:40] <codacoder> regex... codacoder ducks out of site ;)
[10:44:09] <zeropx> codacoder: thanks, I'm going to go try that method out.
[10:44:19] <codacoder> np
[10:44:20] <zeropx> HAHA
[10:44:22] <zeropx> NOPE
[10:44:26] <zeropx> jquery 1.4.4
[10:44:26] <zeropx> :P
[10:44:46] <zeropx> on is not an option. â€¦
[10:44:48] <zeropx> :p
[10:44:58] <codacoder> oh sh1t
[10:45:20] <zeropx> screw it, going to go old school hacking methods now.  I don't care about quality of code at this point LOL.
[10:45:29] <codacoder> well, wasn't there an unbind? and do you have namespacing in place?
[10:45:59] <zeropx> namespacing is in place, but adding another library/updated version would be difficult on this situation.
[10:46:08] <zeropx> its an older version of Drupal website
[10:46:19] <zeropx> with out a jquery update on it
[10:46:27] <zeropx> And all of this is tied in fun like,
[10:46:44] <codacoder> maaan - sounds bad
[10:51:27] <bsdbofh> Hey all, is something like this a valid way to remove a div? $(this).data('taskId').remove();
[10:51:48] <bsdbofh> Basically, I have the ID of the DIV stored in $(this).data('taskId')
[10:52:08] <bsdbofh> and so I want to .remove() the value stored in $(this).data('taskId')
[10:53:00] <codacoder> removeData removes data
[10:53:13] <Andrew_R> ah man, DeltaHeavy left and I have his solution ready for him...
[10:53:39] <Andrew_R> yay DeltaHeavy is back :)
[10:53:54] <Andrew_R> DeltaHeavy: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/HX4A4/
[10:53:55] <DeltaHeavy> Andrew_R: Yus, internet connection dropped D:
[10:54:23] <DeltaHeavy> Andrew_R: Awesome, thanks!
[10:54:33] <bsdbofh> codacoder, I'm trying to remove the div entirely, along with it's contents.
[10:54:46] <Andrew_R> np :)
[10:54:56] <codacoder> codacoder tags Andrew_R as "regex whiz" - oh boy is he gonna be sorry ;)
[10:54:58] <bsdbofh> but $(this).data('taskId')).remove(); doesn't appear to be working. I'm thinking because of the multiple . 's
[10:55:42] <codacoder> bsdbofh: you have one too many ")"
[10:55:52] <bsdbofh> ignore the extra ) hehe, my fault on pasting
[10:55:56] <bsdbofh> I was trying something like.. $($(this).data('taskId')).remove();
[10:56:00] <bsdbofh> to wrap it
[10:56:02] <codacoder> removeData removes data
[10:56:23] <codacoder> http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[10:56:23] <bsdbofh> so you think $(this).data('taskId').removeData(); would work?
[10:56:42] <bsdbofh> reading
[10:56:42] <codacoder> it does what it says it does - that means "work" right?
[10:57:17] <codacoder> dont think it will remove an element tho
[10:57:21] <bsdbofh> ah, well, i'm not looking to remove the data, I'm looking to remove the div element from the page
[10:57:46] <bsdbofh> yeah, removeData() will just remove my div ID value in that data
[10:58:07] <bsdbofh> the div's ID is stored in $(this).data('taskId')
[10:58:10] <codacoder> so... $($(this).data(stuff)).remove()
[10:58:15] <bsdbofh> yeah, ok
[10:58:21] <bsdbofh> I thought that may be it.
[10:58:27] <bsdbofh> giving that a try
[10:59:11] <nicetry> Hello, I'm using bootstrap and I want to use jquery to change the size of a div by changing its 'span' class.  I wanted to do something like $('#myclass').removeClass('span*');  then add the span that I want in there, but it wont' accept the wildcard
[10:59:28] <nicetry> is there a better way to do this?
[10:59:55] <bsdbofh> hmm, didn't work.
[11:00:05] <bsdbofh> div remains in place
[11:00:20] <codacoder> did u prove that you're getting the ID? did you add "#" up front?
[11:02:51] <Andrew_R> nicetry: there is no wildcard for .removeClass(classname), however if you call $('#myclass').removeClass() it will remove all the classes
[11:02:54] <Andrew_R> does that help?
[11:03:57] <nicetry> Andrew_R: That could work, thank you - but is there any way to.... say ... get any classes that start with span?
[11:04:31] <codacoder> nicetry: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5111272/selecting-classes-using-wildcard-not-exact-class-name
[11:04:38] <codacoder> not checked
[11:06:12] <Andrew_R> nicetry: maybe something like $('#myclass').removeClass(function(index,class) { return /^span/.match(class); });
[11:06:40] <nicetry> mmm
[11:06:56] <nicetry> I'll play with those, thanks for your help again.
[11:08:40] <RobinJ> how do i bind a function to a click event in dynamically generated content?
[11:09:57] <RobinJ> the documentation says on, stack overflow says live (deprecated) or bind. none actually work
[11:11:33] <JFranks> Does accordian(); have some glitch where it adds a hidden/blank <a> or am I right in saying something wasn't implemented properly in the 'Learn More' accordian setup on http://www.smartimage.com/ ? ... if you look just after the H3 that holds that <a>, there's a second copy with a blank target?
[11:11:59] <JFranks> It's not in the page source so it looks like someone did some sloppy implementing of jQuery?
[11:12:25] <Andrew_R> nicetry: this works: http://jsfiddle.net/LwVu9/
[11:14:40] <Andrew_R> hmm.. maybe not, if you add a second class to #myclass, it passes both into the callback as c
[11:14:56] <Andrew_R> c = "span1 test"
[11:15:07] <Andrew_R> but that might help you figure it out anyway
[11:15:25] <nicetry> mmm
[11:16:22] <nicetry> Andrew_R: lets say I go with your first suggestion.  I have <div class="foo span7">   Then I could do       $('.foo').removeClass().addClass('foo').addClass('span12');
[11:16:40] <nicetry> the only problem would be switching back to span7, so I'd need a way to store that....
[11:16:42] <Andrew_R> yes
[11:17:53] <portishead> hey guys, I am having problems with the dialog
[11:18:09] <pachet> the trick is to read it out loud
[11:18:54] <nicetry> can I use .attr to grab the current classes maybe...
[11:19:31] <pachet> nicetry: i just joined, what are you trying to do :[
[11:20:29] <nicetry> patchet: play with changing the span size (span class) of a div (using bootstrap)
[11:21:21] <pachet> ho
[11:21:23] <pachet> ...oh
[11:21:34] <pachet> yeah, i'd just grab .attr('class')
[11:21:37] <Andrew_R> nicetry: http://jsfiddle.net/LwVu9/1/
[11:22:12] <nicetry> Andrew_R: nice!
[11:22:50] <Andrew_R> do you have to remember your original span* classes?
[11:27:09] <nicetry> Andrew_R: yes
[11:27:46] <nicetry> it's too bad removeClass doesn't return what it removed, that would be neat
[11:31:32] <bobinator60> well, i tried DataTable.net and it is terrible!
[11:31:45] <Z3R0> anyone familiar with BlockUI having a slight problem :9
[11:31:49] <bobinator60> it throws exception all over the place.
[11:32:19] <bobinator60> it doesnt work easly  on variable-lenght column tables
[11:32:45] <bobinator60> it won't work on an empty table -- you have to have the columns already set up
[11:32:53] <Andrew_R> nicetry: I have another idea for you: http://jsfiddle.net/LwVu9/2/
[11:34:15] * nicetry checking it out
[11:34:18] <Z3R0> BlockUI Problem: I did a global block (shows a form)->with overlay clickable, then on submit (form).block() after ajax (form.unblock())) but now the main overlay is no longer clickable to close the global block.... if anyone has any suggestions
[11:40:32] <nicetry> Andrew_R: That worked perfectly!
[11:41:00] <nicetry> Thank you again for all your help - I have so much to learn in the world of js/jquery
[11:41:33] <Andrew_R> no problem, that was a fun one :)
[11:44:09] <nicetry> :)
[11:46:14] <Z3R0> Any BlockUI gurus out therE?
[11:47:29] <bsdbofh-> hmm, still trying to figure out.. $($(this).data('taskId')).remove();
[11:47:39] <bsdbofh-> this is a toughie
[11:47:44] <Z3R0> what's wrong with it ?
[11:48:02] <bsdbofh-> well, I've got the ID of a DIV stored in.. $(this).data('taskId')
[11:48:09] <bsdbofh-> and I want to remove that DIV from the page.
[11:48:13] <Z3R0> right data-taskID=X
[11:48:26] <Z3R0> you want to remove the div that corresponds to the taskID?
[11:48:29] <bsdbofh-> right
[11:48:37] <bsdbofh-> taskID is the ID of the DIV
[11:48:51] <Z3R0> full id?
[11:48:53] <bsdbofh-> yes
[11:48:54] <Z3R0> '#id'
[11:48:56] <Z3R0> or 'id'
[11:48:59] <bsdbofh-> oh.. hmm
[11:49:03] <bsdbofh-> just id
[11:49:06] <bsdbofh-> yeah, no #
[11:49:09] <Z3R0> '#'+$(this).data('taskID')
[11:49:16] <bsdbofh-> i'll bet that's it
[11:49:19] <Z3R0> ;)
[11:49:19] <bsdbofh-> trying now
[11:49:36] <bsdbofh-> so.. would I need to wrap that in $()?
[11:49:42] <Z3R0> of course
[11:49:45] <bsdbofh-> ok
[11:49:53] <bsdbofh-> $('#'+$(this).data('taskID')).remove();
[11:49:59] <Z3R0> $('#'+$(this).data('taskID')).remove();
[11:50:49] <nicetry> Andrew_R: one last thing, theres a default left-margin in bootstrap when multiple spans neighbors.  But in this case, when I change the span size, I want to zero out the margin.  I was thinking of appending .css('margin-left','0px');  to the change
[11:50:56] <bsdbofh-> damn, still no luck.
[11:50:57] <bsdbofh-> weird
[11:51:09] <nicetry> Andrew_R: The question is - how do I unest that margin-left, when I revert back?
[11:51:20] <Z3R0> reallyl ?
[11:51:34] <Z3R0> bsdbofh- do a console.log($(this).data('taskID'));
[11:51:40] <bsdbofh-> ok
[11:52:52] <nicetry> Andrew_R: scratch that - I got it.  -- .css('margin-left','');
[11:54:05] <bsdbofh-> hmmmm. it comes out as undefined. checking my code now.
[11:54:10] <Z3R0> yep ;)
[11:54:13] <Z3R0> thought that might be a problem
[11:54:26] <Z3R0> are you sure $(this) is referencing the clicked or toggled item
[11:54:48] <Z3R0> feel free to paste it with samples :0
[11:56:50] <TheSisb> do console.log( $(this) );
[11:57:58] <bsdbofh-> Z3R0, you can see where i'm trying this at line 75 of the javascript http://jsfiddle.net/PQUpB/8/
[11:58:14] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/jWB9P/ // working fiddle
[11:58:31] <bsdbofh-> it's functional on line 68
[11:58:40] <bsdbofh-> but, undefined on line 75
[11:59:18] <bsdbofh-> the data is set on line 14
[11:59:37] <Z3R0> erm TaskID isn't there...
[12:00:05] <Z3R0> why don't you just var it ?
[12:00:10] <Z3R0> beofre the ajax call ?
[12:00:13] <bsdbofh-> tasked isn't there?
[12:00:17] <bsdbofh-> errr taskid ?
[12:00:26] <Z3R0> ticketID = $(this).data('taskID');
[12:00:30] <Z3R0> ticket: ticketID,
[12:00:39] <Z3R0> $('#'+ticketID).remove();
[12:01:29] <Z3R0> <div id="reassign-form" title="Reassign to Team..."> // there's no taskID there
[12:01:31] <Z3R0> no data attribute
[12:01:44] <NoiseEee> .data does not add "data-" attributes.
[12:02:00] <NoiseEee> its for internal use/lookup.  if you want "data-" attributes, make 'em explicitly
[12:02:06] <Z3R0> yep
[12:02:09] <Z3R0> data is for reading not writing
[12:02:20] <Z3R0> can you attr() a data field ?
[12:02:29] <Z3R0> item.attr('data-id','value');
[12:02:36] <bsdbofh-> hmm
[12:03:01] <bsdbofh-> .data('taskId', options.$trigger.prop('id'))
[12:03:05] <bsdbofh-> is what I have on line 14
[12:03:13] <Z3R0> that shouldn't add it I dn't think
[12:03:17] <bsdbofh-> which, is setting .data(taskId)
[12:03:27] <Z3R0> yes it should...
[12:03:31] <Z3R0> http://api.jquery.com/data/#data1 //
[12:03:36] <Z3R0> says (key, value) will add
[12:04:05] <bsdbofh-> and then on line 68, I'm successfully reading that data value.
[12:04:23] <Z3R0> dummy
[12:04:32] <Z3R0> ticket: $(this).data('taskId'), // $('#'+$(this).data('taskID')).remove();
[12:04:37] <Z3R0> taskId != taskID
[12:04:47] <bsdbofh-> oh shit, are you serious?
[12:04:50] <bsdbofh-> ARGH
[12:05:02] <bsdbofh-> head + desk
[12:05:07] <Z3R0> roflcopter ;)
[12:05:09] <JFranks> Does accordian(); have some glitch where it adds a hidden/blank <a> or am I right in saying something wasn't implemented properly in the 'Learn More' accordian setup on http://www.smartimage.com/ ? ... if you look just after the H3 that holds that <a>, there's a second copy with a blank target? It's not in the page source so it looks like someone did some sloppy implementing of jQuery? If someone can confirm that's not a proper result from
[12:05:10] <JFranks> implementing the accordian I can let the dev know it's not just "me". ;)
[12:05:24] <bsdbofh-> you know.. if it isn't a quote somewhere, it's a wrong case character
[12:05:26] <bsdbofh-> hehe
[12:05:34] <Z3R0> or a semi-colon
[12:05:40] <bsdbofh-> yeah hah
[12:05:43] <Z3R0> I usually forgot )
[12:06:04] <jshultz> anyone familiar with jwplayer? On Android I'm going to be using webVTT files for captions and there's twelve languages available. Can I combine all twelve languages into one webVTT file that they can choose in android's player?
[12:06:18] <Z3R0> but I would say you might want to store that into a variable though
[12:06:25] <Z3R0> rather than retrieving the id over and over from the object
[12:06:40] <Z3R0> anything I do more than once, I store in a var lol
[12:07:04] <bsdbofh-> HAH! That worked.
[12:07:09] <bsdbofh-> Stupid D != d
[12:07:09] <bsdbofh-> hehehe
[12:07:11] <Z3R0> lol
[12:07:22] <Z3R0> ok so my problem! Anyone familiar with BlockUI ?
[12:07:40] <Z3R0> having a stupid problme, and I don't know how to solve...
[12:07:56] <bsdbofh-> Alas, I'm not. Or else I'd help :(
[12:08:02] <Z3R0> hehe
[12:08:03] <Z3R0> all good
[12:08:19] <bsdbofh-> but yes, someone who is help out Z3R0, he's got good eyes :D
[12:08:44] <Z3R0> lol
[12:08:56] <Z3R0> got lucky I guess, I didn't know jquery was case sensitive, was really just a guess
[12:16:54] <Z3R0> submitted problem to jquery forum as well

[12:19:51] <RedXIII> Is it nicer for the browser if I chain selector calls? For example the performance difference between $('.my_thing') vs $('#parent_div .my_thing')
[12:21:26] <Z3R0> I believe so
[12:21:32] <Z3R0> but I dunno honeslty
[12:21:46] <Z3R0> google?
[12:22:01] <RedXIII> Didn't find anything conclusive in my first searches.
[12:22:47] <initself> i want to emulate the clicking of this url upon changing a select box value: <td><a href="list_attempt/menu/?cust_num=[% cust_num %]&cont_num=[% cont_num %]&user_id=[% wb_count.wb %]" class="list_attempt">[% wb_count.wb %]</a></td>
[12:22:54] <Z3R0> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12290919/jquery-performance-multiple-selectors-vs-selector-with-context  ?
[12:23:08] <initself> it has a class of "list_attempt" which triggers a popup
[12:23:17] <initself> i want to trigger the same popup
[12:24:28] <Z3R0> looks like "#this .that" is faster than ".that" but not by much
[12:24:40] <initself> i see, i should put the url into my value
[12:28:26] <mllie> Hello
[12:28:33] <Z3R0> yo
[12:30:51] <mllie> What is a good plugin for validation? Is it possible to validate that one of a radiobutton-group should be selected as well?
[12:33:06] <jshultz> i want to provide a text field that users can fill out to send a tweet. I'm fine with using a plugin to do this. Does anyone have a suggestion?
[12:46:09] <initself> how can i pass a url into this popupWindow script?
[12:46:09] <initself> http://swip.codylindley.com/jquery.popupWindow.js
[12:47:21] <initself> jshultz: you want the thing that sends the tweet to live on the backend server
[12:47:46] <initself> jshultz: you can use ajax to communicate from your web page to the server so that the user doesn't have to refresh
[12:53:52] <BillCriswell> initself: You can do  { windowURL: 'http://www.google.com' } or it'll automatically use the href attribute.
[12:54:19] <initself> BillCriswell: that's what I've been doing with no luck
[12:54:28] <initself> seems like windowURL is always null
[12:54:29] <initself> settings.windowURL = this.href || settings.windowURL;
[12:54:54] <initself> settings.windowURL is set as null, and overridding it doesn't seem like something it wants to let me do
[12:55:02] <initself> does that make sense to you?
[12:55:20] <initself> BillCriswell: i feel like I must be missing something, or he really only intended it to be used with this.href
[12:56:41] <BillCriswell> initself: Switch this.href and settings.windowURL
[12:57:06] <BillCriswell> like so: settings.windowURL = settings.windowURL || this.href
[12:58:29] <BillCriswell> I wonder why he made that an option in the first place.
[12:58:54] <tw2113> .on() should be able to handle focus/blur pairings in 1 method call, right?
[12:59:32] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Yes... if I'm understanding right haha.
[12:59:53] <BillCriswell> .on('focus blur', function(){} or .on({focus: function(){}, blur: function(){});
[12:59:54] <tw2113> not sure i have my event right
[13:00:13] <tw2113> last one looks like what i need
[13:00:19] <tw2113> thanks bil
[13:00:21] <tw2113> BillCriswell,
[13:00:28] <initself> BillCriswell: i dont see how the switch fixes it
[13:00:36] <bil> you're welcome
[13:00:44] <initself> one thing you should know: i don't have a this.href
[13:01:22] <BillCriswell> initself: A browser may automatically put in a href attribute on <a> elements that are blank? I'm really not not sure.
[13:01:27] <mllie> What is a good plugin for validation? Is it possible to validate that one of a radiobutton-group should be selected as well?
[13:01:56] <initself> settings = $.extend({}, $.fn.popupWindow.defaultSettings, instanceSettings || {});
[13:02:03] <initself> would love to understand wtf that's doing
[13:02:11] <BillCriswell> initself: so this.href may always be truthy on a <a>.
[13:02:22] <initself> let me fiddle you
[13:02:43] <BillCriswell> That's just building a new object using the default settings and the settings you sent.
[13:02:50] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/HYWQ6/
[13:02:53] <initself> that's what I'm doing
[13:03:12] <initself> i dont see how settings ends up with my windowURL
[13:04:32] <BillCriswell> initself: I dunno.
[13:04:36] <initself> should i be able to go instanceSettings.windowURL and see my setting?
[13:04:57] <BillCriswell> initself: Yesh. Believe so.
[13:05:17] * initself tries.
[13:05:53] <BillCriswell> initself: Ah, typeof null returns object
[13:06:15] <BillCriswell> Oh wait.. nevermind.
[13:06:19] <BillCriswell> Yeah try what you were trying.
[13:06:25] <initself> so weird, it is printing the url just fine.
[13:07:27] <initself> console.log(settings.windowsURL); # undefined
[13:07:38] <BillCriswell> Try this.href
[13:07:41] <initself> console.log(instanceSettings.windowURL); # http://google.com
[13:08:01] <initself> here's extend: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[13:08:13] <initself> i'm pretty sure i don't have a this.href
[13:08:22] <initself> because i'm not actually clicking on a url
[13:08:32] <initself> i'm generating it from my select box
[13:08:47] <BillCriswell> yeah, but see what it says when you log it.
[13:09:24] <initself> undefined
[13:10:08] <initself> i think there's something going on with the change in my select box and actually clicking a value in the select box
[13:10:11] <initself> maybe
[13:16:33] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/HYWQ6/3/
[13:17:09] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/HYWQ6/5/
[13:17:16] <initself> that tells the story
[13:17:34] <initself> instanceSettings doesn't make it into the actual routine where .extend is being used
[13:17:42] <initself> (i wish i understood javascript)
[13:18:05] <bemap_> guys can anybody tell me what im doing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/eCZfJ/
[13:18:31] <abes> Question: can I reset the <input> value based on its name/id?
[13:19:22] <j_ayen_green> Why does this snipped not always work? Sometimes it works, but sometimes it is as if it is not beling clicked. http://pastebin.com/FK1NshQB
[13:20:09] <Smiggle> I used this for MP3 	$("#jquery_jplayer_1").jPlayer({ready: function (event) {$(this).jPlayer("setMedia", {mp3:"http://stream.mp3"}); WHAT DO I DO FOR .AAC ???
[13:20:57] <initself> bemap_: what am i doing wrong here is a terrible question
[13:21:12] <initself> abes: of course!
[13:21:19] <Z3R0> j_ayen_green: $('#personal-menu').css('display', $('#personal-menu').css('display')=='none' ? 'block': 'none'); there's no openening ( for the last )
[13:21:24] <Z3R0> nvm
[13:21:26] <Z3R0> missed it
[13:21:46] <Z3R0> is anything dynamically created?
[13:22:18] <abes> initself: yeah, nvm... i was referencing a wrong div... but now I have a different problem - setting the value to "" breaks my angular functionality, meaning the value is recognized not as empty but... wel... whatever "" means... and reset(); doesn't seem to restore it to its placeholder="" value...
[13:22:29] <bemap_> initself: ?
[13:22:50] <Smiggle> hi need help streaming raw .AAC not inside .M4A container
[13:23:03] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, I dropped a line when I pasted, but there's closure for every open. No syntax errors.
[13:23:05] <Smiggle> using jQuery
[13:23:39] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, Whe
[13:23:51] <Z3R0> yea, I noticed that
[13:24:12] <j_ayen_green> when I watch the value in firebug, 'none' on display stays that way while being clicked sometimes
[13:24:15] <initself> bemap_: why don't you try helping us see what you are trying to acheive?
[13:24:24] <initself> and where you are falling short?
[13:24:28] <Z3R0> can you fiddle it ?
[13:24:47] <bemap_> initself:  im trying to open a dialog when i click the user option
[13:25:20] <bemap_> initself:  failing in line 6, 7
[13:26:04] <initself> what is contextMenu() and where does it come from?
[13:26:20] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, don't think so. I guess the more general question is, should that work as a display toggle for a popup?
[13:26:34] <bemap_> its a plugin
[13:26:44] <j_ayen_green> Or is the timing of it depending on a setting of itself throwing it off
[13:27:03] <Z3R0> won't work for a toggle...
[13:27:09] <Z3R0> because you don't have anything if class == 'block'
[13:27:14] <Z3R0> er nvm
[13:27:17] <Z3R0> the if should switch it
[13:27:58] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, I have display = none? ? block : none
[13:28:17] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/qG7xW/ // fiddled
[13:28:19] <Z3R0> it works just fine
[13:28:40] <initself> bemap_: out of my league
[13:28:44] <initself> keep reading the plugin docs
[13:28:57] <Z3R0> but if #personal-menu doesn't exist at times, and it's loaded via ajax or something, you could have some problems....
[13:29:04] <Z3R0> unless you use the on()
[13:29:26] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, thanks!
[13:30:02] <Z3R0> anyone out there familiar with BlockUI ?
[13:30:09] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible for jquery to keep a dialog's div container in the current DOM position, rather than append it to the body? I need the modal to contain a form submit button for the larger form on the page, I just want to show a piece of the form in a modal. is this possible?
[13:30:27] <tomasm-> without moving the modal outside of the form tag
[13:30:37] <Smiggle> I used this for MP3 $("#jquery_jplayer_1").jPlayer({ready: function (event) {$(this).jPlayer("setMedia", {mp3:"http://stream.mp3"}); WHAT DO I DO FOR .AAC ???
[13:30:52] <Z3R0> convert to mp3 ? lol
[13:30:56] <Smiggle> ;p;
[13:30:59] <Smiggle> LMAO
[13:31:04] <Z3R0> hehe
[13:31:08] <Smiggle> ICECAST AAC
[13:32:52] <Smiggle> anybody? i am upgrading for SHOUTCAST to ICECAST for MANY reasons.... would like to use jQuery to stream the AAC
[13:33:04] <Smiggle> *from
[13:34:27] <Z3R0> http://www.jplayer.org/latest/demo-08/ // says it works for both ?
[13:35:19] <Smiggle> yes, if the feed is in m4a format (m4a is like a container for aac)
[13:35:24] <Smiggle> i am streaming raw AAC
[13:35:59] <Andrew_R> tomasm-: no I don't think so, maybe you could create hidden input fields to store what is entered in the modal?
[13:36:01] <Smiggle> if i setmedia as m4a and use raw AAC it doesnt wrk
[13:36:25] <Smiggle> if i setmedia as aac it doesnt work
[13:36:59] <tomasm-> Andrew_R, since it's just a visual review of the form, I will probably just have a button that triggers the form's submission on the main page
[13:37:40] <Andrew_R> tomasm-: that sounds like a good idea
[13:38:48] <Z3R0> any blockui gurus here?
[13:38:54] <Z3R0> odd Smiggle no idea then sorry man
[13:39:34] <NoiseEee> Smiggle: perhaps you should check with jplayer support.
[13:39:43] <Smiggle> will do!
[13:39:46] <Smiggle> no probs, thanks! back to the drawing board!!
[13:40:01] <Z3R0> yea I"m still awaiting a response...
[13:40:17] <Smiggle> still? for how long?
[13:43:02] <mllie> When I include jquery and an plugin I get from the plugin "jQuery is not defined". Why is that?
[13:44:02] <Smiggle> later!
[13:45:05] <initself> BillCriswell: the example in my fiddle works great, still missing what to do to run popupWindow without a class selector
[13:45:08] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/HYWQ6/13/
[13:45:45] <tomasm-> hi, how do I get a ui dialog to fit the screen and show scrollbars if it's too long/tall? autoResize: true and height: auto don't work
[13:46:01] <initself> ah, i need $(this)!
[13:46:52] <BillCriswell> initself: Only way I could think of is a hidden link that you'd trigger with $('.iTriggerAPopup').trigger('click')
[13:48:14] <initself> BillCriswell: the code in the fiddle is working: http://jsfiddle.net/HYWQ6/14/
[13:48:27] <initself> i can't get it to do anything on my server, however, which is bizarre
[13:49:05] <Z3R0> any blockui guys aorund?
[13:49:13] <BillCriswell> I thought you wanted to show the popup on change of the select.
[13:49:29] <jshultz> i want to provide a text field that users can fill out to send a tweet. I'm fine with using a plugin to do this. Does anyone have a suggestion?
[13:49:30] <initself> i do
[13:50:09] <initself> BillCriswell: before, I couldn't even get it to respond to any url i passed whatsoever
[13:56:21] <Z3R0> can jsfiddle not handle .submit() ?
[13:58:45] <Z3R0> nvm on that
[14:04:28] <BostonMA1776> Do I have to write my own algorithm if I want to calculate how many days are between two dates? This seems like something common I would expect an easier way. Does anyone know?
[14:04:39] <NoiseEee> BostonMA1776: check out moment.js
[14:04:59] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/6tH4E/ // if anyone has any ideas... blockUI demo (follow instructions to see error)
[14:05:12] <ilteris_> can someone tell me what's wrong with this syntax? console.log($('.researchrightcontent > div' + $(this)));
[14:05:22] <BostonMA1776> NoiseEee: I will check it out.
[14:05:35] <NoiseEee> ilteris_: you're trying to console.log two things?   use a comma instead of +
[14:06:16] <NoiseEee> otherwise, what the heck is that supposed to be doing?
[14:06:27] <ilteris_> NoiseEee: actually I was trying to get the selected element from the array I get back when I do this: console.log($('.researchrightcontent > div'));
[14:07:07] <zoned> $element.on("dragstart", function(event) { event.originalEvent.dataTransfer.setData("foo", "bar");      // false });     does anyone know why this doesn't work?
[14:07:36] <ilteris_> NoiseEee: Object[div.researchbox1, div.researchbox2, div.researchbox3, div.researchbox4]
[14:07:44] <initself> BillCriswell: i'm out of the woods, just wanted to let you know.  thanks for your help!
[14:07:55] <BillCriswell> initself: No problem!
[14:07:59] <NoiseEee> zoned: whats the console error?
[14:08:13] <zoned> NoiseEee: it's not an error, it just prints "false" when i try to do that
[14:08:27] <zoned> and getData("foo") returns an empty string
[14:08:47] <zoned> i've also tried setting "Text" and "text/plain" - same thing
[14:08:59] <NoiseEee> zoned: what library provides the 'setData' method?
[14:09:11] <zoned> supposed to be native drag and drop
[14:09:37] <zoned> i guess i could rewrite everything with jqueryui butâ€¦.
[14:09:45] <NoiseEee> zoned: try ##javascript
[14:10:02] <zoned> NoiseEee: well i am setting this on a jquery $el
[14:10:03] <codepython777> anyone here has used a file manager ?
[14:10:12] <zoned> because i made use of .on() instead of addEventListener
[14:10:30] <zoned> perhaps jquery event doesn't support dataTransfer?
[14:11:27] <ilteris_> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/bWbpS/2/ all I am tryign to do is make the left selected link have hover color, that's all.

[14:15:26] <ilteris_> NoiseEee:!!!! you are a genius! thanks man
[14:17:22] <ilteris_> NoiseEee: should I assign the first link an initial selected class? so it comes blue?
[14:18:43] <NoiseEee> up to you
[14:21:48] <Z3R0> grrrrr....
[14:25:25] <jshultz> has anyone had any experience with using a jquery plugin or something to send contents of a textbox as a tweet?
[14:25:38] <jshultz> i'm just looking for something pretty easy I can drop in to a page and be done with it. no sense reinventing the wheel.
[14:26:56] <Assimilater> Hey all, I'm trying to mimic how this http://jsfiddle.net/MHLjy/28/ pans the map to the circle on http://dottest.aquaveo.com/index.php?q=sMap.php (allow geolocation and wait for it to show your location and accuracy circle) but circle.getBounds is producing a type error and I'm not sure why. Looking at the console both circles (though derrived differently) seem to produce the same output, both objects have getBounds in the function listings. Any ideas?
[14:27:21] <mattp__> $.when(promises).then(function() {  _.each(promises, function(p) { console.log(p.state()) });  }); // this is firing immediately, and outputting [pending, pending] in the console.log. what??

[14:31:35] <Andrew_R> jshultz: is this what you are looking for? https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button
[14:32:56] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. I'm looking for suggestions on either a tutorial or a jquery plugin that does the "parallax" effect for a slider (that is responsive)
[14:33:02] <LindsayMac> (or can be made responsive at least)
[14:33:22] <JFranks> K... I've got a site where the user base is primarily noobs seeking info.. On one hand we want to keep the site looking nice, because nobody trusts an ugly site.. On the other hand if the search box isn't some offset color with a crazy looking search button hanging off it, noobs complain they can't find info on the site.. So I was thinking of something with jQuery animations  where the search box gets a slick looking 'shimmer' effect that won't
[14:33:22] <JFranks> drive everyone else nuts?
[14:33:46] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  sounds more like you need to hire a UI designer
[14:33:52] <LindsayMac> a solid UI should do the tric
[14:33:54] <LindsayMac> trick*
[14:34:03] <anew> are you guys combining all ur jq plugins into one file ?
[14:34:19] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/6tH4E/ // if anyone has any ideas... blockUI demo (follow instructions to see error) // if anyone has any thoughts
[14:34:20] <eddiemonge> JFranks: link?
[14:34:21] <Andrew_R> JFranks: can you give the URL?
[14:34:38] <eddiemonge> anew: well im not linking to a billion files
[14:34:46] <anew> eddiemonge how many plugins ?
[14:34:49] <Andrew_R> anew: using ASP.NET MVC4's bundling feature, yes
[14:35:20] <JFranks> LindsayMac: Yeah, I wish! Sadly I'm just going "leave it plain" because anything I do with jQuery is going to probably get annoying as you're reading stuff.. (I'd link the site but it's not public accessible).. I might be able to make a fiddle?
[14:35:25] <anew> asp.net... can i use that if i'm programming in php ?
[14:35:47] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  a screenshot could work.. just to see what you are dealing with
[14:35:50] <eddiemonge> anew: more than one
[14:36:01] <anew> obv lol
[14:36:05] <anew> like 10 or more?
[14:36:08] <anew> or is that to many
[14:36:23] <eddiemonge> anew: look at http://h5bp.com
[14:36:44] <Andrew_R> haha no, ASP.NET is Microsoft's web platform, C#, .NET, etc
[14:36:56] <eddiemonge> specifically https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.1.0/doc/js.md
[14:37:15] <LindsayMac> anew:  that question doesnt make much sense.
[14:37:21] <anew> what question
[14:38:30] <LindsayMac> "asp.net... can i use that if i'm programming in php ?"
[14:38:36] <Andrew_R> anew: the browser will only open 6 concurrent connections at a time, and that includes the page itself, all css files, all js files, all images, etc
[14:38:51] <anew> forget that question, just looking for an answer to my original
[14:39:00] <Andrew_R> so you decide if you should bundle them or not...
[14:39:16] <Z3R0> O.o really Andrew_R I actually never knew that...
[14:39:26] <anew> what... u cant load script tags amd...
[14:39:38] <Z3R0> so basically either they load in queue to the others 6 at a time, or you combine?
[14:39:59] <bemap_> Guys is it valid to do this.. $('.context-menu-one').on('click', function(e){         var loc = new Object;         loc.href = 'controllers/addusersController.php';         loadUsersAdd(loc); })
[14:40:00] <Andrew_R> Z3R0: yep, 6 http connections is the default, any more will queue
[14:40:00] <anew> dont listen to him, they wont load asynchonusly
[14:40:12] <JFranks> Oooh actually.. This might be the sort of nice subtle effect I need.. but I'm thinking I'd want a mouse tracking function that has a minimum delay before it re-triggers.. and does not trigger when someone is just idle/reading.. http://jsfiddle.net/P2eHE/
[14:40:28] <Andrew_R> now, your css and js files are probably pretty small, so they load fast and it doesn't make a whole lot of difference
[14:40:34] <Z3R0> right
[14:40:41] <Andrew_R> plus, once you have it once, it should be in the cache and it wont download it again
[14:40:42] <anew> no this is bad information
[14:40:49] <anew> dont listen to him
[14:40:51] <Z3R0> I mean, I know I have a page that is a sample admin panel template... that loads like 50 plugins
[14:41:04] <anew> 1) script tags do not load asynchronously and 2) you are opening multiple http connections to load each js file
[14:41:14] <LindsayMac> JFranks: you dont need jquery to do that .. You can just do a nice CSS hover effect
[14:41:24] <Z3R0> anew who said anything about script tags?
[14:41:32] <JFranks> Last time I tried doing time in JS it broke all over the place with NaN errors in everything except Opera and Chrome.. So I'd love to find an example/lib/something far more skilled than me. ;)
[14:41:32] <Z3R0> and 2 he stated only 6 https connections at once...
[14:41:51] <Z3R0> meaning if the there are 6 big files and 2 smallers ones after, the 2 small ones won't start until one or two of hte bigger ones finish first
[14:41:59] <Andrew_R> Z3R0: if you use firebug, look at the Net tab when you load the page (clear cache first) and you'll probably see the queuing happen
[14:42:08] <Z3R0> yea I use chrome's debugger
[14:42:17] <JFranks> LindsayMac: But I wouldn't want it to trigger a lot, just like say 1.5 seconds after the mouse is moved, IF the effect hasn't been triggered in the last 30 secs?
[14:42:20] <anew> this is like internet 1995... imo that is bad advice
[14:42:35] <Z3R0> aren't you the one that posed the question in the first place?
[14:42:37] <anew> to just say 'put all ur js files at the top because more connections will open to load them'
[14:42:41] <Z3R0> why bitch about the answer if you already know it ?
[14:42:57] <LindsayMac> derp
[14:43:04] <anew> who the hell is bitching!
[14:43:09] <anew> i use require.js
[14:43:19] <anew> to async load in dev and then roll it up for production
[14:43:27] <anew> that takes care of my framework and code
[14:43:35] <Z3R0> want a cookie ?
[14:43:39] <anew> ur a fkn moron
[14:43:41] <JFranks> What?! No.. You use PHP to auto-minify and merge the JS functions the page is calling dynamically as a named package so the browsers can still cache it.
[14:43:43] <anew> u asked a quesiton
[14:43:46] <Foxhoundz> anew: what if the user disables javascript
[14:44:00] <Z3R0> and I'm not arguing answers that come from it...
[14:44:00] <anew> i write webapps, if u have javascript disabled u cant use it
[14:44:05] <anew> it's 2013...
[14:44:14] <Andrew_R> then put up a big image on the page " NO JAVASCRIPT = NOT WELCOME "
[14:44:15] <Andrew_R> lol
[14:44:15] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  oh sorry.. I misunderstood
[14:44:24] <Foxhoundz> anew: so much for graceful degredation
[14:44:31] <Foxhoundz> degradation*
[14:44:35] <JFranks> LindsayMac: It's cool, I have that effect on humans. ;)
[14:44:39] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  actually http://podsframework.org does something like that with the little green arrow on the top right
[14:44:40] <anew> u really write single page webapps for users that dont have js?
[14:44:42] <anew> that is idiotic
[14:44:50] <anew> you  might as well not even write a webapp
[14:44:54] <anew> just write it server side
[14:45:03] <Foxhoundz> anew: and it's not a web app. It's a website.
[14:45:09] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  to be honest, when i first noticed it i didnt really NOTICE it. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me
[14:45:13] <Foxhoundz> Let's not sugar coat what hypertext means
[14:45:13] <LindsayMac> for like.. days
[14:45:14] <anew> no... it's a WEBAPP
[14:45:20] <anew> site is content heavy
[14:45:27] <Foxhoundz> DOM manipulations and ajax doesn't mean it's a web app
[14:45:31] <eddiemonge> lets all be nice now ....
[14:45:34] <Z3R0> might as well use angular ;)
[14:45:34] <anew> what the hell are you even talking about
[14:45:43] <boygrmn88> http://amateurgirlfuckedhard.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-best-amateur-and-pornstar-collection.html
[14:45:44] <Foxhoundz> anew: I should ask you the same thing
[14:46:00] <Z3R0> lol porn spammer lol...
[14:46:04] <anew> ever hear of backbone, if ur writing a single page webapp with templating
[14:46:06] <Z3R0> great timing
[14:46:07] <anew> it's a webapp
[14:46:09] <anew> not a website
[14:46:13] <Foxhoundz> Sure.
[14:46:36] <eddiemonge> Z3R0: whats wrong with angular?
[14:46:44] <JFranks> Hypertext: Text that drinks too many double gulps from 711?
[14:46:48] <Z3R0> nothing, I was just saying if he was making a webapp, than he should use angular ;)
[14:46:51] <Z3R0> I love it
[14:47:23] <JFranks> OOOh I wonder what's at that URL??
[14:47:25] <Foxhoundz> I just believe the term 'webapp' is yet another marketing buzzword for startups, akin to 'web 3.0', and 'providing solution'
[14:47:49] <Foxhoundz> solutions*
[14:47:54] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  did you see the little "jitter" effect on that site?
[14:47:54] <Z3R0> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application
[14:47:56] <anew> not really it's specifically for somethingthat is clientside heavy
[14:48:02] <anew> i.e. i have zero php in my webapp
[14:48:05] <anew> just the REST server
[14:48:11] <JFranks> LindsayMac: Your monitor must be better than mine.. i do NOT see anything shcging.. It's like one of those .gifs with a single layer?! ;)
[14:48:13] <anew> and db queries
[14:48:13] <Z3R0> as it should be ;) anew
[14:48:16] <anew> there's a difference
[14:48:39] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  you have to wait a little while. it does it subtly
[14:48:54] <JFranks> LindsayMac: You do know it's the 4th right?
[14:49:08] <LindsayMac> wait? where am i? is this Disney world?
[14:49:21] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  seriously though.. Just look at it for a few minutes.. no hovering on mouse over or anything
[14:49:54] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  it is not a gif. its a little js that animates it slightly to call attention to it
[14:52:07] <Z3R0> oooo
[14:52:17] <Z3R0> LindsayMac JFranks I saw it ;)
[14:52:17] <JFranks> I'll try reloading it in FireFox, might be this beta of Chrome I'm using (Blink).. Do you need to click the banner at all?
[14:52:18] <Z3R0> it shook :)
[14:52:27] <Z3R0> JFranks make sure hte arrow is in the down position
[14:52:33] <Z3R0> and wait about 5-10 seconds
[14:53:12] <LindsayMac> Z3R0: kinda cool right
[14:54:22] <Andrew_R> LindsayMac: it's the kind of thing that wow's clients
[14:54:40] <Z3R0> yea pretty neat actually
[14:54:41] <JFranks> I think my problem is ADD.. I apparently can't stare at something for 15 seconds.. ? :)
[14:54:54] <LindsayMac> Andrew_R: yea.. i wouldn't go THAT far.. but it was what JFranks was kinda looking for. Something to subtly draw attention to
[14:54:57] <Z3R0> I think first load open the arrow
[14:55:00] <Z3R0> if you close the arrow box
[14:55:03] <Z3R0> and then refresh
[14:55:07] <JFranks> AH
[14:55:09] <Z3R0> you should see it happen pretty soon
[14:55:16] <JFranks> Now I see.. damn that's subtle
[14:55:30] <Z3R0> but it's enought o draw your eye
[14:55:39] <Andrew_R> it's the kind of thing to wow noob users?
[14:55:47] <JFranks> If you're a normal human apparently.. ;)
[14:55:49] <Z3R0> mmmhmmm ;)
[14:55:54] <Z3R0> lol JFranks
[14:55:56] <Andrew_R> someone's gotta be wowed by this, I just know it lol
[14:55:59] <LindsayMac> Andrew_R:  thats not what he was trying to do
[14:56:12] <LindsayMac> he didnt want to WOW users.. he wanted to draw attention to a specific area just enough so that they notice it is there
[14:56:21] <Z3R0> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Shake // just do something like this lol
[14:56:27] <JFranks> Just trying to cut down on the # of "couldn't find the search box" complaints.. ;)
[14:56:27] <Andrew_R> yes, I understand
[14:56:33] <anew> anyone know how to speed up domcontentloaded time
[14:56:40] <Z3R0> don't make one ?
[14:56:45] <JFranks> Without generating "I hate the search box" complaints.. ;)
[14:56:48] <Z3R0> Ha! 0 millisecond loading time :0
[14:56:57] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  good design..
[14:56:58] <LindsayMac> seriously
[14:57:49] <JFranks> Oh yeah, this isn't much of a design problem, it's top right, says 'search' in the placeholder text, and has a 'search' button beside it.. ;)
[14:58:00] <JFranks> All the complaints are from inexperienced users. ;)
[14:58:19] <LindsayMac> its a design problem
[14:58:33] <LindsayMac> if a user (no matter their comfort with your site) can not find something, its a UI problem
[14:58:46] <LindsayMac> and inexperienced with what.. your site or the interwebs?
[14:59:13] <Andrew_R> JFranks: post us up a screenshot :)
[14:59:21] <JFranks> Actually it is a bit of a design problem.. the menus are too static.. so when someone adds a new document the search is the only way to find it.. ;)
[14:59:37] <JFranks> So noobs surf the menus, and then say "couldn't find it"..
[14:59:52] <LindsayMac> JFranks:  its a design problem. Trust me.
[14:59:56] <LindsayMac> post a screenshot
[15:00:15] <JFranks> It's just an intraweb document site that a local nerd slapped up so these guys wouldn't pay for hsarepoint.. ;)
[15:00:29] <LindsayMac> so its a HUGE design problem
[15:00:34] <LindsayMac> meaning there probably isn't any
[15:00:40] <Andrew_R> haha :)
[15:00:49] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/7z32r/ // let's shake it ;)
[15:02:46] <bet0x> Hello all, i got an issue, wich is weird to me, when i load an editor (one like CKEditor for an textarea an keyup event doesn't run, i do this: $("#bodycontent").cleditor({height:300}); and next to that i have $('#bodycontent').keyup(function(){ sendValueKeywords($(this).val()); });
[15:03:04] <Andrew_R> Z3R0: it's really fun to try to enter input on that Search field
[15:03:04] <bet0x> but for some reason if i remove the $("#bodycontent").cleditor({height:300}); my keyup even works.
[15:03:42] <Z3R0> lol Andrew_R
[15:04:02] <Z3R0> http://jqueryui.com/effect/#default // question all those effects are "OUT" effects, can they work inversely for bringing something IN?
[15:04:08] <JFranks> Z3R0: LoL.. I'm tempted to have some fun with that.. "$('body').mousemove(function(event) {$('#searchbox').css('left', mouseloc.x, 'right' mouseloc.y);});"
[15:04:11] <Andrew_R> bet0x: I think that ckeditor is probably capturing and stopping propagation on the keyup event
[15:04:16] <Z3R0> rofl JFranks
[15:04:18] <Z3R0> there ya go
[15:04:26] <Z3R0> the never ending chase
[15:04:35] <JFranks> YOU WILL FIND THE SEARCH BOX
[15:04:46] <Z3R0> but never be able to click it ?
[15:04:50] <bet0x> Andrew_R there is a way to prevent that kind of issue?
[15:04:53] <JFranks> >:)
[15:05:08] <bet0x> coz i got the same issue with ALL editos, like tiny_mce and CKEditor too
[15:05:19] <Andrew_R> <input type="text" name="search" style="height: 100px; width: 800px; background: red; color:white"/>
[15:05:23] <Andrew_R> problem solved?
[15:06:25] <Andrew_R> bet0x: I haven't used those in quite a long time. Check the documentation to see if there are any events it triggers that you could bind to.
[15:07:00] <bet0x> all editors has the same issue
[15:07:15] <bet0x> can i change the keyup to something wich won't stop it?
[15:07:21] <bet0x> or won't fix it?
[15:07:58] <Andrew_R> why do you need to capture keyup? maybe you can go at it from the other direction.
[15:09:09] <Andrew_R> bet0x: looks like there is a change event http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.ui.dialog.uiElement-event-change
[15:09:27] <bet0x> Andrew_R i use CL no CK.
[15:10:01] <bet0x> Andrew_R CK is messed and big, i wanted it simple so i use this one: https://github.com/cleditor/cleditor
[15:10:24] <Andrew_R> oh sorry, let me look at that one
[15:10:28] <JFranks> You know why Google chose 'blink' for the new replacement to WebKit in Chrome? .. Cause even a Japanese person saying it would convey "soon"
[15:11:13] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/6tH4E/ // if anyone has any ideas... blockUI demo (follow instructions to see error) // if anyone has any thoughts
[15:11:53] <Andrew_R> cleditor also has a change event, which is fired from keyup and mouseup events
[15:11:58] <Andrew_R> http://premiumsoftware.net/cleditor/docs/GettingStarted.html
[15:12:09] <LindsayMac> So anyone have a decent plugin or tutorial that can show me how to make an animated / layered/ parallax effect slider?
[15:12:27] <Z3R0> wtf is a parallax effect
[15:12:37] <Andrew_R> bet0x:  so I think you can use $('#bodycontent').on('change', function(){ sendValueKeywords($(this).val()); });
[15:12:56] <gnarf> LindsayMac: check out scrollorama or superscrollorama
[15:13:02] <gnarf> best libs ive seen for those effects
[15:13:23] <LindsayMac> I've used both before.. I think they're a little more than I will need for this
[15:13:24] <gnarf> `g jquery superscrollorama
[15:13:25] <b-ot> gnarf: SUPERSCROLLORAMA â†’ http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/
[15:13:47] <gnarf> well the code in them might be useful too ;)
[15:14:01] <bet0x> Andrew_R that messed up the editor! :P
[15:14:13] <bet0x> maybe because i use jquery 1.6.1 ?
[15:14:35] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  would it be worth using even if i have no need to bind to the scroll action/ window position
[15:14:44] <Andrew_R> yep, .on is 1.7+
[15:14:53] <Andrew_R> $('#bodycontent').bind('change', function(){ sendValueKeywords($(this).val()); });
[15:15:07] <gnarf> LindsayMac: prolly not, you could prolly do the same with css3 animations on elements
[15:15:11] <Z3R0> don't really like the whole .on() but I get the idea behind it
[15:15:17] <gnarf> do some fancy transform/translates
[15:15:23] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/6tH4E/ // if anyone has any ideas... blockUI demo (follow instructions to see error) // if anyone has any thoughts - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/blockui-global-block-then-element-block-no-overlay-click
[15:15:42] <gnarf> LindsayMac: but the code for moving stuff around/defining keframes could still be usable
[15:16:05] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  yea.. I kind of wanted to use a combination of both... and keyframes definitely could be useful, but its really pretty new to the animation aspect of jquery
[15:16:20] <LindsayMac> So kinda just looking for a good tutorial to follow
[15:16:27] <LindsayMac> that may also result in what I want in the end :)
[15:17:22] <bet0x> Andrew_R both examples doesn't work!
[15:17:34] <rebel_yell_> quick question ; if i am in the root page and want to be redirect to a different page wahts the code for that
[15:17:55] <Andrew_R> bet0x: ok sorry man, it was kind of a stretch, I've never used cleditor before.
[15:18:46] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell_: location.href="path/to/file.html";
[15:19:14] <bet0x> Andrew_R don't worry
[15:19:20] <bet0x> Andrew_R i will see how to fix this
[15:26:49] <LindsayMac> I think i'm gonna take a look at the source here and see if I can get it to work for what I need it to do http://tympanus.net/Development/ParallaxContentSlider/
[15:38:52] <freannrak> i'm trying to replace the contents of the div with the original one when reset button is clicked. Everything works fine on the first click, but 2nd click deletes the whole div. http://dpaste.de/krNSE/
[15:53:46] <lolhii> How do I select a class in prototype js?
[15:53:52] <lolhii> $('.classname') doesnt work :l
[15:53:54] <lolhii> says null
[15:54:53] <lolhii> select by id works
[15:54:57] <lolhii> $('id')
[15:56:08] <TheSisb> in prototype js?
[15:57:25] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/6tH4E/ // if anyone has any ideas... blockUI demo (follow instructions to see error) // if anyone has any thoughts - http://forum.jquery.com/topic/blockui-global-block-then-element-block-no-overlay-click
[16:34:28] <eddiemonge> lolhii: wrong chat
[16:39:44] <ariefbayu> hi guys, I'm having this weird bug on iOS platform. Specifically, on 3GS. I'm not sure what keyword should I google. Do you guys happened to have the same problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15781518/jquery-mobile-automatically-reloaded-and-disabling-javascript-on-ios-5/15808067?noredirect=1#15808067
[16:58:05] <jtal> is there any problem ajax from /some/place to /another/place ?
[16:58:08] <jtal> doesnt seem like there should be
[17:00:40] <jtal> I get an error with nothing in the arguments to error
[17:01:11] <Z3R0> got codE?
[17:02:14] <jtal> http://pastie.org/7321574
[17:02:45] <jtal> if I change type to html and point it to an html file in the same directory, its ok; if I switch to json and point to /something/else , it goes into error callback, no error message though
[17:02:51] <jtal> and I tried vising the url as is
[17:02:53] <jtal> good json
[17:05:50] <jtal> textStatus says "error"
[17:07:08] <JFranks> Hmmm on a site using JS/jQuery for navigation, wget skips all the JS links, so if there's no <a href=""> in the source files then the pages never get copied.. Must be a way to tackle this without manually using a browser?
[17:08:24] <Z3R0> what? JFranks?
[17:09:41] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[17:14:27] <Z3R0> does ajax default to 'GET' ?
[17:17:01] <shoky> ?ajax
[17:17:02] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:18:04] <Z3R0> ok they are... so that's ok
[17:18:36] <Z3R0> jtal is the url you display the same one you go to ?
[17:20:00] <jtal> yes
[17:20:13] <Z3R0> any errors in console? or the network tab ?
[17:20:15] <jtal> they are two different apps in tomcat, but on the same host/port
[17:20:17] <jtal> no errors
[17:20:25] <Z3R0> what about network ?
[17:20:28] <jtal> the textStatus says "error" and the error var says nothing
[17:20:32] <jtal> oh lemme see
[17:21:30] <jtal> it says cancel for that one
[17:21:33] <jtal> hrm
[17:22:11] <jtal> ooooh, I think it might be cross domain problem
[17:22:17] <Z3R0> could be a problem :)
[17:22:19] <jtal> http/https
[17:22:20] <Z3R0> jsonp ?
[17:22:37] <jtal> I havent used that yet bt I was just trying to figure it out
[17:23:03] <jtal> do I just specify the whole url then change type to jsonp?
[17:23:15] <jtal> or is there more
[17:23:22] <Z3R0> I have no idea honestly, never used it ;)
[17:27:49] <yaboo> is there a jquery mobile channel?
[17:28:05] <Z3R0> there's one user in #jquery-mobile
[17:28:09] <coldhead>  i think this is it bro
[17:28:25] <gf3> bruh
[17:35:26] <initself> what determines precidence in CSS?
[17:35:31] <initself> why does one class overwrite another?
[17:35:44] <Z3R0> usually it's order
[17:35:59] <Z3R0> but also specificity I think... and then !important
[17:36:20] <initself> i've got the one before the other now, but no change
[17:36:24] <eddiemonge> initself: top to bottom. cascading style sheets
[17:36:29] <initself> the color of one always overwrites the other
[17:36:46] <Z3R0> 1st -> make the color this, 2nd file -> no make the color this
[17:36:50] <eddiemonge> and specificity
[17:37:03] <eddiemonge> inspect it to see which styles are being applied
[17:37:10] <Z3R0> 1st -> make the color this !important -> 2nd file-> no make it this (denied!)
[17:37:29] <initself> cool guys, thanks
[17:37:31] <initself> eddiemonge++
[17:37:35] <initself> Z3R0++
[17:45:28] <jtal> oh I see- with jsonp the server is returning a js function thats just returning an obj that would have been the same as if you were doing json
[17:51:10] <relipse> how do i check if the current element is a text (can do .select() on it) ?
[17:52:04] <tw2113> a text?
[17:53:21] <danheberden> gonna guess .is('input') or .is(':input') ?
[17:53:54] <danheberden> oh nevermind, the good ol' ask in #jquery and ##javascript trick
[17:54:07] <tw2113> #jQuery is on the downslide! we have people here guessing, instead of educationally guessing
[17:54:44] <relipse> ?
[17:54:50] <relipse> what was that for?
[17:54:53] <poacheR> Greetinks and salutations :)
[17:55:15] <relipse> danheberden
[17:55:20] <poacheR> I'm trying to change the default background-color for the twitter widget
[17:55:33] <danheberden> relipse: expressing my sadness
[17:55:41] <poacheR> unfortunately the widget doesn't provide that ability itself (it only provides the choice between light and dark themes)
[17:55:42] <tw2113> isn't there a twitter widget setting for that poacheR
[17:55:47] <tw2113> ah
[17:55:50] <tw2113> css then
[17:55:59] <tw2113> and gratuitous use of !important
[17:56:02] <poacheR> if after the page has loaded, I go into the inspector and do document.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').contentDocument.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').style.backgroundColor="#002147";   this works
[17:56:26] <poacheR> however, if I just insert this in the page it doesn't; presumably because it tries to access this style before the widget has actually loaded
[17:56:27] <danheberden> tw2113: or use css specificity?
[17:56:42] <tw2113> probably need that too danheberden
[17:56:50] <poacheR> so I thought of using jquery to wait until the widget has loaded before attempting to change the css style of that element
[17:56:57] <poacheR> but I'm not sure how to do that
[17:57:02] <tw2113> ?css
[17:57:02] <b-ot> tw2113: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[17:57:03] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[17:57:20] <poacheR> I tried: $('#twitter-widget-0').ready( function() {document.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').contentDocument.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').style.backgroundColor="#002147"; });
[17:57:21] <tw2113> whoever added that gif to the bot output deserves good karma and a beer
[17:57:26] <poacheR> (as well as .load)
[17:57:59] <poacheR> any ideas how I could ensure the iframe has finished loading before I can apply my style change?
[17:58:08] <tw2113> poacheR, link?
[17:58:33] <eddiemonge> poacheR: for iframe use .load
[17:58:38] <poacheR> (link?)
[17:58:52] <eddiemonge> poacheR: but a better approach would be to see if the widget has a ready callback event
[17:58:53] <tw2113> you have a link we could see?
[17:58:58] <poacheR> I tried .load ... but it still doesn't change the style
[17:59:00] <relipse> I have a weird question, i have a foreign phone number that is 3 input boxes, how can i mkae it so if you CTRL-V or right click--> paste in the first one it automatically fills the 2nd one as well?
[17:59:03] <poacheR> you mean like a testcase?
[17:59:14] <poacheR> oh sory
[17:59:16] <tw2113> i mean a url that has your twitter widget embedded
[17:59:19] <poacheR> yes, here is what I'm working on: http://www.kelloggmcr.com/main/?
[18:00:00] <poacheR> you can spot the jquery attempt at the very end of the source
[18:00:03] <eddiemonge> relipse: dont limit the input on the first one. check for paste mouse up or keyup and then change the value and add the values to the other boxes
[18:00:38] <eddiemonge> poacheR: you should put js at the bottom and cdn load jquery
[18:00:40] <poacheR> I repeat, that command works if done through the console
[18:00:58] <poacheR> (why? the page loads faster or sth?)
[18:01:02] <tw2113> try this poacheR
[18:01:16] <Z3R0> page loads before it starts hitting all the included js files
[18:01:27] <tw2113> #twitter-widget-0.thm-dark { background-color: #002147 !important; }
[18:01:28] <Z3R0> this way even if there is an error, the page loads
[18:01:31] <lolhii> Why doesn't this insert? I'm using prototype js http://jsfiddle.net/DC5Z7/7/
[18:01:33] <tw2113> and change the hex to whatever
[18:01:37] <relipse> eddiemonge: ok the tricky part is i have like a mask plugin that automatically corrects the input removing non-digits
[18:01:40] <poacheR> ( eddiemonge: as in at the bottom but still within the body, right?)
[18:01:42] <tw2113> add that line to your css somewhere
[18:02:21] <tw2113> danheberden, http://amyvernon.tumblr.com/post/47149606165/gpoy
[18:02:23] <poacheR> what does !important do? Does it stop it from being overridden later?
[18:02:36] <Z3R0> yep
[18:02:36] <tw2113> it adds to its specificity
[18:02:39] <Z3R0> it's important
[18:02:44] <tw2113> so that it is the style that gets used
[18:02:59] <tw2113> ?mdn important css

[18:03:07] <tw2113> close enough
[18:03:19] <poacheR> nope, didn't work :(
[18:03:30] <poacheR> having said that
[18:03:56] <poacheR> the iframe has #twitter-widget-0 as an id ... but then the document it contains also has a div with that id ... and it's that div that uses this style
[18:03:57] <tw2113> trying to find it with firebug
[18:04:01] <poacheR> (not the iframe)
[18:04:19] <tw2113> there it is
[18:04:20] <poacheR> I'm assuming #twitter-widget-0.thm-dark { background-color: #002147 !important; }   might be going for the iframe instead?   (which wouldn't make sense, but there you go)
[18:04:37] <eddiemonge> poacheR: you cant change it in the widget config?
[18:04:55] <tw2113> #twitter-widget-0 #twitter-widget-0.thm-dark
[18:04:56] <poacheR> eddiemonge: no, it's not one of the configuration options.
[18:04:58] <tw2113> try that :D
[18:05:04] <poacheR> :D
[18:05:06] <poacheR> thanks, let me try
[18:05:31] <eddiemonge> you are trying to change the background of an element in an iframe that has a different domain as the source. might not be possible
[18:06:05] <poacheR> nope :|
[18:06:13] <poacheR> tw2113: ^
[18:06:18] <tw2113> i saw
[18:06:25] <tw2113> and it's for shit like this that i hate iframes
[18:06:29] <poacheR> eddiemonge: if I run the command from the console it works
[18:06:36] <poacheR> but not if I just include it in the source
[18:06:41] <poacheR> which is why I'm assuming it's a timing thing
[18:06:59] <tw2113> timing wouldn't come into play with css
[18:07:03] <poacheR> is there a way to check if the iframe has finished all its stuff first?
[18:07:10] <eddiemonge> poacheR: try putting your .load inside of a doc ready block
[18:07:20] <tw2113> eddiemonge, i'm trying just css at the moment
[18:07:24] <tw2113> nothing with jquery
[18:07:31] <eddiemonge> you might have to do a setTimeout to check to see if the element exists
[18:07:38] <eddiemonge> or maybe delegate load
[18:08:13] <eddiemonge> tw2113: did i give you advice right now?
[18:08:19] <tw2113> nope
[18:08:24] <tw2113> you were talking to poacheR
[18:08:29] <tw2113> who i'm trying to help too
[18:08:48] <eddiemonge> oh i was confused
[18:08:49] <poacheR> like this?   $(document).ready( function() { $('#twitter-widget-0').load( function() { document.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').contentDocument.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').style.backgroundColor="#002147"; }); });
[18:09:14] <poacheR> heheh
[18:10:31] <codepython777> anyone has a file manager widget in jquery they have used?
[18:10:47] * tw2113 bitchslaps iframes
[18:10:59] <tw2113> twitter is getting anal about this type of stuff too
[18:11:18] <coldhead> i've managed jquery files in windows explorer, is that close enough?
[18:13:08] <tw2113> just in australia
[18:13:12] <tw2113> coldy
[18:13:56] <coldhead> i have managed my android file system from my web browser using AirDroid
[18:14:00] <coldhead> that's pretty close too
[18:14:09] <coldhead> i am basically an expert on jquery + file management
[18:14:09] <Z3R0> well I managed to fix my crappy blockUI problem
[18:14:16] <Z3R0> but it involved a bunch of shit I didn't wanna do
[18:14:43] <coldhead> you sound like my wife
[18:14:51] <coldhead> on the subject of getting pregnant
[18:14:55] <Z3R0> lol
[18:15:01] <danheberden> i was about to say the same thing
[18:15:04] <danheberden> ... about coldhead's wife
[18:15:14] <Z3R0> I said it because of coldhead's wife...
[18:15:22] <danheberden> whoa
[18:15:23] <snkcld> i recently saw a jquery menu on hacker news,  but i can't find it… it actually popped out and in from the sides… does anyone know what it was called? and if not, can anyone recommend a good plugin to use for menus?
[18:15:40] <acidjazz> snkcld: it was hacked
[18:15:43] <poacheR> I'm assuming that the $(document).ready() thing doesn't necessarily check if the iframes have finished loading ... right?
[18:15:55] <acidjazz> poacheR: negatory thats outside of the dom
[18:15:57] <Z3R0> I liked dcmegamenu's lol
[18:15:59] <snkcld> acidjazz, it was…. hacked…? what are you talking about
[18:16:04] <Z3R0> but it depends on what you are looking for
[18:16:05] <poacheR> :(
[18:16:11] <acidjazz> snkcld: it was hacked and hte hacker ran off w/ it.. it was a news article on their site
[18:16:23] <poacheR> so is there no way to check if the iframe has loaded? :(
[18:16:33] <acidjazz> poacheR: have hte iframe report to the parent
[18:16:33] <danheberden> poacheR: you can use the load event
[18:16:42] <Z3R0> http://www.berriart.com/sidr/#usage // this one ?
[18:16:53] <snkcld> acidjazz, that doesn't make any sense. anyway, can anyone else recommend a good j query menu plugin?
[18:16:55] <Z3R0> ^ snkcld
[18:17:01] <poacheR> acidjazz: I'm not the one creating the iframe; it's created by the twitter widget
[18:17:16] <poacheR> I'm trying to change the background color of the twitter widget
[18:17:18] <snkcld> Z3R0, PERFECT. thank you
[18:17:33] <poacheR> conceptually, I'm trying to do this: document.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').contentDocument.getElementById('twitter-widget-0').style.backgroundColor="#002147";
[18:17:42] <Z3R0> and so you know how I found it...
[18:17:42] <Z3R0> http://bit.ly/XUciuN
[18:17:51] <poacheR> but it fails, presumably because not everything has loaded by the time it tries to access it
[18:18:35] <snkcld> Z3R0, lol. yea, i tried googling it but i guess i must have missed it
[18:18:47] <Z3R0> lol hehe ;)
[18:18:52] <poacheR> btw, yes, the iframe is created dynamically from the twitter script ...
[18:19:05] <tw2113> making iframes even more isolated and evil
[18:19:18] <poacheR> lol ... I won't disagree with you there :p
[18:19:59] <poacheR> I suppose I can put a ridiculous timeout to check if it really is a timing issue ...
[18:21:08] <tw2113> maybe twitter will bend over a smidge and let users choose the background colors
[18:21:15] <tw2113> i'm doubtful as of the past year, but you never know
[18:22:05] <poacheR> yup ... the timeout makes it work :S
[18:22:24] <tw2113> hey, you have a solution
[18:22:32] <tw2113> now i can go home in peace
[18:22:35] <tw2113> and tranquility
[18:22:35] <poacheR> :p
[18:22:54] <danheberden> when in doubt, setTimeout
[18:23:01] <poacheR> I guess I'll just write a shitty function that polls until the element exists, then changes the shitty colour and goes to bed :p
[18:23:08] <poacheR> heheh
[18:23:43] <danheberden> because $(iframe).on('load', function(){ /* change colour */ }) is too messy?
[18:24:17] <poacheR> I tried    $(iframe).load(function() { /* change colour */})   but that doesn't work
[18:24:26] <poacheR> I'll try your syntax too, maybe that'll work :)
[18:24:59] <danheberden> .load() is the old syntax
[18:25:09] <danheberden> but should do the same thing
[18:25:24] <danheberden> it could be that after the iframe is loaded, twitter then adds the elements
[18:25:28] <danheberden> that you're after
[18:25:45] <danheberden> which if so, bummer and you'll have to poll the iframe
[18:25:53] <poacheR> yeah, no, doesn't work danheberden  :(
[18:26:04] <poacheR> I think that's the case, yes
[18:26:19] <poacheR> which is why I was wondering if there's a way to check when the 'contents' have loaded, not just the iframe
[18:26:37] <danheberden> poacheR: that's what load is
[18:26:44] <poacheR> maybe something to do with   contentDocument ?
[18:26:46] <danheberden> but, like, if there is more work after the initial one
[18:26:53] <danheberden> you'd have to do a domcontentloaded event
[18:26:56] <danheberden> but that isn't x-browser
[18:27:01] <poacheR> ok
[18:27:02] <danheberden> not contentloaded, sry
[18:27:08] <danheberden> whatever the nodeadded or domchanged event is
[18:27:09] <danheberden> i forget
[18:27:12] <danheberden> it's on MDN
[18:27:12] <poacheR> maybe I can check if it 'changes' ?
[18:27:44] <poacheR> meh, screw it ... I'll poll it :(
[18:27:49] <danheberden> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Mozilla_event_reference
[18:27:54] <poacheR> anyway, thanks for the insights guys :)
[18:28:26] <danheberden> DOMNodeInserted
[18:28:38] <danheberden> oh all deprecated
[18:28:41] <danheberden> well nevermind
[18:31:32] <poacheR> mutation observers
[18:31:52] <poacheR> to be honest ... it doesn't sound that much more sophisticated than the polling business :p
[18:31:54] <poacheR> might as well
[18:32:10] <poacheR> it's not like I'll be polling more than a couple of milliseconds anyway
[18:32:17] <poacheR> anyway. thanks again :)
[18:35:18] <relipse> is there a way to remove the maxlength attribute ONLY while pasting and then add it back?
[18:35:45] <gp> How can I enhance a snippet manually loaded with ajax using jquery mobile?
[18:37:43] <danheberden> relipse: you could check key events vs change vs content
[18:37:51] <danheberden> to see if more than one letter was added in bulk
[18:37:59] <danheberden> which would indicate a paste
[18:45:10] <gp> $.mobile.activePage.trigger('create'); appears to be working... but I feel like can't be the correct way since I am not actually creating a new page
[18:50:09] <eddiemonge> relipse: you could do an artificial max length with js and backend code
[18:54:47] <Gmac_> whats the point of jquery mobile?
[18:54:51] <Gmac_> i just use media queires
[18:54:54] <Gmac_> ?
[18:55:00] <Gmac_> and regular jquery
[18:55:27] <relipse> how do i var_dump in javascript?
[18:55:32] <Z3R0> console.log()
[18:55:37] <relipse> k
[18:57:01] <poacheR> for completion, could someone confirm for me that this is working on their side too? :)   http://www.kelloggmcr.com/main/?
[18:57:12] <poacheR> (the twitter widget should turn blue, instead of the default grey-black)
[18:58:06] <eddiemonge> Gmac_: to provide an optimized mobile experience complete with ajax style page loads and custom widgets
[18:58:42] <Gmac_> I've never used itâ€¦ is it like a framework
[18:59:26] <relipse> is there a reason why my .on('paste' is not getting called???
[18:59:47] <eddiemonge> Gmac_: read about it jquerymobile.com
[18:59:56] <eddiemonge> relipse: because paste isnt an event?
[19:00:11] <relipse> its not??
[19:00:13] <relipse> yes it is
[19:01:03] <relipse> why isn't onpaste or onpaste2 showing up in console: http://jsfiddle.net/D7jVR/106/
[19:05:39] <Z3R0> can't console on fiddle
[19:07:01] <relipse> yes you can
[19:07:08] <relipse> you have to change to the results frame
[19:07:36] <Z3R0> ah neato ;)
[19:09:11] <relipse> why isn't onpaste or onpaste2 showing up in console: http://jsfiddle.net/D7jVR/106/
[19:12:24] <shoky> relipse: opts.inputs[0] != this   is wrong
[19:12:31] <shoky> this is a jquery object
[19:13:04] <shoky> and this is even wrong-er: $(opts.inputs).prepend($(this)[0]);
[19:13:43] <shoky> you're prepending the first input to the each of the inputs
[19:13:50] <shoky> to each*
[19:16:53] <shoky> relipse: and then you're doing $(this).on('paste')   where 'this' is $('#fst')
[19:17:16] <shoky> er well maybe that last part is intentional, nevermind
[19:17:34] <relipse> oh shoky thanks for your input
[19:17:40] <relipse> this is my 2nd jquery plugin
[19:18:02] <relipse> how do i prepend to the array then?
[19:18:18] <relipse> and why is opts.inputs[0] != this wrong?
[19:18:30] <shoky> opts.inputs[0] is a DOM element
[19:18:35] <shoky> 'this' is a jquery object
[19:18:41] <relipse> no its not?
[19:18:45] <shoky> yes it is
[19:18:53] <relipse> this refers to the first element in the $('#fst') array
[19:18:56] <relipse> right?
[19:18:58] <shoky> no
[19:19:03] <shoky> this refers to $('#fst')
[19:19:08] <relipse> so i need $(this)[0] ?
[19:19:11] <shoky> no
[19:19:14] <relipse> why not?
[19:19:26] <shoky> just add [0]
[19:19:31] <shoky> don't wrap a jquery object inside a jquery object
[19:19:39] <shoky> this[0]
[19:19:39] <relipse> i'm so confused
[19:19:45] <shoky> if you want the first element in that jqeury object
[19:20:00] <relipse> yes i need to check if it is already prepended
[19:20:10] <shoky> you dont prepend stuff to a collection of element
[19:20:12] <shoky> elements
[19:20:16] <shoky> you prepend a child to a parent
[19:20:44] <eddiemonge> what is fromPaste?
[19:20:52] <relipse> look it up
[19:21:00] <relipse> it works thats all i know
[19:21:03] <shoky> a custom event namespace
[19:21:16] <shoky> meaningless in this fiddle
[19:21:27] <relipse> how do i insert an element to the front of that array then?
[19:21:51] <shoky> do you want to manipulate an array
[19:21:53] <shoky> or the DOM>?
[19:22:08] <shoky> opts.inputs is a jquery object
[19:22:11] <shoky> not an array
[19:23:00] <shoky> to manipulate an array you can use .push() and .unshift() for examples
[19:23:18] <shoky> but that won't touch the DOM
[19:24:45] <shoky> relipse: you should really read this thorougly http://docs.jquery.com/Plugin
[19:25:44] <shoky> (and whether you've seen it before or not is totally irrelevant)
[19:26:21] <shoky> relipse: remember, you're not doing a .each() where it loops through the elements in a jquery object
[19:26:37] <shoky> you're writing a jquery method. it's totally different
[19:27:06] <shoky> inside you can do an .each() ,that's very common
[19:27:15] <shoky> this.each(..), that is
[19:28:33] * tw2113 says something so shoky isn't alone
[19:28:43] <relipse> i got it almost working
[19:28:50] <relipse> i commented out that code you said was bad
[19:28:54] <relipse> actually someone else did and showed me
[19:29:04] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/D7jVR/108/
[19:32:10] <eddiemonge> there is a lot going on that i feel can be simplified but i dont know all the reqs for this
[19:32:24] <codepython777> anyone ever coded a file manager in jquery/js?
[19:33:25] <eddiemonge> relipse: whats the point of the max-lengths?
[19:34:45] <eddiemonge> relipse: what is it you are trying to do again?
[19:35:47] <relipse> YES YES YES
[19:35:50] <relipse> CHECK THIS OUT EVERYONE
[19:35:51] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/D7jVR/109/
[19:35:57] <relipse> i got this sucker
[19:36:01] <relipse> paste into first text box
[19:36:10] <relipse> like a number or something
[19:36:18] <relipse> 18340
[19:36:24] <relipse> and watch it roar!
[19:36:37] <eddiemonge> relipse: i pasted text and got undefined
[19:36:44] <relipse> browser?
[19:36:52] <relipse> paste a long number
[19:36:57] <relipse> 53084532809580
[19:37:19] <relipse> better yet, try pasting "53-882-9999"
[19:37:31] <tw2113> 867-5309
[19:37:52] <relipse> can you guys help me make the code better before I submit it as a plugin?
[19:38:07] <eddiemonge> again, whats it supposed to do?
[19:38:17] <relipse> are you serious you dont know
[19:38:24] <tw2113> my guess: paste across multiple inputs
[19:38:26] <relipse> it lets you paste into multiple boxes
[19:38:31] <relipse> exactly tw2113
[19:38:32] <tw2113> why...i dunno
[19:38:39] <relipse> for foreign phone numbers
[19:38:45] <relipse> make it easy for user
[19:38:52] <tw2113> o.O
[19:39:46] <tw2113> my mind is hoping this is a very simplified setup
[19:39:57] <tw2113> because i'm not sure how good usability will be if this is it
[19:40:18] <relipse> dude its absolutley chill
[19:40:20] <eddiemonge> so given a set of text like input boxes, if text is pasted into a box, break it up based on some arbitrary value like max-length or a delimiter, and move the remaining text into the remaining boxes?
[19:40:26] <relipse> exactly!
[19:40:34] <relipse> maxlength it is dependent on
[19:40:59] <tw2113> my websites in 1998 were pretty chill too...
[19:41:21] <relipse> so anything wrong with the codE?
[19:41:23] <relipse> how can I make it better
[19:41:27] <relipse> i'm going to put it on github
[19:42:04] <eddiemonge> what is the regex remove for?
[19:42:16] <tw2113> remove the console.log lines first
[19:42:16] <relipse> remove all NON digits
[19:42:22] <relipse> of course tw :)
[19:42:38] <relipse> for example paste 5 5 5 55 5
[19:42:40] <tw2113> still trying to figure out how this would help anyone
[19:42:42] <relipse> it will only pastae 55555
[19:42:52] <relipse> why?
[19:43:02] <relipse> ssn #s
[19:43:03] <relipse> phone #s
[19:43:03] <tw2113> because it makes zero sense to me?
[19:43:07] <relipse> anything with multiple text boxes
[19:43:09] <tw2113> why not ONE input for them
[19:43:10] <relipse> product keys
[19:43:21] <relipse> i dunno
[19:43:27] <tw2113> instead of 1 character across X amount of inputs
[19:43:28] <relipse> it goes together with my hopinput plugin
[19:43:37] <tw2113> tab key
[19:43:40] <tw2113> tab index
[19:43:40] <relipse> its not only 1 character
[19:43:53] <relipse> i'll havae to try longer maxlengths
[19:44:16] <eddiemonge> yeah, why not have it in one input box?
[19:44:32] <relipse> dunno
[19:45:36] <eddiemonge> i kind of hate it when sites break things up into separate boxes like for a phone number
[19:45:49] <eddiemonge> just get a better regex validator instead of having multiple boxes
[19:46:59] <relipse> the last site i did had multiple boxes for foreigh phone numbers
[19:47:05] <relipse> so i figured i'd help em out
[19:47:24] <eddiemonge> doesnt mean its the right solution if thats what they did. perhaps you should help them by converting to one box?
[19:47:30] <tw2113> give it ice cream, ice cream makes everything better
[19:48:25] <nitrix> Meow.
[19:48:28] <nitrix> I agree.
[19:48:56] <nitrix> Ice cream even makes eating ice cream better!
[19:49:19] <relipse> ok since my code is without flaw i will submit it to github
[19:49:22] <tw2113> that it does
[19:49:32] <tw2113> ice cream makes even bacon edible
[19:49:41] <nitrix> relipse: no guts, no glory.
[19:50:01] <nitrix> tw2113: icecream makes you edible.
[19:50:07] <nitrix> tw2113: oh wait.
[19:50:10] <eddiemonge> relipse: there are lots of flaws
[19:50:36] <yogurt_truck> relipse: your entire plugin is a flaw
[19:50:43] <shoky> relipse: you don't really have an understanding in how jquery plugins work.. why submit it?
[19:51:07] <tw2113> he has a springboard to improve on then
[19:51:11] <tw2113> you all started somewhere
[19:51:29] <shoky> of course
[19:51:32] <relipse> thats right bam!
[19:51:35] <relipse> tw to back me up
[19:51:45] <yogurt_truck> btw ice cream is incredibly overrated
[19:51:47] <tw2113> and you have a lot to improve on
[19:51:49] <tw2113> *runs*
[19:52:05] <tw2113> lemme guess yogurt_truck... frozen yogurt > ice cream?
[19:52:17] <yogurt_truck> ofc
[19:52:29] * tw2113 adds to ignore
[19:53:04] <yogurt_truck> :>
[19:53:22] * tw2113 would agree with yogurt_truck but then we'd both be wrong.
[19:54:56] <SocialEvil> hi guys :) i am looking for a siiimple jquery plugin that will allow me if i have 2 buttons like - home | contact us, to slide the main div on my page with the appropriate content. all i can find in google are some complicated plugins that i cant understand :) any ideas?
[19:57:27] <shoky> SocialEvil: that's much too general. you don't need a plugin to .. slide stuff. or have buttons
[19:57:35] <defaulto|away> hey folks, my friends and I are planning to do some sharing and learning things we know over the internet. We are all from different states. What free tool would be nice to use to share our screen?
[19:57:52] <tw2113> google hangout defaulto|away
[20:09:13] <defaulto|away> thanks tw2113

[20:22:08] <tw2113> you forgot a version number
[20:22:11] <tw2113> very amateur
[20:22:14] <tw2113> also a license
[20:22:18] <tw2113> i suggest wtfpl
[20:22:30] <phizes> wtfpl?
[20:22:36] <tw2113> ?g wtfpl
[20:22:37] <b-ot> tw2113: wtfpl â†’ http://www.wtfpl.net/
[20:22:37] <eddiemonge> and a minified version
[20:22:39] <bot-t> tw2113, wtfpl - http://www.wtfpl.net/
[20:22:40] <eddiemonge> and unit tests
[20:23:04] <tw2113> yeah! i'd have to make my own minified version??
[20:24:04] <relipse> i dont want to propogate the fword or i would
[20:24:13] <relipse> mirc should have spellcheck
[20:24:32] <phizes> relipse: it's for a good cause
[20:26:03] <relipse> WEPL
[20:26:06] <relipse> whatever pl
[20:26:08] <relipse> lol
[20:26:13] <relipse> thats the Jesus <3 version
[20:26:41] <tw2113> Jesus: YOLT
[20:26:48] <phizes> otherwise bsd or mit or gpl if you like people that eat stuff off of their feet
[20:27:54] <relipse> tw2113: what is yolt?
[20:28:25] <tw2113> you only live twice
[20:28:26] <phizes> you only live twice?
[20:28:34] <phizes> ergh, beaten to it
[20:28:35] <relipse> lol nice
[20:28:39] <tw2113> jesus is always showing everyone else up
[20:28:46] <relipse> what you mean?
[20:28:47] <tw2113> "hahaha, i can come back from the ded, suckers!"
[20:28:49] <relipse> hes the Son of God
[20:29:08] <relipse> "death could not keep its grasp on Him"
[20:29:14] <relipse> the bible says
[20:29:20] <tw2113> it says a lot of things
[20:29:26] <relipse> so do you?
[20:29:40] <tw2113> that's true, calling me a bible?
[20:29:50] <relipse> one thing that makes one more valid is the authority one has
[20:30:02] <tw2113> given by man himself is all
[20:30:09] <relipse> billions of people write a book, great, God writes a book, whoah
[20:30:17] <tw2113> assuming you believe
[20:30:22] <tw2113> i want to see the original draft personally
[20:30:23] <relipse> whether or not you believe
[20:30:28] <phizes> God didn't write the bible anyhoo
[20:30:32] <relipse> there are multiple copies
[20:30:36] <relipse> phizes: says who?
[20:30:44] <tw2113> i want to see the one before humans got their editing hands on it
[20:30:47] <relipse> look at the jews, they use half the book
[20:30:47] <coldhead> whatever you believe, the king james translation of the bible is one of the best works in the english language
[20:30:52] <coldhead> AND I THINK THERE ENDETH THE MATTER
[20:31:04] <coldhead> NO MORE GOD BOTHERING, IT JUST UPSETS PEOPLE
[20:31:05] <phizes> relipse: Are they not attributed to the writings of peter etc?
[20:31:16] <relipse> tw2113: most arent bad, the bad versions say that homosexuality is ok, etc
[20:31:25] <relipse> phizes: yes but God gave the words for him to write
[20:31:45] <relipse> ok boys, take it to #jesus where we won't get banned
[20:31:47] <relipse> lol
[20:31:50] <tw2113> which is why i want to see the original draft provided by god himself, before some homo hating person snuck those lines in
[20:32:03] <tw2113> to see if it was there already or not
[20:32:04] <relipse> maybe God intended a man to be with a woman?
[20:32:15] <tw2113> maybe he didn't and someone else did
[20:32:25] <relipse> yeah thats where the penis and vagina come from
[20:32:31] <relipse> its not rocket science
[20:32:39] <tw2113> penis and asshole works just as well
[20:32:47] <relipse> not if you dont want poo all over it
[20:32:57] <tw2113> that's why he invented water
[20:32:58] <relipse> and i'm hoping you havent tried
[20:33:09] <tw2113> i just have no problem with those who have
[20:33:27] <relipse> man not meant for man :(
[20:33:40] <tw2113> assumes people
[20:34:02] <tw2113> and people have to believe to give any authority to this book
[20:34:10] <relipse> no they dont :)
[20:34:14] <tw2113> yes, they do
[20:34:17] <relipse> you can not believe obama is president but he still is
[20:49:22] <eddiemonge> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/D7jVR/113/
[20:51:16] <eddiemonge> relipse: sorry this is better. http://jsfiddle.net/D7jVR/114/  also allows you to paste after entering some data
[20:52:17] <eddiemonge> still lots of edge cases though
[20:52:35] <eddiemonge> and still not the best UI solution but if you want to go down this path ...
[21:00:47] <voidpirate> ay!
[21:02:19] <relipse> test
[21:04:18] <relipse> eddiemonge: oh yeah i was actually hoping someone would do that
[21:04:31] <relipse> eddiemonge: can you fork my repo and edit it and do a pull request
[21:04:41] <eddiemonge> nope
[21:04:48] <relipse> k
[21:05:59] <relipse> eddiemonge: that code is completely rewritten
[21:06:01] <coldhead> larls
[21:06:03] <relipse> good job
[21:06:45] <coldhead> let's all take a break guys
[21:10:26] <czpython> so I find myself in a predicament
[21:11:40] <czpython> how can I create a div, an image outside said div and an a tag that wraps both ?
[21:13:37] <coldhead> $('<div class="wrapper"><div class="inner"></div><img src="#"></div>')
[21:20:55] <Fuzai> http://dev.neurobots.net/beta_console/ <--- how would I get the tab content to scale to 100% or even 90% of the space available correctly?  right now it works sorta well until i get over 1600 pixels wide or under 1000 pixels wide
[21:21:11] <Fuzai> i'm using width 80% and it works for most of it
[21:21:19] <Fuzai> but i'm sure there is a better way
[21:23:47] <voidpirate> why not use 100%?
[21:24:04] <Fuzai> because it gets caught up in the tabs on the left
[21:24:34] <voidpirate> you want the content to be scaled width=100%?
[21:24:42] <voidpirate> why not move the tabs to the top?
[21:24:48] <Fuzai> yes but account for the tabs on the left too
[21:25:01] <Fuzai> because i think it looks tacky and i'm gonna end up with about 20 tabs
[21:25:06] <Fuzai> this is just the mockup for now
[21:25:11] <Fuzai> there will be alot more tabs
[21:25:15] <voidpirate> hmm
[21:25:26] <voidpirate> not that far of a jQuery wizard yet ;)
[21:25:31] <Fuzai> same here
[21:25:38] <Fuzai> i'm just starting to finally get the hang of whats going on
[21:25:41] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:25:48] <Fuzai> do you know about try.jquery.com ?
[21:25:49] <voidpirate> brilliant
[21:25:56] <voidpirate> yes
[21:27:16] <voidpirate> I always work with tabs on the top
[21:27:32] <voidpirate> which gives me the ability to scale the content accordingly
[21:33:20] <SCIF> http://jsfiddle.net/Cdsx4/ How i can duplicate div.test into div.controls ?
[21:33:33] <SCIF> s/div.controls/div.control/
[21:33:45] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Cdsx4/1/
[21:34:48] <Fuzai> just the html or the css as well?
[21:34:53] <SCIF> Cork: You made my day. Awesome! Thanks
[21:37:39] <voidpirate> Fuzai: what?
[21:37:51] <Fuzai> voidpirate: ignore me
[21:37:57] <voidpirate> ok
[21:45:27] <voidpirate> try.jquery.com is too easy, I would recommend reading a book
[21:45:39] <voidpirate> it is super basic level knowledge
[21:46:02] <voidpirate> which teaches you the syntax greatly, but for a novice I would read a book
[21:47:55] <Odigem> Hi

[21:58:59] <Cork> Odigem: why do you need a client?
[21:59:19] <Cork> Odigem: writing it natively isn't exactly hard
[21:59:32] <Odigem> its dnt work
[21:59:50] <Cork> are you sure the server supports the protocol the browser uses?
[22:00:42] <Cork> loads of server only support the insecure stone age 75 protocol
[22:01:43] <Odigem> Cork: >>> ws = create_connection("ws://localhost:5000
[22:01:43] <Odigem> >>> ws.send('sssssssssssssss11111111111111')
[22:01:56] <Odigem> where fucking message on my page?
[22:02:14] <Cork> uh
[22:02:27] <Cork> the server needs to handle ws
[22:02:40] <Cork> and it needs to have an interface to grab the message
[22:02:56] <Odigem> http://dpaste.com/1047635/
[22:03:03] <Odigem> i run fk server
[22:03:12] <Odigem> it receive messages
[22:03:34] <Cork> ok?
[22:03:52] <Cork> is the question how you listen for messages from the server?
[22:03:59] <Odigem> lol
[22:04:04] <Cork> or what
[22:04:09] <Odigem> i can receive messages only in python
[22:04:26] <Odigem> i  want receive on page
[22:04:28] <Odigem> with ajax
[22:04:45] <Odigem> but i can send message from page
[22:05:46] <Cork> var ws = new Websocket('ws://localhost:5000'); ws.onmessage = function(data) { console.log(data); };
[22:06:07] <Cork> opps sorry
[22:06:18] <Cork> WebSocket not Websocket
[22:06:54] <Cork> Odigem: but like i said, the server needs to support the modern protocol
[22:07:05] <Cork> if if only support the old protocol specs, you can't use it
[22:07:17] <Odigem> Cork: WHAT?
[22:07:24] <Cork> preferably it should support the hibi-13 prodocol
[22:07:25] <Odigem> fk js
[22:07:38] <Cork> as thats the first protocol support in ie
[22:07:48] <Cork> hibi-10 works in most browsers
[22:07:57] <Cork> anything older then that is useless
[22:08:22] <Cork> (mostly only works in python, perl and other concept scripts)
[22:09:08] <Cork> Odigem: the older specs are insecure
[22:09:15] <Cork> and thats why few browsers support it
[22:09:41] <Fuzai> http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#vertical <-- i noticed that  just the name and not the whole tab is clickable, is there any way to make the whole tab clickable?
[22:09:48] <Cork> firefox and opera even pushed emergency releases to block them back in the days
[22:10:41] <Odigem> Cork:  http://dpaste.com/1047638/
[22:10:49] <Odigem> why this dnt receive messages?
[22:11:22] <Cork> Fuzai: ui-tabs a { width: 100%; }
[22:11:32] <Cork> sigh
[22:11:33] <Fuzai> ty :)
[22:11:41] <Cork> Odigem: what protocol does the server support?
[22:11:51] <Cork> i think i've asked this like 4 times now...
[22:12:49] <Odigem> Cork:  RFC 6455. ?
[22:13:02] <Cork> and you have verified this?
[22:13:11] <Odigem> what?
[22:13:40] <Cork> and you have verified that it actually uses that version?
[22:14:14] <Odigem> Cork: man i dnt understand u
[22:14:19] <Odigem> i use this
[22:14:22] <eddiemonge> Fuzai: you will have to play with the css to make the anchor fill the whole li. or take off width: 12em from the ul
[22:14:25] <Odigem> https://ws4py.readthedocs.org/en/latest/sources/servertutorial/#wsgiref
[22:14:47] <Fuzai> ty :)
[22:15:19] <Fuzai> i set the width to 10em and it seemed to do the trick
[22:15:58] <Cork> ok, that looks like it actually follows the spec
[22:16:16] <Odigem> Cork: u can give me one worked client?
[22:16:22] <Cork> Odigem: try adding ws.onerror = function() {}
[22:16:39] <Cork> Odigem: most of the problem is getting the server to work
[22:16:52] <Cork> Odigem: what i gave you IS a working client
[22:17:42] <Cork> its almost a copy of what i use my self (on several sites actually)
[22:18:25] <Cork> the only thing i didn't add there was the onclose and onerror handlers
[22:18:36] <Cork> and those are to handle when the connection is lost
[22:18:43] <Cork> (for automatic reconnection)
[22:23:47] <SocialEvil> guys i am a real newbie and i wrote kinda redundant script for fadingin/out a content depending on which button a user clicks.. http://pastebin.ca/2350065 here it is.. and because my buttons are "home / contact us" is there a way to change the url like domain.com/aboutus.html (and when a person copy/paste and open in browser, he would see the aboutus page) ?? because both divs i hide and show
[22:23:47] <SocialEvil> are on index.html page
[22:25:46] <Tekra> Anyone recommend a simple, free (MIT/BSD/similar) javascript loader for jquery and addons?
[22:27:01] <vick08> Hi. Does anybody know if there is a way to make jQuery Mobiel accordion display horizontally instead of vertically? ALternatively, is there a similar widget I am missing? I just need a tabview-like behavior.
[22:37:54] <anirvana> hello
[22:38:37] <anirvana> How can I override the default event that causes tooltip to show in jqueiry ui tooltip? the default event happen to be mouseover.
[22:40:26] <Odigem> why i receive my message??
[22:40:36] <Odigem> >>> ws.send("sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss")
[22:40:42] <Odigem> Incoming message: sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
[22:40:52] <eddiemonge> SocialEvil: window.history
[22:40:54] <Odigem> its must go to client
[22:42:44] <Odigem> Can "Upgrade" only to "WebSocket".
[22:42:47] <Odigem> what is?
[22:46:23] <SocialEvil> eddiemonge thanks
[23:01:05] <miCSu> just realized that .next() and .prev() methods with selector still check just on previous/next sibling
[23:01:37] <miCSu> what'd be the best way to find next sibling matching to selector?
[23:01:54] <miCSu> should I just go with loop
[23:03:03] <miCSu> wow, there's also nextAll
[23:15:36] <SocialEvil> eddiemonge i managed to make when a person clicks on the buttons home | about us, to get the url to change, but is there a way to make it so, that if a person copy/paste the address ,depending if it ends on home.html or aboutus.html not to give me 404, but to show the appropriate content from index.html ?
[23:16:24] <eddiemonge> you need your back-end code to do that
[23:16:31] <anli> If I have an onclick handler, I can use var link = $(e).which; to get the tag which initiated a click, right?
[23:16:59] <SocialEvil> eddiemonge care to explain a bit more ? cause i have no idea what that means
[23:18:26] <eddiemonge> SocialEvil: do you know what back end/front end means when it comes to coding?
[23:18:43] <eddiemonge> anli: no. use this or $(this)
[23:18:48] <anli> Got window
[23:19:00] <eddiemonge> anli: e is the event if you pass it in to the event handler
[23:19:08] <eddiemonge> anli: code?
[23:19:09] <anli> Its not an event handler added by jquery
[23:19:24] <eddiemonge> anli: im confused then
[23:19:47] <anli> Its not that confusing, onclick="return foo()"
[23:19:57] <anli> oops
[23:20:00] <Cork> anli: e isn't added by jquery
[23:20:04] <anli> I actually use onclick="return foo(event)"
[23:20:14] <Cork> its the event object browsers give to events
[23:20:23] <SocialEvil> eddiemonge now that you mention it.. not sure.. the code that.. does stuff with the collected information ?
[23:20:28] <anli> Then I try to use $(e).which
[23:20:30] <Cork> and there is no reason to wrap it in jquery call
[23:20:36] <eddiemonge> anli: why are you using onclick?
[23:20:47] <anli> I like that
[23:20:53] <Cork> O_o
[23:21:04] <anli> O_o is the least convincing argument
[23:21:08] <Cork> anli: you know that even attributes break event listeners right?
[23:21:10] <relipse> how can i find checkboxes with a name that ends with foobar?
[23:21:15] <anli> Cork: no?
[23:21:16] <anli> How
[23:21:18] <eddiemonge> SocialEvil: if you dont have a backend like php or ruby then you might just want to do something like index.html#home
[23:21:44] <Cork> anli: event attributes is from old dom1 specs, and doesn't partitsipate in the event loop
[23:21:45] <SocialEvil> i see thanks
[23:21:54] <relipse> $('input[name$="foobar"]') <-- ends with foobar?
[23:21:55] <eddiemonge> relipse: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[23:21:58] <Cork> anli: so you can't control it or anything like all
[23:22:04] <anli> I dont want to control it
[23:22:11] <relipse> beat you to it eddiemonge
[23:22:12] <relipse> :)
[23:22:14] <anli> Control should only be used when needed
[23:22:15] <Cork> *like that at all
[23:22:35] <eddiemonge> anli: why would you want to put an event listener inline?
[23:22:36] <anli> As anything else
[23:22:36] <Cork> uh
[23:22:46] <Cork> eddiemonge: its not an event listener
[23:22:56] <anli> I like to do it, there is no magic in how many event handlers I have doing that
[23:23:04] <anli> There are no loose ends
[23:23:26] <anli> I am not in for discussing this actually
[23:23:30] <anli> Have no time
[23:23:31] <anli> :)
[23:23:33] <eddiemonge> except for the highly coupled code. where are you defining the functions?
[23:23:35] <Cork> and there is no way to write scripts obstructively through it
[23:23:43] <anli> You have asked me before, I bet you will ask me later on
[23:24:04] <Cork> eddiemonge: there is only one way, globally
[23:24:19] <Cork> you don't have scopes in you do it like that
[23:24:30] <anli> eddiemonge: In a js file, if they are not few
[23:24:39] <anli> Then it is nicer to have them in the script tag
[23:24:49] <Cork> anli: but the answer is; e is an object, not an element. so don't wrap it in jquery
[23:24:53] <anli> To lower distances beteen definition and usage
[23:24:57] <Cork> ...
[23:25:07] <anli> Thanks a lot for actually answering
[23:25:10] <anli> :)
[23:25:19] <anli> But what does .which belong to then?
[23:25:20] <Cork> anli: i've already said it twice
[23:25:27] <Cork> but you apparently missed it
[23:25:32] <eddiemonge> anli: to lower distances between definition and usage is the exact reason to use external event handlers
[23:25:35] <Cork> the event object
[23:25:44] <Cork> ya
[23:25:48] <anli> Sorry, there is a lot of discussion about I prefer or not in here, I missed your first attempt, Cork
[23:26:04] <anli> But .which is added by jquery, right
[23:26:09] <Cork> no
[23:26:11] <anli> oh
[23:26:36] <Cork> anli: you REALLY read up on post 90's way of writing javascript
[23:27:00] <Cork> that you're arguing ageist your self right now
[23:27:08] <anli> Cork: Yeah, I mean how much jquery did they not use back then
[23:27:27] <Cork> anli: unobstructive has little to do with jquery
[23:27:42] <myndzi> i've got some code that's breaking jquery but i'm not sure what it's trying to do
[23:27:46] <Cork> anli: its the difference between writing the js all over the place with inline event attributes
[23:27:57] <myndzi> it calls $('<some literal html>', $jqueryObject)
[23:28:00] <anli> I think you are incorrect, Cork
[23:28:02] <Cork> anli: compared to writing the js separately compacted with what it does
[23:28:16] <myndzi> internet tells me the second param is the context, so this statement is equivalent to $jqueryObject.find(firstparam)
[23:28:23] <myndzi> but what is it supposed to do if the first param is literal?
[23:28:38] <Cork> myndzi: thats not valid
[23:28:39] <eddiemonge> anli: and the entire web would disagree with you
[23:28:46] <anli> It is not constructive at all to say that someone is still in the 90s in any regards
[23:28:53] <nights> is there anyway i can animate from a specific height to height:auto?
[23:28:54] <eddiemonge> myndzi: whats $jqueryObject?
[23:28:57] <anli> You are the entire web then
[23:29:03] <myndzi> the result of some selector
[23:29:04] <Cork> anli: uh.. no
[23:29:18] <myndzi> i guess it's supposed to be the owning document
[23:29:25] <Cork> anli: but its clear that you don't know how to write the other form
[23:29:27] <myndzi> but i have no idea why this code is calling it without a document element
[23:29:31] <anli> If you want to argue against using attributes, you will need something more clever than that apparently
[23:29:35] <myndzi> guess i'll just remove it and see
[23:29:40] <Cork> anli: and you know how to write js in the old format
[23:29:44] <eddiemonge> anli: not related at all
[23:29:52] <anli> I never wrote js back then
[23:29:58] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: what it do son
[23:30:03] <anli> This is not even stupid
[23:30:09] <Cork> anli: but you learned from a source that prefer it
[23:30:12] <anli> No
[23:30:17] <Cork> yes
[23:30:18] <anli> You assume a lot
[23:30:23] <eddiemonge> myndzi: $('<div/>', { text: "text"}) creates a div with text of text
[23:30:40] <Cork> i assume from the lack of coherence in your argument
[23:30:48] <anli> I have strong arguments against adding event handlers on the fly, and what do you have?
[23:30:54] <eddiemonge> myndzi: $('.selector', $jQobject) means $jqobject.find('.selector')
[23:31:20] <eddiemonge> adding event handlers on the fly?
[23:31:22] <someprimetime> anli: let's hear em
[23:31:24] <myndzi> yeah, it's neither of those
[23:31:30] <myndzi> it's just creating a fragment
[23:31:37] <Cork> anli: ok, as you don't want to look it up; keep the js easy to find, and not littered all over the place; that makes it much easier to update and fine it
[23:31:42] <anli> someprimetime: I think this channel is not ready for htem
[23:31:43] <anli> them
[23:31:48] <someprimetime> haha
[23:31:50] <Cork> there are loads of other problems with the old format
[23:31:56] <Cork> but you will have to look that up your self
[23:32:06] <eddiemonge> myndzi: paste an example of what you are trying to do at jsfiddle
[23:32:31] <anli> I have a lot of arguments for using attributes, but the nice thing is that I only need to say one to convince myself
[23:32:38] <anli> I can give you one if you are willing to hear
[23:32:45] <anli> Which does not seem to be the case
[23:32:56] <eddiemonge> ok give us one
[23:33:12] <anli> My tool allows me to navigate to the function by a single key press
[23:33:29] <eddiemonge> not valid.
[23:33:34] <anli> eh, ok
[23:33:37] <anli> As I said
[23:33:42] <anli> Not ready
[23:33:51] <eddiemonge> you can do the same with all the code in a single js file attaching the event handler
[23:34:03] <Cork> ya
[23:34:13] <Cork> and you can group them based on what they are used for
[23:34:24] <Cork> instead of having to remember where in the html it was used
[23:34:27] <anli> Ah, so if there are many cliick handlers, I will navigate to them all then
[23:34:47] <Cork> anli: no, you write code for what its used for, instead of where its used
[23:34:47] <eddiemonge> anli: how do you pass params and other things to the function? what if you have lots of events? how much bloat is added to your html? are you using actual .html files or a dynamic language?
[23:35:37] <anli> I always group on where, not what
[23:35:43] <anli> As much as possible
[23:35:54] <anli> Or my project will be full of dependencies
[23:36:13] <anli> Keep the distances short is what I think
[23:36:17] <myndzi> eddiemonge: trying to understand, not do ;) i think i've got it though
[23:36:22] <nights> is there anyway i can animate from a specific height to height:auto? slideDown works well for initially hidden elements, but i would like to show a certain amount
[23:36:27] <eddiemonge> you make no sense. im going to ignore you for now and enjoy my in-n-out burger while cursing ruby, rails, rvm, homebrew and mac
[23:36:28] <myndzi> new question however: is $.proxy equivalent to function.bind ?
[23:36:34] <anli> I dont have a single images directory in a web project, for instance
[23:37:00] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy
[23:37:00] <Cork> myndzi: it does similar things, but it is quite a bit more costly
[23:37:12] <eddiemonge> nights: sigh. no bot-t. https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+animate+height+auto&aq=1&oq=jquery+animte+heigh&aqs=chrome.2.57j0l3.4982&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[23:37:26] <nights> yeah thanks i know how to google
[23:37:32] <nights> i usually do that before i ask here
[23:37:37] <myndzi> better question
[23:37:51] <myndzi> $.proxy(this, 'foo') ~= this.foo.bind(this) ?
[23:37:52] <duderion> what's is the best parallax jquery plugin in your opinion ? ^^
[23:38:00] <Cork> no
[23:38:19] <nights> duderion: just write it with canvas
[23:38:26] <eddiemonge> myndzi: have you read http://api.jquery.com/jquery.proxy/ ?
[23:38:34] <Cork> myndzi: $.proxy(foo, this) is close
[23:38:38] <myndzi> the use of the term 'context' is fuzzy to me
[23:38:58] <eddiemonge> myndzi: this is where learning the basics of javascript come in handy
[23:39:01] <Cork> myndzi: but var self = this; is a much slimmer way to do the same thing
[23:39:02] <myndzi> it looks like i'm looking at the second one: jQuery.proxy(context, name)
[23:39:08] <duderion> hm ok
[23:39:56] <myndzi> he's got lines like this: this.pane.el.mouseenter($.proxy(this, 'mouseenter'));
[23:40:15] <myndzi> i assume it's just trying to bind the event to the prototype
[23:40:35] <Cork> myndzi: ha, ya that would be the second type
[23:40:53] <myndzi> but i don't see how self = this would be equivalent, unless you mean something like
[23:41:18] <myndzi> this.pane.el.mouseenter(function (ev) { self.mouseenter(ev) })
[23:41:45] <myndzi> heh, the prototypes are stupid simple anyway
[23:41:47] <myndzi> they just toggle a variable
[23:41:53] <myndzi> i'll just inline them :P
[23:42:17] <Fuzai> http://dev.neurobots.net/beta_console/ <-- I've been trying for a while now to google an answer and trying various things, how do i set   .ui-tabs-vertical .ui-tabs-panel  width to be 100% - 12 em of parents width ?
[23:42:23] <eddiemonge> inline js is the best way to do it after all
[23:42:25] <Fuzai> i keep striking out
[23:43:20] <eddiemonge> Fuzai: box-sizing: border-box
[23:43:38] <Fuzai> that doesn't make any sense to me, but i'm googling it now
[23:43:45] <Fuzai> ty
[23:44:08] <Cork> Fuzai: it fixes the problem instead of recalculating :)
[23:44:40] <Cork> but to answer your actual question (instead of the problem you're trying to solve)
[23:44:55] <Cork> cross browser you can't do 100% - <size> yet
[23:44:58] <myndzi> aha, i think i found the problem
[23:45:01] <Cork> there is a css spec on the way for it
[23:45:02] <myndzi> he does some weird cross inheritance thing
[23:45:12] <eddiemonge> for all intents and purposes, consider all my answers as the de facto god-answer. unless i'm wrong. then correct me or ignore me.
[23:45:17] <myndzi> relying on prototype propagation from the child to the parent and also the parent to the child
[23:45:18] <myndzi> o_O
[23:45:25] <Cork> eddiemonge: lol
[23:45:47] <Cork> Fuzai: there is a spec on the way in css3 calc() that would be able to do what you want
[23:45:47] <myndzi> or maybe not blah
[23:45:53] <Cork> but its not cross browser yet
[23:46:00] <Cork> `g mdn css calc
[23:46:01] <b-ot> Cork: calc - CSS | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/calc
[23:46:17] <Fuzai> i'm actually doing this for firefox only
[23:46:30] <Fuzai> because of a bug between chrome and openshift's websocket proxy i'm limited to firefox
[23:46:51] <Fuzai> so can i use this calc thing you talk about?
[23:46:55] <Cork> well except for opera and safari all modern browsers support it
[23:47:02] <eddiemonge> Fuzai: have you tried a {display:block; } ?
[23:47:08] <Cork> sure (100% - 12em)
[23:47:20] <Cork>  calc(100% - 12em) that is
[23:47:37] <Fuzai> i haven't, i'm not smart when it comes to css  and i'm just arting to learn javascript
[23:47:53] <Fuzai> i'm a system admin that comes from perl and php ish stuff
[23:47:57] <Cork> Fuzai: you will have to use -webkit- for chrome pre 27 though
[23:48:53] <Fuzai> ty guys for all your help
[23:49:32] <Fuzai> sweet calc() worked perfectly
[23:49:35] <Fuzai> thank you!
