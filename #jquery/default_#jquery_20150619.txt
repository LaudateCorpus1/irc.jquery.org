[01:31:07] <neanderslob> hi everyone; I'm attempting to use the .inArray to compare two arrays
[01:31:18] <neanderslob> however each value keeps turning up false
[01:31:40] <neanderslob> here's my fiddle if anyone wants to check it out: http://jsfiddle.net/neanderslob/oua4of6g/7/
[01:42:50] <acidjazz> so value, array
[01:43:20] <Uhkis> neanderslob: http://jsfiddle.net/oua4of6g/9/
[01:43:26] <acidjazz> why dont i see your console.log
[01:43:43] <acidjazz> ah .toString()
[01:43:46] <Uhkis> acidjazz: its overwritten
[01:44:02] <rickthuc> any jquery expert can solve this for me ? http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/2/
[01:44:34] <neanderslob> Uhkis: ah, many thanks
[01:44:38] <Uhkis> rickthuc: ask
[01:45:01] <acidjazz> is taht the skrollr parallax lib
[01:45:25] <acidjazz> i tink you're missing the plugin itself https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr
[01:45:27] <Uhkis> oh the details were there
[01:45:48] <acidjazz> oh its in fiddle
[01:46:28] <acidjazz> oh i see you communicate via data-
[01:46:42] <rickthuc> acidjazz its there in external resources
[01:46:49] <rickthuc> thing is its not just doing anything at all
[01:47:11] <acidjazz> so skrollr detects when the offset is that value and applies that css to the div?
[01:47:30] <rickthuc> thats what its documentation says
[01:47:33] <rickthuc> data-top
[01:48:14] <acidjazz>    <h1 data-0="opacity:1;" data-500="opacity:0;">This should stick in the middle for 2-3 seconds and fadeout</h1>
[01:48:16] <acidjazz> that seems to work
[01:48:34] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/3/
[01:48:43] <acidjazz> as for sticking
[01:49:56] <rickthuc> erm its not..
[01:50:04] <rickthuc> it just fades away too fast
[01:50:38] <acidjazz> well you can cahnge the values but having that stick will take more than some css in a data-
[01:50:44] <acidjazz> you cant just position static/fixed
[01:52:45] <rickthuc> ?
[01:53:54] <rickthuc> i tried using scrollorama, but its just too heavy
[01:54:10] <acidjazz> maybe start with something like this
[01:54:12] <acidjazz> i wrote this a while ago
[01:54:18] <acidjazz> http://www.flickr12days.com/jst/parallax.js drives http://www.flickr12days.com/
[01:55:52] <acidjazz> and actually you should maybe mod that to not exactly attach to .scroll
[01:56:09] <acidjazz> http://ejohn.org/blog/learning-from-twitter/ down to the "Best Practices"
[01:56:17] <rickthuc> there's no "pinning" there..
[01:56:35] <acidjazz> yea so to pin.. say from skrollr
[01:56:47] <acidjazz> you're gonna want to swap from position: static; to position: fixed;
[01:56:59] <acidjazz> but youll also need to add properties that keep it in the same spot
[01:59:07] <acidjazz> superscrollorama is pretty intense
[01:59:41] <rickthuc> i know
[01:59:57] <rickthuc> don't know why they released plugin when they dont give proper documentation
[02:00:03] <acidjazz> all this stuff is generally pretty CPU intensive
[02:00:41] <acidjazz> the best route would be a setInterval firing, with the .scroll handler just doing something simple like resigs demo
[02:00:55] <rickthuc> i also thought of that...
[02:01:03] <acidjazz> and just remember thisll be desktop only. the .scroll handler doenst fire on phones or tablets until you lift up your finger
[02:01:05] <rickthuc> buw how would i detect a div has reached just below the header
[02:01:36] <rickthuc> i can try to set position fixed for 2 seconds and fade out
[02:01:45] <rickthuc> which is similar to this
[02:01:47] <acidjazz> you can find that in my parallax.js, you can compare scrollTop, with window height/etc
[02:02:01] <acidjazz> look at my shift function, it only runs p.move() if its in the view
[02:05:24] <miragee> Hi, here on the work i've an app that generates this code
[02:05:25] <miragee> http://pastebin.com/YYJsAtn7
[02:05:40] <miragee> i need to grab all the hours of that table, it's possible ?
[02:05:46] <rickthuc> the problem with trying custom functions is, that it will do it on position fixed, which which will disturb the other elements, so...
[02:07:10] <acidjazz> miragee: $('table > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(2)').each or something
[02:11:08] <miragee> acidjazz: let me try
[02:12:01] <acidjazz> miragee: http://jsfiddle.net/fgb2sug9/
[02:16:02] <hey_joe> i am trying to grab an input value by id whenever a text input takes a  keypress with $('#pass')..on('keyup', function() { var val = $('#pass').val(); alert(val); });, which works, however it is still one step behind each time.
[02:16:19] <acidjazz> hey_joe: keydown
[02:16:21] <hey_joe> at first i was using keypress, but then someone suggested that was the issue, but keyup yields the same results
[02:16:23] <hey_joe> same
[02:16:23] <acidjazz> hey_joe: or try keypress
[02:16:26] <hey_joe> same
[02:16:27] <hey_joe> lol
[02:16:29] <hey_joe> sry
[02:16:35] <miragee> thanks acidjazz, one more question if i've more tables there how i can associate it with that specific table ?
[02:16:36] <acidjazz> keyup fires when the key is lifted up
[02:16:58] <acidjazz> miragee: thatll pick up all tables, put something in the begining of the selector to identify them if you dont
[02:18:02] <acidjazz> hey_joe: you keydown = you pressed, keypress = character key is pressed, keyup = key is released
[02:20:18] <hey_joe> doesnt seem to function that way, still 1 character behind ://
[02:20:32] <acidjazz> fucking dieing http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/
[02:21:18] <hey_joe> i wrapped it in a small timeout and it works, strange. nevermind.
[02:21:34] <acidjazz> with keyup?
[02:21:44] <hey_joe> yeah
[02:22:02] <acidjazz> i see your problem
[02:22:10] <hey_joe> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1c2e432d7e7396f9aa95
[02:22:21] <acidjazz> $('#pass').on('keyup', function() { val = $(this).val(); });
[02:22:36] <acidjazz> use this if its bound to the input
[02:25:06] <miragee> acidjazz: something like this ? var selector = '#gridDados_ctl01 table > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(2)';
[02:26:36] <miragee> acidjazz: got it
[02:26:37] <miragee> var selector = '#gridDados_ctl01 > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(2)';
[02:28:05] <hey_joe> still behind somehow :/
[02:28:26] <hey_joe> sometimes
[02:28:28] <hey_joe> its strange.
[02:31:49] <acidjazz> miragee: do a > before table
[02:32:13] <acidjazz> hey_joe: your handler is firing before? as in running?
[02:32:26] <acidjazz> hey_joe: make it a jsfiddle
[02:32:29] <hey_joe> its on the document ready thing
[02:34:37] <acidjazz> hey_joe: http://jsfiddle.net/fgb2sug9/1/
[02:35:10] <hey_joe> if i have another input thats disabled, but changes on that input changing..
[02:35:25] <hey_joe> thats the issue i think. is a way to sense when a disable input changes dynamically via another JS?
[02:35:36] <hey_joe> like onchange?
[02:35:37] <hey_joe> lol
[02:36:06] <acidjazz> you need to jsfiddley our whole sich it sounds odd
[02:36:42] <fahadash> It should technically trigger an on-change
[02:37:56] <hey_joe> depending on how long it takes the js to update the disabled field from the other fields input (the on i was trying to fire off of), it works. but if it takes too long, i get the previous input val's result
[02:38:08] <hey_joe> so i need to sense when the disabled field changes instead.
[02:38:39] <hey_joe> its a math thing, so it can take the page a minute to solve then result into the disabled input from the input
[02:38:57] <workerbeetwo> j git
[02:39:55] <neanderslob> hey, what function would I use to trigger an action every time an object of a particular class is added/subtracted from the page?
[02:40:31] <neanderslob> (if it matters, the object is a dynamically generated div containing a form field)
[02:48:10] <neanderslob> ...or to phrase it a different way, I want to  trigger an event whenever the number of objects with a certain class changes
[02:50:40] <toomus> Hi all

[03:51:51] <miragee> can you give an example ?
[03:52:12] <decx> sure
[03:53:15] <miragee> thanks

[04:39:36] <VanReyes> Evening everyone. How can I remove second class from all td?
[04:40:34] <VanReyes> For example tr td has two p that has class. I want to remove only 2nd class from every tr td
[04:41:01] <VanReyes> This one doesn't work. $('tr td p.class:eq(1)').hide();
[04:43:37] <decx> get all p and filter from there
[04:43:51] <decx> these expression filters are weird
[04:45:29] <VanReyes> This is due to my loop. I'm looping a array, every match will be added but some match are more than 1 that's why I want to remove the duplicate
[04:45:49] <decx> eq is just very specificly about the whole collection
[04:46:19] <decx> :nth-of-type(1) or :nth-child(1) will do
[04:47:07] <decx> let's say there are 3 td with 2 p each in there, td p:eq(1) will still only select the second in that whole collection of 6 instead of 3
[04:48:39] <VanReyes> I've tried it
[04:48:45] <VanReyes> Please check this code
[04:48:45] <VanReyes> http://bin.fuelphp.com/~KM
[04:51:17] <VanReyes> eq is not working for me
[04:52:45] <decx> well i just explained that
[04:53:02] <VanReyes> No solution?
[04:53:30] <decx> there is
[04:54:00] <VanReyes> Can you please share if you have?
[04:58:34] <decx> $('tr td .gracal').filter(function () { return $(this).prev('.gracal').length }).hide()
[04:58:45] <decx> that's probably the most markup agnostic way i can think of at the moment
[04:59:41] <VanReyes> Thanks decx,
[04:59:45] <VanReyes> But it's not working :(
[05:00:24] <VanReyes> Ohh great
[05:00:27] <VanReyes> It works.
[05:00:35] <VanReyes> THANKS DECX

[05:58:18] <dimi1947> I have a q/problem about document.ready....what ever changes are applied to the DOM with JS are applied after the document is ready...this creates the problem that the user has a glimpse before the DOM is "painted....is there anything I can do to prevent this?"
[06:07:07] <dimi1947> if for example a div is white and after doc.ready becomes red....the user...for a fraction of a second sees it white
[06:07:55] <rickthuc> dimi, one of the thing which many use is a "loading screen"
[06:09:57] <dimi1947> what is that?
[06:11:03] <SteenJobs> hey guys, i’m using the jquery resizeable api for the first time and was wondering how i can restrict the minimum size of the resizeable container to the size of the image it contains.
[06:11:09] <dimi1947> I will search it
[06:13:04] <decx> use the minWidth property and fill it with the width of your image
[06:13:59] <SteenJobs> decx: that’s what i thought, but how do i grab the width and height of my image dynamically? i’m kinda new to jquery
[06:15:46] <decx> get your image before you do .resizable()
[06:16:44] <SteenJobs> decx: but how do i obtain its size attributes
[06:16:56] <decx> .width()/.height()
[06:17:21] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/L7z8nrns/
[06:17:33] <SteenJobs> decx: thanks brother!!
[06:17:45] <SteenJobs> decx: one other question, is there a way to hide overflow for the image, but show overflow for the handles?
[06:18:20] <rickthuc> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/4/ anybody can do this?
[06:18:22] <decx> there won't be overflow if you restrict the size to the image dimensons tho?
[06:19:31] <SteenJobs> decx: ah fair point, so i can just set overflow to visible for the entire div
[06:20:04] <decx> try it
[06:20:28] <SteenJobs> decx: cool! it worked. what about getting the resizeable container to begin its size as the size of the image it contains?
[06:20:41] <SteenJobs> decx: p.s., learning this is starting to be incredibly fun
[06:21:06] <SteenJobs> decx: oh…now making the container larger isn’t having an effect on the image :(
[06:24:33] <miragee> decx: can you use this example to help me out ? http://jsfiddle.net/fgb2sug9/6/
[06:28:04] <decx> no guarantees ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/fgb2sug9/7/
[06:29:24] <rickthuc> decx: how about this
[06:29:25] <rickthuc> http://jsfiddle.net/qut5gcpd/4/
[06:30:08] <decx> use the skrollr docs i have no idea about it
[06:30:18] <decx> there is no js in there
[06:32:04] <rickthuc> ?
[06:32:15] <decx> exactly
[06:32:19] <decx> my expression as well
[06:35:45] <rickthuc> skrollr doesn't really need js
[06:37:00] <miragee> decx: thanks

[06:53:05] <alex88> hi guys, is it possible to have a different "this" inside a jquery callback?
[06:54:17] <alex88> since I've an object like { onInsert: $(element).on('something', this.onSomething), onDelete: $(element).off('something', this.onSomething), onSomething: function(e) { this??? }) and I want to be able to have the object instance inside the callback function
[06:54:50] <ansikt> alex88: checkout $.proxy()
[06:55:44] <alex88> mmhh but that creates another function, so I can't do an "off" later, since I don't have the reference to that function

[06:56:27] <notchris> I just want to check a value of a div
[06:56:55] <notchris> All the examples I’ve found just show how to load the external content into a div
[06:56:58] <Uhkis> just dont add it? :D
[06:57:25] <notchris> $('#mainContainer').load(‘example.html #example’);
[06:57:32] <notchris> I don’t want to load the content into a div
[06:57:38] <Uhkis> use .get
[06:57:44] <notchris> Ahhh
[07:00:23] <notchris> OK so I did
[07:00:24] <notchris> $.get( "crm_details.asp #tab_membership", function( data ) {
[07:00:30] <notchris> But it doesn’t just get #tab_membership
[07:00:33] <notchris> It gets the whole page...
[07:08:13] <Uhkis> $(data).find('#tab_membership')
[07:15:40] <Lope> how can I delete the first element? http://jsfiddle.net/fLaqycog/
[07:16:25] <Lope> okay, this works: $a.eq(0).remove();
[07:17:25] <Lope> I notice $a.length doesn't change.
[07:20:04] <Lope> so I just refresh my selector variable.
[07:25:30] <decx> hu til, remove doesnt remove from a collection reference

The options I see are 1.)  data-id=1 on the anchor tag, then a click handler to get the ID, ajax the

[11:07:11] <rodney77> hello, I want to trigger a function only if the user is on a desktop, not a mobile device
[11:07:39] <rodney77> can someone tell me how to do this? the function is written, I just need to know how to set the condition
[11:13:36] <rodney77> nevermind, i figured it out: less css handle the media querying, and check for a desktop-specific css value to trigger the function
[11:26:07] <sepoki> How bad is if I use the FOR attribute in a INPUT element, just for semantics and jquery usage ?
[11:39:21] <adv_> how can i get the first field of a json obj?
[11:45:46] <SteenJobs> can anyone help with the clone helper for jquery draggable?
[11:57:39] <SteenJobs> i can’t get my cloned draggable to move again once it lands on the droppable
[12:12:51] <morissette> How do you pass json to a DELETE method request?
[12:15:23] <_biff> what does it mean element.dispatchEvent is not a function...its always showing from prototye.js
[12:16:58] <looker> $.ajax({
[12:16:58] <looker>     url: '/User/Delete',
[12:16:58] <looker>     dataType: "json",
[12:16:58] <looker>     type: "DELETE",
[12:16:58] <looker>     contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
[12:16:59] <looker>     data: JSON.stringify({id: 20}),
[12:16:59] <looker>     async: true,
[12:17:00] <looker>     processData: false,
[12:17:00] <looker>     cache: false,
[12:17:01] <looker>     success: function (data) {
[12:17:01] <looker>         alert(data);
[12:17:02] <looker>     },
[12:17:02] <looker>     error: function (xhr) {
[12:17:03] <looker>         alert('error');
[12:20:01] <acidjazz> dood you guise
[12:20:09] <acidjazz> why arent we all using http://html9responsiveboilerstrapjs.com/
[12:20:19] <acidjazz> i cant stop loling at this
[12:22:23] <Wes-_> acidjazz: I don' t know why you're loling, I have been using this for a week and it's great!
[12:25:18] <acidjazz> what am i waiting for??
[12:35:37] <Uhkis> acidjazz: more like painfully true
[12:36:30] <alevroub> the issues are just as hilarious
[12:36:32] <alevroub> "Responsiveness issues when punching the screen"
[12:41:22] <Wes-_> alevroub: you can work around that with window.ontouchstart = function(ev) { if (ev.touches.length > 3) { ev.stopPropagation(); ev.preventDefault() };
[12:43:33] <alaing> good evening all
[12:44:10] <looker> good al
[12:44:34] <alaing> any jquery issues out there tonight?
[12:47:05] <beefKitten> Does $.each($(selector), function() { console.info($(this)); }) also parse the DOM from top to bottom?
[12:47:19] <beefKitten> also -> always* oops
[12:55:56] <beefKitten> I presume the results are returned in the order they appear in the tree
[13:12:43] <alaing> beefKitten: you are correct
[13:21:42] <beefKitten> alaing: thanks, just wanted to confirm. I believe the vanilla getElementsByClassname returns a node list in order as well
[13:22:08] <alaing> yeah i think it will also do that
[13:23:02] <alaing> beefKitten: i dont think it would if you using cached selectors and then use .add()
[13:38:30] <acidjazz> alaing: lol nice find
[13:38:51] <alaing> acidjazz: thanks
[13:39:27] <alaing> any jquery questions? like whats the meaning of life;-)
[13:39:40] <acidjazz> "Doesn't completely build my site for me"
[13:39:51] <acidjazz> sorry alaing i meant alevroub
[13:40:04] <SteenJobs> is there any way to make custom handles appear only after a draggable item is placed on a droppable?
[13:40:37] <alaing> yes
[13:40:47] <alevroub> the real question is, who the hell knows how pushstate works
[13:40:52] <SteenJobs> alaing: how??
[13:41:11] <acidjazz> Is this web-scale and can I use it with Big Data? Thanks
[13:41:18] <alaing> SteenJobs: i take it you using jquery ui
[13:41:22] <SteenJobs> alaing: correct
[13:41:26] <acidjazz> alevroub: ive been having a ton of fun with SNS
[13:41:46] <SteenJobs> alaing: i’m brand new to it, and trying to implement some fancy features - do you think when i’m done i can gist you my code just to make sure there isn’t a much simpler way to do what i’m implemnting?
[13:41:56] <alaing> SteenJobs: there is an event if fires one the dragged item is placed
[13:42:20] <alaing> in that event you can maybe use addclass to add a css class that changes the handle
[13:42:34] <SteenJobs> right but the problem is, if i’m using custom handles i need to specifiy them in my html - so they appear before any dragging occurs
[13:42:37] <SteenJobs> i’ll gist it to you
[13:42:55] <alaing> sure maybe use jsfiddle or codepen
[13:43:09] <alaing> thats gives us an interactive example of your code
[13:44:53] <SteenJobs> alaing: ha i’m so used to gisting for rails i forgot about jsfiddle
[13:45:06] <alaing> lol
[13:45:26] <alaing> SteenJobs: easily done
[13:46:09] <SteenJobs> alaing: this is my first time here actually, i’m always in the rails chat - but wanted to really brush up on jquery
[13:46:49] <alaing> I'm in a similar boat....I need to learn rails
[13:47:19] <alaing> SteenJobs: the event you want to listen out for is the stop event
[13:47:33] <SteenJobs> alaing: sounds like a good team up right here
[13:47:40] <SteenJobs> alaing: my problem is the html tags for the custom handles. here:
[13:47:49] <alaing> SteenJobs: http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#events

[13:59:14] <tds5016> .ckear
[13:59:39] <tds5016> hi all. I'm trying to use grunt/browserify and I'm trying to use the highcharts plugin. Does anyone know the right way to do that?
[14:13:14] <itsme> I need some help with a jQuery and Prototype.js conflict
[14:15:32] <itsme> using the latest jQuery 1.11.3 and prototype.js 1.7.2
[14:15:47] <itsme> when I use an ajax call
[14:16:00] <itsme> by doing $.ajax(...)
[14:17:02] <itsme> at some point it calls a function inside of prototype.js
[14:17:07] <itsme> toColorPart()
[14:17:12] <itsme> to be precise
[14:18:10] <itsme> I believe this might be a bug
[14:18:39] <itsme> there's even a StackOverflow question about this with 3 votes and 1 star
[14:18:42] <itsme> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16455678/this-topaddedstring-is-not-a-function-prototype
[14:19:09] <itsme> but no answers
[14:23:26] <itsme> for anyone wondering, I included Prototype first
[14:23:34] <itsme> then jQuery
[14:23:41] <itsme> and used jQuery.noConflict();
[14:24:28] <itsme> I hope you guys will shed some light into this issue
[14:34:44] <Lencl> I'm using a datepicker widget on jquery mobile. On here:
[14:35:08] <Lencl> http://76.79.253.139/~midev1/miwebsite/?id=2 <-- if you click edit left column > add event... you'll notice clicking on the header gives the datepicker popup
[14:35:16] <Lencl> why would it do that?
[15:40:38] <LindsayMac> Having the weirdest issue right now. Well, two of them, but starting by tackling one. This script http://jsfiddle.net/ehaL28vg/1/ somehow is telling me that my Node is only 8 long but I can't figure out where it's getting that number from.
[15:50:11] <monk3y> LindsayMac: heheh.  How many characters are in the literal string "#selectable".
[15:50:17] <monk3y> I count .. 11.
[15:51:05] <monk3y> I think you want $("#selectable")'s content's length.
[15:51:54] <monk3y> (so .text() in this case might do it, but you might have to do something more complex depending on the future requirements)
[15:52:44] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  yep I got it!
[15:52:48] <LindsayMac> .text().length
[15:52:52] <LindsayMac> plus the missing $
[15:52:56] <monk3y> Yep.
[15:53:01] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  got it as you were typing.
[15:53:18] <monk3y> Oh man, do I still get points?? * **
[15:53:28] <monk3y> * I understand there are no points
[15:53:29] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  yup.. and bonus if you can help me with the second part
[15:53:37] <LindsayMac> (assuming the second part is still an issue after fixing this)
[15:53:40] <monk3y> Oh noes .. more parts?  I was going to retire.
[15:53:54] <LindsayMac> lol
[15:54:02] <monk3y> Alrighty, lemme know if/when it's broken!
[15:54:09] <LindsayMac> yea second part is stil an issue monk3y :(
[15:54:16] <LindsayMac> Why doesnt any of this work on the mobile safar?
[15:54:20] <LindsayMac> safari*
[15:54:34] <monk3y> .. 'cause it's Safari? </obviousTroll>
[15:54:40] <LindsayMac> hahaa yea
[15:54:59] <monk3y> Well update the fiddle and let us know where/how it's breaking.
[15:55:20] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/ehaL28vg/2/
[15:56:53] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  its weird because it loads it and it returns the proper number of chars but it does not select the text
[15:57:11] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  so I am guessing there is something I have to do to trigger a text selection in mobile that is different that desktop?
[15:58:05] <monk3y> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3272089/programmatically-selecting-text-in-an-input-field-on-ios-devices-mobile-safari ?
[15:58:32] <monk3y> (I know your fiddle isn't dealing with an input field, but it seems similar..)
[15:58:35] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  that seems to only work on text inputs and not text inside of a container
[15:58:42] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  oits not. Already tried it
[15:58:49] <monk3y> D'oh.
[15:59:49] <monk3y> :/ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26129094/mobile-safari-cannot-select-text-or-copy-to-clipboard
[16:00:39] <LindsayMac> monk3y: umm.. that seems to have to do with adsense and the like.
[16:00:54] <LindsayMac> monk3y:  has nothing to do with my issue..
[16:02:11] <monk3y> My apologies.  I thought "mobile safari cannot select text" might have been a 'lead'.
[16:02:15] <monk3y> *shrug*
[16:02:57] <LindsayMac> worth reading before posting. Im capable of googling by myself TBH
[16:59:20] <jquery345> Anyone use Skrollr here?
[17:32:06] <grp066> I'm using just HTML/CSS to make a little 'scene' where there's a dude standing on the left, some text over his head, and bigger monster on the right side... I'm trying to make these images responsive so that as I scale the browser down, the images scales down nicely. Should I insert these images in <img> tags? Or use css background images?
[17:33:21] <ezio> is there a promise that always executes?
[18:54:42] <christech2> Is there a way to alert the value of $(this) ? I've tried alert($(this).html()); nothing is displayed.
[18:59:58] <rcyr> Nobody uses alert to debug, we all use console.log + the javascript console
[19:00:07] <rcyr> ... of your favorite browser
[19:07:52] <christech2> rcyr: how do I display value of $(this) in console?
[19:08:08] <rcyr> console.log($(this)); ?
[19:14:52] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/331pzyw3/1/ So... why is the whole object being replaced, instead of creating 'onSomething:[{key:'setVar', params:[{name:'rollChance', value:100}]}, {key:'setVar', params:[{name:'rollChance', value:40}]}]' ? http://jsfiddle.net/331pzyw3/2/  Is there another solution I should be looking at for deep object combining? I want arrays to be merged, not replaced.
[19:34:55] <christech2> rcyr: thanks
[21:38:00] <Ntrope> Hi, I've just finished my first js project, mostly with jquery, and would like some feedback on anything I might be doing wrong, inefficiently, or non-standard. Here is the .js http://pastebin.com/Def87tvu Here is the .html http://pastebin.com/zJGt8p7G line 34 of the javascript file is one I would like criticism on particularly because JSHint says it's not an efficient query.
[21:38:35] <Ntrope> ... also, this is a quiz application
[21:39:58] <Ntrope> http://pastebin.com/g9k1QmCk and this is the project prompt
[22:29:03] <al-damiri> How to check/see if all checkboxes in a table are checked/unchecked?
[22:34:44] <Razerglass> hello if i used javascript to change some colors in a <td> if i wanted to change them back to their previous color what is easiest way to do so
[23:15:08] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[23:15:17] <phiz> good evening
[23:15:40] <al-damiri> I have list of checkboxes which I got by doing; var checkboxes = $(this).closest('table').find(':checkbox');
[23:19:04] <al-damiri> How do I get then the count of all checked boxes from this checkboxes variable?
[23:21:00] <phiz> .length
[23:21:56] <al-damiri> phiz: "checkboxes" has all the checkboxes (whether checked or unchecked.)
[23:22:07] <phiz> var totalCheckboxes = $('input:checkbox').length;
[23:22:23] <al-damiri> phiz: how do I use this checkboxes variable to get the checked checkboxes?
[23:22:33] <phiz> var numberOfChecked = $('input:checkbox:checked').length;
[23:22:59] <al-damiri> phiz: Won't this get all the checkboxes in the page?
[23:23:09] <phiz> i'm sure you can adjust as necessary
[23:23:32] <al-damiri> phiz: I want only want to check the count from this checkboxes variable which I got by var checkboxes = $(this).closest('table').find(':checkbox');
[23:25:53] <phiz> al-damiri: post jsfiddle
[23:28:35] <al-damiri> phiz: http://jsfiddle.net/wdbujn8q/
[23:29:03] <al-damiri> phiz: http://jsfiddle.net/wdbujn8q/1/
[23:29:20] <phiz> heh I don't see any html
[23:29:24] <al-damiri> My bad, I have written Python comments (#) in JS.
[23:29:32] <al-damiri> phiz: There isn't any need.
[23:29:40] <phiz> if you say so
[23:29:42] <al-damiri> From the checkboxes variable.
[23:29:57] <al-damiri> Which I have, is it possible to count the checked ones?
[23:30:49] <al-damiri> phiz: I know I can do another $(:checked) call and find out. But is it possible to use this checkboxes variable?
[23:30:50] <phiz> I posted a solution that works, I am not going to try to figure out your problem if you are going to be lazy
[23:31:00] <al-damiri> phiz: Like checkboxes.find(':checked').length ?
[23:31:23] <phiz> try .find('input[type="checkbox"]:checked')
[23:32:43] <al-damiri> phiz: Nope; checkboxes.find('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').length -> returns 0.
[23:45:40] <phiz> http://jsfiddle.net/m5k1gdL7/
[23:54:37] <al-damiri> phiz: Thanks, sorry I was away. Let me check.
