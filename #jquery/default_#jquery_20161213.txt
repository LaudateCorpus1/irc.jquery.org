[00:01:42] <DX^> anyone around? I asked in angular but seems dead, I'm trying to integrate angular-route into an existing jquery template
[00:01:49] <DX^> not working out so well, are there any tricks I should be aware of
[00:03:37] <vinxz> Hi guys, I got a problem with this: http://pastebin.com/raw/EwLvhYfv . The console answer me with Uncaught ReferenceError, why?
[00:09:00] <vinxz> Sorry guys the page in url i posted before works. The console answer me with Uncaught ReferenceError with this page http://pastebin.com/raw/jgKfweF4
[00:19:46] <vinxz> No one can help?
[03:37:46] <lordjancso> how can i convert a jquery object to a html string if that object already manipulated with jquery?
[03:37:54] <lordjancso> for example i added an 'attr' for it
[03:38:22] <lordjancso> if i call .html() i will get back the original html string without the newly added 'attr'
[04:12:23] <Cork> lordjancso: firstly, unless you plan to send the html somewhere you should avoid converting back and forth between html and dom
[04:12:46] <Cork> lordjancso: also as long as you actually store the resulting dom object after the manipulation it would give it to you with .html()
[04:13:01] <Cork> lordjancso: make a jsfiddle.net showing what you have problem with
[06:40:18] <Torrone> hello, I have an exteral script that loads an image on the page, I need to listen for when that image is appended/is loaded but .on and .delegate don't seem to be working, what do?
[06:40:36] <padde_> Hey, is there any way to catch exceptions caused by invalid inline javascript when using $element.html(data)? made me crazy today and referred to the sources, it will just catch the error without any processing?
[06:52:24] <Tennis> Is it via ajax Torrone?
[06:52:50] <Torrone> Tennis, It's appended by other people's code
[06:53:13] <Torrone> and by that I mean that it's literally an external javascript file I can't touch
[07:00:43] <AdamPDotty> hmm, at least if that script works synchronous, you can work with .then()
[07:32:16] <richardlampitt> Hello all - Datepicker issue I'm having: I've got a few date fields that are using datepicker, all using the UK 'd/m/Y' format; but when I'm pulling data from my database to populate the fields, datepicker is only displaying the dates if they would make sense as US format (m/d/Y), as well as converting them into US format. So for example, I've got a date of 1st December 2016, written in the...
[07:32:18] <richardlampitt> ...field as 01/12/2016. When pulling that date from the database and trying to display it, it will display it as 12th January 2016, or 12/01/2016. I've attempted altering the date format to ISO, and changing the separation marks, but so far no luck. Can anyone advise?
[07:45:48] <RenokK> .:richardlampitt:. Maybe take a look at moment.js, see if it will help you? http://momentjs.com/ But if you know the format your dates have, and they are needed in? Why not just split dem and move them around?
[07:47:50] <richardlampitt> I'm working with a heavily developed system already, I'd need to pass changing the date picking functionality up to the lead developer, who's busy with other things. How do you mean splitting them up and moving them around? Datepicker treats the entire value of the input field as a string as far as I can see.
[07:50:40] <RenokK> What lib are you using for the datepicker? Most of them have a locale file somewhere. Using "en" for US Formats and "en-gb" for UK. But i guess you already looked into that?..
[07:52:37] <richardlampitt> Not sure, let me check
[08:11:03] <richardlampitt> RenokK: I assume from here: //code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.js
[08:30:26] <sdwrage> Is there a good way I can attach a click on an element whenever it finally shows up in the dom?
[08:43:00] <mar77i> derp. can I use calc() in .css()?
[08:46:30] <shoky_> mar77i: yep
[08:49:38] <shoky_> sdwrage: event delegation. read about it in docs for .on()
[08:50:31] <sdwrage> shoky_, I ended up just sticking it in the view that I am calling in via ajax :P
[08:50:33] <sdwrage> worked well
[09:33:47] <Duikb00t> yo
[09:34:10] <Duikb00t> I have a question on a page link  in html I am doing <a href="admin/registrations/#104">xyz</a>
[09:34:35] <Duikb00t> How can I make sure on admin/registration/#104 I can do an action on it? ( I have to  'dropdown') the details of a row
[09:34:39] <Duikb00t> slidedown*
[09:34:52] <Duikb00t> I have that logic already but... I have no clue how to do that when coming from an other page.
[09:41:14] <Torrone> hello, I have an exteral script that loads an image on the page, I need to listen for when that image is appended/is loaded but .on and .delegate don't seem to be working, what do?
[09:45:48] <mar77i> I'm doing the weirdest stuff here, I have no idea why browsers need a callback for setting up a layout as they do.
[09:47:47] <mar77i> await = function(test_cb, cb) { var to = 20, intvid; if(arguments.length > 2) to = arguments[2]; intvid = setInterval(function() { if(test_cb()) { clearInterval(intvid); cb; } }, to) }
[09:50:37] <shoky_> cb;  doesn't do anything
[09:59:50] <Cork> Torrone: the best option is to see if the script provides a callback or similar that you can hook into
[10:00:12] <Torrone> Cork, I know, but it doesn't look like it does
[10:00:14] <Cork> Torrone: alternatively see if there is a function you can wrap in it
[10:00:32] <Cork> and if none of those exist, the only other option is mutation observers
[10:00:39] <Cork> but those are messy to deal with
[10:00:57] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[10:01:40] <Torrone> Cork, yeah, I've read that they're not exactly hyper compatible
[10:02:06] <Cork> ya, and they cause a lot of load on the page
[10:02:28] <Cork> so i would really recommend looking closer at how the external script is structured
[10:04:23] <mar77i> heh, I'm having trouble with dns servers and irc here.
[10:04:37] <mar77i> (sorry for the reconnection noise)
[10:34:11] <Bhushan> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js
[10:34:13] <Bhushan> Its not working
[10:34:21] <Bhushan> anyone know whats the issue
[10:35:58] <MassDebates> Bhushan:  That link doesn't help anyone assist you.
[10:36:37] <MassDebates> Bhushan:  Are you working on a http://codepen.io or http://jsfiddle.net that you can link to? Can you share your website URL where there's a problem?
[10:37:04] <MassDebates> Bhushan:  What's happening? What is different between what you want/expect to happen and what is actually going on?
[10:37:53] <Bhushan> The min version for 1.12.4 is not working with https
[10:37:56] <Bhushan> https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js
[10:37:59] <Bhushan> access this link
[10:38:07] <Bhushan> it works with https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js
[10:38:13] <Bhushan> http is working
[10:38:36] <Bhushan> We cant deploy new version due to some lockdown policy so hoping this to work
[10:43:49] <MassDebates> Bhushan:  I'm able to access both on https and http
[10:44:03] <MassDebates> Bhushan:  Do you have a link to where it's not working or no?
[10:45:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ccu1hsr1/ works for me
[10:46:24] <taplar> someone else was having an issue with the cdn yesterday.  robert advised the person to flush their dns cache.  they did this, released and renewed, and after a moment the cdn worked for them
[10:47:11] <Bhushan> GET https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js net::ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
[10:47:24] <Bhushan> I am getting this with the fiddle @taplar
[10:47:25] <taplar> yeah, try doing the dns flush and etc
[10:47:42] <Bhushan> DNS flush where ?
[10:47:49] <Bhushan> I am getting this on all machines
[10:47:56] <Bhushan> even on Mobile network
[10:48:04] <taplar> not entirely sure.  i'd have to goggle
[10:48:37] <taplar> but it is working for me, and it seems the same for MassDebates so there is something between you and the cdn that is dorked
[10:48:44] <taplar> *it would seem
[10:48:47] <Bhushan> Are you in USA ?
[10:48:50] <taplar> yes
[10:49:41] <Bhushan> If it did worked on mobile then I would have known that its the issue with our network.
[10:49:51] <Bhushan> But none of the Min versions working for me.
[10:49:59] <Bhushan> Its saying to many redirects
[10:50:13] <hlve> there are indeed, too many redirects
[10:50:31] <Bhushan> Good we have one more @hlve
[10:51:13] <MassDebates> Bhushan:  What is your current country location?
[10:51:15] <hlve> does http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js also give you the same error?
[10:51:18] <hlve> non https
[10:51:37] <dmcdaniel> Hey all, I’m having a bit of trouble with the jquery UI sortable. When I use it, it selects all tr rows. I’m adding tr dynamically, and calling the sortable(‘refresh’) after each row is added
[10:51:43] <taplar> you might also try #jquery-infrastructure and see if they have any ideas
[10:53:05] <Bhushan> No https works
[10:53:10] <Bhushan> sorry http works
[10:53:17] <Bhushan> only https giving issue
[10:54:16] <dmcdaniel> Sounds like a cors issue
[11:00:02] <dmcdaniel> wierd. Looks like: { items: 'tr:has(td)', connectWith: 'tbody' } fixed my issue w/ the refresh
[11:00:03] <dmcdaniel> }
[11:00:44] <dglambert> yo
[11:15:12] <rominronin> hi
[11:17:20] <rominronin> syncing audio in browsers - anyone got experience with that?
[11:36:09] <jquery234> What would be the easiest way to send 3 variables to a separate page with JS?
[11:36:36] <jquery234> I'm looking into cookies, but don't exactly understand how to write them
[11:36:41] <taplar> how does the first page reach the second page?
[11:37:01] <jquery234> Redirect on Form Submission
[11:37:35] <taplar> so you submit the form and then the server redirects?
[11:37:43] <jquery234> Yeah
[11:37:47] <renecum> Hi, I'm using jquery-1.12.4 from here https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js and for some reason I get a ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS, does this happen to you too?
[11:37:58] <taplar> then you could potentially put the info on the redirect url as params
[11:38:20] <taplar> renecum: try #jquery-infrastructure to see if you get any info there
[11:38:35] <jquery234> Do I still need to drop a cookie?
[11:38:36] <renecum> thanks <taplar>
[11:38:50] <taplar> jquery234: you don't have to do a cookie if you put it on the params
[11:38:54] <jquery234> or just add my variables as &varname
[11:38:59] <taplar> boom
[11:39:19] <taplar> otherwise other options are available like sessionStorage/localStorage
[11:39:53] <jquery234> I thought of local storage, but in the context of this page, I don't think people will need to see it for so long
[11:40:04] <jquery234> if I local storage, can you set an expiry date?
[11:40:14] <taplar> i think so?
[11:40:23] <taplar> but sessionStorage is removed when the browser closes
[11:41:18] <jquery234> So, which do you think will work better, I have 3 vars, first name/last name and a fluctuating "total number"
[11:41:36] <jquery234> if a user comes back, chances are names will be the same, but total number might change
[11:42:20] <taplar> either the sessionStorage or params could work
[11:42:28] <taplar> params would be less persistent
[11:43:13] <taplar> or, how critical is this information?
[11:44:10] <jquery234> first and last would be the only personal info of a user, total number would be arbitrary and isnt personal info
[11:44:26] <taplar> i mean critical as in tamper proof
[11:45:04] <jquery234> Define tamper, like someone changing their total number?
[11:45:27] <taplar> yep.  a user can easily change the url.  also slightly savy users can change sessionStorage through the console or debugger
[11:45:56] <jquery234> So, we store the number in a database as well, so once it submits, changing the url will just change score on screen
[11:46:23] <DX^> anyone have experience using angular with jquery?
[11:46:32] <DX^> I added angular-route to my template and all my jquery hit the fan
[11:46:44] <taplar> jquery234: so if they changed the url to a different name or score it's not a biggie?
[11:47:16] <jquery234> Nope, as ,long as it doesn't get pushed to the db
[11:47:43] <taplar> ok, so either one may be ok for you
[11:49:26] <taplar> DX^: you might be more targeted information from #angularjs
[11:53:21] <DX^> taplar: I've tried there but they are dead
[11:53:32] <DX^> and/or don't have an interest/time in helping me, lol
[11:53:43] <taplar> :(
[11:54:05] <DX^> really annoying, because this was working fine until I added ng-route to add some dynamic page loading
[11:54:19] <DX^> and now none of the buttons work, so I think angular is interfering with DOM binding somewhere
[11:54:31] <jquery234> jSorry went to talk to a colleague on this as well. I think LS might be best incase they come back to the URL. Thanks for the help
[11:54:51] <taplar> np
[12:02:40] <jquery234> Hey Taplar, does this look correct? https://jsfiddle.net/9ho2m09c/
[12:03:06] <taplar> yep
[12:03:29] <taplar> though if you wanted to, someone showed me a little while back that you can use dot notation with session/local storage too
[12:04:17] <taplar> i vividly remember it cause i was like YOU CAN'T DO THAT!! and they provided the documentation and i felt like a bum, lol
[12:04:32] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:05:33] <jquery234> I've never tried it, do you have an example
[12:05:46] <taplar> it'd just be localStorage.whatever= value;
[12:05:54] <taplar> var blah = localStorage.whatever;
[12:05:59] <taplar> normal dot notation
[12:06:21] <jquery234> Oh word, I gotcha! Thanks for the tip!
[12:07:18] <taplar> brb
[12:13:03] <robertmaxrees> http://radio.garden/ neat
[12:14:09] <z1haze> how can i check if a click event is already bound to an element?
[12:14:29] <robertmaxrees> before we go that route, z1haze why do you want to know that?
[12:14:35] <taplar_food> robertmaxrees: what is this site?  or do i need earbuds?
[12:15:00] <robertmaxrees> taplar_food earbuds - lets you tune into radio stations just by looking at them.
[12:15:01] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:15:13] <taplar_food> huh
[12:15:23] <z1haze> its for a co workers, i dont really know all of the details.. he has a function that runs on click but he says he only wants it to run once, and somehow its getting rebinded.. i think its inside a function that gets called multiple times
[12:15:35] <taplar_food> looking at them.  mobile device or webcam needed?
[12:15:45] <robertmaxrees> taplar_food nah it's a globe.
[12:15:58] <robertmaxrees> spin the globe, put the crosshairs over a station.
[12:15:59] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[12:16:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze then he should use .once() or, even better, a delegated listener that doesn't get re-bound.
[12:16:33] <taplar_food> ahhh, my ghostery was fubaring it
[12:16:47] <z1haze> i just told him to run off() right before he called it :\ just to see if that fixes his issue?
[12:17:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a good solution.
[12:17:02] <z1haze> i know thats pretty hacky
[12:17:04] <robertmaxrees> fix the multiple bindings instead.
[12:17:24] <z1haze> well im not there, and im home sick just trying to give a temp solution until i can get back
[12:17:41] <robertmaxrees> it's a great learning opportunity for them ;)
[12:17:49] <z1haze> what is this once() you were talking about, that sounds useful
[12:18:03] <robertmaxrees> or maybe it's .one()
[12:18:07] <robertmaxrees> check the api docs.
[12:18:11] <taplar_food> one()
[12:18:15] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:18:28] <robertmaxrees> but if you ca use that instead, you can fix your code to not require it
[12:18:45] <taplar_food> one() is great for delaying initialization on a ton of elements
[12:18:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:19:09] <taplar_food> like if you have a page with a ton of things you'd initialize datepicker or autocomplete on
[12:19:21] <taplar_food> only initializing on focus one() can increase initial load time
[12:19:43] <robertmaxrees> ah
[12:20:15] <taplar_food> and if they never focus, you didn't initialize for nothing, :)
[12:20:36] * taplar_food rocking out to this page
[12:20:38] <taplar_food> nice find
[12:53:34] <jquery118> Hey Taplar, so I used that local storage, and I can store the number, but for my form value of first/last name I keep getting "[object HTMLInputElement]"
[12:53:46] <jquery118> any ideas?
[12:54:05] <taplar> val() is giving you that?
[12:54:15] <jquery118> Yes I believe so
[12:54:19] <jquery118> var playersFirstName = $("#playersFirstName").val();
[12:54:32] <jquery118> do I need to stringify it?
[12:54:34] <taplar> console.log(playersFirstName);
[12:56:07] <jquery118> So I console log it in my script and it returns the right thing
[12:56:21] <jquery118> but if i console log it from inspect, I get
[12:56:22] <jquery118> console.log(playersFirstName); VM2108:2 <input type=​"text" class=​"form-control" id=​"playersFirstName" placeholder=​"Your First Name" requried>​ undefined
[12:56:35] <taplar> that's weird
[12:56:51] <taplar> console.log($.fn.jquery, jQuery.fn.jquery)
[12:57:12] * AdamPDotty does not even know the requried attribute
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> AdamPDotty it's an html deal for form validation.
[12:58:15] <jquery118> 1.7.1 1.7.1 undefined
[12:58:37] <taplar> undefined when you put it in your console?
[12:58:42] <jquery118> yup
[12:58:56] <taplar> so for some reason your console doesn't know what jQuery is
[12:59:06] <robertmaxrees> module loader?
[12:59:21] <robertmaxrees> or noconflict.
[12:59:30] <jquery118> OH shit
[12:59:39] <jquery118> im on a temporary preview url
[12:59:41] <jquery118> 1 sec
[13:00:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:00:38] <DX^> is there anyway to find out why my bound .on()'s do not work?
[13:00:47] <DX^> a debugger tool more advanced than Chrome/Firefox?
[13:00:52] <DX^> I added angular and a bunch of shit hit th efan
[13:01:07] <DX^> and I can't figure out a way to debug it because the template I'm using has 30 scripts in it
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> DX^ errr...
[13:01:49] <DX^> ?
[13:01:51] <jquery118> Hmm, not sure taking it off temp url didnt fix it
[13:02:16] <robertmaxrees> the debugger in ff and chrome are pretty solid.  angular does some stank though.
[13:02:54] <DX^> yeah, and I'm having trouble resolving the problem
[13:03:03] <DX^> its like angular has somehow interfered with jquery dom binding
[13:03:04] <robertmaxrees> so your bound handlers might be breaking because elements are getting added/removed out from under you.
[13:03:27] <DX^> hmm
[13:03:46] <DX^> here's what it supposed to look like: http://www.shutterstiles.com/alpha/product-details-style5-2.html
[13:03:50] <taplar> i'm by no means an angular guy, but from what i've seen typically with angular you use their bindings like ng-click and such, rather than the jquery bindings
[13:04:01] <robertmaxrees> that being said, traditionally once you bring in angular, you swap to using it instead of jquery.
[13:04:03] <DX^> after I add angular-route, it looks like this: http://www.shutterstiles.com/alpha/#/product-details
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> is angular-route ajaxing content in?
[13:04:24] <DX^> yeah, I have this template and rewriting all of it in angular sounds like a damn nightmare
[13:04:29] <DX^> yes, robertmaxrees it is
[13:04:31] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:04:43] <jquery118> Okay, moved some stuff around, got it save the name
[13:04:46] <jquery118> shits weird lol
[13:04:46] <robertmaxrees> the handlers only bind to elements that exist at the time of binding.
[13:04:54] <taplar> just different
[13:05:04] <taplar> your going from a library to a framework
[13:05:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:05:34] <DX^> robertmaxrees: hmmm
[13:05:42] <DX^> so if I dymaically add the jquery library after it's loaded
[13:05:46] <DX^> that should work?
[13:05:55] <robertmaxrees> DX^ not necessarily.
[13:06:03] <robertmaxrees> DX^ because content will still get ajaxed in.
[13:06:24] <robertmaxrees> and that kind of rebinding and reloading will effectively negate the ajaxy goodness.
[13:06:39] <robertmaxrees> let's flip this around though: why are you including angular if you're not going to make use of it?
[13:06:49] <DX^> okay here's the deal
[13:07:02] <DX^> I wrote a giant program in angular and I want to combine it in an existing jquery template
[13:07:08] <DX^> which is, of course, a nightmare
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> "jquery template"?
[13:07:25] <z1haze> I am having trouble trying to paginate search results
[13:07:27] <DX^> an ecommerce template that uses jquery
[13:07:47] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/1R90XCQ this is what i have but it breaks
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> heh so as somebody who has a lot of familiarity with that world and with what you're trying to do, my suggestion to you is "don't"
[13:08:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that's not js
[13:08:32] <z1haze> lol my bad wrong channel
[13:08:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:11:03] <DX^> seems like I could use ng-route's controllers to load the scripts dynamically
[13:11:11] <DX^> and then they should bind correctly, no?
[13:11:19] <robertmaxrees> so that's what i was saying before.
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[13:11:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll end up losing out on the benefits of ajaxing content in.
[13:12:01] <DX^> how so?
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> plus you're in for a maintenance nightmare with trying to keep these two platforms working.
[13:12:16] <robertmaxrees> you're reloading and re-running all that js.
[13:12:49] <DX^> maintenance, sloppiness aside
[13:12:52] <DX^> will it work?
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> it may function.
[13:13:02] <taplar> lol
[13:13:06] <robertmaxrees> but it's a really Bad Idea™
[13:13:10] <robertmaxrees> trust me heh
[13:13:19] * taplar wonders if DX^ is a manager
[13:13:30] <DX^> no, I'm a mechanical engineer trying to get shit done
[13:13:32] <robertmaxrees> we just went though some similar stuff and had a consultancy come out to tell us that's a terrible idea.
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> you're going to paint yourself into a really nasty corner.
[13:13:57] <taplar> then you're being short sighted.  robertmaxrees is trying to make you see that
[13:14:30] <DX^> something that works is better and can be fixed is worse than something that does not exist?
[13:14:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:14:48] <robertmaxrees> you're only going to spend more time trying to unwind and fix your mistakes later.
[13:15:04] <robertmaxrees> rewrite stuff that needs it instead of applying the kind of duct tape you're looking at.
[13:15:44] <DX^> rewrite entire libraries that use jquery?
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> rewrite the parts of your site that need it.
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> you can also approach this differently and rewrite one page at a time and then route as necessary from there.
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> but if you currently have a site, dropping in angular and trying to get things to coexist will not go well.
[13:18:12] <DX^> yeah, I see your point
[13:18:29] <DX^> I'll have to have deep thoughts about this
[13:18:37] <DX^> and by that I mean drink heavily and cry a little
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> welcome to programming ;)
[13:19:05] <robertmaxrees> better a 5th now than a handle later.
[13:19:07] <taplar> *puts on his manager hat*
[13:19:27] <DX^> I really hate web coding
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> haha
[13:19:31] <taplar> just take some time to see where you are, where you want to be, and then start figuring out how to break that down in to small pieces and take it on step at a time
[13:19:34] <taplar> *hat comes off*
[13:19:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> that breakdown stuff is key.
[13:20:41] <robertmaxrees> nobody ever said you had to push the whole thing live the moment it's done.
[13:21:16] <DX^> I just worry about scope creep
[13:21:24] <DX^> oh I'm going to implement this ecommerce template
[13:21:24] <taplar> everyone does
[13:21:31] <DX^> becomes oh I'm writing this whole thing in angular now
[13:21:55] <robertmaxrees> "implement thi x" often means "i'm going to replace/rewrite things"
[13:22:00] <robertmaxrees> how else would you do it?
[13:22:23] <DX^> I guess I could hire someone
[13:23:10] <taplar> here's the thing.  i mentioned it earlier.  angular is a framework, jquery is a library.  that means angular is going to have it's own way of doing things that jquery would normally do for you.  It's to your benefit if you are going to start using a framework to learn how that framework approaches solving problems.
[13:26:34] <taplar> and any time you go from something that is pretty free flow do whatever you want to something that usually now a days is based on convention over configuration, there's going to be a learning curve
[13:44:46] <DX^> so I had some deep toilet thoughts
[13:44:58] <DX^> what if I just reinitialize the jquery on ng-route loading
[13:45:01] <DX^> instead of just reloading
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> same problems.
[13:45:28] <robertmaxrees> you're rerunning a bunch of js.
[13:48:02] <MassDebates> !
[13:48:17] <MassDebates> DX^:  If they're that deep, make sure you wipe yourself down with some toilet paper!
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> and still creating a maintenance nightmare.
[13:48:37] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees:  Especially for the plumber. D'ohohoh.
[13:48:44] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:54:20] <hlve> lol
[13:58:26] <MassDebates> Well, I thought  that was some quality humor.
[13:59:26] <MassDebates> Tough crowd.
[13:59:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:01:03] * MassDebates 's top-hat on the floor used to be full of money by now
[14:05:51] <taplar> the group over next to me is singing the states song
[14:05:59] <taplar> i want to punch them in the face
[14:06:03] <taplar> repeatedly
[14:06:05] <robertmaxrees> you should.
[14:06:37] <dni-> whats the states song :D
[14:06:52] <taplar> some jingle that makes remembering all 50 states easier, i guess
[14:07:08] <taplar> cute if your a kid
[14:07:15] <taplar> super annoying if your in a workspace
[14:07:31] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:07:47] <taplar> lets just say the concept of 'professionalism' differs from group to group, ;)
[14:21:48] <hlve> it shouldn't.
[14:21:50] <hlve> :#
[14:22:58] <Utils> I'm trying to create tabs inside of Vue. I'm using some jQuery. I'm unsure on whether or not it's a Vue issue or not so hoping for some assistance.
[14:23:42] <shoky> try it without vue, then try it without jquery
[14:23:43] <shoky> :P
[14:23:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:23:57] <robertmaxrees> should be usinbg vue tbh
[14:25:28] <Utils> Well see, the problem is that with Vue, I'm removing from the state AFTER I select an element... but it selects the wrong element. So I'm really not sure.
[14:25:43] <robertmaxrees> so you're using vue :)
[14:28:18] <Utils> https://jsfiddle.net/dtq5n1a7/14/ line 30 is where it begins. e.currentTarget should be the one clicked and it is so. The closest('li') should be one of it's parents. this.$delete in place on line 44, it deletes the appropriate tab meaning e.currentTarget IS what it should be... but line 30 is always the tab AFTER the one that gets removed. $li is the right tab, if nothing gets removed with this.$delete
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't vue be handling all your bindings and stuff?>
[14:28:50] <Utils> thing is though, even if I'm using Vue, why should somethign that happens after jQuery selectors happen before? Like it's clearly called after... the console.logs happen. It makes no sense.
[14:29:08] <Utils> Vue does yes, and e.currentTarget is the correct target otherwise the removing wouldn't work either.
[14:29:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost then - what does any of this have to do with JQ?>
[14:30:14] <Utils> $(e.currentTarget).closest('li') isn't a parent of e.currentTarget, but a sibling to $(e.currentTarget).parent().parent()
[14:30:25] <Utils> the latter ^ is also a sibling to itself...
[14:31:04] <obert> what's e. in js?
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> obert the event object usually.
[14:31:18] <Utils> It's almost as if Vue's deletion which is called AFTER any jQuery interaction, is executed before any jQuery interaction and then e.currentTarget changes value.
[14:31:36] <robertmaxrees> Utils doesn't vue have a way to like, selectand interact with elements?
[14:31:50] <Utils> No idea. I'm too familiar with jQuery I'm just learning.
[14:32:04] <Utils> I've asked in Vue's gitter too, this was my second place of choice.
[14:32:07] <MassDebates> One can never be 'too' familiar with jQuery.
[14:32:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.  i'd focus on that.  i feel like that's really what you want here tbh.
[14:32:28] <Utils> It may not be a jQuery issue but I have no idea what's going on.
[14:32:28] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, there's a chance these callbacks fire before/after vue does its work.
[14:32:32] <robertmaxrees> lot sof libraries do that.
[14:32:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd look through vues docs and see how it selects elements and stuff.
[14:33:17] <decx> use the inline function argument to pass your data instead of the e.target crap
[14:33:41] <decx> @click="changeTab(tab)"
[14:33:44] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't you favor using the library you're building on though?
[14:34:38] <Utils> i think the idea of Vue is to have no dom interaction inside of components which seems impossible to me. I hwould need to check if Vue has any selectors but that still doesn't really explain why line 44 executes after line 30 despite being in the same function with 0 callbacks
[14:34:50] <Utils> decx: I'll see what that does.
[14:35:04] <robertmaxrees> just explained the possible reason why
[14:35:10] <taplar> heh, my view of vue is react without the virtual dom
[14:35:18] <decx> its got that now
[14:35:25] <taplar> oh sweet
[14:35:26] <decx> virtual dom is just a fancy object
[14:35:34] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:35:34] <taplar> may have to give it another go then
[14:35:58] <taplar> sure, but the whole diff check for applying changes
[14:36:02] <decx> p { propertx1: blah, property2: blubb, children: [{ span: { property1^.......
[14:36:03] <shoky> Utils: if you comment the $delete line you'll see that $li is what you're expecting
[14:36:11] <decx> that's the virtual dom basicly ^^
[14:36:20] <shoky> Utils: the reason is proably that vue reuses the same elements for different items
[14:36:58] <shoky> Utils: so when removing the tab,  the element that $li pointed to is not really removed, just its content is replaced, for performance
[14:37:48] <shoky> (assuming it wasn't the last tab)
[14:37:50] <Utils> shoky: you might be on to something there.
[14:38:13] <shoky> Utils: this is how basically all modern view libraries like vue/react/whatever work
[14:38:33] <MassDebates> The Vue was always my least favorite of TV Shows.
[14:38:37] <Utils> shoky: do you have any suggestions?
[14:38:40] <MassDebates> They always had a skewed View.
[14:38:44] <decx> sheeeeeeeet
[14:38:53] <shoky> Utils: suggestions for what?
[14:39:06] <Utils> shoky: how I'd work around this?
[14:39:11] <shoky> Utils: around what?
[14:39:24] <shoky> what is the problem and what are you trying to do that's not working/
[14:39:35] <shoky> i might've missed it
[14:39:37] <decx> why is tabs an object
[14:40:01] <shoky> because then you can $delete them with the key, probably
[14:40:12] <Utils> ^ yes
[14:40:17] <decx> yeah but when you have a single tab object that you can pass to your function you dont need that
[14:40:45] <shoky> shrugs
[14:41:06] <decx> stuff like keeping track of the tab index is counter to everything this datadriven shit has been created for
[14:41:08] <decx> ^^
[14:42:42] <shoky> yah
[14:43:04] <Utils> decx: no idea what I'd do without lastTabIndex, that basically becomes the key so it's unique every time. I need a tab object so that the view can loop through it and output the appropriate data...?
[14:43:15] <decx> well you make tabs an array
[14:43:21] <decx> then last index is always just tabs.length
[14:45:19] <Utils> shoky: basically, if Tab 1 is active and it gets removed then I want to select Tab 2 (as there is no tab before Tab 1). That's why I have .next() in there but if the content gets replaced as you said then $li / e.currentTarget is now Tab 2... I suppose by that I don't even need .next() as it ialready is the next one.
[14:45:59] <shoky> Utils: my suggestion is first of all what robertmaxrees said.. use vue the way you're supposed to use it
[14:46:37] <shoky> then you don't need .next() or any DOM traversal, most of the time
[14:46:56] <shoky> cause vue already knows where your elements are
[14:46:59] <Utils> decx: then it won't be unique. If I have 3 tab: [1, 2, 3] the length is 3 so when I add a new one the length becomes 4 with a key of 4. If I remove tab 3, I now have keys: [1, 2, 4] with a length of 3. I add another tab and I'll end up with [1, 2, 4, 4] see why I used lastTabIndex? :)
[14:47:05] <Utils> I'll take a look into the Vue way, if one.
[14:47:49] <decx> well calling it tab N isnt very descriptive anyway
[14:48:38] <Utils> decx: it wouldn't be used in the real world. the real world I would have room / pm tabs so it would be: r_roomname or p_username
[14:48:45] <Utils> but just for the example I kept track of the index.
[14:49:13] <decx> https://jsfiddle.net/dtq5n1a7/15/
[14:49:23] <decx> either way, all that delete stuff is overkill
[14:49:46] <decx> and e.target
[14:50:14] <Utils> decx: add 3 tabs, remove the first, add another. You get two tab 2's. Click one of them, both of them load.
[14:50:17] <Utils> ;)
[14:50:35] <decx> this isnt about some obscure bugs but the initial approach
[14:50:49] <shoky> Utils:  let toActive = $li;
[14:50:54] <shoky> that's it..
[14:51:23] <Utils> shoky: yeah as I already said I don't need .next() if it replaces. in fact I wouldn't even need to change the active item at all.
[14:51:57] <shoky> Utils: but decx's is of course the way you're supposed to do it
[14:52:10] <shoky> (i assume)
[14:52:22] <decx> not really
[14:52:41] <decx> just an example for change(arguments)
[14:52:57] <decx> instead of trying e.target or e.currenttarget and reading the dom
[14:54:20] <Utils> shoky: well decx's example as multiple bugs. If you remove a tab, it doesn't always make active a new tab. It wouldw ork if all tab keys were unique but in his example that isn't the case either.
[14:55:06] <decx> it's also 1 line per method, pretty sure you'll be able to stomp out any bugs
[14:55:10] <shoky> Utils: then it can be fixed.. the point is he's not touching the DOM himself, at all
[14:55:14] <Utils> Now, in the case of room and pm windows - they would be unique but well, the idea is that when I receive a message that is towards a cretain room the nI'd loop up that tab via a key and send it off to the component but I realised it's not that simple anyway
[14:56:44] <decx> just know that instead of @change="method" and then using method: function(e) you can use the data object itself and its index in the array with method(thing, index)
[14:57:43] <Utils> oh yeah i just noticed that as you pointed it out. changeTab itself works much better than getting the href.
[15:00:11] <Utils> in the case of rooms though I want to interact with a tab with a key of r_Lobby, idelaly it'd be better to do: this.tabs['r_Lobby'] as opposed to looping through an array, that's why I did keys.
[15:01:14] <Utils> I still think in that aspect, an object is still better but changeTab is an improvement by far.
[15:01:52] <shoky> you usually work with arrays for collections in these view libraries/frameworks.  not objects
[15:02:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:03:45] <Utils> shoky: so you advise a getTab(key) method to involve a loop over the array of tabs?
[15:05:21] <shoky> Utils: if you don't expect tons of tabs, then sure that's fine.  not an explicit loop though..  tabs.find(tab => tab.id === 'r_Lobby')  or with .filter()
[15:06:29] <shoky> Utils: if you have a huge collection that you also want to access by key.. you can have a separate object that maps keys to the items in the collection. but that requires more work on your part
[15:07:06] <Utils> shoky: I'll trust you. I don't expect it to be large but with it being a chatroom you can never be sure. I wouldn't like to impose a limit.
[15:07:20] <shoky> also read through all the vue docs, i'm sure youll find tons of stuff that will help you
[15:07:29] <shoky> (and i say that without havin used vue myself)
[15:09:36] <Utils> Still loads to learn but I'll leave it here as it isn't jQuery related anymore. Thank you shoky for opening my eyes a bit to what Vue (possibly) does with elements.
[15:09:53] <shoky> heh. sure
[15:10:58] <Sayona> Hello :)
[15:11:16] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:21:05] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[15:48:05] <segurb> hello, I have click event, and I am binding this on it, because I want to call inside it other methods from the object, how can I get clicked element if not trough this?
[15:48:36] <taplar> e.target
[15:49:35] <segurb> taplar: well its weird how it doesnt return same element taplar, sometimes it returns the i that is inside div, however this always returns div
[15:51:45] <segurb> taplar: https://0x0.st/9ib.jpg you can see 3 console dirs in editor, they corespond to the output in chrome at the bottom, as you can see if I click on div, its same element, but if I click on i, which is icon, it gives me icon
[15:52:48] <taplar> why wouldn't it?
[15:52:50] <robertmaxrees> screenshots....
[15:53:02] <taplar> 'i click on x, it says it's x'
[15:53:06] <taplar> :|
[15:53:13] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[15:53:16] <segurb> taplar: so why doesnt this give me same output??
[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> this.currentTab isn't a thing
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[15:54:01] <segurb> its delegateTarget
[15:54:03] <segurb> thanks ...
[15:54:15] <robertmaxrees> some quick reading explains everything you need to know.
[15:56:07] <segurb> thanks alot !
[15:56:19] <segurb> so this is acctualy delegateTarget
[15:57:07] <robertmaxrees> "For non-delegated event handlers attached directly to an element, event.delegateTarget will always be equal to event.currentTarget."
[16:12:56] <Aljone> hey guys im trying to send files using ajax
[16:13:06] <Aljone> i was reading this article https://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax , pretty simple
[16:13:19] <Aljone> but my question is , how do i attache another post  data
[16:13:29] <Aljone> like user_id or something and retrieve it
[16:14:16] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/21045034/923919 Aljone
[16:15:22] <Aljone> that was i did BUT
[16:15:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:15:32] <Aljone> i still couldnt find it on the post
[16:15:52] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab and make sure the data is successfully sending.
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> if so, check your server-side.
[16:16:13] <Aljone> my code looks like that data.append("user_id","1);
[16:16:16] <Aljone> my code looks like that data.append("user_id","1"); <
[16:16:25] <Aljone> im using nodejs server side
[16:16:42] <Aljone> i was tring to examine the req that comes there but i couldnt find the user_id
[16:16:42] <robertmaxrees> right, so dump out the entire post object.
[16:16:59] <robertmaxrees> and you're sending all that data?
[16:16:59] <Aljone> the post object is req.body but its empty
[16:17:04] <robertmaxrees> you confirmed via your dev tools?
[16:17:10] <Aljone> i checked i was sending it as a string
[16:17:26] <robertmaxrees> so you checked your network tab?
[16:17:45] <Aljone> ------WebKitFormBoundaryGGqk8pD4C2i06eQQ Content-Disposition: form-data; name="0"; filename="4.txt" Content-Type: text/plain ...........
[16:18:03] <robertmaxrees> those are headers.
[16:18:06] <robertmaxrees> the actual post body.
[16:18:40] <Aljone> hmm
[16:18:42] <Aljone> let me check again
[16:19:48] <Aljone> on the chrom dev tool i see it on request payload
[16:19:59] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you see the data there?
[16:20:57] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming the contents of req.body?
[16:21:12] <Aljone> console.log(req.body) gives me {}
[16:21:30] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) dunno then.
[16:21:57] <robertmaxrees> you positive you're posting everything?
[16:22:00] <Aljone> ill try to save the entire result
[16:22:03] <Aljone> yes i am
[16:22:07] <Aljone> or req <
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> show your JS.
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean from the client-side.
[16:22:48] <Aljone> ill save to file http://paste.ee/p/oEfvN
[16:23:03] <Aljone> from client side i showed u the tutorial
[16:23:06] <Aljone> its just like that
[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> no it's now.
[16:23:11] <robertmaxrees> *not
[16:23:15] <robertmaxrees> you said you changed it :)
[16:24:35] <robertmaxrees> also you've got your middleware setup, yeah?>
[16:24:57] <Aljone> yes but i just added the new data.append("user_id","1") before i send
[16:25:05] <robertmaxrees> show me what you did duder.
[16:25:18] <Aljone> how do i save object into a file to see the entire elements?
[16:25:23] <Aljone> ok
[16:25:23] <Aljone> wait
[16:26:49] <Aljone> http://paste.ee/p/pnWZu
[16:27:34] <robertmaxrees> so what's apiurl set to?
[16:28:12] <robertmaxrees> also: this is firing every change.
[16:28:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not good.
[16:29:12] <Aljone> the apiurl is the right url because i see its responding ...
[16:29:22] <Aljone> why its not good?
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> so you're 100% it's the current url that you're hitting?
[16:29:30] <Aljone> yes i am!
[16:29:31] <Aljone>  :)
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> you want this on submit, no?
[16:29:41] <Aljone> yes i do
[16:29:52] <Aljone> so on change its not good?
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> then set it to run on submit (shrug)
[16:30:11] <Aljone> but i dont have form there and i just want to file to be send when selected
[16:30:16] <Aljone> ok so i need to add a form
[16:30:17] <Aljone> i see
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[16:30:42] <Aljone> but this is creating the formdata no ? new FormData();
[16:30:53] <Aljone> why i cant use it my way?
[16:30:55] <robertmaxrees> back waaaay up.
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> so you'
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> *you're not actually using a form, you're just binding to an input?
[16:31:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:31:33] <Aljone> yes. why its wrong?
[16:31:37] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[16:31:38] <Aljone> input file <
[16:31:44] <Aljone> not just an input
[16:31:45] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't clear about your html.
[16:32:04] <robertmaxrees> it's an input - that's all i needed to know.
[16:32:14] <Aljone> yes input[type=file...
[16:32:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:32:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle real quick.
[16:32:25] <robertmaxrees> it
[16:32:34] <robertmaxrees> *it's fine if the ajax part doesn't work.
[16:32:36] <robertmaxrees> we can fix that later.
[16:32:44] <Aljone> <form id="customer_document_form" action="" method="post"><input type="file" size="10"></form>
[16:32:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, make a fiddle :)
[16:32:52] <Aljone> original html
[16:33:45] <Aljone> of what man
[16:33:50] <Aljone> i showed u all
[16:33:54] <robertmaxrees> your frontend js and html.
[16:33:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:34:00] <robertmaxrees> we can wire up the ajax and see what's getting sent.
[16:34:01] <Aljone> i showed u lol on the pastee
[16:34:03] <robertmaxrees> very easy stuff.
[16:34:09] <robertmaxrees> so then you can copy it over to a fiddle :)
[16:34:10] <Aljone> my server closed by IP
[16:34:17] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about your server yet.
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> wanna confirm your frontend code firs.
[16:34:28] <robertmaxrees> *first
[16:35:06] <Aljone> https://jsfiddle.net/wsejs0n3/
[16:35:33] <robertmaxrees> oh - you missed the adding jquery part..  that's fine.
[16:35:34] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:38:33] <robertmaxrees> alright, so first off
[16:39:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/wsejs0n3/3/
[16:39:21] <robertmaxrees> look at what happens.
[16:40:25] <Aljone> HMM
[16:40:26] <Aljone> empty
[16:40:41] <Aljone> but why
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> so it IS sending that data.
[16:43:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need the correct middleware for this.
[16:44:07] <Aljone> but for me it shows me {}
[16:44:13] <Aljone> like it didnt send the file
[16:44:27] <robertmaxrees> that's why you look at the parameters - that's expected.
[16:44:49] <Aljone> i really didnt understand what you mean
[16:45:04] <Aljone> what should i do exactly?
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> what dev tools are you using?
[16:46:13] <robertmaxrees> either way, to fix the problem you need to tell express how to handle that kind of request.
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> you use middleware for that.
[16:46:26] <Aljone> i do have bodyparser
[16:46:38] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  check out #Node.js for more.
[16:46:46] <Aljone> app.use(bodyParser.text()); // support json encoded bodies
[16:46:55] <robertmaxrees> it's not json encoded iirc.
[16:47:01] <Aljone> yes i have few more
[16:47:12] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, #Node.js should be able to help you.
[16:47:33] <Aljone> but with ur example i didnt see the data sent
[16:47:36] <Aljone> just empty {}
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> you have to look in your network tab.
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> what dev tools are you using?
[16:48:03] <robertmaxrees> chrome?  ff?  edge?
[16:48:53] <cannap> https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable for the guy with file problem
[16:49:33] <robertmaxrees> (the idea was to help him find the right place to ask his question)
[16:49:43] <Aljone> chrome
[16:49:55] <Aljone> lol
[16:49:57] <cannap> yes jquery is the wrong place
[16:50:04] <Aljone> robertmaxrees: ur bad now lol
[16:50:04] <cannap> its just for the front
[16:50:12] <robertmaxrees> i'm bad now?
[16:50:14] <Aljone> yes but the data isnt sending
[16:50:20] <robertmaxrees> yes, it is.
[16:50:22] <Aljone> (the idea was to help him find the right place to ask his question) < lol
[16:50:42] <robertmaxrees> why is that funny?
[16:50:50] <cannap> idk
[16:51:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaah i see whjere the confusion was.
[16:51:48] <robertmaxrees> i thought you'd pasted headers earlier - were you looking at the request payload?
[16:52:23] <Aljone> network
[16:52:24] <Aljone> yes
[16:52:31] <Aljone> so the data sent on the headers?
[16:52:36] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> it's sent in the request body.
[16:52:50] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were referencing the request headers before.
[16:53:42] <cannap> can you shoe me the code?
[16:54:02] <cannap> are you using multipart form or via js FormData or something?
[16:54:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/wsejs0n3/3/
[16:54:14] <robertmaxrees> he's using the based FormData() object.
[16:54:17] <robertmaxrees> *a basic
[16:56:17] <Aljone> but even on ur example the result on browser is {}
[16:56:20] <Aljone> on network
[16:56:31] <cannap> looks not wrong
[16:56:36] <robertmaxrees> because it's the payload that matters.
[16:56:38] <cannap> but oyu know on jsfiddle this will not work
[16:56:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:57:00] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to do what you want it to.  you need to check out the form parsing stuff cannap mentioned.
[16:57:11] <Aljone> hmm ok
[16:57:15] <Aljone> i will look into that
[16:57:41] <cannap> on server you mean robertmaxrees
[16:57:44] <cannap> =??
[16:57:49] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:58:00] <cannap> yea formidable is very good there is also busboy
[16:58:02] <cannap> and something
[16:58:19] <cannap> for handling files but formidable is very simple
[16:58:36] <cannap> handles also file moving
[16:58:51] <cannap> normal a upload puts your files in a tmp folder and you need to move the file
[16:58:53] <cannap> after upload
[17:02:28] <cannap> @Aljone, in the example the show this not in a express app but its almost the same just put the same code in your router controller
[17:02:37] <cannap> it handles out of the box
[17:03:53] <Aljone> cannap, im actually already using busboy
[17:04:27] <cannap> when you can change to formidable
[17:04:35] <cannap> its much simpler and well tested
[17:05:20] <Aljone> formdiable?
[17:05:41] <Aljone> mine looks like that busboy.on('file', function(fieldname, file, filename, encoding, mimetype) {
[17:05:44] <Aljone> but its not working
[17:06:03] <robertmaxrees> #Node.js could pronbably help you figure out why :)
[17:06:39] <Aljone> ok
[17:06:47] <RM982> hi, how do you read a data attribute from a HTML element using JQuery? I was expecting this to work but it doesn't -> var product_price = $('#product option:selected').data('data-price');
[17:06:56] <cannap> so much parameters in formidable you have 2 + error
[17:07:28] <cannap> but yea jquery is the wrong channel for this @Aljone
[17:08:29] <cannap> i see you follow this one https://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:09:00] <RM982> nvm got it I had to pass it without data
[17:09:15] <robertmaxrees> RM982 yep :)
[17:09:21] <RM982> ;)
[17:46:51] <deidyomega> I am trying to figure out how to know when a form is done with the submit: http://pastebin.com/5Z9PKWBC (boiled down code)
[17:47:21] <robertmaxrees> why do you need that info?
[17:47:55] <deidyomega> Because it takes about 10 seconds for the server to compile the PDF, and I just want to create a nice loading gif to let the user know nothing went wrong
[17:50:12] <taplar> have you considered making it restful?
[17:50:31] <deidyomega> In what way?
[17:50:53] <taplar> initial submit hits the endpoint, which returns a header to a url that it can hit to check the status
[17:51:06] <taplar> front end periodically hits that endpoint to see if it is done or if there were errors
[17:51:19] <taplar> once it is done, it will give the url for the resource that you can then use
[17:52:44] <deidyomega> Well that's a pain... I was really hoping there was some kind of on('complete', ...) magic I could use...
[17:52:59] <taplar> it's not a page event
[17:53:40] <deidyomega> The browser knows though... when you click the button, the browser uses a loading icon, then when the download starts, the icon goes away
[17:53:51] <deidyomega> (the loading icon in where the favicon usually goes)
[17:53:53] <taplar> sure
[17:54:39] <deidyomega> So, there is no way of 'seeing' that status?
[17:54:42] <taplar> but you are doing a normal form submit.  so your kinda removing it from javascripts hands
[17:55:28] <deidyomega> Ok, how about doing it from the other way.  Is there anyway to use an AJAX call to the server, and have the response be a PDF that's downloadable?
[17:55:42] <taplar> sure
[17:55:57] <taplar> quick google can tell you more about that
[17:56:54] <deidyomega> I tried the obvious, the only reason I'm using iFrames and target is because the usual suspects didn't work.  When I capture the response, I have a variable that's equal to the PDF's string value, but I don't know how to download it.
[17:58:54] <taplar> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=javascript%2C+download+ajax+response
[18:00:41] <deidyomega> Funny, "When the server page responds to the request, write a response header for the mime type of the file, and it will present a download dialog" - the accepted answer was the first thing I tried, and i couldn't get it to work, I litterally had a pdf string as the response, and I could console.log(result), and it printed the actual pdf string
[18:01:07] <taplar> disregard that one, go to the next one
[18:01:13] <taplar> createObjectURL stuff
[18:03:06] <deidyomega> Will that work for larger files 20 page pdfs?
[18:03:36] <taplar> i don't see why not, provided the request doesn't time out
[18:04:43] <deidyomega> Ok, thanks, I'll try that.  I usually avoid "XMLHttpRequest" because I recall that some browsers handle that differently.  I dont know if that's still the case
[18:04:58] <taplar> you can use $.ajax if you want
[18:05:07] <plamb_> tfw your fiddle works but your code doesnt
[18:05:34] <deidyomega> Ok, I'll see what I can do, thanks for your help
[18:06:38] <plamb_> anyone here familiar with bootstrap
