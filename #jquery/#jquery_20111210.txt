[00:46:59] <Zogot> Ahoy
[00:59:00] <Kilian-> gnarf?
[01:11:44] <rsimoes> Is there a good place on the nets to hire someone to make a theme for jplayer?
[01:12:03] <dr0id> nets?
[01:13:06] <rsimoes> the internets
[01:13:48] <sybarite> join #css
[01:15:32] <rsimoes> I'll ask there; thanks
[01:16:07] <someprimetime> i've got a bunch of anchor tags like <a href="">foo</a>, <a href="">bar</a> they are all separated by commas
[01:16:19] <someprimetime> i'm removing each one of them once it's clicked, but how do i remove the comma as well?
[01:16:31] <someprimetime> i was thinking like $(this).next().text(',').remove();
[01:16:34] <someprimetime> but it doesn't work
[01:16:41] <Guest89738> hi, can somebody help me with css?
[01:17:14] <IvanKuzev> ask in #\css...but we might help you tii
[01:17:22] <IvanKuzev> *too
[01:18:21] <jackiebrown99> http://www.numerologija.org/test/   in Chrome it works good, in IE and firefox not, in firefox the css does not come up or something, i dont see any images
[01:18:51] <rsimoes> What are some well-made alternatives to jplayer?
[01:19:34] <jackiebrown99> i dont know why firefox does not like my site at all
[01:19:36] <jackiebrown99> strange
[01:20:29] <jackiebrown99> in ie the designed is totally whacked
[01:20:41] <IvanKuzev> <html class="no-js" lang="en">
[01:20:51] <IvanKuzev> is the no-js a problem?
[01:21:04] <IvanKuzev> try with clean<html> tag
[01:21:15] <jackiebrown99> how?
[01:22:10] <jackiebrown99> i deleted whoe three lines
[01:22:19] <jackiebrown99> those three lines
[01:22:30] <jackiebrown99> still in firefox the background images dont come up at all
[01:24:33] <IvanKuzev> first thing first... try fixing the 404 errors...i get around 38 in chrome when i try debuging
[01:24:45] <IvanKuzev> ie might crash on one of these and stop displaying everything
[01:25:18] <Spadeski> Hey can anyone make this simple js code a plugin if i send ?
[01:26:02] <jackiebrown99> ivankuzev how you debug?  with right mouse click and inspect element?
[01:26:25] <IvanKuzev> yeah same thing...but i start it with F12
[01:27:48] <jackiebrown99> where can you see the errors?
[01:28:21] <IvanKuzev> look for console
[01:51:43] <sneak> hi guys, this is a stupid syntax question, nothing to do with jq but you guys are smart and will know
[01:51:55] <sneak> how do i specify an attribute on a js object if i have that attribute as string?
[01:52:08] <sneak> i'm trying to loop over the keys of an object and copy them to another object
[01:53:27] <marnik> I'm trying to create a multi-level app using a listview, i want something along these lines: http://bit.ly/rGuaPQ a row with a flip toggle switch next to it, i read about the flip toggle switch (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/switch/), does anyone have a very simple tutorial on that?
[01:53:43] <marnik> it's a webapp to turn things on and off (lights, machines, ...)
[01:54:05] <marnik> so I use the listview to view the different floors, and when you drill down you get to the actual "light switches"
[01:54:18] <marnik> it sounds so easy, but i'm new to jquery, and getting lost in all the docs
[01:54:53] <Theaxiom> if I am in a function in a function and I want to access a method/property of the parent function what would I call? If I call "this" I am only accessing the scope of the current function...
[01:55:01] <marnik> i want a simple on/off switch to do a get on a url, and get the return value (true of false)
[01:55:44] <Theaxiom> marnik, I am assuming it may be pretty simple to accomplish that with regular javascript
[01:56:06] <Theaxiom> marnik, just send an xhhtprequest and if there is a response set a variable to true
[01:56:27] <Theaxiom> xhttprequest*
[01:57:13] <Theaxiom> xmlhttprequest** lol
[01:57:34] <marnik> and what am i looking for in the docs, something like $.get()?
[01:57:49] <marnik> or should i do the low-level xmlhttprequest myself?
[01:57:58] <marnik> that's what I want jquery to hide for me :)
[01:57:59] <Eviltwin> Theaxiom: YOu want to access a "method" or "property" of the parent function?
[01:58:00] <Eviltwin> Why?
[01:58:32] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, I am inside an ajax request inside a controller function
[01:58:39] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[01:58:40] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[01:59:22] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, it is Extjs (Sencha Touch) and it is MVC. I am just trying to wrap my head around scope and there is little to no help in their channel
[01:59:29] <Theaxiom> and it is a fundamental javascript question
[02:00:03] <Theaxiom> marnik, http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[02:00:28] <Theaxiom> marnik, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[02:00:33] <marnik> thanks
[02:01:23] <Theaxiom> marnik, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4282151/how-can-i-ping-a-server-from-javascript
[02:01:56] <Theaxiom> marnik, it looks like someone has a jQuery solution on the stackoverflow link
[02:02:11] <Eviltwin> Theaxiom: While JavaScript makes this possible (in some browsers), it's frowned upon and deprecated
[02:02:22] <Eviltwin> I'd like to see the actual usecase
[02:02:37] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, so I have to call the entire namespace chain where the class is located?
[02:02:58] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, http://pastebin.com/LbanddRY
[02:03:34] <Eviltwin> So you were going to use the caller of the success to get back to your function?
[02:03:44] <Eviltwin> Or what
[02:04:26] <Eviltwin> 'Cause doLogin is not the caller for success
[02:04:29] <Eviltwin> Not even close
[02:04:34] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, I would like to replace line 36 with this: this.account(data);
[02:04:49] <Tenac> Hey, can this url be parsed sing jquery's $.getJSON https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/Qit3ALTelOo?v=2&alt=jsonc
[02:04:55] <cjm> did event.pageX change in 1.7?
[02:04:59] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, but "this" refers to the ajax request
[02:05:10] <Eviltwin> Two things
[02:05:14] <Eviltwin> Do you know what closure means?
[02:05:27] <Falcon> event object is not a part of jquery
[02:05:56] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, no, I come from PHP and am learning this by the seat of my pants
[02:06:16] <Eviltwin> Okay, you see how your failure and success functions are *defined* inside the doLogin function?
[02:06:30] <Eviltwin> The key point being that they are defined there not just called from there or whatever
[02:06:46] <Eviltwin> It means they get access to the parent's scope (and the parent's parent and so on)
[02:07:10] <Eviltwin> In other words, you can reference "options" in the failure or success function
[02:07:25] <Eviltwin> And it will refer to the options that were there when the AJAX started
[02:07:47] <Eviltwin> Additionally, if at line 11 you do var user = this;
[02:08:04] <Eviltwin> Inside your success or failure function, user will reference doLogin's this
[02:08:15] <Eviltwin> Which will be Orderance.controller.Users presumably
[02:08:17] <Theaxiom> ahha
[02:08:42] <Eviltwin> This magical property applies only to functions defined inside other functions
[02:08:59] <Theaxiom> so essentially you have to create a back-door
[02:09:15] <Eviltwin> Not...really...
[02:09:28] <Eviltwin> It's more about remaining sane
[02:09:42] <Eviltwin> Partially about privacy of data
[02:10:00] <Theaxiom> Scope in JavaScript is entirely different than PHP
[02:10:08] <Eviltwin> Actually...
[02:10:52] <Eviltwin> http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php
[02:11:24] <Eviltwin> It's possible to code without them
[02:11:38] <Eviltwin> But at least I always felt some weirdness about it
[02:11:45] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, I forget about those fundamentals in PHP because most of the time I use PHP MVC frameworks
[02:11:54] <Eviltwin> Like I had to either make things too public or sacrifice some functionality
[02:11:56] <Theaxiom> thanks for the refresher
[02:12:05] <marnik> i can't find a tutorial on what I want to do, but it sounds so easy. I want a listview that lists "devices" with an on/off switch. When it's off and i click the switch, there should be an ajax call, and another call for switching off. Any hints?
[02:12:06] <Eviltwin> Theaxiom: That's really a terrible excuse
[02:12:17] <Theaxiom> they make you lazy :P
[02:12:33] <Eviltwin> Theaxiom: Unless you're not actually coding PHP ever, you really need to know the tools available to you in the language
[02:13:01] <Theaxiom> The problem is that everything I know about software development is self-taught through trial and error and long hours
[02:13:07] <Theaxiom> so I never had the complete overview
[02:13:14] <Eviltwin> Books help sometimes
[02:13:26] <Eviltwin> Or online manuals like this one
[02:13:34] <Theaxiom> Yeah I have read quite a few, most of the time I could find what I needed on the internet
[02:14:01] <Eviltwin> Anyway, closures are an important property of many high-level languages
[02:14:08] <Theaxiom> The problem with a lot of manuals is their contextual clues seem completely useless if you have no idea what you are doing
[02:14:22] <jackiebrown99> i get strange display in IE, http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[02:14:27] <jackiebrown99> in firefox and chrome it is ok
[02:14:28] <Theaxiom> thanks for the help, I really appreciate it
[02:14:29] <Eviltwin> And represent the only logical way to encapsulate state + function in some cases
[02:14:40] <Eviltwin> Good lick, I gotta go
[02:14:40] <jackiebrown99> can somebody help me why it is all messed up in ie
[02:14:41] <Theaxiom> I will do a bit more research about scope
[02:14:56] <Eviltwin> Theaxiom: So you're just starting JavaScript?
[02:15:10] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, I have used jQuery off and on, but Extjs is an entirely different beast
[02:15:16] <Theaxiom> and I have never done anything fancy
[02:15:18] <Theaxiom> so I guess you could say yes
[02:15:33] <Eviltwin> Theaxiom: I suggest you poke at this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[02:15:49] <Eviltwin> Covers pretty much everything you ever need to know about JavaScript
[02:15:54] <Eviltwin> Broken down by topic (roughly)
[02:16:00] <Theaxiom> Eviltwin, it is good to know there are actually helpful people left on IRC instead of just trolls
[02:16:15] <Theaxiom> I really appreciate it, I will definitely be reading now :)
[02:17:22] <jackiebrown99> can somebody check this in ie?   http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[02:17:43] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, I will check
[02:18:02] <jackiebrown99> i fixed firefox somehow, but ie i dont have a bloody idea
[02:18:20] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, looks just like it does in chrome...
[02:18:36] <jackiebrown99> the banner is missing and the footer is floating to the right
[02:18:44] <jackiebrown99> in chrome it displays good for me
[02:18:49] <jackiebrown99> i use latest chrome
[02:18:53] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, nope
[02:19:03] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, looks perfect
[02:19:09] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, ie9
[02:19:33] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, I will show you, one sec
[02:19:37] <jackiebrown99> i have ie8
[02:20:43] <cjm> this bit of code was working, and since updating to 1.7 the pageX and pageY are undefined. Could this be related to the update or is it something else?
[02:20:45] <cjm> 			$(document).bind 'touchmove', (event) -> event.preventDefault()
[02:20:45] <cjm> 			$('#other').bind 'touchstart touchmove', (event) ->
[02:20:45] <cjm> 				element = document.elementFromPoint(event.pageX, event.pageY)
[02:20:45] <cjm> 				if element.nodeName is 'LI' then alert 'list item'
[02:20:46] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, http://screencast.com/t/pxvksaP4B7
[02:20:52] <jackiebrown99> in ie8 the banner does not show up and also the footer is floating to the right
[02:21:19] <Eviltwin> cjm: First see ?p
[02:21:29] <Eviltwin> cjm: Second we prefer JavaScript
[02:21:36] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[02:21:40] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ cjm
[02:22:02] <Eviltwin> Useless bot
[02:22:14] <jackiebrown99> thx theaxiom, but in ie 8 i cant get it to work
[02:23:08] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, http://getfirebug.com/lite/ie.html
[02:23:24] <cjm> I'll come back with a demo
[02:23:31] <cjm> in js
[02:24:01] <jackiebrown99> theaxiom is that firebug fir ie?
[02:24:11] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, yeah
[02:25:09] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, figured it might help you
[02:27:26] <jackiebrown99> i am trying to install it on my ie
[02:27:41] <jackiebrown99> there are so many links on firebug site
[02:27:44] <jackiebrown99> i am confused
[02:28:12] <jackiebrown99> is there a plugin for IE?
[02:28:27] <jackiebrown99> i found a link to download the program
[02:28:37] <jackiebrown99> i mean the zip file
[02:28:49] <jackiebrown99> but it should be a plugin not downloadable thing
[02:28:51] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, it's a js file you include in your page
[02:29:04] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, it is javascript based
[02:29:08] <jackiebrown99> oh
[02:29:13] <jackiebrown99> and it will work in ie?
[02:29:27] <jackiebrown99> and then you remove it after you finish debugin?
[02:29:44] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, yep
[02:30:36] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, can come in handy for scenarios such as yours, instead of stabbing in the dark
[02:31:28] <sybarite> has anyone here worked with jquerymobile experiments scrollview
[02:32:14] <marnik> i'm trying to use form element (like a select to get an on/off slider), how do I capture the toggle without waiting for a submit from the form? I don't have a submit, i want the action when the switch is toggled
[02:32:48] <ravenzz> ?change @ marnik
[02:32:48] <bot-t> marnik, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[02:32:59] <marnik> aha, thanks
[02:33:09] <marnik> i tried .tap, .click, nothing worked :)
[02:33:18] <ravenzz> also .fap i guess
[02:33:24] <ravenzz> :p
[02:33:25] <marnik> ;D
[02:33:35] <ravenzz> btw i would use radio buttons
[02:33:39] <ravenzz> for on/off
[02:33:45] <ravenzz> stuffs
[02:33:56] <bjensen> Im trying to debug a jquery plugin. The problem is it does an ajax request with datatype script but the js returned isn't being evaluated as js..any idea what could be messing up since the browser isn't evaluating the incoming js?
[02:34:02] <bjensen> where should I start looking..
[02:34:03] <jackiebrown99> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite.js"></script>
[02:34:05] <jackiebrown99> i added that line
[02:34:15] <jackiebrown99> and it keeps showing me cached version
[02:34:45] <poppiez> hi, I'm looking at the sencha framework. is there any way to build a custom version? I'm only interested in its touch events like pinch, swipe etc.
[02:35:52] <jackiebrown99> ok i am using ie on my local laptop, i can see the firebug javascrript code, but nothing happens in IE
[02:35:56] <jackiebrown99> how you turn it on?
[02:36:00] <jackiebrown99> i hate IE
[02:36:20] <ravenzz> jackiebrown99 It shouldn't, anyway https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite.js?randomnumber
[02:37:46] <Theaxiom> poppiez, try #extjs
[02:38:05] <poppiez> thx
[02:38:33] <ravenzz> jackiebrown99 also IE has its own dev tools, you can access it by pressing F12
[02:38:40] <jackiebrown99> ravenzz what is that code?
[02:38:43] <Theaxiom> ravenzz, he is using ie8
[02:40:40] <ravenzz> Theaxiom np
[02:41:03] <ravenzz> jackiebrown99 which code?
[02:42:18] <jackiebrown99> theaxiom so how to make firebug pop up? I added the code in the head
[02:42:45] <ravenzz> jackiebrown99 use the bookmarklet
[02:42:46] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, isn't there a little bug in the bottom right corner?
[02:43:03] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, that too
[02:47:23] <mahadi> Hi, is there a way to distinguish between the source of a .click()? I call the .click()-method in the js-code and i want to distinguish if the click was done by the user or done via the code?
[02:47:51] <jackiebrown99> i used this link, but it does not work, it shows the top level site, and no there is not bug icon       http://www.firebugger.com/fbg.php?getSite=http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[02:50:22] <jackiebrown99> i tried to add bookmark from here  http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite#Install
[02:50:25] <jackiebrown99> nothing happens
[02:54:31] <Kilian-> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/asynchronous-blocks-of-synchronous-actions < still haven't figured it out. if someone has a spare minute..
[02:56:17] <cjm> Eviltwin: this reproduces the issue http://jsfiddle.net/eHHgP/2/
[02:57:05] <cjm> Eviltwin: change the lib to 1.7.1 and you no longer pick up LIs
[02:57:09] <cjm> i think becasue event coords are undefined
[02:58:11] <bjensen> what could be wrong if my incoming js using ajax isn't being evaluated? datatype is set to script
[03:01:20] <jackiebrown99> is there something wrong with this css link? my dreamweaver gives me error   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css.css" media="all" />
[03:03:54] <cjm> Anyone know why this stops working with 1.7.1? http://jsfiddle.net/eHHgP/2/
[03:04:36] <RLa> jackiebrown99, what doctype are you using?
[03:06:46] <jackiebrown99> html
[03:07:03] <jackiebrown99> <!doctype html>
[03:07:12] <jackiebrown99> can you debug in IE8 Rla
[03:08:11] <qawsedrf> i am having this issue, http://i.imgur.com/uCYtD.png , any idea whats wrong ? it only happens when i click a link on the same domain from the webpage and then click browser back button.
[03:08:23] <RLa> hm, html5 should allow both > and />
[03:08:46] <RLa> jackiebrown99, i cannot, i have no fucking ie installed on debian
[03:09:12] <RLa> jackiebrown99, does it have error details or explanation?
[03:09:12] <jackiebrown99> why IE does not have a firebug, what is wrong with Microsoft?
[03:09:23] <jackiebrown99> i get many errors in dreamweaver
[03:09:25] <jackiebrown99> over 100
[03:09:30] <RLa> huh
[03:09:44] <jackiebrown99> so I am deleting all those errors, is dreamweaver overreacting?
[03:10:07] <RLa> you should remove as much code as possible till you get it error-free
[03:11:25] <RLa> qawsedrf, i see nothing wrong there
[03:13:05] <jackiebrown99> if somebody gets time and can debug in ie8 please do so, the content is floating to the right and banner is missing in ie8  http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[03:19:59] <ThiefMaster> jackiebrown99, IE8+ does have debug tools - pretty crappy ones though compared to any other browser
[03:28:45] <igore> Hello, I have a problem with nested accordions, height is not calculated properly and lots of extra space is added bellow the child accordion..
[03:28:58] <igore> Exactly as if all the accordion items are open..
[03:29:10] <igore> I guess the size gets calculated before the accordion is collapsed..
[03:29:14] <igore> Anyone?
[03:30:38] <mukamike> oh accordions, im fighting with them right now too :D
[03:31:22] <igore> :(
[03:31:35] <igore> have you thought of a good alternative yet?
[03:31:42] <igore> mukamike?
[03:33:30] <Spadeski> Hey how do I get all elements without the selected class in a <ul>
[03:39:22] <rsimoes> Is there some tool to shift the color theme of arbitrary HTML and CSS?
[03:39:43] <bjensen> can I check using firebug the datatype that is set when using $.ajax?
[03:40:08] <rsimoes> i.e., automatically establish relationship between provided extracted from the markup and stylesheet, and then allow me to adjust via gui
[03:40:22] <rsimoes> between colors* extracted...
[03:43:32] <fotoflo> hmm, my sortable() just killed my droppable()
[03:45:31] <mukamike> yeah igore
[03:45:35] <mukamike> after lots of hours
[03:45:37] <mukamike> im almost done
[03:45:38] <mukamike> :D
[03:45:43] <mukamike> just one last fix
[03:46:00] <mukamike> (im a n00b) :D
[03:47:46] <jackiebrown99> is this coding new?  <nav>.....</nav>   befire you have to use id or class
[03:48:01] <jackiebrown99> now you can just make names up?
[03:49:03] <sean`> jackiebrown99, they're part of HTML5
[03:49:14] <sean`> To make web pages more efficient and readable
[03:51:29] <jackiebrown99> so you dont have to use id and and class anymore?
[03:51:36] <jackiebrown99> are older browsers supporting this?
[03:51:55] <perverse> those tags arn't made up, <nav> is actually a tag in html5
[03:52:19] <perverse> guess where it's supposed to go
[03:52:34] <jackiebrown99> oh, maybe ie8 is messed up because of this?
[03:52:36] <jackiebrown99> possible?
[03:52:52] <jackiebrown99> and <header> is tag too?
[03:53:14] <jackiebrown99> <header class="wrapper">
[03:53:17] <perverse> <header> <content> <article>
[03:53:17] <jackiebrown99> this is strange to me
[03:53:20] <perverse> there are a few
[03:53:30] <jackiebrown99> but does IE 8 support this?
[03:53:37] <mukamike> i need some help on fixing some behaviour problems on an accordion, anyone might be willing to give me a hand on this? sorry to interrupt!
[03:53:38] <perverse> i have no idea, ask google
[03:53:43] <perverse> :)
[03:54:16] <mukamike> http://mr.vicetto.com
[03:54:33] <mukamike> it doesnt quite work propertly i dunno how i can fix this
[03:55:11] <perverse> in what way is it not working, mukamike?
[03:56:21] <Spadeski> Hey can someone help me work with list /
[03:56:29] <jackiebrown99> is this correct?   #header #navigation ul li {
[03:56:46] <jackiebrown99> or do i have to use div instead of id
[03:57:25] <mukamike> well its hard to explain, let me try.you click selected works - scroll down the content - then click paintins - ' see here is the problem ' the heading is not visible
[03:57:28] <mukamike> perverse:
[03:57:45] <frenocha> anyone know of a way to suppress the soft keyboard in android browsers, obviously preferably through jquery?
[03:58:31] <perverse> it seems to be working fine for me, mukamike
[03:58:44] <perverse> it's as i would expect an accordion to act, anyway
[03:59:10] <perverse> could probably remove some of those line breaks, im at 1080p and still can't fit the accordion on my screen, lol
[03:59:32] <mukamike> did you update? i put images now
[03:59:34] <mukamike> hehe
[04:00:16] <mukamike> those breaks where to check huge content behaviour
[04:01:16] <perverse> mmm yeah
[04:01:18] <perverse> once again, the content is huge
[04:01:28] <perverse> but the accordion is doing what i would expect it to do, i cant see anything odd happening
[04:01:41] <perverse> just massive amounts of content making it really large
[04:01:59] <mukamike> yeah
[04:02:11] <mukamike> ok man
[04:02:14] <perverse> like
[04:02:17] <perverse> if you want the panels smaller
[04:02:24] <mukamike> nono
[04:02:31] <perverse> try just css styling your hidden panels to have a static height and overflow-y: scroll
[04:02:34] <mukamike> i want to fix a little little something only
[04:02:43] <mukamike> but its fine people dont really notice
[04:02:45] <mukamike> :)
[04:02:54] <perverse> hmm, yeah, i'm really struggling to see the problem :) lol
[04:03:00] <mukamike> :p
[04:03:11] <mukamike> thanks man
[04:03:14] <perverse> np
[04:03:16] <mukamike> i keep working
[04:03:39] <igore> mukamike> Don't we all...
[04:04:44] <Spadeski> Hey can someone help me make this so it finds the selected li and hides the rest http://pastebin.com/44h0hgMz
[04:06:27] <igore> jQuery(viewSelector).show().siblings().hide();
[04:06:34] <igore> Spadeski-> something like that....
[04:06:44] <Spadeski> ummm
[04:06:47] <Spadeski> alright
[04:08:20] <qawsedrf> i am having this issue, http://i.imgur.com/uCYtD.png , any idea whats wrong ? it only happens when i click a link on the same domain from the webpage and then click browser back button.
[04:08:41] <qawsedrf> the issue does not occurs in FF tho, only chrome. is chrome 15.x buggy ? :/
[04:14:39] <Theaxiom> is this valid in JavaScript: Orderace.config.ServerUrl += '/' += data.token;
[04:14:49] <Theaxiom> Can you += twice in one line?
[04:15:40] <Spadeski> igore nah couldnt get that too work with this particular example
[04:15:45] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: yes you can
[04:16:00] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], getting a syntax error in my IDE :/
[04:16:00] <Cork[home]> v1 += v2+= 10
[04:16:10] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], thanks
[04:16:12] <Cork[home]> ?eval "your here"
[04:16:14] <bot-t> Cork[home]: "your here"
[04:16:17] <Cork[home]> yay
[04:16:31] <Spadeski> ?eval "your not here"
[04:16:32] <bot-t> Spadeski: "your not here"
[04:16:34] <Spadeski> lol
[04:16:56] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[04:17:01] <Cork[home]> ?eval var v1 = 5, v2 = 10; v1 += v2 += 20; print(v1); print(v2)
[04:17:02] <bot-t> Cork[home]: 3530
[04:17:06] <Cork[home]> opps
[04:17:18] <Cork[home]> ?eval var v1 = 5, v2 = 10; v1 += v2 += 20; print(v1);print("  "); print(v2)
[04:17:19] <bot-t> Cork[home]: 35" "30
[04:17:25] <Cork[home]> so it works
[04:17:35] <IgnisDiabolus> ?eval document.write('hello world');
[04:17:35] <bot-t> IgnisDiabolus: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[04:17:39] <IgnisDiabolus> hihihi
[04:17:40] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], weird
[04:17:50] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: what browser?
[04:18:03] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], Chromium and my IDE (Aptana)
[04:18:23] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: don't count on aptana to show you if js is valid or not
[04:18:25] <werner_> Hi
[04:18:25] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], I will just do it the long way, no big deal
[04:18:32] <Cork[home]> its quite a bit behind and wrong
[04:18:48] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], yeah well it doesn't work in Chromium either, so meh
[04:18:56] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], it might have something to do with the . context
[04:19:35] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: works fine in chromium here
[04:20:01] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], :'(
[04:20:05] <Theaxiom> weird
[04:20:21] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: but the variables has to exist or you will try to add undefined
[04:20:41] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], I am working with Extjs so I am in a controller, everything is namespaced, that could be the issue
[04:20:48] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], something to do with the scope
[04:21:07] <Cork[home]> += is basic js, so it has nothing to do with extjs
[04:21:19] <Cork[home]> the variables might not exist in the scope though
[04:22:05] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], that's what I meant, the variable exists, but it may not be seeing it in that context for some reason. The old fashioned way is working: Orderace.config.ServerUrl = Orderace.config.ServerUrl + '/' + data.User.token;
[04:22:47] <Cork[home]> then Orderace.config.ServerUrl += '/' + data.User.token; should work too
[04:22:54] <Cork[home]> theres no reason why it wouldn't
[04:23:26] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], oh I did += twice, let me try your way
[04:23:47] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: what did you try to assign to the second time?
[04:24:17] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], I was doing this: Orderace.config.ServerUrl += '/' += data.User.token;
[04:24:33] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], Orderace.config.ServerUrl += '/' + data.User.token; is working, thanks :)
[04:24:33] <Cork[home]> '/' isn't a variable so you can't assign to it
[04:24:57] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], oh I see what it's doing if I do that
[04:24:58] <Spadeski> http://jsfiddle.net/KZZHu/ I want it too get the current li and and remove the rest
[04:25:03] <Cork[home]> '/' += data.User.token is the same as '/' = '/' + data.User.token
[04:25:20] <Theaxiom> I understand that now, thanks
[04:25:57] <Theaxiom> Cork[home], I come from PHP so it is these little things that get me, haha
[04:26:14] <Theaxiom> different syntax, yet surprisingly familiar
[04:27:01] <Cork[home]> Theaxiom: you can't do 'something' .= 'something else' either
[04:27:02] <Cork[home]> :)
[04:27:06] <werner_> http://jsfiddle.net/fPagM/3/ i want to append images into a div by a loop. But the relative positions didnt work. Does anyone why`?
[04:27:19] <Spadeski> idk why but I cannot grasp this logic http://jsfiddle.net/KZZHu/
[04:27:57] <Theaxiom> *facepalm*
[04:28:32] <jackiebrown99> ohhh ifixed my IE8, apparently it could not digest html5 tags like <footer> <section> <header> and i used ids and divs instead
[04:28:54] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, :)
[04:29:08] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, yeah those are HTML5 spec
[04:29:22] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, it was regurgitating, haha
[04:30:05] <jackiebrown99> IE8 just throw up those html5 tags
[04:30:10] <jackiebrown99> mess all over the room
[04:30:41] <jackiebrown99> there is one problem i have still how to center the top menu because there is no container, i tried text align center on a but does not work
[04:30:42] <jackiebrown99> http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[04:31:13] <jackiebrown99> apparently there were something missing in the cide, otherwise html5 tags are digested by IE8 normally
[04:31:23] <jackiebrown99> but I changed them to good all divs and ids
[04:33:23] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, margin:auto
[04:33:42] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, that is, if you have defined a fixed-width
[04:36:14] <jackiebrown99> i tried margin auto
[04:36:19] <jackiebrown99> did not do the trick
[04:36:25] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, is it a div?
[04:36:41] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, if you set it to a fixed width it should center if you set margin:auto
[04:36:58] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, or do you mean the content inside the div?
[04:37:51] <emx> is there a difference? $( '#menu' ).find( '.item' ) and $( '#menu .item' )?
[04:38:34] <werner_> What is the error here? $('<img/>', {'src': $source, 'style': 'position: absolute; top:'+$x'+px; left:'+$y+'px;'}).appendTo('#map');
[04:38:52] <werner_> Why i cant insert the top and left propertys relative?
[04:39:30] <werner_> if i type fixed values instead of $x and $y it works :/
[04:39:39] <emx> werner_, you prepend your variable names with a $-sign?
[04:40:18] <jackiebrown99> theaxiom link is here
[04:40:19] <jackiebrown99> http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[04:40:20] <werner_> emx, oh my god. you are right. *switch from php to js*
[04:40:24] <jackiebrown99> it is id
[04:40:27] <emx> one way or another: your syntax seems to be messed up
[04:40:59] <emx> top:'+$x'+px
[04:41:11] <emx> i guess this should be ..top: '+x+'px
[04:41:44] <werner_> emx, yes. You are right again. It works now :) Thanks a  lot!
[04:41:52] <emx> welcome
[04:43:56] <Theaxiom> jackiebrown99, http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2004/02/css_crib_sheet_3_centering_a_div/
[04:45:50] <AlexC_> G'morning
[04:47:07] <AlexC_> I'm binding to the 'change' event of ':input' elements, and I am using a label with these radio/checkbox inputs - however, in IE8 the event never gets fired if these radio/checkbox inputs have 'display:none'. How can I resolve this?
[04:49:07] <AlexC_> A ha http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8508
[04:58:27] <igore> How to I prevent the default focusing of the first form field???
[04:58:42] <igore> adding tabindex="-1" to all input element doesn't work
[04:58:43] <walid> hi lads! i'm trying to use isotope plugin, and it's working fine, except for one thing
[04:58:49] <igore> Any ideas?
[04:59:16] <walid> i have this fiddle set up, that works good, but when i try to apply it to my site, it doesn't work
[04:59:19] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/LbEuk/
[04:59:41] <walid> precisely, what doesn't work is this line: getSortData: {             type: function($elem) {                 console.log($elem.data('type'));                 return $elem.data('type');             },
[05:00:23] <walid> and my site is this: http://moijconnais.com/
[05:00:48] <walid> basically, when you click on an album, it should filter by class, and sort by 'data-type'
[05:01:06] <walid> i printed the result of getSortedData, and i have undefined
[05:06:09] <walid> hehe difficult saturday for fellow jqueryers?
[05:11:15] <igore> yeah, i'd try and be more helpful if it wasn't 5:11am
[05:11:38] <igore> The only reason I'm not sleeping is because I'm fighting with jQuery also and noone is around to lend a hand..
[05:12:42] <walid_> igore: what's ur issue again?
[05:12:49] <IvanKuzev> i might lend a hand...or something..but dont want to talk in chanel much
[05:13:01] <walid_> IvanKuzev: you acting shy?
[05:13:04] <walid_> ;)
[05:13:24] <igore> I want to blur all input fields..
[05:13:26] <IvanKuzev> no ..its just hard to keep track
[05:13:33] <walid_> IvanKuzev: true that
[05:13:34] <igore> first one is focused by default..
[05:13:51] <igore> How do you start a private message?
[05:14:14] <walid_>  / msg igore asd
[05:14:37] <IvanKuzev> this way /msg meself hello!
[05:16:08] <walid_> so... anyone used isotope b4?
[05:16:26] <IvanKuzev> $('input').blur() not working?
[05:27:40] <ndss56> anyone know how to capture the keyboard key "Enter"?
[05:28:00] <crab> check for keycode 13.
[05:29:33] <ndss56> crab: how?
[05:31:38] <crab> capture a keypress event, check e.which == 13
[05:32:11] <ndss56> if ($this == 13')?
[05:33:09] <crab> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/302122/jquery-event-keypress-which-key-was-pressed maybe.
[05:33:20] <ndss56> crab: thanks
[05:50:30] <luke--> hi
[05:51:10] <luke--> is there a way to call a function with a given delay AND to stop the delay i.e. stop the function from being executed when I want it?
[05:53:27] <walid> check stop()?
[05:53:29] <walid> stop()?
[05:53:31] <walid> stop?
[05:53:34] <walid> delay?
[05:53:59] <walid> so, bot not answering. check delay() and stop()
[05:56:06] <Zogot> ? stop() @ luke--
[05:56:06] <bot-t> luke--, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[05:56:37] <luke--> Zogot: thanks!
[05:56:48] <luke--> couldn't find that oO
[05:58:15] <vmassuchetto> What's the best "url" param to do a $.post request on the same page?
[06:04:56] <xwurf_> hi, i have the following jquery syntax: 	alert($(this).next().attr('name') ); does not work; it says "undefinded" but  $(this).attr('name') works fine and gives the name
[06:05:02] <xwurf_> but there is definitely a silbling
[06:05:20] <dr0id> heh
[06:05:24] <dr0id> gj
[06:08:41] <IvanKuzev> are you sure its a next?
[06:09:19] <IvanKuzev> or if the next has the attribute name
[06:09:27] <xwurf_> no its a real next object
[06:09:28] <fanthomas> xwurf_: what does firebug console says to $(this).next()  ?
[06:09:59] <fanthomas> xwurf_: ups.. I mead $( whatever id )...
[06:10:02] <fanthomas> i mena
[06:10:12] <fanthomas> mean... whats wrong with my keyboard :-)
[06:10:46] <xwurf_> @fanthomas: yeah its an object
[06:11:18] <xwurf_> the hml code: <input name="MyObject[one]" type="text" maxlength="255" /> resp.  <input name="MyObject[two]" type="text" maxlength="255" />
[06:11:50] <xwurf_> with $(this) i get MyObject[one]
[06:15:11] <xwurf_> does something like $("#myinstance").next() work in generelly?
[06:16:00] <dabear> xwurf_: sure, why not
[06:16:24] <xwurf_> ok, thought because with # i select one concrete instance so next() will not work
[06:17:58] <dabear> xwurf_: see ?next
[06:17:59] <bot-t> xwurf_, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[06:18:16] <dabear> it doesn't carehow the previous object was selected
[06:18:28] <IvanKuzev> yeah and i think it couns the texts as an elements too
[06:18:37] <dabear> but .next() only returns the next sibling
[06:18:40] <xwurf_> ok thx
[06:19:02] <dabear> IvanKuzev: jquery does not count text elements
[06:19:18] <dabear> unless you force it, with .contents() or similar
[06:20:40] <xwurf_> The problem where i get this "undefined" messages arise in jquery.yiigridview.js
[06:20:44] <xwurf_> when i try:
[06:20:52] <xwurf_> alert($(inputSelector).next().attr('name') );
[06:21:36] <xwurf_> after line 43 :)
[06:21:38] <dabear> xwurf_: then that element does not have a name attribute, or there are no immediately following input element
[06:21:58] <dabear> that could happen, if you for example have tihs structure:
[06:22:03] <fanthomas> xwurf_: can you put it to jsfiddle.net?
[06:22:24] <dabear> <div><input id="myinstance"></div><div><input...></div>
[06:22:41] <xwurf_> @dabear... ahhh. next() selects then the div?
[06:22:41] <rails_noob> morning
[06:22:43] <dabear> if you now do .next() on myinstance, there will be no more sibling
[06:22:52] <xwurf_> ah ok
[06:22:55] <dabear> xwurf_: it would select zero element
[06:23:08] <xwurf_> but what about this structure:
[06:23:14] <dabear> and if you do .attr now you wouold get undefined
[06:23:52] <xwurf_> <td><input .....></td><td><input .....></td>.... ?
[06:23:58] <xwurf_> same effect, i guess?
[06:24:05] <IvanKuzev> yep
[06:24:15] <dabear> xwurf_: yes
[06:24:20] <xwurf_> ok thx
[06:24:46] <dabear> the point is, the second attribute IS NOT a sibling of the first
[06:24:51] <dabear> hm
[06:24:56] <dabear> second input*
[06:25:48] <IvanKuzev> you can use $(input selector).parent().next().children('input:eq(0)')
[06:25:51] <dabear> .closest("tr").next().find("input").first() will get you what you want
[06:25:59] <fanthomas> $(self).siblings("input")[0].name
[06:27:01] <dabear> fanthomas: no
[06:27:50] <dabear> it is neither a sibling, nor is using siblings() correct for finding the next sibling
[06:28:04] <xwurf_> $(inputSelector).parent().next().children('input:eq(0)') works, thx :)
[06:28:22] <rails_noob> does jquery have any tools for detecting the cursor point in textareas?
[06:28:31] <dabear> rails_noob: no
[06:28:40] <rails_noob> dabear: :(
[06:28:42] <rails_noob> ty
[06:28:45] <dabear> rails_noob: there are multiple plugins, do a google search
[06:28:59] <dabear> im too lazy to do it for you
[06:29:00] <dabear> :)
[06:29:09] <rails_noob> i dont' want to use a plugin, i'll just write a small function
[06:29:25] <dabear> that's up to you
[06:29:27] <rails_noob> gotta keep doze http request low namean
[06:34:02] <Dreamstar> Hi there!

[06:56:35] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find the parent domain name from iframe?
[07:01:46] <xwurf_> hi, is there a chance to handle both, keypresses and moucse clicks via one function?
[07:02:10] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to find the parent domain name from iframe?
[07:03:11] <IvanKuzev> SoulRaven : well you can aways do all the sring operations
[07:04:57] <SoulRaven> IvanKuzev: ??
[07:05:35] <IvanKuzev> like $('iframe').attr('src').split("/")[2]...thats your domain name
[07:05:44] <IvanKuzev> with the subdomain in it
[07:07:35] <SoulRaven> IvanKuzev: this is to find out the iframe url, but i want in reverse, to find out the parent domain name or ip, from iframe
[07:12:55] <Zogot> Ahoy all
[07:13:31] <shesek> SoulRaven, if a different website is embedding an iframe from your site, you can't tell the domain
[07:13:35] <shesek> you don't have access to it
[07:15:33] <SoulRaven> i know that, i also try with the setting of a variabile in parrent site like top.ceva and call the variabile from iframe like top.ceva but is not working
[07:20:00] <xwurf_> hi, is there a chance for the following scenario (realizing with jquery, without session objects): cgridview, 3 input fields, i enter something in field 1 and then click with my mouse to field 3; filtering is done for field 1 but focus is set to field 3
[07:20:05] <shesek> SoulRaven, you can't access anything from the embedding page if its on a different protocol/domain/port
[07:20:16] <shesek> the same-domain origin policy prevents you from doing that
[07:20:44] <shesek> SoulRaven, what are you trying to do, exactly?
[07:21:32] <SoulRaven> shesek: for short, to find out the domain name or ip of that domanin from where the iframe is loaded
[07:21:57] <xwurf_> concretely what i need: before cgridview.update is done, i need the latest focus
[07:22:04] <jackiebrown99> is there a way to decrease the size of a pic with css?
[07:22:09] <shesek> SoulRaven, you can look at the referrer
[07:22:11] <jackiebrown99> you can do that with html
[07:22:18] <shesek> jackiebrown99, no
[07:22:26] <shesek> jackiebrown99, oh, wait
[07:22:36] <shesek> jackiebrown99, you mean the width/height or the file size ?
[07:22:41] <jackie99> yes
[07:22:59] <jackie99> if you use width in css it does not make the image smaller, it just cuts it off
[07:22:59] <shesek> jackie99, yes... what? I gave two options
[07:23:03] <SoulRaven> shesek: i have try with the referer, but if the parent site is loaded from the outside sources, like email boxes, then the refferer is the email url, not the main site
[07:23:13] <SoulRaven> so is not working with referrer
[07:23:25] <jackie99> so how to do it shesek
[07:23:39] <shesek> SoulRaven, no, the referrer should be the page embedding you, regardless of where the user came to the embedding page from
[07:24:04] <shesek> jackie99, it does work with width/height, assuming you're using it on the <img> element and not on its container or something
[07:24:18] <shesek> jackie99, if it doesn't work, reproduce on jsfiddle.net and paste a link here
[07:24:24] <SoulRaven> is not, i have find out this today, is the main site is loaded from outside sourcees, the referrer is the outside source not the main site
[07:24:32] <jackie99> shesek, how can you use it on image in css?
[07:24:46] <shesek> jackie99, just like you would do it on any other element?
[07:24:54] <jackie99> background: url("images/facebook.png") no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
[07:24:57] <jackie99> i have this
[07:25:20] <jackie99> oh you need  img {   width:100px;}
[07:25:25] <shesek> oh, resize a **background**, not an <img> ?
[07:25:42] <jackie99> no, i need to make image smaller
[07:25:51] <jackie99> like 60 px, now it is 65 px
[07:26:12] <jackie99> #banner .banner-footer ul#banner-icons img {}
[07:26:15] <jackie99> will this work
[07:26:18] <IvanKuzev> background-size:60px 60px
[07:26:28] <IvanKuzev> but that has problems with old browsers
[07:26:36] <jackie99> uhh
[07:26:48] <jackie99> so what is the fix then
[07:26:58] <jackie99> maybe some users still use IE 2 or soemthing, who knows
[07:26:58] <shesek> jackie99, is the image used as a background for another element, or as a regular <img> element?
[07:26:58] <IvanKuzev> use an img tag
[07:27:16] <jackie99> http://www.numerologija.org/test/
[07:27:29] <jackie99> here is the link, you see three social bookmark images there?
[07:27:34] <jackie99> below my pictures
[07:28:00] <jackie99> social bookmark circle icons
[07:28:03] <jackie99> they are cut off
[07:28:07] <jackie99> i want to make them smaller
[07:28:58] <jackie99> ok , i will make more space for them
[07:28:59] <IvanKuzev> ok...here is solution for you
[07:29:09] <SoulRaven> the ifame has acces to any outside object, like parent, top, document ?
[07:29:17] <IvanKuzev> make the images as img elements and wrap tha A around tham\
[07:29:32] <IvanKuzev> than put them in the li
[07:29:32] <jackie99> do you mean in html?
[07:29:55] <IvanKuzev> yes....do you want the whole code?
[07:30:29] <jackie99> yes it would be better that way, and I know how to resize them in html, now I dont even know hwo to link these icons, is it possible?
[07:30:35] <jackie99> i made a link, but it does not work
[07:30:41] <jackie99> i need to link them to my facebook
[07:30:48] <jackie99> twitter, and youtube
[07:31:06] <IvanKuzev> you put the link wrong
[07:31:16] <IvanKuzev> here is how you must put it
[07:31:28] <jackie99> i use it like this  <li class="first"><a href="#">Facebook</a></li>
[07:31:54] <IvanKuzev> <a href='http://facebook.com'><img src='location/to/image.gif'></a>
[07:32:21] <jackie99> yes, otherwise it will not work i guess
[07:32:39] <IvanKuzev> and remove that background on the li elements
[07:32:47] <IvanKuzev> you wont need it
[07:33:13] <jackie99> thank you it works
[07:33:25] <jackie99> do you know why the png has suck a big file size
[07:33:34] <jackie99> if i use jpeg the size is much smaller
[07:33:56] <shesek> SoulRaven, no, none of them
[07:34:08] <shesek> SoulRaven, unless is the same protocol/host/port
[07:34:50] <jackie99> great support on this chat
[07:34:59] <jackie99> really appreciate it
[07:35:19] <IvanKuzev> you might get a better file size if you switch to paletted for the pngs
[07:35:31] <IvanKuzev> but it wont beat the jpeg compresion
[07:35:42] <koopa58> Why does this not work: .find('div').hasClass('item4') but this does: .find('div.item4') ?
[07:36:13] <IvanKuzev> this .find('div').hasClass('item4') is a boolean test
[07:36:21] <IvanKuzev> it returns true or false
[07:36:39] <IvanKuzev> .find('div.item4') this returns jquery object
[07:36:47] <koopa58> IvanKuzev: ahhh allright.. is there a way to return a jquery object in that fashion?
[07:37:35] <IvanKuzev> i think filter()
[07:37:52] <IvanKuzev> does that.
[07:38:28] <koopa58> IvanKuzev: thanks, I'll check it out =)
[07:42:01] <anli__> Is there a timepicker in which I can drag hands?
[07:42:19] <anli__> I am not sure how to do that techically, maybe html5
[07:43:54] <IvanKuzev> well the rotation isnt exactly easy to make
[07:44:23] <jackie99> how can you add shadow to image? will it work in all browsers?
[07:44:47] <anli__> Maybe rotation is something that few browsers will support
[07:45:17] <anli__> Or wait a second, isnt jquery covering for all browsers when it comes to rotation?
[07:45:46] <IvanKuzev> jackie99: you dont...you actually add a layer under the image for the popups
[07:48:26] <IvanKuzev> jackie99:its not too complicated but i dont know..you better look for a plugin to do that.
[07:55:35] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. In terms of promises/deferred's, is there a degree of asynchronicity that determines whether it's a good idea to use them? In other words, if you have 5 different "parse" functions of different complexity, would it be a good idea to have those functions return promises?
[07:58:47] <xwurf_> a stupid quesiton: is it possible to capture a mouse-click over keypress-event?
[08:11:20] <luke--> can you bind the "this" reference to a specific object in jQuery?
[08:11:32] <luke--> i mean bind it in a function

[08:17:17] <luke--> Thanks dabear and Whirl3d !
[08:17:38] <Grinchy> cheers :)
[08:18:54] <Whirl3d> dabear, can you explain the basic concept of gathering form data for submitting a form using ajax (without the plugin). I have element names setup like <input name='contact["name"]["first"]'/> so that the associative array is already setup in php when I POST the data.
[08:19:36] <dabear> Whirl3d: .serialize() the form and send it as the data parameter?
[08:19:39] <dabear> to .ajax
[08:20:14] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I have been reading about serialize, but I guess I just don't get how it works with associate array names for name parameters on input elements.
[08:20:49] <Whirl3d> I guess I will tias, but I was hoping someone had some nitty gritty for me? Any advice?
[08:21:12] <baldaris> hey guys , i am a php developer ,kindda new to jquery..I have a dynamically generated page with navigation and each navigation menu has certain forms , numbero of menus in navigation and number of forms are determinedusing a loop , I need to hide all the remaining forms , and only show forms relavent to menu which user clicks on..kindda like tabed menu...can someone point me in the right
[08:21:12] <baldaris> direction??
[08:22:06] <Whirl3d> baldaris, have you looked into jqueryUI tabbed interface?
[08:22:07] <dabear> Whirl3d: the docs should help you there, plenty of examples
[08:22:45] <Whirl3d> Yeah, thanks dabear. I've been reading and reading...I'm sure it will sink in any minute now. I apprecciate your help
[08:22:58] <Whirl3d> *appreciate.
[08:23:50] <dabear> Whirl3d: you couldn't have done *that* much reading, it's just two relevant pages; that is .serialize and .ajax
[08:25:00] <baldaris> Whirl3d:yeah it helped me a lot.problem is in the example the ids , which is using for selecting is for pages whose content could be changed..since my page is dynamically generated , i was dynamically naming ids as well..is that the right approach...as i need to distinguish between various menu tabs
[08:28:05] <Whirl3d> sure. Use classes to determine "tabs" and then filter by classes. In other words, each nav menu, apply a unique classname. Then assign the same class to all elements you want on that tab.
[08:28:58] <Whirl3d> Then you can select all the elements for a navigation tab easily by $("."+$("#navtabid").attr("class"));   or something similar
[08:29:50] <Neil> Can I use jQuery to observe when the value of a textarea changes and to run a function when it does so?
[08:30:06] <Whirl3d> ?.change@neil
[08:30:07] <bot-t> neil, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[08:30:26] <baldaris> Whirl3d:any exmaples code that might be relevent..today is my second day with jquery,after nettuts tutorials..
[08:31:34] <Whirl3d> Neil, change only fires when the element loses focus, however. Otherwise, you have to bind the "focus" event and listen for changes in the textarea value by handling the keypress event on that textarea (while focused)
[08:32:18] <Whirl3d> Neil, but neither of those events are fired if you change the value programmatically, I believe.
[08:33:03] <Neil> Whirl3d: Yes I need something that fires whenever the textarea content changes (be it programmatically or via the user)
[08:34:29] <Whirl3d> Maybe you could use deferreds? I don't know. really, I'm just itching to learn more about deferred's...Maybe you have to just check repeatedly using an interval?
[08:36:31] <Whirl3d> Maybe you could override the jquery .val function to force focus on an element. Then if you applied the value programmatically or manually, the element would get focus and could call an interval checker until the element loses focus.
[08:42:16] <Whirl3d> does anyone know if you bind something like .val to element and then later call the .val function (not using trigger) if the handler would fire??  $("element").bind("val",checkVal);   then later $(element).val(someValue); would that pass someValue to the checkVal handler or would you have to use $(element).trigger("val",someValue); ?
[08:44:05] <Zogot> ud have to use the trigger
[08:44:07] <Zogot> was my understanding
[08:44:32] <Zogot> but you dont need the someValue, just $(element).trigger(event);
[08:44:37] <jackie99> i have a div that I want to attach background
[08:44:40] <jackie99> but it is empty
[08:44:49] <Whirl3d> Some events, like .click don't require trigger. I'm just not sure which are "events"
[08:44:54] <jackie99> do i have to put some text inside so the background image would show?
[08:45:29] <Zogot> jackie99: you can define the width/height of a div in css
[08:45:39] <jackie99> in fact i have top, middle, bottom background that need to be one on top of another
[08:45:47] <jackie99> ok zogot you are right
[08:45:50] <jackie99> i will try that
[08:45:51] <Whirl3d> Zogot, but to pass someValue to the event handler, you would have to have a way to pass it on trigger.
[08:46:23] <Whirl3d> $(element).trigger("someEvent", extraparams);
[08:48:11] <jackie99> it does not work
[08:48:20] <jackie99> i set same dimensions as is the image
[08:48:24] <Zogot> Im a little unsure what exactly your trying to bind whirl3d
[08:52:00] <Whirl3d> btw, I stand corrected on the .trigger event for .click.. Simply using the .click shortcut to bind an event handler will not fire the handler when calling .trigger. You have to explicitly bind the click event to use trigger...not sure about the other events, though.
[08:53:14] <Whirl3d> I was trying to think of a creative way to check for changes on a textarea element that would work whether the changes were applied programmatically or through user input...
[08:55:37] <jackie99> is there a way to make round corners on background and add shadows with css that is compatible with all browsers?
[08:57:20] <Whirl3d> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=css+rounded+corners
[09:10:03] <anli__> To get the local x and y from a mousemove event, I have to do parent traversal?
[09:11:50] <mon_> hi
[09:12:24] <baldaris> Whirl3d:hey ...okay i got the tabs to work for dynamic ids...but all the div with different ids are showing , what can i do to hide remaining tabs?
[09:12:28] <mon_> need some help
[09:13:04] <baldaris> and when i click on any hyperlink , i get like pgp.php?#div id number
[09:14:49] <mon_> http://jsfiddle.net/ZzLyF/
[09:15:21] <mon_> and theres parentheses in annotation.anchortext
[09:15:25] <tom___> i have a grid with a checkbox col on the left and a "check all" checbox in the header of that column. when it checks all the checkboxes, their change events fire. can a change handler delegated to the grid's table element be used here?
[09:15:28] <mon_> q: how to escape
[09:15:40] <tom___>  or must i attach a handler to ever checkbox?
[09:15:46] <mon_> ... the parentheses?
[09:17:23] <mon_> tried google, no luck
[09:17:51] <tom___> mon_: i tried to find the answer to that a few days ago and failed
[09:18:11] <mon_> tom_, i believe you :)
[09:18:38] <tom___> <input name="Dolly[Parton]" …>  how to reference the name in a JQ selector?
[09:18:42] <tom___> i don't know
[09:19:05] <mon_> and the parentheses are needed there (to find a match)
[09:19:05] <dreamss> lmao
[09:19:11] <dreamss> u try \[ ?
[09:19:18] <tom___> y
[09:19:44] <mon_> tom_, u did?
[09:21:19] <Whirl3d> baldaris, use classes (not id's) to group your elements. In other words, have all of the elements you want to show up under tab1 to have the "tab1_grp" class (or whatever you want).
[09:21:58] <Whirl3d> In fact, if you use standard classes for your tabs and keep track of the tab positions of your dynamically created nav elements, it would be easy to get the related content
[09:22:12] <mon_> ... and the parentheses are () (that's the problem I guess)...
[09:23:36] <Whirl3d> In other words:  tab 1 contents would be selected by using the $(".tab1") selector. tab2 would be $(".tab2"). Then when you click on a nav element, bind the .on handler to the parent div of the tabs and use $(".tab"+$(e.target).index()) to select it's content's
[09:24:23] <mon_> error message is : Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :contains(Please, note that the function should be assigned, namely doSomething, not doSomething():).
[09:24:50] <Whirl3d> The nice part about that is that you don't have to rebind the "click" handler every time you regenerate your nav elements (because the .on handler in the parent div does it for you regardless of the new content)
[09:24:58] <tom___> http://jsfiddle.net/gn9Nm/
[09:25:03] <tom___> try to make it work
[09:25:26] <tom___> an answer would be valuable because [] in input names are important
[09:26:03] <tom___> i got it: doube \\
[09:26:05] <tom___> $('input[name=Dolly\\[Parton\\]]').val('Stands by her man');
[09:26:11] <tom___> wirks
[09:26:15] <baldaris> Whirl3d:this is really very powerful...the only option for my problem n php is i had to use iframes..thanks didnt understand everything you said..but definitely pointed in the right direction..so i am somewhere better than no where..lol
[09:26:40] <dnsdds> Is there any specific reason why jQuery UI's .show("blind"); doesn't work on list elements, or am I just doing it wrong?
[09:26:48] <Whirl3d> $("input[name*='parton']")
[09:27:32] <Whirl3d> dnsdds, did you include the blind fx in your UI build?
[09:28:05] <dnsdds> Whirl3d: Yes, I use it all around my project, and this list item is the first time it doesn't work
[09:28:38] <dnsdds> It just bluntly appears, kind of like animating between incompatible values
[09:28:46] <Whirl3d> So, you are sure that you aren't trying the show("blind") before the page loads, right?
[09:28:57] <Whirl3d> hrmmm
[09:29:16] <Whirl3d> does it always bluntly appear, or does it just do it the first time?
[09:29:57] <dnsdds> Every time
[09:30:02] <dnsdds> And it doesn't fire its callback either
[09:30:43] <tom___> A grid has a row-select column of checkboxes on the left and a "check all" checkbox in the header of that column. When check-all changes, JS changes all the row-select checkboxes and their change events fire. Can a checkbox change handler be delegated to the grid's table element and still work?
[09:31:21] <Whirl3d> tom___, you can use the "attribute contains" selector to select your elements like $("input[name*='dolly']").val("gives him two arms to cling to");
[09:31:49] <tom___> Or must there be a change handler on every row-select checkbox?
[09:31:52] <Whirl3d> ?.on @tom___
[09:31:53] <bot-t> tom___, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:32:02] <tom___> i'm using on
[09:32:19] <tom___> it's working great for selecting rows individually
[09:33:15] <tom___> but when the check-all changes state of the checkboxes, the delegated handler isn't firing
[09:33:29] <Whirl3d> $(e.target) will give you the target element. Which should be an element within a cell inside a table if someone clicks on it. So long as you don't stoppropogation or preventdefault or return false
[09:33:57] <tom___> right. the event should bubble up
[09:34:06] <tom___> that's what i would expect
[09:34:23] <Whirl3d> Except that programmatic changes don't fire the change event
[09:34:36] <tom___> no?
[09:35:06] <Whirl3d> I don't think so. I could be wrong, but I think you have to have user input to have the change event fired.
[09:35:40] <Whirl3d> So, one way around it would be to setup an assignvalue function that manually fires the change handler
[09:35:55] <Whirl3d> and use the assignvalue function to assign the value to your elements.
[09:36:04] <tom___> the check-all handling is in a file from the framework si i'd prefer not to change it
[09:36:21] <Whirl3d> function assignValue(targ, val) {targ.val(val); targ.trigger('change');}
[09:36:49] <tom___> so assignvalue would catch the change in value that the framework's js initiates?
[09:38:16] <Whirl3d> $.fn.assignValue=function (val) { return (this.each(function () {$(this).val(val); $(this).fire("change");}));};  $(elem).assignValue(someValue);
[09:38:43] <Whirl3d> *trigger (not fire)
[09:39:27] <Whirl3d> That's why I was asking if anyone knew if you could override the default behavior for .val
[09:40:07] <Whirl3d> $.fn.oldVal=$.fn.val; $.fn.val=function (el, val) { el.oldVal(val); el.trigger('change');}
[09:40:10] <tom___> cool
[09:40:40] <Whirl3d> then $(elem).val('something') might change the value AND fire the change event...but since I am not sure, I was hoping someone else knew.
[09:40:58] <xwurf> hi, $("select").change(function() { ... } fires only the first time when i change a drop down box. anyone know why?
[09:41:42] <tom___> but...
[09:41:52] <tom___> struggling for the words...
[09:42:26] <xwurf> it should also fire when i change the drop down-box value once more again or twice again and so one :)
[09:42:40] <grzesag> Hi, I have list of items, when you click on item I want it to expand/collaps (to see extra text), option to expand/collaps all. Any link to good tutorial? please
[09:42:45] <tom___> the script that iterates through the checkboxes changing them would need to use assignValue() ?
[09:43:13] <tom___> rather than .val() or .prop() or whatever
[09:43:16] <Whirl3d> tom___ unless you could override the default .val() method
[09:43:27] <tom___> ok
[09:43:53] <tom___> better than changing the framework's scripts
[09:44:06] <Whirl3d> if you could override the default .val() method, then you could continue to use .val() {say in some older script that you can't change} while still getting the effect you want.
[09:44:20] <tom___> bit risky. for forwards compat
[09:44:28] <tom___> but might work
[09:44:45] <Whirl3d> You might need to use the proxy method?
[09:44:51] <Whirl3d> ?.proxy
[09:44:52] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[09:45:50] <tom___> this is what is changing the values: http://www.google.com/codesearch#XdEp59TvR34/trunk/framework/zii/widgets/assets/gridview/jquery.yiigridview.js&q=gridview%20package:http://yii%5C.googlecode%5C.com
[09:47:03] <tom___> it's using $checksAll.prop('checked',true) /false
[09:47:20] <Whirl3d> line number?
[09:47:38] <tom___> ~100-110
[09:48:27] <xwurf> thx
[09:49:15] <Whirl3d> $checksAll is a variable that refers to a collection of input elements of class ("select-on-check-all"), right?
[09:49:36] <tom___> hang on
[09:49:48] <tom___> i think that file is too new to be what was in Yii1.1.8
[09:50:11] <tom___> on() is new in jq 1.7?
[09:50:23] <taf2> yep
[09:50:54] <tom___> this is the right one: http://code.google.com/p/yii/source/browse/tags/1.1.8/framework/zii/widgets/assets/gridview/jquery.yiigridview.js
[09:50:58] <IvanKuzev> what are you talking about..i missed a few hundred lines
[09:51:46] <tom___> oh no. it's using attr('checked')
[09:52:52] <Whirl3d> still, what is the problem?
[09:53:15] <tom___> overriding attr() seems risky to me
[09:53:23] <Whirl3d> You don't need to do that.
[09:53:42] <dnsdds> Does .ready() support chaining?
[09:53:51] <Whirl3d> If you want to fire the event "selectionChanged", add a reference to the handler in your constructor.
[09:54:25] <tom___> indeed
[09:54:31] <tom___> that's what i was looking for
[09:54:35] <tom___> thank you
[09:54:36] <Whirl3d> it says: if (settings.selectionChange!==undefined) {settings.selectionChanged(id);}   which says that if you defined sele tionChanged, then it will fire
[09:54:49] <tom___> and it says          * - selectionChanged: function, the function to be called after the row selection is changed
[09:54:51] <Whirl3d> *selectionChanged   sorry
[09:55:26] <tom___> http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CGridView#selectionChanged-detail
[09:55:53] <mon_> i got rid of the error, but the find doesn't work with the escaped parentheses (no match) :(
[09:55:55] <tom___> i was looking in the wrong page of the API spec, on the CCheckBoxColumn spec
[09:56:18] <tom___> spectacular. really. thank you Whirl3d
[09:56:30] <Whirl3d> np
[09:56:50] <tom___> it's the old story: when in doubt. read the code
[09:56:51] <Whirl3d> mon_, did you try the "attribute contains" selector?
[09:57:32] <mon_> Whirl3d, i don't think so
[09:57:52] <Whirl3d> $("input[name*='something']") will select all elements with attribute "name" containing 'something' rather than escaping your ( and )
[09:58:52] <mon_> this http://jsfiddle.net/ZzLyF/    is my code (problem)
[09:59:14] <Whirl3d> dnsdds, what would you need to chain .ready for? You can have multiple .ready handlers....
[09:59:35] <mon_> ... annotation.anchorText  may contain parentheses
[10:00:30] <dnsdds> Whirl3d: Yeah but since the new .on() function apparently needs to be attached to $(document), like .ready(), I was wondering about the possibilities of nigh enough nitpicky optimization by chaining all my on's into the same $(document) selector :P
[10:00:54] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/ZzLyF/1/  mon...try something like this
[10:01:23] <mon_> Whirl3d, ok, thanks
[10:02:06] <Whirl3d> dnsdds, so you are using .on (jquery 1.7+) to handle document-level events (other than .ready)?
[10:02:53] <Whirl3d> $.on can be attached to anything. In fact, it's better to attach it to the top-most common ancestor of the elements you need to handle...
[10:04:23] <dnsdds> Whirl3d: That's what I figured, but the migration guide from .live() at http://api.jquery.com/live/ seems adamant that $(document) needs to be the selector always and forever
[10:04:26] <Whirl3d> in other words, $("form").on({change:function (e) { console.log($(e.target).attr('name')+$(this).attr('id');}}); would fire for each elememt in each form
[10:04:36] <Whirl3d> naw.
[10:05:06] <Whirl3d> The documentation may have said that, but that's only becuase the scope of .live is global
[10:06:15] <Whirl3d> So adding a new element of class "buttonClass" to the document body would require that the .on handler be attached to the document body to replace the functionality of .live
[10:06:55] <Whirl3d> but if you are never going to add "buttonClass" elements to the body element, don't bind .on to the body (or document) unless you need it there.
[10:07:44] <Whirl3d> If you know that all "buttonClass" elements are always going to be inside a "buttonHolder" class element, bind the .on handler to the "buttonHolder" class (or the parent of the buttonHolder class)
[10:09:13] <mon_> Whirl3d, no errors, but won't find
[10:09:34] <xwurf> hi, how can i find out the type of an object, like a input-field or dropdownbox?
[10:09:49] <Whirl3d> mon_ what is annotation.anchorText?
[10:10:28] <mon_> i'll check
[10:11:12] <Whirl3d> xwurf, you could use typeof to determine the javascript element type, but $.type() for jquery elements
[10:11:41] <mon_> Whirl3d, it's a paragrap (in this case)
[10:11:48] <mon_> it depends
[10:12:20] <Whirl3d> so you are managing a jquery object called annotation, right?
[10:12:28] <xwurf> ty, whirl3d
[10:12:38] <mon_> hm
[10:12:53] <xwurf> finally, i use is("select")
[10:13:35] <Whirl3d> *javascript object, not jquery object...
[10:13:44] <mon_> Whirl3d, yes
[10:14:19] <Whirl3d> mon_ did you console.log(annotation) before you applied your selector.
[10:14:46] <Whirl3d> Because if annotation.anchorText is undefined, the selector will fail silently and return an array of 0 elements.
[10:14:55] <mon_> it's working ok, when there's no parentheses
[10:15:27] <mon_> the anchorText is ok
[10:15:34] <Whirl3d> so your input elements have literal "(" in them?
[10:15:42] <mon_> yep
[10:15:43] <Whirl3d> in their name attributes?
[10:15:59] <Whirl3d> Change them to ['s and it should work
[10:16:04] <mon_> the text is originally from the page
[10:16:28] <mon_> and it's used in matching
[10:16:40] <mon_> to find the orginal place
[10:17:14] <Whirl3d> You have completely lost me. do you have a url I could look at?
[10:17:35] <mon_> sorry no
[10:17:44] <mon_> it's an extension (FF)
[10:17:56] <mon_> i mean the code
[10:18:30] <Whirl3d> so are you trying to make a footnote widget or something?
[10:18:36] <mon_> yep
[10:18:51] <Whirl3d> and the references you want to store are to input elements?
[10:19:30] <mon_> hm
[10:20:40] <mon_> the annotations are for a text on a page
[10:20:58] <mon_> which are selected using a mouse
[10:21:50] <Whirl3d> You know how difficult it is to get the selected text to work cross-browser, right?
[10:22:05] <Whirl3d> in FF it's easy, but in IE, it's a real pain
[10:22:06] <mon_> yeah
[10:22:44] <Whirl3d> so where do you have elements with names that contain '(' ?
[10:22:49] <mon_> easier in exetension when the code is run only in one browser
[10:23:24] <mon_> the parentheses are in the paragraph (on a page)
[10:23:48] <mon_> in a ...
[10:24:22] <Whirl3d> paragraph element?
[10:24:30] <mon_> no names or input elements
[10:24:45] <mon_> yes
[10:24:50] <mon_> <p>
[10:25:10] <mon_> in this particular case
[10:26:01] <Whirl3d> so , you get the selection of the mouse (which gives you a string with ( and ) in it), and save that in a variable called selectedText....then you want to find the input element with the name stored in the variable selectText, right?
[10:26:15] <mon_> something like that
[10:26:26] <mon_> i use SQLite for a db
[10:26:34] <mon_> to store the info
[10:27:43] <mon_> and when I later browse to the same page the add on will check if there are any annotations for that page
[10:28:05] <mon_> and show them using css
[10:28:17] <mon_> and so on
[10:28:25] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/QnWUZ/1/
[10:29:02] <mon_> i'll check that
[10:29:22] <mon_> Whirl3d, thanks for ur time
[10:29:24] <mon_> gtg
[10:29:31] <Whirl3d> using the "attribute contains" selector [attrname*='value']  allows you to use part of the search to find it
[10:29:35] <Whirl3d> have a good one.
[10:29:42] <mon_> ok
[10:29:49] <mon_> cya
[10:31:02] <jackie99> where to get facebook twitter like script?
[10:31:21] <jackie99> it should show the number of times the page was submitted, what do you people use?
[10:31:54] <xwurf> btw: sorry for confusing some things (javascript-object, jquery-object...). i'am new to jquery so sorry for my confusion and ty for your patience ;)
[10:32:10] <Whirl3d> xwurf, no worries.
[10:32:52] <Whirl3d> I don't use facebook or twitter, really, so I am likely no help to you jackie99. sry

[10:38:39] <nexus74> slideToggle is turning my element invisible - I only want it to slide down to a min-hight
[10:38:46] <nexus74> http://pastebin.com/YHHXenVa
[10:39:36] <Whirl3d> nexus, use .animate() instead.
[10:39:42] <nexus74> my CSS:http://pastebin.com/m12jv0P3
[10:40:02] <nexus74> Whirl3d: ok, but I still ned a way to toggle
[10:41:48] <Whirl3d> I have to run. in your custom func, check state function mySlideToggle(element, opts) {if (element.is(".extended")) {elem.animate(upCSS).removeClass("extended");} else {element.animate(downCss).addClass("extended");}}
[10:42:20] <nexus74> Whirl3d: ok, thank you
[10:42:42] <Whirl3d> I can maybe help more later but that should get you headed in the right direction. Good luck.
[10:42:45] <Whirl3d> Good day all.
[10:42:49] <nexus74> ty
[10:45:00] <nexus74> If anyone can help: http://jsfiddle.net/6zUTr/  I need my footerSlideContainer to animate down to 75 px, not turn invisible...is there anyway to override slideToggle visiblity?
[10:45:30] <Eviltwin> ?demo
[10:45:31] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[10:45:43] <Eviltwin> "a live (working) demo"
[10:46:00] <nexus74> @bot-t ok, I'll have to add HTML...thought what I had may be enough...
[10:46:42] <Eviltwin> The goal is for us to see the problem
[10:49:35] <Eviltwin> You also don't need 49 lines of code to animate a slide
[10:50:38] <nexus74> Eviltwin: this uses a cookie to track animation states
[10:51:15] <nexus74> Eviltwin: so when the page is refreshed, it remembers if it was expanded or collapsed
[10:51:30] <nexus74> Eviltwin: i know that part works
[10:52:08] <Eviltwin> Then see ?jdb
[10:52:09] <bot-t> We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[10:52:47] <nexus74> I AM using jsFiddle...I'm just trying to get it work there before I post the link to my fiddle here
[10:53:01] <Eviltwin> That's what we're looking for
[10:53:10] <nexus74> ok...working on that
[10:57:14] <nexus74> I wonder if the cookie aspect is interfering with jsFiddle...
[10:58:35] <nexus74> http://jsfiddle.net/6zUTr/10/
[10:58:44] <nexus74> click on the yellow square
[11:00:32] <nexus74> nvm...Its not working
[11:00:46] <Eviltwin> You need to add the cookie plugin under Add Resources
[11:01:00] <nexus74> ahhh...thank you!
[11:01:30] <nexus74> ugh...its a local site..not public
[11:01:51] <nexus74> so I just need one of my sites that is using the plugin and I can path to there
[11:02:03] <Eviltwin> See if it's on the Google CDN
[11:04:50] <nexus74> hmm don't think it is
[11:05:25] <nexus74> well i have the cookie logic working, so I could just delete the cookie aspect from the code...my main issue is the animation
[11:07:40] <nexus74> mmm...logic is cookie dependant... I appreciate you guys looking into this.. I'll rework the code then come back with a working demo
[11:08:10] <Eviltwin> You said that the cookie part worked, right?
[11:08:16] <nexus74> yes
[11:08:23] <Eviltwin> So why don't you just remove that for now
[11:08:29] <Eviltwin> Use a var instead or something
[11:08:35] <nexus74> That's what I'm doing
[11:08:42] <nexus74> ok
[11:11:25] <Eviltwin> nexus74: Are you looking for something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6JtfD/
[11:12:58] <nexus74> here we go: http://jsfiddle.net/6zUTr/13/
[11:13:31] <Eviltwin> So, what's the goal?
[11:13:37] <nexus74> the CSS to focus on starts near the bottom of the CSS window with #footer
[11:13:59] <nexus74> the goal is to have the element slide to a min height, not dissappear
[11:14:09] <Eviltwin> Did you see what I posted?
[11:14:35] <nexus74> Yes, I'm looking at that now. thank you
[11:15:13] <nexus74> just out of curiosity, there is no way to override slideToggle visibility property?
[11:16:11] <Eviltwin> You're probably want to see ?.toggle
[11:16:12] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[11:16:43] <nexus74> when i used .toggle, it hid my element...
[11:17:13] <Eviltwin> Well .toggle() can take two functions
[11:17:19] <Eviltwin> It runs the first one on the first click
[11:17:24] <Eviltwin> The second one on the second click
[11:17:29] <Eviltwin> The first one on the third click
[11:17:30] <Eviltwin> And so on
[11:17:52] <nexus74> ah yes...and tried to implement that in my code... I will try again
[11:17:55] <Eviltwin> slideToggle simply calls .animate() and then whatever
[11:18:05] <Eviltwin> Like changing the display property
[11:20:00] <nexus74> well on mine, slideToggle is hidding the element after the animation completes- I've got a min height set now: http://jsfiddle.net/6zUTr/14/
[11:20:08] <nexus74> click on the yellow square
[11:24:40] <Eviltwin> Just use .animate in the if/else statement instead of .slideToggle
[11:25:27] <nexus74> ok
[11:28:01] <beWilled> when using JQUERY.getJSON(getURL, function(){}) should I enconde the getURL if it contains UTF8 characters such as ñ or í?
[11:28:30] <Eviltwin> Depends on what the server accepts
[11:28:41] <beWilled> Eviltwin php
[11:28:52] <snover> that’s not what the server accepts.
[11:28:54] <Eviltwin> Here
[11:28:55] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[11:28:56] <bot-t> Try It And See
[11:30:02] <beWilled> It seems to be replacing the special characters with '?' on the getURL page
[11:37:22] <beWilled> lets say I enconde í into htmlentity format, that it will replace that character with "&iacute;" but would the "&" create conflict with the GET url what seperates parameters with &= ?
[11:38:15] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:38:46] <Eviltwin> Which is why there's encodeURIComponent
[12:04:01] <Deafgoose> how can I change a attr of an element from an iframe (same domain)? top.$('.testSingleForum').attr('href',"newlink.html") and parent.$('.testSingleForum').attr('href',"newlink.html"), no success
[12:07:04] <nexus74> Eviltwin: got it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/6zUTr/15/
[12:07:07] <nexus74> thank you
[12:07:11] <Eviltwin> Good
[12:07:48] <nexus74> If anyone's interested, here's a sliding footer that remembers animation states with page refreshes: http://jsfiddle.net/6zUTr/15/

[12:12:51] <styol> Why is it that $('.element').click(function(){}); happens multiple times even when there is only 1 occurrence of the element being clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/nSC88/1/
[12:13:30] <Eviltwin> Because you subsequently trigger a click on the elemnet
[12:13:32] <Eviltwin> element*
[12:14:05] <Deafgoose> how can I change a attr of an element from an iframe (same domain)? top.$('.testSingleForum').attr('href',"newlink.html") and parent.$('.testSingleForum').attr('href',"newlink.html"), no success
[12:14:23] <Eviltwin> $(".foo").click(function(){$(".foo").click()}) causes an infinite loop of clicking
[12:14:39] <styol> Eviltwin: ah, link.find('.flag').click(); ? how would i target a child of the element being clicked
[12:15:58] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: I know it's verbose but try parent.document.window.$
[12:16:16] <Eviltwin> styol: What do you mean "target"?
[12:16:26] <styol> Eviltwin: select
[12:16:41] <Eviltwin> Why would you think .click() would come in to that?
[12:16:53] <Deafgoose> Eviltwin I get parent is null
[12:17:33] <Eviltwin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/935127/how-to-access-parent-iframe-from-javascript
[12:17:43] <Eviltwin> Deafgoose: What's the exact URL of the page and the exact URL of the iframe
[12:17:53] <Eviltwin> Because it sounds like you're violating SOP somewhere
[12:18:08] <Eviltwin> Unless you're doing like var parent somehwere
[12:18:10] <Eviltwin> somewhere*
[12:18:12] <Eviltwin> Try window.parent
[12:18:44] <Deafgoose> window.parent is null
[12:18:58] <Eviltwin> Then you may need to see ?sop
[12:18:59] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[12:19:05] <FerchoLP> I'm having some trouble with jquery UI. It's strange, when I load page through codeigniter, I have the js error "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'accordion'". BUT if I go to "View source code", copy and paste the code in a plain html and open it, the js works fine.
[12:19:05] <Deafgoose> evil twin, both are actualy same page, same domain
[12:19:06] <FerchoLP> the pages have exactly the same source code, but the one that is php-generated doesn't work and the other which is plain html works ok
[12:19:20] <Deafgoose> however one runs php code based on query string
[12:19:27] <Deafgoose> so cant be violating sop
[12:20:07] <styol> Eviltwin: I don't understand the question, sorry. A parent element has two children: one image (not shown) and one link. My goal is that when the parent in general is clicked, that it triggers the click of the link (IE: when you click the image or surounding area)
[12:20:32] <Eviltwin> styol: Look up event bubbling
[12:24:52] <FerchoLP> I think http://wordpress.org/support/topic/include-jquery-in-headerphp-please-help may be a solution
[12:25:51] <FerchoLP> mm
[12:35:42] <Cokegod> how can I use triggerHandler on delegated events?
[12:49:42] <loqui> Hi, do you know how I can replace a content by an other content (who is stored in a php file)?
[13:08:31] <Stooge> $.each in this what '$' stands for?
[13:08:35] <Stooge> instead of document?
[13:09:21] <ph7labs> on illuniverse.com - i need to enlarge these planets to 75px
[13:09:24] <Eviltwin> Stooge: jQuery...
[13:09:50] <Stooge> and jQuery is some object?
[13:10:10] <Eviltwin> Do you know what jQuery is?
[13:10:32] <Stooge> till now i thought its a library in javascript
[13:11:01] <Eviltwin> And how do you think JavaScript libraries work?
[13:11:35] <Stooge> by adding new functions?
[13:11:43] <Stooge> dunno how the selectors work thought
[13:12:00] <Eviltwin> Well if it just adds a bunch of new functions that's kind of messy
[13:12:10] <Eviltwin> So what most good libraries do is put them in a namespace
[13:12:17] <Eviltwin> <libraryname>.<function name>
[13:12:25] <Stooge> so the library name is $?
[13:12:27] <Eviltwin> For jQuery the library name is "jQuery"
[13:12:29] <Stooge> great :)
[13:12:34] <Eviltwin> And in your case the function name is "each"
[13:12:39] <Stooge> kk ty
[13:12:49] <Eviltwin> jQuery also adds an alias of "$" that can be removed via calling jQuery.noConflict9)
[13:12:54] <Eviltwin> jQuery.noConflict()
[13:13:31] <Eviltwin> The selectors are just an extension of CSS selectors
[13:14:01] <Stooge> i am looking at some code that i haven't written and its weird :)

[13:15:12] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[13:16:07] <Stooge> well whatever too weird and long for me to bother thanks again :)
[13:16:22] <Eviltwin> Okay then...
[13:23:49] <mikl> I have a weird issue with a jQuery UI dialog that closes automatically after an AJAX callback inside it returns. Can you help me figure out why it closes? It is closed, even if line 277 of the file is commented out: http://drupalcode.org/project/opening_hours.git/blob/refs/heads/6.x-1.x:/js/opening_hours.views.js
[13:24:33] <mikl> and, additionally, the close event on the dialog does not seem to fire…
[13:28:50] <slorbast> Can anyone supply a basic $.getJSON example? The ones on jquery.com don't even have the source for test.js which is half of the example.
[13:30:02] <Eviltwin> slorbast: $.getJSON("/path/to/a.json",function(json) { ... });
[13:32:27] <Eviltwin> slorbast: What more do you need?
[13:33:26] <ajpiano> probably an exacmple of actual json
[13:34:35] <Eviltwin> Oh, I was looking at the 1.7.1 source and noticed this weird asymmetry: http://pastebin.com/dpZikzeA
[13:50:29] <b_52globe> any tuto explaining selecting one icon from a png image containing many icon like jquery one's
[13:50:48] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:50:56] <abjorn> :o
[13:51:24] <ajpiano> i think he's asking how css sprites work
[13:51:45] <slorbast> Bah, the problem was accessing jquery.min.js, thanks guys
[13:52:31] <b_52globe> css sprites it's called
[13:52:35] <b_52globe> ajpiano, thanks
[13:52:44] <ajpiano> :)
[13:54:37] <Nate_> New to Jquery and Ive got a problem, I can seem to get my page with nested tabs to work properly. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14080718/Final/TabsInTabs.html
[13:54:44] <Nate_> any ideas?
[13:55:06] <Eviltwin> Nate_: What's not working?
[13:55:19] <Nate_> my subnav
[13:56:02] <Nate_> It is actually a nested tab set up
[13:56:08] <Stooge> how to make i++; inside $.each()?
[13:57:15] <Nate_> ya, I think so, this is my first time editing jquery, so I dont know too much.
[13:57:16] <Eviltwin> Stooge: You can't exactly
[13:58:15] <Nate_> Is there another way to get it to work?
[13:59:06] <Eviltwin> Looking
[14:07:16] <slorbast> Oh waow, can do some pretty cool stuff between PHP and JQuery stuffs
[14:07:36] <Stooge> ^^
[14:07:53] <Stooge> yeah done that too but stopped using php :p
[14:08:20] <slorbast> I'd like to get into more python, what server side scripting do you use now?
[14:08:28] <Stooge> java
[14:08:46] <slorbast> They have a good library for stuffs?
[14:09:12] <Eviltwin> I've not really explored the options but we were using Pyramid/Pylons
[14:09:18] <Stooge> i have done parsing a CSV file with php and then passing the values to javascript and using google chart library :) and drawing chart with it
[14:10:23] <Stooge> there are very nice lybraries and you can create very rich applications with java easier than with php...
[14:10:58] <Eviltwin> Well Java makes things heavy
[14:11:24] <Stooge> the company i work for chooses what ill code on :)
[14:12:00] <Stooge> yeah the library i am using atm creates huge html and huge javascript and huge css and lots of inline styles the sites load really slow...
[14:13:07] <minna> Hello, i can't get this to work: $("#test").prop("onchange", null); the attribute is still there... I tried removeAttr instead of prop, and that works. But have problems in IE6-8.
[14:15:44] <Eviltwin> minna: Try removeProp?
[14:16:08] <Stooge> Eviltwin so instead of making $.each i need to use foreach in so i can make i++ in it?
[14:16:12] <Eviltwin> I recall something on the attr/prop/removeAttr/removeProp about IE and on<x> handlers
[14:16:25] <Eviltwin> Stooge: Make a jsFiddle of what you're trying to do
[14:17:14] <minna> Eviltwin: Just found removeprop. Yes, i can't use removeprop on checked, disabled or selected.
[14:17:19] <minna> *shouldn't
[14:17:51] <ajpiano> Stooge: what are you trying to do.  $.each() tells you the current loop index as an argument, you don't have to "make i
[14:18:01] <ajpiano> "make i++ in it"
[14:18:15] <Stooge> yeah i am stupid ... saw my error now
[14:18:17] <ajpiano> if there's some other variable you want to increment from within an each loop, then you just go ahead and do it
[14:18:24] <minna> removeprop did not work either
[14:18:33] <Stooge> i make $.each(var i = 0; i++ ) and each time
[14:18:36] <minna> what the hell is going on here
[14:18:36] <Stooge> i = 1.......
[14:18:37] <Stooge> fail
[14:18:55] <ajpiano> lol
[14:19:33] <minna> I even ran $("#test").removeProp("onchange"); in the console, it's still there!
[14:19:48] <Stooge> the bad thing is that i was doing this for 1-2 times per day for 3-4 days 2 months ago and then recently i started doing again :( my favorite error........
[14:28:24] <minna> Seriously, why isn't this working??!
[14:28:25] <minna> http://jsfiddle.net/jGzzD/
[14:31:09] <cornfeed> hello
[14:31:25] <cornfeed> i am having an odd response with a small bit of code....
[14:31:26] <cornfeed> http://dpaste.de/eYEiA/
[14:31:59] <cornfeed> once I click the button , once instead of changing the .click function, it seems to execute it...
[14:38:31] <razzi> minna works here (in chrome)
[14:40:44] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: Do you understand the difference between referencing a function and executing a function?
[14:42:59] <chovy> anyone know how to do a scrolling menu like the one here (left side): http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car/index#/leaf-electric-car/index
[14:44:22] <minna> razzi: what version?
[14:44:51] <cornfeed> Eviltwin: sorry, yes i adjust the code, still having a similar but different issue
[14:45:00] <razzi> minna, in ie8 it didn't work
[14:45:01] <cornfeed> i saw it right after i pasted
[14:45:30] <razzi> chrome v 15
[14:46:16] <cornfeed> this seems to cause it to run cpanel_filters_ruleadd as many times as there are text boxes in an odd loop i havent figured out just yet
[14:46:18] <cornfeed> http://dpaste.de/6P3Na/
[14:49:30] <burdickjp> I'm trying to get a select element to change the contents of a peer div, but not the div of another parent:
[14:49:32] <burdickjp> http://jsfiddle.net/pCCFD/2/
[14:53:21] <cornfeed> burdickjp: $(this).next().html(this.options[this.selectedIndex].getAttribute('item_price'));
[14:53:26] <razzi> burdickjp,  $(this).siblings(".item_price") instead of  $(".item_price")
[14:53:34] <cornfeed> or that
[14:53:41] <razzi> or that
[14:53:45] <cornfeed> hehehe
[14:54:59] <burdickjp> razzi:  I was just looking at that on the jquery site
[14:55:01] <burdickjp> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[14:55:06] <burdickjp> thank you!
[14:56:04] <burdickjp> success!
[14:56:11] <cornfeed> that second paste i put up, is there something i am missing?
[14:57:14] <cornfeed> i have dynamic rows for add email filters, and i need to be able to re-number after add/del but that affects the onclick= that the html puts in
[14:57:31] <cornfeed> php*
[14:59:03] <razzi> Corey, which paste?
[14:59:07] <razzi> cornfeed*
[14:59:16] <cornfeed> http://dpaste.de/6P3Na/
[14:59:32] <cornfeed> i just realized, is there a way to pass $i differently? is that the cause?
[15:00:00] <cornfeed> i thought it would set the handler and the variable it needs to pass on
[15:02:29] <cornfeed> I am about to rewrite from scratch
[15:02:38] <cornfeed> this plugin is driving me nuts
[15:24:17] <chrislabeard> Hey everyone I'm trying to do an accordion but I have a problem with the list is really long so I added .scrollTo() but it doesn't seem to be working -- http://smartercampaigns.com/services
[15:29:16] <gloomer> chrislabeard what is not working for you?
[15:30:10] <chrislabeard> gloomer: it scrolls to the bottom of the list
[15:30:20] <chrislabeard> if you click the first one then scroll to the second it goes to the middle
[15:32:21] <gloomer> what browser?
[15:32:57] <gloomer> ohh I see what your saying
[15:33:05] <gloomer> so first accordian open, then scroll to second and open it?
[15:33:12] <gloomer> and it closes first but then scrolls to middle?
[15:35:34] <RandalSchwartz> in $(nodeselector).click(function ... )
[15:35:52] <RandalSchwartz> is there any easy way to know which node index it as
[15:35:58] <RandalSchwartz> like when you call .each() ?
[15:36:13] <RandalSchwartz> or do I need to call each, and then click...
[15:36:52] <Stooge> you want to add to every node a click event?
[15:36:58] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[15:37:14] <RandalSchwartz> every node of a particular selector expression
[15:37:17] <Stooge> did you try  $(nodeselector).click(function ... ) as you said?
[15:37:25] <Stooge> without each?
[15:37:27] <RandalSchwartz> yes.  but how do I know 1 vs 2 with 3
[15:37:39] <RandalSchwartz> I need to know which ordinal position each was
[15:37:46] <Stooge> you can add some if inside the function
[15:37:47] <RandalSchwartz> .each() can tell me
[15:39:17] <RandalSchwartz> some "if"?
[15:39:42] <RandalSchwartz> I just need a var with i, the same way .each(function(i, node) { ... }) has
[15:39:43] <gloomer> if else
[15:43:27] <RandalSchwartz> so - no?
[15:43:31] <RandalSchwartz> I have to drop to an each?
[15:45:48] <cornfeed> gloomer: Object function (a,b){return new D.fn.init(a,b)} has no method 'scrollTo'
[15:48:31] <RandalSchwartz> ...     $("tfoot input[type=text]", $thistable).each(function(i, item) {      $(item).keyup(function() {
[15:48:45] <RandalSchwartz> so now I have "i" for the position of i within the original list
[15:48:50] <RandalSchwartz> but it seems like that might be a common thing
[15:49:44] <zeppo> anyone done any work with Raphael JS?
[15:54:50] <cornfeed> zeppo: no but that looks neat thanks
[15:55:09] <zeppo> yeah its great
[15:55:21] <cornfeed> holy crap this is neat
[15:55:52] <gloomer> bookmarked
[15:55:52] <cornfeed> HAHA http://raphaeljs.com/scape/
[15:55:53] <gloomer> lol
[15:55:54] <gloomer> nice
[15:55:57] <cornfeed> wow
[15:57:47] <SlexAxton> RandalSchwartz: yea, each is needed there
[15:57:58] <SlexAxton> it is not worse performance
[15:58:13] <SlexAxton> because there's an implicit call to each in the .click call for multiple elements
[15:58:18] <SlexAxton> but it is a touch uglier for sure
[15:59:17] <ajpiano> RandalSchwartz: you can theoretically cheat a little
[15:59:24] <ajpiano> and figure out the index inside the handler
[16:00:04] <ajpiano> if you have a cached set of elements, like var divs = $("div").click(function() {  var index = divs.index( this );  });
[16:00:05] <ajpiano> then you don't *actually* need an each
[16:00:32] <ajpiano> whether that's "cheating" or exactly what you wanted to do, i'm not sure ;)
[16:01:12] <RandalSchwartz> yeah - I had that, but I wanted to be a bit cleaner than recomputing the original set again.
[16:02:48] <goldroger> hi guys a question please - is there a way to emit keyboard events programmatically ?
[16:03:04] <goldroger> for example, can I emulate a keypress ?
[16:03:54] <gloomer> goldroger where?
[16:03:59] <gloomer> in what context
[16:04:04] <goldroger> gloomer: in the browser window
[16:04:24] <KWhat_Mobile> where can i go to get help with jquery ui css overflow issues due to border width?
[16:04:57] <KWhat_Mobile> i have been fucking with this for about 8 hours now and i cant get this peice of shit to stop pushing crap down
[16:05:18] <goldroger> basically gloomer, I want the default keypress event handler to be executed on some other inputs that I generate that
[16:05:21] <goldroger> can I do this ?
[16:05:26] <gloomer> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/#eventdata
[16:05:40] <gloomer> KWhat_Mobile example plz
[16:05:56] <KWhat_Mobile> gloomer: this going to be a little diffuclt
[16:06:14] <gloomer> jsfiddle preferably
[16:06:16] <goldroger> wow sounds really simple
[16:06:18] <goldroger> thanks
[16:06:27] <goldroger> gloomer:
[16:06:34] <gloomer> np
[16:08:09] <dogarrhea2> does appending things change the z order of objects?
[16:09:38] <KWhat_Mobile> gloomer: well i think i broke jsfiddle
[16:09:45] <KWhat_Mobile> there is no option for jquery ui 19
[16:10:29] <ryan_scott> Hey all.
[16:11:23] <KWhat_Mobile> can u include a link to js file wiht jsfiddle?
[16:11:36] <ryan_scott> I'm new to JQuery and trying to do some drag and drop where the object is moved to be a child of the droppable.  I've got that working, but the position of the draggable seems to be where it was last during dragging.
[16:11:47] <ryan_scott> (as opposed to where it would be based on classes and the like).
[16:11:54] <ryan_scott> Any thoughts?
[16:13:20] <Bogardi23> can anyone please help me get scrollable working?
[16:13:42] <tom___> Can someone help me understand why this fadeOut() doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/NDvaa/2/
[16:13:55] <tom___> when you mouse over the image and then mouse out, it hides
[16:14:16] <tom___> but change the hide() to fadeOut() and it doesn't fade out.
[16:16:31] <tom___> slideUp() also doesn't work
[16:17:17] <tom___> is it because the copy is positioned absolutely?
[16:18:09] <gloomer> I have a issue with autocomplete drop down not staying attached to textbox when page is scrolled
[16:19:13] <KWhat_Mobile> gloomer: http://jsfiddle.net/meg2y/1/
[16:19:27] <KWhat_Mobile> gloomer: run with something that supports jquery ui menu
[16:20:05] <KWhat_Mobile> gloomer: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu
[16:23:53] <gloomer> KWhat_Mobile whats problem with your js?
[16:24:45] <KWhat_Mobile> its a problem with the css
[16:24:55] <gloomer> the margin?
[16:24:58] <KWhat_Mobile> it keeps inserting about 2px from the border on the highlight
[16:25:33] <KWhat_Mobile> the margin -1px fixes if for the initial add however when you hover above or below that element in the menu the 2px automagically come bakc
[16:25:50] <KWhat_Mobile> i cant for the life of my figure out why
[16:26:42] <KWhat_Mobile> if i remove the border on the highlight class it works,
[16:26:51] <KWhat_Mobile> (without the margin -1)
[16:33:08] <ryan_scott> In case anyone has issues with drag+drop and positioning, wiping out top and left using .css() work for me.
[16:37:28] <diverdud`> Hello, is there a good richtext editor you can recommend?
[16:38:02] <KWhat_Mobile> diverdud`: idk about jquery compatible but there are a few out there, fckeditor use to be my fav
[16:40:07] <diverdud`> KWhat_Mobile: yeah ok.....taht seems like it really has a lot of tools. Is it modifyable?
[16:40:24] <diverdud`> if i eg. only want paragraphs, smileys, italic, fontsize
[16:42:28] <KWhat_Mobile> diverdud`: honestly its been quite a few years sense i have deployed it.  it is open source and you can def modify the toolbar contents.
[16:43:04] <KWhat_Mobile> gloomer: i think i have a hack around.
[16:44:02] <KWhat_Mobile> got to love the invisible borders
[16:45:07] <diverdud`> markitup looks really nice
[16:46:11] <kenthree> imagine I have an html page in a string, any way I can run selectors on it to grab text without creating dom elements?
[16:46:45] <dnsdds> Is there a neat way to append a complex element and .show() it with a jQuery UI animation while avoiding FOUC?
[16:47:35] <RandalSchwartz> kenthree - you can create disconnected nodes
[16:47:43] <RandalSchwartz> they don't have to be part of the tree
[16:48:14] <RandalSchwartz> $('<b>some html here</b>').find('b')
[16:48:23] <kenthree> RandalSchwartz: It could have all sorts of stuff in there like script tags
[16:48:29] <RandalSchwartz> that's not part of the dom
[16:48:37] <RandalSchwartz> and script tags would not be run, I suspect
[16:48:54] <RandalSchwartz> not until added to <body>
[16:48:57] <RandalSchwartz> or <head>
[16:50:07] <kenthree> hmm all right i'll try thanks
[16:50:45] <RandalSchwartz> yeah just tried it
[16:51:02] <RandalSchwartz> <script> doesn't execute until I did .appendTo('body')
[16:51:06] <kenthree> actually I tried that in the past and had some problems.. for example <img src= would trigger a file request
[16:51:23] <RandalSchwartz> I think if you keep it out of the dom, it won't fire
[16:52:03] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, yeah, it seems img src fires in the debugger
[16:52:07] <RandalSchwartz> not sure what it does it real code
[16:52:50] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, that's because I did an illegal URL
[16:52:59] <RandalSchwartz> with a legal one, doesnt' seem to have fired any net IO
[16:53:02] <kenthree> I guess I was hoping there's a "parse" only way be it jquery or some other
[16:53:15] <kenthree> ah
[16:53:25] <RandalSchwartz> the best HTML parser is built in to the browser. :)
[16:53:31] <kenthree> true
[16:53:33] <diverdud`> hmm markitup was not as good as i thought
[16:53:36] <RandalSchwartz> and from there you get a nice disconnected DOM thing
[16:55:08] <kenthree> getting my feet wet with the winrt stuff
[17:04:34] <TeamColtra> Hi, I have a countdown timer that I am currently using .load() to keep refreshing a php script which tells how many seconds are left, however, it doesn't stop once it hits zero and it's just a ton of page refreshes so I was assuming there was a better way?
[17:08:58] <KWhat_Mobile> TeamColtra: why would you need a php script to tell you how many seconds are left if you just query it once and set the timer it should stay in sync right
[17:09:05] <kenthree> RandalSchwartz: do you know what happens as far as memory usage? will there be a massive leak every time a new string is loaded?
[17:09:44] <TeamColtra> KWhat_Mobile, I didn't know there was a timer function... then again I have been looking for "countdown jquery" which hasn't been giving me anything useful
[17:11:01] <KWhat_Mobile> TeamColtra: its part of js
[17:11:13] <RandalSchwartz> kenthree - I suspect it'll just be gc'ed
[17:11:20] <RandalSchwartz> unless you keep a ref to it somewhere
[17:12:11] <KWhat_Mobile> TeamColtra: http://www.elated.com/articles/javascript-timers-with-settimeout-and-setinterval/
[17:12:28] <KWhat_Mobile> that covers most of it
[17:13:01] <KWhat_Mobile> probably save your webserver a bunch of requests as well ;)
[17:14:30] <TeamColtra> :P Very much so.. though the problem is that most of these ask for dates, and I don't have a date to give it... I only know its like 200 seconds in the future. The article you linked me to doesn't acutally produce a visual counter.
[17:14:58] <TeamColtra> The idea is something like those filesharing sites where they count down from 20 then after the time's up they reveal a link
[17:15:10] <TeamColtra> actually... maybe I will just go take a look at how they do it :D
[17:15:46] <KWhat_Mobile> you can probably just do now() + 20000 or something like that
[17:16:24] <KWhat_Mobile> if you want to count down from 20 just execute the timer event every 1000 ms and decrement from 20
[17:16:30] <KWhat_Mobile> till its zero then clear
[17:16:47] <RandalSchwartz> although that may not be precise
[17:16:54] <RandalSchwartz> you might want to keep asking for time each time
[17:18:28] <TeamColtra> I found this: http://paste2.org/p/1818123
[17:18:34] <TeamColtra> (on one of the filesharing sites)
[17:18:34] <KWhat_Mobile> if your doing it in JS your going to have to verify on the backend the the amount of time has passed on submit or they can cheat regardless
[17:18:55] <KWhat_Mobile> but if your polling the backend every second your servers going to get raped
[17:19:08] <RandalSchwartz> TeamColtra - that can get skew like I said before
[17:19:18] <RandalSchwartz> a delay of 1 second doesnt' mean you fire every one second
[17:19:31] <RandalSchwartz> you want to get the current time of day when you wake up
[17:19:39] <RandalSchwartz> and drive decisions on that
[17:20:06] <TeamColtra> I am not too concerned with accuracy, I doubt that they will lose too much sync in 300 seconds and it's just for a game... I already have systems in place to ensure that they don't click too soon
[17:20:10] <RandalSchwartz> oh gawd... if (str.length == 1) str = '0' + str;
[17:20:16] <RandalSchwartz> please people, stop doing that. :(
[17:20:38] <KWhat_Mobile> ive seen worse
[17:20:44] <RandalSchwartz> does nobody understand sprintf?
[17:20:46] <TeamColtra> :P Heck, I can just add one second to defend against any weird things
[17:58:58] <kenthree> kind of a shame that animations dont use css transitions.. is there no discussion of this going on? people dont really seem to care
[17:59:16] <kenthree> there's a couple hacks out but its stuff from 2009
[18:00:54] <pm_> i am noob. can any body tell what does "$", means in a statement like -  $.getJSON ?
[18:01:52] <kenthree> $ is the name of the global jquery object
[18:02:39] <RandalSchwartz> $ == jQuery :)
[18:02:56] <pm_> thanks Kenthree & Randal
[18:03:09] <RandalSchwartz> except when it isn't
[18:03:18] <RandalSchwartz> like you're trying to mix prototype.js and jQuery
[18:03:23] <RandalSchwartz> in which case, you can use:
[18:03:34] <RandalSchwartz> jQuery(function($) { .... });
[18:03:44] <RandalSchwartz> and in that function excuted on-load, you get $ as jQuery again
[18:04:04] <pm_> alright.. right now i am not using prototype.js
[18:05:01] <RandalSchwartz> that model is nice to always follow though
[18:05:16] <RandalSchwartz> to get your data to have local scope, use $, and also be executed only after load
[18:07:22] <pm_> @randalschwartz i tried to print $ - it came back as function(a,b) {return new e.fn(a,b,h)}
[18:07:31] <RandalSchwartz> sure
[18:07:35] <RandalSchwartz> that's jQuery for ya
[18:08:03] <pm_> gotcha
[18:08:09] <dogarrhea2> i have a css style that specifies -84px.  I use animate and nothing happens. when I remove the style things animate.
[18:08:19] <dogarrhea2> how do i set things in a certain position and then allow them to be animated ater
[18:08:22] <dogarrhea2> later*
[18:08:35] * RandalSchwartz defers to the Smart People of the channel
[18:14:00] <pm_> I am trying to get a json file from localdisk.
[18:14:09] <pm_> $.getJSON("E:\git\eclipse\raphael\proj4\WebContent\maps\US\county\USCountyMap.json", function (a) { alert(a[1][2]);});
[18:14:17] <pm_> however this is not working. I read this has something to do with cross site access and to use JSONP.. but i couldn't understand ...
[18:14:22] <RandalSchwartz> that's not goonna work
[18:14:25] <pm_> I googled but it didn't help. can some body point in right direction ?
[18:14:26] <RandalSchwartz> use / not \\
[18:14:48] <RandalSchwartz> oh - and that's not gonna work in general
[18:15:02] <RandalSchwartz> you can't use file urls with json
[18:15:15] <RandalSchwartz> you need a real webserver
[18:15:31] <pm_> ok
[18:18:23] <RandalSchwartz> but in general, windows \ are broken, and need to be replaced with /
[18:18:27] <RandalSchwartz> which work just fine
[18:18:36] <RandalSchwartz> not sure why windows chose \ for that
[18:18:56] <RandalSchwartz> maybe file:///E/git/eclipse/ ... might work
[18:19:04] <RandalSchwartz> but again, you want a real webserver
[18:21:25] <pm_> @merlyn per ur advice changed it to $.getJSON("maps/US/county/USCountyMap.json", function (a) {
[18:21:30] <pm_> it works now
[18:21:39] <RandalSchwartz> cool!
[18:34:25] <durin> does anyone know of a shadowbox/lightbox style plugin that will do a full screen width slideshow with multiple images next to each other when you bring up the box?
[18:54:55] <sunscreen> yay :) i think these web standards must be finally getting some where
[18:55:53] <sunscreen> i loaded up my project in firefox after about 1 month of pure developing in chrome and very little difference in rendering no glitches and all jquery/script code is working as expect
[18:55:57] <Liquide> is there some sort of bug that makes keyup and check for keyCode 13 not trigger properly in Firefox?
[18:57:23] <sunscreen> only thing i am finding is that in firefox the rendering is painfully s;pw
[18:57:23] <Eviltwin> Liquide: No
[18:57:27] <sunscreen> slow
[18:57:41] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: Do you have Firebug running?
[18:58:09] <sunscreen> yep
[18:58:55] <Liquide> well, its only Firefox that refuse to acknowledge the enter key though Eviltwin . . .
[18:59:33] <Eviltwin> sunscreen: Firebug makes Firefox run like 100 times slower
[18:59:42] <Eviltwin> When it's loaded
[18:59:52] <Eviltwin> Which is why you don't want it loaded on a production site
[19:00:01] <sunscreen> ye i noticed its not even so bad when its had a chance to sttle down
[19:01:00] <Liquide> well can anyone else figure out why line 3 never works in Firefox, since I am stumped now. ( http://pastebin.com/BGTTBeY6 )
[19:03:40] <fabiobik> hi guys
[19:03:50] <fabiobik> can someone test my page?
[19:03:52] <fabiobik> http://programais.com/me/
[19:04:02] <fabiobik> because some friends dont see the animation
[19:04:18] <fabiobik> the main div should go from top to bottom
[19:04:31] <fabiobik> and the "logo" should fade in
[19:05:26] <fabiobik> i dunno why
[19:05:39] <fabiobik> here on my laptop works perfect
[19:09:35] <fabiobik> anyone to test?
[19:30:50] <Milos|Netbook> How come we use { } without turning the first bit into a string, like {id: somevar}
[19:30:59] <Milos|Netbook> {'id': somevar}
[19:31:03] <Milos|Netbook> {'id': 'somestring'}
[19:33:20] <kenthree> Milos|Netbook: i'm no expert but I believe because you're creating an object and those are just members
[19:33:29] <Milos|Netbook> I see
[19:33:39] <kenthree> its not some weird associative key
[19:33:43] <Milos|Netbook> coming from a python background that just looks so weird
[19:34:00] <Milos|Netbook> in python we have dicts (dictionaries) like {'key': 'value'} as you'd expect
[19:50:20] <chee> lol
[20:31:38] <Milos|Netbook> What's the best way to construct and element with attributes and have it appended to another element with a certain id?
[20:32:57] <chrislabeard> Hey everyone I'm trying to do an accordion but I have a problem with the list is really long so I added .scrollTo() but it doesn't seem to be working -- http://smartercampaigns.com/services
[20:33:21] <chrislabeard> if you click on the first tab, then scroll to the second and click it, it takes you to the middle of the list. How can i make it go to the top
[20:35:57] <chrislabeard> any ideas?
[20:37:07] <durin> does anyone know of a shadowbox/lightbox style plugin that will do a full screen width slideshow with multiple images next to each other when you bring up the box?
[20:45:07] <igore> How do I add a .success to a custom function?
[20:45:20] <igore> or something similar?
[20:46:22] <Eviltwin> What
[20:49:38] <igore> I have a function that returns jQuery().post()
[20:49:59] <igore> When I call that function I can call .success()
[20:50:53] <igore> however, if I need to add another mediator function, I can't access .success anymore
[20:51:22] <igore> However, this problem arose due to bad programing practice.
[20:52:27] <bronson> How do I find the element I just inserted?  Right now I'm using $('#elem').append('<div>etc</div>').find('div').last();
[20:52:34] <bronson> There has GOT to be a better way...
[20:54:20] <Eviltwin> bronson: $('<div>etc</div>').appendTo('#elem')
[20:54:20] <Nicolas_> Good morning. Could anyone help me with jQuery UI - Draggable problem?
[20:54:24] <Eviltwin> That object refers to the new div
[20:55:25] <chrislabeard> how do I get the browser to scroll to a div that has been clicked?
[20:55:43] <chrislabeard> I tired the scrollTo() plugin but couldn't get it to work
[20:55:43] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: I believe .scrollTo supports it
[20:55:46] <thedeeno> Is there a reason why highlight just fades to white if I don't have the background-color specifically defined on the element?
[20:55:46] <Eviltwin> Oh
[20:55:47] <Nicolas_> My div elelment uses Draggable and the problem is that it changes size of my element.
[20:55:51] <chrislabeard> tried*
[20:56:02] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: You can use .offset() to get the position relative to the page
[20:56:09] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: Then use .animate on the scrollTop to that number
[20:56:22] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: do you have an example of that :-D
[20:56:39] <Eviltwin> Not yet
[20:57:34] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: this is for an accordion
[20:57:37] <chrislabeard> not sure if that matters
[20:59:48] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: just tried using this - http://papermashup.com/jquery-page-scrolling/
[20:59:50] <bronson> Eviltwin: yeah, that will work.  Not so enthused reversing everything in my app but it's definitely better.  thanks!
[20:59:58] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: but it still scrolls to the middle for some reason

[21:08:21] <chrislabeard> so am I going to need ids for this
[21:08:36] <Eviltwin> You don't *need* them
[21:08:57] <baldaris> hey guys , Kindda new to jquery...i am having trouble why this jquery script is not showing tabs..
[21:08:58] <baldaris> http://pastebin.com/Li8kvYRE
[21:09:06] <baldaris> used nettuts for the script
[21:10:35] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: http://jsfiddle.net/xVpTE/1/
[21:11:15] <baldaris> http://pastebin.com/SuGMTd9N
[21:11:22] <Eviltwin> bronson: I think you need a $(function(){$("#tabvanilla").tabs()});
[21:11:22] <baldaris> updated pasty
[21:13:03] <baldaris> Eviltwin:was that for me?
[21:13:13] <Eviltwin> Yeah, sorry
[21:13:16] <bronson> baldaris: gotta be.  confused the heck out of me.  :)
[21:13:56] <baldaris> bronson:sorry i am a php developer..just started learning jquery and working with it - just been 2 days
[21:14:30] <baldaris> bronson:yeah i tried that...other ids are still showing
[21:14:59] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: so i can't use $(this) with that then
[21:15:23] <thedeeno> I need to grab the inherited background-color from an element. Can I do this with the jquery API? As far as I can tell no. If not, are there any plugins that can help with this?
[21:15:32] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: Sure you can
[21:15:54] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/xVpTE/2/
[21:15:56] <Eviltwin> Doesn't usually make sense to scroll to the thing you just clicked though
[21:16:17] <thedeeno> Eviltwin: I second that
[21:16:25] <baldaris> wait , i will explain...what the code does is - it generates navigation on the fly , and it is dynamically assigning div ids corresponding to navigation item numbers...<div id="<?php echo $factor; ?>"> , factor is li number like 1 , 2 ,3...so if you click on 3 it will show 3 text box...and so on , and number of textarea to show is also stored in an array makes sence
[21:16:31] <chrislabeard> yeah I get that but when you click the accordion pane it expands with content out of the view pane
[21:16:45] <chrislabeard> so your starring at the middle of the list
[21:17:32] <thedeeno> chrislabeard: Then maybe you can fix it another way. I don't like it when site's make me scroll
[21:17:38] <thedeeno> just sayin'
[21:17:49] <chrislabeard> right thats why I want it to auto scroll
[21:18:05] <thedeeno> woops, I mean do a scroll for me
[21:18:08] <thedeeno> I don't mind scrolling
[21:18:18] <thedeeno> if I'm incontrol anyways
[21:18:43] <thedeeno> So no one's run into a 'computed style' issue before? Seems like a pretty common use-case?
[21:19:06] <Eviltwin> thedeeno: What?
[21:19:31] <thedeeno> I need to grab the inherited background-color from an element. Can I do this with jquery?
[21:19:34] <thedeeno> or do I need a plugin?
[21:19:52] <chrislabeard> thedeeno: http://jsfiddle.net/xVpTE/3/
[21:20:33] <chrislabeard> woops
[21:20:41] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin http://jsfiddle.net/xVpTE/3/
[21:20:45] <thedeeno> chrislabeard: what's wrong with that?
[21:21:03] <chrislabeard> if you click design and scroll down to click another it will send you to the middle of the one you just click
[21:21:04] <chrislabeard> ed
[21:21:13] <chrislabeard> so click design scroll down and click field & grassroots
[21:21:18] <chrislabeard> it goes to the middle
[21:21:29] <chrislabeard> or end I guess
[21:22:56] <baldaris> chrislabeard:i did see your code , i think i am somewhat similar problem..
[21:24:44] <baldaris> chrislabeard:is there something you could suggest me to get the value 20 in loop on the fly..i mean get value from a form.?
[21:25:19] <chrislabeard> I'm not really that good with jquery
[21:25:27] <chrislabeard> I can only do super basic things
[21:27:02] <baldaris> chrislabeard:lol allright..
[21:27:03] <omenar> [thedeeno] you can use https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM:window.getComputedStyle
[21:27:37] <thedeeno> omenar: sol in other browsers with that method no?
[21:28:41] <thedeeno> chrislabeard: regardless of the problem (which isn't clear to me right off the bat) it doesn't seem like accordian is a good fit for your content.
[21:28:49] <omenar> I don't know if in IE will work...but, there are fixes for that http://snipplr.com/view/13523/getcomputedstyle-for-ie/
[21:30:03] <thedeeno> omenar: interesting, I'm suprised this hasn't made it into the core by this point. Seems pretty common. Maybe I'll start a plugin for this stuff.
[21:30:15] <thedeeno> omenar: def not in there though huh?
[21:32:03] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: http://jsfiddle.net/xVpTE/5/
[21:32:46] <Eviltwin> Well damn
[21:32:47] <Eviltwin> It was working
[21:32:49] <Eviltwin> Oh, right
[21:33:17] <omenar> [thedeeno] according to the jQuery doc there are a few computed attribute that you can get (like height and width).
[21:33:23] <omenar> attributes*
[21:33:41] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: I found this but wasn't sure how to implement it - http://www.codeymcgee.com/demo/56/jQuery-accordion.html
[21:33:48] <thedeeno> apparently not background-color. Where do you see this in the docs?

[21:39:51] <thedeeno> omenar: ty
[21:40:56] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: sweet thanks
[21:41:27] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: so this just scrolls the window to the top
[21:42:28] <Eviltwin> It's a little messy because this is designed to be generic
[21:42:30] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/xVpTE/7/
[21:43:05] <Eviltwin> Probably the best/easiest solution would be to way for them to finish sliding then animate the scroll
[21:43:11] <Eviltwin> Does that work for you?
[21:44:03] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: its weird it just shoots the browser to the top - http://smartercampaigns.com/services
[21:44:08] <chrislabeard> maybe its the version of jquery I'm using
[21:44:17] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: Version 7
[21:44:20] <Eviltwin> Shouldn't do that
[21:44:48] <chrislabeard> I'm using drupal which uses old jquery
[21:45:13] <chrislabeard> usually most things work
[21:45:23] <dr0id> anyone got experience with codemirror ?

[22:13:26] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: they both work :-D
[22:13:27] <Eviltwin> Majicpanda: $("table tr:eq(2)").toggle(); ?
[22:13:34] <Eviltwin> chrislabeard: They're both different
[22:13:41] <Eviltwin> 9 waits for the slide then scrolls
[22:13:45] <Eviltwin> 10 scrolls while sliding
[22:13:46] <Majicpanda> whats the eq(2)?
[22:13:48] <Eviltwin> Play with them both
[22:13:52] <danieliser> the event also has another variable for the current step but only the id, so I only get "Second" for the second
[22:13:52] <chrislabeard> Eviltwin: k thanks man

[22:21:17] <Majicpanda> ah, i was wrapping it in .each...
[22:21:18] <danieliser> Eviltwin: ty i figured it out..
[22:21:23] <Majicpanda> is that not needed very often?
[22:21:52] <Eviltwin> Most jQuery functions have sort of an implied .each
[22:21:55] <Eviltwin> Internally
[22:23:02] <Majicpanda> ive got the same thing but its failing.

[22:49:06] <Eviltwin> What do you think "this" refers to there?
[22:49:58] <baldaris> Eviltwin:any a link clicked in #tabvanilla div?
[22:50:16] <Eviltwin> So why would $(this).attr("id") refer to the id of a div?
[22:50:21] <khmer> baldaris: you're missing a dot
[22:50:37] <Eviltwin> He's missing a semicolon, I think
[22:50:51] <khmer> yes true
[22:52:10] <baldaris> Eviltwin:so what do i need to do to get id attribute of clicked linked inside a specified div?

[22:53:17] <donCams> hello. say I have var myVar = $('#someId');
[22:53:36] <donCams> now I want to select all myVar with the class 'someClass', how would I do that?
[22:53:49] <Eviltwin> First off
[22:54:00] <Eviltwin> $("#someId") will always refer to exactly 0 or 1 elements
[22:54:09] <Eviltwin> And you should see ?.filter
[22:54:10] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[22:54:17] <donCams> i'm sorry. i mean $('.someClass1')
[22:54:31] <donCams> then I want to select all .someClass1 with someClass2
[22:54:45] <Eviltwin> All elements with someClass1 == $(".someClass1")
[22:55:06] <Eviltwin> Taking some collection of elements c and getting only the ones that have someClass2 is c.filter(".someClass2")
[22:55:08] <donCams> nevermind. i'll just assign someClass 2 to another variable. jeez
[22:55:35] <Eviltwin> Getting all elements that have class someClass1 and someClass2 is $(".someClass1.someClass2")
[22:55:44] <Eviltwin> donCams: Pretty sure what you want is .filter
[22:56:23] <donCams> thanks Eviltwin
[22:56:33] <Eviltwin> Which I linked above
[22:57:35] <donCams> i read somewhere that every $('#someId') or $('.someClass') call would create an object, that's why I'm assigning to vars. am I correct in doing this?
[22:57:57] <Eviltwin> They do generate jQuery objects
[22:58:01] <donCams> would .filter also create objects?
[22:58:07] <Eviltwin> That have elements that match the selector
[22:58:24] <Eviltwin> When you use .find or .filter or .children or .parent or .parents or .closest etc.
[22:58:28] <donCams> i don't know if I should use .filter or assign the class to a different var
[22:58:45] <Eviltwin> They all generate new jQuery objects/collections
[22:58:55] <donCams> oh... would that be bad for memory?
[22:59:13] <Eviltwin> Not terribly since they generally get garbage collected pretty fast
[22:59:19] <donCams> coz I just want a minimal hooks then select the other dom elements from that hook
[22:59:20] <Eviltwin> Saving them unnecessarily is bad for memory
[22:59:33] <Eviltwin> Generating them repeatedly instead of saving them is bad for CPU
[23:00:03] <donCams> that explained a lot
[23:00:06] <donCams> thanks :)

[23:52:28] <Jawsome> I know this is a jQuery channel. But, I was wondering if anyone quite good at CSS could tell me why these divs are ignoring the padding. http://pastebin.com/J7KXtAvv
