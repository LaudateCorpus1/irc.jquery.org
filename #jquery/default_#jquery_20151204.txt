[00:00:12] <sqlninja1> anyone use jquery and coldfusion?  I have a dynamicly populated table http://fourwaywarehouse.com/ECOFLEX/dynamic_table.cfm  searchable...  I tried to add a sum column, it sums, but stays static regardless of the state.
[00:01:08] <sqlninja1> http://pastebin.com/19t8pUv6
[00:01:28] <sqlninja1> This is my javascript... wondering what I need to be doing
[00:52:16] <pugtor> outside of jquery version does anyone have any ideas on what could cause different results from jsfiddle and different site?
[01:17:32] <aro> is there a way to prevent a draggable element from extending beyond the browser area if the browser size is changed?
[01:21:06] <Cork> aro: try setting https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-containment
[01:22:05] <Cork> https://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-refreshPositions might also be of interest
[01:24:16] <aro> what will that do?
[01:24:19] <aro> we set containment
[01:24:20] <aro> on parent
[01:24:23] <aro> but that didnt work
[01:24:27] <aro> this is using % positioning
[01:24:34] <aro> to keep a relative position on viewport resize
[01:24:57] <aro> but when the item is docked at the edge of the screen, if the window is shrunk, it moves beyond the edge of the screen
[01:31:40] <sdwrage> Hey all
[01:32:05] <sdwrage> is there a way with $('#myform').submit() to preserve which submit button I pressed?
[01:33:19] <pugtor> does jsfiddle do something funny with it's implementation of jqeury or something?
[01:34:17] <pugtor> I'm using 1-11.0 on jsfiddle. I literally copied exactly the "html" portion. I copied the literal "javascript" portion, and simply added a line to call jquery 1-11.0 in my local file and the functionality isn't the same.
[01:34:18] <Cork> sdwrage: you can bind a click handler on the button and store what button was clicked on the form element
[01:34:51] <sdwrage> Cork, hrm I am using this with jQuery confirm
[01:34:54] <Cork> sdwrage: but ya, it is a limitation in the event object that most browsers implement
[01:35:09] <sdwrage> I guess I could call the method to show it
[01:35:34] <pugtor> ahh i managed to reproduce the result, but unsure if this is it. jsfiddle uses "onLoad" by default, if I switch that to onDomready the results are the same.
[01:35:43] <Cork> sdwrage: also note the reason for this is that buttons shouldn't change what the form does
[01:36:08] <Cork> or rather submit buttons shouldn't change what the form does
[01:36:15] <sdwrage> right
[01:36:27] <Cork> sdwrage: what is it your trying to solve?
[01:36:38] <Cork> never used jquery confirm
[01:38:29] <sdwrage> basically I am branching logic on the backend as I have a separate button that does something completely different than the other submit on the page
[01:38:51] <Cork> ya, thought so
[01:38:53] <sdwrage> I would have been fine with another form but the backend is written in such a way that it needs the other data from the other form
[01:39:11] <Cork> sdwrage: simplest solution is to just bind click handlers to the buttons and set a hidden field based on it
[01:39:17] <sdwrage> either our unit tests get rewritten or I modify logic
[01:39:47] <sdwrage> right. Wait... I could have a hidden field and then change its value before the submit!
[01:39:57] <sdwrage> is that what you were getting at?
[01:40:03] <sdwrage> it could be there regardless
[01:40:17] <Cork> $('#the-form').on('click', 'button[type="submit"]', function() { $('#hidden').val(this.name); });
[01:40:38] <Cork> sdwrage: though don't forget to set autocomplete="off" on the hidden field
[01:40:53] <Cork> or what button was clicked will be resetored on page reload and things will blow up
[01:41:05] <Cork> sdwrage: also remember that you can submit a form with enter
[01:43:48] <sdwrage> Cork, is there an event for that>
[01:43:57] <Cork> no
[01:44:01] <sdwrage> well now...
[01:44:27] <sdwrage> I guess you could detect if that element is in focus and detect that key press right?
[01:44:29] <Cork> hitting enter in a form triggers the submit event
[01:44:33] <sdwrage> ah
[01:44:34] <Cork> no
[01:44:36] <sdwrage> damn
[01:44:37] <sdwrage> lol
[01:44:43] <sdwrage> so I am pretty much screwed on that
[01:44:53] <sdwrage> maybe just use a button then
[01:45:19] <sdwrage> something with no type="submit"
[01:45:26] <Cork> you could have the logic at the backend do something unless the field value is something specific
[01:45:57] <sdwrage> I mean, the worst that could happen is they submit an edit
[01:46:00] <Cork> if hidden-field-value == "alternative action" ; else <main acton>
[01:46:03] <sdwrage> which they can do with the second button
[01:46:17] <sdwrage> especially if I am setting the hidden value with a click
[01:46:43] <sdwrage> so it will just trigger normally
[01:47:02] <Cork> also why can't you use the submit event?
[01:50:07] <sdwrage> Cork, what do you mean?
[01:50:22] <sdwrage> because I have two submit buttons so far
[01:50:36] <Cork> sdwrage: submit is for the form not the buttons
[01:50:50] <sdwrage> right. for logic branching.
[01:52:37] <Cork> how i would solve this is through $('#form').on('click', 'button[type="submit"]', function() { $(this).closest('form').data('origin', this); }).on('submit', function() { $.ajax(this.action, { data: { target: $(this).data('origin').prop('name'), ... } }) });
[01:53:12] <Cork> then you can handle everything in a fairly clean fashion
[01:53:27] <Cork> and not have to worry about autocomplete
[02:06:31] <pugtor> Guys I'm killing myself trying to figure this out, I have 3 drop-downs and each one uses the drop-down before it to populate: http://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/ I can get it to where it "resets" on the changing on one, but not the other and I can get it to reset based on the other, but not the one.
[02:06:45] <naumanrafi> Hi im facing a problem in cordova for android im sending the ajax request to a server in which im getting response but when i receive a name (url) with brackets for example (Washington (NE)) i get an error net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (file://android_asset/www/washington%20(NW)) how to resolve it for the names like Washington it works fine but whenever the name has brackets it does not send request and gives an error. http://a.c.c.com/
[02:07:52] <pugtor> Basically the parent drop-down "gfs", "gfsens" has a unique (even though it might look like it's the same) set of second drop-downs. That middle drop-down has unique children (the third drop-down) values. Ultimately I need the 3rd drop-down to reset when the 2nd drop-down resets. I need the 2nd AND 3rd dropdown to reset when the parent drop-down changes.
[02:10:03] <Cork> pugtor: populateSelectregion is only called when #model is changed
[02:11:15] <Cork> pugtor: also the each loop on line 251 can be replaced with var str = jQuery("select option:selected").map(function() { return $(this).text(); }).join(' ');
[02:11:19] <pugtor> Cork: Even then, if you left the first drop-down at "GFS" and select the second drop-down of 500mb Height Anomaly and then changed the first drop-down to GFS-Ensemble, that should then make the second drop-down reset, no?
[02:11:51] <Cork> pugtor: and so it does
[02:12:04] <pugtor> It does?
[02:12:13] <pugtor> Well.. the drop-down itself does, the change event doesn't.
[02:12:33] <Cork> ah you mean the text?
[02:12:39] <pugtor> The change event is primarily what I'm concerned with since those 3 vars I'm going to use to form a url.
[02:13:12] <Cork> ok, i need to clean this up a bit to make it readable
[02:14:12] <pugtor> Thinking in reverse order (the drop-down themselves, and the vars which are the change .html) , if the first drop-down was GFS, second was 500mb Height and the third was Northern Hemisphere. If you just changed the second one to say "Synoptic 4-Panel", the GFS drop-down can stay but the other two should reset back to the default.
[02:14:57] <pugtor> So then if you were on GFS, 500mb Height, Northen Hemi and selected GFS-Ensemble all three should then be exactly what the drop-down do currently, but the .html doesn't do that.
[02:15:50] <pugtor> Honestly, the only thing that appears to not work correctly is that .html/variable output.
[02:17:17] <Cork> pugtor: you have some logic problem with this code
[02:17:28] <Cork> you bind ready handlers from inside change event handlers
[02:17:42] <pugtor> Cork: I am a noob. :-/
[02:18:06] <pugtor> The thing is the drop-downs work exactly how they should. It's that last snippet of code that prints the .html that doesn't.
[02:18:37] <naumanrafi> Hi im facing a problem in cordova for android im sending the ajax request to a server in which im getting response but when i receive a name (url) with brackets for example (Washington (NE)) i get an error net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (file://android_asset/www/washington%20(NW)) how to resolve it for the names like Washington it works fine but whenever the name has brackets it does not send request and gives an error. http://a.c.c.com/
[02:24:31] <Cork> pugtor: does this do what your looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/2/
[02:26:09] <Cork> naumanrafi: that question is offtopic here
[02:26:40] <Cork> ask in there support channel/forum
[02:28:02] <testteste> hello, I am trying to upload image to remote server using form plugin.Image gets uploaded on server but it is getting currupted and hence we can't view the same.
[02:28:44] <Cork> testteste: "plugin.Image gets"?
[02:28:54] <Cork> are you talking about a server side plugin there?
[02:31:02] <naumanrafi> yes i'm getting the error of brackets.
[02:31:25] <naumanrafi> when getting response JSON from the server.
[02:31:46] <naumanrafi> Application error: ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND ...
[02:31:51] <Cork> naumanrafi: if the problem is with the json parsing you would have to provide the json you get
[02:33:12] <Cork> naumanrafi: Application error: ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND does not sound like a json error though
[02:33:23] <Cork> it sounds like a phonegap error
[02:33:32] <Cork> and that would be off topic for this channel
[02:33:45] <naumanrafi> im getting this as JSON RESPONSE from the server
[02:33:47] <naumanrafi> {"county":"MONMOUTH (SOUTHEAST)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"MONMOUTH (SOUTHWEST)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"MORRIS","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"OCEAN (NORTH)","statename":"New Jersey"}
[02:34:20] <naumanrafi> but when i click on OCEAN (NORTH) it gives Application error : err_file_not_found on android (cordova)
[02:34:32] <Cork> naumanrafi: that isn't valid json
[02:34:45] <Cork> it repeats objects without a wrapping array
[02:35:29] <naumanrafi> [{"county":"ATLANTIC","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BERGEN (CENTRAL)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BERGEN (SOUTHEAST)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BERGEN (WEST)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BURLINGTON (EAST CENTRAL)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BURLINGTON (NORTH)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BURLINGTON (SOUTHEAST)","statename":"New Jersey"},{"county":"BURLINGTON (WEST)","statename

[02:35:46] <naumanrafi> i cannot click on bergen (central)
[02:35:51] <Cork> naumanrafi: again, this is not ontopic for this channel
[02:36:07] <Cork> you have phonegap problem take it up in there support channels
[02:36:18] <naumanrafi> can u provide me the phonegap channel ?
[02:36:22] <Cork> no
[02:36:22] <naumanrafi> as im new here.

[05:51:33] <Mark_____> im just throwing the question. does anyone know how to create anchors for slides created by fullpage.js? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[06:19:39] <km4> hu
[06:20:05] <km4> hi* anyone add clipboard to bootstram 3.3.5 ?
[06:26:12] <Duikb00t> Are there owl carousel users here?
[06:28:40] <hellyeah> hey
[06:28:41] <hellyeah> can you help me about this? When i move button onto another button i want to add these two buttons a div. Right now i can just add one of the button http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/8/
[06:31:15] <Mark_____> can anyone help me out giving the ‘title’ for each slides using fullpage.js anyone? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/project/#firstPage
[06:36:19] <km4> Mark_____: title like FirstSection SecondSection Third etc ?
[06:36:36] <Mark_____> yes exactly.. but what im thinking is
[06:36:46] <Mark_____> the title needs to show only when it is selected slider.
[06:37:00] <Mark_____> and you are refering to sections, not slides.
[06:37:09] <Mark_____> im talking about the slides.not sections.
[06:37:15] <Mark_____> they are horizontal slides.
[06:38:11] <Mark_____> i tried to do it having both css and jquery modification and still no luck.
[06:38:26] <ismithers> Hey kids
[06:38:58] <Mark_____> i want to be a kid.
[06:39:39] <Mark_____> Duikb00t:
[06:39:47] <Mark_____> are you looking for owl slider users?
[06:41:35] <ismithers> Could someone cast their eyes this a way: http://www.lentarauc.org.au/ and resize the window a bit.
[06:41:39] <ismithers> You can see the menu shrink and when the buttons don't fit on one line, they gett added to the 'More' menu.
[06:41:51] <ismithers> I wish to know ways to do that.
[06:42:33] <ismithers> I did that menu btw, but it has a flaw, in that I have to wait for the CSS to be applied before calculating the menu item sizes.
[06:43:09] <Mark_____> right.
[06:43:18] <Mark_____> it’s using css if im correct.
[06:43:25] <Mark_____> or not..
[06:43:29] <hellyeah> Mark_____: can you give some ideas :X
[06:43:38] <Mark_____> hellyeah: hmm?
[06:43:44] <Mark_____> did i say something wrong
[06:44:00] <hellyeah> no
[06:44:14] <hellyeah> i have a issue can i ask you for a suggestion :D
[06:44:30] <Mark_____> i have no idea what you mean.
[06:44:31] <ismithers> Mark_____: Yeah it is, plus jquery.
[06:44:54] <ismithers> So it creates a copy of the menu, fully styled off-screen and hidden. Then works out domensions etc, then checks screen size, and then shrinks/grows the menu as needed.
[06:44:55] <hellyeah> Mark_____: can you help me about this? When i move button onto another button i want to add these two buttons a div. Right now i can just add one of the button http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/8/
[06:45:08] <Mark_____> oh well you are askingme
[06:45:21] <Mark_____> whose knowledge is solely limited to some html5 and css3
[06:45:32] <Mark_____> and rarely extends to jquery...
[06:45:38] <ismithers> Oh sorry I thought you were asking me haha.
[06:45:40] <ismithers> Crossed wires.
[06:46:17] <Mark_____> and hellyeah  i have hard time understanding what you mean by your questions.
[06:46:19] <Mark_____> *question
[06:46:28] <Mark_____> and my english typing is failing very badly.
[06:57:40] <km4> Mark_____: you have solution ?
[06:58:08] <Mark_____> i don't..
[07:03:30] <hellyeah> Mark_____: i repeat
[07:04:01] <hellyeah> when you drag and drop button into another one. Button will be put into div you see that http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/11/
[07:04:19] <Mark_____> you wanna make it not overlap with each ohter?
[07:04:30] <hellyeah> no no
[07:04:39] <hellyeah> i want to see both button on the div
[07:04:50] <hellyeah> now i can just take one button to the div
[07:05:04] <Mark_____> hmm, man i have no idea.
[07:05:14] <hellyeah> okey no problem
[07:05:17] <hellyeah> thanks
[07:09:02] <hellyeah> anyone is good about jquery ui here
[07:09:03] <hellyeah> ?
[07:12:54] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:13:06] <Mark_____> hellyeah:  what are you building right now?
[07:13:21] <Mark_____> i’ve seen you quite a number of time right now, and feel like we are on the same stage.
[07:13:27] <Mark_____> are you building your own website?
[07:13:45] <hellyeah> actually i am buildin a screen
[07:13:55] <Mark_____> what is screen?
[07:14:01] <hellyeah> for people who observe the system
[07:14:07] <Mark_____> hmm..
[07:14:13] <hellyeah> something like inquiry application screen
[07:14:21] <Mark_____> i have no idea what that is.
[07:14:22] <Mark_____> but okay.
[07:14:23] <hellyeah> you know i work in a bank so many service online
[07:14:35] <Mark_____> oh i didnt know you work at a bank
[07:14:47] <hellyeah> and it is really important to guarantee system works smooth
[07:14:57] <Mark_____> yes.
[07:15:08] <hellyeah> so if any problem occurs i need to show that problems
[07:15:27] <hellyeah> so i just try to prepare a screen for friendly usage
[07:15:44] <hellyeah> there is so many details
[07:15:52] <hellyeah> what i try to do is "grouping"
[07:16:05] <hellyeah> think about there is 1000 button
[07:16:37] <hellyeah> you can group buttons like each group has 2 buttons so that means 500 group
[07:16:43] <hellyeah> so it make easier to access
[07:16:59] <Mark_____> hmm, i have no idea exactly what you are trying to do except grouping the buttons
[07:17:08] <Mark_____> but im sure you’ll have good luck in doing it
[07:17:22] <Mark_____> im not sure can’t be a great help though.
[07:17:23] <Mark_____> *can
[07:17:32] <hellyeah> no problem
[07:23:05] <pugtor> Cork: That works better but now the third drop-down doesn't reset at all.
[07:23:32] <Cork> wow that was a long time ago i don't even have the link any more
[07:23:58] <pugtor> https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/2/
[07:24:00] <pugtor> :)
[07:24:34] <Cork> pugtor: the third select works just fine here
[07:25:32] <hellyeah> brb
[07:26:23] <pugtor> Default load is GFS, Synoptic 4-Panel, US (Conus). If you change it to GFS, 500mb Height Anomaly and Northern Hemisphere  and then change "GFS" to "GFS-Ensemble" the only thing that changes is the 1st and 2nd drop-down. The third drop-down stays at Northern Hemisphere and the #debug shows NHEMI still too.
[07:27:38] <pugtor> BUT. if you then change that changed 2nd drop-down to anything other than Synoptic 4-Panel the third drop-down and then #debug .html changes back to US (CONUS).
[07:29:40] <pugtor> It's almost like it's a royal PITA to make chained select's difficult to work with. Like I was saying my original fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/24su4gsn/) the drop-downs worked perfect the absolute only thing that didn't work was the 3rd drop-down didn't update in the #debug .html at the same time.
[07:29:45] <pugtor> :-/
[07:30:28] <pugtor> But the third drop-down DID update all the time (like expected) it was strictly not updating in the #debug .html portion.
[07:45:25] <donnib> hi
[07:45:51] <taplar> morning
[07:46:00] <donnib> if i have a h2 element and it has a class name X, how do i select it with the selector ? :heading.x does not work
[07:46:19] <taplar> 'h2.X'
[07:46:42] <taplar> no space between
[07:47:01] <donnib> i tried that…hmmmm actually the first thing i tried
[07:47:14] <Cork> donnib: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[07:47:18] <Cork> might want to read that one
[07:47:31] <Cork> donnib: but if you know css it is the exact same engine used here
[07:47:39] <donnib> Cork: thank you
[07:48:04] <Cork> well same engine + jquery specific extensions
[07:48:07] <pugtor> Cork: Again, I'm a noob, but it almost seems like the #model .change needs to reset/update not only the #plot but also $region. The #region drop-down and #debug .html  does appear to work fine when changing the #plot drop-down all the time though.
[07:48:43] <Cork> pugtor: i don't follow what part isn't working
[07:49:04] <Cork> changing the first, second or third one changes the text
[07:49:11] <Cork> and all of them changes the ones after it
[07:49:14] <Cork> where is the problem?
[07:49:14] <taplar> i was glancing at it.  its the problem that the third select sometimes loses it's state when changing a previous select?
[07:49:22] <taplar> its = is it
[07:51:34] <taplar> actually it doesn't seem like any of them remember the previous state on rebuild
[07:51:43] <pugtor> Ok, so the default state of: https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/2/ the drop-down all match up to the text. If you change "GFS" to "ECMWF", still so far so good. If you then click the #region drop-down (3rd one) the only option is US (CONUS) when 500mb Height Anomaly contains US (CONUS) and Europe.
[07:52:49] <pugtor> It only then updates the #region (3rd drop-down) if you click a different #plot (2nd drop-down), you see Cork ?
[07:53:01] <Cork> pugtor: nope
[07:53:20] <taplar> i see more than just one option in the 3rd select when i do your first step
[07:56:31] <pugtor> Ok, default state of (https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/2/) is GFS->Synoptic 4-Panel->US (CONUS), right? If you then change GFS to ECMWF the drop-down and the text goes to ECMWF->500mb Height Anomaly->US (CONUS), right?
[07:57:16] <taplar> sure
[07:57:28] <pugtor> Now, the third drop-down only contains US (CONUS), right?
[07:57:38] <taplar> yep
[07:57:48] <pugtor> It shouldn't... because the third drop-down hasn't been updating.
[07:58:03] <pugtor> 500mb Height Anomaly contains US (CONUS) and Europe (Overview).
[07:59:04] <pugtor> BUT if you then click 500mb Height Anomaly and change that to 850mb Temperature Anomaly, the third contains US (CONUS) and Europe (Overview) and then if you change that back to 500mb Height Anomaly, the third drop-down now contains US (Conus) and Europe (Overview)... see what I mean?
[08:03:21] <taplar> i don't believe your triggering the change on the right elements
[08:03:24] <Cork> pugtor: found another problem
[08:03:40] <Cork> pugtor: the code depends on getting the text of the fields not the value
[08:03:47] <Cork> and you set val="" in the original options
[08:03:51] <Cork> not value=""
[08:04:00] <IamTrying> Hello Experts. I have a problem. My clients close there Google Chrome browser using WebSocket i can track offline. But now they close there laptop power or unplug the internet cable or wifi, in that case how can i check he is offline?
[08:04:41] <IamTrying> How can i know from server if the client closed this Laptop power of internet/wifi/3g/4g?
[08:04:54] <taplar> the websocket closes?
[08:04:57] <pugtor> Cork https://jsfiddle.net/un73ud3b/2/ - The CSS box shows the reproducable problems.
[08:05:04] <taplar> pugtor: https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/4/
[08:05:11] <taplar> is that working as you think it should?
[08:05:16] <IamTrying> taplar: WebSocket does not have closes it always need trigger from Browser no?
[08:05:29] <taplar> if you close your browser the socket would close
[08:05:50] <pugtor> taplar: Looks perfect.
[08:05:51] <IamTrying> taplar: Close browser trigger that, but when you switch off internet / wifi/power off then it does not get any
[08:06:14] <taplar> so your saying the server still has an open connection?
[08:06:32] <IamTrying> taplar: YES - it does not get any info, as a result the username: taplar is always forever online
[08:06:32] <taplar> i don't know that i buy that
[08:06:56] <taplar> what ever event your expecting may not fire, but the connection -does- close
[08:07:38] <taplar> you should have some way to check that a connection closes without an event.
[08:07:41] <Cork> pugtor: ok, so you always want to reset the selected value ontop of changing the options?
[08:07:46] <IamTrying> taplar: do you have any example or so what you are refering in your mind. cause as far as i know for webSocket you ahve to push the event to the server.
[08:07:47] <taplar> relying on the client to tell you that for clean up is unsafe
[08:08:09] <IamTrying> taplar: exactly, i do not want to rely on client.
[08:11:09] <Cork> pugtor: https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/5/
[08:11:14] <Cork> that one should work
[08:11:25] <xec> surely the server should be able to know if there is a client connected with websocket?
[08:11:28] <Cork> pugtor: i would recommend changing the model values in the data object though
[08:11:37] <Cork> xec: it does
[08:11:46] <Cork> i've implemented it my self
[08:12:21] <IamTrying> taplar: https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/353 - do you mean this?
[08:12:25] <Cork> the websocket protocol has a ping solution in the spec
[08:12:31] <Cork> it is there to detect when the other party dies
[08:12:56] <IamTrying> OK - fantastic Cork, thank you that can resolve my problem.
[08:12:56] <taplar> maybe, i'm not intimiate with WS
[08:13:08] <taplar> but just knowing socket logic, you have to be able to detect termination
[08:14:10] <Cork> pugtor: a final cleaned up solution where the data object has been fixed to use the value instead of the label as key https://jsfiddle.net/cy1L813m/6/
[08:14:17] <Cork> that one should do what you want
[08:15:14] <IamTrying> OK - no problem i will find it. Gmail does it, it automatically show internet off or on when you pull out the plug. something like Google i will implement. thanks for sharing.
[08:16:07] <Cork> IamTrying: what google does is most likely just checking for offline mode in the browser
[08:16:39] <Cork> IamTrying: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/onLine
[08:17:12] <Cork> though note that won't catch if it is lost further down the network chain
[08:20:37] <IamTrying> OK - Cork Guru, thank you, i will check it.
[08:22:37] <pugtor> Cork: I appreciate you not freaking out of me in the past 8 hours. I appreciate all that you and taplar have helped me with. =D
[08:23:01] <Cork> pugtor: no problem
[08:23:22] <Cork> pugtor: do you follow the code changes i've done?
[08:23:31] <Cork> it has changed quite a bit :)
[08:23:36] <taplar> huh?
[08:23:45] <taplar> i was supossed to freak out?
[08:23:58] <taplar> oh that was at cork
[08:24:36] <pugtor> Well, I didn't understand why the first approach used the actual text instead of the value.. option needed to be val=. I had to hack a way to get "GFS" to equal "gfs", so I added id= which you can tell by the #model :seleted .val('id') heh
[08:24:50] <pugtor> So I do like this final approach better.
[08:25:14] <Cork> pugtor: well cause val isn't a valid attribute
[08:25:30] <Cork> pugtor: so what the browser did was take the text of the option element and put that as the value
[08:25:32] <taplar> i actually had a question
[08:25:42] <taplar> what's up with the use of $.map ?
[08:25:52] <taplar> it's a single element, no?
[08:25:57] <Cork> no
[08:26:05] <Cork> it loops the data objects
[08:26:11] <Cork> and creates option elements from them
[08:26:17] <pugtor> I don't need you spending more time on this, but could you point me in the direction I can read/figure out how to "compare" the #plot's #region's? So synoptic 4-panel only contains US (CONUS), but Two-Meter Temperature contains US (CONUS), Europe (Overview) so I'd freaking love if the plot's #region was equal to the previous selections they could stay the same without resetting. HA
[08:26:31] <taplar> but it's doing dataregion[plot]
[08:26:59] <Cork> pugtor: sadly what your doing right now is the only cross browser compatible solution
[08:27:01] <taplar> ooh
[08:27:07] <pugtor> gotcha
[08:27:10] <Cork> you can't hide elements in a select element
[08:27:15] <taplar> the layout of the object is confusing me
[08:27:19] <Cork> cause webkit doens't remove the space for the hidden element
[08:27:24] <Cork> and ie straight out ignores it
[08:27:57] <Cork> pugtor: but do you understand what fixed the problem in /6/ ?
[08:28:37] <Cork> pugtor: i moved the event handler for plot to bind first, and NOT to trigger when it is bound
[08:29:02] <Cork> then i bind model and it triggers plot when it updates it, and it triggers it self as it is bound
[08:29:14] <Cork> this means that when model changes it will trigger a change in plot
[08:29:17] <Cork> solving the problem you had
[08:29:24] <IamTrying> Cork: Guru when i use this http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/navigator.onLine.html  and then switch off wifi/internet cable i can see its working. But the problem is "Cork" is offline how can "IamTrying" see Cork is offline from server? because "Cork" username offline cant be submitted to the server
[08:29:59] <pugtor> Corl I'm assuming it could somewhat be done if each #plot actually was a var? instead of just the #model and #region. Then you could use this approach? http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html
[08:30:00] <Cork> IamTrying: ah, ya if the server needs to know you need websocket
[08:30:02] <pugtor> Cork* ha
[08:30:15] <pugtor> Cork, actually forget the comparing of the drop-downs, lol. I don't need to go breaking this again. :P
[08:30:24] <IamTrying> Cork: So i have to detect it from the SERVER if connection is open or closed.
[08:30:47] <Cork> pugtor: it should be quite stable now, but you need to understand the code if you plan to use it
[08:30:54] <taplar> yup
[08:30:59] <Cork> IamTrying: ok, then websocket is your only option
[08:31:08] <IamTrying> OK - Thank you Guru.
[08:31:35] <Cork> IamTrying: note if your server runs php you will have a bad time
[08:31:39] <Cork> php hate websocket
[08:31:50] <taplar> is that even possible now?
[08:32:01] <IamTrying> Cork: I have a RAW WebSocket server connection, i am running Node server
[08:32:11] <Cork> was just about to say "it is the only server language i know of that don't support websocket yet" :D
[08:32:19] <Cork> ah
[08:32:20] <taplar> grails, nodejs, maybe some .net
[08:32:25] <IamTrying> how can i know from Node Server, if that specific user is closed? do we have a fixed event in Node server?
[08:32:37] <taplar> you should have some sort of heartbeat logic
[08:33:10] <IamTrying> websocket.on("close" << is this a pre-processing/static event?
[08:33:20] <IamTrying> or that event has to come from client to server?
[08:33:27] <taplar> that seems like an event handler
[08:33:34] <taplar> your wanting something to do with the heartbeat
[08:33:46] <taplar> which is the ping/pong WS uses for the keep alive
[08:33:58] <taplar> 'ish
[08:34:03] <IamTrying> OK - so its not the easy one. :(
[08:34:52] <Cork> IamTrying: close should be when the connection is closed
[08:35:07] <Cork> and that one happens when the connection times out (cause the ping doesn't get a response)
[08:35:24] <Cork> haven't ran websocket in node so not sure what it does there
[08:35:40] <IamTrying> OK
[08:37:01] <taplar> you know, this seems like a fairly common issue, and i'm not having alot of luck on the googs, lol
[08:41:25] <taplar> ah
[08:41:44] <taplar> If you want a real-time notification when the socket closes or experiences an error, you can use an event listener for the error or close events. The close event just means that socket is closing and the socket.readyState value is now changing to closed.
[08:42:10] <taplar> So server side you might could do a setInterval that checks the socket.readyState and if it ever closes, do your cleanup
[08:42:48] <taplar> and kill the interval of course
[08:43:28] <donnib> if i have a table inside a li and i want to make sure that when the page is loaded or resized the table fits inside this li how would i do that ?
[08:43:47] <taplar> you want it to grow with the li?
[08:43:59] <donnib> taplar: yes or scale down
[08:44:15] <taplar> sounds like a width and height of 100% thing
[08:45:01] <taplar> or some form of the other percentage based units
[08:45:10] <taplar> that's more of a #css question
[08:45:27] <donnib> taplar: hmm, maybe my problem is different coz i tried that, in my table i add divs and these divs when there are to many of them then you can’t see them or they get choped up in the li
[08:45:57] <taplar> still, you should give #css a shout out
[08:46:00] <donnib> taplar: ok, i’ll ask in css to see if somebody have an idea
[08:46:23] <pugtor> Ugh, Cork is there anything on a production site that could cause Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined?
[08:46:43] <taplar> jQuery isn't loaded yet
[08:46:45] <Cork> pugtor: $ should be jQuery in yoru case
[08:47:11] <Cork> pugtor: actually you might want to change jQuery(function() {}); to jQuery(function($) {});
[08:47:12] <pugtor> DOH! Didn't even freaking look to see if you used that. Normally the console would let me know that.
[08:47:17] <Cork> and remove all the jQuery code in there
[08:47:22] <Cork> makes the code much cleaner to use
[08:48:03] <Cork> pugtor: ya mussel memory :)
[08:48:24] <Cork> didn't think about it until you asked
[08:48:32] <pugtor> No, everyone uses $ I just never bothered to look to see how I'd tweak that so I didn't have to use jQuery all the time.
[08:48:59] <Cork> pugtor: jQuery(function($) {}); is the cleanest solution
[08:49:10] <pugtor> So is that saying everyone who uses the $ approach always wraps their code with jQuery(function($) {}); ? o.O
[08:49:12] <Cork> that makes $ == jQuery inside that redy callback
[08:49:20] <Cork> pugtor: no
[08:49:25] <pugtor> With the way everyone uses it you'd freaking thing jQuery was setup to use that by default. ha
[08:49:30] <pugtor> think*
[08:49:32] <Cork> pugtor: you have $.noConflict() somehere in your code
[08:49:38] <taplar> wordpress?
[08:49:42] <Cork> ya
[08:49:44] <Cork> most likely
[08:49:58] <pugtor> taplar: HA! For now. Going to drupal for all the json goodness soon.
[08:52:34] <Cork> pugtor: but the function wrapper is the cleanest solution
[08:52:53] <Cork> pugtor: another option is to wrap all your code in (function($) {})(jQuery);
[08:53:09] <Cork> it does the same thing except the .ready delay
[08:56:56] <hellyeah> hey
[08:57:04] <hellyeah> anyone know about jquery ui here
[08:59:43] <hellyeah> you can drag and drop button onto another button i try to add both buttons to the div but it only add one of them. Is there anything you can suggest me http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/14/
[09:14:18] <pugtor> When using: var dataforecasthour = { "gfs": [{ ... }] }; first, I'm assuming these are arrays right?
[09:15:17] <pugtor> Secondly, can you do things like var dataforecasthour = { "gfs": [{ "this_specific_item": [{ ... }] }]  }; ?
[09:19:24] <Cork> pugtor: its an object with an array of objects
[09:19:43] <Cork> pugtor: and for the second yes
[09:20:10] <Cork> pugtor: you can do { gfs: [{ this_specific_item: [{}] }]  } too
[09:20:15] <pugtor> So I can then make something happen depending on the "GFS->Synoptic 4-Panel" and I can do something different for the "GFS-Ensemble-Synoptic 4-Panel". heh
[09:20:21] <Cork> "" is only needed if you have dot or space in the name
[09:20:25] <pugtor> ahh
[09:20:40] <Cork> (or if you write json)
[09:21:27] <beasty> Cork: ! o/
[09:21:42] <Cork> ~~~\o
[09:21:57] * Cork untangles the tape
[09:30:41] <shibly> Is it possible to submit form with jquery?
[09:32:15] <jeffreylevesque> is there a way to do delegation, such that if a parent container changes (perhaps children elements get added), then detect it and do something
[09:34:19] <Cork> shibly: $('form').submit();
[09:34:34] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: not cross browsers
[09:34:49] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: there is a new observer object in modern browsers you can use
[09:35:00] <Cork> but not all browser supports them
[09:35:04] <jeffreylevesque> i usually use `.on`
[09:35:08] <jeffreylevesque> but, for forms
[09:35:12] <Cork> it isn't an event
[09:35:16] <jeffreylevesque> i need to detect if the dom structure changes
[09:35:24] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=DOM%2FMutationObserver
[09:35:34] <above> can someone tell me what im doing wrong here? inputting rock loads correctly, but not the other 2 choices i want to work, scissors and paper https://jsbin.com/gelefebego/edit?html,js,output
[09:35:37] <Cork> check the compatibility table
[09:35:55] <Cork> ie11, chrome26+ safari 7+
[09:36:34] <Cork> so if you need to support browsers that aren't the newest then there isn't a detection option
[09:37:00] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: and you will have to do by having the code changing it tell you instead
[09:38:04] <jeffreylevesque> what about `DOMSubtreeModified` in javascript
[09:38:14] <Cork> its deprecated
[09:38:24] <Cork> and not all browsers have it implemented
[09:38:31] <Cork> (and won't ever implement it)
[09:39:17] <Cork> dom modification events has performance problems and is why MutationObservers was developed
[09:42:43] <kdehl> Greetings.
[09:44:48] <shibly> Cork: What is the default method of form submitting through $('form').submit(); ?
[09:45:12] <Cork> shibly: this.submit()
[09:46:28] <alturic> Cork: Can you take a look at my PM?
[09:47:58] <shibly> Cork: GET ?
[09:48:11] <Cork> shibly: it is what ever the form states
[09:48:38] <Cork> if the form doesn't have a method attribute i think the default is post
[09:48:47] <Cork> but i'm not 100% sure on that
[09:49:18] <shibly> Cork: What does this do? https://bpaste.net/show/b2b27af559b8
[09:49:29] <Cork> shibly: nothing
[09:49:40] <Cork> this.submit() in that context is window.submit()
[09:50:03] <Cork> $('#uploadForm')[0].submit() is one option
[09:50:16] <Cork> but like i said $('#uploadForm').submit() does that
[09:50:23] <Cork> it just fires event handlers first
[09:54:36] <shibly> Cork: $('#uploadForm')[0].submit() and $('#uploadForm').submit() , are these same?
[09:54:45] <Cork> no
[09:54:54] <Cork> the first one calls .submit() on the dom element
[09:55:12] <Cork> it will make a normal form submit without calling any event handlers
[09:55:48] <Cork> the second one will trigger a submit event and fire all event handlers and if none of them aborts it, submit it
[10:06:26] <shibly> Why is $_POST empty? https://bpaste.net/show/f35c23780eb5
[10:06:36] <shibly> https://bpaste.net/show/a192363dcf36
[10:06:56] <shibly> What does this do? data:  new FormData(this)
[10:07:00] <shibly> Cork: ^?
[10:09:42] <Cork> shibly: google mdn formdata
[10:30:47] <jeffreylevesque> is there an example to detect if an element (maybe it's children) changes, if so, add a div inside it with "mutationobserver"?
[10:32:25] <lukeasrodgers> jeffreylevesque, not afaik.
[10:50:13] <taplar> if you mean changes as in mutates without a change event, iirc you'd need some form of an observer
[10:50:37] <taplar> unless you fire your logic in whatever method does the mutation
[10:52:54] <Felishia> how do I get standalone parts of jquery mobile?
[10:54:10] <Felishia> halp
[11:02:01] <sssilver> jQuery vs. Javascript vs. Java vs. Clojure -- thoughts?
[11:25:36] <jquery243> This is driving me crazy. I have a function called "getLatLong" and it's being invoked on page load for some reason... I have a click handler  $('.btn--location').click(getLatLong(address)); but the function is being called on page load instead of on click
[11:29:02] <Brodingo> jquery243 the way you have it set up that function is being called when youre trying to bind the handler
[11:37:15] <jquery243> and how would I go about fixing it? I changed it to an .on("click" getLatLong()); but it's the same
[11:37:42] <robertmaxrees> dunno what issue you're having, but that should probably be .on("click" getLatLong);
[11:37:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing that function doesn't return a function.
[11:38:35] <jquery243> yeah but I'm passing a parameter getLatLong(address)
[11:38:43] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't matter.
[11:38:54] <robertmaxrees> and actually, you should pass a parameter within your handler in the first place :)
[11:38:59] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[11:39:16] <jquery243> not got a fiddle, I'll have another go and then I'll make one if I'm confused some more :P
[11:39:25] <robertmaxrees> what was the original question?
[11:39:45] <jquery243> the function is being called on page load instead of on click. getlatLong is being invoked on page load
[11:39:49] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:39:56] <robertmaxrees> that's why - you need to pass the object, not call it.
[11:40:14] <robertmaxrees> .on("click" getLatLong); will fix that - attach a data attribute with whatever info you need and read that instead.
[11:45:03] <alturic> hey guys, in the code blocks of //new stuff (http://jsfiddle.net/v1w3718q/) is there anyway to get that to populate the #fhr div? So #fhr div would have <button id="fhrb" type="button" class="btn btn-default" value="hr000">0</button> if the GFS, Synoptic 4-Panel drop-downs were selected. There would be buttons for 0 and 6 if the Synoptic 4-Panel, GFS-Ensemble was selected though.
[11:45:43] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:46:18] <robertmaxrees> so you want to populate that div with buttons generated from that data?
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> alturic
[11:47:23] <alturic> Yes. So if the default drop-downs GFS, Synoptic 4-Panel were selected, using the example data from //new stuff, there would be the 1 button. If you were to selected GFS-Ensemble, Synoptic 4-Panel it would have the data from those 2 buttons.
[11:47:53] <robertmaxrees> GFS vs GFENS?
[11:47:58] <robertmaxrees> sure - where are you stuck?
[11:47:58] <alturic> Correct.
[11:48:10] <alturic> How do I get it to populate the buttons? ha.. :-/
[11:48:29] <alturic> I think my biggest issue right now is that I don't know how to use arrays of an array.
[11:48:48] <robertmaxrees> so lets reduce down the problem then.
[11:48:58] <alturic> At least I believe dataforecasthour is an array, containing an array.
[11:49:08] <alturic> I'm new to java. :-(
[11:49:12] <robertmaxrees> this is not java.
[11:49:15] <robertmaxrees> this is javascript.
[11:49:24] <robertmaxrees> those two things are as related as car and carpet :)
[11:49:26] <alturic> Yea, I forgot you guys don't like that. Sorry
[11:49:27] <robertmaxrees> it's actually an object whose properties are arrays.
[11:49:42] <robertmaxrees> it's not that we don't like it, it's that it's completely inaccurat.e  they ltierally have nothing to do with one another ;)
[11:50:03] <alturic> Tell that to the people who came up with the two languages. :P
[11:50:16] <alturic> But no, I do know that Java is not Javascript.
[11:50:26] <robertmaxrees> javascript's actually an implementation of a language called ECMAScript.
[11:50:27] <robertmaxrees> soooo ;)
[11:50:33] <robertmaxrees> anyway!
[11:50:36] <alturic> ha
[11:50:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/
[11:50:41] <robertmaxrees> so let's start here.
[11:50:56] <robertmaxrees> you want to generate a button based on one of those properties, right?
[11:51:40] <robertmaxrees> so start by accessing one of those properties - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/1/
[11:52:17] <alturic> Well, (please forgive me, Cork was sooooo easy on me for my completely lack of knowledge) I would say yes, BUT in that example "gfs" and "gfsens" is solely there because those are the #model's drop-down.
[11:52:25] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[11:52:30] <alturic> Okie dokie.
[11:52:35] <robertmaxrees> just reducing down.  we'll take care of that accessor part later :)
[11:53:16] <alturic> Oh crap. I didn't know you could simply access the key (forgive me again, assuming php language) by .'ing it.
[11:53:25] <robertmaxrees> it's the same as using []
[11:54:48] <robertmaxrees> is there a reason this object is formatted this way?
[11:55:23] <alturic> Yea, that's where my confusion lies. I can hard-code the accessing of the data, but I'm (looking at my pastebin) looking to have this all done based on the selectors. That's my biggest problem.
[11:55:25] <alturic> What do you mean?
[11:55:32] <alturic> I'm all for easier formatting.
[11:55:57] <robertmaxrees> why is "gfsens": [{ an array on one item?
[11:58:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/3/ would make some more stuff.
[11:58:21] <robertmaxrees> *sense
[11:59:16] <alturic> Ultimately, here's how the "real" way it would look. http://jsfiddle.net/d1uf05rw/ So it's almost like the code-base is going to be huge unless I can somehow group things.
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:59:31] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with the data format?
[11:59:47] <alturic> Well you said format, I'm assuming you meant the way the array looks.
[12:00:04] <alturic> The pastebin you just sent me is an extremely basic version of it.
[12:00:11] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle ;)
[12:00:12] <robertmaxrees> and okay.
[12:00:34] <alturic> Really, "gfs" would have 10+ keys (synoptic_4panel_), gfsens the same, etc.
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> so then back to the original - you can .forEach() through arrays and build this this way.
[12:00:44] <robertmaxrees> those aren't keys.
[12:01:02] <robertmaxrees> gfs and gfsens are both arrays with one object.
[12:01:17] <alturic> The absolute only reason I'm using the naming "gfs" and "synoptic_4panel_ is because that's what #model and #plot is. Figured that would be the way I'd want to go about changing the buttons in dataforecasthour.
[12:01:24] <alturic> Oh.
[12:01:25] <alturic> :-/
[12:01:38] <robertmaxrees> that's my whole point :) just an extra layer.
[12:01:40] <robertmaxrees> lo0l
[12:01:43] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:01:48] <alturic> Well wait... hang on.
[12:01:57] <alturic> Let me fix something for you because I see where I'm confusing you.
[12:03:53] <alturic> http://jsfiddle.net/u51t5rLL/4/ - Syntax is most likely broken but the expected output of that would be if the (on the original pastebin) "GFS" and "Synoptic 4-Panel" was selected, there would be one #fhr button, 0. If "GFS-Ensemble" and "Synoptiv 4-Panel" was selected, there would be two #fhr buttons, 0 and 6.
[12:04:12] <alturic> So, that means "gfsens" has 2 objects. "gfs" has 1, currently, right?
[12:04:35] <kdehl> Can I make something similar to the connected list Sortable in the examples on the website, where I drag an object from one list to another, but it still remains in the first list?
[12:04:58] <kdehl> So that I can drag multiple items into the second list.
[12:05:46] <robertmaxrees> back
[12:06:52] <robertmaxrees> alturic you're not payuing attention.
[12:07:14] <robertmaxrees> the "synoptic_4panel_": [{ wrapper is totally unnecessary.
[12:07:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/5/ this makes more sense.
[12:08:27] <alturic> Oh. I assumed since the gfs synoptic 4-panel COULD be different gfsens synoptic 4-panel buttons, I would need to be able to handle that. Again, my extreme lack of knowledge thought this was the easiest approach to selecting how to populate the buttons based on the #model and #plot selectors.
[12:08:54] <robertmaxrees> would either of these arrays contain anything OTHEr than synoptic_4panel_ info?
[12:09:01] <robertmaxrees> because we're not removing those names.
[12:09:16] <robertmaxrees> so that part is fine - it's the array of one object under them that doesn't make sense
[12:09:20] <alturic> Ahh but see... how do you handle if the synoptic_4panel on the "gfs" and the synoptic_4panel on the "gfsens" being different.
[12:09:31] <robertmaxrees> by accessing them through those keys...
[12:10:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/7/
[12:10:33] <alturic> That's (just making sure we're still on the same page) my whole confusion about it. the #fhr buttons are all inter-linked to the unique selections of BOTH #model drop-down and #plot drop-down. Just because the #plot drop-down contains the same thing as a different #model doesn't mean the #fhr buttons will be the same.
[12:10:51] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're jumping WAY ahead of yourself.
[12:11:26] <alturic> Well I'm talking about the end result. Again, I value peoples time so I don't want to eventually say "ahh see, this needs to be this way" and then the whole structure would change is all.
[12:11:39] <alturic> But if you're willing to teach a bit, I'm totally open. :)
[12:11:43] <robertmaxrees> that's the idea.
[12:11:48] <robertmaxrees> the point is for you to learn :)
[12:12:37] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/8/
[12:13:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaah - i see your structure now - this is just an incomplete example.
[12:13:43] <alturic> Oh totally.
[12:13:45] <robertmaxrees> there's synoptic 4 panel, two-meter temperature anomoly, etc.
[12:14:22] <robertmaxrees> right?
[12:14:24] <alturic> Exactly.
[12:14:36] <robertmaxrees> okay - a more complete data example would have helped.  let me add that.
[12:14:45] <alturic> Oh man, it would be massively long.
[12:14:51] <robertmaxrees> nah, just an example.
[12:14:54] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[12:15:06] <alturic> Oh no, I meanted if I gave you a more complete example.
[12:15:25] <robertmaxrees> right, it just needed more to convey that :)
[12:16:38] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v1w3718q/1/
[12:16:39] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[12:16:51] <alturic> So as an example, the GFS->Synoptic 4-Panel is going to have 53 buttons. 0, 6, 12... The GFS-Ensemble-Synoptic 4-Panel will be the same (but not all are like that), etc. So I can keep adding the text and value parts of course. I just needed a way to be able to select and then display the .text of the button hover like I have for the selection. Again not going to confuse you more, just listening.
[12:16:55] <robertmaxrees> so now you can just access those arrays by key.
[12:18:09] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/9/ like this
[12:19:08] <robertmaxrees> then you can do things like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/10/
[12:20:02] <alturic> Ah yes, the forEach'ing. Eventually working back to where 'synoptic_4panel_' get's dynamically selected and then .gfsens gets dynamically selected all based on the #model and #plot drop-downs.
[12:20:44] <robertmaxrees> which is easy.
[12:24:47] <robertmaxrees> something like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/11/
[12:27:22] <alturic> I think this MIGHT let me condense my code-base a lot when I work out the .change'ing of the drop-downs interacting with this.
[12:27:53] <robertmaxrees> it will.  just a minor change to your data format.
[12:28:19] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll end up having to .map() around.
[12:28:23] <robertmaxrees> err, .filter()
[12:37:40] <alturic> text and value are those intrinsic naming conventions of can something like this work: http://jsfiddle.net/e1hvkyn1/ - Top snippet.
[12:37:46] <alturic> or*
[12:38:27] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat property names.
[12:38:31] <robertmaxrees> they must be unique.
[12:38:54] <alturic> Well yea I didn't alter those values, you mean how there's two plotregiontext right?
[12:39:00] <robertmaxrees> and values.
[12:39:04] <robertmaxrees> those are not valid objects.
[12:39:05] <alturic> Right
[12:39:10] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what you're asking.
[12:39:56] <alturic> But I'm saying, that's ultimately how this whole drop-down inter-linking would work. - http://jsfiddle.net/ndokr9og/
[12:40:07] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense still.
[12:40:10] <alturic> Eh?
[12:40:13] <robertmaxrees> because that data is invalid.
[12:40:17] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what you're asking.
[12:41:02] <alturic> How so? That's akin to: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u51t5rLL/10/.
[12:41:15] <robertmaxrees> not at all - i'm not repeating property names in there.
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> what's the difference between plotregiontext and plotregiontext1?
[12:41:57] <BillCriswell> The number 1.
[12:42:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:42:10] <robertmaxrees> i feel like this is being made overly complicated.
[12:42:21] <alturic> Nothing at all? Those are just two different drop-down values. I don't want you to think I'm completely stupid, but it's just because this is all inter-linked to these drop-downs. Ha.
[12:42:31] <robertmaxrees> you're interlinking them weird.
[12:43:41] <robertmaxrees> you have a three-tiered data structure.
[12:44:29] <alturic> Well... yes and no. There's a crazy solution that would be amazing, but this is the simplest approach. So... consider "gfs" (the #model) the parent. If that drop-down ever changes, all other data needs to change. So if you change "gfs" to "gfs-ensemble" the #plot (2nd) drop-down needs to reset, because as you can see there's different #plots depending on the #model. Ontop of that, not every
[12:44:29] <alturic> #plot has the same #region (3rd drop-down) so if that changes, the #region needs to reset to the default.
[12:44:40] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[12:44:41] <alturic> yes and no was in reference to being overly complicated.
[12:45:03] <alturic> All of that from my original paste worked exactly as expected.
[12:45:06] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to help youa t this point.
[12:45:26] <alturic> Yea, that's kinda the thing, there's 4 unique things, that are all still married together.
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to nest your data.
[12:45:57] <robertmaxrees> mydata.gfs.synoptic.conus - this would make sense as an accessor.
[12:46:11] <robertmaxrees> so you nest accordingly.
[12:57:09] <estan> hm. i have two sortable lists and i'd like to wrap a child of the dragged li in <s></s> when dragged to the second list, and unwrap it when dragged back to the first: https://jsfiddle.net/4owx6mur/6/
[12:57:27] <estan> the wrapping works fine, but not the unwrapping, the <s></s> remains :/ any ideas?
[12:59:15] <alturic> robertmaxrees: This will explain exactly how it works with everything working except how to handle the button approach. http://jsfiddle.net/5ku70kf7/
[13:00:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:00:27] <robertmaxrees> i know that.
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> the explanation is too long.
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting a data format that gets you there super fast.
[13:14:26] <estan> ehm. *facepalm*. of course i can't use the same selector when i'm going to unwrap... because the element is now wrapped. so, nevermind.
[13:19:25] <hlvwrk> Is there any way to prevent jQueryUI from setting a minheight on dialogs by default?
[13:31:04] <dimi1947> remind me please...with hide()..an element is removed from the DOM...correct?
[13:31:08] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:31:24] <robertmaxrees> basically display: none; is set on it.
[13:40:51] <dimi1947> so it is just hidden...not removed from the DOM
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[13:41:38] <dimi1947> got it...thanks
[14:08:45] <estan> hm. i'm using $('#text_area').on('keyup paste', function () { .. }) to react to changes in a text area, but how can i also catch moving of text internally in the text area?
[14:09:01] <estan> e.g. selecting some text and dragging it to a different place.
[14:09:31] <estan> seems the paste event is not fired then.. so is there an event for this?
[14:09:48] <estan> (i need it for rendering a Markdown preview any time the area changes)
[14:10:03] <robertmaxrees> could probably respond to mousedown/mouseup.
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> not sure about other events though.
[14:12:06] <estan> ah, of course. mouseup should be fine.
[14:12:37] <estan> will be a little liberal, but that's okay.
[15:05:11] <ankk> hi.
[15:07:02] <ankk> i get data via ajax and i see data with alert function.. but replaceWith doesn't work... i really can't see any problem
[15:07:15] <ankk> there is a div named "dynamicForm"
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[15:07:26] <ankk> and i use and  $('#dynamicForm').replaceWith(data); in success
[15:07:27] <robertmaxrees> also: any console errors?
[15:07:29] <ankk> that's it
[15:07:34] <ankk> nope. nothing
[15:07:34] <robertmaxrees> also: what's data?
[15:07:39] <ankk> data is html
[15:07:51] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[15:07:52] <ankk> and i see full clear html via alert etc.. everywhere
[15:08:18] <ankk> i'll
[15:09:41] <ankk> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/myonetici/36b751b596cf24a1ba39
[15:09:57] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:10:05] <robertmaxrees> you do a replacewith and then an .html
[15:10:11] <ankk> haha i was trying.. :)
[15:10:21] <ankk> i was using just replacewith at first
[15:10:28] <robertmaxrees> $('#dynamicForm').html(data); won't do anything - the element won't exist any more.
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> show me the data.
[15:10:40] <ankk> data is long
[15:10:42] <ankk> but okay
[15:11:54] <ankk> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/myonetici/2a11d34a9fbe442aa94c
[15:13:36] <ankk> alert(data) shows the data.. :s
[15:13:44] <robertmaxrees> use console.log() for checking btw.
[15:13:55] <robertmaxrees> and use .html() - get rid of everything else.
[15:13:57] <robertmaxrees> what happens then?
[15:14:42] <ankk> nothing
[15:14:46] <ankk> it doesnt replace the data
[15:14:59] <ankk> and no error :s
[15:15:15] <robertmaxrees> are you inspecting to verify there's no replace happening?
[15:15:44] <robertmaxrees> because i see what you're problem is.
[15:15:51] <robertmaxrees> style="border: 1px solid #b6b6b6; margin-top: 15px; display: none;" on the form.
[15:16:11] <ankk> ahaaaaaaaaaaa
[15:16:15] <ankk> wowww
[15:16:16] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:16:24] <ankk> you are awesome :)
[15:16:37] <ankk> i don't even remember that
[15:16:41] <robertmaxrees> just gotta slow down sometimes.
[15:17:01] <ankk> :)
[15:17:20] <ankk> yeap.. it works :)
[15:17:37] <ankk> thank you
[17:57:30] <ankk> can i select an element by id if the element was loaded via jquery html function?
[17:58:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:59:38] <robertmaxrees> as long as it's the only element with that ID on the page.
[18:12:26] <ankk> robertmaxrees, you know i load a form into current page and it was using jquery validation
[18:12:44] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[18:12:44] <ankk> when i load the same page in the current page, jquery validation is working
[18:12:54] <ankk> but when i load that page via ajax, validation doesnt work
[18:13:21] <robertmaxrees> you have to initialize the validation in the .done() callback/
[18:13:40] <ankk> hmm
[18:14:25] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't run otherwise.
[18:14:38] <robertmaxrees> like, jquery validate doesn't notice you added the form and re-run.
[18:14:43] <robertmaxrees> so you need to run it when you actually need it.
[18:15:24] <ankk> got it. i'll try to make it. thank you
[20:16:29] <the_voice_> Anyone know of a workaround so that you can get the relative coordinates to an element when zoomed in on mobile
[20:17:41] <the_voice_> Situation is this.  I need to be able to detect where someone clicks in an image.  Works great until zoomed in
[20:23:21] <noahmg123> How can I compare two the elements in two jQuery Objects
[20:23:34] <robertmaxrees> noahmg123 you mean see if they're the same?
[20:23:51] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: No, see the difference.
[20:24:00] <robertmaxrees> that's a tall order.
[20:24:14] <noahmg123> I know they have 90%+ in common.
[20:24:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[20:24:34] <robertmaxrees> because there's really no comprehensive way to do that.
[20:25:03] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: Well, this might fix it, do you know how to use a css selector to find elements which do not have a class attribute?
[20:25:32] <robertmaxrees> no, but you can (and should) use filter for something like that instead.
[20:26:18] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I got it. ':not([span])
[20:26:21] <noahmg123> '
[20:26:30] <noahmg123> btw this is for my own personal local use
[20:26:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd still use .filter()
[20:27:02] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: cool. I may use it as well.
[20:27:09] <robertmaxrees> or .not()
[20:27:16] <robertmaxrees> instead of cramming things into the selector.
[20:29:20] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: well I was actually just using it to quickly find anomolies in the HTML I have.
[20:29:38] <robertmaxrees> "anomolies?
[20:29:57] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I did not write this html so there are a few inconsistencies.
[20:30:11] <robertmaxrees> like?
[20:30:19] <robertmaxrees> and why do they matter?
[20:32:10] <noahmg123> OK, I got this HTML from a friends ebook. I am extracting text from it, but the html elements are not written in a way that I can easily do this. All spans should have classes but some places where there should be one span, there are two and the second one does not have a class.
[20:33:06] <robertmaxrees> ah i vaguely remember this.
[20:33:49] <noahmg123> yeah. I've gotten a lot farther than last time. This is actually a new issue that has come up
[20:34:07] <robertmaxrees> actually it's very similar to the original problems you were having ;)
[20:35:01] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah, well I got that other part working. :) I just never ran into this because the span issue was not in the first section of the book (which I was testing on).
[20:35:21] <robertmaxrees> right, but the issue is that you need to normalize the market.
[20:35:31] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yep.
[20:35:40] <robertmaxrees> which is the real problem you should solve ;)
[20:36:24] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah. well all this HTML is good for right now is providing the data. This is all preproduction.
[20:36:50] <robertmaxrees> err, if you keep having to fight against it, then it's not "good for right now".
[20:36:51] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[20:36:52] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: btw is there an easy way to replace &nbsp; in the text of an element with a regular space (i.e. ' ')?
[20:36:56] <robertmaxrees> oooh nvm.
[20:36:59] <robertmaxrees> i see what you were saying.
[20:37:21] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: did you see my earlier message?
[20:37:23] <robertmaxrees> and sure, decode the text.
[20:38:23] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: how exactly would I go about doing that? What would be the best way?
[20:39:36] <robertmaxrees> i hate to do this to you, but have you tried searching google?
[20:40:15] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah. and "decoding text" did not bring up much.
[20:40:34] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+decode+text
[20:40:47] <robertmaxrees> "decoding text" is vague to google - needs more context from that.
[20:41:03] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURIComponent
[20:41:14] <robertmaxrees> check these in particular out - MDN is your friend.
[20:42:35] <noahmg123> Those are specificaly for URIs I am just looking to remove the &nbsp from the text of an element that does not have a URI in it.
[20:42:45] <robertmaxrees> right, you also use them for text.
[20:42:48] <robertmaxrees> i can read ;)
[20:43:09] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK. Sorry, I was confused.
[20:45:54] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK, so in the elements in my developer tools I see a &nbsp, but if I double click to edit the text it displays an actual space (or appears to). If I backspace it and then type a space with the spacebar and then click out the &nbsp is gone. Functionally, is there any difference betweeen a &nbsp and a space from the spacebar?
[20:46:23] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=nbsp
[20:46:44] <robertmaxrees> there should be an automatic definition that explains the difference at the top of the search results.
[20:46:52] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ok.
[20:47:33] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: so... functionally there is no difference it seems.
[20:47:41] <robertmaxrees> there is actually.
[20:48:07] <robertmaxrees> "...a non-breaking space (" ") [...] is a space character that prevents an automatic line break at its position."
[20:48:34] <robertmaxrees> as in, it prevents the browser from using it as the point for a newline.
[20:48:40] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ok. Does it use a different unicode number that a real space?
[20:48:44] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[20:48:49] <robertmaxrees> because it is a different character.
[20:49:03] <robertmaxrees> it is a non-breaking space, so it'd have to be a different code point.
[20:49:15] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK, but don't regular spaces already not break?
[20:49:21] <robertmaxrees> they do, actually!
[20:49:37] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: hmmmm... how so? I'm interested.
[20:50:07] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what "breaking" means?
[20:50:23] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: breaking into a new line correct?
[20:50:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:50:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/komrw2zg/
[20:50:57] <robertmaxrees> see the difference between these two?
[20:52:02] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ahh... so even when css says otherwise, it will continue?
[20:52:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[20:52:14] <robertmaxrees> becauce it's a non-breaking space.
[20:52:17] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ah ok. thx.
[20:52:30] <noahmg123> also, decodeURI does not appear to be working
[20:52:32] <robertmaxrees> now, if you need to swap it out for a normal, breaking space, you can use .replace() for that.
[20:52:47] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah I was thinking that
[20:53:00] <robertmaxrees> and you might be using decodeURI incorrectly ;)
[20:55:55] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: how would I represent the &nbsp? html().indexOf(/&nbsp;/g) return -1
[20:56:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:56:12] <robertmaxrees> aren't you trying to replace them?
[20:56:54] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I was just testing it on indexOf. Why would indexOf not see it but replace world?
[20:57:20] <noahmg123> would*
[20:58:38] <noahmg123> I ran a replace and it did not work.
[21:00:08] <robertmaxrees> so why do you think that is?
[21:01:16] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: can you rephrase that?
[21:01:24] <robertmaxrees> why do you think it wouldn't work?
[21:01:34] <robertmaxrees> trying to get you to dissect the problem and learn ;)
[21:02:01] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK. let me look.
[21:06:01] <robertmaxrees> here's a hint: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6t06yap6/
[21:06:17] <robertmaxrees> (indexOf doesn't take a regex ;) )
[21:06:31] <robertmaxrees> also, how were you changing the html?
[21:06:53] <robertmaxrees> were you just doing something like $('p').html().replace(/&nbsp;/gi, ' ') ?
[21:08:52] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: no
[21:09:06] <noahmg123> I actually can paste the line here if it is ok
[21:09:20] <robertmaxrees> as long as it's one line.
[21:09:59] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: It is
[21:10:12] <noahmg123> $('span:not([class])').eq(1).prev().html($('span:not([class])').eq(1).prev().html().replace(/&nbsp;/g, ''))
[21:10:13] <robertmaxrees> then paste it.
[21:10:18] <noahmg123> ^^^
[21:10:25] <robertmaxrees> that is so hard to read yeesh.
[21:10:38] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure you're getting the right element, there are no console errors, etc?
[21:11:04] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yep, no errors.
[21:11:20] <noahmg123> and I am getting the right element
[21:11:27] <robertmaxrees> you realize you're replacing nbsp with nothing, right?
[21:11:36] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4dcavnw2/ works.
[21:11:51] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: oh. that was a second test after replacing it with ' ' did not work.
[21:12:27] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming it's changed?
[21:12:55] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ok. wait a moment this is strange.
[21:13:05] <robertmaxrees> this is why i hate selectors like :not()
[21:13:17] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I have the right element.
[21:13:30] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change that your code is super hard to read.
[21:13:39] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: yeah. Just a moment.
[21:14:26] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: .html() returns a string without &nbsp;'s. But if I look at the elements throught the inspector I see a &nbsp.
[21:14:43] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have something else going on then.
[21:15:00] <robertmaxrees> like you're selecting a different element than the one you're selecting.
[21:15:24] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: no. even if I back down and just use the jQuery object I see it.
[21:15:35] <robertmaxrees> bummer then.
[21:16:10] <noahmg123> Yeah. $('span:not([class])').eq(1).prev() shows the &nbsp, but $('span:not([class])').eq(1).prev().html() does not.
[21:16:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual markup?
[21:17:52] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK, wait. I just remembered this is xhtml. does that change things?
[21:17:58] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[21:18:01] <robertmaxrees> still markup.
[21:18:52] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK, even when copied it the &nbsp disappears (see next message)
[21:18:54] <noahmg123> <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-Copy CharOverride-3">2:23 During that long period of time the king </span>
[21:19:07] <noahmg123> (chome automatically added the xmlns
[21:19:09] <noahmg123> )
[21:19:14] <robertmaxrees> that's obviously not the actual markup.
[21:19:21] <robertmaxrees> give me the actual source, not what chrome parsed.
[21:19:38] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: how would I give you that?
[21:19:43] <robertmaxrees> view page source.
[21:19:52] <robertmaxrees> not through the inspector.
[21:19:55] <noahmg123> OK
[21:20:03] <robertmaxrees> pop it into http://jsfiddle.net/
[21:20:28] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: chrome actually added the xmlns to my copy. it wasnt in the inspector.
[21:20:41] <robertmaxrees> then where are you getting this markup from?
[21:20:45] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up.
[21:20:55] <robertmaxrees> and you're not giving me enough to go off of.
[21:22:16] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: I know. It's confusing me too.
[21:22:43] <robertmaxrees> so normally you'd show me the actual markup that you've got on your drive or curl that into a file or something for me to see.
[21:22:52] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'm playing a guessing game.
[21:23:25] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: how do I view the actual source in chrome? Or do I have to use something else?
[21:23:44] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting this data?
[21:23:55] <robertmaxrees> is it saved in a file on your hard drive?
[21:24:04] <robertmaxrees> or is it loaded in via ajax?  or something else?
[21:24:11] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: it was, but I uploaded it to a server.
[21:24:19] <noahmg123> I am viewing it on a server.
[21:24:26] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[21:24:30] <robertmaxrees> so you have access to the actual file?
[21:24:42] <noahmg123> yes. I was about to look at it.
[21:24:44] <robertmaxrees> ... soooo maybe open up the file in an editor and share the relevant bit of markup?
[21:25:14] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: here:
[21:25:15] <noahmg123> <span class="Body-Copy CharOverride-3">2:23 During that long period of time the king&nbsp;</span>
[21:25:25] <robertmaxrees> put that in the fiddle.
[21:25:37] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ok.
[21:26:04] <robertmaxrees> (gotta get used to using it :) )
[21:26:50] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK. it is working. Let me try it on my server.
[21:33:12] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: it still did not work. Would it help if I provided a url?
[21:33:19] <robertmaxrees> it would help if you make a fiddle.
[21:33:24] <robertmaxrees> so that we could play with it.
[21:33:47] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: OK.
[21:34:05] <robertmaxrees> but if you can't replicate, then it's time to hit up fixingthesejquery.com and start learning how to debug :)
[21:34:28] <robertmaxrees> since fiddles are only valuable if you can replicate the bug.
[21:35:37] <noahmg123> robertmaxrees: ok.
[21:36:17] <robertmaxrees> and with that, good luck.  i gotta jet.
[21:39:56] <alturic> Is there anything odd about running a script in Chrome from file:/// that would make simple things like .change, .on("hover", "button" not work?
[21:40:43] <alturic> If I copy/paste working code (same jquery version being loaded) things suddenly stop working, yet on the live site, works perfectly and it's straight jQuery no other libraries.
[21:56:22] <noahmg123> alturic: possibly. just try testing on the server.
[21:57:02] <alturic> it *seems* like it might have been jquery-migrate needed on the local machine...
[22:01:25] <Mark_____> can anyone help me giving ‘titles’ to each slide in fullpage.js? this one comes closer, but im failing for some reason. http://www.scriptscoop.net/t/4c7fc93548ee/javascript-title-on-horizontal-navigation-bar-with-dots-in-fullpage-js.html
[22:13:01] <JavaLover> is there a proper way to redefine a class style attribute?
[22:13:23] <JavaLover> I want to onload change my class pixel setting...
[22:13:42] <JavaLover> or is it proper to just do $('.myclass').css();
[22:14:49] <alturic> when using if statements, I know I'm doing something wrong but I can't figure out what. I have if (condition) {$('#selector').html... but yet it seems like if the condition isn't met it just keeps the previous successfull conditonal state. Is that typical behaviour for jQuery or is it because I'm not technically "resetting" the logic.
[22:20:30] <Rantanen> JavaLover: You could try doing $( 'head' ).append( $( '<style>.myclass{...}</style>' ) );. At least back in the day that used to be way faster than $( '.myclass' ).css if you had a lot of elements of that class.
[22:21:02] <JavaLover> i kinda want to just do the agreed upon standard
[22:21:11] <JavaLover> is that what you would do Rantanen?
[22:21:49] <Rantanen> alturic: That makes no sense. As in. Your question makes no sense. You might have better luck getting answers if you linked to some example code.
[22:22:11] <JavaLover> also i'm doing this on resize of browser, so will it reach?
[22:22:11] <Rantanen> JavaLover: It's JavaScript. We don't do agreed upon standards. ;)
[22:22:16] <alturic> So if I'm understanding conditionals right, in this http://jsfiddle.net/aLs3ewkL/, #fhr (all the buttons) should only populate if the first drop-down is "GFS" -AND- the second drop-down is Synoptic 4-Panel or Two-Meter Temperature Anomaly. Yet I'm not "resetting" the evaluation or something since the previous #fhr remains regardless of whether or not there's a condition for the #fhr population.
[22:22:37] <JavaLover> but lets help alturic first as I have my method working and can try yours as well :D
[22:22:39] <Rantanen> JavaLover: I would do whatever it takes. If it was just a handful of elements, I'd use $('.myclass').css
[22:22:51] <JavaLover> well those elements might be like 100...
[22:23:36] <Rantanen> JavaLover: It's all about performance. $().css is the "neater" way. But given browsers need to iterate the elements and set the styles on each element, it's slower.
[22:24:33] <JavaLover> hmm okay imma try your method now just to see
[22:24:35] <Rantanen> With append( $('<style>') ) you can delegate a lot of that element iteration to the browser internals, which usually are really fast(tm). But at the same time you need to be careful you track all the dynamically created <style> elements and clean/reuse them as required.
[22:24:38] <JavaLover> because speed is what i'm all about.
[22:25:20] <JavaLover> but if i append...that's gonna fill up that style area fast
[22:25:37] <JavaLover> guess I should remove first?
[22:25:49] <Rantanen> Back when I used the append(style), my use case was a table-like structure which contained up to 500 rows (thus, I had to touch 500 elements) and the size was changed by mouse dragging, so there were several new sizes per second.
[22:26:16] <Rantanen> JavaLover: You might be able to create a dedicated <style> element and use .text() to re-define it's content. Not sure if that works in browsers though.
[22:26:17] <JavaLover> mmm well if your testing led you to this solution it's probably best then
[22:26:38] <alturic> I know the actual if statements "work" just because if I explicitly set a if statement for the "500mb Height Anomaly" selector it uses the population from that one as seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/
[22:26:52] <JavaLover> but again lets help alturic as his question boggles my mind haha
[22:26:59] <Rantanen> Mind you, this was 6 or so years ago. Browsers have changed a lot and JavaScript is a lot faster these days.
[22:27:19] <JavaLover> yeah but the plugins I used were so ridiculously slow I decided to code my own.
[22:27:38] <JavaLover> turns out it's a lot easier than they were making it.  But yes very similar to what you did with table :D
[22:27:56] <alturic> JavaLover me too. and it hurts more for me since I know next to nothing with js. Ultimately I'm just looking to make #fhr (the button) show nothing if they don't meet the condition.
[22:28:17] <JavaLover> css('display','none'); ?
[22:28:20] <alturic> The way it stands, if they don't meet the condition they retain the previous state.
[22:29:31] <JavaLover> ok alturic i'll check your fiddle
[22:30:00] <JavaLover> did fiddle change?
[22:30:04] <JavaLover> or are you using a different fiddle?
[22:30:37] <alturic> http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/
[22:30:45] <JavaLover> no i mean the layout
[22:30:48] <JavaLover> is this a recent update?
[22:30:58] <JavaLover> cuz if so I really like the new layout
[22:31:12] <alturic> o
[22:31:13] <alturic> lol
[22:31:16] <Rantanen> alturic: What's the issue? Please describe what I should do and what SHOULD happen?
[22:31:54] <Rantanen> alturic: As far as I see, the code works correctly, but I've got a feeling you've misunderstood what it should do as it's written.
[22:32:47] <JavaLover> i'm just loving the new layout for fiddle, this is very pretty
[22:33:08] <alturic> Rantanen #fhr (the buttons) should populate based on the if condition (the only way I know how to do this, and it does seem to work, just redundant code) but IF the first drop-down #model is GFS -AND- #plot (the second drop-down) is equal to synoptic_4panel_ -OR- 2m_temperature_anomaly_  populate #fhr with those buttons. That works.
[22:33:39] <alturic> But, if you select a #plot (again, second drop-down) it retains the previous state even though it (assuming here) isn't meeting a codition?
[22:33:42] <alturic> condition*
[22:33:59] <Rantanen> So essentially...
[22:34:21] <alturic> I was under the impression IF the condition was met, do this. IF the condition isn't met, do this which is nothing.
[22:34:24] <JavaLover> http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/#&togetherjs=iB8QwwzLLi
[22:34:37] <Rantanen> If I select "GFS" in first drop down and "500mb height anomaly" in the second, the buttons should disappear?
[22:35:14] <alturic> Well, since there is no condition met, I was under the impression that would happen, no?
[22:35:36] <Rantanen> alturic: No condition met doesn't mean "stuff disappears"
[22:35:39] <JavaLover> wow that's awesome
[22:35:42] <Rantanen> The buttons are still there, so it means "do nothing"
[22:35:47] <JavaLover> thx for helping me test that hope you guys can fix this issue :D
[22:35:51] <Rantanen> ie. "leave the buttons as they are"
[22:36:13] <alturic> GOTCHA! That's what I was obviously experiencing.
[22:36:38] <alturic> I know having to use if statements for these is going to be the worst possible way of doing it, but for a noob like me it's the easiest approach. :-/
[22:37:17] <alturic> So then then } elseif { } being blank is that same behaviour? Leave the state alone?
[22:37:48] <alturic> I guess that's where you would need to specify and elseif condition not met do this.
[22:37:58] <Rantanen> else{} does nothing. You could just as well leave it empty.
[22:38:19] <Rantanen> Essentially what you want to do is put "else { jQuery( '#fhr' ).empty(); }" there
[22:38:28] <Rantanen> So if none of the if-clauses match, then clear the buttons.
[22:39:05] <Rantanen> (note, "else if" requires a condition too. "else" doesn't)
[22:39:10] <alturic> That condition of if(model === "gfs" && plotsel == 'synoptic_4panel_' || plotsel == '2m_temperature_anomaly_' ) is correct, right? I'm still a little unsure on the whole == and ===
[22:39:20] <alturic> err yea that was a typo on my part.
[22:39:43] <Rantanen> if( plotsel == 'synoptic' ) { ... } else if( plotsel == '500mb' ) { ... } else { jQuery( '#fhr' ).clear(); }
[22:39:49] <Rantanen> .. or is it .empty()?
[22:40:38] <Rantanen> Think it should be okay. Weirdly enough.
[22:41:22] <alturic> So then if(model === "gfs" && plotsel == 'synoptic_4panel_')  and   if(plotsel == 'synoptic_4panel')  the latter seems to take priority, is that because it's after the 2-part condition or just because it's the last if statement?
[22:41:53] <Rantanen> You need to consider those by line.
[22:42:24] <Rantanen> The browser/computer/javascript engine/the imp living under your keyboard evaluates each statement in order.
[22:42:54] <Rantanen> First it checks the "if model == gfs, plotsel == synoptic_4panel_". Figures that condition matches, and proceeds to run the commands inside that
[22:43:10] <alturic> Correct.
[22:43:23] <Rantanen> Once it's done with those, it continues to the next if statement. Now since it's an "if" instead of "else if", it's going to check the condition independent of the first one.
[22:43:27] <alturic> Gotcha.
[22:43:36] <Rantanen> And again figure that the condition matches.
[22:43:50] <Rantanen> And proceed to execute that one (which may, or may not, overwrite everything that was done previously)
[22:44:10] <alturic> Ahh, so if I did elseif once one matches it stops.
[22:44:11] <alturic> ?
[22:44:16] <Rantanen> Yeah
[22:44:29] <alturic> Perfect. I think. ha
[22:46:38] <alturic> And you can just keep chaining the condition to get hyper-specific... so: if(model === "gfs" || model === "gfsens" && plotsel == 'synoptic_4panel_' || plotsel == '2m_temperature_anomaly_' && region === "conus" ) would match gfs/gfsens->synoptic/2m_temp->conus?
[22:48:13] <Rantanen> That would match: "model = gfs" or "model = gfsens and plotsel = 4panel"
[22:48:47] <Rantanen> ie. "model = gfs" would match always, no matter what the rest of them are.
[22:48:58] <Rantanen> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence
[22:49:14] <Rantanen> When mixing && and || it's way less confusing to group them with ()
[22:49:52] <Rantanen> ie. if( ( model === 'gfs' || model === 'gfsens' ) && ( plotsel === 'synoptic_4panel_' || plotsel === '2m_temperature_anomaly_' ) && region === 'conus' )
[22:49:54] <alturic> I think that's what I'm looking to do because I don't want it to match ALL plotsel's under the model "gfs". I only want it to match those 2 plotsel.
[22:50:08] <alturic> Ahh!
[22:50:31] <Rantanen> Because otherwise, thanks to the defined operator precedence, that would be grouped as ...
[22:51:05] <Rantanen> model === 'gfs' || ( model === 'gfsens' && plotsel === 'synoptic_4panel_' ) || ( plotsel === '2m_temperatore_anomaly_' && region === 'conus' )
[22:51:13] <Rantanen> Which is probably what you don't want. :)
[22:52:07] <Rantanen> Although without knowing anything... what are the buttons?
[22:52:21] <Rantanen> Because such if-clauses are usually horrible to read/maintain.
[22:52:24] <alturic> They change the image attr's.
[22:52:52] <alturic> Oh yea, this whole thing is insane because the drop-downs and the buttons are all linked to each other.
[22:53:02] <Rantanen> How weird rules do you need for those?
[22:53:12] <alturic> And while it SEEMS like some of them contain duplicates (they do) they don't share anything on common on the #fhr level.
[22:53:30] <Rantanen> But they do on the plot level?
[22:54:01] <alturic> They do if the plotlevel is on the model level. :P Confusing I know.
[22:55:56] <alturic> Here's exactly how it works: http://jsfiddle.net/5ku70kf7/
[22:56:39] <Rantanen> And the buttons are always every-6?
[22:56:47] <alturic> That was from an earlier attempt at doing it better/easier but the explanation is spot-on.
[22:58:00] <alturic> The GFS is every-6 out to 240 and then goes to 384 at every 12 on the majority of #plots. The GFS-Ens is every 6 all the way out to 384 on the majority of #plots. The ECMWF and ECMWF-Ens are the only two that ARE almost identical but those only go out to 240 at 24 hour increments. :P
[22:58:21] <Rantanen> Heh :)
[22:59:07] <JavaLover> Rantanen so I found something kinda cool
[22:59:13] <JavaLover> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4232557/jquery-css-write-into-the-style-tag
[22:59:18] <alturic> But the real pita about all of it (and the thing that confuses the hell out of the majority of people looking at this) is the fact that I say each drop-down is married while yet still being independant.
[22:59:21] <JavaLover> i'm using that crazy function and it's pretty fast
[22:59:44] <alturic> Because to the noob, that's exactly how it seems to function.
[23:00:03] <alturic> by "seems to function" I obviously mean, how it needs to work. heh
[23:00:18] <Rantanen> alturic: Ya
[23:01:24] <alturic> So my last question your example: if( ( model === 'gfs' || model === 'gfsens' ) && ( plotsel === 'synoptic_4panel_' || plotsel === '2m_temperature_anomaly_' ) && region === 'conus' )   that would ONLY match the CONUS region of the 2m_temp_anomaly -OR- synoptic_4panel of the gfs -OR- gfsens model? Nothing else will match that, correct?
[23:03:42] <JavaLover> damn it's flawed though
[23:03:51] <JavaLover> it's totally filling my page up with style attributes
[23:04:05] <JavaLover> *sigh* was close, nice to see everything resizing though lol
[23:05:25] <Rantanen> alturic: Oh that's what you needed? Sorry. I figured you meant it the other way around. Then you need to reserve the parentheses.
[23:05:28] <Rantanen> .. I think?
[23:05:55] <alturic> Well hold on... your example would then do what?
[23:06:37] <Rantanen> My example would match as long as: Model is either 'gfs' or 'gfsens', AND plotsel is either 'synoptic_4panel_' or '2m_temperature_anomaly_', AND region must be 'conus'
[23:07:02] <alturic> I assumed it would have been read "IF the model is GFS -or- GFSENS -AND- the plotsel is synoptic_4panel -or- 2m_temperature_anomaly -AND- the region is CONUS".
[23:07:47] <cooldman224> noob question: why can't i get the html string from html() but instead from [0].outerHTML? see: http://pastebin.com/tG1zdKES $('<img>') works with html() ...
[23:08:20] <Rantanen> cooldman224: html() returns innerHTML
[23:10:20] <cooldman224> Rantanen: so why does the $('<img>') return outer html? with html()
[23:11:36] <alturic> Either way Rantanen here's what it does: http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/4/ - Now, I know you said using else could overwrite previous matches but your example used else so I assumed it would work as expected.
[23:14:37] <Rantanen> Did I say using else would overwrite previous matches? If I said that was a mistake.
[23:15:58] <alturic> Well you said: if( plotsel == 'synoptic' ) { ... } else if( plotsel == '500mb' ) { ... } else { jQuery( '#fhr' ).clear(); }   which I assumed meant IF (match this) else clear #fhr.
[23:16:33] <alturic> In the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/6/ I'm doing your last working (grouping) of the conditions and then I put the else .clear and now no buttons populate. :P
[23:16:52] <cooldman224> Rantanen: if I use wrap('<span>') and get the parent() with html() it works
[23:16:59] <cooldman224> but only on button. why button
[23:17:22] <alturic> But yea, that's basically what I'm looking to do, if the condition matches, stop otherwise keep proceeding trying to match until you hit the else .clear.
[23:17:47] <Rantanen> cooldman224: fiddle please
[23:18:02] <alturic> It makes no sense that it doesn't work that way because why would you want to match something just to keep proceeding and eventually clear it?
[23:18:31] <alturic> I don't mean that towards you, I mean that towards the js if statements heh
[23:19:10] <Rantanen> alturic: Your plotsel conditions are wrong I think.
[23:19:32] <Rantanen> It's been ages since I last poked jquery seriously, but I think the jQuery( '#plot :selected' ).val() returns html elements instead of strings.
[23:20:04] <Rantanen> Which makes your comparisons:
[23:20:06] <alturic> Eh? Everything works fine in terms of actually populating on them. So if (plotsel === 'synoptic_4panel_') matches it.
[23:20:14] <Rantanen> <string> === <html element> which will always be false.
[23:20:27] <Rantanen> Oh
[23:20:28] <Rantanen> Okay
[23:20:51] <Rantanen> If I try your last fiddle, I get no buttons ever
[23:21:30] <alturic> Right, that's my point. Because of that else { .empty }
[23:21:38] <Rantanen> No
[23:21:41] <Rantanen> Because your region is not set
[23:21:53] <Rantanen> You have region === 'conus'
[23:21:57] <Rantanen> But region is never read
[23:22:12] <alturic> DERP!
[23:22:16] <Rantanen> Even if you remove the else { .empty } nothing happens
[23:22:18] <alturic> See, now why wouldn't that throw an error?
[23:23:34] <Rantanen> Because you're not running JavaScript in strict mode.
[23:24:20] <Rantanen> Without strict mode it behaves the same it did 10 years ago when it comes to undefined variables. ie. it considers their value "undefined" instead of raising error
[23:24:32] <Rantanen> Type "use strict"; at the very top of that JavaScript code
[23:24:36] <Rantanen> Then it'll throw errors.
[23:24:45] <Rantanen> And do include the quotation
[23:24:50] <alturic> HA! Fixed. Now (I swear this is the last question!) if you select GFS->Two-Meter Temperature Anomaly that contains 2 regions. CONUS and EUROPE. Any idea why it's not emptying #fhr when you select Europe? updated to working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/9/
[23:24:54] <Rantanen> ie. Line 1 should read
[23:24:55] <Rantanen> "use strict";
[23:25:19] <alturic> It does clear perfectly when selecting a non-matched plot or model though. :)
[23:25:36] <Rantanen> Because your code is in the #plot.change handler and is executed only when the #plot element value changes.
[23:25:43] <Rantanen> I'd recommend pulling it to its own function
[23:25:59] <Rantanen> var updatePlots = function() { ... };
[23:26:06] <Rantanen> And then call that from all the .change() handlers
[23:26:16] <Rantanen> (or function updatePlots() { ... }, whichever syntax you prefer)
[23:27:57] <alturic> Honestly, all that .change stuff is way the hell over my head. I guess one of the reasons I attempted learning js/jqeury is because of all these "live" sites so I went into all of this thinking that it somehow always listens (and updates) changes. It's almost like I want a listener to listen for #model to change. One to listen for #plot to change, etc. It seems like (possibly my horrible hack
[23:27:57] <alturic> of code) you need tons of explicit listeners.
[23:28:03] <cooldman224> Rantanen: http://pastebin.com/bb6ZPMFx makes sense because the <button> is the inner HTML. Looked into it more, seems to be the more elegant way as well
[23:28:59] <alturic> So when you said "then you call that from all the .change() handlers" do you mean that as "ALL" those are needed or can you actually do what I'm saying? Have one actual listener that waits for #model to .change and you can just re-use that.
[23:29:14] <Rantanen> alturic: Give me a moment.
[23:29:42] <alturic> I think your var updatePlots = function() would do just that? Be the main listener for #plots to change, right?
[23:31:37] <cooldman224> alturic: haven't been following closely but are you doing chained selects?
[23:32:40] <alturic> I'm going to say yes, and that yes is inherent on "chained" meaning the literal definition of "chain". Each drop-down is affected by the previous drop-down changing.
[23:33:41] <alturic> So when you go from say GFS->500mb Height Anomaly->Northern Hemisphere to GFS->Two-Meter Temperature Anomaly the #region (third drop-down) needs to update since there is no Northen Hemisphere #region. That stuff all works, heh.
[23:33:44] <alturic> Thankfully.
[23:34:02] <cooldman224> thre's a plugin for that :) but you can do it manually if you are trying to learn
[23:35:21] <Rantanen> alturic: http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/10/
[23:40:10] <Rantanen> alturic: http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/11/
[23:40:14] <Rantanen> And please use something like that? :)
[23:41:03] <Rantanen> ie. Generate the buttons on the fly instead of having a 3400 characters long line of code. :)
[23:42:07] <alturic> ...
[23:42:12] <alturic> oh.
[23:42:15] <alturic> my.
[23:43:30] <alturic> I'm speechless. Really, I am.
[23:44:36] <alturic> HAHAH! You want to know what my next problem is going to be?
[23:45:17] <Rantanen> Go ahead. :)
[23:45:31] <alturic> So, the actual hr format is hrXXX, so hr000, hr006, hr012 ... hr096, hr102, hr108.
[23:46:16] <Rantanen> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10073699/pad-a-number-with-leading-zeros-in-javascript
[23:46:26] <Rantanen> Just copy any lpadding function from there. :)
[23:46:45] <alturic> Also, using this nice approach, how do I make the first number be hr000 instead of hr6 currently?
[23:46:49] <Rantanen> Not sure if JS got one in the recent versions - but if you need to support any older browser, go for a custom one.
[23:47:11] <Rantanen> Is it hr000 with text 6 or is it hr000 with text 0?
[23:47:12] <alturic> I mean it might be hr006 sometimes, but othertimes it's hr000...
[23:47:16] <alturic> I told you, confusing as hell.
[23:47:40] <alturic> So example, synoptic_4panel starts at hr006. two-meter_temp starts at hr000. :-/
[23:47:46] <Rantanen> See the "generateButtonRange" function? Add one parameter to its beginning. So the paramter list is "start, amount, step"
[23:48:14] <Rantanen> And in the "range.push" line, replace the "i + 1" with "i + start"
[23:48:18] <Rantanen> Er no
[23:48:18] <Rantanen> Sorry
[23:48:20] <Rantanen> Urh.
[23:48:26] <Rantanen> Change it to
[23:48:29] <Rantanen> "start + i * step"
[23:49:56] <alturic> range.push( start + i * step ); ?
[23:50:10] <Rantanen> Ya
[23:50:18] <alturic> I get 6 NaNs.
[23:50:35] <Rantanen> urh. The invocations need to be changed too
[23:50:50] <Rantanen> ie, the lines below with generateButtonRange( 40, 6 ) or something. Into ( 6, 40, 6 )
[23:50:53] <Rantanen> http://jsfiddle.net/nfdbkxq7/12/
[23:50:55] <alturic> I totally sorry to drag you into all this. :-/
[23:51:21] <alturic> omg perfect
[23:51:48] <Evidlo> I'm trying to move an element to one place on click, and move it back when clicked again.  Is this headed in the right direction? https://dpaste.de/PrEL
[23:52:58] <Rantanen> And now with that you can even do the "First 8 go every 6 hours from 6 to 48 and the next 10 go every 24 hours from 72 to .. uh.. 312?"
[23:53:07] <alturic> Mhm.
[23:53:20] <Rantanen> generateButtonRange( 6, 8, 6 ) + generateButtonRange( 72, 10, 24 )
[23:53:59] <Rantanen> .. assuming I got the numbers right :p
