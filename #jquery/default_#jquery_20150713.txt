[00:00:00] <hellyeah> can you check my code works on your side or not with chrome if you dont mind
[00:00:29] <tw2113> sure
[00:01:14] <hellyeah> btw
[00:01:29] <soee> hi, how can i initialize this plugin https://github.com/abpetkov/powerange on content elements loaded with ajax ?
[00:01:33] <hellyeah> i am newbie my jquery, js or css may not be so good
[00:01:46] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/63/
[00:03:04] <tw2113> hellyeah, what's this supposed to do? so I know how to tell if/when it fails
[00:03:22] <hellyeah> sure
[00:03:23] <Kartagis> *sigh*
[00:03:24] <hellyeah> sÄ±orry
[00:04:37] <hellyeah> you can click not active button you will get pop up boxes when you click image button you will get another boxes. Also when you click green,orange, blue or gray and click not active button you will see corresponding row is animated.
[00:04:48] <hellyeah> Kartagis:  is there something wrong?
[00:05:09] <Kartagis> no no, just move on
[00:05:52] <hellyeah> Kartagis:  i supposed you dont like me i feel sorry if it is the case.
[00:06:36] <tw2113> not seeing anything in the console, so that's good
[00:06:42] <hellyeah> okey
[00:07:01] <hellyeah> what was the version of browser? May i ask?
[00:07:12] <hellyeah> all of them are up to date?
[00:07:18] <tw2113> 43.0.2357.132
[00:07:28] <tw2113> yes uptodate
[00:07:46] <tw2113> no console errors doesn't mean it's bug free
[00:07:53] <tw2113> it just means nothing's getting logged or shows up there.
[00:08:34] <kokut> Hello, is there a way to remove the delay of $(window).load() ?
[00:08:43] <hellyeah> well may be i should use 'use strict' in the first line of js
[00:08:58] <tw2113> i've heard good things about that one
[00:11:09] <Cork> kokut: the delay?
[00:11:23] <inthl> can one *please* waste 2 minutes for me and try to get that 'With Optgroups' example running? http://wenzhixin.net.cn/p/multiple-select/docs/#with-optgroups ... I have been wasting here 2 hours by now to try this, every other example seems to work, but as soon as I invoke an optgroup with <select ..> it fails, nothing happens. I am so much positive that I am doing it right
[00:11:27] <Cork> kokut: you most likely want to use .ready if you want to to run early
[00:11:50] <kokut> Cork: yea i switched to document.ready and its much faster now :)
[00:12:11] <Cork> kokut: there isn't a delay in .load, it just waits until everything is loaded
[00:12:15] <kokut> btw u know how to use $ instead of jQuery in 1.x ?
[00:12:17] <Cork> including external sources
[00:12:22] <inthl> a simple fiddle or something, just to demonstrate that it does work, I am unable to recreate it even by copy-paste from that site, and as mentioned: other examples do work. that library turned off, the browser shows a regular <select> with optgroups, so at least the syntax is correct
[00:12:31] <inthl> Now that's either a bug in that lib or I am nuts
[00:12:44] <Cork> kokut: you just use it, unless something is calling $.noConflict()
[00:14:06] <hellyeah> tw2113:  how can i detect my code has any bugs you know js interpratation tool doesnt complain for every possible error. I am now sure calling like that is correct.
[00:14:57] <kokut> Cork: okay
[00:15:58] <tw2113> could someone else help hellyeah? His issue is over my head for knowledge :D
[00:16:06] <tw2113> nothing you did purposely hellyeah
[00:17:25] <hellyeah> tw2113:  sorry
[00:17:28] <hellyeah> thanks anyway
[00:22:34] <inthl> hah, got it! there is a bug in the software
[00:35:18] <Chulbul> which is the best video player plugin in jquery
[00:39:26] <prohobo> Chulbul: OVP
[00:39:32] <prohobo> but ive never actually used one
[00:40:37] <hellyeah> hey
[00:41:21] <hellyeah> i understand like i can use document.on like onClick function but that doesnt work here can you help me to figure that out https://jsfiddle.net/3f984zn8/1/
[00:43:37] <hellyeah> humm
[00:43:37] <prohobo> hellyeah: buttons don't have a "change" state
[00:43:42] <prohobo> err event
[00:43:46] <prohobo> unless
[00:44:04] <hellyeah> yes
[00:44:06] <hellyeah> click
[00:44:12] <hellyeah> checkbox have change event
[00:44:17] <hellyeah> button has click event
[00:44:18] <prohobo> yep
[00:44:32] <hellyeah> asame thing?
[00:44:35] <hellyeah> same*
[00:44:36] <prohobo> oh
[00:44:38] <prohobo> document on change
[00:44:56] <prohobo> okay
[00:45:03] <prohobo> so the problem here is that document just doesn't change
[00:45:59] <hellyeah> it seems it worked now
[00:46:00] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/3f984zn8/4/
[00:46:45] <prohobo> no
[00:46:53] <prohobo> if you want a button click event handler
[00:46:59] <prohobo> attach it to the BUTTON not the document
[00:47:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:47:08] <prohobo> notice if you click ANYWHERE the handler will go off
[00:47:09] <hellyeah> onClick
[00:47:16] <hellyeah> instead of document.on
[00:47:21] <prohobo> no
[00:47:30] <prohobo> think about what you're attaching the .on to
[00:48:57] <hellyeah> am i attaching click event to the document?
[00:49:03] <prohobo> yes
[00:49:55] <hellyeah> ah so click event is related with button not with document?
[00:50:13] <prohobo> click event can be attached to any DOM element
[00:50:30] <hellyeah> not to document itself?
[00:50:43] <prohobo> as you can see, clicking on the document works
[00:51:01] <prohobo> but i doubt you want the BUTTON HANDLER to go off when you CLICK OUTSIDE THE BUTTON
[00:52:10] <hellyeah> yes
[00:52:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:52:17] <hellyeah> ic
[00:52:39] <hellyeah> yes you are right
[00:52:43] <hellyeah> ic the point now
[00:52:49] <hellyeah> this is kind of annoying
[00:54:12] <hellyeah> so
[00:54:24] <hellyeah> what is the case of using document.on than
[00:54:25] <hellyeah> ?
[00:54:39] <prohobo> document is just the entire page
[00:55:00] <prohobo> so whenever something happens anywhere on the page the document.on handler will be called
[00:55:42] <hellyeah> so it is default?
[00:56:12] <hellyeah> okey i
[00:56:20] <hellyeah> i will fix that right away
[00:56:29] <hellyeah> let me do smt
[00:56:31] <Cork> hellyeah: everything in the page is nested below window > document > *
[00:56:47] <Cork> so if you click anything you will always click those two elements
[00:56:53] <hellyeah> so hmm ii suppose document is the roort element
[00:57:00] <hellyeah> ic
[00:57:01] <Cork> yes
[00:57:30] <hellyeah> can we say document is child node of window
[00:57:44] <Cork> eh.. kinda
[00:57:50] <Cork> window and document is special elements
[00:58:03] <hellyeah> humm what do you mean "kinda
[00:58:03] <hellyeah> "
[00:58:04] <Cork> they kinda match the normal hierarchy but not really
[00:58:14] <hellyeah> ic
[00:58:17] <Cork> they are legacy elements, they where created before dom1
[00:58:33] <Cork> so they are parents to the page, but not only -_-'
[00:58:34] <hellyeah> so window is not in the data structure document has its own tree structure?
[00:58:42] <Cork> its merky :)
[00:58:51] <prohobo> window is what's currently visible
[00:58:55] <Cork> hellyeah: window is the element everything is inside
[00:59:03] <hellyeah> what does merky mean?
[00:59:05] <Cork> if you create a global variable
[00:59:06] <prohobo> murky*
[00:59:10] <Cork> ah
[00:59:12] <Cork> ya
[00:59:20] <hellyeah> so not obvious
[00:59:22] <hellyeah> ?
[00:59:27] <prohobo> ye
[00:59:27] <Cork> anyway if you create a global js variable it will be window.variableName
[00:59:30] <hellyeah> ic
[00:59:42] <Cork> and all kinda of weird legacy hacks there
[00:59:47] <hellyeah> everything is in the scope of window?
[00:59:52] <Cork> ya
[00:59:57] <hellyeah> so
[01:00:05] <hellyeah> window is the god document is the prophet
[01:00:06] <hellyeah> :D
[01:00:12] <Cork> heh
[01:00:50] <hellyeah> ic
[01:01:15] <STFUn00b> hi guys... what's in your opinion the best framework for developing mobile app / mobile site? i've been using requirejs, backbone and jquery mobile thus far... but something tells me, there are better combinations out there. any ideas? Thanks!
[01:01:19] <Cork> where things becomes funny is when you start to try to map html to document :)
[01:01:47] <Cork> document.documentElement == htm
[01:01:51] <Cork> *html
[01:06:29] <hellyeah> can i ask javascript question here?
[01:06:37] <prohobo> never
[01:06:56] <hellyeah> okey
[01:06:57] <lenswipee> How the heck are you Corky?
[01:08:27] <Cork> prohobo: i think you're irony was wasted
[01:09:14] <hellyeah> Cork:  prohobo did an irony :D
[01:09:17] <hellyeah> ?
[01:09:30] <Cork> heh
[01:09:57] <hellyeah> this is chat actually highly possible to get soemething wrong
[01:10:12] <hellyeah> thats i prefer to not understading sense of humour
[01:10:15] <hellyeah> :D
[01:40:49] <kokut> Cork: how can i use $ instead of jQuery ?
[01:41:19] <kokut> Cork: you said "just use it, unless something is calling $.noConflict()"
[01:42:07] <Cork> kokut: ya, meaning if you include jquery in a page by default it defines $
[01:42:25] <Cork> if you don't have it defined something is either overloading $, or calling $.noConflict()
[01:42:57] <kokut> Cork: is there a way to find it or should i just stick with jQuery ? it just looks ugly
[01:43:30] <Cork> kokut: you could always do something like jQuery(function($) { $ is jQuery })
[01:44:14] <Cork> kokut: as the page you're modifying are removing jquery from $ it might not be safe to just replace it
[01:45:28] <kokut> Cork: k ill just use jQuery then i guess...
[01:49:08] <sebbers_> Can someone offer me advice on whether I should use Interfaces for this challenge or not? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/03ab2950cbbe9db17d70
[01:50:24] <Kartagis> sebbers_: c# ?
[01:50:26] <Kartagis> heh
[01:50:36] <Kartagis> in #jquery?
[01:50:44] <sebbers_> ya but i mean it could apply to any language
[01:51:02] <sebbers_> im more asking about advice on how to implement the interface
[02:17:39] <zagaza> hi guys.. http://jstraight.com/1279/3 .. when you open the collapsible, at the bottom there will appear a button "Close collapsible". When you click that close, the div doesn't animate back up to the top of the content.. is there any simple way to do that? also the top of the content isn't nessecarily the top of the page
[02:34:19] <prohobo> zagaza: what do you mean
[02:34:20] <prohobo> which div
[02:34:52] <prohobo> it looks like it's animating up for me
[02:35:15] <prohobo> im in firefox tho
[02:47:49] <zagaza> prohobo I mean the view is not animating up to the top again
[02:56:00] <arc_> zagaza http://jstraight.com/1279/8
[03:00:13] <prohobo> ah
[03:00:20] <prohobo> you wanted the window to scroll with it
[03:00:24] <arc_> ya
[03:00:25] <prohobo> why didnt you just say so
[03:00:39] <arc_> i think he just misspoke
[03:14:10] <hellyeah> hey
[03:14:42] <hellyeah> so according to what i read toggleClass() do the job of addClass() and removeClass() respetively?
[03:17:13] <piXonix> hellyeah: is anyone helping you with your question?
[03:17:59] <hellyeah> i didnt get any answer yet
[03:18:12] <hellyeah> not sure this type of question is appropriate such support channel
[03:18:18] <hellyeah> i just try to learn stuff
[03:18:21] <piXonix> hellyeah: what exactly are you trying to do?
[03:18:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:18:35] <piXonix> I might also drop off, on the train
[03:19:01] <piXonix> hellyeah: are you trying to change styles of an element based on say a hover event?
[03:19:25] <hellyeah> piXonix:  actually this one i hjave https://jsfiddle.net/3f984zn8/23/
[03:19:39] <hellyeah> when you click button it shows the content and when you click again it hides it
[03:20:05] <hellyeah> so wondering toggleClass() do the job of addClass() and removeClass() respectively
[03:20:16] <hellyeah> i read jquery toggleClass page
[03:20:24] <hellyeah> but i try to understand 100 percentage
[03:20:31] <piXonix> yes, toggleclass will do that on action of an element
[03:21:19] <piXonix> nice, well ask away if there are any other questions
[03:22:29] <hellyeah> okey
[03:22:38] <hellyeah> what is the usage of document.on
[03:22:45] <hellyeah> i saw some examples
[03:23:12] <piXonix> well, that is kind of a broad topic, as there are a lot of things that you can do with it
[03:23:31] <piXonix> but basically it is a listener attached to the document object of the page
[03:23:43] <piXonix> it will listen to say a click, touch, hover, etc.
[03:24:36] <piXonix> it does a bit more as I mentioned, but the most powerful thing, IMO
[03:25:15] <piXonix> is that it lets you attach a listener to an element that may exist now or at anytime in the future
[03:26:08] <piXonix> so if you are loading dynamic content via AJAX, PHP, etc those listeners will still fire
[03:26:10] <hellyeah> i did document.on('click' , button, function(){... }) but i guess this is not the correct way right?
[03:26:51] <hellyeah> when you use document.on events are fired whichever points you click on the window
[03:27:05] <hellyeah> is that right?
[03:29:17] <hellyeah> if the thing i said sounds not relevant i am sorry
[03:29:54] <hellyeah> does it seem "dialog" works https://jsfiddle.net/3f984zn8/27/
[03:30:12] <hellyeah> no
[03:32:33] <piXonix> try something like this: $(document).on("[event]","[target]",function(){});
[03:32:51] <piXonix> replace event with something like click
[03:32:58] <hellyeah> event is click
[03:33:02] <hellyeah> target is button
[03:33:04] <hellyeah> right
[03:33:09] <piXonix> replace target with something like a button, element class, or id
[03:33:31] <hellyeah> $('#button1'); for example
[03:33:42] <piXonix> as long as that lives inside document.ready you should be all set
[03:33:42] <piXonix> putting together a quick fiddle
[03:33:54] <hellyeah> thank you
[03:34:17] <stangeland> if i do location.reload() it will also resend all post data which was send in previous request right?
[03:34:20] <hellyeah> i guess document.ready function is used for setting all dom element right
[03:34:42] <hellyeah> page is not loaded before setting dom completely if you use document.ready
[03:36:40] <piXonix> so are you trying to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/smtierney/cuq4j3p8/
[03:37:58] <hellyeah> yes but how can you avoid event is not fired when you click anywhere on the page "just clicking" button
[03:38:23] <piXonix> that example will only listen for when you click the button with an id of button1
[03:38:45] <piXonix> having $(document). at the beginning does not make the document the target for the event listener
[03:39:06] <piXonix> it simply means to look inside the document object to find the element(s) specified after the type of event
[03:39:17] <piXonix> in this case, input[id=button1]
[03:39:40] <piXonix> the click is not attached to the document, just that one element in this case
[03:40:21] <hellyeah> ic
[03:40:25] <piXonix> read it this way: inside this document, when the user click on the button with an id of button1, perform the following action(s)
[03:40:47] <hellyeah> why do you use 1.8.3? is there any special reason fr that?
[03:40:55] <piXonix> no, just grabbed one
[03:41:03] <hellyeah> ic
[03:41:08] <piXonix> I now use jquery 2.x for a lot of my work
[03:41:14] <hellyeah> because i have to work this in i.e. 8
[03:41:23] <piXonix> ahh
[03:41:31] <hellyeah> jquery 2.x is compatible with i.e. 8
[03:41:45] <Kartagis> I once had to convert all .live to .on. brrr
[03:41:46] <hellyeah> i know pure js will be problematic with i.e. 8
[03:41:55] <piXonix> I wouldn't think so, but it should tell you on the jquery documents
[03:42:53] <hellyeah> piXonix:  one more question jquery is helper for showing content with functionalities in all browser including i.e. 8
[03:43:25] <piXonix> yes, it should work, but there are going to be versions of jquery that may or may not work
[03:43:36] <hellyeah> humm
[03:43:39] <stangeland> if i do location.reload() it will also resend all post data which was send in previous request right?
[03:43:59] <hellyeah> piXonix:  loading all version o f jquery is a solution for that problem?
[03:44:27] <piXonix> well...that would be a ton of over head
[03:44:41] <piXonix> you could sniff the browser and then based on that load a specific library
[03:44:48] <piXonix> have a look at modernizr
[03:44:55] <hellyeah> probably
[03:45:09] <piXonix> I took that and wrote a custom loader for all of our projects that can handle instances like that
[03:45:36] <piXonix> only loads what it needs
[03:45:37] <hellyeah> i am not on that level unfortunately
[03:45:42] <hellyeah> humm
[03:46:01] <hellyeah> actuall i saw smt like that [DATA ..
[03:46:06] <hellyeah> in the head section
[03:46:12] <hellyeah> but i guess it is xml syntax
[03:46:18] <hellyeah> xhtml sorry
[03:46:21] <piXonix> one sec, grabbing a link for you
[03:46:38] <piXonix> inet on the train is pretty slow today
[03:47:11] <piXonix> have a look at this: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_nav_useragent.asp
[03:47:21] <piXonix> it will show you the basics
[03:47:45] <piXonix> once you have the browser agent, you can check for IE 8 in the string, and then load what you need, and for all other cases load something else
[03:49:51] <piXonix_> hellyeah: I would really have a look at modernizr
[03:50:03] <piXonix_> it will do a lot for you without being all that complicated
[03:50:58] <hellyeah> th
[03:51:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:51:09] <hellyeah> whis is what i tried to accompolish btw
[03:51:10] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/cuq4j3p8/3/
[03:51:42] <hellyeah> piXonix_:  i see reading w3 probably hard for me but i will try
[03:51:50] <hellyeah> also i will look at modernizr
[03:53:14] <piXonix_> code looks neat and clean
[03:53:34] <hellyeah> actually small piece of code
[03:53:37] <hellyeah> just a sec
[03:53:55] <piXonix_> small pieces add up to big sites :-)
[03:54:06] <piXonix_> I tell all of my developers, work in small pieces
[03:54:37] <piXonix_> finalize small pieces and then bring them together to solve larger problems...I tell them to take baby steps
[03:55:20] <prohobo> i tell my developers to work in gigantic leaps and if they aren't done by friday night they're fired without pizza
[03:55:35] <prohobo> NO PIZZA FOR YOU
[03:55:39] <piXonix_> well, there is that too
[03:56:08] <piXonix_> the ol pizza threat
[03:56:59] <piXonix> I HATE THE INET ON THE TRAIN
[03:57:39] <hellyeah> piXonix:  this is what i tried to accompolist i need to study little bit http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/67/
[03:57:52] <hellyeah> click not active button and click one of orange, blue, gray or red
[03:58:06] <hellyeah> you will see corresponding line on table will be animated.
[03:58:40] <hellyeah> piXonix:  this is what i did but still my code looks messy and unreadable
[03:58:49] <hellyeah> i need to figure out how to make my code smooth
[03:59:13] <piXonix> well, messy code is not a bad thing IMO, just be sure to leave yourself comments all over the place so that you can pick up where you left off
[03:59:43] <piXonix> also, if you are interested in cleaner code, you have a lot of class names, id's etc attached to elements which you may not need to use
[04:00:11] <hellyeah> i will need to clean it up
[04:00:21] <piXonix> you could use nested element styling to clean some of that up
[04:00:29] <hellyeah> i dont understand ""no pizza" part btw
[04:00:30] <hellyeah> :D
[04:00:44] <hellyeah> nested styling i need to read
[04:01:07] <piXonix> prohobo and I were joking about threats to our dev teams for nto getting work done
[04:01:20] <newbie43> i need to read about nested styling
[04:01:24] <piXonix> I usually start by taking away the beer first
[04:01:29] <newbie43> also i need to read about global variable
[04:01:45] <newbie43> for example in i have some common thing in some rules
[04:01:49] <piXonix> be careful with global vars
[04:01:52] <newbie43> i am not sure how i can do that
[04:01:57] <piXonix> focus more on var scope
[04:02:07] <newbie43> no no in css part
[04:02:15] <piXonix> make sure that you are really opening up what you need, rather than say everything
[04:02:22] <newbie43> global variable in js is evil i guess
[04:02:35] <piXonix> not evil, just dangerous sometimes
[04:02:35] <newbie43> just stick to scope of function
[04:02:49] <newbie43> dangerous in what extent?
[04:03:20] <piXonix> if, like some of my developers you start to re-use var names, and one happends to be a global, weird things can happen
[04:03:31] <piXonix> and break the project in a bad way
[04:03:50] <piXonix> if/when we use global vars, we prepend with and underscore, and use all caps
[04:03:57] <piXonix> so something like this: _GLOBALVAR
[04:04:04] <piXonix> that way it cannot be confused
[04:06:21] <piXonix> also, depending on what you are trying to accomplish, you need to decide if you will pass by reference or by value
[04:07:23] * newbie43 let me read
[04:07:46] <newbie43> okey
[04:07:48] <newbie43> let me ask that
[04:07:58] <piXonix> I was trying to find a link about variable values and reference
[04:08:18] <piXonix> waiting for the browser to load
[04:08:21] <newbie43> if you define var x= blah; as global variable and do x= foo inside function the value of variable is changed right?
[04:08:38] <newbie43> x will be foo
[04:08:55] <piXonix> it should be based on that
[04:09:08] <piXonix> you have re-assigned the variable
[04:09:16] <newbie43> but if you do var x= blah as gloval variable than you doo var x= foo in function. Js behaves X inside the function like a new variable
[04:09:23] <newbie43> no relation with global x
[04:09:36] <piXonix> yes
[04:09:37] <newbie43> because you define x in both place but var states the scope of x
[04:09:44] <newbie43> there wont be some confusion
[04:09:49] <piXonix> but I will also add, you should avoid that...it can become confusing
[04:09:56] <newbie43> ic
[04:10:07] <newbie43> piXonix:  it is matter of perspective?
[04:10:18] <newbie43> or seperation of concern?
[04:10:22] <piXonix> yes, I take a hard stance on variable naming with my teams
[04:10:31] <piXonix> they can certainly be the same
[04:10:51] <piXonix> we try and avoid confusion where possible
[04:11:13] <piXonix> and not using a global and scoped variable that are the same is just one way
[04:23:35] <newbie43> piXonix:
[04:23:39] <newbie43> one more question
[04:24:53] <hellyeah> if you define global var and change the variable of it inside the function and than try to use that variable in other function. Will it take the value is changed inside the function or variable will be reset outside of function namely variable dies out of scope? hope you got my question
[04:29:30] <Cork> hellyeah: depends
[04:29:49] <Cork> globalV = 1; localV = globalV; localV = 2
[04:29:56] <Cork> does not modify the global variable
[04:30:07] <Cork> globalV = { key: 1 }; localV = globalV; localV.key = 2
[04:30:13] <Cork> does change the global variable
[04:30:20] <Cork> save with arrays, and dom elements
[04:30:49] <Cork> basically primitives are always copied, and won't affect the global variable
[04:31:01] <Cork> everything else is referenced so it is the same thing
[04:31:19] <Cork> save with == same with
[04:33:17] <prohobo> what Cork said
[04:46:10] <hellyeah> save with == same with i dont get this
[04:47:07] <hellyeah> i have four checkboxes is there a way to detect which one is clicked?
[04:48:10] <hellyeah> or do i need to have array or node list fill with checkboxes
[04:48:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:52:01] <Sagar> Hi, what is equal to php file_get_contents in jQuery?
[04:58:01] <Cork> Sagar: there isn't one
[04:58:18] <Cork> Sagar: the closest you find in js is ajax, but it is restricted to the same domain
[04:58:39] <Cork> (unless the server explicitly allow third party pages to load html from them)
[05:00:21] <Sagar> Cork: how can we do that with ajax?
[05:04:33] <hellyeah> hey i try to get text of label that checkbox is the child. What is my mistake here. When you click checkbox i want to get performans or izlenmeyenler or  guncel olmayanlar or kritik what is my mistak. Can you give me little help here http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/3/
[05:05:07] <Cork> sagerdearia: $('#target').load('url') for example
[05:05:28] <Cork> or $.ajax('url').done(function(data) {});
[05:05:43] <Sourcey> Hello, I keep gettting undefined on this : http://pastebin.com/TnWs04Vq
[05:05:53] <Sourcey> cant seem to grab the <li> element value
[05:06:11] <hellyeah> actually not this way
[05:06:11] <Cork> Sourcey: li doens't have name
[05:06:25] <Cork> the name is on the a tag
[05:06:37] <Cork> $(this).find('a').attr('name')
[05:07:24] <Cork> Sourcey: actually the simplest solution might be to just change 'li' to 'li > a' instead
[05:07:31] <Sourcey> ah thanks m8
[05:08:21] <Cork> Sourcey: also name is deprecated in later html standards
[05:08:25] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[05:08:33] <Cork> (name on none form fields)
[05:09:14] <Cork> (you most likely want id instead)
[05:09:28] <Cork> or data-something-else
[05:09:55] <Sourcey> I had data-text, this was for testing purposes
[05:10:04] <Cork> ah
[05:10:26] <zagaza> how could I make this animate the opacity from 1 -> 0 when it's being re-collapsed? http://jstraight.com/1279/11
[05:12:38] <Cork> zagaza: 1. always have the unprefixed value LAST in the css
[05:13:05] <Cork> and if you want to transition the opacity you need to change it :)
[05:13:20] <zagaza> Cork: unprefixed value?
[05:13:43] <Cork> transition: 1s ease-in-out; -webkit-transition: 1s ease-in-out; -moz-transition: 1s ease-in-out;
[05:13:56] <Cork> should always be -webkit-transition: 1s ease-in-out; -moz-transition: 1s ease-in-out; transition: 1s ease-in-out;
[05:14:03] <prohobo> http://jstraight.com/1279/12
[05:14:05] <prohobo> zagaza:
[05:14:15] <Cork> and you most likely want to have the -webkit first
[05:14:20] <Cork> as all browsers parse it now days
[05:14:30] <zagaza> ah ok cool thanks :)
[05:14:46] <Cork> (yes -webkit-* is part of the standard now...)
[05:15:24] <hellyeah> -webkit-@keyframes
[05:15:40] <Cork> @-webkit-keyframe but ya
[05:33:45] <ertl> hello, I'm using $.ajax to populate a <select></select> HTML tag, loading values from a database; everything seems to work (values are loaded as expected), but when I post the form the script behind it can't see them...
[05:34:09] <Cork> ertl: make sure select has a name
[05:36:46] <ertl> Cork: *sigh*, you're right, the name was there, but then I forgot to add it back when I populate it... thanks
[05:50:46] <arc_> http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html
[05:50:51] <arc_> cool site, if you have a logitech mouse
[06:01:10] <hellyeah> parent ! mdn
[06:14:21] <hellyeah> hey
[06:14:24] <hellyeah> anyone ardound
[06:14:25] <hellyeah> around?
[06:14:54] <nikio_> ye
[06:15:17] <hellyeah> okey good
[06:15:17] <piXonix> hell yeah hellyeah
[06:16:12] <hellyeah> is there a way to get class value that is defined on css? Here i am able to get parent() of clicked text box but i need color value label1, label2, label3 or label4
[06:16:15] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/22/
[06:16:33] <hellyeah> give me method name if it is possible please
[06:16:48] <Cork> hellyeah: .css('color')
[06:17:25] <hellyeah> humm
[06:18:05] <hellyeah> what about i want to check margin of table and set the position of element right beside it
[06:18:09] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[06:18:52] <Cork> you would have to grab the width of the element including margins remove the width without margin divide it by two
[06:19:04] <Cork> cause there isn't a straight way to grab the margin
[06:19:12] <Cork> hellyeah: also you should do this in css not in js
[06:19:41] <Cork> and as basically all modern browsers support css calc
[06:19:47] <Cork> there isn't much reason to use anything else
[06:20:01] <hellyeah> css calc
[06:20:07] <hellyeah> never heard
[06:21:45] <hellyeah> let me check
[06:25:56] <piXonix> does that makes sense hellyeah?
[06:26:22] <hellyeah> i should check it out yeah it make sense
[06:26:42] <piXonix> the only issues would be if you had more than one class added to the element
[06:27:08] <piXonix> you would need to sort them to some usable type to then search
[06:29:40] <hellyeah> piXonix:  i checked this quesiton i wanna get class that is defined in css file but no result can you help me little bit  http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/25/
[06:30:51] <Cork> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/26/
[06:32:12] <hellyeah> actually try to get content with its class for example when you hit izlenmeyenler i want to get label2{...} because i add to button and change the color of button. In later stage i will do animation
[06:32:19] <hellyeah> i try to use toggleClass
[06:32:31] <Cork> hellyeah: you can't do that
[06:32:39] <hellyeah> humm
[06:32:41] <Cork> jquery works on the dom tree
[06:32:42] <hellyeah> okey
[06:32:47] <Cork> not the css document
[06:32:52] <hellyeah> ic
[06:32:57] <Cork> the class declaration isn't part of the dom
[06:33:06] <hellyeah> i got it
[06:33:25] <hellyeah> so i cannot use toggle class in that scenerio
[06:33:36] <Cork> an option would be to give the labels a color by a separate class name
[06:34:02] <hellyeah> inline?
[06:34:06] <hellyeah> humm
[06:34:12] <Cork> no
[06:34:34] <Cork> think i've told you this a few days ago
[06:34:35] <hellyeah> may be i can add label1, label2, label3, label4 with addClass()
[06:35:03] <Cork> btw... the color values are downcase not Camelcase
[06:35:07] <hellyeah> sorry i dont remember it
[06:35:21] <piXonix> if you are simply trying to mark items with data in some usable way, I would look at using the data attribute, although that might not work in IE 8 like you mentioend earlier today
[06:35:21] <hellyeah> it works also btw
[06:35:43] <piXonix> I am still waiting for the fiddle to load
[06:35:47] <piXonix> still on the train
[06:36:04] <piXonix> which works getting the class attr?
[06:36:06] <hellyeah> where are you going?
[06:36:21] <piXonix> Boston to New York
[06:36:39] <piXonix> regular weekly trip to check-in with the teams down there
[06:36:58] <piXonix> inet is brutal today
[06:37:18] <hellyeah> sso you have some connections ic
[06:38:15] <piXonix> won't matter in a minute, coming into the city soon
[06:38:21] <piXonix> will jump back online when I am in the office
[06:38:31] <piXonix> keep an eye out and let me know if there are any other questions
[06:39:26] <Cork> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/28/
[06:39:53] <Cork> hellyeah: that is how you should do it
[06:40:58] <hellyeah> Cork:  this is the way i am doing how does it look http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/29/
[06:41:25] <Cork> uh...
[06:41:32] <Cork> you just reverted it to what i started with
[06:41:50] <Cork> and no i wouldn't recommend doing it that way
[06:49:22] <hellyeah> sorry for disconnecting
[06:49:49] <hellyeah> Cork:  still there?
[06:50:32] <Cork> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150713.log.html
[06:50:37] <hellyeah> actually this is what i try to do make background color of button when you check checkup boxes
[06:50:42] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/30/
[06:51:29] <hellyeah> Cork:  just try to learn it
[06:51:43] <hellyeah> i will examine what you do now
[06:52:15] <hellyeah> i got this
[06:52:19] <hellyeah> Cork:  thanks
[06:52:48] <Cork> if you want the class to behave differently on different elements
[06:52:55] <Cork> just specify that in the css
[06:53:59] <hellyeah> actually what i try to is to animate the button when you click checkbox yes it seems it behaves differently
[06:54:25] <Cork> hellyeah: so you want css transition
[06:54:42] <hellyeah> css animation can also work
[06:54:46] <hellyeah> yea
[06:55:18] <neanderslob> hi all, Im using cocoon to generate a set of dynamic fields for a particular model (Model A).  In the form I would also like to add fields for another model (Model B) each time I generate the Model A fields with cocoon; does anyone know a good way to do this?
[06:56:05] <Cork> neanderslob: => #cocoon
[06:57:31] <hellyeah> what is cocoon
[06:57:44] <Cork> ?g apache cocoon
[06:57:44] <b-ot> Cork: Cocoon Main Site - Welcome - The Apache Software Foundation! â http://cocoon.apache.org/
[06:57:46] <neanderslob> Cork: sorry, wrong channel :-P
[06:58:03] <neanderslob> hellyeah: it's a ruby gem, thought I was on the rails channel
[06:58:40] <hellyeah> :D
[06:59:34] <hellyeah> Cork:  what if there is more than one class.
[07:00:00] <Cork> the css should define what should happen
[07:01:16] <hellyeah> hmm i just need to find a way to apply color to the background of button not the text http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/34/
[07:02:23] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/35/,
[07:02:25] <Cork> opps
[07:02:26] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/35/
[07:02:56] <hellyeah> you are so fast
[07:03:39] <Cork> this is quite simple things
[07:04:25] <hellyeah> hopefully i can be better tomorrow
[07:11:02] <Daniel_> i've imported a sidebar into my project that opens on top of all of my content in the right/main container
[07:11:08] <Daniel_> instead, I want the open sidebar to push my content over.. the way inspinia works- http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0R5L90S
[07:11:16] <Daniel_> what is the general strategy to achieve this?
[07:11:56] <Cork> Daniel_: modify the left margin of the page when the sidebar is visible
[07:12:53] <Daniel_> Cork: Thank you. are you suggesting that i just update the left-margin when the sidebar has opened?
[07:13:01] <Cork> yes
[07:13:03] <Daniel_> I wonder, won't that make the main content suddenly pop over to the right?
[07:13:14] <Daniel_> so, does it instead need to transition smoothly, the way the sidebar opens?
[07:13:17] <Cork> that is what you asked for
[07:13:29] <Cork> Daniel_: so use css transition
[07:13:48] <Daniel_> gotcha. i have css transition to open the sidebar right now
[07:13:54] <Daniel_> so i guess i'll just css transition the right side as well
[07:13:57] <Daniel_> to make it smaller
[07:14:25] <Cork> Daniel_: or move the menu in instead
[07:14:34] <Cork> else you might get overflow wrapping on the content
[07:14:54] <Daniel_> Cork: move the menu instead?
[07:15:00] <Daniel_> right now i do have css transition on the menu
[07:15:06] <Cork> instaed of modifying the right side of the menu
[07:15:16] <Daniel_> the problem is, it is in a z-index above the main content and so the main-content does not move
[07:15:16] <Cork> have the menu be a fixed width and move the left side of the menu
[07:15:32] <Cork> ya, and that is why you should use margin on the content
[07:15:36] <Daniel_> gotcha
[07:15:41] <Cork> the menu is most likely position fixed
[07:15:49] <Cork> so it doesn't affect the content
[07:16:00] <Daniel_> it is position absolute
[07:16:02] <Cork> (and it should be cause else things would be pushed down, not to the right)
[07:16:09] <Cork> kinda the same thing
[07:16:15] <Daniel_> Okie~
[07:16:17] <Cork> only difference is what it positions it self to
[07:16:31] <Cork> (absolute is page top, fixed is viewport top)
[07:17:34] <hellyeah> okey we add data then we remove data here
[07:22:53] <De0Sama> I'm using a kendo mod for auto completion, and it's working great; however, later on in my order i'm trying to select the element that has been auto completed and jQuery can't find it...
[07:23:04] <De0Sama> anyone have any idea why? The ID doesn't change. :(
[07:27:01] <ueber> hi there
[07:27:07] <De0Sama> hi
[07:27:22] <piXonix> De0Sama: do you have an exampled we can see?
[07:27:51] <De0Sama> piXonix, Unfortunately not. It would take me a really long time to code one. :(
[07:27:52] <ueber> I'm using jQueryUI Combobox, with autocomplete. I'd like to filter results ignoring blank spaces
[07:28:02] <piXonix> hmmm
[07:28:23] <piXonix> so there is no live URL or dev URL that we can see at all?
[07:28:39] <De0Sama> You'd have to be on my company's VPN to see it. :(
[07:28:40] <piXonix> it is going to be tough, but I can give you some ideas of where I would look
[07:28:47] <piXonix> stupid vpn's
[07:28:47] <De0Sama> that would be more than awesome
[07:29:07] <De0Sama> DO you think i might be able to just wrap it in something and select it from there
[07:29:09] <De0Sama> like...
[07:29:18] <piXonix> just to clarify, you have a form field that as yo ustart to type it looks through a variety of data to present auto-completed options to the user
[07:29:25] <piXonix> they then select one and it populates into the field
[07:29:38] <piXonix> you then later try and grab the value that was stored but you are nto able to access it
[07:29:39] <ueber> for example, if the user types "this test" it should filter rows containing both words, as doing on mysql like "%this%test%"
[07:29:42] <piXonix> does that sum up the problem?
[07:29:43] <De0Sama> <div id="foo"><input id="street1"></input></div>
[07:30:48] <piXonix> what browser are you using for dev?
[07:30:49] <De0Sama> piXonix, Kinda. I start off with an input element called "street1", and then use a kendo library to make it into an auto complete field
[07:30:54] <De0Sama> piXonix, chrome
[07:31:21] <De0Sama> piXonix, That changes a lot of elements on the page, creates a few, modifies the street1 element, which makes me believe that's why i can't select it
[07:31:23] <piXonix> if, after you select the auto-complete value can you use the chrome dev tools to verify that the value has been written to the field?
[07:31:34] <piXonix> that could be why
[07:31:39] <ueber> autocomplete is using $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex( request.term )
[07:31:50] <De0Sama> hmm
[07:33:06] <piXonix> it could be a simple bubbling issue, in that once the elements mutate and the listeners were attached to original, the new elements may not be attached to the DOM to be acted upon
[07:33:32] <De0Sama> piXonix, that's kinda what i'm worried about
[07:33:39] <piXonix> basically, the difference between using a .click() event, loading dynamic content and it no longer working
[07:33:49] <De0Sama> hmm
[07:33:52] <De0Sama> i'll try this quick
[07:33:53] <De0Sama> see what i get
[07:34:05] <piXonix> you would need to bind the event to the document, something more like document.on(click,element,function(){});
[07:34:42] <piXonix> if your listener can no longer respond after the element mutates, and you know the value has populated, I would think that is the problem
[07:35:10] <De0Sama> hmm
[07:35:16] <De0Sama> yeah i just tried wrapping it in a div
[07:35:23] <De0Sama> so i could do a $('#foo').children();
[07:35:28] <De0Sama> and it didn't find anything...
[07:35:37] <piXonix> lets take a step back
[07:35:55] <piXonix> on selection of the auto complete value, can you alert the selected value to the screen?
[07:36:07] <hellyeah> piXonix:  how can i add animation to the table when you click checkboxe it will animate with checkbox color pls give me some tipes to achieve that first http://jsfiddle.net/0yygLpdo/36/
[07:36:35] <De0Sama> alright, to give you a big picture
[07:36:42] <piXonix> De0Sama: if that works, can you then alert the value form the field it is being placed into?
[07:36:52] <ueber> anybody could help about filtering rows on jQueryUI Combobox ?
[07:37:28] <lvanderpool> https://gist.github.com/mekhami/567b2d9a5af702283d41 Can anyone help me understand this scope issue? I need to get the results of the ajax request available to the rest of the js, but it's not working in any arrnagement that I've tried so far
[07:37:34] <De0Sama> I've created an order form, what i'm trying to do now is make a button at the very end of the form for sales people to go back to the first step and have the previous customer's address in the address field (Say, if they're working in an apartment building)
[07:38:07] <De0Sama> the entire order form works until you hit that last button. You get back to the first step, and then the address isn't there. When looking into it, i found that it was because $('#street1') couldn't be found
[07:38:27] <De0Sama> so, to answer your question, yeah i can alert out the value :)
[07:38:39] <De0Sama> I'll take a look in my code quick to ensure it though
[07:41:21] <ueber> I need to filter all rows containing both words, ignoring blank spaces
[07:41:47] <piXonix> try this...it might seem a little silly: create a global var that is set to be the value contained within street1, and make sure that this var is set as soon as the page loads
[07:42:03] <piXonix> we might be able to tell the page about the element and use it later on
[07:42:07] <piXonix> just a shot in the dark though
[07:42:20] <ueber> piXonix: talking with me?
[07:42:30] <piXonix> sorry, De0Sama
[07:42:44] <ueber> ok
[07:42:58] <De0Sama> piXonix, hmm, it looks like it's NOT alertable!
[07:43:09] <De0Sama> at least, i can't see it in my console, or alert.
[07:43:21] <De0Sama> granted, the alert didn't even pop up at all, so... that's weird
[07:44:09] <De0Sama> OK
[07:44:13] <De0Sama> just kidding, yep, it's alertable
[07:44:30] <piXonix> I think your gut is right, I think the element is no longer targetable as the DOM does not know that it exists
[07:45:53] <De0Sama> yeah
[07:46:02] <De0Sama> so... global variable, or hidden element?
[07:46:19] <De0Sama> well, i have an object for the entire order that i could grab it from
[07:46:31] <piXonix> a hidden consistent element that you could target would work
[07:46:43] <De0Sama> but i empty that out right after the order is successful for security purposes
[07:46:57] <De0Sama> yeah, that will probably be the easiest
[07:47:01] <De0Sama> i'll just do that right away
[07:47:10] <De0Sama> ueber: what do you need to do?
[07:47:29] <ueber> I need to filter all rows containing words, ignoring blank spaces
[07:47:37] <De0Sama> could you use regex?
[07:47:42] <ueber> for example, if the user types "this test" it should filter rows containing both words, as doing on mysql like "%this%test%"
[07:48:04] <De0Sama> hmm
[07:48:13] <De0Sama> i'm not sure how you're getting your data
[07:48:17] <ueber> the autocomplete code is using; $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex( request.term )
[07:48:45] <ueber> var matcher = new RegExp( $.ui.autocomplete.escapeRegex( request.term ), "i" );
[07:49:25] <ueber> De0Sama: I should modify matcher()
[07:49:43] <De0Sama> i assume matcher is the data you get back, yeah?
[07:54:02] <ueber> De0Sama: here is jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/qg16n0cg/
[07:56:38] <ueber> De0Sama: as you can see autocomplete does not filter words in "any" order
[07:56:56] <ueber> typing "A B C" is different than "A C B"
[08:00:24] <piXonix> hey hellyeah, u still on?
[08:00:44] <ueber> any idea?
[08:03:16] <piXonix> ueber was that directed at me?
[08:03:44] <ueber> piXonix: it was directed to anyone :)
[08:03:50] <piXonix> lol
[08:04:13] <piXonix> looking at your fiddle now
[08:04:45] <piXonix> and what is it not doing again?
[08:04:59] <ueber> typing "A B C" is different than "A C B"
[08:05:12] <ueber> for example, if the user types "this test" it should filter rows containing both words, as doing on mysql like "%this%test%"
[08:05:36] <piXonix> gotcha, let me look again
[08:07:37] <piXonix> in your fiddle, if I type java I get a number of entries correctly
[08:07:45] <piXonix> if I type test I get 2 correctly
[08:07:53] <piXonix> it seems to be working as I would expect it to
[08:08:05] <piXonix> it is basically doing a keyword search correct?
[08:08:13] <ueber> piXonix: yes, but if you type "Java 2000" you don't
[08:08:23] <piXonix> one sec
[08:08:58] <piXonix> ahh, I understand now
[08:10:09] <piXonix> basically what you are doing is performing a linear search, so those 2 words would need to be in the same order that the user is searching in
[08:10:25] <piXonix> what you are looking to do is keyword searches for them anywhere in the stored values
[08:10:52] <piXonix> what you would need to do is take the string being entered by the user, and find any spaces
[08:11:05] <piXonix> once you find those, break the string into an array of values
[08:11:53] <piXonix> you would then loop through each of the words entered by the user to see if any of them match anything anywhere in the stored values
[08:12:32] <piXonix> sorry, that was a lot does that make sense?  I am going to try and tweak your fiddle and see if I can get it to work for you...but I have a client meeting in a little bit
[08:17:19] <ueber> piXonix: ok thanks
[08:26:25] <ueber> piXonix: are you use I need to split it? Is it not possible fixing regex ?
[08:26:38] <piXonix> I am trying both approaches now
[08:26:57] <piXonix> I can split the string and find matches, was going to do the regex next
[08:27:35] <robertmaxrees> gooood morning #jquery
[08:27:45] <piXonix> ueber I do have to run to a meeting though
[08:27:47] <piXonix> sorry about that
[08:28:34] <ueber> piXonix: ok
[08:28:50] <robertmaxrees> ueber i can try to help you - what's up?
[08:29:47] <ueber> robertmaxrees: ok thanks :)
[08:29:55] <ueber> robertmaxrees: I made a fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/csaffi/qg16n0cg
[08:30:09] <ueber> typing "A B C" is different than "A C B"
[08:30:50] <ueber> for example, if the user types "java 2000" it should filter rows containing both words, as doing on mysql like "%java%2000%"
[08:31:13] <robertmaxrees> so you want all results that contain any of the words you've entered?
[08:31:42] <ueber> yes
[08:31:57] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want autocomplete.
[08:32:16] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be confusing for your end-users, but let's poke around.
[08:33:15] <ueber> robertmaxrees: perhaps I've found a solution
[08:33:28] <ueber> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19084976/jquery-autocomplete-matching-multiple-unordered-words-in-a-string
[08:33:58] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic idea, yeah.
[08:44:58] <taplar> ueber: what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/qg16n0cg/2/
[08:45:18] <lyhr> will using the $('#navbar').addClass( ) method only add the class if the class is not currently present?  as in it won't add it again and again if the condition exists?
[08:45:28] <robertmaxrees> taplar try tying "java "
[08:45:31] <robertmaxrees> without quotes :)
[08:45:41] <taplar> crap
[08:45:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qg16n0cg/3/ <- that's the bug i'm fighting here.
[08:45:43] <taplar> hold on
[08:45:45] <robertmaxrees> haha
[08:45:55] <robertmaxrees> lyhr correct.
[08:46:09] <lyhr> robertmaxrees: ty
[08:46:57] <taplar> ueber: http://jsfiddle.net/qg16n0cg/4/
[08:47:27] <szuja> wc
[08:47:37] <robertmaxrees> why not use .filter() instead of those for loops?
[08:47:39] <ueber> taplar: thanks, however response is wrong
[08:48:04] <taplar> just trying to get it working first, :)
[08:48:11] <robertmaxrees> ueber how is it wrong?
[08:48:12] <ueber> :)
[08:49:10] <ueber> typing "java 2000" it should return all strings containing "both" words java && 2000
[08:49:21] <taplar> k
[08:49:37] <robertmaxrees> not java or 2000?
[08:49:40] <lyhr> robertmaxrees: is there a similar method  to .addClass/.removeClass for adding or removing a style?
[08:50:03] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/qg16n0cg/5/
[08:50:50] <taplar> eh, due to the short circut the truth && part could be removed
[08:51:17] <taplar> not shortcircut but loop conditional
[08:51:30] <robertmaxrees> or just use a filter lol
[08:51:42] <ueber> robertmaxrees: no... I said like mysql "%java%2000"
[08:51:55] <taplar> so...
[08:51:58] <taplar> all words
[08:52:00] <taplar> and in order
[08:52:19] <robertmaxrees> ueber yes.  should use .filter() instead of for loops.
[08:52:26] <robertmaxrees> since for loops are weird.
[08:53:25] <taplar> so to verify, "%java%2000", no % at the end?
[08:53:51] <robertmaxrees> ueber what have you come up with so far?
[08:53:55] <ueber> taplar: yes correct "%java%2000%"
[08:53:56] <robertmaxrees> since this is your project.
[08:54:46] <ueber> taplar: this fiddle seems ok http://jsfiddle.net/qg16n0cg/5
[08:55:26] <taplar> ueber: according to your specs, 2000 java does not work
[08:55:41] <robertmaxrees> let ueber figure it out from there, then :)
[08:55:47] <taplar> ^_^
[08:56:55] <ueber> robertmaxrees: thanx :)
[08:57:06] <ueber> taplar: it seems a good ides
[08:57:11] <ueber> taplar: it seems a good idea
[08:59:02] <ueber> taplar: now I'm trying make it work with combobo
[08:59:03] <ueber> taplar: now I'm trying make it work with combobox
[09:10:21] <taplar> did lyhr's last question get attention?
[09:10:26] <robertmaxrees> yep
[09:10:29] <robertmaxrees> i answered it.
[09:10:30] <taplar> k
[09:10:43] <lyhr> I had a follow up sorry is there a similar method  to .addClass/.removeClass for adding or removing a style?
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[09:10:52] <robertmaxrees> that's basiucally the same thing, lyhr
[09:10:58] <robertmaxrees> same story - .css();
[09:11:16] <lyhr> ok thanks again
[09:12:29] <gambl0re> hey robermatrix...if i want to change the pages styling when the scrollbar reaches a certain point, how would i do that?
[09:12:48] <robertmaxrees> really dude?
[09:12:52] <robertmaxrees> again with the wrong username?
[09:13:20] <gambl0re> ?..
[09:13:32] <robertmaxrees> are you talking to me?
[09:13:38] <dijitaltrix> Hi everyone, I've got a weird issue I'm trying to pinpoint if the culprit is JQuery or not..
[09:14:21] <dijitaltrix> I'm sending a form via AJAx to some backend PHP code (Laravel) on my local machine it works, on the live machine it doesn't, the code is identical
[09:14:35] <robertmaxrees> dijitaltrix any console errors?
[09:14:40] <dijitaltrix> so going through and logging everything I can see one difference..
[09:14:41] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab - is that clean?
[09:14:46] <dijitaltrix> robertmaxrees no, no console errors..
[09:14:49] <mooncup> 31
[09:15:41] <dijitaltrix> In the Request Headers sent by JQuery in an ajax call I can see that on my local machine the header output always appears as 'XMLHttpRequest' in the log, however on the live machine the debug output is 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest '
[09:15:57] <dijitaltrix> Im using jquery 1.11.3
[09:16:04] <robertmaxrees> dijitaltrix are you sure you're not hitting CORS?
[09:16:21] <dijitaltrix> robertmaxrees it's the same domain name
[09:16:35] <robertmaxrees> needs to be the same port, protocol, domain, and subdomain(s)
[09:17:29] <dijitaltrix> robertmaxrees the call is getting through, but my php code is not recognising the header 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest '
[09:17:44] <gambl0re> yes i was referring to you..
[09:17:48] <dijitaltrix> and is therefore returning a standard HTTP response rather then a JSON response
[09:17:59] <dijitaltrix> but it's weird because it works fine on my local machine
[09:18:07] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re that's not my username.
[09:18:55] <gambl0re> how would i add an effect to a page when a user scrolls down a page
[09:19:01] <dijitaltrix> I think that jQuery seems to be adding another 'X-Requested-With' to the headers, hence mangling the detection in PHP
[09:19:03] <gambl0re> i tried .scroll()
[09:19:21] <robertmaxrees> dijitaltrix that doesn't sound right to me, but i could be wrong.
[09:19:28] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you use the scroll event on the window.
[09:19:51] <dijitaltrix> robertmaxrees I can't believe it's right either.. but doing a diff thats the only difference I can see and will cause the issue I'm seeing
[09:19:55] <dijitaltrix> but why???
[09:20:20] <robertmaxrees> dijitaltrix i don't know - without seeing any code/your setup/etc, it's hard to know.
[09:22:00] <dijitaltrix> I'm going to have to dig a little deeper..
[09:22:08] <benp> hey is anyone around here? I had some questions which aren't really jQuery related but you all will have cool thoughts maybe
[09:22:21] <robertmaxrees> benp there are over 700 people here ;)
[09:22:48] <taplar_lunch> i have no cool thoughs
[09:22:50] <taplar_lunch> thoughts
[09:22:55] <taplar_lunch> just food.... for now
[09:23:02] <benp> I'm currently using node on the backend and javascript and want to get into some other programming languages. To do web stuff, but shouldn't be web-specific.
[09:23:46] <arc_> so ... ruby or python
[09:23:57] <arthurvr> Depends on your needs but I think Rust and Haskell are two things interesting in your situation. But thereâs many cool stuff out there.
[09:23:58] <robertmaxrees> benp what sort of goals do you have?
[09:24:21] <benp> robertmaxrees: learning and basically being able to do more
[09:24:46] <robertmaxrees> then pick just about any other language.  python's a good choice.  haskell is a neat one.
[09:25:10] <arthurvr> I donât run it in production but haskell makes me think about solving problems in totally another way.
[09:25:20] <arthurvr> which is why most people learn haskell
[09:25:28] <arthurvr> not because they want to really use it much
[09:25:53] <arthurvr> Python in general is always a good choice. Wouldnât do Ruby anymore personally.
[09:26:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'd avoid ruby these days.
[09:26:20] <benp> and Rust?
[09:26:25] <arthurvr> Rust is super cool
[09:26:37] <arthurvr> I use it much but always complimentary with other tech
[09:27:16] <arthurvr> In web applications just build apps with python/node or whatever and rust rocks when you need it
[09:27:39] <arthurvr> there are people using rust to develop whole applications but dunno lolz
[09:27:55] <benp> Yeah I did a hello world and bound it too node one day
[09:28:02] <benp> really easy and the memory management rocks
[09:28:34] <taplar_lunch> tried websockets yet?
[09:28:35] <benp> alright
[09:28:48] <benp> thanks everybody.
[09:29:07] <benp> I was going to go with ruby but that's not really a modern choice anymore isn't it
[09:29:15] <robertmaxrees> "
[09:29:29] <robertmaxrees> *"modern" is a bad way to think about it IMO.  "useful" is maybe the better way?
[09:29:37] <benp> read many good things about rails years ago but now everybody isn't to enthusiast anymore
[09:29:46] <benp> robertmaxrees: yep
[09:29:58] <benp> arthurvr: what are cool haskell intros?
[09:30:02] <taplar_lunch> "meets requirements" and "has good support (documentation)"
[09:30:13] <arthurvr> benp: http://learnyouahaskell.com/ :)
[09:30:21] <arthurvr> then just try solving things like project euler
[09:30:55] <arthurvr> youâll learn a bunch about functional programming and it will force you to think different about problems
[09:31:05] <benp> thx
[09:31:07] <benp> bye
[09:37:19] <taplar_lunch> any known projects written in rust?
[09:37:34] <robertmaxrees> the obvious one is Servo.
[10:18:27] <onatbas> I'm loading a div from another html .get() and .append() . But this external div has some imgs in it which is in localpath such as "myimage.jpg". How can I add the source path src of these imgs ?
[10:18:54] <robertmaxrees> use .attr()
[10:19:51] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to .each() through the images and update the source of them.
[10:21:26] <onatbas> 	$('img').each(function(){ ...});
[10:21:26] <onatbas> this never executes
[10:21:37] <robertmaxrees> you need to $(data).find('img').each()
[10:21:40] <onatbas> I thought I'm doing somethnig wrong :/
[10:22:03] <robertmaxrees> you're running .each() against the wrong thing basically.
[10:24:39] <onatbas> How may I acces to all imgs then?
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> i just explained.
[10:26:21] <robertmaxrees> in the .done() before you append anything.
[10:27:20] <rindolf> Hi all! In http://www.shlomifish.org/fc-solve-temp/js-fc-solve/text/ line 89 in web-fc-solve-ui.js does not seem to get the button in question to click. Why not?
[10:27:36] <rindolf> I tried it in both Firefox and Chromium.
[10:28:20] <robertmaxrees> rindolf what button?
[10:28:38] <robertmaxrees> rindolf that's not much of a reduced test case so you need to make some extra effort here.
[10:28:39] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: the first one inside #dynamic_output.
[10:29:29] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:29:42] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: I generate its HTML markup dynamically using                     $("#dynamic_output").html(html);
[10:30:00] <markholmes> theres no butotn.
[10:30:02] <markholmes> button*
[10:30:15] <robertmaxrees> are you running the binding before you generate the html?
[10:30:26] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: no, after it.
[10:30:53] <robertmaxrees> no idea, then.  maybe try using a delegated listener to make sure?
[10:30:55] <arc_> what does + 1 in a selector do
[10:31:12] <robertmaxrees> arc_ he's generating a selector
[10:31:29] <robertmaxrees> $("#expand_move_" + 1) will select the same thing as $("#expand_move_1")
[10:31:40] <arc_> oh
[10:31:46] <rindolf> arc_: it's just string concatenation.
[10:31:56] <rindolf> markholmes: http://is.gd/rH5cw5 - try pressing "Solve" here.
[10:32:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, try a delegated listener and see if that works.
[10:38:26] <onatbas> http://pastebin.com/9bVWbtQA How can I change access the src tags of imgs in the data (which is a div)?
[10:38:48] <robertmaxrees> $(data).find('img').each(function() {});
[10:41:02] <onatbas> Thanks.
[10:41:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd actually do var $data = $(data); $data.find('img').each();
[10:41:53] <robertmaxrees> then .append($data);
[10:45:45] <notchris> Using each, how can I append something to the first instance of something
[10:45:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:46:59] <robertmaxrees> like, in the first element that matched in the each?
[10:47:17] <notchris> robertmaxrees: exactly
[10:47:20] <notchris> I want to use index I think
[10:47:23] <notchris> within the function
[10:47:33] <notchris> But how do I find index 1 of sayâ¦3 pâs
[10:47:43] <notchris> function(i){
[10:47:52] <dijitaltrix> how can I set the x-requested-with in every ajax request?
[10:48:20] <robertmaxrees> $('p').eq(1) notchris
[10:48:28] <robertmaxrees> or use .get(), depending on what you need.
[10:48:45] <notchris> Ahh didnât think to use eq in this instance, thx robertmaxrees
[10:48:46] <robertmaxrees> dijitaltrix just set it in your ajax function.  ajaxsetup is nice, but case cause nasty surprises later.
[10:49:14] <dijitaltrix> robertmaxrees I"m using $.ajaxSetup({beforeSend: function(xhr) {
[10:49:15] <dijitaltrix>         xhr.setRequestHeader("X-Requested-With", "XMLHttpRequest");}});
[10:49:22] <dijitaltrix> oops
[10:49:24] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use ajaxSetup ;)
[10:49:29] <dijitaltrix> ok why not?
[10:49:42] <robertmaxrees> because later on you'll forget you used it, or somebody else won't know.
[10:49:55] <dijitaltrix> ok, not due to buggy implementation or anything..
[10:49:57] <robertmaxrees> and suddenyl it'll be this funky little surprise.  just do it when yoiu need it.
[10:50:05] <dijitaltrix> sure I know the type..
[10:50:05] <robertmaxrees> nope, just reducing surprises.  trust me.
[10:50:17] <robertmaxrees> like me ;)
[10:50:25] <dijitaltrix> ok so calling $.ajax I can set headers: { header: content }
[10:50:35] <robertmaxrees> using beforeSend, yeah
[10:50:39] <dijitaltrix> lol
[10:50:41] <dijitaltrix> ok
[10:53:41] <claytonzaugg> Could anyone point me to a channel that could help answer questions about cookies and HTML based emails?
[10:54:12] <robertmaxrees> #web, #html.  maybe here?
[10:54:40] <claytonzaugg> Cool, thank you sir
[10:57:05] <dijitaltrix> this is doing my head in.. whre can I post some code for you guys to have a look at?

[10:57:35] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices :)
[11:04:40] <Aboba> I can't seem to get a :contains selector to work
[11:04:48] <Aboba> anyone see anything obviously wrong? http://pastebin.com/M3fkZW7C
[11:05:09] <Aboba> It's not appending anything at all when I run it
[11:05:36] <Aboba> if I remove the span: portion, it selects every tag
[11:06:36] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: hi! The delegated listener indeed worked, but as I discovered, I had a stray space in the id="..." attributes of the generated HTML elements so this could have also influenced it - it's all fixed now though.
[11:08:42] <dijitaltrix> robertmaxrees thx I kow pastebin fell out of favor not sure why thouhg
[11:08:44] <robertmaxrees> adob mnake a fiddle?
[11:08:51] <robertmaxrees> dijitaltrix because of the ads.

[11:09:08] <dijitaltrix> can someone take a look at this and let me know why my header is being hi-jacked?? http://rocketb.in/paste/BR9w8X
[11:09:18] <dijitaltrix> comments below
[11:14:07] <Aboba> robertmaxrees, I figured it out, nm
[11:18:55] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: which header?
[11:19:38] <dijitaltrix> my php code needs the X-Requested-With
[11:19:40] <dijitaltrix> header
[11:19:56] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: why?
[11:20:25] <dijitaltrix>  rindolf you can see when I specify it in the code that it comes through as ua-os: X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRrquest
[11:20:38] <dijitaltrix> it's a laravel function to test wether its an ajas request
[11:20:40] <dijitaltrix> ajax
[11:21:01] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: ah.
[11:21:16] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: did you use a TCP sniffer?
[11:21:30] <dijitaltrix> for some reason when I set the header using beforeSend function jQuery puts it under the ua-so header
[11:21:49] <dijitaltrix> rindolf no, it's weird it works on my local VM but not on the identical remote machine
[11:22:18] <dijitaltrix> rindolf I didn't use TCP sniffer ( I don't have access to one), but I am logging the headers
[11:22:39] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: then please use a TCP sniffer to see what the actual HTTP request is.
[11:23:03] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: you can use wireshark.
[11:27:21] <dijitaltrix> rindolf I'll have to grab it and isntall it.. it's a project for tonight I htink.. been on this for hours...
[11:31:06] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: ah.
[11:31:31] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: you can also try installing the development version of jQuery and debugging the code using a JS Debugger.
[11:31:41] <dijitaltrix> rindolf yeah got to figure out how to use wireshark now..
[11:32:00] <dijitaltrix> might try revert to an earlier version of jquery that does work first..
[11:32:14] <rindolf> dijitaltrix: OK.
[11:49:58] <iCHAIT> hello
[11:49:59] <iCHAIT> http://dpaste.com/12E7XS5
[11:50:16] <iCHAIT> For the above I want to append some stuff at the end.
[11:50:27] <iCHAIT> using the variable name random.
[11:50:41] <iCHAIT> How do I access the last child of that variable?
[11:51:21] <robertmaxrees> the last child of random?
[11:51:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just insert at the end of random
[11:51:39] <robertmaxrees> ?
[11:51:50] <iCHAIT> I can't
[11:51:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:52:00] <iCHAIT> I mean I can
[11:52:08] <iCHAIT> But I have different use case
[11:52:14] <iCHAIT> After the last append
[11:52:21] <iCHAIT> I want to append an option tag
[11:52:26] <iCHAIT> Which has multiple values
[11:52:33] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to append to the select?
[11:52:42] <iCHAIT> exactly.
[11:52:51] <robertmaxrees> btw .append($("<option>").attr("value", prodId) - use .val() instead
[11:53:05] <robertmaxrees> and i'd build everything up separately.
[11:53:56] <robertmaxrees> and then manually append around that way.
[11:54:03] <robertmaxrees> instead of doing a bunch of chaining like you're doing.
[11:54:42] <iCHAIT> Yeah good idea, I should do it that way.
[11:55:10] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: But as of now, for appending something to the end of random I'll need the last child of random, right?
[11:56:07] <iCHAIT> Or I can directly right random.append(someStuff);
[11:59:48] <robertmaxrees> iCHAIT .append() will insert someStuff as the last child of whatever you run it on.
[12:00:22] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: Okay, so no need to particularly use the last child and then append?
[12:00:55] <robertmaxrees> nope - .append() inserts something as the last child of a node.
[12:01:16] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: OKay, thanks :)
[12:01:31] <ceramicskull> hola robertmaxrees
[12:01:32] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the docs say as much :)
[12:02:03] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: Just out of curiosity, if I had to access the last child?
[12:03:04] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.  i'd go for .children().last(), though it depends on what you mean by "last"
[12:03:39] <iCHAIT> Okay :)
[12:35:21] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees: any kind of pages out there that show you how to export selective data to specific cells in Excel?
[12:35:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:37:51] <ceramicskull> like I have a bunch of data in a table, now I want to export specific data into a premade excel sheet, into specific cells
[12:38:15] <ceramicskull> Like I know how to export to a PDF or Excel with a current table.
[12:38:24] <ceramicskull> I just don't know if I can make it more specific
[12:38:44] <lacripta> hello guyz i need some help with js and i think this is the right place to ask
[12:39:17] <lacripta> i have an object array, how can i make every member of this object into another separate array
[12:39:33] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull i'm confused - is this related to jquery somehow?
[12:39:44] <robertmaxrees> lacripta show us what you mean.
[12:39:50] <robertmaxrees> because "object array" is redundant :)
[12:40:27] <lacripta> obj[0] = {a:'1', b:'asd'} make this a[], b[]
[12:40:43] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:40:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:40:53] <lacripta> srry i was meaning like a class object :D
[12:41:01] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't have classes, so...
[12:41:03] <ceramicskull> I'm guessing it is? Jquery has the functions to create an excel sheet, but I want to know if it has the functions to let me insert information into pre-made excel sheets and into specific cells
[12:41:12] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull huh?
[12:41:15] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[12:41:23] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't know anything about making spreadsheets.
[12:41:49] <robertmaxrees> lacripta http://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/ - you want to take this object and do what with it?
[12:42:03] <ceramicskull> Then how is there jquery tools to create excel sheets?
[12:42:15] <Crucials> ceramicskull yes you could probably save your data as a CSV and open it with excel
[12:42:21] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull those are separate from the library itself.  they add that functionality.
[12:42:32] <lacripta> i can loop through obj[] and access every member of obj and make a new array of every member of obj
[12:42:32] <Crucials> but its not really jquery related
[12:42:36] <robertmaxrees> but jquery itself doesn't have anything that deals with excel or spreadsheets directly.
[12:42:46] <ceramicskull> Yea, I know that, but I want to know if it's possible to get more specific with the data, as in hide certain things and place certain data into certain cells
[12:42:59] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull i have no idea - you'd have to show me what plugin you're using.
[12:43:20] <robertmaxrees> i would assume you could do something like that - csv assumes a particular order, for instance.
[12:43:52] <lacripta> https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/ here is whai i mean
[12:44:03] <robertmaxrees> need to hit "update", lacripta
[12:44:04] <Crucials> you could have some sort of large object that you can manipulate and then safe as a csv file, but again its not really jquery related
[12:44:06] <robertmaxrees> and then share the new URL.
[12:44:23] <lacripta> srry about that https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/1/
[12:44:39] <ceramicskull> That's actually what I'm asking, to see if there is a plugin out there lol - Like I know there are ways to export data to a PDF or Excel using jquery, but I just want to be able to control where that info is exported into rather than have a plain excel sheet with table data ; p
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> lacripta so you want to map an object's properties to new arrays?
[12:44:52] <lacripta> yup
[12:45:09] <robertmaxrees> well for(i = 0; i < myObject.length; i++){ isn't the right way to do that lol.
[12:45:10] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:45:24] <lacripta> yeah i know i can use .each or something
[12:45:24] <robertmaxrees> lacripta actually, wait, this isn't as easy as you'd think.
[12:45:43] <lacripta> i know it not quite easy i been thinking over it for a while now
[12:45:52] <robertmaxrees> it's easy, just weird.
[12:46:01] <Crucials> i mean the way you're doing it is kind of odd
[12:46:26] <Crucials> like why would you want an array a[] with only 1 index
[12:46:26] <robertmaxrees> lacripta https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/2/
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> is this what you're looking for?  because that doesn't make much sense either?
[12:46:38] <ceramicskull> Crucials, where do you think I should be asking this? I'm trying to get this to be done through jquery lol
[12:47:05] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull ou really should jkust generate csv files.
[12:47:26] <lacripta> Crucials, this was just an example i have an object of 9k index with 10 properties
[12:47:31] <robertmaxrees> lacripta maybe showing us a more fleshed-out example?
[12:47:35] <robertmaxrees> with more than 2 properties?
[12:47:53] <Crucials> well i mean its pretty general in terms of programming, you could generate an csv file with any language, im assuming you are getting the data online so probably jsut ##javascript is a little better
[12:48:00] <Crucials> because jquery itself doesnt deal with spreadsheets
[12:48:24] <robertmaxrees> lacripta you're goin to wind up basically wrapping each property's value in an array, which doesn't really make sense.
[12:48:59] <Crucials> i feel like theres an xy problem hiding here
[12:49:01] <lacripta> the thing is that i need to have the values in an arrays, im using highcharts and i think it doesn't undestands anything aside from array of values
[12:49:21] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:50:06] <robertmaxrees> like, why not update the backend service instead?
[12:51:54] <lacripta> is it really a good idea to make 10 queries to get the 10 arrays i need? im kind of list in this area
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> that's not what we're saying.
[12:52:11] <lacripta> here is what i do with my object https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/4/
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help.
[12:52:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to show us a more fleshed out example.
[12:53:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/5/ - are you trying to simply wrap each property in an array?
[12:58:04] <lacripta> this what im doing atm https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/6/
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> er.
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> this really doesn't help.
[12:58:51] <lacripta> :(
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - nothing in here deals with arrays.
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> at least as far as data and that for loop are concerned.
[12:59:59] <Crucials> lacripta that object "data" at the top, thats the kind of object you have?
[13:00:06] <lacripta> yes
[13:00:15] <robertmaxrees> so you want to take that object and do what with it?
[13:00:19] <robertmaxrees> what should it end up looking like?
[13:00:36] <lacripta> an array of every property of that object
[13:00:53] <Crucials> ah
[13:00:57] <Crucials> thats much different
[13:01:04] <robertmaxrees> but just the properties?
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> not their values?
[13:01:12] <lacripta> values
[13:01:15] <Crucials> i was assuming just the values
[13:01:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:01:29] <lacripta> i dont care about the name, i can hold the values in other array an use that
[13:01:31] <robertmaxrees> lacripta so what should this array look like?
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> make an example in the fiddle of what you want.
[13:02:17] <lacripta> its in there, in the loop i go through every property and put in a new array, then i use the array at series part in the part of the chart
[13:02:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to read your code to try to understand it ;)
[13:02:49] <lacripta> at line 76, 82 and 88
[13:02:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:03:09] <robertmaxrees> "hey make sure i actually understand what you want and show me the end result you're looking for"
[13:03:35] <lacripta> the end result is just an array of values a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
[13:03:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/rge34p2h/7/
[13:03:57] <robertmaxrees> then do this.
[13:09:40] <robertmaxrees> lacripta is that what you're looking for?
[13:10:16] <lacripta> im doing some test and see what happens, its the same i did with the for loop but using the map so it should work better
[13:13:23] <lacripta> well it does i think, but it only works for one property wouldnt this hurt performance for 9 properties.
[13:13:40] <lacripta> i mean i would have to run it 9 times to get the arrays i need
[13:15:24] <lacripta> robertmaxrees, can this loop populate other arrays or only the returning value?
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:17:35] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to run it against each object you need to transform.
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> 9 different objects wouldn't be a big deal.
[13:31:53] <lacripta> robertmaxrees, is it a badpractice to use for loops i sjs code, i tried your code using the map function it was 50 ms but still
[13:32:11] <lacripta> 50 ms faster
[13:35:05] <robertmaxrees> for loops are prescriptive, but map, foreach, etc are descriptive.
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> ie you're describing the end result you want, instead of telling the computer how to do its job.
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> the fwiw, don't worry about performance until it becomes an issue.  focus on writing readable code first.
[13:36:59] <lacripta> thats why im using your example it work really well i liked the solution
[13:37:14] <lacripta> it was more clear and easy to modify
[13:37:50] <lacripta> you know of a good way to sort the returning array of the map method
[13:49:27] <Razerglass> if I am adding / removing a class whats the best way to chain a transition on it so it doesnt the css change doesnt just 'flash' into the screen?
[13:55:45] <zzaichik> Razerglass: you handle the transition in the css.
[14:07:05] <javascript413> cjohnson hey, when I asked about document height not being calculated correctly you advised I use window.heigh, which is the viewport's height. however that is only the height of the resolution of the screen, if I am not mistaken
[14:07:39] <javascript413> I need  a way to determine the height of the entire webpage. but document.height does not work. :( any ideas?
[14:08:50] <txt_> $('window').height();
[14:08:51] <txt_> ?
[14:09:04] <txt_> or 'document'
[14:11:06] <javascript413> I am using wordpress cms, and if I use $(document).height() the value returned is almost 2 times too large. (around 6600, but manually scrolling to the bottom is only on 3500)
[14:11:42] <javascript413> if I use $(window).height() i get the size of the browser screen. so if i minimize the value is smaller. bot nowhere near the size of the webpage
[14:12:02] <javascript413> not minimize. make the browser into a smaller window*
[14:13:56] <javascript413> Can I somehow check if a div is inside the viewport?
[14:14:39] <txt_> how about 'body'
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> javascript413 yeah - see if the offset().top of the element is between the window's scrolltop and the window's scrolltop minus the window height.
[14:24:19] <robertmaxrees> err, window's scrolltop PLUS the window height.  not minus.
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[15:05:09] <javascript413> robertmaxrees hey! thanks for your help, I've managed to put together something resembling javascript. it works, but could you please look at it and tell me if there's anything wrong with it? http://pastebin.com/Et1uMhUs
[15:05:28] <javascript413> oh also, i've been told you are really good. :) thanks for your help again :D
[15:07:23] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:07:35] <robertmaxrees> let's reason about this real quick.
[15:07:46] <javascript413> I've simplified your suggestion a bit, because I know that the element I am trying to find is always going to be close to the bottom. Also the users can't scroll past the div element I'm looking for, so there's no need to see if it's between scrolltop and scrolltop+window height.
[15:07:47] <javascript413> is that okay?
[15:08:03] <robertmaxrees> that's making some assumptions.
[15:08:21] <robertmaxrees> but that's not the first problem here.
[15:08:38] <robertmaxrees> (function($) { }(jQuery)) <- why do you have this wrapped around your code?
[15:09:36] <javascript413> because I am trying to put the code into wordpress, and before it did not even work, but then a user pasted the code wrapped into that and it started to work.
[15:10:09] <robertmaxrees> heh, let's do that the "right" way.
[15:10:10] <javascript413> Oh, i should note, I am very much a beginner. brand new, so I've no knowledge about jscript language, past trial and error, and some quick reading. :)
[15:10:16] <javascript413> i'd love that :D
[15:10:44] <robertmaxrees> *javascript language.
[15:11:37] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/9c828d96f8b0
[15:11:39] <robertmaxrees> so start here.
[15:11:53] <robertmaxrees> see the first change?  we're going to walk through some other fixes in a second, too.
[15:12:15] <javascript413> you moved jquery to top, and lost the function($)
[15:12:41] <robertmaxrees> sort of. i ditched the IIFE and i'm just using the document ready to replace what you were using it for.
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> next - doing $() is expensive.  doing $() inside of a scroll event listener is REALLY expensive.  it can slow things down appreciably.
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> you should minimize how much you're doing - check out https://bpaste.net/show/020edec74d5f
[15:15:30] <javascript413> okay wait. i'm not following you. I'm still at IIFE :). Give me some minutes to read up on document ready and iife and what $() even is. Like I said, I haven't gone at that systematically. I know i can't learn this anywhere near fast enough, but 20minutes of reading and I should at least understand your words. :p
[15:16:06] <robertmaxrees> so let's back.
[15:16:09] <robertmaxrees> *back up.
[15:16:16] <robertmaxrees> IIFE - immediately invoked function expression.
[15:17:10] <robertmaxrees> it lets you have a one-time use throwaway scope.  this is nice because it also allows you to "protect" certain variables.  You can also redefine them with another name - you were using it for this purpose.
[15:17:32] <robertmaxrees> you were using that IIFE to rename jQuery to just $.  make sense?
[15:22:23] <javascript413> hmmm, sort of. using (function($) {     $(document).ready(function() {
[15:23:25] <javascript413> but there are 2 concepts that are combined here and are a bit confusing. so document.ready means that the script waits for DOM, right?
[15:23:49] <javascript413> and instead you can use $()
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ready() runs whatever function you give it when the "dom" is ready.
[15:23:53] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:24:27] <javascript413> and you also told me in my code jQuery as renamed to $
[15:24:36] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[15:24:37] <javascript413> so $ and $() are not the same?*
[15:24:42] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[15:25:02] <robertmaxrees> in your code, notice how you were doing (function($) { }(jQuery)); ?
[15:25:14] <javascript413> yep, that's what we started with :)
[15:25:32] <robertmaxrees> right - that's basically letting you "rename" the name jQuery to $.
[15:25:54] <javascript413> ah okay
[15:26:19] <robertmaxrees> we're replicating that functionality but using something build in to doc ready to handle that for us.
[15:26:36] <javascript413> aaah makes sense, because I was getting errors before that wrapper was added, and I'm assuming $ wasn't representing jQuery? is that correct?
[15:26:59] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:27:31] <javascript413> okay got it :)
[15:27:54] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { /* your code here */ }); is just a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[15:28:32] <javascript413> --which in itself is shorthand for jQuery(document).ready.... ?
[15:28:49] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:29:02] <javascript413> but didn't we rename jQuery to $--
[15:29:12] <robertmaxrees> wordpress runs things in noConflict mode, which means that it hands back $
[15:29:20] <robertmaxrees> it's not a shortcut, just a variable name.
[15:29:22] <javascript413> okay nevermind, I'm wasting your time with my basic questions. :p I obviously need to learn the basics myself :D
[15:29:42] <robertmaxrees> it's cool.
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> it's why we're here.
[15:30:09] <robertmaxrees> basically, $(document) and jQuery(document) mean EXACTLY the same thing.  just two different names for the same thing.
[15:30:50] <robertmaxrees> because $ = jQuery
[15:30:54] <javascript413> yeah, that's what I meant. so, $ is a variable, and we set $ to be jQuery by doing jQuery(function($)
[15:31:03] <robertmaxrees> within that function, yeah.
[15:31:07] <javascript413> right :)
[15:34:24] <javascript413> you said I should always avoid having $() inside a scroll statement?
[15:34:46] <robertmaxrees> inside a scroll event handler, yeah.
[15:35:58] <javascript413> but the only difference I can spot is that you made (window) into a variable...?
[15:36:25] <javascript413> wait
[15:36:25] <javascript413> no
[15:37:01] <robertmaxrees> window and that other selector.
[15:38:29] <javascript413> because you don't want the selector and (window) to be calculated each time scroll event handler fires?
[15:39:10] <robertmaxrees> so $() runs a constructor function that creates a new object each time it's run.  we want to minimize that as much as possible.
[15:40:30] <cannap> cache them
[15:40:36] <cannap> var bla = $()
[15:41:19] <robertmaxrees> some people call that "caching".
[15:41:24] <robertmaxrees> which is basically what you're doing.
[15:41:54] <javascript413> lovely. so to recap what you've told me so far: we cleaned up the document.ready function and removed the needles iife. Oh btw, why do we not need IIFE? What if there are other scripts running on the wordpress website which would take $?
[15:42:14] <robertmaxrees> javascript413 it depends.
[15:42:26] <robertmaxrees> that one IIFE wouldn't fix that anywhere else.
[15:42:49] <robertmaxrees> only inside of that one place.  you could create a separate IIFE to house that other code.
[15:43:05] <robertmaxrees> but you don't need it because you replaced its functionality by updating the document rady.
[15:43:06] <robertmaxrees> *ready
[15:44:09] <javascript413> cool. you also mentioned some assumptions that I made, which I'm guessing were bad? :p
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> it's up to you, but this code could fire as soon as the user sees 1 pixel of that footer-surround thing.
[15:44:51] <robertmaxrees> is that what you want?
[15:45:31] <javascript413> Let me explain what I'm actually trying to achieve. I'm sure you'll be able to judge this better than me anyway. :D
[15:46:49] <javascript413> I have a website which lists some items in a list. At the end of the list, (which is about 3000px high) there's a "load more" button. I want to automate the 'click' event for this button, as soon as a user scrolls to the end of the list.
[15:47:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd just call the function to load things directly.
[15:47:14] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[15:48:24] <javascript413> That was my first though. But I didn't know how to figure out exactly what the function was.
[15:48:32] <javascript413> thought*
[15:49:00] <robertmaxrees> okay.  what does that have to do with this window alert code?
[15:49:57] <javascript413> nothing at all. It's just a way to debug if it's working on my page or not. sorry, I should have explained it all to you from the start. :( I hope that didn't waste your time.
[15:50:19] <robertmaxrees> lol stop apologizing so much.  it's not a big deal.  use console.log() for debugging instead.
[15:50:31] <robertmaxrees> and in that case, you should start loading content before the user sees the button.
[15:51:08] <javascript413> in that case I can just add value to one side of the if equation
[15:51:19] <robertmaxrees> subtract from the other fwiw.
[15:51:21] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/c29cbe98f607
[15:51:25] <robertmaxrees> makes it a little clearer.
[15:52:36] <javascript413> ok, btw why did you decide to subtract from right side, as opposed to adding on the left?
[15:52:44] <javascript413> oh, just for readability?
[15:52:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:53:35] <javascript413> I used console.log for determining the values and initial test. But I found that alert was more useful as I could test the website full screen.
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> alert halts execution, which is bad.
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> it can make things difficult to really debug as a result.
[15:54:06] <javascript413> Do you think it would be better to find the proper function I need to call instead of using a click event?
[15:54:18] <robertmaxrees> very much so.
[15:54:26] <robertmaxrees> proxying through the dom to call code is funky.
[15:56:13] <javascript413> yeah, that was my first thought too. That it isn't the most elegant way by far. But dude, you should see my website, i feel like I'm playing one of those tower builder games, where the tower starts swaying more and more, and I'm just piling shit up as fast as I can before it all collapses....
[15:56:32] <robertmaxrees> that's just going to cause you more and more problems.
[15:56:55] <javascript413> indeed it will :s
[15:56:57] <robertmaxrees> start paying down that technical debt little by little.
[15:57:14] <javascript413> I love clean code. I just don't have the skills for it. :)
[15:57:23] <robertmaxrees> heh, just need to start.
[15:58:38] <javascript413> you said: "proxying through the dom to call code is funky." but I need to check for the button visibility, even if I find the proper function call.
[15:58:55] <javascript413> so the if statement we made has to stay like it is, right?
[16:01:58] <robertmaxrees> that part stays.
[16:02:13] <robertmaxrees> you just call the code directly instead of faking a button clock.
[16:02:15] <robertmaxrees> *click
[16:04:47] <javascript413> yeah. I'll try doing that. But first, can you help me to finish the if statement? We introduced a new erro with your version. "Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment"  on the line: "$window.scroll(function() {"
[16:14:52] <bob_the_plumber> Does anyone know where I can download the jQuery 2.1.4 full API documentation? Kind of like how you can download the SDL2.0 documentation from the wiki.
[16:18:16] <robertmaxrees> javascript413 let me poke.
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> javascript413 https://bpaste.net/show/587e5c51c8c8
[16:19:13] <robertmaxrees> bob_the_plumber not that i know of other than running the site locally.
[16:19:20] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't just use the site?
[16:28:08] <Crucials> there is an offline version of it, i remember having it at some point
[16:38:59] <javascript413> robertmaxrees thanks a lot for your help. you really are awesome! I'll continue this later. i guess tomorrow. which means we'll probably speak soon. hehe :)
[16:40:09] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:27:46] <stranger_> I have this code (https://dpaste.de/jCEs) working on my desktop browser
[17:27:53] <stranger_> but i am not sure if this would work if i tried to access on my mobile
[17:27:57] <stranger_> i am using localhost so i could not test it on my mobile (or is there a method which i am not aware of)
[17:28:04] <stranger_> please advise thanks!!!!
[17:30:17] <robertmaxrees> you can emulate mobile using chrome fwiw
[17:30:53] <robertmaxrees> you could also setup a local server and hit that with your phone.
[17:41:14] <stranger_> what is chrome fwiw , tried google but no much information? :o
[17:47:54] <ExecSlim> stranger_ you can emulate your mobile device using Chrome. Go to Inspect Element > Emulation > choose device
[17:48:23] <stranger_> NICE
[17:48:24] <stranger_> ohhhh
[17:48:25] <stranger_> THANKS :)
[17:48:32] <stranger_> i'll try it ! omg thanks
[17:49:23] <ExecSlim> No problem
[17:49:49] <markholmes> stranger_, fwiw means "for what it's worth"
[17:50:23] <stranger_> ohhh oops =p
[17:50:25] <stranger_> thanks =)
[17:51:52] <skione> Hi, I am troubleshooting a problem. I am integrating an open source knowledge base and I am crawling the production web site and pulling the header and footer. When I do this, it makes the JQuery set an id to display none
[17:52:11] <skione> how can I figure out what is causing that? I realize its a broad question but I am not sure how to ask it
[17:54:30] <markholmes> show us the site?
[17:57:02] <skione> yea never mind, I am a dunce
[17:57:19] <skione> mostly because I had already solved this problem and I just forgot to do it
[17:57:38] <skione> I have like 10 of these things to do, its stupid repiditive tasks but it pays pretty good
[17:57:41] <mojtaba> Hi, is it possible to convert a div tag to h3 tag and change its text at the same time?
[17:57:44] <skione> thanks for offering markholmes
[17:58:08] <skione> mojtaba: can you chain your commands together?
[17:58:30] <mojtaba> skione: what is the command for changing tags?
[18:00:04] <skione> well I don't think you can convert, per se, you would have to add and remove
[18:00:07] <skione> I think
[18:00:13] <ExecSlim> mojtaba, try http://stackoverflow.com/a/20469901
[18:00:33] <mojtaba> ExecSlim: thx
[18:00:48] <skione> thats cool, not sure when I would ever need it
[20:25:10] <retnull> Hi all, I need some help. I'm using jEasyUI in my project I wish to use jQueryUI functions draggable & dropabble, but jEasyUI has overridden them. What do I do here, i'm pretty new to javascript and JQuery
[20:34:43] <mojtaba> Hi, I know that this might not be very relevant, but if you know please help me. I have created a form and the problem is that I do not know how prevent action php file from being directly executed. Does anybody know what should I do?
[20:37:03] <stranger_> what do u mean
[20:37:19] <stranger_> <form action="filename.php method="POST"></form>
[20:38:06] <mojtaba> stranger_: Yes, when I put the address of the filename.php in the address bar, it just get executed.
[20:39:46] <stranger_> then on what condition do you want it to be execute?
[20:41:19] <mojtaba> stranger_: just when the user click on the submit button of the form
[20:42:05] <stranger_> u do already have a button there ya?
[20:42:15] <mojtaba> stranger_: yes
[20:45:25] <stranger_> then is your button type submit?
[20:45:59] <mojtaba> stranger_: yes
[20:46:07] <mojtaba> stranger_: Do you know what should I do?
[20:49:09] <stranger_> by right, it will not execute the action part unless the button is clicked
[20:49:14] <stranger_> you mean yours is executed on page load?
[20:49:23] <mojtaba> stranger_:
[20:49:25] <mojtaba> no
[20:49:43] <mojtaba> stranger_: when I paste the full address of the action in the address bar it get executed.
[20:50:39] <stranger_> use javascript
[20:51:50] <stranger_>  document.getElementById("myForm").submit(); where myForm is your <form id="myForm" ... >
[20:52:04] <mojtaba> stranger_: thanks. But that does not work.
[20:52:11] <mojtaba> Does anybody else know what should I do?
[20:52:13] <stranger_> in ur button , onclick="functionName()")
[20:52:21] <stranger_> could you paste your code
[20:54:45] <retnull>  Hi all, I need some help. I'm using jEasyUI in my project I wish to use jQueryUI functions draggable & dropabble, but jEasyUI has overridden them. What do I do here, i'm pretty new to javascript and JQuery
[20:55:04] <retnull> I timed out
[21:19:04] <CovertOps> hi i'm having a problem with jquery not executing more than one function at a time
[21:23:31] <retnull> CovertOps: How is that so?
[21:30:25] <CovertOps> retnull, when i try to execute more than one function in an onclick, it only executes one
[21:30:58] <CovertOps> i have a button with an onclick event, calling a function inside a linked .js file. the function makes a curl call
[21:31:19] <CovertOps> i tried to add a page refresh after the curl call
[21:31:24] <CovertOps> and it stopped making the curl call
[21:32:59] <retnull> CovertOps: can you provide a link to your code, maybe pastebin.org
[21:33:12] <CovertOps> yeah gime a min i'll make a pastebin
[21:43:36] <CovertOps> this is interface.html, http://pastebin.com/ebtZExd3
[21:43:49] <CovertOps> this is script.js http://pastebin.com/hrK40JHu
[21:43:59] <CovertOps> this is curl.php, http://pastebin.com/q9aFqAA6
[21:44:16] <CovertOps> i won't bother with style.css, but assume that the classes are defined correctly
[21:44:46] <CovertOps> it's connected to a wifi aREST device, i wrote the aREST api for it myself
[21:45:12] <CovertOps> i want it to poll the device for the status, then set the style of the buttons based on the status of the device
[21:48:14] <CovertOps> so pressing the button should make the curl call to the device, then every 2 seconds the .js is polling the device
[21:48:32] <CovertOps> it will seem like pressing the button changes the button
[21:48:41] <CovertOps> if that makes sense
[21:56:15] <CovertOps> any ideas?
[22:49:46] <AliG1000> I have set up some ajax to update a database when a checkbox is checked.  However, the Request URL doesn't appear to get hit even though the status code is 200 OK.  Could there be reason for this?
[22:58:44] <rand0m> ahoy mates!

[23:14:38] <PiL> that would be very dry
