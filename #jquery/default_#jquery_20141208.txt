[01:00:49] <titii> How to make parseHTML() funkctionality for 1.7 version?
[01:01:50] <Cork> titii: what do you mean?
[01:02:11] <titii> How to convert html string into object for DOM traversing...
[01:02:15] <titii> and so on
[01:02:18] <Cork> $(html)
[01:02:38] <Cork> same as in later versions
[01:04:59] <blackkbot> does jquery ever lose functions?
[01:05:14] <Cork> lose?
[01:05:23] <Cork> as in forget?
[01:05:26] <blackkbot> no
[01:05:35] <blackkbot> like upgrade and change the name
[01:05:49] <blackkbot> through revisions
[01:05:51] <Cork> functions are deprecated and removed yes
[01:06:01] <blackkbot> really?
[01:06:04] <Cork> sure
[01:06:14] <Cork> just check api.jquery.comn
[01:06:17] <Cork> *just check api.jquery.com
[01:06:19] <blackkbot> because i swear theres a million functions in jquery
[01:06:58] <Cork> well ya, they don't remove functions/rename them just for the fun of it
[01:07:12] <Cork> if backwards compatibility is easy to maintain they will (and should)
[01:07:26] <Cork> an example of a removed function is http://api.jquery.com/live/
[01:08:00] <Cork> and here is a complete list http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[01:08:14] <blackkbot> lol thats a short list
[01:08:35] <Cork> blackkbot: why should it be a long list?
[01:09:00] <Cork> and here is the removed functions http://api.jquery.com/category/removed/
[01:09:05] <blackkbot> well because if someone wants to use the older functions they shouldn't update the jquery library...
[01:09:15] <Cork> uh
[01:09:29] <Cork> no
[01:09:38] <Cork> cause you get compatibiltiy problems if you mix jquery versions
[01:09:56] <Cork> but ya, the functions that has cost isn't kept
[01:10:21] <Cork> bind/unbind/delegate/undelegate for example is kept cause the cost is none existent
[01:10:28] <Cork> its just an alias for .on
[01:10:32] <Cork> no actual code there
[01:11:01] <blackkbot> yeah a few functions have a bunch of different names but they all do the same thing
[01:11:03] <Cork> blackkbot: jquery-migrate is there for compatibility with old sites
[01:11:04] <blackkbot> right?
[01:11:22] <Cork> blackkbot: yes, cause the alias doesn't have a cost of keeping around
[01:11:36] <blackkbot> except it has a cost of having to know all the aliases
[01:11:42] <Cork> and breaking compatibility just for the fun of it isn't a good idea for a framework
[01:12:07] <Cork> blackkbot: the cost of having to know the aliases when you edit an old site
[01:12:13] <Cork> vs having to rewrite all old sites
[01:12:20] <Cork> i would say knowing the alias wins hands down
[01:12:28] <blackkbot> yeah but 1 alias is fine
[01:12:46] <Cork> blackkbot: do you have an example of what you have so much problem with here?
[01:12:52] <Cork> cause i really don't see it
[01:13:48] <jikuja> damn. Is there currently anyone with access to repos and knowledge how to edit xmls?
[01:14:02] <jikuja> oh and wrong  channel
[01:14:22] <blackkbot> no its all jquery code i deal with... i know javascript like the back of my hand but when i mess with jquery im constantly flipping through the api for functions that don't have good explanations or are unclear on where they belong in the api
[01:14:56] <Cork> blackkbot: uh, you're quite close to trolling right now
[01:15:05] <Cork> if you can't even give an example of what the problem is
[01:15:23] <blackkbot> idk i just want the api to be cleaner or something sorry tho
[01:15:47] <Cork> there is a cost to every decision you make in a framework
[01:15:53] <Cork> same for the dom api
[01:15:56] <blackkbot> this is true
[01:16:20] <Cork> and if you follow the es6 development you would know they struggle with this a lot too
[01:16:31] <blackkbot> yeah
[01:16:46] <Cork> (they had to drop .contains as a generic way to search cause of web compatibility just a few days ago)
[01:17:50] <blackkbot> yeah and the new => function expression
[01:18:05] <blackkbot> isn't valid old js so it would throw an exception and prevent old code from working
[01:18:17] <blackkbot> err in old browsers
[01:18:24] <blackkbot> new code old browsers
[01:19:01] <blackkbot> and yeah i know jquery was around before javascript got good so they built functions like .each
[01:19:08] <blackkbot> or every
[01:19:11] <blackkbot> idk what it is
[03:32:34] <BluyBrink> hi all, does anybody know a plugin that would implement an user interface on tip of local browser storage, that would allow storage and management of strings in a hierarchical structure? I would like to let user create and store queries in a way similar to the Postman tool
[03:33:37] <BluyBrink> I mean the UI side, I know how to store the actual data
[03:59:00] <theweirdn8> LOL off topic; but this is hilarious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0H6AzEMHSc
[04:07:56] <steveccc> is there a way to just change the end of a string. I am doing a detect on image tags that end in .svg and ideally I just want to replace svg with png - would you just use .replace?
[04:08:15] <_rgn> sure
[04:08:58] <dni> v
[04:09:46] <Cork> steveccc: .replace(/svg$/, 'png')
[04:10:13] <steveccc> cork: whats the $ - does that mean ends with?
[04:10:19] <Cork> steveccc: regex
[04:10:58] <steveccc> cork - will give it a try - thanks
[04:11:09] <Cork> steveccc: http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html
[04:15:41] <steveccc> cork: if its working then I should see the svg to png change in view source shouldn't i?
[04:16:02] <Cork> steveccc: .replace returns the modified string
[04:16:06] <Cork> it doesn't change it
[04:16:22] <Cork> so if you modify a dom element you have to set it again
[04:16:34] <steveccc> cork: oh ok sorry - thanks
[04:16:40] <Cork> steveccc: also not that chrome doesn't fire load events twice on an img element
[04:16:46] <Cork> so things might break there
[04:17:02] <Cork> *also note
[04:17:43] <Cork> meaning img onerror > change src > nothing
[04:18:07] <Cork> instead of img onerror > change src > img onload (that none webkit browsers do)
[04:29:29] <hanmac1> hey i have a list of "input[type='number']" elements and i would like to have the values turned into an array/string like "val1,val2,val3" i used the map function, then get and than join but i was looking if there are shorter ideas for that
[04:30:09] <Cork> hanmac1: no that is most likely the shortest form
[04:30:32] <hanmac1> ah damit, but its okay i can deal with it ...
[04:30:36] <Cork> there is $.serialize and $.serializeArray, but those won't give you a result like that
[04:31:48] <Cork> hanmac1: but you are doing $.map($("input[type='number']", function(elm) { return elm.value; }).join(',') right?
[04:32:06] <Cork> it doesn't get much shorter then that
[04:33:35] <hanmac1> hm yeah but i need .find and not the global $() so i dont think it might get any shorter (but good that i can get over the get() )
[04:34:12] <Cork> ya, you have to loop the elements one way or another
[04:52:19] <hanmac1> Cork: hm i remember in some gem for ruby there was a way using css/xpath selectors to only get the attribute elements of an list of nodes ... but i dont think that would be nicer for jquery (and it still might not help me in a way)
[04:53:28] <d0de> I have a lib written in the revealing module pattern. What's a good way to return the private methods for unit testing?
[05:00:37] <jemendja> hello
[05:06:15] <d0de> well after searching around the answer seems to be "don't test private methods", which suits me just fine!
[05:12:16] <vsgill> Hi guys, I'm trying to get a select box to open when I click a button, but the solution I found online only works in chrome
[05:12:18] <vsgill> any idea?
[05:14:58] <Cork> vsgill: as far as i know you can't do that in the standards
[05:15:46] <vsgill> bum. That sucks
[05:16:11] <Cork> so you would have to rely on bugs and browsers specific implmentations
[05:16:27] <Cork> vsgill: much about form elements sucks
[05:16:57] <vsgill> hah, thanks anyway
[05:26:37] <neuromute9> curious why $(window).resize(function(){} is firing when I move around in a mobile browser, this isn't normal is it
[05:26:38] <neuromute9> ?
[05:32:35] <gtristan> I'm pretty sure I read some documentation yesterday on how to connect to an event using a selector, in such a way that the handler will be called if the selector reports something at the time of event triggering (even if the selector does not return anything at the time of event connection)
[05:32:44] <gtristan> but I can't find that anymore, am I dreaming ?
[05:36:30] <Cork> gtristan: delegate
[05:36:40] <Cork> ?g api.jquery delegate
[05:36:41] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[05:52:37] <gtristan> Cork, ah that was it, thanks !
[05:53:10] <Cork> gtristan: if you missed it, note that .on with the delegate syntax is preferred now days
[05:53:30] <Cork> but the delegate page does a better job explaining delegation
[05:54:20] <gtristan> I see
[05:54:47] <gtristan> I admit that it's sort of a hack in the first place to want to use the .delegate() behavior anyway
[05:55:01] <gtristan> I prefer everything explicit, just wanted to test something quickly
[05:55:04] <Cork> gtristan: actually .delegate isn't a hack
[05:55:26] <gtristan> no, but the fact I needed to connect to something and not know the right time to do it, was a hack ;-)
[05:55:28] <Cork> it is actually often the preferred way to do it if you want to have many elements with the same action
[05:55:32] <Cork> ah
[05:56:01] <Cork> anyway "as delegated event handlers is more preferment in those situations"
[06:07:11] <sniperh4x0r> anyone know why my p tags go over my img tags? http://erictheprogrammer.com/pinterest/
[06:07:21] <sniperh4x0r> it only happens on some of them for some reason
[06:07:32] <sniperh4x0r> and if you refresh the page it changes
[06:08:35] <Cork> sniperh4x0r: works fine here
[06:08:48] <Cork> (chrome and firefox, desktop browser)
[06:09:01] <sniperh4x0r> chrome for me is screwed hmm
[06:09:01] <xec_> maybe the images are loaded after the positioning is set
[06:10:06] <sniperh4x0r> Oh, try hard refreshing
[06:10:10] <sniperh4x0r> then you will probably see the issue
[06:10:12] <xec_> sniperh4x0r: try putting the code in $(window).load(function(){....}); instead of the normal doc ready, see if that does anything
[06:10:55] <Cork> ah, ya connection speed most likely is the cause
[06:11:03] <Cork> (i'm on a VERY fast connection)
[06:11:06] <Erwat> hey Cork, i'm gonna ask a stupid question that you don't need to try to answer in depth
[06:11:15] <Erwat> so i'm having these fish swimming around
[06:11:30] <Cork> fish??
[06:11:40] <Erwat> they are div elements; they have a spritesheet animation done via css background-position and they are moved via the css transform keyword
[06:11:47] <Cork> ah
[06:11:58] <xec_> lol i thought you were talking about actual fish
[06:12:01] <Erwat> now i have a samsung galaxy tab sm-t525 and a oneplus one
[06:12:12] <sniperh4x0r> xec_: that's what i orignally had but if i do that all the items are in the same column on page load
[06:12:15] <sniperh4x0r> which i'm trying to avoid
[06:12:24] <Erwat> they both have the same cpu and gpu, both are using the same version of chrome; tablet is using android 4.4.2, phone is using android 4.4.4
[06:12:34] <Erwat> tablet runs that same thing at 60 fps, the phone runs it at 5
[06:12:53] <Cork> Erwat: same hardware?
[06:13:00] <Cork> meaning same cpu and gpu?
[06:13:14] <Cork> cause that normally make a BIG difference
[06:13:49] <Cork> especially older arm processors suck really bad
[06:14:11] <Erwat> tablet has a qualcomm snapdragon 800: cpu quad-core 2.3GHz Krait 400
[06:14:21] <Erwat> phone has a qualcomm snapdragon 800: cpu quad-core 2.5GHz Krait 400
[06:14:32] <Erwat> tablet has an andreno 330 gpu, phone has an adreno 330 gpu
[06:14:47] <Cork> hmm
[06:14:56] <Cork> Erwat: don't have a good answer then
[06:15:00] <Erwat> sorry phone is running snapdragon 801
[06:15:06] <Cork> time for some performance profiling
[06:15:09] <Erwat> well, the fps difference is 5 vs 60; that's HUGE
[06:15:14] <Cork> ya
[06:15:19] <Erwat> like this doesn't seem to be related to anything that should normally happen
[06:15:20] <Cork> but it can be small things causing it
[06:15:33] <Erwat> so would it be okay to assume for now that it's some driver or android bug? (4.4.4 vs 4.4.2)
[06:15:39] <xec_> sniperh4x0r: that doesn't make a lot of sense?
[06:15:45] <Cork> like something causes an image to scale and slow things down just as an example
[06:15:48] <xec_> sniperh4x0r: why would it do that
[06:15:51] <Cork> anyway got to run
[06:16:19] <Erwat> okay, thanks. take care!
[06:16:59] <sniperh4x0r> xec_: my jquery is positioning each item, so before it runs (before the window.load) as the page reneder you see all the items on top of each other becuase they are position absolute. Then when they jquery finishes running they go into their proper positions.
[06:17:21] <sniperh4x0r> sorry for my terrible spelling
[06:17:33] <xec> sniperh4x0r: yes, but it would do the same on doc ready as on load, no?
[06:17:59] <sniperh4x0r> i wasn't doing it in doc ready before
[06:18:05] <sniperh4x0r> well i never had it in a doc ready
[06:18:29] <sniperh4x0r> i had it in a normal jquery function "$(function(){"
[06:18:36] <xec> sniperh4x0r: yes thats a shorthand
[06:18:55] <xec> sniperh4x0r: $(func) is the same as $(document).ready(func)
[06:19:02] <sniperh4x0r> oh ok
[06:19:47] <sniperh4x0r> well i guess my question now is how do i get it to run before the page renders?
[06:19:59] <xec> that's what you're doing not
[06:20:00] <xec> now*
[06:20:05] <xec> and what's causing the issue
[06:20:33] <xec> well, doc ready means the DOM is done constructing, on load includes scripts ran and images loaded
[06:21:14] <xec> if you try to calculate positioning relative to the size of the images you need to know their sizes first (i.e. after load)
[06:21:29] <sniperh4x0r> i see that is what i originally figured
[06:21:50] <sniperh4x0r> by my co-worker said i had access to image sizes before they've even loaded
[06:21:52] <sniperh4x0r> which threw me off
[06:21:56] <sniperh4x0r> thanks for the help
[06:22:20] <xec> sniperh4x0r: if the <img> tag includes the height and width attributes you do
[06:24:29] <sniperh4x0r> let me get this clear in my head: doc.ready happens before window.load ?
[06:24:39] <sniperh4x0r> and doc.ready is the fastest your jquery can run?
[06:24:54] <sniperh4x0r> but only happens after rendering on the browser is finished?
[06:25:12] <Kingsy> I am having a strange problem in which a touchup event (I assume thats what its called.. when someone takes their finger off the screen) is collapsing a menu. I can find the code that is being executed which causes it to hide at all.. is tehre a way to disable the "touchoff" event altogether? we don't need or use it
[06:27:16] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: `ready` happens when you can manipulate the DOM.
[06:29:24] <sniperh4x0r> BillCriswell: right, but is there any way to have javascript run before anything on the page has loaded?
[06:29:40] <sniperh4x0r> it seems to run as the page is loaded, always.
[06:30:17] <xec> sniperh4x0r: of course, but you can't access a DOM that doesn't exist, and you can't rely on images being loaded until onload
[06:30:45] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: Just running JS in the head will run immediately, but you won't be able to mess with the DOM .
[06:30:52] <xec> sniperh4x0r: if you want something to run immediately just don't put it inside $(function(){...});
[06:32:02] <xec> in your case you have included the script tags at the end of the HTML which means the browser will construct (and render) it before the script is run
[06:32:45] <sniperh4x0r> ok it's clear now, thanks guys
[06:34:19] <Kingsy> ah screw this.. I am writing the function.. its horrible
[06:54:51] <latestbot> Anyone familiar with QUnit?
[07:02:20] <reynierpm> hi and morning to everyone I need to convert a string date from this format YYYY-MM-DD to DD/MM/YYYY and I am using MomentJS for this but can not get it to work see my code here http://jsbin.com/bepawazube/1/edit?js,console,output can any give me a help?
[07:08:13] <sniperh4x0r> how do i make an asynchronous .each() function in jquery?
[07:08:50] <mbrzuzy> .each is asynchronous by default
[07:10:42] <sniperh4x0r> mbrzuzy: i think it's synchronous by default
[07:10:42] <sniperh4x0r> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7371942/is-jquery-each-function-synchronous
[07:12:32] <mbrzuzy> Sorry, here is an answer that may clarify
[07:12:36] <mbrzuzy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2358205/invoking-a-jquery-function-after-each-has-completed
[07:17:13] <notchris> Hey everyone
[07:17:14] <Macaveli> Is it normall that you can't do window.location.href in jsfiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/n0gy29sg/
[07:21:39] <sniperh4x0r> thanks mbrzuzy
[07:21:53] <sniperh4x0r> anyone know of a way to learn jquery that is similar to what smarterer.com does?
[07:29:43] <bbclover> hey guys, if I want to move this <a> tag a certain amount of pixels to the right, how would I do that?
[07:29:53] <bbclover> right now it's just chilling all the way left like regular
[07:30:31] <Biwaa> bbclover: add a left value ?
[07:30:46] <bbclover> Biwaa: yeah, how? haha
[07:31:50] <bbclover> using offset?
[07:32:23] <Biwaa> style="left: 35px"
[07:32:51] <Biwaa> but it's easier for me to help you with some lines of code :)
[07:33:04] <Biwaa> and it's css and not javascript
[07:33:54] <bbclover> Biwaa: well I have this continuescrolling <a> tag and I want it to keep moving the same amount as my scrollbar so I can continue clicking it to scroll
[07:34:45] <bbclover> so I just want to know how I can keep adding to it's left
[07:35:19] <cjohnson> position: fixed
[07:36:29] <bbclover> cjohnson: would that mess with it's position relative to everything else though?
[07:36:35] <bbclover> or would it just stay left?
[07:39:24] <ravigehlot> I have an $.each() that is pulling photos from an API. We are pulling about 8 photos. What we want to do is show a spinner while that $.each loops over all 8 photos and then when it is done, we want it to hide the spinner. How can that we accomplished?
[07:40:19] <bbclover> hey guys, this click event I wrote is only scrolling once: http://pastebin.com/jqEq6Lmp any idea?
[07:41:11] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Is #contScroll being recreated?
[07:42:00] <bbclover> nope, just checked by $('[id="contScroll"]').length and got 1
[07:42:00] <cjohnson> bbclover: it would float it in a fixed position relative to your viewport no matter where you scroll
[07:42:01] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: You want to wait for the images to load as well?
[07:42:06] <bbclover> if I scrollback to the left I can do it again once
[07:42:24] <bbclover> cjohnson: yeah it looks good, thanks
[07:42:29] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Ok.
[07:42:51] <cjohnson> bbclover: just because that .length is 1 doesn't mean the node hasn't been destroyed and re-created since the time of binding
[07:43:02] <cjohnson> put a console.log in your event handler and make sure it's being fired
[07:43:08] <bbclover> k
[07:43:20] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: that would be great...
[07:43:45] <cjohnson> ravigehlot: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2358205/invoking-a-jquery-function-after-each-has-completed
[07:44:06] <Kingsy> can someone think of a way to binding a toggle event to an element when it is inside of a parent that is display:none ?
[07:44:14] <cjohnson> you could use some sort of deferred/promise interface but that seems overkill for this situation
[07:44:40] <bbclover> cjohnson: it fires everytime I click, but only scrolls the first time
[07:44:42] <cjohnson> Kingsy: don't. just bind it always and then check its position inside the event handler
[07:44:43] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/ this is helpful
[07:45:03] <Kingsy> cjohnson: what do you mean?
[07:45:10] <BillCriswell> Just show the spinner right before the loop, then have the done callback hide it.
[07:45:41] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: right
[07:45:43] <cjohnson> Kingsy: instead of if(condition) { $('#someNode').click(function() ... ) }
[07:45:45] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: that is what I want to do
[07:45:53] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: how do I do that callback?
[07:45:55] <cjohnson> Kingsy: do $('#someNode').click(function() { if(condition) { ... }})
[07:46:22] <cjohnson> ravigehlot: read the docs for .hide
[07:46:29] <BillCriswell> ravigehlot: http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/ has examples
[07:46:30] <cjohnson> to hide the spinner
[07:46:45] <Kingsy> cjohnson: ah makes more sense.
[07:46:53] <Kingsy> so it does bind regardless of its display state
[07:47:05] <cjohnson> exactly, then you check the display state inside the handler
[07:47:28] <BillCriswell> $('.some-container').imagesLoaded().done(function () { /* fuck yeah loaded! */ });
[07:51:13] <bbclover> when I do $('.cPanel').scrollLeft(); I get 0 every time, even after the initial scroll
[07:51:22] <bbclover> when I feel like it should be whatever I add...
[07:51:45] <bbclover> I mean it scrolls so why is scrollLeft still 0
[07:51:54] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Are you actually scrolling .cPanel or are you scrolling body and .cPanel is moving left?
[07:52:16] <bbclover> well I have this scrollbar and it seems to be cPanel
[07:52:35] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Make sure of it.
[07:52:58] <bbclover> why would it scroll though if it wasn't?
[07:53:05] <bbclover> propagation or something?
[07:53:54] <sniperh4x0r> someone know how to get each div to fadeOut after one another using .each? http://jsfiddle.net/qpzd6s7j/2/
[07:53:57] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You need to make sure it's the element .cPanel that is actually scrolling.
[07:54:11] <bbclover> but something did scroll initially
[07:54:33] <cjohnson> sniperh4x0r: trigger the next item's fadeOut from the previous one's done callback
[07:55:21] <BillCriswell> You can't use words like "something", you have to know that cPanel is the element that's scrolling for .scrollLeft() to report correctly.
[07:55:41] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Something tells me you want offset().left, but take a look at this: http://jsbin.com/polodivozu/1/edit?html,js,output
[07:55:42] <sniperh4x0r> cjohnson: i don't want to do it that way
[07:55:49] <cjohnson> sniperh4x0r: why
[07:55:50] <sniperh4x0r> shouldn't the setTimeout work?
[07:56:05] <cjohnson> sure, it will fire the .each, and then trigger several setTimeouts at the same time
[07:56:10] <cjohnson> which causes them to complete roughly at the same time
[07:56:18] <sniperh4x0r> oh i see
[07:56:23] <sniperh4x0r> how do i make them one after the other?
[07:56:29] <cjohnson> how I just told you
[07:56:45] <sniperh4x0r> ok then let me restructue my code to be more to what i actually want
[07:56:45] <cjohnson> if you want to explicitly wait between each one, you need to write code that explicitly waits between each one
[07:56:49] <sniperh4x0r> im not trying to do fadeouts
[07:56:53] <sniperh4x0r> rather im doing css
[07:57:01] <sniperh4x0r> like change them all to blue on after the other
[07:57:13] <sniperh4x0r> i dont think css has a fadeout callback?
[07:57:27] <cjohnson> css color changes are instant
[07:57:35] <cjohnson> so there would be no real point to doing them one after another
[07:57:44] <BillCriswell> There's a callback for transitionEnd or something sniperh4x0r.
[07:58:15] <cjohnson> you could also just use setTimeout with increasing wait values if that's all you mean
[08:00:06] <bbclover> BillCriswell: is there a way I can check what has scrollLeft 215 right now on the page since that's what I did somewhere to something?
[08:00:14] <bbclover> to find out what really scrolled
[08:00:36] <sniperh4x0r> cjohnson: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/qpzd6s7j/3/
[08:00:38] <bbclover> I mean the code makes me think cPanel is what scrolled 215...
[08:00:40] <sniperh4x0r> don't know why that doesn't work though
[08:00:57] <BillCriswell> bbclover: $('*').filter(function () { return $(this).scrollLeft() === 215; });
[08:00:59] <cjohnson> well, it doesn't work because you have a syntax error
[08:01:04] <cjohnson> but once you fix your error, that will work just fine
[08:01:18] <cjohnson> assuming you want to wait 300 ms and then change all of the elements backgrounds
[08:01:47] <cjohnson> oh wait $(this) is wrong. this is different inside your anonymous function you give to setTimeout
[08:01:50] <cjohnson> so you'll have to fix that too
[08:01:58] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: .each passes an index, so you can do like setTimeout(function () { }, 300 * index);
[08:02:13] <cjohnson> also it's $('div') not $(div)
[08:02:16] <bbclover> I typed it into my console but I don't know what to look for
[08:02:26] <bbclover> it has length 0
[08:02:34] <cjohnson> then nothing has scrollLeft === 215
[08:03:07] <bbclover> what the hell
[08:03:12] <sniperh4x0r> can you get it working for me?
[08:03:17] <sniperh4x0r> i cant seem to get it to work
[08:03:19] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: http://jsfiddle.net/qpzd6s7j/5/
[08:03:40] <sniperh4x0r> thanks BillCriswell
[08:03:58] <cjohnson> BillCriswell do you just hate learning? ;P
[08:04:01] <cjohnson> always giving people the answers
[08:04:20] <BillCriswell> I was typing that up before he asked for it haha
[08:04:23] <gtristan> does jquery offer any cross browser helper for the mutation observer events ?
[08:04:28] <BillCriswell> I wouldn't have given it if it was asked for.
[08:04:41] <BillCriswell> sniperh4x0r: For a better approach: http://www.paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[08:04:44] <bbclover> oh ok, I got it. I have length 1. How do I find out what the object is?
[08:04:52] <cjohnson> .get(0)
[08:05:23] <gtristan> cause it's a pretty sorry state, the old API is deprecated with crazy warnings on MDN saying dont use that, and the new DOM 4 API is only available in bleeding edge browsers, would be great to have a nice wrapper that just uses what's available
[08:05:39] <ravigehlot> BillCriswell: Thank you. I got it done.
[08:05:45] <ravigehlot> cjohnson: thanks for your help
[08:05:51] <cjohnson> no prob
[08:06:09] <bbclover> it is cPanel.. but when I call $('.cPanel').scrollLeft() I get 0
[08:06:28] <bbclover> I just added .get(0); at the end of of .filter()
[08:07:09] <cjohnson> instead of .get(0) put .scrollLeft()
[08:07:11] <cjohnson> I bet you don't get 0
[08:07:14] <gtristan> hmm, this looks like not a bad alternative actually: http://damien.antipa.at/2012/08/20/how-to-detect-dom-manipulations-with-jquery/
[08:07:22] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Do it in your console instead of in the script. You might be requesting the scrollLeft before it's scrolled.
[08:07:35] <gtristan> as I can pretty much guarantee that any mutations I'm interested in, are being done with jQuery APIs that we call
[08:08:16] <bbclover> yeah, I'm doing it in my console
[08:08:26] <cjohnson> seems like a terrible assumption to make but as long as you control all of the codebase and can dictate that DOM is only done through jquery...I guess
[08:08:42] <bbclover> I did that filter and got length 1 and it said cPanel was the object when I added the .get(0)
[08:08:46] <sniperh4x0r> BillCriswell: why did you have to make a variable for $(this)? shouldn't it have worked with just using $(this)?
[08:08:54] <bbclover> but calling scrollLeft() on cPanel I get 0
[08:08:59] <cjohnson> sniperh4x0r: the inner function() {} changes what "this" means
[08:09:13] <cjohnson> "this" is relative to the function() {} it's contained within
[08:09:15] <sniperh4x0r> oh i see
[08:09:30] <gtristan> cjohnson, yeah, well it wouldnt work for stuff that any plugins do, but we've sandboxed how we do DOM manipulation already pretty well so, it could be a decent option I think
[08:09:50] <sniperh4x0r> i also don't understand what i's value is
[08:09:54] <sniperh4x0r> when that gets called to the function
[08:09:58] <cjohnson> it's the index of the array
[08:10:08] <sniperh4x0r> oh ok
[08:10:11] <sniperh4x0r> thanks
[08:10:14] <cjohnson> .each calls function(index, value)
[08:10:20] <cjohnson> er value, index, whichever the case may be
[08:10:50] <cjohnson> gtristan: still seems like a pretty major assumption... and then yeah you're hoping that no third party code anywhere makes non-jqueyr DOM changes
[08:11:07] <cjohnson> plus it will be non-trivial to determine which mutations happened based on jquery function calls
[08:11:23] <gtristan> cjohnson, yeah, I'm hoping to do without the need anyway
[08:11:30] <cjohnson> chances are you're solving the wrong problem anyway
[08:11:35] <cjohnson> what are you trying to do
[08:11:53] <gtristan> cjohnson, we do a lot of templating though, building composite JS objects bound to mini DOM trees and recursively slapping them together
[08:12:20] <cjohnson> if you control this all anyway you'd do better to just trigger events explicitly
[08:12:23] <cjohnson> instead of listening for DOM changes
[08:12:34] <gtristan> today it struck me that I would be interested to know, from the POV of a nested component, when I'm 'anchored' into the actual page
[08:12:42] <gtristan> indeed
[08:12:46] <gtristan> I thought of that too
[08:13:00] <gtristan> with trigger and on and such
[08:13:06] <cjohnson> yeah. much better approach
[08:49:22] <rglen> is there a way to pass en event object into a function ?  I'm sure this is elementary, but I'm new to javascript & jquery.   Scoping seems to be my issue.
[08:49:40] <robertmaxrees> rglen are you using .on()?
[08:50:03] <robertmaxrees> because if so, yes - $('.myThing').on('click', function(e) { console.log(e) });
[08:50:12] <robertmaxrees> or whatever you want to name the object.
[08:50:52] <rglen> I was here's what I was trying
[08:51:09] <rglen> http://pastebin.com/Hu1ZWLXF
[08:51:48] <rglen> problem is e is undefined to the bootbox portion
[08:51:51] <robertmaxrees> e is available there.
[08:52:02] <robertmaxrees> should be, at least.
[08:52:14] <robertmaxrees> you could always do something like var myEvent = e; then use myEvent instead.
[08:52:14] <robertmaxrees> brb
[08:53:21] <rglen> I'll try that
[08:54:56] <robertmaxrees> but that shouldn't matter, since the event handler closure should take care of everything for you.
[08:55:26] <tonph> hi I am in situation trying to access a dom element that is rendered by an ajax call, but its not able to do so. Any ideas.. how to
[08:55:52] <reynierpm> how do I set a var to its default value from different scripts all loaded on the same page? something like http://jsbin.com/fimayebolu/1/edit?js,console,output
[08:55:55] <reynierpm> is this possible?
[08:57:10] <tonph> I have a function that does an ajax call and rendered a html using $('#mydivid').html(response), and after the function return I want to access an element which was rendered dynamicall
[08:58:15] <BillCriswell> tonph: You can attach the event listeners after that line, or you can use event delegation.
[08:58:50] <BillCriswell> $('#mydivid').on('click', '.some-new-element', function () { /* Whatever */ });
[09:00:39] <ServerCrash> hi, i am trying to use flexImages plugin http://goodies.pixabay.com/jquery/flex-images/demo.html . I have loaded ajax data and added new elements in to page. How can apply or refresh the flexImages plugin on the newly added domelements.
[09:01:00] <tonph> BillCriswell: its like fetch_listing() function does an ajax call, now after I make a call to fetch_listing(), I have a line of code $('#mydivid') ... which was rendered dynamically
[09:01:14] <tonph> now I can see its undefined...
[09:02:23] <tonph> looks like dur to ajax call before the .html() occured, the next line was executed ie. #('#mydiv') is undefined..
[09:02:25] <ServerCrash> currently the flexImages plugin only applies its effects on existing domelements in the given div, if  i add new elements in the div the changes i not applied to new ones
[09:02:48] <decx> man i hate all ecommerce systems
[09:02:52] <robertmaxrees> tonph any code that relies on the ajax call finishing needs to be in the .done() callback
[09:02:55] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[09:03:06] <decx> hat is such a strong word though, they're all hitler
[09:03:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, if I can't get it done in Shopify I'm not doing it.
[09:03:30] <ServerCrash> i tried to check .on and .live but i guess they are for button related function like click etc
[09:03:37] <BillCriswell> At least on my own.
[09:03:40] <decx> i thought magento was better but it's just a terrible as oxid
[09:03:49] <robertmaxrees> decx we tried magento.
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> it was.... special.
[09:03:52] <BillCriswell> decx: magento is terrifying.
[09:03:58] <decx> shopify isn't ready for germany sadly
[09:04:01] <decx> out of the box
[09:04:03] <robertmaxrees> ServerCrash .on() is for everything events.
[09:04:05] <tonph> robertmaxrees: how done may helpl
[09:04:06] <BillCriswell> decx: Aw, bummer.
[09:04:18] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ tonph
[09:04:18] <b-ot> tonph: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:04:36] <ServerCrash> robertmaxrees : i can i apply .on for change in dom content?
[09:04:42] <ServerCrash> robertmaxrees : how can i apply .on for change in dom content?
[09:04:50] <decx> you trigger a custom event
[09:04:50] <robertmaxrees> ServerCrash in that case you want a mutation observer
[09:04:57] <robertmaxrees> ^ or custom events
[09:05:04] <decx> mutator is weird
[09:05:11] <ServerCrash> i thought of customevent
[09:05:11] <robertmaxrees> or explicitly call your logic instead of messing with an event.
[09:05:22] <robertmaxrees> just call your code explicitly.
[09:05:25] <ServerCrash> mutation observer doesnt work in IE i guess
[09:05:25] <robertmaxrees> why is that a problem?
[09:05:26] <decx> right if you dont need an element then that
[09:13:22] <tonph> http://jsfiddle.net/mLzd11yt/1/
[09:13:55] <tonph> hi code looks like something.. its not the working .. its smething like this
[09:14:50] <cjohnson> Is the code unemployed?
[09:15:13] <tonph> its not like that ... i m just in the development phase... :(
[09:15:24] <decx> where's url coming from?
[09:15:53] <decx> also $('#editpopup').innerHTML
[09:16:01] <decx> that aint happening
[09:16:24] <decx> and why the ''+result
[09:16:30] <tonph> the showPopup will be accepting the proper arguments.. there is no prob with ajax call..
[09:16:58] <cjohnson> and id_ in your show function is undefined
[09:17:25] <cjohnson> and...why are you doing .html() in one line but .innerHTML = in the other?
[09:18:26] <tonph> think of the code is Perfetly working, the fiddle i am just trying to explain my prob.. :)
[09:18:34] <bruce927> I've never used jquery (or js for that matter), but I think it will be best to do what I want, which is poll a php file every x which outputs some json and then display the parsed output
[09:18:48] <decx> that's what i'm telling my clients if they find a bug
[09:18:56] <decx> "think of your shop working perfectly"
[09:19:02] <tonph> please just take all the param and the functions perfectly working
[09:19:56] <robertmaxrees> tonph put whatever code that relies on the ajax finishing in the success callback.
[09:20:31] <bruce927> Will jquery be suitable for that?
[09:20:53] <tonph> k let me try ..
[09:20:54] <robertmaxrees> bruce927 jquery can help with the ajax portion of that, sure.
[09:21:01] <robertmaxrees> tonph jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mLzd11yt/2/
[09:21:35] <bruce927> robertmaxrees: The PHP is written and displaying the json fine, so it is basically just the polling/turning it into a usable html page
[09:21:56] <robertmaxrees> bruce927 the "html page" part is separate.
[09:22:18] <robertmaxrees> jquery has a pretty good abstraction for working with ajax that a lot of people find helpful.
[09:30:59] <fernand__> hello
[09:31:09] <fernand__> I need help with jquerymobile
[09:31:46] <fernand__> anyone ?
[09:33:05] <fernand__> I need help with jquerymobile
[09:33:06] <_lazarevs> hey guys
[09:33:15] <_lazarevs> I need you jquery expertise
[09:33:34] <_lazarevs> up until I've kept my data in a hashset
[09:33:46] <_lazarevs> and whenever the user clicked a button I used to 'pop()' the next question from the list
[09:33:53] <_lazarevs> however, now the order of the questions should be randomised
[09:34:02] <_lazarevs> so pop() will no longer work
[09:34:13] <_lazarevs> so I have a hash of key:value pair objects
[09:34:26] <_lazarevs> I want to, at random, remove one of the elements and return it
[09:34:33] <_lazarevs> what's the best, most efficient way to do that in jquery
[09:34:42] <_lazarevs> I feel like there's a baked-in method which I am not aware of..
[09:34:44] <_lazarevs> thanks
[09:35:12] <decx> randomize your questions beforehand in a separate array and pop from there
[09:35:32] <_lazarevs> wait.. can I pop() from an array too?!
[09:35:36] <devslash> this is my code http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/2/ I want to use a transition effect when the black drawer loses focus. why isnt this working ?
[09:35:48] <devslash> yes
[09:35:55] <decx> well you cant pop from an object so i dont know where you're popping from ^^
[09:35:55] <devslash> arrays support push and pop
[09:36:09] <_lazarevs> you guys have beautiful minds
[09:36:10] <_lazarevs> :*
[09:36:12] <NoiseEee> _lazarevs: what were you pop'ing from?!
[09:36:12] <_lazarevs> thanks!!
[09:36:39] <_lazarevs> NoiseEee: oh fair enough.. it's an array made up of JSONs
[09:36:41] <_lazarevs> i feel so stupid
[09:36:41] <_lazarevs> :(
[09:36:46] <decx> shift & popa ... aaaw pop it... p p p pop it
[09:36:59] <_lazarevs> o/-<
[09:37:50] <decx> devslash i think only form element support focusout
[09:38:16] <devslash> i tried blur as well
[09:38:21] <fernand__> I have an issue with jquerymobile... it shows a bar on top of ul li items
[09:41:58] <fernand__> if I use data-inset="false" it hides it but the menu shows from edge to edge
[09:42:12] <fernand__> C
[09:42:47] <fernand__> anyone
[09:42:47] <fernand__> ?
[09:43:38] <fernand__> it shows a white bar for each li item using data-inset="true"
[09:48:31] <fernand__> quit
[10:14:15] <pll> hey guys, need a suggestion here; lets say i have <li>it1</li> <li>it2</li> .. <li>it5<//li> ... I want to find the one that has the id=selected and then move to the next <li> in the list and selected/execute that one
[10:14:37] <latestbot> Use .each to loop through li’s
[10:14:38] <cjohnson> $('#selected').next()
[10:14:40] <pll> is there a way to do that with jquery, I know I can return the active one, how would reference the next one in the list??
[10:14:46] <robertmaxrees> .next()
[10:14:56] <pll> merci, researching

[11:01:23] <aracodex123> hi anyone here?
[11:09:57] <devslash> hi
[11:10:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:11:30] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain what's your question?
[11:14:16] <devslash> why is this jquery event never getting triggered ? http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/3/
[11:15:09] <robertmaxrees> devslash the inline handler might be part of it.
[11:15:40] <devslash> which inline handler
[11:16:24] <robertmaxrees> the javascript: if() href value
[11:16:45] <devslash> hih
[11:16:48] <devslash> huh ?
[11:16:59] <devslash> what are you talknig about
[11:17:44] <notchris> I’m trying to collapse / open some panels. http://pastebin.com/zx7yG1E8
[11:17:52] <notchris> I set the data-target to the div I wanted to affect
[11:18:08] <robertmaxrees> devslash hold up - i'm seeing that alert fire.
[11:18:11] <notchris> I set that to var x, the data target of each button
[11:18:29] <BillCriswell> notchris: `this`  is probably not what you think it is.
[11:18:42] <notchris> @BillCriswell That’s true
[11:19:04] <notchris> Here’s why I’m confused
[11:19:14] <BillCriswell> Ok
[11:19:18] <notchris> x = $(this).data("target");
[11:19:28] <notchris> I set x to the data target of this, correct?
[11:19:31] <notchris> in general
[11:19:44] <BillCriswell> notchris: What are you expect this to be in your code though?
[11:19:53] <notchris> $(".thebutton").click(){ $(x).collapse(); }
[11:20:07] <notchris> Each button with the class .thebutton has a different data target that references a DIV
[11:20:20] <devslash> robertmaxrees, the alert isnt firing for me
[11:20:27] <notchris> So I figured it would be like
[11:20:40] <robertmaxrees> devslash could you clarify what you actually want?
[11:20:42] <BillCriswell> notchris: `this` is not what you think it is.
[11:20:48] <notchris> “Click the button, take the data target (which is the id of a div), do something to the div
[11:20:52] <BillCriswell> I need to know what you think it is.
[11:20:54] <devslash> robertmaxrees, well id like the event to fire for 1 thing
[11:21:00] <robertmaxrees> devslash what'
[11:21:04] <notchris> I think THIS is the data-target of each button
[11:21:07] <robertmaxrees> *what's the "1 thing"?
[11:21:10] <notchris> Which is referencing a div
[11:21:12] <devslash> robertmaxrees, I want the fricking event to trigger
[11:21:24] <notchris> <a data-target="#west" class="btn btn-primary thebutton">View Directions from West of Hartford</a>
[11:21:43] <notchris> Then I have a div with the ID west somehere I want to do something to
[11:21:44] <robertmaxrees> devslash that's not helpful.  when do you expect focusout to trigger in this case?
[11:21:45] <devslash> i am going to have the drawer disappear using transitional css
[11:21:49] <BillCriswell> notchris: this outside of that click event is the window. You don't want that.
[11:22:15] <robertmaxrees> devslash so you're tring to make it so that when you click anywhere outside of the nav, it closes?
[11:22:20] <devslash> yea
[11:22:29] <notchris> so $(this) is relative to location of the script?
[11:22:36] <notchris> Where it is in the script
[11:22:46] <robertmaxrees> devslash use an event listener on the document instead.
[11:22:50] <decx> notchris go through your buttons on load on put an actual element instead of a hash string in some data()
[11:22:52] <BillCriswell> notchris: Yes, `this` is special in Javascript.
[11:23:05] <devslash> how
[11:23:18] <devslash> i thought that focusout was an event listener
[11:23:25] <pll> hey guys, playing with next() - when I get to the second last element of the <li> im going through, I want it to go back to the first <li> item.   whats the easiest way to do that? Tried a couple ways here and it seems glitchy at times
[11:23:27] <robertmaxrees> devslash it is, but it's not the event you want.
[11:23:37] <devslash> then what event do i need to use
[11:24:44] <robertmaxrees> one on document
[11:25:01] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/nfhd0gk/
[11:25:04] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this
[11:25:13] <devslash> you mean the javascript event listener instead of jquerys event listener ?
[11:25:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:25:35] <robertmaxrees> you still use a jquery event listener.
[11:26:29] <devslash> still doesnt work
[11:26:38] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/4/
[11:26:40] <robertmaxrees> that's an example.
[11:26:47] <robertmaxrees> it's not a "copy paste and it'll work" think.
[11:26:49] <robertmaxrees> *thing
[11:26:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:27:01] <devslash> i didnt c&p
[11:27:05] <robertmaxrees> bind the listener to document for click.
[11:27:07] <robertmaxrees> like I had.
[11:27:11] <robertmaxrees> not to the nav
[11:27:23] <robertmaxrees> you want to listen to all clicks on the document and, if they're not in the nav, close it.
[11:27:30] <devslash> but i only want it to trigger for this 1 specific element
[11:27:42] <devslash> and not on click but focusout
[11:27:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to close the nav when you click outside of it.
[11:27:48] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[11:29:17] <BillCriswell> Chrome has been feeling funky today.
[11:31:09] <devslash> that does not work
[11:31:09] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/5/
[11:31:58] <robertmaxrees> devslash right.. because theNav isn't defined.
[11:32:30] <devslash> so can you show me how to make it work
[11:32:34] <devslash> i have no fcking idea
[11:32:40] <BillCriswell> notchris: http://jsbin.com/tuyoleyaka/1/edit?html,js,output here is how I'd typically approach something like that..
[11:32:43] <robertmaxrees> what aren't you clear on?
[11:32:50] <devslash> how to make it work
[11:32:54] <devslash> how to make it trigger
[11:33:08] <robertmaxrees> step through the handler.
[11:33:21] <devslash> why
[11:33:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:33:35] <robertmaxrees> because that's how you learn?
[11:33:44] <devslash> that wont help me understand anything
[11:33:53] <robertmaxrees> uh
[11:33:57] <robertmaxrees> sure it will.
[11:34:00] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: You don't need to know how things work to understand them.
[11:34:09] <devslash> no
[11:34:19] <devslash> can someone help me out here
[11:34:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:35:43] <BillCriswell> devslash: It looks like when there's a click anywhere on the document you want to check for an element inside your nav and do something if it exists. Right?
[11:36:17] <devslash> no i want to actually trigger an event when the black slide out drawer loses focus so i can make it close automatically
[11:36:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to trigger an event.
[11:36:29] <robertmaxrees> you want to bind to an event.
[11:40:35] <devslash> BillCriswell,is that possible?
[11:40:50] <robertmaxrees> welp
[11:41:26] <robertmaxrees> btw you're going to have some interesting headaches because of the way you chose to hide/show your nav.
[11:42:01] <bbclover> hey guys, why can't I do this?: $('*').filter(function () { return $(this).scrollLeft() === 245; }).get(0).scrollLeft();
[11:42:23] <bbclover> .get(0) will get me the object right?
[11:42:34] <robertmaxrees> .get() will get the underlying dom node.
[11:42:37] <robertmaxrees> you want .eq()
[11:42:37] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You probably want .eq(0)
[11:42:45] <robertmaxrees> though try to not use $('*')
[11:42:50] <NoiseEee> or first()
[11:42:56] <BillCriswell> but when you need the scrollLeft() when filtering by scrollLeft is a bit odd.
[11:43:14] <BillCriswell> I remember I was helping you quickly find whatever element had that.. but it doesn't mean you should be using it lol
[11:43:35] <notchris> @BillCriswell
[11:43:36] <bbclover> well when I do it on the said element.scrollLeft() I always get 0
[11:43:38] <notchris> http://pastebin.com/svx97y4t
[11:43:47] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/getting-here/
[11:43:51] <notchris> Cant seem to get it to work
[11:43:52] <notchris> :/
[11:43:56] <devslash> BillCriswell, so do you know how to do that ?
[11:44:24] <BillCriswell> devslash: Yes.
[11:44:46] <devslash> how ?
[11:44:55] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: when I do that filter and .get(0) I get <div class="cPanel" style="height: 720px;">...</div>. But when I do $('.cPanel').scrollLeft() I get 0
[11:45:14] <robertmaxrees> bbclover wat.  you want .eq()
[11:45:17] <robertmaxrees> not .get()
[11:45:29] <bbclover> well .eq() doesn't tell me what the object is
[11:45:40] <robertmaxrees> .eq(0) i mean
[11:45:47] <bbclover> yeah, me too
[11:46:14] <bbclover> it returns [object Object]{0: HTMLDivElement {...}, context: HTMLDocument {...}, editabletypes: Object {...}, editableutils... doesn't tell me what class, etc
[11:46:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused then.
[11:46:23] <robertmaxrees> right...
[11:46:28] <robertmaxrees> you can then run jquery methods against it.
[11:46:42] <bbclover> ok
[11:46:54] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that you were trying to run jquery methods against a non-jquery object
[11:47:00] <robertmaxrees> that's why scrollLeft() doesn't work.
[11:47:15] <robertmaxrees> replacing .get(0) with .eq(0) in your example will get you there.
[11:47:24] <robertmaxrees> though you should really avoid your universal selector if possible.
[11:48:43] <notchris> @robertmaxrees Any idea why this isn’t working? http://pastebin.com/svx97y4t
[11:48:51] <notchris> Should be working on this page: 	http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/getting-here/
[11:49:27] <bbclover> robertmaxrees I have this: http://pastebin.com/n1up5v3j and it's only scrolling once, the initial click. If I scroll back to the left and click the contScroll again it'll scroll once again
[11:49:28] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Can you set up a demo. I set up a little thing here to mess with: http://jsbin.com/quqirixepu/1/edit?css,js,output
[11:49:42] <bbclover> so I did that to try to capture the object who's scrollLeft was 245 just for testing
[11:49:53] <bbclover> but you know that only works for the second scroll cause I'd have to do another filter for 490, etc
[11:50:42] <robertmaxrees> notchris can you setup a simplified test case?
[11:51:01] <robertmaxrees> if not, how do I replicate the issue you're having?
[11:51:04] <devslash> why is it so difficult to get an event to work in jquery ?
[11:51:06] <notchris> @robertmaxrees I followed tihs: http://jsbin.com/tuyoleyaka/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:51:16] <notchris> I set each of my panels to have the class dirpanel
[11:51:26] <notchris> I set each of the buttons to have dirbutton
[11:51:32] <robertmaxrees> devslash it's not :)
[11:51:37] <BillCriswell> devslash: It's not, and at this point you're just trying to get a reaction out of someone.
[11:51:43] <devslash> well then why isnt any event working for me
[11:52:03] <BillCriswell> devslash: You're doing something incorrectly.
[11:52:22] <devslash> well i copied the event from the jquery page
[11:52:35] <robertmaxrees> devslash you dodn't copy an event.  you copied the binding.
[11:52:49] <robertmaxrees> notchris okay - where is that on your page?
[11:52:54] <devslash> no i copied the code the the event from the jquery page
[11:53:05] <notchris> Each direction panel is “dirpanel”
[11:53:20] <notchris> Each button on the right is “dirbutton”
[11:53:40] <robertmaxrees> devslash i'm being a pedant and pointing out that you're binding to an event.
[11:53:42] <robertmaxrees> not triggering one.
[11:53:51] <BillCriswell> notchris: http://jsbin.com/tuyoleyaka/1/edit?html,js,output this didn't work?
[11:54:00] <devslash> ok however you want to word it, it does not work
[11:54:07] <notchris> @BillCriswell It does in the example, but not on my page
[11:54:51] <robertmaxrees> notchris where are you including that code on your page?
[11:56:13] <bbclover> BillCriswell: I edited it but how do I sharei t
[11:56:23] <bbclover> http://jsbin.com/kiyujonuta/1/
[11:56:49] <bbclover> http://jsbin.com/kiyujonuta/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[11:56:57] <notchris> Phew. it works now
[11:57:04] <notchris> It was having an issue with the placement
[11:57:10] <notchris> Such a js nub lawl
[11:57:11] <bbclover> I just want the damn thing to scroll when I click that anchor
[11:57:13] <bbclover> like it does here
[11:57:18] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Are you just trying to at 30 each click?
[11:57:27] <BillCriswell> to add*
[11:57:33] <bbclover> well it's 245 in my example, but yeah
[11:57:39] <bbclover> well in my code
[11:57:49] <bbclover> cause there's other things there
[11:58:01] <robertmaxrees> but you want do to it to each one?
[11:58:32] <bbclover> I mean there's other things to scorll to
[11:58:43] <bbclover> so it's like if I had a lot of text in there
[11:59:00] <bbclover> and every 245 pixels is a new column
[11:59:51] <notchris> Thank you @BillCriswell  @robertmaxrees
[11:59:51] <BillCriswell> I'm baffled.
[11:59:55] <BillCriswell> notchris: No problem.
[12:00:09] <mariuscc> I want the html from a selected <option>html I want</option>
[12:00:22] <bbclover> I'm explaining it horribly. I just want to make it scroll 245 every time I click that <a>
[12:00:37] <bbclover> there's only one $('.foo')
[12:00:40] <robertmaxrees> make what scroll?  every box?
[12:00:49] <bbclover> I only have one box
[12:00:55] <bbclover> and it works the first time
[12:00:57] <bbclover> but not after that
[12:01:08] <bbclover> it scrolls 245 the first time, but then no more
[12:01:21] <bbclover> and if I scrollback to the beginning I can hit it again and it'll scroll to 245
[12:01:46] <robertmaxrees> the "what" is where i'm confused.
[12:01:49] <BillCriswell> bbclover: http://jsbin.com/nipupukace/1/edit?html,js,output ?
[12:02:34] <BillCriswell> bbclover: You want it to scroll to the next multiple of 245px?
[12:02:50] <bbclover> no
[12:02:58] <bbclover> I want to make it scroll 245 from where I am at
[12:03:09] <BillCriswell> Ok, so the code I gave you is what you want?
[12:04:02] <devslash> can anyone help me figure out why this event is not triggering ? http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/7/
[12:04:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:04:23] <bbclover> BillCriswell: it only works once
[12:04:25] <bbclover> that was my pastebin
[12:04:36] <bbclover> I hit scroll once and it'll scroll
[12:04:41] <BillCriswell> bbclover: No it doesn't.
[12:04:42] <bbclover> but if I hit it again it won't go anymore
[12:04:56] <bbclover> no I know this example works... I'm saying it doesn't work in my code
[12:05:14] <cjohnson> so adapt the example to your code
[12:05:15] <robertmaxrees> devslash the blur event doesn't bubble.
[12:05:50] <devslash> what do you mean bubble ?
[12:06:05] <BillCriswell> bbclover: Well, we can't exact debug that.
[12:06:14] <bbclover> cjohnson: my code is the same. Maybe my .cPanel isn't what's being scrolled as BillCriswell mentioned before
[12:06:19] <robertmaxrees> the nav element itself doens't emit the event, one of its children would.  the handler on nav won't catch the event that bubbles up.
[12:06:22] <bbclover> but something is scrolling, and I tried to filter to find that element
[12:06:40] <devslash> so how do i make it work
[12:06:48] <bbclover> and it seems like .cPanel is what was scrolled... but scrollLeft() is always 0
[12:07:01] <cjohnson> link to your page bbclover?
[12:07:02] <robertmaxrees> devslash what about my explanation before didn't make sense?
[12:07:08] <devslash> everything
[12:07:43] <cjohnson> lol
[12:07:45] <bbclover> locally deployed =\
[12:07:58] <robertmaxrees> welp
[12:08:00] <cjohnson> bbclover: well you'll have to figure out where your code differs from his example
[12:08:01] <bbclover> eh it's whatever
[12:08:05] <bbclover> yeah
[12:08:12] <bbclover> it's something else going on clearly
[12:08:33] <devslash> ive tried everything. i cannot figure out why it wont trigger
[12:08:49] <cjohnson> he just explained why it won't trigger devslash
[12:08:57] <devslash> i dont understand
[12:09:06] <robertmaxrees> what don't you understand?
[12:09:09] <cjohnson> "the nav element itself doesn't emit the event"
[12:09:10] <robertmaxrees> don't say "everything"
[12:09:14] <robertmaxrees> start with the basics.
[12:09:18] <devslash> what does that mean
[12:09:27] <robertmaxrees> what does WHAT mean?
[12:09:32] <devslash> can you just how me how to make it work
[12:09:48] <cjohnson> this isn't a "write my code for me" channel devslash
[12:10:03] <bbclover> how do I filter for objects that have scrollLeft greater than 150, for example?
[12:10:08] <devslash> im not asking you to write code just correct the event
[12:10:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:10:31] <robertmaxrees> you're not writing events dude.
[12:10:35] <robertmaxrees> you're writing listeners.
[12:10:44] <devslash> who fucking cares if its called an event or not ?!?!
[12:11:00] <cjohnson> the people who you want to write your code for you
[12:11:09] <cjohnson> for free
[12:11:26] <bbclover> ha
[12:16:01] <bbclover> I'm trying to do something like $('*').filter(function () { return $(this).scrollLeft() === 245; }).eq(0).scrollLeft($('*').filter(function () { return $(this).scrollLeft() > 245; }).get(0);
[12:16:05] <bbclover> errr! that's wrong
[12:16:30] * BillCriswell throws in the towel
[12:16:31] <bbclover> $('*').filter(function () { return $(this).scrollLeft() > 245; }).eq(0); can I do that?
[12:16:55] <bbclover> that was incorrectly copied!
[12:16:56] <robertmaxrees> get the first element whose scrollLeft is greater than 245?
[12:19:13] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that code will go through every element, find all of them who have a scrollLeft greater than 245, and then return the first one.
[12:19:35] <bbclover> yeah, just using it for debugging purposes
[12:20:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:34:20] <paul_uk> hey all, anyone know of a plugin that is a button but when clicked displays a hierarchical dropdown with a parent > child 1 level structure?  where both the parent and child can be selected.  if i cant find something i'll make it.
[12:38:46] <eskatrem> if I make a draggable element with jquery, can I make it draggable only by a certain part?
[12:39:32] <eskatrem> something like: a suitcase you can only grab (drag) by the handle
[12:42:24] <cjohnson> you could use the ignore option
[12:42:45] <NoiseEee> speaking as a user that sounds shitty
[12:42:50] <NoiseEee> let me drag the friggin' suitcase
[12:43:12] <cjohnson> yeah probably. hard to say though
[12:43:48] <paul_uk> whats in the suitcase?
[12:44:08] <blackkbot> cocaine
[12:44:20] <paul_uk> with passport, money and a gun
[12:44:33] <eskatrem> haha, it's not a suitcase I have in mind
[12:44:57] <eskatrem> I thought the suitcase thing would be a good example, but what I have in mind is some maths expressions
[13:14:31] <bbclover> can you put if statements inside animate like a.animate({ if() });?
[13:14:44] <decx> use the handle option in draggable eskatrem
[13:14:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't put an if within an object like that.
[13:15:00] <decx> lol channel dead for 30min and then 2answers
[13:15:01] <decx> ^^
[13:15:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:15:21] <bbclover> how would I do this then efficiently
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?  i was gone for a bit.
[13:15:31] <bbclover> I want to do something if something and something else if not
[13:15:44] <eskatrem> decx: I'll check the handle option, didnt know about it
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to ser a property value?
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> *set
[13:15:50] <bbclover> yeah
[13:15:51] <bbclover> oh just trying to do some arbitrary animation, but they're both gonna be scrollLeft
[13:15:54] <robertmaxrees> use an iife.
[13:16:02] <bbclover> holy smokes
[13:16:10] <bbclover> aren't those very advanced
[13:16:36] <robertmaxrees> myProp: (function() { if (conditionOne) { return 7;} else { return 10000; } }})();
[13:16:38] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[13:16:41] <eskatrem> oh yeah, there is the handle option! thanks
[13:16:45] <robertmaxrees> or use a ternary.
[13:17:05] <bbclover> ohhhh yeah
[13:17:07] <robertmaxrees> the ternary is going to probably be more appropriate in this case.
[13:18:43] <robertmaxrees> myProp: (thingOne === thingTwo) ? trueExpression : falseExpression;
[13:20:27] <bbclover> do I wrap expressions in paranthesis?
[13:20:41] <robertmaxrees> only if you want to.
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> same with the conditional.
[13:20:47] <robertmaxrees> the parens are optional there.
[13:21:13] <bbclover> ok
[13:23:04] <devslash> robertmaxrees, i haven't figured this out. can you please help me out
[13:23:26] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got.
[13:23:50] <blackkbot> lol thats so dirty
[13:23:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:23:58] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/10/
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:24:18] <devslash> oops
[13:24:18] <robertmaxrees> where's the javascript you';ve tried?
[13:24:19] <devslash> sorry
[13:24:38] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/8/
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> i told you what you need to do earlier.
[13:25:10] <devslash> ok i dont understand what you mean
[13:25:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you going back to focusout?  it's not going ot fix your problem.
[13:25:30] <robertmaxrees> because you're not focused on .slide-in-nav or any of its children.
[13:25:57] <BillCriswell> This is still going on.
[13:26:13] <xMopxShell> Hey, if i’m storing a function in .data(), like $(“.myelememt”).data(“changeSometjing”, function(){…}), how can I retrieve the specific $(“.myelememt”) that the function is ‘attached’ to from inside the function?
[13:26:25] <devslash> how do i fix it
[13:26:57] <robertmaxrees> devslash start with my suggestion earlier.
[13:27:02] <devslash> which one
[13:27:03] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell don't store functions in data like that.
[13:27:18] <robertmaxrees> devslash bind a click event handler to the document.
[13:27:30] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: why not?
[13:27:31] <devslash> why click event ?
[13:27:41] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell because that's storing functions in data.
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> devslash you want to close the nav when you click outside of it, correct?
[13:28:03] <devslash> no
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:28:11] <devslash> when the mouse hovers outside of it
[13:28:12] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: so you would say its bad practice or?
[13:28:15] <cjohnson> xMopxShell: what are you trying to store
[13:28:17] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell basically yes.
[13:28:20] <cjohnson> store/do
[13:28:26] <robertmaxrees> devslash >.> then use mouseout.
[13:28:34] <devslash> on which element
[13:28:38] <robertmaxrees> the nav
[13:28:40] <xMopxShell> a function that’s meant to target stuff inside the element it’s attached to
[13:28:57] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell don't store that in data.
[13:29:00] <xMopxShell> that i want to 'save for later', i suppose
[13:29:08] <cjohnson> map the function to an event handler, store only the data in the data elements
[13:29:08] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: why?
[13:29:12] <devslash> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/11/
[13:29:19] <cjohnson> it's bad practices he just said
[13:29:21] <xMopxShell> is it bad practice? will it break in some browsers?
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell it's bad practice.
[13:29:33] <robertmaxrees> and it munges your separations of concern.
[13:29:36] <xMopxShell> I see
[13:29:46] <robertmaxrees> devslash basically.
[13:29:48] <xMopxShell> Is there a way to do what i’m asking?
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell have an example of what you're trying to do?
[13:29:59] <cjohnson> it just makes no sense. instead of storing a function that holds some data on the element, just store the data right on the element, and attach the function to the element via events or something else
[13:30:01] <BillCriswell> xMopxShell: How are you getting to the element?
[13:30:19] <xMopxShell> Let’s say i do this: $(“.myelememt”).data(“changeSometjing”, function(){…}),
[13:30:32] <xMopxShell> Inside of function(){…}, is it possible to retrieve the specific $(“.myelememt”) ?
[13:30:34] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell when are you going to run that code?
[13:30:39] <robertmaxrees> don't store functiuons in .data()
[13:30:44] <cjohnson> no what are you trying to do
[13:30:47] <cjohnson> not how are you trying to do it
[13:31:12] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: i’m aware, all I’m asking is if that is possible, not advice on structuring my code.
[13:31:24] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:31:30] <cjohnson> no, it's not.
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> people have been pretty rude today.
[13:31:36] <xMopxShell> ok, thanks
[13:31:42] <cjohnson> and for that reason, you need to restructure your code
[13:31:50] <xMopxShell> robertmaxrees: i wouldn’t start complaining about rudeness if i was you
[13:31:56] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[13:32:00] <cjohnson> lol
[13:32:01] <blackkbot> really?
[13:32:03] <robertmaxrees> jesus
[13:32:06] <cjohnson> don't bite robertmaxrees!
[13:32:09] <cjohnson> hah
[13:32:20] <devslash> robertmaxrees, that event isnt firing correctly though
[13:32:52] <xMopxShell> Look at it from another perspective. Someone asks a simple question about how jQuery works
[13:33:04] <robertmaxrees> devslash yes, it is.  the event is firing.
[13:33:09] <xMopxShell> and is bombarded with "change the rest of the code that we can’t see"
[13:33:10] <robertmaxrees> the handler isn't doing what you expect.
[13:33:31] <devslash> I want it to fire when the mouse is not over that black drawer
[13:33:33] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell because that kind of question is often indicative of another issue.
[13:33:40] <cjohnson> xMopxShell: here's another perspective. you're a hobby house builder hanging out in a room full of professional house builders. you ask "how can I ground my electricity so I can run it through teh water pipes?" and a builder says "that's dumb, don't do that". offering up his advice, without charging you
[13:33:44] <BillCriswell> xMopxShell: I think you're going for something like this, but it sure smells: http://jsbin.com/jagirinire/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:33:58] <cjohnson> and even offers to tell you how better to route your electric lines
[13:33:59] <xMopxShell> cjohnson: now we’re dropping do plain insults?
[13:34:10] <cjohnson> I'm giving an example
[13:34:24] <robertmaxrees> devslash http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/12/ the binding works.
[13:34:57] <robertmaxrees> your other code is the problem.
[13:35:20] <BillCriswell> You're a glutton for punishment.
[13:36:17] <xMopxShell> How can you assume other code exist? It could have been a question just about how jQuery *works*.
[13:36:20] <bbclover> how do I select a class that has a certain child?
[13:36:21] <xMopxShell> Lets just be nice, alright?
[13:36:31] <cjohnson> because any code that depends on a function being in .data() is wrong
[13:36:42] <bbclover> like a child with another class
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell i guess I'm confused about why you'd store functions in nodes like that in the first place.
[13:36:58] <devslash> robertmaxrees,my css ?
[13:37:12] <robertmaxrees> devslash the event binding is running.
[13:37:17] <eskatrem> Hey, jquery and jquery-ui are two different things?
[13:37:21] <robertmaxrees> eskatrem yep.
[13:37:30] <devslash> yes but its not consistently working in firefox
[13:37:36] <BillCriswell> xMopxShell: Was what I posted what you were shooting for?
[13:37:49] <BillCriswell> xMopxShell: I'm just trying to understand out of curiosity.
[13:37:59] <xMopxShell> BillCriswell: no sorry, it doesn’t work
[13:38:02] <eskatrem> devslash: and jquery-ui has jquery in its dependencies?
[13:38:14] <BillCriswell> Yes it does.
[13:38:31] <devslash> what does jquery-ui have to do it ? im not using it
[13:38:35] <xMopxShell> Oh you’re right, i thought i saw alert so i didn’t have my console open
[13:38:41] <robertmaxrees> eskatrem he wasn't talking to you.
[13:39:01] <eskatrem> devslash: sorry, I got the wrong guy
[13:39:04] <devslash> ok
[13:39:05] <xMopxShell> BillCriswell: that only works because this is getting set to the same element by the click event listener
[13:39:25] <eskatrem> robertmaxrees: that question was of you actually, jquery-ui has jquery in its dependencies?
[13:39:31] <cjohnson> provide details about yow you intend to call this function
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> eskatrem yes.  you must use both
[13:40:33] <BillCriswell> xMopxShell: If the function is attached to the element, shouldn't you only need to call it when you have access to the element itself?
[13:40:43] <devslash> is there any reason that that same jsfiddle doesnt work in firefox but does in chrome
[13:41:05] <xMopxShell> BillCriswell: true, but i was hoping for a cleaner way
[13:41:24] <robertmaxrees> devslash yeah, you're doing something kind of unusual.
[13:41:40] <BillCriswell> xMopxShell: I don't understand how you'd call this function without access to the element to begin with, so I'm just confused.
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> might want to change where you're binding the mouseout handler to.
[13:41:57] <devslash> no the exact same fiddle works as expected in chrome but not firefox
[13:42:12] <robertmaxrees> devslash right - which means you likely have a bug.
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> think about why your code might be wrong.
[13:42:36] <robertmaxrees> xMopxShell if you're looking for a "cleaner way", why did you get angry with me when I suggested that you reconsider the route you're going?
[13:43:10] <devslash> i thought jquery is fully compatible with firefox
[13:43:38] <xMopxShell> BillCriswell: you’re totally right, I was just looking to see if it was possible without passing it in myself
[13:43:54] <cjohnson> xMopxShell: it's not. that's the point of event listeners
[13:44:20] <cjohnson> if you want to define a function on an element to be called later and have access to that element without passing it explicitly, use .on / .trigger
[13:44:59] <cjohnson> $('.something').on('someCustomEvent', function() { // this = element });  $('.something').trigger('someCustomEvent')
[13:45:25] <robertmaxrees> devslash it is.
[13:45:31] <robertmaxrees> the problem is not firefox or jquery.
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> the problem is with your code
[13:45:40] <devslash> why ?
[13:45:44] <robertmaxrees> think about it.
[13:45:46] <devslash> the fiddle works in chrome but not FF
[13:45:51] <devslash> how is that a code issue?
[13:45:58] <devslash> and not a  browser issue
[13:46:00] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[13:46:24] <cjohnson> devslash: if you make a part for a ford fiesta and it doesn't fit a honda accord, do you say that honda did something wrong?
[13:47:00] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: You're really on with these analogies today.
[13:47:14] <cjohnson> it's the whiskey
[13:47:27] <devslash> we're talking about jquery which is supposed to be compatible with both browsers. if the event works in chrome but not firefox, is it a code issue or a browser issue?
[13:47:28] <eskatrem> sorry, not a jquery question, but if I have something like <div>text_1</div><div>text_2</div>, is there a way to have text_1 and text_2 horizontally aligned?
[13:47:57] <BillCriswell> eskatrem: #css question.
[13:48:06] <eskatrem> BillCriswell: alright then
[13:48:20] <BillCriswell> eskatrem: Google would probably be a lot quicker though.
[13:48:37] <robertmaxrees> devslash the event is fine.
[13:48:39] <robertmaxrees> 100%
[13:48:48] <devslash> ok then why doesnt it work in firefox ?
[13:48:49] <robertmaxrees> the handler code, that YOU wrote, is what's broken.
[13:49:07] <devslash> im basing that on the console.log
[13:49:16] <devslash> if it displays, then as far as im concerned it works
[13:49:19] <devslash> ok?
[13:49:33] <devslash> it displays in Chrome when its supposed to but not firefox
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> look at how often it fires.
[13:50:03] <devslash> in chrome it fires whenever the mouse is not on the nav
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> this is partially a side-effect of the fact that you're using a hidden checkbox to hide/show an element.
[13:50:38] <robertmaxrees> and that the label isn't inside of the element that you care about.
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> and other quirks about those kinds of events.
[13:51:35] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:55:13] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/ma8kf1vg/ .register class submit button is never being targeted
[13:55:50] <cjohnson> the submit event emits from the form node, not the <section> node
[13:55:56] <cjohnson> try .register form
[13:56:09] <cjohnson> oh ignore me I missed your second argument
[13:57:24] <cjohnson> it seems to be targeted for me in your fiddle once I fix the missing jquery refernece
[13:57:35] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/ma8kf1vg/1/
[13:57:35] <cjohnson> I get fires
[13:57:41] <AcidRain> hmmm
[13:57:46] <kingplusplus> please do i need to learn Javascript before jumping into jquery?
[13:58:30] <devslash> yes you should
[13:58:33] <NoiseEee> kingplusplus: you should have a basic understanding of it at least, yes
[13:58:36] <devslash> most definitely
[13:58:56] <AcidRain> cjohnson, http://acidshower.com:81/inventory/ could u look here? click on the register link to the left side
[13:59:00] <AcidRain> and just click submit
[13:59:11] <AcidRain> never fires
[13:59:16] <cjohnson> takes me to this page http://acidshower.com:81/inventory/Register
[13:59:26] <AcidRain> ye i know. that is wrong
[13:59:33] <AcidRain> not supposed to take u to any page
[13:59:41] <kingplusplus> how long does it take or if it seems too vague I know am an average learner like others I like to know how long it took you to learn... please share with me
[14:00:22] <AcidRain> kingplusplus, for me, jquery isnt something i ever learned. i just read docs when i want to get something done. i come here when i fail at it
[14:00:33] <AcidRain> people like cjohnson help u <3
[14:00:33] <blackkbot> i learned javascript at the same time i learned java and visual basic 6 epocs ago but i didn't 'know' it
[14:00:44] <cjohnson> I just put this in my console AcidRain $('.register').on('submit', 'form', function() { alert('foo'); });
[14:00:49] <cjohnson> and the alert fired when I clicked the submit button
[14:00:55] <cjohnson> so there's something else at play
[14:01:02] <AcidRain> hmmm
[14:01:26] <devslash> robertmaxrees, are you back ?
[14:02:31] <AcidRain> cjohnson, i added alert() on my server. still no firing. inspect element and look at the divs
[14:03:22] <AcidRain> it goes: <section class='content'> <section class='register'> <form action='Register' method='post'>  <--- here
[14:03:41] <cjohnson> oh I see, you're binding to an element that doesn't exist yet at time of binding
[14:03:45] <cjohnson> there is no .register on page load
[14:03:57] <AcidRain> ye. is my function not delegated?
[14:04:16] <cjohnson> it is. if your .register existed on page load and a form were added after the fact, it would work
[14:04:25] <cjohnson> but because .register itself isn't added til later, the event is never bound
[14:04:27] <cjohnson> try this instead
[14:04:37] <AcidRain> ah
[14:04:44] <cjohnson> $(document).on('submit', '.register form', fun...
[14:04:46] <AcidRain> i need to reload content
[14:04:55] <cjohnson> the point is to bind to an element that always exists
[14:05:08] <AcidRain> ye, content class will always exist
[14:05:08] <cjohnson> ideally you'd use a specific node inside your page instead of document but this will get you started
[14:05:08] <AcidRain> thx man
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> back - devslash i have some other stuff to jump on.  good luck.
[14:06:26] * blackkbot jumps on other stuff
[14:07:03] <AcidRain> sry, content is being reloaded as well. #containerCenter is what i meant to say. and it works now
[14:07:06] <AcidRain> cjohnson, thank u
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> today is busy busy busy
[14:07:51] <devslash> ok thanks
[14:08:39] <devslash> 1 last thing though. I realize css code changes based on browser but jquery should and has always worked the same on compatible browsers withoujt issue
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> devslash the code that is broken isn't apart of jquery
[14:09:29] <devslash> ok then which part is ? the html or the css ?
[14:09:39] <cjohnson> the JS that you wrote
[14:09:45] <robertmaxrees> the handler.
[14:10:23] <devslash> but the handler is the jquery code
[14:10:26] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:10:41] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating your code with what jquery provides.
[14:10:41] <devslash> then what is ?
[14:10:42] <TrentonDAdams> I'm migrating from jQuery 8.  The migrate plugin doesn't say I've done anything wrong, but the "Processing..." div I created is no longer hiding after all ajax requests are complete.  Has something changed that I should look at?
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> "jquery 8?
[14:10:51] <robertmaxrees> 1.8?
[14:10:52] <TrentonDAdams> I'm going to the latest jquery by the way
[14:10:53] <blackkbot> ? is a question mark
[14:10:57] <TrentonDAdams> Yes 8
[14:10:58] <TrentonDAdams> 1.8
[14:11:27] <robertmaxrees> devslash we're tyring to get you to experiment and see what works/what doesn't.
[14:11:32] <TrentonDAdams> Yes, I work in a place that likes to move slowly, I'm profusely sorry! :P
[14:11:33] <robertmaxrees> we're not going to fix it for ypou.
[14:11:40] <cjohnson> unless you pay me
[14:11:49] <devslash> ihow can i fix something when i dont understand what is wrong
[14:11:57] <robertmaxrees> TrentonDAdams it's all good :) i did a recent transition.  could you share the broken code?
[14:11:59] <devslash> i would if someone could get it to work at this point
[14:12:02] <TrentonDAdams> I know you're not going to fix it for me.  I'm just wondering if something in the area of ajax start/stop has changed?
[14:12:06] <cjohnson> that process is called "debugging" devslash
[14:13:10] <blackkbot> its the first thing you learn to do as a programmer
[14:13:22] <devslash> i know how to debug
[14:13:34] <cjohnson> sweet! good luck
[14:13:37] <cjohnson> let us know if you have specific questions
[14:13:42] <devslash> bbut theres no error
[14:13:55] <blackkbot> yeah thats still debugging
[14:14:00] <robertmaxrees> you have a bug.
[14:14:05] <robertmaxrees> you need to remove the bug.
[14:14:06] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees: That's difficult, cause I don't know what's broken yet.  I was hoping for a quick "yeah, ajax start/stop doesn't work the same anymore, look here for info.  Just a sec, I'll see if I can see it quickly.
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> TrentonDAdams http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#ajax-events-should-be-attached-to-document
[14:14:36] <robertmaxrees> something tells me this should help you.
[14:15:55] <guideX> how do I select a tr I dynamically added, with this:       var tr = $('[data-termsid="' + termsId + '"][data-joinid="' + joinId + '"]"');
[14:16:09] <guideX> jquery doesn't seem able to find the dynamic item
[14:16:19] <robertmaxrees> guideX how are you adding the data to the element?
[14:16:35] <guideX> $("#obj").before(' ....
[14:16:41] <guideX> then it's just markup
[14:16:41] <robertmaxrees> are you using .data()?
[14:16:57] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees: Yeah, been doing that for awhile.  I accidentally included a jquery 1.9 js with a 1.11, maybe that's it, just a sec...
[14:16:58] <robertmaxrees> it might be getting converted.  avoid selecting on data elements.
[14:17:14] <guideX> oh hmm
[14:17:20] <AcidRain> devslash, ill fix for 1$ cheaper than anyone here
[14:17:44] <robertmaxrees> guideX you could also .filter() for the element you want.
[14:17:56] <guideX> .filter eh, I'm not familiar with that one..
[14:18:01] <guideX> i'll research it
[14:18:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> it's a good'un
[14:18:08] <guideX> might be too new for my jquery version though
[14:18:16] <robertmaxrees> what version are you on?
[14:18:25] <guideX> I don't know, it's always old, let me check
[14:18:27] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees: Okay, I must have done that document start/stop in another app, cause it's not in this one.
[14:18:40] <guideX> jquery 1.5.1
[14:18:51] <robertmaxrees> guideX filter works fine in 1.5.1
[14:18:55] <guideX> ah ok cool
[14:19:03] <guideX> i'll check .filter then, thx
[14:19:03] <robertmaxrees> the original version was in 1.0, and it got some enhancements in 1.4
[14:19:09] <guideX> ah ok
[14:19:12] <robertmaxrees> the features you want were in 1.0 though.
[14:19:37] <guy> is there a selector that would select .foo that has a descendant .bar? eqv. of $('.foo .bar').each(function () { var foo = $(this).parents('.foo'); })
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> guy you want :has() iirc
[14:20:01] <guy> that was obvious.. first result on google
[14:20:07] <guy> sorry : )
[14:20:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:21:10] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees: Thanks, that was it
[14:21:14] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:21:18] <robertmaxrees> glad to hear :)
[14:21:19] <guideX> hmm filter is not defined
[14:21:23] <guideX> maybe it's a specialty thing
[14:21:27] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:21:30] <robertmaxrees> it's apart of core jquery.
[14:21:38] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees: It was this one I worked on, I was using the new "document" association of ajax events on some stuff, but never converted the old stuff
[14:21:43] <guideX> ah ok.. hmm isn't seem to be recognized
[14:21:48] <guideX> *doesn't seem to be
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> guideX how are you trying to use it?
[14:21:56] <TrentonDAdams> robertmaxrees: You probably saved me an hour right there, thanks! :D
[14:22:01] <robertmaxrees> TrentonDAdams :D
[14:22:05] <guideX> $("blah").filter("Blah");
[14:22:22] <robertmaxrees> guideX do console.log($.fn.filter);
[14:22:24] <TrentonDAdams> I should totally hang here more often, I might be able to help other people. :D
[14:22:25] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:22:37] <NoiseEee> guideX: are you sure you're using .filter on an actual jquery object and not a plain ol DOM element/
[14:22:46] <TrentonDAdams> Anyhow, out for the day, ttyl.
[14:23:19] <guideX> NoiseEee: hmm I'm starting with no object, then I am looking for an object in the dom which was dynamically created
[14:23:33] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:23:37] <guideX> so like $("mytable tr").find(".myclass") etc
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> $('blah') needs to be something.
[14:23:40] <guideX> err .filter
[14:24:18] <guideX> when I do that console.log($.fn.filter) I get undefined
[14:24:27] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:24:37] <robertmaxrees> what about $.fn.jquery
[14:24:38] <guideX> maybe this is why I don't use it lol
[14:24:40] <guideX> let me check
[14:24:54] <guideX> 1.5.1
[14:24:57] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:25:21] <devslash> robertmaxrees,ive figured out how to make it work properly thanks
[14:25:22] <NoiseEee> weeeird
[14:25:32] <robertmaxrees> devslash share your solution.
[14:27:54] <guideX> oooo .find works
[14:28:02] <devslash> http://jsfiddle.net/6xyr00v9/13/
[14:28:07] <robertmaxrees> guideX i'd figure out why you don't have .filter9) btw.
[14:28:11] <guideX> found it this way:     var tr = $("#tblProductSpecifications").find('tr[data-termsid="' + termsId + '"][data-joinid="' + joinId + '"]"');
[14:28:18] <guideX> hmm i'll look into that
[14:28:27] <guideX> honestly I've neverr used that one though...
[14:28:30] <robertmaxrees> and really, avoid using data attribues for selectors.
[14:28:44] <robertmaxrees> devslash i'd reconsider using .click() like that, but whatever floats your boat.
[14:28:51] <guideX> several things never seem to work, like for instance, I can never get data or other .attr alternatives
[14:29:04] <guideX> but whatev, working now :)
[14:29:25] <devslash> whats wrong with tha ?
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> that's actually kind of a big problem, guideX.
[14:29:53] <robertmaxrees> devslash you should focus on adding/removing classes instead of implicitly routing through your UI using events like that.
[14:29:58] <robertmaxrees> but whatever floats your boat.
[14:30:08] <guideX> or gets the update out the door :))
[14:30:17] <pantsofchocolate> hey guys quick question, whats the best way to print all indices of occurances in a string, like 'abc123abc' would print out 0 and 6?
[14:31:11] <cjohnson> I think that's a good use case for .match
[14:31:28] <cjohnson> hrm that won't give you the index on second though
[14:32:04] <guideX> NoiseEee_: do you have an eee slate? just wondering..
[14:32:15] <NoiseEee_> guideX: nope
[14:32:52] <devslash> what class would i need to add to get that same effect ?
[14:33:25] <cjohnson> TRY some things devslash
[14:33:29] <cjohnson> stop being lazy
[14:34:08] <pantsofchocolate> yea listen to megatron! or ocho cinco or whichever cjohnson he is
[14:34:11] <guideX> but jquery exists BECAUSE of lazy developers :) j/k
[14:34:18] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:39:01] <Kartagis> $('a[href*=#]:not([href=#])').click(function() { <--- what does this mean?
[14:39:07] <robertmaxrees> D:
[14:39:20] <Kartagis> I mean href
[14:39:26] <Kartagis> href*
[14:39:27] <blackkbot> it exists for lazy devs not because of lazy devs
[14:39:53] <robertmaxrees> any anchor that has a # as an href but not as the only character.
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis so it'll recognize href="#myButt", but not href="#"
[14:40:40] <Kartagis> okay
[14:40:44] <blackkbot> and href='mybutt#'
[14:41:06] <robertmaxrees> ^ that too
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> or "my#butt
[14:41:33] <blackkbot> *= is anywhere in the attribute i think ~= is at the beginning
[14:41:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.  * is "contains"
[14:43:31] <pantsofchocolate> ugh my brain hurts

[14:51:38] <dan_j> Hi. When building a large web app using jquery, whats the best way to store each of the visual elements? I'm sure having a huge html file with all the DIVs isn't the best way to do things. I'd probably want it to only load the DIVs when required if thats possible.
[14:51:59] <blackkbot> its very hit or miss because its so slapstick
[14:52:01] <robertmaxrees> dan_j how are you defining "large web app"?  what are your requirements?  etc.
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> dan_j are you running into performance issues already?
[14:52:44] <dan_j> I havent started. So far i've only been using jquery with ajax for some simple stuff. One page containing all the elements.
[14:53:05] <robertmaxrees> don't prematurely optimize.
[14:53:16] <dan_j> Large as in about 10 different dialogs to display information and about 3 separate sections.
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> dan_j that's not a whole lot.
[14:53:35] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about it yet.
[14:53:46] <blackkbot> worry if it is slow after you build it
[14:53:52] <robertmaxrees> sorta yea.
[14:54:15] <cjohnson> dan_j: my general rule is if the dialog can appear on every page, I might just include the dialog HTML with the page load and hide it
[14:54:28] <cjohnson> dan_j: if it's only going to be used on some pages, put the dialog in its own file to be loaded via ajax
[14:54:40] <robertmaxrees> or load it via your backend conditionally.
[14:55:05] <dan_j> Out of interest, what about large projects? I'm looking at eventually making something similar to this: https://my.profitbricks.com/dashboard/dcdr2/?testDrive=true&sourceregion=us
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> "large projects" is ephemeral
[14:55:45] <sammych1> google docs is large ;)
[14:55:49] <sammych1> icloud.com is large
[14:55:55] <blackkbot> javascri.pt is the biggest page ive been to in a long long time
[14:55:59] <dan_j> Ok avoiding the wording large projects, something like the example below isn't just one page of html and javascript.
[14:56:00] <sammych1> ps online is large
[14:56:04] <blackkbot> and i don't think it has any javascript in it
[14:56:17] <robertmaxrees> dan_j don't prematurely optimize.
[14:56:42] <cjohnson> if it's one page you're wasting time by worrying about it
[14:56:52] <blackkbot> no wait its all js lol
[14:57:03] <dan_j> So dump everything into one html and on JS file for now?
[14:57:12] <robertmaxrees> it really depends on what you're doing.
[14:57:18] <robertmaxrees> but that should be fine.
[14:57:28] <sammych1> templating?
[14:57:37] <sammych1> how different are your dialogs?
[14:57:57] <robertmaxrees> lots of variables at play :)
[14:58:05] <dan_j> Out of interest, if i wanted to keep dialogs separate, just to help me keep the html organised, how would JS load a html file and add it to the existing dom? Ajax?
[14:58:13] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:58:48] <sammych1> $.load is heavy but useful
[14:58:58] <cjohnson> ideally you keep the HTML files separate and then your backend will conditionally include the right files
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:59:05] <robertmaxrees> this
[14:59:12] <blackkbot> browserify
[14:59:37] <sammych1> as long as you don't keep everything separate, which means you'll end up making too many requests
[14:59:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah there's a balance to it.
[14:59:52] <dan_j> true
[14:59:54] <sammych1> stuff that is used 80%, keep together
[15:00:51] <dan_j> Are there any recommended IDEs to use when developing these types of web applications? Rather than a simple text editor? Or is simple the best?
[15:00:57] <blackkbot> unless premature optimization is already occuring as we give advice
[15:01:14] <blackkbot> i like jsfiddle.net
[15:01:16] <robertmaxrees> dan_j i use sublime text for everything and like it.
[15:01:27] <robertmaxrees> that plus my browser's dev tools are often all I need.
[15:01:32] <robertmaxrees> others like things like webstorm.
[15:02:01] <sammych1> webstorm is great. It's like eclipse, except it's not.
[15:03:49] <sammych1> I didn't know jsfiddle could build webapps ;)
[15:04:45] <blackkbot> you build it then break it apart somewhere else
[15:05:36] <sammych1> I wish jsbin had the tidy feature. good for cleaning up generated html and whatnot
[15:05:57] <blackkbot> yeah the tidy button is the whole reason i like jsfiddle
[15:06:00] <blackkbot> lol
[15:06:26] <blackkbot> other places have it but its not as easy to invoke as that giant button at the top
[15:08:57] <cjohnson> also echo api
[15:09:09] <cjohnson> and incentivizes opening your actual console
[15:12:15] <dan_j> I tried webstorm but didnt really like it. So far, i've been working with dreamviewer, just so i can easily click on an area of the design and go straight to the code.
[15:13:01] <blackkbot> like right click inspect element?
[15:13:55] <robertmaxrees> :D
[15:14:50] <cjohnson> the browser is really the best place to do things anymore
[15:14:59] <cjohnson> then whatever text editor to get it there
[15:15:02] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[15:16:49] <blackkbot> something that will highlight braces parens and brackets that are matching and beautifies with a preview with ctrl+enter is what i like
[15:17:07] <dan_j> i dunno. when you are dealing with a very large css file, its nice to be able to click on an object and have all of its styles listed, without having to go hunting through the css file
[15:17:52] <blackkbot> inspect element
[15:18:06] <blackkbot> the right side has css properties
[15:18:10] <blackkbot> and the location they are defined
[15:18:23] <dan_j> Yeh
[15:18:26] <blackkbot> heh
[15:18:30] <blackkbot> but yeah it is nice
[15:30:10] <dan_j> Ok. Thanks guys. Im off
[16:36:04] <spudzee> so I'm trying to make a mobile version for my site
[16:37:26] <spudzee> the way I have it done, is it changes the CSS for my desktop version to function differently for mobile. The problem with this is, when I say make a div the size of $(window) then it will leave a bunch of whitespace that I don't want there
[16:37:59] <spudzee> is there anyway to refresh how large the document's width is?
[16:38:13] <spudzee> based on how large the window is?
[16:52:32] <TreyBastian> Hey guys was wondering if anyone here could give me some help with a problem. I'm implementing a smooth scroll when you click a link and it seems to go past the anchor and not take into account the menu on the first click from the top anchor but every link click after that it scrolls correctly until you go back to the top anchor
[16:52:37] <TreyBastian> hope that makes sense
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> are you fixing a menu or something into place?
[16:53:10] <robertmaxrees> normally those are the result of calculating things at the wrong time.
[16:53:10] <TreyBastian> aye and it accounts for that
[16:53:23] <robertmaxrees> can you show us an example?
[16:53:25] <TreyBastian> should I calculate the position in a var before the animate action?
[16:53:54] <TreyBastian> I have it just - menuheight var which gets the element height as it changes height based on device size
[16:57:10] <spudzee> could anyone answer my question?
[16:57:19] <TreyBastian> ok tried that real fast and that didn't work, it only occurs on the first click from the home anchor at the top of the page I can be scrolled anywhere else on the page and it works flawlessly :/
[16:58:26] <robertmaxrees> spudzee it depends on how you're calculating those styles, etc.
[16:59:18] <spudzee> I don't understand
[17:00:11] <robertmaxrees> spudzee " is there anyway to refresh how large the document's width is?" is where you lost me.
[17:00:21] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to refresh?
[17:00:23] <robertmaxrees> like, where?
[17:00:28] <robertmaxrees> because the document knows how wide it is.
[17:01:52] <spudzee> the document has a certain width, right? That width is based on the width of the elements within the page and the viewport size. When I resize my css elements to fit in the page, the document still has the same width; the width required to fit my desktop sized elements
[17:02:22] <spudzee> I'll give an example
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:02:34] <spudzee> hold on
[17:02:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:03:23] <spudzee> so I have a div that is 900 px in width. On mobile, there will be horizontal overflow, correct?
[17:04:09] <robertmaxrees> this isn't answering my question about what you meant with your "refresh" thing.
[17:04:34] <spudzee> hold on, I just want to make sure we're on the same page
[17:04:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:04:55] <robertmaxrees> you can try to describe it to me and i'm more than likely not going to understand the description of it.
[17:05:08] <robertmaxrees> which is why i asked for a code sample.
[17:05:17] <robertmaxrees> a test case shows me what your'e dealing with.
[17:05:33] <spudzee> alright fair enough
[17:05:38] <spudzee> let me go make a jsfiddle
[17:05:55] <robertmaxrees> because you shouldn't need to refresh anything.
[17:09:24] <spudzee> okay this is weird
[17:09:52] <spudzee> somehow my problem is solved in jsfiddle
[17:10:08] <robertmaxrees> spudzee :)
[17:10:18] <spudzee> that doesn't mean it's solved for my site
[17:10:23] <robertmaxrees> noe.
[17:10:25] <robertmaxrees> *nope
[17:10:30] <robertmaxrees> but that gives you a place to start.
[17:10:31] <spudzee> now I have a potentially greater problem
[17:10:36] <BillCriswell> It means you know it's not the problem you thought you had, which is nice.
[17:10:56] <spudzee> the problem I thought I had might have had an easier fix
[17:11:05] <spudzee> urgghhh
[17:11:27] <spudzee> http://jsfiddle.net/cubuL6qw/
[17:11:56] <robertmaxrees> wait are you using javascript to apply styles based on viewport width?
[17:12:01] <TreyBastian> spudzee: I have the exact same issue... I copied my entire html js and css into jsfiddle and it doesnt overscroll in that, but in chrome and safari it seems to -_-
[17:12:14] <spudzee> EXACTLY
[17:12:22] <spudzee> finally someone has the same issue
[17:12:43] <robertmaxrees> spudzee are you sure you don't want media queries instead?
[17:12:47] <TreyBastian> same issue with jsfiddle not the same issue as you are having I don't think :p
[17:12:50] <TreyBastian> not sure what your problem is
[17:13:09] <spudzee> on my chrome inspect element, it keeps the document 900 px
[17:13:23] <spudzee> in width that is
[17:13:26] <BillCriswell> TreyBastian: I have to put way too much extra crap in my JS to account for that bouncing into the negatives and over the actual document height.
[17:13:53] <spudzee> robert, is there a better way than changing the css based on browser through js?
[17:14:03] <TreyBastian> BrillCriswell: my problem is only on first click of a link it seems which is weird and only from the home anchor
[17:14:04] <robertmaxrees> spudzee yes. media queries.
[17:14:07] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what they're for.
[17:14:18] <spudzee> enlighten me
[17:14:21] <TreyBastian> spudzee media queries are your best friend
[17:14:44] <robertmaxrees> spudzee media quries allow you to specify styles that should be applied based on the browser's width.
[17:14:51] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries
[17:14:52] <TreyBastian> @media(min-width: 300px) { #BLOCK { width: 300px; }} or whatever you want
[17:15:00] <TreyBastian> that is just an example spudzee not one to go with :p
[17:18:14] <robertmaxrees> tons of reading material out there, spudzee :)
[17:19:20] <spudzee> I know there are docs and things, and I like docs. I just never know where to find them
[17:19:26] <robertmaxrees> MDN
[17:19:28] <robertmaxrees> always
[17:19:45] <spudzee> I would have never thought "there must be a thing called media queries to solve my issue"
[17:19:53] <TreyBastian> easy enough to just google how to do something and stackoverflow answer first one on google will be it 99% of the time
[17:20:05] <spudzee> yeah, I usually do that
[17:20:24] <TreyBastian> unless it's a stupid thing that only occurs once and never again but the first time urgghhh!!! :p
[17:21:11] <spudzee> my Dad is a web dev, so SOMETIMES, I can get help from him

[17:43:09] <sammych1> quick: a number formatting library
[17:43:31] <sammych1> well, *the* recommended one. accounting.js? numeral.js?
[17:43:37] <snover> dojo
[17:44:23] <sammych1> okay, has to be standalone to be added into a server env
[17:44:45] <sammych1> so, might be easier to ask for a node version
[17:44:54] <sammych1> (but I'm not looking for a node version)
[17:46:16] <snover> if it’s for node.js then build it with the built-in Intl support
[17:46:20] <snover> and use Intl
[17:46:51] <sammych1> it's not for node
[17:47:00] <sammych1> it's for another platform that uses moz-Rhino
[17:49:48] <snover> i’m sorry
[17:49:55] <spudzee> I have a question concerning media queries
[17:50:23] <sammych1> query about media queries.
[17:50:46] <spudzee> exactly
[17:51:17] <cjohnson> 42
[17:52:09] <spudzee> love that movie/book
[17:52:21] <spudzee> up there in my favs
[17:53:06] <spudzee> trying to find a good example for my question
[17:53:12] <spudzee> well
[17:53:19] <spudzee> not really an example
[17:53:39] <spudzee> okay here we go
[17:55:02] <spudzee> if I am using windows 8 (which I don't condone). And I'm using it on a touch screen monitor that also has a mouse connected to it (which I also don't condone), how does html.touch recognize me?
[17:56:06] <spudzee> am I on a touch screen device or no?
[17:56:20] <spudzee> technically it is touch screen, but also has a mouse
[17:56:45] <cjohnson> do you have a machine to test?
[17:57:42] <spudzee> my Mom has some sort of samsung tablet that is running windows 8 and also has a keyboard and mouse, yet has touch. That's about as close as I can get
[17:58:00] <spudzee> It's in the other room
[17:58:09] <spudzee> I have a plan!
[17:58:41] <spudzee> she's watching TV right now, so if I load my code on a thumb drive, I can take it in there, load it up and test this!
[17:58:52] <spudzee> hopefully without her noticing
[18:08:11] <spudzee> okay, I have another question that might be a bit easier to answer than the last
[18:08:36] <spudzee> actually this is a bit too css for #jquery
[18:50:25] <Yottabyte> Hey guys, how do I select a class that has a element with another class as a child
[18:51:08] <Yottabyte> say .a with a child element (somewhere below) with .b
[18:55:05] <Robdgreat> .a .b
[18:56:29] <Yottabyte> Robotman321 is that a joke
[18:56:53] <Yottabyte> u mean 2 tell me that I can just $('.a .b')
[18:56:59] <Yottabyte> Robdgreat*
[18:57:15] <Robdgreat> that's how it works
[18:57:44] <Robdgreat> if they were immediate children and not just descendants you'd use .a > .b
[18:57:45] <Yottabyte> even if there are 100 child elements of a and the one that has b also has 100 other classes?
[18:57:56] <Robdgreat> yes.
[18:58:00] <Yottabyte> amazing
[18:58:04] <Yottabyte> god bless jquery
[18:58:04] <Robdgreat> they make this a no-brainer
[18:58:26] <Yottabyte> but this selects that proper .a element right?
[18:58:32] <Yottabyte> it just has .b as a child somewhere
[19:14:49] <Yottabyte>  ty
[19:43:44] <kingplusplus> please i want to findout what is the disadvantage of using Bootstrap? I have seen my friends make site I have never been able to attain or make a responsive site. Today I found bootstrap and its like the answer to professional web design. When is bootstrap not advisable please?
[19:54:33] <damarusama> is I append a div to a dom element, the css of the site is not used for that new div
[20:25:38] <frothnicator> I'm trying to utilize onbeforeunload to confirm that a user wants to lose their changes.  This works fine in many browsers, but I'm having a devil of a time figuring out how to do the same on the iPad.  Is there a known workaround that I'm failing to find on google?
[21:29:37] <sammych1> I think this deserves an expletive. ckeditor, which you all seem to jump to recommend, has had a request to add inline style editing to table cells for 7 years

[22:42:34] <Uhkis> :D
[22:59:45] <gtristan> what does $().detach() return, if not the DOM node ?
[23:00:43] <gtristan> a jquery object of the possibly multiple detached elements I suppose, even though it fails to mention this in http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[23:15:22] <Cork> gtristan: jquery always returns a jquery object with the currect element set
[23:15:47] <Cork> gtristan: there is a few exceptions and those say that instead of all of them saying "same as always"
[23:16:08] <gtristan> Cork, thanks, I figured it out, by adding the [0] subscript or using .get (0)
[23:17:19] <Cork> gtristan: but why do you need the dom element?
[23:17:42] <gtristan> strangely I have some convoluted looking stuff though, like: node = $('#tempaltes #templateName'); and then return realNode = $(template[0]).detach ()[0];
[23:17:43] <gtristan> heh
[23:17:56] <gtristan> so many subscripts
[23:18:08] <Cork> uh
[23:18:13] <gtristan> Cork, eh, because I dont need the wrapper ?
[23:18:32] <Cork> gtristan: i doubt you want to detach the template
[23:18:40] <Cork> i suspect you're looking for .clone
[23:18:48] <rocking777> hi.. i am using jquery 1.4 and .on event seems to be unavailble there.. what is alternative to .on() event?
[23:18:54] <gtristan> Cork, no I certainly want to detach the template
[23:19:02] <Cork> rocking777: there isn't one
[23:19:10] <gtristan> Cork, I keep em all in an array and only clone them when I'm about to construct something
[23:19:31] <Cork> rocking777: on is a combination method of the .bind and .delegate functions
[23:19:39] <Cork> and those exist in current versions too
[23:19:51] <gtristan> well, not an array but rather a JS dictionary object
[23:19:54] <rocking777> Cork.. thansk.. let me try with bind then
[23:19:57] <rocking777> in place of .on
[23:20:25] <Cork> gtristan: wrapping and unwrapping the dom element is more costly then just keeping the wrapper though
[23:20:35] <Cork> just so you know
[23:20:42] <gtristan> really
[23:20:46] <gtristan> that is interesting
[23:21:02] <Cork> yes as you create garbage for the collector every time you do
[23:21:21] <Cork> also $(template[0]).detach()[0]; can be reduced to template.detach()[0];
[23:21:22] <gtristan> normally I keep a public this.node on all my objects
[23:21:31] <gtristan> and call jquery alot for basic stuff
[23:21:42] <gtristan> like $(this.node).show() or whatnot
[23:22:00] <gtristan> I suppose I should keep a cached wrapped jquery object around for that instead
[23:22:17] <Cork> ya, but be careful with how you create it
[23:22:22] <Cork> or you can have a memory leak
[23:22:53] <gtristan> hmmm
[23:23:11] <Cork> jquery has a call stack feature that can keep a long list of elements alive indefinitely if you create the object the wrong way
[23:23:43] <gtristan> so if I were to add say, this.jq = $(this.node) in my constructor... it may never go out of scope ?
[23:23:52] <Cork> so ex window.t = $('*').filter('#example')
[23:24:09] <Cork> would keep all elements that existed at the time of that line alive
[23:24:24] <gtristan> ah, cause you put it on window !
[23:24:42] <Cork> well window is just a way to point out it's a global variable
[23:24:52] <gtristan> right
[23:25:04] <Cork> anything that would keep a variable alive would do the same
[23:25:14] <gtristan> lets say for example I have an object with a this.node and a this.jq = $(this.node)
[23:25:23] <Cork> like scope inheriting to an event handler
[23:25:25] <gtristan> and one day I do $(this.node).remove()
[23:25:39] <gtristan> instead of the better this.jq.remove()
[23:25:46] <gtristan> would I leak something there ?
[23:25:52] <Cork> remove just removes the element from dom
[23:26:06] <Cork> until you do this.node = null the element will be kept alive
[23:26:06] <gtristan> right, assuming nothing has references to that node anymore
[23:26:20] <gtristan> ah right of course
[23:26:36] <gtristan> I have something circular in there, and we do have a this.node = null line for that indeed
[23:26:37] <Cork> but my point isn't really that
[23:26:52] <Cork> lets say you do this.t = $('*').filter('#example');
[23:27:09] <gtristan> then that object keeps all the results alive
[23:27:21] <Cork> you can then do this.t.prevObject and have a list of all elements
[23:27:22] * gtristan sorry for interrupting... but that's the idea ?
[23:28:01] <Cork> and this.jq = $('*').filter('#example').children()
[23:28:12] <Cork> would be this.jq.prevObject.prevObject == all elements
[23:28:17] <gtristan> nod, we are very sparing with the actual selectors, and we don't keep them hanging around indefinitely, so I doubt this will be a problem
[23:28:21] <Cork> THAT is the chain im warning about
[23:28:58] <gtristan> Cork, thanks for the warning, I do appreciate it :)
[23:29:06] <gtristan> good to know
[23:29:22] <Cork> so the solution ppl use is: this.jq = $('*').filter('#exmaple'); this.jq.prevObject = null;
[23:29:25] <gtristan> also thanks for the optimization tip
[23:29:37] <gtristan> really
[23:29:40] <Cork> personally i just include a plugin that kills prevObject
[23:30:02] <Cork> i find it a gigantic misfeature
[23:30:35] <Cork> though it means you lose a few functions (.end(), .unwrap() and .fadeTo)
[23:31:12] <gtristan> wow, well, we're certainly not doing stuff like that, any largely permissive selectors are generally one-offs and not stored
[23:32:09] <Cork> gtristan: the '*' is just to make a point
[23:32:19] <gtristan> yes I see
[23:32:21] <Cork> any chained filer/traversal cause this
[23:32:26] <Cork> *filter
[23:32:47] <gtristan> ah
[23:32:52] <Cork> so you should always be careful if you store a jquery variable so it doesn't contain a stack chain
[23:33:08] <gtristan> Cork, but if your not storing it, you dont have a problem right ?
[23:33:28] <Cork> right, as the leak comes from having something keeping removed dom elements alive
[23:33:34] <gtristan> something we do have... is chained stuff like $(this.node).find ('...').each ();
[23:33:51] <gtristan> but in any of these cases, we don't store the result
[23:33:57] <gtristan> (of the find() )
[23:34:24] <Cork> gtristan: though note var v = $().find.each(); ... $('#').on('click', function() {}); will do this too
[23:34:37] <Cork> as v will be kept alive by the event handler
[23:35:02] <Cork> :)
[23:35:05] <Cork> fun isn't it XD
[23:35:18] <gtristan> yeah, that part is a little unclear
[23:35:27] <Cork> scope inheriting
[23:35:32] <Cork> i mentioned it before
[23:35:56] <gtristan> not sure I would (from an implementor POV)... hold a scoped reference to 'v' in a parent scope, unless it's referred to in the event handler function
[23:35:56] <Cork> if the target of the event is removed so the event handler gets removed
[23:36:00] <Cork> the function is dropped
[23:36:09] <Cork> and by that the last reference to the v variable
[23:36:16] <gtristan> that's what I mean, if 'v' is referred to in the nested scope, then certainly it must be kept around
[23:36:39] <Cork> gtristan: well depends on quite a few things
[23:37:03] <Cork> but yes if the engine can be completely sure nothing will every touch it in the inner scope it can release it
[23:37:21] <Cork> but ex. a new Function() or eval makes this completely impossible
[23:37:35] <Cork> and i'm not sure if any engine actually does this currently btw
[23:37:38] <gtristan> at the basics, considering the lispy nature of it, it should certainly be possible
[23:37:41] <gtristan> oh yeah
[23:37:43] <gtristan> Function()
[23:37:46] <gtristan> of course
[23:37:47] <gtristan> heh
[23:38:01] <Cork> the problem is in that javascript is so dynamic
[23:38:15] <Cork> you can extend a scope quite easily
[23:38:30] <Cork> and not to forget things like .callee and caller
[23:38:34] <gtristan> does strict mode prevent this ?
[23:38:41] <Cork> it eases it
[23:38:45] <Cork> but it doesn't prevent it
[23:39:23] <gtristan> wow, no wonder it's such a memory hog ;-)
[23:39:49] <Cork> it is a memory hog if you make a wrong move :)
[23:40:09] <Cork> also jit is a large part of the memory use of js now days
[23:40:31] <gtristan> ah, object member subscripting
[23:40:37] <gtristan> now that complicates things a lot
[23:41:02] <kinesis> can anyone help me fix a jquery problem on my nsfw site?
[23:41:09] <gtristan> how can you know if you can release something in the parent scope if a dynamic word can be used to index it somehow ?
[23:41:17] <Cork> ?ask @ kinesis
[23:41:17] <b-ot> kinesis: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:41:19] <kinesis> http://www.young-girls.com/submit-content/ <- the animated div makes the box-shadow property vanish from the right side of the div
[23:41:23] <kinesis> how do i fix that
[23:41:40] <kinesis> im talking about the white div on the right side on the right side of it, the box-shadow vanishes. how do i fix it?
[23:42:04] <Cork> gtristan: what they use is simple freezing the process and traverse it all, if there is anything pointing to the data it can't be freed
[23:42:33] <Cork> gtristan: this results in sometimes things being kept for too long, and sometimes it getting lost before you can get to it
[23:42:52] <Cork> arguments and async calls in chrome is a good example of the later
[23:43:16] <Cork> so ya, it's a balance
[23:43:24] <gtristan> At least the member nodes of a Function typed node cannot be indexed with a dynamic string like an Object typed node can
[23:43:31] <gtristan> otherwise it would be near impossible
[23:43:57] <Cork> not sure what you mean there, you're not using the normal terms
[23:45:13] <gtristan> no, not familiar with the normal terms, I mean basically, the way I understand JS is a huge tree of nodes, where every node is either a fundamentally typed variable (like String, Boolean, Number), object or function
[23:45:19] <gtristan> they are all basically nodes in a tree
[23:45:34] <gtristan> but they have different properties depending on their type
[23:45:59] <gtristan> like an Object can have it's child nodes indexed with object.membername or object.['dynamic string']
[23:47:44] <Cork> gtristan: that isn't really correct
[23:47:57] <gtristan> subtle difference ?
[23:48:04] <Cork> quite big ones too
[23:48:11] <Cork> you have the dom tree but it isn't really part of js
[23:48:26] <Cork> its just how js interacts with a webpage, if js doesn't run in a webpage you don't have the dom
[23:48:33] <gtristan> right
[23:48:45] <Cork> js it self mainly depends on scope
[23:48:54] <Cork> and it isn't really a tree
[23:49:29] <Cork> and lastly everything in js is an object except for a few basic data types (number and string)
[23:49:52] <Cork> even a function is an object at it's core
[23:50:05] <gtristan> a scope is a node in the tree is it node ? a function can be a scope, creating a branch in that tree, branches can have nodes which hold references to other nodes in other branches in the tree, so long as those nodes have a common scope (common ancestor node in the tree)
[23:50:22] <Cork> no node is the backing of the dom
[23:50:30] <Cork> and again dom isn't part of js
[23:50:39] <gtristan> node is a word in programming
[23:50:40] <Cork> its the api for accessing the page
[23:50:49] <gtristan> refers to an element in a linked list, tree or hash table or such
[23:51:17] <gtristan> I certainly dont mean nodes as in DOM nodes
[23:51:43] <Cork> when the parser hits a scope it checks the current scope and includes the variable references in the current scope when it creates the new scope
[23:52:10] <Cork> so again it isn't really a tree structure
[23:52:38] <gtristan> in other words, a parent scope cannot be cleaned up until all child scopes are freed
[23:52:38] <Cork> variables are anchored in the scope and the execution uses the scope as the namespace
[23:53:06] <Cork> it can but that has to be done by analyzing the code that is "expected" to run in the child scope
[23:53:21] <Cork> and guessing if something there might reference it
[23:53:42] <gtristan> and the guessing comes in because of the dynamic loopholes
[23:53:44] <Cork> then the process can cut the reference to those variables
[23:53:55] <gtristan> if all references were to be explicit, that could not happen
[23:54:07] <Cork> but you would lose much of the power of js
[23:54:20] <Cork> as you couldn't do cross scope variable references
[23:54:59] <gtristan> what would you define as a 'cross scope variable reference', if not a common reference to a variable in a common ancestor scope ?
[23:56:25] <Cork> gtristan: to reference es6: var base = 2; func((x)=>x*base)
[23:56:35] <Cork> that would be problematic to do
[23:57:06] <gtristan> hmmm, me doesnt understand the => operator, or whatever it is :-/
[23:57:21] <Cork> it's basically a one statement function call
[23:57:41] <Cork> function(x) {} becomes (x)=>{}
[23:58:05] <Cork> and (x)=>x*base  is the same as (x)=>{ return x*base; }
[23:58:08] <gtristan> ah, and x*base is what is returned
[23:58:12] <Cork> yes
[23:59:02] <SirLagz> if I define an array outside a $.getJSON, then attempt to modify the array inside the success function of $.getJSON, that should modify the array outside the $.getJSON as well right ?
[23:59:30] <Cork> SirLagz: yes, but ajax is async, so the code after the ajax call will run with the original array
[23:59:44] <SirLagz> Cork: oh right. derp. should have thought of that =/
