[00:00:22] <doug65536> vhsjon: $(document).on('change', '.activeElementDropdown', function(event) { var element = $(event.target; ... })
[00:00:49] <doug65536> missed a )
[00:00:56] <anli> Should I just check if position is absolute?
[00:01:23] <doug65536> vhsjon: if you do that, it will work no matter when you add the class
[00:01:28] <vhsjon> doug65536: so I should set the event on the document, and not on the ".activeElementDropdown" element itself?
[00:01:52] <doug65536> vhsjon: I am assuming that you haven't added that class yet at the moment 'on' is called
[00:02:31] <doug65536> vhsjon: my suggestion sets up a handler for any change events from any elements that have that class
[00:02:42] <doug65536> even if they are created later
[00:03:06] <doug65536> or, rather, even if you add that class later
[00:03:25] <vhsjon> doug65536: I have one dropdown, and when that is changed, I show a new dropdown menu, and then I set the class. So before I have changed the new drop down, which should trigger the .activeElementDropdown change event, I can see in my html that the dropdown in fact have the new class
[00:03:46] <doug65536> vhsjon: ok but WHEN do you call .on('change'...
[00:04:00] <doug65536> before or after the element has that class added
[00:04:05] <vhsjon> after
[00:04:08] <doug65536> ok
[00:04:20] <doug65536> so $('.activeElementDropdown') matches nothing
[00:04:28] <doug65536> therefore, no event handlers are attached
[00:04:45] <vhsjon> $(".ElementDropDown").on("change", function(event) this event sets the activeElementDropdown class, and after that the $(".activeElementDropdown").on("change", function(event) { comes
[00:04:53] <anli> Can I dump all css for an element to the console?
[00:05:28] <vhsjon> doug65536: yeah, thats what it seems like, but in the html, the class is set, thats what I find weird..
[00:06:02] <doug65536> vhsjon: you don't seem to be getting what I am trying to say...
[00:06:20] <doug65536> vhsjon: what would happen if I did: $('.aaaaaaaaaasdfasdfasdasdf').on('change' ....
[00:06:26] <vhsjon> nothing
[00:06:27] <doug65536> nothing
[00:06:55] <doug65536> exactly, so if there are no elements with that class ALREADY when you do $(".activeElementDropdown").on("change" ...
[00:07:03] <doug65536> then it won't attach a handler
[00:07:06] <vhsjon> then it wont trigger
[00:07:07] <vhsjon> ok
[00:07:35] <vhsjon> so, is there any best practice way to handle this? So that I know that the on(change) is called after the class is actually set?
[00:07:44] <doug65536> yes I just told you
[00:07:51] <vhsjon> the document version?
[00:08:00] <doug65536> not necessarily document...
[00:08:06] <doug65536> as long as it is a parent of where that element will end up
[00:08:17] <vhsjon> ok
[00:08:36] <vhsjon> Ill give that a try, thanks for your time, doug65536!
[00:08:44] <doug65536> preferably not all the way up at document, but document isn't bad either
[00:08:45] <doug65536> np
[00:09:15] <doug65536> for a heavily spammed event, like mousemove, document isn't such a good idea
[00:09:47] <vhsjon> yeah,
[00:09:54] <doug65536> vhsjon: note also that $(this) won't behave the same
[00:10:12] <vhsjon> ok, so thats why you use the event.target
[00:10:13] <vhsjon> ?
[00:10:20] <doug65536> vhsjon: you will probably need to take a parameter in your function (event)  and use $(event.target)
[00:10:20] <doug65536> yes
[00:10:51] <vhsjon> nice, thanks
[00:10:55] <vhsjon> it triggers now :)
[00:23:44] <anli> I want to iterate all trs in a table after a sortable operation is finished
[00:23:47] <anli> I get one too many
[00:24:54] <doug65536> anli: is there a thead and tbody (and possibly tfoot) ?
[00:25:19] <anli> lol
[00:25:20] <anli> Thanks
[00:25:57] <anli> How did you figure :)
[00:26:06] <doug65536> "1 too many" was my clue
[00:26:45] <anli> doug65536++
[00:26:52] <anli> Got the right amount of trs now
[00:42:22] <mls_> hi all
[00:43:16] <mls_> I've got a question on those slides http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32, firstpart of the page. What if I want to pass 1 argument with the event ?
[00:46:14] <vhsjon> I have a local .json file with a "Data" key which the value is an array and I fill the array up depending on som euser choices. Basically I do this like this: json.HAZARD.Obs.Fields.Data = ObsArray; In the line after that I can console.dir and see that the data array is filled up. But outside of that function, the data array is always empty. Why is
[00:46:14] <vhsjon>  the values of the array just temporary stored? The json file is just written text...
[00:46:54] <vhsjon> same problem as earlier, maybe...?
[00:49:45] <_rgn> who knows
[00:50:36] <vhsjon> that one was for doug65536
[00:52:45] <doug65536> vhsjon: hard to guess without seeing any code
[00:52:46] <seutje> mls_: you should probably look into using on instead of click (or bind): http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:52:54] <seutje> mls_: especially note the data argument
[00:53:30] <mls_> seutje thanks just found it with eventData object
[00:53:35] <seutje> mls_: note that click also has this, if the first argument to $.fn.click() is an object, it'll be passed on in event.data: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[00:55:03] <doug65536> any ideas why this becomes horribly slow over time? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/
[00:55:06] <mls_> seutje yes that's what I found, accessing through e.data
[00:55:38] <doug65536> it runs awful in jsfiddle... it's faster on my site
[00:56:28] <seutje> doug65536: so many DOM nodes
[00:56:43] <seutje> killing it on the layout events
[00:57:00] <doug65536> I tried to ease the burden of reflows with the explicit widths
[00:57:09] <doug65536> do you think it is possible to make the reflows easy for it?
[00:57:20] <seutje> queue em up
[00:57:31] <seutje> is there a need to update rendering so often?
[00:57:44] <doug65536> dynamically adjust the batch size?
[00:57:58] <doug65536> I do it with a timeout loop because it hangs for a long time without that
[00:58:11] <vhsjon> doug65536: True :) Here is the json file that i Want to update: http://pastebin.com/y0WmJ9nT - and the two methods which saves to json file and then tries to read from it: http://pastebin.com/drY4Zemt
[00:58:28] <seutje> ur telling it like "yo, figure out how to reorder these 100k nodes for me" like multiple times per second
[00:58:52] <seutje> doug65536: I mean do ur dom manip in 1 go
[00:58:56] <doug65536> seutje: even if I slam the entire table into innerHTML all at once it hangs the browser (chrome) for a VERY long time
[00:59:15] <vhsjon> doug65536: in the populateObservationValues  method where I set the data array, I can console.dir and see that the array is filled up, but in the showFieldsForObservation method under, the data array is empty
[00:59:18] <doug65536> and it generates the HTML in a fraction of a second
[00:59:36] <seutje> yeah, parsing the HTML isn't the problem
[00:59:40] <seutje> figuring out the layout is
[01:00:08] <doug65536> seutje: I know, which is why I asked if someone knew a way to make it easy to compute the flow
[01:01:03] <doug65536> vhsjon: yes that is just a parameter being passed - it goes out of scope when that callback returns
[01:01:37] <doug65536> vhsjon: you would need to store that json out to something in a higher scope to keep it
[01:02:03] <doug65536> vhsjon: also, that isn't modifying the json file btw
[01:02:11] <seutje> doug65536: it's calling .prop a ton of times cause of the autoscroll
[01:02:34] <vhsjon> doug65536: so If I do the getJSON call outside of the method, I can use it in the other method?
[01:03:04] <seutje> still slows down pretty quickly after disabling the prop call
[01:03:11] <doug65536> vhsjon: you would need to pass in an object, store into a property of that, then you can pass that object around and everyone shares it
[01:03:14] <vhsjon> doug65536: ok, thats what I figured, do I have to JSON.parse, update object, and then JSON.stringify?
[01:03:28] <vhsjon> ok
[01:04:13] <_rgn> getJSON does the parsing
[01:05:00] <doug65536> seutje: jsfiddle kills the perf somehow. try this one http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/show/
[01:05:09] <doug65536> or add /show to whatever one you want
[01:05:37] <seutje> the speed is erradic as poo
[01:05:38] <doug65536> seutje: it starts out at about 8500 per second on my machine... and rapidly falls below 3000
[01:05:52] <seutje> swinging between 300 and 2500 for me
[01:06:55] <doug65536> hey I wonder if a selector profile would say anything in chrome
[01:07:04] <seutje> doug65536: disabling the autoscroll already vastly improves it for me
[01:07:57] <doug65536> I can't believe how awful browsers are with huge documents...
[01:08:11] <doug65536> I am trying to learn how to make them run fast with a huge document
[01:10:00] <doug65536> insertBefore should be the fastest way to append, right?
[01:10:18] <seutje> iono
[01:10:39] <doug65536> I vaguely remember testing it and finding append was O(n)
[01:10:52] <doug65536> maybe it was just reflow getting bad
[01:11:04] <seutje> prolly faster if u do like 5 rows at once
[01:11:14] <doug65536> I do 256 at a time
[01:11:18] <doug65536> 16 rows at a time
[01:11:39] <doug65536> the code that generates the html flies...
[01:11:46] <doug65536> it can do the whole thing in a fraction of a second
[01:12:45] <doug65536> there are no string concatenations in the html generation loop (string concatenation is slow as molasses in chrome)
[01:12:56] <seutje> ur calling insertbefore every 16 ms
[01:13:18] <doug65536> no, there is a 16ms delay between each batch of 16 rows
[01:13:55] <doug65536> right?
[01:14:16] <seutje> looks to me like doSome is called every 16 ms and doSome called insertbefore
[01:14:19] <seutje> calls*
[01:14:31] <doug65536> it is setTimeout, not setInterval
[01:14:55] <seutje> so?
[01:15:23] <doug65536> so it means that there is 16ms of idle time between calls to doSome
[01:15:27] <doug65536> capping it at 60 calls per second
[01:15:48] <seutje> u need this at 60 fps?
[01:15:51] <doug65536> as the loop slows down doSome ends up being called every (doSome time + 16)
[01:16:02] <doug65536> ms
[01:16:26] <seutje> I don't see how this is related
[01:16:35] <seutje> granted, it's not exactly 16 ms
[01:16:36] <doug65536> I have it at 16 so it doesn't become so unresponsive that I have to kill it
[01:16:42] <seutje> but it's still a fuckload of times
[01:16:50] <seutje> if u need 60 fps, don't use 7 million dom nodes
[01:17:09] <doug65536> don't you see what it is doing? it is doing it "in the background"
[01:17:15] <doug65536> instead of hanging for a few minutes
[01:17:30] <doug65536> I should use setTimeout(doSome, 1)
[01:17:34] <seutje> I'm not saying to lower it
[01:17:52] <doug65536> or 0
[01:17:57] <seutje> sure
[01:18:09] <doug65536> the bottleneck is the reflow
[01:18:28] <seutje> so ur gonna trigger it more?
[01:18:37] <doug65536> no
[01:19:25] <doug65536> I meant, ideally, there wouldn't be a delay - I have it there so I don't hang the tab
[01:19:29] <seutje> same amount of dom manip for same amount of data will probably lead to the same amount of layout events
[01:19:54] <doug65536> change c = 1024 on line 15
[01:19:57] <seutje> thing is, there aren't only a jillion of them, but they're pretty brutal cause ur in a table with a million nodes
[01:20:06] <doug65536> it will do 1024 per DOM insertion
[01:21:08] <doug65536> can't I do something to make it "easy" for it to reflow though?
[01:21:24] <doug65536> a million is nothing for a modern cpu. what is it doing a million times?!
[01:22:06] <seutje> tables are hard, man
[01:22:06] <doug65536> it builds a million nodes of html in a split second, with all those joins and string-to-hex conversions, etc
[01:22:59] <seutje> most things that handle huge tables do some sort of paging, albeit hidden
[01:23:09] <imjakechapman> hey guys.. Probably a newbie question.. But I keep seeing a 'dist' folder in a lot of repos. Anyone care to explain what 'Dist' is?
[01:23:22] <doug65536> if you disable the dom insertion and make the setTimeout 0, it does 60000 per second
[01:23:28] <imjakechapman> or does it just a short name for Distribution or something?
[01:23:29] <seutje> ever check out the 1-page html5 spec?
[01:23:49] <seutje> that wasn't even doing any heavy manipulation
[01:24:35] <doug65536> that's the funny thing...
[01:24:44] <seutje> imjakechapman: yeah, pretty much
[01:24:47] <doug65536> if it was a static htm file with a million nodes it would load fine
[01:25:00] <imjakechapman> sweet deal. seutje, thanks. :)
[01:25:04] <doug65536> if I put a million node string into innerHTML, sucks
[01:25:04] <seutje> untill u change 1 cell in there
[01:25:28] <seutje> tables are very inner-connected or however u say it
[01:25:29] <imjakechapman> cause now I'm seeing it show up in things like Grunt.js etc and curious if I need to know what the name stood for something in the future.
[01:26:25] <seutje> btw, turning off autoscroll and setting it to 1024 made it average 5k/s
[01:26:43] <seutje> until you scroll, of course
[01:28:37] <doug65536> seutje: do you think a bunch of rows of <span> with <br> at the end would go tons faster?
[01:29:08] <seutje> prolly better off with DIVs then, but yeah, it very well might
[01:29:24] <doug65536> with a table I realize, it has to resize every row just in case the new things changed cell width
[01:29:36] <seutje> exactly
[01:29:58] <seutje> divs are just separate blocks, that only influence eachother as a whole
[01:30:21] <seutje> as in, if an entire block disappears, only then do the succeeding blocks need to be changed
[01:30:29] <seutje> and not also all the preceding
[01:33:54] <doug65536> seutje: way faster with spans http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/2/
[01:34:46] <doug65536> seutje: divs would probably be good too, but they are display: block by default
[01:34:55] <seutje> yeah, that's why
[01:35:00] <doug65536> I suppose I could make all divs display: inline-block to test
[01:36:00] <seutje> doug65536: I meant divs for the rows instead of a br
[01:36:11] <doug65536> ah
[01:36:30] <seutje> now it's still a really long inline string that just happens to have line breaks :P
[01:36:44] <doug65536> true
[01:39:10] <doug65536> flies now http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/4/
[01:39:59] <doug65536> interesting, slows to a crawl at 0xa0000
[01:40:07] <doug65536> maybe hammering the font cache really hard?
[01:41:05] <doug65536> oh I forgot to update the html. oops
[01:43:27] <doug65536> seutje: wow, check this out http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/7/
[01:43:37] <doug65536> flies until about 0xa0000 then slows to a crawl
[01:45:03] <seutje> yeah, took a lil dip, but went back to 20k/s
[01:45:15] <seutje> wait, the dip was way before 0xa0000
[01:45:27] <doug65536> seutje: what OS?
[01:45:29] <seutje> once it hits the ?
[01:45:37] <seutje> once it hits the ?'s, it shot up to 40k/s
[01:45:41] <seutje> OSX
[01:45:54] <doug65536> I'm on linux, it started crawling at 0xa0000
[01:45:58] <seutje> oh wait, it's done
[01:46:18] <seutje> last it noted was 36499.01
[01:46:24] <doug65536> is it choppy when you use scrollbar?
[01:47:13] <rottenTi> hello
[01:47:19] <rottenTi> where is that guy whose name starts with S ?
[01:47:41] <doug65536> rottenTi:  that doesn't narrow it down a lot
[01:47:57] <rottenTi> doug65536: the guy with whoom I talked yesterday
[01:48:12] <seutje> doug65536: not at al
[01:48:14] <seutje> all*
[01:48:22] <doug65536> seutje: ok cool, thanks
[01:48:32] <doug65536> I guess giant tables are hopeless?
[01:48:36] <seutje> yeah
[01:48:40] <seutje> always have been
[01:49:35] <doug65536> probably a good reason to use "css-faked" tables
[01:49:40] <seutje> like I said, usually when I see ppl handle large tables smoothly, they're removing the stuff that isn't on-screen or have some other way of keeping the on-screen stuff separate
[01:50:34] <doug65536> seutje: ah, a bit like deferred image loaders - empty the content of cells far offscreen
[01:50:43] <seutje> damn, just hit 90k/s
[01:51:09] <seutje> doug65536: or maybe even go as far as removeing the entire rows
[01:51:22] <doug65536> seutje: but won't that screw up the scrollbar?
[01:51:22] <seutje> but writing reliable logic for that might be tricky
[01:51:32] <seutje> u can pad the missing space with a single element
[01:51:38] <doug65536> ah right
[01:51:50] <doug65536> just one "master" giant height row to cover for them
[01:52:00] <seutje> yeah
[01:55:24] <doug65536> seutje: doing 16384 per insertion I hit 166k / sec :D
[01:55:51] <doug65536> yeah, divs are definitely the way to go
[01:55:53] <seutje> baller!
[01:56:00] <seutje> canvas would probably be way faster
[01:56:12] <seutje> but yeah, I assume there's a reason u want proper text
[01:56:26] <doug65536> maybe, but canvas text quality is a bad joke from 1980 in chrome
[01:58:32] <AlexanderBB10> godmorgon
[01:58:44] <seutje> hej

[01:59:28] <doug65536> :)
[01:59:29] <_pingu> is there a method like scrollIntoView( { direction : vertical + 40px})?
[02:00:08] <doug65536> _pingu: $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: n})

[02:00:35] <doug65536> _pingu: where 'n' is whatever you get for target.offset().top
[02:01:52] <doug65536> will a 6 year old plugin work?
[02:02:25] <slax0r> if you use a 6year old jquery, then you have high chances
[02:03:01] <seutje> doug65536: 4 months old: https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo
[02:03:09] <doug65536> ok good
[02:03:53] <seutje> syntax just hasn't really changed, so the post is still relevant
[02:04:02] <seutje> which is sort of a feat in itself, in this industry
[02:09:00] <doug65536> seutje: check out my partially finished jsfiddle clone http://shye.snhdns.com/~phon/shelledit.php

[02:12:06] <|Freeman|> is it possible to add an empty attribute on an element with jQuery, like for example, just required instead of required='required' ?
[02:13:43] <Cork> |Freeman|: dom can't have that
[02:14:21] <Cork> |Freeman|: required gets converted to required="" in dom
[02:14:52] <doug65536> in jquery $('p').attr('required', ''); makes it <p required="required">...

[02:21:29] <seutje> doug65536: not sure if we need another one of those :P
[02:21:49] <_pingu> doug65536: intresting. and how do i add +100 ?
[02:22:26] <doug65536> _pingu: add it to .top. although, you probably want -100
[02:22:42] <doug65536> _pingu: +100 would scroll it 100px off the top of the window
[02:22:58] <_pingu> doug65536: yeah. thats it. thanks!
[02:23:01] <_pingu> :-)
[02:24:55] <doug65536> seutje: yeah, I know. I had a couple if ideas. like importing existing sites, having ways to add css frameworks as well as jquery frameworks. lots of existing jquery plugins to pick, multiple layouts for the editors, etc
[02:26:41] <doug65536> seutje: and a way to search. I hate not being able to search my fiddles
[02:29:03] <seutje> I never even log in of fiddle
[02:29:15] <seutje> I like how jsbin allows u to choose the url if it isn't taken already
[02:44:10] <WarDekar> i'm getting a jquery error: "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'map' "
[02:44:21] <WarDekar> but the object i'm trying to call .map on if i do it in the console it works fine
[02:45:22] <seutje> WarDekar: got code?
[03:05:26] <keirlav87> I've got some draggable and resizable text, and on each interaction the top and left offset of the text is captured so that I can rebuild the final image later
[03:05:48] <keirlav87> the problem is that the text within the p tag who's offset I am capturing isn't flush against the boundary of the P
[03:06:07] <keirlav87> is there a way to get the offset of the first character of the text relative to its parent p tag?
[03:07:17] <seutje> keirlav87: line-height?
[03:07:25] <seutje> text indent
[03:07:48] <seutje> letter-spacing doesn't affect the first char, right?
[03:08:53] <keirlav87> sorry i'm alittle unclear on what your saying, the text-indent value of the p tag will tell me the pixel offset of the text?
[03:11:29] <keirlav87> no, that doesn't work sorry
[03:20:28] <seutje> keirlav87: depending if u want the x or y offset, it'll be either text-indent or line-height
[03:20:35] <seutje> apart from the obvious padding and border and stuff
[03:20:58] <keirlav87> no, it's not a property defined by a css style or anything like that
[03:21:17] <keirlav87> more of a discrepancy that the text doesnt sit flush against it's containing P tag
[03:24:18] <seutje> okay man, but for me the text starts where the p starts, unless I add css
[03:27:55] <jost> I'm searching for some jQuery plugin, that shows some kind of "log" in the frontend. So my application would send messages to it with a level attached, and the logger would then display these messages in some DIV, filtered by the current logging level. The entries should be able to be filtered. Does someone know such a thing? Googeling is hard on this topic...
[03:32:14] <Tumulte> hey !
[03:32:45] <Tumulte> I'm trying to get a part of an ajax request... and damn, can't manage to do it
[03:33:05] <Cork> Tumulte: post the code at jsfiddle.net
[03:35:28] <Tumulte> here's the code :http://paste.debian.net/42913/
[03:35:32] <Tumulte> http://paste.debian.net/42913/
[03:36:08] <Cork> Tumulte: what is 'main' ?
[03:36:15] <Cork> in the data that is
[03:36:33] <Cork> i suspect you want '#main'
[03:36:42] <Tumulte> Cork: <main>
[03:36:58] <Tumulte> Cork: <main id="container">
[03:36:58] <Cork> ah, right the new tag...
[03:37:04] <Tumulte> indeed :)
[03:37:41] <Cork> Tumulte: ok, and what fails?
[03:38:32] <Tumulte> Cork: console.debug($('main',data).html()) == null
[03:38:48] <Tumulte> therefore, it empties my page
[03:38:56] <Cork> Tumulte: what is the html structure in data?
[03:39:03] <Cork> (don't care about the text)
[03:39:23] <Tumulte> Cork: how do I get that ?
[03:39:34] <Cork> Tumulte: look into the browsers net/network ab
[03:39:40] <Cork> and look at the response content
[03:39:49] <Cork> ab==tab
[03:40:32] <Cork> the reason i ask i cause if <main> is the outer most element, find will fail
[03:41:08] <Tumulte> Cork: http://paste.debian.net/42915/
[03:46:01] <Cork> Tumulte: try $(data).filter('main').html()
[03:46:37] <Cork> Tumulte: dom doesn't hold anything outside body by default, so $(data) will give the <main> as the list of elements
[03:48:15] <Tumulte> Cork: I figured something like that out of what you told, but wasn't aware of this or filter
[03:48:24] <Tumulte> Cork: it works now !
[03:48:30] <Tumulte> so many thanks
[03:48:37] <Cork> Tumulte: filter takes the array of matches in jquery
[03:48:49] <Cork> and loops over them and filters out the ones that matches the selector
[03:48:53] <Cork> kinda like grep
[03:49:00] <Cork> (if you know how that one works)
[03:51:46] <clime> what this means? $('form#some-id *[name]') ?
[03:52:02] <clime> i dont understand the star ter
[03:52:04] <clime> *there
[03:53:29] <Cork> match all elements
[03:54:05] <Cork> clime: to split it up
[03:54:21] <Cork> 'form#some-id *[name]' means match all elements with the tag name "form"
[03:54:29] <clime> $('form#some-id [name]') has the same meaning or not?
[03:54:35] <Cork> clime: then it filters those based on a hash of known id's (some-id)
[03:54:41] <Cork> (note this is a BAD idea)
[03:54:51] <Cork> then it in it looks for all elements with an attribute name
[03:55:02] <Cork> clime: and yes [name] implies *[name]
[03:55:51] <Cork> clime: so remove the form in that selector and it would be better
[03:55:58] <clime> wait, 'form#some-id *[name]'  are all elements with name in form#some-id right?
[03:56:03] <Cork> no
[03:56:08] <clime> oO
[03:56:26] <Cork> i looks through the dom for all elements with the tagName form
[03:56:29] <Cork> as in <form>
[03:56:37] <Cork> and THEN if filters based on it's id hash
[03:56:48] <Cork> instead of just doing a hash lookup for the id
[03:57:06] <Cork> never ever use tag names infronts of an id
[03:57:14] <Cork> id's are unique
[03:57:22] <Cork> so they can ever only be one element
[03:57:45] <clime> allright but thats "how it's done", "what it does" should be what I said, right? ("all elements with name in form#some-id")
[03:57:52] <Cork> yes
[03:58:00] <clime> ok, cool, thank you
[03:58:26] <clime> ill stop using something#id and use just #id then
[03:59:17] <phrearch> hey
[04:00:39] <phrearch> anyone knows of an example how to properly save a base64 image source from jsdom to disk?
[04:03:22] <Tumulte> Cork: yep grep's been my friend for a long time ! Thanks again
[04:13:14] <jost> is api.jquery.com down?
[04:13:50] <seutje> ?down api.jquery.com
[04:13:51] <b-ot> seutje: It's just you. http://api.jquery.com is up! (200 OK)
[04:14:54] <jost> :(
[04:15:00] <clime> jost: check your computer time
[04:16:11] <jost> clime: time is fine - what would that have to do with it?
[04:16:58] <clime> jost: e.g. well google apis stop working if the time is wrong due to certifikate validation
[04:17:08] <clime> *certificate
[04:18:02] <jost> ok, but that would trigger an invalid certificate notification. Thats not the problem... also, all other sites work well. And pinging api.jquery.com works also.
[04:20:00] <clime> jost: that is quite weird xD
[04:21:37] <jost> looks like the site is answering, but with an astonishing speed of about 800 Bytes per second :-)

[04:27:55] <airdem> how can i create a jquery dialog thats hidden and gets visible after i do smth like dialog('show') ?
[04:29:12] <airdem> i cant find a function that i can run before the dialog gets visible
[04:30:16] <airdem> autoOpen ... i was blind
[04:32:57] <airdem> is there a way to tell jquery to wait until a codeblock has been executed and then run a specific function afterwards?
[04:33:20] <bobdobbs> in jquery, how do cycle an sequence of events without a plugin?
[04:33:53] <bobdobbs> Also, without permanently blocking execution?
[04:34:09] <airdem> bobdobbs, trigger() ?
[04:34:25] <bobdobbs> airdem: thanks. checking that out now...
[04:38:24] <dreamreal> hi all - I have a JQm site that isn't applying styles, although the grid layout seems to be working okay
[04:38:29] <dreamreal> ajax calls work, so jquery is active, but I get no UI styling in terms of pretty buttons
[04:38:42] <dreamreal> the columns render properly, the CSS url is returning 200 (and the data)...
[04:38:51] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: Did you edit the CSS file in any way?
[04:38:52] <dreamreal> and I get the same behavior in firefox and chrome
[04:39:01] <dreamreal> _|Nix|_: not the JQM stylesheet, no
[04:39:11] <dreamreal> I added some attributes for my own classes in another stylesheet
[04:39:36] <airdem> i want to run line 10 after the previous code has been executed https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6622149 any ideas?
[04:40:28] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: Well, I have no idea what could be going wrong, but one universal approach to such a problem is to start from scratch and slowly paste in bits and pieces until the styling breaks.
[04:40:46] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: Then you'll know what broke it.
[04:41:04] <dreamreal> _|Nix|_: *nod* yeah, I should... it's just weird because it was working.. then not, and no code had changed :/
[04:41:46] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: *shrug*
[04:42:13] <dreamreal> yeah, I'm with you. Didn't know if there was a handy "you should have done THIS, you moron" in play :)
[04:42:49] <_|Nix|_> dreamreal: Afraid none that I know of :)
[04:42:58] <dreamreal> thanks :)
[04:44:57] <airdem> .click(deleteDialog); how can i pass a parameter to deleteDialog function?
[04:45:07] <seutje> airdem: holy global scope
[04:45:23] <seutje> airdem: if the first argument is an object, it'll be passed as event.data
[04:45:30] <seutje> ?jqapi click
[04:45:45] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[04:46:19] <seutje> airdem: also, is there a reason you are doing window['foo'](), instead of just window.foo()?
[04:46:48] <airdem> nope
[04:52:31] <airdem> seutje, so in deleteDialog i can acces the clicks $(this) via event.data?
[04:52:47] <seutje> sry, what?
[04:52:58] <seutje> u can either way
[04:53:20] <airdem> .click(updateDialog); how do i access $(this) in updateDialog
[04:53:50] <seutje> say u got this: var deleteDialog = function(e) { this === e.target } $('.foo').click(deleteDialog)
[04:54:10] <seutje> airdem: "$(this)" is meaningless without knowing the context
[04:54:26] <seutje> do you mean the this in the function that calls .click() or in the handler?
[04:54:56] <airdem> click(function() {$(this)});
[04:55:00] <airdem> that one
[04:58:57] <airdem> seutje, $(this).find('.create').click(updateDialog); i need to pass $(this) to updateDialog
[04:59:17] <airdem> actually
[04:59:24] <airdem> i need ot pass  $(this).find('.create')
[04:59:34] <xhoy> hi! i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/pRbmR/4/
[04:59:47] <xhoy> the problem now is, i do this on a page with 2000 items
[04:59:56] <seutje> airdem: the entire set? cause you already have direct access to the one that was actually clicked
[05:00:08] <xhoy> i would love to load those items 'hidden'  and then ' remove'  the hidden part
[05:00:15] <airdem> seutje, how?
[05:00:32] <xhoy> i could just simply add a 'hidden'  class and toggle that, but i tought, maby there is some 'default'  fix for this?
[05:00:33] <airdem> how do i have access to it?
[05:00:34] <seutje> airdem: as "this" or as "e.target"
[05:01:45] <airdem> seutje, okay and how can i make sure that $(this) in updateDialog will be the same whether i load it via window.updateDialog(this) or .click(updateDialog) ?
[05:01:51] <xhoy> http://jsfiddle.net/pRbmR/5/
[05:05:28] <seutje> airdem: pass the correct this?
[05:05:35] <seutje> no wait
[05:05:45] <seutje> window.updateDialog({target:this})
[05:06:01] <seutje> but that would asplode anything that does preventDefault or anything else on the actual event object
[05:06:09] <seutje> ur better off just triggering it
[05:07:17] <seutje> at least then ur still catching an event
[05:07:19] <airdem> if ($(this).hasClass('create')) window.updateDialog({ target:this }); does not seem to be the correct this
[05:07:29] <seutje> u can also create bogus event with jQuery.Event
[05:07:54] <seutje> airdem: well no, then u'd have to use e.target in the handler
[05:08:15] <seutje> or you could just window.updateDialog.call(this)
[05:08:21] <seutje> and forget about the event argument
[05:08:35] <seutje> although then u can no longer preventDefault it without checking for it first
[05:09:06] <mdurao> Hello, can someone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/cDLNM/ ... how can I delegate/bind the method selectpicker() to all collections of $('.selectpicker') present in the DOM and in the future?
[05:09:17] <airdem> seutje, .call(this) is working
[05:09:32] <AlexanderBB10> Bind.. Torture and Kill :)
[05:11:45] <mdurao> probably it's so easy to do that I just can see it... :\
[05:14:41] <erry> can i use .on to attach an event to a group of elements that doesn[t currently exist but will be created in the future?
[05:14:49] <erry> i was looking at the deprecated .live() :p
[05:15:01] <grafi> erry you can
[05:15:04] <grafi> and should
[05:15:06] <grafi> :)
[05:15:53] <erry> either i'm doing it wrong or it's not working though :D
[05:16:21] <seutje> mdurao: if the second argument to .on is a function, it assumed u don't want to pass a selector
[05:16:40] <seutje> mdurao: just putting an extra comma there just throws a syntax error
[05:17:25] <grafi> $(parentOfElemsThatArentThereYet).on('click', '.classOfElemThatIsntThereYet', function() {}); << erry, something like that
[05:17:35] <mdurao> seutje: true... that was typo!
[05:17:56] <soee> hi, how can i prevent form submit if submit button is disabled ?
[05:19:00] <mdurao> $('#form').on("submit", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[05:19:29] <BillCriswell> Can a form even be submitted if the submit button id disabled?
[05:19:38] <BillCriswell> s/id/is
[05:19:54] <erry> grafi, ooooh that works, thankie :D
[05:19:54] <seutje> mdurao: $(function(){})() <- lose the () at the end, $(fn) returns an object, not a function
[05:20:13] <grafi> yw
[05:20:27] <mdurao> seutje: okie.
[05:22:21] <airdem> seutje, thank you for helping
[05:22:24] <BillCriswell> soee: $('form').on('submit', function(e){ if($('.submit-button-or-whatever').prop('disabled')) { e.preventDefault(); } }); will do what I think you want. Just aran a test.
[05:24:45] <krambiorix> Hi, i wrote some code to filter elements based on an input box, but when searching the results are shown/hidden very slow.. Is it possible to make this faster ? http://pastebin.com/L2En1URs
[05:26:48] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: How slow are we talking?
[05:27:00] <grafi> how many elements are we talking oô
[05:28:33] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: What you're doing here doesn't seem like it shoud be slow. Can speed it up a bit by doing var $this = $(this) so you're not calling $() so much.
[05:29:43] <seutje> can't you just containers.not(':contains("' + $("#searchcontainerfield").val().toLowerCase() + '")').hide(); ?
[05:30:00] <seutje> or rather containers.hide().not(':contains("' + $("#searchcontainerfield").val().toLowerCase() + '")').hide();
[05:30:10] <seutje> damnit. one of those had to be show :P
[05:30:28] <krambiorix> BillCriswell,  grafi , seutje   , 350 elements , takes 10 secs
[05:31:12] <grafi> seems crazy slow
[05:31:31] <krambiorix> yeah
[05:31:58] <grafi> can you make a jsfiddle with the html so we can try it?
[05:32:32] <grafi> i have done some filtering/searching before and I think it was way faster for more elements
[05:32:34] <grafi> ...
[05:32:42] <krambiorix> this is how a container element looks like http://pastebin.com/Z0zKbxgj
[05:32:52] <krambiorix> grafi, sure
[05:35:24] <krambiorix> grafi, it doesn't work :s http://jsfiddle.net/j5N9z/
[05:36:33] <grafi> thats not 350 elements ^^
[05:37:37] <seutje> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/rqued/1/ pretty speedy, but I guess the markup is kinda simple
[05:38:00] <krambiorix> grafi, this one is not 350 elemnts indeed
[05:38:26] <krambiorix> seutje, could that be the culprit?
[05:38:38] <grafi> i dont think so
[05:38:41] <seutje> iono
[05:38:52] <grafi> i doesnt help of course
[05:39:06] <grafi> but it shouldnt be responsible for 10second lagg
[05:39:24] <krambiorix> grafi, you have the lag too?
[05:39:27] <zim> Hi all. Not sure what its called to google for it. I have seen some sites that use ajax to load content but keep the browser link bar updated with the correct location. What should I Google for?
[05:39:28] <krambiorix> wit my code?
[05:39:41] <grafi> the code thats not working? ^^
[05:39:51] <DRSK> Can I somehow find out the outerHeight() of an element when it doesn't have any height specified but only max-height?
[05:40:13] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/j5N9z/1/ still pretty speedy imo
[05:40:21] <zim> DRSK: $(this).height();
[05:40:40] <krambiorix> seutje, what did you change?!
[05:40:43] <seutje> krambiorix: also, better to go for keyup than change on textfields
[05:40:51] <seutje> krambiorix: the ID and the event type
[05:40:55] <DRSK> zim » thing is, I have a header and within it a slider, and this slider is not counted for when doing outerHeight() on the header, you mean it will if I use height()?
[05:41:13] <seutje> there's no #quicknav in the page
[05:41:23] <seutje> krambiorix: might wanna debounce that handler though
[05:41:37] <seutje> no need to poll 17 times when you've got a genuine typist on ur hands
[05:41:40] <zim> DRSK: to get the DRSK add overflow hidden to the container in css
[05:41:42] <krambiorix> seutje, oooow yeah
[05:42:02] <krambiorix> seutje, how do you mean debounce that handler?
[05:42:17] <seutje> ?g debounce
[05:42:18] <b-ot> seutje: What is debouncing? - Definition from WhatIs.com → http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/debouncing
[05:42:23] <DRSK> zim » it already is
[05:42:30] <seutje> basically, make sure it isn't called more than once every x ms
[05:42:39] <zim> DRSK: show me
[05:42:53] <seutje> so like if the user types a second char within say... 50ms, don't bother updating, and wait till he's done typing
[05:43:09] <seutje> once he's stopped typing for 50ms, then you update
[05:43:42] <grafi> debouncing is a good idea, I would really like to see the lagg though :P
[05:43:51] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: I wanted to give this a shot.. This seems pretty fast though. http://jsbin.com/AraYUvE/2/edit?js,output
[05:44:27] <grafi> BillCriswell <3
[05:44:28] <grafi> :P
[05:44:37] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, thanks, but solved already
[05:44:43] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Awesome.
[05:44:47] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha
[05:45:44] <krambiorix> seutje, you mean $.debounce() , right?
[05:46:10] <seutje> krambiorix: yeah, or any other debounce helper
[05:46:59] <mink>  Hi guys. Any idea how make from string "foo.bar.baz" ===> ['foo']['bar']['baz'] in properly way?
[05:47:32] <Cork> mink: split('.')
[05:47:45] <Cork> won't give you [][][] though
[05:48:18] <Cork> var sections = "foo.bar.baz".split('.'); [sections[0]][sections[1]][sections[2]]
[05:48:41] <duckgoose> o__O
[05:48:50] <grafi> O__o
[05:48:53] <mink> :<
[05:49:03] <duckgoose> var stuff = new Array("foo","bar"m"baz");
[05:49:15] <Cork> duckgoose: not the same
[05:49:17] <mink> :)
[05:49:21] <mink> thanks guys :)
[05:49:33] <duckgoose> ah well
[05:49:47] <Cork> notice the ][ between the values :)
[05:50:33] <Cork> you can't even store ['foo']['bar']['baz'] in a variable so... :)
[05:50:44] <Cork> hmm actually
[05:51:39] <Cork> mink: var sections = "foo.bar.baz".split('.'); eval("var['" + sections.join("']['") + "']"))
[05:51:40] <Cork> :)
[05:51:53] <Cork> would argue that it is horrible though :D
[05:52:13] <Cork> * eval("var['" + "foo.bar.baz".split('.').join("']['") + "']"))
[05:52:18] <mink> Cork I looking for way to execute   window['foo'][bar']("args");
[05:52:25] <Cork> ya
[05:52:36] <mink> Oh thats it. Thanks man :)
[05:52:41] <Cork> eval("var['" + "foo.bar.baz".split('.').join("']['") + "']")) <-- this will do it, and a lot of other ugly things
[05:52:49] <Cork> mink: please don't use eval...
[05:53:02] <Cork> it was a joke...
[05:53:10] <mink> :<
[05:53:32] <mink> I want use sth like this >  window['foo'][bar']("args");
[05:54:03] <krambiorix> seutje, grafi , BillCriswell, i forgot::: thanks!!
[05:54:05] <Cork> you could build a recursive function that takes the target object and an array
[05:54:10] <badmaashh> hello, will this function execute if #banner does not exist ? http://pastebin.com/4FFuWJCw
[05:54:13] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[05:54:19] <Cork> mink: though the first solution is prob the cleanest you will get
[05:54:24] <grafi> Some problem.
[05:54:29] <BillCriswell> I'm supposed to be getting ready for work. =(
[05:54:31] <mink> Cork, I've string like "Foo.bar()" and I want to execute this function from stirng
[05:54:42] <Cork> mink: ...
[05:54:54] <Cork> mink: then you are basically wanting to do eval...
[05:54:55] <sekyms> Anyone a handlebars ninja?
[05:55:15] <Cork> mink: why are you sending a string and not just the function as a reference?
[05:55:56] <mink> Cork, I get string with function name from <div data-func="funcname()">
[05:56:18] <Cork> mink: why not just have data-func="funcname" ?
[05:56:50] <Cork> then you can just call window.functions[$(this).data('func')]();
[05:57:13] <Cork> taken that the function is assigned to the functions global object that is
[05:57:16] <mink> Cork, yes! Exactly. But problem is if data('func') have dots inside :)
[05:57:20] <mink> like Foo.bar.baz()
[05:57:28] <Cork> mink: that was kinda the point
[05:57:31] <Cork> skip that
[05:57:36] <DRSK> can I store a global var in one .js and use it in another ?
[05:57:49] <Cork> that implies object references, and becomes scary kinda easy
[05:58:07] <Cork> DRSK: js don't have file/resource scope
[05:58:08] <BillCriswell> var _call = "Foo.bar()".replace(/\(\)/, '').split('.'); window[_call[0]][_call[1]](); maybe?
[05:58:20] <BillCriswell> Just kidding. I'd start a ruckus if I came across that.
[05:58:39] <Cork> well the () could be left out how ever you do it
[05:58:49] <Cork> and then just a split('.') should be enough
[05:59:00] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ah, didn't know.
[05:59:40] <Cork> BillCriswell: well i'm basically trying to argu that the format things are stored is the problem, and you tried solving that problem :)
[05:59:58] <BillCriswell> Cork: I totally agree.
[06:00:05] <Cork> the problem is having random js in atttributes, opens you up for xss
[06:00:19] <Cork> and... can be messy quite fast
[06:01:10] <badmaashh> hello, will this function execute if #banner does not exist ? http://pastebin.com/4FFuWJCw
[06:01:31] <Cork> badmaashh: yes
[06:01:37] <Cork> cause if it doesn't exist length == 0
[06:01:45] <Cork> length is never negative
[06:02:00] <Cork> < 1 is prob what you want
[06:03:27] <badmaashh> Cork: thanks man i will try
[06:03:48] <sekyms> Cork do you use client side tempting?
[06:03:51] <sekyms> templating
[06:04:08] <Cork> sekyms: normally, no, but i have one site i use it on
[06:04:18] <Cork> jqote2
[06:04:20] <sekyms> are you using handlebars?
[06:04:22] <sekyms> ah
[06:04:26] <sekyms> nm
[06:04:35] <Cork> i liked the syntax and structure for jqote2
[06:04:49] <Cork> good performance combined with flexible and readable templates
[06:05:02] <sekyms> i like handlebars because you can pre-compile
[06:05:10] <Cork> so can jqote2
[06:05:13] <sekyms> nice
[06:05:25] <sekyms> and it uses mustache syntax
[06:05:43] <badmaashh> Cork: i tried == 0 and < 1 both, none of them work
[06:05:44] <Cork> sekyms: http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[06:06:05] <Cork> badmaashh: console.log(jQuery('#banner').length)
[06:06:27] <Cork> i suspect you have the id in the page
[06:08:49] <BillCriswell> Off to work I go. =(
[06:08:57] <Velveeta> i just got to work
[06:09:05] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: This shit os for the birds.
[06:09:10] <Velveeta> lol
[06:09:26] <BillCriswell> Later!
[06:10:54] <Snoopal> hey guys. i got a function binded to a selector like $('#bla').snappscroll(); for easier controll there is a navigation which uses scrollTo to scroll directly to the point. is there a way to unset "snappscroll" while i do scrollTo and then reattach "snappscroll" to the selector?
[06:11:20] <sekyms> Snoopal: unbind?
[06:11:53] <Snoopal> that would be then $('#bla').unbind('snappscroll') ?
[06:12:54] <sekyms> http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[06:12:59] <sekyms> i think you can use off now too
[06:13:07] <sekyms> which is preferred
[06:13:44] <Velveeta> well, bind/unbind are for event bindings
[06:14:30] <Velveeta> when you say 'binded to a selector' i don't think you mean it in the same way that unbind is meant for
[06:14:39] <Velveeta> is that a plugin or a widget, do you know?
[06:15:09] <clime> guys, can I set last option in select like this: $('#select_id option').last().attr('selected', 'selected'); ?
[06:15:14] <Velveeta> if it's a widget, it may have a 'disable' function you can call, then 'enable' it again… if it's a plugin, you may have to search the source code to see if there's an option to temporarily disable it, otherwise you may have to destroy it somehow and reinstantiate it
[06:15:35] <Velveeta> clime: you should use .prop for that instead of .attr, .prop('selected', true);
[06:15:57] <clime> velveetta: ok thx
[06:16:15] <Snoopal> Velveeta: its a plugin
[06:16:32] <Snoopal> oh no :(
[06:16:36] <Velveeta> snoopal: you may need to search its source then
[06:17:20] <Snoopal> :/
[06:17:32] <Velveeta> do you know the url to the version you have?
[06:17:37] <sekyms> Velveeta: any handlebars experience?
[06:17:41] <Velveeta> i can take a quick peek and see if there's anything obvious in there
[06:17:48] <Velveeta> sekyms: plenty, bring it on
[06:18:00] <sekyms> oh thank god
[06:18:09] <sekyms> Velveeta pm or in the room?
[06:18:25] <Velveeta> the room is fine, that way if anyone else is in need of that info, they can benefit also
[06:19:03] <sekyms> https://gist.github.com/smykes/b0c61b755e04ef8561e6
[06:19:25] <jop008> If I do an ajax post of strings how can the srver know if is a string. So must I use '  in my insert statement or not?
[06:19:30] <Snoopal> Velveeta: https://github.com/wtm/jquery.snapscroll/blob/master/core/jquery.snapscroll.js
[06:19:35] <sekyms> my try at the handlebars is the first file Velveeta and the ison file is the second file
[06:19:44] <jop008> The fields are dynamic so you don't know the type before hand
[06:19:47] <Velveeta> whoa what is this.. i thought you meant like handlebars like on a bike.. i used to let people ride on mine to get to the playground when i was younger
[06:19:51] <Velveeta> j/k
[06:19:56] <sekyms> :)
[06:20:11] <Velveeta> jop: insert statement?
[06:20:13] <sekyms> BUT MINE HAD TASSELS
[06:20:30] <Velveeta> sekyms: oh there's the tassel helper, i missed it
[06:20:34] <Velveeta> ok, now i can work with this
[06:21:04] <Velveeta> sekyms: so what's your question about this template?
[06:21:17] <sekyms> I can't get to anything inside of Totals
[06:21:21] <sekyms> it doesn't work
[06:21:32] <Velveeta> ok let me take a closer look
[06:21:55] <sekyms> I would give you access but I would probably be sued and fired ;)
[06:22:25] <Velveeta> it's because your totals object is an array of objects, but you're trying to dereference it like a regular object in your template
[06:22:43] <sekyms> Velveeta: how can I remedy this?
[06:24:20] <Velveeta> you can either create a helper method to let you iterate while injecting an index value of some kind (we have one here called #each_index) and then iterate over Totals with it and create one <td class="center"> and reference the Foo+index field of your item, or, i would probably just change the format of Totals coming from the server
[06:24:37] <Velveeta> you already have unique keys in those objects, there's no need to separate them into separate objects in an array
[06:24:59] <Velveeta> so i would just make Totals: { Foo1: { data }, Foo2: { data }, etc }
[06:25:16] <Velveeta> you'll have the same issue with your SiteTotals property
[06:25:36] <sekyms> yeah i would
[06:26:40] <sekyms> Velveeta: let me try and reformat the json
[06:26:49] <sekyms> and see if i follow what you mean
[06:27:04] <Velveeta> if you're in php, it should be fairly simple
[06:27:17] <sekyms> heh
[06:27:24] <sekyms> NOPE try again ;)
[06:27:30] <Velveeta> c#?
[06:27:32] <Velveeta> java?
[06:27:50] <sekyms> yeah C#
[06:27:54] <sekyms> .net :/
[06:28:06] <Velveeta> then you'll probably have to change your viewmodel types :)
[06:28:30] <Velveeta> is it key/value pair list? if so it only needs to be a key/value pair object
[06:28:35] <sekyms> yes I am not a backend guy so this could be interesting
[06:29:44] <sekyms> I'm having issues understanding how you can take the objects out and still do this Velveeta
[06:29:57] <Velveeta> yeah i'm not either, but my current job is a mostly c#.net shop, so i've picked it up little by little over the past couple years :)
[06:30:05] <sylflo> hi
[06:30:10] <Velveeta> sekyms: you don't take the objects out, you collapse them
[06:30:16] <sekyms> yeah Velveeta i mstarting to
[06:31:02] <Velveeta> instead of being like this: [ { key1: object1 }, { key2: object2 }, { key3: object3 }, etc ], you collapse them into { key1: object1, key2: object2, key3: object3, etc }
[06:31:26] <Velveeta> just like you have your top-level object there, which Totals and SiteTotals are a member property of
[06:32:04] <sekyms> Velveeta ok trying to figure it out lol
[06:32:39] <sylflo> i'm making a website, I have several pages but i'd like to have sliding animation when loading the pages. I saw a lot of tutorial with one page website. But is it possible to do it with a website with differente pages ? Is it Jquery enough to do that or do i need ajax also ?
[06:32:40] <snorti> someone can test something for me on a xp ie8 browser?
[06:34:37] <maitre_kaio> sylflo: something like http://qi2-software.fr
[06:34:40] <maitre_kaio> ?
[06:35:16] <sekyms> Velveeta: can you take a look at this in about 5 minutes?
[06:35:22] <Velveeta> sure
[06:35:42] <sylflo> yes maitre_kaio i'll look a the code thanks :D
[06:36:05] <sylflo> but ajax do i need ajax ?
[06:36:30] <sylflo> I'm asking that because I don't know this language for the moment
[06:37:00] <DRSK> so I'd just like to do some stuff if the window width is > 767pixels, what would be a good way of doing that? Just wrap what I want within an if-statement checking window width?
[06:37:17] <maitre_kaio> sylflo: yes because if the whole page is reloaded, you can't have any transitions
[06:37:40] <maitre_kaio> sylflo: ajax is not a language, but a technique
[06:37:54] <Velveeta> DRSK: yep, though you might also want to bind that function to a window resize event in case the user grows or shrinks their window
[06:38:14] <snorti> someone can test something for me on a xp ie8 browser?
[06:38:33] <sylflo> ok it's just for reloaded, but if you don't want transition during load page it's not necessary ? Ok a technique
[06:39:03] <Velveeta> sylflo: the best you're gonna be able to hope for is to load your page with all of the content positioned off of the window, and slide it in at load time, otherwise you'll see it load and then blink out and slide in… but just for the record, i think this is a horrible idea for a multipage site
[06:39:52] <maitre_kaio> snorti: do you know that you can have a vm for free with xp/ie8 ?
[06:40:11] <snorti> no show me
[06:40:41] <snorti> i know i can use vm's but a xp for free?
[06:41:51] <Velveeta> it's an XP VM, with IE8 installed
[06:42:08] <Velveeta> MS makes a certain set of VM's available for free specifically for testing browser compatibility with various sites
[06:42:15] <sylflo> Velveeta: yeah maybe it's not a good idea for a multipage site but I'm in an internship and they want that. And I don't want to do the site in one page because there is too much contents
[06:43:03] <Velveeta> sylflo: when a person says single-page vs multi-page, they don't mean load the entire content of the whole site when you load the page, it just means that additional pages are loaded in via ajax and the content is replaced with it
[06:43:16] <snorti> Velveeta: link?
[06:43:46] <Velveeta> so you load the page once, get the landing page like normal, but clicking navigation doesn't take you to a different page, it just swaps out the content of the page you're looking at, which is why they're able to have those transition effects, there's no reload, just new content injection
[06:43:52] <Velveeta> snorti: let me see if i can dig it up
[06:44:39] <sylflo> ok so I can do a website with one page and don't be afraid for the loading. It's nice thanks to you, you learned someting very useful :D.
[06:44:40] <maitre_kaio> Velveeta: I just can't find those stupid links again
[06:45:00] <sekyms> sylflo: use backbone or angular
[06:45:01] <Velveeta> snorti: oh, looks like they don't have an XP/IE8 version available, it's XP/IE6, but you can always get it loaded and then upgrade your browser in it: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11575
[06:45:28] <snorti> thx
[06:45:33] <Velveeta> no problemo
[06:45:37] <maitre_kaio> sylfl: I think you didn't understand
[06:46:31] <sekyms> Velveeta: is this what you are proposing?
[06:46:32] <sekyms> http://pastebin.com/HVCZSq0m
[06:47:01] <Velveeta> sekyms: not exactly, but that would work also
[06:47:14] <Velveeta> i'll create a pastebin example of what i was talking about
[06:47:21] <sylflo> ah but when I come to the website I'm loading all the website at once or it's when I swap the content ? At the worst I'm thinking of doing an animation for the loading
[06:48:03] <Velveeta> sylflo: when you load each page is when the new content is requested, it doesn't request everything on the first page load
[06:48:30] <maitre_kaio> sylflo: you load the home page like usual. Then you do ajax requests to load the other pages when the user clicks on a link
[06:48:34] <sekyms> ty so much velveeta
[06:49:53] <sylflo> oki thanks to you Velveeta and maitre_kaio : I'll learn Ajax now.
[06:51:55] <maitre_kaio> sylflo: making  ajax requests with jquery is very easy. Don't be afraid
[06:52:33] <Velveeta> sekyms: http://pastebin.com/NsbsWUGs
[06:52:43] <sylflo> i'm not afraid, I'll like to learn new things so it's cool :D
[06:52:46] <sylflo> *I like
[06:52:59] <Velveeta> the first results item has the Totals array collapsed into a single object definition, the 2nd results item has it in the original format
[06:55:05] <sekyms> yeah thats not valid json
[06:56:00] <sylflo> bye
[06:57:54] <Velveeta> sekyms: whoops, i forgot the commas between the object properties
[06:57:58] <Velveeta> but aside from that it's perfectly valid
[06:58:37] <Velveeta> there, fixed: http://pastebin.com/6NBsiCjY
[07:00:25] <sekyms> so you have an object of objects instead of an array of objects?
[07:01:10] <Velveeta> yep
[07:01:15] <Ziber> Can I use JQuery to interact with (and send data to a PHP script) from within a colorbox if the JS is in my main code and not the href that the colorbox is loaded from?
[07:01:27] <Velveeta> wait, inside an array of objects?
[07:01:39] <Velveeta> i mean, that would be perfectly valid also, but that's not the case here
[07:01:50] <Velveeta> that's simply an object nested inside of another object
[07:02:07] <sekyms> yeah I'm so confused at this point lol, is your helper publicly available?
[07:02:09] <Velveeta> er yeah, i guess it is nested inside of an array of the results object
[07:02:13] <sekyms> is it a part of the assemble helpers?
[07:02:30] <Velveeta> fraid not, it's one we wrote, and my company probably wouldn't be too happy if i gave it out
[07:02:42] <sekyms> yeah understandably
[07:03:10] <Velveeta> so, you can nest any object inside of any other object, even if that object is itself nested inside of an object or inside of an array of objects
[07:03:18] <Velveeta> as long as the properties are unique, that's all that matters
[07:03:48] <Velveeta> it's like at your top level, you have an object with properties PageNo, TotalResults, etc, any of those could hold an object reference if you wanted
[07:04:04] <sekyms> but not multiple
[07:04:11] <Velveeta> you could have { PageNos: { LandingPage: 1, LoginPage: 2, etcPage: 3 } }
[07:04:38] <Velveeta> what you couldn't have would be something like { PageNos: { LandingPage: 1, LandingPage: 2, LandingPage: 3 } because those keys aren't unique
[07:04:51] <sekyms> riht
[07:04:57] <sekyms> let me try one more time
[07:05:15] <Velveeta> similarly, you could have nested arrays: Results: [ [ [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 3] ], 4 ]
[07:06:14] <Velveeta> and you can mix and match them: MyObject: { MyArray: [ { My2ndObject: [] }, [ My3rdObject: { My4thObject: { My5thObject: [] } } } ] }
[07:07:40] <Ziber> I'm having trouble understanding what the selector before a colorbox call represents...
[07:08:30] <sekyms> Velveeta: Im guessing this is the something like what you use?  https://gist.github.com/burin/1048968
[07:09:07] <kristofers> how do you load your sliders ?
[07:09:08] <Velveeta> sekyms: yeah that's pretty close
[07:09:09] <kristofers> i mean on what event
[07:09:41] <Velveeta> sekyms: it's gonna require an additional helper method though, i'm pretty sure
[07:10:01] <Velveeta> i don't know that you can do property concatenation inline in a handlebars template, you have to break that out into a helper function
[07:10:04] <sekyms> ok I'm going to try to use that for now so I don't have to get another dev involved that isn't you ;)
[07:10:18] <Velveeta> so you could say like {{#ConcatPropertyName "Foo" index}}
[07:10:21] <Velveeta> or something
[07:11:40] <rdldew> Good morning.
[07:14:07] <sekyms> Velveeta:
[07:14:08] <sekyms> https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/250#issuecomment-9514811
[07:14:08] <b-ot> sekyms: Issue #250 by rbu (15mon 2w ago): Include index in each block helper, aka each_with_index
[07:15:08] <Velveeta> sekyms: oh neato, i'll have to start using that then
[07:15:28] <sekyms> i think that might be what i need
[07:29:22] <krambiorix> i have a problem: i use $("#mydiv").scrollTop(0);   to scroll the div to top.  It works , but the scrollbar doesn't go up.... What can i do?
[07:34:04] <jop008> It sems when I generate my xlhttp post string that encodeuri generates extra & can this be possible/
[07:36:10] <sunbeam> I've got a site, I click on a link (generate PDF) it generates the PDF but sometimes takes 50 seconds.. when i look in console I see the called ajax script providing the link is loading.. during this loading I'd like some overlay on my site
[07:36:16] <sunbeam> how can I best accomplish this?
[07:40:57] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: When you click it show the loader, when the request is complete hide it.
[07:45:49] <BillCriswell> 6 more days...
[07:50:18] <Velveeta> bill: false, it's actually today
[07:50:25] <Velveeta> you're talking about talk like a pirate day, right?
[07:56:12] <Velveeta> ark, phone screening for the next hour
[07:59:18] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: yes thats what i need
[07:59:40] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: any idea how i can create that?
[08:00:09] <scar> if im sending canvas data thru ajax to PHP, and storing the image, what would cause the image to show up as an invalid image on  the browser URL, but when d/l via ftp the image opens fine?
[08:00:40] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha, till I start a new gig.
[08:05:56] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: any idea?
[08:08:57] <dAnjou> hey, i've this in one of my pages: http://bpaste.net/show/9cxwBi2MnFmDBJemtaQ1/
[08:09:23] <dAnjou> do you have any idea why $(document).on('click', '.open-message-box', function(e) {...}); works while ...
[08:09:46] <dAnjou> $('.open-message-box').on('click', function(e) {...}); does not?
[08:10:44] <dAnjou> usually i do it like the latter and it works fine but this code is from a collegue and it just doesn't work with his code
[08:10:48] <dAnjou> so strange
[08:11:02] <jop008> I have this strang thing here my console output http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-19_at_5.07.55_PM-yygryBKN.png this is the function http://pastebin.com/BPvV5ekE
[08:11:24] <jop008> so who can think of an error or where to look for
[08:13:13] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://jsbin.com/UkOpaXo/1/edit This is basically what I'm thinking.. .spinner would just be the loading element..
[08:13:28] <Bloomberg> Guys!
[08:13:39] <dAnjou> oh, and there is no console output at all
[08:14:03] <Bloomberg> How can I post a php function that generates a report of pdf with " MPDF " from jquery in html
[08:14:04] <Bloomberg> ?
[08:15:25] <BillCriswell> and pretend I put a pdf-generator-trigger class on the link. =)
[08:16:42] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: where is the new job
[08:17:09] <BillCriswell> It's about 4 blocks from this one. I'll have to walk by every day.
[08:17:18] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: thanks!
[08:18:07] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: where can i find class="spinner" ?
[08:18:23] <BillCriswell> You just create it.
[08:18:37] <grafi> BOOM
[08:18:56] <sunbeam> var $spinner = $('.spinner');
[08:18:58] <sunbeam>  this BillCriswell ?
[08:19:19] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i mean where is the CSS for this
[08:19:24] <sekyms> Velveeta: finally got it
[08:20:19] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I didn't build all the CSS
[08:24:38] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i get $spinner is not a functino
[08:24:40] <sunbeam> functin
[08:24:42] <sunbeam> function
[08:29:54] <sunbeam> nvm
[08:30:53] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: It was more pseudo code than the real thing.
[08:41:53] <duderion> hi guys, is it possible to find the path to the root node in a <ul>
[08:42:00] <duderion> starting from a given li
[08:42:26] <PhlowHome> you want to find the ul of a li?
[08:42:39] <duderion> all ul's that lead me to that ul
[08:42:43] <duderion> all ul's that lead me to that li
[08:42:51] <grafi> oô
[08:42:57] <PhlowHome> umm
[08:43:16] <rdldew> Would this do what I think it would (check if the var nodeToClone has the class 'removeDuplicateBtn')?  nodeToClone.has().attr('class','removeDuplicateBtn')
[08:43:30] <PhlowHome> how would an li have multiple ul's?
[08:43:59] <Velveeta> rdldew: nodeToClone.hasClass('removeDuplicateBtn')
[08:44:01] <rdldew> Yeah, duderion, an li really only has one ul
[08:44:04] <duderion> li > ul > li > ul ....
[08:44:13] <duderion> a recursive list
[08:44:19] <rdldew> Thanks Velveeta
[08:44:23] <rdldew> To the rescue again
[08:44:23] <rdldew> lol
[08:44:24] <Velveeta> yeah there could be nested ul's, so you want the top level ul?
[08:44:29] <NoiseEee> duderion: parents() ?
[08:44:31] <Velveeta> rdldew: no problem :)
[08:44:41] <duderion> parents gives me all ul's above the li
[08:44:48] <duderion> not the ul's in the path ;]
[08:45:22] <Velveeta> duderion: you'd probably have to do a recursive function that looks for $(this).closest('ul') and then checks to see if it equals 'this'
[08:46:01] <PhlowHome> all ul's above the li IS the path
[08:46:18] <Velveeta> it won't tell him which one is the topmost though
[08:46:25] <Velveeta> i don't think
[08:46:33] <duderion> tricky ;>
[08:46:39] <Velveeta> it may push them as it finds them, so you might be able to do .parents('ul').last()
[08:46:47] <duderion> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/nmeCt
[08:47:01] <duderion> i started a codepen
[08:47:25] <Velveeta> $('#b3').parents('ul').last().addClass('red');
[08:47:29] <Velveeta> that seems to work
[08:48:04] <Velveeta> now that won't work in the case of the current element *being* the topmost ul, but for any child of it, it'll work fine
[08:49:19] <duderion> hmm
[08:49:28] <X-Tor> Hey! I've been having issues binding the 'scroll' event through a delegate (using .on), am I missing anything?
[08:51:01] <Velveeta> x-tor: scroll doesn't bubble
[08:51:09] <Velveeta> so you can't use a delegated listener
[08:51:25] <grafi> and why would you
[08:51:28] <grafi> oô
[08:51:43] <Velveeta> i could see wanting to if you were gonna have dynamic scrollable areas injected into the page
[08:51:58] <X-Tor> Yep
[08:52:04] <glambert> any reason why I can't do anything within $(function(){}); in a Chrome plugin's popup.html?
[08:52:08] <grafi> never would have though of that ^^
[08:52:08] <Velveeta> but yeah, it doesn't bubble, so you can't do that
[08:52:17] <sekyms> velvet thanks for your help earlier
[08:52:21] <X-Tor> Javascript-based IRC client.
[08:52:28] <Velveeta> sekyms: no problem, did you get it sorted out?
[08:52:40] <sekyms> yeah i just put another each in the template
[08:52:46] <sekyms> and  put some ifs in it
[08:52:46] <Velveeta> glamber: you should be able to, does that function exist in the child window's document?
[08:53:07] <Velveeta> nice
[08:54:52] <glambert> Velveeta, jquery.js is included in the popup.html?
[08:55:12] <Velveeta> but is your document.ready function in popup.html?
[08:55:23] <glambert> yes, sorry
[08:55:24] <Velveeta> or are you trying to use a document.ready function in the parent window, but apply it to the child?
[08:55:30] <Velveeta> ok gotcha, in that case, it should work
[08:59:49] <glambert> Velveeta, that's what I thought
[09:00:02] <glambert> background.html is open and I can't even get anything to console log from there
[09:01:09] <jop008> If I escape my string and store it in DBase how to unescsape it when reading the record?
[09:02:19] <glambert> think Javascript may be broken somewhere for the plugin as I can't even alert(); onClick
[09:02:36] <NoiseEee> jop008: databases should store true representations of data, not any escaped or filtered data.
[09:03:02] <glambert> but if I open popup.html in my browser from disk at file:///dir etc. it works fine
[09:04:13] <jop008> okay so my client code is not working when building up a string
[09:04:33] <jop008> only when I escape my field I got a proper post Ajax string
[09:04:51] <jop008> So in PHP I must unescape it and store it
[09:06:08] <jop008> the problem is the fields are not known so I don't know the type of the field or I must add @#text#@and then the string so the server then knows the type of the field
[09:06:42] <mcnesium> on http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/listviews/#list-icons it says about icons for the listview. but this is a linked list. can i have icons on plain listview, too?
[09:07:39] <mcnesium> i am trying to add data-icon="check" to the li-elements, but even with $('#list').listview('refresh'); the icons do not show up
[09:08:30] <mcnesium> so since all the examples on that page are linked lists, i was wondering if icons in a non-linked list are even supported
[09:09:33] <jop008> rawurldecoded is needed
[09:09:37] <jop008> at server site
[09:30:41] <X-Tor> Is there an event that triggers on an element resize?
[09:33:47] <talntid> X-Tor: http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[09:34:31] <X-Tor> From what I understood it only worked on windows, not elements.
[09:36:39] <X-Tor> I'm trying to keep track of when .clientHeight on a specific element changes.
[09:38:33] <X-Tor> I also only care to know while this element is being scrolled. Which is why I started with the 'scroll' event. The problem is, since 'scroll' is triggered on .scrollTop, I'm missing the case of when the element is scrolled all the way up.
[09:39:03] <X-Tor> on .scrollTop change*
[09:40:13] <X-Tor> 'resize' would work, but I'm pretty sure it only works on windows, not elements.
[09:49:20] <boytoy_> At my YouTube embeds project at http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/86/edit -- at the end of embedly() there's a click function to replace YouTube thumbnails with YouTube videos. But inside embedly({}, done: ...) I've cloned the whole embed for preview. How do I apply the same replace-thumbnail-with-video click function to that one as well?
[09:58:04] <crash1hd> hey all if I have the following <input value="smiths" name="foo"> with no ID tag so this $('#foo') wont work
[10:00:52] <BillCriswell> X-Tor: Yeah, not sure there's a way to do it cross browser easily. You probably just have do do somethingThatMayChangeLayout(); checkIfSizeChanged();
[10:01:15] <BillCriswell> X-Tor: I he
[10:02:15] <BillCriswell> X-Tor: I hear webkit has an animationEnd callback or something like that  which can be used to accomplish it, but that's not ideal since it's webkit only.
[10:03:56] <X-Tor> I foresee two ways which may change the size of my element. One is changing the window's size and the other is an adjacent element growing due to content being added to it.
[10:04:34] <X-Tor> The content is being added by the user, since the element is set to be contenteditable.
[10:05:08] <X-Tor> I guess the question would be, can I somehow detect a resize on a contenteditable element?
[10:05:32] <BillCriswell> X-Tor: You'd probably want to set up like... data-width and data-height on the element and check that against the .height() and .width() when a resize occurs or after the element is done being edited?
[10:07:21] <X-Tor> Hold on, I'll check what exactly can cause my contenteditable element to grow.
[10:14:08] <X-Tor> Well, it seems that I could, perhaps, listen to the 'input' event on the contenteditable tag and record/check against the dimensions of the element (I only care about height, so it would be .clientHeight). When I detect a change, I can trigger a fake .resize() event on the element which would be affected by this size growth.
[10:14:38] <X-Tor> I could then also do the same on the window's 'resize' event.
[10:15:14] <X-Tor> Both of which should cover every possibility for a resize on the element
[10:17:34] <BillCriswell> X-Tor: Sweeeeet.
[10:19:49] <X-Tor> Honestly, it's such a bad solution. I don't understand why they wouldn't give us the ability to listen to a 'resize' event on every element.
[10:30:00] <aksu> http://banaaniliiga.aksunsivut.net my .admin div link doesnt correctly work.. i think h1 is top of it.. how to fix?
[10:33:11] <Ziber> When I use .load() to load an external html document, I lose all of my main document's CSS. How can I correct this?
[10:37:24] <jonkri> What am I doing wrong here: jQuery.map($('input[name=my_inputs]').toArray(), function() { return this.val(); }) ... I get "TypeError: this.val is not a function".
[10:37:44] <BillCriswell> jonkri: this.val() should be $(this).val()
[10:37:54] <ravenzz> this would be the DOM node
[10:37:54] <BillCriswell> I don't think you need the .toArray() either?
[10:38:24] <aksu> css experts? http://banaaniliiga.aksunsivut.net my .admin div link doesnt correctly work.. i think h1 is top of it.. how to fix?
[10:39:08] <ravenzz> BillCriswell yes he does
[10:39:22] <ravenzz> oh no
[10:39:24] <ravenzz> my bad
[10:39:48] <BillCriswell> ravenzz: I'm thinking $('something').map(), not $.map($('something'))... can't really recall either way.
[10:40:36] <jonkri> BillCriswell: Thanks - too much Java today!
[10:41:41] <ravenzz> BillCriswell $('something').map() for sure
[10:42:39] <master> I'm confused as to why this is not working. http://jsfiddle.net/5ugvt/2/
[10:42:53] <jonkri> BillCriswell, ravenzz: With or without .toArray() seems to produce the same result: o.nodeName is undefined, and $(this).val() being undefined.
[10:43:05] <master> I'm trying to add a p element to each h2 element using .each()
[10:43:31] <aro> halp, i am getting 'Expected identifier, string or number' on this piece of code: http://pastie.org/8339510
[10:43:34] <aro> what am i doing wrong?
[10:43:51] <ravenzz> jonkri because this refers to the global object (window)
[10:44:26] <ravenzz> try with $.map($('foo'), function (elem, index) { console.log($(elem).val(); })
[10:44:27] <aro> it *only* happens in IE
[10:44:48] <BillCriswell> aro: You have to quote class.
[10:44:57] <ravenzz> jonkri by the way you don't need a jQuery object in this specific case, you can do elem.value
[10:45:02] <BillCriswell> "class":"is cool" in IE, class:"is cool" is not.
[10:45:16] <aro> doof
[10:45:17] <aro> :)
[10:45:19] <aro> thanks!
[10:46:05] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[10:46:28] <BillCriswell> master: You want to go from <h2>Foo</h2> to <h2><p>Foo</p></h2> ?
[10:49:14] <master> BillCriswell: its working as expected here. http://jsfiddle.net/5ugvt/4/ but this is a simplified example. The symbols( >, V ) are actually arrows to be added to a collapsible div, but for some reason when i run it on document.ready callback, the .each is only hitting my first h2 element and ignoring the rest :!
[10:52:05] <jonkri> ravenzz: Thanks!
[10:53:08] <BillCriswell> master: http://jsfiddle.net/5ugvt/5/ it seems to be working on ready here. Do you have the script in like the middle of your document or somewhere weird?
[10:54:24] <master> BillCriswell: i'm not sure, trying to figure out why.. Its pretty much the exact same code, but here, my arrows are All being added only to the first element. debugging..
[10:54:41] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I am trying to speed up my website and I looking into more aggressively caching resources.  One thing I am seeing though is that I have a request being made for a JS file that is being returned with a '304 not modified' status code.  It is my understanding that a 304 response code means that the client has a fresh version of the resource and that the server doesn't need to send back the requested resource.  In my case
[10:54:41] <louism2wash> the server is still sending back 108kb of data.  Shouldn't the server be sending nothing back?
[10:54:44] <BillCriswell> master: Sounds like bad HTML.
[10:55:45] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: Are you sure it's not from cache?
[10:56:20] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: If it's not from cache, do you have caching turned off in whatever browser you're using?
[10:56:55] <BillCriswell> Chrome has an option: [ ] Disable cache ( while DevTools is open )
[10:58:27] <Ziber> Why, when I .load() an HTML file, does the CSS on my main page disappear?
[10:59:33] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: I guess that could be the case.  Let me make sure that the response I am seeing wasn't served from cache.
[11:04:40] <BillCriswell> Ziber: That's weird. Not sure. Are you loading some CSS that's overriding all that's defined rules?
[11:13:08] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: I am having some issue deciphering exactly what is happening in the background but there are requests in Chrome Tools that explicitly call out that a request was served from cache:  http://imgur.com/fLsvqHu   And others that have took time to receive:  http://imgur.com/PzBXoDl
[11:14:04] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: If I should be looking at something else just let me know.
[11:14:36] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: What kind of respone headers are you getting on those files?
[11:16:53] <crivera> is it possible to apply a context to jquery results?  example.  $(":password").filter(myContext)
[11:18:08] <crivera> basically: given these jquery results, filter by this context
[11:20:05] <shoky> crivera: what's the context?
[11:20:23] <bartmax> hi
[11:20:36] <bartmax> i have a question: $messages.on('change', ':input', function (e) {
[11:20:37] <bartmax>         // how can I know get here which item of $messages was delegated?
[11:20:37] <bartmax>     })
[11:21:09] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: You were right.  After turning off chaching I can see that time it takes goes up significantly.  I guess chrome tools is still tracking the time it takes to pull the asset from cache.
[11:21:16] <bartmax> $messages is a collection. created as $messages = $('.message')
[11:21:28] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: Thanks for the help.
[11:21:35] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: No problem!
[11:21:43] <crivera> shoky: context could be $("form")[0]
[11:22:16] <shoky> bartmax:  this or $(this)  if you want the .message element
[11:22:35] <bartmax> shoky: this returns the input.. not the .message element
[11:22:37] <bartmax> which is a div
[11:22:41] <shoky> crivera:  you want only the password fields that are inside that form, in this example?
[11:22:47] <crivera> yes, shoky
[11:23:04] <shoky> bartmax: oh right my bad
[11:23:14] <bartmax> shoky: it's ok. :D
[11:23:43] <shoky> bartmax: e.currentTarget
[11:23:55] <bartmax> will that work on all browsers?
[11:24:15] <shoky> yes, jquery enhances the event object
[11:24:31] <shoky> er sorry
[11:24:37] <shoky> e.target :P
[11:24:40] <bartmax> currentTarget gets my the select
[11:24:41] <bartmax> ok
[11:24:42] <bartmax> :D
[11:25:09] <bartmax> still it retrieves the select element, not the .message element :(
[11:25:48] <shoky> uhhh
[11:26:31] <shoky> e.delegateTarget i guess?
[11:26:53] <bartmax> i see on the event, there's a delegateTarget
[11:27:15] <bartmax> yup looks like that will do it. so I can rely on that property then ?
[11:27:40] <shoky> yeah
[11:28:48] <crivera> shoky: any updates?
[11:29:09] <crivera> basically, I have these elements and I want to filter out the ones that are children of a specific form
[11:30:02] <crivera> oh, there's .has
[11:31:11] <bartmax> shoky: thank you! working perfectlly.. love ya :D
[11:31:11] <bartmax> jahah
[11:33:57] <Eol_> I need to window.prompt() without window.prompt()'ing.  Anyone know if it's possible?
[11:36:15] <Snoopal> Eol_: what kind of question is supposed to be that?
[11:36:37] <Eol_> I don't know. The kind of question that allows me to use a window.prompt() on a google site.
[11:36:47] <Eol_> It's sanitizing my code and not allowing happy things.
[11:36:53] <Eol_> Apparently, the only library they allow is jquery.
[11:37:53] <Snoopal> in this case you may should look for something like "modal" plugin for jquery
[11:38:23] <Eol_> plugins seem to not work
[11:39:12] <Snoopal> iv never worked with google sites so im sorry that i cant help you :(
[11:41:53] <brettfrable> hey
[11:41:58] <brettfrable> whats wrong with this

[11:41:59] <brettfrable>             setInterval('nextPledge()', 3000);
[11:41:59] <brettfrable>             map.onmouseover = function(){
[11:42:00] <brettfrable>                 clearInterval('nextPledge()')
[11:42:00] <brettfrable>             }
[11:42:01] <brettfrable>         }, 2000);
[11:42:01] <brettfrable>     });
[11:42:15] <talntid> it isn't in a jsfiddle or pastebin, for one.
[11:42:22] <brettfrable> basically trying to pause a function on hover

[11:43:40] <brettfrable> there ya go
[11:43:53] <grafi> you are using setInterval for three
[11:43:55] <grafi> ;)
[11:44:11] <BillCriswell> I need an array of chicken sounds.
[11:44:21] <brettfrable> should i not?
[11:44:28] <grafi> have you tried chickennize.com BillCriswell ?
[11:44:29] <grafi> :D
[11:44:36] <BillCriswell> http://www.backyardchickens.com/t/85028/chicken-sounds second post here might work.
[11:44:39] <grafi> :D
[11:44:43] <BillCriswell> I have not
[11:44:46] <BillCriswell> oh. =(
[11:44:49] <BillCriswell> It doesn't exist.
[11:45:02] <grafi> brettfrable http://wallofscribbles.com/2011/setinterval-the-sneaky-basterd-child-of-javascript/
[11:45:13] <grafi> maybe thats why you havent tried it
[11:45:27] <grafi> we should totally make it though
[11:47:19] <snover> that article is sad.
[11:48:28] <brettfrable> that don't help
[11:49:23] <Mrgoose3> Sup sup, for jquery mobile do you put all the javascript for your pages in application.js or do you make a seperate javascript file for each page?
[11:51:10] <grafi> for clearTimeout to work you have to save the result of setTimeout, I would bet thats the same for setInterval
[11:51:34] <grafi> so var id = setInterval(); and clearInterval(id);
[11:51:50] <grafi> snover whats wrong with the article?
[11:52:09] <snover> where to start
[11:52:21] <grafi> at the beginning
[11:52:23] <grafi> maybe
[11:52:24] <grafi> ...
[11:52:58] <brettfrable> so where would i do that here
[11:53:03] <snover> that’s not how you spell bastard; the author doesn’t understand principles of encapsulation, or strong/weak references, or …so many things.
[11:53:20] <snover> setInterval isn’t a good idea, that much is true
[11:53:44] <manuel_> heya
[11:53:51] <grafi> well thats all I care about ^^ it just was the fist article when googling "Dont use setInterval"
[11:53:52] <grafi> ^^
[11:54:01] <grafi> brettfrable ?
[11:54:44] <manuel_> is there a "simple" way to have the $.ajax methods trigger the browser loading indicator? like a parameter to have it do the json in an iframe?
[11:54:47] <manuel_> or some ready plugin?

[12:09:43] <grafi> brettfrable what is map then?
[12:09:51] <BillCriswell> grafi: I wrote a script to migrate a database, and I wanted to make it a step by step command line dealie for some reason, so a little chicken guides you along the journey
[12:10:01] <BillCriswell> and when errors happen, he makes fun sounds.

[12:11:38] <Croves> Hello guys, I bough a theme from themeforest and I'm having some problems with the JS. In this function, the console.log() does not execute and the form is not submited. Any idea?! http://pastebin.com/8eB7AP3h
[12:14:20] <BillCriswell> Croves: They should not have left that in there.
[12:14:33] <Croves> BillCriswell What do you mean?
[12:14:36] <Croves> left what?
[12:14:48] <BillCriswell> Oh I thought they left the console.log() in there.
[12:14:56] <Croves> No, I put it :P
[12:15:05] <BillCriswell> Croves: Do you have form defined somewhere or did you mean to use 'form' ?
[12:15:12] <Croves> At first, the submitHandler was empty. I've added all that code
[12:15:39] <Croves> BillCriswell Well, the form is the callback from submitHandler
[12:15:44] <Croves> (I guess)
[12:16:10] <Croves> And also, there was a comment there saying to use $(form).submit()
[12:16:14] <grafi> brettfrable http://jsfiddle.net/qHRAX/ look here
[12:16:15] <BillCriswell> I totally missed that.
[12:16:31] <BillCriswell> Croves: Do a log on form and make sure it's what you think it is.
[12:16:45] <grafi> BillCriswell from now on you will be known as chickenator
[12:16:46] <grafi> :D
[12:16:52] <Croves> BillCriswell Well, I did it and it is the right form...
[12:17:09] <Croves> Well, if I do a console.log(form) it will display a string with the form HTML
[12:17:35] <Croves> But if I do console.log($(form)), it will display a object pointing that form
[12:17:44] <BillCriswell> Croves: Hmm..
[12:17:59] <Croves> Maybe some conflict with other plugins?
[12:18:32] <Croves> BillCriswell Well, If I remove the function inside the .submit method, the form is submitted normally
[12:18:37] <Croves> Just checked it
[12:19:29] <BillCriswell> Croves: Having a hard time following.
[12:19:30] <brettfrable> appreciate grafi
[12:19:36] <brettfrable> unfortunately needs to be vanilla js

[12:22:12] <maxmoore14> any JQM people here? question about popups...
[12:22:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have a JSON data file which contains 1 root block, and inside there are several sub blocks... I'm looping now over the root block with $.each - but there is only 1 iteration... is there a way to retrieve the contents on the root block without a loop?
[12:23:36] <maxmoore14> I'm using individual files for each page, but I have certain popups that are used by several pages. Do I have to copy/paste the popup code into each file? Or is there a better way - like using html files for each popup too?

[12:28:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi guys
[12:29:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there anyway, using the .animate event, to change the src attribute of an image (NOTE: i know how to do it using background image BUT I DONT WANT THAT)
[12:35:25] <manuel_> hmm, anybody know of a better way to trigger the browsers busy indicator on ajax requests, except than by pulling an iframe?
[12:38:46] <beachandbytes> why use ajax if you want the browser to be busy
[12:42:09] <manuel_> to make it feel fast
[12:42:19] <manuel_> showing a spinner makes it psychologically feel slow
[12:42:27] <manuel_> if i fake it with showing the normal busy indicators
[12:42:29] <manuel_> it feels fast
[12:42:34] <manuel_> don't ask me why...
[12:42:44] <manuel_> but iframe loading has obvious drawbacks
[12:44:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> manuel_: iframe remember is just doc running inside the current doc....so depending on how code intensive the iframe code is you'll get a proportional loading time
[12:47:51] <manuel_> yeah
[12:47:53] <manuel_> so i have a hack
[12:47:59] <manuel_> i have a php page, that just does
[12:48:05] <manuel_> for (;;) { sleep(10); }
[12:48:12] <manuel_> and i iframe that and on finish remove the iframe
[12:48:15] <manuel_> "elegant", as they say
[12:48:32] <boytoy_> O.o
[12:48:56] <manuel_> i'll just double the amount of apache workers :)
[12:49:19] <manuel_> maybe i should make it a sass startup. busi.ly or something
[12:55:22] <doug65536> manuel_: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/y4ZCb/
[12:57:28] <doug65536> manuel_: if you want to disable input on the page during the "wait" condition, there is a way to handle that too
[12:57:38] <rdldew> I'm struggling figuring out making this into some sort of jQuery. if ( defaultOptions.removeButton is item duplicated ){ is clicked, remove itself }
[12:58:24] <rdldew> I basically have a plugin that I want it to remove the last item duplicated. However, if the item duplicated is itself, remove itself. Or, if the remove button is in the item duplicated, remove the item duplicated.
[12:58:41] <rdldew> Finally, if the button is outside of the item duplicated, just remove the last duplicated item.
[12:59:03] <rdldew> As of now, all the buttons do the same thing; remove the last item duplicated.
[12:59:36] <rdldew> I don't want to have to create multiple, separate IDs, or to even make the user declare separate IDs for the remove buttons.
[13:00:43] <rdldew> http://demo.myradicalsolutions.com/duplicator/
[13:02:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there anyway, using the .animate event, to change the src attribute of an image
[13:09:32] <NoiseEee> Rohan_Bhangui: you would do that either before or after, no?
[13:09:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[13:09:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> what do you mean
[13:09:57] <doug65536> manuel_: shows both non-blocking and blocking wait with visual feedback that all controls are disabled http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/y4ZCb/8/
[13:10:01] <NoiseEee> Rohan_Bhangui: animate is for css.  changing the src of an image is something different.
[13:10:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: okay so is there some way i can have .animate running WHILST having the src value change
[13:11:38] <NoiseEee> you can look into the step function maybe Rohan_Bhangui? http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:12:22] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/89/edit -- I got this click function (bottom) to replace YouTube thumbnails with their corresponding videos. But how do I extend this click function to apply to cloned embeds (any embed with class ".embedly") as well?

[13:17:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: i looked into something like this to have two animations running simultaneously

[13:17:23] <rdldew> :)
[13:17:37] <NoiseEee> Rohan_Bhangui: thats something different

[13:17:42] <Asmooh> anyone still uses a mac in 2013?
[13:17:50] <rdldew> I would hope everyone
[13:17:51] <rdldew> lol
[13:17:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: well its kind of what i was after
[13:18:02] <__equinox> on the html
[13:18:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: i have to change the image and then adjust the margin a bit using .animate
[13:18:13] <__equinox> it won't copy paste the css
[13:18:13] <__equinox> i'd have to find the css for that element
[13:18:15] <__equinox> somewhere else
[13:18:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: anyways, now the image seem to be jumpy when i change them
[13:18:45] <rdldew> What are you trying to do __equinox ?
[13:18:55] <__equinox> I have a bug
[13:19:07] <__equinox> and I am trying to extract out that html and css
[13:19:10] <__equinox> for an element i have
[13:19:12] <__equinox> in my html
[13:19:19] <__equinox> so I don't have to copy and paste the whole html page
[13:19:30] <rdldew> Chrome or Firefox?
[13:20:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> NoiseEee: the code im using is here

[13:21:59] <rdldew> ,
[13:22:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If html is added to a page via an external js with jquery, can this value be retrieved at a later stage?
[13:23:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Because if you look at the source code, the jquery appended html isn't in the source
[13:23:57] <rdldew> It's visible on the page, but you can't see it in the source?
[13:25:06] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: 'source' is the page view at initial load. you'd use your debugger to take a live look at the DOM
[13:25:24] <NoiseEee> so yes, certainly that may be retreived at a later stage
[13:27:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> So an appended value, at a later stage I can do for example $("#someappendedrow").html() ?
[13:30:33] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: sure
[13:33:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok

[14:19:12] <Ziber> I'm sorry if I missed the answer to my question, but I'm having an interesting issue when using .load() for an external HTML document that my main page CSS stops working. Thoughts?
[14:19:29] <goddard> when doing dragglable how can i get the droppable item?
[14:19:32] <nexxy> Ziber, my thought is: needs more information
[14:19:50] <goddard> i know it has two parameters that are passed (event, ui)
[14:19:52] <goddard> anyone know?
[14:20:09] <Ziber> goddard: see the api docs. I think it's something like ui.item.attr('id')?
[14:20:24] <Ziber> nexxy: Sorry, what information am I missing?
[14:20:38] <Ziber> nexxy: Or not clearly enough explaining? :P
[14:20:54] <nexxy> like a code example or something, it would help
[14:22:23] <Ziber> Alright, sure. Sec.
[14:23:04] <goddard> Ziber: ok let me check
[14:26:28] <goddard> Ziber: nah didn't work says item is undefined
[14:28:58] <Ziber> goddard: http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/
[14:29:23] <Ziber> goddard: Click the create link at the top. Enter something and create it.
[14:29:43] <Ziber> The CSS craps itself.
[14:31:23] <Ziber> I know I could just refresh the page and it'd fix itself, but I'm trying to do it without refreshes.
[14:32:58] <Niels__> this works, but it duplicates the first href, i need to get the href closest to the selector, what am i missing? http://paste.laravel.com/SNM
[14:33:17] <goddard> Ziber: i see but isnt that the item itself that is being dragged and not the droppable item

[14:34:23] <Ziber> nexxy: sorry. http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/.
[14:35:02] <Ziber> goddard: do you have an id set on the item you're dragging?

[14:37:35] <Ziber> nexxy: ?
[14:39:21] <goddard> Ziber: no just a class
[14:39:32] <Ziber> goddard: Put IDs. Makes it easier.

[14:45:19] <BillCriswell> Never thought to drag and drop in there.
[14:46:33] <BillCriswell> guy: The & are escaped in b.html.

[14:47:06] <dc_> hi all. help with a question? Should I be able to make a cross domain AJAX POST request with type JSONP if CORS is enabled on that domain i'm posting to?
[14:47:47] <BillCriswell> jsonp is only for getting, don't think you can post with it dc_.
[14:48:20] <BillCriswell> If should be able to use straight up $.post() if CORS is all set up right.
[14:48:21] <guy> BillCriswell: That's not about it. The content loaded is actually correct.
[14:48:54] <guy> In fact, this works
[14:48:54] <guy> http://sinonimai.lt/test/c.html
[14:48:55] <BillCriswell> guy: What if you do something weird to the close script tag, like "<scri" + "pt>";
[14:48:59] <guy> which further confuses me
[14:49:01] <dc_> so POST and JSONP are completely incompatible?
[14:49:05] <doug65536> dc_: what do you mean by CORS is enabled? Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * ?
[14:49:37] <dc_> doug655356 - yep. and nice alias
[14:50:24] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here use backbone?
[14:50:53] <doug65536> dc_: you don't need JSONP in that case - and POST isn't possible on JSONP anyway. use $.post('url...', data..., null, 'json').done(function(data) { ... data is the response ...})
[14:51:38] <BillCriswell> I like when doug65536 confirms things I'm not positive about lol.
[14:51:56] <dc_> hmm, thanks guys. arg - that makes sense. i'll try it out
[14:52:09] <anew> when i return .ajax can i return true and is that a bool
[14:52:35] <LoneSoldier728> for backbone or any other framework, do i just include the model and views as a script src on the html page
[14:52:53] <doug65536> anew: it isn't bool, it is a deferred object. and you can't know immediately whether it worked, ajax is asynchronous
[14:53:46] <doug65536> anew: the first A in the acronym AJAX is "asynchronous"
[14:54:39] <BillCriswell> Later on dudes and ladies.
[14:54:51] <anew> doug65536, i mean when you are success:true
[14:55:05] <anew> is that best practice
[14:55:15] <anew> or success:1 or anything i want
[14:55:24] <doug65536> anew: success takes a callback function
[14:56:15] <doug65536> anew: you very rarely need to use $.ajax directly. I prefer to use something like $.get or $.post and use the returned deferred to handle both success and failure:
[14:56:21] <anew> hmmm
[14:56:25] <anew> i use $.ajax all the time
[14:56:49] <anew> so if i am using $.ajax... success:function(m){}
[14:57:04] <doug65536> anew: $.post('url', data, null, 'json').done(function(data) { ... it succedded, done is the response ...}).fail(function(xhr,status,thrown) { ... it failed, thrown is what shown to user ...});
[14:57:08] <anew> i have to say server side whether it is a success or not
[14:57:17] <anew> ok yeah i dont want to use $.post
[14:57:37] <doug65536> anew: it is identical to ajax. $.ajax is just more typing
[14:57:53] <doug65536> anew: $.post calls $.ajax for you
[14:58:20] <anew> ok thanks for the tip... so on success: server side i have to say whether the ajax call is a success or failure
[14:58:31] <anew> is it best practice to send back 'true' or '1'
[14:58:32] <Ziber> Any theories as to why, when a list is created and processed, the CSS of my main page disappears? http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/
[14:58:34] <doug65536> anew: and I would much rather chain into done and fail than have some deeply nested anonymous functions
[14:58:47] <anew> ok ! thanks !!! can u answer my original question please lol
[14:59:01] <doug65536> anew: I did answer your question
[14:59:25] <doug65536> anew: success: 1    <-- nonsense
[14:59:50] <doug65536> anew: success: function(data) { ... }     <--- makes sense
[15:01:17] <doug65536> anew: <doug65536> anew: success takes a callback function
[15:01:47] <anew> look
[15:01:56] <anew> i send back my ajax with array('success' => true, 'user' => $user)
[15:02:08] <anew> i guess 'success' => 1 makes no sense
[15:02:08] <anew> ok
[15:02:19] <doug65536> anew: you said success: 1
[15:02:25] <doug65536> and were talking about $.ajax
[15:02:25] <aljosa> $('input[name=somename]:checked').map(function(idx, item){ return item.value }) generates "["1", "2", "3", prevObject: jQuery.fn.jQuery.init[3], context: document, jquery: "2.0.3", constructor: function, init: function…]" instead of [1,2,3]
[15:02:30] <aljosa> any idea why?
[15:02:46] <anew> yeah nvmd... i'm asking for someone else who is comfusing the hell out of me
[15:02:49] <doug65536> anew: look up $.ajax and see what success: 1 appears to be saying
[15:02:51] <anew> i know that sounds like bs but it's true lol
[15:02:56] <anew> i got it
[15:03:24] <doug65536> anew: what are you asking then
[15:03:33] <anew> i figured it out
[15:03:37] <shoky> aljosa:  because .map returns a jquery object.  do .get() on it to get an array
[15:03:42] <anew> he's asking me weird questions
[15:03:42] <doug65536> anew: you talk about the return value of ajax, and I tried to explain to you what it is
[15:03:49] <anew> ok ok i got it
[15:03:51] <anew> thanks for the help
[15:03:59] <sahbeewah> he's asking what the server should return as a response to the client
[15:04:06] <anew> ^
[15:04:07] <sahbeewah> there's no best practice afaik
[15:04:14] <anew> sah
[15:04:21] <anew> sahbeewah,
[15:04:22] <anew> what he said
[15:04:25] <doug65536> anew: I would suggest TRUE, and use === true in js
[15:04:26] <anew> shit i'm new to tab complete
[15:04:29] <anew> ok
[15:04:30] <anew> yes
[15:04:32] <anew> that's it lol thanks
[15:05:06] <anew> perfecto
[15:06:23] <doug65536> in the general case I would say never compare to true, instead use not false - but js allows so vague boolean expression that in this case, I would compare to "exactly true"
[15:06:53] <anew> === true
[15:06:54] <anew> right ?
[15:06:58] <doug65536> right
[15:07:38] <Velveeta> yeah, in most cases you can use implicit casting, if there's ever a reason to compare to actual true/false, you should use strict equality
[15:08:02] <tetradon> Hey, so does anyone know if it's possible to declare a JavaScript class inside of the document.ready callback and still be able to access that class?
[15:08:04] <Velveeta> you know what drives me batshit? seeing people reverse their evaluations and write things like: if (true === myCondition)
[15:08:31] <doug65536> tetradon: assign it to window.MyClassName and it will be global
[15:08:35] <Velveeta> tetradon: you can if you expose it somehow, like $(function () { window.myClassName = definition });
[15:08:51] <Velveeta> you n me, doug, you n me <pointing between my eyes and yours>
[15:08:58] <doug65536> LOL
[15:09:15] <doug65536> he got his answer in stereo
[15:10:05] <tetradon> doug65536 Velveeta: Awesome. Thanks.
[15:10:13] <AdamB> tetradon: why bother declaring it in the document ready function?
[15:10:51] <Velveeta> the only reason i can think of is if he wants some kind of dom nodes as references in it, but in that case i'd still declare it outside document.ready and pass those references into the constructor
[15:11:14] <doug65536> AdamB: it could be worthwhile to do that to capture access to some variables local to there, too
[15:11:32] <Velveeta> ah yes, good point
[15:11:56] <tetradon> doug65536: bingo
[15:12:58] <doug65536> Velveeta: you know why people reverse it like that, right?
[15:13:15] <AdamB> why not just use an immediately-invoked anonymous function, and pass in any dependancies?
[15:13:16] <Velveeta> yeah i've heard an explanation "to avoid accidentally overwriting my variable if i put a single equals"
[15:13:41] <Velveeta> my response was just "then don't be a shitty developer and put a single equals"
[15:13:52] <doug65536> Velveeta: 'true' is not an lvalue. true = something  is an error because true isn't an lvalue. I don't do that myself, but I tolerate it :)
[15:14:48] <Ziber> easy way to reload CSS on a page?
[15:15:00] <Velveeta> F5
[15:15:06] <Velveeta> i'm on fire!
[15:16:27] <doug65536> Ziber: wild guess: $('head').append($('<link>').attr('rel', 'stylesheet').attr('src', someUrl))
[15:16:44] <doug65536> Ziber: if you meant programmatically. you might need to remove the old link too
[15:19:01] <doug65536> Ziber: a sloppy way to rip out all stylesheets is $('head link[rel=stylesheet]').remove()
[15:19:29] <doug65536> Ziber: a "clean" way would be to be specific about the src
[15:20:54] <Ziber> doug65536: See, I'm not sure what the best solution to my problem is. If you look at my code, http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/, and you 'create' a list (with the link at the top) and submit it, you'll see that the CSS sorta stops working...
[15:21:42] <d22> hi. when i lounch jquery ui, some of inactive web content is on top of the ui. how can i get rid of that? thanks
[15:21:42] <Ziber> Until you refresh the page, that is.
[15:23:15] <Velveeta> just out of curiosity, why do you need to remove and reread the CSS live?
[15:24:01] <Ziber> As opposed to refreshing the page? Idk... I'd like to?
[15:24:18] <Ziber> It seems cleaner somehow being able to do stuff without refreshing the page.
[15:24:25] <Ziber> Hence like the point of using JS/JQuery.
[15:25:03] <Velveeta> but js modifies the document, which is a living thing that one interacts with
[15:25:16] <Velveeta> the presentation, the CSS, rarely, if ever, changes once it's deployed
[15:25:24] <d22> i mean how can i make jquery ui to stay always on top?
[15:25:58] <Ziber> Velveeta: Except that it like stops working when I do this?
[15:26:37] <Ziber> Velveeta: Do you see the same behavior that I'm describing?
[15:26:38] <Velveeta> once you find the problem though, you'll find that it's a problem with your javascript or your markup, not with the css
[15:27:20] <Ziber> Velveeta: I'm not sure where to begin looking for the root of the problem. That's why I started asking here.
[15:28:24] <Ziber> Any thoughts?
[15:28:38] <Velveeta> you're losing your ui-sortable class on your ul's when you add a new one
[15:29:09] <Ziber> ... Oh?
[15:29:14] <Velveeta> yep
[15:29:22] <Velveeta> open a dom inspector and add a list and watch your ul's
[15:29:30] <d22> hum
[15:29:57] * Ziber blinks
[15:30:59] <Velveeta> ok, headed home, offline for the next hour or so
[15:31:11] <doug65536> Ziber: how do I submit it?
[15:31:28] <Ziber> doug65536: Submit what?
[15:31:37] <Ziber> Click the button...
[15:31:47] <doug65536> Ziber: "and you 'create' a list (with the link at the top) and submit it"
[15:31:52] <doug65536> Ziber: what button? create?
[15:32:03] <Ziber> click the create link.
[15:32:11] <Velveeta> yeah, click the create link at the top first, then enter a name in the modal and click the button
[15:32:15] <Ziber> ^
[15:32:17] <Velveeta> ok i'm out for now
[15:32:28] <doug65536> Velveeta: bye :)
[15:32:34] <Velveeta> :)
[15:32:48] <doug65536> Ziber: you probably have a bad selector that is setting style= across a ton of objects
[15:33:21] <doug65536> Ziber: ah, it's not that. perhaps a bad selector is removing class on every div?
[15:33:31] <doug65536> Ziber: I'll look at code...
[15:33:36] <Ziber> velveeta helped me figure it out.
[15:34:25] <Ziber> If you refresh, it works now.
[15:34:37] <doug65536> Ziber: you have a bug though
[15:34:52] <doug65536> Ziber: every time popupEvents runs, it attaches *another* click handler
[15:35:12] <Ziber> You're right, I should optimize that. how would you suggest?
[15:35:15] <doug65536> Ziber: use $("#newListCreate").off('click').click(function() {
[15:36:09] <Ziber> .off?
[15:36:19] <doug65536> Ziber: it removes handlers
[15:36:28] <Ziber> Oh, okay, sure.
[15:36:30] <doug65536> Ziber: .off('click') removes all click handlers
[15:36:52] <doug65536> Ziber: there is a way to make it more strict, but unnecessary in this case
[15:37:11] <doug65536> Ziber: who else would attach a click handler and not namespace it :)
[15:37:26] <doug65536> i.e. plugins won't
[15:37:48] <Ziber> Ah, okay.
[15:37:52] <doug65536> Ziber: there is also the nuke, .off() that wipes every handler
[15:38:03] <Ziber> updated.
[15:39:47] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[15:39:47] <doug65536> Ziber: colorbox isn't loading
[15:40:05] <doug65536> Ziber: 404 not found
[15:40:21] <Ziber> ol.o
[15:40:23] <Ziber> what/
[15:40:24] <Ziber> *?
[15:40:34] <doug65536> Ziber: GET http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/colorbox/jquery.colorbox-min.js 404 (Not Found)
[15:40:52] <Ziber> Oh, Hm.
[15:40:59] <Ziber> I think I know why.
[15:41:08] <doug65536> Ziber: causes crash when it tries to call .colorbox
[15:41:41] <LoneSoldier728> is using backbone as simple as just including the models, views, and collections on the html page as a js script
[15:41:43] <Ziber> fixed.
[15:41:56] <LoneSoldier728> and im just thinkin it is more complex than that?
[15:44:08] <doug65536> Ziber: if I were you I would wrap that code in an IIFE. you are creating globals for all those functions
[15:44:18] <Ziber> iife?
[15:44:31] <doug65536> Ziber: immediately invoked function expression
[15:44:44] <doug65536> Ziber: (function() { ... code here }())
[15:44:51] <Ziber> What's the benefit of that?
[15:45:14] <doug65536> Ziber: it limits the scope of those functions and variables and prevents them becoming globals (window.updateList, window.popupEvents, etc
[15:45:25] <Ziber> Or, actually, I could do $(document).ready(function() { }); right?
[15:45:32] <doug65536> yes that would do it too
[15:45:36] <Ziber> alright.
[15:46:34] <Ziber> there ya go.
[15:47:01] <doug65536> Ziber: .parent().parent().parent() is probably not a good idea. .closest() is almost always better
[15:47:15] <Ziber> Yeah... that is kinda messy, huh.
[15:47:26] <Ziber> What's .closest() exactly?
[15:47:43] <Ziber> Not that the function it's in does anything currently.
[15:47:45] <doug65536> Ziber: if I did .closest('div') it would go through the parents until it hit a div, and match that
[15:47:57] <doug65536> Ziber: it takes a selector
[15:48:07] <Ziber> Alright. So... hm.
[15:48:27] <Ziber> $(this).closest('ul')?
[15:48:36] <doug65536> Ziber: yes that would work
[15:48:53] * Ziber nods
[15:48:55] <doug65536> Ziber: you know better than I do what parent/parent/parent is trying to accomplish
[15:49:22] <doug65536> Ziber: it makes your js "know" less about the exact html structure, which is goodness
[15:49:35] <Ziber> Yeah, that's true, makes it more fluid/variable.
[15:50:04] <Ziber> That's safe enough as long as it only looks for parents.
[15:57:15] <doug65536> Ziber: for the strictest parent search .closest('.someClass') is a good idea, when possible
[15:57:49] <doug65536> Ziber: note that .closest looks at "itself" before looking through parents
[15:58:09] <doug65536> which is often what you want
[15:58:33] <doug65536> to force not looking at self .parent().closest(selector) overrides that behavior
[15:59:16] <blindMoe_> hey doug65536, ran in to so many issues with that table row sorting script
[15:59:38] <blindMoe_> the script we made worked perfectly but once I put it in the page where it resides all hell broke loose
[15:59:38] <doug65536> blindMoe_: yeah? what happened
[16:00:57] <doug65536> blindMoe_: the one that is strictly per-table didn't work better?
[16:01:02] <blindMoe_> there were so many other js bugs on that page it was ridiculous.. and all the tables were updated via ajax on sort, create, delete ...
[16:01:17] <blindMoe_> doug65536: what we made worked great.. your code and my code was fine :)
[16:01:24] <blindMoe_> it was all the other code it moved in with
[16:01:31] <blindMoe_> it moved in with dirty roomates ;)
[16:01:36] <doug65536> blindMoe_: lol
[16:01:37] <blindMoe_> all is well now though
[16:01:47] * blindMoe_ bought a big broom
[16:03:00] <doug65536> blindMoe_: yeah, I amuse myself by having my debugger active and setting break-on-uncaught-exception, to reveal bad programming when browsing the internet :)
[16:03:25] <blindMoe_> haha yeah I did that for a part of a day and felt very secure in my job in a matter of minutes
[16:03:40] <blindMoe_> so many trailing commas on array items
[16:04:22] <blindMoe_> ok I am outta here..
[16:05:22] <doug65536> 🂡
[16:06:05] <doug65536> can anyone confirm the ace of spades came up?
[16:07:00] <doug65536> if not, shame on your IRC client
[16:07:02] <Ziber> It did.
[16:07:05] <Ziber> utf-8++
[16:07:26] <doug65536> yeah, that's a tough one, it's past 65535
[16:07:40] <Ziber> brb, more food.
[16:09:34] <doug65536> you thought you could escape from graphical smilies in IRC? think again: 😈
[16:10:10] <Ziber>   o                            \O_ Arrgh!!

[16:15:26] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Didn't show up for me. Lime chat... I see the evil smiley though.
[16:16:21] <doug65536> cool. I suppose a font has to be *really* complete for that ace card to come up
[16:16:57] <chilversc> doug65536: not really, it could use a fallback font instead, depending on the client settings and the font used
[16:17:28] <doug65536> I consider it a win if the developer even knows unicode past 65535 even exists
[16:18:09] <chilversc> I like to use musical treble clef for testing, since its outside the BMP plane, so can cause problems with code treating utf-16 as ucs-2
[16:20:12] <snover> consider it a win if a developer knows what unicode is
[16:27:20] <devslash> is IE 10 supported in jquery  ?
[16:27:23] <doug65536> Playing with this code to experiment with generating massive pages without awful slowdown http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/34/
[16:27:34] <doug65536> devslash: yes 1.x supports it for sure
[16:27:36] <tw2113> why wouldn't it be devslash ?
[16:27:51] <devslash> because the same code works in chrome/FF but not IE
[16:28:07] <doug65536> devslash: it's probably your fault. what code?
[16:28:07] <devslash> $('#myselector').css('width','500px')
[16:28:11] <devslash> no
[16:28:32] <doug65536> devslash: what is that element? a div? or what
[16:28:37] <devslash> it just doesnt change the width. no error messages appear in the console
[16:28:47] <devslash> a jquery form element
[16:29:07] <erbalist> hi, i'm trying to $.post a form, but it's not working unless i manually form a datastring with all the inputs inside of the form... any ideas where im going wrong?
[16:29:09] <doug65536> devslash: it is meaningless to set the width of a form. it isn't a displayed thing
[16:29:17] <devslash> what do you mean ?
[16:29:26] <devslash> no not an html form
[16:29:30] <devslash> a view basically
[16:29:44] <doug65536> devslash: ok, what tag is #myselector
[16:29:45] <devslash> i call it a form but its not the type of form that you are thinking of
[16:29:52] <devslash> i dunno what do you mean ?
[16:29:55] <devslash> its an element
[16:30:02] <doug65536> a? div? p?
[16:30:11] <doug65536> span? etc
[16:30:48] <devslash> its a <fieldset
[16:30:59] <devslash> >
[16:32:21] <doug65536> devslash: .css({display: 'block', width: '500px'}) might be more successful
[16:33:25] <devslash> this is console's output
[16:33:25] <devslash> http://pastebin.com/1TyLkq6f
[16:34:02] <devslash> I get the same output if i do it the other way using .css('width','500px')
[16:36:12] <devslash> its ok thanks anyways. im going to just block users from using IE
[16:36:47] <tw2113> given the fact that it's basic css, it should be possible within a modern browser like IE
[16:36:58] <devslash> well it is not working
[16:37:06] <tw2113> then we need to figure out why
[16:37:17] <tw2113> block IE8 and down if you want
[16:37:20] <tw2113> IE10 should be fine
[16:37:32] <devslash> any calll to .css('width') doesnt work and doesnt display an error
[16:38:00] <doug65536> devslash: if (/msie/.test(navigator.userAgent)) { $('body').empty().append('<h1>IE SUCKS!!!</h1>'); throw new Error("Browser sucks"); }
[16:38:29] <devslash> thats actually not much different from what im doing.nearly the same
[16:39:26] <doug65536> devslash: make your live easy: wrap a div around it and set the width of that, if you must
[16:39:30] <doug65536> life*
[16:40:37] <devslash> im going to only support Chrome and FF. Screw IE in the ear
[16:41:34] <doug65536> devslash: you might find it isn't the fieldset or css at all... maybe you have something like a trailing comma or something that is throwing a syntax error
[16:42:04] <doug65536> devslash: or even unbalanced tags. have you w3c validated it?
[16:42:05] <devslash> no
[16:42:15] <devslash> because i wouldve caught it in the developer console
[16:42:32] <devslash> IE wouldve thrown an error. guaranteed
[16:42:42] <tw2113> i guarantee nothing with IE
[16:42:49] <doug65536> devslash: not guaranteed. what about try catch
[16:42:51] <tw2113> other than downloading a different browser or sucking
[16:43:02] <tw2113> and even that first part is iffy in quality of job done
[16:43:15] <snover> did i just time warp back to 2008?
[16:43:25] <tw2113> you did the time warp again snover
[16:43:52] <snover> ok i am glad because otherwise i would have to say everyone in this conversation badmouthing IE is dumb :)
[16:44:03] <doug65536> snover: please try to keep your speed under 300M m/sec. and your mass < infinity. k thanks
[16:44:21] <devslash> IE has not supported web standards very well over the years
[16:44:35] <devslash> makes it a bitch to try and create cross browser compatible sites
[16:44:56] <tw2113> i've heard IE10 is actually pretty decent comparatively
[16:45:04] <tw2113> still not there yet though
[16:45:07] <snover> no, not decent “comparatively”. decent. period.
[16:45:10] <devslash> still a turd
[16:45:21] <snover> you are speaking entirely out of ignorance.
[16:45:33] <devslash> no i am not. im speaking as a developer
[16:45:34] <tw2113> so i didn't compliment IE10 enough? or too much?
[16:46:01] <snover> a developer that has clearly not ever looked at versions of IE since 2009…
[16:46:14] <devslash> who me ?
[16:46:20] <snover> yes, you.
[16:46:22] <tw2113> give names snover we're confused :D
[16:46:26] <devslash> what makes you think I havent looked at IE since 2009
[16:46:59] <snover> “still a turd” “Screw IE in the ear” etc etc
[16:47:40] <devslash> if you say so
[16:47:55] <snover> how I develop for IE9+: step 1. develop an application. step 2. it works.
[16:48:36] <devslash> and have you tested said websites in Chrome and FF ?
[16:48:46] <devslash> or are you only developing for IE
[16:48:58] <snover> big sigh.
[16:49:07] <snover> let me try again.
[16:49:15] <snover> how I develop for IE9+: step 1. develop an application in ANY OTHER BROWSER. step 2. it works.
[16:49:33] <devslash> what do you use ? frontpage ?
[16:49:59] <devslash> or a WYSIWYG application for developing the sites  ?
[16:53:24] <snover> that was fun for a while and then it became not fun.
[16:53:26] <doug65536> can someone try this fiddle and give me roughly what items per second you get http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/34/
[16:53:53] <snover> i get my browser is locked up now items per second
[16:54:10] <snover> hope that helps
[16:54:39] <doug65536> snover: which browser?
[16:54:52] <snover> firefox 24
[16:55:56] <doug65536> snover: works for me in 23 :(
[16:56:21] <snover> consider yielding control back to the browser every one and a while in your massive loop.
[16:56:30] <doug65536> it does, 10ms per loop
[16:57:13] <doug65536> snover: but I have a very fast cpu... which is why I asked for some random people to try it
[16:59:01] <snover> well, i’m on a 2.3GHz Ivy Bridge Core i7, so not exactly slothful…
[16:59:48] <doug65536> snover: did you kill it? or did it become responsive?
[16:59:57] <snover> i killed it
[17:00:40] <doug65536> snover: sorry you're mad. thanks for trying it anyway
[17:00:54] <snover> i am sorry too
[17:06:03] <doug65536> snover: I retried it with firebug active - it kills it (no JIT compilation)
[17:06:29] <snover> i kind of figured that was part of the problem
[17:15:39] <diminoten> is there a jquery snippet I can use to stop a page from scrolling when I hit the enter key?
[17:15:52] <diminoten> this stupid website keeps moving the page around when I hit enter, even in a textarea
[17:17:11] <BillCriswell> I get done so much more outside of the office.
[17:17:16] <BillCriswell> It's actually confusing.
[17:17:39] <doug65536> BillCriswell: of course!
[17:19:14] <BillCriswell> doug65536: I've had this thing at work I've needed to do, spent the last two days on it, barely got thouh 10% of it... easily at 70% now.
[17:19:45] <doug65536> BillCriswell: I'm "bursty" like that too. some days I get epic amounts done, not so much other days
[17:20:20] <BillCriswell> I wish I understood what triggered those bursts.
[17:21:06] <BillCriswell> I think for me it's the lack of people on the phone around me?
[17:24:04] <Velveeta> why do i have neil diamond stuck in my head? #jquery, halp!
[17:24:28] <diminoten> nm re: textarea, they're not actually text areas but iframes
[17:24:45] <diminoten> great lesson in: "Just because you can, doesn't mean you should"
[17:28:55] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha.
[17:30:31] <Velveeta> love brother love say brother love's travelin salvation show! halle! halllle!
[17:30:53] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMToQg0vSds Listening to this right now.
[17:31:21] <Velveeta> can't listen to it right now, watching tv w/ the wife, but i'll save it for later
[17:31:31] <Velveeta> what genre would you categorize that?
[17:31:49] <BillCriswell> No idea. I'm terrible at labeling music haha.
[17:32:03] <Velveeta> then i'm gonna arbitrarily guess gangster rap
[17:34:04] <BillCriswell> Haha. I do miss the good stuff.
[17:34:33] <BillCriswell> It's funny, Noisee actually mentioned Kurt Vile earlier today and he was originally in the band I just linked to. Sucks he's not here right now.
[17:36:31] <boytoy_> I'm trying to make a simple hover-thumbnails-to-change-photo thing similar to say http://losangeles.craigslist.org/sfv/w4m/4076848779.html at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/4NBeQ/7/ -- but right now when I hover it the whole thing disappears. Anybody know why?
[17:38:59] <Velveeta> not without a demo to examine
[17:39:43] <boytoy_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/4NBeQ/7/ :p
[17:40:15] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: $('img', photos).hide(); this line is the issue.
[17:40:45] <boytoy_> cool let me try rub it gently for a while =)
[17:41:18] <Velveeta> that's the exact line, yep
[17:41:53] <boytoy_> i reckon it's also confused by var photos = thumbnail.parent().find('.photos')[0]; somwhow?
[17:41:56] <boytoy_> * somehow
[17:42:14] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: I'd log it and make sure it's what you think it is.
[17:45:38] <boytoy_> hmm.. alert($('img', photos)) says [object Object] and alert(photos) says undefined
[17:45:49] <Velveeta> so, i dug into the stack trace
[17:45:55] <Velveeta> it's not finding 'photos'
[17:46:26] <boytoy_> cool
[17:46:44] <boytoy_> Velveeta: how does one dig into the stack trace anyhow?
[17:47:17] <boytoy_> oh that whole breakpoint thing i think i saw a tutorial on that once
[17:47:19] <Velveeta> thumbnail.parent() == '.thumbnails', thumbnail.parent().find('.photos') == [], because .photos is the previous sibling, not a child
[17:47:59] <boytoy_> hmm okay..
[17:48:50] <Velveeta> so when you pass that for the 2nd parameter, it sees it the same as just a search for $('img'), which finds all images in the document and hides them
[17:49:24] <Velveeta> then it finds $('img:eq(' + thumbnail.index() + ')' and shows it, so you wind up with 1 img shown
[17:49:26] <boytoy_> Velveeta: makes perfect sense.. awesome.. so yeah var photos = thumbnail.sibling().find('.photos')[0]; doesnt seem to do any harm..
[17:49:58] <Velveeta> thumbnail.sibling().find('.photos') wouldn't find it either
[17:50:08] <Velveeta> you want thumbnail.parent().prev()
[17:50:28] <Velveeta> but i find that kind of dom traversal to be very fragile, you'd probably want something more generic
[17:51:16] <boytoy_> ooh marvellous
[17:51:24] <boytoy_> more generic what do you mean?
[17:51:34] <Velveeta> you could do something like thumbnail.closest('.article').find('.photos')
[17:52:11] <Velveeta> something that requires traversal to some parent and then a .find, as opposed to going strictly to the direct parent and the direct previous sibling, that means if you rearrange it even slightly, that path breaks
[17:52:52] <boytoy_> oh right right, i understand
[17:53:18] <boytoy_> yeah that sounds much better
[17:53:42] <boytoy_> guess its kinda hard to tell whether this thing works too considering placekitten gives me the same image..
[17:54:38] <Velveeta> right
[17:54:48] <Velveeta> i can you your thumbnail.index() is throwing the wrong value also
[17:55:29] <MrTrick> Is there a name for the pattern where a function returns a promise that resolves to a value, or the value itself if the promise is already resolved?
[17:56:00] <boytoy_> damn :/
[17:56:56] <boytoy_> Velveeta: might be related to that previous lesson you gave me
[17:56:58] <boytoy_> one sec
[17:58:13] <boytoy_> maybe not: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/4NBeQ/12/
[18:04:47] <Velveeta> you don't want to use thumbnail.index() there, thumbnail is a cached reference from the closure, you want to use $(this) to identify the actual img hovered over
[18:06:28] <boytoy_> Velveeta: oh yes indeed brotherman: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/4NBeQ/14/
[18:07:00] <boytoy_> thank you so much

[18:07:09] <grafi> good job everybody

[18:07:25] <grafi> :P
[18:07:37] <boytoy_> hehe
[18:07:56] <Velveeta> you'll want to look up 'closure' moreso than cached reference, that's just what i called it, not necessarily the correct term
[18:08:08] <grafi> sounds good though
[18:08:08] <grafi> :P
[18:08:29] <grafi> also while you're at it, learn clojure

[18:15:47] <doug65536> grafi: try this (I fixed the behavior with horribly slow javascript, like caused by firebug) http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/38/
[18:16:34] <Velveeta> what is this, i don't even...
[18:17:27] <grafi> try what? not to scream?
[18:17:28] <grafi> :D
[18:17:36] <doug65536> why does webkit use body for scroll and firefox uses html
[18:17:42] <doug65536> which one is "right"
[18:19:17] <doug65536> imho it id nonsense to scroll 'html'
[18:19:19] <doug65536> it
[18:19:21] <grafi> IE10 is right
[18:19:22] <doug65536> \is
[18:19:24] <grafi> :o
[18:19:46] <doug65536> lol
[18:20:13] <Velveeta> i agree, it should be on body
[18:21:03] <grafi> fullbodyscroll
[18:22:21] <doug65536> either that, or jquery's handling of scrollTo / animate(scrolltop...) is flawed, it should detect whether to actually scroll html or body if the incoming element is body
[18:23:01] <Velveeta> right, it detects everything else
[18:25:05] <clime> hey, anybody encountered issue when replaced  dom element (replaced with updated version of the element loaded by ajax) is not rerenderred until you move mouse/scroll/open developer tools, in chrome?
[18:25:23] <Velveeta> yes
[18:25:41] <Velveeta> you can manually trigger $(window).trigger('scroll') to force the redraw
[18:26:12] <clime> Velveeta: is it like known bug?
[18:26:20] <doug65536> clime: you mean, even when not debugging?
[18:27:09] <Velveeta> clime: i don't know how well-known, but i've come across it before and had to research a fi
[18:27:28] <clime> doug65536: ye, it happens even when developer tools are off
[18:29:19] <doug65536> clime: wow, I've never seen that happen, good to know it can happen if/when it does
[18:30:21] <Velveeta> yeah it was driving me crazy trying to figure out how to fix it when it happened to me
[18:30:36] <Velveeta> i was trying things like .innerHTML = .innerHTML, .className = .className, etc
[18:30:45] <Velveeta> even a .detach/.append
[18:31:28] <clime> strange thing that it does not happen on my local version, just on production server xD
[18:32:05] <clime> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/pxDhwVvT   link here leads to the page, try to post a few comments if that happens
[18:34:50] <clime> Velveeta: I suspected that it's because I replace a block that contains the javascript that is replacing the block xD, that's the only thing I could think of but I would expect such a case to be allright.
[18:35:55] <Velveeta> i don't think that would make a difference, i think it's just an occasional browser quirk
[18:36:00] <doug65536> clime: AttributeError at /members/add/31/
[18:36:01] <doug65536> 'User' object has no attribute 'backend'

[18:48:27] <codepython777> My jquery refers to : jquery.js://@ sourceMappingURL=jquery-1.10.2.min.map - ho do i get this file?
[18:49:34] <doug65536> does anyone know what's going on here: http://jsfiddle.net/zalun/FZqZN/   why does it look like C code and what is application/processing (google gives garbage results if you search for that)
[18:50:43] <doug65536> codepython777: that is your debugger trying to get that
[18:51:13] <doug65536> codepython777: the 'map' file (aka source map) lets the debugger undo the minify and give you readable source for it
[18:52:25] <doug65536> codepython777: I wouldn't waste any time trying to get it. if you want readable source, don't use the minified jquery. if you don't care, turn off source maps in your debugger config
[18:52:43] <MrTrick> Anyone here particularly opinionated? I wanted feedback on whether you think this is a good idea or not; http://mindbleach.com/words/self-replacing-promises/
[18:53:55] <doug65536> MrTrick: I don't see a whole lot of point to that (or I'm missing the point). 'when' is useful when you want to run something when multiple promises are done
[18:54:30] <MrTrick> that's true. I'm using $.when() as a shield; "when I've got everything I need to run this next bit of code."
[18:54:48] <doug65536> MrTrick: .done will give you that for a single operation
[18:55:08] <MrTrick> yes, but it needs a real promise.
[18:55:21] <MrTrick> and you can't use promises inside synchronous code.
[18:55:39] <codepython777> doug65536: Thanks
[18:55:49] <codepython777> Is there a reason to do this: background-image: url(data:image/png;base64,iVBOR - instead of using a URL?
[18:56:08] <doug65536> codepython777: they are getting it from local storage
[18:56:14] <doug65536> codepython777: I think
[18:56:16] <codepython777> ??
[18:56:41] <doug65536> codepython777: http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
[18:56:53] <codepython777> how can you get it from localstorage?
[18:56:59] <codepython777> you are just loading it from the network?
[18:57:07] <codepython777> base64 has the data
[18:57:51] <doug65536> codepython777: hard to guess from that little fragment, but it appears to be reusing data from local storage, instead of getting it from network or relying on browser cache
[18:57:58] <Velveeta> but if you're base64 encoding the image data in the css, aren't you still pushing out the entire image worth of data?
[18:58:11] <codepython777> Velveeta: you are
[18:58:28] <doug65536> codepython777: that is a url - but it points into local storage
[18:58:30] <codepython777> And you are expanding the image 25% for free
[18:59:07] <codepython777> http://bpaste.net/show/rsM4XAzIf2D5laCdbfet/ - its not that small
[18:59:13] <doug65536> codepython777: seriously?
[18:59:54] <Velveeta> yeah it's a decent amount of data
[19:00:06] <doug65536> codepython777: local storage is key value pairs. javascript strings are UTF-16. you can't put binary data in a string. people use base64 for it because of that. who cares about 25% of a few KB, you are avoiding I/O
[19:00:31] <codepython777> doug65536: its from http://getbootstrap.com - the background. Perhaps thats easier to decode?
[19:00:39] <Velveeta> here we go: http://css-tricks.com/data-uris/
[19:00:48] <Velveeta> chris coyer says the main reason is to reduce http requests
[19:00:58] <codepython777> ah ok
[19:45:02] <rosco_y> I'm trying to prompt my users with a jQuery Dialog, and use their inputs in PHP.  What am I doing wrong:  http://pastie.org/8340579 ?
[19:47:58] <MACscr> I need some help finishing up a script. http://jsfiddle.net/zm2Gq/2/. I am so stinking close. My problem right now is that when i press 'show my score', it totals things up for both sections. I only want it to process the current section
[19:48:14] <Velveeta> rosco_y: you're using an id attribute where you should be using name
[19:48:29] <Velveeta> that's not to say 'id' is a bad attribute to use there, but you *also* need a name in order for the field to post with the form
[19:48:58] <Velveeta> it's common to have both an id and name field w/ the same name, one to post (name), one to reference more easily w/ javascript (id)
[19:49:44] <rosco_y> Velveeta: Thank you!  So, PHP requires the "name" attribute to be set in the <input> field?
[19:49:55] <MACscr> no, html does
[19:50:25] <rosco_y> MACscr: Velveeta, thank you, I really appreciate your help!
[19:51:08] <Velveeta> rosco_y: not php, http
[19:51:20] <Velveeta> http won't post a form value if it doesn't have a name for the field
[19:51:24] <Velveeta> at least as far as i know
[19:51:29] <MACscr> my bad, you are correct
[19:51:31] <Velveeta> which means php won't receive a form value for it
[19:51:53] <Velveeta> macscr: as for your issue, look at line 24
[19:52:18] <Velveeta> you're grabbing all ".qscore input" items in the document, and processing 'section' that you pass to them
[19:52:45] <Velveeta> btw, you're not using the 'section' parameter that you're passing in
[19:53:13] <MACscr> Velveeta: i understand that, i am just not sure how i should be using it. I think though i actually need to be using it before i call the function
[19:53:15] <Velveeta> what you should probably be doing is something like section.processValues(), and internally, doing a find for the [qid] fields
[19:53:24] <MACscr> right
[19:53:43] <Velveeta> what do you mean 'using it before i call the function' ? your 'section' reference?
[19:53:55] <MACscr> yes, like you mentioned
[19:53:59] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:54:53] <rosco_y> Velveeta, MACscr,  I just added a name attribute, so my input field now reads: <input name="txtURL" id="txtURL" type="text"></input>, I'm getting the same error
[19:55:14] <MACscr> rosco_y: jsfiddle example?
[19:55:19] <Velveeta> also, just for your own knowledge, jquery's attribute selectors are slower than some of the other selectors, for some of your searches for things like [section] and [qid], and there's an actual section element that comes in html5 that you could be using in place of that div section="whatever"
[19:55:42] <Velveeta> rosco_y: do a print_r on your $_POST array and see what it outputs
[19:56:04] <MACscr> var_dump() is my preference
[19:56:20] <Velveeta> macscr: try something like section.find('.qscore input').processValues();
[19:56:30] <rosco_y> Velveeta, MACscr--I'll do one of each :)  Thank you very much
[19:56:35] <Velveeta> and you can remove the section parameter from your processValues function since you're not using it
[19:57:06] <rosco_y> Velveeta: I don't understand your last request
[19:57:16] <MACscr> rosco_y: that was for me
[19:57:39] <Velveeta> yeah i'm double-fisting irc right now
[19:57:48] <shoky> ungh
[19:57:53] <rosco_y> MACscr: :) ty
[19:58:43] <MACscr> sweet, got it working: http://jsfiddle.net/zm2Gq/5/
[19:58:49] <MACscr> thanks Velveeta
[19:58:59] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[20:02:38] <rosco_y> Velveeta, MACscr: here is my $_POST array values:  http://pastie.org/8340613
[20:02:53] <rosco_y> looks pretty empty to me, but I'm really new at this
[20:03:11] <Velveeta> can you put your markup up there too?
[20:03:16] <rosco_y> I have a lot to learn
[20:03:27] <martisj> anyone know how jquery live performs compared to on?
[20:04:15] <rosco_y> Velveeta: is that my markup you are asking for?
[20:05:00] <Velveeta> so live is being deprecated, you should use on instead
[20:05:23] <Velveeta> if you want the same behavior as live, use $(document).on() or $('body').on()
[20:05:42] <Velveeta> as for markup, i'd like to see your actual html
[20:06:26] <rosco_y> Velveeta: paste my web-page source?
[20:06:28] <Velveeta> wb technical_13
[20:06:36] <Velveeta> rosco_y: or at least the form source, yes
[20:06:39] <Technical_13> :)
[20:06:55] <rosco_y> thank you.  I'm hoping itwon't be too messy
[20:07:53] <Velveeta> i can always run it through an online formatter if i have to
[20:09:00] <rosco_y> Velveeta: here it is: http://pastie.org/8340621
[20:09:59] <rosco_y> it's pretty klutzy--I want to figure out the the functionality, and then clean up the interface
[20:10:06] <Velveeta> ok, i see the problem
[20:10:19] <rosco_y> wow, that sounds really sweet
[20:10:43] <Velveeta> your form fields are housed inside that #dialog block, which you're assigning for the content to your dialog widget
[20:11:20] <Velveeta> when that widget loads up, it detaches that chunk from the dom and injects it into its dialog wrapper
[20:11:27] <Velveeta> thereby removing it from the body of your form
[20:11:30] <rosco_y> Velveeta: just about everything you said is out of my pay-grade: what should I be doing?
[20:11:36] <Velveeta> that's why the only field left to submit is your submit button
[20:12:29] <rosco_y> I admit I'm really fond of cutting and pasting when I don't know what I'm doing--which is just about always.
[20:12:45] <Velveeta> so, after your dialog pops up and you enter your form info and close the dialog, do you have to click submit to submit that form?
[20:12:57] <rosco_y> Velveeta: sadly, yes
[20:12:59] <Velveeta> or does it auto submit somewhere that i'm not seeing?
[20:13:24] <Velveeta> ok, so in your dialog close event, you'll want to reinject that data back into your form i guess would be one way of doing this
[20:13:28] <rosco_y> I like the sound of "autosubmit", but I didn't even know it exists
[20:13:56] <Velveeta> well, when i say auto submit, i mean programmatically submit, you'd have to trigger it manually, but via javascript as opposed to an actual click
[20:14:14] <rosco_y> Velveeta: would this normally be in a "hidden" field?  (I don't actually know what they are either)
[20:15:21] <Velveeta> you can try adding a 'close' option to your dialog options
[20:15:39] <rosco_y> Ideally, I want to present the user with a link, which opens my dialog, and when the dialog is closed, the values would be sent to the server and PHP would see them
[20:15:51] <Velveeta> and make it something like this: close: function () { $('#dialog').appendTo('#form_orders'); }
[20:15:58] <rosco_y> I think that would be a fairly clean interface
[20:16:23] <Velveeta> well then you'll want to make #form_orders be your dialog instead of #dialog
[20:16:38] <rosco_y> :) sweet, I'll try the .appendTo code you recommend!
[20:16:40] <Velveeta> that way the whole form is loaded into the dialog, and on close, you can just do a form.submit()
[20:16:45] <rosco_y> thank you!
[20:16:47] <Velveeta> but you can start with that snippet
[20:25:48] <doug65536> can someone test this for me and tell me approx items per second (I fixed hang if you have firebug) http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rewLG/
[20:29:47] <Velveeta> 957.01
[20:29:52] <Velveeta> 370.44
[20:30:07] <Velveeta> 281.26
[20:30:25] <Velveeta> whoa, now it just skyrocketed to like 8000, and then 6866
[20:30:34] <Velveeta> annnnnd it's back down to 370 :D
[20:30:46] <Stephen> between 3500 - 14000
[20:30:53] <Stephen> Chrome
[20:31:03] <Velveeta> 3600, 1600, 1400, 6100, and it seems to have leveled out around 5500-6000
[20:31:10] <Stephen> Seems to settle around 12K
[20:31:10] <doug65536> thanks - yeah I think the font cache does some weird stuff
[20:31:11] <Velveeta> yeah, chrome here also
[20:31:26] <doug65536> thanks guys! I get 14731 average chrome/linux
[20:31:39] <Velveeta> well shit, now i feel like i have the slow computer
[20:31:49] <doug65536> na
[20:31:54] <Velveeta> although i have like 20 applications loaded and 30 tabs in my browser
[20:32:06] <doug65536> I blew a ridiculous amount of $ on my comp. you're smarter :)
[20:32:16] <Velveeta> and i'm also running windows 95, maybe that's it
[20:32:21] <Stephen> Firefox: 3K to 7K, hovers around 4.5K
[20:32:33] <Stephen> Windows 7
[20:32:35] <Velveeta> nah, i'm on a company mac, i'd never buy this thing :D
[20:32:38] <doug65536> awesome, as long as its thousands per sec
[20:32:50] <Velveeta> 16 gigs of ram on it though, i'd expect it to be able to run a lot of shit at once
[20:38:32] <doug65536> mines a core I7 extreme with gtx 580 and lightweight mate desktop in linux - I expect it to be really fast
[20:38:43] <Velveeta> nice
[20:47:34] <doug65536> Velveeta: you're joking right? (95)
[20:49:29] <Velveeta> yeah i'm joking :D i'm on osx 10.8 :D
[20:49:35] <doug65536> Velveeta: yeah that awful speed must be it thrashing the font cache - once it has gone through it a bit that extreme slowness seems to stop
[20:49:57] <doug65536> it puts EVERY unicode character there is on the page :)
[20:50:06] <doug65536> all the way up to 0x110000
[20:50:10] <Velveeta> yowza
[20:50:13] <doug65536> skips the surrogate pair range
[20:50:49] <doug65536> (0xD800-0xDFFF aren't characters, they are reserved for escaping values > 0xFFFF in UTF-16)
[20:52:10] <doug65536> I was considering wrapping this up in a "background operation" utility function. it currently caps execution to about 50% of time
[20:52:57] <doug65536> meaning - if it took 20ms to produce a block of 1024 characters, it uses 20ms delay for setTimeout - basically using half of cpu time
[20:53:20] <doug65536> of course, in reality it may do something slightly different - I *ask* for 50% of cpu anyway :)
[20:53:50] <doug65536> profiler says almost all cpu time is in autoscroll
[20:54:16] <doug65536> i.e. the scrollTop call
[20:54:38] <MACscr> anyone worked with collapse() much? Id like to have a button that pretty much closes the existing "panel" and then opens the next http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/
[20:55:59] <doug65536> MACscr: it works by adding/removing collapse css class
[20:56:14] <MACscr> hmm, i think i got an idea, let me try something real quick
[20:56:25] <doug65536> MACscr: I'll give it a try
[20:57:36] <MACscr> well this at least opens the next one http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/1/
[20:57:45] <MACscr> but doesnt close the existing one
[21:00:48] <doug65536> MACscr: almost http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Pr7mQ/2/
[21:02:39] <doug65536> MACscr: works: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Pr7mQ/3/
[21:02:57] <doug65536> MACscr: hmm, once
[21:04:40] <MACscr> nice work
[21:04:43] <doug65536> MACscr: closer
[21:04:44] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Pr7mQ/4/
[21:04:54] <doug65536> still not 100% though
[21:05:00] <MACscr> how so?
[21:05:13] <doug65536> it stops working after you've gone through it once
[21:06:05] <doug65536> MACscr: yeah, hacking classes is probably bad - I'll figure out a proper API way
[21:06:34] <MACscr> doug65536: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-examples
[21:06:38] <MACscr> has some info there
[21:06:47] <MACscr> thats the example im working off of
[21:07:15] <doug65536> MACscr: is this bs 2.x or 3?
[21:07:57] <doug65536> nvm ext rsrc = 3
[21:10:28] <Velveeta> i'm out for tonight, adios
[21:10:55] <MACscr> doug65536: i added a show all button for easier testing and its on real page anyway http://jsfiddle.net/Pr7mQ/7/
[21:18:38] <doug65536> MACscr: got it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Pr7mQ/14/
[21:19:17] <MACscr> nice. thanks so much? Can i buy you a beer?
[21:19:29] <doug65536> sure :)
[21:19:31] <MACscr> lol, no idea why i had a question mark there
[21:19:49] <MACscr> pm me your paypal address
[21:22:28] <MACscr> sent. Thanks again!
[21:22:47] <beachandbytes> don't see that often
[21:23:07] <MACscr> i do it probably a half dozen times a year
[21:23:08] <Stephen> I hate Freelancer.com right now
[21:23:21] <MACscr> when people really go out of there way to help in a really detailed way
[21:23:32] <Stephen> Because their withdrawl minimum is $30 and I just got paid a $25 job
[21:23:40] <MACscr> ha
[21:23:50] <MACscr> that stinks
[21:24:01] <Stephen> Anyone care to award me a small job and have their money paypaled back to them?
[21:24:51] <Stephen> Yeah, not even sure if anyone uses that service in the US anymore
[21:29:18] <doug65536> paypal takes forever to transfer between bank and paypal but other than that they seem pretty good
[21:29:36] <doug65536> forever = 7 to 10 days
[21:29:50] <martisj> Velveeta: thanks for the suggestion regarding on.
[21:30:27] <martisj> I saw a jsperf on live and on()  on was umpteen times better
[21:30:53] <Velveeta> no problem, and now i'm back outta here, was just checking weather and some Skype msg's :)
[21:31:08] <doug65536> martisj: live is gone now (with recent jq version)
[21:31:49] <doug65536> martisj: although, you can approximate it with .on with a selector parameter
[21:31:59] <martisj> doug65536: yeah i see.
[21:32:17] <martisj> i'm a bit confused as to which parent I should attach the on listener to
[21:32:42] <doug65536> martisj: as long as it is a parent of the things that you are trying to catch events for, it's fine
[21:33:16] <doug65536> martisj: even all the way up at $('body') works if it could be anywhere
[21:41:09] <martisj> doug65536: it's generally inside a class selector ('.sidebar_content').
[21:41:46] <doug65536> martisj: ok, then do $('.sidebar_content').on(...
[21:41:59] <martisj> doug65536: cool i'll tryi t
[21:42:10] <doug65536> any matching event matching the selector in the 2nd parameter will fire the callback
[21:42:11] <martisj> i just found some issues with some other part of the script.
[21:42:18] <martisj> doug65536: awesome
[21:42:27] <martisj> that was my understanding of on()
[21:45:44] <Stephen> Is there a limit to Deferred depth?
[21:46:36] <Stephen> doug65536: I have a paypal ATM card
[21:46:44] <Stephen> No need for transfers that way :-)
[21:47:45] <doug65536> Stephen: when I lived in the USA, I couldn't believe how no-tech banks were run. I expected to see a trough outside so horses can drink
[21:48:17] <doug65536> in 2012 they wanted me to write out a paper deposit slip. wtf ??
[21:48:20] <martisj> Is there a difference between single and double quotes/
[21:48:29] <doug65536> martisj: no
[21:48:43] <martisj> doug65536: nice
[21:48:44] <martisj> thanks
[21:48:48] <martisj> good to keep in mind
[21:49:32] <doug65536> martisj: actually, I lied, the difference is 5 :P " = 39, ' = 34
[21:49:45] <martisj> doug65536: hahaha
[21:49:51] <martisj> nerdiebird
[21:50:03] <Stephen> doug65536: It's because many older banks, even though they have electronic transaction logs, have to keep paper legally due to state or federal law
[21:50:28] <Stephen> Not specifically stating they have to have paper, it has more to do with the validity of the record itself in court
[21:51:02] <Stephen> In the end, it's a bunch of pretention though
[21:51:43] <doug65536> yeah, I figured there had to be some reason, but coming from canada it seemed like our banks have warp drive and USA banks are using horse drawn carriages :)
[21:51:52] <Stephen> They use the excuse that they keep extensive hard copy records to make their shady electronic transaction practices seem more honest
[21:52:20] <Stephen> In the last couple years we got smart phone check cashing. I feel that's pretty awesome
[21:52:36] <doug65536> yeah
[21:52:48] <Stephen> Depositing an ATM seems like it should be perfect by now
[21:53:13] <Stephen> But when you have the most counterfeited currency in the world, the system becomes less viable
[21:54:10] <Stephen> Hmm... just though about that last one. I'm betting if one were to look at the statistics on Currency counterfeiting and weigh them against bank advancement, they'd correlate
[21:55:04] <doug65536> one thing that I always found odd about american money: there's nothing to help disabled people. in canada, they emboss braille so even blind people can tell the bills apart
[21:55:29] <Stephen> Yeah, blind Americans have a system of folding they use
[21:56:03] <Stephen> As for coins, it's fairly obvious though
[21:56:16] <Stephen> If size isnt enough, the edges do it
[21:57:34] <snover> twss
[21:58:15] <doug65536> lol
[21:59:47] <Stephen> Interesting
[22:00:02] <Stephen> It appears that, by law, the government is not allowed to redesign the $1 bill
[22:00:26] <Stephen> All higher notes are fine (And have been redesigned 4-5 times in the last 10 years)
[22:02:24] <Stephen> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Note
[22:03:01] <Stephen> I'll add my last comment that I love $2, and ask for them as often as I can
[22:04:30] <raj> I have a function called `myfunc`. I want this function to `return` retrieved ajax `data`. For example--> `function myfunc() { $.ajax({'url': '/somewhere'}).done(function(data) { return data })` ... but this doesn't work obviously. What would be the correct way to do this?
[22:05:12] <doug65536> raj: the correct way would be to pass a function to that function and have it call back when the response is received
[22:05:34] <doug65536> raj: OR, return the return value of $.post/get/ajax/etc and then the caller can use .done on it
[22:06:31] <doug65536> raj: depends on whether you want to abstract out the content of the response, or the caller can "handle" the actual ajax response
[22:08:48] <Stephen> raj:  Here's a good way to handle it: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[22:10:00] <doug65536> raj: here's an approach I use sometimes http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gsvA6/1/
[22:10:39] <doug65536> raj oops http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gsvA6/2/
[22:11:52] <Stephen> raj: There's no nice way of making it synchronous though. Either you rely on a callback or evented model, or use a timer/other polling to check it if it's been resolved
[22:11:52] <doug65536> raj: if your caller can deal with the raw ajax response, chaining or when is good too
[22:12:32] <doug65536> yes, synchronous is total utter crap. never make ajax synchronous. then it is sjax, which sounds awful
[22:12:59] <doug65536> and hangs the browser, and makes your web app look like a piece of crap
[22:13:29] <raj> hmm
[22:13:32] <doug65536> in a programming language with closures, there's no excuse for not being asynchronous
[22:16:52] <doug65536> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gsvA6/3/
[22:17:27] <doug65536> raj: if you ever need to get several things, $.when is amazing with 2nd technique
[22:18:33] <doug65536> raj: see last bit of code http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gsvA6/4/
[22:19:00] <martisj> is there a program that can diff javascript files with syntax highlighting for mac ?
[22:21:14] <raj> doug65536, $.post returns the `data`?
[22:21:25] <doug65536> raj: no
[22:21:44] <doug65536> raj: it is asynchronous. how would that be possible
[22:21:53] <doug65536> raj: it returns a Deferred
[22:23:20] <doug65536> raj: try to think asynchronously. do this, then when that result comes back, do this, etc
[22:23:39] <doug65536> raj: you can't make async any easier than js and jquery
[22:24:33] <doug65536> raj: whatever your caller wanted to do with that instant return value, instead, move that code into a callback
[22:25:07] <doug65536> raj: with closures, it has access to the same variables it would have had access to anyway - even when called way later
[22:26:13] <doug65536> raj: just imagine how bad web apps would suck if they froze at every ajax call. there would be NO web apps
[22:26:29] <Ziber> And life would suck without web apps.
[22:27:21] <doug65536> if it were reversed, you might be here trying to find out a way to fix how it freezes at every $.ajax call :)
[22:27:36] <guspollos> anyone konws a good theme for displaying rankings?
[22:29:00] <Stephen> Eye of the tiger
[22:29:05] <Stephen> gets 'em every time
[22:33:07] <raj> doug65536, cuz you returned it here http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gsvA6/3/
[22:33:59] <doug65536> raj: yes I returned the deferred. look what the caller does with the return value
[22:35:06] <raj> doug65536, oh I see
[22:35:08] <raj> very clever
[22:35:17] <raj> I really wish there was a cleaner way to write this though
[22:35:22] <raj> a paradigm I can follow over and over
[22:35:52] <raj> cuz otherwise there's no consistency in the way I handle the retrieval of my data from the server
[22:36:27] <doug65536> raj: my 1st example shows how you can parse the response and call the passed callback with appropriate parameters
[22:36:53] <doug65536> raj: the 3rd example shows how you can use the 2nd example and do something when multiple responses are all received
[22:38:08] <doug65536> raj: if your ajax responses are hard to work with or you want to abstract them away, the 1st example is a decent approach
[22:38:50] <doug65536> raj: instead of passing the whole "customer record" like that, it could pass any number of parameters, or a custom-built object instead of 'record'
[22:40:31] <doug65536> raj: it works for me. I generally have a bottom layer that accesses the database (and unit test that), then an ajax layer that uses the bottom layer to abstract away the database, then in js I have an ajax layer that generally uses the approach I showed in example 1, then the UI uses that to abstract the ajax calls
[22:41:10] <doug65536> then you can unit test the js ajax layer too, with QUnit or something
[22:41:19] <doug65536> makes it very testable
[22:41:47] <raj> i'm a bad boy
[22:41:50] <raj> I never run tests
[22:41:59] <raj> I live by my debugger
[22:42:03] <doug65536> your loss
[22:42:05] <beachandbytes> ya
[22:42:07] <raj> I know
[22:42:11] <beachandbytes> testing is awesome
[22:42:38] <beachandbytes> not really while coding but when you go to make a change 6 months later
[22:42:53] <doug65536> raj: you would never believe how often tests will fail with stuff that you think works. I've never written a whole bunch of tests and has them all just pass. there's always something
[22:43:02] <raj> I've had to make changes 36 months later
[22:43:37] <doug65536> raj: and yes, the *real* benefit is freedom from fear - no fear to touch anything and wonder what it broke, you run tests, find breakage, fix that, and it is *really* done
[22:44:27] <raj> why can't I just call every one of my functions with necessary parameters and write what I expect as returned output?
[22:44:44] <doug65536> raj: you can. you just described a unit test :)
[22:44:45] <raj> why do I need another library for the testing?
[22:44:56] <doug65536> raj: because the library makes it quicker and easier
[22:45:01] <raj> also, how would I test functions that don't return anything
[22:45:06] <beachandbytes> and allows you to see breakages live as you code
[22:45:44] <doug65536> raj: you can unit test the obvious - and structure your code so it can be tested...
[22:46:08] <raj> but some functions just make DOM changes
[22:46:15] <doug65536> raj: if you want to go hardcore with unit testing, you can use mocks and *really* unit test. but that is beyond basic testing. at least do basic testing
[22:46:17] <raj> oh, so I test to see that those changes were done
[22:46:50] <raj> the other thing is, I delete functions and abstract shit all the time
[22:46:53] <beachandbytes> I feel like mocks are fairly basic unit testing with the frameworks now adays
[22:47:02] <raj> and change functions to do completely different things
[22:47:10] <doug65536> raj: a "mock" is a stand-in for something real. for example, it could take the place of a real database connection
[22:47:23] <raj> doug65536, I understand
[22:47:29] <doug65536> raj: after you can ask the mock if the code really did such and such query
[22:47:37] <raj> ohh
[22:47:42] <raj> interesting
[22:47:44] <beachandbytes> raj, you should move away from that style
[22:47:51] <beachandbytes> testing will move you towards a testable style of code
[22:48:22] <beachandbytes> code that is not testable is not good code usually.
[22:48:36] <raj> ya, the better I've become at coding, the more I have more meaningful and organized functions
[22:49:07] <raj> and the stuff I write now can be testable
[22:50:01] <doug65536> raj: mocks are also useful for forcing failures. you can tell the mock "simulate disk error", plug that in (instead of a real implementation), then do somethign and make sure that the disk error is handled correctly
[22:50:29] <raj> anyway, I've taken this code apart lately to fix some url pushing stuff
[22:51:03] <raj> after this, maybe I can start looking through the testing library and walking through all my code and creating tests
[22:51:19] <raj> wow
[22:51:21] <raj> very nice doug65536
[22:51:27] <raj> what library do you prefer?
[22:51:38] <doug65536> raj: if you want a really easy start, QUnit can be learned in no time
[22:52:01] <raj> I'd rather use the most mature
[22:52:12] <raj> so I can learn it and stick to it
[22:52:26] <raj> without having to have additional testing libraries later to do additional stuff
[22:52:33] <doug65536> raj: everything you learn in QUnit will translate directly into any other testing framework
[22:52:57] <raj> k
[22:53:04] <raj> thank you
[22:53:11] <doug65536> raj: testing frameworks consist mostly of a "test runner" (way to plug in test items), and things that check that things are what they are supposed to be (assertions)
[22:55:25] <raj> doug65536, got a general flow question for you
[22:59:12] <doug65536> raj: one last tip about unit testing ajax... be mean, do evil things, do bad requests, send requests that omit important data, make sure your server side deals with it correctly (make sure it returns a server error)
[23:00:33] <raj> yes, my code in general needs to be walked through function by function server side and client side
[23:01:16] <raj> I'm sure some of the code I wrote 3yrs ago would make me throw up today
[23:01:33] <raj> in fact, the stuff I'm working on now makes me nauseated
[23:01:39] <doug65536> lol
[23:01:57] <Ziber> So, let's talk code. Why, when I .load() a page, does the JQuery not work on it?
[23:02:12] <raj> Ziber, what's that mean?
[23:02:21] <raj> it does work
[23:02:30] <doug65536> Ziber: is that stuff on the same domain as the page?
[23:02:40] <Ziber> Well. I load an HTML file, I want to interact with elements I load, none of them work.
[23:02:43] <Ziber> Yes.
[23:02:48] <raj> Ziber, strip it
[23:02:50] <Ziber> same directory, in fact.
[23:02:51] <Ziber> ?
[23:03:14] <doug65536> Ziber: are you specifying a selector to extract the part you want at the end of the url?
[23:03:14] <raj> $.trim
[23:03:46] <Ziber> what's $.trim do? and no, it's a pretty basic file.
[23:04:11] <raj> Ziber, making something into a jquery object doesn't work as expected when there's whitespcae
[23:04:13] <doug65536> Ziber: you rarely want "the whole page", you typically extract out some subset of it
[23:04:38] <Ziber> doug65536: Hard to explain, but I'm confident I do, in fact, want the whole page. It's just an HTML fragment.
[23:05:33] <doug65536> Ziber: can you show the page? PM me if you are uneasy. I'll see if I can deduce what's going on in the debugger
[23:05:41] <Cork> raj: that is fixed in the newest jquery
[23:05:48] <Cork> 1.10 should not have that problem
[23:05:54] <Ziber> Sure, sec.
[23:06:13] <raj> ah ok, thanks Cork
[23:06:39] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know this answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18909894/what-am-i-doing-wrong-for-this-setup-backbone-js
[23:08:18] <Ziber> doug65536: http://sandbox.jkode.us/drag/
[23:11:00] <doug65536> Ziber: your problem is, those elements don't exist yet, therefore no click handler ever gets attached to them
[23:11:10] <doug65536> Ziber: you need to use event delegation to make that work as you expect
[23:11:51] <Ziber> If I take everything inside $(document).ready(), put it in it's own function, call that on .ready and call it again when it's reloaded?
[23:11:53] <doug65536> Ziber: when this "$("li span.left").click(function() {" executes, those newly loaded things don't exist
[23:11:59] <doug65536> Ziber: no
[23:12:15] <doug65536> Ziber: 1 sec
[23:12:20] <Ziber> Okay.
[23:13:00] <doug65536> Ziber: does #table_container always exist and it is parent of where you .load stuff?
[23:13:10] <Ziber> uh...
[23:13:12] * Ziber looks
[23:13:12] <doug65536> oops tableContainer
[23:13:22] <Ziber> Yeah
[23:13:25] <Ziber> It does always exist.
[23:13:57] <doug65536> Ziber: at line 49, change it to $('#tableContainer').on('click', 'li span.left', function() { ...
[23:14:15] <Ziber> Why?
[23:14:29] <doug65536> Ziber: because that will catch events from stuff you create later
[23:14:42] <Ziber> That's not the only event that doesn't work when it's reloaded, btw. Can I do that in sortable, too?
[23:14:45] <doug65536> that don't exist *yet* when it hits that line of code
[23:14:52] <Ziber> Alright, I see.
[23:15:34] <doug65536> Ziber: bug is, + doesn't work. right?
[23:15:34] <Ziber> Ah, there we go.
[23:16:33] <Ziber> :)
[23:16:46] <Ziber> Still can't sort them.
[23:16:51] <Ziber> I wonder if I can see why.
[23:17:26] <Ericx2x> in jquery how can i check to see if a php element is a certain number?
[23:17:40] <Ericx2x> for instance something like this if($phpvariable === 1){
[23:17:52] <Ericx2x> but i know that doens't make sense
[23:18:21] <doug65536> Ericx2x: one hack is to do this:  <script>var someNumber = <?php echo $phpvariable; ?>;</script>
[23:18:22] <Cork> Ericx2x: client side can't access variables that exist server side
[23:18:40] <poutine> doug65536, eh I think you'd want to json_encode it to ensure proper quoting
[23:18:54] <Cork> ya
[23:19:03] <doug65536> poutine: yeah, was just to give him the gist of it
[23:19:12] <Cork> also note this means the user can access this data
[23:19:41] <Ziber> I think I understand.
[23:21:17] <doug65536> Ziber: what do you mean, sorting. I can drag stuff around
[23:22:37] <Ziber> Items, too?
[23:22:39] <Ziber> :)
[23:22:50] <Ziber> After you've added a new one, that is.
[23:22:51] <doug65536> Ziber: not items
[23:23:07] <doug65536> Ziber: what you can do is pass a callback as the 2nd parameter to load, and setup your drag and drop there
[23:23:45] <doug65536> .load
[23:23:45] <b-ot> doug65536: like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[23:24:22] <doug65536> wow, b-ot was right on the ball there :)
[23:25:51] <Ziber> Pass a callback... hm. Okay.
[23:28:00] <Ziber> Success.
[23:28:01] <Ziber> :D
[23:28:57] <Ziber> Lol. We're really populating that list.
[23:29:31] <sylflo> hello
[23:46:16] <_pingu> given is a script which does 8 search and replaces per regex over a large string.  one after the other. some of them do complex things, like replace with groups. it's to slow. how can i increase it's speed?
[23:47:02] <Cork> _pingu: you can use split and none regex search in loops
[23:47:25] <Cork> _pingu: regex becomes slow if you start to use look ahead or look behind a lot
[23:49:06] <doug65536> _pingu: hard to say without seeing the regex and the text it is matching against
[23:49:52] <doug65536> _pingu: making it too general can slow it down, being a bit more specific can immensely increase performance
[23:51:15] <_pingu> one moment
[23:53:19] <__machine> is there an easy way to check if a var is "empty" (e.g. undefined, 0, {}, []) ? undefined and 0 evaluate to false so thats ok... but {} and [] evaluate to true?
[23:53:44] <Cork> __machine: {} and [] isn't tecnically empty so no
[23:54:11] <Cork> "", 0, null and undefined can be checked with == nul (two not three)
[23:54:21] <Cork> __machine: arrays can be checked with .length
[23:54:30] <Cork> and objects you have to look the number of keys in it
[23:54:47] <Cork> (newer browsers supports Object.keys(obj).length > 0)
[23:54:55] <_pingu> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/XP6de4ex   logString contains the content of a log file possible are 2 with different format
[23:55:11] <__machine> Cork: but undefined doesnt have .length ... so i need if(x && x.length) to check for both?
[23:56:12] <Cork> __equinox: you can't check it in one go
[23:56:15] <Cork> opps
[23:56:17] <doug65536> _pingu: all of those regexs look easy and fast
[23:56:17] <Cork> *__machine:
[23:56:46] <__machine> why is {} and [] not empty but 0 is?
[23:57:04] <doug65536> __machine: objects are always true
[23:57:04] <Cork> __machine: cause the variable contains the pointer to the object
[23:57:07] <doug65536> truthy
[23:57:21] <Cork> __machine: and empty object is still an object
[23:57:39] <sylflo> hello
[23:58:17] <doug65536> _pingu: are you sure it's the regex's that are slow?
[23:58:23] <doug65536> _pingu: how are you sure
[23:58:27] <Cork> _pingu: well the /g is one things that will slow it down
[23:59:54] <doug65536> _pingu: you are mostly being specific and not being lazy with stuff that would cause heavy backtracking. I would make sure the regex is really your perf problem
