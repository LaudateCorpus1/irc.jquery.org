[00:16:48] <na3r> is there any plugin for coverFlow effect except jcoverflip ?
[01:14:17] <JakeyChan> hi, I want to let article title list can auto scroll, is there have good plugin do that ?
[01:26:54] <Skola_> could somebody tell me what a good default is for jQuery.fx.interval?
[01:27:09] <iszak> SkiDawg, check the defaults
[01:27:30] <Skola_> default is 13
[01:27:44] <Skola_> but Firefox behaves better at higher values
[01:28:04] <iszak> so you're going to tailor your site for specific browsers?
[01:28:08] <Skola_> the default is default for a reason
[01:28:25] <Skola_> but I was curious if there are certain cases where a different value might be superior
[01:28:46] <Skola_> for example when animating a specific css property
[01:29:03] <iszak> isn't that was CSS animations are for?
[01:29:44] <iszak> 13 does seem arbitrary, but it's probably been tested and we should have faith!
[01:29:55] <Skola_> Sure but is a custom interval set based on the type of animation?
[01:30:11] <iszak> no idea
[01:40:54] <Valantine> how to prevent double click on a click event in jQuery

[02:05:31] <neology> hi.. is there a way we can add objects to a paginated dataset (using will_paginate) with jquery?
[02:06:35] <neology> creating and appending new objects using javascript will require refreshing the pagination links as well?
[02:09:31] <quentin> hi folks. Is it possible to use .load with a tag instead of an ID to extract only a part of the file? ex: $('#result').load('ajax/test.html form');

[04:13:51] <odyniec> Misiur: you can set a flag in the callback and check its value in the loop
[04:17:23] <thinkster> is there a way to use ttf fonts for web pages?

[04:53:07] <K1ng> dont ask me to use $('formname').reset(); because its doesnt work for me :(
[04:53:20] <cesconix> $("#resetbuttonfornewuser").click();
[04:53:22] <cesconix> not
[04:53:26] <cesconix> $("resetbuttonfornewuser").click();
[04:54:09] <gym_jane> .seen aamir
[04:54:10] <hsbot> aamir was seen 2 weeks, 1 hour and 51 minutes ago, quitting with the message: Quit: Away!
[04:54:19] <K1ng> thanks cesconix. still doesnt work :(
[04:54:32] <raRaRa> K1ng: Does alert("Hello world"); work ?
[04:54:38] <K1ng> yes
[04:54:45] <gym_jane> hi all
[04:55:09] <coldhost> can someone help me with this script: http://www.htmldrive.net/items/show/775/Sliding-up-form-labels-with-jquery-and-CSS3 - i want it to work for input:password as well.
[04:55:14] <raRaRa> What does $('#resetbuttonfornewuser').length give you
[04:55:21] <raRaRa> If you alert that
[04:55:31] <K1ng> 0 :o
[04:55:45] <raRaRa> Aha, are you doing this on the ready handler?
[04:56:09] <K1ng> yes
[04:56:14] <raRaRa> Perhaps the HTML is loaded afterwards, so you need to have it inside  the $(document).ready(function() { }
[04:56:31] <raRaRa> Hmm, but 0 means there's no element in your HTML with the ID resetbuttonfornewuser
[04:56:32] <gym_jane> can someone please help me with a superfish vertical menu problem? I have a 2 level menu, on hover the submenu fades in and if you hover out, it fades out. I need to have the submenu visible if its parent item has class="current"
[04:57:18] <coldhost> whats wrong in doing this jQuery( 'input:text, input:password' ).each( function( ) ..
[04:57:34] <K1ng> button cant have id?
[04:57:47] <cesconix> K1ng, yes
[04:57:59] <raRaRa> K1ng: Just for fun, what happens if you do alert($('button').length);
[04:58:27] <K1ng> 3
[04:58:35] <raRaRa> Now, let's do another experiment
[04:58:48] <raRaRa> alert($('button').attr('id'));
[04:59:09] <gym_jane> anyone?
[04:59:37] <K1ng> $(".resetbuttonfornewuser").length
[04:59:38] <K1ng> 1
[04:59:45] <cesconix> have you two buttons with the same id?
[04:59:55] <K1ng> no
[05:00:20] <raRaRa> K1ng: But what do you get from the alert I told you to do last
[05:00:39] <raRaRa> Could it be that your HTML is not validated, there's missing " in some attribute or whatever
[05:00:45] <K1ng> i got the button with class name resetbuttonfornewuser now.. and i am getting length = 1 but $(".resetbuttonfornewuser").click(); doesnt work
[05:01:06] <K1ng> raRaRa, nothing
[05:01:06] <raRaRa> What happens if you click on that button yourself?√ê
[05:01:15] <K1ng> clears the form
[05:01:48] <raRaRa> Can you post the HTML somewhere
[05:02:58] <bapi__> http://pastebin.com/E4CWM74z
[05:03:14] <K1ng> raRaRa, http://k1ng.php-dev.net/sms/ user: k1ng pass: 12345
[05:03:16] <bapi__> How can I by using jquery, trim down so only 2 "generated" divs will be displayed?
[05:03:27] <K1ng> then go to users
[05:03:29] <bapi__> ie, remove the 2 at the bottom
[05:03:49] <K1ng> and then hit add user :)
[05:03:56] <raRaRa> Ok
[05:04:15] <raRaRa> Ah.. one thing came to my mind
[05:04:20] <raRaRa> since this is all ajax and stuff
[05:04:46] <cesconix> bapi__, I did not understand
[05:05:52] <bapi__> http://pastebin.com/E4CWM74z I want to remove the 2 divs at the bottom, so container only contains 3 "generated" divs
[05:05:52] <raRaRa> K1ng: When I go to the javascript console in chrome and type: $('.resetbuttonfornewuser').click();
[05:05:56] <raRaRa> It clears the form fine
[05:06:31] <K1ng> >>> $('.resetbuttonfornewuser').click();
[05:06:32] <K1ng> [button.button]
[05:06:42] <K1ng> firebugs says button.button :p
[05:06:56] <raRaRa> The problem is that you're trying to click the button when it hasn't appeared yet in the HTML
[05:07:17] <raRaRa> isn't there some afterShow event in the dialog?
[05:07:37] <K1ng> raRaRa, no
[05:08:05] <K1ng> raRaRa, click on ok without writing something. then close it
[05:08:41] <K1ng> see its become a mess
[05:08:56] <raRaRa> Okay I see the problem
[05:10:59] <cesconix> bapi__,  $('#container .generated').eq(-1).remove()
[05:11:02] <cesconix> try it
[05:11:30] <raRaRa> K1ng: Instead of using the close event, try beforeClose
[05:11:43] <raRaRa> afaik it's an event in jQuery.UI
[05:11:47] <K1ng> $('.form-error').hide(); hides them :D
[05:12:01] <raRaRa> Yeah that'd be another way to just do it manually instead of relying on the dialog
[05:13:11] <cesconix> bapi__, or try $('#container .generated:last').remove()
[05:15:24] <bapi__> ah, the generated givs get added frequently, so i need a syntax which removes all divs except the 3 on top
[05:15:41] <bapi__> the new data is prepended to the div
[05:15:42] <K1ng> raRaRa, $(".form-error").hide(); document.getElementById("newuserform").reset();
[05:16:06] <K1ng> i dont know why $("#newuserform").reset(); doesnt work
[05:16:41] <cesconix> K1ng, try $("#newuserform").get(0).reset();
[05:16:50] <raRaRa> Because it's not part of jQuery
[05:17:10] <K1ng> yay
[05:17:11] <K1ng> thanks
[05:18:12] <cesconix> bapi__, $('#container .generated:gt(3)').remove();
[05:18:37] <cesconix> ops
[05:18:41] <cesconix> bapi__, $('#container .generated:gt(2)').remove();
[05:18:56] <dragoonis> whats quicker.. .show() or .removeClass('hidden')
[05:19:03] <dragoonis> as a general good practise
[05:19:20] <dragoonis> class="hidden" is more readable, but may be slower to remove than style="display: none;"
[05:20:26] <raRaRa> dragoonis: Personally I'd use .show() because it allows you to use .hide(), .slideIn, and all those effects in cooperation to the display:none;
[05:20:37] <dragoonis> Good point
[05:20:58] <dragoonis> raRaRa: well .hidden = display: none
[05:21:01] <dragoonis> so it will still work
[05:21:55] <raRaRa> Okay, but why take extra step to do it while jQuery can just apply the display:none to your element? :)
[05:22:05] <raRaRa> Also it could be confusing to see an element with the class .hidden and yet its visible
[05:22:20] <raRaRa> Unless of course you'd always have to do appendClass, removeClass
[05:22:35] <raRaRa> which is just like re-inventing the wheel of .show and .hide
[05:23:32] <Spockz> I'm having a problem with autocomplete, when setting the value of the of a response item. I set it with an object, but when I get the value in the select function it is truncated to a string. Any Idea how to solve this?
[05:24:51] <dragoonis> Hey guys
[05:24:52] <dragoonis> $('.all-news-container').fadeIn('fast', function() { $(this).effect('shake', {times: 4}, 300); });
[05:25:10] <dragoonis> The shake doesn't actually work. after fadeIn, it just sits there doing nothing
[05:26:05] <astropirate> I have a hash/object in the html markup of an element: {prop: true, prop2: 'val2'};   How can I read this via .data()? it isn't recognized as an object. and when i do json parse it throws an error
[05:26:23] <raRaRa> What if you do $('.all-news-container').effect('shake', {times: 4}, 300); in the javascript console
[05:26:36] <raRaRa> just to make sure the shake is working or not
[05:28:52] <astropirate> anyone know how to solve the above mentioned issue?
[05:28:56] <bapi__> cesconix , thanks that worked - just one more question. How can I use this w/ .live() so it checks automaticly?
[05:29:58] <astropirate> bapi__, bind live() with a custom event name and trigger that event whenever you need something to happen
[05:31:30] <Kennie> does anyone know a nice tooltip for jquery that i can create a box like for example google's preview for search result? (i need the box, not really the content)
[05:34:08] <dragoonis> raRaRa: it says .effect() is not a valid method
[05:34:09] <dragoonis> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Shake
[05:34:18] <dragoonis> It says 'dependencies, effects core'
[05:34:33] <dragoonis> im using 1.4.2
[05:34:45] <dragoonis> I will move to 1.6.1 to test
[05:35:24] <dragoonis> i ctrl+f for "shake" in http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.1/jquery.js
[05:35:25] <bapi__> problem is, javascript:$('#generated:gt(4)').remove(); succesfully removes all divs except the 4 ontop, but whenever ajax adds new divs and I run that same command they wont be removed
[05:35:33] <dragoonis> nothing - so there must be an external file
[05:35:40] <bapi__> - javascript:
[05:36:32] <raRaRa> dragoonis: Yeah that must be the issue I assume..
[05:37:27] <Ari_> Kennie, qTip might work for you.
[05:39:45] <dragoonis> raRaRa: it is jquery ui
[05:39:49] <Ari_> bapi__, Do you have  a jsfille setup I can play with?
[05:39:50] <gym_jane> does anyone know of any good 2 level vertical menu plugins?
[05:41:33] <Ari_> bapi__, Not sure why this wouldn't work $('.foo').after('.foo:eq(2)').remove()
[05:42:10] <dragoonis> Can i include jquery.ui.effects.shake.js without including jquery.ui.core.js ?
[05:43:22] <Phil> dragoonis, you need the effects core
[05:43:27] <Phil> you don't need the UI core
[05:43:34] <Phil> http://jqueryui.com/download
[05:43:57] <dragoonis> Phil: yes i done that - thanks for clarifying
[05:44:04] <dragoonis> so just effecs core and can skip jquery ui core
[05:44:05] <dragoonis> thanks !
[05:46:53] <RandomDude> Can anybody explain to me, why the second console log here is false and not true? http://jsfiddle.net/4Ckxe/
[05:47:54] <Ari_> bapi__, Here you go: $('.foo:eq(2) ~ .foo').remove();
[05:50:24] <Phil> RandomDude, you probably want :not(table), no?
[05:50:49] <Phil> console.log("Is div not a table?", $("#test_div").is(':not(table)'));
[05:50:52] <Phil> that performs as expected
[05:50:58] <RandomDude> That explains it
[05:51:09] <RandomDude> silly me
[05:51:12] <Phil> lol
[05:51:35] <RandomDude> I read the not selector page like 5 times
[05:51:44] <RandomDude> and I still didnt realise it was :not and not not:
[05:52:55] <RandomDude> Thanks phil :)
[06:13:45] <juha____> hmm
[06:14:09] <juha____> form loses focus even if i'm jumping between different inputs inside that form?
[06:48:48] <sir_face> I'd appreciate if someone could tech me how to monkey patch a plugin ... Something like this was my guess, but alas no http://jsfiddle.net/Jy6yG/1/
[06:53:46] <MrGuy_> What's the best way to make a plugin work when called on two separate things independently
[06:54:19] <jonathansampson> MrGuy_ If I'm not mistaken, it's common practice to use an $.each() in your plugin to apply the internal logic to all matched elements.
[06:54:43] <jonathansampson> Check out the source for any one of the jQuery UI plugins for inspiration :)
[06:55:10] <MrGuy_> I mean like if you do $('#test1').plugin it doesnt affect $('#test2').plugin
[06:55:23] <MrGuy_> $.each wont solve that will it?
[06:55:47] <jonathansampson> Yes; if you only pass in a selector matching #test1, how would #test2 ever be affected?
[06:56:06] <MrGuy_> I see
[06:56:09] <jonathansampson> If your selector was [id^=test] then both #test1 and #test2 would be affected.
[06:56:14] <MrGuy_> Does this work for binding events
[06:56:22] <MrGuy_> my problem is Im using mousemove
[06:56:38] <MrGuy_> and it only works on the last thing the plugin is applied to
[06:56:40] <jonathansampson> MrGuy_ All internal logic would apply to the matched elements only (if the plugin is written properly)
[06:56:55] <MrGuy_> I see
[06:56:58] <jonathansampson> MrGuy_ What tutorial are you following for learning plugin structure?
[06:57:01] <MrGuy_> Ill take a look at the jQuery UI source
[06:57:05] <MrGuy_> thanks
[06:57:14] <MrGuy_> Im not following a tutorial atm
[06:57:25] <jonathansampson> http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern
[06:57:40] <jonathansampson> Very popular tutorial - a few years old, but still very helpful.
[06:58:26] <jonathansampson> Also, http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/03/making-a-jquery-plugin-truly-customizable
[06:58:50] <jonathansampson> I would take 30 minutes and just run through those to get a general idea of great plugin structure. Then return to your problem with a fresh set of eyes :)
[06:59:26] <MrGuy_> Cool
[06:59:31] <MrGuy_> I've saved the links
[06:59:43] <jonathansampson> Awesome, best of luck MrGuy_!
[06:59:44] <MrGuy_> so I'll get back to them when I have time
[07:05:17] <sir_face> Can anyone help me monkey patch the _Show function here http://bit.ly/mI3DAN (line 177)?? Is it even possible given how the plugin is written?
[07:06:41] <gym_jane> Can someone please help me with Superfish menu?
[07:17:27] <sir_face> t/join #javascript
[07:33:03] <gym_jane> actually, I changed my mind with superfish
[07:33:39] <gym_jane> how can i get the have the submenu visible when an item is set to "active" in left menu http://jsfiddle.net/DAbb4/
[07:37:43] <gym_jane> anyone?
[07:37:55] <hacfi> gym_jane: I always do it css-only
[07:38:12] <gym_jane> how?
[07:38:17] <gym_jane> tbh that would be even better
[07:38:41] <hacfi> gym_jane: give the ul submenu a classname
[07:40:05] <hacfi> for example <ul class="subnav">.....in css I do the following: .subnav{display:none} .active .subnav{display:block}
[07:40:19] <hacfi> if it doesn't work try: .active .subnav{display:block !important}
[07:40:41] <hacfi> well...for the active class you need jquery
[07:41:03] <hacfi> or try: li:hover .subnav{display:block}
[07:44:02] <hacfi> however, in some cases using only css makes the submenu "annoying"..it disappears immediately if your mouse leaves the button or submenu!!
[07:44:34] <hacfi> using js you can control the behaviour better
[07:47:23] <whiteman0524> hi everyone. I have a question. How do I get, dinamically loaded DOM elements height after loaded it with .load() ajax method ? As I can see, after the element loaded, it's all css attributes value is 0.
[07:47:39] <whiteman0524> sorry about my english. i don't speak it very well :)
[07:53:14] <hacfi> $('#result').load('ajax/test.html', function() {var varname; varname = $('#result').height(); alert(varname);});
[07:53:22] <hacfi> @ whiteman0524
[07:54:19] <hacfi> whiteman0524, the callback function gets executed when the dom elements have finished loading
[07:58:12] <whiteman0524> thx hacfi. but a problem is more complex. i didint load the new element into another one in the DOM. I load it into a variable that i just created dinamically in Jquery. Exaple : var variable = $('<div>'); varible.load(...); So when i try to get varible.height(); after the load complete, the value is 0.
[07:59:21] <hacfi> you need a dom element to get the height...a variable just contains that data
[08:03:28] <whiteman0524> ohh. so this is the problem. Is there any way to get that property ?
[08:04:27] <whiteman0524> I would need it
[08:05:58] <whiteman0524> I would resize the container hegiht for the newly loaded element
[08:07:01] <hacfi> but it in the container which should have a width
[08:07:13] <hacfi> why set the height at all?
[08:08:05] <hacfi> not but it - put it
[08:10:14] <K1ng> $('#users tr:last').after('<tr> <td>' + d.user.username + '</td><td>' + d.user.name + '</td><td>' + d.user.role + '</td><td>AUD $' + d.user.credit + '</td><td>' + d.user.status + '</td><td>' + d.user.createdby + '</td> <ul class="action-buttons"><li><a href="#" class="button" data-icon-primary="ui-icon-close" data-icon-only="true">Delete</a></li> <li><a href="#" class="button" data-icon-primary="ui-icon-wrench" data-icon-only="true">Modify</a></li></ul></td>'
[08:10:16] <K1ng>  );
[08:10:45] <K1ng> any idea why its not appending that to table :(
[08:13:42] <hacfi> K1ng, might not be the reason but you forget an </tr>
[08:13:48] <whiteman0524> So. I have a container with it's height. For exaple it's height is 100px. When i load into it a new element witch height it's HTML document is 120px, the "animation" is too fast and foul. I would get the new element hegiht, and then before put it into the container, i would resize the container's height. But i dont know the height :(
[08:14:00] <K1ng> :D
[08:14:06] <K1ng> thanks. let me try now
[08:14:52] <K1ng> hacfi, no luck ;(
[08:15:24] <hacfi> maybe it's the tr:last selector..
[08:15:43] <K1ng> i am using $("#users").find('tbody').append('') now
[08:15:57] <hacfi> does $('irc://irc.freenode.net/#users tr:last').after('<tr> <td>test</td></tr>'); work?
[08:16:10] <hacfi> ups
[08:16:17] <K1ng> lol
[08:16:44] <K1ng> yep
[08:18:00] <hacfi> so add the other cols on a col by col basis to find the errorcausing col
[08:18:51] <K1ng> i think i will use datatables api :D
[08:18:53] <K1ng> http://www.datatables.net/api
[08:18:57] <K1ng> fnAddData
[08:20:28] <hacfi> K1ng, if the test col works it should be no problem to add your stuff
[08:21:08] <hacfi> do you have fireburg or the webkit inspector? is there an error in the console?
[08:21:17] <K1ng> i do have firebug
[08:21:30] <K1ng> no error in console
[08:24:45] <hacfi> K1ng: is $('#users tr:last').after('<tr> <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>AUD $3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td> <ul class="action-buttons"><li><a href="#" class="button" data-icon-primary="ui-icon-close" data-icon-only="true">Delete</a></li> <li><a href="#" class="button" data-icon-primary="ui-icon-wrench" data-icon-only="true">Modify</a></li></ul></td></tr>';) working?
[08:26:33] <K1ng> hold on
[08:29:04] <K1ng> uncaught exception: [Exception... "prompt aborted by user" nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)" location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/components/nsPrompter.js :: openTabPrompt :: line 468" data: no] :p
[08:29:21] <K1ng> nvm
[08:29:51] <hacfi> that's weird.
[08:29:52] <K1ng> hacfi, yay its work but its look ugly :(
[08:30:03] <hacfi> I only removed your d. variables
[08:30:13] <K1ng> http://puu.sh/2xGW
[08:30:33] <hacfi> perfect
[08:30:51] <K1ng> {"error":0,"msg":"New user successfully created.","new":{"ID":"21","username":"k1ng111","email":"1asda@adasd.com","password":"827ccb0eea8a706c4c34a16891f84e7b","name":"asdasd","role":"5","credit":"111","joindate":"2011-06-11","createdby":"1","status":"1"}}
[08:30:53] <hacfi> so this means there is something wrong with your d.user data
[08:30:57] <K1ng> its not perfect :(
[08:31:24] <hacfi> functionality first!
[08:32:36] <hacfi> now try: alert(d.user.username); alert(d.user.name); alert(d.user.role); alert(d.user.credit); alert(d.user.status); alert(d.user.createdby);
[08:33:06] <hacfi> you have to click through all the dialoges to find out which variables causes the error
[08:35:00] <K1ng> ok
[08:36:34] <K1ng> hacfi, i get nothing
[08:37:10] <hacfi> than your d.user variable aren't defined
[08:40:06] <K1ng> hacfi, i am getting that using $.getJSON
[08:40:12] <K1ng> {"error":0,"msg":"New user successfully created.","new":{"ID":"21","username":"k1ng111","email":"1asda@adasd.com","password":"827ccb0eea8a706c4c34a16891f84e7b","name":"asdasd","role":"5","credit":"111","joindate":"2011-06-11","createdby":"1","status":"1"}}
[08:40:19] <K1ng> oops
[08:40:22] <K1ng> its should be new
[08:40:24] <K1ng> :p
[08:40:53] <albacker> is it possible to change the color of the left side of a slider (from the handler and left..)??
[08:41:11] <hacfi> K1ng: does it work now?
[08:47:32] <mrgreenfur> This might be a dumb question, but here goes: I'm cloning a div, updating bits of it and then appending it. If I clone into a variable, how do i run selectors on the variable?
[08:53:10] <unknowndomain> hey all, having an issue with jQuery in webkit browsers, it is resizing an element on my page automatically for me and in webkit that happens before the scroll bar shows up, so when it does finally show the scroll bar the whole think is the wrong size, how can i wait for loading to finish ?
[08:53:10] <unknowndomain> http://tomlynch.co.uk/rca/
[09:00:45] <mrgreenfur> oops, .filter
[09:00:45] <mrgreenfur> duh
[09:03:05] <K1ng> can anyone help me with datatables?
[09:03:11] <K1ng> $('.display').dataTable.length; gives 1
[09:04:31] <K1ng`> $('.display').dataTable.length; gives 1
[09:04:33] <K1ng`> $('.display').dataTable.fnAddData.length; gives TypeError: $(".display").dataTable.fnAddData is undefined
[09:04:35] <K1ng`> :(
[09:05:36] <pifantastic> ?p @ K1ng`
[09:05:45] <pifantastic> no bot :(
[09:05:58] <pifantastic> K1ng`: can you make a fiddle?
[09:06:06] <K1ng`> http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/dataTables/example_add_row.html
[09:06:48] <K1ng`> $('.display').dataTable().fnAddData.length;
[09:06:50] <K1ng`> YAY :D
[09:07:14] <K1ng`> its works :D
[09:10:18] <pifantastic> K1ng`: Yeah, confusingly in JS, function.length returns the number of defined arguments for the function
[09:10:31] <K1ng`> hmm
[09:11:00] <pifantastic> which is why $('.display').dataTable.length; gives 1
[09:11:34] <mrgreenfur> $('div#comment_container div#comment:last').filter('div#text') returns [] but $('div#comment_container div#comment:last div#text') returns a bunch. Why are these different?
[09:12:17] <pifantastic> mrgreenfur: you understand that IDs have to be unique, right?
[09:12:30] <pifantastic> you cant have multiple elements with the same ID
[09:12:38] <pifantastic> selecting them is undefined behavior
[09:12:55] <K1ng`> pifantastic, thanks for the tips :)
[09:13:23] <mrgreenfur> pifantastic: oh, crap. I guess I'll switch to name or class
[09:13:46] <mrgreenfur> would those two be equivelant if I was using classes for #comment and #text?
[09:14:19] <pifantastic> mrgreenfur: maybe, I dont know the structure of your HTML
[09:33:12] <djQuery> mrgreenfur: see .filter
[09:33:15] <djQuery> ?filet
[09:33:18] <djQuery> ?filter
[09:33:28] <mrgreenfur> djQuery: yah, found it! thank you
[09:33:38] <mrgreenfur> pifanastic: thanks too!
[09:34:11] <djQuery> Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.    Think what u wanted was .find or .children
[09:36:48] <ctruett> Does anyone know a good way to get the last line of a paragraph?
[09:37:15] <ctruett> I know there's the css selector :first-line, but is there something jQuery can do to return the last line?
[09:42:01] <gym_jane> guys, is it possible to animate the background colour or image of a li element?
[09:42:36] <GoGoGarrett> It requires a plugin to animate the background color I believe
[09:44:04] <gym_jane> how is that in performance terms? I mean I would like to have it but not if it is too intensive
[09:45:39] <GoGoGarrett> I'm not sure, I've only seen a guy on a screen cast use it - seemed rather effective though, but i'm not positive.  I'm sure theres a lightweight plugin for it
[09:47:20] <gym_jane> http://desizntech.info/demo/jQuery_color_animation/
[09:49:02] <GoGoGarrett> http://desizntech.info/demo/jQuery_color_animation/js/jquery.color.js
[09:53:00] <gym_jane> what i had in mind is slightly different. Basically the page loads and the <li> elements have no bg color, after 3 seconds delay the background color for each bg fills in from left to right
[10:06:54] <surrender> hi all, need help here: http://nopaste.info/ecdea1d127.html
[10:08:39] <Woet> i would love to answer it, surrender
[10:08:43] <Woet> it might help asking the actual question though
[10:09:53] <surrender> i need pointer in js =)
[10:11:03] <surrender> what i have to do, how can i set the variable phpTime (global/parent)
[10:18:48] <jeremy-> 	I'm trying to convert a blurred text-shadow css I'm using (to create a white text glow on black), using a cufon font and the textShadow: property. I cant seem to get a blur/glow to work, as textshadow only has 3 parameters from what i can see... eg 4px 4px white
[10:19:00] <jeremy-> Does anybody know what markup I should use in order to get the jquery cufon textShadow to show a blurred text hover (glow)
[10:19:35] <daevski> Can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong here?: http://pastebin.com/ckusBwuW
[10:19:49] <GoGoGarrett> in css text shadows have xOffSet, yOffSet, Blurr, Color
[10:20:12] <GoGoGarrett> ex. text-shadow: -2px 1px 3px #e3e3e3;
[10:21:18] <jeremy-> I'm okay with the css, textShadow is a cufon attribute to replicate the CSS 2 property
[10:21:43] <jeremy-> If you use a cufon it will reset your css, therefore you need to use the textShadow.. I've read a bunch of results on google all varying and im a little confused
[10:22:30] <daevski> Can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong here?: http://pastebin.com/ckusBwuW
[10:23:32] <GoGoGarrett> jeremy http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/text-shadow  I'm still seeing 4 parameters on the fuzzy text shadow section
[10:24:16] <jeremy-> You arnt understanding what I'm saying. text-shadow is a css 2.0 property
[10:24:29] <jeremy-> textShadow is part of the jquery cufon library
[10:24:39] <jeremy-> https://github.com/sorccu/cufon/wiki/styling
[10:28:03] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah you're right, it says " Please note that offsets can only be defined in pixels and that blur is not supported at all."
[10:28:10] <GoGoGarrett> oh both the github, and on the examples they show
[10:29:57] <jeremy-> I found a range of other sources citing a fourth parameter, of which the third is blur, I'm assuming that source is correct and the others are wrong
[10:30:11] <jeremy-> Its surprising that when i searched I found dozens of results claiming it could be done
[10:30:28] <GoGoGarrett> Well, I'm sure it may work in certian browsers, but I think they're saying it's not going to be cross platform
[10:30:37] <kuroir> jQuery Condoms for free https://github.com/kuroir/jQuery-Condom
[10:30:41] <kuroir> best name ever, you got to admit it.
[10:30:44] <jeremy-> Thanks for checking that, I actually didnt even notice that citing because i was skimming
[10:31:03] <jeremy-> ahh, good point. Thats probably where the false positives are coming from
[10:31:07] <daevski> Can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong here?: http://pastebin.com/ckusBwuW
[10:32:05] <kuroir> no one understands why jQuery Condom is so awesome :(
[10:32:23] <odyniec> daevski: some context please? what are you trying to do and what is actually happening?
[10:32:53] <Fox`> does val() not work with checkboxes?
[10:33:07] <Fox`> no matter what this checkbox is set to val() returns 'on'
[10:34:27] <daevski> odyniec, well... I'm trying to make the box slide left into view on hover and back away on mouse out... or unhover
[10:35:01] <daevski> odyniec, nothing is actually happening because the syntax is wrong (my editor shows red lines) for the IF statements.
[10:35:55] <jeremy-> Just realised I should use a background image to replicate the blur functionality for cufons. Thanks for looking over my issue guys :) seeya
[10:36:08] <odyniec> daevski: your editor is right, you're passing parameters to .css as if it were an object, but without the {}'s
[10:36:22] <devinrolsen> Fox, if you are trying to determine if the checkbox is checked or not, use something like if($('input').is(':checked')){ ... }. If you are trying to set the check on a checkbox: $('input').attr('checked','checked');
[10:37:05] <odyniec> daevski: try this: .css({ left: "-340px" })
[10:37:20] <devinrolsen> he said slide though odyniec
[10:37:32] <daevski> odyniec, still errors with that. but thank you for that correction. I missed it.
[10:38:00] <daevski> odyniec, Works I think. One sec
[10:39:01] <daevski> odyniec, hmm now just error with the last bracket set at the bottom.
[10:39:21] <daevski> odyniec, the final )};
[10:40:03] <odyniec> daevski: add another });
[10:40:45] <daevski> odyniec, ah :) thanks. I'll get there.... now lets see if it functions as intended...
[10:41:52] <daevski> odyniec, yeah, so the functionality is wrong too. It just swings in and out on it's own.
[10:42:09] <odyniec> daevski: actually what are you trying to do with those ifs? are they supposed to check the current value of "left"?
[10:42:15] <GoGoGarrett> dadvski http://jsfiddle.net/HHYP9/ this is what i got to clean it up a little, but i'm not sure if it's working as intended
[10:42:19] <daevski> I tried with mouseenter / mouseleave (and mouseout) but those all do the same thing as this one.
[10:42:26] <daevski> odyniec, yes
[10:43:34] <odyniec> daevski: then you should do this: if ($(this).css("left") == "-340px")
[10:44:03] <daevski> odyniec, alright. That looks like a sound way to do it.
[10:50:13] <daevski> odyniec, okay much better, but now I can tell I don't want .hover() because it's still hovering when it comes out, and I want more of a mouseleave/mouseout for it to disappear again. What should I use?
[10:52:02] <Misiur> wtf, $.getJSON has good return when I display [{"data": 12341, "price": 1.23}], but when I display [{"price":1.23}] then I get [ ]
[10:54:53] <odyniec> daevski: I guess it should work with hover, but you need to split the code into two functions, like GoGoGarrett posted it for you
[10:55:26] <odyniec> daevski: one to be called on hover, the other one on mouseleave
[10:56:40] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/HHYP9/1/
[10:58:57] <daevski> odyniec, so duplicate it and change hover to mouseleave? I'll try that
[10:59:16] <daevski> odyniec, if not, I got it working with .click() but it's not as kewl lol
[10:59:33] <odyniec> daevski: no, you need to pass two functions as parameters to .hover()
[10:59:46] <daevski> odyniec, oh oh oh , like G said up htere?
[10:59:59] <daevski> thank you GoGoGarrett
[11:00:31] <GoGoGarrett> No problem :]
[11:01:40] <daevski> GoGoGarrett, that seems to do nothing. I have no action at all from it, but also no errors.
[11:02:32] <GoGoGarrett> I am not sure what all you're working with, but i'm assuming it's having to do with the if statement not being meet.  perhaps change it to .css("left") > "-340px" or something, i'm not sure.
[11:03:43] <odyniec> daevski: try removing the first if altogether
[11:04:15] <odyniec> daevski: just leave the animate call
[11:04:42] <juha____> $.extend() doesn't understan object.type variable=?
[11:06:09] <daevski> odyniec,  just sliding in and out then.
[11:07:55] <odyniec> daevski: does the mouse pointer leave the menu box when it's sliding in?
[11:10:15] <daevski> odyniec, no, but I got it now. I duplicated what I had and just made the second mouseleave
[11:10:41] <kobsu> hello, I'm trying to dynamically remove ui-selectee from selectable list in selected event, but the selectee is still selectable... am i missing something? http://pastie.org/2053112
[11:10:53] <daevski> odyniec, it still seems a little buggy, so I might just use .click()... that way the user has to command it and not just hover it by accident.
[11:11:07] <daevski> odyniec, I'm content. Thank you just much; GoGoGarrett also.
[11:12:05] <odyniec> daevski: you're welcome :)
[11:38:44] <amid_hasan> hello
[11:39:09] <devinrolsen> hi
[11:39:23] <amid_hasan> Text isn't working on toggle. Maybe someone can figure this out? http://jsfiddle.net/forrester/EuArW/
[11:40:17] <sir_face> Can anyone think of a way to monkey patch this method in this plugin? Driving me nuts.
[11:40:49] <sir_face> Oops. http://jsfiddle.net/umSmV/
[11:42:14] <sean`> sir_face, you need to include the plugin
[11:42:23] <sean`> and then access the prorotype of the function
[11:43:17] <sean`> sir_face, in the case of bubbletip it's alot easier to just alter the js file itself than to monkey patch it
[11:43:28] <sir_face> sean`: I think this is a special case because of how the target function has been defined. Its defined in the constructor ... so $.bubbletip.prototype._Calculate == undefined ...
[11:43:48] <sean`> because the _Calculate function is defined inside .bubbletip
[11:43:55] <sean`> so yo ucan't access it the way you're used to
[11:44:19] <sean`> you need to verwrite the bubbletip prototype to actually change the method, therefor, accessing the jsfile itself is better
[11:45:04] <sir_face> sean`: Ugh. Really didnt want to do that. Damn.
[11:45:51] <odyniec> amid_hasan: use toggle -> http://jsfiddle.net/EuArW/1/
[11:46:45] <amid_hasan> odyniec: perfect. thanks! the toggle event is like click event?
[11:49:25] <odyniec> amid_hasan: yup
[12:13:05] <quuxman> I want an element with a width of 100% with padding, but have the padding included in the 100% width so it doesn't overflow the parent
[12:14:45] <quuxman> I guess I have to put the padding on the parent
[12:18:51] <GoGoGarrett> Do something like this and see if it helps
[12:18:54] <GoGoGarrett> -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
[12:18:54] <GoGoGarrett>  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
[12:18:54] <GoGoGarrett>  box-sizing: border-box;
[12:19:25] <GoGoGarrett> I believe it includes the padding/margin and width all in one element instead of width then padding then border->margin
[12:44:33] <progrock> anyone know how to prototype onto the arguments object available to functions?
[12:48:18] <xsamurai> is there built in regex capabilities in jquery or do i have to use a plugin , im trying to get x and y from name that looks like sub(x)_form(y)_test
[13:10:35] <danniel> hi, i'm doing a multiuser tasklist
[13:11:10] <danniel> and needing to do an alert when task is updated or have new comment
[13:11:56] <danniel> and I have no idea how to do this!
[13:18:18] <blackthorne> hi
[13:18:38] <blackthorne> I'm using effects like FadeIn and FadeOut
[13:18:50] <blackthorne> my problem is that they don't seem to be synchronous
[13:19:02] <blackthorne> if I do something like   $("#items_view").fadeOut();            $("#items_view").html(result);
[13:19:19] <blackthorne> #items_view will get its html replaced before being fully faded out
[13:19:39] <blackthorne> how can I make it sequential?
[13:19:46] <ravenzz> mh try
[13:19:50] <kobsu> how can i dynamically define selectees not selectable? I tried this http://pastie.org/2053112
[13:19:53] <ravenzz> $("#items_view").fadeOut().html(result);
[13:20:20] <blackthorne> ravenzz: same effect..
[13:20:56] <blackthorne> I can see the new html even before the div gets faded out
[13:21:50] <ravenzz> so
[13:21:53] <ravenzz> try this
[13:22:12] <ravenzz> $("#items_view").fadeOut(function() { $(this).html(result) });
[13:22:57] <blackthorne> ravenzz: that worked! thank you very much!
[13:23:28] <ravenzz> tipically you can find your answer looking at the documentation
[13:23:51] <ravenzz> http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
[13:35:36] <MrNibbles> haha check out my ridiculous image gallery thing
[13:35:38] <MrNibbles> http://www.nicefrontend.com/demos/gallery/
[13:35:46] <MrNibbles> safari/chrome only at the mo :(
[13:35:49] <MrNibbles> ooh and iOs
[13:35:55] <MrNibbles> looks rather nice on the iPhone
[13:36:13] <MrNibbles> it randomly generates the transtitions
[13:36:20] <GoGoGarrett> Looks really nice, dang haha
[13:37:23] <MrNibbles> GoGoGarrett :D ty!
[13:37:28] <GoGoGarrett> Did you write it all?
[13:37:58] <MrNibbles> yeah
[13:38:10] <MrNibbles> im adding a few more transitions now
[13:38:14] <MrNibbles> just working on a wipe effect
[13:38:57] <MrNibbles> the source code is commented, your welcome to mess with it
[13:39:12] <GoGoGarrett> I'm still a scrub, but i'm reading through it at the moment haha
[13:48:45] <GoGoGarrett> I want to make cool stuff like that >:{
[13:53:55] <MrNibbles> GoGoGarrett: you can!
[13:54:56] <GoGoGarrett> I've read 3 books so far, and I'm still no pro.  I honestly just need some more real world problems to work on I believe
[13:55:57] <ravenzz> oh that's nice ;)
[13:56:11] <ravenzz> you miss a padding at the bottom :P
[13:56:52] <ravenzz> MrNibbles is that css3?
[13:57:43] <MrNibbles> GoGoGarrett: thats the key, find something fun to make!
[13:58:05] <MrNibbles> ravenzz: yeah it is, feel free to pull the source apart
[13:58:17] <MrNibbles> im going to put it up on github when its a bit more fleshed our
[13:58:18] <MrNibbles> out*
[13:59:01] <ravenzz> you could add some controls too
[13:59:47] <MrNibbles> ravenzz: yeah, when its finished im going to have a load of sliders that allow you to make your own transitions, and even press a button to generate the object code to use that on your own site
[14:00:23] <ravenzz> oh that's cool too,
[14:00:55] <ravenzz> but i talking about a control bar...to control the slideshow
[14:01:13] <ravenzz> play, stop, next, prev and so on
[14:01:54] <MrNibbles> hehe yeah that will be there too :)
[14:02:11] <MrNibbles> its just something i decided to stick together this weekend
[14:02:15] <MrNibbles> its nowhere near finished
[14:03:39] <ravenzz> yep, that's awesome
[14:04:17] <MrNibbles> thanks dude
[14:06:45] <danniel> hi, i'm doing a multiuser tasklist
[14:07:26] <danniel> and needing to change style of task title when have an update or new comment into
[14:12:13] <MrNibbles> danniel: if you pastebin or jsfiddle your code im sure we can help
[14:13:10] <xsamurai> whats wrong with this http://jsfiddle.net/aq2SN/ ?
[14:13:40] <danniel> MrNibbles: but there's no code yet
[14:14:00] <danniel> MrNibbles: only a list of items and one idea :)
[14:16:46] <ravenzz> xsamurai i suppose that you should use test()
[14:17:05] <ravenzz> or any other regex function
[14:24:02] <MrNibbles> xsamurai: http://jsfiddle.net/MrNibbles/aq2SN/1/ - your syntax is wrong
[14:24:24] <MrNibbles> you need to specify match on the string
[14:24:48] <xsamurai> MrNibbles: ahhh thanks =), didnt find too many docs on regex & jquery online, see different solutions from various sources
[14:25:11] <ravenzz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[14:25:18] <MrNibbles> xsamurai: no worries, regex is generally a pain in the arse
[14:27:42] <xsamurai> i dont mind i enjoy it a bit, most languages have  some documentation on the matter, its pretty straight forward just the lack of documentation drove me crazy
[14:27:54] <gym_jane> i am trying to get these testimonials to fadein and out but not having much luck http://jsfiddle.net/mEdBc/
[14:29:07] <gym_jane> i just want the text bit to fadein/out
[14:29:17] <gym_jane> and one testimonial at a time
[14:32:56] <johtso> Does jsonp require full trust in the server you send the request to? Can they respond with any javascript that they like and it will be executed in the users browser?
[14:34:05] <ravenzz> gym_jane you could use a plugin to do that
[14:34:11] <ravenzz> like jCarousel
[14:34:28] <gym_jane> ok never heard of that
[14:34:31] <gym_jane> let me see
[14:34:52] <ravenzz> http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/
[14:35:00] <ravenzz> http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_auto.html
[14:35:32] <ravenzz> http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_vertical.html
[14:35:46] <ravenzz> you should mix these two examples
[14:35:55] <gym_jane> what do you mean by mix?
[14:36:21] <ravenzz> go for the vertical carousel, and enable the autoscroll
[14:37:01] <_beau> so many image galleries
[14:37:26] <_beau> i prefer either jquery.cycle or nivo personally
[14:37:35] <_beau> too many to choose from :P
[14:37:43] <ravenzz> yep
[14:38:01] <ravenzz> i tryied nivo
[14:38:14] <ravenzz> but i found jcarousel more flexible
[14:38:25] <GoGoGarrett> Check out my sexy unproductive tab'er :P http://jsfiddle.net/RvqLB/
[14:41:36] <Marz> is it possible to bind enter key to not submit form?
[14:42:55] <gym_jane> Uncaught Error: jCarousel: No width/height set for items. This will cause an infinite loop. Aborting...
[14:42:55] <raRaRa> Yes
[14:42:59] <raRaRa> @ MarcelT3
[14:43:03] <raRaRa> er Marz
[14:43:13] <ravenzz> gym_jane have you included the css?
[14:43:29] <gym_jane> no but i set width and height for <li>
[14:43:33] <ravenzz> you should set the height/width of elements
[14:43:56] <raRaRa> Marz: You can check keypress on all inputs of a form, if the key is 13 then return false
[14:43:59] <raRaRa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/699065/submitting-a-form-on-enter-with-jquery
[14:44:04] <ravenzz> also they should be visible
[14:44:32] <ravenzz> i have to go
[14:44:34] <ravenzz> bye
[14:48:05] <Marz> does anyone know of a form plugin that will duplicate your textfield for you to enter another item?
[14:48:24] <Marz> raRaRa: will do thanks
[14:51:55] <_beau> Marz: no, i've always just written custom logic
[15:05:28] <gym_jane> guys do you know of any good plugins for testimonial rotation?
[15:08:06] <Valantine> what to do if I want to call the #info click function by the button click
[15:08:06] <Valantine> http://jsfiddle.net/lonewolfs/68WMm/6/
[15:10:14] <odyniec> Valantine: you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/68WMm/7/
[15:12:20] <gym_jane> i am trying to get these testimonials to fadein and out but not having much luck http://jsfiddle.net/mEdBc/
[15:15:21] <GoGoGarrett> like, one at a time, in the same area?
[15:15:40] <gym_jane> yes
[15:15:58] <gym_jane> just want the text to fadein and out
[15:17:23] <gym_jane> oh and for some reason the background slidesup :(
[15:17:30] <gym_jane> i want that to be static
[15:19:44] <ElGoorf> hey, quick issue: http://www.webdevout.net/test?030&raw     if you view in chrome, and shrink/scroll the window so that the 3 icons appear near the top, the bubble appears underneath, but it doesnt happen in ie/ff?
[15:24:05] <glen1> im thinking about making a silly webapp, but im curious how i would make buttons that pass info to the backend, like delete buttons. Is this done by using simple ajax function?
[15:31:02] <odyniec> gym_jane: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mEdBc/4/
[15:31:49] <GoGoGarrett> dang, beat me to it :/
[15:32:50] <odyniec> didn't know there was a competition going on :)
[15:33:17] <GoGoGarrett> well mine isn't working, so I guess not haha
[15:33:29] <gym_jane> odyniec that is brilliant
[15:33:34] <gym_jane> thank you
[15:33:39] <gym_jane> and you GoGoGarrett :D
[15:33:48] <odyniec> gym_jane: no problem
[15:35:41] <gym_jane> and now to find out where i was going wrong :-/
[15:52:52] <Marz> hey, how can i bind a keypress and a blur to the same el?
[15:52:58] <Phelms215> Hey, guys I have a question for someone - I am using dynamic forms (add row link below to allow unlimited entries) and submiting through AJAX. I was having a problem of grabbing the unlimited amount of data through JQUERY but figured that I could use the .each() feature to shuffle through.. worked like a charm
[15:53:06] <Phelms215> except one problem..
[15:53:40] <Phelms215> when I run the form for each one it grabs the value from the very first input field and not from the one inside of that each
[15:56:36] <Marz> is .bind('keypress, blur', function(){}); legit?
[15:56:45] <Marz> ityas and i didnt work..
[15:57:13] <sean`> Marz, no, remove the comma
[15:57:19] <sean`> 'keypress blur'
[15:57:49] <sean`> and then you can do function (e) { console.log (e.type) }
[16:01:59] <Marz> sean`: thanks
[16:03:40] <rastof> with this code http://pastebin.com/2Cf8vC0Y  i am trying to add line 38 to the parent node but its not working. any idea?
[16:09:16] <sean`> rastof, you want to alter the parent/
[16:09:23] <sean`> this.parentNode will give you access tot he parent
[16:10:39] <rastof> thank you sean
[16:24:19] <Jantire> I know you guys are for javascript, but #css isn't responding and more than likely you guys know plenty about CSS, so I'm just going to ask here
[16:24:36] <Jantire> http://jsfiddle.net/zSnQC/3/ - the #navigation bar is down around 5-8 pixels, even with padding set to 0 and margin set to 0
[16:24:47] <Jantire> Why is that, when it should be at the very top of the page
[16:24:50] <Jantire> and how do I fix it?
[16:35:04] <shesek> Jantire, maybe #header has padding?
[16:35:35] <shesek> always start your css with a css reset, a simple *{padding:0;padding:0;} at the very beginning would usually be enough
[16:40:21] <GoGoGarrett> What are you trying to do Jantire?
[17:17:40] <khaan> hi everybody, i got a small question to ask - i need to "guess" a function from a script but i need a little help since i'm quite of a n00b
[17:17:45] <khaan> can anyone help me?
[17:17:50] <khaan> please :)
[17:21:09] <Krinkle> khaan: could you be more descriptive ? What are you trying to do ?
[17:21:27] <khaan> hi krinkle :) thanks for being there
[17:21:32] <khaan> i am using the quicksand jquery script
[17:21:45] <khaan> and i need to automatically trigger a function on page ready
[17:21:52] <khaan> http://razorjack.net/quicksand/demos/one-set-clone.html
[17:21:57] <Krinkle> ok
[17:22:01] <khaan> here, i need to trigger the class "home"
[17:22:07] <khaan> when the page is ready
[17:22:12] <khaan> sorry
[17:22:13] <khaan> not the class
[17:22:16] <kwaa> Hey, can someone please help me with an if condition?
[17:22:16] <khaan> the "data id"
[17:22:17] <khaan> so to say
[17:23:14] <Krinkle> What is "data id"
[17:23:19] <Krinkle> attr('id') ?
[17:23:22] <khaan> data id is a wordpress attribute
[17:23:31] <Krinkle> what does the html element look like
[17:23:37] <Krinkle> <div data-id="..."> ?
[17:24:06] <kwaa> I really need help with some very easy stuff, wont take more than a few minutes.
[17:24:12] <khaan> the call for the thing i'm trying to obtain to be automatically is <a href="#" data-value="all" id="homeButton">Home</a
[17:24:30] <khaan> actually it's a category
[17:24:41] <jonathansampson> kwaa How can I help?
[17:24:50] <Krinkle> Do you want it to sort by "data-value" (all) or "id" (homeButton) or "text" (Home)
[17:24:52] <Krinkle> khaan:
[17:25:04] <khaan> i want to sort it by category home
[17:25:05] <khaan> li class="segment-0" id="'. $category->name.'" > <a href="#" data-value="'. $category->name.'">
[17:25:11] <khaan> this is another call
[17:25:17] <khaan> i'm sorry for being so lame :)
[17:25:36] <khaan> i'm trying to guess it with you
[17:25:36] <Krinkle> khaan: In that case create a custom sort that does return $(something).data( 'value' );// returns data-value attribute
[17:25:49] <khaan> mmm can you make me an example?
[17:25:50] <kwaa> jonathansampson: writing a post on the forum about it right now, to be extra clear... Will give you a link, thanks
[17:26:06] <jonathansampson> kwaa Alright.
[17:26:26] <khaan> i suppose that it's $("#list")
[17:26:35] <khaan> that, i know
[17:27:52] <Krinkle> khaan: The link you provided has an example: khaan: In that case create a custom sort that does return $(something).data( 'id' );
[17:27:52] <khaan> i'm trying to understand from the example
[17:27:58] <Krinkle> / Custom sorting plugin
[17:28:09] <khaan> that's beyond my knowledge :)
[17:28:43] <Krinkle> Simply copy/paste and use $(....).sorted({ by: function(a){    return a.dat('value');     });
[17:28:53] <Krinkle> data*
[17:30:43] <khaan> like $("#list").sorted({ by: function(a){    return a.data('home');});
[17:30:44] <khaan> ?
[17:33:29] <sosman> I have a simple ajax query with callback inline in <head> element.  When I move the callback to external .js file it doesn't work - the callback does not get called.
[17:34:12] <Krinkle> khaan: If you have <element data-home="blablabla"> ..</element>, then yes.
[17:35:54] <khaan> first attempt wasn't working
[17:35:56] <khaan> let me double check
[17:40:12] <kwaa> jonathansampson: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/an-if-statment-with-href
[17:41:03] <nibl> Anybody know how I contact a jquery site admin?
[17:42:10] <kwaa> jonathansampson: http://pastebin.com/XVnnrxHM
[17:42:11] <kwaa> http://pastebin.com/XVnnrxHM
[17:42:16] <kwaa> Please help me with this issue
[17:42:18] <khaan> something's not working
[17:42:29] <kwaa> Shouldnt be too hard for you :)
[17:42:31] <sosman> My html page wired for inline (working) code is http://kpaste.net/ec7aef0f1
[17:44:31] <sosman> I would like to replace the submit handler starting line 24 with that on line 18 where the callback is processEventIDLookup in netforensics.js
[17:45:50] <jonathansampson> nibl What's the problem?
[17:46:56] <kwaa> Please help me solve this really easy, if you know jQuery, problem: http://pastebin.com/XVnnrxHM
[17:47:08] <kwaa> I've explained it well in the pastebin
[17:47:19] <jonathansampson> kwaa I think I understand your question.
[17:47:37] <khaan> krinkle, i was looking at this http://razorjack.net/quicksand/docs-and-demos.html#examples
[17:47:39] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Kinda know how it would be done?
[17:47:48] <jonathansampson> So you have a set of links #graphics, #web, #print, representing a set of divs #print-div, #web-div, #graphics-div.
[17:47:48] <khaan> very top of the page
[17:48:00] <jonathansampson> When you click #graphics, you want to show #graphics-div but hide all other divs.
[17:48:10] <Krinkle> khaan: I can help you with jQuery specific things, but I dont know that plugin, so either ask someone else or contact that plugin author :)
[17:48:12] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Correct
[17:48:25] <jonathansampson> You can use jQuery UI tabs for this very thing.
[17:48:28] <khaan> krinkle: i wrote the guy :)
[17:48:30] <jonathansampson> This is exactly what it does :)
[17:48:33] <khaan> don't think i don't did
[17:48:37] <Krinkle> ok
[17:48:42] <sosman> Assuming the script in netforensics.js is correct, should this just work or are there script load ordering issues?
[17:48:43] <nibl> The plugin I wan to use has no license. Can the admin contact the author pls and ask?
[17:48:48] <khaan> i'm just trying to work out a simple thing out of my ignorance ;)
[17:48:52] <kwaa> jonathansampson: I'm going to try, thank you.
[17:48:54] <khaan> thanks anyway :)
[17:48:57] <nibl> I cannot access the authors contact page
[17:49:12] <jonathansampson> kwaa You're welcome.
[17:49:40] <jonathansampson> nibl Which plugin is it?
[17:50:26] <nibl> jqueryInk: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Ink
[17:51:48] <frustratedcoder> The themeroller is broken again. Can someone please tell me if there is a way for me to get my custom theme today, a workaround or standalone verion of the roller maybe?
[17:52:10] <khaan> krinkle: one jquery thing then. Can i trigger an action on document(load) instad of having some $('#source') at the beginning?
[17:52:45] <frustratedcoder> $(window).load(function(){});
[17:53:08] <khaan> thks frustrated :)
[17:53:14] <frustratedcoder> :-)
[17:54:11] <frustratedcoder> frustrating to spend billablet ime generating a theme fr a client's site only to have it come out flay grey and white cause the themeroller just ain't feeling it today
[17:54:18] <Krinkle> khaan: Do you want it to happen when the document is ready or when the window is ready ?
[17:54:37] <Krinkle> $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); // happens when the browser has parsed the <html>
[17:54:38] <khaan> when the window is ready.
[17:54:48] <Krinkle> $(window).load(function(){ ... }); // happens when the browser has downloaded all images etc.
[17:54:51] <frustratedcoder> indeed window.load is after all files are download. document.ready can occur when the html is ready but before images are done loading
[17:54:59] <Krinkle> window.load is after document.ready
[17:55:13] <khaan> yep, but i can't load all images before - there's a ton and the page would take ages
[17:55:18] <khaan> before it'd show up
[17:55:26] <frustratedcoder> then you want .ready
[17:55:26] <khaan> so i'm going for window
[17:55:33] <khaan> yes
[17:55:38] <khaan> ah.
[17:55:39] <frustratedcoder> no window.load will not fire until ALL youre images are downloaded
[17:55:46] <khaan> i see your point :)
[17:55:57] <jonathansampson> nibl The author appeas to be "Jan Stria".
[17:56:01] <frustratedcoder> document.ready will fire when the browser is ready to let you play with the dom whcih occures way before all your images download
[17:56:32] <khaan> the damn example presumes i'm starting from a click or something
[17:56:38] <khaan> but i don't want it to happen on clicks
[17:56:39] <frustratedcoder> didn't mean to step on you kinkle, just didn't see you reply and idling here patiently awaiting some help with getting my jquery theme
[17:56:42] <khaan> it has to happen when i enter
[17:57:08] <frustratedcoder> ah yeah just ignore that. do your $(document).ready(function(){ put your code here })
[17:57:29] <khaan> fr:)
[17:57:42] <nibl> Yes, Jan Stria. But I cannot contact him. Do you know how? There's no license info in the source code either.
[17:58:04] <khaan> the point is there: http://razorjack.net/quicksand/docs-and-demos.html#examples -> if you check how it triggers, the function is like $('#source').quicksand( $('#destination li'), function() {
[17:58:11] <kwaa> jonathansampson: http://pastie.org/2054456
[17:58:19] <kwaa> jonathansampson: "almost made it"
[17:58:21] <khaan> i want to make the first part unnecessary
[17:58:39] <khaan> has to reorder stuff automatically
[17:58:43] <khaan> before user's decision
[17:59:31] <frustratedcoder> I wish I could stay and help more but I'm on the clock and if I can't get help with the jquery ui well.. poop I hope it's fixed tmorrow
[17:59:55] <frustratedcoder> was a very nice theme too and an oddly coloured site which matches none of the default themes
[18:00:08] <jonathansampson> nibl http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/ftp/articles/prusa/Prusa-TR-2010-19.pdf
[18:00:17] <jonathansampson> Email address on the front page.
[18:01:05] <kwaa> http://pastie.org/2054456 really need help with that
[18:03:24] <nibl> Jonathan, many Thanks. How did you find the PDF? I only found some Jan Stria's on Linkedin and Facebook, but didn't know which was correct.
[18:03:55] <jonathansampson> nibl The force is strong with me in the Galaxy of Google ;)
[18:04:24] <GoGoGarrett> haha
[18:05:24] <nibl> Unearthly for sure. Thanks again :-)
[18:05:52] <jonathansampson> nibl My pleasure. Amazing project - thanks for introducing me to Jan Stria's work.
[18:06:32] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Basicly I want to change one div from another (+ it's contents) by a click
[18:06:41] <kwaa> Can someone please help me with doing that?
[18:06:49] <khaan> i am losing, lol
[18:06:55] <jonathansampson> kwaa Can you post your HTML?
[18:09:28] <kwaa> jonathansampson: http://pastie.org/2054492
[18:10:12] <jonathansampson> kwaa Got it. Hold for me just a moment.
[18:10:14] <kwaa> jonathansampson: but the images should range from 5-9 there, if your curious
[18:10:22] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Thanks alot.
[18:13:03] <LHC> a bit confused bout this, but if I have a delete button in my application that posts and id to a php file. Would I just use the ajax function?
[18:13:21] <jonathansampson> kwaa For starters, don't use the same ID for both slider panels :)
[18:13:39] <jonathansampson> ID values should only appear once per page.
[18:13:54] <jonathansampson> Instead, <div class="slider" id="web-slider"> would be better.
[18:13:58] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Yeah, I intended to only have one, and then change it's content ^^
[18:14:02] <kwaa> Alright, I will change that.
[18:14:09] <jonathansampson> I'll change it in my code too.
[18:14:38] <Guest65405> Hey, quick question using jquery $.ajax
[18:14:41] <Guest65405> function
[18:15:04] <sosman> Ok I put a couple of comments in html code http://kpaste.net/19fba428 and external javascript is http://kpaste.net/b98bf8d0e
[18:15:06] <Guest65405> after I send it to PHP when it comes back what variable do I use to get the response from the php file
[18:15:28] <sosman> Any help on why it doesn't work when I move inline script to external file would be greatly appreciated.
[18:16:21] <Guest65405> @sosman r u using type=application/javascript ?
[18:16:52] <sosman> You mean line 7 & 8?
[18:17:59] <Guest65405> i didnt look at your script, just a guess in your <script src="" type="application/javascript"></script>
[18:18:28] <sosman> It was 'text/javascript' but I just changed it to application/javascript and same result.
[18:19:21] <Guest65405> link
[18:19:50] <sosman> Guest65405: http://kpaste.net/19fba428
[18:20:35] <sosman> Guest65405: netforensics.js is http://kpaste.net/b98bf8d0e
[18:21:28] <jonathansampson> kwaa http://jsbin.com/oyedi3/edit This?
[18:22:43] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Superawesome, thank you sooo much!
[18:22:48] <kwaa> There's only one thing
[18:22:59] <jonathansampson> kwaa You're welcome. To hide the first $(".slider:first").hide()
[18:23:12] <jonathansampson> Or to hide all others $(".slider:not(:first)").hide();
[18:24:08] <jonathansampson> kwaa http://jsbin.com/oyedi3/2/edit Hides all but first automagically.
[18:24:28] <Guest65405> sosman your not using smarty are you?
[18:25:11] <sosman> Guest65405: I don't think so (this is my first crack at javascript/jquery).
[18:25:40] <Tallisman> if a user needs to have a large input field, what would you guys use? words inside the input field must be bold, something like that. there also has to be line numbering.. how should i do this :P?
[18:26:40] <kwaa> jonathansampson: SOOOO AWESOME :)
[18:28:51] <jonathansampson> kwaa Actually, you can make it one line: $(".chose a").click(function(e){$( $(e.target).attr('href') ).show().siblings(".slider").hide();}).filter(":first").trigger("click");
[18:30:32] <Tallisman> euhm.. in development you should never make such a long code one line, it won't be able to be read easily
[18:30:49] <Tallisman> when you're done you should minify it though ^^
[18:30:59] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Thanks, so much :)
[18:31:30] <Woet> Tallisman: I let my framework minify + compress + cache it for me, so I can keep developing with commented and neatly outlined code
[18:31:38] <kwaa> jonathansampson: I got another issue as this started to work tho... For whatever reason it scrolls down alittle?
[18:31:44] <kwaa> jonathansampson: I'll give you an url.
[18:31:53] <Woet> one of my coworkers used to minify it in the file itself, and then he was fucked when he had to make a change :P
[18:32:16] <devinrolsen> is there a way to test if each url in an array belongs to the same domain or not?
[18:32:39] <Tallisman> yea :)
[18:33:07] <Tallisman> euhm, to devinrolson.. I suppose so
[18:33:25] <Tallisman> you could use substring to get the domain, and then match the urls against it
[18:33:52] <Tallisman> maybe the location object also has some functions to help you out
[18:35:31] <jonathansampson> I've got to get some work done - you guys take care.
[18:36:00] <Tallisman> :P
[18:36:58] <kwaa> jonathansampson: http://hemligt.imkwaa.com/
[18:37:16] <kwaa> Try to press the links for it to change.
[18:37:25] <kwaa> You'll see that the page scrolls down...
[18:37:55] <kwaa> jonathansampson: Apparently not... Sorry. Thanks so freaking much for the help.
[18:39:02] <Tallisman> kwaa, your site works just fine :P
[18:39:25] <kwaa> Tallisman: ^^ :)
[18:39:31] <devinrolsen> kwaa+1 for building out layout patterns in your template.
[18:40:27] <Tallisman> derp
[18:41:01] <kwaa> :)
[18:41:22] <Tallisman> anyhoe, devinrolsen, do you know what i should use to display a document with page numbering, and text effects like centering and bold?
[18:42:08] <Tallisman> I thought about textarea, but that seems to limit, ALOT, so should I make a div for every line with spans?, or something else?
[18:42:32] <devinrolsen> oh you mean a wysisyg?
[18:42:42] <Tallisman> sort of :P
[18:51:24] <Tallisman> soooo :P?
[18:57:55] <sosman> Trying to use external javascript function as callback with no luck - inline version works.  Any clues please?  html: http://kpaste.net/19fba428 external javascript: http://kpaste.net/b98bf8d0e
[18:58:42] <Tallisman> @sosman jsfiddle.net
[19:00:53] <sosman> Tallisman: http://jsfiddle.net/BPvuE/
[19:02:26] <xsamurai> i have a form with simple drop downs in a colorbox pop up, i would like to pass the selected value back to the main page, either on close or when submit is pressed
[19:02:48] <xsamurai> i would prefer not to pass data via url
[19:03:11] <Tallisman> @sosman, are you 100 % sure the paths are correct?
[19:05:07] <sosman> Tallisman: I can call the foo function
[19:07:01] <Tallisman> @xsamurai, if you do not want to use the url you can use other options, such as saving it to a variable and make sure the page does not reload :P
[19:07:15] <sosman> Tallisman: which presumably means the paths are right.
[19:07:15] <Tallisman> @sosman hmm..
[19:07:43] <xsamurai> Tallisman: i was trying to avoid page not reload as well but i think i'll go that route
[19:07:59] <sosman> Tallisman: so bugs/silly-errors aside, this should just work right?
[19:08:58] <Tallisman> if you do not want to disable page reload you should go the ajax route and do something with sessions or $_POST, @xsamurai
[19:09:17] <Tallisman> to sosman, it should just work indeed, have you tryed to echo out the data variable?
[19:09:26] <Tallisman> (without any handling)
[19:09:59] <Tallisman> to see whether the function was executed or returning something..
[19:10:22] <Tallisman> as a side note, how does your serverside file look like you are calling to?
[19:11:10] <sosman> Tallisman: just tried alert(data) - I don't believe the function is even being called.
[19:11:28] <sosman> Tallisman: sends back some JSON
[19:11:43] <sosman> The inline code parses it fine
[19:14:13] <Tallisman> seems like the external callback does not obtain the data varialbe..
[19:14:47] <sosman> Tallisman: my javascript fu is not strong - first application here.  Firebug doesn't even break in processEventIDLookup()
[19:14:49] <kwaa> Heya
[19:14:56] <kwaa> http://pastebin.com/xHCv7jVX
[19:15:21] <kwaa>  How do I make that work, with the exeption of <a href="#graphical-slider"> and <a href="#web-slider">
[19:15:51] <kwaa> Can someone add an exeption for those two instances please?
[19:18:46] <Tallisman> @sosman, after calling the external callback you do not return false in the submit handler, might be it.
[19:20:18] <Tallisman> it also might not be it, lol, to kwaa.. you look of the # the selector, but you don't want to do that every time?
[19:21:03] <sosman> Tallisman: doh - thanks heaps.
[19:21:09] <Tallisman> you could.. in theory, just take another selector (such as id="slide" $("#slide")
[19:21:13] <Tallisman> it worked :]?
[19:21:28] <sosman> yep :-[
[19:21:51] <sosman> I can die happy
[19:22:14] <Tallisman> ah :), me to ^^
[19:22:32] <sosman> Tallisman: can go for long ride on motorbike now ...
[19:42:44] <xsamurai> ok im a bit confused as to where to set the value , should i do oncleanup or onclosed
[19:46:42] <Tallisman> oncleanup or onclosed..
[19:46:57] <Tallisman> ehem, you might want to try jquery events :P
[19:47:10] <Tallisman> $("Selector").click(); for instance
[19:53:46] <munderwo> Hi all, im looking for suggestions on books for jquery?
[19:54:23] <munderwo> I'm a programmer, just trying to get my head around javascript and jquery, and feel like I need a bit of a filler on the core concepts...
[19:55:31] <Tallisman> uhm, I never read a book about javascript or jquery, so I won't be able to help you out :P, do you have knowledge about other languages?
[19:59:59] <Juzzy> I have a friend that's just getting into jquery
[20:00:09] <Juzzy> and i got her like 6 jquesry ebooks
[20:00:14] <Juzzy> wow... jquery too
[20:00:18] <sung> is she hot
[20:00:21] <Juzzy> ya
[20:00:26] <sung> single?
[20:00:31] <sung> sane?
[20:00:53] <sung> better q: does she live in miami?
[20:00:58] <Juzzy> married
[20:01:00] <Juzzy> :p
[20:01:14] <Tallisman> lol, sung got a little overhead
[20:01:14] <sung> i met an attractive girl in miami who claimed to know js/jquery
[20:01:34] <sung> i still don't believe her.
[20:01:35] <Tallisman> she might be a designer knowing a little bit of jquery
[20:01:46] <Tallisman> designers generally know a bit about it.
[20:01:53] <munderwo> yeah, I've programmed in python, c/c++, little bit of java...
[20:02:50] <munderwo> sung: why dont you believe that she could program? do you think that women have an inbuilt inability to program?
[20:03:02] <Tallisman> well, look into the jquery event system, selector system. That will get you started, if, for, while also works, but that won't give you trouble.
[20:03:04] <xsamurai> does it really matter what an attractive girls knows or doesnt it
[20:03:39] <Tallisman> well, munderwo, I am a student of a programming sector of a designer school
[20:03:51] <Tallisman> my sector has 90 web and game developers
[20:04:04] <sung> munderwo: negative
[20:04:04] <Tallisman> how much women do you think my sector has?
[20:04:29] <sung> munderwo: i think that she's a pathological liar due to unrelated incidents
[20:04:40] <sung> and lies about everything
[20:06:23] <munderwo> Probably about 6%. thats the normal number... And one of the reasons is that there is an attitude in some (and note I said some) that women cant program, and any woman that can is lying or copied of someone else.. I just find that offensive... and I just like to point out that... sung: well if she lied about a lot of other things that is a different story, and im sorry if I jumped down your throat..
[20:06:35] <Tallisman> 0% :p
[20:06:58] <Tallisman> 90 programmers and 0 females :)
[20:07:45] <xsamurai> i've met about 5 super hot female programmers in my life
[20:08:06] <Tallisman> then again, we are developers, interested in code, not the design of the website. we also have other sectors, Game design, Interactive design, graphical design..
[20:08:42] <Tallisman> Interactive design is generally spoken webdesign, jquery, javascript, little bit of php, 25% female (I think)
[20:08:54] <Tallisman> that does not mean they like it though :P
[20:09:12] <munderwo> well... I used to work in mainframes... and it was a little bit more that that.. the computer industry has a problem that It is only drawing from half the population... this is a problem for all types of reasons... its also attitudes like xsamurai just expressed that makes women not want to get into programming
[20:09:50] <Tallisman> yea :P
[20:10:18] <Tallisman> I do not have the opinion they cannot program, they can, they just don't want to :)
[20:12:09] <Tallisman> welcome back necromancer :)
[20:12:33] <munderwo> Tallisman: yes I agree. there are a lot of women who dont want to program, just like there are a lot of men who dont like to program.. the problem is that ontop of this there are quite a lot of disincentives for women to program, not least of which is they dont hardly ever get exposed to what programming is... and that its often a big boys club... But i think we are reading from the same book. The lack of women represented in programming c
[20:12:34] <munderwo> is just one of my pet rants... soz if I overdid it... just get a little angry about it.

[20:57:24] <kerigan> hi guys, when I'm doing: <div style="background-color:#660000;"><span></span><span></span></div>, the spans inside the div should have the background color right?
[20:58:55] <K1ng`> why not try it
[20:58:57] <K1ng`> ?
[20:59:05] <etcetera> is it possible to get jquery to use scss variables?
[20:59:37] <kerigan> Im trying it
[20:59:59] <kerigan> and its not using the bg color which is weird
[21:02:20] <Phelms215> @kerigan what kind of content do you have in the div?
[21:02:26] <Phelms215> other than the 2 empty spans
[21:02:41] <kerigan> nothing really
[21:02:47] <kerigan> theres text in the spans
[21:03:40] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/SthPp/ it works just the code - can you update it with the rest of your code
[21:03:44] <Phelms215> & i'll take a look
[21:05:36] <kerigan> oh found my error,  had too float:left on my last span
[21:06:47] <Phelms215> ah makes sense
[21:15:22] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[21:15:42] <Phelms215> hey
[21:16:46] <devinrolsen> hi
[21:17:07] <ch3mical> zpoley: thanks... forgot I even asked, was so wrapped up in coding lol
[21:18:17] <zpoley> ch3mical: haha nice
[21:19:01] <Phelms215> lucky your not in a comcast chat they would have booted you
[21:19:28] <kerigan> man doing html,js,css for the first time in years, after only doing, c, objc & java, is sure weird
[21:20:01] <Phelms215> @kerigan - I hate going the other way more haha
[21:21:34] <hillct> Good evening all. I have the following code http://pastebin.com/73nT8bYp and I'm trying to return the array (in this case only ever one matching object) but it seems I'm using JQuery.grep incorrectly. I wonder if you could provide some guidance on the proper syntax. Thanks.
[21:22:54] <hillct> The indicated code loops throuh all cuepoints, in the array, including the matching cuepoint, but returns an empty array
[21:24:10] <hillct> so my question, is how should I be constructing the test and return, to get the result array to contain the cuepoint (cp) object containing the matching cpid ?
[21:27:07] <ch3mical> Can someone look at this and help me figure out why my dialog is getting screwed up? http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/
[21:27:15] <ch3mical> I'm leaning towards "bug" here
[21:27:50] <ch3mical> If I try to center the dialog (per the docs) it makes it do funky things when you resize the window
[21:28:08] <ch3mical> If you don't specify the position options it doesn't do it
[21:28:58] <ch3mical> The reason I'm trying to use the position options is to set a specific top value, but I don't want to position the x axis, I want that centered still
[21:30:49] <ch3mical> Oh, woops, I put the static value on x axis instead of y axis, but either way it's doing wierd shit
[21:31:22] <Phelms215> define wierd?
[21:31:35] <Tallisman> I fail to see what it is doing wrong..
[21:32:01] <ch3mical> It doesn't stay centered
[21:32:08] <ch3mical> It just stretches
[21:32:12] <Tallisman> it kinda does.. both
[21:32:26] <Tallisman> oh, I see :P
[21:32:43] <ch3mical> Yeah remove the width value, it's clearer
[21:33:38] <ch3mical> I dunno, maybe the position value isn't meant to be dynamic on document size changes
[21:33:44] <ch3mical> I just kind of assumed it would be
[21:34:00] <Phelms215> i had this problem once h.o
[21:34:04] <Phelms215> let me look at my code
[21:34:51] <Tallisman> the document position value isn't meant to be dynamic indeed
[21:34:54] <Tallisman> look at this:
[21:35:08] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/1/
[21:35:11] <ch3mical> You mean the dialog position value?
[21:35:21] <Tallisman> yes
[21:35:46] <Tallisman> it is perfectly centered, until you resize.
[21:35:48] <kwaa> http://pastebin.com/xgmr66Qa
[21:35:51] <ch3mical> Yeah, that's exactly what I was talking about. in your example. Sorry, my example was less clear
[21:36:23] <kwaa> My code works with 1.5.2 but not with 1.6.1 -- http://pastebin.com/xgmr66Qa -- Is it the attr?
[21:36:25] <Phelms215> just put position: 'center',
[21:36:34] <ch3mical> Phelms215: same result
[21:37:01] <Tallisman> yea :P
[21:37:02] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/dT3jh/2/
[21:37:04] <Phelms215> it wont live update if you wanted that you would have to make it draggable and monitor it I would imagine
[21:37:13] <Tallisman> hmm
[21:37:24] <ch3mical> I want it to not be draggable, though
[21:37:44] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/3/
[21:37:55] <ch3mical> This is going to be for a login dialog, so I kind of want it to obstruct the page until I get a valid login
[21:38:06] <Phelms215> what i would do
[21:38:12] <kwaa> My code works with 1.5.2 but not with 1.6.1 -- http://pastebin.com/xgmr66Qa -- Is it the attr?
[21:38:15] <kwaa> ^^
[21:38:41] <ch3mical> Phelms215: http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/3/ doesn't stay centered on resize for me, or are you trying to demonstrate something else?
[21:38:42] <Phelms215> is monitor the page for a resize window and manually adjust the objects position
[21:39:12] <Phelms215> give me 2 seconds nd i'll show you an example
[21:39:38] <ch3mical> Phelms215: yeah, I could do that, I was just hoping the position value would work like a css alignment (automatic)
[21:40:11] <Tallisman> ch3mical, the dialog is being created only once at a specified position. if you want to have it move on resize you probably have to set the position agian
[21:40:13] <Tallisman> at resize.
[21:40:46] <ch3mical> Right, I just was hoping the position: center option would just set "text-align:center" on the dialog container
[21:40:54] <ch3mical> Seems so easy
[21:41:33] <kwaa> My code works with 1.5.2 but not with 1.6.1 -- http://pastebin.com/xgmr66Qa -- Is it the attr?
[21:41:37] <kwaa> :)))
[21:41:37] <ch3mical> I guess I could just do $('#dialog').parent().css('text-align','center'); or something... maybe that will work
[21:42:10] <Phelms215> I got it 1 second
[21:42:12] <Phelms215> cleaning it up
[21:42:17] <Tallisman> I don't think so :P, anyhoe.. I just crashed ff.
[21:43:18] <Phelms215> http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/5/
[21:43:29] <Phelms215> it monitors for window resize and updates position
[21:43:49] <Tallisman> bug =)
[21:44:19] <Tallisman> I don't think that is your fault though..
[21:45:05] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/6/ <-- fixed versiomn
[21:45:44] <Tallisman> the window object is kinda.. weird.. anyhoe, it made your solution also update the height (at least in chrome) try it :P
[21:46:27] <Tallisman> ill check in ff, moment
[21:46:34] <Phelms215> it works in ff
[21:46:36] <Phelms215> what bout ie
[21:46:38] <ch3mical> It doesn't look any different (http://jsfiddle.net/dT3jh/6/) then the original problem
[21:46:41] <ch3mical> In chrome
[21:47:29] <Tallisman> try in firefox :P
[21:47:49] <Tallisman> i confused the 2, but in firefox there will be a difference ;P
[21:48:41] <Phelms215> wait.. in FF document resize isnt working
[21:48:44] <Phelms215> only window?
[21:48:47] <ch3mical> I need it to work in all browsers, though... question, do either of you know if there is a style in the UI css that sets the dialog container as position:fixed or something?
[21:49:15] <Tallisman> in ff window resize is being flawed by 10px :P
[21:49:43] <lrvick> any idea why my jquery-ui dialog youtube videos are not autoplaying? Click a vdieo in the video box here to see my setup: http://alpha.tawlk.com/#android
[21:49:45] <Tallisman> when changing the direction of the resize the dialog shifted 10px up and 10px left
[21:49:53] <lrvick> They also are not filling the dialog box
[21:49:59] <lrvick> I tried percentage 100% but no avail
[21:50:52] <ch3mical> .ui-dialog¬†{¬†position:¬†absolute;¬†padding:¬†.2em;¬†width:¬†300px;¬†overflow:¬†hidden;¬†}
[21:51:15] <ch3mical> Would that affect a text-align:center ?
[21:51:50] <ch3mical> The absolute position, I mean
[21:51:53] <Tallisman> have you tryed a fixed value Lrvick?
[21:52:17] <Phelms215> yeah you cant position and center
[21:52:27] <Tallisman> I don't think you can text-align: center; on an absolute div
[21:52:45] <Phelms215> wait
[21:52:58] <lrvick> Tallisman: it is fixed now, to the same width as the dialog
[21:53:02] <lrvick> no pony
[21:53:21] <Tallisman> :p
[21:53:30] <ch3mical> I can't seem to override the position value by setting it with a .css() function
[21:54:26] <Tallisman> hmm, I actually have thesame bug on one of my projects.. But i blame it on the textarea.. which it is in my case xD
[21:54:39] <ch3mical> Oh, but then if it's not absolute it's doing to knock all my page elements around
[21:54:42] <ch3mical> Bleh
[21:55:01] <Tallisman> margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
[21:55:07] <ch3mical> Guess I can't solve it with css
[21:55:12] <Tallisman> ^
[21:56:15] <Tallisman> In sovjet russia, CSS solves you :p
[21:56:39] <Phelms215> apparently window.resize() updates multiple times as you drag rather than once your done dragging
[21:56:44] <ch3mical> lol
[21:56:46] <Phelms215> thats why i think the issue is happening
[21:56:49] <coldhead> K1ng`: you get your line fixed?
[21:56:51] <lrvick> ok auoplay works. so my 2 issues remain. A: The audio from a playing video continues to play after i close the dialog.. which tells me the element has not in fact been destroyed. The second and homfully easier, is that the video does not fill the dialog box... dispite explicitly setting the iframe width.
[21:57:29] <Tallisman> your website freaks me out btw lrvick xD
[21:57:36] <Tallisman> it's so hyperactive lol
[21:57:50] <wahnf> hi
[21:57:57] <lrvick> Tallisman: its a popular topic
[21:58:00] <lrvick> Tallisman: lol
[21:58:05] <Tallisman> :]
[21:58:46] <lrvick> Tallisman: put in a less popular topic liiike... http://alpha.tawlk.com/?#dog%20grooming
[21:58:48] <lrvick> ;-)
[21:58:59] <wahnf> is there a way to run some code when someone provides a callback for an event on a jQuery UI widget? this happens after the widget has already been instantiated
[21:59:11] <lrvick> also it appears my buzz profile_icons are broken
[21:59:14] * lrvick makes note to fix
[21:59:43] <Tallisman> lrvick.. why is dog grooming still hyperactive O.o
[22:00:02] <lrvick> it shouldnt be. after a couple secons of loading updates
[22:00:03] <Tallisman> disturbing xD
[22:00:15] <lrvick> but yeah, theres a lot of data out there
[22:00:50] <Tallisman> but okey, you have a problem with width
[22:00:59] <ch3mical> I think I'll just go back to a statically positioned dialog. lol. I didn't want to spend this much time messing with that. ;p
[22:01:00] <hillct> This is pissing me off now, as it should be so damn trivial. Why Can't I get cuePoint ID 12 out of $.grep? http://jsfiddle.net/M9PRB/
[22:01:28] <hillct> nothing more annoying than wasteing an hour on something so stupid
[22:01:31] <K1ng`> coldhead, yep. thanks :p
[22:01:32] <Tallisman> I've had useless problems which took weeks to solve @ch3mical :P
[22:01:49] <ch3mical> lol
[22:02:09] <ch3mical> Well I definitely can't spend THAT much time on it lol
[22:02:34] <Tallisman> also puts me into perspective.. why do I spend THAT much time on it XD
[22:02:41] <Assimilater> well i was going to make a jsfiddle to show you guys the problem i'm having but i can't even get it to work... http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/BtSPa/
[22:02:46] <ch3mical> heh
[22:03:06] <Assimilater> it still kind of shows you the problem
[22:03:17] <Assimilater> i'm trying to get a left and right button on the same line as a jquery ui slider
[22:03:32] <ch3mical> mmm floating divs
[22:05:37] <Assimilater> ok i got an update that works HOORAY
[22:05:40] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/BtSPa/1/
[22:06:16] <Assimilater> or rather shows you what the problem is
[22:07:35] <Assimilater> so i can make it smaller with adding a width attribute
[22:07:36] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/BtSPa/2/
[22:07:43] <Tallisman> hmm, it doesn't quite slide..
[22:07:45] <Assimilater> but i can't appear to make it get on the same line as anything else
[22:07:48] <Assimilater> and it doesn't slide
[22:07:49] <Assimilater> ya
[22:08:45] <Assimilater> there's a third update now
[22:08:50] <Tallisman> the problem is getReport
[22:08:58] <Tallisman> are you sure it exists?
[22:09:02] <Assimilater> the fact it's undefined atm?
[22:09:12] <Tallisman> kinda..
[22:09:21] <Assimilater> that would explain the not sliding part
[22:09:29] <Assimilater> i was more focused on why it insists on taking up it's own line
[22:09:30] <Assimilater> haha
[22:09:31] <Tallisman> it kinda is the reason of the not sliding :P
[22:09:34] <Tallisman> lol
[22:10:36] <Assimilater> 4'th update i put a stub function so it will slide for your pleasure
[22:10:47] <Assimilater> it still insists on taking up its own line
[22:11:05] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/BtSPa/6/
[22:11:31] <Tallisman> if i had a slider.. that's pretty much what i'd want :P
[22:12:01] <Phelms215> is there a way to just replace the content in a div ? like appendTo only replace
[22:12:02] <Assimilater> well i'm using the slider for an ajax query
[22:12:03] <ch3mical> Phelms215 & Tallisman, thanks for the help, btw :P
[22:12:11] <Assimilater> but that's another matter
[22:12:16] <Assimilater> i'd prefer you'd accept my stub :P
[22:12:17] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/BtSPa/7/
[22:12:33] <Phelms215> @ch3mical sorry couldnt get it working fully m8
[22:12:37] <Assimilater> i'm still trying to style it properly
[22:12:58] <ch3mical> No worries, it wasn't that important anyway
[22:13:32] <Tallisman> so how do you want it assimilater? :P
[22:13:39] <Assimilater> i'd like it all on one line
[22:13:42] <Assimilater> the search bar
[22:13:43] <Assimilater> the back button
[22:13:45] <Assimilater> the slider
[22:13:45] <Tallisman> ah, i see
[22:13:46] <Assimilater> the forward button
[22:14:30] <Assimilater> (ugly issues aside i'll put margins on everything eventually just want to not take up any vertical space, because this is going to show reports :P )
[22:14:37] <kwaa> Please, I really need someone to figure this out for me ^^
[22:15:09] <kwaa> Works for 1.5.2 but not 1.61 :  http://pastebin.com/xgmr66Qa
[22:16:13] <Assimilater> probably the .attr
[22:16:28] <Assimilater> as i'm aware one of the big updates in 1.6 was the use of .attr and .val
[22:16:30] <kwaa> Yeah... replacing it with prop disnt work
[22:16:42] <kwaa> *didn't
[22:16:46] <Assimilater> and prop...
[22:17:00] <kwaa> Any clue?
[22:17:47] <Tallisman> Assimilater.. I know floating it all is a way to fix your bug.. that for one..
[22:17:52] <Tallisman> however.. I hate floats.
[22:18:00] <Tallisman> so i'm not going to do that.
[22:18:48] <Assimilater> i'm with you on hating the idea of 'floating it all'
[22:19:16] <Assimilater> i use floats because i want something on the right or left without altering the text alignment
[22:19:22] <Assimilater> not because i want to get something on the same line
[22:19:56] <Assimilater> kwaa: so what exactly is the problem?
[22:20:06] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/BtSPa/8/
[22:20:15] <Tallisman> and that should give you all you need.
[22:20:40] <kwaa> Assimilater: Go to http://imkwaa.com/
[22:20:53] <kwaa> And click the link "graphical" under the slider.
[22:21:12] <Assimilater> aha!
[22:21:13] <kwaa> What it does it hides the first slider and replaces it with another slider.
[22:21:15] <Assimilater> ty Tallisman
[22:21:20] <Tallisman> that derp design thingy creeps me out hahahaha :P
[22:21:32] <kwaa> The orange thing?
[22:21:55] <kwaa> Haha, I thought it was cute. Looks like it's pushing/pulling the page as you navigate in the menu.
[22:22:27] <Tallisman> that's one way of looking at it :P
[22:22:31] <kwaa> ^^
[22:22:40] <ch3mical> Hmmm dialogClass doesn't seem to do anything, nor do I see any doc as to what options it will take other than "alert"
[22:22:55] <Tallisman> sooo.. what exactly is the problem kwaa? :P
[22:23:08] <Tallisman> your slider pretty much works ^^
[22:23:30] <kwaa> Yes, and if you press "graphical" below the slider, it still works.
[22:23:36] <kwaa> Thanks to me using 1.5.2
[22:23:46] <kwaa> Look now in 15 sec when I go 1.6.1
[22:23:47] <Tallisman> lol, you downgraded ^^?
[22:24:17] <kwaa> That snippet of code I posted wont work in 1.6.1
[22:24:20] <Tallisman> okey, you can upgrade now ^^
[22:24:22] <kwaa> So I had t√¥ ^^
[22:24:32] <kwaa> Yeah, I have. Im on 1.6.1 now.
[22:24:38] <Tallisman> okey
[22:24:58] <Tallisman> it stopped sliding and.. crashed..
[22:25:13] <Assimilater> so the main issue being the center image isn't displaying?
[22:25:38] <Assimilater> and the slider is jaggedy?
[22:25:41] <kwaa> http://pastebin.com/EK5pNnui
[22:26:02] <kwaa> Nah, it dosn't show up when switching slider to graphical.
[22:26:42] <kwaa> So I guess something is wrong here:  $( $(e.target).attr('href') ).show().siblings(".slider").hide();
[22:26:50] <kwaa> Because it never does show()
[22:27:02] <Tallisman> :P
[22:27:08] <Assimilater> and target will be what in this case?
[22:27:12] <Tallisman> in ff it is also broken btw..
[22:27:14] <Tallisman> your slider
[22:27:18] <Tallisman> in 16.1
[22:27:37] <kwaa> Yeah, works 1.5.2 all over, and 1.6.1 not anywhere.
[22:27:51] <kwaa> Assimilater: My slider
[22:28:04] <Phelms215> test
[22:28:06] <Assimilater> the h1?
[22:28:17] <ch3mical> Phelms215: it worked
[22:28:35] <kwaa> Assimilater: The <div class="slider" id="graphical-slider">
[22:28:50] <Assimilater> bah, time to use firebug's console, haha
[22:28:56] <kwaa> ^^
[22:29:04] <Phelms215> my proxy server shit the bucket for a second I believe
[22:29:05] <Phelms215> lol
[22:29:19] <ch3mical> Tor?
[22:29:32] <kwaa> I can't use Chromes developer exention, because the jquery effect adds hundreds of divs...
[22:30:28] <Tallisman> As of jQuery 1.6, the .attr() method returns undefined for attributes that have not been set. In addition, .attr() should not be used on plain objects, arrays, the window, or the document. To retrieve and change DOM properties, use the .prop() method.
[22:30:41] <ch3mical> kwaa: why should that matter? o_O
[22:31:04] <Tallisman> sooo.. change attr with prop ^^
[22:31:09] <kwaa> ch3mical: Doesn't, I'm just bitching :)
[22:31:25] <kwaa> Tallisman: Tried it, didnt work. Unless I have to change some other attribute aswell?
[22:31:26] <ch3mical> kwaa: heh -_-
[22:32:17] <ch3mical> kwaa: explain to me why you are using $(e.target).attr('href') and not just $(this) ?
[22:32:48] <Tallisman> that's also a good one..
[22:33:08] <Assimilater> i g2g
[22:33:10] <Assimilater> g'night
[22:33:15] <Assimilater> thanks again Tallisman
[22:33:20] <Tallisman> g'night Assimilater, np :P
[22:33:21] <Assimilater> gl kwaa
[22:33:25] <kwaa> Good night
[22:33:50] <Tallisman> $(this). might help you out kwaa :}
[22:34:02] <kwaa> ch3mical: I didn't write the code, someone here helped me earlier ^^
[22:34:09] <kwaa> Let me try :)
[22:34:42] <Tallisman> I'm pretty certain.. lol
[22:34:47] <kwaa> Hm..
[22:34:52] <kwaa> Nuu...
[22:35:40] <kwaa>  $(this).attr('href') ).show().siblings(".slider").hide();
[22:35:44] <kwaa> Didnt work...
[22:35:49] <Tallisman> $(this).show().siblings(".slider").hide();?
[22:36:55] <kwaa> I changed, but it dosn't do anything right now
[22:37:01] <Tallisman> hmm
[22:38:49] <Phelms215> what about  $(this).show(); $(this).find('.slider').hide();
[22:39:08] <Tallisman> that will hide all phelms
[22:39:33] <kwaa> It didn't do anything actually...
[22:39:41] <Tallisman> but replace $(".slider:not(:first)").hide(); with $(this).find(".slider").hide();
[22:40:00] <ch3mical> kwaa: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/KTCyY/ it doesn't work in 1.5.2 either
[22:40:03] <Tallisman> that will initialy invisibilize everything
[22:40:12] <ch3mical> I might have not recreated it exactly right
[22:40:30] <Tallisman> and then make it show with $(this).show();
[22:40:48] <kwaa> http://imkwaa.com/js/derp.js
[22:43:48] <kwaa> Any more ideas, or did I miss something?
[22:44:02] <kwaa> Tallisman: I don't really know... where to put it.
[22:44:49] <Tallisman> $(document).ready(function() { $(".slider:not(:first)").hide(); $(".chose a").click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $(".slider").hide(); $(this).show(); }); });
[22:45:00] <Tallisman> damn that took a while to write.. xD
[22:45:15] <kwaa> Hah ^^
[22:45:19] <Tallisman> it might work, or it won't lol
[22:45:30] <kwaa> Updated and uploaded it
[22:45:51] <Tallisman> ah, at least it does something again
[22:46:24] <kwaa> So now it does everything but to show?
[22:46:26] <Tallisman> $(this). might not work indeed..
[22:46:32] <Tallisman> FACEPALM
[22:46:51] <Tallisman> well, actually it does work..
[22:47:13] <Tallisman> I'll show you, change $(this).show(); to $(this).hide();
[22:47:16] <Tallisman> lol :]
[22:47:45] <kwaa> Done
[22:48:04] <kwaa> It hides the links ^^
[22:48:23] <Tallisman> yep
[22:48:48] <Tallisman> okey..
[22:50:51] <Tallisman> so the sliders also have the hash code value
[22:50:54] <Tallisman> ?
[22:51:19] <Tallisman> id, okey
[22:51:28] <kwaa> #? Yeah, the links has the same as the sliders id
[22:52:30] <Tallisman> okey
[22:53:34] <Tallisman> $(".slider"+window.location.hash).show();
[22:55:27] <Tallisman> only problem now is when a nutcase edits the hashes.. lol
[22:55:45] <Tallisman> nah
[22:55:52] <kwaa> Updated
[22:56:35] <Tallisman> what in the seven seas XD
[22:57:46] <kwaa> Heheh
[22:58:57] <Tallisman> this is a little hard to explain :P
[22:59:44] <parham> Hi there. I have a json question. Is it possible to define a depth/level for parsing json strings (for example, to parse only the first level, or parse arrays for attribute values, etc)?
[23:01:10] <kwaa> Tallisman: I get that ^^
[23:01:17] <ch3mical> kwaa: ... still working on that?
[23:01:29] <Tallisman> ch3mical :P
[23:01:39] <Tallisman> $(this) wasn't quite what he needed.
[23:01:44] <ch3mical> I think the simplest solution would be to use .data() ... like so: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/KTCyY/2/
[23:01:47] <kwaa> ch3mical: Trying out Tallismans ideas.. I dont really know anything ^^
[23:02:07] <Tallisman> thanks ch3mical :P
[23:02:10] <ch3mical> Works using $(this), too
[23:02:24] <ch3mical> So you don't have to use that ugly $(e.target) :P
[23:02:49] <Tallisman> $(this) == the link you clicked on.
[23:02:54] <ch3mical> Exactly
[23:03:01] <Tallisman> true
[23:03:20] <Tallisman> I didn't know about data() actually
[23:03:23] <ch3mical> So my examples stores the div ID's on the anchors
[23:03:28] <Tallisman> anyhow, this is pretty much the solution.
[23:03:31] <kwaa> Sorry, but it actually didn't work for me..
[23:03:39] <ch3mical> And pulls that to switch the div visibility
[23:04:08] <Tallisman> hmm
[23:04:21] <ch3mical> What is your site address again?
[23:04:33] <kwaa> imkwaa.com
[23:04:34] <ch3mical> Make sure it's on 1.6.1
[23:04:38] <kwaa> It is now
[23:04:48] <ch3mical> k
[23:04:49] <Tallisman> you might wanna make sure you edit the div id
[23:04:51] <ch3mical> One sec
[23:04:55] <Tallisman> in the data()..
[23:05:03] <kwaa> Tallisman: Like the "logo" effect when clicking the links now btw? ^^
[23:05:09] <ch3mical> Yeah, make sure you edit the code appropriately lol
[23:05:24] <kwaa> Tallisman: and the .js is http://imkwaa.com/js/derp.js
[23:05:39] <Tallisman> hahahaha, alot better :)
[23:05:46] <kwaa> ch3mical: and the .js is http://imkwaa.com/js/derp.js
[23:05:50] <kwaa> Heh
[23:05:56] <GoSox> derp
[23:07:08] <Tallisman> $(this).data('div_id') <-- might wanna edit that on ^^
[23:07:43] <kwaa> How so?
[23:07:55] <Tallisman> div_id doesn't quite exist in your context
[23:08:05] <GoSox> So I found this library called 'scroll' that will automatically slide an object down after you scroll the page. So you can keep an ad visible as the user reads down an article. But this one moved the ad after you stop scrolling. Are there any jquery libraries that let you scroll that ad in 'real time'?
[23:08:10] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/KTCyY/3/  @kwaa
[23:08:22] <Tallisman> euhm
[23:08:44] <Tallisman> yep, does the trick
[23:08:46] <Tallisman> however..
[23:08:56] <Tallisman> moment.. have to check something
[23:09:02] <kwaa> I feel dumb saying this, but it didnt work either.
[23:09:03] <ch3mical> GoSox: why not just use position:fixed ? o_O
[23:09:04] <kwaa> What the..
[23:09:21] <GoSox> because that's not exactly what it's doing
[23:09:41] <GoSox> here is an example. scroll down and see how the ad bounced back in view: http://www.johnmasone.com/article.php?id=237
[23:10:04] <ch3mical> I don't care what the lib you're using is doing, I'm asking you why not used position:fixed instead of the lib?
[23:10:05] <kwaa> Now I can toogle "web-slider" by taking turns clicking the two links.
[23:10:37] <ch3mical> kwaa:  what do you mean?
[23:10:56] <GoSox> because that wouldn't position the item where i want it.
[23:11:13] <kwaa> If I press "web" it hides, and if I press "graphical" it shows.
[23:11:25] <ch3mical> GoSox: yes it would, you have to use positioning styles, like left, top, right, bottom
[23:11:53] <ch3mical> kwaa: you mean the wrong slider shows when you click the web?
[23:11:56] <GoSox> i'm not trying to fix the ad to the screen
[23:12:07] <ch3mical> kwaa: Just reverse the order in the array
[23:12:20] <ch3mical> GoSox: have you ever used position:fixed ?? lol
[23:12:39] <GoSox> i want it to scroll normally until the top of the ad hits the top of the screen, then stop scrolling as you scroll the page. which is how it works now, except it does it with a delay
[23:13:07] <kwaa> ch3mical: I did, but it never shows "graphical-slider"
[23:13:35] <ch3mical> ok, then just check it's position on scroll and add position:fixed when top is less than 0?
[23:13:44] <ch3mical> I dunno, whatever
[23:13:49] <ch3mical> kwaa: lemme look
[23:14:27] <ch3mical> kwaa: did you add that code to your page?
[23:14:43] <kwaa> Yes
[23:15:22] <ch3mical> Something is lagging the shit out of my browser
[23:15:23] <kwaa> I have it in script tags in the head now
[23:16:19] <ch3mical> Anyway you can slow down the transition delay while we look at it? lol
[23:16:55] <ch3mical> kwaa: you have to comment out your code, too
[23:17:26] <kwaa> ch3mical: My previous code? Yeah, I removed it.
[23:17:36] <ch3mical> oh ok
[23:21:37] <Tallisman> well, I did it :)
[23:21:41] <ch3mical> Can you try switching to 1.6 ?
[23:21:42] <Tallisman> after alot of thinking.
[23:21:44] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/KTCyY/4/
[23:22:11] <kwaa> ch3mical: Ok
[23:23:01] <ch3mical> Tallisman: how is that different from his original code? I must be missing something
[23:23:14] <Tallisman> there are some differences :)
[23:23:20] <ch3mical> Other than using $(this)
[23:23:26] <Tallisman> no.
[23:23:29] <Tallisman> but it works ^^
[23:23:41] <ch3mical> So what is different?
[23:23:58] <kwaa> Didnt work in 1.6 or 1.6.1, it still always hidd "graphical-slider"
[23:24:00] <Tallisman> pretty much nothing :), but it works, in 1.6
[23:24:14] <Tallisman> hmm, it does work in jsfiddle
[23:24:15] <kwaa> Hm, let me give it another try.
[23:24:26] <ch3mical> I think the culprit isn't jquery
[23:24:45] <ch3mical> Seems like something else is causing his slider to disappear
[23:24:45] <Tallisman> if it isn't jquery we will know soon ^^
[23:24:52] <kwaa> Check the site now, that's the result.
[23:25:54] <Tallisman> okey..
[23:26:02] <Tallisman> then it is another problem :P
[23:26:11] <ch3mical> Yep
[23:26:23] <Tallisman> and then.. what the heck can do that :P
[23:26:24] <ch3mical> Maybe your slider.js isn't compatible with 1.6
[23:26:41] <kwaa> It is
[23:26:45] <ch3mical> Or whatever is displaying the graphical view
[23:26:49] * Tallisman moves into slider.js
[23:26:59] * ch3mical slides into mover.js
[23:27:07] <ch3mical> Oops, wrong one
[23:27:13] <kwaa> I know it is, the slider works in 1.6.1
[23:27:18] <coldhead> lol
[23:27:37] <Tallisman> :]
[23:27:41] <kwaa> It's the hide n seek that doesn't work in >1.5.2
[23:29:23] <ch3mical> kwaa: go to the console and type: $('.slider').toggle();
[23:29:52] <ch3mical> Refresh the page first, just to be safe
[23:30:11] * Tallisman does epic face palm.
[23:30:19] <ch3mical> Your problem is not the visibility of the elements
[23:30:26] <ch3mical> One of them is just ... missing?
[23:30:30] <ch3mical> The graphical one
[23:30:42] <kwaa> Yeah
[23:30:49] <ch3mical> That is to say it's not jquery doing it
[23:31:01] <kwaa> $(".slider:not(:first)").hide();
[23:31:09] <kwaa> That hides it, correct?
[23:31:16] <Tallisman> yea, as in display: none
[23:31:20] <ch3mical> Right
[23:31:47] <ch3mical> If you do $('.slider').toggle(); it should hide the visible one and show the hidden one
[23:32:04] <ch3mical> Which it DOES, but then something is not there in the graphical one
[23:32:12] <kwaa> In the consol? I dont run this in a consol..
[23:32:18] <kwaa> Just in scripttags?
[23:32:23] <ch3mical> No no no
[23:32:33] <ch3mical> Go to your page, and open the debugging console
[23:32:35] <Tallisman> you can edit javascript on the fly :P
[23:32:44] <ch3mical> and input that command in the console
[23:32:49] <Tallisman> go to the chrome debugger or something..
[23:32:51] <ch3mical> It's for debugging purpose only
[23:32:53] <abstrusenick> ?
[23:32:56] <kwaa> Ah ok
[23:33:02] <abstrusenick> sorry
[23:33:09] <ch3mical> abstrusenick: don't let it happen again
[23:33:12] <ch3mical> abstrusenick: kthx
[23:33:21] <ch3mical> Some people, sheesh
[23:33:53] <kwaa> I did it, and I dont either.
[23:34:05] <abstrusenick> is it possible to inject parameters from ajax beforeSend callback?
[23:34:10] <ch3mical> kwaa: I think the problem might be that all the images in graphical-slider are display:none
[23:34:43] <kwaa> They are display:none; in the other slider aswell
[23:35:09] <abstrusenick> setting it with xhr.data didn't work
[23:35:28] <kwaa> Hey
[23:35:42] <kwaa> ch3mical, Tallisman: You can see both now. imkwaa.com
[23:36:14] <Tallisman> It is cool alright, but a little overkill, don't ya think? xD
[23:36:23] <Tallisman> sarcasm yay*
[23:36:31] <kwaa> ^^
[23:37:25] <ch3mical> ok, kwaa, do this on your script: remove the $('.slider:not(:first)') statement
[23:37:50] <kwaa> My original script or the one you provided me with like 5 min ago?
[23:38:13] <ch3mical> Replace it with $('.slider:last').toggle();
[23:38:15] <Tallisman> your current
[23:38:15] <ch3mical> Yours
[23:38:38] <kwaa> My current is the one Tallisman posted previously
[23:38:51] <ch3mical> Whatever you are currently using
[23:39:01] <ch3mical> Change that
[23:39:35] <kwaa> I just did
[23:39:47] <kwaa> Didnt work, but then agian, I guess i had the wrong script
[23:40:11] <ch3mical> This is insanity
[23:40:14] <ch3mical> lol
[23:40:28] <Tallisman> You know, after watching your portfolio for several hours, I think it looks cool ^^
[23:40:40] <ch3mical> Tallisman: you're being brainwashed ;p
[23:40:52] <kwaa> It is cool.
[23:40:54] <kwaa> Infact.
[23:40:54] <kwaa> :)
[23:41:03] <ch3mical> Tallisman: that's the subliminal messages
[23:41:20] <Tallisman> lol
[23:41:22] <kwaa> It's not my whole portfolio, just some of the ones I had screen capped.
[23:41:30] <Tallisman> ajpiano, you there?
[23:42:01] <coldhead> ?glwt
[23:42:01] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[23:42:16] <Tallisman> wwat :) (was worth a try)
[23:42:28] <kwaa> Maybe I should just stick with 1.5.2? ^^
[23:42:36] <Tallisman> meh, it should work =(
[23:42:39] <ch3mical> No
[23:42:43] <ch3mical> Don't give up!
[23:42:44] <ch3mical> lol
[23:42:54] <Tallisman> coldhead, are you available :P?
[23:43:53] <ch3mical> Damn, you come on pretty strong
[23:43:53] <coldhead> you mean sexually?
[23:44:14] <coldhead> i can't let myself get hurt again
[23:44:16] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[23:44:17] <Tallisman> euhm, do you want me to mean it sexually or just professionally :]?
[23:44:19] <ch3mical> Apparently debugging gets him hot
[23:44:41] <coldhead> what are we fixing?
[23:44:42] <coldhead> don't make me scroll back
[23:44:51] <Tallisman> ah, anyhow, mister kwaa has created a webpage, imkwaa.com
[23:45:09] <ch3mical> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/KTCyY/4/ this should work here : http://imkwaa.com
[23:45:20] <Tallisman> it looks kinda cool, but there is a bug with the banner. it doesn't show and hide properly.
[23:45:53] <cattlefraud> Is there a way to fire an event when an element appears in the DOM?
[23:46:10] <Tallisman> Now, according to us, it should do the trick (at least, theoretically), but because of a magical force all around us, it doesn't.
[23:46:30] <coldhead> that sounds... hard to fix
[23:47:01] <Tallisman> kinda :P
[23:47:14] <kwaa> Note that it works perfectly in 1.5.2
[23:47:53] <cattlefraud> Why is it that new dom elements are not "seen" by javascript loaded earlier? Using .live doesn't seem to fix this either
[23:48:12] <ch3mical> cattlefraud: untrue
[23:48:13] <coldhead> i would just use 1.5.2 then
[23:48:29] <kwaa> Never give up, never surrender.
[23:48:41] <coldhead> i am still waiting for your site to load
[23:48:45] <coldhead> slow connection is slow
[23:48:55] <devinrolsen> K buzz lightyear :)
[23:49:04] <Tallisman> in sovjet russia, internet connection is you.
[23:49:56] <cattlefraud> ch3mical: With ajax too?
[23:50:26] <ch3mical> DOM is DOM. Doesn't matter how objects are inserted into it. If it's in the DOM js should be able to find it
[23:50:35] <ch3mical> Maybe it's being removed from the DOM before you check for it?
[23:50:53] <ch3mical> Or you're looking in the wrong place, is my guess
[23:51:03] <Tallisman> It might be me, but I cannot image a single ocassion where you want to bind to an element on the moment it appears..
[23:51:25] <cattlefraud> ch3mical: I can
[23:51:50] <coldhead> why is this code using $(".slider:not(:first)") instead of $(".slider:gt(0)") ?
[23:52:18] <ch3mical> coldhead: actually, I've been telling him to just use .slider:last
[23:52:24] <ch3mical> Since there's just 2
[23:52:32] <ch3mical> And he wants the second hidden
[23:52:39] <coldhead> that's even better
[23:52:45] <coldhead> unless there are ever more than 2
[23:52:48] <ch3mical> Nope
[23:52:58] <coldhead> no, these things are set in stone
[23:53:14] <cattlefraud> ch3mical:  Is it because I am using class and not an id ?
[23:53:16] <ch3mical> kwaa: have you tried putting display:none in the css for the second slider and just leave out the jquery function to hide it?
[23:53:20] <Tallisman> visits the oldest programmers of all *egyptians*
[23:53:24] <ch3mical> cattlefraud: probably
[23:53:40] <kwaa> ch3mical: I will try that now
[23:53:44] <cattlefraud> ch3mical:  Yeah, that is a bad habit anyway
[23:54:13] <kwaa> ch3mical: And.. no.
[23:54:37] <cattlefraud> ch3mical: the .live function is really slow right?
[23:55:22] <ch3mical> *shrug*
[23:55:33] <cattlefraud> aight then
[23:56:08] <ch3mical> kwaa: why am I still seeing the second slider appear before it gets hidden by jquery?
[23:56:40] <kwaa> <div class="slider" id="graphical-slider" style="display:none;">
[23:56:42] <kwaa> You shouldnt
[23:56:53] <ch3mical> Well I do
[23:56:55] <ch3mical> Did you save?
[23:57:21] <kwaa> Yes
[23:57:32] <ch3mical> Oh, you did that on the wrong thing
[23:57:36] <ch3mical> That's why
[23:58:10] <kwaa> You want me to hide web-slider?
[23:58:22] * Tallisman has lolz with the imkwaa navigation xD, spam clicking really funifies the website :P
[23:58:30] <ch3mical> Well, maybe you just changed the text
[23:59:05] <kwaa> ch3mical: Ok, it's not the sliders fault. I hidd the first one, that worked earlier, and now only the graphic one works.
[23:59:19] <kwaa> Tallisman: ^^
