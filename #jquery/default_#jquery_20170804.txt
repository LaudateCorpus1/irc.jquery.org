[01:19:51] <Trel> catbadger and taplar: the animation was CSS, jquery is just adding the class, and hiding a div
[03:35:49] <TheWild> hello
[03:37:14] <TheWild> I just read 'We can't allow the type property to be changed (since it causes problems in IE)'. WTF? Will we keep limiting ourselves because one browser can't handle properly something it should?
[03:39:47] <TheWild> well, the version it happened in was 1.7.2 (someone's JIRA, not system of mine) so... my bad, my bad!
[03:41:58] <Uhkis> TheWild: cross browser compatibility is kinda the point so yes we will :P
[03:44:32] <TheWild> there are two principles of website development: 1. Make your websites in a way so they work in every browser. 2. If your website doesn't work in one browser, we know what browser it is.
[03:58:13] <Kartagis> ahoy. is it normal that I first get OPTIONS node.json then POST node.json like it's supposed to be, with http://plnkr.co/edit/jzYtsShdS3fsvSm27nDk?p=preview ?
[04:50:26] <sammyg> there used to be a jquery download for visual studio with documentation syntax, is this no longer available or is part of the main download?
[04:58:51] <recursivesearch> how to recursively search through an entire html page to find one href=http
[05:16:28] <AdamPDotty> for example $('[href^=http]')
[05:35:25] <Dashers> How do I pass this into an online function?  this changes scope in the inline, and I want to pass in the calling object.
[05:38:29] <AdamPDotty> "online"
[06:06:33] <recursivesearch> $('[href^=http]') did not work
[06:08:42] <pavonia> What did you try exactly?
[06:11:11] <recursivesearch> HTML page contains a <td> which contains a <a target href = "http://...". I want to use jquery to find that href http link and print it.
[06:11:48] <recursivesearch> @pavonia
[06:13:58] <cannap> $('td').find('a').attr('href')
[06:14:02] <cannap> or something xD
[06:14:07] <cannap> td should the current td
[06:14:27] <recursivesearch> there's a ton of td in the page
[06:14:28] <pavonia> recursivesearch: Works fine https://jsfiddle.net/qfdb9wox/
[06:15:34] <recursivesearch> the page contains many td and many hrefs, how i search for a specific one. lets say the href that appears on the 10th index? href:[9]?
[06:16:41] <pavonia> The 10th on the site, the 10th in a specific container, ...?
[06:17:02] <recursivesearch> On the site.
[06:17:32] <recursivesearch> If i have 10 td on the site and I want the href that is inside the 10th td, how do i get it?
[06:20:32] <recursivesearch> Actually, my site is so huge that its pointless to count how which #th the <td> is. Is there a way to search for an https link that contains certain parameters like: "https://google.com/projects/deep/*this is the part i want to extract*"
[06:21:05] <pavonia> Something like this https://jsfiddle.net/qfdb9wox/1/
[06:21:06] <cannap> @recursivesearch, https://jsfiddle.net/7Lfu0Lp9/
[06:21:22] <cannap> ok go for pavonia
[06:21:37] <cannap> i forgot evrytime there is eq
[06:22:09] <recursivesearch> Thanks, but I realized how pointless it is. Since I dont know always know that it will be ('[href^=http]:eq(2)')
[06:22:34] <cannap> then try mine an check if a has length
[06:29:50] <recursivesearch> Its not working. https://jsfiddle.net/qfdb9wox/2/
[06:30:40] <recursivesearch> How do i alert what i found?
[06:31:33] <pavonia> https://jsfiddle.net/qfdb9wox/3/
[06:33:08] <AdamPDotty> console.log(e.href);
[06:34:33] <recursivesearch> Thanks! How can I call this function on my server.js class?
[06:34:39] <recursivesearch> And print the content?
[06:44:20] <Dashers> Well I answered my own question, you can't pass this into an inline function.  Instead you have to have a standalone function, but if you wrap a function within a function you can have shared variables and you can set this to one at the relevant point.
[06:45:05] <AdamPDotty> Fine.
[06:46:25] <recursivesearch> So I $post the href to my server.js. How do I output the e?
[06:48:30] * AdamPDotty eyes pavonia
[06:48:53] <recursivesearch> I tried doing console.log(myclass.e);
[06:55:12] <pavonia> e is an object so JSON.stringify perhaps
[09:24:11] <flobin> hi everyone, I'm trying to recreate the scrolling on this page http://archio.co.uk/project/plashet-road/ and I'm trying to understand this jquery script http://archio.co.uk/media/js/parallax2.js
[09:24:51] <flobin> on line 74 it says:   $('.display-window').html(_window.toFixed(1));
[09:24:59] <flobin> what does that .html() do?
[09:25:26] <flobin> wouldn't that replace the contents of $('.display-window') with a number?
[10:24:29] <qakhan> Hi all, i am trying to use str.replace with if/else statement. but its not working. here my code https://jsfiddle.net/gd0fswke/1/
[10:25:37] <taplar> if doesn't return a value
[10:26:06] <taplar> and you are repeating the same conditional over and over
[10:26:08] <taplar> ???
[10:26:27] <taplar> and it's 'else if', not 'elseif'
[10:26:53] <qakhan> basic goal is to replace special character with words
[10:27:12] <taplar> you should hitup ##javascript since this is vanila js code
[10:29:57] <qakhan> taplar is it doable?
[10:30:26] <taplar> sure, but it is more OT for ##javascript which is why i'm pointing you to there
[10:30:35] <taplar> *on topic
[10:31:40] <qakhan> ok thanks
[11:10:16] <Keytap> Good morning, gents
[11:10:22] <Keytap> Had a quick question.
[11:10:44] <Keytap> I'm having a bit of trouble with the selectmenu from jQueryUI.  If I give it a width of 100%, it ignores it and stretches to fit whatever text is currently being displayed
[11:10:51] <Keytap> But if I give it an absolute width, it truncates and ellipses's the text off like I would expect.
[11:11:11] <taplar> did you try min-width?
[11:11:17] <Keytap> Any idea of what could cause that, or perhaps a way to make it work in the way I expect?
[11:11:26] <Keytap> taplar: Haven't, but give me just a sec
[11:11:33] <Keytap> taplar: You mean like min-width: 100%?
[11:11:48] <Keytap> taplar: Or did you perhaps mean max-width?
[11:12:01] <taplar> no, i meant min-width
[11:12:18] <taplar> and you might want to try like 100vw
[11:12:22] <taplar> instead of 100%
[11:12:35] <Keytap> taplar: Erm...  I'm trying to make it 100% of the width of its container
[11:12:41] <taplar> ahh
[11:12:41] <Keytap> taplar: Not the page
[11:12:45] <taplar> herp derp
[11:12:52] <Keytap> taplar: No worries.
[11:13:10] <Keytap> Give me a sec and I'll make a codepen
[11:50:15] <codecutter> this prints the the elemet for all div.post, need it to only select the one that matches the 'postId', the id statement has no effect for some reason - https://pastebin.com/4hYH2tax
[11:50:38] <codecutter> if statement*
[11:50:52] <quechon> anybody here use atom ide??
[11:51:06] <codecutter> webstorm, over here
[11:51:33] <taplar> intellij and vscode
[11:51:46] <codecutter> i think he means js ide
[11:51:53] <codecutter> unless i'm kistaken
[11:51:58] <codecutter> mistaken*
[11:52:24] <taplar> codecutter what is event.currentTarget?
[11:53:52] <codecutter> tapler: document
[11:54:18] <taplar> so that's why it's finding them all
[11:55:21] <codecutter> right.
[11:55:50] <codecutter> thats why i'm using the if statement on line 2
[11:56:03] <taplar> all that does is sees if any matches
[11:56:05] <codecutter> but it has not effect
[11:56:10] <codecutter> ok
[11:56:16] <taplar> that lookup doesn't affect your second lookup.  why would it?
[11:56:17] <codecutter> i see
[11:56:55] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[11:57:01] <codecutter> whats the correct way to do it?
[11:57:17] <taplar> what's the relation to post and like icon?
[11:57:34] <codecutter> like-icon is a child of .post
[11:57:40] <randymarsh9> i'm trying to figure out how to detect a failure when using .getJSON
[11:57:51] <randymarsh9> i know how to use the success callback but is there something like that for a failure?
[11:57:53] <taplar> how do you find a child of something?
[11:58:05] <taplar> error
[11:58:19] <codecutter> each div.post has a span.like-icon
[11:58:21] <taplar> you can also reference the api for getJSON or ajax to see that stuff
[11:58:33] <taplar> but the one you are concerned about only has one codecutter
[11:58:49] <codecutter> yes
[11:59:50] <taplar> so you find the like icon inside that post contextually
[12:02:20] <taplar> comprende?
[12:02:26] <codecutter> ok
[12:02:29] <codecutter> console.log(($(event.currentTarget).find('.post').data('post-id')).find('.like-icon'));
[12:02:31] <codecutter> error
[12:02:47] <taplar> you only want the post that has a post-id that matches your variable, no?
[12:02:59] <codecutter> yes
[12:03:02] <taplar> how do you do that?
[12:03:25] <codecutter> oh, i missed that part
[12:03:28] <codecutter> :)
[12:11:30] <codecutter>  console.log($('[data-post-id='+postId+']').find('.like-icon'));
[12:11:44] <codecutter> gives me more than one
[12:12:47] <taplar> console.log($('.post').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('post-id') === postId; }).length);
[12:14:04] <codecutter> thats better :)
[12:15:55] <codecutter> not too familiar with the 'filter' function
[12:19:33] <codecutter> more than 1? console.log($('.post').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('post-id') === postId; }).find('.like-icon'));
[12:20:16] <codecutter> console.log($('.post').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('post-id') === postId; }).length); <--- correct gives 1
[12:20:28] <codecutter> correctly*
[12:22:01] <randymarsh9> hey guys it seems if your handler url in the .getJSON function is on a blocklist by an ad blocker then the function never runs
[12:22:05] <randymarsh9> is that correct?
[12:23:20] <taplar_lunch> believe that is right randymarsh9
[12:23:55] <randymarsh9> so the failure callbacks are useless in this case
[12:24:08] <taplar_lunch> codecutter: if that is right then that would seem to say your post has double like-icon elements
[12:24:24] <randymarsh9> how do people usually work around this?
[12:24:54] <randymarsh9> i know i can set a flag to false, change it to true inside the getJSON and check against that flag but that seems pretty hacky
[12:24:56] <taplar_lunch> randymarsh9: not sure.  an adblocker is kinda outside the  realm of js
[12:25:26] <taplar_lunch> which is why you see more and more sites having a banner or something telling people they have an adblocker on, or that cookies are disabled, and such
[12:25:51] <randymarsh9> how is it outside the realm of js when adblockers are so prevalent?
[12:26:01] <randymarsh9> js should have ways to deal with it
[12:26:03] <taplar_lunch> adblockers are apart of the browser
[12:26:09] <taplar_lunch> js is ran in the browser
[12:26:18] <taplar_lunch> different things
[12:27:29] <randymarsh9> ok i get that but i'm saying if something outside of javascript is preventing the javascript from running correctly then javascript should have a way to detect that so it can react accordingly
[12:27:40] <taplar_lunch> why?
[12:28:01] <randymarsh9> so in cases like this where a json doesn't run at all i can do some error handling/fallback to something else
[12:28:03] <taplar_lunch> i as a user have chosen to block a site
[12:28:03] <taplar_lunch> why should I allow you to override my concent
[12:28:17] <randymarsh9> i'm not saying the javascript is supposed to override the blocker
[12:28:24] <taplar_lunch> so what are you saying?
[12:28:37] <randymarsh9> i'm asking how to deal with json not getting run!!
[12:29:07] <taplar_lunch> are you sure it's not being ran?
[12:29:22] <randymarsh9> we just agreed that an adblocker can prevent this!!
[12:29:25] <taplar_lunch> as in it's not invoking the error callback or the fail() promise?
[12:29:39] <randymarsh9> no it's not
[12:29:50] <randymarsh9> when i have my adblocker on i don't get any feedback
[12:29:59] <randymarsh9> so it seems it doesn't run at all
[12:33:52] <taplar_lunch> testing on a vm to see if i can find anything
[12:36:08] <taplar_lunch> the fail() callback happens for me
[12:36:23] <taplar_lunch> $.ajax().fail(function(){ console.log('error'); })
[12:36:30] <taplar_lunch> it logs error when the blocker stops it
[12:36:43] <taplar_lunch> err
[12:36:55] <taplar_lunch> $.ajax().then(function(){ ...}, function(){ console.log('error'); })
[12:38:03] <taplar_lunch> doesn't show up in the network console, but the ajax does indeed run
[12:38:12] <randymarsh9> taplar_lunch: okay then i'm doing something
[12:38:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .then().catch()
[12:38:15] <randymarsh9> wrong
[12:38:23] <robertmaxrees> but what taplar_lunch posted will work, too.
[12:39:13] <randymarsh9> okay let me take another look thank you
[12:54:16] <taplar_lunch> yeah boyeeeeee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45511876/jquery-indexed-access-to-table-data
[12:54:58] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:55:21] <taplar_lunch> second one like that in a couple days
[12:55:22] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[13:00:46] <Uhkis> taplar_lunch: 404 =(
[13:00:49] <jan77> If I load some content for a div in the document ready function, does this trigger another document ready event when it's done?
[13:00:59] <taplar_lunch> Uhkis: hmm?
[13:01:09] <Uhkis> taplar_lunch: your SO link
[13:01:26] <Uhkis> jan77: no
[13:01:34] <taplar_lunch> hah!!!! i was waiting for him to delete it
[13:01:58] <Uhkis> was it same guy as before or something?
[13:02:33] <taplar_lunch> talking to me?
[13:02:38] <Uhkis> taplar_lunch: yes
[13:02:43] <taplar_lunch> nah, different guys
[13:03:02] <taplar_lunch> the first guy was doing [].join
[13:03:07] <taplar_lunch> this guy was doing $().html
[13:03:58] <Uhkis> hmm, so where's the funny?
[13:04:23] <taplar_lunch> just that they didn't understand that it was a method
[13:04:36] <Uhkis> oh, missing() :D
[13:04:40] <taplar_lunch> when they logged it and saw in the logs the whole function() blah stuff
[13:06:22] <jan77> Uhkis: thanks
[13:17:56] <codecutter> does jqyery add class multuple times if the class already exists? $('.foo').addClass('boo')?
[13:18:07] <taplar_lunch> no
[13:18:28] <codecutter> so i can skip the 'hasClass('.boo')?
[13:18:33] <taplar_lunch> sure
[13:18:37] <codecutter> cool
[13:19:05] <taplar_lunch> or $('.foo:not(.boo)')
[13:34:01] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[13:34:17] <taplar_lunch> how do you know i'm a guy?
[13:34:21] <taplar_lunch> stop lookin at my junk
[13:34:23] <randymarsh9> so i managed to get the error call to show up but it only works if i include a timeout?
[13:34:32] <randymarsh9> lol guys and gals
[13:34:40] <robertmaxrees> randymarsh9 show the code?
[13:34:44] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle or soemthing.
[13:34:50] <catbadger> in a fiddle most preferably
[13:34:53] <catbadger> ;)
[13:35:08] <robertmaxrees> beat you to it ;)
[13:35:28] <taplar_lunch> mmm, awesome idea for a porn about stock traders... "junk bonds - extra kink"
[13:35:48] * taplar_lunch wanders off
[13:35:52] <randymarsh9> my bad i've never shared on jsfiddle before
[13:35:58] <randymarsh9> how do i get a unique url?
[13:36:06] <robertmaxrees> click "save"
[13:36:08] <robertmaxrees> copy the url.
[13:36:47] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/xwugr232/
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> oh i remember this.
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> you have a plugin preventing this from working.
[13:37:37] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:37:58] <randymarsh9> well actually it works with the plugin now
[13:38:13] <randymarsh9> idea is to get the error to get triggered
[13:38:16] <robertmaxrees> so what's the new issue?
[13:38:28] <randymarsh9> well it's working as intended but only if i include the timeout
[13:38:58] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xwugr232/2/
[13:39:14] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[13:41:59] <randymarsh9> it's telling me "TypeError: $.ajax(...).then(...).catch is not a function[Learn More]"
[13:43:12] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[13:43:42] <robertmaxrees> (you can type $.fn.jquery in your console to find out)
[13:43:44] <randymarsh9> 3.2.1
[13:44:08] <randymarsh9> oops
[13:44:16] <randymarsh9> nvm that tells me 1.12.4
[13:44:32] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:45:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/xwugr232/4/
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> what about this?
[13:46:43] <randymarsh9> that one works
[13:46:48] <randymarsh9> how'd you do that
[13:46:56] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:47:09] <robertmaxrees> on the parent page, what's the protocol?
[13:47:12] <robertmaxrees> is it http or https?
[13:47:37] <randymarsh9> well right now i'm testing locally
[13:47:40] <randymarsh9> but it's http
[13:48:06] <taplar> localhost -> offsite?
[13:48:13] <robertmaxrees> "testing locally" doens't matter - the protocol for the page you're hitting does.
[13:49:19] <randymarsh9> well i was using http but looks like i can use either one
[13:50:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering if maybe you were hitting https before.
[13:50:57] <robertmaxrees> and then hitting the http endpoint for this geoip service
[13:51:42] <randymarsh9> no idea but whatever the code you wrote works 100X better than what i had before
[13:52:16] <randymarsh9> this is exactly what i was trying to do earlier so thank you
[13:52:56] <robertmaxrees> also: dataType jsonp?
[13:53:01] <robertmaxrees> why did you include that?
[13:53:07] <randymarsh9> i thought i needed it
[13:53:10] <randymarsh9> lol
[13:53:23] <robertmaxrees> ... why?
[13:53:29] <robertmaxrees> also: type: 'POST'?
[13:53:43] <randymarsh9> i was following a guide online
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> for this service?
[13:54:10] <randymarsh9> yea but it was posted on some random blog
[13:54:33] <robertmaxrees> uh, weird.
[13:54:33] <robertmaxrees> so
[13:54:42] <randymarsh9> i don't know why it was included if the code you wrote works without it
[13:54:48] <robertmaxrees> link?
[13:55:19] <randymarsh9> i already closed it let me see if i can find it
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> either way, the page says it's a get, not a post, and it doesn't require jsonp
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> 9/10, start with less and add more as needed.
[13:57:26] <randymarsh9> if anything it should be type: 'GET' datatype 'json' right?
[13:57:31] <randymarsh9> yea
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:57:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:57:50] <randymarsh9> lol
[13:57:53] <robertmaxrees> type defaults to 'get', and datatype usually isn't needed.
[13:58:27] <randymarsh9> okay that's a good rule to follow
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ -> search for "dataType (default:"
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> (without quotes
[13:59:50] <randymarsh9> cool
[13:59:56] <randymarsh9> so it does it in that order by default?
[14:00:36] <randymarsh9> err picks the correct one automatically it seems
[14:01:57] <taplar> it's often the case that an endpoint returning json will set the Content-Type: 'application/json' on the response.  jQuery uses that unless you tell it not to
[14:02:38] <taplar> which is another reason if you are creating your own endpoints to keep that in mind to lessen the amount of frontend boilerplate you have to write
[14:08:56] <randymarsh9> out of curiousity how long have you guys been using jquery?
[14:09:14] <taplar> uh.... few years
[14:09:43] <randymarsh9> couple months here :\
[14:10:02] <taplar> its all good
[14:10:21] <randymarsh9> wish i started sooner
[14:10:28] <randymarsh9> jquery's pretty cool
[14:10:58] <taplar> i think robert and i are slowly moving on to other things though, lol
[14:11:10] <randymarsh9> wait really? why
[14:11:37] <taplar> we're doing more angular in shop, and i'm personally trying to learn vue.  i think robert's doing more react now
[14:11:39] <randymarsh9> you mean like angular or something else?
[14:11:40] <randymarsh9> ya
[14:12:13] <randymarsh9> angular and react seem to be the most popular frameworks right now
[14:13:35] <randymarsh9> never heard of vue that's probably a lot newer
[14:13:43] <taplar> it's comparable to react
[14:14:01] <taplar> same concept, focus on the MV
[14:14:09] <taplar> shadow dom
[14:14:12] <taplar> etc
[14:14:41] <taplar> it's coming standard with laravel installs now days i believe which is where it is picking up steam
[14:16:44] <randymarsh9> man you programmers are way over my head lmao
[14:16:51] <randymarsh9> think i'll just stick with my jquery for now :)
[14:17:25] <taplar> if you're doing javascript, your a programmer, ;)
[14:17:33] <taplar> *you're
[14:29:09] <randymarsh9> programmer hobbyist at most lol. got a long way to go
[14:30:34] <robertmaxrees> w/r/t to the question about time - i've been using it for like... 6 or 7 years at this point?
[14:32:27] <randymarsh9> cool i was surprised how long it's been around when i first came across it
[14:32:37] <randymarsh9> that's what i get for not keeping up with web technology's for the past decade
[14:33:22] <robertmaxrees> even better, things have come full circle and a lot of DOM APIs are inspired by jQuery directly.
[14:40:56] <taplar> heh, and the longer you've waited, the more time you've allowed browsers to get their shit together
[14:42:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> but that doesn't mean that old browsers stopped existing.
[14:42:38] <randymarsh9> yea web development is definitely easier now. so many libraries at your disposal
[14:43:14] <randymarsh9> and stackoverflow posts lol
[14:43:31] <taplar> true, though i think IE7 is out of support now?  just have to wait for IE 8 to die
[14:44:16] <robertmaxrees> IE7, IE8, IE9, and IE10 all lost official support in jan. of 2016
[14:44:27] <taplar> oh sweet!
[14:44:35] <taplar> we still have to support 8 though
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> we do, too.
[14:44:43] <robertmaxrees> only critical paths tho.
[14:44:59] <robertmaxrees> the pages don't have to look perfect.  not everything has to work.  just gotta be able to add to cart and check out.
[14:46:51] <taplar> side note if I had a toddler i think i'd make him watch the jeff session video from today
[14:48:01] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[14:48:18] <taplar> "this environment of leaking must stop!"
[14:48:26] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[14:49:08] <taplar> and of course https://pics.onsizzle.com/donald-trump-anthony-scaramucci-how-tolose-guynio-days-how-to-26485079.png
[14:49:36] <taplar> idk why they included the text at the bottom...
[14:50:14] <robertmaxrees> might be trying to help bots with OCR reading
[17:06:06] <grill>  what does this syntax mean? $('tr', $someBlock)
[17:06:38] <taplar> find the tr in that element
[17:06:51] <taplar> though if $someBlock is already a jQuery object you can just do $someBlock.find('tr')
[17:07:32] <cannap> iis there any performance
[17:07:38] <cannap> when i would use this instead?
[17:07:43] <cannap> .find
[17:07:47] <grill> odd
[17:07:58] <taplar> you could use it in an each()
[17:08:03] <cannap> ok
[17:08:14] <taplar> $('tr').each(function(){   $('td', this).stuff.... })
[17:08:21] <cannap> woa
[17:08:26] <cannap> i could reduce some lines
[17:08:39] <cannap> first time i hear about this -.-
[17:08:44] <taplar> it just saves you from doing $(this).find(....) if you don't like that
[17:08:54] <cannap> yea
[17:09:05] <cannap> but why no one tells me about that
[17:09:10] <taplar> *shrug*
[17:09:13] <cannap> how often i make each and find
[17:09:17] <cannap> as the next
[17:09:56] <taplar> if you do that multiple times, $(this) would be more efficient
[17:09:56] <taplar> via caching of course
[17:10:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid $('selector', this) fwiw
[17:11:22] <cannap> i "cache" everything i use two times
[17:11:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:11:34] <cannap> without manipulate
[17:11:38] <taplar> robertmaxrees: what's your reasons?
[17:11:51] <robertmaxrees> readability.
[17:12:03] <robertmaxrees> expectations.
[17:12:19] <robertmaxrees> if it's prevalent in your codebase, right on.  i just avoid it when possible.
[17:12:32] <robertmaxrees> same reason i don't like this.$('someSelector') in backbone.
[21:37:46] <Tagor> How can I access $(this) in strict mode? I get '$this is not defined' when using strict mode. Example: $(document).on('click', 'a', function(e) { // how to access $(this)? } );
