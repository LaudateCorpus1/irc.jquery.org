[03:23:35] <devi8> anybody know of a good end-line autocomplete for email addresses?
[03:24:25] <devi8> you know where you type @ and an autocomplete list of popular email services is activated in an email field.
[03:32:28] <Cork> i don't know of a good away to do that, specifically cause you can't modify what is in an input field without moving the input cursor
[03:33:39] <devi8> kind of like they do autocomplete with a datalist, I assumed. I see it on mobile devices that list options above the input field that get filtered as you type.
[03:36:32] <Cork> sure that is one thing, but what i talk about is when it is suppose to do part of the value in the input field
[03:36:52] <Cork> so doing the complete email is easy, while only the domain gets buggy
[04:01:31] <devi8> is $(arrayofitems).appendTo(dest) work or do I have to do $(arrayofitems.join(", ").appendTo(dest);
[04:02:05] <devi8> if arrayofitems is the resultant array returned from $.map
[04:02:08] <Cork> if arrayOfItems is an array of dom elements then yes it works
[04:02:30] <Cork> if it is an array of string it doesn't (and you can't do join after $())
[04:02:42] <Cork> if it is an array of jquery object it doesn't work either
[04:03:01] <Cork> the later can't be fixed without removing the double nesting
[04:03:29] <devi8> so if I'm creating jquery objects in my map, I'd be smarter to just return html strings then do the join
[04:03:49] <Cork> no it would be smarter to do return obj[0]
[04:03:59] <Cork> as then you would get the dom element and not the object
[04:04:13] <devi8> does that work with unattached elements as well?
[04:04:27] <devi8> I thought they had to be attached to get the element.
[04:04:27] <Cork> doesn't matter where it is in the page
[04:04:38] <Cork> it just works with the references in the object
[04:05:26] <devi8> so $("<span class='test'>test</span>")[0] returns an unattached element?
[04:05:49] <Cork> ya, but you souldn't generate elements like that
[04:06:08] <Cork> $('<span>', { class: 'test', text: 'test' })[0]
[04:06:35] <Cork> when you ask jquery to parse html you risk xss
[04:06:57] <Cork> (anything that relices on innerHTML does)
[04:13:55] <devi8> this is completely unimportant, but I just quickly tried to do this the way I thought it might work and it didn't work (not surprised and not worried about it)
[04:13:56] <devi8> https://jsfiddle.net/neverDevi8/c35w46u2/42/
[04:14:02] <devi8> but I thought you might get a good laugh
[04:14:26] <devi8> thanks for your help as always, I'm gonna let folks type their own email addresses.
[04:17:35] <Cork> why are you binding keypress separately for each jquery element?
[04:17:44] <Cork> .on does that by it self
[04:18:19] <Cork> also note e.target != the element the handler was bound on
[04:18:34] <devi8> I was thinking that I wanted to be able to add multiple email addresses, so it would be easier to register each one than to figure out a parent container for them
[04:18:51] <devi8> a little button that you could add email addresses
[04:18:53] <Cork> e.target == where the event originally was generated from, and can be vastely different
[04:19:07] <devi8> not if it's bound to the input, right?
[04:19:17] <Cork> cause input can't have children ya
[04:19:23] <devi8> it can?
[04:19:32] <devi8> cool, I honeslty didn't know that
[04:19:45] <Cork> it CAN'T -_-
[04:19:54] <Cork> you missed the 't
[04:19:55] <devi8> sorry I got excited.
[04:20:20] <Cork> but fore example code like that will break for a tags with for example a span inside it
[04:20:57] <Cork> <a><span>click me</span></a> $('a').on('click', function(e) { e.target != "a" });
[04:21:08] <Cork> so be very careful with using e.target
[04:21:22] <devi8> will do. thanks.
[04:21:37] <Cork> recommended is to use the normal this object
[04:21:41] <Cork> as it will always be correct
[04:21:56] <devi8> sometimes I do var targ=$(e.target).closest(elementIamlookingfor);
[04:22:04] <devi8> but I get your point.
[04:22:16] <Cork> ya, but wouldn't be needed if you use this
[04:22:47] <devi8> but this only works when bound to the actual element (like this one, for example--i see)
[04:22:57] <Cork> kinda silly when the browser does all that work to give you the correct element and then you just throw it away and do it again
[04:23:35] <Cork> just skimming the code, but are you creating an inline list under it?
[04:23:57] <devi8> yeah, I thought I would. I just did it really quick for practice.
[04:24:33] <Cork> ya, well remember though that the problem will be restoring the input cursor position in the input field when you insert the text
[04:24:45] <Cork> cause you have very limited control over that in input fields
[04:25:18] <devi8> the input field will lose focus when the shortcut link is clicked
[04:25:34] <devi8> so I won't have to worry about the cursor placement
[04:25:54] <Cork> well the input is most likely restored to the input afterwards though
[04:26:04] <Cork> so yes you will
[04:26:20] <Cork> and if you want to add autofill the real headaces start :)
[04:28:30] <devi8> $("label").on("click","a", function (e) { //what is "this" in this case
[04:28:35] <devi8> isn't it the label element?
[04:28:52] <Cork> it will be the a, IF the a is inside the label
[04:31:13] <devi8> All I get from JSfiddle anymore is the same error in console: [violation] added synchronos dom mutation listener...
[04:32:48] <Cork> jsfiddle has added some overly hard restrictions that makes it not really work anywhere anymore for me
[04:36:55] <devi8> $("label").on("click","a", function () {    "this" is the anchor, not the label...
[04:37:07] <Cork> like i said
[04:37:19] <Cork> but that is a delegated element, not at all what i talked about
[04:37:44] <devi8> you just said, Like I said, but not at all like I talked about....that's funny.
[04:38:04] <Cork> "<Cork> it will be the a, IF the a is inside the label"
[04:38:18] <Cork> but what i taked about was bubbling events and event.target
[04:38:28] <Cork> so not at allt related to jquery delegation
[04:38:40] <devi8> i know it just sounded funny.
[04:39:19] <devi8> and I missed the"a" in that sentence. I thought you said, "it will be, if the a is inside the label" I gotta lay off the 5 hour energy things.
[04:41:47] <devi8> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/ebjrGO?editors=1111
[05:51:51] <devi8> Cork, I got it. It works great though the code is ugly af. https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/ebjrGO?editors=1111
[05:52:31] <devi8> basically, I used the datalist autocomplete feature and automatically appended the username as soon as the @ gets typed.
[12:22:19] <IamTrying> https://i.imgur.com/KMJGmsW.png - Please fix this BUG. When <map> is used <input type=text Google chrome do not open keyboard on screen. Can someone report it to bug list?
[12:22:38] <robertmaxrees> Hrm?
[12:22:55] <robertmaxrees> is that a jquery bug?
[12:23:31] <robertmaxrees> IamTrying
[12:23:48] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: YES. it was related to jQuery / CSS/ Html but finally it end up that Chrome after 71 causing that break. But normal jQuery users it is impossible to find out the issue if it was jQuery or what.
[12:24:04] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: i lost 1 week thinking jQuery issue.
[12:24:07] <robertmaxrees> IamTrying not sure i follow.
[12:24:31] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[14:21:21] <MassDebates> he tried man
[14:21:27] <MassDebates> that damned jquery bug
[14:21:42] <robertmaxrees> nah, I PMed him and all is well now.
[14:21:52] <MassDebates> It wasn't a bug, was it
[14:22:05] <robertmaxrees> it was a bug.
[14:22:08] <MassDebates> With jquery?
[14:22:10] <robertmaxrees> but not a jquery bug.
[14:22:14] <MassDebates> chrome?
[14:22:19] <robertmaxrees> specific version of chrome
[14:22:35] <robertmaxrees> they didn't know how to submit a bug for chrome.
[14:22:57] <MassDebates> can I PM you?
[14:23:00] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:23:05] <MassDebates> okay.
[14:23:16] <MassDebates> I hadn't planned on it
[14:23:25] <MassDebates> but now that I think about it I can ask you something
[14:43:27] <gambl0r3> hello?
[14:43:56] <robertmaxrees> you know you can just ask your questions without saying "hello?" first, right?
[14:44:49] <gambl0r3> hey robert, you're in early today?
[14:44:58] <robertmaxrees> uh... no?

[18:39:29] <gambl0r3> taplar is definitely the head of this channel i would say
[18:39:52] <gambl0r3> if #jquery was vultron, tap would be the head.
[18:40:08] <gambl0r3> if #jquery were a bicycle, tap would be the chain
[18:40:37] <gambl0r3> tap i just a awesome person. he helps everyone!
[18:40:49] <taplar> when possible
[18:40:54] <gambl0r3> same with robert..

[18:41:34] <gambl0r3> where is he anyways?
[18:43:28] <taplar> not sure
[19:52:31] <sine0> two function reside inside of var foo = {} alpha and bravo
[19:53:12] <sine0> when I call outside to foo.alpha(), when inside of alpha, how do i call bravo. do I do this.bravo() or still reference foo.bravo()

[22:21:20] <Rojola> https://filebin.net/jjo9wvz3diab84w5/indexe.html?t=o4n03ew3
[22:21:32] <Rojola> I expect an alert to show up every time I click a checkbox
[22:22:10] <Rojola> unfortunately,  nothing happens for the 1st checkbox clicked.
[22:22:35] <Rojola> only _after_ the first checkbox I get alerts
[22:37:46] <Rojola> I will be AFK for about 45 minutes.  But I stay logged in in this channel.   I will read your answers as soon as I am back.  Thank you! :)
