[14:32:37] <diverdude> I have a grid defined like this : https://jsfiddle.net/xfcd31ng/   Is it possible to somehow implement a functionality where user click and drags to select multiple squares?
[17:25:54] <Miles8of9> hi all

[18:06:44] <diverdude> I have made this draggable rectangle on top of a grid: https://jsfiddle.net/3sq0atpc/    So see how it works click somewhere on the grid and drag around while holding mousebutton. For some reason the update of the rectangle is very slow and jerky. Why? Am I doing something very stupid here?
[22:48:39] <Jonno_FTW> hi
[23:01:08] <Jonno_FTW> is there a way to do this in one command? $("td[data-segment='"+el+"']").show(); $("th[data-segment='"+el+"']").show();
[23:02:42] <Jonno_FTW> $("td th [data-segment='Included+E']").hide(); doesn't work
[23:03:13] <Jonno_FTW> nvm I just need the comma
[23:04:10] <Jonno_FTW> or not
