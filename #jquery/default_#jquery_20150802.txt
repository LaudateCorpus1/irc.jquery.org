[01:34:33] <Braden`> Hello!
[01:35:10] <Braden`> If I have an input field:      <input type="text" id="p">, can I access the value of this element using $("p").value() ?
[01:35:41] <Uhkis> Braden`: it's val()
[01:40:27] <Braden`> Oh
[01:40:31] <Braden`> Sorry, I pasted wrong
[01:40:35] <Braden`> I am using val()
[01:40:42] <Braden`> But, I am still getting "undefined"

[03:28:10] <ycon_> Hi all, I need some help using noConflict (first time using js). I'm getting an Uncaught type error (here). http://www.stashdapp.com/download/. I just un-minified my files
[05:54:55] <Whiskey> It was not easy to select
[05:55:56] <Whiskey> $("table.Info tr td div span:nth-child(2)").html("tettst"); <-- try whit that to find this one "table < tr < td < div < second span
[05:56:43] <Whiskey> and have more i will change that way and was hope it just was to change nth:child(x) to point to the right one but now it change the most of the spans in the table

[08:49:42] <Zeranoe> I've noticed that if you view Google or Facebook's source code its almost pure Javascript. How do they render pages like that, and are they using some sort of program to convert it from HTML into JS? Finally, is that a faster way to render pages?
[09:25:33] <baby579> Hi
[09:25:42] <baby579> every one
[10:27:42] <arc_> k so i'm .load()ing an html document into a div, and i need to hide some elements inside that html document as soon as it's ready
[10:27:56] <arc_> i can do something dumb like setTimeout but i would rather be able to do it the proper way ... if it exists
[10:28:49] <bastones> arc_ : There's a third argument on .load() that you can add a callback function to.
[10:29:02] <arc_> all right let me see if i can figure that out, thx
[10:29:07] <bastones> This is executed as soon as .load() is finished.
[10:29:25] <bastones> Example from the documentation: http://jsfiddle.net/r0trrtwd/
[10:29:40] <arc_> thank you
[10:29:50] <bastones> I said third arg, I meant second!
[10:30:05] <arc_> :p
[10:30:17] <arc_> that worked :)
[10:31:07] <bastones> although you can use the second arg for sending additional data with your HTTP request. in which case, it's the third arg for the callback function
[10:31:52] <bastones> From the documentation: http://jsfiddle.net/r0trrtwd/1/
[10:57:28] <glitchmob> in the example found here: http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/ upon clicking one of the pictures, a lightbox pulls up. on the bottom you will see 2 arrows, how do I get those arrows to be brought up, middle justified, and be floated to each right and left side of container respectively. how do I upgrade the "arrow" situation
[11:38:16] <mynameisbrian> Hey guys. Why is the first one not sliding? It fades in, instead of slides: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/oXJYvq
[11:38:41] <mynameisbrian> It's not written to be continuous, so ignore that, it's just a piece of code to display this problem
[11:39:09] <bolognese> change the fucking animation to slide
[11:39:10] <mynameisbrian> it slides what has the class of .current. It then removes that class and puts it on the next sibling, so it can slide that one
[11:39:25] <mynameisbrian> bolognese, I'm not including fucking jquery ui
[11:39:28] <mynameisbrian> for one slide
[11:39:35] <mynameisbrian> fucking fuck
[11:39:41] <bolognese> why the fuck not you slappy cunt
[11:39:49] <bolognese> attach the bitch and append the proper animation
[11:39:51] <mynameisbrian> because that's a huge fucking library ya cunt. for one slide
[11:40:06] <bolognese> listen you fucking cunt its not that big
[11:40:13] <bolognese> its like fucking 87k?
[11:40:27] <mynameisbrian> no you're thinking of what your girlfriend said to you last night
[11:40:46] <bolognese> haha
[11:41:07] <bolognese> its not that big of a library people have high speed these days, what other options are there
[11:41:23] <mynameisbrian> I'm funny. it still should work either way though, even if it's not the best way to do it, I still want to know why the first one fucks up and doesn't slide
[11:41:55] <bolognese> jesus fucking christ let me check the link, but then u have to help me with what im working on
[11:42:06] <mynameisbrian> what are you doing?
[11:42:45] <bolognese> im trying to make these fucking arrows be floated to the MID of right/left of side of container, and maintain responsivity on this
[11:42:45] <bolognese> http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/
[11:43:19] <bolognese> i dont like the box action selectors for previous/next on the bottom, i want big fucking arrows on the right/left, floated and vertically aligned for every resolution
[11:45:32] <bolognese> im looking at your pen now, help me with that shit
[11:48:58] <mynameisbrian> oh that is going to be a bitch to do if they don't give a way to do it. the lg-prev has to be a sibling of lg-slider. then you float that, and lg-slider, and lg-next with percentage widths. the problem, however, is that lg-action is the container for this stuff, which is an ID, and more than one ID will fuck up the jquery event
[11:49:33] <mynameisbrian> so if you use this library and there is no option, it looks like you either have to change the ID in the code where it sets that event, then float them, or use some shitty position: absolute stuf
[11:49:43] <mynameisbrian> I'd just look for another one, idk
[11:52:36] <bolognese> bullshit
[11:52:40] <bolognese> it can be done
[11:52:54] <bolognese> all we need to do is hijack the functionality behind the lg action
[11:53:17] <bolognese> the css is so goddamn clouted
[11:53:38] <bolognese> just float the bitch in a new container with flex and vertically justify mid
[12:30:59] <jhave> Hello
[15:58:37] <jak2000> hi all, how to detect in a web page if user isnt completed any fields, i want display if the user press back button: "Leave the PAge or Stay on the page"? how do it? thanks
[16:25:54] <niggachefbaby> so I lost my mind last night
[16:33:13] <arc_> so this is a bit weird
[16:33:28] <arc_> i made a page, and the person for whom i'm making it complained it doesn't work in ie9 (groan)
[16:33:50] <arc_> so i switched from jquery 2.1.4 to jquery 1.11.3 and now it works?
[16:34:21] <arc_> afaik ie9 is still supposed to be supported
[16:41:06] <shoky> it is
[16:41:32] <arc_> i wonder what happened
[16:42:03] <shoky> ok
[16:43:37] <arc_> basically i used a delegated click event to trigger $(this).nextUntil('.class').toggle();
[16:43:43] <arc_> that's literally it
[16:46:41] <arc_> oh well, doesn't really matter
[17:43:17] <spillere> how can I put this string in a javascript variable? http://pastie.org/10326645
[19:29:45] <shakil> hello i'm facing a problem
[19:30:47] <shakil> sticky.js plugin showing this error "Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment"
[19:30:52] <shakil> what could cause this problem?
[19:42:57] <nodist> do you have a paste?
[21:43:47] <esaym153> having an issue when I add I replace some html in a div with a button and then try to catch click events on that button, the events are never heard. ( guess since obviously the button wasn't there when jq first initialized, but added later)
[21:44:16] <esaym153> so is there a way to 'refresh' the view of the DOM for jq after adding an element or something?
[21:44:40] <nodist> do you have a paste?
[21:45:17] <esaym153> nodist: me? it is a bunch of code, I would have to cut it up and anonymize it
[21:45:33] <esaym153> but i can...
[21:45:47] <nodist> yeah
[21:46:15] <nodist> how are you adding the element
[21:47:08] <arc_> esaym153 use a delegated event handler
[21:47:20] <arc_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[21:47:46] <arc_> you attach the event to an element that exists when the script is run, which then listens for children that match a second selector
[21:49:23] <esaym153> nodist: http://pastie.org/private/cxydwanf0vucdpriueezoa
[21:49:28] <esaym153> arc_: yes, I think that rings a bell
[21:49:48] <arc_> that's exactly what you need to do, the page shows the syntax
[21:50:10] <esaym153> nodist: see button class '.btn-success' is added later but the evenhandle is there in the beginning
[21:50:36] <nodist> esaym153 use arc_'s example
[21:51:05] <esaym153> :)
[21:53:24] <jak2000> hi friend wich is wrong why not display the dialog modal form? http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zymzLr7v/1/
[22:17:06] <jquery638> I know this isnt directly jquery related, but can anybody tell me why this https://paste.ee/p/VSpjf is giving me "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null" error? When I alert the m.getHTML() it has the correct output in it, could it be something to do with how I am getting it?
[22:17:33] <jquery638> I know I can replace document...('calendar') with $('#calendar')... but I want to get it working without jquery atm
[22:19:47] <arc_> where's the html
[22:20:11] <jquery638> in another function
[22:20:22] <jquery638> It outputs as it should
[22:21:56] <jak2000> hi friend wich is wrong why not display the dialog modal form? http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zymzLr7v/1/
[22:41:52] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:42:58] <jak2000> gurke_!
[22:43:00] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zymzLr7v/2/
[22:43:10] <jak2000> why not display the dialog form? give me a hand please
[22:50:01] <gurke_> jak2000, what is your goal?
[22:51:27] <jak2000> 1) show a dialog form with Cancel button, when show Cancel(hide the form) and again show
[22:54:54] <arc_> welp, just found something that works in ie11 but not edge
[22:55:10] <gurke_> hide and show? :>
[22:55:20] <jak2000> yes
[22:55:28] <jak2000> in my main project i can show, and hide
[22:55:32] <jak2000> but not againi show
[22:55:36] <jak2000> *again
[22:56:01] <gurke_> jak2000,  like this one? http://jsfiddle.net/gurke/kf0erdgp/
[22:56:28] <gurke_> its just css
[22:59:34] <jak2000> yes
[22:59:40] <jak2000> but i want with jquery friend
[23:01:29] <gurke_> why you want with jquery?
[23:01:43] <gurke_> its more compatible to browsers without
[23:01:57] <gurke_> and less cost of performance
[23:02:19] <gurke_> but.. it can be easily done with jquery
[23:02:37] <jak2000> wich url is for jquery ui?
[23:05:51] <gurke_> i gave you one example which works, i dont know why you just want to use jquery :)
[23:06:47] <jak2000> my main project use jquery man
[23:06:49] <jak2000> thanks
[23:08:25] <Json> Hello
[23:08:28] <Json> :D
[23:08:38] <Json> Anybody there?
[23:15:33] <norc> Given a $('.foo').nextAll() - I want to iterate through each element in the set, search through the descendants and return the first matching a given selector and then stop. How would I do that?
[23:15:49] <norc> I mean - is there a jquery way, or do I have to loop myself
[23:19:05] <norc> $('.foo').nextAll().find('mySelector').first() would work, but it does not really stop at the first element found
[23:19:32] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/zymzLr7v/8/ click on Ver Inventario Button, then Click on Cancel Button and again press Ver Inventario Button, at this point not display again the form here i smy problem, how to fix?
[23:20:54] <gurke_> norc .foo selector? :>
[23:21:17] <norc> gurke_: Excuse me?
[23:21:19] <gurke_> norc use the jquery selector directly?
[23:22:45] <norc> gurke_: Well, my situation is this; when an event is fired, I need to obtain some nodes related to the element the event was fired from.
[23:23:09] <gurke_> norc, i c... have an example?
[23:23:47] <norc> gurke_: $('.foo') was a bad example, in reality its more like function() { $(this).closest('someNode').nextAll().find('.someGroup').first(); }
[23:23:59] <norc> as a callback to some event
[23:25:16] <gurke_> $(this).children('selector')?
[23:25:48] <norc> gurke_: They are not children of $(this). They belong to a sibiling of an ancestor, hence the closest.
[23:26:08] <gurke_> hmm
[23:26:16] <norc> gurke_: And there are multiple that could match, and it needs to be the next sibling that matches.
[23:26:21] <gurke_> norc please do a jsfiddle
[23:27:06] <gurke_> i think $(this).next('selector') shall work
[23:34:46] <norc> gurke_: jsfiddle wont let me save, let me figure this out
[23:35:09] <gurke_> norc try codepen.io
[23:35:26] <norc> gurke_: nevermind reloading the entire site did the trick
[23:35:28] <norc> gurke_: https://jsfiddle.net/gvfx2f39/1/
[23:35:44] <norc> gurke_: Its working fine like that but it looks and feels clumsy
[23:35:45] <gurke_> ah
[23:36:07] <gurke_> does the target has a unique class?
[23:36:10] <norc> And in reality its a big tree with tons of nodes, so I really dont want to traverse through everything :P
[23:36:42] <norc> gurke_: There is no target, I just created it for demonstration purposes. I use the values to call functions and do magic
[23:37:10] <norc> or did you mean the magic nodes?
[23:37:36] <norc> Update: https://jsfiddle.net/gvfx2f39/2/
[23:42:02] <gurke_> weird
[23:44:09] <gurke_> norc cant figure out an easier way. sorry
[23:44:56] <gurke_> it should be very easy, i think its not too hard. but i think iam braindead atm
[23:45:10] <norc> gurke_: Yeah well guess Ill just traverse manually. :=
[23:45:31] <norc> I mean what I really want is closest but for descendants :p
[23:46:03] <gurke_> yea
[23:49:08] <Abhijit> Hi
[23:49:47] <Abhijit> in my ajax call i return json and i put it in div. it shows correct value. after putting in div i assign it to one variable. that variable do not get it correct. it shows it "0" by default.
