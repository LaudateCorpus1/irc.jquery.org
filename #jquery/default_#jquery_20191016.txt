[03:25:24] <naftilos76> Hi, i am using ajaxComplete() callback to get lost of info related to the response of every ajax request. One thing i could not find is the view file (called in rails) that is actually forming the response text. Has anybody got any idea of a way to get the name of that file?
[03:25:36] <naftilos76> lots of...
[04:42:48] <Cork> naftilos76: you would have to encode that data and send it in the response
[04:43:08] <Cork> naftilos76: that is server code and not something exposed to client side (as it is on the other side of the network)
[04:43:32] <Cork> all ajax sees is the renderd results
[04:44:08] <Cork> an option would be to set a custom header like x-view-path or similar
[06:46:58] <px12> people, what would be the jquery/phpdom selector for an href value containing the "admin_modify_lead.php?"
[07:08:40] <Cork> px12: you can have a try at *= selector, but be careful with it, it won't perform well
[07:09:03] <Cork> i would actually recommend adding a class to said links instead
[15:53:33] <dionyc> Hello
[15:53:46] <dionyc> Need some help refactoring javascript
[15:53:50] <taplar> shoot
[15:54:27] <dionyc> hi taplar check my codepen https://codepen.io/dionyc/pen/xxxOWej
[15:55:23] <dionyc>  i want to target the element onclick instead of what have to ensure it applies to the target element
[15:56:28] <taplar> just for my clarity, you're already using a click binding on an element.  you're wanting to change that to what?
[15:56:56] <dionyc> when i click on the input that i am targeting this element
[15:57:14] <dionyc> like using this or e.target
[15:57:59] <taplar> Ah, then you would want to select those elements, and on the click event handler, accept in the `e` on the event callback and you can access the element with either `e.target` or simply `this`
[15:58:10] <dionyc> yes yes
[15:58:42] <taplar> is there something with that, that is confusing you?
[15:59:17] <dionyc> just not sure how to arrange the code using this
[15:59:24] <dionyc> or e.target
[15:59:41] <dionyc> with what i have
[16:00:07] <taplar> well lets break the problem down.  first start by changing your selector, and accept the event in on the callback.  then address the next step
[16:01:52] <dionyc> ok like this "$("#accordionExample").click(function (e)"
[16:02:03] <taplar> you said you wanted to bind on the inputs
[16:02:51] <taplar> unless i misunderstood that part
[16:03:21] <dionyc> ok lets break down further
[16:03:57] <dionyc> example of this "changing your selector, and accept the event in on the callback"
[16:04:44] <taplar> My reading of what you were after was that you desired to bind directly on the inputs.  Currently your selector is on a single parent element
[16:05:04] <taplar> So if it is a a true statement that you want to bind directly on the inputs, you have to use a selector that will target them specifically
[16:07:38] <dionyc> ok so the selector the input
[16:09:03] <dionyc> and binding it to radioAccordian
[16:09:06] <dionyc> class
[16:09:29] <taplar> If that is a class that is on the inputs you want to target, sure
[16:11:04] <dionyc> updated from "$("#accordionExample").click(function ()" to  $("input.radioAccordian").click(function ()
[16:11:21] <taplar> aright, so that the first thing
[16:11:54] <taplar> now you can either pass in the `e` to the callback, or use `this` in there
[16:12:18] <dionyc> ok lets do this
[16:12:29] <dionyc> $("input.radioAccordian").click(function (this)
[16:12:32] <deepfreez> Hi, how I destroy the modal in bootstrap 4 after I press close button?
[16:12:50] <taplar> you don't put `this` on the arguments.  Its a special variable that is assigned to functions
[16:12:58] <deepfreez> $('#ArticleCreate').modal('hide');     $('.modal-backdrop').remove();     $('.sidebar-mini').removeClass('modal-open');     $('#ArticleCreate').remove(); those remove me the scroll in datatables
[16:13:01] <dionyc> ok ok
[16:13:21] <taplar> deepfreez i would think there is a destroy option/method
[16:13:32] <deepfreez> let me find it
[16:14:04] <taplar> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/#modaldispose
[16:14:17] <taplar> deepfreez ^
[16:14:26] <dionyc> so what is the right for 'this"
[16:14:36] <dionyc> *place
[16:14:39] <deepfreez> thank you
[16:14:45] <taplar> dionyc you don't have to do anything special for the this.  You already have it.
[16:15:34] <dionyc> ok np what is the next step here
[16:16:05] <taplar> so now if you click one of the inputs, that event handler will execute.  so when that happens, what logic do you want to perform?
[16:17:07] <dionyc> ok now i want to check if aria-expanded is false then radio button is selected
[16:17:30] <taplar> if a radio button is selected then `this.checked` will be true
[16:20:13] <taplar> but if you wanted to check that, you can replace `$("input.radioAccordian").attr("aria-expanded")` with `$(this).attr("aria-expanded")`
[16:21:43] <taplar> also, can I ask why the two radios have different names?
[16:22:11] <dionyc> not really
[16:22:14] <taplar> it looks like the purpose of this javascript is to fix the issue that the name are not the same
[16:22:58] <dionyc> they can be the same your right
[16:23:12] <taplar> if you want them to be exclusive, they should have the same name.
[16:23:26] <dionyc> updating that
[16:23:37] <taplar> Then really all your logic needs to handle for is checking if the option is not expanded but is checked
[16:24:12] <dionyc> i updated it to customRadio
[16:24:55] <dionyc> so initial state is both not expanded and not checked
[16:25:45] <dionyc> but when i select one of the them radio button is check and expanded when i go to the other one it callapse and uncheck and so on
[16:26:13] <dionyc> hope that make sense
[16:27:23] <dionyc> i have not added 'this.checked'
[16:27:38] <dionyc> i saved the pen if your checking this
[16:27:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ysL8vwkt/ it looks like the value of the aria-expanded is backwards from its actual state, at least at the point it gets in the click handler.
[16:29:04] <dionyc> Yes taplar ty
[16:30:10] <dionyc> taplar does the input value matter?
[16:30:38] <taplar> the input value of a checkbox would be what would be passed to the server if the checkbox was inside a form and the form was selected
[16:31:02] <taplar> err, i said "checkbox" there, but that applies to radio buttons as well, and all other inputs
[16:32:28] <dionyc> ty taplar want to get better on understanding this helps alot
[16:32:34] <taplar> np
[17:30:13] <deepfreez> Hi, :) again. It a way to modify a row in datatable (ajax)?
[17:30:27] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean deepfreez
[17:30:53] <deepfreez> https://datatables.net/reference/api/row().data()
[17:31:26] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[17:31:52] <deepfreez> I want to create a edit section (edit article) where all articles are displayed in datatable, but I want to modify only that row
[17:32:06] <robertmaxrees> that shows you how to do it...
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the confusion is.
[17:33:41] <deepfreez> $('#articles-list').DataTable().ajax.reload();
[17:33:43] <deepfreez> best way :D
[17:33:44] <deepfreez> thanks
[17:33:50] <robertmaxrees> k
