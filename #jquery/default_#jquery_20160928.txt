[02:31:15] <aro> if i have a data-elem="whatever" on a given element, and i trigger a click on that element - assuming i have a handler bound to click events on that element, will it be able to do: $(this).data('elem') and get 'whatever' from it?
[02:31:23] <aro> i have something like that, but i keep getting undefined
[02:33:03] <slax0r> aro: make a fiddle
[02:33:03] <Cork> aro: yes you can
[02:33:21] <slax0r> you're doing _something_ wrong if you're getting undefined
[02:33:24] <Cork> aro: with one caviat, the attribute is only read if .data() isn't called on that element before
[02:34:04] <Cork> aro: an alternative is to check with .attr('data-elem')
[02:34:15] <aro> alright

[04:18:58] <noaXess> morning all
[04:48:57] <xenaxon> hi
[04:49:07] <xenaxon> I am trying to integrate mailchimp through AJAX
[04:49:23] <xenaxon> so far I found this plugin: https://github.com/scdoshi/jquery-ajaxchimp/blob/master/README.md
[04:49:33] <xenaxon> and I added it and integrated the code
[04:49:41] <xenaxon> but I don't understand, what url to send to
[04:50:07] <xenaxon> do I need to create an intermediary php  script that sends somewhere?
[04:50:13] <xenaxon> or how do I send to the API
[04:52:17] <Cork> xenaxon: that would depend on the backend, and is a better question asked there
[04:52:27] <Cork> but yes, js has to have an endpoint server side to send to
[04:52:52] <Cork> if the original form you have have an url that is the one you want to use (i think, never used the lib)
[04:52:53] <xenaxon> the plugin i'm using is usuing JSONP
[04:52:55] <xenaxon> to send
[04:53:09] <xenaxon> so I am thinking if this should be pointed directly to a mailchimp API url
[04:53:10] <xenaxon> or smth
[04:53:12] <xenaxon> or how this works
[04:53:16] <xenaxon> I am confused by the api
[04:53:48] <xenaxon> Cork: in the example of the jquery plugin for mchimp he is sending to this url: http://blahblah.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=5afsdhfuhdsiufdba6f8802&id=4djhfdsh9
[04:53:53] <Cork> xenaxon: https://github.com/scdoshi/jquery-ajaxchimp/blob/master/jquery.ajaxchimp.js#L22
[04:55:23] <xenaxon> Cork: yeah, what's with it
[04:55:40] <Cork> uh.. read the highlighted note...
[04:58:51] <lilalinux> I'm using draggable for a div. inside the div, there's a span with a click event. When the item is dragged via the span, how can I prevent the click?
[04:59:40] <Cork> lilalinux: i don't think you really can, the click will happen before the drag element even starts the drag process
[04:59:40] <xenaxon> Cork: I read it. but don't understand why he is sending to that url, and how do I make it send in my case
[04:59:54] <xenaxon> http://blahblah.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=5afsdhfuhdsiufdba6f8802&id=4djhfdsh9
[04:59:55] <lilalinux> I tried $(e.toElement).one('click', function(event) {event.stopImmediatePropagation();});
[05:00:09] <Cork> lilalinux: won't help as the click will fire before
[05:00:15] <lilalinux> that explains it
[05:00:34] <lilalinux> so all solutions at SO simply work, because they are lucky in their timing?
[05:00:54] <Cork> what you possibly could do is bind the click handler on the wrapping element and check where the event came from
[05:01:06] <Cork> and possibly check the class on the element when this happens
[05:01:22] <Cork> and if the class is "i'm dragged" you could skip doing anything
[05:01:32] <Cork> that MIGHT work
[05:01:40] <lilalinux> Cork: interestingly, when stepping through the code, the draggable code runs before the click code
[05:01:57] <Cork> lilalinux: you can't fully trust stepping with events
[05:02:03] <lilalinux> :-(
[05:02:04] <Cork> as they don't do a straight run
[05:02:16] <Cork> it goes in and out of browser code
[05:02:36] <Cork> so the exact processing order isn't fully reliable
[05:03:04] <lilalinux> thank you
[05:03:05] <Cork> lilalinux: but if that is really true (not sure how it could be) you could check the class on the wrapping element
[05:03:13] <Cork> to see if the class for dragging is sat
[05:03:26] <Cork> if it is you just don't do anything if(dragged) { return; }
[05:04:00] <Cork> (avoid killing events like you're life depends on it, it is a big source of bugs later if you do it)
[05:08:03] <lilalinux> By the time the click runs, the draggable class is already removed
[05:08:12] <lilalinux> ui-draggable-dragging
[05:08:13] <Cork> removed??
[05:08:20] <Cork> ah
[05:08:32] <Cork> lilalinux: that depends on what os the browser runs on
[05:08:41] <Cork> draggin starts on mousedown
[05:08:48] <lilalinux> oh, another problem then :-0
[05:08:50] <Cork> windows triggers click on mouseup
[05:08:58] <Cork> mac and linux triggers it on mousedown
[05:09:18] <Cork> (or if it was just mac that does that... don't remeber)
[05:09:58] <lilalinux> so the only option is to use explicit elements to drag or exclude others from being draggable
[05:10:37] <Cork> no, actually that isn't fully correct
[05:11:06] <Cork> you could bind a $(document).one('mouseup', function() {}) that removes a class set on body
[05:11:16] <Cork> and you set this class when the drag starts
[05:11:24] <Cork> and in the click handler you check for this class
[05:11:30] <Cork> that should fix this
[05:11:33] <lilalinux> thank you
[05:12:03] <Cork> but ya, mousedown/mouseup/click interaction is tricky
[05:12:21] <lilalinux> when do I bind that?
[05:12:32] <Cork> when draggable fires the drag event
[05:12:42] <Cork> (i think it is called "dragstart")
[05:12:51] <lilalinux> start
[05:12:59] <noaXess> i face a problem with latest jquery-ui about tooltip and position > collision settings, check this fiidle: https://jsfiddle.net/thomi_ch/r6kbwoyp/
[05:13:16] <lilalinux> but if that handler removes a class set on body, when do I set that class?
[05:13:26] <lilalinux> hmmmm
[05:13:29] <Cork> lilalinux: at the same time
[05:13:38] <noaXess> left a link's tooltip is fine.. no line break.. right one does get a line break... but i don't want that.. i want prevent that..
[05:13:39] <Cork> you set the class, then bind the clean up handler
[05:13:40] <noaXess> any hint?
[05:13:50] <lilalinux> ah
[05:13:52] <lilalinux> :-)
[05:13:54] <lilalinux> I see
[05:14:29] <Cork> lilalinux: and here is a good example of where return false; event.stopPropagation and all the like will hurt you
[05:14:45] <Cork> lilalinux: cause if that ever happens the clean up won't fire and things will go out of sync
[05:14:45] <lilalinux> true
[05:15:16] <lilalinux> broken beyond repair
[05:15:35] <Cork> well it just means the first click after won't work
[05:15:39] <Cork> but if they click again it will
[05:15:47] <Cork> so it is fairly self healing
[05:15:50] <noaXess> check this fiidle version now.. https://jsfiddle.net/thomi_ch/r6kbwoyp/7/ right link margin-right and now tooltip will only go until dialog border
[05:16:31] <Cork> noaXess: you want to set the binding element to the document
[05:16:42] <Cork> noaXess: that is what is biting you there
[05:16:50] <noaXess> that tooltip goes over dialog border, yes
[05:17:35] <xdevnull> Hello people, I've some question about jquery-ui is it the right channel? or they is another channel?
[05:17:42] <noaXess> Cork: is it the of option from position?
[05:18:17] <Cork> i'm not sure tooltip even has it, but it is a fairly classic ui problem
[05:18:28] <Cork> would have to dig through the plugin to know (i don't use it)
[05:18:37] <Cork> xdevnull: this is the one
[05:19:05] <noaXess> tooltip has position properties, whis is a global property for jquer-ui elements i think
[05:19:19] <Cork> it isn't
[05:23:57] <xdevnull> Is there anyway to remove all draggable/droppable events at one time?
[05:24:10] <xdevnull> instead of calling .draggable('disable'); for each element?
[05:27:15] <lilalinux> Cork: http://pastebin.com/TNiY53Ew
[05:27:26] <lilalinux> by the time the click is handled, the class is already removed
[05:27:38] <lilalinux> Chrome/OSX
[05:27:44] <Cork> hmm
[05:27:53] <Cork> lilalinux: can you make a jsfiddle showing the problem?
[05:28:08] <lilalinux> yes
[05:28:16] <Cork> also you could try with click instead of mouseup that might help
[05:28:29] <Cork> though that might also be too late
[05:32:06] <lilalinux> doesn't jsfiddle.net support jquery UI?
[05:33:56] <Cork> some versions of jquery has it
[05:34:04] <noaXess> lilalinux: it should but not all versions
[05:34:05] <Cork> but you can add it as resources on the left
[05:34:11] <lilalinux> https://jsfiddle.net/5amdLqjn/
[05:34:17] <Cork> (just copy the links from code.jquery.com)
[05:34:23] <noaXess> you have to load ext resource like https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css
[05:34:43] <noaXess> and https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js
[05:35:01] <noaXess> Cork: still not getting what i want with tooltip.. you said, you never used tooltip?
[05:35:13] <lilalinux> Cork: with "click" every first click is lost
[05:35:25] <Cork> noaXess: it was basically just a hint on what you could look at
[05:35:33] <noaXess> alredy tried..
[05:35:44] <Cork> noaXess: i don't know the code enough to give the solution
[05:35:48] <lilalinux> ah, stop is missing
[05:36:01] <Cork> but ya, it normally requires reading the plugin code
[05:36:07] <noaXess> Cork: no prob.. just searching for hitns ;)
[05:36:59] <lilalinux> hm, removing additionally in stop doesn't help
[05:37:04] <Cork> lilalinux: a side note, i would prob use add/remove instead of start/stop
[05:37:15] <Cork> as stopDragInProgress could be read as block :)
[05:37:29] <lilalinux> k
[05:37:34] <Cork> "stopImmediatePropagation"
[05:37:39] <Cork> but ya, it is up to you
[05:37:42] <noaXess> aha.. overwrite ui-tooltip class is the trick
[05:39:46] <Cork> lilalinux: https://jsfiddle.net/5amdLqjn/1/
[05:40:20] * lilalinux doesn't like timeouts :-(
[05:40:51] <Cork> lilalinux: you have to, cause you have to let the current event queue end before you can remove the class
[05:41:17] <Cork> though note it isn't racy as it has no time, so it will fire as soon as the browser can start a new context
[05:41:30] <lilalinux> ah ok
[05:41:32] <xenaxon> Cork: I found the php script for doing it from php
[05:41:33] <lilalinux> thank you
[05:41:44] <xenaxon> Cork: just have no idea how the jquery plugin is helping
[05:41:46] <Cork> lilalinux: that form i use a lot actually
[05:41:58] <Cork> lilalinux: when you need to talk between events it is often needed
[05:42:40] <Cork> lilalinux: so ya, the setTimeout isn't to "wait a safe amount of time" it is just, "let this context execute then do this"
[05:43:28] <lilalinux> works, thank you
[05:43:33] <Cork> np
[05:43:42] <Cork> sorry for the wild goose chase :)
[05:44:02] <Cork> i've been dealing with a very similar problem, but it was a few months ago so i remembered one of my tries, not the solution
[05:44:25] <lilalinux> :-) good enough
[05:46:17] <pihpah> I am setting height of an element with .height() method but for some reason its height is much greater than the value I specify. Why?
[05:46:54] <pihpah> It looks like calling .height() is just adds up to its height rather then setting it.
[05:47:01] <pihpah> Why
[05:47:59] <Cork> pihpah: create a jsfiddle.net showing the problem
[05:52:02] <pihpah> Cork: the problem was caused by paddings. I set margin and padding to 0 and that solved it.
[05:52:23] <pihpah> Weird anyway
[05:54:01] <Cork> pihpah: you might be seeing border collapse
[05:54:12] <Cork> hard to say without seeing it

[06:54:25] <Cork> jquery962: i would quite strongly recommend NOT going that route
[06:54:59] <Cork> it is a pain for the user to use those solutions as you don't know what source the user uses (ex it could be a paste data they need to modify
[06:55:11] <Cork> better option is to show validation errors and let them fix it

[10:44:36] <chipyy> hey
[10:44:59] <chipyy> i am having some stupid question, how is correctly to write "ajax" ?
[10:45:15] <chipyy> should i always wrote "AJAX" or "Ajax" or "ajax" :)
[10:51:25] <soahccc> chipyy: Even though it's an acronym everyone is writing it as Ajax.  Funny fact, we have a cleaning supply called Ajax
[11:00:29] <chipyy> soahccc: u didnt help me anything :D
[11:01:02] <soahccc> chipyy: The answer is "Ajax" or just "ajax" but imho it should be all caps :)
[11:01:39] <chipyy> again i already know that :)
[11:02:12] <soahccc> then I just didn't get your question then I'm afraid :/
[11:04:35] <chipyy> u got it totaly, but i need somebody who is "expert" with rules of writing words :)
[11:07:15] <soahccc> chipyy: you mean what it _should_ be? I'm not entirely sure but I think if you create an acronym you have no rules to follow. I think AJaX (Async JS and XML) would be correct but who wants to write that :)
[11:08:32] <chipyy> ok i understand you now
[12:21:02] <taplar> man it's hoppin in here
[12:41:08] <wei_> hi does anyone know how to configure jquery mobile with require.js
[12:41:42] <wei_> hi does anyone know how to configure jquery mobile with require.js, I don't want jquery.mobile to overwrite the default style.
[12:42:37] <wei_> hi does anyone know how to configure jquery mobile with require.js, I don't want jquery.mobile to overwrite the default style. I have googled and found $(document).bind("mobileinit", function() {   $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled = true; });
[12:42:56] <taplar> please don't spam the room
[12:43:01] <wei_> but I can't seem to run it before jquery kicks in.
[12:43:02] <taplar> if someone knows they'll pipe in
[12:43:45] <arschmitz> wei_: im about to leave but the mobileinit binding should be after jquery core but before jquery
[12:44:24] <wei_> arschmitz: so how you do that?
[12:46:00] <arschmitz> you need to make a file that depends on jquery and runs your init code then loads mobile
[12:46:35] <wei_> requirejs.config({     paths: {         'jquery': './vendor/jquery.min',         'handlebars': './vendor/handlebars-v4.0.5',         'jquerymobile': './vendor/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min',               /* 'configdata': './pages/configdata',*/     },     shim : {         'jquery': { exports: "$"},         //'jquerymobile': ['jquery']     }  })  var BASE_URL = ''; // './app_dev.php/';    define(['require','jquery','handlebars','jquerymobile'
[12:47:00] <wei_> , jqueryMobile) {     'use strict';      $(function () {         $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled=true;         alert("hello from admin");       }) });
[12:47:29] <wei_> this doesn't work when I tried call $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled=true;
[12:52:00] <taplar> looks like that setting also relies upon the existence of a data attribute
[12:52:09] <taplar> http://api.jquerymobile.com/global-config/
[12:52:34] <taplar> it mentions if that is set to true, it will look for a parent to have "data-enhance=false"
[13:21:34] <robertmaxrees> thrilling day
[13:21:44] <taplar> yup
[13:36:29] <MikeD_> why does ui-datepicker-div get set to a background-color of transparent?
[13:37:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[13:37:38] <MikeD_> haha
[13:37:42] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:38:15] <taplar> was that a transparency joke?
[13:38:35] <MikeD_> i laughed because i thought it was
[13:38:38] <robertmaxrees> fwiw i'm not seeing that get set.
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[13:45:07] <MikeD_> any gotcha on version 1.11.0 ?
[14:00:32] <MikeD_> datepicker version 1.10.4

[15:35:45] <Caspan> question i have a script that I got online and it is calling things like .addClass
[15:35:57] <Caspan> so it is using a jquery library to do this
[15:36:10] <Caspan> but when i try to do .removeClass i get the error
[15:36:19] <Caspan> file.queueItem.removeclass is not a function
[15:36:45] <Caspan> if i have Jquery loaded I am not sure why it cant find the library when the line before it adds the class
[15:36:57] <Caspan> uploads.main.nu for my code
[15:37:04] <Caspan> upload.main.nu
[15:37:28] <Caspan> after a file completes its supose to remove the uploading calls and add a complete class
[15:37:41] <Caspan> uploading class*
[15:43:43] <Caspan> WTF now it works... NM
[17:08:35] <NTrash> Anyone got some awesome learning material for jquery?
[17:08:44] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com :)
[17:09:13] <NTrash> ty kind sir
[17:16:47] <RottenCore> https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landing-mobile.php <— neat form, right?
[17:16:49] <RottenCore> works well
[17:17:16] <RottenCore> multi-part form with the next button triggering the next fieldset via class in jquereey
[17:17:22] <RottenCore> class=“next”
[17:17:29] <RottenCore> i want the radio buttons to trigger the next fieldset
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:17:36] <RottenCore> so I wrap them in a div with class=“next”
[17:17:36] <robertmaxrees> this again
[17:17:54] <RottenCore> robertmaxrees: Ha! yeah I almost got it!
[17:17:56] <RottenCore> it works
[17:18:01] <robertmaxrees> don't use a class to do this.
[17:18:11] <robertmaxrees> like, don't just add the next class.
[17:18:13] <RottenCore> excetp the “next’ fires before the form information is accepted
[17:18:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:18:32] <robertmaxrees> let's do a quick jquery event handler 101.
[17:18:40] <RottenCore> yes please
[17:19:44] <robertmaxrees> so take this example: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bsex03j5/
[17:19:53] <robertmaxrees> you have a link and a couple radios, right?\
[17:20:41] <robertmaxrees> so lookie here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bsex03j5/1/
[17:21:00] <robertmaxrees> at the heart of your code is an event handler.
[17:21:47] <robertmaxrees> right now, that event handler is through an anonymous function.  this is gross, because then you rely on things like classes to handle them, and then you have issues where events fire differently and blah blah blah.
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> follow so far?>
[17:24:22] * taplar popcorn
[17:24:50] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:24:52] <robertmaxrees> i tried.
[17:25:06] <taplar> epitome right there
[17:25:36] <RottenCore> i’m with you
[17:25:44] <RottenCore> i’m reading through the jsfiddle
[17:25:55] <robertmaxrees> does it make sense so far?
[17:26:36] <RottenCore> yup
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:27:08] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[17:27:09] <robertmaxrees> so!
[17:27:27] <robertmaxrees> the cool thing is you can very easily pull out that function and use it elswhere.
[17:27:31] <robertmaxrees> just gotta name it.
[17:28:35] <RottenCore> right
[17:28:40] <robertmaxrees> so then you can just have https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bsex03j5/3/
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> right?
[17:28:46] <RottenCore> then I could use an onClick or whatever
[17:28:49] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:28:50] <robertmaxrees> never
[17:28:51] <robertmaxrees> never
[17:28:55] <robertmaxrees> never use onclick attributes.
[17:29:03] <robertmaxrees> html attributes for event binding are a BIG no no.
[17:29:43] <RottenCore> ok
[17:29:50] <robertmaxrees> but!  see that second fiddle?
[17:30:17] <RottenCore> yes
[17:30:52] <robertmaxrees> cool, so inputs have an event called "change" - that's really what you want to bind to.
[17:31:03] <robertmaxrees> so try changing the fiddle to run that functionn when an input changes.
[17:32:26] <RottenCore> i didn’t know that
[17:32:55] <robertmaxrees> right :) we kept trying to help you understand but you didn't want to hear it.
[17:33:01] <robertmaxrees> so try updating the fiddle to do that.
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:41:10] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore are you stuck?
[17:42:25] <RottenCore> no just having a connection problem
[17:42:27] <RottenCore> hang tight
[17:49:01] <robertmaxrees> !g jeopardy music
[17:50:10] <Darren_> $("#mobile-nav").slideDown("fast"); can I also add a fadeIn to this?
[17:51:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/21748469
[17:51:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:53:59] <Darren_> what would the reverse be?
[17:54:02] <Darren_> opacity would be 1
[17:54:07] <Darren_> but the height? 100%?
[17:54:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> the answer has it.
[17:54:30] <robertmaxrees> $('#myDiv').animate({opacity: 'show', height: 'show'}, 'slow');
[17:54:51] <RottenCore> i’m lost. ha
[17:54:56] <RottenCore> it’s not important
[17:54:58] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore what have you tried?
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> don
[17:55:07] <robertmaxrees> *don't just give up, yo.
[17:55:13] <robertmaxrees> you're probably a lot closer than you think.
[17:55:45] <RottenCore> it’s not that, it’s that it’s not a required part of the page, but the form validation is, so I’m going ot move on to that for now
[17:55:50] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:55:51] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:55:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:55:55] <RottenCore> gotta have it done by tomorrow night
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> you're killin' me.
[17:56:06] <RottenCore> ?
[17:56:41] <robertmaxrees> lol people keep trying to help you - we keep spending time trying to get you where you wnat to be.  and then you just kind of give up.
[17:57:56] <RottenCore> I know. I have a hard time getting my brain around it
[17:58:05] <RottenCore> and you guys have helped me a lot, it wasn’t doing anything a fw days ago
[17:58:08] <robertmaxrees> just sucks when you invest time and effort and it just kind of gets flushed down the toilet.
[17:58:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bsex03j5/5/
[17:58:40] <robertmaxrees> this is all you needed to do.
[18:02:00] <RottenCore> i’m going to revisit it after some coffee
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> but...
[18:02:09] <robertmaxrees> i just gave you the code.
[18:02:23] <RottenCore> I know, I saved it!
[18:02:25] <RottenCore> I’m goign to use it
[18:02:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:02:41] <RottenCore> I just need a break
[18:02:55] <RottenCore> cuz having it is one thing
[18:03:03] <RottenCore> but integrating it into the script I’m using is another
[18:03:12] <robertmaxrees> it'll take two seconds, but okay.
[18:03:50] <RottenCore> two seconds for you,maybe. ha
[18:04:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:04:26] <RottenCore> getting what you gave me and tackign on here: https://jsfiddle.net/cruezkmk/
[18:04:26] <robertmaxrees> whatevs mang
[18:04:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:04:39] <RottenCore> that’s gona be stressful
[18:04:39] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[18:04:41] <RottenCore> so coffee first
[18:04:41] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[18:05:07] <RottenCore> I know it’s just a matter of integrating it to the top of the jquery
[18:05:15] <robertmaxrees> the basics at least.  the hard part's gonna be fixing all the $(this) references.
[18:05:58] <RottenCore> but I don’t want to mess it up
[18:06:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cruezkmk/1/
[18:06:32] <RottenCore> right tha’ts what I mean
[18:06:35] <RottenCore> oh lemme take a look
[18:06:58] <robertmaxrees> all of the $(this) references will need to be changed.
[18:07:02] <robertmaxrees> but that shouldn't be too bad.
[18:07:53] <RottenCore> see that’s the kinda thing that seems easy but loses me. changed to what?
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your markup.
[18:11:40] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/cruezkmk/2/
[18:12:03] <robertmaxrees> right, so do you understand what $(this) is?
[18:12:26] <RottenCore> weird. tha’ts not workign
[18:12:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:12:33] <robertmaxrees> don't worry about that for the moment.
[18:12:42] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery in the fiddle.
[18:12:43] <RottenCore> oh wait, duh
[18:12:45] <robertmaxrees> but you won't need it.
[18:12:48] <RottenCore> right
[18:12:55] <RottenCore> forgot the external linkage
[18:12:55] <robertmaxrees> anyway - do you understnad what $(this) is in jquery parlance?
[18:13:00] <RottenCore> not at all
[18:13:06] <RottenCore> something i could google though
[18:13:08] <RottenCore> that was the plan
[18:13:39] <robertmaxrees> it's the thing that emitted the event.
[18:14:41] <robertmaxrees> so like when you have $('next').on('click' - $(this) is the current .next thing that was clicked.
[18:15:40] <RottenCore> ah ok
[18:15:51] <RottenCore> so whatever fieldset is displayed at the tiem
[18:15:56] <RottenCore> = $(this)
[18:15:58] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:16:04] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the next button.
[18:16:07] <robertmaxrees> i literally just said that.
[18:16:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:17:03] <RottenCore> oh by current i thought you meeant the next button being displayed
[18:17:09] <RottenCore> and thus fieldset
[18:17:15] <robertmaxrees> no, the button with the .next class.
[18:17:19] <RottenCore> but you mean it’s just the button wherever it is
[18:17:21] <RottenCore> I gotit
[18:17:29] <robertmaxrees> $(this).parent(); is what gets tyhe fieldset though,
[18:17:38] <robertmaxrees> because the fieldset is the .parent() of $(this).
[18:17:40] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[18:18:09] <RottenCore> yes
[18:18:22] <robertmaxrees> luckily, you just need to fix those two $(this).parent() calls.
[18:18:24] <robertmaxrees> which is easy.
[18:19:15] <robertmaxrees> use $(this).closest('fieldset') instead in both of those spots.
[18:20:30] <robertmaxrees> or, even better, var $currentFieldSet = $(this).closest('fieldset'); then just use $currentFieldset in those places instead.
[18:25:32] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/cruezkmk/4/
[18:25:39] <RottenCore> doesn’t want to work
[18:25:43] <robertmaxrees> no no no.
[18:25:48] <robertmaxrees> that var needs to be in the function.
[18:26:23] <RottenCore> ah.
[18:27:58] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/cruezkmk/6/
[18:28:26] <robertmaxrees> right so you still need the .next9) in there too.
[18:28:37] <robertmaxrees> $(".previous").click(function(){ will need the var as well.
[18:29:47] <RottenCore> is next9 a typo?
[18:29:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[18:29:57] <robertmaxrees> yopu had .next()
[18:29:59] <robertmaxrees> remember?
[18:30:00] <RottenCore> good you realy confused me
[18:30:01] <RottenCore> right
[18:32:06] <RottenCore> ok. added the var to .previous function. not sure what to do about .next though
[18:32:12] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:32:18] <robertmaxrees> remember before when it was $(this).parent().next() ?
[18:32:49] <RottenCore> yes
[18:33:32] <robertmaxrees> you still need .next()
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> next_fs = $currentFieldset; should be next_fs = $currentFieldset.next();
[18:40:59] <RottenCore> and .previous will need that too, right?
[18:41:09] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:45:01] <RottenCore> somethig like this: https://jsfiddle.net/cruezkmk/8/
[18:45:15] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:45:20] <robertmaxrees> next_fs = $currentFieldset.next();
[18:46:31] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening at all lol.
[18:47:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cruezkmk/9/
[18:47:36] <robertmaxrees> making it way too hard.
[18:47:38] <RottenCore> oh! did it in teh wrong place
[18:47:46] <robertmaxrees> just use what i gave you.
[18:47:47] <robertmaxrees> look at that.
[18:48:20] <RottenCore> i am
[18:48:38] <robertmaxrees> see what I did?
[18:48:41] <RottenCore> yup
[18:48:49] <RottenCore> I was doing it elsewhere
[18:48:56] <RottenCore> overthinking it
[18:48:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:49:10] <robertmaxrees> i was telling you to replace just the $(this).parent() part.
[18:49:14] <robertmaxrees> i literally meant to JUSTdo that :)
[18:50:12] <RottenCore> got it
[18:50:40] <RottenCore> so then we’ve gotta make it work with the class of the button, yes?
[18:50:53] <robertmaxrees> the .next you mean?
[18:51:02] <RottenCore> yes
[18:51:11] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:51:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:51:39] <robertmaxrees> dude
[18:51:40] <robertmaxrees> $(".next").click(nextPane);
[18:51:50] <robertmaxrees> it already IS working for the button.
[18:52:28] <RottenCore> oh. then what’s left?
[18:52:37] <robertmaxrees> need to target the radios.
[18:53:10] <robertmaxrees> replace $('.someClassOnYourInputs').on('change', nextPane);
[18:53:14] <robertmaxrees> with $('.inputRadio input').on('change', nextPane);
[18:55:02] <RottenCore> actually let me make sure that’s the class I used for the input buttons
[18:55:13] <robertmaxrees> it's what's in the fiddle.
[18:55:28] <RottenCore> oh it is, you’re right
[18:55:30] <robertmaxrees> you wrap each label+input with a div with that class.
[18:55:31] <RottenCore> cool
[18:56:39] <RottenCore> got it, done
[19:01:34] <RottenCore> so that shold be it?
[19:01:41] <robertmaxrees> you tell me.
[19:01:42] <robertmaxrees> does it work?
[19:01:49] <RottenCore> lemme run it
[19:02:01] <RottenCore> …and no. ha
[19:02:02] <RottenCore> https://jsfiddle.net/cruezkmk/10/
[19:02:15] <robertmaxrees> and you put this on your site, correct?
[19:02:30] <taplar> the dreaded jquery is not defined error
[19:02:47] <robertmaxrees> because the fiddle doesn't have jquery in it.
[19:03:35] <robertmaxrees> you're also still missing a var declaration in $('.previous')
[19:03:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cruezkmk/13/
[19:05:24] <RottenCore> yeah still not workign right
[19:05:32] <RottenCore> not auto-advancing or working with next
[19:05:34] <RottenCore> https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landing-mobile.php
[19:05:45] <robertmaxrees> .
[19:05:46] <robertmaxrees> .
[19:05:47] <robertmaxrees> .
[19:06:14] <RottenCore> what. haha
[19:06:19] <taplar> look at your console
[19:06:27] <robertmaxrees> the code on that page is not the same as that last fiddle.
[19:06:31] <RottenCore> going through it now
[19:06:32] <robertmaxrees> also, there's an error in your console.
[19:06:53] <robertmaxrees> what does your console tell you?
[19:07:08] <RottenCore> wait, fiddle 13?
[19:07:12] <RottenCore> it should be the same
[19:07:29] <robertmaxrees> lol do you see the error?
[19:07:38] <robertmaxrees> and it's not.
[19:08:26] <RottenCore> Uncaught ReferenceError: $currentFieldset is not defined
[19:08:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:08:43] <robertmaxrees> var $currentFieldSet = $(this).closest('fieldset'); see the problem?
[19:08:52] <robertmaxrees> uppercase vs lowercase S.
[19:09:20] <RottenCore> oh yeah
[19:09:27] <robertmaxrees> and update the rest of the code.
[19:09:30] <robertmaxrees> because it's not the same.
[19:11:31] <RottenCore> that’s fixed
[19:11:49] <RottenCore> now the fieldset disappears like it’s supposed to, but the new one doesn’t appear
[19:11:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:11:56] <robertmaxrees> because the code still doesn't match.
[19:12:37] <RottenCore> which part?
[19:12:46] <robertmaxrees> you're missing the .next() / .prev() bits.
[19:13:03] <RottenCore> I copied what’s in fiddle 13
[19:13:11] <RottenCore> are those not in there?
[19:13:25] <robertmaxrees> noppe.
[19:13:41] <RottenCore> oh wait I think i see
[19:14:48] <RottenCore> same thing
[19:14:51] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[19:14:57] <RottenCore> just copied and pasted form fiddle 13
[19:15:02] <RottenCore> https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landing-mobile.php
[19:15:29] <robertmaxrees> nah, you didn't.,
[19:15:35] <robertmaxrees> woah wtf.
[19:15:42] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[19:15:47] <RottenCore> i did! haha
[19:15:54] <robertmaxrees> and do you see what 13 is missing?
[19:16:15] <RottenCore> oh.
[19:16:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:16:34] <RottenCore> next_fs = $currentFieldset; should be next_fs = $currentFieldset;(.next)
[19:16:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:16:53] <robertmaxrees>  next_fs = $currentFieldset.next();
[19:17:00] <robertmaxrees> missing the prev one down below, too.
[19:17:09] <RottenCore> right
[19:17:15] <taplar> i see it on ln 228
[19:17:19] <robertmaxrees> and the casing is still busted.
[19:17:40] <taplar> i'm just not sure why the fields are being set to the current before then doing the next()/prev()
[19:17:52] <robertmaxrees> he copied this from some tutorial.
[19:17:57] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't muck with it.
[19:18:26] <RottenCore> yeah, as a way to hopefully learn. and learn i did. but i’m still learning
[19:18:36] <robertmaxrees> you REALLY need to get some foundational knowledge.
[19:18:42] <robertmaxrees> 'cause there's a lot of basic stuff you're missing.
[19:18:46] <robertmaxrees> check out learn.jquery.com
[19:19:11] <taplar> is this website an actual public facing site?
[19:19:24] <taplar> i mean, i guess it is since i can hit it, but...
[19:19:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:19:42] <taplar> :/ feels strange to learn on a prod page
[19:19:47] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[19:20:01] <robertmaxrees> iirc he's not normally the developer.
[19:20:07] <RottenCore> right
[19:20:08] <robertmaxrees> but his boss needed this done asap or something?
[19:20:10] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[19:20:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[19:20:17] <robertmaxrees> where should I send my bill?
[19:20:19] <RottenCore> he fired the developer and already way way over budget
[19:20:21] <taplar> lol
[19:20:33] <taplar> let me ask this, are there links on the site that go to this page?
[19:21:17] <RottenCore> nope
[19:21:23] <RottenCore> it’s a PPC landing page
[19:21:27] <taplar> cool, that's something, :)
[19:21:27] <RottenCore> campaign starts monday
[19:21:41] <RottenCore> “unexpected token” but i can’t find it
[19:21:48] <RottenCore> says it’s on 223 but it looks fine
[19:22:14] <robertmaxrees> really?
[19:22:19] <robertmaxrees> nothiung about that looks wrong to you?
[19:22:26] <robertmaxrees> next_fs = $currentFieldSet;.next(); looks totally fine?
[19:22:45] <robertmaxrees> semicolons are meant to go at the end of statements.
[19:23:20] <RottenCore> oh. extra ;
[19:23:22] <RottenCore> doi
[19:24:22] <RottenCore> huh. still not bringing the next fieldset
[19:24:39] <robertmaxrees> any errors?
[19:25:53] <robertmaxrees> i see the issue.
[19:25:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:26:38] <RottenCore> nothing I can see in console
[19:26:43] <robertmaxrees> i see exactly what you did.
[19:26:49] <RottenCore> probably something stupid
[19:26:50] <robertmaxrees> somehow your munged changes got saved.
[19:27:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cruezkmk/15/
[19:28:15] <RottenCore> which changes?
[19:28:27] <robertmaxrees> next_fs = $currentFieldset.next();
[19:28:30] <robertmaxrees> for instance.
[19:28:37] <robertmaxrees> missing ertmaxrees/cruezkmk/15/
[19:28:37] <robertmaxrees> [2016:09:28:16:28:16] <RottenCore> which changes?
[19:28:37] <robertmaxrees> [2016:09:28:16:28:27] <robertmaxrees> next_fs = $currentFieldset.ne
[19:28:39] <robertmaxrees> woops
[19:28:43] <robertmaxrees> missing next_fs.show();
[19:28:45] <robertmaxrees> etc
[19:30:44] <RottenCore> well how did I do that?!
[19:30:49] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[19:30:51] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[19:30:53] <RottenCore> I think I may have too may jsfiddle tabs open
[19:31:03] <robertmaxrees> and you never did the base tutorial ;)
[19:31:35] <RottenCore> that works better. previous not working now though for some reason
[19:31:45] <robertmaxrees> try to troubleshoot it.
[19:31:46] <robertmaxrees> figure out why,.
[19:31:58] <RottenCore> Cannot read property 'show' of undefined
[19:32:06] <RottenCore> which means
[19:32:20] <robertmaxrees> i probably copy/pasted something too fast.
[19:32:49] <robertmaxrees> probably need to edit the .previous click handler.
[19:32:56] <robertmaxrees> previous_fs = $currentFieldSet.prev(); instead of the next_fs that's there now.
[19:33:01] <RottenCore> oh I see what I did
[19:33:01] <RottenCore> right
[19:33:09] <robertmaxrees> that was probably my bad there.
[19:33:10] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[19:34:28] <RottenCore> it’s doing it on checkboxes as well, but that’s somethingI think I can change in teh styling
[19:34:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:34:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:34:47] <robertmaxrees> $('.inputRadio input').on('change', nextPane);
[19:34:50] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to change this.
[19:35:01] <RottenCore> right
[19:35:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not a styling change.
[19:35:14] <RottenCore> $('.inputRadio').on('change', nextPane); ?
[19:35:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:35:35] <robertmaxrees> that just targets the parent.
[19:35:47] <robertmaxrees> your issue is you have checkboxes inside .inputRadio divs.
[19:35:48] <RottenCore> no no
[19:35:50] <RottenCore> it is sa style thing
[19:35:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> how is it a style thing?
[19:36:00] <RottenCore> I have “inputRadio” as style for the checkboxes and it shouldnt be there
[19:36:08] <robertmaxrees> ah, so youneed to fix your markup.
[19:36:09] <robertmaxrees> gotcha
[19:36:22] <RottenCore> right
[19:36:29] <RottenCore> that’s what I mean by a styling change
[19:36:34] <RottenCore> not sure why it’s like that
[19:36:44] <robertmaxrees> generally when you say "Styling change" the implication is you're going into css.
[19:37:07] <RottenCore> right. no it’s the markup
[19:37:11] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[19:37:20] <RottenCore> I mean I’ll have to make a new class for checkboxes but whatever
[19:37:44] <robertmaxrees> sure. that would be the smartest thing to do.
[19:38:07] <NaN> hi there
[19:38:23] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[19:38:46] <NaN> is $(function() { ... }) safe to make my script work as aync?
[19:38:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:38:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not what that does.
[19:39:04] <robertmaxrees> that just runs the script on document ready.
[19:39:27] <robertmaxrees> has nothing to do with async.
[19:39:40] <NaN> how can I run my script when all my js is ready? (suppose an async load)
[19:39:52] <robertmaxrees> you... can't./
[19:39:57] <robertmaxrees> because you can't be certain.
[19:39:58] <NaN> D:
[19:40:12] <robertmaxrees> use something like require or whatever instead.
[19:40:17] <NaN> is there any document.allLoaded or window.doIt ?
[19:40:18] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[19:40:47] <robertmaxrees> there's a window.load(), but that's for all css, js, and images, but doesn't include, say, scripts loaded via other scripts.
[19:41:16] <RottenCore> there we go
[19:41:35] <RottenCore> robertmaxrees: Thanks man, I appreciate the patience
[19:41:36] <robertmaxrees> you're welcome ;)
[19:41:42] <robertmaxrees> where should i send my bill?
[19:41:51] <RottenCore> I’ll paypal you a beer when i get paid!
[19:41:57] <robertmaxrees> i already spent the time.
[19:42:09] <robertmaxrees> (just giving you a hard time)
[19:42:52] <NaN> I have an script that runs say $(function() { foo.go() }) the entire script is loaded async but when it hits foo.go() it says foo doesn't exists
[19:43:01] <NaN> robertmaxrees: ^
[19:43:15] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:43:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not async duder.
[19:43:24] <NaN> but... if I load my script without async it just works
[19:43:25] <robertmaxrees> $() is just document ready.
[19:43:44] <robertmaxrees> how are you specifying "async"?
[19:43:51] <NaN> <script ... async>
[19:43:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:43:59] <robertmaxrees> so in that case, you're kind of SOL.
[19:44:12] <robertmaxrees> that's one of those cases where async is not appropriate.
[19:44:22] <NaN> :c
[19:44:43] <robertmaxrees> if you have another script that relies on an async one, you're gonna have a bad time.
[19:45:01] <soahccc> I have a scrollable <ul> and keyboard shortcuts to select entries (up/down arrow). I want to scroll the list if the selected item is "out of view". I have a solution with jquery's position() but it breaks when the list gets longer
[19:45:19] <NaN> I still don't have it but maybe I will that's why I need to make my script async enabled
[19:45:23] <NaN> that's SOL?
[19:45:27] <NaN> *what's
[19:45:30] <robertmaxrees> shit outta luck.
[19:45:33] <NaN> lol
[19:45:34] <NaN> xD
[19:45:43] <soahccc> Basically I do container.scrollTop(selectedItem.position().top)
[19:45:45] <robertmaxrees> NaN "async enabled" won't fix it.
[19:45:56] <robertmaxrees> async is just that - order doesn't matter.
[19:46:17] <NaN> ok so if I make my script "async enabled" it doesn't matter when it loads but it will work
[19:46:18] <robertmaxrees> soahccc do you happen to have a fiddle showing what you're trying to do?
[19:46:28] <robertmaxrees> NaN nope.
[19:46:32] <theskillwithin> this is going to be good http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[19:46:54] <robertmaxrees> if your script is loaded async, it's async.  there's no guarantee things will happen before or after something else.
[19:47:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:47:19] <NaN> even if it's just 1 file?
[19:47:27] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing things.
[19:47:31] <NaN> I mean, I don't care when it's loaded
[19:47:36] <NaN> yes I'm >c
[19:47:40] <NaN> :C
[19:47:55] <robertmaxrees> as soon as you put async on the script tag, it's async.  the browser doesn't stop anything else, it just keeps going.
[19:48:18] <robertmaxrees> if you have a second script tag that relies on that to be done, you need to find another mechanism to handle that, because the page didn't stop.
[19:48:36] <NaN> then why it complains if it's only 1 file, I mean, foo object it's inside that file
[19:48:45] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: hmm this is hard since it's a JS terminal like thing. The odd thing is (haha) that it only bugs out on even entries (odd index)
[19:48:46] <NaN> can't explain myself :c
[19:49:00] <robertmaxrees> NaN is the code you're writing in that file or outside of it?
[19:49:07] <NaN> inside, all it's inside
[19:49:18] <robertmaxrees> NaN then something else is wrong.
[19:49:25] <NaN> foo object and foo call with $(function{}) it's inside
[19:49:32] <robertmaxrees> show me the code in a fiddle NaN
[19:50:16] <robertmaxrees> soahccc "it's a js terminal like thing" but you're using jquery?
[19:50:36] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: I think the problem is position() and it "relativeness"
[19:50:44] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: it's a simple thing :D
[19:50:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:50:54] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[19:55:04] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: hmm are you on mac by chance?
[19:55:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:57:57] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: okay I hacked everything into place I think :S try alt+r when focussed on input http://blitzfunke.bmonkeys.net/admin/test
[19:58:45] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[19:58:53] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah nvm.
[19:58:55] <robertmaxrees> okay
[19:58:56] <robertmaxrees> then what?
[19:59:11] <robertmaxrees> up?
[19:59:18] <soahccc> yeah up arrow
[19:59:26] <soahccc> every 2nd item it goes all the way up
[19:59:26] <robertmaxrees> where's the js?
[19:59:56] <soahccc> well it's a bit complicated but the code related to the scrolling... second
[20:00:04] <robertmaxrees> i see it now.
[20:00:12] <robertmaxrees> this smacks of bad math.
[20:00:34] <robertmaxrees> have you run this through a debugger?
[20:00:44] <ekkis> anyone here using query-validation?  I'm pulling my hair over this: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/my-input-fields-disappear
[20:00:46] <ekkis> help?
[20:00:49] <soahccc> no, just chrome dev console
[20:01:03] <robertmaxrees> soahccc the dev tools have a built in debugger.
[20:03:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting some weird errors.
[20:03:51] <taplar> ekkis: what is $.fn.ajaxForm?
[20:04:15] <ekkis> tappar: it's a module that converts your form submissions to ajax
[20:04:30] <ekkis> so when the user presses the submit button an ajax call is made instead
[20:04:33] <taplar> so your submitting with ajax, and then calling validate?
[20:04:40] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: you get errors on my page? I was doing things maybe :D this is the scrolling part: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7fc8f8ee8d41bcfedf1674772ff9a949
[20:05:10] <ekkis> well, validation happens before submission
[20:05:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[20:05:22] <taplar> ekkis: how do you know that?
[20:05:26] <robertmaxrees> soahccc oh coffeescript.
[20:05:26] <ekkis> and if I remove that call to ajaxify the form, it still fails in the same way
[20:05:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[20:05:57] <ekkis> taplar: validation is done on the client, before it gets sent to the back
[20:05:57] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: yeah but this is not the problem. Its something weird about position().top maybe I don't understand this method properly
[20:06:01] <NaN> robertmaxrees: I changed $(function() {}) to document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded"... and it worked
[20:06:02] <taplar> ekkis: you got a fiddle showing the issue.  i really feel like the issue is something to do with the form processing.
[20:06:13] <robertmaxrees> NaN then you have other problems.
[20:06:14] <taplar> s/issue./issue?
[20:06:18] <robertmaxrees> validate your markup.
[20:06:24] <NaN> sure I have it
[20:06:28] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: the weird thing is that it only bugs when the list is longer and on odd #/even index
[20:06:34] <ekkis> taplar: let me put one together
[20:06:39] <robertmaxrees> soahccc right, hence my math suggestion.
[20:07:04] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, position is the coords relative to the offset parent.
[20:07:31] <soahccc> offset parent means the parent dom element?
[20:07:39] <robertmaxrees> check the docs and read 'em.
[20:07:46] <robertmaxrees> iirc it explains what it means by that.
[20:12:14] <soahccc> robertmaxrees: hmm I fixed it by changing this... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5fc4f50071eef384ef9bf4a0bbcc373f
[20:12:21] <soahccc> and it's centered :o even better
[20:13:54] <ekkis> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/3x37hhwf/
[20:14:10] <ekkis> that should display an error if you enter "x" in the field and hit tab
[20:14:17] <ekkis> when you leave the field it should validate it
[20:14:24] <ekkis> but it doesn't
[20:14:27] <taplar> so that works for the tab
[20:15:10] <taplar> seems to work for me on blur
[20:15:12] <ekkis> it doesn't.  it doesn't display an error message
[20:15:20] <taplar> i hover over it and i see a message
[20:15:33] <ekkis> hmm........
[20:16:11] <ekkis> I've looked at it in Chrome and Safari.  I see no error message
[20:16:21] <taplar> not on hover?
[20:16:24] <ekkis> no
[20:16:29] <ekkis> nor when I tab out
[20:16:32] <taplar> i'm in FF.  looks good
[20:16:34] <ekkis> no error message at all
[20:17:03] <taplar> actually there is an error in the console for the fiddle
[20:17:11] <ekkis> interesting.  in FF I do get a red outline
[20:17:15] <ekkis> and hover with a message
[20:18:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3x37hhwf/2/
[20:18:49] <taplar> need to use the external resources option on the LHS for the other library
[20:18:56] <taplar> i see the message in the page now
[20:19:33] <ekkis> yes, i see it too
[20:20:13] <ekkis> this works as expected.  it displays the error next to the field
[20:20:25] <ekkis> in my code it replaces the text field
[20:20:40] <taplar> in your code your also doing ajaxForm.  your fiddle is not
[20:21:56] <ekkis> yes but I removed the call to ajaxform
[20:21:59] <ekkis> and it still fails
[20:22:15] <taplar> i can't help you debug if your fiddle doesn't replicate your issue man, :)
[20:23:39] <ekkis> I hear you
[20:23:48] <ekkis> I'll keep hacking at it.  thanks
[20:24:55] <taplar> is it this guy? http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[20:28:01] <ekkis> ok... figured it out.  the validator adds the class "error" to my field, which I have styled as invisible somewhere.  grr....
[20:28:12] <taplar> ah
[20:28:25] <ekkis> yes... it's that ajaxform.  very convenient
[20:39:57] <WillPittenger> For some reason, with https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js, $("body") is returning a Mozilla object rather than a JQuery object.  Any ideas what's going on?
[20:40:10] <WillPittenger> I'm using a Firefox fork called Palemoon.
[20:42:08] <WillPittenger> [19:41:45.798] TypeError: $(...).prepend is not a function
[20:42:14] <taplar> what do you get with console.log( $.fn.jquery )
[20:42:43] <WillPittenger> $.fn is undefined.
[20:42:51] <taplar> $ isn't jquery then
[20:43:00] <WillPittenger> Ah.
[20:43:03] <taplar> console.log( jQuery.fn.jquery );
[20:43:31] <WillPittenger> jQuery isn't defined.
[20:43:35] <taplar> :)
[20:43:57] <taplar> so you got some sort of loading issue with your jQuery include or something
[20:44:11] <WillPittenger> My Grease Monkey script has "// @require        https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js"
[20:44:45] <taplar> check your network tab, see if it's pulling it in
[20:45:27] <WillPittenger> Not there.
[20:47:11] <taplar> hmm
[20:47:17] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/779739/how-do-i-include-a-remote-javascript-file-in-a-greasemonkey-script
[20:47:51] <taplar> "Please be aware that, at the time of writing this answer, this @require  tag is only read at install-time. If you edit an existing user script to  add this tag, it will be ignored. You need to uninstall and re-install  your user script to pick up the change."
[20:48:08] <taplar> '10, so old answer but...
[20:48:51] <WillPittenger> Well, that @require has been in there for ages, but for version 1.9.
[20:49:09] <WillPittenger> Oops.  1.11.2 was what I had.
[20:49:26] <taplar> might try the re-install thing.  dunno
[20:49:39] <taplar> i stick my jquery min in my gm scripts
[20:53:39] <WillPittenger> Fixed.  Thanks.
[21:06:02] <WillPittenger> tapout: Does toArray give me an array of jQuery objects or DOM objects?
[22:05:25] <WillPittenger> Now JQuery acts like it's operating on not the real DOM, but a copy.
