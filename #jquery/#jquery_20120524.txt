[00:06:10] <Cork> Eshu: nice
[00:07:18] <Eshu> thnx bro but one question i draw the polygon on google map. but how would i get these coordinates any idea?
[00:07:27] <Eshu> Cork: thnx bro but one question i draw the polygon on google map. but how would i get these coordinates any idea?
[00:07:38] <Cork> Eshu: no
[00:08:03] <Eshu> Cork : Okey
[00:08:20] <Cork> i think it has an api where you can get an array back, but i don't remember
[00:08:21] <Eshu> Cork: np
[00:09:03] <Eshu> Cork : http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/poly/mymapstoolbar.html
[00:09:51] <Eshu> Cork: through these link i creates a polygon but don't know how would i get these's coordinates?

[00:46:29] <Robbington> HI I seem to be having a problem with encoding a Json response, returning false is fine, but I get JSON.parse: unexpected character if it returns true.
[00:47:11] <Robbington> seems odd that it will handle on php bool val false and not true.
[00:48:25] <Cork> Robbington: your using json_encode?
[00:49:40] <Robbington> echo json_encode(array('response' => true));
[00:50:02] <Robbington> Where true, would normally be a assigned var
[00:50:13] <Cork> so {"response":true} ?
[00:50:16] <Robbington> but for a test I have set it like that
[00:50:35] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"response":true}').response
[00:50:58] <Cork> bah.. the bot is dead again T_T
[00:51:09] <Cork> Robbington: that should work just fine anyway
[00:51:33] <Robbington> I have obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data); and as a test if(!obj.response) which works fine if falsy
[00:51:52] <Robbington> but returns that encoding error if true...

[00:55:47] <IamTrying> Google map street view i have make. Which one should i use existing jQuery library only or is here anything else there?
[00:55:47] <Cork> wfm
[00:59:27] <IamTrying> Google map has a street view, where you can do front/back/left/right/driving. I have to make similar now. Is there any existing jQuery SVG/VLM cross browser vector graphics stuff ?
[01:01:22] <larsemil> think i found a bug in jquery. i am doing $(item).remove(this) and it does remove the item. but it is adding: /\=\s*([^'"\]]*)\s*\]/g instead
[01:01:54] <Cork> larsemil: remove the item from where?
[01:02:02] <prefixed> what does .href do in jquery?
[01:02:26] <Cork> prefixed: nothing, there is no such function
[01:02:37] <tw2113> ?.href
[01:02:46] <Cork> if your using a pure dom object its the normal property
[01:02:48] <tw2113> :D
[01:03:03] <prefixed> for instance, what is this
[01:03:03] <prefixed> $(player).jPlayer('setFile', playlist[index].href);
[01:03:16] <Cork> depends on what playlist contains
[01:03:32] <prefixed> var playlist = []; // An array of DOM element links.
[01:03:45] <Cork> then it acts on the dom object of index
[01:03:56] <Cork> its not a jquery action
[01:03:59] <larsemil> Cork: from $(parent) where parent is the current div. The removal removes exactly the item we want,
[01:04:10] <larsemil> Cork: http://codepad.org/aKet1Dum
[01:04:58] <larsemil> leaving the reg exp instead
[01:05:26] <Cork> larsemil: not sure what your trying to do
[01:05:41] <Cork> .remove() removes the element you've matched with jquery
[01:05:52] <larsemil> yes. exactly that
[01:05:59] <Cork> the selector you can give to remove will limit it to only the one that match the selector
[01:06:17] <larsemil> it does remove just perfectyl
[01:06:22] <larsemil> perfectly
[01:06:24] <Cork> so $([this, that, something]).remove(this) will remove this from the dom, BUT keep it in the selector array
[01:06:36] <larsemil> yes, that is not a problem
[01:06:39] <prefixed> anyone interested in solving a REALLY difficult puzzle?
[01:06:53] <Cork> larsemil: then what is?
[01:06:58] <larsemil> cork: the problem is, the remove funktion prints out a string of text upon removing.
[01:07:06] <larsemil> the text is /\=\s*([^'"\]]*)\s*\]/g
[01:07:12] <Cork> ah
[01:07:14] <Cork> one sec
[01:10:12] <Cork> larsemil: you have a test case?
[01:10:59] <larsemil> http://voidab.destinator.se/sv/referenser/478
[01:10:59] <larsemil> Cork: ^^
[01:11:37] <Cork> larsemil: skimmed the code, and it takes a selector, not an element
[01:11:48] <Cork> so this shouldn't work
[01:11:54] <Robbington> Cork: Couldnt get it to work so just changed it to a string.. Thanks for your help anyway
[01:12:12] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/BTPUy/
[01:13:06] <larsemil> Cork: your code does not work
[01:13:09] <larsemil> ah
[01:13:11] <Cork> exactly
[01:13:11] <larsemil> shouldnt.
[01:13:46] <Cork> btw your link isn't a testcase its a big page
[01:15:02] <larsemil> well it worked if i did $(this).remove()
[01:15:09] <larsemil> strange error i got earlier though
[01:15:54] <Cork> ya, and thats how its meant to work
[01:16:19] <Cork> the syntax is ex. $(this).remove('#my-special-id')
[01:16:55] <Cork> but the element on the left is what it works on
[01:18:21] <Jatin> Hello
[01:18:24] <Jatin> This is Jatin
[01:19:24] <Jatin> I am here
[01:23:48] <varnie> Hi there.
[01:24:19] <varnie> when I am trying to submit form using jquery IE pops up  dialog asking whether I want to save or open file. what's wrong with that?
[01:25:06] <Cork> varnie: what content-type are you responding with?
[01:25:09] <Cork> (from the server)
[01:26:18] <varnie> from Live HTTP Headers I see that it is "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------18129588377078401092106086909"
[01:27:00] <Cork> is that the response ??
[01:27:28] <varnie> I am not sure
[01:27:46] <Cork> check what the server sends back not what the browser sends
[01:28:21] <Cork> if thats what the server sends, then ya, that would trigger a download dialog in any browser
[01:28:51] <Cork> as it would be interpreted a bytestream
[01:28:53] <varnie> it acts so only in IE.
[01:29:14] <Cork> so again, what content-type does your server send
[01:29:56] <varnie> I am not sure but the second http response has the following content-type: "Content-Type: application/x-javascript; charset=windows-1251"
[01:30:29] <Cork> ok thats better
[01:32:12] <sbarcteam> hi guys.
[01:32:26] <Cork> varnie: i don't think ie shows javascript files if you give it as a response to a form
[01:32:33] <Cork> but i might be wrong there
[01:32:54] <Cork> varnie: but use a better inspector then live http header it becomes messy VERY fast
[01:33:03] <Cork> varnie: use the net tab in firebug for example
[01:33:05] <sbarcteam> I have a <input type="text" .. /> and a dropdown list <select ...><option ...>....</select>
[01:33:43] <sbarcteam> I want to put the value of options upon selection to be put inside the text input.
[01:33:51] <sbarcteam> and to still allow to edit text manually.
[01:34:09] <sbarcteam> 1) which event shall I hook up to ?
[01:34:22] <varnie> net tab shows that content-type (as I showed above) and the next one response has "Content-Type	image/jpeg"
[01:35:13] <Cork> varnie: sigh
[01:35:15] <sbarcteam> 2) is it better use that select's selector via ('#selectid')  or via ('select[name=selname]') ?
[01:35:26] <Cork> varnie: check the one where your doing the post/get or what ever
[01:35:41] <Cork> the one with the url of your form submision
[01:36:13] <Cork> sbarcteam: if you have an id and its "valid" its better to use it
[01:36:21] <Cork> its the fastest way to select an element
[01:36:35] <Cork> though even better is to cache the element if you can
[01:36:43] <Cork> then you won't do any lookup at all
[01:36:51] <Cork> (except when you cache it)
[01:37:11] <sbarcteam> Cork: how do I know the id is "valid" ?
[01:37:29] <Cork> a valid id is uniq in the page
[01:37:41] <Cork> it may never exist twice
[01:39:19] <sbarcteam> Cork: oh that validity. ok. it IS valid.
[01:39:39] <Cork> then yes, its the best way to select an element
[01:40:05] <Cork> sometimes you can make a selector more generic if you don't use an id
[01:40:14] <Cork> but then you need more then one
[01:43:15] <ColKurtz> how do I make an element scroll?
[01:43:52] <ColKurtz> $(el).scrollTop(Y);
[01:43:54] <ColKurtz> >
[01:43:57] <ColKurtz> ?
[01:44:20] <Cork> scrollTop is a dom propery
[01:44:24] <ColKurtz> It's not working for me but I suspect there's another problemâ€¦.I'm trying to create  favelet that injects jquery so I can manipulate a Facebook dialog
[01:44:37] <Cork> you need a plugin to make it a jquery function
[01:44:43] <ColKurtz> okay
[01:44:49] <ColKurtz> well, how I can I scroll a div?
[01:44:54] <Cork> $(el)[0].scrollTop = Y; should work though
[01:45:15] <Cork> $(el)..prop('scrollTop') = Y; might work, not sure
[01:45:16] <ColKurtz> so the normal dom element
[01:45:19] <Cork> *$(el).prop('scrollTop') = Y; might work, not sure
[01:45:28] <Cork> ColKurtz: yes that or the scroll element
[01:45:35] <Cork> ?.scrollTo
[01:45:43] <ColKurtz> element.scrollTop = y;
[01:45:55] <Cork> bah bot-t is dead again >_<
[01:46:10] <Cork> http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[01:47:03] <Cork> oh... lovely the demo page is down too >_<
[01:55:40] <nFFF> Anyone use notepad++
[01:56:28] <species> on occasion, not for anything serious
[01:57:33] <nFFF> Whats the best window editor for autocompleting paranthesis?
[01:57:50] <nFFF> So when I type if (, it auto does if (), and places the cursor between
[01:57:56] <nFFF> Same for curly braces
[01:58:07] <species> nFFF: i generally find autocompletion highly irritating
[01:58:07] <nFFF> driving me insane having to type them all out :|
[01:58:18] <species> you get used to it
[01:58:23] <nFFF> I dont...
[01:58:27] <species> and anyway, its only 1 extra character
[01:58:47] <species> you type (a, b, c, d, e) <enter> instead of (a, b, c, d, e <enter>
[01:58:52] <nFFF> but with jQuery chaining evrything, it would help
[01:59:00] <nFFF> species, wait till yous tart chaining 7 methods
[01:59:23] <ColKurtz> will break
[01:59:25] <species> it doesnt have that much of an effect on your productivity
[01:59:27] <ColKurtz> break from an interval?
[01:59:39] <nFFF> species, I now it's only an extra character
[01:59:42] <species> and you'll find that it does it at the rong time
[01:59:44] <nFFF> it annoys me
[01:59:54] <nFFF> how could it be a wrong time for paranthesis?
[02:00:02] <nFFF> Ive seen it on a lot of developers editors
[02:00:06] <species> if you dont want a closing one?
[02:00:19] <nFFF> why would you ever not want a closing one? :?
[02:00:47] <species> if you are adding brackets around something
[02:01:04] <nFFF> I dont follow... you never want an unclosed bracket
[02:01:13] <nFFF> your code will break sir
[02:01:15] <species> no, but you dont always want it right after the opened one
[02:01:27] <species> sometimes the bracketing goes around a longer statement
[02:02:10] <species> in the end though these are all minor issues
[02:02:24] <ColKurtz> can i break from a setInterval() with the break; keyword?
[02:03:12] <xec_> ColKurtz: as in stop the next call? no
[02:03:23] <ColKurtz> how can i stop the loop
[02:03:24] <species> ColKurtz: you have to clear it with clearInterval
[02:03:36] <species> ColKurtz: to do that, you need to keep track of the return value from setInterval
[02:03:37] <nFFF> species, most javascript devs Ive seen in videos use it, I jsut cant find an editor for windows
[02:03:46] <xec_> ColKurtz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/109086 <-- google found me this
[02:03:51] <nFFF> I was hoping notepad++ does, but cant figure it out
[02:03:54] <ColKurtz> thanks
[02:03:57] <xec_> nFFF: you can try sublime text 2
[02:04:20] <ColKurtz> I can't clearInterval inside the function that setInterval calls??
[02:04:37] <nFFF> xec, they charge :<
[02:04:53] <ColKurtz> ah i see
[02:04:56] <species> there are many vim plugins :P
[02:05:04] <xec_> nFFF: yes but you can use the unregistered version as long as you like
[02:05:04] <ColKurtz> there' san example of using clearInterval in a named func
[02:05:11] <ColKurtz> what about an anonymous function?
[02:05:33] <nFFF> xec, downloading :D
[02:07:03] <xec_> i actually find the autoclosing of parens slightly annoying because sometimes when i want two ) in a row it already put one there and when i type ) it assumes i meant that one and just moves the cursor
[02:08:09] <nFFF> I have no experience with them as of yet, so in my head they are perfect :>
[02:08:23] <xec_> hard to explain, but it makes me miss a ) every now and then
[02:08:32] <xec_> if i'm not paying attention ;)
[02:08:41] <nFFF> do you still use them, or turned it off?
[02:09:21] <xec_> still got it enabled
[02:09:26] <nFFF> :D
[02:09:39] <xec_> nice to have, when it does what i want ;)
[02:10:38] <nFFF> I wonder if theres an editor that lets you set up rules
[02:11:03] <nFFF> I.e. when you type $ it auto adds $('') and puts your cursor in the middle
[02:11:28] <xec_> ColKurtz: the name of the function does not matter. it works the same with an inline anynomous function as well
[02:12:20] <xec_> nFFF: yes there are a lot of snippets and even a jquery plugin for sublime, and like i said, highly extensible. but i very often want a $ without getting $('') so that sound like a bad idea
[02:12:50] <xec_> nFFF: out of the box you can type $(' and get $('') with the cursor in the middle though
[02:17:01] <piker32> is there a way to set a callback to be fired when a particular objects attribute is set?
[02:17:38] <piker32> cleanly, that is
[02:19:11] <xec_> piker32: maybe this can help you? http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/
[02:19:26] <xec_> note the part at the bottom about platforms though
[02:21:00] <nFFF> xec_, are you one of those var $jqueryobject = $('foo'); guys?
[02:21:23] <nFFF> I can see how it'd hinder you, I onyl use $ when selecting though
[02:21:28] <nFFF> so for me itd save time
[02:21:44] <xec_> actually, no. i see the reasoning behind the convention but i don't use $ i var names
[02:22:03] <xec_> however i might have it in some text somewhere, like "$2.50"
[02:22:41] <xec_> or pass something to jquery $(var) or use a method like $.each() etc
[02:22:58] <nFFF> ah yes ddn't think of those cases
[02:22:59] <piker32> thats actually a pretty useful post but alas my situation isnt as simple
[02:23:14] <nFFF> thanks got sublime now, does what I want straight out of box
[02:23:17] <xec_> so turning $ into $('') all the time sounds bad to me ;)
[02:23:58] <nFFF> lol yea didn't think that one through :D
[02:24:44] <piker32> long story short, maintaining a legacy .NET app that uses oboutGrid (sigh) and the dev has a set of functions that updates the custom paging they have at the bottom of the grid
[02:25:17] <Famic> anyone knows of a plugin to handle round corners on text input or submit in IE ?
[02:25:25] <piker32> they have it set to certain items clicked update the pager
[02:26:31] <piker32> however the pager is driven by what is returned by the oboutgrid but sometimes the server doesnt post the response quick enough so the grid object's properties arent updated yet
[02:27:12] <piker32> their work around was to add in a fixed 2 second delay to let the grid update and then get the information they need
[02:27:54] <xec_> 2 seconds? ouch
[02:27:59] <piker32> (not so short story afterall :) )
[02:28:27] <piker32> yea, so if the server is quick it has the pager update way later which looks silly and if it takes longer then the pager fails
[02:28:30] <piker32> and is empty
[02:29:20] <xec_> sorry, don't think i can help with this - above my abilities and not familiar with this oboutGrid you speak of
[02:29:24] <xec_> ;)
[02:29:31] <zatan> hey I have got field class="product" " $(".product").click(function() { $(this).trigger("keydown"); });"    when I click on this field first time its working fine, on second click its not triggreing keydown why ?
[02:29:46] <piker32> ha well this is where hopefully someone can help :)
[02:30:09] <piker32> was hoping to bolt on a callback when a certain property is updated from null to whatever
[02:30:34] <piker32> once that happens, i know everything is back from the server
[02:30:45] <xec_> piker32: i have seen plugins that let you listen to DOM changes, maybe something you can use
[02:31:09] <piker32> sounds like the ballpark im looking in
[02:31:41] <piker32> ogGridObj.Rows    would be the object structure
[02:31:57] <piker32> Rows updated, its go time
[02:32:25] <xec_> .Rows ? is this asp.net?
[02:32:42] <piker32> nah thats their DOM object
[02:33:20] <xec_> you mean element?
[02:33:49] <piker32> yes, i suppose that'd be more appropriate
[02:36:42] <xec_> piker32: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2844565 looks promising
[02:38:24] <piker32> that it does ... giving it a go
[02:38:56] <xec_> anyway, they made us waffles for lunch today! yay! bbl
[02:50:02] <noregret> can someone help me display the json in a table as shown below http://pastie.org/3958239
[02:50:50] <Eshu> Hi guys any idea About Google Translator
[02:51:02] <Eshu> Cork: U there
[02:59:48] <martisj> anybody had issues with $.one('click', function(){}) allowing multiple click events/
[02:59:49] <martisj> ?
[03:12:30] <MacroMan> If I'm looping the cookies ('$.each(document.cookie.split(/; */), function() {});') and I add/remove cookies from within the loop, will the loop pick up the changes I've made from within it?
[03:14:22] <Famic> I'm looking for a solution to get round corners to work for text inputs and buttons in IE7/8. any idea ?
[03:14:34] <xec_> MacroMan: no, it shouldnt
[03:15:27] <MacroMan> xec_: Thanks.
[03:15:28] <xec_> MacroMan: the array returned from your split is what you iterate, it shouldn't change
[03:16:09] <MacroMan> xec_: Ok, that makes sense. ty
[03:18:15] <xec_> Famic: have you tried css3 pie?
[03:18:30] <Famic> xec_: it looks like the best solution so far, but I can't get it to work
[03:19:26] <xec_> well, styling form controls is never easy
[03:19:31] <xec_> it might not be possible
[03:19:34] <Mavvok> Is it a better practice to contain bits of data in <div> and just use jquery to show/hide them rather than trying to parse different HTML files for information and calling $("element").html(parsedhtml)????
[03:19:39] <Mavvok> <---noob
[03:19:53] <Famic> xec_: I have a stubborn client on this one :/
[03:20:28] <xec_> Famic: iirc IE supports contenteditable, which is highly stylable though
[03:20:44] <Famic> and I have to create a markup that will be used by different stylesheets, not all using round corners
[03:21:19] <xec_> Famic: do you have a live demo using css3 pie?
[03:23:23] <Famic> xec_: http://dev.lindicible.com/sggis/sg/
[03:24:05] <Famic> xec_: I'm trying to use it on the submit button
[03:24:10] <Famic> ("se connecter")
[03:27:52] <lost123> can anyone elaborate what does the error getTabs
[03:28:14] <lost123> can anyone elaborate what does the error mean >> cannot get getTabs of null
[03:30:34] <xec_> Famic: does it work if you test on other elements, like a div or whatever
[03:31:19] <xec_> lost123: without more information, all we know is that you're trying to do "getTabs" on nothing
[03:31:36] <xec_> lost123: is your site live somewhere?
[03:32:31] <lost123> xec_:  yes i will show you
[03:34:54] <Famic> xec_: I can get it to work on a div
[03:36:44] <lost123> xec_:  http://globalpublicvoice.com/
[03:37:25] <lost123> check the console, the slider and accordion both have a conflict may be, so they won't work togther
[03:37:30] <xec_> Famic: might just be a problem with form inputs then. maybe do a clickable div instead?
[03:42:22] <Famic> xec_: found the culprit : the filter setting up a linear-gradient on the input is interfering
[03:42:54] <lost123> xec_: did you check the link?
[03:42:58] <xec_> Famic: maybe the order of the rules matter too
[03:43:02] <xec_> lost123: yes still looking
[03:43:08] <lost123> ok thanks
[03:43:10] <xec_> lost123: looks like a mess
[03:43:12] <xec_> ;D
[03:43:21] <lost123> i know..so many jquery plugin
[03:44:06] <lost123> xec_:  the slider works when i remove the jquery-ui.js
[03:44:17] <lost123> but accordion won't work then
[03:44:22] <heeton> Is it possible to bind to an event, including any namespaced versions? i.e. bind('click.all') or something, so that it picks up 'click.foo' and 'click.bar' ?
[03:45:15] <xec_> lost123: sorry this is a bit too much spaghetti to straighten out, i gotta get back to work ;)
[03:45:30] <lost123> xec_:  ah its ok, thanks for looking at it
[03:45:32] <lost123> :)
[03:46:12] <lost123> xec_:  can you tell me what adds a height:0px online style to accordion div there?
[03:46:18] <lost123> if you have looked at it
[03:46:43] <lost123> the height becomes normal after i refresh the page
[03:47:13] <xec_> i haven't even looked at an accordion, tried to find the origin of the errors, but there's a lot of minified files and "b is null" doesn't tell me much
[03:48:05] <lost123> oh k
[03:48:23] <chilversc_> lost123: place a breakpoint on that attribute changing
[03:48:53] <lost123> if u can check now xec_ , the slider works, but i get no accordion method error for accordion
[03:49:08] <lost123> chilversc_:  i dont know how to
[03:49:23] <lost123> chrome debugger sounds complex to me
[03:49:34] <chilversc_> lost123: in chrome, find the element in question, right click, break on attribute modification
[03:50:01] <lost123> chilversc_:  http://tinyurl.com/7hq7lz2
[03:50:51] <lost123> i am getting a no accordion method, so which element should i check breakpoint for?
[03:51:47] <granden> Trying to do a simple jquery mobile webapp, but got a bit of problem processing the form I have built. site looks ilke this, http://agfoto.se/slope.html
[03:51:54] <granden> if you press BlÃ¥-BlÃ¥
[03:52:18] <granden> you get the form, but when submiting i it returns to default page, but it should just add a message to the current-page.
[03:55:16] <lost123> is there a way i can do the accordion like effect without jquery-ui
[03:55:19] <granden> any hep?
[03:55:25] <granden> help*
[03:55:37] <lost123> because i think theres a conflict of the ui script atm
[03:56:47] <xec_> granden: maybe try #jquerymobile
[03:57:10] <Xotix> lost123 fix the conflict. animate()
[03:58:02] <Libin> Hello everyone.. I am using the plugin jqprint for some printouts. but is there anyway i can specify a printer from my code
[03:58:56] <lost123> Xotix: where is it?
[03:59:06] <Xotix> lost123: what?
[03:59:21] <lost123> you said fix animate()
[03:59:28] <lost123> how can fix that
[03:59:53] <Xotix> lost123 fix the conflict or use animate. :) iirc animate doesn't need ui
[04:00:17] <lost123> Xotix: ah got it
[04:00:43] <lost123> but i have to write more code not just animate() right
[04:01:01] <lost123> with accordion() i just have to write it and it works
[04:01:28] <Xotix> yes with animate you can chagne width position etc over a time and create your won accordianâ€¦ anyway i'djust get UI working.
[04:01:38] <Xotix> *own
[04:02:28] <lost123> i am trying to get ui work since yesterday
[04:02:35] <lost123> but no luck
[04:03:16] <Xotix> lost123 no errors?
[04:03:42] <Libin> Xotix : is there anyway i can predefine my printer for jquery printouts.. cant find any resources online
[04:04:16] <lost123> Xotix: i have no accordion method error
[04:07:20] <Xotix> lost make sure your ui is implemented correctly. Libin idk jquery printouts
[04:08:49] <Libin> no worries.. thanks
[04:09:18] <lost123> Xotix: if u see the source, the jquery.ui.accordion is added
[04:09:51] <lost123> jquery.min.js is loaded, also the core and widget scripts are there
[04:10:03] <lost123> still it says accordion method not available
[04:10:37] <lost123> noregret: nice nick :)
[04:11:07] <noregret> :)
[04:11:30] <noregret> I got an array of items, and i want to associate/link each item with a number, how would I go with that ?
[04:11:33] <granden> If I want to process a form, not submit it anywhere. Just get all the values, do a few calculations. And then print the result. How do I do that in jquery, is there any example I can look at?
[04:14:07] <Xotix> lost123: you probably don't have the code for teh accordion. http://jqueryui.com/download
[04:15:08] <lost123> i just need to select accordion from that custom download, right?
[04:16:28] <kborchers> lost123: yes, unless you need other features of UI then you select those as well and any dependencies will automatically be selected for you
[04:19:16] <lost123> since i have widget and core scripts already incliuded
[04:19:23] <lost123> i dont need to upload them again, right?
[04:20:37] <nfk> i bet you get asked this a lot but why doesn't $("#some_id") selector work with rails?
[04:21:59] <nfk> for example `c = $("canvas")[0]` works but not `c=$("#canvas")`
[04:22:06] <nfk> same with any other id i have tried
[04:22:21] <Whirl3d> noregret, your question is really open ended. It depends on what you want to do with that relationship   Do you want to store data for each element in the element or do you just want them associated by name or index?
[04:23:27] <Whirl3d> nfk, is the # sign reserverved by rails?
[04:24:12] <Whirl3d> you probably get it to work with $("canvas") because canvas is an html element node name
[04:24:33] <noregret> nevermind, i figured it out
[04:24:35] <Whirl3d> were as $("jody") would not work for a div with id=jody
[04:25:26] <nfk> Whirl3d, no, it doesn't fail it just returns Object not the HTML element asked
[04:26:08] <nfk> from what i can tell, Object without any properties
[04:26:26] <Whirl3d> $("#someting")  will return a jquery object
[04:26:49] <nfk> $("#speed_entry").style.visibility = "visible"; //so this won't work?
[04:26:52] <Whirl3d> and that is true even if there are no elements selected
[04:27:08] <Whirl3d> there is no "style" method for a jquery object
[04:27:13] <Whirl3d> no
[04:27:47] <nfk> but then why does `c = $("canvas")[0];` work?
[04:27:51] <Whirl3d> you would use either $("#speed_entry").attr("visibility","visible")   or .prop (instead of .attr)
[04:28:09] <Whirl3d> because when you ask for $("#something")[0] it returns the html element
[04:28:14] <Whirl3d> not the jquery object
[04:28:53] <nfk> awesome, thank you
[04:28:57] <nfk> that explained a lot
[04:28:57] <Whirl3d> because jquery is an "array-like" object, you can get to the source html element using [0]
[04:29:03] <Whirl3d> np
[04:29:08] <shoky_> .css  not .attr  ;P
[04:29:19] <Whirl3d> lol, I wondered about that.
[04:38:25] <Mavvok> how would i set an item to have a default height but then expand if it fills up using css?
[04:39:23] <rosieres> Hi, can somebody help me ? Don´t know how to prevent executing a function if my attr has value "http://" in it . . .  http://jsfiddle.net/6FDVS/1/
[04:41:24] <Whirl3d> rosieres, try indexOf?   if (!$(this).attr'href').indexOf("http://")) {
[04:42:00] <Whirl3d> srry missed the ( before 'href
[04:47:47] <Eshu> Google Translate API no longer free - replacement required ... Why ?

[04:51:36] <Whirl3d> people suck
[04:51:44] <jayflux> hi jQuery heads
[04:51:59] <jayflux> why on earth does changing .text() of an element bump up the dom nodes?
[04:52:02] <rosieres> Whirl3d: Thanks works !
[04:52:07] <jayflux> its abusing memory and doesnt make sense
[04:53:04] <Whirl3d> rosieres, np
[04:53:14] <Whirl3d> jayflux, what is your selector?
[04:53:25] <jayflux> $('#x')
[04:53:42] <Whirl3d> can you repoduce this in a fiddle?
[04:54:30] <Xotix> if i have this number 134.5060893098782 how can i make it to have just 134? or in this case 135?
[04:55:08] <Whirl3d> Math.floor
[04:55:13] <Whirl3d> Math.ceil
[04:55:17] <Xotix> thx
[04:56:07] <jayflux> Whirl3d: working on it no
[04:56:45] <Whirl3d> then you gotta figure what's different between the blank fiddle and your implementation.
[04:56:47] <jayflux> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/A367T/
[04:56:56] <jayflux> use DevTools -.> timeline click memory
[04:57:03] <jayflux> hover over the backsquare and watch it shoot up
[04:57:10] <jayflux> its like its not garbage collecting somewhere
[04:57:32] <Whirl3d> you are adding the word TESTING to the span over and over
[04:58:08] <Whirl3d> ?hover
[04:58:09] <bot-t> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[04:58:52] <jayflux> Whirl3d:  yes of course
[04:59:11] <jayflux> Whirl3d:  i have an application where the text inside of the span changes on hover
[04:59:22] <jayflux> the only reason TESTING is used is for testing purposes
[05:00:14] <jayflux> Whirl3d:  any ideas?
[05:00:28] <jayflux> I don't get why its adding Dom Nodes every time i hover
[05:00:30] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/A367T/1/
[05:00:45] <Whirl3d> mine shows it ramp up and then drop off ramp up then drop off
[05:01:29] <jayflux> still going up though
[05:01:49] <Xotix> Whirl3d:  is there no mathemtaical function for rounding? like > .5 upwards else downwards?
[05:02:18] <jayflux> Whirl3d:  its still not garbage collecting
[05:02:24] <Whirl3d> not sure, but try Math.round()
[05:02:26] <jayflux> whether its your function or mine
[05:02:45] <Whirl3d> but given a second or two, ti drops back off
[05:03:12] <jayflux> was that to me?
[05:03:16] <jayflux> its not dropping back off
[05:03:23] <jayflux> its still going up and up and up
[05:03:32] <Xotix> Whirl3d thanks didn't see this one :)
[05:04:29] <Whirl3d> also, you are repeatedly searching the dom every timt the mouse enters or leaves
[05:04:56] <Whirl3d> cache your selector ahead of time, then implement hover correctly an lets check
[05:04:56] <jayflux> Whirl3d: can it not cache Whirl3d ?
[05:05:00] <jayflux> ok
[05:05:02] <jayflux> lets try that
[05:07:28] <jayflux> Whirl3d: still goes up
[05:07:35] <jayflux> Is it a bug
[05:07:49] <jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/A367T/4/
[05:10:10] <Cork> jayflux: whats the question?
[05:10:20] <jayflux> Cork: check out my jsfiddle
[05:10:26] <jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/A367T/4/
[05:10:34] <Cork> what about it?
[05:10:34] <jayflux> open dev tools, click timeline then click memory
[05:10:40] <Cork> ah
[05:10:41] <jayflux> hover over the black square and watch the memory shoot up
[05:10:48] <jayflux> it doesnt seem to garbage collect
[05:10:54] <jayflux> it keeps adding DOM NODEs
[05:11:13] <jayflux> it just keeps going up and up
[05:11:47] <jayflux> I have an app where text in an element changes when hovering over an element and it was crashing
[05:11:53] <jayflux> when inspecting/debugging I found that
[05:14:37] <ravenzz> is there a reason why if i have multiple background declaration within the css() object they are overwriten?
[05:15:12] <ravenzz> I am trying to set a linear gradient as background
[05:15:28] <ravenzz> but the last declaration drops the previews
[05:16:50] <Whirl3d> http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[05:17:00] <jayflux> ive posted a ticket
[05:18:36] <Kellen> Can custom events be attached to Array objects?  I may be doing something wrong, but it doesn't seem possible.
[05:18:37] <Kellen> http://jsfiddle.net/dQUmD/
[05:19:14] <Cork> jayflux: i can reproduce it here, but not sure what could cause it
[05:19:31] <Cork> jayflux: does it happen if you use html instead of text?
[05:20:23] <ravenzz> Whirl3d try these on Chrome http://jsfiddle.net/AZfzY/ http://jsfiddle.net/AZfzY/1/
[05:22:08] <sjeijk> how do i show a json string in a alert() ?
[05:22:26] <ravenzz> use console.log instead
[05:22:27] <Cork> just show it
[05:22:37] <Cork> sjeijk: json is just a string
[05:22:45] <Eshu> yes
[05:22:51] <sjeijk> if i alert it i get [object HTMLParagraphElement]
[05:22:57] <Eshu> you are right sjeijk
[05:23:00] <Cork> then its not json
[05:23:10] <Cork> or a javascript object for that matter
[05:23:13] <Cork> its a dom object
[05:23:24] <Cork> (a p element to be exact)
[05:23:35] <dns-away> Hello
[05:23:38] <Eshu> have you parse the obj to jason like parseJson(obj)
[05:23:40] <dns-away> How to. http://jsfiddle.net/RMnKX/
[05:23:49] <dns-away> Thanks :-)
[05:23:55] <ravenzz> could that be a 'bug' ?
[05:24:03] <larsemil> running php(cli) as root makes no errors, as regular user i get this: HP Warning:  PHP Startup: Unable to load dynamic library '/usr/local/zend/lib/php_extensions/mysql.so' - libmysqlclient.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0
[05:24:16] <sjeijk> alert($.parseJSON(data)); returns null
[05:24:45] <Cork> sjeijk: its not a javascript object
[05:24:57] <Cork> and its not a json string
[05:25:00] <Cork> its a dom element
[05:25:26] <sjeijk> hm ok
[05:25:28] <Eshu> sjeijk: then just do like this Obj = $.parseJSON(data); then alert(obj[0].id);
[05:25:29] <Cork> would even go as far as to guess that its a jquery object
[05:25:42] <Cork> Eshu: its dom you can't parse it!
[05:25:42] <Woet> larsemil: how is that relevant to jquery?
[05:25:48] <larsemil> sorry
[05:26:00] <patrickvw> I want to return true if an $.post is true but Iam it doesn't work

[05:26:28] <patrickvw> isnt there a way to do this/
[05:26:30] <patrickvw> ?
[05:26:36] <Cork> function start > ajax call > function ends > ajax response comes in
[05:26:41] <jayflux> Cork: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11809
[05:26:45] <Cork> patrickvw: no
[05:26:47] <Cork> use callbacks
[05:28:12] <Eshu> Cork: Right
[05:28:12] <patrickvw> I need a true or false in another function and i Dont know how to do this
[05:28:12] <Eshu> we can parse the dom obj
[05:28:12] <ImSexyAndIKnowIt> cork success: that's an example of a callback right ?
[05:28:12] <patrickvw> Eshu: ?
[05:28:12] <Eshu> patrickvw: wait
[05:28:12] <Cork> patrickvw: function a() { return $.ajax(...); };   a().success();

[05:28:51] <string> http://jsfiddle.net/RMnKX/ :-)
[05:29:20] <Cork> string: not sure what you want
[05:30:02] <Cork> string: you want to set "newhash" in JQTWEET?
[05:30:26] <string> Yes.
[05:30:32] <Cork> JQTWEET.hash = newhash;
[05:30:37] <string> exactly
[05:30:47] <Cork> so whats the question?
[05:31:01] <ravenzz> Cork do you have an idea if it is possible to set a linear gradient as bg?
[05:31:11] <Cork> ravenzz: sure
[05:31:17] <Cork> i do it on loads of places
[05:31:22] <ravenzz> I mean, with all the vendor prefixies
[05:31:29] <Cork> sure
[05:31:33] <Cork> except ie
[05:31:34] <ravenzz> how then?
[05:31:38] <Cork> it doesn't support gradients
[05:31:41] <jeffsmykil> what am I doing wrong here?  http://pastebin.com/bg2t6XJX

[05:32:16] <WiZZarD> ravenzz: you mean using css ?
[05:32:22] <Cork> ah from js
[05:32:24] <ravenzz> .css()
[05:32:28] <ravenzz> of course
[05:32:33] <ravenzz> this is not #css
[05:32:33] <ravenzz> :p
[05:32:46] <jeffsmykil> even without that stupid c it doesnt work
[05:33:01] <Cork> ravenzz: one sec need to check something
[05:33:06] <ravenzz> k
[05:33:44] <Cork> ravenzz: i don't think you can do it from js
[05:33:52] <Cork> ravenzz: set it on a class and set the class
[05:34:01] <ravenzz> the colour is dinamic
[05:34:02] <WiZZarD> what he says ;)
[05:34:03] <ravenzz> dynamic
[05:34:04] <Cork> (thats how you should be doing it anyway)
[05:34:16] <Eshu> patrickvw : http://jsfiddle.net/rkumar670/zBTzz/
[05:34:21] <WiZZarD> use css for the gradient, and alter the class if and when needed
[05:34:22] <ravenzz> it is just presentational crap, I need to add it in js
[05:35:00] <ravenzz> WiZZarD even if the color chances?
[05:35:06] <ravenzz> -c+g
[05:35:35] <string> Cork, please look again, what i want. Thanks : http://jsfiddle.net/RMnKX/1/
[05:35:44] <WiZZarD> why not? You can always update the information sent to the client right?
[05:35:48] <patrickvw> Eshu: Thanx for your trouble! I need some time because Iam a javascript noob
[05:36:00] <WiZZarD> how many colours do you want to use?
[05:36:02] <Eshu> okey
[05:36:25] <WiZZarD> If its a preset number, just add the corresponding classes to your css files and update the classes using javascript
[05:36:32] <Eshu> Patrickvw : okey np
[05:36:40] <patrickvw> lol
[05:36:43] <ravenzz> WiZZarD dude i'd have the same problem, WiZZarD trasparent to hundred ? :p

[05:37:06] <mantas322> Hi guys does anyone have any experience with jQuery file uploads using coldfusion?
[05:37:11] <mantas322> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1244-ColdFusion-jQuery-And-AJAX-File-Upload-Demo.htm
[05:37:13] <ravenzz> basically the same code is going to run on different websites
[05:37:21] <mantas322> I found this article, but it uses a hidden i frame
[05:37:41] <ravenzz> so I don't know in advance how many themes I have
[05:37:59] <mantas322> so im not sure whther this is the best route to take
[05:38:17] <rroelofs> ravenzz: how are the themes defined?
[05:38:31] <Cork> ravenzz: you would have to condition your code and only set the correct value
[05:38:51] <ravenzz> rroelofs basically I get the parent bgcolor
[05:39:01] <ravenzz> Cork I know :\
[05:39:11] <ravenzz> that's annoying
[05:39:12] <sjeijk> got json working tx for the help
[05:39:41] <Eshu> sjeijk: your welcome
[05:39:58] <Cork> ravenzz: it should be farly simple
[05:40:19] <rroelofs> ravenzz: wouldn't a translucent gradient that allows the bg color to show through be better?
[05:40:35] <ravenzz> otherwise I can do the worst thing in the world, concatenate the css rules and set them with attr()
[05:41:13] <ravenzz> i think that the problem comes from the css() function
[05:41:17] <patrickvw> Eshu: WOW IT WORKS many, many thankyous
[05:41:28] <patrickvw> I took me 3 hours already
[05:41:31] <Cork> ravenzz: no it comes from how js interacts with css
[05:41:54] <shoky_> jayflux: i don't think that's a jquery bug or memory leak
[05:41:59] <Cork> ravenzz: you could try http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/
[05:42:10] <shoky_> jayflux: jquery is not the one responsible for garbage collection...
[05:42:19] <AxonetBE> Why is this not working? https://gist.github.com/2781360 get always Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'live'
[05:42:23] <ravenzz> Cork in order to 'condition' my code I should check for the user agent and blabla i guess
[05:42:33] <Cork> ravenzz: nope
[05:42:48] <Cork> you on start check what prefix the browser has
[05:42:49] <jayflux> shoky_:  what you think it is then?
[05:42:51] <hooloovoo> AxonetBE: is it a jquery object?
[05:42:59] <Cork> ravenzz: then just append that to your value
[05:43:02] <ravenzz> Cork is it somewhere defined?
[05:43:24] <Cork> you could set something like $.support.vendorPrefix
[05:43:36] <shoky_> jayflux: you say this caused a crash?
[05:43:45] <hooloovoo> AxonetBE: also, use .on instead
[05:43:57] <jayflux> shoky_:  im not 100% sure to be honest, I had crashes but it may not have been that
[05:44:04] <jayflux> i just happened to come across it while debugging
[05:44:22] <shoky_> jayflux: if you look at the amount of memory consumed, it does seem to get garbage collected
[05:44:23] <Cork> aximilation: your prob using another framework
[05:44:33] <Cork> *AxonetBE:
[05:44:42] <Cork> AxonetBE: like prototype
[05:44:48] <ravenzz> Cork ok, but how I can retrieve the vendor prefix if I don't check the user agent?
[05:45:05] <jayflux> shoky_:  i don't get how replacing text in an element causes dom node count to go up ?
[05:45:07] <shoky_> jayflux: also if you click 'garbage collect' button in the timeline, you see that the DOM node count goes way down, meaning jquery properly disposed of the removed text nodes
[05:45:09] <jayflux> its not like you're adding elements
[05:45:12] <shoky_> it is
[05:45:13] <Cork> ravenzz: you could do it like prefix free does it
[05:45:18] <shoky_> it's a text element in the span
[05:45:23] <ravenzz> ah ok
[05:45:24] <AxonetBE> hooloovoo: but I want it on every input field, so input $('input') is jquery object no?
[05:45:27] <ravenzz> I'll look into that
[05:45:30] <shoky_> when you do .text(...)  jquery removes the old one and inserts a new one
[05:45:31] <Cork> ravenzz: but ya, checking the render agent in the ua is one way
[05:45:31] <ravenzz> thank you
[05:45:36] <shoky_> np
[05:45:44] <twiq> hi everyone! look, how can I make a http request of a remote url and load some of that content into the local DOM ?
[05:45:51] <shoky_> (im not jquery dev or smth, just my 2 cents ;p )
[05:45:59] <ravenzz> Cork supposing that it is not changed :)
[05:46:06] <Cork> AxonetBE: try replacing $('input') with jQuery('input')
[05:46:10] <ravenzz> I mean is the correct one
[05:46:29] <jayflux> shoky_:  if thats the case the line should remain constant and not going up?
[05:46:53] <jayflux> IE DOM NODE Count should not be going up if its just 'replacing'
[05:46:59] <shoky_> jayflux: yeah, i donno why it goes up
[05:47:09] <shoky_> jayflux: lets see what response you get to your ticket..
[05:47:36] <AxonetBE> Cork: nope doesn't help, I'm using jQuery('input')
[05:47:36] <shoky_> well, we do know why it goes up
[05:47:50] <AxonetBE> Cork:  jquery 1.2.6 I mean
[05:47:54] <shoky_> a new text span keeps being created, and the old ones are not yet garbage collected
[05:47:57] <shoky_> i suppose
[05:48:05] <lugzer> hi
[05:49:38] <shoky_> hi
[05:52:17] <lugzer> i'm trying to trigger a js-based tooltip to an element, i'm doing this when DOM is ready .. but my element is actually fetched via ajax, and looks like i can't trigger that tooltip.. is there some function in jQuery that can help me? ajaxComplete?
[05:52:53] <shoky_> lugzer: the done/success callback of the ajax call
[05:53:37] <lugzer> shoky_, so that's normal that $(document).ready(..) won't work with ajax based DOM?
[05:53:50] <Cork> AxonetBE: ah, 1.2.6 is before live i think
[05:53:56] <AxonetBE> ok
[05:54:16] <Cork> yup it was added in 1.3
[05:54:52] <shoky_> lugzer: if you're talking about event binding on dom ready, then yeah you can't simply bind events to elements that aren't there yet. but you CAN set up event delegation to some container element (e.g. a div)
[05:55:01] <lugzer> shoky_, ps. your tip worked! thanks!
[05:55:09] <shoky_> ;]
[05:59:37] <shoky_> twiq: with AJAX / JSONP / CORS / etc.
[06:04:16] <Whirl3d> '
[06:04:33] <Lucky--> If m y initial ajax request lags, but subsequent ones do not, is that typical of ajax, or do I need to dig into server and tweak settings?
[06:05:02] <Lucky--> namely IIS application pool cache timeout
[06:05:13] <dAnjou> hi, i'm about to use jquery's ajax functions to request URLs like that "/path/<parameter>". i see that i can pass data using a function like $.get() but it will look like this "/path?param=value", right?
[06:05:19] <twiq> shoky_, here's my code. Could you take a look please? http://pastebin.com/mSGtFyin
[06:05:29] <Lucky--> dAnjou: yes
[06:05:32] <jayflux> ill give someone 100 pounds if they can tell me why on earth this crashes when clicking the graph http://eltaselect.com/quick-selection/
[06:05:46] <dAnjou> do i have to use plain string modification, to build my request URL then?
[06:06:11] <twiq> shoky_, for JSONP I need to have access to server side code, wich I don't.. so that option is out
[06:06:38] <Lucky--> jayflux: ha! with the pound to usd conversion
[06:06:43] <Lucky--> im actually going to look at that right now
[06:07:32] <Lucky--> lol I think it crashed chrome
[06:08:54] <Lucky--> ideal gas law calcs?
[06:09:57] <jayflux> Lucky--:  if you fancy taking a look at my graph though
[06:10:01] <jayflux> i would be greateful
[06:10:53] <Lucky--> jayflux: i am
[06:11:04] <Lucky--> already got the debugger out
[06:11:57] <jayflux> thanks Lucky--  :)
[06:14:52] <Lucky--> so $100 pounds if i fix it?
[06:15:28] <dAnjou> dollar pounds?
[06:16:08] <Eshu> Lucky what is the problem can you post again
[06:18:30] <jayflux> Lucky--:  thinK i found it
[06:20:22] <Zhy> okay I can'T seem to be able to enable my a button again ...  $('.saveButtonInitialDisable').removeAttr('disabled'); doesn't work , is it because of the selector ? disabling it like this worked without a problem (.attr('disabled', true);
[06:20:44] <ezio> okay ... this is my issue.  a keypress is firing if a person hits enter or on the input or on the select.  i didn't expect this to happen but it happens only in ff. this is causing two things to be added to my list.  can anyone imagine a way around this?
[06:21:03] <Lucky--> jayflux: yea i think you are calling reduceright wrong
[06:21:08] <Lucky--> yea not enoguh params
[06:21:18] <Lucky--> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/ReduceRight

[06:42:25] <flu1> anyone? extending plugin -> http://www.pastie.org/3961051
[06:43:45] <Trisox> edusys: this might work $(document).ready(function () {     setTimeout(function(){         $("a").trigger('click');     }, 3000); });
[06:45:39] <Trisox> wpsmith: the ready event on jQuery('img.lazy').lazyload({ effect:  'fadeIn' }); doesnt get fired
[06:46:27] <edusys> Trisox: thank you, IÂ´ll try it :D
[06:47:03] <edusys> $("a.t-icon.t-refresh") is correct?
[06:47:23] <edusys> to match  <a class="t-icon t-refresh" ...>
[06:47:46] <wpsmith> Trisox right. I knew that. my apologies!
[06:47:54] <wpsmith> I am not sure what to change though
[06:48:17] <Trisox> yes correct
[06:48:27] <Trisox> checking
[06:49:09] <Trisox> lol the boss is geting ice creams for us :D
[06:49:44] <Trisox> it works now wpsmith

[06:51:58] <steveccc> i am using $('#mainmenu').animate({'marginLeft':'-190px'},500); - can i toggle this so that it returns to its original position or do I need to specify the original position?

[06:52:31] <edusys> another thing, I have many divs in the same page, each div with own <a class="t-icon t-refresh" ...>, I just one to trigger the click of the a link in one div only..is this correct? $(div#divIdentifier).find("a.t-icon.t-refresh").trigger.. ?
[06:52:35] <Trisox> read that
[06:53:33] <Trisox> uhh edusys ?
[06:53:38] <wpsmith> Trisox, if u open the inspect tool, it will work, so your inspect tool must not change the height for the scrollbar to appear. if scrollbar doesn't appear, images don't load??
[06:54:03] <Trisox> no it works fine
[06:54:06] <Trisox> ill try safari
[06:54:24] <flu1> may anyone help me by an extending plugin prob? -> http://www.pastie.org/3961051

[06:55:17] <Trisox>  $(document).ready(function () {     setTimeout(function(){         $("#one a").trigger('click');     }, 3000); });   ...
[06:55:17] <edusys> I just want to "click" <a> from div id two for example
[06:55:26] <Trisox>  $(document).ready(function () {     setTimeout(function(){         $("#two a").trigger('click');     }, 3000); });   ...
[06:55:39] <ezio> can anyone tell me a way to prevent select and keypress from both being fired?
[06:55:39] <edusys> great!! thank you :D
[06:55:42] <Trisox> might work.. no idea ;) never tried that
[06:55:54] <edusys> ohh ok, I'll try heh
[06:55:57] <wpsmith> Trisox I wish I had ur system but in Chrome, it's not working
[06:56:09] <Trisox> let me check in chrome one sec
[06:56:31] <wpsmith> Trisox, I appreciate you taking a minute to help
[06:56:32] <Trisox> works fine m8
[06:56:39] <Trisox> clear you cache!
[06:57:08] <wpsmith> Trisox I cleared everything and that's what's causing the issue
[06:57:17] <Trisox> wpsmith: you do wish you had latest version my mac book pro with ssd and 8gb ram :P
[06:57:28] <wpsmith> :)
[06:57:29] <wpsmith> awesome
[06:57:53] <wpsmith> cache cleared
[06:57:57] <Trisox> so it works now?
[06:58:00] <wpsmith> hard refresh via CTRL F5
[06:58:01] <wpsmith> no
[06:58:23] <Trisox> weird..
[06:58:31] <wpsmith> totally
[06:58:36] <wpsmith> also apparent in Safari
[06:58:42] <Trisox> it worked on all browser @ my laptop
[06:58:50] <wpsmith> interesting
[06:59:08] <wpsmith> I'm on Windows
[06:59:13] <Trisox> edusys: test http://69.194.226.50/~foliocfr/ does the lazy loading work?
[06:59:15] <wpsmith> maybe that's the issue (besides the obvious)
[06:59:23] <Trisox> :p
[06:59:49] <MacroMan> How do I get the current scrolled position with $(window).scroll(function(){ var containg new scroll position here }); ?
[06:59:57] <wpsmith> added a console message and the function is being fired
[07:00:08] <MacroMan> Couldn't find it in the docs
[07:01:04] <edusys> Trisox: what should I test in that page? hehe
[07:01:22] <Trisox> scroll to the right
[07:01:32] <MacroMan> I want an element to move based on where the page is scrolled to. (using the css position: fixed; isn't an option)
[07:01:34] <wpsmith> edusys do the 2 images appear?
[07:01:44] <edusys> I have a long horizontal scroll, when I scroll is a loading animation then appears the images
[07:01:46] <wpsmith> without doing anything
[07:02:16] <wpsmith> correct edusys clear cache, refresh
[07:02:22] <edusys> I have two two one two one one
[07:02:24] <wpsmith> doing nothing images don't appear correct?
[07:03:08] <shoky_> MacroMan: you can get it with .scrollTop()
[07:03:36] <MacroMan> shoky_: On window? Like this: $(window).scrollTop(); ?
[07:03:36] <mansour> what is the equevalent of load for a page ? I am recieving a DIV from the server, and I want to modify it, after it's rendered, NOT when the dom is constucted as in .ready()
[07:03:43] <shoky_> MacroMan: i think so
[07:03:50] <Trisox> MacroMan: wants someting like this i think
[07:03:50] <Trisox> http://dentsunetwork.com/#/projects
[07:03:56] <MacroMan> shoky_: OK. I'll give it a go, thanks
[07:04:16] <edusys> wpsmith: without doing anything I have scroll bar and imagetwo imagetwo
[07:04:35] <wpsmith> did u clear ur cache?
[07:04:47] <Trisox> he didnt see the page before so ;)
[07:04:57] <Trisox> mansour: ?on
[07:05:01] <Trisox> ?on
[07:05:01] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:05:16] <Trisox> or is it not event based?
[07:05:29] <MacroMan> Trisox: Yes, that's the kind of thing. I've found .scrollTop() in the manual and it does what I want. Thanks
[07:05:53] <mansour> Trisox: thanx
[07:06:02] <edusys> wpsmith: yes, if I scroll slowly appears imageone, if I scroll fast "loading appears" and then the imageone, etc
[07:06:47] <Trisox> ;)
[07:06:51] <ezio> can anyone tell me a way to prevent select and keypress from both being fired? ... http://jsfiddle.net/fDs7q/7/
[07:07:41] <edusys> Trisox: setTimeout is like a delay right? is setInternal for automatically click after the same period?
[07:08:15] <wpsmith> Trisox, edusys can u guys try out http://foliowebsites.com/example/fresh/
[07:08:20] <wpsmith> don't scroll
[07:08:24] <wpsmith> do the images appear?
[07:08:28] <edusys> ok
[07:08:58] <shoky_> nope
[07:09:12] <edusys> I see the girl, the wedding and blank space
[07:09:18] <wpsmith> shoky_ that's the problem
[07:09:26] <wpsmith> I don't even get the girl
[07:09:31] <wpsmith> ha

[07:38:55] <NodeX> anyone know a nice lightweight datepicker for jquery - perhaps one that degrades with html5 ?
[07:41:00] <stenno|work> jquery-ui datepickre
[07:41:20] <NodeX> I said lightweight lol
[07:41:30] <stenno|work> it is lightweight, lol
[07:41:43] <stenno|work> its highly customizable
[07:41:48] <stenno|work> so you can use what you want there
[07:41:54] <stenno|work> add or remove anything
[07:42:06] <stenno|work> also html5? did you think of anything specific?
[07:42:25] <stenno|work> do you want to paint the picker on canvas? :D
[07:44:47] <xec_> stenno|work: i think he means <input type=date>
[07:45:06] <hlveheart> Hey guys, how would I remove an a tag, that lives above an image with a class of say, .apple? ( HTML is output like this: <a href="targethere.com"> <img src="/apple.png" class="apple" /></a>
[07:45:15] <hlveheart> I want to get rid of the a element completely
[07:45:16] <hlveheart> lol
[07:45:28] <xec_> stenno|work: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#date-state-%28type=date%29
[07:46:00] <xec_> hlveheart: but you want to keep the image?
[07:46:03] <hlveheart> yep
[07:46:51] <xec_> you'd need to move the outside first, and then you can do a simple .remove()
[07:46:56] <xec_> the image*
[07:46:58] <hlveheart> img has an onclick, IE ignores it becasuse the a tag is there. and the HTML is dynamically generated by my jQuery (and I don't want to go through and recode this entire gallery.
[07:47:07] <NodeX> i dont call 93kb minifies lightweight
[07:47:12] <NodeX> minified
[07:47:33] <hlveheart> so, ('.apple > a').remove ?
[07:47:35] <stenno|work> xec_ well this has not really something to do with a date_picker_, no?
[07:47:37] <hlveheart> something like that?
[07:47:43] <stenno|work> its just where the result is saved
[07:47:53] <stenno|work> and ofc you can use jquery-ui custom stuff to do that
[07:48:03] <stenno|work> to show the result in <input type=date
[07:48:09] <xec_> stenno|work: <input type=date> is a datepicker in supporting browsers
[07:48:12] <MacroMan> $('#basket').css('top'); This will give me something like '420px'. Is there a way to get this numerically rather than a string with 'px' in it?
[07:48:16] <stenno|work> ooh i see
[07:48:23] <stenno|work> i thought it would just 'validate' the format
[07:48:25] <MacroMan> Without running it through a regex
[07:48:43] <xec_> hlveheart: not quite
[07:48:49] <Connorhd> MacroMan: parseInt($('#basket').css('top'), 10) ?
[07:48:52] <hlveheart> would I use .parent in this case?
[07:49:35] <MacroMan> parseInt?
[07:49:36] <NodeX> ok, anyone else know a nice lightweight datepicker - perhaps that degrades form html5
[07:49:37] <xec_> hlveheart: in your case you could prevent bubbling to stop the browser from following the link
[07:49:38] <NodeX> from *
[07:50:11] <hlveheart> bubbling?
[07:50:14] <fikhool> any niggers in there?
[07:50:18] <hlveheart> >:/
[07:50:22] <MacroMan> Connorhd: Thanks. Looks good
[07:50:28] <niko> fikhool: drop it
[07:50:28] <hlveheart> fikhool, grow up
[07:50:32] <stenno|work> fikhool, lol fuck off retard
[07:51:00] <NodeX> racism is not cool
[07:51:07] <NodeX> it's not mature either
[07:51:18] <xec_> where's your humor, slavery is all fun and jokes
[07:51:19] <shoky_> screw racism, that's trollism
[07:51:25] <stenno|work> my hobby is to bash racists in the face
[07:51:28] <hlveheart> wait a sec. xec, couldn't I do something like $('.apple").unwrap();
[07:51:29] <hlveheart> o_O?
[07:51:38] <stenno|work> and lick their blood and so on
[07:51:44] <NodeX> Apple MAC's cuck -true story
[07:51:47] <stenno|work> nice
[07:51:53] <stenno|work> k-line the fucker
[07:51:54] <NodeX> cuck -> suck
[07:51:55] <hlveheart> stenno|work, that's kinda counterproductive
[07:51:57] <hlveheart> lol
[07:52:05] <hlveheart> fighting anger with anger.
[07:52:06] <hlveheart> <_>
[07:52:11] <MacroMan> stenno|work: That's abit messed up. Drinking blood????
[07:52:23] <stenno|work> MacroMan, that part was kidding
[07:52:31] <MacroMan> stenno|work: Guessed that lol
[07:53:03] <xec_> hlveheart: yes that could work too, but you should really learn about javascript events and what propagation/bubbling is
[07:54:09] <hlveheart> I'll probably just recode this gallery if this concept gets passed from my boss, I was just taking the easy way out
[07:54:14] <StyxLT> hi fellows, I saw that jQuery live is now deprecated and I'm supposed to use on method, but how would I change the code from $("a[data-action=delete]").live('click',function(){}); to the on method?
[07:54:32] <stenno|work> change live with on...
[07:54:45] <shoky_> nuh
[07:54:46] <xec_> lol
[07:54:51] <StyxLT> but that doesn't work, cause i need the 3rd parameter to be the selector
[07:54:58] <xec_> stenno|work: that was less than helpful :)
[07:55:03] <StyxLT> so what does the 1st selector should be?
[07:55:08] <StyxLT> what would*
[07:55:19] <stenno|work> huh
[07:55:23] <shoky_> StyxLT: $(document).on('click', 'a[data-action=delete]', function() { ... } )
[07:55:29] <shoky_> that is what .live() does
[07:55:53] <StyxLT> that didnt work for me on dynamically inserted dom elements
[07:55:53] <stenno|work> thats awful :<
[07:55:57] <shoky_> as the docs say
[07:56:01] <shoky_> awful?
[07:56:03] <xec_> StyxLT: what shoky_ said would mimic live() exactly, but it's better to find the closest permanent ancestor and select on that instead of document
[07:56:06] <shoky_> that's .live()
[07:56:18] <stenno|work> well i mean the syntax
[07:56:24] <stenno|work> why not make $(elem).on ?
[07:56:27] <shoky_> what's awful about it
[07:56:31] <stenno|work> just like $(elem).live
[07:56:35] <shoky_> because that wouldn't work for elements that are not in the DOM yet
[07:56:42] <xec_> stenno|work: .on() is not the same as .live() dude
[07:56:43] <shoky_> that would be just like .bind()
[07:57:05] <stenno|work> and why did they drop .live and made it just more ugly?
[07:57:17] <xec_> StyxLT: and then you would pass a filter as second argument
[07:57:18] <shoky_> because .live always picks the document as the event handler
[07:57:22] <shoky_> and that is not a good idea
[07:57:29] <stenno|work> i think i understand
[07:57:32] <StyxLT> oh now i see
[07:57:34] <hlveheart> does IE ignore unwrap?
[07:57:35] <hlveheart> o_O
[07:57:56] <shoky_> no
[07:58:10] <hlveheart> it is on my end
[07:58:13] <hlveheart> u_u
[07:58:17] <NodeX> it might if it's bad html or unclosed tags
[07:58:33] <NodeX> firefox for example will try and fix unclosed tags
[07:58:43] <NodeX> IE : not so much
[07:58:59] <hlveheart> still, no elements being removed lol
[07:59:11] <StyxLT> xec_: thanks it worked,
[07:59:18] <hlveheart> ah wait
[07:59:23] <hlveheart> does IE not get along with .load?
[07:59:34] <hlveheart> er
[07:59:34] <hlveheart>             $(window).load(function () {
[07:59:59] <xec_> iirc you can't rely on .load() always being fired
[08:00:11] <xec_> for some reason i forget
[08:00:38] <hlveheart> well, when I was trying to use $(document).ready(), it wasn't waiting for the entire page to finish loading
[08:00:40] <hlveheart> ;/
[08:01:13] <xec_> what were you waiting for?
[08:01:53] <xec_> all the dom elements should be present, but images haven't loaded yet if that's what you mean
[08:02:02] <hlveheart> basically, this gallery loads content from an XML, outputs icons.
[08:02:13] <poppiez> when I do: var test = $.get('/testurl'); $.when(test).then(doStuff); function doStuff(data) { console.log(data); } `data` is an array of the response, "success", object with readyState and responseText. is it true I have to do resp[0] to get the data?
[08:02:28] <xec_> hlveheart: this is done via some javascript method?
[08:02:33] <hlveheart> ye
[08:03:42] <xec_> hlveheart: then you should run whatever script depending on this content after it's loaded
[08:04:30] <xec_> poppiez: what happens if you do test.done(doStuff)
[08:05:24] <poppiez> xec_: the same: the response is an array
[08:05:35] <DerekPioneer> jQuery('#tooltip').tooltip()   only tooltips() the last instance of #tooltip
[08:05:39] <DerekPioneer> why won't it to do all?
[08:06:23] <hlveheart> Instead of $(window).load(function () {, how can you make it fireoff once it sees that an image is loaded?
[08:06:24] <hlveheart> o_O
[08:06:29] <DerekPioneer> why won't it do it to all?*
[08:07:21] <xec_> DerekPioneer: IDs are unique identifiers, you can only have one #tooltip on a page
[08:07:38] <xec_> DerekPioneer: you want a class, you can have any number of .tooltip
[08:07:57] <DerekPioneer> omg i finally understand the difference a class and an id
[08:08:03] <DerekPioneer> ty xec_
[08:08:04] <xec_> :D
[08:08:06] <xec_> yw
[08:09:15] <Lucky--> wtf? http://jsfiddle.net/L9sC3/2/
[08:10:03] <shoky_> ?
[08:10:26] <Lucky--> why dont i get my state names back?
[08:10:26] <xec_> Lucky--: care to elaborate?
[08:11:13] <xec_> wth is kendo.template()?
[08:11:20] <Lucky--> LOL
[08:11:23] <Lucky--> i think i see it
[08:11:25] <NoiseEee> Lucky--: http://jsfiddle.net/L9sC3/3/
[08:11:40] <Lucky--> err no i dont
[08:12:10] <Lucky--> NoiseEee: shouldnt a template auto iterate through it?
[08:12:15] <NoiseEee> usStates is an array
[08:12:25] <NoiseEee> Lucky--: beats me i have no idea
[08:12:49] <NoiseEee> i think its going to be up to you to iterate, i always thought kendo was barbies boyfriend
[08:13:05] <xec_> no that is ken, d'oh!
[08:13:47] <poppiez> xec_: any thoughts?
[08:14:16] <xec_> poppiez: yes. i'm thinking it's really hot in here and i want some ice cream.
[08:14:43] <xec_> oh about your issue? no, sorry. make a demo? or buy me an ice cream? :)
[08:15:28] <xec_> Lucky--, NoiseEee: i found this but it looks extremely lacking.. am i looking at the wrong place? http://demos.kendoui.com/web/templates/index.html
[08:16:23] <poppiez> xec_: here you go buddy: http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/24000000/ice-cream-Yummy-ice-cream-24070264-360-380.jpg
[08:16:23] <xec_> Lucky--: http://www.sitefinitysteve.com/blog/code/2012/05/03/debugging-a-kendo-template-loop maybe useful?
[08:16:50] <Lucky--> let me see
[08:16:58] <Lucky--> ah
[08:17:02] <Lucky--> this isnt like jquery templates
[08:17:03] <Lucky--> gay
[08:17:35] <hlveheart> So..
[08:17:53] <xec_> poppiez: oh god that is torture =(
[08:18:12] <xec_> looks soooo delicious
[08:18:16] <hlveheart> What happens when both, $(document).ready(function() {, and $(window).load(function() {, fire off too early?
[08:18:30] <Lucky--> .ready wont fire till the dom is ready
[08:18:32] <pachet> can you quantify 'too early'
[08:18:34] <Lucky--> .load will run immediately
[08:18:46] <hlveheart> They're both alerting before the XML is fully loaded.
[08:18:47] <hlveheart> o_o
[08:18:52] <xec_> Lucky--: that's not correct
[08:19:13] <xec_> Lucky--: window load is after dom ready and images are loaded iirc
[08:19:19] <shoky_> o shit ice cream
[08:19:21] <IfSixWasNine> xec_ right
[08:20:09] <xec_> IfSixWasNineWhatWouldNineBe: ty
[08:20:23] <hlveheart> xec_, so to avoid me having to redo this entire gallery just for a concept to show my boss...
[08:20:39] <hlveheart> What can I do to make sure the image is loaded on the page before this code executes?
[08:21:13] <hlveheart> Like I said, I just want to avoid having to rip the entire gallery apart in order to show my boss a concept lol
[08:21:19] <hlveheart> that just seems like a foolish waste of time
[08:21:33] <xec_> hlveheart: depends on the "this code" really, does it supply a method to fire a callback when it's done? or fire an event perhaps? if not you might need to hack it up manually
[08:21:47] <xec_> but, the thing is
[08:21:53] <hlveheart> in Firefox/chrome, the window load function works just fine.
[08:21:54] <hlveheart> ;/
[08:21:58] <xec_> you probably DO NOT have to remove the anchors!
[08:22:18] <hlveheart> xec_, I have other functions other thanremoving the anchors
[08:22:18] <hlveheart> lol
[08:22:28] <xec_> most likely you can just do preventDefault on the event object
[08:22:30] <hlveheart> I have an addclass, a few click functions.
[08:22:48] <hlveheart> tried preventdefault already
[08:23:54] <xec_> hlveheart: i see... well, there's not much we can do without knowing exactly what is going on
[08:24:16] <hlveheart> Hmph.
[08:24:38] <xec_> and i need to get out of here and get som ice cream. now.
[08:24:48] <xec_> good luck! :)

[08:34:01] <JuJuBee> What am I doing wrong here ? http://jsfiddle.net/M6yeg/9/  I can't seem to capture the submit of the form.
[08:35:59] <johnkpaul> JuJuBee: the . selector is for class
[08:36:05] <johnkpaul> you want $("#myForm")
[08:36:15] <johnkpaul> ?g selectutorial @ JuJuBee
[08:36:16] <bot-t> JuJuBee, Selectutorial: CSS selectors - http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/

[08:37:25] <silur> Hello
[08:38:22] <silur> Q: I have a page of text. Is it possible to "get" which word is at x+y pixel coordinate?
[08:38:49] <silur> or rather which element falls at x+y coordinate?
[08:40:03] <TeckniX> I'm having trouble with the 'has' selector - Anyone can tell me what I'm doing wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/6wfsJ/
[08:40:24] <TeckniX> silur: you could have spans, and get the x/y of the span for the word
[08:41:04] <TeckniX> silur: otherwise it'll have to be approximative to the closest element position and where in the sentence the word was found
[08:41:19] <stefan4> Q: Loading remote data with jquery in it. Anyway I can use the existing loaded jquery and not load it again? here is what I want to do: http://jsfiddle.net/kEf6M/5/ . In order to get it to work at the moment I have to add code in the somestring to load a whole new instance of jquery by adding it to the meta tag.
[08:41:56] <silur> TeckniX, Yes i can find x+y of span given the selector span. But given x+y - can i find span that falls in it?
[08:42:12] <mikey625> Good day everyone.
[08:42:23] <stefan4> window.jQuery from inside .html() returns undefined.
[08:43:05] <TeckniX> silur: you may have to build an array of elements on the page and just find the closest one based on x+y
[08:43:24] <mikey625> anyone ever have any issues with jquery actually being rendered as html in webkit? I keep looking for an open html tag as the culprit but I can't see it.
[08:43:49] <silur> TeckniX, thanks, yeah
[08:45:12] <mansour> I asked this question few hours ago, I got an answer, but after searching couldn't solve the issue. I am recieving a div using $.ajax and need to load it, render it, then modify some values in the new contents.
[08:45:31] <mansour> .ready processes it before rendering.
[08:45:44] <mansour> I need something else.
[08:46:03] <johnkpaul> mansour: what do you mean "processes it before rendering"?
[08:46:05] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ mansour
[08:46:06] <bot-t> mansour, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:46:17] <stefan4> This works, http://jsfiddle.net/kEf6M/8/ but not in jsfiddle. Would prefer a not loading jquery again.
[08:46:22] <JuJuBee> johnkpaul: it seems that if I put a submit button in then I can use .submit but  .submit doesn't catch the onChange ... submit() from the selection list?
[08:46:45] <Xoke> so I'm having problems doing a warning on unsaved changes.  If I click quickly to leave the page then the message comes up, but if I let the page load fully then I don't get a message
[08:46:54] <mansour> johnkpaul: the event is triggered after the DOM is loaded in the memory.
[08:47:01] <johnkpaul> JuJuBee: changing a selectbox isn't the submit event
[08:47:09] <johnkpaul> ?change @ JuJuBee
[08:47:09] <Xoke> I believe I have conflicting functions that one loads first and gives the message then the other overwrites but was looking for confirmation
[08:47:09] <bot-t> JuJuBee, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[08:47:24] <johnkpaul> mansour: what event?
[08:48:43] <mansour> johnkpaul: http://api.jquery.com/ready/ give you an idea about the difference between  "load" and .ready(). I need something similar to load, but for the recieved DIV and in jquery way.
[08:49:06] <johnkpaul> mansour: I know the difference, I'm wondering more what you are trying to do
[08:49:36] <mansour> johnkpaul: I need to modify the dom, after it's rendered.
[08:50:02] <mansour> .read fire the attached event before the page is rendered.
[08:50:12] <mansour> I hope this clarifies the issue.
[08:51:43] <johnkpaul> mansour: no, it does not
[08:51:55] <johnkpaul> after the dom is rendered, you want to fire an event
[08:52:12] <mansour> after it's rendered.
[08:52:24] <johnkpaul> mansour:  $(document).ready(function(){//.trigger() your event})
[08:52:54] <mansour> what is the // ??
[08:53:33] <johnkpaul> mansour: a comment, put whatever code you want there
[08:53:41] <mansour> .ready triggers before the page is rendered !
[08:53:58] <mansour> ok, johnkpaul I really appreciate your help.
[08:54:25] <Xoke> $(window).bind('beforeunload', function(){return "Something";}); should ALWAYS kick up a message on leaving the page (well, dependant on the browser and how you close etc etc), right?
[08:56:34] <Lucky--> switched to jqurey templates, i can alert this but cant seem to append it: http://jsfiddle.net/L9sC3/16/
[08:59:55] <hlveheart> question
[09:00:06] <hlveheart> instead of document ready, or window load, can you just create a timer?
[09:00:12] <hlveheart> Really stupid question, I'm sure
[09:00:35] <hlveheart> but IE9 isn't waiting until my page is ready, and all my iamges are loaded in the DOM, but IE8, and IE7 wait just fine
[09:00:38] <hlveheart> it's really kinda stupid.
[09:00:59] <hlveheart> images*
[09:02:16] <brettfrable> How much do you think a web designer should be making his first year in upstate, ny. Responsibilities including the web design, the mark up including html5, css/css3 , js, php
[09:02:42] <mnewton> Hey guys, can I store a json object in my namespace using getJson? Here's the pastebin - http://pastebin.com/Q64P0bHG
[09:03:04] <hlveheart> brettfrable, I do much more than just that, and I don't make 50k a year.
[09:03:35] <brettfrable> whys that
[09:03:42] <hlveheart> because I'm underpaid, and need to work
[09:03:43] <hlveheart> lol
[09:03:53] <hlveheart> I don't know really
[09:04:09] <brettfrable> where do you live
[09:04:15] <hlveheart> Northern Massachusetts
[09:04:35] <brettfrable> hm
[09:04:37] <Xoke> brettfrable: salary.com will give you an idea, but I've never been paid what it says I should get paid lol
[09:04:47] <brettfrable> I'm getting a 30k offer
[09:04:53] <silverwind> hlveheart, If you were in Montreal, you'd have a low salary.
[09:04:58] <brettfrable> and its insulting
[09:04:58] <silverwind> (At 50k$)
[09:05:19] <Xoke> there is also the argument of having a job and earning SOMETHING that is better then nothing
[09:05:22] <silverwind> 45k$ is junior here.
[09:05:23] <hlveheart> brettfrable, yeah, i mean, if you have the oppertunity to hunt around more for a better paying job, all the power to you
[09:05:38] <silverwind> Xoke, Then... just get hired at wallmart
[09:05:48] <hlveheart> silverwind, that's not what he's saying
[09:05:58] <brettfrable> i mean 5 years exp i should make more money right
[09:05:59] <hlveheart> he's saying, don't be greedy. which is completely reasonable
[09:05:59] <hlveheart> lol
[09:06:13] <silverwind> hlveheart, well.. being underpaid sucks.
[09:06:17] <hlveheart> you're telling me
[09:06:29] <silverwind> hlveheart, It's not good for you and even for them...
[09:06:39] <hlveheart> well, for them, sure it is
[09:06:53] <silverwind> hlveheart, Because at that price, you will feel that they don't give a shit about you and you'll be demotivated.
[09:07:01] <hlveheart> well, that too, yeah
[09:07:06] <hlveheart> that goes back to work ethics tho
[09:07:19] <hlveheart> i don't do a poor job if I don't think I'm being underpaid, that's just immature
[09:07:33] <keirlav87> if i have an object that contains multiple html options, how can i append that to a select?
[09:07:46] <brettfrable> idk
[09:07:50] <silverwind> hlveheart, neither I... but don't expect me to do more than required.
[09:07:56] <hlveheart> oh for sure
[09:07:58] <brettfrable> I'm okay  with starting at that
[09:07:58] <shoky_> mnewton: yea you can do that...
[09:08:05] <keirlav87> when i try $('#select').append(options) i get this error =>Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentFragment.appendChild]
[09:08:10] <hlveheart> I didn't get a big raise this year, I stopped staying late
[09:08:11] <hlveheart> lol
[09:08:48] <hlveheart> I was working like 70-75 hours for weeks during our busy time last year, and I was slapped in the face with a 3% raise.
[09:08:54] <brettfrable> but but idk if i should get in another field
[09:08:56] <hlveheart> I'm salary though, so I mean, I guess it's expected
[09:09:03] <shoky_> keirlav87:  what is options ?
[09:09:08] <hlveheart> but fuck that, not lstaying late anymore
[09:09:08] <hlveheart> lol
[09:09:10] <brettfrable> or if i can expect a good sal 5 years into it
[09:09:19] <mnewton> shoky_, okay - so how do I save the data to my namespace?
[09:09:40] <silverwind> hlveheart, Haha, same for me :D
[09:09:43] <mnewton> shoky_,  I tried trolloSpace.levels = data; but when it goes out of scope - i get nothing
[09:09:46] <mnewton> undefined
[09:09:53] <hlveheart> :P
[09:10:02] <brettfrable> what do you guys think
[09:10:05] <silverwind> hlveheart, At least, my overtime was paid.
[09:10:13] <hlveheart> silverwind, lucky you
[09:10:14] <hlveheart> lol
[09:10:22] <silverwind> :P
[09:10:26] <yedimind> there are plenty of people out there that make good money doing front end development
[09:11:02] <hlveheart> brettfrable, if you can live off the 30k offer, and aren't going to be struggling, and have bills to pay, by all means, take it and if you don't see your salary change signifigantly in a year or so, move on and look for a new base
[09:11:03] <hlveheart> ;o
[09:11:16] <yedimind> brettfrable, you have a portfolio?
[09:11:20] <shoky_> mnewton: you're probably trying to access it before the ajax request is responded..
[09:12:09] <brettfrable> working on it - www.brettfrable.com
[09:12:12] <karl_heinz> can I dynamically add a hidden input field with jquery
[09:12:21] <shoky_> karl_heinz: sure
[09:12:40] <c1yd3i_> Anyone know how to embed a PHP page/script into a jQuery modal?
[09:12:40] <yedimind> brettfrable, move to toronto, i'll give you a 50k sallary
[09:12:41] <yedimind> :)
[09:12:55] <brettfrable> haha seriously
[09:13:11] <yedimind> partially, yes
[09:13:15] <yedimind> we are hiring
[09:13:22] <yedimind> but id have to see a lot more than a splash page
[09:14:01] <c1yd3i_> Anyone!>
[09:14:19] <brettfrable> company?
[09:14:42] <brettfrable> i might take you up on this - i love toronto
[09:14:45] <yedimind> www.bnotions.com
[09:15:07] <yedimind> im not a huge fan of the site personally
[09:16:34] <brettfrable> It's nice.
[09:16:34] <Altreus> is it expected that if I .append(some_obj), and some_obj has an event handler, that the handler will be preserved?
[09:16:43] <Xoke> silverwind: if it's a choice between no job and a low paid job (but more then walmart) was what I meant
[09:16:49] <pachet> its kind of scrolly-y
[09:16:57] <Xoke> besides it's always easier to get a job if you already have one
[09:17:12] <shoky_> Altreus: yes
[09:17:22] <Altreus> shoky_: thought so. thanks, I'll keep hacking :)
[09:17:28] <yedimind> brettfrable, also www.pud.ca is me personally
[09:17:34] <Xoke> so does anyone know why my $(window).bind('beforeunload', function(){return "Something";}); isn't working? lol
[09:18:54] <NoiseEee> Xoke: use "on"
[09:19:18] <Xoke> onbeforeunload?  I tried that too lol, having similar results that it only sometimes works
[09:19:36] <NoiseEee> $(window).on('beforeunload',function() { //etc });
[09:19:55] <brettfrable> yedimind, that's awesome. Is it fair to say I can take you at least partially serious, and send you some stuff?
[09:20:08] <Altreus> can I find out what event handlers are on a node?
[09:20:35] <Xoke> NoiseEee: ahhh ok cheers :)
[09:20:48] <shoky_> Altreus: $(node).data('events')  but it's undocumented
[09:20:58] <Altreus> shoky_: cheers - just for debugging :)
[09:21:01] <keirlav87> is there a way to execute a function on the last iteration of a .each loop?
[09:22:03] <Xoke> NoiseEee: nope, same problem.  If I let the page fully load it doesn't work but if I click faster it does work
[09:22:06] <shoky_> keirlav87: yeah but it'd be clumsy. what are you after?
[09:22:44] <NoiseEee> Xoke: if you what now?
[09:23:05] <keirlav87> im appending data sent back from server to populate a select, once all the options have been appended i'd like to remove my ajax loading gif
[09:23:19] <shoky_> then why not do it after the .each ?
[09:23:41] <keirlav87> yeah that makes sense :P think all this sun has melted my brain
[09:23:45] <shoky_> ;P
[09:25:46] <Xoke> NoiseEee: so the page takes a few seconds to load - it's in test and it's this computer.  Anyway if I let the page part load and click to leave the page I get the 'are you sure' message.  If I let the page fully load I don't get the message
[09:27:04] <NoiseEee> Xoke: sounds strange, jsfiddle if you can, otherwise sounds like maybe something is cancelling the event on page load
[09:27:58] <Xoke> NoiseEee: that was my guess too but I don't know what... will look at jsfiddle though and try to figure it out.  Thanks :)
[09:28:51] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how I apply an equivilant (or just succesfully apply) overflow-y: hiddden; to a <td> so I can .animate it?
[09:28:54] <Xoke> NoiseEee: not sure I can put all the code up but will try to trim it down :)
[09:29:06] <Xoke> just been given another project so have to do that for a bit though lol
[09:32:05] <mansour> After ajax call it is getting very slow. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/BSwPF/1/
[09:33:17] <NoiseEee> what's very slow? the alert box?
[09:33:56] <johnline3> $('.hovertext').hide().html($(this).text('b').stop(true, true).fadeIn(400);
[09:34:12] <johnline3> i am trying to carry out this operation on this line:
[09:34:13] <mansour> NoiseEee: yes.
[09:34:17] <NoiseEee> also you should do: var xhr = $.ajax(etc);    xhr.done(function(data) { console.log(data); });
[09:34:17] <johnline3> <a class="prj01 fade2" href="emirati-expressions.php" rel="Emirati Expressions"><b>Emirati Expressions</b> contemporary art gallery at the Emirates Palace Abu Dhabi</a>
[09:34:24] <johnline3> any idea where i am going wrong?
[09:34:26] <NoiseEee> mansour: how can an alert box be 'slow'
[09:34:27] <mansour> it doesn't get called
[09:34:43] <mansour> NoiseEee: it's slow getting to the alert box.
[09:35:16] <muka> console.log ?
[09:35:21] <mansour> even if I removed it, firebird shows it's still processing the request
[09:35:57] <mansour> which is what I don't understand. The server sent the response immediately.
[09:36:39] <NoiseEee> mansour: i can;t imagine why unless you've got JS stuff going on in the meantime
[09:36:46] <NoiseEee> ie: between your XHR call and the response
[09:36:58] <mansour> NoiseEee: this is a possibility,
[09:37:16] <mansour> I will disable everything else, completely to see if this is the issue.
[09:37:30] <NoiseEee> yeah i mean don't forget, even though its async its also single threaded
[09:40:29] <mansour> NoiseEee: this is good tip. Thank you
[09:40:35] <NoiseEee> np
[09:41:06] <johnline3> attr() reads alt,rel,title tag
[09:41:44] <johnline3> what can i use to read basic text between <a> this text</a> tags
[09:42:35] <NoiseEee> johnline3: html() or text(), depending on what you want
[09:42:53] <johnline3> thanks NoiseEee
[09:42:59] <NoiseEee> np
[09:43:47] <johnline3> now between those <a> tags i want to read the <b>'s, like this  <a><b>read this</b></a>
[09:44:23] <johnline3> $('.hovertext').hide().html($(this).text()).stop(true, true).fadeIn(400);
[09:44:23] <johnline3> i have this so far
[09:45:22] <mikey625> read the b's?
[09:46:15] <johnline3> ye plz
[09:46:40] <mikey625> what is your final outcome objective visually
[09:46:56] <mikey625> fade it into bold?
[09:47:16] <johnline3> <a class="prj01 fade2" href="emirati-expressions.php"><b>Emirati Expressions</b> contemporary art gallery at the Emirates Palace Abu Dhabi</a>
[09:47:23] <johnline3> heres an example line its reading from
[09:47:52] <johnline3> so i just want to return the text inside the bold tags, the rest is there for seo
[09:48:32] <keirlav87> when you make an ajax call in firebug the grey ms next to the request is that the total time or the time until the success function is fired?
[09:48:42] <auska> Hi! I need a function on jquery that given the number, round it. So, given the number: 22.348779454568 return 22.34
[09:48:44] <auska> any idea?
[09:49:19] <NoiseEee> auska: javascript.  toFixed()
[09:49:34] <FiveFingerDeathP> that's like the twentieth person to ask that today
[09:51:05] <mariuscc> anyone using phpDesigner.. the ide ?
[09:51:39] <karl_heinz> I want to submit disabled fields. I use jquery to remove disabled attributes before for submit, works fine. When the user goes back, (without refreshing/using cached copy), the disabled field is now enabled for the user. If they refreshed, visiblityCheck() will disable it again if select box value is '0'. What can I do?
[09:52:22] <jedimind> disabled fields still submit ...
[09:52:34] <jedimind> you dont have to change their state before submitting
[09:52:55] <jedimind> oh i lied
[09:52:56] <jedimind> nevermind
[09:53:16] <jedimind> simple method would be to have hidden fields with those values in them
[09:53:39] <NoiseEee> karl_heinz: redirect the user on form submission to new form / take away the back
[09:53:53] <jedimind> karl_heinz, either that or set the inputs as readonly instead of disabled
[09:54:14] <karl_heinz> jedimind: no, they don't submit
[09:54:24] <jedimind> yeah, youre right, i forgot they dont
[09:54:29] <jedimind> but the rest of what i said is valid
[09:54:41] <karl_heinz> jedimind: readonly is fine, but not applicable to select boxes
[09:54:45] <karl_heinz> that's my main hangup
[09:55:04] <karl_heinz> soemtimes the textfields will be pre-filled & read-only for the user, and sometimes not
[09:57:13] <NoiseEee> so use a hidden form field for the select value, disable the options themselves, etc / solve as you wish
[10:01:30] <karl_heinz> NoiseEee: thanks for the idea
[10:03:41] <johnline3> http://www.exhibitiondesign.com/temp/index.php
[10:03:44] <jedimind> NoiseEee, IDEA STEALER
[10:03:45] <jedimind> lol
[10:03:56] <hlveheart> boom.
[10:04:00] * hlveheart slaps hlveheart around a bit with a large trout
[10:04:09] <NoiseEee> ;_;
[10:04:10] <johnline3> heres the page, i am nearly there, except it is returning the whole text string inside <a>, not inside <b>
[10:12:16] <hlveheart> How would you fade this function?
[10:12:17] <hlveheart> $(".AppImg").attr('src', "/images/apps/acctivate.png");
[10:12:18] <hlveheart> o_O
[10:13:06] <hlveheart> I have like 6 items that change when you click, and am planning on doing this with 15 or so items
[10:13:22] <hlveheart> would it better to just layer divs on top of eachother, and have them display:none by default?
[10:14:09] <hlveheart> you have multiple layers of divs sitting on top of eachother, and on click, triggers fadein of said div?
[10:14:11] <hlveheart> o_o
[10:14:36] <hlveheart> so you would have*
[10:15:14] <shoky_> huh
[10:15:23] <hlveheart> i don't know how to word this
[10:15:29] <hlveheart> so it's turning into word vomit
[10:15:33] <shoky_> l0l.
[10:15:58] <hlveheart> basically, I have a div on the right side of these applications icons, when you click an icon, it changes the paragraph text, and image in said right box.
[10:16:15] <shoky_> why not save you and us the trouble of parsing
[10:16:18] <shoky_> and just make a jsfiddle.
[10:16:32] <hlveheart> because I'm asking what would be better, so i can actually code it
[10:16:33] <hlveheart> lol
[10:16:40] <shoky_> hrm
[10:17:02] <hlveheart> one sec. I guess I'll do it this way. One sec.
[10:23:44] <packingtown> in .each function, using $(this), is there any way to target deeper selectors? e.g. $(this.option:eq(0))
[10:25:01] <ddifof> hey guys hows it going? I'm trying to write a jquery plugin and i was wondering if there was a better way to implement methods than the one explained on the plugin page
[10:25:12] <ddifof> is there a way to make it so you can access sub methods by way of
[10:25:20] <ddifof> $.myMethod.mySubMethod()
[10:25:42] <ddifof> and can I maintain global variables that the sub methods can access?
[10:25:45] <dabear> packingtown: huh? $(this) <-- "this" there is not a selector, it's an element
[10:26:35] <dabear> ddifof: $.myMethod.mySubMethod() will work, however, $("foo").myMethod.mySubMethod() would not
[10:26:47] <packingtown> dabear: i know, but once i have a $(this) i'm interested in its option at index 0 and i don't see a way to get it
[10:26:56] <dabear> the last will work, but you wouldn't have access to the contents in foo there
[10:27:21] <packingtown> dabear: i get an error doing $('#' + $(this).id + ' option:eq(0)').text()
[10:28:04] <dabear> packingtown: if you know that "this" refers to a dom element that is also a select, you will have access to this.options
[10:28:39] <packingtown> dabear: awesome, thanks!
[10:29:26] <ddifof> thanks dabear
[10:31:07] <dabear> ddifof: jquery ui solves this by having a "proxy" that calls sub functions and passes along the "this" value
[10:31:43] <darcyclarke> ddifof is this kind of what you wanted to do: http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/6eB6W/ ?
[10:32:13] <dabear> so you have $(foo).bar("baz", "opt1") which really calls a baz function with opt1 and foo as a this value
[10:32:56] <ddifof> ahhh yeah kind of
[10:33:06] <ddifof> i just want a way to encapsulate functions
[10:34:21] <ddifof> darcyclarke: can i access the parent functions variables in the submethod?
[10:34:34] <ddifof> or does this.XXX change to reference the submethod
[10:35:32] <hlveheart> shoky_, you still there?
[10:36:58] <gho5t> would this be vaild:  $('#images').children().click(function(){ ... });
[10:37:03] <gho5t> or do i have ot use .each?
[10:37:06] <ddifof> http://jsfiddle.net/TpyC4/
[10:37:13] <ddifof> like that>
[10:37:44] <ddifof> gho5t: children returns an aray i believe, where each is an iterator
[10:37:45] <catcher> gho5t, you have multiple images that share the id 'images'?
[10:38:02] <darcyclarke> ddifof http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/6eB6W/1/
[10:38:10] <catcher> multiple elements rather
[10:38:15] <gho5t> no
[10:38:23] <gho5t> i have multiple children inside #images
[10:38:49] <catcher> ah, I see.
[10:38:50] <ddifof> awesome
[10:38:51] <thinkt4nk> gho5t that should be valid.  children() should return a jquery wrapped set of the children
[10:38:56] <darcyclarke> ddifof ;)
[10:40:07] <d3f4ultr0> good afternoon folks. How can I display 3 dialog boxes fadein and maybe a gap of 1/4th of a second?
[10:40:16] <gho5t> thinkt4nk: ok thanks
[10:40:18] <ddifof> can i also set it up like
[10:40:20] <ddifof> http://jsfiddle.net/VHzK8/
[10:40:34] <thinkt4nk> np :)
[10:40:39] <ddifof> or does it have to be inside to reference the functions scope
[10:40:40] <zeropx> d3f4ultr0: are you wanting them one after the other or all at once on the screen?
[10:40:57] <_BigWings_> http://www.pasteall.org/32173
[10:41:20] <_BigWings_> the variable 'data' is available in the first line, but it doesn't seem to be available inside of the lick handler
[10:41:31] <_BigWings_> how do I get around this?
[10:42:25] <thinkt4nk> _BigWings_ around what?  is there any code that we're not seeing between lines 1 and 3?
[10:42:49] <thinkt4nk> your closure should have access to everything in scope that you've shown, including data
[10:42:51] <prefixed> ok bros, I'm almost there!
[10:42:53] <prefixed> Ok, so I am having some issues with setting up continuous play for the media players on the following site. I am essentially trying to use a linked-list to manage the continuous functionality; however, I am not 100% sure on how to actually set the next and previous elements in such a manner that will actually work (perhaps by setter helper methods?). Any ideas? SITE: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ CODE http://pastebin.com/Sr72wbM
[10:43:29] <_BigWings_> thinkt4nk: no there is nothing
[10:43:58] <_BigWings_> let me look at it one more time then
[10:44:07] <Guest2294> in jquery how do i limit a .map
[10:44:08] <_BigWings_> 'data' isn't a reserved keyword or something?
[10:44:24] <thinkt4nk> _BigWings_ something may be deleting the object before the handler gets control
[10:44:53] <_BigWings_> eh... let me look
[10:44:54] <thinkt4nk> _BigWings_ no
[10:45:43] <darcyclarke> ddifof you can set it up like this but you loose access to the variables defined in the original method http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/VHzK8/1/
[10:46:11] <catcher> I have an element that starts hidden, but gets displayed with a user action. It overlays, positioned absolutely. Some of my pages aren't tall enough to account for the element, and min-height is not an option.  Any recommendations? dynamically calculate total possible height and resize on page load?
[10:46:28] <d3f4ultr0> i'm back
[10:46:46] <_BigWings_> http://www.pasteall.org/32174
[10:46:51] <d3f4ultr0> one at at time but before the first one completes, the other one starts showing up
[10:46:52] <_BigWings_> thats my entire function
[10:48:28] <_BigWings_> and i get "data[i] is undefined" inside of my click handler
[10:48:38] <thinkt4nk> _BigWings_ you're likely not losing reference to data, but to the member of data that you want
[10:48:44] <thinkt4nk> yeah, hold on
[10:49:23] <monk12> hmmm I copied some  jquery code (simple 3 liner where it serializes a textarea and puts that in a url param)... but the new code puts + between the new lines, while old code(correctly, i think, encodes it as %0D%0A)... what could be the difference why one encodes it as a plus?
[10:50:03] <prefixed> ok, how about this a one:
[10:50:04] <prefixed> I am essentially trying to use a linked-list to manage continuous track playing functionality on the following site; however, I am not 100% sure on how to actually set the next and previous elements in such a manner that will actually work (perhaps by setter helper methods?). Any ideas? SITE: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ CODE http://pastebin.com/Sr72wbMB
[10:50:08] <thinkt4nk> _BigWings_ untested, but here http://www.pasteall.org/32175
[10:50:23] <monk12> Same browser. same 3 liner jquery. same version of jquery. Slightly different wrapping html maybe, but both have <form> elements.
[10:52:15] <lenswipe> anyone able to give me a hand with a long polling problem im having?
[10:52:20] <_BigWings_> thinkt4nk: I just tried that
[10:52:28] <thinkt4nk> and?
[10:52:34] <_BigWings_> it doesn't throw an error anymore
[10:52:45] <thinkt4nk> cool, I guess, then?
[10:52:46] <thinkt4nk> lol
[10:52:55] <_BigWings_> but it only has a reference for the last element
[10:53:07] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/t4gWfLFb
[10:53:10] <lenswipe> thats my js
[10:53:10] <_BigWings_> so now whichever li I click
[10:53:28] <lenswipe> the problem is that im getting loads of duplicates back and im not sure why
[10:53:29] <monk12> heh, in one i did: location.href="index.jsp?"+ $('#textarea').serialize(); ... and other was: location.href="?"+ $('#textarea').serialize();  Former seems to work as I expect it to now
[10:53:37] <_BigWings_> I get the same data pasted into the currentImageName element
[10:53:55] <_BigWings_> which is the data of the last processed element
[10:54:57] <prefixed> I am essentially trying to use a linked-list to manage continuous track playing functionality on the following site; however, I am not 100% sure on how to actually set the next and previous elements in such a manner that will actually work (perhaps by setter helper methods?). Any ideas? SITE: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ CODE http://pastebin.com/Sr72wbMB
[10:55:19] <prefixed> someone's gotta know!
[10:56:00] <_BigWings_> thinkt4nk: any ideas?
[10:56:39] <arnpro> hey guys, does anyone happen to know a plugin for like managing help tips? those little icons next to let's say, each text field, where you click and shows a modal or triggers an action
[10:56:47] <thinkt4nk> _BigWings_ try this http://www.pasteall.org/32176
[10:56:54] <thinkt4nk> gotta go, though, so I hope that works :)
[10:57:48] <Whirl3d> prefixed, what are you trying to do?
[10:58:08] <prefixed> I am trying to get continuous play to work with the media players
[10:58:20] <_BigWings_> thinkt4nk: that works!
[10:58:23] <Whirl3d> So when one ends, the next starts
[10:58:25] <thinkt4nk> yay!
[10:58:27] <_BigWings_> thanks a lot !!
[10:58:28] <thinkt4nk> lol
[10:58:29] <_BigWings_> :)
[10:58:30] <prefixed> Whirl3d exactly
[10:58:30] <thinkt4nk> np :)
[10:58:37] <thinkt4nk> .each is your friend
[10:58:40] <monk12> arnpro,  maybe just SimpleTip plugin i think it was called. i wanted to use it for lil hover help popups.
[10:58:48] <_BigWings_> yeah didn't know about that one
[10:58:55] <thinkt4nk> know it, love it
[10:59:01] <Whirl3d> Without looking at the api, is there a callback for on-complete
[10:59:04] <_BigWings_> will do, thanks again
[10:59:08] <thinkt4nk> it's like your M16 in the military
[10:59:11] <thinkt4nk> lol
[10:59:19] <_BigWings_> :)
[10:59:31] <prefixed> Whirl3d yes, check my code. I believe I just need a couple helper methods to setPrevious and setNext
[10:59:53] <monk12> arnpro, guess the newer version is called qtip, example of 'help popups' stuff: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/
[11:00:33] <Whirl3d> prefixed, that's a mighty tall request to have somneone review the entire api for you
[11:00:51] <prefixed> Whirl3d api?
[11:00:55] <Whirl3d> but what about the jplayer.continuousPreview method
[11:01:13] <prefixed> Whirl3d did you note see my pastebinned code?
[11:01:16] <prefixed> *not
[11:01:38] <arnpro> great monk12  thanks!!
[11:01:39] <Whirl3d> the drupal.jplayer api , yes
[11:02:59] <prefixed> Whirl3d I'm a but confused with regards to your use of api
[11:05:07] <RFleming> Greetings and salutations!
[11:05:08] <prefixed> that is simply the implementation of some code, not the actual API
[11:05:15] <Whirl3d> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface
[11:05:40] <thinkt4nk> prefixed a lot of people use "api" and simply, "interface" synonymously
[11:05:43] <Whirl3d> to solve your problem for you, I have to learn the drupal.jplayer library
[11:06:05] <prefixed> ok
[11:06:19] <prefixed> Whirl3d then I didn't phrase my question correctly
[11:06:35] <RFleming> I'm trying to create a wordpress plugin with jquery, and have a <p> tag that I'm using with click().  For some strange reason, the click handler is called twice.  Any suggestions as to why that would be happening?
[11:06:52] <Whirl3d> the API usually includes a description of all the functions/routines it provides
[11:07:18] <prefixed> Whirl3d this is the API documentation. http://www.jplayer.org/1.2.0/developer-guide/#jPlayer-setFile
[11:07:36] <prefixed> Whirl3d it is not what I'm working on. I am simply utilizing the jplayer API in this instance
[11:07:47] <thinkt4nk> RFleming almost impossible to tell without seeing some code
[11:07:51] <Whirl3d> okay, am I supposed to divine the methods?
[11:07:54] <prefixed> anyway, give me a few minutes to rephrase my question.
[11:08:11] <Whirl3d> How can I tell you which method so the jplayer to use if I don't know the library
[11:08:14] <d3f4ultr0> gheez, a lot of people are calling me
[11:08:38] <RFleming> <p class="button">Add Field</p>
[11:08:40] <RFleming> jQuery(function($) { $("p.button").click(function() { $(".button").append(" clicked"); }); });
[11:08:52] <d3f4ultr0> zeropx, you still there?
[11:09:27] <RFleming> I then end up with <p class="button">Add Field clicked clicked</p>
[11:09:28] <Whirl3d> because for all I know, there's a continuous play method (at least it appears that there is from your pastebin code that wouldn't require any effort on your part other than applying the expected behavior to the right elements
[11:11:12] <tex3l> hey, I know jQuery.Ajax automatically follows redirects, but I'm seeing behavior where it also preserves the HTTP verb from the original request
[11:11:21] <tex3l> so if i "DELETE" then get redirected
[11:11:28] <imachuchu> is there a way to attach a function to be called when a jquery-ui dialogue is closed (via escape or the upper right X button)?
[11:11:31] <tex3l> it "DELETE"s the redirected url
[11:11:38] <tex3l> is that how it's supposed to work?
[11:11:44] <tex3l> (because that seems wrong)
[11:12:40] <RFleming> anyone?
[11:13:29] <Whirl3d> RFleming, do you mean add class?
[11:13:36] <ddifof> darcyclarke: thanks
[11:13:48] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, how do I display 3 divs(320x200 each) but not as the same time? I would like to add that effect
[11:14:37] <d3f4ultr0> before the first div completes displaying since i'll use fadeIn, I want a gap at least 250ms
[11:14:37] <Whirl3d> RFleming, append appends html to the element you have selected. So $("p.button").append("something") is goign to append "something" to your p element's html (hence the additino of "clicked" to your p text
[11:15:03] <Whirl3d> but if you mean to add the "clicked" class to the element, you would use $(this).addClass("clicked");
[11:15:16] <RFleming> Whirl3d: that's what I was hoping... but instead of "Add Field clicked", I'm seeing "Add Field clicked clicked"
[11:15:32] <RFleming> Whirl3d: http://pastebin.com/bbZtuX5m
[11:15:52] <RFleming> I'm expecting clicked to be added once, not twice.
[11:16:15] <RFleming> I don't know if this is a 'ME' issue, or a WordPress issue. :)
[11:16:38] <zeropx> d3f4ultr0: So sorry, I needed up going AFK because of stuff in the office.
[11:16:46] <Whirl3d> btw, this is a great time for a fiddle. brb
[11:17:20] <d3f4ultr0> np
[11:17:47] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6FDVS/4/
[11:17:56] <Whirl3d> just adds it once
[11:18:40] <Whirl3d> d3f4ultr0, check out .delay
[11:18:43] <RFleming> Whirl3d: ok, so then it's a Wordpress issue, because as a plugin, it's adding it twice :(
[11:18:48] <d3f4ultr0> k
[11:19:21] <Whirl3d> Rfleming, I am not sure about your plugin wrapper.
[11:19:24] <d3f4ultr0> so those div classes will be inside my document ready correct, then I wil use .delay?
[11:19:39] <poppiez> does the jquery UI datepicker support a date range without having to use two datepickers?
[11:20:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6FDVS/5/
[11:20:43] <thang> d3f4ultr0: http://jsfiddle.net/f6W3M/ something like this?
[11:20:46] <Whirl3d> RFleming, try using the wrapper in that second fiddle.
[11:20:47] <d3f4ultr0> checking
[11:21:21] <RFleming> Whirl3d: doesn't work...
[11:21:40] <d3f4ultr0> it's not working
[11:21:43] <RFleming> WordPress says to use the first wrapper.
[11:22:11] <thang> d3f4ultr0: my bad, i forgot to hit update. http://jsfiddle.net/f6W3M/2/
[11:22:21] <d3f4ultr0> :)
[11:23:00] <d3f4ultr0> yes, looks like that's what I need :D  Where can I set the delay?
[11:23:04] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/uFzFp/5/ can someone take a look at this for me
[11:23:29] <thang> look at the javascript, im setting the callback in each fadein to fade the next div
[11:24:15] <d3f4ultr0> can we specify value in millseconds rather than slow?
[11:24:22] <thang> yes
[11:24:33] <RFleming> Whirl3d: Thanks for your time... :)
[11:26:18] <d3f4ultr0> it's not working,  $('#one').fadeIn('5000ms', function() {
[11:26:31] <johnline3> '5000'
[11:26:39] <thang> shouldnt need quotes
[11:26:43] <thang> and no ms
[11:26:49] <d3f4ultr0> i tried 1ms too
[11:27:00] <Brodingo> ?fadeIn
[11:27:01] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[11:27:03] <d3f4ultr0> got it
[11:27:31] <d3f4ultr0> sweet!
[11:28:42] <d3f4ultr0> how are we going to change the code so that when div one is half way, div two starts getting displayed?
[11:28:44] <prefixed> I am seeing an error on Line 206, which indicates that I need to reference a valid "player" object. Can someone explain how I would go about setting/getting the next player object in the sequence? I believe I need to implement getter/setter methods for the "player" object, but am not sure how to do this.
[11:28:44] <prefixed> SITE: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ CODE http://pastebin.com/Sr72wbMB
[11:28:48] <prefixed> Whirl3d ^
[11:29:27] <d3f4ultr0> thang, currently, div 2 waits for div 1 before it shows itself
[11:29:48] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/uFzFp/5/ < how do i target <b> instead of the whole of <a>?
[11:30:34] <thang> thats the way i set that up, sounded like thats what you wanted. if thats not the case, take the callback out and set the fadeIns of each div with different delays
[11:30:49] <d3f4ultr0> got it
[11:32:07] <NoiseEee> johnline3: $('#content b') instead of $('#content a')  ?
[11:32:25] <d3f4ultr0> yes, it worked! :D http://jsfiddle.net/f6W3M/3/
[11:32:41] <NoiseEee> johnline3: or to be more specific if you need... $('#content a').find('b')
[11:32:43] <d3f4ultr0> jquery rocks!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:32:48] <d3f4ultr0> thanks a lot thang!!!
[11:33:00] <johnline3> i need the hover trigger to be <a> because i'll eventually indent the text in the imageframe
[11:33:30] <johnline3> thanks i'll look at the .find thing
[11:34:53] <prefixed> given that each player on this page is an object, how would I go about finding the "next" one in the series? http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[11:35:04] <johnline3> wow it worked, thanks a lot noise
[11:37:39] <prefixed> bear in mind that this "next' element would not be a sibling
[11:37:47] <Whirl3d> prefixed, I setup a hackneyed plugin for jquery that allows me to group elements and traverse the list like you would use jquery to travers the dom.   YOu would say var list=$.makeArray($("".jp-interface"); and then to cycle through them you could either use .each, .map or manually keep track of your position in the array
[11:39:48] <prefixed> Whirl3d yes, I had thought about that earlier; however, I kinda wanted to do this with a linked list. presumably, I would be able to do it if I could buidl/find a method that did what .next() does, except not with diblings
[11:39:52] <prefixed> *siblings
[11:40:48] <ajpiano> prefixed
[11:40:52] <prefixed> yes
[11:41:04] <ajpiano> you can use index based searches to emulate next but with anywhere in the dom
[11:41:32] <prefixed> ajpiano could you clarify on that point?
[11:41:35] <ajpiano> var foos = $(".foo"), current = foos.index( this ), next = foos.eq ( current + 1 );
[11:41:53] <ajpiano> assuming 'this' is the current element with class foo
[11:42:11] <prefixed> ajpiano ok, sure, but that wouldn't be a linked list implementation
[11:42:38] <Funkt> Hi there know this is jquery and will probably get slammed for asking but has anyone managed to get Nivo slider working with thumbnails?
[11:42:39] <ajpiano> i glanced at your problem for one sec i didn't see you asking anything about linked list implementations
[11:43:35] <ajpiano> assuming there's a method to get from the element to the player instance
[11:43:59] <prefixed> ajpiano I did way earlier in the conversation. any thoughts on this though? Is there a way to back up the DOM tree and then use next() to get the next element?
[11:45:11] <prefixed> perhaps .parent() would do it?
[11:45:51] <ajpiano> ofc
[11:45:57] <ajpiano> next gets the element next sibling
[11:46:04] <ajpiano> if you want the next sibling of the parent, .parent().next()
[11:46:08] <ajpiano> is the way to o
[11:46:30] <silverwind> :/
[11:46:42] <silverwind> .parent() and .next() are le evil
[11:46:48] <abjorn> o.0
[11:47:08] <silverwind> They're too specific.
[11:47:12] <ajpiano> silverwind: i wouldnt' architect an app that way either but that doesn't make them evil
[11:47:14] <abjorn> that's silly
[11:47:16] <ajpiano> exactly
[11:47:18] <ajpiano> it's pretty brittle
[11:47:20] <silverwind> You change the markup... and it fucks up everything
[11:47:30] <abjorn> yeah but that applies to lots of things
[11:48:00] <silverwind> ajpiano, .parent() is the worst :P because .closest() exists
[11:48:28] <prefixed> ok, so can someone explain to me, in object terms, what "player" is equivalent to in the following code? http://pastebin.com/hvL77Pxg
[11:48:31] <ajpiano> occasionally it's useful
[11:48:45] <ajpiano> prefixed: player is a native dom element
[11:48:56] <abjorn> saying it's evil implies it has no valid use :p
[11:48:57] <ajpiano> of the elements parent
[11:49:10] <prefixed> ajpiano that doesn't mean anything to me
[11:49:21] <ajpiano> sorry?
[11:49:40] <ajpiano> do you understand the difference between $("#foo") and document.getElementById("foo")
[11:49:43] <prefixed> ajpiano I mean, I do not understand
[11:50:01] <prefixed> no, I do not
[11:50:26] <ajpiano> prefixed: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6974582/jquery-object-and-dom-element
[11:51:28] <prefixed> ajpiano ok, that makes sense
[11:52:09] <ajpiano> prefixed: i have to get moving i don't think i can get much deeper in to the problem right now, sorry
[11:52:20] <prefixed> no worries. thanks for the assist
[11:55:10] <prefixed> ok, can someone explain what "player" is in the following code? Then can someone explain what $(player) is? Lastly, can someone explain how player and $(player) are related to "this"? http://pastebin.com/hvL77Pxg
[11:56:10] <Whirl3d> lol, that's what I was talking aboutwhen I said someone would have to know the api to help you...
[11:56:25] <NoiseEee> prefixed: "player" is a reference to an element with the class .jplayer.  $(player) is required to give that element jquery methods / turn it into a jquery object
[11:57:00] <prefixed> NoiseEee so "player" is the DOM element?
[11:57:11] <NoiseEee> prefixed: the function says "iterate over each element with the class .jplayer.  in the iteration, "this" refers to the current element in the iteration
[11:57:42] <NoiseEee> prefixed: yes, its the DOM element (an element with class .jplayer)
[11:58:17] <prefixed> and player IS the .jplayer class element
[11:58:28] <prefixed> rather, it is an alias for it?
[11:58:56] <NoiseEee> prefixed: player IS the *current* element being iterated (var player = this) that yes, has a class '.jplayer'
[11:59:16] <NoiseEee> prefixed: you can see all this yourself in console, by debugging or even just console.log'ing stuff
[11:59:33] <NoiseEee> prefixed: see http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 for how to make more sense of the code you're working on
[12:00:35] <prefixed> NoiseEee I apprecaite the help. I'm the type of person who learns better by discussing this srot of stuff intially
[12:00:45] <prefixed> this makes a lot more sense now
[12:00:55] <NoiseEee> right, just know that discussions can so quickly become abstract and you can lose your focus
[12:01:05] <NoiseEee> console.log / debugging lets you know wtf is going on right now
[12:01:10] <prefixed> yeah
[12:01:11] <NoiseEee> :) good luck
[12:01:31] <prefixed> I am actually interested in the abstract stuff as well
[12:01:54] <prefixed> jquery / javascript implement objects quite a bit differently than I'm used to
[12:02:28] <thinkt4nk> that's common for ppl coming from more classically OOP languages
[12:02:38] <prefixed> yeah
[12:02:46] <thinkt4nk> and for those not used to functional, asynchronous paradigms
[12:03:01] <prefixed> I actually began as a PHP programmer, so my mind is sorta all full of fuck right now
[12:03:15] <thinkt4nk> lol
[12:03:19] <thinkt4nk> PHP is an awful language
[12:03:27] <prefixed> you're telling me
[12:03:47] <thinkt4nk> hehe
[12:03:55] <prefixed> well, actually, I like it, except for the fact that it makes coding WAY too simple
[12:04:12] <NoiseEee> prefixed: its worth going over www.eloquentjavascript.net / https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript to bring you 'up to speed' so to speak
[12:04:29] <prefixed> yeah, I did a little reading about javascript the other day
[12:04:29] <NoiseEee> always good to have a nice foundation in natural JS
[12:05:09] <thinkt4nk> ^
[12:06:17] <prefixed> NoiseEee now, I can set properties of the $(player) object by doing something like this.property = some stuff, right?
[12:06:29] <prefixed> *current player object
[12:06:37] <NoiseEee> prefixed: well now that its become a jquery object, you might as well use jquery methods.
[12:07:10] <NoiseEee> that particular bunch of code could use some cleaning
[12:07:15] <prefixed> yeah
[12:07:45] <NoiseEee> ideally you have:  var player = $(this) so that you're always working with 'player' as a jquery object
[12:07:49] <prefixed> I'm creating a method to set the next property for the current $(player) object: this.next = this.parent().next();
[12:07:52] <NoiseEee> player.prop('something','value')  etc
[12:08:58] <prefixed> for the record, it doesnt help that I am 'hacking' this code
[12:09:10] <NoiseEee> meh, you'll learn / get hair on your chest
[12:09:13] <NoiseEee> i'm off, good luck
[12:09:15] <prefixed> which was terribly documented in the first place
[12:09:16] <prefixed> thanks!
[12:09:24] <shoky_> nomnom
[12:10:04] <prefixed> ok!
[12:15:17] <chovy> does this work: $.post(url, data, function(d){ ..}).error(function(){ // errors }); ?
[12:15:35] <shoky_> does it?
[12:16:24] <thinkt4nk> XD
[12:36:07] <trumpetmic> anyone: which IDE do you recommend for js dev?
[12:36:23] <prefixed> I use notepad++
[12:36:24] <catcher> trumpetmic, emacs
[12:36:33] <prefixed> although eclipse also works
[12:36:36] <catcher> (not an IDE at all, btw)
[12:36:41] <prefixed> (same)
[12:36:50] <thinkt4nk> vim ftw
[12:37:27] <thinkt4nk> find a modal, extensible editor, and learn it well
[12:39:32] <trumpetmic> thinkt4nk: I'm using Sublime Text 2, which I think falls under that category.  It's very nice in many ways, but I'm looking for a few other features that other IDEs have gotten me used to
[12:39:52] <silverwind> All IDEs suck for Javascript... but the best are those from jetbrains (IntelliJ IDEA for java, PHPStorm for PHP, Webstorm for Javascript... etc)
[12:39:57] <shoky_> my IDE recommendation is WebStorm
[12:39:57] <thinkt4nk> check out JetBrains WebStorm, if you really want an IDE
[12:40:01] <shoky_> :)
[12:40:03] <thinkt4nk> hah
[12:40:07] <thinkt4nk> wow
[12:40:11] <thinkt4nk> all of us at the same time
[12:40:15] <shoky_> yeh ;)
[12:40:17] <trumpetmic> WebStorm it is?
[12:40:20] <b-lew> does this look right to everyone... its not working for some reason, could it be because I have a dropdown menu?
[12:40:22] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/3962572
[12:40:23] <thinkt4nk> there ya go
[12:40:59] <johnkpaul> b-lew: change window laod to document ready
[12:41:06] <thinkt4nk> b-lew use $(function() { ... })
[12:41:07] <johnkpaul> $(window).load -> $(document).ready
[12:41:38] <thinkt4nk> also, why are you using an id _and_ a class for a selector?
[12:41:54] <thinkt4nk> for a single element
[12:42:32] <thinkt4nk> $('ul#nav li a') more succinct
[12:42:52] <thinkt4nk> you don't have more than one element with the nav id, do you?
[12:43:12] <johnkpaul> thinkt4nk: no need for the "ul" either
[12:43:46] <thinkt4nk> yep
[12:43:46] <xsamurai> using jquery ui autocomplete is there  an event or condition raised if the source returns an empty search query from a remote source
[12:44:34] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/3962610
[12:44:36] <b-lew> better?
[12:45:49] <thinkt4nk> b-lew looks good
[12:46:02] <Gorkyman> hey guys... what happens with JS that is being included in dom via .html() ?
[12:46:11] <b-lew> thanks for your time and help thinkt4nk
[12:46:18] <thinkt4nk> of course :)
[12:46:27] <Gorkyman> could I somehow set it to not excecute ?
[12:46:59] <johnkpaul> Gorkyman: empty the script tag before adding it to the dom?
[12:47:28] <thinkt4nk> Gorkyman if you want to control execution, add that logic to the script that's being included
[12:48:13] <Gorkyman> how?
[12:48:20] <b-lew> sweet its working
[12:48:24] <Whirl3d> hey all.
[12:48:26] <thinkt4nk> if you're using a rich back-end, you can parameterize that in the URL and pass to your template
[12:48:46] <thinkt4nk> b-lew awesome \m/ oo \m/
[12:49:30] <bobsomebody> whats the easiest solution to disable clicking (or other events) while animate is running?
[12:49:53] <thinkt4nk> bobsomebody see unbind
[12:50:23] <bobsomebody> i considered bind/unbind with a function but i cant rebind the same function within the animate
[12:50:49] <thinkt4nk> if you need to stash the handlers for later binding, you can access them through data('events')
[12:51:37] <thinkt4nk> or you could set some state on the animating element that the click handler can access and determine whether to execute or not
[12:51:55] <thinkt4nk> myElement.prop('animating',true) or something
[12:52:39] <bobsomebody> ah yeah i think i see what you're aiming at now
[12:53:34] <bobsomebody> im thinking since I
[12:53:36] <bobsomebody> oops
[12:53:40] <Whirl3d> in you click handler, you could use if ($(this).is(":animated"))  return false;
[12:54:36] <thinkt4nk> even better
[12:54:40] <bobsomebody> i found something like that on google but i wasnt sure how to impliment it, that above example makes much more sense, thanks :)
[12:59:54] <bobsomebody> Whirl3d, that did the trick (now that i see how it works), thanks again!
[13:00:12] <Whirl3d> np
[13:00:13] <bobsomebody> thinkt4nk, thank you as well for your input
[13:00:24] <thinkt4nk> sure thing! glad you got an even better solution
[13:02:24] <bobsomebody> on the off chance does anyone know of a nice, slim, and simple cross browser graphic slider? (similar to a scroll bar effect)
[13:07:13] <Yo1o> bobsomebody, EasySlider

[13:14:46] <angrywombat> i'm trying to add an event that handles a click on a text input which is disabled.. eg, when a disabled text input is clicked, i want to enable it
[13:15:10] <angrywombat> can anyone point me in the right direction for that? $('input[type="text"]').click(...) only works on enabled inputs
[13:18:18] <NoiseEee> angrywombat: its disabled; it can't receive an event
[13:18:24] <johnkpaul> angrywombat: there is no way to have a click event on a disabled element
[13:18:33] <angrywombat> i figured i just wanted to make sure, thanks guys
[13:18:44] <angrywombat> any way around that or should i just do away with the disabled bit?
[13:18:46] <dabear> wrap it in a div
[13:18:53] <dabear> and add the click event to the div
[13:18:58] <dabear> dunno if it works :p
[13:19:01] <NoiseEee> angrywombat: if it suits the same purpose essentially, try "read-only" instead of disabled
[13:19:04] <Whirl3d> so, I don't suppose that you could use .on
[13:19:15] <Whirl3d> on a parent element
[13:19:37] <angrywombat> maybe i can loop thru children of a specific span class?
[13:19:43] <prefixed> why is the following code giving me a "Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment " CODE: http://pastebin.com/TkYLvSxw
[13:20:36] <dabear> clicking will propagate
[13:21:00] <dabear> so this works if you attach click on the div: â€‹<div><input type="text" disabled="disabled"><â€‹/div>â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹
[13:22:06] <NoiseEee> prefixed: on line 27?
[13:22:21] <prefixed> NoiseEee yes
[13:22:32] <ddifof> so if i have a plugin
[13:22:38] <ddifof> and i declare it with subfunctions
[13:22:40] <ddifof> like
[13:22:40] <NoiseEee> prefixed: don't redefine ($this).  var $next = //etc
[13:22:56] <ddifof> $.fn.myThingy = function(){
[13:23:05] <ddifof> this.mysubfunction = function(){
[13:23:17] <ddifof> how can i access that subfunction in other subfunction
[13:23:22] <ddifof> subfunctions(
[13:23:26] <ddifof> subfunctions*
[13:25:14] <dabear> ddifof: you can't unless you do var $foo = $("foo").myThingy() and then $foo.mysubfunction()
[13:25:50] <Xoke> oh if anyone is interested I figured out my problem!  tiny_mce was causing the issue
[13:28:01] <ddifof> dabear: should i just declare i as a normal function then?
[13:28:14] <ddifof> because i dont need to access it from the "parent" object
[13:28:17] <dabear> ddifof: no, you shouldn't do this at all
[13:28:24] <ddifof> like if i do $(something).myPlugin
[13:28:26] <dabear> no you are doing it wrong(tm)
[13:28:34] <ddifof> i dont need to access it like $(something).mysubfunction
[13:30:30] <ddifof> can i access it like http://jsfiddle.net/Xrpar/
[13:30:34] <dabear> ddifof: http://blog.nemikor.com/2010/05/15/building-stateful-jquery-plugins/
[13:33:18] <Xoke> NoiseEee: tiny_mce was the problem - removing that include makes it work just as expected!  Now to figure WHY that is breaking it lol.  Thanks again for the help though :)
[13:33:46] <NoiseEee> np Xoke
[13:35:01] <dabear> ddifof: simply do this.subfunction1()
[13:35:33] <dabear> it will work here, but not if you'f not used jquery and it's remapping of "this"
[13:35:58] <Yo1o> $(this).subfunction1()
[13:36:00] <Yo1o> :p
[13:36:10] <dabear> ?
[13:36:10] <dabear> no
[13:36:16] <Yo1o> oh nevermind
[13:36:18] <Yo1o> :p
[13:36:32] <Yo1o> totally ignored the last part lulz :p
[13:38:32] <prefixed> why does the following code add an "active" class to ALL .jp-title elements (upon track conclusion) instead of just the next .jp-title element? http://pastebin.com/a4EJXkXV
[13:38:57] <prefixed> more specifically, why does my code think that player.next is more than one element?
[13:39:54] <johnkpaul> prefixed: what is player.next? where does it come from?
[13:40:01] <johnkpaul> what code calls continuousNext?
[13:41:08] <prefixed> here is all the code: http://pastebin.com/xQZ2FvhS there are methods which take care of each of those functions (or should, anyway)
[13:41:36] <johnkpaul> so in line 158
[13:41:41] <johnkpaul> you're calling continuousNext($(this))
[13:41:50] <johnkpaul> so the player function parameter is set to a jquery object
[13:42:18] <prefixed> johnkpaul yes, shouldn't it be?
[13:43:09] <johnkpaul> prefixed: I don't know the answer to that, but .next on a jquery object is a function, not a dom element
[13:43:33] <johnkpaul> so on line 230
[13:43:38] <johnkpaul> you say player.next.wrapper
[13:44:21] <johnkpaul> what is that supposed to be? player is a jquery object, player.next is a function, player.next.wrapper, I don't know where that comes from
[13:44:49] <johnkpaul> ^^ @ prefixed
[13:44:56] <prefixed> johnkpaul line 15
[13:45:03] <prefixed> var wrapper = $(this).parent().get(0);
[13:45:39] <prefixed> so it should be the parent DOM element
[13:45:56] <johnkpaul> ok, but when is that ever being set to player.next?
[13:45:57] <Xoke> NoiseEee: remove the 'autosave' option from tiny_mce to fix it!  I'll stop bugging you now lol
[13:46:06] <johnkpaul> perhaps you want player.parent()
[13:46:34] <prefixed> johnkpaul player.next is simply the next player object
[13:47:13] <johnkpaul> no it's not
[13:47:18] <prefixed> balls
[13:47:25] <prefixed> ok
[13:47:27] <prefixed> one sec
[13:47:28] <johnkpaul> prefixed: player.next is a function on a jquery oject
[13:47:30] <johnkpaul> ?next @ prefixed
[13:47:30] <bot-t> prefixed, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[13:47:35] <johnkpaul> player.next.wrapper is undefined
[13:49:11] <prefixed> johnkpaul ok, now I have it defined a little differently in such a manner that *should* work if my line of thought is correct http://pastebin.com/sdw0e5zU
[13:49:28] <prefixed> see line 228
[13:50:03] <johnkpaul> prefixed: :/ that's just as confusing
[13:50:06] <johnkpaul> player is a jquery object
[13:50:12] <johnkpaul> ?eval $().wrapper
[13:50:12] <bot-t> johnkpaul: undefined
[13:50:31] <johnkpaul> I can't tell what you're trying to do at all
[13:50:46] <prefixed> johnkpaul yes, "wrapper" is a field of the player object
[13:50:58] <imachuchu> how do you test which jquery-ui button is pressed in javascript?
[13:51:20] <johnkpaul> prefixed: I don't believe you are correct about that
[13:51:28] <johnkpaul> continuousNext is called with a parameter of $(this)
[13:51:42] <johnkpaul> $(this) is a jquery object, and does not have a wrapper field
[13:52:06] <prefixed> then what is $(this)
[13:52:46] <johnkpaul> I don't know exactly, prefixed, you use the "player" variable in multiple places for differnt things
[13:53:03] <johnkpaul> all I do know for sure is that it is a jquery object, and does not have a wrapper field
[13:53:13] <johnkpaul> prefixed: what exactly are you trying to do here?
[13:54:13] <prefixed> at the high level, I am trying to implement continuous play across media players on this site http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[13:54:57] <johnkpaul> :) that's a little too high level, what are you trying to do in  your code, I don't know anything about jplayer
[13:55:03] <prefixed> ok
[13:55:26] <hlveheart> what's the best way to columize list items in IE?
[13:55:40] <hlveheart> i heard there was an easy way to do it with jQuery
[13:55:42] <hlveheart> but o,O
[13:56:32] <prefixed> first off, I need to access the .jplayer objects' fields as defined beginning on line 13. I do not understand what I should be calling to access the "current" object + its fields
[13:58:28] <johnkpaul> prefixed: I don't know what you mean by ".jplayer object's fields"
[13:59:01] <prefixed> johnkpaul ok, see how there is an object defined beginning at line 13?
[13:59:21] <johnkpaul> Drupal.behaviors?
[13:59:34] <prefixed> that's what the object is called?
[14:00:23] <johnkpaul> prefixed: I am asking you
[14:00:30] <johnkpaul> I don't see an object being defined on line 13
[14:00:39] <johnkpaul> I see a function being assined to Drupal.behaviors.jPlayer
[14:01:06] <prefixed> wait wtf
[14:01:24] <johnkpaul> prefixed: http://pastebin.com/xQZ2FvhS
[14:01:26] <prefixed> then what are all the subsequent vars classified as?
[14:02:11] <johnkpaul> prefixed: I don't know what you mean, what subsequent vars?
[14:02:26] <prefixed> lines 15 - 22
[14:02:36] <prefixed> are those not object fields?
[14:03:03] <johnkpaul> no they are not
[14:03:10] <prefixed> oh christ
[14:03:16] <prefixed> so what are they?
[14:03:29] <johnkpaul> just local variabls to that function
[14:03:37] <johnkpaul> prefixed: what programming language do you work most in?
[14:03:46] <prefixed> java these days
[14:04:09] <silverwind> Java or Javascript^
[14:04:10] <silverwind> ?
[14:04:14] <johnkpaul> ok, you know how there is a difference between object fields and variables that are defined within methods in java?
[14:04:30] <prefixed> yes
[14:04:34] <johnkpaul> a variable that is defined within a method is not automagically defined on the instance of the object iself
[14:04:37] <johnkpaul> it's just local to that method
[14:04:39] <johnkpaul> same idea in javascript
[14:05:00] <johnkpaul> ?eval var func = function(){var test = "hello";};func.test == undefined
[14:05:01] <bot-t> johnkpaul: true
[14:05:29] <prefixed> oh
[14:05:33] <prefixed> then I have a problem
[14:05:43] <johnkpaul> :/ sorry to be the bearer of bad news
[14:05:51] <johnkpaul> makes a little more sense now though, because you're code is confusing as hell
[14:06:13] <prefixed> yep
[14:06:18] <prefixed> lots more sense
[14:06:38] <prefixed> hm
[14:06:46] <prefixed> well
[14:07:42] <_pr0t0type_> Hey guys.  Do any of you know where exactly the .date() jquery method stores the key/value pairs?  If I do $(body).date('test', 1); and check the DOM using chrome inspector (which loads changes dynamically) I do not see any tag property named 'test=1', but if I do $('test') i do get 1 back.  Any ideas?
[14:07:59] <_pr0t0type_> sorry, I mean .data()
[14:08:28] <_pr0t0type_> but if I do $(body).data('test')*
[14:08:32] <johnkpaul> _pr0t0type_: it's not meant to be messed with, it's in $.cache, you can see it from the source of $.data()
[14:08:33] <kevin_> How, or can, I do use the contents of a variable as a key, ie $.each(stuff,function(){ results.push({$(this).prop('id'):$(this).val()}) });
[14:09:15] <_pr0t0type_> johnkpaul: ah I see, makes sense now.  I will investigate this.  I was  just curious, thanks
[14:09:17] <NoiseEee> _pr0t0type_: that being said, feel free to use el.attr('data-test',1)
[14:09:33] <NoiseEee> _pr0t0type_: really depends on what you need
[14:11:20] <_pr0t0type_> NoiseEee: any reason to use data over attr, and visa versa?
[14:11:53] <johnkpaul> _pr0t0type_: depends on what you need it for, .attr actually changes the dom, .data does not
[14:11:55] <_pr0t0type_> Aside from the security through obscurity ($.cache vs right there on the tag) I don't see any point
[14:12:25] <NoiseEee> _pr0t0type_: i had one the other day; i wanted to query the DOM for elements that had a specific data value associated with it - i could search via attribute (data-customerid) but not .data('customerid')
[14:12:29] <_pr0t0type_> johnkpaul: I see.  Well, that makes sense.  not changing the dom > changing the dom
[14:12:43] <silverwind> _pr0t0type_, you might want something else than a string...
[14:13:00] <silverwind> _pr0t0type_, With data, you can associate whatever you want with a node.
[14:13:22] <silverwind> _pr0t0type_, for example, the configuration of a plugin bound to some node
[14:14:44] <imachuchu> how do I tell which jquery-ui button is pressed in a given buttonset using javascript?
[14:20:14] <kevin_> Any pro tips on this? http://jsfiddle.net/xx7DE/
[14:20:34] <imachuchu> normally $("input[name=buttonGroup]:checked", "formId").val() returns which radio button is pressed, all I get from the jquery-ui button is the value "on" (the two options are "all" and "current")
[14:20:36] <kevin_> in particular the "THIS DOESN'T WORK" bit - inputvalues.$(this).attr('name') = $(this).val();
[14:20:58] <kevin_> I want to use the return value from a function as a "key" for an object
[14:21:24] <johnkpaul> kevin_: http://jsfiddle.net/xx7DE/1/
[14:21:47] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @imachuchu
[14:21:48] <bot-t> imachuchu, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[14:21:57] <kevin_> johnkpaul: thank you, my magento brother
[14:22:11] <johnkpaul> hahaha
[14:22:22] <johnkpaul> no problem
[14:22:30] * shoelessone transforms into SHOELESSONE
[14:22:31] <imachuchu> johnkpaul: I wasn't sure if it was complex enough to warrent a clipping, but give me a sec. to post it
[14:30:30] <ateam> hi jquery-mobile users: I am using jquery-mobile in combination with phonegap - I am running into a strange problem - If I am adding tables inside of a div (overflow) the links are not working anymore...any idea?
[14:30:37] <ateam> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10722710/phonegap-touch-event-div-overflow
[14:30:43] <ateam> (plus picture) ;)
[14:41:31] <imachuchu> ok, here's the fiddle of my button problem: http://jsfiddle.net/aUyP8/
[14:42:11] <prefixed> what is "this" in the following code: http://pastebin.com/ujBZ8bNN
[14:42:33] <imachuchu> well got it, needed to supply a value in the input tag
[14:42:46] <johnkpaul> prefixed: the dom element with class .jplqyer
[14:42:54] <johnkpaul> imachuchu: so you figured it out? :)
[14:43:39] <aleray> hi, I run some tasks on the server side that generates images; what is the best way to detct when the image is ready and to consequently load it?
[14:43:56] <prefixed> johnkpaul so it is literally this <html element blah blah class=".jplayer">
[14:44:16] <imachuchu> johnkpaul: yep, still learning js/jquery, how they interact with html, and their differences to more traditional languages
[14:44:30] <johnkpaul> prefixed: depends on what you mean by literally
[14:44:34] <johnkpaul> it is not that string of characters
[14:44:40] <johnkpaul> it is the DOM node
[14:44:41] <raj> johnkpaul, unfortunately not gonna be able to make it today!
[14:44:49] <johnkpaul> raj: oh, that's too bad
[14:44:52] <raj> was looking forward to your presentation
[14:44:59] <johnkpaul> oh I'm not presenting today
[14:45:06] <raj> oh, then no harm done :)
[14:45:09] <johnkpaul> :)
[14:46:27] <prefixed> johnkpaul and $(this) is the object that contains the DOM node?
[14:46:44] <johnkpaul> no, that is a jquery object that wraps the DOM node
[14:46:54] <johnkpaul> prefixed: I think that you have to learn some of the basics of jquery
[14:46:55] <johnkpaul> ?learn @ prefixed
[14:46:56] <bot-t> prefixed, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:47:04] <thinkt4nk> thank you, johnkpaul
[14:47:05] <johnkpaul> take a look at that second link, prefixed
[14:47:14] <johnkpaul> thinkt4nk: for what?
[14:47:21] <thinkt4nk> for finally posting that
[14:47:23] <thinkt4nk> it's been all day
[14:48:23] <johnkpaul> ah :), you had the power anytime, thinkt4nk
[14:48:41] <thinkt4nk> lol, true
[14:48:48] <prefixed> I'm really just asking about this vs $(this)
[14:48:54] <thinkt4nk> was just ignoring
[14:49:21] <prefixed> thinkt4nk people like you make the coding world a bad place!
[14:49:39] <thinkt4nk> no, people like me spent a LOT of time reading
[14:49:48] <thinkt4nk> it's not unreasonable to expect the same from others
[14:50:02] <prefixed> thinkt4nk I have been reading, thank you very much. I simply came here to ask for clairifcations
[14:50:02] <thinkt4nk> you exhaust others' patience by asking the same question over and over
[14:50:25] <Dr-Bombay> looks like sperg hour
[14:54:17] <rroelofs> prefixed: you can find out what 'this' is at anytime by typing console.log(this); in the spot you are wondering about.  That way you can ask how and why questions instead of what questions
[14:56:34] <sayd> question about fixtures, are they only for testing? ex: loadFixtures in jasmine-jquery
[14:56:53] <johnkpaul> sayd: yes, that's pretty much the definition of a fixture
[14:56:53] <sayd> or would you load those same fixtures in using .load
[14:57:44] <raj> can I change the text in an <a> without affecting a nested <span> ?
[14:58:22] <sayd> johnkpaul: thanks, just curious what the use of them in prod would be, if any
[14:58:26] <prefixed> ok
[14:58:31] <prefixed> well
[14:58:48] <prefixed> that makes more sense. thanks rroelofs
[14:58:56] <prefixed> nothanks thinkt4nk
[14:59:03] <raj> or should I just separate the <span> from the <a> and force an underline of the <a> when the <span> is mousedover?
[14:59:16] <sayd> sounds like fixture == mock html
[14:59:19] <johnkpaul> sayd: ideally there shouldn't be overlap between your testing code and prod code
[14:59:22] <johnkpaul> sayd: yes, it is
[14:59:58] <johnkpaul> raj: just put another span is as a sibling to the first span
[15:00:05] <johnkpaul> instead of having a text noe as a sibling to a span
[15:00:26] <raj> ah, I see
[15:00:38] <raj> johnkpaul, that'd be the preferred solution over the others?
[15:00:59] <johnkpaul> IMHO, yes, I don't like seeing sibling nodes of different types
[15:01:35] <raj> k
[15:01:38] <raj> will do
[15:06:49] <prefixed> wow
[15:06:55] <prefixed> console.log() is awesome
[15:07:07] <prefixed> why didn't you guys tell me about this before
[15:10:28] <Peacy> Hi I have a question (I believe it's a short one) would someone like to help me?
[15:14:08] <dabear> hm
[15:14:14] <dabear> let's see what bot-t can do
[15:14:26] <hlveheart> stupid question
[15:14:28] <dabear> ?eval  $("<div><a>test<span>in a span</span></a>").find("a").contents().first().each(function(){ this.nodeValue = "lol " }).end().end().html()
[15:14:29] <bot-t> dabear: TypeError: div is undefined
[15:15:01] <dabear> ?eval $("<div><a>test<span>in a span</span></a></div>").find("a").contents().first().each(function(){ this.nodeValue = "lol " }).end().end().html()
[15:15:01] <bot-t> dabear: TypeError: div is undefined
[15:15:02] <Peacy> I want to make a onclick function for multiple divs with the same id
[15:15:20] <dabear> ?eval $.fn.jquery
[15:15:20] <bot-t> dabear: "1.4.2"
[15:15:27] <hlveheart> why would you have multiple divs on the same page with the same ID?
[15:15:28] <hlveheart> o_O
[15:15:56] <dabear> Peacy: ID stands for IDENTIFIER. it uniquely identifies something
[15:16:02] <hlveheart> ^^
[15:16:04] <dabear> unique = not multiple elements
[15:16:16] <hlveheart> Your best bet is to add classes to said divs
[15:16:31] <hlveheart> Classes are meant to be reused
[15:16:35] <Peacy> I have a image slider and for the thumbs i have a div that scrolls vertical down, on click on the li element i want it to scroll for example 30px down
[15:16:38] <Peacy> ok lets try that
[15:16:46] <hlveheart> On to my stupid question
[15:16:59] <prefixed> uh
[15:17:07] <prefixed> is there a better way to ascend up a tree than this: 	var next = $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().next();
[15:17:12] <Peacy> Lol goddam thanks
[15:17:13] <hlveheart> basically, I have a click function that hides a div, and fades in another element... but it's jolting the page on every click. Is there any way to prevent the page from scrolling on click?
[15:17:17] <hlveheart> np Peacy :P
[15:17:18] <Peacy> it worked
[15:17:24] <hlveheart> multiple divs = breaks shit
[15:17:25] <Peacy> :)
[15:17:25] <hlveheart> lol
[15:17:25] <dabear> prefixed: see ?closest
[15:17:26] <bot-t> prefixed, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:17:46] <Dr-Bombay> prefixed: you can use parents() to walk up the whole parent chain
[15:17:51] <prefixed> ok
[15:18:32] <Dr-Bombay> but making assumptions about how your page is laid out like that is brittle
[15:18:48] <prefixed> yeah, I realize that
[15:18:51] <hlveheart> dabear, want to give mine a shot?
[15:19:02] <hlveheart> i can't really upload a live example, nor jsfiddle it
[15:19:04] <hlveheart> lol
[15:19:22] <dabear> a shot of what?
[15:19:25] <dabear> skotch?
[15:19:26] <hlveheart> basically, I have a click function that hides a div, and fades in another element... but it's jolting the page on every click. Is there any way to prevent the page from scrolling on click?
[15:19:39] <dabear> jolting?
[15:19:52] <dabear> ?g jolting
[15:19:53] <bot-t> dabear, jolting - definition of jolting by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus ... - http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jolting
[15:19:56] <Bankzilla> preventDefault?()
[15:19:57] <hlveheart> It's jumping to the top of the page
[15:20:01] <hlveheart> Preventdefault didn't help
[15:20:02] <hlveheart> :/
[15:20:19] <dabear> hillct: set a height on the parent container
[15:20:31] <dabear> set a fixed height*
[15:20:42] <hlveheart> One of the divs that it shows is 1700px, and another is 450px
[15:20:43] <dabear> hlveheart:
[15:20:44] <dabear> *
[15:20:50] <Dr-Bombay> hlveheart: use animate instead of fadeIn/Out
[15:20:58] <hlveheart> ^^ i'll try that. thanks
[15:21:02] <hillct> dabear: what? me?
[15:21:07] <dabear> nope
[15:21:12] <hillct> yeah
[15:21:46] <hlveheart> lol
[15:22:41] <hlveheart> how would you .animate something like $("#Cat-CRMPOS").fadeIn("slow"); ?
[15:23:25] <raj> do i have to do something special to make a change of text fade in? I just did $my_a_tag.find('.myspan').text('replacement text').fadeIn()
[15:23:49] <hlveheart> $('"#Cat-CRMPOS').animate({ opacity: 0.25, height: 'toggle' }); ?
[15:23:49] <hlveheart> lol
[15:24:27] <raj> and it didn't work
[15:26:43] <raj> nm
[15:29:38] <suedoh> hi all, I'm trying to access a form input box inside a iframe.  I've tried several things based on suggestions online, such as:  $('#projectManager').contents().find('#email').val('email@email.com');
[15:29:57] <suedoh> projectManager is the iframe ID, email is a input text box within the projectManager iframe.
[15:30:08] <suedoh> Any suggestions on how to approach this the right way and get it to work?
[15:32:37] <prefixed> wtf Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'closest' on 	var next = $(this).closest('views-row').next('jplayer');
[15:35:51] <prefixed> does this even make sense?
[15:39:35] <prefixed> yeah, for some reason .closest() just isn't working
[15:39:38] <Dr-Bombay> no it doesn't make sense because views-row and jplayer are not tags
[15:40:12] <prefixed> 	var next = $(this).closest('.views-row').next('.jplayer');
[15:40:24] <prefixed> better?
[15:40:59] <Dr-Bombay> yes but it probably won't fix your error
[15:41:16] <Dr-Bombay> the error doesn't make much sense to me, what is this in the context
[15:41:20] <prefixed> that error shouldn't be occuring
[15:41:41] <prefixed> I have jquery 1.6 on this machine
[15:44:10] <Bill-barriere> should ("input[name='major']:text").val() be valid to get the text out of a text input?
[15:44:20] <prefixed> great, it looks like a drupal problem
[15:45:51] <Bill-barriere> ho dang thats the id not name
[15:45:51] <Dr-Bombay> $('input[name="major"]').val()
[15:45:53] * Bill-barriere slap self
[15:46:14] <Bill-barriere> Dr-Bombay, it work now i was just being a retard ;)
[15:46:59] <Bill-barriere> so i dont even need the :text on text input then heh
[15:47:39] <Bill-barriere> starting to like jquery, i usually (and still do) hate javascript to hell, but with this i can get shit done quite fast
[15:58:55] <prefixed> ok
[16:11:39] <prefixed> what does it mean if console.log(something) is giving me this: []
[16:12:25] <fission6> how can i use a tranisition like slide up fade in, etc. when injecting html using .before()
[17:04:42] <prefixed> so, is it even possible to get a refrence to the "next" element (meaning the element after "$(this)") in the "single" player version of this code? http://pastebin.com/8VEDEjqA
[17:11:15] <prefixed> FUCK YES I HAVE CONQUIRED JQUERY

[17:24:08] <kba> If you want to write some webinterface which depends a lot on JavaScript, how's the easiest way to do it? I feel like I'm being very inefficient when I have to save my js-file, switch to my browser, reload the window, and then see if it works
[17:24:21] <kba> I'm wondering if there is a more clutterless way of doing it
[17:24:30] <kba> any suggestions?
[17:24:50] <prefixed> good question
[17:26:22] <LessSeen> kba, use jsfiddle.net ?
[17:26:30] <sayd> is there any sugar for this kind of call? $('#' + someId)?
[17:26:43] <kba> I was hoping for some environment that'd let me have my source code/errors on one monitor, website on another monitor, and some keyboard shortcuts that'd allow me to reload the JS without using my mouse
[17:26:52] <kba> LessSeen: I can't, this isn't some 10 line script
[17:26:56] <prefixed> kba look at that guy LessSeen, I thionk he's treating you like a noob!
[17:27:03] <LessSeen> haha ,_,
[17:58:25] <tarepanda> Anyone here have any experience with jQuery Mobile? That channel is pretty much dead... :x
[17:59:11] <tw2113> what's jquery?
[17:59:19] <tw2113> and it has a mobile phone?
[18:04:01] <robin_sz> so, in the jquery UI demo, a button element does a nice mouse over to ui-state-active ...  I used the same html snippet, but nothing happens when I moouse over my button?
[18:05:52] <tarepanda> Do you have the styles?
[18:10:38] <robin_sz> styles?
[18:10:50] <robin_sz> I have ui-state-default set on the button
[18:11:04] <Whirl3d> johnkpaul, did you and shoky_ ever talk about your pipe video on vimeo?
[18:24:29] <psyolus> If I'm using jQuery.ajax with jsonp, I'm guessing I can't get the date header from the response?
[18:30:42] <marboro> hi to all
[18:31:05] <marboro> is anybody here

[18:35:23] <marboro> lol
[18:36:14] <marboro> hell you help me with callback on my site
[18:36:34] <eip56> whats wrong with it
[18:36:43] <eip56> and hell == will?

[18:47:37] <tw2113> what are the best javascript podcasts? :D
[18:47:45] <tw2113> that someone in here may listen to
[18:55:21] <munderwo-work> when getting the value of a select box is it better to do $('#idofselect option:selected')[0].value or $('#idofselect')[0].value ? or is there a better way?
[18:57:22] <Whirl3d> $("#idofselect").val()
[18:57:24] <marboro> eip56 ?
[18:58:37] <munderwo-work> Whirl3d: is that basically syntactic sugar? im fine with that, just wanted to know what was the best to use. will .val() work for multiple selections?
[18:59:43] <Whirl3d> isn't jquery semantic sugar in general. It's just javascript with some  sweetness, right?
[19:01:14] <Whirl3d> where is everyone tonight? Are they running a Weird Science marathon on the tele or something?
[19:01:40] <tw2113> blame beer
[19:01:59] <munderwo-work> Whirl3d: well yes. Sorry the syntactic sugar wasnt a minus against val(), I just want to know how it was doing things underneath and what val() wont do for me..
[19:04:08] <Whirl3d> munderwo-work, I wasn't offended--I just think that depending on your degree of scrutiny, you could technically define just about every library as "sugar" of some sort. But that not withstanding, there's something nice about being able to cycle through a list of elements and get their "value" using the same syntax....   .val()
[19:04:36] <Whirl3d> rather than a different syntax for radio group, selected, textarea, input, checkbox, etc.
[19:05:27] <munderwo-work> Whirl3d: certainly, its a very nice way to do it. Just wanted to know if there was any shortcomings/gotchas that I needed to know about. If thats the way to do it, then i'll go with that
[19:05:30] <Whirl3d> however, I have never had occasion to use a multiple select, so I don't know how val() works. It'd be an easy fiddle to play around with
[19:05:30] <munderwo-work> thanks!
[19:06:12] <Whirl3d> am I sounding confrontrational? I certainly don't mean to if I do. I was just shooting the shit with you.
[19:06:57] <Whirl3d> fyi, the heavy hitters are usually lurking, but you are more likely to get a better asnwer during the day (U.S. Time)
[19:07:52] <Whirl3d> overall I think tw2113  said it best: blame beer

[19:16:30] <eip56> Question: Ok creating a pluggin for a simple lightBox effect. Would it make more sense to just store the name of the clicked object or .children().on
[19:17:08] <eip56> ie: var container = $('#lightbox');  container.children().on()
[19:17:19] <eip56> or ie: var container = $('#lightbox img');  container..on()
[19:24:02] <Whirl3d> personally, I think container makes more sense
[19:24:21] <nights> hi guys
[19:25:03] <ruethewhirled> Hi
[19:25:04] <Whirl3d> like $("#lightobx").on({click, function (e) { var clickedTarget=$(e.target); do stuff
[19:25:35] <nights> on the header of this page i made a simple script to rotate images,  ( www-dev.maishoku.com  ), however  how can i avoid having the horizontal scroll ? i tried overflow: hidden of course...
[19:25:36] <nights> :(
[19:25:44] <nights> any input would be appreciated.
[19:28:25] <onats> hey guys, is there a good modal confirm box on javascript (trying to avoid confirm box)
[19:28:30] <Whirl3d> nights, where is your rotator script
[19:28:44] <ruethewhirled> Can't really debug it on my phone but are the images nested in a container with its width set?
[19:28:56] <Whirl3d> onats, lots of them   have you tried google?
[19:29:20] <onats> Whirl3d: actually trying to use foundation css' modal but i can't pass parameters to it
[19:29:36] <Whirl3d> why not?
[19:31:45] <Sazpaimon> this may be a niche issue, but .dblclick doesnt seem to work on a PS3
[19:31:48] <nights> Whirl3d: hm, one second
[19:31:58] <onats> Whirl3d: there are 5 buttons that should trigger that confirm box, and i would like to be able to pass in which  button was clicked (corresponds to certain images)
[19:32:14] <nights> Whirl3d: if you search for slider in the source
[19:32:17] <onats> reveal does not seem to allow me to pass that
[19:33:06] <nights> Whirl3d: script start with this row: var sliderOffset = 680;
[19:33:17] <nights> row 593
[19:33:39] <nights> sorry for the commented out lines. m(_ _)m
[19:35:19] <Whirl3d> nights. you just don't want the images to slide?
[19:36:51] <nights> Whirl3d: i want the images to slide and look the way they do now, but i want to remove the scroll in the browser
[19:37:31] <nights> if they images slides outside the current visibility scope of the browser it shouldnt bring in scrolling
[19:37:55] <Whirl3d> sorry, I have a huge monitor, Lemme resize
[19:38:07] <nights> ah, yeah. :) thats why
[19:39:31] <Whirl3d> now I lost the url. LOL hit me with it again, pleas
[19:40:13] <Whirl3d> onats, setup a jsfiddle with an example and I'll be you we can get it to work for ya
[19:40:30] <nights> www-dev.maishoku.com
[19:40:32] <nights> :)
[19:41:05] <Whirl3d> fyi, if you include the protocol when posting in IRC, it makes it easier to click to open...just fyi
[19:41:46] <onats> ok Whirl3d
[19:42:25] <Whirl3d> nights, the scrollbars are happening on your body or something. Not on ths slide
[19:43:08] <nights> hmm
[19:43:18] <nights> its because of the slider
[19:43:24] <nights> but im not sure where its happening
[19:43:32] <nights> i tried containing all of it in a div with overflow: hidden
[19:43:57] <Whirl3d> but you can scroll down and notice that thetop part of the page isn't the problem
[19:45:12] <nights> Whirl3d: hmm, im not sure what you mean, sorry. the horizontal scroll is because of the slider being 1600 pixels wide
[19:45:36] <ruethewhirled> Nights: its the div with class rotator
[19:45:44] <nights> you can see how the sliding images fade out
[19:45:59] <nights> ruethewhirled: thank you, yes i believe so
[19:45:59] <ruethewhirled> If you give it a position of absolute it fixes it
[19:46:07] <nights> ok let me try that
[19:46:13] <nights> let me also color this up for you
[19:46:18] <Whirl3d> not accurate
[19:46:19] <nights> think its confusing to look at it now
[19:46:32] <Whirl3d> I just disabled the slider and it still adds the scroll bar
[19:47:28] <ruethewhirled> Actually no position absolute doesn't fix it ;(
[19:47:32] <Whirl3d> plus why all the styles inside
[19:47:46] <Whirl3d> why aren't they in your document header?
[19:47:56] <nights> hmm
[19:48:01] <nights> its a bit messy now :(
[19:48:10] <nights> its cleaner to develop like t his
[19:48:23] <ruethewhirled> Well it fixes the scroll bar but hides the images...
[19:48:30] <nights> because i know what style corresponds to what container, but i will move it to header later
[19:48:50] <ruethewhirled> Anyway its a css issue
[19:49:09] <Whirl3d> setting the topslider to display none does not get rid of scrollbar
[19:50:52] <Whirl3d> yeah, I hate to say it, but you should ask the folks at #css
[19:51:00] <ruethewhirled> .rotator has its width set to 1540px which is giving h-scroll bat
[19:51:07] <ruethewhirled> Bar*
[19:52:19] <nights> http://www-dev.maishoku.com/en/
[19:52:21] <nights> i changed the colors
[19:52:25] <nights> its  easier to see the problem now
[19:52:26] <Whirl3d> i disabled the rotator, display:none still shows scrollbars
[19:53:23] <nights> essentially i want the span.slide-container not to cause overflowing, causing the scroll need
[19:54:21] <ruethewhirled> Add overflow:hidden to .headerbg
[19:54:45] <Whirl3d> actually add overflow:hidden to bodybg
[19:55:44] <nights> hmm ok let me try that
[19:55:48] <nights> sounds risky tho :)
[19:55:55] <Whirl3d> ruethewhirled, sorry I didn't see your reply
[19:56:07] <Whirl3d> then suffer with the scrollbars
[19:57:16] <ruethewhirled> Whirl3d: all good but your fix means no vertical scroll bars!
[19:57:35] <nights> thanks guys
[19:57:44] <Whirl3d> weird, I still had vertical scrollbars, just below the header
[19:57:48] <nights> yeah, headerbg is perhaps a little less wild
[19:57:51] <nights> but actually
[19:57:55] <Whirl3d> as opposed to the whole page
[19:57:58] <nights> i think theres no solution to what i want to do
[19:58:11] <nights> putting a overflow:  hidden to the headerbg element makes the slide not visible
[19:58:18] <nights> outside the headerbg area (which is obvious)
[19:58:37] <nights> i want to keep the effect of a really wide header so that the sliding elements can fade out nic ely
[19:58:43] <nights> but i dont want to introduce scrolling
[19:58:51] <nights> so i guess im looking for a hack
[19:59:07] <nights> or if i can do something to recalculate the bounds of the sliding area based on the browser width
[19:59:18] <nights> but it sounds complicated and will suffer performance
[19:59:27] <Whirl3d> gimme a break
[19:59:48] <Whirl3d> That's the least of your concerns with regards to performace
[19:59:54] <nights> ok
[20:00:00] <nights> so lets set the performance concerns aside
[20:00:07] <nights> still difficult to implement
[20:00:09] <Whirl3d> it's definitely best to ask the CSS folks who love CSS
[20:00:21] <nights> would be easier to just hide the horizontal scrolling
[20:00:25] <Whirl3d> We see it all the time. I thought this was a template
[20:00:26] <nights> isnt there a JS script to do that?
[20:00:34] <nights> template?
[20:00:39] <nights> it looks that good? ;)
[20:00:57] <Whirl3d> find any of the 1000s of other sites that employ the same style and snag their css.
[20:01:09] <Whirl3d> it does look good
[20:01:27] <nights> currently looks like this www.maishoku.com
[20:01:31] <nights> you think its an upgrade?
[20:01:41] <nights> took a full day to change
[20:02:19] <Whirl3d> yes and no...I like the bg image, but you really need to optimize it
[20:02:29] <nights> you mean of the new site?
[20:02:44] <nights> which parts dont you like of the new design?
[20:02:46] <oojacoboo> anyone know how to bind datepicker?
[20:02:52] <nights> the logo im requesting right now
[20:04:10] <Whirl3d> nights, i will give you my input, but please understand that you are asking for a critical analysis. I like what you have done, but I don't want to make comments if it's gonna hurt your feelings
[20:04:16] <oojacoboo> I guess I have to just call a function for it :/
[20:07:35] <AzMoo> Hi guys. Can anybody see something wrong with this? http://dpaste.com/752014/ When I call $("#myform").formblinds(); it's telling me the method doesn't exist.
[20:07:44] <AzMoo> Aside from the fact it does nothing.
[20:08:02] <suedoh> Hi all, if I want to push something from the server to a user (active session), what would be the suggested route?  Should I have a timeout interval running, or is there a new technology (another way)?
[20:08:06] <Whirl3d> do you have your code wrapped in document.ready()
[20:08:35] <Whirl3d> seudoh, can you give us more details?
[20:09:18] <AzMoo> Whirl3d: Sure do.
[20:10:00] <nights> i hate this designcrowd. NEVER USE THIS service.
[20:10:09] <nights> they will rip you off and you cant refund
[20:10:19] <nights> man im going to spam all design forums....
[20:10:36] <nights> hope they learn something about keeping customers not feeling screwed
[20:11:13] <Whirl3d> AzMoo, if you posted your stuff in jsfiddle, you could run it and we could see the error
[20:11:36] <suedoh> Whirl3d, so basically I have a dashboard page.  I want to alert the user of notifications while they are using the entire web application.  So for example some news alert comes in, then a special div is shown on the bottom right or something with that information, and they can just click '[X]' to close it.
[20:11:39] <suedoh> Hope I made some sense :)
[20:12:04] <Whirl3d> sure. Thanks for the explanation.
[20:12:14] <ruethewhirled> Azmoo you not passing in anything to formblinds so method = undefined
[20:12:52] <nights> Whirl3d: thanks for saying that, but i've taken a lot of negative feedback before and im quite pro about not getting upset about it now...so bring it on ;)
[20:12:58] <Whirl3d> I am not sure the best way to handle that. I have heard of something called a webworker, but much to my embarrassment, I have no idea what it is
[20:13:01] <suedoh> I've heard of technologies like comet, but I'm not sure if that is too complicated or not.  I want to make sure that my  timeout interval doesn't kill the users browser
[20:13:19] <suedoh> So that's why I'm a bit iffy right now on using a timeout interval
[20:13:52] <Whirl3d> The bgImage you are using has a negative feel to it. The way the sides and bottom fade to black looks more like the black is overcoming the image like a mold or fungus
[20:14:29] <Whirl3d> If you applied an effect ot the edges and got rid of the black completely
[20:14:36] <Whirl3d> then you could apply any background you wanted.
[20:14:55] <Whirl3d> Plus, it would make for a moreunifying structure between sections...
[20:15:10] <Whirl3d> one section would have a DARK DARK red, one would be DARK DARK GREEN
[20:15:12] <Whirl3d> etc.
[20:15:44] <AzMoo> heh, it works in jsfiddle. Sigh.
[20:15:47] <Whirl3d> but do a caustic edge on your image rather than the fade to black
[20:16:28] <ruethewhirled> suedoh: try searching for web sockets
[20:16:49] <Whirl3d> also, you should establish your header and footer as entities that have dimenion. Either drop a drop shadow below (or inside) the header/footer or outside.
[20:17:17] <Whirl3d> Outside would look like your maincontent was being pushed forward (but might look weird wit the image effect for the bg
[20:17:30] <Whirl3d> Inside would be consistent with your BG image...
[20:17:34] <nights> Whirl3d: wait, is this for the new site? http://www-dev.maishoku.com/ja/  (if you remember how it looked before i applied the colors?)
[20:18:49] <nights> Whirl3d: applied an effect to the edges, which edge do you refer to?
[20:20:37] <Whirl3d> gimme a second to rough one out for ya
[20:21:32] <nights> ok
[20:21:41] <nights> make sure all of this is for dev though
[20:21:47] <nights> the prod site is irrelative now
[20:21:49] <oojacoboo> anyone have an awesome validation script?
[20:22:57] <Bankzilla> I've got a few ul with li's and some li's with more ul's in them is there one line i can use to toggle the li's ul's without breaking the li's?
[20:23:40] <gf3> Bankzilla: CSS child selector
[20:23:58] <gf3> Bankzilla: Same principle applies to JS/Jquery
[20:30:44] <nights> Whirl3d: let me know if you have some more info m(_ _)m  sounds like you know a lot.
[20:32:44] <shoky> t
[20:37:07] <Whirl3d> nights....keep in mind this is ROUGH.. I just threw this together to illustrate my points...brb
[20:37:49] <Whirl3d> http://paigeharvey.net/assets/img/BG1.jpg
[20:37:54] <nights> no worries :) i love feedback
[20:37:59] <Whirl3d> http://paigeharvey.net/assets/img/BG2.jpg
[20:38:03] <nights> but oh man
[20:38:08] <nights> thats the old design
[20:38:09] <nights> :((
[20:38:11] <Whirl3d> lol
[20:38:14] <nights> www-dev.maishoku.com
[20:38:17] <nights> i said it plenty of times
[20:38:20] <nights> :D
[20:38:29] <nights> :~~~~~(
[20:38:33] <nights> anyway
[20:38:36] <nights> let me have a look
[20:38:45] <nights> some of it still relevant
[20:38:56] <nights> oh i see your browser doesnt support unicode?
[20:39:24] <nights> ah
[20:39:27] <Bankzilla> Anyone know of a function i can write in replace to make this cleaner? http://jsfiddle.net/2KZWv/
[20:39:32] <Whirl3d> You mean the NEW deisgn is the one with the slider...I like it better
[20:39:37] <nights> yes
[20:39:40] <Whirl3d> too much competition with the bg image in the last one
[20:39:42] <nights> thats why it says dev
[20:39:52] <nights> thanks for putting down the effort
[20:40:07] <nights> are you a freelancer?
[20:40:38] <Whirl3d> You realize there are problems with your tabs, too, right?
[20:40:58] <Whirl3d> I know SO LITTLE about the world
[20:41:11] <Whirl3d> I mean I am really miserably ignorant
[20:42:06] <nights> Whirl3d: on dev? whats the problem??
[20:55:05] <jahrichie> hey yall
[20:55:25] <shoky> hi y'ou

[20:55:31] <jahrichie> http://pastebin.com/nbUJfRrJ
[20:55:48] <jahrichie> i wana right a condition to make it stop after 600px from the top
[20:56:05] <jahrichie> i'm a back end guy, I got that much working but can't figure out the syntax to get in there
[20:56:14] <jahrichie> any pointers?
[20:56:31] <jahrichie> write*

[20:58:42] <nights> no more scrolling
[20:58:44] <nights> yey
[20:59:05] <Whirl3d> nights, did you come up with the new design? It's pretty tight actually
[20:59:25] <nights> to be honest actually i saw it on some random page
[20:59:29] <nights> i basically ripped it :p
[20:59:35] <shoky> yatta !
[20:59:42] <nights> yatta ne
[20:59:47] <shoky> sou sou
[20:59:56] <nights> yoku nihongo mada dekiru ne
[21:00:26] <shoky> mada dekiru = still can't ?
[21:00:28] <shoky> er
[21:00:31] <shoky> alrady can?
[21:00:37] <nights> it means
[21:00:48] <nights> you are still quite able to use japanese arent you
[21:00:54] <shoky> ;P
[21:01:53] <nights> man i love bootstrapped web services
[21:02:05] <nights> they are MONEY MACHINES :DDDD
[21:02:30] <jahrichie> so I jfiddled my question, sorry about that used to pastebiN! http://jsfiddle.net/XC6Ps/4/
[21:03:44] <shoky> jahrichie:  you mean this? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/XC6Ps/5/
[21:03:56] <Whirl3d> nights, click on the tabs... do you see the bg flash quickly
[21:04:08] <jahrichie> shoky:  damn
[21:04:11] <jahrichie> that was easy
[21:04:14] <shoky> ;p
[21:04:16] <jahrichie> i owe you one?
[21:04:32] <shoky> it hardly took more than 5 seconds ;p
[21:04:46] <nights> Whirl3d: yeah, but thats natural when loading isnt it? its not ajax
[21:04:54] <jahrichie> i had the condition just wasn't sure where to throw it
[21:04:56] <jahrichie> thanks a bunch
[21:04:59] <shoky> np
[21:05:10] <Whirl3d> I am seeing a big tiled bg image
[21:05:19] <Whirl3d> like the old sites bg
[21:05:24] <nights> oh really
[21:05:26] <nights> oh yeah
[21:05:27] <nights> that might be right
[21:05:31] <nights> i need to disable that image
[21:05:34] <nights> thanks
[21:05:44] <nights> btw,  you need to upgrade your computer ;)
[21:05:51] <Whirl3d> me?
[21:05:51] <nights> didnt even flash here
[21:06:09] <Whirl3d> I have a 47" monitor
[21:06:09] <shoky> what are bootstrapped web services?
[21:06:11] <nights> quad core with 32gb ram :D
[21:06:42] <nights> shoky: web services setup so that they make you a mountain of money without lifting a finger
[21:06:54] <shoky> how's that
[21:06:55] <Whirl3d> corei5 oc to 4.3 with 20gbDDR3 and a 256Gb SSd
[21:07:03] <nights> hehe
[21:07:06] <nights> thats quite nasty!
[21:07:16] <nights> :D
[21:07:25] <Whirl3d> but the big montior is the problem...things render differently
[21:07:28] <nights> i wonder why you see that bg flash and not be
[21:07:32] <nights> maybe the graphics card
[21:07:35] <nights> no
[21:07:38] <nights> that shouldnt matter
[21:07:55] <nights> maybe because of network lag
[21:07:58] <nights> we are using amazon
[21:08:13] <Whirl3d> it takes a long time to tile 4 hires bG images to make the bg on my monitor.
[21:08:22] <nights> hm a
[21:08:23] <nights> h
[21:08:29] <nights> why such a huge monitor
[21:08:35] <tw2113> why so tiny?
[21:08:36] <nights> im using 2x 26"
[21:08:38] <Whirl3d> I have a lot of shit open all the time
[21:08:48] <nights> just get more monitors
[21:08:50] <nights> :D
[21:08:58] <tw2113> the same size
[21:09:07] <tw2113> or bigger!
[21:09:10] <Whirl3d> I have 2, one veritcal 26" and the big 47"
[21:09:22] <nights> haha
[21:09:25] <nights> you can get a suntan
[21:09:28] <nights> in your office
[21:09:37] <Whirl3d> It's next to my bed in my bedroom. LOL
[21:09:58] <Whirl3d> I have a separate standlone AC unit for my PC/monitors/peripherals. LOL
[21:10:34] <nights> hehe
[21:10:50] <shoky> nights how do i setup web services to make me mountains of money : (
[21:11:02] <nights> i dont know yet
[21:11:07] <nights> but once i know ill share
[21:11:07] <shoky> o.

[21:11:50] <nights> haha
[21:11:52] <nights> fleshlights
[21:12:13] <Whirl3d> I am sure he makes a killing.
[21:12:16] <Whirl3d> Nice guy too
[21:12:22] <shoky> yap
[21:12:23] <nights> hehe
[21:12:28] <nights> but what do you say when someone asks
[21:12:36] <nights> i sell porn-sex toys
[21:12:38] <Whirl3d> He was pretty up front about it
[21:12:42] <shoky> sex toys
[21:12:45] <nights> yeah in this chan
[21:12:52] <nights> who cares what peeps think here
[21:12:55] <Whirl3d> He even volunteered that he hadn't fucked on model of the toys...
[21:12:59] <shoky> i'd be very up front about it with anyone..
[21:13:05] <Whirl3d> I was like, ....WAT!?
[21:13:29] <nights> shoky: hehe... sure you woul,d
[21:13:39] <shoky> you don't know me..
[21:13:41] <shoky> i would ;)
[21:13:48] <Whirl3d> shoky, where do you live?
[21:13:52] <shoky> tel aviv
[21:13:54] <nights> telaviv
[21:13:58] <nights> see
[21:14:01] <nights> i know a lot about you
[21:14:04] <nights> :D
[21:14:04] <shoky> right
[21:14:06] <shoky> ;p
[21:14:16] <nights> how about your mum?
[21:14:22] <shoky> what about her?
[21:14:33] <nights> hey mom, so actually i make a lot of money selling porn/sex toys
[21:14:42] <shoky> yes
[21:14:48] <nights> sure i could tell my drinking buddies. but thats about it.
[21:14:51] <shoky> i would definitely share that with her.......
[21:14:56] <nights> nice
[21:15:13] <nights> anyway
[21:15:20] <shoky> i told her about my acid trips
[21:15:22] <nights> neither of us is bootstrapping a sex-toy service
[21:15:24] <shoky> she told me about hers ;P
[21:15:28] <nights> lol
[21:15:29] <nights> well
[21:15:37] <nights> thats not common....
[21:15:39] <nights> i can tell you that much
[21:15:45] <shoky> should be ;P
[21:15:50] <nights> acid...?
[21:15:51] <nights> :D
[21:15:53] <shoky> ah no
[21:16:01] <nights> sharing experiences yes
[21:16:11] <nights> but you shouldnt have had those in the first place :p
[21:16:25] <shoky> you sound like someone else's mom :)
[21:16:27] <nights> you can get a lot of nice experiences sober
[21:16:30] <nights> :D
[21:16:35] <shoky> indeed you can
[21:16:42] <Whirl3d> Both have value
[21:17:13] <Whirl3d> but for the most part, I gotta say that sobreity is really overrated
[21:17:24] <shoky> :)
[21:17:28] <shoky> +1
[21:17:53] <shoky> making sex toys is underrated :(
[21:17:55] <nights> get a girlfriend who is
[21:17:56] <nights> $Bkx(B¼$Bea(B¯$Bl9Bg(B¥³$Be`(B€$Bj&Xe"1j*(B¼$Bj+(B¦
[21:17:58] <nights> ;)
[21:18:00] <nights> thats all i can tell you
[21:18:11] <Whirl3d> what was all that?
[21:18:13] <shoky> nani
[21:18:18] <nights> shoky can tell you
[21:18:29] <shoky> not sure i can :)
[21:18:37] <nights> http://translate.google.com/#ja|en|%E6%98%BC%E3%81%AF%E6%B7%91%E5%A5%B3%E3%80%80%E5%A4%9C%E3%81%AF%E5%A8%BC%E5%A9%A6
[21:18:41] <nights> doesnt translate well
[21:18:45] <nights> but theres a saying in japanese
[21:18:53] <shoky> oh, i dont have unicode set in this chan
[21:18:55] <nights> daytime lady, nighttime whore
[21:18:56] <shoky> er was that unicode
[21:18:57] <shoky> no
[21:19:13] <shoky> you .jps and your SJIS or whatever
[21:19:16] <nights> and apparently its the ultimate girlfriend
[21:19:23] <nights> :D
[21:19:30] <nights> having made one myself i can totally agree
[21:19:48] <nights> apparently they are very unusual so i have to treat  this one well :)
[21:20:21] <Whirl3d> Okay, I gotta know. How old are the two of you?
[21:20:33] <nights> not sure why we deviated here from acid ...
[21:20:34] <nights> :D
[21:20:45] <nights> shes 24 im 28 :D
[21:20:55] <nights> its almost like the roman style
[21:21:04] <shoky> wait what
[21:21:06] <nights> age = your_age/2 + 7
[21:21:20] <nights> this should be every guys model
[21:21:26] <nights> it works flawlessly.
[21:21:43] <Whirl3d> When I was 17, I was engaged to a 28 year old woman.
[21:21:48] <nights> wow
[21:21:56] <shoky> heh
[21:21:58] <nights> was
[21:22:02] <nights> what happend :DD
[21:22:09] <Whirl3d> but she was faking the pregnancy, so I bolted.
[21:22:23] <nights> haha
[21:22:25] <nights> oh my
[21:22:30] <nights> 28 year olds
[21:22:31] <Whirl3d> you just don't lie to someone about that
[21:22:34] <nights> no
[21:22:36] <shoky> i had smth similar with a 25 year old lady, when i was 19
[21:22:41] <nights> i had the same joke yesterday
[21:22:50] <nights> having paid for an abortion already
[21:22:56] <nights> i got quite scared
[21:22:57] <Lucky--> this is gay: http://jsfiddle.net/L9sC3/3/ it works in jsfiddle, runs fine with no error messages in my browser, but ZERO content shows wheN I put it on my page.
[21:23:17] <shoky> boo kendo boo
[21:23:37] <nights> Lucky--: then you should show us your page
[21:23:37] <Whirl3d> She would come into my physics class in high heels and slinky shorts and lean over my professors desk to ask if she could take me out of class. lol
[21:23:46] <Lucky--> nights:uploading
[21:23:56] <nights> Whirl3d: LOL, thats funny...
[21:24:06] <nights> watch your professor tho
[21:24:09] <Lucky--> https://www.24-7cashadvance.com/3/step3.htm
[21:24:11] <nights> they take all chances they can get
[21:24:24] <nights> (which are not that many)
[21:24:28] <tga> hello
[21:25:17] <nights> Lucky--: before i solve this for you, can i request a cashadvance of $1000? :p
[21:25:45] <Lucky--> nights: lol, if you want one go ahead and apply, Ill give you a different link :-P
[21:26:11] <Whirl3d> LUcky's what's not working about it?
[21:26:27] <tga> any good resources on jquery mobile app structure?
[21:26:31] <Lucky--> Whirl3d: it wont append my validation errors :-(
[21:26:48] <Lucky--> i was originally trying in a window, but that wasnt settign teh content, so I reduced it to simpler for debugging
[21:26:49] * tga is having trouble splitting a larger app into individual pages
[21:26:57] <Whirl3d> It appears to be appending them for me
[21:27:21] <Lucky--> where?
[21:27:25] <Whirl3d> tga I like jqueryMobile for simple stuff
[21:27:34] <Whirl3d> right next to the field
[21:27:40] <Lucky--> thats the live validation
[21:27:43] <Lucky--> hold up I need to update
[21:27:52] <tga> this isn't horribly complicated, but I want to keep my pages and scripts in individual files
[21:27:57] <Lucky--> i have a local link referenced ina JS file
[21:27:57] <tga> instead of mashing everything together
[21:28:26] <Whirl3d> jquery mobile does that
[21:28:31] <nights> Whirl3d: what are you working on atm?
[21:29:10] <Whirl3d> believe it or not, I am working on a very basic gallery for experience using .pipe and deferreds
[21:29:20] <tga> Whirl3d: if I keep only the page div in a separate file, linking it will change the url to that file
[21:29:31] <tga> and any subsequent reloads will get me a naked nonfunctional page
[21:29:32] <Whirl3d> it's part of an animation engine I hope to finish one day
[21:29:49] <tga> deferreds are great, but there needs to be a better way of chaining them
[21:30:01] <Whirl3d> that's .pipe
[21:30:38] <Whirl3d> tga, use ajax to load the pages, maybe?
[21:30:56] <tga> that's what changePage() does
[21:31:02] <tga> but it also changes my url
[21:31:20] <Whirl3d> ovveride it then
[21:31:42] <tga> I don't quite get how chain() is supposed to work
[21:32:06] <tga> ideally I'd like to pass in an array of deferreds and have them call each other with the resolve output
[21:32:18] <Whirl3d> lookup pipe
[21:32:29] <Whirl3d> or use .when
[21:32:44] <tga> when is no good, it doesn't guarantee chaining
[21:32:48] <Whirl3d> actually, .pipe is it
[21:33:07] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tcJrh/9/
[21:33:30] <Whirl3d> shoky has a better version, lemme see if I can find it.
[21:33:54] <tga> huh, interesting
[21:35:27] <defaultro> need help folks on jsfiddle.net/tfn4X/         It's currently working. I am also not sure if window.open is a jquery code but it's working for me. Can jquery figure the URL?
[21:35:56] <tga> Whirl3d: got it, thanks
[21:36:11] <Lucky--> ok check the page now: https://www.24-7cashadvance.com/3/step3.htm
[21:36:16] <Lucky--> you'll see what I mean
[21:36:33] <defaultro> I would like to make the url dynamic so I can just suffix the string 'welcome/moredetails'
[21:36:48] <Lucky--> i actually wrote some rest services to handle the validation, I just proxy the validation up to the server, because we are a network, and I didnt feel like writing two forms of the exact same thing
[21:37:04] <prefixed> ok
[21:37:50] <defaultro> can I do this window.open(($location).attr('href')+'welcome/moredetails');
[21:37:53] <defaultro> is that correct?
[21:38:41] <prefixed> logic question. is the following REALLY the best way to find the relecant "jplayer" element? Also, isn't it's bigO something like n^2? 			var stopThis = $('.view-content').find('.active').closest('.music_player_container').find('.jplayer');
[21:38:56] <prefixed> on this site http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/#
[21:39:00] <Lucky--> Whirl3d: is it appending for you now, https://www.24-7cashadvance.com/3/step3.htm
[21:39:17] <defaultro> hey folks, was my concatenation right?
[21:39:19] <Whirl3d> Yes
[21:39:27] <Lucky--> do you get the popup?
[21:39:33] <Lucky--> its the popup results that are supposed to be appended
[21:39:40] <Whirl3d> lucky, blank popup
[21:39:44] <Lucky--> only the contact info
[21:39:49] <Whirl3d> where is the append command
[21:39:49] <Lucky--> the contact info page
[21:40:02] <Lucky--> put like letters in for phone, append is in payday.js
[21:40:18] <defaultro> yay, it worked! :D
[21:41:04] <Lucky--> line 229
[21:41:31] <Whirl3d> maybe you aren't loading payday?
[21:42:28] <Whirl3d> like I don't see it in the manifest of content scripts
[21:43:52] <Whirl3d> I see it in the source, though
[21:46:28] <Lucky--> Whirl3d: payday controls everything, the site wouldnt show correctly otherwise
[21:48:20] <Whirl3d> Lucky, I wish I could help you, but I just don't have the patience or focus to learn payday.js and troublehsoot the problem. good luck though. It shouldn't be that hard.
[21:54:53] <shoky> o
[21:55:14] <shoky> Whirl3d: tga: btw, that fiddle you were talking about is http://jsfiddle.net/tcJrh/7/
[21:55:19] <shoky> i think
[21:55:39] <tga> I think I got the point, I'm already reorganizing some nested code
[21:55:41] <Whirl3d> great. thanks
[22:10:17] <tga> I wonder what's worse, cramming multiple pages in a single app, with xhr page loads
[22:10:30] <tga> vs separating pages and repeating the layout on each one
[22:10:48] <tga> (and app initialization, config reads, api calls)
[22:11:13] <shoky> either is bad if stuff isn't organized
[22:12:09] <tga> yeah, I'm thinking I should keep them as separate pages so I don't have any weird interactions
[22:12:19] <tga> some pages load a lot of stuff from the api and display lists, etc
[22:12:23] <tga> other pages are smaller
[22:13:41] <shoky> prefixed: what do you mean
[22:14:42] <shoky> prefixed: that is probably NOT the most efficient way...
[22:14:49] <shoky> probably far from it
[22:15:00] <shoky> as you've implied
[22:16:43] <prefixed> yeeesss
[22:16:52] <prefixed> I can't think of a better way though
[22:17:08] <shoky> well
[22:17:18] <shoky> why not first say what you're after
[22:17:27] <shoky> i'm assuming you want to find some jplayer when some event happens?
[22:18:01] <shoky> the event would be related to an element, and you can use that element as the starting point for the DOM search
[22:18:17] <prefixed> ok
[22:19:06] <shoky> ok
[22:19:49] <oojacoboo> if I have a child function, can't I access the local variables set in the parent without declaring them as explicit?
[22:20:10] <shoky> show an example of what you mean
[22:20:11] <prefixed> so, at the high level, I need to make sure that no two players on the same page are playing at once
[22:20:14] <gf3> oojacoboo: Yes sir
[22:20:27] <gf3> oojacoboo: Also there is no such thing as explicit in JS
[22:20:32] <gf3> oojacoboo: Lexical scoping FTW
[22:20:49] <oojacoboo> gf3, implicit :P
[22:21:30] <oojacoboo> btw, this is what I'm working withâ€¦ https://gist.github.com/17a91f7142bc249dd515
[22:21:39] <shoky> prefixed: you can always cache a reference to the '.active' element when making it active..
[22:21:51] <oojacoboo> the issue I have is with "this" in the validateRequired function
[22:22:28] <oojacoboo> I had been trying to use $this and was just playing around with this in that gist
[22:22:32] <shoky> you're calling 'this' a local variable set in the parent ?
[22:22:39] <oojacoboo> ^^
[22:22:42] <shoky> that's wrong.
[22:22:47] <oojacoboo> can you explain
[22:23:04] <shoky> 'this' changes frequently in function calls
[22:23:12] <oojacoboo> yes, I know
[22:23:16] <oojacoboo> I was using $this
[22:23:19] <shoky> if you want you can cache it in the 'parent' function
[22:23:20] <oojacoboo> as I was saying
[22:23:20] <shoky> oh.
[22:23:24] <gf3> oojacoboo: You can bind functions to a specific context to control `this`
[22:23:30] <prefixed> shoky I am currently assiging an "active" class to all active players. The thing is, "active" is in a different branch of the tree than "jplayer"
[22:23:54] <shoky> prefixed: there's more than one active..?
[22:24:08] <prefixed> presumably, I could just move "active" to the same branch as "jplyer"
[22:24:10] <oojacoboo> is $this not accessible?
[22:24:13] <oojacoboo> I'm confused
[22:24:29] <oojacoboo> line 65/66 defines it
[22:24:50] <shoky> (just 66)
[22:24:58] <oojacoboo> yea, well, that's the function :)
[22:25:25] <gf3> oojacoboo: It is accessible
[22:25:34] <oojacoboo> I get "non_object_property_load"
[22:26:08] <oojacoboo> at like 111 this.value.length
[22:26:12] <oojacoboo> line*
[22:26:25] <shoky> you're using both this and $this ?
[22:26:37] <oojacoboo> shoky, as I was saying, I was playing around with that
[22:26:51] <shoky> ok, so what exactly is the issue..
[22:27:09] <oojacoboo>  oojacoboo: I get "non_object_property_load"
[22:27:09] <oojacoboo> [01:26] oojacoboo: at like 111 this.value.length
[22:27:21] <shoky> what's non_object_property_load
[22:27:23] <gf3> oojacoboo: in validateRequired, `this` is `window`
[22:27:36] <shoky> why are you asking about 'this' still ?
[22:27:38] <oojacoboo> gf3, let's pretend that is $this
[22:27:46] <shoky> let's not
[22:27:49] <oojacoboo> I was changing it around as I was playing with it
[22:27:49] <gf3> oojacoboo: :-/
[22:28:29] <oojacoboo> https://gist.github.com/c7d115c59d95162b21db
[22:28:34] <oojacoboo> new gist, same error
[22:28:47] <gf3> oojacoboo: What line is the error on?
[22:28:51] <oojacoboo> 111
[22:28:57] <oojacoboo> this.value.length
[22:29:15] <gf3> oojacoboo: $this.val()
[22:29:23] <gf3> not $this.value
[22:29:24] <oojacoboo> b/c it's a jquery obj
[22:29:28] <gf3> Right
[22:29:29] <shoky> ..
[22:31:06] <oojacoboo> thanks gf3, I thought that might be it but for some reason thought that js methods were BC with jquery
[22:31:11] <oojacoboo> jquery objects
[22:31:28] <gf3> oojacoboo: NP
[22:31:34] <oojacoboo> the jq objects don't share the same methods with proto objects?
[22:31:44] <shoky> jq objects are not DOM elements.
[22:31:49] <gf3> oojacoboo: If you need the actual DOM obj, you can do $this[0]
[22:31:57] <oojacoboo> oh nice
[22:32:02] <oojacoboo> so it's a wrapper object?
[22:32:08] <gf3> oojacoboo: Yessir
[22:32:12] <oojacoboo> cool, thanks
[22:32:24] <oojacoboo> that clears up a lot :)
[22:34:06] <prefixed> shoky yes, anything that is "played" is set to active until it stops
[22:38:24] <prefixed> shoky I'm just going to move "active" over to the same DOM as jplayer
[22:39:02] <shoky> prefixed: sry falling asleep. gnight
[22:39:08] <prefixed> gnite
[22:45:52] <drojas> hello! what's the simplest way to chain two functions?
[22:46:26] <Cork> drojas: what functions are you talking about?
[22:46:50] <smplstk> msg chanserv op
[22:46:56] <smplstk> woops
[22:46:58] <smplstk> trololo
[22:47:36] <drojas> Cork: my own custom functions
[22:48:29] <prefixed> Time for the "what's wrong with this method" game! var stopThis = $('.view-content').find('.jplayer .active');
[22:48:29] <drojas> both of them require one argument.. btw
[22:48:55] <Cork> var elm; elm = { func1: function() { print('func1'); return elm; }, func2: function() { print('func2'); return elm;  } }; elm.func1().func2();
[22:48:58] <Cork> ?eval var elm; elm = { func1: function() { print('func1'); return elm; }, func2: function() { print('func2'); return elm;  } }; elm.func1().func2();
[22:49:14] <Cork> bah... the bot is down again >_<
[22:49:37] <tw2113> nooooooooooooo
[22:50:27] <prefixed> ok
[22:50:34] <Cork> drojas: ^
[22:50:56] <prefixed> so how can I find only elements which have two classes? (namely .jplayer and .active
[22:50:57] <prefixed> )
[22:51:12] <Cork> $('.jplayer.active')
[22:51:30] <prefixed> what would a space in between them do?
[22:51:46] <Cork> then you get .active elements that are inside .jplayer
[22:52:03] <Cork> prefixed: you know how css selectors work right?
[22:52:25] <prefixed> Cork more or less. I'm a little rusty on the details
[22:52:35] <prefixed> it's been a year or so since I've worked with them
[22:52:48] <drojas> prefixed: .jplayer.active
[22:52:57] <prefixed> yeah, got it
[22:52:58] <prefixed> cool!
[22:53:04] <drojas> the space denote parenting
[22:53:20] <prefixed> oh!
[22:53:22] <prefixed> yes it does
[22:53:27] <prefixed> wow, I totally forgot that
[22:53:30] <Cork> no it denote sub tree
[22:53:35] <Cork> > denote parenting
[22:54:36] <Cork> <div class="jplayer"><div><div><div><div><div><div class="active"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> will still select active
[22:56:24] <Eshu> HI Guy's
[22:56:30] <Eshu> Cork: HI Cork
[22:57:38] <Cork> ello
[23:25:56] <prefixed> how would I go about pulling the width value out of the following: style="width: 71.66665649414063%;
[23:30:04] <tw2113> try and pull the parent container width and use that percent with it to do the math?
[23:31:20] <prefixed> oh man
[23:31:36] <prefixed> this is going to be a problem
[23:32:46] <prefixed> ok, so this is the DOM
[23:32:46] <prefixed> <div id="jplayer-1542-field-music-player-0-volume-bar-value" class="jp-volume-bar-value" style="width: 50%; "></div>
[23:33:06] <prefixed> so I would normally do something like .css(width)
[23:33:47] <prefixed> however, it appears that .css(width) matches a CSS rule in the css file instead
[23:33:49] <tw2113> certainly there should be some way to use js to get the computed width
[23:33:56] <tw2113> no matter what the style "shows"
[23:35:55] <sre_> any examples on writing big jquery based applications
[23:36:30] <oojacoboo> anyone using thisâ€¦ http://code.google.com/p/jquery-validation-php-plugin/
[23:37:09] <NewinJquery> What are dom objects ? can anyone ecplain me
[23:37:19] <oojacoboo> NewinJquery, <div>
[23:37:25] <oojacoboo> that's a DOM object
[23:37:31] <oojacoboo> kinda
[23:37:36] <NewinJquery> okey
[23:38:04] <oojacoboo> it's an element, but the DOM builds an object on it and it contains other variables and such
[23:38:29] <NewinJquery> oojacoboo ; any example
[23:38:47] <oojacoboo> NewinJquery, check out the inspector in your browser and you'll see the object in there
[23:39:05] <NewinJquery> yes i can see
[23:39:08] <NewinJquery> <html>
[23:39:13] <NewinJquery> <body>
[23:39:37] <NewinJquery> oojacoboo:
[23:39:55] <NewinJquery> they all are dom objects?
[23:40:16] <oojacoboo> yes
[23:40:20] <oojacoboo> Chrome?
[23:40:29] <NewinJquery> yes Chrome
[23:40:40] <oojacoboo> look on the right and find the "Properties" dropdown
[23:40:48] <oojacoboo> you'll see all the elements of the object in there
[23:42:09] <NewinJquery> oojacoboo: yes there are lot's of objects
[23:42:34] <oojacoboo> yea, im out, you should learn html/css first ;)
[23:42:39] <NewinJquery> Like AddEvent: and all that
[23:43:11] <NewinJquery> oojacoboo : i last question
[23:43:16] <prefixed> ok
[23:43:41] <NewinJquery> oojacoboo: what are the difference b/w Dom objects and jquery objects
[23:43:43] <prefixed> so how do I get the style of an element within the DOM itself (not the CSS stylesheet). i.g. <div id="jplayer-1542-field-music-player-0-volume-bar-value" class="jp-volume-bar-value" style="width: 50%; "></div>
[23:44:22] <vlad27aug> prefixed: .attr('style') should work
[23:44:29] <NewinJquery> oojacoboo  ?
[23:45:07] <prefixed> vlad27aug I get 'undefined'
[23:45:14] <vlad27aug> NewinJquery: the essential difference is that a jquery object is a collection of DOM objects
[23:45:53] <NewinJquery> thnx vlad27aug
[23:46:46] <vlad27aug> prefixed: that means you didn't select the correct element...or the selected element doesn't have a 'style' attribute
[23:47:07] <prefixed> vlad27aug this is the element:
[23:47:07] <prefixed> <div id="jplayer-1542-field-music-player-0-volume-bar-value" class="jp-volume-bar-value" style="width: 50%; "></div>
[23:47:28] <prefixed> as you can see, style is set
[23:47:44] <vlad27aug> $(#jplayer-1542-field-music-player-0-volume-bar-value').attr('style')
[23:47:58] <prefixed> actually, I need to do it by class
[23:47:58] <vlad27aug> $('#jplayer-1542-field-music-player-0-volume-bar-value').attr('style')
[23:48:03] <vlad27aug> or by class
[23:48:11] <prefixed> hm
[23:48:15] <vlad27aug> $('jp-volume-bar-value').attr('style')
[23:48:20] <vlad27aug> $('.jp-volume-bar-value').attr('style')
[23:48:23] <vlad27aug> missed a dot
[23:48:31] <prefixed> var currentVolume = $(wrapper).find('.jp-volume-bar-value').attr('style');
[23:48:34] <prefixed> that's what I have
[23:49:02] <vlad27aug> make a console.log($(wrapper).find('.jp-volume-bar-value').length) and make sure you select anything
[23:49:20] <Eshu> how to access the Day from these json[     {         "MonthName": null,         "days": {             "Day": 1,             "Date": "/Date(1337926223765+0530)/"         }]
[23:49:53] <Eshu> [  {"MonthName": null,"days": { "Day": 1,"Date": "/Date(1337926223765+0530)/"}]
[23:50:47] <vlad27aug> var json = '[  {"MonthName": null,"days": { "Day": 1,"Date": "/Date(1337926223765+0530)/"}]'; var obj = $.parseJSON(json); console.log(obj.days['Day']);
[23:50:49] <prefixed> vlad27aug anything?
[23:50:57] <prefixed> length = 1
[23:51:21] <vlad27aug> prefixed: that means you have an element selected
[23:51:24] <Eshu> thnx vlad27aug
[23:51:37] <vlad27aug> prefixed: and .attr('style') gives you undefined?
[23:51:49] <vlad27aug> on that selector
[23:52:04] <prefixed> vlad27aug for the record, here is the site: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/# and here is the code: http://pastebin.com/kqsBbhQk
[23:52:27] <prefixed> that's correct
[23:53:47] <raj> I'm cloning a div in the vars. Then, I am altering the original div. However, when I replaceWith the cloned div, the cloned div actually looks like the changed original div
[23:53:50] <raj> wsup with that?
[23:53:56] <vlad27aug> if you have an element selected and the .attr('style') returns undefined means that you don't have a 'style' attribute set on that element
[23:54:33] <prefixed> vlad27aug I'm looking at the style attribute in the DOM right now
[23:54:39] <tga> how would you develop a jqmobile app with a few pages? have them independent or grouped into one file?
[23:54:52] <raj> holy crap
[23:54:55] <vlad27aug> maybe you set it dinamically and it isn't there when you execute the code
[23:54:56] <raj> it's all questions tonight
[23:54:58] <prefixed> vlad27aug <div id="jplayer-1540-field-music-player-0-volume-bar-value" class="jp-volume-bar-value" style="width: 50%; "></div>
[23:55:24] <prefixed> that's not goood
[23:55:32] <Eshu> How to create dynamic div with some attributes
[23:57:26] <raj> Cork, are you around?
[23:57:37] <vlad27aug> prefixed: http://jsfiddle.net/4W8HX/1/
[23:57:41] <Cork> sure
[23:57:57] <raj> awesome
[23:58:01] <raj> :)
[23:58:13] <Eshu> Hey Raj
[23:58:17] <raj> I'm cloning a div, but that cloned div seems to change when i change the original div
[23:58:24] <prefixed> vlad27aug balls
[23:58:26] <tw2113> oh shiz... raj is here now
[23:58:27] <tw2113> :P
[23:58:31] <raj> is that normal?
[23:58:40] <tw2113> we're both regulars in here ;)
[23:58:42] <Cork> raj: do you have a demo?
[23:58:42] <prefixed> well, this is a problem then, isn't it
[23:58:51] <raj> tw2113, a little inebriated, but yes :)
[23:59:20] <vlad27aug> prefixed: there is a problem somewhere in your code...but it's too much code to read...you are on your own :)
[23:59:27] <prefixed> yeah, I know
[23:59:30] <prefixed> shoot
