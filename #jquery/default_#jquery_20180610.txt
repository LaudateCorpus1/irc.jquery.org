[10:03:37] <Azrael_-> hi

[10:10:31] <neo4> Azrael_-: do you know how to make containers to change size like on feedle?
[10:10:37] <neo4> I need the same change for my chat
[10:11:37] <neo4> I did markup using flexbox
[10:11:44] <neo4> and now nothing works
[10:12:09] <neo4> flex-basis doesn't work properly
[10:12:18] <neo4> it's not like with
[10:15:45] <neo4> codepan looks like use flexbox for his UI, I need the same https://codepen.io/rstrahl/pen/eJZQej
[10:19:18] <neo4> ordinal resize use $( '.bl1' ).css( "width", e.pageX+2 );
[10:22:38] <Azrael_-> ne018: no clue
[10:23:14] <neo4> guys, I have for you a simple task, it's to make resize in two variants vertical and horizontal by using jquery for flex-box
[10:24:17] <Azrael_-> http://jsfiddle.net/53hg1Lqj/ <-- i've set the paragraph to have a min-width. but the min-width ignores the floated div. is it possible to have the paragraph jump completely below the div if the min-width isn't possible any more (if the window gets too narrow)?
[10:24:52] <neo4> Azrael_-: no, I found https://codepen.io/rstrahl/pen/eJZQej
[10:25:09] <neo4> I show it and didn't noticed there is made code, what I need
[10:25:54] <neo4> Azrael_-: vertical and horizontal
[10:26:18] <Azrael_-> is your link for my or your question?
[10:26:50] <neo4> Azrael_-: what is your question? How to put paragraf under div?
[10:26:56] <neo4> put there <br>
[10:27:28] <Azrael_-> i only want to put the paragraf below the div if the remaining width next to the div is below the min-width
[10:27:33] <neo4> Azrael_-: sorry, I badly know css :(
[10:27:50] <Azrael_-> k
[10:27:57] <neo4> you need track with
[10:28:24] <neo4> and then when with low you need to change css
[10:28:25] <Azrael_-> ups, just realized i'm in #jquery, not #css. sorry
[10:28:48] <neo4> Azrael_-: it's relate to jquery too, do you want to do it by using jquery?
[10:29:19] <neo4> Azrael_-: or ok, in css exists @media, better to use them
[10:30:29] <neo4> Azrael_-: are you css learner? What is now more popular flex or float?
[10:30:42] <neo4> What do you use?
[10:31:11] <Azrael_-> ne018: here is a solution: https://css-tricks.com/minimum-paragraph-widths/
[10:31:23] <Azrael_-> i do a little bit of everything
[10:33:19] <neo4> Azrael_-: yes, css, html and jquery is very important things, you have to learn it cause it used anywhere in php, node.js, any app you will do and you will know them
[10:36:39] <neo4> Azrael_-: see http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/example.html
[10:36:47] <neo4> so many things have already done
[10:36:50] <neo4> looks like chat
[10:38:06] <neo4> Azrael_-: or this, https://golden-layout.com/
[10:38:49] <neo4> I might not do anything manually, will use some plugin
[10:41:06] <neo4> amizing thing
[10:41:14] <neo4> underrated
[10:42:38] <neo4> using such a plugins we can easy to create our own codepen or fiddle
[10:42:39] <neo4> :)
[11:07:28] <Azrael_-> you're quite chatty....
[11:14:28] <Woet> Azrael_-: Neo4 is banned from countless IRC channels, he doesn't have many places to go
[11:41:44] <jak2000> hi all
[12:12:22] <Azrael_-> Woet: hehe, ok
[12:13:20] <neo4> I decided to do my own resizer without libs
[12:13:26] <neo4> How to do it?
[12:14:08] <Woet> Azrael_-: you can see why :)
[12:16:12] <jak2000> i use progress bar, (jquery-ui) , not know why: first display the alert and if i click on ACEPT or CANCEL Button then show progressbar, why?   here the code: (see line 25, alert and line 2 the progressbar)   https://paste.debian.net/1028672/
[12:17:06] <Woet> jak2000: please create a test case with only relevant code on www.jsfiddle.net
[12:21:34] <Azrael_-> Woet: yeah, i do. currently he is one of the rare people calling for the ignore-function.
[12:26:59] <Azrael_-> i've got a page where the header is being resized as soon as i scroll down the page a little bit. the resizing is a smooth size-change. i have no clue how it is done. i want to change the behaviour a little bit. any idea where/how i could start looking for?
[13:21:56] <W0LF> I have a mobile menu that I'd like to trigger close one li when another opens, but I can't seem to get code right... the menu can be seen on mobile here - kobejet.com - and I made a pastebin with the code here - https://pastebin.com/SCSgJx2N
[13:28:46] <W0LF> if anyone has a minute to take a peek, I think i'm almost there...I'm just still a newbie and am probably missing something easy
[13:53:51] <jak2000> Woet: here not fail: http://jsfiddle.net/ChQ7B/14/
[13:55:42] <jak2000> but in this code fail: https://paste.debian.net/1028672/  why?
