[19:30:48] <ButtDog> Is there a way to access the file objects of an input? Say someone selects an image for an image field, can I append it to the body without uploading to server?
[19:43:38] <robertmaxrees> ButtDog sure - https://stackoverflow.com/a/17138290/923919 :)
[19:44:01] <ButtDog> robertmaxrees, just found this and implemented it actually!
[19:44:03] <ButtDog> Haha, thanks!
[19:49:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:57:54] <ButtDog> Anyway to resize a <canvas> without it disappearing?
[19:58:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to search google, but it should be pretty straightforward.  wouldn't use jquery for that though
[20:05:18] <ButtDog> Hmm been looking through, cna't find a solution that doesn't wipe canvas
[20:05:59] <robertmaxrees> maybe somebody in ##javascript knows :)
[21:57:20] <ButtDog> I have an image file object inside of an input is it possible to change the width of the image?
[21:57:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm??
[22:01:28] <robertmaxrees> ButtDog gonna have to be more specific.
[22:01:45] <ButtDog> $('#file-input').prop('files')[0]
[22:01:52] <ButtDog> For instance is it possible to set the width on that?
[22:01:57] <robertmaxrees> so you want to edit the actual image file??
[22:02:34] <robertmaxrees> or is this a continuation from what you were doing to earlier to display the image back to the user?
[22:07:02] <ButtDog> Just a continuation
[22:07:10] <ButtDog> Resize the width locally
[22:07:13] <ButtDog> without submitting to backend.
[22:07:50] <robertmaxrees> just of what's being displayed to the user?  then you want to use css to set the width of the <img> or the container you put the img tag in.
[22:08:09] <ButtDog> unfortunatly, I need to resize the image locally before submitting to server.
[22:08:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a trivial thing to do.
[22:08:27] <robertmaxrees> why not have it resized on the server?
[22:08:33] <robertmaxrees> or just reject the image if it's too large?
[22:10:36] <jak2000> hi, where can paste a Json?
[22:11:04] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 bpaste, jsfiddle. dpaste...
[22:11:46] <jak2000> not know if help me see:
[22:11:55] <ButtDog> robertmaxress ya, I couldn't agree more
[22:12:23] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f02rqk49/  in console of chrome tell me:
[22:12:41] <jak2000> VM43682:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token A in JSON at position 11704
[22:12:46] <jak2000> how to find the item with error?
[22:12:54] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 for starters, that's not JSON.
[22:13:21] <jak2000> bad past
[22:13:38] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 secondly, are you trying to share the json, or validate it?
[22:13:46] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f02rqk49/3/
[22:13:52] <jak2000> is valid...
[22:14:08] <robertmaxrees> "461":" GIESBRECHT GIESBRECHT ABRAM INDUSTRIAS ""AGRA KING""",
[22:14:08] <jak2000> i checkd here:  https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#
[22:14:11] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue
[22:14:22] <robertmaxrees> those extra double quotes are your problem.
[22:14:31] <robertmaxrees> item with error?
[22:14:31] <robertmaxrees> [2021:02:28:19:16:20] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 for
[22:14:34] <robertmaxrees> woops
[22:14:53] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x9cnbyL4/ - go here and scroll down until you see the red dot jak2000
[22:16:28] <jak2000> yes i found....
[22:16:56] <robertmaxrees> also that validator you linked throws an error for the JSON you put in that fiddle :)
[22:21:51] <jak2000> checking
[22:22:02] <jak2000> is possible fix the json?
[22:22:13] <jak2000> or only removing the doble quotes?
[22:22:30] <robertmaxrees> need to escape the double quotes.
[22:23:12] <robertmaxrees> so for each " you have in a string, you need to put a \ in front of it.
[22:23:27] <robertmaxrees> so ""AGRA KING"" becomes \"\"AGRA KING\"\"
[22:28:16] <jak2000> good
[22:28:20] <jak2000> i am starter?
[22:28:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:30:46] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what are you asking?
[22:31:04] <jak2000> forget:)
[22:31:08] <jak2000> ddone the job :)
[22:31:10] <robertmaxrees> k...
[22:31:15] <jak2000> with your help, thanks
[22:31:31] <robertmaxrees> have you done any javascript tutorials or anything?
[22:32:12] <jak2000> a  little
[22:32:27] <robertmaxrees> heh alright.
[22:36:16] <jak2000> my String " GIESBRECHT GIESBRECHT ABRAM INDUSTRIAS "AGRA KING""
[22:36:39] <robertmaxrees> what about it?
[22:37:36] <jak2000> then i need ask: if  (myString.indexOf("\"")!=-1)  {
[22:37:39] <jak2000> right?
[22:37:49] <robertmaxrees> wait what??
[22:37:56] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to fix the JSON via javascript??
[22:38:31] <jak2000> no in java Code..
[22:38:49] <robertmaxrees> so you're asking how to fix JSON using java in a channel about jquery ;)
[22:39:06] <jak2000> yes, you know java i am sure, not?
[22:39:29] <robertmaxrees> i don't, but it wouldn't matter since this is #jquery lol.
[22:39:37] <jak2000> okay :)
[22:39:51] <jak2000> join to java channel
[22:39:52] <robertmaxrees> either way - are these strings stored in a DB with these extra quotes?
[22:39:59] <jak2000> yes
[22:40:27] <robertmaxrees> because if so, just properly escape them - the library you're using to create your JSOn should help.
[22:40:46] <robertmaxrees> if you aren't using a library to generate your JSON, then that's a problem :)
[22:41:03] <jak2000> no library
[22:41:05] <jak2000> :(
[22:41:06] <jak2000> manually
[22:41:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a problem.
[22:41:46] <robertmaxrees> this is a great example of why.
[22:42:01] <jak2000> i think in learn gson library
[22:42:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm sure there are tons of good options out there.  pick one and let that do the heavy lifting.
[22:43:22] <jak2000> ok, you know i am need solve the problem... tomorrow learn gson...
[22:43:39] <robertmaxrees> for future reference, try asking in channels relevant to the topic.
[22:43:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:46:56] <jak2000> ok
[23:03:56] <jak2000> done!!! thanks
