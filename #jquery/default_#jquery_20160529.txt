[09:05:38] <Pazician> what's wrong with this script? https://pastee.org/tpnpr
[09:06:28] <Pazician> it doesn't load the .php file, nor does it not run the queries in my php file
[09:21:24] <negatratoron> hey, i've got a question about the api
[09:21:45] <negatratoron> i've got a promise returned by a $.ajax method.  it is failing, and the failure value is itself.
[09:22:03] <negatratoron> why is the failure value itself?  that seems odd.
[09:35:53] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know an alternative to this? http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/ - it seems no longer maintained
[10:09:30] <ales> is codeacademy bugged ..? http://pastie.org/10856910
[10:13:35] <shoky> negatratoron: there's more than one argument to the failure callback, see the docs for "error" option of $.ajax
[10:28:00] <negatratoron> oh okay
[10:28:44] <negatratoron> when is codeacademy not bugged?

[12:30:44] <wyk3d> hi! .. if i'm getting dispatchEvent is not a function but i'm not using prototype.js , the only library listed for the chrome content script is jquery, then what else could the problem be ?
[14:40:13] <Lencl> Does .parent('.className') keep going up until it reaches the parent with that className?
[14:40:23] <Lencl> meaning, even if it's a grandparent?
[14:41:20] <chee> Lencl: no
[14:41:28] <Lencl> Oh
[14:41:35] <Lencl> so what's the point of putting a classname?
[14:42:02] <chee> Lencl: you can use .closest('.className') for that behaviour
[14:42:55] <Lencl> ah I see
[14:43:05] <Lencl> but what's the point of putting anything between parent(..)?
[14:43:30] <chee> Lencl: it's a test really. you want to do function x(node) { node.parent('.lol').remove() } or something
[14:43:41] <chee> so it only does it if the parent is .lol
[14:43:57] <Lencl> ah
[14:44:04] <Lencl> makes sense thx :]
[14:44:10] <chee> (: np
[16:54:06] <dochttpd> hi, i'm new to jquery and ajaz and im trying to post data to a php function. however, i'm unable to figure out what's wrong with my syntax because i know it's not posting to the php function. here's my code - http://pastie.org/10857248
[16:54:19] <dochttpd> can someone please tell me what im doing wrong?
[16:57:59] <lalalaaa> I'm using embedly-jquery embed YouTube URLs: https://jsfiddle.net/lalala1234/bLhsg4qe/ -- but every time the user reloads, embedly-jquery has to re-fetch the YouTube thumbnails etc., which is unnecessary and costs a lot of money. So instead, how to cache these YouTube embeds?
[16:58:12] <shoky> dochttpd: make sure the element exists when you add the click handler (i.e. do it in a dom.ready block or make sure the script is after the element), and you're probably missing quotes around that current_url php thing. you should show us the actual js that is in the page, not your php code
[16:58:54] <shoky> dochttpd and of course check your console for errors and check for the request in the devtools network tab
[16:59:07] <shoky> and add an error handler
[16:59:36] <lalalaaa> shoky :)
[16:59:46] <lalalaaa> Remember when we worked on Embedly arrays? lol
[16:59:50] <lalalaaa> Good times
[16:59:57] <dochttpd> shoky: thanks, i'll try that! (Y)
[17:00:18] <shoky> lalalaaa rings a bell i guess ;p
[17:00:40] <lalalaaa> shoky: Well not I need to cache it -- that stuff is hella expensive !!
[17:00:52] <lalalaaa> * shoky: Well now I need to cache it -- that stuff is hella expensive !!
[17:03:56] <shoky> lalalaaa: do you mean the images themselves? or the metadata for each vid?
[17:05:58] <shoky> cause the images are cached by the browser, that's its job
[17:06:23] <shoky> gtg for a bit
[17:24:28] <lalalaaa> shoky: I see. I reckon metadata then!
[17:41:48] <kneekoo> test
[17:46:09] <lalalaaa> shoky: Prevent making new requests to Embedly at least
[17:51:13] <fas3r> hello
[17:51:48] <fas3r> is it possible to prependTo to a class but only to the first element ?
[17:52:06] <fas3r> (can not put id)
[18:08:50] <shoky> lalalaaa: so you don't know and are just prematurely optimizing?
[18:09:06] <shoky> protip - don't
[18:27:01] <JavaLover> is hiding an element pretty much the same thing as changing it with $('#myelement').html('newhtmlhere');
[18:27:18] <JavaLover> or is changing it, really slow & hiding faster?
[18:48:36] <lalalaaa> shoky: thanks
