[00:01:52] <wa5ted> VectorX: why do you need to change order?
[00:01:54] <soee> Cork: something like http://jsfiddle.net/6Vex2/
[00:02:23] <VectorX> wa5ted coz thats the desired output
[00:02:29] <soee> iv changed hidden field to text
[00:02:31] <wa5ted> why though
[00:03:06] <VectorX> thats what is passed to the function that processes it
[00:03:17] <soee> smal update: http://jsfiddle.net/6Vex2/1/
[00:03:19] <wa5ted> well then right antoher function
[00:03:29] <wa5ted> that is added at the end fo the main function that change the order
[00:03:41] <wa5ted> basically rewires theJSON isit?
[00:03:41] <Cork> soee: http://jsfiddle.net/6Vex2/2/
[00:04:08] <Cork> soee: so ya, it works fine here
[00:04:52] <VectorX> wa5ted the top array is what i create based on some other data which has two formats, so i am making a uniform list then i need to get the relavent data to the other format which is the bottom example
[00:05:53] <wa5ted> so you are removing regions  to get the below array
[00:05:59] <wa5ted> from the upper one  correct?
[00:06:01] <VectorX> yeah
[00:06:55] <wa5ted> so call it
[00:06:58] <SledgeSRV> wa5ted: do u have an answer for me?
[00:07:14] <wa5ted> SledgeSRV: naw bro
[00:07:32] <wa5ted> VectorX: its JSON right?
[00:07:41] <wa5ted> SledgeSRV: sorry man
[00:07:45] <VectorX> yes
[00:07:52] <SledgeSRV> wa5ted: its all good
[00:08:10] <wa5ted> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5310304/remove-json-element
[00:08:13] <wa5ted> VectorX: ^ eprhaps
[00:08:17] <wa5ted> perhaps*
[00:08:34] <wa5ted> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9187337/jquery-javascript-remove-object-data-from-json-object
[00:10:33] <VectorX> oops my bad, i forgot to mention i have to do it in pure js, but ill try doing a loop and seeing if i can create a new JSON object
[00:11:00] <VectorX> just wanted to check if there was a better way to do it without using a loop though
[00:12:28] <wa5ted> well if you know its called region everytime
[00:12:32] <wa5ted> you could directcall it
[00:12:40] <wa5ted> delete obj.region
[00:13:02] <wa5ted> and json is js
[00:13:12] <wa5ted> so i dont know what you are talking about pure js
[00:13:20] <wa5ted> that jquery solution can be adapted to js
[00:13:26] <wa5ted> VectorX: ^
[00:13:57] <VectorX> wa5ted pure js as in without using any libs like jquery
[00:14:08] <wa5ted> it still can be doen
[00:14:13] <wa5ted> i beleive you sohuld be able to do
[00:14:17] <wa5ted> if you use a variable
[00:14:30] <wa5ted> for the orignal generated output json object
[00:14:40] <wa5ted> you cna use a variable to stor the modified one
[00:14:45] <wa5ted> and then do something like
[00:15:00] <wa5ted> delete ojb.region
[00:15:08] <wa5ted> delete obj.region
[00:15:18] <wa5ted> VectorX: ^
[00:16:40] <VectorX> ok let me look that up
[00:17:40] <wa5ted> kk
[00:17:53] <wa5ted> im heading to bed
[00:17:54] <wa5ted> yawn
[00:18:11] * wa5ted yawns and drops to sleep

[00:53:37] <K4T> How I can remove hover effect on element which was moved from under mouse pointer?
[01:27:00] <Cork> K4T: depends on how the hover effect was added
[01:43:18] <milissa> http://adf.ly/pyduc
[01:47:59] <Cork> yay for spammers
[02:14:03] <soee> how can i implode selected values of multiselec dropdown element ?
[02:15:30] <Cork> soee: do it the same way you did it for the checkboxes
[02:15:53] <soee> Cork: aerializaArray() will work her e ?
[02:16:16] <Cork> soee: serializeArray() works for all form elements (except disabled ones)
[02:17:12] <soee> Cork: ok thank you
[02:57:14] <mikunos> hi guys is this possible? $('select[name="address[region_id]"]').val();  ?

[02:59:07] <mikunos> any idea?
[02:59:08] <Cork> mikunos: http://jsfiddle.net/CTGsL/
[02:59:48] <JKABC> it said works on my browser
[03:00:13] <mikunos> yes right
[03:00:17] <mikunos> mumble!
[03:00:23] <mikunos> :|
[03:01:30] <JKABC> maybe try your code on a browser without plugin?
[03:01:44] <JKABC> i mean browser plugin
[03:02:14] <JKABC> eg. some extensions on browser can modify your DOM
[03:02:38] <Cork> the error isn't from modified dom
[03:02:43] <Cork> its a js parser error
[03:05:06] <JKABC> mmm, right
[03:05:09] <mikunos> solved
[03:05:15] <mikunos> my fault! as usual!
[03:05:20] <JKABC> what's the cause~?
[03:05:36] <mikunos> wrong name selection thanks guys

[03:29:03] <[1]domino> also if i had uploade them
[03:36:59] <gbro> I'm in the process of converting a script to a more modular format but its causing issues with my code. I get the error "cannot read property 'find' of undefined" when I call $variable.find('x'). This error can be fixed by using this format instead $($variable).find('x'), but obviously I would like to avoid having to go through my code and changing it to suit this format. Any ideas how to fix this?
[03:38:23] <|RicharD|> hi
[03:39:49] <|RicharD|> I have a simple form where I want interrupt the action of submitting when a User submit the form
[03:39:53] <|RicharD|> I tried with: https://gist.github.com/riccardoa/7d7d0faf655b91de3325
[03:39:59] <Cork> gbro: in the cases where $variable isn't defined set it to $variable = $();
[03:40:18] <|RicharD|> but anyway it submit the form :( instead if I use .click the preventDefault works fine
[03:40:48] <Cork> |RicharD|: is .wform the form or a button?
[03:40:55] <|RicharD|> the form
[03:41:08] <[1]domino> hi cork, can you take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/e2CP8/ after?
[03:41:16] <Cork> |RicharD|: try reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[03:41:24] <Cork> |RicharD|: cause that code should work
[03:41:40] <Cork> [1]domino: you need to ask the question first
[03:41:59] <|RicharD|> Cork: ok
[03:42:05] <[1]domino> how i can make input file know that file as been uploaded
[03:42:17] <[1]domino> i mean if i press insert in the form
[03:42:27] <[1]domino> is still required
[03:42:58] <[1]domino> "append only if i use drag and drop" if i use file choser the required field fork ok
[03:45:35] <Cork> [1]domino: you can't as far as i know
[03:45:53] <[1]domino> a work around?
[03:45:55] <Cork> [1]domino: your best option is to display the file manually and not show the file picker
[03:46:52] <[1]domino> can explain it better?
[04:03:23] <tiblock> this world is so bad because of IE8. I set html('...') then i get it back with html() and there is not mine code, its messed up, <a href="/" class="myclass"> become <A class=myclass href="/"> man this is bad
[04:03:46] <tiblock> just throwing off my pain
[04:11:45] <marcules> tiblock, why does the order of attributes matter?
[04:12:29] <tiblock> marcules, for regexp parsing because i need parse 4000 blocks of code and fastest way is to parse it
[04:13:35] <marcules> Couldn't you use xpath?
[04:14:54] <basiclases> hey, is there a smooth div scroll-to feature in jquery?
[04:15:14] <xec> basiclases: no, but there is a plugin http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[04:15:20] <tiblock> basiclases, i bet there is plugin for that
[04:18:56] <Cork> tiblock: if the source is dom objects it should be fast to do it with querySelectorAll too
[04:18:57] <prai> hello everybody :)
[04:19:02] <prai> I have a simple question is it possible to use original browser scrollbar to scroll content in some div on website ?
[04:19:32] <Cork> xec: well you do have animate({ scrollTop: }, time)
[04:19:46] <tiblock> Cork, i will look at it, thank you
[04:20:12] <Cork> prai: not fully sure what you mean, but as you stated the question; sure
[04:20:45] <tiblock> prai, do you talking about overflow: scroll?
[04:21:17] <tiblock> prai, lets put it other way - if you dont know about "overflow: scroll" then this is the answer
[04:21:37] <prai> tiblock: something like that but I dont want to have scrollbar next to element
[04:22:43] <prai> tiblock it have to look like scrolling all site not only one element
[04:22:44] <tiblock> prai, so you want element on one place and scrollbar on other?
[04:23:45] <tiblock> prai, or you want block scroll of element? Im not sure what you want
[04:24:18] <basiclases> Cork: i read that the easing feature of jquery should be suitable :)
[04:24:53] <prai> tiblock, maybe i will show you, okey ? :)
[04:24:58] <prai> one moment :)
[04:25:46] <hnkumar> I've 4 drop down.  2nd drop down based on 1st, 3rd based on 2nd and 4th based on 2nd.  It is working fine if didn't prepolute
[04:26:00] <hnkumar> if i do prepopulate then it is only filling 2nd one
[04:26:08] <hnkumar> 3rd & 4th is not filling

[04:29:47] <jeffreylevesque> I'm not sure how Grunt install works if you fork it from GitHub (https://github.com/gruntjs).  I need  sass, js minification - but, I'm not sure which to fork?
[04:31:38] <Cork> basiclases: http://jsfiddle.net/z8JS3/
[04:36:54] <prai> tiblock, http://imgur.com/S1AxDjB
[04:37:50] <tiblock> prai, you can set "overflow: hidden" for <body> and that will disable scroll of page but will keep scroll of element
[04:38:45] <tiblock> prai, but if you want keep scrollbar i cant give you easy solution
[04:40:00] <axscode> hi guys i have this as event e . e.target.parentElement.parentElement  how is it possible to do .animate() or .hide() in this target element?  i can use .remove() but other function it says unidentified function.
[04:40:20] <tiblock> axscode, use $(e.target.parentElement.parentElement).animate()
[04:40:37] <axscode> ahh really nice ill try
[04:40:38] <Cork> axscode: $(e.target).parent().parent().animate()
[04:40:53] <axscode> wow deym...
[04:40:53] <prai> thanks anyway
[04:41:02] <Cork> axscode: or better $(e.target).closest('selector').animate()
[04:41:35] <axscode> so can i do $(e.target).parent('tr').animiate() right ?
[04:41:45] <Cork> no
[04:41:51] <Cork> closest works though
[04:42:02] <Cork> parent() checks if the parent is a tr
[04:42:07] <Cork> and if it isn't returns nothing
[04:42:16] <Cork> closest finds the closest parent matching the selector
[04:42:22] <axscode> ic
[04:46:09] <axscode> wow im so happy, thanks Cork and tiblock
[04:46:19] <tiblock> np
[04:46:28] <axscode> awesome..
[04:49:43] <axscode> hi guys, i wanted to delete a row, anyone one knows an effect like, its like it blinks before it fadeOut and remove
[04:49:57] <axscode> row means tr in table.
[04:50:29] <tiblock> axscode, im not sure, but did you tried? https://api.jquery.com/slideup/
[04:51:39] <axscode> fadeOut() and remove() almost same effect. though with slideup, wanted to blink before remove.. anyways thanks a lot
[04:52:25] <tiblock> axscode, so your problem is you need "blink" effect?
[04:52:41] <axscode> yep before fadeIn and remove
[04:53:06] <Cork> axscode: you need to wait for the animation to finish before you run .remove()
[04:53:26] <Cork> if you run $().fadeOut().remove()
[04:53:30] <axscode> i did that Cork, fadeOut(1000,function(){ i remove });
[04:53:34] <Cork> it will run as if you didn't have fadeOut there at all
[04:54:29] <Cork> axscode: $().fadeOut(100).fadeIn(100).fadeout(100).fadeIn(100, function() { $(this).remove(); }); ?
[04:54:43] <axscode> looks awesome already. but it seems it didn't  to catchy that that row was the one removed
[04:54:53] <axscode> ah ill try
[04:55:13] <Cork> heh except i did fadeIn before i removed it -_-'
[04:58:24] <axscode> haH! perfect Cork..
[04:59:11] <axscode>  $(e.target).closest('tr').fadeOut(100).fadeIn(100).fadeOut(100).fadeIn(100).fadeOut(1000, function() { $(e.target).closest(tr).remove() });
[04:59:37] <axscode> perfect! really awesome..
[04:59:38] <Cork> axscode: $(e.target).closest(tr).remove() can just be $(this).remove()
[04:59:46] <Cork> they are the same thing
[05:01:44] <decx> you can also add a class with a transition or animation for more control and remove on animationend
[05:02:17] <axscode> Cork, just asking, if i have    $('.selector01').each(function() { $(this).find('a', function(){ $(this).remove();  }); });
[05:02:43] <axscode> does the second $(this) refer to the result of the find ?
[05:02:44] <Cork> find('a', function(){ $(this).remove();  }); }); <-- this doesn't make sense
[05:02:53] <Cork> find doens't take a function
[05:03:01] <axscode> ah yes just for example.
[05:03:08] <Cork> then no
[05:03:14] <Cork> this is local to every function
[05:03:15] <axscode> just pointing the second $(this)
[05:03:21] <axscode> ahhhhhhhhhh
[05:03:29] <axscode> that clears it
[05:03:34] <Cork> so every time you define a function() {} this is separate
[05:03:45] <axscode> ic ic ic.
[05:03:50] <Cork> and the function calling the function specify "this"
[05:03:57] <Cork> and if it doesn't it is ALWAYS "window"
[05:04:11] <axscode> ic
[05:04:24] <Cork> so the first and second this is never the same
[05:04:43] <Cork> unless the function you pass the function to explicitly makes them the same
[05:04:52] <axscode> thanks a lot. that clears, i tried to put this on var so i thought its something same
[05:05:12] <Amnesia> Cork question, since firefox transparently follows redirects, it's unable for me to detect that the user's session timed out (it redirects to /), so how could I somehow detect whether the session has timed out?
[05:05:17] <decx> axscode here's a css variant to ponder about http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fM7aB/
[05:05:48] <Cork> Amnesia: the server could set a header and you could check for that header
[05:06:07] <axscode> wow thats soo cool decx
[05:06:14] <Amnesia> Cork: ah good one, ty
[05:06:27] <Cork> decx: nice one :)
[05:06:45] <axscode> deym... really so coooooOOLL!
[05:07:00] <Cork> doens't work in pre ie10 though
[05:07:08] <decx> the remove would need a fallback though because animationend is a bit exotic
[05:07:10] <decx> indeed
[05:07:28] <Cork> and ya the namespaces on animationend is... >_<'''
[05:07:33] <axscode> this is cross browser right?
[05:07:38] <axscode> ahh
[05:07:43] <axscode> hmmmm....
[05:07:55] <dawie4343> Is there anything wrong with this : $("clickme").click(function() {   I keep getting an error message about missing } despite a }); being present to matchup with this.
[05:08:21] <Cork> axscode: oAnimationend oanimationEnd oAnimationEnd webkitAnimationend webkitAnimationEnd animationend
[05:08:24] <Cork> (opera was a pain here)
[05:08:36] <decx> lol
[05:08:42] <axscode> hmmm omy
[05:08:42] <Cork> if you call that cross browser; then ya :/
[05:09:47] <Cork> axscode: ms and firefox at least only ever used animationend
[05:11:05] <axscode> and no < ei10
[05:11:12] <Cork> yup
[05:11:26] <axscode> hmmm maybe jquery
[05:11:27] <Cork> no css3 support at all pre ie10
[05:11:49] <axscode> hi decx, any jquery version of it for this animate :p
[05:12:48] <Cork> axscode: the animation depends quite a bit on transform
[05:12:55] <Cork> and transform is css3 so not really
[05:13:38] <decx> i'd just use it as flavour, test for transitionEnd and it's variants. if that doesnt exists just remove without the animation
[05:13:47] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here using grunt?
[05:14:01] <slax0r> yep
[05:15:43] <jeffreylevesque> slax0r: I'm not sure what to install (fork) - https://github.com/gruntjs.  I think i need to use sass, and uglify
[05:16:07] <djam90> Does anyone here have an iPad Air and maybe any dev tools they can debug with? could really use some help
[05:16:34] <slax0r> jeffreylevesque: http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt
[05:16:40] <slax0r> you need nodejs and npm
[05:16:51] <slax0r> and for sass, you'll need ruby and compass, most probably
[05:17:21] <jeffreylevesque> slax0r: is the github repo really just for developing?
[05:17:52] <slax0r> jeffreylevesque: you can download it from github and install by hand
[05:18:00] <slax0r> but it's pretty much easier to maintain the version with npm
[05:19:08] <jeffreylevesque> i think i want to do it via github
[05:19:25] <slax0r> why again?
[05:19:41] <jeffreylevesque> I like my application to have a bunch of submodules
[05:19:58] <jeffreylevesque> versioning seems cool
[05:20:19] <slax0r> it's not for the version of _your_ application, but for _grunts_ version
[05:20:32] <slax0r> and you will need the nodejs installed at minimum anyway to run it successfully
[05:20:50] <jeffreylevesque> i installed ruby based things - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/audio-analyzer#installation
[05:45:01] <codepython777> How do i make this search case in-sensitive: $("section[id]:contains('" + qstring + "')"); ? Also, how do i make sure that it also includes the search inside the id tag?
[05:46:06] <Cork> codepython777: :contains() is a short hand for .filter(function() { return $(this).html() == qstring; })
[05:46:17] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with fullcalendar plugin?
[05:46:20] <Cork> so just write you're own filter function
[05:46:40] <Cork> codepython777: though you should prob not do it that way if you can avoid it
[05:46:50] <codepython777> Cork: any other suggestions?
[05:47:03] <Cork> codepython777: depends on what you need to do
[05:47:20] <Cork> but yes there is always preferment ways to do those things
[05:47:43] <codepython777> Cork: I've a large html split using sections. I need to give the user the ability to search a string (like google), and then go and underline that text or take an action
[05:48:05] <codepython777> Cork: only one section is visible at a time
[05:48:45] <Cork> codepython777: hmm and by selecting the text you mean?
[05:49:01] <Cork> wrapping it in a <span> or something?
[05:49:28] <codepython777> I just need to get to the correct section id
[05:49:46] <codepython777> i'd love something like a search engine, but was settling for "contains"
[05:50:17] <Cork> hmm
[05:51:42] <Bloomberg> someone know how to set a specific date for fullcalendar?
[05:52:03] <codepython777> hi Velveeta
[05:52:29] <codepython777> how do i do this case in-sensitive: $("section[id]:contains('" + qstring + "')"); ?
[05:52:31] <Cork> var query = new RegExp(qstring); $("section").filter(function() { return query.test($(this).text()); });
[05:52:36] <Cork> is prob the best you can do
[05:53:19] <Cork> it will give you the section elements that has the text you're looking for
[05:53:19] <marcules> codepython777, at least with selection[id*='yourstring'] you could search for it anywhere in the id
[05:53:34] <Cork> marcules: no anywhere in the attribute
[05:53:38] <Cork> it is NOT searching the id
[05:54:03] <marcules> You would match IDs which contain 'yourstring' - I thought this was what he wanted
[05:54:09] <Cork> no
[05:54:12] <Cork> it matches attributes
[05:54:14] <Cork> not ids
[05:54:35] <Cork> meaning it will grab all elements loop over them fetch the attribute "id" and match in the value if holds
[05:54:36] <marcules> id is an attribute
[05:54:57] <Cork> in the element yes, but the id you normally refer to, the one that gives css speed
[05:54:59] <Cork> is not
[05:55:06] <Cork> it is a hash table in the browser
[05:55:19] <Cork> and that selector works around that optimization
[05:55:29] <Cork> and forces the browser to loop all elements
[05:55:36] <marcules> hm
[05:55:52] <codepython777> Cork: var query = new RegExp(qstring); $("section").filter(function() { return query.test($(this).text()); }); -- this still is case sensitve, right?
[05:56:04] <Cork> codepython777: oh, right forgot
[05:56:41] <Cork> codepython777: var query = new RegExp(qstring, 'i');
[05:56:53] <Cork> you might need g and m too
[05:57:05] <Cork> codepython777: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Advanced_Searching_With_Flags
[05:57:24] <codepython777> thanks
[05:57:44] <marcules> Where's the difference if you grab all sections and filter them, or use the attribute selector? Wouldn't it restrict your attribute-search to the previously selected sections? @Cork
[05:58:19] <Cork> marcules: your code searchs the id attribute, he wants to search the content of the element
[05:58:39] <Cork> marcules: and you should never do [id*=""]
[05:58:57] <Cork> cause EVERY TIME you do you have misunderstood how to use id and classes
[05:59:07] <Cork> cause that is exactly what class is meant to be used for
[06:01:47] <marcules> You don't have to get defensive - I'm not creating a requirement out of fuzzy-id search
[06:02:09] <Cork> marcules: i'm not defensive
[06:02:22] <Cork> but i see this used several times a week
[06:02:26] <marcules> I just didn't correctly read the second half of the sentence
[06:02:42] <Cork> and it needs to be pushed through that it isn't a good way to do things
[06:04:12] <Edvard> hi
[06:05:07] <marcules> Cork, wouldn't your regex ignore the second half "also includes search inside the id tag"?
[06:05:09] <marcules> [14:45] <codepython777> How do i make this search case in-sensitive: $("section[id]:contains('" + qstring + "')"); ? Also, how do i make sure that it also includes the search inside the id tag?
[06:05:38] <Cork> marcules: yes, but i don't think that was what he meant
[06:05:44] <marcules> Ok
[06:05:46] <Cork> so i intentionally skipped that part
[06:16:24] <Absolute0> How do I check if e.target is the body?
[06:16:47] <Cork> abishek: e.target == document.body
[06:16:52] <Cork> *Absolute0:
[06:17:10] <Absolute0> thanks
[06:28:04] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/5vegT/1/
[06:28:19] <Bloomberg> how can I to set default date in that script?
[06:30:07] <kongthap> hi, how can i determine $('#navbar').find('#item'); is found or not ?
[06:30:17] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Check the length.
[06:30:27] <Cork> kongthap: .length
[06:30:56] <BillCriswell> kongthap: If you're using ids you don't really need to use .find('#item'), $('#item') would get exactly what you want.
[06:31:11] <BillCriswell> (This is how I usually discover people mean to be using classes.)
[06:31:11] <kongthap> BillCriswell, i tried var found = $('#navbar_header').find(navItemId).length; but it's error when not found
[06:31:34] <Cork> kongthap: that should never give you error
[06:31:42] <Bloomberg> hey?
[06:31:44] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Yeah, thinking you're doing something else funky.
[06:31:46] <Cork> sounds like you're not using jquery
[06:32:01] <kongthap> BillCriswell, i generate the id from route, so it possible can be not found
[06:32:14] <decx> var found = ($(navItemId).length) ? true : false
[06:32:26] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Found will just return a number, 0 - whatever
[06:32:29] <BillCriswell> In this case 1.
[06:32:44] <BillCriswell> kongthap: You'd have to set up a demo.
[06:33:54] <kongthap> decx, i don't understand i tried var found = ($(navItemId).length) ? true : false but still error when not found (Uncaught Error)
[06:34:16] <decx> i just assumed you use found somewhere else, fiddle up
[06:35:12] <kongthap> everybody my route is #auth/login so $('#auth/login') will cause error? if not found (i meant the /)
[06:35:35] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Yes.
[06:35:47] <BillCriswell> kongthap: http://jsbin.com/fotoroxe/1/edit?html,js,output very basic version of your code.
[06:36:00] <kongthap> so the problem is the /, i must get rid of it
[06:36:10] <kongthap> BillCriswell, thanks so much
[06:36:37] <BillCriswell> kongthap: No problem.
[06:37:03] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/muqicu/4/edit I saw this the other day. I thought it was pretty interesting (putting the route in a <template>'s attribute).
[06:38:45] <kongthap> if i use if ($(navItemId).length) { //how to refer the the navItemId so i can use .addClass() } i tried $this but not working
[06:38:51] <decx> i have no idea what's going on there
[06:39:30] <BillCriswell> decx: <template is="active-view" when="/world">world!</template> is the interesting part (to me)
[06:40:14] <BillCriswell> <template is="active-view" when="/items/(\d+)"> <h1>{{ item.name }}</h1> </template. etc, etc
[06:40:47] <decx> interesting
[06:48:49] <arko__> Does anyone have exprience with jPlayer? On my localhost it is using the .ogv file, but on the staging it uses the .mp4 file (that seems to be broken). Any way I can force it to use ogv?
[07:14:36] <str8uplinux> how can i make this multidimensional array into a multidimensional JSON array instead? http://jsfiddle.net/KkHK4/
[07:16:26] <Cork> str8uplinux: that isn't a multidimensional array
[07:16:33] <Cork> it's an array of objects
[07:17:03] <Cork> str8uplinux: http://jsfiddle.net/KkHK4/1/
[07:17:56] <Cork> str8uplinux: but why don't you just use the name="" field instead of data-name?
[07:18:37] <str8uplinux> Cork: ha.. i feel dumb. thanks. And yes, i will end up using name instead. I was testing something earlier that i needed a custom attr.
[07:18:56] <Cork> str8uplinux: you might want to look into serializeObject
[07:19:02] <Cork> it might make the code nicer for you
[07:19:09] <Cork> ?g jquery serializeObject
[07:19:11] <b-ot> Cork: hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject · GitHub → https://github.com/hongymagic/jQuery.serializeObject
[07:20:46] <str8uplinux> Cork, thanks. I will have a look. I've been looking for an easy way to pass the entire form to php. each table row will be a single insert statement in mysql. There could be up to 14 rows. so writing code for each row is pretty ugly....
[07:21:17] <Cork> str8uplinux: you could have a look at $('form').serializeArray()
[07:21:26] <Cork> it is what serializeObject is built around
[07:21:32] <Cork> and it might give you what you need
[07:21:37] <Cork> (and it is in core)
[07:22:09] <ocm> how can this be? I check pagewidth like this: if ( $(window).outerWidth() <= 760 ) {}
[07:22:15] <str8uplinux> Cork, thanks again!
[07:22:16] <ocm> the width I get is 745
[07:22:25] <ocm> still it returns true
[07:22:27] <ocm> how? :o
[07:22:35] <Cork> ocm: width on window is a bit weird
[07:22:57] <ocm> is it?
[07:22:59] <Cork> i think what you want is.. clientWidth and i'm no sure outerWidth uses that
[07:23:07] <ocm> but still it is weird
[07:23:19] <ocm> $(window).outerWidth() retursn 745
[07:23:22] <ocm> returns*
[07:23:22] <Cork> ocm: the window object is very special, and MUCH of the normal dom things doesn't work the same
[07:23:44] <ocm> but if it returns an integer, why does it gives true on <= 670
[07:23:52] <ocm> oh nvm
[07:23:54] <ocm> I am stupid
[07:24:01] <ocm> 670 !== 760
[07:24:02] <ocm> :o
[07:24:52] <Cork> ocm: and you're sure it is really a number?
[07:25:03] <Cork> and not something like undefined in some cases?
[07:26:22] <str8uplinux> Cork, when testing serializeObject here: http://jsfiddle.net/davidhong/PRpJT/ I get a 403 error when submitting?
[07:27:06] <Cork> str8uplinux: not the cause of the problem; but don't use return false;
[07:27:11] <Cork> it will bite you later
[07:27:18] <Cork> use event.preventDefault()
[07:27:50] <str8uplinux> oh, that was just the link to the example in the link you sent me
[07:28:09] <Cork> str8uplinux: http://jsfiddle.net/PRpJT/72/
[07:28:13] <Cork> and this works just fine here
[07:36:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/G6K6Y/1008/
[07:36:12] <Bloomberg> Guys!!
[07:36:25] <Bloomberg> how can I set the start date?
[07:40:53] <str8uplinux> Cork: that link still doesn't populate the json box at the bottom with anything...
[07:41:11] <Cork> str8uplinux: what browser?
[07:41:17] <str8uplinux> chrome
[07:41:21] <str8uplinux> i tried in IE too
[07:42:41] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: That seems right. Not sure why it's not working.
[07:42:43] <str8uplinux> Cork, it seems to be exactly what i need, but i don't know why it isn't working in the fiddle.
[07:42:47] <Cork> str8uplinux: ah, they are including the js file from the an url with a mimetype not allowed for javascript
[07:42:53] <str8uplinux> ah
[07:42:56] <str8uplinux> gotcha
[07:43:10] <Cork> str8uplinux: "because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled."
[07:43:23] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : works perfect. only I need to change the initial date. not today a specific date
[07:43:42] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: I understand. I don't know why defaultDate isn't working, though.
[07:44:03] <Bloomberg> that's the right format?
[07:44:09] <Bloomberg> of date*
[07:44:28] <decx> set year month date instead
[07:44:56] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/G6K6Y/1013/
[07:45:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Weird, the documentation had that option set exactly like that: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/current_date/defaultDate/
[07:46:00] <decx> maybe fullcalendar.js doesnt include moment.js
[07:46:15] <BillCriswell> It says it's included.
[07:46:38] <BillCriswell> Fuck.
[07:46:40] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[07:46:44] <decx> FullCalendar v1.5
[07:46:55] <decx> that doc is for v2
[07:47:14] <BillCriswell> The v1 is conveniently crossed out haha.
[07:47:20] <decx> hehe
[07:47:27] <BillCriswell> Oh, cause it didn't exist in v1 I guess.
[07:47:34] <decx> there we go
[07:47:38] <BillCriswell> Well now that makes sense.
[07:47:41] <BillCriswell> There you go Bloomberg.
[07:47:49] <decx> logic salvaged
[07:48:00] <Bloomberg> so with defaultDate propertie doesn't works ?
[07:48:07] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You have to include moment.js to set the date with defaultDate
[07:49:21] <BillCriswell> I feel like an idiot reading documenation sometimes.
[07:49:38] <decx> it's a male instinct
[07:50:05] <BillCriswell> If it doesn't answer the question I'm asking in the first paragraph it's useless garbage!
[07:50:25] <decx> i'm smart enough to not have to read all of this !
[07:50:31] <BillCriswell> "However, creating Moments from scratch is sometimes necessary. Since Moment is a dependency of FullCalendar, the global moment constructor will likely be available to you. You should be able to create new Moments from scratch like this:"
[07:50:51] <BillCriswell> But it appears to work without moment, just not... well?
[07:51:46] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg totally ignored the docs. :-p
[07:52:28] <decx> why read yourself when the people in #jquery solve all problems
[07:52:34] <decx> reliance upon the collective
[07:53:00] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/DbQ7CE4.png
[07:53:11] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[07:53:15] <jeffreylevesque> could someone assist me with Grunt?
[07:53:41] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: No luck at #grunt?
[07:53:46] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : you makes works with the defaultDate setting?
[07:53:53] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell: no sir
[07:54:08] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: I'm a gulp man myself... and not too good at that either haha
[07:54:19] <jeffreylevesque> haha, no worries
[07:54:31] <jeffreylevesque> BillCriswell, when I get it working, I will document it :)
[07:57:41] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You have to include moment, jquery and fullcalendar
[07:58:36] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: If you get the files from the download page the order they include things in are like so: http://pastie.org/pastes/9343790/text
[07:59:00] <BillCriswell> So you need moment and jquery before fullcalendar.
[07:59:50] <Bloomberg> Is very weird because I have them include previously!
[08:00:08] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Not in the fiddle you showed us.
[08:00:40] <Bloomberg> in that not
[08:00:45] <Bloomberg> in the real sccript yes
[08:01:08] <BillCriswell> I don't understand what you just said.
[08:01:43] <Bloomberg> In my real script I have included, in this jsfiddleexmaple I forget include
[08:03:43] <duch_kazatel> it's too danged early!
[08:05:04] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha.
[08:05:48] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Are you expecting the date you're setting to highlight yellow?
[08:07:19] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : I'm working with agendaDay available view, I need to show specific date that isn't today for to show all the events setting in this day
[08:07:23] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/G6K6Y/1016/
[08:07:26] <Bloomberg> like this

[08:08:59] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell :http://jsfiddle.net/G6K6Y/1019/
[08:09:02] <Bloomberg> see that
[08:09:10] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:09:12] <Bloomberg> I believe there are some problems with dates
[08:09:24] <BillCriswell> But it's working.
[08:09:37] <Bloomberg> I set month : 1 and show me february
[08:09:52] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: That's just javascript.
[08:09:59] <BillCriswell> Set 0 for january.
[08:10:04] <Bloomberg> start from 0?
[08:10:06] <Bloomberg> ok
[08:10:11] <duch_kazatel> months start from 0, yes.
[08:10:19] <BillCriswell> or use moment like the docs suggest.
[08:10:37] <BillCriswell> If you use moment you can set them like "2014-02-01" or whatever.
[08:11:20] <BillCriswell> I feel like I actualy know how to use FullCalendar now. Thanks Bloomberg!
[08:11:56] <decx> hehe
[08:12:55] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/G6K6Y/1022/
[08:12:58] <BillCriswell> Seems like a pretty sweet plugin.
[08:13:04] <Bloomberg> I already include the moment into the example
[08:13:04] <BillCriswell> or library.
[08:13:09] <Bloomberg> and ... doesn't works
[08:13:27] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Moment needs to be before fullcalendar
[08:14:12] <BillCriswell> So the list from top to bottom should be moment, jquery, fullcalendar
[08:14:17] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/G6K6Y/1023/
[08:14:20] <Bloomberg> ready
[08:14:25] <Bloomberg> but doesn't works
[08:15:33] <BillCriswell> FullCalendar 2.0
[08:15:38] <BillCriswell> You're using 1.5
[08:16:36] <BillCriswell> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/download/ click the link next to latest and that'll give you tons of demos that work and all the dependencies.

[08:18:33] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[08:18:55] <BillCriswell> My friend got 4096. I hate him now.
[08:23:48] <duch_kazatel> i really wish i was better at design sometimes.
[08:24:40] <BillCriswell> I miss doing design.
[08:25:09] <BillCriswell> I can code relatively fast, design on the other hand takes me some time.
[08:27:31] <str8uplinux> Cork, I hope you don't mind that I just direct messaged you.
[08:27:53] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell writing code rarely takes me much time these days unless it's a REALLY funky problem.
[08:28:04] <duch_kazatel> design i'm just sort of derpy with.
[08:28:15] <duch_kazatel> how did you get into design originally?
[08:28:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I liked photoshop haha
[08:28:32] <decx> you would design faster if you do it the same way you program, repeat existing patterns that proved useful in the past
[08:29:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, very true.
[08:29:19] <decx> the creative part is not reinventing the wheel but knowing how you can use patterns in new interesting ways
[08:30:39] <duch_kazatel> decx we're going through a thing right now where we're questioning some of our preexisting patterns because we're not sure if they're very effective.  in some cases, we're positive it's damaing us.
[08:30:43] <duch_kazatel> *damaging
[08:30:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Absolutely. Here goes a design from like 2008 I did: http://i.imgur.com/gYGoBfw.jpg
[08:31:56] <duch_kazatel> but i definitely see the point.
[08:32:00] <decx> always hard to get rid of existing patterns that are embedded deeply, but also foolish to not always question effectivity
[08:32:16] <BillCriswell> and another: http://i.imgur.com/U8m0z0R.jpg
[08:33:06] <duch_kazatel> decx exactly.  we've always been pretty data driven, but we're questioning how we're getting that data, what that data means, etc.
[08:33:49] <BillCriswell> How the hell does stemware have performance.
[08:33:55] <BillCriswell> Whatever.
[08:34:10] <str8uplinux> Is there a way to modify this:  http://jsfiddle.net/sHYDs/1/ to keep each row in it's own object such as: {"trip_date": "6/11/2014","c1": "10.00","c2": "10.00","c3": "12.00"},{"trip_date": "6/11/2014","c1": "10.00","c2": "10.00","c3": "12.00"} ?

[09:04:59] <darkfrog> duch_kazatel: well, by setting the input to 1x1 size and setting its visibility to hidden I was able to make it work....a bit hacky though
[09:09:12] <duch_kazatel> darkfrog there are other options, but why are you trying to hide the input/
[09:35:24] <Moult> assuming the dom item is already there upon page load and not added dynamically, is there any benefit to using $(document).on('click', '.foo', function... instead of $('.foo').click(function ?
[09:36:34] <systemfault> Moult: More flexible… you can add more elements having the same class and they will work. More performant, you only have a single event handler no matter how many elements of that class you have on the page.
[09:36:37] <str8uplinux> shouldn't this work to set the value to 1 on all checked checkboxes? $(':checkbox:is(:checked)').attr('value', 1);
[09:37:13] <Moult> systemfault: so then when should i use $('.foo').click? (click/hover/blur/etc)
[09:37:27] <shoky> str8uplinux: $(':checkbox:checked').val(1)   there's no :is() selector, that would be redundant
[09:37:33] <systemfault> Moult: There’s never a reason to use them
[09:37:53] <systemfault> Moult: Because .click(handler) is just .on(‘click’, handler);
[09:37:56] <str8uplinux> shocky: thanks!
[09:38:00] <str8uplinux> makes sense
[09:40:07] <Moult> systemfault: i see :) why doesn't jquery just get rid of them if they're always inferior?
[09:40:34] <decx> write less do more
[09:40:40] <systemfault> Moult: Some like them because they’re less character to type… Also, the main reason is probably compatibility
[09:41:38] <systemfault> Moult: Personally, I’d rather have them all be .on for consistency.
[09:42:00] <Moult> systemfault: ok, at least i know what to do now :)
[09:51:13] <BillCriswell> Getting a passport is bull shit.
[09:55:12] <duch_kazatel> right?
[09:55:16] <duch_kazatel> kind of harder than it should be.
[09:55:37] <BillCriswell> It just makes me sick I need to pay money to be allowed to leave the country.
[09:57:02] <BillCriswell> That just doesn't feel right.
[09:58:07] <duch_kazatel> word
[10:01:39] <mazpe> is there any way to switch this datetime picker to from military time to am/pm
[10:01:41] <mazpe> http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/
[10:02:15] <mazpe> theres a hours12: true option... but how do i select am/pm?
[10:05:39] <duch_kazatel> mazpe that page gives you instructions on how to use a different parser and even includes an example.
[10:07:49] <Uhkis> "military time" :D
[10:08:13] <Uhkis> that term always cracks me up
[10:08:22] <mazpe> it did... but i didnt understood this part format : 'g:i A'
[10:08:45] <mazpe> Uhkis: assuming theres bastly an american audience.. which i dont know why i would assume that.
[10:09:33] <mazpe> its funny, the client just asked me if i can change it from 'military' time to "standard" time... Military time will cause confusion.
[10:10:10] <mazpe> Uhkis: been raised in Europe... i dont see whats confusing about 13 or putting milk in your cereal or smoking a cigarete with your coffee.
[10:10:16] <nitrospectide> This page has a script (at the very bottom of the attached DRWF.js) that is supposed to add a class to a parent div when a link ("Remove from saved resources list") is clicked, but it's not working. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? http://stage3.hexatrope.com/saved-resources ALSO: You won't have any resources listed on the page unless you go here and click "Add to saved resources list" on one of the items: http://stage3.hexatrope.com/problem-solvi
[10:10:31] <Uhkis> yeah, because 8 makes more sense than 20 ;-)
[10:10:43] <duch_kazatel> depends on where you are in the world.
[10:10:59] <mazpe> lets meet at 1
[10:11:01] <mazpe> 1 what?
[10:11:06] <mazpe> lets meet at 13..
[10:11:08] <mazpe> ok!
[10:11:17] <duch_kazatel> mazpe in the us, we woudn't meet at 1am.
[10:11:29] <mazpe> you dont know the people i know.
[10:11:33] <duch_kazatel> actually..
[10:11:35] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: even in front of a bar? ;)
[10:11:45] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis ;)
[10:11:48] <mazpe> Uhkis: even in front of a bar.. no
[10:11:58] <mazpe> Bar closes at 2am in most of the USA
[10:12:08] <duch_kazatel> mazpe they were being funny.
[10:12:09] <Uhkis> really?
[10:12:13] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis yep.
[10:12:19] <duch_kazatel> lots of places close bars at around 2.
[10:12:39] <Uhkis> last time i went to a bar after 2
[10:12:47] <Uhkis> (finland)
[10:12:54] <mazpe> Uhkis: really... and in Georgia (bible belt) been a dry state.. you cannot even buy alcohol at Saturday 11:59PM
[10:13:03] <mazpe> or 23:59 lol
[10:13:25] <duch_kazatel> in Utah you can only buy 2 beers per visit to a restaurant/bar.
[10:13:26] <Uhkis> well you can only buy alcohol from 9 to 21 in finland (except for bars)
[10:13:32] <duch_kazatel> and the beer has to be a very low ABV.
[10:13:49] <duch_kazatel> mazpe that's not what a "dry state" is.
[10:13:54] <mazpe> Which is funny been such a republican state... isnt that a bit of COMMUNISM? telling the people why they can buy or not
[10:13:55] <Uhkis> Utah is one of those bible places too?
[10:14:15] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis no, utah has a lot of mormons.
[10:14:23] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: thats what a dry state is for the South.
[10:14:29] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: so yes? :D
[10:14:35] <mazpe> no sale of alcohol on Sunday.. you should be at church
[10:14:40] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis not technically apart of the bible belt.
[10:14:52] <duch_kazatel> mazpe "dry" means "no alcohol ever"
[10:15:25] <mazpe> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_state
[10:15:26] <duch_kazatel> the distillery that makes jack daniels is in a "dry county" - you cannot buy, sell, or consume alcohol in that county at all.
[10:15:29] <mazpe> I lived in Georgia.
[10:15:38] <Uhkis> US is such a weird place
[10:15:44] * mazpe nods
[10:15:47] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis so is europe ;)
[10:15:47] <mazpe> I love it...
[10:15:50] <mazpe> but weird
[10:16:05] <mazpe> the world is a weird place
[10:16:06] <duch_kazatel> mazpe i'd always heard "dry" to describe completely prohibited from having alcohol.
[10:16:19] <Uhkis> recreational weed in colorado, drive a bit and suddenly it's a felony
[10:16:26] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: nah, they vary in their definition..
[10:16:27] <duch_kazatel> and washington state
[10:16:34] <mazpe> even from county to county.
[10:16:47] <duch_kazatel> mazpe again - I'd always HEARD that.  i guess i was wrong.
[10:17:29] <Uhkis> i'd really love to do NY - LA road trip
[10:17:31] <mazpe> Its communism i tell you!
[10:17:39] <Uhkis> after this discussion, i'm not so sure ;D
[10:17:57] <mazpe> Uhkis: you'll be alright..
[10:17:59] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis depends on where you go.
[10:18:17] <mazpe> Plus.. you always have underground parties.
[10:18:32] <mazpe> In miami we have a few clubs that really never closes.
[10:19:20] <mazpe> on of my favorites: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0H1NlcCAH0
[10:19:47] <BillCriswell> There's a PDF in an embed element and I can't seem to save the fucker.
[10:20:06] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell ugh
[10:20:08] <Uhkis> why is it so bright in there :D
[10:20:34] <mazpe> Club space... opens Saturday at 10:00PM and closes Sunday when the crowd starts to live... I've been there many time from Satuday 11:00PM to Sunday 6pm
[10:20:35] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: firebug the url out?
[10:21:14] <BillCriswell> It's giving me some "PassportWizardMain.aspx" url. I'm getting the controls to save and print but it's not the PDF itself.
[10:21:32] <mazpe> Uhkis: because its the middle of Sunday morning :)
[10:22:16] <Uhkis> mazpe: well it's bright outside here 24/7 during summer but the clubs are still dark :D
[10:22:18] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that's weird.
[10:22:32] <BillCriswell> Government websites. =(
[10:22:51] <BillCriswell> I guess I'll have to type in all this shit by hand even thought it's in the PDF.
[10:22:52] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i know a guy who works for the state of california - it's worse than you think it is.
[10:23:33] <BillCriswell> I bet he makes good money at least.
[10:23:44] <BillCriswell> Thieves.
[10:23:47] <BillCriswell> I should stop.
[10:23:49] <BillCriswell> BRB!
[10:23:58] <duch_kazatel> he makes decent cash, great retirement, but terrible workplace in his case.
[10:24:23] <mazpe> Uhkis: that club has two levels in like 5 dance rooms... after 5AM, they open the terrace and everyone goes outside to enjoy Miamis weather :)
[10:24:43] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: how about printing it to pdf
[10:25:16] <Uhkis> mazpe: oh
[10:27:20] <mazpe> this http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ is there a way to display half hours? 1:00,1:30 i currently only se 1,2,3,4
[10:27:34] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I just get some annoying little page. They must just post the data right to that url in a weird way.
[10:27:57] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell probably webforms.  ASPX is... strange for stuff like that.,
[10:28:11] <duch_kazatel> mazpe ... really?
[10:28:30] <duch_kazatel> mazpe http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/#allowTimes
[10:28:31] <BillCriswell> About to get dirty with devtools.
[10:28:38] <BillCriswell> I feel like they're doing this shit on purpose.
[10:30:07] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: i guess i'm gonna have to spell it out
[10:30:23] <duch_kazatel> mazpe might be good to create a fiddle at this point.
[10:32:16] <mazpe> a fiddle?
[10:32:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:32:44] <duch_kazatel> it lets us run code and show you how to do things.  in this case, setting up the widget would be really helpful.
[10:32:51] <mazpe> duch_kazatel: ah yes! i saw that.. cool shit
[10:53:10] <mazpe> so am i missing something here? http://jsfiddle.net/nFGLM/
[10:53:32] <mazpe> maybe i didnt add the external resources right? lol
[10:54:21] <Uhkis> Error: The stylesheet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdan/datetimepicker/master/jquery.datetimepicker.css was not loaded because its MIME type, "text/plain", is not "text/css".
[10:54:34] <duch_kazatel> use this for github stuff: http://rawgit.com/
[10:54:47] <duch_kazatel> it's a content type header issue.
[10:56:37] <mazpe> i see!
[10:57:39] <hnkumar> guys!! how to fill multiple dropdown based on previous dropdown values? http://pastebin.com/tYJ2xfCL
[10:57:56] <hnkumar> when i'm using like that.. it is filling only 2nd one.  3rd and 4th is giving blank values
[10:58:32] <duch_kazatel> hnkumar what values can URL have?
[10:58:41] <duch_kazatel> don't show us PHP - show us what it renders.
[10:58:57] <hnkumar> it is simple like <option>xyz</option> like that
[10:59:02] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:59:07] <duch_kazatel> not was i asked for.
[10:59:10] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:59:27] <hnkumar> URL have one value of 2nd dropdown
[10:59:45] <hnkumar> 2nd dropdown have 1st selected value (it is working fine)
[10:59:55] <hnkumar> 3rd and 4th dropdown have 2nd selected value
[10:59:56] <duch_kazatel> your code doens't make much sense: http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:00:00] <duch_kazatel> setup a fiddle pls
[11:00:21] <hnkumar> fiddle???
[11:00:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net
[11:01:24] <duch_kazatel> your snippet doesn't make very much sense out of context.  setting the value of one dropdown based on another is pretty trivial.
[11:03:57] <hnkumar> duch_kazatel - it is working fine on while creating a record... but if i want to edit it then it is not loading when form loads
[11:04:20] <hnkumar> when form loads.. it is filling 1st (pretty simple) and 2nd is based on first value
[11:04:35] <hnkumar> but 3rd and 4th not working based on 2nd value while loading form
[11:04:43] <hnkumar> if it is empty form, everything is working fine
[11:04:49] <duch_kazatel> hnkumar not making any sense buddy.  i don't have any context.
[11:05:53] <duch_kazatel> let's do this: http://jsfiddle.net/259db/
[11:06:32] <duch_kazatel> you have 4 dropdowns, right?  on pageload, if dropdown 1 is set to a certain value, you need to then set dropdowns 2, 3, and 4 accordingly.
[11:06:39] <duch_kazatel> is that correct?
[11:07:08] <hnkumar> duch_kazatel - exactly
[11:07:31] <hnkumar> http://pastebin.com/4EAVRT1M - this new paste bin
[11:07:40] <duch_kazatel> please don't use pastebin btw.
[11:08:03] <hnkumar> ok
[11:08:14] <duch_kazatel> one moment.
[11:08:19] <hnkumar> sure duch_kazatel
[11:09:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/259db/1/
[11:10:09] <duch_kazatel> rinse and repeat for the other two dropdowns.
[11:10:21] <hnkumar> looking at code
[11:10:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/259db/2/
[11:11:00] <hnkumar> duch_kazatel - thanks, let me try this
[11:15:16] <hnkumar> with your code it is not even loading 2nd dropdown in my form :(
[11:15:21] <nitrospectide> Can anyone tell me why this wouldn't be working?
[11:15:34] <duch_kazatel> hnkumar "my code" illustrates the basics.
[11:15:39] <duch_kazatel> it's not a drop in solution.
[11:16:09] <hnkumar> i know... but i followed your solution.. if i keep it outside $function() then 2nd will load but not 3rd and 4th
[11:16:20] <hnkumar> if i keep it inside $function() then 2nd also will not load
[11:16:28] <duch_kazatel> then you have another problem.
[11:16:37] <duch_kazatel> do you understand what $(function(){}); is doing?
[11:17:25] <Ownix> How do I edit the data attributes so next time around my conditional statement will be different? http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/BdaGw/
[11:17:29] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know how to install grunt via GitHub - https://github.com/gruntjs?
[11:17:36] <Ownix> I always enter the true loop only.
[11:17:53] <Ownix> jeffreylevesque: http://gruntjs.com/getting-started
[11:18:20] <hnkumar> duch_kazatel - it will execute inside code while loading form (right)?
[11:18:27] <nitrospectide> erp. I meant.. why this wouldn't be working: http://pastebin.com/GAFGFn0v
[11:18:34] <jeffreylevesque> Ownix: I really want to install grunt via GitHub vs installing it in another way
[11:18:57] <duch_kazatel> hnkumar it waits until the document is ready.
[11:19:26] <duch_kazatel> Ownix $(this).data('favorited', true); is how you set data
[11:19:48] <hnkumar> do you think it may be jquery conflicts? (but in that page only jQuery 1.10 is loading)
[11:20:09] <duch_kazatel> hnkumar ... are you loading multiple versions on your site?
[11:20:42] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: right. I set the data, and then when favoriteSelectedFolder() the data in $(this) is still the same as if I had never set it
[11:20:54] <hnkumar> yup in another page where we have charts.. but this page doesnt have anything like that
[11:21:37] <duch_kazatel> Ownix right, becuse you're always hitting your "true" condition...
[11:22:04] <duch_kazatel> Ownix if (parentFavorited) { will always be true, because you set the data to "true" again.
[11:22:13] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: I was backwards in my thinking process http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/BdaGw/1/
[11:22:13] <Ownix> yes
[11:22:15] <Ownix> as you said
[11:22:19] <Ownix> thanks :)
[11:22:28] <duch_kazatel> np :)
[11:22:38] <duch_kazatel> hnkumar dunno dude.  without a fiddle it's hard to help.
[11:23:44] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide http://jsfiddle.net/kWCva/
[11:23:52] <duch_kazatel> start by preventing the default action of the click evemt.
[11:25:17] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: What if that link needs to trigger something else as well?
[11:25:46] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide then put all your logic in the same handler.
[11:25:56] <burnt> hey there, looking through some javascript / jquery a friend has written, and he uses this $([]).add when adding info to an array, im abit confused as no variable is used so how does jquery know what array to add it too? any help would be appricated
[11:26:27] <duch_kazatel> burnt do you have a more specific example?
[11:26:39] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: Hmmm. Then I'll have to hack an existing script. OK.
[11:26:43] <burnt> duch_kazatel sure ill pastebin it
[11:26:49] <duch_kazatel> please no pastebin :(
[11:26:53] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ burnt
[11:26:53] <b-ot> burnt: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:26:54] <burnt> ok jsbin
[11:26:55] <duch_kazatel> use one of tyhose.
[11:28:17] <burnt> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/MkBhh/
[11:28:37] <decx> wat
[11:28:57] <burnt> is it just adding them to an array to check the emails then not use them later?
[11:29:09] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[11:29:16] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: Is there some way to not merge the functions? Can I somehow catch the click event on an enclosing item, or otherwise use separate handlers?
[11:29:30] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide you can use event delegation instead.
[11:29:33] <burnt> im confused too
[11:29:38] <burnt> just wondered how it worked
[11:30:35] <duch_kazatel> burnt they're being cute.  totally unnecessary to do it this way.
[11:31:02] <burnt> what does it mean ? do? just add items to an array and then check them in a function then thats it?
[11:31:10] <burnt> meaning the array is destroyed after it is used?
[11:31:22] <duch_kazatel> really confusing syntax, too. basically they're declaring a bunch of vars within an add, adding those to a jquery collection, then adding an event listener.
[11:31:38] <burnt> ah ok
[11:31:39] <decx> wait this stuff actually does something?
[11:31:44] <duch_kazatel> it should yeah.
[11:31:53] <decx> just no
[11:31:58] <duch_kazatel> terrible idea.
[11:32:13] <burnt> so how could you referance them vars?
[11:32:22] <duch_kazatel> by using the names in the same scope.
[11:32:24] <hnkumar> duch_kazatel - solved problem by using setTimeOut
[11:32:29] <Whirl3d> I am having a complete break in sanity. Why doesn't: var msg="one,two, three"; var t=msg.split(",") work?
[11:32:52] <burnt> ah ok, so does using $([]).add mean add something to an unnamed array?
[11:33:11] <duch_kazatel> burnt err, kind of. they needed an object to add things tpo.
[11:33:16] <duch_kazatel> .add() is a jquery method.
[11:33:21] <duch_kazatel> they're adding to a collection.
[11:33:22] <decx> works just fine Whirl3d
[11:33:30] <burnt> ah I see
[11:33:30] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d works for me.
[11:33:39] <burnt> backwards syntax
[11:33:50] <duch_kazatel> not backwards, just dumb lol
[11:33:58] <burnt> almost impossible to read
[11:34:17] <Whirl3d> I have been trying to get jsfiddle to use it for hours. I'm gonna try jsbin, thanks doc
[11:34:31] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d i just got that to work in a fiddle.
[11:35:15] <burnt> thanks duch_kazatel for the help
[11:35:34] <duch_kazatel> I'd ask your friend why they're doing it that way, because that's really convoluted.
[11:36:25] <decx> no wonder add() is so slow if it can handle this mess
[11:36:48] <Whirl3d> okay, perhaps it's the textarea element messing things up. I am trying to parse an email message in the for .eml   I'll grab the fiddle.
[11:37:58] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/yPmL3/1/
[11:38:10] <burnt> duch_kazatel, pretty much thats what I just said to him in a sms
[11:38:32] <burnt> what would be the best way to do what he has done, do you have any links?
[11:38:41] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d bwuh?  are you trying to split on newlines?
[11:38:57] <Whirl3d> new lines and then :
[11:39:09] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d "\n" is a literal string.
[11:39:14] <Whirl3d> the newlines worked fine but the ":" says unrecognizable.
[11:39:25] <Whirl3d> is it /n?
[11:39:38] <duch_kazatel> hrm.  i wonder if OS matters or \n.
[11:39:40] <Whirl3d> weird cause \n was giving me line breaks
[11:39:40] <duch_kazatel> *for \n
[11:40:11] <duch_kazatel> anyway, you're trying to split on colons?
[11:40:12] <Whirl3d> I think in windows \n or \r represent the return or line feed keys
[11:40:23] <duch_kazatel> windows is \r\n for newline.
[11:40:31] <duch_kazatel> OSX is just \n
[11:40:44] <shoky> Whirl3d: you want p_lines[i] not p_lines[c]
[11:40:54] <Whirl3d> I want an object that looks like {to:someone@something.com, from:someone@something.com, subject:something, body:more somethings"
[11:41:02] <Whirl3d> forgot the }
[11:41:07] <duch_kazatel> shoky got it :)
[11:41:24] <Whirl3d> I am such a tard. Thanks shoky.
[11:41:59] <duch_kazatel> burnt just declare the vars and then add the binding to them.
[11:43:37] <duch_kazatel> though i'd give them all a class and just select that instea.d
[11:43:57] <greylurk> I'm working with a form in jquery Mobile, but when I hit "enter" or "go" when filling out a form field, it won't submit.
[11:44:22] <greylurk> Is there some flag that gets the form field to submit on enter/go?
[11:44:52] <greylurk> I hate to write a custom event handler just to do something that the browser does on its own without jqm
[11:45:02] <duch_kazatel> greylurk do you have a submit button?
[11:45:13] <greylurk> I've tried it with and without.
[11:45:54] <duch_kazatel> iirc, depending on the browser the enter key may or may not cause form submittion if there's only one text field OR when there's no submit button.
[11:48:05] <duch_kazatel> though, greylurk, i have to ask... when would a mobile user hit the "enter" key on mobile device?
[11:49:43] <greylurk> There's a "Go" button on all the Android keyboards I've ever seen when you're filling in form fields.  It always submits.
[11:49:49] <greylurk> Or at least the last one does.
[11:49:59] <duch_kazatel> and that works with this particular form?
[11:50:09] <greylurk> Not this form, but other forms on other web pages.
[11:50:26] <Whirl3d> uggg. I give up. There has got to be a way to process an email message into an object. Any suggestions?
[11:51:08] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: I'm trying the delegate, and I get an "Uncaught TypeError" Undefined is not a function" http://jsfiddle.net/kWCva/1/
[11:51:12] <greylurk> I'm not familiar with iPhones
[11:52:01] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide you still have to prevent the default action of the anchor.
[11:52:07] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'll go to a new page.
[11:52:28] <duch_kazatel> greylurk not sure then.
[11:52:42] <duch_kazatel> greylurk i'd end up double checking to make sure my form is valid.
[11:52:56] <Whirl3d> greylurk, did you try e.preventDefault() in your click handler?
[11:53:09] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d they don't want it to be prevented.
[11:53:26] <IceTrAiN> greylurk: you said it works on other sites.. go inspect their code :)
[11:53:35] <greylurk> Heh, they're not using jqMobile :)
[11:55:00] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d are you trying to split the message into key/value pairs?
[11:55:09] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel yes
[11:55:10] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/kWCva/5/
[11:55:24] <Whirl3d> greylurk, http://jsfiddle.net/kWCva/5/   sorry.
[11:56:18] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d so you'd have "recieved", "x-recieved", etc as keys?
[11:56:19] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, I have about 200 emails that I need to create a timeline for. When a bar on the timeline (representing an email) is clicked, a stylized preview needs to popup. I can't break down these emails into key-values
[11:56:51] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: The handler that already is attached to the a tag must be doing that, since it performs its existing function and does not nav to a new page. Are you saying the "Undefined is not a function" is due to this default not being prevented?
[11:56:58] <Whirl3d> to start. Then I can just use the pieces I want to make another object like {to:first address}
[11:57:13] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide i am not getting that error on the fiddle.
[11:57:21] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d one sec then.
[11:57:48] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, thanks for your help
[11:57:55] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: I am getting it in the Chrome inspector
[11:58:06] <duch_kazatel> nitrospectide weird.  i'm not seeing that error in the fiddle.
[11:59:45] <Whirl3d> It is odd to me that no one on the internet has ever needed a javascript that would convert html-based emails into objects...
[12:00:06] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d it probably exists, but it's relatively trivial to parse on your own.
[12:00:56] <duch_kazatel> shoot i have do go.
[12:01:00] <Whirl3d> That's what I thought...three days ago. LOL
[12:01:02] <duch_kazatel> i'll be back later.
[12:01:08] <Whirl3d> no problem. Thanks.
[12:01:26] <duch_lunch> http://jsfiddle.net/yPmL3/4/ here's where I got.
[12:01:28] <nitrospectide> duch_kazatel: I am still a neophyte, so I'm not sure why its throwing this: http://download.hexatrope.com/jserror.png
[12:08:49] <nitrospectide> Anyone still here?
[12:10:56] <Einzig> hello
[12:11:43] <Whirl3d> yep
[12:12:33] <Whirl3d> nitrospectide, can you verify that jquery is loaded before that line?
[12:13:58] <Einzig> I have a probably easy question, but just can't find the right answer via a search engine. Maybe helping me with keywords alreay helps :) I have a very long static menu on the left. When scrolling down 2/3 of the way of the middle section (that is linked to the left menu) I want to display the bottom half of the menu. Since each entry on the menu represents a rather large section on the middle content, I still want it to be fixed.
[12:16:19] <Einzig> Or in short, on a certain event I want to show the bottom half of a long static menu. The menu is now cut off at screen length. How to display the bottom half of a menu starting from the bottom of the screen, so that the top cuts off?
[12:16:54] <nitrospectide> Whirl3d: Yes. I just added a class directly to an element in the line prior
[12:19:03] <decx> Einzig move the top of the menu upwards step by step once you reach it's appropriate milestone on the right side
[12:19:12] <decx> its
[12:19:41] <decx> but to be honest it sounds like usability nightmare fuel
[12:19:48] <Einzig> :)
[12:20:50] <decx> or on scroll -> (scrollTop > body height / 2) move menu
[12:21:07] <Einzig> Well, the menu highlights the section I scroll over. Now going to the bottom of the page, the content neatly scrolls further, but you cannot see the highlights in the nav menu.
[12:21:43] <Einzig> hmm
[12:21:44] <decx> just don't use a fixed nav if you don't have the necessary screen height
[12:22:30] <decx> but if you already highlight the menu item you reached on the right then pushing the menu upwards shouldnt be a problem for you
[12:24:25] <Whirl3d> If you have the body divided into sections you can use the relative height of the "section" object to determine it's position on the screen.
[12:25:13] <Whirl3d> share your code in jsfiddle.net and we can probably help.
[12:31:11] <jeffmjack> is there a better way to replace content between element tags than replaceWith()?  I feel like all that html markup makes my code unnecessarily hard to read
[12:31:26] <nitrospectide> Whirl3d: So it seems this site is running  reeeeeeaaaally old jQuery. 1.3.2. Would this way of delegating work that far back?
[12:33:05] <decx> text() and html() jeffmjack only use replaceWith if you actually want to replace some tag
[12:51:18] <nitrospectide> Well, maybe I can come at this another way. When someone clicks that link, the classes on it are changed. Can I have the appearance of a certain class on the link trigger a class addition to a parent item?
[12:52:34] <ciqsteve> q: $(".score").each().bind("click", setScore);
[12:52:59] <ciqsteve> if I put a function(){ } in pplace of setScore it works.. .if I make setScore a function it doesn work.. dont understand why
[12:53:22] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: Not sure that .each() should be there.
[12:53:44] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: SHould also be using .on('click', setScore);
[12:53:45] <ciqsteve> even if there are multiple elements?
[12:53:52] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: Yes.
[12:54:27] <BillCriswell> Making setScore a function should be fine. Never ran into an issue there. I do see people do .on('click', someFunction()) which is normally wrong.
[12:54:49] <ciqsteve> BC - and .on implicitly sets the event on each element?
[12:54:55] <BillCriswell> just .on('click', someFunction); would be what you want... unless someFunction() returned a function but that's usually no the case.
[12:54:58] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: Yes.
[12:55:05] <ciqsteve> BC - tycvm
[12:55:07] <ciqsteve> tyvmn
[12:55:10] <ciqsteve> you get the idea
[12:55:10] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:56:50] <ciqsteve> BC- I put an attr on each element that IDs it uniquely.  Then I read that from the event context to figure out who trigged
[12:56:54] <ciqsteve> is there a better way to do that?
[12:57:38] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: You can just use `this`.
[12:59:15] <ciqsteve> but if score has a unique ID .. then I do this.. <div class="score" data-score-id="12345">0</div>
[12:59:40] <ciqsteve> in event -  this.attr('data-score-id')
[13:00:09] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: http://jsbin.com/fodatoce/1/edit?html,css,js,output is a pretty basic demo of this, using event delegation.
[13:00:17] <ciqsteve> k thanks
[13:00:20] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: this is just the element without jquery
[13:00:34] <BillCriswell> You would need to do $(this).data('score-id'); to get that.
[13:00:44] <BillCriswell> or $(this).attr('data-score-id')... but you probably want .data()
[13:03:26] <ciqsteve> $('.scores').on('click', '.score', handleScore);
[13:03:44] <ciqsteve> why connect the event to .scores?  is it simply to cut down on the attached events?
[13:03:55] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: Yes.
[13:04:02] <ciqsteve> Im learnin'
[13:06:19] <ciqsteve> thx for example
[13:06:29] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[13:11:24] <ciqsteve> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {...}
[13:11:40] <ciqsteve> does this affect the this or $(this) context in chrome dev tools?
[13:12:46] <ciqsteve> I get autocompletion on this and $(this) in the console
[13:12:47] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: No.
[13:12:53] <ciqsteve> but everything returns undefined is not a function
[13:13:20] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: Are you running noConflict?
[13:13:27] <ciqsteve> yes
[13:13:37] <ciqsteve> outside library said it was recommended
[13:14:14] <BillCriswell> Then $ is devtools.
[13:14:54] <ciqsteve> argh
[13:15:07] <ciqsteve> how do i get back in my local jquery context?
[13:15:51] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: You want to use jQuery in the console.?
[13:16:41] <ciqsteve> I use it on breaks to check out values and what elements get returned on various calls
[13:16:57] <ciqsteve> $(this).parentElement('.myelement')
[13:17:03] <ciqsteve> make sure its doing what I think
[13:17:27] <BillCriswell> Never tried to do that so not sure how it would work.
[13:18:14] <ciqsteve> have I been using devtool context the whole time?  that's funny
[13:18:21] <ciqsteve> figured the $(..) was jquery
[13:18:43] <BillCriswell> Try $.fn.jquery and see if it returns a number
[13:19:01] <ciqsteve> cant read fn of undefined
[13:19:20] <BillCriswell> jQuery() should always work if you want access to jQuery.
[13:19:30] <BillCriswell> jQuery.fn.jquery for example.
[13:19:35] <ciqsteve> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/tHsBq.js
[13:19:49] <ciqsteve> 1.11.0
[13:20:09] <ciqsteve> my breakpoint is on the e = event line
[13:20:29] <BillCriswell> Looking very global in there.
[13:21:56] <ciqsteve> this noconflict thing is screwing me up.. don't understand how its changing my context..
[13:22:08] <ciqsteve> rtfm i guess  :(
[13:22:46] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: noConflict gives $ back to what had it before it.
[13:23:01] <BillCriswell> If you don't run the noConflict it should work as you always used it?
[13:23:11] <ciqsteve> Im assuming so..  will go try
[13:25:32] <yosito> I'm trying to inspect the events on a given element, and the inspector is only showing me jQuery as the source of the events...
[13:25:57] <sdwrage> Hey all. Using JQuery Popup Window Plugin and am opening a popup window targeting an image and the window is the same size...the only issue is that the image sizes down and the user has to click on it to magnify it to full size... is there a way to get around this?
[13:26:09] <yosito> I read somewhere that you can use `$._data($0)` in the console to get an object that contains information about events.
[13:26:35] <yosito> But when I try to do `$._data($0)` all I get is `Object {}` without the ability to inspect it further.
[13:26:38] <yosito> Any ideas?
[13:36:59] <__joshua___> is $0 the the element you are interested in?
[13:37:39] <duch_kazatel> how has belgium not scored against us yet?!
[13:38:07] <duch_kazatel> yosito avoid using _data() if you can, since that's apart of the private api.
[13:46:34] <decx> apart or a part?
[13:47:34] <amb1s1> I have an issue, I would like to grab the value of a selected item from a dropdown menu. But I'm having issues
[13:47:45] <yosito> duch_kazatel: I'm just using it to inspect something to figure out what's going on, so I think that's ok.
[13:47:55] <amb1s1> here is my code
[13:47:56] <amb1s1> http://jsfiddle.net/DjvZ2/
[13:48:47] <yosito> amb1s1: In HTML you can't have the same ID on multiple elements, each ID must be unique.
[13:49:15] <amb1s1> ok
[13:49:30] <amb1s1> so how would I fix this even if I change the ID on each one
[13:49:36] <yosito> amb1s1: Gimme a second
[13:49:40] <amb1s1> ok
[13:49:41] <amb1s1> thanks
[13:51:18] <duch_kazatel> decx damn you.
[13:52:31] <ciqsteve> BillCriswell:  what I figured out was that the jQuery context wasn't getting passed to the function I connected to click
[13:55:48] <yosito> amb1s1: Take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/KARXL/
[13:56:53] <yosito> Does that make sense amb1s1?
[13:58:32] <decx> duch_kazatel don't blame me, blame english where apart and a part are one space apart and inflammable is flammable
[13:58:52] <duch_kazatel> decx i know.  i've been drinking today.
[13:59:02] <duch_kazatel> and don't care enough today
[13:59:20] <decx> at least you didn't write allready
[13:59:40] <duch_kazatel> i only get the meanings munged.
[14:00:51] <amb1s1> yosito: I got it
[14:00:52] <amb1s1> thanks
[14:00:59] <amb1s1> it make total sense
[14:01:42] <yosito> Cool. Good luck!
[14:09:16] <il> How can I make it so that my page doesn't load until all elements are finished loading, and during the loading time, a loading image is displayed, exactly like "Initiating the Awesome" with jsfiddle? Is there an app for this?
[14:09:30] <duch_kazatel> lol "an app"
[14:09:56] <duch_kazatel> put all your stuff in an element that's hidden on pageload, and make a div that you show instead.
[14:10:19] <duch_kazatel> then on document ready hide the loading and show the hidden.
[14:12:04] <duch_kazatel> or window load.]
[14:13:52] <il> duch_kazatel, thanks. How can I get a fade effect?

[14:43:57] <paulvd> ?
[14:44:07] <paulvd> i am trying to remember the name of the plugin
[14:44:11] <duch_kazatel> mind trying to describe it again?

[14:47:29] <duch_kazatel> tomatto probably not.
[14:47:39] <duch_kazatel> paulvd looks like that's all handwritten.
[14:48:14] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: that is bad
[14:48:19] <paulvd> i foind it
[14:48:21] <paulvd> found
[14:48:30] <duch_kazatel> what was it, paul_k?
[14:48:42] <duch_kazatel> err, paulvd
[14:48:46] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ tomatto
[14:48:49] <b-ot> tomatto: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:49:11] <duch_kazatel> tomatto it's hard to understand what you want.
[14:49:35] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, how can I approach this differently (with respect to an email-object)? http://jsfiddle.net/yPmL3/7/
[14:50:11] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d first off you don't want to split on newlines.
[14:50:13] <duch_kazatel> split on :
[14:50:33] <duch_kazatel> iterate through and craft your object from there.
[14:51:03] <Whirl3d> BUt there are : in times
[14:51:12] <Whirl3d> so it gets terribly ugly
[14:51:19] <duch_kazatel> and there are newlines in items.
[14:51:21] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[14:51:29] <Whirl3d> Why is e-mail such a mess?
[14:51:44] <Whirl3d> rhetoric
[14:51:44] <duch_kazatel> because it's OOOOLD
[14:51:51] <Whirl3d> true there

[14:58:35] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: jsfiddle has not support for jquery ui?
[15:00:10] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, I think I'll use regexp to parse it myself. I never trust code that contains for loops with alert in them. lol I'll check back, thanks.
[15:00:30] <duch_kazatel> tomatto it does actually.
[15:01:05] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: i want to populate slider, but it doesn't
[15:01:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/2G39g/1/
[15:01:21] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui
[15:03:45] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: i tried older 1.11 version of jquery
[15:03:58] <duch_kazatel> tomatto 1.11 is actually newer than 2.0.2
[15:03:59] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[15:04:08] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/2G39g/2/
[15:04:32] <duch_kazatel> it's an issue with the compatibility of jquery and jquery ui versions.
[15:07:08] <Whirl3d> perhaps I should start with a list of possible smtp fields
[15:07:20] <duch_kazatel> that's an idea.
[15:07:59] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: i want something like this http://jsfiddle.net/2G39g/4/
[15:09:39] <duch_kazatel> tomatto yeah, you can't do it that way.
[15:09:45] <duch_kazatel> tomatto that's not a valid object.
[15:10:04] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: so how can i do it?
[15:10:44] <duch_kazatel> tomatto let me show you.
[15:10:46] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[15:12:01] <duch_kazatel> tomatto why do you have two document readies in there?
[15:12:47] <duch_kazatel> tomatto either way, it'd look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/2G39g/5/
[15:13:12] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: which two document...?
[15:13:42] <duch_kazatel> tomatto $(function() { is a document ready
[15:13:46] <duch_kazatel> you have that twice in your code.
[15:13:48] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:14:28] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: i copied that from jqueryui.com example for show you my point
[15:19:49] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: thanks for that :)
[15:24:35] <duch_kazatel> tomatto jqueryui wouldn't have 2 document readies in an example.
[15:25:47] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: i know, i forgot about that jsfiddle's direct one
[15:27:51] <duch_kazatel> huh? the fiddle I gave you didn't have one in it.
[15:56:35] <ISmithers> How do I set a function callback to a selection list option, so that when I select say, option 3, I can access that data?
[15:56:54] <ISmithers> I can seem to get callbacks from the main list, which lets me access the children option objects, but it feels like there is a better way.
[15:57:46] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers .val() is the current value of option three.
[15:57:59] <duch_kazatel> what other data are you loking for?
[15:58:01] <Edvard> hi, if:   this  relates to an li,  how do i select the nested <a> element
[15:58:13] <Edvard> eg: $(this a)
[15:58:45] <duch_kazatel> Edvard a few ways - $(this).find('a'); is one
[15:58:47] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel I want to know which option is set. So in a list of 12 things ,if I choose one, the callback function can access which one is chosen so that I know.
[15:59:22] <Edvard> the previous line was
[15:59:41] <Edvard>  $('#topten').delegate('li a', 'click', function() {
[15:59:53] <Edvard> i mean:
[16:00:01] <Edvard>  $('#topten').delegate('li', 'click', function() {
[16:00:12] <Edvard> but i changed it to :
[16:00:14] <Edvard>  $('#topten li').delegate('a', 'click', function() {
[16:00:21] <Edvard> is that another way ?
[16:00:28] <duch_kazatel> Edvard not the same thing.
[16:00:33] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using/
[16:00:51] <Edvard> 2.1.1
[16:00:53] <Edvard> and
[16:00:54] <duch_kazatel> $('#topten').on('click', 'li a', function() {
[16:00:58] <Edvard> mobile-1.4.2
[16:00:58] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[16:01:05] <duch_kazatel> don't use .delegate any more.
[16:01:14] <Edvard> thanks
[16:01:25] <Edvard> why not use any more?
[16:01:43] <duch_kazatel> it's deprecated in favor of .on()
[16:01:50] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers http://jsfiddle.net/yxwzv/
[16:02:07] <Edvard> cool thanks
[16:02:07] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers are you trying to access other data on the option?
[16:02:16] <Edvard> alot has changed since i last tried to learn jquery
[16:03:04] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers if you need specifics about the option that was clicked, you'll need to listen to clicks on the options: http://jsfiddle.net/yxwzv/1/
[16:03:04] <Edvard> i cant figure out how to get the attr
[16:03:07] <Edvard> $('#topten').on('click', 'li a', function() {
[16:03:07] <Edvard>   currentItem = $(this).attr('data-id');
[16:03:18] <duch_kazatel> Edvard you don't want the attribute for data.
[16:03:24] <duch_kazatel> use .data('id') in that case.
[16:03:35] <Edvard> i have an attr called
[16:03:38] <Edvard> data-id
[16:03:41] <Edvard> and data-shop
[16:03:45] <duch_kazatel> Edvard right, use .data() for those instea.d
[16:03:47] <duch_kazatel> not .attr()
[16:03:52] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel That triggers a function when  I make a selection, which is what I have. But how do I know which object is selected?
[16:03:55] <Edvard> let me try this
[16:04:13] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers through a convoluted process.
[16:04:32] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers you'd have to find the option with that value.
[16:04:48] <duch_kazatel> unless you change your binding to the click event of the options instead.
[16:05:23] <Edvard> $(this).data('data-id');
[16:05:32] <duch_kazatel> Edvard no.  .data('id')
[16:05:36] <Edvard> arr i thought so
[16:05:37] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel So far I can only find click events which tell me that 'a' option was clicked, but out of the dozens of options, nothing seems to tell me which specific one was clicked.
[16:05:40] <Edvard> but wasnt sure
[16:05:48] <Edvard> thanx
[16:06:05] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers can you share your code?
[16:06:11] <ISmithers> Weird, this seems like something which should be far easier than it actually is.
[16:06:23] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers i feel like i'm not understanding your queston.
[16:06:25] <duch_kazatel> *question
[16:07:10] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel I have a selection list. It has 20+ items in it. When I select an item, I want to know which one was selected.
[16:07:34] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel At the moment, everything I have tried, just tells me that 'something' was selected. But not what it was, how do I know that the user has selected item #12?
[16:07:48] <ISmithers> Or #3, or #28 etc etc.
[16:07:52] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers if you bind to the select's change event, you will only ever be able to get info about that select and not the option that was selected.
[16:08:12] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel So I need to bind to the option instead it sounds like?
[16:08:54] <duch_kazatel> did you see my example from before?
[16:09:02] <Edvard> if my console outputs: [object Object]
[16:09:13] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel I have both examples open, the first or second?
[16:09:14] <Edvard> how can i access the objects
[16:09:17] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers you want http://jsfiddle.net/yxwzv/1/
[16:09:24] <duch_kazatel> Edvard what are you outputting?
[16:09:34] <Edvard> trying to output a string
[16:09:44] <ISmithers> Yes that is the second one.
[16:09:46] <Edvard> let me check, ive had do undo everything twice today
[16:09:55] <duch_kazatel> Edvard sounds like you're trying to coerce a complex object to a string.
[16:10:18] <Edvard> shopId
[16:10:23] <Edvard> should be a number
[16:10:23] <duch_kazatel> Edvard not helping.
[16:10:24] <Edvard> lol
[16:10:38] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers the second one in that fiddle is what you want, though I'd consider just creating an object whose keys are the values in the select.
[16:10:42] <Edvard> sorry am trying to cut out all the shit to make this easier
[16:10:47] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel That example doesn't seem to trigger the second callback. Only the first that is bound to the select object. The one bound to the option click, doesn't do anything.
[16:11:07] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers i'm seeing them both work.
[16:11:16] <ISmithers> Hmm
[16:11:21] <ISmithers> Browser?
[16:11:28] <duch_kazatel> ah i see it now.
[16:12:03] <duch_kazatel> chrome doesn't respect that it looks like.
[16:12:08] <ISmithers> In Maxthon and Chrome I only see one callback.
[16:12:14] <duch_kazatel> i see two in ff.
[16:12:16] <duch_kazatel> odd.
[16:12:24] <duch_kazatel> looks like you'll have to go with the object.
[16:12:43] <ISmithers> OK it works in FF.
[16:13:23] <duch_kazatel> yeah, so you'
[16:13:32] <duch_kazatel> *you'll be stuck with some other mechanism here.
[16:14:14] <ISmithers> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15971698/select-option-onclick-function-works-in-ff-but-not-in-chrome
[16:14:17] <ISmithers> Just fyi
[16:14:28] <Edvard> is .attr still used for setting attributes?
[16:14:30] <duch_kazatel> you could also do something like $(this).find(':selected') in your change handler.
[16:14:36] <duch_kazatel> Edvard not usually.
[16:14:38] <duch_kazatel> Edvard you want .prop()
[16:14:39] <Edvard> jesus
[16:15:03] <Edvard> another to the list of things to change
[16:15:04] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers this is why I was suggesting the data object route.
[16:15:19] <duch_kazatel> Edvard these were all a long time coming... how long ago did you try learning?
[16:15:50] <ISmithers> What is the data object route duch_kazatel?
[16:16:15] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers i explained it earlier - have an object whose keys are the values to your options.
[16:17:14] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel I don't understand what that means. Don't worry, I'll figure it out, thanks for the help though.
[16:17:22] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you.
[16:19:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/X2877/
[16:19:21] <duch_kazatel> simple
[16:19:52] <duch_kazatel> see how the property names in theObject match the values in the select dropdown?
[16:20:23] <ISmithers> That is simple.
[16:20:33] <duch_kazatel> this way you're not storing tons of data on nodes.
[16:20:36] <ISmithers> That seems like the best route really.
[16:20:40] <ISmithers> Yeah I understand.
[16:21:36] <ISmithers> Thanks for the help duch_kazatel :>
[16:21:40] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:21:40] <ISmithers> Much appreciated.
[16:27:45] <Edvard> bloody charger ran out
[16:27:48] <Edvard> battery
[16:27:54] <Edvard> about 12months ago
[16:27:59] <Edvard> maybe 11
[16:28:08] <duch_kazatel> Edvard these changes have been in the pipe for years.
[16:29:11] <Edvard> i recently have started an app i put on the shelf
[16:29:26] <Edvard> this is my new start : http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/83/
[16:29:29] <duch_kazatel> .prop() instead of .attr(), etc.
[16:30:19] <Edvard> is that the only adjustment you would make?
[16:30:52] <duch_kazatel> oh you wanted feedbvack?
[16:30:58] <Edvard> ya pls
[16:31:16] <Edvard> i need to learn, since what i learnt is pretty dated
[16:31:16] <duch_kazatel> uh, let me take a quick poke i guess.
[16:31:38] <duch_kazatel> btw - http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/102/
[16:31:49] <duch_kazatel> don't need to include jquery modal separately.
[16:31:53] <duch_kazatel> there's a checkbox for it.
[16:32:29] <Edvard> no need for js or css externals ?
[16:32:47] <Edvard> good stuff
[16:33:01] <duch_kazatel> Edvard not if you check the box.
[16:33:10] <Edvard> checked now
[16:33:41] <duch_kazatel> Edvard right - i did that for you ;)
[16:33:47] <Edvard> true
[16:33:51] <Edvard> but am copying in my window
[16:33:55] <duch_kazatel> so first, don't do carId = $(this).attr('data-car');, do carId = $(this).data('car');
[16:34:00] <Edvard> learn by repeating tasks i do
[16:34:38] <Edvard> this sounds powerful
[16:34:40] <duch_kazatel> $.each(cars, function(i, car) { don't do this wtwice.
[16:35:02] <duch_kazatel> and there's no need to use jquery for that.
[16:35:21] <Edvard> js?
[16:35:40] <duch_kazatel> just raw javascript for object.
[16:36:44] <ISmithers> Hey duch_kazatel, what is that object called? the: var = {} It looks like a dictionary, but I'm not finding much information on how to build it up dynamically.
[16:36:46] <Edvard> so far: http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/105/
[16:36:55] <ISmithers> Is it just a js 'object'?
[16:36:59] <duch_kazatel> Edvard one sec.
[16:37:04] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers that's an object.
[16:37:08] <duch_kazatel> no dictionaries.
[16:37:25] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers if you want dynamic key names, check out the square bracket syntax.
[16:37:54] <ISmithers> Yeah so myObject.myValue = '' or myObject['one'] = '' essentially.
[16:38:22] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers that first one will create the property "myValue"
[16:38:44] <duch_kazatel>  myObject[myValue] will use whatever string myValue returns as the property name.
[16:38:56] <ISmithers> Yeah I am familiar with the syntax, just wasn't sure what javascript called it.
[16:39:04] <duch_kazatel> Edvard http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/106/
[16:39:26] <duch_kazatel> Edvard that might not function correctly, but you get the idea
[16:39:44] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers yeah, in js we have Objects.  Arrays are objects, too.  but we don't have hashes or associative arrays.
[16:40:36] <Edvard> arr i needed a for
[16:40:44] <Edvard> i thought i needed a foreach or each
[16:40:47] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:41:03] <duch_kazatel> well, actually, you could use forEach() there instead.
[16:41:06] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[16:41:20] <duch_kazatel> but forEach() doesn't exist in IE8 and below.
[16:41:32] <Edvard> arrr
[16:41:46] <Edvard> the All Cars page works as expected
[16:42:34] <duch_kazatel> you see the other change I made btw?  i got rid of the multiple enumerators.
[16:42:37] <duch_kazatel> you only need to do one.
[16:42:40] <Edvard> can you see how i am getting the data on click: line 45
[16:42:48] <Edvard> emumerators?
[16:42:56] <Edvard> i removed the sort by as it was screwed
[16:42:59] <duch_kazatel> you had two $.each()
[16:43:03] <duch_kazatel> you only need one.
[16:43:12] <Edvard> i thought i deleted 1 lol
[16:43:15] <Edvard> shit
[16:43:24] <duch_kazatel> what onclick?
[16:43:34] <duch_kazatel> $("#car_list, #topten_list").on("click", "a", function(event) { this one?
[16:43:38] <Edvard> yeah
[16:43:50] <duch_kazatel> wha3t about it?
[16:44:05] <Edvard> the lines below
[16:44:15] <duch_kazatel> what about them?
[16:44:41] <Edvard> should it be something like: $('#car').on('pagebeforeshow', function() {
[16:45:09] <Edvard> i noticed i no longer have these in my page
[16:45:09] <duch_kazatel> Edvard no.
[16:45:10] <duch_kazatel> never.
[16:45:25] <duch_kazatel> don't bind handlers in other handlers.
[16:45:27] <Edvard> so a listener for a is correct?
[16:45:39] <duch_kazatel> i don't know what you';re asking
[16:45:57] <Edvard> when a user clicks a link from a list
[16:46:02] <Edvard> it goes to #car
[16:46:14] <Edvard> it needs to fetch the id, name, etc..
[16:46:31] <Edvard> i was using: $("#car_list, #topten_list").on("click", "a", function(event) {
[16:46:31] <duch_kazatel> what you've got works - not sure if there's a different "jquery mobile" way.
[16:46:38] <Edvard> is that upto date?
[16:46:56] <Edvard> or is there a more pro way to do this
[16:46:57] <duch_kazatel> why are you using delegation there?
[16:47:19] <Edvard> i used it once on the topten page, it was left over from my project
[16:47:41] <Edvard> i cant remember, thanks for helping me realise not to use it
[16:47:52] <ZP18> Hi
[16:47:54] <duch_kazatel> it's not a "do or don't" - genuine question.
[16:48:22] <ZP18> is there a scrollend or scroll stop event?
[16:48:42] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 nope.  do you need velocity info on scroll?
[16:48:58] <Edvard> i believe it was using to to attach an ID to each link, so it knows which data to load
[16:49:23] <ZP18> I want to do a function when the page is scrolled but then do another when it is finished
[16:49:37] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: please, is possible to have variable step on range from min to max for slider?
[16:51:06] <ZP18> duch_kazatel: say I want an element to fade in when the page is scrolled but when at the top of the page it disappears
[16:52:47] <duch_kazatel> tomatto wat
[16:53:29] <ZP18> how do you make it scroll to a certian part of the page?
[16:53:35] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 tons of ways.
[16:53:39] <duch_kazatel> animate scrollTop()
[16:53:54] <duch_kazatel> if you don't care about a smooth animation, use an href.
[16:54:05] <ZP18> sorry I’m not experienced in jquery only just started yesterday
[16:54:16] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery scrolltop
[16:54:17] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .scrollTop() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/

[16:54:40] <duch_kazatel> tomatto have a fiddle?
[16:54:46] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 look at those pages.
[16:54:52] <ZP18> thnx duch_kazatel I’ll check it out
[16:55:41] <Edvard> ok i think i fixed this first part
[16:55:48] <Edvard> http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/111/ , any feedback pls
[16:57:53] <duch_kazatel> Edvard you're appenbding the same thing twice.
[16:57:54] <duch_kazatel> why?
[16:58:10] <Edvard> line?
[16:58:14] <tomatto> duch_kazatel: i have step 25 now http://jsfiddle.net/2G39g/6/ , but i want to have step 25 from 0 to 200 and to 500 step 50
[16:58:24] <Edvard> yeah
[16:58:28] <duch_kazatel> Edvard 36 and 37
[16:58:28] <Edvard> i am actually
[16:58:43] <Edvard> but the second is meant to only display a few items
[16:59:04] <Edvard> topten is static
[16:59:09] <Edvard> the other will be filtered
[16:59:31] <Edvard> in real time
[16:59:42] <Edvard> should i just use one list?
[16:59:45] <duch_kazatel> one sec let me show you the problem.
[16:59:47] <duch_kazatel> slow down yo.
[17:00:11] <Edvard> i have brain probs
[17:01:45] <ZP18> duch_kazatel: I managed to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/fJ7at/      but I want it to be slower
[17:02:20] <ZP18> duch_kazatel: dw Imma try work out myself
[17:02:50] <duch_kazatel> wat
[17:03:56] <duch_kazatel> Edvard this might not work, but http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/113/
[17:04:00] <duch_kazatel> something like this.
[17:04:05] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 did you write all of this?
[17:04:18] <ZP18> yeh
[17:04:31] <duch_kazatel> check out the docs for fadeTo() again.
[17:04:37] <ZP18> ok
[17:04:44] <duch_kazatel> there are two argsd.
[17:04:51] <ZP18> to be honest I never looked into the docs
[17:05:10] <duch_kazatel> then how did you know that fadeTo() can take two args?
[17:05:16] <duch_kazatel> or did you copy/paste from google?
[17:05:48] <ZP18> no
[17:05:54] <ZP18> I just tried things
[17:05:59] <duch_kazatel> uh-huh.
[17:06:08] <ZP18> and I read and studied other peoples code
[17:06:13] <Edvard> thanks
[17:06:18] <Edvard> trying to understand it now
[17:06:20] <duch_kazatel> Edvard the basic idea make sense?
[17:06:27] <duch_kazatel> ZP18 check out the docs.  super simple stuff.
[17:06:35] <ZP18> ok
[17:06:56] <Edvard> let me try to explain what i think it means
[17:07:00] <Edvard> should be a laugh
[17:07:08] <Edvard> to reduce repetition
[17:07:11] <Edvard> of course
[17:07:15] <duch_kazatel> right
[17:07:17] <Edvard> is why
[17:07:20] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[17:07:25] <duch_kazatel> no need to create the same thing twice.
[17:07:33] <duch_kazatel> create once, edit it, pop it in.
[17:07:39] <duch_kazatel> there are cleaner ways to do it, but i'm lazy
[17:07:56] <Edvard> oh god
[17:08:37] <Edvard> all cars page now showed me 1 result, shit
[17:09:32] <duch_kazatel> you're a very intense dude
[17:11:02] <Edvard> lol, maybe am taken wrong, my mind is intense but am sitting with my feet up and a big doobie
[17:12:03] <Edvard> i cant understand why all cars now displays:  1 item
[17:12:18] <duch_kazatel> probably because my code isn't right.
[17:12:36] <duch_kazatel> try cloning that node into a new objec and editing that/appending that instead.
[17:20:08] <Whirl3d> doesn't obj.html() return the htmlstring of the juery object obj? What if its not appended to the dom, does it still work?
[17:20:52] <duch_kazatel> "the dom" is a funny thing.
[17:20:59] <duch_kazatel> it could be a fragment.
[17:21:04] <duch_kazatel> which doens't show up in the main window.
[17:21:11] <duch_kazatel> but it still exists.
[17:23:40] <Edvard> just fiddling away
[17:23:56] <Whirl3d> here is the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/yPmL3/56/
[17:24:38] <Whirl3d> I need to add the "colspan=3" property to the "eml_subject" and "eml_body" fields and thought I could do it in my toValue() parser.
[17:26:31] <Whirl3d> ugg. nvm. got it another way
[17:26:57] <duch_kazatel> fwiw i wouldn't have a function named toValue() return HTML.
[17:27:24] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I hate most of the function names. Just did it in a rush
[17:28:42] <Whirl3d> besides, I'll write this as an extension so you can $(emailArray).parseImap(); next.
[17:32:06] <duch_kazatel> imap?
[17:32:08] <Whirl3d> how do you check if something is a jquery object in js?
[17:32:23] <duch_kazatel> oh for emails.
[17:32:27] <Whirl3d> I have a js library for imap for gmail.
[17:32:49] <duch_kazatel> and you could see if it's got jquery in the prototype chain, though you should know if you have one or not.
[17:33:31] <Whirl3d> I want to be able to pass a string or jquery object to the function $.parseImap(targ,props) {
[17:33:56] <systemfault> Whirl3d: if ('jquery' in myPerhapsjQueryObject) could probably do it.
[17:34:01] <Whirl3d> where targ could be a jquery object or could be a string. I think I can just use targ=$(targ) and be fine, though
[17:34:09] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d i wouldn't do that imo.
[17:34:33] <duch_kazatel> instanceof would work though
[17:34:45] <Whirl3d> $($(".something)) doesn't resolve to $(".something") does it?
[17:35:16] <duch_kazatel> not the exact same thing, no, but basically the same.  i'd just expect one kind of input.
[17:35:28] <ISmithers> I may be attempting to do this the wrong way, but I populate my selection list via php by echoing the html code. However I am not sure how to populate my javascript data object with the same keys.
[17:35:42] <ISmithers> I don't know them ahead of time, so they must be dynamically created as the HTML side is.
[17:35:44] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers by generating js the saem way.
[17:36:40] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, that kind of violates the whole jquery way of doing things, doesn't it. I mean you can select items using a number of ways, not just one.
[17:37:06] <duch_kazatel> err, you're convoluting concepts.
[17:37:13] <ISmithers> duch_kazatel I tried: echo "<script>jsFunctionToAddData($php_key)</script>"; but it gives me an unhandled exception for the php_key.
[17:37:34] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers php and js don't communicate with one another.
[17:37:49] <duch_kazatel> Whirl3d you should know if a function is going to accept one thing or another.  no need to accept strings OR jquery objects.
[17:38:11] <duch_kazatel> that's apart of the contract of the function - give me a valid object, I'll give you what you want.
[17:38:30] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers you actually have to print out the js like you would html.
[17:38:41] <ISmithers> Which is my sticking point duch_kazatel, I am not sure how to ensure my js has the same key as the php creates.
[17:38:43] <duch_kazatel> there might be a lib that outputs JSON, too.
[17:38:56] <duch_kazatel> i dunno - i don't use PHP
[17:39:19] <ISmithers> echo "<script>jsFunctionToAddData(" . $php_key . ")</script>"; then?
[17:39:35] <duch_kazatel> isaacdurazo maybe?  i don't know anything about php.
[17:39:41] <duch_kazatel> err, ISmithers
[17:39:53] <ISmithers> That would print out the js wouldn't it?
[17:39:59] <duch_kazatel> i have no idea.
[17:40:02] <duch_kazatel> i don't know PHP.
[17:40:19] <ISmithers> OK
[17:41:27] <duch_kazatel> but that js wouldn't make sense.
[17:44:06] <duch_kazatel> just print out the object.
[17:45:52] <Whirl3d> duch_kazatel, then why doesn't jquery follow your same logic?
[17:45:59] <duch_kazatel> clarify.
[17:46:36] <Whirl3d> $(something) can be a jquery object, a string, and object, etc. Using your logic, $(something) should always be only one type
[17:46:41] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:46:50] <duch_kazatel> that's where you're convoluting things :)
[17:47:02] <duch_kazatel> $() is a constructor that returns a jquery object.
[17:47:03] <Whirl3d> I have no doubt. That's my specialty.
[17:47:17] <Whirl3d> based on multiple input types
[17:47:59] <duch_kazatel> you can pass it a string that's formatted as markup, or a string that's a selector.
[17:48:22] <Whirl3d> $.convertImap=function (sel, props) {    "sel" can be anything you can pass to $()
[17:48:39] <Whirl3d> or a jquery object
[17:49:56] <duch_kazatel> i rarely see people accomodate that much.
[17:49:58] <Whirl3d> or an array of any of those things
[17:50:12] <Whirl3d> $(["a","p"]) works as well
[17:50:17] <duch_kazatel> that's ugly.
[17:50:27] <duch_kazatel> but functions, yes.
[17:50:38] <Whirl3d> that's not my decision, jquery created that, I'm trying to pass it on
[17:50:48] <duch_kazatel> mmk broseph.
[17:51:02] <duch_kazatel> it's okay to disagree :)
[17:51:15] <Whirl3d> I don't think it's appropriate to extend jquery with a function that is not jquery-compatible.
[17:51:47] <duch_kazatel> i think you're confused about what I'm saying.  i also think 9/10 it's not appropriate ot extend jquery, period.
[17:52:04] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I leave.
[17:52:04] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[17:52:07] <Whirl3d> lol. Probably true onboth accounts
[17:52:18] <Whirl3d> thanks fo ryour help an dinput.
[17:52:30] <Whirl3d> hope I didn't sound disrespectful, wasn't my intention
[17:54:49] <Whirl3d> I wish there was a way to point responses to lines. For example, when duch_kazatel said I was convoluting things, I replied "that's my specialty" but he had already typed something by that time.
[18:02:00] <ZP18> hi

[20:14:59] <pawelbx_> hi, does anyone know why jquery's .width() always returns a rounded integer value. the doc says it can return a fractional value, but i've never seen it. the problem is that if i don't have fractional precision then i get a width that is sometimes off by 1 pixel
[20:36:41] <Whirl3d> pawelbx, you can't have a fractional pixel
[20:44:37] <jayar> can i change the way toggle() works?
[20:48:40] <amb1s1> i don't know if my question should be here or jquery
[20:49:18] <amb1s1> but request.is_ajax() came back false
[20:50:07] <amb1s1> here is my view
[20:50:08] <amb1s1> http://dpaste.com/3VXMGT1
[20:51:03] <amb1s1> jquery
[20:51:05] <amb1s1> http://dpaste.com/3GFQRF0
[20:51:59] <systemfault> The X-Request-With header should be sent… try to print them on the server (python I guess)
[20:52:19] <systemfault> Err X-Requested-With I meant
[21:09:35] <amb1s1> systemfault: still getting false
[21:10:09] <systemfault> amb1s1: Do you get the X-Requested-With header on the server?
[21:11:47] <systemfault> If yes… then something's wrong with your server-side.
[21:12:26] <amb1s1> how do I check that
[21:13:12] <amb1s1> here is the error that I get
[21:13:14] <amb1s1> [02/Jul/2014 04:08:48] "POST /%7B%%20url%20%22add_member_dash%22%20%%7D HTTP/1.1" 404
[21:13:54] <systemfault> amb1s1: Should be clear….
[21:14:07] <systemfault> Your server side is not rendering your template properly.
[21:14:33] <systemfault> So it's trying to send the data to: {% url "add_member_dash" %}  instead of the actual URL
[21:15:15] <systemfault> You understand? {% url "add_member_dash" %} should be substituted with /adasdas/dasdasjdkaksjd
[21:15:31] <amb1s1> can I just send "/add_mamber_dash"
[21:15:59] <amb1s1> instead of {% url "add_member_dash %}
[21:16:03] <systemfault> amb1s1: Learn how your template engine works.
[21:16:24] <systemfault> amb1s1: It's a python issue at this point :?
[21:16:26] <systemfault> :/
[21:20:20] <amb1s1> ok, I'm getting this now
[21:20:22] <amb1s1> [02/Jul/2014 04:19:43] "POST /add_member_dash HTTP/1.1" 403
[21:20:33] <amb1s1> I guess this has to do with csrf_token
[21:20:58] <systemfault> Probably
[21:21:07] <systemfault> 403 means "Forbidden"
[21:53:30] <TTomiK> Morning... Anyone familiar with Bootstrap's typeahead? How can I access element's REL-attribute from typeahead's updater ?
[21:57:06] <TTomiK> from console.log(this) the rel-attribute's value can be found from $element / context / attributes / 4 (probably the wrong way to express the tree), but how can I access it?
[22:01:05] <VectorX> hi, how can i get top html to look like the bottom basically getting the div[.description] span[.text-item] data-text and putting it in the <span> http://jsfiddle.net/8KD5u/1/
[22:05:42] <VectorX> ok got it
[22:12:02] <vexati0n> i have a jquery function that works, but i can't always rely on the backend to return a response in a reasonable amount of time. how can i tell jquery "if it takes longer than 30 seconds give up and allow the user to do something else" ?
[22:27:58] <TTomiK> anyone... how to dig "this" values deeper? Need to find $element / context / attributes
[23:49:18] <shmoon> I'm looking for a really good plugin that can help me have sticky headers and columns in a table?
