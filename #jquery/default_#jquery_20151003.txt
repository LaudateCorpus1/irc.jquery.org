[03:40:25] <lordjancso> hi all
[03:41:19] <lordjancso> is there any easy way to draw squares in spiral form?
[03:43:59] <lordjancso> something like this
[03:43:59] <lordjancso> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JYWOoz
[03:44:04] <lordjancso> but all square must be a div
[03:44:21] <lordjancso> in fixed order in dom
[04:18:53] <robhol> heh, oh boy.
[04:43:14] <naftilos76> Hi, i am trying to figure out ways to optimize the process of fetching thousands of rows from the database and still get a completely rendered page in less than 2-3 seconds. This has got to be done by converting the instance that has the database rows in a raw json data object passed to a js var in my js view and then build a table with js/jquery. This is my approach so far but the thing is that i do not want to keep all that data fetched in a table
[04:43:14] <naftilos76>  but instead keep it in a js var and selectively copy paste to the actual visible table to the user. Do you have any suggestions regarding ways to further optimize this procedure?
[05:00:55] <gnarf> naftilos76: maybe look at something like datatables ?
[05:01:01] <gnarf> it probably does most of that work for you
[05:02:10] <lordjancso> hi i have a div: <div data-text="line1\nline2">click</div>
[05:02:26] <naftilos76> gnarf, i did have a look but not for long, you see in my case i complicated things a little bit more. Thanks anyway
[05:02:39] <lordjancso> when i click on this div, i cant to console.log data-text with \n to <br>
[05:03:06] <gnarf> naftilos76 not really - you just have a custom adapter / ajax query for your data
[05:03:08] <lordjancso> i'm using this function: http://phpjs.org/functions/nl2br/
[05:03:11] <lordjancso> but it doesnt work
[05:03:19] <gnarf> in the end you have rows in a table with pagination
[05:03:34] <gnarf> and datatables does a lot of that
[05:03:44] <gnarf> working with tables has got to be a special level of hell
[05:04:04] <gnarf> I >highly< suggest you get one of the many table/grid plugins
[05:04:50] <naftilos76> gnarf, it is when you are dealing with ajax calls being triggered by doubleclicking on every single cell
[05:05:04] <naftilos76> thanks
[05:05:33] <gnarf> naftilos76: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ -- I'd still use datatables - they have event handlers for things like double click on row
[05:06:51] <naftilos76> gnarf i have already built a version of what i want, it is just that i need some extra optimizations push
[05:08:51] <gnarf> naftilos76: look at the code for datatables - it's open -- there are probably some things in there that will make a lot of sense in your context
[05:09:16] <naftilos76> gnarf, i will thanks
[05:09:25] <gnarf> if you want some help optimizing - it might be worth posting a gist of your code
[05:09:26] <gnarf> or jsfiddle
[05:09:31] <gnarf> with some "mock data"
[05:09:39] <gnarf> i wont be around to help
[05:09:47] <gnarf> but someone would probably help review it
[05:09:57] <gnarf> gnight all
[05:31:50] <lordjancso> is possible to iterate table cells in this way? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BoWmYd
[05:46:26] <A1234A> lordjancso:http://codepen.io/anon/pen/rOyYdP
[05:47:24] <lordjancso> A1234A every field have a number, i meant in that order :)
[05:51:30] <A1234A> you mean spiral order?
[05:54:32] <eikood> 5
[06:12:01] <lordjancso> A1234A yes, i mean spiral order
[06:12:19] <lordjancso> A1234A do you have any idea how to achieve this?
[06:14:23] <A1234A> i can do it in c. but don't know in jquery. you may look at this. then you can get an idea. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/
[06:16:22] <lordjancso> A1234A thank you i will take a look
[06:17:27] <A1234A> is the table cells and row size are fixed lordjancso
[06:17:51] <lordjancso> yeah its a 7x7 matric
[06:17:55] <lordjancso> matrix
[06:18:19] <A1234A> always??
[06:19:30] <lordjancso> yes
[06:19:44] <lordjancso> its a board game's table
[06:20:10] <lordjancso> but this code snippet is looking good
[06:20:11] <lordjancso> i can use this
[06:26:52] <A1234A> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PPpOxK lordjancso
[06:26:57] <A1234A> check it out
[06:27:06] <A1234A> i can modify a bit
[06:28:52] <lordjancso> A1234A yeah thats looks ok. but what if i have to create a table and cells in this order? :)
[06:31:22] <A1234A> put id to the cells as per the spiral value. Then you can easily assign necessary values to it.
[06:32:49] <lordjancso> hmm yeah that will be good
[06:32:51] <lordjancso> thank you!
[07:49:44] <A1234A> has anyone used jplist?

[08:25:18] <Smace> Hello. I am after a minimalistic version of jquery with ONLY "ajax HTTP client". Does it exist already?
[08:26:56] <Smace> I want to have "jQuery.ajax()" isolated from the whole of jQuery.
[08:27:53] <Uhkis> just copypaste that section from the source
[08:30:46] <Smace> Which is the file? And doesn't it have dependencies?
[09:04:52] <Kartagis> https://paste.debian.net/314276/ what's wrong with filename?
[09:09:46] <A1234A> can you give us a sample filename from public://
[09:11:22] <Kartagis> 1443877867536.jpg
[09:12:53] <Kartagis> A1234A: ^
[09:14:46] <Uhkis> js cant access php streams like that
[09:15:30] <A1234A> you are using date.now() which gives time in ms. does the file exist in public:// ??
[09:28:28] <A1234A> Kartagis: ?
[09:29:47] <Kartagis> A1234A: oh, I am trying to upload a file with phonegap, and trying to determine its name
[09:40:04] <Pazician> Hello all. I'm trying to make an slider plugin, but I don't what I've done wrong... https://jsfiddle.net/p7c013bv/
[11:11:28] <Kartagis> what am I doing wrong on line #13 on http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/5t1Lxuns/1/ ?
[11:24:21] <shoky_> Kartagis: you're doing $.each  on a string, that takes it apart into characters and loops over them
[11:40:10] <Kartagis> shoky_: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/5t1Lxuns/2/ can you help me find out how many times field_kime includes 764?
[11:48:04] <shoky_> Kartagis:  http://jsfiddle.net/5t1Lxuns/3/
[11:49:07] <shoky_> Kartagis: and if you don't like the .reduce it's just as simple with a .forEach  http://jsfiddle.net/5t1Lxuns/4/
[12:13:28] <Kartagis> shoky_: thank you btw
[12:24:25] <robhol> .reduce <3
[13:07:36] <BostonGeorge2k> how do i debug js properly
[13:07:47] <BostonGeorge2k> i cant figure out which scripts is in charge of the preloader my page uses
[13:08:19] <hapi> BostonGeorge2k: use breakpoints
[13:08:42] <hapi> BostonGeorge2k: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 this might be useful
[13:08:42] <BostonGeorge2k> i am not sure where to place them
[13:10:46] <BostonGeorge2k> how do i set a breakpoint if i have no clue wich part of the script is in charge..?
[13:11:31] <hapi> search in the script words like "loading" "load" "loaded" etc
[13:11:55] <hapi> but if you not sure about that will be useful:)P
[13:12:21] <BostonGeorge2k> well tehre will be 100+ occurences
[13:16:22] <robhol> Any jquery plugins for interactive directed graph-like things?
[13:16:49] <hapi> http://canvasjs.com/jquery-charts/
[13:17:15] <hapi> but if you google a little deeper you find nice ones with well documented api
[13:17:40] <robhol> preferably with different kinds of "edges" that can be annotated
[13:34:19] <FearDread> greetings earthlings
[13:47:12] <iaj> when I want to put an a href to an element, like $('.foo')  whats the most common/best way to do so?
[13:50:09] <robhol> what do you mean, link to an element?
[13:52:44] <iaj> well have it wrapped with <a href="www.google.de">.foo</a>
[14:12:46] <robhol> take a look at the dom insertion stuff in api.jquery.com, there's a func to surround a DOM element with whatever you want, but I don't remember the name
[14:42:16] <iaj> robhol: I figured that .wrap works :)
[15:16:28] <robhol> that's it, yeah. :3
[15:28:48] <Bonfi96> Hi, could someone take a look at this? https://jsfiddle.net/c5ykyvfL/ it's a very very simple script but apparently I can't figure out what's wrong
[15:48:18] <noahmg123> is there a quick way to grab every element with a certain css property? (e.g. (a little fun example) search for elements with "display: none", put them in an array, and (the purpose) make them all "display: block" (or something like that))
[15:53:30] <silverdust> I need help with this http://jsfiddle.net/fpcxoejf/
[15:53:57] <silverdust> Why isn't it fading out the closest in the loop. Works without a loop
[16:24:38] <lineinthesand> Is there a default theme in jquery-mobile-<version>.css?
[17:53:12] <shoky_> silverdust: don't use for loops. i's scope is global, because javascript.  so when the click happens and the handler is called, the for loop is already long finished, and i is 4
[17:53:16] <shoky_> no matter which one you click
[17:54:18] <shoky_> silverdust: but you shouldn't be using .closest('.step-'+i)  anyway.  classes shouldn't be used like that.  just use a class "step"
[17:54:58] <shoky_> guess i'm kinda late answering that
[17:55:58] <shoky_> anyways http://jsfiddle.net/fpcxoejf/3/
[18:09:41] <LindsayMac> Alright I finally have a working case up with data and everything!! and shoky_ is still here!
[18:10:38] <shoky_> well i just got here.. but yes ;)
[18:10:46] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  well welcome back  :)
[18:10:53] <shoky_> thx ;p
[18:11:00] <LindsayMac> So if anyone wants to take a look.. HERE is my use case. http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/L5w3n5Lj/68/
[18:12:04] <LindsayMac> I have an autocomplete script (jquery UI one) and a "duplicate" script. The problem is that even though I'm am attempting to rebind the autocomplete to the input field (right now on.focus but i've tried other methods too) I can not get any newly created form fields to trigger the auto complete http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/L5w3n5Lj/68/
[18:13:23] <shoky_> what am i supposed to do?  and what's supposed to happen?
[18:14:04] <shoky_> and why doing all this stuff on focus
[18:15:20] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  sorry...
[18:15:38] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  so type into the first field and you will see the names pop up. Select a name and it populates both fields
[18:15:56] <shoky_> LindsayMac: it seems you are re-initializing the autocomplete widget on each focus... without destroying first.. bad
[18:15:59] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  if you click the + button to add another field group, if you start typing the autocomplete does not pop up
[18:16:05] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  Ahhhh DESTROY!
[18:16:23] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  the focus event was just to test to make 100% sure it was being re-bound to that input_
[18:16:31] <shoky_> oks..
[18:16:31] <LindsayMac> but I didnt destroy it .. i feel like that is 100% the issue
[18:16:45] <shoky_> why destroy and re-initialize, anyway
[18:16:59] <shoky_> just relaxing seems more efficient
[18:19:19] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  well, the fields are not in the DOM until after they're addedmanually on click.
[18:20:06] <shoky_> so?
[18:20:52] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  so if they aren't in the DOM until after the page loads, don't have I have bind some how each time a new field set is added?
[18:21:06] <shoky_> initialize them right after adding them to the DOM
[18:21:10] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  right now it's just on focus but initially i had it happening when the + was clicked. This was just me desperately reaching
[18:21:23] <shoky_> but also, don't clone stuff with jquery-ui widgets on them
[18:21:30] <shoky_> just create a new input
[18:21:37] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  how do you mean?
[18:21:51] <shoky_> var newinput = $('<input class="nonUsersInput firstname" ...>');
[18:22:15] <shoky_> currently you're cloning the inputs  when clicking +
[18:22:31] <shoky_> and that's bad to do for stuff with initialized widgets on them
[18:23:44] <LindsayMac> Ok... so I am going to have to look up the best way to create a NEW element in the DOM using a variable that contains the markup for that element
[18:25:22] <shoky_> or just clone a copy before initializing the first autocomplete
[18:25:30] <shoky_> and later you can clone this clean copy
[18:26:28] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  would append be even easier?
[18:26:52] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  the settings are basically the same for all so I can make a "template" <input> with variables in the name / id ,etc and just append it
[18:28:43] <shoky_> cloning a copy before the first initializing is probably the easiest right now
[18:28:45] <LindsayMac> shoky_: can you explain deeper how to "destroy" after the loop is finished for adding a new item? I dont want to .remove() .. does JS something like die() ?
[18:28:58] <shoky_> LindsayMac  .autocomplete('destroy')  on the input
[18:29:12] <shoky_> but hang on.. fixing up your fiddle
[18:29:13] <LindsayMac> Ahh ok
[18:34:43] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  k
[18:41:02] <shoky_> LindsayMac:  http://jsfiddle.net/L5w3n5Lj/71/
[18:41:50] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  awesome.. gonna read your code now
[18:42:30] <shoky_> LindsayMac: cool, and mm change that .clone(true) to just .clone()   not that it matters much
[18:43:50] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  this seems to create a LOT of <ul>s every time you add a new one and then populate it with the results (i think) but never removes it
[18:45:06] <LindsayMac> Ok.. i'm going to have to play with this a bit... but its def. a step in the right direction
[18:45:10] <shoky_> LindsayMac:  huh no idea what you're talking about
[18:45:18] <shoky_> it's not adding any <ul>
[18:45:56] <shoky_> it's just adding an <li>
[18:46:34] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  watch http://cl.ly/1U0B182E3d2N
[18:46:48] <LindsayMac> it is.. after the <table> it is
[18:47:37] <shoky_> LindsayMac: oh that's just the autocomplete's lists.  they will be there in your fiddle too if you focus on the inputs
[18:48:06] <shoky_> LindsayMac: and in my fiddle when you remove a row (click the -)  it will destroy the instance and remove those <ul>'s
[18:48:12] <shoky_> they're hidden, in any case
[18:48:31] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  hmmm ok. I didn't notice that in my example where it was creating one every time
[18:48:44] <LindsayMac> I was pretty sure it replaced them
[18:48:51] <shoky_> LindsayMac:  look at your example before focusing. then focus both inputs and you'll see 2 new ul's
[18:49:02] <shoky_> LindsayMac: your fiddle doesn't work beyond that so no more are added :)
[18:49:08] <LindsayMac> Ah ok..
[18:49:18] <LindsayMac> ew. I dont like that (*not your doing but jQuery UI)
[18:49:38] <shoky_> it's fine. how else would you want it
[18:49:44] <LindsayMac> I mean, once you select your option that <ul> should go away... there's no use for it since nothing else is being searched
[18:49:54] <shoky_> if it's not visible, why does it matter?
[18:50:06] <shoky_> if it would go away then it would take longer each time to re-create it
[18:50:07] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  mostly just to clean up the DOM
[18:50:12] <shoky_> you want it to stay snappy, i imagine
[18:50:17] <LindsayMac> yea true
[18:50:21] <shoky_> no reason to clean up the DOM
[18:50:28] <shoky_> DOM is not for humans ;)
[18:50:34] <LindsayMac> yea
[18:51:00] <LindsayMac> So the only thing I have to really look at with yours is the incrementation of the ID's / Names
[18:51:21] <shoky_> i didn't change how that works
[18:51:24] <LindsayMac> because it's using the cloned first one to make a copy from which is always 1
[18:51:26] <shoky_> should be same i think
[18:51:30] <shoky_> ah right
[18:51:33] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  i know, but it was adding 1 to the last added input
[18:51:41] <LindsayMac> the "last added" is always going to be your first clone
[18:51:42] <shoky_> yeah so you'l need to update that a bit
[18:52:14] <shoky_> im gonna clean some dishes ;s
[18:52:32] <LindsayMac> ok thanks for the help.. got me moving in a new, better direction
