[00:10:11] <Tingle> I got a weird Chrome bug, the elements that I am adding through .eq().append() are disapearing like 1 sec after they are added. I see it for a second and then they are gone again. this only happens in Chrome
[00:12:38] <Tingle> nvm I remember why, onAfterDynamicContentLoaded is called twice or after a strange point unlike the other browsers
[01:04:22] <Hilton> I have a series of <div> elements which have a click handler to make them act like links. I can't use <a> because on narrow screens they transform into a different display and no longer act as links. How can I make the href (data-href) show up in the status bar (or the little popup in Firefox) like a normal link does?
[01:22:27] <shoky> Hilton you can probably use <a> and just need to style it correctly
[02:11:41] <html5> hey
[03:41:43] <ashwinkumar> clear
[03:48:34] <afidegnum> hi all, anyone online ?
[03:50:25] <afidegnum> hi, what's the best way to create a drag and drop image to make it a new image/object?
[04:25:28] <Parsi> i'm appending an <input> element to a div on the fly, like this <input type="text">FOO
[04:25:48] <Parsi> then I want to remove that element and also followin foo
[04:25:52] <Parsi> how can i do this?
[04:27:14] <Crucials|2> you could probably stick the "FOO" bit in a <p> or similar, and remove that
[04:27:35] <Parsi> there are sevreal <input type="text">FOO
[04:27:59] <Parsi> i'm using .each() to find the input
[04:28:18] <Crucials|2> <div class="removeNext"><input type="text">FOO</div>
[04:28:25] <Crucials|2> and just remove the div?
[04:28:27] <Parsi> then i can use .next() to remove the following foo?
[04:29:05] <Parsi> actually it's: <div class="removeNext"><input type="text">FOO<input type="text">FOO<input type="text">FOO</div>
[04:29:27] <Parsi> and i want to remove one of <input type="text">FOO
[04:29:50] <Crucials|2> What I meant is that you could wrap each individual input and FOO with a seperate div
[04:30:00] <Parsi> hm
[04:30:07] <Parsi> good idea
[04:30:15] <Parsi> let me try it
[04:32:06] <kneekoo> hello! :)
[04:32:17] <kneekoo> all well so far, but I have a hairy situation here
[04:32:37] <kneekoo> I want to retrieve the percentage width, not the px value
[04:32:40] <Parsi> Crucials|2: thanks for idea
[04:32:44] <Parsi> that works
[04:32:55] <Crucials|2> awesome
[04:33:02] <Parsi> another problem
[04:33:09] <Parsi> actually it's not a problem
[04:33:24] <kneekoo> because the percentage has a very precise value: style="width: 86.9722557298%"
[04:33:27] <Parsi> as I described, i have several input controls
[04:33:37] <Parsi> when i remove one of them
[04:33:47] <Parsi> others align automatically
[04:33:51] <kneekoo> should I simply parse the text?
[04:34:01] <Parsi> can i add some animation to them?
[04:34:24] <Parsi> assume you have 10 <input> and you remove one of them
[04:35:42] <Parsi> controls followed those are next to the just disappeared one, instantly stick to the left
[04:36:02] <Parsi> *controls those are next to the just disappeared one, instantly stick to the left
[04:44:41] <kneekoo> so, is there an easy way to get the width value exactly like inside this declaration? style="width: 86.9722557298%"
[04:45:07] <kneekoo> because $("#div").css("width") returns the value in px
[04:54:57] <Crucials|2> you still there Parsi?
[04:55:37] <Parsi> yes Cr
[04:55:39] <Parsi> Crucials|2:
[04:55:49] <Crucials|2> you could do something with css transition
[04:55:52] <Crucials|2> like this
[04:55:59] <Crucials|2> http://jsfiddle.net/GxMK5/1/
[04:56:10] <Crucials|2> someone probably wants to re-write the remove() bit, but you get the idea
[04:56:25] <Parsi> thanks Crucials|2
[04:56:37] <Parsi> that's like what I want
[05:07:48] <rved> i've googled this before im asking, so here goes: im using masonry to create boxes (floating, with different heights) all boxes are the same width. Responive, so in % ... but the documentation of masonry doesn't show (good) examples of this http://masonry.desandro.com/options.html
[05:07:58] <rved> i have not set columnWidth
[05:08:06] <rved> and my css defines widths for the boxes
[05:08:29] <rved> but masonry doesn't fill the container correctly, it shows 3 out of 4 boxes on 1 line
[05:08:37] <rved> and the 4th is missing
[05:10:47] <Crucials|2> you're trying to stick 4 boxes in a container, but 1 of them is missing?
[05:30:38] <kneekoo> <div class="progress" style="width: 87.0325693607%"></div>
[05:31:02] <kneekoo> can I get that exact width value without using regex?
[05:31:22] <kneekoo> I already got it with regex but if there's an easier way I'd go with that
[05:31:51] <kneekoo> css("width") return the value in px, so I can't use it
[05:31:56] <kneekoo> returns*
[05:33:38] <kneekoo> Crucials|2: any idea?
[05:34:29] <Crucials|2> can you get the value in px, the parent value in px, and do some mathematics?
[05:34:50] <kneekoo> I can, but the precision is not good enough
[05:34:58] <kneekoo> that percentage is overkill
[05:35:02] <rved> Help! Masonry responsive issue: http://nl.tinypic.com/view.php?pic=15o9yq8&s=8#.Uwind_R5O04
[05:35:30] <rved> http://paste2.org/CLM5AEAp
[05:35:53] <rved> does any one have a clue?
[05:36:16] <rved> http://masonry.desandro.com/options.html
[05:37:44] <Crucials|2> kneekoo: http://jsfiddle.net/dHtag/
[05:41:02] <kneekoo> very nice :)
[05:41:09] <kneekoo> thanks, Crucials|2
[05:41:19] <Crucials|2> np
[05:41:22] <kneekoo> I further removed the "%" like this: $('.progress').attr('style').replace('width: ','').replace('%','')
[05:41:30] <kneekoo> and there it is :)
[05:41:46] <decx> what's the plan here?
[05:41:48] <Crucials|2> wrap it all up in a parseInt() if you wanna use it
[05:42:01] <decx> why are you replacing styles with attr?
[05:42:28] <Crucials|2> just reading them, decx
[05:42:45] <decx> you can read .css('width')
[05:43:08] <Crucials|2> he wants the original % that he put there
[05:43:09] <Crucials|2> somehow
[05:43:35] <decx> ah
[05:44:19] <Crucials|2> dunno if there is a better way to get that
[05:44:38] <decx> yes
[05:44:40] <decx> $('.progress')[0].style.width
[05:45:14] <decx> note that this only works on inline styles
[05:45:32] <decx> but shouldnt be aproblem in this case
[05:45:45] <kneekoo> wow, even shorter
[05:46:00] <kneekoo> I still have to replace "%" but it looks great :)
[05:46:06] <kneekoo> thanks, decx
[05:46:13] <decx> np
[05:46:57] <Crucials|2> ah thats fancy
[05:47:17] <Crucials|2> the other method also limited you in what other inline styles you could use
[05:47:20] <Crucials|2> (none)
[05:47:30] <decx> hehe
[05:48:05] <kneekoo> true, but for this specific case it's just that piece of html :)
[05:48:25] <kneekoo> I had no idea you can take such shortcuts :P
[05:48:57] <kneekoo> what does [0] stand for?
[05:50:20] <decx> style.width is native javascript
[05:50:29] <decx> $('.progress') is a jquery object
[05:50:30] <Crucials|2> blasphemy
[05:50:49] <decx> $('.progress')[0] is the first "native" javascript object inside that jquery object
[05:51:22] <kneekoo> oh... so that's why it didn't look like regular jQuery
[05:52:01] <decx> yes, style.width just grabs this elements style property
[05:52:16] <kneekoo> sweet :)
[05:52:27] <kneekoo> jQuery devs are awesome :))
[05:52:45] <decx> na i'm shit, but i can help beginners ;)
[05:53:07] <kneekoo> thanks for the compliment
[05:53:21] <kneekoo> if you're shit... I can't tell what I am =))
[05:53:33] <Crucials|2> lol
[05:53:37] <decx> hey everyone starts somewhere, good for you for wanting to learn
[05:53:59] <decx> learning never stops
[05:54:06] <kneekoo> well, I learning by playing with live data
[05:54:45] <kneekoo> I'm writing a *monkey script to automate some tasks on a website
[05:55:14] <kneekoo> I read values, make decisions based on certain conditions and so on :)
[05:55:15] <decx> not having to learn with just imaginary scenarios helps imho
[05:55:28] <decx> i learn the most when i have an idea but don't know how to realize it
[05:55:35] <kneekoo> I just love this way of learning because I can actually see how it works
[08:27:43] <decx> yeah you have to rewrite it as a real event
[08:27:43] <decx> it's just a function as is
[08:27:43] <iceptic1> hi guys http://pastebin.com/8iCBeyde how do i do a repsonse to a div named message?
[11:02:21] * giustoXricordarv la campanella piu veloce della storia
[11:05:20] <simpleuser_> Hi there. To change a value according to the button I clicked, I use this code : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9160179 . But now, for same event, I want to change the value of a field. What should I write? This doesn't seem to work : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9160199
[11:05:46] <simpleuser_> With this last code, my Modal doesn't even show
[11:56:15] <mdev> I have a <img src="catchpa"> and that calls a php script that outputs a catchpa image header and all how can i reset the catchpa without reloading the page with via jquery
[11:56:41] <mdev> I know ajax but I can't replace the html....it'll just replace <img src= I think
[11:56:48] <mdev> not actually redownload/recall the image
[11:59:07] <decx> no need for ajax, just append a random number to your image src
[11:59:35] <decx> <img src="captcha" becomes <img src="captcha?+Math.random()
[11:59:37] <mdev> how would that refresh the catchpa on the page without a reload?
[11:59:49] <mdev> would it recall it then ?
[12:00:10] <decx> circumvents the cache because it'S technically a new image
[12:00:40] <mdev> interesting, i'll try and do that thanks
[12:05:26] <mdev> very cool
[12:05:33] <mdev> thank you sir, you're clever
[12:07:31] <mdev> I did a jquery ajax get on the catchpa php page and reset the img src= to exactly what it was when the data returned, that makes the browser update the image for some reason
[12:08:00] <mdev> also because the catchpa which is catchpa.php without an extension, doesn't a have a image extension browsers don't seem to cache it which is neat
[12:08:10] <mdev> but i'll add the random number thing just for good measure
[13:07:15] <clime> hey, if you have got datepicker jquery object, can you somehow get the date picker object itself (the model)?
[13:07:47] <clime> that is from $('.ui-dialog')  get the datepicker object
[13:09:51] <clime> or can you at datepicker init assign custom data attribute (that would point to the input to which datepicker is attached - from that I can get the datepicker object easily)
[13:17:54] <lukey_> Hi is there a reason why swatches would suddenly stop working in query-mobile?
[13:18:53] <shoky> clime:  .data('datepicker')
[13:20:48] <lukey_> i.e. the "data-theme" attribute suddenly has no effect and all my controls are unthemed...
[13:21:38] <clime> shoky: that would be nice but data are empty for the datepicker element (tried $('.ui-datepicker).data())
[13:22:25] <shoky> clime: you want .data on the input, not the datepicker element
[13:22:52] <clime> shoky: ye well, I want to go from the datepicker elem to the instance
[13:22:59] <shoky> oh
[13:23:05] <shoky> mm, why?
[13:25:34] <clime> shoky: i want to automatically reposition .ui-datepicker elems on resize, orientationchange, so they stay aligned with the input element on mobile platforms when zooming on form occurs.
[13:26:12] <clime> they are being misaligned inside margin: auto containers
[13:26:45] <shoky> there is only one ui-datepicker element though
[13:26:54] <shoky> even if you have multiple inputs with datepickers
[13:29:17] <clime> shoky: oh ok then I want reposition that one element if it exists
[13:29:19] <shoky> you can hook to beforeShow or something and store the input in some var
[13:29:34] <clime> shoky: alright, ill try to do it, thx!
[13:30:30] <clime> shoky: or well, i'll assign a special class to the input that says that datepicker is attached to it.
[13:31:01] <clime> shoky: oh ok, there is already hasDatepicker:)
[13:31:15] <clime> so the way from inputs will be easier in the end
[13:31:16] <shoky> yeah but that doesn't tell you which of the inputs was last clicked
[13:31:29] <shoky> they all have the same hasDatepicker class
[13:31:46] <clime> can I ask if their datepicker isOpen()
[13:32:18] <alexut> if i append a div with jquery, is it fesable to try to remove it with :lastchild selector ?
[13:32:53] <clime> shoky: $("#filter_date").datepicker( "widget" ).is(":visible")  should be possible
[13:34:34] <shoky> clime: no that doesn't help, cause they all have the same widget
[13:34:49] <shoky> so if its visible for input A, it's visible
[13:34:50] <clime> shoky: oh, just realized that
[13:35:06] <shoky> why not just store the last used input in a var
[13:35:43] <shoky> o nm you wanna know if its open
[13:37:21] <clime> shoky: ye but also to which input it belongs atm
[13:37:33] <shoky> hah
[13:37:35] <shoky> $.datepicker._lastInput
[13:37:40] <clime> nice
[13:38:14] <shoky> and  $.datepicker._curInst
[13:38:32] <shoky> $.datepicker._datepickerShowing
[13:38:41] <clime> shoky: exactly what I needed:)
[13:38:58] <clime> thx!
[13:39:16] <shoky> ;]
[13:41:26] <snollux> How can I access and change the value of an input element? Why doesn't $("#element").value = "new"; work?
[13:42:28] <FaceHunter> Hello i have a bit of a problem here
[13:43:16] <shoky> `api val @ snollux
[13:43:27] <shoky> snollux:  .val('new')
[13:44:02] <drnick_naeluh> well your nick name is FaceHunter haha
[13:44:31] <FaceHunter> drnick_naeluh: how does that relate to anything at all?
[13:44:48] <drnick_naeluh> I am joking that a funny nickname
[13:44:49] <shoky> must relate to something
[13:45:16] <FaceHunter> says the guy with drnick naeluh
[13:45:25] <FaceHunter> anyway
[13:45:28] <drnick_naeluh> yeah I know haha
[13:45:47] <FaceHunter> i have some table rows with class 'user' and an id
[13:46:07] <drnick_naeluh> $("#element").val('newvalue');
[13:46:11] <FaceHunter> when i try to get them using selector $(".user#<id>")
[13:46:22] <FaceHunter> it works for all id's except for 1
[13:46:27] <FaceHunter> id '1'
[13:47:29] <FaceHunter> http://qs.lc/zrajw
[13:47:35] <FaceHunter> you can clearly see both exist
[13:47:47] <FaceHunter> but it just doesn't take .user#1
[13:48:11] <shoky> FaceHunter do you have another element with id="1"
[13:48:18] <FaceHunter> yes
[13:48:22] <shoky> then that's your problem
[13:48:23] <FaceHunter> but not with class user
[13:48:24] <shoky> id's must be unique
[13:48:28] <shoky> doesn't matter
[13:48:32] <shoky> ids must be unique, period
[13:48:39] <FaceHunter> let me see then
[13:48:46] <FaceHunter> (as i have another id 2
[13:48:47] <FaceHunter> )
[13:48:51] <FaceHunter> (which works)
[13:48:51] <shoky> don't use such ids
[13:49:22] <FaceHunter> well it's kinda dynamic
[13:49:25] <shoky> $('#id') will get you the first one probably
[13:49:33] <FaceHunter> and using blah_<id> is a bit meh
[13:49:48] <shoky> then use  class="blah"  data-id="1"
[13:50:06] <shoky> or if you want to keep using ids  then yes, use blah_<id>
[13:50:38] <shoky> in any case, ids must be unique ;p
[13:50:43] <FaceHunter> seems to work right now
[13:51:00] <FaceHunter> don't get why it only breaks at 1 and not at 2
[13:51:07] <FaceHunter> guess because 2 was display:none;
[13:51:11] <shoky> nah
[13:51:20] <shoky> probably the other #2  is after this one
[13:51:25] <shoky> but the other #1 is before this one
[13:51:35] <shoky> $('#id') should get the first one, i think
[13:51:47] <shoky> (whehter you also add a .class selector or not)
[13:52:42] <FaceHunter> well it returned none
[13:52:51] <shoky> because you filtered it with the class
[13:52:53] <emartin> does anyone here drink soup straight out of the can
[13:52:59] <FaceHunter> emartin: no
[13:53:04] <emartin> it's.... fresh....
[13:53:09] * emartin drinks it slowly
[13:53:17] <FaceHunter> who drink soup out of a can anyway
[13:53:19] <FaceHunter> i mean
[13:53:22] <FaceHunter> you have to heat it
[13:53:30] <FaceHunter> one does not heat a can
[13:53:40] <emartin> I just drink it cold
[13:53:52] <shoky> you savage savage
[13:54:04] <emartin> sir, I am a gentleman and a scholar
[13:54:16] <emartin> WHILE YOU ARE JUST INTERNET PPLZ
[13:54:22] <FaceHunter> ehm
[13:54:25] <shoky> eurmie
[13:54:39] <FaceHunter> a "gentleman" doesn't drink straight out of it either
[13:54:50] <emartin> I am... revealed :(
[13:54:52] <FaceHunter> guess you meant i'm a male
[13:54:59] <shoky> ok i think we can wrap this up
[13:55:17] <FaceHunter> why can't i connect with hexchat
[13:55:18] <FaceHunter> =(
[13:55:21] <emartin> <fin>
[13:56:34] <FaceHunter> anyway thanks for the help
[13:56:37] <FaceHunter> i'm out
[13:56:41] <FaceHunter> i hate qchat
[14:02:04] <rigel> so i'm using vertical tabs, but i have quite a lot of them. and when i click a new one that's lower on the screen the content changes but then i have to scroll back up.
[14:02:19] <rigel> i would prefer not to use frames, but is there another way around this?
[14:02:50] <rigel> i'd like to keep the tabs i'm on in view, and have the content box spring out from there, so that i can easily go to the next tab
[14:03:10] <rigel> or just auto-position the content the tabs open
[14:03:47] <rigel> i suppose i could switch to accordion but i dont like the look of that quite as much

[14:14:41] <DevePy_> why wen return ajax, my function init not load
[14:15:20] <systemfault> Thorn: You decided that .ready worked for iframes?
[14:15:48] <Thorn> it seems to and there's a stackoverflow answer that recommends it. load() doesn't work
[14:15:54] <systemfault> DevePy_: What do you mean "return ajax", you mean in the callback?
[14:16:25] <systemfault> Thorn: set a .on('load',....    handler on it before setting its src.
[14:17:18] <DevePy_> systemfault: Yes, when ajax is success and load data, not load jQuery init
[14:17:20] <Thorn> and then set a 'loaded' flag in that handler?
[14:17:55] <DevePy_> if reload page or setup console, t.myApp.init() if work
[14:20:30] <DevePy_> systemfault: you know what happen?
[14:25:19] <Thorn> systemfault: okay thanks trying
[14:35:53] <Thorn> seems to work fine, thanks

[20:48:49] <obert> neurotech: wut?
[20:49:03] <obert> neurotech: #question-rating div {} ?
[20:50:09] <neurotech> $('#question-rating').each(function(){ do stuff }); is only finding the first div in the first set

[22:41:56] <funhouse> Hi, I'm using the ajax function with jquery, however, when I try to create a new iframe for some reason it's making an ajax request to the url i specified in ajax, any ideas?
[22:49:11] <funhouse> Anyone have any ideas?
[22:55:23] <tripflex> funhouse, that doesnt make sense ... your using the ajax function and when you create a new iframe it uses the ajax request
[22:55:41] <tripflex> post it on pastebin or something or provide more details
[23:14:48] <funhouse> tripflex: yes sir
[23:19:13] <funhouse> tripflex: http://pastebin.com/MpFewzZj
[23:26:09] <tripflex> funhouse, you're using $('<iframe />' as selector?
