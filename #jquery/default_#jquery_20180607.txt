[11:21:18] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  Any way to determine if a scroll has come from a refresh/anchor or from user interaction?
[12:40:39] <MarcGuay> $(window).scrollTop(); is returning 0 when I refresh from the bottom of the page
[12:59:56] <taplar> possibly.  does the scroll bar jump/appear after the images load?
[13:12:04] <sine0> hello channel. I want to affect one div (add class|remove class) by hovering over a div so I have code and .hover is working. however when I stop hovering I want it to return back to its previous state. could I do something like a while.hover
[13:12:10] <sine0> I know thats not correct but....
[13:12:47] <taplar> hover(function, function) is the method definition
[13:12:59] <taplar> if you give it a second method, that method happens at the end of the hover
[13:14:22] <sine0> ok
[13:14:30] <sine0> so im doing a test with .hide and .show
[13:15:57] <sine0> so it runs immediatly after the first function
[13:16:28] <taplar> got a fiddle showing your issue?
[13:17:45] <sine0> sec
[13:18:54] <sine0> so basically its looping, I want it to show again when i move off
[13:18:56] <sine0> http://jsfiddle.net/Ltyv1wpd/
[13:19:18] <sine0> I mean its absolute basics i know heh
[13:20:54] <sine0> I want to hover to reveal, then reveal goes when you move off that space
[13:22:47] <sine0> mouseenter!
[13:22:47] <taplar> you didn't include any of your js in the fiddle
[13:23:12] <sine0> oh sorry
[13:23:47] <taplar> and hover() is doing it's logic based on mouseenter
[13:25:38] <taplar> but let me see if I understand this.  you want it to go invisible on hover, and show again when you leave it?
[13:25:50] <sine0> yes
[13:26:34] <sine0> http://jsfiddle.net/Ltyv1wpd/4/
[13:27:25] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/Ltyv1wpd/6/
[13:27:43] <taplar> the issue is that when you display: none something, it loses the hover effect
[13:27:58] <taplar> so you can use opacity to turn something invisible, and it will still be there.
[13:28:19] <sine0> ahh ok mate i get it thanks!
[13:28:27] <sine0> makes sense why it would loop
[13:30:03] <taplar> which all that could be done with css rules, rather than using javascript
[13:31:02] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/Ltyv1wpd/9/
[13:32:48] <sine0> its just a test, i want to do more, affect a different element..
[13:33:28] <taplar> just putting it out there in case, :)
[13:41:03] <sine0> taplar: when changing class with addClass and removeClass does it still honor the animation or transition: right 2s; etc
[13:41:31] <taplar> yes
[13:41:37] <sine0> I have a div that it outk
[13:41:39] <sine0> k
[13:41:51] <taplar> any time you change the classes on an element, the css styles will be re-evaluated
[13:43:01] <taplar> if it didn't then libraries like https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/  wouldn't make much sense, :)
[14:10:37] <SomeT> I done this code: https://hastebin.com/lokezigefe.html I get 404 not found on the API url but it should work, it works when testing it by other means (typing it directly as a url?) I also get error on line 49, my code seems perfect and I can't work out whats wrong? someone please help?
[14:11:54] <taplar> any other console messages?
[14:12:38] <SomeT> no just those two
[14:12:52] <SomeT> https://gyazo.com/4b107e8be128b2eb68421123e4ab1039
[14:12:58] <robertmaxrees> SomeT what's a known working API url.
[14:13:13] <SomeT> I know with this API sometimes I will get 404 movie not found, but law of averages a couple of refreshes usually comes up with one
[14:13:34] <SomeT> one that queries the API correctly
[14:13:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:13:47] <robertmaxrees> share a known good one out.
[14:15:19] <robertmaxrees> because that request in that hastebin works fine.
[14:15:21] <taplar> i'd also be curious in seeing the response.status logged before the if conditional
[14:15:33] <taplar> because would a 404 go into the first method of the then?
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> also - you're missing a step with your fetch.
[14:15:56] <SomeT> what step?
[14:16:21] <SomeT> it does not matter where the 404 thing goes?
[14:16:24] <robertmaxrees> gotta transform the respponse
[14:16:38] <SomeT> lost
[14:16:51] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#Making_fetch_requests
[14:17:04] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm
[14:17:06] <robertmaxrees> i see - ignore me.
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> not used to mixing curlies and non-curlies hahaha
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> either way, the ajax calls seem to be working just fine for me.
[14:17:42] <taplar> am i being stupid though?  the 404 shouldn't go in the then() right?
[14:17:59] <robertmaxrees> taplar iirc yeah - you're reight.
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> *right
[14:18:21] <taplar> so try to console.log(response.status) and see what it is
[14:18:51] <taplar> unless the endpoint is returning a 200 and putting a 404 in the response body
[14:18:53] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:18:55] <taplar> ....which i would hate
[14:19:01] <robertmaxrees> https://www.tjvantoll.com/2015/09/13/fetch-and-errors/
[14:19:20] <robertmaxrees> it'll resolve.
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> because the request successfully completed.
[14:19:32] <SomeT> yeah I can't see the issue
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> the status code doesn't dictate success or failuire.
[14:19:41] <taplar> lovely
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> SomeT something is off.
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> it works on my machine without 404s.
[14:20:07] <SomeT> ok
[14:20:26] <robertmaxrees> can you create a jsfiddle that replicates the problem?
[14:22:11] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/0dLkexyh/
[14:22:12] <SomeT> here
[14:22:16] <SomeT> but I think I found the issue?
[14:22:19] <SomeT> bracket missing?>
[14:24:11] <taplar> cors error?
[14:24:15] <SomeT> ?
[14:25:01] <robertmaxrees> $ isn't defined.
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0dLkexyh/4/
[14:25:23] <taplar> fixed that.  now i'm seeing the 'type:cors' on the response
[14:26:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that.
[14:26:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing things work just fine (shrug).
[14:26:50] <taplar> my type is always cors.  and my status is randomly 200 or 404
[14:27:04] <SomeT> ok I thiunk that works
[14:27:07] <SomeT> however
[14:27:08] <SomeT> data is not defined
[14:27:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0dLkexyh/9/
[14:27:19] <SomeT> for constole log of data.title?
[14:27:35] <robertmaxrees> also SomeT could you maybe use an example movie that isn't pornographic? ;) some of us work in an office.
[14:27:38] <SomeT> thanks
[14:27:43] <robertBusy> bbiab
[14:27:45] <SomeT> yeah sorry, I forgot to mention that
[14:27:59] <SomeT> I have that on my list: don't show porno movies
[14:28:15] <SomeT> I have to present this to university lol
[14:28:35] <SomeT> well there is a lot more I need to do, I actually written this code in JS already tbh but it was long and messy
[14:29:38] <SomeT> I still don't get why data.title is not working
[14:31:36] <SomeT> it says its undefined
[14:31:45] <SomeT> but it is defined, albeit as an argument in the function
[14:34:26] <robertBusy> back
[14:34:52] <robertmaxrees> data.title?
[14:34:57] <SomeT> yeah
[14:35:01] <SomeT> so looking through your examples
[14:35:09] <SomeT> I think I need to specify the object within the json
[14:35:18] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:35:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0dLkexyh/11/
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> there's no "articles"
[14:35:40] <SomeT> yeah
[14:35:42] <robertmaxrees> so you never hit that $.each
[14:35:49] <SomeT> exactly
[14:35:56] <SomeT> I am gonna show you my initial code
[14:36:08] <SomeT> I wanted to do in jquery because its easier to format when I append to the html you see
[14:36:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0dLkexyh/13/
[14:36:36] <robertmaxrees> just had to look at the object duder.
[14:37:15] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/3yxatosp/
[14:37:20] <SomeT> yeah I did
[14:37:24] <SomeT> that was my initial code
[14:37:34] <SomeT> but I found when adding more html elements it made things break to easily
[14:37:46] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[14:38:01] <SomeT> I can't even remember now lol
[14:38:10] <SomeT> oh wait
[14:38:20] <SomeT> yeah so in javascript I was struggling to define multiple html elements
[14:38:32] <SomeT> and in jquery I figured out how to do it in a straight forward manner
[14:39:12] <SomeT> but yeah thanks for your help
[14:39:23] <SomeT> I should really learn jquery and javascript properly lol
[14:39:31] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[14:39:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:39:44] <SomeT> thanks
[14:39:48] <SomeT> that site is useful
[14:40:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/ is awesome, too.
[14:40:59] <SomeT> I keep coming across stuff on web assembly
[14:41:07] <SomeT> honestly I can't see what the fuss is about
[14:41:17] <SomeT> other than speed improvements on utilising elements of languages like C
[14:41:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:41:27] <SomeT> which imo relates more to the IOT than the web
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> gets us closer to deploying apps via browsers.
[14:41:40] <robertmaxrees> instead of having to install things.
[14:41:47] <SomeT> but PWA already?
[14:41:56] <robertmaxrees> PWAs can make use of webassembly.
[14:42:02] <robertmaxrees> they're not mutually exclusive.
[14:42:04] <SomeT> ah
[14:42:08] <SomeT> makes sense
[14:42:14] <SomeT> I mean PWA's seem quite limited rn anyway
[14:42:19] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[14:42:38] <robertmaxrees> i have yet to find something I can do via native that I can't do via PWAs.,
[14:42:40] <SomeT> I can't find complex examples
[14:42:50] <SomeT> like most the ones I have found seem to just list data
[14:42:57] <robertmaxrees> as POCs, sure.
[14:43:03] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind not all PWAs are installable.
[14:43:07] <SomeT> um
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> but I've seen some amazing work done with them.
[14:43:20] <SomeT> its interesting though anyhow, when I get the time I will read more into all of this
[14:43:26] <SomeT> its good to see the web is ever developing
[14:43:38] <robertmaxrees> spending time at google for PWAs was eye opening.
[14:43:49] <SomeT> my main area is actually Artificial Intelligence, am a post grad studying this area
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> nice.
[14:44:04] <SomeT> so yeah, web stuff like this, the fast the better really
[14:44:11] <SomeT> *faster
[14:44:14] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:44:19] <robertmaxrees> *more readable, the better.
[14:44:27] <robertmaxrees> offload to servers as much as possible.  bam done.
[14:44:30] <SomeT> like for example my current PC is quite expensive to run GPU's locally
[14:44:42] <SomeT> I am hoping to see more improvements on the web in that area
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:44:52] <robertmaxrees> for WebGL?
[14:44:56] <SomeT> ok so for example I use MatLab a lot
[14:45:02] <SomeT> its quite a bulky program
[14:45:15] <SomeT> it would be amazing long term to see something like this but completely online
[14:45:29] <SomeT> rather than me having to run it locally, running locally costs me money in electricity
[14:45:36] <SomeT> in terms of GPU power etc...
[14:45:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean, wolframalpha is headed that direction.
[14:46:23] <robertmaxrees> you can also provision machines with awesome GPUs through amazon and the like.
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> lots of options to do that kind of stuff.
[14:47:17] <SomeT> yeah I thought about wolfram when writing that, wolfram I don't like so much
[14:47:32] <robertmaxrees> the next language he's working on looks interesting.
[14:47:32] <SomeT> wolfram is not as much of a industry standard either
[14:47:45] <SomeT> what is it? tbh I only use that site normally to check my calculus lol
[14:48:00] <robertmaxrees> wolfram
[14:48:04] <SomeT> lol
[14:48:28] <SomeT> but note though, I find in AI that USA vs Europe/UK we tend to use different ends of stuff especially in AI
[14:48:36] <SomeT> e.g. in Europe we prefer Prolog over LISP
[14:48:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah/
[14:49:44] <SomeT> although stuff like pytorch and such make things more standerised
[14:51:19] <SomeT> anyway gotta go
[14:51:23] <SomeT> thanks for the help again
[15:19:27] <GeekMonkey> Hey all
[15:19:48] <GeekMonkey> I am using Ajax with php and the function works but now it is putting a 0 in the response
[15:21:28] <taplar> can you hit the endpoint outside of ajax?
[15:23:11] <GeekMonkey> http://pasted.co/0dcf7b37
[15:23:21] <GeekMonkey> that is my code
[15:23:47] <GeekMonkey> So I will get a result as follows
[15:24:00] <GeekMonkey> Bob you review on of 5 stars was submitted.0
[15:24:33] <taplar> exit() returns 0 i believe
[15:26:05] <taplar> or at least calling makes the program end with  a status of 0
[15:28:13] <taplar> https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/116759/why-does-wordpress-add-0-zero-to-an-ajax-response
[15:58:22] <johnzuh> I have an issue similar to this one https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32023370/cube-portfolio-jquery-cubeconfig-js-show-dynamically-categories. Anyone can help_
[16:10:45] <GeekMonkey> taplar.... another thing... no I update wordpress and now I get a admin-ajax 500 error
[16:10:48] <GeekMonkey> on the frontend
[16:11:58] <taplar> what do you mean you updated wordpress?
[16:12:32] <GeekMonkey> The main wp install.... it was working before
[16:13:46] <GeekMonkey> http://pasted.co/4c214a17
[16:13:50] <GeekMonkey> This is what I have
[16:18:09] <taplar> i can't really help you there.  php/wordpress is off topic for the room.  i was just pointing out the exit() returning the 0 eariler for your first question
[17:08:15] <robertbusy> weee
[17:09:30] <SomeT> for my json query it outputs: https://gyazo.com/a689572b399cc82bff0b8594a354cc34 I want to target that specific name only in element 0, I have tried like console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[0]); in javascript / jquery however trying stuff like 0.name or putting name in brackets it never brings up the genre, how can I do this because the set theory dynamics of this problem are
[17:09:30] <SomeT> baffling me?
[17:10:08] <robertbusy> show a fiddle?
[17:10:16] <robertbusy> so we can see what you're doing via code
[17:10:23] <SomeT> ok one sec
[17:11:59] <SomeT> whats important is the stuff its showing in console log
[17:12:00] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/wcjabop6/
[17:12:25] <robertmaxrees> so feed.genres[0]
[17:12:46] <SomeT> also warning can show porn
[17:12:56] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:13:15] <SomeT> yeah but it either says undefined on js fiddle or on my computer it says [object object]
[17:13:15] <robertmaxrees> not every movie has a genre
[17:13:24] <SomeT> ok thats not important rn
[17:13:27] <SomeT> most of them do
[17:13:32] <SomeT> so thats ok
[17:13:44] <robertmaxrees> so how are you trying to access the name?
[17:13:55] <robertmaxrees> feed.genres[0] is just getting you that objkect.
[17:14:00] <robertmaxrees> *object
[17:14:04] <SomeT> yeah so undefined means theres no genre
[17:14:08] <SomeT> object object means there is
[17:14:09] <robertmaxrees> right./
[17:14:25] <SomeT> sorry at least I know whats what on that now lol
[17:14:43] <robertmaxrees> so how do you access any other property on an object? L(
[17:14:44] <SomeT> but yeah so I am accessing the object then the banalaties of accessing the text within the object is what I am struggling with
[17:14:44] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> like how are you accessing the title property on feed
[17:15:02] <SomeT> thats the thing I thought I could just do [0].nameofelement
[17:15:11] <robertmaxrees> you do.
[17:15:37] <SomeT> feed.genres[0].name
[17:15:38] <SomeT> does not work
[17:15:45] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[17:15:54] <SomeT> ncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined at fetch.then.then.feed (index.html:59)
[17:15:56] <robertmaxrees> working fine for me when there's a genres array.
[17:15:58] <SomeT> thats what I get
[17:15:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:16:09] <robertmaxrees> you'll ge tthat error if genres is an empty array.
[17:16:13] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/wcjabop6/1/
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> which is why I brought that error up./
[17:16:18] <SomeT> updated fiddle to reflect
[17:16:36] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/vHODDXd.png
[17:16:39] <robertmaxrees> like, it works fine.
[17:16:40] <SomeT> ok that works
[17:16:41] <SomeT> lol
[17:16:49] <SomeT> after all that stressing I had it right first time
[17:16:57] <robertmaxrees> you just need to add in handling for when the genre array is empty.
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> which is why i mentioned it earlier and why that was relevant ;)
[17:17:36] <SomeT> will do
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> genre = feed.genres.length ? feed.genres[0].name : '';
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[17:18:05] <SomeT> just an if function right?
[17:18:06] <SomeT> doing that
[17:18:13] <SomeT> whats the ? for?
[17:18:24] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[17:18:58] <SomeT> like an or function basically
[17:19:21] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[17:19:21] <SomeT> I done that on another site but I written this jquery code years ago
[17:19:22] <SomeT> view-source:http://aglowo.com/
[17:19:23] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[17:19:34] <robertmaxrees> that a sfw site?
[17:19:39] <SomeT> yes
[17:19:40] <SomeT> lol
[17:19:43] <SomeT> now you check haha
[17:20:00] <robertmaxrees> and btw you don't "write jquery"
[17:20:09] <robertmaxrees> like, it's not "jquery code" - it's javascript :)
[17:21:38] <SomeT> yes
[17:21:44] <SomeT> but it makes js look less shit lol
[17:22:07] <robertmaxrees> eh, not really.
[17:22:17] <robertmaxrees> it makes the dom less shit.
[17:24:04] <SomeT> yes exactly
[17:24:15] <SomeT> if (genre = feed.genres.length ? feed.genres[0].name : '';) {console.log("No genre")};
[17:24:18] <SomeT> whats wrong with that?
[17:24:23] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[17:24:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:25:28] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/9pvqf0jr/
[17:25:55] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:25:58] <SomeT> its all my brackets and such..
[17:26:07] <SomeT> I can't find a validator online that corrects it lol
[17:26:09] <robertmaxrees> if (genre = feed.genres.length ? feed.genres[0].name : '';) wat
[17:26:28] <SomeT> I just trying to get it to print an error if no genre..
[17:26:33] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:27:04] <robertmaxrees> so the semicolon shouldn't be there at all.
[17:27:14] <robertmaxrees> but don't put a ternary in an if.
[17:27:15] <SomeT> yes
[17:27:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/9pvqf0jr/2/
[17:27:40] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[17:29:42] <SomeT> even with that in
[17:29:43] <SomeT> I get
[17:29:50] <SomeT> https://gyazo.com/1985de9d2a4ecb28c6cee3fc53e41d70
[17:30:15] <SomeT> undefined = null?
[17:30:26] <SomeT> thus should '' be null whatever that is in JS
[17:30:28] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:30:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:30:38] <robertmaxrees> show me the code that's givign you that.
[17:31:17] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/916uwcg2/
[17:31:51] <SomeT> your initial jsfiddle also does the same
[17:33:12] <robertmaxrees> sec
[17:33:21] <robertmaxrees> (which "initial jsfiddle"?)
[17:34:31] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/9pvqf0jr/2/
[17:34:33] <SomeT> that one
[17:34:44] <SomeT> I mean its the same code as https://jsfiddle.net/916uwcg2/ I believe anyway
[17:35:04] <robertmaxrees> they're not the same.
[17:35:17] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* lol
[17:35:18] <SomeT> lol
[17:35:26] <SomeT> I just copied the bit I thought had changed
[17:35:27] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[17:35:49] <SomeT> but even so both codes produce the same error
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> not my code that's the problem here.
[17:36:18] <robertmaxrees> console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[0].name + feed.genres[1].name); // for testing / debugging
[17:36:29] <robertmaxrees> you're still trying to use that name.
[17:36:54] <robertmaxrees> both have a console.log that tries to access that property.
[17:37:15] <robertmaxrees> make sure that's after thr genre var and that you use the var.
[17:37:21] <robertmaxrees> *the
[17:38:19] <robertmaxrees> see what i mean?
[17:40:11] <SomeT> no
[17:40:40] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/VuJxpDI.png
[17:40:46] <robertmaxrees> that's the line that's erroring./
[17:41:34] <robertmaxrees> not the ternary
[17:41:48] <SomeT> ah ok
[17:41:49] <SomeT> one sec
[17:42:00] <SomeT> I changed that to
[17:42:00] <SomeT> console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[0].name);
[17:42:05] <SomeT> and it still gives same
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> right...
[17:42:26] <robertmaxrees> because feed.genres[0] doesn't exist.
[17:42:35] <robertmaxrees> delete that link and the error will go aweay.
[17:42:37] <robertmaxrees> *away
[17:43:21] <SomeT> so this is doing the same thing right?: genre = feed.genres.length ? feed.genres[0].name
[17:43:35] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:43:47] <SomeT> if I delete that line then how will it get the genre?
[17:43:48] <robertmaxrees> did you read the mdn page i linkced?
[17:43:59] <SomeT> yes
[17:44:01] <robertmaxrees> you keep the line with the ternary.
[17:44:20] <robertmaxrees> that ternary isn't causing that error.
[17:44:24] <robertmaxrees> the console.log before it is.
[17:44:59] <SomeT> ah
[17:45:10] <robertmaxrees> that's why i drew that square around that line.
[17:45:14] <SomeT> sorry I misread
[17:45:21] <robertmaxrees> make sense now?
[17:45:26] <SomeT> I am dyslexic and the red box made my eyes go funny lol
[17:45:26] <SomeT> yeah
[17:47:44] <SomeT> I did one extra
[17:47:51] <SomeT> else {console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[0].name); }
[17:47:55] <SomeT> that completely fixes it
[17:48:05] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> what's in the if???
[17:48:22] <robertmaxrees> if it's the ternary...
[17:49:05] <SomeT> https://gyazo.com/5b942b52cc39964452e273c83f3026e5
[17:49:09] <SomeT> it would be like that
[17:49:11] <SomeT> I mean it works...
[17:49:49] <robertmaxrees> oh that's fine/
[17:49:55] <SomeT> :)
[17:49:58] <robertmaxrees> though 2 suggestions.
[17:50:19] <SomeT> although its weird changine line {console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[0].name); to {console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[1].name);
[17:50:22] <SomeT> makes it break again
[17:50:27] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:50:28] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[17:50:41] <robertmaxrees> 1: invert your if / else so the "successful" condition comes first.
[17:50:42] <SomeT> so I can fix with another if else statement?
[17:50:52] <robertmaxrees> 2: format your curlies the right way.
[17:50:55] <SomeT> what do you mean by invert?
[17:51:29] <robertmaxrees> if (genre) { console.log('genre of this film/movie') } else { console.log('no genre') };
[17:51:44] <SomeT> not following
[17:51:45] <SomeT> sorry
[17:51:52] <robertmaxrees> link to code please.
[17:51:53] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[17:52:53] <SomeT> https://hastebin.com/ijoxibiwag.html
[17:53:09] <SomeT> or
[17:53:09] <SomeT> https://hastebin.com/raw/ijoxibiwag
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/63ed31572550
[17:54:40] <SomeT> ah
[17:54:41] <SomeT> makes sense
[17:55:14] <SomeT> did you make a mistake on line 3?
[17:55:17] <SomeT> you forgot the !
[17:55:22] <SomeT> or is that intentional?
[17:55:31] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:55:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:55:55] <SomeT> :'(
[17:55:59] <robertmaxrees> look at the body of what gets run if it's true....
[17:56:03] <robertmaxrees> console.log("Genre of film / movie: " + feed.genres[0].name);
[17:56:10] <SomeT> so the answer to that is yes
[17:56:20] <robertmaxrees> that was indeed intentional.
[17:56:28] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it wouldn't function the same wayu.
[17:56:31] <robertmaxrees> (wya
[17:56:35] <robertmaxrees> wtf hahaha
[17:56:43] <taplar> day drinking
[17:56:53] <SomeT> I don't get along with JS
[17:57:06] <robertmaxrees> SomeT erm, that's not a JS-specific idiom.
[17:57:40] <SomeT> I would not even know
[17:57:51] <SomeT> I just code from guesswork in JS lol
[17:58:00] <SomeT> because I have programming experience in other languages
[17:58:06] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:58:54] <robertmaxrees> brb
