[00:05:00] <znow> Hi! Im using tje jCarouselLite Jquery plugin for a site. it slides some pictures. Is it possible, WHEN you hover an image in the slider, the auto function in the slider stops? and when you remove the pointer from the image, the slider continues? :)
[00:08:32] <gf3> znow: looks like you'll have to add that functionality yourself
[00:09:11] <znow> gf3; yes, im abit aware of that, all though im a noob @ JS, so I would appreciate if I could harvest some help in here :)
[00:12:23] <gf3> znow: you'll need to store the setInterval ID, then you can add a stop function
[00:13:36] <Trudko> Guys I have child nodes which looks like this <tr class="child-of-1562348 initialized" id="1562347"> <tr class="child-of-1562349 initialized" id="1562346"> How to write selector for these if number at the end is not the same? Parent.find() ??
[00:13:49] <juha___> http://pics.kuvaton.com/kuvei/clever_british_coins.jpg woooot
[00:14:05] <znow> gf3: where do I retrieve the setInterval ID? cant I just wrap the whole function in some .hover function with some halt or something?
[00:14:16] <znow> gf3: really bad at this :P you wanna see some code?
[00:14:31] <gf3> znow: you have to add the "halt" function
[00:16:24] <coldhead> Trudko: it's ugly but $('[class^=child-of-whatever]')
[00:16:30] <Trudko> anyone? Seems easy but not sure how to do that
[00:16:35] <coldhead> also id^=
[00:16:57] <coldhead> ?tias
[00:17:15] <gf3> also, really bad class name
[00:17:25] <Trisox> whats that juha___
[00:17:42] <Trisox> hey coldie
[00:18:09] <Trudko> coldhead: ok thx this should work
[00:18:38] <Trudko> cold and how to write it with $(this) object?
[00:18:56] <znow> gf3: ? wanna see some code? :)
[00:18:57] <ChrisA132> Has anyone ever used www.stealthtrades.com ?
[00:19:00] <Trudko> coldhead: *
[00:19:14] <gf3> znow: sure
[00:19:57] <znow> gf3: https://gist.github.com/992704 <-
[00:22:09] <gf3> znow: you've done nothing...
[00:22:50] <znow> gf3; exactly, cause I dunno how I should approach... wrap the whole function in a .hover function with an if and halt or?
[00:22:56] <znow> gf3: thats why I ask mate
[00:23:24] <Trudko> guys if I have object $(this) with $('[class^=child-of-whatever]')
[00:23:35] <gf3> znow: you're going to have to modify the jscarousellite source
[00:23:57] <seutje> what's he trying to do?
[00:24:00] <znow> gf3: w00t... is it that erhhhh... hard?
[00:24:04] <znow> seutje: I have this carousel
[00:24:22] <znow> seutje: with images that is on auto. BUT when I hover an image, is should stop the auto
[00:24:23] <gf3> znow: in there, you need to store the return value of `setInterval`, then in your `stop` function (which you will be adding), you can `clearInterval` that value
[00:24:26] <seutje> coz like 9/10 jCarousel doesn't fit my use-case
[00:24:28] <alkavan> hay... i'm trying to create a script that do the next: in element with 9 box, if user press on box 7 then 8 will fadeOut() then 6 then 9 then 5, 4, 3, ... then go to link. anyone can assist with logic of the fadeout timing?
[00:24:37] <alkavan> 9 boxs even.
[00:25:02] <gf3> seutje: he would like to stop the carousel arbitrarily
[00:25:26] <znow> seutje: yes, as gf3 says, when I hover the carousels image, it should stop as long as its hovered.
[00:27:13] <seutje> yea, I don't think jcarousel can be paused/resumed arbitrarily
[00:27:24] <gf3> no
[00:27:33] <gf3> http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/js/jcarousellite_1.0.1.js
[00:27:44] <seutje> wat
[00:27:46] <gf3> he'll have to save that setInterval
[00:28:17] <gf3> ("no" as in "no, you're right, seutje")
[00:28:41] <seutje> I'm as surprised as u
[00:28:43] <larsemil> To have users submit posts wihout being registered - is TDO miniforms the best alternative?
[00:28:50] <larsemil> sry wrong channel
[00:28:58] <larsemil> :)
[00:28:58] <larsemil> <3
[00:28:59] <gf3> OMG RUDE
[00:29:00] <znow> gf3: okay, in the source, I should find setInterval yes?
[00:29:01] <seutje> no sry, only hpy
[00:29:09] <gf3> znow: yes
[00:29:17] <znow> gf3: sec then
[00:29:41] <seutje> u have no idea how many times I've started with jCarousel, and ended up writing my own
[00:29:59] <znow> gf3: if(o.auto)setInterval( <- line 53
[00:30:06] <znow> I found setInterval there
[00:30:08] <gf3> mhmm
[00:30:31] <seutje> perhaps u could turn off autoscrolling and do it urself
[00:30:58] <znow> seutje: as I told gf3, im really bad at JS :p... so dunno how I should approach it
[00:31:08] <znow> seutje: and not make it more complicated
[00:31:19] <gf3> this will be a magical journey for you :)
[00:31:26] <gf3> ?eloquent @ znow
[00:31:32] <Trudko> guys whats the problem with this code
[00:31:32] <znow> gf3: im an easy learner :)
[00:31:33] <Trudko> http://jsfiddle.net/5Kg55/
[00:31:37] <seutje> nobot @ gf3
[00:31:43] <gf3> WTFFFF @ seutje
[00:32:06] <gf3> znow: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[00:32:06] <joshellington> seutje jCarousel = sad face
[00:33:00] <joshellington> Trudko your find() selector isn't correct
[00:33:21] <joshellington> $("#test').find('.child-of-test');
[00:33:32] <joshellington> $("#test').find('.child-of-test').each(function() { });
[00:33:46] <znow> gf3: well, I would ask you guys for help, its not that I dont wanna read that site, but im really bad at constructing JS together
[00:35:55] <gf3> znow: Eloquent is a good introduction to JS
[00:36:07] <seutje> joshellington: it is, his use of brackets just isn't
[00:36:36] <seutje> Trudko: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }" should be a hint
[00:36:51] <joshellington> seutje ahhh yes
[00:36:56] <joshellington> seutje woops
[00:40:36] <Trudko> joshellington: how about $("#test').find('.child-of-').each(function() { }); because the last word(in this case test) will change
[00:41:07] <Trudko> joshellington: in real chode I have <tr class="child-of-1562348 initialized" id="1562347"> and number will change
[00:41:14] <Trudko> will be dynamic
[00:41:31] <gf3> it would be easier/better if you just used real classes
[00:42:35] <phrearch> hi
[00:43:18] <gf3> NO U
[00:43:42] <phrearch> im building a simple blog engine, and want to make a simple wysywyg for the editor. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/rich-text_editing_in_mozilla seems to be a good source, but i wonder how you can set for instance bold on by default, when typing
[00:43:53] <Disperati2> !ask
[00:45:36] <Disperati2> !ask hey guys is there anyway i can put a variable in $('#someid').attr('name', 'var'); instead of the value?
[00:46:53] <ajpiano> Disperati2, just do it
[00:47:10] <ajpiano> var foo = "whatever";  $("#something").attr("name", foo);
[00:47:13] <Trudko> seutje: heh yeah you are right  so whats the best final solution if I have not divs but <tr class="child-of-1562348 initialized" id="1562347"> and number will be dynamical (based on parent)
[00:47:15] <ajpiano> also... goodnight!!

[00:57:47] <Guest96100> hi, is this possible in jquery to set different ajax post options? I want to measure mobile browser's ajax timeout but I need my app's communication running. So, I need continous ajax requests happening AND one more request i'll send that will inevitably fail, and I could tell when that happen by using "error" property. To do this i need to set this error property but only for that failing request (the rest of the communication hav
[00:57:47] <Guest96100> own error handling)

[01:36:17] <pallet> morning all
[01:37:20] <Disperati2> !ask another question :D how can i change the onclick value of a given id?
[01:37:31] <m0dmd> morning!!!
[01:37:41] <Disperati2> g'morning...
[01:37:58] <pallet> I'm looking for a demo of a drag n drop type application, basically I need a toolbox with some graphical elements in it, then I can drag them out and onto a workplace,
[01:38:07] <Guest96100> Disperati2: $('#id').attr('onclick', 'newvalue'); ?
[01:38:15] <pallet> basically it's going to be a gui type form designer
[01:38:28] <Disperati2> tried that, doesn't seem to like it... Guest96100
[01:38:58] <jrockjiggz> Disperati2: try someElement.onclick = function() {}
[01:43:56] <seutje> sweet, this obscure safari 5 issue just fixed itself overnight \o/
[01:44:15] <m0dmd> pallet, you gotta start with the drag & drop basics
[01:44:25] <m0dmd> Everything you need is in jquery-ui demos and documentation
[01:45:01] <seutje> what if he needs a cure for cancer?
[01:45:14] <seutje> he'll come up sorely disappointed, now won't he
[01:47:13] <m0dmd> jrockjiggz you there?
[01:47:23] <m0dmd> seutje nope, jquery got the cure!
[01:47:27] <jrockjiggz> 30 dragndrop plugins http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/freebies/drag-drop-jquery-plugins/
[01:47:43] <jrockjiggz> m0dmd: yes i am
[01:47:53] <m0dmd> mind checking out the third song for me
[01:47:56] <m0dmd> got the player in the drop down
[01:48:02] <m0dmd> if you got the time
[01:48:16] <m0dmd> the song I Give You Bass
[01:48:28] <jrockjiggz> yes, it plays
[01:48:37] <m0dmd> awesome. now to add the upload functionality
[01:48:51] <m0dmd> So close, can't wait to puff on the cigar!
[01:48:55] <jrockjiggz> what player is that?
[01:49:45] <jrockjiggz> for uploader - you may be interest ing jQuery-file-upload https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[01:49:58] <m0dmd> http://www.flabell.com/flash-components#sorttype:downloads-sortmode:desc-filter:free-view:details-onepage:no-perPage:10-page:1
[01:50:23] <m0dmd> nah i need the user to enter in the name of the song and artist information, so it's just going to be a basic uploader form.
[01:50:47] <m0dmd> I've used blueimp
[01:50:51] <m0dmd> as well as uploadify.

[02:00:11] <hahuang65> hey guys, what does this selector find?
[02:00:14] <hahuang65> $.placeholder?
[02:00:56] <pomodoro> is a variable or function
[02:00:59] <pomodoro> not a selector
[02:01:12] <hahuang65> pomodoro: my question is this
[02:01:12] <hahuang65> https://github.com/jcampbell1/jquery-html5-placeholder-shim
[02:01:13] <pomodoro> maybe its a plugin
[02:01:15] <hahuang65> how does that work
[02:01:47] <quicksilver> if you want to know how it works, read the source?
[02:01:52] <quicksilver> https://github.com/jcampbell1/jquery-html5-placeholder-shim/blob/master/jquery.html5-placeholder-shim.js
[02:02:10] <pomodoro> inpuy type="text"
[02:02:12] <pomodoro> input
[02:02:28] <pomodoro> input[placeholder] only takes elements with the placeholder attr set
[02:02:45] <hahuang65> i see.
[02:03:46] <pomodoro> i found this plugin better btw
[02:03:47] <pomodoro> https://github.com/peol/jquery.html5.placeholder
[02:04:05] <pomodoro> did some research while ago and this one had the least issues
[02:09:46] <osmosis_paul> Somebody know how select a default value in a dropbox when you have to iterate a dinamic list?
[02:13:28] <kettle> Heyy jQueers
[02:13:39] <Deele> hi
[02:13:40] <kettle> Anyway to target the scrollbar with jQuery
[02:13:42] <kettle> Like.. $( "::-webkit-scrollbar" )
[02:13:46] <kettle> Onlt a way that works
[02:13:55] <kettle> That's the CSS selector for it
[02:14:16] <pomodoro> don't think the scrollbar is a dom object
[02:14:22] <pomodoro> what ya wanna do with it?
[02:14:28] <kettle> Yea, it's not, I was hoping there was a different way
[02:14:38] <_foobar> I have a problem with $.attr function in ie8
[02:14:38] <_foobar> The following line works in FF, Chrome & Opera: $.attr( 'style', '' )
[02:14:53] <_foobar> anyone hou know what to do to get it to work in ie?
[02:14:54] <kettle> pomodoro: I'm trying to replicate the iOS scrollbar so it only shows up whenever I start to scroll
[02:15:03] <sean`> _foobar, that's weird
[02:15:14] <_foobar> sean`: yes :)
[02:15:18] <pomodoro> _foobar: why not use $().css() ?
[02:15:21] <sean`> $.attr( 'style', '' )
[02:15:30] <sean`> $.attr takes an element as first argument
[02:15:49] <pomodoro> kettle: you've got to make ur own thing im afraid
[02:15:51] <sean`> $(element).attr ('style', 'foo') would be better
[02:15:55] <sean`> but yeah, use .css _foobar
[02:16:00] <_foobar> pomodoro:  I'm tryiong to reset the value
[02:16:17] <_foobar> How can I do that with css?
[02:16:32] <_foobar> I know about the selector..
[02:16:48] <pomodoro> is the style set in the attribute or in the stylesheet?
[02:16:58] <_foobar> I have a working one ofc seens it works in the other browsres
[02:17:07] <_foobar> attr
[02:17:27] <_foobar> @ pomodoro:
[02:18:26] * _foobar bumping
[02:19:27] <pomodoro> _foobar: don't know about a ie8 specific issue, try stackoverflow
[02:20:37] <sean`> _foobar, why don't you set up a jsfiddle
[02:21:16] <pallet> Are there any freelancers here ?
[02:21:28] <pallet> who have Drag/Drop experience ?
[02:21:51] <cuQa> i got dragged and dropped in the mud a couple of times
[02:22:01] <cuQa> but not a professional in it :/
[02:22:12] <pallet> same as ;)
[02:22:30] <_foobar> sean`: never worked tith it, and the project is 1200 lines.. think I should start off smaler
[02:22:46] <pomodoro> im a freelancer, but only basic drag drop experience
[02:23:12] <AdvoWork> im using jquery for my table styling, but when i load my page, it shows the normal html first, and then styles it, but this takes a few seconds. any reason why theres a delay, or if I can stop the delay?
[02:23:50] <pomodoro> AdvoWork: does the page run at document load?
[02:23:52] <sean`> _foobar, you know
[02:23:58] <sean`> if you watnt o get style and then set style
[02:24:03] <sean`> you just need 1 element, and a few lines of JS
[02:24:04] <sean`> it's not that hard
[02:24:51] <AdvoWork> pomodoro, its just a normal html page within a popup window, and all my jquery is within $(document).ready(function() {
[02:26:10] <Draconisle> popup has ajax?
[02:26:23] <pomodoro> there should be anything delaying it in jquery, is it a big table? can't it be styled using css? what if you put the styling at the top?
[02:26:38] <pomodoro> yeah, you could run the sript up front before showing then
[02:28:06] <Draconisle> if for some reason your styling is triggered by an event, then it would appear like there is a delay
[02:28:32] <Draconisle> i would try a basic style and see if that works or not without delay
[02:28:58] <Draconisle> i would also try css
[02:29:03] <_foobar> sean`: pomodoro: if I enter a value as a second param it worsk.. :P
[02:29:03] <_foobar> this wont work: $.attr('style', '')
[02:29:03] <_foobar> This will work: $.attr('style', ' ')
[02:29:22] <_foobar> where can I report a bug?
[02:29:31] <sean`> wtf
[02:29:41] <pomodoro> _foobar: nice!, didn't know
[02:29:45] <sean`> _foobar, pastebin your code
[02:29:49] <sean`> or set up a jsfiddle
[02:29:55] <_foobar> 1200 lines mate?
[02:30:05] <sean`> _foobar, what do y ou think?
[02:30:12] <_foobar> soon I will post a git hub on it
[02:30:15] <sean`> "Shall I paste 1200 lines, or just stuff that' relevant?"
[02:30:19] <sean`> Ask yourself
[02:30:26] <AdvoWork> pomodoro, tried putting it as the top, didnt really make much difference, its a table of about 90 rows, with 13 columns in  and i tried adding the jquery class names to the actual tds, th etc, but no difference
[02:30:29] <sean`> You want help, you work for it
[02:30:58] <_foobar> sean`: I have alredy posted the info here that is relevent
[02:31:12] <sean`> <_foobar> this wont work: $.attr('style', '')
[02:31:13] <_foobar> I can set up a dummy if u like.. but the problem is fixed
[02:31:14] <bjensen> $(this).parent).siblings("span.hidden").children(".ingredient_id") can I make this into a selector?
[02:31:20] <sean`> I cannot believe that is your literal code
[02:31:25] <pomodoro> Advp
[02:31:31] <pomodoro> AdvoWork: sorry don't know then
[02:31:37] <_foobar> okok.. here it comes nthe
[02:31:39] <Draconisle> AdvoWork: you have a 90 row table inside a popup window?
[02:31:53] <_foobar> clone.attr( 'style', ' ' );
[02:31:54] <AdvoWork> Draconisle, yes, thats nothing new..
[02:32:04] <_foobar> the clone is a clone from a selector
[02:32:17] <_foobar> @ sean`
[02:32:28] <sean`> ok, so clone.attr is your code
[02:32:30] <_foobar> $ is short for jQuery obj
[02:32:32] <sean`> then don't tell me it's $.
[02:32:35] <sean`> NO it isn't
[02:32:41] <_foobar> ok..
[02:32:44] <Draconisle> so this is an ajax call?
[02:32:46] <sean`> _foobar, pasetbin all 1200 lines
[02:32:52] <sean`> I'll do your work for you, I guess?
[02:32:54] <_foobar> no thank u..
[02:32:55] <Draconisle> how are you creating the table?
[02:33:19] <dragoonis> sean`: play nice with the other  children!
[02:33:33] <sean`> :>
[02:34:05] <dragoonis> wheres the JQ 1.6 changelog ?
[02:34:21] <sean`> blog.jquery.com covers it all
[02:34:32] <sean`> also a blog post on resig's blog
[02:34:44] <Draconisle> http://blog.jquery.com/
[02:34:49] <Draconisle> doh
[02:34:53] <Draconisle> sean beat me to it
[02:35:06] <seutje> he's a quick lil fucker, isn't he?
[02:35:20] <Draconisle> must have faster google skilss than me?
[02:35:30] <Draconisle> skills*
[02:35:39] <seutje> or he's closer to the source
[02:35:43] <Draconisle> hehe
[02:36:21] <seutje> prolly chillin on the porch of a datacenter
[02:45:09] <_foobar> regarding what I typed earlyer.. due to version 1.6.1 it works with $.attr('style','')
[02:45:09] <_foobar> I was using 1.5.2
[02:45:09] <_foobar> In what version it started woking, I dont know
[02:47:08] <Disperati2> !ask guys, let me explain...im using the append function to add some selects in the form, but i have to change their id and names to something else
[02:47:37] <Disperati2> everything seems to be fine now i just used the .attr to change their values
[02:47:53] <Disperati2> now i put a button to remove the select
[02:49:18] <Disperati2> $("id" + var).onclick = function() { $("idcontainer" + var).remove();}
[02:49:47] <Disperati2> but that doesnt work
[02:50:13] <Disperati2> where id is the id of the "remove" button
[02:50:26] <Cork> Disperati2: you need # if you want to select id's
[02:50:31] <Disperati2> and idcontainer is the container of the select added
[02:50:49] <Disperati2> $("#id" + var).onclick = function() { $("idcontainer" + var).remove();} like this Cork ?
[02:51:05] <Cork> no $("#idcontainer" + var) too
[02:51:09] <seutje> r u trying to put an onclick property on a jQuery collection?
[02:51:20] <seutje> needs [0], no?
[02:51:27] <Cork> and ya its just click in jquery :)
[02:51:36] <seutje> and it's a method
[02:51:41] <seutje> ?click @ Disperati2
[02:51:54] <Cork> $("#id" + var).click(function() { $("#idcontainer" + var).remove();});
[02:52:26] <seutje> Disperati2: http://api.jquery.com/click/ && http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[02:52:44] <seutje> onclick attributes make baby Resig cry
[02:53:00] <dragoonis> So when do i use .prop() on normal DOM elements and when to use attr() ?
[02:53:00] <Cork> :)
[02:53:08] <dragoonis> I get the whole (window) and (document) uses
[02:53:58] <seutje> attr = a real attribute on an element
[02:54:04] <seutje> prop = arbitrary propery
[02:54:44] <Disperati2> hmmm not working...
[02:55:06] <BlackArts> Hi, is there a function that'll detect when I'm changing the page, I need to save a cookie when user click on link and goes to another page.
[02:55:30] <BlackArts> I tried unload, but that works when I'm closing the browser
[02:55:34] <Cork> Disperati2: it would help if you post your code at http://jsfiddle.net
[02:55:37] <seutje> like $('div').prop('lawlercakes', 'hihi') won't put lawlercakes="hihi" on all divs iirc
[02:55:46] <Disperati2> k cork
[02:56:05] <dragoonis> seutje: only valid DOM attributes will work on .attr()? and for everything else it must be prop() ?
[02:56:20] <dragoonis> BlackArts: theres a callback to detect closing the page, not sure if its about leaving (switching tabs)
[02:56:36] <dragoonis> seutje: so 'aria' options are now .prop() ?
[02:56:46] <seutje> wat?
[02:56:51] <seutje> but those are real attributes
[02:56:59] <dragoonis> ok my bad. i'm not an aria guru :)
[02:57:04] <seutje> ?g jquery prop vs attr
[02:57:08] <seutje> right...
[02:57:11] <dragoonis> lol...
[02:57:13] <Cork> bot-t is dead :)
[02:57:19] <Cork> still dead rather :)
[02:57:28] <BlackArts> not switching tabs, but when I click on a link, page unloads and next one loads
[02:57:29] <dragoonis> seutje: any more examples of .prop()
[02:57:46] <dragoonis> BlackArts: put a callback on all <a> clicks
[02:58:03] <BlackArts> I hoped to avoid that
[02:58:06] <Cork> BlackArts: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[02:58:41] <seutje> Dr4g: how nice of u to change names after posing a question
[02:58:50] <seutje> Dr4g: the usual example is checked
[02:58:52] <Dr4g> xD you're welcome
[02:58:58] <BlackArts> thanks
[02:59:14] <seutje> .attr('checked') returns "checked" in 1.6, the actual value of the attribute
[02:59:26] <Disperati2> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/vvW52/
[02:59:28] <seutje> .prop('checked') will return true in 1.6
[02:59:40] <seutje> like .attr('checked') used to do
[02:59:47] <Disperati2> Cork
[03:00:17] <Cork> thats my nick, ya
[03:00:26] <seutje> ooh, localized coads, my favorite -_-
[03:01:40] <daxim_> http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/10757.Best_JavaScript_Books   # as a Perl programmer, I appreciate the humour
[03:01:47] <seutje> Disperati2: maaaan, conta_pizze is a lie
[03:01:59] <Disperati2> hm?
[03:02:10] <seutje> console tells me it's a lie
[03:02:26] <Cork> Disperati2: why are you changing the id of the elements?
[03:02:26] <daxim_> better cancella it!
[03:02:29] <Dr4g> seutje: i got you
[03:02:31] <Dr4g> thanks
[03:02:46] <Disperati2> because i have to pass the names to php
[03:03:00] <Cork> thats name, not id
[03:03:39] <K1ng> `ers
[03:04:06] <Cork> Disperati2: and ontop of that, why do you have the span at all?
[03:04:06] <Disperati2> i have to get "pizza1=value" pizza2=value
[03:04:31] <Dr4g> daxim_: i used to work as a perl dev too.. god help your soul
[03:04:33] <Cork> Disperati2: theres a difference between name and id
[03:04:55] <Disperati2> its just temporary, the layout is not ready
[03:05:17] <Cork> Disperati2: can you make the pb complete?
[03:05:27] <Cork> with how the form looks like and things like that?
[03:05:28] <Disperati2> pb?
[03:05:32] <Disperati2> k
[03:05:42] <Cork> PasteBin :)
[03:05:47] <Disperati2> its quite complex tho
[03:06:01] <Cork> Disperati2: just include what input fields is in there
[03:06:05] <Cork> you don't need all of it
[03:06:11] <Cork> just all thats relevant
[03:06:20] <Disperati2> exactly..
[03:10:59] <luc2> hello, doesn't this work ? <script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl" src="external_template_file.tmpl">
[03:13:17] <alexparker> Goodnight folks
[03:13:57] <Disperati2> here it is http://pastebin.com/FtCuQNpp Cork
[03:14:59] <Disperati2> forgot to paste <div id ="altre"></div> before the form closing tag
[03:15:47] <Disperati2> the values passing to php is just fine, i just cant remove a #template + var
[03:19:33] <Disperati2> maybe its the line 16, can i change the ID of a given id? kinda recursive
[03:30:28] <Disperati2> anyone? :D
[03:32:12] <Disperati2> Cork, ?
[03:34:25] <AdvoWork> ive got some code opening a dialog, on there i have a button which i do: $("#add_single_sort").click(add_single_sort);   and the add_single_sort function just does an alert. this works, but then it tries to submit something.. any ideas? ive got no submit code
[03:38:09] <bjhaid> I saw this jquery plugin for image enlargement, I added to my rails app, but it was not functioning, this is the pastie http://pastie.org/1975509
[03:41:04] <zxm|2> hi guys. I need to add close button to the header of ui datepicker. What is the best way to do that? Datepicker is displayed inline.
[03:49:03] <ShawnRisk> I am trying to create a way to have a horizontal slider that lets me add the pager there when it slides out.  When I do this the slider and the pager disappears, how do I do this?  Example: ecosanity.org
[03:49:24] <Disperati2> Cork, !
[04:06:18] <bjensen> um how do I get the most info about a javascript object? I have a function(e){}.. and I would like to get some detials on e
[04:12:10] <ablomen> bjensen, console.log(e);
[04:12:22] <ablomen> open up the chrome debugger or firebug on firefox
[04:12:29] <bjensen> ablomen: it just tells me its an object
[04:12:41] <bjensen> and I knew that already ;-)
[04:12:59] <ablomen> bjensen, what browser/version?
[04:13:02] <bjensen> ablomen: [object Object]
[04:13:14] <bjensen> firefox 4.01
[04:13:39] <ablomen> then you should be able to view the object, it seems that the object gets converted to a string
[04:13:47] <Disperati2> seutje, what kinda console do you use to debug?
[04:13:57] <ShawnRisk> any ideas on my question?
[04:13:58] <ablomen> which should not happen if you just do function (e) { console.log(e); }
[04:15:19] <xec> anyone know if theres a way to see if/what events are bound to an element with firebug?
[04:15:45] <quicksilver> xec: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1236067/test-if-event-handler-is-bound-to-an-element-in-jquery

[04:19:04] <ShawnRisk> I am trying to create a way to have a slider that lets me add the pager there when it slides out.  When I do this the slider and the pager disappears, how do I do this?  Example: http://ecosanity.org/
[04:19:39] <AdvoWork> ive got some code opening a dialog, on there i have a button which i do: $("#add_single_sort").click(add_single_sort);   and the add_single_sort function just does an alert. this works, but then it tries to submit something.. any ideas? ive got no submit code
[04:25:35] <AdvoWork> its defuinately going to the form action some how..
[04:26:51] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: you have not given any information to help anyone solve your problem.
[04:26:56] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: so you're not going to get any help.
[04:27:03] <quicksilver> Your question reads like this:
[04:27:29] <quicksilver> I have a button which does <something totally irrelvant> and the irrelevant thing works, but then it tries to submit something - why?
[04:27:45] <quicksilver> so if you agree (as do I) that the code you pasted is the *irrelevant* part, then how can we help you?
[04:28:03] <quicksilver> we need to see the code with the bug in. If you don't know which part that is, we need to see all of it
[04:29:42] <Trisox> any one used jquery validate before? it works on name.... i need it to work on on id.. any ideas ?
[04:31:03] <PPP> HI

[04:34:59] <thathurts> hey guys let's say i have 6MB worth of json data at a url. if i use jQuery.getJSON, will it actually have to load that entire 6mb, or will it only send the stuff it needs down the wire?
[04:35:25] <Deele> it will push all 6mb, as they are requested
[04:35:32] <daxim_> everything, of course.  what made you think otherwise?
[04:35:34] <Deele> everything depends on your request and server side, that answers
[04:37:57] <shomon> is there a good channel to ask about ie7 quirks in general? got some problems with some content in a thickbox...
[04:39:18] <nafr1> hello, i want to design a web application that would support multiple themes. is there any theme engine available for jquery?? (i am fairly new to jquery)
[04:40:24] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, http://pastebin.com/mE7RzE5c  clicking add single sort does the alert, and then submits to the form action..
[04:41:54] <thathurts> isn't there any way to stream json from a url
[04:44:49] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: buttons are submit buttons by default.
[04:44:59] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: you could return 0; from your callback to make them not submit.
[04:45:07] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: or you could change their type so they do not submit.
[04:46:08] <sg> hi
[04:46:35] <ShawnRisk> hi
[04:52:23] <ShawnRisk> How do I combine a slider with a pager?  I am making a slideshow, and want the numbers of the images and description to popup when I hover over the image.  I can get the slider to work, but not with the pager.  Any thoughts?

[04:54:04] <seutje> what's that?
[04:55:59] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, ahh i didnt know that, how can i make that button not a submit button then? without doing the return 90
[04:56:20] <AdvoWork> just type="button"?
[04:56:53] <Multiply> Wouldn't strtotime('first day next month'); return 06/01 00.00.00 ?
[04:56:57] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: read the HTML standard.
[04:57:13] <Multiply> Uh

[05:06:35] <smarts> hi all, any idea why the DataTable custom date sort would find OLD DOM HTML when called to sort rather than what is currently on the page?
[05:06:54] <smarts> see : http://datatables.net/plug-ins/sorting
[05:07:01] <smarts> Date dd/mm/yy
[05:08:05] <smarts> sean ^^ ?
[05:08:15] <sean`> smarts, got link?
[05:08:29] <smarts> http://pastie.org/1973246
[05:08:31] <smarts> that is my code
[05:08:46] <smarts> when I click on sort, it enters in and what is in the A variable is OLD HTML
[05:08:50] <smarts> not the current stuff
[05:08:55] <smarts> that has been rewritten
[05:09:10] <smarts> it is almost like it caputred the state of the dom at the time
[05:09:12] <seutje> sean`: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FX2j-63emxU
[05:09:18] <smarts> when it was loaded on startup
[05:09:25] <smarts> and is ignoring the current state
[05:10:29] <sean`> lololol

[05:23:37] <smarts> hi all, any idea why the DataTable custom date sort would find OLD DOM HTML when called to sort rather than what is currently on the page?
[05:23:59] <smarts> Raverix, hammi paulatrothbury SkiOne ablomen Torava ^^
[05:24:38] <Raverix> smarts: Caching.
[05:24:47] <smarts> hmm
[05:24:53] <smarts> I should clear my JS cace?
[05:24:56] <smarts> will try
[05:25:33] <Raverix> No, you asked any idea why the datatable would sort on old dom html instead of what's currently on the page.
[05:25:43] <Raverix> The answer to that question, is that the datatable is caching something.
[05:25:51] <smarts> hmm
[05:26:02] <smarts> I see
[05:29:29] <toot> quick q - anyone know the correct way to 'scale' in jQuery but scaling from the center point as opposed to top/left? :)
[05:31:05] <coldhead> i don't think the a is as quick as the q
[05:31:26] <coldhead> it would depend on how the element is positioned i think
[05:32:25] <Raverix> toot: The a is to offset the top/left by half of the amount you scale up.
[05:32:59] <Raverix> The method you use to offset the top / left is as cold/head said, dependent upon how that element is positioned.
[05:33:17] <toot> ah okay - cool :) thank yous!
[05:36:34] <coldhead> lol /
[05:41:03] <djQuery> toot: there is also see ?.ui.position
[05:41:18] <djQuery> damn bot
[05:41:42] <djQuery> toot: http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[05:46:06] <Whirl3d> Good morning y'all. I have a quick question for you: I have an animated panel that flys up from the bottom of the page. I need to listen for mouseclicks outside the panel to have it automatically close. What's the best way to handle that?
[05:47:01] <djQuery> Whirl3d: $('#annoyingpanel').click(function(){ do something});
[05:47:12] <gener1c> is there a way to see what element is under $(this) ?
[05:47:48] <Cork> gener1c: you mean child elements?
[05:47:52] <Aple> Hey guys. I'm sorry to bother you with a newb question, but I haven't messed with jQuery in a while and I'm not sure why this animate function isn't responding: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/395541/
[05:48:01] <Whirl3d> djQuery, but how do I tell if someone click outside of  the annoying panel, say in$("#opinionatedOtherspace")
[05:48:02] <djQuery> gener1c: you mean visual lower on the page than the current element? Not realy.
[05:48:03] <gener1c> no Cork siblings
[05:48:10] <Techdeck> Whirl3d, either add an overlay div that will be in the background while it flies up, or, you can listen to the event of click even on 'body', and then see if e.target is NOT the id of your flying panel
[05:48:23] <Cork> gener1c: .nextAll or just .next
[05:48:42] <Aple> Basically I have an unordered list with a ul inside of each li. I'm trying to get the ul inside to animate out (slide) to the right and contract when they hover off.
[05:48:46] <gener1c> lets say i have 5X5 div matrix
[05:48:47] <djQuery> Whirl3d: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[05:48:52] <gener1c> i am on div 3
[05:49:05] <gener1c> the one under it would be 8
[05:49:15] <Cork> gener1c: ah, no there isn't
[05:49:20] <Whirl3d> Techdeck, djQuery, thanks for the replies.
[05:49:43] <gener1c> i am thinking about using offset() and counting how much divs i have in a line
[05:49:44] <Cork> gener1c: dom doesn't care about where its physically positioned
[05:49:59] <gener1c> then just moving the proper amount of divs using .next
[05:50:06] <djQuery> gener1c: what are the ids of the divs like?
[05:50:22] <gener1c> i can give them ids but i think that would be redundant
[05:50:45] <gener1c> and this thing should be dynamic so ids wont help
[05:51:16] <djQuery> if it is 5X5 $(this).sibbligs('nth(5th)') will work except for the last row wont it
[05:51:38] <djQuery> sorry nth(5)
[05:51:50] <gener1c> nth-of-type == nth ?
[05:52:02] <Cork> gener1c: could work if you give them a fixed width area to work with
[05:52:16] <Cork> gener1c: that way you know how far you have to go to get the next row
[05:52:27] <Cork> but other then that no, theres no way to do it
[05:53:21] <djQuery> gener1  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-obtain-the-nth-jquery-object-in-a-jquery-collection
[05:54:14] <gener1c> cork i solved it :)
[05:54:25] <SkiOne> I need a little debugging help. I am trying to reform an array. When I log the variables I am using I get data I am expecting but when I try to assign values to the array I get an error. Here is the link with error details: http://pastebin.com/0KQFHNNg
[05:54:25] <gener1c> .offset().top would change in the new line
[05:54:30] <gener1c> then you know you finished counting
[05:54:48] <Cork> heh scary
[05:54:51] <SkiOne> the error is from line 16
[05:55:37] <Aple> Anyone know that Paul Irish one-liner that sets <html>'s class to "js"?
[05:56:03] <Aple> nm, found it http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[05:56:37] <safzouf> Hi :)
[05:56:47] <SkiOne> am I not assigning the array correctly? it seems like this should be working
[05:56:51] <safzouf> how ta assess php variables in jquery?
[05:57:01] <safzouf> access
[05:57:21] <safzouf> just use them? (ex: $var)
[05:57:29] <Cork> SkiOne: your not working with an array, but other then that it looks fine
[05:58:01] <djQuery> safzouf: somewhere in your php code you need to output them to the html
[05:58:01] <Cork> SkiOne: oh, wait you never create the second level array
[05:58:05] <mattems> hey all
[05:58:15] <mattems> whast the best way to check if im at the last element?
[05:58:28] <SkiOne> yes its a mutldimensional array where the first level will have only 1 element
[05:58:42] <djQuery> mattems: check what .next() is
[05:58:42] <safzouf> output them to html? :o
[05:58:44] <safzouf> how?
[05:58:51] <Cork> SkiOne: no its a multi dimentionel object, you asign it {}, not []
[05:59:15] <Cork> SkiOne: and you never create a second lever array, so data[0][] won't exist
[05:59:18] <djQuery> safzouf: looks like you need to go ask in /join #php
[05:59:27] <safzouf> okay
[05:59:36] <safzouf> can't post to this channel?
[05:59:45] <mattems> djQuery: i cant do this though if($(this).next()(
[05:59:51] <blackspotwiggins> safzouf, i suggest you look what the last p in php stands for
[06:00:03] <Cork> SkiOne: var data = []; ... data[0] = {}; data[0][label] = value;
[06:00:07] <safzouf> sorry?!
[06:00:18] <djQuery> mattems: if($(this).next().length){
[06:00:23] <mattems> ahhh
[06:00:41] <SkiOne> wow, thanks
[06:01:44] <daxim_> the last p is for "training wheels", amiright?
[06:01:56] <Cork> SkiOne: when you use values you sould use [] and when its keys it should be {}
[06:02:24] <blackspotwiggins> daxim_, almost
[06:02:28] <SkiOne> I am not sure what you mean Cork
[06:02:47] <Cork> SkiOne: and array in js is only numbers 0-9
[06:02:54] <Cork> SkiOne: if you use a string its an object {}
[06:03:24] <Cork> data[0] <-- array data['NO_LABEL'] <-- an object
[06:03:35] <Whirl3d> djQuery, that plugin works great! Thanks.
[06:04:18] <djQuery> Whirl3d: no probs
[06:06:25] <SkiOne> Cork: thanks, my familiarity with JS arrays is not good. I am trying to form a variable that will be compatible with the content here: http://pastebin.com/v6gXYuhR This is data for a chart plugin. I have the data but just cant figure out how to get it into the right format and I am sure it is because I lack the neccessary comprehension for JS arrays. Based on what I saw here it looked like a keyed array but now I don't know
[06:11:01] <thathurts> SkiOne: can you convert that data to a different format?
[06:12:08] <SkiOne> that is the format the plugin is expecting. I am trying to convert the data from one plugin to the format for another. the first plugin gets it data via an ajax call. it then returns the values and I pass it to the second plugin
[06:13:45] <djQuery> SkiOne: couldnt u just do an map on it?
[06:14:02] <SkiOne> sure if I new how
[06:14:24] <SkiOne> if it were php this would not be difficult but JS is different enough to be giving me trouble
[06:16:56] <gheegh> Hey all, quick question.. i'm looking for a plugin that implements a popup similar to the new yahoo mail.. ideally, it is draggable, resizeable, and minimizable.. and when it minimizes, it "docks" itself at the bottom of the browser and can be reopened... anyone seen a plugin that has that similar function? I've seen 2 out of 3, but all 3 would be idea...
[06:18:37] <smarts> hi all
[06:19:06] <smarts> any idea why bUseRendered: false ould not be working and still passing in old CACHED HTML to the custom sort function on a datatable?
[06:19:54] <dahie> hey, I have a question regarding jquery on android. For a project we are executing jquery within an app in the webview module and one my htc legend(android 2.1) it works fine, but on the htc desire (android 2.2) it doesn't. Are there any known compatibilty issues with jquery on android or do you have advise on how to avoid it?
[06:20:38] <thathurts> i can't get jquery ui autocomplete to work. it only shows stuff in the dropdown when the input box is empty and i backspace
[06:20:49] <thathurts> it doesn't show text as i type in values, which is the whole point of autocomplete
[06:22:31] <shucky> hi all
[06:24:09] <shucky> how can i edit the wraper of the jquery autocomplet
[06:24:11] <shucky> ?

[06:27:16] <jamesiarmes> I'm updating from jQuery UI 1.8.4 to 1.8.13 and now it appears that my AJAX tabs are being preloaded. Is there a way to prevent this?
[06:29:29] <Colonel-Rosa> morning query heads

[06:34:38] <clorith> Is it possible to add icons to a button in a jQueryui dialog?
[06:36:05] <vastak> Clonix, Yes. You can do it with CSS.
[06:37:59] <smarts> hi guys,m any thoughts on this ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6138354/jquery-datatable-custom-sort-picking-up-old-html
[06:41:07] <SkiOne> Cork: fyi this is how I ended up having to have to do it: data.push(Array(label,value)); thanks
[06:42:50] <thathurts> i can't get jquery ui autocomplete to work. it only shows stuff in the dropdown when the input box is empty and i backspace

[06:43:59] <AdvoWork> i have jeditable working fine, but im now doing something on the fly(creating a new table row with append()) and im using the same div for the editable bit, but it wont work when I do it this way, any suggestions please?
[06:44:41] <djQuery> clorith: its a pain in the ass but here http://jsfiddle.net/u5Y8a/
[06:45:37] <djQuery> clorith: here this looks a little better $('#test').dialog({buttons:{OK: function(){ $(this).dialog('close');}}}).closest('.ui-dialog').find('.ui-button-text:contains("OK")').parent().button({icons: {primary: 'ui-icon-trash'}});

[06:46:47] <paulatrothbury> smarts: so is the dataTable script firing before your new data is read into the app?
[06:46:56] <ahandy> hi, im using zoomy to add zoom to an image, to start the zoomy the visitor has to click on the image, and when he wants to stop it, he clicks on the image again. how can i stop the zoomy() using something in jquery? like i want to add an X to the image that the visitor can click to stop zoomy
[06:47:29] <smarts> well, the datable is drawn, and then we change some of the rows via JS, and then we run this sorter
[06:47:36] <smarts> paulatrothbury, ^^
[06:47:47] <smarts> so by the time the sorter is run, there is new stuff on the DOM
[06:47:54] <smarts> but Datatable is keeping its own cache
[06:49:06] <paulatrothbury> smarts: Maybe you can wrap the dataTable function in livequery
[06:49:07] <paulatrothbury> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[06:49:20] <paulatrothbury> no idea if that will work mind you
[06:50:18] <SkiOne> you should look into alternative ways of getting data into datatables, that plugin can handle all of this stuff
[06:50:52] <SkiOne> I am doing a project with datatables right now and have read over the docs quite a bit, what you are doing is inherent functionality in the plugin
[06:50:57] <djQuery> smarts: have you looked at this ? http://www.datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/column_render.html
[06:51:05] <SkiOne> ^^^
[06:51:23] <SkiOne> their forums are also really good
[06:52:22] <djQuery> smarts: sounds like you need to use datatables method of manipulating the table rows rendering instead of going outside the box\datatable
[06:54:17] <smarts> djQuery, thanks
[06:54:50] <djQuery> smarts: http://www.datatables.net/examples/plug-ins/dom_sort.html
[06:54:52] <pallet> Are there any jquery freelancers here who are any good at Drag + Drop UI stuff
[06:54:53] <djQuery> as well
[06:55:12] <Phil-Work> pallet, yeh
[06:56:08] <jeffsmykil> is there a way for an integer to display as a two digit value instead of one
[06:56:12] <jeffsmykil> like 01 versus 1
[06:57:12] <qdk> jeffsmykil: check the length, if < 2, prepend a 0.
[06:57:36] <Phil-Work> jeffsmykil, sprintf
[06:57:38] <jeffsmykil> that makes sense
[06:57:42] <jeffsmykil> oh another option
[06:57:44] <jeffsmykil> sprintf?
[06:58:54] <Phil-Work> eh... sorry
[06:58:59] <Phil-Work> this isn't the php channel
[06:59:00] <Phil-Work> haha
[06:59:10] <jeffsmykil> heh
[06:59:35] <Phil-Work> what qdk said ^^
[06:59:43] <jeffsmykil> k
[07:00:14] <Phil-Work> though I'm sure someone has written a sprintf implementation for JS
[07:00:19] <qdk> jeffsmykil: if value < 10, prepend a 0, would also work.
[07:00:19] <veidt> hi. is there a jquery function that can detect a programmatic value change in an input? in my case, a date string that gets inserted from a datepicker
[07:00:29] <qdk> Phil-Work: I think so too.
[07:01:16] <markj> ?change @ veidt
[07:01:51] <markj> poxy bot, http://api.jquery.com/change/
[07:01:52] <veidt> that won't fire in my case
[07:02:29] <pallet> Phil-Work,
[07:02:32] <pallet> can I PM ?
[07:02:46] <markj> when you select a value with a datepicker (jq ui one), you could use the onSelect Event
[07:03:05] <Phil-Work> pallet, sure
[07:05:24] <djQuery> veidt: are you using ui.datepicker? if so there is a callback for when it sets the date. http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#event-onClose
[07:06:00] <jeffsmykil> qdk:  $("#minutes").val().prepend('0')
[07:06:03] <jeffsmykil> like that?
[07:08:53] <qdk> jeffsmykil: more like if ($("#minutes").val() < 10) print '0' + $("#minutes").val()... in JS syntax. ;-)
[07:09:12] <veidt> yeah, we're using the jquery datepicker, but the function that i need to update is sort of a general util method attached to inputs (shows/hides a hint text based on focus/blur), so it would be better if i can detect the value change on the input side
[07:10:44] <djQuery> veidt: $('input[type="date"]').datepicker({onClose: function(){ $(this).trigger('change'); })
[07:11:31] <djQuery> veidt: or rather trigger('blur')
[07:12:15] <Phoenixz> Is there a "getScript()" like method in jQuery to load .css files? I thought getStyle() could do it, but it looks like that is mootools..
[07:12:47] <djQuery> Phoenixz: .load?
[07:13:08] <ip-route> hi

[07:13:53] <ip-route> the background-image not work perfect
[07:13:57] <ip-route> how solve this?
[07:14:10] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[07:14:11] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 8 hours, 13 minutes and 36 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Ping timeout: 250 seconds
[07:20:24] <djQuery> ip-route: put together a http://jsfiddle.net of the issue
[07:23:22] <djQuery> argh I suck at css http://jsfiddle.net/UsLnM/11/
[07:23:46] <djQuery> how to get them all to display one one line?
[07:25:09] <veidt> djQuery, my bad, we're not using the jquery datepicker.
[07:25:42] <djQuery> are u using some other plugin? what method\events does it have?
[07:27:29] <veidt> it's some apache chenillekit datepicker. i could hack something in the middle of that, but like i said before, i was *hoping* there was a way to detect the value change purely on the input side .D
[07:28:12] <djQuery> veidt: you might research onpropertychange but it has some cross browser issues
[07:29:05] <machine86> hi there
[07:33:14] <jexmex> will a binding on a click bind to a element added after page load?
[07:33:29] <djQuery> jexmex: nopers
[07:33:38] <jexmex> how can I make that happen?
[07:33:39] <djQuery> look up .live and .delegate
[07:33:42] <jexmex> ok
[07:33:43] <jexmex> thanks
[07:36:28] <kettle> Does anyone know why alert($("#dpi").offsetHeight); gives me undefined but alert(document.getElementById("dpi").offsetHeight); works fine and gives my 96?
[07:37:03] <veidt> brackets?
[07:37:23] <djQuery> kettle: because they are 2 different objects and one doesnt have a offsetHeight
[07:37:43] <kettle> ok ty
[07:37:49] <kettle> Guess I could use the plain js version
[07:37:52] <kettle> Just looks messier
[07:38:03] <phlp> alert($("#dpi").get(0).offsetHeight);
[07:38:29] <djQuery> kettle: yeah alert always looks messy versus console.log
[07:38:46] <kettle> I didn't mean the alert, just in general.
[07:39:03] <bobodan> Hi how is it possible to change the validation texts in JQuery?
[07:39:11] <kettle> phlp: Thank you :)
[07:40:05] <djQuery> bobodan: your gonna need to put it more in context than that . validation text of an html required\email\number  input? or using some validation plugin
[07:40:05] <phlp> kettle: np $("#dpi").height() works as well
[07:40:50] <kettle> phlp: So it does, ty again :)
[07:41:07] <bobodan> ok ... i used jquery.validate.js and need the required text in german
[07:43:04] <djQuery> bobodan: remember seeing it somewhere on thier site
[07:44:51] <bobodan> I've searched the page but all i find is the messages option. But that is for certain validation like email, name etc. I think.
[07:45:23] <Danielpk> I have a mouseenter function, how i can add a delay to this function?
[07:45:40] <djQuery> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-validate-plugin
[07:45:51] <Danielpk> just execute mouseenter after 500ms
[07:46:12] <luc2> p

[08:45:16] <manattweb> I'll post it there, but do you have any intial thoughts on how to control that top list?

[08:48:36] <ravenzz> ?get @ naomi
[08:48:50] <djQuery> walid
[08:49:06] <djQuery> ravenzz: bot has been dead for a while
[08:49:10] <ravenzz> no bot no party
[08:49:13] <ravenzz> k
[08:49:15] <walid> djQuery: wait let me process this lol. noobie here
[08:49:26] <ravenzz> naomi http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[08:50:10] <djQuery> walid: there may be errors in there as well
[08:50:32] <walid> djQuery: i don't get what you try to do here. and this would go in the html directly, or?
[08:51:18] <djQuery> well u arent giving me much to go on either. u want to preload but u dont know what u want to preload.
[08:51:33] <jeffsmykil> can anyone tell me why when pressing up the number only gets to 8 and then goes back to 1?
[08:51:36] <djQuery> so I am makin it up
[08:51:41] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/uuG9R/
[08:52:00] <naomi> ravenzz: that doesn't append thoguh :(
[08:52:11] <manattweb> djQuery: I've posted it there, but do you have any intial thoughts on how to control that top list?
[08:52:35] <walid> well i'm using drupal, and i can't know the name of the images before i load the page
[08:53:15] <walid> so either i add a javascript wherever the image is used(here as background-image)
[08:53:18] <walid> in the html*
[08:53:28] <walid> djQuery: or i need a more generic method
[08:54:10] <walid> that would get all divs using a background image(in my case .artwork), and load each image one by one
[08:54:13] <phlp> jeffsmykil: parseInt($("#minutes").val(),10);
[08:54:28] <walid> i don't need to save it in a variable or anything, it just needs to be cached
[08:54:36] <walid> www.stephaneblumer.com
[08:54:50] <jeffsmykil> phlp: what does that do?
[08:55:22] <phlp> jeffsmykil: always include the radix https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[08:56:01] <ahandy> hi, question :D if i start a plugin in jquery such as zoomy(), is there any way to stop it when i dont need it anymore?
[08:57:06] <jeffsmykil> phlp still loading thank you
[08:57:29] <ahandy> anyone?
[08:57:32] <djQuery> ahandy: depeends   some plugins based on the ui.widget model have a destroy option $('dialogdiv').dialog('destroy') for example.
[08:57:36] <walid> djQuery: see what i mean?
[08:57:42] <djQuery> noppes
[08:57:49] <djQuery> walid: I have given up
[08:57:55] <walid> :(
[08:57:57] <walid> ;(
[08:58:16] <walid> it's not complicated: check www.stephaneblumer.com
[08:58:18] <ahandy> djQuery: pretty sure there's no ui.widget. thing is, when the zoomy() starts, it has this sort of zoom effect whenever i hover over an image, i want it to stop when i click the a button
[08:58:38] <walid> i need to preload all images, otherwise i lose the animations
[08:58:51] <AdvoWork> if i have loads of table rows, all uniqued by id, ie "table_row_reference_1, table_row_reference_2, table_row_reference_3 etc, how can i cycle the table for all of thoese, so  i know how many ive got like that?
[08:58:54] <djQuery> ahandy: but from the name of it I imagine that it just binds to the click so it may not have all of that.
[08:59:04] <jeffsmykil> ty phlp
[08:59:13] <ahandy> djQuery: yea doesnt like that, so i cant stop it? something like stop() (which doesnt work)
[08:59:15] <djQuery> $('selector').unbind('click');
[08:59:42] <ahandy> that'll keep it running
[08:59:47] <ahandy> on the image that was previously clicked
[08:59:48] <ahandy> no?
[09:00:02] <manattweb> djQuery - Noppes to me?
[09:00:37] <mattp_> hey guys. how would i redirect on a div click to a file download?
[09:00:39] <djQuery> manattweb: well I have no further thoughts on ur issue either at this time.
[09:01:00] <djQuery> manattweb: sometimes stuff just comes to me though so I will keep it open
[09:01:29] <manattweb> djQuery: thanks for your willingness to help - are you the only one in here that looks at this stuff?
[09:01:30] <bigman_randy> how do you make a link on click not go to the link
[09:01:46] <bigman_randy> I'm using .live(click
[09:02:08] <mattp_> bigman_randy: preventdefault or return undefined in the event handler i believe
[09:02:11] <mattp_> something along those lines
[09:02:12] <bigman_randy> I want things to happen but I don't want it to load the linll
[09:02:15] <djQuery> bigman_randy: $('a').live('click', function(e){  e.preventDefault();});
[09:02:20] <bigman_randy> thanks
[09:02:40] <bigman_randy> I knew it was simple just havn't done jquery in about a year
[09:02:48] <bigman_randy> I'm having so much trouble
[09:03:12] <phlp> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false
[09:04:39] <bigman_randy> I think that's how I was taught to do it
[09:04:45] <bigman_randy> the return false method
[09:04:49] <bigman_randy> it doesn't work now anyway
[09:06:25] <RTPMatt> i totally disagree with that post, if you understand what you are doing, return false is a fine tool
[09:07:11] <RTPMatt> ...i suppose knowing what you are doing is a lot of times a problem
[09:08:39] <bigman_randy> I would also venture to guess I don't know what I'm doing
[09:09:27] <RTPMatt> fair
[09:12:09] <djQuery> manattweb: well sometimes people have actual jobs to do.
[09:12:22] <djQuery> manattweb: me on the other hand is unemployed.
[09:12:52] <djQuery> manattweb: I think I have it fingered out but dont have time right now to put together a sample
[09:13:41] <djQuery> manattweb: but basicaly dont use a connected sortable. make each one sortable independently. also make each one droppable independently.
[09:14:12] <djQuery> hove the droppable only accepts li's from the other ul
[09:14:43] <rworth> manattweb: sorry I'm just joining, do you have a sample page showing the problem?
[09:14:47] <toot> hey folks - anyone know about differences in the cursor hotspot on different browsers? seems FF obeys the hotspot set in the .cur, but Chrome/Safari ignore?
[09:15:06] <djQuery> then you can bind to droppables drop grab the element and append it to the ul
[09:15:23] <naomi> can i do jquery lookups on a string of html? e.g., $("img", "<a><img .../></a>")
[09:16:45] <rworth> naomi: use $("<a><img .../></a>").find("img")
[09:16:49] <manattweb> rworth: http://jsfiddle.net/manattweb/YbndA/20/
[09:16:50] <djQuery> naomi: no you need to make it a jquery object first $("<a><img .../></a>").find("img")
[09:17:06] <naomi> thanks, gents
[09:17:11] <rworth> notice http://api.jquery.com/jQuery#jQuery1 specifies context can be of type DOM Element, document, or jQuery
[09:17:27] <jwmann> Hey guys, I'm wondering if there's a way to replicate an 'onclick' function being called but for another function through jQuery
[09:17:43] <jwmann> but for another element*
[09:18:42] <djQuery> jwmann: lookup .trigger
[09:19:12] <jwmann> kk
[09:23:02] <bigman_randy> is there an easy way to add and remove ID's like there is for classes
[09:23:34] <rworth> manattweb: I'm looking into it, give me a bit
[09:23:58] <djQuery> bigman_randy: not cross browser supported $('#testes').removeAttr('id');   but different browser will not like this
[09:24:11] <manattweb> rworth: thanks - do you see what I'm needing?
[09:24:14] <bigman_randy> grr
[09:24:15] <jeffsmykil> whats the command to keep elements from doing their default action?
[09:24:15] <bigman_randy> ok
[09:24:35] <djQuery> .preventDefault
[09:24:36] <rworth> bigman_randy: just give it a new id $(selector).attr("id", "newId")
[09:24:39] <jeffsmykil> thank you
[09:24:48] <rworth> manattweb: yup, debugging
[09:24:56] <jeffsmykil> ty djQuery
[09:24:56] <djQuery> rworth: think those same browsers hate that even more
[09:25:15] <bigman_randy> rwotrth, but is it easy then to also remove that specific id?
[09:25:43] <rworth> djQuery: different than $(selector)[0].id = "newId" ?
[09:26:27] <djQuery> rworth: dont think it matters how u do it. I believe crap 6 err I mean ie6 hates that shiat
[09:26:45] <djQuery> maybe crap7 as well
[09:26:58] <djQuery> forget but I remember running into issues with renaming
[09:27:06] <bigman_randy> oh, well should we even be supporting "crap6" anymore?
[09:27:14] <djQuery> or reid'ing
[09:27:40] <djQuery> bigman_randy: http://saveie6.com
[09:28:09] <bigman_randy> no wonder it won't go away. I don't support that cause
[09:28:27] <manattweb> rworth: i think I just got the answer on stack overvflow - updated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/manattweb/YbndA/21/
[09:28:31] <timholum1> is there a way to have $.ajax return a value? I am querying an xml document and would like a variable returned to the function that is calling it
[09:28:45] <djQuery> bigman_randy: click on the download link its funny
[09:29:06] <rworth> manattweb: that's showing the same for me
[09:29:12] <manattweb> rworth: see any problem with using the receive option?
[09:29:50] <manattweb> when you let go, the new one is sent to the end now
[09:29:55] <snover> ?ajax101 @ timholum1
[09:29:55] <bot-t> timholum1, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[09:30:07] <bigman_randy> that's pretty funny
[09:30:53] <bigman_randy> I'm assuming the questions never end
[09:33:40] <timholum1> snover: Is there a different call ( maybe not .ajax ) that will allow me to query an xml document and get the variable?
[09:34:37] <snover> timholum1: you need to change your thinking from a procedural mindset to an event-based mindset
[09:34:48] <manattweb> rworth: do you see the updated version? If so, do you see any problem using the receive option to apend the new element to the end of the UL?
[09:39:57] <rworth> manattweb: here's a hack, but it works
[09:39:58] <rworth> jQuery.ui.sortable.prototype._getDragVerticalDirection = function () { return "down"; }
[09:41:05] <rworth> manattweb: this looks like a bug but I highly doubt it would get prioritized as this interaction (along with all others) is slated for rewrite, so I'd recommend the hack
[09:44:16] <DanAKAHollywood> Does anyone know of a stellar plugin I can use to display a loading message while my page is loading?
[09:44:37] <manattweb> rworth: thanks for your help - looks like the receive option combined with an appendTo in the sortable definition works too.
[09:45:40] <DanAKAHollywood> When I load the editor on my site it has to open a document and style it for display on the page. This can take a bit for large documents and I want to be able to display a throbber, much like iwork.com does.
[09:48:49] <paulatrothbury1> DanAKAHollywood: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/throbber perhaps?
[09:52:27] <dios> Hey, just started using jquery, i hope someone can help me with : http://jsfiddle.net/fY8Bk/     - The divs are dragging fine, but containment isnt working, the divs can break out of the window and make scrollers
[09:52:31] <dios> Any idea
[09:54:16] <DanAKAHollywood> paulatrothbury1: Looks promising, thanks much. I've done some searches but apparently, I'm less than awesome at finding plugins.
[09:55:17] <paulatrothbury1> DanAKAHollywood: No worries. This thread might help as well. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/750358/with-jquery-how-can-i-implement-a-page-loading-animation
[10:06:00] <dios> Ive updated the fiddle with css and html, http://jsfiddle.net/fY8Bk/2/   can anyone tell me why the containment isnt working? , draggable seems to be doing fine though
[10:09:40] <phlp> dios: ui wasnt included? http://jsfiddle.net/fY8Bk/4/
[10:10:16] <dios> Can i just include the google jquery UI api?
[10:10:19] <dios> in the header?
[10:10:24] <dios> of html?
[10:10:51] <phlp> click manage resources and add it there. i added it to that link and the containment works fine
[10:11:50] <dios> Thanks
[10:16:36] <Primer> I'm trying to load binary data from $.ajax. It seems that a hack is required, namely overrideMimeType. Is this achieved via the scriptCharset option to $.ajax? Just looking for an example
[10:18:30] <snover> Primer: i hope you aren’t trying to do anything that is cross-browser compatible.
[10:18:37] <Primer> no
[10:18:53] <Primer> this is strictly for a test suite that I myself use, in firefox
[10:19:00] <snover> scriptCharset has nothing to do with ajax
[10:19:11] <Primer> it's part of the $.ajax docs...
[10:19:22] <snover> it is used for jsonp type script injection only
[10:19:30] <Primer> ok
[10:19:39] <dios> phlp, i can see your right, the code is working as it should, do when its on my host, the containment isnt working, im using the exact same javascript, any chance i could make you look at it?
[10:19:53] <dios> *do=though
[10:20:43] <phlp> could be the versions that jsfiddle is using the latest
[10:20:59] <dios> Could it be the google jquery ui api that does not support containment
[10:21:01] <dios> ?
[10:21:30] <phlp> no that is what i added to jsfiddle https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.13/jquery-ui.min.js
[10:21:48] <ericindc> I am trying to create a list of images from JSON that when clicked, call a function that sets a couple of hidden fields.  What is the best way to store the data in a bind so that it can be referenced later?
[10:22:20] <dios> Hmm
[10:22:25] <dios> Could i pm you the url?
[10:22:42] <phlp> sure
[10:23:50] <naomi> how to get a query param out of the request string using jQuery? my string is search?q=foo+bar, i want to set my_var to url_unencoded version of GET var "q".
[10:23:59] <naomi> e.g., my_var should be set to "foo bar"
[10:27:31] <Guest45219> iam trying to use both sideup/slidedown effect on ul childs (li). Only slideUp is working. Someone has an idea why ?
[10:28:52] <blindMoe> Guest45219: can you paste the code you are using into jsfiddle.net?  ( both the html and JS )
[10:30:11] <djQuery> Guest45219: have you tried toggleSlide?
[10:30:28] <Guest45219> ok its my fault. SlideDown is to make something appear
[10:30:48] <Guest45219> i would like the li disapear sliding to the bottom
[10:31:27] <djQuery> Guest45219: u can do that with toggleSlide('down');
[10:31:48] <djQuery> sorry slideToggle
[10:32:37] <Guest45219> [object Object] has no method 'toggleSlide'
[10:32:50] <Guest45219> slideToggle :P
[10:34:09] <djQuery> Guest45219: there is also this http://jqueryui.com/demos/toggle/
[10:34:43] <Guest45219> do you see the blind effect ? I have like this one, but in the other way
[10:34:51] <Guest45219> disapear from top to bottom
[10:38:05] <shiftins> gs
[10:39:42] <obrienmd> Having a problem w/ jquery and html drag/drop... I have 2 divs, one directly on top of the other. I have handlers for 'dragover' and 'dragleave' on the bottom div - 'dragover' handler uses jquery to add a class to the top div, and 'dragleave' uses jquery to remove a class from the top div. However, when I drag over it, the class is rapidly added and removed from the top div, resulting in flickering. Is there something I'm clearly do
[10:39:51] <t4nkd> hey jQ -- is it possible to select an element with a NOT statement? Something like "select all images where class is NOT foo"? $('.main img!.foo')
[10:40:19] <phlp> $('.main img:not(.foo)')
[10:40:28] <t4nkd> awesome tyty
[10:40:35] <Guest45219> is it possible to set the direction when using slideUp ?
[10:41:00] <MistuhKurtz> is it more efficient to use a :not selector? or $('.someItems').not('.thisItem') ?
[10:41:31] <phlp> http://jsperf.com
[10:41:35] <t4nkd> I think running functions concurrently would cause another COUNT query?
[10:41:45] <ajpiano> MistuhKurtz, the latter is faster, i believe.
[10:42:09] <MistuhKurtz> oh cool, 'cause that's the way i've been doing it :D
[10:42:10] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[10:42:20] <panfist> i'm trying to create a new window and add something to it and it doesn't seem to be working as expected,
[10:43:06] <panfist> i'm doing var foo = window.open(url, name);, jQuery(foo.document).ready(function() { jQuery(foo.document).append(bar); });
[10:43:17] <phlp> you're in luck one already exists http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not
[10:43:31] <panfist> but bar does not seem to be added to foo...
[10:44:11] <ajpiano> panfist, is the window on the same domain?
[10:44:15] <panfist> yes
[10:44:39] <MistuhKurtz> damn, so the :selector is faster
[10:45:13] <panfist> i can add other things to it later in my script, it just seems not right away...even though i am using $(document).ready() on it
[10:45:47] <JSBracher> Hello, I have a very dumb question: variables within functions are invisible outside that function, if I declare a global variable, it's globally visible.  So I declare "var arrayChosenConditions ;" outside of a function, then set the value in one function, but later in another function, it's undefined.
[10:45:54] <ajpiano> MistuhKurtz: i'm not really sold on that test as the best metric in the world
[10:47:55] <ch3mical> Is there a way to generate an element and pass it to a replace statement at the same time? I'm trying var text = text.replace(/regex/,$('<a/>',{ href: somevar })); but I'm getting an object, not the element...
[10:49:44] <cm> how come calling the focus() method on something doesn't actually focus it properly?
[10:49:54] <cm> In this case, I'm trying to focus a text box
[10:50:03] <cm> and it is highlighted, but the cursor isn't in it
[10:50:18] <nessup> Hi. I'm trying to set the value of a key with "this.find('img').attr('alt')" in a JSON definiton
[10:50:26] <nessup> is there any reason that it wouldn't work?
[10:50:42] <djQuery> damn dont you hate it when you have an idea so big it makes ur head hurt
[10:50:58] <pirolab> hi all
[10:51:02] <djQuery> snyapses firing all at once
[10:51:56] <cm> http://jsfiddle.net/xj9sZ/
[10:52:17] <shiftins> are there any patterns documented anywhere for boostrapping a plugin by checking for jquery, loading the script, and then creating the jquery plugin?
[10:52:53] <gnarf> shiftins: huh?
[10:53:13] <pirolab> cm what is your goal? to highligth the textarea?
[10:53:19] <pirolab> or what?
[10:53:21] <cm> Yes
[10:53:32] <Jayflux> it highlights but he wants the curser in it blinking
[10:53:32] <cm> To prevent the user from blurring it, basically
[10:53:41] <pirolab> ok
[10:53:49] <natrixnatrix89> Could anyone please suggest me a way to detect if user agent is mobile(iPhone/iPod touch/Android/iPad) using jquery?
[10:53:54] <cm> So that if the user types, it always ends up in there and they don't have to click into it
[10:54:09] <Jayflux> seems to work for me cm
[10:54:17] <Jayflux> oh wait i see
[10:54:32] <pirolab> no doesn't
[10:54:54] <Jayflux> yeah i know it doesnt now pirolab
[10:55:10] <pirolab> let me think
[10:55:21] <cm> I don't want to track every keypress and add it manually, cos that isn't usual behavior of a browser
[10:55:40] <pirolab> yea right
[10:55:54] <pirolab> make a mess
[10:56:42] <naomi> how can i find an a tag based on a data- attribute? $('a[data-foo="hello world"]'); ?
[10:56:52] <naomi> is this recommended?
[10:58:32] <ch3mical> naomi: that should work
[10:58:44] <ch3mical> naomi: also see ?attr
[10:58:45] <bot-t> naomi, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[10:58:54] <ch3mical> maybe see ?prop
[10:58:55] <bot-t> ch3mical, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[10:59:01] <naomi> ch3mical: ....
[10:59:14] <naomi> these are completely unrelated to my question
[10:59:16] <ch3mical> Prop is probably not what you want
[10:59:39] <ch3mical> You asked how you can find a tag... that's how
[10:59:44] <naomi> i want to find an element based on a data attribute value.
[10:59:49] <ch3mical> That's how
[10:59:58] <ch3mical> That would return the element
[11:00:12] <ch3mical> Leave out "a" if you're not looking specifically for an anchor element
[11:00:27] <naomi> attr() and prop() do not find elements...
[11:00:43] <tmayr> ch3mical: they return the value of, not the element
[11:01:07] <ch3mical> I gave those as additional info, my ANSWER was that naomi's selector should work
[11:01:19] <ch3mical> Christ
[11:01:36] <naomi> ch3mical: but now your credibility is called into question because your additional infos have nothing to do with solving my problem..
[11:01:40] <tmayr> oops, i didnt read above
[11:01:40] <tmayr> x)
[11:01:46] <naomi> i'm not trying to yell at you, but those don't help me at all..
[11:01:56] <ch3mical> My credibility?
[11:02:07] <ch3mical> That's a laugh
[11:02:15] <naomi> yes. i am doubting that this is the most efficient way to find an element by data attribute
[11:02:20] <Jayflux> cm im not sure if it can be done in jquery alone you may need some js
[11:02:24] <naomi> you say "it should work" then give me unrelated infos
[11:02:40] <ch3mical> I didn't say you find the element with attr, did I?
[11:02:43] <naomi> i'm just saying that's not a very solid answer
[11:02:44] <tmayr> he gave you complementary info, that you might find useful, thats all
[11:02:52] <shiftins> gnarf: i'm thinking to include a jquery plugin on a page, but I would like to make sure jquery is present, and load it if not, and then boostrap the plugin
[11:02:55] <pirolab> cm I'm trying but nothing to do
[11:03:13] <pirolab> the blur event doesn't work
[11:03:28] <wilto> Naomi: You were correct—$('a[data-foo="bar"]') will give you an element with the exact value of "bar."
[11:03:43] <naomi> ok
[11:04:02] <ch3mical> I guess I didn't spell it out enough for you, lol
[11:04:09] <naomi> wilto: why do i sometimes see selectors like img[@src='foo']? what is the @ for?
[11:04:11] <naomi> is that an old thing?
[11:04:40] <gnarf> shiftins: make your entire plugin a function, and if (window.jQuery) { plugin(); } else { --- create a script tag and set the load event to execute the plugin?
[11:04:46] <gnarf> but really, that just sounds bad
[11:04:55] <gnarf> you might be better off with something like see ?yepnope
[11:04:55] <bot-t> yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[11:04:56] <ch3mical> Makes me wonder why I bother
[11:04:57] <wilto> That's an XPath-style selector.
[11:05:08] <shiftins> gnarf: thanks
[11:05:25] <tmayr> ch3mical: you're awesome, we must misread what you said :p
[11:05:28] <wilto> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ is the gospel for CSS-style selectors.
[11:05:36] <ch3mical> T_T
[11:14:33] <levifig> so, I got a replace() with a regex rule and it works BUT…
[11:14:40] <levifig> it doesn't change the text in the page :S
[11:16:52] <ohcibi> i do a getJSON to an url, which gets properly loaded (can see data in chrome dev-tools, but the success function is not fired... whats wrong?
[11:16:53] <jaequery> probably not the appropriate channel but here goes ... let's say you have a google adsense account, now can I just add this google adsense banner code on unlimited number of domains i have ? or is it just tied per domain?
[11:17:42] <cooki3s> yeah u can put the same adsense code on many websites
[11:18:53] <doktorj> hi - i have alot of div id's named like: #userPage-1  #userPage-2 #userPage-3 etc.. and i'm wondering how i can create a selector that selects all of them...  something like #userPage*  ?
[11:19:15] <jaequery> thats awesome
[11:19:58] <phlp> doktorj: class="userPage"
[11:20:55] <doktorj> phlp: right, shoulda thought of that thanx
[11:23:00] <natrixnatrix89> Could anyone please suggest me how can i detect the absence of mouse using js?
[11:23:08] <natrixnatrix89> i mean for example like ipad or iphone
[11:23:14] <natrixnatrix89> they dont have mouse
[11:23:17] <BillCriswell> doktorj: If you can't alter the HTML you can do [id^=userPage] as well... Hopefully you can alter the HTML though.
[11:23:39] <doktorj> all good, selecting the class did it for me - thanx tho
[11:23:41] <mweltin> If I use .click(callBack) and then call it later .click(secondCallBack) it seems like both callbacks are being called.
[11:23:52] <mweltin> how do I "release" the first one?
[11:23:56] <cooki3s> hello, i am a beginner at jquery and just have a quick question. my little snippet isnt working and im wondering if theres a syntax error with it? http://pastebin.com/Zx2iHETk i never get the alert(); when I click the anchor tag with .topmenubar class
[11:24:08] <mweltin> is there a .click() to clear it or something?
[11:24:30] <phlp> mweltin: .unbind('click')
[11:24:52] <mweltin> phlp++ thanks
[11:25:19] <BillCriswell> cooki3s: Do you have jQuery loaded?
[11:25:43] <nirvisual> wait 1000
[11:26:08] <BillCriswell> cooki3s: Have you tried opening up the console to see i there's any JavaScript errors?
[11:26:13] <cooki3s> BillCriswell: yep! I am coding jquery in a greasemonkey script, but everything works inside the $(document).ready(function(){ like alerts and stuff
[11:26:25] <cooki3s> the firebug console?
[11:26:48] <cm> ...it's very difficult to scroll back in irssi :(
[11:26:56] <SkiOne> can anyone suggest a plugin that adds print and pdf for a dynamically generated page? it has chart and table elements
[11:26:56] <BillCriswell> cooki3s: Yes.
[11:26:56] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: which firefox version?
[11:27:19] <cooki3s> 4.0.1
[11:27:24] <BillCriswell> cooki3s: Remove the space after function
[11:28:08] <BillCriswell> Wait, that's not it haha.
[11:28:13] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: do you access jQuery via unsafeWindow?
[11:28:16] <cooki3s> I actually recieved lots of greasemonkey.js errors
[11:28:24] <cooki3s> but nothing else
[11:29:29] <BillCriswell> Are you sure there's an element with a class of topmenubar on the page?
[11:29:42] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[11:29:46] <Kambfhase> ho
[11:29:54] <cooki3s> yes, i have tried switching to another selector and then it doesnt work either
[11:30:25] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: do you access jQuery via unsafeWindow?
[11:30:36] <BillCriswell> It has to be something strange... Do you have like.. <script type="text/css"> ... </script> or something like that... I did this the other day and it took me like 20 minutes to notice haha.
[11:30:37] <Kambfhase> you should, btw
[11:30:43] <cooki3s> sorry kambfhase i missed answering that. i have no idea what unsafewindow is
[11:31:04] <Kambfhase> oh, ok.
[11:31:32] <Kambfhase> at the top of your greasmonkey script do var $= unsafeWindow.jQuery;
[11:31:37] <cooki3s> nah i have no script tags
[11:32:11] <cooki3s> ok is that all Kampfhase?
[11:32:18] <Kambfhase> is the jQuery loded by the page or do you include it in the ggreasemonkey script?
[11:32:30] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: for now.
[11:32:58] <Kambfhase> making jQ work from Greasemonkey is not that easy
[11:33:00] <caseybecking> I have to remake a custom boardshorts  flash piece into javascript. How hard would it be to do this in jQuery/javascript http://www.shortomatic.com/index.php/vans
[11:34:19] <phlp> cooki3s: is the page dynamic? did you try .live?
[11:34:39] <cooki3s> Kambfhase ok when I did that, now the rest of my greasemonkey script doesn't do anything
[11:34:41] <Kambfhase> .live is even more likely to fail
[11:34:55] <cooki3s> phlp what is that? big newbie to jquery :p
[11:35:42] <phlp> cooki3s: the element has to be on the page before your code runs.. try alert($(".topmenubar").length) there instead
[11:38:36] <Kambfhase> is the jQuery loded by the page or do you include it in the greasemonkey script?
[11:38:42] <cooki3s> phlp ok when I did that, it gave me boxes of 1, 0, 1, 0 in 4 separate alerts
[11:39:02] <bigman_randy> so with jquery I can add an image link into an empty div right?
[11:39:05] <cooki3s> I think the page has jquery itself but I am also including it in the greasemonkey script with @require
[11:39:12] <bigman_randy> or any string for that matte
[11:39:13] <bigman_randy> r
[11:39:30] <Kambfhase> see, thats the problem, your require is fucked up.
[11:39:54] <Kambfhase> do you require from gooogle cdn or something?
[11:40:05] <cooki3s> yep https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.2/jquery.min.js
[11:40:48] <Kambfhase> yeah, that wont work
[11:41:39] <Kambfhase> you need to create your own jQuery version where you replace the window at the very end with unsafeWindow
[11:42:07] <Kambfhase> .. or use the jQuery of the page you are thrying to modify
[11:42:52] <cooki3s> hmm ok, guess my sources was bad then, how would i do that?
[11:43:04] <KayT3> http://pastebin.com/hFNN4qFj when I wrap code with that what exactly happening with the scoping
[11:43:42] <yekta> I just asked this in the javascript room but now on second thought it makes more sense in the jQuery room.
[11:43:43] <yekta> Could someone help me get this to work in Chrome or give me some direction.  http://jsfiddle.net/dwickwire/S9EKN/  Notice the bottom input fields mapped characters work normally in FF but not in Chrome.
[11:43:47] <alexparker> Greetings!
[11:44:32] <Kambfhase> you download the jQuery min file, modify it like i said, and upload it somewhere your users can see it.
[11:44:58] <Kambfhase> or is you are the lone user you can even try modifying the jQuery file on your hardrive
[11:45:23] <cooki3s> what do you mean modify it? should I put my greasemonkey script into the jquery.min.js file?
[11:45:28] <Musok> hey people
[11:46:14] <Musok> people... why doesn't this work http://pastebin.com/84UAu7gc ?
[11:46:15] <Kambfhase> replace the window at the very end with unsafeWindow
[11:46:35] <Musok> its even messing with my other function
[11:46:41] <queuetip> how can i sort an associative array of numbers? for example, var myarray['age'] = 6; myarray['siomething_else'] = 4; how can i sort that? the default array.sort fails to work because when it's associative it thinks my array is an object
[11:46:49] <Kambfhase> Musok: omit the first ; on the last line
[11:47:00] <systemfault> queuetip: You just can't.
[11:47:04] <phlp> Musok: {'left': $(window).width()}
[11:47:06] <Kambfhase> queuetip: you cannot sort an associative array.
[11:47:20] <queuetip> Kambfhase: why? it seems like every other language has that solved already : (
[11:47:29] <Cork[home]> cause there is no such thing
[11:47:38] <Cork[home]> if it has string keys; its an object
[11:47:40] <systemfault> queuetip: In fact, JS doesn't have associative arrays, we just use objects to emulate them.
[11:47:44] <Musok> phlp: whats wrong with that?
[11:47:50] <Kambfhase> its not an arry it is an object. and object keys do not have an order
[11:47:53] <queuetip> okay so how can i sort an object filled with numeric values?
[11:47:58] <phlp> Musok: nothing but your code uses , when it should be :
[11:48:10] <systemfault> queuetip: You can't.
[11:48:18] <Musok> oooh
[11:48:18] <systemfault> queuetip: You can sort an array of numbers though.
[11:48:31] <Musok> still not working though
[11:48:35] <queuetip> systemfault: i know that, i just don't see why you can't sort the values of an object
[11:48:43] <cooki3s> kambfhase thanks but i have no idea how to do what you're talking about :P
[11:48:43] <Jayflux> you can't 'sort' an object
[11:48:49] <systemfault> queuetip: Because it doesn't make sense...
[11:48:49] <phlp> queuetip: you can send sort a function and determine the order yourself
[11:48:50] <cooki3s> and thanks rest too
[11:49:01] <systemfault> queuetip: Do you sort the members of your classes in PHP?
[11:49:14] <Cork[home]> queuetip: you can, you create a small function that loop over the object and created a new sorted object, and returns that
[11:49:19] <queuetip> systemfault: that's not the point, php has associative arrays which you can sort
[11:49:21] <Kambfhase> ok, hmmmm. how do i explain...
[11:49:31] <systemfault> queuetip: But JS doesn't.
[11:49:40] <systemfault> queuetip: Being angry won't change that fact..
[11:49:52] <queuetip> i'm not angry : P
[11:50:06] <systemfault> queuetip: I think it sucks.. but heh..
[11:50:17] <gavacho> u mad bro?
[11:50:26] <systemfault> Y U MAD?
[11:51:02] <bigman_randy> is there a reason this doesn't work? http://pastie.org/1977476
[11:51:11] <bigman_randy> super simple I'd think
[11:52:50] <pifantastic_> bigman_randy: are you sure your selector is matching/
[11:53:42] <pifantastic_> bigman_randy: http://jsfiddle.net/G5BDU/
[11:54:05] <queuetip> Cork[home]: thanks, I found some code that does just that, you can sort object values, but yeah, there's nothing built in to do it :P
[11:54:12] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: http://pastebin.com/YxSv4jPR << this is your new user script file.
[11:54:35] <Kambfhase> update the header and put your logic at the very bottom
[11:55:35] <Musok> final line of my anim: $('#boxes').css({'opacity': 0}).delay(1000).animate({opacity: 1}, 1000);
[11:55:40] <Musok> now its working :) thanks
[11:57:06] <cooki3s> kambfhase wow ok thx, i guess i need to remove the @require. I am also using cookie jquery library, will I need to put this in the greasemonkey script file aswell somehow?
[11:57:42] <Kambfhase> yep, put the whole cookie code below the line, also remove the require
[11:58:08] <cooki3s> below the @require line?
[11:59:07] <levifig> why is replace() showing the right thing in the console but is not replacing the string on the page itself
[11:59:07] <levifig> :S
[11:59:20] <wkmanire> Has anyone tried out sslac?
[11:59:43] <wkmanire> https://github.com/jakobo/sslac
[12:00:30] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: below the === PUT YOUR STUFF HERE === line
[12:02:16] <levifig> anyone?
[12:02:43] <wkmanire> levifig: I'm not sure I understand your question.
[12:03:01] <wkmanire> levifig: Can you provide a jsfiddle with some comments describing what you expect?
[12:03:04] <levifig> so, when I run a jQuery expression on the inspector, it outputs the result I want
[12:03:05] <levifig> sure
[12:03:07] <swiggy> how do i make a selector for an OR statement?... i thought $('input[id^="static"][id^="dynamic"]')  would be an 'OR' selector?
[12:03:09] <swiggy> but it isnt?
[12:03:21] <naomi> how can i implement one of those auto-next-page features. e.g., when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, it auto clicks the "next" button
[12:03:50] <wkmanire> naomi: Check scroll position and then change window.location when appropriate.
[12:04:12] <naomi> wkmanire: how to check scroll position?
[12:04:15] <wkmanire> swiggy: Do you want either or one of them?
[12:04:28] <swiggy> yes
[12:04:34] <wkmanire> naomi: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[12:04:37] <wkmanire> swiggy: Which is it?
[12:04:59] <wkmanire> swiggy: Do you want to retrieve elements that match both selectors or do you want to retrieve elements that match only one or the other?
[12:05:12] <Kambfhase> swiggy: use a comma
[12:05:16] <swiggy> $('input[id^="static"][id^="dynamic"]').filter(':checked').length<1
[12:05:31] <levifig> wkmanire,  http://jsfiddle.net/aPEtr/ < I want the comman and space to be removed from the html
[12:05:31] <swiggy> if a static OR dynamic checkbox IS NOT checked DO
[12:05:44] <levifig> wkmanire, if I put it in the console it outputs the right result in the console
[12:05:53] <levifig> wkmanire,  but doesn't change the html/text :(
[12:06:10] <wkmanire> levifig: Looking
[12:08:19] <wkmanire> levifig: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/aPEtr/2/
[12:08:25] <Kambfhase> swiggy: $('input[id^="static"], input[id^="dynamic"]').not(':checked')
[12:08:29] <wkmanire> $.text() returns the text but does not assign it.
[12:08:49] <wkmanire> levifig: You have to get the text, modify it and then reassign it.
[12:09:00] <levifig> oh
[12:09:12] <wkmanire> immutable strings :D
[12:09:13] <levifig> so do a "search" first, and the "replace"?
[12:09:15] <naomi> wkmanire: which element should i check .scrollTop on?
[12:09:36] <wkmanire> naomi: The window I imagine. Do a little googling/experimenting.
[12:09:39] <wkmanire> I've never implemented that feature myself.
[12:10:07] <wkmanire> levifig: Look at the updated fiddle I sent you.
[12:10:31] <wkmanire> The reason I stored the reference to the li selector is because you don't want to keep calling those jQuery selectors over and over again.
[12:10:41] <wkmanire> Call it once then store a ref then use the reference for your operations.
[12:10:41] <levifig> ohhhh gotcha
[12:11:13] <wkmanire> The "$" prefixed variable name is a sort of unofficial convention that says "I'm a jQuery context"
[12:12:05] <levifig> gotcha
[12:12:08] <levifig> thank you :)
[12:12:14] <wkmanire> No problem.
[12:12:34] <levifig> didn't think about the fact that I had to first "deal with it" and THEN reassign :)
[12:15:17] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: hey I did what you said but ez no work! http://pastebin.com/N93A8Jat
[12:16:44] <ericindc> If I use $('<img />'), I am getting back an object.  How do I then get the actual markup for that object?
[12:19:13] <eddiemonge> ericindc: you are getting back the jquery representation of that object. use [0] or .get(0)
[12:19:34] <ericindc> eddiemonge: okay, thanks
[12:19:56] <eddiemonge> cooki3s !$('<div>').is('div')  ?
[12:21:00] <cooki3s> eddiemonge: what is that?
[12:21:06] <Kambfhase> eddiemonge: thats a hack by me ;)
[12:21:12] <eddiemonge> cooki3s: thats in your code
[12:21:21] <cooki3s> ^
[12:21:28] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: whats it supposed to do?
[12:22:25] <Kambfhase> eddiemonge: have you ever tryed to use jQ .is() from within Greasemonkey in Fx 4?
[12:22:55] <eddiemonge> nope. what happens?
[12:23:25] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: do you get any erros?
[12:24:04] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to build an adaptive layout and I'm wondering if there's any method to like active and deactivate functionality at certain resolutions?
[12:24:43] <BillCriswell> Would my best bet be to detect the width of body onload and apply things as I see fit?
[12:25:07] <Kambfhase> eddiemonge: it fails. if you want to know more: https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues/1300
[12:25:24] <cooki3s> kambfhase: just some from the websites own scripts
[12:25:41] <Kambfhase> BillCriswell: there are mediaqueries for css. you might want to use them
[12:25:46] <cooki3s> but none from my own
[12:25:47] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: what is it you are trying to do?
[12:26:09] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: I'm aware of that for styling. I'm more interested in behavoir.
[12:26:16] <Kambfhase> hmm, debugging gReasmonkey is a pain in the mors
[12:26:59] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: I want an image zoom for the desktop version of the site. When it's on a mobile site I don't really see a way for that to work.. Wondering how to disable that at small sizes.
[12:27:15] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: can you check via GM_log if your script actually runs?
[12:27:42] <josh_k> any guidelines on how much data is too much to be stashing usin $.data?
[12:27:59] <necromancer`brb> can you `return false` in an .each() loop and expect to break out of the loop?
[12:28:31] <phlp> yep
[12:29:16] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: sure I just write GM_log("test") in the file?
[12:29:20] <ch3mical> Does anyone use DataTables?
[12:29:41] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: yeah, at different locations and see how for that JavaScript is executed
[12:30:51] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: thats what i thought. you shouldnt check the screen resolution to detect for mobile because some people could just have their viewport sized small and then resize to make it bigger
[12:32:48] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Thanks!
[12:34:05] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: http://localhostr.com/files/527VcLE/capture.png 2 errors
[12:34:38] <Kambfhase> haha, do what the comment says: unsafeWindow.jQuery
[12:34:47] <Kambfhase> sorry, my mistake
[12:35:21] <cooki3s> how do i do that? same as before? i dont have the code left ><
[12:37:14] <shichuan> hey guys, why jqury dont move bug tracker to github?
[12:37:27] <shichuan> like a one-stop place for jquery dev
[12:37:59] <gnarf> shichuan: because github issues aren't as powerful as the trac is (at least at the moment)
[12:38:07] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: http://pastebin.com/LWSnkKdh
[12:38:36] <shichuan> gnarf: i see
[12:38:49] <shichuan> gnarf: github is open for feedback now
[12:38:56] <shichuan> i submitted a few feedbacks
[12:39:31] <shichuan> gnarf: are u a member of jquery? maybe can submit issues to them, them normally improve
[12:39:59] <eddiemonge> shichuan: we also prefer the having control of the bug system as well
[12:40:27] <eddiemonge> github has too many issues with their issue system. the latest changes they put in actually caused more problems while failing to fix any
[12:40:32] <gnarf> shichuan: there are multiple members of jquery teams here...
[12:40:51] <gnarf> I am on UI & the color plugin atm
[12:41:10] <eddiemonge> oh do i count as being part of the color plugin too?
[12:41:39] <gnarf> eddiemonge: you have one commit in there ;)
[12:41:47] <panfist> sorry for the very basic question, but how do i select an element if i have it's id in the contents of a variable
[12:41:57] <panfist> s/it's/its/
[12:41:57] <gnarf> and like a few props in commit messages for Makefiles
[12:42:12] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: darn, now I get "jQuery is not defined"  "jQuery.cookie = function(name, value, options) {" from the cookie plugin instead, any tips how to fix that one?
[12:42:43] <eddiemonge> panfist: $('#'+variable)
[12:43:00] <panfist> eddiemonge: that's too easy
[12:43:19] <miketaylr> yet it works!
[12:43:38] <eddiemonge> panfist: do you want it to be harder? $(document.getElementById(variable))
[12:43:46] <eddiemonge> ...which is actually faster
[12:43:58] <miketaylr> MAKE IT HARDER
[12:44:07] <panfist> faster is good
[12:45:21] <eddiemonge> function fastID(id) { return $(document.getElementById(id)); }  fast and conside now
[12:46:14] <phlp> $(document.getElementById(('MIKETAYLR-LIKES-IT-HARD-'+variable).split('-')[4]))
[12:46:36] <Kambfhase> ist faster by like 3 instructions

[12:47:17] <Kambfhase> try that one :o
[12:48:27] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: awesome, thank you. now i will work on integrating the click function again :)
[12:48:37] <Kambfhase> it works?
[12:48:50] <cooki3s> the alert() worked now yes
[12:48:56] <Kambfhase> \o/
[12:49:07] <Kambfhase> |o|
[12:49:15] <Kambfhase> ./o/
[12:50:06] <Kambfhase> if got to save the pastee for future reference.
[12:53:39] <cooki3s> should $(".pie").click(function() {  be inside $(document).ready(function(){ or outside?
[12:55:08] <gnarf> cooki3s: depends, do you want it to run immediately, or after the document is ready?
[12:55:21] <gnarf> usually you'd put that in a doc ready
[12:55:31] <gnarf> because you want to make sure the DOM has fully loaded before you search for pie
[12:55:49] <ch3mical> Is it just me, or does developer.mozilla.org default to Japanese?
[12:56:00] <gnarf> but if the <script> is included in the DOM after the .pie you search for, its going to find it anyway
[12:56:09] <MistuhKurtz> lol that's just you ch3mical
[12:56:31] <ch3mical> I can't get it to default to English, I have to change it every time
[12:56:50] <ch3mical> Good thing I took those Japanese classes in college
[12:56:53] <cooki3s> gnarf: ok yeah it doesnt matter to me, I just know it never works lol :p
[12:57:08] <necromancer`brb> ch3mical: why is your ISP in Japan? ;)
[12:57:25] <ch3mical> I wish. That would mean I'm in Japan
[12:57:28] <ch3mical> That would rule

[13:00:47] <eddiemonge> ericindc: add it to the them and then try
[13:01:13] <ericindc> add it?  I'm not sure what you mean.
[13:02:22] <eddiemonge> ericindc: actually, what browser? i tried it in chrome and i ge the html

[13:02:47] <Trisox[work]> hey etiger
[13:02:52] <ericindc> also in chrome.  i'm trying to append it to a string.  is that an issue?
[13:03:10] <ericindc> eddiemonge: https://gist.github.com/98e01417407b3e8c59b7
[13:04:01] <eddiemonge> ericindc: the commented out why you have it is the correct way to do it
[13:05:04] <Trisox[work]> eddiemonge: check my link :>
[13:05:14] <ericindc> eddiemonge: what's with those other functions then?  the commented out way just starts looking messy w/ so many vars.
[13:05:30] <eddiemonge> ericindc: yeah but its a lot faster
[13:06:20] <ericindc> ok, will stick to that then.  thanks.
[13:06:53] <dtach1> i have a row of divs inside a parent div, on click i want to check the number the clicked div is in the row of divs (so 3rd for example) any hints?
[13:07:15] <yekta> How can I get this to scroll to the end of the text input with val(), I'm having a heck of a time.  Any help would be much appreciated. http://jsfiddle.net/dwickwire/S9EKN

[13:09:42] <sac> ah doesn't
[13:09:47] <sac> it doesn't work the way you meant it
[13:10:01] <yekta> yeah, its quite confusing I admit
[13:10:04] <yekta> :-/
[13:10:23] <yekta> the question that is
[13:10:54] <sac> yekta, so the bug is in the caret plugin probably
[13:11:24] <eddiemonge> dtach: again, .index()
[13:11:48] <yekta> sac: hmm, I'll try another
[13:11:51] <dtach> again? :O
[13:12:25] <eddiemonge> dtach: didnt you ask that yesterday?
[13:12:35] <dtach> nope
[13:12:52] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: how would you define a jquery function if not with var light = function ($){ ? function light(){ } i guess? cause I think the $ is causing problems for me, getting some greasemonkey.js errors
[13:13:22] <jeffsmykil> if im getting data back from the web service why would it still kick back the error message?
[13:13:39] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: what do you mean, by jQuery function?
[13:14:10] <cooki3s> hm?
[13:14:28] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: thats a pretty vague question
[13:14:28] <Kambfhase> hm?
[13:14:41] <walkingeyerobot> hm?
[13:14:51] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: it could be the status code, it could be incorrectly formatted data, it could be wrong datatype
[13:15:01] <cooki3s> hm :P
[13:15:01] <keirl> I am using hover to change the opacity of an image from 0.6 to 1, and back to 0.6 on mouseout - can anyone please tell me how i can disable the reset back to 0.6 on click so that it stays as opacity 1 on mouseout when the image is clicked?
[13:15:13] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge how can i make it less vague for you?
[13:15:15] <Kambfhase> i dont get the question.
[13:15:35] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: by providing details.
[13:15:41] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: I send some data, the webservice sends the data back, but i still get the error message instead of the success message
[13:15:52] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: wasn't trying to be rude, sorry if it came across that way
[13:16:08] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: it could be the status code, it could be incorrectly formatted data, it could be wrong datatype
[13:16:26] <phlp> jeffsmykil: what is the error?
[13:16:46] <jeffsmykil> phlp: it is just kicking back my error function
[13:16:49] <keirl> can anyone advise me on mu problem pls?
[13:17:52] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: did you check the things i said?
[13:18:07] <jeffsmykil> i know the datatype is correct
[13:18:12] <jeffsmykil> as is the data formatted
[13:18:16] <phlp> i see.. i thought you meant got the data in success but were getting an error
[13:18:19] <jeffsmykil> not sure what the status code is
[13:18:25] <eddiemonge> keirl: set a flag on click and then check that flag on mouseout
[13:18:38] <jeffsmykil> phlp: no, it is coming through in fiddler
[13:18:39] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: look in firebug
[13:18:50] <jeffsmykil> phlp it is skipping success
[13:19:07] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: do a console.log on the error function to see what jquery is saying
[13:20:59] <jeffsmykil> so just insert console.log(); into the error function?
[13:21:14] <ZeuZ> Hey all. I'm loading a div with the reply from an AJAX query. There, I have a submit button. The code I add to handle the click doesn't work off the bat, but if I paste it in firebug it does, what am I doing wrong?
[13:21:37] <Kambfhase> ZeuZ: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[13:22:16] <eddiemonge> ?ajax.error
[13:22:17] <bot-t> eddiemonge, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

[13:23:46] <ZeuZ> Kambfhase, the div ain't handled like in the example, it's for that div id in particular like: $("#id_of_the_ajax_loaded_button_inside_the_div").click(...)
[13:24:24] <ZeuZ> Ah, nevermind I read the second part..
[13:24:30] <Kambfhase> :)
[13:24:32] <ZeuZ> Since the element is new, it won't get recognized..
[13:24:40] <ZeuZ> However what I don't understand is the workaround...
[13:24:47] <ZeuZ> Can anybody "explain" it to me?
[13:24:53] <ZeuZ> Or link me with something in spanish? hehe
[13:25:00] <jeffsmykil> thank you eddie im trying that now
[13:25:25] <Kambfhase> ZeuZ: use hte live method
[13:25:30] <caseybecking> i have to re-create a site like this http://www.shortomatic.com/index.php/vans only using non flash ityems. Any one havce any recommendations for languages to start with?

[13:26:34] <Cheery> hi jqueer partners.
[13:27:02] <Cheery> I think about making a game but would like a pause when the player has no focus.. oh wait that's simple.
[13:27:12] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: I got a strange error: console is not defined
[13:27:15] <Cheery> $(canvas).focus
[13:27:15] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: that is not a description i can help you with.
[13:27:44] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: get yourself a console!
[13:28:00] <jeffsmykil> ..im running firebug
[13:28:00] <Snerf> is it at all possible with .draggable() to make it not so picky on the movement of the mouse?  at times, just clicking the item moves it a few pixels if I move my mouse slightly. thanks
[13:28:05] <Kambfhase> i recommend X360
[13:28:07] <ZeuZ> Kambfhase, well, I just added the code for it like .live('click',alert("lol")); however now the alert comes up even when the button is not loaded...
[13:28:12] <eddiemonge> caseybecking: html, css, javascript
[13:28:38] <Kambfhase> ZeuZ: .live('click',function(){ alert('rofl') })
[13:28:38] <caseybecking> member:eddiemonge : any frameworks that will work better than others?
[13:28:51] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: have you tried turning it off and then on again?
[13:28:54] <caseybecking> cappuccino, dojo, jquery?
[13:29:10] <cooki3s> Kambfhase: if I make a $("body").click(function() {  it should trigger anytime i click on the whole website frame right?
[13:29:14] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: no, i will toggle it
[13:29:27] <ZeuZ> Kambfhase, thanks, :)
[13:29:48] <Kambfhase> :)
[13:29:49] <eddiemonge> Snerf: delay and/or distance
[13:30:05] <Primer> Anyone know of a way to read binary data and encode it to base64? Seems this plugins I'm finding can only deal with re-encoding text
[13:30:06] <Snerf> eddiemonge, will check it out, thanks
[13:30:06] <cooki3s> woho .click actually worked!
[13:30:07] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: no dice
[13:30:15] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: it should trigger each time you click somehwere and the event bubbles up to the body
[13:31:15] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: i meant the browser and/or computer
[13:31:29] <necromancer> can you compare 2 jQuery objects with "=="?

[13:32:47] <BlackArts> thanks
[13:32:51] <necromancer> wtf
[13:32:55] <necromancer> i turned this fuckin timer off
[13:33:34] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: it wasnt a snide comment. it was actual help. sometimes firebug is screwy and needs a browser restart
[13:33:35] <Kambfhase> $('div')[0] === $('div')[0] @ necromancer
[13:33:45] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: sorry
[13:33:53] <necromancer> thanks Kambfhase
[13:33:54] <eddiemonge> caseybecking: umm yes? im sure they could all do it just fine
[13:34:11] <cooki3s> If I append a div to body, will I be able to use .click on that div, or is it not a part of the DOM then?
[13:34:35] <Kambfhase> cooki3s: it is, right after the append
[13:34:38] <caseybecking> eddiemonge : but you dont have any recommendations?
[13:34:42] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: not necessarily. what if the element isnt the first element?
[13:35:01] <cooki3s> ok, thats ruled out then
[13:35:08] <eddiemonge> caseybecking: lets see, im in a #jquery room, but no. no recommendations on what javascript library to use
[13:35:10] <Kambfhase> eddiemonge: in that case everything gets pretty complicated.
[13:35:18] <janthony> http://oodletech.com/infinit/ - If you click on the "Information" link at the bottom .slideToggle() works great and it shows the element in the dom. However, the user has to scroll down after hitting the "information" link. Any ideas on how to get around this or a way to anchor it down to the bototm so they can see the slide effect and won't have to scroll after clicking the link?
[13:35:28] <eddiemonge> Kambfhase: yup
[13:35:35] <diegoviola> hi, anyone knows a plugin that will do this kind of thing: http://www.flashimap.com/worldview/united_states_selection_form.php
[13:35:38] <eddiemonge>  necromancer why do you want to know that?
[13:35:38] <Kambfhase> :)
[13:35:46] <caseybecking> eddiemonge : Thank you for you time
[13:35:56] <eddiemonge> janthony: scrollTo?
[13:36:31] <necromancer> eddiemonge: i need to iterate through a group of <div>s and find the position of the one with an .active class
[13:36:46] <necromancer> then i need to move a carousel up and down if that .active item is not visible, until it is visible
[13:37:26] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: I'm getting a message in the console on submit but it appears and goes away to fast to read
[13:37:38] <janthony> eddiemonge: I cannot find that in the documentation. I'm assuming that's a plugin?
[13:37:50] <jeffsmykil> ahh persist
[13:38:04] <Kambfhase> necromancer: do you kno .index() ? might be useful here
[13:38:39] <eddiemonge> necromancer: $group.find('.active').index()  or .offset()
[13:38:49] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: in your console?
[13:38:54] <jeffsmykil> crap its an error in jquery

[13:39:31] <Kambfhase> ?remove @ MeltingKeyboard

[13:39:53] <eddiemonge> janthony: i dont know, probably
[13:40:03] <Kambfhase> :)
[13:40:07] <necromancer> eddiemonge: thanks man

[13:40:31] <BlackArts> eddiemonge: yes, I know, but ie render it from some reasone
[13:40:31] <necromancer> eddiemonge: is $group real or should i replace that with $('#my_elements)?
[13:42:33] <eddiemonge> jeffsmykil: do you have a link to your site?
[13:43:01] <eddiemonge> necromancer: replace it
[13:43:05] <jeffsmykil> its all in our svn unfortunately
[13:46:02] <jeffsmykil> eddiemonge: return false; did it
[13:46:21] <eddiemonge> did what?
[13:48:10] <jeffsmykil> made it so the success message popped up
[13:48:49] <jeffsmykil> thanks for the help eddiemonge
[13:49:57] <cooki3s> Can someone explain what makes one of the click functions not work?? http://pastebin.com/pAK4s2rr
[13:51:13] <janthony> I think the .scrollTo() plugin is broke. Keep getting a bunch of console errors.
[13:52:34] <eddiemonge> cooki3s: the a tag doesnt exist yet. you need to put your code right before the body or in a .ready() block
[13:52:48] <eddiemonge> janthony: it might not have been updated to the newest jquery yet
[13:55:04] <janthony> eddiemonge:  I actually didn't need to use the plugin. scrollTop: $(document).height() worked form e.
[13:55:06] <janthony> me*
[13:56:18] <cooki3s> eddiemonge: im just trying to disinclude irrelevant code to my pastebins, the selector doesnt work in a .ready() either
[13:56:50] <eddiemonge> cooki3s: you sure? it should. and use jsfiddle.net. see ? pe
[13:56:51] <bot-t> cooki3s, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.

[14:07:57] <cooki3s> eddiemonge: how would i make a tag exist so i can use a selector on it? right now im document.write("<a class="pie">); and then trying to .click on it, but its not working and im guessing its because it doesnt exist?
[14:07:57] <jamesarosen> also posted to the forums here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/ios-style-menu-demo-on-jquery-1-9
[14:09:02] <bakers> jamesarosen: looks good
[14:09:25] <Cheery> does javascript keydown have a tradition of being bad enough that you can't make worm game over it?
[14:09:40] <eddiemonge> cooki3s: maybe. havent today though
[14:09:47] <solepixel> can someone help me with this easing issue. my hover animation isn't smooth for some reason because it seems like it's trying to ease the animation and I don't want it to: http://dev.infomedia.net/carousel/
[14:09:56] <eddiemonge> ? .prop() @ bakers

[14:10:33] <eddiemonge> Cheery: huh?
[14:10:38] <mattp_> eddiemonge: thanks
[14:10:55] <eddiemonge> bakers: really? i always use keydown since thats when characters are input
[14:11:41] <empireoflight> I'm using jquery cookies plugin and getting duplicate cookies on my site
[14:11:44] <eddiemonge> jamesarosen: i makes for a decent plugin at least
[14:12:24] <empireoflight> the user can change the cookie throughout the site, but the url changes
[14:12:48] <empireoflight> so if the cookie value changes on a sub-directory i get a duplicate cookie
[14:13:00] <empireoflight> is there any way to fix this?
[14:13:43] <eddiemonge> solepixel: its not smooth because it animates 100 pixels, stops, then starts again.
[14:13:57] <jamesarosen> bakers: eddiemonge: thanks
[14:13:59] <Cheery> oh yeah.. jquery doesn't give key presses in order. oh great.
[14:14:04] <solepixel> eddiemonge: i'm at a loss on this thing. what is the trick to making it smooth?
[14:14:16] <eddiemonge> Cheery: what? what do you mean?
[14:14:52] <Cheery> eddiemonge: well I need to look on it a bit still.
[14:14:55] <eddiemonge> modify the plugin to animate continuously while hovering over the arrow i guess
[14:14:59] <cooki3s> empireoflight: if you set path: '/' in the cookie i think it wont create a cookie for each path
[14:14:59] <Cheery> hmm..
[14:15:03] <Cheery> eddiemonge: maybe I'm wrong heer.
[14:15:11] <eddiemonge> Cheery: you are making no sense at all
[14:15:24] <solepixel> eddiemonge: how do i keep it from stopping?
[14:15:27] <Cheery> (and should cache keyboard comms if they clearly show pattern of tight turning)
[14:15:39] <Cheery> eddiemonge: I'm writing a worm game :P
[14:15:43] <eddiemonge> solepixel: no idea. look at the code and figure it out?
[14:16:01] <eddiemonge> Cheery: i still stick by what i said
[14:16:22] <Cheery> eddiemonge: yeah, that happens
[14:16:26] <Cheery> often
[14:16:39] <Prot> question: is there an event system for jquery that can work without elements? I want to be able to bind an arbitrary global event and fire it
[14:16:52] <solepixel> eddiemonge: i think it's easing, when i increase the speed, the easing is very obvious
[14:18:16] <phlp> Prot: $(window).bind('bob', function() { alert('hi'); }); $(window).trigger('bob');
[14:18:31] <Prot> yea figured i'd just bind it to the window doc or body
[14:18:40] <eddiemonge> ?bind @ Prot
[14:18:41] <bot-t> Prot, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[14:18:49] <Kambfhase> Prot: there are Deferreds( + Callbacks in 1.7) + what phlp said
[14:18:49] <Prot> i know about bind
[14:19:00] <cooki3s> eddiemonge: how would you let jquery know about a new element inside the .ready(); ?
[14:19:00] <Prot> oh yeah? that'd be nice
[14:19:38] <Kambfhase> where Callbacks means pub/sub
[14:20:57] <defunct> what's the best way to run a function on an element that was created on the fly. I see live() but it appears to be only for events
[14:22:43] <Kambfhase> defunct: is your element in the dom?
[14:23:05] <defunct> Kambfhase: yes
[14:23:10] <Kambfhase> or, what kind of function do you want to run?
[14:23:27] <Kambfhase> i mean, what not just select and run?
[14:24:00] <defunct> Kambfhase: I'm creating a bunch of text inputs, and of course my callback works on the ones that already exist, but ones that are added to the dom after the fact can't use it
[14:24:22] <defunct> Kambfhase: also, I added it when I create the elements, however then it starts running 3-4 times or or however many elements were addded
[14:25:19] <Kambfhase> ?p @ defunct
[14:25:19] <bot-t> defunct, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[14:26:44] <defunct> Kambfhase: sec...
[14:30:03] <eddiemonge> cooki3s: huh? anything in .ready is fired when the dom is ready
[14:31:01] <cooki3s> eddiemonge: I was creating a element on the fly that wasnt recognized. I fixed it with .live();
[14:31:18] <defunct> Kambfhase: http://fixee.org/paste/7lqydkl/
[14:32:19] <Kambfhase> ok
[14:33:01] <clorith> So I have this fifteen puzzle solver right now, and I'm using draggable and droppable to place the puzzle tiles in a scrambled position on a grid.
[14:33:15] <clorith> My probllem is that once I place them on the grid, half the tiles are made empty when the solver runs
[14:33:23] <clorith> but if I run it without putting them in the grid, it works just fine
[14:33:57] <defunct> Kambfhase: I'm running it twice, so I figure there must be way to run it just once even for newly created dom elements
[14:34:06] <UT2K3> hello guys. How can I prevent Safari showing the erorr "Failed to load resource" when I use abort() to cancel a getJSON-Request?
[14:35:35] <defunct> Kambfhase: actually maybe I will just switch the fields so you can't edit them after and just delete
[14:38:40] <tekhneek> using data as a condition in a selector?
[14:38:53] <tekhneek> like data-id="2" ... $('element:data("2")) ?
[14:39:54] <ch3mical> $('[data-id="2"]')
[14:40:01] <Kambfhase> does auto complete stack? i hpoe not :o
[14:41:11] <ccmonster> so im looking at the jquery menu stuff, and I want a menu style
[14:41:26] <ccmonster> where there is one button they click that causes the menu appear, but not sure with the limited documentation how to do this
[14:41:57] <tekhneek> ch3mical: thanks!
[14:42:16] <clorith> ccmonster: You are msot likely looking for either .toggle or .show and .hide
[14:42:41] <ccmonster> where is some documentation that might better explain whats available. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Menu#method-option doesnt have much
[14:43:47] <ccmonster> and it doesnt do the flyout style for somereason
[14:48:24] <obrienmd> http://jsfiddle.net/vRLJd/2/
[14:48:46] <obrienmd> here is the flickering issue I was talking about earlier... only works on chrome (as designed, it's an internal webapp)
[14:49:12] <obrienmd> but would much appreciate any input on why it flickers like that, alternating between dragover and dragleave
[14:49:48] <Kambfhase> jQ 1.3.2?
[14:50:19] <obrienmd> yeah, it's part of our app framework, unfortunately
[14:50:45] <obrienmd> but it does it on 1.6, too
[14:53:54] <ravenzz> defunct did you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/AcMg6/2/
[14:53:54] <ravenzz> ?
[14:54:00] <UT2K3> hm how am I able to catch the Error "Failed to load resource: cancelled" in Safari when using abort() to cancel nen xhr request
[14:55:30] <Kambfhase> obrienmd: may be start a time on dragover/leave similar to hoverInten
[14:56:33] <obrienmd> Kambfhase: not sure I understand what you're saying, I will research hoverInten though
[14:56:58] <K1ng> pirates of the caribbean 4 sucks :|
[14:57:10] <blindMoe> imagine that ;)
[14:59:18] <ravenzz> i haven't seen the 1st yet
[14:59:21] <ravenzz> lol
[15:03:43] <kevinmonk> I have a function that iterates though each form.changed and submits them with Ajax. I want a callback once all of the Ajax requests have completed. I could use the complete: callback but I don't know how many Ajax requests would be called or which would be the last.
[15:03:48] <kevinmonk> The function is here... http://jsfiddle.net/sGdBr/
[15:04:32] <kevinmonk> Is there a way of creating a callback once the .each loop has completed?
[15:04:34] <execution> PHP: will this match any string ending with .paypal.com or do i have to escape the periods? "/(.paypal.com)$/"
[15:04:38] <execution> oops wrong channel
[15:04:42] <eddiemonge> ?deferreds @ kevinmonk
[15:04:42] <bot-t> kevinmonk, Read this for getting started with deferreds: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[15:04:57] <eddiemonge> execute: escape the periods
[15:05:27] <kevinmonk> oh \. you mean
[15:05:34] <kevinmonk> Will do
[15:06:43] <kevinmonk> eddiemonge: Ty. I shall take a look
[15:31:29] <ch3mical> kevinmonk: see ?ajaxcomplete
[15:31:30] <bot-t> kevinmonk, .ajaxComplete(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[15:31:43] <ch3mical> I believe that fires when all active requests complete
[15:31:46] <BlaDe^> how can I detect a mouse click, anywhere except one particular class?
[15:32:14] <BlaDe^> $(body).click(function(e) { if ($(this).class != 'myClass') { } }); or similar?
[15:33:09] <kevinmonk> ch3mical: ty. I think that what I require is Deferreds.
[15:33:23] <ch3mical> ok
[15:33:23] <kevinmonk> but .ajaxComplete looks like an alternative
[15:34:31] <kevinmonk> BlaDe^: see ?:not
[15:34:32] <bot-t> BlaDe^, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[15:35:32] <BlaDe^> kevinmonk I had: if (!$(e.target).parent.is('#sharePopup')) { -- is that completely off?
[15:35:47] <BlaDe^> in a $('body').click( )
[15:36:08] <kevinmonk> BlaDe^: I'm no jQuery expert but I was looking at something similar myself just now
[15:36:25] <kevinmonk> I wanted to select all form elemets that had changed with the exception of one
[15:36:36] <BlaDe^> i see
[15:36:44] <kevinmonk> so I use $('form.changed').not("#review_form")
[15:39:33] <ch3mical> BlaDe^: I think you might want something like $(document).children('*').andSelf().not('#whatever').click(... ?
[15:40:12] <andymac44> Could anyone shed some light on how I might set a default containment on all dialogs that will be opened? I know it has to involve ui.dialog.prototype.options but I can't quite figure it out
[15:40:24] <solepixel> anyone have any suggestions here on this thread? http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/javascript-15/smoother-scrolling-div-hover-760215.html
[15:40:36] <ch3mical> BlaDe^: Or... $(document).children('*').andSelf().click(...); $('#notme').unbind('click');
[15:40:48] <Reedyseth> marikas !!
[15:40:59] <BlaDe^> ch3mical that's what I want but I want it to check the parent, not the element
[15:41:12] <ch3mical> Oh, I see
[15:41:26] <BlaDe^> .parent.not('#whatever') ?
[15:41:33] <ch3mical> You want the click registered ON the parent?
[15:41:40] <Reedyseth> oWo .....
[15:41:49] <BlaDe^> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/xJzAV/3/
[15:43:00] <Phoenixz> Does javascript have a (expression ? true : false) construct?
[15:43:21] <BlaDe^> Phoenixz ternary, yes
[15:43:24] <kojiro> Phoenixz: yes
[15:44:00] <kojiro> of course literally (expression ? true : false) is equivalent to bool(expression) ;D
[15:44:35] <Phoenixz> BlaDe^: kojiro: Ah, my bad.. Thing is, I tried it and it gave a syntax error, but I messed up wit a bracket.
[15:44:41] <Phoenixz> thanks anyway!
[15:44:43] <michaelt> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(expression)
[15:44:53] <michaelt> sorry, had to
[15:45:55] <ch3mical> BlaDe^: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/xJzAV/13/ Is this what you want?
[15:46:44] <BlaDe^> ch3mical yup, thanks :-)
[15:47:13] <Jax> hello
[15:47:16] <ch3mical> np
[15:48:00] <ch3mical> BlaDe^: I haven't tested it, but that my not work on other elements due to stopImmediatePropagation
[15:48:19] <BlaDe^> ch3mical which ones?
[15:49:05] <ch3mical> Hmm, actually, it seems fine
[15:49:07] <Jax> is it possible to fetch all the <tr> elements following a <th> until the next <th> ?
[15:49:50] <ch3mical> BlaDe^: when there are other elements on the page, I thought it might have problems, but seems to still work fine, as demonstrated here http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/xJzAV/14/
[15:49:53] <kojiro> Jax: not clear enough what you want
[15:50:22] <Jax> well i got a table and some rows are grouped by a parent row. i'm just trying to make a + button so you can hide the rows under that parent or show them
[15:50:28] <Jax> not sure what the best structure would be for that
[15:51:11] <ch3mical> Don't you mean th inside tr? I don't usually see tr inside of th
[15:51:20] <ch3mical> Unless you mean thead, not th
[15:51:32] <kojiro> or nested
[15:51:35] <kojiro> (ugh) ;)
[15:51:38] <Jax> well basically i got some theads and each thead has a tbody
[15:51:44] <kojiro> Jax: wut
[15:51:46] <ch3mical> uhhh
[15:51:48] <Jax> i want to hide the tbody of the correspdonding thead
[15:51:50] <kojiro> Jax: code!
[15:51:54] <Jax> ok sorry. one sec
[15:51:59] <kojiro> Jax: show your code, before my head asplode! ;)
[15:52:00] <ch3mical> ?p @ Jax
[15:52:11] <ch3mical> Damn you, bot
[15:56:44] <KWhat_Work> anyoen built jquery from git ?
[15:57:12] <ch3mical> Not lately
[15:57:23] <Jax> here you go kojiro http://dpaste.org/htiv/
[15:57:30] <kojiro> anyone built git from jquery? >:D
[15:57:37] <KWhat_Work> i keep getting an error with this xmlns garbage and ant contrib
[15:57:38] <Jax> simple table, just want to hide all rows following a row that contains header cells
[15:58:04] <ch3mical> Wow, that table looks like something from the late 90s ;)
[15:58:20] <ch3mical> kojiro: Yep!
[15:58:31] <Jax> it's an example from the w3 site! ;)
[15:58:49] <ch3mical> jax: turn off archive.org! :P
[15:59:18] <Jax> i don't follow
[15:59:27] <ch3mical> FYI capital tags went out with HTML3
[15:59:42] <kojiro> still legal with HTML
[15:59:47] <kojiro> as long as it's not xhtml
[15:59:47] <Jax> yeah i just copy pasted that from w3.org
[15:59:50] <ch3mical> archive.org archives websites chronologically, it was a failed attempt at jokery
[16:00:03] <Jax> i see
[16:00:27] <snover> I GOT IT
[16:00:29] <kojiro> Jax: .nextUntil() I guess
[16:00:36] <Jax> i just need a way to have some "row" control visibility of it's children. but as far as i know there is no terminology for "child" in a table
[16:00:36] <kojiro> Jax: but this is a mess.
[16:00:45] <kojiro> snover: WHAT DID YOU GET?
[16:00:50] <snover> the joke
[16:00:52] <snover> “joke”
[16:01:10] <ch3mical> My almost joke? lol
[16:01:27] <kojiro> ch3mical: yeah, I was lost at the "turn off" part
[16:01:36] <Jax> how do i get the next element of type "x" ?
[16:01:58] <kojiro> "x"
[16:02:24] <kojiro> $("tr>th").nextUntil("tr>th") iirc
[16:02:38] <kojiro> although the tr> part is silly
[16:02:46] <kojiro> $("th").nextUntil("th") iirc
[16:03:29] <kojiro> nope!
[16:04:34] <Jax> what if i have something like this: <a class="test">..</a><br> and am doing something like: $('.test').click(...) how could i get the <br> ?
[16:04:42] <kojiro> Jax: actually, now I think about it, you probably just want to select everything that's a child of the table, and then filter the tr>th elements out
[16:05:10] <Jax> but i only want to open or close the children of a certain row, not all or none
[16:06:01] <kojiro> Jax: not the children of a certain row
[16:06:04] <kojiro> *the row*
[16:06:15] <kojiro> or its following siblings until some limit
[16:06:23] <kojiro> if it were just the children, it'd be easy
[16:06:38] <Jax> well i could put the rows in a <tbody> ;)
[16:06:46] <Jax> then just hide the next tbody after that element
[16:06:47] <Jax> *hide*
[16:06:56] <kojiro> Jax: why don't you do that? :P
[16:07:01] <kojiro> Jax: put the header rows in a thead
[16:07:06] <kojiro> put the body rows in a tbody
[16:07:09] <kojiro> IT'S GENIUS
[16:07:11] <Jax> that's what i was saying earlier
[16:07:19] <kojiro> then you can just use CSS
[16:07:26] <Jax> but how do i get the "next" tbody
[16:07:36] <Jax> sorry i'm quite a newbie to jquery
[16:07:46] <kojiro> ok, well, forget I said CSS
[16:08:00] <kojiro> actually, remember I said CSS?
[16:08:05] <kojiro> thead ~ tbody
[16:08:11] <Jax> yes
[16:09:10] <Exnor> het guys
[16:09:17] <kojiro> Jax: that was it ^^^
[16:09:25] <Jax> yeah just noticed by reading the API haha
[16:09:31] <Jax> http://api.jquery.com/next-siblings-selector/
[16:09:34] <Exnor> having some MASSIVE problems with trying to get jQuery to play ball when being called through actionscript
[16:09:45] <kojiro> Jax: but you can just use css for this :)
[16:10:01] <Jax> how
[16:10:38] <kojiro> thead ~ tbody { display: none; } thead:hover ~ tbody { display: table-whatever-thingie; }
[16:10:57] <Exnor> ive been debugging this for 12 hours, and am on a deadline so willing to pay anyone to give me some tips -> can I get that here or shall I go for e.g. stackOverflow.com or something?
[16:11:05] <kojiro> Jax: if you want you can use jquery or css transitions for a goofy slideup effect
[16:11:19] <Jax> kojiro:  is that pure css?
[16:11:24] <kojiro> Jax: yes
[16:12:05] <njbair> is there a way to add my own custom functions to the jquery object?
[16:12:19] <itissid> There is a plugin that can bind observables to objects?
[16:12:20] <KWhat_Work> fuck
[16:12:23] <kojiro> njbair: of course
[16:12:28] <itissid> observables being the DOM
[16:12:43] <kojiro> njbair: javascript is a prototype-based OO language
[16:12:44] <njbair> without having to modify the jquery source since I'm using a CDN
[16:12:58] <cooki3s> is it possible to search the DOM for a string and replace it?
[16:13:00] <Jax> how do i find out which table-whatever is correct?
[16:13:03] <itissid> So that change in objects can raise events
[16:13:29] <kojiro> Jax: use firebug to see what a normal tbody's display is
[16:13:52] <njbair> kojiro: will my functions work with the effects queue? That's my whole reason for wanting to add my own
[16:14:11] <Joe7> hi
[16:14:16] <Jax> table-row-group it seems
[16:14:31] <kojiro> njbair: sure, if you make the right change. this is all very abstract
[16:14:59] <njbair> kojiro: yeah I know. actually this seems like more work than is necessary.
[16:15:15] <njbair> I'm trying to use some jquery inside of a setTimeout and it bugs out
[16:15:38] <t_morgan> hai
[16:15:39] <njbair> a.ownerDocument is undefined
[16:16:09] <t_morgan> can anybody help me? I'm attemping to use the filter() function or some such to fitler the children out of an xml document, and then continue using that document with the parent elements intact
[16:16:40] <t_morgan> ie. given:
[16:18:00] <t_morgan> <anode><bnode1 name="win" /><bnode2 name="lose" /></anode>
[16:18:06] <t_morgan> i want to be able to say
[16:18:36] <t_morgan> var wholeXml = $(theAboveDocument);
[16:19:03] <t_morgan> wholeXml.filter(someSelector)
[16:19:27] <t_morgan> or wholeXml = wholeXml.filter(someSelector);
[16:19:51] <Jax> kojiro:  but $("thead ~ tbody") selects all bodies
[16:19:54] <Jax> instead of just the following one
[16:19:59] <t_morgan> and have the result be <anode><bnode2 name="lose" /></anode>
[16:20:00] <t_morgan> for instance
[16:20:09] <t_morgan> where the someSelectorGuff has filtered out bnode1
[16:20:17] <t_morgan> but it's still a whole document with the root node
[16:20:24] <t_morgan> is this possible with jquery?
[16:20:40] <t_morgan> (i'm merely filtering on an AJAX response document)
[16:21:53] <KWhat_Work> anyone try and build jquery from git ?
[16:23:33] <ch3mical> t_morgan: try http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[16:23:52] <ch3mical> Oh wait, I think that's the opposite
[16:24:10] <ch3mical> You want to parse XML into an object, right?
[16:24:26] <Jax> that applies to all tbody elements kojiro
[16:24:37] <Jax> is it possible to select only the next tbody following the thead the link was clicked in?
[16:24:42] <andymac44> Any assistance with this would be much appreciated: http://jsfiddle.net/qJYbf/107/  The goal is to get all dialogs to open with a default containment.
[16:24:58] <Jax> <thead> ... <a>click</a>.</thead> <tbody .. select this one> ...... </tbody>
[16:25:29] <ch3mical> t_morgan: actually, parseXML might be exactly what you need
[16:25:45] <t_morgan> @ch3mical: is that not the same as $(someXML) ?
[16:26:02] <ch3mical> Nope
[16:26:26] <fructose> I can use help... I am creating a modal dialog with jQuery that uses an .ajax call to load another page in a div. However, that page doesn't have access to jQuery functions and loading them inside the page affects the original page. Anyone know what's going on?
[16:26:29] <ch3mical> You gotta do var xmlDoc = $.parseXML("<some><xml>...");
[16:26:42] <ch3mical> Then use $(xmlDoc)
[16:26:50] <ch3mical> Look at the documentation
[16:27:21] <t_morgan> <quote>XML data returned from an Ajax call can be passed to the $() function so individual elements of the XML structure can be retrieved using .find() and other DOM traversal methods.</quote>
[16:28:05] <ch3mical> t_morgan: because that's already parsed.. are you doing this inside an AJAX response handler?
[16:28:44] <t_morgan> yes. the document is response string
[16:28:52] <t_morgan> i can create a jquery from teh xml doc just fine. i just dunno how to filter it without losing the parent nodes
[16:28:55] <bapii> Hey! I currently have a jquery onclick wich triggers on clicking the link, is it possible to retrive the <li> its in?  <li><a href="#" title="content_3">Search</a></li>
[16:29:01] <bapii> Id like to change the <li> class
[16:29:21] <ch3mical> t_morgan: how about explaining what you ultimately want to achieve?
[16:29:41] <t_morgan> ie. if i do theDoc = theDoc.filter('bnode[name="lose"]');
[16:29:48] <ch3mical> bapii: .parent()
[16:30:09] <t_morgan> the result is <bnode1 name="win" />
[16:30:10] <ch3mical> t_morgan: don't tell me what you're doing, tell me what you want to accomplish
[16:30:16] <t_morgan> without the <anode> around it
[16:30:20] <t_morgan> okay ;)
[16:31:39] <t_morgan> i've got a popup div in the document. you click on a button and it does an ajax call, pops up this div with a tree of info in it (from the xml), arranged in collapsible divs)
[16:31:55] <t_morgan> i've added a date range widget to filter the results
[16:32:01] <ch3mical> ok
[16:32:18] <ch3mical> Sounds awesome
[16:32:21] <t_morgan> one of the attributes in one of the nodes in teh xml tree is a timestamp
[16:32:26] <ch3mical> And then?
[16:32:33] <t_morgan> i'm getting there :)
[16:32:39] <ch3mical> And theeeen?
[16:33:06] <sodapop> hi, i'm trying to add a facebook share button in my pages, problem is that when using facebook's sharer.php title and icon are ignored instead facebook crawls the page and reads this information from the og: meta fields, if i pass these meta values using jquery will it work?
[16:33:30] <ch3mical> -_-
[16:33:36] <t_morgan> there are other filters also, yet i process all of the filters at once, by applying each of the filters to the original xml, and then collapsing the divs that don't match with the new document
[16:33:45] <bapii> ok thanks, another question
[16:33:54] <ch3mical> bapii: 42
[16:33:58] <t_morgan> so i want to remove the elements that are outside the timestamp range entered in the widget
[16:33:59] <bapii> haha good one
[16:34:39] <t_morgan> but i still need the whole document encasing the results, not just the children i've filtered
[16:34:47] <bapii> If I have a div containing <li>s each with different classes, how can I remove all classes from the <li>s in the div #container?
[16:35:02] <ch3mical> t_morgan: so filter for the wrapping div instead and them traverse from there
[16:35:27] <ch3mical> bapii: use .each() and .removeClass ?
[16:35:38] <t_morgan> bapii $(div#container li).remove();
[16:36:14] <ch3mical> t_morgan: that would remove the whole element not just the classes
[16:36:52] <Jax> kojiro, got it with a beautiful this.parent.parent.next().css ... haha
[16:37:26] <t_morgan> ch3mical, i would, but the metadata from the xml is lost within the divs i've drawn. the way i'm comparing them is creating a new div from the xml element the same as would have happened the first draw, and comparing the html contents
[16:37:35] <t_morgan> if they match, i collapse it
[16:37:53] <t_morgan> this way i don't have to redraw the whole panel each time, and the user can watch them nicely slide up and down in a tree
[16:37:58] <ch3mical> Oh ok... well it's getting more complicated by the minute
[16:38:02] <ch3mical> Have an example?
[16:38:15] <t_morgan> let me see if ic an muster one ;)
[16:38:22] <bapii> ah thanks, each() did it
[16:38:22] <bapii> :P
[16:38:55] <Jax> thanks all
[16:40:11] <t_morgan> best i can explain here is (pseudo)
[16:40:54] <t_morgan> function 1 parses xml and creates divs, 1 per element 'a' and draws them to the panel using append()
[16:41:10] <t_morgan> the user enters a date range in the UI widget
[16:41:45] <t_morgan> function 2 takes teh dates and filters the xml based on the given dates
[16:41:57] <sodapop> hard to use open graph on ajax based pages
[16:42:06] <ch3mical> How are these dates stored in the DOM?
[16:42:29] <t_morgan> i'm u sing the jquery-UI dateSelector widget
[16:42:53] <t_morgan> when dates are entered, is tore the results in some global variables in the js
[16:43:01] <t_morgan> function 2 then checks those globals and filters
[16:43:03] <ch3mical> Right, but how do you associate the date to those DOM elements when you're creating them?
[16:43:16] <t_morgan> i don't, let me finish
[16:43:20] <ch3mical> Sorry
[16:43:21] <t_morgan> :P
[16:43:21] <ch3mical> :)
[16:43:34] <t_morgan> this is the clever part ;)
[16:43:43] <t_morgan> there's no room for all the associated metadata i the html
[16:43:43] <t_morgan> so
[16:43:48] <ch3mical> So how does it feel?
[16:43:51] <t_morgan> G00D
[16:44:08] <ch3mical> lol
[16:44:28] <ch3mical> t_morgan: have you considered using .data()?
[16:45:20] <t_morgan> function 3 is now called with the filtered xml. it creates divs just like function 1 did, except, instead of adding them to the document, it then loops through the current divs in the document and compares the html of the new one with each one already drawn
[16:45:26] <t_morgan> if any matches are found, those divs are collapsed
[16:47:38] <ch3mical> So function3 gets a list of some sort and compares it to the DOM
[16:47:47] <ch3mical> And that's where shit breaks?
[16:48:28] <ch3mical> Because you need the containing div on those elements
[16:48:45] <t_morgan> no, function 3 does exactly the same thing as function 1 - it parses the xml document and creates divs (using the same function as function 1 uses to create teh divs), then it compares the .html() of those new divs with the oens already drawn
[16:49:08] <ch3mical> I wonder if .closest() works with .filter()...
[16:49:12] <t_morgan> tbh i think my real problem is that find() looks for descendants
[16:49:28] <t_morgan> so it doesn't find any of the inner element when teh document has no root element
[16:49:34] <t_morgan> cz it'sj ust a list of the inner ones
[16:49:52] <ch3mical> Try .closest or .parent/.parents
[16:50:12] <Shadow> Hi, I am getting this error if using jquery-1.4.4.min.js. uncaught exception: [Exception... "Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOMDocumentFragment.appendChild]" nsresult: "0x80570009 (NS_ERROR_XPC_BAD_CONVERT_JS)" location: "JS frame :: http://127.0.0.1/ext/jquery/jquery-1.4.4.min.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 124" data: no]
[16:50:23] <ch3mical> Chain one of those in somewhere and you might be able to get the containing div
[16:50:38] <Shadow> But I it works fine with jquery-1.4.2.min.js
[16:52:01] <t_morgan> it's not actually a problem to have lost the outer elements, because i can just run the filters in order of tree level
[16:52:16] <t_morgan> the problem is that function 1 uses .find to get the inner elements
[16:52:28] <t_morgan> and that only looks for descendants of the current node
[16:52:34] <ch3mical> True
[16:52:36] <t_morgan> so it won't find the 3 "root"s
[16:52:45] <ch3mical> Also true
[16:52:51] <Chibby_> does anyone know what event(s) i have to look for to check if a textbox's contents have been modified? i've using keyup() and that adequately captures it when it's modified with the keyboard, but it can't capture modifications with the mouse (right click->paste)
[16:53:02] <t_morgan> is there any way i can traverse those with something like find, which finds all elements not just descendants?
[16:53:11] <ch3mical> Chibby_: change?
[16:53:17] <t_morgan> perhaps jsut .each would do it
[16:53:28] <Chibby_> ch3mical: that only triggers when you leave the textbox
[16:53:29] <Shadow> Can anyone help with my question, please
[16:53:32] <t_morgan> since the problem is only resident when we're at the bottom of the tree
[16:53:40] <Chibby_> would like it to happen as soon as you change it
[16:53:51] <t_morgan> parsing all elements at the bottom would be fine
[16:54:56] <ch3mical> t_morgan: maybe have to just start a few steps up
[16:55:40] <t_morgan> but there are other filters for the outer elements using these same procedure
[16:55:53] <t_morgan> so by the time they're all done all we have left is a list of leaves
[16:56:01] <t_morgan> which is the problem - because then find stops working
[16:56:29] <ch3mical> Can't do $(leaf).parent().find() ?
[16:56:52] <t_morgan> i would think that the parents have completely gone, but maybe
[16:57:18] <ch3mical> I'm trying to help as much as I can, but it's hard without seeing an example lol
[16:57:29] <t_morgan> yeah, in know, sorry
[16:57:53] <t_morgan> but it's fairly large
[16:58:10] <t_morgan> nevermind, thx for your help, i'll try some of these thigns in the morning :)
[16:58:20] <ch3mical> haha ok
[16:58:21] <ch3mical> Good luck
[16:58:42] <t_morgan> cheers ;)!
[16:59:15] <Chat3314> ey
[16:59:25] <eddiemonge> general js question: how can i have a variable be part of an object name? http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/M4Skc/
[17:00:54] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: I would set a variable outside first.. like var mykey = "data"+hello+"more"; yo = { mykey: "yes" };
[17:00:57] <ch3mical> Would that work?
[17:01:19] <eddiemonge> not really
[17:01:57] <eddiemonge> and that doesnt do it anyway
[17:02:03] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/M4Skc/1/
[17:02:04] <ch3mical> Works for me
[17:02:27] <ch3mical> Wait, no, the key was set to mykey
[17:02:33] <eddiemonge> ?eval var mykey = "data"+hello+"more"; yo = { mykey: "yes" }; yo;
[17:02:41] <eddiemonge> oh forgot bot-t is dead
[17:05:48] <ch3mical> Hmm
[17:05:58] <ch3mical> No, I don't think you can do that
[17:06:02] <ch3mical> Why do you need to?
[17:09:05] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[17:09:43] <itissid> Is there like an online tool to draw an HTML widget and then just take away the HTML?
[17:10:16] <wkmanire> itissid: A visual designer for a widget?
[17:10:40] <itissid> wkmanire, Yeah..
[17:10:45] <itissid> That is in pure HTML
[17:11:18] <wkmanire> itissid: There aren't any HTML elements that support a drawing interface except for the canvas, and the canvas requires javascript to be useful.
[17:11:36] <itissid> wkmanire, Something like this must exist
[17:11:47] <itissid> wkmanire, There is hype
[17:11:48] <wkmanire> itissid: No, not really. You can use flash.
[17:11:57] <itissid> Hype framework i am cheking it out
[17:12:13] <wkmanire> itissid: It won't just be HTML, it will have javascript too.
[17:12:24] <wkmanire> itissid: Or it will be a browser plugin/extension
[17:13:28] <wkmanire> itissid: Hype framework for instance is based in Flash and AS3.
[17:13:36] <wkmanire> Action Script 3 is a relative of javascript.
[17:14:47] <itissid> hmm
[17:19:29] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: I think you're going to have to just nest the data, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/M4Skc/15/
[17:20:16] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: youre missing the point. i dont want to use mykey as the value, i want to use it as the key (index)
[17:20:21] <ch3mical> Then you can get the value of object.key to check against the value of "hello"
[17:20:33] <EM03> question, is their anything in jquery to help make widgets?
[17:20:34] <njbair> what object does .append() return? I can't chain anything after it to modify the original element
[17:20:45] <imthenachoman> hey guys...im having trouble figuring one thing out. i am trying to figure out a way to find all text nodes (so I can iterate through em and do find/replace for a string) that are not in <a>...  so I got this far      $("table[summary='"+name+"']").contents().filter( (function(){ return this.nodeType == 3 || this.nodeName == "BR" ; });
[17:21:13] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: I think you misunderstand how JSON works, then.. they key value (left of ":") can only be a string
[17:21:43] <ch3mical> So "this"+somevar+"that" won't work, it doesn't get parsed
[17:22:17] <ch3mical> You could try writing it as a string first and then do JSON.parse... ?
[17:22:19] <wkmanire> EM03: Look at the widget factory on jquery ui
[17:22:34] <IceD^> hello. there is $.parseJSON() is there $.toJSON() or smth?
[17:22:46] <EM03> wkmanire: I'm making a web app where I want everything to be very unified
[17:22:51] <IceD^> hehe - alot of json qs :)
[17:23:00] <EM03> i could do that with just css but is that a better way to do it ?
[17:23:14] <wkmanire> EM03: Sure. Thats a great idea. Use the jQuery-ui CSS framework.
[17:23:31] <wkmanire> EM03: Odds are you won't need to build a custom widget from scratch, but you might need to composite some of the widgets together.
[17:23:38] <EM03> have you ever used sproutcore? some people use it like that?
[17:23:45] <eddiemonge> ch3mical: actually you are wrong. the key can have a variable but only if its written like  var jsobj['string'+variable].  and its an object, not json
[17:23:46] <wkmanire> EM03: The widgetfactory makes that a lot easier and you'll also be doing it the same way the core staff does it.
[17:25:24] <ch3mical> eddiemonge: ok, I thought you were trying to build a JSON object
[17:25:42] <wkmanire> EM03: I have not.
[17:25:53] <imthenachoman> anyone have an idea to my question?
[17:26:05] <EM03> wkmanire: yea hmmm
[17:26:21] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: Sort of an uncommon thing to do. jQuery generally wants to work with elements and not with text nodes.
[17:26:56] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: i often travel the uncommon route...heh
[17:26:58] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: You might want to use jQuery to find the containing elements and then use the native DOM API to get at the text.
[17:27:57] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: Just remember that some browsers use innerText and others use textContent properties.
[17:28:11] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: only care bout IE7
[17:28:17] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: i just realized i can't use JS .replace on the entire DOM cause it only works on strings.
[17:28:17] * wkmanire cringes.
[17:28:25] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: me too...but thats the requirement
[17:28:57] <wkmanire> $(body).html() will give you all of the DOM as a string I think
[17:29:07] <wkmanire> You can then use a regex on it and fix the text up
[17:29:14] <wkmanire> then reassign body.html with your result.
[17:29:24] <wkmanire> That would be the carpet bombing approach.
[17:30:04] <wkmanire> Just have to make sure the expressions are very explicit so as not to munch elements unintentionally.
[17:30:55] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: ehh...this is a big a$$ sharepoint site, witha lot of content so not gonna try that
[17:31:33] <wkmanire> :D
[17:35:43] <imthenachoman> how can i filter for nodes that don't have an <a> as a parent node?
[17:36:01] <imthenachoman> .filter( function(){ this.....?
[17:36:34] <wkmanire> a.parentNode.tagName !== 'A'
[17:36:43] <wkmanire> elm* rather
[17:36:47] <wkmanire> elm.parentNode.tagName
[17:37:23] <imthenachoman> that goes only 1 level up though? right?
[17:37:29] <wkmanire> yes
[17:38:03] <imthenachoman> how can i make it go up to root node? so no parent
[17:38:17] <Brodingo> ?closest
[17:38:34] <wkmanire> bot-t: Yoooo hooo
[17:38:36] <Brodingo> godamnit bot-t
[17:41:43] <wkmanire> var begotOfAnchor = false; (function(node) { while(node !== null) { if (node.tagName === 'A') { begotOfAnchor = true; return; }  arguments.callee.apply(this, node.parentNode);   }(node.parentNode)); if (begotOfAnchor === true) { /* do something! */}
[17:41:44] <wkmanire> he he
[17:41:50] <wkmanire> I should have fiddled that
[17:42:12] <wkmanire> its an infinite loop anyway
[17:42:16] <wkmanire> but you get the idea.
[17:42:32] <wkmanire> totally don't need that while loop
[17:42:38] <wkmanire> just an if.
[17:43:06] <wkmanire> anyway.....
[17:45:36] <imthenachoman> im trying to figure it out right now
[17:46:01] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/mx2T3/
[17:46:03] <wkmanire> thats better
[17:48:20] <imthenachoman> thats mootools?
[17:48:39] <wkmanire> Is what mootools?
[17:49:50] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/mx2T3/3/
[17:49:52] <wkmanire> that one actually works even
[17:50:06] <wkmanire> Just using jQuery.
[17:51:01] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/KhqzJ/ another example with the anchor further up the tree.
[17:51:09] <cooki3s> hey guys, is it possible to deny a stylesheet from loading completely with jquery?
[17:51:35] <cooki3s> for example, I want to deny my stylesheet from loading with my jquery script
[17:51:36] <cgcardona> i'm using two for loops to show some graphic changes on my site but they are executing too quickly to notice. What can I do to cause a pause in each iteration of these for loops? http://pastebin.com/YXaWg1Yq
[17:52:14] <cgcardona> I know delay() exists but I'm not sure how to use it in this context. Any suggestions?
[17:52:44] <wkmanire> cooki3s: You can remove the stylesheet from the DOM by giving the element an ID to select it with.
[17:52:55] <wkmanire> $('#victimStyleSheet').remove()
[17:53:06] <EM03> wkmanire: or maybe I'm just being lazy and should create some solid css classes, maybe using js to just display a button is not the best idea
[17:53:29] <wkmanire> EM03: huh?
[17:53:29] <ngharo> ?mdc setTimeout @ cgcardona
[17:53:45] <EM03> wkmanire: maybe I should just do my widget set in pure css and stop being lazy hehe
[17:54:04] <wkmanire> You should use as much CSS as possible
[17:54:07] <cooki3s> wkmanire: it does it too late though, maybe from another insight, is it possible to apply a stylesheet before the website starts loading, so it loads a black background instead of white?
[17:54:17] <wkmanire> and use javascript only when you need a behavior not provided by the HTML elements.
[17:55:25] <wkmanire> cooki3s: The thing is the stylesheet will have finished processing before the javascript will know it exists
[17:55:50] <EM03> wkmanire: so maybe using js and stuff to display button and other widgets it just not needed
[17:56:19] <wkmanire> It really depends on what you want to accomplish.
[17:57:00] <EM03> hmm yea
[17:57:19] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: Did that little algo work for you?
[17:58:49] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: haven't got that far...i'm still trying to do something else, can you look at http://jsfiddle.net/QRRX4/  it's not changing the text nodes like id expect
[17:58:56] <ngharo> cooki3s: you can set your styles at anytime.  they get applied immediately
[18:00:09] <cooki3s> ngharo: yes but when I load my site it goes white background, then applies black with my javascript
[18:00:31] <jar04h> How can find out which link was clicked after a page refresh?
[18:01:29] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/dx22x/
[18:03:23] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: humm..ty
[18:03:49] <wkmanire> np
[18:04:30] <wkmanire> abbbbbbbbjjjjoooorn. hi
[18:04:40] <ngharo> cooki3s: i dont really understand what you're trying to do.  sorry
[18:05:51] <cooki3s> ngharo: I have a html page with white background stylesheet attached to it. I want to interrupt that stylesheet and instead paint the background black directly upon pageload.
[18:06:19] <imthenachoman> wkmanire: interesting, so if text node is nested in an element its not included...this wont work for me. i'll figure something else out. thanks sir
[18:06:47] <wkmanire> imthenachoman: No problems. Press on . good luck :)
[18:07:13] <ngharo> cooki3s: can't you just modify the stylesheet?  else put an inline style before your JS with body { background-color: black !important }
[18:07:36] <mutex_> is there a way to get the parent node of the location i've dropped a dragged item into
[18:07:54] <abjorn> I could really use +1 Stamina right now, god damn
[18:07:57] <abjorn> or +99
[18:08:06] <mutex_> $('...').draggable({stop:function(){ ???? }});
[18:08:16] <cooki3s> ngharo: its a greasemonkey script :P
[18:09:17] <ngharo> mutex_: you probably want .closest( )
[18:10:54] <mutex_> ngharo: here's what i tried: http://pastie.org/private/1or2rbysi2h72dctlcta
[18:14:19] <ngharo> markup?
[18:14:44] <mutex_> ?
[18:15:10] <ngharo> i dont have any context of what anything is without your markup
[18:15:39] <mutex_> the HTML, you mean?
[18:15:49] <ngharo> what are you trying to get? all .lineitems in the same container as the active one?
[18:16:23] <ngharo> mutex_: yes html
[18:16:29] <mutex_> something like this: http://pastie.org/private/g08t2kthmqsw2q8vyseq
[18:16:50] <mutex_> if lineitem from group_2 is moved to group_1, i want to be able to get the new parent group
[18:17:27] <ngharo> $(this).parent() should do it
[18:18:30] <mutex_> i tried doing that, but when i did so, i got the parent of the group i was coming from
[18:18:46] <mutex_> lineitem leaves group_1, enters group_2, but $(this).parent() = group_1
[18:29:17] <geestring> Is it possible to change the opacity of the border attribute? I want to have TDs with border bottoms and have those fade in one row after the other
[18:29:35] <cooki3s> how can i replace a certain string in the source code? for example I want to find "humbug!" and replace it with "christmas!"
[18:29:50] <imsky> cooki3s: what
[18:29:57] <Caraes_Naur> geestring: try rgba(r, g, b, a) notation
[18:30:06] <Caraes_Naur> for the border color
[18:30:13] <cooki3s> imsky whats unclear? :p
[18:30:20] <imsky> cooki3s: everything
[18:31:04] <ngharo> mutex_: sounds like you need a sortable
[18:31:08] <ngharo> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[18:31:39] <cooki3s> why is it unclear ><
[18:32:24] <geestring> Caraes, do i need a plugin in for that?
[18:34:02] <Caraes_Naur> only in ie < 8 probably
[18:36:19] <cooki3s> ok, how would I select an XPath with jquery?
[18:36:35] <snover> you wouldn’t
[18:36:41] <snover> because that’s not how jquery works
[18:37:12] <kojiro> heh
[18:37:14] <imsky> http://01100110011101010110001101101011011011110110011001100110.com/
[18:38:02] <kojiro> imsky: someone loves the Internet
[18:39:03] <IceD^> imsky, looks like that dude's trying to do some perl code
[18:39:11] <imsky> oh yes
[18:40:16] <kojiro> "That's because Python don't tear people's arms out when they can't code. Perl's been known to do that." "I suggest a new strategy, R2, let the Perl go."
[18:42:11] <Taggnostr> I have a page with a js script that currently uses window.onload to add an element to the page. I have to add another function to add another element in another place and this time I'd like to use jquery.  What is the best way to make it work with the old function? and is using .load() on the container element the best way to do that?
[18:54:53] <imsky> coldhead: why did you ban that guy
[18:56:06] <coldhead> it's a bot
[18:57:25] <Jantire> My accordion widget isn't showing up, here's the code http://pastie.org/1978910

[18:57:32] <Jantire> any help?
[18:59:18] <imsky> hello fellow ror sufferer
[19:00:19] <Jantire> hi
[19:06:53] <imsky> hello Jantire
[19:07:49] <a_L_p> does anyone know of a way to select all elements between two specific elements? for example: http://d.pr/zF9A if I want to wrap everything between .first-row and .last-row, knowing that the number of divs between them varies. is there a way to do that?
[19:09:59] <Jantire> Why would the function $(document).ready(function() { }) never get run?
[19:10:04] <Jantire> like what would make the document never readyu
[19:10:17] <Whirl3d> Good Evenin all. Here's a simple quick question: If I have a function that returns a jQuery collection, can I use the function in-line with a selector method like; getTabs(tabStyle).first()   where getTabs is a function that returns a jQuery collection. Or do I have to write a plugin/extend a widgest/ clone jQuery, try another method?
[19:11:01] <Whirl3d> Jantire, if there was an open script tag in the header, for example. it would not run.
[19:11:36] <Jantire> No open script tag here
[19:11:56] <phuong> testing
[19:11:58] <Jantire> Here's entire documnet http://pastie.org/1978959
[19:11:59] <Whirl3d> Jantire, any other html errors? Is jQuery loading?
[19:12:21] <Jantire> Yeah I can manually create the accordion item in Chrome
[19:12:26] <Jantire> (After the page has loaded)
[19:12:36] <Whirl3d> Where is your jquery script? I missed it
[19:12:50] <Jantire> line 31-39
[19:13:09] <Whirl3d> No, where do you load jquery?
[19:13:17] <Jantire> Oh that's in the application.erb file
[19:13:21] <Jantire> It loads all jQuery stuff
[19:13:28] <Jantire> (on all views)
[19:14:18] <Whirl3d> Perhaps that's the problem. I am not familiar with that. Can you verify that jquery is loaded in firebug? It sounds like jquery isn't being loaded (at first glance)
[19:14:18] <Jantire> Would you like to see that?
[19:14:38] <Whirl3d> <--no expert here, but sure I'll look at it
[19:14:58] <Jantire> Actually I can just give you the markup for the actual rendered page (and not just the view's erb file)
[19:15:08] <Jantire> http://pastie.org/1978977
[19:16:35] <Whirl3d> Is it possible that you are having problems with protoype conflicts?
[19:17:17] <Jantire> I don't think so, this accordion was working a few days ago
[19:17:37] <Jantire> and when I manually put in $(#accordion).accordion(); it works just fine
[19:19:49] <Whirl3d> Jantire, do you have an accordian class as well as an id
[19:19:54] <Jantire> nope
[19:19:58] <Jantire> I didn't need to before
[19:20:01] <Jantire> but I can put it in
[19:20:15] <Whirl3d> $(".accordian .header") may be the problem then...?
[19:20:39] <Whirl3d> line 34 of the first pastie
[19:20:59] <Jantire> It should still show up whether or not it's set to hide
[19:21:17] <abjorn> http://goo.gl/hJyGS Two-mouthed fish? Totes McGotes
[19:21:24] <Whirl3d> shouldn't it be $("#accodian .header")
[19:21:30] <abjorn> And thus I continue my campaign of being off topic on every IRC Channel I'm in
[19:21:54] <Jantire> without that line I can still create an accordion manually via the rendered HTML page
[19:22:21] <Whirl3d> Sure, but you would select it using $("#accordian") not $(".accordian"), right?
[19:22:51] <Jantire> $(document).ready(function(){
[19:22:51] <Jantire> 				$('#accordion').accordion();
[19:22:51] <Jantire> 				SetupAccordionItems();
[19:22:51] <Jantire> 				});
[19:22:53] <Jantire> That's what I did
[19:23:07] <Jantire> I also removed that second group of lines
[19:23:12] <Jantire> (making it "clickable"
[19:23:13] <Jantire> )
[19:23:19] <Jantire> and it didn't even need that to be removed
[19:23:41] <Taggnostr> I often have a button that toggle()s other elements, but I always have to write 2 different function just to be able to change the text of the button. Is there a way to avoid this?
[19:24:35] <Taggnostr> what I write is like button.toggle(function(){ something.toggle(); button.text('show') }, function(){ something.toggle(); button.text('hide') })
[19:25:15] <Whirl3d> What about line 45, jslint says there's an error there
[19:25:24] <LocalPCGuy> taggnostr you could just check the text, and if it equals the "show" text then hide it, otherwise do the opposite
[19:25:43] <Whirl3d> Yep, that's it jslint stops there.
[19:26:17] <Whirl3d> var AssignmentsDueNextSchoolDay = <%= GetByDueDateForCurrentUser(@nex..    should be var AssignmentsDueNextSchoolDay =$(" <%= GetByDueDateForCurrentUser(@nex..  or something
[19:26:45] <Taggnostr> LocalPCGuy, I was hoping in something like toggleText()
[19:26:55] <Jantire> That <%= > is ERB
[19:27:04] <Jantire> for invoking a helper method
[19:27:24] <imsky> ror must die
[19:27:25] <Whirl3d> again, sorry, not familiar with ERB, perhaps it's creating a conflict with jquery.
[19:27:32] <imsky> no it's not Whirl3d
[19:27:47] <Jantire> Why should RoR die? At this point it's much better than Node or similar
[19:27:54] <Jantire> (Much better for most scenarios)
[19:28:16] <Whirl3d> cool. imsky you are on...balls in your court. Sorry I couldn't be of more help Jantire.
[19:28:35] <LocalPCGuy> Taggnostr no need for a built in function for that, it's pretty easy to write something like that, just a few lines of code to swap things around
[19:28:37] <Jantire> It's alright
[19:29:21] <imsky> lol
[19:29:23] <imsky> ror should die
[19:29:28] <imsky> because there are no beautifiers for it
[19:29:49] <heshanh> guys, i have ihave a ul li ul li ( as in a list inside a li), how do i only select the first ul->il. when do #menu ul li, it picks the first ul-li and then the next set to
[19:29:58] <imsky> Jantire: i can help you, PM me if interested
[19:32:35] <Taggnostr> LocalPCGuy, not so elegant, but I used th.text(th.text() == 'Show History' ? 'Hide History' : 'Show History');
[19:32:47] <LocalPCGuy> heshanh you could just get $("#menu ul li").not("#menu li li")
[19:33:25] <acidjazz> if i do a blur event
[19:33:36] <heshanh> thats the thing i dont want it to go to the 2nd li
[19:33:38] <heshanh> just the first li
[19:33:42] <acidjazz> is there somehow a way to get hte class name of the element i click when i blur?
[19:33:45] <LocalPCGuy> taggnostr yep, that sounds good
[19:33:54] <LocalPCGuy> heshanh that's why you need the .not() part
[19:34:13] <heshanh> oh right i miss read that
[19:35:16] <Taggnostr> can someone look at my function and tell me if something could be done better? http://dpaste.com/547072/ (10 lines)
[19:36:01] <Taggnostr> the script adds a 'show history' button as last tr in a table and hides the other trs when it's clicked
[19:38:56] <orolo> selector problem: i'm clicking on a <tr> that buried. i need to search up the DOM until i find a specific class. can i do that?
[19:39:35] <ngharo> .closest('.class')
[19:39:57] <orolo> ?closest()
[19:40:05] <orolo> ?.closest
[19:40:29] <orolo> ngharo: cool. thanks.
[19:40:53] <Hornet-> more of a firebug than jquery question, but any way to get anything more useful than 'missing ) after argument list' (nonsensical code line here) from firebug?
[19:41:01] <heshanh> still no good
[19:41:01] <heshanh> http://jsfiddle.net/eGeMr/
[19:41:11] <Hornet-> I presume I'm passing something errant to jquery, but can't see what, where, or why
[19:44:09] <Hornet-> ah got it, chain variable declaration with a missing ; after the end
[19:44:24] <Hornet-> but it was in a completely different file to the one firebug was pointing at
[19:49:44] <Justin_> I'm having this strange problem with dynamically making youtube video autoplay: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6145735/youtube-video-not-autoplaying-first-time-code-is-executed
[19:55:13] <Justin_> anyone here?
[19:56:46] <tbranyen> i was here, but then i left
[19:56:47] <tbranyen> sorry
[19:56:53] <Justin_> hah
[19:57:17] <Justin_> tbranyen: have any idea why this might be happening? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6145735/youtube-video-not-autoplaying-first-time-code-is-executed
[19:58:29] <tbranyen> Justin_: youtube has an API why not just use that instead?
[19:58:53] <Justin_> tbranyen: well I'm using the embedly API
[19:59:01] <Justin_> tbranyen: to turn links into videos
[19:59:05] <Justin_> and thumbnails
[19:59:33] <tbranyen> did you verify that it actually changed the source?
[19:59:53] <tbranyen> the DOM rather
[20:01:30] <Justin_> tbranyen: yes it did
[20:01:39] <Justin_> tbranyen: even the first time
[20:01:54] <Justin_> tbranyen: still on the first click, the video does not play automatically
[20:02:02] <Justin_> weird :/
[20:02:17] <tbranyen> when you click it again, aren't you just click on the youtube video?
[20:02:20] <tbranyen> so obv it would play?
[20:02:28] <Justin_> i click on a different one
[20:02:50] <ngharo> when are you creating the param and embed elements?
[20:03:28] <Justin_> on the page load
[20:03:41] <Justin_> i do it with the http://embed.ly/ API
[20:03:58] <Justin_> i turn the video urls into videos and thumbnails
[20:04:05] <Justin_> hide the video right away
[20:04:17] <tbranyen> i don't know enough about the embedly api to really help you with this :-/
[20:04:19] <Justin_> clicking the thumbnail hihdes the thubmnail and shows the video
[20:04:45] <Justin_> the youtube apis are pretty awesome though
[20:04:56] <tbranyen> Justin_: pretty sure if its turning it into a youtube video it will call the callback in the youtube api and you could just call play from there
[20:04:59] <tbranyen> i'm not sure
[20:05:02] <tbranyen> but again
[20:08:25] <swiggy> how can i tell if a value preexist's in an array?
[20:08:39] <heshanh> this is screws
[20:08:53] <heshanh> thers no way to not to select the second set ot ul->li
[20:10:36] <orolo> i'm trying to combine a variable and a selector: $(foo '.link'). so 'link' is the descendent of the foo variable.
[20:11:06] <orolo> foo is a dom element.
[20:11:38] <ngharo> reverse it
[20:11:40] <ngharo> add comma
[20:12:12] <orolo> ngharo: ok. so the second param is the context. thanks.
[20:12:29] <ngharo> aye
[20:16:58] <sdio> Hello, I'm trying to add some list filtering on a fairly large list using jquery, around 2000 items, just want to make sure that's not going to be slow as long I avoid dom manipulation for searching? (i.e, keep an array or such of the items->ids, search the array, hide/show itemids, rather than using .contains() on dom items?)
[20:20:35] <orolo> how do i find all of the '&' in a string?
[20:21:19] <gigantor> Hi, got a question about jQuery-UI and what version of jQuery core it's supposed to use.
[20:24:37] <Funhouse> Hi guys, does anyone know what this error means? "Attempting to render non-numeric value"
[20:28:21] <gigantor> I upgraded to the last versions of jQuery (1.6.1) and UI (1.8.13) and I find that UI's autocomplete now gives javascript errors - "e.nodeName is undefined" - when I use the mouse or keyboard to select an entry from the autocomplete dropdown list of matches.  UI 1.8.13 works fine with jQuery 1.5.1 (which is shipped with it).  Is UI supposed to work with jQuery 1.6?  I haven't found anything definitive.  Thanks!
[20:32:21] <blackboard> Any jquery autosuggest plugins that will allow me to return two fields of a single result, say name and description below it
[20:41:15] <blackboard> ?
[20:41:41] <felo> i have two forms
[20:43:29] <felo> one comments and one responses. When I slide toggle the responses form, at the moment of insertion how can I id the first comment so the jquery, php or script knows what comment will be responsed to?
[20:44:18] <snover> wat?
[20:44:58] <felo>  how do I id the comment form the parent so I can insert in the response row the id of the parent comment?
[20:45:34] <felo> I have two form one for response and another for the comment parent
[20:46:03] <felo> where do id the parent form so that when the response form slidetoggle knows to what comment parent it belongs too?
[20:47:32] <ngharo> use a data attribute
[20:48:53] <snover> wat?
[20:49:51] <snover> felo: you loosely strung together words to resemble sentences, but they are not understandable as sentences
[20:52:16] <ngharo> i think he wants to keep a context of whats on the server side db
[20:55:31] <blast_hardcheese> Hey all; I've got some weird behaviour in WebKit: I'm building an <img /> and adding it to the DOM; I also have a .load() bound to that image that, when the load is complete, sets the CSS left, top, and height parameters of the div that the image I just created was added to.
[20:55:36] <felo> snover I have to form one for parent comment and another for responses
[20:56:17] <blast_hardcheese> I think I've got a race condition somewhere, but the question is still valid since the end result is the same
[20:56:22] <felo> how will responses know to what comment parent they belong ?
[20:56:40] <sdio> felo: data-target
[20:56:43] <felo> I know that by creating a field where it insert the id of each parent form
[20:56:56] <felo> @sdio 'how?
[20:57:10] <blast_hardcheese> The WebKit inspector tells me that the div is 100x100 at 0,0 (The default coordinates), despite the fact that the view is where it should be.
[20:57:22] <blast_hardcheese> Is this a bug in Javascript, Jquery, or WebKit?
[20:57:26] <felo> by creating a field wher eit save the comment parent id for responses?
[20:57:36] <felo> That for the INSERT
[20:57:43] <felo> I am talking at the moment of inserting
[20:58:32] <ngharo> you get parent comment from a database, yes?
[20:59:14] <felo> yes sr there is a field that will save both responses and comment text
[20:59:15] <sdio> If you're asking about schema design for your database, I think #sql might be a better place.
[20:59:37] <felo> sdio the jquery comes in handy
[20:59:57] <sdio> for writing your db's schema?
[21:00:08] <sdio> is there anything jquery can
[21:00:09] <sdio> t' do!
[21:00:14] <ngharo> felo: and the comment is wrapped in a div, yes?
[21:00:16] <sdio> </sarcasm>
[21:00:29] <snover> sdio: impart knowledge upon the clueless masses
[21:00:38] <blackboard> Any jquery autosuggest plugins that will allow me to return two fields of a single result, say name and description below it
[21:01:08] <felo> it is wrap in a p tag in this case
[21:01:18] <felo> the p tag has an id of only
[21:01:26] <sdio> snover: scheduled for v2
[21:01:34] <sdio> snover: get with the roadmap, dude.
[21:02:32] <felo> at the moment of slide toggle the text comment how can I grab the id of the parent comment?
[21:02:51] <felo> so that it save it and INSERT it as part of the resposne
[21:03:48] <ngharo> felo: add a data attribute to it when it's created. i.e. <p data-dbid=$dbid>
[21:04:56] <ngharo> then on the click event to respond, all you need to do is $(this).closest('p').data('dbid') to get the ID
[21:05:04] <ngharo> or something
[21:05:40] <felo> ok I have this <p id="only" data=dbid=$dbid > ' . $comment . '>p>
[21:05:55] <felo> do I have to initiate the variable $dbid?
[21:06:37] <felo> or what you gave me is going to be for the slidetoggle comment text?
[21:07:32] <ngharo> felo: this is getting confusing.  why dont you paste some code
[21:07:41] <felo> ok
[21:07:45] <felo> before that I have a question
[21:08:03] <ngharo> quota exceeded
[21:08:21] <felo> is data an html attribute?
[21:08:34] <felo> in this case
[21:09:45] <ngharo> ya
[21:10:36] <sdio> quota off by one?
[21:11:31] <ngharo> hehe :)
[21:11:46] <prurigro> anyone know why using .attr("checked", false); could work once but not again, when everything else in the function runs fine?
[21:13:32] <ngharo> what version of jquery are you using?
[21:14:11] <prurigro> @ngharo: if you're referring to my question, I'm pretty sure I have 1.6.1, but it could be 1.6
[21:14:20] <prurigro> might this have been a bug that got fixed if its the earlier?
[21:15:04] <ngharo> use prop instead
[21:15:37] <prurigro> prop?
[21:15:52] <ngharo> yes prop('checked', false)
[21:16:03] <prurigro> ohh interesting
[21:16:27] <prurigro> I haven't looked into that function, let me take a look
[21:18:51] <felo> ngharo here is the code
[21:19:03] <felo> with only the response form
[21:19:20] <felo> it is suppose to toggle right now is not doing it
[21:19:28] <felo> I think is because I have it in mootools
[21:19:29] <felo> wait
[21:19:44] <felo> http://jsfiddle.net/xysxD/6/
[21:19:48] <felo> that's the fiddle
[21:20:16] <felo> yes that was the reason
[21:20:29] <prurigro> @ngharo: interesting- it seems the same except that its only the first in the collection of returned items-- are you just thinking to try this as an alternative?
[21:20:56] <felo> ngharo you mention to add a data attribute to it to what ? the comment text
[21:32:12] <prurigro> @ngharo: fantastic- It worked like a charm! I can't thank you enough
[21:33:42] <prurigro> this was taking far too many hours I didn't have-- let me know if I can do you any favours to say thanks :)
[21:44:01] <ngharo> beer me
[21:45:05] <ngharo> :]

[21:58:28] <Jester831> is there a way to put variables directly in strings without breaking strings up and using +'s
[22:00:41] <Brodingo> could probably do some kind of str replace or array join but why would you

[22:01:26] <ngharo> prurigro: first one is free
[22:01:35] <ngharo> Jester831: you might want to look into templates
[22:01:36] <Jester831> I didn't know if there was a simple way similar to php
[22:01:37] <ngharo> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[22:01:47] <Jester831> templates aren't very good last time I checked
[22:06:36] <prurigro> @ngharo: haha- well then, thanks again! I'll return the favour if I ever get a chance :)

[22:32:33] <JSJunkie> hello everyone
[22:33:11] <JSJunkie> I'm trying to select the first child of a div using class name...but it just selects the div itself
[22:33:30] <JSJunkie> $(".classgoeshere:first-child")
[22:33:35] <JSJunkie> is this the correct syntax?
[22:33:51] <Cork> $(".classgoeshere *:first-child")
[22:33:59] <JSJunkie> o.o
[22:34:03] <Cork> or $(".classgoeshere > :first-child")
[22:34:22] <JSJunkie> sure enough...worked
[22:34:25] <Cork> first-child is "this class that is the first child of the parent"
[22:34:25] <JSJunkie> thanks!
[22:34:42] <Cork> np
[22:34:43] <JSJunkie> oh
[22:34:52] <JSJunkie> alright...will keep that in mind
[23:12:05] <wkmanire> Howdy folks
[23:12:21] * wkmanire is downloading Mint 11 Katya! Wheeeeee. :D
[23:26:19] <amirite> phew
[23:27:15] <fire> Hi, is there an oncomplete callback for .html() or an alternative function
[23:27:41] <abjorn> No, because it's essentially instant
[23:27:58] <abjorn> it's not an asynchronous operation
[23:28:14] <abjorn> or an event
[23:28:20] <fire> hmm i want to fadein a element after i added de <select> options via ajax
[23:28:47] <wkmanire> there is definitely a way to accomplish that. :)
[23:28:51] <fire> otherwise the select field loads and will be displayed before its completly filled
[23:29:09] <amirite> fire, then do it
[23:29:17] <abjorn> $("someselector").html(blablabla, blablabla);
[23:29:17] <abjorn> doFadeShitAwFuckYeahBuddy();
[23:30:00] <wkmanire> abjorn: Why do I get the impression that you really do name your functions that way.
[23:30:04] <fire> i do this, but doFade() is executed before .html() is complete
[23:30:13] <abjorn> because I do
[23:30:21] <wkmanire> :D You must be awesome to work with.
[23:30:27] <abjorn> you know it buddy
[23:30:43] <wkmanire> fire: As an expriment try setting a timeOut to do the fade in.
[23:30:54] <wkmanire> That should give your browser time to reflow the DOM.
[23:30:59] <wkmanire> Literally 1ms should be enough.
[23:31:06] <fire> hmm ok
[23:31:07] <abjorn> http://imgur.com/gallery/R87jN Bill FUCKIN Murray
[23:31:09] <wkmanire> experiment*
[23:31:36] <wkmanire> Lost in translation is my favorite bill murray movie.
[23:31:44] <fire> but it is not always the same time the ajax call needs to load the data.. sometimes it loaded 10 entries, sometimes it loads 200 entries
[23:32:09] <wkmanire> fire: That doesn't matter at all, don't set the timeout until after your ajax has completed and you have set the DOM.
[23:32:17] <abjorn> im gonna have to go with ghostbusters, wkmanire
[23:32:21] <fire> ok thank you
[23:32:25] <abjorn> ZUUUUUUUUL
[23:32:34] <wkmanire> Ghost Busters didn't have Scarlett Johansson.
[23:32:56] <abjorn> you make a good point
[23:35:51] <wkmanire> abjorn: Have you ever used https://github.com/jakobo/sslac?
[23:36:31] <wkmanire> I'm considering different OOP libraries. This one has a sort of interface enforcement concept which I like.
[23:38:24] <abjorn> Hm, no
[23:38:28] <abjorn> seems too complex in my opinion
[23:38:45] <abjorn> I never liked the level of complexity and sophisticated that OOP languages like Java give you
[23:38:50] <abjorn> *sophistication
[23:39:00] <wkmanire> You can abstract yourself into oblivion.
[23:39:16] <wkmanire> What did Ryan Dahl say? Be careful when you make abstractions because you may have to use them.
[23:39:18] <wkmanire> Something like that.
[23:39:22] <abjorn> Something like jresig's simple inheritance: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/ is perfect I think
[23:39:30] <abjorn> yeah i remember that lol
[23:39:48] <wkmanire> We're getting ready to convert an administration site with like 30 forms in it into a single page app on top of backbone.
[23:39:52] <abjorn> I think there's no reason to go any more sophisticated than what he has there
[23:40:08] <abjorn> lol have fun with that
[23:40:15] <abjorn> backbone is neato though so it shouldn't be too painful
[23:40:23] <wkmanire> I have a feeling that a little classical OOP will help with organization.
[23:40:44] <abjorn> Ehh, I don't know, backbone really already has everything you need for that
[23:41:01] <raulagrait> does anybody know if the recent change to remove back buttons by default off jquery mobile headers also removed dialog header close buttons by default?
[23:41:13] <wkmanire> Yeah, if everything is a model, view or controller you can extend away.
[23:41:22] <abjorn> lol true
[23:41:33] <abjorn> but it just uses the backbone extend anyways, so you could use that
[23:41:39] <abjorn> but it's not a lot
[23:42:06] <wkmanire> We'll probably just take a big bite out of the app then take a break to see if an OOP refactoring would be beneficial.
[23:42:19] <wkmanire> Thanks for being a good sounding board.
[23:42:39] <wkmanire> and for the Resig link.
[23:42:44] <abjorn> :p
[23:42:58] <abjorn> I use that simple inheritance thing quite a bit when I wanna do something a little more with OOP in js
[23:43:20] <wkmanire> Really, the only bit of magic is the super functions.
[23:43:24] <wkmanire> Thats the hardest thing to do right.
[23:43:31] <wkmanire> In my opinion anyway.
[23:43:37] <abjorn> he managed to do it in like
[23:43:41] <abjorn> a couple lines
[23:43:42] <abjorn> lol
[23:43:47] <abjorn> of course, he's john resig so...
[23:44:00] <wkmanire> Yeah, he's a real fart smeller.
[23:44:05] <abjorn> lolll
[23:44:06] <wkmanire> smart feller*
[23:44:33] <abjorn> I instantly thought of the south park episode with the hybrid cars
[23:44:45] * wkmanire grins.
[23:47:20] <abjorn> http://imgur.com/gallery/jXsmW good god I hope I marry a woman who will let me do something this awesome
[23:48:08] <wkmanire> abjorn: Nice!
[23:48:35] <wkmanire> Man, Resig really has a thing for mixing regular expressions and turnary expressions.
[23:49:03] <wkmanire> I tried to understand the jQuery tokenizing regex .... for about 45 seconds.
[23:49:13] <Sirisian> How do I do something as simple as var canvas = document.createElement("canvas"); this code doesn't return the element $(document).append("canvas")
[23:49:19] <wkmanire> I sure wish there was a verbose mode documented version of it.
[23:50:03] <abjorn> yeaaah he does do that
[23:51:55] <wkmanire> Sirisian: var $canv = $( "<canvas></canvas>" ); $( "body" ).append( $canv );
[23:51:59] <wkmanire> Something like that would probably work.
[23:52:15] <wkmanire> or just $( body ).append( $canv );
[23:52:50] <Sirisian> ah okay. thanks
[23:54:22] <wkmanire> abjorn: That simple inheritance will work great. Enforcing an interface should be just a function or two as well which I can handle. Thanks again for the reference.
[23:54:48] <abjorn> no probs
[23:54:49] <abjorn> :p
[23:55:20] <wkmanire> 90MB to go on my Linux Mint 11 dl :D
[23:55:25] <wkmanire> THen I'm gonna be down for about 45 minutes.
[23:55:29] <wkmanire> :(
[23:57:51] <abjorn> linux mint is neato
[23:58:17] <wkmanire> I've been using it since 9. Really happy with it.
