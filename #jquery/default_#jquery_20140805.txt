[00:01:29] <mkl1525> sacho, thanks for the help just realised that the example misses the "http:" in front of the jquery libs, after fixing this it works
[00:02:32] <Uhkis> that shouldn't be a problem..
[00:04:08] <mkl1525> Uhkis, chrome dev tools shows a "(failed)
[00:04:08] <mkl1525> net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND" with all links missing the http (site needs some time to load until the timeout)
[00:05:02] <acidjazz> phiz_: i think thats wrong
[00:05:23] <Uhkis> mkl1525: well that is just weird
[00:05:25] <acidjazz> phiz_: no u are correct
[00:07:38] <Johnny_> Hi guys! Anybody know how to deal with the conflict problem of different jQuery version CSS?
[00:24:22] <tw2113> get yourself down to one version of jQuery loaded at a time
[00:29:11] <Johnny_> well i hoped so but our team is collaborating with various versions of jquery right now
[00:32:01] <newbiee> i cant sent to javascript channel messages
[01:32:00] <jak2000> hi all
[01:33:42] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/9446441   <-- 1) why when click on button(line 68) not add a row, eecute the action form: call to page: grabacaptura.jsp 2) why initially not add a row, see line: 48 wich is wrong? thanks
[01:43:17] <sitebase_> exit
[01:58:49] <Hausas> didn't know that '>' is immediate child. I thought it's the same as .find() :(
[01:58:56] <Hausas> I've never been so wrong in my life
[02:15:45] <didiergm> jquerymobile 1.4.x how to tell whether a page has already been enhanced
[02:35:11] <futzhu> i cannot open http://try.jquery.com/ is the server down?
[02:40:37] <Uhkis> works fine from here
[03:22:13] <delboy1978uk> Hi guys, I have a function which builds up some html. at one stage, it runs .get() to grab some more info, and it builds up a <ul> element. however, the html doesn't append to the html variable outwith the scope of the success function. how do i do that? http://pastie.org/9447153
[03:22:56] <delboy1978uk> i tried html += ul but when i returned html the stuff from within the .get() wasnt there
[03:23:29] <delboy1978uk> like this http://pastie.org/9447157
[03:24:06] <METEMEDO> thats dirty
[03:25:49] <delboy1978uk> help me out then bro, js aint my forte
[03:26:21] <jphase> yeah I guess "that's dirty" doesn't really help hehe
[03:26:32] <jphase> so you're concatenating a string of html firstly
[03:26:39] <METEMEDO> use var html = $('<h1>').text(row.name); ... then in .get() use: for() { html.append($('<img>').attr('src', '/img/1star.png')
[03:26:44] <METEMEDO> i was writing :D
[03:26:48] <jphase> oh hehe
[03:26:50] <jphase> long pause
[03:26:56] <jphase> you could also go the object route
[03:27:09] <jphase> as METEMEDO was saying
[03:27:28] <jphase> also, if you use .get and pass json as the type, you could just use .getJSON
[03:28:08] <delboy1978uk> thanks for the tips :-)
[03:29:17] <delboy1978uk> my main problem is that in the get success function, it can see html variable, and i say html += ul, and it console logs fine, but once the function completes, the next line, return html; the html doesnt have the ul added
[03:29:37] <METEMEDO> thats because its sync
[03:29:47] <delboy1978uk> oh yeah
[03:29:52] <METEMEDO> make the ajax sync
[03:29:58] <METEMEDO> i mean it's async, make it sync
[03:30:02] <delboy1978uk> you can do that?
[03:30:12] <jphase> yeah or just use a callback
[03:30:15] <delboy1978uk> awesome, but how lol?
[03:30:55] <delboy1978uk> like i say, JS aint my strong point, although i'm not too bad (i like to think)
[03:31:17] <METEMEDO> this is a function of mine
[03:31:18] <METEMEDO> http://pastie.org/9447178
[03:31:45] <METEMEDO> you must use $.ajax() to have access such settings
[03:31:48] <METEMEDO> to*
[03:31:53] <jphase> that's another advantage to using ajax yeah
[03:32:23] <delboy1978uk> great thanks, i'll play with that now!
[03:34:58] <delboy1978uk> yeehah, that works great!
[03:35:16] <delboy1978uk> .ajax() is the way forward then! :-D
[03:36:23] <Cryp71c> From inside an event binding, can you manually call all other event bindings? I need to prevent bubbling by "return false" but this prevents other event bindings from running.
[03:41:36] <METEMEDO> delboy1978uk: but i still recommend using the html builder
[03:42:09] <jphase> Cryp71c: use .stopPropagation() instead then perhaps
[03:42:21] <jphase> that will only stop bubbling rather than preventDefault() as well
[03:42:33] <METEMEDO> $('<div />').append($('<img />').attr('src', 'link/to/img.png'));
[03:48:19] <Cryp71c> jphase, .stopPropogation() won't affect bindings made with .on, .live, or .bind
[03:48:37] <jphase> correct - and don't use .live hehe
[03:48:52] <jphase> well actually sorry, I mispoke
[03:48:52] <Cryp71c> jphase, ajax website, so nothing but .on, unfortunately.
[03:49:02] <jphase> if you're getting it from bubbling, it will prevent that
[03:49:09] <Cryp71c> jphase, in any case, I found what I needed in going to the "parent" binding and checking the e.target
[03:49:56] <jphase> Cryp71c: if you have a click event on a parent, and you click the child, .stopPropagation() will prevent that parent event from firing
[03:50:09] <delboy1978uk> cheers METEMEDO
[03:50:15] <Cryp71c> jphase, $('child').on('click', function(e) { console.log('child'); e.stopPropogation(); }); $('parent').on('click', function(e) { console.log('parent'); }); Will result in 'child' and 'parent' in the console.
[03:50:18] <jphase> so if that's what you're looking for, that should be fine. returning false will basically call both .stopPropagation() and .preventDefault()
[03:50:36] <METEMEDO> delboy1978uk: cheers :D
[03:50:40] <Cryp71c> jphase, only when the child binding has return false will the console have only 'child' when clicking on the child element.
[03:50:57] <jphase> hmm, I can almost guarantee something is awry then Cryp71c
[03:50:57] <jphase> sec
[03:53:33] <jphase> Cryp71c: http://jsfiddle.net/j29au/
[03:53:35] <jphase> view console
[04:02:46] <Cryp71c> jphase, thanks, that's not the exhibited behavior I have; I'll investigate further.
[04:21:13] <Silmarilion> what does .val() return when input field is empty? null or an empty string?
[04:22:06] <jphase> Cryp71c: np. yeah I thought that sounded weird :\
[04:22:52] <jphase> Silmarilion: empty string
[04:24:42] <Silmarilion> jphase, tnx
[04:43:35] <delboy1978uk> how do i explode in javascript?
[04:43:40] <delboy1978uk> by comma
[04:45:39] <Woet> .split
[04:46:07] <lacrymology> why are window.innerWidth and $(window).width() different (.width() is smaller)
[04:46:09] <lacrymology> >
[04:46:09] <lacrymology> ?
[04:47:04] <Woet> because they're different?
[04:47:12] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/innerwidth/
[04:47:12] <Woet> http://api.jquery.com/width/
[04:51:35] <morfin> hm
[04:51:57] <morfin> $.proxy is just using bind internally?
[04:54:05] <morfin> and returns wrapper function which allows to run function in proper context
[04:58:52] <thomedy> hey im going to post a ajax load im doing and it only works wheni  dont include the selector... but ithe selector is int her and the selector works on my local machine
[04:59:38] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/4p2VL/
[04:59:44] <thomedy> is anyone here to look at that
[05:00:03] <thomedy> its alittle piece and most of everythign else works
[05:00:33] <lacrymology> Woet: thanks
[05:00:44] <lacrymology> ohh, right, box model
[05:02:22] <lacrymology> thomedy: in your example the html is empty, does this reflect your real code?
[05:02:36] <thomedy> not at all... but i was trying to keep it simple
[05:02:44] <thomedy> in fact its  fair amount of html
[05:02:47] <thomedy> and php
[05:02:50] <thomedy> blah blah blah
[05:02:56] <thomedy> that just loads the page
[05:03:13] <thomedy> let me put in the page it loads... though it only moderately affects the fiddle
[05:03:19] <z3yo> What kind of JS event Facebook is using when they detect if you've seen a message or not?
[05:03:45] <lacrymology> z3yo: just guessing, but focus on the text?
[05:04:05] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/4p2VL/1/
[05:04:37] <thomedy> so it grabs the ajax_scroll_lock element and then pulls that in
[05:04:46] <thomedy> the rest is there for a fallback when its sans javascript
[05:04:51] <z3yo> lacrymology, when you are on the page "All my messages", chatting with a person, they set seen automatically do you think?
[05:05:28] <lacrymology> thomedy: I can't find #ajaxed_content in your html
[05:05:53] <thomedy> oh right cuz i loaded the page that it grabs ajaxed_content is the one it goes into...
[05:06:00] <thomedy> umm.m.. let me grab a snippet one sec
[05:06:30] <lacrymology> z3yo: no clue.. try it?
[05:06:49] <thomedy>  http://jsfiddle.net/4p2VL/2/
[05:06:50] <z3yo> lacrymology, yeah I'm gonna inspect
[05:07:22] <z3yo> lacrymology, I'm sure it's interesting to see all the events facebook use :) thx for your help
[05:08:58] <ChoboBill> hi, how do I create a new object without specifying person1, instead it would increment by itself?
[05:09:11] <ChoboBill> e.g. person1 = .... person2 =...
[05:09:30] <lacrymology> thomedy: so, since I can't run your code, I can't tell you what's wrong out of the blue. But what you can do is to place some breakpoints on what's line 1 in your snippet, and check what does $("#ajaxed_content") return if anything, and also inside the callbacks
[05:09:46] <lacrymology> debug that thing
[05:10:00] <thomedy> let me do this.. unrelated because my code is pretty long
[05:10:13] <thomedy> ill just make my own little version and if it returns right this time... i dont know what to say
[05:10:27] <thomedy> but i have never done break points so that would be ajourney all to itself
[05:10:33] <lacrymology> ChoboBill: what kind of object would that be?
[05:10:41] <ChoboBill> for a person object
[05:11:10] <ChoboBill> I have a method call addPerson, but I don't what to specify person1 when calling the method
[05:11:23] <thomedy> hwo do i break point
[05:11:29] <lacrymology> thomedy: just press F12 in your browser (I prefer webkit based ones for development) go to the sources section, find your bit of code and click on the gray area on the left of the code
[05:11:29] <thomedy> im assuming you mean firebug
[05:11:35] <lacrymology> a blue or red dot will appear
[05:11:38] <ChoboBill> i want it so when calling the method and adding a new person, the object name would just increment by itself
[05:11:48] <lacrymology> thomedy: with firebug it should be similar, but I havent used it in ages
[05:12:13] <lacrymology> ChoboBill: is there a selector you can use to get the other persons?
[05:13:15] <lacrymology> ChoboBill: you could do something like $("person").length()+1 or $("person").last().data("person-id") or something like that
[05:13:53] <lacrymology> is this a DOM element?
[05:14:07] <lacrymology> a <div class="person" id="person2"> kind of thing?
[05:14:33] <thomedy> got em
[05:14:36] <ChoboBill> lacrymology: sorry for not clarifying, no this is not a DOM element.
[05:14:52] <ChoboBill> larymology: im doing this with pure js
[05:14:58] <lacrymology> ChoboBill: and how does jQuery come into play?
[05:15:21] <ChoboBill> I couldn't get onto JS irc, I thought jQuery irc might be able to help
[05:15:50] <Uhkis> ChoboBill: ##javascript  ?
[05:15:51] <lacrymology> you probably need to register your nick
[05:16:43] <lacrymology> ChoboBill: anyways, you'll have to either pass the number as a parameter or keep a global counter. I'd avoid the global at all costs
[05:16:49] <thomedy> these break points arent giving me any information... im not sure what im looking for
[05:16:56] <ChoboBill> hi
[05:17:30] <lacrymology> thomedy: before the load call is made, check if your selector $("#ajax_loaded") or whatever it was, returns something
[05:18:23] <lacrymology> Check the URL you're constructing, that it's correct, put breakpoints inside the callbacks as well to make sure they're getting called, and check whether you're doing the right thing inside them
[05:18:55] <lacrymology> evaluate the values of the dynamic parameters to any calls and look for anything that looks wrong
[05:19:24] <lacrymology> thomedy: but since you say that without the selector the call works, I'm guessing the div doesn't yet exist somehow
[05:19:57] <thomedy> yeah but the really weird part is that on some calls it does call the selector...
[05:20:08] <thomedy> and not only that each page is dynamically created with the same php
[05:20:10] <thomedy> so wtf
[05:20:15] <thomedy> its  riddle
[05:21:00] <lacrymology> thomedy: that's why you debug it
[05:21:06] <thomedy> yeah...
[05:21:11] <thomedy> im gonna get it..
[05:21:11] <lacrymology> to figure out WHAT it is that is different
[05:21:13] <thomedy> debug time
[05:21:22] <thomedy> i didn't think it was my ajax
[05:21:25] <thomedy> its just confusing me right now
[05:21:36] <lacrymology> thomedy: if you have a live link I can try to help you a few minutes
[05:21:48] <thomedy> well i do... giv me one sec
[05:21:56] <thomedy> oh you kno wwhat
[05:21:58] <thomedy> i have to go to work
[05:22:09] <lacrymology> ok, good luck
[05:22:17] <thomedy> so it wont be a wise decision for me to continue this right now.. thanks anyway .... ill be back
[05:26:36] <ratbuddy__> sorry if this is too noobish, I'm using ajax and jquery to change a product page href link after a user selects from a dropdown - I'm going to use load() to put the new data 'under' the link. Is there a way to only change the href and not the link text or other stuff in the span?
[05:27:23] <ratbuddy__> something like $('#span_id').load("href=the_link"); would be splendid but I don't see it in the docs
[05:46:22] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: nope, but you can do $.get(url, data, function() { $("#span_id").attr('href', value); });
[05:47:55] <ratbuddy__> hmm, $('#show_sizechart_link').hide(); works properly
[05:48:06] <ratbuddy__> but when I change to $('#show_sizechart_link').prop("href", "/csvtest.php?"+alloy+form+".csv"); it does not change as desired
[05:48:42] <ratbuddy__> thanks for the answer btw lacrymology
[05:49:56] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: .attr()
[05:49:58] <lacrymology> not .prop()
[05:50:47] <ratbuddy__> tried that too :) will try again
[05:51:04] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: .prop() is for checked, or disabled, stuff like that
[05:51:33] <ratbuddy__> ahh.. just trying to change the underlying href of a single element (#show_sizechart_link)
[05:51:38] <decx> prop is for direct manipulation of the property of an element
[05:51:42] <ratbuddy__> without reloading the page
[05:52:04] <decx> and prop href would work just fine
[05:52:07] <ratbuddy__> I can get it to fire with hide() when the desired trigger event happens, but the link isn't changing
[05:52:20] <lacrymology> decx: ok, I thought they were different
[05:52:34] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: $("#show_sizechart_link").attr('href', new_value) should work
[05:53:09] <lacrymology> assuming <a id="show_sizechart_link" href="something">
[05:53:17] <decx> attr is for manipulating your markup, prop is probably always preferable
[05:53:49] <lacrymology> decx: would you explain what does "your markup" mean there?
[05:53:58] <lacrymology> i mean, what's the difference?
[05:54:32] <decx> the markup is just what is used to generate the dom
[05:54:55] <decx> so <div class="blah"></div> becomes an element with many different properties
[05:55:14] <ratbuddy__> <span id="show_sizechart_link" style="float:left; display:inline; padding-right: 1em; width: 32em; font-size: .65em;"><a href="/csvtest.php" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">Available Dimensions</a><font color="red">*   </font>Dimension listing is for reference only. If you do not see the size you need, choose "I want to specify dimensions."</span>
[05:55:35] <ratbuddy__> that is the element I'm trying to change, just trying to change /csvtest.php to something else when a dropdown elsewhere is changed
[05:55:48] <decx> you want to change these properties directly, while attr has probably built in things to normalize the behaviour, prop is just more direct
[05:55:52] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: you're changing the span, not the <a>, how do you expect it to work?
[05:56:16] <ratbuddy__> I don't know, hide() worked so I assumed I had the right target
[05:56:20] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: then do $(#show_sizechart_link > a").prop('href', value)
[05:56:37] <lacrymology> ratbuddy__: if you hide the parent, the children disappear as well, of course ;)
[05:56:45] <ratbuddy__> ohh
[05:56:59] <lacrymology> how I love mixing double and single quotes. I wish I could disconver what's the logic I follow
[05:57:04] <Jagst3r21> any idea why this spinner is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/g84Zq/
[05:57:21] <decx> i use double quotes in html and css, and single quotes in js
[05:57:39] <ratbuddy__> I do perl where single vs double matters :(
[05:57:41] <decx> and everyone who does it otherwise is an idiot and a savage
[05:57:44] <decx> ^^
[05:58:12] <Jagst3r21> im using this fgnass.github.com/spin.js#v2.0.1
[05:58:28] <lacrymology> decx: I don't usually develop jquery html or css. But I do the same thing in python. I think in my case it's got to do with the length of the strings, or whether I had to press SHIFT just before the quote
[05:58:34] <decx> the hell is that supposed to spin?
[05:58:38] <lacrymology> so $(" but a + 'foo'
[05:59:12] <Jagst3r21> decx wehat?
[06:00:34] <Jagst3r21> what*
[06:01:12] <decx> i dont get what you're are trying to spin here
[06:01:31] <Jagst3r21> before the image loads
[06:01:36] <ratbuddy__> worked, thanks so much!
[06:02:30] <decx> never going to work
[06:02:34] <morfin> hmm
[06:02:50] <lacrymology> decx: there was a very informative answer in StackOverflow about attr vs prop, by the way
[06:02:54] <morfin> jQuery assumes that if i specify type "script" it's safe?
[06:03:08] <Jagst3r21> decx it will never work? :(
[06:04:16] <morfin> so if some_bad_admin will add something like steal_cookies_and_kill_user(); jQuery will just eval that
[06:25:04] <xxx1337> Here is a jquery problem I have anyone think they can figure it out? http://jsfiddle.net/S5E7d/2/
[06:25:53] <xxx1337> When I say keep the padding to the top and bottom I mean padding on the scroll bar
[06:26:02] <xxx1337> so it doesn't touch the border
[06:28:30] <xxx1337> I've updated my jsfiddle to be a bit more clear http://jsfiddle.net/S5E7d/3/
[06:31:15] <airdem> xxx1337, did you try the suppressScrollY option?
[06:32:16] <decx> perfect scrollbar my ass
[06:32:51] <airdem> :)
[06:33:08] <xxx1337> airdem: no, but i'd have to think of a clever way to only find the scrollboxes that don't have overflow
[06:33:14] <airdem> xxtjaxx, http://jsfiddle.net/S5E7d/4/
[06:33:37] <airdem> http://jsfiddle.net/S5E7d/5/
[06:33:43] <airdem> this is the correct version ... :)
[06:34:03] <xxx1337> closer but
[06:34:06] <xxx1337> i cant simply do :last
[06:34:11] <airdem> xxtjaxx,  why not use the browser standard scrollbars?
[06:34:14] <airdem> xxx1337,
[06:34:17] <decx> oh i know, you get rid of that less than perfect scrollbar doohickey and use overflow: auto
[06:34:25] <airdem> :)
[06:34:33] <xxx1337> lol
[06:34:38] <airdem> he right imo
[06:34:41] <airdem> *he's
[06:34:44] <decx> also https://github.com/jnicol/trackpad-scroll-emulator
[06:35:46] <airdem> xxx1337, overflow: auto; is a css property if you didnt knew it already
[06:35:58] <xxx1337> i know
[06:36:04] <xxx1337> i want perfect scroll bar tho
[06:36:19] <decx> tse falls back to overflow auto
[06:36:22] <xxx1337> is there a way to count the p tags in a class?
[06:36:26] <xxx1337> in jquery
[06:36:55] <airdem> $('p') will return an array containing all matches
[06:37:21] <xxx1337> I mean count the number of elements in a class
[06:37:34] <xxx1337> like this? var numItems = $('.yourclass').length
[06:38:06] <airdem> http://api.jquery.com/size/
[06:38:14] <decx> size is deprecated
[06:38:21] <airdem> length also works, right
[06:41:18] <Jagst3r21> ok, I got a spinner working, but I am not sure why it wont stop: http://dev.semgeeks.com:8888/gothamist/nike/
[06:41:31] <Jagst3r21> if u click on the image it will work
[06:44:12] <Jagst3r21> apparantly, "If you need to stop it then you need to save the instance of new Spinner to a variable and then call the stop method."
[06:44:29] <Jagst3r21> not sure how to do that D:
[06:44:31] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: so, are you doing that?
[06:44:45] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: spinner = new Spinner(bla bla bla);
[06:44:49] <lacrymology> and afterwards
[06:44:53] <lacrymology> spinner.stop()
[06:45:09] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: also, that's not jQuery AFAICS, ##javascript?
[06:45:27] <Jagst3r21> I have: $('#ads').after(new Spinner(opts).spin().el);
[06:45:58] <Jagst3r21> ^lacrymology
[06:46:16] <Jagst3r21> so i used jQuery to get the spinner loaded
[06:46:24] <Jagst3r21> but not sure how to make it stop XD
[06:46:42] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: as I said above
[06:47:01] <lacrymology> do spinner = new Spinner(opts).spin();
[06:47:12] <lacrymology> $('#ads').after(spinner.el)
[06:47:19] <lacrymology> and keep that variable around to delete it afterwards
[06:47:31] <lacrymology> and do a basic javascript tutorial, too
[06:47:45] <Jagst3r21> i will
[06:48:33] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: actually, if you do var spinner = new Spinner(.... the variable will be local, and if you do just spinner = new Spinner(..... it'll be global
[06:48:47] <lacrymology> using globals is generally a bad idea, but at this point...
[06:50:45] <Jagst3r21> lacrymology I tried this, any idea why its not working? http://hastebin.com/ovebuzufur.js
[06:51:04] <lacrymology> if I call $.ajaxSetup({sync: false}) before a call to .load(), this will be synchronous, right?
[06:51:38] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: because it's wrong
[06:51:47] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: can't say anything more than that
[06:51:54] <Jagst3r21> ok :/
[06:51:59] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: I could give you something similar that *might* work
[06:52:05] <donni> can someone please give an example on how to use ajax to query a data from database when the trigger is changed?
[06:53:10] <Jagst3r21> lacrymology, can I see it?
[06:53:39] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: http://hastebin.com/umajetusew.coffee here's some problems about your code pointed out
[06:55:20] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: what is target?
[06:55:38] <Jagst3r21> u mean the div its targeting?
[06:55:59] <lacrymology> no, you do $(target).data(...)
[06:56:01] <lacrymology> what is that target?
[06:56:28] <Jagst3r21> spinner I guess
[06:56:29] <Vivekananda_y510> hi everyone
[06:57:16] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: where do you define it? where does it come from?
[06:57:22] <lacrymology> nah
[06:57:26] <Jagst3r21> i dont think i defined it
[06:57:56] <Jagst3r21> im seeing spinner is not defined
[06:58:11] <jj2> Hello. Any idea why the click event is not triggered after .b is attached? http://jsfiddle.net/h2AU3/1/
[06:59:41] <Jagst3r21> then when I add var spinner = new Spinner().spin(target);
[06:59:46] <Jagst3r21> I get target is not defined
[07:03:37] <Jagst3r21> lacrymology I am honestly not sure what the answer to this is: what is that spinner variable? it's undefined! what's target? what's its relation to ads?
[07:13:14] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: wtf is target?
[07:13:14] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: why do you expect it to magically exist if you don't define it?
[07:13:14] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: against my better judgement, here's two versions that might work, http://hastebin.com/izepoyacec.coffee
[07:13:14] <lacrymology> Jagst3r21: I still don't understand what you expect the 'target' variable to be
[07:18:13] <airdem> shouldnt new FormData (this) collect all input data inside a forms submit event?
[07:19:43] <airdem> all i get is  FormData { append=append()} from a console.log()
[07:20:26] <Vivekananda_y510> anyone care for a little drupal help. I am on their site too but it is slow/down for some reason
[07:21:45] <BillCriswell> airdem: Can you just use $.serializeArray() ?
[07:23:12] <BillCriswell> airdem: You can do var data = $(this).serializeArray(); and that'll give you the form data in an array like [{"name":"name", "value":"airdm"}, ...]
[07:27:22] <shanee> Hello, I have a string of html stored in a variable and would like to take an element of it and then modify that element with jquery before saving the new html back into the string. Can I do this?
[07:28:53] <BillCriswell> shanee: Yeah, var html = '<div><strong>Foo</strong></div>', $html = $(html); $html.find('strong').addClass('foo'); html = $html[0].outerHTML;
[07:31:48] <shanee> BillCriswell, Ah. Awesome. Thank you. I think outerHTML is what I was mising
[07:32:20] <BillCriswell> shanee: Yeah, if outerHTML gives you trouble in browsers you can .wrap('<div>') then just return that .html()
[07:35:22] <BillCriswell> shanee: Also, another situation you might run into is trying to alter the root of the html in that. To get the <div> you'd need to use .filter('div') and not .find('div'), I see that throw a lot of people off.
[07:42:29] <BillCriswell> Brain hurts.
[07:51:34] <cannap> hi can any tell me why this is not working http://jsfiddle.net/3VT3e/21/ i want the new added class via regex
[07:54:32] <BillCriswell> cannap: You don't quote regular expressions.
[07:55:17] <cannap> thxx
[07:55:23] <shanee> BillCriswell, Thank you. That's very helpful.
[07:56:57] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:57:22] <cannap> http://jsfiddle.net/3VT3e/25/ why shows me this the class double?
[07:58:23] <BillCriswell> cannap: You should be doing console.log(match) to get more details, but it's showing 2 because of the ( and ) in your regular expression.
[07:58:58] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/3VT3e/28/
[07:59:00] <Hausas> Is there a way to find out what function was called after I pressed a button?
[07:59:32] <BinaryKitten> cannap string.match returns an array
[08:01:29] <cannap> kk thx for this infos :D
[08:01:54] <BillCriswell> Hausas: arguments.callee.name could do it.
[08:02:14] <BillCriswell> Hausas: http://jsbin.com/wopadeya/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:02:51] <BillCriswell> Hausas: That's forbidden in strict mode aparently.
[08:05:18] <Hausas> BillCriswell: I'm trying to use Chrome Dev tools' Profiles
[08:05:29] <Hausas> But it's not sorted by the time it was called
[08:05:38] <Hausas> I't sorted by the time it took to execute
[08:05:44] <ds7> hi
[08:06:12] <BillCriswell> Hausas: Okie doke.
[08:06:18] <ds7> Does anybody know how the audio player works on this site: http://www.hardwax.com ?
[08:06:49] <ds7> I'm looking for something like that or similar.
[08:06:49] <BillCriswell> ds7: It literally just goes to the file and lets the browser handle it.
[08:07:25] <BillCriswell> Oh, after I allow it haha
[08:09:43] <BillCriswell> ds7: It looks like hey generate the backgrounds server side (https://hardwax.com/audio/71183_A1.png) then the player uses CSS and JS to run through.
[08:11:14] <AlexRussia> Hi folks, help me: i want organize something like AJAX, but on JSON, how i could do it? @_@
[08:11:35] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia you can use JSON instead of XML - same basic concept.
[08:11:41] <BillCriswell> ds7: Maybe even just CSS depending which browsers you'd want to support.
[08:12:13] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: sorry, i am something noob in it, what you mean? @_@
[08:12:43] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: i just only start learning js and jquery, i understand AJAX idea, but i never tried it :(
[08:13:21] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia you can use jquery's $.ajax() to fetch almost anything - the kind of data is almost irrelevant.
[08:14:38] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: then 'var lol = $.ajax('/users.json')' return me string which i could parse as json ?
[08:15:04] <ds7> BillCriswell: ok, thank you
[08:15:05] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia if that file is valid json, you just use it as such.
[08:15:20] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: then .get return just text?
[08:15:41] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: and, if is it, how i could send data? @_@
[08:15:52] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia don't wrap it in quotes and you're goldon. also - you don't just set a var to that function.  it's more like $.ajax('/users.json').done(function(data){ /* now use the data here */ });
[08:16:19] <robertmaxrees> if you want more info, check out learn.jquery.com - there's an entire section on ajax.
[08:16:42] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: who is goldon? @_@
[08:17:05] <robertmaxrees> err, "golden".  and I mean to say that it's not a string as long as you don't wrap the response in quotes from the server.
[08:17:06] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: oh, seems nice!
[08:18:53] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: you mean $.ajax('/users.json').done(function(data){ var data_string = "" + data + ""; }); sth like that? @_@
[08:19:04] <airdem> <BillCriswell> thank you for  $.serializeArray() i totally forgot about it
[08:19:18] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia except you wouldn't just concat the data in - if the data in JSON you'd want to parse it first.
[08:19:30] <robertmaxrees> you'd treat the returned data like any other object.
[08:20:06] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: oh....
[08:20:18] <scri66le> anyone know how to hide a element based on input name and value? http://pastebin.com/6ESz6UBR
[08:21:13] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ...
[08:21:13] <robertmaxrees> scri66le you want to test if an input has a given name and value?  or if an input with a given name has a particular value?
[08:21:20] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: what is data @_@ ?
[08:21:23] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:21:38] <scri66le> I have several inputs with the same name but different values, and I want ot hide one based on it's value
[08:21:45] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: oh, i found
[08:21:46] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia the data that comes back from the server.  redad the ajax tutorial on learn.jquery.com
[08:21:53] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: yeyeye
[08:22:08] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: we have $.getJSON() and $.post()
[08:22:31] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia you can use those as well - those actually use $.ajax() themselves.
[08:22:57] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: yep
[08:23:05] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: $.post() send data?
[08:23:31] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia yes - please read the documentation.
[08:24:11] <scri66le> I have several inputs with the same name but different values, and I want ot hide one based on it's value robertmaxrees
[08:24:39] <robertmaxrees> scri66le you'll have to .each() through all those inputs with that name attribute and test its value
[08:28:37] <alester> When I'm doing an appendTo to send data to an alternate element in autocomplete, do I need to do something to make the default menu NOT show up?
[08:31:09] <robertmaxrees> scri66le that make sense?
[08:31:48] <scri66le> robertmaxrees, like this -> http://pastebin.com/zyub0UVz
[08:32:14] <robertmaxrees> you want either this.value or $(this).val();
[08:32:27] <robertmaxrees> the vanilla this object doesn't have the jquery methods attached.
[08:32:36] <robertmaxrees> fixee.org/paste/pg588mt/
[08:32:49] <robertmaxrees> also, no need to pass that parameter to the function.
[08:33:23] <alester> I'm setting up an autocomplete that sends data to a certain div, but for some reason the div doesn't show the <ul> that gets sent, and the regular popup shows up anyway. https://gist.github.com/petdance/8f461a266043d8f81db9
[08:34:18] <scri66le> awesome robertmaxrees . Thanks a million
[08:34:27] <alester> (reposted with correct indenting)
[08:36:10] <robertmaxrees> scri66le is it at all posible for you to make a working jsfiddle with dummy data?
[08:37:06] <scri66le> sure
[08:42:40] <scri66le> worked for my page but not working so on fiddle robertmaxrees -> http://jsfiddle.net/3k4X6/1/
[08:43:25] <robertmaxrees> woops i'm so sorry - that was meant for somebody else hahahahaha.  sorry to have you waste your time.  the simple fix would have been to include jquery though =(
[08:43:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/3k4X6/3/
[08:43:41] <robertmaxrees> i feel like a jackass now.
[08:43:50] <MikeD_> .on('click','input', f() ) <-- does that fire if someone clicks on the label for a radio/checkbox?
[08:44:00] <pampuchy> hi, on my server i have a txt file with a list of image URLs. i would like to display these images on a web page, one every second - how to do so?
[08:44:04] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ nope.
[08:44:53] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy load the text file and enumerate through it, create an array of images and append one every second.
[08:46:19] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: is there a similar example you can please point me to
[08:46:44] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy not really.  if you're new to jquery, i'd start at learn.jquery.com
[08:47:19] <MikeD_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/s26a2/
[08:49:25] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ ah, yeah
[08:49:33] <robertmaxrees> if you use the for attribute it'll work.
[08:49:45] <MikeD_> i know, i should have done that instead of asking about it :)
[08:49:48] <dglambert> so I am using get to get a page, but in that page I am also using get
[08:49:49] <robertmaxrees> hah
[08:49:53] <dglambert> the second get is not working
[08:50:11] <MikeD_> I've never trusted labels without the for attribute
[08:50:17] <dglambert> nevermind I think its cors
[08:51:09] <robertmaxrees> dglambert that's a really strange thing to do.
[08:51:22] <dglambert> whys that
[08:51:32] <robertmaxrees> you're ajaxing in a page that's running an ajax call.
[08:51:34] <dglambert> I'm loading a page that has an ajax call
[08:51:55] <robertmaxrees> right - that's a strange thing to do.  why not just load in the data you want?
[08:53:53] <dglambert> so its not live so I can't show you
[08:54:00] <dglambert> but I have built a widget
[08:54:13] <dglambert> thats hosted on a page tourmatters.com/widget
[08:54:18] <dglambert> (not actually there)
[08:54:39] <dglambert> and from there the widget has a modal that has search functionality that I am pulling from another page
[08:54:49] <dglambert> say tourmatters.com/search
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> eeeehhh... don't do it that way.
[08:54:59] <robertmaxrees> abstract out your search instead.
[08:56:32] <pampuchy> i have a text file with a single URL in it, how do i pass it to an image href with jquery?
[08:56:34] <dglambert> hold pleas
[08:56:45] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy ajax it.
[08:56:59] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: i am looking at things like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6470567/jquery-load-txt-file-and-insert-into-div
[08:57:09] <dglambert> robertmaxrees, https://bjwpgg.bn1.livefilestore.com/y2pfKrnvUu3T_RmX1F0GhGAUJun4dc01XSIowuL26kNu3_ogKO3OUgw54RE4KXSXr5Mq-nfs7KTVnNOpT8JyicGKu_9eEJmR_exeNVGLnDvc7U/widget_01.JPG
[08:57:17] <pampuchy> but these things modify divs - i just want to modify the image href
[08:57:26] <dglambert> https://bjwpgg.bn1.livefilestore.com/y2p3H1_MYRkJakIItDn9inNgigDC8IKxZl0lLgbFJ79PIuuG4akhbszJuBqmcYmzsX-UFUOzv7cbWZtRbx3G-fPrRb3vgTUHiaRUWX3rqUm2Dk/widget_02.JPG
[08:57:28] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy then change the relevant part ;)
[08:57:35] <robertmaxrees> dglambert this isn't going to change my advice.
[08:57:47] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: an online example please?
[08:57:48] <dglambert> yeah I figured, I just wanted to give some context
[08:58:04] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy $('img').prop('src', yourURLHere)
[08:58:24] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy what you want to do won't have an "online example" because it's very basic - check out learn.jquery.com :)
[08:58:41] <dglambert> I'm gonna put it on our server soon, so I will probably come back and ask about your suggestions once I can share what I have
[08:58:48] <pampuchy> and the 'yourURLHere' part is simply the text file right?
[08:59:06] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy the "yourURLHere" part is a variable that contains the URL from your text file.
[08:59:54] <pampuchy> how do i pass my text to a variable
[09:00:11] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com will show you everything you need to know.
[09:00:15] <dglambert> I need to go grab my lunch, starving
[09:01:41] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy it'll look something like this, either way: http://fixee.org/paste/r83p62o/
[09:01:49] <robertmaxrees> check out the tutorial i linked.
[09:02:15] <pampuchy> thanks robertmaxrees !
[09:04:49] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: now instead of being triggered by a button or something, how do i make it happen when the page loads, and keep doing it every 1 second?
[09:05:24] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy don't run the logic inside of a click, and you'll want to iterate through an array you'll build from the text file.
[09:06:29] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: but my text file only has one line - no multiple lines! it updates every second though
[09:06:57] <robertmaxrees> pampuchy that's going to give you race conditions all over the place and be very fragile then.
[09:08:29] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: even so, how could i do it? i dont mind race and fragiltity
[09:10:01] <robertmaxrees> then run the ajax every second and update your image source.
[09:10:04] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic.
[09:10:13] <pampuchy> yes - how to do this?
[09:10:15] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript run function every second
[09:10:16] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: javascript - What's the easiest way to call a function every 5 seconds ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2170923/whats-the-easiest-way-to-call-a-function-every-5-seconds-in-jquery
[09:10:21] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[09:10:53] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: you are very kindly! merci!
[09:13:41] <pampuchy> robertmaxrees: why this dont work: http://bpaste.net/show/jIvGPav4NwGwBjkWkCyZ/
[09:19:48] <robertmaxrees> because your code isn't value.

[09:20:12] <delboy1978uk> hi guys
[09:21:08] <robertmaxrees> goooooood morning
[09:21:47] <delboy1978uk> i'm loading <li>'s with an <a> tag inside using ajax, but my $('a.classname').click(function(){//etc}); doesn't work as the elements were dynamically loaded afterwards. how do i get around this again!
[09:21:57] <robertmaxrees> event delegation.
[09:22:10] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {}0;
[09:22:15] <robertmaxrees> err $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[09:22:21] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell how's your morning going?
[09:22:49] <delboy1978uk> my morning has turned to dinner time! finishing in 8 mins :-)
[09:22:57] <robertmaxrees> hah
[09:23:11] <robertmaxrees> actually i guess it'd be around lunchtime for bill
[09:28:32] <delboy1978uk> i'm in scotland here
[09:31:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm in california here.
[09:32:10] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Good so far. Yours?
[09:32:37] <robertmaxrees> not too bad.
[09:34:10] <robertmaxrees> bugsquashin' today
[09:34:31] <BillCriswell> I'm css organizing. Makes me want to slam my head into a wall.
[09:34:56] <robertmaxrees> always the worst.
[09:35:29] <juslintek> Can someone tell me, why jquery, uploader is not working here as on other pages, can someone notice a conflict? http://www.pressline.lt/lt/ideti-skelbima
[09:37:53] <robertmaxrees> juslintek you have a lot of console errors - i'd fix those first.
[09:40:35] <juslintek> robertmaxrees)Don't know how to fix them, seems like jquery.min.js is causing them itself. jquery.ui.core.min.js
[09:40:39] <juslintek> as well
[09:40:46] <robertmaxrees> juslintek nope - those are all with your code.
[09:41:17] <juslintek> (robertmaxrees), Chrome console doesn't point them out.
[09:41:20] <ktb> hello! I want to count the number of rows in a table. So I gave TBODY a class name and since there are multiple tables displayed it also has an ID, which is just an integer (0,1,2,3,...). Everytime I click on a table I want to alert() the corresponding amount of rows, so I have $(".class_name").on("click", "tr", function() { var rows = $( ... ).length; alert(rows); }); . The reason I have dots
[09:41:20] <ktb> in the parentheses is because I don't know how to access the different IDs of the table. Any idea how to do this?
[09:42:18] <robertmaxrees> juslintek you think jquery would ship with a bunch of buggy code that'd just randomly throw a bunch of errors?
[09:42:24] <BillCriswell> ktb: Hard time following you there. Do you want the index of the one you clicked?
[09:43:16] <ktb> BillCriswell: no I want the number of total rows of the table the one I clicked corresponds to
[09:43:35] <BillCriswell> ktb: So just the amount of trs in a table?
[09:43:39] <ktb> yes
[09:44:16] <BillCriswell> I'd probably do $(this).closest('tbody').children().length
[09:44:30] <juslintek> (robertmaxrees), so how to debug that then?
[09:44:53] <ktb> BillCriswell: OK thanks!
[09:45:23] <robertmaxrees> juslintek start with errors that emit from your code and go from there.
[09:46:20] <juslintek> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined jquery.min.js:2

[09:46:50] <robertmaxrees> also, it's a big help if you put your js in separate files.
[09:47:42] <juslintek> its minified jquery, unreadable, unless I want my eyes to break...
[09:47:48] <robertmaxrees> again
[09:47:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery is not broken on that page.
[09:47:55] <robertmaxrees> your code is.
[09:48:17] <juslintek> But chrome points out to jquery.min.js
[09:48:34] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're passing things to jquery that then breaks.
[09:48:48] <adv_> i'm using http://www.jacklmoore.com/wheelzoom/ on a rotated image with jquery-rotate, it messes up because height/width are inversed or something. tried inversing them, it's not that easy , any ideas ?
[09:49:00] <robertmaxrees> made sure you're passing the right kinds of objects around.
[09:50:07] <juslintek> (robertmaxrees) Seems like Chrome console is broken. points out css and stuff like that, which has nothing to do with js
[09:50:50] <robertmaxrees> that's legit.
[09:52:04] <BillCriswell> Errors never seem to lead to where I expect them to lol.
[09:53:23] <juslintek> I think some php values are not printed, probably thats why js is sick. dang...
[10:14:21] <itsrachelfish> Hi #jQuery, how come the docs say .selector was removed in jQuery v1.9, but in v1.10 and v1.11 I can still see it?
[10:14:23] <itsrachelfish> http://api.jquery.com/selector/
[10:17:33] <BillCriswell> itsrachelfish: Noticed that the other day. Not sure.
[10:19:22] <BillCriswell> Maybe they tried to remove it and it broke something and they said fuck it.
[10:19:58] <itsrachelfish> haha
[10:21:14] <robertmaxrees> "The .selector property was deprecated in jQuery 1.7 and is only maintained to the extent needed for supporting .live() in the jQuery Migrate plugin."
[10:21:36] <BillCriswell> Did you read the documentation showoff?
[10:21:41] <robertmaxrees> duh
[10:21:45] <robertmaxrees> i read the page that was linked.
[10:21:47] <robertmaxrees> lolol
[10:22:15] <BillCriswell> I like to make things up blindly though!
[10:22:29] <robertmaxrees> you weren't too far off, to be fair
[10:27:20] <BillCriswell> 8-)
[10:29:42] <BillCriswell> Hm.. finally looking into this "widget factory" stuff a bit.
[10:31:26] <adv_> i have var foo = document.querySelector("#galleria"); and there is a class="galleria" in my html but it tells me it's null :/
[10:31:29] <adv_> any ideas?
[10:31:30] <AlexRussia> heh, for me http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/ is better introduction in js, ty :D
[10:31:42] <BillCriswell> adv_: # is for ids, not classes.
[10:31:57] <AlexRussia> # is probabily id
[10:32:04] <BillCriswell> You probably want .galleria, or since you're in jQuery $('.galleria')
[10:32:18] <AlexRussia> adv_: ye,he right
[10:34:32] <adv_> hm thanks
[10:37:47] <PantsOfChoco> jquery peeps
[10:38:13] <PantsOfChoco> when i try to run refresh on a slider it never works has anyone encountered this? it says that slider has no method refresh?
[10:38:25] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ PantsOfChoco
[10:38:26] <b-ot> PantsOfChoco: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:41:05] <robertmaxrees> usually that error means you're targeting the wrong element.
[10:41:28] <PantsOfChoco> ugh im so bad at javascript this takes me forever to get working in fiddle haha
[10:41:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/886J9/ add in your simplified html and js ;)
[10:44:03] <PantsOfChoco> http://jsfiddle.net/886J9/
[10:44:12] <robertmaxrees> need to hit "update".
[10:44:26] <PantsOfChoco> JUST MAKE ME FEEL DUMBER DONT YA! hahaha
[10:44:32] <PantsOfChoco> http://jsfiddle.net/886J9/1/
[10:44:32] <robertmaxrees> hah it's all good man.
[10:49:36] <phoenixsun> what is a google way of creating two way binding for a seeker bar?
[10:49:37] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting that method name from?
[10:49:43] <phoenixsun> good way I mean
[10:49:58] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco - because i'm not seeing it but i'm blind sometimes.
[10:50:22] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun a framework or library like riot.js
[10:51:39] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: I guess its Angular its pretty single but since I dont want to make that move atm I will have a look at riot.js
[10:51:52] <phoenixsun> in Angular its pretty simple I mean
[10:52:07] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun riot's a lot smaller and does what it does without the extra weight of angular.
[10:54:04] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: ok I will try it because I like my current seeker bar design and the only way I know how to two way input it is if I use an old school <input type="range'> then it will look uglier
[10:54:48] <robertmaxrees> you could also do all the heavy lifting yourself.
[10:55:40] <phoenixsun> what is the approach though? What do you listen to for user changes when the 'seeker bar' is just a CSS3 drawn box?
[10:56:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see how you're drawing everything.
[10:57:15] <phoenixsun> its literally just a div within a div. Using the 'width' property for the inner one
[10:57:23] <robertmaxrees> then click events.
[10:57:52] <BillCriswell> Wonder if there's any plan to move the widget factory into jQuery core? Seems really useful.
[10:58:01] <robertmaxrees> isn't in core?
[10:58:11] <robertmaxrees> oh, nope.
[10:58:19] <robertmaxrees> derp.
[10:59:04] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: how does the listener know where on the div you are clicking. I guess if my question.
[10:59:12] <phoenixsun> is*
[10:59:20] <robertmaxrees> do you have the click and drag interaction set up already?
[10:59:52] <phoenixsun> no at the moment its one way data. It goes along as the song plays
[11:00:32] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a plugin at that point and style it as you see fit then.
[11:00:40] <robertmaxrees> nouislider is a decent one
[11:00:53] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise you'll need to setup the dragging interactions on your own.
[11:01:17] <phoenixsun> ok so I should go for nouislider over riot?
[11:01:32] <robertmaxrees> they do 2 different things.
[11:01:42] <robertmaxrees> nouislider is for the slider you want.
[11:01:47] <robertmaxrees> riot does 2 way binding
[11:01:57] <phoenixsun> oh I see
[11:04:29] <PantsOfChoco> sorry robertmaxrees i walked away
[11:04:42] <robertmaxrees> i do that a lot, it's cool ;)
[11:04:44] <PantsOfChoco> what method name refresh?
[11:04:54] <robertmaxrees> yes, where did you find that?
[11:05:10] <PantsOfChoco> i thought it was a built in one on jquery ui i was reading on their site and a few stacks about it
[11:05:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that slider has a refresh method, PantsOfChoco.  at least, per the docs.
[11:05:52] <PantsOfChoco> damnit thats upsetting
[11:06:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[11:07:08] <PantsOfChoco> i have a template within a template in django and when the child template refreshes i just want to update the value of the slider
[11:08:00] <hooligan123> .draggable() seems to be a clunky?
[11:08:15] <hooligan123> a little^
[11:08:28] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco $('#miles_slider').slider({ value: 450 }); is what you want.
[11:10:36] <hooligan123> ah cool
[11:10:57] <robertmaxrees> hooligan123 who you talking to?
[11:13:49] <coderman1> i have a page that has a datatables.net table on it thats populated via ajax, how would you typically "reload" a table thats populated in that way?
[11:14:15] <robertmaxrees> !datatables reload
[11:14:18] <robertmaxrees> !g datatables reload
[11:14:20] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: ajax.reload()DT - DataTables → http://datatables.net/reference/api/ajax.reload()
[11:15:01] <coderman2> link brokey but close enough, thanks
[11:15:15] <robertmaxrees> link works for me >.>
[11:15:20] <coderman2> could also be my client
[11:15:30] <robertmaxrees> http://datatables.net/reference/api/ajax.reload%28%29 should work just fine.
[11:15:53] <hooligan123> robertmaxrees: who ever could of helped out of 791 possible people .. but i worked it out :) ... I discovered that you can make draggable() work much nicer but using transition all 0s; and found out from some guys blog that you should not use relative or padding which will cause you to be rather miffed with the performance, buth i was not, but what I was doing was doing a  transform scale() on
[11:15:53] <hooligan123> my element which slowed it slightly and also offset the position during dragging.. just mentioning for those that might care later down the road :)
[11:16:25] <robertmaxrees> hooligan123 oh, cool.
[11:17:44] <PantsOfChoco> also perfect robert thanks for the help big cat
[11:17:51] <adv_> anyone can help me rotate images in galleria.io ? seems so hard
[11:17:59] <PantsOfChoco> GALLERIA IS THE DEVIL.
[11:18:14] <robertmaxrees> use css for that.
[11:18:37] <hooligan123> it would be good if i could apply a style during .dragging() to scale it down to 0 so it will be big while being dragged and scaled when not
[11:19:26] <coderman2> what about putting a custom filter combo box next to the record limit combo box for datatables?
[11:19:57] <robertmaxrees> coderman2 that might be a better question for their forums.
[11:22:24] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: the nouislider but I dont like the handles. Cos it doesnt look modern. There is an alternative that doesnt handles?
[11:22:37] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun you can re-style it.
[11:23:59] <robertmaxrees> though i think they look plenty "modern" - how are you defining modern in this context?
[11:24:50] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: Ha ha good questions. I will say minimal style design. Flat design with no visible handle
[11:25:02] <robertmaxrees> then re-style nouislider
[11:25:04] <phoenixsun> no borders
[11:25:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah, perfectly simple theming change.
[11:25:17] <phoenixsun> ok I will see how I get on
[11:41:47] <morfin> can't i set up 2 handlers in same namespace using on?
[11:41:56] <robertmaxrees> sure can
[11:42:00] <morfin> strange
[11:42:05] <robertmaxrees> the docs show you how.
[11:43:16] <morfin> oh my ordering does not make sense
[11:43:37] <SlimPDX> Hi guys, So i'm getting this odd issue (not 100% sure if it's with JQuery) but whenever I create a carousel in jquery, the pagination doesn't work unless i resize the window first. so I'm force to trigger the resize event in my code every time i use the carousel. Any idea why this could be happening?
[11:49:43] <NodeWebbb> hi
[11:50:45] <BillCriswell> SlimPDX: Sounds broken. If you need a quick fix you should be able to fake a resize with $(window).trigger('resize');
[11:51:12] <SlimPDX> yeah that's what I'm doin right now
[11:51:39] <SlimPDX> I kinda want a more solid solution rather that invoking that
[11:52:20] <BillCriswell> SlimPDX: You should mention the name of the carousel becuase there's probably at least 2,000 of them.
[11:59:49] <morfin> hm
[12:00:01] <morfin> chrome is adding calendar to fields with type date
[12:00:55] <robertmaxrees> yep
[12:01:16] <morfin> interesting
[12:01:28] <morfin> if i add there own calendar will i rewrite that?
[12:01:47] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[12:01:54] <robertmaxrees> all browsers are adding in basic functionality like that.
[12:02:13] <robertmaxrees> there are ways to test if they support them - check out modernizr for one library
[12:02:19] <robertmaxrees> also check out feature detection.
[12:04:44] <Amnesthesia> I've found some really neat scripts although they're made with Modernizr
[12:05:20] <Amnesthesia> I'm looking to rewrite them as jQuery plugins, and I've never written a jQuery plugin before -- am I getting in too deep or is this a rather smooth process?
[12:05:35] <Amnesthesia> The scripts in question aren't more than a few hundred lines if even that
[12:06:40] <robertmaxrees> depends on what they do.
[12:07:28] <Amnesthesia> robertmaxrees: mainly CSS transitions, with some js
[12:07:39] <Amnesthesia> Mostly monitoring / reacting to scroll events, modifying classes, etc
[12:07:49] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, should be pretty easy. the plugin guide is pretty straightforward.
[12:07:53] <Amnesthesia> Sweet
[12:08:09] <Amnesthesia> I kinda just want to use them as is
[12:08:14] <robertmaxrees> then use them as is :)
[12:08:18] <Amnesthesia> nah
[12:08:33] <Amnesthesia> it just feels wrong to include a second framework just for that
[12:08:57] <Amnesthesia> :D
[12:09:07] <robertmaxrees> 1. jquery and modernizr aren't really "Frameworks".  2. you'll end up replicating behavior out of modernizr that you could just do a custom build to get instead.
[12:09:23] <Amnesthesia> robertmaxrees: oh
[12:09:49] <Amnesthesia> Well yeah, there are a few things from Modernizr that I'm not sure about in jQuery, like checking vendor-prefixes
[12:09:55] <Amnesthesia> idk, I
[12:10:01] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do that for you.
[12:10:02] <Amnesthesia> I'm so much more used to jQuery than modernizr
[12:10:04] <Amnesthesia> I know
[12:10:05] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use modernizr.
[12:10:17] <robertmaxrees> modernizr is strictly feature detection.  completely different use cases :)
[12:10:24] <Amnesthesia> Oh? :o
[12:10:35] <Amnesthesia> I thought it was an alternative to Mootools / Prototype / jQuery
[12:10:38] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:10:50] <robertmaxrees> all it does is tell you if a browser supports something.
[12:10:54] <Amnesthesia> Well then, goes to show how little I know about other js libs
[12:10:57] <Amnesthesia> Ahh
[12:11:09] <Amnesthesia> Then I guess this is just pure js with some modernizr checking
[12:22:59] <webfox> Hello folks!
[12:23:20] <SlimPDX> hi webfox  :)
[12:23:41] <webfox> Is there any recommended book for beginners someone could point me to please?
[12:23:49] <robertmaxrees> for jquery, learn.jquery.com
[12:23:57] <robertmaxrees> for javascript, JavaScript: The Definitive Guide
[12:24:27] <webfox> robertmaxrees: can I learn jquery directly or should  I learn something before?
[12:24:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest at least learning html and css first.
[12:24:59] <robertmaxrees> then javascript/jquery.
[12:25:26] <robertmaxrees> The Definitive Guide does a good job of building on itself.
[12:25:51] <webfox> Well, I already know html/css, perhaps I just need a update to html5 and css3.
[12:26:05] <robertmaxrees> or a refresher :) check out learn.jquery.com and start there.
[12:26:25] <webfox> robertmaxrees: ok, great. thanx!
[12:36:59] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: $el.data('pluginName').someMethod(...) vs $el.pluginName('someMethod', ...); Which do you prefer, why?
[12:37:20] <robertmaxrees> the second, because it feels more explicit.
[12:38:03] <robertmaxrees> .data() is to store information.  i access it to do that.  .pluginName() is for running a method against my selector.
[12:38:26] <robertmaxrees> also: convention
[12:38:51] <BillCriswell> Yeah convention is why I think the second makes more sense to me. jQuery UI and all.
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[12:39:14] <robertmaxrees> you're running methods against an object, not against something returned out of a data lookup.
[12:39:44] <BillCriswell> The data way is a lot cleaner from the plugins perspective though.
[12:39:57] <BillCriswell> At least my current understanding anyway.
[12:40:05] <adv_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25146963/galleria-io-rotate-image-and-display-fullscreen help?
[12:40:48] <BillCriswell> Where the hell is decx?
[12:41:28] <guzzlefry> Is using classes the best way to track the state of a toggle button? I could check the best content but that seems rather bad and hard to maintain.
[12:42:03] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: It's definitely quick and easy.
[12:43:08] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry classes are a good way to go.
[12:43:17] <robertmaxrees> and good question BillCriswell
[12:44:32] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: The widget factor would be perfect but having to include jQuery UI core makes me a whiny baby.
[12:50:01] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1 niiice
[12:50:59] <robertmaxrees> dude ajpiano is so awesome
[12:53:11] <_97Whiskey> If I have say $('td').on('click', function(){}), can't I pass like $(this.form) onto a different function?
[12:53:29] <BillCriswell> I still don't understand why the widget stuff is in UI and not core but I'm sure there's a good reason for that.
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you're doing it _97Whiskey
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> but you can basically do that yeah.
[12:55:09] <_97Whiskey> I thought so but it's giving me a reference to undefined property this.form
[12:55:19] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ _97Whiskey
[12:55:19] <b-ot> _97Whiskey: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:56:05] <guzzlefry> k, next question. Might not have a definitive answer but I'm wondering if there's a best practice regarding this. For my toggle button, the text content will vary depending on whether it's on or off. Should I 1) $(this).text('on or off depending'); or 2) Add spans for both, and display/hide based on the class of the <button>?
[12:58:25] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Sweet job on those widgets slides as well!
[12:58:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah gnarf++
[12:58:47] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry it's kind of dependent on what you're doing.
[12:59:03] <guzzlefry> how so?
[12:59:10] <gnarf> BillCriswell robertmaxrees: http://gnarf.net/widget-factory/#1
[12:59:15] <gnarf> most recent version of that talk that i gave
[12:59:55] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry are you already adding/removing classes?
[12:59:59] <BillCriswell> Mmm, ice cream sandwiches.
[13:00:04] <guzzlefry> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> then use CSS to target things as appropriate.
[13:00:32] <robertmaxrees> put the elements on the page.
[13:00:38] <BillCriswell> gnarf: $.widget() seems really useful. Any reason it's only available with jquery ui
[13:00:39] <BillCriswell> ?
[13:00:52] <gnarf> BillCriswell: because it's the UI widget factory?
[13:01:04] <gnarf> it stands alone
[13:01:10] <gnarf> no other dependencies
[13:01:22] <gnarf> you can just take the widget factory and nothing else
[13:01:53] <BillCriswell> gnarf:  It just seemed like something that would be nice to include with just jQuery.
[13:02:12] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Yeah I'm currently just grabbing ui core and widget factory.
[13:02:24] <gnarf> BillCriswell: the whole point is to keep things minimal and pluggable - so like - the way it is is actually the way you want it
[13:02:37] <gnarf> you might just think it would be convenient for jQuery to have all the things you find useful
[13:02:50] <gnarf> but to be honest, even the things it already does are too much for most people
[13:02:54] <_97Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/bam45/6H5C4/3/
[13:03:15] <gnarf> but animation / css / events / ajax / manipulation / traversing is like "jQuery Core"
[13:03:28] <gnarf> keeps the size of the core lib down
[13:03:28] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey okay, which line?
[13:03:37] <_97Whiskey> GenerateLink($(this.form));
[13:03:40] <_97Whiskey> 43
[13:03:58] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Agreed, but people who use jQuery use a lot of plugins so giving them an easy way without including the widget thing *seemes* like a good idea to me.
[13:04:05] <BillCriswell> I totall understand what you're saying though.
[13:04:30] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey that's not throwing errors for me at all.
[13:05:16] <robertmaxrees> though I don't understand what you think this.form is.
[13:05:38] <BillCriswell> Well, at least people in here with questions haha
[13:06:28] <_97Whiskey> Well I thought about using GenerateLink($(this).closest('form'));
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> that example doesn't have a form in it at all.
[13:06:58] <_97Whiskey> whoops
[13:07:29] <robertmaxrees> also - if statements don't have scope.
[13:07:34] <robertmaxrees> so those variables get hoisted up.
[13:07:46] <_97Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/bam45/6H5C4/4/
[13:08:21] <robertmaxrees> why are you afraid of using real words for variable names, btw?
[13:08:39] <_97Whiskey> What do you mean?
[13:08:53] <robertmaxrees> why CB instead of something like $checkBox?
[13:09:27] <_97Whiskey> I didn't think javascript did the $ variable thing and I'm self taught everything so I never did the camel case.
[13:09:48] <robertmaxrees> the $ is just to tell you it's a jquery object - no other special meaning.
[13:10:28] <robertmaxrees> so it looks like in this code you want to be able to click anywhere in a tr and have it highlight plus check the box?
[13:10:46] <_97Whiskey> yeah
[13:10:56] <_97Whiskey> and that's working, but I was wanting it to generate some text at the bottom
[13:10:56] <robertmaxrees> and then you're concatenating everything together to make a link of some kind.
[13:11:11] <AlexRussia> I have crazy question: jquery could be use together with bootstrap?
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> let's change this up a little to make things a little easier.
[13:11:27] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia not crazy - in fact, bootstrap uses jquery doesn't it?
[13:11:46] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: i didn't see them source code, idk :D
[13:12:17] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ...is aren't mean bootstrap include jquery? @_@
[13:12:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:12:43] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: i mean if i use bootstrap is like use jquery? @_@
[13:12:51] <robertmaxrees> no.  different uses
[13:12:56] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ok...
[13:13:07] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#whats-included
[13:13:16] <robertmaxrees> "Please note that all JavaScript plugins require jQuery to be included"
[13:14:18] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: i just did search 'jquery' on github :D
[13:14:24] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:14:33] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: play
[13:14:37] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: lol
[13:14:40] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: okay*
[13:14:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:14:54] <AlexRussia> pl simular as ok :D
[13:14:59] <AlexRussia> on qwertyu
[13:15:31] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: typo bro, typo
[13:15:52] <mechanicalduck> hii
[13:15:53] <robertmaxrees> i see that.  i'm very confused about what's going on.
[13:16:04] <mechanicalduck> So I get this: SyntaxError: Unexpected token ) in "[...]/layout.ejs"
[13:16:09] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: hell going on.
[13:16:09] <mechanicalduck> How can I find out what line is affected?
[13:16:12] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: sometimes
[13:16:13] <mechanicalduck> It doesn't want to tell me.
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> mechanicalduck does it give you a line number to the right?
[13:16:26] <mechanicalduck> Now I am eager to know. What is very confusing? What hell?
[13:16:30] <mechanicalduck> robertmaxrees: no
[13:16:52] <robertmaxrees> mechanicalduck is layout.ejs a file of yours?
[13:17:05] <mechanicalduck> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:17:28] <robertmaxrees> that error is usually indicative of a bad closing paren.  i'd lint the file.
[13:18:22] <mechanicalduck> https://gist.github.com/mechanicalduck/b41eb7b3b24435ab3e1e
[13:18:26] <AlexRussia> mechanicalduck: sorry for question, what mean .ejs? @_@
[13:18:32] <mechanicalduck> robertmaxrees: Do I need an EJS linter? Or just a generic JS linter?
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> what is ejs?
[13:18:46] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: i guess, E mean Embeded
[13:18:47] <mechanicalduck> robertmaxrees: some simple template language
[13:18:54] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ops, mistake :D
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> mechanicalduck then you're kind of SOL - i'd make sure it's a valid file per the ejs spec?
[13:19:25] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: ops, not http://www.file-extensions.org/ejs-file-extension
[13:19:28] <robertmaxrees> you could try a js linter and see what happens.
[13:20:12] <mechanicalduck> robertmaxrees: ok, I guess I left something blank. I hope this was the reason.
[13:20:21] <mechanicalduck> Hm, what template language would actually not leave me in the dark?
[13:20:47] <robertmaxrees> you're not really going to get much help here since this is a jquery support channel, y'know?
[13:21:28] <AlexRussia> mechanicalduck: you know, we on earth planet in solar system....
[13:21:41] <mechanicalduck> oh
[13:21:44] <mechanicalduck> ah!
[13:21:56] <AlexRussia> if i am right remember english words :D
[13:22:24] <AlexRussia> lol, ok sorry about my comism....
[13:22:26] <mechanicalduck> Right, although it is JavaScript I should rather ask in #nodejs...
[13:22:33] <_97Whiskey> Cleaned it up a bit since you didn't like my redudent lines :) http://jsfiddle.net/bam45/6H5C4/5/
[13:22:38] <AlexRussia> mechanicalduck: or #javascript i guess
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey i'm about to simplify it for you a whole bunch.
[13:22:51] <_97Whiskey> redundant*
[13:23:09] <AlexRussia> mechanicalduck: because node.js is.... interesing js LD
[13:23:11] <AlexRussia> :D*
[13:24:15] <mechanicalduck> lol
[13:25:55] <AlexRussia> mechanicalduck: is probabily could #js , but i am lazy check all this channels :D
[13:26:18] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript would tell you to go to the channel for the templating thing you're using or node.
[13:27:19] <mechanicalduck> right
[13:27:26] <necroticflesh> hmm... seems like my confirm('Are you sure?') code only gets called about half of the time.
[13:28:28] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey haven't forgotten about you.  almost done.
[13:28:47] <_97Whiskey> No rush, just playing around.
[13:29:45] <morfin> oh sh*
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/6H5C4/7/
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[13:29:53] <morfin> i got 2 datepickers on same field
[13:29:55] <morfin> lawl
[13:30:03] <b-lew> Okay I have something I can't figure out. Why isn't this opacity changing? when I check a checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/bryanlewis/9u8v8/5/
[13:30:18] <morfin> one from Chrome and one from a plugin
[13:30:29] <robertmaxrees> b-lew because you need to bind to the change event.
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> b-lew right now that code runs once on pageload.
[13:31:05] <b-lew> I need to add an on click?
[13:31:30] <robertmaxrees> yes - $(element).on('click', function() {/* put your code here */});
[13:32:05] <b-lew> thanks robertmaxrees ! I'll try that!
[13:32:19] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: then if i include on page and jqeury and bootstrap i could get hell mix? @_@
[13:32:27] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia huh?
[13:32:36] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: what?
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[13:32:45] * Amnesthesia is confused
[13:33:01] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: what you not understand?
[13:33:08] <robertmaxrees> what is "hell mix"?
[13:33:28] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey so what is the format of the string you're printing out?
[13:33:35] <BillCriswell> It sounds like a terrible mix tape.
[13:33:56] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: lol, i guess, better words is 'infernal mix'.probabily
[13:33:56] <BillCriswell> or a Journey's Greatest Hit's compilation.
[13:34:14] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia try to not use slang terms - what are you asking?
[13:34:19] <_97Whiskey> I was just going to have it print like 1,2,3 if 1, 2 and 3 were selected.
[13:34:19] <robertmaxrees> if it's a good combination?
[13:34:21] <Amnesthesia> BillCriswell: in the case of mix tapes, it sounds like *the* mix tape
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey ah, easy.
[13:34:26] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:34:32] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia i don't personally like bootstrap.
[13:34:41] <_97Whiskey> I like how you declared the variables all at once there.
[13:34:44] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: why no?
[13:35:12] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia it's a little heavier than i'd like and is very specific about how it wants you to do things, which makes it a little unflexible.
[13:35:23] <Amnesthesia> robertmaxrees: just bootstrap or all css frameworks?
[13:35:30] <Amnesthesia> ah
[13:35:32] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap is more than a CSS framework.
[13:35:44] <Amnesthesia> front-end framework*
[13:35:53] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: is union js and css for get beautiful thing's :D
[13:36:02] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: and html(5)
[13:36:16] <Amnesthesia> I know :>
[13:36:19] <Amnesthesia> but I prefer Bourbon
[13:36:20] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: :>
[13:36:31] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: you are alcoholic? @_@
[13:36:38] <Amnesthesia> no, www.bourbon.io
[13:37:02] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: this site are market of bourbon's? @_@
[13:37:07] <Amnesthesia> haha no
[13:37:16] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: ok.
[13:37:45] <Amnesthesia> Bourbon ≈ Bootstrap
[13:37:52] <Amnesthesia> it's similar but not the same
[13:38:01] <AlexRussia> lol, unicode in irc :D
[13:38:03] <Amnesthesia> same usage different way of doing it
[13:38:40] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: RUBY @_@
[13:38:51] <Amnesthesia> sweet, sweet ruby
[13:38:58] <DelphiWorld> hi jqueryist
[13:39:00] <Amnesthesia> you can use it with PHP too though
[13:39:08] <DelphiWorld> i have a problem with background
[13:39:17] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: no, thx, i am not php fanatic :D
[13:39:20] <DelphiWorld> it's not taking effect on all page
[13:39:30] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: Rails is power!
[13:39:31] <Amnesthesia> :D
[13:39:37] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: as sinatra too :D
[13:39:59] <robertmaxrees> _97Whiskey http://jsfiddle.net/6H5C4/8/ this will give you the basic idea.
[13:40:10] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: you know sinatra, isn't?
[13:40:11] <robertmaxrees> and now I go to lunch.  enjoy folks.
[13:40:16] <Amnesthesia> yep

[13:40:39] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: not, i am not about singer....
[13:40:53] <Amnesthesia> DelphiWorld: what's up?
[13:41:19] <Amnesthesia> DelphiWorld: and stop using root ;)
[13:41:23] <DelphiWorld> Amnesthesia: the bg of my site is visible only up on scroling down... want it to cover all my page, someone told me jquery css is overwriting
[13:41:34] <DelphiWorld> Amnesthesia: LoL
[13:42:05] <DelphiWorld> Amnesthesia: want me to pmyou the SITE?
[13:42:10] <Amnesthesia> yes please
[13:42:14] <AlexRussia> DelphiWorld: still use  root? Barmin coming to you!
[13:42:16] * DelphiWorld cleared log...
[13:42:24] <Amnesthesia> AlexRussia: haha who is Barmin?
[13:42:34] <HowardwLo> Hi diddly doo neighbor, is this the proper place for history API ?
[13:42:50] <DelphiWorld> lol AlexRussia
[13:43:21] <_97Whiskey> Thank you Robertmaxress, I didn't know you could group them like that.
[13:43:36] <_97Whiskey> Robertmaxrees*
[13:43:40] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: by some reason, `rm -rf /` in russian wikipedia have alias 'Barmin patch'
[13:43:48] <Amnesthesia> lmfao
[13:43:58] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: i understand only f....
[13:44:07] <Amnesthesia> hahaha
[13:44:10] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: lol
[13:44:13] <DelphiWorld> Amnesthesia: mind pm?
[13:44:25] * DelphiWorld slap AlexRussia with MP40
[13:44:37] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: why is it when I take out the .length this works but when the length is in there it doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/bryanlewis/9u8v8/11/
[13:44:37] <Amnesthesia> DelphiWorld: Go for it!
[13:44:56] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: trying to make it more than one checkbox selected
[13:44:58] <AlexRussia> DelphiWorld: f*cking nazi
[13:45:16] * DelphiWorld order SAMS from AlexRussia ...
[13:45:25] <AlexRussia> SAMS? @_@
[13:45:26] <thebope> I have an onchange="myMethod(this)". When I do a .clone() call and append to a table, does the method automatically point to the 'old' this?
[13:45:33] * DelphiWorld pay 1000000USD for AlexRussia to deliver scuds 3
[13:45:45] <DelphiWorld> lol
[13:45:57] <Amnesthesia> b-lew: I'm not sure so this is kind of a guess, but perhaps because is(':checked') returns a value that isn't 0/1
[13:46:06] * AlexRussia pick up table 'not payable'
[13:46:27] <AlexRussia> DelphiWorld: so, what is SAMS?
[13:46:31] <b-lew> interesting Amnesthesia
[13:46:39] <b-lew> I'll try another method.
[13:46:43] <DelphiWorld> AlexRussia: russians... dont yet know SAMS?
[13:46:45] <thebope> Surfaqce to Air missle systems?
[13:46:48] <sacho> b-lew, why do you have multiple elements with the same id?
[13:46:50] <sacho> that's invalid html.
[13:47:10] <AlexRussia> DelphiWorld: so maybe you tell me what is it?
[13:47:17] <b-lew> oh believe me... I know!!! not my issue right now though.
[13:47:19] <sacho> b-lew, .is() would work fine for your case. it returns true/false.
[13:47:23] <thebope> AlexRussia, I told you lol
[13:47:25] <sacho> so what's your issue?
[13:47:27] <AlexRussia> DelphiWorld: 'say, are me shit'?
[13:47:50] <DelphiWorld> AlexRussia: ended that topic (orfftopic) here and goes to you over pm :P
[13:48:17] <b-lew> sacho trying to change the opacity when more than 1 checkbox is true.
[13:48:25] <sacho> b-lew, the second and third checkboxes don't have click handlers bound.
[13:48:37] <sacho> because selection via an id implies selecting one element.
[13:49:19] <sacho> (nor would they match for your .is() check)
[13:50:03] <b-lew> if I change it to class it will check if multiple checkboxs are selected?
[13:50:10] <sacho> b-lew, here you go http://jsfiddle.net/9u8v8/15/
[13:52:11] <b-lew> sacho they both work the same. try to say if more than 1 checkbox is checked (2 or greater) than the opacity changes
[13:52:46] * sacho is not really sure what you're talking about now.
[13:53:46] <b-lew> well in your example the opacity changes if 1 is changed.
[13:55:26] <b-lew> I hope that makes more sense.
[13:56:04] <sacho> then don't use .is()
[13:57:00] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/9u8v8/17/
[13:57:30] <b-lew> thanks sacho! thanks exactly what I need!
[13:59:16] <necroticflesh> what's the proper way to make anchor tags have confirmation behavior?
[14:01:28] <necroticflesh> I cannot for the life of me get this anchor tag to display a confirmation dialog when clicked.
[14:02:25] <necroticflesh> http://dpaste.com/2KXWNPZ
[14:04:05] <necroticflesh> this code works, dpaste.com/24C9MGP but it doesn't seem to always work the first time.
[14:04:37] <droid909> why array is empty? http://jsfiddle.net/972W4/
[14:05:11] <BillCriswell> necroticflesh: ou must have a different error. Works fine here: http://jsbin.com/veqizofa/1/edit
[14:06:31] <robertmaxrees> droid909 wrong iterator syntax
[14:06:34] <sacho> droid909, you have the order of for's parameters mixed up - they are initial state; condition; action
[14:06:41] <sacho> e.g. i = 0; i < 20; i++
[14:07:28] <necroticflesh> strange
[14:08:05] <BillCriswell> necroticflesh: Take a look at your console and make sure there's nothing red.
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh also, use event.preventDefault() instead of return false;;

[14:11:50] <robertmaxrees> can you show us how it's broken?

[14:13:21] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld can you reduce the problem down at all?
[14:13:24] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: due to my blindness and that site stupidity in accessibility
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld huh?
[14:13:38] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: i am blind yes
[14:13:39] <sacho> what about jsbin?
[14:13:39] <robertmaxrees> scri66le sure - get an awesome job writing javascript like I do.
[14:13:46] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld aaaah.  okay.
[14:13:53] <scri66le> wanna hire me? robertmaxrees
[14:13:54] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: not joking
[14:14:04] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld wasn't saying you are...
[14:14:11] <robertmaxrees> scri66le not my choice ;)
[14:14:19] <DelphiWorld> sacho: same, they are pretty much real time that cause screen reader to  crash
[14:14:42] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld it's hard for us to help if we can't see the problem in action.  if all you can give us is a link to the site, that's fine.
[14:15:06] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: index: http://paste.debian.net/113862/
[14:15:25] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: and css: http://paste.debian.net/113863/
[14:15:28] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:15:37] <robertmaxrees> can you just link to your livesite please?
[14:15:50] <DelphiWorld> ok, fuck the screamers.
[14:15:55] <DelphiWorld> http://bachaer.me/
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> okay - how do i replicate the problem?
[14:16:30] <DelphiWorld> browse on FF and chrome you'lle see diferent background issue
[14:16:45] <robertmaxrees> you have a console error you should fix first btw.
[14:16:49] <DelphiWorld> the background dont aply the same way, and in chrome it take only when you scrole down
[14:16:55] <DelphiWorld> tel me?
[14:17:01] <robertmaxrees> $(...).ticker is not a function
[14:17:02] * DelphiWorld cant read the js consol
[14:17:13] <DelphiWorld> ok just forget that, let me kick it out
[14:17:19] <AlexRussia> Amnesthesia: http://neat.bourbon.io/ seems funny
[14:17:38] <robertmaxrees> the issue with the background has nothing to do with the background.
[14:17:59] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: console issue fixed...
[14:18:17] <robertmaxrees> you're setting min-height on a container to be whatever the height of the window is on resize, DelphiWorld
[14:18:34] <DelphiWorld> ok robertmaxrees what you want it to be
[14:18:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:18:50] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: what should i set it to?
[14:19:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't know - why are you setting it to the height of the viewport?
[14:19:47] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: everything related to display it confuse me, cause i use only tts to browse
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld do you have somebody else that can help you with this particular bug then?  or is this a personal project?
[14:20:50] <DelphiWorld> robertmaxrees: personal, and everyone with me dont know anything about css. they just tel me how its look
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> DelphiWorld hrm.
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> i don't have time to really dig in right now tbh.  if i can later i'll help.
[14:21:36] <DelphiWorld> okay maybe someone else...
[14:21:39] * DelphiWorld is here;)
[14:30:34] <dleynes661> I'm trying to use $("#id").css("display", "none"); to hide an element but it seems a script is overriding it due to the loading order
[14:30:47] <dleynes661> any way I can prioritize it despite the load order?
[14:32:12] <robertmaxrees> you're as specific as you can get.
[14:32:20] <robertmaxrees> you have to come in after the other script.
[14:33:40] * DelphiWorld will have to *sleep*...
[14:33:45] <DelphiWorld> night guys
[14:33:51] <DelphiWorld> happy jQuerying
[14:34:10] <dleynes661> *shucks*
[14:35:19] <TheSin> I have an object and one of the items in it is a function, obj.callback = function() {}; when I tried to send that obj via ajax, $.ajax({data{ obj: obj}}); it runs the function, is there a way to encode that function intoa a string or something?
[14:35:48] <robertmaxrees> TheSin you can't send functions as apart of data.
[14:36:09] <TheSin> I can't even turn it into a string?
[14:36:31] <robertmaxrees> you can try to toSource it, but that's a bad idea.
[14:36:57] <TheSin> is there an example of best practice to db save callbacks then?
[14:37:11] <robertmaxrees> "to db save callbacks" meaning?
[14:37:23] <robertmaxrees> what backend are you using?
[14:37:41] <TheSin> I have a plugin, that sends notifications, each notification can ahve a callback, but I need to save the notifications between sessions
[14:37:59] <TheSin> to save the notifications I need to save the callback so I can recreate them at the next session
[14:38:09] <robertmaxrees> that's a really dangerous idea.
[14:38:30] <robertmaxrees> store that state in your backend instead of transmitting javascript to your DB.
[14:38:48] <TheSin> sadly I can't each callback is unique
[14:39:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:39:15] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code
[14:39:48] <TheSin> not easily, let me see what I can come up with since it's a very very large private site
[14:39:49] <dleynes661> Hmm..anyways I can get the hide script to constantly check for the div
[14:39:56] <dleynes661> and if it is displayed, hide it
[14:40:03] <dleynes661> anyway*
[14:40:35] <robertmaxrees> dleynes661 that's a hack.  what other plugin is causing headaches?
[14:40:41] <robertmaxrees> does it have a callback you can hook into?
[14:41:11] <dleynes661> It's actually an ecommerce platform: tictail
[14:41:29] <dleynes661> I would like to hide a an annoying icon. It's a follow button
[14:41:37] <dleynes661> they don't let you hide it
[14:41:43] <dleynes661> not even with a paid option..
[14:42:03] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: jquery have '.each'?
[14:42:07] <robertmaxrees> who is the follow button for, dleynes661?
[14:42:25] <dleynes661> For my site, but I don't like it.
[14:42:32] <dleynes661> I want it gone.
[14:42:53] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery each
[14:42:54] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery.each() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[14:42:58] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia ^
[14:43:06] <robertmaxrees> there are two different ones you can use.
[14:43:27] <robertmaxrees> AlexRussia http://api.jquery.com/each/ this is the other one
[14:43:38] <dleynes661> function checkVisibility(){
[14:43:38] <robertmaxrees> dleynes661 without seeing it, it's hard to know what you're talking about.
[14:43:38] <dleynes661>    //put the visibility checker here
[14:43:39] <dleynes661>    setTimeout('checkVisibility',1000)//every 1 second...
[14:43:40] <dleynes661> }
[14:43:52] <robertmaxrees> dleynes661 please do not paste multiple lines in the channel.
[14:43:52] <AlexRussia> robertmaxrees: no, i've just check my think,thx
[14:44:05] <robertmaxrees> dleynes661 using timers is generally a bad idea.
[14:44:13] <dleynes661> http://rachelstewartjewelry.com/
[14:44:21] <dleynes661> top right
[14:44:27] <dleynes661> I want it gone.
[14:44:33] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[14:44:36] <robertmaxrees> leave it there.
[14:44:50] <robertmaxrees> check their TOS or contact their support department.
[14:45:04] <dleynes661> *going rebel*
[14:45:06] <dleynes661> haha
[14:45:18] <robertmaxrees> something tells me they're not going to be OK with you doing that.
[14:45:31] <dleynes661> I know I know. haha
[14:49:47] <phoenixsun> its seems there is no easy way to make the handles in nouislider vanish
[14:50:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:50:55] <robertmaxrees> display: none; on them.
[14:53:39] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: ok that did it
[14:54:37] <necroticflesh> This is so strange...
[14:54:51] <necroticflesh> Sometimes the confirm() dialog appears, other times it doesn't.
[14:55:11] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh are you binding a listener to something that doesn't exist on pageload?
[14:55:11] <sacho> do you have a test case?
[14:55:13] <necroticflesh> When it does, clicking cancel will just perform the action anyway.
[14:55:22] <damarusama> I want to fadeIn() and #menuTeacher - does it matter with #menuTeacher has inline style of display:none?
[14:55:41] <sacho> necroticflesh, are you preventing the default action in your handler?
[14:55:49] <necroticflesh> robertmaxrees I'm attaching the listener within $(document).ready(function(){ //etc }});
[14:55:55] <necroticflesh> so... I would think that it does exist.
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh that's not what i asked ;)
[14:55:59] <necroticflesh> when the code is ran.
[14:56:07] <necroticflesh> then I don't understand your question. :P
[14:56:14] <damarusama> and is   $("#menuTeacher", this).fadeIn();  the right way to write that?
[14:56:15] <sacho> you can add elements after page load.
[14:56:17] <robertmaxrees> are you adding the link via javascript?
[14:56:31] <necroticflesh> ah, no, only the confirmation dialog code.
[14:56:38] <necroticflesh> via the confirm(); function.
[14:56:51] <necroticflesh> that is the only javascripty part of this anchor tag I'm dealing with.
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh then your binding isn't working the way you think it is.
[14:57:03] <necroticflesh> also, the anchor tag is to delete a record from my Rails app.
[14:57:16] <robertmaxrees> there's a few different ways to gaurantee what you're trying to do.  mind creating a fiddle real quick?
[14:57:38] <necroticflesh> someone actually created a fiddle from the code I pasted, and it worked flawlessly for them, so I guess there's some other weirdness going on within my app.
[14:57:56] <damarusama> dropped the .this and all good
[14:57:58] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh could you try anyway?
[14:58:04] <necroticflesh> sure.
[14:59:21] <necroticflesh> Oh, actually, someone also suggested checking the console output, and I'm seeing: TypeError: $(...).foundation is not a function
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[14:59:33] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause problems.
[15:00:57] <necroticflesh> hmm, this is weird...
[15:01:05] <necroticflesh> I wonder if it has to do with the Foundation template I'm using.
[15:01:16] <necroticflesh> The Foundation template I'm using placed the javascript includes within the <body> element.
[15:01:26] <necroticflesh> It seems that typically it goes in the <head> element.
[15:01:30] <robertmaxrees> that error means that foundation isn't loaded by the time your code runs.
[15:02:24] <jphase> yeah, foundation does all it's work shy of </body> like it should
[15:02:25] <necroticflesh> ha... I put the script inclusion in the <head> element.
[15:02:34] <necroticflesh> no more errors about foundation.
[15:02:38] <jphase> $(document).foundation();  is what I assume you mean yeah
[15:02:55] <necroticflesh> although now you're telling me this is how foundation should work.
[15:03:01] <necroticflesh> which is slightly concerning.
[15:03:06] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:03:15] <robertmaxrees> what's concerning?
[15:03:43] <necroticflesh> jphase says foundation does all of it's work "shy of </body> like it should"
[15:03:44] <jphase> uh, it's best practice to put most js just shy of </body>
[15:03:50] <jphase> not just foundation
[15:03:54] <jphase> but most js should be there
[15:04:05] <necroticflesh> why's that?
[15:04:12] <robertmaxrees> defer load until later.
[15:04:21] <robertmaxrees> let the page render and give the user something to look at.
[15:04:27] <jphase> well you can wrap every ol' thing in a doc ready wrapper but it runs after every element is on the page if you don't
[15:05:05] <necroticflesh> hmm...
[15:05:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:05:36] <robertmaxrees> doc ready fires once.
[15:05:51] <necroticflesh> the errors about foundation have mysteriously disappeared.
[15:07:11] <necroticflesh> http://jsbin.com/zojoxexi/1/edit
[15:07:51] <necroticflesh> could rel="nofollow" have something to do with it?
[15:08:23] <necroticflesh> <a class="button confirm" data-method="delete" href="http://website/boards/35" rel="nofollow">Delete Board</a>
[15:08:30] <necroticflesh> that's the anchor tag
[15:08:33] <necroticflesh> in my actual code
[15:08:39] <robertmaxrees> one sec, let me show you the smarter way to do this.
[15:09:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/6E76B/
[15:10:59] <necroticflesh> still not working
[15:11:14] <robertmaxrees> then the anchor is getting added after the binding is runnin.
[15:11:18] <sacho> define "not working"
[15:11:21] <robertmaxrees> or something else is binding after that's preventing the default.
[15:11:31] <sacho> necroticflesh, use your browser's developer tools - place a breakpoint in the code and step through it.
[15:12:01] <necroticflesh> I'm actually trying to figure out if the event is actually attached to this anchor's click event.
[15:12:36] <necroticflesh> any idea how to do that with firefox?
[15:13:14] <robertmaxrees> breakpoint, yo.
[15:13:30] <jphase> necroticflesh, if the anchor was dynamically created you'll want to delegate your event and bind to the document
[15:13:42] <robertmaxrees> or to a parent that exists on pageload.
[15:13:47] <jphase> ^
[15:13:55] <robertmaxrees> avoid the document.
[15:14:01] <necroticflesh> the anchor is only dynamically created on the backend.
[15:14:15] <robertmaxrees> then something else is going on.
[15:14:16] <jphase> then it should be fine to bind to it
[15:14:25] <jphase> you can confirm by unbinding the click on it before you bind another
[15:14:28] <necroticflesh> it works half the time.
[15:14:45] <robertmaxrees> what happens the other half of the time?
[15:14:46] <necroticflesh> maybe foundation is doing something with it?
[15:14:54] <necroticflesh> because... there is a foundation class 'button' that is added to it.
[15:15:03] <jphase> that's only for styles
[15:15:08] <necroticflesh> yeah, I thought so...
[15:15:42] <necroticflesh> half of the time, the button just deletes the record with no confirmation, other times the confirmation appears, but even when it does, both options 'ok' and 'cancel' have the same effect, deleting the record anyway.
[15:16:47] <frickettz> http://pastebin.com/NnHtRCzw  I'm trying to trigger .change() on my select element depending on a url parameter, but it won't trigger.  The statement just doesn't seem to run, however if I open up the console in chrome and run the statement, it works. Any ideas?
[15:17:14] <robertmaxrees> does #login-type exist on pageload?
[15:19:03] <frickettz> yeah
[15:19:19] <frickettz> I'm not adding anything to the dom, it's all there in the html
[15:19:49] <robertmaxrees> then document ready is firing before the element exists (likely an invalid document) or something else is going on. also - put your event handler before your if statement
[15:20:16] <xxtjaxx> exit
[15:20:27] <frickettz> Thanks, I'll try moving that to see if it works
[15:21:42] <necroticflesh> also... I can see in my html output, that all of the foundation stuff is included before my application's javascript...
[15:21:51] <robertmaxrees> okay
[15:21:53] <frickettz> Thanks robertmaxrees, putting the event handler before my if statement worked.  I thought in javascript there was no real order like that?
[15:21:59] <necroticflesh> so, this .foundation is not a function error seems kinda strange.
[15:22:22] <robertmaxrees> frickettz there is.
[15:22:28] <robertmaxrees> it matters.
[15:22:57] <necroticflesh> http://dpaste.com/1T4FJAQ
[15:23:01] <frickettz> Hm, ok thank you sir!  Such a simple thing.. been at it over an hour.
[15:23:20] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh it's going to be hard to help you at this point without seeing the site in action.
[15:24:03] <necroticflesh> alright, well, you have to be logged in to see it
[15:24:15] <necroticflesh> so, if you'd like to me to PM you the credentials, I can do that.
[15:24:15] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:24:18] <robertmaxrees> no thank you
[15:24:30] <necroticflesh> it's all in development
[15:24:33] <robertmaxrees> if you can share them with me, you can share them with the room ;) and i'm uncomfortable with that anyway
[15:24:35] <necroticflesh> so, these credentials are garbage anyway
[15:24:46] <necroticflesh> not used in any production site
[15:24:49] <necroticflesh> just a dummy login
[15:24:58] <robertmaxrees> still makes me feel uncomfortable.  sorry
[15:25:00] <necroticflesh> I just don't want a bunch of people logging in at the same time
[15:25:02] <necroticflesh> and screwing with it
[15:25:17] <necroticflesh> okay, well, here's the site: http://nullglitch.com:3000/
[15:25:26] <necroticflesh> login with batman@icloud.com:batsbatsbats
[15:26:14] <necroticflesh> then go to new board -> make a board -> then click on the board in the list -> and then it's the "delete board" button
[15:28:09] <necroticflesh> I'm the one who owns the app, it's not being made for anyone but me
[15:28:29] <necroticflesh> there's no client or company that owns this app, it's all me
[15:29:22] <decx> i'm so going to mess with the site and tell all my friends to login !
[15:29:53] <necroticflesh> well, feel free, all the data is added with a script, so I can just reset it whenever.
[15:30:21] <decx> dodgson, dodgson we got dodgson here
[15:30:28] <necroticflesh> it's all dummy data, so, have at it.
[15:32:54] <necroticflesh> hmm, I think I have an idea how to fix it...
[15:35:16] <necroticflesh> hmm, got the errors to go away, but the confirmation dialog still works as it always has.
[15:35:49] <necroticflesh> only appearing half of the time, and deleting even when 'cancel' is selected.
[15:38:25] <necroticflesh> doesn't appear to get called at all.
[15:38:40] <necroticflesh> put a console.log('called') statement in the callback, not seeing output in the console.
[15:40:47] <necroticflesh> I don't even see the script in the breakpoint/debugger thingy.
[15:40:51] <necroticflesh> I see all of the other scripts...
[15:52:54] <PantsOfChoco> DODSON!
[15:53:05] <PantsOfChoco> see nobody careeees
[15:54:15] <PantsOfChoco> jquery peeps i need help. has anyone had problems using .replacewith with on an ajax call. If i replace what i had before with text, it worked fine and if i try to replace it with html content it doesnt work but the html in the request shows up fine
[15:58:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:59:52] <necroticflesh> I'm actually thinking of just using a static HTML confirmation page.
[16:00:11] <necroticflesh> The confirm() dialog doesn't load on my mobile browser either.
[16:00:26] <PantsOfChoco> http://jsfiddle.net/886J9/4/ thats my data if it repalces with anything ebsides that it works just not my html data
[16:01:08] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh you said that the code isn't even showing in your debugger
[16:01:29] <robertmaxrees> PantsOfChoco sounds like your stuff isn't properly decoded.
[16:01:36] <necroticflesh> yeah, but I can see the console output from the code.
[16:01:39] <necroticflesh> which is really strange.
[16:01:51] <robertmaxrees> necroticflesh then you have something really strange happening.
[16:04:57] <necroticflesh> I'm going to use an HTML confirmation page, I can't figure out what's going on with my JS.
[16:05:05] <necroticflesh> thanks for your help though.
[16:12:37] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha i have the best example of "but it works!" now.
[16:13:02] <decx> democrazy?
[16:13:13] <decx> c
[16:13:29] <robertmaxrees> image extensions vs file contents vs content-type headers.
[16:14:32] <robertmaxrees> take a jpeg and give it the file extension of gif.  hit it with your browser - if the content-type header is image/jpeg, the browser will work with it just fine.
[16:14:59] <robertmaxrees> if your server returns the content-type header as image/gif, it'll still work in every browser but IE.
[16:16:03] <robertmaxrees> we changed out our image caching system, which caused things to break in IE.  people said "this used to work just fine, why'd you break it?"
[16:18:19] <decx> well why did you
[16:18:27] <decx> cmon it liked worked just fine
[16:18:59] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:37:26] <PantsOfChoco> how do i parameterize a word with an apostrophe
[16:37:29] <PantsOfChoco> its being a jerk
[16:37:33] <PantsOfChoco> how do you all enjoy this crap
[16:38:07] <PantsOfChoco> like my parameter is area=O'neils but in the url it is area = O%27neils so it can never match it
[16:45:57] <robertmaxrees> do conversions
[16:46:07] <PantsOfChoco> with the querystring?
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent
[16:52:19] <robertmaxrees> those are purpose made for things like this :)
[16:53:30] <sammych> so, we're supposed to be doing === for proper comparisons
[16:53:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:53:51] <sammych> what about checks for falseyness
[16:53:57] <robertmaxrees> depends on the check.
[16:54:14] <sammych> if I know it's gonna be a boolean, do I use if (blah === true) or if (blah)?
[16:54:25] <robertmaxrees> if (blah) is fine
[16:54:32] <sammych> good
[16:54:38] <sammych> just popped into my head
[16:55:00] <robertmaxrees> putting the word is in front of the name is your best bet - if (isBlah) {}
[16:55:10] <sammych> is type+value checking faster?
[16:55:22] <sammych> or just safer?
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> both
[16:55:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the engine has to do a ton of work to compare.
[16:56:12] <sammych> yeah, as I suspected
[16:56:53] <sammych> more like a real language ;)
[16:57:04] <sammych> *jabs*
[17:03:52] <robertmaxrees> lol you should check out JavaScript: The Good Parts.
[17:30:39] <BillCriswell> Damn nicks.
[18:08:48] <davesleep> anyone here used tinyMCE?
[18:22:32] <thedownloader> hallo :D
[18:23:30] <thedownloader> can someone help me add text to this textbox with query ?
[18:23:30] <thedownloader> http://pastebin.com/1FTMUa97
[18:27:08] <HowardwLo> if you’re using pushstate and popstate with ajax, what type of content do you need to pass into state?
[18:27:17] <HowardwLo> i assume its the div’s you swap out using ajax?
[19:17:14] <jak2000> ih all
[19:23:51] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/A72Tr/  anyone can click on Agregar button, not add the row, this jsfiddle would be similar to  http://datatables.net/examples/api/add_row.html  any advice how to fix? thanks
[19:29:20] <futzhu> jqwidget www.jqwidgets.com vs jquery which one is good for web development?
[19:33:15] <systemfault> futzhu: jquerywidgets is some widget library created by some dude..
[19:33:29] <systemfault> futzhu: It uses jQuery… so your question doesn’t make sense.
[19:34:26] <futzhu> systemfault: ooh sorry i just new with jquery. so it just a widget from javascript library jquery. thanks for explanation
[19:35:39] <jak2000> futzhu any advice for me?
[19:36:58] <morfin> Netbeans knows jQuery?
[19:37:09] <futzhu> jak2000: teach me how to use jquery with php submit form or stfu
[19:37:09] <morfin> *NetBeans
[19:38:25] <morfin> wait what?
[19:38:45] <morfin> jqWidgets looks like thing i was looking for hmm
[19:41:16] <systemfault> Peace and <3
[19:42:34] <morfin> interesting is there a ways to implement own widgets
[20:42:46] <sammych> jQM Tabs are giving me the shits
[21:14:14] <sammych> damn, looks like a jQM bug
[21:14:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[21:14:36] <sammych> http://jsfiddle.net/2769c/
[21:14:43] <sammych> tabs don't init properly
[21:15:53] <robertmaxrees> why would what you shared work?
[21:16:31] <sammych> why not?
[21:18:18] <sammych> first one is the 'main' page. Clicking the link loads a page with another 'page' with tabs and tabbed content. It appears that the tabs aren't recognising there are tabs with the appropriate hashes/ids in the nav-element
[21:18:46] <robertmaxrees> it looks liike you're mixing single with multi-page templates.
[21:19:51] <stud3nt> what is this code doing ? ->   var id=$(this).val();
[21:19:51] <stud3nt> var dataString = 'id='+ id;
[21:20:21] <robertmaxrees> stud3nt that's getting the value of a form element and then appending that to a string.
[21:21:10] <stud3nt> thank you robertmaxrees
[21:21:24] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery .val()
[21:21:25] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .val() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/val/
[21:21:53] <robertmaxrees> the api documentation is pretty amazing.
[21:22:16] <stud3nt> okay i'm reading now :D
[21:22:42] <robertmaxrees> sammych for what it's worth - http://jsfiddle.net/2769c/1/
[21:24:10] <sammych> robertmaxrees: you added jQM to the dependencies?
[21:24:16] <stud3nt> var dataString = 'id='+ id; the first id is character, right?
[21:24:27] <robertmaxrees> stud3nt huh?
[21:24:30] <coby> robertmaxrees: nice :D
[21:24:42] <sammych> strings go between single or double quotes
[21:24:46] <robertmaxrees> sammych no.  i copy/pasted the html in your source page into the fiddle.
[21:24:56] <robertmaxrees> stud3nt 'id=' is a string, yes.
[21:25:07] <stud3nt> thank you
[21:25:10] <robertmaxrees> 'id=' + id is a string concatenation.
[21:25:40] <sammych> robertmaxrees: I see that...
[21:25:45] <sammych> but trying to see the point
[21:25:52] <sammych> apart from me not linking to it here
[21:25:59] <robertmaxrees> sammych it doesn't propery work there, ether.
[21:26:00] <robertmaxrees> *either
[21:26:05] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to do?
[21:26:19] <sammych> yes it does
[21:26:31] <stud3nt> i'm trying to implement a dynamic select box
[21:26:57] <stud3nt> using the jquery ajax
[21:27:20] <robertmaxrees> sammych the first tab isn't selected in the one i pasted, but the contents for it are showing.
[21:28:09] <sammych> in my example, both tab contents are visible ('first tab contents', and 'asdasdasd')
[21:28:20] <sammych> and changing the tabs doesn't work
[21:28:28] <sammych> in your change, the tabs...work
[21:28:37] <stud3nt> what is this code trying to do? $(".city").html(html);
[21:28:48] <robertmaxrees> stud3nt you should check out learn.jquery.com
[21:28:53] <robertmaxrees> or check out api.jquery.com
[21:28:54] <sammych> stud3nt: or use google
[21:29:16] <robertmaxrees> sammych so you want to be able to launch a single-page site from a link?
[21:29:33] <sammych> stud3nt: and some knowledge of CSS selectors wouldn't go astray
[21:30:02] <stud3nt> thanks robertmaxrees & sammych
[21:30:22] <sammych> robertmaxrees: the pages are dynamically loaded in, that's all
[21:30:56] <sammych> I'm building an app with over a dozen separate pages in it, and I'm not putting all the markup in one doc
[21:31:02] <robertmaxrees> sammych iirc there are 2 basic ways to use jquery mobile - single page or multipage.
[21:31:36] <sammych> href="page2.html" will $.load() in a page for you
[21:32:23] <sammych> while href="#localPage1" will load up a div[role=page]#localPage1 on the document
[21:33:15] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i'm not communicatiing clearly.
[21:38:20] <sammych> well, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong, and you haven't quite told me why
[21:38:40] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to mix a single page app with a multi page app.
[21:38:43] <robertmaxrees> that's why
[21:40:48] <robertmaxrees> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/pages/ this explains it better than I can.
[21:42:27] <robertmaxrees> if you DO think you've found a legitimate bug, feel free to go to the #jquery-dev channel and talk to them about it :)
[21:42:29] <robertmaxrees> or submit a bug.
[21:43:04] <sammych> well, I'm not sure there's even a distinction between a single-/multi-page
[21:43:20] <robertmaxrees> the docs say there is.
[21:43:54] <robertmaxrees> also: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-links.html
[21:44:28] <sammych> well, I'm several pages into my app, and navigation works just fine
[21:44:42] <sammych> everything except for the tabs aren't being init'd properly
[21:45:09] <robertmaxrees> "You cannot link to a multipage document with Ajax navigation active because the framework will only load the first page it finds, not the full set of internal pages." seems relevant
[21:45:12] <sammych> I've got a persistent toolbar with buttons[rel="back"] and they work fine
[21:45:52] <sammych> I'm not linking to a multi-page document
[21:48:16] <sammych> robertmaxrees: I think it's this bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7169
[21:51:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing the duplicated content, but ok.
[21:51:35] <sammych> it's inside the dodgy tab
[21:52:02] <sammych> $('#ui-tabs-1')
[21:52:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not seeing it here.
[21:52:27] <robertmaxrees> oh strange now i am.
[21:52:46] <sammych> I'm going to try and init manually anyway
[21:53:30] <robertmaxrees> very strange.  sorry for the confusion on my behalf.
[21:54:00] <sammych> no worries
[21:54:40] <robertmaxrees> we get a lot of "halp $('input').val() = 'ninjitsuuuu' doesn't work pretty sure it's a bug in jQuery" type reports in here.
[21:55:17] <sammych> your caution is not unexpected
[21:56:04] <sammych> I've been doing JS for nearly 2 years, so not a noob, but not yet a master ;)
[21:56:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:56:27] <robertmaxrees> you should comment that issue with your example btw.
[21:56:29] <robertmaxrees> might be helpful.
[21:56:40] <sammych> yeah, I just had to figure out what my password was lol
[21:57:33] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: isn't that the problem of all apis ever ;)
[21:57:43] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis hahaha
[22:01:34] <sammych> bwahaha
[22:01:50] <sammych> sucks that I have to manually init it, but hey, workaround
[22:13:11] <jphase> mah ninjas! >:D
[22:14:44] <robertmaxrees> unf
[22:16:04] <sammych> anyone, FYI: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7169, added reply to bottom
[22:17:06] <robertmaxrees> might want to ping over in #jquery-dev, too.
[22:18:51] <jphase> hrm, I either don't know what "loading twice" means or I'm unable to reproduce
[22:20:11] <jphase> <fail>oh, also not sure where I got "loading twice" as a quote lol</fail>
[22:21:17] <sammych> it's on the OP first line?
[22:21:35] <jphase> oh, I was just being literal s/loading/load
[22:21:37] <jphase> oh, I was just being literal s/loading/loads
[22:22:00] <sammych> eh, it's the internet, I'll forgive you if you paraphrase between double quotes
[22:22:34] <jphase> I suppose double quotes do leave room for "interpretation" ooooooo
[22:22:43] <jphase> I'm either drunk, or that was funny, or both
[22:22:47] <jorvis_> Selection question:  If I have a reference to a <li> element, how do I select the next sibling <li> element?
[22:23:00] <sammych> next()
[22:23:09] <sammych> $el.next()
[22:23:27] <jorvis_> and previous() ?
[22:23:32] <jphase> and if you absolutely had to use it in a selector you could do it the same way css does it
[22:23:34] <jorvis_> That's easy
[22:23:35] <jphase> .prev
[22:23:39] <jphase> ()
[22:24:06] <sammych> jphase: generally, double quotes are exact quotes, single quotes are everything else spoken in that characters voice
[22:24:18] <sammych> well, that's not right
[22:24:24] <jphase> hah, that's the english language, not programming
[22:24:38] <jphase> that's why I'm pro-'
[22:24:50] <sammych> well, nothing fuzzy in programming, you have to program in fuzzy
[22:25:08] <jphase> ooo, that'd be a good language name
[22:25:18] <jphase> #!/bin/fuzzy
[22:25:26] <sammych> #fuzzy
[22:25:45] <robertmaxrees> "i need to kind of do a thing, sort of"
[22:25:52] <jphase> lol
[22:26:00] <robertmaxrees> you can't directly describe what you want, just be generic about it.
[22:26:05] <sammych> var i = 1 + 1 // i ~ 2
[22:26:23] <sammych> no more equals oper, just ~
[22:26:24] <jphase> any xchat users here?
[22:26:45] <tw2113> xchat-aqua on osx
[22:27:03] <jphase> perhaps it's the same, you know how to switch between chans tw2113 ?
[22:27:19] <jphase> via keyboard that is.... #l2p
[22:27:24] <tw2113> cmd+#
[22:27:41] <tw2113> # equating to the order of the rooms you have joined
[22:27:46] <tw2113> i keep my rooms at the bottom
[22:27:58] <jphase> #fail for me :[
[22:28:16] <jphase> granted, the only reason I'm asking is 'cause I'm back to my linux desktop instead of my mac
[22:28:17] <robertmaxrees> ctrl+tab or cmd+tab or something similar might work, too.
[22:28:28] <jphase> tried that too, and the ctrl + [
[22:28:29] <jphase> etc.
[22:28:35] <jphase> also arrows lol
[22:28:54] <tw2113> ctrl+#
[22:29:26] <jphase> did that, both the literal ctrl + shift + 3 and also just ctrl + (any number)
[22:30:06] <robertmaxrees> what about alt+#
[22:30:24] <jphase> ooooo
[22:30:28] <jphase> robertmaxrees++;
[22:30:32] <jphase> thx :D
[22:30:41] <robertmaxrees> i don't event use xchat hahaha
[22:30:42] <tw2113> alt+rtfm
[22:30:48] <robertmaxrees> what about ctril+tab?
[22:30:49] <tw2113> :P
[22:30:54] <robertmaxrees> that should work, too.
[22:30:58] <jphase> that seems counter-intuitive to me since alt = os level and ctrl = application level
[22:31:11] <jphase> so I'd hope I wouldn't be in the rtfm crew
[22:31:35] <jphase> granted, I've been using cmd for so long perhaps it's changed in the last 4 years?
[22:31:50] <jphase> I only use regular keyboards within a linux terminal :\
[22:32:39] <Uhkis> alt = os, ctrl = application?
[22:32:44] <Uhkis> where does this come from
[22:33:28] <jphase> Uhkis, the dawn of computing with regular keyboards
[22:33:51] <jphase> i.e. ctrl + f4 = close a window within current application.... vs.   alt + f4 = close current application
[22:34:14] <jphase> all subsequent commands alternate between application and os based on alt vs. ctrl
[22:34:24] <jphase> (typically)  -  granted, I just got schooled on that
[22:34:34] <jphase> but this is CentOS and xchat so not sure how that applies
[22:35:13] <Uhkis> i can't think of any other example of that really
[22:35:42] <robertmaxrees> alt+tab vs ctrl+tab
[22:36:05] <jphase> same with arrows
[22:36:07] <Uhkis> true, ^tab doesnt do anything
[22:36:25] <jphase> also, same with every shortcut
[22:36:30] <Uhkis> not true, alt+arrow changes window on irssi, ctrl+arrow changes tab on konsole
[22:36:31] <robertmaxrees> arrows don't do anything for me on windows.
[22:36:49] <robertmaxrees> ctrl vs alt, i mean.
[22:36:55] <jphase> yeah, when you're talking about irssi and konsole we're basically out of context hehe
[22:37:09] <jphase> we're literally talking about a methodology that microshit implemented
[22:37:31] <Uhkis> i just realized there's so many stacks of apps when ssh irssi'ng
[22:37:41] <jphase> I miss irssi
[22:37:50] <Uhkis> konsole - konsole tab - zsh - ssh - bash - screen - irssi - irssis windows :D
[22:37:50] <jphase> I may go back tbh
[22:38:24] <tw2113> i'm still a bash user
[22:38:45] <Uhkis> ofc there's X and kde before konsole.. :)
[22:39:32] <jphase> I'm pretty boring with my gui - still use a vanilla gnome on centos
[22:39:42] <jphase> helps me stay consistent with my production environments :\
[22:39:46] <Uhkis> kde on gentoo :-)
[22:40:02] * jphase wonders what kde is like these days
[22:40:09] <jphase> it's been like........... 5 years?
[22:40:28] <jphase> I still install random kde apps on gnome when they're obviously superior
[22:40:40] <Uhkis> graphically pretty much the same, but more stable and faster
