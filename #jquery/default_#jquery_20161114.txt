[02:51:30] <ahoo> has mobile and ui been merged already?
[02:52:07] <Cork> no, and there is no plan to as far as i know
[02:58:14] <ahoo> thx
[03:09:43] <lenswipee> hi
[03:39:28] <henk_> hi
[05:12:23] <Arcarc> Is it possible to somehow do $elem.append('tr.empty') instead of $elem.append('<tr class="empty">')?
[05:12:38] <Arcarc> Seems like the Sizzle element selector should have the ability to go both ways
[05:13:18] <Arcarc> The above doesn't work, but I'm wondering if there's a workaround or something
[05:15:36] <AdamPDotty> Thos two commands do totally different things.
[05:16:09] <AdamPDotty> e
[05:16:20] <Arcarc> So you're saying the first one actually does something? What does it do?
[05:16:29] <AdamPDotty> plus: avoid "doesn't work"
[05:16:55] <AdamPDotty> It looks for <tr>s with class empty and appends them to your element.
[05:17:27] <Arcarc> Ahh, I see.
[05:17:49] <Arcarc> But is it possible to convert the selector to a (new) HTML element?
[05:18:50] <Arcarc> So I can use the same variable to find the newly created element again (using the selector)
[05:19:29] <AdamPDotty> You could use the "old" way. tr = document.createElement('tr');
[05:19:58] <AdamPDotty> tr.className= "empty";
[05:21:27] <Arcarc> Hmm, not the superclean solution I was hoping existed, but fair enough. Thanks!
[06:25:44] <Onepamopa> can someone tell me how to match: <li class="test"> <a href="#"> </li> ? I want to call a .clicl(function() on the "a"
[06:42:08] <AdamPDotty> $('li.test').find('a') -> $('li.test').on('click', 'a', handler);
[07:00:27] <Cork> Onepamopa: the correct selector depends on the context
[07:00:59] <Cork> if there are more occurances then this, or any of these elements are dynamically added are two things that matters for example
[07:01:20] <Cork> so more info is needed for a correct answer
[07:18:08] <lilalinux> How do you mimic FormData.entries in jquery? (it's not supported in safari)
[07:21:33] <Cork> lilalinux: those methods are all really new
[07:21:49] <Cork> for example they aren't supported in firefox 43 or chrome 49
[07:22:01] <lilalinux> that's why I ask about mimicing them :-)
[07:22:03] <Cork> so i would avoid relaying on them all together
[07:22:06] <Cork> you can't
[07:22:14] <lilalinux> oops
[07:22:19] <Cork> formdata before the new spec is a one way solution
[07:22:29] <Cork> you can push data into it, but never get anything out
[07:22:39] <lilalinux> i see
[07:22:43] <lilalinux> thank you
[07:22:46] <Cork> (it is meant as a container you build and then hand it over to xhr)
[07:22:56] <Cork> so only the browser can read from it
[07:23:07] <lilalinux> then I'll have to shove it into another thingie additionally
[07:23:32] <Cork> better store it somewhere else and build the form data object when you are ready to send it
[07:23:39] <lilalinux> good point
[07:23:52] <Cork> the only real reason to use form data is when you want to xhr push files
[07:24:03] <lilalinux> could that be problematic with file uploads?
[07:24:23] <lilalinux> IIRC that's the reason I took FormData in the first place
[07:24:26] <Cork> you have to use a form data to submit files
[07:24:41] <Cork> but you can store the file reference and then append it to the form data later
[07:24:48] <Cork> so no it is fine
[07:28:08] <Popzi__> http://jsfiddle.net/y4yAP/1437/  how can I make this work for BOTH images? :o
[07:45:03] <Cork> Popzi__: use $(this)
[07:45:30] <Cork> also you can't use the same id on more then one element
[07:46:57] <Cork> Popzi__: http://jsfiddle.net/y4yAP/1438/
[07:47:21] <Cork> or better yet, delegate the event handler to a static parent instead of duplicate it on each image
[08:06:02] <ROBIN_> Hi, could someone please assist me to do the same thing using jquery and json as http://jsfiddle.net/kasperfish/r7MN9/3/
[08:19:03] <Popzi__> sorry was afk, thanks alot Cork! :D
[08:23:13] <Caspan> is there a way to catch when any text is added or removed from a search box?
[08:23:19] <Caspan> i was using keyup
[08:23:42] <Caspan> but it does not catch pastes and when uses click the x in the browser to clear the text box
[08:23:58] <Arcarc> $('.searchBox').on('input', function() {});
[08:25:04] <Caspan> perfect
[08:25:11] <Caspan> what is the .on input function
[08:25:23] <Caspan> does that mean anythign changes in the input box?
[08:25:47] <Arcarc> Yep
[08:26:27] <Caspan> will that also fire if i set text in the box via JS
[08:26:33] <Caspan> or only when the users doe sit>
[08:26:37] <Caspan> does it ?
[08:26:51] <Caspan> .trigger i am assuming for when i set it using JS
[08:27:31] <Arcarc> It should reasonably fire when it's set via JS as well
[08:27:38] <Caspan> thank you
[08:55:36] <Caspan> I asked this is #css but thought I would ask here to.. I am using .fadeout on some search terms so if its does nto match the search the items fade out
[08:55:49] <Caspan> the other elements will fill in the white space after that
[08:56:05] <Caspan> but they move into the white space very quickly
[08:56:16] <Caspan> is there a way to slow this down so it looks a bit better
[08:56:40] <Caspan> http://bbref.ca use the search bar to search for 'pearl'
[08:57:05] <Cork> Caspan: i would recommend using css3 transition and transition-delay
[08:57:06] <Caspan> youll see the remaining objects jump very quickly to fill the whitespace left but the items that faded out
[08:57:29] <Cork> for one it makes the animation smoother (as the browser can optimize it)
[08:57:30] <Caspan> Cork: will that work when an object is not transforming though?
[08:57:36] <Cork> and it makes it easier to manage
[08:57:52] <Cork> Caspan: not transforming?
[08:57:59] <Cork> you would control it by a class
[08:58:00] <Caspan> well these items have no CSS changing
[08:58:15] <Caspan> they are just filling in the whitespace left by elemetns that faded out
[08:58:21] <Cork> have a matching class or something like that
[11:29:09] <d10magic> What is that alert that is above all divisions?
[11:29:41] <sharang> Hello,I am Sharan Girdhani and I am pursuing ........ from ..... I am interested in contributing to the <<ORG NAME>> in order to participate in the upcoming Google Summer of Code. Please suggest how to get started.    Thank you,
[11:30:19] <taplar> wow, is it just me or is that like a very bad bot message...
[11:30:38] <d10magic> taplar, u know ?
[11:31:03] <taplar> d10magic: all i saw was your question about an alert.  no relevant code
[11:31:39] <sharang> Hello,   I am Sharan Girdhani and I am pursuing Masters in CS from University of North Carolina, Charlotte. I am interested in contributing to jQuery Foundation in order to participate in the upcoming Google Summer of Code. Please suggest how to get started.    Thank you,
[11:32:29] <taplar> http://contribute.jquery.org/ or hitup #jquery-dev
[11:33:44] <sharang> taplar: thank you
[11:47:28] <Forbidd3n> Is it possible to have a method that makes ajax call and then return that and apply different success methods. For example function ajaxCall(url, data){ return $.ajax(...); } then in my $(document).on('beforeSubmit', '.form', function(){ ajaxCall('http', {data}).success(function(){ do something here });
[11:49:48] <Forbidd3n> I basically want to create one single ajax method and have different successes versus doing $.ajax in multiple spots
[11:50:32] <taplar> Forbidd3n: yep, you can do that
[11:50:47] <Forbidd3n> taplar: is my syntax corret?
[11:50:49] <Forbidd3n> correct
[11:51:25] <taplar> looks right
[11:51:32] <Forbidd3n> thanks will give it a try
[11:53:12] <taplar> i've done some stuff like that in the past, where i had some common callbacks that i attached to every call.
[12:04:56] <lilalinux> Is there sth like a 'not in' operator for selectors on attributes? e.h. $([name!=("Foo","Bar")])
[12:05:18] <taplar> use filter() insteade
[12:05:19] <robertmaxrees> why not use filter?
[12:05:22] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:05:30] <robertmaxrees> functions have hella flxibility and stuff.
[12:05:38] <lilalinux> k
[12:05:41] <lilalinux> thx
[12:12:03] <lilalinux> can filter return all removed elements?
[12:12:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd return the inverse of your selection.
[12:14:14] <sharang> Hello,   I am Sharan Girdhani and I am pursuing Masters in CS from University of North Carolina, Charlotte.  I am interested in contributing to JQuery in order to participate in the upcoming Google Summer of Code. Please suggest how to get started.    Thank you
[12:14:38] <robertmaxrees> sharang head over to #jquery-dev for that :)
[12:15:23] <sharang> robertmaxrees: thank you
[12:15:36] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[12:15:43] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[12:29:09] <GeekMonkey> any solution to get an iframe responsive on ios?
[12:29:42] <hlve> ..css?
[12:29:45] <hlve> lol
[12:30:59] <GeekMonkey> hopefully
[12:31:57] <GeekMonkey> css or js or js/css combo ... any thoughts hive?
[12:32:36] <taplar> responsive how?
[12:33:37] <robertmaxrees> "iframe responsive" sounds like some kind of weird question.
[12:34:19] <robertmaxrees> like, something you'd use to throw somebody off.
[12:35:15] <taplar> like #boycotttwitter
[12:36:09] <GeekMonkey> it works fine on android but on ios tablets the content inside continues to stretch unless there is a pixel value for the iframe
[12:37:06] <taplar> so maybe a ##css question
[12:37:23] <GeekMonkey> taplar... I asked there too... no answer
[12:37:25] <robertmaxrees> GeekMonkey why are you using iframes btw?
[12:39:27] <GeekMonkey> embedding a site that has a video game on it... the client doesn't want them to leave the page
[12:39:38] <GeekMonkey> got a better solution?
[12:39:56] <robertmaxrees> users have to click a link to get to the game anyway.
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean leave the site?
[12:41:53] <GeekMonkey> yes
[12:41:55] <GeekMonkey> leave the site
[12:42:04] <robertmaxrees> is it abranded game or something?
[12:42:06] <GeekMonkey> they play the game inside the iframe
[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> confused about why it needs to be on another domain.
[12:42:27] <GeekMonkey> no it is opensource but it is hosted on another domain
[12:47:23] <GeekMonkey> robertmaxrees... so no solution....
[12:48:05] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm confused about the problem :) but resizing the iframe itself should correct whatever issues you've been seeing.  otherwise, i'd just hit up #css and see if somebody in there has any ideas
[12:48:26] <hlve> (◕◡◕)
[12:48:34] <taplar> bugs!
[12:48:48] <taplar> from a hive!
[12:48:51] <taplar> nice
[12:49:29] * hlve puts his stunner shades on
[12:51:07] * taplar hangs up his bug zapper and grabs a beer
[12:51:24] <taplar> i should get one of those now that i have a place
[12:52:20] <taplar> it'd be cool if they had them in like tiki torch form that were solar powered.  *goes to google*
[12:52:47] <hlve> lol
[12:53:01] <taplar> nyce
[12:53:07] <hlve> careful, taplar. last time I tried to have a regular conversation in here, I got yelled at.
[12:53:12] <hlve> >:
[12:53:24] <taplar> that's cause your not an idiot
[12:53:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:53:27] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[12:53:30] <taplar> they give me a pass some times
[12:53:35] <hlve> lol
[12:53:45] <taplar> boom https://www.amazon.com/Jepop-Electronic-Mosquito-Powered-Outdoor/dp/B01H6NMVDM/ref=sr_1_7/167-9376016-2276940?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1479145967&sr=1-7&keywords=solar+powered+bug+zapper
[12:53:54] <taplar> weekend project
[12:59:30] <PCatinean> Hey guys
[12:59:58] <taplar> yo
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> haaay
[13:00:10] <taplar> there could be girls in here...
[13:00:16] <PCatinean> Between loading 5 images in a frontend and using show/hide and z-index to make a final image is it better to do it like this or have a method on the serverside which computes the images and passes the final value?
[13:00:23] <PCatinean> lol taplar :))
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:00:36] <hlve> hay untriggered ladies and gents*
[13:00:39] <robertmaxrees> passes the final value....
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> to what?
[13:00:50] <taplar> you mean compose an image, vs just providing a single image?
[13:01:43] <PCatinean> taplar, there you, sorry speaking idiot today
[13:01:48] <PCatinean> there you go*
[13:01:59] <taplar> what kinda file size we talking about?
[13:01:59] <hlve> "speaking idiot today"
[13:02:09] <taplar> and are any of the sub images duplicates?
[13:03:33] <PCatinean> Not sure about size, I guess nothing humongous. Not sure why there would be duplicates tho'?
[13:03:36] <plamb_> can you .toggleClass on an elem that has no classes?
[13:03:39] <PCatinean> There shouldn't be
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ yep
[13:03:50] <robertmaxrees> it'll just add that class.
[13:03:59] <taplar> mmm, well, from a network standpoint 1 file would probably be better
[13:04:18] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean what are you building?  maybe some context would help?
[13:05:39] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, it's a product configurator. You set an image on each option in the backend as transparent png. Then you set a z-index for all options in the backend. And when you start selecting options the final image is displayed by combining all the selections  and layering over eachother
[13:05:59] <PCatinean> taplar, I thought that would be one, and I think much easier since I have to implement it in two places
[13:05:59] <robertmaxrees> ah that thing.
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> you using node.js?
[13:06:17] <PCatinean> no not really :-s
[13:06:20] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[13:06:24] <PCatinean> Tho' a lot of people seem to be very into it lately
[13:06:31] <PCatinean> Many saying it's the "next big thing"
[13:06:32] <robertmaxrees> you'll want to implement that server and client side.
[13:06:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:06:38] <PCatinean> :))
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> we're past it being the "next big thing"
[13:06:45] <taplar> my reasoning was more based on latency and such
[13:06:46] <robertmaxrees> it's one of the current big things.
[13:07:01] <PCatinean> as in it's going to explode I've understood
[13:07:05] <PCatinean> taplar, and from other standpoints?
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> and you'll need to implement some of that logic twice - render it correctly on pageload.
[13:07:10] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean it already has exploded.
[13:07:22] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, and I'm stuck with python :(
[13:07:23] <hlve> stop exploding things, robertmaxrees
[13:07:36] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, what do you mean by logic twice?
[13:07:42] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean python's a great language.
[13:07:52] <hlve> with ugly markup.
[13:07:53] <PCatinean> :D
[13:07:58] <PCatinean> ney, markup is <3
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean maybe i'm not understanding the problem hahaha
[13:08:25] <hlve> yeah. a markup made up entirely of indents in awkward places
[13:08:31] <hlve> that's exactly what i want.
[13:08:33] * hlve shudders
[13:08:46] <PCatinean> I don't know in my mind it's very simple. All the images you place should be the exact same size and transparent png, you set the order on them. And it just retrieves the image from the option and places it in the z-index specified
[13:08:55] <PCatinean> hlve, hehe :)))
[13:09:06] <hlve> i haven't been hehe'd in awhile.
[13:09:08] <hlve> thank you for that
[13:09:17] <PCatinean> =)))
[13:09:18] * PCatinean lols
[13:09:22] <taplar> this room is strange now days
[13:09:29] <hlve> s/room/life
[13:09:30] <PCatinean> ahh I love IRC. Best thing since dial-up
[13:09:51] <hlve> IRC was around then, too.
[13:10:20] <hlve> IRC is like that awkward growing whisker on my dogs upper right cheek. It's always been there.. and I don't know why
[13:10:31] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:10:55] <taplar> ok, so you are thinking about stacking images, yes?
[13:11:32] <hlve> why stack them and not just change the SRC?
[13:11:38] <hlve> am I not understanding the question?
[13:11:43] <taplar> idk, i'm playing in his scenario
[13:11:53] <hlve> I don't understand his scenario.
[13:12:06] <hlve> PCatinean, jdfiddle?
[13:12:15] <hlve> jsfiddle*
[13:12:36] <robertmaxrees> he's building a product configurator.
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to find a way to show the final, configured product and the user goes.
[13:12:57] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees got it yah :D
[13:13:01] <hlve> so change the SRC..
[13:13:01] <robertmaxrees> so he's going to try layering photos on top of each other to show that.
[13:13:08] <PCatinean> aye!
[13:13:09] <hlve> OH
[13:13:12] <taplar> how much reuse of images is there?
[13:13:14] <robertmaxrees> there could be a variable number of layers.
[13:13:17] <hlve> I understand
[13:13:25] <hlve> That's more CSS than it is JS though, no?
[13:13:26] <robertmaxrees> and layer order will be important.
[13:13:34] <robertmaxrees> because some layhers will need to be over others.
[13:13:45] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean what sorts of products are you configuring here?
[13:13:52] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, in theory it should be everything
[13:14:02] * hlve ponders everything
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> like amazon-level?
[13:14:08] <PCatinean> hahha :)))
[13:14:15] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that's going to get really difficult.
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> because your data will have to store some kind of reference about the order layers wouldf go in.
[13:14:34] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, it's a python framework with a web-server and you can extend it to do anything
[13:14:46] <PCatinean> So I'm offering the base functionality that you can later extend yourself
[13:14:52] <PCatinean> Not a "one-size" fits all for everything
[13:15:11] <hlve> dude what is even going on right now.
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean just pointing out some problems you'll have with it.
[13:15:57] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, yeah I know but I'm not sure what I'm missing because in my mind it's simple. 1 attribute -> n values. you set the sequence/order/z-index per attribute and when in the frontend you pick an option of an atribute it just goes to the corresponding index
[13:15:59] <PCatinean> z-index*
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> right - storing that order is the pain there :)
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> novel idea though.
[13:16:39] <PCatinean> The scope here was requested by a customer that sells coats or something similar, and he has like 20 colors for the material, and 15 colors for the buttons. It's impossible to make all the image combinations and he wants to use this instead
[13:16:55] <PCatinean> :))
[13:17:02] <robertmaxrees> it'
[13:17:11] <robertmaxrees> *it's possible to make the images but fair enough :)
[13:17:22] <PCatinean> haha :)) it is indeed, just painfull
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> nah.  you could automate that.
[13:18:24] <taplar> iirc we don't show all the colors available in our images.  or maybe we do.  i know we list the available colors
[13:18:40] <robertmaxrees> we do that, too.
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> we can't possibly have images for every single color, but we try to get each variation when possible.
[13:19:14] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, I was thinking the same approach
[13:19:41] <robertmaxrees> i showed you what we do.  not perfect.  i'd love to see somebody else figure this out though.
[13:20:41] <PCatinean> I'm thinking since the images are stored in the backend along with the option ids, I just sent the configuration code, and python will extract the images process them and layer them and return the final image
[13:21:34] <robertmaxrees> that's one way to do it.
[13:21:37] <taplar> depending on how heavy that is, you might want to look into some sort of temp storage for the generated images
[13:22:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:22:12] <robertmaxrees> cache the common ones.
[13:22:16] <PCatinean> taplar, a very good idea, kinda like a cache for common ones
[13:22:19] <PCatinean> exactly :D
[13:22:36] <Deusdeorum> where am I failing this .get call? http://pastebin.com/798Y9tk5
[13:23:05] <Deusdeorum> scroll function works fine, i want to extend the html with more divs so i am using this call to retrieve more data
[13:24:10] <taplar> what isn't working with the get request?  btw, use console.log(), not alert()
[13:24:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:25:01] <robertmaxrees> also: do you mean the get call itself is failing?  check your network tab to see if the data is valid.
[13:27:02] <Deusdeorum> ops, it is not failing, sorry.. TypeError: <my_query_db> is not JSON serializable
[13:27:10] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[13:27:13] <Deusdeorum> :D
[13:27:28] <taplar> side note
[13:27:35] <taplar> scroll happens a ton
[13:27:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:27:43] <taplar> and your doing multiple wrappings inside it
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> throttle and cache.
[13:27:52] <taplar> ^
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> or debounce
[13:28:57] <Deusdeorum> how does facebook, twitter etc handle scrolls and retrieving data?
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> similar to what you're doing.
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> but your code is going to get really slow.
[13:30:33] <Deusdeorum> why? mind pushing a layman like me into the right direction?
[13:30:54] <taplar> ok, so every time a user scrolls, the event fires multiple times
[13:31:01] <taplar> you can put a console log in there to see
[13:31:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:31:13] <taplar> and every time you do that, your doing $() stuff
[13:31:18] <Deusdeorum> no, only when you hit the bottom of the page?
[13:31:20] <taplar> which is creating a new jQuery object every time
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> the event handler itself still fires.
[13:31:35] <taplar> you're doing your evaluation to know if you've reached that
[13:31:43] <Deusdeorum> you are right.. hmm
[13:31:50] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:31:52] <taplar> ton of scrolls + lots of new $() = GC nightmare
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you a few strategies to mitigate some of that.
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> oh and as an aside, never use ==
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> always use ===
[13:32:55] <Deusdeorum> true, not so nice.. thanks for explaining it to me!
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> are you already using underscore.js?
[13:35:04] <Deusdeorum> nopes, nothing
[13:35:44] <Deusdeorum> but I guess I could, have to read up though
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> nah no need.
[13:36:41] <taplar> lodash also has what i think your pulling in.  dunno if it is smaller than underscore
[13:37:12] <robertmaxrees> not any more iirc.
[13:37:13] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/08bda9990804
[13:37:19] <robertmaxrees> can just implement your own throuttle.
[13:39:40] <taplar> heh, i usually do a poor man's throttle with one()
[13:39:51] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> that's another way.
[13:40:28] <Deusdeorum> wow, cool.. throttle will limit the events? am I understanding it right then?
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so basically it limits how frequently it fires.
[13:40:55] <taplar> 'processes'
[13:41:06] <taplar> the events still happen
[13:41:07] <robertmaxrees> so as the user scrolls, it'll fire every 100ms or whatever you confused.
[13:41:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:41:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah always fire.  that part never changes.  is the handler that becomes a problem.
[13:41:58] <Deusdeorum> nice, thank you guys
[13:43:23] <Deusdeorum> never really thought about it but now when you explained it makes sense
[13:45:41] <PCatinean> you guys ever opened the console on facebook?
[13:45:44] <PCatinean> I was surprised :))
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> yep :)\
[13:46:10] <plamb_> can you call jquery inside the creation of a javascript object
[13:46:12] <plamb_> i.e.
[13:46:13] <plamb_> var addedData = {type:$parent.find('.type')}
[13:46:23] <robertmaxrees> plamb_ you can call it anywhere.
[13:46:25] <robertmaxrees> it's javascript :)
[13:46:28] <taplar> yep
[13:46:36] <plamb_> cool
[13:47:24] <hlve> taplar is cool
[13:47:29] <taplar> lies
[13:48:08] <plamb_> err
[13:48:14] <plamb_> it needs to return a string though
[13:48:21] <plamb_> so probably .find('..').text()
[13:48:24] <plamb_> right?
[13:48:36] <taplar> what is 'type'?
[13:48:48] <hlve> the type of $el
[13:48:54] <taplar> no, node type
[13:49:01] <hlve> >:/
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> why are you storing the node type?
[13:49:29] <taplar> ah, you confuzzled me, lol
[13:55:37] <plamb_> hmm
[13:55:53] <plamb_> trying to figure out how to send an uploaded image over ajax
[13:55:59] <plamb_> but i guess this isnt the chan for that
[13:56:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you can ask.
[13:56:16] <robertmaxrees> depends on browser support.
[13:58:16] <hlve> Just don't support IE9.
[13:58:18] <hlve> you'll be golden.
[13:58:20] <hlve> 4 life.
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> heh we still support back to 8.
[13:58:34] <hlve> Oh god.
[13:58:35] <hlve> I'm sorry.
[13:58:39] <robertmaxrees> it's actually not that bad.
[13:58:40] <hlve> No React.js for you.
[13:58:56] <robertmaxrees> we don't do pixel perfect and allow graceful degredation.
[13:59:16] <hlve> how do you gracefully degrade functionality?
[13:59:17] <hlve> lol
[13:59:23] <hlve> "Sorry, your shit is old."
[13:59:34] <robertmaxrees> if it's not required for purchase, it's not a big deal.
[13:59:38] <robertmaxrees> rounded borders?  who cares.
[13:59:42] <hlve> ;p
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> all sorts of stuff like that.
[14:12:05] <Forbidd3n> When using this the modal content area is not cleared - $('body').on('hidden.bs.modal', '.applicationModal', function () { $(this).removeData('bs.modal'); });
[14:12:07] <Forbidd3n> any ideas?
[14:13:22] <taplar> 'removeData' ?
[14:13:32] <hlve> yeah, what is removeData?
[14:13:32] <hlve> lol
[14:13:38] <hlve> .empty?
[14:14:25] <plamb_> whats the right way to grab the file entered in an <input type="file"> ? $('input[type="file"]').files[0] ?
[14:14:53] <taplar> looks familiar
[14:15:00] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[14:15:12] <taplar> give it a class/id though
[14:15:20] <hlve> ^
[14:15:37] <hlve> @plamb_, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8436315/jquery-file-attributes good read through regarding .files
[14:16:04] <plamb_> so im missing the leading [0]
[14:16:15] <taplar> or use prop()
[14:16:30] <hlve> .prop("files")[0] would be fine, too
[14:16:31] <taplar> $( '#newfile' ).prop( 'files' )[ 0 ];
[14:17:02] <plamb_> the input has a property called "files" after a file is selected?
[14:17:11] <hlve> but target it correctly, assign it an ID, or give it a data-attribute that you can target via jQ... not just an input type file
[14:17:28] <taplar> input type of file probably starts off with an empty array of files
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> hlve data attributes are as good for selecting on as attributes.
[14:17:31] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[14:17:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:17:45] <hlve> I like data-attributes.
[14:17:58] <hlve> you can target them just as you can any other selector
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> they're ggreat for storing dsata.
[14:18:04] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:18:08] <taplar> can =/= should
[14:18:11] <hlve> lol
[14:18:15] <robertmaxrees> you can target them the same way you target other attributes, except they're weaker for it.
[14:18:26] <robertmaxrees> because you can set/change them in different ways.
[14:18:29] <hlve> better than targeting a blanket input[type]
[14:18:30] <taplar> especially when you through in jquery
[14:18:31] <hlve> lol
[14:19:09] <hlve> why is it weaker for it? if the attribute never changes
[14:19:15] <taplar> $('#x').data('me, 'yay'); $('[data-me="yay"]') <-- may not return
[14:19:17] <robertmaxrees> they can cahnge.
[14:19:24] <Forbidd3n> taplar: when I do .empty() it doesn't allow the modal to work again.
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> and if you use .data(), things get weirder.
[14:19:31] <robertmaxrees> plus data isn't meant for selecting.
[14:19:38] <robertmaxrees> if you really need to use it though, use .filter()
[14:19:47] <hlve> <input data-formFileSelector blah blah blah>
[14:19:52] <Forbidd3n> I have preventDefault and return false on this, but still submits form - $(document).on('beforeSubmit', '.applicationForm',
[14:19:58] <hlve> you can just target [data-formFileSelector]
[14:20:07] <robertmaxrees> use a class at that point.
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> don't use data attributes to select on.
[14:20:15] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:20:20] <hlve> an ID. classes are to be used multiple times.
[14:20:38] <robertmaxrees> or a class.
[14:20:40] <hlve> we used to use data-id's for selectors
[14:20:45] <hlve> meh
[14:21:03] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea tbh
[14:21:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:21:11] <robertmaxrees> they're slow slow slow for selecting.
[14:21:12] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:21:41] <hlve> the startup imploded anyways
[14:21:49] <hlve> I got laid off with 60 other devs
[14:21:50] <hlve> >:
[14:23:44] <JonelethIrenicus> how can i make sure button() items generated dynamically are actually made into buttons
[14:23:49] <JonelethIrenicus> ?
[14:24:12] <JonelethIrenicus> like through an ajax call
[14:24:35] <JonelethIrenicus> currently my button has the class but doesn't have the button styling, or even the trigger attached.
[14:25:25] <taplar> JonelethIrenicus: would have to see a jsfiddle or something of what you are doing.  dynamically created elements are not going to have anything attached to them unless you do so
[14:30:11] <JonelethIrenicus> $(".save_inspection").button().click(function (e) {
[14:30:17] <JonelethIrenicus> that is what I am doing
[14:30:28] <taplar> when?
[14:30:31] <JonelethIrenicus> when i add HTML via an ajax call my newly created button isn't attached
[14:30:44] <taplar> right
[14:30:52] <JonelethIrenicus> what is the proper method?
[14:30:53] <taplar> $() only finds elements in the DOM at that point in time
[14:30:59] <JonelethIrenicus> ahh
[14:31:11] <taplar> try using a delegated binding instead
[14:31:26] <JonelethIrenicus> example?
[14:31:33] <taplar> learn.jquery.com/delegate
[14:31:48] <taplar> crap
[14:31:57] <taplar> i was going to be happy if I pulled that straight out of the air, one sec
[14:32:29] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:32:39] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com/on#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:32:42] <taplar> make sure the read the whole thing
[14:32:43] <robertmaxrees> i have that one memorized.
[14:32:46] <JonelethIrenicus> ahh i found it
[14:32:46] <taplar> lol
[14:33:03] <JonelethIrenicus> but how do i also make it button?
[14:33:15] <taplar> you're going to have to call that on the new guys as you make them
[14:37:28] <taplar> i hate you data tables
[14:42:45] <taplar> and i don't hate things
[14:42:52] <taplar> but there are exceptions
[14:43:02] <robertmaxrees> like datatables
[14:43:08] <taplar> and rightly so, :)
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahha
[14:47:03] <taplar> did i show you the last meme we made?  with the alien guy?
[14:47:14] <robertmaxrees> i... don't remember haha
[14:52:19] <taplar> should have bookmarked it.  lot more chrome memes that i would have thought...
[14:53:29] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[14:55:56] <taplar> it was like https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder597/500x/73164597.jpg
[14:56:16] <robertmaxrees> i mean - that's legit.
[14:56:25] <taplar> it's on our wall now, heh
[14:57:08] <taplar> came up when some of our QAs were testing some wysiwyg logic in ff and chrome
[14:57:23] <taplar> paste in some html in ff, and it stayed text
[14:57:32] <taplar> did the same thing in chrome, suddenly it's markup
[14:57:43] <taplar> that was the reason we came back with, :)
[14:58:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[14:58:23] <robertmaxrees> it's not wrong.
[14:58:55] <arc_> i've had the opposite happen many times as well ;)
[15:00:10] <taplar> oh used to be we loved chrome
[15:02:02] <hlve> Mozilla is in bed with the government. I'm all set with Firefox.
[15:02:04] <hlve> <_<
[15:07:17] <taplar> wait, wha?
[15:08:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:09:45] <taplar> that's like.... the muppets suck.  jim henson all the way.
[15:12:11] <robertmaxrees> right - false first statement, then a contractictory second statement.
[15:17:38] <taplar> everyone love animal
[15:18:44] <taplar> and the sax dog
[15:19:24] <robertmaxrees> with the rest of Dr. Teeth And The Electric Mayhem
[15:19:44] <taplar> was the dog Ruff?
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> Rowlf
[15:20:30] <taplar> hah
[15:20:31] <hlve> the "i'm all set with..." means I'm done with
[15:20:37] <hlve> not that I'm okay with
[15:20:42] <hlve> not contradictory.
[15:20:52] <robertmaxrees> i've never heard it used that way.
[15:20:53] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:20:57] <taplar> uh, usually "im all set" means your good with it
[15:21:00] <hlve> o_O
[15:21:03] <taplar> like, i won the lottery.  i'm all set
[15:21:09] <taplar> (for life)
[15:21:27] <hlve> Should've added 'nonsense' at the end
[15:21:44] <robertmaxrees> so what's this about mozilla now?
[15:23:11] <hlve> Nada. I don't like companies that work so closely with the government. There was a lot of conspiracy around them allowing the government to exploit a zero day vuln. before it was made public to tackle users who use Tor.
[15:23:19] <hlve> Sketchy stuffs. that's all
[15:23:39] <hlve> even if it was for the greater good :3
[15:23:58] <robertmaxrees> where's the reporting on it?
[15:24:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd love to see some factual information on it.
[15:24:39] <hlve> i don't know *too much* about it, other than what was talked about on VICE and on ARSTECH
[15:25:05] <taplar> and which government are we talking about?
[15:25:09] <hlve> The US
[15:25:44] <hlve> anddddddddd i'm on a list
[15:25:46] <hlve> lol
[15:25:57] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:26:10] <robertmaxrees> so do you have any links to anything factual about that?
[15:26:44] <hlve> Again it's just people talking about it on ARSTECH and VICE. I don't know the truth behind it. I don't even know what's factual or not. I don't know enough about it.
[15:27:00] <MassDebates> Great reputability behind those source.
[15:27:00] <robertmaxrees> so you can't link to it?
[15:27:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:27:02] <MassDebates> sources*
[15:27:05] <hlve> I'm at work right now
[15:27:12] <MassDebates> By the way, Firefox -does- work closely with the government.
[15:27:15] <MassDebates> and -google-
[15:27:16] <hlve> and the topics it relates to aren't really... SFW
[15:27:30] <MassDebates> But that doesn't mean there's any sort of nefarious activity going on.
[15:27:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused - you'll say "no more mozilla because of things i heard" but then say "i can't really speak to it with any kind of authority".
[15:27:46] <hlve> anytime the government is involved, isn't there a chance of nefarious activity going on?
[15:27:58] <hlve> robertmaxrees,  I'll link later on when I'm home
[15:28:06] <taplar> that's true any time 'people' are involved
[15:28:07] <MassDebates> anytime -ANYONE- is involved, icnluding YOU, there is a chacne of nefarious activity.
[15:28:07] <robertmaxrees> sure, just like when any person is involved.
[15:28:12] <taplar> lmao
[15:28:12] <hlve> right
[15:28:13] <hlve> lol
[15:28:14] <MassDebates> lmao
[15:28:16] <MassDebates> taplar
[15:28:19] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees:
[15:28:25] <MassDebates> +1 and +1
[15:28:26] <taplar> group hug
[15:28:28] <hlve> just the FBI has been scrutinized lately for being overly nefarious
[15:28:31] <MassDebates> Um
[15:28:33] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[15:28:33] <MassDebates> It's the FBI.
[15:28:36] <hlve> lol
[15:28:37] <robertmaxrees> this channel.
[15:28:43] <hlve> rofl
[15:28:47] <hlve> Sorry, robertmaxrees
[15:28:55] <robertmaxrees> it's not a big deal.
[15:28:57] <robertmaxrees> just laughing.
[15:29:00] <hlve> lol
[15:29:35] <arc_> people do say "i'm all set on that" to mean they will have nothing to do with it
[15:29:46] <hlve> ^
[15:29:52] <MassDebates> hlve:  Internet Explorer is by far the least nefarious ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[15:29:52] <hlve> I thought so, I've been using that for awhile
[15:29:52] <hlve> lol
[15:29:52] <arc_> i'm sure it's in urbandictionary
[15:29:52] <robertmaxrees> i've literally never heard it used that way.
[15:30:15] <MassDebates> hlve:  Internet Explorer is definitely less nefarious than Firefox is. lmao. (Y'know, privacy) ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[15:31:00] <MassDebates> Nothing about IE on VICE, huh?
[15:31:05] <MassDebates> hahahahahahaha
[15:31:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:34:21] <hlve> lol
[15:40:14] <altab> hi, I have a problem with Google Maps JS API : the markers are blurred when I load the page with a mobile user agent (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40559143/google-maps-js-api-markers-blurred-on-android-web-browser)
[15:40:41] <robertmaxrees> "blurred"?
[15:40:50] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the markers are the wrong size then,.
[15:42:12] <fiduche> ahh it's a wonderful day
[15:43:18] <robertmaxrees> ah looks like the api resizes them for you.
[15:43:26] <robertmaxrees> are the markers you're using big enough?
[15:45:22] <altab> robertmaxrees, it's the same size
[15:45:26] <altab> 22*33
[15:45:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if the resizer is having an issue scaling them.
[15:45:48] <robertmaxrees> try using bigger originals.
[15:45:51] <robertmaxrees> and see what happens.
[15:46:28] <altab> I'm trying it
[15:58:07] <arc_> isn't that just because your phone screen is high dpi
[15:58:51] <arc_> it has to display the icons at 2-3 times the size as they are displayed on a desktop monitor. 22x33 is nowhere near big enough for an icon on mobile
[15:59:03] <altab> robertmaxrees, it works when I use a bigger size icon
[15:59:15] <altab> arc_, I simulate the mobile view with chrome dev tool
[15:59:18] <robertmaxrees> arc_ basically.  all about DPI and scaling.
[15:59:22] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[15:59:40] <robertmaxrees> because a pixel != a pixel
[16:01:46] <altab> thx a lot
[16:08:59] <arc_> hi dpi displays are quite annoying now. it's like trying to design something for print where if you don't make it exactly the same dpi as the printer, it will be blurred out or have tiny imperfections. and when you submit to the print shop, they will print your work on a random printer -_-
[16:09:34] <arc_> too bad we can't just do everything in vector
[16:29:28] <iDentity1337> I have many objects with same class but different attributes. I had to bind a click event with 'on' and selector inside function, since these objects are dinamically generated
[16:29:32] <iDentity1337> How can i select these attributes
[16:30:18] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/kcQpVFuc
[16:30:19] <iDentity1337> i tried this.
[16:30:23] <iDentity1337> throws undefined
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id')
[16:30:42] <robertmaxrees> it's a method.
[16:31:30] <iDentity1337> same :|
[16:31:38] <robertmaxrees> so do they have an id?
[16:32:36] <iDentity1337> not standard id
[16:32:40] <iDentity1337> data-id
[16:32:43] <iDentity1337> attribute.
[16:32:45] <robertmaxrees> then you want .data('id')
[16:32:54] <iDentity1337> sec i'll try
[16:32:56] <robertmaxrees> .prop('id') looks for id=""
[16:33:24] <iDentity1337> i love you.
[16:33:27] <iDentity1337> the end.
[16:33:32] <iDentity1337> no homo xD
[16:33:40] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:33:41] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:33:56] <iDentity1337> but weird, i remember using .attr without 'data-' and it worked fine
[16:34:01] <iDentity1337> or maybe i'm imagining.
[16:34:06] <iDentity1337> anyways thank you :)
[16:34:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah that wouldn't work.  and i'd avoid .attr() fwiw.
[16:34:12] <robertmaxrees> .prop() or .data()
[16:34:24] <iDentity1337> (Y)
[17:33:48] <jqueryNoob> Hi, I'm brand new to jQuery, and I'm having trouble getting my first attempt to work
[17:34:33] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[17:34:48] <robertmaxrees> try https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:34:51] <robertmaxrees> and show us your code :)
[17:35:01] <jqueryNoob> Alright, will do!
[17:36:43] <jqueryNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=45f4CooIFh
[17:37:03] <jqueryNoob> I'm simply attempting to switch the div to float left instead of right
[17:37:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5dxew3ch/
[17:37:38] <robertmaxrees> no body tags or script tags for jsfiddle :)
[17:37:49] <robertmaxrees> and your code seems to work.
[17:38:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5dxew3ch/2/ with jquery added.
[17:38:38] <jqueryNoob> Must be an issue with how I'm hooking it up then
[17:39:30] <jqueryNoob> Nothing wrong with the head tag I just pasted in, is there?
[17:43:36] <robertmaxrees> togetherjs glitches out for me.
[17:43:39] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[17:43:50] <robertmaxrees> where's the head tag?
[17:44:16] <jqueryNoob> Pasted it into the html section on the fiddle you posted w/ jquerry added
[17:44:46] <robertmaxrees> oh - you have to hit "update" and toss out the new link.
[17:45:20] <jqueryNoob> gotcha
[17:45:28] <jqueryNoob> https://jsfiddle.net/5dxew3ch/4/
[17:46:12] <jqueryNoob> Got it to work in my own jsfiddle as well, just not getting it to work when launched locally in browser.
[17:47:11] <robertmaxrees> that assumes that your file paths are right.
[17:48:04] <jqueryNoob> All files are in the same foldler
[17:48:17] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your developer tools?
[17:48:42] <jqueryNoob> Yea. I'm using np++, used it plenty of times before
[17:48:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:48:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean for your browser.
[17:49:01] <robertmaxrees> not your editor :)
[17:49:12] <jqueryNoob> oh. lol
[17:49:25] <jqueryNoob> somewhat familar. I'll look
[17:49:36] <robertmaxrees> check out the network tab and reload the page.
[17:49:44] <robertmaxrees> also check your console for errors.
[17:50:39] <jqueryNoob> Throwing this on the jquery
[17:50:40] <jqueryNoob> SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'
[17:51:28] <robertmaxrees> so check out that js file.
[17:51:33] <robertmaxrees> is it what you think it is?
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> or are you getting a 404 in the network tab for it?
[17:51:49] <jqueryNoob> It's throwing the error on line1.
[17:52:01] <jqueryNoob> Might have just realized my error
[17:52:12] <robertmaxrees> and it is?
[17:52:33] <jqueryNoob> I was using <script> tags inside the file lol
[17:52:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:52:45] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[17:52:52] <jqueryNoob> Thanks for your help man!
[17:52:59] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[18:03:42] <Bjerre> hey guys. I have a large svg file which has 26 g ID's. I want code to be run when I click on any of the ID's. The code should target the clicked ID and make stuff. My brain is not working right now and I need to find a solution to get the index of the ID and match it with my array. Any idea? https://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/phmwyw2a/
[18:05:30] <Bjerre> let's say that the [i] is set to a certain number, the correct svg ID will be triggered. How to I make this to happen for all of them?
[18:05:53] <Bjerre> In other words, make the [i] be anything between 0 to 25
[18:13:05] <taplar> can you give classes to svg elements?
[19:12:11] <hassoon> the thing here, i have a set of lines within a table element, and in each line of them, there is a <td> element containing some number, and to get every number of each line, i looped through the table's lines to get those numbers, but how to add every number to the data: section of jquery's $.ajax(), to send them all to a php file via the POST method
[19:13:00] <robertmaxrees> hassoon show us some code or something.
[19:24:47] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: see i don't like how i did it in line 20 where i wrapped every value inside an encodeURIComponent() function:  https://paste.kde.org/pjs7fk10v
[19:29:08] <robertmaxrees> what about the html?
[19:29:28] <robertmaxrees> and this is... how how i'd add those together :)
[19:30:21] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: nah doesn''t matter, i was wondering how to keep adding key:value pairs to the data: section of $.ajax() within a loop
[19:30:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:30:37] <robertmaxrees> as an array?
[19:30:43] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: yeah
[19:30:51] <robertmaxrees> also: don't put an event binding inside an another event binding.
[19:31:15] <robertmaxrees> and you can use .map().get() for this.
[19:31:33] <robertmaxrees> brb
[21:41:20] <Sal> hey, does anyone know wht the caret doesn't get animated? http://jsbin.com/cuhezapika/edit?html,css,js,output
[21:41:31] <Sal> it only shows at the end of the animation
[21:41:39] <Sal> getting crazy on it
[21:46:55] <Sal> any help?
[21:58:17] <YottaByte> hey, how can I select all of the names in the left and right tables here?: http://www.behindthename.com/top/lists/united-states/2015/100
[21:58:42] <YottaByte> something like get all of those <a></a> with the names, and then just do .html() in a forEach
[21:58:55] <YottaByte> or .each in jQuery
[22:02:33] <Sal> YottaByte, $('td > a')
[22:02:37] <Sal> that should do it
[22:03:50] <Sal> if you just want the text, then $('td > a').text();
[22:04:00] <Sal> that willr eturn an array of names
[22:07:35] <YottaByte> Sal that returns everything on one line. is there a way to do $('td > a').each(function (a, elem) { console.log(elem.html()); }); or something? (that didn't work, it says elem.html is not a function)
[22:08:06] <Sal> yes,you can use the .each on it
[22:08:25] <Sal> its returns an array
[22:12:01] <YottaByte> how?
[22:12:58] <Sal> $('td > a').each(function (idx, el) { var str = $(el).html(); console.log(str); });
[22:16:17] <YottaByte> ah, thanks. the el was an html element not a jquery one, I see
