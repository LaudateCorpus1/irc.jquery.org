[01:14:59] <cyberbrai> any one
[01:15:03] <cyberbrai> ???????????????????
[01:17:56] <robhol> Mark__: "onclick" sounds like you're trying to use the attribute on an HTML element. don't. :p use $(selector).click(function) instead
[01:18:41] <Mark__> whats the difference though?
[01:19:56] <cyberbrai> Robhol any help on my case
[01:23:31] <cyberbrai> also google for it but noything found
[01:24:18] <Uhkis> youre not making any sense cyberbrai, we cant help with that description
[01:24:29] <cyberbrai> Uhkis ok
[01:25:05] <cyberbrai> listen i have string like line 1 line 2 line 3 and i want to convert into this one --------> line #1 check auction desc↵line #2↵line #3
[01:25:22] <Uhkis> repeating it wont help either.
[01:25:36] <cyberbrai> so what kind of information you need
[01:25:51] <Uhkis> maybe show some code
[01:26:14] <cyberbrai> data coming from get Api
[01:27:06] <cyberbrai> so not possible to show you my whole long code
[01:27:32] <cyberbrai> server convert something like this         (line #1 check auction desc↵line #2↵line #3 )
[01:27:37] <Uhkis> just the part you need
[01:29:57] <cyberbrai> the part is very simple Uhkis look i have a string like (	just the part you need )  i want to convert into  (line #1 check auction desc↵line #2↵line #3 )  simple
[01:30:15] <cyberbrai> # ↵ add this one into my line
[01:30:20] <cyberbrai> let me show you
[01:30:27] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/h4axf/490/
[01:30:29] <cyberbrai> check this
[01:33:37] <cyberbrai> ok cool if you are not able to understand my question only because of lack of information
[01:34:57] <cyberbrai> so not an problem tell me only one thing uhkis how can i display (line #1 check auction desc↵line #2↵line #3 ) into html because if i show it in html it's remove the # and ↵
[01:35:16] <cyberbrai> now it's a simple question
[01:59:27] <robhol> now there's a guy who loves his Enter key
[02:00:56] <Cork> and very self centered
[02:01:05] <Cork> that was the bigger probem
[02:05:08] <Uhkis> did anyone get what he wanted? :D
[02:05:23] <Cork> he wanted a psychic
[02:05:45] <Cork> someone who could read his mind and understand what was wrong with the code he saw
[02:06:04] <Uhkis> so it wasnt just me
[02:06:22] <Cork> there was a reason i didn't say anything
[03:39:12] <Duikb00t> How can I override the default jquery ui the orange one
[03:39:12] <Duikb00t> Using !important isn't working.
[03:48:04] <Duikb00t> Jquery Masters! Where are youuu
[04:01:25] <P3nnyw1se> hi guys.. how to I make this.. so it always scrolls through the elements no matter how many there are ?
[04:01:27] <P3nnyw1se> http://jsfiddle.net/ymbtr7ce/3/
[04:01:43] <P3nnyw1se> as you can see.. if there are too many elements.. it stops when its time is running out.. without covering all
[04:08:39] <daslicht> anyone sees why the next/prev button of the frst slider is not working ?
[04:08:40] <daslicht> http://baustelle.hundwerkszeug.de/
[04:08:41] <daslicht> ?
[04:10:16] <daslicht> ahh gosh
[04:10:18] <daslicht> got it
[04:10:25] <daslicht> thanks for the supporting vibes :)
[04:13:38] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: is this what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/ymbtr7ce/4/
[04:14:57] <robhol> This is ground control to Major Tom, you've really made the graaaaade~ ♪
[04:21:02] <P3nnyw1se> http://jsfiddle.net/ymbtr7ce/3/  .. how do I make this so it always covers all elements? ..  if I add 10 lines.. I get to scroll them all .. if I add 30 .. I suppose it reaches 22 and then runs out of time
[04:22:28] <Cork> ...
[04:22:34] <Cork> P3nnyw1se: i already answered that
[05:03:24] <_noblegas_> Hi, people. I have a question. I have the application deployed on test environment and there is a production version of jquery. I need to debug ressult  of ajax request. Is there a way to somehow replace prod version with devel. version of jquery, so I could see what exactly going on inside $.ajax({}) so I could see a response.
[05:04:50] <Cork> _noblegas_: are you taking about the minified version of the jquery library?
[05:09:53] <_noblegas_> yes
[05:12:09] <_noblegas__> uh sorry, it throws me out
[05:13:28] <robhol> hmm.. In the context of a web browser - is it possible at all to modify the "apparent" location without triggering an actual navigation?
[05:14:21] <robhol> I know it should probably not be done, but still. :p
[05:15:55] <P3nnyw1se> Cork: seems like that is what I'm trying to do thx
[05:19:07] <grimgrin> hello guys
[05:19:56] <grimgrin> does anyone have an experience with blogger layouts and its widget tags?
[05:20:27] <Teonnyn> Hey there, I was wondering if anyone could identify a particular image-/-content slider on a website? I'm trying to figure out what it is precisely, but it's only labeled as Colorbox.
[05:20:28] <Cork> robhol: yes, history.pushState
[05:20:28] <Teonnyn> http://playstarbound.com/ - It's the slider on top here, on playstarbound.com
[05:20:28] <Teonnyn> Or image displayer anyway.
[05:22:15] <robhol> Cork: thanks! replaceState looks like the one I'm interested in
[05:38:13] <robhol> hm. this is getting hacky :p

[06:17:40] <jackCasper> http://pastebin.com/3STiCPsD
[06:20:16] <hapi> jackCasper: use toggleClass instead of toggle
[06:20:28] <hapi> the toggle is an old and deprecated method
[06:24:21] <Cork> hapi: no it isn't
[06:24:31] <Cork> hapi: but it isn't use like i does
[06:25:00] <Cork> hapi: .toggle as a command to toggle visibility of an element is still supported
[06:25:15] <Cork> hapi: .toggle that takes multiple functions and it "toggles" between those, are though
[06:25:57] <Cork> .toggleClass is still normally a better choice, but ya..

[07:17:47] <jackCasper> sorry I had toggle before
[07:18:03] <jackCasper> removing the . still doesn't toggle the class
[07:18:03] <Cork> toggle() doesn't take class names at all

[08:39:36] <jstoone> but it seems like there is a difference between safari/chrome and firefox, since firefox wants $("g\\:price") but others won't.

[10:17:04] <Yamba> my navigation bar is not really doing what I would like to do
[10:17:45] <Johnathan1707_> What's it doing and what would you like it to do?
[10:18:29] <Yamba> if I go to the submenu it is horizontal by the way it is always switching back to the active one
[10:18:56] <Yamba> actually I could only show it to you otherwise its little bit difficult to explain
[10:19:08] <Johnathan1707_> yea, maybe better lol
[10:19:54] <Yamba> http://codeshare.io/nq57z
[10:19:58] <Yamba> this is the code
[10:20:26] <Johnathan1707_> Can you put it in a codeine or jsfiddle?
[10:20:52] <Yamba> actually the website is live
[10:21:09] <Yamba> need to replicate the issue in jsfiddle then
[10:22:51] <Yamba> ok one sec i am doing it jsfiddle now

[11:07:22] <Turkey_Ghost> kinda sorta
[12:16:29] <Deele2> I have a container with image in background that is picture from web camera. I need to reload that image every 100 ms. I have simple script ready, that just changes background image property of container, but browser is not  being able to load images that fast and I want seamless transition between frames. Is there  a way to do that with jquery?
[12:19:58] <converge> can anyone see something wrong here ? $("#position_" + asset_id + " option:selected").val();
[16:38:08] <marrenarre> converge: Yeah, you're supposed to do .val() on the select itself.
[16:38:20] <converge> thanks
[16:38:23] <converge> gonna go
[16:39:21] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[16:45:51] <fortific1tion> Goodnight :-)
[16:47:23] <briligg> Hi. Themeroller seems to be down.
[16:47:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd let #jquery-dev know :)
[16:48:59] <briligg> ok - i've never been there before so i wasn't sure how it should be
[16:52:28] <robertmaxrees> errr, "i wasn't sure how it should be"?  meaning...?
[16:52:47] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/, right?
[16:53:34] <robertmaxrees> briligg come on back here :)
[16:53:39] <briligg> yeah, i thought maybe it just hasn't been finished. it's placeholder text, that's all i get
[16:53:43] <robertmaxrees> "down" usually means "i cannot access the page"
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> it's been finished for a while.
[16:54:01] <robertmaxrees> lipsum is used as placeholder for design stuff like that.  just examples.
[16:54:38] <civpro> hello, i am getting an Unexpected identifier
[16:54:46] <briligg> yeah... that :P
[16:54:52] <civpro> 1 second and i will pastebin my code, its not that large
[16:55:47] <briligg> i should say i know very little
[16:55:54] <robertmaxrees> briligg that's fine.
[16:56:04] <briligg> not about irc, or jquery
[16:56:44] <civpro> http://jsfiddle.net/9fnvjvsf/
[16:57:19] <civpro> im trying to setup a interval to refresh the contents of a div every 5 seconds
[16:57:50] <civpro> there are unique id's for each div and button
[16:58:00] <robertmaxrees> civpro then the data you're loading is invalid.
[16:58:33] <civpro> it would come back invalid url correct?
[16:58:41] <civpro> and it works when i close/open it, the data shows up
[16:58:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:58:44] <civpro> just on refresh
[16:58:52] <robertmaxrees> civpro right, the ajax call is getting malformed data.
[16:58:57] <civpro> ahhh
[16:58:59] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're getting that error.
[17:00:04] <civpro> data is showing up correctly when i go to the url
[17:00:12] <robertmaxrees> what does it look like?
[17:00:19] <robertmaxrees> (i can't see it so i can't verify the problem)
[17:00:20] <civpro> just a table of data
[17:00:29] <robertmaxrees> .load() expects valid html.
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> just because the browser displays it does not mean it's valid.
[17:01:16] <stevenxl> Hi everyone. I want run a jQuery function only if the page I am on is index.html.
[17:01:22] <stevenxl> How can I get the page path / url?
[17:01:32] <robhol> um
[17:01:36] <robertmaxrees> SteamWells by looking at the window.location.href
[17:01:44] <robertmaxrees> err, stevenxl
[17:01:48] <robhol> location.pathname even
[17:01:53] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[17:01:58] <robertmaxrees> a few different options.
[17:02:01] <robhol> href is the whole thing, innit?
[17:02:09] <robertmaxrees> rep.
[17:02:15] <stevenxl> robhol, according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location href is the whole thang
[17:02:22] <stevenxl> OK thanks. I'll look into pathname
[17:02:24] <stevenxl> cheeres
[17:02:25] <stevenxl> ;-)
[17:02:33] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location is a good reference.
[17:02:34] <robhol> o/
[17:02:34] <civpro> https://jsfiddle.net/9fnvjvsf/
[17:02:39] <robhol> a
[17:02:42] <civpro> that is the html from viewsource
[17:02:43] <robhol> oops.
[17:02:48] <robertmaxrees> civpro that's not HTML.
[17:02:50] <robhol> my fucking Enter key is acting up
[17:02:54] <robertmaxrees> you didn't update anything.
[17:03:00] <civpro> must of not saved
[17:03:12] <civpro> it looks refreshed on my end
[17:03:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to hit "update"
[17:03:40] <robertmaxrees> and then share the new URL.
[17:04:12] <civpro> https://jsfiddle.net/f8h2dj2w/
[17:05:00] <robertmaxrees> and the encoding and everything is good?  have you checked out your network tab?
[17:05:07] <civpro> ill do that now
[17:05:18] <robertmaxrees> also, you need to target a specific container, not the whole page.
[17:05:32] <robertmaxrees> you can't insert a whole valid page into another.
[17:06:18] <civpro> im really just trying to get it to requery the data
[17:06:22] <civpro> is there a better way?
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> civpro yes - expose the data at an endpoint and do some basic client-side templating.
[17:06:58] <civpro> i have no idea what you mean
[17:07:04] <civpro> can you give me an example?
[17:07:27] <robertmaxrees> "expose the data at an endpoint" == "make a route/url/whatever your stack uses and output JSON"
[17:07:29] <civpro> im just trying to refresh the table data
[17:07:53] <robertmaxrees> "do some basic client-side templating" == "use javascript to then render that data out into the right place on the page"
[17:07:53] <civpro> there is no way of getting it to work with raw html?
[17:08:08] <robertmaxrees> you can do that, but something tells me it's not going to work the way you want it to.
[17:08:16] <civpro> you said targeting a specific target so it doesnt grab the whole html page, how do i do that?
[17:08:25] <robertmaxrees> the docs for .load() explain how to do that.
[17:08:38] <civpro> you cant just tell me?
[17:08:54] <civpro> or is it hard to explain?
[17:08:57] <robertmaxrees> i have to do exactly what you could do :) api.jquery.com/load/#loading-page-fragments
[17:09:01] <robertmaxrees> the docs are pretty clear.
[17:09:17] <civpro> ill look, thanks
[17:09:25] <robertmaxrees> that link is exactly what you want.
[17:12:04] <civpro> so it looks like it filters out automatically the stuff i dont want
[17:12:16] <civpro> i targeted the #divResponse and the same error occurs
[17:12:40] <civpro> setInterval($(collapseid).load("RingtailUpgradeStatus_log.aspx?Name=AUT01 #divResponse"), 5000);
[17:12:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then the response is invalid.  check out the network tab and see what it can tell you.  otherwise, the "right way" to do this is what I was talking about before.
[17:15:02] <skinux> What's the most used way to create a popup model that displays another page from server?
[17:15:12] <civpro> looks like the #divResponse isnt mattering, the whole page is coming back
[17:15:28] <robertmaxrees> civpro right, jquery then filters everything else out.
[17:15:34] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change how your server responds.
[17:16:12] <robertmaxrees> skinux why not just use ajax to pull the relevant info into the modal instead?
[17:17:15] <skinux> Well, actually, I should ask the best way to create a model from a hidden div in the page.
[17:17:34] <robertmaxrees> by using a library.
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> that's generally what i do.
[17:17:44] <skinux> They will be "form pages" so not necessary to retrieve any data from server.
[17:17:55] <skinux> Which library?
[17:18:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm partial to http://jquery.iceburg.net/jqModal/, but if you already have jquery ui or bootstrap in your project those have good options as well.
[17:24:35] <stevenxl> crap I broke Bootstrap's ScrollSpy plugin.
[17:27:30] <stevenxl> ah - I see exactly what happened
[17:30:07] <skinux> Well, my project template (came with framework) does use Bootstrap, but I have pretty much 0 knowledge of any Bootstrap classes or js functions.
[17:30:28] <stevenxl> Yea, that's my problem as well. ;)
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals skinux
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> their docs are pretty decent.
[17:43:07] <skinux> Okay
[17:43:47] <stevenxl> robertmaxrees, yea their docs are good.
[17:44:03] <stevenxl> I fixed my problem anyways. It was a syntax error.
[17:44:10] <stevenxl> OK, time to leave this cafe. Getting the stink eye.
[17:45:04] <civpro> what is VM558:1 on the error?
[17:45:22] <civpro> it keeps incremented, when i open it up it just says "object object"
[17:45:35] <civpro> does that mean anything to anyone?
[17:54:27] <robertmaxrees> civpro context?
[17:56:07] <skinux> So, Bootstrap modals use element attributes to launch the modals instead of JS function calls?
[18:01:11] <robertmaxrees> skinux you can use function calls, too.
[18:01:44] <robertmaxrees> skinux http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#via-javascript
[18:01:49] <skinux> I don't mind using attributes if it's just as easy and makes cleaner markup
[18:01:55] <skinux> I'm already reading that page.
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> that link shows you how to do it via js.
[18:02:13] <robertmaxrees> takes you straight to the relevant section.
[18:03:13] <skinux> Actually I will need to get some info from server for Edit modal because retrieving the data from within the current page will probably be way more trouble than it's worth.
[18:04:06] <skinux> I'm trying to create a log application.
[18:05:47] <skinux> I haven't come up with a way to edit an entry's data in-place without a bunch of complex code that I'm not sure I could write. So, I need to either copy data around within JS or retrieve from server based on data retrieved from current page.
[18:07:40] <robertmaxrees> "copy data around within js" impliex either ajax or data already on the page.
[18:07:53] <skinux> That's with data already on the page.
[18:08:32] <robertmaxrees> right.  if you're trying to do some kind of "edit" dialogue, then use a modal and send data via ajax to your server.
[18:09:04] <skinux> Yeah, that's why I want an Edit dialogue, because the other way seems like it would be too complicated and possibly simply stupid.
[18:09:13] <robertmaxrees> errr, what other way?
[18:09:29] <skinux> Trying to edit and save data already in the page.
[18:09:59] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, too.  but if you need that info to be persistent at all, you'll need to either use a form post/get or ajax.
[18:11:29] <skinux> I'm trying to use CSS for all layout, not using HTML tables at all. So switching between a form or set of forms would be pretty complicated.
[18:11:42] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:11:49] <robertmaxrees> tables and forms are two different things.
[18:11:51] <skinux> I mean switching between form(s) and straight divs
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> there'd be nothing to switch
[18:12:12] <robertmaxrees> you'd add a form element around the things you're messing with and then use inputs with names.
[18:12:50] <skinux> How would I specify IDs of each entry? ID and CLASS attributes are used by CSS
[18:13:03] <robertmaxrees> you can reuse those classes or add new ones.
[18:13:18] <skinux> I don't want to screw around with hyphenating IDs to include numbers
[18:13:25] <robertmaxrees> you should never do that anyway.
[18:13:31] <robertmaxrees> but if you're using a plain form, ids and classes are irrelevant - names and values are relevant.
[18:13:49] <robertmaxrees> you also have data attributes to store arbitrary data on elements.
[18:14:34] <skinux> I mean, I would need to associate each entry with it's entry ID in the DB.
[18:14:51] <robertmaxrees> you'd do that via your backend and the name attribute on the element.
[18:14:57] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you'll have to do that regardless.
[18:15:07] <robertmaxrees> no matter how you handle your edit/update operation.
[18:15:13] <skinux> Oh, so it's bad practice to try to embed ID into the page at all?
[18:15:25] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're overcomplicating something.
[18:15:41] <robertmaxrees> you have to include some kind of reference back to the DB entry on the input.
[18:15:44] <skinux> Well, thing is, what if there is more than one entry with the same name, so those two entries could get confused when storing in the DB.
[18:15:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, there's no way to tie the two together.
[18:16:03] <robertmaxrees> the input name can be whatever you want it to be.
[18:16:12] <robertmaxrees> it could be the DB ID or some other field.
[18:16:29] <robertmaxrees> think of "name" kind of like a property on an object.
[18:16:37] <skinux> So each input element per entry would have the ID as part of it's name?
[18:18:05] <robertmaxrees> sure, or as the whole name, or some other identifier.
[18:18:23] <robertmaxrees> how else were you planning on tying them back together?
[18:18:26] <skinux> I'm guessing IDs would also need generated client-side?
[18:18:34] <robertmaxrees> uh... huh?
[18:18:44] <robertmaxrees> you're editing things - the ID would be from the DB.
[18:18:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm really lost about your thought process.
[18:19:16] <skinux> Yeah, that question was about adding new, or would the API return the new entries ID to browser?
[18:19:49] <robertmaxrees> if you're adding new items, then you submit that via a POST and then return the ID if you want to pop that into the page for later editing.
[18:20:45] <skinux> <input type="text" name="title_1234" /> I suppose would be how input elements for all Titles would look?
[18:20:58] <robertmaxrees> sure, or just name="1234"
[18:21:08] <robertmaxrees> or however you want to handle that.
[18:21:15] <robertmaxrees> i don't know your DB schema or anything like that.
[18:21:25] <skinux> If it were just name="1234" how would any scripting know that field is the Title for that entry?
[18:21:51] <robertmaxrees> really depends.
[18:21:58] <robertmaxrees> like i said, i have no idea what your DB looks like.
[18:22:01] <robertmaxrees> or your backend.
[18:22:14] <skinux> API isn't really built yet.
[18:22:23] <skinux> The database is.
[18:22:23] <robertmaxrees> then define that.
[18:23:13] <skinux> I'm trying to figure out how presentation should be implemented so that I know how to write the PHP/JS API to work with the data.
[18:25:46] <skinux> Db schema is simple. A table for all entries, each piece of data is a column in the table.
[18:26:18] <skinux> I don't like using one column for multiple pieces of data.
[18:26:37] <robertmaxrees> common sense ;)
[18:26:42] <robertmaxrees> and you have some kind of unique ID for each entry - sometimes that's a GUID or something else.
[18:26:51] <skinux> Yes, each entry has it's own ID in the DB.
[18:26:54] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:27:23] <skinux> That is the ID I've been concerned about, which I know I cannot just use the ID attribute for.
[18:27:37] <robertmaxrees> so now you have a dialog - could be a form that has a hidden input whose name is "uniqueId" or something like that - that's how you tie that form back to a given row.
[18:29:46] <skinux> Yeah, that would work. I've just been unsure about associating the fields of each row with that row's ID.
[18:30:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that
[18:30:55] <skinux> How else would I update that specific row of data with new info or remove it if the entry is deleted?
[18:32:11] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:32:33] <robertmaxrees> you have to send it back to the server, so you have to do a normal form interaction or use ajax.
[18:33:09] <skinux> I mean update the info on the page.  AJAX updates the DB, but then I need to update the data shown on the page after the edit or add modal has disappeared.
[18:33:54] <robertmaxrees> if you're using ajax, you could return whatever the updated data is and then find that entry on the page and update that row.
[18:34:52] <skinux> Yes...but how do I find that row on the page without all fields of that row being associated with ID? If there is more than one entry with the same name then I wouldn't even know that way.
[18:35:20] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have to have that id on each row in that case.
[18:35:57] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll have to get a really awkward with how you find that data.
[18:39:07] <skinux> That's what I'm talking about.
[18:39:20] <skinux> All the fields of each row have to be associated with the entries ID, which I don't know how to do unless I include it in the name of each field's name
[18:39:20] <robertmaxrees> okay
[18:39:29] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the confusion is, then.
[18:40:15] <skinux> Is that what I should do? Make the ID part of each field's name attribute?
[18:48:03] <robertmaxrees> now you're convoluting.
[18:48:03] <robertmaxrees> you have two different things going on.
[18:48:37] <robertmaxrees> you have a place where you're displaying data and a place where you're editing data.
[18:49:03] <robertmaxrees> both will need to use a unique ID - the place you're displaying could use that ID on the parent element for that row.
[18:49:04] <skinux> Yes, editing takes place in a modal
[18:50:53] <skinux> Then I'll have to use the ID attribute to specify that id instead of using it for styling.
[18:51:10] <robertmaxrees> right.  on the display side, you'd normally stick the ID on the parent element for that row.
[18:51:10] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:51:14] <robertmaxrees> you weren't repeating IDs, were you?
[18:51:37] <robertmaxrees> because you could use it for both i support.
[18:51:37] <robertmaxrees> those normally you'd use a class for that.
[18:53:16] <skinux> Oh...duh! ID attribute wouldn't be used for styling the rows anyway because IDs are singular
[18:53:17] <robertmaxrees> *for both i suppose
[18:53:29] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[18:53:31] <robertmaxrees> so there shouldn't be an issue there.

[19:55:27] <alex2401> [Github] WhitestormJS 3d engine based on three.js and cannon.js  I will be glad if you will write about this repository: https://github.com/sasha240100/WhitestormJS  What do you think about this idea?
[19:56:04] <robertmaxrees> alex2401 not really the right place for that.
[21:12:56] <bostonmacosx> hi there
[21:13:09] <bostonmacosx> I have "/*$(document).ajaxStart(function(){    $("#overlay").show();  });  $(document).ajaxComplete(function(){    $("#overlay").hide();  }); */"
[21:13:45] <bostonmacosx> at the beginning of my main JS file but it seems to be interfering with a .html update to a div after an AJAX call
[21:13:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[21:14:02] <robertmaxrees> interfering how?
[21:14:23] <bostonmacosx> Well the DIV won't update when the ajax start and complete are in play.
[21:14:37] <robertmaxrees> the overlay?
[21:14:39] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[21:14:50] <robertmaxrees> (i have no frame of reference for any of your other code soooo...)
[21:15:14] <bostonmacosx> oh sorry...hold on
[21:18:49] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[21:18:59] <robertmaxrees> do you have a small use case or something?
[21:19:20] <robertmaxrees> also, you generally want to avoid use global ajax handlers like those.
[21:19:50] <bostonmacosx> I do I tihnk I might have found the issue
[21:19:59] <robertmaxrees> and what was it?
[21:20:37] <bostonmacosx> AJAX call --->.done(function with an AJAX call) so the double AJAX call does something
[21:20:46] <bostonmacosx> I'm testing it now
[21:20:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, part of why you don't use global ajax handlers like that.
[21:21:08] <robertmaxrees> also, does that second call rely on the first?
[21:22:37] <bostonmacosx> the first calls a function when done....and in the second function is another AJAX call
[21:22:48] <robertmaxrees> right.  i gathered that part.
[21:23:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering why you're calling the second one in the .done() of the first.
[21:23:02] <bostonmacosx> no data passed between the two
[21:23:23] <robertmaxrees> you know you can have multiple promises for a single .done(), yeah?
[21:23:26] <bostonmacosx> well the first one creates a new item...the second refreshes the item list
[21:23:40] <robertmaxrees> okay so the second DOES require the first to finish first.
[21:23:51] <bostonmacosx> yup
[21:24:11] <robertmaxrees> kay.
[21:24:17] <bostonmacosx> I'm just going to have the first call return the new list data straight up
[21:24:21] <bostonmacosx> and update the DIV
[21:24:36] <robertmaxrees> err, you can't return out of an ajax call like that.
[21:25:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm logging for the night. enjoy.
[21:25:39] <bostonmacosx> .done(function(data){updatediv})
[21:25:53] <bostonmacosx> night
[21:57:01] <Mark___> http://imgur.com/o4vlppV does anyone have an idea how i can make this kind of navigation system using js plugin? what plugin or what code should i use to make it 3 horizontal pages with scroll function for each?
[22:31:33] <printForever> I have a page that loads elements via ajax. I would like to run jQuery code after all ajax elements are created/updated/changed.
[22:31:58] <printForever> How can I monitor the page via jQuery, so I would know when the ajax job is completed?
[22:54:13] <Mark___> what do i have to do to make this page scrollable? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/project#firstPage
[23:11:42] <jasonMomoa> is there a way to get part of the text from a tag? (h1, span, p...)
[23:12:05] <jasonMomoa> maybe with .slice?
[23:33:44] <shibly> What's the latest version of jquery?
[23:34:29] <jasonMomoa> Google says its 1.11.3 and 2.1.4
[23:35:19] <jasonMomoa> https://jquery.com/download/
[23:41:29] <shibly> Which one to download 1.11.3 or 2.1.4 ?
[23:42:42] <jasonMomoa> 1.11.3 is the safest bet
[23:44:13] <jalnt> fucking ie is always the thing that holds everything back
[23:44:33] <jasonMomoa> not IE, Microsoft
[23:44:41] <jalnt> yes
[23:46:20] <shibly> Why not 2.1.4?
[23:46:31] <jalnt> I hope edge doesn't become popular
[23:46:45] <jasonMomoa> depends on how much Windows 10 becomes popular
[23:47:08] <jalnt> I don't wanna have to deal with corporate clients in 10 years who are running some old version of edge
[23:47:17] <jalnt> I suppose
[23:47:18] <jasonMomoa> shibly, why not 2.1.4?
[23:47:33] <jasonMomoa> corporate will move where the money is
[23:47:37] <jasonMomoa> if the money is in MS
[23:47:40] <jasonMomoa> that's what they will do
[23:47:48] <jalnt> shibly: because jquery 2.x.x doesn't support ie8 and down
[23:48:22] <jasonMomoa> jalnt, can I do var for each?
[23:48:26] <jalnt> if you don't care about supporting IE then go for v2.x.x
[23:48:50] <jalnt> jasonMomoa: huh?
[23:48:58] <jasonMomoa> :) I'm working on something
[23:49:06] <jasonMomoa> I have a bootstrap layout
[23:49:11] <jasonMomoa> and rows and columns and divs
[23:49:15] <jasonMomoa> row > col > div
[23:49:25] <jasonMomoa> and in div I have some text I wish to substring
[23:49:33] <jasonMomoa> I can do it for 1
[23:49:37] <jasonMomoa> but, how to do it for all?
[23:49:45] <jasonMomoa> I'm guessing I should use for each
[23:50:10] <jalnt> what do you mean by you want to substring the text?
[23:50:31] <jasonMomoa> its a huge table, masked as div's
[23:50:35] <jasonMomoa> with Bootstrap
[23:50:43] <jasonMomoa> and I have to go through the table and edit the "cells"
[23:50:45] <jalnt> are you generating the html with javascript?
[23:50:46] <jasonMomoa> cut them short
[23:50:49] <jasonMomoa> no
[23:50:56] <jasonMomoa> it's already generated
[23:51:30] <jalnt> I'm a bit out of practice with jquery
[23:51:40] <jalnt> I've been working with angular for the last few months
[23:52:04] <jalnt> It sounds like you want to chop the text in each cell to a certain amount of characters
[23:52:06] <jalnt> am I right
[23:53:38] <jasonMomoa> yes
[23:55:28] <jalnt> so if for example, you want to change the text in each div to a different string, I think you can do $(".parent-container").children().each().html("new string")
[23:55:50] <jasonMomoa> right on!
[23:56:24] <jalnt> that's if each div is only one level down from the parent
[23:56:38] <jasonMomoa> I can find the selector easily
[23:56:44] <jasonMomoa> I just didn't know how to use each
[23:56:46] <jasonMomoa> and .html
[23:56:55] <jalnt> ah
[23:57:04] <jalnt> well I'm pretty sure that'll work
[23:57:09] <jalnt> I might be wrong
[23:57:34] <jasonMomoa> can I do? var bingo = $(".main .select2-chosen").text().html(str.substring(2,12));
[23:58:36] <jasonMomoa> nope
[23:58:46] <jasonMomoa> how do I get substring from .text()
[23:58:52] <jasonMomoa> I can't find a way
[23:59:04] <jalnt> oh
[23:59:15] <jalnt> you use either html() or text()
[23:59:27] <jasonMomoa> I need/want text()
[23:59:34] <jalnt> so use that intead
[23:59:43] <jasonMomoa> but just a substring between 10th and 15th character
