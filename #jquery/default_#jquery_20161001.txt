[00:07:39] <theskillwithin> apparen'ty owl carousel breaks with jquery
[00:07:55] <taplar> 3
[00:08:06] <theskillwithin> http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/
[00:08:18] <taplar> as mentioned in the responses, 3.0 removed that andSelf method
[00:08:41] <taplar> aaaaaand another site plug
[00:08:43] <theskillwithin> taplar I don't want to directly edit my vendor js files
[00:08:49] <taplar> you don't have to
[00:09:18] <taplar> either use a version previous to 3.0 or you can most likely fix it by assigning the new method back on the andSelf method
[00:09:36] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/package.json
[00:09:53] <theskillwithin> "uglifyVendorJs": "mkdir -p dist/assets/js && uglifyjs node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js node_modules/owl.carousel/dist/owl.carousel.js --screw-ie8 -m -c -o dist/assets/js/vendor.js"
[00:10:17] <taplar> not sure what your trying to say, :|
[00:10:37] <theskillwithin> well see my vendor assets are npm modules
[00:10:40] <taplar> "jquery": "^3.1.1",
[00:10:54] <theskillwithin> so when I make my vendorjs its just copying that into my dist folder
[00:11:11] <theskillwithin> so I would hesitate to edit that file directly
[00:11:20] <theskillwithin> cuz thats kind of the point of it being vendor
[00:11:22] <theskillwithin> ya know?
[00:11:37] <taplar> again, either switch back to a version prior to three until they fix it or do a polyfill for the method
[00:12:09] <theskillwithin> ya
[00:12:16] <theskillwithin> polyfill for the method?
[00:12:25] <taplar> ya, something like
[00:12:58] <taplar> if ( !jQuery.fn.andSelf ) { jQuery.fn.andSelf = jQuery.fn.addBack; }
[00:13:53] <theskillwithin> hm
[00:14:00] <theskillwithin> where would I run that?
[00:14:15] <theskillwithin> maybe concat that on top of my entire vendorjs? or add into my app js?
[00:14:43] <theskillwithin> which might be possible given the error doesn't occur unless I invoke owl carousel in my main app js
[00:14:44] <taplar> probably just some point before initializing the carousels
[00:15:54] <theskillwithin> omg
[00:15:57] <theskillwithin> taplar that worked!
[00:16:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/d2b966Lq/ yup
[00:16:43] <theskillwithin> I am really good at frontend but still wanna do better with my js ninja skills
[00:17:02] <taplar> according to the docs, as of version 1.8 andSelf was just a wrapper for addBack, so that's a pretty safe pollyfil imho
[00:17:32] <theskillwithin> I think that guy isn't really going to end up doing that killingitwithjquery course he is so busy at google, do you have any cool resources I can look at?
[00:17:51] <taplar> learn.jquery.com try.jquery.com
[00:18:14] <taplar> and hang out in here and observe everyone asking and answering questions.  really helped me expand my toolbox
[00:18:32] <theskillwithin> taplar  https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/src/assets/js/functions.js   can't thank you enough I would have NEVER thought to do that
[00:19:04] <theskillwithin> ya used to skip over this chan cuz it used to be dead but you know a lot
[00:19:19] <taplar> lots of others know more than me, ;)
[00:19:35] <taplar> just have to ask.  they can be shy
[00:19:53] <theskillwithin> im looking for more advanced stuff perhaps
[00:23:02] <theskillwithin> I wan't to make sure my js is organized
[00:24:23] <theskillwithin> How a pro approaches it
[00:25:25] <theskillwithin> and your insight you shared seems to be familiarity with jquery itself?
[00:26:06] <taplar> i'm trying to stay up on the jquery scene.  done some vanilla js too, but i'm not as strong with it
[00:26:36] <taplar> i know enough to be dangerous, :D
[00:29:02] <taplar> but yeah, that solution was a familiarity of the jQuery.fn object and then just checking the api
[00:29:09] <theskillwithin> I feel like I was always getting these tips on how to do something in just js and it was easier than you thought
[00:29:53] <theskillwithin> taplar  https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/src/assets/js/functions.js  anything you would change about this code here?
[00:30:00] <taplar> *shrug* hey, if you can do it the hard way, then learn the less typing way, there's something to be said about knowing how to do the hard way
[00:30:55] <taplar> $('section#trendingProjects .owl-carousel') <-- i'd recommend changing this to $('#trendingProjects').find('.owl-carousel')
[00:30:58] <theskillwithin> taplar  maybe I should cache stuff like     var headerNavUl =  $('header nav ul');
[00:31:21] <theskillwithin> oooo
[00:31:40] <taplar> ids are unique so preceeding it with section doesn't buy you much
[00:32:07] <taplar> plus doing just $('#someid') will let jquery find the element without going through sizzle, which can be slower
[00:32:11] <theskillwithin> ahh ya I just like to do that in my SASS  it just visually able to navigate the code faster
[00:32:39] <taplar> headerNavUl...
[00:33:13] <taplar> you could actually cache header and the nav
[00:33:40] <theskillwithin> var headerNav = $('header nav');    ?
[00:33:54] <taplar> var $header = $('header'), $headerNav = $header.find('nav');
[00:33:57] <theskillwithin> headerNav.addClass(' .....
[00:34:33] <taplar> then depending on which one you need to use, use it, or if you need to find other stuff, like .hamburger, you can use the existing variable to find off of
[00:35:21] <theskillwithin> I do remember hearing find is good to use but dang u use it a lot huh
[00:35:47] <taplar> if there's a common root that i find various children in, yep
[00:36:10] <theskillwithin> taplar but how does $headerNav help me when I want to select ul under that?
[00:36:27] <taplar> $headerNav.find('ul')
[00:36:42] <taplar> you've already found all the navs, no need to do the processing to find them again
[00:38:15] <theskillwithin> taplar hmmm https://i.imgur.com/ZKcrDQQ.png
[00:38:47] <taplar> woah
[00:39:01] <theskillwithin> maybe thats just cuz I didn't configure eslint, not that I would know how to anyways
[00:39:05] <taplar> wth is that?  some sort of minifier or uglifier?
[00:39:21] <taplar> cause that's perfectly valid to do
[00:39:28] <theskillwithin> search for eslint  https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/package.json
[00:39:45] <taplar> ah
[00:40:07] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/.eslintrc.js
[00:40:17] <theskillwithin> oh dang I have this one too https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/.eslintrc.json
[00:40:20] <theskillwithin> hrm
[00:40:53] <theskillwithin> taplar  do you have a recommendation for a js linter?
[00:41:25] <taplar> not really.  we have some minifier as part of my project at work, but I'm not sure what it uses.
[00:41:37] <taplar> as for that error: http://eslint.org/docs/rules/one-var
[00:41:37] <theskillwithin> I have been having all sorts of linter problems lately haha,  my  sass linter in sublime text uses npm sass-lint and that apparently doesn't work with tabs on sass yet
[00:41:49] <taplar> you may have a one-var rule set some where.  not sure
[00:53:31] <taplar> theskillwithin: https://jsfiddle.net/t7svv2f4/
[00:55:45] <taplar> fixing to get out of here and crash, but a couple changes I made in regards to that fiddle snipplet
[00:55:52] <taplar> when you do something like
[00:56:22] <taplar> $(x).find('child1').doSomething();
[00:56:32] <taplar> $(x).find('child2').doSomething();
[00:56:40] <taplar> you can reduce that to be
[00:56:51] <taplar> $(x).find('child1, child2').doSomething();
[00:57:03] <taplar> comma in a selector functions as a logical OR
[00:57:50] <taplar> and towards the bottom you'll see some uses of the add() method
[00:58:21] <taplar> that method is a way to add more elements to your jQuery object result stack, so then you can do the method you want to do to them all, all at one time
[00:58:41] <theskillwithin> oo
[00:58:41] <theskillwithin> nice
[00:58:47] <theskillwithin> thankyou taplar
[00:58:56] <theskillwithin> lots of goodies
[00:59:00] <taplar> sure, just some tools for the toolbox, :)
[00:59:26] <taplar> have a good *insert your time of day*, ^_^
[02:29:09] <theskillwithin> https://github.com/theskillwithin/hrtcup/blob/master/src/assets/js/functions.js  did you have problem earlier with using    return false?  did you want me to use preventDefault?
[02:30:10] <robertmaxrees> talking to somebody specifically?
[02:46:09] <theskillwithin> robertmaxrees I guess to everyone at this point
[05:57:18] <rokshis> Guys, could anyone tell me the meaning of this $('a[href*="#"]').click() { etc }..
[05:57:28] <rokshis> What does href *= do?
[06:00:11] <rokshis> Got the answer. Thanks all.

[08:24:32] <mechanist> https://jsfiddle.net/xwkbxrm3/ I would like the radio button form disappears if 'Static Mesh' is checked and the button 'Go' below is clicked, there's something wrong in my code, but I couldn't figure it out
[09:26:49] <iaj> Hi guys, when I want to have a global variable inside the jQuery(document).ready(function(){ part how do I do it?
[09:27:10] <iaj> I try to use $var='test';   and after page is loaded I try a console.log($var);   but its not declared.
[09:31:39] <r3ply> iaj: I think you have to set it on the window object
[09:52:34] <naftilos76> Hi can you pls have a look at: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/916a690b67479d60aab4a9ca6507ccf7
[09:55:44] <naftilos76> For some strange reason the var attr_name previously evaluated to 'home_page' does not seem to have that value anymore
[09:55:57] <naftilos76> can anybody have a look?
[09:59:06] <mechanist> https://jsfiddle.net/xwkbxrm3/ I would like the radio button form disappears if 'Static Mesh' is checked and the button 'Go' below is clicked, there's something wrong in my code, but I couldn't figure it out
[10:01:33] <naftilos76> it's just you and me...
[11:57:50] <naftilos76> Hi, using removeAttr() to actually remove a 'data-blabla' attribute is successfull but if i do element.data() , the attribute is still there. Is this normal?
[11:59:51] <taplar> naftilos76: looks like your attr_name has quotes
[12:00:00] <taplar> 'home_page'
[12:00:09] <taplar> where as the key is just: home_page
[12:00:36] <naftilos76> taplar, let me have a look
[12:02:15] <taplar> hmm, mechanist left
[12:02:29] <naftilos76> taplar, i solved that problem
[12:02:35] <taplar> k
[12:02:51] <naftilos76> the problem with the removeAttr() remains
[12:03:34] <taplar> oh, because data() caches
[12:03:40] <naftilos76> the attribute is phisicly removed but i can still get the value of the attribute if i do element.data()
[12:03:49] <naftilos76> so it is normal?
[12:03:53] <taplar> do data( 'your thing', '' ) to remove it
[12:03:54] <taplar> yes
[12:04:12] <taplar> jQuery doesn't go to the variable every time.  it will once, i think, and after that they are cached
[12:04:16] <naftilos76> i have done that but that is not a solution, anyway thanks
[12:04:55] <taplar> in any case, if your mixing the use of data() along with actually chaning the attributes on the element, your going to run into issue.  you need to stick with one or the other
[12:09:01] <taplar> mmm to switch to the laptop and fiddle with code while watching netfix.... or play emulator.... decisions decisions...
[12:09:53] <taplar> emulator it is
[13:15:23] <yeghmorassen> help
[15:08:46] <NTrash> Can anyone help with this? https://jsfiddle.net/2wx6826e/
[15:20:27] <sillyslux> NTrash, https://jsfiddle.net/2wx6826e/1/ because Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[15:22:25] <NTrash> In my actual website it is defined so that's not the problem
[15:23:47] <sillyslux> hmm, then, what is?
[15:29:07] <NTrash> just need to know why the animation isn't working
[15:29:47] <sillyslux> is it working in https://jsfiddle.net/2wx6826e/1/ ?
[15:32:13] <NTrash> yes my original code is working in jsfiddle, but no in my website. hmm, thanks anyway
[15:32:31] <sillyslux> say what?!
[15:33:24] <sillyslux> anyway.. you didn't see the error in the fiddle you had, did you look for errors in you website?
[15:34:25] <sillyslux> 2nd how sure are you there actually is an element $('#xy') in the dom present when .animate is executed?
[15:34:38] <NTrash> i included the animation within document.ready and now it works
[15:34:49] <NTrash> ;)
[15:34:57] <sillyslux> hah, so 2nd it was..
[17:56:07] <momomo> since when doesn't form.submit() catch submission on keyboard enter?
[17:56:55] <momomo> do you need a submit button ?
[18:04:17] <momomo> my mistake
[18:12:40] <jonez> momomo, what was the fix?
[18:23:11] <momomo> i want
[18:23:22] <momomo> i wasn't binding on the form .. was in a totally differnt form :S
[18:23:31] <momomo> event.preventDefault() is enough
[18:40:30] <theskillwithin> http://devtipsshow.com/killingitwithjquery/ if your interested in this sign up, I have been waiting for him to make this series for a long time.
[22:58:14] <TWG_> I really like how I can use @import in SCSS.  Is there anything like that I can use in jquery?
