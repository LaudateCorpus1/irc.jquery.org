[01:32:15] <ceramicskull> Hey guys, I'm looking to start storing JSON data on my server. Now I wanted to know what is everyone's preferred DB choice. I've read that if you have consistent JSON arrays/objects, mysql should be fine. But I've also read that MongoDB is perfect for storing JSON data.
[02:45:04] <dopie> Hey all
[02:46:08] <dopie> I have a question why aren't my global scoped variables getting used?
[02:46:09] <dopie> https://jsfiddle.net/g7c6pzd4/1/
[02:46:23] <dopie> in addInitials
[02:46:33] <nru> is it possible with jquery to catch POST data from a child window
[02:52:16] <hellyeah> do you know jqxcalendar http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/3/
[02:52:25] <hellyeah> how can i convert english text into turkish?
[03:15:02] <hellyeah> heyu anyone around?
[03:16:24] <hellyeah> hmm when you click submit button you will see val of input boxes seperately but what i need is the date value between those two dats how can i get that? http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/4/
[03:27:40] <hellyeah> anyone aroound?
[05:35:29] <admin__> hi all, I need help with Jquery's autocomplete and results from a mysql db. My code works when 'source' is an array of srtings, but fails when I call myrequest.php. Any pointers please?
[05:46:20] <lonequid> If I'm going to have this same code setup for multiple form inputs, is there a way to combine the code? I'm thinking something along the lines of switching the selector to something generic and using parent/child: https://jsfiddle.net/28yvzdwy/
[06:04:30] <WilsonG> https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/5/ How can i prevent chopy move in this situation? If i remove condition for the hasClass offset can calcualte from from blue element if cursor is moved on it
[06:15:43] <PuruPuru> hello. I want to clone an element and change it depending on situation. I stored the object in a var but I'm not sure how to access the var attributes.
[06:20:42] <PuruPuru> nevermind, I need to use .find()
[06:43:42] <hellyeah> hey anyone around
[06:44:12] <hellyeah> what is my mistake here i cannot get datepicker when i click input box http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/9/
[06:46:07] <slax0r> because the input does not exist when you are calling .datepicker()
[06:46:19] <hellyeah> oh damn
[06:47:12] <hellyeah> it should work now? http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/11/
[06:47:26] <slax0r> no
[06:47:39] <slax0r> $(function() {}); is the same as $(document).ready(function() {});
[06:47:46] <slax0r> and doesn't matter where in code it is
[06:47:56] <slax0r> you just need to call .datepicker() after you have appended the element to the dom
[06:48:02] <slax0r> hint: in your addSome function
[06:48:41] <hellyeah> i called after addSome
[06:48:58] <slax0r> no, you didn't
[06:49:05] <hellyeah> here http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/12/
[06:49:20] <slax0r> no -.-
[06:49:35] <slax0r> the element is not created until you click on the button
[06:49:42] <slax0r> .datepicker is executed when the browser loads that line
[06:49:49] <slax0r> now put that as the last line of your addSome function
[06:51:34] <hellyeah> yeah you are right sorry for stupid question :o
[06:52:10] <slax0r> I would suggest you learn about code-flow in jquery, because I have a feeling you don't understand it completely
[06:52:37] <hellyeah> anything you can suggest ?
[06:53:43] <hellyeah> slax0r: one more question why second input box didnt work as datepicker http://jsfiddle.net/xgmmffm5/14/
[06:54:52] <slax0r> don't know, too advanced frontend stuff for me, but afaik it should work, maybe a limitation of datepicker?
[06:55:16] <hellyeah> actually when you said datapickerclss.datepicker
[06:55:20] <hellyeah> it should both work
[06:55:29] <hellyeah> hmm there is no error in copnsole also
[06:55:38] <slax0r> as for flow/life cycle, google
[06:56:01] <slax0r> that's jq ui?
[06:56:22] <hellyeah> jquery ui yes
[06:57:55] <slax0r> maybe with each? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/707603/apply-jquery-datepicker-to-multiple-instances
[06:57:58] <slax0r> I don't know
[06:58:00] <slax0r> I never really used jq ui
[06:58:16] <hellyeah> okey thats fine thank you
[07:53:30] <hellyeah> hey can i ask about jqx calendar here?
[08:19:46] <wa5ted> hellyeah: check topic
[08:20:41] <hellyeah> :XD
[08:20:46] <CMz> Hello
[08:20:56] <CMz> I'm trying to get my model data to feed into this: var date1 = $.datepicker.parseDate($.datepicker._defaults.dateFormat, $("#input1").val());
[08:20:57] <hellyeah> not contain jqx
[08:21:09] <CMz> How would I send ASP.NET model info into the #input1?
[08:25:39] <jbc8> is it possible to generate an error in the Javascript Console so that it gets caught by window.onerror = function(){} ?
[08:34:17] <jbc8> i found the answer: window.setTimeout(function() {throw new Error()}, 0);
[08:34:27] <jbc8> throw new Error() doesn't do it
[08:45:12] <sigdk> hello, is there a relationship between row and nTr in this example: https://jsfiddle.net/wn8kudjt/
[08:45:19] <sigdk> can I go from one to the other ?
[08:50:50] <yottabyte> hey y'all, if I have an ajax call that returns json, this code is iterating over it by $.each(json, function(i, element {, but i is never used. it just does stuff with the elements. what is i there for?
[08:51:24] <yottabyte> oh, just the index, whether you use it or not, you need it?
[08:51:32] <yottabyte> like 1, element1, 2, element2, etc
[09:13:22] <PuruPuru> can anyone help me fix this... it just keeps adding buttons with button-close id every time i call the click function from elements that have data-id-comments http://pastebin.com/DeKJ68Wn
[09:14:41] <taplar> $('#active-comment').show()
[09:14:46] <taplar> that's not checking if it exists
[09:14:53] <taplar> $('#active-comment').length would
[09:15:51] <taplar> $(this).attr('data-id-comments')
[09:15:57] <taplar> use data('id-comments')
[09:17:05] <taplar> / form2 should exist just in .click() function scope right????
[09:17:10] <taplar> technically no
[09:17:26] <taplar> the variable form2 will only exist in the click scope, but your assigning it as a global variable
[09:17:41] <taplar> so any changes to that form will affect the locallized form2's
[09:18:21] <taplar> button.attr('id','button-close');
[09:18:31] <taplar> how many of these are you doing?  id's must be unique
[09:18:42] <taplar> *for the entire page
[09:19:50] <taplar> so that's a start, :)
[09:24:07] <taplar> also: $('[data-id-comments]')
[09:24:26] <taplar> if there is any way that you could scope that down, it would be better.  that is going to be performing a complete dom scan
[09:52:02] <cannap> o_O
[09:52:28] <taplar> wut
[09:53:13] <hellyeah> hey anyone around
[09:53:33] <taplar> few peeps are
[09:53:47] <hellyeah> this is my example http://jsfiddle.net/zq2gubmf/2/ this is the error  Font from origin 'http://code.cdn.mozilla.net' has been blocked from loading by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://jsfiddle.net' is therefore not allowed access. do you have any idea a
[09:53:47] <hellyeah> bout how to fix?
[09:55:43] <hellyeah> it is official address i added in external source
[09:56:02] <taplar> i don't see that  in the fiddle.
[09:56:35] <hellyeah> you dont see what?
[09:56:47] <taplar> that error or the font trying to load from that address
[09:56:47] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/zq2gubmf/3/
[09:57:16] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[09:57:21] <taplar> still no
[09:57:23] <hellyeah> i got this error everytime
[09:58:50] <hellyeah> taplar: dialog is working on your side?
[09:59:21] <taplar> it looks like jsfiddle is doing something with fonts from http://code.cdn.mozilla.net
[09:59:33] <taplar> in which case you can't fix that
[09:59:37] <taplar> that's all them.
[09:59:45] <hellyeah> ic
[09:59:45] <taplar> you might mention it in #jsfiddle
[09:59:57] <hellyeah> ic
[10:00:05] <hellyeah> my dialog didnt work it is weird
[10:00:22] <taplar> what dialog?
[10:00:56] <hellyeah> li,ne 12
[10:01:01] <hellyeah> when you click sms button
[10:01:39] <hellyeah> damn,
[10:01:54] <taplar> why would it do a dialog?
[10:01:57] <hellyeah> it is 5p.m.
[10:02:06] <hellyeah> i started to work 9 p.m.
[10:02:19] <hellyeah> i guess i cannot focus on in the later day
[10:02:21] <hellyeah> i forgot to call function
[10:03:04] <hellyeah> works now http://jsfiddle.net/xsr03y5s/3/
[10:03:34] <hellyeah> but dialog box is weird
[10:03:47] <hellyeah> when you close it and open it second time by clicking sms button
[10:03:53] <hellyeah> something happened weirdly
[10:06:48] <hellyeah> any idea?
[10:08:12] <taplar> $('body').click(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); event.stopPropagation(); })
[10:08:13] <taplar> huh?
[10:08:26] <hellyeah> what
[10:08:39] <taplar> what is that trying to do
[10:08:42] <hellyeah> sorry
[10:08:48] <hellyeah> i fogrot commented out
[10:08:56] <hellyeah> i dont need that since i have a layer
[10:09:01] <taplar> and this is doing a binding every time you click the outer click: $('.ui-button').on('click', function () {
[10:09:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:09:38] <hellyeah> i suppose it will hide insidebody when you click close button
[10:09:45] <hellyeah> isnt that correct?
[10:10:29] <taplar> not sure at this point.  got multiple things going it.  i just know it's going to bind multiple times
[10:10:57] <hellyeah> i have to hide insidebody
[10:11:59] <hellyeah> is there any other alternative you can suggest?
[10:12:33] <hellyeah> ops
[10:12:38] <hellyeah> there is close callback
[10:12:58] <taplar> there is dialog('open') dialog('close') to open and close
[10:13:04] <taplar> you only want to initialize once
[10:14:01] <hellyeah> or close: function( event, ui ) {}
[10:14:12] <taplar> no, that's the callback
[10:14:41] <taplar> when you do dialog('close') or click the X on the dialog that results in the dialog closing, that callback will be invoked afterwards
[10:14:47] <hellyeah> anything wrong with callback i dont understand
[10:15:10] <taplar> i just explained what that does
[10:15:42] <taplar> the docs also explain that
[10:16:14] <hellyeah> yes sorry foır that i am tired
[10:16:22] <hellyeah> they want so many things
[10:16:24] <taplar> then take a break dude
[10:16:31] <hellyeah> i challenged three different things today
[10:19:59] <WilsonG> https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/5/ how can i prevent that choppy moving? if i remove if condidtion, element is blinking, because offset calculates from the blue box if cursor moves behind it
[10:20:19] <hellyeah> i dont understand why this weird thing happening
[10:21:37] <taplar> WilsonG: for one thing your doing dom lookups inside event handlers for mouse movements.  that's going to slow it down
[10:22:47] <hellyeah> okey
[10:22:52] <hellyeah> i found what happened
[10:23:02] <hellyeah> overlay will mess up dialog box
[10:23:14] <hellyeah> yes
[10:23:18] <taplar> WilsonG: your also binding the mousemove event on every mouse enter
[10:24:40] <WilsonG> taplar: Then how do i suppose to track it>?
[10:24:58] <hellyeah> br
[10:24:59] <hellyeah> b
[10:25:19] <taplar> WilsonG: https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/6/  still has the issue, but it's not doing so many lookups and only binding once
[10:26:24] <taplar> ok
[10:26:36] <taplar> and the choppy movement is due to your class checking
[10:26:43] <WilsonG> yea i know
[10:26:45] <taplar> so long as your mouse movement is over the blue box it's not going to move
[10:26:54] <WilsonG> because if i remove it
[10:27:04] <WilsonG> then offset calculates from the blue box
[10:27:08] <WilsonG> and it starts blinking
[10:29:40] <taplar> so this isn't desired? https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/7/
[10:30:31] <taplar> ah, cause the box follows you outside the red box
[10:30:31] <WilsonG> well, it should be wrapped inside the red element
[10:47:01] <taplar> WilsonG: ok, what about this https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/8/
[10:49:22] <WilsonG> hmm is close enought now, i sholud only make a boundaries now, so the blue box shouldnt go outside red box
[10:49:29] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/9/ if you moved the mouse fast it would leave the red box and break.  attached the mousemove to the parent too
[10:50:33] <WilsonG> But its nice, thanks taplar :)
[10:56:56] <taplar> WilsonG: https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/10/ it's taking some margins or something into account, but it's a start, :)
[10:58:02] <taplar> though the hide is broken
[10:58:11] <taplar> hah, cause it can't go beyond now
[10:59:33] <WilsonG> i thought what about binding hide on mouse leave?
[10:59:56] <WilsonG> from parent
[11:00:09] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with a weird issue I'm having.  When I run this code, https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/wn94bzux/, on my local machine it returns an array of 2 since there are only two data files that currently exist.  When I move this to my staging server, it returns 12 items in the array.  Same data files.  The other 10 have HTML written to thei
[11:00:09] <_TWG_> r data field.
[11:00:24] <WilsonG> ok i have to leave
[11:00:26] <WilsonG> cya
[11:01:06] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/xypzo7pb/11/ sweet
[11:01:45] <_TWG_> very nice
[11:02:26] <_TWG_> I see there is a hard restrirct on right and bottom.  Is it suppose to be on the left and top as well taplar?
[11:02:49] <taplar> yeah, it breaks out there.  there's still some issues, :)
[11:03:22] <_TWG_> okay.  was just curious
[11:11:57] <v0lksman> hello all!  I have a weird problem. I have a chunk of HTML being returned to an ajax post call.  I want to search through that html and see if a class is present so something like if ( $('.success', data).length ) {}  but it doesn't ever match even when I know the class is present...am I missing something here?
[11:12:52] <taplar> so your success method is something like function(data){ //blahh } ?
[11:13:03] <v0lksman> taplar: yes exactly
[11:13:17] <taplar> and data is a string of html
[11:13:36] <v0lksman> yes, and I dump that to console to verify as well
[11:13:55] <taplar> ok, so you should be able to do $(data).find('.myclass').length
[11:15:31] <v0lksman> same...I get a zero value on length each time
[11:15:58] <taplar> got a fiddle?  can you should me the html being returned and the lookup your trying?
[11:17:54] <v0lksman> not a fiddle but here's the code:  https://dpaste.de/8Ggy
[11:18:29] <v0lksman> please ignore the parent().parent().parent() thing...I plan to clean that up... :)
[11:18:42] <taplar> and what does the html returned look like?
[11:18:51] <taplar> oh, sorry
[11:18:56] <v0lksman> line 21 on is the dump of the html
[11:19:32] <taplar> ok, so i'm thinking it's because it's a top level element
[11:19:45] <taplar> so try $(data).filter('.myclass').length
[11:20:20] <EugenA> how can I create a regex to match " and ' ? something like --- var specialChars = new RegExp("\"");
[11:20:39] <v0lksman> that worked!  so what's the difference?
[11:20:47] <taplar> ['"] would be the set
[11:20:56] <taplar> the difference is in the nesting
[11:21:19] <EugenA> taplar: how do I put it in a var?
[11:21:22] <taplar> $('<tag1></tag1><tag2></tag2>') will result in a jquery object containing two elements
[11:21:52] <taplar> so you would have to filter on those to find which one you wanted, as find() looks for child elements of the elements in the result set
[11:22:24] <v0lksman> huh...interesting...TIL
[11:22:26] <v0lksman> thanks!
[11:24:50] <taplar> EugenA: https://jsfiddle.net/7we2rheb/
[11:26:04] <sigdk> is there a relationship between row and nTr in this example: https://jsfiddle.net/wn8kudjt/
[11:26:06] <sigdk> can I go from one to the other ?
[11:26:58] <taplar> i'd think they would be the same thing
[11:27:34] <sigdk> taplar, doesn't look so when I print them
[11:27:46] <taplar> or to rephrase, they should reference the same DOM Element
[11:28:04] <taplar> one is a jQuery object, the other is not
[11:28:27] <sigdk> can I go from one to the other ?
[11:29:02] <taplar> jQuery.get() -> DOM Element(s); $(DOM Element) -> jQuery object
[11:29:04] <EugenA> taplar: thanks!
[11:29:08] <_TWG_> Can anyone help me with a weird issue I'm having.  When I run this code, https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/wn94bzux/, on my local machine it returns an array of 2 since there are only two data files that currently exist.  When I move this to my staging server, it returns 12 items in the array.  Same data files.  The other 10 have HTML written to thei
[11:29:08] <_TWG_> r data field.
[11:29:37] <taplar> _TWG_: i'm getting a 404 when i go to that link
[11:31:09] <_TWG_> taplar try https://jsfiddle.net/maddtechwf/wn94bzux/1/
[11:33:01] <taplar> ok, so what part corresponds to your issue?
[11:34:13] <_TWG_> I think its on line 8 months.forEach(function(month, index){ .  When that runs on my local machine I get a 2 item array.  When it runs on my staging environment (IIS) it give me as 12 item array.  10 of those items have misc html written to the data field.
[11:35:11] <taplar> so 10 of the records are results of something like file not found page results?
[11:36:21] <_TWG_> That is coreect.
[11:36:21] <_TWG_> correct
[11:36:59] <taplar> weird, it shouldn't be calling the done() if it is not a success
[11:37:31] <taplar> unless your site isn't returing it as an actual error
[11:37:53] <taplar> do this, pop open your developer tools and go to the networking tab
[11:38:07] <taplar> and then run your script
[11:38:16] <taplar> you should see the 12 requests pop up in there
[11:38:20] <_TWG_> on my local or staging page?
[11:38:25] <taplar> staging
[11:38:39] <taplar> see what kind of http response code(s) they get
[11:39:02] <_TWG_> 10 xhr getting 304
[11:39:12] <taplar> so a redirect
[11:39:44] <taplar> oh, unmodified, that's fine
[11:39:53] <taplar> hmm
[11:40:10] <_TWG_> Sorry that was wrong.  My two files that I have are getting a 304.  The 10 that aren't there are getting 302 redirect
[11:40:20] <duch_kazatel> same diff.
[11:40:25] <duch_kazatel> 302/304 aren't errors.
[11:41:05] <taplar> so i'm thinking that your going to want to include the xhr response object in your done and check the response code
[11:41:19] <_TWG_> Okay.  How would I do that?
[11:41:26] <duch_kazatel> or fix your server to give you the proper response in the first place.
[11:41:40] <taplar> ^
[11:41:49] <_TWG_> I would love to do that duch_kazatel.  I'm not an IIS guy.  Do you happen to be?
[11:41:52] <duch_kazatel> or fix your current response to include some extra information in the response to signify it's an error.
[11:42:07] <duch_kazatel> and use .done() for everything.
[11:42:24] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't use 302/304 in this case though, since those could later be legitimate responses.
[11:42:28] <_TWG_> I will have to get with my sysadmin to fix the server not returning the right response codes.  How can I do a quick fix right now.
[11:42:58] <taplar> the parameters are like function(data, textStatus, xhr)
[11:43:07] <taplar> so the third parameter
[11:43:25] <taplar> not sure the property off of it yet though
[11:44:34] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR for some reading
[11:45:33] <taplar> probably xhr.statusCode()
[11:48:17] <_TWG_> Looking at the xhr data returned for each item and they are all the same.
[11:48:31] <_TWG_> All return a 200 statusCode
[11:48:40] <taplar> wtf
[11:48:44] <duch_kazatel> because the final response is a 200.
[11:48:57] <taplar> oh, it's doing the redirect before actually returning?
[11:48:57] <duch_kazatel> that's the one that jquery cares about.
[11:49:08] <duch_kazatel> how else would it do the redirect? :)
[11:49:19] <taplar> yeah yeah
[11:49:24] <_TWG_> so I really need to get the response code issue fixed right?
[11:49:29] <taplar> yep
[11:49:38] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ or fix the serverside response to something more appropriate.
[11:49:43] <_TWG_> How would i phrase that to my sysadmin when asking him to fix it?
[11:49:48] <taplar> is typically expected that a not found would be a 404
[11:49:54] <duch_kazatel> ^
[11:50:21] <taplar> "I'm trying to access a file that does not exist.  The server is not returning a 404.  It is redirecting me to some other page"
[11:50:49] <duch_kazatel> what does the response look like?  JSON or something else?
[11:50:57] <_TWG_> Well if I try to access the file directly, I'm getting redirected to my 404 page.
[11:50:58] <duch_kazatel> because there's another approach here.
[11:51:07] <taplar> lol
[11:51:13] <duch_kazatel> _TWG_ but is that 404 page actually returning a 404 error code?
[11:51:20] <taplar> yeah, so it's redirecting to a friendly file not found page
[11:52:17] <_TWG_> That is correct taplar.  The guy before me setup a "pretty" 404 page.
[11:52:33] <duch_kazatel> but it's not really a 404 page.
[11:52:34] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:52:45] <taplar> that's fine.  it should be setup though to still return the 404
[11:52:46] <duch_kazatel> i bet if you look at the response code you'll see it's a 200.
[11:52:57] <duch_kazatel> what is the format of the data getting returned?
[11:53:02] <duch_kazatel> JSON or something else?
[11:53:02] <_TWG_> correct.  Is there a way to make it appear as one.  Can I put any code in the header?
[11:53:15] <taplar> he's trying to get a csv file
[11:53:21] <duch_kazatel> ugh csv.
[11:53:28] <taplar> :)
[11:53:40] <duch_kazatel> then you'll need to figure out what's handling that redirect cycle and change that to be a 404 _TWG_
[11:53:41] <_TWG_> Looking in developer tools it shows to be an Object {}
[11:53:52] <duch_kazatel> there are more than a few ways to handle that.
[11:54:30] <taplar> lol, it would be dirty but.... data.indexOf('<html>') > -1
[11:54:36] <duch_kazatel> nooooo
[11:54:38] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[11:54:44] <taplar> heh
[11:54:48] <taplar> yeah, fix your server
[11:54:53] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^^
[11:58:17] <_TWG_> Fixed it.  Thanks everyone
[11:58:30] <taplar> fast
[11:58:40] <taplar> what was it?
[11:58:44] * taplar is curious
[11:58:49] <_TWG_> I called him and he said I could remove the custom 404 page.
[11:59:08] <_TWG_> So I went into IIS and set it back to the default path.
[11:59:09] <taplar> uh, you don't have to remove it.  that's nice for users who fubar a url
[11:59:36] <taplar> there should be the option to return the page while keeping the response code in tact
[11:59:40] <sigdk> taplar, I extended the previous sample code. https://jsfiddle.net/bpes16r5/18/   Whenever I click a line, I get "nTr.get is not a function"
[11:59:50] <_TWG_> I removed it until I can figure out how to set the code correctly in IIS with a custom page.
[11:59:54] <taplar> sigdk: no, git() is a jQuery function
[11:59:58] <taplar> *get()
[12:00:03] <taplar> you do that off of a jQuery object
[12:00:26] <taplar> nTr, as you had it, was a raw dom Element
[12:01:43] <sigdk> taplar, you mean it should be like this: var foo = $(nTr); ?
[12:01:57] <taplar> that would wrap nTr in a jQuery object
[12:02:26] <taplar> and get() would effectively undo that
[12:02:39] <sigdk> can I get a reference from one to the other ?
[12:02:53] <sigdk> I've an nTr in my code and I need to go back to a row
[12:02:55] <taplar> huh?
[12:03:04] <taplar> nTr is the row, as you had it
[12:03:17] <taplar> a jquery object is just a wrapper around a dom element
[12:03:44] <sigdk> I want to update a row at my datatable (https://datatables.net/reference/api/row().data())
[12:03:56] <sigdk> can I do it with an nTr at hand ?
[12:04:31] <taplar> you can do that one of two ways
[12:04:40] <taplar> you can change the nTr directly
[12:04:49] <taplar> or you can wrap it with $() and then use the data tables functions to modify it
[12:05:13] <taplar> or do the jquery methods to modify it directly
[12:06:28] <taplar> *note that datatables does some caching stuff I believe, so depending on what you change outside of the datatable methods, things may get wacky
[12:07:55] <taplar> _TWG_: you still here?
[12:08:04] <_TWG_> yup
[12:08:08] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2345038/iis-404-custom-error-url-return-response-code-200-instead
[12:09:05] <_TWG_> I actually just read an article similar to that.  I'm going to create new error pages after lunch with the correct response codes so it will be fixed once and for all.
[12:09:14] <taplar> :D
[12:29:52] <jop008> I have a site testing in Chrome when I notice errors I solve them. My test colleague still got errors looking on his console I find the old code there. In Network we have disable cache
[12:30:11] <jop008> how to solve this
[12:30:11] <duch_kazatel> clear cache
[12:30:11] <jop008> We want to have a site for thousands people if they all run in this erros
[12:30:11] <jop008> how to clear cache
[12:30:29] <duch_kazatel> https://www.google.com/search?q=chrome+how+to+clear+cache
[12:30:34] <jop008> We must be > 1000 users proof
[12:31:01] <jop008> and not only in chrome
[12:31:24] <jop008> We can not tell all the people how to clear cahche
[12:31:31] <duch_kazatel> then you need to cachebust your JS file.  look at your server and make sure your headers aren't set to be like 30 days.
[12:31:42] <jop008> it must be fault free wo cache issues
[12:31:46] <duch_kazatel> that's more appropriate for a different channel.
[12:32:03] <jop008> which channel
[12:32:06] <duch_kazatel> try #web or a channel for whatever server/language you're using in your backend.
[12:32:16] <jop008> it is topic related to js decelopmment
[12:32:26] <duch_kazatel> your question isn't specific to jquery.
[12:32:33] <duch_kazatel> and it's likely much more about file caching :)
[12:35:06] <claytonzaugg> is there a real difference between .replaceWith('<my-code>') and .html('<my-code.')?
[12:35:15] <duch_kazatel> yes
[12:35:22] <duch_kazatel> replaceWith replaces the current target element.
[12:35:30] <duch_kazatel> .html() swaps out its contents.
[12:36:16] <claytonzaugg> which is more preferred? If I'm trying to replace a modal dialog box for a campaign, which should I use/
[12:36:30] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to change the parent element or its contents?
[12:36:38] <claytonzaugg> Its contents
[12:36:54] <duch_kazatel> there's your answer then :)_
[12:37:00] <duch_kazatel> .html() swaps out its contents, so that's what you want.
[12:41:11] <claytonzaugg> duch_kazatel, I think I answered your question incorrectly.  I read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/730916/whats-the-difference-between-jquerys-replacewith-and-html
[12:41:27] <duch_kazatel> do you understand the difference between the two?
[12:41:30] <claytonzaugg> I am replacing all of the HTML tags within a fancybox, not just the content
[12:41:34] <claytonzaugg> I do, yes
[12:41:45] <claytonzaugg> I am replacing all the HTML ultimately, not just the content between the elements
[12:41:52] <duch_kazatel> then you want replaceWith
[12:42:00] <claytonzaugg> Okay, cool, thank you
[14:23:55] <_TWG_> still around taplar?
[14:30:23] <cetabio> hi
[14:31:55] <_TWG_> hi
[15:43:43] <akkufomk> hi
[15:43:51] <taplar> aloha
[15:43:55] <akkufomk> greetings
[16:38:02] <crockstylie> hello :)
[16:38:23] <crockstylie>  Does someone here use ScrollMagic plugin ? http://scrollmagic.io/
[16:57:54] <mib_mib> hi all - is jquery-mobile any good for building an IPAD optimized webapp? Any thoughts?
[17:21:57] <lemondom> hi
[17:22:00] <lemondom> hi
[17:22:52] <lemondom> User drags mouse (mousedown, right?) moves around the arrow, in case the user releases the mouse when the cursor is above some element (let's say a DIV) above the actual surface, no mouserelease is detected
[17:23:02] <lemondom> is there a way to let an element ignore all mouseup/release/drag stop events?
[17:26:04] <NoiseEee> sure, just stop propagation on any of those events
[17:26:07] <NoiseEee> on those elements
[17:26:48] <cetabio> url:"/make/" + $makes.val(),  how can i make it use HTTP instead of HTTPS
[17:30:39] <NoiseEee> provide an absolute path.   "http://somewhere.com/make/" + $makes.val()
[17:31:01] <NoiseEee> lemondom: s/stop propogation/prevent default
[17:31:15] <NoiseEee> https://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/ @ lemondom
[17:32:27] <cetabio> ty Noiseeee
[17:33:59] <lemondom> good
[17:35:26] <lemondom> will jquery on() also apply to all children when I don't use a selector?
[17:35:27] <lemondom> :/
[17:37:09] <arc_> it doesn't apply to all children. i don't know how you could use on() without using a selector though. admittedly i don't know nearly everything about javascript
[17:44:19] <sdwrage>  hey all. I am trying to write a plugin for the first time but I am not attaching it to an element and also need to pass in options to my class I am setting to $.fn.mypluginclass. Is there a decent tutorial for this?
[18:24:13] <bonks> Hi, why would changing the '*' to '> *' cause the callback to be called once instead of twice? $(container).on('loaded', '*', function (e, data) {});
[18:25:12] <bonks> I want to capture from any descendant so I initially used '*', but it kept executing twice.
[18:26:38] <arc_> what is .on('loaded')
[18:28:00] <bonks> I call this in from another script which added a div to $(container): grid.trigger('loaded', { ... });
[18:28:31] <bonks> Actually 2 div levels deep
[18:31:27] <bonks> Hmm I think I just realized that is a selector and isn't even necessary. I could use the class name to specify only when a certain div class triggers
[18:43:28] <sdwrage> for a non element targeting plugin, would it be better to have $.pluginname.init(options); or $(document).pluginname(options);
[18:43:49] <sdwrage> meaning a plugin that doesn't really do anything with html elements.
[20:32:33] <hileo> how do you append a jquery variable to dom?
[20:32:39] <hileo> $jquery
[20:32:41] <hileo> or something
[20:32:42] <hileo> $var
[20:32:46] <hileo> that's a better variable name
[20:48:22] <bonks> Is there an easier way to do this? $(e.currentTarget).parent().parent().siblings().closest('ol')
[20:48:40] <bonks> Because $(e.currentTarget).closest('ol') doesn't return what the above line does
