[10:45:17] <ckb> hey friends why does php json_encode($array) give me a string
[10:45:27] <ckb> jsonlint tells me it's valid json
[10:46:17] <ckb> nevermind XD
[11:21:04] <ckb> Easiest way to search a 2d array for a value?
[11:21:44] <ckb> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4916880/cleanest-way-to-search-a-2d-array this is what I found, but what exactly do I return?
[11:25:57] <ckb> Xgc, best way to search a 2d array https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4916880/cleanest-way-to-search-a-2d-array this is what I found, but what exactly do I return?
[11:26:20] <shoky> what do you want to return..?
[11:26:31] <ckb> the row
[11:26:32] <shoky> a "2d array" is just an array of arrays
[11:27:07] <ckb> I don't understand the logic in that link.
[11:28:13] <ckb> I don't understand the col -= or what I would return if it was a function if I wanted the matching row(s)
[11:28:55] <shoky> myArr.find(subArr => subArr.indexOf(valueToSearch) > -1)      would return the sub-array containing the value
[11:30:01] <ckb> now.... does indexOf take regex?
[11:30:20] <shoky> no
[11:30:29] <ckb> partial matches is necessary
[11:31:01] <shoky> myArr.find(subArr => subArr.find(val => myRegex.test(val)))
[11:32:00] <ckb> subArr => subArr.find(...) doesn't make sense to me
[11:33:11] <shoky> it's inside  myArr.find(...)    it returns the subArr for which subArr.find(...)  is true
[11:35:10] <shoky> and well, i'm assuming you know what arrow functions look like
[11:36:07] <ckb> I'm not that big on ES... as I understand arrow functions are anon functions?
[11:37:00] <shoky> yes..   subArr => subArr.find(...)     is the same as    function(subArr) { return subArr.find(...); }
[11:49:07] <ckb> shoky, can you explain myArr.find(subArr => subArr.indexOf(valueToSearch) > -1) a little bit better?
[11:50:51] <shoky> ckb:  it looks at each sub-array in myArr,  and returns the first sub-array for which  `subArr.indexOf(valueToSearch) > -1`  is true,  i.e. the first sub-array that contains that value
[11:51:21] <ckb> ahhhh
[11:51:26] <ckb> thank you shoky
[11:51:33] <shoky> sure
[11:51:49] <ckb> subArray is aggregated through find()?
[11:52:05] <shoky> ya.  find() loops through the array
[11:52:27] <ckb> so the anon function handles "subArray" definition?
[11:52:35] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find
[11:53:14] <shoky> find() calls the function for each item in the array
[11:53:29] <shoky> until the function returns true/truthy
[11:53:43] <ckb> so it just says find(each(anon))
[11:54:03] <ckb> will that return ALL results? or just the first?
[11:54:10] <shoky> just the first
[11:54:17] <ckb> okay I need all :(
[11:54:32] <shoky> then use .filter() instead of .find()
[11:55:31] * Xgc smiles
[11:55:59] * ckb frowns
[11:56:16] <ckb> So hard to wrap my head around this.
[11:56:17] * shoky blinks
[11:57:27] <shoky> myArr.filter(subArr => subArr.includes(valueToSearch))    gets all sub-arrays that include the value
[11:57:40] <shoky> .includes() is the same as  .indexOf(..) > -1
[11:57:53] <ckb> that's not regex related, right?
[11:57:54] <shoky> (just forgot about it earlier)
[11:57:58] <shoky> nope
[11:58:22] <ckb> k I need partial matches.
[11:58:45] <shoky> myArr.filter(subArr => subArr.find(val => myRegex.test(val)))  gets all sub-arrays which contain a value that matches the regex
[11:58:47] <ckb> (I could do this in PHP 100%)
[11:59:19] <ckb> thank you shoky. Happy Thanksgiving <3
[11:59:32] <shoky> thx. you too
[12:00:33] <ckb> how do I define myRegex?
[12:00:44] <shoky> myRegex = /foo/;
[12:01:25] <shoky> or well,   const myRegex = /foo/;
[12:01:54] <ckb> function searchContacts(q) { var q = /q/; ?
[12:02:40] <shoky> if you just need a partial match of a sub-string, i guess it'd be simpler with .includes,
[12:02:53] * ckb shrugs
[12:03:04] <shoky> myArr.filter(subArr => subArr.find(val => val.includes(q)))
[12:03:45] <shoky> (strings also have a .includes()  which looks for a partial sub-strnig)
[12:03:48] <ckb> I feel so dumb for building a regex parser in Java 8 years ago.
[12:04:20] <shoky> you should feel dumb for feeling dumb for something you did 8 years ago :p
[12:04:34] <ckb> IGNORED
[12:04:37] <ckb> <3
[12:04:44] <shoky> yay now i can dance in the nude
[12:04:55] * ckb peeks.
[12:05:02] <shoky> perv
[12:05:12] <ckb> you're the one that put it out there!
[12:05:16] <ckb> thank you shoky
[12:05:18] <shoky> ;]
[12:05:45] <ckb> you da vip
[12:06:17] <ckb> will filter always return an array?
[12:06:24] <shoky> yep
[12:06:59] <ckb> empty as well?
[12:07:05] <shoky> yea
[12:07:32] <shoky> "The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function."
[12:07:41] <ckb> perfect. I spent so much time trying to do things on my own without the help of what I call the "IRC Gods"
[12:08:18] <ckb> I originally started on EFNet XD
[12:09:11] <shoky> i was still on EFNet until a couple months ago when we finally moved our friends channel to discord :p
[12:09:46] <shoky> i think originally we were on DALNet
[12:10:35] <ckb> Never did DAL..... I was mainly #mindspring on EFNet (1997-2001)
[12:10:55] <ckb> but I was a baby
[12:11:26] <shoky> heh
[12:12:46] <ckb> don't laugh at me, you old hag!
[12:12:47] <ckb> <3
[12:13:39] <ckb> shoky, seriously you and Xgc helped me through a major brain block
[12:15:12] <ckb> EFNet is still a thing?
[12:15:51] <shoky> yepp, tho no idea which channels are still active
[12:16:24] <ckb> freenode is bae
[12:18:25] <ckb> okay is there a generic key change event?
[12:18:45] <ckb> or do I just do on keyup keydown?
[12:19:41] <shoky> 'input'
[12:19:41] <ckb> .on('keyup, keydown', .....)
[12:19:48] <shoky> .on('input',...)
[12:19:52] <ckb> oooo
[12:19:58] <shoky> covers keypress, pastes, etc
[12:20:36] <ckb> I was about to ask wouldn't pastes be keyed
[12:20:47] <ckb> but I know better
[12:21:06] * ckb laughs
[12:22:14] <ckb> does input do keydowns over keyups?
[12:22:48] <ckb> so like should I use "input" for all of my inputs?
[12:23:32] <ckb> is it just a mix of change and keyups?
[12:25:29] <ckb> AND a more serious question, can I style input[type="time/date"] now?
[12:32:50] <shoky> i donno but i wouldn't count on it
[12:33:11] <shoky> and even if possible, probably not fun at all
[12:53:42] <ckb> shoky, subArr undefined :(
[12:54:04] <ckb> do I need a .each?
[13:34:46] <shoky> ckb donno what you're doing..
[16:56:07] <Destramic> i have a plugin which creates a multi-select checkbox, but when i try to add validation underneath it doesnt work as the plugin take longer to init than the added validation underneath...
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:42] <robertmaxrees> does the plguin rely on some kind of async operation?
[16:56:48] <Destramic> nope
[16:57:06] <robertmaxrees> then what do youy mean "the plugin take longer to init"?
[16:57:23] <robertmaxrees> unless it's an async operation, so long as that code comes first, you're fine.
[16:57:27] <Destramic> omg!
[16:57:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:57:43] <Destramic> my plugin changes the name of the fields adding [] at the end
[16:57:54] <Destramic> ffs, wrong name on validation field name
[16:58:04] <Destramic> my bad..
[17:13:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
