[01:18:15] <C291> I think I narrowed it down. jquery mobile and jquery regular are both required for the form to format correctly, but the form doesn't submit if they're both there.  Any ideas? http://jsbin.com/keyituxiji/edit?html,output
[03:13:11] <spongie> Hello. I just started using jquery, it's working fine. However, I downloaded a plugin called select2 to style selects, I'm puzzled as to what I should include. The tarball has a huge number of .js files, including i18n support. I'm not sure how to "install" it and use it with my other jquery stuff. There is no makefile etc. What files should I copy to get the plugin working?
[03:13:42] <Cork> spongie: normally there is a .min.js file that should be all the js you need
[03:13:50] <Cork> spongie: the rest is the "source code"
[03:14:00] <Cork> there might also be a css file in there you need too
[03:14:09] <spongie> Ah, it was under a directory called "dist"
[03:14:29] * Cork nods
[03:21:38] <spongie> Oh nice. It has a builtin autocompleter.
[03:21:45] <spongie> Cork: thanks for the heads up
[03:21:49] <Cork> np
[03:22:14] <Cork> spongie: be warned though, make sure it works satisfactory for mobile devices
[03:22:22] <spongie> My site looks like a programmer built it = crap, but got some snazzy widgets now.
[03:22:25] <Cork> they usually use a different ui then what you see on desktop
[03:23:05] <spongie> Cork: desktop only. I'm doing this instead of writing a gtk3 app that I have to maintain for multiple platforms and install on multiple, geographically very separated locations
[03:23:47] <Cork> well it is still good to know what the risk is of using libs like that
[03:24:11] <spongie> when it comes to web i am jon snow
[03:25:36] <spongie> I saw some workarounds for selects using ul's, but I'm using input controls from autogenerated from django forms.
[03:26:11] <Cork> personally i prefer lightly styling the default ui (remove the buttons and add a background image)
[03:26:24] <Cork> as then you keep the browsers default behaviour the user is used to
[03:30:47] <undefined_bob> can this code http://jsbin.com/davakazeyu/edit?html,output
[03:30:56] <undefined_bob> cause this http://imgur.com/a/r2eye
[03:31:11] <Cork> please use something other then jsbin
[03:31:12] <undefined_bob> I'm trying to figure out whats wrong but
[03:31:26] <undefined_bob> oh okay
[03:31:39] <Cork> it tends to break all over the place
[03:31:47] <Cork> jsfiddle is prefered
[03:32:50] <Cork> undefined_bob: also the html that is affected is needed (unless you include it but jsbin just lost it)
[03:33:30] <undefined_bob> let me check, Cork
[03:33:53] <undefined_bob> ye something got lost. weird
[03:34:09] <Cork> ya, it suckes bad sadly, it used to be really good
[03:35:05] <Cork> the reason jsfiddle is prefered is cause it has a manual save button, so you don't lose changes when more then person use it
[03:35:22] <Cork> (that most of the other ones do)
[03:36:08] <undefined_bob> but its a bit tricky to paste all the affected html code because there are parts of a proprietary language which wont be interpret
[03:36:24] <Cork> ya, you don't need all of the original code
[03:36:41] <Cork> you need the raw html elemnts that you toggle and the css styling them
[03:36:50] <Cork> so that the effect is visible in jsfiddle
[03:36:58] <Cork> cause else the answer will be "possibly"
[03:37:20] <Cork> as the code you pasted can case most anything depending on what other things happens on the page
[03:40:17] <undefined_bob> I understand, Cork
[03:41:03] <undefined_bob> I cant really reproduce the bahavior in the fiddle but here is the raw code https://jsfiddle.net/yn96o8tL/
[03:41:24] <undefined_bob> the test page url is http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[03:41:50] <Cork> and when does the problem happen there?
[03:42:37] <undefined_bob> the problem appears when I resize the browser and click on the sub menu toggle, I get a huge blank square below the bar and the drop down menu expand below that square.
[03:43:33] <Cork> the child ul is not position absolute
[03:43:34] <undefined_bob> I think it happen when the script detect a specific browser window size and then switch to something like a mobile view
[03:43:43] <Cork> that is why it goes bonkers for you
[03:44:06] <Cork> the flex parent will count the added height for the flyout menu as it is part of the page flow
[03:44:34] <undefined_bob> ohh
[03:45:09] <Cork> make the parent li a position: relative; and the child ul position: absolute and your problem should go away
[03:49:01] <undefined_bob> I try to figure out which is the parent and which are the childs. I still get confused by that
[03:49:08] <undefined_bob> its all kinda new for me
[03:49:48] <Cork> <ul class="menu"><li class="parent"><ul class="flyout"><li class="entries"></li></ul></li></ul>
[03:52:21] <undefined_bob> you mean in the css code, right?
[03:52:48] <Cork> that is the html, but yes you should set it in the css for the "parent" and "flyout" element
[03:53:02] <Cork> what ever the css in your page is for that
[03:54:00] <Cork> .sub-menu and .has-sub-menu it looks like
[03:54:21] <Cork> (the browsers dom inspector is normally grate help here)
[03:54:30] <Cork> opps
[03:54:38] <undefined_bob> wb
[03:54:42] <Cork> :)
[03:55:32] <undefined_bob> you are very kind, its all so confusing me. I try my best but still feeling 'stupid'
[03:56:18] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you haven't done it before it is nothing strange in feeling overwhelmed, so no reason to feel stupid
[03:56:41] <Cork> just keep at it and you will get the hang of it over time
[03:57:42] <Cork> flyout menus is quite confusing the first time you do it, i still remember the first time i did it >_>
[03:58:37] <undefined_bob> yes, it really is
[03:59:02] <undefined_bob> so many ul and li and classes and so on :o
[03:59:40] <Cork> well you technically don't need anything except the dom relation to make the menu, but the classes can make it simpler to follow (and makes the css more compact)
[04:00:00] <undefined_bob> and I only have little basic knowledge of html, php, js and jq
[04:00:39] <Cork> no time like the present to further the knowledge :)
[04:01:18] <undefined_bob> true :)
[04:02:07] <undefined_bob> I'm still trying to find the correct classes in the css code because there are so many with .sub-menu and .has-sub-menu
[04:05:48] <undefined_bob> I have '.has-sub-menu .has-sub-menu:hover .sub-menu' with position:absolute; and '.site-nav li:hover > .sub-menu' with position:absolute; too
[04:55:36] <Cork> undefined_bob: those are for when you show the sub menu when you hover the parent
[04:55:51] <Cork> undefined_bob: you show them by clicking the menu expander
[04:56:18] <Cork> so you most likely want to look at the .js .has-sub-menu and selectors like that
[05:06:35] <undefined_bob> Cork: ah I see. Because I tried it here and there but didnt find the right class yet
[05:06:40] <undefined_bob> I try more :)
[05:12:49] <undefined_bob> Cork: I have four classes with .js: '.js .site-nav', '.js .sub-menu', '.js .toggle-sub-menu' and '.js .toggle-sub-menu.active'
[05:13:22] <Cork> .js .sub-menu is the one you want to have position: active on
[05:13:26] <undefined_bob> I added position:relative to '.js .sub-menu'
[05:13:37] <Cork> and you want to add a .js .has-sub-menu { position: relative }
[05:13:51] <undefined_bob> oh
[05:13:51] <Cork> ...
[05:13:53] <Cork> active...
[05:13:54] <Cork> T_T
[05:14:03] <Cork> * .js .sub-menu is the one you want to have position: absolute on
[05:15:11] <undefined_bob> I try it now :)
[05:15:26] <Cork> you might have to set something like top: 100%; left: 0; or something like that on sub-menu
[05:15:46] <Cork> else it might cover the parent completely
[05:17:21] <undefined_bob> .js .sub-menu has display:none anyway
[05:17:42] <Cork> ya, but you need it for when it is shown
[05:21:35] <undefined_bob> I added it and now I try
[05:24:40] <undefined_bob> Cork: omg it works :)
[05:24:54] <Cork> :)
[05:25:04] <undefined_bob> you can check it here: http://undefined.bplaced.net/
[05:25:21] <undefined_bob> thank you very much for your help :)
[05:25:41] <Cork> undefined_bob: ah, you want to also handle .js .sub-menu .sub-menu
[05:25:58] <Cork> else you will have problem with the sub sub menus ending up under the first
[05:26:46] <undefined_bob> ja I saw that at the menu 'Testseite3'
[05:27:14] <undefined_bob> but I'm happy that the main 'bug' is gone now
[05:27:33] <Cork> just setting something like .js .sub-menu .sub-menu { top: 0; left: 100%; } should solve that
[05:36:29] <undefined_bob> Cork: yay that works too
[05:37:04] <undefined_bob> really nice, thank you so much for your kind help :)

[05:38:37] <xenaxon> hello! Please help!
[05:38:39] <xenaxon> Is it possible to make 1-button print to pdf, without going to the print screen?
[05:38:42] <xenaxon> how could I do this
[05:41:05] <undefined_bob> xenaxon: as far as I know the browser wont let you print directly
[05:41:20] <undefined_bob> I assume you want to print 'out of the browser'?
[05:43:47] <undefined_bob> you could set up your printer with google cloud print and then use the cloud print API, like a workaround
[05:56:10] <xenaxon> undefined_bob: no, I want to save to pdf, but the print screen has a functionality to save to pdf as destination format, instead of printer>paper
[05:57:00] <undefined_bob> ah okay I see
[05:57:02] <xenaxon> there is the function which is window.print()
[05:57:20] <xenaxon> i placed it on a button and when clicked, it opens up the print screen
[06:00:20] <xenaxon> but it opens it up with the print to paper option, I want it to open up with save to pdf selected
[06:00:53] <xenaxon> or better yet, the optimal solution would be to directly open up the save file window, and skip the print-preview part
[06:00:58] <xenaxon> does anybody know how?
[06:01:08] <undefined_bob> do you have a virtual pdf printer installed?
[06:01:22] <undefined_bob> you can change the default printer then
[06:01:37] <xenaxon> you don't understand
[06:02:04] <xenaxon> click print in your browser
[06:02:09] <xenaxon> and you will see print preview
[06:02:14] <undefined_bob> yes
[06:02:16] <xenaxon> on the left, there is Destination (select button)
[06:02:34] <xenaxon> click Change destination, and select pdf
[06:04:34] <undefined_bob> depends, my browser has a different print window. and I have installed a pdf printer and made it the default printer. so its always the first option when I want to print something.
[06:04:43] <undefined_bob> I'm not sure if I really get what you want
[06:05:18] <undefined_bob> maybe this can help you: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28522749/save-web-page-directly-to-pdf-using-js
[06:09:09] <xenaxon> undefined_bob: so the answer is no, its not possible
[06:09:36] <undefined_bob> not in the easy way, as far as I know
[06:11:22] <toothfairy_> Hi... This js is supposed to load content within the iframe at the current page only, but sometimes for some reason I don't understand it opens up the iframe content as a new page. How do I prevent this?  https://dpaste.de/r6eB
[06:35:55] <undefined_bob> Cork: when I open the page on my mobile, the drop down menu appears a little bit too high, like it lay behind the main menu bar. see https://goo.gl/siZ9Q2
[06:36:25] <undefined_bob> any push into the right direction? :)
[07:00:01] <Rixon> could somebody explain to me why this console.log is working but the toggle() isn't? https://jsfiddle.net/2246nL76/2/
[07:03:43] <Rixon> I just tried removing .prop('hidden', 'hidden') and just using hide(); after append(); and not even that hide(); works
[07:08:49] <Cork> undefined_bob: "Anfrage & Kontakt" is line broken so it is higher
[07:09:05] <Cork> undefined_bob: i suspect Testseite3 isn't the full height of the menu bar
[07:09:22] <Cork> you can fix that with the flex parent
[07:10:59] <Cork> Rixon: https://jsfiddle.net/2246nL76/3/
[07:11:07] <Cork> the selector doesn't match anything
[07:12:48] <Rixon> yeah but I'm trying to understand why? there is reallya  div with that ID in the DOM... this is all in $(document).ready(function(){});
[07:14:21] <Rixon> is it because I'm assigning .on('click') during the creation of that div? should I do .on('click') after?
[07:16:29] <Rixon> ... ok that's not worked either
[07:17:00] <undefined_bob> Cork: thank you :) I try to find the correct parent
[07:20:31] <Rixon> I've actually just typed $('#hist_m_test_1').length into firefox's console whilst inspecting the DOM and looking at that very element with that very ID and it still tells me length is 0
[07:20:36] <Rixon> I can see it should be 1
[07:20:42] <Rixon> I am sooo confused
[07:24:12] <localh0st> Rixon: 1. toggle() changes display property, not 'hidden'
[07:24:58] <localh0st> 2. your element in DOM is div##hist_m_test_1.modal_history
[07:25:02] <localh0st> (double #)
[07:25:16] <localh0st> this is fixed version: https://jsfiddle.net/2246nL76/5/
[07:26:09] <Rixon> ohhhh
[07:26:47] <Rixon> so .attr 'id' prepends with #?
[07:27:09] <localh0st> looks like ;)
[07:27:38] <Rixon> no, you've manually done it in the selector
[07:27:40] <Rixon> so what changed?
[07:27:55] <Rixon> except moving it out of the variable and concatenating in the selector
[07:27:56] <Rixon> nothing?
[07:27:59] <Rixon> =/
[07:28:09] <Rixon> oh it was
[07:28:15] <Rixon> ok thanks =)
[07:53:23] <Rixon> that's a bit of a gotchya ain't it
[07:53:23] <Rixon> haha
[07:55:51] <Rixon> there is literally nothing on .attr() documentation saying that this happens
[07:56:18] <Cork> Rixon: .attr should basically never be used
[07:56:26] <Rixon> there's even an example that uses 'id' and still just glosses over the fact that you don't need to add a #
[07:56:31] <Cork> you should only use it if .prop gives you the wrong effect
[07:57:12] <Uhkis> why on earth would anyone prepend id with # ?
[07:57:35] <Rixon> ...because you can't select an id without one?
[07:57:36] <Cork> if they think it needs to include what you use in the selector?
[07:57:44] <Cork> Rixon: # means you select an id
[07:57:48] <Rixon> yes
[07:57:55] <Cork> if # is in the id how would it difference it from an element selector?
[07:58:06] <Rixon> exactly
[07:58:19] <Cork> Rixon: your missing the point
[07:58:21] <Uhkis> attr('id', 'bla') means id="bla" which would be $('#bla')
[07:58:27] <Rixon> yes
[07:58:29] <Rixon> I see that
[07:58:29] <Cork> .attr doesn't do anything
[07:58:41] <Cork> its that css selectors does something
[07:58:47] <Cork> # means id in css
[07:58:51] <Rixon> yes I see that
[07:58:56] <Cork> and that is where the difference comes from
[07:59:06] <Rixon> I think we're kind of arguing the same point here
[07:59:12] <Rixon> I understand
[07:59:24] <Cork> then why did you sai documentation for .attr should say anything?
[07:59:28] <Cork> *say
[08:00:08] <Rixon> maybe just a hint about what we just discussed would be useful?
[08:00:43] <Cork> so it should have documentation that 1. id will have # prefixed when you select it, 2. class will have . and . replaced for spaces
[08:01:00] <Cork> and 3. attributes will have [<attribute name>=""]
[08:01:00] <Rixon> no that's not what I'm saying
[08:01:15] <Cork> that would basically require the entire selector documentation in .attr
[08:01:29] <Rixon> ... yes, again that's not what I'm saying
[08:01:37] <Cork> then what are you saying?
[08:03:24] <Rixon> just "don't put a # in .attr('id',...)" or something, I didn't say anything about merging in the whole documentation for how HTML works with classes and other attributes
[08:03:45] <Cork> but it is perfectly valid to put # in the id
[08:04:12] <Rixon> oh come on, you know what I mean - now you're just being pedantic about being allowed hashes in id names
[08:04:26] <Cork> no, i'm perfectly serious
[08:04:45] <Cork> id has no limitation what characters you are allowed to have in it
[08:04:56] <Rixon> ... you still know what I meant and you're intentionally ignoring what I mean
[08:05:00] <Cork> it is up to the css selector to escape css selector special characters
[08:05:04] <Cork> no, i don't
[08:05:06] <Rixon> ... yes, I know.
[08:05:13] <Cork> you want .attr to say things about things it has nothing to do with
[08:05:16] <Rixon> I didn't say "you're not allowed a # in id"
[08:05:20] <Rixon> no, I don't
[08:05:29] <Rixon> look you're twisting my words and being pedantic
[08:05:53] <Rixon> ... never mind, I got the answer to the question I wanted, thanks.
[08:05:56] <Cork> how else would "don't put # in id be relevant to .attr, except cause it means you have to write escaped \# in the css selector?
[08:06:13] <Rixon> no, again that is not what I meant
[08:06:24] <Rixon> now you're really taking what I said to the next level
[08:06:37] <Cork> @_@' i am??
[08:06:41] <Rixon> you are
[08:06:44] <Cork> then i again have no clue what you're saying
[08:06:55] <Rixon> indeed.
[08:07:08] <Cork> cause "don't put a # in .attr('id',...)" was what i quoted and i was still not referencing to what you meant so...
[08:07:21] <Rixon> yeah I meant "there's no need to prepend with #"
[08:07:25] <Rixon> and you knew I meant that
[08:07:32] <Cork> it is, if you want it to have it -_-'
[08:07:36] <Rixon> and decided to take it as far as "you're alloweed to use # if you escape"... blah
[08:07:43] <Cork> again, attr doesn't have anything to do with css selectors
[08:07:47] <Rixon> I know
[08:07:57] <Cork> you have mixed them together and that is where you're problem comes from not from attr
[08:08:05] <Rixon> yes, I know
[08:08:10] <Cork> so saying that in attr would be wrong
[08:08:20] <Rixon> ... you knew what I meant
[08:08:29] <Rixon> the whole prepending thing
[08:08:33] <Cork> no i seriously don't
[08:08:55] <Rixon> you just confirmed that you did by explaining where my problem comes from even though I am understanding and agreeing
[08:09:09] <Cork> cause that would be just as valid for "don't prefix classes with . in .attr('class', 'className')"
[08:09:13] <Rixon> you are literally arguing my own arguent at me and telling me you don't know you're doing it
[08:09:19] <Cork> but there you thought i was taking it to the extream
[08:09:23] <Rixon> yes I'm sure it would
[08:09:24] <Cork> but it still the exact same thing
[08:09:51] <Rixon> no that's not what I meant by taking it to the extreme, I meant when you said it's valid to have a  in id as long as you escape it
[08:09:55] <Rixon> just never mind
[08:10:05] <Rixon> the argument is done, we both understand and agree but you don'tseem to realise
[08:10:10] <shoky> i think you can stop now :)
[08:10:14] <Rixon> yes
[08:10:15] <Rixon> =)
[08:10:17] <Cork> no we don't understand, well at least i don't
[08:10:27] <Cork> but ya, i won't argue with you
[08:35:51] <undefined_bob> Cork: haven't found the the correct parent yet :o but I'm still trying. and thanks for the hint
[08:36:25] <Cork> undefined_bob: what do you mean the correct parent?
[08:36:36] <Cork> ah you mean the flex parent?
[08:36:43] <undefined_bob> ya
[08:37:03] <undefined_bob> I used flex only with one class
[08:37:15] <Cork> if you inspect the menu in the browser
[08:37:20] <Cork> you have the <nav> element
[08:37:30] <Cork> and directly inside it you have an ul element
[08:37:33] <undefined_bob> yes
[08:37:40] <Cork> the css section there will show you "display: flex"
[08:37:48] <Cork> THAT is the selector i was talking about
[08:37:57] <Cork> so .site-nav>ul
[08:46:53] <undefined_bob> re
[08:47:47] <undefined_bob> Cork: I'm sorry, did you write something?
[08:47:58] <Cork> heh i did :)
[08:48:22] <Cork> the css section there will show you "display: flex"
[08:48:28] <Cork> THAT is the selector i was talking about
[08:48:28] <Cork> so .site-nav>ul
[08:48:33] <Cork> was the last i wrote
[08:48:39] <undefined_bob> router was grumpy and disconnected
[08:49:01] <Cork> was going to say you should set align-items: stretch, but for some reason i'm not sure of why it doesn't work for that menu...
[08:49:34] <undefined_bob> hm how do you know it doesnt work?
[08:49:48] <Cork> cause i tried it
[08:50:10] <undefined_bob> hm
[08:51:44] <undefined_bob> I'm thinking about what I have done to the menu
[08:53:14] <undefined_bob> but its still difficult for me to identify which part of the code is responsible for what I see
[08:53:25] <Cork> ah, there we go
[08:53:58] <Cork> undefined_bob: .site-nav li needs to be inline-flex instead of inline-block
[08:54:40] <Cork> hmm, though that breaks the expander click... damn...
[08:55:28] <hellyeah> hey
[08:55:30] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/255ryrst/8/
[08:55:42] <undefined_bob> I'm not satisfied with the expander button anyway but thats my next construction side
[08:55:49] <hellyeah> ops
[08:56:12] <Cork> ah, now i see why
[08:56:27] <Cork> undefined_bob: i missed that you set the background color in the <a> element
[08:56:43] <Cork> so align-items: stretch didn't adjust the gray area
[08:57:05] <Cork> so align-items: stretch fixes the problem you asked about, but not the background color problem
[08:57:41] <Cork> setting display: flex or display: inline-flex on the li means the a gets stretched
[08:58:07] <undefined_bob> complicated
[08:58:27] <Cork> undefined_bob: i would prob make it so hovering the element sets the class, will most likely be annoying if you have to click it to see the sub menus
[08:59:30] <undefined_bob> you get the hovering effect when you load the page on normal desktop
[08:59:48] <undefined_bob> its just different when the menu detect other viewport
[08:59:56] <undefined_bob> or a mobile device
[09:00:30] <undefined_bob> then it switch its behavior
[09:01:08] <undefined_bob> and hover on mobile devices is not the best solution, afaik
[09:01:19] <undefined_bob> thats why I did it that way
[09:02:02] <undefined_bob> maybe I can set the background color not in the <a>?
[09:06:26] <Cork> sure, but the click area will differ for where you can click on the link
[09:06:45] <Cork> about the hover, sorry not sure what i thought, of course you can't have hover for touch -_-'
[09:07:13] <undefined_bob> you mean the area will differ because of the flex?
[09:07:44] <Cork> no, if you don't stretch the a tag to take up the entire li, you will have the background, but if you click at the bottom it won't be the link
[09:07:55] <Cork> the same problem exists in the normal menu
[09:08:24] <undefined_bob> ah ya I understand
[09:08:30] <Cork> actually, you could just set white-space: nowrap; on the ul and be done with it :)
[09:08:43] <Cork> though then the user will have to side scroll and that sucks
[09:09:42] <undefined_bob> I just added the align-items: stretch to .site-nav>ul and display: inline-flex; to .side-nav li and I see what you meant with the broken expander button
[09:10:13] <undefined_bob> ja side scroll sucks
[09:10:37] <Cork> might just be you have to change how you position the expander, never looked at how you did that
[09:11:15] <undefined_bob> i didnt give the expander its final form and position yet
[09:12:05] <undefined_bob> the expander is created within .js .toggle-sub-menu
[09:12:51] <undefined_bob> why are menu so complicated and annoying or is it just me? :o
[09:13:10] <Cork> ah, its just that you have a z-index that is now actually working :)
[09:13:53] <Cork> if you reset .site-nav a { z-index } to something like 2 it will work
[09:14:09] <undefined_bob> I just gave the expander class a higher z-index
[09:14:13] <undefined_bob> and will try now
[09:14:16] <Cork> works too :)
[09:14:35] <Cork> you are using quite high numbers though
[09:15:34] <Cork> undefined_bob: have you thought about making the menu vertical for touch?
[09:17:38] <undefined_bob> Cork: ya I thought about but I didnt know how to make this menu vertically when it detect mobile device or a tiny viewport
[09:18:08] <undefined_bob> and then I tought it might work horizontally too
[09:20:21] <Cork> undefined_bob: .site-nav>ul { flex-direction: column; }
[09:20:30] <Cork> will take you about 90% there
[09:21:15] <undefined_bob> I'll try it
[09:21:31] <undefined_bob> and yay the higher z-index worked
[09:21:42] <undefined_bob> the expander is not clickable again
[09:22:00] <Cork> it is here
[09:22:39] <undefined_bob> but when I open the page in chrome on my mobile the menu didnt adjust to the screen and I have to scroll horizontally
[09:23:04] <Cork> might be cause the width limit you have is too low
[09:23:16] <Cork> mobile devices are quite high res now days
[09:23:38] <undefined_bob> hm
[09:24:47] <Cork> my mobile for example is 1080px width
[09:25:01] <undefined_bob> no it more looks like the whole menu bar is too large now. the most left item is cut off too
[09:25:02] <Cork> so good luck detecting it from a normal mobitor :D
[09:25:12] <undefined_bob> haha ya
[09:26:15] <undefined_bob> I mean the line break at 'anfrage & kontakt' is gone, the expander does his job and the sub menu expand fine
[09:26:23] <undefined_bob> thats great at all :)
[09:27:06] <Cork> you could set flex-wrap: wrap; on the parent
[09:27:15] <Cork> and prevent the li from growing
[09:27:26] <Cork> that might give an ok look
[09:27:56] <undefined_bob> you mean on the .site-nav li ?
[09:28:16] <Cork> hmm you most likely want the first level only
[09:28:35] <Cork> but you could try with it
[09:29:55] <undefined_bob> to identify the correct parents and childs is still complicated and confusing :D
[09:30:55] <undefined_bob> and maybe the width:100%; isnt correct at .site-nav li anymore
[09:54:25] <undefined_bob> Cork: no, it doesnt work like that. the bar is nuking the design :(
[09:54:42] <undefined_bob> it didnt adjust
[10:33:50] <undefined_bob> Cork: are you here tomorrow too?
[10:34:07] <Cork> sure, though i will be away from time to time (just like today)
[10:34:41] <undefined_bob> nice :) maybe you are in the mood and have time to with me togehter at the code again?
[10:34:56] <undefined_bob> *look
[10:35:01] <Cork> depends on how deep a look :)
[10:35:27] <Cork> giving hints won't be a problem
[10:35:50] <undefined_bob> ya sure, I dont want a step by step help
[10:36:06] <undefined_bob> thats lame, I want to learn how to do it by myself :)
[10:36:16] <Cork> heh
[10:36:49] <undefined_bob> everything is fine now, except the mobile view
[10:37:14] <undefined_bob> desktop at full and resized screen is fine
[10:37:38] <undefined_bob> but the bar doesnt adjust to mobile screen anymore now
[10:38:06] <undefined_bob> but thats for tomorrow :)
[10:46:36] <undefined_bob> so, see you tomorrow :)
[10:52:46] <galgamach> Hi all. I have a piece of code inside a $("document").ready(function(){})  There is a small gif that loads when leave a field and when this happens my code stop working.  I also tried it in a window load  block but nothing. Any hint ?
[10:53:23] <taplar> a gif loading should cause logic to pause at all
[10:53:38] <taplar> *shouldn't
[11:11:04] <galgamach> taplar, I don't think it stops it... it just .. I don't know. It's like my script loads only once or something
[11:12:30] <taplar> can you show us what you are trying?
[11:32:25] <sammyg> on js fiddle do i include the body tags?
[11:32:42] <taplar> no
[11:35:15] <sammyg> so everything inside the body?
[11:35:38] <taplar> markup goes in the body part, script in the script part, css in the css part
[11:35:51] <taplar> you just don't include the wrapper tags.  jsfiddle adds those for you
[11:41:13] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/Le4zrudd/6/
[11:41:34] <sammyg> i tried to make a test case
[11:41:53] <taplar> that's not a valid use for the doc ready
[11:42:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Le4zrudd/7/
[11:43:15] <sammyg> load type onload you mean?
[11:43:35] <taplar> you were missing the function(){} part of the document ready
[11:43:45] <taplar> you were putting just the bindings inside the ()
[11:44:22] <sammyg> oh ok right
[11:44:41] <sammyg> but i need that document ready? i notice js fiddle has something of its own for this?
[11:44:45] <taplar> also "mydiv" isn't a valid selector
[11:45:10] <taplar> if you put your logic at the bottom of the page, you don't need the document ready at all
[11:45:16] <sammyg> omg so many errors :p
[11:46:44] <sammyg> how do you fix indents?
[11:46:51] <sammyg> oh right tidy
[11:47:04] <sammyg> maybe not...
[11:48:58] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/Le4zrudd/8/
[11:52:28] <sammyg> right, now it works as i wanted, thanks taplar
[11:52:43] <taplar> np
[11:53:25] <sammyg> ok, so now what i was trying to do is make the img stay transparent, then click the button and it appears
[11:53:35] <sammyg> that's why i have that button on there
[11:53:58] <sammyg> so i changed to on click listener
[11:54:35] <sammyg> and then used fadeIn() to instead of fadeTo() but could not get it to work
[11:55:43] <taplar> so, start off transparent, and if you click the button show it?
[11:57:11] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/zyggpyzq/
[11:57:26] <sammyg> yes
[11:57:36] <sammyg> something like the above
[11:57:56] <sammyg> ("#ex6 img").fadeTo("slow", 1.0);
[11:58:08] <sammyg> $("#ex6 img").fadeIn();
[11:58:18] <taplar> what should happen if it is clicked a second time?
[11:58:19] <sammyg> that's the replacement i tried on my computer but it broke down somehow
[11:58:35] <sammyg> no action on second click
[11:58:46] <sammyg> it stays put
[11:59:07] <taplar> then all you are missing is to default the opacity in the css to 0.2
[12:00:47] <sammyg> yeah something like that, you see i added a css style for that but no property
[12:00:54] <taplar> right.....
[12:01:02] <sammyg> but i was thinking, how is fadeIn() different from fadeTo()?
[12:01:35] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[12:01:51] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[12:02:43] <taplar> "The .fadeIn() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. It is similar to the .fadeTo() method but that method does not unhide the element and can specify the final opacity level."
[12:03:45] <sammyg> so fadeIn() and fadeOut() are like completely on and completely off? similar to show and hide, but with fading effect?
[12:04:01] <sammyg> and fadeTo() is for setting opacity level?
[12:04:14] <taplar> pretty much
[12:04:37] <taplar> fadeIn/fadeOut do so by changing the opacity also, but they perform the show/hide at the end
[12:05:00] <sammyg> ok cool
[12:05:02] <taplar> fadeOut() will opacity 1 -0, and then at the end do a hide
[12:05:13] <sammyg> so like built in fadeIn and show
[12:05:21] <taplar> fadeIn() will set opacity to zero, show it, then 0 - 1
[12:06:01] <sammyg> oh ok
[12:06:06] <taplar> personally though i'd probably just use a css transition for this though
[12:06:31] <taplar> and just add the class with the opacity of 1
[12:07:23] <sammyg> well i am supposed to be learning jquery that's the reason i do it like this, but i would love to look at your css example...
[12:07:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zyggpyzq/1/
[12:09:53] <sammyg> cool man :) thanks!
[12:42:00] <hellyeah> what do you think about select2
[12:42:31] <taplar> it's ok
[12:42:47] <hellyeah> hm
[12:44:50] <hellyeah> can i show you my blog
[12:45:15] <taplar> i think you've showed it before, but go for it
[12:45:25] <Uhkis> chosen > select2
[12:46:52] <hellyeah> i added many things

[13:14:44] <taplar> not sure if we have that one
[13:14:56] <taplar> ah, ps4, nah we don't
[13:15:26] <kof> ALL PS games are good
[13:15:57] <AwkwardCough> all?
[13:17:09] <kof> yes you can check them out for 1st time :D
[13:18:14] <hellyeah> ahahaha
[13:46:30] <plamb> to update a value in an <input> should i be using .prop or .attr?
[13:46:44] <taplar> val()
[13:47:30] <plamb> oh right
[13:47:31] <plamb> lol
[13:48:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:01:51] <taplar> wow, looks like github is having some sort of network issue
[14:02:48] <robertmaxrees> looks like a cors issue with their stylesheets.
[14:03:12] <taplar> i tried to go to one of them directly and got a 404
[14:03:29] <taplar> or atleast their 404 page
[14:04:08] <taplar> hope they have their files backed up in a github
[14:06:52] <taplar> maybe it's a sign.  i was just thinking of trying out their github pages feature
[14:10:23] <Uhkis> taplar: there seems to be some CORS problem with the css at least :-D
[14:10:45] <Uhkis> looks pretty hilarious
[14:10:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:11:36] <Uhkis> ...as robertmaxrees already seemed to tell you :D
[14:13:27] <Uhkis> one would think github has enough people to fix things like that immediately
[14:13:42] <taplar> it's fixed now
[14:13:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:13:52] <robertmaxrees> stuff like that can be a little complex.
[14:28:47] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/5/
[14:29:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2qL7ftgs/7/
[14:36:37] <sammyg> robertmaxrees, i can't tell what change you made? except for white space edits
[14:37:25] <taplar> the one you linked didn't have jquery included
[14:37:36] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/qjINEnU.png
[14:38:25] <sammyg> omg..... i am such a noob
[14:38:31] <sammyg> thanks! :)
[14:38:45] * sammyg smacks himself on the forehead
[14:41:21] <hollusion> whats the go to way to load hhtml from another domain into a javascript variable
[14:41:48] <robertmaxrees> ajax
[14:42:29] <hollusion> but that only work for the current pages domain
[14:42:33] <hollusion> doesnt it?
[14:42:50] <robertmaxrees> unless CORS is enabled on the other server.
[14:43:03] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can't get the other page without your own server.
[14:43:33] <taplar> what on the other site are you trying to put on your own site?
[14:44:42] <sammyg> can i nest regular for loops inside anonymous functions in jquery?
[14:44:57] <taplar> a function is a function
[14:45:16] <robertmaxrees> why couldn't you?
[14:45:46] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/16/
[14:45:48] <taplar> r/"in jquery"/"in javascript"
[14:46:10] <robertmaxrees> ing?
[14:46:12] <robertmaxrees> *int
[14:46:45] <taplar> crack open your browser console
[14:46:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[14:46:57] <robertmaxrees> sammyg there's no int keyword in js.
[14:47:42] <sammyg> *facepalm*
[14:47:51] <sammyg> of course... of course...
[14:48:01] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/17/
[14:48:07] <taplar> you're not thinking of using the 'i' in place of the number in the id selector are you?
[14:48:08] <robertmaxrees> var
[14:48:26] <robertmaxrees> he wants to flash the image a preset number of times i'm guessing?
[14:48:28] <sammyg> that's what happens when you learn several languages in parallel :p
[14:48:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2qL7ftgs/18/
[14:48:44] <robertmaxrees> sammyg you want var, otherwise it's a global var.  which is bad.
[14:49:15] <sammyg> ok
[14:50:02] <taplar> seriously though, what are you planning the loop for
[14:51:19] <sammyg> taplar, i want it look like cameras going off, flashing :)
[14:51:42] <sammyg> the loop is by 1 off, it needs to stay at 1.0 opacity
[14:51:42] <robertmaxrees> a preset number of times?
[14:51:58] <sammyg> about 10 times would be ok
[14:52:24] <taplar> i forget if fadeTo queues up or not
[14:52:51] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/19/
[14:53:03] <robertmaxrees> still missing var
[14:53:09] <robertmaxrees> for (var i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
[14:53:14] <sammyg> i switched line 4 and 5
[14:53:36] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/20/
[14:53:39] <sammyg> :)
[14:53:42] <taplar> you should perform the lookup outside of the loop
[14:53:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:53:50] <robertmaxrees> and store it in a var.
[14:54:51] <sammyg> lookup?
[14:55:11] <taplar> $("#ex6 img") is a selector or lookup
[14:55:23] <taplar> you're looking up elements in the dom
[14:55:38] <sammyg> ok
[14:57:00] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/21/
[14:57:04] <sammyg> wow it seems faster now :9
[14:57:18] <taplar> lol, no
[14:57:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:57:34] <taplar> store the result of $(...) in a var
[14:57:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2qL7ftgs/22/
[14:58:05] <taplar> the button one doesn't really matter, as you are not repeating it
[14:58:12] <robertmaxrees> still a good idea to.
[15:00:17] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/23/
[15:00:24] <sammyg> haha lol ok
[15:01:52] <sammyg> why did it work my way? if that was wrong... weird
[15:02:26] <taplar> it worked, but it didn't have the performance benefit of a single lookup
[15:03:01] <taplar> you are effectively manipulating the same thing 18 times
[15:03:05] <taplar> no need to look it up 18 times
[15:05:44] <sammyg> whoooaaa... 18 times?? wow! now i know why it seems faster now
[15:06:14] <sammyg> how to make the transitions even faster?
[15:06:19] <taplar> use css
[15:06:30] <taplar> like i showed you earlier
[15:06:37] <sammyg> css()?
[15:06:46] <taplar> no, using the css transitions
[15:07:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zyggpyzq/1/
[15:08:01] <taplar> these js animations are doing so by incrementally manipulating the dom
[15:08:13] <taplar> css transitions are handled by the browser natively
[15:12:48] <sammyg> ok let me see if i can implement this
[15:13:14] <sammyg> this is the result i was after: https://jsfiddle.net/2qL7ftgs/24/
[15:14:14] <sammyg> i wanted the image hidden from the get go, but i set opacity 0.2 to see if it displays correctly
[15:26:01] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/zyggpyzq/4/
[15:26:04] <sammyg> what am i missing?
[15:26:28] <taplar> css transitions don't queue
[15:26:33] <taplar> you'll have to write that logic
[15:28:39] <sammyg> not sure what that means
[15:28:55] <taplar> addClass/removeClass do just that
[15:29:13] <taplar> it's not giving it enough time to perform the animations before proceeding to the next state, because it doesn't wait
[15:31:26] <sammyg> css("transition", "opacity 0.15s");
[15:31:27] <sammyg> ?
[15:31:39] <taplar> no
[15:32:00] <sammyg> i tried and failed miserably :)
[15:32:10] <sammyg> https://jsfiddle.net/zyggpyzq/5/
[15:32:43] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout
[15:37:49] <sammyg> right... i think i will leave it at that for now, i have some other work to catch up on, i already have a working solution, it will have to do
[15:38:01] <sammyg> i really appreciate your help! thank you!
[15:38:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zyggpyzq/6/
[15:39:25] <sammyg> ok cool, i will save that and inspect it closely tomorrow
[15:39:29] <sammyg> thanks man! :)
[15:39:50] <taplar> inspect very closely.  i really wanted you to dig for it, but then you started to leave, :)
[15:40:24] <sammyg> haha no worries, i will, i want to learn, but like everyone else i am under time constraint so
[15:40:30] <sammyg> catch you later!
[15:40:33] <taplar> tc
[15:40:49] <taplar> robertmaxrees: you getting some rain out there, or is that still the fires i'm seeing on the doppler?
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> those are the first.
[15:41:38] <robertmaxrees> *fires
[15:41:42] <robertmaxrees> some are pretty close to me.
[15:42:15] <robertmaxrees> over 10000 firefighters across the state right now.
[15:42:23] <taplar> man
[15:42:46] <robertmaxrees> so get this:
[15:43:10] <robertmaxrees> one of the largest is the Ponderosa Fire.  Which started really close to that city with the dam that had all that trouble over winter.
[15:43:20] <robertmaxrees> that whole thing is still a cluster, too.
[15:44:08] <taplar> crazyness
[15:44:50] <taplar> you're firefighter number made us lookup the average pay for firefighters in CA
[15:44:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:45:30] <taplar> that's OT you don't want
[15:46:13] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't even get into the fact that inmates serve as firefighters, too.

[15:49:46] <taplar> that's kinda cool
[15:49:54] <taplar> $2 an hour though ...
[15:50:18] <robertmaxrees> better than most other jobs they could do.
[15:51:07] <taplar> the 2 day reduction of time is probably the bigger draw
[15:51:16] <robertmaxrees> yep./
[15:51:26] <robertmaxrees> we just don't pay firefighters enough.
[16:16:59] <poboy> what is the .in?  $(".modal-backdrop.in").hide();
[16:17:41] <robertmaxrees> a class.
[16:17:41] <taplar> what would that be in css?
[16:17:47] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[16:34:29] <jq> Is there a good way to prevent super super lag when doing a bunch of .animates at the same time
[16:34:53] <robertmaxrees> don'
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> *don't use animates
[16:35:04] <robertmaxrees> use css instead.
[16:36:06] <jq> Well I'm animating a background color, and the height and fading out all at the same time
[16:36:20] <jq> Then doing a .remove to remove from the table after the animations are done
[16:36:25] <jq> Is that CSS able?
