[00:20:42] <_genuser_> anybody around.
[00:20:54] <systemfault> No, we're all bots
[00:21:24] <_genuser_> alrighty then question if you would like to look please.
[00:21:37] <_genuser_> http://jsfiddle.net/J3wva/
[00:22:03] <_genuser_> the fiddle shows how I added the delete click event for each row. But I'd like to be able to identify each row individually.
[00:22:06] <_genuser_> any ideas?
[00:22:32] <_genuser_> preferrably query the value of URLSPAN for that row.
[00:24:22] <systemfault> Ah
[00:25:06] <systemfault> BTW.... modifying the data with a GET request is usually a recipe for disaster :P I hope it's part of an admin section
[00:25:42] <systemfault> _genuser_: Usually what I do for that case is that I add a custom "id" attribute to the top-level element of the hierarchy
[00:26:31] <systemfault> _genuser_: I'll make you an example based on what you have
[00:27:16] <_genuser_> systemfault: that's kinda what I was thinking about adding an id attribute.
[00:28:44] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/J3wva/1/
[00:29:01] <_genuser_> you dare alter my fiddle!!!
[00:29:10] <systemfault> Because i'm EVIL
[00:29:30] <systemfault> But seriously, just tell you backend dev that he's playing with fire.
[00:29:56] <systemfault> Having any kind of side-effect on the server with a GET request is beyond retarded.
[00:30:01] <ravenzz> it is nice to join and read those kind of messages
[00:30:01] <_genuser_> systemfault: oooh, that's what I was wanting to do. I was thinking about the data-profile-id stuff.
[00:30:29] <_genuser_> systemfault: oh you mean GET method to delete ID = playing with fire?
[00:30:37] <_genuser_> I mean is that what you're referring to?
[00:30:46] <systemfault> _genuser_: In this case, yes
[00:31:09] <_genuser_> oh, I see. well I'm the back end dev. lol.
[00:31:21] <systemfault> GET  = read, POST = write
[00:31:43] <systemfault> (That's if you're not using the other HTTP verbs)
[00:31:45] <_genuser_> It's a simple small app for a simple function. But I see what you're saying, I agree GETs are dangerous.
[00:32:32] <_genuser_> but still, even with posts you can easily lose data if you're not authenticating your users or validating the request, no?
[00:32:52] <koneko> GETs aren't dangerous, it's just not what they're used for
[00:34:03] <_genuser_> I've used GETs for cmd=<command> to run my controller for a while.
[00:34:19] <slax0r> GET is not dangerous
[00:34:21] <systemfault> GET used for writes is dangerous. GET itself is fine.
[00:34:25] <slax0r> printing out int ids is
[00:34:33] <systemfault> Who said that GET is dangerous anyway?
[00:34:43] <slax0r> how is GET any more dangerous than POST?
[00:34:49] <_genuser_> and then it gets easier to send an id right there and just delete it there
[00:35:12] <_genuser_> the id's won't be printed on screen. just used in data-profile-id...
[00:35:23] <slax0r> it doesn't matter
[00:35:33] <slax0r> and ID can be quickly changed in the request
[00:35:46] <slax0r> if you're using uuids then it's a bit trickier
[00:35:49] <mepl> $('#cb-table').prepend(data); how can I make it prepend BEFORE the <thead> tag?
[00:35:56] <mepl> AFTER*
[00:35:57] <mepl> my bad
[00:35:57] <slax0r> and you have to make sure deletes are checked against permissions first
[00:36:16] <systemfault> mepl: $('#cb-table thead').prepend(data) ?
[00:36:18] <_genuser_> slax0r: well, if you're not passing id's how do you identify what to delete?
[00:36:33] <slax0r> _genuser_: uuids
[00:36:42] <slax0r> or random uuids used just for that one request
[00:37:06] <_genuser_> slax0r: so for each dbid, you create a uuid which is passed to the browser?
[00:37:14] <koneko> mepl, $('#cb-table thead').after(data);
[00:37:33] <koneko> .prepend inserts it inside of the matched element
[00:37:35] <mepl> yes, excellent thank you
[00:37:37] <slax0r> a user requests a page with a list of items, for each item a random unique number is generated, and store that to the users session, then a user sends that random number to be deleted, and you check to which id is this random number associated
[00:37:41] <slax0r> check permissions
[00:37:41] <slax0r> and delete
[00:37:48] <slax0r> and no matter what you use, GET or POST
[00:38:18] <slax0r> and ofcourse the session is then cleared of those random numbers
[00:38:32] <_genuser_> slax0r: makes sense. so this session you speak of. web server sessions?
[00:38:49] <slax0r> yes, php session in example
[00:39:08] <_genuser_> for this application I don't care much for security. But in general if I'm writing an outward facing application, I want to know. :)
[00:39:14] <slax0r> you can store it anywhere, as long as you can check it later
[00:39:26] <slax0r> never ignore security..
[00:39:58] <systemfault> Just use UUIDs for your entities.... and use the proper HTTP verbs.
[00:40:13] <systemfault> So you don't need to do any temp UUID bullshit.
[00:40:16] <_genuser_> systemfault: but as we just discovered, I need to create UUIDs.
[00:40:51] <slax0r> uuids would be enough, but if you're supper paranoid, go for temps...
[00:41:07] <slax0r> super*
[00:41:08] <systemfault> _genuser_: I thought you already had autoincrement ids for your profiles
[00:41:31] <_genuser_> systemfault: yeah, dbid's auto incremented.
[00:42:05] <_genuser_> interesting stuff. I am not web dev mainly so I haven't focused much on production apps and security features that much before. just basic validatoin.
[00:42:32] <_genuser_> so I'm hearing very useful ideas and that's helpful in making an applciation secure.
[00:43:00] <slax0r> I suggest you read a few well written documents on web security
[00:44:29] <_genuser_> yeah, that or move up to management.
[00:44:30] <koneko> Isn't it easier to authorize the delete request from the PHP script and return an error? The only thing these random UUIDs accomplish from what I can tell is hide the real ID from the HTML.
[00:44:30] <_genuser_> lol
[00:45:31] <slax0r> koneko: true, but what if you have a bug in your authorization code and someone is guessing IDs randomly?
[00:45:55] <_genuser_> I like idea of learnign to implement UUIDs, etc.
[00:45:57] <slax0r> or you haven't updated your code in a while and a php update i.e. breaks your authorization and again the above?
[00:46:09] <_genuser_> but my app is actually no authentication/authorization atm.
[00:46:13] <koneko> There's a small but existing possibility that somebody guesses the UUIDs anyway
[00:46:36] <systemfault> _genuser_: Then for some reason... something crawls your website.... it will delete all your data?
[00:46:52] <koneko> Replacing one IDs by other IDs is just obscuring data, not security
[00:46:53] <systemfault> Because it's going to trigger all your links
[00:47:13] <_genuser_> systemfault: now, that's a very interesting question you ask.
[00:47:51] <_genuser_> mainly it's meant to be used by crypto currency miners. inside their network and not exposed outside. but if a person exposes it to the world, all sorts of security issues come into the picture.
[00:47:54] <koneko> It's quite easy to just make a script that will go through all random UUID combinations it can imagine quite fast and wipe the data.
[00:48:00] <systemfault> lol
[00:48:01] <systemfault> hahaha
[00:48:13] <systemfault> Educate yourself about UUIDs.
[00:48:32] <_genuser_> I thougth you were lol'ing about my "inside the network" part.
[00:48:37] <_genuser_> I was thinking ok it wasn't that funny.
[00:48:48] <systemfault> No, the "through all random UUID combinations" was laughable
[00:49:16] <koneko> Well, not all, I agree
[00:49:39] <koneko> But still, you could by chance hit some of them, that's no security at all
[00:50:04] <koneko> UUIDs aren't meant for security, just for identifying
[00:50:26] <systemfault> Yes... so good luck getting UUIDs that already exist.
[00:50:30] <koneko> But I guess you're educated enough about them to know that
[00:50:57] <systemfault> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Random_UUID_probability_of_duplicates
[00:50:58] <_genuser_> the UUID or GUID is not really easy to guess. I don't think you'll get a hit very easily, IF at all.
[00:51:23] <systemfault> To put these numbers into perspective, the annual risk of someone being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion,[38] which means the probability is about 0.00000000006 (6 × 10−11), equivalent to the odds of creating a few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a year and having one duplicate. In other words, only after generating 1 billion UUIDs every second for the next 100 years, the probability of creating just one
[00:51:24] <systemfault> duplicate would be about 50%. Or, to put it another way, the probability of one duplicate would be about 50% if every person on earth owns 600 million UUIDs.
[00:52:00] <koneko> Yes, that wasn't too smart, but the fact they're not meant for security measures stands
[00:52:04] <_genuser_> that's just crazy.
[00:52:14] <_genuser_> how would you store all your 600 million UUIDs.
[00:52:27] <_genuser_> wait, I'll make a web application for you guys.. ID's passed in GET of course....
[00:52:42] <_genuser_> :p
[00:53:33] <_genuser_> systemfault: so back to the authorization bit, would crawler hit the POST urls too?
[00:53:50] <_genuser_> systemfault: and I suppose I need to add a generic username and a user assignable password.
[00:54:06] <systemfault> _genuser_: Usually, they don't... but also.... usually any deletion happens in a protected admin section of a website
[00:54:45] <_genuser_> you've just prolonged my web development lol.
[00:54:50] <systemfault> Also... using GET vs POST is about using HTTP properly.
[00:55:00] <_genuser_> I'm going to have to implement authorization for deletes AND inserts.
[00:55:16] <systemfault> GET requests should be nullipotent
[00:55:26] <systemfault> POST can have side-effects.
[00:56:29] <systemfault> Well... nobody is ever done learning web development... get used to it
[00:56:56] <_genuser_> so to turn my "delete" links into posts. what's the proper method then?
[00:57:15] <_genuser_> use forms for each link? use a big form encompassing all links? use jquery $.post() ?
[00:57:50] <koneko> $.post() should work fine
[00:58:02] <_genuser_> I suppose a confirm() and $.post() for each link would easy and fast.
[00:58:04] <systemfault> The classic non-js way is to create form with a hidden field + submit button for every id.
[00:58:12] <systemfault> But with JS, you can make it a lot simpler.
[00:58:48] <_genuser_> yeah, which is what I'm seeing about jquery. stuff can be done in one line that would take use many many lines to do without jquery
[01:00:07] <systemfault> It's all feasible using JS + DOM... jQuery just makes it a bit easier and provide normalization so it works on all browsers
[01:01:37] <_genuser_> understood. the benefit of others' work of making it multi-browser  platform is truly appreciated with frameworks like this.
[01:03:11] <mepl> how many ajax posts can you make a second with jquery before things start going sour you believe? A simple ajax script that calls a php function which retrieves the amount of rows in a db table.
[01:04:10] <mepl> 10, 20, 50 or 100?
[01:04:12] <systemfault> mepl: These days, browsers have a limit of 6 requests per domain at a time.
[01:04:37] <mepl> what does that mean really, 6 per second?
[01:04:45] <systemfault> No, no, no..
[01:04:47] <mepl> how many request can the browser do a second
[01:04:58] <systemfault> It depends on the PHP server.
[01:05:02] <mepl> should I be able to do 5 ajax posts each second without having to worry?
[01:05:07] <systemfault> Yeahhhhh, sure
[01:05:50] <systemfault> You should try to do as few as possible... but 5 won't cause any problem
[01:06:11] <mepl> am gonna go with one every second instead, the output in firebug scares me
[01:06:36] <systemfault> You know... people pretty much never need "realtime"
[01:06:55] <mepl> realtime makes the page feel active
[01:07:00] <mepl> adding these timers will make it sluggish
[01:07:08] <systemfault> Not really... as the users doesn't know.
[01:07:29] <systemfault> So, if you refresh every 5 seconds instead of at every second, the user might not even notice.
[01:07:44] <systemfault> But in any case, one XHR per second is far from being a problem
[01:07:48] <mepl> yeah they will, they trigger the refresh by removing a entry from a table
[01:08:16] <mepl> no wait my bad. They remove entries from a table, I refresh and get the table rows every second.
[01:08:21] <mepl> If I did that every 5 they would notice
[01:09:10] <systemfault> mepl: You could remove the entries from the DOM just after sending the DELETE command :P
[01:09:30] <mepl> not the table counter
[01:09:36] <mepl> and it must work on different platforms at the same time
[01:10:17] <systemfault> Ah ok, just guessing since I don't have all the details... but seriously, don't worry about polling every second for the client(It's probably a lot more heavy on the backend)
[01:16:06] <_genuser_> that's what I was thinking of doing after a $.post(). just delete the div from teh DOM instead of loading the page again.
[01:20:11] <Kira> Do events generally work with (elements inside) svg elements?
[01:22:57] <Cork> Kira: yes
[01:23:27] <Kira> And they bubble correctly?
[01:23:51] <Cork> yes
[01:24:35] <mepl> how can I change the div content where tr id = 5? http://jsfiddle.net/2FK4r/
[01:24:43] <mepl> foreach tr if id = 5?
[01:24:45] <mepl> Sounds messy
[01:25:02] <Kira> I hear there is some problem with mouseenter and mouseleave?
[01:25:36] <Cork> mepl: $('#5')
[01:26:58] <mepl> Cork, #5 is not static
[01:27:03] <mepl> I will have other id's
[01:27:09] <Cork> uh
[01:27:16] <mepl> id will be supplied through a var
[01:27:20] <mepl> can be any tr id on the page
[01:27:21] <Cork> "div content where tr id = 5"
[01:27:38] <mepl> well I need something universal. Id can be anything from 1 to 100
[01:27:51] <Kira> $('#'+id)
[01:27:51] <Kira> ?
[01:27:53] <Cork> so you want to find anything with an id?
[02:20:10] <user258467> Hi, I would like to know how do I select a li which contains(text(), 'foo') in xpath it is one query but with jquery selectors do I need to iterate over li?
[02:21:27] <seutje> $('li:contains("foo")')
[02:21:42] <user258467> seutje, thanks!
[02:24:39] <Cork> that is still an iteration though
[02:24:41] <Cork> just hidden
[02:32:25] <krambiorix> hi, i have a string like 'this is a string'   -> i want to get the substring after the first occurence of a whitespace , so this would be 'is  a string' ... How can i do that?
[02:35:12] <Cork> js> print('this is a string'.split(' ').splice(1).join(' '))
[02:35:19] <b-ot> Cork: is a string
[02:36:00] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot!
[02:36:11] <Cork> or you can use indexOf
[02:36:17] <Cork> and the substr if you prefer that
[02:36:53] <Cork> js> var str = 'this is a string'; print(str.substr(str.indexOf(' ')))
[02:36:59] <b-ot> Cork:  is a string
[02:37:04] <Cork> js> var str = 'this is a string'; print(str.substr(str.indexOf(' ') + 1))
[02:37:08] <b-ot> Cork: is a string
[02:37:23] <Cork> the last one is a bit more generic
[02:43:38] <krambiorix> Ok Cork thanks again
[02:44:34] <krambiorix> i bind a click event on a select box. So i only want the event to fire when the user clicks on the select box... Not when the user selects a value from the box... Is this possible?
[02:50:22] <seutje> krambiorix: match this and e.target to exclude children
[02:52:57] <krambiorix> seutje, great idea , thanks
[02:54:03] <seutje> krambiorix: hmz, doesn't work with click, as the mouseup isn't fired on the select, bind to mousedown instead
[02:54:35] <seutje> see http://jsfiddle.net/6YTCz/
[03:17:20] <_genuser_> so what is the difference between   $(function() {     $( "#dialog-confirm" ).dialog({ ])        });
[03:17:34] <_genuser_> and  $( "#dialog-confirm" ).dialog({ ]);
[03:17:56] <Cork> _genuser_: the first one waits for the dom to be parsed
[03:17:59] <Cork> the second just runs
[03:18:05] <xec> ignoring the {] syntax error
[03:18:07] <xec> ;)
[03:18:16] <_genuser_> :)
[03:18:21] <Cork> $(function() {}) is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {})
[03:18:46] <Cork> and that in turn is basically $(document).on('DOMContentLoaded', function() {})
[03:18:53] <_genuser_> Cork: so if you're referencing items that may not be created yet, you wanna use $(fnciton(){... format.
[03:19:03] <_genuser_> otherwise, just go direct access, correct?
[03:19:13] <Cork> _genuser_: ify ou use elements from the page and your code isn't running at the end of the page
[03:19:17] <Cork> you need ready
[03:19:36] <Cork> basically $( "#dialog-confirm" ) in <head> won't match anything
[03:19:42] <Cork> cause body is empty
[03:20:08] <_genuser_> I see. I have after hearing others here put all my jquery stuff right before the </body>
[03:20:25] <Cork> _genuser_: that makes the code load async
[03:20:37] <Cork> and as the body has been parsed when you get there
[03:20:50] <Cork> you don't need to use the event listener (actually some browsers will break if you do)
[03:21:30] <_genuser_> event listener being the $(function(){}); one, correct?
[03:22:27] <Cork> yes
[03:22:44] <Cork> the first two of the examples i gave is identical
[03:23:01] <Cork> the last is a little less and will definitely break if you have it at the end of body
[03:23:26] <_genuser_> I see.
[03:23:50] <_genuser_> I'm split between using JS confirm() and using jquery dialogs.
[03:24:15] <_genuser_> the dialogs need lot of work to just get them to look like the rest of the application. however, I like their look and feel more.
[03:25:48] <Deele> I have form with two submit buttons, but with different names and values. When I trigger click event on any of those submit buttons, it submits form with first submit button name and value, even if click was triggered on any other submit button. Why is it so?
[03:28:23] <Cork> Deele: js doesn't really support having multiple submit buttons
[03:28:42] <Cork> Deele: it is the browser not really a jquery thing
[03:29:47] <_genuser_> guess your best bet is to change them both to button and hit form.submit on click for both.
[03:30:03] <Deele> and use hidden field...
[03:30:22] <Cork> bets is prob to set a hidden value on click
[03:30:35] <Cork> and just let the normal submit handle that
[03:30:46] <Cork> and don't use any value on the button it selfs
[04:16:50] <mazzachre> I have an issue with "focus" events on Mac and in IE9 (Apparently, Investegating that, since it is only one customer that seems to have the problem) A simple test is here: http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/yQe5h/2/ If it works, it should write a lot of events out, "focusin", "focus", "click" when the button is cliked... On Mac OS X it only writes "click" and nothing when the button is no longer in focus...
[04:18:34] <edulix_> hi people
[04:19:56] <edulix> so when I click a link to #someHash, it by default scrolls to that link, and changes the url to #someHash, right?
[04:20:12] <edulix> how can I prevent the scrolling but preserving the url hashing?
[04:22:25] <mazzachre> edulix: You can just manipulate the window.location object instead of having a link...
[04:27:13] <mazzachre> Any ideas about the "focus" events?
[04:30:39] <ghostlines> hi, why isn't it required to trigger all javascript for it to run. For instance if I just define an anonymous function within a script tag it runs automatically
[04:30:41] <xec> edulix: you can't. not easily anyway. I guess you could hack your way around it by removing the ID from the element matching the hash (and then put it back after)
[04:31:20] <edulix> xec: I just used history.pushState and if your browser doesn't support it so  be it
[04:45:57] <ZeuZ> is it possible to track a download from my own site with plain JS or jQuery? Like, to have a download meter that updates each time it receives data, then use blobbuilder or such to create a file download from a variable? I know the last can be done. I implemented it before with ajax inside a for, with a custom script in PHP that sent first the number of 100kb chunks, but the browser did lock up
[04:50:27] <xec> ZeuZ: i don't think that's something jquery can help you with, you can probably get more useful help in ##javascript
[04:57:46] <ZeuZ> xec, thanks

[05:21:08] <Neon> Okay, I'm actually trying to use jQuery mobile on a mobile device (Android Gingerbread) and it's unusable, because jquery.mobile-1.4.1 has syntax errors and, further, DOM errors. E.g. my mobile browser complains about default being used as literal filed name (foo.default instead of foo['default']).
[05:21:45] <eugenmayer> Hello. How would get the style width property with jquery. i dont mean the width the dom element has but rather the value as a style. Basically i need to detect if a absolute width value is set on the element or not
[05:21:50] <Neon> Am I doing something wrong or is jQuery-mobile just not built for mobile usage?
[05:22:06] <eugenmayer> tried .css('width') but this returns the dom width, same as .width()
[05:22:31] <Cork> eugenmayer: so you want the width value for the css rule not the element?
[05:22:58] <Cork> and yes css() will return the computed value
[05:23:09] <eugenmayer> Cork the other way arround, i want the concrete CSS value, not the dom-width value the element is rendered width
[05:23:27] <Cork> eugenmayer: the problem is if you want css values; from where?
[05:23:51] <Cork> the css value sat directly on the element (and nothing if it isn't sat there) the values from a specific rule
[05:23:54] <Cork> the winning rule?
[05:23:56] <Cork> or what?
[05:24:09] <Cork> there isn't just one width value that can exist on an element
[05:24:19] <Cork> and computed is the way to find the winning value
[05:24:26] <eugenmayer> Cork: in this particula case its even an element style ( there are no css rules affecting it )
[05:24:38] <Cork> eugenmayer: .attr('style')
[05:24:43] <Cork> and parse the width from the string
[05:24:49] <Cork> is prob the way to do it
[05:24:52] <eugenmayer> hmm, no this would actually give me the property, or?
[05:25:02] <Cork> no
[05:25:07] <Cork> attr is getAttribute
[05:25:11] <Cork> it will give you the string
[05:25:28] <eugenmayer> <div width="200px">   <- this is were .attr('width') returns 200px or?
[05:25:37] <Cork> yes
[05:25:43] <eugenmayer> (iam looking for <div style="width:200px"
[05:25:48] <Cork> i didn't say attr('width') though
[05:25:52] <Cork> i said attr('style')
[05:25:57] <eugenmayer> ah!
[05:26:02] <eugenmayer> and then parse it manually?
[05:26:06] <Cork> ya
[05:26:07] <krambiorix> i fill up this cached object and want to send it with ajax...in Firebug in the parameter tab i see that jquery only sends boekjaarid and not the array rekeningen.... What can i do?
[05:26:10] <krambiorix> http://pastebin.com/hAsw6LFz
[05:26:19] <eugenmayer> Cork: no easier way in this case i guess?
[05:26:26] <Cork> eugenmayer: you could check what prop('style').width gives you
[05:26:35] <seutje> why not [0].style.width ? if it's on the style attr, it'll take precedence anyway, no?
[05:26:47] <eugenmayer> Cork: is this 2.x jquery ?
[05:26:47] <Cork> but i'm not sure if that will be the exact same value you set in the style attribute
[05:26:52] <Cork> eugenmayer: no
[05:26:59] <Cork> eugenmayer: 2.x and 1.9+ is the same thing
[05:27:04] <Cork> just different browser support
[05:27:25] <eugenmayer> seutje: so you go the vanillaJS way in this case?
[05:27:40] <Cork> eugenmayer: prop('style') is the same thing as [0].style
[05:27:49] <seutje> I just hate parsing strings
[05:27:52] <Cork> just different ways to express it
[05:28:01] <eugenmayer> seutje: me either :)
[05:28:08] <Cork> seutje: you don't really parse it though
[05:28:24] <Cork> [0]['style'] === [0].style
[05:28:38] <seutje> I guess it would fail in the onload attribute was changed through the style prop
[05:28:56] <seutje> s/in/if
[05:29:12] <seutje> but hang on, why are you trying to get at it?
[05:29:38] <eugenmayer> .style.width …. works awesome!. Does any x-browser issues exists? ( iam ie8+ ..)
[05:30:17] <seutje> yeah, that's why you might wanna use .prop('style')
[05:30:23] <eugenmayer> seutje: why is very complicated…its about td sizes when you print with apacheFOP ( fop can calculate optimal sizes, but browsers do, so i have to save the browser rendered value)
[05:30:39] <seutje> ok nv, I'm sorry I asked :P
[05:30:43] <seutje> nvm*
[05:31:06] <seutje> but if u want rendered width, .width() is probably more reliable
[05:31:22] <Cork> ya
[05:31:32] <Cork> style.width isn't rendering dependent at all
[05:31:43] <seutje> the other is just what CSS is trying to make it look
[05:31:43] <eugenmayer> no, i need an execption if the width is set absolutely already, i dont want to recompute - so i need the "cancel calucalation" exception case
[05:31:47] <Cork> but that was the original start of the question though
[05:31:59] <eugenmayer> i dont use that width value for computing, thats clear. Just for the check
[05:32:08] <seutje> ooh
[05:32:14] <seutje> just wanna check presence
[05:32:29] <eugenmayer>       if(parseInt($el.prop('style').width,10) > 0)
[05:32:29] <eugenmayer>         return
[05:32:35] <Cork> eugenmayer: a nice way might be to use min-width/max-width instead
[05:32:55] <eugenmayer> Cork: not getting your idea, could you explain? ( sorry )
[05:33:12] <Cork> firstly max-width and min-width is never rendering dependent
[05:33:16] <Cork> so it is always the value you sat
[05:33:31] <Cork> it also means you can leave wiggle room if you want
[05:33:54] <eugenmayer> i have to really set "width" for fop. Fop does not understand auto, nor min or max
[05:34:10] <Cork> fop?
[05:34:15] <eugenmayer> ApacheFOP
[05:34:18] <Cork> ah
[05:34:28] <krambiorix> anyone ? i fill up this cached object ($("body").data()  ) and want to send it with ajax...in Firebug in the parameter tab i see that jquery only sends boekjaarid and not the array rekeningen.... What can i do?  http://pastebin.com/hAsw6LFz
[05:34:51] <eugenmayer> i didnt want to go to detailed here Cork seutje since this would become offtopic then :) You helped me _a lot_ !
[05:35:03] <eugenmayer> thank you
[05:35:03] <Cork> krambiorix: do you have anything not json parsable in the data object?
[05:35:34] <seutje> eugenmayer: it just helps to know the goal, rather than a problem in a particular approach
[05:37:23] <krambiorix> Cork, no idea :s
[05:37:47] <Cork> krambiorix: then you need to make sure before you can even try sending it over ajax
[05:38:07] <Cork> krambiorix: it has to be serializable to text else you can't send it
[05:38:15] <Cork> (so ex dom element references won't work)
[05:38:16] <seutje> krambiorix: that row variable is instanciated as an array, but used like an object
[05:38:27] <seutje> not sure if that's the issue, but it won't help
[05:38:40] <Cork> oh, missed the link >_>
[05:39:03] <Cork> krambiorix: you might want to shorten the lines that was 5 lines wrapped here
[05:39:15] <Cork> becomes very easy to miss parts when it is that long
[05:39:23] <krambiorix> seutje, it wasn't :s
[05:39:54] <seutje> don't rly see where you are serializing, or even trying to post it
[05:39:55] <eugenmayer> seutje: to be honest, i really disagree in IRC. to many people e.g. in my case would rather start a flame war instead of answering
[05:40:02] <Cork> krambiorix: fixed it in both places?
[05:40:13] <eugenmayer> seutje: just like "use width…this is the way you get the value, dont hack your way using style" etc.
[05:40:21] <krambiorix> seutje, the posting is just data: $("body").data("boekingen");
[05:40:22] <seutje> eugenmayer: true, but sometimes, the approach is just wrong :P
[05:40:40] <krambiorix> Cork, both places?
[05:40:58] <Cork> krambiorix: line 15 and line 9
[05:41:02] <Cork> and line 3
[05:41:56] <zumba_addict> morning folks. I'm using i18next library. I'm wondering why when I move the i18n.init function inside .success of ajax, i18n becomes unknown method
[05:41:58] <Cork> krambiorix: also shouldn't line 8-10 be before line 1?
[05:42:03] <eugenmayer> seutje: yeah, but generally in IRC i dont teach people approaches if they dont ask for it, because i dont know their particuar case. Mainly this "tell me your goal" or "i dont answer this stupid question" tends to be more "cockyness" then anything else. Like "i know better what is good for you" - i dont like to be teaching that way, because this suggests the asking person is stupid :)
[05:42:15] <eugenmayer> seutje: i get your point though, dont get me wrong.
[05:42:19] <krambiorix> Cork, solved those lines but still problem
[05:42:37] <Cork> krambiorix: then provide the info seutje asked for
[05:42:44] <Cork> the part where you try to send it is missing

[05:45:24] <krambiorix> sorry!
[05:45:26] <krambiorix> i know
[05:45:28] <krambiorix> so sorry
[05:45:31] <krambiorix> http://pastebin.com/yWWxCURc
[05:45:32] <krambiorix> seutje, i pasted in the wrong window
[05:45:33] <seutje> it's just $.jax()
[05:45:44] <eugenmayer> LD
[05:45:51] <seutje> most clients guard against that and throw a warning/dialog for it
[05:46:02] <eugenmayer> krambiorix: next time just /part and come back  :)
[05:46:14] <cannap> wtf
[05:46:27] <krambiorix> okok
[05:46:35] <Cork> krambiorix: add a console.log() with data before the ajax call
[05:46:38] <Cork> and check what you have there
[05:46:47] <krambiorix> Cork, yes i did
[05:46:49] <eugenmayer> krambiorix: happens the best :)
[05:46:53] <krambiorix> Cork, looks fine
[05:46:57] <krambiorix> eugenmayer, thx :)
[05:47:01] <Cork> wait a min
[05:47:14] <Cork> krambiorix: do you want to send params or json?
[05:47:17] <eugenmayer> Just in case, is there a promise-based implementation for jquery? so ajax().then ( RSVP )?
[05:47:26] <Cork> eugenmayer: yes
[05:47:26] <seutje> yup
[05:47:31] <Cork> ?api then
[05:47:31] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[05:47:38] <Cork> ?api jQuery.then
[05:47:38] <seutje> `api $.when
[05:47:38] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[05:47:41] <seutje> lol
[05:47:43] <b-ot> seutje: No matches.
[05:47:50] <Cork> ?api jQuery.when
[05:47:50] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.when(): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred</a> objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[05:47:56] <krambiorix> Cork, doesn't matter
[05:47:56] <seutje> b-ot: Y U NO?
[05:47:56] <b-ot> seutje: it is decidedly so.
[05:48:17] <Cork> krambiorix: well it matters in what structure you expect to send
[05:48:41] <Cork> krambiorix: right now you give a multi level nested object to jquery and expects it to convert it to params
[05:48:46] <krambiorix> Cork, json
[05:48:47] <Cork> and it might be problematic
[05:48:52] <Cork> you arn't sending json
[05:49:06] <krambiorix> Cork, ?
[05:49:19] <Cork> data.bokekingen = JSON.serialize($('body').data('boekingen'));
[05:49:21] <seutje> it's an object, gotsa stringify
[05:49:28] <Cork> damn
[05:49:34] <seutje> oh, it's serialize?
[05:49:34] <Cork> right JSON uses strignify for ....
[05:49:37] <Cork> *gah*
[05:49:38] <Cork> no
[05:49:45] <seutje> nah, that would make sense :P
[05:49:51] <seutje> gotta have silly names for common methods
[05:49:55] <Cork> i ALWAYS call it wrong cause most other system use serialize
[05:50:04] <seutje> it really should be serialize
[05:50:05] <Cork> well not always
[05:50:07] <Cork> but often
[05:50:10] <Cork> ya
[05:50:15] <Cork> blame json.js
[05:50:20] <Cork> he made up the names
[05:50:22] <maxer> is possible to push a redirect to the browser when my ajax request returns a 301 redirect?
[05:50:24] <seutje> why not JSON.objectify instead of parse?
[05:50:48] <seutje> guess people don't wanna be objective :P
[05:51:30] <eugenmayer> Cork: so jquerys.when is RSVPs .then?
[05:51:33] <krambiorix> Cork,  JSON.serialize is not a function
[05:51:36] <Cork> JSON.serialize = JSON.stringify;JSON.objectify = JSON.parse;
[05:51:40] <Cork> much better :)
[05:51:54] <Cork> krambiorix: see seutjes comment
[05:52:13] <seutje> krambiorix: why async: false ? :(
[05:52:35] <eugenmayer> Cork: but its not a promise at all, looking at the interface. But its the same purpose, just different implementation. My questions is, is there a "wrapper" for it to make a promise object ( decorated )
[05:52:39] <Cork> eugenmayer: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise
[05:52:45] <Cork> eugenmayer: it is
[05:52:45] <eugenmayer> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[05:52:46] <eugenmayer> ah!
[05:52:57] <eugenmayer> my bad, just overlooked at. Stupid me.
[05:52:58] <Cork> eugenmayer: it is just part of it
[05:53:09] <seutje> ye olde Wham! Bam!
[05:53:11] <eugenmayer> Awesome to know.
[05:53:21] <krambiorix> Cork, i don't understand serialize (without JSON. ) doesn't work too
[05:53:34] <Cork> krambiorix: JSON.stringify as seutje said
[05:53:45] <seutje> krambiorix: serialize if for form data -> querystring
[05:53:49] <Cork> i used the logical name, instead of the real one...
[05:53:51] <seutje> (mainly)
[05:53:56] <Cork> ya
[05:54:00] <seutje> and I mean $.fn.serialize
[05:54:42] <krambiorix> k
[05:55:36] <Cork> ugg interleaved multi process logs
[05:55:41] <Cork> fun times...
[05:55:59] <krambiorix> Cork, seutje when i use stringify , in my post data i get a string "[]" for boekingen
[05:56:22] <Cork> krambiorix: then those datas most likely isn't something you can send over the net
[05:56:32] <Cork> cause it is function references, and dom element references
[05:57:21] <krambiorix> Cork, if i make everything an array? Would that be easier?
[05:57:32] <Cork> no
[05:57:53] <Cork> what you need is { key: value } { key: [arr] }
[05:58:04] <Cork> and the values can only be strings, bool or number
[05:58:14] <Cork> every thing else needs to be converted to one of those things
[05:58:14] <krambiorix> Cork, but that's what i have
[05:58:31] <Cork> krambiorix: you fail on the last part
[05:59:21] <krambiorix> Cork, ok but stringify doesn't do it
[05:59:29] <seutje> can you put a console.log(data.boekingen.length) right before the ajax call and see if it reports anything other than 0?
[06:00:38] <krambiorix> seutje, 0
[06:00:43] <seutje> there you go
[06:00:50] <seutje> empty array is empty
[06:01:45] <Cork> krambiorix: note though an array doesn't have keys
[06:02:02] <Cork> krambiorix: so this might be an effect of you thinking of php arrays
[06:02:09] <Cork> as that isn't how arrays works
[06:02:15] <krambiorix> Cork, associative arrays...
[06:02:23] <Cork> krambiorix: doesn't exist in js
[06:02:26] <Cork> those are objects
[06:02:29] <Cork> not arrays
[06:02:34] <krambiorix> aaah
[06:03:04] <Cork> if you want to make an array you do as you do in one of the cases in the earlier code .push()
[06:03:26] <Cork> and then it will generate a continuous array
[06:03:28] <seutje> can you even use the data('foo') return as a reference?
[06:03:37] <Cork> ja
[06:03:39] <Cork> *ya
[06:03:50] <Cork> i often dump all kind of junk in there :)
[06:04:18] <krambiorix> Cork, but i use: $("body").data('boekingen')[curid]['rekeningen'].push(row)
[06:04:18] <Cork> $('#template').data('parsed', $('#template').tmpl())
[06:04:31] <krambiorix> What can i do to solve this thing then?
[06:04:40] <seutje> $('.foo').data('bar') = [] gives  me a reference error though
[06:05:16] <Cork> $("body").data('boekingen') = {}; $("body").data('boekingen')[curid] = { 'rekeningen': [row] };
[06:05:26] <Cork> seutje: only if bar doesn't exist
[06:05:40] <seutje> that's exactly what he does though
[06:05:44] <Cork> $('.foo').data('bar', {}); $('.foo').data('bar').key = true
[06:05:52] <seutje> line 8
[06:06:00] <seutje> $("body").data('boekingen') = [];
[06:06:13] <Cork> ah
[06:06:15] <seutje> does that not throw an error for you?
[06:06:16] <Cork> ya that won't work
[06:06:21] <Cork> it should
[06:06:44] <Cork> you would not create a connection to the object holding the value for data()
[06:06:51] <Cork> so ya that isn't possible
[06:07:25] <krambiorix> i do $("body").data('boekingen')[curid] = {};
[06:07:39] <seutje> change $("body").data('boekingen') = []; to $("body").data('boekingen', []);
[06:07:55] <seutje> oh no wait, ur using that as an object
[06:07:56] <Cork> no {})
[06:08:03] <Cork> it isn't an array
[06:08:06] <seutje> yeah, {} instead
[06:08:13] <seutje> such confuse
[06:08:23] <seutje> much confuzzle
[06:09:18] <krambiorix> seutje, Cork , hmmm nope doesn't work
[06:10:18] <krambiorix> seutje, Cork this is what i have now : http://pastebin.com/zLvhULnK
[06:10:21] <seutje> I'm so confused...
[06:10:31] <seutje> $("body").data('boekingen')[curid] = []; ... lil further ... $("body").data('boekingen')[curid]['rekeningen'].push(row);
[06:10:38] <seutje> so that isn't an array either
[06:11:02] <seutje> oh ok, so that's an actual object now
[06:11:28] <Cork> krambiorix: might be good to make a new pb with the updated code
[06:11:33] <seutje> lol shit, now boekingen isn't an array, so length won't work
[06:11:37] <Cork> else we'r talking about code from the past
[06:11:48] <Cork> oh there is one
[06:11:50] <seutje> he just pasted an updated one
[06:12:20] <Cork> ya i saw
[06:12:44] <Cork> krambiorix: side note $.map() is nice a alternative instead of .push in an each loop
[06:12:56] <Cork> it doesn't really matter but the code gets nicer
[06:13:09] <krambiorix> Cork, i'll keep it in mind
[06:13:17] <seutje> krambiorix: if($(this).children(":selected").attr("id") == ''){ <- when this fails, you don't actually add the object
[06:13:52] <Cork> heh
[06:14:00] <seutje> if it succeeds (line 8) you go $("body").data('boekingen')[curid] = {};, but if it fails, you assume the object already exists?
[06:14:17] <seutje> also
[06:15:00] <krambiorix> seutje, if it fails, it shouldn't do anything
[06:15:20] <seutje> you grab the ID and use it though
[06:15:34] <seutje> there's stuff happening beyond that else
[06:15:53] <Cork> else { return; } ?
[06:16:23] <krambiorix> Cork, added thta
[06:16:36] <Helo_dont_mes_wi> Test!
[06:18:17] <Helo_dont_mes_wi> testing testing
[06:18:52] <Cork> Helo_dont_mes_wi: please do that in a private channel
[06:18:59] <Cork> and not one with 700+ users
[06:19:05] <krambiorix> Cork, seutje added that but still doesn't work
[06:19:24] <Helo_dont_mes_wi> cork, ok cool
[06:19:35] <MariusIT> hi, how can I oneshot this target http://jsfiddle.net/YuENG/ ?
[06:19:50] <Cork> oneshot?
[06:20:12] <MariusIT> yes, get the triggeing class in one line
[06:20:48] <eugenmayer> Cork: oneshot is when you dont need 2 shots.
[06:20:51] <Cork> MariusIT: you arn't even using the first line for the second line
[06:21:14] <eugenmayer> Yeah and the second line is a "oneshot" already
[06:21:48] <krambiorix> seutje, any other suggestions?
[06:21:59] <MariusIT> is there a better way to find out what's the trigger?
[06:22:17] <Helo_dont_mes_wi> bye all, have a great weekend! :)
[06:22:26] <MariusIT> u2 mate
[06:22:28] <Cork> MariusIT: what are you trying to do?
[06:22:42] <eugenmayer> Cork: finding the trigger for the oneshot! :)
[06:22:48] <eugenmayer> (sorry, i had to be sarcastic)
[06:23:02] <Cork> what's wrong with "this"?
[06:23:37] <Cork> MariusIT: it's almost impossible to give a good answer as there is no context what so ever with the question
[06:23:47] <Cork> MariusIT: hack the question isn't even complete
[06:23:53] <MariusIT> Cork: this http://jsfiddle.net/YuENG/1/
[06:23:57] <Cork> as you arn't saying what you mean by "identify"
[06:24:00] <MariusIT> sry, for the delay
[06:24:30] <Cork> are you looking for ?api hasClass
[06:24:39] <Cork> ?api hasClass
[06:24:39] <b-ot> Cork: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[06:24:54] <eugenmayer> Your code makes no sense MariusIT .. check hasClass
[06:25:04] <MariusIT> ok
[06:25:09] <eugenmayer> arg. Sorry. Corky .. fast … Luke.. :)
[06:27:02] <MariusIT> eugenmayer: how about now? http://jsfiddle.net/YuENG/2/
[06:27:24] <eugenmayer> wrong.
[06:27:30] <MariusIT> rly? :(
[06:27:33] <MariusIT> why?
[06:27:44] <eugenmayer> if($(this).hasClass('share-facebook') … do stuff
[06:27:57] <MariusIT> but switch is usually faster ...
[06:28:04] <eugenmayer> because you rely that element to have _exactly_ one class and this does not make sense
[06:28:25] <eugenmayer> return is even faster then switch, also exit
[06:28:26] <MariusIT> oh, now i get it
[06:28:34] <MariusIT> the input is actually wrong
[06:28:42] <MariusIT> well, hold one, let me add the html
[06:28:58] <MariusIT> http://jsfiddle.net/YuENG/3/
[06:29:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/YuENG/4/
[06:29:20] <Cork> MariusIT: that is how you want to solve it
[06:30:43] <MariusIT> but it has exactly one class, why it's hasclass with if better?
[06:31:19] <Cork> MariusIT: cause if something somewhere needs to add a class to the element
[06:31:26] <Cork> you code won't break cause of it
[06:31:47] <Cork> MariusIT: and your code shouldn't have to be modified cause something else then your code touches the code
[06:31:49] <Cork> *dom
[06:31:57] <MariusIT> like an aditional class to that div ?
[06:32:00] <Cork> yes
[06:32:03] <MariusIT> hmm
[06:32:04] <MariusIT> i need
[06:32:07] <MariusIT> see
[06:32:15] <MariusIT> ok, thanks for the info
[06:32:41] <Cork> ugg...
[06:32:41] <MariusIT> i'll use switch tough, since the template is not gooing to be modifyed, gonna go with your solution in case it will
[06:32:46] <Cork> then your code...
[06:32:52] <Cork> i'm talking in code...
[06:32:53] <Cork> >_<
[06:33:23] <Cork> MariusIT: you should never assume things like this
[06:33:30] <Cork> it makes life hard down the road
[06:33:39] <MariusIT> :(
[06:33:42] <Cork> and then when you have 30+ places that assume it
[06:33:55] <Cork> it is NOT fun having to run around all over the place and update the code
[06:34:09] <Cork> just cause you want to add a style for some reason
[06:34:24] <Cork> meaning something that should take 5 mins to fix
[06:34:28] <Cork> takes 4+h
[06:34:28] <MariusIT> i'm trying to squeeze every bit of performance i can, using hasClass  with if seems more slower
[06:34:53] <Cork> MariusIT: don't do premature optimizations
[06:35:11] <Cork> build stable code and when you find painpoints optimize those
[06:35:31] <MariusIT> ok
[06:35:32] <Cork> else you generate code that is hard to maintain for no reason
[06:36:09] <MariusIT> ty
[06:36:19] <sammich_> felt the urge to make this, spent a few hours pefecting it tonight http://fiddle.jshell.net/Lb3q2/53/show/light/
[06:36:47] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/uJKWw/ anyone any idea why this request wont show? on fiddler i receive the api request fine but when it comes to display it doesnt work
[06:37:02] <sammich_> just a wall of text that is fit to the screen
[06:37:11] <MariusIT> cool
[06:38:13] <sammich_> btw, it's only perfectly fitted in Chrome
[06:38:26] <sammich_> haven't bothered with the others, and Safari doesn't seem to scale right
[06:38:48] <krambiorix> Cork, any other suggestions i might try?
[06:39:29] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to verify the data you actually store in the object
[06:39:44] <Cork> simplest is to console.log in and deep dive into what you have there
[06:40:07] <krambiorix> Cork, but it's all text , numbers...
[06:40:24] <Cork> possibly break out parts of the code (comment out the deeper ones) and just see what you get
[06:40:56] <Cork> krambiorix: so instead of testing it all at the end test each step so you know the earlier step works
[06:41:20] <Cork> and use JSON.stringify on the different sections to test if things behave as you want
[06:41:31] <Cork> i can't really help much more without access to the real data
[06:44:38] <krambiorix> Cork, maybe this will help then : http://pastebin.com/0TvfVMxZ
[06:45:05] <Cork> []{ <-- ??
[06:45:25] <krambiorix> Cork, firebug gives me that
[06:45:38] <Cork> uh...
[06:46:29] <Cork> not sure what you have in the variable then
[06:46:33] <Cork> cause that doesn't even parse
[06:46:58] <Cork> what does typeof($('body').data('boekingen')) give you?
[06:47:54] <krambiorix> Cork, object
[06:48:18] <Cork> seutje: do you have an idea?
[06:48:51] <seutje> I have many ideas, but they all lead to certain death
[06:48:53] <Cork> krambiorix: i don't get what the [] in there could be, and...
[06:48:58] <seutje> - Marvin
[06:49:52] <Cork> krambiorix: all i can say is that output looks broken
[06:49:56] <cannap> hi can any tell me why redirect is not defined? http://laravel.io/bin/eNwn
[06:50:05] <cannap> on line 17
[06:50:29] <Cork> cannap: never EVER use strings with setTimeout
[06:50:46] <Cork> cannap: setTimeout('redirect()', 3000); => setTimeout(redirect, 3000);
[06:50:50] <cannap> ah
[06:50:51] <cannap> OMG
[06:50:51] <Cork> should solve your problems
[06:51:34] <cannap> lol i made a tutorial
[06:51:38] <cannap> there shows 'function()', 300
[06:51:47] <cannap> aeh i found a tutorial i mean
[06:51:50] <krambiorix> seutje any idea...?
[06:51:58] <seutje> nope
[06:52:07] <Cork> cannap: find a new tutorial
[06:52:08] <seutje> don't even get why a console.dir would stringify the keys
[06:52:17] <Cork> preferably one that is made for post 2000
[06:52:23] <cannap> works now thx
[06:52:33] <krambiorix> Cork, forget the [] , i think i miss copy pasted in firebug
[06:52:40] <Cork> cannap: if you are using w3schools please stop directly
[06:52:49] <cannap> now used google first result :D
[06:52:52] <seutje> if the [] isn't there, it looks valid
[06:52:56] <cannap> http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascriptredirect.php
[06:53:07] <seutje> but that's already JSON, and I don't see you converting it anywhere o.O
[06:53:07] <cannap> use now firefox database
[06:53:20] <cannap> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
[06:53:20] <krambiorix> seutje, but it doesn't send with ajax
[06:53:30] <krambiorix> ow
[06:54:27] <Cork> cannap: ya, mdn or opera is two good places to look
[06:54:38] <Cork> http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/#toc
[06:54:57] <seutje> and and webplatform
[06:55:18] <krambiorix> Cork, seutje when i do data.boekingen = JSON.stringify($('body').data('boekingen'));  -> in firebug i see that boekingen is an empty array
[06:55:19] <ankurk_> Cork: I never looked at dev.opera
[06:55:51] <seutje> wtf
[06:56:35] <seutje> so if you console.dir it, it's a JSON string representing an object, but when you JSON stringify that, it becomes an empty array?
[06:57:07] <seutje> if you typeof that object, does it say "magic"?
[06:57:24] <Cork> heh
[06:57:25] <gumble> I want a button, when I click it jquery should do stuff and afterwards trigger a submit....now I have a input type="button". is there something like "submit" for buttons?
[06:57:45] <gumble> I don't want $().click() because the user can also submit the button with keyboard
[06:57:51] <Cork> gumble: yes
[06:57:58] <krambiorix> seutje nope, it says object :D
[06:57:58] <Cork> <button> is submit by default
[06:58:00] <gumble> I want just if something is done with the button, pls trigger this
[06:58:11] <Cork> <button type="submit"> is the same thing
[06:58:20] <gumble> I have <input type="button">
[06:58:25] <seutje> krambiorix: yeah, I was kidding, I'm all out of ideas, I'm afraid
[06:58:35] <Cork> gumble: ya, that is a button without submit
[06:58:43] <seutje> if you can try recreating the issue in a working fiddle, so people can easily get the whole picture
[06:58:55] <Cork> gumble: <input type="submit"> is a poor mans legacy option for <button type="submit">
[06:59:08] <gumble> hm k
[06:59:10] <seutje> hey man, don't make fun of the poor
[06:59:15] <Cork> gumble: if you say it should be a button you effectively say it shouldn't be a submit
[06:59:35] <Cork> seutje: i use a poor mans proxy all the time (ssh -D)
[06:59:41] <seutje> :P
[06:59:58] <Cork> ?g poor mans proxy

[07:03:39] <krambiorix> seutje, can i maybe make everything an object?
[07:04:42] <seutje> everything secretly already is :P\
[07:04:52] <seutje> sorta kinda
[07:05:28] <gumble> ok $("button").submit doesn't work. I need something like $("button").click which is also triggered when user submits the button through another way then clicking
[07:05:30] <xec> var everything = {};
[07:06:21] <gumble> Cork: I think we missunderstood. I need a way to do some stuff with the form before it is submitted. so I need a button which doesn't submit but only calls a javascript function which executes some stuff and then that javascript function triggers the submit
[07:06:25] <xec> gumble: attach to the form
[07:06:36] <xec> gumble: $("form").submit(func)
[07:06:48] <krambiorix> seutje, when i console.log(JSON.stringify($('body').data('boekingen'))) -> i get []
[07:07:08] <gumble> xec: that doesn't work because of the stuff I just wrote to Cork. I can't have a submit handler which first prevents submit and then triggers it himself again
[07:07:14] <gumble> that would be endless or not?
[07:07:33] <Cork> gumble: submit doesn't happen on the button
[07:07:36] <Cork> it happens on the form
[07:07:49] <Cork> and yes you can trigger the final submit without triggering the event again
[07:08:34] <Cork> gumble: $('form').submit(function(event) { event.preventDefault(); var self = this; $.ajax().done(function() { self.submit(); }) });
[07:08:39] <gumble> Cork: So when I do event.preventDefault(); .......................; $('form#create-page').submit(); in my submit handler that won't kill everthing?
[07:08:48] <Cork> it will
[07:08:54] <sammich_> okay, take two. Just wanna show something off here, if you guys will have me. http://fiddle.jshell.net/Lb3q2/59/show/light/
[07:08:55] <Cork> you use the dom function
[07:09:00] <Cork> not the jquery one
[07:09:20] <Cork> gumble: also never tagnames infront of id's
[07:09:27] <Cork> $('form#create-page') => $('#create-page')
[07:09:32] <xec> note the self.submit() as opposed to $(self).submit()
[07:09:39] <Cork> ya
[07:09:39] <gumble> Cork: Why? Increases readability
[07:09:49] <Cork> gumble: and slowing down the selector
[07:09:59] <Cork> $('form#create-page') $('form').find('#create-page')
[07:10:26] <Cork> while $('#create-page') just becomes an id lookup in the browsers id hash table
[07:10:46] <gumble> Cork: ok thanks for that
[07:14:38] <gumble> Cork: With your var self = this; solution I am getting: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'submit' of object #<HTMLFormElement> is not a function
[07:14:38] <gumble> at the point of self.submit();
[07:14:58] <Cork> O_o
[07:15:03] <Cork> in what browser?
[07:15:37] <sammich_> seems like you just had self()
[07:15:59] <Cork> gumble: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement.submit
[07:16:14] <gumble> Cork: Chromium
[07:16:24] <gumble> Cork: But I don't have an Ajax call like you did
[07:16:32] <Cork> gumble: doesn't matter
[07:16:35] <sammich_> oops
[07:16:45] <gumble> I do event.preventDefault();
[07:16:46] <gumble> 	var self = this;
[07:16:46] <Cork> HTMLFormElements do have a submit function
[07:16:51] <Cork> unless you've removed it for some reason
[07:16:56] <xec> make sure you're not using id="submit" or name="submit" or something funky like that
[07:17:08] <Cork> ah
[07:17:09] <Cork> true
[07:17:09] <gumble> 	tinyMCE.triggerSave();
[07:17:09] <gumble> 	console.log("I got triggered");
[07:17:20] <gumble> 	self.submit();
[07:17:27] <gumble> in the form submit handler
[07:17:56] <gumble> Oh yes I do... I just copied the text from the codeigniter tutorial
[07:17:56] <gumble> sorry
[07:18:01] <gumble> and thanks!
[07:18:06] <Cork> ...
[07:18:12] <Cork> man really use a better tutorial...
[07:18:22] <Cork> your going to learn the wrong things from there
[07:18:50] <gumble> Cork: you know the documentations or just because of the error with submit?
[07:19:15] <Cork> gumble: from the long list of severe errors we've talked about here in the last 15 mins
[07:19:40] <gumble> Cork: hmm ok I will look out for sure
[07:19:52] <Cork> it is quite clear that the writer of that article doesn't really know what they are doing

[07:50:41] <xKraty> or that http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/allDayDefault/ murosai
[07:51:30] <murosai> nah the allDayDefault doesn't work
[07:52:28] <xKraty> the event should also have a prop allDay, set it to false
[07:54:37] <sammich_> maybe prevent event resizing when the start date != end date?
[07:55:21] <murosai> xKraty: yup i tried setting it to false and true, doesn't help
[07:56:05] <sammich_> remove .ui-resizable-handle in week/month view ;)
[07:56:07] <xKraty> you got resizable enabled?
[07:57:01] <sammich_> you probably still can resize, just not over a day
[07:59:46] <murosai> i don't think there is a way to to do what i want, i might as well modify the plugin and maybe suggest a patch
[08:01:10] <xKraty> what you want to accomplish?
[08:01:29] <sammich_> remove the rendering of the '.ui-resizable-handle' element in month view at least
[08:02:23] <sammich_> actually, that's all you need to do? you can't drag over multiple days in Week or day view
[08:02:49] <Vivekananda> having a weird issue and dont even know how to troubleshoot. I am using bootstrap and used this code for 3 level dropdown. It works great on the main page ie index.php but on subsequent redirects the level1 works but level 2 and 3 dont
[08:02:59] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/chirayu45/YXkUT/16/
[08:03:16] <Vivekananda> my question is. Where should I put the jquery page so that it is called ?
[08:04:13] <murosai> xKraty: the same thing i said, disable events from spanning multiple days
[08:05:02] <sammich_> murosai: what ways can users possibly create multiple day events?
[08:06:24] <murosai> the user don't create the events
[08:06:29] <murosai> users*
[08:07:00] <sammich_> so the events are pulled in from a datasource?
[08:07:01] <murosai> the calendar is only used for viewing
[08:07:03] <murosai> yup
[08:07:15] <sammich_> can't you just modify the data then?
[08:07:35] <murosai> i could, but it's a bit hacky way of doing it tbh
[08:07:36] <sammich_> the fullCalendar is just displaying what you're giving it
[08:08:12] <murosai> the events do lasts multiple days but the users only really care about start date
[08:09:15] <murosai> hm
[08:09:22] <sammich_> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/eventDataTransform/
[08:09:35] <sammich_> enddate = startdate
[08:10:11] <murosai> ooh
[08:10:34] <murosai> that's excellent, i already actually do some transformation in the backend side but this seems like the appropriate place
[08:10:56] <sammich_> I wasn't suggesting you do it server side
[08:11:30] <murosai> yeah, i mean i should NOT do it on server side
[08:11:31] <sammich_> although, I'd probably give the users the options of showing the full event date span
[08:12:18] <sammich_> mission accomplished
[08:12:23] <sammich_> I can sleep now. Best of luck.
[08:12:30] <murosai> haha, thanks
[08:30:14] <ram_> can we install mac os in dell inspiron desktop
[08:30:41] <sammich_> wrong channel
[08:30:42] <BillCriswell> ram_: Not sure this is the best place to ask that haha.
[08:31:13] <sammich_> just google for osx86
[08:31:13] <xKraty> not sure there is an hackintosh channel o.O

[08:41:25] <ankurk_> :|
[08:42:19] <xKraty> haha
[08:42:34] <BillCriswell> Chrome has been doing some really weird shit lately.
[08:44:22] <BillCriswell> Every once in a while I just get like a picture of a webpage instead of the webpage. I can't interact or scroll or anything.
[08:45:18] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: Are you using Canary?
[08:45:32] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Nope. Just Chrome.
[08:45:55] <ankurk_> You should try to update it, if the update is available
[08:45:57] <BillCriswell> It's Windows XP, so I'm just coughing it up to that.
[08:46:11] <ankurk_> What! Windows XP? Come on man, it's 2014.
[08:46:12] <xKraty> xp still exixsts o.o?
[08:46:15] <BillCriswell> No updates for it currently.
[08:46:27] <ankurk_> yeah surprisingly, XP is still in support by Windows
[08:46:32] <ankurk_> *Microsoft
[08:46:41] <xKraty> i m on MS-DOS lol
[08:46:49] <ankurk_> lmao
[08:47:01] <xKraty> just got some issue with latest directx
[08:47:08] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: Change your OS man.
[08:47:13] <ankurk_> that might be the issue.
[08:47:27] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: That sounds like a whole... thing.
[08:47:32] <ankurk_> or as open source fanboys would say, switch to Linux.
[08:47:48] <xKraty> i dont like linux, well he dont like me
[08:47:51] <BillCriswell> It's my work computer so I would need to make sure it's cool with all the applications and shit we have.
[08:47:53] <xKraty> so i took a macbook lol
[08:48:05] <ankurk_> XP on a work computer!? :O
[08:48:23] <BillCriswell> I have OSX here on my laptop so I could alos develop on here and when it's ready put it on the work machine.
[08:49:14] <ankurk_> OS X or Linux both are great for dev work.
[08:49:45] <hellothere> hey there, anyone has any wysigw markdown editor to suggest? easy to implement
[08:49:50] <BillCriswell> I'm too lazy for Linux... well, the Linux I tried back when I was a youngin.
[08:50:18] <BillCriswell> I thought the point of markdown was so you wouldn't really need to use a wysiwyg?
[08:50:35] <BillCriswell> I was using lik... Mandrake 8 or something.
[08:50:43] <hellothere> well i just need to edit it though in the cms desk
[08:50:45] <ska-fan> Is one of $.each(array, ...) or $(array).each(...) preferable over the other?
[08:50:52] <ankurk_> You should use something like Arch
[08:50:54] <ska-fan> for normal JS arrays
[08:51:19] <BillCriswell> If it's a normal array you can just use a for loop.
[08:51:39] <BillCriswell> Haha, its not even called Mandrake anymore.
[08:52:14] <ska-fan> BillCriswell: Yes. Is there a big difference between the two ways I gave above?
[08:52:56] <ankurk_> I think I have used Mandrake before.
[08:53:05] <xKraty> meh
[08:53:15] <xKraty> heading to home and happy for the starting week end!
[08:53:18] <xKraty> seeeee ya!
[08:53:18] <BillCriswell> ska-fan: $.each( array, ).. would be more appropriate for a normal array.
[08:53:23] <BillCriswell> xKraty: Enjoy!
[08:53:33] <xKraty> thanks! bubye!
[08:53:40] * xKraty slaps ankurk_ and vanish
[08:54:52] <duch_kazatel> aaaah friday
[08:55:09] <BillCriswell> Also, payday.
[08:55:24] <duch_kazatel> maybe for you.  JERK
[08:55:24] <BillCriswell> Going to eat something gooooood today.
[08:55:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha. Well, I get paid monthly so it's not that awesome.
[08:56:09] <duch_kazatel> oh fair enough.
[08:56:21] <ankurk_> It's payday for me too :D
[08:58:17] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I am slowly digging the monthly thing. I pay my bills immediately then I have nothing to worry about. I don't ever think like "Ah, I can wait two weeks to pay that" and forget about it.
[08:58:57] <duch_kazatel> i used to get paid bi-weekly.  and not "almost every two weeks", but literally "every other friday", so rent and bills were usually interesting
[08:58:57] <duch_kazatel> though that did give me the occasional 3-payday month
[08:58:57] <duch_kazatel> i started using Asana for stuff like that.  and my wife's memory is crazy good for that stuff.
[08:59:59] <duch_kazatel> but yeah i can see the value there.
[09:00:46] <decx> i never know when i can write new bills so i always have a year of rent/healthcare saved
[09:00:55] <duch_kazatel> if I made enough, I'd be down.
[09:01:41] <duch_kazatel> that's smart.
[09:02:00] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm jealous of that... there's no reason I shouldn't be able to have that in the bank but I never come close lol.
[09:02:03] <decx> freelancing would be too volatile otherwise
[09:02:07] <BillCriswell> I just like spending way too much.
[09:02:37] <BillCriswell> I love when I get a bit of freelancing work. I should look into doing more of it.
[09:05:16] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[09:05:22] <duch_kazatel> i don't know why i don't.
[09:11:39] <decx> because it never stops
[09:11:51] <decx> i'm jealous of an end of the workday :D
[09:12:09] <decx> it's friday and i have to do clientwork all night ^^
[09:13:06] <shalini1992> ankurk, Billcriswell i dint find href link on any datepicker :(
[09:13:25] <ankurk_> shalini1992: you're using jQuery right?
[09:13:40] <shalini1992> yes
[09:14:22] <BillCriswell> decx: That sucks. I do love my time not working... even though I'm still usually coding haha.
[09:14:37] <decx> hehe
[09:14:51] <decx> i build my canvas game to wind down ;)
[09:15:05] <ankurk_> shalini1992: then use this, http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[09:15:22] <sekyms> :-p
[09:16:14] <ankurk_> but decx, tell me on thing, you do have to market yourself when freelancing right?
[09:16:17] <ankurk_> *one
[09:17:53] <shalini1992> ankurk_ using that only..
[09:18:42] <ankurk_> shalini1992: what problems you are having then?
[09:19:44] <shalini1992> ankurk_: supoose 3 dates of feb are highlighted now what i need is if i click on one of them an html page must open
[09:20:13] <decx> ankurk_ once you do a few projects you get mouth to mouth advertisement which is much more effective than self marketing
[09:22:30] <shalini1992> ankurk_ href link on some dates of calender
[09:25:29] <ankurk_> decx: what about the initial stages?
[09:25:39] <ankurk_> asking because I am interested in freelancing too
[09:26:30] <decx> don'T bother if you don't have 1 or 2 clients with considerable work for you
[09:27:01] <decx> get contacts with clients in fulltime
[09:27:59] <decx> otherwise you end up in my spambox with a message like "we visited decx.org and we can offer you SEO MARKETING BUZZWORDS"
[09:28:15] <ankurk_> hmm, I follow a lot of freelancers on Twitter, and some of them earn really good
[09:28:45] <decx> yeah for every successful one there are 50 mediocre ones and 50 failed ones
[09:29:16] <decx> i'm a terrible writer so i have to rely on mouth to mouth ;)
[09:29:37] <ankurk_> and moreover, one thing I realised is lack of a mentor
[09:29:40] <ankurk_> who would guide me
[09:29:42] <sekyms> and fifty mediocre ones that are doing awesome
[09:30:02] <decx> hehe
[09:30:25] <decx> never had a mentor either, would make things easier i guess
[09:31:03] <Erryl> The css file of the menu widget gets some errors when I validate it with the CSS validator. Parse Error Opacity = 60), is there any way I can fix this?
[09:31:11] <ankurk_> well, my ultimate goal is to be renowned for my work not end up having a regular job
[09:39:49] <Erryl> How can I fix the error : Parse Error Opacity=60)
[09:40:10] <decx> fix your opacity css
[09:40:17] <decx> opacity: 60;
[09:40:53] <decx> and for ie compatibility filter:alpha(opacity=60)
[09:41:28] <Erryl> decx: That is what I am using --> filter:Alpha(Opacity=0); , but it doesn't get validated
[09:43:12] <decx> write alpha small maybe?
[09:43:26] <decx> should only be in a ie specific style anyway so screw validation
[09:43:59] <decx> or just scrap it, ie8 and lower dont need opacity
[09:44:21] <decx> screw the rules, i have money
[09:45:06] <Erryl> decx: I'll try it in smalll letters, else I just remove the lines
[09:53:23] <duch_kazatel> well this has been a fun morning.
[09:53:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Did I miss something?
[09:53:54] <duch_kazatel> freenode is having problems.
[09:53:56] <duch_kazatel> big time.
[09:54:16] <decx> what's unusual about that?
[09:54:30] <BillCriswell> I wish I understand the reason for the attacks.
[09:54:30] <mdev> they're being flooded apparently
[09:54:35] <duch_kazatel> haha, it's worse than it usually is.  and as an american i demand all things work perfectly for me at all times.
[09:54:37] <mdev> immature users
[09:54:40] <duch_kazatel> :P
[09:54:48] <ankurk_> IRCCloud is working fine on my end
[09:55:08] <mdev> it'd help if channel admins and staff took my advice though, i'd imagine and stop the kick ban non-sense, temp quiets are more effective and less dramatic
[09:55:10] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ it's individual servers getting knocked off.
[09:55:25] <mdev> but no...channel admins kick and ban all day, so they probably upset someone
[09:55:29] <mdev> that's my guess
[09:55:38] <decx> shadowbanning is an amazing technique to fight spam
[09:56:00] <decx> i implemented it on a anonymous comment form for a client
[09:56:03] <BillCriswell> "We must stop these people from helping others and building incredibly useful things for free!"
[09:56:20] <decx> load the comment into localstorage and serve it to the person until it's approved
[09:56:42] <mdev> Freenode dissolved pdpc a year ago, meaning they accept no more donations and apparently canceled some other stuff
[09:56:46] <decx> so if it's never approved they still think it was and wonder why nobody answers
[09:56:53] <mdev> so freenode sadly could be shutdown if flooding continues over time
[09:57:14] <mdev> those that donate servers have to pay for bandwidth, one way or another and could become too costly for them to be apart of freenode
[09:57:38] <mdev> Freenode was almost shut down years ago from flooding too, I believe I read
[09:57:51] <decx> what's the target ?
[09:58:27] <mdev> no idea, they maybe attacking random servers, or all their servers
[09:59:43] <BillCris_> :-/
[10:00:10] <decx> did you time out?
[10:00:50] <decx> havent noticed any problems on the german server
[10:01:26] <mdev> adams.freenode.net been stable
[10:01:32] <mdev> hasn't dropped last night or today
[10:02:08] <decx> yeah my bnc has been stable on kornbluth for a week
[10:21:43] <_genuser_> so I can't figure out how to change the css class of an object.
[10:21:48] <_genuser_> not just add to it.
[10:22:02] <duch_kazatel> .removeClass().addClass()
[10:22:15] <_genuser_> I have this so far: $('.ui-dialog-buttonpane').find('button:contains("Cancel")').Class('ButtonBlue');
[10:22:39] <_genuser_> I was hoping to just say .class("newclass"), deleting what is already in there.
[10:23:04] <_genuser_> that way I don't have see in object inspector what's assinged and with new version of jquery, don't have to worry about removing new classes.
[10:23:49] <duch_kazatel> .attr('class', 'newClass')
[10:25:08] <duch_kazatel> that's the other way to do it.
[10:26:23] <duch_kazatel> but i like to be more explicit about what i'm doing, so I'm fine with adding/removing things manually.
[10:29:10] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: ok, that worked. thanks. :)
[10:29:30] <duch_kazatel> make sure you pop in a comment above that so it's obvious what you're doing.
[10:29:54] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: I tend to create classes that are object specific by doing INPUT.buttonblue {}  in my css.
[10:30:07] <_genuser_> which broke in this case because the element is a <button>.
[10:30:46] <_genuser_> is there any consensus or recommendations from CSS team about whether to prefix the element type before a class name or to leave it generic.
[10:30:52] <_genuser_> re: adding comment, will do.
[10:31:39] <Velveeta_> i don't ever prefix the tag name on my css classes
[10:31:57] <Velveeta_> i try to keep them generic and descriptive to be used in multiple cases
[10:32:19] <duch_kazatel> it's also slower to do it that way.
[10:32:34] <Velveeta_> so .red may define a red background color, but div.red may define a dark red border also, or span.red might negate the background color and make it a font color instead, etc
[10:33:49] <_genuser_> I see.
[10:34:08] <_genuser_> I have recently starting using classes more appropriately.
[10:34:24] <_genuser_> so have a class .RightFloat{} for anything that should float: right.
[10:34:27] <Velveeta_> but there are different schools of thought on css architectures, there's oocss, smacss, etc
[10:34:43] <_genuser_> bofore I'd create a unique class for each case and apply all styles to it.
[10:35:20] <_genuser_> and recently I chagned to using multiple generic classes to apply an effect to one of more items.
[10:35:37] <duch_kazatel> also: css preprocessors are cool.
[10:36:04] <Velveeta_> i don't know how i ever did shit before preprocessors :D
[10:36:16] * _genuser_ googles css preprocessors
[10:36:27] <Velveeta_> _genuser_ things like less, sass, scss, stylus, etc
[10:37:14] <duch_kazatel> sass uses scss btw
[10:37:22] <duch_kazatel> less and sass are the two cool kids.  we uses sass here.
[10:37:45] <_genuser_> yep reading about those now. :) boy, when did web application development become more than <html><body> <font color="red"> <blink>HELLO!!!!!!</blink> </font> </body></html>
[10:38:10] <duch_kazatel> back when i was in JR high.  i remember my dad talking about how neat CSS was.
[10:38:52] <Velveeta_> yeah, my dad caught onto css around the early to mid 2000's
[10:39:05] <Velveeta_> when he was playing fucking asheron's call, and wanted to make a guild site :D
[10:39:19] <_genuser_> hmmm, you both sound so young.
[10:39:41] <Velveeta_> i'm 35
[10:39:54] <Velveeta_> my dad just happened to talk to me about that stuff when he was hooked on that game :D
[10:40:12] <duch_kazatel> I'm 27 in april.
[10:40:28] <Velveeta_> _genuser_ if you really wanna see some fanciness that'll blow your mind on where web dev is at these days, go check out some videos on google's polymer project
[10:41:50] <duch_kazatel> polymer is just webcomponents sorta.
[10:41:51] <duch_kazatel> which is neat.
[10:42:20] <Velveeta_> right, it's where i've been waiting for us to get to for a few years now, truly isolated componentry in the client
[10:43:14] <duch_kazatel> yup
[10:43:15] <_genuser_> yeah building on frameworks on top of other frameworks really helps move things to the next level.
[10:43:23] <duch_kazatel> it's like iframes but, y'know, better.
[10:43:28] <duch_kazatel> :P
[10:43:37] <duch_kazatel> but yeah webcomponents are a huge next step.
[10:43:43] <_genuser_> I remember doing all this jquery type form popping up and background overlays back in 2003 using all JS handrolled.
[10:43:59] <duch_kazatel> modals, you mean?
[10:43:59] <shalini1992> hi http://jsfiddle.net/lacmop/XPTax/2/ in this i want to disable the dates without links any help
[10:44:01] <_genuser_> but man, was it a hassle or waht.
[10:44:02] <nhulea_nsa_> duch_kazatel: you are rocking in js and jquery do you have like 2 windows open or something haha
[10:44:10] <_genuser_> even now it's a bit of a hassle but not as much as it was then.
[10:44:12] <duch_kazatel> mIRC.
[10:44:20] <nhulea_nsa_> wrd haha
[10:44:25] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa_ i use mIRC and am way familiar with keyboard shortcuts.
[10:44:35] <_genuser_> mIRC that brings back memories.
[10:44:41] <nhulea_nsa_> hell yeah I am on chatzilla
[10:44:50] <duch_kazatel> i'm helping a coworker, reading a blog post, and watching email.  friday, bitches
[10:45:04] <_genuser_> used to use it with automated dcc send bots to download tv shows way back.
[10:45:05] <nhulea_nsa_> watching email?
[10:45:12] <decx> i'm on irc & on pornhub cracking one off
[10:45:13] <nhulea_nsa_> video email?
[10:45:16] <_genuser_> friday indeed.
[10:45:20] <nhulea_nsa_> tgif
[10:45:34] <shalini1992> hi all m new to jquery need a lil help..
[10:45:49] <nhulea_nsa_> I created this tgif plugin for jquery  haha
[10:47:54] <shalini1992> ?
[10:48:50] <nhulea_nsa_> I can help ?
[10:48:55] <nhulea_nsa_>  whats your problem ?>
[10:49:52] <shalini1992>  hi http://jsfiddle.net/lacmop/XPTax/2/ in this i want to disable the dates without links any help
[10:49:52] <_genuser_> shalini1992: http://jsfiddle.net/CxNNh/526/
[10:50:44] <_genuser_> shalini1992: click in teh input to launch the datepicker.
[10:51:35] <nhulea_nsa_> _genuser_: didnt they want to stop being able to click the dates without links I can still click all the dates ?
[10:51:51] <shalini1992> _genuser_: can we do it like highlight dates that r in the list n disable all others?
[10:52:14] <_genuser_> nhulea_nsa_: on my mine the feb 14th, 2014 is disabled
[10:52:24] <nhulea_nsa_> oh worf
[10:52:27] <Velveeta_> "duch_kazatel: i'm helping a coworker, reading a blog post, and watching email.  friday, bitches" <-- lulz
[10:52:29] <nhulea_nsa_> word
[10:52:49] <nhulea_nsa_> I am still confused about the watching email
[10:53:00] <_genuser_> think he meant, he's monitoring it.
[10:53:29] <_genuser_> shalini1992: you mean reverse it. only shows the ones in the array as enabled?
[10:53:38] <shalini1992> _geuser_: yes
[10:55:27] <_genuser_> shalini1992: not sure. let's see if the docs mentioned anything.
[10:56:38] <shalini1992> _genuser_: ok, i have a list of dates that when clicked must redirect to specific pages, and so i want others to b disabled
[10:57:04] <shalini1992> others means dates not in the list
[11:03:30] <duch_kazatel> you could always text, in click, if the current date is in the array.
[11:03:38] <duch_kazatel> *test
[11:05:46] <shalini1992> duch_kazatel: sorry, din't understand
[11:06:49] <shalini1992> ?
[11:06:59] <_genuser_> shalini1992: oh the docs pretty clear. just reverse the return values.
[11:07:02] <_genuser_> http://jsfiddle.net/CxNNh/527/
[11:07:04] <duch_kazatel> or do that.
[11:08:03] <shalini1992> _genuser: thank u :)
[11:08:05] <_genuser_> :)
[11:08:18] <_genuser_> instead of finishing my web app, I'm sitting here yapping on irc.
[11:08:22] <_genuser_> could just be the friday mentality.
[11:10:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm looking forward to our weekly beer session at work.
[11:10:46] <decx> on #jquery that's everyday mentality
[11:11:55] <duch_kazatel> truth
[11:12:36] <_genuser_> :)
[11:12:41] <_genuser_> weekly beer sessions at work?
[11:12:43] <_genuser_> nice!!
[11:13:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah. we call 'em "weekly wins".  write a thing you did on a whiteboard, grab a couple pints, shoot the shit wtih people.
[11:13:29] <_genuser_> very nice. our team mostly works from home.
[11:13:37] <duch_kazatel> my team is looking at building a kegbot, too.
[11:13:49] <duch_kazatel> work all ready approved the expense, so now we just need to do it.
[11:13:54] <_genuser_> one of my friends would start at noon and at 6 when I'd get there, he'd hand me a beer and say that he's already up by a six pack.
[11:14:05] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:14:09] <_genuser_> kegbot, lol. your work place ftw
[11:14:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah i love this place.
[11:14:30] <manus> Hey folks, quick q for someone. Is the list of supported selectors on jQuery's API site exhaustive? The ":hover" pseudo-class seems to have inconsistent behavior on IE8 (and probably earlier) when used for selection vs. filtering, even though the pseudoclass is supported and querySelectorAll is available (I'm in standards mode).
[11:14:34] <_genuser_> ours is so political. customer facing. big sales people with commissions.
[11:14:51] <duch_kazatel> manus what version of jquery are you using?
[11:14:59] <duch_kazatel> and yes, that list is exhaustive.
[11:15:04] <manus> I've seen in old closed:invalid bugs that the :hover pseudoclass isn't officially listed, so it's not supported.
[11:15:07] <manus> duch_kazatel: 1.11
[11:15:19] <duch_kazatel> ah, yeah.
[11:15:19] <numerical> anyone have spare invites to Atom.io beta
[11:15:21] <duch_kazatel> there's your issue.
[11:15:51] <manus> duch_kazatel: still seems off that $('body:hover') works, but $('body:hover').is('body:hover') doesn't..
[11:16:05] <duch_kazatel> welcome to the land of IE.
[11:16:30] <manus> duch_kazatel: though not sure it's entirely IE's fault, in this odd case
[11:16:56] <duch_kazatel> IE8 doesn't properly support .trigger('click'), soooo...
[11:17:00] <duch_kazatel> just saying, it's painful
[11:17:46] <manus> duch_kazatel: Trust me, I understand the pain having to support IE, but I haven't yet figured out what's going on here
[11:18:03] <manus> I looked through the code a bit, but haven't yet traced it in earnest
[11:18:31] <manus> it's just very strange and inconsistent
[11:18:37] <_genuser_> having coded on IE primarily, I have the opposite experience that most people.
[11:18:54] <_genuser_> I jsut make it work in IE. the rest work beautifully as expected.
[11:18:55] <duch_kazatel> yeah IE9 and above are actually pretty easy.
[11:18:59] <BillCris_> duch_kazatel: Really?
[11:18:59] <BillCris_> Abotu the IE .triggeR() thing?
[11:19:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCris_ yep.  just saw it rear its head again recently.
[11:19:23] <decx> that's why i build everything with as graceful degradation as possible, if ie makes trouble: no soup for you
[11:19:33] <manus> _genuser_: agreed with duch_kazatel, though I'm talking about <IE9
[11:19:53] <duch_kazatel> manus in this case, you might need to completely change how you're approaching your solution tbh.
[11:20:01] <_genuser_> yeah, I've been coding since IE5 with IE as my main browser.
[11:20:02] <BillCris_> duch_kazatel: Yuck.
[11:20:07] <_genuser_> because it was what was installed at work, mostly.
[11:20:09] <duch_kazatel> BillCris_ yep.
[11:21:17] <manus> duch_kazatel: there are a couple places where I use the :hover pseudoclass for different reasons, though one is for a kind of tooltip plugin
[11:21:31] <_genuser_> lol amazon sends me an email that they're refunding an amazon price membership per my request. I never paid for it and never requested a refund.
[11:21:31] <manus> I know how to fix it for that one, and probably the others
[11:21:42] <_genuser_> *prime
[11:22:05] <Erryl> How should I use the function load if I want a certain layout on each of my html pages
[11:22:26] <duch_kazatel> Erryl don't use javascript for modifying layout.
[11:22:27] <manus> it's just weird.. I'll look more in debth at the source and see where IE8 is being treated differently
[11:22:30] <manus> *depth
[11:22:32] <duch_kazatel> not that big at least.
[11:23:25] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Well I have my layout and menu, but now I want that on each of my html pages, I mean I can copy and paste it, but then I have to make for instance a menu change at each of my html pages
[11:24:21] <duch_kazatel> Erryl are you using a server-side framework of some kind?
[11:24:34] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Nope
[11:24:54] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I read somewhere it was possible with the load method
[11:25:31] <decx> remember not to break the internet
[11:25:53] <duch_kazatel> Erryl so you're ajaxing in pages below your nav?
[11:26:04] <decx> persistent urls that will point to specific content in a decade
[11:27:23] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I'm not really sure if that includes the load method. Is there any other way to achieve what I want by only using client side?
[11:27:56] <duch_kazatel> Erryl you want a static navbar with ajaxed in content, right?
[11:28:16] <duch_kazatel> because .load() is just a wrapper for $.ajax();
[11:28:58] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Aha I see, but yeah I want a static menu, so I can add that to each of my html pages without copying whole the code for the menu to each page
[11:29:11] <duch_kazatel> that's the wrong way to go about it.
[11:29:44] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: You remember my html code yesterday? Should I copy that in all of my pages?
[11:30:12] <duch_kazatel> I don't remember it, sorry.  if it's a navigation, copy it to each page.
[11:30:25] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I will copy it again, hold on
[11:30:25] <duch_kazatel> or use a server-side framework to help you with this.
[11:31:24] <BillCriswell> jedimind: I asked this in SASS yesterday but figured I'd ask in here as well. Let's say I'd like to create a new column ( all columns must be even ) every 200px. Is my only option to create a new breakpoint every 200px?
[11:32:17] <duch_kazatel> Erryl if you want to use ajax (and that's for you to figure out), you should create a single page that has your base "wrapper", and then ajax in each page as needed.
[11:32:19] <BillCriswell> I actually feel like javascript may be better for this. :-/
[11:32:23] <lbracher> hi, guys! I'm trying to do an ajax call, it works on chrome but not on safari. did you hear about that issue? TIA!
[11:32:33] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ lbracher
[11:32:33] <b-ot> lbracher: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:33:00] <ankurk_> One question, why do you guys prefer jsfiddle?
[11:33:12] <duch_kazatel> it's always less buggy for me.
[11:33:17] <duch_kazatel> and easier.
[11:33:26] <systemfault> ankurk_: What other live pastebin would you use?
[11:33:30] <decx> i like that it just runs when i click run
[11:33:39] <BillCriswell> I prefer jsbin, but it can do weird shit at times.
[11:33:42] <duch_kazatel> or when you hit ctrl+enter on windows.
[11:33:43] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/rZWqA/ here is my code
[11:33:50] <bite> How can apply styling from a style sheet (bootstrap) to dynamically loaded content? specifically a button.
[11:34:01] <duch_kazatel> bite it is all ready.
[11:34:02] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: So actually everything is static, except from the text in the content
[11:34:03] <BillCriswell> decx: That's togglable(word?) though.
[11:34:23] <duch_kazatel> Erryl okay, so you have a main content area and you want to ajax in each "page"?
[11:34:49] <decx> i also don't like jsbins pseudo console
[11:34:52] <bite> duch_kazatel: can't seem to get it working than... I created the element like this var button = document.createElement('button');
[11:35:10] <duch_kazatel> bite does it have the right classes and whatnot on it?
[11:35:24] <lbracher> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/E3CfJ/
[11:35:28] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: If ajax was the wrapped load method, then yes
[11:35:28] <BillCriswell> decx: I never used it.
[11:35:37] <bite> duch_kazatel: yup, i added those seperately, I will show you on hastebin
[11:35:48] <duch_kazatel> Erryl then you need a server-site framework to help you.
[11:36:07] <decx> it doesnt really matter anyway, whatever fits best, i just stuck to fiddle because i can say "fiddle me"
[11:36:17] <decx> "i'm the choirboy and you're the priest"
[11:36:41] <duch_kazatel> Erryl because otherwise you're going to do a bunch of crazy frontend logic to handle this.  for instance - what if somebody comes in from not the homepagE?
[11:36:47] <bite> duch_kazatel: http://hastebin.com/liwiguroni.scala
[11:36:51] <duch_kazatel> do you intend this site to be indexed by google?
[11:36:57] <BillCriswell> decx: fiddle me this, fiddle me that.
[11:37:17] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Hmm I see, I guess I just copy and paste the html code to each other 'page' then. Because I must only use client sided
[11:37:18] <decx> nice
[11:37:26] <duch_kazatel> Erryl why?
[11:37:36] <duch_kazatel> Erryl does the server support server-side includes?
[11:37:38] <bite> duch_kazatel: i want the button to be loaded dynamically so some bots can't find it
[11:37:57] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: It is an exercise to create my own site, but without using server-sided tech
[11:38:06] <ankurk_> systemfault: I would use jsbin
[11:38:25] <systemfault> Ah ok :P
[11:38:25] <duch_kazatel> Erryl why?  just because?
[11:38:33] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup
[11:38:49] <duch_kazatel> lbracher what error are you getting in the console in safari?
[11:39:19] <duch_kazatel> Erryl in that case, check out using $.ajax() (or .load()) and loading in individual content sections.
[11:39:33] <duch_kazatel> but be aware that things like hyperlinking will be a pain to implement.
[11:40:05] <duch_kazatel> bite looks like it's a javascript problem.  you consider using nofollow on the button instead?
[11:40:07] <lbracher> duck_kazatel: let me try to discover that, I begun using safari 5 minutes ago. :)
[11:40:09] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Well the links in the menu are links to my pages
[11:40:35] <duch_kazatel> Erryl right, but if you start ajaxing in content, how do you expect to link to given pages?
[11:41:02] <duch_kazatel> (hint: it's doable, but involves a lot more logic)
[11:41:06] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Hmm I don't know, don't know much about it
[11:41:20] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I guess it is better to copy and paste, since it ain't that much either
[11:41:38] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I mean it are only a couple of divs and a little menu now
[11:41:39] <duch_kazatel> Erryl if you're doing it simply as an exercise, then do it.
[11:42:00] <duch_kazatel> but the copy/paste will fall apart quickly when you want to start adding pages/removing pages/changing the nav.
[11:42:05] <bite> duch_kazatel: i'll look into it, but I doubt bots will care what value rel has... they'll just keep sending their viagra ads, ha
[11:42:06] <duch_kazatel> that's what server-side frameworks are for.
[11:42:16] <duch_kazatel> bite what's the button for?
[11:42:22] <bite> for a contact form
[11:42:35] <duch_kazatel> oh, i'd implement anti spam at that point.
[11:42:37] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yeah idd, it is a pain in the ass to maintain, that's why I wanted another solution. But that's a bit hard without server-side technology
[11:43:00] <bite> duch_kazatel: it's just so odd that there's no way to apply the css to dynamically loaded content...
[11:43:13] <duch_kazatel> bite that's because it's likely not the css.
[11:43:19] <duch_kazatel> css applies to "dynamically loaded content" just fine.
[11:43:24] <duch_kazatel> it's the javascript that doesn't.
[11:44:25] <lbracher> duch_kazatel: I put a console.log("Some error occurred"); on error block just to be sure, and this is the only error that I got
[11:45:23] <Shero> if I have 2D array how do I know the length of the columns, 'array[0].length' is not working
[11:45:34] <bite> duch_kazatel: alright, thanks for your help - i think i'm just going to find the btn styling from bootstraps css, and apply it manually, its horrible, but whatever.
[11:45:43] <lbracher> is it possible to make jQuery more verbose on console?
[11:47:52] <duch_kazatel> "length of the columns"
[11:48:15] <duch_kazatel> lbracher you can console.log the object getting returned.
[11:48:18] <Shero> so the length of the rows would be array.length
[11:48:26] <Shero> how about the coulmns?
[11:48:33] <duch_kazatel> Shero oh you mean an array of arrays.
[11:49:31] <Shero> I'm not sure of exact term, it is a 2D array
[11:49:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/
[11:49:53] <duch_kazatel> like this?
[11:49:58] <duch_kazatel> (code would be helpful.
[11:50:04] <duch_kazatel> lbracher i'd go read the ajax docs.
[11:50:19] <Shero> yes
[11:51:39] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to iterate through the array and do some magic.  one sec.
[11:54:50] <duch_kazatel> wait so given jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/1/, are you looking for 4, or for three?
[11:54:54] <lbracher> duch_kazatel I pasted on http://jsfiddle.net/E3CfJ/ the returned object as a comment. But this is strange, it works perfectly on firefox and chrome, but not in safari.
[11:55:09] <duch_kazatel> what's the error in safari?
[11:55:12] <duch_kazatel> it has dev tools.
[11:55:45] <lbracher> that error I picked on firebug lite
[11:55:54] <duch_kazatel> i don't see an error.
[11:56:01] <lbracher> let me try to discover where are the dev tools on safari
[11:56:04] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/E3CfJ/ - nothing in there.
[11:56:25] <duch_kazatel> Shero - did you see my question?
[11:56:46] <Shero> Thanks duch_kazatel I'm looking for the number of columns, in that case it is 3
[11:57:17] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/3/
[11:57:21] <duch_kazatel> then that works.
[11:57:43] <Shero> how do I get it? I can't do theArray[0].length?
[11:57:57] <duch_kazatel> ... theArray[0].length that gives you 3.
[11:58:07] <duch_kazatel> if that doesn't work, share your code.
[11:58:28] <Shero> it is not possible to do theArray[0].length
[11:58:33] <duch_kazatel> why?
[11:58:51] <Shero> it has a syntax error
[11:58:57] <duch_kazatel> then share your code.
[11:59:00] <duch_kazatel> I need to see the data.
[11:59:07] <Shero> ok 1 sec
[11:59:14] <duch_kazatel> are you using an array, or an object?
[12:00:57] <MarkyC> hey guys, when using $.ajax( success: function(data) { ... } ); How can I get an element from the data JSON reponse? console.log shows {"code":false,"discount":0}, but data.code is undefined
[12:01:11] <Shero> http://jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/1/
[12:01:34] <Shero> wait I didn't save it sorry
[12:02:13] <Shero> duch_kazatel that's it http://jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/4/
[12:03:31] <duch_kazatel> Shero this is not what I asked for - where is your data?
[12:04:37] <Shero> the array is returned from python, and I was able to get the array.length but now the array[0].length
[12:04:49] <duch_kazatel> Shero please share the javascript data.
[12:04:58] <duch_kazatel> because that tells me array[0] is not an array.
[12:05:30] <decx> length should work regardless
[12:05:46] <Shero> http://jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/5/
[12:06:07] <duch_kazatel> Shero I need the rendered code.
[12:06:11] <duch_kazatel> not the stuff from your backen.
[12:06:32] <duch_kazatel> I need to see what the javascript is actually working aganst - I have no idea what {{myarray|safe}} renders to.
[12:06:52] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:07:00] <Shero> tyt
[12:09:08] <duch_kazatel> jesus christ my keyboard player is a fucking idiot.
[12:09:49] <Shero> that's all what I can share http://jsfiddle.net/TW6MG/6/
[12:10:13] <duch_kazatel> Shero and yours has the same square brackets in the same palces?
[12:10:14] <duch_kazatel> *places?
[12:10:27] <duch_kazatel> because .length should work.  if it doesn't, you have bigger problems.
[12:10:31] <duch_kazatel> i need to go to lunch.  be back in a big.
[12:10:33] <duch_kazatel> *bit
[12:10:46] <decx> have a good one
[12:10:54] <decx> Shero http://jsfiddle.net/decx/TW6MG/7/
[12:11:29] <Shero> Thank you so much, I know why it is not working right now, you're the best

[12:36:29] <lbracher> duch_kazatel I didn't receive any error on console. The xhr object is a mistery to me. Could you help me how to spot the error? I repasted on http://jsbin.com/sejayasi/1/edit .
[12:38:10] <CoolCoder> Everytime this code http://pastebin.com/ScpqAtbi , when validation fails, this AJAX post call increases. any help?
[12:38:34] <BryanWB> i have been experimenting w/ headless browser testing. I have tried casperjs. Is there anything else I should try before i invest a lot in casperjs?
[12:39:12] <CoolCoder> a page is submited on click of a button, but every time validation fails, will bring back to form to correct. and then if submits, it will call AJAX twice, .... etc. http://pastebin.com/ScpqAtbi
[12:39:42] <Erryl> I used the menu widget from jquery UI, is there a way to make the links purple once you clicked them so you know what link you visited?
[12:42:53] <ankurk_> Erryl: you can add a class after they have been clicked.

[12:45:59] <ankurk_> Erryl: you can use this method on click, http://api.jquery.com/addclass/
[12:46:01] <Erryl> ankurk_ I guess I first have to use the .click for the links and after that add that class?
[12:46:17] <Erryl> ankurk_ : Oh you already said it
[12:46:21] <ankurk_> yep inside the on click method :)
[12:46:28] <maxmoore14> is there another permission I need to add that will enable file inputs for android?
[12:46:45] <Erryl> ankurk_ I'll try something, thanks!
[12:46:57] <ankurk_> you're welcome! :)
[12:47:45] <CoolCoder> I have an form which submits through AJAX. this is the link of AJAX code http://pastebin.com/ScpqAtbi , its repeating on every submit of button after validation. Check the console image http://i61.tinypic.com/2yl2rnp.png any help?
[12:50:48] <lbracher> Guys, I'm experiencing some problem while using ajax and url manipulation with safari. As I can see, Safari doesn't handle URL manipulation very well with window.location.href.split . what do you use instead that can be used on safari, firefox and chrome?
[12:53:52] <Erryl> ankurk_ Hmm I don't know what to fill in behind the empty # and the parentheses behind addClass  http://jsfiddle.net/qjTfe/
[12:54:50] <duch_lunch> Erryl that's not how you do that
[12:55:42] <lombriz> http://pastebin.com/jXJjkd0g - line 7,8,9 - is it possible to make this happen? just tried for the heck of it, and as i suspected, it did not work :P anyone got a idea? the amount of fields shown in the form is dynamic
[12:56:12] <duch_kazatel> lombriz what are you trying to do?
[12:56:25] <Erryl> duch_lunch: What am I doing wrong?
[12:56:27] <duch_kazatel> lombriz pass a function to that data property.
[12:56:29] <lombriz> trying to include a dynamic amount of fields. all fields are "field" + a number
[12:56:49] <duch_kazatel> Erryl are you trying to target an <a> tag?
[12:57:13] <ankurk_> Erryl: duch_kazatel to the rescue :D
[12:57:30] <lombriz> or perhaps i can pass an array :o
[12:58:00] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yes I am, I want to make it purple when I click on my link, I'm using the menu widget
[12:58:49] <duch_kazatel> Erryl all right, so here are the basics - first of all if you want to target a tag, use use the tagname.  for <a> tags it's just $(
[12:58:53] <duch_kazatel> *$('a')
[12:59:02] <duch_kazatel> for <div> it would be $('div')
[12:59:19] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[12:59:39] <duch_kazatel> the hash (#) symbol is for IDs. so if you had div id="ninjas", you'd use $('#ninjas');
[12:59:55] <duch_kazatel> and periods are for classes.
[13:00:09] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Aha I see
[13:00:11] <duch_kazatel> so div class="aClass" would be $('.aClass')
[13:00:13] <duch_kazatel> making sense so far?
[13:00:24] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yes
[13:00:55] <duch_kazatel> so in your code, you really want $('a').click, or the alternative $('a').on('click', function(){});
[13:01:22] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yes, I changed that now, took the first one
[13:02:48] <duch_kazatel> now, on a clicks, you want to prevent the default action of the event.
[13:03:03] <duch_kazatel> you can pass an event object to the handler - $("a").on('click', function(e) {
[13:03:18] <duch_kazatel> the "e" is the event object - jquery just sort of knows to do that.
[13:03:19] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: e.preventdefault?
[13:03:31] <lbracher> duch_kazatel I discovered, nevermind.
[13:03:49] <duch_kazatel> Erryl e.preventDefault()
[13:04:17] <lombriz> duch_kazatel: thanks for the data-hint. worked with making a js array then converting it to json and sending it to the php controller :)))
[13:04:21] <maxmoore14> need help with file uploading please - I have a <input type="file"> that works great in iOS but does nothing in Android
[13:04:27] <maxmoore14> is there another permission I need to add that will enable file inputs for android?
[13:04:31] <lbracher> The url was buggy
[13:04:40] <Delizin> I am using trying to bind this function http://jsfiddle.net/cBw7x/5/ to a group of html buttons' click events. However the buttons are part of a table that I retrieve from ajax so it does not exist when the page is created. Is there a way to bind the function after retrieving them from ajax?
[13:05:14] <lombriz> isnt it possible to do a on document ready, in the bottom of the page, and bind them there?
[13:05:50] <lombriz> or do it in the response of your ajax-call. if response is true, set all the binds, as the call should be ready by then
[13:06:34] <Delizin> lombriz: The second one sounds like the best option since I am calling ajax with a button click
[13:07:18] <duch_kazatel> don't bind handlers in callbacks btw.
[13:07:36] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I have this then? http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/
[13:07:36] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation.
[13:08:09] <duch_kazatel> Erryl some bad formatting there - missing a paren
[13:08:11] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/1/
[13:09:33] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Ah yeah, forgot the first {
[13:10:08] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: But if I click on a link now, it doesn't forward me to the page right?
[13:10:18] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Because of the preventDefault method
[13:10:48] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:12:04] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Hmm
[13:12:17] <duch_kazatel> we'll take care of that later.
[13:12:32] <Delizin> Hmm here are both of my functions http://jsfiddle.net/cBw7x/7/ . The top one is the initial ajax function, the bottom one is click binding. So I shouldn't just take the bottom one and put it in the request.done() part of the first one?
[13:15:28] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Aha ok, so now I have to add the class?
[13:16:53] <duch_kazatel> $(this) will be the link that was clicked
[13:17:19] <duch_kazatel> so you use .addClass() on $(this).
[13:17:36] <duch_kazatel> Delizin no.
[13:18:14] <Delizin> duch_kazatel: I am reading about event delegation and the on() function, but I am a complete javascript novice and not understanding it completely
[13:18:24] <duch_kazatel> one sec then
[13:18:50] <Delizin> Alright, thank you.
[13:19:25] <duch_kazatel> Delizin what's the parent container that you're loading into?>
[13:20:09] <Delizin> It is a <div class="panel-body">
[13:20:19] <duch_kazatel> and that exists on pageload, right?
[13:20:23] <Delizin> Yes
[13:20:31] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/2/ ?
[13:20:56] <duch_kazatel> Delizin http://jsfiddle.net/cBw7x/8/
[13:21:18] <duch_kazatel> Erryl http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/3/
[13:21:25] <duch_kazatel> and you need to give it a class.
[13:22:11] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I was a bit stuck with that, I don't know what to enter there
[13:22:20] <Delizin> duch_kazatel: Interesting, thank you
[13:22:56] <duch_kazatel> Erryl http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/4/
[13:23:55] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: And that class I have to define in css?
[13:24:46] <duch_kazatel> Erryl yup
[13:25:01] <duch_kazatel> Delizin events bubble up throuygh the document, so you can catch them on their way up.
[13:25:09] <duch_kazatel> this lets you trigger on dynamically loaded stuff easily.
[13:26:11] <Delizin> duch_kazatel: Good deal. Is it best practices to catch things as low as possible or is it acceptable to catch it at higher levels?
[13:27:18] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I have it like this now: http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/5/
[13:28:11] <duch_kazatel> rry you need to pass it using quotes instead
[13:28:20] <duch_kazatel> Delizin go as low as possible.
[13:28:47] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'll filter unnecessarily.
[13:29:53] <duch_kazatel> Erryl to it'd be http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/6/
[13:29:57] <duch_kazatel> *so it'd be
[13:30:19] <duch_kazatel> also with more cleanup: http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/7/
[13:31:03] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup, got that now
[13:31:52] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Should the link become purple now already?
[13:33:27] <duch_kazatel> Erryl well.. purple is a terrible color to choose since all blue links turn that color by default when clicked, soooo.
[13:33:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/LZB7c/9/
[13:34:28] <Delizin> duch_kazatel: Unfortunately not having any luck with this still. I can't get it working in the fiddle either, I've added the div panel, but the clicks aren't being recognized. http://jsfiddle.net/cBw7x/9/
[13:34:39] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Doesn't work, the links in the menu widget keep their original color
[13:35:01] <duch_kazatel> Erryl make sure you're matching spelling directly.
[13:35:15] <duch_kazatel> Delizin do you have your console open?
[13:35:41] <duch_kazatel> Delizin because I'm getting errors.
[13:37:48] <Delizin> duch_kazatel: Ah reports missing });, okay I'll give this another go round
[13:38:05] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Spelling is correct
[13:38:16] <phelix> how can i emulate a hover effect on an element. If I mouse over a specific element I am trying to make another element do the same effect as it woujld if I did the :hover in the css
[13:38:31] <phelix> so its set in css but need the javascript to force an element to have the hover state
[13:38:35] <duch_kazatel> Erryl and things are capitalized the same?
[13:38:38] <phelix> if that makes sense
[13:38:45] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Maybe it doesn't overwrite the original color from the original css file or something?
[13:38:47] <duch_kazatel> phelix you can use .trigger('hover') iirc.
[13:38:51] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup
[13:39:05] <duch_kazatel> Erryl did you even look at the working example I sent?
[13:39:07] <phelix> k let me try that thanks
[13:39:23] <duch_kazatel> phelix there are a few different ways.
[13:39:35] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I did, the one with the green link
[13:39:39] <phelix> will the .trigger('hover') not work?
[13:39:58] <duch_kazatel> phelix you might want to trigger mouseenter.
[13:40:01] <ankurk_> Erryl: try changing 'a' to 'li'
[13:40:02] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember which event it is.
[13:40:08] <phelix> yah the 'hover' doesn't work
[13:40:19] <ankurk_> Since menu widgets are based on <li> tags
[13:40:47] <phelix> mouseenter doesn't seem to work either
[13:41:10] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it then?
[13:41:14] <phelix> if the css has the desired effect that I want when you hover over it. Will just enabling the hover effect on that element still perform the same way?
[13:41:36] <duch_kazatel> phelix yes
[13:41:51] <duch_kazatel> phelix share your code?
[13:42:09] <Erryl> ankurk_: Nope, didn't do the trick, but you are right I use <li> indeed
[13:42:16] <phelix> not sure fiddle will work properly as the code is kinda complex. Can you view this url. http://eweandbrew.dev.tributemedia.com/ its the about button on the nav bar. When you mouseover it the arrow turns blue but on the items below it doesnt. I am trying to set if mouseover on those drop down arrows to keep the hover effect present on that blue arrow.
[13:42:41] <ankurk_> Erryl: you should share your HTML too, it might be problem with HTML
[13:43:24] <duch_kazatel> phelix generally you would create a small test-case in a fiddle, not the whole site.
[13:43:57] <phelix> yes I understand. Just not sure how to get all the appropiate stuff I'll need to get it into jsfiddle to get it working properly.
[13:44:04] <duch_kazatel> one sec, i'll show you.
[13:44:11] <phelix> thank you
[13:44:29] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: you're killing it today :P
[13:44:41] <duch_kazatel> hahaha nah.
[13:44:45] <duch_kazatel> just being cranky
[13:45:02] <Erryl> ankurk_ http://jsfiddle.net/KTqA8/
[13:45:23] <Erryl> ankurk_ That's my HTML
[13:47:22] <ankurk_> may be try with ('#menu li')?
[13:48:42] <duch_kazatel> phelix so the real problem is that you're triggering the event but it doesn't "hold" for you.  you'll need to look at using a class instead.  but this is the kind of fiddle you want to us: http://jsfiddle.net/5Nn6Q/
[13:48:44] <duch_kazatel> *use
[13:49:04] <Erryl> ankurk_ Nope doesnt work either, but the links don't turn purple either, because duch_kazatel said that was standard
[13:49:47] <phelix> k let me play with that.
[13:50:12] <phelix> So you think that i need to create a whole class to get this to work? Not sure I know that much about jquery to create a class.
[13:50:25] <duch_kazatel> phelix you add the class in your CSS.
[13:50:27] <duch_kazatel> not in jquery,.
[13:50:43] <duch_kazatel> you use the jquery addClass() and removeClass() methods.
[13:50:52] <duch_kazatel> or toggleClass() if you want to get weiurd.
[13:50:54] <duch_kazatel> *weird
[13:51:40] <phelix> ahh ok
[13:52:50] <Erryl> ankurk_: Maybe it's just the widget or something, why it doesn't work
[13:53:23] <ankurk_> Erryl: you can blame it on the widget too, can you try without widget?
[13:53:26] <duch_kazatel> Erryl what widget is this?
[13:53:35] <duch_kazatel> because they might be overriding your CSS.
[13:53:41] <bengalo> hey guys, i have a datepicker that binds to a form element. i show this form in an overlay using jquery ui modal dialog.. now when i click on the datepicker and then click anywhere else that is not the form, the datepicker closes (which is fine) but leaves the form input field selected (blinking cursor, dont know if this is intended/a bug/just form related). so when i click on the input field
[13:53:41] <bengalo> again, it wont open datepicker, just the normal autocomplete dropdown until i clicked somewhere in the form once (date field losing focus) and then on the input date field again.. do i have to use $(..).blur in the cancel trigger? am i missing something else?
[13:53:50] <ankurk_> Erryl: It can be, try without widget maybe?
[13:53:54] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: https://jqueryui.com/menu/
[13:54:22] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[13:54:26] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/Q8bzc/
[13:55:16] <duch_kazatel> Erryl you don't need to do that.  enable jqueryui in the fiddle instead.
[13:55:23] <ankurk_> jQuery UI can be a bitch sometimes
[13:55:41] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/kg6Wr1Y.png
[13:55:56] <duch_kazatel> set that dropdown, and then click the "jquery ui" box
[13:56:56] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I did
[13:58:06] <duch_kazatel> Erryl you just linked me to a fiddle with all the jqueryui css in it >.>
[13:59:40] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I mean I just did it :P
[13:59:48] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: When u told me to
[13:59:49] <duch_kazatel> lol ok
[14:00:08] <duch_kazatel> either way, jqui is going to be your problem.
[14:00:30] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: So it kinda is impossible, or atleast hard to do? :p
[14:00:41] <duch_kazatel> it's always possible.
[14:00:54] <duch_kazatel> you can use .css() instead.
[14:02:24] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: The one from jquerui?
[14:02:32] <duch_kazatel> from jquery.
[14:02:41] <duch_kazatel> .css('color', 'green')
[14:02:43] <duch_kazatel> or whatever.
[14:04:11] <duch_kazatel> we're watching the matrix in my office right now.
[14:04:13] <duch_kazatel> good times.
[14:04:14] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup that one works :D
[14:04:59] <duch_kazatel> that edits the direct css properties instead of adding a class.
[14:05:02] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: But now we used the preventDefault to it doesn't send through
[14:05:21] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Ah I see, pretty handy to use I think
[14:05:31] <Erryl> Erryl: Especially with this widget
[14:06:07] <duch_kazatel> Erryl are you wanting the default action to run?
[14:06:15] <duch_kazatel> because you didn't need jquery for any of this.
[14:06:49] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Well yeah, I want the link to work and change color after clicking
[14:07:11] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Because that didn't happen
[14:07:19] <duch_kazatel> Erryl then use CSS dude
[14:07:23] <duch_kazatel> instead of javascript
[14:08:15] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I kinda feel stupid now lol
[14:08:20] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Sorry :p
[14:08:51] <duch_kazatel> Erryl there's active, hover, visited, etc.
[14:09:08] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup, have that page infront of me now
[14:09:25] <duch_kazatel> http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/
[14:09:32] <duch_kazatel> btw, if you're on w3schools, don't use it.
[14:10:19] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yeah I heared that from other people too, what is wrong with it?
[14:10:36] <duch_kazatel> it's often wrong.
[14:10:42] <duch_kazatel> incomplete, inconsistent, bad, etc.
[14:10:47] <jphase> MDN ftw :D
[14:10:49] <duch_kazatel> if you want jquery info, learn to use the jquery docs.
[14:10:54] <duch_kazatel> if you want anything else, use MDN
[14:11:33] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yeah I used the docs a bit already, for applying the menu widget etc
[14:12:21] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the other sources, I'm going to take a break now, thanks for the help! :)
[14:12:31] <jphase> duch_kazatel is basically like a usage database as well though, so you can always ask him hehe
[14:12:52] <Erryl> jphase: Haha
[14:13:02] <duch_kazatel> hah.  nah.  i've just been around the block for a while.
[14:14:08] <duch_kazatel> almost made a full circle, too.
[14:14:27] <Intii> Hey all, I'm using superscrollorama and am having some trouble with linking the navbar to go to the correct places. Can anyone please help me? http://198.199.68.66/element18-animate/#\
[14:14:30] <duch_kazatel> the real trick with frontend development is to know which tools are right for which jobs.
[14:15:04] <Hyperking> how do I initialize a google maps with ajax?
[14:16:23] <decx> you mean asynchronous?
[14:16:46] <Hyperking> yeah..i guess so. here is my code
[14:16:48] <Hyperking> http://bpaste.net/show/C8BFqGsHeYfe3tScx1hl/
[14:17:41] <decx> consult gMap docs?
[14:18:00] <decx> or use the api directly, it's not witchcraft you know https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/
[14:18:11] <iamjarvo> is there an event for highlighting?
[14:18:37] <iamjarvo> i am using mouseup but it seems to be triggering on clicking also
[14:18:41] <duch_kazatel> probably not, but you could hook into mousedown, mouse move, and mouseup
[14:18:57] <iamjarvo> i was thinking of tracking time with mouse down
[14:19:00] <iamjarvo> and mouse up
[14:19:11] <duch_kazatel> click is apart of that cycle
[14:19:17] <Hyperking> decx: I have, nothing about async loading
[14:19:34] <tsukasa__> hey guys, i kind of suck at javascript debugging i'm looking for a tool to sort through this mess of a codebase
[14:19:40] <tsukasa__> i'd like to take a div and like put a breakpoint on it of sorts
[14:19:44] <tsukasa__> so that when javascript interacts with that element i see what functions are changing it and where they come from
[14:19:46] <tsukasa__> is there some browser plugin that will let me do this?
[14:20:11] <duch_kazatel> tsukasa__ sure, all of them.
[14:20:24] <duch_kazatel> tsukasa__ what browser are you in?
[14:20:26] <tsukasa__> duch_kazatel i know how to breakpoint a javascript line, how do you breakpoint a div
[14:20:37] <tsukasa__> duch_kazatel chrome. i have firefox and firebug as well
[14:20:40] <duch_kazatel> tsukasa__ what browser are you in?
[14:20:51] <duch_kazatel> i know how in firuebug.
[14:21:22] <tsukasa__> duch_kazatel how is that?
[14:21:27] <NoiseEee> tsukasa__: what does 'breakpoint a div' even mean?
[14:21:29] <duch_kazatel> right click the node in the html view.
[14:21:36] <duch_kazatel> he wants to stop execution.
[14:21:48] <NoiseEee> when something about the div is changed?
[14:21:56] <duch_kazatel> right click the node in the html view and look at the "break on..." options.
[14:22:47] <Hyperking>  decx: i would guess gMap(); but its not a function, so after I made It a function the error says function not defined
[14:22:53] <tsukasa__> duch_kazatel man thank you. that is awesome
[14:23:42] <decx> Hyperking i checked gmap and the plugin is using the old maps api, just use codeexample for async loading from the link it posted
[14:24:09] <duch_kazatel> tsukasa__ of course.
[14:25:24] <krambiorix> hi, what am i doing wrong? '<option id="'+data.id+'">'+'Boeking #'+$("#boekingsid").find("option").length+'</option>'.insertAfter('#boekingsid .newboekingoption');  -> boekingsid is a select box... I get:  "</option>".insertAfter is not a function
[14:28:07] <systemfault> You cannot call .insertAfter on a string
[14:28:35] <krambiorix> systemfault, how can i solve this then?
[14:28:44] <decx> is that a find inside a string?
[14:28:56] <decx> does that even work?
[14:28:58] <systemfault> You can use $(string) to create elements.
[14:29:10] <systemfault> But yeah.. that code is like ultra-awful
[14:29:46] <krambiorix> systemfault, why awful?
[14:30:36] <systemfault> krambiorix: Mainly because you're doing a .find() in the middle of building a string
[14:31:05] <ballsDeep> Good evening folks
[14:31:19] <krambiorix> systemfault, yeah i took that out
[14:31:24] <krambiorix> i put it in a var
[14:31:25] <systemfault> krambiorix: I hope you're not doing that in a loop
[14:31:25] <ballsDeep> I like coming here for the fact that I get to speak with some really talented programmers
[14:31:34] <krambiorix> systemfault, nope
[14:31:35] <ballsDeep> but I don't like the fact that I'm troubled with jquery
[14:31:39] <systemfault> krambiorix: Good :)
[14:31:42] <ballsDeep> in any event ...
[14:31:58] <ballsDeep> I'm using autocomplete and have html in a result
[14:32:08] <ballsDeep> simple code, nothing complicated
[14:32:20] <Hyperking> decx: thanks. I needed to make it a global variable in my html. before it would load the map but not the location data
[14:32:20] <ballsDeep> I just need to render the html
[14:33:10] <ballsDeep> hello ..
[14:33:11] <krambiorix> systemfault, thanks!
[14:33:27] <ballsDeep> ahoy oy ..
[14:33:56] <ballsDeep> hello
[14:34:27] <ballsDeep> I'll tell a joke if someone can give me some advice on my problem here ..
[14:36:21] <ballsDeep> ok ... I can see this isn't that type of party ...
[14:37:42] <decx> he didnt even ask the question
[14:38:04] <decx> 'i have a problem' .. 'oh nobody helps me' ... 'bye'
[14:46:39] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah freenode.
[14:52:22] <maxmoore14> I have a custom widget that creates an element, inserts it into the DOM, adds an event handler to the 'tap' event
[14:53:07] <maxmoore14> I have an edge case where I want to go in after the widget has been fully created, find the element in the DOM and remove the handler
[14:53:34] <maxmoore14> I'm good up to the point where removing the handler is doing nothing
[14:53:37] <nhulea_nsa> ballsdeep what the hell kinda of user name is that
[14:54:02] <nhulea_ballsdeep> actually I kinda like it
[14:54:49] <maxmoore14> anyone know if there is a special case when events are created by widgets?
[14:55:06] <maxmoore14> can I not simply use .off('tap') ?
[14:55:07] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 nope.  .off should work.
[14:55:46] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: so weird. cause I am confirming through the console that I have selected the right element
[14:56:06] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 did you double-check the .off docs?
[14:57:13] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: yeah, it looks good I think
[14:57:19] <duch_kazatel> share code?
[14:57:28] <maxmoore14> yeah, I can try....
[14:57:37] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle :D
[14:57:54] <maxmoore14> no, I know, just about reducing to reasonable sample
[14:58:00] <duch_kazatel> ok
[15:07:30] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/yehadoja/1/edit
[15:07:49] <maxmoore14> not a working example, but maybe you will see an obvious flaw...
[15:10:42] <duch_kazatel> one sec.  reformatting your code.
[15:12:38] <duch_kazatel> $.find() looks wrong to me
[15:14:01] <duch_kazatel> try $(document).find(
[15:17:32] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/yehadoja/3/edit
[15:17:51] <maxmoore14> closer to a working example, throwing a syntax error though
[15:18:58] <duch_kazatel> and you tried console.log(page.find('.test')), right?
[15:19:55] <maxmoore14> yep
[15:20:34] <duch_kazatel> and you're getting the right element?
[15:20:49] <maxmoore14> yeah
[15:22:35] <maxmoore14> I wonder if the widget factory is adding the event to a different element so that it can be removed upon destory automatically
[15:24:03] <maxmoore14> like it might be storing the event on the main widget element and using logic to route events to subobjects
[15:24:13] <maxmoore14> I know _on and _off do something like thta
[15:24:36] <maxmoore14> but I would have thought since I manually create the element and use "on" without the underscore, it would be ok
[15:25:07] <duch_kazatel> it should.
[15:28:31] <shoky> maxmoore14: working fine here after i gave your widget name a namespace  http://jsfiddle.net/HaU6k/
[15:30:01] <maxmoore14> shoky: yeah, thanks
[15:30:13] <maxmoore14> that helps - sort of
[15:30:22] <maxmoore14> cause I do use a namespace in my real widget
[15:30:39] <maxmoore14> but that tells me something unrelated is the issue
[15:31:10] <maxmoore14> thanks both
[15:33:28] <duch_kazatel> s'what we do.
[15:39:29] <ianclark001> Lo all, I'm looking for a link describing how to use the selector syntax to create DOM elements? I wanted to comment on some code that failing to provide closing tags is bad practice (I have seen this elsewhere), but I want to provide a link to the docs. I can't seem to find anything in the API
[15:39:51] <duch_kazatel> "how to use the selector syntax to create DOM elements?"
[15:39:55] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't exist.
[15:40:09] <ianclark001> Sorry, to be specific, $("<div></div>")
[15:40:33] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[15:40:35] <ianclark001> I say "selector" syntax because it is
[15:40:43] <duch_kazatel> no, it's not.
[15:40:45] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[15:40:58] <duch_kazatel> that's not a selector - jquery determines whether or not you want a selector.
[15:41:22] <ianclark001> duch_kazatel: OK
[15:41:49] <duch_kazatel> but you don't have to supply the closing tag in that case when it's a quick one liner.
[15:41:50] <duch_kazatel> iirc
[15:42:13] <ianclark001> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the link, I've run into problems when not providing closing tags in the past
[15:42:16] <maxmoore14_> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/BPUy8/
[15:42:43] <duch_kazatel> ianclark001 that's unusual.  were the documents valid?
[15:43:01] <ianclark001> I believe so, leme see if I can find a link
[15:43:34] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i meant that you can self-close.
[15:43:46] <duch_kazatel> $('<div />')
[15:44:13] <maxmoore14> shoky: all I really did was change to jqm 1.3.2 instead of 1.3.1
[15:46:03] <acidjazz> you konw what would blow my mind
[15:46:08] <acidjazz> what would be awesome as fuckkkk
[15:46:12] <ianclark001> duch_kazatel: This is what I was looking for: "To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the snippet must be well-formed.  Tags that can contain other elements should be paired with a closing  tag:"
[15:46:29] <acidjazz> if jquery could recgonize and parse JSON coming from a URL mixed w/ non-json and just ignore the non-json
[15:46:36] <duch_kazatel> teag,
[15:46:46] <duch_kazatel> *yeah
[15:50:19] <maxmoore14> shoky: nope, that's not it. changed back to 1.3.1 and still got it to fail now
[15:54:51] <maxmoore14> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/BPUy8/2/
[16:02:30] <maxmoore14> shoky: got disconnected, still there?
[16:02:33] <maxmoore14> http://jsfiddle.net/BPUy8/2/
[16:07:17] <shoky> ya
[16:08:38] <shoky> maxmoore14: first of all you don't have a class="test"
[16:09:01] <shoky> maxmoore14: actually that's it ;p
[16:27:34] <Intii> Can anyone please help me with superscrollorama and navigation links?
[16:27:46] <duch_work_beer> !ask @ intii
[16:27:46] <b-ot> intii: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:28:42] <Intii> I can't get the navigation items to scroll to the correct place while using superscrollorama
[16:28:57] <duch_work_beer> !paste @ Intii
[16:28:57] <b-ot> Intii: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:29:00] <duch_work_beer> :)
[16:29:06] <duch_work_beer> otherwise we have no idea what you're doing.
[16:29:13] <Intii> http://198.199.68.66/element18-animate/#
[16:29:20] <Intii> duch_work_beer: Easier if I just link the website
[16:29:27] <Intii> I can link to the script file too if you would like
[16:29:28] <duch_work_beer> for you maybe.
[16:29:34] <duch_work_beer> what specifically is broken?
[16:29:41] <Intii> Click on Contact for example
[16:29:53] <Intii> See how it doesn't go to the help you section?
[16:29:53] <duch_work_beer> okay.
[16:29:57] <duch_work_beer> it does.
[16:30:09] <Intii> Serious?
[16:30:12] <duch_work_beer> i am now looking at the section titled "How Can we Help You?"
[16:30:20] <Intii> When you click contact at the top?
[16:30:25] <duch_work_beer> yes
[16:30:42] <Intii> And the page is scrolled all the way to the top when you click on it?
[16:31:11] <duch_work_beer> click on what?
[16:31:33] <Intii> duch_work_beer: Are you using FF?
[16:31:37] <duch_work_beer> yup
[16:31:44] <Intii> Okay, I just tried in FF and it works
[16:31:47] <Intii> It doesn't in Chrome though
[16:31:59] <duch_work_beer> are you changing the height on anything during all your scroll animations?
[16:32:18] <duch_work_beer> yeah you are.
[16:32:20] <duch_work_beer> that's your issue.
[16:32:48] <Intii> I know
[16:32:52] <Intii> I just don't know how to fix it
[16:32:58] <Intii> I get the offset of the div
[16:33:12] <Intii> But on Chrome, it just gets stuck at the who we are section
[16:33:28] <duch_work_beer> right because you keep adding height.
[16:33:57] <Intii> okay, new question then! how come it works correctly in FF and not in Chrome
[16:34:03] <duch_work_beer> you need to offset for all of the added height.
[16:34:04] <duch_work_beer> and no clue.
[16:34:21] <duch_work_beer> i wouldn't be dynamically adding height like that tbh.
[16:34:28] <Intii> I don't do it
[16:34:34] <tw2113> Cork, gnarf what are some document sites that you really like?
[16:34:41] <duch_work_beer> your animations are.
[16:34:41] <Intii> Its superscrollorama. When you pin a div it adds height
[16:34:42] <tw2113> shoky too
[16:34:59] <duch_work_beer> that's going to be part of your problem.
[16:36:00] <Intii> duch_work_beer: So just getting the offset isn't enough?
[16:36:23] <duch_work_beer> dunno - I can't find documentation on superscrollspy, just scrollspy.
[16:36:52] <Intii> http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/
[16:37:15] <duch_work_beer> why not use scrollmagic?
[16:37:45] <Intii> I found out about it after I did all my animations :(
[16:37:49] <Intii> Would it be hard to switch over?
[16:38:00] <duch_work_beer> dunno.
[16:38:09] <duch_work_beer> i don't do these crazyass animations like this.
[16:38:25] <Intii> Clients choice haha :)
[16:38:51] <duch_work_beer> either way, you'll need to get the offset and increase it by the pinned divs.
[16:39:32] <Intii> I'm reading up on scrollmagic right now, since it uses Tweenmax, I don't think it'll be too hard to switch over since all the animations are done in TweenMax
[16:49:28] <nhulea_ballsdeep> you guys every look at the word click and think it says dick?
[16:49:43] <nhulea_ballsdeep> ever*
[16:49:58] <tw2113> kerning is important
[16:50:40] <nhulea_ballsdeep> Intii: what are you making ? could this be useful https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr
[16:52:23] <Intii> nhulea_ballsdeep: I looked into that and couldn't make heads or tails out of it
[16:52:26] <Intii> So I moved on haha
[16:52:40] <nhulea_ballsdeep> oh I can help I have used it a couple of time s
[16:53:40] <nhulea_ballsdeep> initt
[16:54:20] <Intii> nhulea_ballsdeep: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. If I wasn't so pressed on time I would ask for your help, but since scrollmagic uses the GSAP libraries, it'll be easier for me to switch over to that for the time being
[17:02:16] <nhulea> Intii: ok you got it !
[17:03:26] <nhulea> tw2113: yeah there is a guy who comes around sometimes in here and the nick is pomlife and I always think his name is pornlife its the strangest thing my eyes must be going
[17:03:43] <duch_work_beer> hahaha
[17:04:47] <nhulea> yeah and the ballsdeep guy earlier that was hilarious he comes actin tough then just leaves hahah
[17:05:05] <nhulea> I mean seriously ballsdeep what the hell is that ?
[17:05:14] <duch_work_beer> it's awesome.
[17:05:32] <tw2113> allegedly a good place to be
[17:06:22] <nhulea> i mean is that the overall user name I am going google "ballsdeep" and see if I can find who it is ....
[17:06:42] <nhulea> oh wait ... not what i thought hahaha
[17:07:50] <nhulea> hey is there a way to speed up canvas.todataurl ? would there be any benifit to increasing ram or something like that ?
[17:12:43] <gnarf> tw2113: document sites?
[17:12:54] <tw2113> documentation sites
[17:13:13] <ankurk_> so duch_kazatel is now duch_work_beer?
[17:13:21] <tw2113> gnarf, good example would be http://api.jquery.com/
[17:13:36] <tw2113> i'm looking up and trying to find inspiration for a documentation site i contribute to
[17:13:44] <nhulea> alright see guys in an hour or 2
[17:14:19] <gnarf> tw2113 oh - yeah, all of them are pretty terrible... :)
[17:14:22] <gnarf> i kind of like http://lodash.com/docs#difference
[17:15:07] <tw2113> thanks, will look it over
[17:16:10] <tw2113> that's a big one-page site
[17:24:29] <tw2113> better question gnarf if you're still around. What would YOU want to see on a documentation site
[17:24:44] <tw2113> where could everyone do better
[17:25:02] <gnarf> tw2113: honestly, if it stays up to date and is easily searched, i could care less
[17:25:13] <gnarf> accuracy is hard to acheive
[17:25:24] <tw2113> agreed
[17:25:40] <tw2113> i do already employ timestamps for last edited
[17:48:49] <Intii> So I'm  using ScrollMagic now, how come my divs pin in the middle of the screen?
[17:51:29] <back2basics> I'm trying to add tags onto a content item using a form button within a form.  I want to leave it freeform so the person can leave as many tags as they want. Each tag has some attributes things like "optional" and "completed level #9" etc.. I'm adding them as buttons from bootcamp with hidden values so it works in the form.  Is this Sane?  or is there a better way to do this?  This just seems overly complex.
[18:02:14] <Intii> Hello?
[18:02:32] <dandrews> hi
[18:02:56] <dandrews> lol
[18:03:46] <Intii> rofl
[18:04:05] <Intii> ScrollMagic pins my content in the center of the screen, I don't know how to fix it :(
[18:04:43] <Intii> http://198.199.68.66/element18-animate/#
[18:05:04] <dandrews> interesting
[18:05:53] <dandrews> your network is just filling with tons of images
[18:07:08] <Intii> Yeah, it's pretty image heavy
[18:07:23] <visua> i would say so
[18:07:37] <dandrews> I would load them dynamically
[18:07:40] <visua> man, superslides is giving me a headache as well
[18:07:50] <visua> http://www.michaelnovia.net/dev/#1
[18:07:53] <Intii> dandrews: How?
[18:08:07] <visua> trying to write a custom transition in the fx class and blaaah its a pain
[18:09:04] <dandrews> just load like 20 images, and detect when the users body.scrollTop + window.height touches like #15, and load 20 more
[18:09:28] <Intii> Okay, but most of the images are for the portfolio section when press the "Go" button
[18:09:35] <Intii> it starts a slideshow
[18:10:50] <dandrews> could you not load those images until that button is clicked?
[18:11:08] <dandrews> (or when the user hovers over the button, or is within 500px from that button?) ;)
[18:11:21] <Intii> How would I do that sir?
[18:11:24] <dandrews> or must they be loaded right away.
[18:11:30] <dandrews> ?*
[18:11:42] <Intii> Well the images are loaded via PHP
[18:12:12] <dandrews> $('REFERENCE TO "GO" BUTTON HERE').on('click', function(evt) {});
[18:12:47] <dandrews> ah I see.
[18:12:55] <visua> ajax then?
[18:12:59] <dandrews> yup
[18:13:07] <visua> :]
[18:13:10] <dandrews> make a web service to call for the images.
[18:13:43] <Intii> Okay I'll work on that after
[18:13:55] <Intii> I just need this ScrollMagic thing to work and I'm golden!
[18:13:58] <dandrews> I have a feeling thats part of the reason why it 'catches'
[18:14:15] <Intii> The images loading?
[18:14:30] <dandrews> that's what your having problems with right? the scroll stopping halfway down the page?
[18:15:08] <Intii> Well it's supposed to stop at the top of the window and do an animation and continue scrolling. Instead of having it stop at the top, it stops half way through
[18:16:38] <dandrews> ah, I'm not familiar with scroll magic, whats your code look like?
[18:18:15] <Intii> http://pastebin.com/CxJ3D8sf
[18:18:33] <Intii> You can check script.js, but I pasted the specific code in that pastebin
[18:24:57] <dandrews> I feel like you should use 0.5 or parseFloat('.'5') instead of .5 ;
[18:25:30] <visua> I think the correct way to write a new animation on this is to extend the .fx prototype or whatever its called
[18:25:37] <visua> but man..what a cluster fuck that is
[18:26:01] <visua> So i'm like..trying to hijack the events and do it my own way..wich is also a pain in the ass
[18:26:28] <Intii> Are you guys talking to me?
[18:26:37] <dandrews> I'm talking to you Intii
[18:26:40] <visua> I was not.
[18:26:44] <visua> I'm just venting
[18:27:11] <dandrews> whats your prob visua?
[18:27:32] <visua> dandrews well, not really a 'problem' I guess.
[18:27:38] <Intii> dandrews: Where do I put that?
[18:27:50] <visua> dandrews http://www.michaelnovia.net/dev/#
[18:28:02] <visua> I want to write custom transitions before the slider fires it's slide action
[18:28:15] <visua> So i can animate the ui out, slide, animate the ui back in.
[18:28:19] <dandrews> cool design man
[18:28:22] <visua> Thanks :)
[18:28:35] <visua> I'm using superslides as my base
[18:29:10] <visua> And trying to extend it a bit, it has a way to write custom fx class, but i'm unable to get that working correctly,.
[18:29:21] <dandrews> Intii, where it says .5 in your code
[18:29:35] <visua> So, it has an api like $('#slides').superslides('next');  - but this doesn't seem to fire the event to goto the next slide
[18:29:40] <dandrews> I don't think thats the problem, but I'm pretty sure that's the 'proper' way
[18:30:25] <visua> I want to do something pretty snazzy on transition, so i'm just trying to experiment or control the animation state before it fires 'next' or previous.
[18:30:48] <dandrews> I see
[18:30:55] <dandrews> they don't have an onbeforeprevious event?
[18:31:13] <visua> https://github.com/nicinabox/superslides
[18:31:45] <visua> Not entirely :P
[18:31:46] <visua> oh wait
[18:31:51] <visua> I can use the .animate call I think
[18:31:52] <visua> !!
[18:35:09] <dandrews> work?
[18:36:23] <visua> Ah i got distracted by a text message haha
[18:36:32] <dandrews> lol
[18:36:36] <visua> let me give it a shot, it will take some reworking
[18:36:47] <visua> I gotta get rid of the href="#1" and stuff
[18:40:23] <dandrews> yeah doesn't it handle it for you? visua
[18:40:44] <visua> Sure does. But i'm removing all the built in nav
[18:40:50] <visua> and like overiding it with my own functions
[18:40:58] <dandrews> ah gotcha
[18:41:18] <visua> I want the left/right to run my function instead of the plugins
[18:41:25] <visua> so i can animate all the things!
[18:41:31] <visua> and yeah it worked :D
[18:41:46] <dandrews> sweet :)
[18:47:52] <visua> i def. broke it
[18:47:56] <visua> son of a bitch lol
[18:48:34] <dandrews> lmao whats happening?
[18:48:50] <visua> Hmm..it would be diffuclt to explain the behaviour
[18:48:51] <visua> let me push it
[18:50:23] <visua> http://www.michaelnovia.net/dev/
[18:50:43] <visua> The first slide will goto the second slide, but if you hit next after that, it just goes back to the home
[18:50:47] <visua> or first slide, rather.
[18:51:35] <dandrews> I see
[18:51:54] <dandrews> what file is this in?
[18:52:06] <visua> http://www.michaelnovia.net/dev/assets/js/app.js
[18:52:21] <visua> yikes that formatting looks pretty effed.
[18:53:45] <dandrews> .bind is deprecated btw
[18:54:00] <visua> I didn't know that.
[18:54:46] <dandrews> mhm. and for further optimization you can make a var body = $('body'), and use body instead of having to query the dom each time
[18:54:54] <dandrews> you can also chain your events :)
[18:55:54] <dandrews> AND $(function() {}); is the same thing as $(document).ready(function(){});
[18:55:55] <visua> okay, i've implemented the body variable.
[18:56:54] <visua> Just as a caution, im a designer not a dev – so my style is very much duct-tape development haha
[18:57:22] <dandrews> so having $(function() {}); inside of $(document).ready() is repetitive
[18:57:34] <dandrews> you only need one. I'd recommend $(function() {}) as its concise :)
[18:57:54] <visua> Ah right i'm dumb.
[18:58:18] <dandrews> I'll edit the file for you real quick so you can see; & i'll also check for the potential problem too; & I'm sure you're not dumb, you're just not a developer :p
[18:58:42] <visua> haha well thanks for that encouragement
[19:01:01] <visua> hmm..i appear to have broken it somehow.
[19:04:10] <visua> ok haha i see what i did.
[19:08:44] <dandrews> http://pastebin.com/i6ZdY0xK try this out, push it, and let me know; I don't think it solves your problem, but i added some debug messages, and formatted it really nicely for you
[19:09:25] <visua> ok, i'll try it.
[19:09:27] <visua> http://pastebin.com/q7DEv1z9
[19:09:31] <visua> also - here's mine.
[19:09:38] <visua> a little bit cleaner, no? and it's working.
[19:10:21] <visua> Any reason you prefix the variables with $
[19:10:33] <dandrews> make sure to specify var before ALL your variables.
[19:10:43] <dandrews> if you don't , they are put on the window, and pollute the global namespace
[19:11:03] <visua> Alright, that makes sense.
[19:11:28] <dandrews> and $[name here] is just a naming convention to be able to tell right away whether something is a jquery collection or not. its not required, just a 'good practice' in the jquery community
[19:11:56] <visua> okay, that's a great tip.
[19:11:57] <visua> :)
[19:12:03] <visua> Thanks for this, it's extremely helpful.
[19:12:08] <thepro4ever> hello, does anyone see anything syntactically wrong with this line of code?  $('div').mouseleave('fast', 0.5);
[19:12:38] <dandrews> np man
[19:12:55] <shoky> thepro4ever not syntactically but that's wrong.. mouseleave is an event handler
[19:14:50] <visua> Ahhh man
[19:14:56] <visua> this code is so much cleaner and easier to understand too.
[19:26:54] <visua> Hmm..still having the yo-yo issue
[19:27:03] <visua> can't get past slide 2, it just slides back to 1
[19:33:07] * Velveeta poofs into existence on top of some boxes, playing with a yo-yo, and says "yo-yo issue, eh?" then flips down off of the boxes and flourishes a cape, saying "then you've come to the right place, good sir..."
[19:33:39] <visua> lol
[19:34:15] <Velveeta> what kind of yo-yo issue? got a fiddle i can look at?
[19:34:51] <visua> Sure I can make one, let me push my project so you can check it out
[19:34:57] <Velveeta> ok
[19:34:57] <drnick_naeluh> Velveeta: how do you do italics I cant figure it out ?
[19:35:14] <Velveeta> drnick_noeluh: <em> ?
[19:35:19] <Velveeta> or are you talking about in here?
[19:35:27] <drnick_naeluh> yea irc
[19:35:45] <Velveeta> on my irc client it doesn't get italicized, that must just be your client, but that form of statement is done by using "/me" in place of your name
[19:35:51] <Velveeta> like: /me demonstrates this now.
[19:35:54] * Velveeta demonstrates this now.
[19:36:07] * drnick_naeluh i think i got it
[19:36:16] * drnick_naeluh thanks Velveeta
[19:36:36] <visua> Velveeta http://www.michaelnovia.net/dev/
[19:36:41] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[19:36:54] <visua> http://pastie.org/8813836
[19:36:58] <visua> here's my js
[19:37:11] * drnick_naeluh puts on hat and tips back
[19:37:15] <visua> lol
[19:37:37] <visua> So it goes to slide #2, and if you click next on that slide it just goes back to the first slide, rather than going to the next slide.
[19:37:57] <Velveeta> what's all this superslides/tweenlite stuff?
[19:38:11] <visua> superslides is the slider i'm using, and tweenlite is the animation library
[19:39:27] <Velveeta> so is the yo-yo effect you're referring to just the fact that when i click next from slide 2, it goes back to slide 1?
[19:39:41] <visua> correct
[19:40:19] <visua> So, something is borked with my code, likely line 22
[19:40:45] <drnick_naeluh> you do have other slide correct ?
[19:40:51] <drnick_naeluh> slides?
[19:40:56] <visua> Indeed I do.
[19:41:18] <Velveeta> let me start dropping some breakpoints and see if i can figure out what's going on
[19:42:03] <visua> What i'm doing is preventing the default superslides behavior so that I can animate .ui stuff, and when that's finished fire the next event.
[19:42:23] <visua> If you use the keyboard, it works fine since that is the default superslides behaviour, however then it does not run my animation code.
[19:42:36] <visua> I hope that makes some sense, somehow :)
[19:45:06] <drnick_naeluh> why dont you have  evt.preventDefault(); in your function ?
[19:45:26] <visua> because I didn't know I needed it.
[19:45:51] <drnick_naeluh> I think its running your code and the default code at the same time maybe ?
[19:46:22] <visua> shiiiit
[19:46:23] <drnick_naeluh> is there something in superslides that adds preventdefault to it ?
[19:46:24] <visua> that fixed it dude.
[19:46:25] <visua> :)
[19:46:36] <drnick_naeluh> oh cool
[19:46:53] <Velveeta> huzzah!
[19:46:55] <visua> thanks.
[19:46:59] <drnick_naeluh> hell yeah
[19:47:01] <drnick_naeluh> !!
[19:47:03] <visua> Didn't even think of that :P
[19:47:26] <visua> Ok sweet. Now I can get into the fun part of actually doing some cool animations haha.
[19:47:35] <drnick_naeluh> dude I didnt even think of that until you said "What i'm doing is preventing the default superslides behavior so that I can animate .ui stuff, and when that's finished fire the next event."
[19:48:00] <visua> :D
[19:48:03] <drnick_naeluh> haha
[19:48:17] <visua> i really need to fix that headline svg on the homepage
[19:48:22] <visua> its super shitty atm.
[19:49:49] <drnick_naeluh> yeah just watch out svgs are really weird on ie they do some weird stuff so make sure you check for sure and this article has some useful info on how to fix it http://css-tricks.com/using-svg/
[19:54:46] <visua> I'll check it out
[19:54:55] <visua> I mean..im not entirely sure i care about ie haha.
[20:03:43] <drnick_naeluh> yeah its really fucked cause its awesome when it works everywhere
[21:18:37] <Ziggy`> When using the following -> element.on('click.delegateEventsView1 touchend.delegateEventsView1', '.action', function(e) {}); It somehow always triggers both touchend and click on mobile. can I somehow only trigger the first one ? I've tried using e.stopPropagation() with no luck.
[21:21:44] <Ziggy`> Am I doing something wrong?
[21:29:35] <Ziggy`> Should I just be doing preventDefault(); ?
[21:42:05] <Ziggy`> Anyone?
[22:05:01] <CarlFK> http://api.jquery.com/click/  how can I get where (in x,y) on an image the click hit?
[22:10:47] <Snerf> CarlFK, function(e), and use e.clientX and Y, and probably an offset for the actual image
[22:11:23] <CarlFK> Snerf: thanks.. I figured it was something like that
[22:11:32] <Snerf> pretty simple
[22:12:23] <CarlFK> http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/ theres examples
[22:12:58] <Snerf> ya, pageX and clientX are different tho
[22:13:21] <Snerf> but ya , that'll get ya going
[22:40:32] <drnick_naeluh> i need to make my js code  run faster is there a way to run some kinda optimization filter to see where I am going wrong ?
[22:54:36] <denbatte> Hi alll. I have a JSON array [{"id":"1","name":"Bart","topScore":"15"},{...}, ...] How do I itterate trough it getting each name?
[22:54:55] <denbatte> I am always getting errors
[22:56:32] <systemfault> Is it JSON or a JS object?
[22:56:39] <systemfault> How do you load the data?
[22:59:25] <denbatte> Its Json retrieved from a database with a ajax call
[23:00:13] <systemfault> Is it a string or an object?
[23:00:30] <systemfault> JSON is a string, JS is an Object
[23:00:48] <systemfault> What function do you use to retrieve the data?
[23:00:49] <denbatte> I think a string
[23:00:53] <denbatte> dont know exactly
[23:01:22] <systemfault> Do you have any code you can show us?
[23:01:24] <denbatte> $scoreList = Score::all()->toJson(); (it's laravel eloquent code)
[23:01:37] <systemfault> Then how do you load it? Using ajax?
[23:01:43] <denbatte> je
[23:01:44] <systemfault> What jQuery function do you use?
[23:01:45] <denbatte> yes
[23:01:53] <systemfault> $.getJSON?
[23:02:20] <denbatte> its a return from a $.post
[23:02:35] <denbatte> in the .done part
[23:03:59] <back2basics> why isn't this <a> not adding? http://jsfiddle.net/3CEPL/3/
[23:03:59] <denbatte> $.post("score").done(function(data) { console.log(data) } ..
[23:04:14] <systemfault> Anyway, if it's a JS object, you can do: $.each(myArray, function() { var name = this.name; });
[23:05:16] <systemfault> back2basics: What do you want to do?
[23:05:25] <denbatte> systemfault, and if it is a string?
[23:05:43] <systemfault> denbatte: var myObject = $.parseJSON(jsonhere);
[23:06:25] <back2basics> systemfault: I want to add a lot hidden input values to a form.  but I'm starting with an <a> tag .  I've distilled that to it's smallest form and it doesn't work.
[23:06:51] <hailwood> Hey guys, if I have two ajax requests that fire off when a select has it's value changed, I need to react once *both* the requests have come back.
[23:06:52] <hailwood> I was thinking to store their return value in variables that get cleared out before the ajax request gets fired, when the requests come back have them call a function which stores that return value and if both values are variables are set react then, Is that the best way to do this?
[23:07:11] <systemfault> hailwood: $.when
[23:08:04] <hailwood> systemfault: I am now super glad I asked :D
[23:08:07] <systemfault> var transaction1 = $.ajax(.........); var transaction2 = $.ajax(.....); $.when(transaction1, transaction2).done(function(results) {});
[23:08:08] <hailwood> Thank you
[23:08:21] <systemfault> You're welcome
[23:09:14] <hailwood> systemfault: am I mistaken, or would that actually be .done(function(t1result, t2result){...}) ?
[23:10:19] <systemfault> hailwood: IIRC, $.when returns an array
[23:10:27] <back2basics> systemfault: here is more of it http://jsfiddle.net/3CEPL/4/ if you were interested.
[23:11:41] <back2basics> systemfault: but when I view frame source, the hidden values don't show up.
[23:12:28] <systemfault> Well, there's a syntax error....
[23:13:17] <systemfault> If you need to have double-quotes inside a string delimited by double-quotes, you must escape them
[23:13:18] <denbatte> systemfault, thank you ... It was a JSON string. Now its working. Learned something
[23:13:25] <systemfault> denbatte: Great :D
[23:14:06] <hailwood> systemfault: Yeah if I am reading https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/#example-0 correctly, then each deffered passed to .when results as another array as a a param in to the callback in .done(), so it essentially ends up as .done(function([ data, statusText, jqXHR ], [ data, statusText, jqXHR ]){...}) if that makes sense
[23:14:12] <systemfault> denbatte: just saw that you can pass the dataType as a parameter of $.post
[23:14:36] <systemfault> denbatte: So instead of using $.parseJSON, try to pass 'json' as the last parameter of $.post
[23:14:52] <denbatte> I have
[23:14:57] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[23:14:57] <denbatte> still it's a string
[23:15:35] <systemfault> hailwood: Right, jQuery's promise implementation is a bit weak...
[23:15:50] <denbatte> systemfault, here is the code
[23:15:52] <denbatte> http://jsfiddle.net/tBTYq/
[23:15:57] <systemfault> hailwood: Other promise libs have a .spread function
[23:16:25] <systemfault> denbatte: Have you with with 'json' ? (lowercase)
[23:16:39] <denbatte> mmmm should that be it?
[23:16:42] <denbatte> ill try
[23:17:34] <systemfault> denbatte: If it works, you should be able to remove the $.parseJSON line
[23:17:47] <denbatte> it does not work
[23:17:50] <systemfault> Weird.
[23:18:04] <denbatte> Ill try to add the json in the fiddle ... sec
[23:19:26] <hailwood> systemfault: Ah right, well jQuery it is for now, our project already has jQuery, underscore.js, moment.js I don't really want to add more libraries :D
[23:19:40] <systemfault> hailwood: I totally understand :)
[23:20:20] <systemfault> hailwood: $.when.apply($, arrayOfPromises]) can be really useful btw
[23:21:07] <hailwood> systemfault: Any idea where I can find the docs on that?
[23:22:39] <systemfault> It's just an ordinary usage of the apply function
[23:36:17] <Aeq> Hi all! Can you check my first jquery plugin, and add some comments of my code at github? http://aeqdev.com/tools/js/abigimage/
[23:40:39] <felixjet> whats the event to manipulate a textarea when a key is pressed?
[23:40:44] <felixjet> .keypress() ? .keyup() ?
