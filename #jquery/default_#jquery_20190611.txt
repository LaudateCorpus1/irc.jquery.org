[08:26:54] <plzHelpM3> Can anyone point out where I’m going wrong here? I'm trying to wrap all the elements in a div starting with the occurrence of a '<p><strong/></p>'. This is what I’m working with/my failed scripts: https://codepen.io/plzHelpM3/pen/YozJPR and this is the desired result: https://codepen.io/plzHelpM3/pen/YozJYb
[08:39:22] <shoky> plzHelpM3: it's not working mainly because you are selecting the <strong> elements and looking for their siblings (but they have none)
[08:40:34] <shoky> plzHelpM3: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ydLQej  i separated it into 2 steps
[08:44:55] <shoky> this works too, without adding the target class  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ProxWp
[08:45:52] <shoky> (.andSelf was renamed to .addBack in some version)
[08:46:25] <Cork> 1.7 if i remember correctly
[08:46:37] <Cork> ah, nope 1.8
[08:47:14] <Cork> (not removed until 3.0 though)
[08:49:41] <plzHelpM3> Ahh i see. I figured it was an issue with targeting non-existent siblings but wasn't sure how to traverse the correct level of the tree. But thanks shoky!
[09:54:46] <VarunAgw> I want to select a tr, which has exactly 3 td childs. How do I do it?
[09:55:03] <VarunAgw> #('tr:has(td:eq(2))')
[10:22:51] <taplar> VarunAgw_ you're most likely going to have to multi step that operation.
[11:46:15] <Cork> VarunAgw: $('td:nth-child(3)').closest('tr')
[11:46:27] <Cork> that is the closest you can get
[11:46:49] <Cork> (no pun intended)
[11:46:57] <taplar> yeah, with that matching things that also had more than 3 cells
[11:47:34] <taplar> I was thinking more like $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).children().length === 3; })
[11:47:50] <Cork> though that said, if you need to select this often i would recommend adding a class to those trs
[11:48:12] <Cork> that will have to loop all trs though
[11:48:27] <Cork> and select all children of them
[11:48:40] <taplar> i mean, if he wants only the ones that have exactly 3, not sure how you'd avoid a loop
[11:48:56] <Cork> hmm
[11:50:05] <Cork> so $('td:nth-child(3)').closest('tr').not($('td:nth-child(4)').closest('tr'))
[11:50:11] <Cork> would still be more efficient
[11:50:35] <robertmaxrees> "efficient"??
[11:50:55] <taplar> wouldn't all the tr 'not' be a td though?
[11:51:02] <taplar> oh, missed the closest
[11:51:15] <taplar> *second
[11:51:19] <Cork> ya. but ya, the correct choice is still to just add a class
[11:52:19] <taplar> isn't there a :last-child selector?
[11:52:28] <Cork> ah...
[11:52:30] <Cork> point
[11:52:36] <taplar> td:nth-child(3):last-child ?
[11:52:39] <Cork> ya
[11:52:44] <Cork> +1
[11:53:31] <thykka> waaait
[11:53:41] <thykka> there's a perfect selector for the "exactly 3" part
[11:53:53] <thykka> td:nth-child(3):nth-last-child(1)
[11:54:02] <thykka> td:nth-child(3):last-child
[11:54:16] <taplar> ...
[11:54:18] <Cork> ya, exactly what taplar said...
[11:54:21] <thykka> oh
[11:54:23] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[11:54:24] <thykka> sorry, missed that
[11:54:25] <taplar> lol
[11:55:13] <thykka> https://codepen.io/thykka/pen/xzaQVm
[12:01:29] <Cork> that actually reminded me that csswg changed so :empty doesn
[12:01:42] <Cork> *'t check space
[12:02:17] <Cork> man oh man how many hacks i've had to write over the years cause of that *happy*
[12:02:49] <taplar> you mean :empty was false for space, or true?
[12:04:19] <Cork> <span> </span> span:empty {} didn't match
[12:04:37] <taplar> "Note: In Selectors Level 4 the :empty selector was changed to act like :-moz-only-whitespace, but no browsers currently support this yet."  Aaaah
[12:04:40] <Cork> it was changed in https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1967
[12:04:40] <taplar> interesting
[12:04:51] <Cork> about half a year ago
[12:05:03] <taplar> makes sense to me (that they fixed it)
[12:05:08] <Cork> ya
[12:05:15] <Cork> instead of creating :blank
[13:30:44] <geri> hi, i have a: <input type = "submit" value="test"/>  ... how can i disable the button as well as enable with jquery?
[13:31:08] <taplar> you can pro('disabled', true/false) the button
[13:31:14] <taplar> *prop()
[13:31:22] <geri> what is the button name/id to refer to?
[13:31:37] <taplar> there is no id/class on it so you'll have to figure out the selector
[13:31:52] <geri> hm
[13:32:34] <geri> can i set an id or class, that would help?
[13:32:38] <taplar> sure
[13:33:09] <geri> for example: <input type="submit" value="SNIFF" id='submitBtn'/>
[13:33:28] <geri> and than: $(#submitBtn).attr('disabled', false);
[13:33:29] <geri> ?
[13:33:44] <taplar> with quotes around the selector, and prop(), not attr()
[13:34:21] <geri> attr only works if i use: <input type="submit" value="SNIFF" class='submitBtn'/> ?
[13:34:44] <taplar> The element is already in the DOM, and the disabled is a property, so prop() works
[13:35:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ you generally want to favor .prop()
[13:38:34] <geri> taplar: ok that works, but the button does not look like disabled
[13:38:42] <geri> is there anything i can do about it?
[13:38:51] <robertmaxrees> show us :)
[13:38:58] <geri> usually the color changes
[13:39:02] <geri> like to grey
[13:39:14] <taplar> oh, your second html is a class
[13:39:17] <taplar> did you use a class or id
[13:39:28] <geri> id
[13:39:37] <taplar> and what is your command?
[13:40:55] <geri> <input type="submit" value="SNIFF" id="submitBtn"/>  .... $('.submitBtn').prop('disabled', true);
[13:41:08] <taplar> #id, .className
[13:45:36] <geri> taplar: where?
[13:45:47] <taplar> Your selector is wrong.
[13:45:56] <taplar> # denotes an id.  . denotes a class
[13:45:57] <geri> $('#submitBtn').prop('disabled', true);
[13:45:58] <geri> ?
[13:46:35] <robertmaxrees> if you're using id="submitBtn", yes
[13:49:15] <geri> robertmaxrees: does it matter if the submit is in a form?
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> not sure I follow.
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[13:51:17] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle.
[13:51:43] <geri> robertmaxrees: https://ideone.com/6WYKp7
[13:51:50] <geri> ok
[13:53:33] <robertmaxrees> so are you trying to prevent the form from submitting normally?
[13:54:21] <geri> yeah
[13:54:38] <geri> response need to be back than i can resubmit
[13:54:40] <robertmaxrees> you need to run the preventDefault method on the event object.
[13:54:56] <geri> i do?
[13:54:59] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:55:06] <geri> line 19
[13:55:44] <robertmaxrees> move that before everything else.
[13:55:47] <robertmaxrees> in case you have errors.
[13:56:12] <robertmaxrees> also your markup is invalid - you have an extra closing div tag.
[13:56:54] <robertmaxrees> and your post syntax is bad - it takes an object.
[13:57:09] <robertmaxrees> you're passing a bunch of you setting vars :)
[13:59:08] <geri> ok works
[13:59:12] <geri> i edited the wrong file lol
[13:59:16] <robertmaxrees> heh
