[00:06:55] <funkeesapien> hello
[00:07:43] <funkeesapien> i noticed i have two different versions of jquery linked in my source
[00:08:10] <funkeesapien> the one that gets called after takes precedence meaning i can remove the one before it right?
[00:17:31] <pavonia> funkeesapien: I would keep the more recent one
[00:42:13] <funkeesapien> pavonia: that's what i decided on too, thanks
[02:17:57] <jak2000> jquery: https://jsfiddle.net/j66p2fkw/   wich is bad? (see console please)
[02:19:33] <pavonia> Wrong link
[02:19:52] <Uhkis> -1 not enough jquery
[02:20:15] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/Loorzo7t/1/
[02:20:17] <jak2000> sorry
[02:20:20] <jak2000> check please
[02:22:03] <Uhkis> jak2000: there's not element with id "irRow"
[02:22:10] <Uhkis> idRow*
[02:22:58] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/Loorzo7t/2/
[02:23:09] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/7uqevd9g/
[02:23:36] <jak2000> why not work mine?
[02:23:53] <Uhkis> that one has no jquery included
[02:25:15] <jak2000> ok i see
[02:25:39] <jak2000> Uhkis know about bootstrap dialog forms?
[02:27:55] <Uhkis> yes
[02:28:21] <jak2000> see please (pastebin)
[02:28:39] <Uhkis> not gonna check any pastebin.com links, sorry
[02:28:42] <IamTrying> How to use speech? var msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(str); msg.lang='zh'; speak("chinese");
[02:28:57] <jak2000> ok
[02:29:30] <Uhkis> jak2000: there's absolutely no reason to use pastebin instead of jsfiddle
[02:30:31] <jak2000> hard to build a jsfiddle
[02:30:32] <jak2000> you know
[02:30:41] <jak2000> not detect me the .on event
[02:30:59] <Uhkis> it's just as easy as pastebin
[02:31:29] <jak2000> pastebin in 2 steps you have a entire site...

[05:32:10] <homehg> hello - what is god practice when it comes to form inputs such as date pickers / time pickers for mobile devices. Do you, for example, just use HTML default type="datetime" and accept the mobile devices OS default picker and have a fallback for desktop? Or do you implement your own pickers, probably using something like a jquery plugin?
[05:32:36] <Uhkis> hellyeah: missing quotes
[05:32:54] <hellyeah> damn
[05:33:21] <hellyeah> minssing " ?

[07:22:38] <sinopia> solved
[07:22:51] <sinopia> hellyeah Uhkis: thanks the prop solved it.

[08:00:16] <snfgf> why is the find method undefined?
[08:01:04] <snfgf> $(message_html).filter('li') returns an array of jQuery objects, right? So message in the function is a jQuery object?
[08:01:16] <AdamPDotty> You try to call a function of a function ?
[08:01:41] <snfgf> ?
[08:01:43] <AdamPDotty> message is a callback

[08:13:18] <pavonia> hellyeah: Maybe you should better create DOM elements and set attributes afterwards instead of fiddling with HTML code strings
[08:27:14] <hellyeah> pavonia:  better idea can be using template string
[08:28:36] <pavonia> Or that, yes
[10:55:19] <hellyeah> yo
[11:19:23] <cdal> hey guys
[11:20:06] <cdal> if i have let resumeSection = $('#resume'), can i later combine resumeSection with a string in a jquery path
[11:20:33] <cdal> ie $(resumeSection + ' ul.someclass') ?
[11:20:39] <taplar> no
[11:20:44] <taplar> you'd do a find() off of it
[11:20:57] <taplar> resumeSection.find('ul.someclass')
[11:21:01] <cdal> got it
[11:21:05] <cdal> thankss taplar
[11:33:45] <hellyeah> hey
[11:37:50] <AwkwardCough> yo
[11:38:15] <hellyeah> sup

[17:33:11] <climu> Hi
[17:33:20] <robertmaxrees> hello!
[17:33:37] <climu> I am trying to find the previous element in a document that have a specific class
[17:33:44] <climu> I can't find a way to do that.
[17:35:42] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.  depends on your markup
[17:35:46] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310270/jquery-find-closest-previous-sibling-with-class for some ideas.
[17:37:18] <climu> yea, I saw and tested that.
[17:37:27] <climu> issue is my markup might change.
[17:37:40] <climu> sometimes I need to go to parent sometimes not
[17:37:49] <climu> I will set up a jsbin to explain better I guess
[17:44:11] <climu> jsbin here: https://jsbin.com/tifaxaziya/edit?html,js
[17:44:34] <climu> if someone can help, it's appreciated, I spend already quite some hours and test on that
[17:44:55] <robertmaxrees> show us what you tried.
[17:44:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:45:18] <climu> ok, I put it in comment in the jsbin
[17:45:23] <robertmaxrees> fyi that markup is invalid.
[17:45:29] <climu> is it?
[17:45:38] <robertmaxrees> <span class="find">hover me should select 1</div>
[17:45:46] <climu> yea sorry fixing that
[17:45:53] <robertmaxrees> the bin isn't updating for me.
[17:46:34] <climu> is there something I should do?
[17:46:37] <climu> I updated it
[17:46:49] <climu> I will add the tried in comment in js
[17:46:49] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i never really use jsbin.
[17:47:00] <climu> oh, and thanks robertmaxrees
[17:47:04] <robertmaxrees> try hitting ctrl+s
[17:47:10] <robertmaxrees> and share the new url.
[17:48:08] <climu> ok, then I put the trys before.
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> sooo new url?
[17:48:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:48:33] <robertmaxrees> I'm guessing you're sharing the snapshot and not the latest.
[17:49:23] <robertmaxrees> also: i'm curious what you're actually building that would need this kind of logic.  seems odd do need something like this with such bizarre markup.
[17:49:36] <climu> that I can answer easily
[17:49:59] <climu> https://openstudyroom.org/forum/forum/announcements-26/topic/how-to-display-gobans-in-our-forums-77/
[17:50:27] <climu> I want to integrate a goban plugin called wgo.js into a python forum using the markdown markup
[17:50:51] <robertmaxrees> so you have no control over the markup?
[17:51:01] <climu> https://jsbin.com/tifaxaziya/edit?html,js
[17:51:05] <climu> still same url
[17:51:09] <climu> and not a snapshot
[17:51:26] <robertmaxrees> weird.  i wasn't seeing it update.
[17:51:37] <climu> hum I could write a custom python markdown parser but it sounds even harder to do
[17:51:40] <robertmaxrees> still got some bad markup.
[17:52:05] <climu> really?
[17:52:07] <climu> hum...
[17:52:21] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:52:44] <climu> sure, thanks
[17:53:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, can't technically have divs inside of p tags.
[17:53:26] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[17:53:36] <robertmaxrees> we'll ignore that for now.
[17:53:48] <robertmaxrees> so.  you'll need to do a recursive check.
[17:54:44] <robertmaxrees> .prev() won't work because that only checks the previous sibling.
[17:54:50] <climu> hum, maybe you should know I don't really know js.
[17:54:59] <robertmaxrees> great time to learn a bit then!
[17:55:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:55:05] <climu> indeed :)
[17:55:09] <climu> thanks
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> so .prev() only checks the immediate prior sibling.  the selector is just a filter.
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> $('.find').hover(function(){
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> });
[17:55:37] <robertmaxrees> woops
[17:56:18] <robertmaxrees> prevUntil looks at all previous siblings.  it doesn't traverse beyond that.
[17:56:21] <robertmaxrees> make sense so far?
[17:56:42] <climu> sure
[17:57:04] <climu> but it won't go to parents is it?
[17:57:20] <robertmaxrees> it won't go through children of siblings of the parent.
[17:57:21] <robertmaxrees> so https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310270/jquery-find-closest-previous-sibling-with-class
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> you can combine this with some logic to then check chldren of previous siblings.
[17:58:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd focus on the first case.
[17:58:15] <robertmaxrees> and then we can step through the second one :)
[17:58:43] <climu> I see. I will try that.
[17:59:34] <robertmaxrees> note: prev() on its own is not very helpful here - you'll need some kind of recursive check with that.  also: filter would be helpful here, too.
[18:02:00] <climu> allright, will do some testing, thanks
[21:58:33] <neo_> hi guys ,
[22:43:30] <Verran> howdy
[22:44:04] <Verran> hey what's the right way to check if an element exists using a live query?
[22:44:16] <Verran> not having luck on google
[22:45:31] <Verran> livequery maybe?
[22:53:12] <Verran> nevermind
