[00:00:29] <Cork> lite: depends on how you remove them
[00:00:48] <lite> outer.on("container_close", removeDialog);
[00:02:08] <lite> and removedialog just does a outer.remove()
[00:06:32] <Cork> lite: remove will remove the event listeners on the element yes
[00:06:43] <Cork> or rather it will remove .data for the elements
[00:06:48] <Cork> the browser removes the listeners
[00:06:57] <Cork> unless you keep references to the elements
[00:07:09] <Cork> lite: do you store selectors in variables?
[00:07:13] <Cork> (not function local)
[00:07:50] <lite> lets see
[00:08:14] <lite> Cork: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c04dc0e92cb104f6601c - you - It would appear that I do
[00:08:58] <ravenzz> outer.remove() should be fi ne
[00:09:18] <Cork> lite: is that global?
[00:09:25] <Cork> lite: also those are fine
[00:10:02] <Cork> lite: the reason i asked is that if you do something like this.current = widget.find('.type').eq(index)
[00:10:14] <Cork> it will keep the elements around even if you remove them from the page
[00:10:33] <Cork> cause jquery has a scary selector buffer
[00:11:10] <Cork> this.current.prevObject would be all the .type elements
[00:11:17] <Cork> and the reference will keep those elements alive
[00:11:54] <ravenzz> even if you remove this.current ?
[00:16:23] <lite> Well, all of these functions are stored in a global object called containers.
[00:16:39] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/L4ukj/6/ <--- help..
[00:17:01] <lite> so we have, for instance createDialogContainer() that stores all of the selectors in variables for later use
[00:17:03] <vinex08> 3rd and 4th boxes
[00:17:14] <vinex08> should have smaller height..
[00:19:48] <lite> Cork: var outer = $("<div class='outer_container'></div>"); var container = $("<div class='dialog_container'></div>"); container.appendTo(outer); outer.remove();
[00:19:57] <lite> Would container be removed when outer.remove() is called ?
[00:23:19] <Cork> lite: as long as the container variable isn't kept alive by something
[00:24:28] <lite> Cork: the container variable is declared in the createDialog function which is available through the global object containers = { createDialog: createDialogContainer ...};
[00:24:45] <lite> So I would assume that no - the container variable is not kept alive
[00:25:42] <Cork> lite: if it is defined in a function that runs in function createDialog
[00:25:43] <Cork> it is safe
[00:25:56] <Cork> only if you attach it to something global will it be kept alive
[00:27:11] <lite> ok
[01:19:24] <tomato> hi
[01:19:28] <tomato> i have a job for someone
[01:19:36] <tomato> $10 hr/
[01:19:48] <tomato> who is interested
[01:19:49] <tomato> ?
[01:20:16] <Cork> wrong channel
[01:20:24] <tomato> where i have to post that?
[01:20:28] <Cork> try #freelance
[01:59:06] <antiPoP> Hi, I'm trying to write a plugin from a working jquery code so I can reuse it sin several places
[01:59:08] <antiPoP> http://jsbin.com/lesem/1/
[01:59:33] <antiPoP> however, I don't undertand the "this" variable scope
[02:00:13] <antiPoP> in my code                                     //$("#background_categories > ul").append(
[02:00:32] <antiPoP> works, but I I repalace it with this line not:                                     this.filter("#background_categories > ul").append(
[02:01:40] <Cork> antiPoP: the scope of this is the function call
[02:01:47] <Cork> each function call gets there own this
[02:02:07] <antiPoP> and how can i pass it to the inner function?
[02:02:16] <Cork> if you want to use this cross function calls you need to store it in a different variable
[02:02:19] <Cork> var self = this;
[02:08:37] <RA3OR> i have a $(this).parent().addClass('active'); which works --- how can I .addClass('active') for non-parent? maybe find() ?
[02:09:18] <beachandbytes> what do you mean non-parent?
[02:09:20] <RA3OR> menu link from top click(works) and bottom/footer(doesnt work)
[02:09:37] <beachandbytes> is it a sister element? child etc?
[02:09:46] <RA3OR> its a different ul li
[02:10:13] <beachandbytes> do you have a mockup on jsfiddle or something
[02:10:19] <beachandbytes> tough to tell without seeing the html structure
[02:10:46] <RA3OR> think of two ul lists
[02:11:20] <RA3OR> inside both there are anchors/links, when i click on topmenu link, it finds the parent and adds the class to the clicked anchor
[02:11:24] <antiPoP> cork thanks
[02:11:28] <antiPoP> I did a new version
[02:11:30] <antiPoP> http://jsbin.com/lesem/1/
[02:11:42] <RA3OR> i want to do the same when i click from outside that list
[02:12:10] <antiPoP> but                                     self.filter("#background_categories > ul").append(                      now does not do anything and                       $("#background_categories > ul").append(            works fine
[02:12:11] <antiPoP> why this?
[02:13:01] <Cork> antiPoP: cause your self isn't ul's
[02:13:22] <Cork> so you can't filter self to ul's that have a parent with id id "background_categories"
[02:13:41] <Cork> antiPoP: what you watn to do is .find('> ul')
[02:13:49] <Cork> (you don't want id checks in a plugin)
[02:14:06] <Cork> or possible
[02:14:10] <Cork> children('ul')
[02:17:25] <antiPoP> teh question is that in my code there are two ul
[02:17:32] <antiPoP> so how can I get the outer?
[02:17:41] <Cork> like i said
[02:17:44] <antiPoP> .find('> ul').first()   ?
[02:17:48] <Cork> no
[02:18:01] <Aamir> .closest
[02:18:09] <Cork> both will just get the direct child
[02:18:16] <Cork> so no need to check for first
[02:18:20] <Cork> and closest is the wrong direction
[02:18:32] <Cork> antiPoP: .children('ul') is what you want
[02:18:48] <Aamir> sorry, I just joined so didn't see the question. He said how can i get outer :P
[02:18:49] <Cork> unless you have two outer ul's
[02:19:21] <Cork> Aamir: then don't answer a question you didn't see >_>
[02:19:42] <Aamir> hah true :P
[02:20:49] <antiPoP> tried                                          self.children('ul').append(    and didn't wror
[02:21:10] <antiPoP> *worked
[02:21:18] <antiPoP> Aamir: http://jsbin.com/lesem/1/
[02:21:38] <antiPoP> I can add real data to the jsbin if needed
[02:22:52] <Cork> antiPoP: self.children('ul').append( should work fine
[02:22:53] <RA3OR> beachandbytes: http://jsfiddle.net/Kbfrw/
[02:23:19] <Cork> antiPoP: you can inspect self.children('ul')[0] and see what it matches
[02:23:25] <antiPoP> it doe sn't. Do you want I upload teh json data soewhere so yo can test the bin?
[02:23:36] <Cork> doesn't really help
[02:25:08] <Aamir> oh my, the code is terrible. appends inside .each :(
[02:25:29] <Cork> ah
[02:25:37] <Cork> antiPoP: your original selector is broken
[02:25:42] <Cork> that is why the code doesn't work
[02:26:02] <Cork> antiPoP: also plugins should alway be inside this.each(function() {}) loops
[02:26:03] <antiPoP> well, teh original selector works fine for me
[02:26:24] <Cork> i doubt $('bg') matches anything for you
[02:26:37] <Cork> $('#bg') prob did though
[02:26:52] <antiPoP> mmm
[02:26:59] <Cork> and that is why the code should be in this.each
[02:27:09] <Cork> else you run even when there is no matches
[02:27:28] <Cork> and you can't handle if you give two elements to the plugin
[02:27:30] <RA3OR> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/Kbfrw/ i want to .addClass('active') to the top menu Also when footer menu is clicked
[02:28:29] <RA3OR> something like $('ul#sidenav li a.'+hrefID).find( ":contains("+thisID+")" ).addClass( "active" );
[02:30:34] <antiPoP> I updated teh bin
[02:30:45] <antiPoP> so should I use this.each(data, function(category, items) {    then?
[02:35:16] <antiPoP> Cork: do you mean http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#using-the-each-method ?
[02:36:04] <beachandbytes> RA3OR, use the class of the element to set instead
[02:38:07] <antiPoP> I updated teh bin
[02:38:14] <antiPoP> however it still doe snot work :(
[02:40:02] <RA3OR> beachandbytes: $('ul#sidenav li a.'+thisID).parent().addClass('active'); fixed it
[02:40:12] <RA3OR> but doesnt work on jsfiddle link :)
[02:40:38] <RA3OR> oh, now it works
[02:40:46] <RA3OR> http://jsfiddle.net/Kbfrw/3/
[02:42:01] <beachandbytes> cool
[02:42:34] <beachandbytes> I was going to do it like this http://jsfiddle.net/Kbfrw/2/
[02:42:53] <Tekla> pastebin.com/c3w0c9ZL <-- i'm trying to bind my functions to parts of my html that are always present ... first I tried the "$("body").on("click",".langB",function({" and loaded it with a simple langS() from ready() but then it occurred to me i could put the dynamic part in .ready ... and it works too but i'm getting an error "Uncaught TypeError: Object .langB has no method 'apply'"  help plz :)
[02:45:15] <Cork> antiPoP: yes
[02:45:28] <Cork> antiPoP: did you fix the selector?
[02:46:25] <antiPoP> yes
[02:46:36] <antiPoP> it's on teh latest http://jsbin.com/lesem/1/edit
[02:47:34] <beachandbytes> Tekla, change $(':button',$('#langs')) , to $(':button','#langs')
[02:48:59] <Tekla> thanks, i did ... but i'm still getting the same error :)
[02:49:39] <beachandbytes> did you change it in all the spots
[02:49:41] <beachandbytes> ?
[02:49:59] <Tekla> nope... sec
[02:51:08] <Tekla> beachandbytes: thanks... i'm getting kicked out of the room so i'll have to get back to you :)
[02:51:31] <beachandbytes> okay, well good luck, you shouldn't put a $(), inside another selector
[02:51:42] <beachandbytes> so no nested $(..$())
[02:53:33] <antiPoP_> btw I think that self.children('ul').append( doe snot selet the same than $("#background_categories > ul") actually I need to add items to the inner ul
[02:57:00] <antiPoP> btw I think that self.children('ul').append( doe snot selet the same than $("#background_categories > ul") actually I need to add items to the inner ul
[02:57:32] <antiPoP> cork what about .find("ul ul");
[03:01:59] <antiPoP> I added read json data http://jsbin.com/lesem/1/edit
[03:02:07] <antiPoP> *real
[03:02:30] <antiPoP> if somebody joined recently, i'm tryinbg to conver some working jquery code into a plugin
[03:02:45] <antiPoP> seems teh this.each function is not working. What I'm doing wrong?
[03:06:52] <justHannes> hello People of the jquery … one question, is there any downside to having multiple $(document).ready(); calls in your JS code?
[03:11:16] <rethus> justHannes: ready is only the request if document fully loaded, why should it have a downside?
[03:20:35] <beachandbytes> justHannes, there is not a good reason to have multiple ready calls
[03:20:43] <beachandbytes> at least that I can think of off the top of my head
[03:53:04] <HenryCH> I have the following code to insert a form into a div and then append a close link: $('#box').load('Form.php'); 	$('#box').append('<a id="close">Close</a>');
[03:53:29] <HenryCH> Each one of those lines alone gives the desired result, but if I have both of them, I don't see the close link, somehow it doesnt get appended
[03:54:49] <bigbugjava> I got no answer at #Facebook, so trying here, anyone here knows how I can find my URL TO LIKE for my Facebook app ?
[03:59:33] <abishek> anybody know a good jquery plugin that allows ajax file uploads
[03:59:57] <Guest98776> hey
[04:00:06] <Guest98776> how can i get the func name
[04:00:12] <Guest98776> in a variable function ?
[04:00:13] <Guest98776> ça na pas de sens ça
[04:00:16] <Guest98776> var builtin = { qsh:function(){ console.log(arguments.callee.name); } };
[04:00:21] <Guest98776> this return nothing
[04:00:36] <Guest98776> but it works fine in classical function
[04:00:49] <Guest98776> function qsh(){ };
[04:07:33] <ezekielnoob> hello guys
[04:07:59] <ezekielnoob> http://pastebin.com/0jDBz27j why am i getting an empty of object in line 10? am i missing something?
[04:13:34] <Jattenalle> ezekielnoob, because of scope
[04:14:41] <ezekielnoob> hmmm... ok it's my first time to write an ext. and i'm just following this:http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/ and it seems i did the same thing
[04:15:15] <Jattenalle> yeah but you try to return something
[04:15:21] <Jattenalle> it goes out of scope when you do that
[04:15:55] <ezekielnoob> i see
[04:15:58] <ezekielnoob> let me try to remove that
[04:16:16] <Jattenalle> and the log returning an empty object is also fine
[04:16:30] <Jattenalle> fine -> expected
[04:16:49] <ezekielnoob> ok so what should i do to implement accessible default settings?
[04:17:13] <ezekielnoob> or can you point me out to the right article
[04:17:34] <Jattenalle> you need to set the options to be part of the object
[04:17:38] <Jattenalle> err, does that make sense?
[04:17:53] <Jattenalle> like: this.myoptions = options;
[04:18:05] <ezekielnoob> hmmm ok
[04:18:15] <ezekielnoob> but i wonder why the jquery tutorial showed it this way
[04:18:18] <Jattenalle> also, disclaimer, im far from a pro at jquery or js
[04:18:23] <ezekielnoob> np
[04:18:31] <Jattenalle> the thing you linked doesnt have any return though
[04:18:37] <ezekielnoob> yeah
[04:18:38] <Jattenalle> it expects you to put your own code in
[04:18:48] <Jattenalle> like, on line 5 in http://pastebin.com/0jDBz27j
[04:19:00] <Jattenalle> you'd instead have something like this.myoptions = options;
[04:19:21] <Jattenalle> (mind you, that's a bit of a silly way of doing it, but you get my point.. normally you'd want setters/getters)
[04:19:54] <ezekielnoob> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/ this is the one i'm following
[04:20:37] <antiPoP> I have the following code which just trieds to select an element from a plugin. However, nothintg is selected. What I'm doing wrong? http://jsbin.com/cutab/1/edit
[04:20:54] <Jattenalle> ezekielnoob, hm, yeah i see it
[04:20:57] <antiPoP> I just simplified my previous problem
[04:21:55] <ezekielnoob> so uhm...
[04:22:05] <Jattenalle> ezekielnoob, sorry :( i think this is going outside my comfort zone, i'd just guess at this point
[04:22:11] <ezekielnoob> np
[04:22:14] <ezekielnoob> thanks for the pointers
[04:22:18] <Jattenalle> but it does look like you're doing what the example says though
[04:22:59] <delboy1978uk> i'm using the jquery validator plugin, but i cant seem to get a textarea to validate like normal, is there anything different from textareas?
[04:23:14] <delboy1978uk> textboxes rather
[04:24:06] <antiPoP> any idea?
[04:27:11] <HenryCH> If I do $('#box').append('<a id="close">Close</a>'); some time after the page loads, will my css for #close still be applied or must I apply them with jquery after the append?
[04:28:16] <Cork> HenryCH: if you by mean css from a .css resource; then yes
[04:28:37] <HenryCH> yes it will be applied, right?
[04:28:40] <Jattenalle> yes
[04:28:42] <Cork> ya
[04:28:46] <HenryCH> ok, thks
[04:28:57] <Jattenalle> assuming your css is defined with #close
[04:29:00] <Cork> *by css mean
[04:29:13] <HenryCH> any idea why a .append would not be appending after a .load?
[04:29:36] <HenryCH> if I remove the .load, I see the close link
[04:29:37] <Cork> cause .load is async
[04:29:46] <HenryCH> with the .load it's not even in the dom
[04:29:50] <HenryCH> what do you mean?
[04:30:20] <Cork> $().load(url).append() => $().append() <delay for the response to come back> $().html(response)
[04:30:28] <Jattenalle> are you trying to .append to something that is .load ed?
[04:30:52] <Cork> HenryCH: so the content from the server will replace the close button
[04:30:58] <HenryCH> no I have a div, and I load some html into that div, then I append the <a> to the same div
[04:31:04] <HenryCH> oh I see
[04:31:09] <Jattenalle> you overwrite it with the load :)
[04:31:27] <HenryCH> so I should put the .append in a callback?
[04:31:32] <Cork> ya
[04:31:33] <Jattenalle> add a function to the load's ready callback
[04:31:34] <Jattenalle> ya
[04:35:40] <antiPoP> found teh issue
[04:35:46] <antiPoP> I forgot teh onload metod
[04:35:48] <antiPoP> :--(
[04:36:00] <Jattenalle> antiPoP, :)
[04:36:11] <antiPoP> big fail
[04:39:10] <antiPoP> well, at least now works.. time to lunch...
[04:39:55] <a_fejer> quick question: do I need an anchor for the scrollTop function?
[04:40:52] <Jattenalle> no
[04:41:44] <sfdcNoob__> hi
[04:41:49] <a_fejer> thought so. the frontend dev of my current project seems incapable. thx for the quick response
[04:42:32] <Jattenalle> a_fejer, you can use an anchor, and it can be easier than pixels.. but you dont have to use one
[04:46:36] <a_fejer> one of the frontend devs included a scroll function in the JS and another frontend dev used <a href="#anchor-id" > instead of the function
[04:48:57] <Jattenalle> a_fejer, heh
[04:49:14] <Jattenalle> well anchor is easier to code
[04:49:39] <Jattenalle> bit silly for a "back to top" thing though
[04:49:47] <Jattenalle> since, this.scroll isnt all too hard
[04:50:07] <Cork> well there is a side point of useing href="#"
[04:50:12] <Cork> it's that it works without js
[04:50:17] <Cork> while .scroll doesn't
[04:50:56] <Cork> so building it around that is actually how you should do it :)
[04:51:02] <Jattenalle> <noscript>oh god why would you do this!</noscript>
[04:51:03] <Jattenalle> :P
[04:51:13] <Cork> ?g noscript
[04:51:15] <b-ot> Cork: NoScript - JavaScript/Java/Flash blocker for a safer Firefox ... → http://noscript.net/
[04:51:23] <Cork> ;P
[04:51:46] <Cork> the basic of the page should work without js
[04:51:57] <Cork> and especially if it is easily doable without js
[04:52:00] <Jattenalle> it's also ignored by modern browsers, so you can use it to only show content to browsers with js disabled
[04:52:06] <Jattenalle> works in all major browsers :)
[04:52:30] <a_fejer> well the anchor version would be ok for noscript, but otherwise it's just lazy
[04:52:31] <Cork> no, <noscript> isn't ignored by modern browsers
[04:52:32] <Jattenalle> it really depends on the page and what it's for really
[04:52:49] <Cork> a_fejer: like i said, it is the web way
[04:52:55] <Cork> progressive enhancement
[04:53:01] <Cork> it's how you SHOULD do things
[04:53:04] <Jattenalle> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_noscript.asp
[04:53:22] <Jattenalle> ignored -> i mean the content isnt shown/parsed
[04:53:32] <Jattenalle> unless you have js disabled, of course
[04:53:40] <Cork> Jattenalle: why are you using the biggest lier on the net as proof?
[04:53:47] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[04:53:49] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – A W3Schools Intervention → http://www.w3fools.com/
[04:53:51] <Jattenalle> haha, i wasnt aware i needed proof
[04:54:07] <Cork> i mean the data on that page doens't mean anything
[04:54:14] <Jattenalle> i was poking fun of it, remember?
[04:54:14] <Jattenalle> [13:50:44] <Jattenalle> <noscript>oh god why would you do this!</noscript>
[04:54:17] <Jattenalle> :)
[04:54:35] <Cork> ah, didn't see the comment from that direction
[04:54:43] <Jattenalle> aye, i figured :)
[04:54:49] <Cork> saw it more like "why do you do this" ^^'
[04:55:17] <Jattenalle> though, i will admit, i use it on my game's site.. but that's a deliberate intentional choice that im aware blocks out a lot of potential visitors
[04:55:33] <Jattenalle> blindly using it as a rescue thing or workaround without understanding the implications, is bad :P
[04:55:34] <Cork> <noscript> is fine
[04:55:47] <Jattenalle> heh, i use it to block the entire site. because.
[04:55:50] <Jattenalle> ;)
[04:55:52] <Cork> though i usually do it the other way around
[04:56:05] <Cork> <div id="nojs"> message</div>
[04:56:12] <Cork> $('#nojs').hide()
[04:56:23] <Cork> leave you with more control
[04:56:25] <Jattenalle> heh, yeah that works as well
[04:56:27] <Jattenalle> yup
[04:56:43] <Jattenalle> i do think that if you're making a pure webpage, you should aim to support as much as possible though
[04:57:03] <Jattenalle> nothing quite as annoying as being blocked out because you have JS disabled, only to find the page is using it just to dump ads on you
[04:57:22] <Cork> what i H-A-T-E is when sites do <noscript><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0"></noscript
[04:57:34] <Jattenalle> wtf? why would you even do that?
[04:57:41] <Cork> ya.. thanks i want an infinitely reloading page just cause i have js disabled...
[04:58:11] <Cork> Jattenalle: well they think that if js isn't possible it must be a loading error...
[04:58:15] <Cork> i donno
[04:58:19] <Cork> i see if from time to time
[04:58:23] <Jattenalle> but... js is client side.. i dont, what? :/
[04:58:27] <Cork> quite rare luckely
[04:58:40] <Jattenalle> i've seen a few that reload to a blank page
[04:58:45] <Cork> Jattenalle: ya, but they do thinks with js
[04:58:47] <Jattenalle> i can see the point of that (even if silly)
[04:59:00] <Cork> well, not really
[04:59:21] <Cork> luckely noscript can block running meta and from <noscript>
[04:59:27] <Cork> -and
[05:00:04] <Jattenalle> hm, i might actually remove the noscript block from my site.. i mean without JS half of it will be broken... but meh
[05:00:04] <Cork> but there really is too many sites that forcefully blocks none js rendering
[05:00:09] <Cork> even when there isn't a reason to
[05:00:20] <Jattenalle> pure js sites are just obnoxious honestly...
[05:00:29] <Cork> Jattenalle: well a small hint is good
[05:00:36] <Jattenalle> "Here, check out this cool article I found! www.baseurl.com !"
[05:00:44] <Cork> "This page depends on javascript and some things won't work without it"
[05:00:48] <Jattenalle> at least add an anchor or something!
[05:01:10] <Jattenalle> Cork, yeah that's what i mean, currently i block the site completely, all you see is a "You need JS!" message, cant get to any content
[05:01:12] <Cork> in a banner at the top of the page or similar
[05:01:24] <Jattenalle> i'll change it to still show the message, but also not block the site
[05:01:29] <Jattenalle> it will be a bit broken, and some stuff wont work
[05:01:36] <Jattenalle> but meh, might be a better idea
[05:01:38] * Jattenalle shrugs
[05:01:46] <Cork> what annoys me most is what google map did before
[05:01:52] <Jattenalle> oh?
[05:01:52] <Cork> they redirected to www.google.com
[05:01:59] <Jattenalle> lol
[05:02:08] <Cork> so you had to block reloads to even see the list of js to allow
[05:02:20] <Cork> it was a long list of wack a mole
[05:02:24] <Cork> >_<
[05:02:25] <Jattenalle> oh i hate that
[05:02:34] <Jattenalle> when all you want to do is read a text article
[05:02:36] <Cork> the new solution they have is much better
[05:02:39] <Jattenalle> and there's 50 different domains that want to run js
[05:02:47] <Cork> ya
[05:02:59] <Jattenalle> and it turns out the one you needed to allow was totallyspamads.com/trackercookies/insertbadcode.js
[05:03:07] <Jattenalle> -_-
[05:03:15] <Cork> ya :)
[05:03:49] <Jattenalle> ah yeah wordpress blocks do that all the time
[05:03:52] <Cork> though blocking js isn't enough to block tracking now days
[05:04:01] <Jattenalle> yeah, i dont mind the tracking too much
[05:04:13] <Cork> wordpress uses webbugs now days so wp works without js
[05:04:14] <Jattenalle> it's the silly js that annoys me, especially on sites that are slow-ish already
[05:04:17] <Cork> well i do :)
[05:04:31] <Jattenalle> oh i mean hosted wordpress blogs, not wordpress itself.. sorry for not being clear :)
[05:04:47] <Cork> ya, i mean that too
[05:04:52] <Jattenalle> oh, maybe they updated
[05:04:57] <Jattenalle> honestly havent noticed :P
[05:04:59] <Cork> they load web bugs from a wp.com doman
[05:07:50] <Cork> Jattenalle: http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?v=noscript <--
[05:08:17] <Jattenalle> that's a nice pixel
[05:08:20] <Jattenalle> what am i looking at?
[05:08:45] <Cork> a webbug
[05:09:01] <Jattenalle> oh
[05:09:10] <Cork> wordpress injects it in pages that doesn't use scripts to track them anyway
[05:09:16] <Jattenalle> yeah
[05:09:25] <Jattenalle> google analytics does something simillar
[05:09:33] <Cork> you can do it
[05:09:39] <Cork> but normally it doesn't
[05:09:48] <Cork> you have to explicitly add the img link
[05:09:57] <Jattenalle> not sure if the GA i use does or not, probably not if you have to explicitly tell it
[05:09:57] <Cork> cause analytics is js only by default
[05:10:23] <Jattenalle> i was honestly a bit underwhelmed by what GA provides
[05:10:34] <Jattenalle> sure, it's the stats, but no good way to visualize it
[05:10:41] <Jattenalle> hope you enjoy graphs
[05:11:00] <Cork> well ya the filters you can do is a bit annoying
[05:15:40] <a_fejer> @Cork: I figured out, why the frontend dev uses the anchors. he included the jquery.scrollTo-1.4.3.1.js plugin. still not sure why his not using .animate...
[05:16:07] <Cork> a_fejer: you can do A LOT more things with scrollTo
[05:16:36] <Cork> i use it too if i need to do dynamic page animations
[05:16:51] <a_fejer> is there a big difference between the the plugin and the scrollTo jquery function?
[05:17:10] <Cork> worlds apart
[05:17:17] <a_fejer> I mean the .scroll function
[05:17:42] <Cork> unless they've added a new function i don't know about
[05:18:00] <Cork> cause .scroll is an event listener
[05:18:40] <a_fejer> I'm sure that the scrollTo plugin has more to offer, but at the moment we are just using it for scrolling and navigation (with anchors)
[05:19:06] <Cork> well if you just want to scroll the target to the top of the viewport
[05:19:07] <a_fejer> it supposed to be a parallax scrolling website (with little parallaxing and a lot of scrolling)
[05:19:11] <Cork> then ya it is overkill
[05:19:53] <Cork> but scrollTo can scroll vertical and horizontal at the same time
[05:20:07] <Cork> use offsets so the element is centered instead of at the top (for ex.) and so on
[05:20:39] <Cork> they have a nice demo on the page about the features it has
[05:20:49] <a_fejer> hmm...
[05:21:21] <a_fejer> i'll trust the dev for the moment (I need more frontend/js skillz)
[05:59:31] <sess> when settings bunch of default arguments , what's the defacto way of handling event handler arguments? I.e I want to declare a default function that does nothing
[05:59:48] <sess> do I need to specify myEvent: function(){}?
[06:03:06] <sfdcNoob__> hello
[06:12:51] <Cork> sess: $.noop
[06:13:00] <Cork> ?api jquery.noop
[06:13:00] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.noop(): An empty function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noop/
[06:13:39] <Cork> sess: and that is if you by event mean callbacks not events
[06:13:48] <sess> ah yes
[06:13:49] <sess> thanks
[06:13:58] <Cork> callbacks doesn't have to have a function attached
[06:14:00] <Cork> opps
[06:14:08] <Cork> *events doesn't need to have a function attached
[06:33:30] <dwarder> can i "wait" for async: true ajax requests?
[06:35:49] <sess> when using datatables plugin, is there an equivalent of getData() that fetches currently filtered data? As in what is currenty shown
[06:43:28] <dwarder> are axaj requests with async set to true return promise upon receiveing a content?
[06:43:33] <dwarder> do*
[06:46:50] <delboy1978uk1> arent all ajax calls asynchronous? isnt that the point?
[06:47:33] <dwarder> delboy1978uk1: no
[06:48:12] <sess> sometimes you want to make requests synchronically with javascript
[06:48:51] <sess> dwarder: wouldnt it be easier to just set async: false?
[06:49:10] <sess> or do you want some code running while the request is made, but synchronize it with the request later?
[06:49:48] <dwarder> sess: i have ATM, i don't think my $.when.apply(null, ajax_list).then(function(){      works properly
[06:50:32] <dwarder> sess: i need several ajax requests done either at the same time or one after another
[06:50:53] <sess> i'm not familiar with the promise api of jquery
[06:51:13] <dwarder> sess: and while debugin my code i found out the this $.when doesnt' wait for all ajaxes to finish
[06:54:21] <logikos> this on focus event works as expected when 'edit profile' is clicked and then you click an editable span, but when you tab to another editable span i see the console.log like the on focus event is fireing but it does not select the text http://codepen.io/Logikos/pen/gBCGi
[06:54:35] <logikos> what am i doing wrong?
[06:55:22] <dwarder> logikos: you are not helping me :p
[06:55:28] <dwarder> that is what ;)
[06:55:29] <dwarder> jk
[06:55:42] <logikos> u have not asked a question since i joined
[06:55:49] <dwarder> ohh ok :)
[06:55:57] <logikos> if i know the answer i'll help, but i'm here for help too lol
[06:56:07] <logikos> so... clearly i'm not an expert
[06:57:28] <logikos> anyone have any ideas please?
[06:58:07] <logikos> the strange thing is that a similar test works here: http://jsfiddle.net/logikos/QKUZz/12/
[06:58:26] <logikos> but when i tried in my app it didnt work, so i created a more simplified way to reproduce my issue in codepen
[07:00:36] <delboy1978uk1> using jQuery Validate, how do I validate an array of selects? ie. i have opening_hours['Mon'] thru opening_hours['Sun], all are required
[07:01:37] <DarsVaeda> I have a script error in IE8 in jquery 1.10.2 but I suppose that is something from my code, how can I debug that?
[07:02:09] <delboy1978uk1> delete IE8. Bugs disappear.
[07:02:24] <DarsVaeda> I was looking for serious answers ;)
[07:03:06] <delboy1978uk1> sorry i CANT TAKE ANYTHING ie RELATED SERIOUSLY. ITS PROBABLY NOT A BUG IN YOUR CODE. IN FACT YOU ARE PRObably a better developer than the guys at IE
[07:03:13] <delboy1978uk1> sorry about caps guys
[07:03:35] <delboy1978uk1> put hey pastebin your code
[07:04:10] <DarsVaeda> at least IE thinks it is in line 611 of the complete jquery code which is a function called "globalEval"
[07:04:27] <DarsVaeda> hah maybe I should google that *hits himself*
[07:04:35] <delboy1978uk1> how is it on ff? chrome? safari? opera?
[07:04:46] <DarsVaeda> nothing
[07:04:56] <DarsVaeda> it even works in IE8 just the error pops up
[07:04:57] <logikos> most of the time when i start troubleshooting ie-specific issues while useing jquery the proble is that i left a console.log() somewhere
[07:05:00] <logikos> ie doesnt like those
[07:05:09] <logikos> but u probably would have caught that by now
[07:05:35] <DarsVaeda> logikos I'm looking after that thanks :)
[07:06:06] <DarsVaeda> nope
[07:06:55] <delboy1978uk1> logikos is right. IE cant even do a simple console.log! a bag of shit. a shit sandwich. enjoy your meal.
[07:07:32] <delboy1978uk1> how can i say in the validation plugin, this is required if this isnt checked?
[07:07:50] <delboy1978uk1> ie we need the dropdown value if you havent clicked the box
[07:08:00] <logikos> delboy: although i agree that IE sucks, as developers we have to support browsers out clients customers might use
[07:08:15] <logikos> so like it or not, we still have to deal with it
[07:08:18] <delboy1978uk1> nah i jut tell my customers, change browser or miss out
[07:08:25] <delboy1978uk1> i refuse point blank
[07:08:32] <logikos> i have drawn the line in my company that we no longer support IE 6 and 7 without a HUGE upcharge
[07:08:35] <delboy1978uk1> i crossed that line a long time ago
[07:08:52] <logikos> but the original version of windows7 came with IE8
[07:08:56] <logikos> cant drop support for that yet
[07:09:19] <delboy1978uk1> "It's not often that I use Internet Explorer, but when I do, it's to download another browser"
[07:09:31] <logikos> my IE policy is that i garentee everything to 'function' in IE, i do not garentee the same user experience
[07:09:31] <delboy1978uk1> its a browser download tool
[07:09:43] <logikos> i dont use IE at all
[07:09:45] <logikos> i run linux
[07:09:46] <logikos> :)
[07:09:49] <delboy1978uk1> good man
[07:09:57] <delboy1978uk1> agreed
[07:10:00] <logikos> i have windows in a virtualbox just to test junk in IE
[07:10:03] <logikos> i cant stand it
[07:10:06] <logikos> but if i want to get paid....
[07:10:08] <logikos> lol
[07:10:14] <delboy1978uk1> me neither its fisher price kids crap
[07:10:37] <kev999> hi all - anyone know how to get a collection of option elements from a change event on the bounding select ?
[07:14:04] <kev999> if you console.log $(this[0]) there is an array, but all the other parms are listed by name
[07:14:32] <kev999> I know it'll be something simple - just having a dumb moment
[07:15:03] <shoky> $(this).children()  ?
[07:17:27] <kev999> i'll try
[07:18:17] <Fernandos> Is there a jquery plugin that shows whatever is typed in, in a large font as an overlay ontop of the UI? Like a searchbox overlay
[07:18:46] <DarsVaeda> delboy1978uk1, logikos : IE8 was right
[07:18:48] <DarsVaeda> ^^
[07:19:45] <kev999> shoky - who says there's no such thing as a dumb question! - thanks that's what i wanted
[07:21:22] <kev999> Fernandos - just hook into the dialog UI without the overlay option. Update value on keyup.
[07:21:56] <DarsVaeda> I load a template file with an extension called jTemplates and this template file includes a script part this seems to be not the best thing, although wrapping the script stuff into comments does prevent errors in most browsers (expect IE8) -> http://pastebin.com/VN5kmERQ
[07:22:03] <Fernandos> kev999: dialogUI? do you refer to a plugin, or do you have something else in mind?
[07:22:17] <DarsVaeda> what is the correct way to do this?
[07:22:29] <kev999> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[07:23:36] <Fernandos> kev999: I'm not using jqueryui, it's too large for what I going to do. I probably need 3 jquery plugins in total only for the whole site. "LiveTyping" being one of it
[07:24:26] <Fernandos> AutoSuggest, LiveType and my own jquery plugin
[07:25:25] <kev999> Can't you just use a fixed / absolute positioned div and populate with what you type into a box? - maybe explain why you want to show typed text
[07:26:48] <Fernandos> kev999: As a way to search without a search box.
[07:27:14] <kev999> so where would you type the text ?
[07:27:34] <Fernandos> kev999: anywhere, except when an input box is focused
[07:27:44] <delboy1978uk1> how do you jquery check a checkbox is check?
[07:28:01] <kev999> :checked
[07:28:15] <delboy1978uk1> DarsVaeda IE8 was right about what?
[07:28:34] <DarsVaeda> I made a mistake
[07:28:34] <delboy1978uk1> checked, yes kev999 thats what i meant :-P
[07:28:46] <Fernandos> kev999: you can just start typing and it display what you type in a large enough font as an overlay ontop of all other stuff
[07:29:26] <jphase> DarsVaeda: template tags often mess with stuff like that - you'll need to wrap your scripts in {#literal} <script> //something here </script> {#/literal}
[07:29:27] <kev999> would a fixed div at the bottom of the screen work width 100% and deep enough to allow for large text work? It could then scroll as you type
[07:29:33] <delboy1978uk1> yeah well you will have no end of silly little errors that you cant easily check if you are developing with IE. user another browser and test it in ie afterward if need be. at least you get some decent debug stuff with real browsers
[07:29:44] <DarsVaeda> jphase ahh thanks :)
[07:29:48] <delboy1978uk1> kev999 sounds ok to me
[07:30:36] <delboy1978uk1> <script type="text/javascript"> if you like being more strict
[07:30:37] <Fernandos> kev999: hmm.. I think so, except that it would be better to place it at the top, because it's a pattern that people have been trained to accept. Thanks to the google search box that is a the top.
[07:31:01] <jphase> delboy1978uk1: not needed in html5 ;)
[07:32:11] <kev999> do that then - position:fixed;top:0px    ... and then do $(body).keyup(function() {  .... your update code here ....}
[07:37:29] <kpl> In a form, I have an input with ("#input").keyup(function(e){if(e.keyCode==13){ do_something }}. The form also contains a button (for saving data in the form) which is activated when I press enter, but I only want the enter in the input to activate a function. Howto?
[07:38:00] <HarkonenB> Is there any clean way to stop jQuery forcing animation off for sliders when you change their min/max values?
[07:40:44] <jphase> kpl: well it's sort of dirty to do that, but it sounds like the form itself is using the native functionality (enter submits a form when focused on text input and input or button element is in there) - you can add e.preventDefault() to your text input
[07:42:51] <Fernandos> how do I select body but no focused input?
[07:43:14] <Fernandos> body, :not input:focus ?
[07:43:30] <ravenzz> wat
[07:43:35] <jphase> body:not(:focus)
[07:43:38] <ravenzz> $(document,body)
[07:43:45] <jphase> body:not(input:focus)
[07:43:45] <ravenzz> document.body
[07:44:00] <ravenzz> jphase that doesn't make sense
[07:44:06] <jphase> really no need for body in there though
[07:44:29] <Fernandos> jphase: in my example it makes sense to select body
[07:44:56] <Fernandos> jphase: like this $("body:not(input:focus)") ?
[07:45:19] <jphase> well, :focus are focused elements, :not(:focus) should be the "other" elements that aren't focused
[07:45:19] <ravenzz> Fernandos do you want to select the body elem and those input who aren't focused?
[07:45:23] <Fernandos> wasn't sure how the right selector synthax for 'not' is
[07:45:31] <Fernandos> ravenzz: yes
[07:45:44] <jphase> ravenzz: not really sure what doesn't make sense about that :\
[07:46:02] <ravenzz> jphase body:not(input:focus)
[07:46:19] <jphase> the input didn't make sense no
[07:46:22] <jphase> I switched right after
[07:46:24] <jphase> :x
[07:46:41] <Fernandos> ravenzz: sorry, I wanted to select body but not any input field that is focused.
[07:46:45] <jphase> first one was correct, otherwise it'd be      body input:not(:focus)
[07:46:54] <kpl> jphase: thanks. When you write e.preventDefault(), you mean calling in function(e){}. That does not seem to prevent submit in my form.
[07:48:42] <HarkonenB> Is there any clean way to stop jQuery forcing animation off for sliders when you change their min/max values?
[07:49:10] <ravenzz> var $whatever = $('body, input').not(':focus');
[07:50:16] <ravenzz> Fernandos ^
[07:51:29] <jphase> kpl: http://jsfiddle.net/sPLaR/3/
[07:51:51] <jphase> ravenzz: :not selectors work just fine
[07:52:11] <jphase> (as well)
[07:53:20] <HarkonenB> hmm, looks like i'll just have to use a modified jquery-ui.js
[07:54:42] <Fernandos> ravenzz: ok, it's not receiving the value of keyup http://jsbin.com/lewus/1/edit?css,js,output
[07:55:14] <ravenzz> jphase yep but body is not ant input tag
[07:55:39] <jphase> are there several body elements on the page or something?
[07:56:05] <jphase> I was under the impression we were selecting all non-focused inputs within the body
[07:56:42] <hesco> I have a $('.some_class').change() which calls a function to expose the next piece of my form which I need to have dynamically generated with a database call.  An example of what I'm trying to do is at:  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=6Jks1o1vDP   The backend is working, But I'm new at this jquery stuff and still trying to figure out how to have an ajax call populate an existing div.  Can anyone please point me to an example I can carg
[07:56:44] <hesco> o cult until I better understand the jquery api?  Thanks.
[07:57:02] <ravenzz> Fernandos you have a SyntaxError at line 7
[07:57:31] <xnotte> how can i make #registerform and #loginform, toggle in inverse ? They both start hide, but i want if i click one button, the other shows. http://pastebin.com/m7mCZ7JC
[08:00:01] <Fernandos> ravenzz: k, still no value received http://jsbin.com/lewus/3/edit
[08:01:12] <ravenzz> Fernandos also it is $("#livetype") not $("livetype")
[08:01:33] <ravenzz> I've to go, good luck
[08:03:06] <DevAntoine> hi
[08:03:22] <DevAntoine> is there an easy way to get an element based on another element's classes?
[08:03:38] <sess> that really says nothing
[08:03:47] <DevAntoine> this work when the el has only one class: $('.' + $(el).attr('class'))
[08:04:24] <sess> you want to find all other elements with the same classes as el?
[08:05:44] <sess> as far as I know, query has no built in "get class list", you have to split it yourself
[08:06:17] <sess> then you'd have to store the classes in a set and compare with a set of elements, it might be a bit complex
[08:06:32] <sess> your example above would for example not work if the order of classes is switched
[08:08:29] <jphase> splitting and using .inArray sounds optimal
[08:11:21] <DevAntoine> sess: I don't get why the classes' order is related
[08:11:36] <DevAntoine> jphase: so a one liner ain't possible?
[08:12:17] <jphase> DevAntoine: if the attribute class="some class here" is set, then your selector would be $('.some class here')
[08:12:26] <jphase> so you'd be selecting class some, and elements class and here
[08:12:59] <DevAntoine> jphase: hum yes I know I wasn't talking about that
[08:13:16] <jphase> are you trying to select all the classes from the attribute?
[08:13:17] <DevAntoine> I was responding to this: [17:06] <sess> your example above would for example not work if the order of classes is switched
[08:13:31] <DevAntoine> I want to select all elements having the same classes as a given one
[08:14:07] <jphase> I mean, you could use regex if you REALLY wanted a one-line appraoch
[08:14:31] <DevAntoine> I maybe can turn the string into an array, then join it with a dot
[08:15:03] <jphase> $('.' + $(this).attr('class').replace(/\s+/g, ',.'))
[08:15:41] <delboy1978uk1> is there a bootstrap irc channel? #bootstrap isnt it
[08:15:41] <BillCriswell> ul li ul li ul li ul li ul li a... ='(
[08:15:55] <jedimind> BillCriswell: song of my people
[08:15:59] <jphase> lol
[08:16:26] <DevAntoine> $('.' + $(el).attr('class').split(' ').join('.'))
[08:16:29] <DevAntoine> found it!
[08:16:36] <jphase> hehe, sure that'll work
[08:16:42] <jphase> but...
[08:16:51] <jphase> you'll need comma in there
[08:17:17] <DevAntoine> hu?
[08:17:18] <DevAntoine> no
[08:17:19] <DevAntoine> why?
[08:17:27] <jphase> well, .some.class.foo.bar
[08:17:45] <DevAntoine> yes
[08:17:46] <jphase> they will need all classes, you want to select elements with any of the classes no?
[08:17:46] <DevAntoine> so?
[08:17:51] <DevAntoine> ah no!
[08:17:54] <jphase> oh sorry
[08:17:57] <DevAntoine> I want the element with the same classes
[08:17:58] <jphase> yes you're correct :)
[08:18:33] <BillCriswell> $(el).attr('class').replace(' ', '.')
[08:18:35] <DevAntoine> anyway, thanks for your times guys :)
[08:18:48] <DevAntoine> erf, way better, thanks BillCriswell
[08:18:58] <BillCriswell> No problmeesss
[08:18:58] <jphase> isn't that not recursive BillCriswell?
[08:19:08] <BillCriswell> Ah.
[08:19:22] <BillCriswell> $(el).attr('class').replace(/\s/g, '.')
[08:19:30] <DevAntoine> recursive what?
[08:19:38] <jphase> hehe that's what I was recommending at first
[08:19:48] <jphase> I suppose same speed as split and join - *ponders*
[08:20:06] <sess> DevAntoine: I meant, if you simply compared the class attribute, this could occur: "class1 class2" == "class2 class1", which would resolve to false while you'd probably want it to resolve to true
[08:20:25] <sess> which is why they have to ve split
[08:20:28] <DevAntoine> sess: it's just for a selector
[08:22:10] <BillCriswell> jphase: I have no idea. I have bad luck trying to guess which is quicker usually.
[08:23:42] <BillCriswell> jphase: The split appears quicker.
[08:24:08] <BillCriswell> regex: 0.086ms and split: 0.014ms
[08:24:08] <sess> DevAntoine: fact still stands.
[08:25:25] <sess> or no wait, it doesn't if you require all and transform it into a selector
[08:25:26] <sess> :>
[08:26:45] <BillCriswell> If you do .replace(' ', '.', 'g') it's faster... that doesn't appear standard thogh.
[08:27:54] <BillCriswell> That actually doesn't work it seems.
[08:28:01] <BillCriswell> Ah well.
[08:28:31] <decx> what's the problem here?
[08:29:24] <decx> selecting all elements with the same class names as an element?
[08:29:24] <BillCriswell> Seeing if 'one two three'.replace(/\s/g, '.') was faster than 'one two three'.split(' ').join('.') I assumed the first but I assumed wrong.
[08:30:48] <decx> i would think a regex is always slower than a split regardless of complexity?
[08:31:30] <BillCriswell> decx: It was a really simple one, only reason I thought so in this case.
[08:32:23] <decx> is there a good ux approach to a long horizontal menu ?
[08:32:44] <decx> i'm sick of the 3 lines for mobile
[08:32:47] <decx> ;)
[08:32:57] <jop008> I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/121/ in my fiddle goes fine but in my code at  http://www.happyaway.nl/owner.htm it is wrong
[08:33:10] <jop008> But whay
[08:33:13] <jop008> why
[08:33:20] <jop008> the code is the same
[08:34:16] <delboy1978uk1> whats wrong with it the slider is alternating no problem for me?
[08:34:32] <decx> i get redirected to a login page jop008
[08:34:33] <BillCriswell> I don't see a slider on the second link.
[08:34:54] <jop008> okay do you want a code?
[08:34:59] <Jattenalle> decx, i think the login page is his thing
[08:34:59] <BillCriswell> I should have realized "inloggen" was "login"... Such an American.
[08:35:19] <Jattenalle> the html of it is pretty bad though :/
[08:35:23] <jop008> user john2 and pw john
[08:35:30] <decx> Jattenalle no with javascript disabled you get to the owner.html page
[08:35:49] <Jattenalle> oh, i see
[08:36:00] <Jattenalle> heh, well that's nice i guess
[08:36:17] <Jattenalle> disable js, get to content hidden behind a login
[08:36:21] <Jattenalle> "Security!"
[08:36:23] <BillCriswell> Javascript disable. Ugh.
[08:36:26] <decx> i do all my auth stuff clientside :o
[08:36:27] <decx> ;)
[08:36:28] <BillCriswell> Worst kind of people.
[08:36:34] <delboy1978uk1> waar is de slider?
[08:36:59] <decx> noscript is mandatory for a browser BillCriswell
[08:37:04] <Jattenalle> decx, if(document.secretloginbox.value=='leethax0r95'){body.append('All the god damned HTML!')}
[08:37:11] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha, it's evil!
[08:37:32] <decx> i might spend 5 minutes on every page temporary allowing 50 external hosts but it's worth it
[08:37:44] <Jattenalle> decx, agreed
[08:38:01] <decx> especially since youtube put all the comments on plus.blah api
[08:38:14] <decx> i just keep the blocked and don't have to read youtube comments ;)
[08:38:27] <decx> this*
[08:38:38] <BillCriswell> decx: You have something against racism and homphobia or something?
[08:38:42] <BillCriswell> homophobia*
[08:38:47] <Jattenalle> lol
[08:39:05] <Jattenalle> good wholesome racism and homophobia for the whole family!
[08:39:16] <Jattenalle> "Youtube, because fuk u man ur idiot!"
[08:39:39] <decx> well let's get back to owner.htm
[08:39:45] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:40:31] <decx> jop008 the male/female slider seems to work fine
[08:41:38] <decx> Man (default is man) reminds me of ms swan
[08:41:39] <HenryCH> I have several <a>s on a page, all with the same class '.edit', why is it that when I try to do $('.edit').click( function() {...}); it doesn't work, but $(document).delegate('.edit', 'click', function(e) { ... } ); does work?
[08:41:45] <decx> look like a man !
[08:42:05] <BillCriswell> HenryCH: The .edit links are probably loading dynamically.
[08:42:19] <HenryCH> with the latter, $(this) doesn't seem to point to the <a> that was clicked
[08:42:22] <HenryCH> yes, they are
[08:42:39] <BillCriswell> HenryCH: You have it backwards sorry.
[08:42:45] <BillCriswell> Wait... ok.
[08:42:49] <decx> what version of jquery
[08:43:16] <decx> i always get confused by the inverted syntax of delegate
[08:43:23] <HenryCH> I'm using the latest version
[08:43:25] <BillCriswell> decx: That's what just threw me off.
[08:43:56] <BillCriswell> But if $('.edit').click() isn't working then those links aren't available when the page loads, or you're running it before the document is ready.
[08:43:57] <decx> instead of delegate use $('#myparent').on('event','.mydynamicchild', fn)
[08:44:37] <decx> as #myparent use the container that is present on page load that holds the dynamic elements
[08:44:48] <HenryCH> does that work if the parent is also dynamically created?
[08:44:58] <BillCriswell> No.
[08:45:16] <decx> you need an existing anchor in the document to have .on watch for new stuff
[08:45:27] <decx> $(document) works but is a bit inefficient
[08:45:41] <BillCriswell> Which is why people use $(document) because it's always there.
[08:45:54] <BillCriswell> decx: Indeeeeedi
[08:45:54] <HenryCH> how would I use that?
[08:46:20] <kpl> Is this true? Regarding the selector for .parent(): There will be one parent for each element in the set for which we do parent, and the selector will let us select several, one, or none of those parents.
[08:46:21] <BillCriswell> decx just showed you. $(document).on('click', '.edit', function(){ ... });
[08:46:49] <LastBeerEver> delegation from $(document) may not be a good thing
[08:47:29] <BillCriswell> Yeah, should probably do $('.closestStaticParentElement').on('click', '.dynamicElement', function(){ ... });
[08:47:45] <BillCriswell> kpl: That doesn't sound right.
[08:48:02] <BillCriswell> "will let us select one or no parent" is what I'd imagine.
[08:48:15] <BillCriswell> .parent('.foo') will only select the paren't if it's a .foo
[08:48:22] <HenryCH> ok let me try that BillCriswell
[08:48:41] <decx> fyi you can get .closestStaticParentElement without declaring it again inside the event function if you do function(e) { e.delegateTarget }
[08:48:57] <decx> stumbled over that last week
[08:50:49] <BillCriswell> Haven't really needed that one yet.
[08:51:23] <decx> me neither, so when i did need it last week i was stumped at first, but thankfully the api doc is so good
[08:52:06] <decx> also, it standing right there in the console if you logged e helped ;)
[08:52:09] <HenryCH> doesn't work BillCriswell
[08:52:32] <decx> fiddle us henry
[08:53:42] <HenryCH> Don't think I can fiddle because of the php
[08:54:15] <kpl> BillCriswell: a_set_with_multiple_elements.parent() will give a set with multiple elements. http://jsfiddle.net/89jzr/
[08:54:55] <BillCriswell> HenryCH: http://jsbin.com/xevod/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:54:59] <decx> why wouldnt it kpl?
[08:55:24] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/xevod/2/edit?js,output instead.
[08:55:39] <HenryCH> Oh wait, $('closest static element).on works, I mean the event fires
[08:56:08] <BillCriswell> kpl: Ah.
[08:56:21] <BillCriswell> The order of those will be weird?
[08:56:44] <kpl> decx: Maybe I misunderstood Bill above, but it was a comment to his comment to my question above..
[08:57:23] <BillCriswell> kpl: You understood, I assumed you were working with one element.
[08:57:30] <BillCriswell> I misunderstood.
[08:57:53] <superphly> How do I exclude a line of jquery code from running in ie8? The html tag has "lt-ie9" as a class.
[08:57:55] <BillCriswell> Using .parent() on a collection of elements feels weird to me.
[08:58:35] <ankurk> Hey guys
[08:58:55] <ankurk> How can I refresh dialog on every click and load new stuff?
[08:59:01] <HenryCH> ok cool it's working! thanks guys
[08:59:04] <kpl> BillCriswell: yes, but it is a potential pitfall when doing for a selection on a class
[08:59:29] <HenryCH> killed two birds with one stone
[08:59:34] <ankurk> for example, I have edit & 'add new' buttons and they open the same dialog
[08:59:47] <kpl> BillCriswell: I mean, $(".classname").parent()
[08:59:59] <BillCriswell> superphly: You can do like... if( $('html').is(':not(.ie8)' ){ }
[09:00:09] <BillCriswell> Assuming you have an ie8 class on html.
[09:00:10] <ankurk> so on add new I want all fields cleared but it still has the contents of edit
[09:00:19] <superphly> would: if (!$('html.lt-ie9')) work?
[09:00:36] <BillCriswell> superphly: Would need to look at the length probably.
[09:01:12] <superphly> length of what?
[09:01:16] <BillCriswell> kpl: Yeah. I wouldn't use .parent() like that.
[09:01:16] <decx> i do soemthling like this var oldie = $('html').hasClass('lt-ie7')
[09:01:37] <decx> and then i do if (!oldie) anywhere i need it
[09:01:57] <decx> or similar
[09:02:17] <BillCriswell> superphly: $('html.lt-ie9').length
[09:02:23] <BillCriswell> Would return how many elements are matched.
[09:04:18] <duch_kazatel> good morning #jquery
[09:04:28] <decx> hm is that faster than hasClass BillCriswell?
[09:04:32] <BillCriswell> $('html.lt-ie9') would always be truthy, $('html.lt-ie9').length on the other hand could be truthy or falsy
[09:04:32] <decx> hi duch
[09:04:56] <BillCriswell> decx: I have no idea. I just like that it reads like a sentence lol
[09:05:07] <BillCriswell> if( $('html').is(':not(.ie8)' ){ }
[09:05:21] <decx> to the bat-jsperf !
[09:05:55] <BillCriswell> I'm usually wrong when question has to do with speed.
[09:06:07] <duch_kazatel> looking to see if .is() is faster than checking the length?
[09:06:39] <decx> $('html.lt-ie9').length vs $('html').hasClass(lt-ie9)
[09:06:45] <decx> + ''
[09:06:56] <duch_kazatel> oooh.  my money is on the length check.
[09:07:09] <decx> rien ne vas plus !
[09:07:26] <BillCriswell> I believe the first as well.
[09:08:14] <decx> my favorite error on js perf
[09:08:16] <decx> This slug is already in use. Please choose another one.
[09:08:26] <decx> http://jsperf.com/hasclass-vs-length
[09:08:41] <Happzz>   $('input[name="fields[33]"]').on("change", function() {
[09:08:41] <duch_kazatel> i'll guess that the array length check isn't computing anything - you're just fetching a value.
[09:08:43] <Happzz> what's wrong with that
[09:09:05] <decx> it's not as severe but length is indeed faster
[09:09:07] <decx> good to know
[09:09:15] <duch_kazatel> Especially in opera
[09:10:09] <decx> lol what's going on there?
[09:10:17] <Happzz> ideas?
[09:10:32] <duch_kazatel> Happzz that should work.  have some sample markup to show us?
[09:10:33] <decx> 2377ops vs 250k
[09:11:20] <Happzz> duch_kazatel far too complicated to put on jsfiddle
[09:11:28] <Happzz> duch_kazatel it's ajax loaded content though.
[09:11:35] <duch_kazatel> Happzz there we go.
[09:11:39] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[09:11:48] <duch_kazatel> Happzz you can only bind to content that exists at the time of binding.
[09:11:49] <Happzz> well, .on() is supposed to bind to it, doesnt it?
[09:11:53] <LastBeerEver> why would you care for speed? it should be a problem when it gets one, and then you make some tests
[09:12:02] <Happzz> duch_kazatel what do you suggest?
[09:12:15] <BillCriswell> Happzz: Event delegation.
[09:12:35] <duch_kazatel> Happzz .on() can only bind to something that exists.  instead use the delegated syntax $("parentThatExists").on("change", 'input[name="fields[33]"]', function() {
[09:12:52] <Happzz> uhm. i'll try.
[09:12:56] <duch_kazatel> where parentThatExists is an element that's in the dom at pageload.
[09:13:15] <duch_kazatel> it ca be document, the body, a parent container, etc.
[09:13:29] <decx> that has to be the most asked question, the documentation should reflect that
[09:13:44] <BillCriswell> decx: Easily.
[09:14:12] <duch_kazatel> the documentation explains it, but poorly imo.
[09:14:25] <Happzz> duch_kazatel great. thanks.
[09:14:37] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:14:50] <Happzz> does it matter what parent i bind it to, performance-wise?
[09:15:05] <decx> the closest one that exists on page load is best
[09:15:11] <duch_kazatel> yup
[09:15:18] <Happzz> okay.
[09:15:22] <BillCriswell> Happzz: That's something you shouldn't have to worry about till it becomes an issue though.
[09:15:30] <Happzz> awesome.
[09:15:37] <duch_kazatel> that way you're not evaluating every, say, click even in the document unnecessarily.
[09:15:44] <duch_kazatel> also makes things a little easier to read later on.
[09:20:29] <duch_kazatel> also: this thing is neat https://github.com/jimhigson/oboe.js/blob/master/dist/oboe-browser.js
[09:20:45] <duch_kazatel> in-browse JS "chunking"
[09:20:48] <duch_kazatel> *browser
[09:20:57] <duch_kazatel> act on JSON before it's done downloading.
[09:21:19] <decx> so can i do pagination from a master json file with that?
[09:21:43] <duch_kazatel> it's more meant to act on things as they're being downloaded.
[09:21:55] <duch_kazatel> so you can start, say, rendering search results, before you have the whole file downloaded.
[09:21:56] <decx> yeah that's a pretty extreme example
[09:22:01] <decx> but it's an example ^^
[09:22:20] <duch_kazatel> it's one way to use it.
[09:22:58] <decx> does it involve a new header format that tells me how long it's going to be?
[09:23:03] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:23:07] <decx> like metainformation in mp4
[09:23:12] <duch_kazatel> http://oboejs.com/api
[09:24:05] <decx> ill put it on watch, you never know what you need when ;)
[09:24:11] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[09:24:24] <duch_kazatel> i could deffo use this for our search pages.
[09:26:52] <Sendoushi> devil's saying: wouldn't it be better for jquery if we just included what we need like Mout?
[09:27:21] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi you mean, like, only include the modules/methods you need?
[09:27:27] <Sendoushi> exactly duch_kazatel
[09:27:35] <duch_kazatel> you can do that.
[09:27:48] <Sendoushi> just by including the file i need?
[09:27:53] <ankurk> can I overwrite the default close button of jquery dialog?
[09:28:03] <decx> 30kb gzipped, already in hundreds of millions of caches if you use google cdn
[09:28:33] <Sendoushi> ankurk: it's javascript you can overwrite everything :p
[09:28:56] <decx> there's an option for that in the dialog api
[09:29:20] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: how would you use that modular approach in a require project for example?
[09:33:03] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi you mean require.js?
[09:33:03] <duch_kazatel> http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[09:33:24] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: but that way you're not just using what you need
[09:33:25] <duch_kazatel> also: jquery fully supports AMD.
[09:34:05] <Sendoushi> i mean... i just want to select an element and add a class to it for example. not really the best example but for the sake of the argument
[09:35:06] <duch_kazatel> so you want to only include the things that are required to make that work?
[09:35:35] <fabioportieri> 30k is not so much that would require a modular approach like in jquery-ui
[09:36:09] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: exactly
[09:36:13] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery#how-to-build-your-own-jquery
[09:36:19] <Tomashe> hey guys , there is a way to change the jquery mobile pages transitions globaly?
[09:36:38] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: yes that is an approach but... i kind of can't go there in my example
[09:36:39] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi these are the modules: https://github.com/jquery/jquery#modules
[09:36:54] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi hrm?
[09:36:57] <Sendoushi> but it's interesting!
[09:37:11] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi I'm sure you could build out your own solution, too.
[09:37:18] <Sendoushi> the thing i was asking was more like "oh... now i need this function right on this view"
[09:37:30] <Sendoushi> i'm not saying this is bad... just informing myself :D
[09:37:50] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi ah, then yeah that's likely something you'll need to hand roll.
[09:38:07] <Sendoushi> yeah... ok then :)
[09:38:11] <Sendoushi> no need for that
[09:38:36] <Sendoushi> i'm here searching for projects to contribute to with javascript in mind ehehe
[09:39:25] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[09:40:59] <greengriminal> Is there a way to return multiple attributes for an element: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8920596
[09:41:25] <greengriminal> L3 & 4 will return the individual value of the attribute.
[09:41:53] <greengriminal> So my question is why does Line 1 not return both values
[09:42:14] <Velveeta> greengriminal: you can use the native js getAttributes function to get a map of all of them
[09:42:35] <Velveeta> but there isn't a way to get back multiple from just calling the attr function with some different params or anything
[09:42:50] <duch_kazatel> greengriminaln that first line is using this syntax: https://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2
[09:43:23] <greengriminal> right i see
[09:43:32] <greengriminal> and thanks @Velveeta
[09:43:37] <Velveeta> no problem
[09:46:55] <BillCriswell> It's weird that .css can grab multiple styles but .attr can't?
[09:48:00] <BillCriswell> .attr can't grab multiple attributes*
[09:48:57] <duch_kazatel> at least for setting multiple attributes that'd be cool.
[09:49:10] <decx> you can set
[09:49:30] <decx> attr({ attr: 'stuf, attr2: 'stuffit'}
[09:49:34] <decx> afaik
[09:49:48] <BillCriswell> $('div').css( ['color', 'background-color'] ) is cool but $('div').attr( ['class', 'id'] ) is a no go for whatever reason.
[09:50:08] <Velveeta> i wasn't aware the css function could do that
[09:50:30] <duch_kazatel> wait it takes an array?
[09:50:34] <duch_kazatel> i though it took an object.
[09:50:48] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/jixi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:51:07] <Velveeta> yeah i'm looking at the API docs right now, an array is a valid way of request multiple getters
[09:51:17] <Velveeta> hooray for new knowledge
[09:51:21] <duch_kazatel> well shit.  that's neat.
[09:51:35] <fabioportieri> i prefer object literal syntax :>
[09:51:52] <BillCriswell> I don't think you can get them that way though?
[09:51:55] <Velveeta> the object literal syntax is for a multi-setter though isn't it?
[09:52:15] <fabioportieri> oh, indeed i only used for getter
[09:52:33] <fabioportieri> no wait
[09:52:47] <fabioportieri> for setters too, what am i saying
[09:53:16] <fabioportieri> only for setters i mean
[09:53:21] <fabioportieri> sorry i'm really tired :\
[09:53:25] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:53:29] <fabioportieri> eheh
[10:11:25] <Whiskey> $("body").css({"max-width": window.screen.availWidth - 100 + "px"}) <-- something wrong in that one?
[10:13:28] <Whiskey> naa its set but it still be bigger then that enoying :D
[10:25:11] <StevanKarleusa> all serbs and all who support serb people in these harsh times, PM me right now!
[10:26:34] <amaroks> Hello, How can I convert some binary values into three byte checksum?
[10:26:53] <decx> Whiskey screen.availWidth refers to the whole screen and not just the viewport of the browser
[10:27:08] <StevanKarleusa> all serbs and all who support serb people in these harsh times, PM me right now!
[10:27:40] <duch_kazatel> StevanKarleusa you're spamming
[10:38:40] <LindsayMac> I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around select2 's taggable feature http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#tags
[10:39:07] <LindsayMac> their example code is a little too lean for me to figure out hwat is going on that is different from the other code.
[10:40:08] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac it's pretty easy - pass .select2() and object with a property called "tags" whose value is an array of values
[10:40:15] <LindsayMac> I can see that they have a new attribute called tags: [] which seems to hold the array to be searched versus what si used prviously
[10:40:54] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i have this right now https://gist.github.com/anonymous/16665fd1ed69f8e6332b
[10:41:10] <LindsayMac> (i am working in someone else's code so I am feeling out how he did things)
[10:41:13] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[10:41:27] <LindsayMac> and currently has it works, it's doing everything select2 should be doing minus tagging feature
[10:42:01] <LindsayMac> am I right in assuming that it is getting the selectable values from a ul?
[10:42:01] <duch_kazatel> ah, that's why you're confused.
[10:42:05] <LindsayMac> that is where I am confused
[10:42:10] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yea. I know it is.. ha
[10:43:04] <LindsayMac> basically i was asked to convert this to work via the tagging model but I am having a hard time just because i'm a smidge lost as to what the initial developer did.
[10:43:07] <duch_kazatel> ivaynberg.github.io/select2/#drag_drop
[10:43:15] <LindsayMac> Plus the fact that i've not iuse select2
[10:43:19] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[10:43:34] <LindsayMac> AH THANKS!
[10:44:02] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  just one quick question.. Looking at the example I gave.. how in the world is it getting my list of info?
[10:44:06] <LindsayMac> is it from the ul stuff?
[10:44:51] <duch_kazatel> no clue.  something tells me it's doing that first bit somehwere else.
[10:45:13] <duch_kazatel> that code is organized a little differently than what I would have done.
[10:45:35] <decx> is there any benefit to prefix a varialbe with $ or is that just to keep jquery reliant vars separate from pure js?
[10:45:36] <LindsayMac> well yea its doing ajax : {} to GET the data from the server but I can't figure out once the data is in ajax format how select2. knows where to find it
[10:45:56] <LindsayMac> I would have assumd that the bit I pasted to you would require some type of selector to say  "get the info here.."
[10:46:26] <duch_kazatel> without reading the docs, I'm guessing that codeinits the select2 plugin on $element, then finds a ul and then applies a method called sortable (from jqueryUI iirc)
[10:46:37] <duch_kazatel> the UL probably doesn't contain the data.
[10:47:09] <duch_kazatel> and decx I do it because it tells me which vars are jquery objects and which aren't.
[10:47:39] <decx> ok that's what i thought
[10:47:57] <duch_kazatel> because you can do things like var aThing = $('.someClass')[0];
[10:48:13] <duch_kazatel> easy to remember that aThing isn't actually a jquery object in that case.
[10:48:17] <decx> right
[10:56:35] <BillCriswell> This code is a jerk.
[10:59:13] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ah ok i am starting to see it now.. This code is using ajax to get the list of "tags" so I need to work out how to make the ajax list "taggable" so I can write back into that array and then save to the DB.. I can save to the DB no problem from an array but I am SOO not the best with javascript.. lol
[11:00:27] <LindsayMac> So i think their normal "tagging" approach isn't going to be the right direction
[11:02:51] <duch_kazatel> yes it will - you'll init with that array.
[11:04:31] <LindsayMac> hmm.
[11:05:00] <LindsayMac> its strange. I"m seeing so many different scenarios where some people use tags: true, and others use tags: [data...]
[11:05:12] <LindsayMac> in the docs it doesn't show a 'true' arg as something that's an option
[11:05:36] <LindsayMac> but i'm going to plug away. Somtimes I just have to type out my thoughts into a room to get my brain moving. Input from the room is ALWAYS helpful too
[11:06:08] <duch_kazatel> code it out.  that's alwyas the best option.
[11:07:13] <BillCriswell> Just remember. The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plane.
[11:07:31] <LindsayMac> Gah ok sweet.. i got the tagging to work.. now I need to just get it to write back into the DB as such and save as a value in the fielf
[11:07:33] <LindsayMac> field
[11:07:35] <LindsayMac> yippee
[11:32:55] <Vaughn> hey all, quick question for somebody with jQueryUI knowledge, i'm trying to overwrite a function "_moveToTop", but can't figure out the proper object path to get to it to do so
[11:39:28] <pom_life> Velveeta: You awake? :D
[11:42:54] <Velveeta> yassir
[11:44:04] <Velveeta> vaughn: don't try to reference it from its object prototype path, override it with the factory like this: $.widget('ui.dialog', $.ui.dialog, { _moveToTop: function () { ... }});
[11:44:27] <Vaughn> ah, okay, thanks, makes sense
[11:44:51] <Velveeta> plus, if you ever have need of calling back to the original function for whatever reason, from within your overridden function, you can just call: this._super();
[11:45:30] <Velveeta> pom_life: yeah i'm awake, at the office, still trying to get my new laptop setup all wrapped up
[11:45:36] <Velveeta> gotta get my VM's in order
[11:52:36] <pom_life> Velveeta: I may have a few questions regarding how we got the table last night to correspond to the dom table.
[11:52:41] <pom_life> Velveeta: Give me a few moments
[11:53:46] <Velveeta> sure
[11:56:48] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Do you use any particular "swipe" event setup?
[11:57:18] <Velveeta> not currently, i've used hammerjs in the past for touch event support, but not for swipes specifically
[11:58:15] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Shit is annoying.
[11:58:38] <Velveeta> yeah, i'm not a fan of having to deal with mobile interfaces, fortunately i have somebody on my team that's gung ho about that
[11:58:52] <Velveeta> so i'm gonna offload most of that onto him, while maintaining ownership of the final code ;)
[12:00:50] <BillCriswell> I normally enjoy it. Just not in the mood to have 4 devices out figure out each of their issues.
[12:04:31] <BillCriswell> Having out all these devices just feels really... stupid.
[12:06:26] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i typically use emulators for the device-level testing, so i'm not sure what it's like juggling actual devices, though it sounds like a pain in the ass :D
[12:07:48] <BillCriswell> I understand why it's good to have the device in your hand and get a feel for a touch screen, but having a bunch out relatively the same size is a bummer.
[12:13:12] <pom_life> Velveeta: Here I have a very barebones example. What is the most intuitive, simply way to connect $FoobarTable and FoobarTable, so that manipulating FoobarTable also manipulates $FoobarTable? I realize we went over this last night, but after you took off I tried to rewrite it and found that I lacked a solid understanding. --->http://jsfiddle.net/po
[12:13:12] <pom_life> mlife/DrA8B/1/
[12:34:55] <BillCriswell> Hammer just saved my ass.
[12:35:25] <Velveeta> billcriswell: woo hoo! pom_life: looking now
[12:35:56] <pom_life> Velveeta: Making a sandwich, back in 5 minutes. Thanks for looking it over, my condolences for the repetition
[12:36:56] <BillCriswell> It would only be fair to make Velveeta a sandwich as well.
[12:39:11] <Velveeta> i just finished lunch, no sammiches for me :)
[12:39:35] <pom_life> I'll honor velveeta by adding velveeta to my sandwich.
[12:39:52] <BillCriswell> Turning down a sandwich... I'm not sure that's the real Velveeta.
[12:49:35] <Sendoushi> hey guys. interested to know how the jquery walks the dom and what really is the $('body') (as an example) object. do you know where i can find this in the src?
[12:51:19] <jedimind> Sendoushi: jquery uses a selector engine called sizzle
[12:51:28] <jedimind> which leverages mostly css to find these objects
[12:52:31] <Sendoushi> hmmm
[12:52:41] <Sendoushi> thanks i'll research
[12:53:34] <Sendoushi> interesting... seems like something i would like to use :P
[12:53:40] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i wouldn't turn it down normally, but i'm trying to drop some of this programmer weight! :D
[12:54:04] <duch_kazatel> sizzle does some smart parsing for you to make some selectors a little faster.
[12:54:13] <Velveeta> sendoushi: jquery makes dom traversal a snap, literally as easy as targeting elements in css due to the selector engine
[12:54:36] <Sendoushi> i know that Velveeta but i was trying to go a little more barebones
[12:54:40] <duch_kazatel> though you can use querySelectorAll() for much of the same effect these days.
[12:54:45] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Standing desk challenge? I'll do it if you do it.
[12:54:45] <Sendoushi> and check the insides. really understand
[12:54:49] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document.querySelectorAll
[12:55:20] <Sendoushi> oh... that querySelectorAll... hmm
[12:55:33] <Sendoushi> though how will you get the parent for example?
[12:55:33] <duch_kazatel> what are youy trying to do?
[12:55:42] <Sendoushi> just inform myself duch_kazatel
[12:55:48] <pom_life> Velveeta: Did you look over the example fiddle?
[12:56:07] <duch_kazatel> querySelectorAll just takes CSS sytax.
[12:56:10] <sacho> Sendoushi, node.parentNode
[12:56:15] <Velveeta> sendoushi: in the latest jquery release, they went to an amd style of module inclusion, so you can load as much or as little of it as you want
[12:56:26] <duch_kazatel> didn't I say that earlier, Sendoushi?
[12:56:30] <duch_kazatel> the AMD thing?
[12:56:32] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: that is also one of the things i'm researching
[12:56:35] <Velveeta> if you want to load just the constructor function, and minify/gzip it, you're probably talking a handful of kilobytes
[12:56:36] <Sendoushi> yes you did duch_kazatel
[12:56:45] <duch_kazatel> oh aren't you the one who wanted to only load it when you're going to use it?
[12:56:52] <Sendoushi> yep i am :)
[12:56:58] <duch_kazatel> like with .addClass() - only load that code when you're actually going to use it on-page.
[12:57:00] <Sendoushi> i'm just wondering how stuff is made
[12:57:04] <duch_kazatel> instead of precompiling ahead of ti,e.
[12:57:27] <duch_kazatel> well, not necessarily compiling, but you know what I mean.
[12:58:26] <Velveeta> pom_life got pulled into a meeting and then had to take a phone call to give a buddy a reference for a job
[12:58:34] <Velveeta> about to get back on your example, but i did look at it
[12:58:42] <Sendoushi> yes i want that duch_kazatel but i'm also wondering on how stuff are made
[12:58:42] <pom_life> Velveeta: Not a problem!
[12:58:48] <Velveeta> you need to alter your data array to be an array of objects vs just ints
[12:59:26] <Velveeta> sendoushi: one thing you can use as a shortcut to learning the guts of the library is a couple of videos paul irish put together about things learned from reading the jquery src
[12:59:40] <Velveeta> it's a little outdated at this point, but it'll give you a good idea into the inner workings of it in general
[13:00:07] <Velveeta> here's part 1 of that: http://www.paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
[13:00:08] <Sendoushi> hm that seems interesting
[13:00:14] <Velveeta> and part 2: http://www.paulirish.com/2011/11-more-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/
[13:00:19] <Sendoushi> i'll check it thanks
[13:00:26] <Velveeta> should be easy to digest before you actually go trawling through the code
[13:00:44] <Sendoushi> i want to start to contribute to the open source world :)
[13:00:55] <Velveeta> but i myself have read through the jquery src on multiple occasions, and it definitely helps to physically go through that process after a certain amount of time just being a consumer of it
[13:01:20] <Sendoushi> there are some stuff that i dont care in jquery but others...
[13:01:48] <duch_kazatel> it also helps to know javascript really well.
[13:01:48] <Sendoushi> i guess that contributing to jquery will be a hard thing for me but...
[13:02:04] <Sendoushi> you can only know javascript really well if you keep on working and working :)
[13:02:26] <duch_kazatel> yup.  same with jquery.  or anything else, for that matter.
[13:02:38] <Sendoushi> yep
[13:02:45] <duch_kazatel> hell, contributing to the docs can be a big help, too.
[13:02:58] <duch_kazatel> clarifying language, providing new examples, ect.
[13:03:00] <duch_kazatel> *etc.
[13:03:17] <Sendoushi> i understand that but... i would like to contribute more hands on
[13:03:33] <decx> idle in #jquery and help people, that's contributing as well
[13:03:33] <Sendoushi> so i can evolve also
[13:03:49] <duch_kazatel> that is hands on, and it helps get you acquainted with how the library is supposed to work.
[13:04:03] <duch_kazatel> if you want to be a core contributor, that's great.  but there's plenty of stuff top do.
[13:04:07] <duch_kazatel> s/top/to
[13:04:08] <BillCriswell> and how people suppose the library is going to work.
[13:04:43] <duch_kazatel> ooh, I like it BillCriswell
[13:05:32] <Max-P> Hey there, does anyone know if it's possible to prevent the context menu (tap on hold) on Android *without* preventing scrollable divs from scrolling?
[13:05:50] <Max-P> tap and hold*
[13:06:19] <kev999> hi all - just a quick question (easy 4 you guys) - how do I check if a vlue exists in a slect dropdown (is there an easy way without .each)?
[13:06:37] <duch_kazatel> Max-P http://stackoverflow.com/a/20692150/923919
[13:06:38] <duch_kazatel> that help?
[13:07:09] <duch_kazatel> kev999 you'll have to do some kind of manual parsing of the dropdown, but it through .each() or a for loop or something else.
[13:07:19] <Velveeta> kev999: you could use a selector like $('#yourSelectDropdown').find('option[value="someValue"]').length
[13:07:39] <duch_kazatel> that's a good one, too.
[13:07:53] <kev999> yeah - I'll try that thanks
[13:08:35] <Velveeta> sendoushi: i wanted to be a core contributor myself, after the last conference i attended... figured i'd start out by just sitting in here and offering assistance to the masses
[13:08:46] <Velveeta> i haven't made it past this stage yet ;)
[13:08:56] <sacho> the unwashed masses need lots of washing
[13:08:59] <Sendoushi> :)
[13:09:03] <Max-P> duch_lunch, just tried it, doesn't seem to work (popup still appears) :/
[13:09:15] <duch_lunch> Max-P you might not be able to fully prevent it.
[13:09:15] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: i also lurk around
[13:09:16] <krambiorix> hi, when i do   var jrdata = {};  var blokid="4"; jrdata[blokid] = {.......};  and send jrdata with ajax, i see in PHP that my array jrdata starts with 0 and not with 4
[13:09:32] <duch_lunch> either way, I'll be back.  time for food.
[13:09:48] <Max-P> I'm going to try the solution right under (using a "shield" element covering the image)
[13:10:08] <Velveeta> krambiorix: that's not an array, it's an object, it should be received as an associative array in php, with a key named "4" i would think
[13:10:30] <Velveeta> if you're trying to pass a literal array ([] vs {}) with just index 4, you can't.. javascript doesn't allow you to skip array indexes
[13:11:22] <TheEternalAbyss> so I'm wondering about the way .find and .each works... I have this $(#foo").find("option").each(function(){$("option").remove(); }    it seems to be removing all the <option> tags, not the ones just inside <div id="#foo"></div>. DO I need to be specific on my .each() as well?
[13:11:55] <decx> you're removing all options in your function
[13:11:59] <decx> it's quite literal
[13:12:03] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss: inside of your .each() function, you're referencing $("option") which says to grab all options in the page
[13:12:08] <decx> do $(this).remove() instead
[13:12:13] <TheEternalAbyss> ah
[13:12:14] <Velveeta> you should use $(this) instead, which will reference just the current option in that loop
[13:12:22] <Velveeta> yeah, what decx said faster than me
[13:12:22] <kev999> Max-P - not sure what yout trying to achieve, but can you style the popup off-page - not familiar with android - just a thought
[13:12:31] <Sendoushi> shouldn't jquery check or have an option to say which browser is being used? why? because there are things that use complex code to do something that the browser already does
[13:12:36] <sacho> or simply $('#foo').find('option').remove()
[13:12:38] <TheEternalAbyss> $(this), gotcha. I figured I wasn't telling it what to remove properly
[13:12:45] <TheEternalAbyss> thank you guys
[13:12:50] <Velveeta> kev999: i think he's talking about the native popup that appears when you hold in one spot for a few seconds, to all for selecting text and copy/pasting it
[13:12:52] <decx> right, no need for each in this case
[13:12:59] <sacho> or simply $('#foo').remove('option')
[13:13:04] <Max-P> duch_lunch, Amazing, the other solution worked, thank's for pointing the right SO post at least :)
[13:13:14] <sacho> okay, no, the last one was wishful thinking
[13:13:14] <krambiorix> Velveeta, what can i do then ?
[13:13:17] <TheEternalAbyss> sacho: hmm that could work too
[13:13:23] <Velveeta> sendoushi: jquery deprecated browser-checking a couple versions back, you should be doing feature detection now
[13:13:25] <sacho> stupid filter vs find
[13:13:54] <decx> filter vs find is this channels pet peeve
[13:14:11] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[13:14:17] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: i know that. i'm talking about core usage of stuff that isn't needed anymore and so ... takes ou performance
[13:14:28] <Velveeta> krambiorix: if you're declaring it as an object, you shouldn't be having this problem.. your snippet of code that you pasted used an object, i was asking if you put an object by mistake and you're actually using an array
[13:14:41] <Sendoushi> even animate could use css transition capabilities
[13:14:45] <Velveeta> sendoushi: like what? example?
[13:14:50] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[13:15:06] <Sendoushi> am i making sense?
[13:15:07] <Max-P> kev999, I'm doing drag and drop using touchstart, but I need tap-and-hold behavior (because the list containing my draggable elments needs to scroll). If I preventDefault(), it also blocks the scrolling. And since I do tap-and-hold, the delay is long enough for Android to trigger the context menu for the image (Open in new tab, save, copy link and stuff). I figured it out, I just putted a div in front of it so the image can't be
[13:15:08] <Max-P> selected.
[13:15:31] <sacho> I don't think animate's interface maps directly onto css transitions
[13:15:34] <Velveeta> so in order for jquery to use something like css transitions for its animations, it would have to either bloat itself with tests for those features itself, or include something like modernizr to do those tests, and still bloat itself
[13:15:38] <Sendoushi> sacho: it doesn't
[13:15:42] <sacho> if it does, it sounds like it could be your entry into being a core developer :p
[13:15:56] <sacho> well, there's your problem :)
[13:16:01] <Velveeta> plus, not all browsers will support css transitions, and those that do don't support the number of properties that jquery can animate on, with css transitions
[13:16:03] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: true but sometimes you already use modernizr... soooo....
[13:16:05] <krambiorix> Velveeta, but it's an object
[13:16:10] <Sendoushi> or maybe you already made a detection
[13:16:26] <Velveeta> yes, sometimes *you* (and i) already use modernizr, but jquery doesn't want to couple itself to an external library that may be in use
[13:16:43] <Velveeta> jquery is written with the assumption that it's the only one in the game
[13:16:44] <Sendoushi> just saying as an example because it would help on performance on apps that use a lot of js
[13:16:53] <sacho> krambiorix, how are you decoding the data in php
[13:16:56] <Sendoushi> yep exactly what i'm talking about :P
[13:17:12] <Velveeta> well they leave those kinds of performance considerations up to the developer to decide how to implement
[13:17:18] <kev999> glad you got there Max-P
[13:17:19] <Sendoushi> shouldn't it check? or at least have a way to pass options
[13:17:28] <Velveeta> if you want to use css transitions, you're not forced to use jquery's animate function, you can do it in a handful of css lines
[13:17:36] <Sendoushi> anyway this was just an example (css transitions)
[13:17:54] <sacho> krambiorix, http://codepad.viper-7.com/K093ir
[13:18:02] <Velveeta> if it checked, and used css transitions where they were available, and had a fallback to js animations where they weren't, it would be writing and maintaining 2 separate implementations and making itself even larger
[13:18:03] <Sendoushi> i thought of it because in the app that i work in, we basically use addClass and removeClass
[13:18:20] <sacho> you're either not serializing an object to json or you're not deserializing it properly on php's side
[13:18:26] <Sendoushi> well... you have some sense there
[13:18:28] <decx> on this topic, is it good practise to do a browser check and then serve the right prefix when doing .css()
[13:18:48] <decx> like .css('transition',function()...)
[13:18:56] <Sendoushi> decx from my experience... it's best for you to add and remove classes
[13:18:58] <sacho> using browser prefixes isn't good practice at all :)
[13:19:04] <Velveeta> decx: i would say no, because there's also no guarantee that aside from the vendor prefix, the parameters are the same
[13:19:11] <Sendoushi> this way you just make visual stuff on the css
[13:19:20] <Sendoushi> where javascript just takes care of the middleware
[13:19:23] <Velveeta> like you couldn't serve up an ms-filter gradient with the same parameters as a -webkit-gradient
[13:19:24] <decx> yeah it's just a bitch with all the -webkit prefixes that are becoming standard
[13:19:55] <decx> -webkit everywhere, i just want to use 'transition' and not repeat myself 5 times ;)
[13:20:06] <Velveeta> and yeah, i agree about just using css classnames and having javascript just toggle those classnames
[13:20:12] <Sendoushi> decx: why don't you use the add class and remove class approach?
[13:20:14] <Velveeta> as opposed to writing a bunch of stylistic logic into your js
[13:20:23] <decx> Sendoushi i do that when it's applicable
[13:20:30] <Sendoushi> most of the times is decx :)
[13:20:41] <decx> but if i want to do transition: translateX(value) that doesnt fly
[13:20:55] <Sendoushi> oh with a specific value?
[13:21:04] <decx> yes
[13:21:13] <Sendoushi> well that is more tricky yes
[13:21:20] <decx> so my thought was
[13:21:21] <Velveeta> calc! :D
[13:21:41] <Sendoushi> calc is a powerful weapon yes. i should remember it more often :p
[13:21:42] <Velveeta> i have no clue what the modern performance hits are of using css functions like calc and attr
[13:21:43] <decx> if chrome, blah = -webkit, and then css(blah+'transition')
[13:22:03] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: the thing is... in modern day apps you already use a lot of javascript
[13:22:10] <Sendoushi> you don't want to bloat it more
[13:22:30] <Sendoushi> since browsers already do a good job threading stuff...
[13:22:32] <Velveeta> decx: http://cssprefixer.appspot.com/ .. boom, problem solved
[13:22:42] <Sendoushi> css + js is better than js x 2 :)
[13:23:02] <decx> that's just to sanitize css Velveeta
[13:23:25] <Velveeta> oh yeah, damnit, that's a command line utility
[13:23:32] <Velveeta> there's one for the browser, i'll find it
[13:23:40] <decx> yeah i know the one
[13:24:51] <Velveeta> if you could get everything moved into the css, you could just use grunt-autoprefixer :D
[13:24:57] <decx> i guess a polyfill like this is better practise than a .css(prefix+'transition', function) hack
[13:25:14] <Sendoushi> decx that is bad
[13:25:34] <Sendoushi> because that way you're repainting (correct if wrong) for each prefix
[13:25:48] <Sendoushi> if you want to do such just do a string and apply the style
[13:25:53] <decx> it's repainting anyway
[13:26:02] <Sendoushi> but at least you repaint only one time
[13:26:07] <Sendoushi> not one for each prefix
[13:26:26] <kev999> This is like battle of the Titans - I'm getting answers to problems I havent had yet - good to watch though :-)
[13:26:34] <Velveeta> you can apply an object map of css key/values through the css function and paint once
[13:26:47] <Sendoushi> oh yeah yeah an object yes :)
[13:26:52] <Sendoushi> that is the best approach
[13:27:01] <decx> i just dont want to do .css('transition',value).css('-webkit-transition',value).css('-o-transition')
[13:27:04] <Max-P> Arent unknown properties just ignored anyway? Changing an unknown property should cause a repaint at all
[13:27:05] <decx> that's ridiculous
[13:27:13] <Sendoushi> decx: that repaints in each css
[13:27:35] <decx> well i'd put it in one css() with {} but the point stands ;)
[13:27:37] <Sendoushi> you better do css({ 'transition': value, '-webkit-transition': value})
[13:27:43] <Sendoushi> ok ok :)
[13:27:58] <Velveeta> just use flash!
[13:28:02] <Velveeta> flash ALL the things!
[13:28:03] <Sendoushi> lol
[13:28:31] <jphase> I only code for IE4 anyway
[13:28:36] <Sendoushi> lol
[13:28:46] <jphase> don't laugh, it's the best browser!
[13:28:47] <jphase> :D
[13:28:57] <Sendoushi> netscape!
[13:28:58] <Velveeta> why bother coding for anything else? aol is gonna rule the world anyway, and they're on board
[13:29:00] <jphase> haha
[13:29:03] <jphase> was just going to say nutscrape
[13:29:07] <kev999> can't you feed the css object into a function for it to return the appropriate browser specific code ?
[13:29:12] <decx> i will put my value function separately and put css({ } with a million prefixes in there... but teeth will be grinded ;)
[13:29:19] <jphase> AOL 2.5 master edition ftw!
[13:29:26] <Sendoushi> kev999: that is a solution but for that you need detection and bla bla bla and... why?
[13:29:35] <Sendoushi> you better just apply all the transitions
[13:30:10] <decx> get cracking chrome, yustill need -webkit for everything
[13:30:51] <decx> mobile css dev is all -webkit everyday, it's disgusting
[13:30:57] <Sendoushi> the worst still is firefox with svg icon fonts or whatever fonts
[13:31:04] <Sendoushi> in windows... it just renders badly
[13:31:09] <Sendoushi> at least chrome has solutions! :P
[13:31:21] <decx> chrome on windows cant even do font antialiasing
[13:31:35] <decx> it's been a bug for years
[13:31:45] <decx> on specific fonts that is
[13:32:11] <decx> mainly google webfonts for that matter
[13:32:14] <decx> is that irony?
[13:32:38] <Max-P> I think the Chrome devs proposed to drop all the -webkit prefixes a while back and just use the unprefixed versions and enable them manually in chrome://flags/, but it was rejected because implementing unprefixed versions of unfinished CSS specs could cause issues is too widespead
[13:32:41] <Velveeta> LOUD NOISES!
[13:33:08] <Sendoushi> decx: it doesn't have font aliasing true but svg fonts work perfectly
[13:33:15] <Sendoushi> i've been researching that for like... 2 months :)
[13:33:19] <decx> i love lamp
[13:33:37] <Sendoushi> IE works perfectly with EOT, chrome with SVG font, firefox... with none
[13:33:45] <decx> i don't but couldn't resist the reference
[13:34:09] <BillCriswell> PANDA WATCH
[13:34:29] <decx> ye i rewatched the first one and it's still fun
[13:34:35] <decx> what a let down the second one was
[13:34:53] <BillCriswell> I tried to get an interview with him, but they said no, you can't do that he's a live bear, he will literally rip your face off.
[13:35:01] <BillCriswell> Hey, you're making me look stupid. Get out here, Panda Jerk!
[13:35:12] <BillCriswell> I didn't see the second one yet.
[13:35:23] <Velveeta> Ie7... 60% of the time, it works every time
[13:35:52] <decx> ie7 would be brick tamland
[13:36:02] <Velveeta> lol
[13:36:04] <BillCriswell> I wish ie7 worked 60% of the time.
[13:36:08] <Velveeta> spooning mayo into the toaster
[13:36:25] <BillCriswell> I made it through IE5.5. I can make it through anything.
[13:36:32] <decx> i ate fiberglass insulation
[13:36:38] <decx> it wasnt cotton candy like the man said
[13:36:55] <Velveeta> billcriswell: 5.5 was a walk in the part compared to 5.0
[13:36:58] <Velveeta> park*
[13:37:15] <BillCriswell> Didn't 5 have a really short life span?
[13:37:28] <BillCriswell> Well, less than 5.5
[13:37:35] <Velveeta> yeah i think so
[13:37:45] <decx> easier times though
[13:38:02] <BillCriswell> "Microsoft spent over 100 million dollars (USD) a year[10] in the late 1990s, with over 1000 people working on IE by 1999 during the development of IE5."
[13:38:10] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha, "IE or GTFO"
[13:38:15] <decx> just whip up a tabledesign in dreamweaver and use flashfxp to upload it
[13:38:38] <Velveeta> with 1000 devs on that project, it's no wonder it was a fucking disaster
[13:38:47] <Velveeta> the logistics of code merges had to be a fucking nightmare
[13:39:04] <decx> the commit history later became the script to the matrix
[13:39:19] <Velveeta> "whooooa"
[13:39:46] <duch_lunch> woah, over 1000 people?!
[13:39:53] <duch_kazatel> no thank you.
[13:40:51] <BillCriswell> I doubt it was 1000 people writing code. There's like designers and stuff in there and project managers I hope.
[13:40:55] <Velveeta> this is one of the greatest keanu meme images i ever saw: http://i.imgur.com/VU3exb9.jpg

[13:43:07] <decx> kids falling down is always funny
[13:43:18] <BillCriswell> You need the sound to really find it hilarious.
[13:43:21] <kev999> hope the dog's OK
[13:43:31] <BillCriswell> If it wasn't for the sound she makes it wouldn't be nearly as funny.
[13:44:20] <duch_kazatel> This is the funniest thing I think I've ever seen on the internet for me: www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVXKKaWJTls
[13:44:49] <duch_kazatel> it's funny because you think something different might happen, then you realize it won't.,

[13:46:06] <jphase> so much preparation just to fail
[13:46:17] <Sendoushi> Velveeta: more css than javascript :P
[13:46:19] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: That is classic.
[13:47:01] <Velveeta> this is css: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[13:47:25] <duch_kazatel> yessss
[13:47:29] <BillCriswell> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc9xq-TVyHI The previous link I posted may be what I think is the funniest... but this just blows my mind.

[13:48:06] <BillCriswell> Still think that dog is a robot.
[13:48:08] <Velveeta> no me gusta!
[13:48:23] <Velveeta> dogs aren't supposed to dance like people, they're dogs! stop trying to be people, dogs!
[13:48:40] <BillCriswell> It's really amazing
[13:48:56] <Velveeta> i, for one, welcome our new dancing canine overlords
[13:49:00] <_rooster_> i am having a strange problem with my jquery in my rails app.  i upgraded to rails 4 and ever since then all of my jquery stuff gives me TypeError $(...) function is not a function
[13:49:04] <BillCriswell> It would be adorable.
[13:49:14] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/RrlVWel.gif
[13:49:22] <Velveeta> hahahahaha
[13:49:22] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha
[13:49:37] <BillCriswell> _rooster_: Is jQuery defined?
[13:49:50] <BillCriswell> Like if you open up the console and type it in.
[13:50:43] <_rooster_> BillCriswell i THINK so.  i thought the jquery gem took care of that.
[13:51:04] <BillCriswell> _rooster_: Not too familiar with the rails side of it. =/
[13:52:54] <Sendoushi> afk for top gear
[13:56:57] <Velveeta> and afk working on a blog post
[13:57:46] <tucan> im following a tutorial and it's not working, why is this? http://jsfiddle.net/F2CUu/
[14:00:22] <Velveeta> tucan: you weren't including jquery in that jsfiddle
[14:12:48] <tucan> Velveeta: oh lol
[14:18:21] <decx> Velveeta btw jquery wasn't the problem with the prefix thing, since 1.8 css() returns the right prefix automagically. i had an easy mistake in a cssfile but didnt check there or in the chrome inspector first before suspecting css() ;)
[14:18:53] <Velveeta> decx: since 1.8 css auto-prefixes for you?
[14:18:58] <Velveeta> that's .... awesome :D
[14:19:07] <decx> ye i never tried it before
[14:19:14] <decx> but just confirmed in chrome
[14:19:19] <decx> automagic -webkit
[14:21:43] <Velveeta> well go jquery :)
[14:28:12] <amaroks> what the hell is "non-printing ASCII - "SOH"   (#001)" 1 million search on Google and No clear result on how to type that in my string!
[14:28:59] <duch_kazatel> amaroks huh?
[14:29:23] <amaroks> duch_kazatel:  Yes what is none-printing ASCII - SOH #11
[14:30:10] <duch_kazatel> no idea where you got #11, but SOH is "start of heading"
[14:31:28] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue you're having?
[14:32:35] <supsup> Question: Why is doing this a bad idea....it must be ! http://jsfiddle.net/WpAj4/
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> supsup i'd cache $(this).data("resumecounter")
[14:34:12] <duch_kazatel> do something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/WpAj4/1/
[14:34:26] <duch_kazatel> though even that could be leaner./
[14:35:08] <supsup> it does not work.
[14:35:15] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[14:35:38] <supsup> nothing was just messing around
[14:35:44] <supsup> just seemed odd.
[14:35:55] <duch_kazatel> it's really long.
[14:35:59] <duch_kazatel> and overly verbose.
[14:36:27] <supsup> was just wondering if that is a common way to use .data
[14:36:29] <supsup> basically
[14:36:42] <supsup> to store on undefined then use as a counter
[14:36:59] <supsup> to avoid using a function with clousre
[14:39:46] <supsup> the way you do it, it creates a new var resumeCount everytime
[14:39:53] <supsup> so it is always reset to undefined
[14:39:55] <supsup> so will always be 1
[14:40:50] <supsup> tho hurm. seems odd should work;
[14:43:19] <Velveeta> i've never seen data used for that, i myself use closures to do that sort of thing
[14:43:21] <supsup> ah yours works if you do ++resumeCount
[14:43:53] <duch_kazatel> err, whoops.
[14:43:54] <duch_kazatel> my bad.
[14:44:25] <supsup> yah np was just curious anyway
[14:45:00] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, use a closure for that insetead of a data attribute.
[14:46:48] <decx> oh you mean like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/WpAj4/2/
[14:50:00] <supsup> don't think that’s what he meant, but maybe
[14:51:06] <decx> well you don't have to create a var before the 2 separate functions so that's kinda nice
[14:51:18] <decx> probably good enough if you don't need to be extrafast
[14:51:26] <decx> but data() should be pretty damn fast
[14:51:31] <supsup> yah it's cool
[15:12:33] <b-lew> Is it possible to do something like this?
[15:12:33] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/8720407
[15:13:02] <b-lew> but then deregister that script if its mobile or smaller than 1023
[15:15:16] <Velveeta> b-lew: this might interest you: http://css-tricks.com/enquire-js-media-query-callbacks-in-javascript/
[15:17:18] <b-lew> Thanks!
[15:18:12] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[15:33:09] <tucan> When I have  var j = {foo : bar};  how would i grab each of these things
[15:33:17] <tucan> not really what to call it
[15:33:53] <tucan> i know  j.foo would be bar
[15:34:05] <tucan> but what about grabbing "foo"
[15:34:23] <tucan> (i forgot the double quotes
[15:34:26] <decx> it's called a key
[15:36:35] <tucan> how do get that key string?
[15:37:06] <tucan> i tried  j.keys() and it's undefined
[15:39:36] <decx> keys() is underscore, when you loop through your array that's the uhm key
[15:39:51] <decx> like http://jsfiddle.net/decx/36Zk3/
[15:41:32] <tucan> what if there's like only one pair of key/value like in my example
[15:41:32] <tucan> is there a special thing without looping
[15:42:06] <decx> oh like foo[1].key
[15:42:12] <tucan> yea
[15:42:13] <decx> hm i thought there was something like that
[15:42:18] <decx> cant remember
[15:51:36] <tucan> what if im in the loop and want to print "bar" based on the p  key
[15:52:51] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:53:03] <grafi> foo[p]?
[15:53:04] <grafi> :D
[15:53:08] <grafi> hi duch_kazatel
[15:53:21] <tucan> also, should i use $.each
[15:53:34] <duch_kazatel> tucan nope.
[15:53:40] <duch_kazatel> tucan use a for loop if possible.
[15:53:43] <duch_kazatel> .each() is sloooow
[15:53:43] <tucan> ok
[15:53:57] <grafi> var in is slow too though
[15:54:05] <grafi> at least thats what im told
[15:54:15] <grafi> for in even
[15:55:01] <duch_kazatel> not as slow though.
[15:55:18] <grafi> how does $.each work then?
[15:55:29] <grafi> for in + magic?
[15:55:30] <grafi> :p
[15:55:40] <duch_kazatel> for in with jquery ;)
[15:55:44] <grafi> :P
[16:07:38] <NaN> any help with the context 'this' using 'on' >> http://jsfiddle.net/jRL8n/
[16:13:05] <jsharpminor> var count = $("#" + itemName).parent().parent().parent().list("li:visible").length;
[16:13:20] <jsharpminor> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'list'
[16:13:24] <jsharpminor> What am I doing wrong?
[16:14:23] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor try remove one parent() at a time and seeing when it works.
[16:15:11] <jsharpminor> well it just worked with children() instead of list() but it returned "0" and I realized it's because all the children of the great-grandparent are <div>s not <li>s
[16:16:15] <jsharpminor> I think I wanted find() not list()... it doesn't seem there is such method as list()
[16:16:16] <jsharpminor> lol
[16:16:18] <jsharpminor> silly mistake
[16:27:57] <whatthepoop> I assume that when working with html5 video events one should be using the event's 'target' values rather than 'originalEvent.target' for consistency across browsers? for example, 'evt.target.currentTime' instead of 'evt.originalEvent.target.currentTime'?
[16:29:17] <shoky> it's also shorter
[16:31:07] <whatthepoop> shoky: yes, but originalEvent is the version of the browser's native event, correct? so there's a chance that some events might be named differently across browsers, and using 'target' uses jquery's normalized name?
[16:32:45] <tucan> i dont know what im doing wrong here
[16:32:46] <shoky> target is just a reference to an element, it's not a name, so donno what you mean. but yes, "event" is jquery's normalized event object
[16:33:16] <shoky> donno if event.target would ever be different than event.originalEvent.target
[16:33:34] <whatthepoop> shoky: ah, ok, I was assuming here, so I may very well be wrong
[16:33:45] <tucan> http://jsfiddle.net/5xKj3/1/   im expecting the  <p id="message"> stuff to be added but it's not, why?
[16:34:36] <guide_X> how do I detect a dynamically added element in a div
[16:35:03] <duch_kazatel> tucan start here: http://jsfiddle.net/5xKj3/3/
[16:35:30] <guide_X> like this if($("#mydiv").finddynamicdiv(".myclass") == true) { or similar
[16:36:01] <duch_kazatel> guide_X are you trying to test if it's there?
[16:36:09] <guide_X> yes
[16:36:18] <shoky> tucan what's $message
[16:36:22] <duch_kazatel> because you can do $("#mydiv").find(".myclass").length > 0
[16:36:32] <guide_X> hmm let me try that thanks.
[16:37:27] <duch_kazatel> in fact you can do if ($("#mydiv").find(".myclass").length) and that should work, too.
[16:37:29] <guide_X> it worked!
[16:37:29] <guide_X> thanks
[16:37:32] <tucan> shoky:  I expect $message to have the string "The word is: abdominal and translation is 복부의"
[16:37:50] <shoky> tucan:  you're putting that into "message"  not "$message"
[16:38:05] <shoky> tucan: hence:  Uncaught ReferenceError: $message is not defined
[16:38:06] <jsharpminor> I'm trying to find how many <li> items in a hidden <div> are set to be visible when the div reappears.
[16:38:15] <tucan> oh
[16:38:18] <guide_X> works perfectly
[16:38:24] <jsharpminor> I'm using find("li:visible") which returns 0, obviously.
[16:38:34] <jsharpminor> Is there another way to do it?
[16:38:36] <duch_kazatel> jsharpminor they have to be visible.
[16:38:59] <shoky> another way to do it:  use classes
[16:39:09] <duch_kazatel> you might be able to copy everything to a document fragment and unhide content in that instead.
[16:39:10] <jsharpminor> shoky: of course.
[16:40:44] <guide_X> ok one more, how to remove dynamically created element
[16:41:01] <shoky> `api remove
[16:41:01] <guide_X> .remove() or .remove(".div") isn't working
[16:41:01] <b-ot> shoky: .remove(): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:41:15] <shoky> works for me
[16:41:26] <guide_X> hmm ok, ill try again, thanks 1 sec..
[16:41:33] <shoky> .remove()  that is
[16:41:39] <duch_kazatel> $('.elementsToRemove').remove();
[16:41:52] <guide_X> $("#div1").find(".div2").remove(); right
[16:42:17] <duch_kazatel>  $("#div1").remove('.div2'); should work, too.
[16:42:24] <guide_X> hmm ok..
[16:42:31] <shoky> really? didnt know that
[16:42:49] <duch_kazatel> yeah you can pass a filter.
[16:42:56] <duch_kazatel> oh actually.
[16:43:02] <shoky> yea its a filter
[16:43:04] <duch_kazatel> nevermind, you'll have to do the .find() first.
[16:43:06] <duch_kazatel> yeah i spaced.
[16:43:06] <shoky> not a finder
[16:43:19] <shoky> but didnt know about the filter either
[16:43:23] <duch_kazatel> yup - guide_X $("#div1").find(".div2").remove(); should work.
[16:43:38] <tucan> is it stupid to be using dollar sign in front of variables like $var, i keep doing that cuz im used to perl
[16:43:44] <shoky> yes
[16:43:48] <jsharpminor> I know how to move the last element of an li to its sibling li. Is there a way to move the last X elements rather than just one?
[16:43:50] <duch_kazatel> tucan you should do it if they're jquery objects.
[16:44:34] <shoky> jsharpminor if you select them , you can move them
[16:45:59] <duch_kazatel> aaaah i want to know if I'm going to get this promotion or not.
[16:46:02] <duch_kazatel> cripes
[16:46:40] <snover> duch_kazatel: i asked your boss, they said maybe
[16:46:51] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:47:18] <shoky> whatcha wanna get promoted to
[16:47:27] <duch_kazatel> Senior Developer
[16:47:44] <shoky> sounds like a headache
[16:47:47] <duch_kazatel> manager man said it should happen just fine but he had to check with the director.
[16:47:48] <shoky> good luck :P
[16:48:03] <duch_kazatel> and of course manager man was working from home today.
[16:48:32] <duch_kazatel> and thank you, shoky.  it's not like I'm not happy, I just want to know if it's going to happen.
[16:50:59] <shoky> `8ball
[16:51:01] <shoky> ?8ball
[16:51:02] <shoky> 8ball
[16:51:05] <shoky> b-ot: 8ball
[16:51:05] <shoky> motherfucker
[16:51:11] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[16:56:15] <shoky> `kickflip
[17:02:24] <tucan> regarding the last paste, my friend says "create a reverse lookup map so you don't need to use a loop."
[17:02:29] <tucan> what does he mean?
[17:02:43] <tucan> how can i do it without looping?
[17:03:25] <duch_kazatel> who is your friend?
[17:03:37] <Velveeta> his name is phil
[17:03:40] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:03:45] <Velveeta> Phil McRevis
[17:03:53] <tucan> haha
[17:03:53] <duch_kazatel> *Phillip McCrevis
[17:03:58] <Velveeta> there ya go ;)
[17:03:59] <duch_kazatel> friends with Mike Oxlong
[17:04:09] <Velveeta> is mike's last name in hex?
[17:04:14] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[17:04:29] <Velveeta> friends with ("Mike oxlong", 10) ftfy
[17:05:03] <duch_kazatel> we have a dude here whose last name is "Boychuk" - I like to call him Manthrow.  or Mancharles.
[17:05:12] <Velveeta> so tucan, i can tell you what a reverse lookup map is, but am not familiar w/ the use case, so don't know if it'll save you looping or not
[17:05:35] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: i probably would've gone w/ sweetchuck.. from police academy :D
[17:05:40] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[17:06:28] <tucan> Velveeta: sure show me
[17:06:47] <Velveeta> tucan: i'll whip up a fiddle
[17:10:38] <Velveeta> tucan: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/6kePN/
[17:10:51] <Velveeta> so a reverse lookup map is just a reversal of another object map
[17:10:58] <Velveeta> you use it to lookup data in the opposite direction
[17:11:32] <Velveeta> if you don't have one like that, you'd have to loop over your object to find which value it corresponded to
[17:13:31] <tucan> you mean if my object had  english : korean and i wanted to search korean to english?
[17:13:37] <tucan> and visa versa?
[17:15:00] <Velveeta> yepyep
[17:15:09] <tucan> oh ok then that makes sense now
[17:15:14] <tucan> why he suggested that
[17:16:00] <Velveeta> just remember that you're using twice the memory
[18:59:17] <olsonea> anyone worked with jeditable?
[18:59:53] <parzo> Apologies for the newbie questions but is there any way for me to grab the text "Silver Flower Pot" and store it in a variable from this snippet using jQuery? <p id="productdetailname">Silver Flower Pot</p>
[19:00:07] <olsonea> i'm trying to figure out how it structures the DOM, but when i try to inspect element with Firebug, jeditable cancels the edit and the DOM changes
[19:18:15] <tona> hello guys
[19:18:19] <tona> good nigh
[19:18:47] <tona> one question how can i create a grid with jquery , add, remove, edit,
[19:21:08] <olsonea> parzo: i think $.(#productdetailname).text() will do it
[19:21:22] <parzo> olsonea: much appreciated
[19:21:28] <olsonea> well, will get the value
[19:21:43] <olsonea> var name = $....
[19:22:01] <parzo> so var $productName = $('#productdetailname').text();
[19:22:45] <olsonea> var productName = $("#productdetailname").text();
[19:23:25] <olsonea> it's not php; variables don't start with $ in js/jQuery
[19:23:29] <tona> could someone guide me how to start to create a grid using jquery
[19:23:37] <parzo> ah ok thanks for that!
[19:24:01] <olsonea> tona: check this out: http://datatables.net/
[20:08:40] <mdev> $( ".box_number" )[0].click();
[20:08:46] <mdev> says can't call click of undefined
[20:08:51] <mdev> how I avoid that error
[20:10:21] <systemfault> Well.. you need to understand that calling [0] on a jquery object, unwraps the jQuery object.. and returns a "normal DOM node"
[20:10:42] <systemfault> Instead of [0], use .eq(0)
[20:12:29] <mdev> thanks
[21:57:51] <hd1> new to jquery -- what is wrong with http://news.d8u.us's javascript, I want to load a given URL/filename on click inside the provided div (with id 'map')
[22:12:34] <Uhkis> hd1: your jquery src is incorrect
[22:57:55] <Starcraftmazter> hi is it a problem to have this id in a jquery selector? "widget-emergency_contacts-2-images[0]-trigger"
[23:14:03] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: you should never have [] in classes or id's
[23:14:15] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: cause yes that will need to be escaped
[23:14:43] <Cork> $("widget-emergency_contacts-2-images\\[0\\]-trigger")
[23:14:51] <Cork> (you need dubble escape)
[23:17:42] <hd1> ok, I have a div with id 'map' and I'd like to fill it with the contents of 'map.html', my code to do so is "$.get('map.html', function(data) { $('map').html(data); });"
[23:17:55] <hd1> does anyone see what's wrong with this code?
[23:18:14] <Cork> hd1: your adding hte data to the element map
[23:18:17] <Cork> not the id
[23:18:21] <Cork> (missing #)
[23:18:55] <sterlo> I have a list of deferred AJAX requests and pass them to $.when -- I would like to use .done or .then and have a single function handle all responses. Right now what I am seeing is I need .done( f1, f2, f3 ... ) -- which sucks. Anyone have ideas?
[23:20:04] <Cork> sterlo: .apply(null, arr)
[23:20:22] <Cork> meaning $.when.apply(null, arr)
[23:20:42] <sterlo> so i have $.when.apply( -- which works great on the initial deferred array - BUT not on .done
[23:21:04] <Cork> sterlo: what?
[23:21:27] <Cork> sterlo: .apply just converts an array to an argument list
[23:21:38] <sterlo> Cork: $.when.apply( AJAXARRAY ).then( function(results) { ... do stuff .... } );
[23:21:46] <Cork> no
[23:21:53] <Cork> you missed the null part
[23:22:04] <sterlo> sorry - i have it
[23:22:06] <sterlo> lol i swear
[23:22:12] <sterlo> one sec
[23:23:10] <sterlo> Cork: https://gist.github.com/grok/ab60bbcfa1fbbdc449a0
[23:23:34] <Cork> js> function a(b,c,d) { print(b + c + d); } a.apply(null, ['this is', ' ', 'what happens']);
[23:23:38] <b-ot> Cork: this is what happens
[23:24:30] <Cork> $.when($ajax_calls[0], $ajax_calls[1], $ajax_calls[2], $ajax_calls[3]) works
[23:24:38] <Cork> $.when.apply would
[23:25:06] <Cork> sterlo: also the result you see is expected
[23:25:18] <Cork> (just saw the comment section)
[23:25:26] <sterlo> ok - sweet
[23:25:40] <Cork> cause as you give multiple calls to don
[23:25:50] <Cork> it gives an array for each section
[23:26:04] <sterlo> so there's no way to have it use one function for every call?
[23:26:23] <Cork> when isn't meant to work like that
[23:26:25] <sterlo> key thing here being - the amount of ajax calls will vary...so defining a set amount of handlers after .done sucks
[23:26:36] <sterlo> is there a different approach I should go with?
[23:26:45] <Cork> if you want it to be called oce for each call just use a named function and pass it
[23:26:58] <sterlo> trying
[23:27:01] <sterlo> sec
[23:27:10] <Cork> function callback() {}  for(...) { $.ajax(...).done(callback); }
[23:27:31] <Cork> done is to wait for all the calls to complete
[23:27:33] <Cork> sorry
[23:27:36] <Cork> i meant when
[23:34:32] <sterlo> Cork: I'll just add .done(function(data) {omg(data)}) within the AJAX array so each item will call this singular function and pass its data to it
[23:34:44] <sterlo> Cork: thanks for the help!
[23:44:46] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[23:44:52] <Starcraftmazter> is there a way to execute newly appended javascrupt?
[23:44:59] <Starcraftmazter> i was thinking of wrapping it in a function and calling it
[23:45:22] <Cork> ?api getScript
[23:45:22] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[23:45:25] <Cork> opps
[23:45:30] <Cork> ?api jQuery.getScript
[23:45:30] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.getScript(): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[23:45:51] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: if you mean inline scripts, they should be called by default when they are appended to the page
[23:49:54] <Cork> Starcraftmazter: http://jsbin.com/rizow/1/edit
[23:52:38] <Starcraftmazter> ic
[23:52:39] <Starcraftmazter> ty
