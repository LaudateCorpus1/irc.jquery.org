[03:43:00] <dhecar> Hello, how can I apply css style to different div id in a page based in array of configuration? for example, in the array I have ID:color information. Thanls
[03:49:51] <Cork> dhecar: i would recommend having the style as classes in your css and then setting the classes as needed on the different elements
[03:50:05] <Cork> else your only option is to use inline css through .css()
[04:15:09] <dhecar> Hi, the information of the array is comming from a db and is changing.  In the page I have about 300 diferent ID. Each, have to be filled with the color that I get  from the db

[15:56:36] <flying_fish> lines, circles, squares
[15:56:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##javascript
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:57:32] <flying_fish> why)
[15:58:17] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty generic, broad question that doesn't have anything to do with jQuery :)
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> you'll likely get more help over there.

[16:25:48] <gambl0r3> hello?
[16:32:56] <gambl0r3> robert, you there?
[16:33:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:33:04] <gambl0r3> sup?
[16:33:11] <gambl0r3> how was your weekend
[16:33:13] <robertmaxrees> did you need help?
[16:33:50] <gambl0r3> not yet, hows your weekend?
[16:33:55] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[16:33:56] <robertmaxrees> it was ok?
[16:35:20] <gambl0r3> cool
[16:37:39] <fprophet> how does $.ajax({dataType: "script", ...}); work under the hood? specifically the script part. is it eval?
[16:38:21] <robertmaxrees> could always check out the source.  one sec.
[16:38:31] <pavonia> I think it inserts a <script> tag
[16:39:01] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/script.js
[16:39:43] <fprophet> so it is inserting a script
[16:39:49] <fprophet> neat, i couldnt find this to save my life though :(
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid using it though, tbh.
[16:43:00] <pavonia> Hhm, so it doesn't actually download the file and inserts the code, it just sets the src property to the URL
[17:26:12] <fprophet> it seems like the ajax method is using eval
[17:26:37] <fprophet> it directly calls eval in the global scope
[17:31:03] <robertBusy> that's if it's converting text to script iirc.
[18:11:50] <alturic> Hello. I'm returning an array of objects via AJAX. It is exactly formed as I would expect to use it [{lat: 1.00, lng: -1.00}, {lat: 2.00, lng: -2.00}], however when trying to use it, it's a string. I'm unsure if I need to parse it, stringify, slice it splice it but nothing I've tried can allow me to use it like I would expect.
[18:12:01] <alturic> That expecation would be having an array with 2 keys in it.
[18:12:16] <robertmaxrees> have you tried JSON.parse() ?
[18:13:49] <alturic> JSON.parse returned unexpected token l in JSON at position 2. I think it's choking on lat and lng not being quoted?
[18:13:59] <robertmaxrees> that would do it.
[18:14:09] <robertmaxrees> do you control where you're getting the data from?
[18:14:16] <alturic> I can alter it sure.
[18:14:42] <robertmaxrees> also: you aren't, like, setting weird dataTypes or anything in the $.ajax() settings, right?
[18:14:57] <alturic> I always get crazy with JS because var foo = [{lat: 1.00, lng: -1.00}, {lat: 2.00, lng: -2.00}]  works exactly as expected. :(
[18:15:20] <robertmaxrees> JSON isn't javascript, fwiw :)
[18:15:22] <robertmaxrees> different spec.,
[18:15:50] <alturic> No, I mean I get that part, but I mean how I can take that exact string I posted and run the var foo = ... in console and it works as expected.
[18:16:10] <alturic> I do get how it's JSON being returned vs not at the console but...
[18:16:12] <alturic> ha
[18:16:25] <robertmaxrees> something sounds weird here.
[18:16:35] <robertmaxrees> can you share your $.ajax() call?
[18:16:42] <alturic> It's an axios.get
[18:16:49] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:16:56] <robertmaxrees> so not even jquery
[18:16:56] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:17:30] <alturic> *Technically*, sure.
[18:17:36] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:17:43] <robertmaxrees> there's no "technically" in this case lol.
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> you aren't using jquery for this :)
[18:18:00] <alturic> Isn't Axios coded in... jQuery? o.O
[18:18:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:18:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language.
[18:18:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a library.
[18:19:14] <alturic> So, you think if I use $.get everything will work as expected?
[18:19:22] <alturic> Or $.getJSON*
[18:19:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm saying.
[18:19:41] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out that you're not using jquery while asking for help in #jquery lol
[18:20:04] <robertmaxrees> and without seeing what you're doing, it's hard to help :)
[18:20:10] <alturic> Welllllll, I thought it'd be something with slice, splice, stringify or parse. Ha.
[18:20:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:20:17] <alturic> Hence, jQuery. I apologize.
[18:20:27] <robertmaxrees> jquery also doesn't do anything like that for what you need.
[18:20:46] <robertmaxrees> basically: you never want to try to "parse" poorly-formed responses yourself.
[18:22:31] <alturic> Well, let me ask you this oddity I've noticed. So the JSON response is exactly var foo = [{lat: 1.00, lng: -1.00}, {lat: 2.00, lng: -2.00}]. typeof says it's a string. Ok, great. If I (since I can alter the return data) remove the [ and ], and then do var fooArray = [] and fooArray.push(foo) it inserts double-quotes around the string. So it ends up ["{lat: 1.00, lng: -1.00}, {lat: 2.00, lng: -2.00}"].
[18:22:39] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[18:22:43] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaaay up.
[18:23:01] <alturic> That's why I been going crazy. I thought hey, if I store this *exactly* how I want, and send it over via JSON it will work exactly as it does at a console.
[18:23:07] <robertmaxrees> you're actually doing var foo = [/* some objects */];
[18:23:27] <robertmaxrees> like, you're declaring a var as the response?
[18:24:22] <alturic> I'm not specifically sending "var foo = [ ... ]". I *am* however sending var foo = "[ ... ]"; - Minus the double-quotes of course.
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> what's why.
[18:24:43] <robertmaxrees> kill the "var foo = "
[18:24:46] <robertmaxrees> that's bas.
[18:24:47] <robertmaxrees> *bad
[18:25:21] <robertmaxrees> that's why you can't work with the data - you're not sending back data.  you're sendiong back a variable declaration.
[18:25:35] <alturic> I might have confused you. I am not sending the var foo part.
[18:25:40] <alturic> Sec, fiddle.
[18:25:43] <robertmaxrees> pls
[18:28:08] <alturic> http://jsfiddle.net/stLvbm23/
[18:28:45] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[18:28:57] <robertmaxrees> fix your response.
[18:29:04] <alturic> Eh?
[18:29:09] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid data.
[18:29:15] <alturic> That's valid JSON?
[18:29:25] <robertmaxrees> well, i mean, it's "valid", but it's not really useful.
[18:29:35] <alturic> Hmm, how would you recommend the return?
[18:29:50] <robertmaxrees> does county_polygon need to be one big string?
[18:30:01] <robertmaxrees> or are you expecting multile objects there?
[18:30:02] <alturic> I figured I'd save myself the trouble since this will never change, store it exactly how it's expected to be formatted. :(
[18:30:38] <alturic> But since it's then going to be used to draw polygons on Gmaps. It's supposed to be an array of lat/lng combinations.
[18:30:49] <robertmaxrees> so then make it an array of lat/lng combinations.
[18:30:55] <robertmaxrees> right now it's just a string.
[18:31:10] <alturic> So append and prepend a [ ]?
[18:31:19] <robertmaxrees> more than that.
[18:31:21] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[18:32:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pgof189h/2/
[18:32:07] <robertmaxrees> needs to look like this.
[18:32:50] <robertmaxrees> "county_polygon": [{"foo": 123, "bar": 456}, {"baz": 789, "qux": 321}]
[18:33:17] <alturic> Hmm, the backend is PHP, that's what json_encode returns... o.O
[18:33:30] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to fix up your backend then.
[18:33:37] <robertmaxrees> becuase what you're getting today can't parse.
[18:34:32] <alturic> How do you fix fundamental PHP functions like json_encode? It's almost as if you're saying build the response (PHP) manually, and don't actually json_encode the array.
[18:34:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:35:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean you need to store the data in a format that is conducive to the converted result.
[18:35:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that you've got some kind of type coercion going on somewhere.
[18:35:37] <robertmaxrees> and/or you're using an associative array somewhere, which would explain a lot.
[18:36:13] <alturic> Technically the entire response returned from the DB is an associative array, absolutely.
[18:36:22] <alturic> "entire response" meaning each row.
[18:36:35] <robertmaxrees> meaning the county_polygon?
[18:37:13] <robertmaxrees> wait hold up.
[18:37:45] <alturic> Every column that's returned, so I showed you two rows. With two columns in each row. The actual response is say two rows with ~10 columns in each row, an id, countyname, state, county_polygon.
[18:38:44] <alturic> I've used PHP and JSON for years now, never had an issue like this. I've done nothing differently than ever before, *except* storing an array expecting to save myself headache when it came time to use it, by returning it exactly how it works at a browser console. Ha.
[18:39:58] <alturic> So console.log considers the county_polygon value of the response to be a string. And sure, it absolutely is how it's being returned. I didn't think I'd run into an issue with... converting(?) it to the expected array however.
[18:40:16] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[18:40:18] <robertmaxrees> wait wait wait.
[18:40:29] <robertmaxrees> county_polygon is getting stored in a single column in your DB?
[18:40:33] <alturic> Yes.
[18:40:43] <alturic> LONGTEXT datatype.
[18:40:55] <robertmaxrees> that's your entire problem.
[18:40:59] <robertmaxrees> you can't do it that way :)
[18:41:14] <robertmaxrees> you're storing it as text, so it's getting sent over as text.
[18:41:32] <robertmaxrees> you using MySQL?
[18:41:46] <alturic> Yea, just changing it to JSON will make everything click? lol
[18:41:52] <robertmaxrees> no./
[18:41:57] <alturic> Oh. Dang.
[18:42:01] <robertmaxrees> because you have malformed JSON.
[18:42:12] <robertmaxrees> if you stick [] around, it, you should be fine.
[18:42:27] <robertmaxrees> so wrap with square brackets, and change datatype to JSON
[18:42:36] <alturic> Oh yea, I do indeed have that. Stripping the [ and ] off was after 2 hours of screaming.
[18:42:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:42:59] <robertmaxrees> you want to store a JSON array.
[18:43:14] <alturic> Again, stored it exactly how I expected it work. Just didn't work out that well, and if this simple datatype change works... I'm going to freak. Ha.
[18:43:30] <robertmaxrees> *datatype change + adding the square brackets.
[18:43:35] <robertmaxrees> just to reiterate heh
[18:44:04] <alturic> Already has them at the DB level, I removed it for one entry while trying to see if that was it.
[18:44:09] <robertmaxrees> k
[18:44:21] <alturic> Hmm, ok so problem... :(
[18:44:30] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:44:33] <alturic> Says it's missing a name for object member.
[18:45:08] <alturic> Do I have to wrap it in something like ["polygon": { ... }]? :-/
[18:45:14] <robertmaxrees> no.  that's invalid.
[18:45:21] <robertmaxrees> [{},{}]
[18:45:44] <alturic> That is exactly how it is in the DB, yes.
[18:45:46] <robertmaxrees> and make sure all of your property names are wrapped in double quotes.
[18:45:57] <robertmaxrees> since valid json requires that.
[18:46:06] <alturic> Ahh, lat/lng isn't.
[18:46:13] <robertmaxrees> need to be.
[18:46:49] <alturic> Purely because I'm trying to do this via JSON? Never use that when using this in Google Maps.
[18:47:08] <robertmaxrees> you mean with the google maps library?
[18:47:18] <alturic> I hope this doesn't spam the channel... *cringe*
[18:47:26] <robertmaxrees> you're confusing JSON with JavaScript.
[18:47:31] <robertmaxrees> they have different requirements.
[18:47:52] <alturic> Right, so that's what I mean, it's purely because I'm trying to retrieve this via JSON everything needs to be quoted.
[18:48:06] <robertmaxrees> *store and retrieve as jsonn.
[18:49:03] <alturic> So quoting the lat/lng keys, will work just like:         var triangleCoords = ***[{lat: 25.774, lng: -80.190},{lat: 18.466, lng: -66.118},{lat: 32.321, lng: -64.757}]***;   where everything inside *** is returned from the DB, but lat/lng being quoted? o.O
[18:49:21] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that I follow.
[18:50:29] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kust6apm/2/
[18:50:31] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[18:51:06] <alturic> To make a polygon with Google Maps, you do   var triangleCoords = [{lat: 25.774, lng: -80.190},{lat: 18.466, lng: -66.118},{lat: 32.321, lng: -64.757}]; - So you can see why I stored them all exactly how it works. What I'm saying is that the double-quoting all of the keys is necessary to store as JSON, but (you can tell I'm green with JS) double-quoting them at the DB wouldn't cause issues when trying to use that data inside the var
[18:51:06] <robertmaxrees> though you'd likely leave off the surrounding quotes, so: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3haqzudp/1/
[18:51:21] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[18:51:33] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating 2 completely different concepts.
[18:51:55] <robertmaxrees> Is the google maps documentation for a javascript library?
[18:52:14] <alturic> Oh no, I get they are different, but that's what I'm getting at. DB would have double-quotes. On the front-end side, the double-quotes wouldn't cause problems?
[18:53:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kboewg3q/
[18:53:29] <robertmaxrees> these all do the same thing as far as JS is concerned, so no, the double-quotes won't cause an issue.
[18:53:56] <alturic> Unsure what that question means? The docs are: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polygon-arrays - I was looking to store everything exactly as-is after the = in var triangleCoord = at the DB. So I think you'll follow this logic, my actual var setting would be something akin to var triangleCoord = response.data.county_polygon; since county_polygon contains the data exactly as used to make a polygon.
[18:54:07] <alturic> Got you, on the double-quote!
[18:54:12] <alturic> I think that answers my question.
[18:54:39] <robertmaxrees> js allows no quotes, single quotes, or double quotes.
[18:54:46] <robertmaxrees> JSON always requires double quotes.
