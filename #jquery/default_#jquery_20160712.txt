[00:32:47] <SlizardWizard> I am having trouble setting the default date for a jqueryUI date picker
[00:33:15] <SlizardWizard> for some reason it sets the date to the maximum possible date

[00:34:50] <debe> Hi, I have a problem with twitter embed in iframe refreshing to blank whenever it gets focus again - how do I solve this? The site is - shalomlab.ph/test - in 'Latest News' section below that page.
[00:41:57] <SlizardWizard> well i fixed by first converting it into a date object with new date()
[00:43:47] <ChrisBinge> When I dynamically add input fields to the dom they do not inherit the functionality of the script
[00:44:09] <ChrisBinge> https://jsfiddle.net/yxceajLk/ should I wrap it in something other then document.ready? that is my guess
[01:08:04] <bayman> http://download.jqueryui.com/download
[01:08:05] <bayman> not working
[01:51:51] <Cork> ChrisBinge: you have to use delegated event listeners
[02:18:13] <DreamStiffler> Hi guys
[02:18:21] <DreamStiffler> can anyone help me simplify this?
[02:18:22] <DreamStiffler> http://pastebin.com/516ZFpFX
[02:50:22] <ChrisBinge> why won't the "add item" button work after I click the "add section"? https://jsfiddle.net/yxceajLk/
[03:02:17] <Duikb00t> o/
[03:21:41] <Cork> ChrisBinge: like i said before, you need to use delegated event handler for dynamically added elements
[03:29:07] <Duikb00t> I tried already some things but im not yet there :D https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/3/
[03:29:33] <Duikb00t> I would like to make a 'add more' and remove' field. When I click Add it feels like I have to click twice,
[03:29:43] <Duikb00t> so I might have missed something.
[03:30:34] <Cork> Duikb00t: you need to delegate add the same way you delegate remove
[03:31:50] <Duikb00t> You mean like this? : https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/4/
[03:33:33] <Cork> Duikb00t: also you need to animate the clone not the latest group https://jsfiddle.net/2ec0gdLs/5/
[03:34:38] <Cork> and i would think you want to use $(this).closest('.product_data') instead of latestGroup
[03:35:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/2ec0gdLs/6/
[03:35:45] <Duikb00t> Oh that's great already, thanks Cork.
[03:35:50] <Duikb00t> 1 UX question.
[03:36:01] <Duikb00t> Should I add the 'add' button outside the group?
[03:36:14] <Cork> Duikb00t: it depends on how you want to do it
[03:36:25] <Cork> if you always want to add them to the end (like you did before) then ya
[03:36:34] <Cork> if you add it after the current row like now it works either way
[03:36:47] <Duikb00t> I always want to add them on the end.
[03:37:01] <Cork> then the add button shouldn't be on the row
[03:37:25] <Cork> oh, btw you want to add type="button" to your buttons
[03:37:33] <Cork> else they become submit buttons
[03:37:50] <Cork> (and why you need e.preventDefault())
[03:38:07] <Duikb00t> I won't need htat indeed
[03:38:08] <Duikb00t> 1 sec
[03:38:12] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/2ec0gdLs/7/
[03:38:41] <MXBrandon> ##bootstrap
[03:38:48] <MXBrandon> ack, sorry
[03:41:03] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/11/    like that
[03:41:27] <Duikb00t> oh no
[03:41:46] <Cork> closest needs to be reverted
[03:42:35] <Duikb00t> that's parents?
[03:43:02] <Duikb00t> first
[03:43:04] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/2ec0gdLs/12/
[03:43:21] <Duikb00t> oO :D
[03:43:53] <Duikb00t> Oh like that
[03:46:05] <Duikb00t> Whats the best way to check if there is only 1 item left?
[03:46:20] <Duikb00t> I would like to make sure that if there is only 1 item that's it's not possible to remove it.
[03:46:29] <Cork> i would wrapp the project_data elments in another parent
[03:46:46] <Duikb00t> like. '.project' ?
[03:46:48] <Cork> and just do $('#wrapper').children().length
[03:46:49] <Duikb00t> around it?
[03:46:53] <Duikb00t> oohh
[03:47:19] <Cork> and would make the add line cleaner too
[03:47:30] <Cork> $('#wrapper').append(clone)
[03:50:50] <Duikb00t> wowow
[03:51:02] <Duikb00t> indeed the add butotn is not reacting that good
[03:51:11] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/14/
[03:53:45] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/2ec0gdLs/15/
[03:55:09] <Duikb00t> I dont get this one:   $('.product_data:last').after(clone.hide());
[03:55:27] <Duikb00t> select the latest group of product data ok bu tthen after clone hide?
[03:55:43] <Cork> (check the latest fiddle)
[03:55:56] <Cork> it runs .hide() on the clone before adding it to the dom
[03:56:05] <fattest> I have var items = $(); and in a loop (that gets executed >1000 times) var item = ... items = items.add(item). This freezes my browser until the loop finishes. Is there any other way to store my elements?
[03:56:42] <Cork> fattest: it isn't cause of that line
[03:57:01] <Duikb00t> Why hide on the clone before adding?
[03:57:05] <fattest> Cork: I see. Thank you
[03:57:17] <Cork> Duikb00t: else it won't animate when you show it
[03:57:23] <Duikb00t> Oh ok
[03:57:30] <DreamStiffler> Hi masters. Any chance i can simplify this? http://pastebin.com/RKLV7ppM
[03:57:33] <Duikb00t> It needs to get a display"none' before it can be animated?
[03:58:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: not exactly
[03:58:16] <Cork> Duikb00t: it needs to get the internal state of hidden
[03:58:35] <Cork> .hide() is setting that state AND display: none
[03:58:36] <DreamStiffler> Hey babe
[03:58:38] <DreamStiffler> how are you
[03:58:54] <Cork> Duikb00t: so setting display: none is normally a bad idea
[03:59:08] <Duikb00t> OK :) Yes the internal state should be set to hidden.
[04:00:01] <Cork> Duikb00t: also in the latest fiddle the row isn't hidden by default
[04:00:07] <Cork> Duikb00t: the wrapper is the hidden one
[04:00:09] <fattest> Cork:  This is what I have http://hastebin.com/femebowuqu.xml is there any way to make it faster?
[04:01:06] <Cork> fattest: make a jsfiddle
[04:01:35] <Duikb00t> Ok makes sense
[04:01:51] <Duikb00t> How would you handle multiple checkboxes? ( I have 15 rendered from a PHP back-end )
[04:02:37] <Duikb00t> For example, this is  going wrong but should  I structure  it like that? https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/16/
[04:02:46] <fattest> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/7ycsb3fa/ (note this is just a extract from my code)
[04:03:24] <Cork> fattest: i meant a working example
[04:03:34] <Cork> where d is included
[04:03:37] <systemfault> fattest: I'd be surprised if that loop was slow :/
[04:03:56] <systemfault> It's not even touching the main DOM tree
[04:03:58] <Cork> the only cost i can see is that jquery has to unwrap the array
[04:04:10] <Cork> but it shouldn't be very slow either
[04:04:37] <Cork> btw new Date().getTime() => Date().now()
[04:04:50] <fattest> ok thanks
[04:04:56] <Cork> opps
[04:04:59] <Cork> btw new Date().getTime() => Date.now()
[04:05:02] <Cork> :)
[04:05:24] <fattest> I'm going to remove the function newItem() and insert the code directly and see where that gets me
[04:05:30] <fattest> There should be less stack frames now
[04:05:39] <systemfault> That said, I wonder how the browser will like 1000 calls to colour.php with a cache breaker.
[04:06:11] <systemfault> fattest: You have 1000 items?
[04:06:26] <fattest> systemfault: hmm, i'll also try removing that
[04:06:28] <Cork> systemfault: the time there should be quite a few of the same time
[04:06:38] <fattest> colour.php generates a random image
[04:06:53] <systemfault> Cork: Right.. only ms resolution
[04:06:53] <Cork> fattest: you might want to grab the time before the loop and reuse that
[04:06:56] <fattest> and I need to put the newDate in the end or else every item will have the same background colour
[04:06:59] <Cork> systemfault: exactly
[04:07:23] <Cork> fattest: also why not just generate the background in js?
[04:07:35] <fattest> I didn't consider that
[04:07:45] <Cork> would be a lot faster then fetching a server image
[04:07:56] <fattest> ok
[04:08:02] <fattest> i'll see how this runs
[04:08:32] <Cork> Duikb00t: the wrapper is an id, you need to grab it relative to the checkbox instead of using an id
[04:21:14] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/17/
[04:21:15] <Duikb00t> omg
[04:22:36] <Duikb00t> Weird things going one :D https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/18/
[04:30:03] <Duikb00t> Cork: I think I might have to implement 'this' everywhere
[04:30:25] <Cork> Duikb00t: ya, you have to make it relative to the checkbox like i said
[04:30:39] <helloNL> Hi, we are installing jQuery ui through npm, the problem is that the build js file is missing after installing it with npm install. Does anyone know why?
[04:31:21] <helloNL> I mean with that the jquery-ui.js file
[04:32:30] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/2ec0gdLs/19/
[04:32:54] <Duikb00t> omg your so fast :D I was working on that part: $(this).parent().nextAll('.wrapper').first().slideToggle(this.checked);
[04:32:56] <Duikb00t> :D
[04:33:00] <Duikb00t> nextAll oh
[04:33:09] <Duikb00t> I was trying with next
[04:33:26] <Cork> Duikb00t: next will only find the next sibling
[04:33:39] <Cork> and only if that sibling matches the selector (else it returns nothing)
[04:34:48] <Duikb00t> Ok, :D thanks for clearing that out
[04:35:05] <Duikb00t> Now I have to fix the add button i should add it a level/div higher.
[04:39:47] <lilalinuxHamburg> I'm using a library that sets the value of an input. I attached the change() even to that input, but that doesn't fire. Does change() only listen to key presses? What else event could I use?
[04:42:34] <Cork> lilalinuxHamburg: events is for catching user actions
[04:42:44] <Cork> so ya, a script setting a value won't trigger change
[04:42:46] <Duikb00t> omg :D
[04:42:58] <Duikb00t> It started being complicated :D
[04:42:59] <lilalinuxHamburg> Cork: alternatives?
[04:43:00] <Duikb00t> in my heda
[04:43:03] <Duikb00t> head
[04:43:22] <Cork> lilalinuxHamburg: have the script call a callback is normally the better option
[04:43:30] <Cork> lilalinuxHamburg: you can have the script trigger a fake event too
[04:43:34] <lilalinuxHamburg> Cork: not my script :-(
[04:43:38] <Cork> .val().trigger('change')
[04:43:43] <Cork> lilalinuxHamburg: then you have to modify it
[04:43:57] <lilalinuxHamburg> not possible, I'm writing a plugin for a system
[04:44:04] <lilalinuxHamburg> and the lib comes with that system
[04:44:11] <lilalinuxHamburg> it's a user picker
[04:44:25] <Cork> well... then you have to have a user triggering an event
[04:44:42] <Cork> you could modify the script live
[04:44:49] <Cork> wrapping the function making the change for example
[04:45:10] <Cork> but ya, if they don't provide a way to do it, and no fairly easy way to hook into it
[04:45:14] <Cork> then you are out of luck
[04:45:28] <lilalinuxHamburg> :-/
[04:45:33] <lilalinuxHamburg> thank you
[04:45:59] <Cork> lilalinuxHamburg: if they for example do something like function something() {}
[04:46:11] <Duikb00t> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/20/
[04:46:17] <Duikb00t> I got the buttons already yey
[04:46:20] <Cork> and it is called for each time it sets the value you could wrap that function
[04:46:28] <Cork> lilalinuxHamburg: but that is about the only option you have
[04:46:43] <Duikb00t> oh I got it
[04:46:53] <Duikb00t> Cork:  > https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/21/
[04:47:08] <Cork> Duikb00t: please only highlight me if you have a question
[04:47:15] <Cork> i kinda have other things i need to do too
[04:47:43] <Duikb00t> The questoin I have let is
[04:48:09] <Duikb00t> left* is should I count the items that are currently cloned? So I can 'remove' the remove button when there is only 1 item left?
[04:50:53] <Cork> Duikb00t: uh, depends on what you want to do...
[04:51:57] <Duikb00t> I would like to count ( size(); )  how many times a '.product_data' has been rendered
[04:52:24] <Duikb00t> console.log( $(this).find('.product_data').size() );  Alike that
[04:53:09] <DarsVaeda> Hi, I'm running a $.post request and get a 404 so I thought I use .fail() to catch that, but it seems fail is not triggered in that case?
[04:55:13] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it is
[04:55:28] <Cork> fail is triggered for all none 2xx and 3xx responses
[04:55:51] <DarsVaeda> okay, thanks
[04:56:04] <DarsVaeda> then I'll need to check where it's going wrong :)
[05:07:52] <Duikb00t> Cork:  What's the best way to count the rendered 'items' inside the remove handler?
[05:08:18] <Duikb00t> I would like to disable the remove button if : renderedItems == 1
[05:08:55] <Cork> scroll up, i've already answered this
[05:10:32] <Duikb00t> Cork: You mean fiddle 21? ( The count stays at 0 ) oO
[05:11:22] <Duikb00t> Maybe I had to add: id_count++;   inside my add_item

[06:51:53] <BrazenBraden> trying to find all inputs with class name starting with "town"
[06:52:04] <BrazenBraden> original msg:  hey guys. got a couple inputs with classes like "town-1", "town-2" etc and would like to find all of them. Have this code $(elem).find('input[class^="town-"]'); but alas, no cigar.
[06:57:21] <fattest> BrazenBraden: https://jsfiddle.net/vanpLkut/1/ ??
[06:58:28] <BrazenBraden> fattest, so the $.find was the problem?
[06:58:43] <fattest> you don't need to use that
[06:58:47] <fattest> just do $('p
[06:58:52] <fattest> $('p')
[06:59:39] <BrazenBraden> ok. and if i add a class to the wrapping div and only want to look inside there instead of the entire dom?
[07:00:07] <fattest> $('.classname)
[07:00:13] <BrazenBraden> ok, that still works
[07:01:41] <Cork> BrazenBraden: also input doesn't have a close tag
[07:01:54] <Cork> its just <input> not <input></input>
[07:02:06] <BrazenBraden> Cork, apologies, not used to writing standard html anymore lol
[07:02:10] <fattest> How do I slice some elements in my json object? I'm getting d.slice is not a function.  https://jsfiddle.net/4t8bcxaj/
[07:02:46] <Cork> fattest: objects don't have slice only arrays does
[07:02:51] <Cork> so fix your json
[07:03:10] <fattest> i see
[07:03:24] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/4t8bcxaj/2/
[07:03:40] <Cork> and the outer object is pointless the key values are the same as you would get from an array
[07:07:47] <BrazenBraden> weird. my code almost matches the fiddle but it doesnt work. I'll gist my exact code (or do you prefer a different form of pastebin?)
[07:08:05] <Duikb00t> Cork:  https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/26/ Have you a good idea how I can show(); all fields from a checkbox that has been checked?
[07:08:20] <Duikb00t> ( I am now writing some php stuff but when I navigate back ) I would like to show all items that are being filled in.
[07:08:58] <Cork> Duikb00t: that should work by default
[07:09:07] <Cork> (aka. have you tried?)
[07:09:15] <Duikb00t> Yes .. but when you go back
[07:09:26] <Duikb00t> the style display none seems to be attached again
[07:10:45] <BrazenBraden> this is my actual code:  http://hastebin.com/zanonewile.js
[07:11:48] <Cork> BrazenBraden: find('input[class^="town-"]') <-- never EVER do this
[07:11:56] <Cork> split the class into two if you ever need this
[07:12:05] <Cork> class="town value"
[07:12:19] <BrazenBraden> Cork whats wrong with doing ^= ? inefficient?
[07:12:30] <Cork> extremely
[07:12:38] <Cork> class and ids are a hash table in the browser
[07:12:55] <Cork> you circumvented and forced the browser to loop over all elements
[07:12:58] <Cork> fetching the attribute
[07:13:05] <Cork> and regex match the string value
[07:13:34] <Cork> BrazenBraden: but mostly it's horrible code
[07:13:52] <Cork> BrazenBraden: classes are designed to handle this case, so just use thqat
[07:13:55] <Cork> *that
[07:13:58] <BrazenBraden> ok
[07:14:35] <Cork> BrazenBraden: anyway what part of this isn't working?
[07:15:17] <BrazenBraden> i have 3 input fields on the page, town-1, town-2 and town-3 and you can see the console log inside the each loop but that never gets printed
[07:15:27] <Cork> O_o
[07:15:39] <Cork> BrazenBraden: why do they have unique class names??
[07:15:50] <Cork> that should be an id it sounds like
[07:16:09] <BrazenBraden> well, the order is important
[07:16:21] <Cork> ok? and?
[07:16:24] <Duikb00t> Cork:  I found a small issue. The clone rule here:   https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/26/ works but it adds the clone inside the .product_data class isntead of below it
[07:16:46] <Cork> Duikb00t: again, please stop highlighting me all the time
[07:16:58] <BrazenBraden> well, thats about it lol. just wanted a simple way to have any number of towns with their positions all compacted nicely
[07:17:26] <Cork> BrazenBraden: the i would suggest adding the town number in data-town="num"
[07:17:35] <Cork> and just have a class="town"
[07:17:47] <BrazenBraden> yea that is a good idea
[08:16:33] <lilalinuxHamburg> How come ajax.fail isn't triggered on 404, but ajax.error?
[08:17:21] <taplar> fail is the deferred method i believe
[08:18:18] <firevulpes> Hi guys, bit of an odd question but is there any way to add a file to a html file input with jquery (I'm making PDFs client side and need to upload them)
[08:19:10] <taplar> iirc it may be possible some how with canvases, which i'm not sure of.  otherwise, no, adding files has to be done by the user
[08:21:41] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File
[08:40:13] <BrazenBraden> sometimes JS and I are friends, other times, moral enemies lol. Why am I getting an error that _checkTownInputData is not a function when calling it from submitTowns()?  http://hastebin.com/kuyaqifanu.js
[08:41:22] <taplar> 'this' most likely refers to the submitTowns function
[08:42:43] <taplar> you might try Component.Google.Distance._checkTownInputData() but i'm not familiar with the new Class() construct
[08:43:39] <BrazenBraden> 'this' definitely refers to the class. I call other functions in other places without any issue
[08:44:19] <firevulpes> Forgot to say, thanks taplar
[08:44:32] <taplar> np
[08:44:42] <taplar> BrazenBraden: not sure then.
[08:49:56] <Cork> BrazenBraden: you need to pass the context to $.proxy
[08:50:12] <Cork> BrazenBraden: currently you don't set a this at all
[08:50:21] <Koopz> $(':data(uid)') should return all elements that have a data-uid attribute, right?
[08:50:29] <Cork> Koopz: right
[08:50:34] <Koopz> weird
[08:51:06] <Cork> BrazenBraden: so change this.element.find('.submit').on('click', $.proxy(this.submitTowns)) to this.element.find('.submit').on('click', $.proxy(this.submitTowns, this))
[08:51:23] <BrazenBraden> Cork, ahh I see!
[08:52:04] <BrazenBraden> Cork, quite right! All other proxy methods pass this along but I forgot it here.
[08:57:30] <Koopz> got a table in my current browser tab
[08:57:40] <Koopz> $('tr') returns length 2
[08:57:56] <Koopz> one of the trs has a data-uid attribute
[08:58:08] <Cork> Koopz: make a jsfiddle
[08:58:09] <Koopz> $(':data(uid)') returns length 0
[08:58:25] <Cork> :data searches the data cache, not attributes
[08:59:01] <taplar> $('tr').filter(function(){ return this.dataset.uid; })
[08:59:42] <Koopz> which means that the data attribute must be there at the moment when HTML is returned from the server
[08:59:59] <Cork> Koopz: again, :data searches the cache, not attributes
[09:00:41] <Koopz> and when is that cache being generated?
[09:00:54] <Cork> when you call .data()
[09:01:09] <Koopz> i don't set data via jquery
[09:01:19] <Cork> then you can't use :data
[09:01:33] <Cork> use $('[data-uid]')
[09:02:15] <Koopz> aye that does the trick
[09:02:35] <Koopz> thanks, m8
[09:02:51] <Cork> basically :data is there so you can search for data jquery holds
[09:02:58] <Cork> as you can't use css selectors for that normally
[09:03:17] <Cork> while data-<key> is just normal attributes so you can query them just fine
[09:03:49] <Koopz> i'll keep that in mind ;)
[09:07:11] <skywater> hi how to test jquery-1.11.3 on jsfiddle can i use 1.9 then ?
[09:08:14] <taplar> if fiddle doesn't have the version you want you could include it from a cdn
[09:08:37] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
[09:14:32] <_TWG_> I'm trying to add/remove a class to a div based on the height and scroll point.  Can anyone help me figure out what I've done wrong?
[09:14:33] <_TWG_> http://kopy.io/4W3iQ#oOJgEbiJTTU7Fa
[09:15:25] <taplar> scrollTop is a method i believe
[09:16:02] <shoky> also you might want a scroll event handler ;p
[09:16:28] <_TWG_> taplar you were correct.  I forgot to add the ().
[09:16:38] <_TWG_> shoky can you explain some more.
[09:17:00] <_TWG_> Teaching myself javascript right now.  The individual that use to write it for me is no longer working with me.
[09:17:07] <shoky> _TWG_: your code will currently run once on page load, and never run again. the scrollTop will only be checked on page load and never again ;p
[09:17:07] <taplar> your logic is only going to run on page load.  you don't have it inside a scroll event handler
[09:17:37] <shoky> event handlers let you run code when some event happens, e.g. scroll
[09:17:56] <_TWG_> Okay, so do I need to create a function and move that code into it and then call that function inside my event handler?
[09:17:59] <taplar> i've seen you in here before _TWG_ so i figured you were not so new to this.  is this not so?
[09:18:17] <shoky> the function itself could be the event handler. you need to listen for the scroll event though
[09:18:35] <shoky> e.g. with .on() method
[09:18:56] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/
[09:19:02] <_TWG_> I've been in here but before but I still haven't learned much yet.  Every time I start to make good progress on a project I get pulled to something else and by the time I get back to it, I don't remember a lot of the stuff taplar.
[09:19:02] <taplar> along with other good articles
[09:19:19] <shoky> then go learn ;]
[09:19:29] <taplar> ah, it's cool.  just wanted to ask so I could respond appropriately
[09:20:02] <_TWG_> I try to when I have time shoky, but I'm the only developer for a university so my time is very limited with the number of projects they bring to me.
[09:20:05] <_TWG_> shoky
[09:21:05] <shoky> that's fine _TWG_ but don't expect people here to just teach you how to do something when you haven't even read a basic tutorial or docs
[09:21:19] <_TWG_> taplar: does my scroll listener go on $(window).
[09:21:29] <shoky> cause that's just a waste of everybody's time
[09:21:38] <_TWG_> My bad shoky.  I will go read the entire interwebs before I ever ask another question.
[09:21:47] <shoky> ugh
[09:21:57] <taplar> yah, in this case it'd go on window
[09:22:18] <taplar> it goes on whatever is scrolling
[09:23:31] <_TWG_> Thanks taplar
[09:23:32] <taplar> _TWG_: shoky just wants to teach you to fish, not give you a fish, ;)
[09:23:54] <shoky> and i don't want to explain stuff that's already explained better in the docs/tutorial
[09:23:58] <shoky>  <_TWG_> shoky can you explain some more.
[09:24:11] <shoky> waste of everybody's time, as i said
[09:24:18] <shoky> but go on be obnoxious.
[09:25:14] <_TWG_> I wasn't expecting the docs to be explained to me.  Typically people that have more experience can help me word what I'm searching for better, especially when it's not their strong point.
[09:25:33] <shoky> and we did, and pointed you to the specific tutorial
[09:25:53] <_TWG_> And you didn't have to write a bit of code since I'm writing it.
[09:26:10] <_TWG_> Which this has caused more nonsense conversation than it was worth.
[09:26:35] <shoky> all i said was you should learn :)
[09:28:56] <taplar> one thing that should be noted, that hopefully is mentioned in that tutorial some where, is with a scroll event handler it is especially helpful to do your lookups outside of the handler.
[09:29:09] <taplar> scroll events happen a lot, so you want to hit the dom very little
[09:33:14] <skinux> Is jQuery really bloated or is that just something people say?
[09:33:27] <taplar> depends on how much of it you use
[09:33:35] <skinux> I just want the AJAX
[09:33:53] <skinux> And the ability to show/hide divs, and to make modals happen
[09:34:02] <taplar> lol
[09:34:12] <skinux> ?
[09:34:12] <shoky> hehe
[09:34:12] <firevulpes> Has anyone here ever worked with pdfMake? ~
[09:34:17] <taplar> so ajax, selectors, and ui?
[09:34:21] <_TWG_> taplar got it all working now.
[09:34:24] <skinux> Yeah, I guess so.
[09:34:27] <shoky> no, jquery is not bloated
[09:34:29] <_TWG_> Just got to put in some logic for the page width.
[09:34:38] <taplar> _TWG_: cool
[09:36:18] <taplar> some people say jquery is bloated because more and more of the logic it can do is being incorporated into vanilla
[09:36:43] <taplar> which is good, but your still going to have compatibility issues for a while, and older brower support
[09:36:48] <Cork> taplar: and more and more features are getting simplified in jquery
[09:36:54] <Cork> so that statement is kinda moot
[09:37:03] <taplar> true
[09:37:36] <Cork> heck $.find used to be a mess cause it had to support querySelectorAll() and all[]
[09:38:51] <Cork> on the other hand though, for simpler code snippets you don't need jquery now days
[09:39:04] <Cork> but it's more cause you don't need any lib at all
[09:41:00] <_TWG_> Okay.  I've got it all working except for page resize.   I'm trying to figure out in my code where to execute the $(window).resize logically.
[09:41:25] <Cork> _TWG_: you don't execute window resize, you bind it
[09:41:44] <_TWG_> Okay.
[09:41:48] <Cork> and as window is always around you can do that basically anywhere
[09:51:39] <_TWG_> Okay.  For some reason it's not removing the 'navbar-fixed-top' if I'm scrolled all the way to the top and I resize the window to bigger than 767px wide
[09:51:41] <_TWG_> http://kopy.io/A2E5P#673thBQp0vmQpr
[09:53:15] <shoky> .width is a function
[09:53:34] <skywater> hi anyone knows why this code doesnt work?
[09:53:35] <skywater> https://jsfiddle.net/9s9vuwL2/1/
[09:53:53] <shoky> also notice you're doing an addClass or removeClass on EVERY scroll event, even if there is no need to do anything
[09:54:22] <shoky> every scroll event AND every resize event
[09:54:26] <_TWG_> shoky is that not correct to do?
[09:54:54] <shoky> _TWG_  if you have just added the class on scroll, and the user continues to scroll in the same direction, there's no need to add the class again, right?
[09:55:20] <_TWG_> Well yeah.  I didn't think it would add again after it added the first time
[09:55:22] <taplar> skywater: check your console.  there is an error
[09:55:51] <shoky> _TWG_: it would do what your code tells it to do :P   but this isn't THAT much of an issue indeed because addClass for a class that already exists doesnt do anything,
[09:56:03] <shoky> but it still needs to check if the class is there etc.
[09:57:46] <taplar> _TWG_: also you do not have to duplicate your binding like that.  you can do on('scroll resize, function(){...
[09:57:53] <skywater> taplar, i try to add my own framework attribute
[09:57:58] <taplar> on('scroll resize'
[09:58:27] <taplar> skywater: huh?
[09:58:38] <skywater> because i use
[09:58:40] <skywater> jquery 1.11.3
[09:58:55] <skywater> i add https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.4/jquery-ui.min.js to Framework <Script> Attribute on jsfiddle
[09:59:03] <taplar> i'm saying your fiddle is broken.  look at your console and figure out what the issue is and address it
[10:00:11] <_TWG_> shoky I changed my code but now on anything larger than 767 it keeps the class added.  http://kopy.io/Gc7ph#7poCWxJPvyetVJ
[10:01:03] <shoky> _TWG_: mm your first if  makes it not do anything if the class is already there.. so it never removes the class yep
[10:01:13] <shoky> _TWG_: you should use a boolean flag instead of that if
[10:02:52] <_TWG_> shoky, thanks.  Looking at how to implement that right now
[10:03:28] <_TWG_> Well crap, gotta head to a meeting.  Will try to finish looking it up in a hour.
[10:09:18] <shoky> _TWG_: http://kopy.io/fj3At  maybe
[10:10:28] <shoky> tho for the resize it's usually done with media queries
[10:19:23] <engaged> How come no alert is popping on this:   <div id=“c1”> <div id=“freq1”>Freq1</div> <div id=“freq2”>Freq 2</div> </div>      $(“#c1”).on(‘click’,function() { alert(“hi”); })
[10:21:55] <shoky> engaged: works ok, assuming those fancy quotes aren't in your original code..  https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/2/
[10:23:01] <engaged> for some reason not working on my site, crap
[10:23:33] <shoky> post your whole code if you want
[10:23:44] <engaged> funny story
[10:23:47] <engaged> spelled it wrong :)
[10:23:54] <shoky> ;p
[10:41:09] <Duikb00t> Has someone an idea how I can add indexes to my serial_no[] and addres[] ?
[10:41:36] <Duikb00t> So it results in : serial_no[0][]     address[0][]
[10:41:40] <Duikb00t> totally stuck
[10:44:51] <sillyslux> you mean arrays in arrays?! serial_no=[]; serial_no.push([]); would create something like serial_no[0][]
[10:47:23] <Duikb00t> sillyslux:  line 13 and 14 https://jsfiddle.net/duikboot/2ec0gdLs/27/
[10:47:34] <Duikb00t> But Im not sure how to add that based on the clone
[10:47:44] <Duikb00t> indeed what you ay is what I need serial_no[0][]
[10:48:31] <PCatinean> hey guys, can I do a shorthand for this? .on('blur',function if x == y otherwise nothing?)
[10:48:57] <shoky> shorthand for .. what?
[10:59:04] <sillyslux> afaik, you can't put arrays into an html element's attributes, they take strings only
[11:03:14] <sillyslux> what would you even need serial_no[0][] for? Duikb00t
[11:04:27] <firevulpes> AJAX question: $.post('[url]', { param1: var1, param2: var2}); What's the equivalent of this using $.ajax ?
[11:07:00] <sillyslux> firevulpes, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ scroll down to near the end, first of the Examples
[11:12:15] <codecutter> I have a list (.foo) which has multiple li's with h2 <ul class="foo"><li><h2>bar</h2></li></ul>, trying to compare a string with the text of h2 element and return it's parent li
[11:17:16] <firevulpes> sillyslux: <333
[11:18:25] <sillyslux> codecutter, try this in your console $('<ul class="foo"><li><h2>bar</h2></li><li><h2>rab</h2></li></ul>').find('li').filter((i,el)=>$(el).find('h2').text()=='rab')
[11:25:05] <Simbaclaws> hey all, I'm wondering how I could pass a jquery object with jquery functions as parameter to another function and then execute it from within that function?
[11:25:46] <Simbaclaws> myfunction($('.example').click());
[11:25:51] <Simbaclaws> for example
[11:26:12] <Simbaclaws> and in myfunction: function myfunction(execute) { execute(); }
[11:26:17] <Simbaclaws> that doesn't seem to work
[11:27:38] <Simbaclaws> I've also tried putting a function in a variable with the jquery object and functions in it and passing that but to no avail.
[11:33:52] <sillyslux> Simbaclaws, $('.example').click() returns an jQuery object, objects are not executable, functions are
[11:34:14] <sillyslux> what are you trying to do?
[11:34:42] <Simbaclaws> I'm trying to execute it from somewhere else
[11:35:01] <sillyslux> you want to execute what?
[11:35:19] <Simbaclaws> so for example let's say I have 2 functions calling the same functions, that function should call 2 seperate jquery objects with jquery function calls
[11:36:05] <Simbaclaws> basically I have a function that needs to be called from 2 different functions and whenever it is either one of the two it should execute different jquery functions
[11:36:12] <Simbaclaws> I could probably use a string or something...
[11:36:16] <Simbaclaws> now that I'm thinking about it
[11:36:28] <Simbaclaws> or boolean or number or whatever
[11:36:31] <Simbaclaws> just put an if in there :P
[11:36:37] * sillyslux is confused
[11:36:47] <Simbaclaws> nevermind I think I know what to do
[11:36:48] <Simbaclaws> thanks ;)
[11:36:52] <sillyslux> :)
[11:37:07] <Simbaclaws> I was confusing myself and making it harder for myself
[11:37:14] <Simbaclaws> I sometimes do that by accident
[11:37:28] <sillyslux> maybe $('.example').click(function(){myfunction($(this))})
[11:37:50] <Simbaclaws> oooh! that could work
[11:38:16] <Simbaclaws> this would pass the jquery object which I can then .click() again right :D?
[11:38:17] <sillyslux> that will execute myfunction and give it an jquery object of this element
[11:38:28] <Simbaclaws> yeah got it, thanks man
[11:38:32] <Simbaclaws> you're a lifesaver
[11:38:47] <sillyslux> glad i could help :P
[11:38:55] <_TWG_> Still online Shoky?
[11:40:43] <Simbaclaws> oh wait if you pass a function to click() it will not execute the click but wait for you to click on it right?
[11:40:49] <Simbaclaws> I need to instead execute the click...
[11:40:55] <shoky> _TWG_ ya
[11:41:00] <Simbaclaws> it will act as an event then
[11:41:12] <_TWG_> I saw you sent a link but when I clicked on it, it was blank. shoky
[11:41:21] <shoky> hm
[11:41:25] <sillyslux> ah you mean triggerevent
[11:41:25] <mistermocha> hey all... I'm trying to respond to a stylistic review request. I have a statement like this  $('#foo').children('.foo-kids').each( function() { ... do_things_to(this) } )
[11:41:30] <Simbaclaws> yeah
[11:41:34] <mistermocha> but I've been asked to get away from using 'this'
[11:41:41] <Simbaclaws> it will trigger the event when you don't pass a function
[11:41:57] <Simbaclaws> oops I mean the other way around
[11:42:10] <mistermocha> I had hoped to use something like $('#foo').children('.foo-kids').each( function(fooKids) { do_things_to(fooKids) } )
[11:42:13] <Simbaclaws> it will trigger the event when you don't pass a function, and it doesn't trigger it when you do
[11:42:16] <mistermocha> but that doesn't seem to work
[11:42:35] <shoky> _TWG_:  meh what is this stupid pastebin :\
[11:42:43] <sillyslux> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[11:42:54] <mistermocha> given my first statement, how would you drop 'this' from the internal anonymous function?
[11:43:04] <Simbaclaws> thanks I'll check it out
[11:43:08] <_TWG_> You talking about kopy.io?
[11:43:28] <codecutter> need to find the text of line 13 http://pastebin.com/njffGx9M
[11:43:41] <codecutter> there maybe multiple of li's
[11:43:43] <shoky> _TWG_ ya i can't even see any of your pastes now
[11:43:55] <Simbaclaws> so I just use $('.example').trigger("click"); at the end of the code then :)
[11:44:12] <alexlica21boy59> hi all... What does this mean - $("<div></div>)?
[11:44:54] <_TWG_> They expire after so long depending what it's set at.
[11:45:18] <codecutter> anyone?
[11:46:28] <shoky> _TWG_: guess yours was set low and mine used the same setting.. sec
[11:46:46] <sillyslux> codecutter, of course you can traverse, but honestly, why don't you just give it a class and go by that?
[11:46:56] <_TWG_> Yeah, evidently it was set for an hour.  I thought I had selected 1 day. shoky
[11:47:13] <Simbaclaws> hmm nevermind doesn't work, I'll just use an if with a string, seems way easier
[11:47:53] <shoky> _TWG_  it was something like this.. http://kopy.io/et0W2
[11:49:01] <shoky> that &&  might need to be a ||  dont remember,  not tested anyways
[11:49:03] <alexlica21boy59> Hey all, what is the difference between $("div") and $("<div></div>") ? $("div") return jquery object, but I am not sure about  $("<div></div>") .
[11:49:04] <_TWG_> shoky:  wow, thanks.  You were able to get the code even shorter.  Thanks
[11:49:09] <shoky> np
[11:51:40] <shoky> alexlica21boy59:  $("div")  finds all <div> elements in the DOM.  $("<div>")  creates a new <div> element.  they both return a jquery object
[11:52:34] <shoky> and $("<div></div>") is the same as $("<div>")
[11:52:53] <alexlica21boy59> shoky, thanks.
[11:54:22] <shoky> mistermocha:  read the docs for .each(),  the current element is the 2nd argument to the callback
[11:54:22] <_TWG_> shoky that worked perfectly
[11:54:32] <shoky> _TWG_ awesome ;]
[11:54:46] <mistermocha> shoky: that's it ... thanks
[11:55:01] <_TWG_> Not I'm docing it and I will use it to learn.  Plus I'm going to start reading up on the docs.
[11:55:05] <mistermocha> the param there doesn't behave the same as 'this' though ...
[11:55:50] <shoky> how so?
[11:56:12] <mistermocha> nevermind, I was wrong, it behaves exactly like it should
[11:56:31] <PCatinean> on('blur',function(){ if statement: run function } I knw there's a difference between passing the function as callback and running it inside the body like that
[11:56:35] <shoky> btw it's a weird request, to ask you to use jquery not in the idiomatic way that jquery is used by pretty much everyone ;)
[11:58:48] <shoky> PCatinean: the function that you pass to .on() is the event handler. it is the function that receives the event argument and has `this` set to the element you added the handler to. if you call another function from inside it, that other function is not an event handler - it doesn't receive arguments or `this` automatically, just a regular function call
[11:59:46] <codecutter> is there a more elegant way to write this?  console.log($(value).parent().parent());
[11:59:59] <robertmaxrees> codecutter sure - use .closest() and select the ancestor itself.
[12:19:58] <PCatinean> shoky, so how can I call it inside with the effect of calling itas you said before?
[12:20:44] <PCatinean> I mean, call it on the element so $(this) represents the element where the event is triggered
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean you mean in the other function you're calling?
[12:21:20] <shoky> PCatinean you can pass arguments to the function,  or if you really want to set `this` you can use  function.call(this)
[12:23:48] <PCatinean> The thing is I have a even on a element that triggers the event handler and does stuff, then on the other side I have another event bound on some other element that should only trigger if the original value is changed
[12:24:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:24:15] <robertmaxrees> so then you need to manage state somewhere.
[12:24:18] <PCatinean> In order to record if the original data is changed I bind focus event on the element and on blur I check if the value is the same, if it is then use the same function
[12:24:37] <yahkob> I just noticed if you try to append a node to the DOM that is referenced somewhere it wont append it a second time. Maybe it replaces?
[12:24:41] <PCatinean> so originally it was on('blur', callback) now it has to be on blur if initial value is changed callback
[12:24:45] <yahkob> I can't find anywhere that documents this on jQuery's docs
[12:24:55] <yahkob> heres an example: $('<div/>', {class: 'foobar'}).text('baz')
[12:25:04] <yahkob> woops hah, https://jsbin.com/hogupujace/edit?html,js,output **
[12:26:04] <robertmaxrees> yahkob http://api.jquery.com/append/
[12:26:10] <robertmaxrees> "If an element selected this way is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be moved into the target (not cloned):"
[12:26:19] <yahkob> damnit!
[12:26:31] <yahkob> I was looking to hard i suppose robertmaxrees :)
[12:26:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:28:27] <taplar> PCatinean: you have events triggering other events?
[12:28:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar it sounds more like they're confused about how events work :)
[12:30:22] <taplar> fun times
[12:30:51] <Kricir> can someone help me out, I am having some issues firing bootstrap tab in my script https://gist.github.com/kricir/2c27984a02fc738f4232f7cf2c3f9ae0

[12:32:47] <Kricir> sorry try this one http://pastie.org/10905189
[12:33:15] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[12:34:16] <Kricir> I can alert the value in the if statement just fine, but the $('#general').tab('show') doesn't work, ideally I want to change #general to value
[12:34:56] <Kricir> my div doesn't show as it should, doesn't add class active, no fade, no transition
[12:35:19] <Kricir> here is the actual page to see it, http://ncm.web50.iwmstage.com/contact
[12:35:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p07171dp/
[12:35:34] <robertmaxrees> here's a fiddle for it.
[12:36:41] <robertmaxrees> something seems off.  you sure your tab markup is correct?
[12:36:54] <taplar> ^ bs looks like it needs nav-tabs class
[12:37:02] <taplar> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html#navs
[12:37:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:38:44] <Kricir> so I can't just initiate from the select, I need to include the tabs and have them fire the event... I'll give that a shot
[12:38:52] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[12:39:06] <taplar> convention over configuration, :)
[12:39:23] <taplar> probably a manual way to do it, but why?
[12:39:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ there's a really easy way to do this without bootstrap.
[12:39:57] <flashpoint9> Hey gang, I am trying to loop over an array of jquery objects but I believe Im not building the array correctly. Here's my code: https://gist.github.com/JosephLeon/d167c524dc89293010a4a8fb502f6743
[12:40:07] <robertmaxrees> 404.
[12:40:12] <robertmaxrees> github is having issues right now flashpoint9
[12:40:17] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle or something else?
[12:40:22] <flashpoint9> Yea hold on
[12:41:08] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: http://paste.ofcode.org/ZwH2wLWDCL3yHyNGFEL26c
[12:41:17] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:41:28] <robertmaxrees> so first off, why not just make a single jquery object instead?
[12:41:31] <taplar> heh, take a gander at each() dude
[12:41:47] <robertmaxrees> $('.view-commerce-cart-form tablem, .ui-widget-content table')
[12:41:48] <taplar> wait, he is
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> then just .each() through that.
[12:41:56] <flashpoint9> I was trying to level up on js skill, why i avoided jquery each function
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> instead of making an array of jquery objects.
[12:42:05] <AcidRain> hello, how can i find the last <div class='something'> in a form
[12:42:11] <AcidRain> im not sure im doing it right
[12:42:13] <taplar> $('.something')
[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> $('form .something') acidjazz
[12:42:16] <taplar> if it is a class
[12:42:35] <AcidRain> hmmmm
[12:42:38] <taplar> flashpoint9: using a for loop isn't really leveling up
[12:42:39] <flashpoint9> I did originally try $('.view-commerce-cart-form tablem, .ui-widget-content table') but it still didn't work, should I try it again
[12:42:45] <taplar> each() and forEach() are your friends
[12:42:51] <AcidRain> the form is not a class
[12:43:05] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 something tells me your markup isn't what you think it is :)
[12:43:07] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :D
[12:43:17] <AcidRain> form = $("form[name='questions']"); lastdiv = form.last(".something");
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain that's fine?  $('form .something') will work there.
[12:43:44] <taplar> "tables_length[i]" <- that is an error  tables_length is a Number
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> unless you have multiple forms to worry about.
[12:44:12] <AcidRain> er.... so that part is right both ways then?
[12:44:14] <AcidRain> right?
[12:44:20] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain what part?
[12:44:30] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: http://paste.ofcode.org/pt8RquPkVhkRMuEFVemzja
[12:44:32] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, both what i posted and what you posted
[12:44:41] <flashpoint9> That has the working code below the broken code
[12:44:50] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 make a functioning fiddle instead?
[12:44:52] <flashpoint9> I was trying to not repeat myself
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain you can select via attributes, but I'd avoid it if possible.
[12:45:14] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: ok so just go and do it in fiddle?
[12:45:18] <taplar> flashpoint9: either extract that function into a named function and reuse it, or combine what your loopin gover
[12:45:26] <AcidRain> ok, robertmaxrees so what about this now: last_number = lastdiv.find("input[type='text']").data('order');
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 and i already showed you how to combine those two collections.
[12:45:53] <AcidRain> it finds the 1st 1, and it finds the 2nd one. but everything after that it only finds the 2nd 1. which to me means it never found anything to begin with
[12:45:56] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain that's maybe a bit better, but I avoid attribute selectors.
[12:46:00] <robertmaxrees> like, as a rule.
[12:46:18] <AcidRain> well. its required
[12:46:26] <AcidRain> im doing some complex things
[12:46:29] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: thanks ill try some more
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 you can just do var $tables = $('.ui-widget-content table, .view-commerce-cart-form table');
[12:46:39] <robertmaxrees> and then use that .each()
[12:46:39] <flashpoint9> taplar: thanks for the suggestions, will take a stab at it
[12:46:47] <robertmaxrees> AcidRain then add calsses?
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> *classes
[12:47:25] <robertmaxrees> if you can't do that, then  lastdiv.find("input[type='text']").data('order'); will work but it'll only return the data-order value for the first input.
[12:47:45] <AcidRain> thats all i need it to do. but its not doing that
[12:47:58] <AcidRain> ill try to mark up a fiddle
[12:48:01] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[12:51:24] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/2dn7gh1m/
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[12:52:30] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, create 5 things. notice that after 2, its always 2
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?  i'm able to create things infinitely.
[12:53:41] <AcidRain> look at the alert box. it always says 2 after 2
[12:53:42] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the "next_order"
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:53:52] <AcidRain> yes sir. thank you
[12:53:55] <robertmaxrees> this is an easy one :)
[12:54:19] <robertmaxrees> variable scope.
[12:56:28] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, im not getting the variable scope reference
[12:56:32] <taplar> i think it's a misuse of last()
[12:56:39] <taplar> ln 4
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> mmm, that too.
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/last/
[12:57:05] <robertmaxrees> last doesn't take any args.
[12:57:24] <robertmaxrees> lastdiv = form.find('.question').last(),
[12:57:26] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[12:57:31] <AcidRain> ah
[12:57:33] <robertmaxrees> and scope those vars down.
[12:58:30] <AcidRain> got 'er working. thx for the help guys
[12:58:33] <taplar> i'm not entirely sure why your doing that though
[12:58:43] <taplar> you could keep a variable with the order and not look anything up...
[12:58:45] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the data-order attribute?
[12:59:21] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, because these questions will be in a certain order once they are done
[12:59:34] <AcidRain> im going to make it so they can be moved up and down. and thats how they will be inserted into the db
[12:59:51] <taplar> but what does that have to do with the max order?
[13:00:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.  you could just grab the .index() of each element to get those values.
[13:00:06] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[13:00:25] <taplar> and if they are not in order, getting the last one to find the order is going to be broken anyway
[13:01:50] <AcidRain> robertmaxrees, thats a good idea too
[13:01:52] <AcidRain> lol
[13:02:02] <robertmaxrees> easier to handle since then you don't have to update all the data attributes.
[13:02:12] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to grab the index when managing all of that anyway.
[13:02:24] <AcidRain> yeah point point
[13:03:18] <AcidRain> quick question tho. once i get to the point where im adding answers... i cant submit this form and know which questions go to which answers or what order they are actually in.
[13:03:20] <AcidRain> any suggestions?
[13:03:34] <AcidRain> or am i giong to have to create my own post function to do it'
[13:03:38] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:03:46] <AcidRain> ah. ok. thats what i figured.
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> wait are you using ajax ooor...?
[13:03:48] <AcidRain> thx guys!
[13:04:12] <AcidRain> no ajax.
[13:04:19] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:04:33] <taplar> you'd want the name to some how relate them then
[13:04:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:04:49] <taplar> question5 goes with answer5
[13:04:49] <robertmaxrees> does the type of input matter at all?
[13:05:01] <robertmaxrees> like, lots of stuff to consider at that point.
[13:15:54] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: Got it working with this http://paste.ofcode.org/377N7JWvjKuHSE99FiKLxd8
[13:16:18] <flashpoint9> Thanks
[13:16:22] <robertmaxrees> awesome, though i'm curious...
[13:16:40] <robertmaxrees> ah, looks like your shuffling data between tds and ths.
[13:17:32] <taplar> row could be passed in on the outer each, and the count is really the inner each index +1
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:18:40] <taplar> personally i wonder if it would be more efficient to loop over the th instead and apply them to the tds
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> or would it be more efficient to do this in the backend?
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:19:12] <taplar> :D
[13:20:38] <taplar> crazy talk
[13:23:45] <taplar> would eq() be better than nth-of-type?
[13:24:02] <robertmaxrees> in general, methods are better than selectors.
[13:54:24] <PCatinean> sorry was away
[13:54:52] <PCatinean> So I have the blur event which has a callback defined, the callback is supposed to check the original value and if it's different should call another method that sends ajax data and so on
[13:55:05] <PCatinean> the reason I have the ajax stuff in a separate function is because other events trigger this as well
[13:55:05] <robertmaxrees> you want the change event then.
[13:55:16] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, only if the original value is changed and the blurred
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> right, sounds like you want two different handlers.
[13:55:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you need to maintain state somewhere about whether or not the value changed.
[13:56:41] <PCatinean> here's a short paste: http://hastebin.com/pocozinuha.coffee
[13:57:20] <robertmaxrees> so what does onchange actually do?
[13:57:46] <PCatinean> gather information from the form, serialize it, add remove classes depending on several conditions, sends ajax data to the server and so on
[13:57:56] <PCatinean> the point is, the functionality is the same, triggers are different
[13:58:02] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:58:08] <PCatinean> bad design?
[13:58:16] <robertmaxrees> confusing explanation.
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> are you doing something additional when the input has change?
[13:58:33] <robertmaxrees> *changed
[13:58:57] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/picacizusi.coffee
[13:59:28] <robertmaxrees> ....
[13:59:41] <robertmaxrees> right, so earlier you were talking about whether or not the value had changed.
[13:59:52] <PCatinean> yes
[13:59:53] <robertmaxrees> all of this code is about the current status of things.
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> also - you want .prop(), not .attr().  and use === instead of ==.  just as an aside.
[14:00:53] <PCatinean> The onchange function is a function I made for the purpose of encoding the form and sending the current state to the server. This function should be called on separate events: 1. when a select tag from the form is changes or 2. when a input field with free text is changed
[14:01:26] <PCatinean> I cannot set the same event for both "change" and select both elements since it will trigger every time somebody adds or removes a char from the input field
[14:01:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not how change works.
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> change first after the input loses focus.
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> and only fires if the value actually changed.
[14:02:04] <PCatinean> ok, let me check
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> input behaves the way you're desribing.
[14:03:15] <PCatinean> wtf...change does the exact same thing I want
[14:03:24] <PCatinean> But I was here and asked for advice and they said it's the only way I can do it
[14:03:27] <robertmaxrees> like i tried to tell you multiple times.
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:03:51] <robertmaxrees> what did "they" say?
[14:03:58] <PCatinean> Damn I was hellbent on the fact it did not work like this due to the fact that I've been advised so
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that there was a miscommunication.
[14:04:21] <PCatinean> I'll have to go back to the logs but since it was a very experienced user acive here most probably I made a error in reading
[14:04:27] <PCatinean> damn...
[14:04:31] <taplar> o_O
[14:04:35] <PCatinean> now it's just config_form.on('change', '.cfg_input, .custom_val:not([type="file"])', onchange);
[14:04:39] <PCatinean> and all is fine
[14:04:55] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:05:09] <PCatinean> still something confusing? :))
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> there's a really good chance that you may not have explained something properly or they didn't understand what you were looking for.
[14:05:13] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty common.
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> also, .custom_val:not([type="file"]) - don't do thgis.
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead.
[14:05:33] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors are gross :)
[14:06:18] <PCatinean> haha, so I've been told, the problem is that being a dynamic application anyone can alter the form and if they omit the class it all goes bad :))
[14:06:31] <robertmaxrees> then you don't let them remove certain classes.
[14:06:33] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[14:08:29] <PCatinean> they can literally replace the entire form
[14:08:39] <robertmaxrees> what are you building, exactly?
[14:13:29] <PCatinean> A web application that generates a form based on entries in a database in a modular way that can be modified
[14:13:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a little too much control imo.
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:14:08] <PCatinean> you mean flexibility offered?
[14:14:41] <robertmaxrees> i mean control.  you can offer that flexibility without giving them the ability to kill your classes.
[14:14:48] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) but just an idea.
[14:17:10] <dlam> is there a way to select elements that have an arbitrary attribute?  like   <div davids-special-div class="foo-bar"></div>       ...I want to select "all div's with davids-special-div in em"
[14:17:32] <robertmaxrees> dlam should be able to, but i'd be careful with custom attributes.
[14:18:19] <PCatinean> I get your point
[14:19:13] <dlam> hmm  $('[davids-special-div=""]')  no work  xD
[14:19:33] <robertmaxrees> because that's looking for divs where that attribute is set to an empty string.
[14:20:58] <robertmaxrees> custom attribute names are a pain, fwiw.
[14:21:05] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't use data attributes instead?
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> MUCH easier to work with.
[14:21:38] <dlam> nope i can use a data-whatever thing
[14:21:43] <robertmaxrees> then use those.
[14:22:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4a6p5jbe/
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, give 'em a class.
[14:26:53] <jose3_> I just finished a little project, would anyone mind looking at it and pointing out any glaring issues. As is the code runs, just want to make sure it follows better practices
[14:27:06] <robertmaxrees> jose3_ sure.
[14:27:11] <robertmaxrees> toss a link out to the channel.
[14:27:19] <robertmaxrees> if people have time to review, they will.
[14:29:12] <jose3_> Thanks
[14:29:13] <jose3_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ac908e301f1c55c98bff3c62ba5084f1
[14:29:22] <jose3_> damn i always do that
[14:29:33] <jose3_> i didnt mean to embed it here
[14:29:40] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:29:44] <robertmaxrees> embed what where?
[14:30:46] <jose3_> nm, but that is the link to a public gist ^^
[14:30:47] <robertmaxrees> also, first red flags: 22 global vars?  assignment = "<?php echo $assignment ?>", - don't tell me you're generating this via PHP.  errorMessage = $('.event-selection').append("<h3 class='text-center text-danger'>This event has expired.</h3>"), if this is a default, just put it on the page itself.  any reason this isn't in an IIFE?
[14:31:50] <robertmaxrees> (leadCaptured === true) could be changed to just leadcaptured.  no need for the parens or the comparison to true.
[14:32:24] <robertmaxrees> where do you ever set jsonData?  I might look into using a deferred for that so you can attach handlers to it whenever and read it as needed.
[14:33:12] <jose3_> okay im looking at all this
[14:33:27] <jose3_> dont declare thos variables at the top like i am ?
[14:33:29] <robertmaxrees> just some initial thoughts.  also looks like a few of those vars never get used, but you declare them.
[14:33:48] <robertmaxrees> not what i said :) why are you declaring 22 different vars?
[14:33:52] <robertmaxrees> in a global space like that i mean.
[14:34:03] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're trying to hold state.
[14:34:33] <jose3_> how did you know I want using some of those vars?
[14:34:37] <jose3_> just reading through?
[14:34:44] <robertmaxrees> copy/pasting and looking to see.
[14:34:45] <jose3_> or are you using some sort of debiugging tool
[14:35:54] <jose3_> assignment = "<?php echo $assignment ?>", - don't tell me you're generating this via PHP.
[14:36:09] <jose3_> Im doing this because I need to get the data from an API which is written in php
[15:35:53] <acriax> Heya, I'm having trouble with a short script I got from csstricks. It's supposed to make a horizontal bar slide under a horizontal menu to the item you are hovering over
[15:36:02] <acriax> It works fine, except it gets the wrong width at start
[15:37:01] <acriax> It should take the width of the first item (94px) but it sets it to 114px instead. When hovering over the first item, it correctly sizes down to 94 px, then back up to 114 if I stop hovering over it
[15:37:02] <acriax> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3458ba319218d80aa2be7199fe9bfa70
[15:37:15] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle instead?
[15:37:20] <robertmaxrees> so we can play with it?
[15:37:22] <acriax> I tried, but nothing showed up
[15:37:55] <robertmaxrees> and you added jquery to it?
[15:37:59] <acriax> I'm mainly wondering over lines 9-12 and 16-20 if they look correct
[15:38:02] <acriax> yeah
[15:38:07] <acriax> oh to jsfiddle, no
[15:38:12] <acriax> but not even the html showed up
[15:38:33] <acriax> maybe it was because all the styling (position absolutes and what not)
[15:38:36] <robertmaxrees> all the code looks fine here.
[15:39:01] <robertmaxrees> so I'd have to see it break to know what's up.
[15:39:25] <acriax> I'll try fiddle again
[15:39:35] <robertmaxrees> even if it doesn't function, save it and toss a link out.
[15:40:54] <Kadigan> I was wondering: how can I use jQuery to execute something when all images of a class are loaded? Using jQuery 3.0.0
[15:41:11] <robertmaxrees> Kadigan that's a pretty shaky thing to want to do.
[15:41:25] <sillyslux> :D thought so
[15:41:26] <robertmaxrees> mostly because it's really hard to know when all images of a certain class are done loading.
[15:41:32] <Kadigan> I want to disable interaction with the webpage untill all thumbnails are loaded. :/
[15:41:41] <robertmaxrees> how many thumbnails?
[15:41:46] <Kadigan> ... say, 1500+?
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> holy shit.
[15:41:51] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[15:41:59] <robertmaxrees> so that's not gonna work ;)
[15:42:02] <Kadigan> I see.
[15:42:09] <sillyslux> but browser waits for images until it fires window.load though... does it?
[15:42:13] <robertmaxrees> fully optimize them first.  and only load them on an as needed basis.
[15:42:24] <Kadigan> I'm setting their cache correctly, so they're mostly loaded from the cache.
[15:42:25] <sillyslux> or window.ready
[15:42:27] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux sure, you'll still wait forever.
[15:42:31] <Kadigan> They're dynamically generated.
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> and it's winndow load.
[15:42:45] <robertmaxrees> are you only loading the ones in the current viewport, Kadigan?
[15:43:14] <Kadigan> No, but I need to have them preloaded. The intent is to do a quick visual comparison between photographs and registered (existing) photos
[15:43:28] <Kadigan> and people using it will quickly scroll to the range they want.
[15:43:39] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  you can load them as needed when they do that.
[15:43:53] <robertmaxrees> which won't make them wait nearly as long as it'd take for all 1500.
[15:44:06] <Kadigan> Once they're cached, loading up the 1500+ takes about 7s
[15:44:19] <sillyslux> like twitters "loading more tweets"?
[15:44:20] <robertmaxrees> that's a long time.
[15:44:31] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux or just detecting when they've reached the bottom of the page.
[15:44:32] <sillyslux> or google images
[15:44:49] <sillyslux> they also load more on scroll down
[15:44:54] <Kadigan> robertmaxrees: internal-use tool. But okay, I guess I can simply not give a crap.
[15:44:57] <robertmaxrees> but if you're really insistent, the window load event is what you want.
[15:45:09] <Kadigan> The issue is made complex by having lightbox, which as far as I understand, does pre-loading of the big images
[15:45:19] <Kadigan> which is why my window load event won't fire.
[15:45:32] <Kadigan> (until much, much later)
[15:45:32] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:45:35] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[15:45:44] <Kadigan> Yeah, would prefer to actually kill Lightbox prefetch.
[15:45:46] <Kadigan> >.<
[15:45:49] <acriax> robertmaxrees: I got it fixed :D when adding jquery on jsfiddle, i noticed my version (1.11.3) wasn't on there. So I updated jQuery to 3.0.0 here and now the sizing is correct :)
[15:45:51] <Kadigan> (those are NOT cached)
[15:46:04] <sillyslux> with window.load you could display:none a slightly grayish overlay and set body from scroll:hidden to auto
[15:46:05] <robertmaxrees> i'll bee in IE they are hahahhaa
[15:46:16] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux they can't use the window load event.
[15:46:33] <Kadigan> sillyslux, robertmaxrees: I now realize that it's more important for me to disable lightbox prefetch.
[15:46:33] <robertmaxrees> acriax awesome.
[15:46:44] <robertmaxrees> Kadigan which version of lightbox are you using?
[15:46:53] <Kadigan> The latest.
[15:46:58] <robertmaxrees> http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> this one?
[15:47:01] <Kadigan> (downloaded like 30min ago)
[15:47:02] <Kadigan> Yeah.
[15:47:11] <sillyslux> so your not only loading 1,5k thumbs but full images as well?
[15:47:18] <Kadigan> Apparently so.
[15:47:45] <Kadigan> (resized to about 800x600 and 45% compressed, so to speak)
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> i'd bet the "prefect" in lightbox is actually just it writing the overlay to the page.
[15:48:06] <robertmaxrees> *prefetch.  have you tried other plugins yet?
[15:48:09] <Kadigan> So I would need to tell it to append on click, rather than on load.
[15:48:26] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't offer an option for that as far as I can see.
[15:48:28] <Kadigan> robertmaxrees: I'm used to how lightbox feels. Protips?
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> you've got kind of a special case here.  you might need to build your own.
[15:48:58] <robertmaxrees> and preload only the most relevant images on demand.
[15:50:38] <Kadigan> Wait, no... Now I'm checking Chrome's Network tab
[15:50:43] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[15:50:44] <Kadigan> and it seems Lightbox only loads on demand.
[15:50:50] <robertmaxrees> that sounds more accurate.
[15:50:50] <Kadigan> Okay, problem solved.
[15:56:13] <Kadigan> Okay, thanks.
[15:56:22] <Kadigan> Sorry, closed window :D
[15:56:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:56:26] <Kadigan> Anyway, again, thanks.
[15:56:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:56:49] <Kadigan> (it's just that I don't like to shout "kthxbye" and f-off like that :D)
[15:57:02] <Kadigan> Oh,
[15:57:08] <Kadigan> since I'm already here, I might as well ask:
[15:57:23] <Kadigan> how do I get anonymous functions w/ extenrnal parameter retention?
[15:57:37] <robertmaxrees> mind providing an example?
[15:57:40] <robertmaxrees> because that smells.
[15:58:15] <Kadigan> As in, if I want var set=1; for(i=0; i<something.length; i++){ $(i).on("click", function(){ console.log("When I was assigned, set was " + set); }); set++; }
[15:58:50] <robertmaxrees> so that's different from your initial question :)
[15:58:55] <robertmaxrees> and you're running into scope there.
[15:58:57] <Kadigan> I've seen that some jQuery handlers can use eg. on("click", {set: set}, function() ...
[15:59:06] <Kadigan> but not all of them.
[15:59:36] <Kadigan> I know I'm running into scoping issues, but that's beside the point.
[15:59:44] <robertmaxrees> err, that's actually the entire problem >.>
[15:59:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:59:48] <Kadigan> I want to pass and keep a variable to a function at creation, not execution.
[16:00:08] <Kadigan> More of a timing issue, really. :D
[16:00:13] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[16:00:16] <robertmaxrees> it's literally a scope issue.
[16:00:16] <sillyslux> use Array functions
[16:00:21] <sillyslux> instead of a for loop
[16:00:31] <Kadigan> The for loop was an example,
[16:00:38] <Kadigan> it would most likely be assigned in something like .each()
[16:00:49] <robertmaxrees> you have to pass those as args using .bind(), use an iterator method, or don't do it that way at all.
[16:01:04] <sillyslux> something.map(function(i){ $(i).on("click", function(){ console.log("When I was assigned, set was " + set); }); set++; })
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> i would assign those as data attributes.
[16:01:10] <robertmaxrees> don't use map for that.
[16:01:21] <robertmaxrees> map is from transforming one array format to another.
[16:01:51] <sillyslux> array.forEach then
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  but i wouldn't do that either really.
[16:02:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use data attributes.
[16:02:19] <Kadigan> Normally (I'm more of a C programmer) I would just handle it w/ an external function (ie. handle(x)) instead of a handler (ie. x.handle())
[16:02:38] <Kadigan> but since it's now all async and events and all...
[16:02:50] <sillyslux> event delegation?
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> those require a different solution.
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:03:49] <Kadigan> In general, I need to iterate through a number of objects (same class), calculate a specific value for each one and then have them remember that value when clicked on.
[16:03:51] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't solve their problem.
[16:04:05] <robertmaxrees> give those data attributes instead.
[16:04:07] <Kadigan> Without using a lookup table. :D
[16:04:16] <robertmaxrees> no need to use one.  just use data attributes.
[16:04:18] <Kadigan> robertmaxrees: how do I do that?
[16:04:38] <robertmaxrees> $(theElement).data('someName', yourValue);
[16:05:05] <Kadigan> And then $(this).data('someName') to read it out within the function?
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:05:25] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't have to spin off a ton of handlers.
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> you can use a single delegated one.
[16:06:04] <Kadigan> Ah, because I can simply var handler = function(){}; then each on("click", handler)
[16:06:12] <robertmaxrees> or use a single delegated listener.
[16:06:14] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[16:06:35] <Kadigan> Sounds good. In fact, I can see why I wouldn't want to multiply the functions ad infinite.
[16:06:52] <Kadigan> ad infinitum*
[16:07:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  though then i have to ask - when would you actually need to enumerate like that?
[16:07:49] <Kadigan> What's the alternative when I want to write a function that will take an unknowable number of elements and handle each one?
[16:07:53] <Kadigan> (like above)
[16:08:21] <Kadigan> Can I simply $(element).on("click", function)
[16:08:33] <Kadigan> on an array (or whatever it is) from the multiple selector?
[16:08:41] <robertmaxrees> the jquery object, and yes.
[16:08:52] <robertmaxrees> most jquery methods enumerate over the collection for you.
[16:16:46] <Kadigan> Cool.
[16:17:06] <Kadigan> Never relied on any of that, to be honest... I'll have to give it a try. I'm much more used to it not working like that.
[16:17:11] <Kadigan> (and breaking much more often)
[16:17:17] <robertmaxrees> also: never use for loops on jquery objects.
[16:18:02] <sillyslux> some might argue not to use them ever
[16:18:09] <robertmaxrees> ^ that, too :)
[16:18:15] <robertmaxrees> at least, not when enumerating over arrays.
[16:18:38] <robertmaxrees> if you have a legit need to iterate, go ahead,  but 99% of the time, you don't actually need to count.  you need to do something for every index in an array.
[16:19:51] <Kadigan> I'm very not used to having things automagically done to a list of things.
[16:20:06] <robertmaxrees> welcome to jquery :)
[16:20:14] <Kadigan> So what, if I need to get the ID of each one of these objects, can I just var array = get.attr("id")
[16:20:16] <Kadigan> or something?
[16:20:22] <robertmaxrees> not for those actually.
[16:20:32] <robertmaxrees> that's when $.fn.map comes in handy.
[16:21:26] <robertmaxrees> most (all?) getters only return the first one, but will set all of them.
[16:21:58] <Kadigan> That's weird. I mean, if it goes through all objects, the most logical thing would be for it to return the last one, not the first.
[16:22:01] <Kadigan> Weird.
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> not to most web devs ;)
[16:22:24] <robertmaxrees> most of us would expect the "first"
[16:22:28] <Kadigan> Why?
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> edge cases.  i have multiple elements with the same ID on the page.  that's not valid.
[16:22:50] <robertmaxrees> so we act on the first one because what other one to we act on?
[16:23:01] <Kadigan> (ie. I would expect to have the value of the last position returned, since the pointer would be pointing to the last element on the array when return is called)
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> so you can't think of JS at all like C++
[16:23:20] <Kadigan> With that, again, I have a slight issue.
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> get pointers outta yer head for that :)
[16:23:29] <Kadigan> If having multiple identical IDs is invalid,
[16:23:48] <Kadigan> and we follow the principle of superimposing later ones on older ones,
[16:23:56] <Kadigan> again, the latest identified should be returned.
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:24:07] <robertmaxrees> the browser sees the first one and sets it.
[16:24:14] <robertmaxrees> and ignores the rest.
[16:24:23] <robertmaxrees> because it has no way of knowing what you intended.
[16:24:23] <Kadigan> So basically if (exists) continue
[16:24:37] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't think of it that way.
[16:24:42] <robertmaxrees> but sure?
[16:24:47] <Kadigan> (I'm used to simply writing a set[id] = object, and being done w/ it)
[16:25:01] <robertmaxrees> browsers are much more fickle than you'd think.
[16:25:03] <Kadigan> (if there are multiple, let the user deal for not reading the docs)
[16:25:16] <robertmaxrees> except that the specs have changed over the years.
[16:25:45] <Kadigan> I thought that with Microsoft Edge we were mostly done with hairy two-decades-old specs?
[16:25:51] <Kadigan> Or quirks mode, for that matter.
[16:25:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> we're not done with the 20+ years of pages that were written for those old browsers.
[16:26:11] <robertmaxrees> can't go breaking the internet like that.
[16:26:28] <robertmaxrees> also: you assume that just because MS released edge that end users moved to it.
[16:26:31] <Kadigan> Yeah, well. Everything else is being broken like that, why not the Internet.
[16:26:48] <robertmaxrees> because the end user would blame the browser vendor, not the site/.
[16:26:59] <Kadigan> Each time you update your sources tree, there's at least a 20% chance that something will fail on a damn dependency.
[16:27:02] <robertmaxrees> and it's kind of messy to expect every site to update to your whim.
[16:27:27] <Kadigan> Again, bullshit. :D API vendors and platform vendors do that every month.
[16:27:31] <robertmaxrees> not in the web dev world.  browsers have to support multiple versions of CSS, JS, and HTML.
[16:27:35] <robertmaxrees> not bullshit for the web.
[16:27:39] <Kadigan> >.<
[16:27:45] <Kadigan> I just... >.<
[16:27:52] <robertmaxrees> my company doesn't have time to deal with that sort of shit.
[16:27:55] <robertmaxrees> hardly anybody does.
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> far too much at stake.
[16:28:59] <Kadigan> And software dev companies have to eat that bullshit for breakfast. Why. ._.
[16:29:06] <robertmaxrees> different domain.
[16:29:12] <robertmaxrees> we have to deal with that for backend apis.
[16:29:20] <Kadigan> You can either go to your vendor, which will probably laugh at you, or go f... yourself. ;)
[16:29:37] <robertmaxrees> good vendors will version their APIs for you.
[16:29:40] <Kadigan> (mostly, you can just skip to the latter, and then go to your dev team to write a yet another workaround)
[16:30:30] <Kadigan> Anyway, I'll look into all of that we discussed. Food for thought.
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> which browser do, to an extent.
[16:30:54] <robertmaxrees> but pushing a browser update out to all your end users that breaks some bit of backwards-compatibility means you'll be the odd man out, so your browser will be the "broken" one.  users will move to others instead.
[16:31:14] <robertmaxrees> also: lots of orgs control which versions of things their end users can use, which adds another wrinkle to the whole mess.
[16:31:43] <Kadigan> Yeah, well, that actually doesn't help. Chrome has been screaming about disabling the old "popup window" API (whatever it was called) for what,
[16:31:47] <Kadigan> a year? A year and a half?
[16:32:12] <Kadigan> And when they finally did it, many websites took a few days to move away from the method.
[16:32:29] <Kadigan> Some services are still broken. >.<
[16:32:36] <robertmaxrees> you can still spawn popups in chrome last i checked.
[16:33:03] <Kadigan> I know that the old deprecated method doesn't work since like, May or something. Maybe even April.
[16:33:15] <Kadigan> I'm forced to use a system called Sitecore, and our vendor uses 6.6
[16:33:19] <Kadigan> which still uses that.
[16:33:31] <Kadigan> They actually had the balls to tell us that we should be using Internet Explorer for the system.
[16:33:32] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're conflating popups with opening new tabs.
[16:33:38] <Kadigan> No,
[16:33:50] <Kadigan> it's a sort of a popup thingie that pops up on a webpage and can be moved within it.
[16:33:56] <Kadigan> Like a Windows app popup.
[16:34:03] <Kadigan> (only within a browser)
[16:34:14] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're talking about.  i'd have to see it.
[16:34:26] <arc_> so a modal
[16:34:36] <robertmaxrees> was there ever a standard modal api?
[16:34:43] <arc_> oh idk i just got here
[16:35:06] <Kadigan> Modal Dialogs
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean Window.showModalDialog() ?
[16:35:20] <Kadigan> Yeah.
[16:35:36] <Kadigan> So anyway, the dialogs are now "pre-broken" on Sitecore 6.6, and we're being told to use IE.
[16:35:39] <Kadigan> We're on Macs. :)
[16:35:49] <robertmaxrees> sounds like sitecore needs to update.
[16:36:04] <Kadigan> (so now I end up having to launch a VM to do the three steps that need modal dialogs)
[16:36:11] <Kadigan> Well, their Sitecore anyway,
[16:36:16] <Kadigan> since Sitecore is now on what, 7.2?
[16:36:46] <Kadigan> Not counting on it though, since it's a paid system, and the last migration from 6.4 to 6.6 took about 6 months.
[16:36:54] <robertmaxrees> 8.1 it looks like though.
[16:37:00] <Kadigan> Even better.
[16:37:29] <Kadigan> Blah. It's a web platform vendor behaving like a software API vendor :D
[16:37:32] <robertmaxrees> ah that's where i'd heard of these guys.  asp cms.
[16:38:06] <Kadigan> Yeah, the fact that it works on Windows is a bit funny, even though I've always advocated Windows Server as an actual, production environment.
[16:38:30] <Kadigan> (at least, it is as long as you want to use ASP and the rest of that)
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah. if you use .net and buy into the entire ecosystem, it's fantastic.
[16:38:54] <Kadigan> Yeah.
[16:39:04] <robertmaxrees> but you have to use IIS, MSSQL, VS, the whole 9
[16:39:08] <Kadigan> YUP.
[16:39:18] <Kadigan> PHP and MySQL - doable, but a pain in the proverbial behind.
[16:39:29] <Kadigan> Besides, it's mostly suited for different things IMO.
[16:39:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:39:37] <robertmaxrees> different class of software.
[16:39:50] <Kadigan> AD control can be done on Linux, but it's also a PITA.
[16:40:00] <Kadigan> SMB, see above.
[16:40:01] <robertmaxrees> we use AD for out machines here.
[16:40:06] <robertmaxrees> *our
[16:40:18] <arc_> this is off topic, but does anybody know what the point of 'www3.domain.com' subdomain is
[16:40:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:40:39] <Kadigan> Wasn't it ww3?
[16:40:47] <arc_> no
[16:41:00] <robertmaxrees> w3, and not related i don't think.
[16:41:01] <Kadigan> I recall these being used in the wild as content servers with offloading, back when CDNs weren't a thing.
[16:41:10] <arc_> oh
[16:41:22] <Kadigan> As in, www.domain.com, then www2.domain.com and so on
[16:41:35] <arc_> weird that a site like oculus.com would be using it then, if that's what they're actually using it for
[16:41:40] <Kadigan> They tended to represent physical boxen
[16:41:43] <Kadigan> not VPSes though.
[16:42:16] <Kadigan> I don't know. I mean, any.valid.uri.path.can.be.a.domain.com
[16:42:26] <Kadigan> sort of.
[16:42:26] <robertmaxrees> load balancing?
[16:42:38] <Kadigan> Yeah, 's what I meant.
[16:42:55] <robertmaxrees> could be all kinds of reasons.  people do weird stuff all the time.
[16:42:59] <Kadigan> (though I come from the sort of 'other side', so it was load offloading before it was load balancing)
[16:43:50] <Kadigan> Anyway, thanks for the support!
[16:43:52] <Kadigan> (again :D)
[18:25:11] <idioglossia> Hi everyone. Is there a way to get errors in scripts from $.getScript() ?
[18:26:38] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/#handling-errors
[18:26:42] <robertmaxrees> this not give you what you need?
[18:27:28] <phlix> so just curious. if I have a this.each(function and then inside this function I also use a $.get() if trying to use $(this) inside the $.get it is no longer what it was from inside the first function. So if I do something like $this = $(this) before the $.get and I try to use $this inside $.get it seems functions inside my $.get function seem to fail. But if I don't use $this they work.
[18:27:33] <phlix> not sure if that makes any sense at all
[18:28:13] <robertmaxrees> you're wondering why $this works when this doesnt inside the $.get()
[18:28:30] <robertmaxrees> phlix
[18:28:33] <phlix> Yes
[18:28:55] <idioglossia> robertmaxrees: the sourceURL for the exception thrown is jquery.js
[18:29:00] <idioglossia> the line is 612, col 16
[18:29:03] <idioglossia> not my script
[18:29:09] <idioglossia> it's throwing an error for jquery
[18:29:19] <phlix> even if before the $.get I set something like initialOption = $('select.dropdown-menu').children('option:first').addClass("default").clone().wrap('<div>').parent(); and then try to use initialOption inside the $.get it doesn't want to work either. Its like I can't take any element selector from outside into my $.get function
[18:29:20] <robertmaxrees> phlix so the `this` keyword is reserved - it's special and references a context.
[18:29:35] <robertmaxrees> phlix err, you can in that second case.
[18:29:45] <robertmaxrees> mind making a more fleshed out example?
[18:34:14] <phlix> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/rXdEEPkK
[18:35:02] <phlix> so if I try to use the function inside $.get called getOptions(responseText) works fine. But if I try to use initialOptions that I declared from before $.get then it breaks.
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> how does it "break"?
[18:35:44] <phlix> i mean if i try to use the results from initialOptions inside $.get then the results from getOptions fail
[18:36:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:36:07] <phlix> but if i don't use initialOptions inside $.get then it returns properly
[18:36:53] <robertmaxrees> something here really isn't adding up.
[18:37:35] <robertmaxrees> can you show me a case where it's breaking?
[18:37:41] <phlix> yes
[18:37:46] <robertmaxrees> like, what the code looks like?
[18:37:52] <robertmaxrees> i don't need a link to a page or anything quite yet.
[18:41:48] <idioglossia> Neither $.getScript nor try { eval(str); } catch(e) { ... } return useful information about syntax errors encountered in the script I am trying to load
[18:42:19] <robertmaxrees> idioglossia why not just copy the script into an editor and go from there?
[18:42:28] <systemfault> idioglossia: I never had to use getScript but I would try to see if it has a promise-based callback
[18:42:38] <idioglossia> robertmaxrees: because I am doing something exotic, that is why :)
[18:42:38] <robertmaxrees> it does - .fail()
[18:42:47] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[18:42:59] <idioglossia> load an external script from a local file, which was downloaded from a server
[18:43:25] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:43:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:43:30] <robertmaxrees> so you're loading from the local machine?
[18:43:48] <idioglossia> yes.
[18:43:49] <idioglossia> http://pastebin.com/Cxvhez9Q
[18:43:52] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[18:44:19] <idioglossia> here is the code http://pastebin.com/M3y5m9LR
[18:44:24] <idioglossia> Why?
[18:44:25] <robertmaxrees> your browser is stopping you from being able to do that.
[18:44:31] <idioglossia> no it's not
[18:44:44] <robertmaxrees> so you changed your security settings to allow that?
[18:44:49] <idioglossia> I am using cordova.
[18:45:05] <idioglossia> This works for most of my scripts, but if one has a syntax error I cannot track it down
[18:45:08] <idioglossia> one does
[18:45:14] <idioglossia> I am trying to find that error, and there appears to be no way
[18:45:21] <systemfault> Perhaps $.ajax use getScript when  dataType is 'script' </no-clue>
[18:45:42] <idioglossia> well setting dataType to 'text' and then using eval() on the result does not produce anything useful
[18:45:51] <robertmaxrees> so is that second link the one that's erroring?
[18:45:55] <idioglossia> with try/catch
[18:46:03] <idioglossia> that's the code, the first link is the error
[18:46:36] <robertmaxrees> and all those objects and vars are globally defined?
[18:46:43] <idioglossia> no
[18:46:46] <robertmaxrees> because iirc getscript has to load things int he global scope.
[18:47:05] <idioglossia> wat
[18:47:15] <idioglossia> oh
[18:47:17] <idioglossia> yeah that's fine
[18:47:22] <idioglossia> I expect it to load into the global scope
[18:47:34] <robertmaxrees> so make sure all the vars and stuff it accesses are available in the global scope.
[18:47:34] <idioglossia> and it does :)
[18:47:45] <idioglossia> They are.
[18:47:53] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:47:55] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[18:48:22] <idioglossia> no idea how to get syntax errors?
[18:48:49] <robertmaxrees> what's the try/catch you're using?
[18:49:12] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you may need to wrap that code as a string around the text you're fetching and then eval it.
[18:49:55] <idioglossia> ill just use eslint
[18:49:56] <robertmaxrees> since doing like try { eval(someCode) } catch (e) {} is only going to get errors in the eval itself running, not specifics of what happened inside iirc.
[18:50:06] <idioglossia> true
[18:50:20] <robertmaxrees> but the code you shared doesn't show anything blatantly wrong.  just some things that you assume exist.
[18:50:24] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:51:47] <idioglossia> ill try wrapping the code itself in try {}
[18:53:25] <idioglossia> nah that don't work because it has to be in the global scope i think
[18:53:43] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.  cordova is weird as is.
[18:54:02] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) seems strange to need to load files like that.  does it not provide a way to do that?
[20:24:53] <bar2> im a html+jquery newbie. http://laravel.io/bin/Kkx0Y how do I change the value of city_id, (district field) based on a previous selection in the same form (city field)?
[20:26:24] <duch_kazatel> a change event listener that sets that value.
[20:27:07] <bar2> can you point me to a link that i can follow?
[20:27:30] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[20:31:53] <robertmaxrees> bar2 that make sense?
[20:40:16] <bar2> robertmaxrees it should at some point :)
[23:20:52] <ChrisBinge> Hey guys, could anyone walk me through how I can make my "add item" event work for dynamically created items and ONLY to the specific button pressed? here is what I've got: https://jsfiddle.net/yxceajLk/
[23:22:03] <ChrisBinge> right now it only creates items on the first button on the page load. and when the first item button is pressed with multiple sections created, it adds to each section
[23:55:55] <ChrisBinge> silly question, if I have a variable: var parent = $(this).parent(); and then I want to use that in a selector ie. $(parent > '.some-class') what is the correct syntax?
[23:57:42] <systemfault> ChrisBinge: The second argument of $() is for a parent
[23:58:08] <ChrisBinge> so reverse the order?
[23:58:37] <systemfault> $('> .some-class', parent)
[23:59:13] <ChrisBinge> systemfault, awesome thanks!
