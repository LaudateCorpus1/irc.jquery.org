[04:36:02] <patchie> Hi all! i just created a tampermonkey script, that i dont get to work. Anyone wanna help me? https://pastebin.com/hNrBJ2ZF
[04:36:10] <patchie> The script should remove all sport related articles.
[15:49:31] <t2mkn> var e = $('#item').clone(); how can i do like e.find('.name').html("my new value"); ? the .find seems not woring. am i doing something wrong?
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> t2mkn without seeing the html, no clue.
[15:51:31] <t2mkn> e.find('.name').html('my new value'); is that ok to use? robertmaxrees
[15:51:39] <robertmaxrees> it'd use .text(), but yeah.
[15:51:45] <robertmaxrees> though i wouldn't clone an element with an ID.
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nLwhb5a2/
[15:51:54] <robertmaxrees> works fine :shrug:
[15:54:04] <t2mkn> ya. i had problem in my code. thanks robertmaxrees
[15:54:17] <robertmaxrees> t2mkn now just fix up that id issue and you should be set :)
[15:54:30] <t2mkn> ya
[15:58:01] <t2mkn> robertmaxrees the problem is with <template> tag check https://jsfiddle.net/L6wsv3dz/
[15:58:23] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem?
[15:58:51] <t2mkn> don't know. it's not showing anything in output
[15:59:03] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.
[15:59:06] <robertmaxrees> for starters: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cdtjavro/
[15:59:50] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template
[16:02:26] <robertmaxrees> also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15930706/html-template-tag-and-jquery - t2mkn template tags aren't like normal html tags.
[16:05:01] <t2mkn> humm thats extra work
[16:05:05] <robertmaxrees> correct :)
[16:05:16] <robertmaxrees> and unsupported in some browsers so ymmv
[16:06:08] <t2mkn> ya
[16:07:13] <t2mkn> so i should create string var with html code instead of cloning
[16:07:38] <robertmaxrees> or use a real templating engine, depending.
[16:09:57] <t2mkn> ooook
[16:11:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
