[02:10:46] <asarch> Using Semantic-UI, how would you clear the content of a text input element by pressing its icon?: https://jsfiddle.net/7hjwtmr3/
[02:11:37] <robertmaxrees> asarch looks like that's just a boilerplate??
[02:12:06] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/qHzMCHQ.png ?
[02:12:31] <asarch> Sorry, sorry
[02:13:03] <asarch> This code should be there: https://pastebin.com/5sZcYadb
[02:13:23] <robertmaxrees> can you update the fiddle with your html and js then? :)
[02:13:37] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried and all that :)
[02:13:57] <asarch> https://jsfiddle.net/mksc674o/
[02:14:11] <asarch> Can you see the code?
[02:14:15] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[02:14:48] <robertmaxrees> so you just need to bind an event listener in this case.
[02:14:56] <robertmaxrees> that sets the value to an empy string.
[02:15:25] <asarch> From the Semantic-UI site: "Input icons do not receive pointer-events unless a link icon is used."
[02:15:50] <asarch> But how could I listen that event?
[02:15:51] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[02:15:58] <robertmaxrees> you'd use an event listener.
[02:16:03] <robertmaxrees> do you know what that is?
[02:18:49] <asarch> From the Dropdown List example, I know I need something like: $('.ui.dropdown')
[02:18:49] <asarch>   .dropdown()
[02:18:49] <asarch> ;
[02:19:09] <robertmaxrees> so heads-up: don't paste multi-line code snippets in the channel :)
[02:19:24] <robertmaxrees> and not sure what you're looking at, but nope.
[02:19:30] <asarch> Sorry, I pressed Enter instead Backspace
[02:19:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not an event listener.
[02:19:48] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you're not sure what an event listener is, then?
[02:20:05] <robertmaxrees> (nothing wrong with not knowing, btw - just trying to meet you where you're at :) )
[02:20:27] <asarch> I know, because the Eloquent JavaScript book, that there is two ways of do that, vanilla JavaScript and the jQuery way
[02:20:40] <robertmaxrees> but do you know how to do them at all?
[02:20:54] <asarch> No, I don't
[02:21:29] <robertmaxrees> okay - that's what i was asking :)  i highly suggest you checkout learn.jquery.com to get a grasp on the basics.  https://learn.jquery.com/events/ is all how to handle events.
[02:21:32] <asarch> In the vanilla way, I need to get the element, then assign the event
[02:21:42] <robertmaxrees> though you'll need a grasp on the basics of selecting, etc
[02:21:51] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jquery, it's pretty similar to vanilla js.
[02:25:19] <asarch> Then: 1) I need to name every <i></i> with a different name, 2) Then $( "<i element>" ).on( "click", function( event ) {$("<the input text>").setHtml("");})?
[02:25:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[02:25:44] <robertmaxrees> there's no "setHtml" in jquery.
[02:25:54] <robertmaxrees> and you don't want that anyway - you want to set the value.
[02:26:45] <robertmaxrees> also: you want to select using classes, not names, when possible.
[02:27:01] <asarch> $("input:text").val("");
[02:27:12] <robertmaxrees> erm, not necessarily.
[02:27:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd give those elements a class and then use DOM traversal to get from the clicked icon to the input.
[02:28:11] <robertmaxrees> so check out these tweaks: > nope.
[02:28:11] <robertmaxrees> [2021:03:19:23:29:36] <robertmaxree
[02:28:14] <robertmaxrees> woops!
[02:28:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bopuzs6L/
[02:28:28] <robertmaxrees> see the classes i added to the inputs and the is?
[02:28:44] <asarch> Every text input has its own icon, so, every icon will only clear the text input it belongs to
[02:28:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[02:29:01] <robertmaxrees> so you can accomplish that using DOM traversal :)
[02:29:12] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to handle each one separately.
[02:29:31] <asarch> Because, otherwise, I could use the "Reset" button to clear all the form inputs
[02:29:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[02:29:53] <asarch> So, how could I do that?
[02:30:09] <robertmaxrees> i've described it a few times now.
[02:30:18] <robertmaxrees> did you lkook at the changes I made?
[02:30:23] <robertmaxrees> the classes I added to the html.
[02:31:28] <asarch> Yeah, <input class="user-input-field" type="text" placeholder="First name...">
[02:31:40] <robertmaxrees> yep!  on on the icons.
[02:32:17] <robertmaxrees> so you select the icons, add a click handler, and in the handler you go to the closest div, then find the input, and set the value to an empty string.
[02:32:33] <asarch> <i class="delete-icon times link icon">
[02:34:02] <asarch> $("delete-icon").on("click", function( event ) {... });
[02:34:18] <robertmaxrees> would need to be a class selector, but yeah
[02:34:27] <asarch> How do you get the closest div?
[02:34:27] <robertmaxrees> though you won't need to pass the event object.
[02:34:42] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:34:43] <robertmaxrees> :)_
[02:36:08] * asarch writes notes...
[02:38:27] <asarch> Can you do the same with CSS?
[02:38:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[02:40:34] <asarch> The same effect but using only CSS?
[02:40:48] <robertmaxrees> what same effect?  bind an event listener to clear an input?
[02:40:57] <asarch> CSS seems to be "more powerful" than JS, right?
[02:41:06] <asarch> Yeah
[02:41:25] <robertmaxrees> no.  CSS is for styling.  not sure where you're getting the "more powerful" part from.  serves a completely different purpose.
[02:41:49] <asarch> Nowadays web development tutorial show a lot of CSS nice effects
[02:41:56] <asarch> Oh, I see
[02:42:06] <robertmaxrees> css can do effects, sure.  but it's called "cascading style sheets" for a reason.
[02:42:25] <robertmaxrees> javascript is how you build out interactivity.  you can do some things with CSS, but not things like this.
[02:44:55] <asarch> $(".delete-icon").closest("div").closest("input").val('')?
[02:45:02] <robertmaxrees> find the input.
[02:45:13] <robertmaxrees> .find('.user-input-field')
[02:46:10] <robertmaxrees> if you'd read the docs for closest, you would've noticed that it starts at the current element and then checks each ancestor, giving you the first element that matches the selector.
[02:46:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:54:50] <asarch> I broke the page. I did: console.log($('.delete-icon').closest('div'));
[02:55:01] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't break anything.
[02:55:20] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying what you mean by "broke"?
[02:55:38] <asarch> It just hangs
[02:55:56] <robertmaxrees> ? can you show me in the fiddle?
[02:56:01] <robertmaxrees> "hangs" doesn't mean anything fwiw.
[03:00:03] <asarch> How would you know what icon has been clicked? $(".delete-icon").on("click", function () {$('this').closest('div'); ...});
[03:00:34] <robertmaxrees> $('this') is trying to select <this> - you want $(this)
[03:00:41] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need to know which was clicked in that case.
[03:00:48] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use $(this) with DOM traversal :)
[03:02:58] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bopuzs6L/1/
[03:03:08] <robertmaxrees> freebie showing it working :)
[03:04:01] <asarch> I was this close to find the result! :-P
[03:04:15] <asarch> Thank you!
[03:04:18] <robertmaxrees> usually helpful if you try editing the fiddle and showing what you've got ;)
[03:04:23] <robertmaxrees> learn a lot quicker that way.
[03:04:27] <asarch> Thank you very much robertmaxrees :-)
[03:04:43] <asarch> I need a jQuery book
[03:04:51] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is that book.
[03:07:51] <asarch> jQuery is magic for me, it does a lot of stuffs with just two lines of code
[03:08:14] <asarch> s/is/is like/
[03:12:46] <robertmaxrees> that was the point :)  tho it's not nearly as popular as it once was.
