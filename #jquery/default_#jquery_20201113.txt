[16:53:00] <destramic> anyone have a solution on how to use jquery validation with nested input names? name="hello[world]" please
[16:56:09] <shoky_> destramic: what's the issue?
[16:57:38] <destramic> https://pastebin.com/xbLscFYk  form valid = true even if no value
[16:57:50] <destramic> so im guessing theres an issue with nested names
[17:00:13] <shoky_> destramic: there isn't
[17:03:05] <destramic> shoky_ ok i'll do some more testing, thank you
[17:57:28] <destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/uk5je4xv/6/  when clicking on the li's the value will show in console...but its delayed to the plugin
[17:58:30] <destramic> would a timer be best to tackle the onclick speed? as its executing before the plugin sets the input value
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:01:18] <destramic> the plugin onclick function, which sets the inputs value runs after the $('#earth-bonding li').click...so i dont get the true input val
[18:02:11] <destramic> https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/uk5je4xv/ timer added
[18:02:19] <destramic> is there a better solution please
[18:02:26] <robertmaxrees> did you build this plugin?
[18:02:31] <destramic> yes
[18:02:41] <robertmaxrees> then modify the plugin to accept a callback.
[18:02:55] <robertmaxrees> or emit events.
[18:03:01] <robertmaxrees> that you can listen for.
[18:03:44] <destramic> ok i'll look into emitting events, thank you
