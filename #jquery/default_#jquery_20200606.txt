[05:15:19] <onizu> does anyone know of a js script to export <table> in xls format and that works with colspan/rowspan?
[06:09:15] <codecutter> This image does not fit into container, how would i position it so that the middle part is visible https://codepen.io/apprence/pen/KKVwKBN
[06:11:08] <codecutter> objective is to initially display the centre part of the image and then a user can drag it up or down to the desired part and save that offset for the future

[07:21:44] <codecutter> anyone?
[14:40:12] <gnstaxo> how do I check if a element is hidden?
[15:08:00] <codecutter> Using the jquery's draggable widget, to move the image up and down to the desired position, the initial position of the image (part that is visible in the container) is midpoint (align-items: center) , when image is moved up or down the position value needs to be relative to the midpoint e.g. if the image is pulled down, value would be negative and positive when pull up. The function dragCover() assumes the image is
[15:08:00] <codecutter>  position at the top (e.g. top part is only visible if the image is too big for the container) and compares the height of element that is being dragged (image) with the height of the parent,  but since the initial position is now set at the midpoint, how can I do correct position value  relative to the image midpoint?

[21:47:40] <gnstaxo> jquery doesn't work on android?
[21:51:18] <Hoppelhase> How so?
[21:54:08] <gnstaxo> like, when you interact from a mobile device
[21:54:29] <gnstaxo> you tap on buttons that are supposed to trigger an event
[22:49:16] <Hoppelhase> gnstaxo: So how doesn't it work for you?
[22:49:38] <Hoppelhase> jQuery is supposed to work with every modern browser
[23:29:41] <xae-x12> Hi I would like to remove these things to make my code HTML5 valid https://dpaste.org/HcwZ
[23:30:42] <xae-x12> I can't figure out how to remove them in python X)
[23:31:03] <xae-x12> I tried $('#id_captcha_0').removeAttr('required'); and that doesn't work
[23:31:18] <xae-x12> idk if it is the python package or what
[23:34:38] <Hoppelhase> What mean it didn't work? What's the result if you query the attribute afterwards?
[23:35:19] <Hoppelhase> For validation you probably want to remove it when the HTML is created
[23:35:48] <xae-x12> when i try that line of code nothing changes the required still remains
[23:35:58] <xae-x12> yes is that possible with jquery?
[23:36:48] <Hoppelhase> You can only modify the DOM with JS/jQuery after the page has been loaded
[23:37:17] <xae-x12> dang so there is no way then for html5 validator to see it in time?
[23:38:06] <Hoppelhase> No, the validator looks at the static document
[23:38:41] <xae-x12> ah dang oh well i guess i will just have to leave it non valid if i can't figure it out in python
[23:39:34] <xae-x12> thank you
