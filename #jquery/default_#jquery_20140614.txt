[07:12:35] <Saddy> Hello
[07:12:51] <Saddy> Any assistant around? i could use some help in a JQuery thing
[07:13:37] <sacho_> don't ask to ask.
[07:13:57] <Saddy> fair enough;
[07:14:21] <Saddy> i am trying to save the position of an element after dragging it using the draggable ; save position in sql server to recall it later
[07:18:02] <decx> get offset in the stopfunction and post that to your server
[07:18:47] <decx> like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Lq8xf/
[07:19:37] <Saddy> decx, any example of how to post it to my server? i am a newbie on this
[07:19:56] <decx> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[07:26:50] <Saddy> decx, what i am trying to do, is once the drag of a specific element stopped, it connects to the sql server and saves the position of the element that was dragged
[07:27:05] <Saddy> and first time i use jquery, so can't actually understand how to manipulate that
[07:27:56] <decx> what kind of backend?
[07:29:00] <sacho_> Why don't you split your problem into smaller ones
[07:29:51] <Saddy> sql server, using asp.net/c#
[07:29:59] <sacho_> Try implementing a function that takes data, and sends it to your server.
[07:30:04] <sacho_> (irrelevant where the data comes from).
[07:30:23] <Saddy> could i get an example? as i never worked with javascript nor jquery, am a backend guy
[07:30:24] <Saddy> c#
[07:30:25] <sacho_> Then try implementing a function that gets the position of an element when you've finished dragging it.
[07:30:44] <sacho_> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[07:30:49] <Saddy> I get your idea, thought about it plenty of time, but have no idea how to make it happen
[07:31:46] <alpercinar> hi all ! why is document.getElementById("asd") is faster than jquery equivalent $("#asd")
[07:32:21] <sacho_> because $('#asd') creates a jquery object.
[07:32:36] <jParkton> is this one of those .000000000000000003 nanosecond speed things again
[07:32:39] <sacho_> it's not meaningfully faster.
[07:32:44] <jParkton> I may have to punch my wife
[07:33:16] <decx> Saddy basicly like this http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Lq8xf/1/ have an endpoint and then you can post to it in the stopfunction with the offset as parameters http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Lq8xf/1/
[07:33:25] <decx> double urled even not bad :>
[07:33:26] <alpercinar> thx for the answer

[08:03:16] <Jattenalle> yeah, sue me, im too lazy to copy it myself ;)
[08:03:17] <jParkton> k
[08:04:30] <DansVC> hi :D
[08:04:34] <DansVC> someone helps me?
[08:06:25] <Jattenalle> DansVC, you havent asked a question
[08:07:22] <DansVC> ok, my website stop when I use the window.open
[08:08:14] <DansVC> in the console of Chrome says: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[08:08:16] <DansVC> :s
[08:08:51] <DansVC> I think that I have a loop of a function but I didnt :(
[08:09:11] <jParkton> Jattenalle: http://jsfiddle.net/3wUBg/1/
[08:11:16] <DansVC> my website: http://ray-dee-oh.com/ (you have just to swipe to left)
[08:11:59] <Jattenalle> jParkton, the getJSON never runs for me in that fiddle :/
[08:18:22] <Jattenalle> jParkton, i dont know what's wrong, i cant seem to get jsfiddle to work at all, something just derped out on my end
[08:21:54] <jParkton> dang
[08:22:00] <jParkton> another weird thing
[08:22:23] <jParkton> in my console if I log typeof names I get object,but on jsfiddle it says array
[08:24:45] <jParkton> and Object.keys(names) gives me ["0"] three times
[08:24:58] <jParkton> im doing something wrong clearly
[08:24:59] <jParkton> lol
[08:27:26] <Jattenalle> uh http://jsfiddle.net/3wUBg/3/
[08:27:52] <Jattenalle> that's not very helpful at all..
[08:28:29] <Jattenalle> also, what's with the startsWith and such in the fiddle you linked?
[08:32:28] <jParkton> oh
[08:32:39] <jParkton> it was an earlier excersize
[08:33:10] <Jattenalle> anyhow, yeah i just get a massive error returned by getJSON
[08:33:30] <jParkton> https://github.com/jparkton/DataTest/blob/master/index.js#L12
[08:33:50] <Jattenalle> check the fiddle i linked
[08:39:29] <jiffe98> anyone know a way to dynamically change the background color associated with the sEmptyTable row when using datatables?
[08:40:25] <jiffe98> I tried setting table.fnSettings().nTBody.rows[0].cells[0].className = 'classname' but .table-striped tbody tr:nth-child(odd) td, .table-striped tbody tr:nth-child(odd) th overrides this
[08:42:46] <jiffe98> nm setting !impotant works
[08:43:16] <jParkton> hmm
[08:43:26] <jParkton> ED much?
[08:43:39] <jParkton> nvm that's impotent
[08:45:09] <jiffe98> !impotent would actually make more sense than !important from a boolean perspective
[08:56:48] <mogaj> how to get the dynamically generated radio select value ... http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/v3p6Y/1/
[09:01:04] <Saddy> decx: i played around and got it to work, inserting the position to sql, but any idea how to get the id of the specific control that is being dragged ?
[09:33:35] <guest13421> can we get list of text having same class in array?
[09:34:49] <guest13421> example: I have 3 span tags having same class. I want their text in form of array.
[09:35:22] <forgotmynick> how do i find out which script made a change to an element?
[09:38:32] <ravenzz> guest13421 yeah you can use jQuery.map() and .map()
[09:39:01] <guest13421> ravenzz: looking at it :)
[09:40:04] <ravenzz> forgotmynick it is for debuggin purposes only?
[09:41:44] <forgotmynick> ravenzz yes, something is increasing the image size on mouseover but i don't know where to look and the eventlisteners in chromes developer tools is overwhelming
[09:42:10] <guest13421> ravenzz: I am trying something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jayesh92/XZV2j/1/.  on button click need to get those highlighted words.
[09:42:48] <arunbabu> I am trying to make some entries to a webpage but unfortunately the text box in at the bottom part. After every entry i need to manually scroll down to bottom-est part to see the autocorrect entries of input text field. Can I have some snippet to make the page always scroll to bottom?
[09:43:01] <ravenzz> forgotmynick oh so do you actually know when the change is made? (eg. mouseover)
[09:45:30] <arunbabu> Can I have code snippet to keep a webpage scrolled to bottom position irrespective of the changes I make?
[09:46:30] <forgotmynick> ravenzz yes the change is made on mouseover. also, if it helps, forcing the element state to hover, focus, or active, doesn't reproduce the same affect
[09:49:37] <forgotmynick> so a class was getting added to the element and i searched for that and found the script causing this. i would, if anyone can spare the time, like to know how i can find out using developer tools?
[09:52:03] <ravenzz> forgotmynick I was thinking that you can maybe extend jQuery.fn.on temporary and add a breakpoint
[09:53:04] <forgotmynick> good idea
[09:53:24] <forgotmynick> the script was using mouseenter not mouseover jQuery('.bbg_img', this).mouseenter(function() {
[10:15:53] <richurs> i have a url like domain.com/?id=xx how can i add &city=yy to it ?

[15:45:02] <Hyperking> http://plnkr.co/edit/NqI0LKCD3au1FUftEfmB
[15:46:19] <Hyperking> according to leaflet api this method should be used but doesn't offer any examples http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#geojson-pointtolayer
[15:50:05] <Hyperking> everyone busy?

[15:57:51] <antlong_> Hyperking did you google it?
[15:58:01] <antlong_> Hyperking i found a demo with code in 10 seconds
[15:58:02] <Hyperking> antlong_:thanks for responding, but I have been serching all day and night
[15:58:38] <jParkton> corner cases

[16:00:42] <Tomashe> Hey guys, anyone knows how to scroll bottom inner div?
[16:01:04] <jParkton> wut?
[16:01:19] <Tomashe> i made a phonegap app
[16:01:23] <Tomashe> html/css
[16:01:31] <Tomashe> i want to scroll down my div
[16:01:49] <Tomashe> so i can see my bottom part
[16:02:11] <Hyperking> antlong_: Wow, I was calling L.Icon ... but needed to call L.icon ...crying
[16:02:15] <antlong_> Hyperking ;)
[16:02:23] <antlong_> Hyperking sometimes you're not really looking when you're looking.
[16:03:06] <Hyperking> its been so streesfull. I knew it had to work, it was killing me
[16:03:13] <bung> is plunker the new jsfiddle?
[16:03:18] <Hyperking> but big thanks
[16:03:23] <antlong_> you're welcome
[16:03:33] <bung> ...been away for a while, out of the loop
[16:03:37] <erming> Tomashe: i've made a jQuery plugin doing that
[16:03:43] <erming> but here's the snippet for the scroll part: https://github.com/erming/stickyscroll/blob/gh-pages/stickyscroll.js#L89-L93
[16:03:50] <Hyperking> bung: I like plunk because I can add the files I need
[16:04:00] <erming> you can snag that plugin function if you'd like
[16:05:54] <Tomashe> let me see
[16:07:24] <Tomashe> erming: how do i work with it
[16:08:14] <Tomashe> justmy container and .sticky
[16:10:15] <Tomashe> that sticky isnt working :(
[16:10:27] <erming> http://erming.github.io/stickyscroll/
[16:10:30] <erming> thats how it's supposed to work
[16:10:37] <erming> $(".target").sticky();
[16:10:41] <Tomashe> yes i can see it but its not working for me
[16:10:52] <Tomashe> my problem is on FIRST load
[16:11:05] <erming> then use .scrollToBottom()
[16:11:23] <erming> now, the demo kinda suck for my plugin (going to fix some real documentation some day)
[16:11:39] <antlong_> does anyone have recommendations for a tutorial plugin, something like pageguide?
[16:11:40] <erming> but calling .sticky() should automatically scroll to bottom for you
[16:11:55] <erming> as long as $(".target") is the actual div with the scroll
[16:12:08] <Tomashe> its not really scrolling evn with .scrollToBottom()
[16:12:42] <erming> you see this line: https://github.com/erming/stickyscroll/blob/gh-pages/stickyscroll.js#L91
[16:13:16] <erming> or well
[16:13:21] <erming> here's some other code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10503606/scroll-to-bottom-of-div-on-page-load-jquery
[16:13:41] <erming> i got to go.. good luck
[16:13:45] <Tomashe> maybe i got some other issues i dont know
[16:13:47] <Tomashe> but thanks mate
[16:45:46] <antlong_> does joyride have a bottom-right option?

[22:44:08] <sebastian_> What re the most popular channels on freenode ?
[22:47:32] <Xgear> hum, how do you go about preventing effects overqueue with two different selectors? (parent/child)?

[22:59:58] <x-finite> I have noticed on some grid themes that they leave more space to the right than to the left with the grid being on the middle. Is there some kind of design limitation that i fail to understand?
