[00:37:47] <silverdust> In the animate docs https://api.jquery.com/animate/ it says you can set values like width: "toggle", height: "toggle"
[00:38:03] <silverdust> how does it know the values to toggle within
[00:38:31] <silverdust> For regular 2 state values like show
[00:38:50] <silverdust> and hide it's understandable
[00:39:13] <silverdust> but I'm lost here
[03:18:05] <prillian5> I check with typeof jQuery if jQuery is defined, if not defined, it should be loaded. Here my script: https://jsfiddle.net/Lyar1dcg/1/
[03:18:44] <prillian5> But the console.log(typeof jQuery) result in "undefined". why?
[03:20:19] <prillian5> If I execute this js in chrome-console, and try console.log(typeof jQuery); again, it output "function"
[03:50:16] <suexec> http://pastebin.com/kHb0YMzC <- Works in chrome. Not in explorer. Explorer says "event.target" is a null reference. Any ideas ?
[04:11:50] <Cork> suexec: what version of jquery?
[04:11:54] <Cork> and what version if ie
[04:16:13] <suexec> Cork, Jquery-1.9.1. I.e 10.0
[04:17:33] <Cork> suexec: sounds weird, does have you checked what event.originalEvent shows?
[04:17:38] <Cork> uh...
[04:17:58] <Cork> /does have/have/
[04:18:13] <hellyeah> my button width:30px height:30px but when i try to get in jquery  width seem 14.8 height seem 24.8 what is the reason of that  http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/38/
[04:20:33] <suexec> Cork, as in, console.log(event.originalEvent); .. ? In chrome that's undefined
[04:20:42] <Cork> hmm
[04:20:47] <Cork> one min
[04:20:52] <hellyeah> now chrome sucks?
[04:21:44] <Cork> suexec: event.originalEvent should exist
[04:21:52] <Cork> it should be the browsers native event object
[04:24:16] <suexec> Cork, ummm .. well, the dblclick works .. haha.
[04:24:19] <suexec> wtf
[04:25:15] <hellyeah> why "wtf" xD
[04:26:42] <suexec> It's a wtf if the object doesn't exist, but still is able to extract the id and actually remove itself
[04:27:32] <suexec> Cork, event.originalEVent doesn't exist. event.currentTarget does.
[04:35:20] <Cork> suexec: hmm, is this a faked event?
[04:35:54] <suexec> Cork, $("#cc_container").dblclick(function() { <- triggers it
[04:35:57] <Cork> suexec: event.* is jquerys compatibility event object, it always sets an event.originalEvent containing the original event object
[04:36:10] <suexec> if dblclick fakes something, then yes.
[04:36:15] <Cork> AH
[04:36:23] <Cork> suexec: your using window.event
[04:36:26] <hellyeah> dblclic
[04:36:38] <Cork> suexec: function() { => function(event) {
[04:36:46] <Cork> that should solve the problem
[04:37:10] <hellyeah> why do i need dblclick?
[04:38:14] <hellyeah> tayfun: are you Turkish?
[04:38:52] <tayfun> yes im. why did u ask
[04:39:24] <hellyeah> just wondering
[04:39:38] <hellyeah> this is Turkish name thats why :p
[04:39:42] <tayfun> how did u know ^_^
[04:39:58] <tayfun> tayfun means Typhoon
[04:39:59] <hellyeah> i am turkish also xD
[04:40:27] <tayfun> ha tamam ok :)
[04:40:34] <hellyeah> haehha
[04:40:45] <hellyeah> anyway
[04:41:28] <tayfun> where do u work?
[04:41:40] <suexec> Cork, that triggered the originalEvent for chrome - let me run over and check how i.e behaves now
[04:41:56] <Cork> suexec: you don't need to use originalEvent
[04:42:02] <hellyeah> company
[04:42:03] <hellyeah> :X
[04:42:08] <Cork> suexec: event like you used it should work just fine if you just change the function(event) part
[04:42:13] <tayfun> T_T kk
[04:42:24] <tayfun> top secret^_^
[04:42:51] <hellyeah> tayfun: ask your question :xd
[04:43:09] <tayfun> hellyeah: which company are u working in? :p
[04:43:28] <hellyeah> this channel is not for chit chat :X
[04:45:23] <suexec> Cork, yeah, I know mate. Was just to verify that I did indeed have a bug. Worked like a charm in i.e as well now. Cheers !
[05:29:31] <MacroMan> The docs for detach state that events are kept, however draggable seems to turn off after detaching and inserting the element elsewhere
[05:29:45] <MacroMan> droppable seems to still work fine.
[05:32:54] <MacroMan> Hmm. Actually I seem to be having other problems here. Don't worry.
[05:49:31] <shibly> How can i upload multiple files with javascript?
[05:49:52] <shibly> How can i write the form for javascript upload? <form action="upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
[05:50:05] <shibly> Anyone there?
[06:00:10] <sigdk> Hello, I'm having the following modal: https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/11/  I'd like to trigger a function upon its close. The code here doesn't do that... any idea how to fix it ?
[06:03:24] <shibly> Can anyone answer?
[06:05:02] <rominronin> May I ask a JS question, or will i be banished to #javascript?
[06:05:51] <Uhkis> sigdk: does that plugin have such an event?
[06:06:47] <sigdk> Uhkis, I was verifying this right now... I found this: https://github.com/FinelySliced/leanModal.js/pull/37/files?short_path=04c6e90
[06:08:34] <Uhkis> sigdk: so use custom version of the plugin with that merged and it should work
[06:12:35] <sigdk> Uhkis, ok, I'm a bit confused. I thought I already use that one
[06:12:42] <sigdk> how do I fetch the custom version ?
[06:20:38] <_lazarevsky> hello all
[06:20:42] <_lazarevsky> I want to simulate keyclick
[06:20:49] <_lazarevsky> right arrow click rather
[06:21:10] <_lazarevsky> $('#input_id').trigger(event) where event is right click
[06:21:13] <_lazarevsky> is that even possible?
[06:21:15] <_lazarevsky> thanks so much
[06:36:14] <hellyeah> let say i can drag and drop an object and i move my object onto another object. And i want to trigger an event in that case. mouseover event can handle this case?
[06:49:45] <shibly> Is it possible to upload files with $.ajax() function?
[07:00:29] <Cork> shibly: yes
[07:00:50] <Cork> shibly: you need to use an object container that can contain the data though (formData)
[07:00:57] <hellyeah> hmm i knoÄ±w it is really simple why click function didnt work http://jsfiddle.net/wqnvv012/42/
[07:01:04] <Cork> shibly: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData
[07:01:33] <Cork> shibly: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects#Submitting_forms_and_uploading_files_via_AJAX_without_FormData_objects
[07:01:54] <Uhkis> hellyeah: yes it works
[07:02:06] <hellyeah> it is not working here
[07:02:10] <hellyeah> damn
[07:02:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:02:48] <hellyeah> it worked on ie but not chrome
[07:03:12] <sigdk> Uhkis, my modal doesn't seem to work as expected. I would highly apreciate it if you could have a look (https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/11/)
[07:03:42] <hellyeah> wow
[07:03:53] <hellyeah> alert mess up chrome
[07:05:36] <sigdk> actually, here 's an updated version with the correct leanModel.js: https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/12/
[07:08:45] <Uhkis> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/rzym5beu/13/ bound the event lower, there's some bug in that plugin code
[07:09:13] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/yudydgw1/ <--- can you tell me why #profile is never inserted?
[07:09:17] <Kartagis> line 38
[07:09:51] <hellyeah> hey buttons are draggable you can drop it is there an event i can trigger when i move my button onto or under another button http://jsfiddle.net/fru2k1q3/5/
[07:09:57] <sigdk> what do you mean by "bound the event lower" ?
[07:11:43] <Uhkis> Kartagis: because you're not binding that click handler to already existing element
[07:11:56] <Uhkis> sigdk: 'body' instead of that modal div's id
[07:12:23] <Uhkis> Kartagis: oh wait, it works
[07:12:34] <sigdk> thanks, seems to work... I'll experiment a bit more
[07:14:59] <Uhkis> Kartagis: you need pd.insertAfter
[07:15:18] <Uhkis> Kartagis: and don't duplicate id's
[07:17:30] <Kartagis> dupe id'd?
[07:17:33] <Kartagis> where?
[07:17:41] <Kartagis> id's*
[07:18:24] <Uhkis> Kartagis: well you give id to that element and it seems like something that might be duplicated later on
[07:18:32] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:21:23] <hellyeah> taplar: hello
[07:21:28] <hellyeah> may i ask something?
[07:21:29] <sigdk> what is the difference between jquery*.js and jquery*min.js files ?  I guess the later are used in production and have less size. How do I convert from one type to the other ?
[07:21:52] <Cork> sigdk: .min. is minified javascript
[07:22:00] <taplar> hellyeah: what's up?
[07:22:19] <hellyeah> i prepared mvp yesterday  btw
[07:22:25] <taplar> cool
[07:22:32] <hellyeah> at home
[07:22:37] <hellyeah> :xd
[07:23:22] <hellyeah> anyway i need to kknow is there an event in case two objects are collided. you can drag and drop object here http://jsfiddle.net/fru2k1q3/6/
[07:23:23] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I have done that with jquery just because it looks ugly if I create it on HTML side
[07:23:45] <hellyeah> Kartagis: inline coding?
[07:23:46] <taplar> i'm not helping you with that
[07:24:04] <hellyeah> taplar: okey i respect that
[07:24:06] <Kartagis> what do you mean by that hellyeah?
[07:24:17] <hellyeah> jquery code inside html
[07:24:42] <hellyeah> taplar: can i ask the reason? :/
[07:24:55] <Kartagis> no no, I first created div in html, but it looked ugly so I did it with jquery
[07:24:59] <taplar> if it's about getting your mvp into production, yes, :)
[07:25:00] <Kartagis> hellyeah: ^
[07:25:32] <taplar> you didn't get your mvp made, tested and into production over 24 hours
[07:25:40] <hellyeah> Kartagis: i heard if you created dom iwith jquery or javascript you can lose responsiveness etc.
[07:25:42] <taplar> so i can only guess your trying to ask about your other stuff
[07:26:06] <Uhkis> taplar: most valuable player?!
[07:26:15] <hellyeah> i didnt finish yet
[07:26:17] <taplar> jk?
[07:26:17] <Kartagis> not if you also assign the related div's
[07:26:21] <hellyeah> i have just 1 hour everyday
[07:26:28] <Kartagis> classes*
[07:26:33] <hellyeah> to make my mvp
[07:26:48] <taplar> so, do it
[07:26:51] <hellyeah> anyway thank you
[07:27:11] <hellyeah> taplar: with my respect, i am doing at home
[07:27:13] <hellyeah> out of office hour
[07:27:48] <taplar> not sure how that is significant
[07:28:04] <hellyeah> in office i need to finish requirements :D
[07:28:12] <taplar> yup
[07:28:15] <Uhkis> not sure how mvp is related to this at all
[07:28:18] <taplar> mvp IS a requirement
[07:28:26] <taplar> minimal viable product
[07:28:38] <hellyeah> Uhkis: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product
[07:28:55] <taplar> he's currently trapped in the development cycle of doing something and users asking for more
[07:28:58] <taplar> he's never going to get done
[07:29:11] <hellyeah> thats not my fault :D
[07:29:20] <taplar> you need to try to break out of it
[07:29:38] <hellyeah> i understand
[07:29:56] <taplar> in the -least-, on your development environment
[07:30:06] <taplar> doesn't have to be to production, though that is the best case
[07:30:53] <hellyeah> my plan is like that
[07:31:06] <hellyeah> finishing these requirement and make mvp at the same time
[07:31:20] <hellyeah> and ask for is that your last requirements?
[07:31:40] <Uhkis> taplar: that's basically every it project ever :D
[07:31:41] <taplar> 'do all of this stuff' and 'do mvp' isn't really the same thing
[07:32:02] <taplar> the whole point of the mvp is just to give a small piece.  an -important- piece, but a piece
[07:32:13] <hellyeah> i got it
[07:32:29] <hellyeah> i actualtl show some piece to him
[07:32:47] <taplar> Uhkis: not really.  maybe traditionally.  but look at groups like chrome, firefox with their rolling updates.  those are iterative development which this is a lead into.  we also do it in my shop now
[07:33:41] <Uhkis> taplar: and how is that not devving while users ask for more? ;)
[07:34:00] <hellyeah> what does devving mean?
[07:34:08] <taplar> they can ask for more.  but your doing it in small pieces.  your not doing it all and then bam!  deployed
[07:34:09] <Uhkis> developing
[07:34:20] <taplar> they get each small functioning piece as it's made
[07:34:21] <hellyeah> ic
[07:34:24] <taplar> so they don't wait as long
[07:34:31] <Uhkis> taplar: of course not, there's this buzzword "agile" for it
[07:34:39] <taplar> uh, no
[07:34:40] <hellyeah> scrum?
[07:34:46] <taplar> agile =/= iterative
[07:35:10] <hellyeah> iterative is like building block by block
[07:35:10] <taplar> i know groups that do 'agile' waterfall development
[07:35:19] <hellyeah> so you have many flats at the end
[07:35:57] <hellyeah> hmm i dont know
[07:36:14] <hellyeah> my situtation is i am new on job i need tha tjob thats why i try to do everything
[07:36:26] <hellyeah> Country i live in sucks huge nowadays
[07:36:30] <hellyeah> so i dont have a choice
[07:36:39] <hellyeah> i am kindly asking for help
[07:36:44] <taplar> and when they look at you in three months and you haven't given anything to the users yet?
[07:37:04] <hellyeah> i gave a lot of things
[07:37:17] <hellyeah> but he wants new thing there can be tw meaning
[07:37:18] <taplar> in regards to this project
[07:37:53] <hellyeah> first- he is really satisfied and he has lot of thing on his mind. So he instinctly said "i have a chance to carry on everything in project"
[07:38:23] <hellyeah> second- he is shocked i did everything he asked he force me to see the thing i didnt do
[07:38:26] <Uhkis> hellyeah: what country is that? (if you don't mind me asking)
[07:38:29] <hellyeah> i wont do*
[07:38:33] <hellyeah> Turkey
[07:40:04] <hellyeah> i am here like one and half year
[07:40:13] <hellyeah> now i have a chance to design all ui
[07:40:19] <hellyeah> this is really big chance
[07:40:32] <hellyeah> thats why i try to do everything he asked me to do
[07:40:39] <hellyeah> i am deadly honest
[07:40:48] <taplar> i know
[07:40:48] <hellyeah> but sure i respect you guys
[07:41:53] <hellyeah> may be this is so personal but i am disabled person from my eyes so this was really hard to find such jobs. As a plus i am qualified those stuff fortunattely
[07:42:30] <taplar> i'm not trying to be disrespectful.  i'm simply trying to encourage you to apply, and possibly request, more structure in your development cycle.
[07:42:52] <taplar> from a users standpoint.  the faster i get something, the more likely i'm happier
[07:43:01] <hellyeah> taplar: my english is kinda limited
[07:43:06] <taplar> which, your coding for the end users at the end of the day.  not your manager
[07:43:13] <hellyeah> taplar: i understand your intension perfectly
[07:43:39] <taplar> unless your manager is your end user
[07:43:46] <hellyeah> i constantly ask people who use that system
[07:43:55] <hellyeah> and i get their feeedback frequently
[07:44:05] <hellyeah> my manager is also end user
[07:44:16] <taplar> how many users you got?  ruffly?
[07:44:23] <hellyeah> well
[07:44:24] <hellyeah> ten
[07:44:37] <taplar> true, it's an admin screen so that would be small
[07:44:53] <hellyeah> well
[07:45:01] <taplar> so the stuff that your screen is going to do for them.  how are they accomplishing that work today?
[07:45:10] <hellyeah> people from different department watch screen, some service
[07:45:22] <taplar> there's another screen already?
[07:45:24] <hellyeah> that can be much in different times
[07:45:30] <hellyeah> that can be used widely
[07:45:51] <hellyeah> taplar: yes there is another screen already
[07:45:59] <hellyeah> show tables, graphs
[07:46:10] <hellyeah> but this is like distributed
[07:46:25] <hellyeah> and hard to follow they try to collect everything into one screen
[07:46:45] <hellyeah> so i guess he wants so many spesific thing
[07:46:52] <hellyeah> he wants to group button
[07:46:53] <taplar> so they have pain points in collecting the information.  and your new screen will do that
[07:47:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:47:23] <hellyeah> i dont know meaning of pain points but
[07:47:33] <hellyeah> i understand somehow yes thats true
[07:47:45] <hellyeah> think about this
[07:47:45] <taplar> it's lingo, don't know how new/old, but refers to issues in a process that make it difficult
[07:48:12] <hellyeah> we have network and iis deparment
[07:48:17] <taplar> well, it can refer to more difficult or take more time than necessary
[07:48:31] <hellyeah> two departments have so many services assign to button
[07:48:46] <hellyeah> that want to group those button to see everything in one place
[07:48:57] <taplar> lol
[07:49:08] <taplar> no matter what i say, the convo keeps going back there...
[07:49:16] <hellyeah> convo?
[07:49:20] <taplar> conversation
[07:49:38] <hellyeah> taplar: i just try to tell the situtaton
[07:49:42] <hellyeah> situtation
[07:50:04] <taplar> i'm not the only dude here.  others can help you group draggable buttons
[07:50:26] <hellyeah> sure
[07:50:40] <hellyeah> i got you saying and i respect that i try to prepare mvp
[07:50:45] <hellyeah> as soon as possible
[07:51:29] <hellyeah> anyway thansk for reading
[07:56:18] <hellyeah> taplar: i will show you when it is done
[07:56:35] <taplar> you shouldn't be able to
[07:56:40] <taplar> it's an admin screen, :)
[07:57:05] <hellyeah> just demonstration
[07:57:12] <hellyeah> with random data
[07:57:13] <hellyeah> :X
[07:57:28] <taplar> k, though that's not 'done', :P
[07:57:44] <taplar> but i'm nitpicking now
[07:57:53] <hellyeah> so many piece all around
[07:58:19] <hellyeah> but i guess you are right
[07:58:22] <hellyeah> it will never end
[07:58:29] <hellyeah> i need to force my manager
[07:58:36] <hellyeah> that may be the lesson i need to learn
[07:58:41] <taplar> 'encourage'
[07:58:44] <taplar> 'request'
[07:58:47] <taplar> :)
[07:58:57] <taplar> make the case
[07:59:11] <hellyeah> yeah thanks
[07:59:12] <hellyeah> brb
[07:59:15] <taplar> in regards to this particular project, the users haven't gotten anything from you yet
[07:59:19] <hellyeah> you are really good person
[07:59:35] <taplar> if you can give them small pieces, they can benifit from those while you continue making the other small pieces
[07:59:38] <hellyeah> always request always request
[07:59:49] <hellyeah> ye you are right
[07:59:58] <hellyeah> i need to go toilet
[07:59:59] <hellyeah> :X
[08:00:19] <taplar> gotta layoff the coffee man, ;)
[08:02:23] * taplar says that while blowing on his own cup

[08:34:42] <taplar> not personally

[08:47:58] <tykayn-ubuntu> hi folks
[08:48:32] <tykayn-ubuntu> i have an issue with a plugin named flexslider, it keeps on being undefined despite my includes
[08:48:59] <taplar> your including your logic after the include?
[08:49:05] <tykayn-ubuntu> yup
[08:49:13] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[08:49:16] <Uhkis> taplar: dunno, i'm not into buzzwords
[08:49:27] <tykayn-ubuntu> in the console, if i write jQuery.fn. it is not listed
[08:49:32] <tykayn-ubuntu> k ill fiddle it
[08:49:35] <taplar> oh
[08:49:40] <taplar> you don't have jquery imported then
[08:49:57] <taplar> err wait
[08:50:06] <taplar> it's not listed in .fn, or jQuery is undefined?
[08:51:20] <taplar> Uhkis: i take it your a big fan of html5 then, ;)
[08:54:33] <tykayn-ubuntu> http://jsfiddle.net/tykayn/4sw9ggL2/
[08:54:41] <km4> hi, I have this problem : http://jsfiddle.net/vq8kfxu4/ . I need show body panel when mouseover button and I try to normal hover this body.
[08:54:43] <tykayn-ubuntu> taplar: not listed in fn
[08:55:00] <tykayn-ubuntu> k i am not sure of how jsfiddle works now
[08:55:03] <hellyeah> you didnt include jquery
[08:55:24] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/4sw9ggL2/1/
[08:55:30] <hellyeah> return undefined
[08:56:12] <tykayn-ubuntu> i included it in dependencies
[08:56:23] <hellyeah> check your console
[08:56:35] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/4sw9ggL2/2/
[08:56:36] <cool_boy> hi there, how to format a number 2 decimal points? 5.toFixed(2) gives me 5.00 how to get 0.05 ?
[08:56:41] <tykayn-ubuntu> in external ressources
[08:56:57] <taplar> i used the jquery option from jsfiddle rather than the external one
[08:57:05] <cool_boy> other than multiplying by 0.01
[08:57:11] <km4> cool_boy: /100
[08:57:42] <tykayn-ubuntu> oh ok, now the javascript panel has a button to include libs
[08:57:48] <taplar> yep
[08:57:50] <cool_boy> km4: thanks any other approach? it is same as multiplying by 0.01
[08:58:11] <hellyeah> guys pls allow me to ask this when i move button onto another one i try to create div and add to mainpart but it doesnt work. Can you help me to figure out why? http://jsfiddle.net/fru2k1q3/8/
[08:58:30] <taplar> don't know if it was like that on your actual page or not, but you added your jquery include below your flexslider include which would be wrong
[08:58:33] <taplar> jquery needs to come first
[08:58:37] <hellyeah> tykayn-ubuntu: it seems they change the place
[08:59:04] <hellyeah> there was a framework thing now it is on javascript part
[08:59:14] <tykayn-ubuntu> still not including flexslider
[08:59:38] <tykayn-ubuntu> but you can see it requested as external resource
[08:59:38] <taplar> in the fiddle i gave?
[09:01:41] <hellyeah> tykayn-ubuntu: this is the output i see  var namespace = slider.vars.namespace,
[09:01:41] <hellyeah>         msGâ¦
[09:04:57] <taplar> cool_boy: i believe your going to have to do some form of multiplication or division, or condiational string concatenation.  because what your describing isn't really formatting.  your doing a conversion
[09:05:04] <taplar> 5 !== 0.05
[09:05:15] <tykayn-ubuntu> hellyeah: where do you see that ?
[09:05:26] <hellyeah> in console
[09:05:30] <hellyeah> do f12
[09:08:37] <tykayn-ubuntu> erm, now it works http://jsfiddle.net/tykayn/4sw9ggL2/10/
[09:09:09] <tykayn-ubuntu> but still not working on my prestashop site
[09:10:07] <taplar> it is this guy right? http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[09:11:59] <tykayn-ubuntu> yup
[09:12:19] <taplar> dunno, so long as your jquery import is before your flexslider import it should be fine
[09:12:22] <tykayn-ubuntu> the network says the lib is loaded
[09:16:25] <taplar> km4: did you get help with your question?
[09:17:53] <tykayn-ubuntu> whoa ok, there were a lot of other libs included
[09:18:00] <tykayn-ubuntu> damn prestashop theme
[09:18:23] <tykayn-ubuntu> thanks guys :)
[09:18:29] <taplar> got it?
[09:18:36] <tykayn-ubuntu> now we know that libs inserted after can break all the things
[09:21:46] <km4> taplar_afk: noke
[09:23:03] <tykayn-ubuntu> ok there were some other jquery version inserted after my scripts
[09:28:34] <taplar> ah, that'll do it
[09:28:53] <taplar> km4: ok, so what was your question?  are you trying to do the show/hide with just css?
[09:28:58] <hellyeah> tykayn-ubuntu: put jquery to the beginning
[09:29:09] <hellyeah> jquery and your scripts
[09:29:25] <taplar> he is, there are just multiple jquery includes
[09:29:27] <tykayn-ubuntu> that is what i did, but you know, smarty template can hide loops
[09:29:33] <taplar> so the second one was destroying and recreating the jQuery object
[09:29:41] <tykayn-ubuntu> stupidy smarty
[09:29:42] <hellyeah> actually for "show()/hide()" you dont need css
[09:29:54] <taplar> if you can do it with css, you should
[09:29:59] <hellyeah> toggle() will do the trick
[09:30:04] <tykayn-ubuntu> agreed
[09:30:09] <taplar> actually you do need it
[09:30:15] <taplar> unless your doing detach and appends
[09:30:29] <hellyeah> what is the reason? just cariousity
[09:30:31] <taplar> show() hide() are wrappers for changing inline css
[09:30:39] <hellyeah> humm
[09:31:07] <TickedOffDev> Hey guys I got a different type of question actually. I have a client who keeps bombarding me with emails with tons of changes. I'm already undercharging for this project due to the other half of the shop management being my brother. How do I politely tell him to fuck off?
[09:31:28] <hellyeah> same story all over again
[09:31:29] <hellyeah> :D
[09:31:33] <taplar> hmm
[09:31:41] <slax0r> TickedOffDev: please politely fuck off
[09:31:44] <slax0r> ;)
[09:31:52] <hellyeah> TickedOffDev: you can say sod off
[09:31:59] <hellyeah> or buzz off
[09:32:03] <openstandards> TickedOffDev, you should of had a contract to state that you'll only make so many changes once the work has been signed off
[09:32:08] <taplar> i need to spell check this word
[09:32:21] <hellyeah> whic one taplar
[09:32:21] <taplar> there we go
[09:32:29] <slax0r> TickedOffDev: you don't need to tell anyone to fuck of, client says, yeah I want this and that, and that too! you respond, sure no problem! we agreed on other stuff, this will cost you X amount more
[09:32:37] <taplar> TickedOffDev: i might suggest to try to renegotiate the price of your work with them
[09:32:52] <taplar> so they know it isn't free
[09:33:28] <km4> taplar: show/hide I have, but I show body I need display body a few secends.
[09:33:46] <taplar> i'm not following
[09:33:54] <taplar> oh
[09:34:02] <openstandards> does anyone have experience using velocity with jquery?
[09:34:02] <taplar> like a delayed show/hide?
[09:34:50] <TickedOffDev> I've dug myself into this hole seeing as I've already made minor changes to the site in the past and when it came to pay time they referred to my maintenance package that I charge for upkeep ect and somehow since it was minor and freelancing is just a side gig I accepted that :c
[09:34:51] <km4> yes
[09:35:17] <openstandards> what do you think of that library?
[09:35:19] <taplar> km4: you could probably use setTimeout
[09:35:22] <hellyeah> toggle(4000)
[09:36:29] <hellyeah> km4: if you are using toggleClass it will do addClass and removeClass respectively
[09:36:37] <hellyeah> you can use css transition may be
[09:37:54] <shibly> Hi
[09:37:55] <km4> if I use setTimeout my body go mad
[09:38:17] <taplar> what do u mean?
[09:38:26] <km4> if I have in the body any link or button I cant click him
[09:39:18] <km4> setTimeout no clear
[09:39:36] <hellyeah> i guess i will need cordinates after all
[09:39:37] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/vq8kfxu4/1/
[09:39:44] <hellyeah> brb
[09:39:47] <km4> but how can use settimeout and cleat if I have mousover and mouseout
[09:40:18] <taplar> a better solution though would probably be to make the body a child of the 'button' so that hovering over the body is still considered a hover over the button
[09:40:53] <taplar> then you don't have to do anything fancy other than .button:hover .body { display: block; }
[09:43:17] <km4> taplar: I have this code. Look if you change timer 5000 in 500 and all time mouseover and mouseout in button this body go mad.
[09:43:35] <TickedOffDev> you can store the timeout in a variable and cleartimeout on mouseenter. You then rebind it on mouseleave
[09:43:48] <taplar> ^
[09:45:46] <km4> anyone use backbone and underscore ?
[09:45:58] <km4> can I normal make variables?
[09:47:18] <taplar> what do you mean?
[09:51:22] <km4> where I can past my varialbe in backbone. In render ?
[09:51:54] <jquery283> hey guys, I need your urgent help
[09:52:28] <jquery283> I am trying to do a scrollTo on a hybrid App. It does work on a Android but not on an bloody Iphone
[09:53:36] <Cork> jquery283: your prob better of asking in a channel for the app framework instead of here
[09:53:59] <Cork> that is web embedment specific questions and you are much more likely to get a good answer there
[09:54:01] <jquery283> its plane jquery though
[09:54:18] <Cork> ya, but the environemnt isn't a normal browser
[09:54:28] <jquery283> ok
[09:54:34] <jquery283> thanks
[09:54:38] <Cork> np
[09:56:16] <jquery283> @cork do you know the name of the channel or website link ??
[09:56:32] <Cork> what is the framework?
[09:56:41] <jquery283> ionic
[09:57:35] <Cork> #ionic
[09:57:41] <Cork> http://ionicframework.com/docs/ <-- footer
[10:06:56] <shibly> I have a question.
[10:07:19] <NoiseEee> the suspense is killing me
[10:10:12] <taplar> km4: here's an example of a pure css solution http://jsfiddle.net/vq8kfxu4/2/
[10:10:39] <hellyeah> hey
[10:10:54] <hellyeah> i can have data attirubte as much as i want write
[10:11:02] <taplar> sure
[10:11:07] <hellyeah> if i remember correctly data attr is flexible
[10:11:10] <hellyeah> data-*
[10:11:17] <hellyeah> thats nice
[10:21:47] <Uhkis> its really nice feature
[10:26:18] * hellyeah wondering jquery is an event for taking two objects into another place if there is a collision.
[10:26:59] <hellyeah> \mSg: are you bot?
[10:28:44] <taplar> nick taplar_afk
[10:28:54] <hellyeah> eheh
[10:28:56] <hellyeah> xD
[12:18:38] <blitz-_> If you have a bunch of div's with say class "example", all with display "none" except for one. How do i get the index of the visible one?
[12:19:14] <robertmaxrees> could get the visible one using .filter() or .is()
[12:19:46] <blitz-_> I tried $('.example').filter(':visible').index() but dont get the correct one.
[12:20:43] <taplar> mmm, there is only one from the filter results, so it's index would be 0
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:20:53] <taplar> no?
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> it'd be its index relative to its siblings.
[12:21:10] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x24odwe3/
[12:21:17] <robertmaxrees> you should get "3" for that.
[12:21:28] <taplar> ah
[12:21:30] <robertmaxrees> blitz-_ are all of these divs siblings of one another?
[12:22:41] <distrodan> im doing some JS/jquery for a site im making, completely new to it though D: I want to change the CSS depending on the screen width, with JS it would be if(screen.width<XXX) etc, and with jquery I see you can write $(window).width() which apparently works better, but how do you use it?
[12:22:55] <taplar> use media queries
[12:22:57] <distrodan> do you write it like: if($(window).width()) ?
[12:22:58] <robertmaxrees> distrodan not with javascript.
[12:23:00] <robertmaxrees> use css.
[12:23:22] <distrodan> taplar were you saying that to me?
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> distrodan yes they were.
[12:23:30] <distrodan> CSS media queries?
[12:23:32] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS%2FMedia_queries
[12:23:33] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:24:01] <robertmaxrees> blitz-_ make a fiddle or something.
[12:24:13] <distrodan> alright thanks :D will they update if the browser is resized?
[12:24:22] <robertmaxrees> distrodan yes.
[12:24:25] <taplar> they will apply on window resize
[12:24:35] <distrodan> cheers
[12:26:27] <taplar> firefox and chrome both have responsive web design view developer tools for testing that sorta stuff too fwiw
[12:33:11] <shibly> enctype: 'multipart/form-data', , is it valid with $.ajax() ?
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> shibly http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5392344/sending-multipart-formdata-with-jquery-ajax
[13:11:39] <tona> where can i download the last version from jquery :)
[13:12:06] <taplar> jquery.com?
[13:12:23] <tona> yes i know , but which is the last version
[13:12:40] <taplar> do you need older ie support?
[13:13:05] <tona> i mean the new version jquery
[13:13:16] <taplar> ?
[13:13:36] <tona> tih is the last version Download the compressed, production jQuery 1.11.3
[13:13:41] <tona> ?
[13:14:04] <taplar> yep, not counting the pre-release build
[13:14:12] <taplar> that is the one that includes older ie support too
[13:14:17] <taplar> the 2.x version does not
[13:19:33] <shibly> file_form.php => https://bpaste.net/show/5518f8ceddd7 , upload_script => https://bpaste.net/show/c1213dab4ffc , why is $_FILES empty array?
[13:20:07] <shibly> HOw can i get $_FILES informations?
[13:20:46] <taplar> you have to put the file object on your ajax with a Form thing, hold on
[13:21:52] <taplar> a FormData element
[13:22:47] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/484nefdu/
[13:23:39] <taplar> and your ajax has to have processData: false  and contentType: false
[13:23:48] <taplar> iirc
[13:24:59] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5392344/sending-multipart-formdata-with-jquery-ajax
[13:26:20] <tona> when i click on button , it doesnt show me anything , i just waiting one alert but it doesnt work , here is my code http://pastebin.com/eUk4ptBt any advice wll be great :) ?
[13:27:16] <taplar> your load function is defined after the html
[13:27:19] <shibly> I will be back tomorrow.
[13:27:25] <shibly> What does prop do?
[13:27:37] <taplar> accesses a dom's property
[13:27:44] <taplar> getter/setter
[13:28:24] <taplar> tona: you should do your bindings in your javascript also to separate your logic from your markup
[13:33:05] <tona> taplar what do you mean  ?
[13:33:44] <taplar> instead of using onclick in your html, bind your events in javascript using on() or addEventListener (if your doing vanilla js)
[13:34:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:34:41] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:43:56] <taplar> also you might should consider a dialog instead of an alert()
[13:44:52] <taplar> or just a simple console.log if your just trying to get debug info
[13:46:09] <neredsenvy> Is there some new feature in jquery autoloaded maybe that automatically changes the value of checkbox elements ?
[13:46:31] <robertmaxrees> "jquery autoloaded"?
[13:46:38] <neredsenvy> not sure damn it
[13:46:43] <taplar> what are you seeing?
[13:47:05] <neredsenvy> for some reason toggling checkbox element changes my predefined value to 1 when cehcked and 0 when unchecked
[13:47:27] <robertmaxrees> what is "jquery autoloaded" neredsenvy
[13:49:32] <robertmaxrees> www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/im_invisable_duck_dynasty.gif
[13:49:54] <taplar> heh
[13:52:56] <taplar> gah, i'm having trouble finding it.  wasn't it in the coneheads that had the guy that did the whole, "THINK.......TREE!!!"
[13:59:28] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[14:15:19] <HeatherWW> hi
[14:16:33] <taplar> hola
[14:17:46] <lc23> Does anyone know if you can add new colums  to a  sharepoint  list with new ListItem.set_item as well as the value to match ?
[14:27:07] <ABM_Dan> Hey, I'm trying to develop my first plugin, I even tried with a simple hello world template, but whenever I drop it in the .js file, I end up getting a "TypeError: $(...) is not a function" message.
[14:27:59] <Uhkis> load jquery before your js file
[14:28:43] <ABM_Dan> I do, the rest of the file uses jquery just fine
[14:28:58] <ABM_Dan> but if I append to the end of it it doesn't work.
[14:29:24] <ABM_Dan> It's a simple (function($) { $.fn.helloWorld = function() {}}(jQuery));
[14:31:56] <ABM_Dan> Hm, solved by throwing an extra $ at the beginning of it.
[14:45:43] <BillCriswell> What do you mean extra $ at the beginning of it?
[14:45:57] <ABM_Dan> $(function($) { $.fn.helloWorld = function() {}}(jQuery));
[14:48:13] <BillCriswell> Hm, doesn't make a lot of sense that doing that would allow it to work. What if you put a ; instead of a $ there?
[14:48:44] <BillCriswell> Wrapping it in $ defeats the purpose of the closure.
[14:49:22] <ABM_Dan> That's the only way I could make it work.
[15:07:13] <HeatherWW> anyone know how to hide this     http://jsfiddle.net/c37L5u23/
[15:18:05] <BillCriswell> HeatherWW: Your javascript is invalid and the selector isn't right.
[15:18:48] <BillCriswell> .aaa.bbb would look for <div class="aaa bbb">, not <div class="aaa" id="bbb">.
[15:20:32] <BillCriswell> If you want to select id="bbb" you'd use #bbb.
[15:20:43] <BillCriswell> Your script would end up looking like this: http://jsfiddle.net/crswll/c37L5u23/4/
[15:31:56] <ABM_Dan> In a success callback from .ajax i have this success: function(data){ if (typeof options.onAjaxSuccess == 'function') { options.onAjaxSuccess.call(this); } } how do I make it so that the callback can access the ajax data?
[15:32:45] <taplar> pass it in?
[15:32:51] <taplar> your already passing it in
[15:32:56] <ABM_Dan> ... how?
[15:32:57] <taplar> pass it on down
[15:33:12] <taplar> success: function(data){} <-- your passing in data
[15:33:53] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FFunction%2Fcall
[15:34:40] <ABM_Dan> $.fn.plugin.defaults = { onAjaxSuccess: function(data) { console.log(data); } };
[15:34:43] <ABM_Dan> data is undefined here.
[15:35:19] <taplar> how are you calling it?
[15:35:41] <ABM_Dan> options.onAjaxSuccess.call(this);
[15:36:17] <taplar> what do you get if you console.log(this); immediately before hand?
[15:37:05] <claytonzaugg> Does anyone have any idea what channel I could ask questions about Google Analytics?
[15:37:18] <ABM_Dan> Oh, this.data has the stuff.
[15:38:38] <ABM_Dan> no wait.
[15:38:44] <ABM_Dan> this IS data.
[15:38:45] <ABM_Dan> Whoa.
[15:39:48] <taplar> 'this' inside the onAjaxSuccess is the data?
[15:39:53] <ABM_Dan> But now I lost the scope of the jquery element that started it all.
[15:39:55] <ABM_Dan> Yes, it is.
[15:40:03] <taplar> so your calling the call() in correctly
[15:40:23] <taplar> *incorrectly
[15:40:42] <tona> hi everyone
[15:40:45] <ABM_Dan> I have no idea how to do it correctly, I'm playing mostly by ear.
[15:40:59] <taplar> ABM_Dan: got a fiddle?  that could help us see what you are trying
[15:41:13] <tona> i am not able to show alert (2)  on this code http://pastebin.com/Ri5sFfCn, could someone guide me please :)
[15:41:35] <ABM_Dan> I tried setting one up but I couldn't get the echo service to work and got frustrated.
[15:41:56] <taplar> ABM_Dan: that's fine, just seeing the logic can be informative
[15:42:08] <ABM_Dan> Gonna try setting it back up.
[15:42:26] <taplar> tona: is your first alert firing?
[15:43:04] <tona> yes the first alert fire but not the second one
[15:43:15] <taplar> check your console and see if there are any errors
[15:43:35] <taplar> you got a trailing ',' on ln 12 i don't know if it causing you an error or not
[15:45:05] <tona> i have modified it taplar and still the same
[15:45:22] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/yxgh4bsw/
[15:47:31] <taplar> which one of those is firing?
[15:47:41] <ABM_Dan> at the moment? none.
[15:48:16] <tona> alert 1 is firing
[15:48:18] <taplar> none of your options.on* calls are firing on your non-jsfiddle work?
[15:48:24] <ABM_Dan> In line 32, adding "jsmsg.error = 'Everyone panic'!"
[15:48:40] <ABM_Dan> in my nonjsfiddle the error is firing (correctly)
[15:48:47] <tona> it is firing $("#btnSubmit").click(function(){ 			alert("Alert"); but no the second one
[15:48:48] <ABM_Dan> it's just the parameters
[15:48:53] <ABM_Dan> I'm lost in scoping stuff.
[15:48:56] <taplar> k
[15:49:14] <ABM_Dan> line 23 sorry
[15:49:16] <taplar> console.log(this) on line 45, before you make that call
[15:50:20] <ABM_Dan> ok
[15:50:23] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/yxgh4bsw/1/
[15:50:29] <ABM_Dan> should be a decent simulation.
[15:50:31] <taplar> tona: and your console shows no errors?
[15:51:07] <tona> i am testing it on firefox
[15:51:26] <ABM_Dan> It's not the ajax error, it's the ajax success with a content containing error in the message.
[15:51:41] <ABM_Dan> basically I'm matching ajaxmessage.error
[15:52:03] <ABM_Dan> but again, the last fiddle works as the real version
[15:52:22] <taplar> ABM_Dan: ok, i'm -pretty- sure you just need to change your call() functions to be (this, jsmsg)
[15:52:31] <taplar> like the docs are showing
[15:52:59] <HeatherWW> Thanks BILL CRISWALL
[15:53:04] <taplar> call(contextObject[, param1[,param2[,...]]])
[15:53:09] * HeatherWW slaps BillCriswell around a bit with a large fishbot
[15:53:31] <taplar> tona: firefox has a console...
[15:53:37] <BillCriswell> You're welcome, Heather WW!
[15:53:51] <ABM_Dan> Works now.
[15:53:57] <tona> taplar yes but no show me no error
[15:53:59] <ABM_Dan> Thank you very much taplar.
[15:54:04] <taplar> ABM_Dan: np
[15:54:17] <taplar> hmm
[15:55:32] <taplar> tona: http://jsfiddle.net/npxchmyy/
[15:55:47] <taplar> took out the button thing so it would fire immediately
[15:56:25] <tona> taplar yes you are right it is telling me server is unavailable but why if www.google.com is the url right
[15:57:35] <HeatherWW> Hey Bill, what If i wanted to hide that div with query with a ddisplay: none;
[15:57:52] <HeatherWW> more of a css
[15:57:57] <HeatherWW> but using query
[15:57:59] <HeatherWW> on demand
[15:58:54] <ABM_Dan> btw, ended up passing (el, jsmsg), but you helped a lot in my understanding of the thing :)
[15:59:46] <HeatherWW> looks like:   bbb.style.display = "none";
[15:59:47] <HeatherWW> worked
[15:59:53] <HeatherWW> is that jsfiddle
[16:00:04] <HeatherWW> http://jsfiddle.net/c37L5u23/5/
[16:00:12] <taplar> tona: oh, well on the fiddle it's getting a CORS error
[16:00:30] <taplar> so that may be what your hitting
[16:02:20] <taplar> HeatherWW: hide() does the display: none for you
[16:02:26] <taplar> it's just a wrapper
[16:02:47] <BillCriswell> @HeatherWW You can do .css('display', 'none'), but hide() does that for you. Ideally you should be toggling a class though.
[16:03:30] <tona> taplar but why shoe me the alert with fail and not sucess , how should go the url typed
[16:03:59] <taplar> because your getting a cors most likely.  your trying to do an ajax request to another domain other than the one the ajax request originates from
[16:04:18] <taplar> it's a security mechanism
[16:05:46] <taplar> random google for a little reading: http://dev.housetrip.com/2014/04/17/unleash-your-ajax-requests-with-cors/
[16:05:58] <taplar> i'm out for the day.  later all
[16:06:14] <robertmaxrees> tona long story short, your browser and the other server are protecting you from a potentially unsafe operation.
[17:44:19] <hassoon> if i prepare a jquery event handler being  $(".ajout_rs_a").click(function(){alert 'hey';}); , then in the same page being worked on, an element (<a>) having the same class 'ajout_rs_a' is added dynamically with an ajax call, why when i click on it, i don't get the 'hey' alert, while clicking on the other <a> elements having the class 'ajout_rs_a' triggers the 'hey' alert
[17:44:49] <robertmaxrees> you can only bind to something that exists at the time you make the binding.
[17:45:18] <robertmaxrees> the binding can't "update" to include the new one.
[17:45:23] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[17:47:39] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: ah
[17:47:47] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: thank you will look that up
[17:47:49] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:47:54] <robertmaxrees> please read thge entire section.
[17:47:59] <robertmaxrees> the second example is the one your care about.
[17:48:01] <robertmaxrees> not the first.
[17:48:13] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: alright thanks
[17:48:15] <robertmaxrees> just using .on() does NOT fix this for you :)
[17:50:17] <HeatherWW> can someone see how you can set the current bread crumb to another color?      http://codepen.io/anon/pen/adbOLO?editors=110
[17:50:35] <robertmaxrees> HeatherWW as in #css :)
[17:51:06] <thinkxl> that nesting
[18:12:52] <adv_> anyone can recommend a lib for long click on mobile devices?
[18:13:10] <robertmaxrees> are you already using jquery mobile?
[18:15:29] <adv_> robertmaxrees: no
[18:20:20] <adv_> robertmaxrees: should i?
[18:20:37] <robertmaxrees> no point in bringing the whole framework in for one vent.
[18:20:39] <robertmaxrees> *event
[18:20:45] <robertmaxrees> use timeouts.
[18:21:22] <adv_> actually i want to show a dropdown menu on long click
[18:21:32] <robertmaxrees> right, so you'd use a timeout for that.
[18:21:46] <robertmaxrees> something like http://stackoverflow.com/a/2625240/923919
[18:24:17] <adv_> robertmaxrees: i don't know how to do the ui of the dropdown
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what you mean.
[18:24:52] <robertmaxrees> you starte dby asking about recognizing long press.
[18:25:46] <adv_> yes but then the 2nd question is how to present the options
[18:26:04] <robertmaxrees> dunno - that's better suited to a design channel :)
[18:27:17] <adv_> what's the appropriate jquery-mobile widget for this?
[18:27:34] <robertmaxrees> if you're not already using jquery mobile, don't bring in the entire framework.
[18:27:39] <robertmaxrees> that's really heavy and excessive.
[18:29:31] <adv_> robertmaxrees: yeah then i thought that maybe i need it for the ui
[18:29:38] <adv_> that's why i'm asking
[18:29:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:30:00] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for inspiration for mobile navigations?
[18:31:25] <adv_> no, i'm asking for a pragmatic way to implement a menu upon a long press
[18:31:35] <adv_> implement showing*
[18:31:46] <robertmaxrees> the link i showed you is one way.
[18:31:56] <adv_> for the long press ok
[18:31:59] <robertmaxrees> though generally we avoid long press for menus.
[18:32:14] <adv_> what is the recommended way?
[18:32:20] <robertmaxrees> just a normal tap.
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> or cop the facebook setup.
[18:32:50] <adv_> what's the fb setup?
[18:32:59] <robertmaxrees> have you used their app or mobile site?
[18:33:05] <adv_> no
[18:34:19] <robertmaxrees> quick google search will get you results like http://mobilemarketingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Facebook-screenshot-Jan-2015.png
[18:34:51] <robertmaxrees> so you have a hamburger icon for "more options" with the most commonly-used actions available in that top area.
[18:46:13] <samwisebumhug> hey folks. not quite sure what Im trying to ask, so bare with me. I'm setting up some pinterest API stuff, and I'd like to do it all from the same page by adding a listener that will take the token I get with my redirect_uri. How would one go about selecting / handling that data?
[18:47:03] <robertmaxrees> need more details :)
[18:47:14] <samwisebumhug> what can I tell you?
[18:47:22] <robertmaxrees> are you using ajax?
[18:47:25] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[18:47:25] <samwisebumhug> yessir
[18:47:29] <samwisebumhug> just a tic
[18:48:42] <robertmaxrees> and what is "the token i get with my redirect_ui"?  is that apart of your response?
[18:49:49] <samwisebumhug> yes - I mean to describe the (assumed) token sent back when your redirect is initiated
[18:50:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, something here isn't making sense.
[18:50:08] <samwisebumhug> http://pastie.org/10605148
[18:50:11] <robertmaxrees> what redirect?
[18:50:44] <samwisebumhug> okay. so you send a request with your app id and secret, they prompt user for auth, then once the user accepts - they send them back through your redir URI
[18:50:49] <robertmaxrees> none of these functions are getting called.
[18:50:55] <samwisebumhug> with that URI you're supposed to get an access_token
[18:51:12] <samwisebumhug> sure they are.
[18:51:27] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where initPull is getting pulled in that code.
[18:51:29] <samwisebumhug> I have a button calling getToken
[18:51:34] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:51:35] <samwisebumhug> its not yet
[18:51:40] <robertmaxrees> so describe the workflow here then.
[18:51:46] <samwisebumhug> okay, sorry. let me be clearer.
[18:52:01] <arc_> web design tips with arc: if you are going to auto-progress the cursor to the next field when the user has typed the maximum number of characters (like a date field) then disable tab from working for a moment after automatically moving the cursor
[18:52:39] <samwisebumhug> oh, I see your confusion - Id been screwing around with it so it's not "functional" at the moment what I pasted
[18:52:54] <robertmaxrees> samwisebumhug so clarify what's supposed to happen.
[18:52:55] <samwisebumhug> but you start with the #init.click() which then calls get token
[18:53:18] <robertmaxrees> ok
[18:53:33] <samwisebumhug> initpull is what Im trying to sort out
[18:53:42] <robertmaxrees> what about it are you trying to sort?
[18:53:43] <samwisebumhug> I want initpull to listen for the token when the user comes back
[18:53:58] <robertmaxrees> what token?  what do you mean "come bacK"?
[18:54:33] <robertmaxrees> i see a place you set token within getToken, but what do you mean "Come back"?  you mean like hitting the back button after visiting another page?
[18:55:00] <samwisebumhug> http://pastie.org/10605150
[18:55:17] <samwisebumhug> so what we're looking at is a .js apart from the index.php
[18:55:41] <samwisebumhug> the init.click and gettoken send the user to oath for permission
[18:55:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:55:59] <samwisebumhug> when oauth sends em back (using my specified URI) it sends them back with a string in the header
[18:56:06] <samwisebumhug> that string is the "token" Im on about
[18:56:20] <robertmaxrees> so the user goes to another page then comes back.
[18:56:23] <samwisebumhug> I know it's labeled "access_token" in "responseText"
[18:56:27] <samwisebumhug> exactly
[18:56:36] <robertmaxrees> so this isn't done via ajax.
[18:56:42] <samwisebumhug> not this part, no
[18:56:48] <samwisebumhug> cant - user has to click yes
[18:56:53] <robertmaxrees> then you get that token server-side.
[18:57:09] <samwisebumhug> lol well, its sending it - I can see it in dev tools when I get send back thru the URI
[18:57:16] <samwisebumhug> Im just unable to figure out how to select it
[18:57:18] <robertmaxrees> what URI?
[18:57:23] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're conflating something here.
[18:57:29] <samwisebumhug> possibly.
[18:58:11] <samwisebumhug> let me start over. I think what I need to do is create a listener so that when the page loads it checks if the header has a string in it labeled "access_token"
[18:58:31] <robertmaxrees> which you cannot do.
[18:58:37] <samwisebumhug> ah. well, that answers my question :D
[18:58:42] <robertmaxrees> javascript cannot access that.  your server needs to expose that information for you.
[18:58:51] <samwisebumhug> gotcha.
[18:58:58] <robertmaxrees> unless you're using ajax.
[18:59:01] <robertmaxrees> but in this case, you're not.
[18:59:14] <samwisebumhug> (to your knowledge - can you ajax this part of the oauth process?)
[18:59:44] <samwisebumhug> so then - Id need to build a listener in serverside stuff and pass it along as needed?
[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> http://alexbilbie.com/2014/11/oauth-and-javascript/
[19:00:23] <samwisebumhug> hmmm. yeah. thats kind of what I'd wanted to do originally but hten thought maybe it could be done all in JS
[19:00:42] <samwisebumhug> well, thanks for the help robertmaxrees - that pretty much answers my question
[19:00:42] <robertmaxrees> that very article tells you to proxy through your server, and with good reason :)
[19:06:11] <samwisebumhug> anyone else ever feel high after eating?
[19:06:16] <samwisebumhug> whoops. wrong window.
[19:06:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:06:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[19:06:23] <samwisebumhug> haha
[19:10:14] <arc_> so he leaves
[19:11:07] <robertmaxrees> welp
[19:49:52] <ashgotti> Hello everyone. Is there an even that I can use for a select field and a text input field? Change doesn't seem to work for input and input doesn't work for the select.
[19:50:10] <robertmaxrees> change works for both.
[19:50:31] <robertmaxrees> change fires for text fields after they lose focus but only if the value changed.
[19:51:10] <joao> Im trying to add row to a table with a delay() or wait(), dont know how to do it yet
[19:51:16] <joao> can anyone give me a hand? https://gist.github.com/converge/544bfe57eb67dc156ccf
[19:51:18] <ashgotti> Ok I should add hte input field is a date popup field so it doesnt' seem to work with that
[19:51:38] <robertmaxrees> joao there's no jquery wait - you want to use a native settimeout i'm getting.
[19:51:46] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti huh?
[19:52:13] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: It's an text-input field that is used for date input. When the user clicks it, a date popup opens
[19:52:21] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:52:25] <joao> robertmaxrees: is wait() the right function to use here ?
[19:52:29] <robertmaxrees> then use a callback for that.
[19:52:35] <robertmaxrees> joao no.  you want settimeout.
[19:52:37] <ashgotti> Change doesn't seem to have the same affect for that
[19:52:50] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti correct, becuase you need to use a callback provided by thelibrary.
[19:53:16] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: Can I use that in one jquery call including the select or I guess I"ll need two lines now.
[19:53:43] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti i have no way of knowing without knowing what you're using for the date input
[19:54:26] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: thanks for the help. I meant I can just use one $(document).on('change', '.field')
[19:54:33] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti probably not.
[19:54:36] <ashgotti> *can't
[19:54:42] <ashgotti> Ok, as always much appreciated
[19:56:20] <joao> setTimeout( $('#dynamic_logs tbody:last').after(logs) , 2000); anyone knows why this error here ? SyntaxError: missing ] after element list
[19:57:35] <robertmaxrees> because it expects a function as the first argument/.
[19:58:09] <robertmaxrees> $('#dynamic_logs tbody:last').after(logs) doesn't return a function, so that's part of your problem.
[19:58:26] <joao> create a function for it doesnt look good
[19:58:50] <robertmaxrees> you can create a named function and call that instea.d
[21:02:30] <pugtor> Hey guys, using this as a base: http://jsfiddle.net/kasperfish/r7MN9/4/ how exactly could I make the value of the options something specific? So "Mercedes" would be <option value="mecedes-benz">Mercedes</option>, etc.
[21:24:22] <shoky_> pugtor: since you're just building the option as an html string, you can just put the value there in the html
[21:24:54] <pugtor> Eh? I need each option to have a unique value tied to the actual option?
[21:25:08] <shoky_> pugtor: huh? isn't that what you asked for
[21:25:25] <shoky_> your data doesn't have the values tho..
[21:25:38] <shoky_> anyways.. here's one way  http://jsfiddle.net/r7MN9/1621/
[21:26:16] <pugtor> I know... I'm wondering how I can essentially make "Mercedes" have the value of "mercedes-benz", "Volvo" have the value of "foobar", etc.
[21:26:18] <pugtor> thanks for the link
[21:26:38] <shoky_> yes. that's having each option have a unique value tied to the option..
[21:26:56] <shoky_> well, doesn't have to be unique
[21:27:10] <pugtor> I think your example will work great. :
[21:27:11] <pugtor> :)
[21:27:16] <shoky_> sweet
[21:44:28] <noahmg123> I attempted a local file ajax and I got an error the cross origin requests are not available on the file protocol, but I was trying to get a file from the same folder.
[21:54:58] <Mark_____> another noob question: does anyone know why the arrow button disappears when i click on the title button here on this webpage? itâs a fullpage jquery plugin. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/project#firstPage
[22:05:53] <shoky_> title button?
[22:07:36] <shoky_> noahmg123 ajax is for communicating with a server. not to get a local file
[22:08:00] <noahmg123> shoky_: is there another way or would I have to put the files on a server?
[22:09:20] <pugtor> shoky_: I've expanded your example to include a third drop-down that changes based on what the second drop-down is. I'm sure chaining things like this isn't the best approach... http://jsfiddle.net/pt85mod3/
[22:09:47] <pugtor> but I'm wondering if there's a way to have a default value and/or completely reset both "child" drop-downs if the #model drop-down is changed...
[22:10:35] <pugtor> I tried putting a default value in the #region html but it doesn't seem to care if there's html there. I guess yea, I really need it to reset both child drop-downs to a default state if the #model drop-down is changed.
[22:12:56] <shoky_> noahmg123 don't think there's a good cross-browser way to do it from the file system.. and that's a good thing ;)
[22:13:33] <noahmg123> shoky_: well it's for my own local use but I see now why it is not easy.
[22:14:16] <shoky_> noahmg123: if its for your own local use there are browser flags you can use to turn those security features off, usually
[22:18:13] <shoky_> pugtor: why not just call populateSelectRegion() from inside populateSelect ?
[22:18:18] <shoky_> at the end
[22:18:58] <shibly> Object { 0: <form>, context: <form>, length: 1 } , is this array or other?
[22:19:12] <shibly> How can i get the first value of Object?
[22:19:22] <shoky_> shibly it's an object that is array-like
[22:19:29] <shoky_> looks like a jquery object
[22:19:36] <shibly> Isn't array like [] ?
[22:19:53] <shoky_> it's like an array in that it has a .length and it has indexed properties
[22:20:08] <shibly> How can i get the first value of Object?
[22:20:25] <shoky_> [0] will get the element
[22:21:15] <pugtor> hmm, seems like that works. One lasssst question for now. the  #model option "GFS" and "GFS-Ensemble" (and potentially others) will have the same #plot option(s) and #region options(s) is there anyway to somehow not reset the child drop-down if they contain the same options?
[22:22:33] <pugtor> I know we're .change'ing the dropdowns on #model change so I'm just curious.
[22:23:04] <shoky_> pugtor you can either set both of those properties to point to the same object instance, and then on change, check if the old one and new one are equal with ===
[22:23:19] <pugtor> yea that's going way over my head. blah
[22:23:21] <shoky_> but that will change how your raw data looks a bit
[22:23:28] <shibly> console.log($(this).0); to get the first value of Object, i get SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list , why?
[22:23:51] <shoky_> or... you can compare the prev and new options, and decide based on that. not too nice either
[22:24:01] <shibly> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp , accesing object: objectName.propertyName
[22:24:06] <shibly> shoky_: ?^
[22:24:09] <shoky_> shibly  you can't use numbers with . access
[22:24:13] <shoky_> [0] will work
[22:24:21] <shoky_> $(this)[0]
[22:24:23] <shoky_> but./..
[22:24:27] <shoky_> that is the same as just  this
[22:24:29] <shoky_> ;p
[22:25:20] <shoky_> i.e. doing $(this)[0]  is plain wrong, unless it's just for experimentation/learning
[22:26:13] <shibly> shoky_: $(this)[0] is wrong?
[22:26:37] <shoky_> shibly: yes.  because that will always be "this"
[22:26:42] <shoky_> $(this)[0] === this
[22:26:56] <shibly> Object { 0: <form>, context: <form>, length: 1 } , $(this).context works
[22:27:03] <shoky_> btw don't use w3schools
[22:27:04] <shibly> $(this)[0] works
[22:27:31] <shoky_> just because it works doesn't mean it's not wrong
[22:27:40] <shoky_> there is absolutely no reason to ever do that
[22:27:56] <shoky_> just like tehre's no reason to do   [this][0]
[22:28:18] <shoky_> or  ['abcd'][0]
[22:28:28] <shoky_> all of those - wrong
[22:29:44] <shibly> shoky_: $(this)[0] is not wrong.
[22:29:50] <shoky_> shibly: it's wrong
[22:30:19] <shoky_> if there is never any situation where you should do it, it's wrong ;)
[22:32:48] <noahmg123> shoky_: I think I msy put the files on a server.
[22:33:33] <shoky_> noahmg123 that or like i said there are browser flags to turn security off, if it's important to you
[22:33:52] <noahmg123> shoky_: how can I do tht specifcally for chrome?
[22:34:40] <shoky_> noahmg123:  you call the chrome executable with a command line flag:   --disable-web-security
[22:35:01] <noahmg123> shoky_: ok, i may try that
[22:35:09] <shoky_> noahmg123  also you might need  -âallow-file-access-from-files
[22:35:15] <noahmg123> ok
[22:35:52] <shoky_> and you need to close all chrome processes before running with the flags, i think
[22:38:27] <shibly> shoky_: Then how would you access element of Object ?
[22:39:02] <shoky_> shibly:  instead of $(this)[0]  you just write:   this
[22:39:03] <shoky_> :)
[22:39:12] <shoky_> or if you're asking a different question, i don't understand it
[22:41:57] <shibly> shoky_: Are you telling me to use $(this) ?
[22:42:17] <shoky_> when did i say that?
[22:43:24] <shibly> shoky_: Oh, only "this", thank you

[23:07:21] <pugtor> shoky_: could you point me to somewhere to read about how to do the "set both of those properties to point to the same object instance, and then on change, check if the old one and new one are equal with ===" approach?
