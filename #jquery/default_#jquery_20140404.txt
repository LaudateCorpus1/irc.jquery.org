[00:01:51] <slax0r> typeof functionName === "function" determines if functionName is infact a function, but how would I check that var funcName = "functionName"; holds the name of the function?
[00:02:23] <systemfault> What?
[00:02:55] <systemfault> If you have an unamed function… then it’s unamed.
[00:03:20] <slax0r> who said it's unnamed?
[00:03:55] <slax0r> the function name can be dynamic, php provides the js function name, that I should then call when ajax completes
[00:04:07] <slax0r> so i have the functions name in a string, how can I check that this function exists before calling it?
[00:04:30] <systemfault> Is that function attached to some object?
[00:04:42] <systemfault> You’re not clear :(
[00:04:56] <slax0r> I'll make a fiddle
[00:05:10] <Uhkis> implement getName() or something?
[00:06:17] <slax0r> like this http://jsfiddle.net/Zcp4p/
[00:08:53] <Cork> slax0r: test
[00:08:54] <Cork> opps
[00:08:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Zcp4p/1/
[00:11:07] <slax0r> Cork: does the function have to be prepended with window.
[00:11:08] <slax0r> ?
[00:11:10] <ravenzz> better http://jsfiddle.net/Zcp4p/2/
[00:11:24] <Cork> slax0r: it needs to be appended to an object
[00:11:57] <Cork> ravenzz: that is basically the same thing though
[00:12:09] <ravenzz> well you can always change this to {}
[00:12:22] <ravenzz> no need to refactor everything
[00:12:37] <Cork> slax0r: but the question is most likely what are you trying to do?
[00:12:46] <Cork> slacko_: are you fiddling with jsonp?
[00:13:03] <slax0r> second solution doesn't work, because the function and the caller wont be in the same file
[00:13:41] <Cork> slax0r: it could still work
[00:13:46] <ravenzz> alright
[00:13:47] <Cork> slax0r: js isn't file based
[00:14:04] <Cork> slax0r: how it would be constructed depends on the context
[00:14:13] <Cork> something you haven't shared yet :)
[00:14:20] <slax0r> Cork: erm, when fancybox shows(afterShow callback) I read the initialization function name from the fancybox content and call it
[00:14:30] <ravenzz> slax0r in that case you may want to communicate through events
[00:14:55] <Cork> slax0r: where is the function defined?
[00:15:07] <Cork> or rather how is it defined
[00:15:45] <slax0r> Cork: I have an overlay.js file which contains this fancybox function and callingto init functions, init functions are then wirtten in profile.js, if profile is to be opened in an overlay
[00:15:58] <slax0r> defined as a normal JS function, function initProfile() {} i.e.
[00:16:13] <Cork> slax0r: "how" meaning are they defined globally?
[00:16:16] <Cork> are they in a scope
[00:16:24] <Cork> are they attached to some object somewhere
[00:16:26] <Cork> and so on
[00:16:47] <slax0r> at the moment they are not defined anywhere yet
[00:16:48] <Cork> like i said what js file they are defined in doesn't matter
[00:16:52] <slax0r> but I was thinking globally
[00:16:54] <ravenzz> slax0r which version of fancybox are you using?
[00:17:00] <slax0r> ravenzz: 2
[00:17:14] <Cork> slax0r: if they are defined globally you can check for them with window[name]
[00:17:25] <ravenzz> slax0r does it trigger custom events?
[00:17:35] <slax0r> ravenzz: no
[00:17:38] <ravenzz> Cork events is the best way to go imho
[00:17:55] <Cork> ravenzz: depends
[00:18:12] <Cork> the one adding the listener would have to know the selector for that to work
[00:18:22] <slax0r> ok, so, afterShow fires an fancyBoxCustomInit event i.e.
[00:18:25] <slax0r> how do I attach to it?
[00:18:35] <ravenzz> slax0r I would like to suggest that you trigger an event in the afterShow callback (eg fancyboxShown) and listen for that in the other file
[00:18:43] <ravenzz> see
[00:19:07] <ravenzz> Cork no if you rely on event bubbling
[00:19:13] <slax0r> ravenzz: I understand how event triggering and listening works, but how would I listen for that even?
[00:19:14] <ravenzz> attach it to the document
[00:19:32] <ravenzz> $(document).on('fancyboxShown', dosomething)
[00:19:49] <slax0r> come to think of it
[00:20:03] <slax0r> that wouldn't work, all files are then concatenated into one big all.js file
[00:20:10] <ravenzz> ..
[00:20:15] <slax0r> and then all event listeners would be executed
[00:20:21] <ravenzz> wat
[00:20:38] <ravenzz> ah you mean that it might trigger before you bind
[00:20:40] <ravenzz> mmm
[00:21:05] <ravenzz> what if you use a dependecy manager or write a tiny bootloader
[00:21:39] <slax0r> no, I have a .js file for each site, and if two or more files listen for afterShown event and all those files are concatenated into one, each listener will then be executed when the event fires
[00:22:51] <jphase> hey Cork, buddy, pal, CORS guru friend of mine.....
[00:22:52] <ravenzz> why would you bundle the two sites js ?
[00:23:18] <ravenzz> you should have a common_stuff.js and site_stuff.js
[00:23:51] <ravenzz> what do you need anothersite_stuff.js for
[00:24:22] <slax0r> ravenzz: didn't set it up...apparently makes for easier caching...
[00:24:32] <slax0r> I'm just fixing some unlogical stuff throughout
[00:25:29] <slax0r> anyway, don't have the time to change everything...I'm just going to go for function exists aproach
[00:25:30] <ravenzz> I am not going to waste my time trying to convince you that you should change it. If you don't want to or can't (for any reason) go for the global name thing
[00:25:34] <slax0r> kinda on a tight schedule
[00:25:38] <slax0r> thanks for your help
[00:25:41] <ravenzz> np
[00:26:21] <jphase> having a heck of a time getting some .load sorcery to work in IE < 11 on this damned salesforce template and am unable to figure out what the error is exactly   https://infinityrehab.secure.force.com/careers
[00:26:22] <slax0r> I do want to switch, but like I said, time is a limit factor atm
[00:26:41] <ravenzz> yeah I heard you np
[00:28:11] <jphase> oh on second thought, I might need to fix this silly company's lack of a doc type here...
[00:30:35] <jphase> dang, not the issue :(
[01:11:09] <fabioportieri> gooooood morning
[01:22:41] <CrowX-> Cork, are you there?
[01:23:44] <Cork> CrowX-: please just ask the question if you have one, don't ask for a person
[01:24:53] <ocx> hi all, i am trying the multipage jqm feature , clicking on home does not transition to the section page with id = home any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/rPK97/5/
[01:25:55] <ocx> think i forgot a div
[01:29:23] <CrowX-> if you remember the site I was working on yesterday http://whatishacking.org/, well I came to another issue, which was - since the image's container was set to full height, and then to zero before the image starts even loading, and as soon as that happens, the image's container starts opening in a slide-up motion revealing the image from top to buttom. Now, I have made the update of the height to last the moment before the image starts showing, but if the
[01:29:23] <CrowX->  image hasn't been loaded when a 'next' or a 'previous' click happens, the image would first be shown, and then its height would be set to static and the container reduced to 0
[01:29:27] <CrowX-> Cork, ^
[01:29:39] <CrowX-> er, the url was http://whatishacking.org/rach
[01:30:12] <CrowX-> so I put the 'button-next' in an onload event, which made things even weirder
[01:37:54] <DarsVaeda> I have "<figure><ul><li>...</li><footer><button>add li</button><figure>" and I want to append a li to the ul, what do I use to select it? $(this).parent().parent().append(), $('ul',$(this).next(figure)).append(), ...?
[01:39:08] <systemfault> o_O
[01:39:21] <systemfault> DarsVaeda: You don’t use classes in your code?
[01:39:23] <DarsVaeda> or maybe I'm doing something stupid ^^
[01:39:36] <DarsVaeda> yes sure
[01:39:43] <DarsVaeda> ul.answers
[01:39:46] <systemfault> What is the class on the figure?
[01:39:49] <Uhkis> CrowX-: argh, lose the thing that follows mouse :)
[01:40:03] <DarsVaeda> oh figure has no class actually
[01:40:12] <systemfault> $(‘ul.answers’).append(……)
[01:40:26] <DarsVaeda> yes but what if there are two ul? ;)
[01:40:46] <ocx> when i am transitioning to a new page the footer section is jumping up how can i make it fixed stay in the same place? http://jsfiddle.net/rZrqu/8/
[01:40:55] <DarsVaeda> I want that one in the figure the button is in too
[01:41:06] <systemfault> Ah
[01:41:34] <systemfault> Then in the event handler, this will represent the button, so you can do
[01:41:41] <ocx> ok data-position=fixed did it
[01:42:08] <systemfault> $(this).closest(‘figure’).find(‘.answers’).append(.....
[01:43:02] <DarsVaeda> right but I wonder if parent().parent() is better perfomance wise
[01:43:18] <DarsVaeda> and how expensive the closest and find thing is
[01:43:20] <systemfault> DarsVaeda: .parent().parent() is ugly fragile code
[01:44:07] <systemfault> Performance is irrelevant, what matters is maintainability
[01:44:26] <beancurd> DarsVaeda: closet is better performance wise.
[01:44:48] <DarsVaeda> okay
[01:44:51] <Uhkis> "Always code as if the person who will maintain your code is a maniac serial killer"
[01:45:11] <DarsVaeda> but what if I'm the maniac? :D
[01:45:22] <Uhkis> suicide..? dunno :D
[01:47:38] <CrowX-> if I define a click event handler at some place, and later defined another click event handler to the same element but enclosed in an 'on('load'" event of the element, will the normal click event work fine and get replaced by the onload defined one when its element is fully loaded?
[01:50:48] <Ventox> Hey everyone Im using Wordpress and the problem is that when I disable the plugin "NextGen" the sliders on the homepage doesnt work: http://talgerafi.com/elsev2/
[01:52:45] <Uhkis> Ventox: #wordpress
[01:53:25] <Ventox> Uhkis: maybe.. but its still a jquery question :\
[01:55:41] <Ventox> Nvm Fixed
[01:56:59] <drager> I'm trying to grab the values from inputs in an "modal"; http://jsbin.com/woxavego/1/ but I'm getting an empty string...
[01:57:46] <Uhkis> Ventox: actually it's wordpress plugin question
[01:58:19] <m4rtijn> hi, i remove all inline styles with jquery from my site - is there a possibilty to "skip" a container? -- like remove all except from #nothere
[01:59:08] <Cork> m4rtijn: what do you mean remove inline style?
[01:59:14] <Cork> removeAttr('style')?
[01:59:18] <m4rtijn> yes
[01:59:22] <Cork> ?api not
[01:59:22] <b-ot> Cork: .not(): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[01:59:39] <m4rtijn> thanks Cork
[02:26:12] <dwarder> i have a post form and it submits values, is there a way to hook to that submissions?
[02:26:27] <dwarder> i.e. do your own stuff when the form got sumbited
[02:42:52] <Leidenfrost> Hi all. Can someone give me a tip about why this doesn´t work? http://jsfiddle.net/4CdXf/
[02:43:45] <Leidenfrost> It should pop up a ¨Bien!¨ alert, but for some reason it doesn´t capture the event
[02:44:07] <ussher_> Leidenfrost: because you've got php mixed in there with it.
[02:44:58] <Leidenfrost> ussher_: thanks for you answer. But php is in another part of the document. Why would it interfer with jquery?
[02:45:40] <xec> Leidenfrost: there's also a ) missing
[02:45:48] <xec> Leidenfrost: do you get any errors on console?
[02:46:01] <ussher_> its unknown if its interfering with jquery or not, it certainly is intefering with the layout.  you have IF/ELSE syntax thats supposed to be evaluated being output as html.
[02:46:35] <ussher_> whenever you have things not working, check your base markup validates.
[02:46:58] <Jattenalle> ugh, never mix HTML, JS, and PHP like that :/
[02:47:08] <Jattenalle> it'll be completely impossible to maintain or expand on
[02:48:27] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: It´s my first project :) it was the best way I could think on.
[02:48:59] <Jattenalle> hehe, yeah i did the same thing in my first few PHP projects
[02:49:37] <xec> Leidenfrost: did you see my messages? it appears you're doing .click(... instead of .click(...)
[02:49:59] <Jattenalle> yeah, last few lines
[02:50:03] <Jattenalle> missing a )
[02:50:22] <Leidenfrost> yes, I facepalmed when saw the console. Thanks about that.
[02:50:25] <Jattenalle> it should close with }); not just };
[02:51:03] <drager> I'm trying to grab the values from inputs in an "modal"; http://jsbin.com/woxavego/1/ but I'm getting an empty string...
[02:51:11] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: And what do you suggest to make it better? (I don´t know how to say this without looking rude)
[02:51:39] <Jattenalle> well, the more you can separate things, the better
[02:51:51] <Jattenalle> having php in the middle of your html, or php that outputs html randomly
[02:51:58] <Jattenalle> is going to be horrible to work with after a while
[02:52:16] <xec> drager: what exactly is the code supposed to do?
[02:52:29] <Jattenalle> you should look into some kind of templating system (or write your own as an exercise
[02:53:09] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: Yes, I TRIED to create some sort of MVC hierarchy, but in the end I had to show things using php language.
[02:53:17] <drager> xec: Grab the values from the inputs and add them to textarea... Markdown popup for specify an URL
[02:53:34] <Jattenalle> Leidenfrost, don't worry, just keep at it :) practice makes perfect
[02:54:10] <xec> drager: ok. why do you have html in the script instead of just keeping the modal html in, well, the html source
[02:54:33] <xec> drager: i'm just trying to make sense of the script, sorry if my questions sound silly ;)
[02:54:45] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: Thanks :) I wonder if there´s a way to output html from the backend without resorting to random php tags
[02:55:01] <Jattenalle> Leidenfrost, you're already doing it, it's just a bit messy
[02:55:02] <Leidenfrost> I just did it because I once saw a joomla view file and it had lots of tags around it.
[02:55:06] <drager> xec: No problem, the clearer it is the better you can help me
[02:55:27] <Jattenalle> basically, you only want php in the php tags, and you want to abstract it as much as possible (templates! )
[02:56:03] <drager> xec: I have html there so I can use the modal for more than just "that"
[02:56:12] <drager> that im doing with it now
[02:57:07] <Jattenalle> Leidenfrost, make a template system (or finding one to use) can be a bit of a pain, and take a while to get ready.. but in the end it's so worth it
[02:57:13] <Jattenalle> when you can just add something easily and call it a day
[02:57:37] <Jattenalle> i mean, imagine, for example, that you change the name of one of your database tables
[02:57:40] <hxm> hello, i have this script http://edudominguez.es/dahomey-2/ which looks ok except the vertical images, using the parameters of the script i cant manage them
[02:57:42] <xec> drager: ok, you should really clean that up, keep html in one place and out of the script logic. that said, it shouldnt stop the script from working, what part is working and what is not?
[02:57:43] <Jattenalle> you'd need to edit every sourcefile that uses it
[02:57:49] <hxm> can i do something with this to make the vertical images to look ok?
[02:58:37] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: I see. I tried to learn CakePHP before, but it felt overwhelming due the given time for the project.
[02:58:37] <drager> xec: Everything works except putting the values from the inputs to my textarea
[02:58:45] <drager> xec: getting "an empty string"
[02:59:16] <Jattenalle> Leidenfrost, if it's just a one-time small project, it doesnt matter.. but for larger projects, you really want to think about code structure from the start.. or you'll have a bad time :)
[02:59:34] <Jattenalle> i speak from experience... horrible horrible experience...
[03:01:50] <xec> drager: what part of the code is that
[03:02:49] <ines> good morning
[03:02:52] <ines> every body
[03:03:25] <drager> xec: It's when I call the markdownInsert() in the on-click.
[03:04:57] <xec> drager: it seems to get the value from $inputEl.val(); correct?
[03:05:32] <xec> drager: and you have $inputEl = inputOne.appendTo($popupContentEl);
[03:06:03] <xec> drager: what is inputOne in this context?
[03:07:08] <xec> drager: and why don't you just do inputOne.val() ?
[03:07:36] <drager> xec: I declare inputOne at the top
[03:07:39] <drager> as you can see
[03:07:59] <xec> you mean it gets passed in as an argument
[03:08:09] <xec> yeah i see it
[03:08:49] <xec> this is all extremely complex for such a simple task
[03:09:10] <xec> drager: look, i made you this http://jsfiddle.net/ra8Us/1/
[03:09:32] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: lol got it :)
[03:12:31] <drager> xec: hm
[03:13:33] <xec> drager: anyway, to address your current issue, it appears $inputEl contains both the <label> and a <div> with the <input> inside
[03:14:02] <xec> drager: so the (ugly) quickfix is to do url = $inputEl.find("input").val();
[03:14:13] <drager> xec: Yeah, I just saw that :o
[03:15:00] <drager> thanks
[03:15:28] <xec> drager: but the real issue that the code structure is a mess, it's very hard to tell what it's doing. If you absolutely must have html in the script file, try to keep it in a single "template" variable for instance
[03:16:27] <drager> xec: Alright, will do. Thanks for help and input
[03:16:30] <xec> drager: and don't recreate the entire structure each time you click - have one initializaton phase where you add the elements to the dom, and then attach the appropriate event handlers once ;)
[03:17:26] <drager> xec: Hm
[03:20:17] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: And to get a good code structure do I need a framework? Or is there info online to get it right?
[03:20:44] <Jattenalle> Leidenfrost, it's mostly about separating and abstracting your code as much as possible
[03:20:46] <xec> drager: something like this is a bit cleaner: http://jsfiddle.net/ra8Us/2/
[03:20:53] <Jattenalle> but again, for a small project it doesnt matter much
[03:21:34] <drager> xec: alright, thanks
[03:36:52] <mdev> <input type="image" name="ctl00$MainContent$EligibilitySearchImageButton" id="ctl00_MainContent_EligibilitySearchImageButton"
[03:36:59] <mdev> it doesn't find
[03:37:16] <mdev> $('#ctl00_MainContent_EligibilitySearchImageButton')
[03:37:37] <Leidenfrost> Jattenalle: Ok. Thanks for the answer to my problem and the advice. Cheers.
[03:37:52] <mdev> tried looping with $('form input').each(function(i, v) to locate the name too with $(this).attr('name')
[03:37:57] <mdev> but it doesn't find that either
[03:38:06] <mdev> how do I get at this element
[03:38:08] <Cork> mdev: sounds like you prob search for it before it is added to the page or something like that
[03:38:28] <mdev> herm maybe
[03:39:33] <xec> oh god, i'm so happy i'm not working on any webforms projects anymore :(
[03:40:07] <mdev> nah it's there
[03:40:17] <mdev> I just saved the html ahead before checking
[03:40:32] <xec> well, the code you posted should work
[03:41:29] <xec> mdev: http://jsfiddle.net/FBfzv/
[03:43:53] <mdev> yeah I got it to work a .click() doesn't work i take it that's only for certain things? I tried a emulation mouse click thing too that's different and that didn't work but sending a virtual enter to it worked
[03:43:57] <mdev> very weird
[03:47:03] <xec> i have no idea what that means
[03:50:15] <mdev> it means it found the id
[03:50:24] <mdev> it just wasn't doing what I wanted previously
[03:50:31] <mdev> but now it is, so thanks, jquery ftw!
[03:54:18] <ines> haw can i submit multipart form on post?
[03:55:39] <ines> http://jsfiddle.net/aNHS2/
[03:55:53] <ines> i dont have my photo name?
[04:00:25] <xec> ines: the data option for $.ajax takes a js object or a string
[04:00:53] <xec> ines: you can use .serialize() to get a string off a form
[04:01:18] <xec> ines: i'm not sure how FormData() works
[04:24:26] <bristleback> hi
[04:27:18] <bristleback> on a page, in $(document).ready(), I set an event listner on all elements containing "static-action" class. later on, new elements are added on the page and I add again an event listner for all elements containing "static-action" class. What happens with the elements that were  initially on the page and that had the event already attached
[04:27:19] <bristleback> ?
[04:29:47] <Cork> bristleback: you will get duplicate event listeners
[04:30:01] <Cork> bristleback: use delegated event listeners, they are explicitly there for this
[04:30:29] <bristleback> delegate event listeners?
[04:30:31] <Cork> $('static common parent').on('event', '.static-action', function() {})
[04:30:45] <bristleback> let me search on jquery about those cause I don't know anything about them
[04:30:54] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:30:54] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:31:34] <bristleback> $('static common parent').on('event', '.static-action', function() {})  --> this is how I do it now
[04:31:44] <bristleback> why did you told me about it
[04:31:45] <bristleback> ?
[04:31:52] <bristleback> I see that delegate is different
[04:32:44] <Cork> bristleback: .on is a function added in 1.9
[04:32:51] <Cork> it is a combination of .bind and .delegate
[04:33:00] <Cork> depending on what arguments you pass it
[04:33:14] <Cork> .on('event', func) => .bind('event', func)
[04:33:33] <Cork> .on('event', 'selector', func) => .delegate('selector', 'event', func)
[04:41:43] <ocx> Hi Cork everytime i do href="index.html" the whole dom is reloaded? or cached?
[04:42:09] <Cork> if the page is without js, sure
[04:42:15] <Cork> if you have js, depends
[04:43:13] <beasty> morning Cork ! o/
[04:43:24] <ocx> so mainly non js is always reloaded
[04:43:25] <Cork> 'gafternoon
[04:43:33] <Cork> yes
[04:43:43] <Cork> js can catch the click and do something else
[04:43:54] <ocx> coz on my phonegap app when i am navigating from one page to another i see like a transition (white screen for a fraction of a second) but it shows that it is not native app
[04:44:36] <ocx> dunno if there is a way to avoid this quick blinking
[04:44:48] <ocx> on the desktop this does not happen btw
[04:46:35] <Cork> ocx: yes when you load a different site you are basically forced to allow the underlying app to blow the dom away
[04:46:39] <bristleback> Cork: thanks! it means I delegate the events
[04:46:48] <bristleback> one more thing if I may
[04:46:51] <Cork> ocx: and there isn't really much you can do about it
[04:47:17] <ocx> Cork: mainly i got a footer with different buttons each button when pressed takes you to a section #page of the multipage
[04:47:30] <ocx> so even with that having the whole dom loaded i see that blinking transition
[04:49:06] <Cork> ocx: might be jqm doesn't catch it or something
[04:49:28] <Cork> ocx: but ya, if you arn't loading it as partials in the current page you will get full page reloads
[04:49:37] <Cork> ?ask @ bristleback
[04:49:38] <b-ot> bristleback: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:49:48] <ocx> Cork: i am loading partially
[04:49:53] <bristleback> I'm using handlebars to append generate content that will be appended on the page. if I do something like var template = Handlebars.compile( $("static element").html() ); var content = template(data), where data is the object containing the information that will be added in the template, why I can't do something like $(content).find("selector")?
[04:50:02] <ocx> div page1 is loaded then href=#page2
[04:50:04] <Cork> ocx: not sure why you would get the white flash then
[04:50:10] <ocx> yea me too
[04:50:12] <Cork> but i don't know the platform your using
[04:50:36] <ocx> running on android 4.1
[04:50:45] <ocx> samsnung note2
[04:51:02] <Cork> ocx: i meant your using phonegap, and i have limited experience with it
[04:51:15] <ocx> yea phonegap uses webview thats all
[04:51:24] <CrowX-> in this example http://jsfiddle.net/836jc/ each time I click on the image, the function executes more times, presumably because the previous click events are still firing. How do I prevent this?
[04:51:41] <Cork> bristleback: template might not give you html or a dom element
[04:51:52] <Cork> bristleback: check what "content" is
[04:52:02] <Cork> bristleback: it should work if it is
[04:52:34] <Cork> CrowX-: don't bind the click handler in the load event
[04:53:01] <CrowX-> Cork, I have to
[04:53:07] <Cork> why?
[04:53:09] <bristleback> Cork: this is what content will be: http://jsfiddle.net/49tGy/
[04:53:31] <nights> how can i rewrite this in jquery
[04:53:31] <nights> document.getElementsByClassName('payment_tab').disabled = true;
[04:53:32] <nights> ?
[04:53:32] <Cork> bristleback: are you sure that is what template(data) returns?
[04:53:38] <CrowX-> Cork, in the real life code, the click event should only be possible when the image is fully loaded.
[04:53:51] <CrowX-> this is an isolated example
[04:53:55] <Cork> nights: $('.payment_tab').prop('disabled', true)
[04:54:27] <Cork> CrowX-: so set a variable and flip it to false/true
[04:54:36] <CrowX-> Cork, tried that first
[04:54:39] <CrowX-> didn't work
[04:54:44] <Cork> ...
[04:54:56] <Cork> "didn't work" is one of the most useless comments
[04:54:57] <CrowX-> Cork, because not every time the onload event was firing
[04:55:29] <Cork> sounds like you bind the load event after you set the src
[04:55:30] <CrowX-> Cork, the image's src was changing, but the load event wasn't firing
[04:55:52] <CrowX-> the load event was 'upper' in the code
[04:56:13] <Cork> CrowX-: well then you need to fix that part
[04:56:32] <Cork> CrowX-: cause how ever you look at it you will get problem if the click doesn't know when it should be possible
[04:56:45] <puchacz> hi, can any character be passed in hidden inputs? and the value, can it be any length?
[04:57:13] <CrowX-> Cork, btw, is there no solution in the way I have done it now? i.e. to prevent the earlier click events from firing?
[04:57:20] <puchacz> for example, properly encoded line ends
[04:57:27] <bristleback> Cork: yes. console.log(content) and var content = template(data);
[04:57:56] <Cork> CrowX-: there are a few very hacky ways around it
[04:58:09] <Cork> CrowX-: like $(selector).off('click')
[04:58:21] <Cork> and just hope you arn't killing something else in the process
[04:58:29] <Cork> but that is breaking code isolation
[04:58:40] <Cork> and means that this code has to know about all other codes on the page
[04:58:44] <nights> Thanks Mr Cork
[04:58:44] <Cork> so it doesn't break them
[04:59:02] <nights> IE8 didnt support
[04:59:02] <nights> document.getElementsByClassName('payment_tab').disabled = true;
[04:59:02] <Cork> bristleback: what are you doing with .find() ?
[04:59:30] <Cork> nights: ya, you use... document.all there if i remember correctly
[04:59:47] <Cork> man i don't remember the old jscript dom junk anymore (yay)
[05:00:43] <bristleback> Cork: well, before asking you and using Handlebars, what I wasn't actually generating the content, but had it hard coded and attach it to the dom, smth like var content = $('<li>....</li>');
[05:01:33] <bristleback> Cork: after appending it on the page, I was doing smth like $(content).find(".static-action").on("click", function() {})
[05:01:42] <Cork> ah
[05:01:50] <Cork> bristleback: there is your problem
[05:01:56] <bristleback> Cork: that was made in order to avoid adding duplicate events
[05:01:57] <Cork> bristleback: content is html
[05:02:01] <Cork> html can't hold event listeners
[05:02:07] <bristleback> ok
[05:02:16] <Cork> $(content) will actually parse the html to dom every time it runs
[05:02:27] <bristleback> Cork: but even if I do $(content) won't work?
[05:02:33] <Cork> so you do $(content).find().on() binds an event listener
[05:02:44] <Cork> and as nothing holds onto the new dom it gets destroied
[05:03:07] <Cork> bristleback: so what you need to do is parse the html to dom, and keep THAT
[05:03:22] <bristleback> Cork: and how do I do that?
[05:03:27] <Cork> var elms = $(content); elms.find().on() ... $().append(elms)
[05:04:00] <Cork> bristleback: also depending on the situation, you might want to use delegated event listeners
[05:04:17] <Cork> if you for example add the same listener to each post you add to the page or something like that
[05:08:22] <bristleback> Cork: thank you! I understand that I might need to delegate the event listners to avoid duplicates
[05:08:52] <bristleback> Cork: but finding elements in the content generated will also do the job, right?
[05:09:05] <bristleback> Cork: I'm not sayign I will do that, just asking
[05:09:12] <bristleback> ohhh
[05:09:25] <bristleback> how can I see the event attached to an element?
[05:10:13] <bristleback> if I print it in console end then expand the object, at onclick event will say false, even though I have an onclick event since it works
[05:11:05] <Cork> bristleback: yes, but it will create a lot of duplicate event listeners
[05:11:12] <Cork> bristleback: and that slows down the page
[05:11:17] <Cork> so you want to avoid that if possible
[05:11:46] <Cork> bristleback: you can't see what events are attached to an element
[05:11:54] <Cork> bristleback: browsers doesn't expose that
[05:12:11] <bristleback> Cork: thanks!
[05:12:14] <Cork> bristleback: there is an internal object in jquery where jquery logs all the events IT has bound
[05:12:24] <Cork> but it isn't a public/supported api
[05:12:37] <Cork> so code that depends on it can break at any jquery update
[05:12:47] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[05:12:56] <Cork> where elm is the dom element, not a jquery object
[05:12:56] <nights> cork
[05:12:57] <nights> btw
[05:13:04] <nights> $('.payment_tab').prop('disabled', true);
[05:13:04] <nights> and
[05:13:09] <nights> document.getElementsByClassName('payment_tab').disabled = true;
[05:13:13] <nights> are not equal
[05:13:26] <nights> the jquery version doesnt work me on chrome
[05:13:41] <xec> the second shouldnt work anywhere
[05:13:45] <nights> yeah
[05:13:48] <nights> but what about the first one
[05:13:50] <nights> also
[05:13:52] <nights> this is for a <div>
[05:14:00] <bristleback> Cork: I don't understand though, why do you say the events will be duplicated if I search through the generated content and apply that event only to the elements found?
[05:14:10] <Cork> nights: div's not have a disabled property
[05:14:15] <nights> hm yes
[05:14:21] <Cork> nights: if you want to add random data use data-
[05:14:32] <nights> ok
[05:14:36] <nights> ok
[05:14:37] <nights> thanks
[05:14:38] <nights> i will do that
[05:14:41] <Cork> $('.payment_tab').data('disabled', true);
[05:14:46] <nights> ok thanks
[05:14:49] <nights> i understand my mistake now
[05:14:50] <nights> :(
[05:14:51] <bristleback> I mean, for example, in the old form, $(content).find(".static-action") was only returning the newly elements that were added
[05:14:52] <Cork> or if you want it as an attribute
[05:14:56] <nights> attr
[05:14:58] <Cork> $('.payment_tab').attr('data-disabled', true);
[05:15:01] <nights> yeah ok
[05:15:02] <nights> good
[05:15:03] <nights> good
[05:15:04] <nights> thans
[05:15:05] <nights> ks
[05:15:15] <Cork> nights: though note the second won't be a boolean
[05:15:20] <Cork> it will be saved as a string
[05:15:24] <xec> the enter key isn't for punctuation ;)
[05:15:36] <bristleback> so I suppose that $(content).find(".static-action").on("click", function() {}) would add an event only the what $(content).find(".static-action") returns
[05:15:47] <Cork> xec: that isn't even punctuation, its space
[05:15:54] <Cork> *it's
[05:16:08] <Cork> bristleback: yes
[05:16:15] <xec> thats true. nights: the enter key isn't for separating words ;)
[05:16:35] <molaga> i'm little lost with moving files to php file from jquery/ajax
[05:16:40] <molaga> here is my shot -> http://jsfiddle.net/EwKQY/
[05:17:19] <Cork> molaga: you need to add file[0].file to the formData
[05:17:24] <bristleback> well, then in my knowledgeless attempt it means I have succeded in my first attempt
[05:17:27] <Cork> not the jquery object
[05:17:44] <molaga> Cork, you mean with append?
[05:18:41] <Cork> molaga: var formData = new FormData(); formData.append('key-for-file', file[0].files[0])
[05:18:51] <Cork> bristleback: ok lets break down what you had before
[05:19:00] <Cork> $(content).find(".static-action").on("click", function() {})
[05:19:08] <bristleback> yes
[05:19:18] <Cork> $(content) will parse the html and create a fragment and wrap jquery around it
[05:19:22] <bristleback> where content was <li>...</li>
[05:19:41] <Cork> .find(".static-action") will then search in that fragment and grab the elements matching the selector
[05:20:00] <Cork> .on("click", function() {}) will then bind event listeners on those elements
[05:20:12] <Cork> after thing you don't store any of these elements
[05:20:16] <Cork> so they get deleted
[05:20:33] <Cork> you then run $(content) again or append(content) and parse the html to a new set of dom elements
[05:20:39] <Cork> as they are new no event listeners exist
[05:20:56] <Cork> bristleback: the base of the problem is; html isn't dom
[05:21:09] <nights> hm
[05:21:11] <nights> will try one more
[05:21:16] <nights> $('#CheckoutForm_room_number').attr('readonly', true);
[05:21:21] <nights> this isnt working in ie8
[05:21:24] <nights> any other ways? :S
[05:21:30] <Cork> nights: you want prop not attr
[05:21:40] <nights> hm
[05:21:43] <Cork> you can't change states with attributes
[05:21:44] <nights> but it works in chrome
[05:21:54] <Cork> ya, cause some browsers listend for attribute changes
[05:22:00] <nights> thats so confusing
[05:22:06] <Cork> while the spec only calls for property cheching
[05:22:08] <Cork> *checking
[05:22:09] <nights> makes me misuse attr
[05:22:17] <nights> hm
[05:22:18] <nights> ok
[05:22:28] <Cork> nights: attr is for accessing raw attributes
[05:22:35] <xec> even more confusing, in old jquery versions, .attr() actually modified properties
[05:22:37] <Cork> for every other situation you should use .prop()
[05:22:44] * xec leans back
[05:22:56] <bristleback> Cork: this is how I first did it: http://jsfiddle.net/49tGy/1/
[05:23:11] <nights> xec: yeah i know it changed in like 1.7
[05:23:17] <nights> confused ever since
[05:23:34] <bristleback> it worked, but I want to know if that was duplicating the events for .static-action
[05:23:42] <xec> nights: most likely you never want .attr() ;)
[05:23:44] <Cork> bristleback: that should work (except you do $(content) for no reason, as content is already a jquery object)
[05:24:15] <bristleback> so I should simply do content.find() ?
[05:25:02] <nights> sigh
[05:25:29] <nights> on IE even with read-only the edit text cursor still appears
[05:25:36] <xec> bristleback: that won't work because you're attaching the html string to DOM and then parsing it again with jquery, adding event listeners to some elements that will never be attached to the DOM
[05:25:49] <xec> oh nevermind me
[05:25:56] <xec> i didnt notice you wrapped the first string
[05:26:09] <bristleback> yeah I did :)
[05:26:28] <xec> on the other hand, js doesnt (well sort of) support multiline strings
[05:26:54] <Cork> ya, the html has linebreaks and that isn't supported
[05:27:00] <bristleback> that is only on jsfiddle
[05:27:06] <Cork> but i just suspected you posted the template in ''
[05:27:16] <murosai> var settings=null,limitToBaseFolder,limitToAccounts; <-- what's this line supposed to mean?
[05:27:23] <bristleback> on my real code I concatenate strings that are placed on multiple lines
[05:27:32] <Cork> murosai: defined three variables
[05:27:52] <Cork> murosai: two of them to undefined and one to null
[05:28:03] <murosai> oh i see, slightly confusing notation
[05:28:11] <xec> bristleback: but yes, just do content.find(...)
[05:28:20] <bristleback> thanks
[05:29:21] <xec> bristleback: it's the redundant wrapping that threw me for a loop there with my first comment ;)
[05:29:52] <bristleback> xec: I understand :)
[05:30:44] <Cork> bristleback: ya, same here
[05:31:00] <Cork> (and again we see why code is so important)
[05:31:07] <bristleback> :) Thank you!
[05:31:19] <molaga> Cork, now i get the call in the php, but how can i handle? i got null value for "print_r($_FILES)
[05:31:36] <molaga> and for print_r($_POST)
[05:31:48] <Cork> molaga: you should get it in $_FILES
[05:32:20] <molaga> i saw that the code you gave me opens the php file.. but nothing else
[05:32:45] <Cork> molaga: i just gave you how to build the formData object
[05:32:47] <Cork> nothing else
[05:32:56] <molaga> sec
[05:33:18] <Cork> molaga: might be the script exceeds the size of you upload limit?
[05:33:53] <molaga> txt file..
[05:33:54] <molaga> http://jsfiddle.net/T3xdE/
[05:34:28] <Cork> oh, nonono
[05:34:48] <Cork> molaga: the first argument to append is the name of the column not a jquery object
[05:35:14] <Cork> you could do something like .append(file.attr('name'), file[0].files[0]); if you like
[05:38:08] <ines> <xec> thank's for response, but i get correctly all the data of my form but not my input file content
[05:45:34] <molaga> Cork, the attr isn't good for me. don't i need the file as is? (file[0])?
[05:45:48] <Cork> molaga: what?
[05:45:54] <Cork> the file is the second argument
[05:46:12] <Cork> the first argument is what the data should be called in the post
[05:47:44] <molaga> ok, now i am going to bring the ring
[05:47:55] <molaga> saturday night is good for you?
[05:48:10] <molaga> thx mate, works
[05:49:55] <Caplain> $( "#title-"+window+", #window-"+window ).draggable();
[05:50:02] <molaga> Cork, in case i use multiple files, the only thing is dinamyc is the file[0].files[n] (the n)?
[05:50:02] <Caplain> i want to use the title to drag the window
[05:50:08] <Caplain> but its not acting that way
[05:50:10] <Caplain> lol
[05:50:16] <Cork> molaga: yes
[05:50:31] <Cork> molaga: as you base it on an id
[05:50:33] <molaga> cheers
[05:50:33] <Caplain> cork...from ezbake???
[05:50:47] <CrowX-> Cork, I implemented it. And I got the same results as earlier. Perhaps you could tell me why the onload event doesn't trigger every time the image 'previous' is changed. http://pastebin.com/wXHcaJQr
[05:50:51] <Cork> Caplain: no
[05:51:06] <Caplain> cork...good! :)
[05:51:10] <Caplain> lol
[05:51:42] <Cork> CrowX-: not sure
[05:52:00] <CrowX-> Cork, if it's of any help, it fires it every second time
[05:52:15] <Cork> CrowX-: i know that chrome isn't firing events for load an error more then once on an img tag
[05:52:20] <Cork> that might be what you see
[05:52:20] <Caplain> is there a way to use a titlebar to drag a div around?
[05:52:40] <Cork> Caplain: sure, specify the handle for the draggable
[05:52:43] <CrowX-> workaround?
[05:52:57] <Cork> CrowX-: replace the element instead of updating the element
[05:53:27] <Caplain> Cork, handle...that sounds perfect. idk how to define the handle though
[05:53:37] <CrowX-> Cork, can I replace it with something with the same name?
[05:53:53] <Cork> ?g api.jqueryui.com draggable
[05:53:53] <b-ot> Cork: Draggable Widget | jQuery UI API Documentation → http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/
[05:54:14] <Cork> CrowX-: sure
[05:54:23] <Cork> CrowX-: $().clone() should work (haven
[05:54:32] <Cork> *'t tested it though)
[05:56:01] <CrowX-> Cork, $(next) = $(next).clone()?
[05:56:05] <Cork> no
[05:56:17] <Cork> you need to create a new element
[05:56:21] <CrowX-> how
[05:56:21] <Cork> bind the load event
[05:56:28] <Cork> change the src element
[05:56:34] <Cork> and then replaceWith the old element
[05:58:33] <tonythomas> how to convert bind to a wrapper funciton so that it will call bind() when bind(args) is called ?
[05:58:59] <Cork> huh?
[05:59:22] <Cork> tonythomas: you might want to elaborate on that a bit
[05:59:43] <Cork> also are you talking about jquery bind or native js bind?
[05:59:52] <tonythomas> Cork: In my extension - actually mediawiki extension - VisualEditor, there is an assignment ve.bind = $.proxy;
[05:59:59] <CrowX-> Cork, how about this: $(previous).replaceWith($(previous).clone());
[06:00:10] <tonythomas> so that actually, $.proxy() gets called when ve.bind is called
[06:00:24] <tonythomas> Now, I need to replace this to use the native bind
[06:00:27] <Cork> CrowX-: that won't have an event listener or the new src
[06:00:51] <Cork> and what is ve?
[06:01:05] <tonythomas> I thought of giving something like ve.bind = ( function() return $.bind(); ) ;
[06:01:19] <tonythomas> ve is the visual editor object \
[06:01:25] <beasty> oh wow i just discoverd something
[06:01:38] <Cork> uh...
[06:01:41] <Cork> wait...
[06:01:43] <Cork> $.bind?
[06:01:50] <Cork> there is no $.bind
[06:02:03] <beasty> that let's say page a has a $.get(<page b>') and i can use all js that is loaded in page a in page b
[06:02:04] <Cork> are you talking about the $.fn.bind?
[06:02:22] <tonythomas> Cork:  to be exact, ve iis a list of instances of ve
[06:02:39] <tonythomas> Cork:  yeah. I am talking about the jquery function bind
[06:02:39] <Cork> tonythomas: is ve a jquery object?
[06:03:19] <tonythomas> Cork: of course, defined by var ve = { 'instances': [] };
[06:03:32] <Cork> hmm so no
[06:03:37] <tonythomas> it holds the instance of visual editor
[06:03:58] <Cork> i don't see how you would be able to use jquerys bind function if your not working with a jquery object
[06:04:21] <Cork> where is the elements stored=
[06:04:24] <Cork> *?
[06:05:00] <tonythomas> Cork: its not a jQuery variable ?
[06:05:07] <tonythomas> then a js var ?
[06:05:17] <Cork> its a variable sure
[06:05:24] <Cork> and it is an object
[06:05:28] <Cork> but not a jquery object
[06:05:34] <Cork> jquery objects is generated by $()
[06:05:41] <Cork> and the other jquery functions
[06:06:15] <Cork> tonythomas: so you would have to explain your object structure and what you want to do
[06:06:30] <Cork> else one can't answer your question
[06:06:32] <Caplain> Cork, i set the handler and now it works perfectly. thank you sir!!
[06:06:35] <tonythomas> Cork: and when I use ve.bind = $.proxy() ?
[06:06:54] <tonythomas> Cork: looks like my que needs a full explanation of the object base
[06:06:58] <Cork> tonythomas: $.<function names> is toolkits
[06:07:07] <Cork> tonythomas: they don't depend on the jquery object
[06:07:19] <Cork> $().functions do
[06:07:25] <Cork> and bind is one of those
[06:07:38] <Cork> tonythomas: again unless you talk about the native js bind
[06:07:58] <Cork> as you want to replace $.proxy it sounds like your looking for the native one
[06:08:02] <tonythomas> Cork:  I missed that ? I was talking about native bind
[06:08:07] <tonythomas> yeah
[06:08:17] <tonythomas> Cork:  sorry if I missed that point
[06:08:18] <Cork> tonythomas: just skip setting .bind then
[06:08:31] <Cork> tonythomas: func.bind() is all you need to use
[06:08:36] <tonythomas> you mean remove that assignmend ?
[06:08:50] <Cork> tonythomas: i don't have enough info to say exactly
[06:08:54] <Cork> but possibly
[06:09:08] <Cork> depends on what your code does with ve.bind
[06:09:23] <tonythomas> func.bind() should be changed everywhere I used the bind( args ) function right ?
[06:09:27] <tonythomas> ok
[06:09:39] <tonythomas> I was asked in the BZ to change ve.bind() to a wrapper that uses native .bind()
[06:09:47] <Cork> tonythomas: $.proxy works by $.proxy(func, args)
[06:09:58] <Cork> the native bind works with func.bind(args)
[06:10:14] <Cork> so you would have to create a compatibility layer if you want to have the old syntax
[06:10:49] <tonythomas> They pointed that, if its need to be changed, a lot needs to done, changing every single code that uses the existing bind
[06:11:15] <tonythomas> thats why they put forward the idea of converting bind to a wrapper function that uses native .bind()
[06:11:20] <tonythomas> looks reasonable
[06:11:42] <tonythomas> can you extend a bit on that compatiability layer ?
[06:11:52] <CrowX-> Cork, is this ok? or clone() would do better? http://pastebin.com/U3rHgVMM
[06:12:08] <CrowX-> sorry for the indentation
[06:12:25] <Cork> CrowX-: except you will replace the element with the old id with one with the id temp
[06:13:16] <CrowX-> $(that.previous).replaceWith(temp.clone());
[06:13:17] <CrowX-> ?
[06:13:37] <tonythomas> Cork:  can you tell me what happens when the assignment ve.bind = $.proxy; is done ?
[06:14:09] <tonythomas> its called like 'mouseup': ve.bind( this.onDocumentMouseUp, this ); in the codebase
[06:19:06] <CrowX-> Cork, how about? $(previous).html($(temp).html());
[06:21:55] <teza19> Hi, I'd like to trigger a notification through my admin panel to display on the front-end for any new visitors to the website. Once they click 'X' I want it to disappear, and never show again - how can I achieve this?
[06:25:39] <decx> cookies
[06:26:19] <plushwork> hey guys. How can I get an outer height of the container and all elements inside it?
[06:26:59] <plushwork> I have a div and a h4 in it has a margin that flows out of the container and ain't counted in outerHeight
[06:35:42] <TheWhisper> Hey, I have a margin: 0 auto; to center my div
[06:35:52] <TheWhisper> and I'd like to animate that to margin-left: 6%;
[06:36:09] <TheWhisper> but when I do that, it instantly moves the div to the left
[06:36:17] <Genesis_> afternoon all
[06:36:20] <TheWhisper> and then slides in from the left to the right 6%
[06:36:27] <beasty> afternoon Genesis_
[06:36:34] <Genesis_> quick question
[06:36:37] <TheWhisper> I want it to slide from margin: 0 auto (centered) leftwards to 6%
[06:36:46] <Genesis_> I am trying to make a cycling banner, that will cycle through a picture every 3 seconds
[06:36:49] <Genesis_> would the best way to do this be
[06:37:05] <Genesis_> to have an array with the picture names, then do a for loop, and have a sleep at every for loop recursive call?
[06:37:15] <xec> TheWhisper: "auto" is not an animatable(is that a word?) value
[06:37:32] <xec> TheWhisper: so you basically can't do that unfortunately
[06:37:37] <TheWhisper> Are there any plugins that will allow me to do it?
[06:37:44] <TheWhisper> Like a plugin that converts auto to X value
[06:37:49] <TheWhisper> and then inputs that to the animate?
[06:38:01] <xec> TheWhisper: you can get the current position, set it as left value, then do the animation
[06:38:09] <TheWhisper> How?
[06:38:44] <xec> `api position @ TheWhisper
[06:38:44] <b-ot> TheWhisper: .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[06:38:54] <TheWhisper> thanks
[06:40:07] <xec> Genesis_: if by "sleep" you mean setTimeout, then that sounds like a good idea as any
[06:40:31] <xec> Genesis_: but if you already have the images in html, you can just use the jquery selection
[06:40:33] <xec> er, collection
[06:40:44] <Genesis_> xec: thanks, I'm a c programmer xP
[06:40:58] <Genesis_> xec: the image location will be extracted from a .txt file
[06:41:06] <Genesis_> its a bit more complex of a problem but I am taking it a step at a time
[06:41:09] <CrowX-> How do I replace an element's contents with another elements' contents, including attributes?
[06:41:55] <BillCris_> CrowX-: Like... replace the element entirely?
[06:42:13] <CrowX-> BillCris_, except its id
[06:42:28] <beasty> Genesis_: text document ?
[06:42:34] <Genesis_> beasty: yes.
[06:42:39] <beasty> learn to structure it in a json :)
[06:42:44] <beasty> easier to parse
[06:42:59] <BillCris_> CrowX-: Sheesh.
[06:43:10] <CrowX-> BillCris_, I tried "$(selector1) = $(selector2).clone()"
[06:43:19] <CrowX-> but it doesn't accept it
[06:43:22] <BillCris_> Might be better off saving the id, replacing the element completely then adding the id to it.
[06:44:24] <beasty> o wow i wished i had to write something advanced in js today :(
[06:45:00] <BillCris_> CrowX-: I'd like like var id = $originalElement.attr('id'); $originalElement.replaceWith($someOtherElement.attr('id', id)); I guess.
[06:45:19] <TheWhisper> Okay, xec, I've got the position now
[06:45:40] <hooliogan132>  http://jsfiddle.net/n25hM/41/ <-- still need some help working out how to get the white pulsing particles to rotate like the rest of the speheres and does any one think the pink particles spoil it a bit?
[06:45:50] <TheWhisper> not sure how to animate the received value to 6% of the window though
[06:46:14] <BillCris_> CrowX-: I'd try to avoid having to do that in the first place though.
[06:48:24] <CrowX-> BillCriswell, how then do I delete an element completely?
[06:48:50] <BillCriswell> .remove()
[06:48:50] <b-ot> BillCriswell: firing because .slideUp() is already executed, though it is still animating
[06:48:56] <BillCriswell> ... Ok.
[06:50:01] <fabioportieri> happy friday guys
[06:50:50] <BillCriswell> You as well, fabioportieri
[06:51:40] <fabioportieri> BillCriswell++
[06:51:53] <xec> TheWhisper: can you sfiddle demo with what you have so far?
[06:52:05] <TheWhisper> sec
[06:52:06] <xec> make a*
[06:52:11] <xec> jsfiddle*
[06:52:11] <TheWhisper> I'll just push to the site
[06:53:03] <TheWhisper> xec http://discoverdan.com/index_wip
[06:53:22] <TheWhisper> custom.js, line 28
[06:53:42] <TheWhisper> I'm using the header variable for the animate function btw
[06:53:47] <dwarder> i have texts in <span class='text'>  ... like many of them,   i  neeed a string that is separated by new line
[06:53:48] <TheWhisper> so the animation won't work right now
[06:53:51] <dwarder> how can i do this
[06:54:06] <dwarder> $('.text').text();
[06:54:07] <dwarder> ?
[06:54:20] <dwarder> gives me one line
[06:54:32] <dwarder> i want the lines separated by new line
[06:54:37] <xec> TheWhisper: when is the animation supposed to run?
[06:54:44] <xec> i.e. what do i click
[06:54:45] <TheWhisper> Clicking a link
[06:55:04] <TheWhisper> But it won't run, as I said, because in line 28 I'm useing header as the selector
[06:55:07] <TheWhisper> *using
[06:55:13] <TheWhisper> and header is the variable define on line 27
[06:55:17] <TheWhisper> for getting position of #header
[06:55:32] <dwarder> anyone?
[06:56:01] <xec> TheWhisper: ah, i see. looks like it get 0 as the value, try .offset().left instead
[06:56:11] <TheWhisper> wait, really?
[06:56:13] <dwarder> $('.text').each().text();
[06:56:13] <dwarder> ?
[06:56:15] <TheWhisper> It printed a vlue for me before
[06:56:17] <TheWhisper> *value
[06:56:36] <xec> i get 0/0 with $("#header").position()
[06:56:38] <TheWhisper> oh
[06:56:40] <TheWhisper> uh
[06:56:44] <TheWhisper> should it be position.left()?
[06:56:53] <xec> no, .position().left
[06:58:07] <TheWhisper> hm
[06:58:18] <TheWhisper> Xec, I get this error in the console then: "TypeError: a.ownerDocument is undefined"
[06:58:23] <TheWhisper> in the jquery file
[06:58:41] <dwarder> how do i cave \n separated #result http://jsfiddle.net/4Z9Pc/
[06:58:46] <dwarder> do i have*
[06:58:47] <dwarder> ?
[06:59:32] <dwarder> anyone?
[06:59:45] <dwarder> Cork: you there?
[07:00:41] <Genesis_> in a for loop
[07:00:47] <Genesis_> how would I add a delay on each call?
[07:00:58] <Genesis_> do I add the delay inside the for loop?
[07:01:03] <xec> TheWhisper: looks like you're passing the header variable to $()
[07:01:08] <Genesis_> looks like the convention is after the for loop
[07:01:08] <TheWhisper> yes
[07:01:15] <xec> TheWhisper: don't?
[07:01:24] <TheWhisper> ...
[07:01:29] <TheWhisper> What should I pass?
[07:01:36] <dwarder> Genesis_: you can't
[07:01:43] <xec> .offset() returns an object with left and right integers
[07:01:51] <Genesis_> dwarder: What do you mean? How would I delay a recursive call then?
[07:02:05] <xec> TheWhisper: use $("#header") to select the header...
[07:02:07] <Cork> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/4Z9Pc/1/
[07:02:11] <TheWhisper> ...
[07:02:21] <xec> TheWhisper: $(header) doesn't make sense
[07:02:27] <TheWhisper> xec, where do I insert the position values t hen
[07:02:29] <TheWhisper> *then
[07:02:38] <xec> TheWhisper: you set the left-margin
[07:02:55] <xec> TheWhisper: .css("left-margin", $("#header").offset().left)
[07:03:01] <TheWhisper> okay
[07:03:09] <xec> before the animation
[07:03:13] <TheWhisper> ah
[07:03:13] <dwarder> Cork: ohh, like this... thank you :)
[07:03:25] <xec> err margin-left
[07:03:29] <xec> i got it backwards
[07:03:35] <dwarder> Genesis_: tell the whole problem
[07:03:49] <Genesis_> dwarder: I have a for loop that is going to append an image to a div.
[07:03:57] <Genesis_> I need it to wait 3 seconds before inserting the next image
[07:04:21] <dwarder> Genesis_:  window.setTimeout(function(){}); but it will thread
[07:04:25] <Parsi> how can i create a regex to validate this: {four digit number between 1380-1410}/{one or two digit number between 1-12}/{one or two digit number between 1-31}
[07:04:35] <Genesis_> drwarder: wat do you mean by "thread"
[07:05:06] <TheWhisper> Still doesn't work, xec
[07:05:19] <Genesis_> dwarder: I can't have the initial image have a delay, its every call after it.
[07:05:19] <TheWhisper> It animates in from the wrong side still
[07:05:19] <dwarder> Genesis_: what is inside setTimeout will run at the same time as your for loop continues
[07:05:32] <xec> TheWhisper: did you publish the latest attempt?
[07:05:37] <TheWhisper> sec
[07:06:01] <TheWhisper> Pushed, xec
[07:06:22] <xec> TheWhisper: the console logs 0
[07:06:33] <TheWhisper> Shows X value for me
[07:06:42] <xec> what browser?
[07:06:45] <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/HdjgT8k.png
[07:06:47] <TheWhisper> firefox
[07:07:34] <TheWhisper> Ha, it animates fine in Chrome
[07:07:36] <xec> appears to work in chrome
[07:07:37] <xec> yeah
[07:08:43] <xec> TheWhisper: but  "margin-left":"headerLeft" doesnt make sense either
[07:08:44] <TheWhisper> Any suggestions, xec?
[07:08:59] <TheWhisper> I'm seting margin-left to the variable headerLeft
[07:09:00] <xec> TheWhisper: why are you passing "headerLeft" as a string?
[07:09:01] <TheWhisper> *setting
[07:09:16] <xec> oh its the new var name. i see, just lose the quotes then
[07:09:31] <TheWhisper> Ah
[07:09:33] <TheWhisper> Works fine in FF now
[07:09:37] <TheWhisper> after I removed the quotes
[07:09:40] <xec> :)
[07:09:48] <TheWhisper> Okay, now to figure out how to reverse it :P
[07:10:05] <xec> hehe in what sense
[07:10:12] <xec> go back to the middle?
[07:10:15] <TheWhisper> If I click the logo, it should animate back to the middle
[07:10:40] <xec> well, you could just cache the headerLeft value in an outer scope
[07:10:47] <xec> and animate to that
[07:10:49] <TheWhisper> hm
[07:10:54] <TheWhisper> good idea
[07:11:16] <xec> and not worry about people who resize their browser (no user does this, but some people flip their phone)
[07:12:12] <xec> and worst case, it just doesnt go to the middle (no biggie)
[07:13:15] <TheWhisper> mhm
[07:15:18] <TheWhisper> xec, I could also put something in my function that monitors resizing anyway
[07:15:29] <xec> yeah
[07:15:36] <xec> i wouldn't bother personally ;)
[07:17:22] <decx> use data() to save positional states without vars
[07:18:01] <xec> decx: except there is no benefit over a simple variable..?
[07:18:12] <xec> (in this case)
[07:18:19] <decx> probably i just fancy it :>

[07:24:28] <Harrold> Is there any plugin I can use to make a toggleable menu like the one on this site: http://tasef.be/en ?
[07:25:06] <xec> Harrold: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[07:25:57] <decx> bit overkill don't you think
[07:26:23] <decx> li click function this next ul slideToggle
[07:26:31] <Harrold> xec: Do you know if I can also use that for nested toggles?
[07:27:45] <decx> Harrold accordion is for content
[07:27:55] <decx> use .menu() if you want to use jquery ui
[07:28:22] <decx> or just make one yourself, it's a oneliner for the basic functionality
[07:29:48] <Harrold> decx: I see, I will search further than, just a beginner, only have to make a prototype
[07:29:52] <Harrold> then*
[07:29:55] <xec> most likely, there is no client side script making that meny
[07:29:59] <xec> menu*
[07:30:36] <Harrold> xec: It was an example, doesn't have to be exact the same thing, it was about the toggle functionality
[07:31:19] <bristleback> I have a listner attached to a button. The function defined in that listner will first call $("#test-use-case-modal").dialog("open"); (dialog is from jquery-ui, the one that opens a modal form) and then will call $.ajax in asynchronous mode to make a request to the server
[07:31:38] <bowenac> anyone know how I can use an ajax json value outside of the success http://pastebin.com/AaF2QdqB
[07:31:58] <bristleback> the problem is that the dialog box will not open until the axaj request is finished unless I do a sync ajax
[07:32:08] <bristleback> anyone knows what is the problem
[07:32:09] <bristleback> ?
[07:34:43] <xec> bristleback: wait what? you're saying the dialog box will open before the ajax is done but only if you're doing it synchronously?
[07:36:12] <bristleback> yes
[07:36:14] <bristleback> indeed
[07:36:31] <bristleback> xec: ^^
[07:36:58] <xec> sounds very strange to me :/
[07:37:02] <xec> what does your code look like?
[07:37:21] <bristleback> xec: if it's hard to believe it I can share the code, though it's very lengthy and poorly written

[07:58:37] <xec> bristleback: where is the popup-opening code?
[07:59:10] <bristleback> you mean where I initialize the dialog?

[08:02:01] <xec> bristleback: yeah okay, i meant, what part is working with sync request, but not with async?
[08:02:26] <xec> actually, i have to go, sorry about that

[08:06:18] <bowenac> anyone know how I can turn this http response into a usable string url: wnm_custom.plugin_url+'/getgcalfeed.php',
[08:07:06] <bowenac> its logs http response from the echo from the getgcalfeed.php but how can I use the http response value as url:
[08:07:44] <hooliogan132> $_SERVER holds some variables you can combine with that response to make a url
[08:08:13] <farn5w0rth> anyone worked with highcharts that can help me out? i need a click event for if the user clicks on the grey boxes: http://cl.ly/image/1t1i2C47441O

[08:17:03] <hooliogan132> die("damnit");
[08:25:59] <bowenac> hooliogan132 any other ideas? I tried this var link = wnm_custom.plugin_url+'/getgcalfeed.php'; then url: String(link),
[08:26:09] <bowenac> still just spits it out as a response doesnt use the response value
[08:26:27] <thezanke> what is the result of just echoing the url
[08:26:38] <thezanke> is it the right url?
[08:26:53] <hellhound> hey guys, is there a way to place an event handler to be executed when the browser receives an attachment file response?
[08:26:56] <bowenac> yes if I actually paste the response url for url: the actual httpresponse it works
[08:27:13] <bowenac> how do I echo the php variable in a js file?
[08:27:28] <thezanke> you dont
[08:27:48] <bowenac> exactly so what options do I have
[08:28:13] <thezanke> what are you needed, exactly, I think I am missing something
[08:28:17] <beancurd> echo it in the php as a js var, then have your js script get it?

[08:28:46] <thezanke> if the url is right, are you setting up the ajax wrong?
[08:29:50] <thezanke> so you want to ajax a file "getgcalfeed.php" and that file then responds with a string you want to use as a url in a different ajax call?
[08:29:55] <thezanke> or in something
[08:30:17] <bowenac> kind of yea
[08:30:49] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/vh4bXcse
[08:31:55] <bowenac> I tried using ajax post but couldnt use the var outside of the success
[08:32:33] <bowenac> http://pastebin.com/dFLszGnj
[08:32:44] <Manaus> hello, can I add a custom key to an object, e.g. $('.mydiv').myvalue = 100 ?
[08:33:50] <thezanke> bowenac, http://pastebin.com/D4rfP3dy ?
[08:34:25] <thezanke> obviously youd have to finish your object
[08:38:56] <thezanke> in repsonse to your second paste, you cant use the variable anywhere else because its scoped within the function, you could set to it an object like window but the code will still need to know when to use it. ajax take time and unless you tell it to your code will continue running without the reply, unless the code is called by the success, or the sucess uses getters and setters that trigger the part of the code to run that uses the variable
[08:39:17] <thezanke> success*
[08:39:39] <bowenac> thanks that might get me there, just need to modify it a bit as I dont want the whole js file inside an ajax request
[08:40:14] <thezanke> Well, if its a necessary ajax request it wouldnt hurt to make it wait on it, one sec I can make it look less sloppy
[08:41:25] <bowenac> the full calendar part goes to the end of the file
[08:42:56] <bowenac> seems like it would have to be though
[08:43:47] <bowenac> the url is wrong
[08:43:57] <bowenac> its sending the url parsed onto the end of the current url lol
[08:45:08] <bowenac> thezanke this is the contents of the gcal php file http://pastebin.com/nhmhvsEU
[08:46:23] <thezanke> ah
[08:46:35] <thezanke> what does it echo, exactly, in json
[08:47:23] <thezanke> like the string
[08:47:38] <thezanke> if you just browse to the file
[08:47:57] <bowenac> thezanke if I alert it "https:\/\/www.google.com\/calendar\/feeds\/adamcbowen81%40gmail.com\/public\/basic"
[08:48:30] <bowenac> zankey but when I use it  mywebpage/"https:\/\/www.google.com\/calendar\/feeds\/adamcbowen81%40gmail.com\/public\/basic"
[08:48:57] <bowenac> thezanke which is wierd
[08:49:00] <thezanke> tell me if this gets it any closer
[08:49:00] <thezanke> http://pastebin.com/E6UZAAf4
[08:49:09] <thezanke> its because it was json encoded, so wrapped in quotes
[08:49:27] <Cyclohexane> Can someone help me get this working? http://jsfiddle.net/3cfwu/ I'd like it to hide all lines starting with '>' (ideally group multiples too)
[08:52:27] <thezanke> Cyclohexane, by hide do you mean remove?
[08:53:03] <Cyclohexane> thezanke: ultimately the plan is to toggle visible/hidden
[08:55:14] <thezanke> they will need containers around each "line"
[08:55:33] <bowenac> causes my next function for the calendar to SyntaxError: function statement requires a name 	  viewDisplay: function( event, element, view ) {
[08:56:05] <BillCriswell> Cyclohexane: http://jsfiddle.net/3cfwu/1/ I came up with this... sure there's something wrong with it somewhere though.
[08:56:46] <Cyclohexane> thanks BillCriswell that's a start
[08:58:26] <BillCriswell> Cyclohexane: http://jsfiddle.net/3cfwu/2/ This way would keep you from needing to look for &gt; over just >.
[09:00:41] <bowenac> thezanke got it with the previous one had to add the datatype
[09:01:10] <thezanke> rock on, you can also put JSON.parse(anyJsonString)
[09:01:17] <thezanke> instead of dataType
[09:01:21] <bowenac> thezanke http://pastebin.com/QfXP7jun
[09:01:43] <bowenac> is one better than the other?
[09:01:45] <thezanke> Cyclohexane, if you can add spans around every line you could do this http://jsfiddle.net/3cfwu/3/
[09:02:36] <thezanke> bowenac, I dont think so, I just use dataType "json" if running .ajax since that feature exists for that purpose
[09:02:46] <thezanke> any other time i would use JSON.parse out of necessity
[09:03:06] <bowenac> yea this works pretty good actually having it all in the ajax
[09:03:18] <bowenac> I should show a loading gif till the ajax success
[09:03:27] <bowenac> otherwise its just blank lol
[09:03:35] <bowenac> or show something
[09:06:51] <thezanke> yeah
[09:07:07] <thezanke> use beforeSend: function() {} in the .ajax({})
[09:07:17] <thezanke> and in the function have it display a loading gif or something
[09:07:27] <duch_kazatel> oooh ajax loading gifs?
[09:07:27] <bowenac> thanks again for the help
[09:07:30] <duch_kazatel> yaaaay
[09:07:42] <bowenac> would I put that before the .success
[09:07:51] <bowenac> pretty new to ajax
[09:08:09] <bowenac> I was just going to addClass hide in the success to the gif img
[09:10:02] <bowenac> maybe a bootstrap progress bar
[09:10:05] <bowenac> lol
[09:14:12] <Kamuela> How do i know which ajax function to use of jquery?
[09:14:22] <Kamuela> I ended up using Post but I wonder... why did I do it
[09:14:23] <Kamuela> haha
[09:14:34] <Kamuela> so many ways of doing the same thing
[09:14:57] <BillCriswell> My screen is gross. I thought I had a noisy pattern in the background of an image.. .definitely wasnt.
[09:17:24] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela $.ajax() is the underlying method for all of those - the difference is in how it sends/recieves data, kind of.
[09:17:56] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela if your goal is to send stuff, POST it.  if you want to retrieve stuff, GET it.
[09:18:17] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i’ve had those days before.
[09:19:07] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: well basically i did an ajax call posting a form and receiving data in return to draw a new div
[09:19:11] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: i used post
[09:19:17] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela that’s fine.
[09:19:45] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: what did event.target.serialize() do for me?
[09:20:20] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela i’d have to see your code, but i’ll bet event.target is a form, and you’re running this method on the data: https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:21:01] <Kamuela> duch_kazatel: yeah exactly. haha, i wrote it all myself. but the .serialize() was trial and error
[09:21:21] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela mind posting your code real quick up in a fiddle?
[09:21:48] <thezanke> Cyclohexane, http://jsfiddle.net/3cfwu/4/ another example, for good measure, will wrap all "lines" in spans automatically
[09:21:51] <Kamuela> it was from a few days ago, i might still have it but i was just thinking about it
[09:21:52] <Kamuela> let me see
[09:22:44] <abailarri> Anyone has used ckeditor 4 with twitter bootstrap 3? I implemented with this code but not loads http://jsfiddle.net/AHbHU/1/
[09:22:48] <abailarri> any suggestion?
[09:23:19] <Kamuela> ok i don't, but i rememember every part of what i was doing. yes event was a form, i did an document.onready submit for elements in a certain class, it was like post-comment or something, and then i used that particular target's data to send to the PHP controller and the callback was a deeconstructed version of the same data to draw back into the div
[09:23:19] <duch_kazatel> abailarri i’m seeing the editor show.
[09:23:26] <Kamuela> e.g. i took being able to read the data back as a success
[09:25:15] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, what?
[09:25:31] <duch_kazatel> abailarri what isn’t working?
[09:25:44] <abailarri> i don't know
[09:26:38] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, in jsfiddle works
[09:26:46] <abailarri> but in my bootstrap web no
[09:27:44] <abailarri> in the console I see some error but I believe that are not relacionated
[09:28:27] <ocx_> Hello, is it fine to declare an eventlistener on some div element, on deviceready m and then define the div afterwards in the body >
[09:28:59] <duch_kazatel> ocx_ share some code.
[09:31:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm having this weird issue today we're I'm not trusting my auto complete.
[09:31:45] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell oh?
[09:33:41] <BillCriswell> Yeah....
[09:33:44] <BillCriswell> Shady.
[09:33:48] <duch_kazatel> in irc?  or in life?
[09:34:08] <BillCriswell> My text editor haha.
[09:34:17] <BillCriswell> Chinese food ime I think.
[09:34:19] <BillCriswell> Er no.
[09:34:24] <BillCriswell> Hoagie.
[09:34:29] <BillCriswell> Yes, hoagie. I'll be back.
[09:34:31] <duch_kazatel> still wrong.
[09:34:32] <duch_kazatel> beer.
[09:34:38] <dni> prost!
[09:35:17] <duch_kazatel> na zdravi!
[09:36:00] <duch_kazatel> ein prosit, ein prosit, der gemütlichkeit
[09:38:01] <StanAccy> Why is $('#id select') less efficient cf. $('#id').find('select') ?
[09:38:18] <beasty> is there a way to get the outerhtml from a element ?
[09:38:43] <beasty> like <label>foo</label> => $('label').outerHTML() ? or somthing
[09:40:42] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy because the second one reduces the area of the DOM you’re looking in.
[09:41:26] <duch_kazatel> you could also do $(‘select’, ‘#id’), which basically maps to .find() iirc.
[09:43:18] <duch_kazatel> beasty what would you expect to get with that?
[09:46:17] <BillCriswell> beasty: $('#foo')[0].outerHTML()
[09:46:27] <amcsi_work> how do I subscribe to middle click scrolling events?
[09:46:43] <duch_kazatel> amcsi_work huh?  which one?  scroll, or middle click?
[09:47:05] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell wait is that an actual method?
[09:47:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yesh.
[09:47:30] <Rashad> Hello.
[09:47:32] <amcsi_work> duch_kazatel, go to firefox, click or hold middle click and you'll see what I'm talking about
[09:47:41] <Rashad> What's the best way to make js call a function every X seconds?
[09:47:48] <amcsi_work> (on any page where you can scroll of course)
[09:47:51] <duch_kazatel> Rashad use timeouts.
[09:48:00] <duch_kazatel> amcsi_work ah, that’s what you’re talking about.
[09:48:14] <amcsi_work> duch_kazatel, yes, and it doesn't fire onscroll
[09:49:49] <ankurk_> Well I am trying to multiple filters on rows, but it isn't working as expected, http://jsbin.com/zozuciha/1/edit
[09:49:51] <duch_kazatel> Rashad i’d avoid doing that if possible, though.
[09:50:28] <Rashad> Why?
[09:51:03] <duch_kazatel> amcsi_work you’d need to look at the mousedown event and see which button was activated.  not sure which event fires when that scrolls though.
[09:51:43] <duch_kazatel> Rashad if possible, rely on some other event to update data, otherwise you’ll need to write a lot of logic that pauses timers until the request completes.
[09:53:41] <Rashad> Well I am just using this to show the user the number of users online.
[09:53:54] <Rashad> And I want this to be updated every 10 seconds.
[09:54:29] <duch_kazatel> Rashad all right then.  make sure you pause your timer when you fire off a new request and then resume when that request completes.
[09:54:53] <Rashad> What do you mean by request?
[09:55:14] <Rashad> I am using socket.io so all "requests" (if I understand you correctly) are asynchronous.
[09:55:36] <duch_kazatel> Rashad the ajax - you’ll want to wait until the ajax finishes.  and if you’re using sockets, isn’t there a push-style thing you can do?
[09:55:59] <Rashad> What do you mean?
[09:56:07] <Rashad> What's a push-style?
[09:56:37] <Rashad> I simply "emit" an event to the server, and the server responds, and I don't have to care about other requests happening at the same time.
[09:56:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that’s basically what i’m talking about.  no need for ajax.
[09:57:26] <Rashad> Yeah.
[09:57:32] <Rashad> It's pretty neat actually.
[10:11:53] <th3m1773n> Hi everyone! Hi jphase =)
[10:12:23] <duch_kazatel> hello
[10:12:27] <th3m1773n> jphase: so yesterday I failed miserably to modify any of Redactor's behaviors ^^
[10:13:15] <th3m1773n> I know it's not a core jquery question, but how should I go about changing the markup generated by Redactor (a jQuery wysiwyg editor)
[10:13:37] <duch_kazatel> don’t ;)
[10:13:38] <th3m1773n> For instance, as soon as it adds an image, add some attributes and styles to it
[10:13:52] <th3m1773n> ouch
[10:13:52] <th3m1773n> lol
[10:14:15] <duch_kazatel> http://imperavi.com/redactor/docs/settings/
[10:14:17] <th3m1773n> By default redactor outputs and img as <p><img></p>!
[10:14:37] <duch_kazatel> use these. otherwise, you’re kind of sol.  we use redactor here for some stuff and it’s kind of painful.
[10:14:41] <th3m1773n> duch_kazatel: Yeah I read the whole doc 10 times ^^ Nothing to actually change the generated markup
[10:14:49] <duch_kazatel> right.  there’s a reason for that.
[10:15:08] <duch_kazatel> unless you want to patch it yourself.
[10:15:13] <duch_kazatel> but that’s kind of a bad idea imo.
[10:15:28] <th3m1773n> Yeah, I can't anyways, not open source anymore ^^
[10:15:38] <th3m1773n> But is there any way to detect a change inside Redactor's iframe and act on it?
[10:15:40] <duch_kazatel> you can edit the JS they diuve you.
[10:15:45] <duch_kazatel> *give
[10:15:50] <duch_kazatel> what iframe?
[10:15:57] <duch_kazatel> because seriously that’s a really bad idea.
[10:15:59] <th3m1773n> it's obfuscated for clients ^^
[10:16:15] <th3m1773n> Well the ifrae that the editor resides in
[10:16:29] <th3m1773n> so there is absolutely no way to set an image size, alt tag, etc...?
[10:16:31] <duch_kazatel> i really wouldn’t do that.
[10:16:41] <duch_kazatel> other than what’s in the docs, no.
[10:16:53] <duch_kazatel> i mean, it’s possible, but it’ll be unreliable and hacky.
[10:17:09] <duch_kazatel> just use a different WYSIWYG
[10:17:14] <th3m1773n> well, it's for one single purpose so maybe it wouldn't be too bad
[10:17:21] <th3m1773n> yeah... yeah I guess I should just do that
[10:17:23] <duch_kazatel> if you say so :)
[10:17:42] <th3m1773n> The thing is, I have no idea how to detect an event within the redactor iframe
[10:17:49] <duch_kazatel> where is the iframe?
[10:18:42] <th3m1773n> well, in a <div class="redactor_box">
[10:18:42] <duch_kazatel> because i’m looking at it right now and i’m not seeing one.
[10:18:46] <th3m1773n> really?
[10:19:00] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:19:27] <th3m1773n> mine is a <ul> for the toolbar and an <iframe> for the actual editor
[10:19:36] <th3m1773n> both within a .redactor_box div
[10:19:36] <duch_kazatel> and you can access the contents of an iframe, but for what you want to do it’s a baaaad idea.
[10:19:47] <th3m1773n> ok I think I'm convinced :p
[10:20:15] <th3m1773n> The people who built this web app really didn't think when they implemented redactor
[10:20:28] <duch_kazatel> what does the app do?
[10:20:39] <th3m1773n> Design and track email campaigns
[10:20:46] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:20:59] <th3m1773n> And HTML email is extremely (extrreeeemely) specific about allowed markup and css
[10:21:08] <duch_kazatel> i know.  i’ve done it before ;)
[10:21:18] <th3m1773n> coding like it's '98 all over again :p
[10:21:20] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:21:26] <th3m1773n> so redactor isn't really up to the task
[10:21:33] <duch_kazatel> not surprising
[10:21:44] <th3m1773n> seriously I built this awesome responsive template, and I can't make it editable
[10:21:59] <th3m1773n> unless I allow it to get completely destroyed
[10:22:18] <th3m1773n> duch_kazatel: so since you're familiar with HTML email, what would you recommend as a wysiwyg?
[10:22:26] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn’t tbh.
[10:22:36] <th3m1773n> ayou're right
[10:22:39] <duch_kazatel> at our place, we build templates and have people copy/paste info into them.  not for HTML email, but for our use of redactor.
[10:22:39] <th3m1773n> but here's my idea
[10:22:51] <th3m1773n> yes, that's what I want to do
[10:23:04] <duch_kazatel> i mean the raw markup, not touching the actual redactor controls.
[10:23:20] <th3m1773n> yeah, I wanna build a little further on that
[10:23:30] <th3m1773n> basically reduce the wysiwyg capabilities to the insertion of predefined blocks
[10:23:36] <th3m1773n> no change in style/markup
[10:23:42] <duch_kazatel> redactor is not the right place to do that imo.
[10:23:46] <th3m1773n> absolutely
[10:24:02] <th3m1773n> I did hack together a way with the Clips plugin, but it stops at images
[10:24:19] <th3m1773n> so do you think tinymce or ckeditor could work?
[10:24:40] <th3m1773n> or any other wysiwyg for that matter
[10:24:55] <duch_kazatel> dunno.  i have no clue what your audience is.
[10:25:03] <th3m1773n> basically all the user does is replace the big picture, replace the placeholder text with his own
[10:25:21] <th3m1773n> But he can't do it with html, and needs to see what the newsletter looks like
[10:25:34] <duch_kazatel> is that literally it?
[10:25:38] <th3m1773n> which is why I need wysiwyg even though I hate it ^^
[10:25:39] <duch_kazatel> because you could build that.
[10:25:50] <th3m1773n> no, I couldn't :p
[10:25:54] <th3m1773n> I'm a total js noob
[10:25:59] <th3m1773n> as in TOTAL
[10:26:11] <duch_kazatel> then learn ;)
[10:26:25] <th3m1773n> I would absolutely love to
[10:26:29] <th3m1773n> and I will
[10:26:33] <th3m1773n> but this is not the time
[10:26:39] <th3m1773n> not this particular project
[10:26:54] <ankurk_> and I am still stuck at filtering :|
[10:27:15] <th3m1773n> I just need to find a quick way for the user to make a limited subset of modifications to a template
[10:27:36] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ you mean jquery filtering?  i’ll look at your bin.
[10:27:37] <th3m1773n> And once I'm done with that project, I'll start learning properly!
[10:27:56] <duch_kazatel> th3m1773n you’re going to spend more time hacking that together and maintining it in the long run.
[10:28:03] <ankurk_> this one's more comprehensive, http://jsbin.com/gahubika/1/edit
[10:28:22] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ so what do you want to have happen?
[10:28:32] <th3m1773n> duch_kazatel: I believe you, and I hate doing that kind of stuff, but I only have one or two days to put something together, so can't make anything from the ground up
[10:28:38] <ankurk_> I want to combine all filters basically, named, oac, priority, and closed
[10:28:54] <duch_kazatel> th3m1773n bummer.
[10:29:03] <th3m1773n> duch_kazatel:  I know...
[10:29:14] <th3m1773n> I'll try to make the best of it though
[10:29:16] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ not sure what that means.  could you clarify?
[10:29:45] <duch_kazatel> th3m1773n whoever said it should only take 2 days needs to not give estimates any more ;)
[10:29:48] <ankurk_> if I am selecting from oac, priority should filter from that result
[10:30:03] <ankurk_> or closed should filter from priority's result
[10:30:14] <th3m1773n> duch_kazatel: probably ^^
[10:30:23] <ankurk_> bottom, they should be able to work together
[10:30:36] <ankurk_> just like in this one, http://isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering.html
[10:30:38] <th3m1773n> but then again, we didn't know that editing an image's attributes was going to be a problem
[10:30:49] <ankurk_> only difference in my case is I am using bootstrap dropdown
[10:30:55] <th3m1773n> Because otherwise, I have a fully functional thing going!
[10:31:16] <th3m1773n> duch_kazatel: ok gtg, thanks for all your help and advice =)
[10:31:53] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ ah, you mean building out the filter string?
[10:32:07] <duch_kazatel> isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering.html#combination-filters
[10:32:19] <ankurk_> basically yeah combining filters
[10:33:16] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ i’d build a string and then pass that to a method that calls the filter method.
[10:34:30] <ankurk_> any example you might have of that>?
[10:34:57] <duch_kazatel> i can try to come up with one i suppose.
[10:35:37] <ankurk_> that would be helpful since my brain is fried
[10:36:01] <ankurk_> you can check out my filterRow function in the bin
[10:36:08] <duch_kazatel> i’m not going to do that part ;)
[10:36:31] <duch_kazatel> i’m looking at how to build the string that gets passed around.
[10:37:09] <jphase> th3m1773n: hey man, sorry was on a conference call
[10:39:36] <ankurk_> No I meant if that needs some refactoring :P
[10:39:51] <dwarder> how do i get random boolean value?
[10:40:10] <dwarder> Math.random() >= 0.5;   ?
[10:41:22] <BillCriswell> dwarder: Have you tried it?
[10:41:34] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ isn’t not perfect, but it might look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/XAy3H/1/
[10:42:22] <dwarder> BillCriswell: yes, it works
[10:47:45] <ankurk_> thanks duch_kazatel :)
[10:53:20] <Skrypter> do you guys prefer jsfiddle over codepen ?
[10:54:32] <BillCriswell> I never really use codepen... I think of that more as a place to show off where fiddle and bin and more places to show someone something.
[10:56:01] <Skrypter> so more portfolio-esque than question and answer-ish?
[10:56:10] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:56:17] <Skrypter> i can see that.
[10:56:24] <jcutrell> I think codepen works just fine for showing something.
[10:56:36] <jcutrell> In fact, I like it much better than a fiddle, as it will autorun js as you change things.
[10:56:42] <jcutrell> You can stay more in the editor.
[10:56:57] <BillCriswell> jcutrell: Yeah, that's why I prefer jsbin to fiddle.
[10:57:19] <Skrypter> they have pretty much the exact same features though
[10:57:22] <BillCriswell> So many times I'll think someone isn't working when updating someones fiddle but really I just forgot to click run.
[10:57:22] <Skrypter> right?
[10:57:44] <BillCriswell> Codepen seems to win on the features front.
[10:58:57] <BillCriswell> Codepen has like support for Sass, SCSS Less, etc; jsbin has Less, jsfiddle has SCSS
[10:59:29] <BillCriswell> Actually, jsbin might have more JS options than codepen now that I'm looking.
[10:59:58] <BillCriswell> Guess it depends what you want to do.
[11:01:27] <duch_kazatel> i prefer fiddle because i’m used to hitting ctrl+enter when wanting to run stuff anyway
[11:01:34] <duch_kazatel> and i don’t want it to run shit until i say so.
[11:02:30] <duch_kazatel> but i’m a weird control freak about things so meh
[11:02:57] <Skrypter> i'm ocd about everything on my setup
[11:07:24] <BillCriswell> I like the autorun, but I really my ability to disable it.
[11:09:06] <Skrypter> is there a good sass/scss IRC channel
[11:09:18] <BillCriswell> #sass?
[11:09:37] <BillCriswell> I'm in there usuall... not much again but then again not too many questions.
[11:09:56] <Skrypter> cool
[11:14:36] <Cyclohexane> thanks thezanke BillCriswell finally got it to work how i wanted it to :)
[11:14:54] <BillCriswell> Cyclohexane: Sweeeet
[11:15:02] <thezanke> Cyclohexane, awesomee ^_^
[11:15:14] <ankurk_> If I add :visible to my selector in the function, filters work as intended. http://jsfiddle.net/J9Aj2/ but it fails when I select the same filter again -__-
[11:15:47] <ankurk_> reason, is it will try to filter only those items that are visible
[11:16:17] <ankurk_> but how do I add the condition that if same filter is selected, filter from hidden items as well?
[11:17:58] <abailarri> I added plupload to my web with exactly this code http://www.plupload.com/examples/ui
[11:18:07] <abailarri> but in my case not appears the widget
[11:18:17] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: I'm having a hard time following. Are you trying to store like.. a reference to the divs that were hidden previously?
[11:18:30] <duch_kazatel> abailarri did you include the plugin on your page?
[11:18:42] <abailarri> yeas, the plupload css and js
[11:18:52] <duch_kazatel> and you included jquery?
[11:18:58] <BillCriswell> I want to make a "pupload" plugin now.
[11:19:05] <ankurk_> yep I am trying to store a reference
[11:19:16] <abailarri> yes 10.1
[11:19:18] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell genius idea.
[11:19:31] <duch_kazatel> abailarri then it’s hard to help without seeing a fiddle demonstrating what you’ve done.
[11:19:42] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, now I see you
[11:19:46] <abailarri> I'm preparing
[11:20:09] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: No matter what image you upload, it returns a picture of a puppy.
[11:20:19] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell and the icons are all puppies
[11:21:01] <BillCriswell> I wonder if facebook will buy us out.
[11:21:52] <duch_kazatel> $25 billion
[11:22:32] <BillCriswell> I think I could part with it for that.
[11:22:42] <abailarri> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/t6qeq/1/
[11:24:59] <duch_kazatel> abailarri it needs jquery ui.
[11:25:11] <abailarri> yes?
[11:25:24] <duch_kazatel> so include jquery uil.
[11:25:32] <duch_kazatel> *ui
[11:25:37] <walidvb> hey guys, you know of an IRC tumblr channel?
[11:25:44] <walidvb> going crazy on their shitty doc
[11:26:20] <BillCriswell> walidvb: Not that I'm aware of... Is it a liquid issue?
[11:26:30] <walidvb> BillCriswell: liquid?
[11:26:39] <walidvb> like it's giving me diarhea?
[11:26:40] <walidvb> yes.
[11:27:51] <abailarri> yes duch_kazatel with jquery UI works fine!
[11:29:18] <BillCriswell> walidvb: I might be able to help.. but I thnk tumblrs docs are pretty good.
[11:29:37] <walidvb> BillCriswell: that'd be nice
[11:29:48] <walidvb> i just finally found out about the block:more
[11:30:23] <walidvb> is there any way to have the "two weeks ago" format _and_ the date format, according to when the post was posted?
[11:30:55] <walidvb> and how can I know if I'm in a post page or not?
[11:32:53] <BillCriswell> walidvb: http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#dates -- seems you can just use two {block:Date}s
[11:33:58] <walidvb> BillCriswell: that'll display both dates, though. idea was to have relative time for past month, and dates for earlier
[11:34:27] <BillCriswell> walidvb: {block:IndexPage} and {block:PermalinkPage} respectively.
[11:34:49] <ocx_> duch_kazatel: something like $('#pushEnabled').val(isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off').change();   change()... and then define a div id=#pushEnabled in body after all these
[11:34:52] <walidvb> BillCriswell: i'm starting to feel real stupid
[11:35:09] <Toaster_Strudel> http://jsfiddle.net/Zb7h5/21/  << what did I do wrong here? I want to click "fixes" and expand the table below...
[11:35:12] <walidvb> i think i was angry already when i started reading the doc, i've overlooked that..
[11:35:13] <BillCriswell> walidvb: No reason.. had to good a bit for that!
[11:35:33] <BillCriswell> Oh it is on the documentation page.
[11:36:21] <walidvb> BillCriswell: it is
[11:36:28] <walidvb> what is block:PostSummary though?
[11:37:10] <BillCriswell> walidvb: No idea. I'm just familiar with liquid a bit, not so much tumblr.
[11:37:19] <walidvb> what's liquid?
[11:37:38] <BillCriswell> It's the language tumblr uses ( I think? )
[11:37:59] <walidvb> oh ok
[11:38:05] <walidvb> i didn't know they used another engine
[11:38:08] <BillCriswell> I might just be wrong.
[11:38:34] <BillCriswell> It looks like a sort of liquid.... as for your date issue I might let javascript do that.
[11:38:47] <walidvb> problem with tumblr is google is useless
[11:38:52] <MikeD_> are you talking about liquid layout or something literally named liquid ?
[11:38:58] <walidvb> anything you search gives you tags results
[11:39:05] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: liquid templating
[11:39:07] <walidvb> MikeD_: 2nd
[11:39:21] <walidvb> i get "cats are liquid"
[11:39:28] <walidvb> that's where my frustration came from
[11:39:31] <walidvb> ..cats
[11:39:41] <MikeD_> i'm already wary and suspicious
[11:40:02] <duch_kazatel> ocx_ huh?  sorry. forgot what the question was.
[11:40:08] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: It's like twig basically if you use PHP.
[11:40:10] <ocx_> Hello, is it fine to declare an eventlistener on some div element, on deviceready m and then define the div afterwards in the body >
[11:40:28] <MikeD_> oh
[11:40:41] <BillCriswell> After further review... it's definitley not liquid here lol
[11:40:42] <duch_kazatel> ocx_ could you setup a fiddle demonstrating it?
[11:41:14] <BillCriswell> walidvb: I'd use JS to go through the dates and do what you need instead of trying to compare dates in tumblrs templating language.
[11:41:30] <walidvb> BillCriswell: lol. was considering that .D
[11:41:35] <MikeD_> ocx_ is deviceready actually triggered after the dom is loaded?  (like document ready)
[11:41:45] <walidvb> i'll check with the designer, just tell her it's not doable
[11:41:50] <walidvb> what a pity though
[11:42:19] <BillCriswell> walidvb: It's doable though, just (only?) doable with JS.
[11:42:41] <walidvb> BillCriswell: yep. i'll think about it some more
[11:43:07] <BillCriswell> walidvb: http://timeago.yarp.com/
[11:43:09] <walidvb> but it wouldn't be too difficult to print the date in a Date format, then use Datejs to change and display it
[11:43:21] <walidvb> or timeago :D
[11:43:55] <walidvb> yay timeago's cdn'ed :)
[11:44:57] <ocx> duch_kazatel: something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/U7E4U/1/
[11:45:09] <ocx> dunno if it can work in jsfiddle since it is loaded in head
[11:45:46] <walidvb> BillCriswell: also, tumblr doesn't provide a tool to dev locally
[11:45:53] <duch_kazatel> ocx - http://i.imgur.com/TOp2zlk.png
[11:45:57] <LinksEz> Is there a way to edit css:after elements in Javascript/Jquery?
[11:46:03] <walidvb> meaning you're supposed to use a sidebar text editor online to dev
[11:46:06] <walidvb> more yay
[11:46:46] <duch_kazatel> ocx so you’re doing binding an event listener to something, then what?
[11:47:03] <ocx> duch_kazatel: then do a console.log if the button is pressed
[11:47:09] <ocx> just want to make sure it works this way
[11:47:25] <ocx> if the eventlistener is defined on a div that is not existant at the time the eventlistenr is created
[11:47:28] <BillCriswell> LinksEz: No. You'd need to alter the class of the element that generates them.
[11:47:38] <BillCriswell> walidvb: Yeah that's no fun.
[11:47:43] <duch_kazatel> ocx no - you can only bind to something that exists.
[11:47:48] <LinksEz> Okay.
[11:48:04] <LinksEz> Thank you beautiful.
[11:48:04] <duch_kazatel> ocx you can either use event delegation, or wait for document ready.
[11:48:05] <MikeD_> ocx: you can use delegation to do what (i think) you want
[11:48:08] <LinksEz> <3
[11:48:32] <ocx> document.ready is called when the document is fully loaded so when the button is created righT?
[11:48:42] <ocx> so if the eventlistener is in doc.ready i sohuld be safe
[11:48:46] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:49:07] <duch_kazatel> document ready is when the document is ready and rendered, but not when everything had “loaded”
[11:49:13] <duch_kazatel> so document ready is safe.
[11:49:15] <BillCriswell> LinksEz: No problem.
[11:50:49] <Bloomberg> hi
[11:51:02] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/bd4e9E26
[11:51:14] <Bloomberg> why this doesn't works on Chrome and safari guys!!
[11:55:28] <walidvb> BillCriswell: do you know if I can conditionnaly load timeago?
[11:55:45] <walidvb> i mean does it suport it out of the box? or do I need to do it myself?
[11:55:58] <BillCriswell> You mean like wrapping it in an if?
[11:56:20] <walidvb> yes
[11:56:47] <walidvb> i mean I need to read and parse the date myself first, then trigger timeago if more than two months ago
[11:57:41] <walidvb> i'll parse it, easy.
[11:57:57] <BillCriswell> As far as I can tell you'd need to do that on your own.
[11:58:04] <walidvb> that's ok
[11:58:07] <walidvb> thx
[11:58:26] <BillCriswell> Moment.js might make that whole thing easier, but in plain JS it shouldn't be that bad.
[11:58:42] <walidvb> nah i'll do it myself, it'll be easy
[12:03:22] <walidvb> I love how designers always use elements that fit their designs perfectly
[12:03:51] <walidvb> and how, after one glimpse at them, you think: well, what if this post has a picture, what if this what if that
[12:04:21] <BillCriswell> walidvb: Yeah, going through that now. Conveniently using one word where up to like 5 can go.
[12:04:29] <walidvb> haha
[12:04:33] <walidvb> exactly
[12:04:48] <walidvb> then coming back to you and telling you "but this should be on one line"
[12:05:03] <walidvb> ......yeah, well don't make 25 chars titles, then...
[12:05:30] <walidvb> and go tell that to your client: "nah, your titles have to be 2 words only else you break the design"
[12:05:30] <duch_kazatel> those are the worst.
[12:05:43] <duch_kazatel> so glad our designers are smarter than that
[12:06:35] <BillCriswell> Having a designer who knows HTML and CSS very well would be pretty amazing. All the designers I ever worked with do not fall into that ccategory
[12:07:00] <duch_kazatel> mosty of ours do.
[12:07:10] <duch_kazatel> they even do functional mockups half the time.
[12:07:12] <duch_kazatel> it’s fucking great.
[12:07:22] <NaN> I'm ussing underscore templates and I need to "find" a div inside my template, I do $(template).find('div').html and it returns me the html but scapted, any help to get the html unscaped?
[12:07:29] <NaN> I need the <% and %> intact
[12:07:55] <duch_kazatel> scapted?
[12:08:26] <walidvb> duch_kazatel: hire me! :)
[12:08:33] <duch_kazatel> walidvb ;)
[12:08:40] <NaN> duch_kazatel: &lt; &gt;
[12:08:42] <BillCriswell> NaN: I'd use <script type="text/template"> instead of an element the browser will try to render.
[12:08:46] <walidvb> I'm happy my designer is very open to knowing more about web practices, and listens to me
[12:08:53] <walidvb> which doesn't mean she knows already
[12:09:16] <NaN> BillCriswell: I need to 'render' to html to find an inner div, if not I will nded another template
[12:09:42] <BillCriswell> NaN: I understand that.
[12:13:39] <BillCriswell> NaN: Maybe you just want .text() instead of .html() ?
[12:14:05] <BillCriswell> NaN: I might just not be following right.
[12:14:09] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[12:16:42] <BillCriswell> NaN: What is template?
[12:17:06] <BillCriswell> Here is what my brain was doing: http://jsbin.com/tivug/3/edit?html,js
[12:18:04] <emx> where do i find the implementation of $( cssSelector ).val()?
[12:18:24] <emx> looking at jquery-2.1.0.js developer formatted
[12:18:40] <systemfault> .val just delegates to .value AFAIK :/
[12:19:06] <duch_kazatel> emx github.
[12:19:20] <duch_kazatel> emx that’s two separate functions though
[12:19:39] <emx> duch_kazatel, a bit more words please :P
[12:19:47] <duch_kazatel> emx huh?
[12:19:57] <BillCriswell> some dots... maybe a path.
[12:19:59] <emx> duch_kazatel, i don't know what you mean by github
[12:20:09] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery github
[12:20:10] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jquery/jquery · GitHub → https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[12:20:16] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[12:20:26] <NaN> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/eFL84/
[12:20:48] <emx> duch_kazatel, and what should i look for?
[12:21:07] <duch_kazatel> emx let’s clarify - why are you interested in it?
[12:21:39] <emx> duch_kazatel, i'm curious how it is implemented
[12:21:49] <emx> just a conceptional thing
[12:21:55] <duch_kazatel> which part?  the .val()?
[12:22:00] <emx> yes
[12:22:05] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/val.js
[12:22:14] <duch_kazatel> that should be it.
[12:23:26] <emx> duch_kazatel, that's exactly it. thanks. why is the directory "blob" not visible but only build, src and test?
[12:23:49] <BillCriswell> NaN: Not sure there's a good way to approach that.
[12:24:21] <haemly> Hello guys, Im working with SVG, and I have two paths. I do not want these paths to create a closed shape. However, I need to close the path, because when I create the second path if the first one is not closed, it continues from the point of the last one
[12:24:23] <haemly> Ideas?
[12:25:28] <BillCriswell> NaN: If that's an absolutely necessary thing to do you could look into changing changing the _.templateSettings.interpolate to /\{\{(.+?)\}\}/g and using {{ foo }} instead of <%= foo %>
[12:25:38] <BillCriswell> Since it wouldn't need to encode the {.
[12:27:11] <duch_kazatel> emx hrm?
[12:28:17] <duch_kazatel> anybody ever run into a case where you fire off an ajax request, watch it run, see that you get 200 back from the server, but the request seems to hang and never complete?

[12:30:45] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell : man are you there?
[12:30:59] <emx> i see
[12:31:17] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Yes.
[12:32:22] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/ReMP9/
[12:32:33] <Bloomberg> Why this event doesn't works on chrome?
[12:32:35] <Bloomberg> you know
[12:33:30] <ngharo> iirc you want a 'change' event, not option.click
[12:33:45] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg use change instead of click.
[12:33:51] <ngharo> change event bound to the <select> that is
[12:34:17] <BillCriswell> Yes. What everyone said haha.
[12:34:21] <duch_kazatel> >:D
[12:34:25] <Bloomberg> whar happen is with change event i need to change the option
[12:34:31] <Bloomberg> I have two fields
[12:34:34] <Bloomberg> what*
[12:34:39] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg that event fires when the option changes value
[12:34:47] <NaN> BillCriswell: I will try that, thanks :)
[12:34:49] <rahul_> hi, I have json format of google image custom search api. How do I get 4 images link from the json format ?
[12:35:13] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ rahul_
[12:35:13] <b-ot> rahul_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:35:16] <Bloomberg> one field is datepicker and the another field is a select drop down
[12:35:53] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg use the change event and make sure you’re binding from within a doc ready
[12:36:43] <Bloomberg> if I select one date and then one option from select works ok, but if then I need to change the date again doesn't works until I change the option select again
[12:36:50] <Bloomberg> understand me?
[12:37:00] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg paste a
[12:37:04] <duch_kazatel> *a more complete fiddle.
[12:37:18] <Bloomberg> duch_kazatel : can I inbox
[12:37:22] <duch_kazatel> no.

[12:38:16] <Bloomberg> ok, so I'm going to show you the complete script
[12:38:53] <rahul_> b-ot: here http://jsfiddle.net/SGRDZ/ is my json file. How do i get all the link corresponding to "src" in array "cse_image" ?
[12:38:53] <b-ot> rahul_: without a doubt.
[12:38:57] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/Hk6Jc/
[12:39:05] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ b-ot is a bot.
[12:39:33] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg please make a small test case of just html and javascript.  your php won’t work in a fiddle.
[12:39:33] <dave_s_> Okay, I have a bit of a problem. I have a multi-step import form. After the file is uploaded, the user maps these fields from the file to the DB columns. Once done, this data is sent to the server for processing (PHP). When that happens, I use setInterval() to call an ajax function that calls the backend which returns progress information for the file.
[12:40:02] <dave_s_> The problem is that the Ajax calls to update the progress are piling up in my console, and never completing.
[12:40:44] <duch_kazatel> dave_s_ you should stop all timers during a request if you’re going to do that.
[12:40:57] <dave_s_> duch_kazatel: What do you mean?
[12:41:05] <systemfault> setInterval should die...
[12:41:09] <duch_kazatel> you sure?
[12:41:14] <dave_s_> Why?
[12:42:12] <dave_s_> duch_kazatel: The request to the server that passes the column map needs to stay active until the server finishes processing the requst.
[12:42:13] <systemfault> dave_s_: What if the server lags and take more than a second to return the response?
[12:42:32] <systemfault> dave_s_: There’s a possibility that the order of the ajax transaction will be messed up
[12:42:35] <BillCriswell> Impossible. It's running Windows ME.
[12:42:37] <rahul_> bot: help
[12:42:48] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ bot isn’t an actual person.  he cannot help you.
[12:42:52] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ that JSON is invalid.
[12:43:08] <dave_s_> systemfault: I'm calling setInterval on a 5 second delay. I could add a variable that causes it not to call the progress update endpoint until the last request completes.
[12:43:20] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: how ?
[12:43:28] <systemfault> dave_s_: Or just do a normal async loop using setTimeout :/
[12:43:51] <dave_s_> systemfault: Can you explain please?
[12:43:52] <systemfault> dave_s_: But anyway, what’s happening on the server? Is it returning a response right away?
[12:44:01] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ where’d you get this from?
[12:44:34] <dave_s_> systemfault: The server is my local machine right now. And no, when I'm not processing the import, the progress update endpoint returns progress data immediately.
[12:44:47] <rahul_> I got it google custom inage restful api.
[12:44:53] <rahul_> *image
[12:45:14] <dave_s_> When I have the Ajax call to pass the column data and process the import going, the progress updates seem to be waiting for the main ajax call to complete before doing anything at all.
[12:45:18] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ look at cse_image - you’re missing a comma after the previous property, and cse_image is an array, not an object, so it’s not going to have properties.
[12:45:25] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ can you try to copy the data again?
[12:45:43] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ or provide a link to where you go the data?
[12:46:58] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: here it is "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?q=lion&cx=011866168012208800368%3A7jsrz6ewg6u&key=AIzaSyAPWdGQw4t1a2271gs74jgCAFXWoV_sbJE"
[12:47:08] <systemfault> dave_s_: Do you have a pastebin or something? It shouldn’t wait for the main ajax to finish..
[12:47:55] <dave_s_> systemfault: I can paste the code. It won't be functional like a JSBin because of all the extra stuff going on.
[12:48:28] <systemfault> dave_s_: Try pasting the relevant part.. just to give an idea of what you’re doing
[12:48:36] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ this is not the same as the original thing you pasted, fyi.
[12:49:02] <BillCriswell> Doesn't matter make it wokr.
[12:49:29] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: sorry, How can I get the images link corresponding to "src".?
[12:50:15] <dave_s_> systemfault: http://pastebin.com/b6yXaCew
[12:50:38] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ http://jsfiddle.net/SGRDZ/1/
[12:51:13] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ i’d go read up on javascript basics - that’s accessing object properties and arrays and stuff.  pretty easy.
[12:51:24] <guideX> How do you pass through a iframe click event cross domain?
[12:51:43] <guideX> for instgance, I want the div above an iframe to pass through the click and hover events
[12:52:15] <BillCriswell> guideX: The only way I could think of is pointer-events: none;
[12:52:17] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: I tried to get it through ajax call using jquery but find difficulties in nested format.
[12:52:35] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ huh?
[12:52:39] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ pretty simple still.
[12:52:55] <guideX> BillCriswell: the problem is, I'm using iscroll, and on iphone, when trying to move the page, you can't move the page if you're on the iframe
[12:53:22] <guideX> pointer-events:none on the div on top takes away that fix, but pointer-events:none on the iframe prevents play
[12:53:29] <guideX> or hover
[12:53:41] <systemfault> dave_s_: How does the server handles the checkImportProgress if the upload hasn’t started yet?
[12:54:03] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ - http://jsfiddle.net/w2Pr5/
[12:54:07] <duch_kazatel> pretty simple stuff.
[12:54:19] <BillCriswell> guideX: Yeah, I've dealt with that with google maps. I can't think of a good way around it. I just try to add a gutter and remove some height.
[12:54:24] <dave_s_> systemfault: By the time this stuff is going on, the file has already been uploaded. The file name is passed around the script so that when the column map gets to the server, it knows which file to use.
[12:54:32] <BillCriswell> so it's less to get in the way of your page scrolling.
[12:54:35] <dave_s_> The file is uploaded in step 1
[12:54:44] <dave_s_> Step 2 maps the fields.
[12:54:52] <dave_s_> step 3 is the progress bar
[12:56:10] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: could you help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/UwHxq/50/ . How do i get yahoo.com using ajax call ?
[12:56:21] <guideX> BillCriswell: that'd work good on google maps, but for video not much.. one thing I got working for pc was, using the autoplay=1 through the ifframe, but there's no autoplay for iphone
[12:56:26] <alaing> duch_kazatel: Hi
[12:56:37] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ huh?  there’s no ajax in there.
[12:56:41] <guideX> so I replace the whole iframe with an iframe with autoplay=1, and it works great on pc, but not on mobile :((
[12:56:45] <BillCriswell> guideX: Sounds like a blast. =(
[12:56:51] <guideX> I was SOOO close!!
[12:57:41] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ i showed you the basics.  could you perhaps explain what it is you want to do?  why are you trying to do it?
[12:57:53] <duch_kazatel> hi alaing
[12:58:01] <alaing> duch_kazatel: you alright?
[12:58:14] <duch_kazatel> alaing yeah.  pretty great today actually :)
[12:58:28] <alaing> cause its Friday ? :-D
[12:58:34] <BillCriswell> They get to you about the promotion?
[12:58:47] <duch_kazatel> nah, i wish.  birthday celebratin’ this weekend.
[12:58:53] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: I am just trying to get the nested data.
[12:58:56] <duch_kazatel> well a little.  i think my wife is planning something for me.
[12:59:02] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ why are you doing that?
[12:59:03] <alaing> nice one, your birthday?
[12:59:07] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[12:59:32] <alaing> Happy birthday for whenever it is
[12:59:38] <alaing> what you doing on here then :-D
[12:59:49] <duch_kazatel> thank you :) technically it’s next wednesday, but we’re celebrating this weekend.
[12:59:57] <duch_kazatel> and I’m at work, like usual :)
[13:00:13] <alaing> I love having early birthday party
[13:00:21] <alaing> thats carp
[13:00:30] <rahul_> duch_kazatel: I am getting familiar with jquery, ajax javasript, and stuck in getting nested json data.
[13:00:32] <duch_kazatel> nah.  not really.  i love my job and my employer.
[13:00:48] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ you treat it like any other object.
[13:01:29] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ the issue is you’re asking how to access a specific thing, but that doesn’t tell me what you’re really trying to do - how I access that data may change my approach
[13:02:38] <duch_kazatel> rahul_ also, http://jsfiddle.net/UwHxq/50/ this isn’t valid JSON again.
[13:02:49] <duch_kazatel> bbiab lunch
[13:03:39] <rahul_> i am trying to get value of "src" and trying to append to my html file <ul> tag.
[13:05:27] <alaing> rahul_: not valid JSON
[13:05:36] <dave_s_> systemfault: I think there is something with Apache only processing 1 request at a time or something.
[13:10:59] <thedjb> any ideas on best way to consume a REST API call via ajax that does NOT return JSON (returns plain text)
[13:11:42] <duch_lunch> thedjb what does the data look like?
[13:12:02] <duch_lunch> because ajax is still the way to go imo.
[13:12:07] <systemfault> dave_s_: That would be insane :(
[13:12:34] <systemfault> thedjb: That would be insane :(
[13:12:52] <NoiseEee> thedjb: pray?
[13:13:44] <thedjb> heh
[13:14:03] <thedjb> the data just returns true or false in plain text
[13:14:15] <NoiseEee> thedjb: so just .responseText the result
[13:14:16] <thedjb> i have no control over it, 3rd party api
[13:15:18] <thedjb> NoiseEee: what method to consume
[13:16:06] <thedjb> $.get ?
[13:16:11] <NoiseEee> thedjb: sure
[13:17:16] <thedjb> and set dataType to html i suppose
[13:18:07] <c0mrade_> I was testing jquery ajax on localhost and after publishing the content online it's no longer working.
[13:18:15] <c0mrade_> webserver is apache using php 5
[13:19:15] <NoiseEee> thedjb: probably to text
[13:19:54] <NoiseEee> c0mrade_: same origin policy is respected, ie: the ajax domain is same as website domain?
[13:20:19] <c0mrade_> Oh wait.
[13:20:26] <c0mrade_> I didn't put the jquery file
[13:20:26] <c0mrade_> :P
[13:20:44] <holywarprofiteer> Hi, so I'm trying to send values to an ajax page, via post, and I've been using data: $('input').serializeArray() to take care of all that, but it doesn't pick up stuff like textareas. Is there a better way? Or a way to add to that once it's serialized?
[13:21:11] <dave_s_> systemfault: But the fact remains that it's happening. :(
[13:21:31] <thedjb> thanks
[13:21:54] <systemfault> dave_s_: You could try moving your setInterval loop after the actually ajax call
[13:22:12] <systemfault> dave_s_: Your problem might be server related though
[13:23:53] <bengalo> Nur der HSV!
[13:28:32] <rgk_> hey i have a question, im using jquery get and it will not grab the jsonp data, any idea what im doing wrong?
[13:29:57] <rgk_> http://paste2.org/N5eJhJZz
[13:30:11] <rgk_> i don't recieve an alert even though the page is recieving the data
[13:30:21] <rgk_> i was a echo and a json_encode php script on the otherside
[13:30:25] <rgk_> i use a*
[13:30:49] <NoiseEee> rgk_: show us the rendered script, not with PHP variables
[13:31:34] <rgk_> 1 second
[13:32:42] <rgk_> NoiseEee: looking at chrome dev network tab the response is empty
[13:32:49] <NoiseEee> rgk_: show us the rendered script, not with PHP variables
[13:33:04] <NoiseEee> what's the rendered JS from your paste?  ie: VIEW SOURCE
[13:34:37] <rgk_> curl "http://live1.brownrice.com/cam-control-dev/jsonp.php?callback=?&camera=sugarbeach1&preset=13&ptz=true" -H "Accept: */*" -H "Referer: http://live1.brownrice.com/clients/sugarbeach.html" -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/33.0.1750.154 Safari/537.36" --compressed
[13:34:46] <rgk_> NoiseEee: sorry didn't think that was so long
[13:35:22] <NoiseEee> rgk_: I am asking what http://paste2.org/N5eJhJZz is when its actually in your browser, php parsed.
[13:36:00] <rgk_> NoiseEee: it would be the first url above
[13:36:13] <rgk_> cam-control-dev/jsonp.php
[13:37:10] <rgk_> it gets sent but when i return with jsonp data it ignores
[13:37:32] <rgk_> the function (data) contents are ignored
[13:38:19] <rgk_> NoiseEee: http://paste2.org/fMHfBytA
[13:38:29] <rgk_> each php variable being just a number
[13:38:38] <rgk_> possibly negative
[13:39:40] <Yllal> How can I only make the Menu1, Menu2 and all the Subs toggeable? If I press a link now it toggles too. (http://jsfiddle.net/K6TSv/2480/)
[13:40:32] <NoiseEee> rgk_: if your response tab is empty, sounds like a backend error
[13:40:44] <rgk_> what would that mean?
[13:40:57] <NoiseEee> well it means PHP isn't outputting anything
[13:41:00] <NoiseEee> so investigate why
[13:41:13] <rgk_> ok thanks
[13:43:05] <NaN> rgk_: do you work for brownrice?
[13:43:28] <rgk_> yes
[13:44:26] <NaN> rgk_: may I priv msg?
[13:44:31] <NaN> *you
[13:44:35] <rgk_> sure
[13:54:11] <dave_s_> systemfault: It was PHP sessions. They're blocking aparently (exclusive file-system locks)
[13:54:32] <systemfault> Ah :/
[13:54:44] <systemfault> Glad you found the issue :P
[13:56:16] <Yllal> Does anyone know why I press on for instance 'Link1' that 'Sub1' disappears?
[13:56:22] <Yllal> http://jsfiddle.net/K6TSv/2480/
[13:57:39] <NoiseEee> Yllal: bad html doesn't help things at all
[13:57:57] <NoiseEee> Yllal: generate valid markup, then try again
[14:01:47] <duch_lunch> woops.
[14:02:08] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle should yell about invalid markup.
[14:03:05] <mordof> http://jsbin.com/hogovuta/1/     i know this won't work, because the deferred isn't set before the return properly. my question is: is there any sane way i *can* get this to work?
[14:03:55] <mordof> well
[14:03:59] <duch_kazatel> Yllal please clean up your HTML first/.  it is not valid.
[14:04:02] <mordof> nevermind i just figured it out
[14:04:11] <Yllal> duch_kazatel: What is wrong with it?
[14:04:28] <duch_kazatel> Yllal you cannot have <div> as a direct descendent of <ul>
[14:04:42] <Yllal> <duch_kazatel> I deleted those now
[14:04:43] <mordof> can't have a <ul> as a direct descendant of a <ul> either
[14:04:51] <mordof> only <li>
[14:04:56] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:06:53] <mordof> Yllal: i would suggest removing the divs altogether, and then after nesting the uls inside their appropriate li's, use ul li ul::before { }  to create those arrows
[14:08:30] <Yllal> mordof: I have it like tihs now http://jsfiddle.net/K6TSv/2483/ , removed all the divs, but the validator doesn't say anything abotu the uls
[14:08:34] <mordof> or just use a background image on the a elements for the ones that have subnavs
[14:10:00] <mordof> Yllal: it is too complaining about it. i just double checked
[14:10:28] <mordof> Yllal: you need to supply it with a properly formatted document (doctype, header, structure) before it will inform you about the errors of the body content
[14:10:43] <mordof> Yllal: since before you do that, it doesn't know how to interpret what you're giving it.
[14:10:44] <Yllal> mordof: Aha I see, that was the only error I had :p
[14:11:03] <duch_kazatel> mordof jsfiddle tells you do not include a doctype, etc, doesn’t it?
[14:11:17] <mordof> Yllal: http://apaste.info/neb  try validating that with validator.w3.org
[14:11:29] <mordof> duch_kazatel: right - it takes care of that for you. i'm referring to when validating, not jsfiddle
[14:11:47] <mordof> Yllal: and i'm referring to the contents (copy and paste direct input), not the url
[14:12:25] <mordof> woops i forgot the html tag opening.. oh well
[14:12:40] <mordof> it doesn't seem to complain about that, heh
[14:12:43] <Yllal> mordof: Got the errors anyways ;)
[14:12:53] <Yllal> mordof: Willl try to fix these first!
[14:13:29] <mordof> Yllal: if you did it by URL, the errors won't be yours, but will be related to apaste
[14:13:46] <Yllal> mordof: Nope, did it by direct input
[14:13:50] <mordof> ok
[14:13:53] <RedSkyDown2> hi. I have an error like : $.cookie is not a function. The cookie plugin is loaded. it work on all page except one. any idea why?
[14:14:15] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: my guess is you did something different on that page, or broke something
[14:14:24] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: if it worked elsewhere, then the plugin functions
[14:15:03] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: possibly forgot to include the plugin on that page
[14:15:40] <RedSkyDown2> mordof: I will not post error here if I didnt check everything before.
[14:16:18] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: well.. you didn't provide any examples, and the situation you're describing sounds very specific to that reason. simply asking for my guess - that's what it is
[14:16:41] <RedSkyDown2> as I work in locale, its hard to provide exemple
[14:16:41] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: until you actually show us the error, or give us something to work with, the only thing we can do is guess
[14:17:40] * mordof can't do anything to help you without one...
[14:19:21] <RedSkyDown2> found it. jquery was load 2 time
[14:19:45] <mordof> ah - so the second jquery was probably overwriting the first, with the first being the instance that had loaded the plugin
[14:19:54] <RedSkyDown2> yeah
[14:20:04] <mordof> definitely wouldn't have guessed that
[14:20:29] <RedSkyDown2> you should have :P
[14:20:50] <duch_kazatel> RedSkyDown2 it’s pretty safe to assume you’d only load jquery once.
[14:20:51] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: sorry, i'll work on my powers of divination and seeing through the internet magically so they can get better for the next time
[14:21:07] <RedSkyDown2> ;)
[14:21:12] <mordof> :p
[14:21:16] <RedSkyDown2> thank anyway ;)
[14:21:27] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: next time - at least a copy/paste of the page in question would be a start
[14:21:33] <mordof> not in the channel - but a link to a pastebin with it
[14:22:03] <RedSkyDown2> mordof: if it could be possible lol. I cannot past code on internet like I want where I work.
[14:22:22] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: you can't load up pastebin.com or some other website and copy and paste bits of code?
[14:22:38] <duch_kazatel> RedSkyDown2 you can create test cases, though
[14:22:59] <RedSkyDown2> duch_kazatel: if I create test case, it mean I know where is the problem ;)
[14:23:00] <mordof> also true.. not quite relevant in this specific scenario however
[14:23:09] * mordof nods
[14:23:20] <mordof> since it's page-specific, there's something wrong on the page, and recreating most likely fixes it
[14:23:31] <duch_kazatel> RedSkyDown2 sometimes, working through the problem that way can help you track it down.
[14:23:38] <mordof> also true
[14:23:40] <duch_kazatel> it’s half the reason i ask for them.
[14:23:41] <mordof> heh
[14:23:44] <RedSkyDown2> anyway. its fixed
[14:23:55] <Yllal> mordof: Fixed my code: http://jsfiddle.net/K6TSv/2485/
[14:24:17] <mordof> duch_kazatel: i had the hardest time explaining that to a classmate :/ he's like "but it takes so much longer, and why would i write more code? i don't understand"
[14:24:20] * mordof sighs
[14:24:50] <mordof> well...
[14:24:50] <duch_kazatel> if it takes you that much longer and that’s such a big problem, don’t be a programmer ;)
[14:24:59] <mordof> duch_kazatel: haha, yeah - he's just learning though
[14:25:05] <mordof> lots of assignments currently
[14:25:06] * mordof shrugs
[14:25:15] <mordof> Yllal: well.... it's *valid* at least now, but that's not the structure you want
[14:25:27] <mordof> Yllal: doing it like that, you've lost the knowledge of which ul is a child of which li
[14:26:01] <mordof> Yllal: things like hovers and expands and whatnot won't work the same way with that structure
[14:26:23] <Yllal> mordof: Hmm yeah, found that out with the toggle thing I'm trying to do
[14:26:31] <Yllal> mordof: It toggles the wrong things
[14:27:16] <mordof> http://jsfiddle.net/K6TSv/2486/   <-- this is what you're looking for
[14:27:51] <mordof> geez 2486 revisions
[14:28:22] <Yllal> mordof: Not all mine :P
[14:28:45] <Yllal> I accidentally used the jsfiddle of someone else for mine haha
[14:28:53] <mordof> hm
[14:29:04] <mordof> that could cause complications..
[14:29:30] <mordof> http://jsfiddle.net/r8yab/  use this from now on
[14:29:47] <mordof> see the "Fork" button up top, that's what it's for... it creates a copy with a new id
[14:29:55] <Yllal> mordof: Thanks, I will
[14:30:10] <Yllal> mordof: Aha I see it, thanks
[14:30:31] <mordof> so.. now that that's all sorted out. what's the initial problem? lol
[14:30:36] <mordof> i wasn't here for that
[14:31:12] <Yllal> mordof: Well I'm trying to use a toggle menu, but I don't really know how to write javascript for it
[14:31:36] <Yllal> mordof: I want all the Subs to be toggeable, and the Links not, but if I press on a Link now it toggles too
[14:31:42] <mordof> so you want all child ul's to be hidden until the main link gets clicked?
[14:32:03] <Yllal> mordof: Yeah actually that
[14:36:28] <mordof> http://jsfiddle.net/r8yab/2/
[14:36:31] <RedSkyDown2> what. now I have event mouse over on all link, I have no mouse over event anywhere :|
[14:36:42] <mordof> heh
[14:37:51] <mordof> ah that won't work right, hold on Yllal
[14:38:11] <mordof> well, it "works" because the other a tags have no siblings
[14:38:17] <mordof> but if you changed that structure it would hide those
[14:38:29] <Yllal> mordof: Ah, I see
[14:38:46] <mordof> Yllal: http://jsfiddle.net/r8yab/3/  makes sure the sibling is a ul
[14:38:56] <RedSkyDown2> is there a way with firefox to stop on first js event?
[14:39:32] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: either put something in your code, or put a breakpoint in the dev tools
[14:39:46] <duch_kazatel> “first js event” meaning...?
[14:39:50] <Yllal> mordof: Hmm, the previous version works better
[14:39:51] <mordof> both require knowing where the first event fires from though\
[14:39:58] <mordof> Yllal: they work the same...
[14:40:00] <RedSkyDown2> I want to know what is the next line of code executed lol.
[14:40:21] <Yllal> mordof: I was looking in the wrong jsfiddle *bump*
[14:40:21] <duch_kazatel> RedSkyDown2 your question doesn’t make sense.
[14:40:22] <duch_kazatel> clarify.
[14:40:25] <Yllal> mordof: Sorry :p
[14:40:51] <RedSkyDown2> I pass my mouse over any link, the page became white.
[14:40:53] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: are you trying to find out waht line of code follows after the event is executed?
[14:41:00] <mordof> outside the event
[14:41:03] <mordof> ?
[14:41:21] <RedSkyDown2> I dont know what cause that. :/
[14:41:33] * mordof attempts to practice his divination
[14:41:35] <RedSkyDown2> I just remove duplicate jquery
[14:41:38] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: it's the gremlins
[14:41:41] <mordof> RedSkyDown2: the ball told me so
[14:41:43] <Yllal> mordof: So the first line hides all the uls children from the beginning and the second line toggles the children if a parent is clicked?
[14:42:34] <mordof> Yllal: line three watches all a tags for when they get clicked. if they get clicked, then the next sibling of that anchor tag (the ul that's beside the a) will toggle (if it's visible, it'll .hide(), if it's hidden, it'll .show())
[14:42:56] <mordof> hmmm
[14:43:28] <Yllal> mordof: Aha I see, thanks for the help
[14:44:15] <mordof> hmmm
[14:44:23] <mordof> Yllal: i don't like that... all links will still fire
[14:45:01] <mordof> Yllal: http://jsfiddle.net/r8yab/6/    there
[14:45:12] <mordof> refined it so that only links that have a sibling ul will even watch for click
[14:45:15] <mordof> oh
[14:45:32] <mordof> http://jsfiddle.net/r8yab/7/   and the return false stops the browser from going anywhere when you click on that
[14:46:00] <duch_kazatel> why not use event delegation and filter on each click instead, as well as use preventDefault() to stop the default event?
[14:46:25] <Yllal> mordof: Aha like that
[14:47:03] <mordof> i'm oldschool and keep forgettign about preventDefault
[14:47:06] <mordof> lol
[14:47:15] <duch_kazatel> and the delegation?
[14:47:25] <mordof> as far as event delegation goes - it's debatable which one would be better in this scenario
[14:47:39] <duch_kazatel> i’d disagree ;)
[14:47:42] <mordof> as it's dependant on the future size of the actual list
[14:47:45] <mordof> how so?
[14:47:58] <duch_kazatel> instead of conditionally binding listeners, you bind one. take the magic out of what’s getting bound.
[14:48:22] <mordof> i realize that - bit then you're also firing an event on every click, whether it needs to or not
[14:48:42] <duch_kazatel> the event always fires on every click all ready.
[14:48:52] <mordof> no it doesn't
[14:48:56] <mordof> only on the ones with a sibling ul
[14:49:02] <mordof> it's specific to only the links that need it
[14:49:02] <duch_kazatel> you mean the handler.
[14:49:15] <mordof> the event is only bound to the appropriate links
[14:49:21] <duch_kazatel> the handler is.
[14:49:23] <duch_kazatel> the event will always fire.
[14:49:31] <mordof> huh?
[14:49:43] <duch_kazatel> you’re conflating event listener with the event.
[14:50:31] <mordof> i get that they're different
[14:50:51] <mordof> the listener is only bound to the anchor elements that it needs to be on
[14:50:56] <mordof> so the event only fires when it's appropriate
[14:51:08] <mordof> where as a delegated event fires every time - and conditionally calls the callback
[14:51:27] <mordof> you do the condition logic every click, as opposed to on the initial bind with delegation
[14:51:33] <duch_kazatel> meh, i’s still use a delegated listener and do that magic in my handler, but that’s your call.
[14:51:33] <mordof> er..
[14:53:10] <mordof> it really depends on the situation. if this list were to grow to be very large, delegated events would end up being (relatively) quite a bit slower
[14:53:57] <mordof> but by the same token, if the list were littered with nested lists all over the place and grew to be very large, then the number of event listeners would grow to be quite a number also
[14:55:03] <Yllal> mordof: Got it working now, thanks a lot. I'm off to be now :)
[14:55:23] <mordof> Yllal: cheers
[14:56:32] <mordof> duch_kazatel: delegation is great, but it's certainly not a one-size-fits-all
[14:56:47] <mordof> either way would work in this scenario though
[15:04:24] <bowenac> can someone take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/Y6TjK/3/
[15:04:41] <bowenac> im trying to disable a checkbox if its child input value equals a specific value
[15:04:51] <bowenac> the prop disable is not working
[15:06:47] <decx> this.parent(input) is impossible
[15:07:18] <duch_kazatel> “child input”
[15:07:42] <bowenac> this.parent('.chore-list').find('input')?
[15:08:38] <bowenac> closest there has to be a way to find the parent input
[15:09:06] <jphase> anyone know any reason why this .load chaining would break in IE < 11?  https://infinityrehab.secure.force.com/careers   (lines 5-45 is specifically the ad-hoc stuff I'm dealing with, the rest is someone else's mess)
[15:10:12] <oniMaker> jphase: which part breaks?
[15:10:58] <jphase> oniMaker: well hard to tell since it loads pieces of the site one at a time... in IE < 11 it loads the background image (so I know it's pulling the site header and such) and then the rest just shows up blank, rather odd. I can screenshot it here shortly
[15:11:14] <oniMaker> no console errors?
[15:11:21] <jphase> no, oddly
[15:11:27] <jphase> besides 2 fontface CSS errors
[15:11:32] <jphase> which I don't care about at this point
[15:11:56] <jphase> ssl doesn't have insecure content or any CORS related errors that I see either, those have been resolved
[15:12:27] <oniMaker> hmm, odd
[15:12:38] <oniMaker> I'd put in some console.log() statements to see where the execution is stalling
[15:15:05] <jphase> definitely not a bad idea, here's the two screenshots in IE 10:  http://snag.gy/GPaFC.jpg, http://snag.gy/Z8wOn.jpg
[15:15:44] <oniMaker> sorry, hard to tell without following the execution
[15:16:11] <jphase> oh tell me about it, going to add in some debug messages just to see if it's actually failing on deferred stuff
[15:17:45] <jphase> the hard part is, this is obviously a salesforce template with their funny apex code (and a 3rd party vendor shits out code from their little snippet as well). I had to battle with said company to tell them that their html that was rendering outside of </body></html> was invalid and broke everything IE.
[15:18:03] <jphase> they have since fixed that which got IE 11 working lol
[15:22:07] <jphase> hmm, well it seemingly does all the appending as I see all my console messages.... wth
[15:22:22] <bowenac> so no way to target a input:checkbox using jquery?
[15:22:39] <jphase> bowenac: $('input[type=checkbox]')
[15:23:33] <jphase> or I suppose you don't even need "input" in the selector unless your markup is super funky heh
[15:23:44] <jphase> $('[type=checkbox]') should suffice
[15:23:50] <duch_kazatel> that’ll help speed it up some though.
[15:23:50] <bowenac>      if($(this).val()==num){         alert(num);         $(this).parent("input[type='checkbox']" ).prop("disabled",true);     };
[15:24:08] <jphase> oh touché - duch_kazatel ftw
[15:24:30] <duch_kazatel> in fact, you could probably filter for even better performance.  not sure though.
[15:25:13] <bowenac> right dont need the input just checkbox
[15:25:23] <bowenac> but I have to get the parent checkbox which isnt working
[15:25:39] <duch_kazatel> there is not such thing as a “parent checkbox” of a checkbox.
[15:25:41] <bowenac> if I just do       $("[type='checkbox']" ).prop("disabled",true); yea it works but disables them all haha
[15:25:52] <bowenac> there is only one checkbox
[15:25:52] <duch_kazatel> link to fiddle again?
[15:26:58] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/Y6TjK/6/
[15:28:02] <duch_kazatel> what’s up with the table with a single cell?
[15:28:24] <jphase> bowenac: perhaps you're looking for .parent().children('input[type=checkbox]')  ?
[15:28:52] <duch_kazatel> bowenac what’s up with stuff like “Get up on time<input type="hidden"name="optionName[2]" value="Get up on time">“ ?
[15:28:56] <jphase> oh nvm, chore-list
[15:29:05] <bowenac> yup
[15:29:09] <bowenac> that works though
[15:29:12] <bowenac> without the class lol
[15:29:38] <jphase> yeah you've got some funky html in here
[15:29:46] <bowenac> I am using that hidden feild for getting things from db
[15:29:50] <bowenac> for somewhere else
[15:30:01] <bowenac> those are dynamically added
[15:30:09] <duch_kazatel> bowenac that doesn’t make any sense.  use .data() instead.
[15:30:31] <bowenac> for what
[15:30:37] <bowenac> I dont think you understand how I am using it
[15:30:38] <bowenac> lol
[15:30:57] <duch_kazatel> i have a hard time understanding what you’re doing, period
[15:32:24] <bowenac> for each result from the db I am echoing those input feilds and setting the id, name, image url, etc like $retreived_search->id etc
[15:32:39] <bowenac> which I then use later on
[15:32:57] <bowenac> not sure how using .data would make more sense
[15:33:15] <bowenac> <?php echo "<input type='hidden' value='{$retrieved_search->name}' name='optionName[{$retrieved_search->id}]'>"?>
[15:33:17] <bowenac> like that
[15:33:29] <bowenac> from foreach ($chores as $retrieved_search){
[15:33:35] <duch_kazatel> why are there two inputs though?
[15:34:13] <bowenac> because they hold different values
[15:34:18] <bowenac> and different names
[15:34:32] <bowenac> that is why one is hidden
[15:34:34] * mordof can't figure out why the closing tags are all considered bad in jsfiddle
[15:34:41] <bowenac> I could make it a p tag or any tag...
[15:34:52] <bowenac> just a placeholder
[15:34:58] <duch_kazatel> bowenac still not understanding why you’d do it that way, but ok.
[15:35:12] <bowenac> $chartOptions = $wpdb->prefix . "chartOptions"; $chores = $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM $chartOptions");
[15:35:17] <bowenac> how else would I do it?
[15:35:36] <duch_kazatel> is this for a simple task list of some kind?
[15:36:06] <duch_kazatel> like, what kind of app are you building?
[15:36:36] <bowenac> yes user logs in selects the tasks from the checkboxes, they then get appended to a selected options area when they save I am using those values to insert into a differnt table
[15:37:48] <bowenac> its already built and works great, now I am just trying to make an edit page, loop through current options in the db and disable those checkboxes so they cant add them again... then append that option to the current list area with a delete option
[15:38:01] <hirsty> hey all, I have an iframe that i want to dynamically refresh only if the content changes, how would i do this? - shivers at the word iframe)
[15:38:16] <duch_kazatel> your current design pattern makes no sense, bowenac
[15:38:22] <duch_kazatel> are the tasks predetermined?
[15:38:36] <royalty> hello, is there an elegant way to put mark up in a string and append it to an element, I know I can use .append('throw mark up string here') but line breaks ruin it and I can't throw variables directly in the text
[15:38:37] <bowenac> the list of available tasks are yes
[15:38:40] <royalty> and it looks ugly
[15:38:40] <duch_kazatel> because there are tons of different ways to approach that which are all much cleaner and easier to maintain/
[15:39:02] <krisek101> Hi. I want to save by jquery something data to $_GET. I know that to do it i have to use $.get(url,data,callback); but how can i use it than? An example: I have got 3-steps form and I want to use variables from first step in third step.
[15:39:17] <hirsty> the iframe url is on an external page - currently i am trying tu use $.get and then compare the html from the iframe to the html of the other page
[15:39:34] <mordof> royalty: when i'm being lazy and doing it that way, i do this: http://jsbin.com/pepeqini/1/
[15:39:35] <bowenac> you have an example
[15:39:39] <duch_kazatel> hirsty why are you trying to do it?
[15:40:01] <duch_kazatel> bowenac i have an example of some terribly convoluted frontend code.
[15:40:11] <royalty> mordof: what is that?
[15:40:13] <hirsty> so viewers dont see a constantly refreshing iframe :3
[15:40:21] <mordof> royalty: it's markup to be appended with .append
[15:40:28] <bowenac> I just pasted that into jsfiddle
[15:40:31] <mordof> royalty: it's what you were asking about
[15:40:32] <duch_kazatel> hirsty right, but why do you think you need to refresh it in the first place?
[15:40:38] <bowenac> thats not how it looks exactly in the file
[15:40:38] <duch_kazatel> bowenac go read up on design patterns
[15:40:48] <bowenac> lol ummm mmmkkayyyy
[15:41:03] <bowenac> you obviously have no idea what I am doing... and just have your opinion or assumptions on what I am doing
[15:41:09] <hirsty> it periodically changes  (its for an online radio stations - basically its to change dj info)
[15:41:11] <royalty> mordof: all I see is a blank page... how do I use this tool?
[15:41:23] <mordof> oh what
[15:41:25] <bowenac> and think it shouldnt be done how I am doing it for some apparent reason when it works great and is quick
[15:41:26] <mordof> lol
[15:41:28] <mordof> hold on
[15:41:28] <bowenac> I dont see the problem
[15:41:33] <royalty> lol
[15:41:33] <royalty> ok
[15:41:37] <mordof> royalty: http://jsbin.com/pepeqini/1/edit   i had no idea it did that
[15:41:56] <duch_kazatel> bowenac you have a simple list of predetermined tasks and a list of “selected” tasks, right?
[15:42:00] <hirsty> krisek maybe use a script to hold your data in JSON form?
[15:42:09] <bowenac> not seperate lists
[15:42:11] <bowenac> they are the same
[15:42:20] <bowenac> they get to click on a task from the available options
[15:42:21] <duch_kazatel> so you have one list to display everything?
[15:42:24] <bowenac> its a 3 step process
[15:42:40] <bowenac> if user is logged in they get directed to second step to choose the chores they will be doing
[15:42:54] <royalty> mordof: so I just put my append code there and it works?
[15:43:04] <hirsty> bowernac: what is it your trying to do?
[15:43:12] <mordof> royalty: i'm just showing you how i format my strings when i do markup appends
[15:43:21] <duch_kazatel> hirsty they’ve got a pretty complex backend for a simple CRUD-style display.
[15:43:28] <royalty> mordof: oh I thought you had some neat tool
[15:43:32] <royalty> mordof: lol
[15:43:34] <mordof> royalty: xD
[15:43:43] <mordof> not really
[15:43:53] <hirsty> we got any examples?
[15:43:56] <duch_kazatel> bowenac i’d stll say that’s easily cleaned up.  but do what works for you i guess.
[15:44:00] <duch_kazatel> hirsty don’t worry about it.
[15:44:02] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:44:14] <hirsty> <-- PHP Dev :D but np :P
[15:44:23] <mordof> royalty: unfortunately javascript doesn't support heredocs, or that would work best.
[15:44:27] <royalty> that's still kind of ugly I like how I can do it more cleanly with PHP but whatever
[15:44:31] <royalty> mordof: yeah
[15:45:05] <duch_kazatel> royalty jquery isn’t a templating engine - you’d ned something more suited to that kind of thing instead.
[15:45:36] <royalty> duch_kazatel: yes sir
[15:45:53] <mordof> oh dear.... a stack overflow example of using block comments and then doing function.toString and grabbing the contents of the block comment for a pseudo-heredoc xD
[15:46:04] <bowenac> duch_kazatel here is an example don't mind the design as that is how they want it haha http://adamcbowen.com/demos/cosmetics/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/example.png
[15:46:43] <hirsty> duc_kazatel: http://pastebin.com/HY5Tkc1h
[15:47:16] <hirsty> ooo yay forms >.> lol
[15:47:19] <duch_kazatel> bowenac is this a one and done kind of thing?
[15:47:26] <bowenac> nope
[15:47:30] <bowenac> that is what i am doing now
[15:47:32] <bowenac> they edit it
[15:47:51] <bowenac> thats why I wanted to find the parent checkbox so I can disable it if that chore is in the db for that user
[15:47:55] <duch_kazatel> bowenac i mean, do you fill out the form and call it a day, maybe edit it later,but no scheduling or anything, right?
[15:48:01] <bowenac> and on the left I will put a x over the selcted so they can delete it
[15:48:19] <bowenac> they get reset every night
[15:48:25] <bowenac> from a cron job
[15:48:29] <bowenac> to reset the values
[15:48:35] <bowenac> and send out emails to the parents etc
[15:48:46] <bowenac> but what does that have to do with having two input feilds?
[15:48:53] <duch_kazatel> i’m about to explain :)
[15:48:55] <hirsty> @bowenac: PM :D
[15:49:09] <bowenac> one for checkbox and the other hidden to hold the other values
[15:49:28] <emx> <tag data-Foo='bar' /> <-- why do i have to use $( 'tag' ).data( 'foo' ) to get data for capital F Foo?
[15:50:12] <hirsty> not case insensitive is it?
[15:50:41] <duch_kazatel> I’d make three tables - one of available tasks, one of users, and one of assigned tasks for each user.  instead of the weird data munging you’ve got in your markup, i’d have my backend render things out to the frontend and use the IDs my db is creating to referencing everything instead.
[15:51:00] <duch_kazatel> or store data in sessions or something, instead of in my markup.
[15:51:03] <bowenac> that is exactly how I am doing it lol
[15:51:06] <hirsty> oo mysql ^_^
[15:51:09] <jphase> emx: hirsty is correct, data attributes are lcase
[15:51:21] <emx> hirsty, what i expect is that jQuery respects lowercase/upercase of data identifiers.
[15:51:22] <duch_kazatel> why do you have extra data in your markup, then?
[15:51:37] * hirsty wants a look >.>
[15:51:38] <duch_kazatel> because “holding data” in inputs like that seem svery counterintuitive to me.
[15:52:05] <hirsty> but in any case ill wait :D
[15:52:12] <emx> jphase, does html 5 specify that or does jquery ignore uppercase?
[15:52:32] <jphase> emx: that part I'm uncertain, but I know that data-BLAHBLAH is .data('blahblah')
[15:52:34] <duch_kazatel> hirsty why are you automatically refreshing the iframe?  sorry, i may have missed your answer to that.
[15:52:44] <emx> jphase, k, thanks for clarifying
[15:53:35] <hirsty> Well the DJ alters every x hours and if the visitor is not changing page, im wanting to show the new dj.....working with a rubbish external script for DJ Status >.>
[15:53:47] <duch_kazatel> “dj” ?
[15:54:03] <hirsty> Online Radio DJ
[15:54:09] <bowenac> dude the images are from the available tasks table, I am putting the image url as the value feild of the checkbox so I can use it later, I am also setting the option name as value in the hidden feild
[15:54:21] <bowenac> I guess I could just add another data-something
[15:54:29] <duch_kazatel> bowenac it’t not a big deal, just not the way i would have done it.
[15:54:46] <bowenac> oh thats why
[15:54:56] <hirsty> bowen whats the data issue your having?
[15:54:58] <SmartDev88>  I`m a Web Developer .. PHP CodeIgniter, ASP.NET , CSS , jQuery , HTML .. Searching for a company to work with , online :)
[15:55:18] <bowenac> no data issue
[15:55:20] <duch_kazatel> hirsty http://jsfiddle.net/8jC3B/ - i was questioning why they were structuring their markup this way.
[15:55:22] * hirsty points to a job site :P
[15:55:31] <bowenac> duch_kazatel just didnt like the way I was using two input feilds lol
[15:55:37] <oniMaker> SmartDev88: try some of the *-lance channels
[15:55:48] <oniMaker> SmartDev88: #php-lance #css-lance etc.
[15:56:11] <duch_kazatel> bowenac i also don’t like how you’re tying your HTML to your Data, but meh.  it’s really nbd.
[15:56:13] <SmartDev88> <oniMaker> I`ll try, thank you :)
[15:56:20] <oniMaker> you're welcome
[15:56:56] <duch_kazatel> aw man developer pci compliance testing blows
[15:57:25] <hirsty> ok why have you a hidden text box to every checkbox? :/
[15:57:28] <bowenac> right the main reason I did it like that is so I can use the post values when inserting into the db
[15:57:45] <bowenac> otherwise how would I get multiple $_POST values from the same input
[15:57:56] <duch_kazatel> bowenac so what happens when i manipulate that and inject my own data to your db?
[15:58:07] <bowenac> that is why the name is different on each so I can grab the post value from it
[15:58:11] <hirsty> put the selection values in a database and call from that
[15:58:14] <bowenac> good luck
[15:58:26] <duch_kazatel> bowenac you realize that’s a big security hole, right?
[15:58:30] <duch_kazatel> that’s begging for some injection.
[15:58:35] <hirsty> yup
[15:58:38] <jphase> dear IE, please die in a fire... kthxbye
[15:58:52] <bowenac> using post values to insert into a db?
[15:59:08] <hirsty> as well as letting everyone know "OH! Im a file that lives here!
[15:59:13] <bowenac> you can't even access the file unless your coming from another page and are logged in
[15:59:33] <duch_kazatel> bowenac right.  what happens if i modify the post value to a malicious sql command?
[15:59:54] <hirsty> have you excaped your sql strings for a start?
[16:00:16] <hirsty> escaped*
[16:01:12] <bowenac> sanitize
[16:01:15] <hirsty> if not get prepard for input strings like "'; DELETE * FROM *;
[16:02:19] <duch_kazatel> brb workbeer.
[16:02:32] <bowenac> $data should be unescaped (the function will escape them for you). Keys are columns, Values are values.
[16:02:46] <bowenac> $wpdb->insert( $table, (array) $data )
[16:03:45] <hirsty> so whats stopping a naughty coder DOM editing your values?
[16:04:52] <bowenac> change the value in the dom lol whats that going to do
[16:05:22] <hirsty> eg they could change and input value to a jpg and point it to a script file
[16:05:45] <bowenac> when its in the dom its not accessing the db
[16:05:57] <bowenac> its been retrieved from the db
[16:06:04] <bowenac> just a dyncamic value
[16:06:12] <bowenac> how is that any different than having an image tag on a webpage lol
[16:06:37] <bowenac> I don't have time to explain this to you... thanks as always jphase for the help
[16:07:02] <hirsty> well you could always get nude pics lol
[16:07:11] <hirsty> as well as other stuff but meh :)
[16:07:21] <bowenac> would only be for the user who is logged into that session viewing that page
[16:07:23] <jphase> nude pics!?  O_O
[16:07:26] <jphase> what'd I miss?
[16:07:48] <bowenac> if your not logged in your not viewing that page and those values are only used on that page
[16:07:50] <hirsty> nothing much just bow disregarding DOM editor :D
[16:08:28] <bowenac> besides what 10 year old doesnt like nude pics as that is the target audience hahaha
[16:09:07] <hirsty> bow does your site allow uploads?
[16:09:21] <jphase> 10 year old nudey pics!? :O

[16:11:18] <jphase> well if it's wordpress I'd be happy to assist you in #wordpress :)
[16:11:36] <bowenac> I know your on wordpress channel a bit huh
[16:11:39] <bowenac> as am I lol
[16:11:40] <hirsty> basically have an iframe with an src to an external script basically wanting to do, if the html from that external source is different then reload iframe otherwise do nothing
[16:11:58] <bowenac> I dont need help with anything that was a reply to hirsty asking if it allows uploads haha
[16:12:13] <jphase> hirsty: so there's occurrences of where the iframe src is not external then I'm assuming?
[16:12:41] <hirsty> always wexternal only 1 iframe....hate em
[16:13:10] <hirsty> just need data refreshing if the dj has changed
[16:13:17] <jphase> hirsty: "is different" than what exactly?
[16:13:20] <hirsty> and bow u can upload in wordpress :3
[16:13:30] <bowenac> yup
[16:13:51] <bowenac> if your logged in and have the correct role
[16:14:25] <bowenac> alright im out thanks people
[16:14:36] <hirsty> ok say im on air DJ hirsty......30 mins passes and the on air scrip still show DJ hirsty it wont do anything, but if you go on air and the script catches it, itll replace the html
[16:14:38] <jphase> ciao :)
[16:15:32] <jphase> and you're loading this in an iframe by choice or cause you have no choice or?
[16:15:36] <hirsty> with a fadein and fadeout effect :D
[16:15:49] <hirsty> no choice really >.>
[16:16:18] <hirsty> otherwise i wouldnt use it :D
[16:16:34] <hirsty> cus iframe are terrible i hope they burn <=D
[16:16:38] <hirsty> >=D
[16:16:59] <jphase> hirsty: is that based on the fact that the remote server doesn't allow access from any origin via CORS or?
[16:17:21] <hirsty> no its just the way the script is
[16:17:53] <hirsty> i suppose i could try ajax load it into a div but that could get messy >.>
[16:18:07] <jphase> well if you had the ability to load the content from the remote URL you could just do a .load on a reasonable interval and compare the content I suppose
[16:18:15] <jphase> normally this type of thing I do in node though :\
[16:18:23] <jphase> yeah
[16:18:25] <jphase> hmm
[16:18:30] <hirsty> did u see the pastebin?
[16:18:50] <hirsty> http://pastebin.com/HY5Tkc1h
[16:18:51] <jphase> no, sorry, am in nom'ing on some dinner and was away
[16:19:05] <hirsty> tried to compare lol probs not v well >.>
[16:19:23] <hirsty> as i am after all half asleep :D
[16:19:52] <hirsty> #activedj is my iframe
[16:23:34] <jphase> sec, let me finish some chicken and try something
[16:23:49] <hirsty> lol
[16:30:09] <hirsty> blegh back
[16:34:59] <jphase> okay, almost done with my chicken :)
[16:37:32] <jphase> k, think I have something for you hirsty
[16:37:45] <hirsty> £100? :o
[16:38:21] <jphase> hehe no, but worth a shot ;)
[16:38:28] <hirsty> :P
[16:38:34] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/Gj9t9/1/
[16:39:09] <jphase> that should grab stuff and tell you when it changes every few seconds. feel free to change that and critique it... I had a mouth full of chicken when that was happening
[16:39:18] <jphase> doesn't use iframes at all though, which feels better overall
[16:40:08] <jphase> granted, I don't know when these DJs change and haven't seen a "changed" in the console yet cause DJRockyMtHigh is bogarting the set hehe, but in theory that should work
[16:40:53] <jphase> and "Current DJ" and "Loaded DJ" are mixed up in the console log, my bad
[16:41:42] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/Gj9t9/2/
[16:43:36] <hirsty> to load it on page load i just do it in doc.ready?
[16:43:45] <jphase> yeah
[16:44:09] <jphase> that's also obviously bare bones so you'll need to do whatever you want when it actually changes
[16:44:18] <hirsty> <3
[16:44:23] <jphase> brb, need an after-chicken smoke <3
[16:56:09] <hirsty> right now thats done...gotta head to bed :D
[16:56:23] <jphase> ciao hirsty
[16:57:08] <hirsty> tres bien et au revoir!
[16:57:31] <jphase> hehe, tres dificil!
[16:57:46] <jphase> +e
[16:57:56] <hirsty> ?#
[16:58:35] <hirsty> been a while since i did french :D
[16:59:32] <jphase> trés difficile = very difficult from what I remember
[16:59:38] <jphase> been awhile for me too

[17:35:59] <duch_kazatel> Chairman increase the 200 to 2000 if you want 2 seconds.
[17:36:40] <Mattx> Hey guys
[17:36:45] <Chairman> no no... the flash rate it supposed to be 200 ms, but the time between a full cycle is supposed to be 2000 ms
[17:36:50] <guideX> how does one make youtube videos full screen on my javascript command
[17:36:54] <guideX> or juqeyr
[17:36:59] <Mattx> how do you create css keyframes in JS/jQuery?
[17:37:12] <guideX> that requestFullScreen/webkitRequestFullScreen isn't working
[17:37:12] <duch_kazatel> Chairman really?  did you try to fix it yourself?
[17:37:28] <Chairman> yes, did you see my implementation #3
[17:37:32] <jphase> Mattx: why not just create them in css ?
[17:37:38] <Chairman> $(this).delay(2000), strobe;
[17:37:39] <duch_kazatel> Chairman did you see my versoon?
[17:37:53] <Chairman> I did, yours cycles through and continuously plays with no delay after each play
[17:38:04] <Mattx> jphase, 'cause the values changes dynamically
[17:38:04] <duch_kazatel> Chairman right.  so work against that to add what you want ;)
[17:38:26] <Mattx> jphase, for example, one keyframe is a transform: scale(...), the values are random
[17:38:27] <Chairman> I don't know how... which is why i am here.
[17:38:50] <duch_kazatel> i got you 80% of the way there ;)
[17:39:05] <Chairman> ok thanks.
[17:39:11] <jphase> Mattx: if you have to do that, you'd what to create a node and append it I'd think
[17:39:12] <ZeroBeholder> Thanks for helping me with the issues I had. This is what got built: http://codepen.io/bradchesney79/pen/ELqhz  or http://jsfiddle.net/DLFGV/
[17:39:35] <Mattx> jphase, you mean a <style> tag?
[17:39:39] <jphase> yes
[17:39:42] <Chairman> loop().delay(2000);
[17:39:44] <Chairman> doesn't work
[17:39:46] <Mattx> it would be full of trash
[17:39:51] <jphase> Mattx: it might be easiest to just use a server side language though, or just create several keyframes with various classes
[17:39:55] <Mattx> I guess I'll have to add a new name for every new keyframe?
[17:40:09] <ZeroBeholder> I prefer jsfiddle, but codepen gets through the firewall at work-- and I think codepen is slightly better. I am just used to jsfiddle.
[17:40:18] <jphase> Mattx: probably yes, or this would be a perfect situation to use LESS or SASS
[17:40:26] <Mattx> no
[17:40:32] <Mattx> it should be done in the client side
[17:40:55] <Mattx> I need potentially an infinite number of keyframes...
[17:41:10] <jphase> Mattx: you can modify the transition properties with jQuery though
[17:41:23] <Mattx> yeah, I thought about that
[17:41:35] <Mattx> but you can't pause a transition, which is another thing I need to do
[17:41:41] <ZeroBeholder> I used it earlier today to slog through some stuff I had to read, but it will never make any difference whether I read that dry a** crap that has nothing to do with what I do. Probably saved me 45 minutes.
[17:41:42] <jphase> so if you created one keyframe, you could attach them via a class to an element and then use .css to pwn the attributes
[17:41:44] <Mattx> you can only pause and resume animations
[17:41:57] <jphase> well toggling css is instant in most cases
[17:42:09] <jphase> relatively instant that is
[17:42:13] <Mattx> what do you mean by toggling?
[17:42:16] <duch_kazatel> Chairman btw, one way: http://jsfiddle.net/L39Xr/5/
[17:42:56] <jphase> Mattx: toggle might not be the right word, I just mean changing the css properties
[17:43:13] <Mattx> oh, ok
[17:43:22] <Mattx> the only problem I see in adding keyframes to a style tag
[17:43:38] <Mattx> is that I need to add infinite of them :P
[17:43:49] <Mattx> ..over time I mean
[17:44:11] <ZeroBeholder> Well, thanks again. Gotta put the kid to bed.
[17:44:25] <Chairman> thanks duch, that makes a lot more sense to me... I didn't know where to position the .delay
[17:44:38] <Mattx> I guess I can delete them too
[17:44:53] <Mattx> what a ugly workaround OMG
[17:46:03] <jphase> Mattx: and I assume you need to modify the actual keyframe instead of the keyframe properties yes?
[17:46:31] <Mattx> well, no, I can modify the keyframe properties
[17:46:48] <Mattx> in fact it's always a scale transformation
[17:47:24] <jphase> well the frame properties themselves I'm not sure how to modify with jquery, but the animation properties on the element would be as simple as using .css
[17:47:44] <Mattx> sure
[17:48:11] <BillCriswell> Hrm
[17:49:13] <Mattx> oh, actually. I can use var myStyle = $("<style>").appendTo("body"); myStyle.html("@keyframe ..."); myStyle.html("@keyframe ..."); ...
[17:49:15] <Mattx> that would work
[17:49:26] <Mattx> err, append to head I meant
[17:49:30] <jphase> yeah you can append, but...
[17:49:36] <jphase> you might want to look into something like:  Mattx: this is honestly a bit outside of my realm to
[17:49:41] <jphase> bah copy/paste fail
[17:49:45] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/russelluresti/RHhBz/2/
[17:49:56] <jphase> this guy is actually inserting/deleting rules
[17:50:21] <Mattx> whooa!
[17:50:33] <Mattx> I won't run over all rules and parse them myself
[17:50:36] <Mattx> it's crazy
[17:50:55] <Mattx> myStyle.html(...  is better I think :P
[17:51:04] <jphase> outside of that, your previous method may be the best bet yeah heh
[17:51:23] <guideX> youtubevideos aren't fullscreening :9
[17:51:29] <guideX> how do I do it?
[17:51:51] <jphase> Mattx: not to beat a dead horse, but this also looks interesting https://github.com/jQueryKeyframes/jQuery.Keyframes
[17:52:07] <jphase> again, a bit excessive
[17:53:41] <Mattx> oh, it's cool
[17:53:55] <Mattx> I'm checking how it does
[17:55:16] <Mattx>                 $frameStyle.html(css);
[17:55:21] <Mattx> it does exactly what I said
[17:55:31] <jphase> not surprised ;)
[17:55:40] <jphase> not many options when it comes to that stuff
[17:57:55] <Mattx> I'm going to use this lib and see
[17:57:56] <Mattx> thanks
[17:58:18] <jphase> I owe you thanks honestly, have never even considered what you're doing b4 ;)
[17:59:32] <Mattx> haha, crazy stuff
[18:00:57] <jphase> having a brain fart, if I've got a nav attached to my window scroll event am I not able to just trigger that event on load to make it show up when I access an anchor from a hash tag?
[18:02:04] <Mattx> whaaat?
[18:02:17] <Mattx> <example required>
[18:02:43] <jphase> well like... http://ct.thewirecloset.com/#work for example
[18:03:02] <jphase> as soon as you scroll the window jquery will know you're below the top slider and attach my nav
[18:03:14] <jphase> but I want to like... trigger that
[18:03:39] <Mattx> I guess you can
[18:04:08] <jphase> $(window).trigger('scroll'); as well as $('html, body').trigger('scroll'); on dom ready or load both no worky :\
[18:05:04] <jphase> meh, I guess I can just put the whole if check that I use to make that nav sticky in a function and call it or something
[18:05:34] <Mattx> the only thing that seems to change is position: fixed + top: 0
[18:05:54] <jphase> yeah, but that happens with jQuery based on the scroll position is the thing
[18:06:00] <Mattx> you can .css after .trigger(scroll)
[18:06:04] <Mattx> yeah, I know what you mean
[18:06:22] <jphase> like the scroll event seems to work money
[18:06:37] <jphase> but I'm somehow not able to trigger it... feeling nubbish right now
[18:07:05] <Mattx> it's not the page, is it?
[18:07:09] <Mattx> it doesn't have jquery
[18:07:24] <jphase> eh?
[18:07:24] <Mattx> I can't try myself :|
[18:07:51] <Mattx> $ is undefined for some reason
[18:07:59] <jphase> even when I use jQuery injector for chrome and type it into my console.
[18:08:21] <jphase> oh
[18:08:21] <jphase> jquery is loaded but I have to use jQuery injector on this page to use in console
[18:08:23] * jphase uses chrome
[18:08:40] <jphase> not sure why that is... bunch of sites do that and this is one of them
[18:08:55] <Mattx> weird
[18:09:15] <jphase> yeah, I honestly would love to know the reason for that
[18:09:32] <jphase> perhaps that's where I'm sticking the script? idfk.... I think folks with jquery in the head tag don't have that issue or sumpin
[18:09:58] <duch_kazatel> i’m off for the beginning of my birthday festivities.  enjoy folks.
[18:10:05] <Chairman> ty again
[18:10:17] <jphase> happy BDAY duch!!!
[18:10:48] <duch_kazatel> nah my bday isn’t until wedensday but i’m celebrating this weekend.  it’ll be awesome.
[18:10:49] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[18:10:53] <Mattx> jphase, can you show me the code of the callback?
[18:11:38] <jphase> Mattx: this is the entire jQuery stuffs on this page:   http://paste.ofcode.org/z2q48PqF73ZpDzkWizxt6Y
[18:11:45] <Mattx> 'cause .trigger("scroll") does trigger the event
[18:11:46] <jphase> (with an added trigger at the bottom)
[18:11:51] <Mattx> the problem I guess is in the callback
[18:11:54] <jphase> oic
[18:11:59] <Mattx> oh, ok
[18:12:04] <Mattx> then what is the problem? lol
[18:12:13] <jphase> I put it in the load event to?!?
[18:12:15] <jphase> too*
[18:12:25] <jphase> idfk, maybe it's cause that funny slider I'm using at the top
[18:12:39] <jphase> makes the screen jump which may F with things?
[18:13:14] <Mattx> wait a sec
[18:13:16] <jphase> oh snap...
[18:13:19] <jphase> chrome was caching my shit
[18:13:22] <jphase> DAMN IT!
[18:13:23] <Mattx> wtf?
[18:13:34] <Mattx> alright, solved I guess
[18:13:34] <jphase> let me push these changes to the site an be sure
[18:13:34] <Mattx> :P
[18:13:35] <jphase> lol
[18:13:41] <jphase> *facepalm*
[18:15:38] <jphase> okay, now it's happening 1/2 the time so must need to stick this in the window load event I have here
[18:15:46] <jphase> thanks for entertaining my nub lol
[18:15:54] <Mattx> o.o
[18:16:56] <Genesis_> can someone show me an example of how to add a 2 second delay to a for loop every recursive call?
[18:17:18] <Genesis_> (i.e. the first time its normal, after that there is a 3 second delay before it does the next element in the array)
[18:18:02] <jphase> Genesis_: use .delay() and a check to see if the loop index is > 0 ?
[18:18:16] <Genesis_> jphase: Could you show me an example?
[18:18:21] <Genesis_> I'm new to JS
[18:18:27] <jphase> oh okay, sec
[18:18:32] <Genesis_> thank you
[18:20:28] <Mattx> myArr = [1,2,3,4,5]; process = function() {e = myArr.shift(); if (e) { console.log(e); setTimeout(process, 2000)}}; process()
[18:20:43] <Mattx> it destroys the array btw, not sure if you want that but it's easy to fix
[18:21:39] <jphase> bah, Mattx beat me to it
[18:23:35] <Genesis_> Mattx: So I don't need a for loop?
[18:23:46] <Genesis_> will this loop again to the beginning of the array once it is done?
[18:24:02] <jphase> the array won't exist when it's done with that method Genesis_
[18:24:18] <Genesis_> is there a way to do this with TimeOut?
[18:24:26] <Mattx> Genesis_, not necessary
[18:24:40] * jphase points to the setTimeout in the example above ^
[18:24:40] <Mattx> with timeout? wtf?
[18:24:55] <Mattx> I guess you meant without timeout?
[18:25:12] <Genesis_> so you are just making a copy of the array
[18:25:19] <Genesis_> and as long as its not empty
[18:25:23] <Genesis_> going through it
[18:25:25] <Mattx> yep
[18:25:34] <Mattx> I'm not making a copy though
[18:25:37] <Genesis_> so whatever code I need to execute, I would replace console.log(e)
[18:25:38] <Genesis_> with it?
[18:25:41] <Mattx> just removing items from the beginning
[18:25:42] <Genesis_> you are shofting it by one.
[18:25:54] <Mattx> right
[18:25:59] <Genesis_> so if I wanted to say, insert an image
[18:26:05] <Genesis_> I would replace console.log(e);
[18:26:09] <Genesis_> with an append?
[18:26:12] <Mattx> right
[18:26:24] <Genesis_> what is process() doing, its calling it again?
[18:26:26] <Mattx> I would actually use a callback, but yes
[18:26:40] <Mattx> Genesis_, read the code, then ask
[18:26:52] <ia9371> if i am doing a contact form
[18:27:13] <ia9371> would jquery be a good way to use required items
[18:27:24] <Mattx> (it's calling itself after 2 seconds if there is an item)
[18:27:33] <Mattx> in fact I just found a bug, use this instead:
[18:27:45] <Genesis_> ah I see
[18:28:33] <Mattx> process = function(callback) {e = myArr.shift(); callback(e); if (myArr.length > 0) { setTimeout(process, 2000)}}
[18:28:34] <ia9371> im also using php
[18:28:35] <Mattx> myArr = [1,2,3,4,5]; callback = function(e) {console.log(e)}; process(callback)
[18:29:07] <Mattx> hmn, it would be even better if callback(e) is at the end of the function, not before setTimeout()
[18:29:09] <Mattx> but you got the idea
[18:29:22] <Genesis_> thank you
[18:29:38] <BillCriswell> ia9371: You use javascript only to double check validation. You always check server side as well.
[18:30:28] <ia9371> so I would use php and jquery?
[18:30:37] <jphase> yesm
[18:30:47] <Mattx> process = function(array, callback) { var elem = array.shift(); if (array.length > 0) { setTimeout(process(array, callback), 2000)} callback(elem) }
[18:30:48] <Mattx> that's it
[18:31:20] <BillCriswell> Yes, javascript to save a trip to the server.
[18:32:03] <BillCriswell> Javascript can be disabled to you can't rely on it.
[18:33:20] <BillCriswell> ( to validate user data ) haha
[19:03:27] <CarlFK> http://jsfiddle.net/AgC75/  .ajaxSend(function()  is working there, but not http://veyepar.nextdayvideo.com/main/E/8163/
[19:03:48] <CarlFK> but it does work here: http://veyepar.nextdayvideo.com/main/
[19:04:17] <CarlFK> ajaxSend doesn't get called if there is another form on the page
[19:20:48] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/ma8Bd/
[19:20:51] <Genesis_> am I missing something?
[19:21:45] <Genesis_> shouldn't it be inserting the numbers into the insert class?
[19:26:06] <Mattx> hey
[19:26:08] <Mattx> weird
[19:26:36] <Mattx> how is that   setTimeout($("whatever").remove, 1000) is different than setTimeout(function() {$("whatever").remove()}, 1000)
[19:26:49] <Mattx> (the first example doesn't work for some reason!)
[19:27:40] <Genesis_> Mattx: It is weird, not sure why it isn't working
[19:28:14] <Mattx> actually I use a variable instead of $("whatever"), I'm checking its values just in case
[19:28:18] <Mattx> value*
[19:28:44] <Genesis_> do you by chance know of a fix?
[19:29:09] <Mattx> of a fix for what?
[19:29:28] <Genesis_> for the numbers not being inserted
[19:30:01] <Mattx> what do you expect?
[19:31:53] <Genesis_> for the numbers in the array
[19:32:03] <Genesis_> to be inserted into the div class
[19:33:30] <Mattx> you have many errors
[19:33:50] <Mattx> starting from the awful/non-existing indentation in the code
[19:35:05] <Genesis_> http://jsfiddle.net/ma8Bd/2/
[19:35:07] <Genesis_> how is this
[19:35:28] <Mattx> still awful :P
[19:35:34] <Mattx> but better
[19:35:57] <Genesis_> so I am just trying to insert the numbers into the div class
[19:36:08] <Genesis_> when it gets called, e is the current element of the array, right?
[19:36:10] <Mattx> http://jsfiddle.net/ma8Bd/4/
[19:36:28] <Genesis_> oh awesome
[19:36:31] <Genesis_> lets take a look
[19:36:46] <Mattx> is this your use case?
[19:36:59] <Mattx> or just an example?
[19:37:18] <Genesis_> just an example
[19:37:21] <Mattx> ok
[19:37:25] <Genesis_> I plan to have it insert an image
[19:37:31] <Genesis_> then remove the image, and place another one
[19:37:37] <Genesis_> a "changing" banner basically.
[19:37:54] <Mattx> ok, then use .html not .append
[19:38:13] <Genesis_> gotcha
[19:38:14] <Genesis_> thank you
[19:42:14] <Mattx> weiiiird, I don't se why     setTimeout(foo.remove, 1000)    doesn't work
[19:43:13] <Mattx> is it some kind of bug? here is an example:    setTimeout($("body").remove, 1000)
[19:49:08] <jphase> Mattx: .remove() is what you're needing I believe
[19:49:24] <Mattx> no
[19:49:31] <Mattx> I'm passing the function so it's called after a second
[19:49:47] <Mattx> but for some reason it doesn't work, unless I wrap it into another function
[19:49:55] <Mattx> setTimeout($("body").remove, 1000)          <-- should work
[19:50:08] <Mattx> setTimeout(function() { $("body").remove() }, 1000)          <-- should work as well
[19:50:22] <Mattx> setTimeout($("body").remove(), 1000)          <-- should NOT work
[19:50:58] <Mattx> everything is ok with the last two, but the first one contradicts me! :P
[19:51:10] <jphase> well, var blah = function() { $('body').remove(); }; setTimeout(blah, 1000);  does work
[19:51:20] <Mattx> yeah
[19:51:21] <jphase> but if you were passing just $('body').remove you'd need the ()
[19:51:33] <Mattx> the point is, why  setTimeout($("body").remove, 1000)   doesn't
[19:52:48] <jphase> must be a jquery thing
[19:52:49] <Mattx> this does work as well: var r = function() {$("body").remove()}; setTimeout(r, 1000)
[19:52:50] <Mattx> lol
[19:52:55] <jphase> cause.... var blah = { poop: function() { $('body').remove(); }}; setTimeout(blah.poop, 1000);
[19:52:57] <Mattx> it looks like a bug
[19:53:00] <jphase> that works, so it's not a method issue
[19:53:20] <jphase> idk, you got me there heh
[19:53:37] <Mattx> I don't think it's even possible know, from inside .remove, that it's beeing called like that
[19:53:40] <jphase> probably the way jQuery is returning the object for chaining, idk
[19:53:47] <Mattx> so there's no way it could change its behaviour
[19:53:58] <Mattx> possible to know *
[19:57:37] <Mattx> same with .hide
[19:57:46] <Mattx> .show, etc
[19:57:52] <Mattx> well, anyway
[19:58:33] <jphase> well if what you're passing can't be called it can't be executed either, console.log($('body').remove); returns the function prototype itself as a string without executing it
[19:58:44] <jphase> idk
[19:58:49] <jphase> this stuff is > jphase
[19:59:19] <Mattx> argh, I can't wrap it into a function
[19:59:28] <Mattx> it's not the same
[19:59:40] <jphase> what are you trying to do?
[20:00:05] <Mattx> foo = $("#foo"); setTimeout(function() { foo.remove() }, 10000)
[20:00:23] <Mattx> if within these 10s you change foo, the first element you intended to remove won't be removed
[20:00:42] <Mattx> that's why I needed to call it like in setTimeout(foo.remove, 10000)
[20:00:57] <jphase> oic
[20:07:54] <Mattx> this would work, but is incredible ugly:
[20:07:55] <Mattx> var foo = function(e) {
[20:07:55] <Mattx>   setTimeout(function() {
[20:07:55] <Mattx>     e.remove()
[20:07:55] <Mattx>   }, 1000)
[20:07:55] <Mattx> }
[20:07:57] <Mattx> foo($("body"))
[20:17:40] <x-finite> I am using the date function in jquery, while it is calculating the age perfectly.. i noticed that entering values such as 5/5/5 (dd/mm/yyyy) throws an age of 108 .. while enter 1/1/1 throws 113
[20:18:16] <x-finite> this is how its being used to calculate the age var myage = Math.floor((datetoday - birthday) / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
[20:19:01] <Jattenalle> x-finite, yes?
[20:21:20] <x-finite> Jattenalle, so is this normal behavior .. such that i put in conditions to stop users from entering such values
[20:21:39] <Jattenalle> im not sure what you're trying to do, the values look correct though
[20:22:05] <x-finite> if i was born in the year 0001
[20:22:08] <Jattenalle> just check for age > 80 or somesuch if you really care
[20:22:19] <x-finite> what should be my age?
[20:22:26] <Jattenalle> 1/1/1 is not 1/1/1, it starts at 1900
[20:22:34] <Jattenalle> so 1/1/1 = 1/1/1901
[20:22:58] <x-finite> alright
[20:23:13] <x-finite> now i know what to do now : )
[20:23:14] <Jattenalle> when you enter it shorthand like that, it assumes 1900+
[20:24:45] <x-finite> Jattenalle, theoritically speaking .. what if someone greater than the age of 114 visits?
[20:24:56] <Jattenalle> then date functions break
[20:25:38] <x-finite> no work arounds?
[20:26:00] <Jattenalle> sure, plenty of ways to work around it
[20:26:04] <Jattenalle> but why bother?
[20:26:33] <x-finite> would appreciate if you direct me to one
[20:27:36] <Jattenalle> x-finite, i dont know what you're trying to do, i can't direct you to anything without knowing what you want to do
[20:28:39] <x-finite> Jattenalle, its an age verification system .. anyway i just tested and it appears to be working fine when i enter years such as 1800 etc ... so no problems there
[20:28:54] <Jattenalle> yeah, that's what i said, it only makes it 1900 if you enter it shorthand
[20:29:14] <Jattenalle> and again, if it's for an age verification system, you shouldnt allow any age over, say, 80 or 90
[20:29:16] <x-finite> Jattenalle, however .. i still can't figure out how the short hand works for example if i enter 1/1/55 it throws me an age of 59
[20:29:31] <Jattenalle> 1/1/55 = 1/1/1955
[20:29:38] <x-finite> ahan
[20:29:44] <Jattenalle> if year < 4 digits = shorthand
[20:30:07] <x-finite> 1/1/100 = 1/1/1100
[20:30:24] <Jattenalle> err, yeah, sorry
[20:30:29] <Jattenalle> < 3 digits*
[20:30:45] <x-finite> 1/1/100 throws me 1914 whereas 1/1/1100 throws me 914
[20:30:58] <Jattenalle> just check if the year part of the time is < 4 digits
[20:31:09] <Jattenalle> and if it is... tell people to enter a 4 digit year
[20:31:27] <x-finite> still, just wanted to know for GK
[20:31:38] <x-finite> i better look up google :)
[20:34:30] <x-finite> thanks .. it helped a lot
[21:23:23] <Mattx> jphase, in case you're curious about the problem with the timeout .remove, the problem is that .remove needs the element in the scope in order to work
[21:23:40] <jphase> ahhh, that makes sense
[21:23:42] <Mattx> for example, this works:  setTimeout(foo.remove.bind(foo), 1000)
[22:57:06] <aro> i am using a context menu on an unordered list - how can i prevent a right click on a child element from referencing parent?
[23:01:00] <jphase> aro:  $('#parent .child').on('contextmenu', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[23:14:48] <teza19> Hi, I have a 'fixed' header (height: 30px) and I'm using jQuery to 'scroll to' an ID. This works fine, but because the header is fixed, it covers the heading after the 'scroll to' is executed. Is there a way to 'scroll to' - 30px ?
[23:17:30] <teza19> Got it :) .offset().top-<pix>
