[05:38:24] <pavonia> jquery-novice: Looks like your valid() result doesn't depend on the validate function result at all

[08:31:22] <printForever> I've ran into a problem with ReactJS but the problem is based in basic JavaScript. So I'm using Axios for fetch/Promise. When I've executed the axios get function I'm returned a full object instead of object.data. https://pastebin.com/Z7UMfpUy

[16:41:37] <weblion> hi
[16:41:49] <weblion> $(location).attr('href') for current page location
[16:42:01] <weblion> is it also possible to get just the anchor part - with jquery?
[16:42:04] <weblion> :)
[16:42:40] <snover> weblion: that is a silly/wrong use of jquery. just type `location.href`.
[16:42:51] <weblion> ah, thanks :P
[16:42:57] <weblion> and just the anchor? not the whole URL?
[16:43:01] <snover> location.hash
