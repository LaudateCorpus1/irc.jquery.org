[00:05:34] <zagaza> Cork: you still on?
[00:05:51] <Cork> zagaza: just ask the question if you have one
[00:06:41] <zagaza> sure, I uploaded the changes to another domain instead with the unminified script: http://bansolo.se/offert/
[00:06:56] <zagaza> exactly the same error still so it's all good
[00:12:33] <zagaza> or it's all bad even :)
[00:43:04] <zagaza> can someone please help me out? what am I doing wrong? I am trying to load iFrameResizer.js and initializing it but I am getting TypeError: Options is not an object. http://bansolo.se/offert/
[01:17:45] <jemendja> hi
[01:40:57] <Rickardo1> how do I move an element rather than copy it's html to a new position in dom?
[01:51:36] <Cork> Rickardo1: if you don't convert the element to html it will be moved by default
[01:57:14] <Rickardo1> Cork: Got it.. ty
[02:08:53] <FransNL_> what test framework should i use ?
[02:09:15] <FransNL_> QUnit?
[03:05:32] <kaseOga> hi \o
[03:05:40] <kaseOga> someone can help me? xD
[03:08:33] <richars> hello, how can i align the images vertically here, means all images in the row taking same space?  http://jsfiddle.net/Xjre6/1/
[03:20:23] <Cork> richars: you could try using css flex
[03:20:42] <Cork> though it is very new so quite few older browsers support it
[03:21:47] <Cork> richars: another alternative is to wrap the img tag with a div and set a fixed height on them
[03:22:17] <Cork> you don't really have rows as you float the lis so that one is going to be a bit tough
[03:31:30] <gurke_> what was the selector to get the same as .innerHTML does?
[03:31:50] <Cork> gurke_: there isn't one
[03:31:56] <gurke_> not? :<
[03:32:06] <Cork> there is a sizzle command to you can run in the selector
[03:32:11] <Cork> but it isn't really recommended
[03:32:14] <Cork> .contains()
[03:32:16] <gurke_> i want to select $('#bla') and get the content
[03:32:19] <Cork> ?:contains
[03:32:32] <Cork> gurke_: then $('#bla').html()
[03:32:36] <gurke_> ah thanks
[03:32:38] <gurke_> :)
[03:32:49] <Cork> gurke_: that isn't in the selector though
[03:33:04] <gurke_> you are right
[03:33:23] <gurke_> asked the wrong question
[03:34:05] <gurke_> what is it called cork?
[03:34:14] <Cork> member function
[03:34:30] <gurke_> thanks
[03:34:32] <Cork> gurke_: note you normally don't use .html() unless you want to debug things
[03:34:40] <Cork> as that serializes the dom
[03:34:46] <Cork> you normally work with the dom elements
[03:35:08] <gurke_> hmm okay
[03:35:39] <gurke_> well i just want to upgrade an source of an image by getting the url out of an textarea
[03:36:44] <gurke_> do you have an better way to do that cork? :)
[03:37:27] <DRSK> Cork » I'm checking an image offset using offset().top, then I'm comparing that value to window scrollTop(). I'm trying to create a value that's based on the image height, considering a ratio value and then starting from something that *could* be -160 and when scrolltop matches offset it's 0, and then up to +160. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how such a calculation might work, got any ideas or hints? =)
[03:37:31] <Cork> gurke_: $('#img').prop('src', $('#textarea').val())
[03:38:17] <gurke_> wut.. thats it? :) thanks
[03:38:37] <Cork> gurke_: if the textarea contains the full url ya
[03:38:44] <gurke_> yea
[03:38:48] <gurke_> thats great
[03:38:52] <gurke_> hugs
[03:39:52] <Cork> DRSK: could you explain what you want to do instead?
[03:40:49] <DRSK> Cork » I'm trying to create a 'curve' or what have you to alter the Y value of a translate3d based on scroll and image position really, parallaxed really
[03:47:03] <dubphil> Hello ! is there someone here who can guess why the "save_comment" button (line 243) click is not detected as event (line 184) ? here is the code : http://pastebin.com/LU8LD5VS
[03:48:06] <gurke_> Cork, how do i append that into an eventhandler when changes were made in any element of #editor
[03:49:36] <dubphil> the same code for the "show_comments" button (line 58) have his click event detected (line 157)
[03:51:00] <gurke_> dubphil, true dat... but i want to append the changes when editing
[03:51:52] <dubphil> gurke_: is it because the "save_comment" button is itself already loaded by ajax (and then doesn't know the existence of the jquery function ?
[03:51:55] <gurke_> so when i write down something it immediately updates the content
[03:52:41] <gurke_> dubphil, hu? you asking the wrong person :P
[03:52:48] <gurke_> iam very newb to jquery
[03:53:31] <dubphil> gurke_: sorry you mention my name I thougth you were answer to my question
[03:53:52] <dubphil> but I didn't understand a clue of what you ment :)
[03:54:03] <gurke_> i was wondering if you answering my question haha
[03:56:09] <dubphil> gurke_: catch a change() and do what it needs
[03:57:26] <gurke_> thank you dubphil
[03:57:27] <dubphil> $("#editor").change( function(event) { //your code });
[03:58:24] <gurke_> does that respect any changes in #editor? even the childs?
[03:58:26] <Cork> gurke_: #editor is one element
[03:58:28] <Cork> not any element
[03:58:38] <Cork> ids can only exist on one element
[03:58:45] <Cork> if you want multiple you use a class
[03:59:04] <Cork> gurke_: also you most likely want to input event not change
[03:59:14] <Cork> as change only fires on blur of the element
[03:59:33] <gurke_> i dont understand
[03:59:42] <gurke_> :(
[03:59:48] <gurke_> i need a meal.. brb
[03:59:48] <Cork> $('#editor').on('input', function() { $('#img').prop('src', $(this).val()); });
[04:27:14] <silverdust> Good morning y'all
[04:27:40] <erming> hi
[04:27:51] <silverdust> I need the listed navs to switch to respective pages http://jsbin.com/volekene/1/
[04:28:01] <silverdust> That's the best I could come up with
[04:28:46] <silverdust> when I click staff info, it goes the staff info view but then doesn't go back to company info
[04:29:51] <silverdust> How can I make this work like a normal tabbing
[04:30:27] <Cork> silverdust: firstly http://jsbin.com/volekene/2/edit
[04:30:43] <Cork> silverdust: also you only have one template
[04:30:59] <Cork> you need to have one template for each state
[04:34:05] <silverdust> Cork: I have two templates there I think
[04:34:22] <silverdust> I have for the company info which is default
[04:34:38] <silverdust> and then the staff info
[04:35:59] <silverdust> and the .clone() isn't giving me any result like append was
[04:41:18] <gurke_> hey Cork.. sorry but can you take a look please? http://pastebin.com/7FdNkBZj
[04:41:31] <gurke_> on line 40 i have the javascript
[04:43:25] <gurke_> it doesnt change the source of the image
[04:44:46] <Cork> silverdust: http://jsbin.com/volekene/2/edit
[04:47:54] <Cork> gurke_: you need to wait for dom ready
[04:48:09] <Cork> gurke_: the event handler isn't added cause $('#edit_image') doesn't return anything
[04:48:38] <Cork> gurke_: move the script to the end of the body or use $(function() {}); around the code
[04:48:49] <gurke_> ah okay thanks
[04:49:40] <gurke_> nice that works.. can i also load that one time when loading the page not just editing?
[04:52:06] <silverdust> Thanks Cork
[04:52:56] <Cork> gurke_: sure
[04:53:06] <Cork> you can either fire a fake event on the textarea
[04:53:15] <gurke_> that sounds nice
[04:53:35] <Cork> or just run the $('#live_image').prop('src', $('#edit_image').val())
[04:55:50] <gurke_> thats awesome cork :)
[04:56:13] <gurke_> $('#edit_heading').on('input', function() { $('#live_heading').val($(this).val()); });
[04:56:18] <gurke_> this does not work
[04:56:27] <gurke_> i think .val is wrong for that? its just plain text
[04:56:45] <silverdust> Cork: you tweaked the HTML?
[04:57:25] <gurke_> $('#edit_heading').on('input', function() { $('#live_heading').html($(this).val()); });
[04:57:27] <gurke_> that works :)
[04:58:08] <silverdust> I just dumped the JS you used from jsbin to replace my JS
[04:58:51] <silverdust> and it doesn't respond as expected on my page
[04:59:06] <silverdust> I love the way it works on jsbin though
[04:59:39] <Cork> silverdust: i fixed up a lot of things
[04:59:48] <Cork> html, css and js
[05:01:14] <Cork> silverdust: i created the missing template and removed the broken links at the top
[05:01:22] <Cork> silverdust: i also removed the duplicate ids
[05:02:48] <silverdust> ok thanks
[05:03:07] <silverdust> I copied the html too and it's fine now
[05:04:00] <silverdust> I needed the links though
[05:04:11] <Cork> silverdust: why do you need broken links?
[05:04:27] <silverdust> Since they went no where, I didn't think it mattered
[05:04:35] <Cork> they where broken
[05:04:36] <silverdust> with the preventDefault()
[05:04:51] <Cork> just style the li element to look the way you want
[05:05:04] <Cork> no need to add broken <a> tags for the styling
[05:05:35] <silverdust> ok. I was also taken advantage of the <a>'s cursor: pointer
[05:05:58] <silverdust> I'll just set all that to the <li> now
[05:33:22] <Garmageddon> Can anyone help me figure out how to get jquery working in drupal 7? I can't access anthing with a $ to save my life and I can see jquery 1.10 is being loaded in the chrome developer panel
[05:34:10] <doberman> Can you access it with "jQuery" instead of $ ?
[05:34:59] <doberman> Garmageddon, check out https://drupal.org/project/jquery_dollar
[05:35:02] <Garmageddon> so far I've written this (function($) {
[05:35:02] <Garmageddon> 	Drupal.behaviors.myBehavior = {
[05:35:02] <Garmageddon> 	  attach: function (context) {
[05:35:02] <Garmageddon> 	    //code start
[05:35:02] <Garmageddon> 	      alert("Hello World");
[05:35:03] <Garmageddon> 	    //code ends
[05:35:05] <Garmageddon> 	  }
[05:35:07] <Garmageddon> 	};
[05:35:09] <Garmageddon> })(jQuery);
[05:35:10] <doberman> Oh pleaes. Don't paste here.
[05:35:13] <Garmageddon> oh sorry
[05:35:29] <Garmageddon> yea that could get pretty spammy
[05:35:37] <Garmageddon> I thought it was going to do one line
[05:35:51] <doberman> See what I wrote or use jQuery instead of dollar sign.
[05:39:13] <Tad3j> is there a way to trigger html5 validation without submitting the form?
[05:39:29] <Cork> Tad3j: no
[05:39:44] <Tad3j> Cork, thanks :/
[05:39:56] <Cork> Tad3j: np, and ya i find it a bit silly too
[05:40:51] <gurke_> Cork, why you so kind?
[05:41:07] <Cork> gurke_: sorry??
[05:41:11] <Tad3j> any suggestion how to perform some action before form gets submited and triggering validation before that?
[05:41:39] <gurke_> Cork, its like you enjoy helping people :D
[05:41:59] <sacho> use onsubmit and prevent the default behavior.
[05:42:05] <Cork> gurke_: i do it cause it keeps me exposed to different kind of problems
[05:42:18] <sacho> oh, html5 validation.
[05:42:22] <sacho> not sure, then.
[05:42:24] <Cork> ya
[05:42:30] <gurke_> nice
[05:42:36] <Cork> Tad3j: i haven't found a solution for it
[05:42:44] <seutje> Garmageddon: check https://drupal.org/node/756722#using-jquery
[05:42:47] <gurke_> when i know the answer i answer also questions... mostly in #css :P
[05:42:47] <Cork> though admittedly i haven't looked very hard
[05:43:06] <Tad3j> Cork, I see
[05:43:15] <Cork> gurke_: just hanging around and looking at others questions and the given answers is a good way to learn
[05:43:30] <Cork> (and is why i'm quite hard on having as much as possible happen in the channel)
[05:43:31] <gurke_> thats true :)
[05:44:00] <seutje> doberman: I hope that module dies in a fire :x
[05:44:04] <Tad3j> Crok, I was able to trigger it via .submit method and using preventDefault there
[05:44:20] <dubphil> Cork: are you coding in php also ?
[05:44:21] <Cork> Tad3j: interesting
[05:44:24] <Tad3j> however, have some problems triggering submit after ajax call is successfully made before form submit
[05:44:32] <Cork> Tad3j: thx :)
[05:45:07] <Cork> Tad3j: you could be able to trigger the submit event multiple times
[05:45:16] <Tad3j> Cork, np, glad you also have something from it :)
[05:45:20] <Cork> though your event handler would have to be careful to not cause a loop :)
[05:45:53] <seutje> love those
[05:45:53] <Tad3j> the problem is that if I submit form the .submit method event will be called, so I have problems with recursion
[05:45:56] <Cork> dubphil: i code quite little in php now days, but yes i do code in it and has coded a lot (and i have handled drupal <= 6)
[05:45:57] <Tad3j> yep, exactlly
[05:46:06] <Tad3j> Cork, any suggestion how to overcome that?
[05:46:21] <Cork> Tad3j: you could set a data('refire', true) value
[05:46:32] <Cork> and if it is set don't trigger again
[05:46:46] <Cork> hmm
[05:46:48] <Cork> actually
[05:47:00] <Cork> Tad3j: try running formelement.submit()
[05:47:10] <Cork> meaning NOT $(formelement).submit()
[05:47:10] <doberman> seutje, I share the same feeling, but for drupal :)
[05:47:54] <Cork> dobalina: ya, there is a reason why i don't use it anymore :)
[05:50:10] <seutje> at least it doesn't undo a standard it tries to impose
[05:50:26] <Cork> seutje: standard?
[05:51:57] <doberman> seutje, what standard?
[05:54:31] <seutje> of using a closure and not hosing the global $
[05:54:41] <Cork> ah
[05:54:51] <Cork> wasn't sure what you talked about before :)
[05:56:17] <Tad3j> Cork, I tried that but am still getting stuck in the loop
[05:56:30] <zafu> hi, anyone worked on implementing facebook login on a website?
[05:56:47] <Cork> Tad3j: i think your still calling the jquery function and not the dom function
[05:57:33] <Tad3j> var form = $('#myform');
[05:57:33] <Tad3j> form.submit();
[05:57:39] <Tad3j> this is what I use there
[05:57:46] <Tad3j> I guess it's wrong
[05:58:14] <Cork> $('#myform')[0].submit()
[05:58:17] <dubphil> Cork: ok just to know if you were using jquery inside a php framework like Yii for example
[05:58:53] <Cork> heh i've used it inside drupal, and wordpress
[05:59:05] <Cork> i've learned to stay away from cms system since then :)
[05:59:15] <Cork> and the php i write is without frameworks/cms systems
[06:02:13] <lord4163> Why does this give me the wrong date? http://paste.kde.org/pcm3i7a0f
[06:02:26] <Garmageddon> I thought I was comfortable with jquery until I tried to use it in drupal....
[06:02:39] <doberman> Change drupal, not jQuery.
[06:02:44] <doberman> :)
[06:06:04] <Tad3j> Cork, any idea why that wouldn't submit the form?
[06:06:23] <Cork> Tad3j: ah right ajax...
[06:06:24] <Tad3j> $('#myform')[0].submit();
[06:06:37] <Cork> ya that would submit the form if html validation didn't fail
[06:07:28] <Tad3j> code is reached but form is not submitted although it should be :/
[06:07:39] <delboy1978uk1> can anyone tell why my bootstrap modal is screwed on my iphone? works great on my computer http://independencelive.net
[06:07:47] <delboy1978uk1> its the more info buttons
[06:07:48] <Tad3j> I mean, form is valid and ajax call is made successfully
[06:09:55] <doberman> delboy1978uk1, it's CSS issue
[06:11:16] <Cork> lord4163: http://jsfiddle.net/kh5YS/
[06:12:02] <lord4163> Cork: hm had to use getDate() instead of getDay :)
[06:12:08] <Cork> ah right
[06:12:19] <Cork> lord4163: missed that part
[06:12:31] <Cork> lord4163: but anyway you can do away with the if cases if you want
[06:12:35] <lord4163> Cork: and mm+1 because it starts counting at 0
[06:12:57] <doberman> or with 2 more clean if cases instead of 3 :)
[06:13:06] <lord4163> Cork: okay :)
[06:13:08] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/kh5YS/1/
[06:13:54] <lord4163> Cork: Cool will use that instead :-)
[06:14:55] <MikeD_> why is padding 5 characters?
[06:15:36] <Cork> MikeD_: just a random number :)
[06:15:50] <delboy1978uk1> thanks doberman i'll see what i can do
[06:15:59] <Cork> any number is ok as long as it is at least as long as the longest padding you'll ever need
[06:16:27] <MikeD_> kk, just curious - i'd never think to use that approach
[06:17:21] <Cork> MikeD_: it's a quite common pattern to do number padding in js
[06:18:04] <MikeD_> is there a less verbose way?
[06:18:21] <Cork> no
[06:21:11] <BillCriswell> Why not ('000000' + 7).slice(-2)?
[06:21:26] <MikeD_> yeah, that's what I was thinking
[06:21:47] <Cork> hmm should work
[06:22:59] <MikeD_> that's more like the right( 'padding'+shortN, length) from ... languages that support a "right" string function
[06:24:05] <BillCriswell> I should look at more languages. I bet there's a perfect language out there for me somewhere.
[06:24:16] <Cork> heh
[06:24:19] <MikeD_> there isn't
[06:24:26] <Cork> BillCriswell: most likely not
[06:24:36] <Cork> there is no perfect fit all language
[06:24:39] <BillCriswell> Cork: I'm just being a romantic.
[06:24:56] <MikeD_> i extrapolate from Sorella's experience... 'doesn't seem truly happy with any of them :)
[06:24:56] <Cork> sadly there is plenty who think there is
[06:25:15] <Cork> and write converters/emulators so they can write "there" language where ever they are
[06:25:20] <decx> i'm writing all my apps in marklar
[06:25:25] <Cork> and it normally result in horrible performance
[06:25:25] <decx> this is the syntax: marklar
[06:25:25] <dan2k3k4> I'm wanting to set-up a colorbox gallery for a list like: <div id='ITEM1' class='item'><div class='img' style='background-img: url("img-url1")'></div></div> <div id='ITEM2' class='item'><div class='img' style='background-img: url("img-url2")'></div></div>
[06:25:36] <dan2k3k4> but I need to pop-up a different image URL (larger image format
[06:25:53] <dan2k3k4> so I guess I need to use data-href='img-url1_large' ?
[06:26:02] <BillCriswell> I like the way ruby reads, but oddly enough I don't enjoy writing in it (in my very short go at it).
[06:26:49] <BillCriswell> dan2k3k4: Yeah, or make it a link and just use href.
[06:27:11] <BillCriswell> That way all 20 users without JS would still be able to view it.
[06:27:22] <BillCriswell> decx is one of them.
[06:27:39] <ChrisAntaki> hey all :)
[06:27:57] <MikeD_> and spiders
[06:28:04] <hlvwrk> sup dudes. so here's my thing. http://jsfiddle.net/75gRR/ i need to make it so when a user types 'domain/user' in the text box, and clicks the convert button, it outputs 'user
[06:28:06] <ChrisAntaki> scott_gonzalez: how's it going?
[06:28:08] <hlvwrk> user@domain
[06:28:09] <hlvwrk> lsdfkns
[06:28:12] <Cork> BillCriswell: ya ruby is a bit weird at first
[06:28:25] <Cork> BillCriswell: but you learn to live with it after a while
[06:28:26] <Cork> :)
[06:28:26] <dan2k3k4> BillCriswell, well the whole site is without links and uses JS for navigation (I need to change this at some point but I prefer not seeing hover-links)
[06:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> ChrisAntaki: Good. you?
[06:28:35] <Cork> BillCriswell: you might really like go though
[06:28:51] <ChrisAntaki> good, just re-watching Prison Break and coding
[06:28:51] <BillCriswell> hlvwrk: input.split('/').join('@')
[06:29:05] <BillCriswell> Cork: I need to find a good reason to use it. That's ALWAYS my issue haha
[06:29:11] <Cork> lol
[06:29:23] <MikeD_> bill, that forgets the the reversal of items 1 and 2
[06:29:30] <ChrisAntaki> scott_gonzalez: would you want to collab on the Sizzle IE9+ branch?
[06:29:37] <Cork> BillCriswell: we're getting closer and closer to hmm need to install a webserver to run an app for... na, we just use go and templates :)
[06:29:45] <hlvwrk> BillCriswell: explain?
[06:29:47] <hlvwrk> :P
[06:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> ChrisAntaki: Nope. I don't work on Sizzle at all.
[06:30:40] <Cork> js> var input = "user/domain"; print(input.split('/').join('@'));
[06:30:45] <b-ot> '));: user@domain
[06:30:51] <Cork> <_<'

[06:31:16] <Cork> lol i saw the @ XD
[06:31:16] <BillCriswell> hlvwrk: .split('/') breaks a string into peices on /, .join('@') puts the array together with @ in the middle.
[06:31:40] <ChrisAntaki> scott_gonzalez: k, i'll hit up the team, thanks!
[06:31:54] <BillCriswell> breaks the string into an array*
[06:31:58] <Cork> you could just do .replace('/', '@') too though
[06:32:02] <gregf_> is it possible please? as the server has no idea on what styles were used on the client side :/
[06:32:11] <Cork> js> var input = "user/domain"; print(input.replace('/','@'));
[06:32:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: Duh, very true.
[06:32:16] <b-ot> '));: user@domain
[06:32:24] <hlvwrk> hm ;o
[06:32:42] <dan2k3k4> js> window.alert('t');
[06:32:47] <b-ot> dan2k3k4: No output.
[06:32:50] <decx> is that a cthulhu smiley? '));:
[06:32:51] <BillCriswell> I split and join too much.
[06:33:04] <BillCriswell> decx: It looks like a sad spider to me.
[06:33:09] <Cork> js> print("hello") @ decx
[06:33:13] <b-ot> decx: No output.
[06:33:16] <K4T> which plugin do you recommend gor google maps?
[06:33:21] <K4T> for*
[06:33:24] <hlvwrk> im doing this wrong i think
[06:33:27] <dan2k3k4> js> print('t');
[06:33:29] <decx> b-ot just described my week
[06:33:30] <Cork> decx: the bot just saw the @
[06:33:33] <b-ot> dan2k3k4: t
[06:33:38] <ChrisAntaki> K4T: their JS API is pretty good
[06:34:00] <K4T> so no plugins...
[06:34:02] <dan2k3k4> js> print('t'); \@ dan2k3k4
[06:34:07] <b-ot> dan2k3k4: No output.
[06:34:07] <dan2k3k4> :o
[06:35:10] <BillCriswell> js> return '123'
[06:35:17] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[06:35:19] <ChrisAntaki> Google Maps is its own ecosystem K4T, at least in my experience
[06:35:21] <BillCriswell> Ok. =(
[06:36:27] <BillCriswell> js> function foo () { return '123'; } return foo();
[06:36:32] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[06:36:32] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[06:36:36] <BillCriswell> js> function foo () { return '123'; } foo();
[06:36:39] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[06:36:55] <Cork> js> function foo () { return '123'; }; print(foo())
[06:36:56] <BillCriswell> js> 'Last time, sorry everyone'
[06:37:00] <b-ot> Cork: 123
[06:37:05] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[06:37:07] <BillCriswell> Ohhh, print.
[06:37:20] <Cork> js> function foo () { return '123'; }; print(foo.toSource())
[06:37:24] <b-ot> Cork: function foo() {return "123";}
[06:37:50] <BillCriswell> I was thinking of it as just a console.
[06:39:16] <drej> good morning children
[06:39:18] <hlvwrk> soooo
[06:39:36] <hlvwrk> i think im doing thiswrong
[06:39:36] <hlvwrk> :(
[06:39:52] <drej> i havent seen it yet, but i agree with you hlvwrk
[06:40:52] <Cork> lol
[06:42:49] <dob> Hi, I'm trying to grab json from an api and display it in tabular format. Wondering where im going wrong with my code. Anyone that wants to help - it's very much appreciated http://pastebin.com/jDGcyRe6
[06:42:55] <MikeD_> why does b-ot keep saying 'no output' ?
[06:43:21] <BillCriswell> MikeD_: Mostly because I can't communicate with it properly.
[06:43:44] <MikeD_> oh, is there another jsbot in this channel?
[06:44:13] <BillCriswell> dob: You need to put the table generation in the callback of $.ajax
[06:44:29] <BillCriswell> Wait you are.
[06:45:20] <BillCriswell> Code it tough to read.
[06:46:18] <dob> BillCriswell: Hmm, what do you mean? Like poorly indented? sorry
[06:46:19] <MikeD_> the display on my car today said "cap check fuel" and i was like "wtf?" until I realized I'd read those words out of order *smh*
[06:47:05] <BillCriswell> dob: type: 'json' isn't right, should be get or post I think.
[06:47:13] <BillCriswell> Wait no.
[06:47:20] <BillCriswell> What the hell is wrong with my brain today
[06:47:41] <BillCriswell> dob: console.log(obj) and make sure it's what you think it is.
[06:47:49] <dob> okie
[06:48:02] <BillCriswell> Also, make sure you initialize x
[06:48:05] <BillCriswell> c*
[06:48:27] <ChrisAntaki> dataType: 'json', perhaps
[06:49:30] <BillCriswell> Could just use $.getJSON('url').done(function() {});
[06:49:58] <ChrisAntaki> that is pretty descriptive
[06:52:35] <BillCriswell> dob: http://jsbin.com/povatupe/1/edit?js,output
[06:52:57] <BillCriswell> Your code is good, just somehthing else doing something weird.
[06:53:51] <dob> BillCriswell: Thanks a lot :)
[06:56:37] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:11:28] <Guest4796> using jquery-ui 1.10.4, the datepicker control seems to have problems with chrome - it acts as if the date is entered in mm/dd/yy format when it's actually in dd/mm/yy format. so if you set any date with a day over 12 it fails validation. it works fine in other browsers. any advice on how to fix this?
[07:18:04] <m4strmindwork> Guest4796, i'm not sure but i'm wondering if your browsers regional settings will determine what input the date control uses
[07:20:04] <m4strmindwork> Guest4796, this also might be useful to you http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#date-formats
[07:21:53] <MikeD_> is .autosize() an extension ?
[07:21:59] <Cork> ya
[07:22:05] <Cork> *plugin
[07:22:30] <hackal> hello, can I also select elemets like this? $('.myclass div button') ?
[07:22:49] <Cork> hackal: depends on what element you want to select, but... "yes"
[07:23:10] <Cork> hackal: jquery uses normal css selectors
[07:23:21] <Cork> with some optional extensions
[07:23:30] <hackal> my case is button inside div. this is what I have in my style css to select that button ".panel-body button"
[07:23:49] <Hyperking> can someone help? using this plugin http://beezee.github.io/djax.html how would I bind a click event if my element is not generated in the dom using leafletjs marker popup http://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons.html
[07:24:12] <hackal> Cork: so I can use same selector as css and I dont need to asign an ID to button right?
[07:24:21] <Cork> hackal: yes
[07:24:40] <hackal> Cork: Thanks
[07:24:57] <Cork> hackal: you might like this answer: behind the seen jquery is using document.querySelectorAll
[07:25:02] <Cork> ?mdn querySelectorAll
[07:25:03] <b-ot> Cork: document.querySelectorAll - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer ... → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document.querySelectorAll
[07:25:16] <decx> it's actually behind the scene :>
[07:25:29] <Cork> opps XD
[07:26:03] <decx> for all intensive tortoises it still works with seen
[07:26:38] <hlvwrk> o_O
[07:44:14] <DelphiWorld> hey jQueryers
[07:44:19] <DelphiWorld> question for jQm
[07:44:30] <DelphiWorld> when adding scripts in <head></head>
[07:44:38] <DelphiWorld> its taking long time to load a page
[07:44:47] <drej> jQueristas
[07:44:47] <DelphiWorld> and this is a multipage but single html file
[07:44:57] <DelphiWorld> where can i put it else?
[07:45:10] <drej> at the bottom
[07:45:14] <drej> before </body>
[07:45:20] <drej> like all js has been included for the last 10 years
[07:45:34] <DelphiWorld> drej: oh, people include it in <head>...
[07:45:43] <drej> they shouldnt
[07:46:01] <drej> anyway, if you push it to the bottom of the page, its not render blocking
[07:46:01] <DelphiWorld> :)
[07:46:04] <DelphiWorld> thank drej
[07:46:27] <DelphiWorld> drej:  will change it now
[07:48:12] <DelphiWorld> drej: would you mind viewing my page and see if its work for you?
[07:50:17] <Hyperking> would this work? $(domRealelement).appendTo(jqueryMagicelement);
[07:50:33] <Hyperking> or why wouldn't this work?
[07:52:58] <Hyperking> the results is that the jqueryMagicElement is null, but when I use the .html() method
[07:53:09] <shoky> depends.. what's a domRealeleemnt and what's a jqueryMagicelement
[07:53:16] <Hyperking> the domRealElement will work
[07:54:22] <Hyperking> domRealelement = '.div-in-the-dom' and jqueryMagicelement = 'div-generated-by-jquery'
[07:54:37] <shoky> wtf does that mean
[07:54:51] <shoky> if both are divs
[07:54:52] <shoky> then it will work
[07:55:02] <Hyperking> yes, both are divs
[07:55:05] <shoky> and stop making up concepts
[07:55:10] <shoky> especially magic ones
[07:55:57] <Hyperking> ok
[07:56:03] <hugo_moss> how can i prefetch pages using jquery and ajax?
[07:56:39] <Hyperking> how do move an html dom element into a jquery generated element?
[07:56:49] <shoky> appendTo works
[07:56:57] <shoky> if you have a problem, make a jsfiddle
[07:57:04] <Hyperking> shoky: ^ will do
[08:08:52] <Hyperking> shoky: here is the fiddle, not sure why the markers aren't showing http://jsfiddle.net/VHUz8/
[08:09:49] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: Didn't include jQuery.
[08:11:10] <opie-wrk> so is it possible to handle the submitHandler in jquery.validate with an event?
[08:11:11] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: thanks http://jsfiddle.net/VHUz8/1/
[08:11:51] <BillCriswell> shoky: Got some spam from pimgus.
[08:12:08] <BillCriswell> I know you like kicking them. :)
[08:13:04] <Hyperking> In this example im using the .html() method which works but leaves the dom element on screen. the appendTo() would be best but Im getting an error
[08:15:07] <BillCriswell> I don't think there's a single thing I like about spammers. I don't normally feel that way about anything haha.
[08:16:35] <shoky> there's nothing to like about them ;p
[08:16:38] <decx> what about nazi accountants?
[08:19:31] <shoky> Hyperking: i don't see how appending anything would help you here.. as you're calling an API method bindPopup which expects either html or an element to be passed
[08:20:17] <jParkton> shoky: I have a json file I need to pull info from but there is xhtml error thing due to xss concerns in Chrome? I can just put the json info in my script and not call it from elsewhere right?
[08:21:31] <shoky> jParkton: no idea what you're doing or what error you're getting. also i am not your personal jquery assistant, there are many others here to help
[08:22:04] <jParkton> ok
[08:27:37] <hackal> Hello, I have several elements I would like to hide. I am calling .hide() individually on each one. Is here any way to select more elements at once with $()?
[08:28:24] <shoky> yes.
[08:28:51] <hackal> Oh silly me I just need to separate them with commas same as in css
[08:30:50] <BillCriswell> decx: I never thought about them.
[08:38:48] <BillCriswell> Hmm... there's an onbeforeprint event... about to just destroy the stylesheets on that event and call it the day.
[08:39:09] <BillCriswell> The amount of time I'm spending on print style sheets makes me so sad.
[08:39:45] <jParkton> lol
[08:39:52] <jParkton> poor guy
[08:40:02] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[08:40:43] * jParkton passes flamin hot cheetoos and whiskey
[08:41:14] <BillCriswell> mmm food.
[08:41:18] <erming> fewd
[08:41:34] <BillCriswell> Could go for a slice of pizza with some hot sauce right now.
[08:41:43] <jParkton> mmmm
[08:41:47] <jParkton> doit!
[08:42:35] <jParkton> How do I have a paragraph of text in a json doc?
[08:42:40] <jParkton> https://gist.github.com/jparkton/46e31db4052fadc81f95
[08:43:12] <jParkton> "body" fails
[08:43:15] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Wrap it in paragraph tags.
[08:43:31] <BillCriswell> jParkton: How?
[08:43:38] <erming> <p></p> go
[08:43:42] <jParkton> ah
[08:43:47] <jParkton> lemme shee
[08:43:48] <shoky> no <p> in json
[08:43:54] <shoky> jParkton that json is fine. what's the problem
[08:43:58] <erming> well, it's just a string
[08:44:03] <shoky> so?
[08:44:08] <jParkton> fails validation
[08:44:16] <jParkton> invalid json
[08:44:22] <jParkton> I WANT VALIDATIONDAMMIT
[08:44:32] <erming> the content of the string isn't really part of the json spec
[08:44:39] <jParkton> ah
[08:44:40] <erming> you're allowed to go crazy :>
[08:44:42] <jParkton> ok
[08:44:55] <BillCriswell> jParkton: What's the error?
[08:44:59] <erming> jParkton: your tab is probably what fails the json validator
[08:45:03] <erming> (my guess)
[08:45:11] <jParkton> 'brackets'
[08:45:19] <BillCriswell> Thinking it's something to do with: "metus nibh 	tempus nulla"
[08:45:25] <jParkton> lol
[08:45:32] <jParkton> dont hate on my latin
[08:45:33] <shoky> yeah it's the tab
[08:45:37] <jParkton> uncultured swine
[08:45:42] <erming> ah
[08:45:44] <BillCriswell> jParkton: The trailing , is no good actually.
[08:45:46] <erming> the last trailing
[08:45:46] <erming> ye
[08:46:03] <BillCriswell> jParkton: You should not be building JSON on your own.
[08:46:33] <erming> yeah, Bill will volunteer
[08:47:20] <BillCriswell> haha no way. Whatever language is on your server should have a json encode type deal.
[08:48:22] <jParkton> I just made it so I can use them in excersizes
[08:48:30] <jParkton> searching through strings and such
[08:48:40] <erming> btw jParkton: while searching the web for an explaination why the json-spec doesn't allow trailing commas
[08:48:42] <erming> i found this:
[08:48:56] <erming> http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html#comments
[08:49:09] <erming> they solve it by just chopping the string into an array instead
[08:49:42] <jParkton> yeah
[08:49:49] <jParkton> maybe I shall do that
[08:55:48] <jParkton> erming: well it validates now at least lol
[08:56:26] <frankenstein> Is it possible to submit an item for review to appear in this list? http://jquerymobile.com/resources/#Apps
[08:56:26] <duch_kazatel> friday fire drills!  yaaaay!
[08:56:28] <erming> proud of you son
[08:56:28] <erming> :D
[08:56:46] <EminenceHC> Does anyone know a good alternative to this two panel multiselect? http://loudev.com/#usage
[08:56:46] <jParkton> awww
[08:56:55] <erming> duch: hide in the bathroom
[08:56:57] <duch_kazatel> frankenstein might want to ask in #jquery-dev
[08:57:25] <frankenstein> duch_kazatel, thanks!
[08:57:40] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: This seems like it could just be a list of checkboxes?
[08:57:42] <duch_kazatel> erming nah, i actually kind of like it.
[08:57:55] <EminenceHC> BillCriswell: What?
[08:57:58] <decx> actually that would be #jquerymobile-dev frankenstein
[08:58:11] <duch_kazatel> didn't realize that's a channel!
[08:58:21] <decx> only saw it in the topic
[08:58:41] <duch_kazatel> man only 9 and all ready i'm killing it :D
[08:58:48] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC that two panel multiselect could be represented as checkboxes instead.
[08:59:15] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I don't want checkboxes though.. I want a two panel multiselect?
[08:59:41] <frankenstein> decx, thanks, I'll try asking there as well.
[08:59:44] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: What's the benefit here?
[09:00:03] <EminenceHC> BillCriswell: I have a lot of options, checkboxes take up too much room.
[09:00:24] <BillCriswell> You couldn't put them in a little scroll area?
[09:00:33] <duch_kazatel> lol exactly where my head was at.
[09:00:41] <duch_kazatel> you're just changing where the user has to scroll.
[09:03:32] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: BillCriswell: I would love to use that two panel multiselect but here is my problem. I am making an ajax call to fetch values which I append to a select. It works for a regular select/multiselect but when the multiselect is initialized it does not work for some reason. Maybe you know how I can change the syntax to make it work with this multiselect? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/cb479709cee6c9a34ef
[09:04:04] <duch_kazatel> 404 gist.
[09:04:07] <EminenceHC> BillCriswell: duch_kazatel: I see what you mean with checkboxes though that may be an alternative. The boss just really likes this two pane select.
[09:04:28] <EminenceHC> 404 gist?
[09:04:52] <duch_kazatel> that link is a 404.
[09:05:14] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Oh, try this one: https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/cb479709cee6c9a34ef2
[09:06:04] <duch_kazatel> .multiSelect('addOption', Hash)
[09:06:09] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want to use to add things.
[09:06:13] <duch_kazatel> according to the docs.
[09:06:15] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: http://jsbin.com/nuhubico/1/edit?html,css,js,output you could show him this haha
[09:06:47] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I saw that but I could only add one value. How can I add multiple values?
[09:06:50] <BillCriswell> or her*
[09:06:56] <BillCriswell> fuck I hate that I Do that.
[09:07:22] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC inside of your for loop...
[09:07:28] <EminenceHC> BillCriswell: You are safe its a him. But he will say "where are the dual panels?"
[09:07:52] <duch_kazatel> i'm so glad our management team lets the designers/developers do the work.
[09:07:52] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: $('#your-select').multiSelect('addOption', { value: 'test', text: 'test', index: 0, nested: 'optgroup_label' });
[09:08:01] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Must be nice.. :)
[09:08:09] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC okay?  that doesn't change my answer.
[09:08:45] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I guess I just don't understand the syntax for putting multiple values into that hash.
[09:08:48] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: I find this thing very confusing.
[09:08:56] <duch_kazatel> in your for loop duder.
[09:09:00] <duch_kazatel> what is so hard about that?
[09:09:17] <BillCriswell> Click an item and it basically disappears unless the list is short enough to see it added.
[09:09:44] <BillCriswell> Plus I didn't know it was scrollable for a while since OSX doesn't have scroll bars.
[09:10:00] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Oh.. deep. I was thinking i needed to put it all within that one call.. like a hash inside a hash.
[09:10:02] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Thanks
[09:10:05] <EminenceHC> derp**
[09:10:07] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC http://fixee.org/paste/vly1h5m/
[09:10:21] <duch_kazatel> change the value and text to whatever you want them to be.
[09:10:32] <duch_kazatel> but point out to your boss what BillCriswell was saying.
[09:11:34] <duch_kazatel> today's dailyjs post is fantastic, for those who might be interested.
[09:11:54] <BillCriswell> What did it say?
[09:12:16] <duch_kazatel> talks about Ramda and Two-Way Data Bindings.
[09:12:33] <erming> So, fastest (performance wise) way to get last child?
[09:12:40] <erming> talking about 1k+ elements
[09:13:02] <duch_kazatel> erming probably the :last-child selector.
[09:13:05] <shoky> getElementByID
[09:13:08] <duch_kazatel> ooh or that.
[09:13:11] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: How can I break apart "data" which is an array of numbers, and feed each one into the value of each addOption?
[09:13:12] <erming> $(".msg:last") vs $(".msg").last() vs $(".msg")[ messages.length -1 ]
[09:13:24] <BillCriswell> erming: $(document.querySelector('.el:last-child')) perhaps?
[09:13:26] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC not following.
[09:13:30] <BillCriswell> erming: Not those.
[09:13:36] <duch_kazatel> erming try .eq(-1)
[09:13:46] <BillCriswell> That has to get ALL .msg before returning the last.
[09:13:54] <erming> yeah, i dont want that
[09:13:58] <BillCriswell> Where :last-child is native and can just grab that one.
[09:14:01] <erming> ok, great
[09:14:03] <erming> i'll try that one
[09:14:07] <erming> thanks all
[09:14:44] <BillCriswell> No problemo
[09:14:44] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell is right - that's going to have a good performance bump, though over 1,000 elements might make that moot
[09:14:55] <erming> yeah, i had that in mind
[09:15:04] <erming> didn't want jQuery to somehow iterate all these elements
[09:15:28] <duch_kazatel> :last-child is a css3 selector iirc.  pay attention to older browsers.
[09:15:38] <duch_kazatel> though i cpould be totally wrong.
[09:15:53] <BillCriswell> I think last-child is an older one.
[09:16:02] <BillCriswell> :last-of-type and shit like that I think is new.
[09:16:12] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child - selectors level 3, IE 9 support.
[09:16:29] <BillCriswell> Shit you're right.
[09:16:39] <BillCriswell> Why do I feel like last-child is old.
[09:16:43] <BillCriswell> Ah, thinking first-child
[09:16:49] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: In the for loop I am supposed to feed in the value. How can I do that dynamically?
[09:16:59] <Hetachi> Need help with fixing this: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/5403609
[09:17:00] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC like you were before....
[09:17:22] <duch_kazatel> Hetachi can you set that up in a jsfiddle or jsbin instead?
[09:18:55] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I can't seem to add my variable "numbers" to replace value: 'test'.
[09:19:09] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/gugepuni/1/edit?html,js,output wonder why that takes so long to show up in the console.
[09:19:23] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC wat.  sure you can.  send me an updated gist.
[09:19:34] <Hetachi> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/rLKDV/
[09:19:45] <caricati> hello Hetachi, try this http://jsfiddle.net/DyZh3/2/
[09:20:07] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/cb479709cee6c9a34ef2
[09:20:13] <caricati> use window.onload event before
[09:20:39] <jParkton> This is not loading my json file but I see no errors is it just wrong? https://gist.github.com/jparkton/f044afad11a3d30ea691
[09:21:51] <BillCriswell> jParkton: Is there an error in the console, if not do console.log(data) in the callback and make sure it's what you think.
[09:22:14] <Hetachi> caricati: Thanks, but that is not quite what I needed, I have one problem like, I need it to redirect on click, this version does not work for me
[09:22:38] <jParkton> ahh
[09:22:41] <jParkton> ty
[09:22:43] <BillCriswell> jParkton: key would just be an index if that JSON is an array or objects. val would be the actual object.
[09:22:46] <BillCriswell> jParkton: No problem
[09:23:09] <jParkton> so am I calling it correctly if I am using that email json file?
[09:23:18] <jParkton> lemme log data and see lol
[09:23:58] <BillCriswell> console.log(data) would be able to tell you a lot more than I can haha
[09:24:01] <BillCriswell> Pizza time.
[09:24:09] <jParkton> mmm
[09:24:17] <jParkton> pizzer
[09:24:34] <jParkton> says data not defined
[09:24:42] <jParkton> something is out of scope I assume
[09:24:47] <EminenceHC> Careful.. pizza is a slippery slope towards crystal meth.
[09:24:53] <jParkton> lol
[09:24:53] <BillCriswell> Are you logging it INSIDE the callback?
[09:25:08] <jParkton> oh
[09:25:19] <jParkton> I just did it in console
[09:25:27] <jParkton> which would be out of scope
[09:25:29] <jParkton> lol
[09:25:31] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[09:25:37] <jParkton> man I fail at this so hard
[09:25:40] <jParkton> its fun
[09:26:03] <BillCriswell> If you're not failing you're not learning much haha.
[09:26:22] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Oh deep.. I was using strings. Sorry.
[09:26:37] <jParkton> that is true
[09:26:38] <EminenceHC> WHY DOES IT CORRECT DERP TO DEEP... THAT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE MEANING.
[09:26:55] <jParkton> a few months ago I couldnt even get past page three on eloquent javascript
[09:27:18] <jParkton> now im on page 4 \0/ lol
[09:27:44] <erming> ok, for those who are interested
[09:27:46] <erming> i made some tests: http://jsperf.com/last-child-vs-jquery-last/4
[09:28:16] <erming> :last-child selector is the way to go
[09:31:36] <erming> Added querySelector() to the test.. Gave ~13% more performance than plain jQuery
[09:31:39] <Hetachi> Any ideas why this isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/75zBx/ ?
[09:32:47] <duch_kazatel> erming i cheated and added parent[parent.length - 1];
[09:33:14] <jParkton> oh sad
[09:33:36] <jParkton> seems I am effected by this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4208530/xmlhttprequest-origin-null-is-not-allowed-access-control-access-allow-for-file
[09:33:42] <jParkton> affected?
[09:33:48] <erming> duch that gave me about 918 million runs / sec
[09:33:48] <erming> :D
[09:34:01] <jParkton> dang!
[09:34:03] <duch_kazatel> Hetachi should work fine - getting any console errors in your environment?
[09:34:06] <jParkton> thats a couple
[09:34:13] <erming> but
[09:34:18] <erming> parent[-1] = undefined
[09:34:20] <erming> thats why
[09:34:20] <erming> :D
[09:34:25] <erming> nvm
[09:34:29] <jParkton> lol
[09:34:30] <erming> it's parent[0] *
[09:34:37] <Hetachi> weirdly  no
[09:34:48] <Hetachi> it simply isn't working perhaps it's because of text ?
[09:34:59] <duch_kazatel> Hetachi what is the response from the server?
[09:35:00] <jParkton> more than likely wizards
[09:35:12] <jParkton> they always mess up code
[09:37:22] <jParkton> wow
[09:37:32] <duch_kazatel> such amaze
[09:37:35] <jParkton> so I have to run a node server to read from my json files
[09:37:46] <erming> much jquery
[09:37:50] <duch_kazatel> jParkton or any server.
[09:37:55] <jParkton> well yes
[09:37:57] <jParkton> lol
[09:38:01] <duch_kazatel> any server-side language can parse json.
[09:38:06] <duch_kazatel> but you just need to serve them, right?
[09:38:22] <jParkton> I mean Chrome blocks my json unless its being 'served'
[09:38:25] <duch_kazatel> right.
[09:38:32] <jParkton> meh
[09:38:40] <duch_kazatel> https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
[09:38:45] <duch_kazatel> that's what stuff like this is for.
[09:38:48] <jParkton> hey, its part of the learning process I guess
[09:38:57] <duch_kazatel> or you can just install and run apache locally.
[09:39:03] <duch_kazatel> not that hard to do.  tons of options.
[09:39:13] <jParkton> if I was gonna do that I would just host it on my server
[09:39:25] <duch_kazatel> then do that :)
[09:39:31] <jParkton> using node http is fast!
[09:40:59] <Ownix> I attach a focusout() handler to a collection of items $(".my-class").focustout(...); and inside that function i EDIT the list by cloning an item and appending it back in
[09:41:14] <Hetachi> Sorry about that it required and existing file...
[09:41:15] <Ownix> How do I refresh that and attach a new focusout() to my newly cloned and added item?
[09:41:15] <shoky> edit what list
[09:41:30] <Ownix> $(".my-class")
[09:41:40] <Ownix> iS an array of Jquery objects
[09:41:53] <duch_kazatel> Ownix use event delegation instead >:D
[09:42:06] <Ownix> Where can I learn about deligation?
[09:42:11] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[09:42:12] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:42:13] <decx> delegate before you generate
[09:42:25] <decx> i'm not a rapper
[09:42:43] <cannap> hi
[09:42:45] <Ownix> on vs http://api.jquery.com/delegate/?
[09:43:02] <decx> the term delegation includes on
[09:43:08] <duch_kazatel> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[09:43:13] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:43:49] <cannap> can any tell me how i get the current value from .confirm when i click the link i only get the first but i klicked the second one http://laravel.io/bin/xWJ9N
[09:44:21] <decx> there is a confirm() ?
[09:44:30] <cannap> jquery
[09:44:36] <cannap> plugin
[09:44:55] <decx> attr is the culprit
[09:44:56] <cannap> but i cant read the current data-username value from the link i clicked
[09:44:59] <cannap> i get the first in the list
[09:45:05] <decx> it will only return the first of a collection
[09:45:26] <cannap> hm
[09:45:48] <cannap> and now? :D
[09:47:04] <cannap> look here i clicked  fefe http://cl.ly/image/083x1R1l0d34
[09:47:11] <cannap> and got the fewfwe
[09:47:56] <shoky> cannap: use .each to loop over them  $(".confirm").each(function() { $(this).confirm({... title: ... + $(this).attr(..)  +.... }); })
[09:48:44] <cannap> what the fuck and for what is this?
[09:48:50] <cannap> i mean "this"
[09:48:51] <EminenceHC> How can I parse: [["Jaime Cunningham",7],["John Goodman",66],["Mike Jackson",69]] into a name and id variables?
[09:48:54] <shoky> manners, cannap
[09:48:57] <BillCriswell> lol
[09:49:04] <duch_kazatel> cannap it's the current element.
[09:49:20] <decx> what do you think ('.confirm', this) does?
[09:49:21] <cannap> yea i want the data-username from the current element
[09:49:27] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC array[0][0] = name, array[0][1] = id
[09:49:28] <cannap> when is use this
[09:49:30] <decx> this is confirm isnt it
[09:49:32] <cannap> undefined
[09:49:42] <shoky> cannap inside the .each it will be defined
[09:49:53] <decx> so it's $('.confirm','.confirm')
[09:49:58] <decx> does that even work?
[09:50:11] <shoky> whut
[09:50:17] <decx> then again maybe that plugin does something fucky?
[09:50:33] <BillCriswell> fucky is the best adjective.
[09:50:35] <shoky> are you asking about his code or mine
[09:51:06] <decx> i mean that laravel paste
[09:51:17] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC http://jsfiddle.net/baE7Z/
[09:51:22] <shoky> decx it's bad code
[09:51:24] <decx> isn't it BillCriswell
[09:51:26] <shoky> why ask about it ;p
[09:51:44] <decx> it's friday and halftime, gotta get worked up about something
[09:52:04] <BillCriswell> What time is it in Germany?
[09:52:12] <BillCriswell> Noon?
[09:52:20] <BillCriswell> or are we talking about the soccer thing
[09:52:20] <decx> also i saw umlauts so i'm like bound by law to help out
[09:52:22] <duch_kazatel> around 4:30 or 5?
[09:52:23] <shoky> oo indeed it's friday. i should get ready for dinner
[09:52:29] <decx> [18:52:03] < BillCriswell> What time is it in Germany?
[09:52:50] <Hyperking> looking for geojson data for county district in nebraska any suggestions?
[09:52:50] <BillCriswell> shoky: Only eat dinner on Friday?
[09:53:00] <decx> that how you keep shape over 30
[09:53:09] <decx> 's
[09:53:12] <duch_kazatel> dammit i was off it's closer to 7pm
[09:53:15] <shoky> BillCriswell with my family yeah
[09:53:16] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Thanks that makes a lot of sense now.
[09:53:22] <BillCriswell> shoky: Oh.
[09:53:33] <shoky> well, sometimes other days too but almost always on friday eve
[09:53:43] <EGreg> hey guys
[09:53:45] <EGreg> and girls
[09:53:47] <EGreg> question!
[09:53:54] <BillCriswell> shoky: The  way it was worded I thought you only ate dinner on Fridays.
[09:54:39] <EGreg> https://www.dropbox.com/s/mi0nforzgzjsg9e/Screenshot%202014-06-13%2012.54.38.png
[09:54:41] <shoky> i'm not that silly. now excuse me, time for my annual shower
[09:54:51] <EGreg> How can this happen? I thought jQuery 1.11 supported IE8 and only jQuery 2 didn't
[09:54:55] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ EGreg
[09:54:55] <b-ot> EGreg: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:55:27] <EGreg> You can see my code at http://qbix.com, but in IE8 it breaks
[09:55:32] <BillCriswell> Showers are overrated.
[09:55:36] <decx> i don't see anything unusual here shoky, i've been to a tech conference once
[09:55:41] <EGreg> jQuery breaks because apparently Element.prototype.contains is an OBJECT not a function
[09:55:45] <duch_kazatel> EGreg the specific code you're having trouble with would be baller.
[09:55:54] <duch_kazatel> EGreg functions are objects ;)
[09:56:03] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're passing things around wrong potentially.
[09:56:26] <shoky> decx if that's the end of your joke then i don't get it, but i like it
[09:56:44] <decx> nerds stink?`
[09:56:53] <shoky> ah
[09:56:55] <decx> i know it's the lowest of fruits sorry :(
[09:57:20] <BillCriswell> You have to hang out with the designer crowd. They smell nice.
[09:57:38] <EGreg> duch_kazatel: it tries to CALL the object as a function!
[09:57:40] <decx> when you inhale all your farts that comes naturally
[09:57:41] <shoky> srsly tho, i stink
[09:58:10] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha we were having a dept. meeting once and somebody walked in, took a big whiff, and said "smells like SoDev" then left.
[09:58:17] <duch_kazatel> it was p. gross
[09:58:45] <duch_kazatel> EGreg the specifc code you're having trouble with please and thank you - i'd rather not dump through your entire site.
[09:58:48] <BillCriswell> Damn WinSCP keeps trying to sync node_modules
[09:58:56] <BillCriswell> JerkSCP is more like it.
[09:59:09] <BillCriswell> FailSCP*
[09:59:11] <BillCriswell> HAAA
[09:59:12] <duch_kazatel> mootools?  more like BOOtools amirite
[09:59:19] <BillCriswell> Hahaha
[09:59:29] <decx> o/
[09:59:31] <EGreg> duch_kazatel here it is: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mi0nforzgzjsg9e/Screenshot%202014-06-13%2012.54.38.png
[09:59:33] <BillCriswell> Wow, for windows it's really easy to make a bad joke like that.
[09:59:42] <EGreg> I don't touch these objects, it's all jQuery
[09:59:52] <BillCriswell> Oddly enough I never heard "losedows"
[09:59:55] <EGreg> jQuery breaks because apparently Element.prototype.contains is an OBJECT not a function, but is being called as a function
[09:59:58] <decx> more like losedows am i rite
[10:00:02] <decx> aaww come on
[10:00:18] <w00tb3ast> anyone know a good / fast script that blurs images that works in an android webview?
[10:00:31] <duch_kazatel> EGreg except that you're calling jquery from somewhere.  so your code might be passing things around incorrectly.
[10:00:32] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: css filters maybe?
[10:00:50] <duch_kazatel> anybody else want to take a crack at EGreg's screenshot/website?
[10:00:50] <BillCriswell> w00tb3ast: I don't know shit about android webview though.
[10:00:51] <Hetachi> is it possible to detect with jquery when a new tab/window opens ?
[10:00:52] <BillCriswell> Whatever that is.
[10:00:57] <decx> css blur + svg blur polyfill
[10:01:33] <EGreg> duch_kazatel aha maybe one of my other libraries redefines Element.prototype.contains, gotta check
[10:02:44] <decx> BillCriswell it's that thing that opens websites without using the actual browser. all in the sake to keep people inside apps
[10:02:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah, sounds about right.
[10:03:08] <BillCriswell> I'm going to slide up iFrames on sites I build from now on.
[10:03:34] <decx> yo frameset that
[10:04:29] <dave_2> hi can anyone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/xDfYE/, if any of td  in current tr is clicked the respective radio box should be checked and also below it should show which radio box is checked
[10:04:46] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 cool - what have you tried?
[10:06:15] <EGreg> found the error, thanks
[10:06:19] <dave_2> above link maybe giving 404 http://jsfiddle.net/xDfYE/ here you go
[10:06:21] <EGreg> another library was redefining .contains
[10:07:49] <duch_kazatel> EGreg what lib was it?
[10:07:56] <EGreg> It was my own :P
[10:08:00] <BillCriswell> Haaaaa
[10:08:01] <EGreg> Which I am fixing now
[10:08:02] <BillCriswell> Happens.
[10:08:09] <EGreg> :)
[10:08:10] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 again, what javascript code have you tried?
[10:08:57] <decx> this code /join #jquery
[10:09:04] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[10:10:38] <dave_2> duch_kazatel, i deleted what i tried let me write down there, but i was failed to achieve what i was trying
[10:11:17] <BillCriswell> dave_2: He just wants to make sure you're trying basically haha.
[10:11:56] <BillCriswell> dave_2: Your HTML isn't making this task very clean.
[10:15:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell is right.
[10:15:51] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 it's nice to see where you're head's at.  it's easier to provide guidance with that in mind.
[10:20:25] <dave_2> now better http://jsfiddle.net/xDfYE/3/ ?
[10:21:26] <duch_kazatel> lol i was curious to see waht javascript you attempted to solve your problem.
[10:23:20] <BillCriswell> This task feels weird to me.
[10:23:36] <decx> when clicking on a td you want to trigger a click on the label in that tr
[10:23:42] <duch_kazatel> it's terribly weird - i remember the site he was working on.  it was really awkward.
[10:23:45] <decx> now just reformat that sentence in jquery and it's done
[10:23:48] <tell3r> i want a fixed header to hide partly with scroll: https://gist.github.com/obama/a56a73e5337cc0fe1e11 problem is when reloading at a scrolled position, it does now trigger the scroll() event
[10:24:04] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, but if the click comes from that label?
[10:24:16] <decx> well good thing it'S a radio button is it
[10:24:30] <decx> double label click dont matter
[10:24:33] <Nach0z> tell3r: perhaps on page load check to see where your current position is
[10:24:53] <Nach0z> if you're not at the top, scroll()?
[10:25:02] <duch_kazatel> or triggerHandler()
[10:25:15] <tell3r> Nach0z: calling jQuery(window).scroll(); should execute the event, but it doesnt the way i put it there..
[10:25:16] <BillCriswell> Good point.
[10:25:21] <tell3r> when i doit via console it works
[10:25:24] * Nach0z has no idea <__>
[10:25:26] <BillCriswell> Wich checkboxes it's annoying then haha
[10:26:08] <decx> if (!$(e.target).is('label') || $(e.target).closest('label').length) or something
[10:26:10] <decx> ^^
[10:26:18] <duch_kazatel> you can also check if the event was synthetically triggered.
[10:26:23] <decx> oh?
[10:27:10] <BillCriswell> Guess you could check event mouse jawns?
[10:27:20] <duch_kazatel> e.originalEvent
[10:27:48] <decx> huh interesting
[10:27:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/xDfYE/4/ hacky.
[10:27:57] <duch_kazatel> but it works.
[10:28:20] <tell3r> Nach0z: i think the problem is my cache was not updated...
[10:28:37] <Nach0z> that'd do it
[10:28:59] <decx> what was that new method to get the element at a specific location?`
[10:29:03] <decx> elementatpoint?
[10:29:13] <decx> from
[10:29:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah.
[10:30:05] <decx> yesterday i was thinking what useless junk and today i need it
[10:30:23] <decx> baader meinhofed
[10:30:27] <tell3r> damn it was not the cache :(
[10:30:58] <dave_2> duch_kazatel thanks man, now need to learn about e.originalEvent :P and trigger to
[10:31:14] <duch_kazatel> dave_2 in the future, leave in the javascript you tried.
[10:32:15] <dave_2> duch_kazatel sure sir , one more thing how do i show selected vehicle (checkbox)
[10:32:17] <duch_kazatel> oh, it's friday the 13th.
[10:32:21] <Ownix> :o
[10:32:24] <Ownix> Yes it is
[10:32:36] <json_vorhees> dave_2 not sure what you mean.
[10:33:13] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to combine iScroll 5 with jQuery Infinite Scroll Helper: Chrome => Inspect element => Drawer => Emulation => Apple iPhone 5: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/7zCL2/21/embedded/result/
[10:33:26] <frank_o> I'm almost there, but why won't `myScroll.refresh();` update the scrolling area after the new content has arrived?
[10:34:43] <dave_2> i mean i wanted to append selected radiobox to selected vehicle div below the table
[10:35:48] <json_vorhees> check out .append()
[10:37:16] <decx> like this for example http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xDfYE/5/
[10:38:17] <decx> i switched back to label click from input to spare one lookup for the text
[10:38:18] <islalobo> Hello, I am looking for a little help with trying to expand a text area
[10:38:32] <decx> you grab the little expand thing in the bottom right and drag
[10:38:41] <decx> ^^
[10:38:42] <json_vorhees> or .text() that works too.
[10:39:42] <islalobo> decx with js
[10:40:17] <decx> you console.log('hello'), then you grab the little expand thing in the bottom right and drag
[10:40:28] <json_vorhees> are you trying to do it automatically, islalobo?
[10:40:40] <json_vorhees> because a google search is turning up results for that.
[10:40:46] <decx> it has css properties like any old element
[10:40:51] <decx> use them
[10:41:02] <islalobo> json_vorhees: sorry I am just beginning
[10:41:17] <json_vorhees> !g expand textarea js
[10:41:18] <b-ot> json_vorhees: Expanding Textareas - bgrins on Github → http://bgrins.github.io/ExpandingTextareas/
[10:41:25] <tell3r> Nach0z: the problem was that i pasted old code from the unminified file, that didnt check what you said... -.-
[10:41:34] <json_vorhees> there's one option.  you can also set .css() on it.
[10:42:53] <decx> that would have been a penalty yesterday
[10:43:02] <decx> wait, wrong network
[10:43:05] <decx> *.*
[10:43:14] <json_vorhees> or you could set the cols and rows.
[10:43:41] <json_vorhees> nah we had that discussion the other day - avoid setting specific css properties with javascript.  this is one of the exceptions to that.
[10:44:10] <islalobo> Okay, I guess I should have asked what function will allow me to create an collapsible list
[10:44:25] <json_vorhees> islalobo that's... a totally different question.
[10:44:30] <json_vorhees> can you show us what you're trying to do?
[10:45:03] <decx> huh how are those even related :o
[10:46:07] <json_vorhees> they are just beginning, you see.
[10:48:58] <islalobo> They are related. I was describing the same thing. I think I found an example I can work off: http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/expand.html
[10:50:00] <json_vorhees> islalobo a "text area" and "a list" are completely independent concepts - those describe two specific tags.  are you just trying to vertically expand a container?
[10:50:08] <decx> man, toggle('slow') is terrible
[10:53:14] <islalobo> json_vorhees: yes, we have a list that is divided by categories. Each category is its own div
[10:54:27] <decx> basicly define an area where you catch expand clicks and build a relation to its hidden container with the expanding content
[10:54:45] <decx> primitive http://jsfiddle.net/decx/zjaJT/
[10:55:05] <json_vorhees> mmk.  fyi <textarea> is an actual tag.  and there are 2 specific "list" tags.  so you need to be careful how you describe what you're looking to do.
[10:55:50] <BillCriswell> Reading about the vigesimal math for whatever reason.
[10:55:59] <BillCriswell> I wish I was a numbers guy sometimes haha
[10:56:11] <islalobo> decx why would I choose expandthis over toggle?
[10:56:21] <decx> wat
[10:56:37] <json_vorhees> islalobo lol that uses .toggle()
[10:56:42] <tell3r> BillCriswell: what is that?
[10:56:44] <json_vorhees> read the code ;)
[10:56:44] <decx> toggle is a method, .expandthis is a class name
[10:57:03] <BillCriswell> It's base 20 with like... shells, bars and dots.
[10:57:11] <decx> anything going beyond my fingers is off
[10:57:16] <islalobo> sorry, I am rushing. i'll slow down and stop asking unnecessary questions!
[10:57:27] <BillCriswell> It's stacked instead of left to right. Pretty odd to me.
[10:57:42] <islalobo> json_vorhees++
[10:57:45] <tell3r> BillCriswell: google yields only 2 links? something with mayan number system?
[10:57:46] <islalobo> decx++
[10:58:00] <json_vorhees> BillCriswell woah this is nutty.
[10:58:05] <json_vorhees> islalobo you'll learn :)
[10:58:10] <decx> 2 links?
[10:58:11] <BillCriswell> tell3r: Yes.
[10:58:13] <Ansikt> BillCriswell: Isn't that what the Aztec used?
[10:58:17] <decx> About 35,000 results
[10:58:22] <BillCriswell> It only showed you two links is weird though lol
[10:58:27] <tell3r> i have a mirc script that tells me the current mayan long count date xD 13.0.1.8.19
[10:58:58] <json_vorhees> woah.  base 20 is relatively common.
[10:58:59] <Ansikt> I used to have a myan calander conky setup
[10:59:09] <decx> the danish use base 20
[10:59:23] <json_vorhees> lots of african tribes, too.  an inuits.
[10:59:25] <decx> 60 is 3x20
[10:59:35] <decx> iirc
[10:59:54] <json_vorhees> Bhutan.  this is batty stuff.
[11:00:03] <decx> 51 is one and 2,5 x 20
[11:00:05] <BillCriswell> So that would be like ... and a shell under it.
[11:00:33] <BillCriswell> So many things I want to learn for no good reason.
[11:01:05] <decx> you never know when you get obducted by aliens and serve as the sole example of humanity
[11:01:31] <BillCriswell> I couldn't handle that pressure. I'd rather a dissection.
[11:01:41] <json_vorhees> lmao
[11:01:45] <json_vorhees> BillCriswell++
[11:01:46] <BillCriswell> Unless aliens are listening... in that case take someone else.
[11:01:52] <decx> the aliens be like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZqo4OZ0Pqs
[11:02:10] <BillCriswell> decx: hahaha
[11:03:11] <BillCriswell> Scott Steiners arms used to give me nightmares.
[11:03:26] <BillCriswell> I'd rather be fat than built like that.
[11:04:28] <decx> that's what happens when you inject toy tractors
[11:05:07] <aro> with bootstrap3, is there a way to trigger a modal programmatically without having to insert some content to the dom
[11:05:30] <json_vorhees> huh?
[11:05:42] <json_vorhees> you mean without having an element first?
[11:05:46] <aro> yes
[11:06:02] <json_vorhees> nope.  you have to have something to show.
[11:06:13] <json_vorhees> you might be able to pass a string of markup to the selector instead.
[11:06:24] <aro> what selector?
[11:06:27] <json_vorhees> but that'll insert something to the dom.
[11:06:42] <aro> i dont care that it inserts stuff to the dom
[11:06:43] <json_vorhees> $('<div>here's a thing</div>')
[11:06:50] <aro> i just dont see why i have to do it first, and then call the modal
[11:06:57] <EminenceHC> I have an ajax call which grabs data from the server and populates a multiselect. It works great however I can't seem to clear the previous values when inputting the new ones. How can I empty the multiselect before it is populated? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/f7dc312801684858dd28
[11:06:59] <aro> it seems like its adding an extra step for the developer
[11:07:15] <json_vorhees> aro because there's no harm in adding things to your markup.
[11:07:45] <json_vorhees> aro it's the same amount of work either way.
[11:07:52] <BillCriswell> He had the best move in the the N64 wrestling game. I think it was revenge?
[11:08:13] <BillCriswell> He just put you up in a supplex and dropped you directly on the top of your head.
[11:10:13] <json_vorhees> that sounds terrifying
[11:10:41] <BillCriswell> Trying to find a video of it... can't find it.
[11:10:50] <duch_kazatel> i'
[11:10:54] <BillCriswell> I think it was just for the gam ehaha
[11:11:19] <duch_kazatel> *i'll bet somebody out there has a video of all the special moves from that game.
[11:12:37] <BillCriswell> I wish I stil had it.
[11:12:56] <BillCriswell> I'd spend hours packed around a 15" TV playing 4 players with my friends.
[11:13:53] <decx> you know emulators have online support nowadays
[11:13:59] <duch_kazatel> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/510343979/destroy-only-copy-of-new-wu-tang-album
[11:14:36] <decx> i like it
[11:15:13] <decx> that whole ordeal is fishy
[11:15:43] <decx> the album must be terrible if they want to make it into an art statement instead
[11:16:05] <systemfault> I would do this with all rap records :P
[11:16:21] <decx> that's just ignorant
[11:16:55] <BillCriswell> I won't to hear it lol
[11:17:07] <duch_kazatel> something tells me it'll be like every other wu-tang record.
[11:18:15] <BillCriswell> wan't*
[11:18:18] <BillCriswell> want*
[11:18:19] <BillCriswell> wow.
[11:18:58] <BillCriswell> I might have to look into an emulator just to see this move.
[11:20:23] <decx> no worries i got it
[11:20:25] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/oAT8zOY.gif
[11:21:12] <socialblogsite> Is there any known way to update jQuery objects (e.g. Li items in an UL) so the functions defined for the events of each element relying on their index number keep working without having to re-define all the events with their new index number?
[11:21:35] <EminenceHC> decx: epic
[11:21:42] <decx> sounds like you're doing something fucky there
[11:23:29] <BillCriswell> Found it.
[11:23:53] <hocza> hm I'm trying to fill fields with $(.class).each + .getJSON, however inside getJSON i can't use the $(this) nor I can store it in a cb = $(this) because of nonblocking it will only refresh the last field.
[11:23:55] <hocza> :(
[11:24:23] <BillCriswell> decx: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVQBy6zQgtc not from the game but still pretty close haha
[11:24:33] <BillCriswell> At least he stabilized their head slightly here.
[11:24:54] <hocza> any hint, how to do it? :)
[11:24:55] <decx> jesus
[11:25:22] <BillCriswell> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8RUPAj0vxM OW
[11:26:35] <BillCriswell> He actually held on to him since falling at free fall I guess wasn't fast enough lol
[11:33:59] <johannesrudolph> hey
[11:34:16] <johannesrudolph> i have a problem with the position of an ui-dialog
[11:34:27] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ hocza
[11:34:28] <b-ot> hocza: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:35:02] <johannesrudolph> it is always at the top
[11:35:17] <johannesrudolph> when i take a look a with firebug
[11:35:44] <johannesrudolph> in element.style is "top: 0"
[11:35:57] <johannesrudolph> i don't know why
[11:36:18] <duch_kazatel> johannesrudolph what exactly are you trying to do?
[11:36:24] <duch_kazatel> place it somewhere else?
[11:36:32] <BillCriswell> Where did fixee come from?
[11:36:39] <johannesrudolph> yes that is what i want but it don't work
[11:36:46] <frank_o> those dialogs are tricky
[11:36:52] <johannesrudolph> only in the 'x' direction
[11:37:08] <duch_kazatel> then override the css.
[11:37:10] <johannesrudolph> for example in the dialog option
[11:37:14] <johannesrudolph> position: [150,128]
[11:37:27] <johannesrudolph> it is on top:0 and not on 128
[11:38:17] <duch_kazatel> johannesrudolph http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[11:45:04] <duch_kazatel> i forgot all about the sibling css selector.
[11:45:18] <decx> ~?
[11:45:24] <duch_kazatel> +
[11:45:31] <decx> ah
[11:46:08] <duch_kazatel> it was one of those things where I wanted something to have certain styling ONLY when preceded by another element.
[11:46:10] <drej> + is adjacent sibling
[11:46:14] <drej> yeah
[11:46:20] <duch_kazatel> yeah exactly.
[11:46:20] <drej> duch_kazatel i just wrote this selector .skeleton:not(.active) .sidebar input:checked + label { ... }
[11:46:35] <duch_kazatel> wow.  that's... different.
[11:46:51] <decx> it was a bit confusing that you cant go backwards any way but it makes sense as the document goes from top to bottom
[11:46:58] <decx> with ~ that is
[11:47:51] <drej> duch_kazatel comes in handy for one of my favourite hacks i wrote
[11:47:51] <drej> http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/UQj3q/7/
[11:47:54] <decx> why not give the input a class drej
[11:47:54] <drej> "hacks"
[11:48:09] <drej> because its conditional
[11:48:15] <drej> based on the .skeleton's state
[11:48:21] <drej> nothing to do with the input
[11:48:32] <decx> i just mean for selector efficiency
[11:48:38] <decx> like like '.class:checked + label','skeleton:not(.active)'
[11:49:44] <decx> where do i report spammers on freenode?
[11:49:53] <drej> the whole point is to not use javascript
[11:50:08] <decx> oh lol i thought it was a js selector
[11:50:13] <drej> nope, its css
[11:50:14] <decx> disregard what i wrote, i suck dicks
[11:50:21] <drej> :)
[11:50:23] <duch_kazatel> decx i usually go to #freenode and tell them about it.
[11:50:29] <drej> shoky vladikoff ajpiano
[11:50:31] <duch_kazatel> make sure you point out the spammer is PMing you.
[11:50:32] <drej> got spammer again
[11:50:35] <drej> pimgus is the nick
[11:50:42] <decx> yes
[11:50:44] <decx> that's the one
[11:51:00] <BillCriswell> He got me earlier decx. I thought he was gone haha.
[11:51:09] <litropy> I'm using jquery mobile. When I load my page, the page does load, but the loading icon overlay is present.
[11:51:25] <litropy> I'm testing locally
[11:51:25] <drej> BillCriswell they've been coming in here for ac ouple days now
[11:51:33] <drej> litropy run it on a server
[11:51:39] <drej> not from just a local file in your browser
[11:51:55] <litropy> drej, do you think that's the issue?
[11:52:08] <drej> no i dont, i just said it out loud because i have nothing better to do
[11:52:18] <litropy> drej, because index.js does have functions to, for instance, turn off AJAX when running locally
[11:52:36] <drej> its the first step i would take to debug
[11:52:39] <drej> if that doesnt work, go from there
[11:52:43] <litropy> thx, drej
[11:53:14] <BillCriswell> drej: Someone got him haha
[11:53:17] <BillCriswell> K-LINED
[11:53:25] <drej> nice
[11:53:36] <drej> although they've cycled a few IPs
[11:53:42] <drej> so im not sure how well that would hold
[11:56:22] <BillCriswell> I'd love to know the benefit of doing it hear.
[11:56:23] <BillCriswell> here*
[11:56:27] <BillCriswell> Dammit language.
[11:57:09] <duch_kazatel> dammit i missed a k-line?!
[11:57:12] <duch_kazatel> those are always fun.
[11:57:57] <decx> i take full credit for going to freenode and writing one thing about it then leaving immidiately
[11:58:01] <decx> #freenode*
[11:58:16] <Jattenalle> it's that easy?
[11:58:24] <duch_kazatel> they tend to confirm first.
[11:58:31] * Jattenalle goes to #freenode and tells them about the pesky decx "spambot"
[11:58:33] <Jattenalle> :3
[11:58:41] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:58:49] <decx> that's the logical next step i agree
[12:00:36] <BillCriswell> "SHowing Paint Rectangles" in chrome feels like the matric.
[12:00:42] <BillCriswell> matrix*
[12:01:12] <systemfault> BillCriswell: WHere is that option now? Can’t find it.
[12:01:36] <BillCriswell> It's in that console where you have to hit "escape" to get to it.
[12:01:38] <systemfault> Ah.. found it, that weird icon near the gear one
[12:01:43] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[12:02:02] <BillCriswell> I don't understand that setup at all.
[12:02:10] <decx> i'm confused about it every time
[12:02:39] <BillCriswell> Wonder why they're not just all across the top.
[12:02:41] <systemfault> Neither I… chrome and safari are two browser that managed to make their dev tools confusing while they were fine before.
[12:02:47] <decx> where's emulation, oh right i have to drag it up like i'm a sherpa
[12:03:05] <Jattenalle> lol
[12:03:12] <Jattenalle> look who's back
[12:03:16] <Jattenalle> it's our favorite spambot!
[12:03:18] <BillCriswell> Haha
[12:03:28] <Jattenalle> he literally spammed me the second he joined
[12:03:30] <Jattenalle> D:
[12:03:45] <BillCriswell> I didn't get anything yet.
[12:03:48] <Jattenalle> you wanna do another #freenode drive-by decx?
[12:03:51] <Jattenalle> or should i?
[12:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> ChrisAntaki: Keep the PRs coming :-)
[12:04:07] <decx> i've done my good thing for today Jattenalle
[12:04:20] <decx> back to being evil
[12:04:20] <BillCriswell> decx: It's using this: http://www.ircap.com/
[12:04:30] <BillCriswell> wonder if there's anything we can do to trick it into exploding.
[12:08:53] <hackal> Hello here is small example http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/2/. after clicking on #delete I need to select that div according to its ID. however that ID is always different since it is generated.
[12:09:44] <Jattenalle> *** pimgus quit (K-Lined )
[12:09:47] <Jattenalle> mission success
[12:09:56] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Is it possible to do a find() with a condition on a data- attribute?
[12:10:10] <duch_kazatel> hackal can you add a class to that parent one?
[12:10:24] <duch_kazatel> ecky-ptang-zoobo what's the condition?
[12:10:32] <BillCriswell> hackal: .closest('.panel') should get you there.
[12:10:38] <jphase> ecky-ptang-zoobo: sure, what's the condition?
[12:10:50] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> data-status="1" - I need to find all elements with a class of .foo and with a data-status="1"
[12:11:10] <duch_kazatel> ecky-ptang-zoobo is that set with .data(), or is that an actual attribute?
[12:11:14] <jphase> ecky-ptang-zoobo: .find('.foo[data-status="1"]')
[12:11:21] <BillCriswell> hackal: http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/3/ like this?
[12:11:25] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> duch_kazatel: it can be both
[12:11:38] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> some are initialized in the html, some are set with data
[12:11:48] <duch_kazatel> that's a little trickier - .data() doesn't reflect in HTML iirc.
[12:12:02] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok i'll try
[12:12:22] <duch_kazatel> you might have to .each() over your .foo()
[12:12:31] <duch_kazatel> this is why selecting on data attributes is a bad idea :)
[12:12:32] <hackal> BillCriswell: Thank you that is OK. and what does the .preventDefault() do?
[12:12:32] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> it doesn't??
[12:12:36] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> damn
[12:12:37] <duch_kazatel> ecky-ptang-zoobo nope.
[12:12:42] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> I thought it also set the attribute
[12:12:49] <BillCriswell> hackal: It keeps it from following the link.
[12:13:05] <hackal> BillCriswell: thank you very much
[12:13:07] <BillCriswell> Just did that cause I thought maybe it would link to something like /items/delete/xxxx
[12:13:15] <BillCriswell> hackal: No problem.
[12:15:46] <Tad3j> could anyone give me a suggestion why "$('#myform')[0].submit();" doesn't submit the form after ajax success?
[12:16:44] <jphase> Tad3j: you shouldn't need [0]
[12:17:07] <duch_kazatel> also, [0] accesses the underlying dom node, not the jquery object version.
[12:17:33] <Tad3j> if I don't use that I have problems with recurrsion
[12:17:36] <duch_kazatel> but ID selectors shouldn't need the [0] - there should only be one node with that ID.
[12:17:51] <duch_kazatel> Tad3j do you have a handler bound to .submit()?
[12:18:02] <Tad3j> yes duch_kazatel
[12:18:20] <duch_kazatel> you need to instead detect if the event was synthetically triggered or not.
[12:18:32] <Tad3j> I use to to validate html5 form and send an ajax request, before form is submitted
[12:18:38] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, you can set up a separate handler that you manually call after you e.preventDefault();
[12:18:47] <hackal> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/7/ I realized that I need to get ID of that div because I will be sending it through socket io to also remove it on back end from DB so this is solution I was looking for
[12:19:20] <BillCriswell> hackal: Sweet. I thought you just wanted to remove the element.
[12:19:42] <Tad3j> duch_kazatel, how would I detect that?
[12:19:54] <duch_kazatel> Tad3j do the second version - it's much saner.
[12:21:27] <Tad3j> duch_kazatel, not sure I fully understand that approach
[12:21:57] <Tad3j> currently if form is valid I execute a script for upload, which has it's own success method, where I also want the 2nd submission to happen
[12:22:05] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[12:23:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZcwKU/
[12:23:57] <duch_kazatel> basically, don't fire the ajax handler stuff to the submit event - create a separate function and call it explicitly.
[12:25:32] <Tad3j> hm..will that solve the problem where form is not submitted?
[12:25:33] <aro> can you use $.load() to send post data?
[12:25:43] <duch_kazatel> Tad3j the whatnot?
[12:25:55] <Tad3j> because it doesn't now :)
[12:25:57] <duch_kazatel> aro $.load() executes a .get() iirc.
[12:26:14] <duch_kazatel> Tad3j huh? what submission?
[12:26:16] <aro> ok
[12:26:43] <Tad3j> duch_kazatel, form submission
[12:27:09] <duch_kazatel> Tad3j what problem do you have when the form isn't submitted?
[12:28:26] <Tad3j> when the real submit is clicked validation is triggered, and if ok that ajax call is made. Inside that ajax sucess method I have another .submit(), which should actually submit the form (clicking the submit button actually performs async upload)
[12:29:00] <duch_kazatel> "which should actually submit the form" - why?  i thought you were doing things via ajax?
[12:29:04] <duch_kazatel> can you share your code?
[12:29:04] <Tad3j> that another .submit triggers the .submit event if executed there, so I'm looking for alternative
[12:29:22] <decx> dont use each to check data
[12:29:27] <decx> oh i was scrolled up
[12:30:01] <Tad3j> duch_kazatel, I only upload a file via ajax
[12:30:11] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Tad3j
[12:30:11] <b-ot> Tad3j: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:30:14] <Tad3j> then I submit the form with data returned by that ajax
[12:30:20] <duch_kazatel> i'm obviously not grepping something here.
[12:30:30] <Tad3j> I will, just wanted to answer before I do that
[12:33:11] <jParkton> erming you awake?
[12:33:48] <jParkton> duch and Bill are probably eating a pizza
[12:34:06] <hackal> http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/8/ here is working example but on my page this HTML is dynamically added to page after it is loaded. Looks like on('click'...) is not working on dynamcally generated data. Or is there something else I should look for?
[12:34:20] <erming> jParkton yeah, whats up?
[12:34:30] <jParkton> remember the json thingy
[12:34:48] <jParkton> I kinda solved it, and pulled the array back together https://gist.github.com/jparkton/c7e57ed6ea301858da5b
[12:34:56] <jParkton> accomplishments!
[12:34:57] <jParkton> lol
[12:35:37] <erming> great, lol :D
[12:35:47] <Tad3j> duch_kazatel, I've pasted my code here: http://pastebin.com/NmLb7XMb
[12:35:49] <Tad3j> is that ok?
[12:36:30] <jParkton> its newb and sloppy but I didnt need anyone to do it for me lol
[12:36:41] <Tad3j> or should I add the whole code?
[12:38:21] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> How do you make a character like &raquo; in js / jquery ?
[12:38:42] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> when I put a text &raquo; something in a div with jquery it doesnt translate &raquo; into the character
[12:39:21] <systemfault> ecky-ptang-zoobo: Use the actual character.
[12:39:31] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> really?
[12:39:35] <systemfault> Yeah
[12:39:43] <jParkton> \0/ jquery
[12:39:44] <systemfault> JS is not HTML.
[12:39:47] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> is that ethical?
[12:39:52] <jParkton> lol
[12:39:58] <jParkton> immoral js is immoral
[12:40:09] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> yup
[12:40:19] <systemfault> Wow, that could be the title of a book “Ethical JavaScript"
[12:40:31] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> yeah full of LIES!
[12:42:05] <systemfault> ecky-ptang-zoobo: The thing is… &raquo; is a html entity… so if you use .text().. the entity will be treated as text.
[12:42:13] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok
[12:42:20] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> if i put the actual  character it does work, thx
[12:42:21] <duch_kazatel> dammit amazon ship my headphones all ready.

[12:43:17] <Jattenalle> ooh, they look nice though
[12:43:26] <Jattenalle> just headphones, no mic?
[12:43:32] <duch_kazatel> no need for a mic at work.

[12:45:14] <duch_kazatel> ecky-ptang-zoobo not bad.
[12:45:42] <systemfault> ecky-ptang-zoobo: You use Windows… that cancels all the awesomeness.

[12:46:17] <hackal> Hello, I am having problem to remove generated data on click http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/9/ here is example. Could you please help me?
[12:46:26] <systemfault> :P
[12:46:59] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> hackal: what should be removed?
[12:47:21] <Jamal1337> duch_kazatel: thanks but there is no code to post, i try to call it with the standard command "$(".gallery").colorbox()" but nothing happens ;)
[12:48:10] <hackal> ecky-ptang-zoobo: <div class="panel panel-primary box"> so everything what was added.
[12:48:38] <duch_kazatel> Jamal1337 let me clarify the problem - we could likely help you even if we don't have experience with the plugin.  to do that, though, a working example OR some example code can help us understand what you're tyring to do and help you troubleshoot from there.
[12:48:38] <hackal> ecky-ptang-zoobo: you cant use ID as selector since it is randomly generated
[12:48:48] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> ok
[12:49:06] <Jattenalle> Jamal1337, does .gallery exist?
[12:49:11] <Jattenalle> is .colorbox() loaded
[12:49:17] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/10/
[12:49:17] <Jattenalle> etc
[12:49:20] <Jattenalle> need code
[12:49:35] <BillCriswell> http://jquerymy.com/ interesting
[12:50:05] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> hackal, try that
[12:50:16] <BillCriswell> Ah, two dependencies not just jQuery.
[12:50:33] <duch_kazatel> i was about to be very :mindblown:, BillCriswell
[12:50:59] <duch_kazatel> and with that, lunchtime.
[12:51:24] <BillCriswell> I just read "heart attack" as "horse attack" lol
[12:51:34] <hackal> ecky-ptang-zoobo: not working after you generate more then once and why is it inside button.click()?
[12:53:17] <hackal> ecky-ptang-zoobo: I will try to clean this code and will report back
[12:53:59] <Jamal1337> Jattenalle: yes and yes. I found the possibility to execute some javascript code by using "$('#timeline-embed').delegate(".vco-timeline", "LOADED", function () {" but that also does not solve the problem
[12:54:20] <Jattenalle> well good luck
[12:54:23] <Jattenalle> no code, no help...
[12:54:32] <Jattenalle> we can sit here and guess all day what you're doing and not doing..
[12:57:29] <Jamal1337> http://pastebin.com/kMfaFypx the first part is what i edited in the plugin, that it shows more than 1 image. and the second part is my own js file to call the colorbox, but nothing happens. I guess I have to find the right part in the timeline.js file itself
[12:59:11] <Jamal1337> this is the whole timeline.js file: http://pastebin.com/94mAvGSs
[13:01:56] <BillCriswell> Ugh, just spend 10 minutes trying to style a button through: a { }
[13:02:03] <BillCriswell> Fridays shouldn't be a work day.
[13:02:55] <systemfault> BillCriswell: wtf.
[13:04:25] <Jamal1337> sorry Jattenalle ..
[13:08:27] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Don't judge me.
[13:08:49] <systemfault> :(
[13:08:59] <BillCriswell> It was shorter than 10 minutes.
[13:09:11] <BillCriswell> But I think the idiocy of the mistake messed with time somehow.
[13:09:31] <decx> been there done that, only with input button while styling button
[13:09:48] <BillCriswell> decx: That's a whole lot more reasonable haha
[13:10:11] <BillCriswell> I think the reason I made this mistake is I needed to take the OUTLINE off of buttons.
[13:10:18] <BillCriswell> Only used to removing outlines from links Iguess.
[13:12:04] <hackal> Hello, I need to delete dynamically generated divs. http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/13/ here is example almost same as on my site. Could you help me fix this please?
[13:12:29] <ChrisAntaki> hackal: Have you tried $("body").empty()? That should remove the divs
[13:12:47] <BillCriswell> That'll DEFINITELY remove them.
[13:13:18] <BillCriswell> hackal: Just kidding. You should look into event delegation.
[13:13:35] <ChrisAntaki> hackal: $('.panel').remove() might also work
[13:14:20] <hackal> ChrisAntaki: yes but that would delete ALL .panel. try to hit "Add" button more then once
[13:14:30] <ChrisAntaki> oh, i see what you mean hackal
[13:14:55] <Jattenalle> the jsfiddle you linked does what you seem to be asking for
[13:14:59] <Jattenalle> what am i missing?
[13:15:27] <BillCriswell> hackal: You probably want something like $(document).on('click', '#delete', function () { });
[13:15:56] <ChrisAntaki> hackal: ID's shouldn't repeat on the same page. Try using a ".delete" class, instead of the repeated "#delete" ID
[13:16:30] <ChrisAntaki> also, the event needs to be set each time a new ".panel" is added to the page
[13:17:16] <Jattenalle> quick 'n dirty because laziness http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/14/
[13:17:20] <Jattenalle> works
[13:17:29] <Jattenalle> wait, it reset the html
[13:17:37] * Jattenalle shrugs and gets annoyed
[13:17:44] <ChrisAntaki> hackal: try this http://jsfiddle.net/bE8cW/15/
[13:18:09] <ChrisAntaki> generally, i like to create jQuery elements, add event listeners before it's in the DOM, and then insert/append it
[13:18:28] <Jattenalle> nevermind, the one i linked is fine
[13:18:39] <Jattenalle> fine as in, it works <3
[13:19:16] <ChrisAntaki> yep, yours works too Jattenalle
[13:19:53] <ChrisAntaki> hackal: now you have two paths you can take, good luck
[13:20:24] <Jattenalle> keep in mind though, that the code we both gave, is pretty horrible for any real use scenario :P
[13:20:42] <ChrisAntaki> haha
[13:20:48] <BillCriswell> I assumed there'd only be one #delete ahah
[13:21:03] <ChrisAntaki> yeah, there really should be one instance of an ID per DOM
[13:21:08] <hackal> $(document).on('click', '#delete', function () { }); this works too from: BillCriswell
[13:21:12] <Jattenalle> whenever yuo see code using #id's, always assume there's thousands of them!
[13:21:30] <BillCriswell> hackal: If there's more than one id="delete" though change id to class and use .delete.
[13:21:35] <hackal> I will change it to class
[13:21:39] <ChrisAntaki> #id's shouldn't repeat, haha
[13:21:45] <ChrisAntaki> hackal: great
[13:22:19] <hackal> Thank you very much for all your help
[13:22:34] <BillCriswell> I smell rain... why does that put me in the mood for chinese food.
[13:22:35] <ChrisAntaki> enjoy
[13:23:29] <ChrisAntaki> Chinese sounds good right now...
[13:24:05] <Shaggy158> Chinese food sounds good almost all the time ;)
[13:24:19] <ChrisAntaki> Shaggy158: Good point
[13:28:13] <nezZario> is it possible to fade and slide toggle at the same time
[13:28:21] <were_erry> can i add an event listener using jquery but.. instead of if i do .on('event') twice both things happen, i only want the last event to happen and the previous to be lost?
[13:28:37] <drej> nezZario css.
[13:28:56] <nezZario> what?
[13:29:23] <nezZario> i mean, seeing an element fade in as it is simultaneously sliding down
[13:29:32] <drej> yes, use css
[13:29:48] <nezZario> on click ??
[13:29:59] * drej sighs
[13:34:05] <nezZario> i thought jquery would use css when possible for slide and fade functions already
[13:41:58] <systemfault> nezZario: jQuery only uses functionalities that are available to all its supported browser AFAIK.
[14:02:04] <x0rs> Would anyone be able to tell me why my page (http://remedycitychurch.org/test/) cannot launch this code: (http://pastebin.com/W4vadh2h) ? It is only displaying "No events listed" rather than the events from the custom json feed. I got this from here (http://mikeclaffey.com/sandbox/gcal-embed/example-3.html), which works fine.
[14:07:56] <duch_lunch> x0rs works for me...
[14:08:45] <x0rs> duch_lunch, I actually just fixed it by recreating the source .js file to a local file on my server, though i think I will still have a problem when i change the source location to an external link such as a google calendar json feed
[14:09:05] <x0rs> duch_lunch, trying to figure out how to adjust same origin policy on server
[14:09:26] <duch_kazatel> x0rs you can't manage same-origin policy like that.
[14:09:33] <x0rs> ok
[14:09:52] <duch_kazatel> CORS is about the server you're pulling from.
[14:10:01] <duch_kazatel> you may have to proxy that connection through your box.
[14:10:19] <x0rs> hmm. interesting
[14:10:34] <x0rs> i have full control over my server.
[14:10:55] <duch_kazatel> okay - you've have to hit your server, have that fetch from google, then return that result to the page.
[14:11:07] <x0rs> duch_kazatel, thank you
[14:11:17] <duch_kazatel> x0rs of CORS
[14:11:23] <x0rs> =)
[14:11:23] <duch_kazatel> that was a terrible pun.
[14:11:27] <x0rs> rofl
[14:11:29] <x0rs> i liked it
[14:20:30] <synti> iam displaying posts from another wordpress to mine with jQuery JSON API, when the title have "" or - its showing something &#8220;TITLE&#8221; when the right title is "TITLE" can anyone help me?
[14:20:55] <duch_kazatel> synti can you share your data with us?  or a snippet?
[14:21:39] <synti> sure
[14:22:49] <synti> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/H7Pgw/
[14:24:41] <duch_kazatel> synti ah yeah because that's what the data has in it.
[14:24:54] <duch_kazatel> is it at all possible for you to correct that on the server enmd?
[14:25:19] <synti> how do u mean?
[14:25:41] <duch_kazatel> looks at the JSON - that's how the characters are represented in your data.
[14:26:34] <synti> ah i didnt check that before, sry
[14:27:10] <duch_kazatel> it looks like an encoding problem to me.
[14:27:41] <synti> it is a jetpack json api o_O
[14:28:09] <duch_kazatel> your other option is to use .html() instead of .text()
[14:29:05] <synti> oh nice it fix it
[14:30:12] <synti> i think is a Jetpack encoding problem, becouse i try it with another json api and it works good
[14:30:23] <synti> with .html it works to, thank you
[14:30:30] <duch_kazatel> yeah looks like an encoding thing.

[14:59:43] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam look at the source and go to town?

[15:00:41] <duch_kazatel> your network tab.
[15:00:44] <sunbeam> ok

[15:01:01] <sunbeam> Firebug -> Net - right?
[15:01:16] <duch_kazatel> that's one way, yes.
[15:03:26] <sunbeam> Is there a better way?
[15:03:47] <duch_kazatel> you might not have rights to download the font, soooo....
[15:03:54] <duch_kazatel> you wanting to do this is kind of sketch.

[15:11:27] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: you see which font it is ?
[15:11:47] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam i'm not looking for you.
[15:11:50] <duch_kazatel> because you PMed me ;)
[15:11:52] <sil3nti> duch_kazatel: no but i mean the script where i have the hide function is in the same server with iframe
[15:12:01] <sunbeam> oh great :P
[15:12:11] <duch_kazatel> sil3nti that doesn't matter - it's the site youre displaying on.
[15:12:21] <duch_kazatel> *you're
[15:12:33] <sil3nti> yes the site iam displaying on is the same with the iframe link
[15:13:06] <duch_kazatel> then i dunno.
[15:13:22] <duch_kazatel> your if statement is broken or you're breaking cross-domain.
[15:13:53] <sil3nti> iam displaying iframe on oranews.tv and the iframe is in oranews.tv/breaking.php
[15:14:13] <sil3nti> is the same domain same server
[15:14:48] <duch_kazatel> this seems like a lot of effot when you should just use a json feed.
[15:15:53] <sil3nti> iam catching the text directly from database becouse is a local mysql server
[15:16:15] <duch_kazatel> aaand again - this seems like a lot of effort when you should just use a JSON feed.
[15:16:27] <sil3nti> haha i dont know how to make it :P
[15:16:33] <duch_kazatel> then read about it.
[15:16:43] <duch_kazatel> because what you're doing isn't going to be sustainable.
[15:17:31] <duch_kazatel> do a console.log() of what you're trying to select.
[15:18:31] <Zzaichik> Damn, Gina
[15:18:50] <sil3nti> duch_kazatel: how can i display data from mysql? with json_encoding?
[15:19:12] <duch_kazatel> dunno your platform/framework/etc.  i'd google it.
[15:19:56] <sil3nti> windows server and uWamp
[15:20:06] <duch_kazatel> go google it.
[15:20:13] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to walk you through the process ;)
[15:21:24] <duch_kazatel> also: do NOT use that setup for your production server.
[15:22:17] <sil3nti> duch_kazatel: wich setup?
[15:22:21] <sil3nti> uWamp?
[15:22:22] <duch_kazatel> yes
[15:22:39] <sil3nti> why? is that not good?
[15:22:48] <duch_kazatel> it's meant for development, not for production
[15:23:06] <duch_kazatel> it's open to simple attacks, insecure, etc.
[15:23:25] <sil3nti> is wamp better that uwamp ?
[15:23:32] <duch_kazatel> same thing duder
[15:23:47] <duch_kazatel> those are all intended for development, not production.
[15:24:01] <duch_kazatel> uwamp IS wamp but you don't install it, looks like.
[15:31:58] <Tad3j> I think u stands for micro version
[15:32:15] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:32:40] <duch_kazatel> oh i see what you're saying.
[15:32:50] <duch_kazatel> shouldn't be run for a live server, either way.
[15:33:10] <Tad3j> I agree :)
[15:37:53] <narkeeso> Is there a way to force $.ajax() to run success/done callback on a specified error status code?
[15:38:31] <duch_kazatel> err, there may be, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the done callback.
[15:38:51] <duch_kazatel> why not use .then()?
[15:39:20] <narkeeso> Does then() defer success/error?
[15:39:43] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[15:40:06] <duch_kazatel> you can set for both.
[15:40:31] <duch_kazatel> but having the same logic for both is kind of strange - you might be better served splitting your logic up a little.
[15:41:41] <narkeeso> duch_kazatel: perfect! thanks i think this will do what I need
[15:41:42] <sil3nti> duch_kazatel: http://www.oranews.tv/breaking.php love google :P
[15:41:57] <duch_kazatel> make that .json instead of .php
[15:42:02] <duch_kazatel> and you'll be good to go.
[15:42:14] <sil3nti> thanks :)
[15:43:19] <sil3nti> it showing the all code when i make .json
[15:43:41] <duch_kazatel> you need to modify your backend so you can request that with .json
[15:44:05] <sil3nti> can i use it with .php ? or its wrong?
[15:44:38] <duch_kazatel> it's a JSON file you're requesting.  makes more sense in the long run.
[15:44:46] <duch_kazatel> same thing with not using what you're using for production.
[16:56:40] <sil3nti> duch_kazatel: do u still there?
[17:05:21] <duch_kazatel> hella i do.
[17:21:56] <querylous> I'm a noob and I'm having trouble - I have a login box, and I want to fade everything but that box when it's activated. Easy way to select all elements that aren't #login-box?
[17:23:10] <querylous> tried $("*:not(#login-box)").fadeTo( "slow", .25) or something, but it did everything.
[17:23:28] <querylous> I've heard that * is not a good idea
[17:23:32] <duch_kazatel> because that's fading the parent, too.
[17:26:24] <querylous> okay, whY?
[17:28:17] <duch_kazatel> because you're selecting parent elements ;)
[17:28:30] <duch_kazatel> look into modals - that'll give you what you want.
[17:28:40] <querylous> That would be why using * is recommended against, I'm guessing?
[17:29:38] <joshsmith> I think I am misunderstanding how mockjax is supposed to work http://jsbin.com/netopini/1/
[17:30:35] <querylous> @duch_kazafel, thanks. that's perfect. I guess I probably should have assumed jquery had a method for something so common.
[17:31:38] <joshsmith> I would’ve thought that would return some data
[17:32:59] <joshsmith> rather http://jsbin.com/netopini/1/edit?html,js,console
[17:35:39] <redShadow> hi guys! ..can anybody come up with a better solution than this http://jsfiddle.net/fjAE6/7/ for making a UI droppable decide whether to accept a UI draggable or not?
[17:36:30] <redShadow> I don't really like that way of changing the default option on the draggable.. All the droppables have to remember to set it or face unexpected behavior
[18:00:28] <jaspertheghost> k
[18:01:45] <litropy> I'm using jquery mobile. When I <a href="myfolder/mypage.html">My Link</a>, jquery redundantly lists the folder of the path: myfolder/myfolder/mypage.html
[18:01:53] <jaspertheghost> hello in the following example http://pastebin.com/gdCfBUQT  how do we know we can use 2 variables in function()    i,v  and how do we know what i and v represent?
[18:02:59] <litropy> copying the link URL returns the absolute path, refundancy included. Yet viewing the source of my html file shows no such redundancy.
[18:04:10] <litropy> Even renaming the folder and clearing browser data still results in folder redundancy of the path.
[18:06:16] <jaspertheghost> nvm to my question read the manual got it :)
[19:00:35] <jaspertheghost> hello
[19:00:45] <jaspertheghost> how can i get the same effect as this (its not working) var params = $("#form1").hasClass("test").serialize();
[19:16:20] <enape_101>  hey, looking for great frontend designers that have experience with Rails for a paid opportunity. email pblogsltd@gmail.com and i'll provide more details, thanks
[19:31:44] <aro> is there a way to turn $(form).serialize(); into an object?
[19:31:46] <aro> instead of a string
[19:34:39] <jonclark> aro: maybe this? https://github.com/chrissrogers/jquery-deparam
[19:35:19] <systemfault> aro: Perhaps .serializeArray() would be enough for you
[19:36:05] <jonclark> ^ use that instead :)
[19:36:16] <Velveeta> (y)
[19:45:42] <Mael> well hello there
[19:45:51] <Velveeta> allo guv'na
[19:46:06] <Mael> This the place to ask questions about coding stuffs? =D
[19:46:12] <Mael> short questions quick answers
[19:46:19] <Velveeta> yep, so long as they're jquery-related
[19:46:32] <Mael> well, jquery/ajax related
[19:46:45] <Velveeta> yepyep, go for it
[19:47:15] <Mael> i'm just starting on ajax today after working with jquery over the last 4 months
[19:47:25] <Mael> i'm already highly fluent in php/mysql
[19:47:45] <Mael> i notice that ajax is used a lot to query from xml files and what not
[19:47:52] <Velveeta> i remember when i used to be highly fluent in those.. my php/mysql skills have somewhat rotted over the last 3 years
[19:48:09] <Mael> haha yeah i'm still building on mine but i got pretty good really fast, i had a great professor at school
[19:48:10] <Velveeta> well, you don't typically query from xml files, but you query some back end service that may in turn query xml
[19:48:34] <Velveeta> yeah, php/mysql is great for jumping right in and getting your feet wet, low barrier to entry, that's where i got my start in web dev
[19:48:41] <Mael> nice
[19:49:05] <Mael> well the reason i picked up javascript and jquery was so that i can make my way to ajax to query my databases
[19:49:40] <aro> serializearray?
[19:49:44] <aro> doesnt that create ana rray?
[19:49:58] <Velveeta> so ajax is a lot more simple than i think you may be thinking it is.. you won't be querying your db's directly from javascript, unless you're querying a nodejs back end
[19:50:18] <Velveeta> but typically, you'll set up an ajax request to your php endpoint, which will in turn query your db, and hand the results back to javascript
[19:50:20] <Mael> if things are making sense the way i suspect, should i just be able to insert jquery/ajax into my php files to load info from the database without having to refresh my pages?
[19:50:52] <Velveeta> so what you would do would be something like this: <let me throw together a quick gist>
[19:51:46] <aro> i need it to be a javascript object
[19:52:23] <Mael> so say i have a mysqli query written in php
[19:52:38] <Mael> can i insert that entire thing into a jquery function?
[19:53:07] <Mael> and it will work without refreshing the page?
[19:54:39] <Velveeta> ok mael, yere you go: https://gist.github.com/Velveeta/c406cb10f4e4fbb21ab3
[19:54:56] <Velveeta> you leave your mysqli query in php, and you call back to that php script via your ajax request
[19:55:14] <Velveeta> php does the legwork of communicating w/ the db, harvests the results, and hands them back to javascript
[19:55:21] <Mael> yes
[19:55:22] <aro> jonclark
[19:55:29] <aro> does deparam only work on query strings?
[19:55:48] <Velveeta> aro: only on query-string-formatted strings, yes, key/value pairs, like foo=bar&this=that
[19:55:52] <jonclark> mm I think so, but when you use serialize() that's the kind of string you're getting
[19:55:58] <aro> ok
[19:56:07] <aro> i need to take the output from serialize() and objectify it
[19:56:36] <Mael> and so the results from the query will be spit back out in json format?
[19:56:36] <Velveeta> right, serialize will harvest the form elements, convert it to a key/value pair string, and then deparam will deserialize that into an object
[19:56:53] <Velveeta> mael: yes, php will spit them out in json format, and javascript will reconsume that as a js object
[19:57:15] <aro> ok
[19:58:15] <Mael> and then i can use jquery to take the results from that data and put them into jquery variables, manipulate them, then use ajax to put them back into the db through another mysqli_query
[19:58:59] <Velveeta> right, you would manipulate whatever you're gonna work with, then make another ajax request to a php script on the back end, which would receive that data through something like $_GET or $_POST, throw that into a query, and pass it back to the db through mysqli_query
[19:59:20] <Mael> wonderful
[19:59:25] <Velveeta> and then probably respond to javascript with some object like: { success: true } or { success: false, error: 'Something happened' }
[19:59:33] <Velveeta> and that way, js can report feedback to the user about the outcome
[19:59:52] <Mael> even though i haven't figured out on my own how to do this
[20:00:00] <Mael> it's kind of a relief
[20:00:08] <Mael> i thought iw as going to have to overhaul 5000 lines of php code lol
[20:00:52] <Velveeta> nope, however, with those kinds of concerns, i would definitely recommend learning a php framework to help with code organization, if you haven't already
[20:01:08] <tw2113> sup cheese
[20:01:11] <Velveeta> i'm not a big fan of zend, but it's a popular one.. cake isn't too bad, and i like cough, but it's a little known one, and not maintained anymore
[20:01:14] <Velveeta> nada tw
[20:01:16] <Mael> i'm not too familiar with php frameworks
[20:01:20] <Velveeta> watching grudge match
[20:01:48] <Velveeta> mael: frameworks are designed as a means to an end, that end being to abstract away a lot of boilerplate code and help better organize your own business logic
[20:02:17] <Velveeta> a lot of typical operations like setting up connections to db's, or client requests, dispatching to various code modules, etc, frameworks make nice and easy
[20:02:31] <Mael> well
[20:02:35] <Velveeta> javascript itself is in a state of rapid maturation as far as framework offerings are concerned also
[20:02:44] <Velveeta> not a week goes by that i don't learn about yet another one
[20:02:46] <Mael> like i said i had an awesome professor for php, i have a file called mysqli_connect.php
[20:02:58] <Mael> and i use the require_once php function to call it at the top of my pages
[20:03:11] <Mael> that has all my db info in it, so i don't call my db info multiple times, just once per page
[20:03:16] <Mael> and i close the connection at the bottom of each page
[20:03:17] <Velveeta> right
[20:05:11] <Mael> wordpress is considered a framework right?
[20:05:19] <tw2113> no
[20:05:22] <Mael> teehee
[20:05:31] <tw2113> some still don't call it a CMS
[20:05:41] <Mael> oh right, i knew it was a cms lewl
[20:06:08] <wormmd> Am I reading the $.ajax docs right? Can I bypass CORS if I just set crossDomain to true? I'm still googling, but I swear...
[20:06:39] <Velveeta> wormmd: i think the crossdomain setting just sets it up as a jsonp request, but i'm not positive about that
[20:07:12] <Velveeta> mael: yeah wordpress is a cms.. it does have a prescribed format for things like plugins, but it's not a framework itself
[20:07:27] <Velveeta> a php framework would be like cakephp.. a javascript framework would be like backbone or angular or riot
[20:07:36] <tw2113> i'm a part of something that's helping treat it as an native app content provider
[20:07:45] <tw2113> wordpress that is
[20:07:47] <Mael> i'd probably just have to get one to really understand what they do
[20:07:52] <Velveeta> right
[20:08:04] <Velveeta> another of the more popular ones is symfony, but i've never used that one myself
[20:08:22] <tw2113> laravel is popular these days
[20:08:40] <jonclark> laravel is sewww hot right now
[20:08:56] <jonclark> made by the old cakephp people, really stripped down
[20:09:07] <jonclark> i have never used it though, just seen the source :)
[20:09:08] <Velveeta> nice
[20:09:15] <Velveeta> yeah i haven't even touched php in close to 3 years
[20:09:30] <tw2113> what gets me is that laravel apparently "needs" to be in the root directory of your domain to work properly
[20:09:45] <tw2113> i was trying to run it in a subdir and was having issues
[20:09:53] <tw2113> it was suggested to me to move it to a subdomain
[20:09:58] <Velveeta> htaccess?
[20:10:06] <Velveeta> i don't know if a rewrite would help at all
[20:10:12] <tw2113> that was part of some of the issues
[20:10:20] <tw2113> it was just odd
[20:11:23] <Mael> I'm glad i found this place! I use stackoverflow.com and found a topic talking about freenode.net
[20:11:42] <Mael> i'll be back for sure with more questions haha. Thanks for the help Velveeta you're awesome!
[20:11:44] <tw2113> unbeknownst to most, IRC is still around and quite active
[20:11:52] <Mael> I've used irc for so effing long
[20:11:55] <Mael> since i was like 14
[20:12:00] <Mael> and uuh that was 14 years ago
[20:12:00] <Mael> lol
[20:12:02] <tw2113> so a year? *runs*
[20:12:04] <tw2113> ah,
[20:12:08] <Mael> i'm 28
[20:12:12] <Velveeta> mael: no problemo, that's what we're here for :)
[20:12:18] <tw2113> remember Mael
[20:12:23] <tw2113> ask for the cheese when you return
[20:12:32] <Velveeta> yeah, i've been pretty surprised at how active irc still is
[20:12:39] <Mael> haha yeah
[20:12:47] <Mael> i started using it after Mplayer died
[20:12:52] <Mael> if anyone remembers that program
[20:12:53] <Velveeta> the other day, i jumped on here to hit up #requirejs with a question, and just tried the channel name out of the blue, unsure if it even existed... around 50 users or so
[20:12:59] <tw2113> mplayer is dead?
[20:13:04] <Velveeta> the guy answering my question was actually the author of the plugin i was trying to migrate away from :D
[20:13:10] <Mael> well, before they rebooted it, the original mplayer
[20:13:37] <Mael> i used it to play quake 1
[20:13:48] <Mael> when found a community on irc that played quake 1
[20:13:52] <Mael> this was in like 1997 Lol
[20:14:02] <Mael> then*
[20:14:10] <Velveeta> quake is probably still my favorite of the old first person shooters
[20:14:24] <Velveeta> actually, probably halflife counterstrike, and *then* quake :D
[20:14:30] <Velveeta> and then unreal tournament
[20:14:41] <Mael> yeah i did quake one for the better part of a decade
[20:15:02] <Mael> i did alot of wolfenstein enemy territory, and unreal tournament 2k4
[20:15:44] <Velveeta> i saw a decent first person engine the other day, written in 256 lines of javascript :D
[20:15:55] <Mael> lolz
[20:16:22] <Velveeta> whoops, 265 lines
[20:16:24] <Velveeta> http://www.playfuljs.com/a-first-person-engine-in-265-lines/?utm_source=javascriptweekly&utm_medium=email
[20:16:46] <Velveeta> that's at least on par with traditional wolfenstein graphics
[20:16:59] <Mael> crazy! yeah
[20:17:35] <Velveeta> yeah, it's pretty crazy the way the language is maturing these days... let me show you this, for future career consideration ;) ....... <fetching link>
[20:18:01] <Velveeta> http://ericleads.com/2010/10/javascript-revolution/
[20:18:29] <Velveeta> especially with emerging ES6 standards
[20:18:45] <Velveeta> harmony modules, generator functions, all sorts of niceties :)
[20:22:12] <Mael> jquery can be used to do all of this right?
[20:22:35] <systemfault> Mael: jQuery is just a DOM abstraction layer.
[20:23:06] <Velveeta> right, jquery is just 1 set of tools.. its primary use is for simplifying dom manipulation and ajax functionality
[20:23:16] <Mael> nice
[20:23:39] <Velveeta> a lot of people have started using it more recently for promise functionality also, but there are better promise libraries out there
[20:23:41] <Mael> yeah that's pretty much what i need for right now
[20:23:57] <Velveeta> but the ES6 stuff is not covered by jquery
[20:24:12] <Mael> yah i'm def not trying to create a fps environment haha
[20:24:17] <Mael> but it's all very fascinating
[20:24:33] <Velveeta> well yeah, that FPS is non-ES6 stuff, that's just vanilla javascript ;)
[20:25:08] <Mael> haha
[20:25:56] <Mael> alright well it's been a pleasure chatting, dinner and a movie time for me
[20:26:03] <Mael> can only learn so much in a day haha. laters!
[20:26:11] <Velveeta> rightio
[20:26:17] <Velveeta> here, let me fetch you one more link
[20:26:26] <Velveeta> although, this is for a life of javascript work:
[20:26:28] <jonclark> good luck! jquery enlightenment by cody lindley is a great start.. ebook
[20:26:33] <Velveeta> http://javascriptweekly.com/
[20:26:59] <Velveeta> they harvest the best articles and new emerging js frameworks/libraries/technologies per week, and send out a weekly digest
[20:27:13] <Velveeta> it's a great way to stay on top of emerging trends without having to spend all your time scouring the internet for it
[20:27:20] <Velveeta> there's probably something similar for php
[20:27:28] <Mael> nice, yeah i'll have to look into that
[20:27:34] <Velveeta> whaddya know: http://www.phpweekly.com/
[20:27:38] <Mael> lol
[20:27:56] <Velveeta> knowledge is power, and the internet's full of it
[20:28:32] <Mael> couldn't agree more! alright im off, thanks again!
[20:28:48] <tw2113> if you can see through all the cats
[20:29:53] <tw2113> there be knowledge in these tubes, if you can get by the cat hair clogs
[20:30:41] <Velveeta> sometimes my tubes get clogged, and i have to call time warner
[20:33:15] <tw2113> ya know what i'm doing for fun on a friday night Velveeta ?
[20:36:08] <Velveeta> working?
[20:36:28] <tw2113> yes, that's definitely part of it
[20:36:33] <Velveeta> i'm drinking and watching 'grudge match', and thinking about how i should be working but that it's enough of a mess that in my current state of mind, it would be more pain than pleasure
[20:36:53] <tw2113> but the detail: ssh'ing into a live site, compressing the uploads directory for the WP install on it, and then downloading locally
[20:37:04] <tw2113> 3.98gb zip file
[20:38:11] <Velveeta> jesus, wtf
[20:38:37] <Velveeta> i'm still in the middle of a full-suite-of-products-upgrade-of-my-own-product-within-their-products project
[20:38:51] <Velveeta> we're on the 2nd to last product, and then i get to work on my own product again
[20:38:52] <tw2113> it's for a WordPress Multisite install
[20:38:59] <tw2113> so essentially 12 sites on one domain
[20:39:14] <Velveeta> also, i'm considering submitting for another conference presentation, but right now the topic is still vaporware
[20:39:26] <Velveeta> so i would have to use the next 3 months to get a proof of concept working and have something to present
[20:39:32] <Velveeta> if they actually selected me
[20:40:29] <tw2113> yeah, i haven't bothered to try speaking anywhere yet
[20:42:40] <Velveeta> i've only done it once... i was a sweaty mess at the end of it, but it was a good experience, and i totally want to do it some more
[20:42:50] <Velveeta> part of the whole sweaty mess was that fucking spotlight they have in your eyes
[20:43:54] <Velveeta> but i got to meet alex sexton, that was cool
[20:44:03] <Velveeta> and i saw rebecca murphey, but never said hi
[20:44:15] <Velveeta> no paul irish and no addy osmani, or i might have fainted from hero worship
[20:44:35] <tw2113> paul has that effect i've heard
[20:44:43] <Velveeta> his brain is pretty dreamy
[20:48:46] <antlong_> i want to vomit.
[20:49:13] <tw2113> aim for the trash can
[20:49:38] <antlong_> have you spent 14 hours on a bug, and gotten aboslutely no where
[20:49:52] <arschmitz> antlong_: on a bug you say?
[20:49:59] <antlong_> yes sir.
[20:50:21] <antlong_> bonus points if it's a really stupid obscure one.
[20:51:24] <arschmitz> antlong_: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwvhfu0Oqh1qggdq1.jpg
[20:51:47] <antlong_> :)
[20:51:54] <arschmitz> going no where
[20:53:32] <antlong_> im at the point where im going to start propositioning people
[21:26:05] <Velveeta> antlong_: I spend almost 2 full days trying to solve a single issue in a requirejs config
[21:26:18] <antlong_> Velveeta yeah?
[21:26:31] <Velveeta> yep, and the solution i wound up with was ugly as hell
[21:26:36] <Velveeta> .......but it works
[21:26:48] <antlong_> thats all that matters
[21:26:52] <antlong_> atleast you have a solution
[21:27:48] <systemfault> Velveeta: Yeah… had similar issues with requirejs, but no more… I’m using browserify now.
[21:28:18] <Velveeta> systemfault: i haven't dabbled in browserify yet, but this was for another of our products, so i have to work with their existing tech stack
[22:18:05] <jaspertheghost> hello anyone can point me in the right direction for detectig internet connection reliably in jquery or JS
[22:22:28] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost depends - why?
[22:23:37] <jaspertheghost> i think this is my best bet
[22:23:38] <jaspertheghost> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3543683/determine-if-ajax-error-is-a-timeout
[22:24:01] <duch_kazatel> why do you need to detect the connect?
[22:24:04] <duch_kazatel> *connection
[22:24:33] <jaspertheghost> so that my android app will start pulling data from sqlite database (running this in a webview with JSinterface to java)
[22:24:48] <duch_kazatel> aaah so the js is all ready downloaded.  yeah use $.ajax()
[22:25:11] <Velveeta> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9526647/check-if-connected-to-a-network-jquery
[22:25:37] <duch_kazatel> hah even better.
[22:25:45] <jaspertheghost> navigator.online = doesnt work
[22:25:54] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[22:25:54] <jaspertheghost> the ajax request is teh best
[22:26:09] <jaspertheghost> only works in chrome and other webkit browsers (webview on andriod always returns true)
[22:26:29] <duch_kazatel> you said it's a webview in your app....
[22:26:39] <jaspertheghost> yes but it doest work either for some reason*
[22:26:43] <Velveeta> this is a native app?
[22:26:43] <jaspertheghost> its a known issue
[22:26:49] <jaspertheghost> yes
[22:26:58] <duch_kazatel> apparently linux always retrns true
[22:27:08] <Velveeta> why not just write a web app and deploy it with phonegap or something?
[22:27:28] <jaspertheghost> its half webapp half regular code the app im making
[22:27:39] <Velveeta> if you're writing a native app, shouldn't there be something in the android api that should give you network status?
[22:27:44] <jaspertheghost> i wanted to learn regular andorid programming, a bit before doing phonegap
[22:27:55] <jaspertheghost> yes i already wrote that part
[22:28:01] <jaspertheghost> i need to detect it in the webview part too
[22:28:09] <Velveeta> i find native programming, in either android or ios, fruitless in the face of hybrid wrappers
[22:28:17] <Velveeta> i'm all about the write once deploy many philosophy
[22:28:43] <jaspertheghost> yea phonegap is my next step but i need background service features and the like, GPS functionality etc...
[22:28:57] <jaspertheghost> so ineeded to make sure before i started writing i could do everything i wanted and this was the sure fire way
[22:29:03] <Velveeta> phonegap provides api entry points for things like gps, etc
[22:29:20] <Velveeta> accelerometer, contacts, all sorts of native phone api's
[22:29:29] <jaspertheghost> oh yea i know but background services …
[22:29:35] <Velveeta> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/cordova_geolocation_geolocation.md.html
[22:29:36] <jaspertheghost> its start to get harry
[22:29:43] <jaspertheghost> i know all this i did my research
[22:29:55] <Velveeta> alrighty then
[22:33:29] <jaspertheghost> question when doing .getJSON ….. .fail(function(data) {    .fail actually passes 3 params how does receviing just one with “data” work  *
[22:33:49] <duch_kazatel> just pass the one arg...
[22:33:59] <jaspertheghost> the first one the last one?
[22:34:26] <duch_kazatel> the first arg is the data...
[22:34:44] <duch_kazatel> if you pass just one arg, you get just the data.  the other two aren't passed.
[22:35:10] <Velveeta> the data doesn't actually get passed to the xhr promise fail callback
[22:35:17] <duch_kazatel> that's true.
[22:35:26] <Velveeta> it receives ( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown ) according to the docs
[22:35:45] <duch_kazatel> that's right, fail is different.
[22:35:50] <duch_kazatel> derp derp
[22:39:34] <jaspertheghost> ok next question looks like .getjson doesnt support a timeout
[22:39:37] <jaspertheghost> is this correct
[22:39:52] <Velveeta> i don't think so, but getjson is just syntactical sugar on top of $.ajax
[22:40:13] <Velveeta> you can duplicate the same thing w/ $.ajax, and add your own timeout
[22:41:31] <jaspertheghost> ajaxSetup  will let me globally set the timeout for jquery though right?
[22:42:00] <Velveeta> quite possibly, i've never tested that with any of the other extension functions like $.post, $.getJSON, etc
[22:42:01] <jaspertheghost> cause with the code im working on it failing the .getjson call im doing .. if it fails no matter what ill just set the webview to offline mode and continue going...
[22:42:30] <jaspertheghost> instead of wrigting directly with .ajax
[22:49:31] <Kitu> hi
[22:49:37] <jaspertheghost> hi
[22:50:21] <Kitu> http://bpaste.net/show/L6UeWQN1zX50r3FfpjYJ/
[22:50:48] <Kitu> it don't want convert the $filtered object in string
[22:50:57] <Kitu> how to do ?
[22:52:00] <jaspertheghost> could you explain your code a bit more… im not a jquery expert at all but i may be able to help
[22:52:14] <Kitu> ok
[22:53:28] <Kitu> the function return the text nodes and the img class="emoticon" only in the msg string
[22:54:02] <Kitu> and I want truncate this message
[22:54:29] <Kitu> but $filtered is an object, so the substr don't work
[22:54:41] <fuse405> can someone have a look at http://scsys.co.uk:8002/394504
[22:56:56] <Kitu> it's an object*
[22:57:26] <jaspertheghost> ok one sec
[22:59:36] <jaspertheghost> try ,text or .val instead og html
[22:59:54] <jaspertheghost> i wish u could paste the console.log of the object
[23:00:02] <jaspertheghost> or json encode the object and send the object for me to take a look at
[23:04:54] <jaspertheghost> JSON.stringify the object and apply the text to a input box
[23:05:00] <jaspertheghost> and copy and paste it to me that wayt i can rebuild it
[23:05:32] <jaspertheghost> im a visual person some people can do it without seeing anything idk how they do it but i need to see the object
[23:06:58] <Kitu> ok
[23:07:01] <Kitu> 3 seconds
[23:07:33] <jaspertheghost> and jsfiddle is good for stuff like this too btw that way we can play with working code
[23:08:04] <Kitu> it don't want JSON.stringify ...
[23:08:21] <Kitu> http://jsfiddle.net/yQSSb/
[23:09:09] <jaspertheghost> "{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"length":3,"prevObject":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"3":{},"4":{},"length":5,"prevObject":{"0":{},"1":{},"length":2,"prevObject":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"length":3,"prevObject":{"0":{},"1":{},"2":{},"length":3,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1,"prevObject":{"0":{},"length":1}},"selector":"*"}}}}}"
[23:09:14] <jaspertheghost> thats the json object
[23:10:13] <Kitu> how do you obtain this ?
[23:10:25] <jaspertheghost> it was in my console when i ran your code
[23:10:38] <Kitu> on the jsfiddle ?
[23:10:39] <jaspertheghost> JSON.stringify returned it
[23:10:40] <jaspertheghost> yea
[23:10:47] <Kitu> I have an error me
[23:11:02] <jaspertheghost> what browser u using
[23:11:09] <Kitu> google chrome
[23:13:06] <Kitu> ok it's work firefox
[23:13:12] <Kitu> with firefox
[23:13:33] <Kitu> but
[23:13:43] <Kitu> where is the datas in this json ?
[23:17:59] <jaspertheghost> i think i got this for ya
[23:18:00] <jaspertheghost> hold on
[23:18:28] <jaspertheghost> 	var html = $("<div />").append($(filtered).clone()).html();
[23:18:29] <jaspertheghost>     console.log(html)
[23:18:37] <jaspertheghost> return html;
[23:20:34] <Kitu> ah yes
[23:21:00] <jaspertheghost> is that what u neeed?
[23:22:48] <Kitu> yes
[23:22:52] <Kitu> thanks
[23:24:24] <jaspertheghost> no prob that was a learning exercise for me too lol

[23:34:47] <jaspertheghost> hi
[23:35:23] <vicky> i got a doubt using .near() in jquery
[23:35:32] <jaspertheghost> btw fuse … looks like jquery script isnt being initilized
[23:35:35] <vicky> .next()
[23:35:38] <vicky> typo
[23:35:47] <jaspertheghost> ok whats up?
[23:36:13] <vicky> <section>     first     <input type="button" id="button"/> </section> <h1>helo</h1> <section class="moo">     last </section>
[23:36:19] <vicky> thats my html
[23:36:29] <vicky> $("#button").click(function(){ $(this).parent('section').next('section').html("sucess"); });
[23:36:48] <vicky> .next('section') doesn't work for me
[23:37:28] <vicky> any clue?
[23:39:01] <vicky> http://jsfiddle.net/p3sFh/44/
[23:39:13] <vicky> can u have a look at the above link
[23:39:53] <jaspertheghost> let me look at the documentation one sec
[23:39:54] <vicky> anybody ter?
[23:40:00] <vicky> yep sure
[23:40:19] <disappearedng> hey so when my users click on a calendar event on my calendar, I would like to allow my user to either 1. Change the date, or 2. Set completed by another user. I don't want the user to be able to change both. What's a good UX experience to present a list of optiions to my user and only allow them to pick one?
[23:40:42] <jaspertheghost> hows this-> http://jsfiddle.net/p3sFh/45/
[23:40:43] <jaspertheghost> or no?
[23:41:12] <jaspertheghost> or u need the next section
[23:41:19] <vicky> yes
[23:41:23] <vicky> i need next section
[23:41:56] <vicky> i wanna access .next() on tag name 'section'
[23:46:01] <jaspertheghost> u dont wanna ust use the class name>
[23:46:10] <vicky> nope
[23:46:24] <vicky> i want it through the tag name
[23:50:40] <jaspertheghost> ok well none of these are siblings
[23:50:41] <antlong_> how would i implement a rate limit on a key binding? i want it to fire repeatedly when held, but limit it.
[23:53:58] <vicky> @jasper ?
[23:54:48] <vicky> u mean its not possible to do like that
[23:54:49] <vicky> ?
[23:55:20] <vicky> any solution?
[23:56:35] <jaspertheghost> trying ..
[23:59:17] <jaspertheghost>     $("section:nth-last-of-type(1)").html("sdfdsf");
