[00:01:07] <spronk> riight i see
[00:01:11] <spronk> i  think
[00:01:54] <spronk> so i just need a constant element above my #+listenId to bind the delegate to?
[00:02:10] <spronk> and future events will bubble up to there instead of being bound directly to the inner stuff
[00:02:27] <Cork> if you want the exact same behavior as .live do $(document).delegate('selector', 'click')
[00:02:48] <Cork> but ya, normally it's nicer to have a static parent to bind on
[00:03:04] <spronk> indeed.
[00:03:08] <spronk> now to find said static parent :P
[00:03:10] <spronk> thanks :)
[00:03:20] <Cork> :)
[00:07:38] <spronk> here's another stupid question - if I bind the change event, what event do i need to bind to trigger (id).change() on whenever the parent element has new content loaded?
[00:08:00] <Cork> you can't do that
[00:08:16] <lemonsparrow> when I try this answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6364748/change-the-options-array-of-a-select-list#answer-6364838 I get error SyntaxError: unterminated string literal [Break On This Error] 	  .inject($('testing
[00:08:24] <Cork> there isn't any event for dom modifications (that is supported in all browsers that is)
[00:08:28] <spronk> i see
[00:11:00] <spronk> cms i'm using (silverstripe) loads all internal forms via ajax,so my bindings work OK, but triggering the initial state on ajax load is tricky
[00:13:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any idea ? ^^
[00:21:05] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:24:54] <xertion> Cork: Regarding the delegate() that you adviced me about earlier. I call it as "$('#canvas').delegate('.textarea', 'click', clickText);". In clickText I then save the location as var location = $(this).
[00:25:10] <xertion> later when I use location.addClass(); it adds the class to ALL elements with .textarea.
[00:25:21] <Lucaszz> Hi
[00:25:28] <xertion> When I use delegate, do $(this) work different? Does it automatically select all elements with that class?
[00:25:55] <Cork> xertion: this has never selected ALL elements
[00:25:56] <Cork> ever
[00:25:57] <Lucaszz> How to parse javascript array []  to JSON {}  ?
[00:26:15] <Cork> it returns the element the event happened on
[00:26:23] <Cork> Lucaszz: what?
[00:26:34] <Cork> why would you parse an array to an object?
[00:26:59] <Lucaszz> Cork: How to convert array to json
[00:27:00] <Lucaszz> ?
[00:27:16] <Cork> ?eval JSON.stringify([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
[00:27:21] <bot-t> Cork: "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]"
[00:29:47] <xertion> Cork: http://pastebin.com/X4GtCivr There you can see me using delegate. I have multiple div's with ".textarea". When input.keyup() is called, the input.val() is applied to all elements with .textarea.
[00:29:55] <xertion> Would appreciate if you could take a look.
[00:30:57] <Cork> xertion: ya, that should work; btw i would recommend not using the variable name location
[00:31:29] <Cork> cause you have the default variable window.location it could be confusing
[00:32:20] <xecycle> Hello.  Is there an equivalent of .html() for XML documents?
[00:32:27] <Cork> .html()
[00:32:55] <Cork> xecycle: browser only have text and dom
[00:33:02] <xecycle> Cork: Sadly the documentation told me this is not available for XML documents :(  And I failed it in chrome.
[00:33:05] <Cork> it doens't special case html vs xml
[00:33:27] <Cork> xecycle: sounds like you're working with a none jquery object
[00:33:35] <Cork> try $(variable).html()
[00:33:47] <xecycle> Well.  In FF .html() did return the inner tree for me; but it failed in chrome.  Yes I already did $(foo).html().
[00:34:05] <xec_> what an annoying nick ;)
[00:34:12] <Cork> :)
[00:34:17] <xecycle> :/
[00:34:18] <Cork> highlights huh?
[00:34:21] <xec_> ye
[00:34:25] <Cork> :D
[00:34:58] <Cork> xecycle: and you're sure you've gotten a dom element in the variable?
[00:35:19] <Cork> (have to admit, i haven't used xml in the web for ages)
[00:35:21] <xecycle> Cork: I think so.  The console reported a value for it.
[00:35:38] <Cork> and node.innerHTML is undefined?
[00:35:53] <xecycle> Cork: Yes, undefined.
[00:36:27] <xec_> "The .html() method is not available in XML documents" according to http://api.jquery.com/html/
[00:36:37] <xecycle> It was a separate XML document retrieved by ajax.
[00:36:53] <xecycle> xec_: Yes I saw that sentence.
[00:36:57] <Cork> sounds like you've got your self a pure node tree instead of a dom tree
[00:37:22] <xecycle> Cork: Yup, it was not valid HTML; but an XML.
[00:37:40] <Cork> xecycle: witch means you would have to take the node, clone it create a new document
[00:37:58] <Cork> append the new node to the document, and then serialize the document
[00:38:17] <Cork> that should work even on a pure node tree
[00:38:42] <xecycle> :(  This is a little overwhelming for me.  I think I shall rewrite that document in HTML.
[00:38:52] <Cork> or json
[00:39:06] <Cork> depending on if it's data or layout
[00:39:08] <xec_> well, what is the real reason you are using .html() ? to what end
[00:39:44] <xecycle> The document is a collection of underscore templates.
[00:40:25] <xecycle> Now that I read somewhere it's common practice to put such templates into <script type="some/weird-type">, I think I'd better follow this --- right?
[00:40:49] <xec_> yes, template shouldnt be xml really
[00:41:31] <xecycle> Okay then.  Luckily there are not so much to refactor yet.  Do you recommend placing such templates into the same HTML file or a separate one?
[01:01:20] <_mak> hi
[01:01:48] <_mak> it is possible to loop through the elements of an object?
[01:02:02] <Cork> ?.each
[01:02:03] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[01:02:37] <_mak> Cork, I've tried it with no results.. I try it again.. thanks
[01:05:32] <_mak> Cork, I get 'TypeError: t is undefined'
[01:05:54] <Cork> _mak: sounds like your not looping a jquery object
[01:06:00] <Cork> (or a dom element for that matter)
[01:06:01] <_mak> Cork, I'm trying with '$(r.errors).each()'
[01:06:19] <Cork> $.each(r.errors, function() {}
[01:06:33] <Cork> r.errors isn't a collection of dom elements
[01:06:34] <not_mike> who has been in here for 5+ hours?
[01:06:38] <_mak> r = Object { signed_email="ppp@pp.pp", kind="web", errors={...}, more...}
[01:06:50] <xec_> not_mike: not not_mike
[01:06:57] <not_mike> xec_ have you?
[01:07:01] <xec_> yes
[01:07:09] <_mak> Cork, what's r in my case then?
[01:07:14] <Cork> an object
[01:07:17] <not_mike> could you scroll up and get my jsfiddle link pretty please?
[01:07:32] <not_mike> posted maybe 2-3 hours ago about 4-5 times
[01:07:38] <_mak> Cork, can I loop through it?
[01:07:42] <Cork> not_mike: http://irc.jquery.com
[01:07:51] <not_mike> oh
[01:07:53] <Cork> _mak: yes
[01:07:58] <Cork> $.each(r.errors, function() {}) <--
[01:08:49] <not_mike> cork: the latest log is may 14th...
[01:08:57] <_mak> Cork, :*
[01:09:00] <_mak> thanks!
[01:09:33] <xec_> not_mike: is this the one? http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/2/
[01:10:04] <not_mike> yes! thanks much
[01:16:11] <xertion> I'm having an issue where changes happen in the Source code (Chrome Inspect element) but not on screen. Anyone recognize this?
[01:16:42] <xertion> I'm updating the .text() of a <textarea> continuesly. It updates in the source, but not on the screen of my browser.
[01:16:52] <xec_> try .val()
[01:17:46] <Cork> it's one of the tricky differences between source and dom :)
[01:18:22] <xertion> val() works.
[01:18:23] <xertion> thanks.
[01:18:25] <xertion> :-)
[01:18:29] <xec_> grouphug !
[01:31:30] <Nebros> is there a big diffrent between js and jquery? or is jquery only a good library for a lot of js?
[01:31:45] <lejocelyn> hi, I've got a problem with my ajax function that checks whether an email is or not in the database :http://pastebin.fr/27546
[01:31:49] <lejocelyn> any idea what's wrong
[01:32:04] <Cork> Nebros: the difference is that javascript is a language and jquery is a framework
[01:32:49] <Cork> lejocelyn: didn't you ask this yesterday too?
[01:33:03] <lejocelyn> Cork: almost yes but I didn't solve the problem
[01:33:07] <Nebros> i found there a good page, how to learn. but i didnt saw an explain, what it is. :)   http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/challenges/1
[01:33:11] <Cork> you can't return a value from the ajax
[01:33:11] <pallet> morning all
[01:33:21] <Cork> lejocelyn: you need to use the callbacks
[01:33:25] <lejocelyn> Cork: I'm not returning a value any more
[01:33:30] <Cork> yes you are
[01:33:34] <Cork> the valid_email
[01:33:36] <pallet> I need to click on a div and it work as a link, is that .location ?
[01:33:37] <lejocelyn> I'm assigning a variable
[01:33:46] <Cork> you try to use it before it's been set
[01:33:49] <lejocelyn> ah ok, both are not possible
[01:34:04] <lejocelyn> ok, I'll see about the callbacks then
[01:34:09] <lejocelyn> any exemple ?
[01:34:14] <Cork> as the success callback is called after line 45 ya
[01:34:23] <Cork> lejocelyn: use the done callback
[01:34:33] <Cork> and return it from the checkEmailInDB
[01:34:40] <Cork> and in the callback do the rest of the actions
[01:35:24] <Cork> that is return $.ajax(...);
[01:35:38] <Cork> checjkEmaiklInDB().done(function() {})
[01:35:59] <Cork> or use callbacks
[01:36:02] <Cork> ?.callbacks
[01:36:11] <Cork> bah
[01:36:18] <Cork> `api jQuery.callbacks
[01:36:19] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.Callbacks(): A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[01:36:55] <Cork> lejocelyn: but basically you need to pass a function from the event handler into the function
[01:37:09] <Cork> lejocelyn: and then in the function you pass in, do what you need to do with the response
[01:37:52] <not_mike> how do i shrink "box"? ->http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/113/
[01:38:01] <not_mike> on hover of showhide
[01:38:17] <not_mike> or, decrease width
[01:38:37] <Cork> width: '-=50'
[01:39:06] <lejocelyn> Cork: ok, I think I understand now
[01:39:08] <lejocelyn> thanks
[01:39:16] <Cork> good luck
[01:39:27] <pallet> $("#superhero").click(function() {...... this function works, but I need to be able to do the same function on #logo and #superhero
[01:39:49] <Cork> pallet: so give them a class and bind the class instead
[01:39:56] <pallet> ah ok
[01:40:11] <Cork> or you can list the id's in the selector
[01:40:22] <Cork> "#id1, #id2, #id3, #id4"
[01:40:37] <Cork> though it gets messy quite fast doing it that way
[01:42:14] <ThoMe> hihoi.
[01:42:29] <ThoMe> how I make a layer like http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ ?
[01:42:39] <not_mike> how do I shrink the width of "box" on hover of "showhide"? -> http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/113/
[01:42:42] <ThoMe> but without plugins, a little bit smaller ?
[01:43:14] <Cork> not_mike: like i said width: '-=50'
[01:43:34] <not_mike> oh, thanks
[01:43:42] <Cork> not_mike: also you need to do it on #box not showreel
[01:44:09] <not_mike> i'm decreasing box' width because i am increasing showreel's width
[01:45:29] <not_mike> i also have no idea what the hell I'm doing
[01:45:52] <not_mike> js is still greek to me
[01:46:29] <Nebros> i do not understand the diffrence between library and framework. i have read the wiki, but... i can use a class or function of a library and give variables, or i use framework, where i give variables and the function works. ^^
[01:47:09] <Cork> Nebros: a language is the language you write in; a framework is something someone creates to help do common tasks in the language
[01:48:14] <Nebros> yes i understood the diffrence between js and jquery. but whats the diffrence between a library and a framework?
[01:48:35] <Cork> a library is just a list of functions
[01:48:44] <Cork> it doesn't have any special meaning at all
[01:48:59] <seutje> a library is a set of tools, usually functions or objects with methods, a framework is a set of tools that helps setup things in a certain way, avoiding boilerplate code
[01:49:48] <seutje> jQuery is not a framework, Angular is
[01:49:52] <not_mike> cork
[01:50:06] <Cork> seutje: uh, ya jquery is a framework
[01:50:13] <seutje> although angular could also be considered a library
[01:50:18] <not_mike> where would i put -=width?
[01:50:32] <Cork> not_mike: in an animation call to #box
[01:50:39] <seutje> Cork: its framework capabilities are limited immo
[01:50:40] <ThoMe> how I make a layer like http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ ?
[01:50:43] <seutje> imo*
[01:50:47] <ThoMe> but a little bit smaller ?
[01:51:09] <seutje> Cork: how about this: backbone is the framework, but it uses underscore as a library?
[01:51:11] <not_mike> like this?: $('#box').stop().animate({ -=width: 200, opacity: 0 }, 'slow');
[01:51:24] <Cork> seutje: well it has a structure for how to extend it, and a common data structure
[01:51:33] <not_mike> If I wanted my box to go from 500px width to 200px width?
[01:51:54] <Cork> not_mike: no, not sure where you got -=width from
[01:52:04] <Cork> i said width: '-=200'
[01:52:16] <seutje> Cork: yeah, as I said, rather limited
[01:52:18] <not_mike> its 3:51am here
[01:52:21] <not_mike> my bad
[01:52:30] <seutje> it doesn't give you the tools to structure a complex app
[01:52:34] <Cork> and -= is for relative so you can just do =>  width: 200
[01:53:07] <Cork> seutje: well it does, though it is a thin layer
[01:53:14] <Cork> and not a thick layer like ex. extjs
[01:53:29] <seutje> I guess jQuery is a bad example
[01:53:33] <seutje> bad jQuery, bad!
[01:54:27] <Nebros> everyone use a car, but not many knows how the engine works... :D   it works, thats all. :P
[01:54:33] <not_mike> cork, my box just disappears now ->http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/114/
[01:54:48] <fabioportieri> seutje: what framework were you talking about that it's limited? backbone?
[01:55:09] <seutje> fabioportieri: jQuery
[01:55:10] <Nebros> you are all senior programmer in jquery (js)... not me :)
[01:55:30] <seutje> nah man, this is my first day using jQuery
[01:55:54] <lejocelyn> Cork: then, I don't understand something, success is a callback method that is called only when the data from the server arrived. So I should be able to do something like :
[01:55:59] <Cork> not_mike: http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/116/
[01:56:17] <lejocelyn>       success: function(data) {if(data.email){valid_email = false; }
[01:56:22] <Cork> no
[01:56:28] <Cork> your missing that ajax is async
[01:56:37] <not_mike> that's better, but i don't want the box to disappear
[01:56:41] <Cork> that means the code in the page continue to run after you call $.ajax
[01:56:42] <Nebros> i used jquery bevore, but didnt understood what i  copied into my project. i will chanche this now. i have now time to learn what i did... =)
[01:56:43] <not_mike> i just want it to shrink
[01:56:50] <lejocelyn> but isn't the point of success to wait for the data to come ?
[01:56:51] <Cork> and the function in the callback is called when the data arrives
[01:56:59] <jammin8_> Hello
[01:57:00] <Cork> the function yes
[01:57:06] <Cork> the code around it no
[01:57:26] <lejocelyn> but there's not code around what I showed you ?
[01:58:12] <lejocelyn> I mean, I still don't understand why the bit of code I just show you isn't executed
[01:58:13] <not_mike> got it!
[01:58:14] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://jsfiddle.net/j7fZ6/
[01:58:23] <Cork> this is another example of async
[01:58:31] <not_mike> changed the opacity of the first box animation function to 1
[01:58:50] <not_mike> inspired by your edit of the second box animation function's opacity to 1
[01:59:03] <not_mike> probably didn't say that right
[01:59:06] <not_mike> dont give a fuck
[01:59:13] <not_mike> thanks cork and xec
[01:59:15] <not_mike> i'm out
[01:59:18] <jammin8_> I'm trying to implement elFinder vith an ajax call (i'm loading the same javascripts again on that request) but i get this error: .elfinder is not a function
[01:59:20] <lejocelyn> Cork: I understand, but then, if the success callback method isn't executed asynchronically, what's it's purpose ?
[01:59:44] <lejocelyn>  s/it's/its
[01:59:54] <Cork> lejocelyn: uh. it IS executed astronomically, that is why you can't set the variable in the callback
[02:00:13] <lejocelyn> neither return something ?
[02:00:35] <jammin8_> can somebody help me? thanks
[02:00:45] <Cork> you're still missing what async means...
[02:01:01] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://jsfiddle.net/j7fZ6/1/
[02:01:11] <Cork> this is why setting it in the success callback doens't work
[02:01:29] <Cork> cause the variable is set too late for the code that runs outside the callback
[02:01:38] <Cork> as the callback runs AFTER the rest of the code
[02:02:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/j7fZ6/2/
[02:02:41] <lejocelyn> does it mean I technically can't set any variable inside a success callback ?
[02:03:21] <Cork> you can, but you have to make sure the code that needs it runs in a none sync stack to it (like an event callback)
[02:03:27] <Cork> and even then you have a risk of race
[02:03:37] <Cork> the point is not that you can't do something
[02:03:41] <lejocelyn> yes, I know about .done(), fail() and progress
[02:03:42] <Cork> it about when it happens
[02:03:58] <Cork> you miss the execution flow
[02:04:17] <lejocelyn> but my question is : why the bit of code inside the success function isn't even executed according to firebug
[02:04:58] <Cork> from my simple example it is: 1. first console log call, 2. setTimeout queues a timer callback, 3. console call, 4. second setTimeout call runs, 5. first timeout callback runs, 6. second timeout callback runs
[02:05:20] <lejocelyn> yes, I do understand but your code is still executed
[02:05:26] <Cork> sure
[02:05:33] <Cork> and so is yours
[02:05:37] <lejocelyn> no !!!
[02:05:43] <Nebros> i stressed Cork with my questions about every function of jquery, not many month ago. and for Cork's soul and nerve, i learn it now how to do it by myself. but im not only a person who want to learn the framework, i always try to understand the relationship. :)
[02:05:56] <lejocelyn> that's the problem, the code inside the success function isn't even executed
[02:06:01] <Cork> but you set a global variable and then try to check it from the code that run earlier
[02:06:46] <Cork> have you tried ex. adding a console.log inside the success callback function?
[02:07:14] <lejocelyn> when I put breakpoints inside the success bit here : http://jsfiddle.net/9Dgpf/ ; even thou the success is recognised, the code inside the function isn't executed
[02:07:34] <Cork> ok, and is the error callback called?
[02:07:51] <lejocelyn> no
[02:08:03] <Cork> is the network call ever made?
[02:08:26] <lejocelyn> yes, and I get the answer
[02:08:55] <lejocelyn> I tried multiple formats for the json empty answer
[02:09:06] <lejocelyn> [], {}, ""
[02:09:28] <Cork> check your console then, sounds like you would have some code error somewhere
[02:10:01] <mogaj> Getting error while file upload in jquery form the error is http://pastebin.com/3KFMnQNW
[02:10:12] <Cork> btw are you setting the correct response header from php?
[02:10:21] <Cork> lejocelyn: ^
[02:12:19] <lejocelyn> Cork: yes header("Content-Type: application/json", true);
[02:12:50] <Cork> and the url is what it is in the fiddle?
[02:12:55] <Cork> that means not cross domain?
[02:13:11] <LennyLinux> Hello, can anyone tell why this selection isn't working, please? http://jsfiddle.net/wTFgG/1/
[02:13:37] <LennyLinux> Oh, wait, i get it :\
[02:13:38] <lejocelyn> yes
[02:13:42] <Cork> LennyLinux: you don't have an attribute called top
[02:13:46] <lejocelyn> it is the url I actually use
[02:13:51] <Cork> LennyLinux: top use classes
[02:13:55] <Cork> *tip
[02:14:42] <Cork> lejocelyn: then i can't come up with much more without seeing the code in action
[02:14:54] <LennyLinux> I can't, values are set dynamically
[02:15:17] <Cork> well you can't select based on css
[02:15:23] <lejocelyn> Cork: yes but it's quite hard to settup an ajax/mysql/php environnement
[02:15:35] <Cork> or rather you can but YOU SHOULD'T ever do it

[02:17:00] <not_mike> how do I also shrink the youtube video inside "box" on hover of "showhide" ? -> http://jsfiddle.net/D5EMp/119/
[02:17:22] <Lost123> hi i am trying to open a page in jquery dialog, it works fine when i use <a href="www.target link">Click here</a> but not when i link an image like <a href="www.target link"><img src="myimage.png"/></a>
[02:17:33] <LennyLinux> Cork: i shuffle images and after have to found out and retrieve images adjacent to another one, what would be a better way than use css selection?
[02:17:50] <lejocelyn> Cork: can I do that check = checkEmailInDB("#hack"); ?
[02:17:55] <Cork> not_mike: those normally live in iframes, and they don't dynamically adjust
[02:18:12] <lejocelyn> and then check.done(function(){});
[02:18:12] <Cork> lejocelyn: if you mean check.done() later; yes, else no
[02:18:14] <not_mike> yes they do, I know of a site that does it
[02:18:15] <lejocelyn> yes
[02:18:17] <lejocelyn> ok
[02:18:18] <lejocelyn> thanks
[02:18:42] <Cork> not_mike: not dynamically; you need to adjust it
[02:18:49] <not_mike> How?
[02:19:00] <Cork> by setting its width and height values
[02:19:01] <not_mike> Is it possible on hover?
[02:19:05] <Cork> sure
[02:19:11] <Lost123> how can i make it such that i can say when image inside a tag is clicked, apply dialog on that a tag?
[02:19:16] <not_mike> do you know how?
[02:19:25] <Cork> same the other ones
[02:20:19] <Cork> Lost123: var tag = $('tag'); tag.on('click', 'img' function() { tag.addClass('something'); })
[02:20:24] <not_mike> i dont know the syntax to adjust an iframe. couldn't you point me in the right direction? send me a link of?
[02:20:41] <Cork> you have just done it 3 times
[02:20:42] <not_mike> I know with box is was just #box because it was an id
[02:20:52] <Cork> it isn't one syntax for each element in the dom page
[02:20:53] <not_mike> ...
[02:20:54] <Cork> it's just css
[02:20:59] <not_mike> #iframe?
[02:21:20] <Cork> that depends on what you want to use to select the element
[02:21:21] <not_mike> I don't know what you know
[02:21:46] <Cork> sounds like you need to learn basic css selectors

[02:22:28] <Lucaszz> hi
[02:22:30] <Cork> sigh
[02:23:20] <Cork> not_mike: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[02:23:55] <Lucaszz> I want to keep content of dialog inside my form marks. I used appendTo property of dialog box configuration. But its doesnt work. ui-dialog div is still just befor body mark.
[02:24:21] <Lucaszz> Using $.appendTo() is only way to do it
[02:24:22] <Lucaszz> ?
[02:24:24] <not_mike> ctrl-f: iframe 0 of 0
[02:24:27] <TheOneWolverine> hello, I am trying to load a javascript snippet via ajax.  I have tried with deferreds (when, getScript) in attempt to wait for this javascript snippet to be ready.  Am I on the right path working with deferreds to wait for this javascript snippet to load?
[02:24:38] <Cork> not_mike: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[02:25:14] <Cork> Lucaszz: ui dialogs has an inner div, and sometimes it can get out of sync with the rest of the dialog, sounds like that is what happens for you
[02:25:19] <not_mike> I meant that i ctrl-f'd "iframe" and got 0 results
[02:25:32] <Cork> TheOneWolverine: yes
[02:25:49] <TheOneWolverine> deferreds over async for loading this snippet?
[02:26:07] <Cork> not_mike: if you mean in the page, ya you normally can't select based on the attribute or tag names
[02:26:31] <Cork> TheOneWolverine: deferres is just a way to handle callbacks, it is still async
[02:27:06] <TheOneWolverine> sure, got it.
[02:27:46] <not_mike> cork, would it be box:iframe?
[02:27:51] <Cork> no
[02:27:56] <not_mike> or box.iframea
[02:28:09] <Cork> not_mike: like i said, you need to learn css selectors, you NEED to know how they work
[02:28:10] <Lost123> Cork: how can i get the a tag preceding an image when that image is clicked? $(".icon").click(){$(this).prev().find('a.modal').dialog();}); ?
[02:28:24] <not_mike> I can't do that right now, my brain is not functioning
[02:28:28] <Cork> not_mike: else you will have to ask in here for every element you ever want to work with
[02:28:29] <not_mike> 4:28 am here
[02:28:37] <Cork> then go and sleep
[02:28:43] <not_mike> no, i need to solve this
[02:28:44] <Cork> and then read the selector tutorial to morrow
[02:28:52] <not_mike> i will
[02:29:15] <Cork> Lost123: preceding as a sibling?
[02:29:22] <not_mike> wtf
[02:29:25] <not_mike> i know what this shit is
[02:29:44] <not_mike> how does it relate to js at all
[02:30:04] <Cork> not_mike: that is how you select elements
[02:30:18] <Cork> and that is how you build a selector to target the element for your animation
[02:30:22] <TheOneWolverine> which deferred should I be using to wait for the load of this javascript?  (Currently have tried load + done, fail, always but they always execute before the snippet has loaded)
[02:30:43] <Cork> TheOneWolverine: $.getScript().done(function() {})
[02:30:46] <Lost123> Cork: for example i am trying to get dialog on a tag the html is: <a href="target_link" class="modal"><img src="myimage.png' class="icon"></a>
[02:31:11] <Cork> so you want the parent?
[02:31:19] <Cork> ?.closest

[02:32:53] <Lost123> thanks
[02:33:23] <^^jfc^^> hello there, I have an small script to create an accordion with an UL. It is working ok, but the LI keeps opened when clicking on a new one. Any idea to close them when clicking on a new one LI? thanks in advance :) http://pastebin.com/jkKVTm1e
[02:33:47] <bambanx> hello
[02:34:05] <not_mike> lol fucking wow
[02:34:10] <not_mike> thanks cork for making me think
[02:34:26] <not_mike> herping today, derping tomorrow
[02:34:38] <Cork> ^^jfc^^: you mean you make your own accordion?
[02:34:44] <not_mike> (i got it)
[02:35:40] <bambanx> guys i need a hand with i am doing a thing on adobe edge and it uses a jquery for manage its stuff, this is a little api it have http://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/edgeanimate/api/current/index.html i am not expert in jquery , anyone can show me light for how i can know when the animation finish using jquery pls? thanks and sorry for my bad english
[02:35:42] <^^jfc^^> I didnt Cork, Im playing with the accordion based on this one http://www.jacklmoore.com/notes/jquery-accordion-tutorial/
[02:36:55] <Cork> ^^jfc^^: ok so your making your own (yes you copy someones code, but its not a ready made accordion)

[02:37:10] <bot-t> Cork, Accordion | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[02:38:05] <Cork> ^^jfc^^: i would go with adding the open class on the li element instead
[02:38:16] <^^jfc^^> thanks Cork, I tried with the jqueryui accordion, and that one worked really well, the problem is that Im working over a drupal cms and I had actually a lot of problems with jqueryUI
[02:38:24] <Cork> ^^jfc^^: that would give you better control on what should happen
[02:38:54] <Cork> ^^jfc^^: ya, that wasn't why i linked it; but you need to express that it isn't that accordian you're talking about
[02:38:59] <Cork> else it becomes confusing
[02:41:34] <Nephro> I'm using an onchange event handler for a text input field to do dynamic and fancy stuff, but the event is fired only when the input field loses focus after being changed. Is there a different event or a way to fire the same event after each actual change in the input field, Like entering a letter, or deleting one

[02:42:20] <Nephro> thanks you
[02:42:55] <^^jfc^^> thanks Cork, I just added the "open" class after clicking an element, the problem is that I dont know how to remove it, when clicking on a new one element as the open class keeps assigned to all the clicked elements
[02:43:44] <Cork> ^^jfc^^: $(this).closest('li').toggleClass('open')
[02:44:44] <Cork> or a better option might be $('.head .open').removeClass('open'); $(this).closest('li').addClass('open');
[02:44:45] <^^jfc^^> thanks Cork :)
[02:45:03] <Cork> if you want everyone to collapse when a new one is opened
[02:45:15] <^^jfc^^> great
[02:45:20] <^^jfc^^> thanks you very much
[02:50:04] <lejocelyn> is $.ajax able to parse, within its success callback method, an empty object like {} or will it cause the success not being executed ?
[02:50:23] <Cork> lejocelyn: ya it will
[02:50:30] <Cork> but you can't return an empty string though
[02:50:43] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('')
[02:50:46] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: JSON.parse
[02:50:47] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{}')
[02:50:48] <bot-t> Cork: {}
[02:51:16] <lejocelyn> ok, so that's not the reason why my success method isn't executed :'(
[02:52:00] <lejocelyn> I tried to trim it as well, didn't do any good
[02:52:29] <Cork> lejocelyn: are you using the json_encode command?
[02:52:37] <lejocelyn> yes
[02:52:48] <lejocelyn> echo json_encode (json_decode ("{}"));
[02:53:29] <lejocelyn> just to be sure :)
[02:54:15] <Cork> json_encode(Array());
[02:55:36] <lejocelyn> Cork: doesn't change anything
[02:55:51] <Cork> didn't think it would :)
[02:56:22] <lejocelyn> so why is it better to do it this way ?
[02:56:37] <Cork> less encoding
[02:57:21] <lejocelyn> so what else than bad json formatting could prevent the success of an ajax to be exectued ?
[02:57:39] <Cork> it's most likely not the format of the json causing anything
[02:57:50] <Cork> the error callback would be called if that was the case
[02:58:09] <lejocelyn> but I need to find a cause to be able to track down the error, no ?
[02:59:08] <Cork> yes, but the browser is where you need to look
[03:00:41] <lejocelyn> Firefox you think ?
[03:01:01] <Cork> uh, i meant you need to look at the code running
[03:01:10] <Cork> no i didn't mean it was a bug in the browser
[03:01:21] <not_mike> thanks to you, cork, i got something running exactly how i want it
[03:01:27] <not_mike> i want you tee see it, I pm'd you
[03:01:51] <Lost123> Cork: can you please see this paste http://pastie.org/7973373
[03:02:53] <not_mike> nevermind then
[03:02:56] <not_mike> going to bed
[03:03:42] <Cork> Lost123: have you verified that the event hander is called?
[03:09:57] <lejocelyn> Cork: I think I found out the problem, data isn't defined, neither textStatus, but the jqXHR is if I passit to the success function. (according to firebug)
[03:12:34] <Lost123> yes Cork  its being called
[03:12:57] <Lost123> in console i got this line Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html: "http://target_link".
[03:13:00] <Cork> and $(this).closest('.modal').length > 0 ?
[03:13:15] <Cork> ah
[03:13:28] <Cork> ugg.. thought wrong there
[03:13:48] <Cork> ok, 1. you have a broken a tag, if anything it should be "target_link"
[03:14:09] <Cork> 2. you might want to do event.stopPropagation() in the click action
[03:14:16] <Cork> else you will click the link when you click the image
[03:14:33] <Unh0ly_Tigg> If I have a variable storing the html contents (from calling $.ajax), what's the simplist way to get the contents of a tag with a certain id (eg: #content) from that variable?
[03:15:02] <Cork> depends how the structure is of the html
[03:15:04] <Lost123> where to use event.stopPropagation() in the pastie i showed you?
[03:15:26] <Cork> bug if its a child of one of the outer parents do $(variable).find('#content')
[03:15:37] <Cork> Lost123: in the click handler
[03:16:16] <Lost123> before i create the dialog?
[03:16:20] <Unh0ly_Tigg> just using a template page that loads content from other pages, just wanted to condense my files
[03:16:38] <Cork> Lost123: at the top of the handler yes
[03:18:47] <Sendoushi> guys... i'm making an each for children('table') everything works fine, i do an if for attribute and no problems but then i do: $j(this).children('tr.days') and even if i just children tr... it won't give me anything and of course... there is tr inside
[03:19:07] <Sendoushi> ideas on why?
[03:19:12] <Cork> ?.find @ Sendoushi
[03:19:13] <bot-t> Sendoushi, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[03:19:19] <Cork> tr isn't a child of table
[03:19:28] <Cork> tbody, thead or tfoot is
[03:19:40] <Sendoushi> oh ... find seems better than children on most cases thanks
[03:19:41] <Sendoushi> :9
[03:19:46] <Sendoushi> didn't know about that func
[03:20:08] <Cork> ya, it's normally what you want
[03:20:42] <Unh0ly_Tigg> how do i convert from a string to an html element?
[03:21:10] <Cork> ?.parseHTML
[03:21:13] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".parseHTML" in jQuery Docs.
[03:21:18] <Cork> ?jQuery.parseHTML

[03:21:27] <Unh0ly_Tigg> ahh, thanks
[03:21:33] <Cork> or just $('<html string>')
[03:22:13] <Lost123> Cork:  no event.stopPropagation(); stops everything, like it doesn't even create a pop up
[03:22:31] <Cork> Lost123: do you get any errors?
[03:22:36] <Lost123> previously it did create a pop uu but keeps loading and doesnt show the required page
[03:22:44] <Lost123> nopes not with event.stopPropagation();
[03:22:55] <Cork> Lost123: opps forgot to mention you need to add event as the first argument to the function
[03:23:15] <Lost123> like how? please write the syntax
[03:23:17] <Cork> function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); $(this).closest() }
[03:25:19] <Lost123> $(".email_icon").(function(click){event.stopPropagation(); this.closest();} ?
[03:25:26] <Cork> uh.. no
[03:25:41] <Cork> check the old code you have you should be able to see what you should replace
[03:26:30] <nastyCreeper> hi
[03:26:46] <nastyCreeper> i need to do stuff() when user is about to close the page
[03:26:52] <nastyCreeper> tab or browser window
[03:26:58] <nastyCreeper> any suggestions?
[03:27:17] <Cork> only option is unload
[03:27:28] <Cork> though there is quite a bit of limitations to what you can do
[03:27:28] <nastyCreeper> Cork: what is it?
[03:27:37] <Cork> ?g mdn onunload

[03:27:47] <Cork> nastyCreeper: you can't
[03:27:50] <nastyCreeper> why?
[03:28:01] <Cork> cause the browser won't let you
[03:28:08] <nastyCreeper> any workarounds?
[03:28:13] <Cork> don't do it?
[03:28:19] <nastyCreeper> i want to
[03:28:41] <lejocelyn> it's really weird, if I do : success:function(data, status, XML){alert("test");} // the status variable get assigned : "" ; else, nothing is assigned
[03:28:48] <Cork> it's a VERY common solution from old popunder/popup ads things
[03:29:03] <Cork> nastyCreeper: so browsers block it quite actively
[03:29:13] <Lost123> thankss Cork
[03:29:16] <Cork> nastyCreeper: only option is to have the user disalbe there popup blocker
[03:29:23] <Lost123> i got it but still same error Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html:
[03:29:23] <Cork> *disable
[03:29:41] <Cork> Lost123: so your loading html from the server, and tries to give it to an img tag
[03:29:52] <Cork> then check what resource your loading
[03:30:20] <Lost123> its an html file which i am loading
[03:30:48] <Cork> then the dialog thingy you're using seams to expect it to be an image for some reason
[03:31:02] <Lost123> like i need to open another page in a dialog on click of a link which wraps an img tag
[03:32:43] <Cork> Lost123: btw why are you binding the click on the image and not the link?
[03:32:50] <Cork> looks kinda weird
[03:33:40] <nastyCreeper> hi
[03:33:59] <Lost123> Cork:  because $(document).ready(function(){ 	 		 			$('.modal').simpleDialog({closeSelector: '#hideDialog'}); doesn't work when it wraps an img tag
[03:34:05] <nastyCreeper> i need to add event handler that triggers when element X will be clicked after element Y
[03:34:13] <Lost123> i mean when the a.modal wraps an img tag
[03:34:15] <Cork> Lost123: why not?
[03:34:17] <nastyCreeper> but i can't seem to find suitable event in jquery
[03:34:47] <Cork> nastyCreeper: you would have to store that element 1 has been clicked
[03:34:56] <Cork> nastyCreeper: and then check that variable in event 2
[03:35:17] <pradeep> how can i fire a function after each jquery mobile ajax request
[03:35:42] <daniel_-> Hi all! anyone can help me with my selector? I have <div class="feed" data-id="1"> in my html. When I use $(".post[data-id='1']") it gives me an empty array
[03:35:44] <lemonsparrow> hi all
[03:36:13] <Cork> daniel_-: [data-id='1'].post
[03:36:20] <nastyCreeper> Cork: i need to run that handler right after element 1 was clicked
[03:36:29] <Cork> daniel_-: element[attribute].classes:sub-selectors
[03:37:00] <Cork> nashant: you can't click two elements at the same time
[03:37:20] <Cork> *psudo-selectors
[03:37:45] <daniel_-> Cork: $("[data-id='1']").feed ?
[03:37:53] <nastyCreeper> Cork: any ideas?
[03:38:17] <Cork> daniel_-: i meant the order of a selector is  element[attribute].classes:psudo-selector
[03:38:28] <Cork> daniel_-: you can't write attribute after the class
[03:39:09] <Cork> nastyCreeper: opps wrong nick: "you can't click two elements at the same time"
[03:39:21] <nastyCreeper> Cork: not at the same time
[03:39:26] <nastyCreeper> it's like this:
[03:39:42] <Cork> then how would you know that element 2 will be clicked when element 1 is clicked?
[03:39:43] <nastyCreeper> 1) user clicks element X ; 2) trigger is fired ; 3) user clicks element Y
[03:39:51] <nastyCreeper> how can i do it?
[03:39:58] <Cork> bind a click handler on element x
[03:40:15] <nastyCreeper> Cork: but how to check if element Y will be clicked next?
[03:40:16] <Cork> you can't know what happens in the future
[03:40:24] <Cork> you can't
[03:40:27] <Cork> how would you?
[03:40:28] <nastyCreeper> ?
[03:40:28] <nastyCreeper> why?
[03:40:30] <Cork> time travel?
[03:40:34] <nastyCreeper> why?
[03:40:42] <Cork> cause the user haven't clicked it yet
[03:40:45] <nastyCreeper> it's all within context of same document
[03:40:49] <Cork> so how would the browser know
[03:40:54] <nastyCreeper> Cork: but it is about to click
[03:40:56] <nastyCreeper> isn't it?
[03:41:00] <Cork> uh...
[03:41:07] <Cork> how would the browser know that?
[03:41:26] <Cork> in 200 ms from know the user will click element y???
[03:41:32] <Cork> *now
[03:41:43] <nastyCreeper> i don't need to measure time delay
[03:41:52] <Cork> sure it would be neat, but it's not possible
[03:41:54] <nastyCreeper> imagine i just have elements X, Y and Z
[03:41:57] <Cork> lol
[03:42:04] <Lost123> if i use $('.modal').simpleDialog({closeSelector: '#hideDialog'}); in dom ready with the html  <a href="/notes.php?public=1" class="modal" rel="simpleDialog2"><img class="email_icon" src="images/email_icon.png"></a> this gives me the same error that resource interpreted as image but tranferred as html
[03:42:13] <nastyCreeper> after he clicks X, i need to run my trigger only if he will click Y next, and not Z
[03:42:14] <Cork> nastyCreeper: the point is, the code can't know if something will happen
[03:42:23] <nastyCreeper> Cork: why?
[03:42:28] <Cork> nastyCreeper: ...
[03:42:33] <nastyCreeper> ?
[03:42:38] <Cork> cause we're talking about code, not magic
[03:42:51] <Cork> it can't know what will happen IN THE FUTURE
[03:42:51] <nastyCreeper> what does magic have to do anything with it
[03:42:57] <nastyCreeper> Cork: thats not future
[03:42:59] <Lost123> lol
[03:43:02] <nastyCreeper> its just a sequence
[03:43:12] <nastyCreeper> can be represented as array of clicks etc
[03:43:34] <Cork> nastyCreeper: you have 1. element x is clicked, 2. will 3 happen? (how would anyone know), 3. clicked
[03:43:54] <nastyCreeper> Cork: yes, that was my question
[03:43:59] <nastyCreeper> how can i know that
[03:44:06] <daniel_-> Cork: thx for the info but I cant get to select <div class="feed" data-id="1">
[03:44:18] <Cork> nastyCreeper: you have 1. element x is clicked, 2. store x was clicked 3. elemeny y is clicked, 4. was x clicked? if yes, do x+y
[03:44:38] <Cork> nastyCreeper: you can't ever trigger on something that haven't happened yet
[03:44:51] <Cork> you can GUESS that it MIGHT happen, but that is guessing and not an event
[03:45:08] <Cork> and most likely you will have just as many false possitives as false negatives
[03:45:24] <Cork> (and as many none false :P )
[03:46:07] <Cork> closest i could give you would be something like if(Math.floor(Math.rand(1))) { /* will be clicked */ }
[03:46:09] <nastyCreeper> [13:44] <Cork> nastyCreeper: you have 1. element x is clicked, 2. store x was clicked 3. elemeny y is clicked, 4. was x clicked? if yes, do x+y
[03:46:15] <nastyCreeper> why did you put event triggering in the end?
[03:46:23] <nastyCreeper> it must happen after 1)
[03:46:42] <Cork> cause you would have to wait for the second element to be clicked to know that both the first and last element is clicked
[03:47:21] <nastyCreeper> why?
[03:47:24] <Cork> ...
[03:47:29] <Cork> are you trolling me??
[03:47:31] <nastyCreeper> no
[03:47:34] <Cork> seriously...
[03:47:56] <Cork> you don't find it logical that you can't listen for an event about something that happens in the future?
[03:48:05] <Cork> and trigger it now
[03:48:10] <nastyCreeper> you haven't explained why is that logical
[03:48:16] <nastyCreeper> sure i don't take your words for it
[03:48:19] <Cork> yes i have like 3-4 times
[03:48:35] <Cork> an event is triggered by a user action
[03:48:37] <nastyCreeper> no. you put "was x clicked" in 4) for some reason
[03:48:41] <nastyCreeper> it must be 2)
[03:48:48] <Cork> it can't trigger based on a users intention to do an action
[03:48:54] <nastyCreeper> why?
[03:49:08] <Cork> cause it haven't happened yet?
[03:49:33] <nastyCreeper> Cork: but it is about to happen
[03:49:47] <daniel_-> Cork: thx its working now!
[03:50:41] <Cork> nastyCreeper: ok, i'm going to mark that question as trolling, you're free to ask another question, but i won't answer that one again
[03:51:01] <nastyCreeper> Cork: that wasn't trolling
[03:51:08] <nastyCreeper> ok i will think of something else
[03:51:39] <nastyCreeper> Cork: what if i will track mouse movement to element Y ?
[03:51:42] <nastyCreeper> detect *
[03:51:46] <nastyCreeper> is it impossible, too?
[03:52:06] <Cork> you can track mouse movement on element y yes
[03:52:20] <Cork> if you want to track mouse movement at all you would have to bind it on the document
[03:52:32] <Cork> *on all elements
[03:52:47] <nastyCreeper> Cork: so, any working example?
[03:55:04] <Cork> $(document).on('mousemove', function(event) {});
[03:55:31] <nastyCreeper> Cork: working exampleof event triggered when users is about to click element Y
[03:55:49] <nastyCreeper> you said it is possible to do using mouse tracking
[03:57:41] <Cork> sigh
[03:58:11] <Cork> no i still don't have a way to make precognitive event handlers
[04:00:33] <FrameFever> I want to detach children from a paren tag?
[04:00:36] <FrameFever> how can I do this?
[04:03:01] <Cork> ?.detatch
[04:03:04] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".detatch" in jQuery Docs.
[04:03:13] <Cork> ?.dettach
[04:03:15] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".dettach" in jQuery Docs.
[04:03:45] <Cork> uh...
[04:03:52] <Cork> bot-t: are you boorked to day?
[04:03:52] <bot-t> Cork, Concentrate and ask again.
[04:04:07] <Cork> ah, no but my spelling it
[04:04:11] <Cork> ?.detach @ FrameFever
[04:04:11] <bot-t> FrameFever, .detach([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[04:04:22] <Cork> *is
[04:04:44] <FrameFever> Cork: why do I not see what the return value of detach is?
[04:05:09] <Cork> FrameFever: cause it returns a normal jquery object
[04:05:38] <Cork> var children = $(parent).children(); children.detach();
[04:06:58] <Nebros> $("#destinations li");    or     $("#destinations").find("li");   ...   i found this:  It takes a bit more code, but it’s faster.    why it is faster?
[04:08:11] <Cork> Nebros: the first one uses querySelectorAll and search for the li with a parent of #destinations
[04:08:36] <Cork> the second uses document.getElementById('destinations').querySelectorAll('li')
[04:08:51] <Cork> so it only looks for li's in the first target
[04:09:11] <Nebros> ok, make sense
[04:09:16] <Cork> though the speed difference should depend per browser
[04:09:30] <Cork> cause i would expect browsers to optimize for that selector
[04:14:19] <FrameFever> Cork: yeah, but why isn't this documented?
[04:14:33] <Cork> FrameFever: cause it normally doesn't matter
[04:14:42] <Cork> and it isn't a straight thing to answer
[04:15:10] <FrameFever> it is very important
[04:15:19] <FrameFever> do know the return value
[04:15:45] <Cork> oh wait sorry wrong nick
[04:15:52] <Cork> that was about the speed difference
[04:16:14] <Cork> FrameFever: it is documented, but all the jquery functions return the original jquery object
[04:16:25] <Cork> only the exception is documented
[04:16:38] <Cork> and those are quite few
[04:17:05] <Cork> *documented explicitly on the function page
[04:29:03] <Nebros> http://bpaste.net/show/ork4xUlbJg94W4MuAPls/   line 30-33, marks these 4 always the same part?
[04:30:19] <Cork> ?p @ Nebros
[04:30:20] <bot-t> Nebros, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:30:27] <Cork> preferably make a running example
[04:31:52] <teza19> Hi all, I am trying (what I thought to be) a basic jQuery form validation script. I want to validate the extension before the submit button is activated, but it isn't working! ---> http://jsfiddle.net/usqyA/
[04:33:59] <padolsey> teza19: Works for me -- you need to ensure you're including the jQuery lib in your JSFiddle (left-hand sidebar)
[04:35:18] <teza19> wow. it doesn't work on my website...
[04:36:00] <teza19> (jquery lib is included on my site)
[04:39:31] <teza19> I can't put my finger on why it works on JSFiddle but not on my page.
[04:40:33] <seutje> teza19: are you executing your script at the top or the bottom of the page?
[04:40:42] <seutje> jsfiddle wraps it all in a window load
[04:40:46] <teza19> the JQuery is at the top
[04:40:52] <seutje> yeah, don't do that
[04:41:14] <teza19> can I ask why?
[04:41:16] <seutje> `g yslow
[04:41:16] <b-ot> seutje: Yahoo! YSlow for Mobile/Bookmarklet → http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/
[04:41:27] <seutje> http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom
[04:41:45] <teza19> thank you - and that worked.
[04:42:03] <seutje> teza19: if u put it at the top, u'll need to wrap it in a document ready handler so it only gets executed after the document is parsed
[04:42:27] <seutje> if u put it at the bottom the document is parsed by the time it hits ur script, eliminating the need for an event handler
[04:42:35] <seutje> or rather "event handler"
[04:42:52] <teza19> I'm happy with it at the bottom :) that's great to know - thank you very much! If I put 'too many' scripts at the bottom, will that cause an issue?
[04:45:18] <teza19> Also, is there a way I can change that script to make it permit different extensions for different 'upload' fields. I don't mind running the script twice. Assuming the change needs to be made here --> $('INPUT[type="file"]').change(function () { <-- but not sure exactly what change to make.
[04:52:38] <Nebros> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/7hTGF/   mark all 4 variants from the field "JavaScript" the red colored part?
[04:57:09] <lejocelyn> is jquery ables to work with rekonq ?
[04:57:54] <Cork> Nebros: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/7hTGF/1/
[04:58:05] <Cork> lejocelyn: why wouldn't it?
[04:58:34] <lejocelyn> Cork: I've got issues actually with jquery ui and rekonq
[04:58:41] <lejocelyn> autocomplete seems not to work
[04:58:45] <Cork> lejocelyn: jquery depends on the normal web standards; so any browser works as long as the browser supports the standard
[04:58:56] <lejocelyn> while it works with other browsers
[04:59:13] <Cork> might be a bug in the browser
[04:59:38] <ENK|2> hello, I make a multilevel horizontal menu this is easy: http://pastebin.com/B4mAt0rH But now try make "active element" all time visible, I think can use .not('.active') for not make hdden  actual element but not work, any can help me??
[04:59:42] <Nebros> Cork: is this a yes now? ^^
[05:00:00] <Cork> Nebros: it's a i don't see the problem
[05:01:01] <Nebros> the 4 lines... i need to know, if all 4 have the same effect. are they all mark the same part?
[05:01:34] <Nebros> 4 variants to mark the same part or is one of them wrong?
[05:02:10] <ENK|2> this is my wrong code http://pastebin.com/SEcrx53f
[05:23:37] <moofy> Okay so this has been bugging me, why is jquery now adding a style tag to body
[05:23:46] <moofy> so it's <body style>
[05:23:57] <deepy> Are you sure that it's jQuery that does it?
[05:24:38] <deepy> Becuase it doesn't for me :>
[05:24:53] <moofy> seems to be.
[05:25:04] <moofy> with jquery disabled it's not
[05:25:05] <deepy> www.jsbin.com show us a testcase
[05:25:06] <ravenzz> maybe some script is removing some class form it
[05:25:36] <moofy> nothing else is getting loaded
[05:25:53] <deepy> Should be easy to show us then :-)
[05:26:00] <deepy> But more to the point, does it make any difference?
[05:26:52] <moofy> Noctrl, but it's one of those things, where you're like, what the hell is doing this
[05:26:55] <moofy> sigh
[05:26:57] <moofy> No*
[05:27:14] <Noctrl> :P
[05:27:21] <teza19> hello, ravenzz helped me with this (http://jsfiddle.net/bJuYE/3/) is there any way to make the submit button become active once BOTH isntances are valid?
[05:28:37] <ravenzz> teza19 take in mind that's probably not the best solution possible... so ask for other opinions
[05:29:39] <ravenzz> I can help you with this later... if noone does it before
[05:29:40] <ravenzz> bbl
[05:31:51] <krad> hi.  i want a vertical listview that implements scrolling too.  is that available for jquery mobile?
[05:34:39] <moofy> It's like absolutely jquery
[05:34:51] <moofy> commenting it out removes the <body script>
[05:35:43] <moofy> weird.
[05:36:17] <TheOneWolverine> I have a jquery deferred (done,fail,always) checking another page for a js snippet to be loaded dynamically.  The page containing the js snippet shows a 404 (or a blank template) until ready.
[05:36:26] <TheOneWolverine> How can I query the deferred request multiple times to check if the response or status code has changed?
[05:37:39] <seutje> `jqapi isresolved
[05:37:45] <lejocelyn_> Cork: in the end, I think the error is a json ill formed :(
[05:38:25] <seutje> `jqapi deferred.isresolved
[05:38:36] <seutje> b-ot: screw you!
[05:38:38] <seutje> TheOneWolverine: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.isResolved/
[05:38:50] <seutje> oh, no wonder
[05:38:55] <seutje> `jqapi state
[05:39:02] <seutje> `jqapi deferred.state
[05:39:23] <seutje> y u no?
[05:39:42] <TheOneWolverine> state is new, isresolved deprecated. Thank you!
[05:39:42] <lejocelyn_> $.parseJSON(data) returns SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[05:40:25] <TheOneWolverine> Does this make the request only one time?  Or multiple times until the page is resolved?
[05:42:11] <seutje> TheOneWolverine: if u call it only one time, sure
[05:42:39] <seutje> TheOneWolverine: wait, the request? yeah, once, I suppose...
[05:42:59] <TheOneWolverine> So is the elegant solution here to use interval timers until a change is detected? (ie the change being from a 404 to a 200)

[05:56:16] <amcsi_work> hi
[05:56:38] <amcsi_work> how do I tell if an object is a jquery object or a dom element as opposed to any other object or type?
[05:57:14] <krad> is there a framework that builds on jquery mobile to give me more UI controls?
[05:59:32] <Nemurenai> krad, there's one built on jQuery called Bootstrap. It has a lot of neat features
[06:00:11] <krad> all i'm loooking for is a scrollable listview
[06:00:14] <Nemurenai> It should be possible to combine the two, but I haven't tried
[06:01:52] <Nemurenai> hm, I don't know about listviews though...
[06:02:21] <krad> well basically i want a menu of categories that users can vertical scroll
[06:02:35] <lejocelyn> Cork: here the code does return false : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11663867/check-if-email-address-already-exists-in-the-database-using-jquery-and-php

[06:22:28] <rindolf> Hi all.
[06:30:48] <darkfrog> Is there not a KeyCode object that has a mapping between code and name?  So you can do things like: if (event.keyCode == KeyCode.Escape) { ... } ?
[06:32:24] <granden> Hi, I got like this today, http://pastebin.com/E5BkS6cF but I would like to use .on in some way so that it would work if I dynamicly adds new links with the class a.
[06:33:18] <Lucaszz> Does IE support Object.prototype ?
[06:33:33] <granden> I tried, doing like $(document).on('click','.remove', function(){
[06:33:38] <granden> but then it would not work at all.
[06:37:03] <Schonert> Hej Guys. Howcome the serialize skips appended elements?
[06:38:06] <lenswipee> anyone a pro in css let me know in private because i'm pulling my hair out with ie9
[06:38:48] <pachet> Lucaszz yes, all versions in recent memory
[06:39:00] <pachet> i wouldnt recommend tinkering with Object.prototype though :[
[06:40:44] <Lucaszz> why ?
[06:40:54] <pachet> granden what's wrong with $(document).on('click.mynamespace', 'a.remove', fn) ?
[06:41:36] <seutje> Lucaszz: because it affects everything and will force you to use hasOwnProperty when for looping over an object
[06:41:49] <seutje> Lucaszz: any code that loops over an object and doesn't do this, will fail horribly
[06:41:49] <Lucaszz> I want to use object prototype like there: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype#Examples
[06:41:56] <Lucaszz> what do you think
[06:41:56] <Lucaszz> ?
[06:42:14] <seutje> Lucaszz: that's fine, as it isn't the Object.prototype ur fucking with
[06:42:26] <seutje> but rather someRandomCustomObject.prototype
[06:42:45] <darkfrog> FYI, I found what I was looking for: https://github.com/abutterf/javascript-keycode-jelly
[06:44:18] <Lucaszz> seutje: Any disadvantages of using objects like from my link /
[06:45:05] <seutje> Lucaszz: not really, xcept that the references you create stay in memory as long as they are accessible, so u might wanna keep that in mind and not expose too many
[06:46:13] <haiQt> Hi guys, I'm writing a basic jQuery plugin and one of the functions is a $.get that returns the data when it's done loading. I now want to access this value in one of my other functions (I call it for example by using console.log(this.getTemplate('slider')), but it returns undefined which is logical. I know I need to implement some sort of promise, but I've never done that before and I'm pretty confused. Can anyone help me out, please

[06:59:24] <samtuke> Hi, how can I prevent my checkboxes being automatically wrapped in a div? The div causes layout bugs when checkboxes are included in jquerymobile tables
[07:01:59] <drmarvelous> checkboxes shouldn't automatically be wrapped in a div, are you using any extra scripts?
[07:02:13] <drmarvelous> (validation, or something similar?)
[07:09:13] <mac_nibblet> Gah
[07:09:21] <mac_nibblet> $.param fails to serialize a object to string properly
[07:09:25] <haiQt> rindolf: I actually figured it out a bit earlier, sorry for not responding sooner. Now the getTemplate function just returns the jqxhr object and i use jqxhr.done( code here... ) to make it work :) Thanks for the help anyway!

[07:13:13] <CrysAk> Hi guys, I;m using a jquery scroll function to load more results whent he user scrolls to the bottom of the page, however this sometimes gets stuck in a loop, nay idea how to force this to only trigger once unless the user has since scrolled down again? this is the one i;m using "if ($(window).scrollTop() == $(document).height() - $(window).height()){}"
[07:14:34] <money> Anyone having trouble accessing jquery.com from New York?

[07:18:43] <samtuke> drmarvelous, no, no additional scripts, but using jquery mobile
[07:19:30] <samtuke> drmarvelous, hmm, I'm using smarty templates though. I don't think that would inject divs, but I'll check
[07:32:58] <MarcGuay> $(window).scroll() gets fired after a scrollTop animation is completed if there is still some space to be scrolled.  Any idea why this is or what can be done to stop it?   http://jsfiddle.net/375kC/
[07:39:30] <MarcGuay> Can anyone suggest a jQuery slider/carousel plugin that can be vertically centered with CSS?
[07:51:31] <DarsVaeda> how do I continue in a $.each() ?
[07:51:37] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why I'm getting the 'object is not a function' error in this piece of inline code that came with my framework?   -   if ($(this).val() !== '10' || confirmationPin()) update_order_status('{{ OrderId|raw }}', this.options[this.selectedIndex].value, this.options[this.selectedIndex].text);
[07:52:07] <DeltaHeavy> confirmationPin(); is causing the issue, not sure why though. This is the original code - http://pastebin.com/J0E87csq
[07:52:17] <DeltaHeavy> Sorry for the inline JS, not my code, just the e-commerce platform I"m using =/
[07:53:16] <Sh4d0> DarsVaeda: just return something.
[07:53:27] <DarsVaeda> ah okay, thanks
[08:06:05] <horrror> i have this several divs of the same class.. on scroll i'm changing their class to "sticky" (menu) and they all get sticky one by one. the problem is, is that I want the previous to disappear and have only one div acts as sticky
[08:06:11] <horrror> any ideas?
[08:09:04] <Siecje> I have this code to change a span when it is expanded but it changes all spans in that div http://dpaste.org/9OPzr/
[08:12:19] <AdamPDotty> Siecje: not clear what you want, maybe $(this).prev('span');
[08:14:26] <Siecje> http://dpaste.org/2sQp8/
[08:14:51] <Siecje> so it changes both of those spans
[08:17:47] <horrror> ok so i've narrowed the problem; if suddenly a div is generated (Through other script) with the same class that I want to make the first one disappear
[08:18:06] <horrror> I tried this (forgive me , it's only two lines)
[08:18:08] <horrror> if($('.sticky-thumbset').length > 1) {
[08:18:08] <horrror> 		$('.sticky-thumbset').first().fadeOut();
[08:18:12] <horrror> but didn't work :o
[08:20:09] <Siecje> AdamPDotty: http://dpaste.org/gtfje/ did you mean like this ? this doesn't change the span anymore
[08:20:22] <AdamPDotty> Siecje: for hide: $(this).prev().find('span')
[08:20:44] <AdamPDotty> span inside the previous sibling
[08:22:00] <DeltaHeavy> How can I have a function do something, then pending an event only THEN return a value?
[08:22:46] <Siecje> Adam doesn't change back to +
[08:25:25] <Siecje> http://dpaste.org/JDpLI/
[08:27:07] <AdamPDotty> Lets start with basics. Are you sure the hide-event is called?
[08:28:28] <AdamPDotty> you could test with just $('span').text('++');
[08:32:16] <Siecje> AdamPDotty: yeah that works but it changes both
[08:33:41] <horrror> how can i access the first element of a class? I tried first() but it only available for the first instance of the array (so if I delete the first one its nill)
[08:36:37] <AdamPDotty> hmmm
[08:38:20] <AdamPDotty> than another try: $('a[href=#'+this.id+'] span').text('+');
[08:38:26] <AdamPDotty> e
[08:40:47] <Siecje> same thing
[08:41:51] <Siecje> i can expand both but when i shrink the inside it changes the outside to a + even though it is still expanded
[08:46:05] <AdamPDotty> can you debug this.id ?
[08:47:38] <Siecje> how?
[08:48:05] <AdamPDotty> firebug o chrome developer tool or alert(this.id);
[08:50:56] <Siecje> collapseSix
[08:51:18] <Siecje> but then right after collapseFive
[08:53:00] <AdamPDotty> so your event bubbles up to collapse5
[08:53:54] <AdamPDotty> maybe have a look at stopPropagation()
[08:54:50] <AdamPDotty> I dont really now what triggers the hide-event
[08:56:49] <Siecje> I am using twitter bootstraps accordion if that helps
[09:00:24] <Siecje> another question is how to refresh the page with the accordion expanded
[09:00:38] <Siecje> like if I put a form inside the accordion and the form does not validate
[09:01:30] <monk3y> Hey all, stoopid-question-warning, and Google isn't helping; is it possible to use jQuery to submit two forms on a page to produce their output in two separate _blank targets at the same time?
[09:05:04] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: I dont see how that would be possible.
[09:05:36] <c4ptnh00k2> one submit at a time
[09:05:44] <monk3y> I'm already running both .submit()s one after the other, but they're both pumping the response into the same _blank page .. therefore whichever is last is what gets rendered.
[09:05:57] <c4ptnh00k2> exactly
[09:06:40] <monk3y> Right .. so is that an issue with .submit on the parent page .. or is that the semantics of targetting blank; ie you can't have more than 1 _blank page? (security issue etc)
[09:08:02] <c4ptnh00k2> yup but there is a work around
[09:09:04] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: you here/still pinging?
[09:09:27] <c4ptnh00k2> you could always just catch the request before it submits and make a separate ajax call yourself. This would allow you to "submit" them both at the same time.
[09:10:32] <monk3y> Yeah I'm submitting them with jQuery; not a submit button.  And I thought it was an issue with the first submit not coming back to call the second submit .. but as I said the second submit gets rendered to blank, so I think the first works, it just gets trampled by the second response into blank.
[09:11:00] <monk3y> And I'd combine the outputs, but one response is HTML, the other is PDF.
[09:11:16] <c4ptnh00k2> if they are sepparate calls then they will be executed sepperatly. There may be something else wrong here
[09:11:39] <monk3y> Yeah, I'm thinking that each submits to _blank, and "There Can Be Only One".
[09:11:42] <c4ptnh00k2> even elem.submit() is still submitting the form
[09:12:05] <monk3y> Yeah I know, that's why I thought giving it a target wouldn't submit the parent, but open the child and run the request/response there.
[09:12:32] <monk3y> I even get console.logs before/after each submit, so they're both being executed.
[09:12:36] <c4ptnh00k2> nope. you should just handle this as a click()
[09:13:18] <c4ptnh00k2> jsfiddle?
[09:13:23] <monk3y> Ah, it's kinda happening after a file (of data) is uploaded and processed, then that triggers $('#hiddenForm1').submit(), $('#hiddenForm2').submit().
[09:13:44] <burg> hello. for a jqueryui slider, how can i get the ui.handle from the moment the slider has been created?
[09:14:31] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: I thought of making a fiddle, but was gambling as to whether I'd get a suggested fix faster than mocking it up in fiddle.
[09:15:36] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: well I gave you a suggested fix. If you don't believe that will work then I need to see why your application is special.
[09:16:26] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: I'm fiddling as we speak (ahem), but in the mean-time; by your fix do you mean catching the first submit and making an ajax call for the second?
[09:19:14] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: no so basically $("selector").click(call ajax function 1 here then call number 2);
[09:20:13] <Sneedlwoods> Hi
[09:20:24] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: Alright, totally get that two ajax calls will run one after the other, but I need two different pages as responses, whilst keeping the parent in-tact.
[09:20:34] <Sneedlwoods> i've got a question about jquery:
[09:20:37] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: will push through the fiddle when it's done.
[09:20:42] <Sneedlwoods> <script>
[09:20:42] <Sneedlwoods> $(".ajax_trigger").click(function() {
[09:20:42] <Sneedlwoods> 	$("#success").load("/ajax/ajax-functions.inc.php?fn=createuser", function(response, status, xhr) {
[09:20:42] <Sneedlwoods> 	  if (status == "error") {
[09:20:42] <Sneedlwoods> 		var msg = "Sorry but there was an error: ";
[09:20:43] <Sneedlwoods> 		$("#error").html(msg + xhr.status + " " + xhr.statusText);
[09:20:43] <Sneedlwoods> 	  }
[09:20:44] <Sneedlwoods> 	});
[09:20:44] <Sneedlwoods> 	});
[09:20:45] <Sneedlwoods> </script>
[09:21:04] <Sneedlwoods> this snippet returns an error string "error 0"
[09:21:26] <Sneedlwoods> it doesnt work when i click my button with the class .ajax_trigger
[09:21:37] <Sneedlwoods> someone knows whats wrong? :/
[09:21:51] <c4ptnh00k2> please mock this up in jsfiddle sneedlwoods
[09:22:14] <Sneedlwoods> kk just a minute
[09:24:03] <Sneedlwoods> http://jsfiddle.net/KLuq9/
[09:24:47] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: http://jsfiddle.net/monk3y/eaZZU/ - and it's not meant to be executable, just focussing on the pertinent elements.
[09:29:37] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: the quick solution right now, is to make a button for both, so the user has to explicitly request each report after the other.  Remembering again that I need to keep the parent page intact, and push the submission responses out into a _blank page.  So they'll have to do one after the other.
[09:30:28] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: yes that is the most nieve approach. im working on the better way right now for you
[09:32:13] <Siecje> AdamPDotty http://jsfiddle.net/mwvuH/1/
[09:32:25] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: heh thanks.  I would have said it was the 'kludgiest' ('cause I'd hope it's not naive when you *know* it's crappy), but will await your guidance.
[09:32:53] <maxmoore14> after I set the value of a textarea, is it possible to trigger the browser to auto resize the box?
[09:33:11] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: I'm still thinking it's a browser-limitation on only being able to output to a singleton _blank.
[09:33:24] <EdwardIII> hey, trying to figure out if this would break propagation? i've created a delegate further up the DOM, but it doesn't register clicks on any of the table cells this datepicker generates: https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/blob/master/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js
[09:33:34] <monk3y> maxmoore14: yep .. but do you mean to resize it to fit contents?
[09:33:35] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: I promise you can
[09:33:59] <EdwardIII> this is the relevant bit as far as i can see: https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/blob/master/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js#L671
[09:34:10] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: yeah I thought you could name a target window and always link-out to it/other named targets.  Please don't tell me I have to go iFrames here.
[09:35:21] <Sneedlwoods> Could someone please help me with this snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/KLuq9/#
[09:35:36] <maxmoore14> monk3y: yeah, basically. What I'm saying is, if you type in a textarea in a modern browser, it grows as you type. If I set the text, I'd like to trigger the browser to grow the box.
[09:37:14] <monk3y> Sneedlwoods: I see a few problems with it, but which problem do you see, first?
[09:38:08] <Sneedlwoods> monk3y: i dont understand why the load() functions doesnt start when i click the button.
[09:38:29] <monk3y> maxmoore14: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13085326/resize-text-area-to-fit-all-text-on-load-jquery
[09:38:39] <Siecje> I am trying to make it so that the outside accordion doesn't reset back to a '+' when only the inside one should
[09:38:44] <Siecje> http://jsfiddle.net/mwvuH/2/
[09:39:30] <maxmoore14> monk3y: cool, thx
[09:40:01] <monk3y> Sneedlwoods: what happens to the page and/or console when you click it?
[09:40:41] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: crude and quick but without the whole project a mockup is best I could do. http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/eaZZU/2/
[09:40:45] <monk3y> Sneedlwoods: does the page submit (unintentionally, as I expect it should)?  Could you please console.log the result of the ajax call?  And do the #success and #error elements exist in your page?
[09:42:42] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: thanks so much man.  I understand what you did, and on a quick Google it tells me what window.open will open to default _blank aswell, so let's see if using ajax/submitting in-page will be the difference..
[09:44:43] <Sneedlwoods> monk3y: thanks a lot. i didn't notice that the whole page loaded again when i hit the button element. you know how i can prevent the page from reloading when i click the button element? i won't use an anchor element for the trigger...
[09:45:04] <monk3y> First line of .click() { .. e.preventDefault(); .. }
[09:46:41] <monk3y> Sneedlwoods: preventDefault stops the button from submitting its parent form.  You could also invert the target element; make it an <input type="button">, so it doesn't submit naturally (I believe?)
[09:47:03] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: no prob
[09:47:27] <monk3y> Sneedlwoods: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/290215/difference-between-input-type-button-and-input-type-submit
[09:48:25] <c4ptnh00k2> the prevent default catches the default ACTION of the input.
[09:48:28] <EdwardIII> here's a mockup showing the click not propagation: http://jsfiddle.net/K3v2d/2/
[09:48:37] <Sneedlwoods> monk3y: thanks alot! Now everything's working fine! :)
[09:48:41] <EdwardIII> heh er, click not propagating rather
[09:49:11] * monk3y does a chair-dance
[09:49:15] <EdwardIII> hrm not sure if that updated: http://jsfiddle.net/K3v2d/3/
[09:50:03] <BillCriswell> I find it weird it a <button> is alone in a form it'll act as a submit button but an <input type="button"> won't.
[09:50:10] <BillCriswell> weird if a*
[09:50:41] <c4ptnh00k2> Whats going on Bill
[09:51:07] <BillCriswell> I just expected a <input type="button"> by itself in a form to submit the form like a <button> alone in a form will do.
[09:51:19] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know a dead simple drag/drop upload library? It's for an internal web app that will be used by like 4 people and I just wanna get it done fast.
[09:51:30] <Siecje> so now the inside is working but not the outside http://jsfiddle.net/mwvuH/3/
[09:51:39] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k2: http://jsbin.com/uranun/2/edit example
[09:52:27] <BillCriswell> I find it weird the <button> alone will submit the form, but it's real weird that the other won't work ( to me, at least ).
[09:53:08] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: we successfully have two pages.
[09:53:23] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: glad I could help
[09:53:26] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k2: Nevermind, think this is a misunderstand on my end.
[09:53:29] <BillCriswell> Per usual
[09:53:54] <c4ptnh00k2> BillCriswell: ok I was just about to link you the documentation
[09:53:59] <BillCriswell> haha
[09:54:21] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: unfortunately the data that's come through is garbled for the PDF .. but I'll play with the headers.
[09:54:34] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k2: I got this. 8-)
[09:55:05] <monk3y> (ie. it was working fine before with POSTing the form and PDF coming out .. but now using ajax-tunneling into a new window, it's the raw binary)
[09:55:14] <c4ptnh00k2> BillCriswell: Well then again the reason I was going to send the docs is because you actually read them... most people on here do not.
[09:55:44] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k2: I assumed a <button>'s type attribute would default to "button" and not "submit".
[09:55:48] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k2: Ha, truth.
[09:55:58] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: you could always pass the data through ajax as a json object then rebuild it in the new page.
[09:56:14] <Krambiorix> hi, i want to get an element by classname that is in a sibling iframe... How can i do that?
[09:58:13] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: yeah thought of (and would rather) marshalling it around like that, but looking for quickest POC for the moment.
[10:00:02] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: thinking I might set the content-type of the window? a la; window.open("data:application/pdf"); ?
[10:00:53] <c4ptnh00k2> window.open("data:application/pdf," + escape(pdfString));
[10:02:50] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: you wouldnt happen to be using php would you?
[10:03:33] <stephen_camilo> hi,
[10:03:41] <c4ptnh00k2> hi
[10:03:46] <loopsdeer> Hihi
[10:04:02] <Fallout2man> Hi, have a bit of an odd question only partly related to jQuery. I'm sure you guys had to figure this problem out with jQueryMobile and I'm hoping I could plumb some code wisdom.
[10:04:15] <Fallout2man> Apple Trackpad's and magic mice change the behavior of scrollbars.
[10:04:37] <Fallout2man> Instead of being outside the borders of iFrame content they are rendered inside and the container is stretched.
[10:05:35] <Fallout2man> Is there any way to fix for this with jQuery perhaps? I'm trying to figure out how I can keep the display of iFrames the same even if the trackpad or magic mouse is connected. But have no idea what I'd be able to use to detect that.
[10:06:50] <loopsdeer> Fallout2man: Your problem sounds abysmal. I have no useful suggestion, I just want you to know you have my sympathy for even attempting to solve it.
[10:07:08] <loopsdeer> <3
[10:07:44] <Fallout2man> loopsdeer: danke, heh. I may just try and see if there's some property that gets changed. Possibly in the computed style. I just always like to ask others first before trying to re-invent the wheel myself. ^_^;;
[10:08:02] <loopsdeer> bitte ;) sounds like the right thing to do
[10:09:59] <stephen_camilo> friends
[10:10:12] <stephen_camilo> I did a hover efect
[10:10:42] <stephen_camilo> that should show only the current hoverred div

[10:38:49] <monk3y> c4ptnh00k2: got this working; just submitted the HTML report using your window.open idea, but reverted the PDF report to $(form).submit() - and they both open in their own windows with correctly rendered content.
[10:39:09] <mastodon_agha> hello guys
[10:39:45] <c4ptnh00k2> monk3y: okie dokie.
[10:40:13] <mastodon_agha> I have a few questions about jQuery UI (I asked some of it before under different name yesterday)
[10:40:42] <mastodon_agha> for one is it possible to put buttons vertically instead of horizontaly?
[10:40:55] <loopsdeer> Fallout2man: Nice :-D
[10:41:25] <Fallout2man> in case anyone else has problems, here's the URL to the fix.
[10:41:27] <Fallout2man> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7855590/how-can-i-prevent-scroll-bars-from-being-hidden-for-trackpad-users-in-webkit
[10:42:34] <darkfrog> is there any way to attach a listener to when the width, height, top, or left changes on an element?
[10:44:50] <mastodon_agha> you'd think this place would be more active with 880 people
[10:45:33] <c4ptnh00k2> eh I am at work
[10:46:17] <c4ptnh00k2> hard to pay attention to everything
[10:47:53] <pachet> darkfrog: short answer is no
[10:48:28] <darkfrog> pachet: is something like this my best bet? http://darcyclarke.me/dev/watch/
[10:51:00] <mastodon_agha> okay it seems that horizontal buttons are not supported
[10:52:51] <mastodon_agha> *vertical buttons
[10:53:04] <c4ptnh00k2> wait what? why?
[10:53:44] <c4ptnh00k2> buttons can be styled to be whatever you want them to be
[10:54:00] <c4ptnh00k2> even a mystical unicorn
[10:54:04] <c4ptnh00k2> ...
[10:55:00] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: see this http://jqueryui.com/button/#checkbox
[10:55:18] <mastodon_agha> there is no vertical version of check boxes or radio buttons
[10:55:54] <b-lew> how do you guys force a function? I'm not getting any console errors and i have alerts in my function but they are never getting seen… Part of the hard part is that the function is set on clicking the menu.
[10:56:14] <Ricaz> Is there a simple way of loading just a part of the url of the current page? So if I'm on www.example.com/foo/bar/wat, I would go to www.example.com/foo, dynamically.
[10:56:37] <Ricaz> b-lew, jsFiddle
[10:57:04] <c4ptnh00k2> mastodon_agha:lol i know what a button. What the question is is why do you sau vertical buttons are not supported
[10:57:27] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: well there is no out of the box support
[10:57:44] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: for vertical check boxes
[10:57:52] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: which is weird
[10:58:14] <c4ptnh00k2> mastodon_agha: just stackem lol i guess I dont understand what you want
[10:58:31] <pachet> darkfrog since this is jquery, i'll recommend a ben alman plugin:
[10:58:36] <pachet> !g ben alman jquery resize event
[10:58:36] <b-ot> pachet: Ben Alman » jQuery resize event → http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[10:58:45] <pachet> not sure how well supported it is, but there you are
[10:59:24] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: also what element has the closest functionality to html select? I basically need a menu with scroll bar and stuff
[11:01:18] <c4ptnh00k2> mastodon_agha: It's up to you. Be creative. You can take a list and make it into a menu yada yada or just use a html select element lol
[11:01:50] <DeltaHeavy> mastodon_agha: I usually have to use custom code for <select>s =/
[11:01:56] <darkfrog> pachet: that would only work for size change, not position change, right?
[11:02:00] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: I am not particulary skilled in css (just basics). I am more of a server-side guy
[11:02:02] <c4ptnh00k2> mastodon_agha: literally hundreds of options for options lol
[11:02:19] <c4ptnh00k2> ok
[11:02:24] <c4ptnh00k2> 1 sec then
[11:02:37] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: I know javascript but I rarely do design of a page myself
[11:03:24] <c4ptnh00k2> mastodon_agha: I like this http://jamielottering.github.io/DropKick/
[11:03:35] <pachet> darkfrog probably
[11:03:35] <b-lew> Ricaz: I'm not for sure how to add pages to jsfiddle but here is what I have so far. http://jsfiddle.net/2KtFb/
[11:04:11] <hugo_moss> are there any known devices with resolutions smaller than 320px in width?
[11:04:53] <mastodon_agha> c4ptnh00k2: I like that too
[11:05:17] <Ricaz> b-lew, you don't need the script tags inside the scirpt field
[11:05:20] <pachet> hugo_moss my girlfriend's phone
[11:05:24] <pachet> hugo_moss http://www.nokiasymbianthemes.com/your-phone
[11:05:24] <Ricaz> but I don't see what it is you want to do?
[11:05:46] <b-lew> page transitions.
[11:05:57] <c4ptnh00k2> alrighty guys off to lunch bbiab
[11:06:09] <b-lew> data-ftrans="slide" on click
[11:06:21] <b-lew> so it slides on the page transitions. @Ricaz
[11:06:50] <foghsho> Hello!
[11:07:00] <b-lew> Ricaz:  I'm trying to use this http://www.fasw.ws/faswwp/non-jquery-page-transitions-lightweight/#comment-10640
[11:07:14] <b-lew> whoops that was to my comment. I can repost that link if needed.
[11:14:52] <scar> what is the proper way to detect a change on the value of a textbox?
[11:15:11] <joker_89> I have 3 dependent links, and in each press i consult a database, how can i do i tmore quickly by using jquery and json?
[11:15:16] <joker_89> hi
[11:16:09] <scar> i suppse on change could work
[11:16:13] <scar> seems wrong though :D
[11:16:46] <monk3y> scar: Uh.  Why does onChange seem 'wrong' .. to detect a change . .. ?
[11:17:46] <MarcGuay> Is there a way to get the height of an image if only the width has been set and it's 100%?  .height() returns 0...
[11:20:48] <scar> monk3y, i know that sounds ridiculous... haha, but i was thinking keystrokes perhaps, but onChange seems the best lol. dumbquestions :D
[11:21:57] <hawtin> someone has some time to help me a bit with the first function on the right http://codepen.io/DefMos/pen/ycCBb
[11:22:30] <monk3y> scar: yeah ok, it was just a wierd question.  Anyways, if you want letter-by-letter detection, I believe people prefer onKeyUp (for character-limit checkers, etc).
[11:23:11] <hawtin> I want to make the function to be triggered when someone clicks the + sign. now it is triggered on page load
[11:23:15] <monk3y> scar: onKey*Up* is preferred because you know they've typed something and let the key back up.
[11:23:35] <hawtin> someone?:/
[11:23:59] <hawtin> the first function in the right ( forgot to specify )
[11:24:17] <WebDragon> I see there is matching .eq() to :eq() but no similar .lt() or .gt() to their :lt() :gt() counterparts
[11:24:44] <monk3y> hawtin: change $(function().. to $('#plusSignDiv').click(function() ..
[11:24:51] <monk3y> (or somehting thereabouts)
[11:24:53] <WebDragon> whats the right way to use it such that I can var form = $(some selector) and then form.gt(0).hide()
[11:24:59] <hawtin> that simple ?
[11:25:01] <hawtin> :O
[11:25:03] <hawtin> crazyt
[11:25:41] <WebDragon> I have a series of forms that, if js is enabled, I want to hide all but the first, so I can manipulate just the one form, with jquery
[11:25:46] <scar> will JS ever be replaced?
[11:25:50] <monk3y> hawtin: almost.  Depends on this "plus sign" of yours.  Is it an image?  Or just the '+' character in a big font?  Either way, wrap it in a div and give the div the ID that you're selecting.
[11:25:58] <WebDragon> JS replaced? with what?
[11:26:01] <WebDragon> O-o
[11:26:39] <hawtin> it is an image wrapped in a td
[11:27:01] <monk3y> scar: are you a high-powered Chief Technology Officer asking about talent/skill strategy over the next 5 years .. or are you a n00b that's trying to get out of learning Javascript?
[11:28:03] <monk3y> hawtin: alright, try giving the img element the ID, then select on that.  So; <img id="clickablePlus"..> .. then $('#clickablePlus').on("click",..)
[11:28:18] <scar> monk3y, i'm actually asking based off many articles i've read of people just bashing JS-- was wondering if it's just normal bashing like other languages. And monk3y, for someone as cocky as yourself, you did not provide me an actual option to pick from that fits my scenario. I'm not a n00b at js at all, was just having a brain fart on change/keystroke dynamics for a textbox.
[11:28:43] <monk3y> Heh nah man, I was just having a light joke.  Peace to you and yours.
[11:28:46] <scar> ;)
[11:28:58] <scar> me too hah
[11:29:12] <monk3y> Sure.  Anyways like I said; does onKeyUp look like it should work for you?
[11:29:13] <hawtin> that's what I was doing :/ hope it works
[11:29:18] <EdwardIII> chaps any thoughts on why my click event isn't propagating? http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/7/
[11:29:24] <scar> Seriously though, i was reading up on node.js and they were bashing node and JS in general saying it was going to be faded out
[11:29:33] <scar> monk3y, for this, on('change') worked for me.
[11:29:46] <scar> it just, for some reason, seemed wrong (i was thinking bc i used it on dropdowns, etc)
[11:30:21] <EdwardIII> i don't see anything in the datepicker script that would cause it to stop propagation: https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/blob/master/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js#L671
[11:30:22] <scar> EdwardIII, try on('click', function())
[11:30:53] <EdwardIII> scar: but i'm looking to use a delegate because the contents of that div is mutated by the datepicker
[11:31:08] <monk3y> EdwardIII: shouldn't the 'td' and 'click' be the other way around?
[11:31:20] <scar> EdwardIII, when the contents get edited, you need to provide your JS in the callback to apply the js to the new elements
[11:31:28] <monk3y> (.on(events, selector..))
[11:31:51] <scar> monk3y, that is a valid question: what is the best method of applying JS to newly created items by say ajax or something dropping html in. the best method i found was for example adding my JS to the ajax callback
[11:32:47] <monk3y> It's just making sure all new elements have the right IDs or classes added to them, then define the bindings to listen for events on those IDs/classes.
[11:32:50] <EdwardIII> monk3y: don't think so, $("#dataTable tbody").on("click", "tr", function(event){
[11:33:05] <EdwardIII> monk3y: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:33:13] <EdwardIII> monk3y: .delegate had the args the other way around, perhaps you're thinking of that?
[11:33:23] <monk3y> EdwardIII: sorry man, I may be looking at an old version of your fiddle: I've got - $('#dates').on('td', 'click', function(){
[11:33:23] <EdwardIII> scar: the plugin author didn't provide hooks for those callbacks to be placed in
[11:33:50] <monk3y> EdwardIII: (http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/7/)
[11:34:00] <scar> EdwardIII, i just know that to apply JS to new items after the dom is loaded, you need to call the JS after the JS that creates it
[11:34:32] <EdwardIII> scar: the bonus with using delegated events is that you don't to call the js after the JS that creates it, they're awesome
[11:34:56] <scar> EdwardIII, where are you usng delegated events?
[11:35:07] <EdwardIII> monk3y: ah, my, earlier, mistake heh: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/8/
[11:35:30] <EdwardIII> scar: line 5
[11:36:38] <scar> EdwardIII, don't see how that's delegated. is it delegated bc of .on() ? i'm not familiar with delegated events
[11:37:07] <EdwardIII> scar: it's delegated because of the selector in .on, 1 sec, lemme show you why it's awesome
[11:37:10] <EdwardIII> (when it works)
[11:37:40] <scar> EdwardIII, i use .on() all of the time, and i always have to place my JS in my ajax callbacks
[11:38:10] <EdwardIII> i'm about to change your life
[11:38:19] <scar> :D
[11:38:26] <scar> i've asked this many times, and just gave up lol
[11:38:37] <scar> EdwardIII, does it work with ajax-created content?
[11:39:03] <monk3y> It's also good for defining bindings for elements that may not be 'there' yet (like you were asking, scar); you can define the bind on page load, then load new elements in, and the bindings are ready to go.
[11:39:31] <monk3y> scar: it works on anything in the dom.  So as long as you've loaded-in the ajax stuff and attached it somewhere, and it matches your binding selectors, you're good.
[11:39:36] <EdwardIII> scar: check this: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/btJbj/
[11:40:01] <EdwardIII> if you add a new cartoon character, then click it, that alert event is still bound
[11:40:26] <EdwardIII> when you click any of the lis in that list, that event bubbles up to the ul, then the containing tag all the way up to <body>
[11:40:59] <monk3y> I haven't used jsFiddle much; does it gag alert() calls automatically?
[11:41:07] <EdwardIII> so you can put the listener on the ul, get it to listen out for lis. this means any new lis will still have the same event. dead handy when you've got a massive table with <tr>s getting moved around, shifted, and added
[11:41:24] <EdwardIII> monk3y: hmm no, and it works ok here
[11:42:03] <EdwardIII> version without alerts: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/btJbj/2/
[11:42:05] <not_mike> cork, you still in here?
[11:42:41] <monk3y> EdwardIII: oh it works as intended .. I just don't get the alerts() I've seen you put through your examples.  I changed some of them to console.log()s .. and they don't show up either.  :(
[11:43:33] <EdwardIII> monk3y: oh in my datepicker you mean?
[11:44:12] <scar> EdwardIII, monk3y is the key here using 3 parameters for on() instead of 2 ?
[11:44:25] <EdwardIII> scar: yeah exactly
[11:44:26] <monk3y> EdwardIII: heh yeah.. am I looking at old code again? :)
[11:44:44] <EdwardIII> monk3y: no that's exactly right, that's the problem - i can't figure out why the clicks aren't propagating
[11:44:52] <EdwardIII> i've simplified it even further: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/9/
[11:45:03] <scar> and you do on('click', 'li' -- can 'li' be any selector as normal, or must be child of $('.foo').on('click', 'li', func()) -- child of .foo ?
[11:45:08] <monk3y> scar: yeah, it's really flexible and efficient for really dynamic pages.  I mean if you just have a static page that doesn't change the dom at all .. then you can just use .on('click', function() and that's it.
[11:45:26] <scar> pisses me off bc i'm using .on() this whole time, never knowing of the mddle parameter
[11:45:26] <scar> heh
[11:45:28] <EdwardIII> scar: it can be any selector, but it does need to be a child of .foo, that's how it works
[11:45:39] <EdwardIII> the event bubbles up to the parent element
[11:45:40] <scar> i imagiend so but was just making sure
[11:45:50] <scar> you may have saved my life, EdwardIII
[11:45:55] <EdwardIII> you can, in a pinch, put an event listener on body that way
[11:45:59] <scar> i dont care what they say about you in twilight
[11:46:06] <EdwardIII> but i don't know what the performance penalty would be for that
[11:46:16] <scar> yeah i imagine the more specific the better
[11:46:22] <EdwardIII> yeah i didn't know how to use delegated events for a long time
[11:46:32] <scar> i place everything inside jQuery(document).ready(function($) {});
[11:46:35] <EdwardIII> wish someone had shown me that on day 2 or 3, would have saved me hours of DOM listening pain heh
[11:46:39] <scar> i imagine that will still work, EdwardIII  ?
[11:46:44] <monk3y> scar: what's really going to blow your noodle, is mixing-in promises..
[11:46:46] <EdwardIII> yeah you still need that
[11:46:46] <scar> EdwardIII, i wish you told me this 3 years ago hah
[11:46:54] <scar> mixing in promises?
[11:47:07] <EdwardIII> the event you're putting the listener on still has to exist and be loaded ok
[11:47:11] * scar has a meeting to be at in just a minute, so i hope yall will be here ;)
[11:47:20] <EdwardIII> e.g. .foo in your example above
[11:47:26] <scar> yeah so the parent must be there always
[11:47:28] <monk3y> jQuery promises/delegation/when etc.  Google it/look it up in jQuery docs .. powerful, but relatively mind-bending stuff.
[11:47:29] <EdwardIII> yeah
[11:47:34] <scar> hence body if absolutely necessary
[11:47:37] <EdwardIII> sure
[11:47:53] <scar> .delegate() and .undelegate() ?
[11:48:01] <scar> monk3y,  ^^ ?
[11:48:13] <Stephen> Yeah
[11:48:13] <EdwardIII> .delegate is old, the 3-argument version of .on replaces that
[11:48:18] <scar> ahh
[11:48:21] <Stephen> just use .on
[11:48:33] <Stephen> and scope it responsibly
[11:48:36] <RandomCouch> Does anyone know about video.js?
[11:48:39] <scar> well i am going to be comign back in a bit. i hope to continue this discussion ;) thank you call
[11:48:42] <arronhunt> Hey guys, how do I scroll a div all the way to the left or right?
[11:49:06] <RandomCouch> I'm not sure if this is jQuery related but I have a plugin that uses video.js, and actually every plugin that uses video.js that I've tried, turns my background color to white...
[11:49:08] <RandomCouch> WHY?
[11:49:21] <EdwardIII> heh
[11:49:31] <Stephen> arronhunt: div.scrollLeft(div.scrollMaxX) or div.scrollLeft(0)
[11:49:37] <EdwardIII> RandomCouch: can you pastebin an example?
[11:49:43] <RandomCouch> I've been struggling with this for a while now and I'm on a tight scheduel.. Such a lame problem to have -.-
[11:49:43] <EdwardIII> RandomCouch: jsfiddle rather
[11:49:47] <arronhunt> Stephen perfect thank you :)
[11:49:52] <Stephen> arronhunt: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/css_scrollleft.asp
[11:50:13] <RandomCouch> EdwardIII What do you need me to paste exactly?
[11:50:20] <Stephen> RandomCouch: YOu mean the bg color of the video or the site?
[11:50:26] <EdwardIII> RandomCouch: an example of the video tag changing the background colour to white
[11:50:28] <RandomCouch> stephanie_ the site
[11:50:31] <RandomCouch> Stephen The site
[11:50:37] <RandomCouch> EdwardIII okay one sec
[11:50:49] <stephanie_> oh not me.
[11:50:54] <RandomCouch> http://scienceauto.myftp.org/wordpress/ (This website is hosted locally so it loads really slow)
[11:50:58] <Stephen> Only way a video changes the site's bg is if it's fullscreen
[11:51:06] <RandomCouch> and it has a video in there, turns my background white
[11:51:19] <Stephen> BG is not white
[11:51:23] <RandomCouch> http://testsa.redirectme.net/wordpress/forum/ this is the website functionning normally without any white bg
[11:51:27] <Stephen> RandomCouch, BG is black
[11:51:40] <EdwardIII> Stephen: you seem fairly on top of things, any idea why click events aren't bubbling up here? http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/10/
[11:51:41] <RandomCouch> Stephen what? ... how can that be.. it's clearly white to me
[11:51:53] <EdwardIII> i don't see any reasons for it here: https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/blob/master/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js#L671
[11:51:56] <Stephen> RandomCouch: Video driver issues
[11:51:56] <EdwardIII> RandomCouch: which browser?
[11:52:29] <RandomCouch> EdwardIII I'm using chrome, also my friend who is next to me loaded the website and it also shows up as white
[11:52:39] <RandomCouch> Stephen Can't be... Test it on more than one pc
[11:52:44] <RandomCouch> tested *
[11:52:48] <Stephen> Edward: there is no TD element
[11:53:04] <EdwardIII> Stephen: is this zen? like there is no spoon?
[11:53:14] <Stephen> RandomCouch: Are you talking about the video's border? Because your BG on the site is black
[11:53:26] <RandomCouch> Stephen what browser are you using?
[11:53:32] <RandomCouch> This is weird
[11:53:37] <Stephen> Chrome, but I have FF and IE as well
[11:53:44] <hawtin> monk3y Idk if you're still here.. I've tried that and several other methods from google and I know it should work.. but it doesn't :/
[11:53:48] <RandomCouch> :/ why does it show white for me and my friends
[11:53:56] <EdwardIII> shows grey gradient here
[11:53:58] <EdwardIII> but i don't see a video?
[11:54:04] <RandomCouch> It's in the latest posts
[11:54:06] <RandomCouch> Redneck video 1
[11:54:08] <RandomCouch> should be a vidceo
[11:54:15] <RandomCouch> well the thumbnail should be a video
[11:55:17] <Stephen> RandomCouch: http://i44.tinypic.com/30cvk88.jpg
[11:55:17] <EdwardIII> don't see latest posts?
[11:55:19] <Stephen> Looks fine
[11:55:47] <Stephen> RandomCouch: Could be the image used on the BG is blocked where you are?
[11:55:53] <EdwardIII> ah yeah wrong link
[11:56:02] <EdwardIII> yeah i see grey/black bg too
[11:56:08] <RandomCouch> Wow...
[11:56:15] <RandomCouch> Well that's really weird
[11:56:16] <RandomCouch> thanks guys
[11:56:17] <EdwardIII> chrome on linux/windows both show the same thing
[11:56:22] <RandomCouch> I'm glad it looks okay on your end
[11:56:24] <EdwardIII> ahhh wait
[11:56:36] <RandomCouch> I have no idea why it wouldn't be okay on my end
[11:56:39] <EdwardIII> chrome on windows shows a white bg
[11:56:44] <EdwardIII> chrome on linux shows a grey/black bg
[11:56:52] <EdwardIII> that is pretty sucky
[11:56:59] <RandomCouch> lol
[11:57:06] <RandomCouch> ugh, I hate web development
[11:57:11] <EdwardIII> RandomCouch: i'm seeing a lot of errors under the console
[11:57:30] <RandomCouch> EdwardIII Yeah I saw those too... they all came from wordpress plugins I've downloaded
[11:57:36] <EdwardIII> hmmm
[11:57:43] <RandomCouch> cause, you know... wordpress is full of broken plugins
[11:58:33] <RandomCouch> I've had so many struggles with wordpress plugins.. like that one time with an event calendar plugin... Got me so frustrated :|
[11:58:38] <EdwardIII> Stephen: what did you mean by your comment about there being no tds?
[12:01:12] <hawtin> http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/rSdft/ can someone have a look at this function and tell me if something's wrong cause I can't get it to work :/
[12:01:17] <Stephen> EdwardIII: .on("click","td".... expects your element to be the child of a td
[12:01:40] <Stephen> the second param is a parent, not a child
[12:02:29] <hawtin> :/ I kinda have the same problem
[12:02:37] <EdwardIII> Stephen: i'm not sure that's right? http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:03:51] <sunbeam> hi, does anyone know how $.post can alert the result the return "something"; of a PHP script?
[12:03:57] <Stephen> Yeah, Im wrong
[12:04:03] <Stephen> sorry, got that backwards
[12:04:11] <Stephen> Anyway, there are no child td's
[12:04:21] <Stephen> Now, if you are attempting to trap TD's in the datepicker
[12:04:37] <EdwardIII> Stephen: i don't get why you keep saying there are no tds?
[12:04:40] <Stephen> Break out your firebug or DOM Inspector
[12:04:41] <EdwardIII> Stephen: i can see TDs
[12:04:59] <Stephen> I'm betting the calendar element doesn't get created inside the date element
[12:05:18] <Stephen> Calendars classically get created higher up in the DOM
[12:05:27] <EdwardIII> Stephen: seems to be: //*[@id="dates"]/div/div[1]/table/tbody/tr[1]/td[4]
[12:05:33] <Stephen> Can you link me to an example of it broken?
[12:05:47] <drager> Should I be using if request.POST.in_key('value') instead of request.POST.has_key('value') ?
[12:06:05] <Stephen> sunbeam: sure, have the PHP script return JSON
[12:06:07] <drager> woops, wrong channel
[12:06:11] <EdwardIII> sorry i don't understand - it's broken in the jsfiddle for me, calendar renders ok but the click event never fires, is it not the same for you?
[12:06:25] <Stephen> Ok, the calendar doesn't work in the fiddle
[12:06:25] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/10/
[12:06:32] <Stephen> Because it doesn't have jQueryUI
[12:06:45] <EdwardIII> it doesn't need jquery UI, it uses bootstrap
[12:07:06] <EdwardIII> if you click the back and forwards buttons you should see it cycling through the dates
[12:07:12] <Stephen> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'datepicker'
[12:07:36] <EdwardIII> hmm, i don't see that here?
[12:07:42] <MarcGuay> $(window).scroll() gets fired after a scrollTop animation is completed if there is still some space to be scrolled.  Any idea why this is or what can be done to stop it?   http://jsfiddle.net/375kC/
[12:07:45] <Stephen> Nope, turn on your console
[12:07:49] <EdwardIII> it's on
[12:07:54] <Stephen> Edward: What browser are you on?
[12:08:05] <EdwardIII> chrome 26
[12:08:17] <EdwardIII> you're definition using the fiddle above, not an older version?
[12:08:20] <Stephen> Refused to execute script from 'https://raw.github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker/master/js/bootstrap-datepicker.js' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[12:08:24] <EdwardIII> definition/definitely?
[12:08:45] <snover> delete the dot between raw and github
[12:08:57] <sunbeam> Stephen: how can I return false in json?
[12:09:13] <EdwardIII> Stephen: ah ok, how come you're seeing that strict mime type checking?
[12:09:16] <Stephen> sunbeam: { "returnval" : false }
[12:09:29] <sunbeam> in PHP?
[12:09:41] <EdwardIII> i'll pop it up on a webserver instead of using github
[12:09:42] <Stephen> sunbeam: Go read on how to return JSON in PHP

[12:11:06] <sunbeam> Stephen: http://pastebin.com/fWcGBYRD
[12:11:18] <sunbeam> where do I fill hasContracts ?
[12:11:20] <hawtin> anyone has 1 min to help out here http://codepen.io/DefMos/pen/ycCBb why doesn't clicking on the tr doesn't trigger the first function in the right ?
[12:11:21] <hawtin> :/
[12:12:13] <Stephen> sunbeam: hasContracts is a param on a callback, it will be auto-filled inside the $.post method with the results of the post. You need to read on jquery's site about $.ajax
[12:12:57] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Switching to FF, I can see the calendar there
[12:13:02] <sunbeam> Stephen: but isn't hasContracts the result of the PHP script I am calling?
[12:13:28] <EdwardIII> Stephen: i've updated it so it'll work with your strict mime type checking: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/12/

[12:16:24] <EdwardIII> and here's a version with a sans-serif font: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/13/
[12:17:36] <c4ptnh00k2> Just wondering if anyone here is familiar with jqgrid and entity framework. How do you sort asce and desc?
[12:22:33] <sunbeam> Stephen: ok sorry the other day people were recommending me to NOT use $.ajax but always use $.post
[12:23:21] <Stephen> sunbeam: They are the same thing
[12:23:27] <Stephen> You just need to understand how it works
[12:23:40] <sunbeam> you return something with PHP right?
[12:24:03] <Stephen> ...
[12:24:10] <Stephen> Can someone else help sunbeam
[12:24:28] <Stephen> sunbeam: Im afraid you may lack a fundamental understanding of the tech you are using
[12:24:33] <Stephen> PHP returns text
[12:24:39] <Stephen> just format that text as JSON
[12:24:48] <Stephen> give it the right content type
[12:24:56] <Stephen> and javascript will read it
[12:25:13] <Stephen> jquery does so using the $.ajax, $.get, or $.post commands
[12:25:35] <sunbeam> Stephen: I did
[12:25:40] <Stephen> Please read the docs for each language to understand. They are very short
[12:26:06] <Stephen> But, basically, $.ajax, $.get, $.post use callbacks to route the return data
[12:26:19] <Stephen> That's why you are seeing functions with parameters you can't fill
[12:26:42] <Stephen> One function is calling the next and filling what it retrieved into that param
[12:26:57] <Stephen> lol: c4ptnh00k2: Doing that exact stuff now
[12:27:15] <Stephen> EdwardIII: You are right, the TD's aren't triggering the event
[12:27:53] <Stephen> EdwardIII: if I remove the decendent filter, then check the event for the sourceElement, it does show as the TD though
[12:27:56] <Stephen> so I don't understand
[12:28:02] <Stephen> I think you found a bug
[12:28:15] <Stephen> But, note that you are using jQuery 2.0 (edge)
[12:28:23] <Stephen> You  might want to try an earlier version first
[12:28:57] <c4ptnh00k2> Stephen: So do you know how?
[12:29:18] <EdwardIII> hmm that sucks
[12:29:36] <EdwardIII> any thoughts on how i can workaround?
[12:29:59] <EdwardIII> just remove the descendent filter, and run if (sourceElement == td) { ...?
[12:30:24] <dumbdell> is there a way to see what errors might of happened from .css()
[12:30:41] <Stephen> EdwardIII: I think I found it
[12:30:48] <Stephen> There's another event handler there
[12:31:15] <Stephen> It's stopping the propagation before it gets to yours
[12:31:41] <Stephen> basically, the calendar is already doing what you are doing, and preventing further event detection
[12:31:55] <sunbeam> Stephen: I return json_encode("none"). When I console.log() hasContracts it says "none" , but still if(hasContracts == "none") is not true
[12:31:58] <sunbeam> any idea how come?
[12:32:12] <guideX> any reason why $("a").live("click", function(){ alert("HEY"); });   isn't finding    <a tabindex="1" class="vehicle1_model" href="#" data-item="BLAH">BLAH</a>
[12:32:21] <guideX> dynamically added also..
[12:32:47] <Stephen> sunbeam: It doesn't interpret the JSON as code
[12:32:47] <Stephen> ot'
[12:32:50] <Stephen> it's text
[12:32:58] <EdwardIII> Stephen: i had a flick through the source but couldn't figure out exactly how the click event was getting bound
[12:33:22] <sunbeam> Stephen: so how can i convert it?
[12:33:26] <sunbeam> so i can compare it
[12:33:32] <Stephen> in this case, sounds like just a "none" string. Javascript can't interpret that. Read up on Javascript's JSON.parse method. The data returned from PHP needs to be fed through that
[12:33:49] <EdwardIII> Stephen: is there a way i can patch it to allow delegation back up the DOM?
[12:34:36] <Stephen> EdwardIII: You'll have to modify their code to attach your events before theirs.
[12:35:00] <stephen_camilo> Hi
[12:35:07] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Actually...
[12:35:16] <EdwardIII> Stephen: perhaps just add a callback to the options and include it in their click method/
[12:35:47] <darkfrog> is there a good framework for undo / redo functionality?
[12:35:50] <stephen_camilo> how can i resize the jquery cycle image?
[12:35:55] <Stephen> EdwardIII: you'll have to step back from jQuery. get the raw onclick value, and add a reference to your script in the first line of the function
[12:36:16] <Stephen> EdwardIII: If they offer it, I would say yes
[12:36:21] <EdwardIII> they don't
[12:36:26] <EdwardIII> but i could fork, patch and submit a pull request
[12:36:43] <Stephen> This is bootstrap?
[12:36:55] <EdwardIII> it's a 3rd party bootstrap plugin
[12:37:07] <sunbeam> Stephen: so I should parse hasContracts ?
[12:37:11] <sunbeam> that is returned
[12:37:24] <dumbdell> is there a way to see what errors might of happened from .css()
[12:37:32] <Stephen> Yeah, mod the plugin to call a function in their event handler which is sourced from a parameter
[12:37:34] <Stephen> Best way
[12:37:55] <Stephen> sunbeam: You still didn't read or you'd know this
[12:38:00] <EdwardIII> not sure i see what you mean by your raw onclick comment though?
[12:38:14] <Stephen> sunbeam: that function actually has 3 parameters which can be fed to it
[12:38:23] <EdwardIII> heh they've got 52 outstanding pull requests, liklihood of them accepting mine seems slim
[12:38:29] <Stephen> Find the one that is the responseText and parse it with JSON.parse
[12:39:07] <Stephen> EdwardIII: It's ugly, but do you remember how you attached additional event handlers onto an element before jquery?
[12:39:26] <Stephen> element.onclick += somefunction;
[12:39:28] <sunbeam> Stephen: ok
[12:39:29] <EdwardIII> yeah
[12:39:40] <sunbeam> Stephen: so i should have 3 values in function() ?
[12:39:46] <sunbeam> in the return function?
[12:39:48] <EdwardIII> i remember it with great affection
[12:40:18] <Stephen> var mod = element.onclick.toString(); element.onclick = functiontoparsetextandaddalinetothebeginning(mod);
[12:41:05] <Stephen> sunbeam: you can, you don't have to
[12:41:08] <EdwardIII> hrm but as the elements in the datepicker are blinking in and out of existence frequently that would cause problems, unless i could combine that with event delegation?
[12:41:23] <Stephen> sunbeam: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[12:41:47] <Stephen> Read right there, it shows how to do exactly what you are asing
[12:41:49] <Stephen> asking
[12:42:28] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Yes, it would. You might try getting a child element of #dates by a level or two
[12:42:29] <EdwardIII> heh i'm assing all over the place
[12:42:35] <Stephen> It seems they hook to #dates as weoll
[12:42:36] <Stephen> well
[12:43:33] <Stephen> $("#dates .datepicker-days").on("click","td"....
[12:43:52] <Stephen> Hah!
[12:43:55] <Stephen> That worked
[12:44:14] <Stephen> EdwardIII:L http://jsfiddle.net/K3v2d/16/
[12:44:17] <scar> back :D
[12:44:19] <Stephen> EdwardIII
[12:44:50] <sunbeam> Stephen: Example: Alert the results from requesting test.php (HTML or XML, depending on what was returned).
[12:44:54] <shadyKha_> can someone explain how this code works? http://jsfiddle.net/ccUB9/
[12:44:55] <sunbeam> look at this, I think I am doing it good now
[12:44:59] <EdwardIII> Stephen: it kinda works but it does cause issues, sort of defeats the point of delegation, e.g. if i move the arguments around it breaks: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/17/
[12:45:17] <shadyKha_> mostly line 4
[12:45:28] <Stephen> For future reference, when investigating event handler stacking like this for jQuery, look on the event object & at the element's  _secondaryEvents property
[12:46:03] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Are you trying to replicate the behavior of .live()?
[12:46:19] <Stephen> Because the only difference is that .live() was a hook on the top level document
[12:46:25] <EdwardIII> Stephen: introduces the same problem as the ordinary click does: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/K3v2d/18/ # works with the click but isn't going to work if it's called before the datepicker is initialised
[12:46:36] <EdwardIII> Stephen: not trying, just trying to do normal event delegation
[12:47:02] <EdwardIII> although perhaps i could use live as a temporary workaround? you can't stop events from being hit on live, can you?
[12:47:13] <Stephen> My solution hooks to an element created by the .datepicker() method
[12:47:27] <EdwardIII> that's what i'm trying to avoid
[12:47:52] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Is it out of the question to wrap the .datepicker() method?
[12:48:02] <EdwardIII> not out of the question, no
[12:48:14] <EdwardIII> i'm just looking for a nice way to get it working heh
[12:48:16] <Stephen> They plugin is stoping event delegation of td at the #dates level
[12:48:22] <Stephen> actually, at the TD level
[12:48:26] <EdwardIII> yeah
[12:48:27] <Stephen> Nothing you can do there
[12:48:56] <EdwardIII> although going back to that i can't be the only person that's had this problem right? how come their hooking into the click event at td level breaks dom bubbling?
[12:49:05] <EdwardIII> well, breaks/prevents
[12:49:22] <tbranyen> is it possible to know, in 1.9.1, what events are bound to a given element?
[12:49:27] <Stephen> But, you could queue up your event handlers and add them in a wrapper to .datepicker() after calling datepicker()
[12:49:56] <Stephen> EdwardIII: They've basically done a .on("#dates"
[12:50:15] <EdwardIII> how come jquery can't bind two .on('#dates though?
[12:50:17] <Stephen> EdwardIII: They've basically done a .on("#dates","td", function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[12:50:26] <EdwardIII> oh
[12:50:32] <EdwardIII> i don't actually see e.stopProp... anywhere though?
[12:50:53] <Stephen> There are two other event handlers stacked above yours each time a td is clicked
[12:51:12] <Stephen> One of those two handlers is stopping you
[12:51:25] <EdwardIII> 2 handlers?
[12:52:10] <Stephen> Oh, shit
[12:52:16] <Stephen> they are using proxies
[12:52:54] <Stephen> e.preventDefault();
[12:53:01] <Stephen> That's what they are using
[12:53:16] <EdwardIII> but i didn't think preventDefault stopped propagation?
[13:01:54] <shoky> tbranyen: undocumented way..  $._data(element, 'events')
[13:02:04] <Stephen> EdwardIII: It's the way they are using Proxys
[13:02:08] <tbranyen> shoky: isn't work
[13:02:10] <tbranyen> ing
[13:02:12] <Stephen> in jquery-git2.js
[13:02:16] <tbranyen> shoky: pretty sure thats 1.8 only
[13:02:20] <shoky> tbranyen: works for me
[13:02:22] <tbranyen> weird
[13:02:26] <tbranyen> must be something on my end, thx
[13:02:27] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm trying to add dropzone.js's functionality to a form that's loaded after the DOM is ready. Anybody know how I should go about this?
[13:03:06] <EdwardIII> Stephen: i've actually never used a proxy, how would that break it?
[13:03:49] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Proxys are strange beasts. They construct pass through function structures that override everything else
[13:03:57] <Stephen> Think of them like a method override
[13:04:30] <EdwardIII> they don't have anything to do with the OO concept of a proxy object then?
[13:04:42] <Stephen> They are the piece of javascript needed to add read getters and setters to objects
[13:05:28] <Stephen> Here is mozilla's explaination of them
[13:05:29] <Stephen> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FProxy
[13:05:38] <EdwardIII> does all this just reiterate the need for this to be done by an event in the code rather than using event prop.?
[13:05:41] <lolmaus> I've found a bug in jQuery. O-o
[13:05:45] <Stephen> What you are dealing with is jQuery's approximation of them
[13:06:31] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Basically, the developer would have done this because of all the creating/destroying of DOM nodes they are doing
[13:06:35] <lolmaus> Can someone please tell whether what i found is a bug or not? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13956
[13:06:37] <scar> datepicker won't open back up on close by esc
[13:06:41] <scar> any ideas why? lol
[13:06:44] <Stephen> Events can leak quickly in these setups
[13:07:06] <Stephen> scar: The ESC method needs to reattach the event
[13:08:26] <scar> Stephen, so on key press if key is ESC key, then re-attach event?
[13:10:16] <EdwardIII> Stephen: my understanding is that proxy in jquery is used to change `this`, the context object, kinda like .call or .apply, how come this breaks event prop?
[13:10:33] <slide> Does anyone know how to get JSON.stringify to work on $('html') ? I need to pass the entire page to my backend
[13:10:49] <slide> instead i get 'Converting circular structure to JSON'
[13:13:54] <slide> hrm doesnt even really need to be json, just need the page source as an escaped string
[13:15:17] <EdwardIII> just trying to get my head around this events building thing they have
[13:15:36] <EdwardIII> it's not what i'm used to, not sure where i'd put the click callback...
[13:16:41] <BillCriswell> slide: $('html').text() ?
[13:16:49] <BillCriswell> Er, wait lol
[13:16:51] <BillCriswell> .html()?
[13:22:20] <slide> BillCriswell, yea i've got the html, just making it so it can be read it
[13:22:31] <slide> if i just output it as is, i get an error beacuse it spans multiple lines
[13:22:49] <slide> so now Ive got to add a \ to the end of each line i think
[13:22:57] <BillCriswell> that seems weird.
[13:27:47] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Feed them through th Datepicker constructor "options" param
[13:27:59] <Stephen> safest way to introduce them
[13:28:04] <Stephen> As for where to hook
[13:30:09] <BillCriswell> slide: I just tried $.post('test.php', { html: $('html').html() }, function(result){ console.log( result.html ); }); with <?php echo json_encode($_POST); ?> and was absle to get the html without escaping anything.
[13:34:46] <slide> hrm
[13:34:53] <slide> oh right
[13:35:19] <slide> because im not actually sending it via a post
[13:35:29] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Ok, so more research done
[13:35:37] <slide> essentially, i need the method that post is using to properly escape the html into the json
[13:35:44] <Stephen> Look at line 713 of jquery-git2.js
[13:35:48] <c4ptnh00k2> Stephen: Dont worry about it. I figured it out... lol even though it seems you forgot about me. lol
[13:35:49] <Stephen> This is the proxy code
[13:36:08] <Stephen> c4ptnh00k2: Sorry, keeping busy today
[13:36:22] <c4ptnh00k2> understandable
[13:36:38] <Stephen> What were you working on with jqgrid and EF?
[13:37:24] <c4ptnh00k2> how to sort a jqgrid where the rows were from an entity
[13:37:32] <Stephen> EdwardIII: Basically what the calendar has done is create a jquery proxy (a permenantly scoped method call) and made the event handler that object
[13:37:51] <Stephen> So event if you attach other handlers, the proxy only calls what was in that original scope
[13:37:56] <Stephen> And I'm done with that
[13:44:19] <BillCriswell> slide: I'm not sure if you can can serializeArray() directly on on object. I'd need to look it up.
[13:45:03] <sunbeam> a site like http://www.poorfi.com/

[13:45:08] <sunbeam> How come?
[13:46:10] <Zapy> works here in ff
[13:46:20] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody have any experience with dropzone.js?
[13:48:49] <BillCriswell> slide: Could be as simple as $.parseJSON({"html":whatever});
[13:49:06] <diverdude> Anybody knows a library for questionaires?
[13:51:39] <slide> i kinda went another way which i didnt have luck with before
[13:51:43] <slide> for some reason now its working.. heh
[13:51:51] <slide> but I have a new problem
[13:52:03] * dumbdell throws a pie at the wall
[13:53:31] * dumbdell plays a distorted failed tune on his trumbone
[13:53:47] <slide> I have an div that is covering an iframe, unfortunately also its scrollbar so I cant scroll the iframe
[13:53:53] <slide> not sure how to pass JUST that even through
[13:56:38] <sunbeam> Zapy: maybe I am missing a plugin?
[14:00:49] <dumbdell> http://fiddle.jshell.net/img/initializing.png
[14:01:02] <DeltaHeavy>  Anybody know a drag/drop upload JS library that doesn't suck, and isn't gigantic in terms of width/height?
[14:01:48] <not_mike> could a create a div with javascript?
[14:01:51] <not_mike> brb, google
[14:01:55] <dumbdell> native html5 / and pritty minimal javascript gets that job quiet elegantly why do you need a library?
[14:01:58] <NoiseEee> DeltaHeavy: can't you just make 'gigantic' 'small' via css?

[14:28:10] <diverdude> Why would one want to use jquery 2.0 when ie<8 is not supported
[14:28:19] <snover> if you have to ask…
[14:28:47] <diverdude> i mean what good does it bring?
[14:28:52] <dumbdell> lol
[14:29:07] <diverdude> which makes it worth it
[14:29:17] <diverdude> compared to just using 1.x
[14:29:58] <WebDragon> so 2.x supports IE8 and up?
[14:30:18] <WebDragon> (haven't been paying attention lately. mired in SQL and DBIx::Class and PDO
[14:30:41] <diverdude> WebDragon, i believe so yes
[14:31:10] <BillCriswell> diverdude: It's about 10% smaller.
[14:31:10] <dumbdell> the good it will bring.. giving the developer and extreme satisfacation of knowing that IE 6-8 is basically obselete legacy poop and they do not need to care about it any longer
[14:31:10] <diverdude> WebDragon, i dont know why they wanted that :) Seems like there are really no perks for using v2 hehe
[14:31:45] <diverdude> dumbdell, well it still is if you use 1.x and you just support it better anyway
[14:31:56] <diverdude> dumbdell, with no extra work
[14:32:35] <dumbdell> i found out about about this today on a similar note
[14:32:36] <dumbdell> http://css3pie.com/
[14:36:10] <dumbdell> but surely if there are any bugs in 1.x like mem leaks then 2.x will be better to use anyway surely no point being more compatible but driving in that broken left hand lane
[14:36:56] <jedimind> WebDragon:  to answer your question from earlier
[14:37:09] <jedimind> jquery 2.* only supports IE10 and forward
[14:43:15] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/DHxU2/39/ <--running on the gpu now :) ... and Cork if your here i found the problem trying to use $.prefixes and .css({});  .... because $.prefix.animation returns "webkitAnimation" rather then --webkit-animation ??
[14:50:59] <h3nryturk> Anyone know a fix for the beforeFind array_key_exists notices?

[14:53:12] <h3nryturk> wups, wrong channel
[14:58:38] <dumbdell> http://davidwalsh.name/vendor-prefix <-- now that makes life easier!
[15:03:02] <shoky> not_mike: you edit the width by changing its css.  e.g. iDiv.style.width = '150px';  or $(iDiv).css({width:150})
[15:03:30] <not_mike> shoky, thankyou, trying that now
[15:03:46] <shoky> not_mike: it's easier to use jquery for all that stuff you're doing, btw
[15:04:06] <not_mike> I don't know how to use js, let alone jquery
[15:04:14] <not_mike> I got this jsfiddle from stackoverflow

[15:34:56] <_Cody> grainy would be nice
[15:35:20] <_Cody> I am sure there must be an effect like this, but i didnt find it so far
[15:35:32] <Synthead> how can I close a bootstrap modal with jQuery?  essentially replicating data-dismiss="modal"
[15:35:43] <mmlac-bv> any reason this does not work as expected?  (element has skipBtn class triggers)      $('a').on ("click", ".skipBtn", function(e){ alert("afsdfs") });
[15:36:05] <mmlac-bv> without the selector it works. Do I need to use [class=skipBtn]?
[15:36:28] <RohanBhangui> _Cody: NOT something lik this right? http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/JYxbN/
[15:37:22] <Zzaichik> target a parent element in the first selector    $('.parent').on('click', '.skipBtn', function(e) {
[15:37:43] <mmlac-bv> oh that makes sense. Thanks a lot!
[15:37:58] <_Cody> RohanBhangui: this doesnt show animation at me
[15:37:58] <RohanBhangui> could not do also : $('a.skipBtn')    ?
[15:38:04] <Zzaichik> ^^
[15:38:18] <mmlac-bv> RohanBhangui: that does not trigger on dynamically added elemts
[15:38:27] <mmlac-bv> I would have to manage the triggers myself
[15:38:37] <mmlac-bv> i.e. create a new event listener every time I add or remove an element
[15:38:39] <RohanBhangui> yes if dynamically added then you must do it likshowne you have
[15:38:45] <mmlac-bv> :)
[15:38:47] <RohanBhangui> _Cody: but something like that or a more grainy transition
[15:38:51] <mmlac-bv> thanks for the heads up though!
[15:39:02] <RohanBhangui> mmlac-bv: i did something like that recently so
[15:39:07] <_Cody> more grainy
[15:39:11] <RohanBhangui> kk
[15:39:13] <RohanBhangui> hmm
[15:39:26] <_Cody> I am very unexperienced at animation (just beginner)
[15:39:31] <RohanBhangui> _Cody: im pretty sure jquery does not have anything so you may have to use plugins
[15:39:37] <_Cody> ok
[15:39:53] <_Cody> With some research, effect must be possible :)
[15:40:08] <Zzaichik> mmlac-bv: a lot of people will simply target the body or document element $('body') or $(document) rather than try to remember what the direct parent element is.
[15:40:28] <mmlac-bv> that would work as well
[15:40:42] <Zzaichik> just an option. :)
[15:40:47] <mmlac-bv> thanks :)
[15:42:08] <RohanBhangui> _Cody: try maybe this: use css3 to change scale of image (if its a smal resolution then it will get "grainy") then fade it
[15:42:28] <_Cody> ok
[15:42:39] <RohanBhangui> _Cody: i know its a "hack" and not a solution but its the best ive got :P
[15:42:53] <RohanBhangui> http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_2dtransforms.asp
[15:42:56] <RohanBhangui> that might help
[15:43:44] <RohanBhangui> _Cody: you understanding what im say right?
[15:44:03] <_Cody> i know css3 animation
[15:44:08] <_Cody> will try
[15:45:25] <RohanBhangui> kk let me know if it works

[16:32:37] <eddiemonge> hawtin: thats not enough to go on

[16:43:05] <teza19> Hello, how can I clear the upload field when an error is triggered --> http://jsfiddle.net/bJuYE/5/ ?
[16:43:09] <hawtin> http://codepen.io/DefMos/pen/orzHm this is the pen I've made
[16:44:10] <hawtin> the first function in the right is the problem. it should fill up the skill Offense etc when you expand
[16:44:41] <hawtin> and also progress from 1 to 80% or whatever percentage I set there. I will make a quick pen to see the simple function in action :/
[16:45:40] <hawtin> here is the function and it works .. clearly http://codepen.io/DefMos/pen/qFfAl
[16:46:33] <relipse> what is the best methodology of putting a set of options in a jquery plugin?
[16:47:03] <eddiemonge> teza19: this.value = null;
[16:47:19] <hawtin> so eddiemonge do have any idea why $('id').click(.. ) isnt working
[16:47:22] <hawtin> :|
[16:48:28] <teza19> eddiemonge: i tried putting that under the 'alert' and it doesn't work.
[16:48:44] <eddiemonge> hawtin: i dont see any click
[16:48:49] <RohanBhangui> zman_: any progress
[16:49:10] <hawtin> $('#trig').click(function () {
[16:49:11] <teza19> eddiemonge: scratch that - it does work :)
[16:49:19] <teza19> thank you
[16:49:25] <hawtin> http://codepen.io/DefMos/pen/orzHm
[16:50:09] <relipse> in the wysiwyg redactor editor, how can i make the buttons smaller, they are 25x25 now, i want them 16x16
[16:51:32] <aspect> I'm trying to decorate my <form> elements with an attribute that intercepts their 'submit' action and submits via ajax.  I'm hitting the problem that if the submit is triggered by a <button> or <input type="submit">, it's not included in $myForm.serialize() .. is there an accepted way to address this, before I start messing around?
[16:51:44] <hawtin> the function is not triggered, IDK why :/
[16:52:29] <eddiemonge> hawtin: i dont know whats supposed to be going on there
[16:52:43] <hawtin> eddiemonge when you click on the table row
[16:53:18] <eddiemonge> aspect: say what? you are doing $("form").on("submit') and something is missing?
[16:53:25] <aspect> (the solution I have in mind: capture click events on such buttons and attach the button to a data- attribute on the form; in the submit handler, check for that data- attribute and if present use $.param() to generate a fragment I can append to form.serialize())
[16:53:42] <hawtin> wherever you want, it should expand and upon expanding(clicking the table row) it should fire the first function on the right, which should fill progressively the skill bar and also calculate the percentage 10%, 50%, 98%
[16:53:57] <teza19> is there any reason why this (http://jsfiddle.net/bJuYE/5/) works in JSFiddle, but not on my website? The JQuery code is being referenced at the _bottom_ of the page.
[16:54:27] <aspect> eddiemonge: $('form').on('submit', function(ev) { $.post(.., $(this).serialize ...   if I click on a <button name=do value=update>, "do=update" is missing from my parameters
[16:55:41] <hawtin> @ eddiemonge the only thing I want to do is trigger the first function in the right when you click a table row, which is not happening although I've set the table row id="trig" and then I do $('#trig').click(function () { ... }
[16:57:52] <eddiemonge> hawtin: can you put that on jsfiddle please?
[16:58:07] <hawtin> eddiemonge I can but its not working on jsfiddle idk why
[16:58:16] <eddiemonge> aspect: you too, can you make a jsfiddle example?
[17:03:26] <hawtin> Idk why but jsfiddle is a bummer http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/SMGhv/
[17:03:31] <hawtin> its not working properly
[17:04:17] <hawtin> you can't see what Im trying to achieve :?
[17:04:29] <aspect> eddiemonge: hmm my client reckons you're gone .. http://jsfiddle.net/FtXmC/
[17:05:02] <hawtin> yea@ buh bye
[17:07:59] <TrentonDAdams> So.  I want to hook the change event.  But, if a form submission occurs, which has failed due to bad inputs, I do not want to hook it until after I forcibly fire the change event.  i.e. I want one change handler to fire on page load, while the other one should not fire, but should fire therafter.
[17:08:06] <TrentonDAdams> How would I do that?
[17:09:44] <aspect> for anyone playing along at home .. http://jsfiddle.net/FtXmC/1/ resolves my issue, but it seems like a red flag to me that I can't find anyone else doing it
[17:09:48] <relipse> i'm having a problem, my dynamically created jQuery UI dialog is not on top (it exists because if i press esc it goes away), this just started happening https://raw.github.com/relipse/jquery-dialogPrompt/master/jquery.dialogPrompt.js  Is there a way i can modify my z index to be on top of everything else?
[17:11:43] <relipse> actually i think i figured it out, i spelled "modal" incorrectly
[17:12:23] <hawtin> finally. got it to work in jsfiddle, but IDK why the first time you expand it, it doesnt show anything, after you play around with hide/close it shows the progress bars full and duplicates the percentage numbers. IT makes me mad! http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/2yrda/ anyone has an idea whats up ?
[17:24:36] <relipse> does anyone know how to send an ajax request that could potentially last several minutes?
[17:24:43] <relipse> without letting it timeout
[17:29:05] <aspect> relipse: have you tried the 'timeout' parameter?  Although I suspect "several minutes" could be long enough that browsers may not allow the request to last that long
[17:29:38] <relipse> the idea is to wait for a notification
[17:29:47] <relipse> the server can dispatch the notification whenever it happens
[17:29:58] <relipse> thus making it appear realtime
[17:30:09] <not_mike> how do I force horizontal scroll for 'bar'? >> http://jsfiddle.net/W4Sup/53/
[17:33:55] <aspect> relipse: I'm no expert, but what you speak of rings of "comet" and websockets (socket.io) .. searching those will probably yield you some examples
[17:34:23] <aspect> I have used socket.io a bit - that's quite pleasant, if your server has the capability
[17:34:38] <relipse> aspect: yes that is the idea
[17:34:55] <relipse> not_mike: i can't figure it out sorry, try #css
[17:35:05] <not_mike> I'm in there, they are unresponsive
[17:35:15] <not_mike> thank you for trying relipse
[17:35:28] * aspect knows that wasn't a joke, but unresponsive css still makes me smile
[17:35:51] <relipse> as far as i know css is focusing on being responsive now adays
[17:35:56] <relipse> to support mobile
[17:36:02] <relipse> (;
[17:36:11] <not_mike> huehuehue
[17:36:37] <relipse> overflow-x: auto; is the answer
[17:36:43] <relipse> but its not working in the fiddle you gave
[17:37:02] <relipse> aspect: thanks for the link maybe my boss will install this socket.io thing

[17:40:39] <Columcille> How can I change one part of the text in the innerHTML of an element after page load without losing any bindings on other child elements? Ie, a div has a mixture of links and text; I want to swap out some of the text, but using innerHTML breaks custom bindings on the links.
[17:41:49] <aspect> Columcille: use $.on() to attach your bindings
[17:42:54] <Columcille> aspect: *nod* Did that, but after grabbing innerHTML, running replace for my text, then setting innerHTML the binding is still lost.
[17:46:25] <nutron> I'm trying to graft some code for the dynatree plugin that I found on stack overflow, it's unclear how I access this class that the plugin provides.  The stackoverflow link is: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12277797/jquery-dynatree-search-node-by-name and I can't find how to access the class, there's a discussion on google groups that suggests how to acces it, but still unsure how to find out "where" this class is and where to paste this code.  D
[17:46:25] <nutron> o you fine people have any suggestions on this sort of issue?  Ie.  how I can help myself with the tools available.  Like chrome inspector etc..?
[17:46:35] <nutron> =0 TLDR ....
[17:48:07] <relipse> how can i focus a redactor wysiwyg editor?
[17:48:11] <relipse> and put the cursor right on it?
[17:50:59] <Columcille> aspect: http://jsfiddle.net/thechrisroberts/4eD44/ - note the console. First click shows "we have been clicked" subsequent clicks do not.
[17:53:12] <teza19> Can anyone see why this (http://jsfiddle.net/PphcC/4/) is working in JSFiddle, but not on my website? Nothing is outputted to the console other than 'got into the closure'
[17:56:24] <nutron> K, I think I got it.  Scope is local to the jquery.dynatree.js file
[18:00:40] <Columcille> heh this thing is getting so hackish I don't think I'd try to use it in the wild, but... is there a way to save event bindings in order to set them again?

[19:35:32] <JohnnyCache> oh crap found it -.-
[19:43:58] <monk3y> JohnnyCache: Firstly, props on the Mortak Kombat reference (I hope).  Secondly; what was the error in your code?  Was it that you're using bind when it's deprecated for .on(), or does $(this) look funny.  (I could be wrong on both counts)

[19:59:43] <relipse> how can i scrollTo more slowly?
[20:00:29] <monk3y> james___: if it helps; you might want to lookup jQuery's .setInterval(), and wrap the innermost $('body').append(..) calls in .setInterval(anonymous functions(), time)..

[20:13:52] <tw2113> what is border-left: border?
[20:14:03] <relipse> '1 px solid red'
[20:14:04] <relipse> for example
[20:14:23] <tw2113> ah a variable you're passing in
[20:14:47] <tw2113> try .css({'border-right': border})
[20:14:49] <tw2113> on them
[20:15:00] <tw2113> the curley brackets and colon instead of comma
[20:15:54] <relipse> how do i get the first and last element of a jquery $()
[20:16:10] <tw2113> :first-child perhaps
[20:16:38] <tw2113> just a guess
[20:16:42] <tw2113> :first appears to be valid too
[20:17:28] <relipse> why isn't this code  setSpecificRowBorder() working https://pastee.org/qa3cq
[20:18:01] <tw2113> dunno, don't have a fiddle of it
[20:23:28] <shoky> relipse: 1px  not 1 px
[20:23:52] <relipse> arggg lol sorry silly mistake
[20:24:18] <tw2113> silly goose
[20:39:55] <tw2113> i heard this vile rumor that shoky smells
[20:40:14] <Zavior> I have a function in a javascript file that I want to return when I call it via a jQuery ajax call, what would be the best way to do that?
[20:42:19] <shoky> i smell armpits
[20:42:22] <shoky> <3
[20:42:29] <lenswipee> i heard this rumour that tw2113 is ugly.
[20:42:47] <tw2113> i make a bullfrog look like brad pitt
[20:43:51] <lenswipee> brad pitt not looking too good either
[20:45:02] <tw2113> ok i make them look like angelina jolie
[20:45:58] <lenswipee> angelina jolie has no boobs now
[20:46:03] <shoky> have mercy on the bullfrogs
[20:46:22] <shoky> otherwise they might croak
[20:46:31] * shoky dies
[20:46:54] <relipse> my code is putting a border around one row but when it runs a second time it doesnt delete the border around the first row, any ideas: https://pastee.org/e8wdv
[20:47:18] <relipse> i'm using glb_last_tds$ to keep track of previous border
[20:51:29] <relipse> any ideas?
[20:53:06] <relipse> ok i found it
[20:53:16] <relipse> i set $glb_last_tds$ to false each time
[21:01:43] <Cork> relipse: you really should move your css into the css file where it belongs
[21:01:51] <Cork> and use a class to toggle the border instead
[21:06:01] <tw2113> so much easier
[21:22:41] <srj55> Can anyone recommend a jquery plugin/demo that could handle creating logical AND/OR nested rules?
[21:23:32] <srj55> doesn't need to be dragn'drop...just a way to nest form fields together to create expressions.

[21:36:44] <jewsb> i wanted to have a function of completely hide the shoutbox for a website/forum in greasemonkey
[21:37:17] <jewsb> for this specific forum - http://www.viprasys.org/vb/
[21:38:08] <jewsb> i made a new script by adding "document.getElementsByClassName("dbtech_vbshout_frame")[0].style.display = 'none';"
[21:38:31] <jewsb> but it just hides the chat area, not the whole chatbox
[21:39:15] <Cork> jewsb: sounds like you want to ask in ##javascript instead
[21:39:51] <jewsb> darn
[21:40:21] <Cork> also it looks like an account is needed to see the html
[21:40:40] <jewsb> yup

[21:54:33] <not_mike> why are my divs so spaced out? out do I make them closer together without using negative margins? ->http://jsfiddle.net/W4Sup/72/
[21:55:44] <Cork> spaced out?
[21:55:53] <Cork> you mean the block at the bottom?
[21:58:34] <Cork> not_mike?
[21:58:45] <not_mike> sup man

[22:01:24] <not_mike> thanks very much cork! you are always helpful :)
[22:02:51] <Cork> not_mike: and please only ask in one channel at a time
[22:03:32] <not_mike> ok
[22:03:35] <not_mike> will do
[22:03:41] <Cork> it is very annoying for the other party when they start to dig into a problem and the questioner goes away cause someone else you don't know about is helping them
[22:03:48] <macmartine> not_mike: ^
[22:04:15] <not_mike> crap

[22:39:52] <FND> is there a simple way to make api.jquery.com available offline? I've cloned the Git repo and ran `grunt build`, but the resulting HTML pages in ./dist/ aren't interlinked it appears
[22:39:58] <FND> or rather: there's no index page
[22:45:38] <Lucaszz> hi
[22:46:44] <Lucaszz> Cold you take look at this? Im think that sth is wrong with that code http://pastebin.com/8JJ8rB1q
[23:34:15] <optraz> how do i search a id ending with foo? i have a html id="test-me-foo"
[23:37:39] <Cork> optraz: you can't, and you shouldn't
[23:37:54] <Cork> optraz: only way to do something like that is to search for an attribute (id)
[23:38:11] <Cork> but if you do that you lose all the speed optimizations the browser does for id and class lookup
[23:38:38] <Cork> optraz: the correct thing to do is to add a class to the elements and select based on that instead
[23:39:08] <AdamPDotty> what about div[id$=foo]?
[23:39:58] <optraz> Cork: huh? why not?http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5376431/wildcards-in-jquery-selectors
[23:40:20] <Cork> optraz: cause that is not an id selector
[23:40:27] <Cork> its an ATTRIBUTE selector
[23:40:30] <Cork> like i said before
[23:40:45] <optraz> ohhh
[23:40:52] <optraz> wrong terminology, sorry!
[23:40:55] <Cork> it means it selects all elements in the page, and then checks each one if it has an attribute that ends with foo
[23:41:29] <Cork> and id or class lookup is only a check ageist a hash table the browser has
[23:41:37] <Cork> so its very fast
[23:41:56] <optraz> $("[id$=-foo]") works for me
[23:42:06] <Cork> never said it doesn't work...
[23:42:31] <Cork> but like i said, it is not how you should do it, cause it has real performance problems
[23:43:33] <Cork> $("[id$=-foo]") == $('*').filter(function() { return this.id.match(/-foo$/); }); (basically)
[23:43:59] <optraz> okay, so you are saying your way of doing is much faster compare to mine ?
[23:44:09] <Cork> $('.has-foo') is a document.getElementbyClass('has-foo') and the browser just knows this
[23:44:13] <Cork> yes
[23:44:13] <AdamPDotty> If you want "all ids ending with", it sounds like you might want to add a class.
[23:44:21] <Cork> a magnitude of faster
[23:44:32] <Cork> and the more elements you have, the bigger the difference
[23:44:39] <optraz> ok
[23:44:49] <Cork> and it's not element that match the selector, its elements at all
[23:45:26] <Cork> so, basically, never ever do attribute selecting on an id or class
[23:45:39] <Cork> if you ever see your self needing to you're doing it wrong
[23:47:21] <lethjakman> is there an event for if a div goes above a certain height?
[23:47:41] <Cork> no
[23:48:06] <Cork> there isn't even an event for when the div changes height
[23:48:12] <lethjakman> oh....hm
[23:48:22] <Pal> Hi guys...it's  chilly question but my is breaking.... can any one help me ...  var = "error" need to convert to object or constant variable to get the error message....
[23:48:26] <lethjakman> I'm working with a responsive design and I'm not sure how I should be building the menu...
[23:51:17] <Cork> Pal: 1. var isn't a valid variable, 2. "error" can't be an object
[23:51:46] <Pal> hey sorry var resp = "error"
[23:52:09] <Pal> there is any other way
[23:52:43] <Pal> because i am getting resp from server side as error code
[23:53:21] <Pal> in client cide look into constant js file and replace the content based on error code
[23:53:52] <Pal> there is any alternate way to achieve
[23:53:56] <Cork> optraz: this might be of interest to look at: http://jsperf.com/idlookup
[23:54:26] <Cork> Pal: you can't convert the string "error" to anything other then a string
[23:54:57] <Pal> Ok fine and thank you
[23:56:53] <granden_> If I have something added dynamicly. Like this <li>Article name <a>Remove</a></li> added to a <ul>, when pressing an add button. Then the <remove> wont work for the new one.
[23:57:00] <granden_> <a>Remove</a>

[23:57:18] <Cork> opps
[23:57:22] <granden_> I tried using $('a.remove').on('click', function(e) { and $('a.remove').click(function(){
[23:57:23] <Cork> granden_: ^
[23:57:27] <granden_> Ah ok
[23:57:34] <granden_> Cork: Thanks
[23:57:36] <Cork> on has a delegate syntax too
[23:58:17] <granden_> Delegate or on, then delegate is prefered for this kind of problems?
[23:58:34] <Cork> na, its the same thing, just different function names
[23:58:48] <granden_> ok
[23:59:11] <Cork> $('ul').delegate('li', 'click', function()) {}) === $('ul').on('click', 'li', function()) {})
[23:59:19] <Cork> (notice the second argument to on)
[23:59:24] <granden_> Yes
