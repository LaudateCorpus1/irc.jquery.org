[04:41:45] <ponyrider> can something like this work?         var titles = $("[id*='title-card']").map(function() { return $(this).html() });
[04:42:26] <ponyrider> i want to get the inner html from these objects
[07:12:06] <ace_me> Hi all ! I try to get a SVG element with a specific title of the node with : $('#state_machine g.node[title="place_ok"]') ... any hint please ? it seems wrong
[15:56:28] <Es0teric> theoretically this: $('#data-reports').on('change', '#cutoff-label', function() {}); if its a <select> would change the target #cutoff-label on click correct?
[15:58:57] <taplar> that's going to target any element with an id of cutoff-label that is a child of an element with an id of data-reports
[15:59:29] <taplar> r/child/descendant
[16:04:07] <Es0teric> taplar what if i just want to target #data-reports and then change #cutoff-label"
[16:04:08] <Es0teric> ?
[16:04:31] <taplar> target how?
[16:04:46] <taplar> what are you trying to accomplish?
[16:05:19] <Es0teric> on click of #ata-reports i want to change #cutof-label
[16:05:28] <Es0teric> #data-reports
[16:05:48] <taplar> So you would direct bind on data-reports, and in the handler, look up the cutoff-label and use it
[16:05:54] <taplar> you wouldn't use a delegate for thta
[16:05:57] <taplar> *that
[16:06:46] <Es0teric> well #data-reports is a <select>
[16:06:57] <Es0teric> and so is #cutoff-label
[16:06:58] <taplar> what's the concern with that?
[16:07:20] <Es0teric> idk maybe it matters what kind of element it is?
[16:07:25] <taplar> nope
[16:07:29] <taplar> an id can be on anything
[16:07:43] <taplar> your selector is tag agnostic.  doesn't matter
[16:08:47] <Es0teric> so what do you mean by direct bind on #data-reports though
[16:09:08] <taplar> you're aware of the two forms of binding?  The normal way and the delegate way?
[16:09:29] <Es0teric> i might not know it as that
[16:09:35] <Es0teric> but i am pretty sure i know it
[16:09:48] <taplar> $(selector).on(event, eventHandler) <== normal way or "direct" way
[16:10:02] <Es0teric> ok
[16:10:08] <taplar> $(selector).on(event, descendantSelector, eventHandler) <== delegate way
[16:10:14] <Es0teric> ohhhh
[16:10:19] <Es0teric> ok so yeah i know about that
[16:10:50] <taplar> yeah, so the logic you've described doesn't tell me that you require any sort of relationship between the two elements as far as ancestor/descendant relationships
[16:10:59] <taplar> you just want when one is changed, to change the other, or something
[16:11:05] <Es0teric> yeah exactly
[16:11:17] <taplar> which is just, binding on the one the event should happen for, and in the event handler, find the other thing, and do what you need to do
[16:24:03] <Es0teric> the on change handler is not working
[16:24:10] <taplar> show me?
[16:24:27] <Es0teric> $('#data-reports').on('change', function() {});
[16:24:35] <taplar> in a fiddle or codepen please
[16:25:08] <Es0teric> taplar making it now
[16:28:05] <Es0teric> taplar https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MNvbXO
[16:28:25] <robertmaxrees> <select id="#data-reports">
[16:28:42] <taplar> ^^^ you do not include the # in your markup
[16:28:42] <Es0teric> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MNvbXO
[16:28:46] <Es0teric> i forgot
[16:28:54] <taplar> and also make sure to include jquery in the codepen
[16:32:14] <Es0teric> taplar https://codepen.io/anon/pen/MNvbXO
[16:32:39] <taplar> and it works, :)
[16:40:14] <Es0teric> hmm
[16:45:39] <grapheti> It worked cause taplar smiled
[16:46:02] <taplar> if only that was how my life worked
[16:46:10] <grapheti> LOL
[16:46:43] <grapheti> Not applying enough @$$hole?
[16:47:50] * taplar is not sure how to read that statement
[16:47:51] <taplar> heh

[16:48:11] <taplar> uh, is this sfw?
[16:48:24] <grapheti> it is
[16:48:51] <grapheti> how dare you question me!
[16:48:56] <taplar> ah, bad reference for me possibly, haven't watched any got
[16:49:14] <robertmaxrees> same
[16:49:25] <grapheti> just a general reference
[16:49:29] <grapheti> passive aggressive smile
[17:22:44] <royalty> hello
[17:22:56] <royalty> i'm having problems with replacing some element with html
[17:23:14] <taplar> sure.  you got a fiddle or something, showing what you're trying to do?
[17:23:35] <royalty> give me a second actually i'll make one right now
[17:25:47] <royalty> it works in the fiddle
[17:25:55] <royalty> i must be doing something else wrong, yowzers
[17:27:11] <royalty> https://jsfiddle.net/a2po0tbk/
[17:28:23] <taplar> so it looks like it is working?
[17:28:50] <royalty> yeah, just wanted to plop that in
[17:30:10] <royalty> alright can i be more broad? let's say i have a table and i'm trying to ajax edit a table row, i think you'll know what i mean by that, how do i replace the current row with the one i get back via ajax
[17:30:55] <taplar> Well, regardless of if you are getting the html from the ajax, or building it with data, you'd just do a replace, similar to what you are doing
[17:31:07] <taplar> speaking broadly
[17:31:10] <royalty> i see
[17:31:40] <taplar> however, i would also ask what the operation relates to
[17:32:15] <taplar> such as, if the row you are getting back, is just an updated version of the one you are replacing, that could be potentially done differently
[17:32:22] <taplar> you might just be able to update the existing row
[17:32:56] <royalty> i see what you mean, i honestly could probably just end up doing that...
[17:33:18] <royalty> i'm only changing one field and it seems replacing the whole row is kind of crazy
[17:33:27] <taplar> ^_~
[17:36:06] <royalty> i can probably just use .html() in that case
[17:36:24] <taplar> for the cell or... ?
[17:36:30] <royalty> yeah
[17:36:49] <royalty> it's not actually a table for now, it's a bootstrap card and i'll be replacing the contents of a p element
[17:36:50] <royalty> lol
[17:37:00] <royalty> i just used tables as an example because they were more common
[17:37:13] <royalty> are*
[17:38:24] <taplar> sure
[17:38:52] <royalty> yeah that worked swell,
[17:38:56] <royalty> thank you sir ;)
[17:39:06] <taplar> all you man, :)
[17:52:54] <o||||o> hi, is this the right place to ask about datatables?
[17:53:21] <taplar> yep, though your mileage may vary, :)
[17:53:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:53:38] <robertmaxrees> their forums are probably better, but somebody here might know :)
[17:54:50] <o||||o> thanks. i'm having trouble getting the datatable as a jquery object outside of its initialisation
[17:55:10] <robertmaxrees> gonna have to show some code.
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or somethin'.
[17:55:56] <taplar> iirc though, outside of initialization, you should be able to call dataTables() or DataTables(), which ever it is, to get the instance
[17:57:05] <taplar> https://www.datatables.net/manual/api   under "Accessing The API"
[18:07:46] <o||||o> sorry, i had a delivery
[18:08:26] <o||||o> my problem is when i call those functions, i get an error telling me that i can't reinitialize the database
[18:08:28] <grapheti> not DiGiorno then
[18:09:51] <o||||o> lol there's a company in my area that delivers digiorno
[18:09:59] <grapheti> lmao
[18:10:16] <taplar> https://datatables.net/reference/option/retrieve
[18:12:50] <o||||o> ok, the error is gone, but now it's ignoring all of the other configurations
[18:14:51] <taplar> So in your code you have one place where you are doing the initialization, and now you have in another place nother call do dataTables where all you are giving it is the retrieve: true?
[18:17:02] <o||||o> are you saying retrieve should not be set in the initialization?
[18:17:16] <taplar> that's the way i'm reading this
[18:17:35] <taplar> ", this parameter will cause DataTables to simply return the object that has already been set up - it will not take account of any changes you might have made to the initialisation object passed to DataTables"
[18:19:15] <o||||o> i got the error again
[18:19:27] <o||||o> you're saying to call it like: var table = $('#stafftable').DataTable({"retrieve":true}); ?
[18:19:46] <taplar> yes, after you have done the one that actually initializes it
[18:21:28] <o||||o> ah ha
[18:22:03] <o||||o> the function that initializes the datatables was called after the function where i was trying to use the datatable
[18:33:13] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeee
