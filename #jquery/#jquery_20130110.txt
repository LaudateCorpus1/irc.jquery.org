[00:00:00] <simius> hi!
[00:00:46] <evaluate> If I do: var something = $('#myel').clone(); and then: $('#somethingelse').append(something); I get: [object Object] inside of my second element, instead of the first element. Am I doing something wrong?
[00:01:32] <evaluate> Shouldn't this "copy" the first element inside of the second element?
[00:03:05] <raj> any thoughts on that Aqeel?
[00:03:32] <Aqeel> on what, my browser crashed and i missed quite a few things
[00:04:02] <raj> I said google is able to pop out
[00:04:07] <raj> a new window
[00:04:23] <raj> you can do it during video chat, for example
[00:05:59] <Aqeel> is it online web chat or google chat downloaded
[00:06:09] <raj> online
[00:08:04] <Aqeel> http://www.google.com.hk/talk/
[00:09:05] <raj> oh, video chat plugin?
[00:09:18] <Aqeel> yes
[00:09:27] <raj> I thought that was just for audio/video?
[00:09:31] <raj> to use your webcam/mic
[00:12:02] <Aqeel> well if you see full screen window it either is plugin or somehow in a downloaded form... you cannot go full screen on browser just like that with java script...
[00:13:48] <Cork> Aqeel: thats not true
[00:14:00] <Cork> modern browsers support requestFullscreen
[00:14:29] <Aqeel> yes but with limitations as for auio and video only...not with contents
[00:14:36] <Cork> no
[00:14:39] <Aqeel> audio*
[00:14:50] <Aqeel> show me an example
[00:15:00] <Cork> you can do document.getElementsByTagName('div')[0].requestFullscreen()
[00:15:13] <Cork> ?mdc requestFullscreen

[00:19:44] <Whiskey> Whats wrong on this if ($(this).hasClass('infoViewBox')) {?
[00:20:08] <Whiskey> i try to check if its in the actully class="infoViewBox"
[00:21:47] <Aqeel> how to know which element has that class, this refers to ???
[00:22:11] <Aqeel> if ($(element).hasClass('infoViewBox')) {
[00:23:21] <Whiskey> element what do i need to wrote anything there?
[00:23:24] <Whiskey> as i don´t use any IDs
[00:24:28] <Whiskey> well elements no ids but you normally check id then class
[00:24:35] <Aqeel> not id's but tag
[00:24:46] <Aqeel> if ($(a).hasClass('infoViewBox')) {
[00:24:51] <Aqeel> if ($(p).hasClass('infoViewBox')) {
[00:25:10] <Aqeel> if ($('#ifyouwanttobespecific').hasClass('infoViewBox')) {
[00:25:17] <Whiskey> yeh i did div
[00:25:22] <Whiskey> as its in but it say div not difined
[00:25:31] <marcules> Good Morning
[00:25:42] <Whiskey> if ($(div).hasClass('infoViewBox')) {
[00:25:44] <Aqeel> can give fiddle
[00:26:16] <Whiskey> Aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/15/
[00:26:54] <Cork> Whiskey: document ready doesn't have a scope variable
[00:27:03] <Cork> Whiskey: what element is it you want to check?
[00:27:11] <Cork> if the class exist at all in the dom?
[00:27:34] <Whiskey> first line
[00:27:38] <Cork> if so you use $('.infoViewBox').length > 0
[00:27:47] <Cork> ya but you have no variable "div"
[00:27:53] <Whiskey> Cork, i was try to just assign that function to that class
[00:27:55] <Cork> and this makes no sense in that context
[00:28:07] <Cork> waht function?
[00:28:09] <Cork> 'what
[00:28:12] <Whiskey> lol
[00:28:27] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/15/ the one you see in that one
[00:28:39] <Whiskey> shuld only apply to that div
[00:28:50] <Cork> ah
[00:28:58] <Cork> then you need to rewrite the entire thing
[00:29:09] <Whiskey> yeh i was affraid o fthat
[00:29:14] <Cork> first you need to do something like var $parent = $('.infoViewBox');
[00:29:26] <Cork> then replace all $('selector') with $parent.find('selector')
[00:29:41] <Cork> you can remove the if statement
[00:32:01] <Whiskey> culd have work cork: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/16/
[00:32:34] <Cork> $parent.find('div'); looks wrong
[00:32:59] <Cork> not sure what you're trying to do there
[00:33:13] <Whiskey> me ether
[00:33:57] <Cork> should prob be var children=$parent.find('table').eq(0).find('td');
[00:35:59] <Whiskey> yeh thats work
[00:37:06] <Whiskey> kets hope my thinking works :/
[00:38:20] <Whiskey> Cork: look at this one http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/17/
[00:38:29] <Whiskey> and see the newline in the table
[00:39:52] <Whiskey> I was hoping by do exactly same function and apply it to the next table it won´t happen
[00:41:15] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/18/ clork? why does it not allow me to set a width for that videoinfo
[00:42:55] <sCoRpi_> whiskey: lol, seriously? you want to build a release info site?
[00:43:25] <Whiskey> sCoRpi_ not really
[00:43:44] <Whiskey> its only me that use it
[00:43:51] <sCoRpi_> heh..
[00:44:04] <Whiskey> i don´t share stuff whit ppl its insane
[00:44:19] <evaluate> Any idea why this doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/CTMGn/ ?
[00:44:49] <Whiskey> $(this).css({"width": maxWidth}); <.. dose that not mean if its inside whatever class it only assign the css to that class?
[00:45:29] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/CTMGn/2/
[00:45:46] <Aqeel> evaluate: ^^
[00:45:56] <shoky> evaluate:  because there's an implicit <tbody>
[00:46:18] <evaluate> Aqeel, Thanks! Why doesn't it work with the '.' though?
[00:46:24] <evaluate> s/./>/
[00:46:34] <shoky> evaluate: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CTMGn/3/
[00:46:58] <evaluate> Ahh, I see. Ok, thanks! :-)
[00:47:05] <Aqeel> you have to follow the entire chain > with it
[00:49:08] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/19/ thats closer but it still not count the tds correct but it finds both divs
[00:52:19] <Aqeel> any recommend a good site for debugging
[00:53:47] <Whiskey> Aqeel?You mean like test webbrwsers?
[00:54:03] <mkoks> hi, I have two different ajax calls, for various permission levels. my problem is - when there is no data in database which applies to pattern ajax is demanding first one does as I want - execute function defined by "error" property, but other one does the "success" function, alltought I found out that it says that "data" is null...
[00:56:13] <Aqeel> java-script and jquery
[00:57:21] <Aqeel> info on best practices for debugging jquery and javascript
[00:58:52] <BinaryKitten> Aqeel best practice is to use the debugger within chrome console, or the one in Firebug, the one in opera dragonfly or even the one in the F12 Internet explorer tools
[01:00:13] <sCoRpi_> Aqeel: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[01:00:33] <Aqeel> thanks
[01:00:44] <BinaryKitten> sCoRpi_ thanks .. i couldn't remember the url
[01:00:54] <sCoRpi_> ;)
[01:01:01] <reloadz> hi!
[01:01:58] <reloadz> can you help with code? in l13 I have described the problem: http://pastebin.com/7FcCHmPn
[01:03:13] <greg5green> sCoRpi_++
[01:04:05] <Whiskey> this most work :D
[01:07:40] <tiphares> is it overkill to use jquery to change simple css entries?
[01:09:20] <Whiskey> tiphares? talk to me?
[01:09:42] <tiphares> hm?
[01:10:44] <reloadz> anyone understand my problem?
[01:12:57] <Whirl3d> Whiskey! Don't leave
[01:14:33] <reloadz> no one loves me here! :(
[01:14:53] <xec> I love you, reloadz!
[01:14:59] <xec> <3
[01:15:04] <reloadz> can you help? :)
[01:15:10] <xec> probably not
[01:15:27] <reloadz> :( still! <3
[01:16:24] <xec> that line 14 doesnt make an awful lot of sense to me though
[01:16:30] <Whiskey> Whirl3d?
[01:16:35] <xec> you're supplying a selector string to an if?
[01:17:57] <reloadz> o.O - my defence: i just woke up
[01:18:48] <xec> reloadz: maybe what you need is coffee, not jquery help :D
[01:19:02] <reloadz> still - how to cheack that if element is hovered!
[01:20:11] <Whirl3d> IS this close? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/j5kV9/
[01:20:20] <xec> i'm not sure what you're trying to do to be honest - you're inside a mouseleave event handler attached to three elements
[01:20:41] <xec> what's the use case here?
[01:20:51] <marcules> reloadz, the problem is, that you lose hover if you go onto your newly displayed container, right?
[01:21:25] <reloadz> yes!
[01:21:54] <reloadz> I'm thinking about useing .hover in .hover
[01:22:29] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: look at this http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/23/ <-- that is 100% correct but as you see it just check the first table, and not the secdond one
[01:22:39] <Whiskey> "second"
[01:22:46] <Whiskey> and that was what i try to fix now
[01:31:28] <Aqeel> tiphares: yes it is overkill... use togglecss, adclass, stuff
[01:32:17] <Aqeel> reloadz .hover() is deprecated use on
[01:32:33] <Aqeel> mouseenter: mouseleave:
[01:33:02] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/j5kV9/2/
[01:33:04] <Aqeel> and within first mouseenter makse use of on again with mouse eenter and mouseleave
[01:33:17] <Whirl3d> Whiskey (with the long link)
[01:33:28] <tiphares> Aqeel got more info on that? never heard of it. do you mean js?
[01:33:41] <Aqeel> ?.on()
[01:34:25] <Aqeel> tiphares: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:35:10] <Whiskey> yeh that loos correct Whirl3d
[01:35:42] <tiphares> but you said it was overkill to use jquery, sorry i'm confused Aqeel
[01:36:17] <Aqeel> can you repeat your question, may be mistaken with others..
[01:36:27] <tiphares> "is it overkill to use jquery to change simple css entries?"
[01:36:35] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: don´t really see why you have to change whole style do my way shuld work require less work
[01:37:26] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: did you not look on http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/24/?
[01:37:28] <Aqeel> i mean is to no use css directly in your jquery but usee css sheet and manipulate using jquery provided methods
[01:37:43] <Aqeel> not*
[01:38:04] <tiphares> yeah i'm using the .css() / .width(int) methods
[01:38:11] <tiphares> to manipulate my css sheet
[01:38:19] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/j5kV9/3/<-- Whirl3d: thats not correct
[01:38:31] <Whiskey> it only allow 1 singe space after char for the longest td
[01:38:41] <greg5green> tiphares: he's saying that you should just use addClass and removeClass to change the styling
[01:38:54] <greg5green> then set styles in your stylesheet based on the classes you are adding/removing
[01:39:13] <Whirl3d> Do it your way. I'm not spending another second on this. As much as I would like to say that it's a matter of personal style, I cannot for the life of me se any rhyme or reason to what you are doing.
[01:39:28] <Whiskey> hehe
[01:39:43] <Whiskey> What does this mean? -Infinity
[01:39:51] <Whiskey> javascript console
[01:40:00] <tiphares> greg5green yeah but i'm talking about dynamic values that are determined by user input/number of elements on page etc. stuff i can't set dynamically with the css itself
[01:40:23] <tiphares> so atm i'm using jquery to solve it
[01:41:05] <greg5green> tiphares: in that case, it's only sort of overkill
[01:41:15] <greg5green> you can save some overhead by using pure js to do it
[01:41:25] <Aqeel> yeah..
[01:41:28] <greg5green> its its a bit more complicated
[01:41:35] <greg5green> but not a ton
[01:41:40] <Aqeel> or use plugins..
[01:41:53] <tiphares> yeah that was what i was thinking as well greg5green
[01:41:55] <Aqeel> why reinvent the wheel if it is already there
[01:41:56] <greg5green> BUT, if you are loading jquery to do other stuff, not much point in not using it
[01:42:01] <Pitel_IPEX> http://api.jquery.com/live/ can someone pls fix the first "code box" with those <em>s?
[01:42:05] <greg5green> and Aqeel, you are suggesting to use plugins, but you say to not use jquery?
[01:42:07] <greg5green> cmon
[01:42:31] <greg5green> jquery for changing css values that is
[01:42:36] <Aqeel> well not like just fill your sites with plugins...but if incase is needed
[01:42:55] <tiphares> greg5green yeah i suppose. one would assume the jquery code is as optimzed as it can get
[01:43:03] <tiphares> might as well use it
[01:43:09] <greg5green> tiphares, for the most part yes
[01:43:18] <greg5green> but if you are just finding an element that has an id
[01:43:32] <greg5green> and changing a property on it, its only two lines of js :P
[01:43:54] <greg5green> not worth loading 30-80k for jquery if you arent using it elsewhere
[01:44:27] <Aqeel> jquery is mainly for exhaustive stuff, otherwise can use simple js
[01:44:49] <greg5green> sizzle is great
[01:44:51] <Aqeel> since jquery itself is based on js
[01:45:29] <greg5green> but by the time you load sizzle, you might as well load jq itself
[01:45:44] <tiphares> is jquery made in such a way that i can copy/paste the methods i use out of there, or is it chained together with relations and dependancies?
[01:46:03] <Aqeel> tiphares: what exactly are you doing with the webpage??
[01:46:13] <tiphares> atm i'm just learning jquery
[01:46:51] <Aqeel> ahh, i c.... well then we were just explaining it may be the hard way..
[01:47:21] <tiphares> i know programming, i just haven't used js and jquery specifcially
[01:47:30] <Aqeel> me too..
[01:47:51] <Aqeel> i know js but got into jquery over 2 years
[01:48:29] <tiphares> it's obviously a waste of resources to load up an entire framework if you're using only one of the simpler functions
[01:48:53] <greg5green> tiphares: You might be able to on a case by case situation
[01:48:56] <tiphares> but whether it practically matter is what i'm asking, i guess
[01:49:03] <greg5green> jquery 2.0 will let you compile module versions of the framework tho
[01:49:11] <greg5green> select only what you need for your build
[01:49:16] <tiphares> oh sweet
[01:49:22] <greg5green> but we're only at 1.8.2 :)
[01:49:41] <greg5green> they have gotten the size of jq down quite a bit tho
[01:50:00] <greg5green> it used to be much larger
[01:50:21] <tiphares> yeah the compressed one is quite small
[01:50:21] <greg5green> my company has some sites that still use 1.6 and 1.7 and download 80+kB for jq
[01:50:42] <greg5green> down to 32kB now according to their site
[01:51:24] <mkoks> I dont know where to ask it, but if files/jquery versions are the same on my server emulator and actual web server how can it be that ajax executes different? I dont know if its truly jquery related question however.
[01:51:25] <greg5green> oops, maybe its always been that small and im just dumb, THIS IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
[01:51:47] <greg5green> are you making a cross domain request mkoks?
[01:51:48] <tiphares> greg5green we're only humans eh
[01:52:05] <mkoks> greg5green no

[01:52:30] <Nancy2012> can you please let me know what is the main cause … many thanks in advance..
[01:52:55] <greg5green> lol, i just looked at this one site i did at the beginning of the last year for how big the size of the min.js was
[01:52:56] <greg5green> lol
[01:53:12] <greg5green> wait
[01:53:16] <greg5green> i know what it is
[01:53:23] <greg5green> still my fault
[01:53:28] <greg5green> but not as much as i thought
[01:53:54] <greg5green> django is minimizing the file and not doing a good job
[01:54:13] <greg5green> my bad for not putting a minimized version in the subversion repository
[01:57:40] <Aqeel> bye room

[02:09:43] <seba4> hi i got a question i am kinda new to jquery .... and i need on click hide button and then render some partial/form into dialog box
[02:09:55] <seba4> right now i got this ... $('#new_link').hide().after('<%= j render "form" %>').dialog({title: 'Basic Dialog'})
[02:10:31] <seba4> the problem is that when i press a button button dissapears and shows in dialog
[02:10:47] <seba4> and this render just shows on page not on dialog
[02:11:23] <seba4> i need to press the link in dialog then and then form is viewed in dialog ..
[02:11:27] <seba4> how to fix that ?
[02:12:17] <rethus> how can i check all the checkboxes on the whole page?
[02:13:01] <nFFF> $(':checkbox').prop('checked', true);
[02:14:10] <Cork> nFFF: no that will only set the first one
[02:14:13] <rethus> nFFF: great. thanks a lot
[02:14:29] <Cork> you need $(':checkbox').each(function() { $(this).prop('checked', true); })
[02:15:29] <nFFF> yea my bad, Cork is correct
[02:15:36] <bleutyler> How can I get the value of a select box?  $("#select_id").val() ?
[02:15:45] <Cork> bleutyler: yes

[02:20:20] <Nancy2012> trinadh: it doesn't seem to work when u select the drop down items and hit to submit button..
[02:20:28] <Nancy2012> it always repeat the same error...
[02:21:19] <seba4> why this $('#new_link').hide().dialog({title: 'Basic Dialog', width:500, resizable: false})  render #new_link into dialog? how to turn it off ..
[02:21:27] <reloadz> plz help :'( http://jsfiddle.net/68qJq/1/
[02:22:29] <trinadh> Nancy2012: when you select from select box and fill in the name its validated... other wise it is displaying the message..  , may be i didnt get your question
[02:22:34] <reloadz> problem is described in link
[02:23:31] <Nancy2012> my problem is that…. whenever i submit the drop down item …. it wouldn't show me  up an error massage  which seems work now after your modification …..
[02:23:55] <Nancy2012> but now… when you select the item of drop down … it should not show up an error message..
[02:24:06] <Nancy2012> but it still showing it ...
[02:26:16] <Nancy2012> trinadh: i am really sorry… but yes.. it seems work
[02:26:20] <Nancy2012> sorry…
[02:26:22] <Kingsy> if you have an element in an object called
[02:26:28] <Nancy2012> i was testing in different way ...
[02:26:47] <Kingsy> [span.curr_gbp, span.curr_title] <--   if you do obj.element.text() it would change both nodes in that element.
[02:27:02] <Kingsy> how do you reference each node specifically?
[02:27:07] <Kingsy> I hope that makes sense.. :S
[02:27:08] <seba4> noone cant help?
[02:27:08] <trinadh> Nancy2012: so it is working.. there seems to be an issue with the first line of your code selectlist()
[02:27:21] <mkoks> all you need is a usb tentacle
[02:27:32] <damian_> Does anyone know why calling hasClass on a collection doesn't return a collection(array) of booleans?
[02:27:38] <sCoRpi_> reloadz: you will have to save your timeout into a variable, and use clearTimeout on it, when you hover again
[02:27:40] <trinadh> Nancy2012: if it works, validation doesnt
[02:28:21] <Cork> seba4: .after doens't change what you forward
[02:28:34] <Cork> seba4: so you're actually makeing the button the dialog
[02:29:34] <Cork> seba4: so instead do something like $('<div><%= j render "form" %></div>').appendTo('body').dialog()
[02:29:40] <sCoRpi_> reloadz: also you have a problem with your handlers
[02:29:57] <reloadz> sCoRpi_: shere?
[02:30:05] <reloadz> where? :D
[02:30:09] <sCoRpi_> reloadz: you define the the mouseover handler for  your twitter button inside the "hover-out" function
[02:30:20] <seba4> oh will try..
[02:30:22] <reloadz> yes!
[02:30:27] <sCoRpi_> reloadz: if gets called _after_ the whole function has completed
[02:30:40] <sCoRpi_> "is_hovered" will _never_ be true
[02:31:02] <reloadz> i need to kae out the "hover-out"?
[02:31:08] <reloadz> to take
[02:31:15] <reloadz> from* - sry!
[02:31:49] <sCoRpi_> no, you need to have a is_hovered variable, which is in a global scopre
[02:31:50] <sCoRpi_> scope
[02:32:02] <Kingsy> can anyone offer a hint?
[02:32:03] <sCoRpi_> maybe in your personal namespace
[02:32:21] <sCoRpi_> but still, it looks a bit like a race condition
[02:32:48] <sCoRpi_> or wait, actually it's not. if i'm correct your hover-out-handler will always be called before your mouseover handler is being called
[02:33:12] <sCoRpi_> reloadz: you will also have to keep your timeout in a globally accessible variable
[02:33:25] <reloadz> ok! now you talk too "advanced"!
[02:33:26] <sCoRpi_> so you can reset it from inside our mouseover handler
[02:33:31] <sCoRpi_> give me a sec
[02:35:08] <Kingsy> it would be awesome if you could just obj['placeholder']['specificValue'] <--
[02:35:15] <damian_> Can anyone offer any insight in to the question I posted above? I ask because this behaviour doesn't seem intuitive to me
[02:35:40] <Dervisevic> Hello everyone :) [jquery mobile 1.2.0] Does anyone know if you can disable hash changes on a single button. It's a button that does some ajaxing and updates stuff but i don't want the back button to stop working cause the hash changes.
[02:37:03] <Kingsy> like for example, what happens if an object property is an array.. how are the array nodes referenced?
[02:39:06] <KimPrince> Does anyone know where I can find a quick start guide to jquery ui themes?  This link is dead, http://jqueryui.com/Getting_Started
[02:41:45] <KimPrince> Anyone?
[02:47:50] <sCoRpi_> reloadz: taking too long atm for me, got other stuff to do, sorry. I'd suggest that you use console.log to check when a function gets invoked
[02:47:54] <sCoRpi_> so you'll see the problem
[02:55:45] <Cork> KimPrince: depends on what you need; theres http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Getting_Started
[02:56:15] <reloadz> sCoRpi_: kk
[02:57:00] <KimPrince> Cork: Thanks, looks good
[03:01:12] <dimitris5> Hey, is anybody aware of a plugin that can open/close a div with a map and remember the option using cookies? Or I should combine all of it by myself?
[03:02:41] <Cork> dimitris5: there might be a plugin like that
[03:02:51] <Cork> one related to infinite scroll or similar
[03:02:59] <Cork> but it shouldn't be too hard to do you're self
[03:06:40] <dimitris5> I want to add a map on http://www.jsdelivr.com/ above the search insted of the text. And if someone closes it, the search moves up and takes its place, plus it stays closed with a button to open it again. If you have any ideas on whats the best way to do it, please tell
[03:08:55] <Gune> Hey guys, im a php developer and knows little about webdesign but i was looking for one of those gallery thingies where you have a series of thumbnails in a row with a bigger main image above them, when you click any of the thumbnails below it appears on the top as the big image. Does anyone know what those are called? Or where i could find one?
[03:10:31] <trinadh> Gune: http://tympanus.net/codrops/2009/09/07/42-jquery-image-gallery-plugins/
[03:11:19] <Gune> trinadh: Ah thats nice, thanks a lot mate!
[03:12:05] <trinadh> Gune: you can do a search for image gallery and will get more results
[03:12:13] <_ke> the jQuery.ajax() method has support for error and success functions. however, regardless of what my script returns, if there is no timeout, parserror and similar things the success function will be executed. is it somehow possible to call either the error or success function depending on the return value?
[03:12:53] <Gune> trinadh: True, i just wasnt sure if those kind of things had a specific name or if it's just "image gallery", but i think that site has what i need! Thanks again
[03:13:19] <trinadh> Gune: welcome..
[03:13:54] <Gune> trinadh: Im guessing i can put in a onClick event if i want to send the user to a certain page if the image is clicked aswell?
[03:14:41] <computer2000> can anyone help me with a function recursion problem: http://pastebin.com/0y0sxWiV - the variable 'element' will be overridden each recursion, i need it to have an own scope each recursion
[03:15:04] <trinadh> Gune: depends on the plugin functionality and how much you can customize it..
[03:15:48] <Gune> trinadh: Alright, ill look into it. thanks, and see ya!
[03:16:40] <Cork> computer2000: where does the recursion happen?
[03:16:59] <Sonderblade> what library with jquery do you use to write functional programming style in javascript?
[03:17:03] <computer2000> Cork: line 27
[03:17:09] <Cork> ah
[03:17:59] <Cork> computer2000: what makes you think that the element variable isn't local?
[03:18:39] <computer2000> Cork: sorry if its not the right vocabulary but fact is it gets overridden every recursion and i want to avoid that
[03:18:56] <computer2000> it should be 'local' to every recursion
[03:19:13] <Cork> computer2000: no, there has to be something else that happens
[03:19:25] <Cork> its created locally in the animateRowNextAt
[03:19:34] <Cork> so you get one copy for each instance of that function
[03:21:05] <computer2000> Cork: hm, i understand
[03:34:45] <seba4> can u on dialog add onclose? show some link with id ..
[03:35:51] <seba4> oh just got it  close:
[03:37:53] <seba4> why when i have #id .click  i need to press it twice to react?
[03:38:01] <seba4> this is for dialog
[03:38:20] <Cork> seba4: show you're code
[03:38:46] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/4501438
[03:38:50] <seba4> just gisted it:)
[03:39:49] <Cork> you mean the new_link?
[03:39:53] <seba4> yea
[03:40:00] <seba4> i need to press on it twite
[03:40:02] <seba4> so dialog shows
[03:40:15] <seba4> twice
[03:40:17] <indro> hi all
[03:40:28] <Cork> might depend on the form not sure
[03:40:46] <seba4> meybe because of loading?
[03:41:33] <seba4> no it is not form
[03:41:41] <seba4> just tried with pure text..
[03:41:42] <seba4> and the samme
[03:42:38] <seba4> possible because script isnt loaded yet? because when i open once and then close
[03:42:47] <seba4> then it is working normaly
[03:43:20] <indro> the += operator in .css doesnt work with percent, right? so i need to parse the value to int and to the increment by myself or is there another way?
[03:46:07] <trinadh> seba4: on the first click it gets initialized may be..
[03:58:06] <NodeX> anyone know how to call strings as functions in javascript ..
[04:00:14] <nFFF> you could use eval :P
[04:01:57] <NodeX> apart from eval lol
[04:02:34] <nFFF> perhaps with the new Function() object?
[04:02:42] <nFFF> eval isn't all evil
[04:03:09] <nFFF> eval(string)(); // as long as the string isn't user inputted is there a real issue?
[04:03:26] <NodeX> that works unless it;s dot notation
[04:03:48] <NodeX> function foo() {... works -> eval('foo');
[04:04:19] <NodeX> var foo = { bar : function(){ console.log('Foobar')}} ... eval('foo.bar'); <-- no worky
[04:04:52] <NodeX> which strangly is the same thing as foo.bar.call() and foo.bar.apply();
[04:05:33] <_ke> the jQuery.ajax() method has support for error and success functions. however, regardless of what my script returns, if there is no timeout, parserror and similar things the success function will be executed. is it somehow possible to call either the error or success function depending on the return value?
[04:06:05] <Cork> _ke: its dependent on the http status code
[04:06:17] <Cork> if you return a 4xx or 5xx code the error callback is called
[04:06:20] <NodeX> it seems that fiddle cannot cope with call/apply .. it errors so I can't even fiddle it
[04:06:41] <needinghelp> ]
[04:07:49] <needinghelp> does anyone know where the value for width of an autocomplete box resides, in 1.8.2.css
[04:08:43] <needinghelp> or caor can I set it inside {}
[04:09:04] <needinghelp> code looks like this 	<link rel="stylesheet" href="jquery/css/smoothness/jquery-ui-1.8.2.custom.css" /> 	<style type="text/css"><!--  	        /* style the auto-complete response */ 	        li.ui-menu-item { font-size:12px !important; }  	--></style>
[04:10:10] <needinghelp> <style style=width"500px;" " type="text/css"><!--  	        /* style the auto-complete response */ 	        li.ui-menu-item { font-size:12px !important; }  	--></style>
[04:10:17] <needinghelp> I cant do that right
[04:28:48] <Whiskey> Cork?
[04:29:23] <Cork> ya?
[04:30:33] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/27/ whats wrong there
[04:30:37] <Whiskey> i actully thinked that wuld work
[04:32:11] <Whiskey> Well it prob work but the value i get is not correct :)
[04:32:48] <Cork> define "doesn't work"

[04:34:49] <Jee5us_w> soz
[04:35:58] <aljoscha> Hi! I have two DIVs with float: left; and move the first one to the left (out of viewable area). The second one follows but only until it reaches the window border - WHY? I've created a simple running example on jsfiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/gJJcj/
[04:36:43] <Whiskey> Clork: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/28/ thats is correct, this is incorrect http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/30/
[04:37:38] <Whiskey> Its like its not read both values
[04:39:23] <Whiskey> Clock: do you get it?
[04:39:37] <nFFF> aljoscha http://jsfiddle.net/gJJcj/1/
[04:39:42] <nFFF> this is another way to do it
[04:39:51] <nFFF> you can with animate set your own speed
[04:40:16] <nFFF> change 'slow' to 5000 for instance
[04:41:26] <nFFF> you don't need the -20 in there btw, you could have nothing of course
[04:46:43] <aljoscha> Thanks nFFF! I know animate, but just wanted to show a transparent example for the fact that the following siblings arent affected from the transition anymore, if they reach the window border. The idea with the moving parent div isn't  a solution for my project :(. But thanks for your effort, of course for my jsfiddle example it's a good workaround. So any idea how to keep the siblings following?
[04:47:23] <nFFF> I dont follow
[04:47:36] <nFFF> You cant wrap the elements in a div?
[04:48:46] <Whiskey> Stupid javascript
[04:50:47] <Cork> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/33/
[04:51:28] <Whiskey> Cork thats not correct ether
[04:51:41] <Cork> whats wrong with it?
[04:51:49] <Whiskey> The point of the jQuery script is to just make 1 space after widhest td
[04:52:24] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/28/ if you look at that one you see PreTime: is the widthest only 1 space after it and it works, but it not works if the VideoInfo is the widhest
[04:53:31] <nFFF> If this is just for styling
[04:53:34] <Cork> Whiskey: as the table is 100% width and you search for the widest column
[04:53:40] <nFFF> I think vertical spacing is better
[04:53:46] <nFFF> then changing the width
[04:53:59] <Whiskey> well we can drop that but Cork; it works here
[04:54:01] <Cork> Whiskey: and the table auto adjusts, you can't really do it this way
[04:54:23] <Cork> and i still say this can be done with pure css
[04:55:02] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/34/ but that only apply for firs ttable only
[04:55:13] <Whiskey> Cork i have try many times :)
[04:55:20] <Whiskey> the problem is the table that is in the body
[04:55:23] <Whiskey> thats mess everything up
[04:55:44] <Whiskey> But example 34 is also 100% accurate
[04:55:59] <Whiskey> as long next table not contain more content
[04:57:07] <aljoscha> nFFF: these  elements are pages and are dynamically loaded and removed when the user is swiping between the pages. so the parent div is everytime on the same position, only the content elements are moving to the left/or right. every time are exactly 3 pages loaded: the currently shown, the previous and the next one - the user don't recognices the separate pages, it seems kind of endless. (it's for touch devices)  so i don't see h
[04:58:22] <aljoscha> in was hoping that there is just a little trick to get the following elements keep moving beyond the window borders
[04:58:56] <guy> Is it safe to define jQuery plugin in a DOM ready block?
[04:59:04] <nFFF> I dont really follow, but you can't have an element leave the view port without putting a negative margin on that element or the containing element
[04:59:14] <guy> ie, instead IIFE, using $(function () {});
[04:59:27] <nFFF> your trying to get the second element to follow without actually adjusting its margins or parents margins
[04:59:44] <nFFF> There has to be another 1000 ways around your problem
[05:00:08] <aljoscha> okay thanks! that gives a concrete answer to my question!
[05:00:49] <aljoscha> i will try to build another solution
[05:00:51] <aljoscha> thanks
[05:02:23] <Whiskey> Clork: its real close :)
[05:02:32] <rgenito> is there any way to force code to run AFTER .button() is executed on an element?
[05:03:18] <Whiskey> Clork; if the results always the same whit the extra spaceing it culd be fixed whit - but i don´t think it is
[05:11:05] <Whiskey> nFFF did you talk to me?
[05:19:09] <Whiskey> Clork: I do not understand why it does that what does that extra px comes from??
[05:19:35] <daum> hey guys i'm trying to serialize a form to an array: http://jsfiddle.net/4faBE/1/ As Im doing this part of a bigger post to the server, i am addingi t to a previosuly built array, but when it comes across to the server it is all "[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]"
[05:22:03] <seba4> hi one more question:) how could close dialog on form submit
[05:22:08] <seba4> could i
[05:24:40] <Whiskey> Clark: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/36/ <-> http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/37/ that is correct, and it use your code so why does it get extra px together
[05:25:41] <h0m1x> How can I set a default page to be loaded by using load method in jquery? I have been looking for the answer for one day but I didn't find a proper answer to function.Hope someone will answer!
[05:27:26] <rohdef> is there any recommended jquery tutorials?
[05:41:14] <iman> Hi, I was googling but i didn't find something special, how can I force a page just load from a load() function not from address bar ?
[05:43:04] <Somatt_wrk> iman: are you looking for window.location ?
[05:45:21] <iman> no, I have a page for example one.jsp, I can visit this page either load this page from home.jsp like $("#div").load('one.jsp') and this address from address bar, i want  to block request from address bar
[05:45:38] <iman> it just load through load();
[05:49:06] <jugglinmike> iman: you can't force the browser to ignore text entered into the address bar
[05:49:31] <iman> jugglinmike: there is not anything like Ajax call ?
[05:49:59] <jugglinmike> I'm not sure I understand the question
[05:50:29] <Somatt_wrk> iman: I concur with jugglinmike two previous statements
[05:51:11] <iman> i want to load a page just with load() function and not other way
[05:51:21] <Somatt_wrk> iman: you can't force the browser to ignore text entered into the address bar
[05:51:35] <iman> ok
[05:51:51] <Somatt_wrk> the best you could do is to send another content if the request is not coming from a XHR request
[05:52:18] <Somatt_wrk> i.e. direct call to one.jsp would send the same thing as a direct call to home.jsp, or redirect there
[05:52:29] <Somatt_wrk> while an ajax call would serve a different content
[05:52:33] <Somatt_wrk> from the same url
[05:54:46] <iman> Somatt_wrk: I found to handle it with referer
[05:55:25] <iman> Somatt_wrk: how can i find is this XHR request or not?
[05:55:43] <Somatt_wrk> iman: that you will need to ask in #java
[05:56:32] <iman> Somatt_wrk: Hmmm, you mean, I detect XHR request in java and serve another content if it's not hr
[05:56:36] <iman> xhr*
[05:56:39] <Somatt_wrk> indeed
[05:56:41] <iman> good idea, thank you dude
[05:56:46] <iman> Somatt_wrk: jugglinmike thank you
[05:56:54] <Somatt_wrk> beware of duplicate contents though
[05:56:58] <seutje> I usually use separate paths for my xhr calls
[05:57:01] <jugglinmike> np iman. good luck
[05:57:09] <seutje> like /foo is the regular page /foo/json only returns the data in json
[05:58:41] <nickSwe> For some reason, I get "Permission denied" when running this code in Firefox:     var fetchForm = $.ajax({});         any ideas?
[05:59:55] <iman> Somatt_wrk: I've another one question maybe you could help me, I create a ajax request when I want to submit a form like this http://jsfiddle.net/cBSVY/ actually I create a form as data, I know there are best way to create json, but i don't know what is that API to create an post a form with json
[06:01:40] <tomasm-> hi, is there a delay or possible async issue when calling code like: $('img').css('left', 50); $('img').trigger('save') # where bind('save', function() { console.log($('img').css('left'); }) ??? I'm having trouble getting the position I put in
[06:02:38] <iSeeDeadPixels> stupid internet explorer and ajax calls and assigning a json thingy to var markers and it being null because the request ain't done yet and IE still trying >< stupid browser... chrome etc. works :/
[06:02:41] <tomasm-> the trigger thinks the position is 0,0, no matter what I set to left,top beforehand
[06:05:42] <h0m1x> How can I set a default page to be loaded by using load method in jquery? I have been looking for the answer for one day but I didn't find a proper answer to function.Hope someone will answer!
[06:09:35] <tomasm-> can anyone explain why $('img').position().top would be 0 (or auto) immediately after setting it via $('img').css('top', 250), and yet within a setTimeout (a delay), it then says the properly set value?
[06:10:21] <tomasm-> ie it takes a second before the position is changed
[06:11:18] <therealkoopa> Know of any in place type editor plugins where a paragraph becomes editable in place? Perhaps borderless inputs so it's clean
[06:12:13] <tomasm-> jeditable, but that requires you click to edit
[06:12:20] <tomasm-> click on the text that is
[06:12:36] <tomasm-> just style it how you want
[06:13:53] <sCoRpi_> tomasm-: that doesn't sound logical.
[06:13:54] <therealkoopa> tomasm-: thanks
[06:14:06] <tomasm-> sCoRpi_, what?
[06:14:12] <sCoRpi_> tomasm-: if you try to do something in the console, changes are reflected immediatly
[06:14:19] <sCoRpi_> your problem regarding the position
[06:14:23] <sCoRpi_> can you build a testcase?
[06:14:44] <tomasm-> sCoRpi_, hold on.... is there a place to paste this?

[06:24:13] <Ansikt> So, I think there's a jquery conflict somewhere on my page.  Are there any quick ways to check where this may be coming from?
[06:24:20] <macsim> hi, is it possible to get all <select> with name starting with 'C' ? exemple C1_foo , C5_bar_foo etc... ?
[06:25:03] <Ansikt> mascsim: I think $*('select(name=C*]')
[06:25:14] <Ansikt> mascsim: I think $*('select[name=C*]')
[06:25:40] <Ansikt> ^^ Sorry, used a parenthesis instead of square bracket the first time
[06:26:25] <tomasm-> sCoRpi_, i think my problem was not having position: relative on the image. odd thing though was that the position still changed, but didnt show up immediately in the css.... and yet did a split second later. position: relative made it immediate. go figure (chrome)
[06:27:21] <sCoRpi_> tomasm-: if you use static positioning, it shouldn't move at all
[06:27:55] <tomasm-> yeah, not sure why it worked
[06:28:01] <macsim> Ansikt, when I try to disable it it said css is not a function I tried $*('select[name=C*]').css('display','none');
[06:28:24] <tomasm-> $*() ? or $()?
[06:28:34] <tomasm-> macsim, ^
[06:29:50] <macsim> tomasm-, Ansikt I tried $^ => Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=C*] and with $* I got NaN
[06:30:12] <Ansikt> mascism:  Yeah, typo, my bad.
[06:30:41] <macsim> Ansikt, with $() it said NaN
[06:30:52] <tomasm-> macsim, I meant "^" as in "hey you"... it should be $(...)
[06:31:14] <macsim> tomasm-, ah ok my bad, with $() it said Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=C*]
[06:36:09] <tomasm-> macsim, http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:37:06] <tomasm-> macsim, i would recommend instead of naming and grabbing the selects based off a regex of the name, to add a class to it so it's much easier/more reliable
[06:37:26] <tomasm-> and then just select.newClassName

[07:00:49] <Loiseau2nuit> hi there
[07:02:05] <Loiseau2nuit> May someone help me with a JQueryUI issue please ?
[07:02:19] <Brodingo> ?ask
[07:02:19] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:02:33] <Loiseau2nuit> yeah ok ^^
[07:02:44] <Loiseau2nuit> I'm trying to get .tabs() to work on a website
[07:02:53] <Loiseau2nuit> but Firebug seems not to afgree
[07:02:55] <noregret> when I use the arrow keys to go up/down in a <select> change() event doesn't get fired, why ?
[07:02:56] <Loiseau2nuit> -f
[07:03:14] <guy> can anyone help me to understand the initial glitch with the left moving marquee? https://dev.anuary.com/60244f3a-b8b2-5678-bce5-f7e8742f0c69/
[07:03:15] <Loiseau2nuit> and says ".tabs is not a function"
[07:03:27] <Loiseau2nuit> and of cource, my tabs do not work
[07:03:49] <Brodingo> make sure jquery ui is being loaded
[07:03:52] <Loiseau2nuit> with JQery 1.8.2 & ui 1.8.21
[07:03:59] <Loiseau2nuit> yes it is !
[07:04:20] <Loiseau2nuit> I've got another widget, elsewhere on this site wich works properly so ... ???
[07:04:36] <Brodingo> make sure youre calling it on a jquery object?
[07:04:39] <Loiseau2nuit> I'm working on a CMS wich embed JQueryUI as a plugin
[07:04:49] <Loiseau2nuit> Brodingo: what do you mean ?
[07:05:03] <greengriminal> I cannot get a jquery-ui dialog to correspond to the <td> that is clicked. What I am trying to do is register the event on the table. Then the row that is clicked can be accessed via the event. I have initially have: https://gist.github.com/4502709 and have tried to do https://gist.github.com/4502710
[07:06:04] <Brodingo> Loiseau2nuit how are you calling .tabs() ?
[07:06:38] <Loiseau2nuit> Brodingo: with $("#my-super-css-id").tabs();
[07:07:00] <amcsi_work> hello
[07:07:04] <Loiseau2nuit> where my-super-css-id is the css id of the containing div (which itself contains a ul>li list)
[07:07:11] <Brodingo> Loiseau2nuit what CMS?
[07:07:17] <Loiseau2nuit> SPIP
[07:07:26] <amcsi_work> how can I detect whether an ajax call's error method was called due to timeout by the value I set as timeout?
[07:07:28] <Loiseau2nuit> http://www.spip.net/en
[07:08:01] <Brodingo> well i can make a lot of guesses, if you can post code or a link that would be helpful
[07:08:53] <noregret> Loiseau2nuit: also cehck in the net tab if jquery-ui is loaded
[07:09:12] <lasha> Hello kind people.
[07:09:13] <Loiseau2nuit> noregret: allready checked ! it is loaded
[07:09:24] <lasha> How do you get &copy; to work on Android? lol
[07:09:47] <guy> Brodingo: https://github.com/gajus/marquee
[07:09:49] <Loiseau2nuit> Brodingo: actually, I'm trying to get a thing quite similar to http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#vertical
[07:10:01] <Brodingo> guy ?
[07:10:11] <guy> oh. I thought that was addressed to me
[07:10:54] <^Mike> I have <td><img><img><img></td> - if $(this) is one of those image elements, how can I write a selector that will match the other 2 siblings?
[07:11:18] <Brodingo> ?siblings
[07:11:18] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[07:11:36] <^Mike> well now I just feel dumb, don't I? :)
[07:11:43] <Brodingo> ;)
[07:11:53] <superjacaman> hey guys someone know how can i verify if an image is loaded or not ?
[07:11:59] <noregret> when I use the arrow keys to go up/down in a <select> change() event doesn't get fired, why ? what other event can I use for that
[07:13:06] <bil`> How do I structure a custom event listener to retrieve data being passed to it? Here's my trigger $.event.trigger({type:"editSurveyQuestion", surveyID: surveyID, questionID:questionID});
[07:13:08] <Brodingo> superjacaman possibly https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[07:13:09] <jost> superjacaman, check the complete-property on that image
[07:13:12] <Brodingo> havent used it
[07:13:33] <superjacaman> jost where and i see this property ?
[07:13:38] <superjacaman> where can*
[07:14:40] <jost> it is not a jQuery property. You can get it via <jqueryObject>.get(index).complete
[07:15:11] <superjacaman> but ies don't support this like allways
[07:16:07] <jost> I don't know, but from what I remember from my research, IE >= 7 supports it
[07:16:11] <jost> at least
[07:17:20] <superjacaman> thank's
[07:18:27] <zubelgenubi> for some reason, my redirects are not working with the jquery mobile ajax behavior on production server. They worked on dev - what gives?
[07:20:55] <zubelgenubi> they also work if data-ajax="false"
[07:21:04] <zubelgenubi> i dont get what is different here...
[07:21:43] <NodeX> redirects?
[07:22:02] <zubelgenubi> sending headers
[07:22:14] <NodeX> Location: /foo ?
[07:22:18] <zubelgenubi> im using codeigniter redirect() function
[07:22:20] <NodeX> that kind of thing?
[07:22:33] <zubelgenubi> ... hold on
[07:22:51] <zubelgenubi> yes, im using relative links in the code
[07:22:56] <NodeX> this is bizarre, I litteraly just wrote a workaround for jquery not being able to read "Location" headers
[07:23:19] <NodeX> unfortunately you'll need to adapt your function to spit out a custom header
[07:23:31] <zubelgenubi> ok, show me the way!
[07:24:06] <zubelgenubi> im not yelling, just thankful for a lead on this problem
[07:24:25] <NodeX> make your codeignitor spit out this ... header("X-Location: /your-location");
[07:24:37] <NodeX> (before what it already does)
[07:24:44] <zubelgenubi> ok
[07:25:00] <NodeX> http://pastebin.com/Wv7Zm2cS
[07:25:19] <NodeX> put that in your javascript include for each page you want it on
[07:26:08] <zubelgenubi> wow great, let me try this...
[07:26:18] <glazenraam> hi all
[07:26:30] <BillCriswell> bil`: I haven't had a chance to mess with these yet, but I think you want .trigger('eventName', { foo: 'bar' } );
[07:26:55] <BillCriswell> bil`: Based on second example on this page. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[07:27:00] <Loiseau2nuit> noregret: actually, I verified again the NET panel and :
[07:27:10] <Loiseau2nuit> 1/ jquery-ui is loaded (core + widget)
[07:27:17] <NodeX> you can probably do one better in your redirect() function .. something like ... if(strtolower($_REQUEST['X-Requested-With']=='xmlhttprequest')) { header("X-Location:/blah"); } else { header("Location: /blah"); }
[07:27:18] <bil`> I had no luck with the literal, but using 'event name', ['param1', 'param2'] works
[07:27:21] <Loiseau2nuit> 2/ tabs is not, despite I manually called it
[07:28:25] <glazenraam> I'm using jQuery in Chrome. I'm trying to send a floating point number (23.23) to the server using $.post(). When I hover in Chrome's javascript debugger over the variable i want to send, it correctly shows 23.23 (as a float, not as text). However, when I look in the network tab, the value 2323 is sent to the server
[07:28:38] <glazenraam> is this a known bug/limitation?
[07:28:48] <BillCriswell> bil`: Sweet.
[07:29:29] <glazenraam> I think I can't be the only one who wants to send floats to a server..
[07:30:19] <NodeX> can you confirm this on the server?
[07:31:15] <glazenraam> NodeX: yes, the server also receives 2323 instead of 23.23
[07:31:46] <glazenraam> I tried to google it, but didn't find something
[07:31:52] <NodeX> can you pastebin your code?
[07:33:24] <glazenraam> NodeX: yes, after I try one change
[07:34:26] <Loiseau2nuit> ok tabs are fixed !
[07:34:41] <Loiseau2nuit> bug was a PEBKAC :-$
[07:36:05] <NodeX> lol
[07:38:28] <Loiseau2nuit> thanks to those who tried anyway ;-D
[07:38:34] <zubelgenubi> arrgg - NodeX, now redirects arent working even outside jquerymobile
[07:38:42] <Loiseau2nuit> and happy new year everybody ;)
[07:38:47] <zubelgenubi> www.tech.goldenrulecomfort.com
[07:39:02] <zubelgenubi> is supposed to redirect to www.tech.goldenrulecomfort.com/home
[07:39:07] <NodeX> did you remove header("Location: ..."); ?
[07:39:23] <NodeX> I dont really have a clue about code ignitor tbh it's a pos
[07:40:25] <glazenraam> NodeX: I'm sorry, I misinterpreted the "preview" tab of Chrome..
[07:40:28] <mattyh88> hey, is there a way to login to a form on another site by clicking a link on my site?
[07:40:53] <zubelgenubi> here is redirect function - http://pastebin.com/cTbj2bym
[07:40:53] <NodeX> glazenraam : LOL
[07:41:05] <evildmp> If I see a 125TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'config.add_urls[config.content_type_id].add_url'), then what in that is 'undefined'? does it mean that the value of 'config' is 'undefined'?
[07:41:25] <glazenraam> NodeX: however, ASP.NET MVC4 seems to have a strange parsing of floats - the parameter in my controller action is of type "decimal"
[07:42:03] <NodeX> you'll need them both zubelgenubi
[07:42:12] <NodeX> if(strtolower($_REQUEST['X-Requested-With']=='xmlhttprequest')) { header("X-Location:/blah"); } else { header("Location: /blah"); }
[07:43:18] <zubelgenubi> oh, thanks.  Also - stupid me, I was trying the redirect with javascript off, not loading your script!
[07:43:21] <zubelgenubi> oops
[07:43:23] <mazzachre> If I set my width to $(this).parent().innerWidth()-$(this).prev().outerWidth(true) then the element becomes too big for the flow and goes to the next line... On my current display I have 4 pixels too much, where do they come from? And how do I find them?
[07:44:02] <NodeX> outerWidth(true) includes border and padding iirc
[07:44:46] <lerise> Hi guys
[07:45:06] <mazzachre> Yes, that is the point... I have 2 elements in my parent element... this and .prev() and I want my element to take up the rest of the space...
[07:45:56] <lerise> How can I get a list with the value of all of the names under "nombre" column in here: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Comunas_de_Chile
[07:46:35] <lerise> I know i should use .html() on tbody tr td td b a
[07:46:41] <lerise> or something like that
[07:47:01] <zubelgenubi> NodeX, what is this?  Undefined index: X-Requested-With
[07:47:07] <lerise> on the console, so i can have a nice list and populate a dropdown
[07:48:07] <NodeX> it's to check that the request was ajax or nt
[07:48:09] <NodeX> not *
[07:48:20] <Brodingo> ?map
[07:48:21] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[07:48:57] <mazzachre> lerise: WIthout actually looking, I would do something like $('tbody').find('td:nth(2)').each(function() {...add to array here...});
[07:49:23] <lerise> mazzachre: sounds good
[07:50:15] <lerise> .map looks good too
[07:52:57] <Brodingo> lerise given what you described i would say try .map()
[07:53:16] <lerise> cool
[07:53:20] <lerise> im trying to use map right now
[07:53:50] <lerise> I'm having problems targeting the element
[07:54:33] <zubelgenubi> ok, getting closer.  My server is not setting the variable $_SERVER['HTTP-X-Requested-With']
[07:56:27] <lerise> While doing this $('tbody tr td:nth(2) b a').map(function() {       return this.title;     }).get().join(); i only get the first value
[07:56:53] <lerise> If i use this.html I get an empty string :S
[07:56:55] <nabr0_> lerise: run this in your console and see if it gives you back what you want - $('.wikitable td:nth-child(2) a').each(function(){ console.log( $(this).text() ) });
[07:57:13] <lerise> nabr0_: that did it :)
[07:57:40] <lerise> looks cleaner and easier the way you did it
[07:57:44] <lerise> thank you very much
[07:57:59] <nabr0_> depending on what you want to do with the data will depend on if that's the right way to go but at least you can use that selector
[07:58:10] <ciphergoth> Am I right in thinking that jQuery includes code to parse (ie sanitize) JSON, but never needs to generate it and so includes no generation code?
[07:58:24] <lerise> nabr0_: that's exactly how i needed the data
[07:58:39] <lerise> fun thing is that palces that start with ñ get listed at the end
[07:58:41] <ciphergoth> I note that the answers to this question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1749272/jquery-how-to-put-json-via-ajax say "use a JSON library", which suggests that jQuery doesn't incldue one
[07:58:45] <lerise> *places
[08:00:36] <zubelgenubi> oh, I have to check if isset($_SERVER['http_x_requested_with'])
[08:02:04] <systemfault> ciphergoth: jQuery only offers a JSON.parse shim, not a JSON.stringify one..
[08:02:18] <ciphergoth> systemfault: that makes sense
[08:02:24] <Syco54645_work> hello, i am having issue getting jquery to display the selected option in a html select box. if i do a console.log($(this).closest('td').siblings('td').children('.state')); i can see the object but as soon as i add option:selected to the class it returns nothing. any ideas?
[08:02:57] <ciphergoth> systemfault: so it sounds like I should just use https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js which under normal circumstances uses code built in to the browser
[08:03:51] <systemfault> ciphergoth: That's the usually recommended workaround for that
[08:04:15] <ciphergoth> is json2.js still everyone's favourite way to generate JSON in JS?
[08:04:28] <systemfault> ciphergoth: If you need to support IE7... yes.
[08:04:32] <ciphergoth> heh
[08:04:46] <ciphergoth> everything else has it built in?
[08:04:53] <systemfault> Yeah :/
[08:05:32] <NodeX> zubelgenubi : it's REQUEST not  SERVER
[08:05:47] <NodeX> sorry
[08:05:50] <NodeX> typo
[08:06:19] <NodeX> if(strtolower($_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'])!='xmlhttprequest') { ... not REQUEST, my bad, heads miles away
[08:06:54] <NodeX> and your server should simply pass on the Request headers as it's one of those
[08:08:33] <zubelgenubi> ok, got that.  This is what I have now http://pastebin.com/9H22YjFg
[08:08:49] <zubelgenubi> now I'm getting typeerror: redirect is null
[08:09:00] <tiphares> should all jquery-related code be wrapped with a single $(document).ready()?
[08:09:12] <NodeX> you've set one to HTTP-X-Requested-With and one to the same but lowercased
[08:09:27] <NodeX> tiphares : you can use multiple doc ready's
[08:10:06] <NodeX> zubelgenubi : the type error is a javascript error, outside doc ready put this.... var redirect;
[08:13:51] <zubelgenubi> hmm, still getting it.   is this right? http://pastebin.com/6FbiU4Hv
[08:15:09] <NodeX> looks good to me
[08:15:43] <zubelgenubi> still null.   tried var redirect='';  no dice
[08:15:55] <zubelgenubi> lemme reset cache mebbe
[08:17:02] <zubelgenubi> nope still null
[08:21:23] <NodeX> which line is it referring to?
[08:21:50] <zubelgenubi> line 10 if redirect.length ...
[08:22:33] <NodeX> put a "console.log(redirect)" above it and see what it logs
[08:22:45] <zubelgenubi> just above?
[08:22:59] <NodeX> just above the if(
[08:25:13] <zubelgenubi> hmm, still null
[08:25:42] <NodeX> cehck the headers and see what;s there for "X-Location"
[08:26:00] <NodeX> check *
[08:27:02] <Whiskey> http://tinkerbin.com/G7EPN3vE <-- See the middle border its not fill out 100% how do i slove that?
[08:30:51] <t432> working with jquery validator plugin... trying to test a condition statement not sure if this is correct way to do it => rules: {username: {minLength: 3,depends: function(){username != null;},}}
[08:31:02] * fgro jquery noob.
[08:31:36] <t432> the depends statement seems odd
[08:31:38] <t432> anyone?
[08:31:49] <iman> what is background orange color in this site? http://app.championsound.com/login is it image?
[08:32:42] <fgro> a question regarding page fragment loading with jquery.load(): say "$('#b').load('article.html #target');" something like "$('#b #target').hide()" won't work in the same js block. Impossible? How can I do this?
[08:33:51] <zubelgenubi> NodeX, http://pastebin.com/DWt7kuAM
[08:33:55] <zubelgenubi> don't see x-location
[08:34:37] <fgro> to put it in words, can page fragments inserted with jquery.load() be manipulated in the same call?
[08:35:07] <BillCriswell> fgro: As long as they're in the DOM you should be able to do whatever you want with them.
[08:35:37] <BillCriswell> fgro: There's is a complete callback you can use.
[08:36:22] <coachz> How come i get TypeError: $ is not a function for:  $(document).ready(function() { alert("hi");  });    //jquery is loading fine.
[08:37:15] <fgro> BillCriswell: doesn't work for me. the selector $('#b') still references the old DOM content though I'm accessing it after the "load"
[08:37:19] <BillCriswell> coachz: $ might being loaded as something else after jQuery is loaded.
[08:37:44] <BillCriswell> fgro: You have two elements with the id of #b?
[08:38:54] <fgro> BillCriswell: no please look at the code example "$('#b').load('article.html #target');" ... now $('#b > * ') still shows the original content, not the loaded dom.
[08:38:55] <coachz> ok my jquery drop menu is hosing it up
[08:38:57] <coachz> hmm
[08:39:08] <coachz> does that mean it is coded wrong ?
[08:39:24] <ravenzz> ?demo @ coachz
[08:39:25] <bot-t> coachz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:39:33] <coachz> the drop menu code starts with   jQuery.noConflict();(function($){
[08:39:56] <coachz> so is that improper for him to be "stealing" $
[08:40:32] <BillCriswell> I have no idea why a jQuery dropdown menu would run that.
[08:41:21] <coachz> thanks, i'll find another menu
[08:42:39] <BillCriswell> coachz: IT could be as simple as removing jQuery.noConflic();
[08:42:41] <zubelgenubi> NodeX, gotta take a break...    Many thanks for getting me this far!
[08:42:48] <NodeX> no probs
[08:42:58] <coachz> but leave the  (function($){  in his function ?
[08:43:23] <coachz> fixed, thanks !
[08:43:53] <BillCriswell> fgro: Are you running the query again?
[08:44:10] <autoboxer> Has anyone run into an issue I'm having where jQuery tabs are loading the entire page content into a tab vs. just the content contained in the tabs <div> element?
[08:44:22] <BillCriswell> If you run $('span.foo') then change then remove it from the dom and add it again it you need to rerun it.
[08:44:23] <fgro> BillCriswell: i think this also explains my problem.
[08:44:26] <fgro> BillCriswell: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3824118/manipulating-elements-after-ajax-load?rq=1
[08:44:31] <nabr0_> not sure it's improper as he's insuring that if multiple libraries are being use that $ is mapped back to jquery
[08:46:13] <Dr4g> basic $(elem).data() problem here.    $('#content').find('form').data('group'), returns 1     $('#content').find('form').data('group', 5); executes but then  $('#content').find('form').data('group') still returns 5 and not 1
[08:46:23] <Dr4g> still returns 1 and not 5 **
[08:46:35] <Dr4g> i.e: the DOM is not not changing from data-group="1" to data-group="5"
[08:46:37] <Dr4g> Help? :-)
[08:47:06] <systemfault> Dr4g: .data doesn't touch the dom
[08:47:09] <ravenzz> data() doesn't change
[08:47:11] <dcherman> Dr4g: .data() does not keep data-attributes in sync, it's read only ( and first time read only )
[08:47:13] <BillCriswell> fgro: I just tried it out and it worked fine for me.
[08:47:14] <ravenzz> the data- attribute
[08:47:18] <fgro> BillCriswell: I figured it out. just passing along a callback function with load().
[08:47:31] <fgro> BillCriswell: sorry for the confusion. As I said. I'm a noob. ;-)
[08:47:34] <Dr4g> aha, so it updates the jQ object but not the DOM, no problem :)
[08:47:43] <Dr4g> i was looking in Inspector at the DOM expecting it to change.
[08:48:11] <BillCriswell> fgro: If you were doing $('#data').load('foo.html'); $('.newElementFromFooDotHtml').text(); it would not work because async.
[08:48:14] <systemfault> Dr4g: It's faster that way, DOM updates are all slow.
[08:48:40] <Dr4g> systemfault: yea i get it i was just expecting the DOM to change, when it's designed not to :)
[08:48:44] <Dr4g> it is indeed working afterall
[08:48:44] <BillCriswell> load('foo.html', function(){ $('.newElementFromFooDotHtml').text() }); would be A O K.
[08:48:50] <ravenzz> Dr4g you can always change it .attr("data-gropup", 5); though
[08:48:58] <Dr4g> ravenzz: noted indeed.
[08:49:49] <BillCriswell> nabr0_: Why should the plugin force you to give up $?
[08:50:51] <autoboxer> Has anyone run into an issue I'm having where jQuery tabs are loading the entire page content into a tab vs. just the content contained in the tabs <div> element?
[08:53:09] <rudiX> var funkt = $(this).attr('value'); ... how to call function with the same name funkt+''() not work
[08:53:14] <nabr0_> BillCriswell: is it forcing you to give it up or ensuring that it's available to use? based on the docs, the purpose is to preserve it for that plugin incase another lib is using it
[08:54:54] <BillCriswell> nabr0_: jQuery.noConflict() gives up $.
[08:55:28] <NoiseEee> rudiX: what?
[08:55:59] <rudiX> funkt is dynamic
[08:56:43] <dcherman> rudiX: you changed "funkt" from a function to something else.  it's not a function anymore, you can't invoke it.
[08:56:51] <nabr0_> BillCriswell: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/#example-1 unless i'm not understanding the docs, it's not…?
[08:57:15] <rudiX> damn
[08:57:31] <rudiX> Code Inspector looks nicer with real name functions
[08:57:52] <dcherman> nabr0_: callign .noConflict changes the value of $ back to whatever it was before jQuery was loaded.  a plugin doing that behind your back is being a jerk.
[08:58:19] <BillCriswell> dcherman: Exactly, a big stupid meaning head.
[08:58:24] <BillCriswell> meanie*
[08:59:27] <nabr0_> then what's the proper way to support $ for multiple libraries? besides not using $?
[09:00:29] <BillCriswell> nabr0_: (function($){ })(SomeLibrary);
[09:00:32] <dcherman> nabr0_: use an IIFE for your plugin if you want to use $ - (function($) { /* your plugin code */  }(jQuery))
[09:00:41] <dcherman> let the end user manage $ of they want to use multiple libs
[09:01:02] <nabr0_> thanks
[09:01:55] <fvdjango> Hi guys, I am new to jquery and I was wondering if someone could help me with something. I've described the goal and provided my code here: http://pastebin.com/sjykU9U8
[09:03:37] <BillCriswell> fvdjango: First, There's no .onClick, you probably want .on('click', function(){ });
[09:04:44] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: Hmm, ok thanks! I'll try that
[09:04:50] <BillCriswell> You should be using "var" as well. They're all globals now.
[09:05:22] <BillCriswell> fvdjango: Also, If you're targeting a class you need a . before 'commitments-hidden'.
[09:05:35] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: Yeah, I actually just caught that and added it
[09:06:41] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: Otherwise, does it make sense what I am trying to do? Find both classes separately, assign to variables, and then change the state of those variables?
[09:07:23] <scar> How can i build my own phone on my site that makes real calls? lol
[09:09:28] <BillCriswell> fvdjango: It does. It's a little messy though. How about this: http://jsbin.com/ewopud/1/edit
[09:11:17] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: Thanks! I'll give that a shot
[09:11:21] <fvdjango> Looks much better
[09:15:14] <drakythe> Anyone care to take pity on a rookie syntax issue? http://pastebin.com/jCAgyqCA my code works in jsfiddle, but I wrap it in a $(window).load event and it breaks, obviously I've done sometihng silly...
[09:15:16] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[09:15:40] <BillCriswell> drakythe: function()) should be function()
[09:16:02] <BillCriswell> Line 1.
[09:16:08] <drakythe> rofl
[09:16:11] <systemfault> And it's missing a ); at the end.
[09:16:12] <drakythe> BillCriswell: thank you :)
[09:16:17] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[09:16:19] <drakythe> d'oh!
[09:16:36] <anew> i was going to say wrap it in something else lol
[09:17:02] <BillCriswell> You always triple wrap.
[09:17:24] <FernandoBasso> How do I select something with class 'next' wich is a child of something with id 'pagination'?
[09:17:25] <systemfault> Small suggestion.. try to put the result of selectors in variables if you intend to use them a lot
[09:17:48] <systemfault> FernandoBasso #pagination .next ?
[09:17:57] <drakythe> anew: I'm testing this as a solution to a problem that is occuring when I use $(document).load -- or rather something that equates to that, this was inside of drupal's drupal.behaviors function, but it screws up on reload, so I'm trying to see if a window load will alow refresh to work
[09:18:09] <FernandoBasso> systemfault: Thanks.
[09:18:11] <BillCriswell> It's just a space. If you want an immediate child you use >.
[09:19:24] <FernandoBasso> Okay. Thanks.
[09:20:53] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: It still doesn't seem to be working for me. Do you have a suggestion for trouble shooting?
[09:20:59] <fvdjango> *troubleshooting?
[09:21:39] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: This is what I am using now: http://pastebin.com/zAeycQMc
[09:22:11] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: So I've got one css class .hide and then all of the text is .commitments and some has .hide as well.
[09:22:22] <fvdjango> So the toggle should toggle the hide class
[09:22:28] <anew> drakythe what's the problem that happens with document.load?
[09:22:29] <fvdjango> But the button doesn't seem to be doing anything
[09:23:34] <drakythe> anew: All I'm trying to do is make two blocks of content which have a background color to be the same height, regardless of content, so I'm just comparing them and setting the shorter one to the same height as the taller. On normal load of a page, it works flawlessly, on reload, its 14px short :(
[09:25:57] <nabr0_> fvdjango: not sure what your full code is but the function you have seems to work - http://jsfiddle.net/8t2za/
[09:33:57] <h0m1x> How can I set a default page to be loaded by using load method in jquery? I have been looking for the answer for one day but I didn't find a proper answer to function.Hope someone will answer!
[09:40:41] <Firebalrog> when you do the command git push -u origin master to github master is my local and origin is the github.com repository correct.
[09:42:06] <h0m1x> Did anyone answer?
[09:42:14] <h0m1x> Should share the code?
[09:42:20] <BillCriswell> fvdjango: I was out eating lunch, sorry about that. I don't see anything wrong with your code. Do you get some kind of error?
[09:42:30] <tiphares> what is the actual difference between these two ways of calling a function on an element: https://pastee.org/9ewjc
[09:42:47] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: Can you help me with my damn problem?
[09:43:25] <BillCriswell> Sure, you seem pleasant.
[09:43:27] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[09:44:08] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: http://textsnip.com/0a037b
[09:44:13] <h0m1x> Here is my code
[09:45:05] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: I want to show the first link which has menu_top class to be loaded as a default page in the div called content
[09:45:49] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: The problem is I get the default page when I click anything in the page
[09:46:32] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: and if I don't run the loadDefault() it works fine except no page will be loaded as a default one
[09:46:43] <grafi> probably because you load the default page everytime?
[09:46:48] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: Should I explain more?
[09:47:27] <h0m1x> grafi: But how to prevent it, I'm not a professional Jquery-ist
[09:47:48] <grafi> well its really just logic isnt it?
[09:48:15] <BillCriswell> h0m1x: I am a bit confused by what you're trying to do. You want to load the first off the bat then load whatever it clicked after?
[09:48:18] <grafi> figure out when you want to load the default page and when you dont
[09:48:45] <grafi> and only loadDefault() when you want to have the default page
[09:49:13] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: I want to load the default page when the user loaded the page for the first time
[09:49:24] <h0m1x> grafi: ^
[09:51:13] <BillCriswell> http://pastie.org/pastes/5662944/text This should do what You want... I think?
[09:51:13] <h0m1x> grafi, BillCriswell : Any solution? I have the idea but don't know how to implement!
[09:51:21] <BillCriswell> h0m1x: Slow down.
[09:51:36] <BillCriswell> h0m1x: http://pastie.org/pastes/5662944/text
[09:52:54] <FernandoBasso> How to match the element with class of 'next'?. I need to start from ul id='destaque'. https://gist.github.com/4504209
[09:53:19] <BillCriswell> FernandoBasso: $('#destaque .next') You shoudl read up on selectors.
[09:54:08] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: No that is not working
[09:54:56] <BillCriswell> h0m1x: Is there an error?
[09:55:13] <BillCriswell> Also, are you reloading .menu_top?
[09:55:30] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: No ,no error , also when I click the link it doesn't work
[09:55:56] <BillCriswell> h0m1x: Does each link have the class .menu_top on it?
[09:56:20] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: Yes
[09:56:47] <BillCriswell> Are you running the script in the head or the footer?
[09:57:35] <h0m1x> BillCriswell: I imported it in the main page , it's in another file , also I have already checked whether the document is ready
[09:57:43] <BillCriswell> Also, are you loading the menu items again with each click?
[09:58:06] <fvdjango> BillCriswell: Would there be any reason this JS wouldn't work if it was inside of a Twitter Bootstrap tabbed jquery section?
[09:59:32] <nabr0_> fvdjango: is the click event not working or is the toggle not working"?
[10:00:12] <BillCriswell> h0m1x: http://jsbin.com/aqafab/1/edit
[10:00:55] <BillCriswell> I used .html() instead of .load() but the code I gave you should do the trick.
[10:00:58] <fvdjango> nabr0_: click event isn't working
[10:01:35] <BillCriswell> fvdjango: It shouldn't matter.
[10:02:10] <foo> I have put in several hours on a jquery swipe.js problem and am going crazy. Anyone have a ton of experience with this?
[10:02:27] <h0m1x_> BillCriswell: Sorry I got disconnected , everything is wrong with me today!
[10:02:34] <BillCriswell> h0m1x_: http://jsbin.com/aqafab/1/edit
[10:07:10] <h0m1x_> BillCriswell: Oh!I got the problem , your code was okay, I had imported the jquery code in the main.php too
[10:11:20] <BillCriswell> h0m1x_: Ah.
[10:13:17] <h0m1x_> BillCriswell: One more thing, I have loaded main.php in content div , this main.php has pages like main.php?page=1 , ... I want to call them to be loaded in content div too but when I import the code in them it doesn't work , note that I created anothe file main.js and imported it in main.php
[10:17:52] <BillCriswell> h0m1x_: You would need to run the code on the page when it loads.
[10:18:34] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why ONLY IE is running into errors with the 2nd nested AJAX request? http://pastebin.com/1bs3QiFt
[10:21:20] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: The comma after 8000.
[10:21:46] <BillCriswell> All other browsers forgive that, not IE.
[10:22:08] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: You'll also want to remove the one after the couponcode.
[10:33:23] <DeltaHeavy> BillCiswell: It's not working still, I'm getting: SCRIPT7002: XMLHttpRequest: Network Error 0x80070005, Access is denied.
[10:37:13] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Got disconnected. Lame.
[10:38:08] <BillCriswell> Did you figure out your issue?
[10:38:14] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: No worrys, the removal of the commas didn't help. I'm getting this error BTW: SCRIPT7002: XMLHttpRequest: Network Error 0x80070005, Access is denied.
[10:38:32] <t432> anybody familiar with the plugin?  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[10:38:36] <codepython7771> I've a table with checkboxes as a column. How do i read the values of the checkboxes and their row numbers in an array? Is there a sample of this somewhere I could see?
[10:39:09] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Sounds dirty.
[10:39:38] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: That bad =X?
[10:39:46] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: I have no clue.
[10:40:11] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Restart your browser? I do that and it fixes shit on occasion.
[10:40:28] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: It's happening for a lot more people than just me sadly lol
[10:43:06] <BillCriswell> Damn connection keeps cutting out.
[10:43:11] <BillCriswell> Evil comcast.
[10:44:02] <BillCriswell> codelahoma: You can use .map.
[10:45:18] <BillCriswell> codelahoma: Sorry about that, wrong nick.
[10:51:21] <DeltaHeavy> BillCiswell: .map for me?
[10:51:53] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: i think he was directing that at codepython7771
[10:53:45] <adaviaa> hi.. anyone knows why this is not working http://jsfiddle.net/4XZMb/1177/
[10:56:50] <jost> adaviaa, what exactly does not work?
[10:56:57] <acidjazz> i need functionality to cut out a head of an image.. automatically or easily.. there anything out therE?
[10:57:05] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: No. It was for codepython7771. I think he left, though
[10:57:10] <pachet> head of an image?
[10:57:27] <adaviaa> jost: the bootstrap effect
[10:57:42] <jost> adaviaa, you mean the tooltip
[10:57:43] <jost> ?
[10:58:04] <voot545> can .data() store jQuery objects?
[10:58:19] <acidjazz> pachet: yea like an image of a person.. need to cut out the head
[10:58:21] <adaviaa> jost:  yes sir
[10:58:29] <voot545> or just simple objects with stringers and numbers
[10:58:29] <Whirl3d> Could someone please give me their opinion of the best autoexpanding textarea plugin for jquery?
[10:59:05] <pachet> voot545: yes, it can
[10:59:16] <jost> adaviaa, it works fine here... is there some specific browser or something where it does not work?
[10:59:20] <pachet> i'd advise not doing that though ;[
[10:59:27] <pachet> there are usually better alternatives
[10:59:36] <adaviaa> jost: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tooltips
[10:59:39] <voot545> hmph
[10:59:40] <voot545> okay
[11:15:38] <jtsternberg> how do i grab the data in key3 if key3 is a variable?
[11:15:38] <jtsternberg> Object {home: Object, key2: Object, key3: Object…}
[11:16:03] <jtsternberg> aka in php it would $myarray[$key]
[11:16:03] <BillCriswell> foo.key3 or foo[key3]
[11:16:18] <BillCriswell> Oh, you want foo[key3]
[11:16:34] <jtsternberg> i want the result of foo[key3]
[11:16:52] <BillCriswell> That's what foo[key3] would be.
[11:16:56] <jtsternberg> but need to find it when var key = key3;
[11:17:10] <jtsternberg> so would it be foo[key]
[11:17:11] <jtsternberg> ?
[11:17:16] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:17:31] <Whirl3d> Sorry, one last time: Can someone tell me which textarea autosizing plugin works best or works at all?
[11:18:03] <BillCriswell> jtsternberg: If you wanted key3 without using a variable it would be foo['key3']
[11:18:27] <jtsternberg> your suggestion worked. I thought I was trying that, but must've had the syntax incorrect
[11:18:39] <BillCriswell> jtsternberg: Happens.
[11:25:39] <Whirl3d> fyi the autosize plugin from http://www.jacklmoore.com/autosize  seems to work just fine once you get the url to google's jquery cdn to load correctly.
[11:35:03] <tiphares> what is the actual difference between these two ways of calling a function on an element: https://pastee.org/9ewjc
[11:38:12] <ravenzz> ?click @ tiphares
[11:38:13] <bot-t> tiphares, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[11:38:25] <ravenzz> read the doc :)
[11:38:26] <Firebalrog> 209.58.245.226
[11:38:38] <Firebalrog> disregard
[11:39:16] <Firebalrog> wrong window
[11:39:17] <tiphares> i read the doc but i didn't understand the difference in notation. i'm not talking about "click" specifically
[11:39:23] <tiphares> ravenzz
[11:39:40] <tiphares> both get the job done, most of the time
[11:40:07] <ravenzz> really "In the first two variations, this method is a shortcut for .bind("click", handler), as well as for .on("click", handler) as of jQuery 1.7"
[11:41:45] <ravenzz> tiphares I would suggest you to use on()
[11:42:05] <ravenzz> always... because it supports event delegation
[11:43:32] <tiphares> hm
[11:43:42] <tiphares> i see
[11:46:42] <tiphares> is it considered abuse to always bind ".on()" to document? my guess would be yes, i suppose
[11:47:38] <ravenzz> well the more specific is the selector the better
[11:59:20] <noregret> when I use the arrow keys to go up/down in a <select> change() event doesn't get fired, why ? what other event can I use for that
[11:59:57] <tiphares> keypress()?
[12:01:19] <tiphares> i get it now btw ravenzz, thanks!
[12:02:43] <kripster> evening people, i have a simple question about css styling, i am using the following example http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/23/, now if instead of styling each time i want to change a button i want to go into the jquery mobile css and change the default
[12:03:39] <kripster> changing .ut-btn  in the default stylesheet will change the default size but how do I find which one to edit as the style sheet is huge?
[12:05:29] <kripster> any ideas?
[12:10:12] <kripster> its quiet 2night?
[12:11:47] <kripster> worked it out, thx anyways
[12:11:48] <kripster> lol
[12:19:06] <Nece228> hi, is it possible to select parent this?
[12:19:40] <Nece228> something like $(this).parent()
[12:22:12] <RohanBhangui> how do u make a slide up and fadein function runn at the same time
[12:28:52] <Ziggy`> if I use $('<div />', { html : 'Hello World', css : { color : 'red' }) How can I export/output this to a string?
[12:29:33] <mouses> i have <a href="#"></a> that has click event handlers in my jquery. i want to prevent the page from jumping to the top when clicking the link.... i tried using event.preventDefault ? event.preventDefault() : event.returnValue = false;           -- but that works in chrome/safari on my mac, but not FF
[12:30:11] <mouses> do i have to return false at the end of my function too?
[12:30:18] <mouses> or is this overkill or what?
[12:30:28] <mouses> i want it to be concise
[12:31:10] <Ziggy`> Tried using event.preventDefault(); just?
[12:31:33] <Ziggy`> why the check.
[12:31:36] <mouses> well IE doesnt use preventDefault()
[12:31:40] <vec3_t> shweet
[12:32:16] <mouses> that block of code is so that IE will work (i havent tested IE yet tho)
[12:32:27] <mouses> based on research, thats the way to prevent it in IE
[12:35:23] <Nece228> is there a channel for jquery ui?
[12:36:13] <Ziggy`> mouses: IF you want to use your method, are you sure your using the global event.
[12:37:35] <mouses> hmm, just realized the scope might be wrong
[12:37:39] <mouses> let me retry
[12:37:50] <Ziggy`> mouses: Try window.event.returnValue = false at beginning of code, then do after if(event.preventDefault) { event.preventDefault(); }
[12:39:09] <Ziggy`> mouses: Or try e = $.event.fix(e); in the beginning of the function.
[12:40:46] <mouses> i realized my prob, i used event.preventDefault() but  my click function used the local var "e" as the argument
[12:40:51] <mouses> thanks for the hint
[12:41:21] <Ziggy`> Ah
[12:41:27] <Ziggy`> You can as well do it like this afaik.
[12:41:27] <Ziggy`> mouses: http://pastie.org/5664020
[12:41:46] <farmdawgnation> Hey folks, I'm having some issues with jQuery.html appearing to not run a script before throwing it away when embedding into the DOM in jQuery 1.7.2. I'm about to start digging into this in the actual jQuery code, but I'm wondering if any of you guys have seen this issue. So, anyone seen it?
[12:42:11] <farmdawgnation> For reference, this is a script that's on a page loaded via jQuery.load that isn't running.
[12:42:29] <Ziggy`> mouses: But good that it works now then.
[12:45:04] <fatguylaughing> So I'm reading on $(document).ready() and saw this "Everything inside it will load as soon as the DOM is loaded and before the page contents are loaded." I'm trying to get two divs to always be the same height regardless of the content inside. So if the first one is bigger than the second div, I change the height of the second to the same as the first and vice versa.
[12:45:23] <fatguylaughing> Currently the size does get changed but its not the right height.
[12:45:24] <mouses> thanks Ziggy`  i'll stick to my fix of the local variable for now
[12:45:35] <fatguylaughing> I'm wondering if this is because I have an image in one div and not in the other.
[12:45:54] <fatguylaughing> Should I be using $(document).ready() for this?
[12:46:03] <relipse> what is the best way to display a message to the user after an ajax has completed (some sort of fade out message)?
[12:48:25] <noregret> relipse: I use this, $('.msgs').empty().append("<span>Nothing found!</span>").hide().fadeIn('slow').children('span').addClass('fail_msg').delay(1000).fadeOut('slow'), pretty big though :)
[12:50:31] <alaing> Hi guys I'm trying to help a friend of mine. They are having problems with Office 2010. They originally had Office 2010 Starter Edition on their new machine. I then installed basic Office 2003 and Outlook 2000 until they had enough money to purchase as new Office Home and Business product key. When they open outlook it complains that their no email program associated to perform the action....
[12:50:33] <alaing> ...They are using window 7 home prem edition. I have used the "Default programs" option on the start menu and outlook has tick in its "make outlook the default program". I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and the same thing happened. Any ideas?

[12:51:22] <ADR> Hello I have a weird problem, I define my function. and it works. and runs. But right where I run the function it displays the text "undefined". what does that mean?
[12:51:34] <alaing> whoops sorry
[12:51:55] <shoky> ADR: if you're running it from the console, that's fine. it's showing you the return value of the function
[12:52:06] <idlesysop> fatguylaughing: document ready fires when the dom is loaded, this doesn't include images, so, if you're getting the height of the div before the image is loaded, your height will not include the height of the image...
[12:52:18] <basic6> i'm looking for something that'll fix a table header and allow sorting. i've tried the fixedtableheader plugin which seems to do the job, but how do i add a hook, i.e. call a funtion when the table has been sorted?
[12:52:20] <shoky> ADR: just like if you type 'x' it'll show you the value of x
[12:52:33] <ADR> ahah!
[12:52:41] <idlesysop> unless you explicitly set the height attribute or in css
[12:52:52] <ADR> so I need to do return = ""; so it doesnt display it?
[12:53:16] <shoky> ADR: no, it'll show you the return value no matter what, if you run it from the console..
[12:53:26] <shoky> if you return "";  it'll show you the empty string
[12:53:52] <shoky> ADR: it shouldn't matter, cause the console is only for debugging anyway..
[12:54:16] <ADR> what do you mean by console
[12:54:19] <waspinator> how could I use jquery to get the value of an arbitrary data- attribute?
[12:54:20] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/cJngT/
[12:54:22] <fatguylaughing> idlesysop: Any suggestions on how to make this work. The content is dynamic and the user has the ability to change the image. I don't want to pin them down to only a certain size.
[12:54:30] <shoky> ADR: where are you running the function from
[12:54:54] <ADR> lmao
[12:55:07] <ADR> I just ran it in chrom without a firebug up and it went away
[12:55:18] <shoky> chrome has a console too..
[12:55:24] <relipse> noregret: wow thanks for the code, i'm about to try it
[12:55:45] <ADR> nevermind it was because I typed "return ''"
[12:56:02] <shoky> ;s
[12:56:13] <idlesysop> fatguy: try using window.onload, it won't fire until all your elements have loaded, including scripts
[12:56:14] <noregret> when I use the arrow keys to go up/down in a <select>, the change() event doesn't get fired, why ? what other event can I use for that
[12:56:17] <ADR> Is that the appropriate way to get it to not display on my webpage?
[12:56:29] <shoky> ADR: no, you are not getting it.
[12:56:42] <shoky> ADR: it shouldn't display anything if you're not running it FROM THE CONSOLE
[12:56:51] <shoky> no matter what you return
[12:57:05] <ADR> what do you mean from the console? I just open my browser and goto the website.
[12:57:16] <relipse> noregret: what is the html look like for that?
[12:57:18] <shoky> then where the hell are you seeing "undefined"
[12:57:34] <ADR> where I call my function.
[12:57:38] <relipse> <div class="msgs"></div>? i need it to pop up in the center of the screen
[12:57:42] <shoky> ADR: where, physically
[12:57:49] <shoky> on the screen, where is that text
[12:57:58] <ADR> on my webpage inside a div
[12:58:05] <shoky> then you have a bug.
[12:58:19] <shoky> and can forget everything i said ;]
[12:58:31] <ADR> when I type return "" it goes away.
[12:58:41] <ADR> is that ok to do?
[12:58:46] <shoky> eh.
[12:58:55] <shoky> probably not? i dont know what function youre talking about
[12:59:00] <shoky> and what youre displaying in your div

[12:59:13] <ADR> May I pastebin for you?
[12:59:21] <shoky> you may
[12:59:22] <noregret> relipse: yeah, that div should be there to append messages.. but you can do whatever you want
[12:59:24] <relipse> does anyone know of a jquery message box that fades out (after ajax i need a "Item Saved" message)
[12:59:42] <relipse> noregret: how do i get it to pop up in exact center of screen
[13:00:06] <noregret> relipse: css? or maybe the jquery-ui dialog ?
[13:00:06] <shoky> ADR: something in your code is putting text into the div, is that what you want, or not?
[13:01:46] <relipse> noregret: hmm
[13:04:57] <ADR> I left some notes in here aswell http://pastebin.com/m1cV4EL6
[13:05:13] <ADR> located where it says README in two spots
[13:05:29] <ADR> to help you find where I call the function
[13:06:34] <ADR> shoky my function displays text in the div, that is what I want. but where I call the function is also puts in there the word "undefined" righ tbefore it loads my function text below it.
[13:07:55] <krisfremen> well.. this is weird
[13:08:05] <krisfremen> .ajax call works in firefox and chrome, but not in IE
[13:08:27] <krisfremen> any directions as to why it won't work for a subdomain call?
[13:09:17] <flat_er__> hi guys! i want to change all divs into input type when i click the edit button. do someone of u can give me an approach? =)
[13:09:52] <ADR> shoky: still around?
[13:11:08] <flat_er__> please? =)
[13:11:10] <relipse>  how do i center a div in the absolute center of the window no matter how far down it is scrolled?
[13:11:10] <shoky> ADR: you're doing $(commentTarget).append(eachComment(obj,commentTarget));
[13:11:29] <shoky> ADR:  you're appending the return value of eachComment(..)  into the commentTarget element
[13:12:06] <shoky> ADR:  your code is all messed up.. but try changing that line to just:  eachComment(obj,commentTarget);
[13:12:21] <shoky> ADR: because eachComment() already does the appending inside, it seems.. and doesnt return shit
[13:12:51] <therealklanni> !p

[13:14:27] <ADR> I like to learn the basics and dive in and do research on the internet. It's only when I've been stuck for an hour or so that I goto a chat channel
[13:14:45] <shoky> well just so you know, you're doing things pretty backwards
[13:14:54] <ADR> What do you mean?
[13:15:02] <shoky> i dont have time to get into it, gotta go
[13:15:13] <shoky> will be back in a few hrs\
[13:15:47] <ADR> wait one last question what did you mean by  but try changing that line to just:  eachComment(obj,commentTarget);  change it to what?
[13:15:54] <shoky> to that.
[13:16:14] <ADR> oh add a ";" onto the end
[13:16:16] <shoky> no

[13:20:10] <ilian> hi, is there a way to show some "results" in jquery autocomplete before the ajax response?
[13:22:40] <NoiseEee> the ajax response is providing the results isnt it?
[13:23:15] <chrisbolton_> I'm trying to trigger an event when someone clicks out of a modal window. How would I do that?
[13:26:23] <ilian> NoiseEee, yes, but I want to show some "default" results before this
[13:26:42] <NoiseEee> so you'd really be searching twice?
[13:26:55] <NoiseEee> once through a pre-defined object and once via XHR, ilian?
[13:29:11] <fatguylaughing> idlesysop: So are <p> tags part of the DOM? because I have done this before and don't remember having images in either of my divs.
[13:29:27] <tomasm-> can anyone recommend a widget that will simulate a dropdown but allow for better styling of the objects, specifically for font selection with actual previews in the dropdown?
[13:29:54] <NoiseEee> http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/ @ tomasm-
[13:30:15] <ilian> NoiseEee, not exactly, it is an author search by names, and the default option is "create new author" and it should be visible all the time
[13:30:39] <idlesysop> yes, p tags are part of the dom
[13:30:49] <ilian> even if you type a single letter, also during the search there should be a loading icon too (like in facebook)
[13:30:57] <idlesysop> just use a purse css solution, much better than modifying the dom and doesn't cause fouc
[13:31:12] <idlesysop> http://dabblet.com/gist/4505795
[13:31:56] <tomasm-> NoiseEee, seems nice, but i'm having a bit of trouble finding how to add a custom style for each row
[13:32:05] <NoiseEee> ilian: basically you just want to always display a result that is "create new option"; i'm not that familiar with the hooks of autocomplete so i cant help you further sorry
[13:32:25] <ilian> thanks for the try anyway
[13:40:54] <draginx> Is there a way to convert a data string / querystring into JSON?
[13:45:54] <nickelnick> jsonencode?
[13:47:17] <nickelnick> oops this is jquery channel not php ahha
[13:48:07] <NoiseEee> a "data string" ?
[13:48:18] <danheberden> draginx: i'm sure one exists, but you'd have to parse it yourself
[13:48:27] <NoiseEee> you mean like a=b&c=d and get {"a":"b","c":"d"} ?
[13:48:44] <danheberden> you could probably take most of the parsing i do in https://github.com/danheberden/serializeObject
[13:48:59] <danheberden> and apply it to a split string instead of form element
[13:49:06] <draginx> danheberden: thanks! :)
[13:49:08] <danheberden> or add that functionality and tests and submit a PR
[13:49:44] <kripster> dopey question but how can i position this button, say down 5px? http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/29/#
[13:50:42] <danheberden> kripster: http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/31/
[13:51:05] <tomasm-> NoiseEee, with Select2, does the formatResult callback determine how to style/manipulate the option?
[13:51:25] <kripster> danheberden:legend, thx
[13:53:58] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: i have no idea, you'd have to read the documentation.
[13:54:18] <tomasm-> NoiseEee, yeah its just LOOOOOOONG...haha. thanks

[13:58:12] <loincloth> hi all
[13:59:24] <loincloth> do any general responses come to mind for why i might be getting excessive 'mouseleave' events triggered for an element? i have what seems like a simple case of a div with a 'mouseleave' handler.. moving my pointer off the elemtn, i'm seeing hundreds of events generated
[14:01:30] <Mewster> Hello, I have a question about JQueriUI. Is there a method to get info about the items that are being sorted?
[14:03:59] <Mewster> Hello, I have a question about JQueriUI. Is there a method to get info about the items that are being sorted?
[14:06:27] <ilian> I have an autocomplete, how can I get the autocomplete object if I have the id of the autocomplete
[14:06:48] <ilian> in the autocomplete object I mean the one with the resizeMenu method
[14:11:54] <chrisbolton_> Trying to get a dom element to not move. Even if I try scrolling. Any ideas?
[14:12:20] <NoiseEee> css fixed positioning?
[14:12:38] <chrisbolton_> I tried position:fixed
[14:12:46] <chrisbolton_> It's still scrolling.
[14:13:00] <NoiseEee> fiddle it up
[14:14:02] <chrisbolton_> I should also add that I'm dealing with a body element and then a div element in the body. I'm trying to get the div element to scroll while keeping the body from not moving.
[14:14:09] <chrisbolton_> I'm fiddling it up.
[14:15:09] <NoiseEee> well thats probably not going to work
[14:15:16] <NoiseEee> i don't think you can fix position of body
[14:15:28] <NoiseEee> but certainly a wrapper
[14:15:40] <NoiseEee> <body><div id='pageWrapper'> //etc  </div></body>
[14:16:01] <NoiseEee> but lets see a fiddle that might explain your intentions a little better
[14:16:11] <chrisbolton_> I'm trying to do something where I I've got a bunch of pictures. I click on the picture which brings up a modal. I want to scroll the modal and the content in and keep the background fixed.
[14:16:33] <chrisbolton_> I need go down the dom and select something more accessible than the body?
[14:18:33] <sayd> will .on('click' calls fire before navigating away? i'd like to do a GA _trackEvent
[14:19:18] <NoiseEee> chrisbolton_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5485244/jquery-simplemodal-disable-scrolling
[14:19:30] <NoiseEee> basically overflow:hidden will make it unscrollsable
[14:19:37] <chrisbolton_> NoiseEee : http://jsfiddle.net/eXgJv/ This is a terrible example because it's such a minimal data set.
[14:20:11] <NoiseEee> yeah, just change the "overflow" style of <body> at the appropriate time
[14:21:50] <chrisbolton_> Thanks NoiseEee. I'll start playing.
[14:46:50] <greengriminal> can someone please give me a hand with a small issue
[14:49:42] <tw2113> *chops off his hand*
[14:56:55] <tiphares> any obvious reason why this isn't working? https://pastee.org/tpcjf
[14:57:46] <tiphares> what i'm trying to do is to make a hashtable of all the $(this) elements and store their values for later
[14:58:49] <danheberden> ?eval String( $('<div>') )
[14:58:52] <bot-t> danheberden: "[object Object]"
[14:58:59] <danheberden> tiphares: all of your object keys are that ^
[14:59:14] <tiphares> well shit
[14:59:15] <danheberden> you can't hash objects like that
[14:59:39] <tiphares> don't they have a unique identifies like other languages?
[14:59:49] <tiphares> identifier*
[15:00:05] <danheberden> no - you could add one but i think your implementation would be better without that
[15:00:24] <tiphares> how do you solve stuff like this in js then?
[15:00:27] <danheberden> in that function you're creating on line 11
[15:00:41] <tiphares> btw there's a bug with the variable names in that mockup
[15:01:13] <tiphares> https://pastee.org/8tarf
[15:01:16] <tiphares> correct one
[15:02:08] <danheberden> tiphares: you could just do somethign like this https://pastee.org/96qez
[15:02:14] <danheberden> and let scope do what you want
[15:02:47] <danheberden> or save the original text on the element using see ?data
[15:02:47] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:02:50] <danheberden> whatevs
[15:03:40] <tiphares> oh i was looking for something like that
[15:08:53] <greengriminal> How would I find the correct dialog that corresponds to a <td> that was clicked. http://jsfiddle.net/QL7rK/
[15:09:05] <greengriminal>  I am trying to to register the event on the tables its self. So that when the row that has been clicked it can be accessed via the event
[15:10:16] <tiphares> danheberden data() worked like a charm, thanks a lot!
[15:33:00] <rakl> if I'm submitting a POST request with ajax, is there any reason to wrap a bunch of input elements in form?
[15:33:34] <systemfault> What?
[15:34:55] <rakl> i guess this isn't a strict jquery question… For form submission, if I'm sending data over the wire with an ajax function, do I still need a form? Or can I just have a bunch of input elements and grab their values
[15:36:35] <danheberden> rakl: a form will help in that a) you can simply bind to the submit event and b) users can submit the form with enter in the text box AND a submit button
[15:36:44] <therealklanni> Say I want to capture an AJAX call before it goes out and modify the response object that gets sent to any callback... which might fit better, ajaxPrefilter or ajaxTransport?
[15:36:46] <therealklanni> I
[15:37:02] <danheberden> prefilter
[15:37:27] <danheberden> return a new promise that acts on the resolution of the original jqXHR
[15:37:30] <shoky> damn, you typed what i was typing, word for word
[15:37:33] <shoky> @dan
[15:37:35] <therealklanni> I'm leaning more toward transport because I'm not only dealing with options and I can't predict what callback would be fired (done, fail, always)
[15:37:51] <danheberden> i know there is a example of it that julian wrote up somewhere
[15:38:07] <danheberden> therealklanni: yeah, but if you return a new promise you can handle it however you want
[15:38:36] <rakl> hmm, I see. where would I do that in an $.ajax function though?
[15:38:50] <therealklanni> ok
[15:39:00] <therealklanni> That's what I'm looking for
[15:39:53] <therealklanni> Basically, I'm improving on this https://github.com/paulirish/jquery-ajax-localstorage-cache
[15:42:50] <therealklanni> So what you're saying is that I do a return from the function passed to ajaxPrefilter right?
[15:43:32] <danheberden> therealklanni: you can pass in a new promise into the jqXHR
[15:43:36] <danheberden> lemme see if i can find the code snippet
[15:44:16] <therealklanni> Just trying to understand because this was originally written to only accept a success function as an option parameter, but I'm trying to make it compatible with $.ajax(..).done(...) for instance
[15:44:37] <danheberden> therealklanni: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/stop-a-deferred-callback-queue-in-progress#14737000002190163
[15:45:08] <danheberden> so you create a new promise around the jqXHR
[15:45:08] <danheberden> so that those methods still work
[15:45:22] <danheberden> you're just wrapping it in a new one that you can resolve/reject manually and with your own stuff
[15:46:46] <therealklanni> I think you've missed something, but you're on the right track. The purpose of jquery-ajax-localstorage-cache is to abort the request if the request had been made within X hours already
[15:47:19] <danheberden> i'm just sharing the mechanism
[15:47:22] <therealklanni> However, like I said, it only supports passing a success callback as the value of the "success" property of the setup object
[15:47:42] <therealklanni> I'm just trying to see if we're on the same page
[15:48:02] <danheberden> you can easily reject the deferred in that case
[15:48:03] <danheberden> right then and there even
[15:48:03] <danheberden> or resolve it manually and abort the call
[15:48:03] <danheberden> and the end-point of the application will never know
[15:48:22] <danheberden> well, i'm sure there will be some code bending on your part :)
[15:48:34] <therealklanni> Because you were talking about handling the response. Mainly what I need to do is prevent the request altogether in some cases and but trigger the callback still with cached data
[15:48:37] <danheberden> i'm just sharing the mechanism of controlling an ajax request's promise with a prefilter
[15:49:00] <therealklanni> ok
[15:49:13] <danheberden> i have another thing for you therealklanni
[15:49:13] <danheberden> if gist.github.com will load
[15:49:23] <therealklanni> ok
[15:50:27] <danheberden> god going through gists now is awful
[15:50:27] <therealklanni> I think I understand though. You're saying setting up this deferred will override the original jqXHR deferred, so that if I reject/resolve it within my prefilter, it will trigger a done callback (example) that was attached using the fluent syntax
[15:50:48] <danheberden> therealklanni: https://gist.github.com/1641098
[15:51:51] <therealklanni> Am I understanding you correctly?
[15:52:14] <therealklanni> If so I think I can figure out the details on my own, just needed someone to point me in the right direction :)
[15:52:43] <tds5016> hi. Is there a way to bruteforce the screen to rerender in jquery?
[16:13:44] <rakl> How would I grab the selected radio buttons out of a group of radio buttons? Here's my js and html http://pastie.org/5665188
[16:14:34] <rakl> I'm getting groups by $("[name='a]") and $("[name='a] :checked") returns an empty array

[16:51:49] <coldhead> and made your dry lips sing
[16:54:38] <jacks_appendix> It seems that $.ajax is getting larger every release.. why would I use .done(), .fail(), etc over the older callback way of dealing with results?
[16:57:08] <GoSox> how can i scroll the page, in an animated fashion, to a new point? Like clicking on old <a> tag in page links, but animating to the link instead of instantly jumping to them

[17:17:03] <Ogredude> heya folks
[17:18:09] <Ogredude> I'm a bit confused. Given an element, what's the best way to remove all CSS classes from it and add a specified one? Is there an easier way than a $(selector).removeClass() followed by $(selector).addClass("myclass")
[17:18:13] <Ogredude> easier or better

[17:24:18] <mwmnj> The issue is I am using bootstrap
[17:24:49] <mwmnj> And so implementing animate comes with a few quirks
[17:24:59] <mwmnj> Here is my attempt thus far: http://jsbin.com/opalok/3/edit
[17:28:33] <davve> hello. im getting empty string passed to getElementById when i submit my forms in firefox
[17:28:46] <davve> in debug window. why is that?
[17:41:02] <shoky> wat
[17:47:48] <xenaxon> hi. is there any way to slow down DRAGGABLE?
[17:49:33] <xenaxon> is it possible to desyncronize draggable
[17:49:51] <xenaxon> I want to make it advance 1 pixel per 2 pixels of mouse movement
[17:59:22] <grafi> sounds weird xenaxon
[18:00:50] <xenaxon> grafi
[18:00:53] <xenaxon> is it possible?
[18:01:55] <grafi> Well i guess its possible, but probably not without heavy lifting on your side
[18:02:10] <grafi> doenst seem like the kind of thing with an out of the box solution
[18:02:25] <grafi> at least ive never heard of such a thing
[18:02:45] <grafi> not even sure why i would want such behaviour
[18:04:20] <tds5016> hey. is there a way to tell if an overflow:auto has reached the part where it will begin scrolling with jquery?
[18:07:03] <coldhead> tds5016: these all look pretty gross http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2112106/use-jquery-to-detect-container-overflow
[18:07:34] <tds5016> coldhead: part 2 of the question....
[18:07:46] <tds5016> how would I reenable an event after doing e.preventdefault()?
[18:09:00] <coldhead> i don't think you can
[18:09:20] <coldhead> you just try to do the logic so that you prevent the default only when you're sure you want to
[18:10:00] <coldhead> if you know what the default is you can trigger that explicitly
[18:16:10] <Guest77318> coldhead do you know how to program the jquery ui autocomplete
[18:18:21] <coldhead> i do not, Guest77318
[18:18:25] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[18:18:31] <coldhead> have't used autocomplete yet
[18:18:41] <coldhead> do you have some code we can help you with?
[18:19:10] <Guest77318> well is there some way to get it to display like myspaces autocomplete
[18:19:35] <coldhead> got a link to where i can see the myspace effect?
[18:19:50] <Guest77318> of course myspace.com
[18:20:55] <coldhead> like this? http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[18:21:54] <Guest77318> is that working for you
[18:22:17] <coldhead> slow as hell
[18:22:23] <coldhead> but yes
[18:22:30] <coldhead> is that what you mean?
[18:22:41] <Guest77318> darn is it cause im in ubunu linux
[18:22:47] <coldhead> i am on ubuntu linux
[18:23:11] <grafi> like there is an ubuntu windows? :o
[18:23:26] <Bankzilla> no
[18:23:37] <coldhead> maybe she was clarifying in case i didn't know what ubuntu is
[18:23:40] <coldhead> fortunately i've seen the big bang theory
[18:23:44] <coldhead> and heard it referenced
[18:24:35] <grafi> yeah right
[18:24:47] <grafi> they also reference the great windows vista at some point
[18:24:56] <grafi> soooooo
[18:25:22] <Guest77318> so for all of you its working?
[18:26:25] <grafi> yes
[18:26:37] <grafi> not even very slow
[18:26:49] <Guest77318> so its just a bug?
[18:28:30] <Guest77318> nevermind now its working god i just had to refresh the page
[18:28:44] <grafi> ;)
[18:29:19] <Guest77318> so grafi how do you get that to have 4 different email domains
[18:29:58] <grafi> what now?
[18:30:10] <Guest77318> you dont know how?
[18:32:08] <grafi> seems you have lost me
[18:32:22] <Guest77318> how are you lost?
[18:32:43] <coldhead> you need to word your question better
[18:32:58] <Guest77318> ok i tell you from scratch
[18:33:04] <coldhead> "that" and "with" are very ambiguous
[18:34:17] <grafi> you want to autocomplete domains?
[18:34:26] <Guest77318> no
[18:34:34] <Guest77318> have a look at myspace.com
[18:34:37] <Guest77318> type something
[18:35:26] <grafi> you're talking about the new myspace right?
[18:35:52] <Guest77318> yea didnt you have a look at the mainpage autocomplete
[18:36:51] <coldhead> with the remote json datasource, it will show whatever you want
[18:37:05] <coldhead> so if your server sends back autocompletes for 4 different email domains
[18:37:11] <coldhead> jquery will show those 4
[18:38:00] <Guest77318> coldhead you mean the link you gave me
[18:38:17] <coldhead> yes
[18:38:36] <coldhead> it has a code sample that shows you how to set up the jQuery side
[18:38:44] <Guest77318> but thats server side i dont need the s erver for this one tyhis is client based
[18:38:46] <coldhead> the harder part will be returning 4 sets of results
[18:39:14] <coldhead> the myspace one is server based
[18:39:22] <coldhead> which is what i thought you meant
[18:39:28] <coldhead> seeing as you said "like myspace"
[18:39:37] <Guest77318> yes that is
[18:39:53] <grafi> and if you only have the same 4 just take another example where the autocompletes are hardcoded
[18:40:18] <coldhead> grafi++
[18:40:59] <grafi> ReferenceError: grafi is not defined
[18:41:07] <Guest77318> lol
[18:41:13] <coldhead> :)
[18:41:57] <grafi> and if im defined yet it should be NaN shouldnt it? ^^
[18:43:41] <Guest77318> coldhead so you got mad at windows
[18:44:03] <coldhead> not at all, i just like using software made by geeks for geeks
[18:44:10] <coldhead> rather than made my cunts for idiots
[18:44:31] <Guest77318> so windows is not equivalent in your oppinion
[18:45:11] <coldhead> they're clearly not equivalent
[18:45:24] <coldhead> windows doesnt come with ruby and perl and python, for instance
[18:45:31] <grafi> and that sucks
[18:46:02] <grafi> if only i werent too lazy to kill my win7
[18:46:03] <grafi> ^^
[18:46:25] <coldhead> well there's always virtual machines
[18:46:34] <Guest77318> true
[18:46:50] <Guest77318> virtualbox
[18:47:02] <grafi> the idea of starting windows to fire up linux on a virtual machine isnt really appealing to me
[18:47:24] <grafi> especially since my notebook cant really handle it :p
[18:47:42] <grafi> it can but it doesnt feel good
[18:48:13] <coldhead> bodhi linux is quite undemanding
[18:48:20] <coldhead> crunchbang, too
[18:48:38] <coldhead> i don't mind putting up with some slowness for the sake of working in a coders paradise
[18:48:44] <coldhead> and it's nice to still be able to test IE
[18:48:49] <Guest77318> coldhead are you a programmer
[18:49:06] <grafi> well if i would switch, i would switch altogether
[18:49:14] <grafi> and then run windows in a vm ^^
[18:49:37] <grafi> but im really too lazy to bother
[18:49:45] <coldhead> i find linux better behaved in a vm than i do windows
[18:50:00] <Guest77318> if your lazy how come your sitting next to a computer
[18:50:17] <grafi> seeing as im not required to programm anything for ie, i tend to just not bother
[18:50:20] <coldhead> we seem to be getting away from your original point, Guest77318
[18:50:37] <coldhead> if you're not required to code for IE why are you still in windows? :P
[18:51:25] <grafi> well because windows 7 is with the limitations of it being microsoft product a really good os, and ive gotten used to it, have all my software on it etc
[18:51:42] <coldhead> well said
[18:51:50] <coldhead> i haven't even tried windows since 2000
[18:52:12] <LocalPCGuy> XP, 7 and (yes, I'm going there) 8 are all pretty solid
[18:52:19] <coldhead> it still delights me every day to be able to do everything i need with free software
[18:52:31] <grafi> 8 is not a solid product for a desktop/laptop
[18:52:37] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[18:52:48] <LocalPCGuy> use it just fine, faster than Win7 was and works great
[18:52:57] <LocalPCGuy> reviewers are just dumb
[18:53:41] <Guest77318> LOL
[18:53:55] <grafi> ive played around with it ... the not called metro anymore ui sucks hard with a mouse
[18:55:32] <LocalPCGuy> anyone I've talked to that has actually used 8 for a few weeks (at least) likes it just fine, if not better than 7.  It is different, and there is a bit of a learning curve, but works just fine.  Even Metro.  But playing with it for a few minutes isn't enough time
[18:55:56] <grafi> keyword being learning curve
[18:55:58] <LocalPCGuy> which is why I say reviewers are dumb
[18:56:33] <grafi> anyways, i dont like it and i wont try to get to know it better
[18:57:36] <LocalPCGuy> fair enough
[18:57:50] <Guest77318> grafi so your sticking to 7
[18:58:11] <grafi> as long as i can
[18:58:15] <grafi> ;)
[18:58:36] <Guest77318> what about when 10 years past and its depreacted softwar
[18:59:00] <LocalPCGuy> be no different than those hanging on the XP these days
[18:59:05] <grafi> either win9 which following the rules could be good again, or off to linux
[18:59:39] <Guest77318> which linux distro
[18:59:55] <LocalPCGuy> I like Crunchbang, run it on my old laptop
[19:00:33] <grafi> what do I know, probably just plain old ubuntu
[19:01:07] <Guest77318> good choice
[19:01:12] <grafi> cant say i have played around with much else, so that will probably require some figuring out beforehand
[19:03:59] <Guest77318> coldhead what programming languages do youy know
[19:04:28] <grafi> ruby perl and python would be my guess ^^
[19:04:35] <grafi> and javascript ofc ^^
[19:05:01] <Guest77318> grafi are you a programmer
[19:05:10] <coldhead> i know my way around those + a bunch of lisps + horrible horrible php
[19:05:16] <coldhead> but i mostly get paid for JS
[19:05:18] <grafi> lisper
[19:05:45] <coldhead> having the most fun with clojure and perl6 lately
[19:06:33] <grafi> i try to be Guest77318
[19:06:43] <grafi> only time will tell
[19:07:04] <Guest77318> interesting
[19:07:21] <Guest77318> but what i want to implement is php or jquery
[19:07:29] <Guest77318> or both together
[19:07:35] <tds5016> just need to vent real quickly... mobile safari is pretty suckrageous.... it's making it impossible to block scrolling unless a div is filled.
[19:07:53] <tds5016> it INSISTS on requiring the div to be full
[19:08:11] <grafi> ios anything tends to be rather messy in my experience :p
[19:09:39] <LocalPCGuy> wait until you try to pin something to the top/bottom reliably
[19:09:56] <coldhead> tds5016: there is a good summary of issues for different mobile browsers on the jquery mobile github repo
[19:11:12] <tds5016> All I want is rubber-banding to die in a fire....
[19:11:21] <coldhead> truer words, my friend
[19:13:48] <tds5016> is there a way to reenable the touch events after e.preventdefault on them?
[19:25:55] <blar1> running 'npm install' is currently failing with "no compatible version found: grunt-contrib-jshint"... i'm a bit confused by this, as the package page for grunt-contrib-jshint says that it's not ready for release.  why is jquery installation failing when a not-ready for release package is not available?
[19:26:58] <ajpiano> blar1: yikes
[19:27:02] <ajpiano> that sounds strikingly familiar
[19:27:26] <coldhead> ##grunt
[19:27:39] <ajpiano> it might affect us though coldhead
[19:28:01] <coldhead> NOTHING CAN TOUCH ME
[19:28:19] <coldhead> i'm kidding, you boys talk about your little utilities here
[19:28:21] <coldhead> it's fine
[19:28:25] <coldhead> i'm not bothered
[19:28:39] <grafi> because you are not touched
[19:28:39] <Skaag> theoretical question about jQuery mobile
[19:28:42] <grafi> oô
[19:28:56] <Skaag> I want to have a screen with icons, kinda like on iOS
[19:29:08] <Skaag> meaning you can swipe left/right between several screens
[19:29:14] <ajpiano> blar1: did you just clone?
[19:29:17] <Skaag> but still be able to click on the icons to load apps
[19:29:20] <blar1> ajpiano: yes
[19:29:30] <Skaag> is this tricky or easily achievable with jQuery mobile?
[19:29:35] <blar1> can i just clib the contrib dependency from the install script?
[19:30:05] <blar1> line 467 in Gruntfile.js seems to reference it (not at all familiar with grunfiles)
[19:30:19] <ajpiano> blar1: so we're on like a prerelease version of grunt
[19:30:39] <ajpiano> and ben_alman had to make a change that broke some things
[19:30:47] <coldhead> thanks en
[19:30:48] <coldhead> ben*
[19:30:51] <blar1> how do i clone that version of grunt?
[19:30:54] <ajpiano> and some of the contrib modules are in a strange state right now
[19:31:28] <ajpiano> i have to figure it out
[20:24:07] <relipse>  how do i get a div to show up in the center of the view (i'm going to fade it out)
[20:25:48] <coldhead> position: absolute; left: 50%; margin-left: -(half whatever the width is);
[20:26:00] <coldhead> top, margin-top similarly
[20:28:52] <JessC> @coldhead That would put the left part of the div at exactly 50% but it wouldn't be center in relation to the container
[20:29:37] <shoky> JessC: that's what the negative margin-left is for
[20:30:33] <shoky> that, or maybe i misunderstood you
[20:30:33] <coldhead> i have no idea if that works, it's pretty much my first day using position:absolute
[20:33:54] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: do you know if it's possible to read the contents of a comment tag in IE9? Been trying to get it to work and it's killing me. Here's a fiddle if you want to take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/9sU3q/  The content comes through in an alert(), but if you try to console, append, anything… the content doesn't show.
[20:35:06] <coldhead> i don't have IE9 to test
[20:35:37] <coldhead> there was a proof of concept JS template engine which stored the comments in html comments
[20:35:56] <coldhead> i dimly remember it worked by iterating over text nodes
[20:35:59] <coldhead> rather than innerHTML
[20:36:10] <coldhead> but i don't remember the project or the specifics
[20:36:24] <eimajenthat> Okay, a little bit stumped here.  I've got some divs with a common class: $('div.myclass'), but I want to only select the ones that contain an image.  I came up with $('div.myclass img').parent(), which works to an extent, but only if the image is a direct child, not nested inside another 3 or so layers of divs.  Is there a way to select elements which meet a match a CSS selector AND contain an element (somewhere) which matches a
[20:36:25] <eimajenthat> entirely different CSS selector?  And does that make any sense?
[20:36:36] <coldhead> instead i can rely on glibly warning you not do to this because comments are meant to be comments and you're not supposed to access them :P
[20:36:42] <tonyjcamp> Cool, thanks for taking a look. I thought I messed with the actual nodeValue etc, but couldn't seem to get it.
[20:37:22] <tonyjcamp> Totally, but a terrible 3rd party API is returning information in a <!-- that needs to be output on the page :(. Makes me QQ
[20:37:36] <coldhead> that is so awfulm sorry for your loss tonyjcamp
[20:37:52] <tonyjcamp> Thank you sir. I hope to bounce back from it soon.
[20:37:57] <coldhead> ?:has @ eimajenthat
[20:37:57] <bot-t> eimajenthat, :has(selector): Selects elements which contain at least one element that matches the specified selector. http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[20:38:29] <eimajenthat> wow, just wow
[20:39:01] <eimajenthat> that's entirely too easy
[20:39:02] <eimajenthat> thanks
[20:39:14] <coldhead> happy hacking eimajenthat !
[20:40:18] <eimajenthat> thanks, you too
[20:41:08] <greg5green> eimajenthat: $('div.myclass img').parentsUntil('div.myclass');
[20:42:17] <greg5green> although coldhead's method might work better, just not how my brain would have worked
[20:42:30] <tonyjcamp> coldhead: got it working. $('p')[0].childNodes[0].data;
[20:42:42] <tonyjcamp> awfully ugly!
[20:43:47] <coldhead> yes but the whole thing is so awful
[20:43:55] <coldhead> better something ugly and get on with your life
[20:43:56] <tonyjcamp> Totally true.
[20:43:59] <coldhead> well played
[20:44:06] <coldhead> let us never speak of this again
[20:44:13] <coldhead> and a curse upon your third party
[20:44:25] <tonyjcamp> Thanks for reminding me to re-try some nodes ;)
[20:44:38] <eimajenthat> greg5green: His seems prettier, but that parentsUntil thing is sweet.  I've run into many situations where I wanted something like that, and wouldn't have dreamed it existed.
[20:45:08] <JessC> $('div.myclass > img')?
[20:46:11] <eimajenthat> JessC: wouldn't that select the image, rather than the div?
[20:46:15] <greg5green> JessC: that would select the img tag, not the div with a class of myclass that happens to have an img tag somewhere in it
[20:46:32] <JessC> yeah you'd have to go up a parent on that
[20:46:34] <greg5green> or rather, the div that has an img tag directly in it
[20:47:04] <JessC> i don't know if $('div.myclass > img').parent() would select all or just the first occurrence
[20:47:32] <ADR> shoky: you around?
[20:47:45] <ADR> I think I figured out why you said I was doing it all backwards.
[20:47:59] <greg5green> it would select most, but doesn't work in this case as sometimes those img tags are nested in several divs -- with that selector, it wouldnt select those nested img tags
[20:48:04] <eimajenthat> is there a childrenUntil()?
[20:48:15] <shoky> ADR: hy
[20:48:21] <eimajenthat> .closest() looks like it might do
[20:49:02] <ADR> Because I was passing the json variables as single "words" i guess you could say. then building the Comment/post on the jquery side instead of passing a whole comment already made from the php side.
[20:49:34] <greg5green> eimajenthat, no there isn't
[20:49:42] <ADR> Was that anywheres close?
[20:49:44] <ADR> lols
[20:49:53] <greg5green> some combination of closest, find, and filter could work depending on exactly what you are trying to do
[20:50:34] <ADR> I'm going to fix it tommarow. I didnt know you could pass a large amount of text as a json value.
[20:50:52] <ADR> I thought they had to be small things like a single word.
[20:51:12] <ADR> when using json_encode(); on the php end.
[20:52:51] <ADR> I just looked at a posting/commenting tutorial. And noticed the guy built the HTML Post on the PHP side, THEN passed it as a json value with json_encode(); and displayed it then.
[21:02:57] <shoky> ADR: i donno if "backwards" was the right word.. but having lots of html in your javascript is very messy and prone to errors, consider using a templating library. serving up the html from your php as you're now describing is of course fine too and it's prolly the most common way, but there's definitely a shift towards client-side templating similar in gist to what you were doing
[21:04:16] <shoky> that might've been total baloney, im not too sober sry ;p
[21:05:40] <shoky> and by serving html from your php i meant proper html, not html wrapped in json
[21:06:01] <shoky> tho there's nothing inherently wrong with that i suppose
[21:06:30] <shoky> -
[21:06:34] <shoky> woops
[21:11:57] <bricker> I know this is a common problem, but I can't think of how to solve it: I have a script that finds elements with a certain class and modifies them on page load. Then I have a link that adds more elements of the same type, but the script doesn't modify those new elements.
[21:12:11] <bricker> What's the best way to make the script also pick up any new elements added to the page?
[21:12:25] <shoky> what do you mean by modify?
[21:13:14] <bricker> shoky: in my specific case, it hides the element and builds a new input with a datepicker and some other fancy UI stuff
[21:13:35] <bricker> shoky: but it could be something simple like applies a border color
[21:13:52] <shoky> seems like you'd need to just run it against any new elements you're adding, right after you've added them
[21:14:08] <shoky> there's no way to "pick up" on new elements being added. at least not yet
[21:14:32] <bricker> shoky: yeah, I could do that, but I was hoping there was a less "manual" way in place. No problem
[21:14:35] <shoky> if it was just about setting an event handler on them, then there's a good solution fo rthat
[21:15:28] <bricker> I guess the easiest solution would be to make the input modifier script into a simple jquery plugin
[21:15:40] <Aqeel> hi everyone
[21:15:55] <Aqeel> why am i getting *** is not a function in console
[21:15:59] <Aqeel> error
[21:16:15] <Aqeel> it is within froma  plugin
[21:16:38] <shoky> Aqeel: you're trying to call a function.. that isn't one
[21:16:48] <shoky> like.. var x = 5;  x();
[21:17:42] <Aqeel> $.fn.abc= function (selector, fn, delay) { }; .... is this a function??
[21:17:55] <shoky> yep
[21:18:40] <Aqeel> then element.abc(function () { return FR(this, "f", s); }); gives error
[21:18:53] <shoky> fiddle.
[21:19:00] <shoky> also.. what is element
[21:19:10] <Aqeel> call within the plugin..
[21:19:25] <shoky> ?

[21:20:20] <shoky> fiddle.
[21:20:28] <Aqeel> it is complex..
[21:20:31] <shoky> indeed
[21:20:45] <shoky> all the more reason for a fiddle
[21:21:27] <shoky> or do you expect someone to actually go through this cryptic code?
[21:21:44] <Aqeel> no i can take you to error
[21:21:54] <Aqeel> and explain..
[21:22:16] <Aqeel> no need to go through all that stuff
[21:22:28] <shoky> then dont put it in the fiddle
[21:22:39] <shoky> think of the fiddle as the explanation.
[21:22:52] <Aqeel> ok let me break it down..
[21:23:11] <Aqeel> and remove that is not elated to error
[21:25:37] <shoky> you can put the whole thing in the fiddle if you want
[21:25:48] <shoky> reproduce the error
[21:31:03] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZjgJq/
[21:31:53] <Aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com/advance.html
[21:31:59] <Aqeel> run your console
[21:32:08] <Aqeel> click forward
[21:32:24] <shoky> USE OTHER BROWSERS
[21:32:24] <shoky> SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION
[21:32:40] <shoky> and the fiddle says: Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[21:32:46] <shoky> reproduce it in the fiddle man
[21:33:18] <Aqeel> ok let me make a proper case...
[21:35:24] <shoky> Aqeel: why are you returning something from inside the mousepressed callback
[21:35:54] <Aqeel> its returning back the instance
[21:36:06] <shoky> returning it where?
[21:36:17] <shoky> that returns from that callback, not from fastforward()
[21:36:28] <shoky> fastforward returns undefined, always
[21:36:51] <shoky> (talking about the return in line 132 in your fiddle)
[21:37:38] <shoky> your 'get' function is also weird
[21:39:18] <GoSox> so what are we supposed to use these days, insead of .click() ?
[21:40:07] <Aqeel> get was not mine but from original creator, i agree it is weird... and for returning , it returns to the fr function
[21:40:36] <shoky> wat?
[21:41:06] <shoky> GoSox: .click() is fine  and does exactly the same thing as .bind('click', function..    and .on('click', function..
[21:41:31] <GoSox> i thought someone told me i should use .on("click" instead of .click()
[21:41:59] <shoky> they do exactly the same thing. .on can be used in more ways though
[21:42:09] <shoky> if you pass a selector as 2nd argument
[21:42:16] <shoky> then it does event delegation
[21:42:24] <GoSox> so .click() isn't deprecated or anything?
[21:42:39] <shoky> nope
[21:42:47] <Aqeel> no if click is not there how will mouse function...
[21:43:00] <shoky> ..
[21:43:04] <GoSox> well in that case, .click() makes much prettier code than .on() for simple click detection
[21:43:12] <Aqeel> yes
[21:43:30] <Aqeel> even in documentation thewy have mentioned it out
[21:43:35] <Aqeel> they*
[21:43:42] <shoky> some would argue that it makes for less descriptive code
[21:44:07] <GoSox> shoky: i'm good at ignoring arguments i don't agree with
[21:44:18] <shoky> why wouldn't you agree with it ;]
[21:44:36] <shoky> i said descriptive, i didn't say prettier or better
[21:49:44] <Whirl3d> Good evening Shoky and everybody
[21:50:20] <wabism> sup
[21:50:49] <Whirl3d> to create a simple button using jquery ui's css, I just have to enclose a span element of class="ui-icon ui-icon-theicon" inside an anchor element, right?
[21:52:02] <Whirl3d> but how do I get the icon (16x16) to be centered  on both axis inside the anchor element? Is there a jquery UI class that handles that or should I ask in #css?
[21:56:01] <LocalPCGuy> Whirl3d you should do that with css
[21:56:11] <b1lly> you should do that with css
[21:56:21] <b1lly> but if you choose, there is a jquery ui plugin .position()
[21:56:35] <b1lly> brb
[21:57:03] <Whirl3d> I was asking more about css in jquery UI...it get's tricky to decipher sometimes and they usually get pissy over at #css about it.
[21:57:18] <coldhead> they get pissy about everything in #css
[21:57:24] <GoSox> yup
[21:57:33] <GoSox> it is what it is
[21:57:49] <Aqeel> shoky, if i log just d(this), it shows the object but if i log the d(this).mousepressed it says type error
[21:58:00] <GoSox> using slideUp() and slideDown() on items fixed to the bottom of the screen, is weird
[21:59:28] <djshotglass> best event to hook when you want to know when an input has changed?
[21:59:49] <shoky> hey Whirl3d
[22:00:02] <shoky> djshotglass: input
[22:00:06] <LocalPCGuy> djshotglass change event
[22:00:57] <shoky> Aqeel: am i supposed to know what d is?
[22:01:02] <shoky> Aqeel: what about the fiddle?
[22:01:56] <Aqeel> ok wait..
[22:02:43] <djshotglass> change doesnt fire until they deselect input
[22:02:48] <djshotglass> isnt there a keypress event
[22:03:14] <LocalPCGuy> you could use keyup
[22:03:33] <GoSox> or keydown
[22:03:42] <shoky> or 'input' like i said , which catches all of those
[22:03:53] <shoky> and pastes and whatnot.
[22:04:00] <GoSox> but isn't input not supported everywhere yet?
[22:04:36] <LocalPCGuy> not well support (buggy in IE9, nothing earlier)
[22:04:46] <LocalPCGuy> err...supported
[22:05:17] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZjgJq/
[22:05:44] <shoky> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[22:05:53] <djshotglass> $('#inputAmount').input(function(){});?
[22:05:59] <djshotglass> doesnt work
[22:06:06] <shoky> .on('input', function..
[22:06:26] <shoky> if you care about IE<9 and maybe ie9, then use other events too
[22:06:38] <coldhead> https://www.google.com.au/search?q=define%3Ajquery
[22:07:03] <coldhead> hey Davey_
[22:07:08] <Davey> Hey coldhead
[22:07:15] <djshotglass> backspace doesnt fire keyup or input
[22:07:17] <djshotglass> dafaq
[22:08:23] <shoky> phew, thanks coldhead
[22:08:42] <coldhead> my pleasure
[22:11:25] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZjgJq/1/
[22:11:34] <Whirl3d> how do you use a cdn for jqueryUI themes?
[22:11:49] <shoky> Aqeel: i dont see any error
[22:12:49] <tw2113> Whirl3d, put the UI themes on a cdn, reference them from that url
[22:13:48] <Whirl3d> I have that setup for the css itself, but the images that it references aren't showing up
[22:14:05] <tw2113> did you check the image paths?
[22:14:26] <tw2113> did you copy over the images?
[22:14:50] <Whirl3d> it's a cdn, I guess I expected them to handle that for me.
[22:14:55] <Whirl3d> Isn't that the point of a cdn?
[22:15:14] <tw2113> i'm asking you to confirm that there are images to be served
[22:16:04] <tw2113> and that the specified paths to the images, if they're there, are correct
[22:18:16] <tw2113> say i have a css file with relative image paths on my server, and i want to put this css file on your server, which is faster
[22:18:29] <tw2113> i can't put just the css on yours and expect the images to work
[22:19:14] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZjgJq/2/
[22:20:19] <shoky> Aqeel: ok.. d(this) is undefined
[22:21:56] <shoky> Aqeel:  uh.. don't you mean $(this).mousepressed... ?
[22:22:06] <Aqeel> yes..
[22:22:16] <Aqeel> i am myself looking as why is this now
[22:22:54] <shoky> suggestion: stop coding in cryptic language..
[22:23:56] <tw2113> no more javaklingon?
[22:24:34] <Aqeel> well i did not use but the original creator i just am working on it to add more functions
[22:25:18] <shoky> that's not an excuse, also i've seen you working with this same cryptic code for months now
[22:25:21] <Aqeel> well i can take the time and reverse engineer it and give proper naming
[22:25:26] <shoky> change the goddamn function/variable names
[22:25:34] <Aqeel> yes, am adding functions to it..
[22:26:19] <Aqeel> original
[22:26:20] <Aqeel> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6266559/jQuery.plugins/Demo.aautoscroll.htm
[22:26:29] <GoSox> one time i used one of those javascript code obfuscators and then i lost the original code. reverse engineering was not fun, nor easy
[22:28:42] <shoky> Aqeel:  https://sites.google.com/site/danielgidmanresume/history/jquery-aautoscroll/jquery.aautoscroll.js?attredirects=0&d=1
[22:30:11] <Aqeel> ??
[22:30:26] <Aqeel> i have and working on this to improve some more functions
[22:30:38] <Aqeel> and did you see what naming he used
[22:31:58] <shoky> he's using cryptic names for some local arguments/variables yeah
[22:32:04] <shoky> but yours had much more
[22:32:29] <Aqeel> ??
[22:32:36] <Aqeel> i just added two methids..
[22:32:48] <shoky> he doesn't have.. FR
[22:32:53] <Aqeel> toend: and edgescroll: .... he has
[22:32:55] <shoky> or d
[22:32:57] <Aqeel> look down
[22:33:00] <shoky> or cE, or uI
[22:33:11] <Aqeel> did you see the entire code
[22:33:22] <shoky> yes
[22:33:31] <shoky> did you look at the last link i posted?
[22:34:12] <shoky> Aqeel: http://pastebin.com/7uYXnqrp
[22:37:55] <Aqeel> but you have removed the main purpose of this plugin..
[22:38:47] <GoSox> does javascript NOT require a ; at the end of a line of code?
[22:39:17] <Aqeel> it remembers its state, and the other small stuff
[22:39:23] <shoky> GoSox: usually no..
[22:39:40] <GoSox> i didn' tknow that
[22:45:22] <shoky> Aqeel: ok, didnt notice its not the same version
[22:50:29] <GoSox> FUCK
[22:50:40] <GoSox> the buggy address bar in Safari 6 is driving me FUCKING INSANE
[23:00:47] <GoSox> oh was the issue with .click() that it only works on existing items, where .on("click" works with dynamically added items too?
[23:01:31] <BinaryKitten> GoSox different syntax
[23:02:10] <BinaryKitten> GoSox $('selector').click(fn)  === $('selector').on('click', fn);
[23:02:15] <BinaryKitten> they are the same
[23:02:45] <BinaryKitten> for dynamically added items, you need to "bind" the click to the closest parent that is there
[23:03:00] <GoSox> example?
[23:03:14] <MoTiOnXml> why don't you google it?
[23:03:17] <BinaryKitten> eg $('containerSelector').on('click', 'selectorforchildren', fn)
[23:03:57] <BinaryKitten> MoTiOnXml because i was explaining the difference to GoSox, so not that far out of the conversation to ask for an example
[23:04:09] <GoSox> and it works great, thanks
[23:04:42] <BinaryKitten> no worries :)
[23:04:45] <GoSox> i'm doing slow-scrolling anchor links, on some long pages, and boy do they make all the difference in the world
[23:05:33] * BinaryKitten has done her morning web check and so goes to get ready for work
[23:13:35] <sshaginyan> How do I jqueryfy an object
[23:43:17] <sacrilicious> hello world
[23:43:50] <sacrilicious> in jquery, what can i use to display an alert box when the enter key is pressed ?
[23:47:58] <sCoRpi_> sacrilicious: use an event listener for the keyup/keydown event, filter out your enter key and then just display an alert box
[23:48:39] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/8tpyE/ sCoRpi_
[23:48:42] <sacrilicious> sCoRpi_: what is the keycode for enter ?
[23:48:59] <sCoRpi_> Aqeel, i don't need that, but thanks ;)
[23:49:07] <Aqeel> sorry ment for sacrilicious
[23:49:11] <sCoRpi_> i know
[23:49:17] <sCoRpi_> sacrilicious: check Aqeel's example
[23:49:19] <Aqeel> click the body pard and press enter
[23:50:28] <Aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/8tpyE/1/
[23:52:09] <sCoRpi_> Aqeel: for which browser do you have the e.which in  there?
[23:53:17] <sCoRpi_> or rather
[23:53:28] <Aqeel> P.S In Firefox, you have to use event.which to get the keycode; while IE support both event.keyCode and event.which.
[23:53:30] <sCoRpi_> where is there going to be a case where e.keyCode isn't going to be set
[23:53:35] <sCoRpi_> aah
[23:53:37] <sCoRpi_> ok
[23:56:13] <Aqeel> TypeError: line is null, codemirror giving error
