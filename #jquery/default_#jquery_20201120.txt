[08:32:58] <ckb> is there a way I can tell when an audio element starts playing?
[12:05:22] <egism> how do you select an element by a unique identifier and get its physical siblings, not identifier siblings?
[12:06:16] <egism> tried $("[data-id=12]").siblings() but as I understand it tries to get siblings of the same selector which is actually unique
[12:07:27] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle showing what you mean?
[12:07:52] <robertmaxrees> because .siblings() gets all direct siblings.
[12:09:23] <robertmaxrees> optionally filtered by a selector egism
[12:23:07] <egism> robertmaxress tried on a jsfiddle, works as it should, somethings wrong with my case then
[12:23:12] <egism> thanks
[12:23:14] <robertmaxrees> show your code :)
[12:24:56] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd avoid selecting on data attributes when possible - behavior can change based on how the data attribute was set.
