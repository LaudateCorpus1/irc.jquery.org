[07:38:15] <tilerendering> hi ppl
[07:41:51] <tilerendering> quick question, I m not so familiar with js: I want to attach a click event handler to all elements of a certain class. like so: $(‘.theClass).on('click', e -> setSomething(e, theElement)); furthermore, in the setSomething function (setSomething(e, theElement) I want to read out  a “data-“ property of the element, and I do it like so: theData = jQuery(elmnt).attr("data-whatever”); what am I doing wrong here?
[08:08:49] <Steveccc> I have a site with a mouse over which adds an overlay (changes opacity) with the title on it. On mobile you have to click to see this title so my thought was to add preventDefault so that the first tap displays the overlay and then you tap again to action the a href. Is there a way to only apply the preventDefault to the first click?
[08:14:22] <tilerendering> figure it out already, thanks anyways for all your help
[09:52:11] <DrJ> can the jquery $.getScript() function replace an already defined function?
[09:53:26] <DrJ> I tried, but didn't work. Says it operates in the global scope
[09:53:32] <DrJ> so I think I should be able to
[10:15:26] <codecutter> Cork around?
[10:15:35] <taplar> good morning jquery
[10:15:49] <codecutter> morning to you too, sire.
[10:15:54] <codecutter> professor!
[10:16:04] <codecutter> jquery professor*
[10:16:06] <codecutter> :)
[10:16:12] <taplar> lol, not necessary.  i'm just a dude
[10:17:20] <codecutter> Cork
[10:17:43] <codecutter> this does not behave as you described https://jsfiddle.net/j3p9skwe/
[10:17:57] <taplar> what's the issue?
[10:19:31] <codecutter> i assumed if positive or negative are checked, server would take the which ever input field is checked.
[10:19:36] <codecutter> this is not the case
[10:19:51] <codecutter> its always neutral on server side
[10:19:59] <taplar> yes, with checkboxes, the ones that are checked are submitted
[10:20:12] <codecutter> hmm
[10:20:14] <taplar> you most likely have an issue with the hidden field having the same name as your checkboxes
[10:21:18] <codecutter> all 3 input share the same name prop 'sentiment'
[10:21:23] <codecutter> ?
[10:21:28] <taplar> right, which doesn't make a lot of sense
[10:21:36] <codecutter> ah!
[10:21:41] <taplar> the checkboxes having the same name, with your exclusion logic, makes sorta sense
[10:21:48] <taplar> the hidden field having the same name doesn't
[10:22:11] <codecutter> i should remove the name prop fro hidden field?
[10:22:26] <taplar> i would.  "neutral" for your case would be neither checkbox being submitted
[10:22:33] <taplar> so the backend would have to check for the absence of it
[10:22:54] <codecutter> can i see a fiddle?
[10:23:08] <taplar> just remove the hidden field.  what's your backend language?
[10:23:14] <codecutter> java
[10:23:45] <taplar> gah, been a while since i did java.  i'm mostly groovy right now.  how do you grab parameters from the request?
[10:23:47] <codecutter> oh i see, what you mean
[10:24:02] <codecutter> nvm
[10:24:04] <codecutter> gotcha
[10:29:03] <taplar> Also, i caught very little of the convo from yesterday, but am I correct in remembering/assuming you're using checkboxes over radio buttons because you want to allow for the neutral state?
[10:35:10] <codecutter> taplar: thats works
[10:35:15] <codecutter> yes
[10:35:42] <codecutter> taplar: you solved that problem
[10:35:50] <codecutter> neutral state is now null
[10:35:53] <codecutter> :)
[10:36:17] <codecutter> if null i set the prop to neutral on the server side
[10:36:21] <codecutter> on*
[10:37:46] <taplar> just to show other possibilities, neutral state could also be done with radio buttons.  for instance: https://jsfiddle.net/xjgcsrvo/
[10:39:18] <codecutter> taplar: none must be an option
[10:39:28] <taplar> none is an option.  click the one that is selected
[10:39:48] <codecutter> aw
[10:40:20] <codecutter> where were you before?
[10:40:29] <taplar> heh, yesterday was a busy day, :)
[10:40:42] <codecutter> and why did Cork not suggest this?
[10:40:48] <taplar> *shrug*
[10:41:04] <codecutter> i need to update my code
[10:41:07] <taplar> it's not that common, from my web experience
[10:41:07] <codecutter> thanks
[10:41:51] <codecutter> can i take the input out of the label?
[10:42:24] <taplar> Sure, though if you do that clicking the text will not change the radio
[10:45:19] <codecutter> its pretty similar to what i'm doing now
[10:46:08] <taplar> though if you wanted to, you could get fancy with it, and also make it nicer for mobile devices at the same time
[10:46:42] <codecutter> hmm
[10:46:57] <taplar> one sec, still take a minute or two to modify to show you
[10:52:08] <taplar> ok, ignore the particular colors, because they suck.  but it demonstrates the concept: https://jsfiddle.net/q8v1spje/
[10:53:11] <codecutter> exactly what i'm trying to do... -:)
[10:55:22] <codecutter> i need to remove the color on hover and voila!
[10:56:20] <taplar> i could have sworn bootstrap already had something for this, minus the logic for the neutral state, but i'm not finding it right now
[10:57:01] <codecutter> i'm not going to import an entire lib for this...
[10:57:11] <codecutter> this will do, thx
[10:57:24] <taplar> k
[13:21:02] <stoned> Hello I have DIV,TD,TR,TBODY,TABLE,DIV,DIV,DIV,TD,TR,TBODY,TABLE,DIV,FORM,DIV,DIV,DIV,DIV,DIV,BODY,HTML. First DIV has id #vendor_orderfromid. I want to be able to select the TR that this particular DIV id is in, and do stuff to that TR
[13:21:23] <taplar> please show us what you got in a fiddle or the like
[13:21:23] <stoned> I can't seem to be able to figure out how to grab that. I tried parents, and iterating over that and I can't seem to grab that TR
[13:21:54] <stoned> I don't think I can replicate the whole table structure there
[13:22:16] <taplar> right click on the table, inspect element, find it in the inspector, then you can copy the html from there
[13:22:18] <stoned> How would you go about selecting a parant/ancestor tag up in the chain.
[13:22:41] <taplar> closest() goes up through ancestors
[13:42:06] <stoned> .closest('tr').hide(); ahh
[13:42:09] <stoned> That was easy.
[13:42:40] <stoned> Ahh
[13:42:53] <stoned> parents gets all of them, until root, and .closest stops at the first match.
[13:42:57] <stoned> is that correcT?
[13:43:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:43:24] <stoned> Ty
[13:43:26] <robertmaxrees> .closest() also starts at the current element and then goes through all ancestors, stopping at the first one it finds.
[14:29:02] <DrJ> can the jquery $.getScript() function replace an already defined function?
[14:29:38] <taplar> i would imagine so
[14:30:07] <DrJ> I tried, but it didn't work :(
[14:31:19] <taplar> it would only be able to replace functions in the global scope, or accessable from the global scope
[14:31:30] <DrJ> function is global, I think
[14:31:44] <taplar> confirm that
[14:32:03] <DrJ> it's just originally defined through a <script src="main.js"></script>
[14:32:20] <taplar> that doesn't tell me anything about how the functions are defined
[14:32:28] <DrJ> with a straight: function myFunction() { ... }
[14:32:39] <DrJ> you didn't give me enough time :)
[14:32:49] <taplar> not inside any other functions or in an object or anything?
[14:32:54] <DrJ> nope
[14:33:08] <taplar> and you can open your console and type "myFunction" and see it?
[14:33:47] <DrJ> yes... the getScript call can even call the original function with simply: myFunction()
[14:33:59] <taplar> then yeah, that's global
[14:34:13] <taplar> how are you trying to replace it?
[14:34:30] <DrJ> but if I try to overwrite it with having the same: function myFunction() { ... } in the file getScript calls, it doesn't overwrite it
[14:40:14] <DrJ> okay, it's not updating the global
[14:41:32] <DrJ> if in the file I call with getScript I redefine the function and then within that file call myFunction() it executes the redefined version
[14:41:53] <DrJ> but later, outside of the getScript file, it's back to the original
[14:42:16] <DrJ> so it's not operating in the global scope as the docs indicate
[14:42:39] <taplar> i'd have to see it to comment more.  the api for getScript says it executes the script in the global scope, so that would suggest it could replace anything defined in the global scope
[14:43:08] <taplar> it could be anything from an async issue, to a caching of the original method as a callback in the logic.
[14:43:15] <taplar> just to name a couple possibilities
[14:51:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jvg0kq54/  assuming it is doing the global eval, yeah it can change the global function
[14:53:29] <DrJ> I'm not doing that eval
[14:53:34] <DrJ> maybe that's my problem?
[14:53:49] <taplar> no, jQuery is doing the eval
[14:54:28] <DrJ> my updating function is function loadScript() P $.getSCript("urlhere",function(){});}
[14:54:39] <DrJ> function loadScript() { $.getSCript("urlhere",function(){});}
[14:57:23] <DrJ> my main goal is to have that loadScript() called after the ready event which will be used to patch code for a cordova project
[14:58:15] <taplar> yes, jQuery runs the code in the global scope.  it does so by creating a new <script> Element, adding the script to it, and appending it to the <head>, and then removing it
[14:58:42] <taplar> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.js  you can see this in the DOMEval method
[15:00:06] <DrJ> hmm, maybe this is it... I'm calling the loadScript() which executes the getScript from inside an object
[15:00:15] <DrJ> maybe it can't be called that way?
[15:00:31] <DrJ> at least not for my desired purpose
[15:00:40] <taplar> doesn't matter.  appending the response script as a script to the head is global, regardless
[15:00:45] <DrJ> ah
[15:01:22] <taplar> so most likely you are hitting a caching issue, with your code referencing the original function rather than the new version
[15:02:37] <DrJ> anyway to clear that cache
[15:05:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ybf8h4Le/  i'd have to see the non-working version to try to identify how it's holding on to the original reference
[15:06:04] <taplar> how are you using the myFunction in your logic, when it is using the old reference?
[15:24:10] <larryOBee> hello?
[18:04:21] <kalel>  hi can someone tell me why this code "doesn't work correctly" my teacher want us to find out why : code https://pastebin.com/7ahVQdbA    maybe we this version is better ? https://pastebin.com/LEpm39zT
