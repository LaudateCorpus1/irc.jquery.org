[00:58:55] <CRCinAU> question. If I load a web page via https, how can I load something from within javascript from http://localhost/
[00:58:58] <CRCinAU> ?
[01:16:22] <solice> hmm
[01:16:35] <solice> is the site running publically under https?
[01:27:59] <CRCinAU> nah - its an embedded application type thing
[01:28:05] <CRCinAU> so it has no idea what https is
[01:28:50] <CRCinAU> ie it talks some kind of voodoo to a device on the COM port, and spits out JSON stuff at http://localhost:12345 (or whatever port you set)
[01:41:09] <Cork> CRCinAU: you can't
[01:41:24] <Cork> CRCinAU: loading from http into a https page defeats the encryption
[01:41:32] <Cork> so it isn't allowed (except for images)
[01:41:47] <Cork> and will see how long browsers allow that
[01:42:19] <Cork> CRCinAU: you can either have a proxy server running proxying between http and https, or just not use https
[03:07:31] <HcsOmot> hi,could someone please help out with some basic ajax and dom manipulation? I'm triggering an ajax call with onclick, and would like to modify the very element that triggered the ajax. but can't seem to get it working.
[03:12:37] <Cork> HcsOmot: make a jsfiddle
[03:17:09] <HcsOmot> Cork: i'm trying, but it's a mess. Give me a minute
[03:18:00] <Cork> HcsOmot: it doesn't have to run, but i need to see the code (and html) you're working with
[03:19:07] <HcsOmot> here we go
[03:19:08] <HcsOmot> https://jsfiddle.net/e69954pp/
[03:19:32] <HcsOmot> shall I explain in more detail what it is that I'm after?
[03:19:58] <Cork> 1. don't use <a> tags for none url actions
[03:20:06] <Cork> use <button> and style them with css
[03:20:17] <Cork> or more exactly use <button type="button">
[03:20:25] <HcsOmot> got it
[03:21:16] <Cork> is img_slider_ajax some form of global variable or what is that?
[03:22:03] <Cork> ah, have the server set content-type: application/json and you won't need the JSON.parse() line
[03:22:18] <Cork> also you have a ton of variables you haven't defined
[03:22:40] <Cork> (inbound, nextOffset, prevOffset are all globals)
[03:22:43] <HcsOmot> img_slider_ajax - that's the variable that holds the location of the wordpress' ajax script. that't the only way I can get it to work with wordpress
[03:22:50] <Cork> ok
[03:23:10] <HcsOmot> here's what I'm trying to do:
[03:23:24] <HcsOmot> i need a very simple, basic image slider for a web page.
[03:23:48] <HcsOmot> when the page loads, the first image is shown by default - it's hardcoded into html
[03:23:57] <Cork> why does the image slider need ajax though?
[03:24:09] <Cork> you're not loading new urls or anything making this a bit... weird
[03:24:18] <HcsOmot> oh, ok.
[03:24:21] <HcsOmot> do tell
[03:24:39] <HcsOmot> (I have very little knowledge of js / jquery)
[03:24:48] <Cork> or is that meant to happen from inbound?
[03:25:10] <HcsOmot> so if there's a better and more efficient to do it, I'll be glad to take advice
[03:25:11] <Cork> well if you have all the images loaded but hidden by default, you can just rotate them
[03:25:19] <Cork> then you don't need any ajax at all
[03:25:21] <HcsOmot> no, they aren't loaded
[03:25:31] <Cork> is it a lot of them?
[03:25:33] <HcsOmot> just a single image is loaded
[03:25:38] <Cork> (say more then 10)
[03:25:44] <HcsOmot> well, i think  at most 12
[03:25:55] <Cork> then i would just include the image url in the html source
[03:25:57] <Cork> give me a min
[03:26:13] <HcsOmot> ok
[03:27:47] <blinky_> Hi guys, wondering if someone can have a quick look at this - https://jsfiddle.net/47fcmtkg/ - I am selecting a user which in turn ajax's the users details, they are filled into a form ready for the user.  Everything works great except the select option for the company.  Any ideas?
[03:33:29] <Cork> HcsOmot: do you need separate descriptions for each image?
[03:33:45] <Cork> (meaning alt text)
[03:35:00] <HcsOmot> Cork: yes. and also, would need to update the current img count ( e.g. picture 3 of 12)
[03:35:14] <Cork> ya, that's easy
[03:35:28] <Cork> the alt affects the data structure i need to use though
[03:36:11] <HcsOmot> images are stored somewhere on disk, but the info on what images I need to show for what page is stored in db
[03:36:32] <HcsOmot> but i can pull that easily
[03:49:48] <Cork> HcsOmot: https://jsfiddle.net/e69954pp/1/
[03:49:51] <Cork> something like that
[03:50:24] <Cork> HcsOmot: the data-images blob in the html is an array of objects encoded as json (and then html_encoded)
[03:50:48] <Cork> format is [{"src": "", "alt": ""},{"src": "", "alt": ""}]
[03:51:15] <Cork> opps, i've messed up...
[03:51:46] <HcsOmot> what?
[03:52:10] <HcsOmot> oh man, and you even made it wrap around when you reach the last img...
[03:52:13] <HcsOmot> :)
[03:52:16] <HcsOmot> thanks :)
[03:53:21] <HcsOmot> so what's wrong with it?
[03:53:23] <Cork> HcsOmot: https://jsfiddle.net/e69954pp/2/
[03:53:31] <Cork> the left button didn't rotate to the max value
[03:54:04] <Cork> that will only ping the server to get the image if it isn't in the browsers cache
[03:54:09] <Cork> can't be much faster then that
[03:54:53] <Cork> and.. make sure it actually ends up on the max number and not max + 1... https://jsfiddle.net/e69954pp/3/
[03:55:46] <Cork> HcsOmot: feel free to ask questions (i actually encourage it) if there is anything in there you don't understand
[03:55:59] <HcsOmot> thank you very much!
[03:56:04] <Cork> np
[03:56:39] <HcsOmot> I'll pull it apart and go through it. I'll probably have couple of questions
[03:59:10] <Cork> heh
[03:59:19] <Cork> there is actually one optimization that is possible
[03:59:46] <Cork> image.attr(image.data('images')[index]) could replace the { src:, alt:  } line
[03:59:55] <Cork> as it only contains those two keys anyway
[04:00:14] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/e69954pp/4/
[04:03:34] <blinky_> Hi guys, wondering if someone can have a quick look at this - https://jsfiddle.net/47fcmtkg/ - I am selecting a user which in turn ajax's the users details, they are filled into a form ready for the user.  Everything works great except the select option for the company.  Any ideas?
[04:04:12] <Cork> blinky_: just use $('
[04:04:15] <Cork> bah...
[04:04:35] <Cork> blinky_: just use $('select').val(details[ 0 ].company)
[04:04:58] <Cork> blinky_: so none psudo code: $('#company').val(details[ 0 ].company)
[04:05:24] <Cork> blinky_: also never EVER use .attr to set dom element state
[04:05:28] <blinky_> Cork the select worked great, cheers
[04:05:30] <blinky_> oh
[04:05:32] <Cork> it isn't cross browser safe
[04:05:36] <Cork> use .prop()
[04:05:36] <blinky_> ah
[04:05:43] <blinky_> Right o, cheers
[04:05:49] <Cork> attr is to set and read atttributes not properties
[04:06:30] <Cork> better invert that comment actually, always use .prop() unless .prop() doesn't work when you try it
[04:07:15] <blinky_> Cheers Cork.
[04:08:05] <mareosa> Hi guys its possible to change the way this effect works ?
[04:08:13] <mareosa> https://api.jqueryui.com/fold-effect/
[04:08:36] <Cork> the way it works?
[04:08:43] <mareosa> I want to put it showing instead of hidding
[04:09:34] <mareosa> yes Cork , if you click it will hide, i want to do the oposite way
[04:09:46] <Cork> mareosa: you mean like .show('fold') ?
[04:10:21] <Cork> (and for readability .hide('fold') )
[04:14:10] <mareosa> Thanks Cork that worked
[04:14:47] <mareosa> One more thing, its possible to slow down the effect ?
[04:15:25] <Cork> mareosa: https://api.jqueryui.com/show/
[04:17:51] <mareosa> Thanks, that's it
[04:23:52] <MACscr> I know Im doign this wrong as im obviously just getting the value of element, but how do i instead output the matching var value? https://jsfiddle.net/MACscr/9afmtjLa/1/
[04:24:36] <MACscr> as in if i select a button with id="firstname", how do i then append the value of var firstname; to stage?
[04:41:56] <MACscr> well i see part of my logic that was wrong, this should work https://jsfiddle.net/9afmtjLa/2/
[04:42:03] <MACscr> but im still failing. maybe i need to go to bed. lol
[04:43:38] <Cork> MACscr: what are you trying to do?
[04:44:01] <Cork> add the html from the object if the id matches?
[04:44:08] <MACscr> yes
[04:44:16] <Cork> .append(buttons[element])
[04:45:00] <MACscr> https://jsfiddle.net/9afmtjLa/3/
[04:45:01] <Cork> and the if statement should check if(buttons[element != undefined) {}
[04:45:05] <Cork> opps
[04:45:06] <MACscr> still no nice
[04:45:09] <MACscr> dice
[04:45:10] <Cork> and the if statement should check if(buttons[element] != undefined) {}
[04:45:10] <MACscr> lol
[04:45:15] <MACscr> hmm
[04:45:52] <MACscr> ah, that did it
[04:46:40] <printForever> is there a way to catch alert before it goes off? like break point?
[04:49:12] <Cork> printForever: not really
[04:49:23] <printForever> oh crap
[04:49:30] <printForever> I can't find where the alert() is generated
[04:49:41] <Cork> printForever: alerts are nasty, as they force the browser to do a lot of fake code handling
[04:50:08] <printForever> Cork, this is what I'm trying to solve
[04:50:16] <Cork> you could do something like window.alert = function() { debugging; };
[04:50:45] <printForever> Uncaught TypeError: confirm is not a function
[04:51:44] <printForever> how do I CATCH that TypeError and make it "do something"
[04:51:50] <printForever> instead of throwing an error
[04:53:23] <Cork> printForever: you could try window.onerror = function() {}
[04:53:35] <printForever> hm...
[04:53:42] <printForever> onerror works for all errors?
[04:53:54] <Cork> all exceptions
[04:54:00] <Cork> alternatively window.addEventListener('error', function(error) { })
[04:54:09] <Cork> if you want to write it as a handler
[04:54:24] <Cork> (i recommend not using jquery as it messes with the error object)
[04:55:12] <Cork> error.error.stack will give you what line and what file the error was in
[04:59:20] <MACscr> Cork my apologies for being so needy, but after i create that new button or input, how do i identify it so that i can do other things with it like so? https://jsfiddle.net/9afmtjLa/5/
[04:59:37] <MACscr> i know btn is wrong, its just a placeholder
[05:00:16] <Cork> MACscr: i would recommend adding it as a delegated event handler on a static parent
[05:01:50] <Cork> MACscr: but what is it your trying to do?
[05:02:10] <Cork> why do you need to be able to add multiple input fields?
[05:02:34] <MACscr> Cork i have no idea what you just said. lol. Im trying to make the input fields or buttons that i dynamically create draggable and resizable
[05:03:11] <Cork> that you later can drag into another place you mean?
[05:04:20] <Cork> if that is the case you want something like https://jsfiddle.net/9afmtjLa/6/
[05:04:23] <MACscr> Cork this is a very simplified example, but my end result will be a background image has buttons/inputs in the actual image and this little editor will be for adding the real overlay buttons/inputs and then resizing/dragging them over the graphic elements and then simply saving the newly generated html
[05:04:51] <Cork> MACscr: ya, and my point was the event handlers should be shared for the entire group
[05:05:06] <Cork> you don't need to create separate event handlers for each element (that will just slow down the page)
[05:05:42] <Cork> $('static-parent').on('click', '.button1', function() {}) can handle all future events matching that selector
[05:05:49] <Cork> as long as the element is inside that parent
[05:08:30] <printForever> thank you Cork!!!
[05:12:56] <MACscr> Cork your example didnt work, i was able to modify it a bit and get it to slightly work, but im getting major erros from jquery-ui https://jsfiddle.net/9afmtjLa/8/
[05:13:38] <MACscr> when i try to resize the element and of course i dont get why it completely screws up the look of the input. I dont need to see much of it since its just an overlay, but for testing, it is odd
[05:15:29] <Cork> MACscr: ui adds a wrapper around the input element
[05:15:30] <MACscr> hmm, i did at least make the stage larger it its less confusing https://jsfiddle.net/9afmtjLa/10/
[05:15:35] <Cork> that is prob what causes problem for you
[05:40:48] <MACscr> hmm, i decided to wrap them in a div, that made things better, but i still get that cannot read property 'left' of undefined http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/3/
[05:42:38] <Cork> MACscr: you can't do it like that
[05:42:59] <Cork> that will run resizable on all existing resizable elements every time you add a new one
[05:43:28] <Cork> you need to store $(buttons[element]) in a variable and use that
[05:43:49] <Cork> (on all the places in the event handler where you use $(buttons[element]) now)
[05:49:21] <MACscr> this seemed to work http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/5/
[05:49:38] <MACscr> oh, just saw your last response. hmm
[05:51:40] <MACscr> http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/6/
[05:51:54] <MACscr> ok, updated with your idea and it seems to be working decently
[05:52:04] <MACscr> hard to find out where to grab onto it to move it though
[05:58:11] <HcsOmot> Cork: all done. works great. thank you very very much for your help
[05:58:27] <Cork> HcsOmot: np
[06:12:44] <printForever> Cork: how can I handle the error?
[06:14:55] <nobodyknows> hello
[06:16:21] <nobodyknows> I recently started playing around with web RTC and I need help to make it work with php websockets server. Has anyone here tried it?
[06:43:05] <MACscr> any ideas what i need to do to get the ui.position to be relative to its parent? http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/9/
[06:52:54] <Cork> MACscr: you prob have to subtract the position of the parent from the value
[06:54:07] <MACscr> Cork seems kind of hackish, my i might have to do that. Im surprised there isnt a more relative position option
[06:55:27] <Cork> MACscr: the helper is positioned absolute related to the document
[06:55:32] <Cork> and the number comes from there
[07:05:04] <MACscr> makes sense. thanks. I got something working
[07:05:22] <Duikb00t> typeahead users in hte room?
[07:09:29] <s77> hi,  could you help me out with the following question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42366506/webserver-plc-siemens-javascript-when-click-set-value
[07:17:58] <cp> hey guys can anyone tell me how to set the droppable position?
[07:19:24] <Cork> set droppable position?
[07:19:32] <Cork> what do you mean?
[08:03:29] <skuaskua> Hey, why do I get "this.index is not a function" error?
[08:03:31] <skuaskua> https://jsfiddle.net/4f92rLhx/
[08:05:07] <Cork> skuaskua: .index() is a jquery method so you need to wrap the dom element with $()
[08:05:12] <Cork> $(this).index()
[08:10:21] <skuaskua> thanks

[08:19:12] <cp> Hi there I had an issue with a droppable element ... the issue is there is a seris of elements which are droppable ... and the draggable element is larger than 15px (each droppable element is 15 pxs)
[08:22:43] <MassDebates> codecutter:  That looks like it can be easily solved
[08:23:03] <ctmarco> Anyone have ideqa what bug might be if i cant click in input box if not valid fields?
[08:23:28] <codecutter> perhaps, i havn't bothered to familiarise myself with the library (its a one off thing)
[08:23:52] <MassDebates> You don't need to
[08:24:01] <MassDebates> It'll probably work with something like         marginLeft: 0
[08:24:14] <MassDebates> throw it under your chart data.
[08:24:19] <MassDebates> Hm, let me try it first before I suggest it
[08:24:35] <MassDebates> Ah, yeah, that oughtta do it. https://jsfiddle.net/t86b1vjy/ Forgot the comma at first.
[08:24:55] <MassDebates> ctmarco:  fiddle or codepen?

[08:45:05] <dglambert> morning
[08:51:00] <stennowork> good day, i have a question about event delegation/bubbling. I have a small element "foo" which is set above another element "bar" via position: absolute;. Now, how can i make any event triggered on the "foo" element being delegated to the "bar" element?
[08:52:06] <stennowork> i know that i can use $("foo").on("eventname", "bar", handler); but i want to delegate for all events
[08:59:28] <newcoder> Anyone there?
[08:59:44] <newcoder> Is using jquery too much if you need to use only the $ajax(); function?
[09:00:16] <stennowork> which browsers do you want to support?
[09:00:34] <MikeD_> stennowork: that doesn't sound like delegation
[09:00:49] <stennowork> MikeD_, oh hm
[09:01:21] <newcoder> firefox
[09:01:21] <stennowork> i thought delegation would basically mean triggering an event on a different element than that which it was supposed to trigger on
[09:01:39] <stennowork> newcoder, you can check out the fetch API
[09:02:17] <newcoder> What is fetch API? What to do with this?
[09:02:21] <MikeD_> no, delegation is registering an event on a parent and relying on event bubbling to get to the parent... which is nice when you don't even have the children IN the dom when you're registering the listener
[09:02:41] <MikeD_> and it saves you from defining 20+ anonymous handlers for the same exact function
[09:02:51] <stennowork> newcoder, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
[09:03:01] <stennowork> MikeD_, hrm
[09:03:33] <stennowork> MikeD_, ok, what i want then is to pass any event triggered on one element to another
[09:03:51] <MikeD_> are you trying to intercept clicks on element #Foo and then triggering a click on #Bar ?
[09:03:57] <stennowork> yes
[09:04:04] <stennowork> i am working on an example jsfiddle, set
[09:04:06] <stennowork> sec*
[09:04:29] <stennowork> when clicking on #foo, it should be more or less 'invisible' to events
[09:04:39] <stennowork> i.e. it should act as if the underlying bar was clicked
[09:05:14] <stennowork> i think even the mouse coordinates on click must be as if bar was clicked
[09:05:28] <MikeD_> $('#foo').on('click',function(evt){ $('#bar').trigger('click',evt) } )
[09:05:46] <stennowork> MikeD_, yeah, and that for any possible event?
[09:06:03] <MikeD_> you can use a space-separate event list
[09:06:07] <stennowork> argh
[09:06:17] <MikeD_> or are you really trying to capture a redirect custom events too?
[09:06:20] <stennowork> yeah i feared that, thanks
[09:06:44] <stennowork> no, it should just be several mouse-related and mousewheel-related events
[09:06:46] <MikeD_> now i'm kinda curious to see that fiddle :)
[09:06:49] <stennowork> no custom events involved
[09:07:03] <stennowork> oh its very simple
[09:07:24] <Cork> stennowork: there is a pointer-event css property you can use to prevent the top most element not react to mouse events
[09:07:39] <Cork> though it is fairly new so it has some browser requirements
[09:07:54] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[09:08:21] <stennowork> and that would act as if the topmost element would not exist?
[09:08:26] <Cork> yes
[09:08:32] <stennowork> as in, it would instead trigger on the element that is below that element?
[09:08:38] <Cork> yes :D
[09:08:48] <stennowork> woot well this is exactly what i want!
[09:08:49] <MikeD_> below / behind ?
[09:08:49] <stennowork> thanks
[09:08:52] <stennowork> behind
[09:09:04] <stennowork> browser support could indeed be a problem though
[09:09:12] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events#Browser_compatibility
[09:09:24] <Cork> ie11 is prob the most problematic requirement
[09:09:31] <stennowork> hmm ie11
[09:09:36] <stennowork> right, ie10 would've been nice
[09:09:48] <Cork> chrome and firefox has supported it for a long time
[09:09:53] <stennowork> yeah figures :v
[09:09:55] <stennowork> stupid ie
[09:10:07] <stennowork> always in the way of progress
[09:10:24] <Cork> well there browser tend to stay around much longer
[09:10:41] <Cork> chrome and firefox burn through 20 versions while ie updates one :)
[09:11:09] <stennowork> major versions no less
[09:11:18] <Cork> well they only have major so...
[09:11:37] <stennowork> hm i guess
[09:11:47] <Cork> (and a lot of projects are moving to that now days)
[09:12:12] * Cork wonders when the first project that bumps by 10 will come...)
[09:12:19] <stennowork> lol
[09:12:38] <Cork> or by 2 1 for beta and 2 for release :)
[09:14:43] <Cork> stennowork: heh just found https://github.com/kmewhort/pointer_events_polyfill
[09:14:57] <Cork> i can't say how well it works, but the code doesn't look too horrible at least
[09:15:40] <stennowork> is 'wheel' in mouseEvents?
[09:16:13] <stennowork> lol it sets display to none and then does .elementFromPoint
[09:16:20] <Cork> no, don't think so
[09:16:32] <stennowork> hr
[09:16:34] <stennowork> m
[09:16:56] <stennowork> but i think i can implement that and just collect all the relevant events and write them into a list as MikeD_ initially suggested
[09:17:17] <Cork> retriggering events isn't always working though
[09:17:30] <Cork> ex straight clicks on a tags won't work for example
[09:17:44] <stennowork> the polyfill just does $(underneathElem).trigger(e);
[09:18:05] <Cork> ah, so it does
[09:18:11] <Cork> ya, that won't work then
[09:18:31] <Cork> btw the display thing won't actually cause a rendering
[09:18:38] <Cork> as the browser doesn't render while js runs
[09:18:56] <stennowork> hm interesting, good to know
[09:19:12] <Cork> so ya, there isn't really a good way to do this in browsers that doesn't support pointer-events
[09:19:16] <stennowork> lemme collect all the possible events i would need to pass beneath
[09:19:18] <stennowork> damn
[09:19:32] <stennowork> thanks Cork and MikeD_ for the explanations and help
[09:19:48] <Cork> stennowork: though that said
[09:20:13] <Cork> you could bind the click handler on a shared parent and handle everything from there based on mouse coordinats...
[09:20:27] <MikeD_> yeah, THAT would be delegation
[09:20:28] <Cork> then you won't have to fake events (though that isn't exactly fun either)
[09:20:36] <Cork> well not exactly
[09:20:41] <Cork> cause you can't delegate
[09:20:44] <stennowork> i can tell you my use case
[09:20:46] <Cork> as you won't click the target element
[09:21:10] <stennowork> i have an SVG map which i pan and zoom based on mouse input, it behaves exactly like google maps
[09:21:21] <MikeD_> oh, ok - i wasn't thinking of the second parameter as delegation as much as registering on the parent... but kk
[09:21:28] <stennowork> but there are text labels floating above it, and those aren't svg but spans
[09:21:36] <stennowork> floating on top of it
[09:22:03] <Cork> stennowork: i would definitely loop at if you can make those svg, cause if you can pointer-events was an svg standard from day one
[09:22:08] <Cork> and all browsers support it for svg
[09:22:18] <Cork> uh.. loop==look
[09:22:29] <stennowork> yeah its very complicated though, of course those were my first attempts
[09:22:37] <Cork> ya, i know
[09:22:38] <stennowork> because the text must not zoom, only pan
[09:22:48] <stennowork> and if i zoom i also do an implicit pan
[09:22:59] <stennowork> (if i zoom on mouse center)
[09:23:03] <Cork> you zoom using transform?
[09:23:11] <stennowork> yeah, transform matrix on the viewport
[09:23:19] <Cork> then you could use that on a g tag
[09:23:41] <stennowork> :o
[09:23:42] <Cork> and have the label outside that
[09:23:42] <stennowork> no wai
[09:23:50] <stennowork> yeah but
[09:23:58] <stennowork> the label still has to pan, mind
[09:24:04] <MikeD_> g tag?
[09:24:13] <Cork> you could pan the viewport but zoom the g tag
[09:24:13] <stennowork> MikeD_, svg groups
[09:24:23] <Cork> it should work
[09:24:52] <Cork> alternatively you could have two groups and do the modification needed for each group
[09:24:53] <stennowork> i am using a library, i must further hack it (already hacked 'smooth' zoom into it)
[09:25:32] <Cork> ya, not saying this is you're base choice, from a work point of view
[09:25:37] <Cork> but i think it is the cleanest
[09:25:43] <stennowork> this is surely true
[09:26:25] <Cork> and i'm always a bit gittery about retriggering random event on random elements
[09:26:49] <Cork> it works fine when you do the implemention, but then down the line you need to add something and this string cheese blows up
[09:27:19] <stennowork> come to think of it, i have to implement it for SVG anyway
[09:27:27] <stennowork> because we also want to add labels at some point
[09:27:40] <stennowork> and those must behave the same way (not zoom, but pan)
[09:28:06] <stennowork> again, the biggest problem is that every zoom also does an implicit pan if i center zoom on mouse pointer
[09:28:22] <stennowork> i will have to read through the source more and see where the differenciation is made
[09:28:34] <Cork> ya, that will prob be quite a bit of work
[09:28:45] <Cork> matrixes are... fun
[09:29:17] <stennowork> yeah i vaguely remember on how to do matrix operations, but... i'd have to read into that a bit more too
[09:29:18] <stennowork> :P
[09:29:33] <stennowork> uni was such a long time ago and also i hardly attended my classes >_>"
[09:29:41] <Cork> ya, i tend for forget basically everything about it from each time i do it >_<
[09:29:51] <Cork> and i hate it every time >_>
[09:30:10] <stennowork> the concept of matrix transformation itself is brilliant imo
[09:30:22] <Cork> sure, it is exceptionally powerful
[09:30:31] <Cork> not the most straight forward to use though
[09:30:36] <stennowork> true
[09:30:46] <stennowork> well thanks again, i am out for a short breka
[09:30:51] <Cork> somewhat like regex i would say
[09:30:55] <stennowork> hah
[09:37:09] <stennowork> it will be interesting to also hack the animation i did with $.animate into seperate elemens
[09:37:17] <stennowork> objects, in this case
[09:37:48] <stennowork> actually that'd be not too much of a problem, i can simply extend to object i am $.animate'ing over
[09:38:19] <Cork> you animate using js >_>
[09:38:30] <Cork> i would definitely have used css transform/animation
[09:38:40] <Cork> though, ya again ie limitations :)
[09:38:57] <stennowork> i found $.animate to be convenient in this case
[09:39:28] <Cork> it generates quite a bit less smooth animations as it doesn't use the gpu though
[09:39:46] <Cork> (also cause the browser doesn't know about it before hand so it can't optimize)
[09:39:48] <stennowork> i have an svgmatrix object which holds a,b,c,d,e,f, which i animate over, and on each step i write the transformation matrix
[09:39:59] <stennowork> yeah i saw an increase in cpu usage
[09:40:32] <stennowork> i guess for vanilla js thats the animationframe thingy
[09:40:48] <Cork> no
[09:41:05] <stennowork> setInterval? D:
[09:41:06] <Cork> jquery uses requestAnimationFrame since a few versions ago
[09:41:14] <Cork> js can't do it
[09:41:39] <Cork> there is some new intefaces on the way but as far as i know it haven't landed in any browser yet
[09:41:44] <stennowork> hrm
[09:42:20] <Cork> the problem with js animation is that it is a black box to the browser
[09:42:32] <Cork> then have to call the handler and wait for what ever happen to happen
[09:42:43] <Cork> it can't do this preemptively
[09:42:43] <stennowork> i could actually express the transformation matrix in seperate css transform instructions
[09:43:07] <Cork> @keyframe lets you declare more complext flows if you need it
[09:43:09] <stennowork> because i think i cannot animate over matrix() like that
[09:43:14] <stennowork> ah @keyframe, right
[09:44:04] <stennowork> hm i could also see if https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity improves performance
[09:44:34] <Cork> yup jqeury 4 is meant to use it
[09:44:46] <Cork> (if i remember correctly, or it was 3)
[09:45:50] <Cork> also i'm quite sure transition can animate matrix, as all transforms are converted to matrix when the browser does the animation
[09:46:26] <stennowork> hrn
[09:47:24] <stennowork> stackoverflow tells me that $.animate doesn't work for non-numeric properties
[09:48:03] <stennowork> i'd still have to use the step/progress callbacks
[09:49:06] <Cork> that isn't fully true
[09:49:23] <Cork> firstly there are plugins that extend it, jquery-ui has some for example
[09:49:25] <stennowork> how would i animate over transform: translate, for example?
[09:49:40] <Cork> it has a step callback function
[09:49:57] <stennowork> yeah i just mentioned that :P
[09:49:59] <Cork> you can use that if there isn't a feature for what you need
[09:50:42] <Cork> stennowork: https://louisremi.github.io/jquery.transform.js/
[09:50:49] <Cork> for example :)
[09:51:19] <stennowork> i am using progress callback atm because that fires each time its done with altering all of the attributes
[09:51:31] <stennowork> and step fires each time for each single attribute
[09:53:09] <stennowork> hrm i have a problem here, tells me $ is not defined elol
[09:53:14] <stennowork> lemme restart my browser :|
[09:53:42] <stennowork> wat i still get the error
[09:53:58] <stennowork> Mixed Content: The page at 'https://louisremi.github.io/jquery.transform.js/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure script 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.js'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[09:54:00] <stennowork> hehe
[09:54:04] <stennowork> damn..
[09:54:15] <Cork> heh opps :)
[09:54:46] <stennowork> ok i allowed it to load 'insecure scripts'
[09:54:51] <Cork> loading ajax.googleapis.com through //ajax.googleapi.com/... is a nice way to avoid that
[09:55:16] <stennowork> noted
[09:55:27] <Cork> ah, didn't notice what url it was from >_>
[09:56:16] <Cork> and ya, i replace ajax.googleapis.com with a local extension so never do the http request :)
[09:56:31] <stennowork> same, i don't use cdn unless i can't avoid it
[09:57:10] <Cork> no i mean i have an extension that actively replace cdn resources if a page i visit uses it
[09:57:18] <stennowork> ooh!
[09:57:28] <stennowork> nice nice
[09:58:22] <Cork> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes
[09:58:23] <Cork> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/local-cdn/dgfedofdiaapcideaajjaklpmdpcdapg
[10:21:03] <MikeD_> why not use cdn ?
[10:24:11] <stennowork> because sometimes the cdn response times suck
[10:24:24] <stennowork> if you have a static version anyway you can just download it and use it
[10:24:54] <stennowork> the only problem is that it adds a few megabytes to your hard disk
[10:24:57] <stennowork> which isn't a problem
[10:25:38] <MikeD_> ugh, that defeats the whole idea of a cdn
[10:26:09] <MikeD_> i had hope the answer would be poisoned cdn is a security risk
[10:29:08] <snover> subresource integrity solves the poisoned CDN problem, but using a CDN to load a script is slower than bundling that script with your other code, so you shouldn’t do it anyway
[10:40:17] <stennowork> wait, 'wheel' is a mouse event!
[10:46:35] <MassDebates> Is it an input pushed to the browser?
[10:46:47] <MassDebates> Can the UA respond to it, or at least detect it?
[10:46:50] <MassDebates> It's an event!
[10:47:20] <MassDebates> But there's more than just 1 single event associated with the mouse wheel input
[10:47:23] <MassDebates> I think it has 5?
[10:47:33] <stennowork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/wheel
[10:47:52] <stennowork> This interface inherits properties from its parents, MouseEvent, UIEvent and Event.
[10:47:57] <stennowork> its from MouseEvent
[10:49:10] <stennowork> that is what i meant with "'wheel' is a mouse event"
[10:49:11] <MassDebates> er, yeah, sorry
[10:49:14] <MassDebates> Props, not events
[10:49:16] <MassDebates> My bad!
[10:49:56] <stennowork> that fact is relevant for pointer-events
[10:51:01] <stennowork> that means that 'wheel' is affected by css pointer-events
[10:53:37] <stennowork> lets check cross-browser now...
[10:59:07] <stennowork> IE11 does not support transform on svg elements.
[10:59:51] <stennowork> neither does edge
[10:59:55] <stennowork> css transform that is
[11:01:49] <stennowork> matrix(0.999833 0 0 0.999833 0.249982 2.35438e-005)
[11:01:55] <stennowork> tha fuck is that bullshit
[11:01:57] <stennowork> IE11 wtf
[11:04:10] <MassDebates> stennowork:  you can use transforms on SVG in IE11...
[11:09:25] <stennowork> i can use transform attribute but not css transform
[11:09:29] <stennowork> according to caniuse
[11:09:59] <MassDebates> In IE11?
[11:10:08] <MassDebates> I think you can use CSS transforms, but you'll probably have to drive it with some javascript
[11:10:24] <stennowork> ... drive it with some javascript?
[11:10:33] <stennowork> Does not support CSS transforms on SVG elements (transform attribute can be used instead)
[11:10:42] <stennowork> ^ what caniuse says to IE11 2d transforms
[11:11:05] <MassDebates> Well, if you want to avoid the issues with IE11 I'd suggest you'd stop relying on Caniuse's data (which is starting to get less and less accurate as time goes on) for transforms.
[11:11:18] <MassDebates> It might be better to try to work it and use the MSDN's information about IE11.
[11:12:22] <stennowork> yeah its a bug in ie11
[11:12:25] <MassDebates> if I recall correctly, I think the issue is with IE11 using CSS's transform directly with CSS, but I'm sure you can punch in some styles using Javascript directly.
[11:14:18] <Es0teric> question -- http://pastebin.com/iLhZcbTp i am trying to make line 25 trigger but I do not understand why it is not triggerng
[11:16:11] <stennowork> https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/836470/
[11:18:29] <MassDebates> stennowork:  http://jsfiddle.net/hbvg01d2/ Does this work?
[11:19:25] <stennowork> MassDebates, nope
[11:19:39] <stennowork> not in IE11
[11:19:47] <MassDebates> Good. Then we're on the same page. This should, then: http://jsfiddle.net/9asdt0y0/
[11:20:20] <MassDebates> Es0teric:  Codepen?
[11:20:20] <stennowork> yep, as i mentioned before, setting the 'transform' attribute works
[11:20:55] <MassDebates> Yes, but you're not limited to this.
[11:20:58] <MassDebates> You can drive whatever you want.
[11:21:04] <stennowork> so caniuse confirmed
[11:21:12] <MassDebates> confirmed and incomplete, yes.
[11:21:17] <stennowork> why incomplete?
[11:21:21] <MassDebates> Also, wildly inaccurate on transforms regarding many devices.
[11:21:24] <MassDebates> Hm
[11:21:28] <MassDebates> I'll give you 3 devices right now
[11:21:37] <MassDebates> No transforms on samsung mobile (native not chrome) browsers
[11:21:47] <MassDebates> Galaxy Tablets
[11:21:58] <stennowork> ah with incomplete you mean 'doesnt list all browsers'
[11:22:09] <MassDebates> And even listed browsers.
[11:22:26] <MassDebates> on Saffy there's no mention on caniuse about its issues with non-keyword transparencies in gradients.
[11:22:52] <MassDebates> They're working on updating stuff, but that's just the start. Lots of fails of mentions for advanced CSS selectors with pseudos
[11:23:05] <MassDebates> Caniuse is a great resource, but it isn't a bible.
[11:23:16] <Es0teric> MassDebates i dont have a codepen version of it
[11:23:22] <MassDebates> Es0teric:  make one.
[11:23:23] <Es0teric> i just have the pastebin
[11:23:33] <stennowork> surely it tells me about all the browsers i care about
[11:23:43] <stennowork> regarding css3 2d transforms
[11:23:48] <MassDebates> stennowork:  then it's perfect for you.
[11:23:48] <stennowork> which was the information i wante
[11:23:49] <stennowork> d
[11:23:52] <stennowork> yeah
[11:23:59] <stennowork> i never heard 'saffy' before
[11:24:00] <MassDebates> As for your transforms, you can still use what I'm saying.
[11:24:03] <MassDebates> Safari
[11:24:04] <Es0teric> MassDebates http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PWMaOv
[11:24:05] <Es0teric> there you go
[11:24:54] <stennowork> MassDebates, that was information i already had from caniuse. as i mentioned several times now, caniuse said that transform attribute works in IE11
[11:25:52] <stennowork> now i have a different problem though regarding floating point precision on IE11
[11:26:06] <MassDebates> I just wanted to show you that you are able to do more than that. That's all.
[11:26:23] <ctjctj> Hello!  I'm looking for a jquery or jquery.ui that fires an ajax call when focus leaves an input field.
[11:26:25] <MassDebates> Seems like you either A) aren't concerned with those capabilities or B) don't feel they're valuable.
[11:26:36] <stennowork> MassDebates, but you do the same, you also set the transform attribute of the element
[11:26:42] <stennowork> or did i misunderstood your code
[11:27:30] <MassDebates> Yes, you're still misunderstanding.
[11:27:44] <stennowork> ok, so what do you do different in your code then?
[11:28:10] <stennowork> g.setAttribute('transform', transform);
[11:28:10] <stennowork>  // i thought this would set the attribute 'transform' on the element
[11:28:59] <MassDebates> I just took a screenshot. Uploading.
[11:29:32] <MassDebates> First off, setting an attribute isn't exactly the same as setting an element's inline style from the style attribute, even though the style attribute is an attribute.
[11:29:46] <stennowork> no, style="something" is css rules
[11:29:54] <MassDebates> Yes, that's CSS inline.
[11:29:58] <stennowork> yes
[11:29:59] <MassDebates> Which can be set directly by JS
[11:30:03] <stennowork> so?
[11:30:13] <MassDebates> Also something that can be set by JS: Attributes directly (like stlye, but style is a specific one)
[11:30:24] <stennowork> yes..?
[11:30:24] <MassDebates> These two are different.
[11:30:26] <stennowork> yes
[11:30:29] <stennowork> i am aware of that
[11:31:02] <MassDebates> You can set IE styles with setting the style, not applying an attribute directly. Applying the attribute directly is one method that works in IE. Another method doesn't limit you to direct attributes, but also styles enacted by javascript.
[11:31:39] <MassDebates> These two methods have different performances.
[11:32:26] <MassDebates> Also, other things in IE's troubles with CSS can also be worked around, evne when they don't have a direct attribute but only a style available to set the necessary/desired prosp
[11:32:28] <MassDebates> props*
[11:33:15] <stennowork> its a bit confusing that you define the attribute in the css, then get it via getComputedStyle and then assign it to the element again
[11:33:36] <stennowork> i mean, not your code is confusing, its confusing that it works like that
[11:34:04] <stennowork> so the element has the css attribute, but doesn't render it
[11:35:14] <MassDebates> Let's take a different example, because transforms are a weird exception
[11:35:20] <MassDebates> Look at that screenshot
[11:35:31] <MassDebates> the top line of the developer tools code. it says
[11:35:39] <stennowork> you have to post the link
[11:36:00] <MassDebates> <iframe id="iFrameKey-0cf3689f-497e-1c38-2767-ad8cc3954f66" src="https://s.codepen.io/boomerang/iFrameKey-0cf3689f-497e-1c38-2767-ad8cc3954f66/index.html" name="CodePen" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-pointer-lock allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms" allowtransparency="true" class="result-iframe"></iframe>
[11:36:04] <MassDebates> Don't worry, I was posting the text.
[11:36:11] <MassDebates> This is from that codepen that I gave you a screenshot of.
[11:36:19] <stennowork> you didn't give me a screenshot
[11:36:24] <MassDebates> OH lmao
[11:36:25] <MassDebates> SOrry
[11:36:29] <MassDebates> http://imgur.com/a/UcIiH
[11:36:31] <MassDebates> ahahahaha
[11:36:37] <MassDebates> That'd be probably a bit helpful, no?
[11:36:44] <MassDebates> My apologies stennowork
[11:37:28] <stennowork> yeah disabled is a property of an html element, not a css rule
[11:38:46] <powi> Hello, is there a jQuery way to do : document.getElementsByClassName('CLASS')[3].getElementsByTagName('buttons'), please ?
[11:39:14] <MassDebates> stennowork:  Right, but that's fine.
[11:39:15] <powi> (I'm stuck with $('CLASS')[3]. )
[11:39:19] <jak2000> hi all
[11:39:28] <MassDebates> stennowork:  There's a difference between html attrs and CSS props
[11:39:31] <stennowork> yes
[11:39:33] <stennowork> i know
[11:39:37] <stennowork> look
[11:39:41] <MassDebates> stennowork:  Right. SO let's look at the iframe code above.
[11:39:44] <stennowork> what do you want to tell me
[11:39:56] <MassDebates> Eh, nevermind.
[11:40:03] <jak2000> wich grid recommend me for, edit, delete rows (json data) and can save changes to db?
[11:40:09] <stennowork> i know the difference between css attributes and html attributes
[11:40:12] <MassDebates> Because you can set opacity from CSS and set transparency from attrs
[11:40:23] <MassDebates> I was just trying to show you examples of how you can work around IEs issues with CSS
[11:40:32] <MassDebates> And it's beyond using attrs directly, like I've shown you with the screenshot
[11:40:39] <MassDebates> (That I forgot to paste at first, sorry about that again)
[11:41:13] <stennowork> you set attributes via javascript instead of writing them into the html
[11:41:47] <stennowork> you also could've written <button disabled="disabled">Hello World!</button>

[12:16:13] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/23xv2v2h/4/
[12:16:32] <WhirledPress> Could someone help with animating ScrollTop ^
[12:16:45] <robertmaxrees> what's the question WhirledPress?
[12:17:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees thanks
[12:17:28] <WhirledPress> if you click on Services, then click again, it goes somewhere wierd. Also after a couple clicks it all seems off.
[12:17:34] <jak2000> robertmaxrees you use bootstrap?
[12:17:47] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 yep.
[12:17:49] <robertmaxrees> lots of people do.
[12:18:25] <robertmaxrees> WhirledPress because it starts stopping and starting on you?
[12:18:36] <robertmaxrees> and behaving kinf of funny?
[12:19:07] <WhirledPress> It appears that using the offset().top of a section is not good for scrolling the <main> element
[12:19:54] <WhirledPress> How do I deteremine the correct value to scroll <main> so that the correct section appears at the top when a link to it is clicked.
[12:20:43] <robertmaxrees> why not look them up and store them on pageload?
[12:20:51] <robertmaxrees> then just nab the correct ones.
[12:21:02] <WhirledPress> and every resize or change in orientation?
[12:21:06] <jak2000> robertmaxrees datatable plugin edit columns/rows is not free :(
[12:21:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 https://editor.datatables.net/examples/inline-editing/simple
[12:22:01] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[12:22:04] <robertmaxrees> that's the plugin still.
[12:22:14] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) search around and see if there's a free alternative.
[12:26:34] <Saint_Isadore> I have this page that has a product selector.. right now in order to select a product you need to click the blue select button, I'd like to make it select the item if you click anywhere on the container box. I've tried a lot of different approach but can seem to get it to work. Any advice would be appreciated: https://getskinprov.com/core/checkout.php
[12:27:11] <Saint_Isadore> I got the css switching but the actual so it appears as though the product is switching too, but its not
[12:27:33] <Saint_Isadore> nevermind that last sentence, thats on my local machine
[12:28:12] <Saint_Isadore> new to jquery so I might be missing something easy
[12:29:23] <robertmaxrees> Saint_Isadore can you make a simplified fiddle and show us your jx?
[12:29:41] <robertmaxrees> *js
[12:30:19] <Saint_Isadore> HI robertmaxrees I don't think so, since its tying into a node.js framework
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:30:43] <robertmaxrees> huh
[12:30:45] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:30:54] <robertmaxrees> i don't need your backend.  just the frontend code.
[12:30:58] <robertmaxrees> the html/js
[12:32:33] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, check out the js.
[12:32:40] <robertmaxrees> the idea seems pretty straightforward.
[12:33:08] <Saint_Isadore> The code that currently handles the product switching when the select button is clicked is written in node (which I'm not familiar with) and I was hoping that I could force the select product click when you click on container div
[12:33:36] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:33:40] <robertmaxrees> it's not written "in node"
[12:33:46] <robertmaxrees> the frontend code is all javascript.
[12:33:54] <robertmaxrees> without a dependency on your backend.
[12:34:31] <robertmaxrees> put differently, the code that handles the click event is frontend, not back.
[12:34:46] <WhirledPress> all of the examples given show how to scroll body, html   but none show how to scroll an element.
[12:34:56] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/
[12:35:07] <jak2000> click please on any cell, and click on other cell
[12:35:20] <jak2000> is horrible(i want close editable cell)
[12:35:43] <robertmaxrees> WhirledPress ah - then you probably want http://api.jquery.com/position/
[12:35:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of offset.
[12:35:54] <WhirledPress> tried both.
[12:35:57] <robertmaxrees> and then you target the element that can scroll for the element call.
[12:36:13] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 okay?
[12:36:21] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 what do you want me to do about it?
[12:37:06] <jak2000> every time you click on a cell...
[12:37:21] <jak2000> it open a input text, why not close the last and open the new?
[12:37:21] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i see what happens.  what are you asking for help on?
[12:37:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9KEGd/144/
[12:38:04] <robertmaxrees> because the other handler doesn't get called.
[12:38:05] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/2/
[12:38:31] <robertmaxrees> gotta update it.
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to change.
[12:39:57] <robertmaxrees> here's one approach: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9KEGd/144/
[12:40:07] <robertmaxrees> aaaand brb
[12:57:57] <robertmaxrees> aaaand back
[13:01:38] <jak2000> robertmaxrees!!!!
[13:01:45] <jak2000> check please: http://www.jqueryscript.net/table/Creating-A-Live-Editable-Table-with-jQuery-Tabledit.html
[13:01:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:01:54] <robertmaxrees> what am i checking?
[13:01:54] <jak2000> you see: $('#my-table').Tabledit({
[13:02:01] <jak2000> a table with edit...
[13:02:09] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:02:11] <robertmaxrees> what do you need?
[13:02:18] <jak2000> i understand #my-table is the id of my table.... right?
[13:02:29] <jak2000> what happend if my table was created at runtime?
[13:02:35] <jak2000> no problem with the name?
[13:02:56] <robertmaxrees> as long as you call this after the table is created, you're fine.
[13:03:07] <jak2000> ok
[13:03:18] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it?
[13:03:19] <jak2000> i write these lines at the top...
[13:03:38] <jak2000> and at this moment when page is loaded.... my-table not exist
[13:03:52] <robertmaxrees> you have to do it after it exists.
[13:04:10] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:04:14] <WhirledPress> when I get the offset of a div that I have styled with vh units, is my result in pixels or vh?
[13:04:25] <jak2000> mmmmmm
[13:04:31] <jak2000> checking
[13:05:17] <WhirledPress> jak2000, setup an event handler that knows when you table is created. Then add those lines.
[13:06:17] <jak2000> ok
[13:06:39] <jak2000> the table is created when user click on a button, this button call an ajax..... in the done? right?
[13:07:35] <WhirledPress> try it. But presumably your ajax call loads the table. So in the done, add if($ ("#my-table").length) { //do init stuff}
[13:07:45] <jak2000> ok
[13:14:05] <jak2000> ina fiddle, how to load a .js library? is possible?
[13:14:08] <jak2000> or?
[13:17:13] <WhirledPress> click on the cog in the js window and select jquery
[13:17:23] <WhirledPress> or enter in the external js field
[13:17:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:18:17] <WhirledPress> finally figured it out, you have to add the scrollTop of the div you want to scroll to the offset().top of the anchored element
[13:18:28] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.  makes sense.
[13:18:35] <robertmaxrees> sorry i wasn't able to kick it more.
[13:18:55] <WhirledPress> np you are always a great help
[13:52:09] <jak2000> robertmaxrees
[13:52:16] <jak2000> can you help me try understanding:
[13:52:38] <jak2000> http://markcell.github.io/jquery-tabledit/#examples
[13:54:02] <jak2000> hi taplar
[13:54:05] <jak2000> have 2 minutes?
[13:54:06] <jak2000> pls
[13:54:13] <jak2000> check the 6th sample....
[13:54:15] <taplar> what's up?
[13:54:29] <jak2000> Javascript code...
[13:55:19] <jak2000> onAjax: function(action, serialize) {  i send the parameters.... in serialize variable right?
[13:56:32] <taplar> i'm not sure where the ajax originates, but it looks like onAjax functions similarly to beforeSend in jQuery
[13:56:43] <hlve> onJak2000: function() { };
[13:56:55] <hlve> teehee
[13:57:12] <jak2000> my dude is how to send 1 variable more?
[13:57:15] <jak2000> how t
[13:57:15] <jak2000> o
[13:57:42] <taplar> you should be able to add it to the serialize i assume
[13:58:22] <jak2000> mmm how to ?
[13:59:13] <hlve> How to question mark :)
[13:59:41] <MikeD_> "Mark, where were you on the night of last night?"
[14:00:28] <MikeD_> you should probably have the additional form field in the form before you serialize it
[14:01:17] <taplar> yeah, not sure how you can change it since it's already in a string format
[14:02:01] <jak2000> see console pls
[14:02:14] <MikeD_> or if you're asking to add a 3rd parameter to the function, then you probably will want to parse the serialized data, add your additional content and reserialize before you give to xhr
[14:02:36] <jak2000> id=1&username=markcelltttt&email=markcell%40example.com&avatar=3&action=edit
[14:02:45] <jak2000> when i do: console.log(serialize);
[14:02:55] <taplar> according to the docs, onAjax only takes in action and serialize, not the xhr
[14:03:19] <taplar> so unless you can return the modified string and it will know to use that instead of the passed in serialize, not sure how you'd modify it
[14:03:34] <jak2000> Mike i use jsp... and have 1 session variable value that want pass ...
[14:03:36] <taplar> these docs aren't the best, :s
[14:07:14] <jak2000> arghh a simple task and cant
[14:07:30] <jak2000> taplar other plugin for edit values on html table?
[14:07:57] <taplar> i'm not familiar with any
[14:10:25] <taplar> if you wanted to you could edit the plugin to pass in the xhr, or the data as an object you can edit, or so you can return the modified serialized
[14:10:38] <taplar> https://github.com/markcell/jquery-tabledit/blob/master/jquery.tabledit.js#L372
[14:16:33] <jak2000> taplar need modify the plugin?
[14:16:55] <taplar> you could, if you wanted to
[14:17:07] <jak2000> onajax(action,serialized) i want add 1 variable more, static xAction='A2342AB'
[14:22:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rosym34g/
[14:22:31] <taplar> then just return the modified serialize from the onAjax
[14:25:36] <jak2000> done the change
[14:27:31] <cyjobes> Greetings - I have one of these on  my page - http://www.jqueryscript.net/chart-graph/Creating-Animated-Gauges-Using-jQuery-Raphael-js-kumaGauge.html - I want to dynamically change to another set of values. How would I do that?
[14:28:32] <jak2000> mmm changed the javascript code
[14:28:40] <jak2000> but the request.....is done
[14:28:42] <jak2000> why
[14:29:51] <taplar> make sure the updated plugin file has updated on the page and isn't still cached to previous version
[14:30:54] <jak2000> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/145/
[14:30:59] <jak2000> i am correct?
[14:31:32] <taplar> no, don't return serialize in there
[14:32:00] <taplar> you return the modified serialize in the onAjax you define in your applications setup
[14:32:20] <taplar> because line 10 is expecting it
[14:32:31] <taplar> comprende?
[14:33:12] <jak2000> reading
[14:34:18] <jak2000> first uncoment the lines: http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/146/
[14:34:18] <jak2000> right?
[14:34:24] <jak2000> error

[14:35:00] <arosen> Hi, Does anyone know where I can find some example code that implements a contenteditable that lets me add span elements to it with backspace deleting the element. Similar to how gmail works for it's to field for enter email addresses?
[14:35:39] <jak2000> ok
[14:36:09] <hlve> arosen, sec.
[14:36:46] <hlve> there's a type of element you're looking for, and it's on the tip of my tongue
[14:37:34] <arosen> hlve:  I'm trying to implement something similar to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17890568/contenteditable-div-backspace-and-deleting-text-node-problems
[14:37:50] <hlve> Look into something like tag-it.
[14:38:06] <hlve> http://xoxco.com/projects/code/tagsinput/example.html
[14:38:21] <hlve> There are better plugins than this, I just can't think of the one I'm looking for
[14:38:32] <jak2000> taplar.... it take the change.....
[14:38:48] <jak2000> but not happend anything
[14:39:12] <taplar> what are you doing in your onAjax?
[14:39:41] <arosen> hlve:  awesome thanks
[14:39:53] <jak2000> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/148/
[14:39:56] <hlve> you're welcome, arosen. that should be close to what you're looking for, right?
[14:40:02] <jak2000> line 89,90....
[14:40:10] <arosen> yup
[14:40:37] <taplar> i only got 43 lines
[14:41:35] <jak2000> sorry
[14:41:38] <jak2000> 30,31..
[14:42:05] <taplar> ok, so you are not changing or return the serialize in there
[14:43:04] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/150/
[14:44:26] <jak2000> 35 and 37 lines?
[14:44:42] <taplar> yeah, you gotta change it and return it
[14:45:25] <jak2000> ok.....
[14:46:31] <jak2000> and how to send to server?
[14:47:09] <taplar> that should do it.  changing the string will put it on there.  but strings are immutable, which is why we have to return it and have the plugin modified to get the returned value and use it
[14:47:25] <jak2000> ok
[14:47:26] <jak2000> checking
[14:48:18] <jak2000> :(
[14:51:04] <jak2000> testing.... i forgot remove the lines comented... on the file :)
[14:51:08] <jak2000> only removed on the fiddle
[14:51:12] <taplar> :)
[14:52:59] <jak2000> taplar...
[14:53:05] <jak2000> not send the variable:
[14:53:14] <jak2000> serialize = serialize + "&somethingelse=weeee";
[14:53:36] <jak2000> in JSP when i ask the value of the variable: "somethingelse" give me a null value
[14:53:50] <taplar> you included the return?
[14:54:34] <jak2000> yes, onAjax: function (action, serialize) { serialize = serialize + "&somethingelse=weeee";            return serialize;}
[14:54:46] <jak2000> String xaction = request.getParameter("action");   <---- give me the value 'edit'
[14:55:13] <jak2000> but: String somethingelse = request.getParameter("somethingelse");  give me null value...
[14:55:16] <taplar> https://github.com/markcell/jquery-tabledit/blob/master/jquery.tabledit.js#L385   put a console.log(serialize); there and see what it prints out
[14:55:33] <jak2000> k
[14:57:12] <jak2000> testing this: http://jsfiddle.net/9KEGd/151/
[14:57:25] <jak2000> and checking the value of: console.log(serialize);
[14:57:35] <taplar> yeah

[14:58:59] <taplar> huh
[14:59:14] <wahibdon> why is the jquery version of a standard number input called a spinner?
[14:59:26] <wahibdon> this is really bugging me and it is impossible to google.
[14:59:43] <taplar> wahibdon: what are you talking about?
[14:59:55] <jak2000> taplar any advice?
[15:00:16] <jak2000> taplar i send a pm escuse me
[15:13:38] <wahibdon> taplar, https://jqueryui.com/spinner/
[15:15:04] <wahibdon> taplar, but they aren't the only ones.  I also ran across this:  http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/input/spinner.xhtml
[15:15:45] <taplar> ah, only thing i can think of is someone thought it made them think of some sort of spinner that the numbers were on.  think of the big wheel on price is right
[15:16:23] <taplar> also i think number inputs have a specific interface on iphone and android that may have led to that name
[15:17:37] <wahibdon> yah, a number pad pops up instead of a full keyboard.  It just seemed like a weird name and while your explanation makes sense, it is a bit of a stretch.  But maybe this is just a "This is how it is, get the f over it" kind of situation.
[15:17:59] <taplar> checkout the overflow example.
[15:19:00] <wahibdon> yeah, could be likened to a wheel.  Ugh.  thanks.  have a good one.'
[15:19:07] <taplar> you 2
[15:31:30] <mint_tea> Hello, I am having problems searching for, and selecting an element with a substring of text in a data attribute. Here is my current approach: $("a").find("[data*='"someText"]').css('color', 'red');
[15:31:48] <robertmaxrees> just use filter imo.
[15:33:40] <mint_tea> Looking it up...
[15:34:27] <robertmaxrees> also, kind of interesting that you don't know the name of the data attribute.
[15:34:54] <mint_tea> Well, I do, i just wrote it this way for demo purposes
[15:35:13] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, just use .filter() with a function imo.
[15:35:33] <mint_tea> Ok thanks
[15:35:39] <robertmaxrees> .filter(function() { return $(this).data('thename') === 'sometext' });
[15:39:58] <robertmaxrees> oh also your original bug was because you weren't concatenating strings correctly.
[15:40:12] <mint_tea> ?
[15:41:12] <robertmaxrees>  $("a").find("[data*='" + someText + "]') - gotta use +
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> instead of just sticking the var in here.
[15:41:43] <mint_tea> Oh ok
[16:11:23] <jak2000> taplar hi

[16:46:11] <BSaboia> hello everyone. I am using JQuery UI autocomplete. it's working fine, but only if my webservice already return a json with label and id (lowercase). how can I put it to work if, say, my remote webservice returns a JSON like [{Id: 1, Name: "Some name"}, {Id: 2, Name: "Yeat another name" }]  ?
[16:48:47] <taplar> BSaboia: have you tried implementing logic like the custom data demo?
[16:50:52] <BSaboia> taplar, no, thanks. it seems that the key lies on the _renderItem private function
[16:51:00] <jak2000> taplar checked and checed
[16:51:04] <jak2000> same lines changed....
[16:52:31] <BSaboia> taplar, that did the trick
[16:52:33] <BSaboia> thanks a lot
[16:52:38] <taplar> BSaboia: cool
[16:53:20] <taplar> jak2000: i'm pretty sure you are since you are seeing the console logs, but just to make sure.  you are including the non-min file and not the min file right?
[16:56:32] <jak2000> ye no
[16:56:33] <jak2000> min file
[16:56:36] <jak2000> yes no min file
[16:57:17] <taplar> ok, so, try this, add a console.log(result) right before the if (result === false)
[17:00:44] <jak2000> i add: var result = settings.onAjax(action, serialize);   console.log("====== ", result);  if (result === false) {
[17:00:46] <jak2000> console say:
[17:00:52] <jak2000> ======  undefined
[17:38:19] <Darmani> Hi everyone! I'm trying to parse a string into HTML and check if a div class is inside but I'm not sure how to do that.
[17:38:45] <Darmani> So far I have an ajax call that returns a string (data), and I've done $.parseHTML(data)
[17:38:50] <Darmani> But I'm not sure what to do after that.
[18:08:32] <taplar> Darmani: var $temp = $(data);  $temp.find('...')
[18:12:50] <Darmani> taplar: Thanks man :)
[18:32:43] <MACscr> So I am using bootstrap colorpicker (https://itsjavi.com/bootstrap-colorpicker/) on an input field to select a background color. I want to automatically set that new color as the bg within a div whenever the color is changed by manual input or within the colorpicker. Any adivce?
[18:33:11] <taplar> bind a change event to it
[18:33:38] <taplar> is that a plugin?  it may have a custom change hook in it
[18:34:17] <taplar> "changeColor  This event is fired when the color is changed."
[18:36:52] <MACscr> taplar i would need to tie it to a separate event as well if the user manually inputted a value into the input form as well. Right?
[18:37:10] <taplar> you'd have to play with that and see
[18:41:22] <MACscr> taplar thanks. I think im going to not worry about that for now. The ChangeColor event worked great though
[19:11:16] <Darmani> I'm trying to get the value from a form but it keeps coming back with an empty string :[
[19:11:18] <Darmani> $('#event_start_date_time').val()
[19:36:58] <acidjazz> Darmani: what does $('#event_start_date_time').length give you
[19:37:21] <Darmani> acidjazz: hm. haven't tried that let me check
[20:47:44] <WhirledPress> can you listen for the scroll event on the document or only on the element that scrolls (presuming the document, html, body do not scroll)?
[20:50:26] <robertmaxrees> you mean does the event bubble?
[20:50:48] <WhirledPress> oh sure, make it easy...lol yes...sorry
[20:51:01] <robertmaxrees> easy to test via a fiddle :)
[20:52:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/h0g6orav/
[21:01:21] <WhirledPress> thank you. I wanted to know what would happen if you used mousewheel to scroll a non-scrollable div: https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/h0g6orav/1/
[21:03:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean while scrolling on an element?
[21:04:39] <robertmaxrees> WhirledPress because there's a distinction between scroll and mousewheel.
[21:05:01] <WhirledPress> I was just able to discern that.
[21:05:10] <robertmaxrees> heh.  you can use wheel instea.d
[21:05:24] <robertmaxrees> *instead.  though then i gotta ask - what're you building?
[21:05:38] <WhirledPress> I have a nested scrollable "section" element inside the "main" element which is also scrollable.
[21:06:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just have a scrollable window?
[21:06:16] <WhirledPress> I am capturing the scrolle event for the sections and when yuou scroll to the end, the parent scrolls to the next section
[21:07:03] <WhirledPress> because of how I have the header for each section isolated. I can show you the ROUGH draft of what I am working on, but promise not to be too harsh...lol
[21:07:27] <robertmaxrees> nah
[21:07:30] <robertmaxrees> don't need to see it.
[21:07:37] <robertmaxrees> just seems like a lotta work for minimal benefit.
[21:07:50] <robertmaxrees> could just use the main window scroll event and then one of those sticky element plugins, but meh.
[21:07:51] <WhirledPress> could be. I'm learning.
[21:09:00] <WhirledPress> basically, by constraining the sections to the hieght of the viewport* I can make it so they "snap" to the top for each section.
[21:09:36] <WhirledPress> if you scroll half the height of the section, it animates to the top of the next section.
[22:22:07] <MACscr> Ok, another thing im working on. Im making this little editor http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/11/. So far is working great, but I need to somehow save the generated html that was created within the <div class="stage"></div> minus the drag/resize wrappers it adds. Any suggestions?
[23:59:00] <jak2000> robertmaxrees?
[23:59:04] <jak2000> want a cigarette?
