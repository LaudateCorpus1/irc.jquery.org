[10:28:49] <jak2000> follow me please, run: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/vHvLh/75/
[10:28:57] <jak2000> click on button 1,1 what happend?
[10:29:02] <loki_42> But I came here because  I have a little problem. I wanted to use $().resizable on a div, but it doen't work, there is no error message neither. It may be useful to say that I use angular JS also. code here : https://jsfiddle.net/8menck25/
[10:32:23] <decx> are you trying to make 1,1 2,1 white?
[10:37:47] <jak2000> yes
[10:37:59] <jak2000> decx but if you pressing button 1,3 not coloring cell 2,3
[10:38:11] <jak2000> i think my problem is in get the correct index()
[10:38:16] <decx> because you use the wrong index
[10:39:02] <jak2000> done
[10:39:21] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/vHvLh/76/
[10:41:07] <decx> but what if you click 2,2
[10:41:15] <decx> do you not want 1,2 to be white then too
[10:41:47] <decx> currentRow doesnt have a closest td
[10:42:06] <jak2000> yes fail :(
[10:42:19] <decx> use currentCell index and filter all td
[10:42:25] <jak2000> how to solve?
[10:42:59] <jak2000> done: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/vHvLh/77/
[10:43:04] <jak2000> testes in 3 buttons
[10:43:14] <decx> but what if i click 2,2
[10:44:13] <jak2000> work
[10:44:25] <decx> shouldnt it select 1,2?
[10:44:34] <jak2000> no,
[10:44:48] <jak2000> the job is done, thanks decx
[10:45:16] <decx> weird
[10:51:16] <jak2000> reall i have a matrix 10x10 the last row havent the button
[10:56:11] <A124> I so suck with jquery I don't really get it.
[10:56:43] <A124> Can someone please show me how to simulate a mouse click on "Load ... more images" on imgur.com gallery?
[10:56:59] <A124> $(".post-loadall.btn.btn-action").trigger() does nothing
[11:06:05] <A124> Nevermind, somehow magically it did not work. Installed Firebug and now it works in both Firebug and Developers Console: $(".post-loadall.btn.btn-action").click()
[11:07:48] <decx> you .trigger('click') anyway, not just .trigger()
[13:18:49] <Onionnion> how can I go about adjusting the size of a Slider widget, as-in the handle
[13:27:02] <Onionnion> scratch that, found it
[13:31:56] <Dschingiz> How is it that after caching an element ... like var currP = $(this).next("p").html(); ... I cannot do currP.find("b").text?
[13:32:21] <Dschingiz> Am i missing something here?
[13:38:26] <Uhkis> Dschingiz: after .html() you have a string, not a jquery object
[13:39:20] <Dschingiz> Oh I see.
[13:39:30] <Dschingiz> So just omitting the html function should do the job, right?
[13:39:37] <Uhkis> Dschingiz: yup
[13:39:44] <Dschingiz> Cheers!
[13:47:02] <Onionnion> I'm trying to figure out what causes the sort of "selection" or "active" box around the slider handle when it gets clicked or touched http://codepen.io/ryanbreaker/pen/LRkXJP
[13:47:17] <Onionnion> any ideas what the styling or property for that is?
[13:53:02] <decx> check the inspector
[13:53:14] <decx> .ui-state-focus .ui-state-hover
[13:58:46] <Onionnion> ah, found it
[13:58:54] <Onionnion> was just a user agent thing, adding an outline
[14:15:07] <luound> hello, i have a preloader in a page, i want to execute a script after that preloader fades out, how can I do that?
[15:02:41] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/uL6ozwmf/   in this fiddle the cells backgroud was painted with blue, right? this html code was generated by an ajax and assigned to a div:  document.getElementById("xMapaSala").innerHTML = json.xhtml;      when return the html isnt painted the cells.... why?
[15:26:11] <momomo> transitionEnd doesnt always seem to fire .. why is that so ? both in ff and chrome
[16:13:40] <ircbaao> hi has anyone used html 5 video tag before please
[16:27:39] <sillyslux> is that baako? :P
[16:27:43] <sillyslux> ellou
[16:28:08] <sillyslux> i did something with video and it was a horrible experience
[16:37:35] <Aljone> hey guys i have <div class="step"></div><div class="step skip"><div class="step"></div> , var current_page = my first dive and im trying to do that current_page.next(".step:not(.skip)") but it doesnt catch the element after skip.. ideas?
[17:09:36] <hellyeah> how can i use "hover" event on div
[17:09:38] <hellyeah> ?
[17:10:10] <hellyeah> that doesnt work https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/k3p88La2/ can you tell me how can i fix?
[17:14:23] <arc_> change it to mouseover
[17:14:47] <hellyeah> correct event is mouseover yes i found
[17:15:00] <hellyeah> but what is the reason "hover" event didnt work?
[17:15:23] <arc_> hover is a css thing. it's not an event
[17:16:08] <hellyeah> ic
[17:19:42] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/mkmxr91g/
[17:19:52] <hellyeah> what is wrong here?
[17:20:03] <hellyeah> i am sorry for asking simple question
[17:25:45] <RottenCore> it’ like a ghost town here on the weekends, man
[17:26:13] <arc_> hellyeah look at your console. you must be pretty tired right now
[17:26:23] <arc_> there's a typo in your selector
[17:26:54] <arc_> also 'additional' is spelled as 'adittional'
[17:27:16] <arc_> i see it's spelled the same way both times but you should probably spell it right so you don't mess it up in the future
[17:27:59] <hellyeah> arc_:  i did that https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/mkmxr91g/1/
[17:28:21] <hellyeah> thanks for correction
[17:28:32] <arc_> ok. you should still use toggleClass though
[17:31:40] <hellyeah> for the records, mouseenter, mouseleave and addClass, removeClass would do same thing isnt it?
[17:32:01] <RottenCore> Here’s one for you kids: https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landing-mobile
[17:32:25] <RottenCore> it’s a multi-part form
[17:32:43] <RottenCore> when a radio button is selected, i want the form to advance without the user having to press “next”
[17:32:51] <hellyeah> it adds "aidttional" when you mouseover and when you mouseover it remove the class
[17:32:56] <RottenCore> I tried onchange='this.form.next() but it doesn’t work’
[17:33:22] <RottenCore> i’m using this pre-packaged jquery: http://www.jqueryscript.net/form/Creating-A-Modern-Multi-Step-Form-with-jQuery-CSS3.html
[17:33:24] <RottenCore> any ideas?
[18:24:52] <ircbaao> hi guys i dont know who to turn to for this html or you lovely guys. When i access my site on IE. it added some divs with a style of "height: 448px; vertical-align: baseline; display: block; position: relative; float: left;" how do i disable this?
[19:15:05] <fkees> hey this is kind of a general javascript question, but i'm not registered, where can I learn how to structure my programs to use import / export and general artchitecture, my stuff is getting big enough that I'm getting conufsed and need better organization
[19:42:24] <RottenCore> anyone home?
[19:53:02] <sliter> So, ok, i don't quite well get the situation
[19:53:13] <sliter> I have array of elements, which is "children" of another
[19:53:58] <sliter> So, el.attr or el.find works perfect
[19:54:20] <sliter> But el[0].find and el[0].attr returns undefined
[19:58:38] <sliter> Someone?
[20:08:21] <sliter> Even after el.find('div')[0] i can't use attr!
[20:08:24] <sliter> What's the problem?
[20:14:18] <ircbaao> am grtting this error on safari "Syntax error, unrecongnized expression:input[name="amount"
[21:21:53] <RottenCore> anyone home?
[22:47:30] <zzo38> Someone told me that you can use jQuery without HTML. Is that correct, and how? Can you query arbitrary JSON data that has been parsed into a JavaScript object?
[22:48:56] <zzo38> As far as I can tell it is not true.
