[14:55:42] <warmrobert> hello i'm trying to simulate clicking on a div. the div is <div data-grammarly-part="gbutton"> and i'm trying to tie clicking it to a html button <input type="button" onclick="$('*[data-grammarly-part]').click()"/>
[14:56:30] <warmrobert> however my jquery selector doesnt work, if i add ="gbutton" inside the selector i get invalid syntax/unexpected token
[14:56:56] <warmrobert> just looking for any advice here, im not sure how else i can try to select that div
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> first off - why are you doing the js inline?
[14:57:12] <warmrobert> all that needs to be done is simulating a click of that div
[14:57:20] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[14:57:25] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing the js inline?
[14:57:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:57:31] <warmrobert> to simulate a click of that div
[15:00:36] <warmrobert> do you mention this because it might be the reason my selector doesnt work?
[15:00:43] <warmrobert> im sorry, i just dont follow
[15:01:14] <robertmaxrees> using onclick inside html is inefficient and an antipattern.  you should be sticking your js in js files.
[15:01:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/39jxpw8t/1/
[15:01:58] <robertmaxrees> but also: triggering click event handlers is a roundabout way to run code.  why not abstract the handler for the div and call the function directly instead?
[15:02:34] <warmrobert> the grammarly plugin im trying to select has a bug where sometimes the button is drawn off screen
[15:02:42] <warmrobert> my idea was "well ill just add a button myself"
[15:02:55] <warmrobert> so simulating a click seemed like the most straight forward way
[15:02:59] <robertmaxrees> heh, second issue - triggering js handlers via jquery won't always work.
[15:03:33] <robertmaxrees> if $('[data-grammarly-part]').trigger('click'); doesn't work, then that is likely your issue
[15:11:53] <warmrobert> yup. theres no errors anymore but nothing happens
[15:12:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  sounds like that's your issue then.
[15:12:20] <warmrobert> thank you very much for your time.its probably best i not try this dumb hack and just report a bug to the addon people
[15:12:31] <robertmaxrees> that's a great idea :)
[15:13:14] <warmrobert> you did help me learn how to select elements based off of data attributes though. i was convinced i needed the ="gbutton" part
[15:13:22] <warmrobert> but as your jsfiddle shows, it was selecting correctly all along
[15:13:30] <robertmaxrees> you can do it both ways.
[15:13:37] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use * :)
[15:18:23] <warmrobert> yeah... that was a result of just copy and pasting stuff of google and praying it worked
[15:18:32] <robertmaxrees> All good :)
