[04:04:35] <paule32_> hello
[04:04:53] <paule32_> i ask me self, how to implement a login system in javascript
[04:05:05] <paule32_> javascript is execute at back-end
[04:05:26] <paule32_> so, the user can look to code, and trickery bypass the login
[04:06:08] <paule32_> the using php is the same - it is server based, but the data must be transfer to user
[04:06:52] <paule32_> so my question is, how to implement _secure_  login system ?
[05:01:27] <paule32> hello
[05:01:53] <paule32> i have use $.post to get _javascript_ code by remote file
[05:02:00] <paule32> so far, so good
[05:02:22] <paule32> how can i insert this code into javascript script/code?
[06:08:57] <thykka> paule32, depends.. If you're loading the file from the same domain, you should be able to just create a <script> element and set the script source as the element's html
[06:09:25] <thykka> not that I'd recommend it though :P
[06:10:08] <paule32> np
[06:13:27] <thykka> paule32, as for your previous question.. Yeah, there's no way to make a secure login with frontend code only. What you want is to first take the user's password when they create their account, use the password to generate a secure hash, with a secret salt included. You store this hash, and throw the password away. Then when the user wants to login, you again generate a hash from the password they're trying to
[06:13:29] <thykka> log in with, and if it matches the previous hash, the password is correct, and they can be let in
[06:14:06] <thykka> but then you'll need something to make the login persist, unless you want the user to send their password in every request.. For that you'd use a token system..
[06:14:23] <paule32> a token
[06:14:32] <paule32> ok
[06:14:36] <thykka> but this is all quite complex and easy to get wrong, so I strongly suggest not implementing it on your own, unless you know exactly what you're doing
[06:15:11] <paule32> are sessions cookies?
[06:15:25] <paule32> where are stored the items of $_SESSION
[06:15:35] <paule32> plain?
[06:15:57] <thykka> that sounds like PHP, i'm sure it's documented
[06:17:42] <paule32> some docus explain, that attacker can get session id per guessing, but i shall secure per using cookies
[06:17:43] <paule32> ?
[06:18:32] <thykka> session id doesn't matter if you're using tokens (i think..)
[06:20:07] <thykka> yeah, no, you don't want both sessionID and tokens. Pick one (preferably tokens)
[06:20:32] <paule32> ok
[06:21:38] <thykka> paule32, there's a PHP token encoder/decoder available, https://coderwall.com/p/8wrxfw/goodbye-php-sessions-hello-json-web-tokens
[06:23:08] <paule32> thx
[07:58:49] <holarctic> hi, I need help with converting div structure into json. Here is an example of html and code that doesn't work as intended https://jsfiddle.net/4en02v5z/. I want to select only the top level div in the context so I can recursively call the function and get the tree of categories and subjects. Is there a better way of doing this?
[08:01:23] <holarctic> note, I forgot to return tree variable at the end. Here is updated version https://jsfiddle.net/4en02v5z/1/
[23:42:48] <destinydriven> Hey guys
[23:44:39] <destinydriven> I'm trying to append a new table row right after a tr which contains a link with data-id  using .appendTo(dailyHoursNewRow)  .insertAfter($(this).parents().closest('tr'))
[23:45:33] <destinydriven> Using the above works but apparently it leads to multiple rows being added on subsequent single clicks because it's not making use if the data-id of the button clicked
[23:46:05] <destinydriven> How can I modify this to find the tr > td > a (with data-id)?
