[12:18:50] <jquirino> Hi guys, I have a problem with firefox on OSX. I want to open a pdf in a dialog, it's working on every browser but only in FF for mac the dialog opens empty and the pdf is downloaded. Why this behaviour?
[12:19:29] <Sayona> Hi, how i validate with jquery.validate.min.js the input contain at the begin some string text?
[19:44:59] <ClydeSlims> I can't get my scrollToTop button to show up in Firefox. It works in chrome though: https://jsfiddle.net/r2h43jzw/
[19:53:28] <ClydeSlims> I believe fadeIn() and fadeOut() isn't working in Firefox, not sure why.
[19:58:07] <snover> use `window` or `document`, not `document.body`
[20:01:13] <ClydeSlims> snover, thank you!
