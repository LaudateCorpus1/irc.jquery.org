[01:02:20] <James-> hello
[01:02:27] <James-> i have a problem with a sortable
[01:03:16] <James-> http://pastie.org/2071101        and   my js : http://pastie.org/2071099
[01:04:08] <James-> when i put sortable, js not work
[01:04:20] <James-> but if sortable is empty this work
[01:09:58] <James-> help plz ?
[01:15:35] <albacker> hello, is the slider buggy?
[01:16:23] <djQuery> NuckingFuts: well seeing how ready only fires one time why would u ever need to unbind it?
[01:17:04] <djQuery> James- dont pm me that is how people get added to my ignore list
[01:17:09] <albacker> i'm creating the slider suing $('#foo').slider({slide:function(event, ui){ alert(ui.value);}});  and once i move the slider it keeps alerting.. (i move the slider, it alerts! everything ok! than as soon as i move the mouse it alerts again.. like the mouse key is pressed or something)
[01:17:19] <daxroc> Morning all
[01:17:47] <djQuery> albacker: that will happen if you move the moust out of the viewport
[01:17:52] <James-> ok
[01:18:04] <albacker> djQuery, what is the viewport?
[01:18:17] <djQuery> albacker: and for criss sake use console.log instead of alert
[01:18:34] <James-> so what s the problem djQuery ?  http://pastie.org/2071101        and   my js : http://pastie.org/2071099
[01:18:42] <djQuery> albacker: out of the window.
[01:18:50] <albacker> but im not moving it out of the window
[01:18:53] <djQuery> James- put together a working example
[01:18:58] <daxroc> Would there be a more efficient way to target an element in $.each than , $('.distance',$('#postToPost tbody tr')[index]).empty().html(data.Distance.km);
[01:19:12] <djQuery> albacker: no but ur losing focus of the element because of the stupid alert
[01:20:12] <albacker> djQuery, you might be right.. there's a difference between the behaviour while using alert and while not using it. I'm going to use console.log and try to debug. thanks for the help.
[01:21:09] <James-> djQuery   this work : http://pastie.org/2071145   but no update, , this not work : http://pastie.org/2071150
[01:22:01] <djQuery> James- with a pastie you cant realy test it out put together a fiddle and you will get better responses
[01:22:21] <James-> how so ?
[01:23:35] <daxroc> James a working or broken example if far better than a static paste  ( jsFiddle )
[01:24:00] <djQuery> james- have you ever even been to jsfiddle.net?
[01:24:49] <djQuery> James-: here I will even give you a head start this has everything you  need in it allready just click the fork button and put in ur code
[01:24:49] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/YbndA/
[01:26:56] <James-> ok thx
[01:28:13] <James-> yes but djQuery this not load php file for update database
[01:28:22] <James-> how can i do ?
[01:28:49] <djQuery> well neither would your pastie whats ur point?
[01:29:14] <James-> .load
[01:29:27] <djQuery> james- which part are u haveing prob with sortable or load?
[01:29:39] <James-> load in sortable
[01:29:54] <djQuery> instead of doing a load just console.log the seirialized item
[01:31:18] <djQuery> oh yeah and you can do .load('url', {order-item: $(this).sortable('serialize')})
[01:31:38] <James-> ok i test it

[02:08:40] <duttonstuart> I am wondering how to add a stylesheet to a php file that I have called in a modal box.
[02:09:17] <duttonstuart> I am sure its .addclass or somehing like that or .css but just wondering..  its a two second job I imagine..
[02:10:25] <duttonstuart> I am calling this...  $('#contact').load('/contact/contactform.php');  which is my contact form and my css file for it is in /contact/contact.css
[02:10:48] <duttonstuart> how would I add the stylesheet to the contact form?
[02:10:50] <spir> Hello. How could I make this work? http://jsbin.com/ojiyo5/edit ie: exand all ul/li to make the current (a.current) link displayed? Every ul/li are hidden at first but the top level.
[02:11:31] <duttonstuart> I am just learning jquery at the moment and would appreciate some advice.
[02:12:05] <duttonstuart> the form opens in a modal box but I just need to add the stylesheet for the form so it looks right inside the modal box
[02:12:08] <spir> duttonstuart>$('head').append('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/contact/contact.css" media="screen">
[02:12:15] <spir> ');
[02:12:35] <daffodil> spir:  I am trying to do vertical navigation but in my 16inch screen,i get that page landing correctly when i navigate but if screen size increses it is also showing previous div content
[02:12:46] <spir> duttonstuart>What about loading the CSS in any case when the page is loaded?
[02:13:25] <duttonstuart> the css would be loaded on page load but I want to call it for this form
[02:15:58] <daffodil> spir: Can you help me out in .animate()
[02:16:16] <djQuery> James-: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/FKLMC/7/
[02:16:51] <djQuery> daffodil: sounds like u need to bind to the window.onresize
[02:16:53] <duttonstuart> scrap that.. just me being an idiot.. I hadnt loaded the stylesheet
[02:17:00] <James-> thanks
[02:17:06] <duttonstuart> sorry spir
[02:18:53] <na3r> how can i parse this json? [{'id':'18','title':'دوچرخه'},{'id':'20','title':'we'}]
[02:19:23] <djQuery> well with those none utf8 characters in it its not valid json
[02:20:06] <daffodil> djQuery: But how do i use that in my code
[02:20:13] <sebasmagri> Hi! What event should I use if I want to populate a <select> just before the options list shows up?
[02:20:33] <na3r> djQuery, well what about [{'id':'18'},{'id':'20'}]?
[02:20:35] <daffodil> djQuery: for anchor tags i have a function.In that function i wrote a code whic i previously posted it to u
[02:20:48] <djQuery> and it would be better if it were like {"list": [{"id": 1, "title": "whatever"}, etc]}
[02:20:48] <blackspotwiggins> na3r, json uses double quotes
[02:21:00] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise the first example is fine
[02:21:02] <djQuery> then you could just do a loop over them
[02:21:20] <na3r> so how>
[02:21:22] <sebasmagri> I've been trying with click, blur, focus, but it doesn't works well... I need to open the select several times for it to show options...
[02:21:35] <blackspotwiggins> na3r, use double quotes instead of single quotes
[02:21:49] <sebasmagri> I get the options via AJAX...
[02:21:50] <djQuery> na3r: http://jssonlint.com
[02:21:52] <daffodil> djQuery: To whom you are telling it>
[02:22:21] <daffodil> djQuery: ?
[02:22:53] <spir> How could I make this work? http://jsbin.com/ojiyo5/edit ie: expand all ul/li to make the current (a.current) link displayed? Every ul/li are hidden at first but the top level.
[02:23:13] <spir> http://jsbin.com/ojiyo5/2
[02:23:36] <djQuery> spir: have you looked at ui.menubar?
[02:23:58] <spir> djQuery>Nope
[02:24:01] <daffodil> djQuery: where am i going wrong?
[02:24:09] <spir> djQuery>I'm checking this thx
[02:24:32] <djQuery> spir: its still beta but ...
[02:24:57] <djQuery> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/38666403/Menubar
[02:25:48] <spir> djQuery>I just checked
[02:25:54] <spir> djQuery>this is not what I want to do
[02:26:12] <spir> djQuery>I have a set of ul /li (arbo) I want to display in sidebar
[02:26:26] <spir> code is almost done
[02:29:03] <djQuery> spir:
[02:29:05] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/nfbke/
[02:29:53] <spir> djQuery> That what I've done so fat : http://jsbin.com/ojiyo5/2 (quite like your example)
[02:30:24] <spir> What I want is that onload it expand the ul/li automatically of the li that contains link with class set to current
[02:30:39] <spir> "$("div.menu li a.current").parent().find("ul").slideToggle("slow");"
[02:30:48] <spir> this works when only one level
[02:30:59] <spir> I'm stuck with n levels of ul / li
[02:32:42] <daniel3> So I just wanted a verification.  I have a file that validates input using php.  I want the input to be validated automatically after a user clicks out of the input box.  In order to do that, I could just use a onblur even with the load function, would that be good?
[02:34:28] <Over|taf> anyway to parse value to child window input with jquery and window open ?
[02:35:52] <daffodil> Over|taf:  I am trying to do vertical navigation but in my 16inch screen,i get that page landing correctly when i navigate but if screen size increses it is also showing previous div content
[02:39:41] <daffodil> Have any one used this kind of navigation alfredapp.com
[02:40:15] <daffodil> i m struck with this screen resoultion problem
[02:41:25] <daffodil> niko have you done vertical navigation
[02:43:46] <James-> djQuery    http://jsfiddle.net/FKLMC/8/    In your exemple  JS work but    php is not load what s the problem ?
[02:45:48] <daffodil> James have you worked with .animate()
[02:46:31] <seutje> hmm, odd... a .closest('label') call is causing a recursion error :/
[02:49:19] <joshua__> I keep getting "attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope" in my firebug, anyone know what this is?
[02:52:22] <topcat> Why can't I change an input type with $cache.attr('type', 'password'); I keep getting -- Uncaught type property can't be changed
[02:52:41] <gnarf> topcat: because you can't change the type property after the input is created in in
[02:52:44] <gnarf> in ie
[02:52:52] <topcat> or chrome apparently
[02:53:01] <blackspotwiggins> afaik it doesnt work in firefox either
[02:53:10] <gnarf> $("<input type='password'>")
[02:53:17] <gnarf> then decorate it with the val from the old one
[02:53:40] <gnarf> annoying
[02:53:49] <gnarf> but so is changing input types
[02:53:53] <gnarf> if you are tyring to do a placehold
[02:54:05] <topcat> as in remove the input t=text and add input t=pass with the val() saved ?
[02:54:07] <gnarf> consider just using the HTML5 "placeholder"
[02:54:48] <topcat> I want ie7 compatability
[02:54:48] <gnarf> topcat: yeah, you're gonna have to set the name attr, and a few others as well (maybe id / classes)
[02:54:59] <topcat> ah yes.
[02:55:09] <gnarf> topcat: for the placeholder even? thats just getting cooky
[02:55:27] <gnarf> its not going to look right on a password element anyway
[02:55:40] <gnarf> when you focus it, your gonna have to replace it with the original password element
[02:55:40] <gnarf> etc
[02:55:49] <topcat> spec says I shouldn't use it instead of a label too. which is what i'm doing
[02:56:12] <gnarf> use a label then...
[02:56:41] <topcat> Maybe I'll just leave username and a blank label and login button. seems obvious enough. Thanks for clearing that up anyway
[02:56:50] <topcat> is it only the type attribute I can't change?
[02:56:59] <gnarf> pretty much
[02:57:04] <gnarf> some others are read only
[02:57:09] <gnarf> but i can't think of em
[02:57:21] <topcat> oh ok
[03:03:02] <daffodil> have any one used .animae()
[03:03:24] <daffodil> what does .offset() do
[03:03:56] <joshua__> ?offset @ daffodil
[03:03:57] <topcat> can I jsut keep using $(this).whatever in a function or is it better to $cache = $(this); $cache.whatever
[03:04:00] <Over|taf> $("#divID").offset().top
[03:04:13] <Over|taf> give height in pixels between document top and div
[03:04:36] <daffodil> Over|taf:  $(").offset().top-100}, 700); can you explain what this does?
[03:05:17] <daffodil> joshua__: @ do not know the answer
[03:09:51] <duttonstuart> does anyone know the answer to this. I load a php into a modal box but the close button dissapears as it sits in the Div but outside of the jquery .. <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>
[03:10:08] <duttonstuart> How do I add this into the script so its all in one place?
[03:10:29] <duttonstuart> this close event  is part of the reveal modal script
[03:16:06] <duttonstuart> i will post the lines, there are only a few
[03:16:10] <duttonstuart> <div id="contact" class="reveal-modal">
[03:16:28] <duttonstuart> <script type="text/javascript">
[03:16:41] <duttonstuart> $('#contact').load('/contact/contactform.php');
[03:16:51] <markj> ?p @ duttonstuart
[03:17:05] <markj> urgh, bloody bot
[03:17:11] <markj> http://jsfiddle.net
[03:18:36] <duttonstuart> question is how do I get the close item which is <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a> to show up as it dissapears when I put the php in the modal box
[03:18:50] <duttonstuart> <a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a> is part of he modal function
[03:19:14] <duttonstuart> its just a close button for the event
[03:22:53] <topcat> is there some default spacing around input elements no matter what I set to 0? they have to have a negative margin to touch?
[03:25:21] <daffodil> how to see my previous chat messages
[03:28:25] <daffodil> .animate({scrollTop: $("").offset().top-100}, 800); what does this means?
[03:37:14] <crab> hi. is there any easy way to exclude one variable from someForm.serialize()?
[03:38:04] <mazzachre> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/2YfYF/ Can anyone help me on not getting {"":"undefined"} when no query arguments are ready?
[03:38:33] <mazzachre> crab: Only by afterwards setting them... var x = someForm.serialize(); x.someVal="";
[03:38:58] <crab> er, what?
[03:39:08] <crab> oh, you're thinking of serializeArray.
[03:39:23] <mazzachre> crab: Ya, sry... Uhm then, no
[03:39:29] <mazzachre> not that I know of
[03:41:22] <topcat> Has anyone used innerfade.js ?
[03:43:48] <crab> well, then f.find('input[name=thatfield]')[0].disabled=true; f.serialize(); ...disabled = false; it is then
[03:44:58] <Lest> in jQuery, how can i know if a checked box is checked ?
[03:45:41] <Lest> i do that : $("#muCheckBox").val() but that always return the value when my box is check
[03:46:22] <crab> .is(":checked")
[03:46:32] <Lest> crab, ok thx
[03:59:49] <someGuy> Guys, is it possible to use a get request on a page which returns html and then use jquery selectors as normal on that returned html?
[04:00:22] <aminpy> how can I get tag value like <span>...</span>
[04:00:24] <aminpy> ?
[04:00:26] <someGuy> i.e. access the variable like it was the dom
[04:04:19] <wbednarski> what is the best google maps plugin for jQuery?
[04:06:00] <seutje> ugh, never trust PHP folks to mess with ur javamascripts -_-
[04:06:06] <Jayflux> test
[04:11:13] <owzzz> Can anyone tell me why this would be returning null?
[04:11:15] <owzzz> $.data('.pause', "state", "notPaused");
[04:11:28] <owzzz> console.log($.data('.pause', 'state'));
[04:11:47] <crab> what does $('.pause') do?
[04:11:58] <larsemil> i am looking into .load and need to get an form from a poorly written homepage (almost no classes or id, just tables. on one place in code there is an <!-- COMMENT --> could i use this as "start getting content from here" ?
[04:11:59] <owzzz> .pause is a pause button for a carousel
[04:12:03] <crab> is there any way to re-display a datepicker? is calling .datePicker() on the div enough?
[04:12:05] <owzzz> Im trying to check the state
[04:12:24] <owzzz> and if the state is a certain value play the carousel
[04:12:36] <owzzz> if notPaused
[04:12:40] <owzzz> on click then pause it
[04:12:41] <crab> owzzz: does $('.pause') actually return the element you expect it to?
[04:12:41] <Cork> larsemil: no comment isn't searchable
[04:12:54] <larsemil> Cork: how then to search and get like content of third table?
[04:12:55] <crab> larsemil: no, you can't do that
[04:13:06] <crab> why not just find the third table directly?
[04:13:10] <owzzz> yes
[04:13:29] <larsemil> crab: how do i do that?
[04:13:30] <Cork> larsemil: can be done, but slow; you can't get it through siblings/parent relations?
[04:13:56] <larsemil> Cork: http://www.leanforum.se/konferens2011.asp i would like to get the form.
[04:14:03] <Cork> larsemil: or like the action url from the form
[04:14:14] <seutje> owzzz: throws a type error for me
[04:14:23] <Cork> larsemil: what part do you want?
[04:14:41] <seutje> owzzz: try using an actual element instead of a string
[04:14:51] <larsemil> Cork: preferably the <form> the texts above it i can add manually.
[04:14:58] <seutje> ?eval $.data(document.body, 'foo', 'bar');
[04:15:08] <seutje> bot-t? :(
[04:15:31] <Cork> larsemil: $('form[name="theForm"]') ?
[04:15:53] <larsemil> Cork: sweet.
[04:16:32] <seutje> owzzz: http://jsbin.com/evoce4/edit
[04:16:46] <owzzz> it likes the document.body example you gave
[04:16:46] <larsemil> Cork: but how do i get only that part with load? load(url 'form[name=theForm"]') ??
[04:17:02] <Cork> larsemil: you don't
[04:17:12] <crab> larsemil: you can't, it'll load the whole thing
[04:17:21] <crab> you have to get it and then select the part you want
[04:17:51] <Cork> larsemil: $.get('url', function(data) { <your element>.html($('form[name="theForm"]', data)); });
[04:18:36] <owzzz> i ended up just putting the state on the document.body
[04:18:38] <owzzz> that seemed to work
[04:18:53] <owzzz> the example you gave seutje didnt seem to work :s
[04:18:56] <owzzz> thank you though
[04:19:19] <seutje> owzzz: how did it not work?
[04:19:49] <seutje> owzzz: it logs bar twice for me
[04:20:00] <larsemil> Cork: but if there would have been clear #id on the form for example i could have used load and only gotten the form right
[04:20:19] <Cork> larsemil: no, load loads the complete content
[04:20:36] <duttonstuart> could someone help me get my form thank you page to open up in the same modal box as my form after submitted rather than redirecting to another page?
[04:20:44] <larsemil> Cork: no. i used it before to only load part.
[04:21:03] <duttonstuart> I call the form php using jquery
[04:21:10] <Cork> ?.load @ larsemil
[04:21:19] <Cork> gah...
[04:21:22] <tarzeau> could someone help me put two jquery supersized slideshows into one index.html with hidden/visible divs? at http://sid.ethz.ch/.aiei/ ?
[04:21:32] <Cork> larsemil: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[04:21:40] <larsemil> Cork: i have a working piece of code on daladevelop.se
[04:21:41] <Cork> there is no way to filter it, see for your self
[04:22:17] <topcat> can I wildcard a select like $(#header #edit-submit*)
[04:22:24] <larsemil> Cork: The .load() method, unlike $.get(), allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted.
[04:22:33] <Cork> topcat: no
[04:22:47] <Cork> larsemil: ya i just found it the loading page fragments section
[04:23:07] <Skola> what's the best way nowadays to prevent selection with doubleclicked elements?
[04:23:13] <Cork> larsemil: it will still load the complete content onto memory, so it does the exact same thing as the code i gave you
[04:23:44] <Cork> topcat: if you want to wildcard the ids' you could use a class instead
[04:23:47] <mrud> hi i have a strange problem with jquery 1.5.1 on ios. i have http://paste.pocoo.org/show/408100/ following snipplet and the first time the script gets executed everything works fine, the second time i only see beforeSend in the log nothing else

[04:29:55] <shaggy_> Hmm could someone help me. I'm using jquery UI to attempt to make a little "profile card" that opens up. But i don't want the card coding etc to be saved in the file along with the other stuff. I want to try to embed that or call it from another file. But the issue is I want to try to interact with that dialogbox

[04:34:10] <larsemil> Cork: is this something on their side preventing me?
[04:35:55] <seutje> larsemil: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[04:37:06] <seutje> topcat: u can hijack the rendering of submit buttons and add a form-submit class to the wrapper, if it isn't already there
[04:37:12] <seutje> ah boo, fucker left
[04:37:23] <larsemil> seutje: shouldnt i be able to get a div for example from another page?
[04:37:49] <larsemil> seutje: i mean, i can get it with php easy as that, but would prefer to do it with jquery
[04:40:24] <seutje> larsemil: then be prepared to jump through some flaming hoops
[04:41:43] <stianhj> Anyone have experience with EJS?
[04:42:28] <seutje> larsemil: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/cross-domain-requests-with-jquery/ might provide some insight, it uses yahoo's service for making x-domain requests
[04:43:10] <larsemil> seutje: or i just tell the customer to fix it in some way, :D
[04:45:15] <seutje> larsemil: heh, way to make me waste my time, I'll make sure that never happens again
[04:45:41] <larsemil> seutje: did not mean to

[04:45:48] <VictorCl2> hwo can I go about doing this?
[04:46:21] <seutje> is he gone?
[04:46:32] <larsemil> seutje: thanks alot for your effort and i will save your tip, as i will need it for later. allthough in this case its the same owner of the two domains so i guess that will be easier. Still - i wanted to know if it was doable
[04:47:39] <larsemil> VictorCl2: maybe the split function can help you

[05:05:27] <mazzachre> daffodil: add them in a json object as data
[05:05:40] <fire> Hi. i have used for my page a jquery chat plugin. how can  i check if the other user is typing and then show an icon?
[05:07:11] <daffodil> mazzachre: how do i do that? .change and get value to a variable and how to pass to another page through ajax
[05:07:55] <shaggy_> Is this right? jQuery("#dialog").("a").click(function () {  or how would I do something similar to that?
[05:08:36] <daffodil> mazzachre: can you do it in jsfiddle
[05:09:55] <mazzachre> shaggy_: $.("#dialog a")
[05:10:13] <shaggy_> mazzachre: do you have to have the . there?
[05:11:57] <mazzachre> daffodil: If you want to send all 3 when any of them changes, just add 'change' binding (or better through delegate) and do something like $.ajax{'wherever', {data: {val1: $('selector1').val(), val2...}, success: function() {alert("Weee");}
[05:12:08] <mazzachre> shaggy_: no, error in typing
[05:14:25] <shaggy_> mazzachre: I'm trying to get the jQuery UI dialog box to be able to open other jquery ui dialog boxes. The content of the jquery box is loaded with .load()
[05:14:50] <daffodil> mazzachre: first select the select box then add change method.nxt pass selec value to var. s=using ajaz data pass to another page but this does not work
[05:14:51] <shaggy_> http://paysnork.com/index.php (it'll open up when you load the page), if you'd like to help
[05:14:54] <ChristianAdamski> Hi, jQuery 1.4: problem with IE8, a dynamicly updated <select /> does change the options internally, but still shows the first ones attached. This is really ridicously. First time you append option A -> A is show -> clicking A -> A happens. Then you remove A, add B. A is shown, but clicking B happens?
[05:16:08] <mazzachre> shaggy_: I have no idea if that is even possible...
[05:16:41] <mazzachre> daffodil: ajax is used to pass data to backend... Not between pages...
[05:17:06] <daffodil> mazzachre: yes,i want to do that only.
[05:17:35] <mazzachre> ChristianAdamski: 1.4 is old.. Perhaps it is fixed in newer versions?
[05:17:44] <shaggy_> mazzachre: hmm well basically I just want to try to seperate the jQuery UI dialog content from the page content (like fb does with their dialog boxes). I assume if there was a way to pull the html elements over and insert them INTO the div, it could work but I don't know how to do that
[05:18:16] <mazzachre> daffodil: Then look for inter page communication, that is quite possible also, but different methology and afaik there is nothing in JQuery for it (Though I have not looked that hard tbh)
[05:22:10] <daffodil> mazzachre: in $ajax( url:through this you can send data)
[05:23:51] <mrud> i have a problem with jquery 1.5.2 on ios and .ajax, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/408128/ the first call works but the second does not, i only see the beforesend entry http://shell.spamt.net/~uli/screenshots/2011-06-15-133121_357x381_scrot.png http://shell.spamt.net/~uli/screenshots/2011-06-15-133215_352x350_scrot.png
[05:23:57] <sukima> How do  you handle $(this) scoping in a qunit test?
[05:25:39] <mazzachre> daffodil: ajax is used to send data to backend, not interprocess communication, so it does not apply here
[05:27:34] <topcat> Why on earth does $('#search-block-form').find('input[type~="submit"').val(''); throw Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ="submit" but $dropDown.find('input[type~="text"]'); works fine.
[05:32:12] <jeffsmykil>  Does anyone know of a firefox plugin that will essentially mirror the page you are currently on in IE and do it automatically?
[05:32:36] <Babbage_> hi there, can you help please getting the width of a div? $('#divid').width() throws an object doesnt support property or method 'width' error :(
[05:33:00] <jeffsmykil> you sure it isnt width>
[05:33:02] <jeffsmykil> no ()
[05:33:07] <jeffsmykil> i cant cant remember
[05:33:47] <Babbage_> docs and examples say width()
[05:33:50] <MrMaksimize> Babbage_: no it's width()
[05:33:56] <MrMaksimize> but i remember it not working for me
[05:34:03] <Babbage_> :(
[05:34:06] <jeffsmykil> ok length works the other way
[05:34:26] <MrMaksimize> Babbage_: take a look thru the dom, i think there might be a native js property for it
[05:34:29] <stianhj> Babbage_, is there a div called #divid ? because if it can't find it, it doesn't work
[05:34:46] <Babbage_> yes
[05:35:39] <Babbage_> i dont know if it affects things, but my div doesnt have a specific width set - i.e. its scaling with the window, and I want to know how big it is when my js runs
[05:36:15] <aniessh> Hey All, I need to ask a question, I am implementing jqGrid for my project and I need to leave some fields as uneditable in the inline edit, now when I am adding the navigation bar, only the editable fields are being deleted. The point is that I don't want the fields to be editable but at the same point they should be deleted
[05:37:07] <sukima> Having dome trouble with scoping in qunit. How do you handle testing functions that need a $(this) scope to run? ex: https://gist.github.com/1026988

[05:38:48] <b0ot> I currently get values from snmp via a bash script on my linux box which is my web server. I'm using the jquery ui animated bar to show the value that I got (more as a bar graph). I currently just rewrite the value part in a bash script when the value changes, but the user doesn't notice the change unless they refresh their page. How would I go about getting around this?
[05:39:38] <Babbage_> hmmm
[05:40:21] <j_wright> format it as json in your file and request it on a timer?
[05:40:42] <j_wright> well the former is probably not required

[05:46:51] <shaggy_> How do I use jQuery to get the html of a page?
[05:47:38] <dr0id> ?.html @ shaggy_
[05:47:39] <bot-t> shaggy_, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[05:48:46] <shaggy_> dr0id: don't know if you are a bot or not, but how do I do that for a URL
[05:49:25] <dr0id> shaggy_: fetch the contents via ajax or some server side lang and then do the magik
[05:50:10] <shaggy_> Is it possible to run a php code through jquery? I didn't think it was
[05:53:48] <dr0id> shaggy_: you can do file_Get_contents to get the html of a URL
[05:57:01] <shaggy_> dr0id: yeah I guess that "works" but it causes problems with the ""'s in the html to break the jquery
[06:00:17] <mazzachre> shaggy_: Well in theory, you can use Resig's javascript backend server, and there was a module to run PHP inside that serverside... but I am not sure I see the point :)
[06:00:40] <shaggy_> maybe I'm over complicating it
[06:01:11] <sukima> Can anyone explain scoping?
[06:01:24] <shaggy_> jQuery UI Opens, Loads a "profile card", card has links ---> link clicked: another event happens i.e. new jquery window opens
[06:01:31] <Whirl3d> Good morning all.  What is the preferred way to load javascript external files from within a js? Anyone familiar with $.getScript()?
[06:02:23] <spir> Hi. Any idea how to display all parent items of an hidden item : http://jsbin.com/ojiyo5/2/edit
[06:02:25] <erichynds> Whirl3d: labjs or requirejs are good.
[06:02:44] <spir> I tried this :   $("div.menu li a.current").parent().find("ul").slideToggle("slow"); but it only works on a 2 level ul/li
[06:04:44] <Whirl3d> sukima, scoping can be thought of as "ownership" or "awareness of" basically. If you have a script that uses a variable, the variable has to be defined inside the script using "var local=" or it can be defined in the "global" scope (and no var is used) "global="   If your script doesn't know about the variable declaration, it's not in the same scope
[06:05:38] <daffodil> mazzachre: { type: "POST", url: '/test/a.php',
[06:05:50] <sukima> Whirl3d: Thanks. is this the same as using $(this) inside of jQuery callback functions?
[06:05:56] <Whirl3d> sukima, think of if like an outline...if the bullet point (or variable declaration) isn't in the same heirarchy as the script, it can't access it.
[06:06:33] <Whirl3d> $(this) is a how you refer to the scope of your current script or function
[06:07:11] <Whirl3d> erichynds, thanks for the reply! I'll check those out.
[06:08:44] <shaggy_> Got it! http://yensdesign.com/2008/12/how-to-load-content-via-ajax-in-jquery/
[06:08:55] <shaggy_> Well... Maybe.
[06:09:00] <shaggy_> I don't know yet..
[06:09:15] <mazzachre> daffodil: That will send to the backend at that url with the data you post... if you need someone with that page to see this change, you need the page to poll for changes via ajax also and update on any change...
[06:09:50] <daffodil> mazzachre: say i have a file inside a folder how to set the url
[06:11:33] <shaggy_> nup. Didn't work.... ffs
[06:12:13] <delfick> hi, Chrome keeps randomly stopping in jquery code where there isn't a breakpoint. Executing the code in console gives "Error: SYNTAX_ERR: DOM Exception 12", line 4941 of Jquery 1.6.1. Anyone with any ideas?
[06:12:38] <James-> hey why i get this      xml is not defined with that : http://pastie.org/2072197
[06:13:28] <Jayflux> can some of you run this in firefox
[06:13:29] <Jayflux> http://www.eltafans.com/2/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=8&Itemid=112
[06:13:37] <Whirl3d> delfick, my experience in Chrome has been that it's not jQuery, it's always my code. If it were jQuery, there'd likely be a bug report on it. But it is hard sometimes to find the error in my code because it appears that jQuery is throwing the error.
[06:13:40] <Jayflux> i get an error in firebug attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope
[06:14:12] <delfick> Whirl3d: yeah.. here's a screenshot of it happening https://sites.google.com/site/delfickunistuff/randomError.png
[06:14:53] <sukima> Whirl3d: thanks. still confused when it comes to qunit though.
[06:15:35] <Whirl3d> sukima, sorry, but I have never even looked at qunit, to be honest. Hopefully someone else will provide some insight.

[06:26:17] <dtach> eanima2: no that would just put the text foobar in
[06:26:44] <dtach> eanima2: perhaps something like .html($('#foobar').html))
[06:26:57] <eanima2> my fault yes i wanted insert not replace

[06:27:59] <SPow> Hi. I have an HTML page which contains images that should change when clicked on an execute a server-side script. So, when a button is clicked, part of it is rewritten with jquery, so that it displays itself under another form (for instance a lit lamp that is clicked on becomes dark). Problem it doesn't work after the image has been changed : the link to the CGI script only works when the...
[06:28:01] <SPow> ...page is freshly loaded, i.e. when the jquery has not replaced the code yet.

[06:35:33] <duttonstuart> how do I change this to make it open the php in a new modal box on the same page or even in place of the submitted form?
[06:46:37] <ThiefMaster|work> is there a way to make the jquery ui draggable grid relative to the container instead of to the elements?
[06:47:07] <ThiefMaster|work> i'm just migrating something from prototype to jquery and this page has a checkbox "enable/disable grid" so elements might not be aligned to the grid

[06:57:58] <pifantastic> karstenk1977_: reread what I typed plz
[06:58:00] <Whirl3d>  $('tr').live(function () {$(this).parent(). filter(':nth-child(2n+1)').addClass('odd').next().addClass('even'); });  --- still doesn't look like it's right.
[06:59:13] <karstenk1977_> i want to insert foo in the existing div with id cheesecrust
[06:59:29] <karstenk1977_> but i think the selector is wrong
[06:59:47] <karstenk1977_> and i do not understand enough of JS
[07:00:07] <karstenk1977_> is here someone who can help?
[07:00:55] <mattems> hey all
[07:00:56] <James-> hey why i get this xml is not defined with that : http://pastie.org/2072197
[07:01:34] <Whirl3d> $('tr').children().live(function () {if ($(this).is($(this).parent().find(':nth-child(even)')) {$(this).addClass("even")}});
[07:01:44] <karstenk1977_> ???
[07:02:10] <karstenk1977_> Is here someone who can JS and hast a few minutes?
[07:02:21] <Whirl3d> karstenk1977, I'm afraid you either need to hire a programmer that does JS or take a class or try #javascript.
[07:03:03] <Whirl3d> karstenk1977_, it never takes just a few minutes if you don't already know js. That's a big request, really.
[07:03:03] <karstenk1977_> why to hire a programmer, i ask only for helping to change "one" selector
[07:03:25] <Raverix> Yeah, but you're annoying.
[07:03:57] <jeffsmykil> so im supposed to add another conditional stylesheet to fix the margin-top bug in IE 8?
[07:04:02] <karstenk1977_> is this question to difficult for irc community?
[07:04:20] <James-> why i get this xml is null with that : http://pastie.org/2072197   help me plz
[07:04:28] <Whirl3d> karstenk1977_, no, it's too difficult to deal with someone so insistent that doesn't know what they are doing.
[07:05:05] <James-> Whirl3d can you help me plz
[07:05:19] <Whirl3d> James, looking now... I'm no expert, mind you...
[07:05:56] <James-> i don t understand, php seems to be not load but why ?
[07:06:35] <Whirl3d> James, are you using jQuery?
[07:06:39] <karstenk1977_> if you do not know, then you do not respond well
[07:06:42] <James-> yes
[07:06:57] <Raverix> lol
[07:08:13] <Whirl3d> James, can you identify a line that uses jQuery in your pastebin example. It appears that you are coding a jQuery-like replacement with your getObject function
[07:09:08] <James-> no i can t so what need change ?
[07:09:27] <Raverix> James-: This IRC channel is for helping with jQuery problems.
[07:09:56] <Whirl3d> James, go to jquery.com and check it out. It does everything your code does, only much simpler, with cross-browser compat
[07:10:55] <James-> hum ? can you fix that plz
[07:11:20] * Raverix blinks.
[07:11:41] <Raverix> I miss professionals.
[07:11:45] <PrinceES> <James-> please try to fix it up by yourself
[07:11:50] <Whirl3d> James, jQuery is a framework. You should consider hiring a jQuery programmer or taking a class or learning it. No one will spend the time to do your job for you on this channel. EIther know jQuery or try another forum
[07:11:52] <PrinceES> it would be good for you
[07:12:16] <Whirl3d> James, and it's really easy to learn
[07:12:22] <James-> give me pist
[07:13:21] <RyanD> lol
[07:14:42] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a good way to call a function once a script has loaded (that function being defined in the script being loaded?)
[07:16:03] <Whirl3d> How do I make a string into a function? Like evaluate("doSomething()"); ?
[07:16:23] <Whirl3d> or maybe call("someFunc()");  ?
[07:17:01] <b0ot> I found a nice jquery chart program but I need to figure out how to read a value from a text file on my server
[07:17:21] <b0ot> in what appears to be javascript
[07:17:35] <b0ot> is there an easy way to read the value from a text file on my server using javascript?
[07:17:42] <Whirl3d> bOot, check out $.ajax
[07:18:10] <Whirl3d> or $.getJson
[07:18:54] <mazzachre> So, anyone who can help me with http://jsfiddle.net/2YfYF/ ? When no arguments are present, it will return an object where "" is set to "undefined" I am looking for an empty object if no arguments are present...
[07:19:22] <Raverix> Whirl3d: That depends on where the function is.
[07:19:41] <Raverix> If it's inside of an object, you can do obj["function_name"](args);
[07:19:49] <Whirl3d> var obj=arguments.length>0?arguments:{}
[07:19:59] <Raverix> Whirl3d: If it's global, you can use window["function_name"](args);
[07:21:03] <Whirl3d> Raverix, great, thanks. One more quick question...
[07:21:35] <Whirl3d> If I have a $(document).ready() call inside a script that I am loading after dom is loaded, with the function still fire?
[07:21:45] <b0ot> can you put jquery inside javascript
[07:22:00] * voronika is elsewhere - Automagically set away at Wed Jun 15 07:22:00 2011 -
[07:22:02] <Whirl3d> wow
[07:22:05] <kojiro> voronika: ugh
[07:22:06] <seutje> mazzachre: if (!qs) { return {}; } ?
[07:22:12] <kojiro> b0ot: jquery *is* javascript
[07:22:17] <Raverix> Whirl3d: Yeah, check out the docs, it says as much.
[07:22:21] <mazzachre> Hmm.. that was an idea
[07:23:05] <Whirl3d> Raverix, thanks. I've been reading and reading and can't quite get a final answer. There's lots of conflicting info out there. I'll dig some more. Thanks for your help
[07:23:08] <b0ot> kojiro, alright... simple question. right now I found some javascript code that gets a value from just Math.random(), I would like to instead for that variable to get a value from a text file which will contain a number... how might I accomplish this
[07:23:17] <b0ot> kojiro, the file is on the server side
[07:23:37] <Raverix> Whirl3d: Here's the proof...
[07:23:51] <drpeps> hello, i'm having issues with jquery slideDown's method
[07:23:54] <Raverix> Paste this into the console: $(document).ready(alert('test'))
[07:24:01] <Raverix> After the page has already loaded :)
[07:24:02] <kojiro> b0ot: $.ajax
[07:24:03] <drpeps> specifically, i'm doing: $j('#pastEventsList').height("auto").slideDown("slow", function() {});
[07:24:15] <drpeps> this does expand the div, but it doesnt animate anything
[07:24:21] <drpeps> it just pops it to the new size
[07:24:55] <Whirl3d> Raverix, duh! not sure why I was having such a hard time getting a straight answer to that...thanks as always for your help.
[07:24:59] <drpeps> since i'm not using an easing function i don't think i need the easing plugin
[07:25:03] <Raverix> the .height("auto") will make the height auto, that would make it full size.
[07:25:13] <drpeps> yeah, thats what i want
[07:25:15] <Raverix> What if you just have $j('#pastEventsList').slideDown("slow", function() {});
[07:25:27] <drpeps> let me try that
[07:25:56] <drpeps> that doesnt expand the div any more
[07:25:58] <drpeps> does nothing.
[07:26:19] <Raverix> drpeps: Is the site online somewhere?
[07:26:23] <drpeps> i have the same issue with .animate
[07:26:25] <drpeps> yeah
[07:26:32] <b0ot> kojiro, setInterval(function() {var x = (new Date()).getTime(), y = Math.random(); series.addPoint([x, y], true, true);}, 1000); I would need to use ajax to get the value for y from a file?
[07:26:58] <mazzachre> Hmmm.. yes, that worked... Now, how do I test if an object literal is empty? :D
[07:27:01] <drpeps> http://dev.associazionemariangelapinna.it/attivita/informazione/  >> the trigger is the "Mostra tutti gli eventi passati" text down near the footer
[07:27:23] <crankharder> I have aa textarea with a bunch of markup in it.  when I do $('textarea').val() I get a string of markup back -- can I convert that into something I can query against and modify?
[07:27:40] <dtach> Hi there, when i load my external page it return the following text, i'm wondering if i can somehow wrap the timestamps with div's using jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/PmkuK/1/
[07:28:04] <drpeps> Raverix: i've tried with pixel sizes as well [as it is now i believe] but same result
[07:28:34] <drpeps> Raverix: in the source the js lines are around line 118
[07:28:46] <kojiro> b0ot: if the file is on the server, then you must request it from the server. ajax is probably the best way to do that
[07:31:58] <drpeps> Raverix: any insights? can you reproduce the issue?
[07:34:13] <crankharder> I have an anchor/href as a string:  '<a href="foo/abr">blah</a>' -- how do I match just the href?
[07:35:02] <crankharder> er, nvm
[07:35:04] <Raverix> drpeps: The problem seems to be that you can't animate from a fixed width to 'auto'
[07:35:14] <kojiro> crankharder: "*[href='foo/abr']"
[07:35:16] <Raverix> What you need to do, is figure out the height in auto.
[07:35:20] <Raverix> And then animate to it.
[07:35:31] <Raverix> google jquery animate to auto height
[07:35:40] <Raverix> There are several workarounds to this issue.,
[07:35:56] <walkingeyerobot> dtach: http://jsfiddle.net/walkingeyerobot/j97T7/
[07:36:00] <Pupeno_> When I return from an ajax call I get an error, the error is SyntaxError: invalid label, which I remember was jquery trying to execute the reply or something like. Does anybody know what's going on?
[07:36:27] <drpeps> Raverix: so.. wait. you're saying that this: $j('#pastEventsList').height("600px").slideDown('slow', function() {}); should work, right?
[07:36:39] <Raverix> No.
[07:36:48] <b0ot> Could someone explain to me how i might modfiy this: http://pastebin.com/R8r8dwKK to simply get the contents of the ajax_info.txt file into a javascript variable?
[07:37:01] <drpeps> but that's no longer to an "auto" height
[07:37:05] <drpeps> so what's the issue again?
[07:37:13] <drpeps> the initial height
[07:37:15] <drpeps> or the final height?
[07:37:18] <dtach> walkingeyerobot: awesome, thank you so much!
[07:38:04] <Raverix> drpeps: Run this on your site: $j('#pastEventsList').slideUp("slow");$j('#pastEventsList').slideDown("slow");
[07:38:26] <Raverix> You'll slide up and and down to that height.
[07:38:34] <Raverix> This is how slide up / slide down works.
[07:38:50] <Raverix> In your situation, you're trying to slide to 'auto' - and unfortunately, that's not possible.
[07:39:30] <Raverix> So, you could do something like store the height of the div on page load, then dynamically restrict it to 380 px, and then animate to the height you stored.
[07:39:34] <Raverix> Like I said:
[07:39:38] <Raverix> google jquery animate to auto height
[07:39:44] <Raverix> There are several work around
[07:39:46] <drpeps> i'll do that
[07:39:51] <drpeps> thanks for your valuable input.
[07:48:49] <drpeps> Raverix: all i find that seems reasonable is this: http://markmail.org/message/crrvq6tdbv4f5eh3#query:+page:1+mid:m5g4ynxlh7yseptr+state:results
[07:49:01] <drpeps> unfortunatley, the onComplete event never seems to fire.
[07:49:58] <Raverix> http://www.google.com/search?&q=jquery+animate+to+auto+height
[07:50:17] <Raverix> Read the first three links.
[07:50:50] <crankharder> is jslint.com dead... it's giving me a few hundred errors and jsfiddle gives me 0
[07:50:54] <crankharder> ?
[07:51:57] <kurol> no, that sounds right to me
[07:53:29] <kurol> try jshint instead of jslint
[07:58:23] <b0ot> Can someone explain to me how I might be able to modify the y variable to read it from a file: http://www.highcharts.com/demo/dynamic-update click on "View Options" to see the code
[07:58:38] <drpeps> crankharder: jslint just cranked up the setting. i think crockford switched meds and got furious.
[07:59:08] <drpeps> makes it a pain to use.
[08:04:43] <drpeps> Raverix: most of those solutions are so absurdly bloated it's just amazing.
[08:04:47] <hmbg> is there any way to determine which part of a string is actually visible in the viewport?
[08:05:00] <drpeps> http://pastie.org/2072660 did it.
[08:05:35] <hmbg> like if I want to make an e-book app and split a big block of text on pages
[08:06:11] <drpeps> not sure if i really need the .show()
[08:09:12] <shesek> hmbg, you could see what elements are visible using something like var containerHeight =  $('#container').height(); var visibleChilds = []; var currentHeight = 0; $('#container').contents().each(function(){currentHeight += $(this).height(); if (currentHeight <= containerHeight){ visibleChilds.push(this); } else {return false;}});
[08:10:13] <shesek> but its very problematic, you'll have to re-calcuate it on every resize
[08:10:37] <hmbg> shesek: yes, and it also only works on discrete elements
[08:10:48] <hmbg> can't do it with just text
[08:11:09] <Trisox> evening can someone look at my code an see wy my json is not returning ? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/6/
[08:11:14] <shesek> and it won't be able to display a single long element over multiple pages and such
[08:11:52] <hmbg> shesek: precisely
[08:13:03] <Trisox> any one
[08:13:36] <shesek> Trisox, define 'not returning' ?
[08:13:46] <ndee> what tooltip plugin can you guys recommend?
[08:15:03] <PrinceES> <Trisox> you just defined ids
[08:15:28] <PrinceES> not other input values
[08:15:32] <Trisox> console.log(data.post_response[0]); =  undefined
[08:15:42] <PrinceES> let me check
[08:16:12] <Trisox> k
[08:16:29] <Trisox> i wanna check if id json = id input and fill in the data
[08:16:50] <spir> Q: Any idea how to display all parent items of an hidden one? http://jsbin.com/ojiyo5/2/edit
[08:17:13] <spir> $("div.menu li a.current").parent().find("ul").slideToggle("slow"); → only works with 1 level
[08:17:31] <shesek> Trisox, Have you checked what Firebug is saying about that request ?
[08:17:56] <Trisox> yup post_response is returned in data
[08:18:02] <zach23> how do I append an option to a select menu? http://jsfiddle.net/VdSYD/ - works in FF and Chrome; not IE...This is jquery 1.4.2
[08:20:21] <shesek> spir, not sure about your question, but $('div.menu li:has(a.current) ul').slideToggle(...) is a nicer way of doing that
[08:20:34] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/8/
[08:20:37] <Trisox> check the log
[08:21:04] <ryanneufeld> someone mentioned me last night, but my logs don't go back that far
[08:21:23] <ryanneufeld> any way of seeing that?

[08:29:27] <nail_> (and you need to check against -1 with indexOf)
[08:30:08] <cos_> ah that was my mistake

[08:34:04] <ch3mical> Morning, hackers
[08:34:07] <DarsVaeda1> hmm the html is called in a jquery ui dialog maybe that interferes somehow
[08:34:32] <shesek> glad I could help
[08:34:55] <ch3mical> DarsVaeda1: what are you trying to do?
[08:35:11] <DarsVaeda1> things
[08:38:03] <drubies> you know something is up when .parent('body') returns nothing ;/
[08:38:23] <markj> you know something is up when parents('body') returns nothing
[08:38:35] <markj> considering parent() returning nothing could just mean its not a direct child of parent
[08:38:38] <ajpiano> you know that the something is the fact that parent only returns the immediate parent
[08:38:42] <markj> of body
[08:38:44] <DarsVaeda1> petersendidit: error was easy, i called the selector before the dialog opening
[08:39:00] <nickelnick> is there another way to have a page load as a dialog in JQUERY MOBILE?

[08:39:26] <drubies> markj ajpiano -- thank you ;p i thought it just went right up the DOM
[08:39:54] <ajpiano> coachz, serialize only serializes fields that have a name attr
[08:40:07] <coachz> thanks !  so simple, you rock ajpiano
[08:40:43] <nickelnick> AJ how are you dude
[08:40:51] <ajpiano> i am aight

[08:43:39] <nickelnick> haaha
[08:44:11] <nickelnick> hey dude are you working much with the mobile lately?
[08:44:22] <nickelnick> jquerymobile
[08:45:06] <ajpiano> haven't in a few months
[08:46:33] <nickelnick> is there a way to make a dialog without <a data-role="dialog">
[08:46:52] <nickelnick> like, ajax form loads...at error it says, you forgot to fill in...
[08:47:17] <nickelnick> so its not technically loading from the a link, its using ajax to load
[08:47:29] <ajpiano> i'm not sure
[08:47:34] <nickelnick> so it loads as a regular page
[08:47:46] <nickelnick> I thought there was a way to make a page as dialog..no matter how it loads
[08:48:09] <Fernandos> hiya ajpiano :)
[08:48:13] <ajpiano> hi Fernandos
[08:48:32] <Fernandos> ajpiano: how's it going? :)
[08:49:07] <nickelnick> another one i've been stuck on the past week on and off is the datepicker
[08:49:18] <ajpiano> Fernandos, aight.  bout to have some meetin's
[08:51:42] <nickelnick> I can get the datepicker JqueryUI one to work on mobile site, but is offcenter. however it does fade away after clicking a date. where as the jquery mobile requires additional datepicker mobile library for the date, and does not have any calendar that shows (rather a spinner where u can scroll up and down on the mouse and the date will change. but no calendar sticks. the mobile datepicker css seems to be loading for it 
[08:52:30] <nickelnick> any idea what im doing wrong? it works on the jq demo just fine (as much as i dont like the way the calendar stays on page after selecting.
[08:52:39] <Fernandos> ajpiano: Interesting, hope there is less talk more fun :)
[08:53:02] <VictorCL> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6360584/have-jquery-filter-inside-live-event
[08:53:36] <nickelnick> oohh dude! I'm so stoked too, I just bought Pro Tools 9 last night on ultra sale at hellomusic
[08:53:40] <nickelnick> only 450
[08:53:59] <nickelnick> i cant wait to geek out on that shit so bad
[08:54:11] <ajpiano> VictorCL, you should use delegate instead of live - live can't support any filtering methods
[08:54:19] <ajpiano> "DOM traversal methods are not supported for finding elements to send to .live(). Rather, the .live() method should always be called directly after a selector, as in the example above.
[08:54:19] <ajpiano> "
[08:54:37] <dragthor> hey guys, first time in here... checking it out
[08:54:42] <ajpiano> nickelnick, nice
[08:55:04] <nickelnick> you guys still playing out?
[08:55:15] <ajpiano> yah, 3 shows comin up
[08:55:21] <nickelnick> nice dude!
[08:55:46] <dragthor> exit
[08:56:19] <ajpiano> VictorCL, you can't use llive for things that aren't in fact events
[08:56:21] <Fernandos> nickelnick: is  Pro Tools 9 any better than cubase? I'm used to use cubase..
[08:56:24] <ajpiano> you have to do livequery for what you're trying to do
[08:57:04] <roger_padactor> to get all the selects of a specific class you do  $('.class_name') correct? if so no idea whyh its returning nothing.
[08:57:04] <Fernandos> nickelnick: checkout eastwest for samples.. they're hot
[08:57:44] <roger_padactor> never mind
[08:58:13] <emperorcezar> Can someone tell me how jquery knows if I'm calling the event .load or if I'm trying to .load into a element using ajax?
[08:58:37] <ajpiano> emperorcezar, method overloading
[08:58:52] <ajpiano> it determines based on how many arguments you pass and what type they are
[08:59:30] <emperorcezar> ajpiano: I tried doing $(document).load(function(){console.log('called'))}); and it never called.
[08:59:44] <ajpiano> cause load is on the window not the document
[08:59:47] <emperorcezar> That's how I noticed there are two of them.
[08:59:49] <emperorcezar> Ah, ok

[09:09:38] <nickelnick> is there a way to change the input format to another delimiter for data-type="date"

[09:10:18] <dannymac21> how can i ensure a div is always hidden if validator.numberOfInvalids() = 0 ?
[09:10:28] <nickelnick> other than going back thru manually and reformatting
[09:10:46] <Fernandos> nickelnick: new Date().format("dd-mmm-yy"); ?
[09:10:50] <dannymac21> i see no way to use a success callback using validate plugin
[09:11:05] <dannymac21> only if form is invalid
[09:11:29] <nickelnick> Fernandos: for a <input> on the fly?
[09:11:30] <dannymac21> anyone have a idea on my question above?
[09:11:58] <nickelnick> okay i get you
[09:12:08] <sendoushi> hi people, here is something...$('#entrada').css({'opacity': 0}).delay(300).animate({opacity: 1}, 500).delay(4000).animate({opacity: 0}, 500);
[09:12:08] <sendoushi> 		$('#home').css({'opacity': 0}).delay(5500).animate({opacity: 1}, 500); how can i join these two lines?
[09:12:16] <nickelnick> but i mean, is there not a way to set the default for html5 data-type="date"
[09:12:23] <sendoushi> like, instead of the delays say something like "when this is over do this"
[09:16:00] <dannymac21> anybody use Validation plugin a lot?  need help on small problem.
[09:16:03] <dannymac21> please.
[09:18:25] <seutje> best issue even: "When I doubleclick on some parts of the page, half the page turns blue"
[09:18:31] <seutje> any1? :D
[09:18:38] <seutje> s/even/ever
[09:18:39] <Fernandos> nickelnick: I think there are standards for the date attribute, you can check them out on the w3c site.. lemme
[09:19:05] <Fernandos> nickelnick: yeah this is the link.. http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#dates-and-times
[09:21:30] <josh_> Grr.  Stupid connection.  Hope this didn't already send once.  In jQuery.getJSON or .ajax requests, is there anyway to set what the cachebusting param is?  ie:  Instead of having it be &_1231243123124134, set it to be &foo=_1231312312315
[09:21:41] <Spockz|web> How can I prevent a click event on a sortable handle to fire in case it was dragged?
[09:21:59] <Fernandos> nickelnick: maybe it's me but I think it makes more sense to save json in the localstorage than storing crap in the markup
[09:22:18] <ajpiano> josh_: you can probably do it with an ajax prefilter, http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[09:23:16] <josh_> ajpiano: Ah, you mean just add my own cachebusting there?
[09:23:19] <dannymac21> i'm trying to hide a errors div at the top of the page once form passed validation using validation plugin.  i only see callback for invalidHandler and submitHandler
[09:23:52] <ajpiano> josh_, essentailly, yeah - you could just set foo = to the _ param in the data, and then delete the _ prop
[09:24:20] <nickelnick> fernandos: thanks ill check it out
[09:24:53] <josh_> ajpiano: Hmm... So scan through the params, find the one that starts with an underscore, grab it as the value for foo, and then delete it?  Interesting
[09:25:03] <josh_> thanks
[09:25:05] <ajpiano> not even "scan" though
[09:25:06] <ajpiano> just like
[09:25:48] <ajpiano> options.data.foo = options.data._; delete options.data._
[09:25:50] <ajpiano> something along those lines
[09:26:12] <josh_> but the param isn't _
[09:26:34] <josh_> ajpiano: the cachebusting param is _123long243random52number
[09:26:50] <ajpiano> ohhh
[09:26:52] <ajpiano> true dat
[09:27:06] <VictorCL> there is so huge difference in speed on jquery compare with firefox ...
[09:27:20] <seutje> don't u need 2 things for a comparison?
[09:27:24] <systemfault> Haha
[09:27:56] <seutje> might as well say "oranges are so much sweeter"
[09:31:17] <Fernandos> dannymac21: which validation plugin?
[09:31:55] <RobW> anyone know what kind of transition these guys are using: http://www.ibm.com/us/en/ -- click on the square boxes in the header on the right (under the circle bubbles)
[09:32:29] <dannymac21> jquery validate 1.8.js
[09:33:00] <Fernandos> RobW: easing
[09:33:09] <Fernandos> I think exp()
[09:33:12] <RobW> ?
[09:33:19] <RobW> yes but do you know of a plugin for jq?
[09:33:31] <Fernandos> RobW: http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/
[09:33:40] <dannymac21> the keyup event is removing the bulleted error messages, but when there are no errors left, the parent div isn't getting hidden.
[09:34:41] <Fernandos> dannymac21: you can use jsfiddle.com to put a minimal example online
[09:35:02] <dannymac21> ok, will try to do it.
[09:35:24] <shmu> i am puzzled by a certain behavior of jquery. when doing $("script") i get all the script tags of the page, but when doing $($("html").html()).find("script") there is nothing returned. the funny thing is that doing $($("html").html()).find("img") will return an array of the image... can any one figure this behavior ?

[09:37:01] <jamesarosen> I'm trying to test namespaced events. Anyone have any pointers? I've bound on 'click.foo', but neither .click() nor .trigger('click.foo') triggers the handler

[09:40:11] <jquerier> Hello world
[09:48:05] <goodknight> jamesarosen: have you tried live() ?
[09:48:33] <jamesarosen> goodknight: any reason why? The elements on the page aren't changing
[09:48:53] <goodknight> jamesarosen: would need more detail then - can you provide an example page or jsfiddle?

[09:52:30] <dutton> I am calling the form to open with the modal box which is opening ok.. but then if any validation errors occur then it opens in a new html to tell you about it..
[09:55:03] <jamesarosen> goodknight: http://stackoverflow.com/q/6361356/1190

[10:10:20] <dutton> the site says use in an iframe which I did and  it worked fine but not ideal.. so took it out of the iframe and loaded with jquery
[10:10:50] <dutton> loads ok but the close button is missing and also it doesnt behave properly
[10:11:13] <dutton> it opens a fresh window to tell me when it hasnt validated properly..

[10:35:36] <Ownatik> Hi, I have a tag with text inside, but this text also contains <br/> tags. I'd like to select all this text, and put every line into an array. How could I do this?
[10:36:16] <Fernandos> I tried map() and each() with .toArray() and .get()  but I wether retrieve only the clicked item or an object.. I want to retrieve all items in an array http://jsfiddle.net/7dXaE/14/
[10:36:28] <ekkis> Ownatik: .html()
[10:36:39] <ekkis> you could then split it on the breaks
[10:36:51] <Ownatik> ok it's the split  Iwonder how to
[10:37:05] <ekkis> "string".split(bywhat)
[10:37:55] <ekkis> Fernandos: I'm not sure I follow
[10:38:05] <ekkis> what is it you want to accomplish?
[10:39:09] <ekkis> Fernandos: the if() is unnecessary since this event will only fire for list items
[10:39:27] <RobW> hm weird
[10:39:45] <Fernandos> ekkis: I want to get all ids (the digits only) and send those through ajax to a reorder.php to reorder elements.. but this is a minimal example, so I would be glad if only an array of digits would return.. but I only get a comma seperated list..
[10:39:49] <Fernandos> at msot
[10:39:53] <Fernandos> *most
[10:40:00] <ekkis> Fernandos: you also don't need to specify $('ul li') because list items only should live inside of the ul, so $('li') is sufficient
[10:40:54] <ekkis> Fernandos: but the user will only click on one list item at a time, so it's not an array
[10:40:54] <Fernandos> offtopic: yep but I remember that beeing specific in jq selectors is better for the traversal speed
[10:41:27] <ekkis> Fernandos: so: alert($(this).attr('id'))
[10:45:21] <Aple> Hey, can anyone tell my why this plugin (Cycle) isn't loading? http://socialbarterfly.com/
[10:45:47] <ekkis> Aple: look at your console for clues
[10:46:39] <Aple> It says "$("#slider").cycle is not a function" but... why?
[10:47:15] <bot-t1> Aple, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8
[10:47:29] <blindMoe> Aple: because you are loading jQuery twice
[10:47:39] <Fernandos> ekkis: k got it I think.. not sure yet http://jsfiddle.net/7dXaE/15/
[10:47:45] <blindMoe> you are loading jquery, then cycle, then jquery again which wipes out cycle
[10:48:44] <Aple> blindMoe: Awesome! Thanks!
[10:48:54] <Aple> I was like "Wtf! I've used this plugin a billion times!"
[10:51:02] <ekkis> Aple: so you either didn't include the plugin or the plugin doesn't work
[10:51:40] <ekkis> Fernandos: ok, but why are you insisting on an array?  the user can only click on one item at a time
[10:51:45] <blindMoe> ekkis: it was because jquery was being included before _and_ after the plugin
[10:51:54] <ekkis> ah
[10:52:46] <ekkis> Fernandos: $('ul').click(function() { alert($(this).attr('id'); });
[10:52:49] <ekkis> that's it
[10:53:26] <Fernandos> ekkis: I know :) but I was trying to get all ids into an array to resort them in the db.. I tihnk this is fixing it http://jsfiddle.net/7dXaE/17/
[10:54:14] <ekkis> if you want all the ids, not the one the user clicked on, why are you doing this in the click event?
[10:54:36] <devinrolsen> good day all.
[10:54:49] <Fernandos> ciao devinrolsen
[10:56:08] <Fernandos> oh hai devinrolsen :P (english is not my motherlanguage)
[10:56:40] <devinrolsen> :) hello Fernandos.
[10:56:43] <devinrolsen> trying select a select box's proper option, not by an index but rather if the option contains a particular value "option:contains('+valued+')". However, if one option contains 1 and another contains 100, it always assumes 100 is what I am looking for.
[10:57:06] <devinrolsen> anyone know something like contains that is more precise?
[10:57:07] <d4rklit3> hi
[10:57:17] <d4rklit3> has anyone any experience with cufon rollover states?
[10:58:11] <Aple> ekkis: No. I loaded jQuery twice which screwed it up. I included the plugin, AND the plugin didn't have any bugs (worked).
[10:58:18] <Aple> Thanks again blindMoe.
[10:59:16] <ravenzz> devinrolsen with value you mean the text within the <option> tag?
[10:59:25] <devinrolsen> correct
[10:59:26] <devinrolsen> the text
[11:00:19] <ravenzz> could you provide us a live example? or, better, a code snippet
[11:00:30] <ravenzz> you can paste it on jsfiddle.net
[11:00:32] <devinrolsen> give me a sec sure.
[11:03:28] <Destroyer661> Hi there, I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to call an indeterminate amount of functions as deferred objects
[11:04:10] <Destroyer661> ie: running over an array of objects with $.each() and calling a deferred object for each element, then aggregating them into one somehow
[11:04:58] <skamikaze> Destroyer661: you could try $.when.apply( $, [ array of functions ]
[11:05:35] <Destroyer661> hmm
[11:05:37] <Destroyer661> i'll give it a go
[11:06:16] <Destroyer661> thanks
[11:06:16] <devinrolsen> ravenzz http://jsfiddle.net/gvVhq/1/
[11:06:55] <devinrolsen> this script is to hash history form elements, so if you notice, when you change the select box option.. it jumps to the wrong number.
[11:07:14] <devinrolsen> cause its using contains.. and well both 1 or 100 contains the same value (if you will)
[11:07:54] <ravenzz> devinrolsen while you was pasting the code..i made this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/xj3Q6/
[11:08:04] <devinrolsen> near the bottom of the JS where it says //select, this is where my issue is
[11:08:06] <ravenzz> i'll take at yours wait
[11:08:17] <ravenzz> i'll take a look at yours wait
[11:10:11] <devinrolsen> well, hum in jsfiddle.net its not behaving exactly as it should.. but you can see sometimes it thinks you mean 100 or 250, when infact you choose 1 or 25.
[11:10:30] <ravenzz> devinrolsen maybe you are missing the quotes for contains()
[11:10:55] <ravenzz> contains("'+valued+'")
[11:11:14] <devinrolsen> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:11:17] <devinrolsen> wront contains.
[11:11:25] <devinrolsen> we are talking about the :contains() selector
[11:11:30] <eyebrow> Please, if this isnt the right way to do a cross domain get, what is? function fn(d) { alert(d); }; $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: 'http://jquery.com', dataType: 'jsonp', jsonp: 'fn' })
[11:11:33] <ravenzz> yes
[11:12:20] <devinrolsen> worth a try I guess.. let me see.
[11:12:39] <xxiao> so, static/global variables are better done via cookie plugin, right?
[11:12:49] <xxiao> i want some state to persist after i close the tab
[11:12:58] <xxiao> and re-open it, guess cookie is the only way to do that
[11:13:15] <ravenzz> php sessions?
[11:13:21] <xxiao> ajax
[11:13:23] <devinrolsen> no go, still is picking up the last option if can find that contains()
[11:13:33] <devinrolsen> vs. the correct one I am selecting.
[11:13:38] <ravenzz> uhm
[11:14:19] <xxiao> ravenzz: does that make sense? i use ajax to call a binary cgi on the server
[11:14:21] <ravenzz> have you take a look at my fiddle?
[11:14:39] <devinrolsen> YES
[11:14:41] <devinrolsen> opps
[11:14:43] <devinrolsen> yes.
[11:15:05] <devinrolsen> but you are basicly doing the same as me. $(this).val() is the same as what I parse from the hash url.
[11:15:22] <devinrolsen> but you are just alerting, not trying to set the select like I am.
[11:15:36] <ravenzz> xxiao usually you can store data into a SESSION, that's gonna to expire
[11:16:20] <ravenzz> if you are looking a kind of way to permanent store datas, you should go for cookies
[11:16:48] <ravenzz> but they can fail, if the browser reject or don't allow them
[11:17:26] <ravenzz> ok devinrolsen
[11:17:28] <ekkis> Fernandos: it's simpler: http://jsfiddle.net/MyeaE/
[11:17:37] <ravenzz> maybe i did go to that issue time ago,
[11:17:41] <monk12> i saw a plugin that takes a <select> tag and hides it  (display:none) and styles a new widget which communicates with the original select tag... I was curiuos if the user submits the form,  doesn' t the non-displayed select tag not POST its values?
[11:18:16] <ravenzz> tou can do something like $('select').val(yourSelectedOptionValue);
[11:18:54] <ravenzz> you, even
[11:19:16] <Fernandos> hmm
[11:22:04] <devinrolsen> ahh, ok found something that fixed it, http://wowmotty.blogspot.com/2010/05/jquery-selectors-adding-contains-exact.html
[11:22:15] <devinrolsen> someone has extended contains to be an exact match.
[11:22:24] <devinrolsen> and it's working perfect now.
[11:23:02] <ravenzz> great
[11:24:48] <monk12> ravenzz, were you typing to me that $('select').val ... comment?
[11:25:06] <ravenzz> no monk12
[11:25:14] <monk12> oh gotcha. my bad.
[11:25:19] <ravenzz> did you ask somethink
[11:25:23] <ravenzz> related on selects?
[11:25:45] <monk12> soemthing about selects above it, dont sweat it. its more a general question than jquery
[11:26:12] <ravenzz> oh i miss your question
[11:26:18] <ravenzz> you should reask
[11:27:32] <Fernandos> ekkis: then I get something like this http://jsfiddle.net/7dXaE/20/ this is nice, but how would I convert that into a php array?
[11:27:34] <xxiao> ravenzz: what do you mean storing it to a session? i need to check a status variable even after the browser is closed and re-opened
[11:27:46] <xxiao> ravenzz: it has to be 'static'
[11:27:57] <skamikaze> Fernandos: #php :)
[11:28:11] <devinrolsen> Yay! 4 hours later this thing is completed ha. Its one thing to use an hashHistory plugin for links and such, but for form elements (input[radio][text][checkbox],select), what a pain the butt to have to custom build such a thing.
[11:28:24] <xxiao> it's a hardware thing, i dont want to reboot it many times just because my browser closed and all variables in my jquery is reset
[11:28:24] <ravenzz> xxiao oh ok so go for cookies
[11:28:55] <xxiao> ravenzz: i don't know those session, what do you mean by 'storing it to SESSION', would like to know more of it
[11:29:09] <ekkis> Fernandos: you'll make an ajax call.  the $.ajax() has a data: element which you can set to an array
[11:29:16] <ekkis> it should land in php just like an array
[11:29:30] <Fernandos> ah
[11:29:41] <ekkis> I still don't understand why you want to do this inside of a click event
[11:29:52] <ekkis> but, yes, it's cleaner now
[11:30:24] <ekkis> you can also encode the item as the numeric value only: <li id="1">
[11:30:34] <ekkis> so you don't have to parse it at runtime

[11:41:18] <ccmonster> dhey guys
[11:42:10] <ccmonster> I am using the jqueryui buttons, and I wanted to know how I avoid the button (pre-js) showing up on the page, because then I watch it converted by jquery
[11:42:16] <ccmonster> im trying to avoid seeing all that go down.
[11:48:53] <shmu> i am puzzled by a certain behavior of jquery. when doing $("script") i get all the script tags of the page, but when doing $($("html").html()).find("script") there is nothing returned. the funny thing is that doing $($("html").html()).find("img") will return an array of the image... can any one figure this behavior ? (thanks)
[11:50:33] <ekkis> I can't get figure out how plugins should behave: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6362000/getting-plugin-to-work-for-multiple-items
[11:50:41] <wbednarski> @shmu its probably because you have script inside head
[11:51:05] <shmu> but <head> is inside <html>
[11:51:20] <shmu> wbednarski: + there are for sure some in the body..
[11:51:23] <ekkis> wbednarski: I was going to suggest that but he's right
[11:51:35] <wbednarski> hmm
[11:51:45] <mattyh88> hey, does somebody know a good way to find your position (lat long) with your mobile device
[11:51:52] <ekkis> shmu: .html() returns a string does it not?
[11:52:13] <ekkis> so I'm wondering how .find() would find anything
[11:53:11] <shmu> ekkis: but then i take the string and $() it
[11:53:19] <shmu> so it becomes jquerified
[11:53:33] <Whirl3d> jquery will turn html text into an unattached element so $(html).find() will work
[11:53:36] <ekkis> oh, I see
[11:53:42] <Whirl3d> shmu++ same thing
[11:53:50] <ekkis> yeah
[11:54:04] <shmu> so the weird thing
[11:54:14] <shmu> it will find 'img' 'div' 'span'
[11:54:27] <shmu> but not 'script'
[11:54:28] <ekkis> scripts are always a little problematic
[11:54:41] <shmu> ekkis: if i will do this $("script") it will work!
[11:54:45] <Whirl3d> sure it will as long as you don't attach it to the dom
[11:55:25] <ekkis> shmu: there might be a bit of magic behind the scenes on that.  i don't know
[11:55:28] <Whirl3d> for some reason, in ajax, when you attach text with <script> in it, it gets incorporated into the document, but somehow doesn't show up
[11:56:00] <shmu> not fun :(
[11:56:01] <ekkis> shmu: have you written jquery plugins before?  I'm struggling with something: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6362000/getting-plugin-to-work-for-multiple-items
[11:56:17] <shmu> ekkis: never
[11:56:25] <ekkis> ok...
[11:56:28] <Whirl3d> shmu, but you can use the data before it gets attached to search for <script>s
[11:56:29] <ekkis> thanks anyway
[11:56:32] <sudaya> hi all, how can i convert json to array ??
[11:56:47] <shmu> Whirl3d: how ?
[11:56:50] <ekkis> sudaya: why?
[11:56:52] <shmu> regexp ?
[11:57:21] <sudaya> ekkis in jqchart only array is acceptable
[11:57:22] <Whirl3d> $.ajax (url, {dataType:"html", success:function (data) {
[11:57:28] <Whirl3d> sorry, wrong window. lOL
[11:58:09] <ekkis> sudaya: var o = {}; var myarr = [o];
[11:58:55] <sudaya> ekkis: will it works ??
[11:59:16] <Whirl3d> shmu, when you get the data back in your ajax function, it's text and can be searched as text. By $(data).find("script") it should find scripts before the html is attached to the dom
[11:59:59] <ekkis> sudaya: myarr will be an array
[12:00:19] <ekkis> sudaya: I don't know jqchart or what it needs
[12:00:20] <shmu> Whirl3d:  so how do i search the text ? regexp ? hoped jquery will do it better then me writing up regexp to go over the text.
[12:01:20] <Whirl3d> shmu, gimme a second and I'll make a quick fiddle to show you
[12:03:44] <shmu> 10x
[12:06:05] <juha____> anyone done any plugins and published to github? i just did 10 line long plugin and i'm wondering that if it's too short to publish :P
[12:06:08] <cakehero> I can't get the tabs() function to work - is there a way I can check and make sure UI Core and UI Widget are loaded?
[12:06:15] <cakehero> juha____ it is not!
[12:07:10] <necromancer> does anyone here use qunit (i guess besides the jquery devs) to test their javascript?
[12:07:32] <ryrych> good evening/good morning :D
[12:07:51] <humbug> afternoon
[12:08:05] <cakehero> morning
[12:08:06] <ryrych> and afternoon :)
[12:08:15] <humbug> i mean night

[12:08:48] <ryrych> humbug: today is full moon, so the night will be bright :D
[12:09:13] <humbug> ryrych, yeap, wonna walk me?
[12:09:27] <juha____> whoa, i did manage to get some beef to the plugin, now it's 12 lines
[12:10:19] <Jantire> Why aren't the mouseOver/mouseOut events not running the functions they should be? user: sampleuser@sample.com pass:  sample123 url: http://46da.localtunnel.com
[12:10:26] <Jantire> (for #assignments_text)
[12:10:47] <Jantire> I want all other elements other than body on the page to have an opacity of 0.1 on mouseover of #assignments_text
[12:11:03] <ryrych> humbug: maybe I am a werewolf? :D
[12:11:13] <Jantire> and that works, but it won't go back on mouseout
[12:12:01] <humbug> ryrych, =) i am from russia, i slept with bears
[12:12:11] <humbug> i drink vodka every day

[12:13:21] <humbug> ryrych, i dont like vodka either, but Siberia is a nice place to live)
[12:13:37] <ekkis> (especially the gulag?)
[12:13:39] <humbug> ryrych, #jquery ....
[12:13:44] <colin3440> what does the '>' mean in this: $("#conn > li")
[12:13:44] <Jantire> Any help?
[12:13:54] <humbug> colin3440  parent
[12:14:04] <humbug> #conn is a parent of li
[12:14:08] <colin3440> so what's the difference between that and $("#conn li")?
[12:14:18] <humbug> or select li, which parent is #conn
[12:14:42] <humbug> dunno =)
[12:14:51] <ryrych> humbug: ok, #jquery but I had to start somehow :D
[12:14:58] <colin3440> ok cool! thans
[12:14:59] <colin3440> thanks
[12:15:13] <humbug> ))))))
[12:15:29] <Haprog> colin3440: with > the second element must e a direct child. without > it can be a grandchild also
[12:15:35] <Haprog> *be
[12:15:35] <humbug> nobody thanked me before for telling dunno...
[12:15:39] <ryrych> anyway, do you know when ajpiano gets up? I am looking forward to his reply to my e-mail :)
[12:15:51] <juha____> if anyone is interested, i published the first version just to jsfiddle :P http://jsfiddle.net/zMWex/
[12:15:54] <ryrych> I meant his timezone
[12:16:06] <ekkis> Jantire: I took a look but I don't know where the jquery is
[12:16:08] <shmu> Whirl3d: got anything nice for me ? :)
[12:16:31] <Jantire> assignments.js
[12:16:55] <humbug> $img.load() ?
[12:17:13] <humbug> juha____ why do you use .load?
[12:17:18] <humbug> you dont have to
[12:17:37] <Jantire> ekkis, It's at assignments.js
[12:17:44] <humbug> var x =  document.createElement("img");
[12:18:02] <humbug> x.setAttribute("src", path_to_it);
[12:18:06] <ryrych> humbug: why not $("<img />"); ?
[12:18:17] <humbug> document.body.appendChild(x);
[12:18:22] <juha____> no need to append
[12:18:22] <featureb> does anyone know of where people are keeping track of ongoing jquery mobile projects
[12:18:31] <humbug> because there is no use using that
[12:18:51] <juha____> humbug: your example is a lot more code
[12:18:52] <ajpiano> ryrych: you sent me an e-mail?
[12:18:55] <humbug> jQuery is a technology
[12:19:04] <juha____> humbug: does it have any performance gains?
[12:19:12] <ajpiano> ryrych: omg i just found it
[12:19:20] <ryrych> ajpiano: yup, this morning (11 hours ago?)
[12:19:21] <humbug> lolz i DO understand what my code does
[12:19:32] <ryrych> ajpiano: hope you can help me :)
[12:19:38] <humbug> and you - dont understand your own code
[12:19:49] <humbug> you think .load does some magick
[12:19:57] <humbug> but its not.
[12:19:57] <gnarf> binds to a load event
[12:20:02] <humbug> ololo
[12:20:09] <humbug> it does nothing in this code
[12:20:13] <humbug> just nothing
[12:20:16] <ekkis> Jantire: I downloaded it but it's all in a single line.  hard to read
[12:20:24] <ekkis> you should put together a test in jsfiddle
[12:20:28] <Whirl3d> schmu, sorry, had a call. Try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/wSQLC/1/
[12:20:46] <Jantire> Alright
[12:21:08] <humbug> juha____  sorry, but  return $("<img>").attr("src", obj) does the same thing
[12:21:25] <skamikaze> juha____: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks
[12:21:26] <urlicht1> I'm having trouble with moving checkbox inputs from one part of the dom to another: pls see https://gist.github.com/1027853. Problem is that the value of my checkbox "value" attributes are not moving over
[12:21:35] <skamikaze> juha____: ;)
[12:21:59] <juha____> skamikaze: ?
[12:22:02] <gnarf> urlicht1: low versions of IE?
[12:22:11] <urlicht1> gnarf: chrome 12
[12:22:15] <urlicht1> and ff 4
[12:22:42] <skamikaze> juha____: http://jscouch.de/ => jquery ajaxhooks
[12:22:46] <gnarf> can you put it in a fiddle urlicht1?
[12:23:00] <humbug> juha____: it is useful
[12:23:07] <humbug> try to read books
[12:23:10] <skamikaze> sry i had too much gulasz to explain anything atm :p
[12:23:16] <humbug> dont read fucking @helps@
[12:23:31] <humbug> you need to understand the process
[12:23:41] <humbug> and to write algorythms
[12:23:58] <juha____> skamikaze: did you share that link regarding my code or was there something else?
[12:24:17] <skamikaze> juha____: yes regarding to your js fiddle $.fn.imgfoo
[12:24:23] <humbug> >________<
[12:24:31] <humbug> bb
[12:24:43] <shmu> Whirl3d: looking now..
[12:25:12] <ajpiano> ryrych: this isn't really a good pattern
[12:25:16] <ajpiano> it would make a lot more sense
[12:25:20] <shmu> thanks Whirl3d
[12:25:23] <gnarf> urlicht1: are you changing the value attr in code at all?
[12:25:28] <shmu> the whole issue is that "scriptList" will be [ ]
[12:25:31] <shmu> it will be empty
[12:25:41] <USvER> Hello )
[12:25:43] <shmu> even though there are script tags
[12:25:44] <ajpiano> if you had the function to build the lightbox outside of create
[12:25:49] <ajpiano> so it was just private to the widget
[12:26:10] <urlicht1> gnarf: not at all... I'm wrapping part of my form inputs with a jquery ui dialog (they are optional). Since UI moves the dialog out of the form element, when the form is submitted the inputs aren't there. I'm trying to just move them back into the form so they are submitted
[12:26:14] <ajpiano> and then you would like, use the various widgets to notify that lightbox object that they were active
[12:26:17] <ajpiano> and to present their content
[12:26:23] <USvER> I nead text input field to have focus all the time... how to do it?
[12:26:27] <gnarf> ajpiano / ryrych i swear i suggested that as step 1 like yesterday
[12:26:37] <ajpiano> lol
[12:26:41] <ajpiano> i believe you gnarf :)
[12:26:41] <Whirl3d> shmu, the scriptList is the a list you provide of html documents (that have script tags inside them)
[12:27:00] <urlicht1> gnarf: and I've tried just moving the whole dialog div with appendTo, but no matter how I move the damn inputs, the checkbox values are just dropped
[12:27:03] <gnarf> ryrych: it was you I told you should reorganize to right?
[12:27:26] <Whirl3d> that could easily be just one URL as your source, I just added the multiple loader cause I often have several scripts to load
[12:27:36] <shmu> Whirl3d: there are script tags inside. the problem that they are not found using .find..
[12:27:41] <USvER> Is this is possible to have never losing focus input field?
[12:27:45] <gnarf> urlicht1: :/ what version of jQuery out of curiosity? and can you get a >simple< fiddle reproduction of the bug?
[12:28:01] <jeffsmykil> This may be ludicrous, but is it possible that IE 7 is doing math differently then say FF?
[12:28:06] <ekkis> Jantire: sorry, but it's too difficult to tear your stuff apart.  a jsfiddle will be easier
[12:28:12] <urlicht1> gnarf: 1.5.1, and I'm trying to right now... first time with this fiddle thing ;)
[12:28:14] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: what kind of math?
[12:28:15] <Whirl3d> USvER, they are found so long as you specify the dataType, and don't append them to the dom before .find
[12:28:17] <ryrych> gnarf: yes, it was me, but I was extremely tired at the time hence might not understand it well :D
[12:28:34] <gnarf> ryrych: well --- see ?logs go back and read what i said, and ask some questions
[12:28:35] <bot-t1> ryrych, Logs: http://lampoon.gurpartap.com/bot/log/jquery
[12:28:38] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: css("right", ((maxWidth + (10)) * (y - 1)) + "px")
[12:28:48] <rapta> is there anyway to make .load not by async?
[12:28:58] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: does ie7 support max-width?
[12:28:59] <Jantire> ekkis, I'm looking into it right now
[12:29:02] <rapta> i am loading 12 images and sticking them into a div, but they are happening out of order
[12:29:06] <USvER> Whirl3d is it for me? cos i can't understand
[12:29:17] <jeffsmykil> gnard that's a variable
[12:29:24] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: that's a variable
[12:29:29] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: i assume its the value of something's max-width ?
[12:29:31] <Whirl3d> shmu, when you load an html doc, before attaching it to the dom, log it to the console. YOu will see the script tags. Then attach to the dom and they will not be there any longer
[12:29:41] <jeffsmykil> gnarf yeah
[12:29:48] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: is it what you think it is?
[12:30:15] <shmu> so i guess its the same bug i am having Whirl3d. or a side effect of it..
[12:30:27] <USvER> Can some1 help me with focus() lostfocus()?
[12:30:29] <Whirl3d> shmu, do you have a fiddle?
[12:30:46] <gnarf> USvER: wtf is lostfocus, maybe you mean see ?blur
[12:30:47] <bot-t1> USvER, .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[12:31:04] <USvER> gnarf there is lostfocus()
[12:31:05] <rapta> fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8DqNK/
[12:31:14] <gnarf> USvER: there is?
[12:31:24] <Whirl3d> Yeah bot-t1, hooray
[12:31:35] <rapta> the .load for the 75x75 images is being called async instead of sync, how do I change that?
[12:31:39] <shmu> Whirl3d: looking at http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/wSQLC/1/
[12:31:40] <gnarf> USvER: http://cl.ly/2Q1u41021D3Z2Z2W3q3l
[12:32:11] <Whirl3d> shmu, I mean that you are working on.
[12:32:21] <shmu> oh no i dont
[12:33:51] <Caraes_Naur> is there a way to make datepicker.formatDate put seconds in the altField instead of milliseconds?
[12:35:00] <urlicht1> gnarf: I'm having trouble getting the fiddle working, but this is exactly what I'm doing http://jsfiddle.net/fTF8a/
[12:37:19] <jeffsmykil> gnarf FF thinks the answer is 247, FF thinks the answer is 291
[12:37:40] <ryrych> gnarf: I got it down and it is how I understand it: in the _create, call _getLightboxDialog() and check if global var denoting structure is created. If not, create it and return it.
[12:37:44] <ryrych> gnarf: 2)
[12:37:47] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: so, maxWidth and "y" are different?
[12:38:54] <jeffsmykil> y is the number in the for loop gnarf
[12:39:01] <ryrych> gnarf: before I continue, tell me if it is right
[12:39:14] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: so I assume that means maxWidth different
[12:39:32] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: like i suggested earlier, have you tried alerting its value?
[12:39:50] <gnarf> ryrych: seems smarter than what you had so far
[12:40:18] <ryrych> gnarf: OK, but I don't understand this:  	c) i think you should look at actually using ui.dialog for the lightbox itself
[12:40:26] <ajpiano> ryrych: the function shouldn't be attached to the widget instance, it should just be hanging in the closure, before you call $.widget
[12:40:45] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: ill just have to step through the js in both browsers
[12:41:24] <gnarf> ryrych: ajpiano's suggestion works too... I was suggesting that you use ui.dialog to do your lightbox
[12:41:36] <gnarf> make the actual lightbox a dialog
[12:42:40] <ryrych> gnarf: OK, as for ui.dialog I think about it :)
[12:43:22] <GoGoGarrett_> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/ymPG3/  How can I get rid of the image flicker
[12:44:13] <ryrych> ajpiano: by ‘the function’ what function do you mean? You meant creating the DOM outside the widget factory?
[12:44:22] <ajpiano> yes
[12:44:32] <ajpiano> so that it's "private" - but shared by all widgets
[12:44:45] <jowee> working with ui dialog, dynamically creating them like so: http://pastie.org/2073973, but once the 'x' is clicked and it is closed, the element is removed and cant recreate the dialog
[12:45:13] <ryrych> ajpiano: OK, I see, but what widgets do you mean to notify the plugin?
[12:45:26] <ryrych> or controlls
[12:45:30] <ajpiano> the .test() widgets on which thing is called
[12:45:45] <ajpiano> are able to access the private dialog
[12:45:49] <ajpiano> or lightbox
[12:45:51] <ajpiano> or what have you
[12:46:35] <jeffsmykil> i need a rubber ducky bad
[12:46:39] <superjacaman> hi everyone
[12:47:18] <dtach> hi someone
[12:47:49] <superjacaman> Anyone know a way to i see if a class exists before or after a element?
[12:48:16] <GoGoGarrett_> hasClass maybe?
[12:48:40] <ajpiano> superjacaman this.prev(".foo").length
[12:48:42] <ajpiano> etc
[12:49:16] <gnarf> ajpiano: prevAll ?
[12:49:29] <ajpiano> maybe maybe not
[12:49:33] <gnarf> aye
[12:49:36] <ajpiano> i just happened to have literally written the exact code in my app
[12:49:39] <ajpiano> and only needed prev :p
[12:49:42] <urlicht1> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/fTF8a/9/, working, and of course it's fine on jsfiddle, but on machine the "value" value is just dropped
[12:49:44] <urlicht1> W T F
[12:49:54] <urlicht1> *my machine
[12:50:02] <gnarf> urlicht1: so, this fiddle is working?
[12:50:09] <USvER> gnarf you are right
[12:50:20] <USvER> gnarf, why this not works http://jsfiddle.net/PCKqp/1/
[12:50:32] <gnarf> USvER: i'm not gonna help you trap my mouse
[12:50:35] <gnarf> sorry
[12:50:39] <gnarf> or rather my "focus"
[12:50:50] <gnarf> horrible design issues
[12:51:02] <USvER> gnarf?
[12:51:16] <urlicht1> gnarf: yes
[12:51:33] <gnarf> urlicht1: hrm - so whats different between the fiddle environment and your case?
[12:51:38] <urlicht1> gnarf: and what's worse is that it doesn't reproduce the issue I'm seeing, even though it's using nearly exactly the same code
[12:51:54] <ryrych> ajpiano: hm, but when the lightbox is run, there is an overlay behind it, so you can't click the element, widget was initiated on
[12:52:13] <ryrych> ajpiano: or I get it wrong?
[12:52:17] <urlicht1> gnarf: I'm going to try the exact same test case locally
[12:52:23] <USvER> Can some1 help me with  focus()?
[12:52:33] <USvER> and blur()
[12:53:18] <superjacaman> Found it $(this).nextAll().is(".selected")
[12:53:59] <gnarf> superjacaman: .nextAll(".selected").length might be better
[12:54:01] <USvER> $("#inputField").focus().blur(function(){$(this).focus();}); Not working
[12:54:22] <gnarf> USvER: maybe because you're trying to focus the element being blured
[12:54:22] <z3yo> Hi there
[12:54:26] <USvER> Some1 can help to make never losing focus input field
[12:54:42] <gnarf> USvER: that just sounds like a absolutely horrible design / idea
[12:55:00] <USvER> that's preaty amazing design
[12:55:08] <hobs> ol
[12:55:09] <necromancer> lol
[12:55:18] <USvER> i can explain
[12:55:20] <gnarf> pretty amazing if you like the <blink> and <center> tags
[12:55:27] <USvER> i making chrome extension
[12:55:28] <nicetry> hello, I was wondering if it was possible (using malsups cycle plugin http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle ) if you could set differenth timeout lengths between slides? That way the first four slides display 1 every two seconds, and the firth slide stays for 5 seconds before returning to the first...etc...
[12:55:36] <z3yo> I'm wondering if the clone() of an element with an id might cause somes troubles ?
[12:55:43] <necromancer> USvER: jQuery is a DOM/Ajax framework...
[12:55:44] <USvER> and i nead user to be on that fien every time
[12:56:07] <rapta> why do .load calls inside of a .get call load async?
[12:56:21] <rapta> this is blowing my mind
[12:56:22] <USvER> necromancer exactly what i nead
[12:56:26] <gnarf> rapta: umm, try again with more words that make sense? :)
[12:56:50] <sean`> ?preloading @ juha____
[12:56:51] <bot-t1> juha____, Simple Preloading: $("<img/>").load(function(){}).attr("src",newsrc) <--- Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src. Need more options? imagesLoaded callback: http://gist.github.com/268257 ; BK's, with CSS powah: http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/107-jquery-image-preloader-plus-callbacks.html
[12:56:54] <USvER> So no1 can help me?
[12:57:00] <necromancer> USvER: nope. your code sucks.
[12:57:03] <sean`> juha____, Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src.
[12:57:12] <gnarf> sean`!
[12:57:12] <necromancer> ;)
[12:57:16] <rapta> I am getting a json object with a $.get request, and it contains an array of URLs of images that i Load with .load
[12:57:16] <USvER> necromancer your too then
[12:57:26] <rapta> and then those images get stuffed into a div
[12:57:31] <gnarf> rapta: .load() isn't used for loading images
[12:57:31] <sean`> gnarf, :)
[12:57:32] <z3yo> any idea ?
[12:57:34] <rapta> however the images are being loaded out of order
[12:57:44] <gnarf> rapta: maybe you meant to .attr('src', url)
[12:57:58] <necromancer> USvER: so you basically don't want to allow the user to not have focus on a particular input field
[12:58:06] <rapta> hmmm gnarf, it seems to be doing both
[12:58:11] <gnarf> rapta: also, the order in which the images load is NOT guarnteed
[12:58:14] <USvER> necromancer there is only 1 fieald
[12:58:26] <z3yo> Do you think the clone() of an element with an id might cause some troubles ?
[12:58:27] <USvER> necromancer and user realy nead it to be focused
[12:58:29] <rapta> theres no way to force the order?
[12:58:33] <gnarf> rapta: if you want to load them one at a time and in the order you specify, use a queue
[12:58:45] <gnarf> only load the next one when one finishes
[12:58:47] <nicetry> Has anyone ever used http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle and if so - know if its possible to change the length of time between specific slides?
[12:59:38] <Cryp71c> Is there anyway to re-submit an ajax POST without knowing where the POST was directed and - if so - is there anyway to resend it while modifying or adding something to the data that was transmitted?
[12:59:46] <MACscr> ok, i have an image that when i click it, i am using slideDown() to get a video to appear from above. What method should i use to get the clicked image to slide down as well, but i want it to actually end up hiding, but with the slide down style?
[13:00:04] <necromancer> USvER: what exactly is this accomplishing
[13:01:26] <USvER> necromancer there is a list... i have input field which doing quick search on a list and user can click on list items for manipulating but any second he neads to enter new search query
[13:01:53] <Shishire> USvER, bind a focus event for the field to all the list items
[13:02:04] <necromancer> USvER: okay well what your code was going to do (if it actually worked, which it won't) is not let the user click off the input field
[13:02:30] <Pierro> hi
[13:02:41] <Pierro> please if someone can look at this
[13:02:51] <USvER> necromancer there is links for quick actions like delete etc...
[13:02:53] <Pierro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1joXVI7EDw
[13:03:02] <Pierro> the page http://kakkoii.fr/
[13:03:18] <Pierro> It's seems like jquery mobiledon't load the javascript
[13:03:27] <Pierro> i have to refresh the second page for it work
[13:03:36] <Pierro> it's very important
[13:03:38] <USvER> necromancer so basicaly user input search query deleted 1 item and neds quickly anjust search query and delete some more
[13:03:38] <necromancer> USvER: easiest way would be to use a class to select all the list items and bind the focus event to focus on the input field
[13:03:45] <Pierro>  i will donate to jquery if someone tell me how to fix that ^^
[13:04:06] <necromancer> so when you click on a list item or whatever it just goes back to the input
[13:04:19] <gnarf> Pierro: you might want to try in #jquerymobile too
[13:04:34] <necromancer> link clicks should also be bound with .click() and have 'return false;' at the end
[13:04:36] <USvER> necromancer if user missclick... it will lose focus and user will be angry
[13:04:36] <Pierro> i have tried but nobody never answer
[13:04:44] <necromancer> lol
[13:04:58] <necromancer> i don't think the user is going to be angry
[13:05:10] <USvER> they angry right now
[13:05:17] <necromancer> who is?
[13:05:17] <USvER> and want me to fix this
[13:05:44] <USvER> all those who tested my extension
[13:05:53] <devsundar> In JQuery mobile is there a tab control?
[13:06:25] <Pierro> devsundar: do you talk about my problem ?
[13:06:47] <devsundar> Pierro: No, i just entered the room.
[13:06:52] <Pierro> ok ^^
[13:06:54] <devsundar> I am not aware of your problem
[13:07:06] <devsundar> if its related can you paste it again
[13:07:18] <ccmonster> i keep getting an error : targetElem is undefined , but I have no clue which targetElem  is actually causing the error
[13:07:24] <Pierro> don't think is related but it's a problem with jqm too ^^
[13:07:36] <devsundar> Pierro: ok
[13:07:45] <Pierro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1joXVI7EDw
[13:08:24] <USvER> necromancer,  is there some functionalty like default button... when user type somethin all input will be to that default field...
[13:08:36] <USvER> necromancer, i nead that functionalyty realy badly
[13:08:53] <Fernandos> hmm how can I call the a function on elements in the dom? I want them to be .sortable()
[13:09:07] <Jantire> Is there a new line event in jQuery for textarea?
[13:09:13] <devsundar> Is there any tab control in jQuery Mobile?
[13:09:19] <Fernandos> I used to use live with a click on the element.. which worked..but the click shouldn't be neccessary
[13:09:52] <necromancer> USvER: you could try to just capture key input with .keyup
[13:10:19] <necromancer> Fernandos: you want to do something like $('.myElements').sortable()?
[13:10:52] <Fernandos> yes necromancer
[13:11:06] <Fernandos> but the elements are in the dom from the beginning
[13:11:11] <USvER> necromancer, hm... mb that will work... but have capture all input from all document?
[13:11:15] <necromancer> that's okay
[13:11:21] <necromancer> Fernandos: you want to check this out http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[13:11:27] <z3yo> Do you think the clone() of an element with an id might cause some troubles ?
[13:11:46] <necromancer> USvER: it only captures input from the keyboard, not the mouse. focus/blur will also capture what the mouse does so people won't be able to click anything except the input field
[13:13:01] <USvER> necromancer, thank you... that was just my first gues on how to acomplish my task
[13:13:04] <necromancer> Fernandos: any function you call on a jQuery object (that's not part of core) is a plugin. that's how you make one. it's basically the same thing as a function/object that's tied to a specific DOM element. similar to making a function that takes a DOM element as its only parameter
[13:13:05] <Fernandos> necromancer: authoring? I'm using .sortable() but it's not working when the elements are in the dom, I just got it working when I bind it to a click event with live()
[13:13:11] <kba> My source code is a bit lengthy, so I'll just give it a shot with this: How can '$('#search form input').focus();' in any way cause some other item with class .hidden{display:none;} to be shown? It's not even in the div#search.
[13:13:36] <kba> I have not been able to reproduce the problem outside of my source code, and I can't figure out what's going on.
[13:13:41] <necromancer> Fernandos: oh i'm sorry i misread
[13:13:50] <necromancer> Fernandos: are you doing .sortable in a dom ready call?
[13:13:54] <gnarf> kba: it can't unless you have bound a focus event to that input that unhids that other item
[13:14:58] <Fernandos> necromancer: yes
[13:15:43] <GoGoGarrett_> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/AEdNM/ I'm getting an image flicker when changing slides, but I'm not sure why
[13:15:55] <kba> gnarf: well I haven't rebound .focus().
[13:20:38] <daniele> hello! I have a simple question: styling select input fields with CSS in not very nice. I have seen that the most common solution is to replace those with html and javascript. unfortunately jquery-ui does not contain any select widgets. what's the recommended solution?

[13:45:41] <bla> Hi.
[13:45:51] <janthony> Any idea why $('#contact-form').submit(function(){ doesn't work in google chrome?
[13:45:54] <Trisox> anyone can help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/10/ its a json problem cant get the values to fill
[13:45:56] <ccmonster> its a pain in the ass to debug because firebug doesn't tell me which line in my script causes the issue, just the jquery line
[13:46:11] <ch3mical> Trisox: looking
[13:46:15] <Trisox> k
[13:46:54] <ch3mical> Trisox: you have an extra } at the end of your JSON
[13:47:30] <ch3mical> Also use ?g jsonlint
[13:47:31] <bot-t1> ch3mical, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[13:47:32] <Trisox> nope
[13:47:40] <Trisox> its valid ;)
[13:48:04] <janthony> Anyone?
[13:48:13] <ch3mical> Oh, I only selected the inner string
[13:48:21] <ch3mical> Didn't see it starts at basket
[13:48:38] <ch3mical> But
[13:48:42] <ch3mical> That means it's NOT valid
[13:48:44] <Trisox> ;)
[13:48:52] <ccmonster> :)
[13:48:55] <ch3mical> Because you created an object literal there, not a JSON string
[13:49:20] <Trisox> mm how would you do it
[13:49:47] <bla> Software works on a test machine, we're currently moving it to the production server and jQuery stopped to accept server JSON. I suspect JSONP problem - the code did not change. Any ideas what to check?
[13:49:54] <bla> (We've cleared browser cache)
[13:50:46] <daniel3> janthony, well paste your code and maybe you can be helped.
[13:50:54] <daniel3> not in the channel, but on a pastebin site
[13:50:58] <bla> We don't generally use JSONP, but it happened twice that it worked similarly already.
[13:51:04] <tbranyen> ?pastie
[13:51:05] <bot-t1> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[13:51:06] <Shishire> bla, does the server understand the jsonp request?  Does it wrap it correctly?
[13:51:22] <Trisox> ch3mical: any idea?
[13:51:25] <bla> Shishire, it doesn't wrap it correctly and it shouldn't we don't request JSONP from jquery in no place.
[13:51:28] <ch3mical> Oops, I pasted it wrong, it is valid JSON :)
[13:51:36] <Trisox> :>
[13:51:44] <bla> Shishire, but it's true that there's this ?_ callback in requests (which works on test machine)
[13:51:54] <ch3mical> data.post_response doesn't exist in that JSON, however
[13:52:24] <Trisox> no but look @ firefox log of data ;)
[13:52:30] <Shishire> bla, if the data you're getting back doesn't have the callback wrapped around it, it won't get executed.
[13:53:09] <janthony> daniel3: http://pastie.org/2074319
[13:53:16] <Trisox> firefox = firebug
[13:53:24] <bla> Shishire, but it works on another machine, with the same code - and we just don't want to use JSONP. And we haven't enabled it anywhere.
[13:53:31] <janthony> test isn't logging when you submit the form
[13:54:17] <bla> (It works on 3 other machines - test, dev, and my own server.)
[13:55:05] <daniel3> janthony, whats with the $ inside of the ready(function ($)?
[13:55:23] <Shishire> bla, so your javascript code is requesting jsonp, but you've decided not to give it jsonp, and rather just return json, and your code no longer works?  Or do I have that wrong?
[13:55:34] <janthony> daniel3: allows me to use $ inside my jquery
[13:55:56] <janthony> daniel3: this site isn't in wordpress, but that is how WordPress prefers you to call jquery
[13:55:56] <ccmonster> what is target.nodeType ==9?
[13:56:02] <ccmonster> because im getting a strange error with that
[13:56:11] <bla> Shishire, I request normal json not using any crossdomain stuff, server responds with normal JSON (although there's _=number added by jquery) and it works on 4 machines but not on production.
[13:56:48] <janthony> daniel3: when the form is submitted it's submited by pressing enter, not hitting a submit button. Not sure if that has to with anything. The form should be submitting regardless when enter is hit. Works in Firefox but not chrome.
[13:56:54] <bla> I don't want to use JSONP and did not decide to use it. I even in some places explicitly tell jquery not to use jsonp
[13:57:19] <Shishire> ok, so in your javascript, you've turned off datatype:jsonp, and you're no longer getting parsable json from the production machine?
[13:57:50] <janthony> daniel3: I've ran into this before where .submit() didn't work in all browsers, but I forget the solution.
[13:57:58] <daniel3> have you tried using just the $.post function?
[13:58:00] <bla> There's datatype: 'json' explicitly stated in $.ajax request.
[13:58:29] <Shishire> ok, and the url that's being called with the ajax request isn't violating cross-site boundaries?
[13:58:41] <janthony> daniel3: you're missing my question. :P console.log('test') should be logging before you even get to the ajax. The ajax is not the problem, it's the .submit() not working. chrome is not even registering the .submit() event
[13:58:57] <ccmonster> what is target.nodeType ==9?
[13:59:03] <bla> Shishire, it shouldn't; It's the same server. Using https all the time.
[13:59:15] <ccmonster> im getting that or a targetElem is undefined error
[13:59:21] <Trisox> https?

[13:59:57] <ajpiano> k
[14:00:00] <ajpiano> !
[14:00:03] <Shishire> ok.  Have you checked exactly what's coming back from the server?  jQuery will not fire the callback if it recieves unparsable data back.
[14:00:05] <Trisox> hey ajpiano
[14:00:10] <Shishire> bla, ^^
[14:00:24] <bla> Hm. Test machine uses https too. Does it change anything? I'll read it, thanks
[14:00:33] <Trisox> dunno
[14:00:35] <bla> So you believe jquery beleives this is a crossdomain request.
[14:00:44] <Trisox> was wondering if it did
[14:00:50] <janthony> http://pastie.org/2074319 - Anyone know why my submit function won't work in chrome? Works fine in Firefox. test isn't logging in chrome console either, which tells me the event isn't even registering.

[14:01:45] <ccmonster> i keep finding this error popping up
[14:02:19] <Shishire> bla, try firebug or something equivalent, and watch the request fire from the net tab.  I've had times where I'm actually getting back an error, or an unquoted string, and it drops the response because of that.
[14:03:58] <bla> Shishire, yeah, I'm instructing someone. It's funny but I haven't got access to production machine
[14:04:05] <bla> So I'm trying to learn someone about breakpoints...
[14:04:24] <bla> Responses are 200 OK with correct JSON that's sure.
[14:04:31] <Trisox> anyone can help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/10/ its a json problem cant get the values to fill
[14:04:56] <janthony> Looks like the submit event isn't working in IE either, only Chrome.
[14:04:59] <janthony> er, Firefox
[14:05:07] <Shishire> bla, not necessarily.  Check what the return value is.  Just because the server sends 200 OK doesn't mean it's actually sending back parsable data.
[14:05:14] <janthony> .submit() works in FF, but not Chrome/Safari/IE...
[14:06:17] <bla> Shishire, I've checked the returned data already with json parser
[14:06:19] <Woet> janthony: .submit works fine on all browsers, show your  code on jsfiddle
[14:06:26] <bla> Shishire, I'm not implying correct json based on http response
[14:06:30] <ccmonster> hola ajpiano
[14:06:44] <Shishire> bla, ok.  Umm... I don't know.
[14:07:11] <janthony> Woet: Does it work if you don't click a submit button? My form has the submit button hidden. You have to press Enter to submit the form.
[14:07:21] <Woet> janthony: works fine for me
[14:07:24] <ajpiano> hi
[14:07:27] <ajpiano> ccmonster:
[14:07:37] <Woet> i have hidden submit buttons too :)
[14:07:49] <janthony> Woet: DId you see my pastie?
[14:07:49] <bla> From debugging it seems that url passed to $.ajax is relative; /page/page2 nothing fancy... should be same-domain
[14:07:56] <Woet> janthony: yes, put it on jsfiddle
[14:08:07] <Woet> ?paste
[14:08:08] <kam187osx> hey guys, does jquery optimise its functions for the browser / phone type?
[14:08:10] <Woet> hm
[14:08:17] <Woet> why did someone kill bot-t again
[14:08:18] <Woet> :(
[14:08:38] <Trisox> ?botsnack
[14:08:40] <janthony> Woet: Do I need to put the css on there as well?
[14:08:42] <Trisox> :(
[14:08:47] <Woet> janthony: unless it's relevant, no
[14:08:54] <Woet> just .hidden will suffice i suppose
[14:10:15] <ccmonster> ajpiano, im getting a jquery error in the chrome console that says : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined
[14:10:31] <ajpiano> i'm literally leaving the computer this second
[14:10:33] <ajpiano> sorry
[14:10:36] <ccmonster> no problemo.
[14:10:38] <ccmonster> take care.
[14:10:42] <ccmonster> run while you can.
[14:10:43] <ccmonster> :)
[14:10:48] <ajpiano> heh
[14:11:31] <Woet> speaking of leaving, my battery runs out in 9 minutes janthony
[14:11:34] <Woet> gogogo!
[14:11:46] <janthony> ok
[14:11:55] <janthony> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/q4mae/
[14:13:20] <Woet> janthony: display: none; actually disables the enter on the compliant browsers
[14:13:37] <Woet> try height: 0; width: 0;
[14:14:34] <Woet> janthony: I use <input type="submit" value="Proceed to the next step" style="height: 0px; width: 0px; border: none; padding: 0px;" hidefocus="true" />
[14:14:46] <Woet> completely hidden, won't be reached using tab, but enter works :)
[14:15:42] <Woet> janthony: http://jsfiddle.net/q4mae/1/
[14:16:35] <janthony> Woet: you rock! thank you!
[14:18:40] <Woet> janthony: good luck!
[14:20:43] <Fernandos> hmm does jquery some kind of locking when I work with a dom element, so that I cannot access it when I in example drag it?
[14:21:10] <Fernandos> because I wonder why I sometimes get undefinded.. and sometimes don't..
[14:21:28] <daniel3> I had an interesting situation happen to me with the .submit function.  Was trying to use it on multiple forms that were being dynamically made through php.  Ended up having to embed each .submit function within each function from the .post function.
[14:23:04] <Fernandos> daniel3: hmm did you try live('submit',function(event) {.. ?
[14:23:25] <daniel3> no, never used .live
[14:23:34] <Fernandos> I think that should do the trick..
[14:24:54] <daniel3> probably would have saved me more code
[14:26:48] <daniel3> Fernandos, each form was pulled into a different div, with different IDs, and each form had different id's, would .live work with something like that?
[14:26:57] <Fernandos> yeah I think so.. I've some ugly code which ajaxfies the whole backend  (obstrusive), that I needed to fix.. live helped me
[14:27:05] <funnylookinhat> Is there a jQuery plugin that takes drag-dropped files and allows you to create NEW <input file> elements with those files?  As far as I know you can't do that because the path sent for the file is spoofed (only the filename is correct)
[14:29:00] <Trisox> daniel3 use this and form and submit
[14:29:03] <Trisox> ;)
[14:30:00] <Trisox> funnylookinhat: you need ui components and live it might work
[14:30:21] <funnylookinhat> Trisox, UI Components - you mean jQuery UI ?
[14:30:29] <Trisox> jea
[14:30:38] <fourcolors> Hi. I'm using the jquery ui functions and I'm trying to sort a list of items. I would like an alert box to show up with the current items position. My code currently looks something like this. http://pastie.org/2074485
[14:30:41] <Trisox> for drag and drop
[14:31:15] <fourcolors> I looked at the documentation and it says i should be able to use ui.position however every time I do that, it says "ui.position is not a function"
[14:31:16] <Trisox> clone the path of the file or something..
[14:31:25] <funnylookinhat> Trisox, I don't want to be able to drag elements, I want people to be able to drag files from their OS onto my web app  :)
[14:31:40] <Trisox> you cant with js..
[14:31:45] <funnylookinhat> HTML5 ?
[14:31:48] <Trisox> you need html5
[14:31:56] <fourcolors> funnylookinhat: look at pluploader you can do it with that but it's html5
[14:32:17] <funnylookinhat> fourcolors, Cool thanks - HTML5 is fine - I don't expect this sort of thing to work in IE or anything anyways...
[14:32:32] <Trisox> sean` made one also
[14:32:45] <fourcolors> funnylookinhat: then pluploader is ur friend
[14:33:10] <fourcolors> it also has some pretty neat fall backs.. I'm obviously a fan so far at least
[14:33:16] <Trisox> might need flash/javaaplets *ugh*  for ie
[14:33:42] <Trisox> pluploader sounds nice ;)
[14:35:02] <fourcolors> ya it's the good stuff ha.
[14:36:01] <goose84> Is it possible to set a global var based upon a success of an ajax call
[14:40:02] <Trisox> ?extended
[14:40:12] <Trisox> no idea goose84
[14:40:37] <ngharo> sure you can
[14:41:47] <Trisox> with out var
[14:42:00] <Trisox> makes them global was it not..
[14:42:15] <Trisox> var binding them to the function something like that
[14:43:13] <goose84> I wanna do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ufqmJ/
[14:43:17] <goose84> but its not working
[14:43:36] <mdpatrick> How do I use jquery to clear elements of their default values when I hit the submit button (so that they are NOT posted)
[14:44:25] <goose84> can someone explain why
[14:46:07] <Trisox> cause your jquery aint valid
[14:46:33] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/ufqmJ/2/
[14:46:41] <Trisox> try that
[14:47:18] <Trisox> you didnt close success:
[14:48:00] <Trisox> mdpatrick values as in val?
[14:48:47] <ch3mical> Trisox: sorry, I got pulled away, didn't finish looking at your JSON issue
[14:49:04] <Trisox> i'm hehe still dindt figure it out
[14:49:18] <Trisox> pain in the but
[14:49:36] <Trisox> ch3mical: thnx for looking ;)
[14:50:19] <goose84> http://jsfiddle.net/ufqmJ/3/
[14:50:30] <goose84> nope it alerts an empty string
[14:50:32] <Trisox> ch3mical http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/10/
[14:54:14] <fourcolors> anyone have experience with jquery ui sortable? When I get an items index() it's not accurate
[14:54:46] <Trisox> goose84 googled and found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/905298/jquery-storing-ajax-response-into-global-variable
[14:55:07] <fourcolors> for instance, when I have 5 items and I drag the first item to the 5th position, the ui.item.index() says it's position 8 but clearly it should be position 5 or maybe 4 in an array sense
[14:55:22] <fourcolors> I don't see how it could possibly be 8
[14:55:48] <Trisox> stupid connection
[14:59:39] <d4rklit3> ok.. so i broke fancy box somehow
[14:59:49] <devinrolsen> :( no so fancy anymore?
[14:59:57] <d4rklit3> i was adding tons of shit to my site here and then at some point which i dont know... it stopped working
[15:00:08] <d4rklit3> now i can't figure out where i went wrong  : /
[15:00:17] <d4rklit3> devinrolsen: no.. not fancy
[15:01:17] <devinrolsen> sorry, wish I could help. I'm just not a big fan of fancy box.
[15:01:35] <d4rklit3> well i can't go back now
[15:01:39] <d4rklit3> its already written in
[15:01:42] <d4rklit3> i just need to fix it
[15:02:06] <hye> hi.
[15:02:27] <Trisox> lol http://i.fokzine.net/upload/11/06/110614_97351_diesel_engine.jpg
[15:02:34] <hye> I am using jquery to do a page fadein and fadeout effect when user navigations from a link to another page.  however the transition is unstable and is not smooth. any ideas?
[15:02:42] <d4rklit3> the only clue i have is that it broke in different places implementing it in differnt ways
[15:02:55] <Trisox> jquery ui dialog for the win!
[15:03:03] <ryanneufeld> oh god, I just spent like 10mins in ##php harshed my mello hard
[15:03:23] <Trisox> ##php are unkind
[15:03:43] <Shishire> Trisox, nice pic, made me lol
[15:03:48] <Trisox> :D
[15:04:07] <Trisox> funny for sure
[15:04:13] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: some guy was arguing that using global vars was okay cause he had a map of his project
[15:04:23] <ryanneufeld> but he was the only dev, clearly
[15:04:36] <Trisox> ah
[15:04:48] <Shishire> hmmm... self-documenting code mean anything?
[15:05:04] <Trisox> :D
[15:05:06] <Trisox> gege
[15:05:12] <ryanneufeld> Shishire: yeah, we tried
[15:05:18] <ryanneufeld> I just ragequit the channel
[15:05:20] <ryanneufeld> lol
[15:05:30] <Trisox> right on yea
[15:05:50] <Shishire> ryanneufeld, There's not much you can do for people who refuse to learn.  For everyone else though, channels like this exist :)
[15:06:00] <ryanneufeld> this channel is great
[15:06:13] <Trisox> yup most of the time :D
[15:06:13] <ryanneufeld> <3 bot-t when it's here
[15:06:48] <Trisox> any who any one got some time to look @ this ?  http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/10/
[15:07:07] <Trisox> cant get the json back  in the each loop
[15:08:07] <ryanneufeld> one of the moderators actually suggested to someone that they use JSON for an application config
[15:08:07] <ryanneufeld> like in each page do $config = json_decode(file_get_contents(config.json));
[15:08:23] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: I'll take a quick peek for you
[15:08:30] <Trisox> thnx
[15:09:27] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: what am I looking at here
[15:09:47] <Shishire> umm... json for php configuration?  I mean json isn't terrible for config, but... since it's a scripting language, doesn't php generally work pretty well for php config?
[15:10:00] <Trisox> json mocked data
[15:10:28] <Trisox> i wanna retrieve the whats in the each
[15:10:33] <Trisox> i get my jsonback
[15:10:46] <Trisox> but dunno how to call it
[15:11:09] <Shishire> Trisox, this
[15:11:33] <Shishire> $.each exposes the current value with the "this" variable
[15:11:48] <Trisox> console.log(this.lineId); = undefined
[15:12:23] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: cause you want $.each(this.basket.articles)
[15:12:28] <ryanneufeld> rather
[15:12:31] <Shishire> console.log(this)
[15:12:32] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: cause you want $.each(data.basket.articles)
[15:12:40] <Shishire> see what's in it.
[15:12:40] <Trisox> mmm
[15:13:15] <Trisox> console.log(data.basket.articles.lineId); =  undefined
[15:14:18] <Trisox> dunno whats wrong same goes for this
[15:15:47] <Shishire> Trisox, are you actually getting data back?
[15:16:07] <Trisox> yea check console firebug
[15:16:10] <Trisox> you will see
[15:16:21] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[15:16:30] <zjk> is it possible to change animate() speed during the animation ?
[15:16:37] * MeCooL Hi
[15:16:37] <ryanneufeld> oic
[15:16:57] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: what's happening is that your json data is being turned into form data
[15:17:09] <Trisox> it doenst
[15:17:13] <Koen_> you can use animation types
[15:17:15] <Shishire> Trisox, what variable are you passing into $.each?
[15:17:16] <Koen_> tweens
[15:17:27] <ryanneufeld> so the keys are coming back as basket[articles][0][lineId]
[15:17:35] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: yes, it does, That's what I'm trying to tell you
[15:17:42] <ryanneufeld> $.post is like doing a form submit
[15:18:19] <Shishire> ryanneufeld, it's a service designed to spit it back.  He's acutally getting the data back
[15:18:28] <ryanneufeld> yes, I know that
[15:18:32] <ryanneufeld> but it's how it's coming back
[15:19:51] <Trisox> its prob something stupid but cant figure it out
[15:20:22] <Trisox> how it coming back ?
[15:20:30] <Koen_> Trisox, you want to call json ?
[15:20:36] <Trisox> it send to jsfiddle server and returned
[15:20:58] <Koen_> but the return isnt json ?
[15:21:02] <Koen_> $.json()
[15:21:19] <Shishire> hahaha
[15:21:22] <Shishire> figured it out
[15:21:26] <Koen_> $.post('url', {data: data}, function() { callbackstuff }, 'json')
[15:21:56] <Shishire> Trisox, the correct key for the first line of data returned should be "basket[articles][0][lineId]"
[15:22:03] <Shishire> so... data["basket[articles][0][lineId]"]
[15:22:10] <ryanneufeld> Shishire: but that's not how he wants it back
[15:22:16] <Trisox> mmm
[15:22:33] <Trisox> not realy indeed
[15:22:40] <Koen_> whats the format ?
[15:23:06] <Trisox> json
[15:23:10] <Shishire> ryanneufeld, yeah, but that's what's coming back.  It's being returned as a flat json response.  The service you're using is weird
[15:23:16] <Koen_> i mean, you want a subset of the json right ?
[15:23:21] <Koen_> but you cant access it ?
[15:23:37] <Shishire> ryanneufeld is probably right, try it with a .ajax, instead of a .post
[15:23:41] <Trisox> nope ill post it1 sex
[15:23:48] <ryanneufeld> Shishire: it's not my service
[15:23:55] <ryanneufeld> and that's the problem i'm pointing out
[15:24:00] <ryanneufeld> he's not getting valid JSON back
[15:24:02] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/XRRSF/10/
[15:24:10] <Shishire> ryanneufeld, sorry, mean't he's using
[15:24:17] <Trisox> jsonlint says it is
[15:24:27] <GoGoGarrett_> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/jYK5q/   I'm not sure how to properly append an array into a div
[15:24:50] <GoGoGarrett_> crap, have a type-o in that post.
[15:24:54] <xochilpili> i cant load a datepicker in a html file named "datepicker.html" with $("#content").load("datepicker.html")
[15:25:04] <xochilpili> is it possible ?
[15:25:13] <Trisox> Koen_: indeed subset
[15:25:20] <Shishire> Trisox, nah, look at the outgoing data sent from your .post
[15:25:21] <Koen_> do you know the difference between [val, val, val] and {key: val, key: val}
[15:25:26] <xochilpili> anyone ?
[15:25:57] <Trisox> what would you recommend?
[15:25:59] <Koen_> why would you want that xochilpili ?
[15:26:08] <Koen_> i dont know how the data looks
[15:26:20] <d4rklit3> this fancybox shit is completely insane, it works at all instances except when it is loaded for the first time, i get a "cannot load requested" content error but i check all the values of the element and everything is in there. like there is no reason why fancybox should not be able to load, unless somehow it can't load fancybox scripts even though they are before the rest of my scripts in the head. This makes no fucking sense at all. and im about to quit
[15:26:27] <Koen_> because /ajax_json_echo/ is unaccessable for me haha
[15:26:42] <Trisox> koen_ thats jsfiddle thiny
[15:26:47] <Shishire> Trisox, do .ajax, specify post manually, and do JSON.stringify() on your data object before you send it.
[15:26:48] <Trisox> i send the mockup json
[15:26:59] <Trisox> in top of the js section
[15:27:00] <GoGoGarrett_> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/jYK5q/1/  fixed my syntax
[15:27:04] <xochilpili> Koen_ im trying to load a form which is in "datepicker.html"  into my index.html
[15:27:05] <Trisox> and get it returned
[15:27:17] <Shishire> or just .stringify your object, rather than including it as the data
[15:27:48] <Koen_> xochilpili should just work...
[15:27:55] <Koen_> 		header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate');
[15:27:55] <Koen_> 		header('Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT');
[15:27:56] <Koen_> 		header('Content-type: application/json');
[15:27:59] <Koen_> add that to your php
[15:28:26] <xochilpili> Koen_, oks
[15:28:45] <Koen_> no
[15:28:49] <Koen_> not you haha
[15:28:50] <Trisox> Shishire: im confinced it should be able with $.post
[15:28:51] <Koen_> trisox
[15:28:58] <Trisox> i dont use php
[15:29:04] <Koen_> oh ok
[15:29:08] <Trisox> its json mockup
[15:29:11] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: I see what's happening
[15:29:15] <xochilpili> Koen_, anyway it does not work
[15:29:15] <Trisox> i load fakeData
[15:29:19] <Shishire> Trisox
[15:29:25] <ryanneufeld> when you post to the echo endpoint
[15:29:29] <Koen_> try .post('url', {data: data}, function() { callbackstuff }, 'json')
[15:29:31] <ryanneufeld> it's like a form post
[15:29:33] <Koen_> $.post('url', {data: data}, function() { callbackstuff }, 'json')
[15:29:36] <Trisox> yup ryanneufeld
[15:29:49] <Koen_> you are missing 'json'
[15:29:51] <Trisox> its a jsfiddle service
[15:29:53] <Koen_> as last parameter in the post
[15:29:53] <ryanneufeld> since you've passed an object to the .POST and not STRING it's not coming back
[15:30:00] <xochilpili> Koen_, http://fpaste.org/wwV0/
[15:30:05] <xochilpili> thats my datepicker
[15:30:19] <Koen_> <div id="calendar"/>
[15:30:22] <Koen_> tag is not closed
[15:30:25] <Koen_> <div id="calendar"></div>
[15:31:03] <xochilpili> Koen_, if i ran datepicker.html alone, it works, but it does not show in the $("content") div
[15:31:06] <Koen_> should be $("#date").datepicker({ altField: 'input#date', altFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' });
[15:31:08] <Koen_> btw
[15:31:30] <Koen_> what the hell are you trying to do? datepicker should be on the input element
[15:31:41] <ryanneufeld> Koen_: That's the dataType you're expecting BACK from the server
[15:31:44] <ryanneufeld> not what to send it
[15:31:56] <Koen_>  type="textbox" => type="text"
[15:32:02] <Koen_> ohhh
[15:32:03] <Koen_> ok
[15:32:09] <Koen_> let me see
[15:34:13] <Koen_> ryannefeld
[15:34:17] <Koen_> its not true what you say
[15:34:17] <xochilpili> Koen_, i changed to this > http://fpaste.org/juph/
[15:34:22] <xochilpili> but does not work either
[15:34:26] <Koen_> 'json' as last parameter does affect the post values
[15:34:35] <Shishire> Trisox, got it, give me a moment to clean it up.  It's not pretty, but it works.
[15:34:50] <Trisox> i'm looking forward to it
[15:34:59] <Koen_> xochilpili does it work ?
[15:35:16] <madprops> how can i check if a plugin works for a certain jquery version?
[15:35:17] <ryanneufeld> Koen_: it only effects how .post interprets the servers respones, which isn't a problem in our case
[15:35:47] <Koen_> really i thought it was different.. will look into it again
[15:35:47] <xochilpili> it works if i ran datepicker.html alone, without another html with $("#content").load("datepicker.html");
[15:35:56] <xochilpili> does not work
[15:37:23] <Koen_> trisox
[15:37:27] <Koen_> try adding format: "json"
[15:37:28] <Trisox> yea
[15:37:36] <Koen_> as last  one on the data array
[15:37:58] <Shishire> http://jsfiddle.net/wZKSw/
[15:38:21] <ryanneufeld> Koen_: THAT WON"T FIX THIS
[15:38:27] <Trisox> indeed ;)
[15:38:35] <Shishire> There are better ways to do it.  But that actually gets data.  Your best bet is getting jquery to expect the right kind of data.
[15:38:37] <ryanneufeld> FFS, the problem is the data being SENT
[15:38:53] <Shishire> Trisox ^^^
[15:39:00] <Koen_>             "totalPrice": 2.2
[15:39:00] <Koen_>         }
[15:39:00] <Koen_>     ]},
[15:39:00] <Koen_>     format: "json"
[15:39:02] <Koen_> like that i mean
[15:39:09] <Trisox> nice Shishire
[15:39:39] <Shishire> That link has a working implementation.  It's kinda ugly and hacky, but it does get the data back
[15:40:06] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/XRRSF/11/
[15:40:29] <xochilpili> Koen_, any hand ?
[15:40:40] <a_L_p> I am trying to make a simply interface where an h2 is clicked and content is shown, and then if it is clicked again, the content is hidden... can anyone tell me why this isn't working? http://d.pr/DErz
[15:41:11] <ryanneufeld> I don't know what it is you're trying to accomplish in your each
[15:41:24] <Trisox> ryanneufeld: that indeed does reply json not objects
[15:41:24] <Shishire> a_L_p, try .live
[15:41:33] <ryanneufeld> but it's a simpler version of what Shishire gave you
[15:41:58] <ryanneufeld> Trisox: I think you can take it from here
[15:42:00] <ryanneufeld> afk
[15:42:19] <Shishire> I'm off, everyone enjoy.
[15:42:23] <Trisox> ill take a look at both
[15:42:27] <xochilpili> i try with a function called from <body onload="start();"> which contains just an alert.  When i load datepicker.html from $("#content").load("datepicker.html"); does not show the alert in that function
[15:42:28] <GoGoGarrett_> http://jsfiddle.net/GoGoGarrett/jYK5q/4/  I can't seem to figure out how to append content from my array onto the page
[15:42:29] <Trisox> thnx ryanneufeld and Shishire
[15:42:33] <Trisox> good start from there
[15:42:42] <Trisox> have an nice evening
[15:43:01] <ryanneufeld> you too
[15:43:03] <trumpetmic> is anyone using ixedit?
[15:43:17] <trumpetmic> if so, mind helping me get it running on a page (on my mac)?
[15:43:25] <xochilpili> anyhand ?
[15:43:27] <Koen_> http://jsfiddle.net/XRRSF/12/
[15:43:40] <Trisox> :)
[15:44:09] <Koen_> dont know if it works
[15:44:17] <Koen_> but i thought i could remember something like that
[15:44:39] <ngharo> GoGoGarrett_: http://jsfiddle.net/jYK5q/5/
[15:44:41] <Trisox> doesnt help much koen
[15:44:52] <magcius> is it possible to have an ajax 'GET' request with a body?
[15:45:02] <magcius> 'data' adds it as a query string
[15:45:59] <Koen_> ok sorry man =P
[15:46:27] <GoGoGarrett_> ngharo that still doesn't append it to the div container sadly, but your edits do seem to be a better way of pushing haha
[15:46:28] <Jon47> magcius yep, you'll have to pass all the data in the querystring, which means there's some esoteric upper limit to how big your request can be
[15:46:51] <magcius> why can't I have a request body with 'GET'?
[15:47:21] <Trisox[work]> maak nie uit
[15:47:32] <xochilpili> Koen_, http://jsfiddle.net/XRRSF/12/
[15:47:44] <mrmccrac> does anyone know of jquery ui has css values for odd vs. even elements in say a table?
[15:48:13] <a_L_p> shishire: thanks! that worked..
[15:48:50] <Trisox> bed time cu 2morrow
[15:49:24] <ngharo> GoGoGarrett_: http://jsfiddle.net/jYK5q/6/
[15:49:32] <Koen_> mrmccrac: $('#table tr td:odd')
[15:49:35] <Koen_> :even
[15:49:50] <Koen_> -#
[15:50:01] <mrmccrac> Koen_: ok have you used them with the datatables plugin?
[15:50:13] <ngharo> GoGoGarrett_: if all you want to do is push text into the textarea, there's really no reason to write to an array first.  you could be writing to the textarea directly
[15:50:26] <mrmccrac> i guess i just give it them a class of odd/even..
[15:50:54] <Koen_> no plugins
[15:50:56] <Koen_> no
[15:50:58] <Koen_> its a selector
[15:51:07] <GoGoGarrett_> ngharo I understand, I was just trying to get some experience working with different concepts, but I didn't think of joining them.  Thanks for the help
[15:51:14] <Koen_> $('.rows:odd').addClass('oddstyle');
[15:51:15] <ngharo> GoGoGarrett_: cool np
[15:51:25] <mrmccrac> hmm
[15:51:37] <Koen_> i select all elements with class "rows"
[15:51:38] <xochilpili> i cant load datepicker stored in a html file : "datepicker.html" from $("#content").load("datepicker.html");
[15:51:39] <xochilpili> any hand ?
[15:51:46] <Koen_> get the odd ones, and add a new class to them
[15:51:51] <mrmccrac> i see
[15:52:03] <Koen_> xockilpili
[15:52:18] <Koen_> you should add the function that adds the datepicker(options) thing in the datepicker.html
[15:52:20] <Koen_> not in the main file
[15:52:53] <xochilpili> Koen_, i have the function in datepicker.html file... not in main.html
[15:53:11] <Koen_> hmmz
[15:53:34] <Koen_> maybe you have to remove the document).ready stuff
[15:53:53] <xochilpili> i removed it
[15:53:56] <Koen_> <script>$('....').datepicker(...);</script> only
[15:53:59] <quackquack> anyone know of a library that will validate form inputs based off of their type?
[15:54:12] <xochilpili> $(function() {$( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();});
[15:54:23] <Koen_> ditch function, see if it works then
[15:54:41] <xochilpili> ditch ? what is ditch: remove it ?
[15:54:41] <Koen_> <script>$( "irc://irc.freenode.net/#datepicker" ).datepicker();</script>
[15:54:49] <Koen_> yep
[15:55:54] <xochilpili> Koen_, is not working :
[15:55:56] <xochilpili> :(
[15:56:25] <Koen_> can you show me your script again
[15:56:31] <xochilpili> oks
[15:57:57] <xochilpili> http://fpaste.org/cjAO/
[15:58:08] <Koen_> thats the file you load ?
[15:58:15] <xochilpili> yes
[15:58:25] <xochilpili> i load it from another, called index.html
[15:58:28] <Koen_> ok
[15:58:30] <Koen_> strip all
[15:58:32] <Koen_> exept for
[15:58:33] <Koen_> <input type="text" id="datepicker">
[15:58:39] <Koen_> the put the script tags underneath them
[15:58:52] <Koen_> <input type="text" id="datepicker">
[15:58:54] <Koen_> <script type="text/javascript">
[15:58:54] <Koen_> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
[15:58:54] <Koen_> </script>
[15:58:58] <Koen_> thats all that remains
[15:59:04] <Koen_> all other stuff goes down the drain
[15:59:18] <Koen_> and in your main file (where you include it from), make sure jquery is laoded
[15:59:51] <xochilpili> sorry by my english like this : http://fpaste.org/HFak/ ?
[16:00:18] <Koen_> empty the file
[16:00:21] <Koen_> blank, new file
[16:00:23] <xochilpili> ok

[16:00:39] <Koen_> save it, done
[16:01:12] <xochilpili> ok
[16:01:21] <Koen_> the file where you do:  $("#content").load("datepicker.html");
[16:01:33] <Koen_> has to have: <script... jquery.js etc
[16:03:36] <xochilpili> Koen_, :(
[16:03:45] <Koen_> doesnt work ?

[16:11:57] <madprops> can i use an id to choose the parent container in scaleImage() ?
[16:12:19] <mantasm> Koen_:  thanks, but was wondering how to nicely integrate it into jquery_pjax plugin..
[16:12:45] <Koen_> i dont know pjax, sorry
[16:13:48] <Koen_> scaleImage? whats that
[16:14:48] <Koen_> $(this).closest('.someparentdiv');
[16:19:35] <ridethefire122> what is wrong with this:
[16:19:36] <ridethefire122> if ($(player).attr('rel') == '' && $(player).attr('target') != '_blank' )
[16:19:54] <ch3mical> Is player a variable?
[16:20:06] <Koen_> player.attr() maybe ?
[16:20:18] <ch3mical> Koen_: no
[16:20:34] <Koen_> looks fine to me then
[16:20:39] <Koen_> sure its on that line ?
[16:20:42] <Koen_> oh
[16:20:43] <Koen_> w7
[16:20:44] <Koen_> w8
[16:20:46] <ridethefire122> ch3mical: looks like it: var player = this;
[16:20:47] <ch3mical> I'm guessing player is a variable, but we don't know
[16:20:50] <kba> when I do $.post(url,function(data){alert('hello');},"json"); I get a popup, but if I use "html" instead of "json", nothing happens - how come?
[16:20:50] <Koen_> && => ||
[16:20:54] <Koen_> can never be true
[16:21:03] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: what does player actually equal
[16:21:07] <Koen_> oh its rel and target, sorry
[16:21:08] <jedimind_> Koen_, if you try just somewhat harder, you can successfuly chat on irc by doing one letter per line
[16:21:11] <jedimind_> because that's not fucking annoying at all
[16:21:36] <Koen_> im sorry dude, just using irc for the first time now
[16:22:16] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: my guess is that player doesn't point to a jquery object, try changing "this" to "$(this)" in that variable assignment
[16:22:18] <ridethefire122> btw, I just started learning jquery an hour ago, so bear with me.
[16:22:29] <jedimind_> im crabby, dont mind me, just be a little mindful of slapping enter
[16:22:43] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: no worries, we all start somewhere
[16:23:35] <ridethefire122> ch3mical sec
[16:23:49] <ch3mical> If only that guy's name was spelled Hairy
[16:23:50] <Koen_> i found my own behaviour annoying myself actually, i think its just a habit of me haha, sorry again
[16:24:12] <ch3mical> o_O Koen_
[16:24:31] <ridethefire122> ch3mical: this may shed some light: http://pastebin.com/014gEnNR
[16:25:16] <ridethefire122> also , for the record, I am trying to exclude anything with a target="_blank"
[16:25:50] <ch3mical> Sure
[16:26:07] <ch3mical> Let me know what it does when you assign the var player = $(this);
[16:26:16] <Koen_> $('a').not('[target=_blank]')   is that possible guys ?
[16:26:21] <ridethefire122> kk min
[16:26:41] <ch3mical> Koen_: bad syntax
[16:27:58] <Koen_> [target^=_blank]
[16:28:03] <ch3mical> Koen_: first of all, when you do attribute selectors, you should always quote the value string like $('[target="_blank"]') ... however in this case you should do it with the :not(selector) function
[16:28:09] <ch3mical> Koen_: see ?:not
[16:28:10] <bot-t> Koen_, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[16:28:33] <Koen_> is() then
[16:28:35] <Koen_> ?
[16:28:51] <Koen_> (removing enter key from keyboard)
[16:29:39] <kba> is there a way to see what's in my JSON object? Like convert it all to a string or similar for debugging?
[16:29:59] <xochilpili> Koen_, is that for is not working ?
[16:30:28] <Koen_> console.log(jsonobject)
[16:30:32] <d4rklit3> kba, for loop
[16:30:49] <d4rklit3> if you want to traverse the object completely make a recursive function
[16:30:53] <d4rklit3> and just let it run through
[16:31:20] <Koen_> get firebug extension for firefox or use chrome
[16:31:44] <xochilpili> i have it
[16:31:45] <xochilpili> Koen_,
[16:32:40] <kba> d4rklit3: well how do I access the elements without a name?
[16:32:55] <kba> Is there an iterator or something?
[16:33:17] <Koen_> kba, log the object to the console (chrome) or firebug (firefox)
[16:33:25] <dyjytyl> does anyone know if there exists a shortcut to inspect an element in Chrome when the developer window is already open, but inspect is not enabled? it's ctrl+shift+c in Firefox. doing this in chrome will close the developer window if it's open, not activate inspect element
[16:34:12] <kba> Koen_: oh thanks you
[16:34:12] <Koen_> rightmouse-inspect maybe, in firefox it is like that ?
[16:34:37] <dyjytyl> i was hoping for a keyboard shortcut, i saw rightmouse+inspect
[16:35:58] <djQuery1> hey
[16:36:02] <blindMoe> ho
[16:36:33] <dyjytyl> hey
[16:41:05] <shoe> tricky problem; looking for advice: I have a Tabs widget with a cookie for remembering the tab, but I'm also replacing the whole tabs div with another using $(oldElement).html(newContent).  The problem is that this triggers the destroy event on the tabs, which removes the cookie, so that when I init the new tabs widget it sees no cookie.
[16:42:40] <saimon69> have a page with a discrete long jquery script for a selection wizard, however at least the first time the page fails to work and has to be reloaded for the jquery to trigger properly; how can i fix this?
[16:43:26] <d4rklit3> kba?
[16:43:32] <eddiemonge> shoe: use live or delegate
[16:43:45] <d4rklit3> can't u just $("div")
[16:43:54] <d4rklit3> and taht should give u all the divs
[16:43:59] <eddiemonge> saimon69: long jquery script? you mean large in size?
[16:44:15] <saimon69> might say like one thousand of lines
[16:44:22] <saimon69> mostly switches and functions
[16:44:26] <shoe> it triggers the "remove" event, which triggers .destroy(), which removes the cookie
[16:44:55] <shoe> eddiemonge: I don't follow what you mean.
[16:45:22] <kba> d4rklit3: Yes?
[16:45:58] <goshawk> hi
[16:46:01] <saimon69> eddiemonge: AND is not the only script there, i also have three cufon fonts, a livevalidate, some other scripts that use for a drop down menu and login
[16:46:13] <eddiemonge> shoe: oh then thats different. dont add the destroy event then. find a different way to remove the cookie or dont remove it all
[16:46:18] <goshawk> from $(this) how can i get the tag that just follows ?
[16:46:31] <saimon69> i know is probably a lot of stuff, but would like to make it work 99% of the time not only 50%
[16:46:42] <eddiemonge> saimon69: whats the filesize?
[16:46:42] <d4rklit3> whats your issue kba
[16:46:59] <eddiemonge> goshawk: you mean like .next() or children() ?
[16:47:17] <goshawk> i think next() (i was googlign for it)
[16:47:18] <goshawk> thanks
[16:47:34] <shoe> eddiemonge: I don't want to remove the cookie at all, and I'm not adding the destroy event.  This is done by Widget._createWidget()
[16:48:07] <SkyFlyer> Anyone know a good way to make sure an image isn't cached?  I have a crop tool and try to show a preview, but since it's the same name it caches the old image and won't show the updated version of it cropped?
[16:48:28] <Koen_> image.jpg?t=randomstring
[16:48:28] <saimon69> the php page, including php scripts is 79k, the other scripts might range from 10 to 60k (jquery minified)
[16:48:31] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: any luck?
[16:48:43] <saimon69> eddiemonge: the php page, including php scripts is 79k, the other scripts might range from 10 to 60k (jquery minified)
[16:49:42] <saimon69> an overall of half meg of stuff i suppose
[16:49:47] <eddiemonge> shoe: then modify the cooke plugin
[16:50:03] <eddiemonge> SkyFlyer: add a query string param to it
[16:50:40] <eddiemonge> saimon69: have you looked into minimizing the scripts.....or getting rid of some of them?
[16:50:55] <ridethefire122> ch3mical sec
[16:51:12] <SkyFlyer> image.jpg?t=randomstring doesn't seem to work.  still shows the old image...
[16:51:24] <zulax> i need to pass id from a link, my thought is pass as "href", but is there a better way of passing parameter to onclick functions?
[16:51:26] <saimon69> well cannot get rid of them since are part of the design, btw firebug says: 48 requests - 503.8 KB (409.7 KB from cache)
[16:51:38] <SkyFlyer> if i click on the image and do VIEW IMAGE, it will show the updated image
[16:51:46] <Koen_> randomstring should be something like <?php echo rand(0,999); ?>
[16:51:59] <saimon69> and this tihng is continuously evolving so i cannot even minimize too much
[16:52:06] <eddiemonge> SkyFlyer: where are you setting the query string at?
[16:52:10] <SkyFlyer> it is.  I have this... ?time=<?php echo substr(0,10,md5(time()));?>">
[16:52:33] <Koen_> is it saved by the time you preview it ?
[16:52:37] <Koen_> if its for a crop
[16:52:42] <saimon69> beside minimizing/removing any suggestion?
[16:52:45] <SkyFlyer> hmm. good question!
[16:52:51] <Koen_> why dont you duplicate it, but scale it, and hide it within a div (overflow hidden)
[16:52:59] <SkyFlyer> let me put a delay on the crop.
[16:53:01] <eddiemonge> saimon69: doesnt matter if its continously evolving if minimize it for production only
[16:53:05] <SkyFlyer> or see about a call back
[16:53:18] <eddiemonge> saimon69: and you might want to look into script loaders. i bet you could optimize the scripts
[16:53:22] <Jonz> there are plenty of options for concatenating/minifying scripts
[16:53:34] <saimon69> well i made a test with jql but have same problems
[16:53:44] <eddiemonge> jql?
[16:53:57] <saimon69> is like the page does not trigger the document.ready
[16:54:09] <eddiemonge> saimon69: do you have any errors in the console?
[16:54:39] <saimon69> when it fails to load no, sometimes it seems it cannot trigger one of the scripts though because it failed jquery to start
[16:54:43] <saimon69> in other pages
[16:54:49] <ridethefire122> ch3mical: no dice
[16:54:55] <shoe> eddiemonge: well, the cookie plugin is just being told to destroy the cookie, so it's doing the right thing.  Do you mean I should modify jqueryui tabs?
[16:55:20] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: :(
[16:55:20] <shoe> eddiemonge: ... to not remove the cookie upon destroy?
[16:55:26] <eddiemonge> saimon69: live link?
[16:55:47] <saimon69> well is a restricted page
[16:55:54] <eddiemonge> shoe: no i mean change the behavior of the cookie so it isnt destroyed. but its hard to know what you are doing without code or even plugin names
[16:55:55] <Koen_> crop preview
[16:55:56] <Koen_> http://pastebin.com/4ncM9F35
[16:56:52] <SkyFlyer> anyone have a good tool for seeing errors from IE... all it says is "object expected" on line 23,234,432 which doesn't help?
[16:57:07] <saimon69> or you can sign up to see what i mean

[16:58:00] <shoe> eddiemonge: jquery-ui Tabs, with the jquery.cookie plugin.  http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#cookie
[16:58:30] <eddiemonge> SkyFlyer: use ie9s dev tools
[16:59:11] <SkyFlyer> I develop using FF and firebug, then I test in IE and all shit hits the fan. hate it!
[16:59:24] <shoe> eddiemonge: I'm not sure what you mean by the behavior of the cookie.
[16:59:57] <Curator> can anyone help me with this? i'm trying to get my logo to fade in and out after a series of things: http://pastebin.com/3UJKu2tN
[17:03:30] <Curator> the first fades work fine
[17:03:32] <dismist> curator: does it fade out immediately?
[17:03:32] <Curator> dismist it's currently set to display:none
[17:03:32] <Curator> so it's invisible, then i want it to fade in, then out, then in, etc.
[17:03:32] <Curator> it currently stays invisible
[17:03:32] <dismist> right
[17:03:32] <Curator> and isn't fading in
[17:03:32] <dismist> because delay doesnt work like that
[17:03:32] <dismist> you need a settimeout
[17:03:32] <Curator> a settimeout where?
[17:03:32] <Curator> the fades are callbacks of eachother
[17:03:32] <dismist> right
[17:03:32] <Koen_> $('document') = $(document)
[17:03:32] <Koen_> fadeloop => var fadeloop
[17:03:32] <Koen_> did you add delay as a plugin or something ?
[17:03:32] <dismist> delay is a jquery command
[17:03:32] <dismist> added in 1.4
[17:03:32] <dismist> function rather
[17:03:32] <Curator> right, why would i need it here though?
[17:03:32] <dismist> why do you have it therE?
[17:03:32] <Curator> oh
[17:03:32] <Curator> sorry
[17:03:32] <crankharder> are there any ideas about when UI1.9 will be finished?
[17:03:32] <Curator> that part works just fine
[17:03:32] <Curator> ignore that part, it's everything below it that doesn't work
[17:03:33] <Curator> the before and after fade in properly
[17:03:33] <dismist> you define fadeloop as a function but you never call it
[17:03:33] <Koen_> make fadeloop a seperate function
[17:03:33] <dismist> plus it would need to be var fadeloop=function
[17:03:33] <Curator> ok. i copied this off some forum i think
[17:03:53] <Curator> i want it to be an infinite loop though, so the function needs to call itself at the end
[17:06:55] <ridethefire122> ch3mical this works:
[17:06:56] <ridethefire122> if ($(player).attr('rel') == '' && $(player).attr('target') != '_blank') {
[17:06:56] <ridethefire122> $(player).attr('rel', this.href);
[17:07:06] <ridethefire122> well, it sorta work
[17:07:06] <ridethefire122> s
[17:07:42] <d4rklit3> anyone here work for rainbow media?
[17:07:51] <ridethefire122> for some reason, even if an <a> has target="_blank" it still proceeds with the if loop
[17:08:55] <d4rklit3> ok good
[17:08:56] <saimon69> eddiemonge: you there?
[17:08:59] <d4rklit3> cuz FUCK RAINBOW MEDIA
[17:09:03] <eddiemonge> yes
[17:09:25] <Curator> ok i fixed it, i was defining the function wrong lol
[17:09:29] <Curator> should've done function fadeLoop()
[17:10:31] <Koen_> console.log($(this).attr('target'))
[17:12:12] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: cool.. if you want the loop to stop, add a "return <some value>" to the positive result
[17:12:21] <d4rklit3> hi, im trying to find something like this,   var rss = $(iframe).contents().find(".nav-main-rss img");    in an iframe
[17:12:29] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: i.e. the code that is executed when "_blank" is found
[17:12:35] <d4rklit3> however .nav-main-rss is nested deep inside there, what would be the best way to find it?
[17:12:39] <ch3mical> ridethefire122: that should exit the loop
[17:13:02] <eddiemonge> saimon69: why are you using jquery 1.3.2?
[17:13:08] <ridethefire122> I FIXED IT
[17:13:11] <ridethefire122> I AM A GOLDEN GOD
[17:13:16] <Koen_> lol
[17:13:26] <saimon69> have compatibility problems lot oif scripts were done for it
[17:13:31] <goshawk> is there a way to show in the browser what is my $(this) ?
[17:13:37] <ridethefire122> seriously though, you bros are great
[17:13:44] <Koen_> console.log($(this))
[17:13:50] <goshawk> maybe highlighting it ( i was doing it in extjs)
[17:14:30] <d4rklit3> i was doing it right it was just a # instead of .
[17:15:32] <eddiemonge> saimon69: i would look at upgrading that first and then the plugins
[17:16:20] <saimon69> is known it gives problems?
[17:16:31] <eddiemonge> well its a couple of years old
[17:18:53] <saimon69> do i might need to refactor my scripts or can i leave it untouched?
[17:20:06] <eddiemonge> saimon69: depends on how they are written. if they are written correctly then they shouldnt break
[17:27:58] <goshawk> how can i cycle for any .next() item ?
[17:31:31] <eddiemonge> cycle?
[17:31:35] <sodapop> i made some button by adding class="ui-icon ui-icon-carat-1-w", when these buttons are placed in a dialog the bg image is wrong, any idea which class i have to remove ?
[17:32:17] <goshawk> eddiemonge, like a foreach... i'm in $(this) and i want to iterate all the $(this).next()
[17:32:34] <GoGoGarrett> ?.each
[17:32:34] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[17:35:45] <eddiemonge> sodapop: why not just do .button()?
[17:36:40] <goshawk> GoGoGarrett, thanks for the .each suggestion, but how do i use it to iterate over the .next() items of $(this) ?
[17:36:58] <eddiemonge> $(this).nextAll().each()
[17:37:05] <eddiemonge> ?nextall @ goshawk
[17:37:06] <bot-t> goshawk, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[17:37:20] <goshawk> perfect
[17:37:21] <goshawk> :D
[17:37:22] <goshawk> thanks
[17:39:02] <sodapop> eddiemonge, thats what i do
[17:39:16] <sodapop> and use the class to select the icon
[17:39:32] <sodapop> it shows ok outside the dialog
[17:41:29] <sodapop> background-position is ignored
[17:41:33] <SkyFlyer> so just downloaded ie 9.  It shows my error as a syntax error in the dev tools on line 5 of this line:  jQuery.noConflict();  ?
[17:42:33] <SkyFlyer> Its on the line right before I include Jquery
[17:43:38] <coldhead> does it go away if you include jQuery before that?
[17:44:05] <SkyFlyer> i mean the other way around obviously.  I include Jquery, then have no conflict
[17:44:43] <coldhead> are you sure jQuery is being included?
[17:44:49] <coldhead> it's not 404ing or something?
[17:45:25] <coldhead> what do you see if you enter jQuery.fn.jquery at the console?
[17:47:12] <SkyFlyer> strange, I included the UI before no conflict. now no error?
[17:52:37] <magcius> why can't I do $([ $("#foo"), $("#bar") ]).hide()?
[17:52:59] <coldhead> because $() is not expecting an array
[17:53:11] <magcius> OK.
[17:53:18] <magcius> What else can I do besides $("#foo, #bar")
[17:53:37] <coldhead> ?add @ magcius
[17:53:37] <bot-t> magcius, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[17:54:00] <coldhead> $($('#foo')).add($('#bar'))
[17:54:15] <coldhead> but just "#foo, #bar", what is wrong with that?
[17:55:48] <coldhead> BERGAMOT
[17:56:08] <magcius> OK.
[17:56:21] <magcius> http://fpaste.org/RTJA/ -- this is what my code looks like right now
[17:56:27] <magcius> if there's a better way to do these shenanigans, let me know
[17:57:33] <coldhead> enable.add(disable).hide()
[17:58:47] <magcius> an array should be perfect for this though
[17:58:59] <zulax> is this not right? var obj = JSON.parse(data);
[17:59:02] <coldhead> enable.hide(); disable.hide(); is probably more efficient
[17:59:14] <zulax> i get data from a php script(json_encoded)
[17:59:37] <magcius> coldhead, well, I could also do $.each([install, disable, enable), $.fn.each); right?
[17:59:40] <magcius> er
[17:59:46] <coldhead> magcius: i imagine jQuery doesn't support arrays because that $() can handle enough alternatives already. having to test for an array and then determine the type of each element would be sloow
[17:59:48] <magcius> coldhead, well, I could also do $.each([install, disable, enable), $.fn.hide); right?
[18:00:11] <magcius> $.each([install, disable, enable], $.fn.hide); dammit
[18:00:18] <coldhead> you COULD do something like that
[18:00:24] <coldhead> but it's not super readable
[18:00:50] <ryanneufeld> zulax: are you getting that with a $.getJSON ?
[18:01:23] <zulax> ryanneufeld, no, from ajax success : function(data)
[18:01:28] <zulax> and datatype = json
[18:01:40] <ryanneufeld> then just use data
[18:01:49] <ryanneufeld> it'll be an object
[18:01:53] <zulax> ok
[18:01:54] <dlam> what's the thing that centers the browser on an selected element?   is it focus() or something?
[18:09:47] <zulax> ryanneufeld, if i alert data[0] it gives object Object, but if data[1] then undefined
[18:10:09] <zulax> the php code is echo json_encode($array)
[18:10:31] <ryanneufeld> I got that part
[18:10:37] <ryanneufeld> what does console.log(data)
[18:10:42] <zulax> i will see
[18:10:51] <squeee> Within a click handler for input[type=submit][name=foo][value=bar], I have event.preventDefault(), followed by a form.submit(). How can I have it so the foo parameter is sent in the post request on the form submit? http://jsfiddle.net/h9YGz/5/
[18:10:59] <madprops> is there a scale image plugin  already available in jq 1.5.1?
[18:11:32] <zulax> where does console actually wirte to? how do i see it?
[18:11:54] <ryanneufeld> you use firefox?
[18:11:59] <ryanseddon> to the console in the dev tools, depends what browser you're using
[18:12:07] <ryanneufeld> getfirebug.com
[18:12:18] <zulax> ok, got it
[18:12:28] <zulax> [Object { id="2491", title="tiele", track="4"}]
[18:15:32] <ryanneufeld> so you have an array with one item
[18:15:37] <ryanneufeld> that is an object
[18:15:47] <ryanneufeld> so there is no [1] index
[18:16:20] <zulax> but [0] doesnt give anything either
[18:16:37] <madprops> when loading a plugin do i have to include both the min.js and the .js ?
[18:17:06] <ryanseddon> no
[18:17:21] <ryanseddon> min is the minified version of the full script
[18:19:53] <madprops> ryanseddon, so i could just use one of them?
[18:20:26] <ryanseddon> use the min it's the production version you should use
[18:20:37] <ryanneufeld> zulax: can you do console.log(data.id) ?
[18:21:29] <dyjytyl> are ruby hashes mutable? if so how do i add another key/val pair to an existing hash
[18:21:31] <dyjytyl> woops wrong room
[18:23:43] <zulax> ryanneufeld, after the first time, i now dont see log on console
[18:23:47] <zulax> dont know what i did
[18:24:14] <zulax> got it,
[18:24:20] <zulax> undefine ryanneufeld
[18:24:30] <ryanneufeld> hm
[18:25:03] <zulax> [21:24:45.585] [{id:"2491", title:"tiele", track:"4"}]
[18:25:16] <ryanneufeld> that's what you get now?
[18:25:25] <zulax> thats the entire data
[18:25:28] <ryanneufeld> try console.dir(data)
[18:27:21] <zulax> i dont think its showing anything now
[18:28:36] <zulax> ryanneufeld, got it!!! data[0].id
[18:28:41] <ryanneufeld> There you go
[18:28:42] <zulax> thanks for helping out
[18:28:52] <ryanneufeld> so looks like you're getting an array of objects
[18:29:00] <zulax> ya
[18:29:02] <ryanneufeld> cool
[18:29:03] <zulax> its got []
[18:29:14] <zulax> this is my first time ever with json
[18:29:17] <ryanneufeld> hm
[18:29:22] <ryanneufeld> thats what she said?
[18:29:35] <ryanneufeld> any how
[18:29:36] <zulax> :)
[18:29:40] <ryanneufeld> I gotta run
[18:29:45] <ryanneufeld> glad you got it figured out.
[18:29:58] <macabre> has anyone used colorbox in the past? im having an issue when i close the pop up, the overlay does not remove itself from the page - leaving me with a grey background
[18:36:29] <DeltaBurnt> Is there a reason why this doesn't work: "$('input').blur(function() { $(this).focus(); });"
[18:47:56] <versatiletech> DeltaBurnt: try http://jsbin.com/ejoze5
[18:49:01] <DeltaBurnt> versatiletech: It shows the dialog, but doesn't refocus
[18:49:38] <DeltaBurnt> Oh wait you aren't focusing in that code
[18:49:53] <versatiletech> yeah
[18:49:55] <versatiletech> hehe
[18:50:07] <DeltaBurnt> Well the alert is empty
[18:50:19] <DeltaBurnt> I mean I've gotten the blur event to fire, that's for sure
[18:50:24] <DeltaBurnt> But it never wants to refocus
[18:50:49] <versatiletech> ok, what is it that you're trying to achieve
[18:51:05] <versatiletech> give me some context
[18:51:49] <DeltaBurnt> Well I'm trying to make a javascript game for the 3DS/PSP browser in which javascript can detect the key presses of the dpad (because it's the same as the arrow keys) and the a/x buttons (because they have the same key code as enter)
[18:52:03] <DeltaBurnt> But I'm trying to use b/o which blur your current element
[18:52:23] <DeltaBurnt> So if it detects a blur it knows you pressed b(3DS) or o(PSP), then refocuses
[18:52:53] <DeltaBurnt> It was really more or less an experiment, but it bugged me how I couldn't get something so simple working
[18:53:06] <versatiletech> DeltaBurnt: is it a problem in all browsers or just in the 3DS/PSP browser?
[18:53:41] <DeltaBurnt> I'm testing it in firefox right now
[18:53:48] <DeltaBurnt> I haven't even tried it in those browsers
[18:54:04] <DeltaBurnt> I mean I figured if it didn't work in firefox it wouldn't work in those browsers
[18:54:16] <versatiletech> yeah, I wouldn't be surprised of the javascript for those mobile devices are severely limited and buggy
[18:54:24] <versatiletech> if the*
[18:54:49] <DeltaBurnt> Yah
[18:54:59] <DeltaBurnt> No HTML5 support beyond canvas either
[18:55:32] <versatiletech> yeah, that's a good approach. Now do you have any kind of documentation for those browsers?
[18:56:19] <DeltaBurnt> They both use NetFront
[18:56:49] <DeltaBurnt> But the problem isn't even with those browsers right now, it's with this simple javascript that should work :\
[18:59:28] <versatiletech> many times "should work" turns into implementing some stupid workaround for something that doesn't work how "it should
[19:00:18] <DeltaBurnt> Ok well you do have any suggestions for a workaround?
[19:05:03] <sodapop> is it possible to make an ajax call to https
[19:05:23] <sodapop> if i have my server serving both http and https
[19:06:30] <versatiletech> well first thing I would do is to rule out if the javascript engine is not compliant. Try this code, type in something into the input box and then lose focus.
[19:06:31] <versatiletech> http://jsbin.com/ejoze5/2
[19:07:47] <DeltaBurnt> You want me to test this on the handheld's browser?
[19:07:53] <versatiletech> yes
[19:10:14] <DeltaBurnt> It alerts what I typed in correctly
[19:10:28] <coldhead> sodapop: only https pages can ajax to https pages
[19:10:31] <versatiletech> ok good
[19:10:32] <coldhead> and ditto for http
[19:10:47] <coldhead> the domain and the protocol and the port have got to match
[19:12:43] <sodapop> coldhead, then e.g. an ajax login is doomed unless you serve the entire site under https
[19:12:51] <coldhead> yes
[19:12:54] <sodapop> ...
[19:13:16] <ryanseddon> or in an iframe under https or is that still insecure?
[19:13:16] <coldhead> well maybe you could put the login form in an iframe and load it via https
[19:13:22] <coldhead> but look don't get stroppy, it isn't my fault
[19:13:33] <coldhead> i never wanted https in the first place
[19:13:38] <sodapop> i don't just asking
[19:13:39] <sodapop> :)
[19:13:41] <coldhead> i was like "can't we all just trust each other"
[19:13:46] <coldhead> but nooo
[19:13:48] <coldhead> NOOOOOOO
[19:14:02] <ryanseddon> like people trusted citibank?
[19:14:12] <coldhead> I STILL TRUST CITIBANK
[19:14:19] <coldhead> they need it now, more than ever
[19:14:20] <sodapop> so how can you secure a request with no https
[19:14:24] <sodapop> any idea
[19:14:31] <ryanseddon> client side crypto
[19:14:33] <coldhead> ryan's iframe idea
[19:14:43] <coldhead> or lol blowfish in js
[19:14:48] <coldhead> something like that
[19:14:54] <ryanseddon> which right now is a myth
[19:15:06] <ryanseddon> but chrome has the crypto object
[19:16:34] <coldhead> you have to use https for secure requests
[19:16:37] <coldhead> that's what it's for
[19:17:21] <sodapop> i agree
[19:17:29] <ryanseddon> yes, but in the future you could client side encrypt data and the transport wouldn't matter
[19:17:37] <sodapop> but imagine you use it for login then you exchange a key or something
[19:17:45] <sodapop> so basically it becomes the whole site
[19:17:46] <DeltaBurnt> versatiletech: You still there?
[19:17:54] <versatiletech> yep
[19:18:11] <coldhead> that will be a wonderful new world of poorly implemented encryption
[19:18:24] <DeltaBurnt> Did you see that I said the alert echoes my input correctly?
[19:18:29] <ryanseddon> browser already have internal crypto support it's a matter of exposing it
[19:18:32] <coldhead> sodapop: you can do the login on an https page
[19:18:38] <coldhead> then return to the regular site
[19:18:43] <coldhead> lots of places do that
[19:19:03] <sodapop> pages are mixed data when you are logged in they fill with personal data also
[19:19:49] <sodapop> did not think about it when i started
[19:19:50] <sodapop> :)
[19:20:33] <coldhead> IE 4000 is pleased to announce it has finally released internal encryption support
[19:20:56] <coldhead> IE 4001 is pleased to announce it has fixed the vulnerabilities in it's intneral encryption support
[19:20:58] <sodapop> haha it will read your eyeball
[19:21:06] <coldhead> IE 4002 All the vulnerabilities
[19:22:09] <coldhead> i can just imagine they will send ciphertext and plaintext together so as to be backwards compatible with servers that don't have decryption
[19:23:12] <sodapop> loads of stuff here though http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/encryption
[19:24:00] <versatiletech> DeltaBurnt: try this http://jsbin.com/ejoze5/4/
[19:24:19] <coldhead> I SEE THE STREET LIGHTS AS FAIR GROUNDS
[19:24:40] * balr0g hello.
[19:26:04] <sodapop> or you can have a button like "switch to secure mode", will that be lame?
[19:26:33] <miketaylr> hahaha why do any of these jquery encryption plugins exist?
[19:28:06] <miketaylr> if anyone sees tony simek, tell him i'm coming after him: http://0061276.netsolhost.com/tony/javascript/jquery.rc4.js
[19:30:14] <DeltaBurnt> versatiletech: Actually it appears to be working in the 3DS browser but not Firefox
[19:31:07] <versatiletech> well you're only worried about making it work on the 3DS right?
[19:31:12] <versatiletech> and of course the PSP
[19:31:23] <DeltaBurnt> Yah
[19:32:02] <DeltaBurnt> I guess the more used browsers have some sort of protection against refocussing or something similar?
[19:32:34] <versatiletech> it's just a fact that many browsers behave differently in terms of javascript
[19:32:52] <DeltaBurnt> Yah
[19:33:05] <DeltaBurnt> Which is one of the reasons why I hate working with it :\
[19:33:21] <miketaylr> DeltaBurnt: do you know what the UA string is of the 3DS browser?
[19:33:26] * miketaylr is curious
[19:34:08] <miketaylr> alert(navigator.userAgent)
[19:34:32] <DeltaBurnt> Let me check real quick
[19:34:55] <versatiletech> so if you want to accommodate many browsers you'll have to create code that works on those browsers and do a crap load of regression testing (testing to see if everything works after making a change to the code)
[19:35:23] <DeltaBurnt> So much fun
[19:36:35] <versatiletech> yep, welcome to front-end development
[19:36:50] <DeltaBurnt> <3 php
[19:37:43] <versatiletech> yep, pretty much agnostic to the browser. I love PHP too. Zend certified woot woot!!

[19:38:05] <miketaylr> DeltaBurnt: thanks!
[19:38:14] <miketaylr> i wonder who made it
[19:38:19] <DeltaBurnt> It'll change if you use a different region probably
[19:38:23] <DeltaBurnt> Like a Japanese 3DS
[19:38:25] <miketaylr> Opera did the DSI one, but the 3DS isn't opera
[19:38:32] <DeltaBurnt> it's NetFront
[19:38:41] <DeltaBurnt> The same thing used for the PSP/PS3 browsers
[19:39:16] <miketaylr> ahh
[19:39:37] <miketaylr> thanks DeltaBurnt
[19:39:49] <DeltaBurnt> No problem
[20:07:19] <enherit> what does the "@@" mean in the Makefile?
[20:07:44] <keyo> jquery seems to be ignoring my .delay()
[20:07:44] <keyo> $('#diagnostics_loader').show().delay(5000).hide();
[20:09:48] <kba> keyo: if you read just the first paragraph in the API, you'd know why
[20:10:28] <ScottyBoy> Now I have to go look, cause I'm curious. :P
[20:11:14] <keyo> kba: Really didn't expect that it wouldn't work on show/hide. Should have RTFM though
[20:11:34] <kba> indeed :)
[20:12:10] <keyo> So if I did animate({'display':'none'}) or something, that would use the event queue
[20:12:38] <kba> I'd assume, but there's an easy way to know :)
[20:13:28] <kba> in the examples they use fadeIn(400), so using that would be the obvious choice
[20:14:31] <ScottyBoy> What would I use if I wanted to add a whole function after the delay? Is that even possible?
[20:15:37] <kba> ScottyBoy: if you had read the API as well, you'd know there's a callback argument ;-)
[20:16:40] <ScottyBoy> Oi. n00bie FTL. apparently this isn't my specialty. LOL
[20:17:43] <kba> http://jsfiddle.net/9NQa3/
[20:18:13] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I suppose
[20:19:47] <ScottyBoy> That's interesting.... Why put the function inside the fadeout?
[20:20:21] <ryanneufeld> whoops ww
[20:20:23] <kba> It's a callback, ScottyBoy - it tells jQuery that when it's done with whatever it's doing, it should execute that function
[20:20:48] <ScottyBoy> Hmm... Umkay, lemme try it. Sorry for my ignorance. :P
[20:20:52] <kba> there's an optional callback parameter on a lot of fmethods
[20:21:59] <ryanneufeld> most of the animations have optional callbacks
[20:24:52] <ScottyBoy> So what if I don't want it to fade out? LOL I can't use my dropdown menu if it goes away. ;)
[20:25:29] <jsaxey> anyone here familiar with how jQuery UI's Autocomplete efficiently monitors typing? I'm guessing it's not monitoring the "keyup" event? anyone know?
[20:25:34] <kba> ScottyBoy: just remove the fadeOut() method - and the delay as well, since it's pretty useless then
[20:26:01] <ryanneufeld> jsaxey: look at the code in github
[20:27:09] <jsaxey> ryanneufeld: i tried looking through jQuery UI's source. i can't find anything that references "autocomplete" and I followed the code through in Chrome's web developer tools but I couldn't find where it was monitoring what the user types
[20:28:14] <Shai-Tan> The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless.
[20:28:18] <ryanneufeld> jsaxey: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js
[20:28:27] <Shai-Tan> why do I get this error?
[20:29:00] <jsaxey> ryanneufeld: thanks! that's more helpful. i'll check that out
[20:29:03] <fogus> how can I do a multiple level selector like this: select the <a> that is class .active that is sub of an <li> that is sub of a <ul> that is class menu?
[20:29:09] <ryanneufeld> jsaxey: np
[20:29:21] <ryanneufeld> Shai-Tan: what error?
[20:29:30] <fogus> maybe even further, say that <ul> was sub of a div that was class "content"
[20:29:41] <Shai-Tan> ryanneufeld: The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless.
[20:29:59] <ryanneufeld> fogus: $('ul.menu').find('a.active');
[20:30:00] <Shai-Tan> I have a text box, and have a keyup event, I get this errror
[20:30:00] <fogus> because I'm looking at http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp and I'm not seeing how to do multiple level selectors like that
[20:30:06] <fogus> ahh
[20:30:22] <ryanneufeld> fogus: DO NOT RELY ON W3SCHOOLS
[20:30:25] <ryanneufeld> sorr
[20:30:27] <ryanneufeld> *sorry
[20:30:32] <ryanneufeld> don't trust w3schools
[20:30:37] <ryanneufeld> api.jquery.com
[20:30:38] <fogus> are they wrong?
[20:30:46] <ryanneufeld> w3fools.com
[20:30:54] <fogus> lol XD
[20:30:55] <ryanneufeld> Shai-Tan: I need a code sample
[20:31:17] <ryanneufeld> ?p @Shai-Tan
[20:31:17] <bot-t> Shai-Tan, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:31:59] <fogus> ryanneufeld: is there a limit to that "find"?  will it only go one level down or will it go all the way to the deepness?
[20:33:50] <fogus> it appears... limitless!
[20:33:59] <fogus> time for some mead
[20:34:03] <ryanneufeld> lol
[20:34:13] <fogus> you too can brew
[20:34:21] <ryanneufeld> ?p fogus
[20:34:21] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[20:34:38] <ryanneufeld> if you can show me what you're trying to do
[20:34:40] <ryanneufeld> I can better help you
[20:34:52] <fogus> ok.  I did get it working (because it is limitless)
[20:35:22] <xcaliberse> hi. anybody here?
[20:35:22] <fogus> http://jsfiddle.net/Q9ACj/
[20:35:30] <fogus> xcaliberse: I'm here.  want some mead?
[20:35:44] <xcaliberse> mead?
[20:36:01] <Shai-Tan> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/p6LCw/
[20:36:07] <xcaliberse> i would like some help with my code
[20:36:17] <fogus> oh.
[20:36:25] <fogus> I forgot to put it in the fridge
[20:37:06] <ryanneufeld> fogus: can you add some HTML so I can see what you're working agains
[20:37:39] <fogus> ok. sure
[20:37:52] <ryanneufeld> Shai-Tan: what browser are you using that you're getting that error?
[20:38:22] <Shai-Tan> ryanneufeld: firefox
[20:38:25] <fogus> http://jsfiddle.net/Q9ACj/1/
[20:38:34] <xcaliberse> can someone take a look at this please. it might j ust be a technical error: http://jsfiddle.net/KvZQq/2/
[20:38:55] <ryanneufeld> Shai-Tan: do you have a public site where I can see this code?
[20:38:57] <fogus> it works pretty good now
[20:38:59] <ryanneufeld> in action
[20:39:16] <Shai-Tan> ryanneufeld: nossir, the error appears in firebug
[20:39:22] <xcaliberse> is anybody looking at my code? lol
[20:39:32] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: you just posted it
[20:39:41] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at two others right now
[20:39:45] <xcaliberse> oh okay
[20:39:47] <fogus> ryanneufeld: there was this weird thing where another menu with an "active" class that my JS was grabbing instead of what I wanted
[20:39:48] <ryanneufeld> gimme a few and I'll see what I can do :p
[20:39:49] <xcaliberse> let me know when it's my turn :D
[20:39:53] <fogus> I guess it will have to be lager tonight
[20:40:14] <ryanneufeld> fogus: so you got it figured out?
[20:40:26] <fogus> ryanneufeld: hehe, I aleady said so twice
[20:40:40] <fogus> I don't know why you're so intent to help, but I APPRECIATE it
[20:41:00] <fogus> cheers, dude
[20:41:14] <fogus> your first suggestion works because it digs so far down
[20:41:21] <fogus> all the way :)
[20:41:41] <fogus> ryanneufeld: this paste bin is really cool, dude
[20:41:55] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[20:41:59] <ryanneufeld> I wish I wrote it
[20:42:07] <ryanneufeld> Shai-Tan: http://jsfiddle.net/p6LCw/1/ seems fine in firebug to me
[20:42:57] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: your turn
[20:43:04] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: what am I looking at?
[20:43:05] <xcaliberse> sweet :D
[20:43:07] <xcaliberse> http://jsfiddle.net/KvZQq/2/
[20:43:19] <ryanneufeld> what should it do that it's not
[20:43:25] <ryanneufeld> what it's doing that it shouldn't?
[20:43:34] <xcaliberse> so the problem is, when the .question_submit button appears, nothing happens when i click it
[20:43:42] <xcaliberse> it's SUPPOSED to alert(i);
[20:44:14] <ryanneufeld> for starters
[20:44:24] <ryanneufeld> everyone STOP USING ALERT
[20:44:26] <ryanneufeld> </rant>
[20:44:29] <ryanneufeld> use console.log
[20:44:29] <xcaliberse> haha
[20:44:33] <ngharo> alert('STOP USING ALERT!!')
[20:44:34] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: Problem one
[20:44:40] <ryanneufeld> ngharo: lol
[20:44:53] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: problem one is that you didn't have jquery even loaded
[20:44:54] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/KvZQq/3/
[20:45:19] <xcaliberse> oh i do
[20:45:25] <xcaliberse> http://cloudclass.snsdcentral.net/create_quiz.php
[20:45:28] <ryanneufeld> not on the one you showed me
[20:45:29] <xcaliberse> here's the page
[20:45:31] <xcaliberse> :P
[20:45:36] <ryanneufeld> that's fine
[20:45:44] <ryanneufeld> I still see another problem
[20:45:47] <xcaliberse> i just wanted to show you what i thought u needed
[20:46:38] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: sure
[20:46:43] <ryanneufeld> lemme axe you a question
[20:46:50] <ryanneufeld> do you have firebug?
[20:46:53] <xcaliberse> yep
[20:46:59] <ryanneufeld> do you have it open right now?
[20:47:01] <xcaliberse> i use that and the javascript console on chrome
[20:47:02] <xcaliberse> yep
[20:47:23] <xcaliberse> im new at jquery.  been only 2 weeks.
[20:47:34] <ryanneufeld> $('.question_submit').button
[20:47:37] <ryanneufeld> is not a function
[20:47:43] <ryanneufeld> is the error I'm seeing on the fiddle
[20:47:59] <xcaliberse> hmm
[20:48:08] <xcaliberse> but on the real page, the .button() runs fine
[20:48:28] <ryanneufeld> OOOOHHHH
[20:48:38] <ryanneufeld> are you using a form plugin to make pretty buttons?
[20:48:40] <ngharo> fiddle needs jqui
[20:48:46] <ryanneufeld> has it
[20:48:46] <xcaliberse> jquery ui yes
[20:48:56] <ryanneufeld> ngharo: choose jquery(edge)
[20:49:14] <ngharo> i mean, his fiddle needs it enabled
[20:49:18] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: then you probably need to be binding a click function differently
[20:49:19] <ryanneufeld> oh
[20:49:20] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[20:49:21] <ryanneufeld> good call
[20:49:42] <xcaliberse> what do u mean?
[20:50:33] <xcaliberse> test the code here: http://cloudclass.snsdcentral.net/create_quiz.php
[20:50:40] <ryanneufeld> I see what you mean
[20:50:44] <ryanneufeld> but the first button is fine
[20:50:46] <xcaliberse> yep
[20:50:49] <xcaliberse> the 2nd button isn't lol
[20:50:51] <ryanneufeld> but you're dynamically adding the rest
[20:50:55] <xcaliberse> right
[20:50:57] <ryanneufeld> so you need either .live()
[20:51:11] <ryanneufeld> or, you can set a handler using the jqui button
[20:51:49] <ryanneufeld> k, there is no click handler from jqui
[20:51:50] <ryanneufeld> fuck
[20:51:53] <xcaliberse> hehe
[20:51:55] <ryanneufeld> well, then
[20:51:56] <SkyFlyer>  I love Beer... BEER BEER BEER!!!
[20:51:59] <ryanneufeld> gimme a sec
[20:52:01] <xcaliberse> mkay
[20:52:06] <xcaliberse> i appreciate your time btw :D
[20:52:18] <xcaliberse> excuse my dumb questions because im really new to jquery
[20:52:24] <SkyFlyer> no more jQuery... or...  jQuery('#myroom').drink().beer('lager');
[20:52:26] <abjorn> coldhead: can you tell me what bloomsday is? Cause I have no idea
[20:53:18] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: http://jsfiddle.net/KvZQq/5/ there you go
[20:53:38] <ryanneufeld> you need to do .live('click',function() instead of .click(function
[20:53:39] <Razor2> Hey room. Is anyone apart of the #PHP channel
[20:53:51] <ryanneufeld> i'm in ##php
[20:53:57] <xcaliberse> oooh
[20:54:03] <xcaliberse> lemme try
[20:54:07] <coldhead> abjorn: it is a literary holiday celebrating james joyce's novel ulysses which is set on this day in 1904
[20:54:52] <coldhead> ?w bloomsday
[20:54:53] <abjorn> o word
[20:54:54] <bot-t1> coldhead, Bloomsday - Bloomsday is a commemoration observed annually on June 16th in Dublin and elsewhere to celebrate the life of Irish writer James Joyce and relive the events in his novel Ulysses, all of which took place on the same day in Dublin in 1904. Joyce chose the date because his first outing with his wife-to-be, Nora Barnacle happened on that day, when they walked to the Dublin urban vill... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday
[20:55:19] <ryanneufeld> xcaliberse: I think you can use delegate() as well
[20:55:28] <xcaliberse> ahh there we go!
[20:55:32] <xcaliberse> thanks man
[20:55:34] <xcaliberse> delegate?
[20:55:37] <xcaliberse> is that the same thing as .live?
[20:55:43] <ryanneufeld> sortof
[20:55:51] <xcaliberse> heh cool
[20:56:03] <ryanneufeld> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-the-difference-between-live-and-delegate/
[20:56:49] <xcaliberse> ahh i see
[20:57:01] <xcaliberse> cool
[20:57:03] <xcaliberse> very informative
[20:57:05] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna watch that again myself
[20:57:11] <ryanneufeld> I keep forgetting
[20:57:19] <xcaliberse> haha
[20:57:22] <ryanneufeld> and I have a feeling I'm using live when I should use delegate :p
[20:57:24] <ryanneufeld> but now you know
[20:57:27] <ryanneufeld> so you can make the right call
[20:57:28] <xcaliberse> yep :P
[20:57:32] <xcaliberse> thx
[20:57:42] <t2gs> hey, what are you guys doing for mobile?
[20:58:04] <xcaliberse> nothing.

[21:14:21] <ryanneufeld> took me 1.5 weeks
[21:14:37] <t2gs> you did metrolyrics?
[21:15:01] <ryanneufeld> I've done about 50% of the php you see
[21:15:09] <ryanneufeld> and a lot more of the js
[21:15:23] <ryanneufeld> the mobile version was all me on the php and js
[21:15:28] <ryanneufeld> well mostly me on the php
[21:15:42] <ryanneufeld> our front end dev speaks some php
[21:15:46] <ryanneufeld> but the js was all me
[21:15:49] <t2gs> cool I used metrolyrics like ages ago when I was learning english and I couldn't understand what was sung lol

[22:20:08] <ruby_on_tails> hi
[22:30:51] <ryanneufeld> hi
[22:34:09] <bobbobbins> hey all, my code is becoming a total mess, could someone look at it and give me some pointers to clean it up, i have no idea what im doing: http://jsfiddle.net/ndszu/
[22:34:38] <bobbobbins> also, you can see i have a variable called settings...i want to pass that to my methods, but i can't seem to do that
[22:35:10] <bobbobbins> basically this thing reads in data from a php script, and displays it either in a table or as a graph
[22:36:59] <ruby_on_tails> i have a a draggable connected to some sortables, not these sortables are themselves sortable(nested stuff), when a sortable is moved up/down the dragaable doesnt work and cant deposit a LI in the sortable, but if the sortable is brought back to the original position it works, what can be the reason ?
[22:46:08] <ruby_on_tails> anyone alive ?
[22:46:14] <Mrfloyd> hello
[22:46:18] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[22:46:33] <Mrfloyd> sup
[22:46:34] <Mrfloyd> ?
[22:46:48] <Mrfloyd> does the live event works with phonegap
[22:46:49] <Mrfloyd> ?
[22:46:53] <ruby_on_tails> no idea
[22:48:58] <Mrfloyd> have u ever used live
[22:49:02] <Mrfloyd> it is like bind
[22:49:02] <Mrfloyd> ?
[22:54:59] <Aciid> hey could some enlighten me, on how to combine these two http://pastebin.com/HfaSeYV8
[23:12:17] <tomato> hi
[23:50:05] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[23:50:39] <Double_Rainbow> <input type="radio"  name="type" id="type" value="Appartement"> Appartement</div> i have an input like this
[23:50:48] <Double_Rainbow> i want that when the user clicks on it
[23:51:04] <Double_Rainbow> i makes another div display: none
[23:51:17] <Double_Rainbow> however, i cannot use id=type
[23:51:36] <Double_Rainbow> since its a radio button
[23:51:49] <Double_Rainbow> and there is another radio button with the same id
[23:51:53] <Double_Rainbow> so....
[23:53:19] <Solidem> the radiobuttons should not have the same ids
[23:53:24] <Solidem> but the same name=""
[23:53:29] <Double_Rainbow> but but how come?
[23:53:30] <Solidem> a ID is always unique
[23:53:50] <Double_Rainbow> i need to do $_POST['type'] on them
[23:54:01] <Double_Rainbow> so they NEED to be the same id
[23:54:46] <bobslaede> Hey. Event.charCode seems to always be 0, while .keyCode and .which is the same? Im trying to capture the letters pressed, but numpad numbers arent numbers, but letters.
[23:56:44] <Solidem> haven't worked with php for ages but try it, using hte same name but unique id's. $_POST['nam'] works?
[23:56:51] <Solidem> nam = name oc.
[23:57:35] <Double_Rainbow> ah
