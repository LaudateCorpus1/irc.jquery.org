[01:43:28] <Rockwood> hi
[01:43:34] <Rockwood> any awaken?
[04:07:17] <dimi1947> <robertmaxrees> what do you suggest?
[04:20:00] <dimi1947> as I understand you can do  an ajax request with both with $ajax and $get
[04:20:09] <dimi1947> is that correct?
[04:29:36] <pavonia> Yes, get() is a specialized version of ajax()
[04:39:11] <Cork> well it is more of a wrapper (one liner)
[04:40:34] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L846
[04:40:54] <Cork> has grone a little more then what i remembered, but still just a wrapper
[04:41:25] <Cork> (getJSON and getScript is basically the same)
[05:05:09] <dimi1947> Cork:what do you mean is a wrapper?
[05:05:17] <Cork> dimi1947: read the link
[05:05:25] <Cork> it would make it very obvious
[05:09:50] <dimi1947> I suppose what get does is made obvious from line 857
[05:10:00] <dimi1947> ...onwards
[05:11:02] <Cork> yup, it basically maps arguments to values in an object and calls $.ajax()
[05:11:07] <Cork> aka, a wrapper
[05:11:24] <Cork> same with line 838, and 842 in the same file
[05:11:54] <Cork> (where the wrapper is a wrapper around a wrapper)
[05:13:42] <dimi1947> now I am ggetting it...I come to ebserv though that the number of options being passed to get is limited in relation with ajax
[05:15:34] <Cork> ya, cause it isn't meant to make all of ajax possible, cause ya, that is $.ajax
[05:16:08] <Cork> but personally i never use $.get or $.post i find $.ajax(url, { method: 'get' }) simple enough
[05:16:18] <Cork> and makes it much eacher to expand it later
[05:17:35] <dimi1947> ...so you can use ajax too if you want to load data from the server...get is just there for convenience
[05:18:35] <Cork> yes
[05:19:01] <Cork> same as $().click(func) => $().on('click', func)
[05:19:33] <Cork> (though it used to be $().click(func) => $().bind('click', func))
[05:32:13] <dimi1947> I suppose when you use get async defaults to true...correct?
[05:32:52] <Cork> xhr by definition is async
[05:33:13] <Cork> unless you put it onto legacy mode where you can make it in some cases run syncronusly
[05:33:32] <Cork> (but really, REALLY shouldn't)
[05:35:59] <dimi1947> if with $.ajax you can adjust by will or options what is the use of ajaxPrefilter then...that I do not understand
[05:38:14] <Cork> prefilters is things like setting data: { p: 1, b: 'abc' } omstead pf data: "?p=1&b=abc"
[05:38:48] <Cork> hmm, i meant to say prefilters is what lets you do things like*
[05:40:24] <Cork> or event better things like data: { name: "john doe" } instead of data: "name=john+doe"
[05:41:24] <dimi1947> so prefilters are there just for format reasons?
[05:42:11] <Cork> prefileters is there for exactly what the name says "prefilter", or "preprocess" if you want another name
[05:44:01] <dimi1947> from the answer you gave this boils down to formatting...as I see it
[05:44:30] <Cork> that is simplifying it a bit too much
[05:44:49] <Cork> cause { p: 1 } to "p=1" isn't just formatting
[05:44:59] <Cork> it is actually changein an object into a string
[05:45:58] <Cork> it also does things like { accept: true } to "accept=1" or similar
[05:47:59] <dimi1947> why someone would want to transform the data like the way above...what is the point after all?
[05:49:49] <Cork> the second form is what query is, the former is what would make setting it normally looks like in $.ajax(url, { method: 'get', data: { source1: data, source2: data } }) looks like
[05:52:42] <Cork> meaing without it the second would instead look like $.ajax(url, { method: 'get', data: '?source1=' + data_that_is_already_escaped_to_be_query_safe + '&source2=' + ... });
[06:10:36] <dimi1947> remind me...we use prefilter to transform the former to the later...
[06:21:16] <dimi1947> Cork:
[06:29:39] <dimi1947> I assume is vice versa
[06:30:07] <dimi1947> forget it...I am confused
[06:31:57] <dimi1947> why someone would want to hange an object into a string?
[07:25:51] <Cork> dimi1947: cause the query you HAVE to send over the net is ex. http://example.com/path/test.html?source1=a&source2=b
[07:25:57] <Cork> so you can't have an object there
[07:37:45] <Rockwood> editor.js:3 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined  amazing i used migrate 1.4 and lib 3.4.1
[07:46:56] <Cork> $ is not defined means you load it before jquery...
[07:48:13] <dimi1947> Cork...I am starting to getting it...
[07:50:50] <dimi1947> so...with $.ajax you do not have the option of sending it like a string...and here comes prefilter to do exatly that
[07:51:20] <Cork> ... yes you do
[07:51:25] <Cork> but you have the option to not
[07:52:02] <dimi1947> of course...it depends on your needs
[07:52:27] <dimi1947> wrong...
[07:52:39] <dimi1947> I am trying to say something else...
[07:53:20] <dimi1947> you are saying that with $.ajax too I can send it like a string?
[07:54:43] <Cork> sure, not exactly as the format i took as an example, but it only trys to convert the input data from an object if that is what you give it
[07:56:54] <dimi1947> than if $.ajax can do it...what is the point is using prefilter in the first plaa?
[07:56:59] <dimi1947> place
[07:58:17] <Cork> ...
[07:58:23] <Cork> how do you think $.ajax does it?
[07:59:48] <Cork> note what i gave you about objects is just one example
[08:00:00] <Cork> the point of prefilters is to make it adjustable
[08:00:15] <Cork> before i think it was jquery 1.9 that was static
[08:02:04] <dimi1947> I think it would be good if you gave me an example...sth to be sent with $.ajax and the use preifilter to adjust it as you say..it does not have to be functional...just demo code
[10:47:04] <adder> does each() work directly on selectors? can I do this? $('.type div').each(function(tab) { tab.removeClass('active-tab'); });
[10:48:21] <adder> I mean I obviously can't, but why
[11:02:59] <forgotmynick> hello can anyone tell me why no data is sent? https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/zwDnQ5JhGK/
[11:44:48] <thykka> forgotmynick, what does form_data contain?
[11:45:06] <Jasein> if momentum is mass*vel, is momentum in the x direction =velocity in the x direction*mass?
[11:45:43] <thykka> sure, if you're using cartesian coords
[11:47:08] <Jasein> so plotting momentum as a vector wouldn't work then would it? since Mt=Math.sqret(mx+my)
[11:47:32] <Jasein> sorry
[11:47:50] <Jasein> Mt=Math.sqrt(mx*mx+my*my) ?
[11:49:04] <Jasein> Sorry, I thought this was #physics, my bad. thanks thykka.
[14:16:44] <primitivMedia> does prepend woprk with html?
[14:17:07] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/prepend/ - check out the "type" :)
[14:17:16] <robertmaxrees> "Type: htmlString or Element or Text or Array or jQuery"
[14:17:19] <primitivMedia> pardon?
[14:17:26] <primitivMedia> ahh
[14:17:31] <primitivMedia> so how would i go about prepending html
[14:17:46] <robertmaxrees> you... just do it?
[14:17:50] <robertmaxrees> not sure i understand the question :)
[14:25:39] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:24:15] <RandomSerb> is there a way to say if current element(stored in a var, or $(this)) is a parent of body which has id of...
[15:24:17] <RandomSerb> ?
[15:24:30] <RandomSerb> s/parent/child
[15:36:12] <royalty> if it has an id and you knwo thee id why would you care about the other details?
[15:36:17] <royalty> the*
[15:36:48] <royalty> oh you want to check rather than grab i suppose
[15:38:52] <royalty> RandomSerb, you can do the id check with .prop
[15:39:00] <royalty> you can do the parent check like so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3957017/jquery-if-target-is-child-of-wrapper-then-do-something
[15:39:30] <RandomSerb> royalty, actually, I just want to know which page am I on, which I can only deduce from body. That said, I just need to check if body has id of blah, or class of blah
[15:39:51] <royalty> oh ok
[15:40:52] <royalty> $('body').hasClass('someClass')
[15:41:07] <royalty> $(body).prop('id') i think
[15:41:10] <royalty> whatever
[15:41:14] <royalty> something like that or smething
[17:07:52] <silva> hello, I ahve created thos on click event "$(document).on('click', '.btn_save', function(event)", how can I trigger it by code, not by click?
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> RandomSerb no element can be "parent of body" except for <html>
[17:54:29] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[17:54:46] <RandomSerb> Robdgreat, two lines after that I wrote: s/parent/child
[17:55:00] <RandomSerb> robertmaxrees,
[17:55:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:55:22] <robertmaxrees> so you just wanna test if $(this) contains another element?
[17:56:44] <robertmaxrees> ah, nvm.  you just wanted to see what ID <body> has - got it :)
