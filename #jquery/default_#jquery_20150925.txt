[01:31:32] <km4> hi, have problem with modernizer localstorage
[01:32:09] <km4> if is aviable I have if(Modernizr.localstorage)
[01:33:13] <km4> how can I check localstore key ?
[01:34:57] <km4> var localStore = window.localStorage; ok have solution
[01:35:51] <Cork> km4: why store localStorage in a local variable?
[01:35:53] <Cork> just use it
[01:37:03] <Cork> meaning var localStorage = window.localStorage; localStorage.getItem()
[01:37:12] <Cork> is the same as localStorage.getItem()
[02:19:10] <km4> Cork: I make   if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
[02:19:10] <km4>     var ls = window.localStorage;
[02:19:10] <km4>     if (ls.tour_current_step < 4 && window.localStorage.getItem('tour_end') == null ) {
[02:19:13] <km4>       $fake_tour.addClass('when-tour');
[02:19:16] <km4>       $tour_init.css('z-index', 'inherit');
[02:19:19] <km4>     } else if (ls.tour_current_step >= 4 && window.localStorage.getItem('tour_end') == null ) {
[02:19:21] <km4>       $tour_init.css('z-index', 'inherit');
[02:19:24] <km4>     }
[02:24:56] <Cork> km4: i still don't get why you need to make a local variable of localStorage
[02:43:02] <Kartagis> `paste | km4

[04:45:02] <lilsammy> Has anyone used server side processing with datatables and been able to additionally use functions for columnDef data / defaultcontent? It doesn't appear to be working with server side processing
[04:48:19] <lilsammy> Nevermind I think I can do it with a rowCallBack
[05:11:36] <guest8810> https://jsfiddle.net/2wnf2efr/ can anyone tell what I am doing wrong here? I would like to show the ul when parent div is clicked
[05:11:55] <guest8810> in the real scenario there are multiple rn_HierLists, I would only like to show the one with clicked parent
[05:56:10] <Sourcey> Hello. I need to pass an easy GET parameter like I would do in a href. For example: ?type= VALUE&lang=LANG. Where VALUE and LANG are defined var's in the jquery code
[05:56:18] <Sourcey> to same page
[06:07:06] <Cork> Sourcey: you mean for an ajax call or what?
[06:19:06] <lintguy> Cork!
[06:19:20] <lintguy> Cork: Hope all is well and have a good day
[06:19:29] <Cork> sure, and thx
[06:19:40] <Cork> (and the same)
[06:19:59] <lintguy> (Cork is thinking, who the hell is that dude, leave me alone)
[06:20:28] <Cork> heh no we've talked enough for me to remember you :)
[06:20:49] <lintguy> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gnezI2hOXA
[06:20:56] <lintguy> Great, i hope :)
[06:21:27] <Sourcey> Cork: I did it simple with window.location = "/rfo?type="+type+"&lang="+lang;
[06:21:41] <Sourcey> I was thinking to complicated
[06:21:43] <Cork> Sourcey: i recommend using $.param
[06:21:50] <Cork> it makes it more readable
[06:22:21] <Sourcey> ok thanks
[06:22:21] <Cork>  window.location = '/rfo' + $.param({ type: type, lang: lang });
[06:22:39] <Cork> (not sure if you need ? there or not, i don't remember if $.param include it or not)
[06:22:47] <Sourcey> aight
[06:22:53] <Cork> ?api jquery.params
[06:22:53] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[06:22:54] <Cork> ?api jquery.param
[06:22:58] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.param(): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[06:23:32] <FilipNortic> if you resend an ajax request in .fail() does teh .always() function trigger after the new requests callback then?
[06:24:59] <FilipNortic> or does it depend on which order i put them in?
[06:38:02] <shoky> FilipNortic the .always will trigger but not after the new request is done, but before
[06:38:46] <shoky> cause it's an .always bound on the first request, not the 2nd
[06:39:22] <Kamuela> what's one thing that you all feel like jquery kicks ass it relative to vanilla js?
[06:39:30] <Kamuela> at*
[06:40:36] <shoky> DOM manipulation, event handling, ajax, dealing with cross-browser issues
[06:40:50] <kevin> ^
[06:44:40] <Kamuela> so everything :)
[06:44:47] <Uhkis> yeah, those one thing :D
[06:45:12] <Kamuela> just been running into a bit of an anti-jquery crowd lately, but I really couldn't see much wrong with it
[06:45:47] <Uhkis> i really like the slogan part
[06:45:53] <Uhkis> "write less, do more"
[06:46:21] <Uhkis> http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ ajax part especially. :D
[06:46:45] <Kamuela> lol I know
[06:46:59] <Kamuela> you might not need jquery, jquery vs. opcodes
[06:47:39] <Kamuela> I guess if you're doing one or two things it isn't worth the library but other than that
[06:48:46] <Uhkis> var request = new XMLHtt.....screw this, $.get();

[07:47:43] <bug> okey kevin
[07:48:42] <kevin> bug, http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ ... if you look at the source option, you can see you can provide a variety of parameters

[07:51:56] <bug> if i want to get the id of selected item what option is there inside select ?
[07:52:51] <zumba_addict> good morning. With this code which are promises returned by fetch() which is really from jquery, will the "this.allPromises" be fulfilled if one of the promise failed? this.allPromises = [this.promiseA, this.promiseB];
[08:00:50] <shoky_> zumba_addict  that's just an array. arrays don't get fulfilled ;p
[08:01:41] <shoky_> but if you're talking about passing that to $.when.apply  then no, it won't be resolved if one of the promises fails
[08:01:44] <zumba_addict> i remember doing a code back at my previous job. It looked like this
[08:01:51] <shoky_> it'll fail when one of the promises fail
[08:01:54] <zumba_addict> yes, it' the $.when
[08:02:07] <zumba_addict> got it. I got my answers. Thanks
[08:02:17] <zumba_addict> i'm debugging the same crap, LOL
[08:02:23] <shoky_> yah ;p
[08:03:37] <zumba_addict> :D
[08:04:12] <zumba_addict> at my all job, I remember using $q all something
[08:04:20] <zumba_addict> we were using angular
[08:04:34] <zumba_addict> couldn't remember if q.all is angular native
[08:05:08] <zumba_addict> yeah, i think it's native angular - https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q
[08:08:58] <kevin> bug, hmm.. i dunno... can you paste your code somewhere?
[08:09:06] <bug> yeah kevin
[08:09:10] <bug> vwait
[08:54:46] <lewix> guys stupid question - my memory fails me
[08:54:54] <lewix> $(document) vs document.
[08:55:10] <lewix> whats the diff
[08:55:50] <jphase> same object for the most part, one is just returned in array like selectors do so that you can chain other jQuery methods to it
[08:56:04] <jphase> lewix: just open up console and type them one at a time and press enter
[08:56:07] <jphase> you'll see the difference
[08:56:23] <jphase> jQuery(document) vs document
[08:56:27] <lewix> jphase: im confused cause i have a method which work with the former but not the later
[08:56:37] <jphase> lewix: which method?
[08:56:39] <lewix> $(document).foundation()
[08:57:01] <jphase> right - that's a jQuery method that foundation framework's JS added
[08:57:07] <lewix> ahhh
[08:57:21] <lewix> jphase: gracias
[08:57:25] <lewix> thanks
[08:57:25] <jphase> de nada
[10:03:23] <zumba_addict> no kidding, Safari doesn't show the response data!
[10:08:34] <dynamite> Probably a basic question but I know how to run a function when a drop down field is changed(.change) how can I run the same function on the drop down when its changed and when the page is initially loaded?
[10:08:53] <duch_kazatel> abstract it out and run it.
[10:09:01] <duch_kazatel> so var myFunction = function() {console.log('foo')};
[10:09:16] <duch_kazatel> then $('myDropdown').on('change', myFunction);
[10:09:22] <duch_kazatel> and myFunction(); somewhere
[10:09:25] <dynamite> I see
[10:10:26] <Uhkis> is there a difference between function x() and x = function()
[10:10:26] <dynamite> thanks alot
[10:10:50] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis the latter hoists the variable declaraion.  there are 3 different kinds of function declarations in js.
[10:11:20] <Uhkis> what's the third?
[10:11:34] <duch_kazatel> var foo = function myFunction() {}
[10:12:01] <Uhkis> hmm, so calling foo() and myFunction() is the same thing?
[10:12:04] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4xa58jnq/
[10:12:35] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis not in that case :)
[10:13:05] <zumba_addict> i found the culprit but I don't know why it's happening
[10:13:24] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict what's up?
[10:13:34] <zumba_addict> the problem is that our code is calling both laptop and mobile even if I am only in laptop
[10:13:38] <zumba_addict> i'm separating it
[10:13:51] <zumba_addict> now, the promise results gets mixed up on the two
[10:13:56] <zumba_addict> which is weird
[10:14:31] <zumba_addict> sometimes, the result of mobile output gets in to the laptop model but in network tab, the output is correct
[10:14:49] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict then you need to make sure you separate your calls and that your logic is right.
[10:14:52] <zumba_addict> hey duch_kazatel, what's up
[10:14:56] <zumba_addict> yup
[10:15:40] <zumba_addict> it should only make a call to laptop or greater than > 768 if my screen is really bigger than that and should not call the mobile function
[10:15:41] <NitroLiq> Anyone here use foundation for prototyping? I'm setting up app.js where my jquery code goes but I'm wondering about foundation's init script: $(document).foundation(); Do I put this outside my own IIFE which contains all my jquery, or put inside? Doesn't seem logical to have two 'ready' functions.
[10:15:55] <zumba_addict> right now, both are being called, LOL
[10:16:00] <Uhkis> i've said it before and ill say it again: js can be really weird
[10:16:04] <zumba_addict> waste of network bandwidth
[10:16:07] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq iife and document ready are not the same.
[10:16:42] <zumba_addict> but the question is, why is the value getting mixed up in the model when I see it clearly while in debug mode
[10:16:58] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict promises are funny things.
[10:17:03] <zumba_addict> ok
[10:17:06] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you can only resolve them once.
[10:17:14] <NitroLiq> I'm talking about the shortcut version that many folks use
[10:17:14] <duch_kazatel> so depending on how everything is wired, that might be the issue?
[10:17:27] <zumba_addict> both are different xhr calls
[10:17:33] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq i'd have to see a more concrete example of your code then.
[10:17:39] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict no idea then without seeing the code.
[10:17:44] <zumba_addict> k
[10:17:51] <zumba_addict> i'll separate them and see if it still happens
[10:18:53] <NitroLiq> There's nothing to show, really. Think of your standard techniques of wrapping all your jquery in a ready function.
[10:19:12] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq your quesiton is really strange, then.  you shouldn't put everything in a document ready.
[10:19:20] <NitroLiq> And to init FOundation, they give you this: $(document).foundation()
[10:19:38] <duch_kazatel> in fact, if there's a single "init" style call, only that should be in the document ready, but only if that relies on elements loaded into the document after your code.
[10:20:10] <duch_kazatel> so unless you have code that's making calls to the document before that init, there's no need for a doc ready on them.
[10:23:24] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq like... http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9bb9orbb/2/
[10:23:35] <duch_kazatel> only the init call needs to be in a document ready in this case.
[10:24:18] <duch_kazatel> though i've never liked the weird monolithic singleton thing.
[10:25:43] <NitroLiq> I think I just read about that pattern in Zakas' book.
[10:25:55] <duch_kazatel> some people love it.
[10:26:27] <NitroLiq> I'm all for better organization and learning when to do or not do something. Was looking at this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18307078/jquery-best-practises-in-case-of-document-ready
[10:27:02] <NitroLiq> and I suppose I fall into the group of developers that just throws everything in a ready function for prototyping
[10:27:03] <duch_kazatel> so a doc ready inside an iife
[10:27:27] <duch_kazatel> do you get the idea behind the "why" on all of that?
[10:27:31] <NitroLiq> just ready function then all my indifidula functions inside that
[10:28:00] <duch_kazatel> heh, and what about the IIFE.
[10:28:13] <Arnas> hello
[10:28:13] <duch_kazatel> because depending on the case, that's a little... overkill imo.
[10:28:24] <Arnas> how can I get the ID of a clicked anchor link?
[10:28:39] <duch_kazatel> Arnas this.id
[10:28:48] <NitroLiq> It was more to prevent conflicts with anything else. I was just curious about that foundation piece
[10:29:00] <Arnas> duch_kazatel, hm?
[10:29:09] <duch_kazatel> Arnas insite the event handler.
[10:29:12] <duch_kazatel> that'll get you the id.
[10:29:39] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq the foundation call should go in the doc ready if it doesn't already imply one on its own.
[10:30:12] <NitroLiq> That's what I was wondering...whether it does or not
[10:31:04] <duch_kazatel> foundation.zurb.com/docs/javascript.html#initialize-foundation
[10:31:06] <duch_kazatel> implies not.
[10:34:50] <NitroLiq> The way I've done it in the past is create the ready function then an init(). Inside the actual init function are all the other function calls on the page. Then, after that are all the function definitions
[10:35:15] <duch_kazatel> right, so your ready needs to call that init.
[10:35:17] <NitroLiq> I can see similarities in the link you send
[10:35:37] <NitroLiq> just a diffeent way of writing it. I'll have to play around with it a bit.
[10:35:47] <duch_kazatel> there's no need to do it all that way fwiw.
[10:36:28] <NitroLiq> In all honesty, None of this probably needs to be in a ready
[10:36:40] <duch_kazatel> except for the stuff that relies on the document.
[10:36:56] <NitroLiq> example?
[10:37:05] <duch_kazatel> $('something');
[10:37:27] <NitroLiq> Most everything I'm putting in there are DOM-related
[10:37:28] <duch_kazatel> anything that calls that needs to be done either right before </body> or in a document ready
[10:37:42] <duch_kazatel> show an example :)
[10:37:46] <NitroLiq> search toggles and whatnot
[10:37:54] <duch_kazatel> becuase depending on how you're calling it, it may or may not need to be in a doc ready.
[10:38:24] <NitroLiq> yeah, script is before </body>
[10:38:34] <duch_kazatel> then you don't need any document ready at all.
[10:41:03] <duch_kazatel> for the mental model: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p6x27rkf/1/
[10:43:29] <NitroLiq> You would still wrap each function in an IFFE?
[10:43:42] <duch_kazatel> in that fiddle, i did.
[10:43:43] <NitroLiq> IIFE rather
[10:44:12] <duch_kazatel> depending on the codebase, the iife is nice to make a scope.
[10:44:45] <NitroLiq> I could still use that singleton pattern as well
[10:44:52] <NitroLiq> easy to scan
[10:44:52] <duch_kazatel> eh.
[10:45:02] <duch_kazatel> i'd disagree with that, but meh.
[10:46:51] <NitroLiq> I'm used to writing separate named functions anyway. It's just piqued my interest
[10:47:58] <NitroLiq> Thx for the enlightenment
[10:48:03] <duch_kazatel> fsho.
[10:49:37] <zumba_addict> need your help folks. Since I commented out bind, I lost `this`. What is the workaround? http://pastebin.com/B22Y4ydH
[10:49:51] <zumba_addict> I commented it out because I don't need the promise anymore
[10:49:52] <duch_kazatel> wut
[10:50:33] <duch_kazatel> that really depends.
[10:50:55] <zumba_addict> k
[10:51:14] <zumba_addict> i'm thinking of something like var _this = this on where I got the value
[10:51:21] <duch_kazatel> use .bind() for that.
[10:51:33] <duch_kazatel> var _this = this; or that = thise or whatever is an antipattern.
[10:51:42] <duch_kazatel> just need to figure out where your bind call needs to be.
[10:51:59] <zumba_addict> k
[10:52:21] <zumba_addict> maybe i'll wrap it in iife
[10:52:29] <duch_kazatel> that's... not going to change anything.
[10:52:40] <duch_kazatel> you need to figure out where your context is getting broken,.
[10:52:43] <duch_kazatel> and fix that.
[10:52:58] <zumba_addict> k
[10:53:55] <zumba_addict> ah, previous code was using the promise. Now that i've taken it out, the this now is referring to the render: functino
[10:54:08] <duch_kazatel> right.  the place that makes the call to this code.
[10:54:17] <duch_kazatel> think of 'this' like invocation context.
[10:54:32] <zumba_addict> yup
[10:55:13] <zumba_addict> the "this.mobileFooterView" gets created inside initialize: function
[10:55:26] <zumba_addict> and I am accessing it literally like that in render: function
[10:55:28] <duch_kazatel> created or run from?
[10:55:36] <zumba_addict> created
[10:55:48] <duch_kazatel> invocation, not creation.
[10:55:52] <duch_kazatel> you care about where you called the function from.
[10:56:48] <zumba_addict> this is the code in initialize method    this.mobileFooterView = adViews.footerView;
[10:57:15] <zumba_addict> ok, let me look at where I am calling it
[10:58:47] <zumba_addict> are you asking who called the render method?
[11:00:20] <django_> can i do: $('#myid).height() =30px ?
[11:00:58] <hapi> to set: height(30) to get: heigth()
[11:01:41] <django_> $('#myid).height(30)
[11:01:42] <django_> like that?
[11:01:49] <hapi> yes
[11:06:59] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you keep doing this - not giving enough context and assuming i know your app fwiw
[11:07:21] <zumba_addict> i just restored the promise and changed this code
[11:07:25] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:07:27] <duch_kazatel> 'kay
[11:07:30] <django_> sigh not working
[11:09:26] <zumba_addict> FROM this.allPromises = [this.laptopPromise, this.mobilePromise]; INTO this.allPromises = [this.mobilePromise] and this.allPromises = [this.laptopPromise]; in each separate IF statements. Then I restored the $.when that I commented out(shown in pastebin). It's working great now
[11:09:52] <duch_kazatel> heh
[11:09:52] <zumba_addict> so now, only one XHR is made which is nice
[11:10:04] <zumba_addict> previously 2 calls at the same time
[11:10:21] <zumba_addict> promises are sometimes weird :D
[11:10:43] <zumba_addict> and like what you mentioned earlier, only one can get resolved
[11:10:48] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[11:10:49] <duch_kazatel> no.
[11:11:04] <duch_kazatel> one promise can only get resolved once.
[11:11:16] <zumba_addict> oh yeah, thanks for correcting me
[11:11:39] <duch_kazatel> resolved or rejected.
[11:12:02] <zumba_addict> i'll conduct few more test and if I don't see anymore errors, i'll create a fix branch
[11:12:06] <zumba_addict> then make a PR :)

[12:28:39] <karun> Hey guys. I've been having this weird problem with Firefox. I make an ajax post to a resource which sets a cookie. Firefox sees the response cookie but it doesn't set it in subsequent requests. The path is "/" and it's not cross domain. Can someone please help?
[12:59:22] <Izacht13> Can someone please tell why this glitch is happening, and how to stop it? http://aerracen.net/ What I'm seeing is this, in case its local: http://puu.sh/knVR2/266c9cb6aa.png
[12:59:40] <Izacht13> The HTML says that shouldnt be render like that, the CSS doesnt seem to effect it.
[12:59:52] <Izacht13> It just seems to be a visual bug.
[12:59:56] <Izacht13> I was told to come here.
[13:00:03] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13 - I think there's a login screen + you should post that section of your jquery into a fiddle
[13:00:18] <Izacht13> Your here too?
[13:00:23] <Izacht13> Well then.
[13:00:23] <SpecialTechnique> I'm everywhere
[13:00:28] <Izacht13> :P
[13:00:32] <Izacht13> Ill do that.
[13:00:54] <Izacht13> Might be a large JSFiddle though.
[13:01:35] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13 is it this? http://aerracen.net/script.js
[13:01:57] <Izacht13> That is infact the Javascript.
[13:07:51] <SpecialTechnique> Izacth13: $('ul.categories li.' + json.categories[c].parent + ' .subcont').append --- in this section you're appending to the div, not even the UL
[13:08:33] <SpecialTechnique> you'd want: $('ul.categories li.' + json.categories[c].parent + ' .subcont > ul').append(
[13:10:57] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13: you should really take a second look at the code, you messed up with how the html is outputted in a lot of placed
[13:11:00] <SpecialTechnique> places*
[13:11:19] <Izacht13> Im trying to get it to work in a JSFiddle,
[13:12:44] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13:  just to give you an idea on line 22 you end your append like this - </div></ul><li>
[13:12:48] <Izacht13> SpecialTechnique: This is the closed I got to reproducing it in JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gh6b11kv/
[13:12:52] <SpecialTechnique> the li isn't even closed correctly
[13:13:02] <Izacht13> Line 22 of the JS?
[13:13:18] <SpecialTechnique> yea
[13:13:36] <SpecialTechnique> and that jsfiddel is worthless :P it doesn't do the same stuff youre actual JS is doing ;)
[13:14:30] <SpecialTechnique> Line 28 you're using the wrong selector
[13:14:52] <SpecialTechnique>  .subcont > ul' should be the ending of that selector
[13:16:34] <Utils> So I add a li element to a ul element using jQuery. The li's are display: inline-block; and I believe I'm getting added spacing as a result of the inline-block. In HTML you can just use <!-- --> to escape white space... but how does that work in jQuery?
[13:16:44] <Utils> How do I eliminate that white space caused by inline-block?
[13:18:00] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/m52kjp8L/2/ Why doesn't the second confirmation.click() work?
[13:18:28] <SpecialTechnique> Utils: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5078239/how-to-remove-the-space-between-inline-block-elements
[13:18:29] <Izacht13> SpecialTechnique: That last change broke the site.
[13:18:38] <blakespot> Ok, I've got: $('#nav-container-links a').click(function(e) {
[13:18:56] <blakespot> And I Want to start out a function like that, but I am not dealing with anchors but with the parent div and child divs
[13:19:05] <blakespot> vs. parent div and anchors in my code example
[13:19:14] <blakespot> how can I do that - some type of child indication?
[13:19:35] <blakespot> $('#nav-container-links [the child divs]').click(function(e) {
[13:20:16] <Utils> SpecialTechnique: well a few of those aren't achievable via jquery, such as comments between </li> and <li> which i previously used. skip closing, i'm not sure... could try that. and of course removing whitespace wouldn't work in jquery either... but ill try the font-size
[13:20:46] <SpecialTechnique> Utils you can use jquery to self close the ul
[13:22:16] <DarkSector> This is so weird, I can see the class in the html but it just won't trigger on click()
[13:22:16] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/m52kjp8L/4/
[13:22:23] <SpecialTechnique> Utils: http://jsfiddle.net/n3z3Lwbq/
[13:22:43] <Izacht13> SpecialTechnique: I fixed the mistakes you pointed out, but alas the visual bug remains.
[13:25:11] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13: do you have a visual representation of how it's suppose to look?
[13:25:22] <SpecialTechnique> Also why does every subcont have a position absolute? :(
[13:25:32] <Izacht13> Oh...
[13:25:34] <Izacht13> Hm...
[13:25:40] <Izacht13> That might be the issue.
[13:26:09] <Utils> jquery self-closes it SpecialTechnique ? doesn't seem to make a difference :/
[13:26:13] <Utils> ill try the font one moment
[13:26:52] <Utils> font-size: 0; on the ul actually does work.
[13:26:58] <Utils> i'm cool wiht that.
[13:27:51] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13: Yea, I'd definitely look deeper into what you've written previously and see what logic you used behind it when writing it, cause it seems that the issue can be from either jquery, css or html at this point :(
[13:28:38] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/m52kjp8L/4/ Guys any insight on this issue?
[13:28:51] <duch_kazatel> what's the issue?
[13:29:10] <DarkSector> duch_kazatel, the methods confirmation.click() doesn't get triggerred
[13:29:33] <DarkSector> after the replacement
[13:29:53] <SpecialTechnique> Utils: Be careful, it could break children with relative font sizes
[13:30:03] <SpecialTechnique> but if it's find for you, then ok
[13:30:07] <SpecialTechnique> fine*
[13:30:19] <duch_kazatel> DarkSector you need delegated listewners insead.
[13:30:22] <Izacht13> SpecialTechnique: This is much deeper than just a visual glitch, But I think you've helped me uncover the issue, thanks.
[13:30:41] <DarkSector> duch_kazatel, so I should have href="methodName()"?
[13:30:46] <DarkSector> sorry onClick?
[13:30:46] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:30:51] <duch_kazatel> never onclick
[13:30:53] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:30:57] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:31:01] <SpecialTechnique> Izacht13: np, hopefully  you get everything figured out!
[13:31:05] <duch_kazatel> check these out.
[13:31:21] <DarkSector> duch_kazatel, gotcha, reading up. Thanks :)
[13:31:37] <Utils> you should fix your if statements DarkSector. the ids are yes-1 no-1 etc and you're checking for yes/no
[13:31:38] <duch_kazatel> DarkSector basically, a slightly different syntax.  you'll get it pretty quickly.
[13:31:44] <DarkSector> Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time.
[13:31:46] <DarkSector> Perfect
[13:32:12] <DarkSector> Utils, yeah, I was about to, the thing was I never got to it because I didn't have delegated events
[13:32:32] <DarkSector> Utils, actually I am checking for result which is split()[0]
[13:32:35] <DarkSector> so that's correct
[13:32:38] <DarkSector> Isn't it?
[13:32:43] <Utils> oh yeah
[13:32:46] <Utils> didnt' see that my bad.
[13:32:50] <DarkSector> no problem :)
[13:32:55] <DarkSector> anyway, I think I can fix it now
[13:32:55] <duch_kazatel> also: $(this).attr("id").split('-')[1];
[13:33:01] <DarkSector> yes?
[13:33:02] <duch_kazatel> just add a data attribute.
[13:33:06] <DarkSector> oh good point
[13:33:08] <DarkSector> let me do that
[13:33:21] <DarkSector> I should start doing that everywhere
[13:33:27] <duch_kazatel> data-client-id='foo' then your code is $(this).data('client-id')
[13:33:32] <duch_kazatel> much more readable.
[13:33:49] <DarkSector> Yes, I agree
[13:33:51] <DarkSector> I'll replace it
[13:33:54] <DarkSector> Thanks
[13:33:56] <duch_kazatel> ++
[15:16:22] <STEVOOO> I've previously worked with php, html, css, and some early versions of jQuery and later switched to FORTRAN, c++, matlab, Ada etc. Am i gonna have problems "relearning" jQuery or is the newer versions similar to the first ones?
[15:16:34] <duch_kazatel> pretty similar library.
[15:16:40] <duch_kazatel> javascript's changed a bit though.
[15:23:05] <STEVOOO> duch_kazatel: I've always been a programmer that using plain text programs.. I mean like i write EVERYTHING myself. In notepad, notepad++ or something, eclipse if i use linux.. Is the jQuery docs still accessable ?
[15:23:25] <STEVOOO> jquery.com/func i mean :)

[17:52:16] <zeroquake> animating scrollLeft with x seconds , is setTimeout only way to account for animation time and execute a method after scroll ?
[18:10:29] <blobbagus> anyone home? :)
[18:12:36] <duch_kazatel> zeroquake there's a promise that you can use.
[18:12:40] <duch_kazatel> there's also a success callback.
[18:13:03] <zeroquake> yup there is a complete key ....thank you
[18:13:37] <blobbagus> anyone want to suggest a library?
[18:13:49] <duch_kazatel> blobbagus for what?
[18:16:00] <blobbagus> I have a sidebar div with contact form. I want it fixed, which is working great. Is there something that will animate its position on scroll?
[18:16:31] <blobbagus> I need something that has easing and top\bottom bounds... I could build it, but ofc don't *want* to lol
[18:17:06] <blobbagus> flat-fixed just seems a little... .... ...dead X(
[18:32:48] <RockinAkin> hi there
[18:33:30] <RockinAkin> can anyone help me figure out how to use Regex in JQuery to seperate the values in my header's background: rgba(#,#,#,#)
[18:33:59] <duch_kazatel> why use regex?
[18:34:10] <RockinAkin> how else can I get those values?
[18:34:12] <duch_kazatel> .split() and .replace() instead.
[18:35:36] <RockinAkin> hmmm
[18:35:38] <RockinAkin> interesting
[18:36:08] <duch_kazatel> .split(',').replace('rgba(', '').replace(')', ''); or something like that.
[18:36:14] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[18:36:21] <RockinAkin> so how would I apply split and replace to only get, say the last # from the rgba(#,#,#,#)
[18:36:26] <duch_kazatel> .replace('rgba(', '').replace(')', '').split(',');
[18:36:32] <duch_kazatel> you're not "array split and replace"
[18:36:34] <duch_kazatel> string split and replace.
[18:37:23] <RockinAkin> when i dont know what the first 3 numbers will be
[18:37:30] <RockinAkin> as the user will set them in their CSS
[18:37:30] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to.
[18:37:43] <duch_kazatel> grab the length of the resultant array and grab the length - 1
[18:38:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5513nak1/
[18:41:08] <RockinAkin> oh... interesting
[18:41:29] <RockinAkin> thank you, let me look this over
