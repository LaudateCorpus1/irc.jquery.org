[00:12:50] <_August_> nvm got it
[01:42:25] <Alturic> hey guys, I have a $('.class').click(function() { console.log("foo"); } and it works great... a little too great. I have multiple element.class elements, so I'm presuming it's because it's using a class selector and not id, but if I click one element it only triggers once. However if I click a second element it triggers two times. If I click a third element, it triggers three times, etc.
[01:42:45] <Alturic> Is that expected functionality? :-/ Is there anyway to have the .click "reset" on each element.class click?
[01:44:01] <Alturic> Bleh, it's possible it's because it's a .click, inside of a .click.
[01:44:38] <Alturic> Yea, that's definitely why.
[01:45:50] <Alturic> So, I'm using the first .click to open a modal, which is populated with a 2 buttons. I want to do A when button 1 is .clicked and do B when button 2 is .clicked. Would it be simply moving the button .clicks outside of the main .click?
[02:04:04] <Cork> Alturic: that only happens if you rebind the click handler in the click handler
[02:04:08] <Cork> something you shouldn't do
[02:05:36] <Cork> Alturic: if you don't know of doing so, make a jsfiddle.net with the code you're having problem with

[05:10:58] * AdamPDotty aggrees
[06:46:20] <ismithers> I am using a text editor plugin that has some code that looks as in this image https://db.tt/gjDLqWJx is there any way I can expose the _plainPasteClean function so that I can call it from JavaScript? I'm not entirely familiar with the structure and how they have implemented it ($.FE.MODULES.paste... etc)
[07:28:27] <anli_> What is wrong with $('a[href^="#"]').map(function(x){ return x.attr('href');}); ?
[07:28:37] <anli_> Getting all links that are anchors
[07:31:34] <AdamPDotty> Why do you map?
[07:32:14] <anli_> oh, seems like I only get integers into map, do you have a better suggestion?
[07:33:32] <AdamPDotty> The part you want to map seems to suffice.
[07:34:07] <anli_> $('a[href^="#"]').map(function(idx, x) { return x.href;});
[07:34:11] <anli_> (corrected)
[07:35:32] <anli_> Only comments seem to have anchors in stackoverflow, but answers do not
[07:35:35] <AdamPDotty> Ah, you want the anchor parts not the nodes.
[07:35:44] <anli_> yeah, a list of anchors
[07:36:13] <anli_> Seems like the callback function of map takes two parameters then
[07:36:24] <AdamPDotty> Seems I mixed .map and .filter
[07:36:37] <anli_> ok
[07:37:09] <AdamPDotty> I should experiment some more with those. Does this.href work?
[07:38:40] <AdamPDotty> documentation says no
[07:39:34] <anli_> It worked for almost all links
[07:39:51] <anli_> The last one became undefined
[07:40:12] <anli_> oh, wait, it worked, that was only the return value
[07:40:36] <anli_> So I do not have to send parameters to map at all
[07:40:50] <AdamPDotty> hmm, I tried with this and it succeeded. So you do not need any parameters.
[07:40:55] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[07:40:59] <anli_> nice
[08:00:11] <cannap> hi , can any see why data is not replacing http://laravel.io/bin/Gy870
[08:00:20] <cannap> consoel.log shows me the right
[08:00:27] <cannap> but when i check console its not replaced
[08:00:35] <cannap> also inspect the option
[08:01:31] <AdamPDotty> semicolon after log() ?
[08:01:43] <AdamPDotty> ah, generally missing
[08:02:29] <cannap> what for semicolon xD
[08:02:35] <cannap> normal i dont write any semicolon
[08:02:50] <cannap> it js not php :D
[08:03:31] <AdamPDotty> line 3 works?
[08:04:14] <AdamPDotty> plus options each would be more obvious here, right?
[08:04:47] <cannap> sure you are right
[08:04:50] <cannap> wait i change to each
[08:04:52] <cannap> i bet it will work
[08:05:04] <cannap> i dont know why i use map for this
[08:07:11] <cannap> @AdamPDotty, i ddont know why this is not working http://codepen.io/cannap/pen/JbrmgX
[08:07:18] <cannap> its not replaced when i inspect -.-
[08:09:35] <AdamPDotty> missing bracket after "this"
[08:09:42] <cannap> i fixed
[08:09:52] <cannap> yea forgot ) on $(this)
[08:10:23] <cannap> i have no idea why this is not working
[08:10:29] <AdamPDotty> is it not?
[08:10:35] <cannap> i dont know
[08:10:39] <cannap> when console log
[08:10:41] <cannap> the new option
[08:10:45] <cannap> there is still no -
[08:10:49] <cannap> instead of space
[08:10:59] <cannap> https://gyazo.com/fcdf2166ab863642411ab9b9c4b0142c
[08:11:26] <AdamPDotty> console.log(options.eq(1).data('filter-value'));
[08:12:20] <AdamPDotty> try that at the end, and it will show you the new value.
[08:14:10] <cannap> awesome
[08:14:18] <cannap> but why i cant see this in inspector?
[08:15:20] <AdamPDotty> You inspect the markup. That does not really matter once it got rendered.
[08:15:35] <cannap> but when i use animate as example i see css changes
[08:15:36] <cannap> ah
[08:15:44] <cannap> now i understand .,.
[08:15:45] <AdamPDotty> data is assigned to a node in the DOM
[08:15:45] <cannap> thx
[08:16:11] <cannap> i have never manipulated the data value
[08:16:16] <cannap> normal i would do this on the server
[08:16:20] <cannap> this is just a hotfix
[08:16:37] <cannap> also replacing space with -
[08:16:41] <cannap> ^^
[08:25:21] <AdamPDotty> yeah, when I did not get access to the live server, I had a whole script to mainpulate the live result.
[08:25:23] * AdamPDotty sighs
[08:29:25] <elit3x> I am trying to bind a click event using  .On() to a dynamic button. I can get it to work in jsfiddle, but not on my drupal website. Any tips? --> http://pastebin.com/NkV7r9PA
[08:30:21] <elit3x> This is the jsfiddle, but it is not dynamically loading the button. I am new to jquery/JS --> https://jsfiddle.net/53o56cqu/1/
[08:35:00] <lng> Hi! This statement returns string - $('#entity-move-tpl').html();,  but I need it to be an object. #entity-move-tpl is <tamplate> element. How to make it object?
[08:35:41] <lng> parseHTML?
[08:36:05] <AdamPDotty> $('#entity-move-tpl').eq(0);
[08:37:40] <lng> wow
[08:37:43] <lng> tnx!
[08:40:56] <lng> AdamPDotty: and how do I convert it back to string to use it in after()?
[08:42:03] <MikeD_> you probably don't need to convert it
[08:42:22] <lng> something wrong then
[08:42:26] <lng> need to debug
[08:43:45] <lng> actually, $('#entity-move-tpl') is object too
[08:44:10] <MikeD_> do you have a jsfiddle example ?
[08:45:10] <lng> creating
[08:54:26] <lng> MikeD_: https://jsfiddle.net/phLf5e55/
[08:55:04] <lng> what I need to do is to add hidden input field each time
[08:55:19] <lng> with entityCode value
[08:55:59] <cannap> @AdamPDotty,  this was not working i forgot the shit was already generated with js
[08:56:18] <cannap> then i just added the .replace to the function which generates the option
[08:56:22] <cannap> but not my problem
[08:56:34] <cannap> i dont like to fix stuff like this
[08:56:46] <cannap> but anyway he want no server and fu*** typo3
[09:09:37] <lng> solved
[09:13:56] <MikeD_> lng: weird
[09:17:07] <dminuoso> Hi. Is there some pattern of jQuery utility that I can use to set up delayed actions? I have an input field and want to do things on the change event - but only if the user has stopped typing for 200ms.
[09:17:22] <dminuoso> My instinct was just setTimeout, but it felt a bit crude.
[09:18:44] <dminuoso> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4cbd91b3b97b4f2d13a0d172280db1c9 that was my first idea.
[09:18:46] <MikeD_> change won't even fire until you leave the control
[09:19:05] <dminuoso> MikeD_: Uhh, keyup then :)
[09:19:59] <MikeD_> then stick with the crude you can understand... rather than someone else's magic that you don't
[09:20:25] <MikeD_> oh wait, i'm in #jquery...  there's a plug in or somesuch, download more library :p
[09:20:39] <MikeD_> .autocomplete()
[09:20:41] <dminuoso> Im not going to download a library to do this.
[09:20:49] <MikeD_> yeah, i was being sarcastic
[09:21:21] <dminuoso> MikeD_: Interesting. autocomplete is exactly what I was aiming for - but I need it a bit more custom than that. :)
[09:22:02] <MikeD_> yeah.  if you started with autocomplete you'd have nearly rewritten everything you want on top of it by the time you were finished
[09:24:50] <dminuoso> MikeD_: Now I have to figure out whether it's safe to use setTimeout inside react components..
[09:55:48] <dminuoso> MikeD_: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b8dc5fcb00f582cd9206caba6ac79168
[09:55:52] <dminuoso> Works like a charm. :)
[09:56:43] <dminuoso> Ops. Here is the correct one: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/58d934e173c37efc8988aa2e43327448
[10:16:25] <hlve> Hi jQuery.
[10:16:30] * hlve strokes jQuery.
[10:16:41] <MikeD_> ?
[10:16:55] <hlve> Â¿
[10:20:14] <MassDebates> Hi there
[10:21:01] <MassDebates> http://brinley.github.io/jSignature/ I found this to be a much nicer solution to capturing signatures than the other one I used recently
[10:21:41] <MassDebates> If anyone has any leisure time to test it on that demo, I'd like to hear your feedback on anything I should change or improve before using/deploying
[10:22:12] <MassDebates> I like the 1 second delay before using simplify to smooth & 'lock-in' the stroke
[10:24:37] <MikeD_> the demo isn't really clear what features you're illustrating
[10:25:30] <dminuoso> MikeD_: Final version: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c8fe12f5ebe9da90d42a32265a63e567
[10:25:33] <dminuoso> Looks great. :)
[10:26:56] <dglambert> yo
[10:29:49] <stennowork> good day, i want to implement a simple draggable image gallery. i have a container element, with lots of image elements in it. What i want is: when i drag an image, the whole container element should be moved into the drag direction
[10:29:53] <stennowork> so far so good
[10:30:35] <hlve> is there a question to that statement?
[10:30:36] <hlve> :P
[10:30:55] <stennowork> when i start my dragging by click-holding on an image, the browser will try to move the image itself. i tried to stop this by putting e.preventDefault(); but this causes "dragend" to not trigger
[10:31:30] <hlve> what are you putting the preventdefault on?
[10:31:46] <stennowork> how can i prevent the default "image drag" behaviour of a browser but still trigger dragend?
[10:31:57] <hlve> with css.
[10:32:02] <stennowork> hlve, on the image container, not on the images themselves.
[10:32:23] <stennowork> idk if user-select works
[10:32:25] <stennowork> lemme try
[10:32:32] <hlve> it should.
[10:33:05] <stennowork> nope
[10:33:27] <stennowork> lemme write up a testcase on jsfiddle
[10:33:33] <hlve> ^^.
[10:36:13] <MassDebates> curious
[10:36:17] <MassDebates> what CSS is he supposed to use?
[10:36:33] <MassDebates> are you referring to pointer events?
[10:37:29] <MassDebates> That'd be interesting to implement. He could throw wrappers on each image, run the drag stuff on there, and then disable the image pointer events.
[10:37:31] <hlve> user-select, MassDebates. it prevents selecting/dragging
[10:37:41] <MassDebates> Ew
[10:37:45] <MassDebates> I would hate that.
[10:37:47] <hlve> that's what he wants.
[10:37:55] <hlve> he wants to disable browser native dragging
[10:38:03] <stennowork> yes
[10:38:05] <MassDebates> I think he's looking to avoid the copy function
[10:38:14] <hlve> i don't think you read anything he said
[10:38:14] <stennowork> native dragging of an image
[10:38:15] <hlve> lol
[10:38:21] <MassDebates> disabling user-select I think would be a bad way to go with CSS>
[10:39:01] <MassDebates> user-select's not the best part of the spec atm until google stops its bitchfight with the other browsers and ff can't keep up
[10:39:21] <MassDebates> advise he at least considers exploring the possibility of handling wrappers with images inside.
[10:39:29] <stennowork> please i am here
[10:39:36] <stennowork> no reason to talk to me in 3rd person :v
[10:39:40] <MassDebates> advise you at least considers exploring the possibility of handling wrappers with images inside.
[10:39:43] <stennowork> ^_^
[10:39:56] <MassDebates> stennowork:  wanna trade?
[10:40:04] <stennowork> a second please
[10:40:45] <MassDebates> Willing to make you a conceptual demonstration of such CSS & HTML if you make a codepen demonstrating the signature plugin i've linked above
[10:40:53] <MassDebates> I can do your js too if uw ant
[10:42:37] <stennowork> no i just want to know how it could work, i could implement it myself then
[10:43:40] <MassDebates> <wrapper><img></wrapper> img gets pointer-events:none and you run your draggable functions on the wrapper outside.
[10:43:56] <MassDebates> playing with user-select, I've found at least, typically only solves cosmetic issues for UI
[10:44:12] <MassDebates> you may want to do that too, but that won't be a core solution to your problem with the isolation of the native browser functions with the img.
[10:45:03] <stennowork> pointer-events: none should be the solution, lemme try
[10:45:40] <MassDebates> As a fallback for some of the shit browsers in the past (if you plan on supporting the fledglings, this applies even more-so) you could put a hidden/invisible element with absolute positioning over each image.
[10:46:00] <stennowork> yes, i thought about that too as a worst-case fallback
[10:46:00] <MassDebates> Do keep in mind, if someone WANTS an image from your site, you can't protect it better than a professional watermarking service.
[10:46:14] <stennowork> its not for image protection, its just for functionality
[10:46:27] <stennowork> luckily i only have to support modern browsers
[10:46:28] <MassDebates> Very good. Then that's good.
[10:46:28] <MassDebates> #css is able to help you implement this if you need trouble.
[10:46:33] <hlve> MassDebates,  you keep thinking it's about preventing copying an image, it has nothing to do with that.
[10:46:41] <hlve> lol
[10:46:44] <MassDebates> Fancy dancy! Mobiles?
[10:46:56] <MassDebates> Sorry hive I will stop then
[10:47:00] <MassDebates> hlve* mb
[10:47:04] <hlve> he's said it from the beginning that he was just trying to prevent dragging.
[10:47:28] <hlve> o_o
[10:47:28] <MassDebates> Sometimes people don't always say what they mean. I like repeated (albeit sometimes redundant) clarification.
[10:47:39] <hlve> ^_;
[10:47:57] <MassDebates> I was thinking of the UI the entire time as the priority though, ftr
[10:48:04] <stennowork> hmm
[10:48:26] <stennowork> putting pointer-events: none; doesn't seem to bubble upwards
[10:48:36] <stennowork> i guess i can delegate...
[10:48:53] <MassDebates> It only cascades down, like a scope.
[10:49:15] <hlve> you're a scope
[10:49:17] <hlve> =)
[10:49:58] <MassDebates> I was in your mom's scope last night
[10:50:16] <stennowork> here is the test case https://jsfiddle.net/nq5r63pc/
[10:50:18] <hlve> You poor bastard.
[10:50:59] <hlve> so uhh
[10:51:01] <MassDebates> stennowork:  now remember
[10:51:02] <stennowork> as you can see i cannot drag the image itself via pointer-events: none; as expected, however, the dragstart event isn't fired
[10:51:15] <hlve> dragstart is fired, dragend isn't
[10:51:16] <MassDebates> you're running it on the image, see?
[10:51:50] <stennowork> i hoped that i could delegate the event
[10:52:04] <stennowork> oh hm
[10:52:15] <stennowork> dragstart is triggered indeed, why is it like that all of a sudden
[10:52:17] <stennowork> ah well
[10:52:20] <stennowork> dragend still isn't
[10:52:21] <hlve> lol
[10:52:43] <MassDebates> Theres several issues with the code as I see it.
[10:52:47] <stennowork> eep
[10:52:54] <MassDebates> You should review the code once more
[10:52:54] <MassDebates> and try doing an update
[10:53:15] <stennowork> oh i gave an old code
[10:54:05] <stennowork> hmm user-select: none doesn't prevent the native image dragging
[10:54:13] <MassDebates> er, well it does
[10:54:17] <hlve> i noticed that.
[10:54:20] <MassDebates> er, it should prevent about half of it.
[10:54:30] <MassDebates> Remember, user can still select with the mouse dragging AROUND the image
[10:54:42] <hlve> ah
[10:54:44] <hlve> INTERESTING
[10:54:45] <hlve> one sec
[10:54:47] <MassDebates> once it's highlighted, several major browsers (like torch and chrome are biggest examples from chromium builds)
[10:54:57] <MassDebates> I think at least. Been a while since I played with user interaction cues
[10:55:39] <MassDebates> but your CORE solution, if implemented correctly, can solve that problem in most major browsers. the fledgelings, as I've indicated above, may/may not need that extra tid-bit supplied by hlve
[10:55:48] <MassDebates> Remember to apply the right CSS to the right elements
[10:57:33] <hlve> honestly?
[10:57:42] <hlve> just make a div and give it a background-image with the SRC of the image
[10:57:45] <hlve> boom.
[10:57:48] <hlve> issue. solved.
[10:58:56] <MassDebates> That may cause other issues for him, like SEO
[10:59:03] <MassDebates> (or detriments)
[10:59:07] <MassDebates> But if he doesn't care, I agree with hlve 100%
[10:59:20] <hlve> SEO. Oh I how miss you.
[10:59:36] <hlve> I used to be that douchebag that grayhatted all day
[10:59:39] <MassDebates> I hope you're talking to me and not the abstract concept itself
[10:59:39] <MassDebates> :P
[10:59:53] <hlve> :P
[10:59:58] <MassDebates> I think everyone does a bit here and there
[11:00:07] <MassDebates> Except me, for I am perfect
[11:00:16] <hlve> I wish I was still good at SEO
[11:00:17] * hlve :(
[11:00:37] <stennowork> SEO is irrelevant
[11:00:59] <stennowork> apparently html5 has a 'draggable' attribute but that causes dragstart to not fire in the first place
[11:01:41] <stennowork> i am not sure if i can just a background image because i do funky stuff with resizing and container sizing
[11:01:46] <hlve> stennowork,  but dragend also doesn't work if you put draggable on
[11:01:49] <hlve> er
[11:01:51] <hlve> off*
[11:02:20] <stennowork> hlve, the reason dragend doesn't work in the first place is because i still preventDefault in dragstart
[11:02:25] <MassDebates> background images are often easier to manage than their actual image element counterparts regarding sizing, layout, and other container-based constraints/rules
[11:02:37] <MassDebates> (on the wrong thing, still though)
[11:02:53] <MassDebates> @ stenno's most recent message.
[11:03:33] <MassDebates> stenno, my offer is still open.
[11:03:36] <MassDebates> Just saying.
[11:03:50] <stennowork> i have draggable="false" on my img element
[11:04:58] <MassDebates> Can you link me your most recent fiddle version?
[11:06:03] <stennowork> https://jsfiddle.net/nq5r63pc/3/
[11:12:12] <MassDebates> oh hey sorry
[11:12:16] <MassDebates> didnt notice you replied
[11:12:16] <MassDebates> 2 secs looking
[11:16:11] <stennowork> in the worst case i will just use a transparent overlay and then i don't have these problems
[11:16:21] <stennowork> its not the elegant solution but it Works(tm)
[11:16:51] <MassDebates> i'm back
[11:16:57] <stennowork> i still need click events on the image too
[11:17:01] <stennowork> images*
[11:17:43] <stennowork> in my latest fiddle i have draggable="false" as you can see, which prevents dragstart from firing even
[11:17:50] <MassDebates> hlve 's suggestion still stands as best, make them backgrounds imo
[11:17:59] <stennowork> hrm
[11:18:09] <stennowork> well a pity
[11:18:10] <MassDebates> and you aren't attributing any droppables
[11:18:41] <MassDebates> Since you'll have drag & drop capabilities, i wouldn't be surprised if you're able to make it work so long as there's a destination available, since start works but no end.
[11:18:44] <stennowork> is dropend only fired on droppable area?
[11:19:01] <MassDebates> No
[11:19:05] <MassDebates> But I think there's an anomaly with this
[11:19:09] <MassDebates> Like an edge-case.
[11:19:21] <MassDebates> It may be worth your while to spend 2-4 minutes and test 'er out.
[11:19:41] <MassDebates> If it doesn't work, then you can always pop back to your less than elegant solution, or stick with hlve
[11:29:54] <stennowork> overlay time then
[11:53:55] <ExeciN> Hi, I have this json https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b89e6b5dec7cc367df95f48ca99bd276 how can I get a list of distinct "educational_levels"?
[11:55:07] <robertmaxrees> distinct meaning literally every variation of that object?
[11:55:14] <robertmaxrees> or is value the same per level
[11:55:15] <robertmaxrees> ?
[11:56:33] <ExeciN> only get the distinct inner objects
[11:56:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:56:53] <robertmaxrees> so could you ever havea High School with a value of 4?
[11:57:02] <ExeciN> no
[11:57:11] <robertmaxrees> okay/
[11:57:23] <ExeciN> I could just check if they are the same by their id
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> easy deduped copy of the array.
[11:57:46] <robertmaxrees> do you control where this array comes from?
[11:59:26] <ExeciN> what do you mean if I control it?
[11:59:49] <robertmaxrees> does this data come from somewhere you control?
[11:59:53] <robertmaxrees> do you generate it?
[11:59:54] <ExeciN> ah yes
[12:00:32] <robertmaxrees> then have your server hand over the list of uniques.
[12:00:33] <ExeciN> it is basically a database table dump
[12:00:50] <robertmaxrees> should be relational so you can just get a copy of all the levels or w/e
[12:01:04] <ExeciN> the problem is that I have unique objects with common inner objects
[12:01:32] <ExeciN> I thought of getting the educational_levels alone on another ajax call but I'm trying to minimize my api calls
[12:01:51] <robertmaxrees> right so your database should have a table of just that data/.
[12:01:57] <ExeciN> yes
[12:02:02] <robertmaxrees> and you could either use a second ajax call or justy supply that on pageload.
[12:02:07] <robertmaxrees> since it'll be static.
[12:02:45] <ExeciN> can't I derive the distinct educational_levels from that richer json?
[12:03:08] <robertmaxrees> never said you couldn't, but it's a bad idea to if you can just pull the data directly.
[12:03:36] <ExeciN> but then I'll have to chain my ajax calls
[12:03:44] <ExeciN> so that one happens before the other
[12:04:05] <robertmaxrees> why?
[12:04:18] <robertmaxrees> why not just bundle the two datasets together into one call?
[12:04:37] <robertmaxrees> or even better, include the levels in the actual page instead of via ajax.
[12:04:52] <ExeciN> I'm supposed to populate the educational_levels first and under them, add the titles
[12:05:01] <ExeciN> in the dom
[12:05:12] <robertmaxrees> right, so why do you have to load the levels via ajx?
[12:05:24] <ExeciN> the levels might change in the future
[12:05:34] <robertmaxrees> huh>?
[12:05:42] <robertmaxrees> you're still pulling them from the db on pageload.
[12:05:49] <ExeciN> more educational levels might be added in the database
[12:05:55] <ExeciN> so I want the frontend to be dynamic
[12:06:10] <robertmaxrees> then include them as apart of the same ajax call.
[12:06:18] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're so resistant to making your life easier.
[12:07:58] <ExeciN> the api-spec and the backend will have to be changed.
[12:08:14] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a good change to me :)
[12:08:36] <ExeciN> maybe but I don't want to change it
[12:08:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:08:43] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[12:10:33] <hlve> welp!
[12:10:45] <robertmaxrees> then same answer as before: dedupe and map it into the format you want.
[12:32:06] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:00:43] <MassDebates> hi taplar
[13:00:54] * MassDebates finishes his bowl of taplaroni
[13:00:57] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[13:01:24] <MassDebates> gesundheit
[13:01:34] * MassDebates hands him a tissue
[13:05:59] <MassDebates> So yeah I've got this plugin I've been playing with but it's a bit slow.
[13:06:33] <MassDebates> I think it's because of the dependencies it needs. I'm going to make this a local file, anyways. Dependencies that are a directory or 2 deeper below would fix 80% of the delay, right?
[13:07:05] <MassDebates> at least that's what Google's oracle known as the "network" tab claims.
[13:07:13] <MassDebates> Is there anything else I can do?
[13:07:25] <taplar> what is the delay?
[13:07:30] <taplar> network transfer?
[13:08:44] <MassDebates> That's what I think it is. I see the bars on the tab and they look like assholes.
[13:08:52] <MassDebates> I'ma try it and run a zip
[13:08:52] <MassDebates> brb
[13:09:08] <MassDebates> yes, they are.
[13:09:08] <taplar> how big is the file, are you allowing for compression, and are you allowing for caching?
[13:09:28] <MassDebates> There's about 8
[13:09:32] <MassDebates> 2 secs, I'm getting a tally up
[13:10:20] <MassDebates> Each of them are less than a megabyte.
[13:10:24] <MassDebates> hovering around 36kb eac
[13:10:36] <MassDebates> Some are like 4kb, I could combine and condense
[13:10:42] <taplar> i wouldn't think that would be too bad.  what's the total time?
[13:11:00] <MassDebates> Well codepen's got something to do with it too, i'm sure.
[13:11:43] <MassDebates> hm, and a broken modernizr link
[13:12:47] <MassDebates> yick, 4 seconds after fixing links
[13:13:03] <MassDebates> I'ma export and deploy a zip on a tablet and see what happens.
[13:14:43] <taplar> i've thought about combining my vendor scripts and my personal scripts, i just haven't changed my gulp to do that yet.  should be safe for me at the moment as none of my js relies on being in a specific url path
[13:14:43] <taplar> 4 seconds to load all the scripts?
[13:15:30] <taplar> i still have to figure out why my latest refactoring broke my page on blackberry, :(
[13:17:44] <MassDebates> yeah I'm playing on cp before i go to gulp
[13:19:31] <taplar> cp?
[13:21:26] <MassDebates> codepen
[13:21:46] <taplar> codepen does project builds?
[13:22:29] <MassDebates> Er, well
[13:22:37] <MassDebates> I mean, -technically- you could but I'm sure they wouldn't want that lol
[13:22:52] <MassDebates> I'm just playing with a ported case atm
[13:23:08] <MassDebates> I'll have gulp do this stuff automatically for me because screw work
[13:23:20] <MassDebates> I dont work often but when I do
[13:23:20] <MassDebates> It's XX
[13:25:22] <ExeciN> I'm having a loop that is supposed to have several iterations but I'm getting just one instead. what am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/865cf74d79984721f0da8c4b09c02e09
[13:26:02] <taplar> why do you think there is only one iteration?
[13:27:04] <ExeciN> line 6 should have been executed 16 times. this is how many objects are in my json array
[13:27:14] <robertmaxrees>  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cLboqkj5/1/
[13:27:15] <robertmaxrees> for a fiddle.
[13:27:24] <robertmaxrees> and extend seems like thje wrong choice here.
[13:27:35] <taplar> are you expecting extend to turn the object into an array?
[13:27:56] <taplar> cause afaik it's just a merge of sorts
[13:28:01] <taplar> which would overlay
[13:28:27] <ExeciN> doesn't it add the second object to the first one?
[13:28:33] <taplar> merge
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:28:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cLboqkj5/2/
[13:28:59] <taplar> { 'a': 1 } + { 'b': 2 } = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> map and dedupe yp
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> *yo
[13:29:25] <sillyslux> extend is this? https://github.com/dfilatov/jquery-plugins/blob/master/src/jquery.debounce/jquery.debounce.js
[13:29:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:29:39] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/
[13:29:55] <sillyslux> i meant that as a usage example
[13:30:09] <sillyslux> (function($) {$.extend({
[13:30:16] <robertmaxrees> that's one way to do it, yeah.
[13:30:28] <ExeciN> robertmaxrees: it works but I don't understand why
[13:30:41] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN that example doesn't fully do what you wnat.
[13:30:46] <robertmaxrees> but it's a place to start.
[13:31:26] <MassDebates> oi rob
[13:31:27] <MassDebates> is build yours?
[13:31:33] <robertmaxrees> "mine"?
[13:31:44] <robertmaxrees> i work there, yes.
[13:31:50] <MassDebates> have you touched it?
[13:31:53] <robertmaxrees> the site?
[13:31:54] <MassDebates> Ah, cool!
[13:32:02] <MassDebates> aye
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, alone with dozens of other people >.>
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> *along
[13:32:29] <MassDebates> Damn, was gonna make so many jokes from that one
[13:32:31] <ExeciN> oh wait are you getting in field's array?
[13:32:39] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN huh?
[13:33:13] <robertmaxrees> ExeciN .map() generates a new array.  meant to transform data from one format to another.
[13:35:51] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates why do you ask?
[13:36:45] <taplar> field of dreams joke?
[13:37:36] <ExeciN> oh I get it now (not the joke)
[13:37:49] <taplar> :o
[13:38:01] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[13:40:03] <ExeciN> will unique work with my object's elements? or is it strictly for dom elements?
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> what unique?
[13:40:23] <robertmaxrees> the jquery one?
[13:41:13] <ExeciN> I mean .uniqueSort
[13:41:16] <ExeciN> yeah
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> "sorts an array of DOM elements, in place, with the duplicates removed. Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers.
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> seems pretty clear-cut to me.
[13:41:16] <robertmaxrees> just search the googs for how to dedupe an array
[13:41:39] <ExeciN> oh
[13:43:33] <taplar> http://lmgtfy.com/?s=d&q=mdn%2C+Array.prototype
[13:43:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:43:57] <taplar> they do more than google now.  awesome, :D
[13:45:04] <Captain_Ramius> Hey guys. Anyone worked with printing barcode labels?
[13:45:24] <ExeciN> Captain_Ramius: you can probably get away with it with a font
[13:45:32] <taplar> i have, but only on special printers
[13:45:32] <taplar> datamax and pt540s
[13:45:32] <Captain_Ramius> I have most of the "parts" but I can't fit them together.
[13:45:41] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius mind clarifying what you're asking for help with?
[13:46:10] <Captain_Ramius> Sure. I am ramping up an eBay store and the only way to keep it from flying apart is to track each item with a unique ID.
[13:46:14] <MassDebates> POSs have come a long way in terms of standardization and UPCs are more commonly interpreted than ever
[13:46:26] <MassDebates> Running a unique identifier is easy so long as you have the ability to program the labeler.
[13:46:29] <Captain_Ramius> Hence, barcodes on labels that we scan.
[13:46:47] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting stuck>
[13:46:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:46:58] <MassDebates> Are you doing this completely digital or with concrete media?
[13:47:00] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're building some order management stuff.
[13:47:03] <sillyslux> ejavu
[13:47:03] <taplar> upcs have had standards for a long time
[13:47:06] <MassDebates> Sorry, i'll back out.
[13:47:07] <sillyslux> +d
[13:47:09] <Captain_Ramius> robertmaxrees, exactly.
[13:47:22] <MassDebates> taplar:  you calling me old, bruh?
[13:47:23] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius alright - so what do you need help with exactly?
[13:47:29] <Captain_Ramius> MassDebates, i don't quite follow your question.
[13:47:34] <taplar> *shrug*
[13:47:35] <Captain_Ramius> Here's what I have so far:
[13:47:46] <Captain_Ramius> barcode.php from davidscotttufts.com
[13:47:56] <Captain_Ramius> generates a simple image
[13:48:09] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:48:28] <Captain_Ramius> but how do I print an image with the text underneath?
[13:48:40] <sillyslux> haha
[13:48:50] <sillyslux> sounds more like #css question
[13:48:54] <robertmaxrees> not even.
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> 100% i wouldn't use a browser for this.
[13:49:04] <robertmaxrees> generate a PDF.
[13:49:37] <Captain_Ramius> I agree. No need to display the barcode, simply to print it in the background when, for example, a button is clicked.
[13:49:45] <sillyslux> how would you create the layout?
[13:49:52] <sillyslux> css sounds very fitting for this
[13:49:58] <sillyslux> at least to me
[13:50:14] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux controlling printer output from a browser is something i'd avoid as much as possiblke.
[13:50:25] <robertmaxrees> especially when you're relying on something like barcodes.
[13:50:27] <sillyslux> node
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:50:45] <sillyslux> but... why not browser?
[13:50:46] <taplar> pdfs can also handle scaling better i'd assume
[13:50:55] <Captain_Ramius> what about this FPDF addon? http://www.fpdf.org/en/script/script29.php
[13:51:00] <Captain_Ramius> "This class allows to print labels easily in any format (AVERY or custom)."
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux browsers + printers is a shaky proposition.
[13:51:19] <sillyslux> dunno...
[13:51:34] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i don't know php but that's where i'd put my effort Captain_Ramius
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> avoid printing labels from the browser.  that sort of stuff goes really poorly.
[13:52:07] <Captain_Ramius> FWIW, I would be willing to drop a little cash on a pre-packaged app, but I can't find one and (famous last words) "how hard could it be?"
[13:52:27] <sillyslux> i had a printer, once. i even used it sometimes and i created labels too. i used some office suite for that iirc
[13:52:55] <taplar> we use custom printers for creating tickets.  doing so requires coding in the logic that those printers understands.
[13:53:07] <Captain_Ramius> If I can figure out the basic code outline, I think I can connect the links of the chain.
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius yeah, you want the backend here, not the in-browser side.
[13:53:24] <Captain_Ramius> taplar, that sounds messy.
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius that's where you wind up eventually :)
[13:54:13] <robertmaxrees> unless you pay money for a prepackaged system.
[13:54:26] <taplar> it's not simple, no.  but it is exact
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> our returns system used to use an activex app.  those were the days.
[13:54:57] <Captain_Ramius> I picture it going: Click button, run barcode generator with arguments, create PDF, and then what?
[13:54:57] <taplar> would probably be easier if when i did it i didn't have to do it once in a blue moon so i had to remember every thing.
[13:54:58] <sillyslux> custom printers come as prepackaged systems, don't they?
[13:55:06] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: the find line from that code last night doesn't work, because i think the page on which i'm using it is nesting the html differently than fiddle
[13:55:54] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux you're conflating "home printing" with "shipping label business printing"
[13:55:58] <robertmaxrees> two VERY different worlds.
[13:56:03] <taplar> :)
[13:56:13] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider i'ma be honest and say that I had a VERY long day yesterday, very little of whcih i remember.
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius you'll need you'll need to store the ID in your DB somewhere.
[13:57:12] <Captain_Ramius> robertmaxrees, it's already there. That part of the program is stable.
[13:57:15] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: do you remember going on a liam neeson-like violent quest in europe for your missing daughter, which included a lot of brutal killings?
[13:57:30] <robertmaxrees> bjsnider newp.  doesn't mean it didn't happen ;)
[13:57:34] <Captain_Ramius> We used to sell on Amazon primarily, but it's getting shaky for non-technical reasons.
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius financial?
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> they pushing you to pricing that isn't... favorable?
[13:57:59] <sillyslux> i thought if i puchase a custom printer, that would be quite businessy and i'd get all the software with it
[13:58:07] <Captain_Ramius> Short story: we buy, inspect, and sell store returns.
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius ah
[13:58:18] <sillyslux> well anyway
[13:58:28] <Captain_Ramius> We can't prove that they're "real" because we don't buy from a distributor. Word of the day is Provenance.
[13:58:32] <sillyslux> short story, it all comes down to the printer
[13:58:50] <Captain_Ramius> So other sellers and even manufacturers complain that ours must be fake because we didn't buy from the right source.
[13:58:51] <robertmaxrees> and how you interface with it sillyslux
[13:58:58] <sillyslux> rs232
[13:59:06] <sillyslux> parallel port
[13:59:06] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius yuck.
[13:59:11] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux lol
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> you're really stuck on this.
[13:59:17] <sillyslux> :p
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm just going off my experience.  but what would i know?
[13:59:33] <Captain_Ramius> robertmaxrees, it's all in optimizing the workflow and finding a conducive marketplace.
[13:59:34] <sillyslux> yeah i should do other things but i don't want to
[13:59:52] <Captain_Ramius> My jerry-rigged PHP app took our processing from 8 hours per lot (80-100 items) to less than 4 hours.
[13:59:56] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius yep - i work in ecom.  i know the game :)
[14:00:33] <Captain_Ramius> I should've remembered that. You helped me before when I was getting pummelled by some jQuery method.
[14:00:41] <sillyslux> ah now i remember a work place where we had a label printer with barcodes on it, 2*3 cm stickers
[14:00:43] <bjsnider> sillyslux: do you use an adapter for the computer side of the parallel cable?
[14:01:01] <sillyslux> sometimes 1m came out that was 50% off
[14:01:25] <sillyslux> hey my last printer is 1kkm away
[14:01:28] <Captain_Ramius> So is there any way to auto print a PDF that is generated on my webhost server out in Timbuktu?
[14:01:31] <sillyslux> 1000km
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius server-side, sure.
[14:01:45] <sillyslux> and it weights 25kg
[14:01:46] <robertmaxrees> i would imagine at least
[14:01:47] <Captain_Ramius> ?
[14:02:05] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius unless that php file already prints for you.
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> or does it just generate the pdf?
[14:02:18] <Captain_Ramius> just makes the pdf
[14:02:32] <Captain_Ramius> But that's the standard for printing labels, from what I gather.
[14:02:32] <robertmaxrees> then see if there's a way php can call your printer with a particualr file.
[14:02:42] <sillyslux> with linux you can easily automate things
[14:02:52] <robertmaxrees> same with windows or any other OS ;)
[14:03:01] <Captain_Ramius> But they have to be connected right?
[14:03:08] <Captain_Ramius> Maybe http://php.net/manual/fa/function.printer-open.php
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius printer?
[14:03:28] <Captain_Ramius> I have Ubuntu based (actually Elementary OS), Mac, and Windows at work.
[14:03:48] <robertmaxrees> you'd need the print server accessible somewhere.
[14:04:03] <Captain_Ramius> It's a network shared printer.
[14:04:15] <robertmaxrees> can your webserver access it?
[14:04:21] <Captain_Ramius> That link is a bust though: the bread crumbs show "Windows Only Extensions"
[14:04:57] <Captain_Ramius> I don't know if my webserver can access it. It's a shared hosting plan: I doubt they have many extra features.
[14:05:06] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be your problem.
[14:05:08] <Captain_Ramius> What about JS window.print()?
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> that's shaky.
[14:05:19] <Captain_Ramius> Would that open the tedious print dialog every time?
[14:05:21] <robertmaxrees> because that prints the wondow.
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> and yes, you'd get the dialog.
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> do you have an in-office server you can use for print jobs?
[14:05:50] <sillyslux> place the files somewhere locally and run a cron job every now and then
[14:06:04] <Captain_Ramius> When we first started printing labels for Amazon, my Java buddy and I tried to make a VB script to auto print any PDF in a given folder. We couldn't get it to separate shipping labels and item labels though.
[14:06:08] <robertmaxrees> because you could setup a simple watcher that keeps an eye on a particular directory and prints files that get placed there.
[14:06:13] <Captain_Ramius> no in-office server
[14:06:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> then you're looking at something pretty painful.
[14:06:35] <Captain_Ramius> sillyslux, I thought of that. I just learned cron to auto back up my app's DB every hour.
[14:07:05] <Captain_Ramius> A cron scheduled Bash script would do that wouldn't it?
[14:07:07] <robertmaxrees> you'll be looking to create a client-side app for that.
[14:07:09] <sillyslux> but then again, there some command... something like ps i think
[14:07:18] <sillyslux> that would do it directly
[14:07:24] <sillyslux> *not ps
[14:07:26] <sillyslux> :D
[14:07:35] <Captain_Ramius> So what if  we generate the PDF, save it to the server, and tell teh bash script where to find it?
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius you'd need to save it to the machine locally.
[14:07:49] <Captain_Ramius> Could I background print a PDF from a given URL?
[14:07:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:07:58] <Captain_Ramius> :-(
[14:08:04] <Captain_Ramius> Local save then.
[14:08:15] <sillyslux> ?
[14:08:18] <robertmaxrees> save the pdf locally, have a watcher kick off print jobs as they come in.
[14:08:19] <Captain_Ramius> So auto-download after it's generated
[14:08:29] <robertmaxrees> you're going to get that save dialog though.
[14:08:37] <robertmaxrees> like, if you're doing this via browsers, you're going to get dialogs.
[14:08:38] <Captain_Ramius> But we have guys working on different OS.
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:08:47] <sillyslux> you can curl the pdf from remote and move then to the printer directly with bash
[14:08:47] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have to support each one.
[14:08:59] <Captain_Ramius> What if I save to Dropbox or something that can share with the Linux machine running a cron/bash?
[14:09:05] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> now you're relying on dropbox.
[14:09:15] <Captain_Ramius> "yeesh" what?
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> can you just have a dedicated linux box for this?
[14:09:37] <Captain_Ramius> Sure. They're always on anyway.
[14:09:48] <Captain_Ramius> does sillyslux 's curl idea make sense?
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> an actual in-office server?
[14:10:00] <sillyslux> or just any box
[14:10:02] <Captain_Ramius> I have plenty of extra machines.
[14:10:02] <robertmaxrees> not just somebody's machine.
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, use one of those.
[14:10:25] <Captain_Ramius> I was going to host my PHP app in-house but didn't want that responsibility. I know zip on sysadmin.
[14:10:40] <robertmaxrees> have webserver save PDFs to directory.
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> hit linux box via simple API where you feed it a url to the pdf.
[14:11:02] <robertmaxrees> linux box fetches via curl.
[14:11:08] <robertmaxrees> then sends to print server.
[14:11:24] <Captain_Ramius> Sorry, did you say "simply API"?
[14:11:32] <robertmaxrees> simple
[14:11:41] <robertmaxrees> as in, make a simple webapp with a simple api call.
[14:11:53] <Captain_Ramius> You keep using that word...
[14:12:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:12:00] <sillyslux> so that curl can download
[14:12:08] <Captain_Ramius> ROFL
[14:12:10] <robertmaxrees> it's easier than you'd think :)
[14:12:25] <Captain_Ramius> (You know how long I've been waiting to say that to someone?)
[14:12:26] <robertmaxrees> and it's something you'll need to learn to do.  otherwise, just buy something off the shelf.
[14:12:31] <sillyslux> does it have to be protected?
[14:12:46] <Captain_Ramius> sillyslux, no, if someone stumbles on it, it's meaningless
[14:12:52] <sillyslux> so
[14:13:14] <Captain_Ramius> I think that's workable.
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> stumbles on which box?
[14:13:24] <sillyslux> just put it in an accessible directory in /var/www and your local linux box can curl from there
[14:13:29] <robertmaxrees> oh the PDFs?
[14:13:53] <sillyslux> otherwise do it with ssh
[14:13:57] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:13:59] <sillyslux> just as easy
[14:14:01] <sillyslux> almost
[14:14:03] <Captain_Ramius> stumbles on the webserver file
[14:15:44] <Captain_Ramius> You said, "hit linux box via simple API"?
[14:15:55] <Captain_Ramius> Is there a reason to push the PDF instead of pulling it?
[14:16:02] <robertmaxrees> you are pulling it.
[14:16:08] <robertmaxrees> from the internal box.
[14:16:14] <Captain_Ramius> OK.
[14:16:17] <robertmaxrees> don't use a scheduled task.
[14:16:47] <Captain_Ramius> Can you elaborate on the hitting part?
[14:17:03] <Captain_Ramius> How does the internal box know what to get?
[14:17:03] <sillyslux> it's push vs pull
[14:17:15] <robertmaxrees> exactly what i said earlier :)
[14:17:35] <robertmaxrees> so your internal box will have an API that'll accept the URI for the pdf.
[14:17:50] <robertmaxrees> could use ajax for it if you really wanted.
[14:18:03] <robertmaxrees> hitting that url then tells a basic webapp on that box to go fetch that PDF.
[14:19:15] <Captain_Ramius> So the web server would call "internalbox.com/api/newlabel.pdf" and that would be like passing an argument to the internal fetching app?
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:19:36] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> you'd tell your webserver "make me this PDF"
[14:19:53] <robertmaxrees> it passes back the PDF name or whatever.
[14:20:05] <robertmaxrees> you then take that info and hit your internal machine, telling it the name.
[14:20:11] <robertmaxrees> it then uses curl to go fetch it.
[14:20:41] <Captain_Ramius> OK, like "Your file is ready for download and can be found here: <URL>"
[14:20:47] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[14:20:53] <Captain_Ramius> Interesting...
[14:21:45] <Captain_Ramius> This is going to stretch me a bit but I expect it will be enlightening.
[14:21:47] <robertmaxrees> if you're really into cron jobs i guess you could put them in the folder and then that internal box fetches them at some regular interval.  i've never liked that idea because they always seem to fall apart.
[14:21:54] <robertmaxrees> probably FUD on my part.
[14:22:46] <Captain_Ramius> If I do a cron job, though, I have to sort the old ones from the new ones.
[14:23:00] <robertmaxrees> aye.
[14:23:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd still keep record of that stuff somewhere.
[14:23:22] <Captain_Ramius> but I can say, "only print the ones created in the last X seconds"
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> that's error-prone tbh.
[14:24:00] <sillyslux> not if it's done right :)
[14:24:12] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't rely on timestamps.
[14:24:13] <Captain_Ramius> Well, the UX has to be slick though. It has to be: User clicks the button and the label prints out.
[14:24:15] <robertmaxrees> tbh.
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:24:26] <sillyslux> no incoming folder
[14:24:33] <robertmaxrees> thats where the cron job gets stanky.
[14:24:34] <sillyslux> no, incoming folder
[14:24:38] <robertmaxrees> it won't be "basically" instant.
[14:24:40] <Captain_Ramius> Cron seems too loose for this case.
[14:24:57] <Captain_Ramius> I can be direct and instantaneous with the URL
[14:25:23] <Captain_Ramius> User doesn't care how many scripts or machines are involved. User just wants the result.
[14:25:39] <sillyslux> or with ssh, but then you'd have your ssl key on some remote machine
[14:26:46] <sillyslux> http indeed seems the way to go (to me)
[14:27:02] <sillyslux> you could ask in ##linux what they think
[14:27:24] <Captain_Ramius> Thanks a lot for the help guys.
[14:27:57] <Captain_Ramius> I'm going to chew on this for a bit. My only concern is that we need it ASAP and I don't want to bungee cord this thing together.
[14:27:59] <sillyslux> that's been 1hr and no result yet
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius i'd just buy the pre-built solution tbh.
[14:28:23] <sillyslux> start with bungee
[14:28:41] <sillyslux> then you have something to look at or to really chew on
[14:29:17] <sillyslux> oh and if it's critical and your not sure... have somebody else do it
[14:29:49] <Captain_Ramius> robertmaxrees, I'm not opposed, if the cost is minimal. I just haven't found ity et.
[14:29:50] <sillyslux> or pre-built or whatever
[14:30:04] <robertmaxrees> Captain_Ramius be careful with that "minimal" stuff.
[14:30:09] <robertmaxrees> look for something decent.
[14:30:20] <Captain_Ramius> *cost is affordable
[14:30:21] <robertmaxrees> because this system will need to be able to grow for a little while.
[14:31:21] <sillyslux> and you don't want to come in the morning and see all those expensive label sheet on the floor with some bot/spide/websomething text on it
[14:32:11] <sillyslux> hah i'll try to continue my things now :/
[14:32:40] <Captain_Ramius> True. Thanks again.
[14:33:02] <sillyslux> oh i'm wake 36hrs! huh :8
[14:33:27] <sillyslux> hmmm
[14:38:17] <bjsnider> that code from last night was just in the wrong place. where does fiddle run its code in relation to the html? i checked the source and i can't see
[14:38:44] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[14:54:48] <robertmaxrees> oonts oonts oonts
[14:57:59] <Alturic> Hey guys, I'm trying to make a .click open a modal, and then inside of the model there's two buttons that I want to handle a .click on them to perform two seperate actions. What would be the best approach to get around having to play with (seemingly impossible) nested .clicks?
[14:58:34] <robertmaxrees> delegated listeners
[14:58:35] <Alturic> model=modal
[15:04:24] <Alturic> So I'd make the parent .click delegated to or?
[15:04:35] <Alturic> too*
[15:05:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd delegate all of 'em yeah.
[15:20:08] <Alturic> robertmaxrees: If I set the data attr using .attr('data-foo') in the the first .click and then have a click outside of the first one, can it read the data attr?
[15:20:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:20:24] <robertmaxrees> also: use .data()
[15:20:42] <robertmaxrees> you mean - can you read and write a data attribute outside of the place you set it?
[15:20:43] <Alturic> Well, I read something about if you set it after the pageload it doesn't get the new value?
[15:20:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:20:50] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[15:21:01] <robertmaxrees> tyou just always read and write with .data()
[15:21:07] <robertmaxrees> the html doesn't update, but that's good.
[15:21:11] <robertmaxrees> it's faster that way
[15:21:13] <Alturic> I typically do, but in this case, yea.
[15:21:19] <Alturic> Oh really, so it still updates the object.
[15:21:22] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:21:28] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[15:21:36] <robertmaxrees> yes, you can read out of a different handler.
[15:21:37] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[15:22:14] <Alturic> Anyway, I couldn't get it to work with nested .clicks, so I figure I could have the primary .click which opens the model, set a .data on a button inside the modal. Then I could have a .click for that button completely outside of the primary click.
[15:22:21] <Alturic> That also doesn't seem to work. :-/
[15:26:02] <Alturic> Hmm, I might have it. I had to put the secondary .click inside a document.ready.
[15:26:46] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:26:49] <delinquentme> Hi all. I've got a Highchart in which I've created a setInterval() in ... I've assigned it the name bingoBongo ... and I'd like to have control over destroying it using jquery.  http://jsfiddle.net/9k3cw1uv/
[15:26:58] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you delegating Alturic?
[15:27:16] <delinquentme> Is it best to access this through the highcharts object with $("#container").highcharts()  or using another way?
[15:27:54] <Alturic> robertmaxrees I couldn't get it to work. :-/
[15:28:03] <robertmaxrees> Alturic then let's get it working! :)
[15:28:06] <Alturic> ha
[15:28:09] <robertmaxrees> delegtion is easy :)
[15:28:17] <Alturic> Is it proper practice to delegate most things?
[15:28:30] <Alturic> Or are you referring to delegating AND nesting the .clicks?
[15:28:35] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:28:38] <robertmaxrees> delegate both.
[15:28:41] <robertmaxrees> never nest event handlers.
[15:29:40] <Alturic> Am I completely wrong in assuming delegating is nothing more than changing $('.change_default_loc').click(function() {    to   $('.change_default_loc').on('click', 'button', function() {  ?
[15:30:05] <robertmaxrees> not completely, but you are wrong :)
[15:30:25] <Alturic> Now, in this case, the button is one literal button so I could use id for it, but all of the a elements that would pop the modal would need to use the class.
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> $(parentThatExists).on('event', 'theChild', function() {});
[15:30:39] <Alturic> ooooooh
[15:30:56] <Alturic> Man, why couldn't the jquery docs use literal words like that. lol
[15:31:07] <robertmaxrees> they do.
[15:31:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:31:29] <Alturic> Maybe at the very top, in the example they show #list and a. Guess I'll read closer. :P
[15:31:48] <Alturic> Or not. https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ Is what I was using.
[15:32:00] <Alturic> Perhaps I should hit the actual docs instead of the learn.
[15:32:03] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:32:56] <alaing> event delegation is awesome
[15:33:10] <Alturic> alaing: I'm finding. :P
[15:33:29] <alaing> you can create and use your own events too
[15:33:44] <robertmaxrees> sure, though be careful when doing that :3
[15:34:17] <Alturic> And it's totally normal and acceptable that data attr's won't update, but the actual object "updates", as in it's hidden?
[15:34:46] <robertmaxrees> .data() accesses a cached version of the attributes, which is safer for older browsers and faster.
[15:34:57] <Alturic> I have seen data attr's update like data-open="true" and data-open="false" and they do actually update.
[15:35:15] <Alturic> Perhaps it's me simply misremembering and it was just classes, but anyway.
[15:35:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:35:29] <Alturic> Well thank you for showing that to me robertmaxrees. I appreciate it. :)
[15:35:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely.
[15:36:42] <Alturic> Anything I should look out for if data isn't updating or is that what you're saying, I might not be able to see it, but .data('foo', 'bar) would always update (internally) by passing a future .data('foo', 'bar2') ?
[15:37:14] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[15:37:20] <robertmaxrees> you can read it using .data()
[15:37:28] <robertmaxrees> but the document itself doesn't update.
[17:01:01] <robertmaxrees> hekcuva day
[17:05:03] <bjsnider> is it possible to take this: https://jsfiddle.net/th23mn8v/ and test for the selected value, showing the div, and also add the hide class whenever the selection changes?
[17:05:15] <bjsnider> that line isn't working, adding hide
[17:05:48] <MassDebates> if this is just for learning purposes, yes
[17:05:56] <MassDebates> but you may want to consider just pulling instead of testing for a value
[17:06:07] <robertmaxrees> .next() just grabs the next element.
[17:06:13] <robertmaxrees> in this case, .number1
[17:06:27] <MassDebates> Probably would be a good idea if i clicked the link tho 2secs
[17:07:19] <robertmaxrees> any way you cran wrap those divs in a shared element or something?
[17:08:30] <bjsnider> robertmaxrees: sure can bruh
[17:08:47] <robertmaxrees> then you can .next() to that, then .find()
[17:11:03] <bjsnider> cool. that makes the hides work, but how about showing the selected value prior to change?
[17:11:13] <robertmaxrees> "prior to change"?
[17:11:28] <robertmaxrees> you men before the first run>?
[17:11:34] <robertmaxrees> do that server-side to set the default properly.
[17:13:51] <MassDebates> Our men are always before the first run.
[17:14:40] <bjsnider> i mean, there's already a selected value but the div isn't showing, because the jquery code only tests for a change
[17:14:45] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:14:55] <robertmaxrees> the page should have the correct one selected by default.
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> instead of reling on js to fix the displayt.
[17:15:47] <bjsnider> it's hidden because there's no code to remove the hide class
[17:15:57] <robertmaxrees> again
[17:16:02] <robertmaxrees> your server-side code should handle this part.
[17:16:16] <robertmaxrees> not the js.
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> render things out correctly
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> the idea is that the page loads with the correct default state, so your server leaves off that hide class from whichever element.
[17:19:23] <bjsnider> yeah, i could use php to add the hide class to the other divs
[17:19:34] <robertmaxrees> that's really what you want for pageload.
[17:20:28] <MassDebates> What about that, huh bjsnider!? Just like a mechanic! You come in for #jquery and you're given a bunch of ##php ! D'ohohohoh.
[17:20:37] <MassDebates> Sounds like my subway visit today.
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:20:48] <bjsnider> i'm stronger on php at the moment anyway
[17:20:55] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[17:20:58] <bjsnider> i just need hte jscript to pretty thiings up
[17:21:21] <MassDebates> Good. rob was giving you the right solution.
[17:21:27] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[17:21:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:22:20] <bjsnider> how about js?
[17:24:48] <robertmaxrees> or js.
[17:24:59] <robertmaxrees> jscript is what microsoft used to call their version of javascript.
[17:27:48] <bjsnider> is that right?
[17:28:04] <robertmaxrees> is what right?
[17:28:11] <bjsnider> didn't know that
[17:28:34] <bjsnider> do they still have a special name for it?
[17:28:51] <robertmaxrees> last i checked nope.
[17:29:02] <robertmaxrees> it was a licensing concern iirc.
[17:32:00] <bjsnider> what do you fellows think of that book "eloquent javascript"?
[17:32:20] <robertmaxrees> i've heard good things.
[18:17:03] <z1haze> I have a tiny template im going to inject into a page.. but i have the template set in a variable like var template = ` html here .... `; and i want to be able to inject variables into each template at certain places.. can i do this without a plugin/framework?
[18:17:30] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[18:17:39] <robertmaxrees> are you able to use es2015?
[18:22:01] <z1haze> i guess i could
[18:22:11] <z1haze> thats the new es6 stuff right?
[18:22:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.  and you need to be using babel or something if you want to use those featurtes.
[18:22:36] <robertmaxrees> *features
[18:22:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll need to do some kind of basic templating.
[18:22:53] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/3RHWWFS this is basically what i have now which its working how i want, but i dont really havea way to inject data to each template
[18:24:22] <z1haze> and i can pull babel in np
[18:24:44] <robertmaxrees> even easier.
[18:25:14] <robertmaxrees> what bits to you want to replace?
[18:25:44] <verax5> Guys I have several inputs with data-id attribute. How can I get the id of button that was clicked?
[18:26:07] <robertmaxrees> $(this).data('id') inside of your handler verax5
[18:26:53] <z1haze> i want to add some data-attr but you know what i think i can get around it
[18:26:59] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[18:27:21] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/07b5c14e0ca8
[18:27:24] <robertmaxrees> can basically do this
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> easy-peasy
[18:28:24] <verax5> :O
[18:28:30] <verax5> i have to use .each metho?
[18:28:32] <verax5> method*
[18:28:41] <robertmaxrees> verax5 huh?
[18:28:48] <z1haze> ah i never thought of that, thanks that is easy
[18:28:49] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted the clicked one.
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> verax5 make a fiddle.
[18:29:43] <verax5> yeah lol
[18:29:47] <verax5> lemme try ones again :D
[18:30:07] <verax5> wassup a1haere :)
[19:30:42] <iDentity1337> Hello. I'm having a bit of trouble here. I have an object with one 'key-value' item and 3 objects inside that object. How can I iterate through these objects with $.each while avoiding that 'key-value' item?
[19:30:58] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what it looks like?
[19:31:08] <iDentity1337> sec
[19:31:26] <iDentity1337> http://93.180.114.164/api/cont/getComments/6
[19:32:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8eao9379/
[19:32:21] <iDentity1337> When I iterate the whole response with $.each, I get 5-6 typeErrors for undefined.
[19:32:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:32:38] <robertmaxrees> any way you can restructure this a bit?
[19:33:00] <iDentity1337> well I have back-end access but what do you directly mean by restructuring?
[19:33:43] <robertmaxrees> so you have this "broj_komentara" prop and then what should be an array.
[19:33:54] <iDentity1337> yeah
[19:34:07] <robertmaxrees> so why not use an array instead?
[19:34:34] <iDentity1337> hmm...
[19:34:56] <robertmaxrees> something like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8eao9379/1/
[19:35:19] <iDentity1337> i like the way you think, sir.
[19:35:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:35:32] <robertmaxrees> then you just get my_array out of there and call it a day ;)
[19:36:11] <iDentity1337> so, this?
[19:36:11] <iDentity1337> http://93.180.114.164/api/cont/getComments/6
[19:36:29] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[19:37:33] <iDentity1337> and now $.each(response.komentari, function(index) ...) ?
[19:42:18] <iDentity1337> Works flawless, robertmaxrees, thank you. Have a good day/night :D
[19:42:29] <iDentity1337> Also I learnt something today xD
[19:48:11] * taplar watches cspan
[19:48:19] <taplar> i like when guys have tons of charts
[19:52:56] <sadtaco> Erg... how can a do a bunch of operations in parralel really easily?  Like I have a bunch of fields with indices that I need to change. For example, changing 7 to 8 and 8 to 7.  If I do one then the other than both 7 and 8 get changed to 7.
[19:53:19] <sadtaco> I know I can select all the elements that need to be changed and THEN change them, but that'll be annoying to code as opposed to doing something in parralel
[19:54:17] <taplar> why?
[19:54:33] <taplar> 'that'll be annoying' that is
[19:55:14] <sadtaco> Because I'll need to use a hash or something to store the values instead of doing something functional.
[19:56:04] <taplar> i don't understand.  the field indice has what it currently is, yes?
[19:56:38] <sadtaco> Yes. And I'm selecting by what is in the field, which gets changed in sequence
[19:57:07] <taplar> i'd need to see an example of what you are wanting to do.  it really sounds like you are making it sound harder than it should be
[19:57:25] <sadtaco> I thought that was a really simple and intuitive explanation.
[19:57:53] <taplar> 'fields with indices' is very vague
[19:58:13] <sadtaco> It's the value in the field.
[19:58:37] <taplar> so, what, you have like a bunch of input fields with their value being the 'indices' ?
[19:58:49] <sadtaco> yes.
[19:58:57] <sadtaco> They are numbers.
[19:59:17] <taplar> ok, so then your wanting to flip the indice of two sets of numbers or something?
[19:59:51] <sadtaco> No.  A number can appear more than once.  Flipping two fields to be each other is obviously very simple.
[20:00:33] <taplar> ok, so what exactly then?
[20:00:37] <sadtaco> ...
[20:00:48] <sadtaco> You have the numbers 7 and 8 in many different fields
[20:01:03] <sadtaco> If you change all those 7s to 8s, and then you want to change what was 8 to 7, think about it and the problem that happens.
[20:01:14] <taplar> not hard at all
[20:02:15] <sadtaco> YES I KNOW I can use a hash or .data() or something like that to pend what something should be changed to for them all then change them.  But that's a pain in the ass, a lot slower, and so on. Yes, it's simple in concept.   I would figure there's some other way.
[20:04:02] <taplar> so you got something like this right? https://jsfiddle.net/vkgjso2e/  and you want to change 7s to 8s and 8s to 7s, ra?
[20:04:04] <taplar> *ya
[20:05:41] <sadtaco> Right.
[20:06:02] <sadtaco> I can put the new number it should change to in .data() or something, and push all to update in an array, then loop over the array doing the actual work.
[20:06:13] <sadtaco> But that just seems like shitty code tbf.
[20:07:10] <sadtaco> Or a hash of all the ones to change and their new value then iterating over that. Slightly less shitty code but still obtuse.
[20:10:05] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vkgjso2e/1/
[20:13:57] <taplar> more dynamic https://jsfiddle.net/vkgjso2e/2/
[20:14:03] <sadtaco> That :? is not very .. yeah was ognna say
[20:14:50] <taplar> i'm just showing the logic.  any static values can obviously be made dynamic
[20:16:03] <sadtaco> Eh that only allows going through two. Should be it: https://jsfiddle.net/vkgjso2e/3/
[20:16:35] <taplar> huh?
[20:17:10] <sadtaco> What if you also want to change 6s to 9s? And not just flip back and forth between 2?
[20:17:35] <taplar> then you make that a method and you call it with whatever from and to you wish to swap
[20:17:42] <sadtaco> Oh, shit that doens't work.
[20:22:50] <verax5> robertmax@ thanks man
[20:23:23] <sadtaco> https://jsfiddle.net/vkgjso2e/10/ that works. I must have had a typo somewhere or something
[20:27:41] <taplar> one direction change https://jsfiddle.net/vkgjso2e/11/
[20:27:50] <verax5> yo talplar
[20:27:52] <verax5> long tim no see
[20:27:54] <verax5> wassup

[21:45:55] <aro> has anyone had any luck getting html5 uploads to fall back to work in ie9?
[23:21:20] <gry> hi all. so I have a string and i parseHTML it, but then i am stuck with understanding how to select elements from it. testcase: https://jsfiddle.net/b6gq405c/6/ kindly please assist. thank you in advance :-)
[23:46:44] <aro> when running a plugin in noconflict mode - i get this message: "Object doesn't support property or method '....'"
[23:54:38] <systemfault> Could be a shit plugin assuming a global $
[23:55:58] <aro> hmm
[23:56:07] <aro> how do i fix that?
[23:57:10] <aro> and how do i know if that is the case?
[23:58:09] <gry> $('#iliketrains',parsedHtml) seems to fix it :)
