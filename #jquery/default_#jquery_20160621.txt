[00:29:39] <Vladimirski> is there a function which adds a attributes to to a tag element?
[00:30:14] <Vladimirski> I have created a tag with var a = document.createElement("a"); and I want to use this variable and add a class to it?
[00:30:16] <Vladimirski> is that possible?
[00:30:36] <Vladimirski> I need inly to add a specific class to this specific variable
[00:31:47] <Vladimirski> Any ideas?
[00:33:42] <molavy> hi
[00:33:52] <molavy> i have problem on paste in textarea by users
[00:35:38] <molavy> they paste into textarea from microsoft word or endnote, seems there is lots of hidden data that cause table size increase on database
[03:25:02] <_Justice_> I have this fiddle, https://jsfiddle.net/vwwgxcy6/1/ but for some reason it wont transition color on the div, any ideas why?
[03:25:50] <Justice> I even found that jquery docs use same code and it works. https://jqueryui.com/animate/
[03:28:13] <Cork> Justice: you need jquery ui
[03:28:15] <Cork> not just jquery
[03:29:33] <Cork> Justice: https://jsfiddle.net/vwwgxcy6/2/
[03:29:51] <Cork> Justice: that said, why not just use css3 transition?
[03:32:23] <Cork> Justice: https://jsfiddle.net/vwwgxcy6/3/
[03:32:48] <Cork> Justice: if you want to control it from js, just use a class instead of :hover
[03:34:25] <Justice> Cork: thanks but by being thick dindt you use jquery not jqueryui in your examples there?
[03:34:33] <Justice> didn't*
[03:34:42] <Cork> Justice: check the external resource to the left
[03:35:01] <Cork> Justice: jquery ui extends jquery animate
[03:35:05] <Justice> oh
[03:35:16] <Cork> anyway i strongly recommend the second solution
[03:35:22] <Cork> it gives much smoother animations
[03:35:39] <Cork> only downside is it requires ie10+
[03:35:51] <Cork> (you can detect support and fallback to .animate if you like though)
[03:37:45] <Justice> Cork: sweet thanks =)
[03:38:36] <Cork> Justice: basically avoid js animations if possible (height is one of the exceptions)
[03:39:06] <Justice> why?
[03:39:17] <Justice> (by that i mean why height)
[03:39:22] <Cork> ah
[03:39:30] <Cork> it is a little bit more specific then that
[03:39:40] <Cork> you can't animate height/width: auto
[03:39:49] <Cork> (with css)
[03:40:05] <Cork> you have to either give then a static size or you can't animate them
[03:40:17] <Cork> so that is the one situation where js animation is still needed
[03:45:12] <Justice> Cork: ah yeah, js also does not get it by auto something i experianced few days ago. just give static or calculate with js the expected height.
[03:45:36] <Cork> Justice: uh, js should be able to handle auto just fine
[03:46:01] <Cork> it just asks the browser for the computed height
[03:46:06] <Cork> and go from there
[03:46:30] <Justice> hm tried animate height auto and '' just defaulted back to previous style that i set.
[03:46:53] <Cork> ya, '' means that
[03:49:57] <Justice> but auto didnt work too.
[03:54:19] <Cork> ah, they've removed that code apparently
[03:55:22] <Cork> Justice: https://jsfiddle.net/4rna23o4/
[03:55:55] <Cork> Justice: slideDown does this by default though
[03:57:25] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/4rna23o4/1/
[04:03:20] <Justice> thanks again =)
[04:16:38] <CaptainMoronic> Hello folks. I'm experiencing a gmaps issue. http://gustav.be/rembrandt/contact/ Google map is loading everything but tiles aren't showing.
[05:34:55] <Guest75077> Hi guys, someone can help me about a basic jquery question
[05:36:31] <RenokK> Guest75077: Just ask and wait for someone to answer.
[05:36:51] <Guest75077> I load an ajax from multi selection, $("#x1, #x2, #x3).load("www", {var: $(this).attr("data-sort")})
[05:37:14] <Guest75077> data-sort is on the balise x1 x2 x3, but I cannot use $(this) without to be in a function
[05:37:41] <Guest75077> so my question is how to recover here my data-sort value with my multi selector
[05:37:48] <Guest75077> Thanks a lot in advance !
[05:38:42] <RenokK> $.load( url [, data ] [, complete ] ) | complete => Type: Function( String responseText, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR )
[05:39:23] <Guest75077> but I want to push the post var before the complete status
[05:39:41] <Cork> Guest75077: use $.ajax/post/get and use $().html() on the answer
[05:39:58] <Cork> Guest75077: .load is just a helper to do those two commands for you
[05:41:02] <Guest75077> <div id="x1" data-sort="value"></div>
[05:41:25] <Guest75077> How to set the data-sort value on the POST var of the load() with a multi selection
[05:41:33] <Cork> so you could do something like $('#x1, #x2, #x3').each(function(i, elm) { $.ajax(url, { data: { sort: $(elm).data('sort') }).done(function(data) { $(elm).html(data); }) });
[05:41:54] <Cork> you can't use .load
[05:41:59] <Cork> load only does get to start with
[05:42:10] <Cork> and it doesn't provide a way to do separate calls for each element
[05:42:23] <Cork> .load is a simplified helper for simpler get calls
[05:42:29] <Cork> use ajax if you need more complex calls
[05:42:41] <Guest75077> SO I can't use load() with a multiple selector ?
[05:43:11] <Cork> i've already answered that... twice...
[05:43:53] <Guest75077> Have take a look on your code, I understand now ;) Thanks you mate
[05:49:05] <andywww> I may not have my terminology right here, bear with me but.. if i call the .html() function on a jquery element, is there any way i can pass it a function and insiude that function, access attributes of the elements i’ve called it on? Eg: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ab48c2e893478e8e4f0a73274ff09680
[05:53:35] <Cork> andywww: so you want to modify child elements or replace the content of the element?
[05:53:48] <andywww> replace the content of the element
[05:53:57] <andywww> with the value of a data element on it
[05:54:30] <Cork> $('.odometer').html($('.odometer .child').data('votes')) then
[05:55:15] <andywww> yep, didn’t know if i could return it in a function rather than referencing the dom twice but yeah, that will be fine, thanks
[05:56:10] <Cork> andywww: .html takes a function, but it gives you the html of the old element, not dom elements
[05:56:23] <Cork> so for what you want to do it is more efficient to just select twice
[05:56:39] <andywww> cool
[05:56:41] <Cork> ah, wait
[05:56:47] <Cork> this is set inside the function
[05:56:50] <andywww> there are multiple .odometers though
[05:57:10] <Cork> $('.odometer').html(function() { return $(this).find('.child').data('votes'); }); is an option
[05:57:43] <Cork> (never needed to do this my self so... :D)
[05:57:46] <andywww> $(this) references the window object though
[05:57:51] <Cork> andywww: api.jquery.com documents all this
[05:57:54] <andywww> but yeah
[05:57:55] <Cork> andywww: no
[05:58:12] <Cork> $(this) refers to the element html refers to
[05:58:13] <andywww> well, yeah
[05:58:18] <andywww> no
[05:58:22] <Cork> "Within the function, this refers to the current element in the set." <--
[05:58:32] <Cork> according to the docs
[05:58:42] <Cork> andywww: .html($(this)) won't work though
[05:58:46] <Cork> and i suspect that is what you did
[06:00:33] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3f84a70b45a6084bfde6659c24227414
[06:00:39] <andywww> this logs out the window object
[06:00:50] <Cork> andywww: https://jsfiddle.net/axbmq64f/
[06:00:56] <Cork> works just fine
[06:01:17] <Cork> andywww: $('') is NOT the same thing as $(this).find('')
[06:01:38] <Cork> $('') is the same thing as $(document).find('')
[06:02:43] <andywww> can that fiddle be adopted to work with the class and the data attribute being on the same element?
[06:02:57] <andywww> or do i need to create a new span inside?
[06:02:58] <Cork> andywww: just update it to do what you want and click update
[06:03:34] <Cork> note that the html section should not contain things outside the <body> tag
[06:05:02] <andywww> its 80% there
[06:05:08] <andywww> i just need to not replace the span
[06:05:16] <andywww> or not have the span in there in the first place
[06:05:38] <Cork> then it sounds like you want to modify the content of a child not replace the contnet
[06:05:44] <Cork> *content
[06:06:16] <andywww> i don’t know the difference
[06:06:34] <Cork> i suspect what you want is something like <div><button>vote</button><span class="count">2</span></div>
[06:07:18] <Cork> and $('.obometer button').each(function() { $(this).siblings('.count').html($(this).data('votes')); });
[06:07:22] <Cork> or something like that
[06:07:40] <Cork> (i'm just guessing wildly as you haven't shared anything about what you're trying to do)
[06:07:45] <andywww> <h3 data-votes="832" class="odometer">0</h3>
[06:07:53] <andywww> i want to replace 0 with 832
[06:08:30] <Cork> $('h3.obometer').each(function() { $(this).html($(this).data('votes')); });
[06:09:37] <andywww> there we go
[06:09:38] <andywww> thank you
[06:28:17] <baako> using javascript or jquery how do i get the content in this meta tag
[06:28:17] <baako> <meta content="faf54e8074888e3546be1f2381fc15f76fdbf7914dc79d48f39c43da94074f58" name="csrf-token">
[06:28:45] <baako> oh wait i know how
[06:30:23] <Cork> baako: $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content')
[06:30:28] <codecutter> the value is set to null before it gets the listener. I'm trying to clear the input field immediately after the trigger: $(document).trigger('data', { value: $form } ); $('textArea').val('');
[06:30:33] <baako> var token = $("meta[name=csrf-token]"); console.log(token.attr("content"));
[06:30:36] <codecutter> to the*
[06:30:45] <baako> Cork, less code thanks
[06:30:59] <Cork> baako: always quote values
[06:31:33] <baako> Cork, how come
[06:32:32] <Cork> baako: if the value contains ] or [ things becomes annoying if you don't
[06:32:46] <Cork> baako: so it is just good practice to always do
[06:32:53] <Cork> to avoid that heap of problems
[06:33:00] <baako> alright thanks
[06:33:28] <Cork> (opps space is another problematic value)
[06:36:14] <Solarlux> Hello how javascript library can do server side functions ?
[06:36:20] <Solarlux> Like jquery?
[06:36:28] <Solarlux> If javascript is client-side
[06:36:28] <Solarlux> ?
[06:36:38] <codecutter> Let me put it another way. This variable holds a reference to the actual form node, which contains only one input field. How do I find this method using children/find? (I suppose I can clear the input that way) var $form = $(data.value);
[06:39:24] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[06:44:11] <AdamPDotty> .live
[06:44:37] <codecutter> was that for me?
[06:44:51] <AdamPDotty> ah I do not know the bot commands
[06:45:12] <AdamPDotty> a live example might help to understand your problem
[06:45:49] <codecutter> the value is set to null before it gets the listener. I'm trying to clear the input field immediately after the trigger: $(document).trigger('data', { value: $form } ); $('textArea').val('');
[06:46:56] <AdamPDotty> maybe whoever handles the triggered event should reset the textarea
[06:48:22] <codecutter> problem is the trigger function is listening on multiple forms.
[06:48:45] <codecutter> it can either form a, b or c
[06:48:52] <joaocastanho> I have a <a class="confirm"></a> link inside table and I want to put an event there
[06:48:57] <Chipzz> hi, I'm having a problem with the jquery filter function; with latest firefox (47), this code (http://pastebin.com/ETSBwcmT) works as intended; but with firefox 40 and 37 it doesn't: in FF47, _ is the index and tr is the object; in FF40 _ is empty, tr is the index and the object doesn't get passed
[06:49:21] <Chipzz> is there sth I'm doing wrong or is this a bug in jquery?
[06:49:51] <Chipzz> looks like a bug in jquery and broken compatibility IMO?
[06:51:06] <joaocastanho> solved
[06:57:14] <Chipzz> anyone seeing buggy behaviour with the jquery filter function?
[06:58:09] <shoky> Chipzz: sounds very weird.. but in any case not technically a bug in jquery as it doesn't support those versions i believe
[06:58:31] <AdamPDotty> codecutter: the handler could evaluate a data-attribute to see whether he should empty it
[06:58:36] <shoky> your last line is weird too.. logging a return statement
[06:58:41] <AdamPDotty> like data-empty="true"
[06:58:58] <AdamPDotty> data-after="empty"
[06:59:04] <Chipzz> shoky: actually it isn't; lacking ';', ok, but that is not the problem
[06:59:15] <Chipzz> shoky: it fails just as badly without the console.debug
[06:59:31] <shoky> Chipzz: ya, didn't think that's the problem
[06:59:48] <Chipzz> shoky: probably a c/p error
[07:00:14] <Chipzz> shoky: so what versions *are* supported then?
[07:01:05] <shoky> current and current-1,  so 47 and 46 i suppose
[07:01:30] <Chipzz> uhm whut?
[07:01:36] <Chipzz> that's not a lot...
[07:01:58] <shoky> covers most people ;)
[07:02:43] <AdamPDotty> hmm, covers me
[07:03:07] <shoky> but i doubt you've run into a jquery bug anyway.. c/p = chair/person..?
[07:03:09] <Chipzz> shoky: uhm, not even by a remotely long shot?
[07:03:09] <neredsenvy> I have an input field where I want to allow only integers and ":" how would I do this with jquery
[07:03:18] <Chipzz> shoky: do you know what LTS means?
[07:03:33] <shoky> sorta
[07:04:22] <AdamPDotty> neredsenvy: More than one way. You could check the input after change and reject it, if invalid.
[07:04:23] <Chipzz> was at a friends place last night, he had ubuntu LTS
[07:04:28] <Chipzz> Firefox *37*
[07:04:35] <shoky> so?
[07:04:42] <Chipzz> and you're claiming that 46-47 is enough? lol :)
[07:04:56] <shoky> all i said is most, dude :)
[07:05:13] <Chipzz> I would argue that you're making up numbers :)
[07:05:43] <shoky> ok ;p
[07:06:29] <Chipzz> no offense meant, but you're probably living in a world where when a user sees the "UPGRADE FIREFOX NOAW!" dialog he immediately does so
[07:06:42] <Chipzz> corporate environments are one big exception to that, for starters
[07:07:20] <Chipzz> s/he/she/, before I get into a SJW fight :P
[07:08:33] <Chipzz> I just checked...
[07:08:57] <Chipzz> firefox 46 was released 2016-04-26
[07:09:15] <Chipzz> so are you really saying that jquery does not support anything older than 2 months?
[07:09:19] <Chipzz> much wows!
[07:09:21] <shoky> this is like the last thing i feel like discussing, no offense meant :)
[07:09:39] <shoky> all i said is "most" and "i suppose"
[07:10:10] <Chipzz> I thought jquery was supposed to provide an abstraction on top of browsers, limiting yourself to one year is... I dunnow?
[07:10:27] <Chipzz> trying to come up with a polite word
[07:10:36] <shoky> it's probably not rigid, and more like ~45-47, which accordign to my quick search indeed covers most
[07:10:39] <shoky> as does 46-47
[07:11:38] <Chipzz> your quick search sounds very very broken
[07:12:30] <Chipzz> but I'll see if I can reproduce in a more recent version of FF
[07:12:37] <shoky> it's quick, as i admitted
[07:12:49] <Chipzz> more like insanity
[07:13:39] <Chipzz> especially for web based projects where very often you simply can *NOT* tell your users to upgrade
[07:14:03] <Chipzz> because your users aren't under your direct control
[07:14:13] <shoky> i saw 59.03% usage for ff 46
[07:15:49] <Cork> Chipzz: also make a working example of the problem in a jsfiddle so ppl can look at what is going on
[07:16:14] <Cork> haven't seen any problems with filter in any browser at all (and i test chrome and firefox daily)
[07:29:00] <neredsenvy> AdamPDotty: Is it possible to prevent it from being added to value instead of first adding it and than replacing it
[07:29:33] <neredsenvy> AdamPDotty: https://dpaste.de/47Ow This is how I have it right now
[07:29:37] <neredsenvy> sort of works
[07:30:28] <Cork> neredsenvy: no that is the way you need to do it, though you prob want to store the cursor position so you don't move it to the end all the time
[07:31:01] <Cork> (this.value = this.value will move the cursor to the end of the text)
[07:32:57] <neredsenvy> Problem is if user types a character say a
[07:33:05] <neredsenvy> it appears in input but another press removes it
[07:33:12] <neredsenvy> I dont want it to show up
[07:33:19] <Cork> neredsenvy: use the input event instead of keypress
[07:33:31] <Cork> keypress is a none standard deprecated event
[07:33:46] <Cork> .on('input', function(event) {})
[07:33:51] <Chipzz> FF44 is buggy, FF46 works... trying FF45 atm
[07:34:09] <Cork> Chipzz: provide an example we can test
[07:34:19] <Cork> cause again, i haven't seen any problems what so ever with filter
[07:34:24] <Cork> and i've used jquery for a long time
[07:34:42] <Cork> so i doubt quite a lot that the problem is from outside your code
[07:34:44] <Chipzz> Cork: yeah gonna work on that... FF45 seems to work too... but gonna work out which FF versions work on my end or not first
[07:35:15] <Cork> Chipzz: or provide the code so we can look so the problem isn't coming from there instead
[07:36:25] <Chipzz> ok so FF44 is buggy, 45 and above work. now let me work out a self-contained example
[07:36:55] <Chipzz> Cork: if you want to see the entire code, I can, but that function is part of a 150line function, so you probably want sth more self-contained ;P
[07:37:10] <Cork> Chipzz: i don't want to see the inter code
[07:37:18] <Cork> but a reduced test case
[07:37:27] <neredsenvy> Is there a way to prevent input if value of current input is already .length == 5
[07:37:34] <Chipzz> that's what I was saying with "self-contained"
[07:41:07] <Cork> neredsenvy: if(this.value.length > 5) { this.value = this.value.match('.{0,5}')[0]; }
[07:41:12] <Cork> is one option
[07:43:06] <Cork> neredsenvy: there are newer solutions on can use based on keydown and event.key, but it doesn't work in webkit (works in blink though)
[07:43:13] <Cork> on==one
[07:43:21] <neredsenvy> ty
[07:44:15] <|RicharD|> hi guys
[07:44:50] <|RicharD|> there is a way for get/catch all email address in a html page ? the problem is that I want only know "where" they are and then
[07:45:07] <|RicharD|> I want use things like .append()
[07:45:11] <Cork> no, there isn't
[07:45:15] <|RicharD|> So I can't use a clean regexp
[07:45:21] <Cork> you have to parse the html by regex
[07:45:26] <Cork> the dom can't help you
[07:45:37] <|RicharD|> ok but with regex
[07:45:42] <Cork> unless you want to find linked email addresses only
[07:45:55] <|RicharD|> I only get the email addresses
[07:45:57] <Cork> then you can do $('a[href^="mailto:"]')
[07:45:59] <|RicharD|> I don't get the "position"
[07:46:08] <|RicharD|> yes I know this :( but I need all email addreses
[07:46:10] <|RicharD|> ... :(
[07:46:23] <Cork> the reason you can't get the position is cause text isn't an element
[07:46:28] <Cork> so it doesn't have a position
[07:47:10] <|RicharD|> Ok maybe I could do a simple hack...with a regexp I set a <a> tag to all emails without it
[07:47:16] <|RicharD|> and I add a special class
[07:47:48] <|RicharD|> and then I can append elements, and then I can remove the <a> tag
[07:47:49] <|RicharD|> :)
[07:48:03] <Cork> O_o'
[07:48:10] <Cork> what on earth are you trying to do?
[07:48:19] <|RicharD|> I need to append a icon
[07:48:26] <Cork> (and that that is even an option is scary...)
[07:48:37] <|RicharD|> next to the email addresses
[07:48:38] <Cork> you can't append an icon to test...
[07:48:43] <|RicharD|> I know but
[07:48:45] <Cork> you can inject
[07:48:46] <|RicharD|> listen here
[07:48:55] <Cork> append means you have an element...
[07:49:06] <|RicharD|> with a regexp , I can "catch" all the emails
[07:49:18] <|RicharD|> without a <a> tag like parent
[07:49:20] <Cork> you can catch all common patterns, catching all is hard
[07:49:33] <|RicharD|> (so the format is SPACE+EMAIL+SPACE)
[07:50:00] <|RicharD|> I replace this with <a class="custom-a-ref">EMAIL</a>
[07:50:10] <Cork> its the EMAIL part that is the hard one ;)
[07:50:17] <|RicharD|> so now I've all email addresses in a html element
[07:50:19] <|RicharD|> I know :(
[07:50:50] <Cork> i would recommend doing this server side before as you generate or store the content instead
[07:50:54] <|RicharD|> btw then I can do $('custom-a-ref').append()
[07:51:02] <|RicharD|> I cannot do this server side because it's a chrome extension
[07:51:10] <Cork> cause serializing the entire page and then parsing it back again is VERY expensive
[07:51:24] <Cork> and have a high chance of breaking things
[07:51:42] <Cork> as all the original dom elements will be replaced so all old event handlers will be lost
[07:52:54] <|RicharD|> fuck this is true
[07:53:07] <Cork> doing what you want to do is possible
[07:53:27] <Cork> but you have to drop below elements and work with a dom walker and the node tree
[07:53:32] <Cork> and from there check text nodes
[07:53:46] <Cork> and it... is an interesting work...
[07:54:46] <|RicharD|> out of my league
[07:54:50] <|RicharD|> :)
[07:54:52] <|RicharD|> fuck
[07:55:44] <Cork> this is what you need https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createTreeWalker
[07:56:22] <|RicharD|> stupid question
[07:56:32] <|RicharD|> and If I parse the page
[07:56:36] <|RicharD|> (word by word)
[07:56:48] <|RicharD|> and every word I check if it match with a email pattern
[08:30:33] <neo123> trying to find the value of the data attribute which belongs to one of the chidldren. console.log($(e.target).find('[data-msg-id]').val());
[08:31:08] <Cork> neo123: you need .attr('data-msg-id')
[08:31:15] <Cork> .val() looks for value attributes
[08:31:24] <Cork> (well value properties but anyway)
[08:32:25] <neo123> you mean like this? console.log($(e.target).attr('[data-msg-id]').val());
[08:32:32] <Cork> no
[08:32:43] <neo123> you mean like this? console.log($(e.target).attr('[data-msg-id]')); *
[08:32:44] <Cork> .find('[data-msg-id]') finds the element with that attribute
[08:32:51] <neo123> ah!
[08:32:59] <neo123> and the value?
[08:33:06] <Cork> .attr('data-msg-id')
[08:33:26] <Cork> you can only access attributes from the element they are on
[08:33:34] <Cork> you can't find an attribute individually
[08:33:40] <neo123> i need to find the element first , rigth?
[08:33:46] <Cork> right
[08:33:49] <neo123> e.target is the parent
[08:34:33] <neo123> so the actual element with that attribute is a child of that $(e.target)
[08:35:02] <neo123> therefore i need a that find function
[08:35:08] <Blinky_> Hi all, I am having an issue with the event reference not being found when using firefox, on chrome this works fine, any ideas where I place the event? - http://pastie.org/10885159
[08:35:32] <neo123> unless i missed something...
[08:36:07] <Cork> Blinky_: event isn't a global variable in standards
[08:36:19] <Cork> Blinky_: ie and webkit has one though
[08:36:40] <Cork> Blinky_: so forward the event object from the event handler and it should work
[08:36:46] <baako> hi guys ajaxSend method that call on everu ajax call or do you have to request for it to be call e.g. http://kopy.io/iZ0kG if i call the GetTransaction or refundPayment will the ajaxSend fire too?
[08:37:49] <Cork> baako: ajaxSend is an old compatibility method
[08:38:01] <Cork> it is an event the $.ajax fires when it is about to make an ajax call
[08:38:09] <Cork> so yes it will fire without you doing anything
[08:38:24] <baako> Cork, whats the new method then
[08:38:33] <baako> because i want to set an http header before i make a call
[08:38:47] <baako> before the call is made so i can then get in server site
[08:38:50] <Cork> baako: i didn't mean it is deprecated
[08:38:56] <Cork> just that it is an event so no method
[08:39:02] <Cork> .on('ajaxSend'
[08:39:14] <Cork> ^ that is what .ajaxSend does internally
[08:44:43] <neo123> Found element now I need the value.  console.log($(e.target).find('[data-post-id]'))
[08:45:09] <Cork> neo123: read through the answers, i've already told you what you need to know
[08:45:13] <neredsenvy> Why does substring not work if my input has value like 14:959 that's my value and I do this.value =  this.value.substring(0, 5) and nothing happens
[08:45:37] <neredsenvy> nevermind
[08:46:18] <Blinky_> Cork: sorry but I am still at a loss, I am on the mozilla reference pages now but it is not making much sense to me, could you explain a little more please?
[08:46:33] <neo123> undefined: console.log($(e.target).find('[data-msg-id]').attr('data-msg-id'));
[08:46:49] <Cork> Blinky_: you haven't shared enough info to tell you
[08:47:04] <Cork> Blinky_: make a jsfiddle.net with the element the event comes from, the code you execute
[08:47:12] <Cork> and i can show you how to fix it
[08:47:38] <Cork> neo123: that is highly unlikely
[08:47:56] <Cork> unless the value of data-msg-id has been removed
[08:48:43] <neo123> do i need the brackets inside .attr string?
[08:48:48] <Cork> no
[08:48:53] <neo123> hmm
[08:48:59] <neo123> let me try again
[08:49:43] <jose3_> any of yall ever use this before http://formvalidation.io/ ?
[08:50:01] <Blinky_> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/s7am53me/1/ I do not know how to setup an ajax request using fiddle but this is what I have running at the moment.
[08:50:05] <Cork> neo123: https://jsfiddle.net/j3wt2q53/
[08:50:27] <Cork> Blinky_: ah... don't use event attributes
[08:50:34] <Cork> they are horrible for a LONG list of reasons
[08:50:54] <Blinky_> Cork: ok so how do I stop the hyperlink from reloading the page?
[08:51:10] <Cork> Blinky_: firstly don't abuse links for none links
[08:51:19] <Cork> use a <button>, you can style it to your liking
[08:51:27] <Cork> links should always be working links
[08:51:35] <Blinky_> ok
[08:52:26] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/s7am53me/2/
[08:52:39] <Cork> also you can't call event.preventDefault() from inside the success callback
[08:52:45] <Cork> it will be WAY WAY to late
[08:52:52] <Cork> and the event will already have been processed
[08:53:24] <Blinky_> Cork: the button worked a treat, just need to style it to look like text and its a winner, thanks a lot for all the information
[08:53:42] <Cork> Blinky_: a side note, use <button type="button">
[08:54:06] <Cork> else you might inadvertently trigger submits in a form (as type="submit" is the default action for buttons)
[08:56:04] <Blinky_> ah, would not have thought of that :)
[09:11:34] <neo123> Trying to add an attr to the element with a value: console.log(this.$node.find('.message-id').attr('value').val('100'));
[09:16:30] <Cork> neo123: you really need to read through learn.jquery.com
[09:16:42] <neo123> i got it :)
[09:30:46] <geri> hi, how can i declare 2 jquery dialogs but only open 1 at a time? dialog-message2 is visible in the background... http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/8040/
[09:31:29] <geri> do a $("dialog-message2").hide(); ?
[09:35:17] <Cork> geri: you can disable the auto open in the options
[09:36:05] <geri> autoOpen: false, ?
[09:36:13] <Cork> yes
[09:38:24] <geri> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/8041/
[09:38:38] <geri> the other dialog is still visible in the background...can you see?
[09:38:43] <geri> i really need to hide it...
[09:41:19] <Cork> geri: http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/8043/
[09:41:25] <Cork> you mised to include jquery-ui
[09:42:28] <geri> Cork: i missed the js lib?
[09:42:33] <Cork> ya
[09:43:10] <Cork> corrected autoOpen http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/8044/
[09:44:20] <geri> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/db5SX/8046/
[09:44:30] <geri> Cork: i see that both are open...
[09:44:38] <geri> i only want to open 1 at a time
[09:44:51] <Cork> check 8044
[09:45:37] <geri> ok
[09:49:43] <geri> Cork: does it also work with jquery ui min?
[09:50:14] <Cork> geri: min is just the normal lib ran through a minifier
[09:50:23] <Cork> it just compresses the code into an unreadable mess
[09:50:39] <geri> i see
[09:51:44] <geri> what happens if i declare a div but dont use it for the dialog?
[09:51:49] <geri> is it visible by default?
[09:52:13] <Cork> that has nothing to do with the js
[09:52:21] <Cork> it depends on what the elements style are
[09:52:38] <geri> on the css?
[09:54:09] <Cork> geri: the simplest solution is to put the dialog content in a <script type="text/template">
[09:54:18] <geri> ok
[09:54:31] <Cork> and do $($.trim($('#script-id').html())).dialog()
[09:54:32] <geri> or a <script type="template" id="score-template"> ?
[09:54:52] <Cork> then it won't be visible until you want it
[09:55:00] <Cork> (as it won't be in the dom at all)
[10:27:25] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/DMU37FZz/
[10:34:21] <jose3_> got it
[10:35:01] <Cork> jose3_: if you had a question, you forgot to ask it
[10:39:47] <AwkwardCough> the question was inside the pastebin
[10:47:06] <geri> Cork: thanks!
[10:47:36] <Yepp> how do I access variable or pass a variable to another .on()? http://www.hastebin.com/senubuyelo.coffee
[10:48:01] <Cork> Yepp: you would have to wrap it in a scope and share a variable between them
[10:48:17] <Cork> or attach the value on the $(this).data() if it is on the same element
[10:49:12] <Yepp> $(this).data() is dynamic
[10:49:30] <Cork> ya, that is why i said "if it is on the same element"
[10:49:49] <Yepp> just saying :D :v
[10:53:49] <Yepp> Cork, I guess I'll just move the .on inside the first .on cause the second won't be visible anyway without opening the modal first. Thanks
[10:54:08] <Cork> Yepp: nesting events is normally a bad idea
[10:54:14] <Yepp> whoops
[10:54:17] <Cork> just wrapp it in (function() {})();
[10:54:28] <Cork> and define a var sharedVariableName = something;
[10:54:30] <Yepp> oh, ok.
[10:54:31] <Yepp> yea
[10:55:00] <Yepp> I thought of that first actually, but thought of just moving it there cause a bit lazy but it's fine... i'll just do that
[10:55:05] <Cork> Yepp: though note you will have data stored cross event targets, so it might overwrite each other in ways you didn't think of
[10:55:32] <Cork> (and is why i recommended .data())
[11:01:30] <Yepp> Cork, I just made an anonymous function as a wrapper and it's fine now :)
[11:09:08] <cmrabet> Hi all
[11:10:55] <cmrabet> I'm working on a web application that have several js scripts that I load at the end of the body tag. All these scripts use some variables that I set in a main.js file that I load before the rest. This script is at the same time pulling these values from the server with a $.get function. The problem I have is that the $.get is asynchronous, and the rest of the files load before the data is returned from the server causing errors. How can
[11:10:56] <cmrabet> I delay everyhting else until the $.get in the main.js file is over?
[11:13:18] <Yepp> 2nd function's argument does not update, but the 1st does. http://www.hastebin.com/vexoqepeki.coffee
[11:14:40] <yottabyte> hi, can I do something like $.post(url, {a: some, b: thing}).done(function(responseObject1, responseObject2) { //use a & b here});? pass arguments to .post?
[11:14:50] <Gnjurac> hi i have an ifreme i would like to load only on button click can that be done?
[11:15:04] <yottabyte> well I want to pass data, too
[11:15:40] <Yepp> Gnjurac, use .on() or click() then load it from there
[11:17:10] <cmrabet_> I'm working on a web application that have several js scripts that I load at the end of the body tag. All these scripts use some variables that I set in a main.js file that I load before the rest. This script is at the same time pulling these values from the server with a $.get function. The problem I have is that the $.get is asynchronous, and the rest of the files load before the data is returned from the server causing errors. How can
[11:17:10] <cmrabet_>  I delay everyhting else until the $.get in the main.js file is over?
[11:18:50] <yottabyte> cmrabet_: you can use the promise returned by $.get and then use .done() https://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[11:19:15] <yottabyte> so var a = $.get(...);, a.done(function(response) { // do stuff });
[11:19:18] <cmrabet_> yottabyte: thanks, but how is that preventing the other scripts from loading?
[11:19:22] <yottabyte> if I understood your problem correctly.
[11:20:09] <cmrabet_> yottabyte: I have several <script..>..</script> tags at the bottom of the <body> tag
[11:20:30] <cmrabet_> yottabyte: all of them make use of an object defined in another <script> that is loaded before all of them
[11:20:45] <cmrabet_> yottabyte: this script does a $.get call
[11:20:52] * Yepp knocks
[11:21:10] <cmrabet_> yottabyte: I've noticed that all the other scripts finish before the first one comes back from the $.get call
[11:21:44] <cmrabet_> yottabyte: so they complain, because the object is not ready when they load
[11:24:37] <Gnjurac> Yepp:  sorry waz afk am doing some unexpected stuff , but ty will try it later
[11:29:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaah much better.
[11:39:02] <robertmaxrees> http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/146199451740/not-standard-usage-of-standard-library hahahaha
[11:42:03] <arc_> oh hi robertmaxrees
[11:42:17] <arc_> been on vacation or something?
[11:42:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:42:43] <arc_> cool
[11:42:50] <robertmaxrees> 2 weeks in europe.
[11:43:02] <arc_> nice
[11:43:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  glad to be back though.
[11:43:23] <arc_> yeah it's hard to live without #jquery
[11:43:30] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[11:43:39] <sillyslux> robertmaxrees, welcome back :)
[11:44:09] <arc_> i was gonna link this to you when it went up http://xkcd.com/1691/
[11:44:13] <arc_> bet you enjoyed that one
[11:44:20] <sillyslux> ehm... i live in europe, so it's more like welcome away?
[11:46:12] <robertmaxrees> hah sillyslux++
[11:46:40] <robertmaxrees> arc_ that's... awesome.
[11:46:41] <jose3_> I want to build a simply application with a single page/view. The application is a form that gets submitted to a crm database, shows some text to a call-center rep, and allows the rep to get a table of data. Would a  framework be overkill or should I just code it out by hand?
[11:47:16] <robertmaxrees> jose3_ one page?  is it a simple page? probably no need for a framework.
[11:48:47] <jose3_> uhm i think its simple. it will make a few api calls and retrieve some data from a json file
[11:48:57] <jose3_> so just code it by hand then?
[11:49:50] <robertmaxrees> though future needs might dictate things differently, should be fine to do it all by hand.
[11:50:04] <jose3_> okay thanks for the input
[12:14:43] <yottabyte>  hi, can I do something like $.post(url, dataToSend, {a: some, b: thing}).done(function(responseObject1, responseObject2) { //use a & b here});? pass arguments to .post?
[12:16:40] <robertmaxrees> you could declare the object ahead of time and then access it from there if it's in the same scope.
[12:19:12] <yottabyte> robertmaxrees: so the function() in .done will have access to variables in the same scope?
[12:19:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.  just like any other function.
[12:39:02] <blakespot> So I have script tags in my footer and this function sitting in them
[12:39:19] <blakespot> jQuery(".toggleclick").click(function () { alert('!!'); });
[12:39:37] <blakespot> when I click the anchor with class="toggleclick", the alert does not fire
[12:39:51] <robertmaxrees> do you dynamically add that element?
[12:40:00] <blakespot> Do I need to be inside of $(document).ready.... ?
[12:40:01] <robertmaxrees> also: try preventing default in there, too.
[12:40:20] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: to me? no I do not add it dymancailly
[12:40:27] <blakespot> dynamically
[12:40:32] <robertmaxrees> and your code is after the element in the document
[12:40:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:40:42] <blakespot> yes in footer where anchor is higher up
[12:40:52] <robertmaxrees> try preventing default.
[12:41:07] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: can you extrapolate on that?
[12:41:27] <robertmaxrees> function(e) {e.preventDefault(); console.log('!!');};
[12:42:39] <blakespot> Including that function before my script -- I have done so
[12:42:42] <blakespot> No change
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[12:52:10] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/Ln9y4xq2/
[13:07:46] <yottabyte> so it seems I can't do $.post(...).done(...).fail(...).then(...) if the post goes into the fail. I want the then to always happen (regardless of success or fail). Should I just change it to always?
[13:08:37] <robertmaxrees> .then() takes two arguments./
[13:08:58] <robertmaxrees> .then(done, fail);
[13:09:17] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.always/
[13:12:28] <relipse> hi, i'm trying owl carousel on this page 3 times, https://www.handofhelp.com/resources/ but only the first one shows up correctly, they all jam together
[13:16:09] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're not properly clearing floats somewhere.
[13:19:49] <relipse> robertmaxrees thats what I thought but then i added clear: both everywhere and it still didn't work
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> adding clear: both; randomly to things doesn't necessarily fix things lol
[13:38:08] <yottabyte> my serverside will return a jsonerror message if the request fails with a meaningful error in a json response, if there a way to get that with the jquery .fail? the fail handler arguments just seem to have a generic error message, and the one returned from the server just lost
[13:39:27] <robertmaxrees> tthe first arg passed to the rejected promise callbacks in the jqXHR object, which has a responseText property.
[13:39:32] <robertmaxrees> that should be what you want.
[13:40:01] <robertmaxrees> .then(null, function(jqXHR) { console.log(jqXHR.responseText) });
[13:40:35] <yottabyte> so I can't use .post and chain the .done and .fail?
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:40:46] <robertmaxrees> didn't say anything about htat.
[13:40:48] <robertmaxrees> *that
[13:41:03] <robertmaxrees> you could just as easily use .fail() there instead, but you should probably look at using .then() most of the time.
[13:41:06] <yottabyte> well I said "if there a way to get that with the jquery .fail?"
[13:41:24] <robertmaxrees> .fail() is a shortcut to the second callback in .then()
[13:42:33] <robertmaxrees> generally you want to use .then(), especially if you're already using both .done() and .fail().  but ether way, you could pass that function to .fail() and get what you're looking for.
[13:43:33] <yottabyte> so the responseText is not the json my server is returning. it's the generic <h1>HTTP Status 500 - </h1><div class=\"line\"></div><p><b>type</b> Status report</p><p><b>message</b> <u></u></p><p><b>description</b> <u>The server encountered an internal error that prevented it from fulfilling this request.
[13:43:48] <robertmaxrees> that's what your server is returning then.
[13:47:01] <yottabyte> it's basically just a json object trying to be returned, it seems like jquery doesn't like that and doesn't accept it, and just puts the HTTP Status 500
[13:47:10] <yottabyte> since I guess it is kind of insecure
[13:47:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:47:14] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't do that at all.
[13:47:24] <robertmaxrees> your server is returning a 500 and returning that generic error message.
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> so you need to fix the way your server is doing error handling.
[13:47:44] <yottabyte> well this was a yui2 ajax call before this, and the failure callback had the jsonmessage object
[13:47:52] <yottabyte> I just rewrote it using jquery
[13:47:59] <robertmaxrees> then you're doing something differently.
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> that probably means the request isn't what it was before.
[13:49:37] <yottabyte> I have a breakpoint in my server code, and it's returning the exception in the same format and in the same way
[13:49:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't change the http response code.
[13:49:54] <robertmaxrees> it can't.
[13:50:03] <yottabyte> I even did fail(function(messages, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) to see what all of the objects were
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> so something tells me you're handing the server a different request.
[13:50:09] <yottabyte> yeah, I'm not claiming it does
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> "it seems like jquery
[13:50:27] <robertmaxrees> doesn't like that and doesn't accept it, and just puts the HTTP Status 500
[13:50:31] <yottabyte> I'm saying it see ths 500 response, and it doesn't try to accept any objects
[13:50:40] <yottabyte> being passed back
[13:50:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:50:45] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change that.
[13:51:03] <robertmaxrees> the responseText property is whatever it got from the server.,
[13:59:29] <z1haze_work> any thoughts on how this is done? http://www.dior.com/beauty/en_us/th/dior_makeup_how_to.html#expand/summer-look-2016-milky-dots-by-hanneli
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> how what is done?
[14:02:52] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work ^
[14:06:39] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: I get nothing in the console when I recreate your console code in my click function...
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> blakespot then something is misspelled, the code isn't actually included, or you have an error breaking things.
[14:07:03] <blakespot> Seems to not be registering a click when I click
[14:07:19] <robertmaxrees> add a console.log() above the binding to make sure the code is actually firing.
[14:09:16] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: The bootstrap-collapse.js extension which reveals/hides a div based on clicking a div is pointing at the same element that I am trying to attach to.
[14:09:22] <blakespot> Is that the conflict likely?
[14:09:35] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:09:50] <robertmaxrees> 'conflict'? unless they're stopping propagation in their handlers, i have no idea.
[14:10:10] <blakespot> Hmm
[14:10:36] <robertmaxrees> fwiw most bootstrap js plugins emit events you can subscribe to.,
[14:10:38] <blakespot> All Im' trying to do is to change one icon to another to accompany the open or closed state of the hidden div
[14:10:41] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse-events
[14:13:11] <blakespot> Ah yes, thank you
[14:13:25] <blakespot> I am using 2.3.2 bs, but I see the exposed events on this modulke
[14:25:50] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: Thank you
[14:25:55] <blakespot> So that's working
[14:25:58] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:26:22] <blakespot> Now, I have a list of similar divs - all with hidden content divs associated. Here is one line of the scenario:
[14:26:28] <blakespot> jQuery("[id^=collapse]").on("hidden", function () {
[14:26:37] <robertmaxrees> so back way up.
[14:26:41] <blakespot> ids are collapse0, collapse1, collapse2
[14:26:44] <blakespot> ?
[14:26:49] <robertmaxrees> jQuery("[id^=collapse]") - why not use a class?>
[14:27:36] <blakespot> Well, I am clicking one div and I need to reveal another
[14:27:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.  whhy aren't you using a class to select those instead?
[14:28:00] <blakespot> if I use same class name for all, effect would happen to all simultaneously no?
[14:28:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:28:13] <blakespot> i have a class on them, let me switch over
[14:28:23] <robertmaxrees> at least for that binding, use a class.
[14:30:42] <blakespot> Ok that works to detect the click
[14:31:57] <blakespot> but say there are 30 lines like this and each has an icon that I want to toggle out
[14:32:08] <blakespot> I want to toggle only the icon on this line on click
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do it.  all depends on how your markup is done.
[14:32:25] <blakespot> now, the class listed is indeed a parent class to the icon in each
[14:32:27] <robertmaxrees> could use .closest() and .find() to get the particular icon.
[14:32:52] <blakespot> each item of that class has the icon in question as a child, not immediate child
[14:33:12] <robertmaxrees> it's really hard ot help without seeing markupf wiw.
[14:33:15] <blakespot> no no
[14:33:19] <blakespot> i ma wrong it is not a child
[14:33:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, mind sharing your markup?
[14:39:58] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: gladly
[14:40:12] <blakespot> http://pastebin.com/5JhN2dJu
[14:40:42] <blakespot> Line 12 has the class purchase-item-detail-wrap where I am listening for the bootstrap-collapse "shown" or "hidden" event
[14:40:58] <blakespot> And based on that I need to chagne the innerhtml of the span on line 7
[14:41:07] <blakespot> Thank you for the assistancfe
[14:41:13] <robertmaxrees> this isn't complete
[14:41:19] <robertmaxrees> you're missing markup from this.
[14:42:09] <blakespot> This is one of the several "blocks" that are listed down the page.
[14:42:16] <blakespot> I can point you to the page on my Qa
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:42:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole page.
[14:42:27] <robertmaxrees> just a complete markup example.
[14:42:28] <blakespot> What do you mean not complete
[14:42:42] <robertmaxrees> you have a closing </a> tag on line 10 that's never opened.
[14:43:46] <blakespot> You are correct -- I neglected the first line of the block. I've re-pasted the entire block, with the first line. Sorry.
[14:46:16] <z1haze_work> sorry robertmaxrees had a meeting, but http://www.dior.com/beauty/en_us/th/dior_makeup_how_to.html#expand/summer-look-2016-milky-dots-by-hanneli shows them manipulating the dom based on responses from youtube via an iframe video
[14:46:58] <z1haze_work> i figure since CORS you cant listen to any events fired from an iframe, more make any changes to an iframe
[14:52:47] <blakespot> Well this does not work as the action: jQuery(".purchase-item-detail-wrap").closest(".pkg-caret").html("&#x2715");
[15:05:31] <yottabyte> can you add multiple .done to a jqHXR? if so, will they execute in order added?
[15:06:06] <yottabyte> I have a function that preforms a ajax call and returns the jqHXR, and there's already one .done() on it in the function. I want to add another one in another function that calls that function with the ajax call
[15:09:26] <blakespot> Can I get .parents() and then get child such that I get the div I need?
[15:09:51] <blakespot> That is, several layers up there is a common parent between the listening div and the div I must change, but they are siblings of sorts
[15:20:23] <robertparkerx> If content is dynamically truncated with a readmore appending after the truncated text I should be able to append a google ad after the button too right?
[15:21:35] <z1haze_work> can you pass parameters to methods you are calling at setInverval?
[15:25:25] <bango2> i think setInterval requires an anonymous function
[15:25:57] <bango2> but yeah, i dont see why you couldnt enclose a method call in an anonymous func
[15:26:09] <z1haze_work> i have like var currentTime = setInterval(getCurrentTime, 1000); but i need to pass an variabel to that method
[15:26:10] <snover> it does not need to be anonymous.
[15:26:24] <z1haze_work> variable*
[15:26:43] <bango2> setInterval(function() {getCurrentTime(myVar)}) might work
[15:26:45] <snover> 1. don’t use setInterval, use recursive calls to setTimeout instead; 2. use a closure
[15:26:55] <bango2> yeah +1 to timeout
[15:26:58] <z1haze_work> what's the difference?
[15:27:13] <z1haze_work> i hate recursion i dont understand it
[15:27:41] <bango2> have your call to your function, and inside your function, have a setTimeout that calls the function its in
[15:28:07] <bango2> function something() {console.log('hello);setTimeout(something(),30);}
[15:28:33] <bango2> then just call something() and itll take care of calling itself after 40 ms
[15:28:34] <z1haze_work> sorry, what?
[15:28:39] <z1haze_work> oh ok
[15:28:49] <z1haze_work> will it keep repeating?
[15:28:53] <bango2> yes
[15:29:20] <bango2> so you need to add a termination option that will make it stop
[15:29:23] <snover> that code is wrong
[15:30:35] <snover> function loop() { /* do what you want to do */ setTimeout(loop, 20); } loop();
[15:32:29] <bango2> wrong how?
[15:32:39] <bango2> snover
[15:33:55] <snover> well, let’s see. 1. missing closing '; 2. calling `something` immediately and passing its return value to setTimeout instead of passing `something`; 3. the timeout interval you wrote is 30, but then you said it would be called every 40ms. #2 is the big one.
[15:34:57] <z1haze_work> relax man, the 2 is right next to the 3, some people have fat fingers
[15:35:07] <bango2> lol the 40 was a typo. that was very critical of you, but hey I asked for it right
[15:35:07] <z1haze_work> or 3 next to the 4, etc
[15:36:56] <bango2> so yeah, now that I think, setTimeout requires an anonymous function, right? so why would setTimeout(something,... work?
[15:37:10] <robertmaxrees> "requires an anonymous function" wut?
[15:37:29] <bango2> setTimeout(something(),30) wont work, right robertmaxrees?
[15:37:34] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:37:36] <robertmaxrees> no ()
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout(functionName, 30);
[15:38:11] <robertmaxrees> you pass the object.  setTimeout(something(),30) runs the function immediately and uses the return.
[15:38:12] <snover> it has nothing to do with whether the function has a name. in fact, the name is required in order to do recursion.
[15:38:20] <bango2> it needs a setTimeout(function() {/*stuff*/},30)
[15:38:25] <robertmaxrees> bango2 nope.
[15:38:27] <snover> no
[15:38:29] <robertmaxrees> you can use a named function.
[15:38:34] <bango2> oh ok, so the function doesnt have to be anon, just pass it a whole function
[15:38:40] <bango2> instead of a call to a function
[15:38:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:38:43] <robertmaxrees> pass it the name.
[15:38:46] <robertmaxrees> instead of the call.
[15:38:56] <bango2> makes sense, thanks
[15:39:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q4pvunkm/
[15:40:44] <robertmaxrees> pretty much the same anywhere you can pass a callback.
[15:47:04] <moldy> hi
[15:47:23] <moldy> can i set .val() on an element without triggering change events on that element?
[15:50:42] <cangelosx1> how do I properly name input fields in a form submitting multidimensional arrays? For example, I'm trying to pass a parameter called filters which is a multidimensional array like so: filters: {categories: [1,2], types: [4,8]} etc
[15:51:06] <AwkwardCough> moldy: .prop('value', "new Value") should not trigger change
[15:51:22] <cangelosx1> would I do <input name="filters[categories]" or maybe "filters[categories][]"
[15:51:44] <cangelosx1> or maybe even "filters[0][category]"
[15:51:54] <moldy> AwkwardCough: ah, thanks
[15:57:23] <bango2> robertmaxrees back to what we were talking about a bit earlier, if you wanted to pass params to the function being passed to setTimeout, the logical thing would be to wrap the actual function call with params in an anonymous function, right? kinda like what I was talking about?
[15:58:39] <bango2> setTimeout(function() { doStuff(17) }, 30); would there be another way to pass the 17?
[16:02:09] <moldy> hmm. i have a function that changed the value of an <input> element. it seems that this change is triggering a keyup event on that element. is that to be expected?
[16:10:11] <xinming> Just curious, Is it possible to do select   [data-attr1=1] and not [data-attr2] defined?
[16:11:25] <xinming> ignore me.
[16:11:31] <xinming> seems data-attr2!="" worked
[16:15:32] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're not just using classes or filter or ids or something?
[16:21:38] <moldy> so it seems the browser is firing keyup events all over the place even if i don't touch the keyboard? is that normal?
[16:21:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:22:32] <robertmaxrees> and how are you confirming that?
[16:22:43] <moldy> robertmaxrees: alert() in the event handler
[16:22:50] <robertmaxrees> mind showing what code you're using?>
[16:23:20] <moldy> robertmaxrees: it's called 3 times on page load :p must be a silly mistake on my part
[16:23:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you're binding to and i have no idea what else your page has on it ;)
[16:23:44] <robertmaxrees> could be all kinds of things.
[16:24:12] <moldy> robertmaxrees: https://dpaste.de/DePB
[16:24:55] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you mean this particular element seems to be firing keyup events.  using any other plugins or anything?
[16:25:50] <moldy> robertmaxrees: the alert() line gets called 3 times on page load (i have 3 elements that the handler is bound to, incidentally)
[16:25:59] <moldy> robertmaxrees: yeah, there is angularjs and whatnot on the page as well :p
[16:26:13] <robertmaxrees> so then maybe something else is doing something that causes the event to fire.
[16:27:06] <moldy> robertmaxrees: could be. any idea how to debug this, or if there is an alternative that is likely to work?
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> could look at the event object and see if it tells you anything.
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, start excluding code.
[16:33:32] <naximus_> hello
[16:34:06] <moldy> robertmaxrees: ah, got it. my stupidity, of course.
[16:34:12] <robertmaxrees> moldy what was it?
[16:34:41] <moldy> robertmaxrees: too many event handlers triggering other event handlers ;)
[16:34:46] <robertmaxrees> moldy O.o
[16:34:53] <robertmaxrees> you aren't using .trigger() are you?
[16:34:59] <moldy> robertmaxrees: i am
[16:35:05] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[16:35:07] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[16:35:30] <moldy> robertmaxrees: in a success handler for an ajax request ;)
[16:35:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah still not a good idea.
[16:36:18] <naximus_> how to get screen coordinates of the viewport origin? (window.screenY + (window.outerHeight - window.innerHeight))
[16:36:19] <naximus_> window.outerHeight seems to be off by ~9px
[16:36:34] <naximus_> in chome
[16:36:40] <naximus_> *chrome
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> this in a popup?
[16:37:16] <robertmaxrees> naximus_
[16:37:35] <naximus_> no
[16:37:56] <naximus_> its for drag drop
[16:37:58] <robertmaxrees> 'cause iirc there are some bugs with chrome and popup windows and coordinates.
[16:38:29] <naximus_> ff also seems to be off
[16:38:50] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet you have some funky positioning going on somewhere.
[16:39:26] <naximus_> i feel like i am missing something? margin? border? etc
[16:39:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.
[16:40:16] <naximus_> i have spend a couple of hours into it. would very much appreciate any help.
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> i might ask in ##javascript - they might know.
[16:41:55] <naximus_> ok will try that too
[16:50:54] <moldy> robertmaxrees: i'm a backend person forced to do front-end work ;)
[16:51:03] <robertmaxrees> okay ;)
[16:51:15] <robertmaxrees> (not sure why that's relevant but okay)
[16:51:33] <moldy> robertmaxrees: it's just a lame excuse for having no idea about js best practices :p
[16:51:47] <moldy> robertmaxrees: i will see if i can refactor this code to avoid the problem. thanks so far!
[16:52:02] <robertmaxrees> easy change in this case: pull out the handlers into functions and call those functions instead.
[16:53:31] <moldy> robertmaxrees: here is the whole naked truth: https://dpaste.de/WjPP
[16:54:35] <moldy> (line 40 is the one i just found and commented out as a test)
[16:54:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah you're like halfway there.
[16:55:25] <moldy> oh good ;p
[16:56:20] <naximus2> <robertmaxrees> body { margin: 0 }
[16:56:29] <naximus2> thanks for the suggestion!
[16:56:32] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[17:12:00] <tables> how do i switch between divs?
[17:12:02] <tables> is there something online that shows me how?
[17:12:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:12:08] <tables> i just want to switch/toggle between divs when i click links
[17:12:19] <robertmaxrees> click event handler and hide / show
[17:12:51] <tables> i need syntax
[17:12:59] <robertmaxrees> for which part?
[17:13:02] <tables> i just want to click on links and switch a div center area
[17:13:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/
[17:13:09] <tables> maybe the whole thing?
[17:13:10] <tables> lol
[17:13:11] <robertmaxrees> start by adding your markup.
[17:13:15] <tables> i'm new to jquery
[17:13:16] <robertmaxrees> we can help you figure it out from there.
[17:13:23] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a great resource.
[17:21:09] <z1haze_work> I am trying to include premium fonts from myfonts.com and i am getting a bunch of errors in the console saying OTS parsing error: Failed to convert WOFF 2.0 font to SFNT anyone familiar?
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> could be a few different things.
[17:22:00] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/32490822
[17:22:19] <z1haze_work> they provided a js file
[17:22:35] <z1haze_work> it says to host the files on our server, then include the js file and it will do the rest
[17:22:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd reach out to their support then.
[17:22:48] <z1haze_work> im guessing it compares which files exist on our server, then pull the correct ones from their server? i dunno
[17:22:55] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> checking to make sure you're allowed to use 'em.
[17:23:27] <z1haze_work> they sent us this font pack
[17:23:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so i'd reach out to their support.
[17:23:36] <z1haze_work> so we should be authorized
[17:23:41] <robertmaxrees> since you're paying for them and all :)
[17:23:55] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[17:24:01] <robertmaxrees> how'd you upload the files to your server?
[17:24:13] <z1haze_work> im not the client is though, they are super expensive too
[17:24:28] <z1haze_work> anyhow, i just upload them to our server in a custom directory
[17:24:29] <robertmaxrees> same difference.  either way.  how'd the files get uploaded?
[17:24:36] <robertmaxrees> using FTP or...?
[17:24:42] <z1haze_work> yea webdav, same thing
[17:24:54] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> is it? lol
[17:25:03] <robertmaxrees> either way, it might be treating the files as text.
[17:25:07] <z1haze_work> works the say for me :)
[17:25:09] <robertmaxrees> should treat them as binary.
[17:28:20] <z1haze_work> they are being uploaded correctly
[17:28:26] <robertmaxrees> as binary files?
[17:28:30] <robertmaxrees> and not as text?
[17:29:11] <tables> http://paste2.org/HGsdg1H9   <-- why isn't this code switching divs?  it just shows the divs   am i missing a file or something?
[17:29:22] <tables> i'm basically trying to make this work;
[17:29:25] <tables> :
[17:29:28] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/rHKML/
[17:29:33] <robertmaxrees> tables need a document ready.
[17:29:34] <robertmaxrees> bbiab.
[17:29:40] <tables> it should switch the divs
[17:40:11] <robertmaxrees> back.
[17:49:12] <bango2> ive got this function that clears a select box options, and adds another placeholder, disabled option that says please wait... while the ajax runs (after which it will repopulate)
[17:49:12] <bango2> http://pastebin.com/Xd0vzbXH
[17:49:54] <bango2> the problem is, when i repopulate and there are no options repopulated (ajax returned empty json), the please wait wont go away until i click in the select box, at which point it disappears
[17:50:17] <robertmaxrees> fix your ajax call to handle that case.
[17:51:25] <bango2> empty json calls a function which calls the function I linked, with loading = false
[17:51:43] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:51:50] <robertmaxrees> dunno what that changes about my suggestion.
[17:51:51] <bango2> then a console log and nothing else, so all options should be removed but its not removed until i actually click
[17:52:01] <robertmaxrees> then you have bad code somewhere.
[17:52:10] <robertmaxrees> also: .attr() for setting value seems really strange.
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> why not just use .val();
[17:52:30] <bango2> because i orioginally was using a select2 library
[17:52:51] <bango2> idk that doesnt make sense still
[17:52:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:52:57] <bango2> val would work
[17:53:22] <bango2> i had more attr than val at some point maybe and wanted to kill many birds
[17:53:52] <robertmaxrees> you should use .val()
[17:53:58] <bango2> faster?
[17:54:02] <robertmaxrees> smarter.
[17:54:16] <bango2> so no effect on runtime?
[17:54:29] <robertmaxrees> runtime is going to be entirely irrelevant in this case.
[17:54:36] <robertmaxrees> write readable code that is predictable.
[17:54:54] <robertmaxrees> .val() handles a lot of extra work for you under the hood that properly sets the value of inputs.
[17:55:23] <bango2> isnt it just adding html attribute, value="something"?
[17:55:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:55:47] <robertmaxrees> it sets the dom property, not the attribute, and also makes sure some events get fired.
[17:56:01] <robertmaxrees> in cases where you're not setting a value, you want .prop()
[17:56:12] <robertmaxrees> you basically rarely want to use .attr()
[17:56:20] <tables> http://paste2.org/HGsdg1H9   <-- why aren't the divs switching?  it works on jsfiddle
[17:56:31] <robertmaxrees> tables you need a document ready.
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> tables the elements don't exist when your js runs.
[17:57:11] <robertmaxrees> tables or move your JS to just before the closing body tag.
[17:58:16] <tables> what is document ready?
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[17:58:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:58:57] <tables> can you show me syntax
[17:59:02] <tables> or tell me where to put the document ready?
[17:59:18] <robertmaxrees> go to that page and click the link about it.
[17:59:25] <robertmaxrees> it will explain it to you.
[18:00:08] <bango2> ok, so inspecting the element, the DOM is definitely removing all the options.  So the select is still thinking it has something selected.  could it be the case that I need to .prop(selected false) selected options before removing them?
[18:01:16] <tables> robertmaxrees: can you fix my post?
[18:01:24] <tables> $( document ).ready()
[18:01:29] <tables> i put that in front of all the jquery code
[18:01:30] <robertmaxrees> tables read the page.
[18:01:31] <tables> and it doesn't work still
[18:01:33] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:01:37] <robertmaxrees> because that's not how you use it.
[18:01:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to do some readong.

[18:03:10] <tables> thx it works now
[18:03:12] <tables> thx alot
[18:40:14] <PantsOfChocolate> hey jquery peeps random question, https://jsfiddle.net/rL08L2ct/, are the two jquery calls the same? how come when I bind on the document it doesnt work? but when I bind directly to the element it works?
[18:40:46] <robertmaxrees> way different.
[18:40:55] <robertmaxrees> and they both work.
[18:41:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rL08L2ct/1/
[18:41:41] <PantsOfChocolate> see i know that they should work the same
[18:41:42] <PantsOfChocolate> but they done for me
[18:41:57] <robertmaxrees> then something is stopping propagation of that click event.
[18:42:02] <robertmaxrees> but they work in different ways.
[18:42:34] <PantsOfChocolate> new question
[18:43:03] <PantsOfChocolate> so lets say i bind the second way, and prevent event delegation, then the binding on document wouldnt fire correct?
[18:43:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rL08L2ct/3/
[18:43:41] <robertmaxrees> easy to find out.
[18:45:35] <PantsOfChocolate> interesting
[18:45:44] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[18:45:49] <PantsOfChocolate> thanks for the help, still isnt working but gave me some good hints
[18:46:12] <robertmaxrees> fwiw any click listeners on parent elements that stop propagation may also be to blame.
[18:47:10] <PantsOfChocolate> yea its just strange so its all loaded through ajax so its future elements and that i understand
[18:47:21] <PantsOfChocolate> but after the ajax has loaded and the element im trying to bind to is clearly there
[18:47:33] <PantsOfChocolate> when i bind through document it fails, but just doing the other way in my fiddle works fine
[18:48:02] <robertmaxrees> triple-check the selector and don't bind to document if possible.
[18:48:04] <robertmaxrees> bind lower.
[18:48:15] <PantsOfChocolate> like body?
[18:48:22] <PantsOfChocolate> or even lower?
[18:48:26] <robertmaxrees> lower.
[18:48:34] <robertmaxrees> bind to the parent of the thing you're replacing.
[18:48:38] <PantsOfChocolate> the highest level that isnt affected by the ajax?
[18:48:39] <PantsOfChocolate> gotcha
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> or whose contents you're replacing.
[18:48:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah basically.
[18:49:33] <PantsOfChocolate> gotcha, so basically it could be a parent elements prevent event propagation that could cause this?
[18:49:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.

[21:43:57] <FilliasFog> hey guys, my website show me some unsecure content but when i search for that content on the page its not exist
[21:44:11] <FilliasFog> how can i locate the issue?
[22:11:07] <YottaByte> if a function, say function A(), which does $.get().done().fail() and returns the jqXHR, can I call function A in function B and add another .done()? will the .done() execute in the order they were added (is this the right word?)?
[22:49:56] <Trinity> why do I need a plugin in order to do animate({'background':'#ffffff'}) ?
[23:10:31] <systemfault> Trinity: Because jQuery doesn't know how to do color transitions.
[23:10:47] <systemfault> Trinity: Use CSS3 unless you want to support old browsers.
[23:16:56] <Trinity> systemfault, what would be the technical reason for why jQuery doesn't know how to do color transitions?
[23:17:10] <systemfault> There's no technical reason, it's just not there.
[23:17:28] <Trinity> systemfault, is there any reason why it was decided it shouldn't be included into the jQuery core package?
[23:17:37] <systemfault> Gotta ask the devs.
[23:57:42] <muley> my guess is to save space and keep the library from being too bloated. it's a perfect fit for a plugin really
[23:58:33] <muley> *was... pre-CSS3 days =]
