[12:46:26] <momomo> no lectures please .. why if you eval("var a = 1; ")  ... the variable is declared in the scope ... but when you eval("function a(){}")  it does not become accessible after the eval? am i missing something?
[12:47:37] <Woet> momomo: why are you using eval?
[12:52:54] <momomo> Woet: experimenting ... i am extracting code to become reusable and can normally pass a function where there are differences, however, when you do you loose access to the surrounding scope ... I can pass the variables to the functin, but then also a second function also passed but called lower down  than the first relies on stuff that the first uses ... I could generate all of the javascript and pass those two different code pieces as
[12:52:54] <momomo> strings and add them in the correct place .. but I kind of dislike that
[12:54:08] <momomo> i know there are other ways around this, but the basic idea i am trying to solve is to be able to extract any code without having to completely rework it ... just remove the piece and call the extract method with those two/three differing code pieces/functions
[12:55:03] <momomo> Woet: made any sense?
[12:55:12] <momomo> did you at least understand my point?
[12:56:56] <momomo> Woet: everything kind of works using eval .. only i notices that declarations of function fnName() {} is not found lower donw .. i need to do var fnName = function() {} i think .. so a little rework
[14:27:50] <segurb> how can I take data attributes values of selected elements and concatinate them into array, or json that values easly?
[14:46:42] <momomo> segurb: Array.prototype.slice.call($(element).get(0).attributes)
[19:34:22] <vixivtech> I have an ajax success callback where I want to iterate through every element, so I have: $('*').each(function() {/*Logic*/}); My question is how would I detect different tags like <script>, <meta>
[19:35:33] <vixivtech> I can do similar for finding certain id's
[19:35:36] <vixivtech> if(this.id != user_id){
[19:35:55] <vixivtech> but not sure for tags
[19:36:39] <vixivtech> this.is("script")
[19:36:40] <vixivtech> ?
[22:37:36] <Devastator> can I ask questions about Ajax here?
[22:40:46] <vixivtech> not many here
[23:42:15] <vixivtech> anyone?
