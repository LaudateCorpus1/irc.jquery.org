[05:45:41] <hollusion> hello
[05:45:56] <hollusion> i need help finding out how to set default settings for this plugin
[05:45:57] <hollusion> https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jQuery-QueryBuilder@2.5.2/dist/js/query-builder.js
[05:46:14] <hollusion> any idea how to do that? couldnt find anything about it in the docs
[05:46:33] <preference> you mean how to change the default settings?
[05:48:06] <hollusion> oh i think i found it
[05:48:21] <hollusion> $.fn.queryBuilder.defaults(options);
[05:48:33] <hollusion> seems to do the job. thank you for responding
[05:58:59] <Guest34657> Wha'ts wonrg ? https://jsfiddle.net/7xxb2osj/          ReferenceError: t is not defined   same for id. the code is located in footer.php and footer.php included in categories.php
[05:59:14] <Guest34657> ajax call with jquery
[06:00:12] <Guest34657> categories.php?t=Partitions
[06:14:02] <Cork> Guest34657: where are the values suppose to come from?
[06:14:04] <Cork> static?
[06:14:27] <Guest34657> Cork categories.php?t=Partitions
[06:14:35] <Cork> no, that is the result
[06:14:39] <Cork> not where it comes from
[06:15:05] <Cork> actually the url differs so... what are you trying to do actually?
[06:16:14] <Guest34657> Cork sending get parameter to dataSelect
[06:16:23] <Cork> parameters from where
[06:16:39] <Cork> currently your looking for a variable that doesn't exist
[06:17:03] <Guest34657> Cork wait
[06:23:31] <Guest34657> Cork When I click on link Furnitures it redirecte me to categories.php?t=Furnitures
[06:25:00] <Cork> and the ajax call runs on that page?
[06:25:25] <Guest34657> Cork on footer.php included in categories.php
[06:25:41] <Cork> Guest34657: what php does doesn't matter
[06:25:51] <Cork> javascript has no access to server info
[06:26:17] <Cork> only to what the server scripts write to the response
[06:32:41] <Guest34657> Cork what should i do
[06:34:41] <Guest34657> to send type and id
[09:04:06] <lemontree> how can I access $(this) inside an object's parameter function? https://pastebin.com/rm7MccrV
[09:04:41] <Cork> you mean from outside line 1?
[09:05:30] <lemontree> yes, inside the elementParse parameter
[09:05:39] <lemontree> line 5
[09:06:02] <Cork> ya, i get where you want it, but from where does the value come?
[09:06:18] <lemontree> which value
[09:07:18] <Cork> $(this)
[09:07:36] <Cork> "this" is contextual so it isn't a normal variable name
[09:08:29] <lemontree> but $(this).find('img') returns undefined
[09:08:48] <Cork> yes, but again that is where you want access to something
[09:08:52] <Cork> not where it comes from
[09:08:59] <Cork> you need to show the context of this code
[09:09:38] <lemontree> the html? <div class="wrapper"> ... <img /> </div>
[09:09:57] <Cork> so you expect this to be the wrapper?
[09:10:03] <lemontree> yes!
[09:10:14] <Cork> ok, then you have to look into the plugin
[09:10:17] <lemontree> line 6
[09:10:32] <Cork> it is up to it to give you that reference
[09:11:13] <lemontree> can't i just bind "this"? i struggle to do that
[09:11:24] <Cork> no you can't
[09:11:58] <Cork> this is a special variable in javascript it is for "the object this function is called on
[09:12:22] <Cork> but it is also set through an .call() or .apply() action in the function
[09:12:32] <Cork> and that is what the plugin has to do
[09:14:21] <lemontree> I want to achieve the same as with something like: $('.element').on('click', function() { $(this) ... });
[09:14:27] <lemontree> ok, I see
[09:15:19] <Cork> that is achived by $.fn.on = function(event, callback) { callback.call(currentElement, event); };
[09:15:26] <Cork> (psudo code)
[09:15:40] <Cork> so unless the library does the same you can't do it
[09:16:34] <Cork> lemontree: and https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup/blob/master/src/js/core.js#L69
[09:16:36] <lemontree> ok, I thought something like $('.wrapper').magnificPopup({ ... }).bind(this) would work
[09:16:52] <Cork> no
[09:17:01] <Cork> that isn't even what you want
[09:17:42] <Cork> you bind a specific value to a function with .bind()
[09:18:10] <Cork> something like a = function() { console.log(this) }.bind(1); a.call(2)  will log 1
[09:18:24] <Cork> so it isn't at all what you want here
[09:19:24] <lemontree> so if I want to look for any img-elements inside $('.wrapper') I have to change it in the plugin?
[09:19:26] <Cork> lemontree: but have a look at arguments
[09:19:33] <Cork> it might be another argument to the function
[09:19:46] <Cork> no
[09:19:54] <Cork> but you have to see how it passes the current element
[09:25:04] <lemontree> ok, thanks
[11:09:08] <goodafternoon> why I have Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource with $.get('https://mydomain/api.php') ? Who blocks the resource ? My browser or my remote website ?
[11:09:13] <goodafternoon> I'm confused
[11:13:32] <ryan_ford> the host server has to allow it via a response header i believe
[11:13:48] <shoky> goodafternoon: it's the browser doing the blocking, because it's a cross-origin request, and the server is not responding with cors headers
[11:15:47] <ryan_ford> https://enable-cors.org/
[11:17:30] <goodafternoon> I see, but I don't understand the point. Coz I can just ask the same resource with a default POST request and it gonna work
[11:17:54] <goodafternoon> why this layer of complexity ?
[11:19:28] <ozette> is anyone able to explain to me why the end result of e.total changes in this code https://paste.debian.net/hidden/f1fdad66/
[11:20:13] <ozette> during the upload, my application shows for example "5 KB / 20 MB" as an indication of the progress
[11:20:37] <ozette> and when it's done it suddenly says " 10.65 KB / 10.65 KB"
[11:21:53] <goodafternoon> well, I just said bulshits, there is just something I don't understand. I can go on https://mydomain and my browser has no problem with it. But requesting it with javascript need the server to explicitly say "all right, it's ok to take my resource guys B) ". Why ?
[11:24:21] <ryan_ford> some people don't want their apis open to the public i guess
[11:24:38] <Uhkis> it's your browser saying "i dont trust this place"
[11:26:56] <ryan_ford> https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/
[11:27:05] <ryan_ford> this is an alternative
[11:34:32] <goodafternoon> Uhkis but the trust comes only from the fact that CORS is not enabled by default on an apache server, it looks strange
[11:35:27] <goodafternoon> ryan_ford the thing is, it's a php file, runned on an apache server, it's designed by default to be public
[11:36:36] <goodafternoon> I try to understand the philosophic principle behind this
[11:37:45] <ryan_ford> sorry about that, I think I was incorrect in that statement, Uhkis is correct
[11:39:13] <goodafternoon> I'd like to allow crossed origin on my server but now I'm afraid of a security hole lol
[11:39:15] <ryan_ford> give this a read if you're interested in the hows and whys https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[11:46:10] <goodafternoon> thanks ryan_ford
[11:48:10] <jak2000> hii all

[11:50:27] <jak2000> yes i have
[11:50:49] <goodafternoon> did you add #  ?

[11:50:58] <jak2000> yes
[11:51:02] <jak2000> only here not :)
[11:51:11] <goodafternoon> lol ok
[11:51:31] <goodafternoon> maybe .append() ?
[11:51:36] <jak2000> try
[11:53:10] <goodafternoon> $("#selectid").append("<option value='1'>1</option>");      $("#selectid").append("<option value='2'>2</option>");
[11:53:17] <goodafternoon> try like this
[11:53:41] <jak2000> not work :(
[11:53:55] <goodafternoon> give the whole code x)
[11:53:55] <jak2000> not know if is a select option Bootstrap problem
[11:55:25] <AdamPDotty> $('#selectid')append('<option value="1">').append('<option value="1">'); should work
[11:58:32] <jak2000> creating fiddle
[13:16:38] <jak2000> goodafternoon: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/kjb1rgdt/
[13:16:42] <jak2000> can try help me? please
[13:17:27] <taplar> use append
[13:17:33] <taplar> html() replaces the contents entirely
[13:18:16] <jak2000> yes i want replace entirely
[13:18:19] <jak2000> but not do the job :(
[13:18:49] <jak2000> when user click on button clear and add i want se 2 options.. only
[13:19:07] <taplar> you should take a look at the api for the bootstrap component you are using
[13:19:15] <taplar> it should have a method for changing the selection options
[13:20:11] <jak2000> ok
[13:21:06] <jak2000> reading: https://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/methods/
[13:23:56] <taplar> "To programmatically update a select with JavaScript, first manipulate the select, then use the refresh method to update the UI to match the new state. This is necessary when removing or adding options, or when disabling/enabling a select via JavaScript."
[13:24:59] <jak2000> yes i have this:
[13:25:00] <jak2000> $('#idTipoProd').html(json.xHtmlTipoProductos);
[13:25:00] <jak2000>             $('.selectpicker').selectpicker('refresh');
[13:25:46] <taplar> why are you targeting something different than the selectpicker?
[13:26:24] <jak2000> i have 6 select/options same class different id
[13:30:45] <taplar> k, well i changed the event to 'show.bs.select' since the user would not be clicking directly on the select, but for some reason the event is still not firing so i'm missing something still
[13:34:16] <jak2000> ok...
[13:34:22] <jak2000> robertmaxrees hi friend!!!
[13:37:39] <shoky> jak2000: if you want it to be triggered by button click, then set the click handler on the button, not the select..
[13:38:20] <shoky> works fine  https://jsfiddle.net/kjb1rgdt/1/
[13:41:22] <taplar> i'm confused why the show.bs.select or shown.bs.select are not firing
[13:57:17] <shoky> taplar: old bootstrap-select version in that fiddle
[13:57:49] <taplar> oh
[15:32:12] <Jagst3r15> can someone take a look at lines 22 through 27 here? https://pastebin.com/ussR6JyT
[15:32:32] <Jagst3r15> in safari you cannot post via ajax with empty file inputs so i am trying to remove them before submission
[15:32:38] <Jagst3r15> but it is not working - not sure what is wrong
[15:35:59] <Jagst3r15> anyone have any idea?
[15:44:58] <shoky> Jagst3r15: "not working" is not helpful
[15:48:48] <Jagst3r15> shoky I changed line 24 to if ( files.length == 0 ) {
[15:49:14] <Jagst3r15> when i run lines 22 through 27 in the console it returns only the empty file inputs
[15:49:36] <Jagst3r15> but for some reason the ajax request is working, but it does not submit any files :(
[15:50:15] <shoky> donno what you mean by " run lines 22 through 27 in the console"
[15:56:22] <lkjd> Someoe can execute this code and tell me what he got plz with GET also, I want to know if I have a problem with my server : https://jsfiddle.net/vpygqv9h/
[15:57:29] <taplar> that ajax request isn't going to work.  the url is a relative one
[15:59:35] <taplar> also is that ajax request making a request to the page it originates from?
[16:02:34] <lkjd> taplar Ive changed , to request to the page
[16:03:05] <lkjd> I got Alfred within popup window with all code and alfred displayed
[16:04:07] <lkjd> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/vpygqv9h/1/
[16:04:57] <taplar> ok?  so what's the question?
[16:07:42] <lkjd> taplar In the popup window I got Alfred for echo $nick;    but on the page I got Hi Notice: Undefined index: name in cart.php on line 29
[16:07:57] <taplar> sure
[16:08:55] <lkjd> taplar  why ??
[16:09:10] <taplar> you didn't provide the name when you originally loaded the page
[16:09:31] <taplar> if you put ?name=Alfred in the url of your page, you should see it show up
[16:11:34] <lkjd> taplar ok it's working
[16:12:07] <lkjd> and without providing in the url by get request with ajax I got a popup Hi ALfred
[16:12:17] <taplar> sure
[16:12:41] <taplar> you are providing it to the url as part of your ajax request
[16:13:17] <lkjd> taplar yes
[16:13:38] <lkjd> taplar now back to my code and trying to understand why it doesn't work
[16:13:50] <taplar> it is working.  that's why i'm asking what the question is
[16:14:40] <lkjd> taplar  yeah this code works but mine with other files doesn't work now I'm sure it's my first code that doesnt works
[16:30:17] <robertmaxrees> so is the issue that your server is throwing an error?
[16:36:15] <lkjd> robertmaxrees no
[16:36:42] <robertmaxrees> 'cause that's what that error message looks like (shrug)
[16:38:03] <lkjd> robertmaxrees Yes why When I'm trying to do this
[16:38:19] <robertmaxrees> aye, because your server is throwing an error :)
[16:39:49] <lkjd> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/uqbgts84/
[16:39:52] <sam-lap> hi guys, i've this piece of code (php + js) https://ghostbin.com/paste/s4cre can some one help me out or point me to the right direction to download the excel file  ? thanks
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> lkjd right, and what was the error?
[16:40:25] <lkjd> robertmaxrees I'm getting on test1 Hi Notice: Undefined index: name in order.php on line 4
[16:40:36] <robertmaxrees> lkjd yeah, that's your PHP file erroring.
[16:40:50] <lkjd> robertmaxrees so wha'ts wrong the code or my config ?
[16:41:00] <lkjd> it works fine with just alert()
[16:41:10] <lkjd> alert(data)
[16:41:20] <robertmaxrees> lkjd I'd check the network request and make sure you're sending the data to the server correctly.
[16:41:35] <robertmaxrees> and then I'd look on the PHP side to make sure the GET params match what you're expecting.
[16:41:38] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap https://stackoverflow.com/a/48437227/923919
[16:42:19] <lkjd> robertmaxrees how to do it really
[16:42:27] <robertmaxrees> lkjd i know know php.
[16:42:30] <robertmaxrees> *don't know
[16:42:35] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to ask in #php
[16:45:47] <taplar> i feel like he's misunderstanding ajax requests
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:47:01] <taplar> lkjd: you've stated it doesn't show up on the page load, but does show up on the alert.  you haven't stated what about that you consider an error
[16:53:11] <lkjd> taplar I wanted to do load(data)  not load(order.php)
[16:53:32] <robertmaxrees> lkjd you're doing an ajax request to the php file.
[16:53:35] <spaces> I'm back!
[16:53:37] <robertmaxrees> the php file is throwing an error.
[16:53:37] <spaces> and in bed
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> lkjd so that'
[16:53:56] <robertmaxrees> *that's why it's showing you that.
[16:54:39] <lkjd> robertmaxrees I got no more error now
[16:54:44] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[16:54:57] <lkjd> but my div isn't filled with paramter value
[16:55:07] <lkjd> blank page
[16:55:10] <robertmaxrees> becuase your php isn't returning the data you think it is.
[16:56:49] <lkjd> robertmaxrees ok
[16:58:56] <morenoh149> can jquery help here? https://gist.github.com/morenoh149/39205cf5c44434daad5b14c84363fb78
[16:59:25] <robertmaxrees> morenoh149 "help" how?
[16:59:27] <morenoh149> var form = new FormData($('#login-form')) doesn't work
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> because FormData needs a DOM node
[16:59:52] <robertmaxrees> $() gives you a jquery object.
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> you can get DOM nodes out of jquery objects, though your gist doesn't need to do that.

[19:59:02] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[19:59:08] <robertmaxrees> what's the question?
[19:59:21] <Ninjacoder_> the loop doesnt work
[19:59:46] <Ninjacoder_> i need to show (output some lines from data.items.leght) like the author , published and photo
[19:59:52] <robertmaxrees> because you're doing document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
[19:59:55] <robertmaxrees> you want to append.
[20:00:18] <Ninjacoder_> hmm..
[20:00:56] <Ninjacoder_> how exactly ?
[20:01:26] <robertmaxrees> also your js is invalid.
[20:01:57] <Ninjacoder_> yep
[20:01:57] <robertmaxrees> you can use http://api.jquery.com/append/ to append
[20:02:19] <robertmaxrees> or you could use the native .map() over that array and pump out the markup you want.
[20:02:21] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways.
[20:02:53] <Ninjacoder_> mmm dont uderstant
[20:02:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:03:17] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = data.items[x].author is doing?
[20:04:00] <Ninjacoder_> yes
[20:04:08] <robertmaxrees> so instead of doing that
[20:04:11] <robertmaxrees> append things
[20:04:38] <robertmaxrees> instead of replacing the contents.
[20:05:08] <Ninjacoder_> i dont need the loop with the append ?
[20:05:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:05:30] <robertmaxrees> you can use .map() instead if you don't want the loop.
[20:05:35] <robertmaxrees> but i'd start by fixing what you've got here.
[20:05:40] <robertmaxrees> since the map is a little more complex.
[20:06:05] <jolvera> ninja need more training in jQuery-jitsu
[20:06:06] <jolvera> j/k
[20:06:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:06:21] <Ninjacoder_> yep
[20:06:30] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder_ so where are you lost?
[20:06:42] <Ninjacoder_> still in then append.
[20:06:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:07:05] <robertmaxrees> so try using jquery to append that stuff instead.
[20:07:53] <Ninjacoder_> i could use getjson(data); ?
[20:07:56] <robertmaxrees> ....
[20:08:00] <robertmaxrees> you already have the data.
[20:08:03] <Ninjacoder_> that change all
[20:08:19] <robertmaxrees> literally you need to swap out document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = data.items[x].author
[20:08:22] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[20:08:26] <robertmaxrees> and fix the errors.
[20:08:52] * Ninjacoder_ fixxing

[20:14:50] <lolii> $("#test1").load("order.php?" + $.param({name: $(".test2").val(), id: 2}));  how to pass  test2 link value to name ?
[20:15:19] <robertmaxrees> lolii "link value"?
[20:15:26] <robertmaxrees> lolii you mean the href or the text or...?
[20:15:38] <lolii> <a href="#" class=".test2">text</a>   her text
[20:15:50] <robertmaxrees> lolii you want .text()
[20:15:55] <robertmaxrees> not .val() - that's for inputs.
[20:16:01] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder_ why do you have another for loop??
[20:16:32] <Ninjacoder_> the loop is to show the 20 outputs in the data
[20:16:50] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:16:56] <robertmaxrees> you nested a second for loop in the first one.
[20:17:25] <robertmaxrees> also: you can't repeat the same var x in the same function.
[20:17:30] <Ninjacoder_> oh sorry bad paste
[20:17:48] <robertmaxrees> also: the thing you want to append is data.items[x].author, right?
[20:18:38] <lolii> robertmaxrees thanks
[20:19:15] <Ninjacoder_> robertmaxrees yes and other lines
[20:19:26] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder_ start with the one for now.
[20:19:34] <robertmaxrees> so how would you append that line to that element?
[20:19:40] <Ninjacoder_> i need data.items[x].published , data.items[x].media
[20:19:54] <Ninjacoder_> yep.
[20:19:59] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder_ start with one thing at a time and get the basics down :)_
[20:20:06] <Ninjacoder_> the loop i think is correct
[20:20:29] <robertmaxrees> it's one way to do it.
[20:21:12] <Ninjacoder_>  data.items[0].title; with this doesnt work
[20:21:23] <robertmaxrees> shoow me.
[20:21:37] <Ninjacoder_> https://jsfiddle.net/_ninjacoder_/bk8957ka/7/
[20:21:48] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:21:53] <robertmaxrees> where in there are you appending that data?
[20:22:20] <Ninjacoder_> oh. one sec go to check
[20:22:22] <robertmaxrees> and why did you take the interator number out of data.items[0].title; ???
[20:24:00] <pavonia> I'd add an extra loop, just to be sure
[20:24:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:24:10] <robertmaxrees> not helping
[20:25:12] <robertmaxrees> Ninjacoder_ i gotta leave in the next like 5 mins sooo
[20:25:39] <Ninjacoder_> robertmaxrees
[20:25:42] <Ninjacoder_> $('body').append ?
[20:25:45] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:26:01] <Ninjacoder_> never used append before
[20:26:02] <robertmaxrees> your original example was target #demo >.>
[20:26:09] <robertmaxrees> why do you keep changing the element around?
[20:27:07] <Ninjacoder_> because i take an example from inet
[20:27:12] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[20:27:18] <robertmaxrees> let's step through this.
[20:27:22] <robertmaxrees> originally you had document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = data.items[x].author;
[20:27:24] <robertmaxrees> right?
[20:27:28] <Ninjacoder_> yep
[20:27:30] <Ninjacoder_> yet
[20:27:49] <robertmaxrees> so the first part is that you need to select that demo element via jquery
[20:27:52] <robertmaxrees> so how do you do that?
[20:28:08] <Ninjacoder_> ok
[20:28:09] <robertmaxrees> protip: same way you would via css.
[20:28:23] <Ninjacoder_> $('demo').append
[20:28:30] <robertmaxrees> $('#demo')
[20:28:40] <robertmaxrees> need the # in there to tell it that it's an ID
[20:28:46] <robertmaxrees> just like with css
[20:28:51] <Ninjacoder_> ok ok
[20:28:53] <robertmaxrees> the .append is almost right.
[20:28:57] <robertmaxrees> so how do you use that?
[20:29:24] <Ninjacoder_> dontknow
[20:29:42] <robertmaxrees> it's a method - you "pass" data.items[x].author as an argument.
[20:30:21] <robertmaxrees> so how would you do that??
[20:30:29] <Ninjacoder_> document.getelemntByid?
[20:30:32] <robertmaxrees> ...
[20:30:33] <robertmaxrees> no
[20:30:41] <Ninjacoder_> $('#demo').append(data.items[0].title;); ?
[20:30:42] <robertmaxrees> you already have the element with $('#demo')
[20:30:50] <robertmaxrees> kill the semicolon on title
[20:30:58] <robertmaxrees> so it's just $("#demo").append(data.items[x].title);
[20:31:02] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[20:31:14] <robertmaxrees> (with the x, since you want that index)
[20:31:48] <Ninjacoder_> oh.
[20:31:58] <robertmaxrees> anyway, long story short, you can build up html as strings and then use that .append() to add it to whatever.
[20:32:01] <robertmaxrees> i gotta go.
[20:32:02] <robertmaxrees> bye
[20:32:15] <Ninjacoder_> yes thx
[20:32:21] <Ninjacoder_> he left-.-
[20:32:40] <Ninjacoder_> gg.
[22:22:55] <Jay12345> click http://www.devblx.com/app/t/ the scrolling up and down doesn't work right what so ever, yet when you do "inspect element" it works just fine or if the browser is resized works just fine. boggled.
