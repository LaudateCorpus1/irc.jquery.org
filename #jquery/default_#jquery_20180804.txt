[05:22:09] <solsTiCe> hi. using jquery.flot and the jquery.flot.canvas plugin, I am trying to save an image of the chart using right-click save as image. I only got an empty image. Is this expected to work with the canvas plugin ? or Do i need to do it programmatically with something like getCanvas().toDataURL() stuff ?

[07:06:43] <how2hack> hi, is there any way to unset a variable where i store the scrollTop() of an element?
[07:07:22] <how2hack> so that the next time i do .scrollTop(bar) it doesn't do anything?
[07:10:02] <how2hack> delete doesn't work, maybe it's because i create the variable with var (although i don't set it to anything in that moment), but i'm also trying setting the variable to null, undefined and to a string ('abc') but it is still setting the element's scroll after that
[07:12:21] <how2hack> because, unless i'm mistaken (i could be) variables should point to the current value in memory right? so if I change the value before calling .scrollTop(bar), it shouldn't do anything right?

[19:43:37] <RandomSerb> I use an selector, $('foobar').change(function(){}) ; said selector gets mulitple objects. How can I know which object exactly was changed?
[19:46:21] <pavonia> You use $(this) in the event handler

[20:09:14] <shoky> fine, +r it is
[20:25:01] <RandomSerb> yes, that helped. Now, how can I remove an item from selection, not from dom
[20:25:57] <sian> does jquery override css properties?
[20:26:45] <RandomSerb> sian: you can use attr, which you can use to add/change style of an tag
[20:26:50] <sian> I had put hover css selector in css file on 'a' elements.
[20:27:07] <sian> but it doesn't work if I had manipulated it in my jss
[20:27:19] <RandomSerb> how did you manipulate it?
[20:28:31] <sian> http://jsfiddle.net/ytzp82qk/1/
[20:28:43] <sian> it was sibling to a class
[20:29:08] <sian> hovering over 'a' elements no longer causes it to change color
[20:38:05] <pavonia> RandomSerb: $matches.not(elem) should work
[20:38:27] <RandomSerb> pavonia: yeah, found it, not(":last") in my case
