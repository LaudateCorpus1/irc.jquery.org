[08:26:53] <sine0> hello fello code nerds
[08:27:59] <sine0> I am trying to make the button unclickable after it has been clicked, its not working and this is my attempt: https://bpaste.net/show/IFXOM
[08:32:45] <sine0> im thinking the bind click is not honoring the disabled
[08:34:43] <Cork> sine0: you don't access dom properties on jquery objects
[08:35:08] <Cork> qither use this.disabled = true/false or $().prop('disabled', true/false);
[08:35:29] <Cork> but there is little point searching for it again when "this" is the element you want
[08:36:11] <Cork> also don't use eval in setTimeout use setTimeout(function() { contact.ContactFormSubmit(); }, 2000)
[08:46:19] <sine0> ok so I have made the changes
[08:46:36] <sine0> it seems that the disabling of the button is not re enabled though
[08:47:07] <sine0> setTimeout(function () { this.disabled = false; }, 3000);
[08:47:11] <Cork> ya, this changes inside functions
[08:47:27] <Cork> so you need to store this in a different variable outside setTimeout and use that variable inside it
[08:47:40] <sine0> ahh ok
[08:48:02] <Cork> ex. var self = this; setTimeout(function() { self.disabled = false; })
[08:48:39] <sine0> roger that
[09:05:27] <sine0> thanks cork. sorted, you helped alot.
[09:05:35] <Cork> np
[09:06:37] <sine0> I built a quote for a year ago for someone and there always duplicate submissions because they kept clicking over and over...
[10:31:53] <Wilfredor> if if i have $element1 selector, how I could select the div with "element2", ? <div><div id="element1" /><div id="element2" /></div>
[10:32:01] <Wilfredor> of cours without using the element id
[10:32:53] <Wilfredor> $element1.closet("div") ?. Btw, I could add a class to my other div
[10:33:41] <Wilfredor> or $element1.parent.find(".myclass").first() ??
[10:34:01] <Wilfredor> thanks in advance
[11:11:08] <shoky> Wilfredor: if they have IDs you can just use the ID.. $('#element2')    otherwise, usually best to do  .closest('.parentClass').find('.childClass')
[11:11:10] <pavonia> Wilfredor: $element1.next("div")
[11:12:07] <Wilfredor> but If I want use the class?
[11:12:21] <Wilfredor> ok
[11:30:59] <Wilfredor> how I could listen DOMSubtreeModified after everything is charged ?
[12:18:07] <grid-> hey
[12:18:09] <grid-> i'm looking for a mulitpage like this https://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/pages-multi-page/index.html it has been made in jquery mobile but it's made in 2014 and i wanna have something more up to date that can do the same, does anyone know where to look?
[12:18:42] <grid-> jquery mobile didn't have updates the last years either
[14:01:09] <Wilfredor> on observe function I could send a type element filter, for example only inputs elements?
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:01:39] <Wilfredor> MutationObserver
[14:01:55] <robertmaxrees> could you try rephrasing the question and maybe show us some relevant code?
[14:02:54] <Wilfredor> its a generic question to ask how set a mutations filter before call a new MutationObserver
[14:03:27] <robertmaxrees> so not a jquery question :) i'd head back over to ##javascript and see what they end up tellin' ya :)
[14:03:50] <Wilfredor> :D  sorry
[14:07:14] <robertmaxrees> out of curiosity, why are you using mutation oberservers for that?
[14:10:04] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor
[14:19:27] <Wilfredor> Im open to any alternative
[14:23:55] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question lol
[14:24:24] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:26:55] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor
[15:49:58] <grid-> $('#overzichten').hide(); wouldn't this hide <section id="overzichten"></section> ?
[15:50:04] <grid-> because it will not hide it
[15:50:11] <robertmaxrees> assuming you only have one
[15:50:27] <grid-> how do you mean?
[15:50:42] <robertmaxrees> do you have more than one element with that ID.
[15:50:45] <robertmaxrees> *>
[15:50:47] <robertmaxrees> **?
[15:50:49] <grid-> no 1
[15:51:25] <robertmaxrees> $('[id=overzichten]').length to be triple sure
[15:55:43] <grid-> sorry i tested locally and i pointed my browser to the remote server
[15:55:45] <grid-> :)
[15:55:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:02:18] <Wilfredor> Its too dificult to fix, thanks guys
[16:03:01] <robertmaxrees> Wilfredor what is?
[16:03:15] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to do stuff when the user types into an input or something?
[16:04:47] <Wilfredor> Actually yes, I had simply made $container.find(':input').on('change''... but I discovered that there are other rare components that are not input
[16:05:01] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[16:05:20] <Wilfredor> components made in an exotic way where I can only listen if the DOM changed
[16:05:45] <robertmaxrees> can you show us instead of being vague and cryptic?
[16:05:48] <Wilfredor> but then that brought me another inconvenience, read how MutationObserver works
[16:06:35] <Wilfredor> I can't create an isolated case, the code is too complex to do it, but I can discuss it in general
[16:06:52] <robertmaxrees> so how are these components made then?
[16:08:47] <Wilfredor> It is a list of items where someone adds or removes items from the list, the items have an icon next to them to remove it and a button below to add a new item to the list. When you click to add a new item, a popover window is displayed that asks for various information, when the window is closed, the list is updated by ajax.
[16:09:00] <robertmaxrees> you just described what the component does.
[16:09:05] <robertmaxrees> not how it's made.
[16:09:54] <Wilfredor> one javascript function removes and another add items to a list that changes the DOM
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> are these "components" made up of divs or inputs or...???
[16:10:47] <Wilfredor> divs
[16:10:50] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:10:59] <robertmaxrees> is this using a library or framework of some kind?
[16:11:03] <Wilfredor> no
[16:11:10] <Wilfredor> just jquery
[16:11:13] <robertmaxrees> so then why not modify the code to do what you want?
[16:11:20] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to use mutationObservers.
[16:11:41] <Wilfredor> That sounds wonderful, but I am not authorized to do that.
[16:11:52] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[16:12:17] <Wilfredor> I tried to do it but the architect said no
[16:12:25] <robertmaxrees> did you ask why not?
[16:13:09] <Wilfredor> the reason, there is a story that depends on it, it is better to correct that quickly without modifying the component because the component is used in multiple places and we do not know the risk of modifying that
[16:13:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> you could modify the component to optionally take callbacks.
[16:13:59] <Wilfredor> it take callbacks
[16:14:31] <robertmaxrees> for the actions you need to respond to?
[19:05:50] <grid-> https://jsfiddle.net/fs7j2r35/
[19:05:59] <grid-> the click event only works on the first linke, how can i bypass this?
[19:06:28] <robertmaxrees> it's an ID.
[19:07:10] <grid-> yes
[19:07:11] <robertmaxrees> can only have an id on a page once.
[19:07:18] <grid-> need a class?
[19:07:19] <grid-> right
[19:07:22] <robertmaxrees> yep
[19:07:22] <grid-> forgotten
[23:36:54] <morenoh11> how can I build a page where one part of the html is shown but when I click a button another part of the html is shown. Kind of like tabs except I'm switching from the first to the second via a button.
[23:38:22] <robertmaxrees> a few different ways - i'd probably check to see if the first section has a "hide" class and, if not, add it, then remove it from the other section.
[23:38:28] <robertmaxrees> or do the inverse if it does.
[23:42:01] <robertmaxrees> morenoh11
[23:42:25] <morenoh11> bootstrap has some display helpers.
[23:42:42] <robertmaxrees> do you already have bootstrap on the page?
[23:42:45] <morenoh11> maybe I just toggle the display on the html sections involved with jq
[23:42:49] <morenoh11> yes
[23:43:08] <morenoh11> I'm open to using jq but would like to avoid jq-ui
[23:43:10] <robertmaxrees> so a few considerations: 1 - don't use "toggle" because it leads to bugs.
[23:43:45] <robertmaxrees> 2 - unless bootstrap has a particular utility method or something, you can do this really trivially.

[23:57:45] <morenoh11> nice
[23:58:44] <robertmaxrees> a freebie for ya ;)
