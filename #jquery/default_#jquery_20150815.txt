[02:33:17] <Mark_2> does anybody know any jquery plugin that spins a layer 180 degree when hover on the layer?
[03:11:13] <Mark_2> does anybody know a jquery tooltip plugin that works like this? http://desimer.com/experiment/
[04:04:29] <pi-> I'm trying `$.fn.disable = -> @disabled = true`, but  `$('#btnRec').disable` isn't disabling the button
[04:04:52] <pi-> I'm not sure if this is a coffeescript or a jquery issue
[04:09:11] <shoky> pi-: that sets the disabled property of the jquery object, not of the wrapped DOM element.  you want $('#btnRect').prop('disabled', true)
[04:12:22] <pi-> shoky: that's what I had. Someone on #coffeescript said I could abstract a disable method.
[04:15:28] <shoky> pi-: you can but you did it wrong. i guess it'd be:  $.fn.disable = -> @prop 'disabled', true
[04:34:15] <Mark_2> is there any better jquery plugin that let me drag around the targeted layer than jquery draggable UI?
[04:34:16] <Mark_2> for instance, i want to give transparency while dragging etc
[05:35:57] <Mark_2> does anybody know how i can give transparency when dragging a window?
[06:57:59] <dude999> hello need some guidance
[06:58:20] <dude999> for file extension validation using jquery
[06:58:28] <dude999> do u have any idea?
[07:19:24] <pi-> http://hastebin.com/ukacapesib.pas <-- I asked this on #coffeescript but maybe someone here knows the answer?
[07:23:32] <shoky> pi-: works fine http://jsfiddle.net/araeay3w/
[07:28:21] <shoky> pi-: .prop was added in jquery 1.6
[07:28:44] <shoky> you can just use .val
[07:28:49] <shoky> or.. upgrade
[07:28:58] <pi-> ah rats. yes. I'm using 1.4.4
[07:29:03] <pi-> Thanks
[07:35:43] <pi-> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery -- is there any reason not to use 2.1.4?
[07:37:02] <Uhkis> ie support
[07:50:20] <pi-> http://pipad.org/midibin_/coffee/create_coffee.html <-- my code is still failing on `$('#header').prop 'value', 'CoffeeScript is alive!'` despite trying latest 1.x and 2.x
[07:53:18] <jak2000> hi all
[07:56:40] <shoky> pi-: <h1> don't have a value.  use .text
[07:56:54] <shoky> pi-: $('#header').text('bla')
[07:57:21] <shoky> value is for inputs
[08:12:01] <pi-> thanks shoky
[08:12:43] <ekz> Hi all
[08:20:00] <jak2000> hi, i have a table with items 1 column of this table is Action (Edit) have a button by each row, then if the user press the button i want get the value of the first column, and set the value in a select/option, i try this: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/fmstp4bb/16/   but not work at momment, any advice how to fix? thanks
[08:21:42] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:30:16] <pi-> `$.fn.disable = -> @prop 'disabled', true`  ...  `$('#btnRec').click => $('#btnRec').disable`
[08:30:31] <pi-> This is still failing.
[08:30:56] <pi-> The function gets invoked, but $('#btnRec').disable is having no effect
[08:32:04] <pi-> That cs should be expanding out to something like $.fn.disable = function(){ this.prop( 'disabled', true ) }
[08:37:27] <rindolf> pi-: what does ` do in JS?
[08:37:53] <rindolf> pi-: or are these your way of quoting code?
[08:37:54] <pi-> rindolf: sorry, I was just quoting code
[08:37:59] <rindolf> pi-: ah.
[08:38:07] <pi-> a la stack overflow / markdown
[08:38:09] <rindolf> pi-: is this CoffeeScript?
[08:38:12] <pi-> yes
[08:38:17] <rindolf> pi-: ah.
[08:38:58] <shoky> pi-: you need to call disable with ()
[08:39:07] <shoky> pi-  $('#btnRect').disable()
[08:40:15] <pi-> wtf that works!  But CS did away with parens. Or so I thought.
[08:41:37] <shoky> pi-  not when calling without arguments
[08:44:39] <pi-> thanks
[08:52:34] <PersonX> howhow do I log the response [console.log] from every ajax call on a random webpage? http://verboselogging.com/2010/02/20/hijack-ajax-requests-like-a-terrorist I guess this would be helpful if we could change it to execute AFTER the call completes

[09:43:30] <AliG1000> How can I alter this so that Ctrl+left or Ctrl+right move left or right (currently the left and right buttons do this): http://jsfiddle.net/pbe4sj9z/
[09:47:47] <AliG1000> it's something like:  case (37 && ctrlKey)  but it doesn't quite work
[09:57:06] <shoky> AliG1000: if (e.keyCode === 37 && e.ctrlKey) { ... }
[09:57:35] <shoky> don't use switch like that, it's gross and bad
[10:01:41] <AliG1000> I'll try that
[10:08:20] <AliG1000> I did alter it, but it didn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/pbe4sj9z/1/
[10:27:11] <shoky> AliG1000: it's running the code in your if. but then you do a switch with default
[10:27:17] <shoky> which returns
[10:27:31] <shoky> don't use a switch, period
[10:27:56] <AliG1000> get rid off all the switches?
[10:27:59] <shoky> yes
[10:37:40] <AliG1000> success.  thank you.  http://jsfiddle.net/pbe4sj9z/3/
[10:43:03] <VictorCL> hi people, can anyone recommend me agood jquery modal library?? that's not jquery UI
[11:28:28] <AliG1000> I can move from cell to cell (Ctrl+left, Ctrl+right, up, down), but I can't now type/edit the content of the cell  http://jsfiddle.net/pbe4sj9z/5/  do I need to put in breaks?  and if so, where?
[13:09:10] <Lencl> for jquery mobile, I do $("#id").popup('close'); $('#id').popup('open');

[14:18:34] <teamcoltra> Hey guys, I am hoping someone can help me brainstorm something.... I have these massive text files that my users read through, right now I just give them a link to a .txt file and they read it that way but I was thinking of maybe creating a web interface for those who want it which would pull the text in using ajax range requests and then as they scroll further it would grab more of the text
[14:19:09] <teamcoltra> maybe even save the section they are on in cookie form so they can come back to it, but I am not sure what the best way of going about this is. Does anyone know of any projects or anything that already does something similar so I can take a look?
[14:20:54] <teamcoltra> I am torn between two big methods of doing it. "pages" where I always give them X number of bytes and then I just add and subtract if they go forward and backwards. This seems like the "easiest" way, but I think for cleaner output the better method would be something like infinite scrolling where when they scroll up the next text is queried and presnted for them
[14:23:52] <Kartagis> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on page prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'bindRemove' <--- what does this mean? how can I fix it? I googled it but...
[14:24:23] <DarkSector> $(document).ajaxStart() how can I know which ajax request is started? I have 2 different sections and two different loaders that I want to show
[14:25:32] <DarkSector> Should I be calling ajaxStart() within the actual call?
[14:33:50] <teamcoltra> Maybe I should do this serverside with some tailing
[14:49:17] <KEHN> hello
[15:22:40] <Zeranoe> how could I remove all newlines in a <div>?
[15:27:01] <rcyr> There's no such thing as "new lines" in HTML, they're converted to whitespace when the document is parsed.
[15:27:40] <rcyr> The only way to have actual newlines is to the the <pre> tag (or white-space: pre)... or have explicit <br>s
[15:29:03] <Zeranoe> rcyr: That;'s correct, and I probably should have been more specific. I'm loading a text file with .load, and then would like to wrap each paragraph (a double newline) in <p> tags
[15:29:38] <rcyr> Can't you just do a string replace in JS?
[15:30:26] <Zeranoe> rcyr: I was thinking replaceall ?
[15:30:42] <rcyr> Zeranoe: You can use .replace with a regex (the g flag)
[15:31:06] <rcyr> 'a a'.replace(/a/g, 'hello');
[15:31:14] <rcyr> Will replace all the 'a' with 'hello'
[15:31:35] <rcyr> Another way to do it would be to use .split
[15:32:32] <Zeranoe> rcyr: The .load() is dumping it into a <div>, how do I get the content of the div to run a string replace on it?
[15:33:17] <rcyr> Just don't use .load
[15:33:40] <rcyr> Can you use $.get?
[15:33:58] <rcyr> Or you could get the data with .html() possibly
[15:36:26] <Zeranoe> rcyr: How would using $.get help with this?
[15:36:48] <rcyr> Zeranoe: You would get to massage the data before adding it to the DOM?
[15:37:10] <Zeranoe> I think .html() might work
[15:37:16] <rcyr> Possibly
[15:37:52] <rcyr> It would look a bit like foo.html('<p>' + foo.html().split('\n\n').join('</p><p>') + '</p>');
[15:38:28] <Zeranoe> rcyr: Since it's using .load wouldn't it still have newlines to search and replace?
[15:39:11] <rcyr> Possibly, I'm not totally sure, that's not how I work.
[15:39:20] <Zeranoe> thus, a split wouldn't need
[15:39:30] <rcyr> Ah ok
[16:29:30] <gr_> hello
[16:45:30] <esaym153> is there a good reference website/app for how to best organize a larger jquery codebase? I have read a couple of books and took the courses at try.jquery.com, but all of it deals with small snippets of code. Right now I am putting the minimum amount of logic in my $(document).ready() block. Most of it is just button listeners that pass data into actual javascript classes/objects that maintain state and have extra methods for t

[18:25:48] <Zeranoe> I'm trying to use jquery's .load() to load a .html file that contains several <p> elements. I keep getting 'junk after document element' in the console. In this example http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_load.asp there was no doctype, but is this needed?

[21:17:57] <Foxhoundz> What is the best way to make a dynamically resized square grids
[21:19:01] <onr> make sure height and width are same
[21:22:27] <Foxhoundz> onr: let me show you an example
[21:22:42] <Foxhoundz> Something like this http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/DraggableImageBoxesGrid/
[21:22:52] <Foxhoundz> but when you resize it, I want the grids to be all visible just downsized
[21:24:58] <onr> Foxhoundz: i feel you can achieve that with CSS only
[21:48:49] <Foxhoundz> onr: I'm trying to make the height and width the same
[21:48:59] <Foxhoundz> I can use percentage to dynamically resize the width of the grid items
[21:49:11] <Foxhoundz> but the height won't change accordingly and thus the image will become squished
[21:49:17] <Foxhoundz> unless you know of a better way
[21:49:20] <Foxhoundz> CSS is not really my forte
[21:49:22] <onr> then don't use percentage?
[21:50:20] <Foxhoundz> onr: and the alternative?
[21:50:26] <onr> rem
[21:50:43] <onr> then make everything float:left
[21:58:49] <Foxhoundz> that didn't work >,>
[23:05:54] <thecoolguy> Why doesn't my timeout trigger the click event ? http://jsfiddle.net/AMsK9/716/
[23:40:46] <vdeep> thecoolguy you are triggering the click event on "document"
[23:40:51] <vdeep> and it is being triggered
[23:41:00] <vdeep> you just don't have any handler for this event
[23:41:25] <vdeep> you can check this by using $(document).click(function(e) { alert("Clicked"); });
