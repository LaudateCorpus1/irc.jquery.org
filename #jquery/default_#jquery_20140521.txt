[00:03:43] <Voyage> I want to make an website scrapper/crawler (which programmatically opens a site, logs in with a user:password, wait for redirects, click links/buttons, submit forms, wait for data fetched by ajax calls, wait for DOM elements to load due to that ajax call, get the source of those created DOM elements,  etc). Can this type of crawler/scrapper be made in javascrip/jquery. (is it a good idea too?). I did such thing in java using selenium and htmlunit http://ht
[00:03:44] <Voyage> mlunit.sourceforge.net/
[00:04:27] <Cork> Voyage: depends
[00:04:39] <Cork> yes it can be done in js, no it can't be made in content js
[00:04:59] <Cork> Voyage: but privileged js could do it
[00:05:29] <Voyage> priviledged?
[00:05:55] <Cork> Voyage: extensions or in-browser js
[00:06:04] <Cork> meaning not js loaded from a webpage
[00:06:33] <Cork> greasemonkey scripts could do it too
[00:06:58] <Voyage> Cork,    if i do all that in an iframe, and load my script at the bottom , use jquery for shorthand. and do all that on a browser like firefox. will that be a sane idea?
[00:07:06] <Cork> about if it is a good idea, well if you need js to run automating a browser is basically your only option
[00:07:17] <Cork> Voyage: no
[00:07:35] <Cork> Voyage: your js won't be allowed to access the content inside the iframe
[00:07:37] <ophi491> im making a chrome extension and CORS/async methods are killing me, but i am a newb
[00:07:55] <ophi491> you can use postMessage to get the data from an iframe
[00:08:10] <Cork> ophi491: only if you control the other servers
[00:08:19] <Cork> ophi491: and if you do, then you have no need for a spider
[00:08:33] <ophi491> oh is he loading a site into an iframe?
[00:08:37] <Cork> so no iframes isn't a solution
[00:08:48] <Cork> ophi491: he is trying to make a web spider
[00:09:53] <Voyage> Cork,  why not. iframe with id="iframe" var = html = $("#iframe").html()
[00:10:08] <Cork> Voyage: cause it would be xss
[00:10:13] <Voyage> xss?
[00:10:14] <Cork> and the browser is blocking that
[00:10:21] <Cork> Cross Site Scripting
[00:10:35] <Cork> Voyage: if the browser would allow that
[00:10:54] <Cork> Voyage:  a page could load a hidden iframe pointing to g+ or facebook or twitter
[00:11:04] <Cork> and through it grab your contacts, address, password...
[00:11:22] <Cork> so that kind of access is blocked
[00:13:05] <Voyage> Cork,  you are sure on that?\
[00:13:17] <ophi491> i am loading an iframe of a .js file that makes cross origin requests
[00:13:47] <Voyage> ophi491,  and you are successfull in that?
[00:13:51] <Cork> Voyage: completely
[00:14:21] <Cork> Voyage: you can't do cross origin access unless the other end explicitly allows it
[00:14:59] <Cork> Voyage: or your code is privileged in the browser (meaning not restricted to the same domain) == extensions
[00:15:48] <Voyage> Cork,  "other end"?
[00:15:59] <ophi491> i am using a cors proxy
[00:16:20] <ophi491> https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
[00:16:31] <Cork> well ok
[00:16:39] <Cork> sure you can have server scripts do the spidering
[00:16:43] <Cork> and then sending it to you
[00:16:49] <Cork> but that won't work if you need js to run
[00:17:11] <Cork> ophi491: read up on the original question
[00:17:31] <Cork> Voyage: the server you want to spider has to explicitly allow cors requests
[00:17:51] <Cork> Voyage: it is a header the server sets in every http response
[00:18:51] <Voyage> ophi491,  what does that cores proxy provide you? its amazing if you are able to do anti " same origin policy"
[00:19:03] <Cork> Voyage: it isn't
[00:19:18] <Cork> Voyage: as the server does the requests it won't have your ip OR your cookies
[00:19:28] <Cork> so it won't get the logged in pages
[00:19:39] <Cork> so there is no cors risk with it
[00:19:44] <Voyage> oh
[00:19:55] <Cork> also the spider happens server side
[00:20:05] <Cork> so 1. no dom, 2. no js, 3. no image loading
[00:20:06] <Voyage> k
[00:20:27] <Cork> though images isn't blocked in cors so you can load them when you get the html
[00:20:35] <Voyage> oops
[00:20:38] <Voyage> what options do I have?
[00:20:59] <Cork> Voyage: like i said first extensions or greasmonkey
[00:21:11] <Cork> webpage based js can't do it
[00:21:14] <Cork> by design
[00:22:35] <Voyage> hm
[00:27:46] <Voyage> ok. bottom line: I want to login to some 3 or 4 websites, submit some forms, wait for redirects, wait for ajax response, dom elements be created, get that data and show/use it.
[00:29:13] <Voyage> Cork,  phantom looks obvious . right?^
[00:29:21] <Voyage> or selenium with php?
[00:29:56] <Cork> Voyage: you would still hit the same limitations
[00:30:15] <Cork> selenium is still running in the context you load it
[00:30:36] <Cork> Voyage: that said you might be able to do what you want with node.js
[00:31:01] <Voyage> Cork,  no. selenium would just load the entire page. do stuff. close it. so no cross domain issu
[00:31:35] <Cork> Voyage: what i meant selenium would still have to run either as privileged code
[00:31:44] <Cork> or loaded form the domain you want to load
[00:32:03] <Cork> unless again you run it in server code that doesn't have this restriction
[00:33:18] <Voyage> actually, to be honest, iam a java dev and i have successfully done it in selenium. today the issue was that theres a new project and the new guy dont know java.
[00:33:35] <abishek> how can i have a section-detail move smoothly instead of jumping http://jsbin.com/sogaj/2/edit. Section1 and Section 2 are of different heights because of which section-detail jumps up and down. Is there a way to smoothen this?
[00:33:37] <Voyage> and I doubt it would be good in php+selenium
[00:34:15] <Cork> Voyage: selenium is a set of commands to automate actions
[00:34:33] <Cork> Voyage: it doesn't by definition allow cross domain talks
[00:34:40] <Cork> that restriction depends on where it runs
[00:34:47] <Cork> yes, if you run it in java you don't have cors
[00:34:53] <Cork> so selenium isn't limited to cors
[00:35:06] <Cork> Voyage: THAT is what i meant
[00:36:14] <Voyage> hm
[00:36:31] <Cork> abishek: you could add a wrapper and give it a fixed height
[00:36:45] <Cork> abishek: then animate it to the height of the new element
[00:37:09] <Cork> abishek: but no there isn't a built in function to animate a transition like that
[00:38:26] <Cork> Voyage: another way to express the same thing
[00:38:46] <Cork> Voyage: js isn't limiting your requests to cors, the browser that runs js does
[00:39:10] <Voyage> hm
[00:39:57] <abishek> Cork, add a wrapper, did you mean to the section-detail or both section1 and section2?
[00:40:51] <Cork> abishek: you would have to put it around the "row" elements holding section1 and 2
[00:49:31] <aro> are there any good list filter plugins that add animation?
[00:50:18] <Cork> eeh..
[00:50:25] <Cork> why would you want animation on that?
[00:50:33] <Cork> it would just make the filtering sluggish
[00:50:35] <aro> kinda like modernizr or masonry
[00:50:46] <aro> just the animation of removing/adding elements
[00:54:56] <aro> is there such a tool?
[00:56:24] <Cork> aro: donno about one, but it should be trivial to do it with jquery ui autocomplete + jquerys fadeOut/In
[00:59:13] <larsemil> when i hide an element it hides to left top. i would like it to hide from bottom to top. how to achieve this?
[00:59:40] <Cork> larsemil: SlideUp?
[00:59:47] <Cork> ?slideUp
[00:59:56] * Cork kicks b-ot
[01:00:05] <larsemil> that was easy. perfect
[01:00:08] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[01:00:30] <larsemil> perfect
[01:00:38] <larsemil> thanks
[01:11:14] <dwarder> guys anyone uses handlebars?
[01:11:17] <dwarder> http://assemble.io/helpers/
[01:11:28] <dwarder> is it possible to use not with node.js
[01:11:34] <t16h> yah
[01:13:24] <dwarder> t16h: there are no docs on using 'assemble' without node js
[01:13:57] <t16h> looking at assemble, not familiar...
[01:16:12] <t16h> so, if i'm not misunderstanding, assemble is a static site generator type thing
[01:16:23] <t16h> that uses node.js to generate static sites
[01:17:39] <dwarder> i want more helpers with hanldebars
[01:17:57] <dwarder> that is all i want
[01:18:43] <t16h> and the handlebars js site is not sufficient? the docs are kind of bad...
[02:25:30] <Mateo_> Hi everyone
[02:26:42] <Mateo_> I’m looking for a specific event in Jqm. I’d like to record a sound when a button is pressed (and remain pressed), then stop when released.
[02:27:10] <Mateo_> I’m trying to use taphold, but I can’t find the event to fire when the button is released.
[02:33:55] <seutje> Mateo_: by default, I believe tap fires after taphold is released
[02:36:03] <Simon__> anybody experienced in the jquery code of "tablesorter" its kind of a newbie question? ;-) because: http://jsfiddle.net/9kwQ7/ with this code the tablesorter is working like acharm but the "zebra" widget gets active afetr the first sorting click
[02:36:24] <Simon__> so i have no zebra effekt till i press any header to sort
[02:37:25] <Cork> Simon__: simplest might be to just implement the line coloring in css and leave js out of that part
[02:38:13] <Cork> never used the tablesorter plugin so not sure what might be the cause of your problems
[02:39:11] <Simon__> any tutorial how to implement odd and even classes in a table with 100+ <tr>
[02:39:21] <Simon__> without doing it by hand^^
[02:39:49] <Cork> ?g mdn nth-child
[02:39:50] <b-ot> Cork: :nth-child - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child
[02:40:04] <Simon__> thx
[02:40:10] <Cork> (specifically odd and even)
[02:40:44] <Cork> Simon__: it requires ie9
[02:41:07] <Cork> so if you need the coloring in ie8 or older you might have to use a script for them
[02:42:33] <Mateo_> seutje: Ok, I’m going to try and look.
[02:45:07] <Kelam> hi
[02:45:29] <seutje> Simon__: I don't rly see the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/9kwQ7/2/
[02:47:23] <Simon__> i donnot see the problem also
[02:47:43] <Simon__> the only difference i have, is that the table is loading in an accordeon effekt
[02:47:59] <Simon__> so the 2 jquery plugins may interference perhaps
[02:48:12] <Simon__> the autosort funktion is ok
[02:48:20] <seutje> is the table in the page when you query for it?
[02:48:36] <Simon__> its a php include script
[02:48:48] <Simon__> but no difference if i place it behind or before
[02:48:55] <Simon__> wanna see it live?
[02:49:14] <seutje> sure, but I'ma grab some coffee first :P
[02:49:23] <Kelam> :D
[02:49:37] <Simon__> one moment uploading^^
[02:50:42] <Simon__> http://tc-ruhmannsfelden.de/hauptlinks/halloffame.php , the first acordeon
[02:50:55] <Simon__> the top one, i mean
[02:51:20] <Simon__> and sorry for the bad design it is my first try to make a homepage from the scrap so i am a total noob ;)
[02:58:18] <skullcrasher> is there something like a delegate selctor?
[02:58:23] <skullcrasher> just like for events
[02:58:40] <skullcrasher> if a new element (ajax) is appended the selector works?
[02:59:35] <seutje> Simon__: oh boy...
[02:59:52] <seutje> really shouldn't just drop blocks of inline JS in the page
[02:59:58] <skullcrasher> specific for draggables
[03:00:22] <Cork> skullcrasher: no, selectors (if you mean $('selector')) builds an array of matches when it runs
[03:00:29] <Cork> skullcrasher: it can't magically update this list
[03:00:33] <skullcrasher> ok
[03:00:38] <Simon__> oh ok, but there are only this 2 ;-)
[03:00:42] <skullcrasher> so callback and reinit is necessary
[03:00:46] <BaNzounet> Hey, If I do something like var bar = $('.foo').find('.bar') can I use bar to do stuff like $(bar, '.dummy').click() if yes what's the correct synthax?
[03:00:51] <Cork> skullcrasher: yes
[03:00:58] <skullcrasher> ok thx :)
[03:01:02] <Simon__> thought it should work before i outsource them ,-)
[03:01:28] <Cork> BaNzounet: exactly what you wrote should work
[03:01:36] <Cork> or actually
[03:01:38] <Cork> lol sorry
[03:01:46] <Cork> $('.dummy', bar).click()
[03:02:00] <Cork> or $(bar).find('.dummy').click()
[03:02:13] <Cork> *bar.find('.dummy').click()
[03:02:17] <seutje> Simon__: well, I can't easily add breakpoints to inline scripts, and I can't secretly swap them out for slightly altered local versions
[03:02:54] <Simon__> ? sry i donnot know what you mean
[03:02:57] <seutje> Simon__: thing is, ur targetting *all* tables in the page with the one call
[03:03:34] <uskerine> in datatables, is it possible to have a generic definition (based for example on container div class) for formatting and then specify different data sources for each table based on the specific ID?
[03:04:40] <Simon__> even with an unique id it is the same problem
[03:04:50] <Simon__> like: $("#myTable").tablesorter({
[03:05:18] <seutje> Simon__: yeah, looks like it just refuses to add the classes if the elements aren't visible
[03:05:18] <Simon__> and only 1 table with this id ofc
[03:06:38] <Simon__> so i should add css style to the original table and let the tablesorter make it after "click"?
[03:08:04] <seutje> this seems to work: $('.toggle_container').css('display', 'block').find('table.tablesorter').tablesorter({ widgets: ['zebra'], sortList: [[0,1]] }).end().css('display', 'none');
[03:08:17] <seutje> but that's obviously kinda naive and silly
[03:10:17] <seutje> I guess it excludes invisible elements so the zebra-striping would work out properly when certain rows are being hidden
[03:10:38] <seutje> in that case, even nth-child won't save you
[03:10:52] <Mateo_> Hmm I can’t get to have the touchstart triggered :/ Any idea why ? https://gist.github.com/KuneStudio/c9165b3e43cd963ff000
[03:10:57] <Mateo_> I’m probably missing something
[03:11:04] <seutje> Simon__: see https://github.com/christianbach/tablesorter/blob/master/jquery.tablesorter.js#L1016
[03:12:01] <Simon__> ah ok it loops through only visible rows...
[03:15:22] <seutje> Mateo_: this is a specific device/platform? cause android had problems catching touchstart before the user performed some sort of scroll or zoom action
[03:15:59] <Mateo_> seutje: It’s tested on iOS but I hope to make it availible on Android too
[03:17:31] <BaNzounet> Cork: thanks ;)
[03:19:24] <seutje> Mateo_: so it works fine on iOS but borks on android?
[03:20:19] <Mateo_> seutje: No, I’m testing this code on iOS and it isn’t working. Well, the touchstart events are not triggered, the console.log("GotFS()"); is display.
[03:21:09] <seutje> Mateo_: lol, when I hear "It's tested on X", it sounds like it works on X, but alright...
[03:21:41] <Mateo_> seutje: oh ok sorry, I misunderstood … (french here ^^)
[03:22:17] <seutje> Mateo_: so you don't even know if the success callback for getFile gets called at all?
[03:23:37] <Mateo_> seutje: The file is created, the line $("#wavPath").html("<strong>File … is triggered
[03:24:13] <Mateo_> It is the touch events that are not triggered , the rest looks like to work fine
[03:25:37] <Mateo_> Let’s see if I replace on by bind
[03:31:44] <Mateo_> seutje: looks like it’s working with bind.
[03:43:53] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:44:38] <jomofcw> i'm using .ajax. In my success callback, I'mdoing a console.log($(data).html()) that display lme an "undefined" whereas the data is a correct HTML. Why ?
[03:51:43] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:51:44] <jomofcw> i'm using .ajax. In my success callback, I'mdoing a console.log($(data).html()) that display lme an "undefined" whereas the data is a correct HTML. Why ?
[03:52:23] <slax0r> jomofcw: because you're doing it wrong :)
[03:52:40] <slax0r> if data is the html, why smack it in as a selector and try to get it's html with .html?
[03:52:44] <slax0r> log just data
[04:09:08] <ophi491> if i wrap code at the start of the file like - var myVar = (function(){ //...})()  - isnt myVar still a global variable?
[04:09:22] <Cork> ophi491: yes
[04:09:41] <Cork> but it would be undefined unless you return something from the function
[04:10:13] <ophi491> so is this method used to cut down on how many global variables you have?
[04:10:33] <Cork> var myVar =  is rarely used in this context
[04:10:39] <Cork> (function() {})() is though
[04:10:54] <Cork> and yes it makes a namescope
[04:11:34] <Cork> (function() { var myVar = 1; })(); alert(myVar) // Error
[04:11:47] <ophi491> would I just wrap an entire file in a function like that?
[04:12:19] <ophi491> I want a variable I can update easily throught my code
[04:12:22] <Cork> ophi491: depends on what you want to do, but yes you can
[04:12:48] <Cork> that would make a "private" namespace for your code
[04:13:29] <ophi491> I am just not sure if that is frowned upon or something, it seems like cheating
[04:13:43] <Cork> ophi491: it isn't
[04:13:48] <Cork> it is quite commonly used
[04:13:56] <Cork> check jquery.js for an example
[04:14:16] <ophi491> ok awesome
[04:14:24] <ophi491> Thanks
[04:14:51] <Cork> what jquery does is a little bit more advanced
[04:15:03] <Cork> as it passes global variables in as arguments
[04:15:12] <Cork> so that minification can find window and document
[04:15:31] <Voyage> Cork,  can I use phantom (integrate it) in my desktop made app?
[04:15:50] <ophi491> ok
[04:15:53] <Cork> ophi491: (function(window, document) { })(window, document);
[04:16:19] <Cork> but ya it is basically the same thing
[04:16:54] <Cork> oh, interesting
[04:17:07] <Cork> they have made it even more complex in newer version ^^'
[04:17:19] <Cork> Voyage: donno, possibly
[04:18:14] <Bheam> yo
[04:18:21] <Bheam> how do i make my own :selector in jquery?
[04:18:53] <Bheam> so i can $(this).closest(':superduper')
[04:19:11] <beancurd> wut.
[04:19:13] <seutje> extend $.expr
[04:19:18] <seutje> Bheam: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[04:19:42] <ophi491> i cant believe how much easier this wrapping thing will make everything
[05:03:15] <jomofcw> slax0r because i need then to use the jQuery obejct to search part of the HTML like $(dataFromAjax).find('#myID'), but it doesn't find anything whereas the element #myID exists.
[05:03:48] <slax0r> jomofcw: ?
[05:04:12] <slax0r> oh
[05:04:14] <slax0r> that's you :P
[05:04:38] <slax0r> if you console.log just the data, without .html or $(), does it show any html?
[05:04:56] <jomofcw> in other words : dataFromAjax contain a full html pag with an element like that : '<div id="myID"></div>', so why $(dataFromAjax).find('#myID').length return 0.
[05:05:08] <jomofcw> slax0r yes, it does.
[05:05:31] <DarsVaeda> I have "<a>..</a><input />" and do "$('a').closest('input')" but it gives an empty object, why might this be?
[05:05:52] <jomofcw> DarsVaeda closest work with parents
[05:06:08] <slax0r> jomofcw: can you try something like: var html = $(yourdata); var elem = $("#myID", html);
[05:06:08] <jomofcw> DarsVaeda you need next or nextAll in your case.
[05:06:20] <DarsVaeda> oh okay :/
[05:06:23] <slax0r> DarsVaeda: or siblings
[05:06:36] <DarsVaeda> and what if you do not know if it is parent or on the same level?
[05:06:56] <slax0r> DarsVaeda: go with siblings, if it doesn't find, use closest
[05:07:09] <DarsVaeda> ok thx
[05:07:58] <jomofcw> slax0r : same result :/.
[05:08:18] <jomofcw> DarsVaeda slax0r is right, siblings is better in your case.
[05:09:57] <DarsVaeda> they are all not the best solution
[05:10:33] <DarsVaeda> if I suddenly have two input siblings will not work so I have to use next, but if I swap a and input I would have to use prev...so hmm
[05:11:05] <jomofcw> DarsVaeda there is not "native/core" function to do it.
[05:13:10] <DarsVaeda> I guess I will choose next then as it will just not work if you swap it but not give strange results
[05:13:35] <jomofcw> So you should use a mix of siblings/nextAll/prevAll/closest function and :first selector imo.
[05:14:06] <DarsVaeda> right, but not today :P
[05:14:11] <jomofcw> DarsVaeda ;).
[05:14:17] <jomofcw> It's up to U.
[05:14:20] <dwarder> if i add <style> with styles to my html using javascript will it take effect on the elements ?
[05:14:27] <Cork> DarsVaeda: is $(this).nextAll('input').first() work for you?
[05:14:45] <Cork> uh.. *ok for you
[05:15:12] <Cork> dwarder: it will in modern browsers
[05:15:28] <Cork> dwarder: how it effects the elements differ though
[05:15:29] <MikeD_> is it possible to unset a radio button?
[05:15:42] <Cork> as they have added scoped styles
[05:15:54] <Cork> so browsers that support that limit the scope of the style tag
[05:16:10] <Cork> MikeD_: yes, though you normally shouldn't
[05:16:24] <Cork> MikeD_: if you ever need to your most likely using a radio button wrong
[05:16:38] <Cork> MikeD_: prop('checked', false)
[05:16:49] <Cork> *you're
[05:16:53] <MikeD_> i agree - however, the as-is system is old-school VB craziness.. and the customer wants web pages that work "just like what we're used to"
[05:17:12] <Cork> yay...
[05:17:24] <Cork> MikeD_: how about using a checkbox and styling it? :D
[05:17:26] <MikeD_> hah, yep
[05:17:30] <seutje> same shit different day, right? :P
[05:17:46] <MikeD_> you can style a checkbox into a circle?
[05:17:56] <Cork> MikeD_: kinda
[05:17:57] <seutje> on new browsers, sure
[05:18:22] <MikeD_> they also use checkboxes wrong... having a group of them where checking one of the boxes unchecks the others
[05:18:59] <MikeD_> oh sure, we can make bad UI it'll just take 5x as long to write all the custom code to make it "work"
[05:19:36] <MikeD_> oh well, if the last team built it right in the first place I wouldn't have this job
[05:20:11] <seutje> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/sYZ7W/
[05:20:14] <Cork> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/evvMF/
[05:20:24] <seutje> you can't :before or :after input elements though :(
[05:20:31] <Cork> seutje: mine looks native! ;P
[05:20:46] <seutje> oooh, u wanted it to look like a radio... guess I should have read everything
[05:21:06] <seutje> all I caught was that it needed to be like a circle :P
[05:21:14] <Cork> ^^
[05:21:16] <dwarder> Cork: thanks
[05:21:36] <Cork> appearance is fun
[05:21:39] <Cork> dwarder: np
[05:21:48] <MikeD_> Firefox 29.0.1 doesn't make that checkbox look like a circle
[05:22:34] <Cork> MikeD_: hmm it does here
[05:23:11] <MikeD_> i mean seutje's version
[05:23:16] <Cork> ah
[05:23:38] <seutje> I didn't prefix border radius
[05:23:50] <seutje> but I pretended appearance was standard already!
[05:24:14] <MikeD_> it's an interesting oddity, but another one of those "you CAN, but you SHOULDN'T"
[05:24:28] <Cork> seutje: firefox doens't use prefixed border-radious
[05:24:38] <seutje> oh
[05:25:24] <seutje> wait, does FF still suck balls at border-radius in %?
[05:25:27] <MikeD_> why does jsfiddle sometimes not let me highlight & copy the html?
[05:25:41] <seutje> it can be a lil prick like that, sometimes
[05:25:51] <Cork> seutje: never had a problem with it
[05:27:03] <Cork> seutje: but firefox is quite picky about what it lets you do to form elements
[05:27:17] <seutje> tell me about it
[05:27:20] <Cork> and apparently border-radios isn't allowed on checkboxes
[05:27:31] <seutje> they still have the line-height set in stone for text fields?
[05:27:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/sYZ7W/1/
[05:27:51] <Cork> seutje: what?
[05:27:56] <seutje> lol
[05:28:29] <Cork> seutje: i have to add hacks to get chrome to calculate the height correctly for input fields with line-height != 1
[05:28:50] <Cork> but i haven't seen any errors from firefox
[05:29:40] <Cork> i have to add a max-height to chromes input fields just to get it to give the field the correct height
[05:32:25] <seutje> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/vQS2j/1/
[05:32:43] <Cork> ok?
[05:33:02] <Cork> get the same value from chromium and firefox
[05:33:07] <Cork> what am i suppose to see?
[05:33:50] <Verbeurk> go a;;
[05:33:53] <Verbeurk> hi all
[05:34:02] <Verbeurk> i have a problem with deferred. anyone can take a look ?
[05:34:03] <seutje> Cork: firefox completely ignore it
[05:34:08] <seutje> ignores*
[05:34:16] <Cork> seutje: i get 900px in the alert
[05:34:24] <seutje> whatever http://jsfiddle.net/vQS2j/2 method http://jsfiddle.net/vQS2j/3 I try http://jsfiddle.net/vQS2j/4
[05:34:28] <seutje> I always get "14px"
[05:34:34] <Cork> and the input looks similar except for styling
[05:35:02] <seutje> I'm still on 28 though
[05:35:22] <Cork> seutje: ah, hmm interesting
[05:35:44] <Cork> seutje: i think what you see might be fixed in ff30
[05:35:56] <seutje> it has this in the UA stylesheet: line-height: normal !important;
[05:36:01] <Cork> they fixed the overflow area then
[05:36:09] <seutje> important... in the UA stylesheet!!!1one
[05:36:28] <Cork> seutje: they use important quite a few things in there
[05:36:33] <seutje> it's been like that forever though
[05:36:46] <Cork> never experienced it before now
[05:37:03] <seutje> it's one of those things you remember and avoid at all cost once you've hit it :P
[05:37:34] <seutje> cause even throwing JS at it wouldn't help
[05:37:44] <Cork> ya
[05:37:51] <Cork> anyway it is fixed :)
[05:38:00] <Cork> *move along* ;)
[05:40:00] <Cork> seutje: donno if i've shown you this one? http://jsfiddle.net/eE5Rc/2/
[05:40:06] <slax0r> what's wrong with important? :P
[05:40:40] <seutje> lolwat?
[05:40:52] <Cork> i love that rendering bug ^^
[05:41:16] <seutje> go home link, ur drunk
[05:41:43] <seutje> Cork: u mean the link moving along right?
[05:41:44] <Mateo_> Ah ah. There’s something wrong
[05:42:07] <seutje> Cork: or the parens not moving along?
[05:42:15] <seutje> cause that makes sense with the vertical-align
[05:42:26] <seutje> xcept, my FF 28 doesn't seem to agree
[05:42:28] <Cork> seutje: exactly
[05:42:59] <Cork> seutje: no the parenthesis is on the same static line
[05:43:03] <Cork> so it SHOULD move along
[05:43:12] <Cork> webkit borks it though
[05:44:31] <Cork> seutje: vertical-align: top; aligns elements to the top of each other
[05:44:36] <Cork> margin isn't included in that
[05:44:53] <Cork> so all the inline text should be in one long line
[05:45:01] <Cork> pushed down by the inline-blocks margin-top
[05:45:42] <Cork> though that said, it lets you do quite cool animations in chrome for close to free :)
[05:54:12] <seutje> oh right, it's a margin, lol
[05:54:49] <seutje> Cork: add any wrapping element and it's fixed though
[05:55:03] <Cork> seutje: sure
[05:55:11] <seutje> even an inline wrapper
[05:55:15] <Cork> seutje: and that is what i've done to work around the bug
[05:55:17] <seutje> webs: u weird!
[06:01:38] <MikeD_> that's a neat example - if you blogged about it though it should have some commentary about how/why the link is moving despite there being no animation outside b
[06:01:55] <Cork> true :)
[06:03:22] <MikeD_> it's unintuitive but arguably the correct behavior
[06:03:51] <Cork> MikeD_: the animation is to show the weirdness
[06:04:12] <MikeD_> yeah, that's just eye-candy :)
[06:04:15] <Cork> in reality it was <label></label>(<a href="">help</a>)
[06:04:26] <Cork> and i got the weird parenthesis bug
[06:04:45] <seutje> what, no form wrapper? :P
[06:04:48] * seutje hides
[06:04:50] <MikeD_> what's the parenthesis bug?
[06:04:51] <Cork> lol
[06:04:59] <Cork> MikeD_: the demo
[06:05:02] <seutje> the parens not moving along in chrome
[06:05:25] <MikeD_> oh, firefox 29 is moving the parenthesis just fine
[06:05:27] <Cork> well in webkit
[06:05:31] <Cork> it isn't chrome specific
[06:05:32] <Crucials> im so, so, stupid
[06:06:05] <Crucials> was trying to script some things for this checkbox
[06:06:15] <Crucials> left to get something to eat, realized i was just trying to make a radio button
[06:06:52] <MikeD_> radio button: a special-case checkbox
[06:07:02] <Cork> :)
[06:08:21] <JurassicTriassic> Hi. Can I use jquery.load() to load an entire single-page-application (one html page with a lot of script references and links to other html templates) into a div in another web project?
[06:08:54] <MikeD_> i'm surprised we don't have a multi-pick drop-down... because the "remember to hold CTRL when you click" pretty much made that native option unusable for 90% of  web users
[06:09:00] <Cork> JurassicTriassic: you can,but it will most likely not work
[06:09:26] <aro> is there a way to use masonry so that it goes top down instead of left to right?
[06:09:40] <MikeD_> JurassicTriassic: why not just use location = 'thenewpage' and let the normal case of loading a page work as intended?
[06:09:41] <Bauer> hey Cork :) can you help me again please? I have a form submit that targets an iframe, which I want to remove (the iframe) AFTER submission is completed successfully, and it does not work. I tried to use promises to ensure I remove it AFTER form.submit is done, but it still is not working, and I cant figure out why... here is the code: http://jsbin.com/rugufanu/1/
[06:10:03] <Cork> MikeD_: blame the systems there, they don't have multi pickers, so neither does the web
[06:10:55] <Cork> Bauer: you can't do anything after a normal http form submit
[06:11:04] <dan2k3k4> bxslider working fine on chrome but not on IE... seems to not set width for the images (sets to 0 per image)
[06:11:05] <Bauer> Cork: why not?
[06:11:08] <Cork> Bauer: the page you're running is closed
[06:11:21] <MikeD_> <select multiple> has always been unpleasant
[06:11:25] <Bauer> Cork: it is NOT closed, as my target of the form, is an IFRAME
[06:11:28] <Cork> Bauer: when the post happens and the response comes back the page is unloaded
[06:11:51] <Cork> Bauer: the fact is basically still the same
[06:12:08] <Cork> Bauer: you can from the parent listen for an unload event from the page in the iframe
[06:12:16] <Cork> but there isn't an after submit
[06:12:20] <dan2k3k4> it seems to load fine in IE but sets images to width 0 :/
[06:13:07] <Bauer> Cork: ok, the iframe is rendered empty exactly to allow the submit to target it. How do I listen for its 'unload' event then?
[06:14:09] <Cork> Bauer: $('iframe').contents().on('unload', function() { alert('page unloading'); })
[06:14:18] <MikeD_> targeting an iframe with a form seems weird
[06:14:39] <Cork> ah wait i misunderstood what you meant target
[06:14:45] <Cork> then ya, unload won't help
[06:15:07] <Cork> Bauer: the best way for you to handle it would be to send a small js in the response
[06:15:17] <MikeD_> if you're trying to fake an ajax submission, just DO an ajax form submit :)
[06:15:26] <Cork> that does something like window.parent.<function to tell it has completed>()
[06:15:37] <Cork> true
[06:15:54] <Cork> the only reason to do iframe ajax is if you need old ie file upload support
[06:16:09] <Bauer> Cork: I cant control the response of the form, it sends back session data, and I want to remove the session IFRAME, before I open a new tab, where user can be logged into the system
[06:16:20] <MikeD_> and that reason is growing weaker every month
[06:16:22] <dan2k3k4> bxslider seems to set width: auto for the slider, then width: 0 for each slide on IE...
[06:16:47] <Cork> Bauer: you could try binding a .load event on the iframe
[06:17:13] <Cork> as it is technically loading the response from the form submission that should work
[06:17:28] <Cork> but ya, i haven't used iframes in many years
[06:17:52] <Cork> so i have forgotten most of the kinky dinky you need to get things like this working
[06:18:14] <Bauer> hmmmm, interesting idea! so you say my best way to do it, is to bind to .load event inside the iframe, and once received, clear iframe's DOM from inside?
[06:18:28] <Cork> Bauer: not inside
[06:18:31] <Cork> on the iframe
[06:19:20] <Cork> <form target="my-iframe"></form> <iframe id="my-iframe></iframe> <script>$('#my-iframe').load(function() {});</script>
[06:19:22] <Bauer> Cork: as in $('iframe').bind('load', function () { stuff to do })?
[06:19:28] <Cork> ya
[06:20:49] <Bauer> thanks Cork, I will try that now :) but question still remains - why is my code not working? scripts execution in parent does not stop when form is submitted into iframe.. so why cant I do what I did with .done?
[06:21:14] <Cork> Bauer: cause events isn't a deferred
[06:21:27] <Cork> so you bind $.when(undefined)
[06:21:35] <Cork> so nothing happens
[06:23:58] <BillCriswell> Do any of you happen to know if there's a way to pin a tab in Chrome through a keyboard shortcut?
[06:24:40] <BillCriswell> It's like the only thing involving the browser chrome I need to use regularly that there doesn't seem to be a shortcut for.
[06:26:58] <Bauer> Cork: well, I just tried adapting this: http://jsbin.com/rugufanu/1/edit and it does not seem to be triggered :(
[06:27:09] <Bauer> frame and form are still intact
[06:27:19] <Bauer> nor breakpoint was triggered
[06:27:51] <Cork> Bauer: you missed the #
[06:28:05] <Bauer> ohh, the copy/paste devils... :)
[06:32:44] <Bauer> it works!! it works!! thanks Cork :) I still however, am not wiser to how I could have come up with this solution myself :/ how could have I known that form.submit is not returning a deferred object for example? is there a list of deferred objects?
[06:33:28] <Cork> Bauer: deferred objects is things jquery manages
[06:33:48] <Cork> Bauer: but basically animations and ajax is the two things that use deferred
[06:44:27] <nszceta> I am looking for the most up-to-date reference/cheat sheet regarding HTML5/CSS
[06:46:57] <dan2k3k4> uhhh fixed bxslider by forcing the width in css :/
[06:47:43] <MikeD_> nszceta: you mean spec?
[06:47:50] <Cork> nszceta: http://www.whatwg.org/html and http://wiki.csswg.org/spec
[06:47:58] <Cork> it doesn't get more up to date then that :)
[06:48:12] <nszceta> thanks Cork MikeD_
[06:48:27] <nszceta> Cork well of course it does
[06:48:36] <nszceta> Cork chrome/firefox source code is the ultimate reference ;)
[06:48:43] <Cork> nszceta: no it isn't
[06:48:50] <Cork> cause those are what the browsers has implemented
[06:49:22] <nszceta> not always
[06:49:28] <Cork> including none standard parts
[06:49:29] <nszceta> "The ones that win are the ones that ship." http://diveintohtml5.info/past.html
[06:49:48] <Cork> nszceta: that isn't true
[06:49:53] <thoraxe> nszceta: you asked for the most up to date. the spec is the most up to date
[06:49:59] <nszceta> thanks thoraxe
[06:50:08] <nszceta> and I agree that it is the best readable source
[06:50:08] <thoraxe> nszceta: if the browser has or has not implemented it, that is tangential to your question :P
[06:50:11] <nszceta> :P
[06:50:26] <Cork> nszceta: a proposition doesn't becomes a standard until two of the main browsers implement it
[06:50:27] <thaifood> hi
[06:50:30] <Cork> (in the same way)
[06:50:33] <nszceta> very interesting
[06:50:51] <thaifood> how can i get the filename from these many images when one is  clicked please?  http://fpaste.org/103794/80016140/
[06:51:29] <Cork> thaifood: you would have to grab the src attribute
[06:51:49] <Cork> and extract what you can guess is the "filename"
[06:51:55] <Cork> note though urls doesn't have filename
[06:52:00] <thaifood> Cork:  thanks but how to get the one for a group
[06:52:05] <beancurd> something along the lines of this attr("src") then get the url.
[06:52:11] <Cork> thaifood: a group?
[06:52:20] <seutje> like, map?
[06:52:22] <thaifood> i'm displaying many images
[06:52:26] <Cork> you mean you want them all as soon as any of them are clicked?
[06:52:30] <beancurd> $("img").attr("src");
[06:52:31] <thaifood> and want to know which is clicked
[06:52:36] <beancurd> oh .click.
[06:52:44] <thaifood> yes please
[06:52:53] <seutje> $('img').map(function() { return $(this).attr('src'); }); ?
[06:53:15] <Cork> thaifood: $(parent).on('click', 'img', function() { $(this).attr('src'); })
[06:53:24] <Cork> no need to have them all if you want the target one only
[06:53:51] <seutje> oh
[06:53:54] <thaifood> thanks i'll try it now
[06:53:59] <seutje> (parent being a reference to a parent element btw)
[06:54:03] <thaifood> yes
[06:55:00] <JurassicTriassic> MikeD_ : setting location = 'thenewpage'? isn't that just for the window object or an iframe? I just want to load thenewpage into a small div. and would prefer not to have to use an iframe
[06:55:37] <Cork> JurassicTriassic: you can't really do that
[06:57:04] <JurassicTriassic> Cork: Maybe I'll have to use angular or something and use the div as a view, and load the thenewpage into that view using routing
[06:57:23] <seutje> lol
[06:57:41] <seutje> you can load content and dump it in a DIV
[06:57:49] <seutje> angular will do the same, just hide it
[06:58:04] <thaifood> that worked great. Thanks so much guys !
[06:58:19] <seutje> no thaifood, thank you for the many lovely dishes!
[06:58:34] <thaifood> lime and cilantro for everyone !
[06:59:53] <seutje> tbh, I am one of the ~15% of people who experiences cilantro like soap
[07:02:31] <JurassicTriassic> seutje: how would you approach the problem? If you had a single-page-app and wanted to use it inside a page of another project? (without using a serverside language)
[07:02:59] <seutje> require?
[07:03:00] <skullcrasher> what is the easiest way to provide plugin functions, so i can change some settings of a plugin after init?
[07:03:46] <seutje> JurassicTriassic: if it's isolated enough, you should be able to drop it in there, but it probably isn't so an iframe would be a safer option
[07:03:57] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: Depends on the plugin.
[07:04:19] <JurassicTriassic> seutje: but require would just helps to manage the dependencies, right? does it provide any system of actually loading one page into another element?
[07:04:54] <seutje> JurassicTriassic: no, just scripts
[07:05:04] <skullcrasher> BillCriswell: well for now i have a options object that is overwritte/extended, as stated in the docs
[07:05:24] <seutje> actually, it does html too
[07:05:24] <aro> is there a way to select elements that do NOT have a certain class?
[07:05:24] <skullcrasher> but now i want to have the ability to just say: set option X to value Y
[07:05:40] <seutje> aro: either :not or filter
[07:05:55] <aro> ok
[07:05:58] <seutje> $(':not(".foo")")
[07:06:00] <skullcrasher> like $().plugin.setOption(value)
[07:06:04] <seutje> but do note the perf impact!
[07:06:56] <ProducedRaw> hi
[07:08:11] <ProducedRaw> I'm working with a legacy codebase where jquery is accessible as $J instead of $. I want to use this plugin - http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/ but it expects $ to point to jQuery. How can I resolve this issue?
[07:08:39] <aro> how do i select all elements that match class A and class B
[07:09:12] <BillCriswell> aro: $('.classA.classB')
[07:09:28] <BillCriswell> If you want class="classA classB"
[07:09:37] <dman777_alter> hi, does anyone use datepicker from jquerui? in $( ".selector" ).datepicker({ dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd" }) I can not understand why they used a object {}
[07:09:50] <BillCriswell> if you want class="classA" and class="classB" you would do $('.classA, .classB')
[07:10:56] <Cork> dman777_alter: it is so you can have more then just one option
[07:11:01] <shoky> dman777_alter: that's how you initialize it
[07:11:11] <Cork> dman777_alter: and the format is how all jquery ui initializes
[07:12:50] <dman777_alter> Cork: oh...ok. thanks. would setDate: "10/12/2012" be the option to use to set the default dates?
[07:15:16] <Cork> dman777_alter: setDate is a function i don't think it is accepted in the initializer
[07:21:17] <dman777_alter> How can I use 2 seperate setDate( date )....one for the 'from' input box and one for the 'to' input box?
[07:22:12] <aro> BillCriswell: how would i build that list dynamically?
[07:22:27] <aro> we want to filter on certain classes if checkboxes are checked
[07:23:18] <BillCriswell> aro: You could get the values of the checked checkboxes into an array and use checkedValues.join(', ') or something like that.
[07:23:27] <BillCriswell> aro: Did you want .foo.bar or .foo, .bar ?
[07:23:29] <aro> ah ok
[07:23:37] <aro> .foo,.bar
[07:24:23] <BillCriswell> ok then yeah, something like ['.type1', '.type2'].join(', ')
[07:24:55] <Bauer> Cork: any idea why the moment I set attr("src", url) on an IFRAME, it takes over the whole DOM, removing the parent frame as well? as if I did a window.location...
[07:24:55] <aro> ok
[07:26:29] <BillCriswell> aro: You could use .map to get the values into an array.
[07:27:06] <aro> can i do this:                     filters.push(':not(.has_collection)');
[07:27:13] <aro> and then filter on those?
[07:27:32] <aro> like filter( :not(.has_collection), :not('.etc'))
[07:32:52] <BillCriswell> aro: :not(.foo,.bar) should work.
[07:35:13] <aro> ok
[07:36:49] <aro> how do i remove an element from an array?
[07:37:15] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys, I have page full of radio buttons, I was just wondering if there is a way to get the number of radio buttons and the number that has been filled
[07:38:46] <NoiseEee> sure
[07:38:50] <NoiseEee> there is a way
[07:39:05] <NoiseEee> so, how might you think we could get a count of the total buttons on the pagE?
[07:39:52] <BillCriswell> aro: .splice can work.
[07:41:19] <BillCriswell> aro: http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/1/edit here is a very hasty demo of what i think you want.
[07:42:05] <rahuldroy> I meant the count of the radio groups
[07:42:43] <rahuldroy> it is a questionaire that basically tells you the how many you have filled and how many you have remaining
[07:42:43] <NoiseEee> rahuldroy: by 'radio groups' do you mean radio buttons sharing the same name?
[07:43:11] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, The radio groups share the name name
[07:44:03] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, $(input[type=radio]).legnth returns all the options which I don't want
[07:44:09] <NoiseEee> rahuldroy: so the first thing to do would be get all the radio inputs on the page, then maybe query each one for the name and put it in a collection of sorts.
[07:44:15] <NoiseEee> don't call length right awway
[07:44:34] <NoiseEee> myCollection.inputName:[el1,el2,el3]
[07:44:48] <NoiseEee> myCollection.anotherInputName:[el1,el2,el3]
[07:45:19] <NoiseEee> maybe at the same time note if any are 'checked'
[07:45:27] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, oooo that kinda looks ugly
[07:45:47] <NoiseEee> well what you want isn't a one liner, sorry
[07:46:27] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, its going to be a function anyways
[07:46:48] <NoiseEee> go for it
[07:46:49] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, but I want to make ti as generic as possible because this is a multip page form
[07:47:32] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, listing names in a collection might not be a good way to go about it.
[07:47:56] <NoiseEee> except that you deliberately asked about identifying inputs with the same name i guess
[07:48:18] <NoiseEee> there's no way to magically group them together without querying them first
[07:48:29] <NoiseEee> if you *know* the names beforehand then sure
[07:50:44] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, I do know all the names of the element
[07:52:00] <NoiseEee> so then $('input[name="theName"]')
[07:53:22] <rahuldroy> maybe I could write a simple jquery each loop
[07:55:45] <xec> rahuldroy: http://jsfiddle.net/9hGea/
[07:56:05] <xec> rahuldroy: assuming you don't know the names or how many groups or how many in each group
[07:56:17] <xec> rahuldroy: if you do know, it can be simplified
[07:56:37] <rahuldroy> xec, that is exactly what I wanted :)
[07:57:53] <rahuldroy> NoiseEee, Thanks for all your help :)
[07:58:02] <NoiseEee> yep np
[07:58:08] <rahuldroy> xec, Thanks for the solution as well :)
[07:58:20] <BillCriswell> aro: Did you get the link I showed you?
[07:59:36] <fRAiLtY-> If I’m doing $.get(‘/search’) which has (in php) return json_decode($var) then that should show in console right? i.e. console.log($.get(‘/search’)); should show the response?
[07:59:50] <BillCriswell> fRAiLtY-: No.
[08:00:18] <BillCriswell> $.get('/search').done(function(result){ console.log(result); }); is what you're shooting for I think.
[08:00:23] <xec> rahuldroy: fixed a couple minor issues http://jsfiddle.net/9hGea/1/
[08:00:49] <xec> (the initial text isn't hardcoded)
[08:00:53] <BillCriswell> fRAiLtY-: Also think you want json_encode(), decode would take a js string and make it into a php data... thingie.
[08:01:00] <BillCriswell> I'm terrible with technical terms.
[08:01:10] <BillCriswell> would take a json string*
[08:01:21] <fRAiLtY-> Sry, meant encode
[08:01:33] <BillCriswell> Ah ok!
[08:02:00] <rahuldroy> xec, I  noticed that and I had already fixed that ;)
[08:02:30] <xec> fRAiLtY-: still, the data won't be returned from $.get() -- it will be supplied to the .done() callback
[08:02:45] <fRAiLtY-> Gotcha, think it’s my PHP that’s gay
[08:02:45] <rahuldroy> xec, what is .first().chage() bit do??
[08:03:27] <xec> rahuldroy: .first() gets the first radio button, then .change() triggers the change event so the event fires once at load (and sets the initial text)
[08:04:00] <xec> fRAiLtY-: $.get("/search").done(function(dataFromPhpServer){ console.log(dataFromPhpServer); });
[08:04:25] <fRAiLtY-> Ok works now cheers
[08:04:32] <fRAiLtY-> My php was broken anyway :)
[08:04:48] <xec> sorry i now see BillCriswell said the same thing already :)
[08:05:34] <rahuldroy> xec, as this code will be in a function, I was just thinking of doing it this way $('#form :input').on('change', function () { CalcFormProgress(); });
[08:05:57] <jphase> :input?
[08:06:06] <xec> rahuldroy sure, but you could also just do .change(CalcFormProgress)
[08:06:49] <rahuldroy> jphase, that is just selecting all the input tags in the form
[08:06:53] <BillCriswell> fRAiLtY-: haha.
[08:07:14] <jphase> rahuldroy: $('#form input')
[08:07:14] <rahuldroy> xec, got a couple more functions
[08:07:33] <xec> rahuldroy: but i agree, a separate function for the handler is better, then you can just call that instead of firing the change (which might have side effects)
[08:07:35] <rahuldroy> jphase, hmmm
[08:08:10] <xec> jphase: ":input" is a jquery selector for all inputs (including <select> and <textarea>)
[08:08:26] <jphase> oic
[08:08:38] <jphase> thought he just literally meant all "input" tags
[08:08:48] <xec> that said, i think rahuldroy might want 'input[type="radio"]' instead
[08:09:10] <xec> preferably with a form container like you suggested
[08:09:30] <rahuldroy> xec, I have updated the code to select all input already.
[08:09:49] <rahuldroy> xec, the particular form I was testing it only had radio buttons
[08:10:11] <xec> i see :)
[08:10:21] <rahuldroy> xec, other pages in this program has other elements
[08:11:01] <rahuldroy> I will learn js properly one day...
[08:11:30] <xec> input[type="radio"] is a css selector ;)
[08:13:09] <rahuldroy> xec, grrrrr, I thought it picked the dom element
[08:13:25] <rahuldroy> xec, I am banging my head right now
[08:13:27] <xec> it does?
[08:13:32] <xec> what do you mean
[08:14:09] <rahuldroy> xec, what did mean by it is a css selector
[08:14:44] <xec> the syntax for selecting elements with jquery is the same as css. i'm just saying learning css too is a good idea
[08:15:58] <rahuldroy> xec, makes sense now
[08:16:22] <rahuldroy> xec, worst thing about web is that to make a program, you need to know like 5 languages :(
[08:18:00] <xec> yeah i know what you mean
[08:32:05] <aro> BillCriswell are you still here
[08:32:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:32:47] <aro> i am doing what you said, sticking the elements in an array, but for some reason they arent staying in the array until a second element is added?
[08:32:57] <aro> let me see if i can fiddle it
[08:33:15] <BillCriswell> aro: I set up a fiddle for you.
[08:33:19] <BillCriswell> aro: http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/1/edit
[08:37:14] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/r6xLU/1/
[08:37:40] <BillCriswell> aro: Way over complicating it with this.
[08:37:47] <aro> really?
[08:38:13] <BillCriswell> Yes. Did you see what I gave you?
[08:38:15] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/1/edit
[08:38:17] <aro> looking now
[08:47:50] <aro> its still behaving the same way
[08:52:57] <aro> ok i think it is performing right, but it isnt exactly what i need
[08:53:30] <aro> If an element has class1 and class2, and we select class1 and class2 from checklboxes, it should remain visible
[08:53:38] <aro> but should disappear when we select class3 from checkbox
[08:53:42] <aro> does that make sense
[08:53:49] <duch_kazatel> is there a fiddle kicking around?
[08:54:07] <aro> http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/1/edit
[08:54:28] <BillCriswell> aro: So you want .foo.bar instead of .foo, .bar
[08:54:36] <BillCriswell> The opposite of what was said earlier.
[08:54:39] <aro> Yeah - I was mistaken
[08:54:45] <aro> I was thinking on a different track
[08:55:26] <BillCriswell> aro: http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/3/edit?html,js,output should do the trick ( I didn't edit any HTML, though, so nothing will match after the first check ).
[08:55:44] <BillCriswell> My new shoes are making fart noises. =(
[08:55:56] <brunoais> BillCriswell, that sounds musical
[08:57:10] <aro> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .
[08:57:37] <BillCriswell> aro: YEah, meant just values.join('.')
[08:57:45] <BillCriswell> aro: Blah, values.join('');
[08:57:49] <aro> ok
[08:57:52] <BillCriswell> forgot the . were in the data attribute.
[08:58:25] <aro> now it does this: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ..has_videos
[08:58:56] <BillCriswell> aro: http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/4/edit?html,js,output
[08:59:23] <aro> ok hang on
[09:00:35] <heythere> hey guys
[09:00:46] <heythere> trying to do something like that http://jsfiddle.net/tN8Rx/ but hmm need a bit of help
[09:01:32] <heythere> I want to do an ajaxrequest get the json and pass it on a csv as soon as i click the button download that csv http://jsfiddle.net/tN8Rx/1/ example
[09:08:26] <subbero> Hi
[09:08:39] <heythere> hi
[09:08:39] <heythere> !
[09:08:40] <heythere> !
[09:08:41] <heythere> 11
[09:09:01] <subbero> I have a problem with fancybox. I use it with linked images (<a><img...) and have the problem that i wish to close fancybox only, not to go to the link
[09:09:27] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys another question :s. How to check if a target element is visible. I have found :visible but that only seems to apply at elements with the display css property. The element might not be visible because it is hidded by a parent element
[09:09:31] <heythere> no idea what fancybox is
[09:09:39] <subbero> The problem is content = current.tpl.image.replace('{href}', href);
[09:09:40] <subbero> content = current.tpl.image.replace('{href}', href);
[09:09:44] <subbero> Ups
[09:09:44] <tw2113> modal popup/lightbox heythere
[09:09:58] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: You'd have to check if all the parent's are visible.
[09:10:42] <subbero> Ok, should post the question on fancybox github
[09:10:45] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: Do you know which parent is likely to be set to hidden?
[09:11:19] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell, kinda but I like to make it as generic as possible
[09:11:44] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: That'll get very inefficient.
[09:13:06] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell, so you reckon just use .parent()..
[09:15:10] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: .parents() with an s.
[09:15:58] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: http://jsbin.com/zekavumo/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:16:10] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/zekavumo/2/edit
[09:16:43] <aro> im back
[09:16:51] <aro> its not hiding the other elements
[09:17:08] <heythere> noone to help a brother out  http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/42-the-answer-to-life-the-universe-and-everything-2205734.html
[09:17:12] <heythere> learn that !
[09:17:14] <naeluh_cork> you its wed !
[09:17:24] <naeluh_cork> heythere: heythere
[09:17:32] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_cork wuddup duder
[09:17:47] <rahuldroy> BillCriswell, I see what you did there. I was going to do .parent().parent() which looks very stupid :P
[09:17:48] <naeluh_wed> duch_kazatel: not much !
[09:18:08] <naeluh_wed> look forward to memorial day weekend haha!
[09:18:11] <duch_kazatel> nice
[09:18:13] <naeluh_wed> looking*
[09:18:15] <BillCriswell> rahuldroy: haha.
[09:20:01] <MrDeveloper> Guys...I have a serious problem with JQuery.
[09:20:14] <Sergonium> ok
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[09:21:22] <NoiseEee> seek recovery
[09:21:32] <naeluh_wed> it could be terminal
[09:21:35] <MrDeveloper> i wrote a simple image slider script and it works great but...when image starts to fade out it takes in the elements above it
[09:21:56] <duch_kazatel> well there's your problem - don't write "image sliders" (you mean carousel, right?)
[09:22:03] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ MrDeveloper
[09:22:03] <b-ot> MrDeveloper: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:22:35] <BillCriswell> People love writing image sliders.
[09:22:49] <duch_kazatel> i wrote a marquee tag replacement once.
[09:23:06] <naeluh_wed> slider shows
[09:23:19] <duch_kazatel> that was a much more fun exercize.
[09:23:25] <BillCriswell> I bet the whole internet thanks you for that duch_kazatel.
[09:23:26] <Sergonium> i wrote a poem once. it sucked
[09:24:00] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell what's sad is we all actually liked it in use, but agreed that it looked a little hokey and killed it.
[09:24:19] <MrDeveloper> Can I use pastebin?
[09:24:21] <Sergonium> anyway, you sure you are not selecting some higher class/id/element in your slider script MrDeveloper
[09:24:22] <duch_kazatel> i might plugin-ify it and put it out on the webs.
[09:24:25] <duch_kazatel> MrDeveloper please don't.
[09:24:32] <MrDeveloper> T.T
[09:24:34] <duch_kazatel> MrDeveloper please use one of the three services suggested.
[09:24:39] <duch_kazatel> pastebin's pretty bad.
[09:25:03] <aro>         $items.not(values.join('')).hide(); doesnt seem to be working
[09:25:05] <naeluh_wed> whoa this pretty cool https://github.com/asciimoo/drawille
[09:25:24] <duch_kazatel> aro sorry did you make a fiddle earlier?
[09:25:27] <MrDeveloper> http://fixee.org/paste/xw4b1v7/
[09:25:41] <aro> http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/3/edit
[09:26:04] <BillCriswell> aro: I sent you an updated one.
[09:26:09] <BillCriswell> A while ago.
[09:26:09] <aro> oh
[09:26:12] <duch_kazatel> MrDeveloper :( your formatting - http://fixee.org/paste/xw4b1v7/#url=ehxfg9n
[09:26:20] <MrDeveloper> I know. :D
[09:26:33] <BillCriswell> aro: http://jsbin.com/fuwukomo/4/edit this is working
[09:26:38] <aro> oh yeah, thats the one i am using
[09:26:39] <duch_kazatel> $(function() { - why are you doing this on line 81?
[09:26:44] <MrDeveloper> I'm OCD about it.
[09:27:08] <duch_kazatel> MrDeveloper also you're using setInterval when dealing with animations.  use .delay() instead.
[09:27:17] <duch_kazatel> and cache some selectors.
[09:27:30] <aro> doof
[09:27:35] <MrDeveloper> to synchronize animations @duch_kazatel
[09:27:43] <BillCriswell> aro: .show() vs .hide() got ya, huh?
[09:28:21] <duch_kazatel> improved formatting: http://fixee.org/paste/xw4b1v7/#6507=&url=xxw4t8g
[09:28:21] <aro> no
[09:28:27] <aro> im not that bad
[09:28:43] <BillCriswell> aro: haha. It got me for a second when I was creating it. =(
[09:28:48] <MrDeveloper> ok, but do you know why is it making my header fade out whenever the image fades?
[09:28:50] <aro> welp
[09:28:52] <aro> i am that bad
[09:28:58] <aro> yes ytou are right
[09:28:59] <duch_kazatel> MrDeveloper could you make a functioning example?
[09:29:03] <aro> :(
[09:29:38] <BillCriswell> aro: haha
[09:31:47] <MrDeveloper> There's really not much to it.
[09:32:03] <duch_kazatel> oh okay.  good luck!
[09:32:08] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:32:47] <duch_kazatel> (we usually ask people to do that partially because it sometimes helps you figure out what the problem is on your own)
[09:32:52] <duch_kazatel> rubber duck problem solving and all that.
[09:34:30] <BillCriswell> I like it just for the isolation.
[09:35:19] <duch_kazatel> That too.  Also, the extra document readies inside of switchSlidesBackward() and switchSlidesForward() - what are those for?
[09:35:34] <aro> what on earth am i doing wrong
[09:36:19] <MrDeveloper> it's for text in the container bellow the slider
[09:36:34] <duch_kazatel> MrDeveloper right, but you're using document readies in there complete unnecessarily.
[09:36:38] <duch_kazatel> you're all ready in a doc ready.
[09:36:57] <duch_kazatel> and the function scope is unnecessary since you're all ready in a function.
[09:39:16] <MrDeveloper> aaaah, to hell with this...can you recommend me some good open source image slider?
[09:39:28] <BillCriswell> That a boy.
[09:39:32] <duch_kazatel> there are tons out there.  bxslider is one.
[09:39:44] <duch_kazatel> or don't use one at all - http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[09:39:47] <MrDeveloper> agpl license
[09:40:06] <duch_kazatel> and again, you want a carousel, not a "slider".  a slider is a control for ranged inputs.
[09:40:30] <MrDeveloper> right
[09:40:34] <BillCriswell> No one ever came across a slider and said "I like to use this", someone came across it and said "This looks nice" and that's where things went to shit.
[09:40:53] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell woah.  that's... well put.
[09:42:01] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I read a similar thing recently about clients looking at websites instead of using them and that's my grand conclusion to damn near everything.
[09:43:01] <duch_kazatel> i do not envy you there - sometimes i wish i worked at a design/dev firm, then i remember i'd have to put up with that stuff wayyy more than i do now.
[09:43:12] <duch_kazatel> do you get a lot of bad requests like that?
[09:43:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It gets annoying. People are more worried about retina images than something that works.
[09:43:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Not so much here. My manager usually stops that shit real quick haha.
[09:43:52] <duch_kazatel> good.
[09:47:18] <naeluh_wed> BillCriswell: I like that they have fake buttons for the carousel who ever made that site really hates carousels haha
[09:47:37] <BillCriswell> naeluh_wed: The "shouldiuseacarousel" site?
[09:47:42] <naeluh_wed> yeah
[09:48:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I think that's designed to bring out the worst in them.
[09:48:08] <naeluh_wed> I mean they really haaattee them
[09:48:16] <Jattenalle> use carousel to display imoprant information, visitors love it! [insert insane wolf image here]
[09:48:31] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_wed there's a lot of stuff out there now on the subject - tons of studies show that users basically ignore the,
[09:48:33] <duch_kazatel> *them
[09:48:43] <duch_kazatel> "banner blindness"
[09:49:25] <duch_kazatel> http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/ - this is a good one.
[09:49:55] <BillCriswell> http://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/ as well
[09:49:57] <aro> bill
[09:50:09] <naeluh_wed> yeah for sure its really funny cause my one friend who fancies himself a ux designer but rarely makes anythign that original in the first place uses them all the time and he is the exact person that this is aimed towards I feel cause thats like his go to move and its entirely ineffective haha I can't to show him but he prob wont get it
[09:50:13] <aro> why is it that when i do a console.log() on my $items object insidew that function -t heres nothing in it?
[09:50:17] <aro> its not a jquery object
[09:50:28] <BillCriswell> aro: You'd have to show me the code.
[09:50:56] <Jattenalle> naeluh_wed, it's really become one of those "I have no idea what i'm doing.. carousel!" moves.. reminds me of 1996 when every website would use table layouts, for everything.
[09:50:57] <naeluh_wed> duch_kazatel: I am going to read thanks !
[09:50:59] <aro> http://jsbin.com/rifahuva/1/
[09:51:03] <BillCriswell> http://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-complex-content/ has been one of my favorites recently. I really have no idea why anyone would ever use an accordion.
[09:51:06] <Jattenalle> also spinningskull.gif
[09:51:28] <naeluh_wed> whoa tables were popular at one point as popular as they are now in email html ?
[09:51:42] <aro> <td>css sucks</td>
[09:51:53] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_wed they're just another iteration of the horizontal scroll bar on websites imo.  they CAN be useful - sometimes - if you're using them appropriately.
[09:52:07] <BillCriswell> aro: The HTML Would also help cause the JS seems ok.
[09:52:07] <duch_kazatel> but people apply them to the wrong cases all the time.
[09:52:13] <aro> they are good for tabular data
[09:52:15] <aro> ok
[09:52:21] <duch_kazatel> naeluh_wed lol
[09:52:31] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, i used accordion for my UI, currently moving away frmo it though.. just not flexible enough http://i.imgur.com/qagqmnN.png
[09:52:44] <villor> I am trying to append images to my DOM using jquery .append on a div, but the images won't load in IE8, is there a workaround for this?
[09:52:53] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ villor
[09:52:53] <b-ot> villor: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:53:08] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Haha good stuff. I just don't get it.
[09:53:38] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, it was easy, and it "worked".. but yeah it's not a good solution, hence moving away from it.. it locks the UI into a specific path, and makes things annoying to use
[09:53:39] <aro> when i debug $items, i get this
[09:53:39] <aro> [prevObject: b.fn.b.init[1], context: document, selector: ".filter-element", jquery: "1.9.1", constructor: function…]
[09:54:25] <naeluh_wed> whoa this awesome people are really doing some good testing with this shit I love those heat maps haha !
[09:55:20] <villor> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/YwCj2/
[09:55:46] <aro> BillCriswell: moving the $items      = $('.filter-element') inside the event function fixed it
[09:56:17] <duch_kazatel> villor ahahaha jsfiddle doesn't work in IE.  one sec.
[09:56:37] <naeluh_wed> duch_kazatel: what are you using ie for ?
[09:56:47] <duch_kazatel> err, IE8.
[09:57:06] <duch_kazatel> and naeluh_wed look up - villor's code doesn't work in IE8.  should be fine.
[09:58:01] <naeluh_wed> oh shit yeah I see
[10:01:32] <duch_kazatel> villor still poking. might have something in a sec.
[10:01:45] <duch_kazatel> yep.  easy.
[10:02:06] <villor> well it seems the jsfiddle i just linked actually works in ie(not the actual jsfiddle, but the same code in it's own .html file)
[10:02:10] <villor> http://jsfiddle.net/YwCj2/2/
[10:02:15] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/YwCj2/3/
[10:02:17] <villor> here's the one which does not work
[10:02:19] <duch_kazatel> try this.
[10:03:06] <duch_kazatel> villor look at what I just posted - that fixes the IE8 issue.
[10:03:14] <duch_kazatel> you ran into an old ie quirk.
[10:03:34] <villor> it works perfectly, thanks!
[10:03:37] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[10:03:55] <villor> I wish everyone would just stop using old browsers... it would make life so much easier
[10:04:10] <duch_kazatel> we're getting there.  slowly.
[10:05:12] <villor> hmm nvm, for some reason I was back in Edge mode, it still does not work in IE8
[10:05:13] <BillCriswell> aro: Cool.
[10:05:25] <duch_kazatel> villor you sure?
[10:05:39] <duch_kazatel> villor because my fix worked for me in IE8.
[10:06:03] <villor> yeah, here's the exact code I'm using
[10:06:04] <villor> http://jsbin.com/kamisucu/1/
[10:06:20] <duch_kazatel> woaaaahhhh...
[10:07:02] <naeluh_wed> roll the dice
[10:07:03] <duch_kazatel> o.o that formatting.
[10:07:32] <naeluh_wed> tidyup ?
[10:07:52] <duch_kazatel> plus some.
[10:08:29] <villor> why the hell do they spin like that?
[10:08:39] <duch_kazatel> nothing in there is working for me villor
[10:08:40] <villor> that only happened in jsbin
[10:09:24] <villor> http://pastie.org/9196549
[10:10:42] <duch_kazatel> villor put a console log after that click to make sure that's actually running.
[10:10:44] <villor> ohh... jsbin had other tabs with crazy default values
[10:13:16] <villor> the click didn't register..
[10:13:21] <aro> are there instances where li:visible might not work correctly?
[10:13:22] <duch_kazatel> right.
[10:15:07] <aro> it seems that fadeOut has a serious delay at the end to where it marks it as invisible
[10:16:29] <duch_kazatel> villor because body doesn't have any contents.  http://jsfiddle.net/g4X2M/
[10:16:36] <duch_kazatel> you need to have a clickable area.
[10:16:57] <duch_kazatel> you could also register against $(document), but that's hacky.
[10:17:08] <villor> yeah I see.. this one now works properly in IE8
[10:17:44] <villor> but the actual site I am working on does not, but it is too much and too private to paste, so I'll try to reproduce it outside of the project
[10:18:05] <duch_kazatel> we don't want to see the whole thing anyway ;)
[10:20:05] <villor> that zoom thing will probably fix it though :)
[10:20:11] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[10:20:14] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:26:40] <crash1hd> anyone advise a better way to do this if( $(this).children().is("input") || $(this).children().children().is("input") || $(this).children().children().children().is("input") ){ other then that?
[10:26:55] <duch_kazatel> .find()
[10:26:57] <crash1hd> basically if any child of $(this) is an input I want it to return true
[10:27:18] <duch_kazatel> if ($this.find('input').length)
[10:34:22] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: You can also use .has('input')
[10:34:35] <BillCriswell> Which probably runs damn near what duch_kazatel said.
[10:34:50] <crash1hd> Yeah I tried that one but it returns true even when there is no input
[10:35:04] <naeluh_wed> yo!
[10:35:05] <duch_kazatel> !paste
[10:35:05] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:35:16] <duch_kazatel> crash1hd ^
[10:35:16] <naeluh_wed> and were back !
[10:35:22] <crash1hd> or would that be .has('input').length
[10:35:24] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: Ah, that makes sense.
[10:35:30] <BillCriswell> crash1hd: Yeah, would need that.
[10:35:41] <crash1hd> I bet thats what I was missing lol :) thanks
[10:35:50] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:39:47] <Cork> BillCriswell: little note $(this).has("input") returns this if there is a child of type input
[10:40:03] <Cork> while $(this).find("input") returns the input
[10:40:10] <Cork> so there is a difference between the two
[10:40:15] <duch_kazatel> good to know.
[10:40:22] <duch_kazatel> i always forget about stuff like .find()
[10:42:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: Wouldn't has('input') essential be .filter( this.find(input) )
[10:42:48] <Cork> BillCriswell: no
[10:43:09] <Cork> or hmm
[10:43:16] <decx> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/b39ee05b69336d5a6230287ab8bd48c48e5b206f/src/traversing.js#L48
[10:43:27] <Cork> if you have psudo coded it it could be
[10:44:05] <Cork> BillCriswell: it would be the same as this $(this).filter(function() { return $(this).find('input').length > 0 });
[10:44:20] <BillCriswell> Yeah that's what I was saying basically.
[10:44:26] <Cork> thought so
[10:44:39] <BillCriswell> It's like a lazy filter to do a find.length whatever
[10:45:01] <Cork> thought $(this).filter($(this).find(input)) is actually valid :)
[10:45:05] <Cork> *though
[10:45:37] <BillCriswell> Cork: Never thought to use a jQuery collection in a filter.
[10:46:13] <BillCriswell> That feels weird to me haha
[10:46:18] <BillCriswell> Well, in this situation.
[10:47:10] <Cork> $('selector').filter(event.target) is used in jquery delegated if i remember correctly
[10:47:48] <d0de> given a range of values like {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} is there a math operation I can perform that will convert them into something more like a hyperbolic curve, like {0, 0.5, 1.25, 2.75, 4} (or something similar) ?
[10:48:21] <d0de> basically, start and end in the same place but have smaller steps at the bottom and bigger steps at the top
[10:48:48] <BillCriswell> Here goes where me knowing math would be awesome.
[10:49:15] <Cork> d0de: well there are many formulas to build a curve between a start and max
[10:49:34] <Cork> i wrote a bunch of them for slider values a few years back
[10:50:01] <d0de> Cork, I actually explained it poorly, ideally this operation could be performed on individual values
[10:50:04] <duch_kazatel> Cork hah i worked on a slider project that used them a while ago.  painful.
[10:50:32] <d0de> it's for something tied to a slider, but for some of the functions linear values work best, and for other functions exponential values would give better results
[10:50:34] <Cork> duch_kazatel: it was actually one of the most fun parts of the project :)
[10:51:14] <d0de> if the problem is non trivial I might just forget it, it's not that important
[10:51:23] <duch_kazatel> i wasn't a fan because the data that was driving the standard deviations and mean/avg/etc were removed, so I had to figure out how to replicate it.
[10:51:38] <duch_kazatel> wound up telling our dudes to put it back because there was no way i could handle it otherwise.
[10:51:44] <Cork> d0de: i've found fibonacci to work well for slider values
[10:53:28] <Cork> but there are a lot of curves you can build in math
[10:53:39] <Cork> it all comes down to how you want the curve to look
[10:54:13] <BillCriswell> Been using duckduckgo the last few days. It's doing a good job so far.
[10:54:24] <d0de> Cork, fair enough, I'll have a look around, thanks
[10:54:29] <Cork> BillCriswell: i've been moving more and more there too
[10:54:52] <BillCriswell> Cork: I've tried it on and off for years now but it's feeling really good now.
[10:54:54] <Cork> BillCriswell: i've actually had problem getting good results from google, and ddg has given me better results for code searches
[10:55:00] <Cork> ya
[10:55:15] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah, I love the little code snippets for common functions at the top.
[10:55:37] <BillCriswell> When they get it right it's awesome.
[10:55:49] <Cork> BillCriswell: checked the new version btw?
[10:56:07] <Cork> https://duckduckgo.com/next
[10:56:17] <Cork> opps wrong
[10:56:31] <Cork> https://duckduckgo.com/
[10:56:34] <Cork> BAH
[10:56:40] <BillCriswell> You're a pro at this Cork.
[10:56:41] <Cork> stupid copy paste...
[10:56:52] <Cork> https://next.duckduckgo.com/
[10:56:59] <Cork> oh, not i see why
[10:57:04] <Cork> it has gone live :)
[10:57:05] <duch_kazatel> goddammit safari you you fucking behave?!
[10:57:07] <Cork> so it is the normal version
[10:57:19] <Cork> *now i see
[10:57:24] <BillCriswell> Yeah, think I have been using it.
[10:57:26] <BillCriswell> Feels good.
[10:58:00] <Cork> i like that is offers some good help in page
[10:58:03] <BillCriswell> I'd love to know what would happen if Google experiment with infinite scroll. I bet having a "first page" makes them a fuck ton of money.
[10:58:37] <Cork> BillCriswell: and other
[10:58:49] <d0de> f(x) = (Math.pow(Math.E, x) - 1) / (Math.E -1) // seems to work pretty well
[10:58:59] <Cork> there are companies where there only businessmen is first page on google
[10:59:24] * Cork nods
[10:59:39] <BillCriswell> I bet infinite scroll would make some small businesses very happy.
[11:00:38] <Cork> BillCriswell: dhtml ftw! ;)
[11:01:10] <BillCriswell> I had a M$ book on DHTML years and years ago. I learned so much from it.
[11:01:35] <Cork> wonder how many web developers today even know what that is :)
[11:02:09] <krambiorix> hi, this date should validate... What am i doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/yn34P/
[11:02:32] <BillCriswell> I should put DHTML on m resume.
[11:02:33] <duch_kazatel> DHTML?
[11:04:11] <Cork> krambiorix: your test is inverted
[11:04:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yes.
[11:05:04] <krambiorix> aaaaai Cork  thanks!
[11:05:06] <Cork> you test if it is Invalid or NaN, and if it ISN'T then you alert "error"
[11:06:12] <Cork> ugg it's tough typing with an ice-cream in one hand
[11:06:59] <BillCriswell> Cork: Rough life.
[11:07:05] <Cork> :)
[11:07:53] <minionion> @Cork I have that issue every day about 3:30 when I grab an otterpop from the office fridge
[11:08:42] <d0de> I'm math impaired. For the function { f(x) = (e^x - 1) / (e - 1) } is there something I can adjust to make the curve steeper or shallower?
[11:09:03] <d0de> Other than just running it n times, which seems wasteful :P
[11:09:48] <naeluh_wed> hey is there a way to check if a background image is present in a div ?
[11:10:33] <Cork> naeluh_wed: .css('background-image') == 'none'; ?
[11:10:47] <Cork> (not sure if that works haven't ever tried
[11:10:50] <Cork> )
[11:11:04] <naeluh_wed> looks good to me
[11:11:15] <d0de> it works
[11:11:25] <naeluh_wed> Cork: your awesome I am not sure why i didnt think of that
[11:11:34] <naeluh_wed> such logic much awesome
[11:12:10] <BillCriswell> Seems to be about right based on my brief testing.
[11:12:24] <BillCriswell> Wonder what would happeh with gradients and shit.
[11:13:11] <BillCriswell> Might need to check for index of 'url(' or something?
[11:15:16] <Cork> BillCriswell: well gradient is basically a background image too, just computer generated
[11:15:50] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yes. A background-color could fall into the same argument as well?
[11:16:01] <MikeD_> d0de: are you trying to draw with math functions?
[11:16:03] <Cork> BillCriswell: no that is a solid
[11:16:15] <Cork> BillCriswell: basically color is done with fill in the browser
[11:16:26] <Cork> while gradients and images is, well images :)
[11:16:34] <MikeD_> i would argue that gradient is closer to background color than image
[11:16:54] <Cork> MikeD_: i was talking about how it is handled/works in the browser
[11:16:56] <MikeD_> mostly because images require extra requests to get
[11:17:03] <BillCriswell> I think MikeD_ and I are on the same page. You can use the gradients to make something look like an image though as well.
[11:17:07] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I have a json array and on my page i am listing these objects  within- each within its own container.  When they are listed the containers are closed (only displays the summary).  I have implemented a way of clicking the container so that it expands and makes a separate query to a different json object to display a body field.  This works fine. I am using $(this) which should only affect the
[11:17:07] <CocoStorm> current container being clicked right?  The problem is implementing the close button.  Instead of making another query to display the summary again I have two divs which are either display:none; or display:block; It almost works except sometimes the containers disappear and sometimes the other containers close instead.  Not sure what is happening.. can anyone help?
[11:17:29] <Cork> CocoStorm: wow... you seriously expect someone to read that??
[11:17:55] <MikeD_> what did the channel your originally pasted it into say?
[11:18:13] <CocoStorm> MikeD_, I wrote it in notepad this is the first channel ;)
[11:18:18] <CocoStorm> Cork, oui
[11:18:33] <Cork> CocoStorm: irc != email
[11:18:36] <naeluh_wed> CocoStorm: let practice some restraint
[11:18:42] <naeluh_wed> lets*
[11:18:50] <Cork> keep it short
[11:18:51] <MrDeveloper> Please check if my formatting is ok. - http://fixee.org/paste/6l9h5gc/
[11:19:25] <MikeD_> CocoStorm: make a jsfiddle illustrating the behavior, either you'll solve your problem making a testcase or you'll have something we can understand
[11:19:54] <CocoStorm> MikeD_, it uses handlebars too though not sure if it will work?
[11:20:13] <d0de> MikeD_, no, I was just trying to take the output of a linear slider and transform the range into something closer to an exponential curve. I realize now I can just adjust n in the function { f(x) = (n^x -1) / (n - 1) } and that works fine for my needs
[11:20:28] <CocoStorm> and ajax to make the request
[11:20:34] <CocoStorm> but i'll give it a shot
[11:20:45] <BillCriswell> Cork: I was thinking conceptually. I understand your view from the browsers standpoint for sure. It really all depended on what they wanted haha.
[11:21:01] <Cork> heh this reminded me of a chat in a developer channel when one of the lead developers wrote a ~ 200 line js script and sent it to the one requestion it in the developer channel
[11:21:29] <MikeD_> BillCriswell, Cork: I was going to ask if a div in front of another div with a bg image was relevant, but i guess not in this case
[11:21:50] <BillCriswell> Yeah, we've already all way overthought this ahah.
[11:21:59] <Cork> MikeD_: relevant to what?
[11:22:19] <MikeD_> relevant to the question "how to know if there's a bg image in/behind a div"
[11:22:34] <Cork> no i think the question was in the simplest form
[11:22:46] <Cork> just checking if a background image was sat on the element
[11:22:50] <MikeD_> oh, those are too easy to spend 20 minutes answering
[11:23:58] <Cork> man i wish js had the time package from ruby
[11:24:21] <BillCriswell> I never used it.. when I'm dealing with dates a lot I use moment() though.
[11:24:24] <Cork> 5.hours.before(Date.now)
[11:24:29] <Cork> :)
[11:25:01] <Cork> or can also be written as 5.hours.ago
[11:25:06] <BillCriswell> moment().subtract(5, 'days')
[11:25:20] <BillCriswell> Er, moment().subtract('days', 5)
[11:25:24] <MikeD_> is that really a method of the literal number 5?
[11:25:39] <Cork> MikeD_: the litteral number
[11:25:41] <MrDeveloper> Nevermind, see ya later.
[11:25:49] <MikeD_> wow
[11:25:51] <BillCriswell> Everything is an object in a ruby.
[11:26:03] <Cork> MikeD_: .hours converts the number to a DateTime object
[11:26:20] <Cork> there is also .seconds, .minutes, .days, .years ...
[11:26:26] <MikeD_> still feels weird to me to write that
[11:26:41] <BillCriswell> That guy hasn't said anthing in hours and says "nevermind, see ya later".
[11:27:06] <BillCriswell> Cork: moment()  is great.
[11:27:09] <BillCriswell> small, too.
[11:27:09] <Cork> MikeD_: what makes me feel weird about ruby is that false and true is objects
[11:27:16] <Cork> and not the same object type >_<
[11:27:35] <Cork> so 0 != false
[11:27:41] <Cork> 0.to_bool == false
[11:27:44] <Cork> :/
[11:28:11] <BillCriswell> When someone really knows ruby and they write it, it looks beautiful. Anyone else and it's weird.
[11:28:17] <BillCriswell> At least in my experience.
[11:28:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: i like it and hate it at the same time
[11:28:50] <Cork> i really miss inline functions
[11:29:06] <Cork> ruby is freakingly klonky there
[11:29:31] <BillCriswell> I never actually wrote anything in it haha.
[11:29:51] <Cork> there isn't many languages i haven't developed in :)
[11:30:13] <Horacsio> it seems theres an error on line 14: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/CLfrQ/ (ReferenceError: $ is not defined) what does this mean? I got this script from here https://gist.github.com/bigfive/4256993 (with error on line16 too but I’ve fixed it)
[11:30:23] <BillCriswell> The dark Duck Duck Go theme is awesome.
[11:30:36] <Cork> Horacsio: that you haven't loade jquery
[11:30:36] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio that means that you're using $ before it exists.
[11:30:46] <Horacsio> shit!
[11:30:51] <Horacsio> I didnt?! :S
[11:31:36] <Horacsio> sorry :S
[11:31:46] <Cork> Horacsio: lol no prob
[11:31:55] <Cork> that question is easy to answer :)
[11:32:07] <naeluh_wed> can I do this ?      $('.list_calendar ul li').find('div , .day_name , h3').css({'color': '#000000'});
[11:32:31] <Cork> naeluh_wed: depends on what you expect it to do
[11:32:35] <Cork> but yes that code is valid
[11:32:42] <naeluh_wed> find all those elementrs
[11:32:49] <naeluh_wed> elements *
[11:33:02] <naeluh_wed> I will try it out
[11:33:19] <Cork> the find will look for the comma separated list inside the li yes
[11:33:53] <Cork> BillCriswell: but i have to say the two most fun languages i've used has to be js and go
[11:34:06] <Cork> BillCriswell: pascal comes as a good third
[11:34:15] <BillCriswell> Do you mess with them all through work or on your own time?
[11:34:21] <duch_kazatel> ooh pascal - there's one i haven't heard in a while.
[11:34:41] <Cork> BillCriswell: python, perl, ruby, js, php, go == work
[11:35:03] <duch_kazatel> python ++
[11:35:05] <Cork> rust, go, js, c, and a list of other == joy
[11:35:06] <Horacsio> now what would be the best viewport configs on this: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/CLfrQ/ to iphone?
[11:35:21] <BillCriswell> We're a drupal shop so PHP and JS are the only languages I touch. I've done hello works with all those languages though lol
[11:35:40] <BillCriswell> "Hello World"s
[11:35:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: i've done a lot of drupal too
[11:36:02] <Uhkis> you touch js while drupaling? :p
[11:36:07] <Cork> luckily moved on from that
[11:36:22] <Cork> i only manage one drupal site on my free time now days
[11:36:34] <BillCriswell> Cork: Yeah, can't say I'm a huge fan yet.
[11:36:52] <Horacsio> or even better: why doesnt this work: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/CLfrQ/ ???
[11:36:54] <Cork> BillCriswell: drupal is ok until you need to extend it deep in
[11:37:11] <CrowX-> ew pascal
[11:37:12] <Cork> then it suddenly becomes a spaghetti mess
[11:37:17] <Uhkis> Cork: you're clearly mixing wp and drupal
[11:37:18] <Cork> CrowX-: ew??
[11:37:18] <CrowX-> i hated that one with passion
[11:37:25] <Cork> Uhkis: no
[11:37:34] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio use .on() instead of .bind()
[11:37:39] <CrowX-> we were studying turbo pascal at high school
[11:37:44] <duch_kazatel> and make sure you're binding to the right place.
[11:37:54] <Cork> Uhkis: specifically i needed to extend the l function in drupal 5
[11:37:59] <Cork> that was NOT fun...
[11:38:06] <CrowX-> maybe it was just the bad teacher, but I hated it.
[11:38:16] <Cork> ended up having to pick the freaking menu apart to do that
[11:38:23] <Uhkis> Cork: ooh, i've only worked with D7
[11:38:25] <BillCriswell> Cork: The GUI instantly turns me off.
[11:38:34] <Horacsio> it doesnt work on landscape view :(
[11:38:34] <Cork> CrowX-: ah, i've never had a coding teacher
[11:38:49] <Uhkis> Cork: things might've been pretty horrible back then
[11:38:52] <BillCriswell> KNowing the client will be using that mess makes me nervous about their over all experience.
[11:39:02] <Cork> Uhkis: the menu problem was fixed in 6
[11:39:13] <CrowX-> well, since I started learning outside of school, programming became fun. but it was c++ :P
[11:39:27] <Cork> drupal 6 was the last version i handled to any bigger degree
[11:39:46] <CrowX-> Cork, I still dislike pascal's way of asigning variables, the := operator.
[11:39:55] <CrowX-> and the 1 indexed arrays
[11:40:27] <Cork> CrowX-: i started tinkering with bat games moved to qbasic > turbo pascal (stayed there for quite some time) > turbo c++ > tasm
[11:40:32] <CrowX-> and having to write begin/end instead of perfectly good brackets
[11:40:46] <MikeD_> "bat games" ?
[11:41:03] <CrowX-> he means batch
[11:41:07] <Uhkis> batch scripts
[11:41:08] <Cork> MikeD_: ya, i created bat files that changed the command prompt
[11:41:10] <CrowX-> windows' poor substitute of bash :p
[11:41:13] <Uhkis> text games :)
[11:41:15] <Cork> and the answers was bat files
[11:41:24] <Horacsio> because the user-scalable no, is not working! why? http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/CLfrQ/
[11:41:24] <Cork> CrowX-: pre windows
[11:41:35] <Cork> this was back in 8
[11:41:38] <Cork> *88
[11:41:46] <MikeD_> yeah, i know what .bat files are... i was wondering how you'd have the patience to make games in that environment, much less play them
[11:41:51] <CrowX-> oh, I was a baby then :P
[11:42:01] <Uhkis> MikeD_: you're not that old, are you? :)
[11:42:17] <Cork> MikeD_: bad is actually ok to code
[11:42:20] <MikeD_> oh right, back in the day time was less valuable
[11:42:26] <Cork> heh
[11:42:42] <Cork> MikeD_: also bat games was ~2-3 months
[11:42:46] <Cork> until i found qbasic :D
[11:42:55] <Uhkis> qbasic was pretty awesome at the time
[11:43:00] <MikeD_> yeah, monkeys throwing bananas was so much better
[11:43:08] <Cork> then i fiddled with it some times and the i got a copy or turbo pascal
[11:43:23] <Cork> and to this day i have to say it was the best editor i've ever used
[11:43:42] <CrowX-> Cork, you obviously haven't tried vi editor.
[11:43:51] <Cork> CrowX-: i have
[11:43:57] <CrowX-> oO
[11:44:01] <Uhkis> i prefer vim ;-)
[11:44:01] <CrowX-> and you liked pascal's more?
[11:44:06] <Cork> i used it quite often
[11:44:22] <Cork> CrowX-: specifically the build in step debugger
[11:44:30] <CrowX-> ah
[11:44:39] <Cork> but yes the theming of the editor was still better then vim is
[11:44:54] <Cork> not to mention the built in command help files :)
[11:45:22] <CrowX-> vim has a 20 minutes tutorial that makes you say "I know kung fu" at the end of it :P
[11:45:36] <Cork> heh ya
[11:45:45] <Cork> CrowX-: don't misunderstand me
[11:45:47] <Cork> i like vim
[11:46:00] <Cork> i prob like sublime text a bit more though
[11:46:06] <CrowX-> hah
[11:46:10] <Cork> but tpascal was still better :)
[11:46:29] <CrowX-> sublime text is awesome
[11:47:00] <CrowX-> and for quite some time I felt unable to decide whether to switch to sublime or not, until I found out sublime has vim mode
[11:47:16] <CrowX-> now I use sublime in vim mode for almost everything
[11:47:29] <Cork> CrowX-: not too found of the vim mode
[11:47:39] <CrowX-> but it saves time
[11:47:43] <CrowX-> and eliminates the need of mouse
[11:47:45] <Cork> it gives the overhead of vim without the power
[11:47:50] <Cork> don't really see the point
[11:48:14] <duch_kazatel> 99% of what I do in vanilla sublime doesn't require a mouse anyway.
[11:48:20] <Cork> CrowX-: sublime has a different set of helpers that match better to it
[11:48:21] <CrowX-> the ":w" and the hjkl scrolling is enough
[11:48:25] <Cork> so i prefer to use those in vim
[11:48:31] <red45923> hi all, just looking for a jquery image gallery recommendation, anyone have a favorite?
[11:48:51] <BillCriswell> red45923: image gallery is far too broad of a term. What are your needs?
[11:48:53] <CrowX-> duch_kazatel, how do you navigate through text?
[11:48:55] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ya, i don't use the mouse much either
[11:48:58] <CrowX-> in vanila sublime
[11:49:12] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- the arrow keys, ctrl+f, ctril+d, etc.
[11:49:26] <duch_kazatel> plus the home/end/pgup/pgdown.
[11:49:29] <Cork> and ctrl+page up/down
[11:49:39] <Cork> and search :)
[11:49:40] <red45923> BillCriswell, i was looking at the one at www.jssor.com, but it might be a bit more than i need
[11:49:49] <duch_kazatel> plus ctrl+left and ctrl+right are cool too.
[11:49:51] <duch_kazatel> aaan dlunch.
[11:49:55] <Horacsio> why the user-scalable=no, is not working? http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/CLfrQ/
[11:50:09] <CrowX-> arrow keys are far far away :P. hjkl is much closer
[11:50:18] <red45923> just something that can display thumbs, full size, maybe a lightbox or slider, nothing too fancy
[11:50:30] <BillCriswell> red45923: You might have better luck looking for a "carousel" or an "image slider"
[11:50:31] <duch_lunch> not when you used to do employment ad transcription ;)
[11:50:33] <duch_lunch> bbiab
[11:50:36] <Cork> CrowX-: the arrow keys is just beside the enter key
[11:50:42] <Cork> not really that far away
[11:51:36] <Cork> CrowX-: my biggest problem with vim (gvim to be precise) is that there is no way to get a decent project/folder sidebar
[11:52:00] <CrowX-> oh, I hated those
[11:52:02] <red45923> sure BillCriswell that sounds right, anyone have a recommended JQ carousel/imageslider one they have used?
[11:52:07] <Cork> and that is prob the main reason i like sublime text
[11:52:28] <CrowX-> I started programming in ms visual studio, later turned to eclipse, and I never used the project/folder sidebar. it was waste of screen space
[11:52:31] <Cork> CrowX-: if you ever develop a big rails project you kinda need it
[11:52:40] <MikeD_> red45923: http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[11:52:58] <Cork> it is hard to keep ~200+ function files in your head
[11:53:15] <red45923> http://shouldIDoWhatTheClientWants.com
[11:53:23] <Cork> and rails is very folder/files happy
[11:53:44] <MikeD_> red45923: no doubt, just wanted to share :)
[11:54:56] <red45923> not keen myself, tend to take up a huge space above the fold and not add enough to warrant it, but the client says... you know the story
[11:55:00] <Cork> MikeD_: lol that one was quite funny :D
[11:55:49] <Cork> red45923: i tend to try to push towards folds instead if possible
[11:55:52] <EminenceHC> In the HTML can I print a variable that is set in Jquery?
[11:56:12] <CrowX-> i see. well, until then
[11:56:25] <Cork> EminenceHC: uh, html is markup it isn't procedural
[11:56:29] <Cork> it can't DO anything
[11:56:33] <red45923> how do you mean Cork?
[11:56:47] <Cork> EminenceHC: so you should prob rephrase the question
[11:56:53] <BillCriswell> EminenceHC: You'd have to use like $('.some-element').text(someVariable);
[11:57:48] <Cork> red45923: you have like papers and titles on the side
[11:57:53] <Cork> and you shuffle them around
[11:58:05] <decx> don't forget to also put window.print() after that, only then will you truly print a variable
[11:58:07] <Cork> instead of the carousel
[11:59:21] <Cork> red45923: i have a link at work i usually use for it
[11:59:29] <Cork> i'll see if i can find it
[12:00:07] <decx> has nobody actually answered you yet?
[12:00:52] <decx> despite carousels shortcomings, they are requested and there is no established alternative to shove 50 banners above the fold to keep marketing happy
[12:01:09] <decx> flexslider, bxslider, bootstraps carousel are all used by many people
[12:01:19] <BillCriswell> decx: Sad truth.
[12:01:52] <Cork> interesting is that you can do it without the need for much js
[12:02:01] <Cork> like 3-4 lins js can do it
[12:02:23] <decx> if you have a fixed number of slides you don't even need js
[12:02:25] <minionion> decx: If they have half a brain show them the google results of page times on the homepage, and how many banners and how much time each is displayed for. Then bring up the cost of making and added each banner that nooone is seeing. Maybe they will change their mind
[12:02:49] <Cork> decx: the js is if you want the dot marker that moves and that the user can click
[12:03:02] <Cork> but ya if you don't need that then you don't need js at all
[12:03:07] <decx> i actually saw a js less slider with the dots
[12:03:09] <red45923> thats cool decx - now i got a few options to check into
[12:03:14] <decx> damn my lack of bookmarking
[12:03:28] <decx> basicly they were inputs
[12:03:35] <decx> and it was all done with :focus and such
[12:03:43] <Cork> decx: ya, that isn't super hard to do
[12:03:51] <red45923> to add even more carousels to the web, decx - wheres this link then? do you really have an alternative? :)
[12:04:21] <BillCriswell> decx: That sounds icky.
[12:04:28] <BillCriswell> but still kind of clever.
[12:04:29] <decx> just add more screen estate with some minority report shenanigans
[12:04:56] <decx> it's terrible BillCriswell hardcoded everything, yuk
[12:04:57] <red45923> Cork, i meant, sorry
[12:05:24] <Cork> red45923: like i said, i have it at work
[12:05:31] <Cork> and i'm trying to find it again
[12:05:40] <red45923> ah right, no worries,
[12:05:46] <decx> yeah cork what are you even doing here after 5 pm ^^
[12:05:52] <Cork> the worst part about it is that i git it from an rss feed about 3 years ago :/
[12:06:16] <MikeD_> regarding that carousel example:  "omg.... that was dreadful..... and unlike other carousels, this one made its point."
[12:06:18] <Cork> decx: i'm quite often here after 8
[12:06:59] <decx> really?
[12:08:19] <Cork> decx: ya, but i don't talk as much as when earlier on the day :)
[12:09:03] <decx> irc'ing without getting paid isn't as fun :(
[12:09:16] <Cork> decx: it isn't?
[12:09:34] <Cork> heh been doing it for most of my life ^^'
[12:09:35] <naeluh_wed> BillCriswell: index of is what actually worked the best http://fixee.org/paste/povgoqh/#url=wuewird
[12:10:10] <Cork> this one isn't too shabby http://www.alessioatzeni.com/CSS3-Cycle-Image-Slider/
[12:10:11] <naeluh_wed> Cork^
[12:10:15] <decx> yeah, i miss ircing at work most about office work life ;)
[12:10:24] <Cork> (not the one i was looking for though)
[12:12:45] <minionion> My office encourages irc’ing and twittering during work as part of community give back
[12:13:22] <BillCriswell> naeluh_wed: Ah.
[12:13:53] <tomlane> minionion: lucky for some... :P
[12:15:18] <minionion> tomlane: it’s kinda for selfish reasons, but we have found devs from irc rooms also helping people with troubleshooting makes you a much better dev. The phrase “I have forgotten more than they know” is so true. Helping others really helps refresh some of those skills, and also helps with your skills teaching others.
[12:18:16] <red45923> Cork, it is cool to see the css ones, i seen a couple on codepen.io too, they love a bit of pure css on there
[12:18:32] <decx> all that hardcoded animation nonsense
[12:18:42] <decx> taking the d out of html ^^
[12:19:57] <Cork> bah can't find it
[12:20:19] <Cork> but basically it looks like a vertical accordion
[12:20:32] <Cork> but the content doesn't collaps it slides behind
[12:20:33] <red45923> there not as functional as the js ones, but cool ideas, dont really associate just css with carousels
[12:21:23] <minionion> Cork: I made this once, just to see if I could pull it off http://codepen.io/minionion/pen/FyvIA
[12:21:25] <Cork> red45923: if you want the user to be able to interact a lot with how the slides move
[12:21:32] <Cork> then you might need some js
[12:21:42] <Cork> red45923: but you can do most of it in css now days
[12:21:57] <Cork> red45923: i've written quite a few implementations my self
[12:22:08] <Cork> especially as most slideshows on the market SUCKS
[12:22:52] <Cork> minionion: jup :)
[12:23:30] <decx> all that css just to count down haha
[12:24:31] <minionion> it was more to see how to make an infinate scroll with 1 variable, and have scroll up, fade in, stop, scroll up and fade out. Took a lot more than I thought it would to make that work
[12:25:24] <red45923> this is a good css carousel type thing: http://codepen.io/Hornebom/pen/KlLtF
[12:25:37] <decx> now do it 3 times, for 24,60 and 60 minionion ;)
[12:28:02] <Cork> anyway a good first filter for slideshow libs is to check if they have any "setInterval" in the code
[12:28:21] <Cork> sadly it normally removes like 95% of all slideshows on the market
[12:28:41] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: What's wrong with setInterval? AFAIK if it's not really that time sensitive it works fine. If it's a few ms off idgaf.
[12:28:56] <decx> because it can queue up
[12:29:06] <decx> or something
[12:30:03] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: 1. it means the slideshows will animate even if the page isn't visible
[12:30:28] <red45923> setinterval is the one that never stops ? setTimeOut is a once only? requestAnimFrame ?
[12:30:30] <Cork> 2. it means they expect every time event to be perfectly timed, as the next time event will come even if the first one isn't done
[12:30:49] <Cork> 3. that the use isn't interested in having there computer going into sleep mode
[12:30:52] <Cork> and so on
[12:30:59] <Cork> red45923: yes
[12:31:17] <Cork> you should use requestAnimationFrame and in it setTimeout
[12:31:40] <Cork> that way you will at most have one setTimeout loop in queue if the tab goes into background
[12:31:58] <Cork> so the page won't consume cpu cycles just for the fun of it
[12:32:18] <MikeD_> background pages don't fire the setTimeout ?
[12:32:29] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: The browser in general doesn't run when the computer is in sleep mode no? Also can't you just start the setInterval after the page, or all the assets are loaded? And as for number 2, if you've made something, and you know how it works it shouldn't start the next event before the first one is done unless it's minblowingly poorly made. Also a slideshow doesn't need to be perfectly timed IMO.
[12:32:30] <Cork> MikeD_: it does
[12:32:36] <Cork> but not requestAnimationFrame
[12:32:43] <Cork> that is why you use both
[12:32:57] <DeltaHeavy> I've used setInterval knowing it's not perfect, but it worked and served it's purpose well.
[12:33:04] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: setInterval will prevent the computer from going into sleep mode
[12:33:17] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: it can even WAKEN the computer from sleep mode
[12:33:26] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: That sounds like a shitty OS
[12:33:34] <Cork> browsers has to specially try to deal with this problem
[12:33:45] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: i know it is a problem on windows
[12:33:54] <Cork> i think it is a problem on linux
[12:33:57] <Cork> not sure on mac
[12:33:57] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, shitty OS
[12:34:12] <DeltaHeavy> Never had my computer NOT go to sleep on OSX or GNU/Linux
[12:34:13] <MikeD_> seriously, if we can't even resize a window for security/UX reasons, waking people's computer from sleep seems _really_ wrong.
[12:34:16] <DeltaHeavy> Like, when it was supposed to
[12:34:17] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: only os i know it isn't a problem with is android and ios
[12:34:22] <DeltaHeavy> Even when I have lke dozens of tabs open
[12:34:23] <Cork> where background apps gets killed
[12:34:29] <red45923> i think RAF is the current preferred approach but i haven't seen it much except in canvas examples
[12:34:44] <Cork> red45923: it is
[12:34:49] <Cork> and it is easy to do too
[12:35:05] <decx> oh right, i can just put the settimeout inside the requestanimationframe. i used a complicated system of magnets and pulleys and had onblur stop the timeout
[12:35:10] <Cork> red45923: heck jquery introduced the support back when it was new
[12:35:27] <Cork> but had to back it out cause of all shitty slideshow implementations that broke
[12:35:54] <Cork> cause they expected triggering .animation() in a setInterval loop should fire even if the tab wasn't focused
[12:35:55] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: I'm Googling this and I can't find anything that says setInterval stop a computer from going to sleep
[12:36:03] <DeltaHeavy> IMO that'd be a horrid OS flaw
[12:36:26] <red45923> ah, the reality of the web, right i got some carousels to review, thanks chaps
[12:37:22] <decx> so like function drawloop(){ requestAnimationFrame(setTimeout(drawloop,1000/60)) ?
[12:37:22] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: one google query gave me this https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376643
[12:37:42] <Cork> i could most likely find a long list of additional ones for webkit and firefox
[12:37:49] <Cork> ms and opera is closed source so ...
[12:37:53] <Cork> nothing to link there
[12:38:07] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Ok, I see. That doesn't stop it from sleeping, it just derps up when it wakes up.
[12:38:21] <DeltaHeavy> And Opera uses Blink so I'm pretty sure that issue would be in there.
[12:38:23] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: depends on what timer they use
[12:38:49] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: the fine grain timers (needed to give persision smaller then ~20ms)
[12:38:54] <Cork> will prevent sleep mode
[12:39:08] <DeltaHeavy> CorK: Idk, I can't find anything on that specificaly. I've also never seen that problem. I'll need to see something to beleive that.
[12:39:27] <DeltaHeavy> That just sounds too damn awful for me to believe lol
[12:40:43] <Cork> decx: basically you do function step() { setTimeout(function() { /* update */ requestAnimationFrame(step); }, 5000); }
[12:41:19] <Cork> that will fire once every 5 seconds as long as the tab is focused
[12:41:31] <decx> ah, other way around
[12:42:40] <Cork> but ya  function step() { requestAnimationFrame(function() { /* update */ setTimeout((step, 5000); }); } should work too
[12:42:53] <Cork> * function step() { requestAnimationFrame(function() { /* update */ setTimeout(step, 5000); }); } should work too
[12:42:56] <decx> yeah both work
[12:43:27] <Cork> doesn't really matter what order you chain them
[12:43:44] <Cork> what matters is that requestAnimationFrame will stop the animation
[12:43:49] <decx> still not as easy as just counting frames inside the raf ;)
[12:44:06] <decx> t++; if (t>60) t=0 hehe
[12:44:12] <Cork> decx: you should always check the date though
[12:44:22] <Cork> cause you never know where in the animation you are
[12:44:26] <decx> yeah i know
[12:44:35] <Cork> jquery hides this with .animation though
[12:44:42] <Cork> and does this internally
[12:44:42] <decx> but it's fun to ebe free from the shackles of a timeline
[12:45:04] <Cork> decx: it can really mess with the end result thouh
[12:45:38] <decx> didnt you get the memo
[12:45:52] <decx> bob ross coding is the shit now
[12:45:56] <BillCriswell> I always feel so clumsy in dev tools.
[12:45:59] <decx> there are no bugs, only happy features
[12:46:14] <decx> happy unintended*
[12:46:15] <Cork> decx: heh
[12:46:24] <MikeD_> wow, bob ross
[12:46:33] <Cork> got a flash of fs development
[12:46:37] <MikeD_> that guy's got a helluva legacy
[12:46:49] <Cork> - i just lost my 2tb partition
[12:46:59] <Cork> - ya, that is a new feature in the latest version
[12:47:03] <decx> blimey
[12:47:34] <il> hello everybody
[12:47:41] <decx> hi dr nick
[12:47:58] <il> I am not dr nick
[12:48:16] <il> I have come here with questions
[12:48:21] <naeluh_drnick> hello everybody !!!!!!!!

[12:48:53] <decx> well not getting simpsons references isn'T that great of a start but shoot away with your question
[12:48:57] <thebope> lol
[12:49:22] <il> it works great for getting the id of parent element
[12:49:24] <decx> you're traversing the dom only the get the elements id?
[12:49:39] <il> that is, if the parent element is not the first parent element in the prevAll
[12:49:50] <il> oh woops
[12:49:52] <decx> attr will only ever return the first hit in a collection
[12:49:53] <il> $this is not the dom
[12:50:03] <Cork> decx: he uses :first
[12:50:10] <Cork> though ya, that one isn't needed
[12:50:11] <il> $this is $("product-name"), a table cell
[12:50:30] <Cork> il: ok, what is the question?
[12:50:58] <il> How do I get the prevAll to include the current parent element? I tried using "andSelf()" but it is not working as I expected
[12:51:10] <il> It skips the current and gets the first previous element
[12:51:19] <il> first previous parent element*
[12:51:23] <Cork> ?addBack
[12:51:29] <Cork> sigh
[12:51:43] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/addBack/
[12:52:20] <il> Trying that, thanks Cork, let's see if it works
[12:52:31] <il> I am surprised I worded the question well enough for someone to understand
[12:52:35] <Cork> that should work
[12:52:59] <il> full_id = $this.parent().prevAll(".controls-row:first").addBack().attr("id"); Did not work
[12:53:01] <il> Same error
[12:53:32] <Cork> il: could you create a small jsfiddle of the problem?
[12:53:36] <il> Sure
[12:53:48] <il> Well maybe not
[12:53:51] <il> I signed an NDA
[12:53:54] <il> This is market data
[12:54:04] <Cork> heh, ok give me a min
[12:54:32] <il> Thank you
[12:54:41] <il> I can make a pastebin of the function I am using
[12:54:41] <MikeD_> create a jsfiddle doesn't mean copy/paste your NDA content
[12:55:08] <MikeD_> and it'll be disclosed the minute a browser requests the markup  :)
[12:56:23] <il> cork:http://pastebin.com/PyqFfEjj
[12:57:52] <il> Skips first element because the function returns undefined, because there is not previous parent element. The function appends the html because I am hiding a hidden attribute for filtering certain rows. I add the name of the group that the product is in as a hidden attribute so a user can sort by product group.
[12:58:05] <il> (@Cork)^
[12:58:30] <Cork> il: http://jsfiddle.net/VLGZ2/
[12:58:35] <il> The error is small: everything works fine, but at the end of the results is the next product group row, Cork
[12:58:44] <il> Thank you, checking it out
[13:01:01] <Cork> and with that it's "good night vietnam!"
[13:01:05] <Cork> o/
[13:01:39] <Djgerar123>  humans?
[13:02:15] <il> addBack() fixed the problem of the undefined first iteration
[13:02:53] <il> But there is still the problem of the next product group row showing up in the results of the filtering of a certain product group

[13:03:23] <shoky> Djgerar123: calmed down?
[13:03:35] <duch_lunch> somebody is gettin' weird in here.
[13:04:09] <Djgerar123> i love you
[13:04:22] <duch_lunch> awww thx buddy
[13:05:04] <Djgerar123> duch_lunch you are man?
[13:05:15] <duch_lunch> last time i checked.
[13:05:59] <Djgerar123> are you dog?
[13:06:08] <Djgerar123> you are dog?
[13:06:12] <Djgerar123> wow
[13:06:23] <Velveeta> hello? yes, this is dog.
[13:06:38] <Djgerar123> such doge, much wow
[13:06:48] <Djgerar123> yEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[13:06:52] <Djgerar123> I LOVE DOGS
[13:06:59] <Velveeta> i knew something was off about you
[13:07:50] <Djgerar123> VOLVO GIVE DIRETIDE
[13:09:20] <Velveeta> i have no clue what just happened
[13:09:32] <shoky> man loves dogs
[13:09:36] <Velveeta> apparently
[13:09:59] <Velveeta> i love.... desk
[13:10:04] <Velveeta> i love chair..
[13:10:45] <faddah> thank you for doing that, shoky. ugh.
[13:11:05] <Cork> shoky: that remindes me of an op in an old irchighway channel i hanged out in a lot many years ago
[13:11:24] <Cork> he came in and acted like that about every time he got drunk...
[13:12:09] <shoky> even i act like that sometimes.. not here tho ;]
[13:12:24] <Velveeta> right
[13:12:31] <Cork> shoky: without actually indending too? :D
[13:13:00] <Cork> they almost removed his op prives cause he couldn't control what he did when he was drunk >_<
[13:13:10] <shoky> i think he just intended to spread the love.. of dogs
[13:13:19] <Cork> heh
[13:13:31] <Cork> ya, that one was not bad
[13:13:43] <shoky> hehe
[13:14:13] <Cork> kinda felt a bit drunken talk actually
[13:15:07] <shoky> heh he's on #clojure now
[13:15:13] <Cork> heh
[13:15:19] <seannaM> Heya
[13:15:47] <Cork> sigh, why am i still here i should be in bed...
[13:16:35] <BillCriswell> Cork: The internet never sleeps.
[13:16:47] <seannaM> I was curious if anyone knew of some code snippets/regex for validating user submitted CSS in havascript
[13:17:00] <duch_kazatel> O.O
[13:17:01] <decx> is that mexican javascript?
[13:17:02] <seannaM> Or javascript, as some people type it
[13:17:06] <seannaM> I was thinking that
[13:17:07] <Velveeta> jejejej
[13:17:10] <duch_kazatel> hyavascreept
[13:17:18] <Cork> seannaM: validating css in js...
[13:17:29] <shoky> i'd def code in jajascript
[13:17:38] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing that seannaM?
[13:18:03] <Cork> seannaM: i can say this much, it would have to be quite bit more then a snippet :)
[13:18:05] <seannaM> I'm fiddling with adblock plus, and it has a feature where you can add custom css filters
[13:18:22] <Velveeta> favascript.. running chianti.fv as a test library
[13:18:27] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta++
[13:18:27] <seannaM> And you can add bad custom css filters that stop it from working
[13:18:46] <duch_kazatel> also: as i'm working through this mootools migration, I'm really beginning to appreciate jquery.
[13:19:00] <Cork> seannaM: ah, so you want to validate selectors
[13:19:02] <Cork> not css
[13:19:11] <Cork> that would be quite a bit easier
[13:19:37] <seannaM> I think just selectors, let me double check something
[13:20:00] <Velveeta> so do you need to validate selector *syntax*, or that they actually reference a valid node in the document?
[13:20:03] <shoky> probably not this..   try { $(selector) } catch(err) { }
[13:20:20] <shoky> but maybe?!
[13:20:48] <seannaM> Just that they're good syntax, its cool if they don't refer to anything in the document
[13:21:00] <Cork> seannaM: try { document.querySelectorAll('ddh { sdkhfk'); } catch(err) { console.log('error') }
[13:21:07] <duch_kazatel> don't do that in jquery btw - check that against some...
[13:21:10] <duch_kazatel> aaaand cork did it.
[13:21:22] <seannaM> I'll give that a go.
[13:21:46] <seannaM> Thanks!
[13:24:35] <Cork> shoky: $() should work, but... i don't like the uncertenty for if it will try to handle it as something to create dom element from
[13:25:00] <Cork> like $('<div> > <span>')
[13:25:03] <Cork> or something
[13:25:49] <shoky> yeah i was mostly kidding. didn't realize qSA would do the job
[13:26:23] <Cork> well it uses the browsers selector parser
[13:26:30] <Cork> so it will validate it
[13:26:41] <MikeD_> how do i detect that someone has clicked on a radio button that was already checked?
[13:26:48] <shoky> yeah
[13:27:04] <Cork> MikeD_: you could have to have a click listener on it
[13:27:13] <Cork> could == would
[13:27:23] <MikeD_> but doesn't clicking a radio button make it checked?
[13:27:36] <Cork> ya?
[13:27:41] <Cork> after the click event
[13:29:09] <eskatrem> Hey, I made a web page with some keyboard, when you click on a touch it sends the text to a text area. the problem is that is stop working after the text area is edited (with the physical keyboard). Can someone have a look? http://jsfiddle.net/7T9e3/4/
[13:29:58] <Cork> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/YPvnW/
[13:32:36] <eskatrem> zacharytamas: having fun changing your name?
[13:32:48] <Cork> eskatrem: .append => .val
[13:33:10] <Cork> eskatrem: you should never use append on form elements
[13:33:16] <MikeD_> http://jsfiddle.net/YPvnW/1/
[13:33:38] <__joshua___> eskatrem: http://jsfiddle.net/7T9e3/6/
[13:33:40] <zacharytamas> eskatrem Perhaps
[13:34:21] <decx> that's an unecessary double check on #input-zone __joshua___
[13:34:21] <Cork> MikeD_: http://jsfiddle.net/YPvnW/2/
[13:35:03] <__joshua___> double check?  you mean the double jq construction?
[13:35:31] <decx> yeah you can do like: var input = $(this).text; $("#input-zone").val(function(_,val){ return val += input })
[13:35:39] <decx> or saomething
[13:35:58] <CocoStorm> what does $(this) refer to within an .on('click') method?
[13:35:59] <eskatrem> Cork: ok, I didn;t know that val could take an element.
[13:36:00] <__joshua___> sure
[13:36:11] <__joshua___> its not takening an element, its taking a string
[13:36:13] <eskatrem> __joshua___: thanks
[13:36:31] <eskatrem> what's wrong with append, though?
[13:37:00] <Cork> eskatrem: it doesn't it takes the string
[13:37:14] <Cork> eskatrem: append modifies the dom, not the state of the form element
[13:37:35] <Cork> eskatrem: and the state gets disconnected from the dom content after the user modifys it
[13:37:36] <__joshua___> append to for adding elements and such
[13:37:39] <eskatrem> Cork: Oh yeah, for this particular case I dont want to modify the DOM
[13:37:55] <eskatrem> adding elements, like an item to a list?
[13:37:58] <Cork> eskatrem: you ever want to modify the dom to change content in a form element
[13:38:08] <Cork> uh...
[13:38:11] <Cork> *you never
[13:38:23] <decx> it's a bit confusing because textarea gets a closing tag and doesnt have a value attribute
[13:38:38] <Cork> decx: in html ya
[13:38:38] <decx> or maybe it does and i just never used it
[13:38:39] <__joshua___> yeah, textareas are odd
[13:38:56] <Cork> but they becomes a single dom element
[13:39:02] <decx> ye
[13:39:07] <Cork> so it isn't strange after the parse is done
[13:39:14] <CocoStorm> hi what does $(this) refer to within an .on('click') method?
[13:39:24] <Cork> CocoStorm: the clicked element
[13:39:30] <MikeD_> Cork: is there a keyboard accessible version of that including mouse action on the label?
[13:39:53] <Danielss89> Hi
[13:40:02] <Cork> MikeD_: you prob need to bind keyup
[13:40:03] <Danielss89> I’m creating a chrome plugin
[13:40:04] <__joshua___> the element, or delegated element, that the listener was attached to, right?  (not necessarily the target)
[13:40:06] <CocoStorm> Cork, and to get the dom of that clicked element I could do $(this).html() ?
[13:40:20] <Danielss89> and i want to read the content of an iframe which src is not the domain i’m on
[13:40:23] <Danielss89> is that not possible
[13:40:24] <__joshua___> you want the dom element? $(this)[0]
[13:40:26] <Cork> CocoStorm: no the dom element is explicitly "this"
[13:40:33] <decx> lol $(this)[0]
[13:40:33] <__joshua___> oh yeah, this
[13:40:35] <Velveeta> miked_: you can just bind a change event listener to it, and then calculate the opposite of what the current value is
[13:40:37] <__joshua___> hahaha
[13:40:42] <Velveeta> that would catch mouse and keyboard toggles
[13:40:46] <decx> that's just too funny haha
[13:40:56] <__joshua___> just woke up decx
[13:41:21] <decx> i have similar brainfarts after waking up
[13:41:24] <Cork> __joshua___: $(this).first()[0] :)
[13:41:29] <decx> that's why i never go on irc before 12
[13:41:37] <decx> or talk to people
[13:41:40] <decx> or look at people
[13:41:44] <decx> or move
[13:42:09] <Cork> $(this).last().first().get(0)
[13:42:16] <Cork> i should stop now...
[13:42:26] <decx> didnt you o/ like an hour ago?
[13:42:34] <Cork> ya
[13:42:39] <decx> now i'm glad i didn't \o back
[13:42:40] <Cork> and then there was a spammer
[13:42:45] <Cork> i blame it all on him
[13:42:51] <decx> if only becuase i didnt ctrl-enter
[13:42:59] <decx> \o
[13:43:17] <__joshua___> $(this).parent().find(this)...... i will stop too
[13:43:19] <decx> oh i ignored that guy after the spam
[13:43:22] <decx> did i miss anything good?
[13:44:22] <Cork> __joshua___: that one might actually break though
[13:44:38] <__joshua___> on document?
[13:44:48] <Cork> if the element isn't attached
[13:44:55] <__joshua___> good point
[13:45:22] <__joshua___> you could wrap('<div/>').parent().find(....
[13:45:31] <Cork> lol
[13:46:15] <Cork> that reminds me of a new user doing $($(this).html()) to get the effect of $(this).clone()
[14:11:06] <seannaM> hmm
[14:11:21] <seannaM> Seems there's some bad css that QSA doesn't catch
[14:14:54] <CocoStorm> So, I can use .one() to have the onclick unbind itself after one click but what if i want to do something onclick once and then do other things after ?
[14:18:09] <duch_kazatel> CocoStorm clarify.
[14:18:29] <duch_kazatel> you want something on the first click, and then something different on subsequent clicks?
[14:18:34] <crash1hd> if I have a $(this) which returns <div>my text<span>other text</span></div> and I want to do a query like $(this).contents(':not(span)').text() what am I missing?
[14:18:52] <duch_kazatel> crash1hd you want "my text" out of that?
[14:18:58] <crash1hd> yes
[14:19:00] <CocoStorm> duch_kazatel, yea
[14:19:18] <duch_kazatel> crash1hd http://stackoverflow.com/a/4399718/923919
[14:19:40] <duch_kazatel> CocoStorm then you want a normal .on() and have a counter that tracks how nany times the handler has been run.
[14:20:04] <CocoStorm> duch_kazatel, I see
[14:20:27] <duch_kazatel> CocoStorm your other option is to run a new event binding inside the handler you register inside your .one(), but that will be confusing down the road.
[14:21:06] <CocoStorm> so have .one('click', function(event) { $(this).on('click' ?
[14:21:25] <decx> track the clicks, it's easier
[14:21:36] <CocoStorm> hm I guess
[14:21:43] <duch_kazatel> CocoStorm that will function, but it will be confusing - have a variable hold that data instead.
[14:22:14] <duch_kazatel> CocoStorm in general, you want one handler for an event, instead of many.
[14:22:35] <duch_kazatel> adding and removing gets messy, so just add once and then check inside to see what to do.
[14:22:36] <CocoStorm> I see
[14:23:14] <CocoStorm> i'll do that then
[14:23:15] <CocoStorm> thanks duch_kazatel
[14:23:53] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:24:33] <CocoStorm> also
[14:24:50] <decx> what was the shortcut for, if undefined put 0
[14:25:03] <decx> | 0 ?
[14:25:25] <crash1hd> duch_kazatel, Thanks :)
[14:25:26] <duch_kazatel> mything = mything || 0;
[14:25:34] <duch_kazatel> or use a ternary.
[14:25:39] <decx> ah right ||
[14:25:41] <decx> knew it
[14:25:43] <decx> ^^
[14:25:56] <duch_kazatel> i am dealing with that atm.
[14:26:10] <duch_kazatel> and i want to stab myself in the eye because i'm running into other problems with it.
[14:26:12] <decx> more ternary in selectors?
[14:26:49] <duch_kazatel> thething = ((thething != null) ? thething : 0);
[14:27:01] <duch_kazatel> really shitty scoping problems atm.
[14:27:33] <duch_kazatel> aaaand figured it out.
[14:28:09] <duch_kazatel> CocoStorm did you have something else?
[14:31:13] <CocoStorm> duch_kazatel, I use $(this).html() within the click handler to get the currently selected DOM but sometimes I need the elements two above
[14:31:17] <CocoStorm> is there a better way of doing
[14:31:27] <duch_kazatel> "two above"
[14:31:30] <CocoStorm> $(this).parent().parent().find('class').html()
[14:31:38] <duch_kazatel> .parents('selector');
[14:32:01] <duch_kazatel> seeing the markup might be helpful.
[14:32:01] <CocoStorm> .parents('.class')?
[14:32:02] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:32:04] <CocoStorm> oh
[14:32:07] <decx> i assume .class isnt a parent but an unrelated element
[14:32:35] <CocoStorm> decx, can't remember.  I need to have my laptop with me
[14:32:42] <CocoStorm> I should get it tomorrow
[14:32:42] <CocoStorm> and
[14:32:45] <CocoStorm> I'll come back here :)
[14:54:24] <Horacsio> can anyone comment this http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/CLfrQ/2/ if this makes sense, or could be better script to be loaded under iphone 5s?
[14:54:24] <duch_kazatel> cache selectors.
[14:55:22] <erming> i think you can even put IDs on meta elements
[14:58:06] <duch_kazatel> in fact you can - Horacsio what are you trying to do here?
[14:58:14] <duch_kazatel> why are you dynamically modifying the meta viewport?
[14:59:42] <Horacsio> I need the site to fit iphones
[14:59:52] <Horacsio> and ipads
[14:59:57] <Horacsio> and desktops
[15:00:15] <duch_kazatel> then do a responsive site.
[15:00:23] <duch_kazatel> with media queries instead.
[15:00:23] <Horacsio> no budget for that
[15:00:58] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* then you're going to have a terrible mobile experience.
[15:00:59] <Horacsio> thats why I try to equalize things this way… yet I’m not sure if this is ok
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> don't do it that way.
[15:01:15] <Horacsio> then how?
[15:01:35] <duch_kazatel> media queries and build out an actual responsive site ;)
[15:02:08] <Horacsio> oh the way there’s no budget to do?
[15:02:16] <dave_s> I'm trying to figure out a straight-forward way to apply the contextual "success" class to a table row (for edit-in-place) and then fade it away.
[15:02:34] <Horacsio> I just want to fit the layout as-is into the screen
[15:02:39] <dave_s> Is this possible at all to fade class out, or off, of an element?
[15:03:02] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio is it even going to function at the default size?
[15:03:32] <duch_kazatel> dave_s hrm?  you mean to animate a few properties?
[15:09:00] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: Well, yeah, but I was hoping to do it with a CSS Class because it's a table with table-striped BS3 class added, and fadding it off with just background-color is going to cause problems.
[15:09:25] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1248542/jquery-animate-with-css-class-only-without-explicit-styles
[15:09:36] <duch_kazatel> that's about the best you can do if you want to animate classes.
[15:09:46] <duch_kazatel> animating colors is a whole 'nother story.
[15:10:04] <duch_kazatel> also: animating a class will involve animate each property.
[15:10:17] <duch_kazatel> *animating
[15:10:27] <duch_kazatel> so you have the same problems.
[15:12:34] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: I tried that, but when I use $elem.toggle('class', 10000); the class pops into existance instantly.
[15:13:07] <Horacsio> sure it is working at the default size! why do you ask?
[15:13:29] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio then leave it be.
[15:14:22] <dave_s> And doing $target.addClass('success').removeClass('success', 10000); just adds and removes the class so fast you can't see it.
[15:14:34] <duch_kazatel> right.. because that's not doing what you think it is...
[15:15:11] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: But I have the jquery.colors plugin included.
[15:15:15] <duch_kazatel> .toggle()'s syntax doesn't support the first syntax.
[15:15:55] <duch_kazatel> none of what you've posted works.
[15:16:04] <duch_kazatel> because none of it is valid >.>
[15:16:21] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: What do you mean?
[15:16:44] <dave_s> $.toggleClass() takes a duration...
[15:16:48] <duch_kazatel> where did you get the syntax .toggle('success', 10000)
[15:17:06] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: It was a typo, I meant toggleClass(...,[])
[15:17:10] <duch_kazatel> that doesn'
[15:17:14] <duch_kazatel> *doesn't take a duration.
[15:17:33] <dave_s> Um.... it does: (?) http://api.jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[15:17:47] <duch_kazatel> where on that page are you seeing that it takes a duration?
[15:17:58] <dave_s> .toggleClass( className [, switch ] [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] )
[15:18:08] <duch_kazatel> oh jquery ui
[15:18:10] <dave_s> In the black bar at the top in bold.
[15:18:13] <duch_kazatel> derp
[15:18:18] <dave_s> :P
[15:18:33] * dave_s eats another kit kat
[15:18:36] <duch_kazatel> can you fiddle your stuff then?
[15:19:48] <dave_s> Don'y suppose there's a JS Fiddle template with all the includes setup, is there?
[15:21:33] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/skhOh4e.png
[15:21:37] <duch_kazatel> need to select jquery 1.9.1
[15:21:55] <duch_kazatel> or 2.0.2
[15:22:08] <duch_kazatel> and then add the color script as an external resource.
[15:24:48] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: Yeah, but JUI needs to come from the Google CDN to use it in the fiddle. Setting these things up is always a collossal pain in the ass.
[15:25:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:25:05] <duch_kazatel> why does jui need to come from the google cdn?
[15:31:03] <motaka2> How can I add a private function or memeber to this type of variable definition? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/42e6d76e1aee586787ef
[15:32:49] <systemfault> motaka2: No such thing as a hidden variable in JS.
[15:33:05] <systemfault> motaka2: The convention is to prefix “private” variables with an underscore
[15:33:58] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 yeah JS doesn't support that part of encapsulation.
[15:34:09] <motaka2> systemfault: system if i use var keyword in a constructor function that var will be private. but in object notation we dont have this /
[15:34:22] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you can sort of emulate it, but it's still not the same.
[15:34:39] <systemfault> motaka2: No, it won’t be private, it’s only local to the function.
[15:35:20] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html here are your options, basically.  object literals don't support hiding things.
[15:35:23] <motaka2> systemfault: Ok
[15:35:42] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: ok
[15:36:47] <HowardwLo> whats the best way to clean out contents of an element? I'm replacing data with XHR
[15:36:49] <motaka2> What is use of object literals ? I think using Constructor functions with keyword new is a lot better
[15:37:33] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 the new keyword forces you to lug around a prototype you might not need.
[15:37:38] <duch_kazatel> it all depends on your style.
[15:38:00] <duch_kazatel> crockford would tell you that normally, you don't need to use constructors.  I tend to agree.
[15:39:04] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: a company gave me a test to see how much I know javascript. I want to show them what I know. But I cant decide how to do that
[15:39:12] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[15:39:14] <HowardwLo> i'm trying to use http://api.jquery.com/empty/ .empty(), but it also remove sthe parent element
[15:39:17] <duch_kazatel> create a private member in an object?
[15:39:46] <duch_kazatel> HowardwLo .empty() only removes all child nodes, not the parent - you sure your selector is good?
[15:39:50] <systemfault> motaka2: If you want to emulate private variable, it’s easy… just create a factory function that returns a literal.
[15:40:03] <dave_s_> [18:30] <dave_s> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/4rnh3/
[15:40:42] <duch_kazatel> noooo don't use return false; :(
[15:41:10] <duch_kazatel> wtf why are you custom loading jquery and jquery ui?
[15:41:53] <duch_kazatel> either way.
[15:42:43] <duch_kazatel> how do i emulate what you're looking to do?
[15:43:17] <HowardwLo> Ah. it seems i failed the selector part. Thanks
[16:09:35] <motaka2> lets say I have var data=[{...},{...},{...}]; in a.js and I need data in b.js and in html document I did <script src="a.js" /> <script src="b.js" /> does that mean I should be sure that I have data in b.js ?
[16:13:56] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 did you try?
[16:15:02] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Try what ?
[16:15:16] <duch_kazatel> making a page and testing?
[16:16:54] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: Yes, data is always available in second page. But can I be sure ?
[16:18:32] <StephenS> how can I call .click, with two functions, once when I click and second time to call other function when I click on anchor again?
[16:18:37] <StephenS> or that is just for .hover?
[16:19:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:20:12] <duch_kazatel> StephenS you mean changing what happens when you click more than once?
[16:20:18] <StephenS> yes
[16:20:25] <jphase> StephenS: toggle a class or something :)
[16:20:29] <StephenS> like you have on and off?
[16:20:38] <duch_kazatel> you need to declare a variable that counts how many times you've clicked.
[16:20:44] <duch_kazatel> don't unbind the handler - check that var and act accordingly.
[16:21:04] <StephenS> nah toggle is what I needed :D
[16:21:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:21:30] <ksefchik> I'm experiencing oddness with events -- when I check the value of an input in response to a change or keypress event, the values are always one event behind. https://gist.github.com/7253bcce07f58ac3e0d4
[16:21:32] <duch_kazatel> for show/hide?
[16:21:34] <jphase> if($(this).hasClass('on')) { // do on stuff } else { // do off stuff };  $(this).toggleClass('on');
[16:21:42] <StephenS> duch_kazatel yes
[16:22:01] <duch_kazatel> StephenS good - don't use the toggle as in "run one func then the other func"
[16:22:16] <StephenS> yeah I use it only for one func ruc
[16:22:17] <StephenS> run
[16:23:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:23:36] <jphase> ksefchik: keypress is before the value reaches the input - use keyup
[16:23:42] <duch_kazatel> StephenS there are two versions of .toggle()
[16:24:05] <StephenS> I know, I use .toggle and it works fine, jQuery is really nice you already have plenty of methods implemented.
[16:24:17] <ksefchik> jphase: thanks!
[16:25:35] <StephenS> hmm how can I change value of text with toggle?
[16:26:18] <StephenS> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ you see a button Toggle in example, I want to change that value on each click
[16:26:23] <StephenS> to Close/Show...
[16:26:38] <__joshua___> $(sel).toggle(function(){ $(this).val(1);}, function(){ $(this).val(2);}) ?
[16:28:13] <StephenS> not working
[16:30:45] <__joshua___> i may have made that up, one mo
[16:31:18] <StephenS> I tweaked it to text and actual classes, but it does not work.
[16:32:35] <duch_kazatel> the old "run one thing, then another" syntax was deprecated/removed.
[16:32:54] <BillCriswell> Thank god.
[16:33:05] <StephenS> ...
[16:33:14] <__joshua___> ah "This overload of toggle function was removed in jQuery 1."
[16:33:14] <StephenS> so I had to do it with IF's?
[16:33:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that one method having two radically different signatures really messed with my head.
[16:33:28] <duch_kazatel> StephenS that's what i was telling you earlier.
[16:33:29] <BillCriswell> StephenS: http://jsbin.com/cumecowa/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:33:31] <__joshua___> i agree
[16:33:33] <StephenS> ...
[16:35:20] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/cumecowa/2/edit?js,output a little better maybe
[16:36:09] <StephenS> yeah I know all that it was variation, I was just searching for a simpler way.
[16:39:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8s6LQ/
[16:39:40] <duch_kazatel> i used this to replace one of our uses of .toggle() at one point.
[16:40:38] <duch_kazatel> not perfect, but a starting point.
[16:43:10] <StephenS> I can't do something like this: http://pastebin.com/d8iL0AYG ?
[16:43:39] <duch_kazatel> if you wrote it right, sure.
[16:44:11] <StephenS> I did
[16:44:15] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:44:21] <duch_kazatel> if ( ("#editname").val() == "Edit") { isn't valid.
[16:44:27] <StephenS> but I get syntax error, undefined function.
[16:44:36] <duch_kazatel> right, because your code is wrong.
[16:44:53] <StephenS> what?
[16:45:15] <duch_kazatel> if ( ("#editname").val() == "Edit") {
[16:45:20] <duch_kazatel> do you see what's missing there?
[16:45:46] <StephenS> what
[16:45:56] <StephenS> a function? I call methods inside if.
[16:46:00] <duch_kazatel> aaaand again - that line is wrong.  do you see the missing dollar sign?
[16:46:09] <duch_kazatel> http://pastebin.com/RNhdRHbL
[16:46:15] <duch_kazatel> you want if ($("#editname").val() === "Edit") {
[16:46:37] <duch_kazatel> ("#editname").text("Edit"); was wrong, too.
[16:47:01] <DHowett_> Spoiler: it's for the same reason
[16:47:07] <DHowett_> (so you don't have to get the runaround again ;))
[16:47:09] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[16:47:10] <StephenS> blah
[16:47:17] <duch_kazatel> cache your selectors, too.
[16:47:34] <StephenS> why console does not say anything about that specific error?
[16:47:51] <duch_kazatel> it did.
[16:48:01] <duch_kazatel> how does the console know what you meant in that case?
[16:48:17] <DHowett_> StephenS: $ is simply a function object. the console can't tell you that it's missing, just as it can't tell you that your program cannot, in fact, solve for pi or calculate the distance between the earth and the moon
[16:48:34] <duch_kazatel> plainly: it doesn't know.
[16:48:47] <StephenS> and .val get's value of an object?
[16:49:16] <DHowett_> StephenS: it did, however, tell you what it DID know: you tried to call the member 'val' on an object of type string, and string does not have that member
[16:49:18] <duch_kazatel> .val() gets the value of an input.
[16:49:35] <StephenS> <a href="#" id="editname">Edit</a>
[16:49:39] <StephenS> is value of it Edit?
[16:49:43] <duch_kazatel> StephenS what's the value there?
[16:49:47] <duch_kazatel> that's .text()
[16:50:07] <StephenS> ty
[16:50:15] <duch_kazatel> $('#editname').text()
[16:50:50] <duch_kazatel> woops
[16:51:17] <DHowett_> Generally, using the contents of some DOM element as a string is not going to be what you're looking for.. like, are you intending on changing that element's contents? and you don't want to do the Edit action if it doesn't explicitly *say* edit?
[16:52:08] <DHowett_> (And if so: what if you localize the app in the future? and then the button says "Bearbeiten" or something. Now it doesn't say Edit, but it's still an edit button!)
[16:52:23] <StephenS> ill localize jquery code ;)
[16:52:33] <StephenS> I mix dynamic and static code ;)
[16:52:40] <duch_kazatel> O.O
[16:52:50] <duch_kazatel> "dynamic code" is a terrifying thing when talking about javascript.
[16:52:52] <DHowett_> you should instead mix "correct" code (with correct paradigms)
[16:52:52] <DHowett_> :P
[16:53:13] <duch_kazatel> DHowett_ if they're having a hard time seeing that they forgot $, something tells me the rest of your advice is going to fall on deaf ears.
[16:53:25] <DHowett_> duch_kazatel: you win
[16:53:26] <StephenS> well that will be in future
[16:53:31] <DHowett> duch_kazatel: ;)
[16:53:48] <duch_kazatel> StephenS in the future, you want to separate your logic from your data.
[16:53:54] <duch_kazatel> entirely.
[16:55:17] <StephenS> I'm already doing that
[16:55:33] <StephenS> I am writing OOP code which is fully separate from gui.
[16:55:38] <StephenS> separated*
[16:56:01] <duch_kazatel> StephenS you are not if you're doing things like relying on an element's .text9)
[16:56:06] <duch_kazatel> *.text()
[16:56:13] <StephenS> yeah I can set value.
[16:56:23] <duch_kazatel> no you can't.
[16:56:28] <duch_kazatel> .val() is for inputs.
[16:56:34] <duch_kazatel> and that's still mixing data and logic.
[16:59:35] <DHowett> StephenS: if you are checking the contents of an element that you have created (not user input)..... that is the farthest thing from separating your GUI and Logic as humanly possible
[17:43:48] <legrandin> hey guys, having trouble with an ajax call. i want it to change certain dom elements after it has succeeded, and I can't quite seem to make it work. here's the code: http://bpaste.net/show/m0i4rBmVWGDdoQmNBQRI/
[17:51:40] <beancurd> legrandin: is your ajaxcall succeeding?
[17:53:39] <legrandin> yes
[17:54:21] <beancurd> awesome.
[17:54:26] <legrandin> its something that tracks attendance. i want the check boxes greyed out when the students are present
[17:54:41] <legrandin> this is for a django app
[17:54:43] <beancurd> try $(this) instead of this
[17:55:02] <beancurd> $(this).prop
[17:55:15] <legrandin> no quites?
[17:55:18] <legrandin> quotes
[17:56:10] <beancurd> $("#left").each(blh blah blah if ($(this).prop blah blah.
[17:56:56] <beancurd> what i'm getting at is, your selector within your each loop probably isn't picking anything up.
[17:57:02] <legrandin> well
[17:57:18] <legrandin> see i have this other script that selects every check box, a select all script
[17:57:29] <legrandin> and the syntax is just like that, and it works
[17:57:35] <beancurd> ah.
[17:57:42] <beancurd> do you have this live somewhere?
[17:57:59] <legrandin> nope, local server running django
[17:58:08] <beancurd> alright,
[17:58:37] <beancurd> i would usually put a bunch of console.log's in places just to see what's firing and what's being picked up.
[17:59:07] <legrandin> i guess i can try that
[18:00:15] <legrandin> maybe i need to do a different function call?
[18:00:35] <legrandin> er function variable. i men what is the success function supposed to do with data exactly
[18:00:45] <legrandin> nothing im doing has anything to do with data
[18:06:14] <legrandin> none of the console.log statements run when i run the ajax call! ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
[18:16:01] <beancurd> legrandin: heh. so.. your call isn't returning success?
[18:16:14] <legrandin> well, its posting to the database fine
[18:16:16] <beancurd> django might be picking up and doing whatever it's being told to, but then it's not returning anything.
[18:16:19] <beancurd> yea.
[18:16:24] <legrandin> hmm
[18:16:34] <beancurd> but is django returning '200'
[18:16:46] <legrandin> nope, 204 :D
[18:17:07] <legrandin> ill try changing that
[18:17:23] <legrandin> man this webdev shit is hard
[18:17:35] <beancurd> yeah webdev be a pain
[18:17:42] <legrandin> good pain though
[18:18:03] <beancurd> i have a client who's surname is legrand
[18:18:34] <legrandin> cool
[18:18:44] <legrandin> legrandin is acually a character from a novel
[18:19:48] <legrandin> alright i found this .done() function im gonna try, see if that helps
[18:20:34] <beancurd> airght.
[18:20:38] <legrandin> actually i think the problem is on the django side of things
[18:21:04] <legrandin> django isnt telling the ajax call that it succeeded even though it dod
[18:21:44] <beancurd> whelp. there you go.
[18:26:23] <aagii> hi guys
[18:27:50] <aagii> Fatal error: Only variables can be passed by reference in...
[18:27:51] <aagii> How to post values to cross domain?
[18:28:25] <eip56> What kind of data is coming in
[18:28:30] <eip56> json?
[18:29:03] <aagii> using $.post()
[18:29:56] <aagii> $.post('htttp://web/get.feedback.php',{type:type, title:title, fname:fname, lname:lname, email:email,message:message})
[18:34:52] <jphase> aagii: sounds like your error is more related to PHP than it is to jQuery. Is your data going through fine in your network tab and is the CORS request working without access-control-allow-origin issues?
[18:40:25] <laserbeak431> hi, is there a way to make a slideshow of elements other than images?
[18:41:34] <__joshua___> same thing
[18:46:06] <laserbeak431> __joshua___: was that a yes?
[18:46:30] <__joshua___> and image is an element, so, yes.
[18:47:57] <laserbeak431> thanks :)
[18:48:22] <jphase> laserbeak431: most sliders made >= 5 years ago support any type of element you want by passing it in the selector
[18:50:06] <jphase> s/it/the parent
[18:54:48] <laserbeak431> jphase: will do thanks
[19:07:42] <unnu> stupid question: how can i keep a var consistant after i do an ajax call?
[19:08:48] <unnu> like if i have a set of two select inputs and i pull the option values via ajax, is there a correct way to make it so that the option selected in the first dropdown is not selectable in the second one?
[19:11:05] <jphase> unnu: I suppose you could set a variable to the options in your select before your ajax call and use that :\
[19:11:10] <jphase> hi btw ;]
[19:11:21] <unnu> hey jphase
[19:11:27] <unnu> i am pulling the options via rest
[19:11:35] <unnu> json array in, options out
[19:11:54] <unnu> i decided i will just populate all the lists at once, then disable the second two
[19:12:14] <jphase> kinda hard to know what you're talking about without seeing it
[19:12:14] <unnu> then when the first one changes, i will enable it and .remove() the option from the second one
[19:12:21] <unnu> i will show you in pm
[19:12:25] <jphase> k
[19:40:31] <il> hello all
[19:41:39] <il> anyone here?
[19:42:25] <jphase> yep
[19:48:35] <il> how are there 740 people here
[19:48:37] <il> but no one talks
[19:48:52] <il> everyone is just idle huh
[19:52:01] <shoky> better than 740 people talking
[19:56:42] <BillCris_> shoky: True.
[19:56:48] <BillCris_> About the... talking thing.
[20:37:54] <Warfront1> how do i do $('#UpdateButton'+id)
[20:38:02] <Warfront1> id is just a string
[20:38:09] <Warfront1> or will that just work
[21:17:27] <abishek> does anybody know multi color picker using jquery?
[21:19:30] <jphase> mutli?
[21:19:37] <jphase> multi*?
[21:20:26] <abishek> is there a plugin using which I could select multiple colors instead of one
[21:20:54] <jphase> abishek: you could just bind the colorpicker of your choosing to multiple elements
[21:22:08] <abishek> jphase, i was thinking more on the lines of swatches that can be multi-selected
[21:23:33] <jphase> abishek: well you can use colorpickers like http://baijs.com/tinycolorpicker/ that allows for preset swatches, image picking, and all that jazz... but overall I am pretty sure most color picker plugins bind to whatever selector you use. It's up to you to bind the picker to 1 or more elements
[21:23:59] <jphase> I don't know of any custom select input that happens to have color picker swatches magically bound to their child options though, no
[21:24:15] <abishek> ok
[21:24:45] <jphase> it'd be pretty easy to change the values of a multiple select element (even a hidden one) based on the colors picked though
[21:53:17] <abishek> anybody know of a jquery slider with pips that allows moving between pips like http://monosnap.com/image/DxbtwkvYh1hXwBNZkEsnIjixQRIdKW
[22:02:18] <morfin> how do i validate user input if he just pressed button
[22:03:15] <jphase> morfin: bind a validation function to the button's click event
[22:03:42] <morfin> i mean keypress
[22:03:51] <morfin> if he did not release that button
[22:06:15] <jphase> morfin: well keypress and keydown events fire before the value reaches the input, so if you wanted to validate the input then you'd have to use $(this).val() + String.fromCharCode(key) and validate that value
[22:06:15] <Uhkis> $(document).on('keypress' function(e){do something}); ?
[22:06:49] <jphase> ciscor: spamming is for nubs
[22:07:46] <morfin> oh
[22:07:51] <morfin> he spammed you too
[22:08:04] <Uhkis> show gratis, huh?
[22:08:12] <morfin> keypress happens only when he release button
[22:08:28] <jphase> morfin: that's actually "keyup"
[22:08:30] <jphase> appropriately named
[22:08:32] <morfin> wait
[22:08:55] <Uhkis> keydown then
[22:10:10] <jphase> keyup is probably the easier one to use since you can just validate $(this).val()
[22:10:26] <jphase> depends on if you want to validate before the key hits the input or not
[22:10:43] <morfin> oh keypress works if i just press button and hold it
[22:10:44] <morfin> hmmm
[22:10:59] <morfin> i always had a problem with validation like that
[22:11:27] <jphase> validation events usually happen on submit anyhow
[22:11:40] <jphase> you might want to look into input masking if you're doing anything else
[22:12:00] <morfin> because some keys(Esc,backspace etc) does not trigger keypress
[22:12:20] <Uhkis> they don't?
[22:12:22] <jphase> those should actually trigger
[22:12:25] <morfin> nope
[22:12:31] <morfin> i am using console.log
[22:12:45] <morfin> and nothing happens on esc\backspace in chrome
[22:12:50] <morfin> not sure about other browsers
[22:13:20] <jphase> I guarantee they do, it depends on what you're binding to
[22:13:33] <morfin> input
[22:13:38] <jphase> I specifically had to allow them in my force numeric function:  http://robido.com/blog/jquery/jquery-method-force-numeric-input-element-cmd-ctrl-actions-allow-select-page-refresh/
[22:13:51] <morfin> probably i should bind esc not to an input
[22:13:59] <morfin> but to document itseld
[22:14:02] <morfin> *itself
[22:15:19] <Uhkis> on firefox, esc = 27, backspace = 8
[22:15:52] <jphase> it's really the keyboard rather than the browser - they should be the same in chrome and all that
[22:16:09] <elvis4526> Hi, i have to send a get request to a restful api, with dataType: "jsonp", but the returned data is in json
[22:16:11] <jphase> if you're validating on any of the key events, I'd suggest using a masking plugin to just not allow stuff you don't want morfin... i.e. http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[22:16:13] <Uhkis> tried on keydown
[22:16:20] <elvis4526> how can I parse the returning data in json ?
[22:16:30] <elvis4526> i tried dataType: "jsonp json" it didn't work
[22:17:09] <jphase> elvis4526: don't use jsonp - it's a hack, just use dataType: 'json'  or even $.getJSON instead
[22:17:26] <jphase> if you need to parse, you can use var data = $.parseJSON(response);
[22:18:30] <elvis4526> I can't use just "json" because of the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[22:18:39] <morfin> nope
[22:18:56] <morfin> in chrome i noticed that problem long time ago
[22:19:09] <DHowett> the type of data should be completely unrelated to access control headers.. huh.
[22:19:11] <jphase> elvis4526: json and jsonp both require the server to bet setup for that
[22:19:50] <jphase> elvis4526: do you have control over the REST server?
[22:20:09] <elvis4526> No that's the thing
[22:20:24] <jphase> elvis4526: you might want to look into http://corsproxy.com then
[22:21:29] <jphase> REST APIs that return JSON and don't allow all origins make me giggle
[22:22:43] <morfin> strange
[22:22:52] <abishek> how can i make the jquery slider to show intrevals like http://monosnap.com/image/DxbtwkvYh1hXwBNZkEsnIjixQRIdKW?
[22:22:57] <elvis4526> I'm a first timer in these kinda of thing, but yeah I kinda think that was weird lol
[22:23:06] <elvis4526> it's twilio if your interested
[22:23:10] * tw2113 tickles jphase so he can claim to make jphase giggle too
[22:24:01] <jphase> heh, it's as if they're saying "yeah, JSON is meant to be read by humans in-browser"...
[22:24:26] <jphase> well granted, it's probably an API that they use internally and they want no network overhead
[22:24:37] <jphase> but in that case, don't allow people to browse to it?
[22:24:46] <tw2113> don't make excuses for them
[22:25:25] <jphase> some people's kids....  pfft
[22:25:40] <tw2113> and then there's everyone else on earth besides me :D
[22:25:58] <jphase> hehe, you sound like everyone on the freeway tw2113
[22:25:58] <morfin> as i said: keypress don't fire for backspace
[22:26:03] <morfin> and that's stupid :(
[22:26:18] <jphase> morfin: use keydown
[22:26:37] <morfin> but what if i pressed backspace without releasing it?
[22:26:51] <jphase> that's still down is it not?
[22:27:09] <morfin> secong
[22:27:21] <elvis4526> Okay, but why when I enter the url in a browser, it work ?
[22:27:34] <elvis4526> Does Chrome makes the dataType jsonp by magic ?
[22:27:52] <morfin> oh it fires many times
[22:27:56] <jphase> no, jsonp still needs to be prepped for the hackish ? on the server
[22:28:05] <morfin> like i press backspace many times
[22:28:27] <jphase> elvis4526: because their sysadmin decided it's an internal API yet they allow people to browse to it lol, doesn't make much sense
[22:28:55] <elvis4526> Why then when I enter the url directly in chrome, it doesn't complain about Allow Origin headers ?
[22:29:04] <elvis4526> Isn't a ajax get call the same thing ?
[22:29:05] <jphase> elvis4526: because the origin is their domain
[22:29:25] <jphase> (the URL bar has their domain as opposed to.... whatever domain your jQuery is running on)
[22:30:31] <elvis4526> I don't understand. How can the URL bar have their domain when I entered the correct URL manually, more then my ajax call
[22:30:36] <jphase> normally a sysadmin that isn't a tard will make an internal API like that only accessible via localhost and the browser wouldn't be able to hit it at all
[22:30:45] <elvis4526> I make the get request against the SAME URL
[22:30:51] <jphase> elvis4526: so, if you go to google.com
[22:31:02] <elvis4526> yes
[22:31:04] <jphase> and they use server variables to get the remote address
[22:31:13] <jphase> $_SERVER variables in php for example
[22:31:17] <jphase> that will have google.com in it
[22:31:26] <jphase> if you have a script that runs on jsfiddle.net
[22:31:41] <jphase> it will remotely access their site, and thus the $_SERVER variables will have jsfiddle.net in there
[22:32:07] <jphase> they're allowing API access from their own origin and not remotely so you can't automate a 3rd party solution
[22:32:41] <elvis4526> Okay, I understand.
[22:32:42] <jphase> but, use corsproxy.com and penalize that silly admin :)
[22:34:58] <Vivekananda> hi everyone.
[22:35:35] <jphase> hola
[22:35:51] <Vivekananda> hey jphase.  I wanted to know how to break data into multiple pages during retrieval. Currently my xhr requests a json for an entire sql query
[22:37:10] <jphase> Vivekananda: is your json multiple rows from SQL?
[22:37:41] <Vivekananda> my json returns lots of rows and columns
[22:38:03] <Vivekananda> but code formats it to json objects in key value pairs and I get those returned
[22:38:57] <jphase> Vivekananda: sorta hard to give you an answer without seeing the data you're working with. just .each through your data and build it as you need?
[22:40:57] <Vivekananda> jphase: that is not an issue. my code already works fine. The issue is kind of like this --
[22:41:18] <Vivekananda> so I am populating a div called 'fruits' with fruits in database.  Currently database has 10000 fruits and  when I do my request ,  ALL those fruits are returned and then  ul , li    are created to show them on the div. This takes quite a bit time. I want to do it in a way so the div displays like 10 fruits and then you can    scroll/change page/ do something    to get more to view
[22:42:46] <jphase> oh, right
[22:42:56] <jphase> infinite ajax loading type deal
[22:43:20] <abishek> could somebody advice on how to show intervals on a jquery slider?
[22:44:40] <jphase> Vivekananda: so you'll need to build your query on the server to support pagination and results per page (both params of the LIMIT command in MySQL) and then you'll need to load each page accordingly. If it's based on scroll, you'll need to use jQuery to determine which page you're on based on the scroll position.
[22:45:40] <Vivekananda> jphase: so you mean there is no simple way ? like an ajax request that only takes like 1/5th of the json each time and keeps a counter or someting ?
[22:46:04] <jphase> Vivekananda: I mean, you can load the entire result set and store it into a variable, sure
[22:46:27] <jphase> most people only load what they look at with those types of requests
[22:47:19] <jphase> Vivekananda: but yeah, if you wanted to just do one ajax request and store the result in a variable that you can use later on in the scroll event, then it's a matter of simple math really
[22:50:02] <jphase> abishek: a google search shows me things like this: http://www.benknowscode.com/2013/01/adding-labelstick-marks-to-jquery-ui_4184.html
[22:51:00] <Vivekananda> jphase: I know but this entire process -  1 get 200 rows json  2. make them into 'li' elements in a ul  3. Show the results to the user is taking quite a bit of time just for 200 results
[22:51:43] <Vivekananda> I am trying to make this faster. I am guessing the db search and load time cannot be changed but then I can redue the no of 'li' elements created so the initial results show up faster
[22:52:46] <jphase> Vivekananda: well you need to determine if what's taking the time is the 200 rows of data from SQL or the building of the list items. usually it's much quicker to limit your results on the server side, but if it's not that bad to just load the top 10 of the 200 and build those list items first, then you can always just build the list items 10 at a time based on what "page" their on - which you'd determine from something li
[22:52:46] <jphase> ke scroll position
[22:53:43] <jphase> the quickest solution is definitely to limit the results in SQL, that's why all these infinite ajax loading sites do it all the same way
[22:53:56] <jphase> especially as results get > 200
[22:54:45] <Vivekananda> jphase: what is the way ?
[22:55:00] <Vivekananda> also please look at the page to see what I am talking about --
[22:55:21] <jphase> to page a page and results per page param in your ajax call that you then put in your LIMIT in SQL
[22:55:36] <Vivekananda> www.safeview.com ( go to search , enter three letters eg app and choose a 'PRODUCT' and not a vendor and click search)
[22:55:36] <jphase> then load more ajax results as you scroll (as needed)
[22:56:35] <Vivekananda> jphase: if only I could see a working exaample of this especially about how to get the 'next' 20 results and not a repeated results from db  when using the limit
[22:57:59] <jphase> it's pretty easy really, SQL allows you to do something like "LIMIT 1, 30"  which means "show me 30 results starting at ID 1"
[22:58:23] <jphase> so page 3 would be "LIMIT 90, 30"
[22:58:43] <jphase> or LIMIT (page # * results per page), (results per page)
[22:59:28] <Vivekananda> jphase: but how would sql know the order when there was none specified ?
[22:59:43] <Vivekananda> ie it can simply show me the same results right ?
[22:59:56] <jphase> the order in SQL by default is the ID/primary key
[23:00:06] <Vivekananda> ie in first search 1 -  30
[23:00:15] <Vivekananda> hmm okay so tell me
[23:00:46] <Vivekananda> if I choose two columns for my result and none are pk then how does order get determined ?
[23:01:18] <jphase> pk?
[23:01:20] <Vivekananda> also how do I tell ajax to request NExt 30 ie where is the counter being stored
[23:01:26] <Vivekananda> primary key
[23:01:54] <jphase> the primary key is still the default order, even if you only select 2 columns that both are not that eky
[23:01:56] <jphase> key*
[23:02:18] <jphase> and in ajax, you just pass 2 params:  page #, and results per page
[23:02:41] <jphase> on the server side, you build your query as I mentioned before...  LIMIT (page # * results per page), (results per page)
[23:11:08] <Vivekananda> jphase: think I got most of it . but how does the server side know which section is currently being requested  ie whether it is  20 - 30 or 30 - 40 ?
[23:11:22] <Vivekananda> I guess the ajax sends it but then how does the ajax know it ?
[23:11:55] <Vivekananda> unless of course there are 'page numbers' on the displayed div itself and each number corresponds to a different ajax request ?
[23:12:18] <jphase> Vivekananda: you'd have to determine that based on whatever UI snafu you end up with - best to get your styles in order for that
[23:12:58] <jphase> i.e., you can grab the height of 10 items in your list, add them together, and check if the scroll position is >= that height
[23:13:30] <jphase> or you can have a button that's like "load more", up to your UI preferences entirely
[23:15:14] <Vivekananda> yes load more seems the best way
[23:15:37] <Vivekananda> but load more button should have a way of storing page number info somewhere
[23:15:49] <Vivekananda> wonder how to achieve that
[23:16:45] <jphase> all you need to store is results per page
[23:16:56] <jphase> then count how many items there are with .length and divide by that number :)
[23:17:53] <Vivekananda> jphase: I can easily do it better by fixing 10 results or lower per page and having a overscroll bar there
[23:18:01] <Vivekananda> and load next 10
[23:18:29] <Vivekananda> but my problem is that the storing of current page should get triggered somehow into a global variable on the jquery page
[23:18:36] <Vivekananda> I am wondering how to do this
[23:18:58] <jphase> it doesn't really need to, no
[23:19:03] <jphase> cause you're just appending elements
[23:19:26] <jphase> so the amount of elements / how many show up per page = the page number
[23:32:07] <Vivekananda> oo ok that ! . I thought I would do like  show 1 to 10 then show 11 to 20 or something
[23:32:15] <Vivekananda> or infinite scroll or something
[23:36:47] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone here with experience with typeahead?
[23:36:55] <Vivekananda> a different question . in this link  what can I use instead of  'closest'  so that I have collapse button and corresponding collapsible row
[23:36:56] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/68RXP/1551/
[23:37:06] <Vivekananda> fRAiLtY-: I recently did one
[23:37:39] <Vivekananda> not much experience but there are lovely jquery sample autocomplete snippets to choose from
[23:38:04] <fRAiLtY-> Vivekananda: Am I right in thinking this is JSON objects? http://pastie.org/9198109
[23:38:17] <fRAiLtY-> And I need to do some additional parsing in my js to get typeahead to read them
[23:38:26] <fRAiLtY-> So newb with JS :(
[23:38:27] <Vivekananda> yes quite right
[23:38:37] <Vivekananda> no worries I am new too
[23:38:39] <Vivekananda> :)
[23:39:06] <fRAiLtY-> Is there an example on the typeahead.js site that replicates what I’m trying to do? with JSON objects?
[23:40:56] <Vivekananda> it is kind of a nested json object. You might find this link helpful when later you wish to traverse this object ---  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8085004/iterate-through-nested-javascript-objects
[23:41:21] <Vivekananda> fRAiLtY-: yep I used one . Though it is a trifle complicated
[23:41:29] <fRAiLtY-> :/
[23:41:37] <fRAiLtY-> Can you point me in the direction of the one you used?
[23:42:31] <Vivekananda> fRAiLtY-: here is the main site  http://jqueryui.com/
[23:42:39] <Vivekananda> and it has autocomplete in there
[23:42:45] <jphase> Vivekananda: on your earlier question, it really depends on the markup
[23:42:51] <Vivekananda> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[23:43:28] <fRAiLtY-> ty Vivekananda
[23:43:32] <Vivekananda> np
[23:44:18] <Vivekananda> jphase: you are talking about the closest thing right ?  for that I have one button for each expansion and want to know how to do it
[23:44:48] <morfin> oh
[23:45:12] <jphase> Vivekananda: need to see the markup otherwise I'd just be guessing
[23:56:52] <Vivekananda> jphase: I showed it ---  http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/68RXP/1551/
[23:58:08] <jphase> if that's the exact markup you are using, then .closest is fine there, what are you trying to do again?
