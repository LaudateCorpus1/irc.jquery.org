[08:57:01] <jll94> can jquery make css compatible for all browsers?
[11:05:12] <Obsdark> Hello good people, i'm trying to see how to do something like the thing placed inside the red circle, like, how to put an object in such a location what do you guys recommmend? here is the image https://imgur.com/a/4OuEWGP
[11:05:50] <Obsdark> i check some options, but i'm still not convinced
[11:07:11] <Obsdark> i ask this to know if there are more options and see if apply, was thinking on insertBefore or before, but still, also thinking in other options in javascript, and not certain what to choose
[11:14:21] <Waldkauz> Obsdark: What exacty is the question here, how to add elements dynamically, how to position them at a cetain place, ...?
[11:15:13] <Obsdark> what functions or method you'll use to place an image like that with the 4 over another image like the one under it
[11:15:22] <Obsdark> or something than generate that effect
[11:15:32] <Obsdark> looking for opinions about it
[11:19:16] <Waldkauz> For the element itself you would create a div or span with the image as background plus the text as content. Positioning then can be done with absolute left/top values
[11:19:56] <Waldkauz> Seems more like a CSS problem to me, the insertion of the element is a one-liner in JS/jQuery
[11:20:19] <Waldkauz> Or you can even place the element in your HTML code and just hide it until needed
[11:47:00] <phatcat> hello, is it possible to submit an another post request on success?
[11:47:08] <phatcat> or perhaps submit two post requests at once?
[11:52:03] <Obsdark> thanks waldkauz, i will check that aproach
[13:24:19] <admin123> what's the doc about jquery callbacks on newly inserted dom elements?
[13:30:22] <admin123> nvm https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:24:21] <Wafficus> Hi there, I have a question regarding JQuery with an AJAX request
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> go on :)
[14:25:08] <Wafficus> in my site example, I'm trying to utilize JQuery's .load() function to load in a separate webpage into an HTML of a page, but only make it appear in the related Div tag https://musimatic.net/FakeWebsites/PageCeption/loadingHTMLIntoAPageWithJQuery.html
[14:25:21] <Wafficus> the problem is that there's no error but it doesn't seem to be working as intended
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> can you share the snippet you're using?
[14:25:52] <robertmaxrees> so we don't have to go digging for it :)
[14:26:46] <Wafficus> sure thing
[14:26:48] <Wafficus> one sec
[14:27:54] <Wafficus> here's the "loadingHTMLIntoAPageWithJQuery.html": https://termbin.com/nq7or
[14:28:13] <Wafficus> here's the "load_html_with_jquery.js" script: https://termbin.com/rbwz
[14:28:52] <Wafficus> when I click any of the intended "Click here" links, the function fires as indicated by the console.log() action I put in there, but doesn't seem to be loading the page
[14:29:20] <Wafficus> If it helps, I also tried to make sure that JQuery was loaded before the Bootstrap specific JQuery variant right below it within the related <script> tags before the </body> tag on the page
[14:29:29] <robertmaxrees> (fyi it's jQuery ;)
[14:29:32] <robertmaxrees> looking.
[14:29:46] <robertmaxrees> $("#load_html_with_jquery_content").length === 0.
[14:29:49] <robertmaxrees> there's your issue.
[14:30:45] <robertmaxrees> oh, because you're doing  $("#load_html_with_jquery_content").remove();
[14:31:09] <robertmaxrees> you're removing the element and then trying to append to it - you want .empty() or .html('');
[14:32:42] <Wafficus> oh sorry about the naming
[14:32:46] <robertmaxrees> Wafficus
[14:32:49] <Wafficus> ah gotcha will try that
[14:32:57] <Wafficus> thanks for the headsup on that
[14:35:28] <robertmaxrees> Wafficus also: it's kind of a no-no to shotgun questions out to multiple channels.
[14:35:38] <Wafficus> robertmaxrees: gotcha, sorry about that
[14:36:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:36:09] <Wafficus> understood though
[14:36:22] <Wafficus> my issue was more jQuery based so hence why I should have just posted here
[14:36:42] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.  just a little etiquette consideration for the future :)
[14:38:57] <Wafficus> understood
[14:44:17] <Wafficus> robertmaxrees: I changed that related line to: https://termbin.com/nq7or
[14:44:22] <Wafficus> whoops sorry
[14:44:56] <Wafficus> I changed that line to: $("#load_html_with_jquery_content").load(url + " #load_html_with_jquery_content")
[14:45:03] <Wafficus> still same result on the page though
[14:45:15] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said :)
[14:45:20] <robertmaxrees> already addressed the core issue.
[14:45:28] <robertmaxrees> your load statement is find.
[14:45:29] <robertmaxrees> *fine
[14:45:30] <Wafficus> I also removed that statement
[14:45:37] <Wafficus> the .remove() line above it
[14:45:41] <Wafficus> forgot to add that point
[14:45:49] <robertmaxrees> oh.  let me look at the page again.
[14:47:46] <robertmaxrees> why did you change the .load??
[14:48:00] <robertmaxrees> the selector you pass as part of that arg needs to be on the page you're loading.
[14:48:06] <robertmaxrees> load_html_with_jquery_content is not in the page you're loading.
[14:49:18] <Wafficus> I thought you could load an .html file within the same directory
[14:49:24] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:49:25] <Wafficus> aka the intended url
[14:49:57] <robertmaxrees> so the way it works is $('selector for where to put stuff on the current page').load('theUrlOfTheOtherPage #someSelectorForContentOnTheOtherPage')
[14:50:57] <Wafficus> ah
[14:51:08] <Wafficus> so the "#someSelectorForContentOnTheOtherPage" section isn't needed right?
[14:51:14] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:51:14] <Wafficus> if I intended on loading just the .html of the other page?
[14:51:19] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[14:51:28] <Wafficus> sorry if this is confusing
[14:51:37] <Wafficus> I'm just trying to adapt the related example from the JS book I've been learning from
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> you either want to load a fragment, or make sure the other page is just an html fragment.
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> so if you don't pass a selector, then you need to make sure the other page doesn't have a doctype, html, body, script tags.
[14:52:12] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[14:52:18] <robertmaxrees> just a snippet of markup.
[14:53:16] <Wafficus> I see, so could I get past this by possibly
[14:53:26] <Wafficus> putting a selector in the <body> tag of the other page lol?
[14:53:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:53:32] <Wafficus> dang
[14:53:49] <robertmaxrees> because then you'll have a body tag in a body tag, which is invalid.
[14:53:58] <robertmaxrees> is this just for a PoC?
[14:54:11] <robertmaxrees> or are you planning on building something bigger
[14:54:23] <Wafficus> not building anything
[14:54:27] <Wafficus> purely learning from the book honestly
[14:55:08] <robertmaxrees> then just give that .load() an id or something for part of that other page.
[14:58:34] <Wafficus> gotcha will do
[14:58:38] <Wafficus> thanks a ton for that
[22:18:43] <robertmaxrees> "be triggered"?
[22:19:27] <robertmaxrees> Starship808 $('#main').on('click', '.close', function(e){ ?
[22:20:03] <Starship808> i want to keep $('html').on('click' ...
[22:20:12] <robertmaxrees> why 'html'?
[22:20:25] <Starship808> could be body too, because of ajax content
[22:20:30] <Starship808> i am thinking something like $('html').on('click', 'div[class="menu-wrapper"] > span[class="close"]', function(e)
[22:20:32] <robertmaxrees> are you replacing the entire contents of the body??
[22:20:39] <Starship808> so only close inside menu-wrapper is observed
[22:20:47] <robertmaxrees> and don't use attribute selectors like that.
[22:20:49] <robertmaxrees> use normal class selectors.
[22:21:12] <robertmaxrees> so $('body').on('click', '#main .close', function(e){ ?
[22:21:22] <Starship808> alright :)
[22:21:22] <Starship808> ty
[22:21:24] <robertmaxrees> don't prepend with the tag name if you can help it.
[22:21:32] <Starship808> awesome
[22:21:48] <robertmaxrees> :) otherwise, just a normal css selector.
[22:24:53] <kof> robertmaxrees hai
[22:25:05] <robertmaxrees> hello
[22:25:20] <kof> I am trying to load jquery by appenchild then call the slider
[22:25:24] <kof> https://coderblaze.com/jstest/
[22:25:32] <kof> view-source:https://coderblaze.com/jstest/
[22:25:36] <robertmaxrees> sigh
[22:25:47] <robertmaxrees> why?
[22:25:54] <robertmaxrees> just load jquery normally.
[22:25:57] <robertmaxrees> !next
[22:26:13] <kof> Will this work?
[22:26:20] <robertmaxrees> not like that.
[22:26:29] <robertmaxrees> it's a bad idea.  just load it like normal.  no reason not to.
[22:27:00] <kof> Actually i am trying to build a caching app where js will load like that
[22:27:28] <robertmaxrees> why?
[22:28:12] <kof> I have an array of js files
[22:28:20] <robertmaxrees> and?
[22:28:31] <kof> then iterate them and load
[22:28:44] <robertmaxrees> not to be a jerk but there are a ton of preexisting ways to dynamically load JS files.
[22:28:51] <robertmaxrees> use one of those and call it a day.
[22:29:02] <robertmaxrees> though, tbh, they're overkill for a lot of cases.
[22:29:49] <kof> another q how to load a js file with delay?
[22:29:57] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[22:30:18] <robertmaxrees> not trying to be difficult, that's a really strange thing to want to build.
[22:31:06] <kof> I want to delay less priority files
[22:31:10] <kof> and improve speed
[22:31:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[22:31:33] <robertmaxrees> you have a ton of other baked-in features in browsers that let you do exactly that.
[22:31:47] <kof> I have checked a caching php plugin thats how its done
[22:31:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad plugin.
[22:32:00] <kof> lol
[22:32:45] <robertmaxrees> use something that loads files on an as-needed basis and makes use of deferred/async/etc.
[22:33:58] <kof> I know deffered, aynch will work but i want to learn this way too
[22:34:08] <kof> asynch*
[22:34:13] <robertmaxrees> *async
[22:34:19] <robertmaxrees> and the way you're trying to do it literally doesn't make sense.
[22:34:45] <kof> actually i am talking about a plugin how it works :)
[22:34:53] <robertmaxrees> don't use that plugin.
[22:34:55] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[22:35:04] <robertmaxrees> manually delaying script loading makes absolutely no sense.
[22:36:51] <robertmaxrees> in fact, that could actually be very detrimental to your site performance.
[22:40:07] <kof> That would be too
[22:40:16] <kof> I will try the safe one
[22:40:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[22:41:23] <robertmaxrees> check out something like webpack fwiw.
[22:47:11] <kof> thanks
