[05:12:11] <Juslintek> Hi, how to create multiple instances of plugin per container and uid? lets say on instantiation in methods object i create new array of items, then I put this to window.myPlugin = this; but this only saves the state of this object as well I need to save dom state inside the container of the plugin is working with, what is the best way to do it? create some on('myPluginChange', function(){ const key = this.items.push(item); this.items[key].html = item?
[05:12:11] <Juslintek> }); and then on each method I trigger this even on where the item is rendered?
[06:03:41] <FilipNortic> mrjq: checked the regex their currently using on github and what you are corrent. Don't know if they have reasons for it though
[06:04:36] <FilipNortic> Never really liked validate there codestrucure is evil and the documentation is confusing to me
[07:22:38] <Ice_Strike> Hi
[07:23:24] <kitoy> hello, was wondering if i put the right link of this to call my js script
[07:23:25] <kitoy> https://pastebin.com/eDA3h2nF
[07:26:25] <Uhkis> kitoy: if your js file has jquery in it, you need to include jquery first. so swap lines 16 & 17
[07:29:22] <kitoy> ok, was wondering why this does'nt work yet
[07:29:28] <kitoy> here is the js file
[07:29:29] <kitoy> https://pastebin.com/akG8EANU
[07:30:03] <kitoy> here is the css
[07:30:04] <kitoy> https://pastebin.com/TGZBTPXt
[07:30:48] <Ice_Strike> Can you see anything wrong with that?
[07:30:49] <Ice_Strike> url: '/products/suppliers/contact/' + inputContactId + (formMode == 'edit')? '/edit' : '',
[08:46:53] <mrjq> If div has Class then ADD -->  window.onbeforeunload = function() { return "You have unsaved changes."; }
[08:47:01] <mrjq> how do I do that?
[08:48:05] <Woet> mrjq: do you know how to check whether a div has a class?
[08:49:07] <mrjq> Woet: if ($('#form.active')) { 	window.onbeforeunload = function() { return "You have unsaved changes."; }; }
[08:50:00] <mrjq> Woet: https://jsfiddle.net/cp266059/1/
[08:50:20] <Woet> mrjq: works fine here, https://jsfiddle.net/cp266059/2/
[08:50:21] <mrjq> if you reload page (f5) it should not ask now
[08:50:35] <Woet> there is no active class..
[08:50:37] <mrjq> only if div has class = active
[08:50:44] <Woet> yes
[08:50:51] <Woet> which is what your code is meant to do..?
[08:53:24] <mrjq> Woet: If my div hasClass 'active' then activate  --->	window.onbeforeunload = function() { return "You have unsaved changes."; };
[08:53:33] <Woet> mrjq: thats what the code does...
[08:53:37] <FilipNortic> mrjq:  well if you wanna check if the div is activce at unload this isn't the right way that code checks if it has the active class on load and adds a unload handler in that case
[08:54:29] <mrjq> if you press f5 you get an alertbox, you should only get that if u have class active
[08:54:43] <Woet> mrjq: https://jsfiddle.net/cp266059/1/ - theres no alert box, theres no active class
[08:54:54] <Woet> mrjq: https://jsfiddle.net/cp266059/2/ - there is an alert box, there is an active class
[08:55:03] <Woet> mrjq: what could possibly be confusing you?
[08:55:32] <mrjq> Woet: remove the class 'active' from html and it should not do an alertbox
[08:56:26] <Woet> mrjq: okay, i see. thats because if ($('#form.active')) { is not a proper way to check whether it has a class.
[08:56:35] <Woet> mrjq: https://api.jquery.com/hasclass/
[08:57:20] <mrjq> https://jsfiddle.net/cp266059/12/
[08:57:41] <mrjq> that worked =)
[08:57:47] <mrjq> thx

[10:20:54] <morfin> hello
[10:26:07] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/nkrjzvwp/ how to remove all the .has-error class in the #modalAddEditContact?
[10:28:29] <FilipNortic> Ice_Strike: on takes ('event', 'selector',function()
[10:31:10] <Ice_Strike> $('.has-error',this).removeClass(); seem to work
[10:31:25] <FilipNortic> i does
[10:31:28] <FilipNortic> it*
[10:31:46] <FilipNortic> the on stuff is wrong however
[10:34:37] <FilipNortic> Ice_Strike: $('#modalAddEditContact').removeClass('has-error'); should work to
[10:34:47] <FilipNortic> if it doesn't something else is wrong
[10:36:29] <Ice_Strike> how to remove <span class="error-help-block"> ? remove the span tag
[10:37:09] <Ice_Strike> I have tried $('.error-help-block',thisModal).remove();
[10:39:14] <FilipNortic> Ice_Strike: well it dependes on where the span is in relation to thisModal
[10:39:27] <Ice_Strike> There are multiple span
[10:40:11] <Ice_Strike> <div id="modalAddEditContact> <span class="error-help-block"> </span> <span class="error-help-block"> </span>  </div>
[10:40:13] <Ice_Strike> like that
[10:40:21] <FilipNortic> if it's a direct child thisModal.children("span.error-help-block').remove()
[10:40:50] <FilipNortic> that will remove all
[10:42:10] <FilipNortic> if you just want to remove the first then$("#modalAddEditContact").children("span.error-help-block').eq(0).remove()
[10:42:26] <FilipNortic> will remove juste the first one
[10:43:29] <Ice_Strike> I want to remove all :)
[10:43:33] <Ice_Strike> However, that didnt work.
[10:44:21] <Ice_Strike> I got it to work
[10:44:30] <Ice_Strike> thisModal.find("span.error-help-block').remove()
[10:45:08] <FilipNortic> well then they're not direct children there are atleast 2 levels away
[10:45:15] <Ice_Strike> :)
[10:45:55] <FilipNortic> find will return all the decendents that matches the selector
[10:46:17] <FilipNortic> .children will only take the direct decendaants that matches
[10:47:42] <Ice_Strike> Thanks for help
[11:10:37] <Ice_Strike> Any idea why this wont work
[11:10:37] <Ice_Strike> $('select[name="title"] option[value="' + j.title + '"]').prop('selected', true);
[11:37:43] <Ice_Strike> Any idea why this wont work
[11:37:44] <Ice_Strike> $('select[name="title"] option[value="' + j.title + '"]').prop('selected', true);
[11:39:36] <Uhkis> Ice_Strike: how about $('select[name="title"]').val(j.title); instead?
[11:40:22] <Ice_Strike> It need to select it?
[11:40:33] <Ice_Strike> .val for setting the value
[11:44:27] <Uhkis> you're trying to get an option selected that has value of j.title, right?
[11:45:01] <Ice_Strike> yes
[11:45:15] <Uhkis> Ice_Strike: so val() will work just fine
[11:46:52] <Ice_Strike> Hmm I see
[11:46:54] <Ice_Strike> Let me try
[11:54:12] <Ice_Strike> That work, thanks.

[12:26:50] <cluelessperson> hey guys, I'd like to create a function that'll allow the user to select through a file tree
[12:55:42] <GanzAndere> Hi, I'm having difficulty parsing a json file in jquery, not even sure how
[12:55:47] <GanzAndere> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[12:55:56] <robertmaxrees> show your code maybe?
[12:56:16] <GanzAndere> I can get the file
[12:56:20] <GanzAndere> I just don' tknow how to parse for the reposne
[12:56:22] <GanzAndere> I'm new to this
[12:56:22] <GanzAndere> :)
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> show the response, too :)
[12:56:37] <GanzAndere> ok
[12:59:03] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, https://paste2.org/NhU0002F
[12:59:12] <GanzAndere> This is the file I want to parse
[12:59:52] <robertmaxrees> so what happens if you do https://bpaste.net/show/f7d2c1779252 ?
[13:00:11] <GanzAndere> Oh
[13:00:12] <GanzAndere> console.log
[13:00:14] <robertmaxrees> even better - https://bpaste.net/show/e4cbfde4d095
[13:00:20] <robertmaxrees> and console.log() just shows you stuff.
[13:00:20] <GanzAndere> I ried alert(datA)
[13:00:23] <GanzAndere> i see.
[13:00:24] <GanzAndere> hang on
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't use alerts for stuff like this :)
[13:00:44] <GanzAndere> BTW,, where should I be typing this
[13:00:50] <GanzAndere> I am using the browser chrome console section
[13:00:55] <GanzAndere> I figure I can test js in here
[13:01:04] <GanzAndere> is jquery always there?
[13:01:14] <GanzAndere> I wonder if jquery is loaded in brower console?
[13:01:17] <GanzAndere> I'm confused.
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> it's not.
[13:01:27] <GanzAndere> I see
[13:01:28] <robertmaxrees> jquery has to be loaded separately.
[13:02:26] <GanzAndere> what if a page I olpe who has jquery in it?
[13:02:28] <GanzAndere> would that console work?
[13:02:33] <GanzAndere> page I open*
[13:02:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:03:08] <GanzAndere> I see how this works
[13:03:13] <GanzAndere> Interesting
[13:03:19] <GanzAndere> so data is an object?
[13:03:27] <robertmaxrees> did that second console log work
[13:03:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:03:31] <GanzAndere> yes
[13:03:35] <robertmaxrees> then yep.
[13:03:39] <GanzAndere> I see how you're accessing its thingies
[13:03:42] <GanzAndere> with a dot.
[13:03:44] <robertmaxrees> properties heh
[13:03:51] <GanzAndere> :D
[13:04:04] <GanzAndere> object properties/members
[13:04:10] <robertmaxrees> in js they're properties.
[13:04:18] <GanzAndere> So now
[13:04:46] <GanzAndere> I must loop over icestats.source
[13:04:54] <GanzAndere> You access deeper ones like with a dot or another array notaiton?
[13:05:01] <GanzAndere> I am new to js too, I suck at life.
[13:05:23] <robertmaxrees> that's just an array.
[13:05:53] <robertmaxrees> you can do data.icestats.source.forEach(function(currentSource) { console.log(currentSource) });
[13:06:05] <GanzAndere> you can foreach with a . on a property?
[13:06:10] <GanzAndere> that's a cool lingo.
[13:06:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> it's a method.
[13:07:30] <GanzAndere> https://dev.psychedelicsdaily.com/radio/ I am trying to display the meta data for each station I have over here
[13:07:44] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[13:08:10] <GanzAndere> I couldn't find anyway to get icecast 2 stream and parse the stream, and only prase for the metadata being sent every few bytes, to keep the radio update w/ what is being played
[13:08:21] <GanzAndere> So I have to rely on this method, to parse the icecast server stats json file
[13:08:44] <GanzAndere> Now to display this in each radio, I'm not sure how I could go about it.
[13:08:54] <robertmaxrees> you could append elements.
[13:08:56] <GanzAndere> There is no way for the client to know when the server has changed mp3
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:09:08] <GanzAndere> So when the backend server changes music, I need to also display on client
[13:09:20] <GanzAndere> I was thinking every so often parsing the json file
[13:09:26] <GanzAndere> I can't think of a decent solution to this
[13:09:26] <robertmaxrees> you could do that.
[13:09:27] <GanzAndere> ideas?
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> your methodology is sound.  unless you want to get in to using something like sockets or some kind of server push
[13:11:20] <GanzAndere> Well, the best thing would be this:
[13:12:34] <GanzAndere> Get the actual stream in browser using Js. Then parse the stream headers to see where the Ice-int value is, to see at which byte the metadata is sent. Then start at that byte, get the metadata and use that to keep the song title updates, and use the audio data and queue it up in chunks and shchedule it so it plays properly
[13:12:38] <GanzAndere> now that's a lot more involved.
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> that wouldn't be how you'd do that.
[13:12:50] <GanzAndere> oh?
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:13:09] <GanzAndere> tyt, sir, thanks.
[13:16:18] <robertmaxrees> sorry had to step away for a second.
[13:16:53] <robertmaxrees> but you don't want to build out something to parse an icecast stream just to grab some metadata.  just use a recursive timeout call that updates every like 10 seconds or so and call it a day.
[13:17:03] <GanzAndere> yeah.
[13:17:07] <GanzAndere> That's soudn much simpler.
[13:17:16] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't need to be up to the moment accurate.
[13:17:22] <GanzAndere> Also, not sure how I should update the thing
[13:17:25] <GanzAndere> you're right
[13:17:38] <robertmaxrees> in the success handler of the ajax call...
[13:18:21] <GanzAndere> I see. I'm trying to piece it all together.
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost?
[13:21:39] <GanzAndere> Well. I have three streams. Currently they are rendered to html in a static site gen called Hugo, in markdown: https://paste2.org/0f8HWg4j
[13:21:48] <GanzAndere> The Hugo shortcode fo generating the radio is there as well.
[13:22:05] <GanzAndere> I'm trying to figure out how to keep the song titles updates for each radio
[13:22:15] <GanzAndere> The steps/algorithm i need to take
[13:22:22] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost?
[13:22:40] <GanzAndere> this step
[13:22:43] <robertmaxrees> you're making a lot of "i need to figure out x" statements but not sayinbg "how do I do y"?
[13:23:08] <GanzAndere> I'm thinking how to generate the radio box with the json feed or should I ... i hav eno idea how to update the song title.
[13:23:11] <GanzAndere> (sigh)
[13:23:23] <robertmaxrees> you can target the element and use .text()
[13:23:28] <GanzAndere> oh
[13:23:35] <GanzAndere> Interesting
[13:23:57] <robertmaxrees> do you have any familiarity with basic jquery?
[13:24:07] <GanzAndere> so while I pass the css class of the radio in my shortcode, html is generated w/ that class. I can target that and put a text element inside it and update it.
[13:24:08] <GanzAndere> right?
[13:24:10] <GanzAndere> no sir.
[13:24:16] <GanzAndere> I'm new to front end.
[13:24:16] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[13:24:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to give this a whirl then.
[13:24:24] <GanzAndere> absolutely
[13:24:31] <GanzAndere> great, thanks, that should help
[13:24:43] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[13:25:25] <morfin> does jQuery cache selectors?
[13:25:43] <robertmaxrees> morfin hrm?
[13:26:03] <morfin> i guess not then stuff like name*=something is very slow
[13:26:11] <morfin> every time
[13:26:16] <GanzAndere> How would I set the parsed song titles to those css classes?. In the foreach, in console.log it just dumps them all
[13:26:27] <GanzAndere> console.log(data.icestats.source.forEach(function(currentSource) { console.log(currentSource.title) }));
[13:26:41] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere link to the data again?
[13:26:44] <Woet> why are you doing a foreach inside console.log?
[13:26:44] <GanzAndere> not sure how to target my css selectors
[13:26:46] <robertmaxrees> morfin "very slow" is relative
[13:27:01] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere also, yeah no console log on the outside there.
[13:27:04] <robertmaxrees> (data.icestats.source.forEach(function(currentSource) {
[13:27:04] <robertmaxrees> console.log(currentSource.title) })
[13:27:06] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:27:13] <robertmaxrees> ditch the opening paren.
[13:27:25] <morfin> well, what about nested complicated selectors?
[13:27:27] <GanzAndere> no it works. just thinking
[13:27:33] <robertmaxrees> morfin like what?
[13:27:41] <robertmaxrees> morfin what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[13:27:42] <GanzAndere> https://paste2.org/NhU0002F
[13:27:48] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, data ^
[13:28:07] <GanzAndere> There are three arrays in source, not titled w/ a key, only index
[13:28:09] <GanzAndere> 0,1,2
[13:28:18] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere nope.
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> three objects in source.
[13:28:25] <GanzAndere> ahg
[13:28:28] <GanzAndere> right, 3 objects
[13:28:29] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere so data.icestats.source.forEach(function(currentSource) { console.log(currentSource.title) });
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> you do your work in that foreach.
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> brb
[13:29:10] <GanzAndere> Sure. Just trying to figure out how to assign each of the title values to the correct radio css selector
[13:33:48] <morfin> interseting does browser store special hashmap where it has references to DOM nodes
[13:33:55] <morfin> and key is id
[13:34:24] <morfin> then finding element by id is obviously O(1)
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> morfin heh.
[13:37:07] <robertmaxrees> morfin so, what's spurring these questions?
[13:38:00] <GanzAndere> what is the function in jquery to replace the contents of an element?
[13:38:23] <morfin> well, about name*=thing is curiosity also today guy used that in loop which could be not pretty nice
[13:38:45] <morfin> GanzAndere, html()
[13:38:49] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere if you read the learner center, you'll see http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/manipulating-elements/
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> morfin depends on how you're using it.
[13:39:27] <robertmaxrees> morfin read http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/ for some quick info.
[13:39:29] <GanzAndere> ok I'll give that a go first
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> but in general, don't prematurely optimize.
[13:39:57] <morfin> not sure how often i hear that
[13:40:07] <robertmaxrees> to not prematurely optimize?
[13:40:28] <morfin> yes
[13:40:35] <robertmaxrees> it's a pretty common thing.
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> focus on writing readable code.  save for a few special cases, things like selector performance are pretty much a non-issue.
[13:43:50] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, https://bpaste.net/show/85b852e9ae3a <- works. Now to add a timer/loop like you said. How often should I check for this? to update. This would be setTimeOut function?
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> a recursive setTimeout call, yeah.
[13:44:56] <robertmaxrees> and why is that console.log() there still?
[13:45:12] <GanzAndere> testing
[13:45:15] <robertmaxrees> erm
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> wrong place to put it for testing.
[13:45:26] <GanzAndere> i kopw
[13:45:28] <GanzAndere> I jsut realied it
[13:45:28] <GanzAndere> haha
[13:45:32] <GanzAndere> You're good.
[13:45:43] <morfin> i had worse thing
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> morfin hrm?
[13:46:02] <morfin> setInterval which setInterval to setInterval ...
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:46:14] <GanzAndere> https://bpaste.net/show/739d5911081b how about this
[13:46:29] <GanzAndere> 120000 ?
[13:46:37] <GanzAndere> I don't know what would be optimal.
[13:46:45] <robertmaxrees> you're not recursively calling it.
[13:46:48] <GanzAndere> Oh.
[13:46:54] <GanzAndere> I don't follow.
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> and just do 5000 for now.
[13:46:56] <taplar_> lots of fun today it seems
[13:47:52] <GanzAndere> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5559510/javascript-recursion-settimeout
[13:47:56] <GanzAndere> i'll figure this out
[13:48:05] <morfin> function createInterval() {setInterval(createInterval, 1000); console.log("test")}
[13:48:11] <GanzAndere> ahh
[13:48:12] <GanzAndere> I see.
[13:48:20] <robertmaxrees> don't use intervals.
[13:48:22] <morfin> Get out of there it's gonna blow!
[13:48:25] <robertmaxrees> especially with ajax calls.
[13:49:04] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, not fully grasping this recursion
[13:49:11] <robertmaxrees> it'll look something like this: https://bpaste.net/show/d3a60630186d
[13:49:14] <GanzAndere> in english can you tell me what needs to happen
[13:49:22] <GanzAndere> I see
[13:49:23] <robertmaxrees> you get a freebie code snippet ;)
[13:49:35] <morfin> that leaks memory
[13:49:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:49:48] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[13:50:13] <morfin> i always use $.ajax =)
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> $.getJson uses $.ajax under the hood.
[13:50:31] <taplar_> where is the mem leak?
[13:50:31] <morfin> i know
[13:50:34] <GanzAndere> so fetchstreaminfo is a variable set to a function, who calls its thing, calls an update function. The updaet function then uses a timeout to call fetchstream again
[13:50:35] <robertmaxrees> and the dude's learning.
[13:50:37] <GanzAndere> I see the code. I kind of understnad it
[13:50:42] <GanzAndere> but I don't follow the entire logic
[13:50:43] <morfin> maybe because i find that more.. readable
[13:50:45] <GanzAndere> woul dyou mind explaining?
[13:50:54] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere you literally just explained it yourself.
[13:50:55] <morfin> my interval leaks
[13:51:07] <GanzAndere> Well, sure I can read code and sayit out loud
[13:51:18] <GanzAndere> but I don't think I udnerstand why recursion
[13:51:23] <robertmaxrees> morfin setInterval also assumes that the ajax call will complete within a certain amount of time.
[13:51:25] <GanzAndere> i think that's the quesiton.
[13:51:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not technically a recursive function.
[13:51:41] <GanzAndere> right.
[13:51:43] <taplar_> your statement seemed like you were staying roberts snipplet leaked
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> just one way to accomplish it that's a  little easier to read.
[13:51:46] <GanzAndere> it's not calling the same fuction from within itself.
[13:51:50] <GanzAndere> I see.
[13:51:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you could do it that way.
[13:51:58] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[13:52:01] <GanzAndere> right.
[13:52:04] <morfin> promises are good for async stuff
[13:52:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:52:22] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[13:52:23] <morfin> but last time i used BlueBird because vanilla was not enough
[13:52:27] <GanzAndere> Thank you mr. robert.
[13:52:31] <GanzAndere> max
[13:52:45] <GanzAndere> You are a good help
[13:52:58] <morfin> but then i looked at code and asked - what a heck is this s**t
[13:53:18] <robertmaxrees> i'm so lost.
[13:55:53] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, I get undefined
[13:55:57] <GanzAndere> no idea what is undefined
[13:56:00] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere where?
[13:56:10] <GanzAndere> in the entire snippet you gave me
[13:56:16] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[13:56:23] <GanzAndere> I made sure it was correct and it says undefined
[13:56:29] <robertmaxrees> where?
[13:56:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:56:47] <taplar_> typo in stream
[13:56:51] <robertmaxrees> oh hah
[13:56:57] <v0lksman> can anyone help me pass a kwarg to a TemplateView?  https://dpaste.de/DqSz
[13:57:01] <GanzAndere> no
[13:57:06] <GanzAndere> I corrected all the typos and spellings of variables
[13:57:10] <GanzAndere> I made sure of that.
[13:57:19] <v0lksman> been spinning my wheels so I know I'm likely approaching this incorrectly
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere show us your current code then.
[13:57:34] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman not seeing any jquery in there.
[13:57:58] <GanzAndere> https://bpaste.net/show/4335091fd401
[13:58:03] <v0lksman> robertmaxrees: why would there be jquery?
[13:58:08] <v0lksman> oh dammit
[13:58:10] <v0lksman> sorry
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:58:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:58:18] <v0lksman> shameholeIgo
[13:58:34] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere are you getting an actual error or does it just print undefined in the console when you paste it and run it?
[13:58:49] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, the latter
[13:58:54] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[13:58:56] <robertmaxrees> that's not an error.
[13:58:59] <GanzAndere> oh
[13:59:05] <GanzAndere> I thought some variable was unefind
[13:59:08] <GanzAndere> I started psellchecking
[13:59:09] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[13:59:09] <GanzAndere> lol
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> it's printing the return value of the function call.
[13:59:18] <GanzAndere> ohhh
[13:59:22] <GanzAndere> why is that undefined then
[13:59:28] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're not returning anything.
[13:59:53] <GanzAndere> why not return something?
[13:59:56] <GanzAndere> make it defined.
[14:00:00] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to.
[14:00:02] <taplar_> why should it?
[14:00:03] <GanzAndere> I have no idea if that makes snese
[14:00:06] <GanzAndere> ok
[14:00:12] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to return from every function,  it's not an error.
[14:00:19] <robertmaxrees> just the REPL trying to be helpful.
[14:00:21] <GanzAndere> oh, it's not ilke you have to return suces or fail?
[14:00:23] <GanzAndere> i see.
[14:00:27] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[14:00:39] <GanzAndere> js is weird.
[14:00:40] <GanzAndere> sorry.
[14:00:45] <GanzAndere> or maybe I'm old.
[14:00:49] <GanzAndere> probably both.
[14:00:57] <robertmaxrees> that's just the REPL
[14:01:12] <robertmaxrees> and it's just different from what you're used to.
[14:04:40] <taplar_> nothing stopping you from returning something.  the point though is what problem does that solve.  if it's not solving a problem, why do it?
[14:28:43] <harushimo> question, I'm using the $.getJSON method. I have json file in my js directory. How could I point to that file using the method?
[14:29:01] <robertmaxrees> are you running a webserver?
[14:29:25] <harushimo> no I'm not running it as webserver. the file is local
[14:29:37] <harushimo> did I misread the $.getJSON method?
[14:29:43] <robertmaxrees> you need a webserver.
[14:30:31] <harushimo> oh okay
[14:30:49] <harushimo> thank you for the clarification. I'm new to jquery. Its been a long time
[14:31:09] <harushimo> $.getJSON needs url, then you can pass the data correct? its from the documentation
[14:31:21] <GanzAndere> https://paste2.org/IIbU7MfE <- I think I got it
[14:31:28] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, thanks a bunch guy
[14:31:32] <harushimo> please correct me
[14:31:37] <robertmaxrees> harushimo "pass the data" from the code?
[14:31:43] <robertmaxrees> like, thje JSONB?
[14:31:58] <robertmaxrees> *JSON
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> GanzAndere cool
[14:33:12] <GanzAndere> Hm. works on localhost, doesn't work on server.
[14:33:14] <GanzAndere> doh.
[14:33:44] <GanzAndere> oh
[14:33:47] <GanzAndere> blocked, mixed content.
[14:33:49] <GanzAndere> *sigh*
[14:33:57] <robertmaxrees> try https instead
[14:33:58] <GanzAndere> I now have to figure out how to make my icecast server over ssl.
[14:34:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:34:07] <GanzAndere> it's using ssl port
[14:34:12] <harushimo> robertmaxtrees: Let me show you my code.
[14:34:12] <GanzAndere> configured on an assl srver
[14:34:16] <GanzAndere> just wondering why
[14:34:17] <harushimo> https://gist.github.com/harushimo/2eae069b682bd5730c0e13180091f3af
[14:34:38] <harushimo> I have a file js/locations.json. I want to point to the file and loop through it
[14:34:45] <robertmaxrees> harushimo are you trying to edit the data and send it back to the server?
[14:35:00] <robertmaxrees> because the basic idea is there, but you're doing something weird in that callback.
[14:35:25] <harushimo> I was following this tutorial
[14:35:36] <harushimo> http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/json-data.html
[14:35:37] <robertmaxrees> harushimo so what doesn't this do that you need it to?
[14:36:21] <harushimo> this shows my array as empty
[14:36:27] <robertmaxrees> where?
[14:36:44] <robertmaxrees> like, where are you printing your array back out?
[14:36:59] <harushimo> console.log statement inside my function
[14:37:10] <harushimo> it should show my data that is being passed
[14:37:19] <robertmaxrees> that's the data coming from the server.
[14:37:27] <robertmaxrees> try just console.log(data);
[14:38:01] <harushimo> i'm getting nothing and no errors messages
[14:38:07] <harushimo> I don't understand why
[14:38:10] <robertmaxrees> then your server isn't returning anything.
[14:38:53] <harushimo> i'm using a localhost. I'm using a server per se. I'm developing the application on my local workstation. Does the $.getJSON method not work that way?
[14:39:04] <harushimo> apologies for my twenty questions
[14:39:14] <robertmaxrees> harushimo you need to serve the page and the json file from the same port, protocol, and domain.
[14:39:50] <FLeiXiuS> Whats the best way to sort ['aa', 'a', 'z'] --> ['a', 'z', 'aa']
[14:40:16] <taplar_> #javascript
[14:40:18] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> * ##javascript
[14:53:29] <harushimo> Can we do this with our getJSON method: $.getJSON("../js/locations.json", function(data)?
[14:53:46] <taplar_> what do the docs say?
[14:54:18] <harushimo> docs say URL not a static file?
[14:54:53] <taplar_> if there was an image in that location could you do that for an img tag?
[14:55:14] <robertmaxrees> harushimo so long as it's a valid path, you're good.
[14:55:45] <taplar_> and you can just try and see if it works too
[14:55:53] <harushimo> i am doing it right now
[14:55:59] <harushimo> thanks for all the help
[15:30:05] <Es0teric> checking if an array has values can be done like this right: if( arr ) ?
[15:30:19] <Es0teric> i mean if( arr ) { }
[15:35:26] <persina> What's the best way to prevent a form from being submit twice?
[15:36:42] <persina> Disabling the submit button is not enough. I need to prevent scripts from submitting twice as well...
[15:53:41] <robertmaxrees> why would they be submitting twice?
[15:59:34] <Es0teric> whats wrong with this? that.closest('.bp_reactions_reactions_list').find('"[data-bp-activity-reaction-type='" + res.data.activities[0].type + "']"').addClass('reacted'); i get this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[16:00:09] <robertmaxrees> ('"[data-bp-activity-reaction-type='" + res.data.activities[0].type + "']"')
[16:00:13] <robertmaxrees> mixing up your quotes.
[16:00:41] <robertmaxrees> .find('[data-bp-activity-reaction-type=' + res.data.activities[0].type + ']')
[16:03:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well it seems that its not adding the class
[16:05:07] <persina> robertmaxrees: by mistake?
[16:07:21] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric i'd need to see what you're selecting.

[16:08:18] <robertmaxrees> html?
[16:08:22] <robertmaxrees> need some context here.
[16:09:35] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/o7x6kpd5/7/
[16:10:09] <Es0teric> each <li> has a <span> that has the data attribute
[16:10:16] <Es0teric> inside of a <a>
[16:10:20] <Es0teric> i didnt add it there but you get the idea
[16:10:34] <Es0teric> meaning each <li> in .bp_reactions_reactions_list
[16:10:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[16:10:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:10:49] <robertmaxrees> so...
[16:10:57] <robertmaxrees> i got nothing without seeing the actual HTM.
[16:11:00] <robertmaxrees> *HTML
[16:11:57] <Es0teric> =_= ok robertmaxrees i will update it
[16:14:27] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/o7x6kpd5/8/
[16:14:28] <Es0teric> there you go
[16:14:35] <Es0teric> i updated the html
[16:15:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:16:08] <taplar_> what's the issue?
[16:16:12] <harushimo> it didn't work guys
[16:16:19] <harushimo> i'm working on the bug
[16:16:53] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle works Es0teric soo (shrug)
[16:21:25] <Es0teric> why is it not working for me then
[16:21:42] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees you mean the adding the class right?
[16:21:59] <taplar_> does that fiddle not work for you?
[16:22:45] <Es0teric> taplar_ i am trying to do this: https://pastebin.com/MDfK0hzi but i am using the html in the fiddle as a reference
[16:22:47] <Es0teric> for you guys
[16:23:09] <taplar_> not really an answer to the question
[16:24:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:25:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees idk why it doesnt work as expected for me though
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> what isn't that fiddle doing?
[16:27:48] <Es0teric> what i expect it to
[16:28:10] <taplar_> lol
[16:28:22] <taplar_> dude, that's vague as shit
[16:28:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> give us more to work with.
[16:28:36] <robertmaxrees> when i click a line, a group expand.
[16:28:39] <robertmaxrees> *expands
[16:28:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees its supposed to do that in the fiddle
[16:29:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so the fiddle works.
[16:29:17] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees but i want it to append a .reacted class on click of expanding
[16:29:24] <Es0teric> to an anchor
[16:29:51] <taplar_> so do it.  which anchor?
[16:29:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:30:03] <Es0teric> taplar_ its dynamic
[16:30:07] <Es0teric> refer to the paste
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:30:20] <taplar_> i'm looking at the fiddle, there are anchors
[16:30:31] <taplar_> what's the logic for knowing which anchor to put the class on?
[16:30:34] <robertmaxrees> mock out the markup that you're working with at the time of the click.
[16:30:34] <taplar_> in english
[16:30:52] <Es0teric> taplar_ whatever the ajax returns res.data.activities[0].type
[16:31:41] <taplar_> so it would be one of the sad/happy/like ?
[16:31:50] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah
[16:32:09] <taplar_> so a nested element to the thing you fade in
[16:32:17] <Es0teric> yeah
[16:32:22] <Es0teric> its in a data attr
[16:32:29] <Es0teric> that resides in the anchor
[16:32:33] <taplar_> ok, so what is an example of res.data.activities[0].type?
[16:33:04] <taplar_> and fwiw, the 'data-bp-reaction-type' in that fiddle are all blank
[16:33:08] <Es0teric> taplar_  type: "bp_activity_reaction_angry"
[16:33:17] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah i know
[16:33:24] <Es0teric> i left them blank intentionally in the fiddle
[16:33:30] <Es0teric> i just wanted the attributes there
[16:33:33] <taplar_> so what would their values be?
[16:33:54] <Es0teric> [04:33 PM] •  « Es0teric »	taplar_  type: "bp_activity_reaction_angry"
[16:34:09] <Es0teric> thats one example
[16:34:19] <taplar_> ok, so update that fiddle with values, and try selecting one of them, like happy, after you toggle show it
[16:34:52] <Es0teric> why do i need to update the fiddle with values? you already know what it should contain
[16:34:54] <Es0teric> i have the code
[16:34:58] <Es0teric> in pastebin
[16:35:03] <Es0teric> it should be simple enough to figure out
[16:35:05] <taplar_> because that fiddle is a functioning example of the logic
[16:35:19] <taplar_> and you can see, and we more importantly, if it works
[16:37:03] <Es0teric> taplar_ https://jsfiddle.net/o7x6kpd5/10/ i did the first two lists
[16:37:37] <taplar_> why do those two select chains look differently?
[16:37:44] <taplar_> you know one of them works, cause it does the fade in
[16:38:00] <Es0teric> dude
[16:38:15] <taplar_> it's a valid question
[16:38:21] <Es0teric> you have the stuff there man... dont worry about why they look different.. im trying to achieve one thing
[16:38:35] <Es0teric> my question is why doesnt it work
[16:38:40] <Es0teric> its not adding the class
[16:38:43] <taplar_> X works.  but fuck it.  i'm going to try Y ?
[16:38:46] <taplar_> no dude
[16:39:11] <taplar_> you know one toggle the visibility of a parent of the thing you are trying to affect
[16:39:19] <taplar_> which means it's selector gets the parent
[16:39:33] <taplar_> it's only further alterations to the to find the nested child you want to change other wise
[16:39:42] <Es0teric> right
[16:39:46] <taplar_> so do it
[16:39:55] <Es0teric> do what
[16:39:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:39:58] <Es0teric> =_=
[16:40:10] <Es0teric> i sense you are trying to walk me through this so i can figure it out on my own
[16:40:12] <taplar_> take the selector that you used to toggle the visiblity and find the desired nested element
[16:40:18] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric that's the idea.
[16:41:49] <Es0teric> taplar_ so then $(this).closest('.activity-item').find('[data-bp-activity-reaction-type=bp_activity_reaction_sad]').addClass('reacted');
[16:41:50] <Es0teric> ?
[16:42:04] <GanzAndere> robertmaxrees, https://psychedelicsdaily.com/radio/ <- live and working well. Thank you so much for your help!
[16:42:18] <GanzAndere> All the time was away, I setup nginx proxy to do icecast securely
[16:42:22] <taplar_> you left off one part of the original selector, but you could try that and see
[16:42:25] <GanzAndere> otherwise icecast seems broken.
[16:42:36] <GanzAndere> Too many headaches trying to secure it. Might as well proxy over nginx
[16:42:45] <GanzAndere> Thanks <3 time to take a lunch break
[16:43:14] <GanzAndere> And also, initially the metadata loads from json, but after that, only 1 min
[16:43:33] <Es0teric> taplar_ it doesnt work
[16:43:41] <GanzAndere> Es0teric, he did that with me this afternoon. I undestood and made it

[16:53:03] <Es0teric> no it does not work
[16:53:11] <taplar_> my inspector says otherwise

[16:57:01] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you know that only the first two groups in there will work, right?
[16:57:17] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah i mentioned that earlier
[16:57:20] <duch_kazatel> 'kay.
[16:57:23] <duch_kazatel> well it's working here.
[16:57:30] <Es0teric> its not working for me
[17:00:15] <taplar_> bak, mmmm, chocolate cupcake
[17:00:30] <taplar_> when you say 'not working', that doesn't help us.  please specify what is not working
[17:01:03] <Es0teric> taplar_ we've been talking about the one specific thing
[17:01:08] <taplar_> you see or don't see something that you are associating with 'not working'.  that's what we need to know
[17:01:08] <Es0teric> the adding of the class "reacted"
[17:01:11] <Es0teric> thats whats not working
[17:01:16] <taplar_> which i am seeing as working
[17:01:19] <Es0teric> its not adding it
[17:01:20] <Es0teric> which i am not
[17:01:21] <taplar_> why do you say it isn't working?
[17:01:29] <taplar_> where are you looking?
[17:01:33] <Es0teric> because i do not see the class
[17:01:38] <taplar_> where are you looking?
[17:01:38] <Es0teric> on the element
[17:01:41] <taplar_> how?
[17:01:42] <Es0teric> in the inspector obv
[17:01:52] <taplar_> view source or the inspector?
[17:01:59] <Es0teric> i just said the inspector

[17:02:09] <taplar_> robby?
[17:03:22] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/o7x6kpd5/14/  so you don't see a red background on the anchor there?
[17:05:17] <Es0teric> yeah i see it now
[17:05:19] <Es0teric> =_=
[17:05:22] <Es0teric> but its not working in my actual implementation
[17:10:18] <duch_kazatel> ohai
[17:21:49] <relipse> what does this mean: return $.Deferred().resolve({hide:hideQuestionBlocks, show:showQuestionBlocks}).promise();
[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> return a promise.
[17:33:27] <taplar_> kinda weird
[17:33:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah kind of a weird way to do it.
[17:33:55] <taplar_> can you get an unresolved promise off of a resolved deferred?
[17:36:56] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/9hr5duhs/ yeah, no
[17:37:01] <taplar_> that doesn't make sense
[17:38:23] <robertmaxrees> smells like a function refactor that's trying to make sure it returns what it used to.
[18:03:06] <GanzAndere> hey robertmaxrees
[18:03:19] <GanzAndere> It takes forever to load the json data, it says waiting for available socket
[18:03:28] <GanzAndere> how come there is not enough sockets
[18:03:35] <GanzAndere> I though there were 35565 sockets
[18:04:22] <GanzAndere> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23679968/chrome-hangs-after-certain-amount-of-data-transfered-waiting-for-available-soc
[18:04:27] <GanzAndere> Interesting
[18:04:30] <GanzAndere> so this is a server problem.
[18:04:31] <GanzAndere> ok bye
[18:08:04] <robertmaxrees> how many seperate assets are you loading>?
[18:12:48] <qakhan> hi all, i have a combo list where user select company name and records request goes to DB for that company
[18:13:48] <qakhan> 1st slection works, but when user select second company then both companies name selected
[18:14:08] <qakhan> i made lil example here whats going on http://jsfiddle.net/mNtcL/10/
[18:14:58] <taplar_> why are you doing an interval in a change event?
[18:15:23] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:15:26] <qakhan> in actual code i am getting record every 10 sec
[18:15:30] <robertmaxrees> why
[18:15:34] <robertmaxrees> also: don't set that in the handler.
[18:15:43] <taplar_> based off of what that value was when it was changed, never ending
[18:15:51] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you set one interval for each change.
[18:15:55] <taplar_> even if the value changes, that interval will use the old value
[18:16:49] <qakhan> should it not change the value when new selection
[18:17:00] <qakhan> with* new selection
[18:17:02] <taplar_> no, that local var will not change
[18:17:13] <robertmaxrees> and you can read the val pretty easily.
[18:17:21] <robertmaxrees> $('#select_company_name').val();
[18:17:27] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need.
[18:17:59] <qakhan> robertmaxrees i need selected option Val
[18:18:10] <robertmaxrees> $('#select_company_name').val(); gets you that.
[18:18:19] <robertmaxrees> exactly the same as what you had before.
[18:18:21] <robertmaxrees> just... less code.
[18:19:47] <qakhan> with $('#select_company_name').val(); i am getting both companies
[18:20:01] <qakhan> i want only selected company
[18:21:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mNtcL/12/
[18:21:17] <taplar_> http://jsfiddle.net/mNtcL/11/
[18:21:19] <taplar_> lol
[18:21:21] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:21:24] <robertmaxrees> gets you just one.,
[18:22:01] <robertmaxrees> setting intervals in there is a terrible idea.
[18:22:19] <taplar_> http://jsfiddle.net/mNtcL/13/  yeah i was trying to figure out a clean way to do timeout, but i decided to be lazy
[18:23:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mNtcL/14/
[18:23:37] <robertmaxrees> no need to set the interval in the handler at all tbh
[18:23:51] <robertmaxrees> but if that's gonna be an ajax call, don't use setInterval
[18:24:03] <taplar_> ^
[18:24:29] <qakhan> robertmaxrees yes it will be ajax call
[18:24:40] <robertmaxrees> hah, we had this earlier!
[18:24:47] <qakhan> i am query to DB via ajax
[18:24:59] <robertmaxrees> setInterval makes assumptions that are bad for ajax.
[18:25:30] <qakhan> i have to get record status after 10 sec
[18:25:35] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:25:36] <robertmaxrees> sec./
[18:26:23] <taplar_> what if it takes one request 3 seconds to execute?
[18:26:31] <robertmaxrees> or 11
[18:27:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mNtcL/15/
[18:27:47] <robertmaxrees> stick that makeTheCall(); in the .then() of the ajax call and you're g2g
[18:33:11] <qakhan> robertmaxrees this function runs on page load, i want to run it on company selection
[18:34:32] <robertmaxrees> then change it?
[18:34:48] <taplar_> lol
[18:34:50] <taplar_> today rules
[18:35:00] <robertmaxrees> like.. pretty easy to setup there heh
[18:58:43] <qakhan> here http://jsfiddle.net/mNtcL/17/
[18:58:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:58:58] <robertmaxrees> no
[18:59:11] <robertmaxrees> fhttp://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mNtcL/18/
[18:59:17] <robertmaxrees> but this is flawed, as well.
[18:59:27] <robertmaxrees> oh actually nvm.
[18:59:39] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it has potential for jank.
[19:00:52] <qakhan> do you see that how quickly it call function. when i select 2nd company and then 1st company.
[19:01:04] <robertmaxrees> ... right?
[19:01:24] <qakhan> its not respecting given time in SetTimeout
[19:01:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah it is.
[19:01:40] <robertmaxrees> you have 1000ms there.
[19:01:50] <qakhan> which is 1 sec
[19:02:05] <robertmaxrees> which it's doing.
[19:02:32] <qakhan> ok select 1st company and then select 2nd company
[19:02:42] <qakhan> you will see the difference
[19:02:42] <robertmaxrees> describe the bug.
[19:03:06] <robertmaxrees> what's the point duder?
[19:03:12] <qakhan> its calling makeTheCall() twice
[19:03:29] <qakhan> and it grows when you select different companies
[19:03:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:04:08] <qakhan> it calls makeTheCall in ms
[19:04:24] <qakhan> when you keep chenging the options
[19:04:24] <robertmaxrees> right.  you'd have to add in a check to prevent that.
[19:04:48] <qakhan> y, we ask makeTheCall to run every 1000ms
[19:05:25] <robertmaxrees> makeTheCall starts the whole thing over again.  it doesn't replace the original one.
[19:06:04] <qakhan> right but run after 1000ms
[19:06:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:06:10] <qakhan> not less than that
[19:06:13] <robertmaxrees> so then flip thgings around.
[19:06:29] <qakhan> how
[19:06:33] <robertmaxrees> really?
[19:06:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't see at all how to make it wait 1000ms the first time?
[19:07:28] <robertmaxrees> if calling getValue() makes it do it once immediately and then every second...
[19:08:02] <robertmaxrees> seems like an obvious change.
[19:11:44] <qakhan> its already there
[19:11:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:12:04] <qakhan> we call getValue(); on selection
[19:12:12] <qakhan> then  setTimeout(getValue, 1000);
[19:12:15] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:12:26] <robertmaxrees> so if you'd rather have it wait a second first, what do you do?
[19:13:06] <qakhan> so why its not runnig after 1000ms
[19:13:13] <robertmaxrees> dude lol
[19:13:15] <robertmaxrees> look at the code.
[19:13:24] <robertmaxrees> the solution is right there.
[19:13:34] <robertmaxrees> right now it calls one function which calls the other that sets the timeout.
[19:13:44] <robertmaxrees> so if you'd rather have it do the timneout first...
[19:15:31] <qakhan> sorry did not get it
[19:16:24] <robertmaxrees> so if getValue() fires makeTheCall(), and makeTheCall() sets a timeout of 1000 ms and then calls getValue() again...
[19:16:34] <robertmaxrees> and you'd rather wait 1000ms >.>
[19:18:06] <robertmaxrees> you have 2 functions to call and one of the two doesn't do what you want it to.
[19:21:46] <qakhan> like this http://jsfiddle.net/mNtcL/21/
[19:21:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[19:21:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:22:01] <robertmaxrees> really?
[19:22:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mNtcL/22/
[19:22:21] <robertmaxrees> just gotta start with makeTheCall();
[19:25:08] <qakhan> this still not working
[19:25:15] <robertmaxrees> what's wrong with this one?
[19:25:20] <robertmaxrees> (being vague is unhelpful)(
[19:25:37] <qakhan> when select 2nd company see the time
[19:25:48] <qakhan> it twice in 1000ms
[19:25:52] <robertmaxrees> be explicit with your problem description.
[19:26:01] <robertmaxrees> "it's doing x, but I need it to do y"
[19:26:50] <qakhan> as i explaing before. it works on 1st selection
[19:26:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:27:10] <robertmaxrees> so really
[19:27:31] <robertmaxrees> what you want is to start getting them every 10 seconds, but only after they've made their first selection?
[19:27:33] <qakhan> but when select 2nd option it does not respect the time
[19:28:23] <qakhan> whenever option selected run after 1 sec or 10 sec
[19:28:32] <robertmaxrees> so not repeatedly?
[19:28:34] <robertmaxrees> just once?
[19:28:52] <qakhan> yes repeatedly
[19:29:07] <qakhan> run after 1 sec
[19:29:20] <robertmaxrees> so once per second after their first selection?
[19:30:19] <qakhan> run after every 1 sec no matter which option selected
[19:30:28] <qakhan> 1st 2nd 3rd.......
[19:30:36] <robertmaxrees> that's a weird interface.
[19:30:41] <qakhan> nooooo
[19:31:56] <robertmaxrees> why would it update like that but only after i've made a selection?
[19:33:42] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[19:34:13] <robertmaxrees> just set a var like var callsHaveBeenStarted = false; at the top of your doc ready, then check/set in the change handler.
