[00:42:30] <Cork> noahmg123: you've got it working?
[00:43:48] <noahmg123> Cork: no, I just used `.find(selector2). remove()` I might look into it later, though.
[00:44:06] <Cork> noahmg123: and there you have why it didn't work
[00:44:16] <noahmg123> Hm? Wdym?
[00:44:20] <Cork> noahmg123: .remove(selector) works the same as $().filter().remove()
[00:44:26] <Cork> it doesn't search for child elements
[00:44:48] <Cork> while .find() only looks for child elements and doesn't filter the set you currently have
[00:45:13] <noahmg123> Oh ok
[14:59:50] <forgotmynick> hello. is it possible for a local html file to get a URL from a remote server where there is no access control headers etc?
[15:10:43] <dw1> yes with a proxy that has access control headers
[15:11:05] <dw1> there's a herokuapp url that works...
[15:11:47] <dw1> https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/
[15:11:56] <dw1> just call https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://example.com
[15:11:58] <dw1> for example
[15:22:58] <forgotmynick> i was hoping to do this without that
[15:23:25] <dw1> you can only do it with an extension that has permission
[15:23:47] <dw1> or a proxy
[17:00:13] <Cork> dw1: are you sure about that, as far as i know local files can't ever get access to remote servers
[17:00:27] <Cork> as it could mean it can upload sensitive files from the system
[17:01:13] <Cork> you need any form of http* protocol to be able to use cors
[17:08:38] <dw1> oh
[17:11:10] <dw1> no im not sure. youre prob right
[20:17:51] <phxheat> hello. im losing my mind trying to figure out how to do something simple.  when a form is submitted, i want it it first run some javascript (takes a few seconds) , have it populate a fields value in the form, and THEN submit; how do i CORRECTLY do this? im using $('form').submit() and event.preventDefault but ultimately it requires clicking the submit button twice to work right. im event
[20:17:52] <phxheat> unbinding. what am i doing wrong?
[20:25:28] <dw1> you could use a global variable to store whether the form was submitted once
[20:25:45] <dw1> so you could skip the preventDefault
[20:26:19] <phxheat> dw1: i tried that; not working
[20:27:14] <dw1> var dostep2=false; $('#form').submit(function(e){ if(!dostep2) e.preventDefault(); /* set some stuff */ dostep2=true; $(this).submit()
[20:27:18] <dw1> erm
[20:27:34] <dw1> well if(!dostep2) $(this).submit()
[20:27:39] <dw1> then the rest of the code
[20:28:06] <dw1> erm
[20:28:21] <dw1> if(!dostep2){ dostep2=true; $(this).submit(); }
[20:28:28] <dw1> :}
[20:29:10] <dw1> with the step1 code in there too
[20:29:41] <dw1> but if it takes a few seconds youll need some async callback action
[20:29:43] <dw1> maybe
[20:30:37] <dw1> unless it's not async stuff
[20:31:38] <dw1> i dont know what would possibly take a few seconds that isnt async though
