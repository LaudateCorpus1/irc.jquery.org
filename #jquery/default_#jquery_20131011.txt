[00:00:27] <nisseni> cork, got it
[00:18:34] <Zogot> Ahoy all. Does .offset().top return different values for people in chrome from Refresh and initial page load?  Would anyone happen to know a solution?
[01:46:10] <murr4y> can .attr() be called so it doesn't escape backslashes? e.g. "foo\nbar" so that the newline isn't escaped?
[01:46:58] <Nephro> When requesting form hmtl from ajax, my <select> malfunctions and becomes empty. If I just use the url of the ajax request it works fine, any ideas?
[01:47:01] <Cork> murr4y: it isn't attr doing that
[01:47:07] <Cork> it is the js engine
[01:47:20] <murr4y> oh
[01:47:30] <Cork> "\\n"
[01:47:37] <murr4y> yeah, that didn't work either
[01:47:53] <murr4y> it gave \\n as the result
[01:49:01] <ArmitaageDS> Hi there. I need some help getting http://jsfiddle.net/Q4jy9/1/ to work with an array of objects instead. The problem is that I am very new to jquery and get lost in the syntax pretty quickly, but I would like to add autocomplete to my site
[01:49:21] <Cork> murr4y: ah, you mean you want to have a line break in the attribute?
[01:49:26] <murr4y> yes
[01:49:27] <Cork> murr4y: that isn't valid for dom
[01:49:41] <murr4y> oh :(
[01:50:09] <murr4y> it seems &#10; works
[01:51:55] <__equinox> what is the new standard way to do browser feature detection in jQuery 2.0?
[01:52:05] <__equinox> because the default $.browser has been deprecated
[01:52:12] <__equinox> and in the docs it says to use feature detection
[01:52:19] <__equinox> but I want to save the browser name
[01:57:03] <lemonsparrow> hi... I want to implement a scenario : when the user logs into the application if the current day is monday, a modal window/popup should appear with a form and only once the user submits the form he should be allowed to view the homepage or whichever page he is visiting...
[01:57:28] <lemonsparrow> is it possible to implement this logic of checking date is monday and all in jquery /
[01:57:58] <lemonsparrow> new Date().getDay(); kinda thing
[01:59:14] <Nephro> When requesting form hmtl from ajax, my <select> malfunctions and becomes empty. If I just use the url of the ajax request it works fine, any ideas?
[01:59:24] <ArmitaageDS> Sorry, I got disconnected and had trouble logging in again
[02:00:02] <lemonsparrow> something like new Date().toString().contains("Mon")
[02:00:04] <steinarts> lemonsparrow: no reason to use jquery for that, javascript can do that
[02:00:27] <steinarts> lemonsparrow: http://w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_getday.asp
[02:00:33] <lemonsparrow> steinarts: but this should be across the application... user is trying to access any page
[02:02:30] <ArmitaageDS> Anyone able to help a rookie out? My array of objects contains label and value properties only
[02:03:28] <__equinox> how do I differentiate tablet, mobile, desktop via javascript/jquery?
[02:03:34] <__equinox> truing to save this data to my server
[02:04:24] <Cork> __equinox: you can't really do that reliably
[02:04:34] <__equinox> Cork: hmmm..why is that?
[02:04:34] <Cork> you can go for ua sniffing, but that is about it
[02:04:40] <Cork> cause it isn't exposed
[02:05:00] <Cork> you can get hints from the ua, but not explicit info
[02:05:20] <Cork> and those hints dpesm
[02:05:32] <Cork> doesn't always make a difference between tablet and mobile
[02:05:33] <beachandbytes> screen dimensions are your best bet
[02:05:43] <lemonsparrow> is there a way of including a js file across all pages of my app Cork
[02:05:57] <Cork> lemonsparrow: add the script tag in the head
[02:06:15] <Cork> beachandbytes: that basically only works for ios
[02:06:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yep I know that... so u mean to say do that for all pages individually ?
[02:06:31] <ArmitaageDS> Only way
[02:06:32] <beachandbytes> Cork what do you mean?
[02:06:48] <Cork> as android uses different dimentions for different devices, and you can't count on the resolution to be lower on the device then a desktop
[02:10:47] <steinarts> the question should be "why do i want to differentiate"
[02:11:18] <ArmitaageDS> lemonsparrow: can we assume that you have a site with quite a few pages that you need to link a js file to? The only way is to include it with <script src="url"></script> individually.
[02:11:27] <Cork> doesn't look like he wants to, it looks like he want to log it
[02:12:44] <lemonsparrow> ArmitaageDS: ok... that is what I am doing now :)
[02:14:51] <ArmitaageDS> Be back in about an hour(hope it's less than that), going underground on the subway.
[02:15:18] <steinarts> then i'd just log the navigator.userAgent tbh
[02:15:47] <Cork> steinarts: second warning, that can easily be spoofed
[02:16:38] <steinarts> Cork: everything can :)
[02:17:14] <steinarts> in fact there is no guaranteed way of detecting browser or device as there really is no need, however feature-detection is a different matter, and for that you have modernizr
[02:17:24] <Cork> steinarts: sure, but this one has a toggle in some browsers (most mobile) and extensions exist for the other ones
[02:18:00] <Cork> the toggle to desktop mode in mobile devices changes the ua
[02:18:28] <steinarts> i've just been using window size and ua, gives a good indicator
[02:35:12] <jonkristian> How do I avoid these? Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'summernote'
[02:35:32] <jonkristian> Usually i use length but for textareas the length can be 0
[02:37:06] <Cork> jonkristian: what is object?
[02:37:08] <jonkristian> Isn't there a proper way to check if someting should be initialized, is this because the plugin lacks something?
[02:38:18] <jonkristian> Cork, It happens because I don't have textareas in all my pages and I use summer note editor.
[02:38:39] <jonkristian> Not all pages has .summernote > $('.summernote').summernote();
[02:39:03] <Cork> jonkristian: well if the plugin isn't loaded the page won't know about it's existance
[02:39:23] <jonkristian> This is not exclusive to summernote, it happens with other stuff so I've been using if($('this-id').text().length)
[02:40:47] <jonkristian> Maybe i should split up my js
[02:41:29] <Cork> jonkristian: no the last one should work just fine
[02:41:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/HMvqk/
[02:41:39] <Cork> jquery handles no matches
[02:41:42] <Cork> but no missing plugins
[02:41:51] <jonkristian> right, that's what I was thinking
[02:41:51] <Cork> *but not
[02:41:52] <jonkristian> ah!
[02:41:58] <jonkristian> I see
[02:42:06] <jonkristian> That's my problem
[02:42:20] <jonkristian> Cork, saved me again, thanks! :)
[02:42:22] <Cork> though that could be easily handles
[02:42:34] <Cork> $.fn.summernote = $.noop;
[02:42:41] <Cork> or rather
[02:42:56] <Cork> if(!!$.fn.summernote) { $.fn.summernote = $.noop; }
[02:43:03] <Cork> uh
[02:43:06] <Cork> if(!$.fn.summernote) { $.fn.summernote = $.noop; }
[02:43:07] <Cork> :x
[02:44:11] <jonkristian> I see
[02:45:09] <jonkristian> I'm thinking if I have a lot of plugins in different areas, maybe the best thing would be to split up my js to a degree.
[02:46:16] <ArmitaageDS> And, I am back. Only took half an hour.
[03:00:56] <glosoli> hmm I am using jquery dropkick plugin, any ideas if there is some way to check if the element is initialized to be dropkick or not ?
[03:06:24] <_rgn> read the source and see if it sets some kind of data attribute on the element
[03:06:27] <_rgn> glosoli: ^
[03:06:46] <glosoli> aa ok thanks thought there might be some default way :)
[03:07:11] <krambiorix> hi, is there any way to detect if the user is using a comma or dot as decimal separator?
[03:09:04] <Cork> js> (1.1).toLocaleString()[1]
[03:09:09] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:09:13] <Cork> js> print((1.1).toLocaleString()[1])
[03:09:18] <b-ot> Cork: .
[03:09:51] <Cork> though it will be based on the language of the browser, not there country or similar
[03:10:32] <cnap_> Hey people
[03:10:37] <cnap_> I wanna do something similar to this: http://prntscr.com/1wg0c2 ... So I need something a drop down menu or a slider moving downwards in order to display some albums. Any suggestions ?
[03:12:57] <ArmitaageDS> cnap_: I'm thinking of using <select> here, personally
[03:14:15] <ArmitaageDS> Adding onchange event to it, it won't need to be in a form
[03:16:36] <ArmitaageDS> Or you could use a div with a fixed height and use overflow-y:scroll on the div
[03:18:04] <ArmitaageDS> Although that won't work very well in the default browser on Android 2.3 and earlier, it's a bug with overflow-y
[03:20:22] <gregf_> hello, the javascript channel does not let me post any messages :/
[03:21:07] <Cork> greg_f: 1. its ##javascript and 2. you need to register your nick
[03:22:00] <Cork> opps
[03:22:03] <Cork> *gregf_:
[03:29:01] <ArmitaageDS> Cork, I'm sorry if I missed the reply, any chance I could get some help getting http://jsfiddle.net/Q4jy9/1 to work with an array of {label: "str", value: "str"} objects instead? I understand javascript well enough, but am very new to the jquery plugin. I am trying to provide an autocomplete that allows a user to find a result regardless of what order he types the terms
[03:29:26] <gregf_> Cork: ##javascript Cannot send to channel <== i get this message
[03:29:57] <gregf_> i just joined #jquery . never had to do anything in addition to joining :/
[03:30:47] <_rgn> register your nick
[03:31:17] <_rgn> http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-User-Name-on-Freenode
[03:33:41] <Cork> gregf_: try registering you nick
[03:33:58] <Cork> oh, already told :)
[03:35:25] <gregf_> Cork:Thanks
[03:36:51] <Cork> ArmitaageDS: it isn't obvious to me what that script is doing, and i'm a bit tight on time right now
[03:40:09] <sahbeewah> ArmitaageDS, the docs implies that that works out of the box
[03:40:20] <sahbeewah> where are you having issues
[03:41:25] <ArmitaageDS> I see. I can wait a while, could you have a look later on today, please? The script is supposed to overwrite the default autocomplete behaviour by tokenizing the term and returning results if they contain all the search terms, regardless of what order they are in. The only thing is that when I use an array of {label: "str",  value: "str"}  objects, I get no results
[03:42:13] <sahbeewah> http://jsfiddle.net/Q4jy9/48/
[03:44:34] <ArmitaageDS> Thanks, sahbeewah
[04:04:16] <jim87> I'm trying to let an inner div hide and then display: none, animating the container div to fit the new height. The problems are 2: (1) delay(1000) seems to be ignored, (2) the container div seems to ignore the height's transition. Any help? http://jsfiddle.net/TnS3x/2/
[04:06:47] <jim87> alternatively I'd like to manually resize the container div via jQuery animations, but I don't know where to start
[04:20:32] <Cork> jim87: css isn't an animated function
[04:20:50] <Cork> jim87: use setTimeout instead
[04:20:50] <jim87> Cork: but CSS's height transition is...
[04:21:05] <jim87> Cork: found out delay() defaults to the "fx" queue
[04:21:09] <Cork> jquery knows nothing about that
[04:21:34] <Cork> jim87: if you want js to depend on css transitions you need to use transitionend event liteners
[04:21:38] <Cork> *listeners
[04:21:48] <jim87> Cork: how can I display a height change in jQuery?
[04:22:06] <Cork> also display: none collapses the element
[04:22:10] <Cork> so it doesn't have a height
[04:22:30] <jim87> Cork: display: none collapses the element, but the container div should change its height, isn't it?
[04:22:37] <Cork> no
[04:22:45] <Cork> as the child is collapsed
[04:22:50] <Cork> it won't affect the height of the parent
[04:22:56] <jim87> can I produce a similar effect with jQuery?
[04:23:22] <Cork> well tostart with you need to remove display: none so the element gets it's height
[04:23:29] <Cork> then grab that, set display:none
[04:23:33] <Cork> animate the parent
[04:23:37] <Cork> then remove display none
[04:24:00] <jim87> yep, I thought about keeping the original height, but what about if the user resizes the window? height would change
[04:24:11] <Cork> yup
[04:24:19] <jim87> (I'm considering in-out effects, not only out)
[04:24:39] <Cork> the height you set needs to be cleared when the animation is done
[04:24:54] <Cork> but yes, if the window is resized while the animation happens, things will break
[04:25:07] <jim87> I could animate the inner div's height to 0, but what about the in effect?
[04:25:56] <Cork> the in effect?
[04:26:45] <jim87> well, I could set the inner div's height to 0 (using CSS transition), that should do the trick, if height animation is supported
[04:26:47] <jim87> gonna check
[04:27:01] <xqo> is there ever any reason not to use jquery instead of javascript? Is it any less compatible or anything?
[04:27:11] <Cork> jim87: height is supported except for auto
[04:27:32] <jim87> Cork: so I need to set the height... uhm... could max-height do the trick?
[04:27:36] <Cork> xqo: the only reason not to use it is the overhead of loading the lib
[04:27:54] <Cork> jim87: yes
[04:28:03] <Cork> but it will animate based on that number
[04:28:05] <Cork> not the current height
[04:28:14] <xqo> Cork is that ever significant enough to do anything?
[04:28:22] <xqo> realistically
[04:28:28] <jim87> =\ I need a more proper solution... any JavaScript one that could do that?
[04:28:41] <Cork> max-height: 10000000000000000; => max-height: 0; will animate from 10000000000000000 to 0 not auto
[04:28:56] <Cork> jim87: set the height through js before you do the animation
[04:29:19] <jim87> Cork: yep, but how can I calculate the right "in" height?
[04:29:22] <Cork> xqo: yes, though it depends on how picky you are
[04:29:28] <xqo> Cork ?
[04:29:39] <jim87> I have to do that when the user clicks on the button or whatever, he/she may have resized the window
[04:29:49] <Cork> jim87: css('height', $(this).height() + 'px')
[04:30:13] <Cork> you will have to disable the transition on the element while you set it up
[04:30:20] <Cork> but that should be easy enough to do with a class
[04:30:30] <jim87> yeah I'd toggle class
[04:30:53] <jim87> but when I set the height to 0 (out effect), shouldn't $(this).height() return 0 then?
[04:32:02] <Cork> yes
[04:32:20] <jim87> and then again, how can I calculate the in-height?
[04:32:23] <Cork> an option would be to set max-height: currentHeight
[04:32:34] <Cork> and then animate max-height
[04:32:57] <jim87> that's more reasonable
[04:33:10] <Cork> hmm
[04:33:15] <Cork> wait no that won't work either
[04:33:22] <jim87> but if the user resizes the window in a smaller screen, that would truncate the div
[04:33:46] <Cork> jim87: this should happen just as the animation is about to kick off
[04:34:00] <Cork> and it should be cleared when the animation ends
[04:34:25] <Cork> else you will have to keep monitoring resize on the window and calculate changes
[04:34:41] <jim87> yeah, but I have to set max-height: (current-height) when I do the out effect, otherwise max-height will be 0 in any case
[04:46:04] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/KS78p/ <-- how is that choppy?
[04:47:11] <DRSK> It seems every time I try to animate something with a duration over 1.5 seconds the animation gets choppy. What gives?
[04:51:39] <jim87> Cork: I just figured out the height won't change lol
[04:51:47] <blk_panther> how (if) is it possible to not switch tabs if an other tab is activted (clicked, ...) but have some code alter the content [e.g. just change background color of my text (stupid example, but you get the idea)]
[04:52:09] <Cork> DRSK: welcome to the world of js animations
[04:52:24] <Cork> DRSK: i would suggest looking at css3 or requestAnimationFrame
[04:52:44] <DRSK> Cork » I've been looking at the frames in chrome and I just don't understand why it's choppy or why painting takes so long, even using .stop() to make sure only one is present
[04:52:55] <Cork> blk_panther: are you talking about jquery ui tabs ?
[04:53:03] <blk_panther> yes I do
[04:53:29] <jim87> DRSK: try with something like this: http://giacomofurlan.name/posts/css-carousel-with-js-controller
[04:53:32] <DRSK> Well, in this case.. one has specifically turned off CSS3 animations, so I have to animate using jQ, but it's so choppy. Just trying to optimize it a bit. Without luck of course, the example provided is as simple as it gets and still choppy.
[04:53:44] <Cork> DRSK: the animation isn't precise cause it is built around setInterval, and it isn't precise
[04:54:05] <DRSK> can I force animate to use something else like requestAnimationFrame?
[04:54:26] <Cork> DRSK: so if you are unlucky you animate one frame just after a rendering, and then you get delayed for the second one cause of gc or something
[04:54:41] <Cork> DRSK: there is a patch for jquery to use animatinoFrame
[04:55:07] <jim87> DRSK: Javascript tries to move the div at each frame, but it's choppy due to (1) incorrect TOT frames / available frames, (2) it's not a "real" animation, it's a stop-motion like thing
[04:55:15] <Cork> but they can't add it to the core cause too many broken slideshows doesn't know how to do animation
[04:55:33] <Cork> jim87: no js doesn't try to move it at each frame
[04:55:46] <Cork> it tries to move it "often enough" to not miss a frame
[04:56:06] <Cork> but without requestAnimationFrame you don't know when the frame rendering happens
[04:56:36] <jim87> Cork: I thought CSS3 animations where meant to have frame sync and thus fluidity
[04:56:50] <Cork> jim87: this is .animate() it isn't css3
[04:57:10] <Cork> jim87: but yes, css3 and requestAnimationFrame doesn't have the same problem
[04:57:15] <DRSK> Although seeing the example provided by jim, I don't understand how that isn't choppy ;p
[04:57:21] <jim87> Cork: yep indeed I was arguing about CSS3 vs "normal" JS
[04:57:39] <jim87> DRSK: my tutorial uses pure CSS3 transitions
[04:58:06] <Cork> i'm quite annoyed about the slideshow developers that forced jquery to stop supporting AnimationFrame...
[04:58:17] <Cork> it was a stupid move
[04:58:23] <DRSK> oh right now I see jim, ;p
[04:58:36] <jim87> I ♥ CSS3 :P
[04:58:39] <DRSK> Yeah as I said, I'm using CSS3 to animate the slider, but I have this option and fallback to using animate
[04:58:52] <DRSK> and that's when things get choppy as fawk.
[04:59:03] <Cork> DRSK: ah, then requestAnimationFrame won't help you either
[04:59:18] <Cork> cause it isn't supported in ie anyway
[04:59:30] <jim87> yeah I know, I took a work not that long time ago asking for IE6 support - at least the commitment was "working showing contents" rofl
[04:59:35] <DRSK> Cork » IE at all or.. ie8? 9?
[04:59:36] <blk_panther> so that's webdev nowadays? css3 with fallback to js? [I have disabled js :(]
[04:59:53] <Cork> DRSK: is as at least not <ie10
[05:00:03] <jim87> requestAnimationFrame is supported in IE10: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh773174(v=vs.85).aspx
[05:00:30] <DRSK> Yeah, hm. Can I use requestAnimationFrame for when it's supported and just don't give a f* and leave it choppy else?
[05:00:37] <Cork> blk_panther: my stand is normally that animations isn't important enough for a fallback
[05:00:49] <blk_panther> any luck with my question [13:51]? or do I have to ask again later?
[05:00:50] <jim87> yep, animation is really an eye candy
[05:00:55] <Cork> blk_panther: so browsers that doesn't support transitions gets jumps
[05:01:20] <Cork> those browsers normally isn't fast enough to give good animations anyway, so it would only look bad anyway
[05:01:20] <blk_panther> ah, I see; that's fine
[05:01:46] <DRSK> Oh well while on the subject of CSS3 animation, how can I temporarily stop it from transitioning? Can I set transition: none; with a class while changing a value then remove the class?
[05:01:49] <jim87> blk_panther: please reformulate your question, I didn't understand it
[05:02:07] <blk_panther> <-- noscript user that's annoyed how much (even big) sites don't work without js
[05:02:14] <blk_panther> I'll try, give me a sec
[05:02:17] <jim87> DRSK: transition: your-property-or-all 0s ease
[05:02:20] <Cork> blk_panther: ya, same here
[05:02:43] <Cork> and for said reason i'm quite forceful about that my self
[05:03:50] <blk_panther> ok, I have 5 versions of a table, minor differences; I want it to look like tabs (jquery ui) but really all I want to do is change my table slightly according to which tab is selected
[05:04:44] <jim87> blk_panther: so you've got tab browsing via JS and want to... edit the current table?
[05:05:01] <jim87> take all the tables and when .is(":visible") is true, process
[05:05:41] <jim87> btw in some cases, like embedded system, I love to abuse of JS, when I know it works :P
[05:05:54] <jim87> for example, async JS-driven websites using AngularJS
[05:05:58] <DRSK> jim87 » so how'd you solve a infinite scrolling slider using CSS3 and jQ? I'm putting the first slide last but then it doesn't work because the x-value is already set ;p
[05:06:15] <blk_panther> but I want only one table, not 5
[05:06:54] <jim87> blk_panther: MVC framework with data binding?
[05:07:21] <blk_panther> ok, I'm bad at examples
[05:07:40] <jim87> DRSK: I didn't right now, and I think it's really an extra
[05:07:43] <blk_panther> jim87: if jquery can do that (it can't?) I'll give it a try
[05:07:48] <Weezey> I'm appending a new div with a bunch of html as a string, but is there a better way so I can use the elements I'm appending immediately via a var?
[05:08:17] <jim87> blk_panther: I'm not aware jQuery is a model-view-controller framework. AngularJS is.
[05:08:22] <jim87> (for example)
[05:08:33] <jim87> (tbh AngularJS is Model-View-Whatever)
[05:08:38] <Weezey> They seem to not work to call them by (".classname"), I'm assuming because they don't exist yet.
[05:09:22] <jim87> Weezey: good 'ol plain JavaScript, append an element to another assigning to a variable, work with it "real time"
[05:10:04] <jim87> Weezey: for example http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createelement.asp
[05:10:06] <Weezey> jim87: k, there's no fancy jquery way?
[05:10:25] <Weezey> Quite familiar with the DOM.
[05:10:25] <jim87> Weezey: there will surely be, I'm not aware of it though
[05:10:37] <Weezey> just makes for a lot of code.
[05:10:40] <jim87> you can select $(something) and append
[05:11:03] <jim87> jQuery is not "JS++", it's just JS, so you can interoperate with no problems at all
[05:11:05] <Weezey> I that's what I'm doing, but the things I append seem to be unavailable to call out after the fact.
[05:11:26] <jim87> Weezey: did you append the child?
[05:11:30] <Weezey> yep
[05:11:38] <jim87> then it should be there
[05:12:02] <Weezey> it shows up, but the code two lines later won't modify the new children
[05:12:30] <Weezey> it's all good, I'll work around it.
[05:12:31] <xqo> what can i use instead of .each($(".abc", function() {myCode();}); when "abc" is an id and not a class? if i dont use .each(), i get undefineds all the tiem
[05:13:20] <Weezey> xqo: $("#abc") is id.
[05:14:15] <xqo> Weezey i need a replacement for .each() that only does stuff if the selected item exists, and nothing if it doesnt
[05:14:22] <xqo> without an if/else block
[05:15:24] <sahbeewah> why would you ever want to do that
[05:15:24] <jim87> Weezey: http://jsfiddle.net/2NUqX/
[05:16:26] <jim87> xqo: if(!my_array_of_objects[0]) return; // no else
[05:16:48] <Weezey> jim87: yeah, mine is a big-ass div with many other divs, with html string.
[05:17:16] <Weezey> jim87: but you've given me a great idea for a shortcut, thanks!
[05:17:23] <sahbeewah> Weezey, you have a selector issue
[05:17:40] <sahbeewah> just place a debugger after you insert the element into the dom, and use the console to try find it
[05:18:09] <Weezey> sahbeewah: k, I'll do that before I scrap my work. thanks
[05:28:11] <JovanJ> Hello
[05:28:38] <JovanJ> I wonder If someone is able to take a look on my code, and see why dosen't works? :)
[05:29:13] <grafi> Nobody
[05:29:17] <grafi> as long as you dont share it
[05:29:18] <grafi> :P
[05:29:45] <JovanJ> Haha:D I'll just a sec to paste it :)
[05:30:12] <JovanJ> Here is it:  http://paste.laravel.com/Y7h
[05:30:27] <JovanJ> It continues posting me Loading new posts
[05:30:29] <JovanJ> and Still loading
[05:30:35] <JovanJ> but other posts doesen't appear
[05:30:42] <JovanJ> I am trying to make infinte post scroll
[05:33:41] <blk_panther> jim87: Cork: hope that explains my thinking: http://jsfiddle.net/Y9bwv/3/
[05:33:56] <blk_panther> everyone else is welcomed too, take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/Y9bwv/3/
[05:34:01] <paldepind> Is there a function similair to get() that doesn't give the DOM element but the jQuery element at an index?
[05:34:20] <Cork> ?api eq
[05:34:20] <b-ot> Cork: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[05:35:51] <sahbeewah> JovanJ, that's a pretty clean template language. based off php?
[05:36:01] <sahbeewah> in any case, are your network requests going through?
[05:36:36] <JovanJ> Yes, you can see I am calling <script> on line 17
[05:36:54] <JovanJ> Yes
[05:37:11] <JovanJ> Loading new posts comes, but other posts are not coming
[05:37:54] <Cork> blk_panther: well you could just use a generic script for all of the tabs
[05:38:38] <sahbeewah> JovanJ, what are the "other posts"? I thought the idea was that it loaded new posts and put 'em on the bottom
[05:39:22] <JovanJ> I mean on that, I said it wrong... So I've posts on my page, and few of them loads for example, and after i come to bottom of page, other posts loads...
[05:39:28] <DarsVaeda> I always forget this, when I have a set and select one element of this set, how do I know which index it is on in the set?
[05:39:41] <JovanJ> Here is the example what do I want: http://mattrogowski.co.uk/
[05:39:53] <JovanJ> Scoll little down and you'll se
[05:39:54] <JovanJ> see*
[05:40:17] <Cork> DarsVaeda: set.index(elm)
[05:40:30] <DarsVaeda> ahh thanks :)
[05:41:22] <sahbeewah> JovanJ, yeah i can see that. so you're saying your thing doesn't load new posts, right?
[05:41:37] <JovanJ> sahbeewah: yes, exactly that.
[05:42:40] <sahbeewah> so what I meant was, check your network requests in your developer tools. and see if the ajax call is actually being called, and more importantly, if it's giving your expected response
[05:43:41] <JovanJ> To be honest, I am not actually sure how to check those things.
[05:43:56] <blk_panther> generic script Cork?
[05:44:13] <sahbeewah> which browser are you using?
[05:44:29] <JovanJ> Firefox
[05:44:50] <sahbeewah> do you have firebug installed?
[05:45:03] <Cork> blk_panther: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-activate
[05:45:15] <JovanJ> No, should I get it?
[05:45:38] <sahbeewah> no, you should get chrome
[05:45:42] <sahbeewah> but yes if you want firefox get firebug
[05:46:11] <sahbeewah> in the meantime, you will have to deal with the sorry excuse of developer tools provided by firefox
[05:46:22] <sahbeewah> right click the page and click inspect element
[05:46:25] <Cork> sahbeewah: the built in development tools is good enough for most users
[05:46:26] <blk_panther> read that, problem: if I prevent changing tabs, it looks like wrong tab is activated, if I don't the content would be empty - any way around that?
[05:46:44] <Cork> firebug is only needed if your custom to using firebug
[05:46:59] <Cork> (then you will miss some of the features it has)
[05:47:15] <JovanJ> I've installed it. And I clicked inspect element
[05:48:14] <sahbeewah> Cork, it's, slow, buggy and unintuitive
[05:48:26] <sahbeewah> JovanJ, so anyway, there will be a network tab
[05:48:37] <sahbeewah> click on that, and then reload the page
[05:49:22] <JovanJ> Under JavaScript there i 8 requests
[05:49:59] <JovanJ> Seems like my network requests are going trough
[05:50:23] <xqo> hi
[05:50:43] <xqo> i think .change() does not fire when you deactivate a radiobutton, only when you activate it
[05:51:02] <xqo> how do i tackle that, when i want to hide/show something based on changing radiobuttons?
[05:51:23] <JovanJ> sahbeewah: On every request there is:  Connection	keep-alive
[05:51:57] <Cork> xqo: bind change for all the radiobuttons
[05:52:41] <sahbeewah> JovanJ, yea that's not relevant to your problem. look for the request being made the url by your ajax call
[05:52:44] <sahbeewah> and see what it's doing
[05:54:13] <JovanJ> Hmm, again I am lost what should i do :/
[05:55:01] <JovanJ> On this line:   	jQuery.ajax({ 'url': 'localhost/laravel/public/index.php', 'data': { 'page': 2 }, 'success': function(data) {
[05:55:14] <JovanJ> 'url' should be an url where posts will display or?
[05:56:22] <sahbeewah> in your scenario, yes
[05:57:34] <sahbeewah> you may need to do more reading first if you don't understand ajax and network requests
[05:57:38] <sahbeewah> it's kind of fundamental
[05:58:55] <JovanJ> thank you
[06:01:05] <Ericx2x> Hey guys, I need help with drawing out buttons on this slider I'm using. I need the buttons to look like this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12883232/buttons.png
[06:01:10] <Ericx2x> but they currently look like this: http://adapt.erictheprogrammer.com/
[06:01:27] <Ericx2x> i think the buttons are being drawn in jquery / javascript
[06:01:40] <Ericx2x> i'm not sure how I would edit the JS to make the buttons look like the image
[06:05:42] <sahbeewah> Ericx2x, it's not being drawn in js... it's an image
[06:05:49] <JovanJ> sahbeewah: did you ever used this plugin?  https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[06:06:00] <sahbeewah> a sprite-map, background image, to be precise
[06:06:20] <sahbeewah> JovanJ, nope
[06:08:41] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah Really? I tried editing all the images and they don't work
[06:08:57] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah Can you find the image?
[06:09:21] <sahbeewah> http://adapt.erictheprogrammer.com/css/icons.png
[06:09:40] <Ericx2x> i tried editing that
[06:09:44] <Ericx2x> and nothing happened
[06:10:18] <Ericx2x> i just renamed the file and still nothing happens
[06:10:33] <Ericx2x> it's still the same slider buttons
[06:12:19] <sahbeewah> don't know what to tell ya
[06:12:27] <sahbeewah> refresh your cache
[06:12:31] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah are you sure that it is grabing the image?
[06:12:34] <Ericx2x> ok
[06:12:52] <sahbeewah> make sure ur modifying the right file
[06:12:59] <sahbeewah> make sure you're using the right server
[06:14:02] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah okay some confusion here: the arrows on that image file correlate to the arrows on the site
[06:14:05] <Ericx2x> not the buttons
[06:14:14] <Ericx2x> the button are being drawn in Jquery/JS I think
[06:14:36] <DevAntoine> hi
[06:14:41] <DevAntoine> is there some jqgrid users out there?
[06:14:45] <Ericx2x> so if i rename the file and refresh my cache the arrows dissapear not the buttons
[06:15:43] <Ericx2x> notice if you right-click the arrows you can view background iamge
[06:15:52] <Ericx2x> but if you rightclick the buttons it doesn't allow you to do that
[06:16:37] <sahbeewah> no i don't notice that
[06:17:14] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah right click on the arrows and you can view background iamge
[06:17:20] <Ericx2x> right click on the dots and you cna't
[06:17:21] <Ericx2x> can't*
[06:18:21] <sahbeewah> that right-click behaviour will be browser/os dependent
[06:18:44] <sahbeewah> anyway it was using that sprite sheet, but it's also using a border radius on a div fallback
[06:19:23] <sahbeewah> tran.css:128
[06:20:17] <Ericx2x> yea
[06:20:26] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah i commented those out and the dots are now squares
[06:20:43] <Ericx2x> oh whops i edited the .js file
[06:20:44] <Ericx2x> sec
[06:21:02] <Ericx2x> nevermind it was the .css
[06:21:28] <Ericx2x> i edited that line and the dots are squares
[06:21:50] <Ericx2x> are you sure its being rendered from the image file or is it being rendered from the css or js file?
[06:23:42] <sahbeewah> it's using the css
[06:24:57] <rzec_> is it possible to stop jQuery from caching DOM objects (which ultimately is probably sizzle)?  I am getting a bunch of detached dom elements when profiling my page and I want to verify whether or not it is jQuery
[06:27:00] <Cork> rzec_: jquery doesn't cache dom elements
[06:27:23] <Cork> rzec_: if you get leaked elements, you are using variables that you are keeping around
[06:28:41] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah is it possible for me to edit the CSS to make it look like thos button in that picture/
[06:30:37] <Wolf_22> Are there any issues with IE9 concerning addClass and removeClass for the "this" object? I've attached a click event to a link. (I'm using it to control a tiny menu for users.) When clicked, there's some logic that uses the "this" keyword that determines whether a CSS class needs to be attached. Everything works in IE9 except the addClass and removeClass: the classes aren't removed from...
[06:30:39] <Wolf_22> ..."this"--it's ignored. Thoughts?
[06:31:30] <Cork> Wolf_22: nope, add/removeClass works fine in ie
[06:31:38] <sahbeewah> Ericx2x, given that you can create svg files using base64 encoding, as with a whole bunch of other css tricks, you can pretty much make any image in css
[06:31:47] <sahbeewah> you'd have to know how, and it's also not worth it
[06:31:51] <sahbeewah> use images
[06:32:06] <Ericx2x> sahbeewah
[06:32:14] <Ericx2x> i'm not quite sure how to use images instead
[06:32:24] <Ericx2x> i don't really understand how this slider is working
[06:35:17] <sahbeewah> well your step 1 should be to figure that out
[06:35:29] <sahbeewah> read through the plugin
[06:36:22] <JovanJ> Is this good defined <script> for plugin?  http://paste.laravel.com/Y7S
[06:48:31] <Acrack> hi
[06:50:13] <JovanJ> Did someone used this plugin? http://www.infinite-scroll.com/infinite-scroll-jquery-plugin/
[06:50:22] <Acrack> how i can select the li with an id ? : http://jsfiddle.net/SLqXb/
[06:50:38] <Acrack> and append in the selected <li> "online"
[06:51:30] <Ericx2x> Question: I was given a JS slider library the requires a license from my client
[06:51:33] <jedimind> li#id { something }
[06:51:36] <Ericx2x> my client used this slider on a previous website
[06:51:51] <Ericx2x> Is it required to buy the license?
[06:51:52] <Cork> Ericx2x: are you talking about a slider or a slideshow?
[06:52:01] <jedimind> Ericx2x depends on his license
[06:52:04] <Ericx2x> slider
[06:52:05] <jedimind> if its a one domain license, then no
[06:52:09] <Ericx2x> http://codecanyon.net/item/translucent-responsive-banner-rotator-slider/801607
[06:52:25] <jedimind> says it right on that page Ericx2x
[06:52:33] <jedimind> Regular License
[06:52:33] <jedimind> Use, by you or one client, in a single end product
[06:52:50] <Ericx2x> so I have to purchase this license again?
[06:52:54] <Cork> Ericx2x: uh.. that's a slideshow not a slider
[06:52:56] <Ericx2x> or my client does
[06:53:05] <Cork> Ericx2x: that depends on the license
[06:54:07] <Cork> Ericx2x: http://codecanyon.net/licenses
[06:54:55] <jedimind> Ericx2x its a standard license defined on the plugin page
[06:55:00] <jedimind> that states its for single usage
[06:55:02] <Acrack> jedimind:         $('.online-friends li#' + userId).append('lol'); this isn't working for this : http://jsfiddle.net/SLqXb/
[06:55:05] <Ericx2x> yea
[06:55:09] <jedimind> Acrack why are you telling me ?
[06:55:18] <Ericx2x> the thing is I have an older version of this slider that I'm trying to work off of
[06:55:24] <Ericx2x> I'm not sure if I update it that it will work
[06:55:34] <jedimind> Acrack because youre setting a class, not an ID ?
[06:55:34] <Acrack> jedimind: cause you answered me previously xD
[06:55:34] <Acrack> li#id { something }
[06:55:34] <Acrack> jedimind @ 15:51
[06:55:50] <jedimind> you have class="{id}" instead of id="{id}
[06:55:53] <Cork> Ericx2x: the license will be in action as long as you use there slideshow lib
[06:56:00] <Cork> Ericx2x: modifying it won't help you
[06:56:21] <Ericx2x> This isn't a question about the license
[06:56:27] <Ericx2x> I know I need to buy it
[06:56:41] <Ericx2x> but if I purcahse this license and it igves me the updated version it may not work right
[06:56:44] <Cork> then why are you asking about the license?
[06:56:47] <Acrack> ah ok :x
[06:56:51] <Ericx2x> old question
[06:57:01] <Cork> Ericx2x: well ya
[06:57:09] <Cork> but you need to ask them that
[06:57:43] <Ericx2x> Well, does anyone know of an alternative for this kind of slider? http://adapt.erictheprogrammer.com/
[06:57:55] <Cork> Ericx2x: again use the correct term
[06:57:59] <Cork> it is a slideshow
[06:58:07] <Cork> a slider is something like ex. http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/
[06:58:27] <Cork> or the native html slider
[06:59:11] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets#Sliders
[06:59:27] <Ericx2x> okay
[06:59:37] <Ericx2x> is there some way I can download this updated slider without purcahsing it?
[06:59:40] <Ericx2x> so I can simply test it out
[06:59:46] <Ericx2x> before I decide if it works or not
[06:59:49] <Cork> there are hundreds of slideshows out there, just google jquery slideshow
[07:00:04] <Cork> Ericx2x: most likely not
[07:00:08] <Cork> but again ask them
[07:00:24] <rzec_> does anyone know if there is a know jquery 2 bug for dom leaks, when I run an application and switch from page to page 60 times, jQuery 2 timeline shows 61k+ dom element but jquery 1.10 shows 12k+, just wondering if I need to report this on github?
[07:01:12] <Cork> rzec_: is it page load or ajax load?
[07:07:52] <wild_oscar> I have a client who wishes to include the tablesorter plugin into displaytag (a jsp tag for displaying tables) automatically. this, however, means, that for the jsp to generate javascript code (even just a simple initialisation on ready), that code will not be in the beginning or end of the html page, but wherever the table starts to be rendered
[07:08:06] <wild_oscar> isn't this kind of a bad practise?
[07:11:27] <riseman> sup guys
[07:11:41] <rzec_> Cork: ajax based load (using AngularJS)
[07:14:57] <riseman> How can I access this http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=library.getartists&api_key=ed1c3db1d5a638052774b7a5abe74bba&user=riseman&limit=5&format=json and make a list of each artist? Im trying to understand this json thing

[07:43:02] <grafi> what does the checkbox do? ^^
[07:43:07] <grafi> when you check it
[07:43:13] <grafi> adding it is not a problem
[07:43:35] <riseman> the checkbox just stays there haha
[07:43:53] <riseman> so that the next time I load the page I know that i've got those albums and i'm still missing the others
[07:44:10] <riseman> so that may involve some kind of saving stuff to the server
[07:44:30] <riseman> or writing to the json file? is that possible?
[07:45:04] <riseman> or a way that does not involve creating a db just for doing that
[07:45:17] <JovanJ> Does anyone have some experience with infinte scroll plugins?
[07:45:42] <grafi> riseman hm, finding the easy solution could be hard :P
[07:46:09] <BillCriswell> Solutions suck.
[07:46:17] <grafi> Find more problems?
[07:46:17] <grafi> :P
[07:46:56] <BillCriswell> That's the idea!
[07:48:51] <BillCriswell> I'm at a conference right now. The title of the presentation is not matching up with what I expected.
[07:50:21] <grafi> oô
[07:50:25] <grafi> whats the title?
[07:50:43] <grafi> also: any photoshop ninjas able to tell me how to move points of a path oô
[07:51:26] <jamesch> Hi, is it possible to have a selector which selects the child of a parent with an id which is matched with ^=?
[07:52:01] <jamesch> nvm. figured it out.
[07:52:09] <grafi> that was quick
[07:58:13] <riseman> grafi: i'm playing around with this this, it's pretty cool http://faunadiseno.com/rise/
[07:59:00] <riseman> now i'll sort it
[07:59:27] <grafi> This is the list of the music i have to get back.
[07:59:28] <grafi> woot
[07:59:30] <grafi> ^^
[07:59:39] <grafi> ah, its loading stuff xD
[08:00:00] <grafi> riseman so the lastfm list wont be changing right?
[08:00:19] <grafi> so you could technically save that to a file?
[08:00:19] <riseman> grafi: what do you mean?
[08:00:35] <riseman> ah yeah, i've made a artists.js file
[08:01:20] <grafi> so the checkbox could possibly add another property to the artist
[08:01:34] <grafi> and you could save your progress to the file
[08:01:46] <grafi> next time you load it up the checkbox would then be selected
[08:02:26] <riseman> that's exactly what i was thinking but im not sure if its possible to do so
[08:02:38] <grafi> should be relatively easy
[08:02:45] <grafi> lemme see
[08:02:49] <riseman> awesome
[08:03:03] <riseman> I added the plays, and i'm trying to add a thumbnail so it doesnt look thaaat sad haha
[08:03:10] <grafi> xP
[08:03:25] <grafi> cool think is the thumbnails are alrady in the json ^^
[08:03:29] <grafi> *thing
[08:03:34] <riseman> yup
[08:04:16] <riseman> dont know how to actually get them cause they're inside another object and i get lost pretty easy
[08:04:30] <riseman> lastfm api looks really cool
[08:04:42] <grafi> json is really easy
[08:06:10] <grafi> all the artist object have another object in them named image
[08:06:17] <grafi> thats where the images go
[08:06:30] <riseman> exactlty, and inside image you have different sizes
[08:06:50] <grafi> try searching json pretty print on google, and insert the json you get, structured its a lot more obvious to see whats going on
[08:07:29] <riseman> aaah cool
[08:07:37] <riseman> i was looking at the xml version hehe
[08:09:58] <grafi> riseman http://jsfiddle.net/Ac8Fw/1/ :P
[08:12:42] <riseman> i was far away from getting the image haha
[08:13:55] <riseman> grafi: so what's the mbid data for?
[08:14:09] <grafi> for later
[08:14:47] <grafi> when you check a checkbox i can go into the artists look for the mbid (hoping that its an actual id :P) and find the corresponding artist, to add an "isChecked"
[08:15:00] <grafi> when you are finished with a session, you can click output json
[08:15:09] <grafi> get new json to put in your js file
[08:15:21] <grafi> next session its loads the upadted json
[08:15:32] <riseman> wow, that sounds really cool
[08:15:33] <grafi> and the checkboxes that were checked should be already checked
[08:15:43] <grafi> apart from the whole manual saving to file
[08:15:49] <grafi> :P
[08:15:50] <zizzl> Hey guys, trying to learn jQuery here.. I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vt7rx/1/ which works but I'd like to minify my code if possible. I put in the html as well to show you what I'm doing but basically I have a hover on the address icon which puts a class on the hover address in another div
[08:15:52] <riseman> and no messing with cookies and funny stuff
[08:16:21] <riseman> you're really cool man :) thanks a lot for helping me out and build this thing
[08:16:38] <grafi> no problem :P
[08:24:06] <__equinox> i have the following route

[08:24:43] <__equinox> how do I do so?

[08:24:59] <willbeeler> hi everyone, i know this is not exactly a jquery question.. but i was here a little bit ago and i was wondering.. I'm using chrome on Linux (xubuntu), and is there a way to see things that I dynamically create with jquery?
[08:25:45] <willbeeler> i know about the console
[08:26:52] <wild_oscar> willbeeler: such as?
[08:28:24] <Mrono> I'm having an issue where .on("change") is not working for dynamicly inserted checkboxes
[08:28:43] <Mrono> i'm inserting them with $('<input />', { type: 'checkbox', value: value }).appendTo(container);
[08:28:51] <kelsadita> Hi all I am getting this error in an ajax request ..
[08:28:53] <willbeeler> @wild_oscar: what do you mean? I'm asking if there's  a way to see dynamically created content like $("#something").html("this is some content");
[08:28:54] <kelsadita> Blocked a frame with origin "https://www.abs.com" from accessing a frame with origin "null". The frame requesting access has a protocol of "https", the frame being accessed has a protocol of "data". Protocols must match.
[08:29:03] <willbeeler> in html
[08:29:13] <willbeeler> as if i were creating it normally
[08:30:20] <willbeeler> nevermind, i think i found something
[08:30:24] <willbeeler> DOM inspector for  chrome
[08:30:24] <zizzl> Hey guys, trying to learn jQuery here.. I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vt7rx/1/ which works but I'd like to minify my code if possible. I put in the html as well to show you what I'm doing but basically I have a hover on the address icon which puts a class on the hover address in another div...
[08:30:54] <zizzl> I just have repeating code, wondering how to somehow just run that code once and tell it to use matching classes or something
[08:32:00] <grafi> riseman http://jsfiddle.net/Ac8Fw/3/ something like this, it adds the isChecked property to the json
[08:32:16] <grafi> riseman have to go now, be back in a few hours though ;) cya
[08:32:49] <riseman> grafi: looking very nice!! See ya later, good luck!
[08:32:49] <Quest> can anyone please visit http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/login   with admin@admin.com:admin then   http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/boards/3     .     the black drop down arrow of newly created box (by ajax in dom, if you hit white arrow> create box, fill form, hit submit)  drop down menu of black arrow is not formated same as the static box

[08:37:12] <kelsadita> why am I getting this error
[08:42:03] <antoine> is there a way to capture a dom element add in jquery ?
[08:42:54] <Mrono> http://jsfiddle.net/8PQvf/1/
[08:43:52] <Quest> can anyone please visit http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/login   with admin@admin.com:admin then   http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/boards/3     .     the black drop down arrow of newly created box (by ajax in dom, if you hit white arrow> create box, fill form, hit submit)  drop down menu of black arrow is not formated same as the static box
[08:43:53] <Quest> http://i42.tinypic.com/2n8u6ht.png       the left one is newly created dom element "box" is broken menu. it has the same class for styling and same jquery as of the right one but the right one was loaded at page load. static.
[08:44:24] <antoine> Mrono, I don't need to add, I need to capture when a dom element is added.
[08:44:48] <Mrono> antoine: sorry, that was a fiddle of my problem
[08:45:02] <antoine> Mrono, :) sorry for this also
[08:45:10] <antoine> Mrono, if I can help ?
[08:45:38] <mikecmpbll> Mrono: you're applying the event to the checkboxes that exist
[08:46:11] <mikecmpbll> you need to apply it to the container like: $(".list").on('change', 'input:checkbox', function() { ...
[08:46:13] <Mrono> mikecmpbll: yes, how do I also apply it to the ones I dynamicly generate
[08:46:27] <Mrono> hmm
[08:46:31] <mikecmpbll> so that the event is attached to the list and applies to all input:checkbox in that list
[08:46:46] <Mrono> so it does
[08:46:50] <Mrono> mikecmpbll: thanks
[08:47:09] <mikecmpbll> no problem. be as specific as you can in the first selector, for better performance
[08:47:44] <mikecmpbll> you could do something like $('body').on('change', '.list input:checkbox', function() {.. but it wouldn't be as quick,
[08:49:16] <antoine> Mrono, http://jsfiddle.net/8PQvf/1/ does this help now ?
[08:50:21] <antoine> Mrono, sorry my bad, let me edit a new one and send it back

[08:54:41] <antoine> Mrono, did this help you  ?
[08:59:18] <kelsadita> when do we get this error Blocked a frame with origin

[09:47:41] <serversides> Hey guys I have a simple image slideshow using fadein, fadeout, only problem is that it wont fadein the next image smoothly, any soloutions? Here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/8JnuD/
[09:49:15] <Syrit> Guys, can any one tell me please, why the if statement is always evaluating to true ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2fe8e95db2cd4ebe578d
[09:51:12] <shoky> Syrit: looks like chk_box is a jquery object, so use .val()  not .value
[09:51:29] <Syrit> i will try that shoky
[09:51:44] <shoky> though you didn't really show what chk_box is
[09:52:18] <Syrit> var chk_box = $('<input name="contact_ids[]" type="checkbox" value="'+this._id+'" >'+name+'</option><br />');
[09:52:23] <Syrit> shoky ^^
[09:52:26] <shoky> nor any reason why you would expect the if to be true
[09:52:45] <shoky> Syrit yes that's a jquery object
[09:52:48] <Syrit> yes
[09:52:52] <shoky> they don't have .value properties
[09:52:58] <Syrit> i see
[09:53:06] <Syrit> and i don't want it to evaluate to true shoky
[09:53:20] <Syrit> i am populating checkboxes dynamically
[09:53:22] <shoky> ok i meant false
[09:53:35] <Syrit> but the pages might come with already checked ckboxes
[09:53:41] <shoky> i don't see any of that, do i
[09:53:45] <Syrit> no
[09:53:46] <Syrit> :D
[09:53:48] <shoky> ;p
[09:53:51] <Syrit> i am trying to explain :D
[09:53:59] <Syrit> if you are interrested
[09:54:00] <serversides> Sorry guys, any idea why my slideshow isnt fading in and out smoothly? http://jsfiddle.net/8JnuD/
[09:54:00] <shoky> explanation won't show me what you're doing wrong
[09:54:19] <shoky> but anyway, see if .val() fixes it for ya..
[09:54:42] <jedimind> serversides http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/slideshow.gif

[09:56:43] <shoky> gregf_: is it a cross-origin ajax call? ie8 needs something special for that
[09:57:39] <shoky> well ie9 too actually, iirc
[10:16:08] <gregf_> shoky: really sorry
[10:16:22] <gregf_> was away in a meeting
[10:16:32] <gregf_> no, its the same origin
[10:17:52] <gregf_> shoky: whats would ie8 need to make an ajax call
[10:18:49] <gregf_> it works in ff, chrome, ie 10 :/
[10:27:23] <jphase> gregf_: you have any errors in your console on IE8 ?
[10:30:57] <shoky> gregf_: for a cross-origin request you'd need to include the xdr transport https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[10:35:00] <Quest> vwell made a fiddle too. http://jsfiddle.net/CLYHW/
[10:37:48] <jedimind> sort of
[10:37:53] <jedimind> Quest whats the probleM?
[10:38:13] <jedimind> why did you just throw everything into the html pane
[10:38:20] <talntid> $('select[data-agent-id!="63" name!="StateID"]:first')
[10:38:51] <talntid> returns: the selectbox with name="StateID". shouldn't, right?
[10:38:54] <Quest> jedimind,  reduced http://jsfiddle.net/CLYHW/1/
[10:39:03] <Quest> jedimind,   just click the white arrow. create box. submit. the new black arrow of box is not the same as of the box which was loaded with page
[10:39:21] <Quest> jedimind,  for full detail http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19323383/jquery-libs-not-available-effecting-on-code-in-document-ready-block
[10:39:23] <gregf_> shoky: i managed to get it to work in ie8 :)
[10:39:59] <gregf_> shoky: contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", <== included this in the ajax call
[10:43:27] <petey> Does someone mind looking over this? Typical JQuery tabs, but I'd like, once you click one of the tabs, for the background to change on the other tabs. I can't figure it out http://jsbin.com/eGEWOje/1/
[10:43:43] <petey> so when you click on experience for example, experience turns green, but I want the other 3 tabs to turn gray
[10:44:02] <petey> I'm not sure if I should use a for loop for that, using for :not:current?
[10:45:36] <gregf_> shoky: thanks!
[10:46:53] <mdev> how can I read a data attribute inside of a callback
[10:47:00] <mdev> this.data('blah') not working

[10:48:49] <partyQuery> Morning/afternoon. I don't have code for this, but I hope i can describe this well. I'm working on a website that has a menu on the left, and a scrollable view on the right. When I scroll up or down, I want the active chapter on the left menu to be highlighted. Is there a plugin that would meet that need?
[10:49:17] <mdev> nevermind found it
[10:49:28] <mdev> $(this).attr("data-msg")
[10:50:34] <shoky> gregf_: any idea why that fixes it?
[10:51:24] <partyQuery> If it will help clarify, URLs will not be used to set active chapters. It's purely the scroll location on the right.
[10:56:59] <Wanfu> is .load() supposed to be async, because it is holding up loading the rest of my page until it is finished
[11:01:55] <Jon471> wanfu - can you show us an example?
[11:03:31] <petey> I would like to have the selected tab to turn green and every other tab to turn gray
[11:03:33] <petey> but for some reason I can't get it working
[11:04:25] <bigLanky> add a class to it
[11:04:28] <bigLanky> class="active"
[11:04:30] <bigLanky> then use css
[11:04:40] <petey> how do I add a class to the opposite tabs?
[11:04:48] <petey> I tried using :not but it only works for the first one
[11:04:59] <bigLanky> you dont need classes on the other tabs
[11:05:01] <bigLanky> just the active tab
[11:05:42] <petey> http://jsbin.com/eGEWOje/1/
[11:06:02] <petey> At first all the tabs are red which is fine, then when you click a tab, the background for the selected tab should turn green (works) and the rest should turn gray (only works first time around)
[11:06:19] <petey> Once you click to the other tab, they all just turn gray
[11:08:47] <otiuk> how can i stop jquery mobile from auto-initializing for a whole page and then just have it initialize say just one form with a certain id?
[11:09:03] <petey> Nevermind, I got it. thanks
[11:11:44] <duch_kazatel> otiuk i don't know that you can - why use the whole lib if you just want to use it on a form?
[11:14:03] <Quest> solved =  http://jsfiddle.net/CLYHW/3/          thanks to ALL for great help!
[11:18:40] <Wanfu> I am trying to load in a bunch of thumbnails in a sidebar (about 30 of them) and the rest of the page doesnt load, until its done the .load() to load in the images
[11:19:59] <Wanfu> Jon471, so I dont hve an example, as its part of my system back end, its not public
[11:22:26] <Jon471> wanfu it's not really convenient to debug it in theory
[11:22:35] <Jon471> much easier with a concrete example
[11:24:30] <Wanfu> Jon471, obviously.. but is .load() supposed to be async?
[11:25:03] <JovanJ> Is there some usefull guide how to install jQuery plugins?
[11:28:50] <crankharder> can I animate adding a class if that class only adds new left values?
[11:28:51] <otiuk> duch_kazatel: well we use a slim downed version of jquery mobile just for the form elements.. the problem is now we'd like to retain that styling on non-mobile .. but jquery mobile just takes everything over.. so want to calm it down
[11:29:35] <otiuk> what i'd love is to find a quick framework that provided the nice mobile functioning/styled form elements minus all the other stuff for both mobile and desktop
[11:33:32] <_rgn> nothing really prevents you from removing the stuff you don't need
[11:34:04] <mdev> I pull a string from the db to store in a data-blah it keeps saying JSON.parse unexpected character, the datas returned back as json
[11:34:15] <mdev> nevermind i have no question
[11:34:46] <m8> Hi, $.post("", {}, null, "json").fail(function() {alert("KO"}) why fail is always called?
[11:44:41] <mink> Hi guys. I've problem with jQuery UI Drag&Drop
[11:45:24] <mink> When I dragging element, I initialize droppable on elements where I want drop item.
[11:45:46] <mink> And drop event actually work all right, but problem is with "dragover" and "dragout" events
[11:49:11] <phrearch> hi
[11:50:27] <willbeeler> hi everyone, can someone help me do this? should be pretty simple.. When you click the "Delete" button in this example, it should make the Upload Image Button appear again. Basically, it needs to traverse upwards and find the Upload image.. I'm kinda lost on this.. dunno why it's not working.  http://jsfiddle.net/J5KC6/3/
[11:50:47] <willbeeler> **Upload image should be Upload Button
[11:51:21] <willbeeler> **Edit: i don't know why MY code on my dev server isn't working... This code I am showing you isn't working because I need help :)
[11:51:33] <willbeeler> and I didn't include all my other stuff that I've tried
[11:52:10] <phrearch> $('.up_img_btn').show() ?
[11:52:29] <willbeeler> uh no.. because there's others in this list.. and it doesn't know exactly which one to show
[11:52:50] <willbeeler> i need soemthing like this: jQuery(this).parent().children(".up_img_btn").show();
[11:52:56] <willbeeler> **Jquery = $
[11:53:07] <punter> What's the right way to check whether an element is in the HTML or whether it's just in a variable of mine?
[11:53:19] <phrearch> but up_img_btn is a sibling
[11:53:35] <phrearch> like .parent().next().next() or something
[11:53:42] <willbeeler> so it should be sibling.().show();
[11:53:47] <willbeeler> oh.. ok 1 sec
[11:53:48] <phrearch> something like that
[11:54:14] <punter> in the current webpage I mean
[11:54:39] <phrearch> http://jsfiddle.net/J5KC6/4/
[11:54:40] <punter> maybe by checking whether document is a member of element.parents() ?
[11:55:22] <phrearch> punter $(selector).length ?
[11:55:53] <phrearch> i($(selector).length == 0) {console.log('not there (yet)');}
[11:56:10] <punter> phrearch: I'm not wondering whether a SELECTOR is in the webpage, but whether a specific element object
[11:56:30] <willbeeler> @phrearch: DUDE YOU ROCK!
[11:56:40] <phrearch> willbeeler: glad it works :-)
[11:56:45] <willbeeler> thanks!
[11:56:48] <phrearch> sure np
[11:57:14] <phrearch> punter: isnt length the amount of element objects returned from the selector?
[11:57:21] <punter> phrearch: var el = $(selector); [then an AJAX may or may not have removed that very element from the webpage]; IS el still in the page?
[11:57:55] <punter> phrearch: Probably it is, but I'm wondering whether THAT SAME element still existst here. Not a copy of it.
[11:57:57] <phrearch> punter: you probably need to query it again before you check?
[11:58:08] <phrearch> ah ok
[11:58:10] <punter> phrearch: No. I want THE SAME element
[11:58:33] <punter> How do I check whether an element (not a selector) is in the current document?
[11:58:42] <mdev> how do I properly escape/format a string for javascript?
[11:59:03] <phrearch> i dont know how you can distinguish one unique element and an exact copy if it
[11:59:16] <phrearch> maybe give it a timestamp attribute, dunno sorry
[11:59:20] <punter> phrearch: How about by checking whether .parents() contains document?
[11:59:35] <phrearch> punter: what are you trying to do in the first place?
[12:00:30] <phrearch> if you want an event handler on a selector, you could use a delegate
[12:00:36] <punter> phrearch: I'm writing an AngularJS directive, that creates a setInterval, and I want that setInterval gone if the very same element is gone from the page
[12:01:08] <punter> What do you think of checking whether .parents() contains document?
[12:01:54] <punter> phrearch: I'm writing a directive that sets the model equal to el.val() (ideal for autofilled usernames & passwords)
[12:02:23] <phrearch> sounds more like an angularjs problem to me
[12:02:24] <punter> phrearch: it sets it every 1 second (for the case that lastpass fills it in for you, after 2 seconds)
[12:02:31] <punter> No, it's a jQuery problem
[12:02:34] <punter> What do you think of checking whether .parents() contains document?
[12:02:35] <punter> What do you think of checking whether .parents() contains document?
[12:02:36] <punter> What do you think of checking whether .parents() contains document?
[12:02:54] <jedimind> maybe if you ask one more time, that'll help
[12:03:01] <phrearch> :-)
[12:03:53] <phrearch> i never really understood angularjs anyway
[12:04:01] <jedimind> whats there to (not) understand?
[12:04:07] <jedimind> like why does it exist
[12:04:09] <otiuk> so there is no way to just initialize jquery to just elements in a specified div?
[12:04:29] <phrearch> i don't like how it tries to move away from the dom
[12:04:41] <jedimind> why phrearch
[12:04:47] <jedimind> and how is it moving away from the dom
[12:04:50] <rmah> otiuk: huh?
[12:05:02] <NoiseEee> punter: if you're using angular, you should do your best not to use jquery.
[12:05:24] <graphettion> anyone know any js graph charts that are good that you have experienced?
[12:05:32] <modestkdr> why does replacing jQuery("li") with selector.skuList throw an error? http://jsfiddle.net/5hgJb/
[12:05:36] <graphettion> I'd rather have feedback than just grab one on google
[12:05:50] <punter> NoiseEee: AngularJS programmers are expected to use jQuery, and heavilly, when creating directives. Which is what I'm trying to do,.
[12:05:53] <otiuk> rmah, i only want jquery mobile to stylize elements within a given div not the whole page
[12:06:00] <jedimind> graphettion i havent used it personally, but http://www.chartjs.org/
[12:06:01] <jedimind> looks sexy
[12:06:10] <jedimind> punter no they're not ?
[12:06:16] <punter> Yes they are
[12:06:17] <jedimind> jqlite != jquery
[12:06:23] <NoiseEee> punter: you're totally wrong
[12:06:25] <bberry> hey jquery. okay so ive been using mootools for my ajax calls, specifically getting JSON strings and turning those into objects.  The nice feature i like about it is the onSucess, onFailure, and onError callback functions that you can define.  Is there something similar in jquery?
[12:06:26] <graphettion> jedimind: thanks dawg
[12:06:37] <punter> no I'm not wong, NoiseEee
[12:06:50] <jedimind> bberry absolutely
[12:06:53] <punter> jqlite, jquery whatever. If you load jQuery before angular, then you can use jQuery instead.
[12:06:53] <graphettion> jedimind: link isn't working
[12:07:00] <jedimind> graphettion lies
[12:07:04] <NoiseEee> punter: which defeats the point of using angular
[12:07:08] <graphettion> jedimind: not for me at least
[12:07:13] <jedimind> graphettion works for me
[12:07:17] <NoiseEee> punter: i'd ask for sensible advice in #angularjs
[12:07:28] <jedimind> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/chartjs.com
[12:07:30] <graphettion> jedimind: Weird, even googled it
[12:07:31] <rmah> modestkdr: because selector.skuList resolves to the string 'jQuery("li")' not jQuery("li")
[12:07:47] <phrearch> jedimind: just a personal opinion. reactive stuff is nice, but it makes things more complicated if you want something to work otherwise then the framework dictates
[12:07:48] <punter> All I'm looking to find out is: how do you check whether an element is in the document. That's got nothing to do with angular
[12:07:49] <graphettion> jedimind: haha, user error
[12:07:56] <graphettion> jedimind: I'll check later, thanks man
[12:08:04] <modestkdr> rmah: how can I change it from string to a selector?
[12:08:15] <jedimind> phrearch i find the opposite true, i find that a lot of people who code with jquery tend to write behaviour-based directives
[12:08:16] <rmah> modestkdr: what you want to do is replace 'jQuery("li")' with just "li" and then use: jQuery(selector.skuList).each...
[12:08:19] <NoiseEee> punter: if($(someElement).length===0) { //not there }
[12:08:30] <rmah> modestkdr: see the difference?
[12:08:30] <jedimind> where as angular js is more structure and closer to an MV* model
[12:08:46] <rmah> jedimind: does that make it better?
[12:08:55] <jedimind> does what make what better?
[12:09:02] <modestkdr> rmah: yes, but I am trying to cache the jQuery selections
[12:09:13] <jedimind> does that make angularjs better than jquery you mean ?
[12:09:19] <jedimind> apples and oranges imo
[12:09:26] <phrearch> yea not comparable
[12:09:38] <rmah> modestkdr: oh, then do: selector = { skuList: jQuery("li") }
[12:09:50] <Ericx2x> Anyone here have a portfolio that they show to clients or on job interviews?
[12:09:56] <jedimind> yes
[12:09:58] <rmah> and then selector.skuList.each(...)
[12:10:05] <punter> NoiseEee: Do you mean 'selector' instead of 'someElement' ?
[12:10:11] <Ericx2x> jedimind can I see your portfolio to get ideas?
[12:10:14] <jedimind> nope
[12:10:17] <jedimind> creattica.com go there for ideas
[12:10:18] <NoiseEee> punter: yep
[12:10:21] <jedimind> or dribbble
[12:10:21] <rmah> modestkdr: but be aware that selector.skuList will be static at that point and will not update itself as the document changes
[12:10:28] <jedimind> or, not me
[12:10:28] <jedimind> :)
[12:10:29] <rmah> modestkdr: I strongly suggest you do not do that
[12:10:31] <Ericx2x> ok thanks
[12:10:40] <Ericx2x> just curious why are you afraid to show your portfolio?
[12:10:52] <jedimind> im not
[12:11:11] <punter> NoiseEee: But I'm not looking to find out whether a selector exists, but whether a jquery element exists
[12:11:11] <Ericx2x> so what reason don't you want to show it?
[12:11:14] <jedimind> fear doesnt play into it at all
[12:11:15] <rmah> modestkdr: unlike SQL databases, there are no separate prepare/execute phases for jquery selectors
[12:11:21] <phrearch> anyone happens to know the selector code for a script tag that has a src attribute? O:-)
[12:11:25] <graphettion> jedimind: Caught you in a lie
[12:11:30] <graphettion> jedimind: You sent .org
[12:11:31] <NoiseEee> punter: "a jquery element" is what?
[12:11:34] <graphettion> jedimind: then .com
[12:11:35] <jedimind> graphettion oh shit
[12:11:39] <graphettion> hehe
[12:11:42] * jedimind hides
[12:11:47] <graphettion> jedimind: np, I'm just jk
[12:11:51] <graphettion> You rock
[12:11:51] <graphettion> ty
[12:11:56] <jedimind> Ericx2x because its not current and i dont publicly show it off any more
[12:11:58] <NoiseEee> punter: if the result of your selector is 0, then there are no items in the DOM that match your selector.
[12:12:02] <modestkdr> rmah: I am using the cached selector as part of a function. I call the functions as needed so, I think I should be ok in terms of getting any updates right?
[12:12:11] <rmah> no
[12:12:12] <jedimind> also i dont try to get a job as a designer any more, and my resume > my portfolio
[12:12:15] <NoiseEee> punter: if the result of your selector *length* is 0, then there are no items in the DOM that match your selector.
[12:12:18] <phrearch> something like $("script [src^='*']")
[12:12:47] <rmah> modestkdr: you are over-complicating things.  $("li") will run VERY fast
[12:13:10] <rmah> unless you have to execute it hundreds of times a second, there will be no user-noticeable impact
[12:14:09] <modestkdr> rmah: well, overall I will have about 20 to 30 selections and I thought it would be clean to store all jQuery selections in an object and use them as variables in my functions
[12:14:32] <modestkdr> 20 to 30 selections in my app ..
[12:14:53] <rmah> modestkdr: I understood your goals as soon as I saw your code
[12:15:05] <bberry> jedimind: I looked at the $.ajax() fxn and see that i can send a JSON string that way.   There is a success callback, but i dont see anything for a onError or onFailure...  Suggestions?
[12:15:15] <modestkdr> rmah: but, you don't want me to cache jQuery selections?
[12:15:34] <rmah> modestkdr: as I said, if you're sure the result won't change, then it's fine
[12:15:36] <bberry> jedimind: nevermind, im an idiot
[12:15:51] * jedimind hugs bberry 
[12:15:52] <jedimind> its okay buddy
[12:15:53] <rmah> but if the result is expected to change (which it looks like it might with something like getSkus) then you probably don't want to
[12:16:02] <jedimind> bberry there's also load()
[12:16:22] <bberry> okay, ill check that out too
[12:16:25] <bberry> thanks :D
[12:16:35] <modestkdr> rmah: thanks
[12:18:27] <phrearch> hm that was easier than i thought, just check $(this).attr('src') in .each :p
[12:36:25] <willbeeler> is there a way to find errors when something doesnt' work
[12:36:53] <willbeeler> im clicking on a button that was working a few mintues ago, and now it doesn't work..
[12:38:08] <willbeeler> anyone?
[12:38:29] <jedimind> console?
[12:43:41] <willbeeler> nevermind i figured it out
[12:49:38] <grafi> so riseman did you get any further?
[12:49:58] <riseman> hey!
[12:50:05] <riseman> grafi: check this out http://faunadiseno.com/rise/
[12:50:37] <riseman> it's kinda slow because of the 1.9mb file and the pictures, but at least it looks kinda nice
[12:50:50] <grafi> looking very nice
[12:50:51] <grafi> :P
[12:52:21] <willbeeler> another question
[12:52:27] <Criten> question about touch screen browser... when i tap on a .click event it doesnt seem to always fire?... any suggestions?
[12:52:47] <willbeeler> i think you need a different version of jquery dont you?
[12:52:48] <willbeeler> mobile
[12:52:55] <willbeeler> i thiink the event is .touch or something
[12:53:02] <riseman> grafi: but still clueless on how to actually advance any further
[12:53:52] <grafi> ok, we can fix that ^^
[12:54:32] <willbeeler> can you set "this" inside of a function? example..
[12:55:33] <willbeeler> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QCTBY/
[12:56:04] <willbeeler> @Criten: those answers were to you btw
[12:56:13] <willbeeler> let me check to see if im right
[12:56:51] <willbeeler> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4934214/onclick-listener-for-touch-screens-and-tablets
[12:57:00] <willbeeler> @Criten: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4934214/onclick-listener-for-touch-screens-and-tablets
[12:57:04] <grafi> riseman so my idea is that when you check the checkbox, the isChecked property gets set to the artist
[12:57:19] <riseman> grafi: ok
[12:57:25] <grafi> riseman should be working in my fiddle, check a box, press output
[12:57:33] <riseman> let me see
[12:57:37] <willbeeler> anyone have any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/QCTBY/
[12:57:42] <willbeeler> is that possible?
[12:57:59] <grafi> setting this is possible yes willbeeler
[12:58:11] <willbeeler> would it be like that example?
[12:58:11] <riseman> grafi: yeah, i can see the output ;)
[12:58:19] <grafi> cool
[12:58:27] <willbeeler> ill try it anyways 1 sec
[12:58:36] <riseman> and has the isChecked as true
[12:58:45] <grafi> so lets say you check of a few artists and then get your "new" json
[12:59:15] <grafi> you would save that in the artists.js I guess, and next time you reload the page the script checks for any "isChecked"
[12:59:29] <grafi> and if it finds one, the checkbox is generated as checked
[12:59:41] <grafi> that way you keep your progress
[12:59:54] <grafi> you could also probably let php write the json to file
[13:00:04] <grafi> that would eliminate the manual copying
[13:00:35] <grafi> so like an ajax request to a little php script that just replaces the .js file with the new content
[13:00:36] <riseman> aaaah i see
[13:00:54] <grafi> not really sure how well it'll work for 1,9mb :P
[13:01:41] <riseman> haha yeah, its a huge file
[13:01:43] <grafi> maybe you should convert the json to a nicer format first, where the mbid's of the artists are the keys for the artist, that would searching the right artist to set "isChecked" on easier
[13:02:00] <riseman> nicer format could be xml?
[13:02:04] <willbeeler> @grafi: this is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/BkGvP/
[13:02:26] <grafi> riseman na, for js json is the best
[13:02:34] <riseman> oh ok
[13:02:34] <willbeeler> oh wait.. is it $(this)  ?
[13:02:38] <grafi> but now you have an array of artists, without name
[13:02:43] <grafi> just indexes
[13:02:58] <grafi> in my fiddle you can see the function walking through basically the whole array
[13:03:03] <grafi> until it finds the right mbid
[13:03:29] <riseman> exactly
[13:03:33] <riseman> that's kinda slow right?
[13:03:44] <grafi> when you convert that into an object with key = mbid you could just do artists[mbid].isChecked = true, or something
[13:03:54] <grafi> so you dont have to do the whole forloop stuff
[13:04:18] <grafi> but lets first try to get it working with the content we have
[13:04:19] <grafi> :)
[13:04:50] <grafi> i would suggest saving the 1,9mb file somewhere and using the 5 entries we use in the fiddle
[13:04:55] <grafi> just to test if its working
[13:05:03] <grafi> speed and such :P
[13:05:50] <riseman> yeah, that's true, ill do ir tight away
[13:07:41] <grafi> willbeeler why would you try to show something that you already clicked on oô
[13:08:02] <willbeeler> @grafi:  that was just a quick example of how i wanted to use it
[13:08:26] <willbeeler> @grafi:  it starting to work, i figured something out
[13:08:31] <willbeeler> give me a few
[13:08:37] <grafi> ok
[13:09:32] <riseman> grafi: ready, working on my site. Now im updating the new file manually
[13:09:41] <grafi> cool
[13:10:16] <riseman> grafi: it's missing the artists and artist bit
[13:10:25] <riseman> but i can fix that i think
[13:10:40] <grafi> hm yeah, thats true
[13:13:02] <riseman> grafi: updated the file, but the checked value won't appear checkd
[13:13:15] <grafi> bummer
[13:13:16] <grafi> :P
[13:13:48] <riseman> hehe
[13:14:21] <grafi> riseman try console.log ing the a.isChecked see whats up
[13:14:27] <grafi> in the forloop
[13:14:34] <grafi> or forEach
[13:14:35] <grafi> :p
[13:15:05] <pinholecamera> hey folks, i'm trying to create my own jquery form validation function after running into too many bugs with a lot of the plugins out there. when i submit the form and an input doesn't validate, once i try to resubmit the form it no longer lets me submit, and doesn't parse the .submit() handler at all
[13:15:13] <riseman> like this? console.log(a.isChecked)
[13:15:21] <willbeeler> @grafi: thanks for your help, no worries, i found a workaround
[13:15:25] <pinholecamera> any idea why it wouldn't refire the submit handler after running it the first time?
[13:15:36] <pinholecamera> i've got the function and example on pastebin: hey folks, i'm trying to create my own jquery form validation function after running intpo
[13:15:38] <grafi> willbeeler cool
[13:15:39] <pinholecamera> whoops
[13:15:41] <pinholecamera> that's not the url
[13:15:47] <pinholecamera> the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/rySH55m0
[13:15:47] <grafi> riseman yup
[13:16:01] <riseman> ReferenceError: a is not defined :S
[13:16:14] <pinholecamera> do i need to reinitialize the submit handler somehow every time i run it and it doesn't return true?
[13:17:02] <riseman> weird
[13:17:08] <riseman> I must be doing something wrong
[13:17:36] <grafi> artists.forEach(function(a) {
[13:17:39] <grafi> inside there?
[13:17:50] <grafi> maybe you fixed the json wrong?
[13:18:18] <riseman> bah
[13:18:24] <grafi> hm json looks good
[13:18:25] <riseman> i was trying in the console
[13:18:29] <grafi> oh
[13:18:30] <grafi> haha
[13:18:32] <grafi> yeah
[13:18:34] <grafi> that wont work
[13:19:37] <riseman> So i get 4 undefined and true
[13:20:22] <grafi> seems about right
[13:21:10] <grafi> now console.log(checked) below the var checked =
[13:21:13] <grafi> same place
[13:21:22] <grafi> there probably something wonky then
[13:21:28] <grafi> *there's
[13:22:20] <riseman> ok
[13:22:22] <riseman> done
[13:22:48] <grafi> hm
[13:22:50] <riseman> true (index):14 checked="checked"
[13:22:51] <grafi> looks ok to me
[13:22:54] <riseman> yup
[13:23:00] <riseman> no errors at least haha
[13:23:35] <grafi> hm
[13:23:45] <grafi> I fucked something up somehow oô
[13:24:32] <riseman> just the bit where it is supposed to get the input checked
[13:24:40] <riseman> but i don't know how to debug that
[13:24:47] <grafi> i just tried bypassing the check on my fiddle
[13:24:54] <grafi> now the boxes get checked

[13:25:44] <riseman> i see, you commented and just added true
[13:25:45] <grafi> not sure why its not working on your page then :x
[13:25:50] <riseman> seems like it's working fine
[13:26:31] <grafi> something with the checkbox creation
[13:29:36] <riseman> everything's on window.load
[13:30:08] <grafi> shouldnt be a problem i think
[13:30:32] <grafi> maybe replace the window load, with $(function() { /*code inside here*/ });
[13:30:39] <grafi> wont fix it probably though
[13:31:30] <riseman> grafi: maybe cause we're not printing checked=checked anywhere :D
[13:31:42] <grafi> you are not?
[13:31:46] <grafi> i am in my code :P
[13:31:48] <grafi> haha
[13:31:48] <grafi> :D
[13:32:03] <riseman> haha i've just realized my code is missing that same part
[13:32:19] <grafi> phew
[13:32:21] <riseman> lol, don't know how i did that
[13:32:24] <grafi> lucky me :D
[13:32:41] <grafi> cool
[13:32:46] <grafi> then it should be working
[13:33:11] <riseman> yup
[13:33:15] <riseman> working like a charm
[13:33:16] <grafi> for convenience i would implement the saving via php next ^^
[13:33:26] <grafi> spares you the copy and paste
[13:33:47] <riseman> yeah, that's definitely cooler than copy/paste
[13:34:01] <grafi> probably really easy too
[13:34:08] <grafi> i know the js side is
[13:34:13] <riseman> but right now i gotta go too. Chile vs Colombia (soccer) starts in a while. (im from chile)
[13:34:22] <riseman> Do you always hang around here?
[13:36:28] <grafi> yeah
[13:36:33] <grafi> at least my bouncer is :P
[13:36:42] <grafi> my soccer game just ended
[13:36:48] <grafi> germany vs. ireland :)
[13:36:53] <riseman> aah nice match
[13:36:55] <riseman> how did it go?
[13:37:03] <grafi> we (germany) won
[13:37:04] <grafi> 3:0
[13:37:18] <grafi> qualified!
[13:37:19] <grafi> :D
[13:37:25] <riseman> i hope colombia doesnt put the ball up our ass this time
[13:37:35] <riseman> we haven't qualified since a long time
[13:37:57] <grafi> good luck :)
[13:38:23] <riseman> thanks for the luck and the help :)
[14:00:34] <radicalbiscuit> Any jQuery Mobile pundits around?
[14:01:47] <radicalbiscuit> If so, I'm trying to make fixed-width columns in a table and I suspect interference on the part of jQM, but I'm not sure and wanted to bounce it off someone who knows more about it.
[14:04:20] <radicalbiscuit> I'm using the <col span="n" style="width: npx;"> method, and it's just not working. Does anyone know if jQM is interfering?
[14:05:46] <radicalbiscuit> Nevermind. I think it's actually working :/
[14:05:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[14:14:11] <diminoten> okay so I've got an API that's going to return a CSV file on a query, how do I create a query that'll cause the browser to download that file?
[14:14:37] <ph88> window.location = '/downloadToFile.txt';
[14:14:44] <diminoten> oh
[14:14:49] <Thoams_> wget
[14:14:50] <Thoams_> curl
[14:15:01] <Thoams_> be specific
[14:15:12] <diminoten> I'm in #jquery
[14:15:26] <Thoams_> $.ajax
[14:15:44] <diminoten> so if I $.ajax, it'll just attempt to download the result as a file?
[14:15:48] <diminoten> it's dynamically generated
[14:16:25] <diminoten> it's like /api/foo/bar
[14:16:43] <diminoten> I'll just try it and see what happens
[14:16:55] <Thoams_> WAIT
[14:17:04] <diminoten> oh noes!
[14:17:05] <Thoams_> oh, go on then.
[14:17:12] <diminoten> already done :)
[14:17:16] <diminoten> not to try it...
[14:17:18] <diminoten> now*
[14:19:33] <Acrack> hi how can i populate an object to have it like this please ? http://jsfiddle.net/mKVLW/1/
[14:20:47] <Acrack> an existing object*
[14:22:06] <Thoams_> http://jsfiddle.net/mKVLW/2/
[14:22:09] <Thoams_> not
[14:22:32] <s2013> how do i parse an ajax response as json?
[14:22:41] <Thoams_> quite sure why or how you'd get the arrays inside "users" to have specific names - preeeetty sure that it doesn't matter.
[14:22:52] <s2013> cause im submitting a form that returns a json and its working but i basically am getting the literal hash
[14:23:02] <Thoams_> stop
[14:23:08] <Thoams_> with the drugs
[14:23:12] <Thoams_> put the pipe down
[14:23:32] <Acrack> s2013: its an existing array, it is an event that populate the actual one
[14:23:37] <Acrack> object*
[14:24:06] <Thoams_> in which case your code paste helped neither you nor I
[14:24:27] <Acrack> s2013:         users{} = { user: user.id };   in js is it possible ?
[14:24:34] <Thoams_> no.
[14:24:36] <Acrack> :s
[14:24:38] <Thoams_> NEEEEXT.
[14:24:39] <snover> that doesn’t make any sense
[14:24:41] <Thoams_> :\
[14:24:45] <s2013> huh?
[14:24:45] <Thoams_> word.
[14:25:00] <Acrack> can you tell me what is the correct code ?
[14:25:07] <snover> no because i have no idea what you think you are doing
[14:25:27] <Thoams_> 0xBAADF00D
[14:25:32] * Thoams_ wins.
[14:25:54] <Acrack> :'(
[14:26:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> Acrack: what character you use to make crying face
[14:26:12] <Thoams_> one of the best learning exercises you'll ever come across
[14:26:19] <Thoams_> is learning to convey your problem to others
[14:26:20] <Acrack> oO
[14:26:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[14:26:30] <Thoams_> in a concise, answerable manner
[14:26:41] <Acrack> Thoams_: you are talking to me ?
[14:26:45] <Thoams_> yes
[14:26:48] <Acrack> ah ok
[14:26:51] <Thoams_> s2013 doesn't know what you mean
[14:26:57] <Thoams_> I don't know what you mean for trying
[14:27:18] <Acrack> im trying to add an object user in an object users that contain all users
[14:27:22] <Thoams_> but... it IS possible to fully and sufficiently describe these things to other people in such a way that they can help.
[14:27:29] <Thoams_> learning how to do that is crucial.
[14:27:31] <Acrack> im beginer in jquery js stuff
[14:27:34] <Thoams_> I'm off for a cigarette.
[14:28:54] <RadListControl1> is there some way of preventing a div object from changing color when hitting the arrow down key?
[14:29:23] <guide_X> it keeps toggleing between a white and gray state
[14:30:26] <WebDragon> would one normally put a $(window).resize( function ...) inside of jQuery(document).ready( function ($) {  ?
[14:33:28] <diminoten> okay so I did $.ajax, and I get my data back but how do I get it to download the data
[14:33:41] <diminoten> window.location = data; didn't work (go figure)
[14:35:02] <ph88> diminoten: why pull the data in your javascript ? have a server serve your files ...
[14:35:12] <diminoten> I do
[14:35:19] <diminoten> it's at /foo/bar/generate
[14:35:29] <diminoten> I pass in params to that path and it returns a generated csv
[14:35:44] <ph88> window.location = data;  <-- wrong     good --> window.location = '/foo/bar/generate';
[14:36:03] <diminoten> ph88 I need to pass json to /foo/bar/generate
[14:36:16] <diminoten> otherwise yeah I mean that'd probably work
[14:37:24] <pinholecamera> if you have submit() set to return false unless the user satisfies some criteria in the form, shouldn't it work once they've satisfied that criteria?
[14:38:00] <ph88> diminoten: first do /foo/bar/generate  then have another endpoint /foo/bar/download  to server up the file
[14:38:18] <pinholecamera> if i don't satisfy the criteria, it doesn't submit (which is good), but then when i enter what i'm supposed to, submit() no longer runs. doesn't seem right.
[14:38:23] <diminoten> I don't want to store this data to disk
[14:38:31] <diminoten> that's a massive waste of resourse
[14:38:33] <diminoten> resources
[14:38:35] <WebDragon> well that (TIAS) answers that question, easily enough
[14:38:49] <Velveeta> damnit guys, why didn't somebody tell me i wasn't connected all week?
[14:39:07] <ph88> diminoten: use a buffer on your server
[14:39:13] <diminoten> why
[14:39:14] <WebDragon> what's the best way to test for when a search form field loses focus ? (i.e. the user clicked somewhere else and abandoned the search)
[14:39:17] <diminoten> I mean, I shouldn't have to
[14:39:18] <pinholecamera> i've tried logging to console in the beginning of the submit() handler, and also have tried making a separate click handler... neither works once the submit() handler has returned "false" the first time
[14:39:24] <WebDragon> blur() ?
[14:39:32] <Velveeta> ^^^ what he said
[14:39:35] <diminoten> I have the data already in the success function
[14:39:37] <pinholecamera> i've noticed actually that the jquery validate plugin does this, it doesn't work right either
[14:40:51] <ph88> diminoten: try this http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html#idl-def-FileSaver
[14:41:35] <pinholecamera> the more i play with this the more it seems like it's actually some sort of serious jquery bug
[14:41:53] <Velveeta> pinholecamera: what's going on? i just got here
[14:42:46] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: i'm noticing that if i try to validate a form on .submit(), if it fails validation and i return false, then the submit() handler never responds to clicking on the submit button after that
[14:42:47] <diminoten> ph88 I don't want js to handle the writing to the fs
[14:42:50] <diminoten> I want the browser to do it
[14:43:07] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: it actually happens with the jquery form validation plugin as well, which is why i was trying to just write my own
[14:43:31] <Velveeta> pinholecamera: what if you change from returning false to doing an e.preventDefault() on the event object passed into the handler?
[14:44:01] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: that's actually what i was doing originally, i get the same result
[14:44:39] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: firefox 24 actually even passes an error when i do that
[14:44:44] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: err, a warning rather
[14:45:00] <Velveeta> weird… is there a jsfiddle or something where i could see this sort of behavior in action?
[14:45:07] <ph88> diminoten: if you don't want JS to write the data ... then why the **** are you getting the data in JS with an ajax request ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
[14:45:11] <pinholecamera> i can set one up no problem
[14:45:15] * ph88 facepalm
[14:45:44] <diminoten> ph88: because I have to pass data in the request
[14:45:50] <diminoten> how else can I do that except with javascript in the browser
[14:46:13] <ph88> there just two options here and you don't want neither of them
[14:46:21] <ph88> so maybe you can find option 3
[14:46:22] <ph88> good luck
[14:46:26] <Velveeta> pinholecamera: thanks, it'll help me try to figure out what's going on
[14:46:30] <diminoten> yeah, edit the api
[14:46:48] <diminoten> which is what I'm going to do, make it so I can just do "/foo/bar/baz?bing=123&bong=345
[14:46:55] <diminoten> " and make the links that instaed of javascript
[14:47:29] <ph88> yes good idea, then you don't need to pass json with a post
[14:47:33] <Velveeta> i've often wondered what comes after foo, bar, and baz… now i know, bing and bong :D
[14:48:11] <diminoten> bing bong, fing fong, zing, zap, flee, floo, fing, fong
[14:48:14] <diminoten> I've got tons
[14:49:05] <Thoams_> meep
[14:50:19] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: huh, i just noticed "disabled="disabled"" is popping up on submit... so this may actually be some phantom code somewhere doing this...
[14:50:34] <pinholecamera> Velveeta: took pasting my browser content into jsfiddle to notice that.
[14:51:14] <Velveeta> pinholecamera: if you're using chrome for debugging, you can try adding an observer to break on attribute changes
[14:51:27] <Velveeta> and that should trigger a breakpoint whenever something's setting that attribute on there
[14:51:33] <Velveeta> to help you trace it back to its origin
[14:52:33] <pinholecamera> wow, yeah, there's a third party plugin here that's just blanketing all my forms with a disabled attribute on submit, wow.
[14:52:52] <pinholecamera> that's a new one for me.
[14:53:47] <pinholecamera> i've been trying to figure this out all day, thought i was just crazy.
[14:54:04] <Velveeta> interesting, so if you were returning false, that should stop event propagation also, which means it's attaching its listeners before you are
[14:54:26] <pinholecamera> that makes sense
[14:55:18] <Velveeta> so if you're not sure where that plugin is coming from, one thing you can try is to open your console
[14:55:22] <pinholecamera> i can't imagine why they'd think it was a good idea to apply that to $("form")
[14:55:33] <mr3> is there any way to edit actual css properties in a stylesheet? like not just change css on an element directly.
[14:55:34] <Velveeta> and run $._data(yourElement, 'evt') i think
[14:55:41] <Velveeta> either that or 'event'
[14:55:43] <pinholecamera> ahh, okay, that's good to know
[14:55:47] <mr3> via javascript/jquery of course
[14:56:02] <Velveeta> and it'll pull the data from the internal jquery cache and show you that, which you can explore, and check the handlers that are bound for the submit event
[14:56:19] <Velveeta> and if you click on the handler link itself, that should take you to the file where that handler exists, which is probably the plugin in question
[14:56:28] <pinholecamera> perfect
[14:56:33] <pinholecamera> much appreciated!
[14:56:39] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[14:56:42] <Velveeta> good luck
[14:56:57] <pinholecamera> thanks!
[14:57:05] <Velveeta> mr3: this question has come up before, and yes, there are ways, but it's not advised, and it's not good practice
[14:57:23] <Velveeta> what you'd be better off doing would be to use more specific css rules to change the properties you're looking to change
[14:57:55] <Velveeta> example: if some condition causes you to want to change the properties of a class, instead, let that condition add an extra class to body, and target it with .extraClass .originalClass { property: value; }
[14:58:47] <mr3> Velveeta: is there a reason it's not advised? my case is pretty specific. i'm building a backend that manages "themes" that are customizable. persisting is fine and a separate issue, but live previewing is the issue. the reason being that specificity causes the most issues. i can't just add extra classes you know?
[14:59:05] <mr3> i understand it might be a little messy, and not generally the right solution
[15:00:07] <Velveeta> i don't advise it because your css should be static, as in, when the page loads, the css rules should be fixed, as opposed to having to figure out if certain css classes apply certain styles at one time and other styles at other times, completely independent of the css rules themselves, but modified by javascript and not being able to track that
[15:00:32] <Velveeta> as in, when you inspect that style, you should be able to see that it's stemming from stylesheet.css, line 326
[15:00:59] <Velveeta> not that it originally stemmed from there, but was modified by js, so that when you go to stylesheet.css:326 you see a completely different set of styles than what you're searching for
[15:01:14] <Velveeta> your html, js, and css should exist independently of each other
[15:01:31] <mr3> Velveeta: ok cool, yeah i don't think that applies here. when they save their preview, then then their settings are persisted on the server, and so when they normally view the site, none of this tom-foolery will occur
[15:01:34] <Velveeta> if you can programmatically alter your css, then you should be able to programmatically add a parent class that augments the child class properties in your css
[15:01:46] <mr3> right the issue is it's more dynamic than that
[15:01:54] <mr3> like color might be #000 or #001
[15:02:04] <mr3> can't have tons of classes to cover all possibilities
[15:02:22] <mr3> i think you're right though
[15:02:37] <Velveeta> in that case, i wouldn't apply programmatic changes to the css, i would programmatically *output* static css that was variable
[15:02:57] <Velveeta> so let's say they tell your app that they want class .myClass to be color: #001 like in your eample
[15:03:01] <Velveeta> example*
[15:03:46] <Velveeta> i'd persist that in the db somewhere, in some kind of css schema, and then when i embedded my stylesheet link for production, i'd say like <like rel="stylesheet" src="/path/to/my/stylesheet?id=123" />
[15:04:10] <Velveeta> and then server side, i'd pull that db record, load up a template for a css file, replace variable entries with their static db entries, and push that out as a static css file
[15:04:33] <Velveeta> your css file might look like: .myClass { color: $myColor; }
[15:04:37] <mr3> right, but for a live preview what would you do (what you're explaining so far is the main part of what i'm already doing, persisting and serving that way)
[15:04:46] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:05:07] <Velveeta> for a live preview, let me brainstorm for a minute :)
[15:06:11] <Velveeta> well crap
[15:07:09] <Velveeta> what i'm thinking isn't very scalable, and is a pretty ugly solution, but i would still probably not advocate hacking the css directly… i'm not *positive*, but i don't think it's a widely trustworthy method
[15:07:21] <sunbeam> i'd like to hide a certain box when i click outside some .class
[15:07:23] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[15:07:37] <Velveeta> i could be wrong in that, but i think locating the proper stylesheet, and the proper selector rule, and editing the properties of that, is very browser-specific and not entirely universally supported
[15:07:57] <mr3> yeah i think you're right
[15:08:06] <mr3> i think in my case, all i have to deal with is adding the rule
[15:08:13] <mr3> since i'm only trying to overcome specificity
[15:08:21] <mr3> i haven't tried it yet
[15:08:22] <Velveeta> sunbeam: you can attach a click handler to your body tag, and when it fires, check to see if ($(this).closest('.className').length === 0) { // hide your checkbox }
[15:08:26] <mr3> but i'm assuming it's like appending
[15:09:19] <Velveeta> mr3: the only thing i can think of for a preview would be to have one pending-changes kind of table to hold the current unsaved changes, and do the same kind of embedding of a link tag with an id, and do a page refresh for the live preview, so you offer the same functionality as production, without explicitly saving for previews
[15:09:27] <Velveeta> but like i said, that's an ugly thing off the top of my head
[15:09:48] <mr3> yeah, thanks for the ideas and explanations
[15:09:50] <mr3> it's helpful
[15:10:04] <Velveeta> you could probably do a live preview version without a refresh by dynamically appending a new link tag to the head, and deleting the current link tag that holds your existing stylesheet maybe?
[15:10:04] <mr3> i guess i'll just try a few things out and see what feels best
[15:10:21] <Velveeta> but it would still involve a round trip to the server to store those pending changes
[15:10:22] <mr3> luckily i only have to support ie9 and above, so if it get's a little out of hand, it still won't be too horrible
[15:10:32] <Velveeta> lucky you :D
[16:00:43] <SirPereira> Good night
[16:01:04] <SirPereira> Is there any reason why binding the scroll and calling the function would not work?
[16:08:46] <guide_X> I want to use masonry on an old site, but even including the js file breaks the entire layout of the site
[16:27:47] <SirPereira> anw out there?
[17:40:35] <mdev> so is fancybox basically useless on mobile?
[17:40:44] <mdev> because it looks terrible on my nexus 4
[17:59:37] <guide_X> mdev: i've targeted mobile with fancybox
[17:59:47] <guide_X> it takes some tweeking and debugging to get it right
[18:16:53] <otiuk> when i do a custom build of jquery mobile.. to just include the form stuff.. it just doesn't seem to initialize at all.. do i have to manually do that or?
[18:17:40] <otiuk> if i include just the normal build of jquery mobile.. it auto-initializes everything and styles everything.. but when i use the custom build.. it does basically nothing that i can tell
[18:22:44] <otiuk> the difference:  http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r (using full jquery mobile) .. then http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/1/ (using custom build)
[18:27:11] <oste> anyone ever used Bower to install ckeditor?
[18:28:21] <otiuk> oste, i just manually installed ckeditor just fine
[18:28:41] <oste> well ya, i can download it and put it where i want
[18:29:00] <oste> using Bower is a different story
[18:32:20] <Velveeta> otiuk: i've been digging through the source, it looks like your custom build is missing whatever module includes the $.mobile.initializePage() function
[18:34:16] <Velveeta> otiuk: are you including the 'init' module?
[18:34:20] <otiuk> velveeta, ya i excluded the "init" part of the build.. now that i included that it's working
[18:34:33] <Velveeta> gotcha
[18:35:04] <Velveeta> oste: what's happening when you try to bower install it?
[18:35:23] <oste> just getting a readme
[18:35:37] <otiuk> so.. http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/5/ it works now.. but the thing is i'm trying to accomplish something else.. which is to make the form in the div have the form styling and the one text field outside of it not get styled by jqm
[18:36:02] <otiuk> without having to designate it with data-role=none
[18:36:44] <oste> Velveeta do you use bower?
[18:36:47] <otiuk> Velveeta: see:  https://forum.jquery.com/topic/initialize-for-only-form-elements-within-a-specific-containing-element
[18:36:52] <Velveeta> oste: i've used it, but not extensively
[18:37:23] <oste> ah ok, ya I have tried a bunch of variations - it seems to download sometimes but still end up with just a readme
[18:37:42] <Velveeta> hmmm, no clue on that one then
[18:38:46] <otiuk> Velveeta: referring to me?
[18:39:56] <Velveeta> otiuk: no, that "no clue" was for oste :)
[18:40:00] <Velveeta> i'm still looking into your problem
[18:41:01] <otiuk> you know what i'm trying to do though.. basically make jqm only style the form elements in a specified div or only style specified form elements by class or something like that
[18:41:32] <thom__> okay i used to be much better at this... i have written 3d animation with javascript raw. i have written my own jquery plugins... but im soo rusty
[18:41:41] <thom__> heres the task at hand
[18:41:46] <thom__> followed by a jsfiddle
[18:42:09] <thom__> a simple img fade in on load
[18:42:13] <otiuk> i know it's weird, but i don't have control over what's before or after that div.. and i don't want jqm to take over the whole page.. just the portion within that div.. or only elements set by class
[18:42:23] <otiuk> Velveeta: ^
[18:43:47] <thom__> nm maybe its my img thats too big because this is working just fine
[18:45:19] <thom__> it works in jsfiddle but not in my machine
[18:48:44] <Velveeta> otiuk: is it just text inputs you're looking to convert?
[18:49:10] <otiuk> no all form elements.. text, textarea, select, range, checkbox, radio, etc etc
[18:49:20] <Velveeta> ok, let me keep digging then
[18:50:57] <otiuk> if you help me figure this out i will be indebted to you lol.. i've been troubleshooting all sorts of crap all day since around noon and it's almost 9p (with an hr to walk the pups)
[18:51:58] <Velveeta> well, so, jquery mobile creates widgets for all of those elements, so, technically, you could instantiate them all separately
[18:52:44] <Velveeta> e.g. $(yourContainer).find(':checkbox, :radio').checkboxradio(); $(yourContainer).find('input[type="text"]').textinput(); etc
[18:53:33] <Velveeta> i'm trying to find some central function that loops through each input type and instantiates it appropriately, but i don't see one… it looks like as each is defined, it just sets up a pagecreate listener that instantlates each of those widget types on the page
[18:54:07] <otiuk> onload?
[18:54:18] <Velveeta> "pagecreate create"
[18:54:30] <Velveeta> those are the actual events they're binding to internally
[18:55:06] <otiuk> i think there is a beforepagecreate you can bind to if need be
[18:55:15] <Velveeta> yeah i think that's right also
[18:56:17] <otiuk> if there was a way to take the first one example:  http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r .. and then just manually initiate them -- that might be good ya?
[18:56:42] <otiuk> but that doesn't have that global init so i don't know if that's even feasible
[18:57:01] <Ricaz> If I do $(document).on('click', 'tbody tr', function(e) { ... }); - how do I get the <tr> that was clicked?
[18:57:24] <Velveeta> ricaz: this
[18:58:16] <otiuk> Velveeta: my first thought was to assign all form elements on the page with data-role="none" except the items in the div or that carry a certain class.. but i couldn't get that to work :/
[18:58:17] <Ricaz> Oh.
[18:58:21] <Ricaz> Thanks
[18:59:00] <Velveeta> otiuk: http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/6/
[18:59:04] <otiuk> but jqm still takes over more than the form.. but i really just want to use the form stuff in this instance
[19:00:14] <otiuk> updated.. http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/7/
[19:00:36] <Velveeta> so yeah, you see how you can selective target those elements
[19:01:03] <Velveeta> you just have to write your own function to selectively target *all different types* of those elements, and executing the proper widget function on each of them
[19:01:16] <Velveeta> so, for selects, checkboxes, radios, texts, textareas, etc
[19:01:31] <otiuk> and controlgroups i suppose
[19:01:48] <otiuk> do you know where i can get what those functions are?
[19:01:52] <Velveeta> whatever requires a different visual appearance
[19:02:14] <otiuk> also is that calling the first custom build that doesn't globally initialize?
[19:02:22] <Velveeta> yepyep
[19:02:36] <Velveeta> the autoinitialize will automatically transform all elements
[19:02:46] <otiuk> ya f that
[19:02:48] <Velveeta> if you just want selective transformations, you're gonna have to leave out the autoinit
[19:03:15] <Velveeta> now, there is an option you can set, $.mobile.autoinitialize = false; to be able to include that init module but not have it auto-init on everything
[19:03:33] <Velveeta> i don't know that there's much of a point of including it though, if you want to selectively init those items
[19:04:10] <otiuk> ya this will work perfect once i figure out what each function is called
[19:04:40] <otiuk> and then what radio buttons and what not's equivalent to :text is, etc
[19:05:37] <Velveeta> if you open up the source code of jquery mobile and do a search for: "mobile.
[19:05:48] <Velveeta> (including the quotation marks)
[19:05:55] <Velveeta> you should find each individual widget definition
[19:06:04] <Velveeta> at that point, it's just making a list of them to be instantiated
[19:06:10] <otiuk> ok cool
[19:08:59] <otiuk> Velveeta: so.. $.widget( "mobile.checkboxradio", $.mobile.widget, $.extend( { -- the function would be checkboxradio() ?
[19:09:09] <Velveeta> yepyep
[19:12:34] <otiuk> Velveeta: do you know where i could find a list of the :<type> list i can't figure out what range elements would be
[19:13:03] <Velveeta> define range elements, because that's not an actual kind of element
[19:20:18] <otiuk> Velveeta: <input type="range">
[19:20:56] <Velveeta> ahhhhh gotcha, i don't think there's an actual jquery colon-selector for that, you'd have to use .find('input[type="range"]')
[19:22:12] <jphase> mmmmm.... colon
[19:22:16] <jphase> oh sorry, wrong chan
[19:22:19] <jphase> ;)
[19:22:22] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:22:29] * jphase rubs up against Velveeta
[19:36:01] <otiuk> Velveeta: .. i can't seem to get the range slider to render correctly... http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/11/  --- any ideas?
[19:40:06] <otiuk> i think the css does not remove the old range field
[19:40:34] <otiuk> see.. http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/12/ .. i added some css and all is well
[19:43:02] <Velveeta> otiuk: you can hide the original element before rendering as a slider: http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/13/
[19:43:46] <otiuk> haha nice
[19:43:53] <otiuk> i like that better
[19:43:58] <Velveeta> :)
[19:44:26] <otiuk> the css worked fine too now to hack the slider to make it 100% instead of what it comes up as
[19:45:49] <otiuk> http://jsfiddle.net/K9H6r/14/
[19:45:50] <otiuk> bam
[19:46:04] <otiuk> and today feels successful haha Velveeta
[19:46:09] <otiuk> i owe you big time
[19:46:16] <otiuk> you wouldn't happen to be located in chicago?
[19:52:13] <otiuk> if you were i'd offer to take you out for a few drinks right now
[19:52:14] <otiuk> hah
[19:53:06] <Velveeta> nopers, austin :)
[19:54:11] <otiuk> i'm implementing this solution into my main app.. standby lol
[19:54:16] <otiuk> ooo i like austin
[19:56:11] <otiuk> i went to a conference seminar deal down in buddha
[19:56:20] <otiuk> or i think it was called buddha or something like that
[20:01:56] <Velveeta> yeah, buda, just south of austin
[20:02:31] <otiuk> ya .. it was pretty awesome there..
[20:02:38] <otiuk> but i like austin in general
[20:04:53] <otiuk> Velveeta: i just followed ya on twitter.. if you are ever in chicago let me know.. !
[20:06:31] <quang> hi
[20:06:37] <quang> is it possible to call jquery from knockout?
[20:08:27] <Velveeta> i don't see why not
[20:09:10] <quang> how do i do it?
[20:09:13] <quang> i have an if
[20:09:15] <quang> binding
[20:09:27] <quang> <!-- ko if: Comix() != null -->
[20:09:33] <quang> then in it i put <script>
[20:09:36] <quang> and some jquery
[20:09:39] <quang> but it doesnt work?
[20:10:56] <Velveeta> i have no clue about knockout syntax, but if you include jquery, it should exist in the global namespace and be just fine to call from anywhere
[20:11:57] <quang> ok
[21:20:45] <voidhouse> Hello, Does the jQuery ajax handler when using 'json' as dataType will inspect the data for any specific parameter to indicate failer? How can I trigger an 'error' from the server over HTTP 200?
[21:43:54] <shoky> voidhouse: it'll trigger an error if you use dataType: 'json' and parsing the response as json fails
[21:44:05] <shoky> i.e. the response is invalid json
[21:44:44] <voidhouse> But I can't send something liek '{ "error": -1, "message": "Something went wrong }' ?
[21:45:02] <voidhouse> without having to handle that in the 'success' callback?
[21:45:31] <shoky> you can, but it won't trigger an ajax error. you can do your own error handling, if you want you can wrap that in your own deferred/promise (which is what $.ajax does too)
[21:45:59] <shoky> you'll have to handle the ajax response in a success callback at first

[23:06:00] <grim> I'm trying to make an image in an accordion title clickable but can't seem to figure out where to start.  i want to make the green check mark clickable on http://www.guifications.org/ but let the rest of the title work as normal
[23:15:09] <jphase> grim: you may want to write your own accordion code then
[23:16:34] <grim> jphase: I don't follow on how/why that would be necessary.  I have a span with an anchor in it, that should be higher in the z-order, i just need to get the accordion to not handle it for the element
[23:17:58] <jphase> grim: well perhaps try binding to a different element. Accordions are like 10 lines of code and writing your own allows you to do exactly what you need. That's why I suggested it
[23:18:51] <grim> jphase: ok, i'm just very noobish when it comes to js/jquery/jquery-ui is all :-/
[23:19:01] <jphase> grim: $('#accordion').accordion(); tells me that whatever the accordion method is doing is what you get. Since your check is *inside* your <h1>, hopefully whatever plugin you're using allows you to do what you need
[23:19:27] <jphase> grim: well you came to the right place ;)
[23:19:50] <jphase> grim: can I write up a quick example for you that might help?
[23:20:00] <grim> jphase: i just ran through a plugin tutorial to make the status icon... i don't really know what i'm doing ;)
[23:20:06] <grim> jphase: sure
[23:21:12] <jphase> grim: you're doing just fine, and this might work just fine for you. Start by trying to change $('#accordion').accordion() to something like $('.jenkins-success').accordion()    (which I doubt will work). If that doesn't work, I'll write something up for you real quick
[23:22:09] <grim> jphase: .jenkins-success only sets the background-image on the span in the title, it's tiny in comparison to everything else
[23:22:24] <jphase> k
[23:22:51] <jphase> it's just that these "just add water" accordions don't always allow you to do what you need, let me give you a very rudimentary example
[23:23:02] <jphase> with comments! :D
[23:23:07] <grim> awesome! :)
[23:33:03] <jphase> grim: this is kinda ghetto, but you'll get the idea http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/2sZPL/
[23:33:27] <jphase> I suppose it'd be only 8 lines of code instead of 10 if I didn't have the comments :\
[23:34:42] <grim> jphase: ok that works for the icon, but i'm trying to leave the basic accordion functionality working, but adding the icon which will open a link to a new page
[23:34:55] <jphase> oh
[23:35:13] <jphase> I misunderstood, so you want the accordion on the h1, but the on the click of the icon you want it to open a link?
[23:35:19] <grim> yes
[23:35:27] <jphase> oh then you can keep your current code I bet
[23:35:28] <jphase> sec
[23:36:39] <jphase> grim: and you don't want it to open that accordion as well? only go to a link?
[23:37:07] <grim> jphase: ideally, but it doesn't really matter since the page should open in the current tab
[23:38:30] <jphase> grim: $('.jenkins-success').click(function(){ window.location.href = 'http://google.com'; return false; });
[23:38:34] <jphase> that *should* work
[23:39:22] <jphase> grim: now if your success icons are created dynamically, that may need to be finagled with some sort of "after" type of event in whatever accordion you're using
[23:39:38] <jphase> looks like jQuery UI so at least you have that going for ya ;)
[23:40:41] <grim> yeah, they're dynamicaly added when parsing a $.ajax response
[23:41:31] <jphase> grim: k, then just attach that click event to them as they're created (before you append or what-not) and that should be fine
[23:42:23] <grim> jphase: awesome! thanks for the help!
[23:42:27] <jphase> np
[23:43:46] <grim> jphase: awesome, works great! thank you very much (feel free to try it too ;))
[23:44:01] <jphase> nice :D
[23:46:30] <jphase> has anyone ever seen a webpage with a page rank of 10 btw?
