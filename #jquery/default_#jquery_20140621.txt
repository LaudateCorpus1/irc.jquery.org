[00:05:50] <daslicht> do you know any way to display such a massive list in a more appealing way ? :
[00:05:51] <daslicht> http://www.schiffmini.de/listen/index00.htm
[00:06:04] <daslicht> for a dropdown its to much :/
[00:08:55] <Axman6> I'd split it up into sections by first letter
[00:09:58] <Axman6> any ops around? urmal needs kickbanning (sending my porn spam via PM)
[00:10:05] <Axman6> me*
[00:12:09] <_Ed> daslicht: I’d play with a few things….
[00:12:34] <_Ed> better font, smaller font, and add a 4th column
[00:12:36] <daslicht> _ed : just looking for inspiration
[00:13:04] <daslicht> I am more asking if therer is a pluging which lets me smart display thing and not how to better format this list :D
[00:13:16] <_Ed> you have width requirements?
[00:13:29] <daslicht> i have no reqirements yet , its not my page
[00:13:38] <daslicht> but i have to create something similar
[00:13:43] <daslicht> just doing research atm
[00:14:12] <_Ed> the css could use some help, you could probably fit 6 rows in there and not change the font at all with some better styles
[00:14:56] <daslicht> any other idea how to display such kind of data with a jquery plugin instead of a boring table?
[00:16:15] <_Ed> hmm
[00:18:19] <_Ed> nothign comes to mind that is as useful as what you got
[00:18:29] <_Ed> want a drop down?
[00:19:00] <_Ed> I can’t think of a need to use any sort of fancy jQuery for that, but that’s just my 2 cents
[00:19:54] <_Ed> sry i’m uninspired :(
[00:22:17] <daslicht> sam here :D
[00:22:27] <daslicht> same
[00:22:28] <daslicht> heh
[00:22:46] <daslicht> looks like to create a table either lol
[00:22:55] <_Ed> any reason the site’s not being built on a CMS?
[00:23:23] <_Ed> proably could find some fancy cms plug-ins for displaying linked lists
[00:26:05] <daslicht> it will be built on a cms
[00:26:14] <daslicht> iam going to use silverstripe
[00:29:44] <_Ed> I’ve read just a little about Silverstripe, not sure what’s available, or what they even call their, add-ons
[00:33:06] <_Ed> it’s late, check back here tomorrow when more gurus are around, best of luck! :D
[00:40:44] <aro_> when using sortable, how do i get a jquery object that references the target/source lists?
[01:52:10] <PrasanthG> any vertical image scroller with lightbox zoom effect ?

[05:03:28] <DelphiWorld> hi jQueryers
[05:03:41] <DelphiWorld> question, but expect it from a blind person;)
[05:03:48] <DelphiWorld> what's a inline image and a header image?
[05:04:18] <Manaus> I suppose an inline image is a image within the text flow
[05:04:28] <Manaus> like in a paragraph
[05:04:40] <DelphiWorld> ah, thank Manaus
[05:04:46] <DelphiWorld> Manaus: and header image?
[05:05:01] <Manaus> could be an image place in the header part of a page
[05:05:13] * DelphiWorld thank Manaus a lot
[05:05:47] <DelphiWorld> Manaus, would you mind giving me some design help? i am blind and can't be sure how is my design
[05:06:28] <Manaus> sorry can't follow at the moment
[05:08:45] <DelphiWorld> np Manaus
[05:09:00] <DelphiWorld> guys if someone wanna help with design & cleanup let me know

[06:15:44] <fullhdpixel> I have a problem with inserting text in the placeholder of an element: http://pastebin.com/p6Cq2Uv4
[06:35:02] <decx> buttons cant have a placeholder fullhdpixel
[06:35:16] <fullhdpixel> whoops
[06:35:28] <fullhdpixel> I just used document.getElementById("outputcloak").innerHTML
[06:35:33] <fullhdpixel> this works
[06:37:16] <systemfault> A placeholder on a button... wtf.
[06:38:02] <systemfault> fullhdpixel: Yeah... if you want to use the jQuery way.... $(selector).text(theText); or $(selector).html(theHtml)

[06:57:36] <Mounir_> hi guys
[06:57:44] <systemfault> sup
[06:58:15] <Mounir_> can someone help plz with an issue ? i have to build a table with alot of columns, so i've found jquery datatables.js
[06:58:36] <Mounir_> it render my data just fine, i provide a json and inject it to the table, everything is fine,
[06:58:49] <Mounir_> now, at works they asked me to put some custom sorting
[06:58:56] <Mounir_> like from date to date
[06:59:05] <Mounir_> getting the count of result from date to date
[06:59:07] <Mounir_> so again
[06:59:27] <Mounir_> i've found yadcf that "seem" to work well with jquery datatables.js
[06:59:41] <Mounir_> but the issue is, it's not working here , here is a test case http://codepen.io/anon/pen/alifh
[07:00:17] <Mounir_> i've followed the documentation, did what he mention, but it's not working for me
[07:00:31] <Mounir_> oh, here is the plugin http://yadcf-showcase.appspot.com/DOM_source.html
[07:01:11] <Mounir_> it is supposed to put some input in top of the table for custom filtering
[07:01:28] <Mounir_> it's exactly what i need but unfortunatly... not working for me
[07:01:31] <Mounir_> any guess ?
[07:02:34] <decx> datatables has its own sorting?
[07:04:36] <Axman6> that's kind of the point isn't it?
[07:05:18] <Mounir_> in fact there isent custom filtering like from date to date
[07:05:27] <Mounir_> it's not sorting, it's filtering
[07:14:19] <Mounir_> anyone ?
[07:29:44] <Fraz> hi

[10:02:28] <_Phaoris> the problem is datatable complain about using an unique id on the table

[10:02:53] <_Phaoris> do i have to create 5 hidden tables with unique id and call theme ?

[11:06:33] <DelphiWorld> it's pocible to add a icon per tab widget?
[11:52:32] <waaaaf> Hi everyone. Shouldnt I be able to animate both text and fontawesome icon in this line? <div id="top_hop"><a href="#home">Back to top <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-up"></i></a></div>
[11:52:45] <waaaaf> I can animate the color of the text just fine, but the icon just pops in and out.
[11:55:39] <waaaaf> Solved it. Just changed it from color to opacity animation. I guess fa doesnt react to the color attr.
[11:56:08] <rcw2> hey can someone explain how this page works? http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/ - i want to click on a menu item and have different content load.  how is this done?  i click 'contact' and it loads #contact but how do i get new content the page after that happens
[12:04:13] <t432> Anyone see any thing wrong with following ajax post call? It's not seem to be triggering the method body.  http://pastebin.com/2kMteW4X
[12:06:17] <systemfault> t432: Does the server actually expects JSON or just form data?
[12:06:36] <systemfault> Ah, real JSON
[12:06:51] <systemfault> Then try adding: processData: false to the ajax config object
[12:07:03] <systemfault> jQuery uses form data by default.
[12:07:16] <t432> ok...
[12:08:33] <t432> and how do I use json instead?
[12:08:53] <t432> if thats the problem.
[12:08:58] <systemfault> t432: Setting the contentType like you did and add processData: false
[12:09:05] <systemfault> Have you tried?
[12:09:10] <t432> nope
[12:09:17] <systemfault> I told you that 4 minutes ago :P
[12:16:37] <systemfault> t432: any luck?
[12:17:49] <t432> still loading. my ide is very slow,..
[12:18:27] <systemfault> Which one? (I use IntelliJ, fairly fast once started)
[12:28:04] <intellilogic> So I want to make an ebay bid sniper fast enough to outsnipe other snipers.  I'm considering just writing some jQuery to read timeLeft (JS var) on the ebay page.  Just run this from console within th eBay user session.  Does this seem like a reasonable solution or do you think the JS timer could be off?  Might it be faster to make a PHP sniper or something like that?  Some general input on the
[12:28:04] <intellilogic> concepts viability would be helpful.
[12:43:01] <jphase> intellilogic: I doubt ebay allows CORS requests from any origin
[12:43:24] <jphase> if my hunch is correct, it'd be pretty easy to do it in node.js though
[12:56:13] <sunbeam> putting all jquery code in one file (all plugins) is this recommended ?
[13:56:35] <t432> systemfault: No uck. Still getting a 400(bad request)
[13:58:03] <t432> Ah. His gone.
[14:00:54] <tw2113> sunbeam, if you're going for page load performance, yes
[14:02:08] <t432> Anyone see anything wrong with following ajax post call?  It's not seem to be triggering the method body (server method also pasted at bottom).  http://pastebin.com/uyp3MwCS
[14:30:20] <sunbeam> tw2113: ok, so putting all minified code in plugins.js is fine ?
[14:30:39] <tw2113> as long as none of the functionality breaks, yes
[14:30:46] <tw2113> that's called site optimization
[14:35:29] <sunbeam> ok

[14:52:45] <laravelnewbie> can someone point out where i'm wrong plz ?
[16:31:57] <fifosine> I'm following a react tutorial that includes this ajax call.  Could someone tell me what the ".bind(this)" call does?  And how is it possible?  It looks like it's a function call *on* a function block.  How is this valid?
[16:31:59] <fifosine> http://pastebin.com/HmjCyJym
[16:34:06] <shoky> fifosine: yes, functions in js are also objects, and they have a .bind method:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[16:40:26] <fifosine> shoky: So when I define the function, it becomes an object. Does it just float?  Where does it exist?  And since it's an object defined within a jquery call, does that give it the bind() method?
[16:43:00] <shoky> fifosine: bind() has nothing to do with jquery, it's javascript.  the function in your paste is an anonymous function, and it exists wherever $.ajax's internals puts it
[16:43:23] <shoky> fifosine: or well,  you're calling $.ajax passing to it an object
[16:43:37] <shoky> fifosine: so the function exists as a property of that object
[16:44:18] <shoky> and you can call .bind() on any function, anonymous or not, and it returns a new function
[16:44:59] <fifosine> shoky: Then when the function associated with the success key is called, am I calling the result of the bind function or that anonymous function?
[16:45:18] <shoky> fifosine: the result of the bind function
[16:46:27] <fifosine> shoky: It's kind of unfortunate that using bind() is necessary to keep access from global vars separate from an objects vars.
[16:47:01] <fifosine> shoky: You'd think that when referencing a function within an object, that function is obviously associated with the object.
[16:49:00] <shoky> fifosine: using bind() is only neccessary if you want to keep using "this" inside the callback to refer to whatever object it was referencing outside
[16:49:29] <shoky> you could do:  var obj = this;  $.ajax({... success: function(data) { obj.setState(...) } })
[16:50:17] <shoky> fifosine: and yes, "this" is tricky and not so intuitive in js
[16:54:02] <fifosine> shoky: Could you explain line 8 of the code snippet under "Partial Functions" at the link you provided?
[16:54:19] <fifosine> I don't get what's going on in that call
[16:57:57] <shoky> fifosine: list.bind(undefined, 37) means:  return the function list, but modified so that the first argument is pre-set to 37
[16:58:15] <fifosine> what about undefined?
[16:58:35] <fifosine> does that set "this" to undefined"
[16:58:36] <fifosine> ?
[16:58:38] <shoky> yeah
[16:58:50] <jcool_> how can we encapsulate each word in <span> tag in whole body of html.
[16:58:56] <shoky> list() doesn't use "this" so it doesn't matter
[16:59:30] <fifosine> shoky: right
[16:59:53] <jcool_> any tag in body that has html string should be broken into words and encapsulate with span.
[19:19:31] <grodt> how can I use a variable string as an instances name? if I have made song_1 as a sound instance, and I got a string track which equals "song_1" how can I use it? because I cant do track.play() it thinks its a string
[19:23:14] <Hyperking> i need help with a .load method using  the target argument
[19:23:17] <benlieb> is the FB.ui() call supposed to create an in-page dialog, or open a separate window?
[19:23:32] <Hyperking> here is a plunker http://plnkr.co/edit/Dbp6mKiQilCFV2mZwnWO?p=preview
[19:49:01] <Hyperking> i figured it out. I needed a space before the target element
[20:38:01] <Xliff> Anyone here who is supporting the api.jquery.com website?
[20:38:39] <Xliff> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getscript/ has an error in it that is preventing the example from working in the latest version of Chrome
[20:38:50] <Xliff> Line 22 reads:
[20:38:58] <Xliff> var url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jquery/jquery-color/master/jquery.color.js";
[20:39:08] <Xliff> Which comes out as text/plain
[20:39:12] <Xliff> It should read:
[20:39:25] <Xliff> var url = "https://rawgithub.com/jquery/jquery-color/master/jquery.color.js";
[20:39:47] <Xliff> Which properly sets the MIME type to "application/javascript"
[20:40:02] <Xliff> Just FYI
[20:40:43] <Xliff> See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17341122/link-and-execute-external-javascript-file-hosted-on-github for background
[20:45:56] <socialblogsite> how do you call when you make a script to work as a jquery plugin? (e.g. $(‘#somediv’).myScript( $some_options_array ); ) is that a classs? object? plugin?
[21:09:53] <doug65536v> hi
[21:20:36] <benlieb> socialblogsite: that would be a method on an object
[21:24:09] <Xliff> Anyone here who is supporting the api.jquery.com website?
[21:24:55] <danols> are there any deffered experts here? if so can you thorw some ideas at me why a resolved promise does not fire a done callback when called the second time?
[21:26:29] <danols> my approach is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14377038/how-do-i-use-jquery-promise-deffered-in-a-custom-function/24312270#24312270
[21:29:52] <danols> When I break when my cached promise is about to be returned and do $.when(self.oPromiseCache[JSON.stringify(oFilterObject)]).done(function(z) {console.debug(z)}) it works
[21:29:55] <danols> so wtf
[21:30:02] <danols> (been at this for 3 hours now)
[21:47:19] <shoky> danols: didn't understand the problem.. a jsfiddle showing it would be ideal
[22:03:23] <danols> shoky: very painfuly I figured it out
[22:04:19] <danols> I am trying to return my cached promised from $.when(...).done( <here> ) block which of course get's swallowed up and never makes it the the outer $.when(....).done(...) block
[22:05:10] <danols> shoky: is there any way that I can return to the outer $.when block?
[22:05:32] <danols> (the reason I am doing it inside another when block is that my 'key' for the cache depends on an async calle
[22:05:35] <shoky> danols: your code doesn't have any $.when , i don't know what you're talking about
[22:06:00] <danols> disregard my question, I figure it out - thank you for steping up thoguh :)
[22:09:26] <Xliff> danols: How did you solve it? I've been reading up on $.Deferred() because I've never used the interface until you mentioned it here (between bouts of distracting TF2 YouTube vids)
[22:10:10] <Xliff> Currently going through --  http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/
[22:15:06] <danols> Hi Xliff, I am trying to see if I can return the promise again in a second done, i.e. $.when(...).done( returns a cache if it exists).done ( catch it here and return it again?)
[22:16:00] <danols> Xliff: if that doesn't work I need to create a supported funciton as in the pattern here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14377038/how-do-i-use-jquery-promise-deffered-in-a-custom-function/24312270#24312270
[22:16:16] <Xliff> Right.
[22:16:34] <Xliff> The problem there is that if you are using a single Deferred object, the .done() will only get caught once.
[22:17:27] <Xliff> Sounds to me like you would need to create and return another $.Deferred object in your first done.
[22:17:45] <Xliff> That's IF I understand what you are trying to do, properly.
[22:17:47] <danols> I think so, it get's swallowed by the $.when block because my normal pattern is to reutnred cached object before we enter the $.when block
[22:17:58] <danols> I am doing that
[22:18:33] <danols> sorry no I am not, I am deffered.resolve(my return value)
[22:19:01] <Xliff> Yeah. For a cached value, you would need to create another $.Deferred() object and return that.
[22:19:12] <Xliff> Because once .done() it's done.
[22:19:18] <danols> I'm on a very slow connection here otherwise I'd do a join.me - am not explaining myself properly, if you see the link I posted I pretty much have the cache check INSIDE the $.when() block which fails
[22:19:19] <Xliff> (sorry....couldn't resist)
[22:19:31] <Xliff> Yeah.
[22:19:40] <Xliff> Gotta step away for a bit. Back later.
[22:19:48] <danols> ok good night
[22:20:11] <danols> I've figured out what's different now and can fix it
[22:25:04] <Xliff> danols: When you do, could you put up an explanation of what you did?
[22:25:08] <Xliff> I'd like to check it out, later.

[23:40:15] <Yahkob> inspect element to see what i mean
[23:41:46] <shoky> Yahkob: check the line where you append the span
[23:42:35] <Yahkob> I thought that would just wrap all the elements
[23:43:13] <Yahkob> what's really happening there?
[23:43:13] <shoky> inspect it closely, with your eye
[23:43:13] <shoky> or eyes.
[23:44:04] <Yahkob> hah k shoky
[23:44:05] <shoky> ;p
[23:44:35] <Yahkob> I have no idea!
[23:44:42] <Yahkob> Maybe I've been up to long i feel like an idiot
[23:45:09] <shoky> it's a small typo.
[23:45:12] <Yahkob> its like <span> element </span> <span></span>
[23:45:59] <shoky> ^^ that's what you should be appending yes, but that's not what you're appending in that line, if you look closely
[23:46:07] <Yahkob> hmmmm
[23:46:18] <shoky> er i meant, you should be appending <span>element</span>
[23:46:22] <Yahkob> AHA
[23:46:24] <Yahkob> hahahaha
[23:46:27] <Yahkob> omg
[23:46:27] <shoky> ;p
[23:46:33] <Yahkob> i saw that just as you said that
[23:46:34] <Yahkob> omg
[23:46:44] <Yahkob> clearly i have been up far too long
[23:47:02] <shoky> me too ;p
