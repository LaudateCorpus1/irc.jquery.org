[00:00:06] <sx2020> i think one of your main issues is conveying your issues
[00:00:12] <Webb34> ah
[00:00:14] <sx2020> be specific and clear
[00:00:19] <sx2020> what the problem is
[00:00:32] <sx2020> like "when you click on X, Y should happen  but it isn't"
[00:01:40] <Webb34> ok so i should have said "when you click show results, then the hospital name, when you switch tabs something should happen but isnt"?
[00:03:16] <sx2020> well just avoid vague words like "it" and "something should happen".  say: "if you click on the locations tab, console should display the tab name but it isn't"
[00:03:17] <ShawnRisk> if I am using his code: jQuery("body.i18n-fr input[id='edit-community--2']").val("Tapez votre communaut&eacute;..."); to try and translate text from english to french, how do I make this work if &eacute; comes out as &eacute; instead of Ã©?
[00:03:19] <sx2020> or somthing like that..
[00:03:30] <Webb34> alrighty
[00:03:34] <Webb34> thanks a lot
[00:03:43] <sx2020> good luck
[00:03:46] <Webb34> i should probably take a class on speaking
[00:04:17] <sx2020> not speaking so much as putting yourself  in your audiences shoes
[00:05:02] <sx2020> it will help when searching on google a lot, if you use very specific keywords and no fluff
[00:05:07] <sx2020> you'll get the hang of it
[00:06:16] <Law-VN> that's right
[00:07:22] <sx2020> Can anyone help me find the bug here that is causing the checkboxes to be unclickable? http://soundtap.com/edit_show/new
[00:07:33] <sx2020> Checkboxes cannot be clicked in chrome or ff
[00:07:35] <sx2020> at least
[00:07:48] <sx2020> driving me crazy
[00:09:30] <Law-VN> You gotta log in to do this
[00:10:16] <sx2020> oh snap 1 sec
[00:10:23] <Spokenbird> Was wondering if someone could help with a jQuery issue?
[00:11:04] <Spokenbird> I'm really new to jQuery, hardly know what I am doing x.x, I have this wordpress site I am working within, and I am trying to get the two images on this page
[00:11:05] <Spokenbird> http://www.earthamplified.com/listen
[00:11:18] <Spokenbird> to replace the html for the embeded video above
[00:11:19] <sx2020> Law-VN: should work now
[00:11:47] <Spokenbird> My code looks like this
[00:12:10] <Spokenbird> <script type="text/javascript"> $('#test').click( function(){     $('#divOfBigVideo').remove().append(<iframe id="video1" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/irpJc0f4dJk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>'); });  $('#test2').click( function(){     $('video1').remove().append(<iframe id="video2" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf6n6uIf-ow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></
[00:13:08] <sx2020> Spokenbird: I believe remove() will remove the element and will no longer be able to be appended to
[00:13:36] <sx2020> actually looks like a different issue
[00:14:53] <sx2020> @Spokenbird: you are calling jQuery in a script at the very top of your page... even before you load the jquery lib
[00:15:14] <sx2020> best way to debug javascript, is open up the console in Chrome browser
[00:15:21] <sx2020> you'll see the errors spit out there
[00:15:41] <Spokenbird> I was doing that with the firebug console but it wasnt showing any errors
[00:15:46] <Spokenbird> ill try again in Chrome
[00:15:50] <Spokenbird> I am really new to this
[00:16:08] <Spokenbird> I really only know HTML and CSS =\
[00:16:18] <sx2020> move that script at the top to after jquery is loaded
[00:16:55] <Spokenbird> Hmmm
[00:17:06] <Law-VN> sx2020 , try to remove <li>
[00:17:07] <Spokenbird> Trying to figure out how to do that within wordpress templates
[00:17:09] <Spokenbird> sec
[00:17:45] <sx2020> Law-VN: thanks trying now
[00:22:09] <Spokenbird> hmmm sx2020 im not sure where else to put it?
[00:22:12] <Spokenbird> Looking at the source
[00:22:27] <Spokenbird> it looks like there a lot of other wordpress javascripts that come before it no? =ox
[00:23:26] <sx2020> @Spokenbird: your script is even above your opening <html> tag
[00:23:32] <sx2020> you need to move it into the head or body
[00:23:40] <sx2020> you see that right?
[00:24:45] <beasty> mornings
[00:24:53] <beasty> got a question
[00:25:15] <beasty> let's say i have a string 'lalalalala la al al ala <a href=...></a>'
[00:25:30] <beasty> how do i remove the <a></a> from that string ?
[00:25:50] <Eviltwin> You can use the DOM in a document fragment
[00:26:04] <Eviltwin> It depends on how picky you are about the rest of the formatting
[00:26:18] <Law-VN> did you try to remove li tag, sx2020 ?
[00:26:42] <sx2020> @Law-VN: I manually removed some of them in the console, and no luck.
[00:27:04] <Spokenbird> Hmmmm o.O
[00:27:08] <sx2020> the <li>s are generated with a standard django form rendering class.. so i don't there is something inherently wrong with that.
[00:27:19] <beasty> Eviltwin: i tried doing it like this
[00:27:34] <beasty> $(msg).find('a.close').remove().end();
[00:27:44] <sx2020> @beasty: are you trying to remove the contents inside the <a> tag as well?
[00:28:10] <beasty> sx2020: yes
[00:28:18] <Spokenbird> wierd
[00:28:22] <Spokenbird> thats not my script @_@
[00:28:28] <Spokenbird> I dont even know where that came from o_o
[00:29:17] <sx2020> @beasty: is the string rendered to DOM already, or just a string?
[00:29:34] <sx2020> does the <a> element exist on the page as a link?
[00:29:52] <beasty> sx2020: no
[00:30:09] <beasty> i'll create a fiddle
[00:30:11] <beasty> hang on
[00:31:40] <sx2020> in javascript you can use string manipulation: newstring = string.split('<a')[0] + string.split('</a>')[1] ;
[00:32:40] <Eviltwin> Be very careful with that
[00:32:42] <beasty> sx2020: http://jsfiddle.net/pgQsW/
[00:32:44] <Eviltwin> That only works if you have one
[00:33:19] <Eviltwin> And is case- and whitespace-sensitive
[00:33:49] <alex____> hi guys, i'm using .submit(); to submit my form to another page (using post) but on my other page i can't get my var back with $_POST... am i doing something wrong?
[00:34:11] <Eviltwin> Depends on what you're doing
[00:34:15] <Eviltwin> But probably
[00:34:17] <Eviltwin> Since it's not working
[00:36:29] <alex____> Eviltwin: may i show you my code? to take a look?
[00:36:42] <sx2020> @beastly: checking it out now
[00:36:49] <sx2020> beasty* sorry :)
[00:39:41] <alex____> nvm I found my error
[00:39:47] <beasty> sx2020: found a solution
[00:40:10] <sx2020> cool
[00:40:20] <beasty> sx2020: http://jsfiddle.net/pgQsW/4/
[00:40:29] <Gaia> Anyone here in the php channel?
[00:40:38] <Gaia> if so, how can i get an invite?
[00:40:46] <Eviltwin> You want ##php
[00:40:52] <Eviltwin> Not #php
[00:41:02] <Gaia> o :O
[00:42:30] <beasty> that's a weird bug
[00:42:36] <beasty> or a 'way' of working
[00:42:51] <beasty> that it needs to be surounded with tags
[00:43:08] <sx2020> @beasty: It's because it is not a DOM element without tags.
[00:43:15] <beasty> ok
[00:43:19] <beasty> but it works now ):
[00:43:21] <sx2020> jquery needs elements, not strings
[00:43:21] <beasty> err :)
[00:43:22] <Eviltwin> beasty: Use .html() if you want to preserve other HTML
[00:43:34] <beasty> mm no
[00:43:38] <beasty> just plain text
[00:44:52] <LukeNukem> hello
[00:45:03] <LukeNukem> i have a variable whichs value is 1
[00:45:11] <LukeNukem> so newvar = -oldvar
[00:45:14] <LukeNukem> gives me -1 instead of 0
[00:45:15] <LukeNukem> why is this
[00:45:33] <Eviltwin> Uh...what?
[00:45:39] <sx2020> you caan't just add a dash to it
[00:45:40] <Eviltwin> You're asking why -(1) is -1 instead of 0?
[00:45:50] <Eviltwin> sx2020: Do you know JavaScript?
[00:45:50] <sx2020> oh
[00:46:13] <Eviltwin> Because, yeah, you can just add a dash to it to negate it
[00:46:14] <sx2020> lol
[00:47:19] <sx2020> yeah my bad
[00:47:39] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, how am i to substract it?
[00:47:51] <Eviltwin> ?
[00:47:53] <Eviltwin> What?
[00:48:14] <johnAnderson> hello, can I change cycle attribute at run time? I would that starting page is different on each page reload
[00:48:34] <LukeNukem> $("#meter_"+statusid).data("likes").val(newlikes);
[00:48:38] <LukeNukem> does that make sense?
[00:48:46] <Eviltwin> Not terribly, no
[00:48:50] <Eviltwin> There's no subtraction at all there
[00:50:39] <hurry> if i have <li id="1"><div id="2"></div> </li> how can i modify 1 of my li ?
[00:51:05] <Eviltwin> Do you mean change the ID?
[00:51:26] <sx2020> you mean modify the 'id' attribute?
[00:53:26] <hurry> is
[00:53:29] <hurry> yes
[00:53:38] <SoulRaven> anyone has experice with http://www.jeasyui.com ?
[00:53:46] <hurry> i'm try with $("#"+pagina).prev().attr("id", "newId");
[00:53:58] <SoulRaven> i have some problems with toolbars on this plugin
[00:55:42] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, i want to modify the data-likes attribute of element #meter_2
[00:55:52] <LukeNukem> will the code i posted above work?
[00:56:24] <Eviltwin> No
[00:56:37] <LukeNukem> Then do show me how
[01:01:35] <sx2020> Can anyone figure out why my checkboxes are unclickable? http://soundtap.com/edit_show/new
[01:02:00] <hurry> how can i acces to <li> if i have <li><div></div></li> ? with prev() ?
[01:02:56] <sx2020> hurry: select it by the ID if you know it.  $('li#1').attr('id','newId');
[01:03:14] <sx2020> why do you need to use prev()
[01:03:35] <LukeNukem> How can i change the value of a data attribute in an element
[01:04:17] <hurry> because i have many li and i must change one li after save div inside li
[01:04:54] <dixon_> Can I bind a change event, to a non-DOM object like a javascript object? I've tried something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QPejZ/ but it doesn't seem to work?
[01:05:06] <hurry> i have <li #foo_><div></div></li> after save i must have <li #foo_100><div></div></li>
[01:05:16] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, anyidea?
[01:06:00] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: var meter = $("#meter_"+statusid); meter.data("likes", meter.data("likes")+1);
[01:06:19] <cyberalien> hurry: try $('li > div').parent()
[01:07:46] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, i want to change it, not add it..i figured out how to add
[01:08:00] <hurry> cyberalien: $("li > div").parent().attr("id","newId");
[01:08:01] <hurry> ?
[01:08:09] <cyberalien> yep
[01:08:23] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: That's described on the API page for .data
[01:09:20] <hurry> cyberalien:  i try like this :  $("li" > "#"+pagina).parent().attr("id","newId");
[01:09:34] <hurry> but dosen't works, is it correct syntax?
[01:09:54] <cyberalien> i thought you had id for <li>, not for <div>?
[01:10:22] <cyberalien> and why did you move > out of string?
[01:10:32] <LukeNukem> i dont see it Eviltwin
[01:11:44] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[01:11:58] <hurry> my problem is this: i have <ul><li id="move_"><div></div></li></ul> i have many div and many li, when i save one div, ui must update the li inherit with id (sorry for my english)
[01:12:11] <beasty> w00t w00t
[01:12:20] <beasty> sorry wrong window
[01:12:59] <beasty> damn autofocus on mouse
[01:14:21] <zfmf> does someone know a plugin like this? http://m.friendfeed-media.com/55229534544c992a60c41e5a654911d2e441ef95
[01:14:29] <Eviltwin> Look at jsTree
[01:14:48] <mehrdad> anything wrong with this line?  $("textarea[name=map_coor]").val(geom.x);
[01:15:08] <mehrdad> i do a console log right after that and get the val, and it returns the val correctly
[01:15:18] <mehrdad> but in the html i can't see the value
[01:15:30] <Eviltwin> Uh...you know that HTML doesn't change once it loads, right?
[01:15:39] <Eviltwin> It's static
[01:15:55] <mehrdad> of course, but it is in the process of getting loaded
[01:16:06] <mehrdad> the code runs at that time
[01:16:12] <Eviltwin> ...
[01:16:14] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, i know the api page, i just dont see where it says how to change the value :(
[01:16:15] <Eviltwin> Even then
[01:16:33] <Eviltwin> The HTML doesn't change once it downloads...ever
[01:16:44] <Eviltwin> Even while it is in the process of downloading
[01:16:50] <SoulRaven> i have some problems with toolbars on this plugin
[01:16:56] <Eviltwin> The characters that have already been downloaded will not change
[01:16:58] <SoulRaven> anyone has experice with http://www.jeasyui.com ?
[01:17:23] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: "As of jQuery 1.4.3 HTML 5 data- attributes will be automatically pulled in to jQuery's data object. The treatment of attributes with embedded dashes was changed in jQuery 1.6 to conform to the W3C HTML5 specification."
[01:17:27] <LukeNukem> $("div").data("test", { first: 16, last: "pizza!" });
[01:17:30] <LukeNukem> is that it?
[01:17:38] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: .data( key, value ) Description: Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements.
[01:18:14] <mehrdad> but Eviltwin , tho i guess i know what u mean, i have seen the scripts that change the value of input fields
[01:18:29] <mehrdad> i mean this is basic js right
[01:18:52] <LukeNukem> $("#meter_"+statusid).data("likes", newlikes);
[01:18:54] <mehrdad> u click something and the value of an input field changes
[01:18:57] <LukeNukem> mehrdad, gtfo rofl xD :D
[01:19:14] <mehrdad> LukeNukem, whats up punk :D
[01:19:30] <LukeNukem> hold on mate, jq is fuckin me
[01:25:01] <hurry> cyberalien:  $("#"+pagina).parent().attr("id","recordsArray_"+data.id_menu); it's works thanks you so much
[01:25:46] <cyberalien> $('#' + pagina + ' > div')
[01:26:10] <hurry> what is > like parent() ?
[01:26:16] <cyberalien> ..which doesn't make sense ether. if you already have id, why would you need to change it?
[01:26:43] <hurry> data.id_menu retrive by Database after Save
[01:26:53] <hurry> and after i can do sortable
[01:27:24] <hurry> before save i have <li id="recordsArray_">
[01:28:23] <cyberalien> i don't understand your logic. what exactly do you need to find? at start you said you needed to find <li> that has <div> as direct child
[01:29:11] <hurry> yes i must change the id of <li> when i save the div
[01:29:22] <cyberalien> then just find item with that id and change id
[01:29:33] <cyberalien> $('#whatever').attr('id', 'newid')
[01:29:54] <hurry> after save i call this in success: $("#"+pagina).parent().attr("id","recordsArray_"+data.id_menu);  and i have <li id="recordsArray_100"><div>....</div></li>
[01:30:25] <hurry> i haven't data.id_menu, i retrive data.id_menu) by Json after Save
[01:31:33] <cyberalien> then why do you need parent()? $('#' + pagina) already finds your <li>, .parent() changes it to <ul>, so you are assigning id to <ul>
[01:31:53] <hurry> $('#' + pagina)  = div
[01:32:04] <cyberalien> no, its <li> from html code that you posted
[01:32:31] <hurry> So I badly explained
[01:32:53] <hurry> sorry, but your suggestion has been useful
[01:32:56] <cyberalien> ok, so id you are looking for is assigned to <div>, you need to find parent <li>, right?
[01:33:03] <hurry> right
[01:33:11] <cyberalien> $('#' + pagina).parent('li')
[01:33:48] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, is right, mehrdad html cant be changed
[01:33:54] <hurry> ok tanks  a leot sorry for my english
[01:33:59] <hurry> thanks a lot :)
[01:41:03] <ansh> i have created  a demo for selecting an area using mouse events everything is working fine in all browsers but in IE9 mouseup ,mousedown is not working fine ,can anyone suggest me wht is the problem here is the code please check it on IE here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/hwJxd/1/

[02:21:13] <beasty> anyknows a polling lib for jquery ?
[02:21:19] <Mick-UK> Any helpers guys with this autoscrollbar on the accordian, cant find any answers via the forum
[02:21:32] <ansh> mouseup event is not working sometimes on IE here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/hwJxd/1/
[02:21:32] <HardFu> http://www.unidrain.se/typo3conf/ext/hotspots/res/js/jquery.imagemap.js?1330343738
[02:21:40] <HardFu> this is the relevant part, line 7
[02:22:18] <fof> HardFu: did you look at my link?
[02:23:00] <HardFu> yes
[02:23:38] <HardFu> tried adding e.stopPropagation() on line 8
[02:23:58] <HardFu> or should I register clicks on the orange circles as well and handle them inside jQuery
[02:24:06] <HardFu> because they are just normal links
[02:24:28] <Webb34> the issue is the click occurs if anypart of that div is clicked
[02:25:01] <Webb34> if the svg takes up the whole page why not have the whole site be an svg?
[02:25:17] <HardFu> because it's a plugin, and not used everywhere
[02:25:21] <HardFu> the SVG part
[02:25:22] <Webb34> ah ok
[02:26:01] <Webb34> either way the click will fire because you are clicking within the div
[02:26:07] <SoulRaven> anyone has experice with http://www.jeasyui.com ?
[02:26:23] <Webb34> have you tried applying the click event to the img tag instead of the div?
[02:27:58] <HardFu> no, I'll try it
[02:28:08] <Webb34> also beasty you still there?
[02:29:03] <beasty> Webb34: yes
[02:29:23] <Webb34> i read the page you sent me
[02:29:39] <Webb34> and im wondering if i read it right(ive been awake for a few days straight)
[02:30:02] <Webb34> is it saying that the thing used the call the xmlhttprequest doesnt exist anymore and therefore i get an error?
[02:33:34] <beasty> Webb34: go to sleep first
[02:33:39] <beasty> and then read it again :)
[02:33:41] <Webb34> cant
[02:33:54] <Webb34> this is a hw assignment due tomorrow
[02:33:59] <Webb34> and this is the ast part
[02:34:01] <Webb34> last*
[02:34:10] <Webb34> so....close....
[02:35:44] <ansh> mouseup event is not working sometimes on IE here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/hwJxd/1/ .. please help me on this struggling for long time
[02:40:02] <HardFu> hmm if I do $('.hotspots').children('a').click... the click isn't even registered
[02:40:32] <fof> ansh: look at jslint
[02:42:23] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/hwJxd/22/
[02:42:37] <beasty> Webb34: take a 3hour nap
[02:42:40] <beasty> then continue
[02:42:50] <Webb34> alrighty beastly. it doesnt look like anything bad is happening
[02:43:00] <Webb34> i feel llike it might be doing a call somewhere it doesnt need to
[02:43:28] <Webb34> on another note is anyone good with google maps jquery plugin?
[02:48:25] <Xotix> hi, i have a div, if i hover over it, i want to change its backgroudn color with an animation. so the new color comes slowly. What am i doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/HrNrw2NB
[02:50:31] <markj> Xotix:  if you want to animate colour you need the color plugin
[02:51:28] <Xotix> markj, i got itâ¦ stupid mistake. But anyway, is it possible to make .hover() work like css:hover?
[02:51:53] <markj> work like it how?
[02:52:02] <fof> also have an extra comma in the anon function
[02:52:15] <fof> i mean in animate function
[02:52:35] <Xotix> undo the chagnes if i'm stop hovering over the element.
[02:53:10] <fof> you can apply its original style with the mouseleave part of hover?
[02:55:09] <Xotix> hmm, too much work for just that little effect. but thanks :)
[03:03:25] <ansh> fof: thnx for otimizing the code but my problem is still unresolved , in IE sometimes mouseup event is not fired and mousemove keeps firing
[03:04:02] <y3di> how can i get a string of a jquery object
[03:04:25] <ansh> fof: so even when i release the mouse  it draws the rectangle
[03:04:51] <y3di> var $info_content = $('<a />').attr("href", '#').text("Learn More"); -- how can i get this: <a href="#">Learn More</a>
[03:06:35] <Cork> y3di: exactly how you did it should work
[03:07:13] <y3di> Cork: well i tried .html() but that just returns "Learn More"
[03:07:43] <Cork> ya, cause .html is innerHTML
[03:07:52] <Cork> it returns whats inside the element
[03:07:54] <Cork> not the element
[03:08:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/YpwQz/
[03:09:48] <poppiez> is there any advantage to loading your JS asynchronously (like Google Analytics) on your site?
[03:10:16] <Cork> poppiez: it reduces the time it takes before the content shows
[03:10:31] <poppiez> Cork: but if the JS is at the bottom of the page, does it really matter?
[03:10:34] <Cork> all js in the header has to be parsed before the content is shown
[03:10:47] <y3di> Cork: im using the google maps api. and the infowindow attribute takes an html element/string. I tried to give it $info_content but it errored out with invalid type. but it works with a string. So what I need to do is get the string representation of $info_content
[03:10:48] <Cork> poppiez: when its at the bottom its run after the content is shown
[03:11:05] <poppiez> Cork: right ok, so you'd recommend doing it?
[03:11:17] <Cork> poppiez: depends, i don't use it my self
[03:11:26] <poppiez> Cork: what talks against it?
[03:11:33] <Cork> but if you have much js to load, and the page is meaning full before using them
[03:11:35] <Cork> then ya
[03:11:47] <beasty> morning Cork
[03:11:55] <ansh> fof : can u suggest me the solution ?
[03:12:04] <Cork> poppiez: most of the time i either don't use that much js, or too much js to do it that way
[03:12:09] <poppiez> Cork: good point. what about the ready function btw? when will that run?
[03:12:11] <fof> ansh: no idea
[03:12:27] <Cork> beasty: 'gday
[03:12:53] <Cork> y3di: why are you even going the way around a dom element if all you need is html?
[03:13:25] <Cork> y3di: if your constructing a complicated html structure its one thing
[03:13:47] <Cork> but for a single a tag with some text in, is just overdoing it
[03:13:58] <beasty> Cork: so hows life ?
[03:14:06] <Cork> beasty: busy
[03:15:43] <y3di> Cork: well the a element was just a proof of concept. The actual element will be more complicated
[03:15:59] <beasty> Cork: nice :) same here trying to figure out a way to do a push-pull between js & lighttpd with only 2mb of free space
[03:16:00] <Cork> y3di: then you need to generate an extra element
[03:16:08] <y3di> Cork: ok, that works then. Thanks
[03:16:24] <Cork> y3di: $('<div/>').append($('<a />').attr("href", '#').text("Learn More")).html()
[03:17:04] <Cork> beasty: simplest is prob through ajax longpull
[03:17:17] <Cork> though i don't think you will manage 2mb
[03:17:30] <beasty> Cork: indeed
[03:17:42] <beasty> but with the longpull ... the browser keeps 'loading' the page
[03:18:05] <Cork> beasty: only broken browser that shows ajax as page loading
[03:18:11] <Cork> (namly safari)
[03:19:47] <beasty> indeed
[03:19:54] <beasty> client works on safari
[03:20:18] <Cork> beasty: but there isn't really anyway around that
[03:21:05] <Cork> (unless you want to implement websocket)
[03:21:14] <y3di> is there a reason why you should do all your prototype changes/class manipulation inside an anonymous function?
[03:21:15] <beasty> i was look at that
[03:21:27] <beasty> but that seems to be in a early developments stage
[03:21:33] <beasty> for 'internet explorer' that is
[03:21:35] <Cork> not really
[03:21:43] <Cork> ie10 has support
[03:21:48] <elegos> hello! may I ask here about a plugin which doesn't accept new threads in their forums and have no contacts? I'm talking about jQueryTools, in particular about the tooltips...
[03:21:50] <Cork> ff and chrome has full support
[03:21:54] <Cork> opera has none
[03:22:12] <Cork> and safari has a REALLY old version
[03:22:25] <Cork> (one that was so bad opera and firefox disabled it)
[03:22:45] <Cork> hixi76
[03:22:57] <beasty> i bet netscape has better support
[03:22:57] <beasty> :p
[03:23:19] <Cork> i'm not even sure netscape has html5 >_>
[03:23:26] <nFFFF> y3di
[03:23:32] <nFFFF> is this what you want
[03:23:33] <nFFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/ssJrm/
[03:23:43] <elegos> http://uni.elegosproject.org/database/ the tooltip should appear on the thumbnail, not on the right... may you help me please? The jQuery calls are at the bottom of the body tag
[03:25:54] <nFFFF> y3di here is with your specific element http://jsfiddle.net/ssJrm/1/
[03:26:03] <nFFFF> Just use JS native outerHTML to get the html
[03:26:25] <y3di> oh thanks nFFFF, idk why i overlook native js functionality sometimes when using jquery
[03:26:35] <y3di> nFFFF: i didn't think itd would on a jquery object i guess
[03:26:47] <nFFFF> IT doesn't
[03:26:52] <nFFFF> So you use [0]
[03:27:02] <y3di> oh i see
[03:27:02] <nFFFF> To return DOM object
[03:27:08] <y3di> right
[03:28:55] <elegos> http://uni.elegosproject.org/database/ the tooltip should appear on the thumbnail, not on the right... may you help me please? The jQuery calls are at the bottom of the body tag
[03:29:53] <nFFFF> y3di, you can also use get method in jquery
[03:29:55] <nFFFF> ?get
[03:29:55] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[03:30:09] <nFFFF> same thing
[03:31:11] <Webb34> ok can anybody help me here?

[03:33:28] <tankblergh> hi! is there a way to make the .change() event to trigger from a textbox while it's still in focus?
[03:36:30] <peterschmidler> How can I find out the id of a div class "foo" which is made visible with .show() ?
[03:40:03] <Trudko> guys I have a link which I disable, but if I add listener using click, disabling does not work I need to use delegate, I dont uderstand why http://jsfiddle.net/bUKNU/4/
[03:40:41] <Trudko> btw I did not and I can't change code for disabling the code so that is not important.
[03:43:13] <jack123> hi to every1
[03:44:48] <jack123> i have a 1 clarification when ever click menu bar link that time to add more links in same menu bar its a possible r not in jquery
[03:45:13] <jpic> hi all, i'm trying to display a list of choices when the jquery-ui autocomplete gets focus. So i thought i would bind the focus to $('#theinput').autocomplete('search') but it's not doing anything
[03:45:17] <jpic> any idea please
[03:47:07] <jpic> i even tried $('input[name=legal_state]').autocomplete('search', 'f') but it doesn't do the trick ... althought if i type 'f' in the field it does show items
[03:47:44] <jpic> my bad, wrong field ^^
[04:06:29] <Webb34> hey can anybody look at my site and help me figure out why my map wont get destroyed? Im using google maps jquery plugin and the gmap('destroy') wont work. here is the site if you want to give it a shot http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[04:07:15] <Trudko> guys I have a link which I disable, but if I add listener using click, disabling does not work I need to use delegate, I dont uderstand why http://jsfiddle.net/bUKNU/4/
[04:07:17] <Trudko> btw I did not and I can't change code for disabling the code so that is not important.
[04:11:07] <jita> Any idea why jquery is not loaded in this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/hQJ32/2/
[04:13:54] <Trudko> jita: you did not pick jquery libr at the left panel
[04:14:58] <Xotix> the slie effect, from left to right, is it possible to have it from the right to the left?
[04:15:01] <SoulRaven> anyone has experice with http://www.jeasyui.com ?
[04:15:12] <jita> Trudko, this is what you mean ? <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[04:15:44] <Trudko> jita no at the left panel of page  you have dropdown under Choose Framework
[04:16:49] <Trudko> jita I am talking about jsfiddle page...
[04:16:51] <Trudko> ofc
[04:17:03] <jita> Trudko, it doesnt work even after choosing it :(
[04:17:11] <Trudko> post link
[04:18:17] <Trudko> ok nevermind I tried it and how do you know it does not load? it does.
[04:18:50] <Trudko> jita for example reset button dows work so Jquery does load
[04:19:01] <Webb34> hey can anybody look at my site and help me figure out why my map wont get destroyed? Im using google maps jquery plugin and the gmap('destroy') wont work. here is the site if you want to give it a shot http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[04:19:42] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone have any experience with flot?
[04:19:48] <jita> Trudko, it doesnt work for me :(
[04:20:32] <Trudko> jita try to reset filter http://jsfiddle.net/hQJ32/5/ it does work
[04:21:08] <nFFFF> Webb34, no ones going to trawl through your site, to do your homework for you....
[04:21:16] <jita> Trudko, its not jquery, the reset is the html input type reset, so jquery does not load
[04:22:32] <Trudko> jita, you have in your code  $('#filter_reset').click(function() { which set listener for that button if Jquery would not load this would not work
[04:29:09] <LordThumper> Hey, why doesn't .keypress work when attached to a div?
[04:29:28] <Cork> LordThumper: the element need to take focus
[04:29:40] <Cork> add tabindex="0" to the element
[04:29:59] <LordThumper> will try that, thanks :)
[04:30:02] <Trudko> guys I have a link which I disable, but if I add listener using click, disabling does not work I need to use delegate, I dont uderstand why http://jsfiddle.net/bUKNU/4/. How so?
[04:30:15] <Cork> LordThumper: and i the element dosn't have focus, it still won't know
[04:34:16] <jeffsmykil> this is extrmely frustrating, I need this format: [[-373597200000, 315.71], [-370918800000, 317.45]] but I keep ending up with this one: [["1330318800000,14"], ["1330322400000,14"]
[04:35:04] <Cork> jeffsmykil: what are you adding?
[04:35:13] <Cork> + to the array
[04:35:14] <Clex> jeffsmykil: show us some code.
[04:35:42] <jeffsmykil> Cork the first one is the hard code that makes the flot graph work, the second is my attempt to create data like the hard code from ajax object
[04:36:06] <Cork> jeffsmykil: i didn't mean explain
[04:36:09] <jeffsmykil> so my code looks like this
[04:36:11] <jeffsmykil> tempArray.push([newDate + "," + parseInt(temp[i].Temperature)]);
[04:36:23] <Cork> uh...
[04:36:42] <Cork> tempArray.push([newDate, parseInt(temp[i].Temperature)]);
[04:36:51] <Cork> should give you want you want
[04:37:19] <jeffsmykil> if it does I will kiss you
[04:37:32] * Cork hides
[04:37:38] * jeffsmykil looks for Cork
[04:37:44] <jeffsmykil> COME HERE FOR YOUR BIG KISS
[04:39:22] <jeffsmykil> man I struggled with that for like five hours yesterday
[04:40:25] <maxw> I have a quick question re some js code that is stopping my button clicks from working. I wonder if anyone can advise.
[04:40:31] <Cork> jeffsmykil: if you don't want a string don't use + "" + :)
[04:40:42] <Cork> that will always give you a string
[04:40:43] <jeffsmykil> cork i guess not huh?
[04:40:57] <Symbi0nt|GER> maxw: onclick="return false;"
[04:41:51] <jeffsmykil> Cork you made my day man
[04:41:59] <jeffsmykil> if you are ever in NH beers for you
[04:42:00] <Cork> heh, np :)
[04:42:30] <maxw> Symbi0nt|GER: no, that's not the code...it is somewhat unrelated code I run in order to replace a bunch of strings in the dom. For some reason, it works if I run it on ready, but if I delay it (using a timeout) it stops the clicks of my button from working.
[04:42:37] <snagnever> hey! i have a timer that checks for a json value on a ajax request. do i have to care about memory usage?
[04:42:50] <jeffsmykil> i have a feeling though that you are a european
[04:43:25] <Cork> snagnever: as long as you make sure all variables are declared you should be safe
[04:43:39] <Cork> jeffsmykil: so true :)
[04:44:15] <jeffsmykil> irish Cork?
[04:44:23] <Cork> sweden
[04:44:27] <maxw> Symbi0nt|GER: make any sense?
[04:44:33] <snagnever> Cork humn, if they area, the GC will take care;  If not, it probably will leak?
[04:45:12] <Cork> snagnever: gc will only release memory if nothing is refering to the object
[04:45:40] <Cork> so when the scope goes, everything declared in it goes
[04:45:59] <Cork> (unless another variable referes to the same object)
[04:46:50] <jeffsmykil> cork say hello to the good chef for me!
[04:47:05] <Cork> heh bork bork :)
[04:47:26] <snagnever> humn... i have a simply request wrapper https://gist.github.com/3fd615229375628c2cce, probably it wont give me problems, right? just take a look :P cause it's used by every ajax request i make
[04:48:17] <Cork> invalid = arguments[4]; <<- problematic
[04:48:45] <snagnever> yeah, just noticed...
[04:48:54] <snagnever> corrected now
[04:49:20] <Cork> but ya, except for that it looks fine
[04:49:35] <ravenzz> where is the timer?
[04:49:48] <snagnever> the computer here has 4GB of mem (and virtual mem was off), and i left it on during the night with some of my pages opened... today i came here and received 'out of mem' messages
[04:50:40] <snagnever> ravenzz https://gist.github.com/a6f8f743b8851bcb103b the timer is here, but is harder to understand cause some stuff is on portuguese
[04:51:44] <ravenzz> it is an huge amount of code actually
[04:51:49] * ravenzz lazy
[04:51:52] <ravenzz> are you trying to catch a success status?
[04:51:52] <snagnever> yeah, and that too :P
[04:52:13] <snagnever> no, the timer actually is to check for new discussions/replies
[04:52:18] <snagnever> just like facebook does
[04:52:28] <ravenzz> mh
[04:52:37] <ravenzz> these are the so called realtime apps
[04:52:38] <ravenzz> :p
[04:52:44] <thirdknife> i want the id of previous ancho tag , to which is currenly clicked?
[04:52:47] <ravenzz> you could rely on 3rd party services
[04:52:51] <thirdknife> how can that be done?
[04:52:58] <thirdknife> anchor*
[04:53:13] <ravenzz> ?prev @ thinced
[04:53:14] <bot-t> thinced, .prev([selector]): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[04:53:20] <ravenzz> thirdknife
[04:53:28] <thirdknife> alert(jQuery.(this).prev().find('a.list-item')); ?
[04:53:51] <thirdknife> selector format ravenzz ?
[04:54:04] <ravenzz> $(this).prev('a') ?
[04:54:19] <ravenzz> .attr('id') of course
[04:54:29] <thirdknife> k let me try
[04:54:49] <Cork> prev will only get the direct previus sibling though
[04:54:54] <snagnever> hey, netbeans usually puts a differente color on non-declared javascript variables, but the color theme i'm using doesnt. would any of you know the name of that "variable type" so i can change on the color theme?
[04:55:12] <Cork> thirdknife, ravenzz:  it won't get it if its another element inbetween
[04:55:32] <thirdknife> like if there is td it wont give me?
[04:55:37] <ravenzz> Cork correct, He got a link that should read :p
[04:55:42] <ravenzz> thirdknife no
[04:56:21] <Cork> <a></a><span></span><div></div>  $('div').prev('a).length == 0
[04:56:29] <Cork> * <a></a><span></span><div></div>  $('div').prev('a').length == 0
[04:57:13] <thinced> bot-t: thanks :)
[04:57:14] * bot-t sighs
[04:57:27] <Cork> ravenzz: thats not why i said it; its a fact that many miss, so i try to inform about it when i see ppl using prev/next
[04:58:03] <snagnever> 'Global Variable' in case some want to know
[04:58:11] <Cork> (the alternative that gives the effect ppl think they get with ex. prev('a') is nextAll and prevAll)
[04:59:17] <Cork> snagnever: or you can use "use strict"; and the browser will eat you if you leav variables undeclared :)
[04:59:28] <Cork> **leave
[04:59:33] <ravenzz> Cork sure. It is ok
[05:00:41] <ravenzz> Cork anyway even prevAll won't work
[05:01:04] <thirdknife> ravenzz, yeah it gives emty
[05:01:05] <Cork> if they'r not siblings sure
[05:01:07] <thirdknife> empty
[05:01:20] <Cork> thirdknife: you have a link?
[05:01:31] <thirdknife> link ?
[05:01:32] <snagnever> Cork how do i use "use strict"?
[05:01:50] <thirdknife> console.log(jQuery(this).prev('a.list-item'));
[05:01:54] <Cork> snagnever: set "use strict"; first thing in the js file
[05:02:02] <Cork> thirdknife: to what your trying to do
[05:02:14] <thirdknife> no its on my local machine
[05:02:32] <ravenzz> thirdknife jsfiddle.net paste here a markup snippet
[05:02:39] * Cork nods
[05:02:41] <thirdknife> okay
[05:02:42] <snagnever> bizarre, is literally string "use strict"
[05:02:59] <Cork> snagnever: yes
[05:03:06] <Cork> ?g "use strict"
[05:03:07] <bot-t> Cork, strict - perldoc.perl.org - http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html
[05:03:10] <ravenzz> I have to go
[05:03:11] <ravenzz> bye
[05:03:19] <Cork> ?g javascript "use strict"
[05:03:19] <bot-t> Cork, syntax - What does "use strict" do in javascript, and what is the ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it
[05:03:25] <snagnever> thanks a lot!
[05:04:07] <snagnever> beatifull
[05:04:17] <snagnever> i really love javascript
[05:04:21] <snagnever> it is so magic
[05:04:22] <snagnever> :P
[05:04:41] <Cork> "use strict"; is actually meant to remove some of the magic
[05:05:36] <fotoflo> hmm. is there a good way to download all the jquery docs?
[05:06:22] <nebiros> fotoflo: jqapi.com? I guess you can download it
[05:06:56] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/hSaen/
[05:07:13] <r3v3rb> how can i stop the above from blipping the images on rollover
[05:08:32] <fotoflo> wget -r api.jquery.com ?
[05:08:43] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/hSaen/1/ shows the html too - sorry
[05:11:57] <ShawnRisk> if I am trying to use Â jQuery("body.i18n-fr input[id='edit-community--2']").val("Tapez votre communaut&eacute; ..."); to translate a piece of code in drupal, how come the &eacute; is coming out as &eacute; and not Ã©?
[05:12:49] <Cork> ShawnRisk: javascript is unicode
[05:12:49] <xec> ShawnRisk: html entities only work in html
[05:13:08] <Cork> &eacute; is html entity
[05:13:17] <ShawnRisk> well there is no way to make this work?
[05:13:36] <Cork> you can evaluate the html entity and grab the result
[05:13:55] <Cork> $('<div/>').html('&eacute;').text()
[05:14:32] <ShawnRisk> let me try
[05:15:03] <denemetest> function Add2BetList( type, id, content) {
[05:15:05] <denemetest> 				var result = $.post(
[05:15:07] <denemetest> 									"request.php",
[05:15:09] <denemetest> 									{'type': type, 'id': id, 'content': content},
[05:15:10] <denemetest> 									.success(function() { alert("success"); })
[05:15:12] <denemetest> 							);
[05:15:13] <denemetest> 			}
[05:15:21] <Cork> ?p @ denemetest
[05:15:21] <bot-t> denemetest, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:15:38] <denemetest> what is wrong that function ?
[05:15:53] <Cork> denemetest: don't past code in the channel
[05:15:55] <Cork> EVER
[05:15:56] <ShawnRisk> Cork like this var text = $('<div/>').html('&eacute;').text(); but how would I put the variable in the .val()?
[05:15:56] <r3v3rb> cork any idea on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hSaen/1/
[05:16:32] <r3v3rb> i want the image to swap and fade in - but i get a brief 'blip'
[05:16:37] <r3v3rb> of blankness
[05:17:28] <denemetest> sorry for my last action !
[05:17:42] <denemetest> http://jsfiddle.net/FN2pR/
[05:17:42] <Cork> r3v3rb: might be cause the image gets display:none when you faceOut?
[05:17:53] <Cork> (hard to tell as you don't have any images in the pb)
[05:18:03] <r3v3rb> ok i'll add a few
[05:18:05] <denemetest> i am sending a request to result.php
[05:18:36] <Cork> denemetest: result will be the xhr object, not the returned value
[05:21:55] <denemetest> Cork: probably function is not working
[05:22:11] <fotoflo> 	$('#element').mouseenter(function(){  $(this).fadeIn();  });	
[05:22:16] <fotoflo> is there a shorter way to write this?
[05:22:36] <r3v3rb> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/hSaen/3/
[05:22:39] <Cork> denemetest: and you have .success in the $.post pbject
[05:22:43] <Cork> denemetest: thats not valid
[05:22:47] <r3v3rb> doesn't seem to work at all in fiddle though !
[05:22:59] <r3v3rb> works on localhost just get the fadeout you mention
[05:23:34] <Cork> r3v3rb: http://jsfiddle.net/hSaen/4/
[05:23:58] <Cork> r3v3rb: whats the glitch your talking about?
[05:23:58] <denemetest> Cork my bad thank you for showing that1
[05:24:00] <r3v3rb> Cork: thats what i get, but dont want
[05:24:01] <r3v3rb> :D
[05:24:37] <denemetest> is there any method for post data and grab results ?
[05:24:44] <snagnever> hey, is there a free plugin for image zooming with control? +/-?
[05:24:49] <Cork> r3v3rb: you want it to fade from one image to the other without fading to white?
[05:24:53] <r3v3rb> get a white blip, i want the new image to just fade in above the other whilst hovered
[05:25:00] <snagnever> i've searched a lot on google, but i couldn't find
[05:25:08] <Cork> denemetest: the third argument to $.post
[05:25:08] <r3v3rb> possible Cor?
[05:25:15] <r3v3rb> Cork: even*
[05:25:26] <Cork> denemetest: it takes a function(data) where data is your response
[05:25:41] <Cork> r3v3rb: you need to use two img tags
[05:25:51] <r3v3rb> ok
[05:25:56] <Cork> have the new image below the other
[05:25:59] <r3v3rb> not a substitue
[05:26:00] <Cork> and fade the top most image
[05:26:10] <r3v3rb> hmmm
[05:26:13] <Cork> substitue means you can only show one image at a time
[05:26:14] <synax> has anyone had any success using event delegation w/ Google Maps?
[05:26:39] <r3v3rb> Cork: so need to css them over each other correct?
[05:26:47] <Cork> yes
[05:26:57] <Cork> r3v3rb: or use image2 as a background
[05:27:02] <synax> I've got a handler attached to document.body that isn't catching any events from within my map
[05:27:12] <Cork> r3v3rb: and set opacity on the top most image instead
[05:27:56] <Cork> r3v3rb: <a style="background-image:url();"><img src="url" style="opacity:0"></a>
[05:28:15] <maxw> Symbi0nt|GER: I reduced the problem to just a couple of files and put it on jsfiddle. Can you comment? http://jsfiddle.net/7pEse/3/
[05:28:18] <denemetest> so  $.post("test.php", { POST_CONTENT}, myfunction(??));
[05:28:31] <Cork> yes
[05:28:32] <maxw> or anyone else, of course: http://jsfiddle.net/7pEse/3/
[05:28:38] <denemetest> thenn how can i pass grabbed data to myfunction
[05:28:49] <Cork> denemetest: $.post("test.php", { POST_CONTENT}, myfunction(data) { alert(data) });
[05:28:56] <Trudko> guys I have a link which I disable, but if I add listener using click, disabling does not work I need to use delegate, I dont uderstand why http://jsfiddle.net/bUKNU/4/. How so?
[05:28:57] <Cork> denemetest: you can't
[05:29:05] <Cork> denemetest: you have to use callback structure
[05:29:20] <r3v3rb> cork nice
[05:29:22] <bibo360> l'o
[05:29:24] <denemetest> i hate callback structure
[05:29:37] <denemetest> because i dont know how to use
[05:29:48] <Cork> denemetest: or you can return the xhr object from ajax
[05:29:57] <Cork> and use .success(function() {});
[05:30:06] <Cork> but thats still a callback structure
[05:30:12] <denemetest> thank you cork i think i have to go read some manual !
[05:30:42] <Cork> denemetest: ajax is async, that means the success function is called AFTER the function you wrap it in ends
[05:30:45] <synax> Trudko: don't return false from your listener function
[05:30:49] <Cork> so its imposible to return that value there
[05:31:34] <bibo360> i have found bug in latest jquery ui and want to confirm it
[05:31:39] <bibo360> please someone, open http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/scroll.html and drag objects vertically. And watch your draggable moving away from your mouse pointer...
[05:32:01] <synax> Trudko: another thing: 'disabled' isn't a valid property for a link
[05:32:02] <bibo360> (disclaimer : it works in chrome but not in other browsers)
[05:32:09] <synax> so setting it to true/false won't do anything
[05:32:46] <bibo360> there are bug reports about that but none has even an answer ...
[05:33:00] <r3v3rb> Cork
[05:33:03] <r3v3rb> ;)
[05:33:44] <Cork> r3v3rb?
[05:33:46] <Trudko> synax yeah I can't really change the code for disabling the link it is outside my influence
[05:34:00] <synax> Trudko: the code is invalid, so that's your issue
[05:34:35] <r3v3rb> Cork substituted you background-image and get a complete blank now until I set the opacity on the IMG tag to anything other than zero
[05:34:57] <bibo360> is there someone of jquery[ui] team in this channel ?
[05:37:30] <denemetest> Cork you said .success is not valid in $.post  but i found a document http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/  and they used .success evet :s i am confused
[05:37:32] <Trudko> synax:  that might be true in pseudo code, but that does not answer my question does it? It's not like I have syntax error .
[05:37:59] <synax> no, it's not just true in pseudo codeâit's true in the real world as well
[05:38:03] <r3v3rb> Cork: colour image is to fade in over bw, am i right that colour goes in IMG and bw in <A>
[05:38:06] <synax> setting "disabled" on an anchor does nothing
[05:38:11] <synax> so I'm not sure what you're expecting
[05:38:50] <synax> the only HTML elements I'm aware of that use "disabled" are form elements and <link/> elements
[05:41:20] <Trudko> synax: that is ok , but my question is(maybe I was not clear) if I click on link and use delegate clicking link wont fire click function when I use link.function it does
[05:41:48] <synax> my mistake
[05:42:16] <Cork> r3v3rb: http://jsfiddle.net/hSaen/7/
[05:43:08] <r3v3rb> thanks cork, i'll switch to html5
[05:43:24] <r3v3rb> had been thinking of using html4 for backwards compat
[05:43:31] <Cork> r3v3rb: btw you want to use mouseenter and mouseleave instead of over and out
[05:43:36] <synax> Trudko: this works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/bUKNU/12/
[05:44:25] <Cork> r3v3rb: as it is now you will get an mouseout when you hover the img child
[05:44:33] <Cork> *get a mouseout
[05:44:39] <r3v3rb> ok
[05:46:33] <Trudko> synax yeah but that is not code I have. As I said I am disabling link(which is not done by my code, and I can't changed that) and link will be disabled in sense that click fire wont anchor if I add click listener using delegate but if I use click() function , link will fire anchor...
[05:46:53] <Trudko> not sure If I make my self clear.
[05:47:15] <johanhar_> How would an expression like this become? "Give me all a-tags that got no class" ?
[05:49:02] <Cork> $('a:not([class])')
[05:49:04] <sjobidoo> Is there a simple way to get the height of a img which is reside inside:  tr > td > img   and then set the same height to the parent <td> ? :) there are multiple occurances of the same classes which always have the same structure..so would need to set the height for each of the td's which reside inside the tr with this class :)
[05:49:08] <johanhar_> Cork: thanks
[05:49:08] <Cork> not a grate selector thoguh
[05:52:05] <vladyn> how can access the index in each loop ?
[05:52:28] <Cork> .each(function(index) {}) ?
[05:52:34] <Cork> ?.each
[05:52:35] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:52:39] <r3v3rb> Cork: does the data-hover have to be an absolute URL then ?
[05:52:48] <Cork> r3v3rb: no
[05:53:04] <vladyn> ah Cork
[05:53:05] <Cork> its the same as what you normally put into background-image: url()
[05:53:07] <vladyn> many thanks
[05:53:08] <r3v3rb> hmm, on here get bw, but on hover blank - code shows correct path
[05:53:30] <Cork> r3v3rb: check the css section
[05:53:37] <Cork> display: inline-block; is vital
[05:53:57] <Cork> else the a tag won't have any dimentions
[05:54:03] <Cork> so won't write any background
[05:54:03] <r3v3rb> shoot missed it. couldnt see the wood for the trees
[05:54:09] <r3v3rb> :)
[05:54:59] <r3v3rb> Cork: perfect thanks !
[06:02:32] <hazamonzo> Hello folks. Still get used to selectors.. How might i get the text from the text tag within this div SVG ? http://wstaw.org/m/2012/02/28/plasma-desktopP19105.jpg
[06:07:56] <csarmi_> Hello, can someone tell me if it is possible to get the 'computer name' by jquery, and if yes, how?
[06:08:21] <jigz> no
[06:09:00] <amitprakash> How do I find out if a certain #id div exists in the document?
[06:09:15] <jigz> if( $('#id').length )
[06:09:27] <amitprakash> thanks
[06:10:32] <fris> you want .length>0
[06:10:38] <csarmi_> so if I would like to identify the computer it is being run on, I'd best use a cookie?
[06:10:54] <nitrospectide> I am creating a multi-element rollover animation, and I want to know: can I introduce a delay on certain items so that they don't move until xx milliseconds after the hover event? Here is my code: http://pastie.org/3480149
[06:10:57] <jigz> fris: 0 is false, so if length === 0, then it would fail.. its just a shorthand
[06:11:33] <jigz> you probably knew that... i am sorry
[06:11:43] <fris> thats why i said greater than 0, but i guess the other way would work i never did it without >
[06:11:59] <Guddu> Dear all...I am trying to make a fiddle at http://jsfiddle.net/8excC/8/ but the change method is not kicking in.... It is associated with the selector $('table#register').on('change','td#reg_item_qty input#quantity',function(event)

[06:13:33] <bot-t> nFFFF: SyntaxError: return not in function
[06:14:12] <Guddu> jigz, I am confused now....This actually works for me when i run this inside application. There was another problem for which I was trying to build this fiddle and there it does not work.
[06:14:15] <thomb> is it possible to continue within an $.each loop?
[06:14:18] <nFFFF> ?eval if(true)
[06:14:19] <bot-t> nFFFF: SyntaxError: syntax error
[06:15:06] <Guddu> jigz, Per the documents The change event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements. So this should work
[06:15:37] <Guddu> As I am doing it on a Input element
[06:20:28] <Guddu> Would anyone have some idea?
[06:20:28] <Trudko> guys I have a link which I disable, but if I add listener using click, disabling does not work I need to use delegate, I dont uderstand why http://jsfiddle.net/bUKNU/4/
[06:20:33] <jigz> Guddu: proof of concept http://jsfiddle.net/PK6y4/1/
[06:20:42] <Guddu> jigz, Checking
[06:21:39] <jigz> Guddu: so in this example, i think you probably want to use keydown ?
[06:21:51] <jigz> Guddu: probably keyup
[06:22:28] <jigz> Trudko: how are you disabling?
[06:22:36] <tankblergh> Hi! What is the best way to filter keypress/keydown/keyup events input that works in IE/firefox/chrome?
[06:22:52] <Trudko> jigz: it is code, it is not standard and I have no access to it..
[06:22:55] <Guddu> jigz, IN my application, this works fine without using keydown or keyup. I just extracted parts from my HTML to create this fiddle to explain another problem that i had and it so turns out that my fiddle is not working. Each time when i change the Quantity in the Text Box, the total to receive should increase. Looks like the code isnot kicking in
[06:23:18] <tankblergh> I tried e.originalEvent.char, but this doesnt exist in chrome
[06:24:07] <tankblergh> seems like e.keyCpde and e.charCode have switched usage between IE and firefox too
[06:24:27] <tankblergh> sorry, I meant the originalEvent.char doesnt exist in firefox
[06:25:13] <jigz> Guddu: sorry fk
[06:25:15] <jigz> *afk
[06:25:48] <Guddu> jigz, afk?
[06:27:44] <Guddu> I have pasted another fiddle. Mor shortened version. http://jsfiddle.net/8excC/12/ The event selector code is still not kicking in
[06:30:12] <Slaythern> hi, how to use toggle in my  drupal site?
[06:32:06] <jary> morning all, I've been looking at some code with ajax handlers being hung off the object rather than parameterized as settings, so $.ajax().success().error() as opposed to $.ajax(success: and error:)
[06:32:36] <jary> best I can tell, they're just overriding the handler in the first style, is there any reason it should be parameterized instead?
[06:32:51] <jary> or is it simply 2 ways to get at the same result?
[06:33:33] <danzik17> jary: just 2 ways to get the same result.  both map to the Done/Failed deferreds that are resolved behind the scenes.
[06:33:52] <danzik17> but he should be using .done and .fail, not .success and .error
[06:34:00] <niftylettuce> Looking for an open source browser extension development framework -- trying to find an alternative to http://crossfire.com or kangoextensions.com -- any advice?
[06:34:28] <jigz> Guddu: ok, first problem is multiple elements have the same id, id in a document must be unique
[06:34:34] <jary> danzik17: ok, thanks, I'll look into those just for my own clarity
[06:38:00] <Guddu> jigz, http://jsfiddle.net/8excC/13/
[06:38:49] <Guddu> jigz, Even with same id, it seems to work fine when i use this in my WEB Application...Because inside the event handler I am using $(this)
[06:39:17] <Guddu> The only problem is that it does not work in fiddle....I am trying to make it work in fiddle so that I could explain another problem that i had
[06:39:18] <jigz> im just editting the fiddle
[06:40:48] <tra> what is the best jquery plugin for pagination?
[06:45:54] <Xotix> How do i build a string like this with jQuer/JS? 'foo' + $(input).val() + 'bar';
[06:45:57] <sphinxxx> anyone good with the html5 boilerplate build script?
[06:46:25] <sphinxxx> when it minifies all the js, its not keeping the order, thus breaking some plugins
[06:46:30] <mathi> hi
[06:48:28] <mathi> how do I know if an element is in the page or not?  for example $('<p></p>')   is not yet inserted in the page
[06:49:02] <jigz> if( $('#id').length )
[06:49:04] <Trudko> mathi use .length
[06:50:05] <jigz> Guddu: if you are using an ID for every single element, there really is no need to traverse the dom using elements and IDs
[06:50:14] <Trudko> Xotix: what do you mean? are you asking about concation of strings? and why do you write Jquery/JS like if jquery was programming language
[06:50:17] <mathi> jigz, Trudko this would return true, though I didn't insert it:   var test = $('<p></p>'); console.log(test.length);
[06:50:30] <mathi> (would return 1)
[06:50:37] <Guddu> jigz, What should be my approach then?
[06:50:45] <Trudko> yes which means element is in dom
[06:50:50] <jigz> because <p></p> generates the elements, where $('p') would check if <p> exists
[06:51:39] <mathi> jigz, so how to know that an element is in DOM without being inserted in the page?
[06:51:42] <jigz> Guddu: still working on it
[06:51:47] <Guddu> Thanks jigz
[06:52:07] <Xotix> Trudko, got it. What's wrong building a string with js? I need it for some templating reason. I know there are whole JS tmp engines, but i just need a little preview where i need to build a string. Nothing big.
[06:52:35] <Trudko> I am not saying there is anything wrong with building string with js
[06:52:41] <jigz> mathi: if( $('p').length > 0){ }
[06:53:21] <mathi> jigz, $('<p></p>').length returns 1, ok it IS in the DOM, it has been generated, but it is not in my HTML elements anywhere
[06:54:27] <mathi> I would like to know if a div is on the actual page, or is only in DOM
[06:55:03] <hurry> can i do BeforeSend with $.post() ?
[06:55:26] <jigz> if( $('p').length ){ //no el is in dom }else{ $('<p></p>').append('body') }
[06:55:30] <Hooloovoo> it's in the dom if you just created it?
[06:55:43] <jigz> i did the else backwards
[06:55:49] <jigz> no
[06:56:02] <Hooloovoo> good, i thought i had gone insane
[06:56:46] <jigz> hurry: you have to either use .ajaxBeforeSend() or .ajax with parameters
[06:57:08] <hurry> jigz: ajaxBeforeSend this is for All call right?
[06:57:33] <hurry> yes i know that .ajax, i can't do Before with $.post
[06:57:39] <mathi> jigz, let's say I have a var containing a jquery object, I don't know if it has been inserted or not. in both cases it returns 1 for .length
[06:59:14] <snagnever> mathi check for its parent
[06:59:26] <snagnever> $obj.parent().length
[06:59:41] <mathi> thank you I'll try that
[07:00:11] <mathi> it returns 0, that's good
[07:00:17] <evantravers> are any of the zurb folks hanging out in here?
[07:00:38] <jigz> hurry: i'm not the most up to date with jQXHR, maybe someone can help you
[07:00:40] <Hooloovoo> evantravers: zurb?
[07:00:49] <hurry> thanks jigz
[07:00:59] <evantravers> www.zurb.com... some of them occasionally hang in here.
[07:01:21] <evantravers> I have an unrelated question to their css grid system.
[07:01:27] <evantravers> was hoping to get in touch w/ one of them.
[07:07:04] <jigz> Guddu: if you are wanting to restrict the input to numerical only, I recommend a plugin
[07:07:28] <Guddu> jigz, Which one?
[07:08:17] <jigz> the inputs
[07:08:39] <Guddu> Jigz which plugin?
[07:10:24] <jigz> almost have it..
[07:11:06] <izz_> hey guys I'm having some problems with the tablesorter plugin, not sure if this is the right place to ask..
[07:11:38] <bartmax> i have a $( selector ).live('click', someFunction ); when a item triggers the click, i want to die('click') on that item but not on the entire selector... is there any way to accomplish that ?
[07:12:11] <snagnever> bartmax i guess live() is deprecated
[07:12:11] <izz_> I'm replacing *all* tr:s in a tbody with an ajax call, and it seems like no combination of trigger("update") and trigger("appendCache") makes it work right
[07:12:18] <FPtje> Hey I've got a problem. Running jQuery("#element").load("page.html", function(){}) causes a jQuery error in Internet Explorer. How can I possibly make a workaround for this?
[07:12:19] <snagnever> you should use on/off now
[07:12:27] <bartmax> snagnever: yes, but it's on ms ajax mvc3 libraries.
[07:12:31] <Trudko> FPtje: whats he error
[07:12:32] <bartmax> http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/mvc/3.0/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js
[07:12:33] <bartmax> :(
[07:12:35] <bartmax> unfortunatelly
[07:12:47] <bartmax> either way, .on / .off have the same problem i 'think' ?
[07:13:05] <FPtje> Trudko: Message: Unexpected call to method or property access.Line: 5763
[07:13:15] <snagnever> oh i see. probably.
[07:13:42] <Trudko> FPtje: we need code, have you tried to debug it?
[07:14:04] <bartmax> mmm, interesting.. remove the class from the element doesn't trigger the event anymore. i see why live is deprecated :D
[07:14:28] <FPtje> Trudko: I have. It originates from a catch clausule in the jQuery extend function
[07:15:00] <FPtje> Trudko: On this page: http://www.students.science.uu.nl/~3749002/www/ script.js line 16
[07:15:13] <FPtje> I can upload the code itself if you like
[07:15:28] <FPtje> But the page can't be loaded in IE9 because of that error
[07:17:01] <FPtje> Trudko: The script itself can be found here: http://www.students.science.uu.nl/~3749002/www/js/script.js
[07:17:23] <Trudko> FPtje: and its on line 49 inside of script 16?
[07:17:58] <FPtje> The error is in jQuery.js
[07:18:16] <FPtje> Trudko: The call is on line 16. Commenting out line 16 gets rid of the error
[07:19:12] <Xotix> FPtje: always write english comments
[07:19:22] <FPtje> Xotix: I should
[07:19:28] <Xotix> and code :)

[07:21:47] <blazento> hey, shoudl $('select').val(optionValue); trigger a change event?
[07:22:09] <jigz> no
[07:22:29] <blazento> so after doing that i should do trigger('change') explicitly for the intended behavior?
[07:23:18] <Gozzy> yes but tias
[07:23:26] <Gozzy> try it and see
[07:23:35] <FPtje> whoa what

[07:31:40] <Guddu> Thanks jigz Checking now
[07:31:52] <poppiez> I have a bunch of <div class="whatever">test</div> inside a document fragment. is there any neat way of separating every fourth div in a wrapper like <div class="wrapper"></div> before appending it to the DOM?
[07:32:36] <FPtje_> Trudko: Any idea how I can solve this? Does IE9 not support element.load?
[07:32:55] <Guddu> jigz, That is simple awsome :)
[07:33:39] <Guddu> What a beauty of a code )
[07:33:41] <Guddu> :)
[07:33:55] <Xotix> poppiez maybe with nth-child() but i'm not sure. didn't use it for a long time.
[07:34:16] <Guddu> jigz, Could i use parseInt instead of parseFLoat....We are not allowing decimals over there anyways?
[07:34:24] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance JS/Node.js developer?
[07:34:25] <jigz> poppiez: $('.whatever:nth-child(4n)').each( function(i, e){ $(this).outside('<div class="wrapper"></div>') });
[07:35:15] <poppiez> jigz: outside?
[07:35:46] <jigz> sorry, outside should be wrap()
[07:35:51] <JuJuBee> I am having trouble with some js and not sure where to look.  My page works in FF but not in Chrome.  I am looking at the console in Chrome and pasted the output to http://pastebin.com/3pQ0awwZ  but in FF I get no errors.  Any help learning how to debug would be appreciated.
[07:36:36] <DerekPioneer> i'm having a weird bug where ie only reacts to hovers on divs if i hover directly over the div's border. i'm creating the hover inside of a domready
[07:36:39] <poppiez> jigz: can you do something like $(docFrag).find(':nth-child(4n)')?
[07:36:49] <jigz> i think so
[07:36:59] <poppiez> jigz: will give it a go. thx a lot!
[07:37:02] <jigz> np
[07:39:42] <jigz> poppiez: the wrap might need to be:    .wrap('<div class="wrapper" />');
[07:40:56] <microhxo> How can i remove a class from the second TH of a class?
[07:41:05] <Xotix> how can i get the input a user makes in a contenteditable div? e.g. to filter it.
[07:41:26] <Xotix> $()-eq(2).removeClass()
[07:41:49] <microhxo> Thanks xotix
[07:42:39] <poppiez> jigz: I think I didn't explain myself too well. what I want is to group elements in a wrapper. first four should be wrapped, next four should be wrapped and so forth
[07:42:44] <Xotix> microhxo: Hope i understanded it correctly. $(class th).eq(2).removeClass(); should work.
[07:43:13] <microhxo> I want to remove a checkbox that is in every 2nd th .
[07:45:16] <fotoflo> hmm. i have a really simple function :  function toPX( string ){ return parseInt(string.slice(0, -2));  }  -- how do i make this jquery chainable?
[07:45:16] <fotoflo> ?

[07:46:51] <shwaiil> hi
[07:47:47] <johnkpaul> fotoflo: it doesn't do anything with a jQuery obect or dom element, so why would you want it to be jquery chainable?
[07:48:26] <shwaiil> Q: Let's say I have <div class="parent"><span id="clickMe"></span></div>, while $('#clickMe').on('click'), i'd like to get it's parent html, parent > childs. I'm trying $('.parent').html() but I only get child. How to do that? THanks
[07:48:49] <johnkpaul> what do you mean "parent>childs"?
[07:48:55] <brettster> Hey guys.
[07:48:59] <johnkpaul> ideally what is the value that you want back shwaiil?
[07:49:08] <fotoflo> $myVid.css("left", toPX($myVid.css("width")) + toPX($myVid.css("margin-right") + toPX($myVid.css("margin-left")) );
[07:49:08] <D4> If I have a rectangular viewing area holding an image, and you can change image by moving < or >, how would I on the 2nd, 6th and perhaps 7th image only allow ^ and v navigation? Suggestions? The idea is to simulate a "labyrinth", so once you've navigated through this slider, the end image will be shown (if you've navigated succesfully)?
[07:49:13] <fotoflo> to clean that up...
[07:49:23] <johnkpaul> shwaiil: perhaps this will help - http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[07:49:32] <brettster> Is there a way to sniff out chrome and run a script only if the user is using chrome
[07:49:38] <__p__> function(data) {$('Coupon').replaceWith( data );}
[07:49:47] <johnkpaul> fotoflo: in that example, you _don't_ ned it to be chainable
[07:49:48] <shwaiil> johnkpaul: taks a lot
[07:49:48] <jigz> ?browser @ brettster
[07:49:49] <bot-t> brettster, jQuery.browser: Contains flags for the useragent, read from navigator.userAgent. We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser may be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[07:49:54] <johnkpaul> because toPX is the last call
[07:49:57] <Xotix> microhxo take a look at nth-child(2n) maybe something like this $(.class th).nth-child(2n).css('display', 'none');
[07:50:04] <SoulRaven> hi

[07:53:05] <jigz> gianiaz: from google: Whenever the toDataURL() method of a canvas element whose origin-clean flag is set to false is called, the method must raise a SECURITY_ERR exception.
[07:53:49] <gianiaz> jigz, I've found that, but it says that the origin-clean flag is set to false when images are not from the same domain, but mines are

If I set the selector to "td:not(:last-child)", it returns nothing and everything gets filtered. However, "td:last-child" works by searching only the last column.  Why isn't ":not()"? working in this case?

[08:12:13] <johnkpaul> treat it nice, and it will be good to you
[08:12:49] <jrockjiggz> __p__: $('#xx').html('<b>New Content</b>')
[08:12:50] <__p__> johnkpaul: it is slow !

[08:18:04] <jrockjiggz> not as variable, but as object
[08:18:26] <_markh_> I'm trying to add a click event handler to some icons. I have an object method that implememts a loop, which iterates over all icons of the correct class ("remove" in my case) and adds an anonymous fuction using the .click() method. The Anonymous func. references vars from the object method (not object members) but at evaluation (click) time those values always equate to the last iteration...
[08:18:28] <_markh_> ...of the adding loop. Example code in pastebin http://pastebin.com/jncf8qyY

[09:17:48] <jdalton> so I know jq allows duplicate event handlers since 1.4.2
[09:17:56] <jdalton> I like the added control it gives the user
[09:18:12] <jrockjiggz> adamramadhan: i would var $p = $('<p></p>').css( //add css ).html(data.description + '&mdash; something log here').appendTo('#ajax-test')
[09:18:16] <jdalton> though trying to argue for not filtering dups out of our own system and they won't accept (the overhead isn't worth it)
[09:18:30] <jdalton> any cool examples of using duplicate event handlers?
[09:18:35] <jarr0dsz> hey guys
[09:18:38] <jarr0dsz> how it going
[09:18:51] <jarr0dsz> im trying to fix some form selection but i cannot figure it out : ( http://jsfiddle.net/3Wn7q/ anyone might want to take a peek?
[09:19:00] <jarr0dsz> i know i can use closest somehow but expirimented a bit with it to no avail
[09:20:51] <dualcore> jarr0dsz: what is the issue
[09:20:54] <tomasm-> hi, is it somehow possible to have an event handler that shows a 'please wait' icon in place of a loading image, until it loads fully? I know I can have a load() handler for the image, but need to have an event fire before the image loads. maybe I can remove the src attribute before assigning the load() handler, then re-assign the src handler after it's bound? or is there a better way?
[09:21:07] <dev360> is there an event that I can hook into that would fire when I assign an object to the dom (via .append or whatever) ?
[09:21:11] <jarr0dsz> hi dualcore oh something rather simple but cannot seem to figure it out, try to submit a form based on closest div
[09:21:33] <dualcore> jarr0dsz: what do you mean based on the closest div?
[09:21:58] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/3Wn7q/ like there, 2 red divs
[09:22:01] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: look into beforeSend, i use this to add an img to the target DIV, then in success, load in my http results which replaces the existing img
[09:22:07] <jarr0dsz> i want to have an onclick event for the one selected only
[09:22:17] <jarr0dsz> and a form submit but i left that out in the example for ease
[09:22:38] <jarr0dsz> im not sure how i would use .closest of .parent on that
[09:22:54] <jarr0dsz> since i have like 60 profile divs
[09:23:09] <tomasm-> dev360, if you have control over the append, etc you can create a wrapper that triggers an event prior/after... otherwise maybe using on() if you want events on newly created objects.... but then again load() has a callback ability, once it's done
[09:23:26] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wn7q/2/
[09:23:37] <dualcore> i'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish exactly.  do you need an individual form for each profile?
[09:24:08] <dualcore> oh lol i overlooked that jrockjiggz
[09:24:10] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: a) your using ID more than once, b) your not closing your HTML elements, c)divs do not need <br> after because they are block elements
[09:24:14] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, isnt beforeSend used for ajax calls? i'm talking about all images in the main page, there are no ajax calls for loading snippets of content
[09:24:20] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: thx rather i have to have the divs be the same name im afraid
[09:24:41] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: use class then. id must be unique. no exception
[09:24:50] <dev360> tomasm: yeah the problem is I do have control over the append code, but I have this emerging anti pattern in my code where Im assigning backbone views with .append, but then I need to apply some jQuery plugin code once its bound to the dom. I was wondering if there would be a way to do this inside of my backbone view instead of after the append.
[09:25:25] <friendlycello> jarr0dsz: agreed on the duplicate id.  uses classes instead.  everything was designed around the notion that id's are unique.
[09:25:59] <dualcore> jarr0dsz: correct you cannot use duplicate ids
[09:26:18] <jarr0dsz> okay thx i change that, havent thought much about that i just created something basic
[09:26:20] <friendlycello> although unfortunately (forunately?) javascript is so lax that it will still work.
[09:27:22] <jarr0dsz> okay i changed the parts based on suggestions, only now confused how would i submit the closest form? perhaps my example wasent the best ;)

[09:27:31] <jarr0dsz> wait ill just update it more clear
[09:28:00] <tomasm-> do images still load if display:none; ?
[09:28:11] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: i read your question wrong.  why not just put <div>Please Wait...</div> in your html, then when the dom is ready, jquery will insert a loading img.
[09:29:05] <boonkerz> hello
[09:29:26] <boonkerz> i search an widget for m:n
[09:29:34] <boonkerz> anyone have an hint?
[09:29:44] <jrockjiggz> whats m:n?
[09:30:29] <jarr0dsz> okay this is basically what im trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wn7q/4/
[09:30:45] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, right now i am designing it so when I set the src of an image (sometimes programatically, sometimes naturally), it hides the img, clears the src attribute, adds a 'please wait' img afterward, then onload of the image, removes the please wait img and shows this image. we're talking going through an album of thumbnails and previewing a much larger picture that is delayed about 1 full second after clicking. I need some indicat
[09:30:45] <jarr0dsz> 2 divs, 2 forms and then when you click the div anywhere submit the form thats closest
[09:30:45] <tomasm-> or that it's working at something.
[09:31:03] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wn7q/5/
[09:31:37] <boonkerz> my problem is i have an image
[09:31:47] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: rather: http://jsfiddle.net/3Wn7q/6/
[09:31:54] <boonkerz> this should be insert in categories
[09:32:11] <boonkerz> but the the categories is an long list which sublevels
[09:32:18] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: cool its really not that difficult if you know the rigt commands
[09:32:38] <jarr0dsz> must say doing lots of jquery later im getting better at it ;p its very cool
[09:32:46] <tomasm-> jrockjiggz, it actually seems to work ok, just needs some styling....
[09:32:46] <jrockjiggz> :)
[09:32:50] <boonkerz> and i have not found any good solution to assign categories
[09:33:27] <boonkerz> i think an good solution: left the tree
[09:33:33] <boonkerz> right the selected items
[09:34:00] <boonkerz> and with click on an tree it is assign and listed in the right box
[09:34:35] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: you can pre-load images in javascript with new Image()

[09:35:54] <boonkerz> like his
[09:35:55] <boonkerz> this
[09:35:56] <boonkerz> http://www.ryancramer.com/projects/asmselect/examples/example1.html
[09:36:06] <boonkerz> but the selectbox must display an tree
[09:37:44] <jrockjiggz> tomasm-: $('img').on('click', function(){ $(this).hide().after('<p>loading</p>') }).load('getImg.php', function(data){ $(this).parent().html(data) });
[09:38:21] <tomasm-> hmmm
[09:39:01] <jrockjiggz> theres a few ways to approach it
[09:39:10] <jrockjiggz> brb

[09:44:57] <AdvoWork> Hi there, if my url shows: &auto_open_page=view_pos&purchase_order_number=16612#  how can i remove the text from that, or can't I?
[09:45:28] <jrockjiggz> AdvoWork: in the url bar?
[09:48:07] <AdvoWork> jrockjiggz, i need to remove that information, but without actually doing window.location = url;
[09:48:09] <kanzie> when I use extend, does it do deep extending? Like { foo: {bar: 'ff'} } + { no: 'cigar', foo: {hell: 'freeze-> { foo: {bar: 'ff', hell: 'freeze'}, no: 'cigar'}
[09:49:58] <kanzie> and if I do deep copy using extend, is that much more expensive than not doing deep copy? (should I refrain from doing it?)
[09:51:06] <jrockjiggz> AdvoWork: look into top.location.href
[09:53:10] <amalvagomes> Hey, I have a PHP function that generates a document and hands it back to the browser, how would I make the browser download that data from a jQuery post success function?

[09:54:40] <pifantastic> cook1es: is your pip script on a different domain?
[09:54:46] <pifantastic> php*
[09:54:54] <cook1es> pifantastic: yes
[09:55:22] <pifantastic> cook1es: that makes things a bit more difficult
[09:56:04] <AdvoWork> jrockjiggz, basically, im passing parameters for my page, such as section=test&jobnumber=12345  which works fine so when it loads test it goes to that jobnumber. The problem is, once they've done a task, that jobnumber is still present
[09:56:05] <pifantastic> cook1es: http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/cross_domain_aj
[09:56:05] <cook1es>  pifantastic: It has worked before, but I assume there should be a response sent without me returning anything specific in PHP?
[09:56:36] <pifantastic> cook1es: you will need to send a response that matches the type of data jquery.post is receiving
[09:56:49] <pifantastic> the content type header should be text/html or something similar
[09:57:18] <csarmi_home> Hello, I'm a noob to js. I'd like to off a timer once a specific element loads and set it off in 5 seconds. What's the best way to go about it?

[09:59:41] <cook1es> pifantastic: and what is actually a response? Is it a certain function or simply the sole content of the page? Can the page not have anything else than the posted data in it as text? sorry I am completely clueless on this.
[09:59:43] <jarr0dsz> if you use custom form_tag how would you correctly set its path ? im not want to use like @members but some '/custom/path/to/action'
[10:00:00] <jarr0dsz> seems if i just enter 'controller/action' it won't insert that path
[10:00:23] <jarr0dsz> ah wrong channel sorry about that ;)
[10:00:25] <poppiez> interesting observation: it seems the performance of .text() is really bad on iphone. I was inserting various strings using .text() at a fast pace and the iphone completely lagged. changed to .html() and now it's completely smooth

[10:46:35] <jarr0dsz> + load the content I need in expanded mode in with ajax, to have less html in the page ( only getting the content for expanded when a box is expanded)
[10:46:52] <jarr0dsz> any thought on that? how I could tackle it, got that jsfiddle together with some help last time here
[10:47:02] <ignite> jrockjiggz: I fixed it.  The cache function merges all the TD.innerHTML together before testing with testQuery().  Normally, the selector would return one element but with the selector I was using, it was returning an array, and queryTest() only checks the first element of the array.  I made a simple if t.length > 1 then  $.each() to build the string and throw it a simple array. Seems to works okay ;D
[10:48:00] <jrockjiggz> ignite: awesome, :)
[10:48:03] <Mkop> jarr0dsz: your current approach makes sense. jqueryui accordian widget might be another approach
[10:48:36] <ignite> jrockjiggz: just in case you were dying to know ;)   thanks again for your help
[10:48:59] <jrockjiggz> microhxo: you should add css to your EL so it is already set in a state before your JS loads.. simple style="display: none;" will work
[10:49:01] <Mkop> microhxo: just put display:none; in the css
[10:49:32] <jarr0dsz> i had some very strange issues with that jquery when implemented it in my rails app though
[10:49:46] <jarr0dsz> Mkop: coudent' i make some "states" and just switch between them?
[10:49:55] <jarr0dsz> having 2 complete divs 1 for collapsed and 1 for expanded
[10:49:59] <bartmax> one will work like on or live ? if i do $('#someFutureElement').one('click', doFunc); will work if someFutureElement loads AFTER the binding call is called ?
[10:50:03] <jarr0dsz> i really dont like all the divs inside divs
[10:50:23] <Mkop> jarr0dsz: yeah, easily
[10:50:52] <jarr0dsz> Mkop: what would you suggest on getting that done?
[10:51:03] <jarr0dsz> i have made update http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/9/ im also need to figgle in a .close there again
[10:51:09] <jarr0dsz> since the last box don't collapse/expand
[10:51:27] <jarr0dsz> basically want cleaner html and load content in with ajax that would be the nicest approach
[10:52:32] <xmaddness> Is it possible to call a plugin from within a plugin?
[10:54:44] <Mkop> jarr0dsz: http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/11/
[10:55:46] <Mkop> if you want fancy things like ajax, I recommend looking at jqueryui accordian. on a certain level you're reinventing the wheel
[10:55:48] <jarr0dsz> Mkop: thanks i see now how same error as before on my part
[10:57:39] <aqeel> hi room
[11:00:51] <jarr0dsz> hey
[11:01:15] <jarr0dsz> Mkop: i think its very interesting topic i just throw it on stackoverflow and see if there comes some more ideas suggestions on it
[11:02:00] <microhxo> jrockjiggz, mkop thank you.
[11:03:21] <ow1n> Is anyone here working with the alpha of the menu widget? I'm wondering whether it's expected that link hrefs aren't triggered on click by default?
[11:07:19] <kborchers> ow1n: not sure what you mean. do you have a demo?
[11:08:12] <boonkerz> is this the best plugin? http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/
[11:08:16] <ow1n> Hmm... I should've thrown one up before I asked...
[11:08:51] <kborchers> ow1n: if you have menu items with hrefs that are actual URL's, it should follow them
[11:17:12] <seion> he accordion Im using when it first loads it expands height wise the right height, but if after I click another tab on it and try to go back to that tab it doesnt expand the full height of whats in it.
[11:19:06] <DerekPioneer> i have a dropdown list inside of a draggable() div, inside the dropdown list there is a scrollbar. the scrollbar becomes unusable because the draggable div things that i'm dragging the div instead of the scrollbar. http://jsfiddle.net/J6ypP/
[11:20:11] <ow1n> Thanks kborchers, now I have to figure out why it's working in my demo but not in my project ;)
[11:20:33] <kborchers> ow1n: that's usually how it goes :)
[11:21:53] <jrockjiggz> DerekPioneer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3312680/how-to-disable-draggable-div-when-child-element-scrollbar-is-being-used
[11:22:02] <jarr0dsz> im trying to load in ajax with http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/14/
[11:22:19] <jarr0dsz> but it doesent seem to load in the external page, anyone can tell me whats wrong ? what ive missed
[11:22:30] <jarr0dsz> that example worked on another piece of my js but not in this jsfiddle
[11:22:31] <DerekPioneer> jrockjiggz: ty
[11:22:58] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: $('#expanded_content') is for an ID
[11:23:17] <jarr0dsz> ah damn yes your right totally missed that ;p
[11:23:23] <DerekPioneer> jrockjiggz: it also seems .draggable({cancel: '.dropdown'});  works
[11:24:04] <jarr0dsz> woud it then be     $('.expanded_content').load('http://www.nu.nl'); ? or im wrong again
[11:24:15] <jrockjiggz> jarr0dsz: http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/15/
[11:24:18] <jarr0dsz> and guess i also need to throw in closest there else it updates every div with that name
[11:25:06] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: okay with find i see lilke so =>     $(this).find('.expanded_content').load('http://www.nu.nl');
[11:25:25] <jarr0dsz> only it would not load or do you need to do different when getting an external url?
[11:25:28] <jrockjiggz> yes, but you will run into issues with cross-domain ajax
[11:25:29] <jarr0dsz> or maybe thats not possible at all
[11:25:44] <jarr0dsz> ah like that so i cannot load contents of another domain since i cannot include a "local" file in jsfiddle
[11:26:00] <jrockjiggz> tias
[11:26:29] <Engin> hey guys, offtopic question here: to add a few social sharing buttons, it takes shitloads of cross domain queries and slows the page down like hell...
[11:26:44] <Engin> i tested a few aggregation sites... i.e. they provide many buttons... they suck too
[11:27:13] <Engin> fastest way: popping up a sharing url in a window i.e. facebook.com/share.php?blblablal and user will do the stuff... but it is not very interactive... as it does not display how many shares yet etc
[11:27:25] <Engin> any techniques you use ?
[11:29:02] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: say you load that external html inside the expanded_div if you collapse again, it will be still there right?
[11:29:14] <jarr0dsz> would it possible to remove that loaded html true ajax also?
[11:34:19] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/17/ it not works in jsfiddle ;)
[11:34:37] <jarr0dsz> only i would love to remove the inserted html also if ontoggle to collapsed
[11:34:46] <jarr0dsz> is there some remove feature in jquery?
[11:35:06] <jarr0dsz> like $('.hello').remove();
[11:35:12] <rudyl313> how can I change the query params of my browser's current URL without loading the new location (i.e. location.search = "?new=params" is leading to a reload)
[11:35:57] <jarr0dsz> so i use     $(this).find('.expanded_content').remove(); but how would i do that inside a toggle?
[11:36:18] <jarr0dsz>     $(this).find('.expanded_content').remove(); need some way to get the toggle state then its working :D
[11:37:09] <seion> he accordion Im using when it first loads it expands height wise the right height, but if after I click another tab on it and try to go back to that tab it doesnt expand the full height of whats in it.
[11:39:13] <jarr0dsz> seion: your also working on an accordion?
[11:39:25] <jarr0dsz> looks like your markup is incorrent , the html
[11:39:37] <ribot> hi
[11:39:49] <jarr0dsz> how would i be able to check the state im in collapsed or expanded
[11:39:57] <jarr0dsz> i searched everywhere its the final bit to make it superb
[11:40:14] <ribot> is there a way to obtain a form element's value as it was when the page loaded, the value="" value?
[11:40:28] <jarr0dsz>     $(this).toggleClass("expanded collapsed"); then something if class = expanded do ...
[11:44:13] <pjeide> http://pastebin.com/rUA50XGK I am trying to figure out why a simple $.map() isn't working, any advice? http://pastebin.com/rUA50XGK
[11:44:18] <pjeide> oops, didn't mean to paste link twice.
[11:47:44] <jrockjiggz> pjeide: i dont see a problem? http://jsfiddle.net/zuHnU/
[11:51:54] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: could you please help me with 1 final thing? i found i need is.visible to check the toggle state but can't get it to work
[11:52:06] <jarr0dsz> would like to check toggle state and then use the .remove function to remove the html from a div
[11:52:52] <jarr0dsz> something like : http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/19/
[11:53:01] <jarr0dsz> only i think i flaslessly messup the right syntaxing
[11:53:46] <jrockjiggz> just () in: if()
[11:55:17] <seion> jarr0dsz: yes I am
[11:56:25] <seion> I just can't get it to go back to the original height after changing tabs on the accordion
[11:59:02] <ribot> suppose i want a custom element such as ('#e').custom = 'hi'; how to do this?
[12:00:53] <ribot> custom attribute*
[12:01:07] <jrockjiggz> $('#e').attr('param','value)
[12:01:21] <LeoJweda> hi, i have a design decision to make
[12:01:41] <ribot> is it legal to just do what i wrote?
[12:01:47] <jrockjiggz> no
[12:01:47] <LeoJweda> so the app i'm working on has a form that sends requests to the server and renders a graph
[12:02:23] <LeoJweda> in addition to requests to generate a graph it makes requests to filter each control when other controls are changed, i.e., staff members based on location
[12:02:34] <LeoJweda> what's the best way to go about doing that?
[12:02:50] <jrockjiggz> LeoJweda: send all the data at once?
[12:04:24] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: right, i'm thinking of having a function that sends the request and handles the returned data with an action parameter which can be either "generateReport" or for example "locationChanged".
[12:05:42] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: is there a better way?
[12:06:34] <jrockjiggz> your request returns all data based on parameters, you would replace the data on your page with the new data.  ?
[12:09:38] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: yes, that's what the server side code does at the moment (it wasn't designed by me). I'm just wondering if there's a better way to handle the client-side code, better than one function that handles all the actions.
[12:11:58] <dmsuperman> If I'm in an event handler would it be possible for me to somehow...pause the event propogation? I want to take the submit handler, intercept it, perform an AJAX request, check the response of that request, and on response finish the submit event
[12:13:32] <jrockjiggz> LeoJweda: well sounds like if it becomes a more complicated app, breaking up tasks sounds like something that might make it easier to manage.. sometimes having tasks broken into functions lets you read how it works much easier
[12:14:20] <jrockjiggz> dmsuperman: do an ajax request first, and put the submit into the success callback
[12:14:41] <LeoJweda> jrockjiggz: i'm aware of that but at the moment i just need to get the new front-end written. (typical "this is temporary" moment)
[12:15:00] <dmsuperman> jrockjiggz: I'm working with a form that other people are programmatically calling the submit handler on so I want to maintain compatibility
[12:15:13] <dmsuperman> But I'll just do it by calling the submit handler from within itself with a flag
[12:15:30] <jarr0dsz> jrockjiggz: took some time but here the results : http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/23/ fairly cool :D
[12:15:42] <jarr0dsz> only the image preloader isent positioned correctly but its for the idea ;)
[12:16:04] <pjeide> jrockjiggz, thanks. jsfiddle certainly helps to figure out that the code is at least correct. For some reason, the platform that I am running it in, doesn't echo the console.log from within the map()
[12:16:17] <pjeide> So I will have to address it there
[12:16:26] <jrockjiggz> dmsuperman: then $('form').submit( function(){ //do some ajax, with async set to false, if(everything good){ return true }else{ return false}
[12:16:33] <jrockjiggz> });
[12:17:28] <__p__> i still have teribbly problem with datatables
[12:19:02] <dmsuperman> jrockjiggz: yeah but non-async ajax is terrible :P
[12:19:09] <dmsuperman> no sense locking up the browser
[12:19:14] <jrockjiggz> yea it will lock up :(
[12:19:35] <jrockjiggz> well, that is what your asking though, to delay the submit until ajax is complete
[12:19:49] <__p__> orginal   http://s10.postimage.org/w26todhns/Screenshot_at_2012_02_28_19_10_56.jpg
[12:19:58] <__p__> after update http://s8.postimage.org/kmgj84hf8/Screenshot_at_2012_02_28_19_05_46.jpg
[12:20:39] <__p__> table header is increase height automatically :S
[12:21:27] <dmsuperman> jrockjiggz: right the submit, but I don't want to lock up the browser until so
[12:21:32] <dmsuperman> I want them to still be able to scroll and what not
[12:21:49] <mordof> __p__: it looks like it's applying the entire table's height to the header
[12:22:08] <mordof> __p__: I would wager that you've got something set up wrong and it's setting the height to the wrong place because of it
[12:22:16] <pjeide> jrockjiggz, turns out the platform that I am encompassing the code within uses jquery 1.4.2 :(
[12:22:20] <pjeide> so I have to map() differently ;)
[12:22:22] <mordof> __p__: check your element references that set up the table (i have no idea how it works, just a guess)
[12:22:39] <__p__> its datatables plugin
[12:22:50] <__p__> and i check maybe 99 times
[12:22:53] <mordof> __p__: that means nothing to me, i've never used it
[12:23:11] <__p__> they are  diffrent  int diffrent block ,
[12:23:26] <jrockjiggz> dmsuperman: checkAjax function(){ return $.ajax({ // }); });
[12:23:31] <mordof> __p__: i'm just speculating that the height of the header looks to match the height of the overall table. so a selector somewhere is likely wrong
[12:29:29] <seion> anyone know how to fix my accordion. It loads the correct height on startup but after I switch tabs on it and go back to the one thats having height issue it doesn expand high enough for the content inside.
[12:34:09] <ribot> i have a $(this).blur(function()... that i want to happen also on $(this).focus... can i do this without having to copy the code of the whole function?
[12:34:50] <JonathanNeal> It has been too long since I came in here to say hi.
[12:34:52] <JonathanNeal> What's new?
[12:34:52] <dabear> ribot: $(this).bind("blur focus", function(){})
[12:35:21] <dabear> JonathanNeal: nothing:)
[12:35:24] <ribot> dabear: thanks
[12:35:39] <JonathanNeal> dabear: i noticed the other day that jquery routes almost every event handler to "on" now.
[12:35:41] <dabear> JonathanNeal: except you're more awsome than last time
[12:35:50] <dabear> JonathanNeal: yep i know
[12:35:56] <dabear> don't like it, don't use it
[12:36:36] <JonathanNeal> because of the name or the arityÂ or what?
[12:36:45] <dabear> ugly syntax
[12:37:00] <dabear> I have to look up the syntax when using it
[12:37:31] <JonathanNeal> do you like functions that use a single object as the argument?
[12:37:57] <dabear> I have no problem with that no
[12:38:32] <dabear> this is a matter of preference anyway, so not gonna change my mind all :)
[12:38:41] <JonathanNeal> That doesn't sound like an endorsement either.
[12:39:10] <JonathanNeal> I was wondering if you didn't like the jQuery syntax because it had so many arguments that weren't entirely clear to you.
[12:39:49] <JonathanNeal> As opposed to, say, $.ajax using a settings object.
[12:40:13] <dabear> its just .on I have a problem with
[12:40:53] <JonathanNeal> oh the name?
[12:41:42] <ribot> dabear: how to know now if it's a blur or focus that triggered it?
[12:41:57] <dabear> yeah, and those apis with optional arguments
[12:42:20] <dabear> basically .on( events [, selector] [, data] ,
[12:42:22] <dabear> bha
[12:42:45] <dabear> ribot: this.type?
[12:44:59] <JonathanNeal> dabear: that's why i like object arguments because they're verbose and explain themselves, even if they take up more room.
[12:45:36] <dabear> yep
[12:46:20] <JonathanNeal> dabear: fork jquery and make everything use objects, problem solved.
[12:46:38] <JonathanNeal> then make it accept objects or strings, then pull request :)
[12:46:40] <dabear> I wish js had a shorthand for expressing parameters using a hash and calling a function, kinda like myFunc{foo:"bar"}
[12:46:40] <JonathanNeal> Problem. Solved.
[12:47:01] <dabear> would be the same as myFunc({foo: "bar"})
[12:47:12] <JonathanNeal> dabear: isn't that like ... myFunc({foo:"bar"}) ?
[12:47:26] <JonathanNeal> yea.
[12:49:21] <dabear> oh, and function foo:bar()
[12:49:38] <dabear> would be the same as foo.prototype.bar
[12:49:51] <dabear> = function(){}
[12:49:54] <JonathanNeal> it would be or it is?
[12:49:57] <dabear> man I miss lua
[12:50:08] <JonathanNeal> dabear: i know, javascript doesn't do it all, yet.
[12:58:54] <gnarf> ribot: event.type -- event being the first argument to the handler function
[12:59:11] <FrameFever> can i append a new div, to a newly created div in jquery?
[12:59:19] <FrameFever> it seems to be not
[12:59:43] <gnarf> FrameFever: of course
[12:59:46] <gnarf> ?demo
[12:59:47] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:59:59] <LeoJweda> thanks jrockjiggz
[13:00:01] <LeoJweda> later!
[13:00:01] <FrameFever> damn
[13:00:06] <jarr0dsz> would it be possible - somehow - with jquery if you toggle a class
[13:00:13] <gnarf> ?toggleClass @jarr0dsz
[13:00:13] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[13:00:21] <jarr0dsz> to move that complete div in another one or position it elsewhere?
[13:00:22] <ribot> gnarf: thanks
[13:00:35] <jarr0dsz> i have some boxes that toggle worked on it tonight works great
[13:00:43] <jarr0dsz> only when they expand i would like to position them elsewhere
[13:01:00] <gnarf> jarr0dsz: use css to define the new positioning and toggleClass?
[13:01:08] <jarr0dsz> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/A9rKm/24/ like that ;) i think its pretty cool for my first real build something in jquery attempt
[13:01:09] <gnarf> if you have ui effects core it adds animated toggleClass
[13:01:36] <jarr0dsz> i want to have for example the first box and the 2nd and 3rd always be positioned below, so if i expand the 1st block
[13:01:46] <jarr0dsz> i should see 2 closed blocks ( 2,3) and 1 should be expanded below them
[13:01:50] <jarr0dsz> or perhaps better above
[13:01:59] <jarr0dsz> any idea how i could do that?
[13:02:10] <jarr0dsz> perhaps add some sort of positioning css with the expand classes
[13:03:07] <jarr0dsz> something like on http://stackoverflow.com/a/220335/355281
[13:03:19] <gnarf> dabear: .on( events, selector, handler ) or .on({ "eventNames": handler }, selector);
[13:03:26] <gnarf> its really a much cleaner syntax than .bind
[13:03:36] <gnarf> or rather .bind/.delegate
[13:03:40] <dabear> ok
[13:03:53] <dabear> not agreing
[13:04:14] <gnarf> a) its basically the same syntax as .bind()
[13:04:21] <rroelofs> jarr0dsz: It sounds like you want an accordion.  Check out the jquery ui web site
[13:04:24] <dabear> I like bind
[13:04:26] <gnarf> just adds "selector"
[13:04:27] <dabear> bind is pretty
[13:04:38] <jarr0dsz> rroelofs: yes and i made my own fully with only features i want works great
[13:04:44] <jarr0dsz> only problem now is the positioning
[13:04:59] <jarr0dsz> make the div with each block positioning before the others when expanding
[13:05:00] <dabear> on is more of a hooker
[13:05:31] <dabear> oh and not trolling here, just my opinion
[13:05:50] <gnarf> dabear: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L956-978
[13:06:01] <gnarf> its literally the same, except it adds a selector argument
[13:06:09] <gnarf> and its 2 characters shorter to type
[13:06:12] <gnarf> :)
[13:07:39] <gnarf> dabear: so not sure why you think bind > on -- unless its just a naming thing
[13:08:21] <gnarf> personally - on/off make more sense something on click handler
[13:09:28] <gnarf> or rather: "something on click" -> something.on( "click", handler );
[13:10:18] <gnarf> "click on a td in something" -> something.on( "click", "td", handler );
[13:11:52] <gnarf> it's okay - .on() doesn't like you either
[13:11:53] <gnarf> ;)
[13:16:41] <warrenparsons> Wow
[13:17:55] <SoulRaven> anyone try to put images on select box
[13:19:38] <SoulRaven> anyone try to put images on select box
[13:21:23] <JackBauer24> SoulRaven: I use MSDropDown jquery plugin for this
[13:23:31] <SoulRaven> JackBauer24: and is working if i want to put only images and no text?
[13:23:52] <JackBauer24> SoulRaven: yes, it does it's job well
[13:23:59] <JackBauer24> I use it for theme selecting
[13:25:12] <JackBauer24> SoulRaven: http://www.marghoobsuleman.com/jquery-image-dropdown
[13:25:47] <SoulRaven> thx, i have finded, now i am reading about that
[13:25:48] <SoulRaven> :)
[13:27:56] <Haraldson> when using namespaced events, I would overwrite an existing 'click.foo' when binding 'click.foo' a second time, right?
[13:28:31] <Haraldson> as opposed to 'click' itself, which would just add another click handler, but not touching the existing one?
[13:28:52] <Haraldson> *touch
[13:30:27] <warrenparsons> Haraldson: That sounds right.
[13:30:57] <Haraldson> allright, warrenparsons :)
[13:31:10] <Haraldson> then my suggestion for Malsup (cycle) wasn't all that bad
[13:31:28] <Haraldson> struggled a long time with my nav buttons looking for old slides
[13:31:57] <Haraldson> had to unbind the buttons, and let cycle rebind, so that the only un-namespaced click event was the most recent one
[13:32:06] <Haraldson> else it would look for a parent that would no longer exist
[13:32:12] <Haraldson> tired...
[13:32:19] <warrenparsons> Haraldson: Just checked. It doesn't overwrite. Adds to.
[13:32:21] <warrenparsons> http://jsfiddle.net/5WbF3/
[13:32:26] <Haraldson> hum :/
[13:32:31] <warrenparsons> You would need to explicitly unbind click.foo
[13:33:22] <warrenparsons> Haraldson: http://jsfiddle.net/5WbF3/1/
[13:33:25] <Haraldson> ok, then he would need to do some kind of cleanup of "coming" events upon cycle init
[13:33:27] <warrenparsons> That one has the unbinding.
[13:33:35] <warrenparsons> Haraldson: Yep
[13:33:50] <Haraldson> thanks for the effort :)
[13:33:55] <warrenparsons> Haraldson: Sure thing.
[13:33:56] <poppiez> I've been trying to get the css 'position' value on the iphone for hours now. it just doesn't work. myElem.css('position') is undefined while on the desktop it's absolute. why is that?
[13:35:52] <RandalSchwartz> events.  sigh
[13:36:02] <RandalSchwartz> I have two events for "on submit" added by two different plugins
[13:36:08] <Haraldson> hehe
[13:36:10] <RandalSchwartz> they're now fighting each other.
[13:36:21] <RandalSchwartz> is there any way to force a particular order?
[13:36:51] <Haraldson> â¦ are they namespaced?
[13:36:53] <Haraldson> any of them?
[13:36:59] <RandalSchwartz> not yet
[13:37:05] <RandalSchwartz> I wrote teh first one before namespaces
[13:37:08] <RandalSchwartz> I guess I could add that
[13:37:25] <RandalSchwartz> I still don't know how to make them sequenced even if I do that though
[13:37:45] <Haraldson> then why don't you deactivate the namespaced one and run it after the other, in a callback for instance?
[13:38:22] <Haraldson> http://api.jquery.com/off/    'eventType.name'
[13:39:05] <RandalSchwartz> well - that will still depend on who gets defined first, now?
[13:39:25] <RandalSchwartz> I have one that's in a common include for every page
[13:39:30] <RandalSchwartz> I have another that is specific to this page
[13:39:40] <ribot> thanks all of ya!
[13:39:59] <RandalSchwartz> the common one is a validator... if form values have been added, you can't go away from the page.
[13:40:05] <Haraldson> RandalSchwartz: the unnamed one would run anyway, since it's unnamed and you can't cancel only the one
[13:40:12] <Haraldson> the other one, you can stop because it's named
[13:41:30] <Haraldson> not sure how you would go about it, if you can mix a reference from the page-specific plugin into the sitewide etc
[13:41:49] <Haraldson> but if you could, you could .on() it again, then trigger('submit.name')
[13:42:30] <gnarf> RandalSchwartz: the first event bound is called first
[13:42:33] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, I'm still confused because I'm at a couple of different levels of abstraction
[13:42:43] <RandalSchwartz> gnarf - that's what I'm suspecting.
[13:42:53] <RandalSchwartz> I might have to redesign this section, and it was already working well. :)
[13:42:54] <gnarf> unless they are bound via delegation
[13:43:13] <RandalSchwartz> delegation = namespaces?
[13:43:29] <Haraldson> delegation = "live", now on
[13:43:33] <RandalSchwartz> ahh right
[13:43:50] <gnarf> delegation = binding to a higher level element and catching the event as it bubbles up
[13:44:27] <seion> Accordion when page loads -> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/9/afterau.jpg/  Accordion after I click tab below one opened and then click back into same tab -> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/846/befored.jpg/   anyone have any ideas how to fix
[13:44:40] <RandalSchwartz> part of the problem is that I need to retrigger the event with a direct button push
[13:45:08] <RandalSchwartz> Hmm.  maybe not
[13:45:35] <RandalSchwartz> if I continue to propogate the button push event, will it eventually look like a submit event?
[13:45:41] <RandalSchwartz> because then I can trap it there.
[13:45:52] <styol> I'm not entirely sure how to explain this issue/question/goal appropriately, but basically an each() is being ran on document ready and new content is later coming in via ajax that isn't being touched by this each (naturally). There is nothing like live('each') or something along those lines, correct? I just need to do the each again when the new content comes in?
[13:45:55] <Haraldson> well, if it's named you could then do $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit.pluginname');
[13:46:20] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, I'm thinking I have to read up more on namespaceds
[13:46:33] <Haraldson> :)
[13:46:47] <RandalSchwartz> are there some good tutorials past the reference stuff?
[13:47:01] <Haraldson> There's really not much to it
[13:47:03] <ravenzz> ?newcontent @ styol
[13:47:03] <bot-t> styol, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[13:47:14] <Haraldson> you just add the dot and your name, when binding or unbinding
[13:47:35] <Haraldson> you can even call 'click.namespace1.namespace2'
[13:48:33] <Haraldson> on that note I'm going to end my 13-hours long day
[13:50:45] <styol> ravenzz: thanks, that's look pretty promising but one problem might be I can't touch the Ajax part of the code unfortunately
[13:51:20] <ravenzz> you don't have to touch it
[13:51:50] <styol> ravenzz: I might be misreading.. thanks I'll give it a whirl. also thanks again gnarf :)
[13:52:52] <ravenzz> yeah that's useful jQuery should somehow provide a such feature
[13:53:45] <Haraldson> the thing I've wanted lately is an append callback
[13:54:04] <RandalSchwartz> so $('form').on('submit.mypluginname', function ... )
[13:54:15] <RandalSchwartz> that will be like 'submit', but I can clear it ...?
[13:54:41] <RandalSchwartz> and will $('form').off('submit.mypluginname') bust anything if it wasn't set?
[13:55:01] <peol> No, it will "fail" silently
[13:55:05] <RandalSchwartz> nice
[13:55:32] <RandalSchwartz> ok - so I tell my mainpage to always kill the plugin, even though 90% of my pages won't have that plugin
[14:02:59] <sphinxxx> if i have a faq.html page, but i load it in to a div on index.html  using ajax, does faq.html still get indexed by search engines?
[14:03:48] <ravenzz> yes if there is a link in index.html
[14:04:15] <ravenzz> the crawler can follow :)
[14:05:04] <WebDragon> heya folkz
[14:06:38] <WebDragon> on http://360.client-proof.com/home.php I'm using the jquery.multiple-bgs.js from http://www.chicowebdesign.com/blog/2010/10/21/updated-jquery-multiple-background-plug-in/
[14:07:04] <sphinxxx> ok great
[14:07:07] <WebDragon> however it doesn't appear to work in IE9 when you change to IE8 mode -- so the boss is thinking that it just doesn't work
[14:08:02] <WebDragon> does anyone around here have an actual IE 6-8 that can tell me whether this thing really works for earlier IE's (I'm referring to the #Footer with the paper-tear, tiled bg, and transparent png at the bottom
[14:08:24] <astropirate> WebDragon, http://browserling.com/
[14:09:20] <WebDragon> heh nifty, hadn't seen that one before
[14:09:27] <WebDragon> thanks astropirate
[14:10:28] <jrockjiggz> also: http://browsershots.org/
[14:12:57] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone tell me what can be wrong when i have $('#main').live('pageinit',function(event){	console.log("Activated!");
[14:13:03] <Wiz_KeeD> that runs every time i refresh and submit a form
[14:13:11] <Wiz_KeeD> but when i submit a form once and i still get that message
[14:13:26] <Wiz_KeeD> the $('#login').click(function(){ stops working all of the sudden
[14:13:31] <Wiz_KeeD> even if it is in that block
[14:15:22] <Wiz_KeeD> does anyone have any ideea on that?
[14:15:44] <Zzaichik> using an older version of jQuery?
[14:16:27] <ProLoser|Work> is there a way to do object comparison with jquery?
[14:18:09] <Wiz_KeeD> Zzaichik, no way other sections work just fine
[14:18:14] <Wiz_KeeD> and i'm using jquerymobile
[14:18:21] <Wiz_KeeD> even console.log($('#login).val())
[14:18:22] <Wiz_KeeD> works
[14:18:33] <Wiz_KeeD> 	$('#login').click(function(){ somehow just doesn't fire
[14:19:29] <Zzaichik> if you're using the lastest version of jQuery, .live() isn't what you want to use.
[14:19:42] <nobitanobi1> I have a checkbox in a row and I want to change the style of that row when the checkbox is clicked. I know how to use the "click" handler, but how can I know if that input is "checked" or not to apply the correspondent styles?
[14:19:50] <Zzaichik> ?.on() @Wiz_KeeD
[14:19:51] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:20:00] <Wiz_KeeD> but that fires with no problem
[14:20:02] <Zzaichik> ?.delegate @Wiz_KeeD
[14:20:02] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:20:19] <Wiz_KeeD> the code fires just before $('#login').click(function(){
[14:20:41] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: I'm not saying that it's necessarily the problem.. it could be but I don't know. You just shouldn't be using it because it's been deprecated.
[14:21:17] <Wiz_KeeD> right, well thanks for the advice :D
[14:21:33] <Zzaichik> It's very hard to troubleshoot code without seeing it. Can you create a working demo?  In jsfiddle.net or something?
[14:22:39] <Wiz_KeeD> i am so confused with this problem
[14:22:42] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm
[14:22:53] <Wiz_KeeD> pretty hard since it's a form submission and then the problem
[14:23:13] <Zzaichik> yeah
[14:24:48] <Wiz_KeeD> wish i could help in one way or another
[14:26:05] <ravenzz> how many #login do you have :p?
[14:27:22] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to query an wonder which is a common/nice way to solve this: i have x li elements in an i have to add a "active" class to the nth-child(x) but also remove the active class from the other li elements. maybe someone has a hint for me! thx in advance
[14:28:16] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm
[14:28:19] <Wiz_KeeD> supposingly just one
[14:28:28] <peol> $('li').removeClass('active').eq(x).addClass('active')
[14:28:43] <peol> or...
[14:29:13] <peol> $('li:eq(x)').addClass('active').siblings().removeClass('active')
[14:29:31] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: What you posted looks pretty straight forward.. and should be workingâ¦.
[14:29:49] <Zzaichik> you could try doing something like $('#login').on(''click', '#login', function() {â¦}); I don't know what the point would be in this situation but, you could try it. See if that makes it work (for testing/troubleshooting).
[14:29:51] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jsfiddle.net/qjWCa/
[14:29:54] <Wiz_KeeD> something like this but...
[14:30:11] <Wiz_KeeD> allrighty sir, one sec
[14:31:32] <Wiz_KeeD> doesn't even fire the first time Zzaichik
[14:32:05] <NickASloan> I have three select boxes. I was hoping to select all options other than the first child of each select box
[14:32:27] <NickASloan> Is that doable without a .each()?
[14:33:09] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: need to load jQuery
[14:33:10] <nobitanobi> What am I doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/jWCxm/ Why is not adding the class?
[14:33:10] <mightym> peol: thx a lot, ill try :)
[14:33:33] <ravenzz> NickASloan $('select option:not(:first)')
[14:34:51] <NickASloan> ravenzz: as soon as I finished typing that out, I realized that :not is what I was missing
[14:35:00] <NickASloan> but thank you very much
[14:35:25] <ravenzz>  yeah np, you're welcome
[14:37:12] <Wiz_KeeD> so i have noway around this crap
[14:37:41] <Zzaichik> Why does that click event need to be in that funciton?
[14:37:45] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/qjWCa/2/
[14:38:41] <Wiz_KeeD> so it attaches it when the element is in the DOM?
[14:39:35] <Wiz_KeeD> outside it doesn't work
[14:45:52] <shwaiil> hi
[14:46:35] <shwaiil> Q: Let's say I have a element of type <select> if I do el.on('click', fn(){ ... } ), whats the fastest way to get the selected option value  ? TKs
[14:47:09] <jrockjiggz> $('select').val()
[14:47:16] <shwaiil> jrockjiggz: thanks :)
[14:47:44] <shwaiil> jrockjiggz: I changed to event "change" and done $( this ).val()
[14:51:48] <LeoJweda> hi, i'm not very comfortable with the .post() callback function. the server returns XML data but each part is going to be sued to populate a different control. which parameter should i use? data, textStatus, or jqXHR?
[14:56:26] <Wiz_KeeD> it's hapening again!
[14:56:32] <Wiz_KeeD> on a larger scale now
[14:56:42] <LeoJweda> Wiz_KeeD: what is?
[14:57:00] <Wiz_KeeD> right after i submit a form, the client side verification fails completly
[14:57:11] <Wiz_KeeD> i have this page right? i have many form validations
[14:57:22] <Wiz_KeeD> they all work until i submit the data once and return at the same page
[14:57:34] <Wiz_KeeD> then all the form validation becomes null
[14:57:35] <shwaiil> Q: I've got one <container> that have N childs, with nested childs and so on. I have on <select name="foo"> that I get its option value. I want to place this val inside a <textarea> that is in the same level as <select> and not in the childs. I'm wondering if there's a way to do this ? I remember methods like .next() etc
[14:57:39] <LeoJweda> Wiz_KeeD: sorry, i'm a relative-noob, i probably won't be able to help you.
[14:57:42] <shwaiil> I need something like it, so I can abstract
[14:57:46] <Wiz_KeeD> :(
[14:58:22] <shwaiil> I dont want to be very specific for this solution, just having the <select> and finding the nearest <textarea> would be cool
[14:58:50] <Wiz_KeeD> what the hell is goin on
[14:58:59] <shwaiil> found .closest() nice :)
[15:01:01] <Zzaichik> ?.live
[15:01:01] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:02:00] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use http://api.jquery.com/on/ to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use http://api.jquery.com/delegate/ in preference to .live().
[15:02:39] <Wiz_KeeD> it worked before i doubt it's because of that since the condition enters but...as you wish
[15:03:12] <Zzaichik> haha - I'm just thinking eliminate any possibilities.
[15:04:32] <Guest38636> hi
[15:04:45] <Guest38636> hi guys
[15:06:22] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD:  it's not getting passed this line;  $('#main').load('pageinit',Â function(event)Â {
[15:06:32] <Zzaichik> is pageinit a classname? ID?
[15:06:39] <Wiz_KeeD> it is getting passed that
[15:06:40] <Wiz_KeeD> trust me
[15:06:53] <Zzaichik> okay - in jsfiddle it isnt
[15:07:03] <Wiz_KeeD> that's different
[15:07:04] <Zzaichik> because that console.log(Activated)  never shows up
[15:07:12] <Zzaichik> but nevermind
[15:07:13] <Zzaichik> :)
[15:07:24] <Wiz_KeeD> it does show in my local example
[15:07:37] <Zzaichik> what is 'pageinit' then?
[15:07:48] <Wiz_KeeD> even
[15:07:48] <Wiz_KeeD> t
[15:08:02] <nFFF> is it? :<<
[15:09:10] <nFFF> maybe if we are using our sexy mobiles
[15:09:22] <nFFF> bind to (window)
[15:09:24] <Zzaichik> ^ sexy
[15:09:31] <Wiz_KeeD> uh?
[15:09:47] <Zzaichik> My first thought was that pageinit needed a period or hash at the beginning
[15:09:55] <Zzaichik> And if it's an event, than no quotes.
[15:09:56] <nFFF> pageinit better by a variable for a URL
[15:10:02] <nFFF> is all im saying
[15:10:03] <Zzaichik> no that's a lie
[15:10:23] <nFFF> ?load
[15:10:23] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[15:10:34] <nFFF> ?load(url, callback)
[15:10:36] <bot-t> nFFF, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[15:10:55] <nFFF> shiiiiiiit
[15:11:13] <nFFF> Wiz_KeeD, your code is fuxored homie
[15:11:20] <Wiz_KeeD> DAIUM
[15:11:25] <Wiz_KeeD> s'like dat?
[15:11:34] <Wiz_KeeD> help a brother out
[15:11:54] <donCams> brotha
[15:11:59] <nFFF> rm -rf
[15:12:03] <nFFF> is the only solution
[15:12:04] <nFFF> :<<
[15:12:15] <Wiz_KeeD> har har
[15:12:21] <nFFF> basically you need to figure out what your trying to do
[15:12:21] <donCams> nFFF: you're deleting everything... :<
[15:12:31] <gnarf> ravenzz - styol was right btws
[15:12:42] <gnarf> its meant to be called after the append
[15:12:47] <gnarf> its not automagic
[15:12:49] <nFFF> $('#main').load('pageinit',Â function(event)Â { //  what is this meant to do, what do you want to achieve/
[15:13:08] <Zzaichik> ^ That's where the problem lies.
[15:13:10] <Zzaichik> That line.
[15:13:15] <Wiz_KeeD> that is how jquerymobile suggest you should use instead of document.ready
[15:13:20] <nFFF> your confusing the use of load, mixing both uses, and doing it wrong either way
[15:13:23] <nFFF> yea
[15:13:24] <Wiz_KeeD> this is because the loading of other pages is done by ajax
[15:13:28] <nFFF> for mobiles
[15:13:34] <Wiz_KeeD> indeed
[15:13:45] <nFFF> and its not used like that
[15:13:46] <Wiz_KeeD> is that wrong?
[15:13:50] <styol> gnarf: ah ok, still awesome tho. I ended up realizing that I had control over the element being loaded via AJAX and that I could just wrap it with the div that the each was otherwise doing, so kind of side stepped the original issue.
[15:13:54] <Wiz_KeeD> where have i gone wrong...
[15:14:02] <nFFF> $('#main').on('pageinit', function(){});
[15:14:14] <Wiz_KeeD> allrighty sir
[15:14:16] <Wiz_KeeD> will try
[15:14:24] <nFFF> ?on()
[15:14:25] <bot-t> nFFF, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:14:44] <nFFF> you have used ?load()
[15:14:46] <Wiz_KeeD> i have told you that the function fires every time
[15:15:04] <Wiz_KeeD> it's just that the .click event doesn't stick
[15:15:05] <Zzaichik> no he used .live
[15:15:22] <nFFF> So you decided to change it to an ajx function? :>
[15:15:35] <nFFF> and you think thats going to solve the issue ?
[15:15:35] <Wiz_KeeD> $('#main').on('pageinit',function(event){ doesn't even fire
[15:15:43] <Wiz_KeeD> wtf?
[15:16:02] <sparuvu> can someone help me to resolve the issue in this fiddleâ¦..http://jsfiddle.net/A4XaV/12/
[15:16:10] <Zzaichik> I don't know if it should have been firing in the first place man
[15:16:17] <sparuvu> I am not able to submit the form if I click on the submit span
[15:16:24] <Fidelix> Can someone help me with this really nooby problem? http://pastebin.com/UytmkFmf
[15:16:28] <sparuvu> but works if I click on the submit button
[15:16:30] <JonathanNeal> forget your troubles! come on, get happy! do the best you can with what you've got.
[15:17:14] <nFFF> sparuvu, thars some generic event binding right therrre :Z
[15:17:58] <sparuvu> nFFF: can you be more specific ? I did not understand â¦ I am a bit new to jQuery
[15:17:58] <sparuvu> :(
[15:18:01] <Wiz_KeeD> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[15:18:17] <sparuvu> I tried the native method for submitting the form â¦.
[15:18:20] <nFFF> Wiz_KeeD, theres a specific channel for jquery mobile
[15:18:32] <nFFF> sparuvu, do you really want to bind this submit to each span on the page?
[15:18:37] <nFFF> Thats your first question
[15:18:40] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah i've been there nobody talks
[15:19:19] <nFFF> :>
[15:19:25] <sparuvu> nFFF: My goal is to submit the form without hitting the submit button
[15:19:57] <sparuvu> so I just tried  a span
[15:20:12] <sparuvu> it can be anchor/div/whatever
[15:21:30] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: what's the absolute path to your jquery_mobile.js file
[15:22:22] <Wiz_KeeD> uh?
[15:22:43] <Wiz_KeeD> it's php generated
[15:22:45] <Wiz_KeeD> ah nvm
[15:23:01] <NoReGreT> how can I loop http://pastebin.com/WrKaR11K using $.each() ? i'm confused
[15:24:54] <sparuvu> NoReGreT:  its very simpleâ¦$.each(data, function(index, value){
[15:24:54] <sparuvu> 	alert(data[index] === value);
[15:24:54] <sparuvu> });
[15:25:15] <torm3nt> avoid using .each, it's very slow

[15:25:52] <LeoJweda> i'll ask later
[15:26:10] <NoReGreT> torm3nt: what's faster ?
[15:26:25] <zduffy> I am trying to provide a text box that a user enters in a string of numbers and if it matches a record to automatically insert that data into the corresponding text boxes. I have the query right (as I can place a string in there and it auto populates) I assume I need to use $_GET on a form? Can anyone point me in the right direction here?
[15:26:26] <torm3nt> for...
[15:26:41] <torm3nt> it's more verbose, but you're not creating an anonymous function upon every iteration
[15:27:05] <Fidelix> Can someone help me with this really nooby problem? http://pastebin.com/UytmkFmf I'm not sure how to reference "CodeMirror" from within itself
[15:27:11] <sparuvu> nFFF: its not working :(
[15:27:16] <sparuvu> its not submitting the data
[15:27:28] <torm3nt> or, if you use something like underscore.js, you get a nice utility looping method that will utilise native looping implementations if it's available, else it'll use a method similar to jQuery's each method
[15:27:49] <nFFF> sparuvu, what makes you think that?
[15:27:57] <RandalSchwartz> solved my problem from earlier by the way
[15:28:00] <sparuvu> nFFF: try hitting the submit button you will see a confirmation of the submission
[15:28:10] <sparuvu> even my google doc is not being updated
[15:28:12] <RandalSchwartz> I just remove all other submit handlers when I'm sure I want to be the boss.
[15:28:22] <RandalSchwartz> now I have a question about .dialog
[15:29:50] <RandalSchwartz> not sure how to change the default button... is it just a matter of ordering the buttons?
[15:30:45] <NoReGreT> sparuvu: still lost, how can I get to the values of user_id and others ?
[15:31:31] <sparuvu> nFFF: did you check that ?
[15:31:46] <sparuvu> NoReGreT: try value.News.user_id
[15:32:05] <nFFF> sec
[15:32:07] <RandalSchwartz> I guess it's the first button is always the default.
[15:32:12] <RandalSchwartz> so I just swapped my buttons. :)

[15:34:46] <donCams> coldhead: i like that quote
[15:34:58] <sparuvu> nFFF: FYI
[15:35:18] <sparuvu> the modified fiddle you sent me is throwing an error as well:(
[15:35:30] <NoReGreT> sparuvu: "value.News is undefined"
[15:36:21] <Wiz_KeeD> the wierd thing is that if i use the selector for th element and console.log the val() it comes up
[15:36:29] <Wiz_KeeD> yet the click event doesn't bind to it
[15:36:42] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/A4XaV/15/
[15:36:53] <nFFF> @ sparuvu
[15:43:52] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: I wish I could be more helpful. as far as the click even is concerned, this is the best that I can offer. Maybe that event is just getting lost in everything else you're doing. http://jsfiddle.net/qjWCa/9/
[15:44:05] <sparuvu> NoReGreT: http://jsfiddle.net/gAMVJ/1/ there you go
[15:44:12] <Wiz_KeeD> i apreciate the hard effort though Zzaichik
[15:44:13] <Wiz_KeeD> much apreach
[15:44:25] <Wiz_KeeD> where is it getting lost, how?
[15:44:40] <Zzaichik> I couldn't say
[15:44:43] <nFFF> sparuvu, does it work hwo you want now?
[15:45:14] <sparuvu> nFFF: nope its not working
[15:45:15] <sparuvu> :(
[15:46:01] <Wiz_KeeD> hmmm
[15:46:09] <Wiz_KeeD> i was just about to do that myself
[15:46:20] <sparuvu> when I fill the fields and clicking on span.submitâ¦.. its saying  "fields are empty " and the refrshing the page
[15:46:21] <Wiz_KeeD> the form.submit always fires
[15:47:01] <Wiz_KeeD> this is so weird
[15:47:01] <sparuvu> the second time you see the submit button [the default one] which I dont want to use
[15:47:13] <sparuvu> Wiz_KeeD: are you looking my issue ?
[15:47:18] <Zzaichik> yeah, the default action of the input type="submit" will always fire
[15:47:22] <Wiz_KeeD> sparuvu, sorry no
[15:47:32] <Wiz_KeeD> what the hell happened to click...
[15:47:37] <sparuvu> oh okayâ¦ I am also having the similar issue
[15:47:39] <Wiz_KeeD> i have no problem in working with that
[15:47:47] <Wiz_KeeD> but it gives me the feeling os instability
[15:47:52] <Zzaichik> yeah
[15:47:53] <Wiz_KeeD> it previously worked...
[15:47:56] <nFFF> sparuvu, does it submit correctly with the normal button?
[15:47:59] <Wiz_KeeD> what the hell happened
[15:48:00] <sparuvu> yes
[15:48:07] <sparuvu> it submits normally
[15:48:14] <Zzaichik> that sucks the worst - when it worked and for whatever reason stopeed
[15:48:16] <Zzaichik> stopped*
[15:48:37] <gasull> Hi.  Can someone tell me why this $.getJSON call doesn't work? http://dpaste.com/709133/
[15:48:57] <Zzaichik> But like I said earlier, in jsfiddle, it's not even reaching the click event.
[15:49:30] <Fidelix> Can someone help me with this really nooby problem? http://pastebin.com/UytmkFmf How do I create a variable that's only available from within this .once function?
[15:49:32] <Zzaichik> It's not getting inside of the pageinit even
[15:49:38] <Zzaichik> event
[15:49:57] <nFFF> sparuvu, for me they are boh the same? :<
[15:50:01] <ngharo> ?g same origin policy @ gasull
[15:50:11] <bot-t> gasull, Same origin policy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[15:50:23] <shwaiil> Q: for textarea should we do .text() or .val() ?
[15:50:25] <shwaiil> tks
[15:50:37] <sparuvu> :-?
[15:50:41] <Wiz_KeeD> Zzaichik, that's right it is the worst
[15:50:46] <Wiz_KeeD> it works in the local example
[15:50:51] <Wiz_KeeD> though i see now that
[15:50:59] <Wiz_KeeD> bindning events as you tried
[15:51:00] <Wiz_KeeD> works
[15:51:05] <gasull> ngharo: oh, I see.  The JSON API for Google maps should be used with backend code, right?
[15:51:07] <sparuvu> nFFF: its working for me when I submit the form using the submit button
[15:51:09] <Wiz_KeeD> $('body').on('click','#login',function(){
[15:51:11] <Wiz_KeeD> this will work
[15:51:18] <Zzaichik> yeah that should work.
[15:51:20] <Wiz_KeeD> $('#login').click(function(){});
[15:51:22] <Wiz_KeeD> won't work
[15:51:26] <Wiz_KeeD> in God's name...WHY?!
[15:51:30] <ngharo> gasull: yeah, unless they have a JSONP service also
[15:51:31] <gasull> ngharo: not within JavaScript
[15:51:32] <Zzaichik> so that suggests that the DOM is being changed
[15:51:36] <LordThumper> Hello. I want to capture the user's mouse click, but only when he releases the button immediately, not when he clicks to select text for example
[15:51:41] <LordThumper> Is this possible?
[15:51:42] <gasull> ngharo: OK.  Thanks
[15:51:53] <Wiz_KeeD> the DOM does change Zzaichik, yet why this behaviour?
[15:52:05] <Zzaichik> And if the element isn't present when the DOM is ready / loaded. Your click event won't exist.
[15:52:30] <Zzaichik> Okay see now that I can answer. The click event it attached to elements in the DOM.
[15:52:53] <Zzaichik> If the DOM loads and the element changes or doesn't exist yet, then that event has nothing to attach to.
[15:53:00] <nFFF> sparuvu ok sorry i see now
[15:53:12] <Zzaichik> And will be skipped over.
[15:53:20] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah that's true but it's recalled on pageInit
[15:53:22] <Wiz_KeeD> and it should bind again
[15:53:27] <Wiz_KeeD> and i remember it working previously
[15:53:33] <Wiz_KeeD> before i made some other changes...i think
[15:53:39] <Wiz_KeeD> so why would this call be any different
[15:53:45] <Zzaichik> You'd think it would, but obviously the page refresh is killing it
[15:53:57] <sparuvu> nFFF: I have done this before many timesâ¦..
[15:53:59] <Wiz_KeeD> wait...
[15:54:02] <Wiz_KeeD> it's my bad
[15:54:04] <Zzaichik> the page refresh is resetting the DOM
[15:54:07] <Wiz_KeeD> i've binded click on body
[15:54:10] <Wiz_KeeD> that's why it works
[15:54:18] <Zzaichik> try binding to form
[15:54:23] <Wiz_KeeD> Zzaichik, so what's wrong with that
[15:55:08] <Zzaichik> Well, the event just gets lost. On page refresh, the connection between event and element is toasted.
[15:55:23] <Wiz_KeeD> and refresh should reload and rebind
[15:55:32] <Zzaichik> not necessarily.
[15:55:41] <Wiz_KeeD> yes it should :)
[15:55:41] <nFFF> sparuvu, well....
[15:55:46] <Zzaichik> Well it should.
[15:55:51] <nFFF> your first issue is you can't have an input named submit
[15:55:55] <Zzaichik> But it depends on how you're going about a page refresh
[15:56:10] <nFFF> and another element and try and submit the form pragmatically
[15:56:18] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to jquery and wonder if there  is a way to check when $(window).scroll ends? and i don't mean when the user scrolled to the bottom or top of the page. i mean when he stops scrolling
[15:56:24] <nFFF> so thats your first issue as to why it wasnt submiting
[15:56:27] <nFFF> now its submitting
[15:56:33] <nFFF> but the data isnt being passed
[15:56:35] <RandomCharacter> http://jsfiddle.net/A8XJ5/5/ what am i doing wrong? to display the error function
[15:56:37] <nFFF> specifically the text area
[15:57:11] <sparuvu> hmmmmmm
[15:58:03] <nobitanobi> ok, I love jQuery.
[15:58:14] <LakWork_> of course you dpo
[15:58:16] <Zzaichik> ^ yay!
[15:58:17] <LakWork_> do*
[15:58:20] <nobitanobi> >)
[15:58:51] <Zzaichik> RandomCharacter: more info por favor
[15:59:57] <sparuvu> nFFF: anymore insights about the issue ?
[16:00:00] <sparuvu> :(
[16:00:17] <RandomCharacter> http://jsfiddle.net/A8XJ5/5/ umm i dont have anymore info. The thing that i am trying to use is http://jsfiddle.net/A8XJ5/1/ but this code is working perfectly. But mine isnt
[16:01:13] <Zzaichik> RandomCharacter: First thing I noticed;  <body onload="onBodyLoad()"> is diff
[16:02:06] <RandomCharacter> http://jsfiddle.net/A8XJ5/6/ updated and still nothing :(
[16:02:19] <Zzaichik> Well, it has to do with the url then.
[16:02:45] <Wiz_KeeD> anyway
[16:02:49] <Wiz_KeeD> Zzaichik, man, you fixed it
[16:02:53] <Wiz_KeeD> calling the event through the form
[16:02:55] <Wiz_KeeD> fixed it
[16:03:02] <Wiz_KeeD> and i think i have an answer on why
[16:03:03] <Wiz_KeeD> :)
[16:03:17] <RandomCharacter> alright thakns anyways
[16:03:19] <Zzaichik> RandomCharacter:  datatype is diff too
[16:03:22] <Wiz_KeeD> every time a new page is loaded the dom is changed and the previous values remain
[16:03:27] <Zzaichik> jsonp, not json
[16:03:33] <RandomCharacter> hmm
[16:03:34] <Wiz_KeeD> calling them through the form calls on the actual active element
[16:03:59] <Wiz_KeeD> Thanks a lot for looking into my problem and taking so much time on it Zzaichik
[16:04:08] <Wiz_KeeD> it's a load of my chest and now it works great
[16:04:11] <Zzaichik> Wiz_KeeD: nice! good, good. Yeah calling through the form gives that event a constant element.
[16:04:13] <Wiz_KeeD> much apreciated man
[16:04:17] <Zzaichik> My pleasure!
[16:04:18] <Zzaichik> good lck
[16:04:21] <Zzaichik> luck*
[16:04:22] * Wiz_KeeD huggles
[16:04:25] <Wiz_KeeD> <3
[16:04:29] <Zzaichik> lol
[16:06:03] <mightym> thank you anyway!
[16:06:11] <Wiz_KeeD> now i'm wondering wether i didn't notice this before since i wan't making extensive tests
[16:06:20] <Wiz_KeeD> and i didn't notice the js doesn't work after the form has been submited once
[16:06:24] <Wiz_KeeD> or was it something else...
[16:06:55] <Wiz_KeeD> doesn't that mean it shoudl also work with $('form #login').click(function(){}); ?
[16:08:03] <Wiz_KeeD> yes it does
[16:08:04] <Wiz_KeeD> work
[16:08:55] <nFFF> sparuvu
[16:08:56] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/A4XaV/17/
[16:08:59] <nFFF> this works
[16:12:09] <Wiz_KeeD> something is still on my mind Zzaichik
[16:12:27] <Wiz_KeeD> if the previous content is still stored messing with the current dom
[16:12:38] <cloke> is there a way to observe for events on a child iframe?
[16:12:53] <Wiz_KeeD> the previous content still is in a form
[16:13:03] <sparuvu> nFFF:  awesome...
[16:13:05] <sparuvu> it works
[16:13:06] <sparuvu> :)
[16:13:11] <sparuvu> thank you
[16:13:11] <nFFF> :>
[16:16:36] <KWhat4> anyone know why the hell the buttons for jquery UI are huge? https://jquery-ux-forms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/button.html
[16:16:58] <someprimetime> any reason why extend() wouldn't be working? $.extend(true, {}, files) where files is my object?
[16:17:39] <LordThumper> Is it possible to differentiate between a mouse click and a mouse click and drag event?
[16:17:46] <eddiemonge> KWhat4: becaise they are defined as that size?
[16:17:55] <eddiemonge> ?extend
[16:17:55] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[16:18:35] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: not enough info
[16:19:14] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: have you looked at event.type?
[16:19:16] <donCams> someprimetime: that should work. any error message?
[16:19:42] <KWhat4> eddiemonge: if you took 30 seconds to look at the CSS file and follow the theme roller like you will see that it is obviously not defined to be like that
[16:20:17] <__p__> is jquery have a function for double values ?
[16:20:31] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: well basically i'm cloning the FileList object which is readonly each time there is a .change() in my input filelistâ¦ i take the event, get e.target.files and set it = `files`.. now basically i'm doing this to give the users the option to select files and remove files before they officially upload them as FileList is readonly. so i'm going $.extend(true, {}, files); which i'd expect to merge all existing clones of `files`
[16:20:58] <someprimetime> i'll post a jsfiddle
[16:21:56] <eddiemonge> KWhat4: it is defined like that. you have font-size set at 1.0em and padding set at ems too
[16:22:18] <eddiemonge> __p__: double values?
[16:22:43] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: you know the drill. code
[16:22:47] <LordThumper> eddiemonge: Ok let me try that
[16:23:22] <__p__> eddiemonge: yes
[16:24:01] <eddiemonge> __p__: that was a question. what do you mean by double values
[16:24:18] <eddiemonge> do you mean data type?
[16:24:24] <LordThumper> Click and drag is still firing the click event almost half of the time
[16:24:36] <KWhat4> eddiemonge: that does not explain why the buttons on the theme roller page apper correctly at about 1.0 em and the buttons on the example are about 2.4 em
[16:24:40] <__p__> yes value type is double
[16:25:29] <__p__> example money format, 4.56, 1E8.00, 1E99.25
[16:26:28] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: sorry, you need to look at mousedown and mouseup and compare stuff there
[16:27:09] <LordThumper> Ah check mouse coords?
[16:28:09] <eddiemonge> KWhat4: have you compared the css for both? specifically looking at the font-size on the body tag?
[16:29:00] <eddiemonge> __p__: you do know what types are allowed in javascript right?
[16:29:16] <__p__> nothing
[16:29:17] <eddiemonge> LordThumper: yeah. i think its slightly complicated. might be useful to find a plugin
[16:29:50] <__p__> nope
[16:30:21] <eddiemonge> __p__: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_Variables,_and_Literals
[16:30:26] <__p__> i am a c coder not web programer,
[16:32:09] <Fidelix> Can someone tell me why this doesn't work? There is no error on the console: http://pastebin.com/Uh0sScBZ
[16:33:02] <Wiz_KeeD> if i would like to redirect the user to another part of the page and when the loading is done i'd like to display a message like an alert whatever, how should i proceed?
[16:33:25] <eddiemonge> __p__: no problem
[16:33:56] <eddiemonge> Wiz_KeeD: say what? can you break down those questions into separate parts?
[16:34:15] <Wiz_KeeD> redirect user to index.php, once that is done, alert ("done")
[16:34:22] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: what doesnt work. "doesnt work" is pretty vague
[16:35:06] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: also, im not sure if textarea's have a load event
[16:35:22] <eddiemonge> Wiz_KeeD: javascript redirect?
[16:35:29] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah, whatever
[16:35:39] <eddiemonge> Wiz_KeeD: window.location
[16:35:48] <Wiz_KeeD> and then?
[16:36:04] <eddiemonge> Wiz_KeeD: although that page wont know how it got loaded unless you are passing a query string param or something like that
[16:36:30] <eddiemonge> Wiz_KeeD: generally the page having been loaded is the notification that it loaded
[16:36:34] <zduffy> How can I auto populate textfields without posting to a form? I want to do it live
[16:37:10] <eddiemonge> ?val @ zduffy
[16:37:10] <bot-t> zduffy, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[16:37:11] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, that must be it. Do you have another suggestion, eddiemonge?
[16:37:12] <donCams> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/2reYz/
[16:37:15] <__p__> $('content').bind('keyup', function(){alert('Ola');}); is not working
[16:37:38] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: are you loading the textarea in or something? or is it coming in with the rest of the page?
[16:38:03] <eddiemonge> __p__: .content maybe?
[16:38:14] <__p__> $('#content').bind('keyup', function(){alert('Ola');}); is not working
[16:38:30] <eddiemonge> what is #content?
[16:38:47] <__p__> <input id="content" name="content" />
[16:38:51] <eddiemonge> what version of jquery?
[16:38:55] <zduffy> eddiemonge: I have it posting from a form to a query, and the data is pulling from a query. Im not sure exactly what to do with val?
[16:39:08] <eddiemonge> __p__: where/when is your javascript being loaded?
[16:39:12] <__p__> 1.8 i guess i dont check it
[16:39:25] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ zduffy
[16:39:25] <bot-t> zduffy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:39:35] <eddiemonge> ?version
[16:39:35] <bot-t> Docs: Version - http://api.jquery.com/category/Version/
[16:39:54] <eddiemonge> __p__: jQuery version 1.8?

[16:40:36] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, with the rest of the page
[16:42:01] <eddiemonge> __p__: so the input is getting loaded from an ajax request?
[16:42:15] <__p__> yes
[16:42:27] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: add the code in the doc.ready block then
[16:42:37] <eddiemonge> ? on delegate @ __p__
[16:42:38] <bot-t> __p__, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:43:01] <eddiemonge> __p__: you need to delegate that code then since when you are calling it, the element doesnt exist in the DOM yet
[16:44:03] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, it already is.
[16:45:03] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, if I do it with .once instead of .load, it works, but when I click a button that loads another textarea with ajax, then it gets messed up. Probably because all this code is called again.
[16:45:24] <__p__> eddiemonge:
[16:45:31] <__p__> $(elements).delegate(selector, events, data, handler);  // jQuery 1.4.3+
[16:45:33] <__p__> $(elements).on(events, selector, data, handler);        // jQuery 1.7+

[16:46:26] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, how do I do that?

[16:46:33] <someprimetime> ()*
[16:46:40] <eddiemonge> ?on delegate @ Fidelix
[16:46:40] <bot-t> Fidelix, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:46:56] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: there is only one instance
[16:47:33] <someprimetime> so you can't have an object with the same name occurring more than once?
[16:48:08] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: no. how would you have that?
[16:48:11] <donCams> someprimetime: i don't understand. sorry :\
[16:49:00] <someprimetime> hold on guys i have so much code namespaced this is gonna take me a little bit to move over to jsfiddle
[16:49:25] <__p__> $("#content").on("keyup", "value", function(){alert('ola');}); also not working
[16:50:26] <eddiemonge> __p__: $("#content's parent that is in the DOM and wont change").on("keyup", "#content", function() { console.log("Yo!"); });
[16:50:49] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, thanks for helping. I mean it. But I don't know what to delegate to.
[16:51:23] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: the closest parent in the page that wont change
[16:52:01] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, that helps a lot. But what about the second parameter? The event?
[16:53:11] <raiun> how can i get the value of an attribute of an element inside the callback function for the click event for that element?
[16:53:37] <Eviltwin> see ?.attr
[16:53:38] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[16:53:51] <__p__> #(content).on is not a function ( on error console )
[16:54:04] <raiun> ah got it thx
[16:54:16] <Eviltwin> jQuery prefers the $ to the #
[16:54:28] <__p__> thank you for your help!
[17:04:35] <cesaro> i have these inline html buttons in my datatable, and they work perfectly until i switch to page2
[17:04:39] <cesaro> at which point they dont trigger :o
[17:04:54] <cesaro> i am using this selector
[17:04:56] <cesaro> $(".delete:input[type=button]").click(function () {
[17:08:49] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:09:05] <lenswipe> im doing some ajax magic but im not sure how to loop over a JSON array to produce a series of elements
[17:09:10] <cesaro> ah do.
[17:09:10] <lenswipe> ill pastebin what i have so far hold on
[17:09:11] <cesaro> h
[17:09:20] <cesaro> i needed to put my selector above the datatable.
[17:09:24] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: sorry. what was your question?
[17:09:35] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/bh9ejNky
[17:09:38] <lenswipe> thats it
[17:10:30] <_k4> lenswipe: keep going.
[17:10:48] <lenswipe> _k4, i want each json item to be a new HTML element if you see what i mean
[17:11:24] <lenswipe> _k4, so i want a list of blogposts powered by AJAX
[17:12:06] <_k4> All I see is a for loop with nothing done to the index.
[17:12:09] <_k4> with the index.
[17:12:12] <lenswipe> yeah
[17:12:16] <lenswipe> im not sure where to go from here
[17:12:22] <lenswipe> im really new to this stuff
[17:12:49] <_k4> OK next is    var x = data[item];
[17:13:16] <_k4> X is the next value in the array data.  What it to do with it depends on what it is.
[17:13:55] <lenswipe> well it will be a blogpost with attributes
[17:14:06] <lenswipe> _k4, would it help if i linked you to the raw JSON so you could see what i was trying to do?
[17:14:24] <eddiemonge> anyone in the SF bay area?
[17:14:53] <_k4> Just pastebin some of the json so we get a flavor.
[17:15:04] <lenswipe> _k4, its really not that big, theres like 3 objects
[17:15:15] <lenswipe> http://viderotec.pagodabox.com/blog/feed/json
[17:15:30] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, that helps a lot. But what about the second parameter? The event?
[17:16:10] <lenswipe> _k4, http://pastebin.com/RKJZ3BB4
[17:16:16] <lenswipe> that might be a bit less hellish to read
[17:16:31] <_k4> I'm not sure that php will work.
[17:16:37] <lenswipe> its not PHP
[17:16:41] <lenswipe> its JSON
[17:16:57] <_k4> Sorry I was referring to the php in the script.
[17:17:00] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: im actually not quite sure what you are doing. it looks like you only need to call that function whenever that element is added to the page and the function is dependant on the element
[17:17:06] <lenswipe> _k4, wha?
[17:17:14] <lenswipe> it should work, its parsed before the javascript
[17:17:14] <_k4> <?php echo site_url('ajax/getjson') ?>
[17:17:16] <_k4> That
[17:17:17] <lenswipe> yeah
[17:17:22] <lenswipe> that will work because its parsed server side
[17:17:28] <lenswipe> so that will produce domain.com/ajax/getjson
[17:17:29] <_k4> OK
[17:17:30] <lenswipe> :)
[17:17:31] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, correct
[17:17:40] <lenswipe> not only will it - it does :
[17:17:40] <lenswipe> :p
[17:17:43] <_k4> You know it returns what you pasted?
[17:17:45] <_k4> OK
[17:18:10] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: then call that function in the callback for whatever is adding that textbox
[17:18:48] <_k4> So now you need to loop over the array extracting the objects you show in the json.
[17:19:00] <lenswipe> _k4, yeah i know
[17:19:20] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, I don't know how. I'm using a CMS (Drupal). And it looks like the function is executed when it adds the textbox, that's why I'm using the "Drupal.Behaviors" stuff.
[17:19:20] <lenswipe> _k4, yeah, the stage im at is i have json objects and i need to display them in HTML
[17:19:48] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, the problem is that when it runs the function again, the textboxes stop working
[17:20:00] <_k4> Do you have a template of some kind?
[17:20:06] <lenswipe> _k4, me?
[17:20:09] <_k4> Yes
[17:20:13] <lenswipe> what kind of template?
[17:20:27] <lenswipe> only the HTML template ive made for my site
[17:20:38] <lenswipe> but like im the coder and stuff here so shiz can change :)
[17:20:40] <_k4> I mean what exactly do you want to do with the "Id" or "Post" or ...
[17:20:49] <eddiemonge> Fidelix: sorry not sure. i find drupal to be a pita
[17:20:54] <lenswipe> _k4, see the json objects?
[17:20:59] <_k4> Yes
[17:21:04] <lenswipe> they're very nice but they're not much good to the end user
[17:21:08] <_k4> Yes
[17:21:10] <lenswipe> i need that info displayed on my page in HTML
[17:21:14] <Fidelix> eddiemonge, alright. Thank you so much for your help... I appreciate it.
[17:21:59] <_k4> well you probably need to display them in some sort of table or set of controls or ....? whatever.
[17:22:33] <_k4> I can't tell you what to do with them.  You'll have to decide about that.
[17:23:00] <_k4> At this point, the best thing you could do with them is put them in a grid.
[17:23:40] <_k4> Do you need for the user to be able to edit the data or just display it?
[17:24:02] <lenswipe> _k4, im asking you how to get it from JSON object to HTML
[17:24:06] <lenswipe> just display it
[17:24:19] <lenswipe> how do i make it visible on my page
[17:24:25] <lenswipe> thats the part im not getting
[17:25:06] <_k4> http://datatables.net/  this is what I think you need to use maybe??
[17:25:27] <lenswipe> um no
[17:25:37] <lenswipe> _k4, ill explain again okay?
[17:25:53] <_k4> What format do you want the data to be displayed in?
[17:25:59] <lenswipe> HTML
[17:26:08] <lenswipe> dont care how its laid out right now
[17:26:11] <_k4> Sorry that makes no sense.
[17:26:12] <lenswipe> i just want to get it from JSON to HTML
[17:26:28] <xrfang> hi there, how can I disable *automatic* rendering of elements in jquery mobile? I would like to render those element MANUALLY using calls like $('element').trigger('create');
[17:26:29] <lenswipe> it makes a lot of sense i just think we arent understanding each other very well
[17:26:36] <_k4> I agree.
[17:26:56] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: you have json coming from the server that you want to disply on your page as html?
[17:27:07] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, YES! YES EXACTLY!
[17:27:07] <_k4> He does.
[17:27:19] <_k4> But it's an array of objects.
[17:27:22] <undecim> How do I tell if a given element exists?
[17:27:27] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: then you will need to a templating plugin/library
[17:27:42] <lenswipe> so i cant just have it create elements on the fly?
[17:27:47] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: or else loop through the json constructing the html manually
[17:27:58] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: do you know what json is?
[17:28:01] <lenswipe> yes
[17:28:05] <_k4> eddiemonge: Look at his data.
[17:28:13] <eddiemonge> link?
[17:28:22] <lenswipe> http://viderotec.pagodabox.com/blog/feed/json
[17:28:35] <_k4> You'll see what http://pastebin.com/RKJZ3BB4
[17:28:40] <_k4> That's his data.
[17:28:56] <_k4> So I'm trying to figure out what format he wants it in.
[17:29:05] <_k4> Data tables didn't satisfy him.
[17:29:21] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: ok and how do you want it displayed?
[17:29:29] <_k4> Which is a pretty good way of displaying the data without knowing what he wants.
[17:29:39] <_k4> eddiemonge: good luck.
[17:29:51] <_k4> eddiemonge: he wants it displayed as HTML!
[17:29:55] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: if you were constructing this on your own on the server? what would your html markup look like?
[17:30:35] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, http://imagebin.org/201312
[17:30:36] <lenswipe> like that
[17:30:44] <lenswipe> i want the JSON to look like that
[17:30:54] <lenswipe> just plain old <h3>s and <p>s
[17:31:01] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: ignore json for a bit. what does that look like in terms of html?
[17:31:12] <_k4> Ha!
[17:31:14] <lenswipe> want a pastebin?
[17:31:59] <eddiemonge> ?pe
[17:31:59] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com otherwise I won't look at it. Pastebin.com sucks
[17:32:02] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, http://pastebin.com/hXsUwLtF
[17:32:27] <lenswipe> *sigh*
[17:32:48] <eddiemonge> ill make an exception this one time
[17:33:02] <_k4> eddiemonge: So you finally got him to give you what we wanted all along, bravo!
[17:33:12] <lenswipe> http://jsfiddle.net/EpCvd/
[17:33:25] <lenswipe> _k4, never once did you ask me for the HTML markup
[17:33:44] <_k4> I only asked what you wanted to do with it.
[17:33:49] <lenswipe> yeah
[17:33:55] <lenswipe> display it as HTML
[17:33:57] <_k4> All I got was html in response.
[17:34:09] <lenswipe> well i dont know how else i couldve explained it to you
[17:34:12] <_k4> The details might have been nice.
[17:34:20] <lenswipe> i dont know what details you wanted
[17:34:46] <lenswipe> im not doing this deliberately to annoy you, im doing it because i dont know what information you want unless you explicitly tell me
[17:34:49] <_k4> I suggested a table and you said no, but didn't give me a counter example.
[17:35:02] <_k4> OK np.  Sorry it took so long.
[17:35:05] <lenswipe> touche
[17:35:17] <lenswipe> its cool
[17:35:35] <__p__> http://pastebin.com/hMwbmzhK
[17:35:47] <_k4> So I guess eddiemonge  is off doing his thing in response.
[17:36:00] <eddiemonge> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/jtYTM/
[17:37:17] <_k4> eddiemonge: Do you mean (i) instead of (x)??
[17:37:29] <eddiemonge> __p__: $("#CouponDATA").on("keypress", "#content", function(e) {
[17:37:41] <_k4>   str += '<p>'+data[x].post+'</p>';
[17:37:44] <eddiemonge> _k4: yeah ;) i was typing it super fast
[17:37:46] <eddiemonge> whatev!
[17:38:31] <lenswipe> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/WkMbf/
[17:38:34] <lenswipe> does your code replace that?
[17:38:48] <_k4> http://jsfiddle.net/jtYTM/1/ is corrected.
[17:40:12] <_k4> You need to merge the two.
[17:40:31] <_k4> Use you ajax call and his loop logic.
[17:40:39] <_k4> you===your
[17:41:44] <lenswipe> i see
[17:41:54] <lenswipe> _k4, so his code goes where the .success stuff went?
[17:42:33] <_k4> Just replace your for loop with his.
[17:42:38] <lenswipe> or rather insi...yeah
[17:42:48] <__p__> eddiemonge: its valid on js but no change !
[17:43:09] <_k4> You do a for xx in yy he does for(i=0 ; i<data.length ...
[17:43:24] <__p__> $("#CouponDATA").on("keypress", "#content", function(e) { alert('hola')});
[17:43:27] <zduffy> How can I update a php variable with query live?
[17:43:42] <zduffy> jquery*
[17:45:02] <_k4> zduffy: generally you can't
[17:45:13] <__p__> zduffy: search $.get, $.post
[17:45:50] <zduffy> I have it set using $_POST but i do not want the browser to refresh
[17:45:53] <lenswipe> _k4, http://jsfiddle.net/WkMbf/1/
[17:46:03] <_k4> I think he's trying to set a php variable in a web page from javascript.
[17:46:10] <lenswipe> no i mnot
[17:46:23] <lenswipe> im echoing PHP data into my script dynamically
[17:46:32] <lenswipe> wait nevermind
[17:46:40] <lenswipe> so yeah
[17:46:51] <lenswipe> that doesnt work but i dont see anything in console or any error messages :/
[17:47:02] <_k4> http://jsfiddle.net/WkMbf/2/ maybe closer
[17:47:13] <zduffy> What I want to accomplish is to update a query to fill in a form automatically based on a string
[17:47:32] <_k4> jsfiddle doesn't through error messages as far as I know.
[17:47:38] <_k4> throw.
[17:48:07] <_k4> uszduffy: search $.get, $.post
[17:48:20] <lenswipe> _k4, i tried that - it gives me "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL"
[17:48:34] <WebDragon> http://browsershots.org/http://360.client-proof.com/home.php  so much for browsershots.org -- all blank even seamonkey
[17:48:44] <_k4> OK time to trouble shoot.
[17:48:46] <someprimetime> can i delete a property of an object if i don' tknow the object index but i know the value of a property within it?
[17:49:18] <zduffy> _k4: I have but I don't understand what to do for the data part
[17:49:19] <lenswipe> _k4, okay
[17:49:20] <_k4> First off, localhost isn't your local system.
[17:49:29] <lenswipe> _k4, yes it is
[17:49:44] <_k4> Not in jsfiddle it isn't.
[17:49:47] <someprimetime> say my object is: Obj and it's index is 2, but I don't know it's 2.. but it has a property called hash: which a value of '123' â¦ can i reference that object index by the value of that hash property?
[17:50:01] <_k4> What browser?
[17:50:10] <someprimetime> something like files[IDONTKNOWTHEINDEX].hash == '123'
[17:50:58] <lenswipe> _k4, oh i see
[17:51:00] <lenswipe> yeah
[17:51:23] <lenswipe> was that "what browser" addressed to me, _k4 ?
[17:51:34] <_k4> So you need to move the code to your system and use the debugger your browser has.
[17:51:44] <_k4> Yes IE?
[17:51:47] <lenswipe> ew no
[17:51:48] <lenswipe> Chrome
[17:51:53] <lenswipe> its running on my system
[17:52:07] <_k4> OK then you have a chance of making it work.
[17:52:20] <lenswipe> hmm
[17:52:26] <_k4> Not so if you have IE.  :/
[17:53:03] <lenswipe> lol IE is a peice of shit, lets get it working in a web browser first (IE doesnt count as a browser in my book)
[17:53:19] <_k4> Keep a copy of FF around with FireBug installed too.  There are some times that Firebug will give you info that Chrome won't.
[17:53:31] <lenswipe> ok
[17:54:14] <lenswipe> _k4, im getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[17:54:30] <_k4> Do you see a line number?
[17:55:14] <lenswipe> yeah line 155
[17:55:28] <_k4> In what file?
[17:55:28] <lenswipe> thats this line:  str += '</div>';
[17:55:54] <donCams> lenswipe: what's the line before that
[17:56:09] <lenswipe>                         }
[17:56:20] <_k4> Pastbin the file.
[17:56:21] <gnarf> someprimetime: you want to know the index? or do you just want the object?
[17:56:22] <lenswipe> okay
[17:56:54] <lenswipe> http://pastebin.com/uXCUUk5Z
[17:57:33] <_k4>   for (var i = 0, l = data.length; i < l; i++) {

[17:57:45] <gnarf> someprimetime: ^^^
[17:57:46] <_k4> That's the first thing I see wrong
[17:58:03] <_k4> Oh, never mind.
[17:59:29] <lenswipe> ..
[17:59:37] <lenswipe> so what do i need to do to fix this?
[18:00:44] <donCams> lenswipe: use $.each instead
[18:01:04] <lenswipe> donCams, ...?
[18:01:04] <donCams> and you have two ; before ajax
[18:01:23] <donCams> i'm sorry. i mean on your success function
[18:01:26] <lenswipe> donCams, you need to be telling EdwardIII
[18:01:31] <lenswipe> no wait
[18:01:42] <lenswipe> some other dude called eddit something who has now left
[18:01:56] * imsky is the grillest
[18:02:22] <catcher> if you return false in a click event handler, does the click never complete?
[18:04:04] <tw2113> that's my understanding
[18:04:35] <catcher> seems to be behaving that way, just want to make sure I understand.
[18:05:01] <catcher> In my click handler, I'm returning the results of a confirm, and it works. (true completes action, false bails)
[18:05:03] <donCams> lenswipe: i thought that was your question. anyway, try this out whoever is asking http://pastebin.com/J5dvQZiP
[18:05:06] <_k4> lenswipe: jslint doesn't like it
[18:05:16] <lenswipe> hmm
[18:06:05] <lenswipe> donCams, unexpected identifier
[18:06:12] <lenswipe> line 146
[18:06:50] <zduffy> _k4: is my syntax correct here? http://pastebin.com/BQAi6043
[18:09:30] <zduffy> Something is off because its not auto populating my textboxes
[18:10:43] <_k4> zduffy: Syntax is OK passes jslint
[18:10:56] <_k4> lenswipe: Something is wierd.
[18:11:07] <someprimetime> gnarf: just went to move my car
[18:11:12] <someprimetime> that is EXACTLY what i was looking for
[18:11:12] <someprimetime> +++
[18:11:13] <someprimetime> thanks
[18:11:14] <someprimetime> :D
[18:11:18] <_k4> jslint is complaining about the for loop.
[18:11:18] <someprimetime> hell yeah
[18:11:36] <lenswipe> _k4, you're telling me
[18:13:19] <zduffy> _k4: here is ajax-customer.php http://pastebin.com/XqTVr4wx
[18:13:22] <_k4> I have no idea why at this point.
[18:13:28] <someprimetime> damn bro thanks
[18:13:38] <someprimetime> gnarf for president you don't realize how much that helped me
[18:14:31] <_k4> zduffy: shouldn't you be printing something from that php?
[18:14:49] <zduffy> I do in another php file..
[18:14:55] <_k4> OK
[18:15:10] <_k4> And if you do it from the command line does it work right?
[18:16:23] <zduffy> k4: http://pastebin.com/4uewUVXK
[18:17:22] <zduffy> If I set the customer text box with $_POST it fires the query fine and auto populates all textboxs
[18:17:36] <zduffy> But I don't want POST I want GET so I can do it live
[18:18:17] <zduffy> onkeyup does not fire the ajax request i think
[18:20:36] <donCams> lenswipe. also put return false on your click function
[18:23:06] <_k4> lenswipe: I can't help
[18:23:10] <_k4> Gotta run...
[18:24:34] <zduffy> Anyone else be willing to help me?
[18:25:19] <lenswipe> _k4, thanks for all that you did!
[18:25:21] <lenswipe> donCams, will do
[18:26:44] <lenswipe> donCams, http://pastebin.com/ZA86VJsc
[18:26:46] <lenswipe> like that?
[18:27:24] <donCams> yeah. but try this instead http://pastebin.com/Tj4xgdfN
[18:27:31] <donCams> you have firebug on firefox right?
[18:27:53] <lenswipe> donCams, chrom eweb inspector
[18:28:04] <donCams> that's ok
[18:28:25] <lenswipe> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[18:28:27] <lenswipe> :(
[18:28:50] <lenswipe> its highlighting that str_push() on line 15
[18:29:55] <__p__> how i can change input value
[18:30:04] <__p__> in jquery
[18:34:02] <__p__> FIXED:  $('#total').val(t);
[18:36:53] * lenswipe pokes don
[18:42:32] <sam113101> what does .tabs() (jquery ui) return?
[18:43:12] <Eviltwin> The collection you called it on
[18:43:25] <Eviltwin> var foo = $)
[18:43:27] <Eviltwin> Err
[18:43:33] <Eviltwin> var foo = $(".mytabs");
[18:43:38] <Eviltwin> foo.tabs() === foo
[18:44:02] <sam113101> ok
[18:45:35] <someprimetime> can select the member of an object by it's property value by going: $(obj).filter(function() { this.pseudoHash == 123;}).get(); which returns to me either true or false if it exists.. but how can i get the index of that specific member? or delete the member altogether?
[18:46:18] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[18:46:19] <bot-t> Code is King. We don't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[18:48:16] <tocka> Hey, is any1 still alive?:)
[18:48:23] <Eviltwin> But I think you're going to want: var obj = {...}; $.each(obj, function(k) { if(<condition>) { console.log("at key: "+k); } else if(<other condition>) { delete obj[k]; } });
[18:48:26] <sam113101> IÂ am
[18:48:33] <tocka> Sweet;]
[18:49:40] <tocka> I have this jQuery script that shows random divs, but it seems after 4-5 refreshes its stuck on to a never ending loop or something and I cant figure out where the problem is
[18:49:40] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/5xG7RGV8
[18:50:36] <Eviltwin> This is a bad technique for this
[18:51:40] <tocka> Eviltwin you are talking about my code or someone elses? :)
[18:51:44] <Eviltwin> Yours
[18:51:58] <tocka> Whats the problem then ? :/
[18:52:43] <Eviltwin> Say there are 10 testimonials and you only have one left to show
[18:52:51] <Eviltwin> It's going to keep generating random numbers until it's that last one
[18:53:01] <Eviltwin> And only has a 10% of getting it right
[18:53:51] <tocka> So lets say would it help if after every refresh the scripts starts again with no testimonials being shown?
[18:54:01] <tocka> I just want it to show 2 different ones lets say
[18:54:05] <tocka> 9-10
[18:54:08] <tocka> 8-1
[18:54:10] <tocka> and so on
[18:54:16] <tocka> That they wouldnt duplicate
[18:55:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/j6G5k/
[18:56:20] <Eviltwin> Oops, I meant this: http://jsfiddle.net/j6G5k/1/
[18:56:51] <tocka> Eviltwin thank you :)
[19:07:32] <aqeel> hi room
[19:09:48] <aqeel> which is adviced......should i specify two seperate functions into hover hover(function1,function2)...or use if else clause in one function......hover(if true function 1 else function 2)
[19:10:10] <shoelessone> long shot: anybody happen to know the website that allows you to send a link to a computer-dumb person and it will automatically email you all of the information about their browser, IP address, etc?
[19:11:59] <gnarf> aqeel: personally, I prefer .on({ mouseenter: fn1, mouseleave: fn2 }) unless whatever you want is really similar and only needs to know if entering: .on("mouseenter mouseleave", function( event ) { var entering=event.type=="mouseenter" })
[19:13:42] <aqeel> thanks....so i should use on...
[19:14:59] <aqeel> will look into that possibility......thanks
[19:17:32] <Strfns> Can anyone take a look at this please? https://gist.github.com/1937288
[19:18:02] <gnarf> Strfns: var that=this
[19:18:25] <gnarf> Strfns: animation callbacks are called in the context of the element
[19:18:41] <gnarf> so you can "var that=this" in the outer scope -- or you can jQuery.proxy( fn, this )
[19:18:43] <gnarf> ?proxy
[19:18:44] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[19:30:17] <Strfns> gnarf, I'm pretty new to this. This is what I tried with the proxy https://gist.github.com/1937363 but I'm guessing it's wrong (it doesn't work)
[19:30:59] <Strfns> doing var allows me to access the value of this.ready in the callback, but not to set it on the outer level
[19:31:02] <gnarf> jQuery not JQuery
[19:31:09] <gnarf> var that = this;
[19:31:12] <gnarf> that.ready
[19:32:54] <Strfns> Fixing jQuery worked, thanks!
[19:33:22] <gnarf> Strfns: that should have been obvious if you were using a javascript debugger ;) -- chrome inspector or firebug
[19:34:03] <Strfns> Yep I was going to look at the console, honest :P
[20:09:43] <aqeel> well on seems good but would not that add more lines to do things....hover takes care of 2 at same time.....on, have to specify individually
[20:10:00] <raiun> im trying to detect a click event on an element but theres an absolutely positioned div holding an image on top of it
[20:10:18] <raiun> if the user clicks part of the image it doesnt click on the element im detecting
[20:10:19] <aqeel> use z-index
[20:10:32] <raiun> but i need that image to be on top of the element
[20:10:34] <donCams> raiun: yes, z-index
[20:11:01] <raiun> if i take the z index of the img down it wont show over the element im displaying
[20:11:02] <donCams> #yourElement { background: transparent; }
[20:11:03] <jrockjiggz> make empty clear div ontop
[20:11:04] <aqeel> use your jquery to chage its z-index
[20:11:29] <donCams> why don't you just make the image clickable instead?
[20:11:37] <aqeel> yeah?
[20:12:24] <raiun> because im using the same image for 2 different types of elements
[20:12:32] <raiun> different behaviors for clicking on them
[20:12:57] <donCams> raiun: add a class then make them images backgrounds of those block elements
[20:14:07] <kaylee> anyone alive?
[20:14:09] <donCams> <a href="#" class="imgSame"></a> css => .imgSame { display: block; background: transparent url(img/url) no-repeat 0 0; }
[20:14:34] <donCams> then some height and width of course
[20:17:13] <aqeel> kaylee dead rppms comes alive when asked
[20:17:21] <aqeel> room*
[20:17:22] <kaylee> woo!
[20:17:24] <kaylee> ZOMBIE ROOM!!
[20:17:33] <aqeel> yeah
[20:17:41] <donCams> brains!
[20:19:17] <kaylee> so I have some jquery stuff that I want to have fetch another html file, and load it's contents into a div
[20:19:33] <aqeel> well use load
[20:19:35] <kaylee> .... is there an easy way to test this locally while I'm working on things if I don't have a web server?
[20:19:44] <aqeel> sure
[20:19:46] <kaylee> or is that just not workable at all
[20:19:50] <Whirl3d> get a web server
[20:19:56] <kaylee> :/ well duh
[20:19:58] <Whirl3d> I use the webserver built into php
[20:20:02] <Whirl3d> sorry, nusphere
[20:20:06] <Whirl3d> phpeditor
[20:20:10] <kaylee> don't have one handy at the moment, and I don't wanna install/setup crap
[20:20:18] <aqeel> lol
[20:20:30] <aqeel> then u r out of luck for local testing
[20:20:34] <kaylee> boo
[20:20:46] <kaylee> nice to have a full answer
[20:20:53] <Whirl3d> It's a lot easier to waste all of our time than installing a piece of software. Nice.
[20:21:14] <kaylee> as if it really took SO much of your time
[20:21:30] <Whirl3d> troll
[20:21:32] <kaylee> much less than installing a server on my machine
[20:21:43] <aqeel> please do not flame.....and these days server setup is not that all difficult....
[20:21:55] <kaylee> pfft, you're far too easily butt hurt Whirl3d
[20:21:59] <jrockjiggz> its a worthy investment of time
[20:22:04] <aqeel> small, mini, full fledge...all type of server are there
[20:22:14] <kaylee> aqeel: mainly it's just a pain at home because of minimal download capability
[20:22:38] <kaylee> I have hosting elsewhere... just not at the moment (which is why I didn't already have a server on this machine)
[20:22:39] <Whirl3d> windows, mac or unix?
[20:23:23] <kaylee> unix
[20:23:44] <kaylee> with only my cell phone and spotty service for network access at the moment
[20:24:09] <kaylee> just need to limp at the moment...
[20:24:43] <Whirl3d> you could try jsfiddle.net, but not sure it would do what you want.
[20:25:36] <kaylee> thanks
[20:32:05] <Uncle_Mother> in between one form (for searching for a valid user given an id) and another (for adding a new user), there's an ajax post to do the actual search. If I press back button on the second form, it goes back to the "post" state from the search method
[20:41:43] <Whirl3d> Uncle_Mother, when it's rainy outside, I get sad. So?
[20:41:58] <Uncle_Mother> ?
[20:42:08] <Whirl3d> did you have a question?
[20:42:26] <Whirl3d> Or some code we could look at
[20:42:28] <Uncle_Mother> yes-  actually
[20:42:32] <Uncle_Mother> putting that into a pastebin now
[20:42:40] <Whirl3d> You rock.
[20:42:44] <Uncle_Mother> what is the official pastebin for this channel?
[20:42:49] <Uncle_Mother> i may owe you my first healthy firstborn
[20:42:51] <Whirl3d> jsfiddle.net
[20:43:15] <Uncle_Mother> hm. i'm trying to pull out only the relevant stuff from a giant asp page. lemme see here
[20:43:23] <Whirl3d> although it's not pastebin, I prefer it and I have heard others on here do too.
[20:43:39] <Uncle_Mother> hm. let me see if i can unmangle it; not so familiar iwth it yet
[20:44:15] <Whirl3d> Before you go to that trouble, perhaps you could just handle the keypress incident and check to see if it's backspace. If it is and a field is not in focus, prevent default.
[20:45:41] <Uncle_Mother> i'm not sure it's that simple. maybe i can explain it better
[20:46:11] <Uncle_Mother> I have a search field for a student ID; it's in its own form. I use jqvalidate but that shouldn't matter for this question
[20:46:35] <Uncle_Mother> click the search button (input submit for #searchForm) - do an ajax post to an asp page that returns results
[20:46:58] <Whirl3d> okay
[20:46:59] <Uncle_Mother> if the user isn't found, an "Add User" form in a hidden div is shown
[20:47:11] <Uncle_Mother> focus goes to the "first name" field, for example
[20:47:17] <Whirl3d> got ya
[20:47:24] <Uncle_Mother> if i screw up and try to press the back button - like i screwed up the ID the first time
[20:47:36] <Uncle_Mother> it goes back to page.asp?studentid=2123
[20:47:39] <Uncle_Mother> basically before the ajax post
[20:47:41] <Uncle_Mother> but not back to the first state
[20:47:51] <Uncle_Mother> so the ajax post is in the middle of the two forms if tha tmakes sense
[20:48:10] <Uncle_Mother> i suspect i'm going to have this problem a lot since i post to other pages for data a lot
[20:48:19] <Uncle_Mother> did i explain that right?
[20:49:14] <Whirl3d> So in the first form, where you enter the userID (incorrectly), you use submit to ajaxPost to an asp page that returns a result
[20:49:30] <Whirl3d> if the result is "error", for example, you show the "addUser" div
[20:49:57] <Uncle_Mother> well - the userid is an R and 8 characters. if your input matches that pattern it does a search
[20:50:06] <Uncle_Mother> if it gets a hit, it says "hey - this user exists"
[20:50:11] <Uncle_Mother> if it doesn't, it thinks it's a new user
[20:50:27] <Uncle_Mother> so the use case is - i type a "valid" number (matches the pattern) R12345678
[20:50:32] <Uncle_Mother> but really I meant to type R12345679
[20:51:04] <DreamHazard> hey guys, I'm trying to implement multiple popup divs activated by buttons, but I can only get the first to work, how do I set up multiple instances of the popup?
[20:51:11] <Whirl3d> it displays the NewUser div
[20:51:16] <Uncle_Mother> so i'm in the "add" form after the search posted, so hitting back is going to put me at the state where the post has happened; the url shows page.asp?searchfield=R12345678
[20:51:21] <Uncle_Mother> right
[20:51:22] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/gjxPs/
[20:51:33] <aqeel> any suggestions on how to optimize it
[20:51:45] <Whirl3d> but what if you checked for the backspace key
[20:51:58] <Whirl3d> if it's pressed, then return to page.asp
[20:51:59] <Uncle_Mother> actually backspace isn't what screws it - it's the back button
[20:52:31] <Whirl3d> Oh, I see what you are asking
[20:52:43] <Whirl3d> you need a .ready handler for your page
[20:52:47] <Uncle_Mother> ah
[20:53:17] <Whirl3d> that way, after the page loads, you can strip the ?searchfield=R12345  from the location
[20:53:25] <Uncle_Mother> yeah
[20:53:26] <Shazer[2]> Hey. :)
[20:53:26] <Uncle_Mother> that's right
[20:53:30] <Uncle_Mother> <3
[20:53:40] <Whirl3d> aqeel, I'm looking now
[20:53:51] <aqeel> thanks
[20:55:10] <Whirl3d> only thing I can see is that you could be using .on instead of hover
[20:55:13] <Shazer[2]> How are we all?
[20:55:33] <Uncle_Mother> the pastebin is here: http://pastebin.com/KkNGrhXF   I didn't know how to make it less complicated for a jsfiddle to get it actually in there and productive
[20:56:21] <aqeel> well thee is alot of hype on using of on()
[20:56:22] <Whirl3d> $(indexlinkID).parent().on({mouseenter:function (e) {....}, mouseleave:function ( e) {....}});
[20:56:28] <aqeel> might explain....further
[20:56:35] <Shazer[2]> You don't close the script tag?
[20:56:59] <Whirl3d> it's so much better to use .on in my opinion. Only one handler for your items, not a bunch of handlers
[20:57:10] <Whirl3d> plus you can then add items and subtract items easier
[20:57:16] <Whirl3d> .on handles it for you
[20:57:35] <aqeel> thanks...
[20:57:56] <Whirl3d> And if you code it right, your one handler could handle sub-menus and sub-sub menus
[20:58:01] <DreamHazard> can anyone help me, I need to create multiple instances of a button-activated popup div
[20:58:28] <Whirl3d> in fact, the one .on handler could handle any number of dynamically created submenus without every having to change the code.
[20:58:43] <DreamHazard> I can get one button to work, but the others don't
[20:58:46] <Whirl3d> * so long as your events are allowed to bubble.
[20:58:59] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, what's the problem
[20:59:12] <Whirl3d> we will need to see some code to be able to help
[20:59:22] <Whirl3d> there are a million ways to do what you are trying to do
[20:59:30] <DreamHazard> I'm following a tutorial, one sec
[20:59:35] <DreamHazard> http://yensdesign.com/2008/09/how-to-create-a-stunning-and-smooth-popup-using-jquery/
[20:59:49] <DreamHazard> I can get one of them to work, but I can't get the others to follow suit
[21:01:14] <Whirl3d> so, the way that popup works is by overlaying a div over all of your page contents (which prohibits them from receiveing mouse click events)
[21:01:44] <DreamHazard> sure
[21:02:13] <raiun> is there an event for detecting a change in the number of children in an element?
[21:02:29] <Whirl3d> you can't use the line: $(document).click(function() {disablePopup()});
[21:02:51] <Whirl3d> it will never let the click event hit the underlying buttons. That's the point of having it.
[21:03:12] <Whirl3d> raiun, not that I am aware of
[21:03:21] <raiun> any idea how to accomplish that?
[21:03:36] <DreamHazard> I don't follow.
[21:04:32] <Whirl3d> if you have a div on top of a button, then you try to click the button, it won't receive the click event
[21:04:39] <DreamHazard> just using the first button, I can open and close the popup as much as I like
[21:05:00] <Whirl3d> just using any of the buttons, you should be able to open and close the popup as much as you like.
[21:05:20] <Whirl3d> But you can't access a second button (and it's popup) while the first button's popup is active.
[21:05:47] <DreamHazard> it doesn't need to be while the first button's popup is active
[21:06:05] <DreamHazard> if I click the second button, even before the first, it doesn't open the second popup
[21:06:15] <Whirl3d> then how are you selecting your buttons? If you are following the tut you have assigned each button a unique ID
[21:06:31] <Whirl3d> Are you using the ID selector to select your buttons, or did you just give them all the same ID?
[21:06:41] <DreamHazard> I think they all have the same
[21:06:52] <Whirl3d> No two elements can have the same id
[21:06:56] <Whirl3d> instead, use a class
[21:07:03] <DreamHazard> right, how do I go about doing that?
[21:07:17] <Whirl3d> <button class='someClass">button</button>
[21:07:40] <Whirl3d> Then to select all of the buttons with the class attribute="someClass", you would use $(".someClass").click(function () {
[21:08:06] <Whirl3d> The "." operand in front of the class name tells the jquery engine it's a class-level selector
[21:08:27] <Whirl3d> the "#" tells the jquery engine it's the ID of a single element
[21:09:24] <DreamHazard> so "someclass" can be any class name I choose?
[21:09:32] <Whirl3d> correct
[21:09:51] <Whirl3d> it can even be multiple class names separated by a " " (space)
[21:10:43] <Whirl3d> <button class="big red buttonClass">Big Red</button><button class='big blue buttonClass">Blue Button</button>
[21:11:06] <Whirl3d> then to select all the blue buttonClass objects $(".blue.buttonClass")
[21:11:19] <Whirl3d> or all the buttonClass objects $(".buttonClass")
[21:11:28] <Whirl3d> or all the red object $(".red");
[21:11:44] <ngharo> Whirl3d for president
[21:12:05] <Whirl3d> ngharo, so sweet.
[21:12:13] <ngharo> :)
[21:12:20] <LekeFly> Anyone reason this shouldnt work? http://pastebin.com/mnbtqAU7 .. trying to use spin.js
[21:12:32] <LekeFly> with jQuery no conflict
[21:12:56] <DreamHazard> so how do I then get this to interface with the script? presumably I have to edit the js file somewhere to reflect this change
[21:13:25] <Uncle_Mother> thanks for your help whirl - i just did a total refresh of my screen and the problem doesn't happen. but i'm not convinced yet
[21:13:34] <Uncle_Mother> is it worth using one of those jquery history plugin thingies?
[21:13:44] <Cork> LekeFly: you could ALWAYS wrap your plugin in (function($) {})(jQuery);
[21:13:58] <Cork> LekeFly: and then you shouldn't have any problem
[21:14:10] <Whirl3d> I use jquery bbq
[21:14:14] <Cork> LekeFly: as your writing it right now; line 3 will break
[21:14:20] <Cork> and so on
[21:14:42] <LekeFly> Cork: Alright thanks! :)
[21:14:49] <Cork> np
[21:15:22] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, when you are creating your buttons, assign them all the same class (not the same id) then in your script where you normally went $("#button").click......you would use the "." instead of the "#"
[21:15:28] <DreamHazard> the magic line seems to be $("#button").click(function(){
[21:15:59] <Whirl3d> precisely. $(".button").cick(function () {}).....but don't use "button" as an ID or a classname,
[21:16:06] <Cork> LekeFly: and line 15 (if it goes outside the plugin, you should either do jQuery(function($) {});, or not use $ in it
[21:16:10] <DreamHazard> so I replace #button with .buttonclass
[21:16:11] <Whirl3d> use "myButton" or "popupButton"
[21:16:14] <DreamHazard> or whatever
[21:16:34] <Whirl3d> and make it class="popButton" not id="popClass"
[21:16:42] <LekeFly> Cork: Reading up on that now.. and its the same plugin
[21:17:42] <Cork> LekeFly: no i meant if line 15+ is meant to go into the plugin, and isn't just the invoktion of the plugin
[21:17:53] <LekeFly> Oh
[21:18:11] <DreamHazard> ok, now all the buttons are working, but they're bringing up the same popup regardless of the button pressed
[21:18:16] <LekeFly> Have i dont it right now? http://pastebin.com/b7cvcdVN
[21:18:40] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, that's the same problem
[21:18:51] <Cork> LekeFly: if its all meant to be the internals of the spin plugin; yes
[21:18:53] <LekeFly> At least its working now
[21:18:56] <Whirl3d> you are using an id when you need a class. But now the problem gets tricker
[21:18:59] <Whirl3d> trickier
[21:19:04] <LekeFly> Cork: Again thanks!:)
[21:19:13] <DreamHazard> ah, the content div has the same ID
[21:19:13] <Whirl3d> you need to have a way to identify which popup to show
[21:19:17] <Cork> LekeFly: though i suspects line 16+ is meant to be the call to invoke it rather then part of it
[21:19:34] <Whirl3d> Right. So one way to do it is to wrap each button/div pair in a div
[21:19:50] <DreamHazard> they are
[21:20:14] <Whirl3d> then you could use $(".buttonClass").click(function () {var msg=$(this).parent().find("div"); msg.fadeIn();}
[21:20:19] <LekeFly> Cork: Hmm.. might be :P i dont know much about jQuery.. heres the source https://gist.github.com/1161034
[21:20:20] <Whirl3d> roughly
[21:20:38] <Cork> LekeFly: i suspect this is what you want http://pastebin.com/RuGnXdcy
[21:20:58] <LekeFly> ah..
[21:21:23] <Cork> LekeFly: line 1-16 is the plugin; 18+ is just the ready handler invoking the plugin
[21:21:54] <LekeFly> Btw should this plugin work if its inside a ajax "refresh(?)" ?
[21:22:06] <Cork> refresh?
[21:22:07] <LekeFly> Or will that break it..
[21:22:24] <Cork> not sure what ajax refresh is
[21:22:42] <LekeFly> Dont know whats the correct word to use.. but say you update a div with ajax.. and the spinner is insde
[21:23:12] <Cork> generaly yes
[21:23:24] <Cork> though you will always have to think about what $ is
[21:23:36] <Cork> (thats the cost of noConflict)
[21:24:03] <LekeFly> Generaly break or work? :D
[21:24:08] <Cork> but if your ajax call is $.ajax, and its in a scope where $ is jQuery, then sure it should work just fine
[21:24:38] <DreamHazard> hmm, still displaying the same popup
[21:24:47] <Cork> if no, then it should work just fine as long as you use jQuery().spin and not $().spin
[21:25:33] <Cork> LekeFly: but thats local to the code you write; the plugin will work as long as you manage to call it
[21:25:58] <LekeFly> Hmm alright
[21:26:17] <Cork> LekeFly: btw just noticed line 32 should be $("#spin")
[21:26:48] <LekeFly> Cork: Ops. thanks :p
[21:33:13] <thinkclay> anyone have some insight as to why a jquery object wouldn't have access to the same file events as native elements http://jsfiddle.net/thinkclay/nVtgv/2/ (look at console log differences, I need access to the dataTransfer bit in particular)
[21:35:00] <pvel> gud morning
[21:35:16] <donCams> good afternoon
[21:35:32] <Cork> thinkclay: NEVER use on* properties
[21:35:58] <Cork> thinkclay: they always overwrite all event listners that already exist on the element
[21:36:10] <thinkclay> what should I use than Cork?
[21:36:33] <Cork> thinkclay: if you want to use javascript natives
[21:36:40] <pvel> if any way for whenever click tutorial link in menu bar it ill extend various tutorial link in same menu bar(like swing).
[21:36:45] <Cork> thinkclay: use addEventListner and attachEvent
[21:37:03] <Cork> *if you want to use javascript natives +
[21:37:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/thinkclay/nVtgv/2/
[21:37:12] <pvel> like accordion
[21:37:19] <thinkclay> Cork: I'd prefer use jquery events, but the drop event doesnt have the same methods
[21:37:44] <Cork> wfm
[21:37:44] <caniuse> Cork: Works For Me
[21:39:23] <thinkclay> it works, but do you see the dataTransfer property on the jquery event? I'm not getting it in Chrome
[21:39:34] <thinkclay> may well be a chrome related issue
[21:40:29] <initself> I'm trying to use .FixedHeaderTable()
[21:40:30] <initself> http://fixedheadertable.com/
[21:40:48] <initself> if i install the .js file, and tie this to my selector
[21:40:49] <initself> $('selector').fixedHeaderTable({ footer: false, cloneHeadToFoot: false, fixedColumn: false });
[21:40:52] <initself> is that all i need to do?
[21:40:58] <initself> i can't get jack to work
[21:41:53] <Cork> thinkclay: the event object is overriden in jquery
[21:42:09] <Cork> it uses a compatibility object to make all browser return the same set of values
[21:42:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/nVtgv/4/
[21:42:47] <thinkclay> Thanks Cork, I'll stick with the attached listeners then
[21:43:11] <Cork> thinkclay: if you check the code
[21:43:13] <Cork> both work
[21:43:22] <Cork> both the bind and the native
[21:47:25] <theBrettman> is there anything the opposite of add()?
[21:47:34] <theBrettman> for traversing?
[21:47:47] <Cork> ?.filter
[21:47:47] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[21:48:02] <Cork> hmm no
[21:48:06] <Cork> sorry its
[21:48:08] <Cork> ?.not
[21:48:08] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[21:48:17] <theBrettman> sweet
[21:48:31] <theBrettman> I was trying to find .subtract() lol
[21:48:38] <Shazer[2]> Hey #jquery, if I am checking for a keypress in JavaScript and that works and everything.. when I press enter, it should send some sort of response to say it was successful then if that happens how can I then isnert into a db with PHP?
[21:48:38] <Shazer[2]> insert*
[21:48:54] <theBrettman> I'm having chaining/traversing fun! :)
[21:49:09] <Cork> Shazer[2]: an ajax call
[21:49:20] <Shazer[2]> Cork.
[21:49:22] <Shazer[2]> Is that $.post?
[21:49:27] <Shazer[2]> I tried to understand that :S
[21:49:35] <Cork> its a short hand for it yes
[21:50:18] <Cork> $.get, $.post, $.getJSON is all shorthands for $.ajax
[21:50:31] <Shazer[2]> $.ajax({   type: 'POST',   url: url,   data: data,   success: success,   dataType: dataType });
[21:50:37] <Shazer[2]> That's an example of using $.ajax, right?
[21:50:41] <Shazer[2]> Sorry for code in channel btw.
[21:50:42] <Cork> yes
[21:50:51] <pvel> if there is any  way to whenever click tutorial link in menu bar it ill extend various tutorial link in same menu bar(like swing) .
[21:51:15] <Shazer[2]> ok cork
[21:51:19] <Shazer[2]> With the url, what does that mean?
[21:51:25] <Shazer[2]> Does that mean I specify the page that will be processing the data?
[21:51:35] <Cork> yes
[21:51:46] <DreamHazard> bah, thought I had it then.
[21:52:03] <Cork> like /update_database.php
[21:52:14] <caseyo> Are these synonymous:  $this.attr('disabled','disabled').siblings('button').removeAttr('disabled','disabled'); and $this.siblings('button').removeAttr('disabled','disabled').end().attr('disabled','disabled');
[21:52:28] <Shazer[2]> What about the data Cork?
[21:52:28] <caseyo> They both work. I'm just wondering if one is better than the other.
[21:52:34] <Shazer[2]> data is the data I want to send, right?
[21:52:45] <Shazer[2]> To the process page?
[21:53:02] <Cork> caseyo: yes they are, though the last does some more work
[21:53:13] <Cork> Shazer[2]: right
[21:53:28] <Shazer[2]> Cork: what about dataType?
[21:53:32] <caseyo> thank you cork
[21:53:52] <Cork> ?.ajax @ Shazer[2]
[21:53:52] <bot-t> Shazer[2], jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:54:00] <Cork> its all documented here
[21:54:32] <Shazer[2]> I'm looking at that Cork.
[21:54:42] <theBrettman> so say I add() something, run a function in the next part of the chain, and then I want to chain something else but not include what I added, I can use not() after or will that break the whole thing?
[21:54:54] <Shazer[2]> I got it.
[21:55:04] <Shazer[2]> Alright, so Cork, if I am passing a php value to the javascript
[21:55:07] <Shazer[2]> How is that taken in?
[21:55:22] <Shazer[2]> Like, if I am posting $_POST['text'] to the JavaScript how is that passed to data: ?
[21:55:24] <Cork> theBrettman: you can; though your prob better of doing it in the reverse order
[21:55:41] <theBrettman> oh, do it before add?
[21:55:44] <Cork> Shazer[2]: the success callback
[21:55:48] <Cork> theBrettman: yes
[21:55:53] <theBrettman> ok
[21:56:02] <Shazer[2]> What Cork/
[21:56:06] <Shazer[2]> no data:
[21:56:17] <Shazer[2]> How do I get the post variable sin javascript from PHP
[21:56:37] <theBrettman> u don't pass a post to javascript? u echo it to the request
[21:56:39] <Cork> Shazer[2]: the success callbacks first parameter
[21:56:53] <Shazer[2]> I got no idea Cork.
[21:56:55] <Shazer[2]> Can you help me?
[21:57:14] <Cork> Shazer[2]: and ya, the server has to print the data to the response stream
[21:57:35] <Shazer[2]> so so far it looks like this, Cork: http://screensnapr.com/v/1OgPR7.jpg
[21:57:49] <Cork> ugg.. jpg...
[21:58:05] <Cork> don't use images for code
[21:58:07] <Cork> ?p
[21:58:08] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:58:30] <Shazer[2]> Sorry.
[21:59:16] <Shazer[2]> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/3xakV/
[21:59:26] <theBrettman> u post to the php, do php stuff with $_POST['vars'] and then echo for a  text/html response or json_encode() it and include the header("Content-Type: application/json")
[22:00:10] <Shazer[2]> theBrettman, I mean.
[22:00:14] <theBrettman> I mostly json_encode unless depending...
[22:00:22] <theBrettman> on if I want just text/html
[22:00:41] <Shazer[2]> For example if I have index.php and i post $_POST['value'] from that to the Javascript how then can I do that to another file (from js to php) again?
[22:00:46] <theBrettman> json is js obj so it makes life ez
[22:01:00] <Shazer[2]> Like how do I get a post variable or any variable from the submitted php file in JS?
[22:01:04] <theBrettman> that doesn't go to javascript, ur backwards
[22:01:13] <theBrettman> u use the php to post
[22:01:23] <theBrettman> it posts to the php
[22:01:40] <Cork> Shazer[2]: everytime you want someting from the client to the server or from the server to the client
[22:01:49] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you need to do it through an ajax call
[22:01:53] <theBrettman> do what u want with the data in php and echo what u wanna send back to the javascript if u wanna send back anything at all
[22:01:54] <Shazer[2]> I'm lost...
[22:01:59] <Shazer[2]> Let me tell you exactly what I want to do..
[22:02:00] <theBrettman> just like a form
[22:02:10] <theBrettman> it posts to a server side script
[22:02:14] <theBrettman> that's what action is for
[22:02:16] <Cork> Shazer[2]: remember that php is server side, and js is client side, so they don't have access to eachother
[22:02:24] <theBrettman> tells the script to process the request
[22:02:37] <Shazer[2]> When I press submit, I want to get the submitted text from my textbox and evaluate it in js then post it to my process.php script
[22:02:39] <Shazer[2]> ?
[22:02:40] <theBrettman> .ajax() is so you can post with javascript without loading the page
[22:03:02] <Shazer[2]> Yeah, that's what I want theBrettman.
[22:03:07] <DreamHazard> is there any way to step through jquery?
[22:03:09] <Shazer[2]> I just want to be able to update the db without refreshing.
[22:03:09] <theBrettman> then use ajaxforms ajaxsubmit() to send it to ur server side code
[22:03:16] <theBrettman> it's a plugin
[22:03:20] <Shazer[2]> I've done it before theBrettman.
[22:03:24] <Shazer[2]> I didn't need ajaxsubmit()
[22:03:27] <Shazer[2]> I used $.post I think
[22:03:29] <Shazer[2]> or $.ajax
[22:03:45] <theBrettman> I prefer ajaxsubmit for that, less typing
[22:03:47] <Cork> Shazer[2]: what did you mean by another file btw?
[22:04:05] <Shazer[2]> Hmm, how can I explain this..
[22:04:07] <Shazer[2]> It's so hard to explain
[22:04:17] <theBrettman> next important thing is what do you want to get back for data?
[22:04:27] <Shazer[2]> I want to post my php variables to js so they can pass it to another file (processing file) to avoid refreshing
[22:04:38] <feathersanddown> http://jsfiddle.net/ySeHM/ <---- html is filled with getjson data correctly, but it don't replace into $('#categoria').html( )
[22:04:50] <theBrettman> ur confused
[22:05:08] <Shazer[2]> theBrettman, can you make an example on jsfiddle.net?
[22:05:09] <theBrettman> u mean u want javascript to post data to a server script
[22:05:17] <theBrettman> yes
[22:05:21] <Cork> Shazer[2]: your probably going about this the wrong way
[22:05:40] <feathersanddown> may be is for syncronism ? (time execution, condition race)
[22:06:01] <Cork> Shazer[2]: where are you getting the original php variable from, and do you have it at the time of page load?
[22:06:41] <Shazer[2]> Cork no
[22:07:05] <aqeel> whirl3d....can u give me something so i can follow
[22:07:16] <Cork> Shazer[2]: and js has to first the a php variable, then do something and then give that to php?
[22:07:25] <aqeel> i tried but this on() is ssomehow not working as intended
[22:07:30] <Cork> Shazer[2]: those two can't happen in the same ajax call?
[22:07:37] <aqeel> though it must work...
[22:07:37] <Whirl3d> aqeel, I've been away, show me what you have now
[22:07:48] <Shazer[2]> I'm lost
[22:07:48] <aqeel> ok...
[22:07:50] <Cork> Shazer[2]: as in the same php file request
[22:07:51] <Shazer[2]> Because so many people are talking
[22:08:27] <Shazer[2]> Cork, actually.
[22:08:33] <Shazer[2]> It only gets posted data when I press enter (check in JS)..
[22:08:46] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you shouldn't think about webpage handling as files, its data streams - up stream and down stream
[22:08:58] <Cork> Shazer[2]: to be able to get a down stream you have to do an up stream
[22:09:44] <Cork> so $.post(url, data, function(response) { /* do something with the response from the server */ });
[22:10:48] <Shazer[2]> Cork, can you do an example?
[22:10:54] <Cork> i just did
[22:10:56] <Shazer[2]> If I am wanting to get what I enter in a textbox
[22:11:08] <Shazer[2]> And post that to process.php (without refrehing through js)
[22:11:11] <Shazer[2]> then process in process.php
[22:11:35] <Cork> Shazer[2]: then add what you get in response to the textbox
[22:12:31] <Shazer[2]> What?
[22:12:33] <Shazer[2]> See, I'm lost as
[22:13:13] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d, you still about? I'm getting somewhere with this, at least
[22:13:15] <Cork> Shazer[2]: where are you getting lost?
[22:13:25] <Shazer[2]> I don't know Cork, I can't understand it all
[22:13:32] <Shazer[2]> Can you do a visual example? On jsfiddle.net?
[22:13:33] <Shazer[2]> Please
[22:13:39] <Cork> not really
[22:13:47] <Whirl3d> still here
[22:13:50] <Cork> jsfiddle doesn't work werry well with ajax
[22:14:19] <Cork> Shazer[2]: when the event happens in the page
[22:14:31] <Shazer[2]> Err
[22:14:34] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you 1) post the data to the server through $.post or $.ajax
[22:14:34] <Shazer[2]> I don't know then
[22:14:35] <Shazer[2]> :(
[22:14:43] <Shazer[2]> Idk
[22:14:48] <pvel> http://jsfiddle.net/KXWrY/.......see this example here am did menu bar with sub menu bar link............here i want whenever am click tutorial link to  show sub menu bar link master menu link itself.....
[22:14:58] <DreamHazard> I've gotten to a stage where clicking any of the buttons loads all of the divs in quick succession
[22:15:02] <Cork> Shazer[2]: 2) the server handles the posted data
[22:15:23] <Cork> Shazer[2]: 3) the server echos the data that should be sent back to the page
[22:15:38] <Cork> Shazer[2]: that data ends up in the success callback function
[22:15:47] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, you need to post your code to jsfiddle.net. It's a great sandbox for learning this kind of thing
[22:15:55] <Cork> Shazer[2]: from there you do normal dom manipulation
[22:16:09] <Shazer[2]> Hmm.
[22:16:13] <pvel> http://jsfiddle.net/KXWrY/     see this example here ............i am did menu bar with sub menu bar link............here i want whenever am click tutorial link to show sub menu bar link  in master menu link itself..... its possible in jquery
[22:16:25] <theBrettman> Shazer[2], http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/WHNDs/
[22:16:28] <Shazer[2]> so I have index.php which posts a post variable
[22:16:31] <pvel> any 1 help me........am new for jquery
[22:16:44] <Shazer[2]> which needs to be processed in process.php without refreshing, right, Cork?
[22:16:46] <theBrettman> index.php does NOT post the var
[22:16:58] <theBrettman> your ajax() does
[22:17:03] <Whirl3d> pvel, I'm not understanding you, but I am afraid it's a language barrier
[22:17:04] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ja?
[22:17:11] <Whirl3d> right now you click tutorials and see the subment
[22:17:15] <Whirl3d> submenu*
[22:17:18] <Shazer[2]> Yeah
[22:17:20] <Cork> theBrettman: give him some breathing space
[22:17:22] <Whirl3d> but you want it to do what?
[22:17:23] <pvel> ya
[22:17:26] <theBrettman> if u have the page post it, u can't use the javascript
[22:17:38] <pvel> in same master menu itself
[22:17:41] <theBrettman> u can post with the page, but the javascript can't get the response then
[22:17:43] <Shazer[2]> HMM
[22:17:46] <theBrettman> that's what ajax() is for
[22:17:46] <Shazer[2]> Wait
[22:17:49] <Shazer[2]> stop
[22:17:49] <caniuse> Shazer[2]: http://i.imgur.com/XOUfd.png
[22:17:50] <Shazer[2]> please
[22:17:52] <Shazer[2]> You're losing me more
[22:17:59] <theBrettman> it communicates with the server instead of the page
[22:18:06] <Shazer[2]> ...
[22:18:06] <Shazer[2]> STOP
[22:18:07] <caniuse> Shazer[2]: http://i.imgur.com/XOUfd.png
[22:18:10] <theBrettman> ajax() will send it instead
[22:18:12] <Cork> ...
[22:18:14] <Shazer[2]> FFS
[22:18:24] <Cork> theBrettman, caniuse: give it a break
[22:18:25] <theBrettman> just look at the fiddle I made u
[22:18:33] <Shazer[2]> Thanks for helping theBrettman, but I think Cork can help more
[22:18:45] <Shazer[2]> Cork, so I'm not technically posting from index.php
[22:18:45] <Shazer[2]> but
[22:18:54] <Shazer[2]> what do I send as "data: " to process.php?
[22:18:54] <Cork> theBrettman: hes lose enough that code doesn't help
[22:19:10] <theBrettman> just trying to help u understand
[22:19:19] <theBrettman> data is ur vars
[22:19:25] <Cork> Shazer[2]: data is the data you want to have access to in the php $_POST variable
[22:19:49] <Shazer[2]> ok
[22:19:55] <theBrettman> like in my example. u alread have the form fields as data (including the submit button) lol
[22:20:12] <theBrettman> and u can include extra in ajax() if u want
[22:20:18] <Cork> theBrettman: if you get really lost code doesn't help
[22:20:28] <Cork> so just cool it and let him take it in
[22:20:39] <theBrettman> well I included comments with my fiddle
[22:20:50] <theBrettman> did u see? it's pretty explanatory
[22:20:57] <theBrettman> and kind of simple
[22:21:08] <theBrettman> and showed him a cpl options he might use
[22:21:19] <theBrettman> all of those options r optional
[22:21:49] <theBrettman> if u include action and method in your form attributes, u don't need anything else
[22:22:05] <theBrettman> unless u want to do something with the response
[22:23:01] <theBrettman> whew that soup was spicy!
[22:23:17] <Cork> theBrettman: learn when less is more
[22:23:38] <theBrettman> that was less, lol
[22:23:43] <Shazer[2]> Cork: data: 'todoText, todo',
[22:23:46] <Shazer[2]> does that look right?
[22:23:49] <theBrettman> hey, this isn't the css room, lol jk
[22:23:58] <Cork> Shazer[2]: sure
[22:24:03] <Shazer[2]> Will that get the $_POST['todoText']?
[22:24:10] <Cork> no
[22:24:19] <Shazer[2]> What will?
[22:24:22] <Cork> oh sorry no thats not corerct at all
[22:24:27] <theBrettman> shazer, if u don't wanna use data: u can just put it in a hidden form field also like my example
[22:24:39] <Cork> Shazer[2]: data: { todoText: 'todo' }
[22:24:55] <Cork> will be $_POST['todoText'] === 'todo'
[22:24:59] <Shazer[2]> Well..
[22:25:02] <Shazer[2]> That's not what I want..
[22:25:05] <theBrettman> data: {  var1: 'value1', var2: 'value2'}
[22:25:13] <Cork> Shazer[2]: what do you want?
[22:25:18] <theBrettman> that's cool. that's y u got options, lol
[22:25:27] <Shazer[2]> I just want to post whatever value get's posted as $_POST
[22:25:52] <theBrettman> ah, I get u
[22:26:02] <theBrettman> he just wants to submit the form
[22:26:05] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you don't get data from the server to the client through $_POST
[22:26:34] <theBrettman> it will automatically get the data for u
[22:26:36] <Cork> Shazer[2]: what you want to get to the client you echo out in the "php page"
[22:26:37] <theBrettman> from the form fields
[22:26:44] <theBrettman> u don't have to do anything special for that
[22:27:06] <Shazer[2]> :(
[22:27:08] <theBrettman> I don't think that's what he means, Cork
[22:27:08] <Shazer[2]> I can't explain my problem.
[22:27:15] <Shazer[2]> I speak fluent English, but it's so hard to explain.
[22:27:17] <Shazer[2]> :(
[22:27:26] <theBrettman> he just doesn't understand how ajax() works
[22:27:35] <theBrettman> it submits the form like it normally would
[22:27:37] <Shazer[2]> All I want to do, is post data from index.php with the js and then process that posted data in process.php
[22:28:02] <theBrettman> ok, u don't need javascript for that
[22:28:19] <theBrettman> unless u don't want the page to load
[22:28:21] <theBrettman> nvm, lol
[22:28:22] <Shazer[2]> ^^
[22:28:23] <Cork> theBrettman: have you made it your gole to make this as hard as posible?
[22:28:25] <Shazer[2]> The exact reason.
[22:28:50] <theBrettman> if u include action and method attributes in your form tag...
[22:28:56] <Shazer[2]> theBrettman
[22:28:57] <Shazer[2]> ...
[22:29:02] <Shazer[2]> I don't want it to refresh..
[22:29:03] <theBrettman> then all u need is $('form').ajax();
[22:29:03] <Whirl3d> ignore if you are having problems
[22:29:12] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/gjxPs/1/
[22:29:16] <aqeel> what is wwrong/
[22:29:24] <Cork> Shazer[2]: if you have a variable in js thats say var todoText = 'something';
[22:29:30] <Shazer[2]> Cork, no.
[22:29:43] <Cork> ok, so you want js to request data from php?
[22:29:52] <Cork> and php to send it back to js?
[22:30:19] <tw2113> sounds like ajax *dun dun dun*
[22:30:24] <Shazer[2]> Let's say I have a textbox on index.php on? Now, in JS if I press enter it get's the content of the textbox in index.php
[22:30:33] <Shazer[2]> Then in the JS it sends that content to process.php does the processing
[22:30:35] <Cork> Shazer[2]: stop
[22:30:41] <Cork> you don't have a textbox in php
[22:30:45] <Shazer[2]> HTML
[22:30:53] <Whirl3d> aqeel, it's hard to tell without some html to understand context
[22:30:54] <theBrettman> lol
[22:31:09] <pvel> @whirl3d.............did u find the solution
[22:31:09] <Whirl3d> do you only have one "indexID" element
[22:31:15] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ok and when you get the content of the textarea to php what should happen?
[22:31:24] <aqeel> its variable
[22:31:32] <aqeel> and yes individual
[22:31:35] <tw2113> Cork it should riverdance
[22:31:35] <Whirl3d> pvel, I am sorry, seriously, but I don't get what you mean by "the exact same menu"
[22:31:36] <Shazer[2]> insert into db, Cork.
[22:31:40] <theBrettman> if you don't need a response from the processing script, all u need is $('form').ajax();
[22:31:49] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ok, and then?
[22:31:58] <Shazer[2]> nothing?
[22:32:04] <theBrettman> but most people want to at least know that it sent successfully and return a message that it did
[22:32:09] <Whirl3d> you want to use .on on the parent of all of your elements that you are listening for the event
[22:32:13] <pvel> to display main menu itself
[22:32:21] <theBrettman> that's where u use the success option
[22:32:26] <pvel> like swing the other links
[22:32:40] <Cork> Shazer[2]: then $.post(url, { todoText: $('textarea').val() }); is all you need
[22:32:52] <aqeel> well u see my hover is perfect just converting it over to use on()
[22:32:54] <Cork> that will set $_POST['todoText'] to the content of the textarea
[22:33:00] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/7R4wS/1/
[22:33:06] <thirdknife> how to get text inside an anchor tag
[22:33:07] <pvel> @whirl3d.........exactly
[22:33:12] <aqeel> the variables stay put
[22:33:22] <Whirl3d> but that's for every element. You just want to do it for the thing that holds all those elements and do it once
[22:33:29] <theBrettman> why would he need to do that, Cork ?
[22:33:50] <Shazer[2]> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GSxcc/
[22:34:19] <Whirl3d> so, you have a #detail button a #contact button, a #cydia button, etc. inside of a div of class ".menuClass" for example.
[22:34:24] <Cork> Shazer[2]: yup
[22:34:29] <Shazer[2]> Then Cork
[22:34:31] <aqeel> yes
[22:34:33] <Shazer[2]> How do I send a hidden value/
[22:34:35] <Shazer[2]> ?*
[22:34:40] <thirdknife> how to get text inside an anchor tag
[22:34:52] <Cork> Shazer[2]: do you want to submit a complete form?
[22:34:57] <Shazer[2]> Cork no.
[22:35:00] <thirdknife> i have got the object
[22:35:03] <Shazer[2]> Just I want to get know
[22:35:07] <Cork> then just add it to the data object
[22:35:08] <Shazer[2]> How to get the hidden post variable?
[22:35:12] <Shazer[2]> And send it to process.php from JS?
[22:35:13] <gnarf> thirdknife: see ?text
[22:35:14] <bot-t> thirdknife, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[22:35:16] <theBrettman> $('#hidden-field').val();
[22:35:18] <thirdknife> if i call obj.val() shows error?
[22:35:33] <Cork> Shazer[2]: like data: { todoText: content, hidden: 'something else }
[22:35:39] <Cork> Shazer[2]: * like data: { todoText: content, hidden: 'something else' }
[22:35:43] <Shazer[2]> I GOT IT CORK
[22:35:44] <Shazer[2]> Yay
[22:35:46] <thirdknife> or for text is the same
[22:35:48] <Whirl3d> then you would do $(".menuClass").on({"mouseenter",function (e) { var btn=$(e.target); do something to btn}, "mouseleave":function (e) {var btn=$(e).target; do something to btn}});
[22:35:48] <Shazer[2]> Thanks so much.
[22:35:49] <Shazer[2]> :)
[22:35:54] <Cork> np
[22:35:57] <gnarf> thirdknife: .val() is for <input> and <textarea> etc
[22:35:59] <gnarf> thigs with "values"
[22:36:40] <gnarf> form elements
[22:37:42] <theBrettman> I guess he was talking about preprocessing the code with javascript the whole time, lol
[22:38:24] <thirdknife> gnarf, look at this http://chopapp.com/#qgfqfnaf
[22:38:36] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d, I got that up on jsfiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/7R4wS/1/
[22:39:19] <thirdknife> at line 11
[22:39:48] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, gimme a minute to look at what you got there
[22:39:56] <DreamHazard> sure
[22:40:03] <gnarf> thirdknife: use .eq() instead of .get()
[22:40:05] <gnarf> ?eq
[22:40:05] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[22:40:06] <gnarf> ?get
[22:40:06] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[22:40:22] <thirdknife> k
[22:40:23] <gnarf> .get() returns a DOMElement, .eq() returns a jQuery
[22:40:23] <Shazer[2]> Another question Cork
[22:40:27] <gnarf> otherwise similar
[22:40:29] <Shazer[2]> How do I get the value of a $_GET in JS?
[22:41:02] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you mean from php to js?
[22:41:13] <Shazer[2]> Yes Cork.
[22:41:19] <thirdknife> gnarf, yeah worked fine thanks
[22:41:24] <Cork> you echo it in the response
[22:41:51] <Cork> Shazer[2]: <?php echo 'this is the response'; ?>
[22:41:53] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, I want you to go through your code and anywhere you see  id="something" twice, you are wrong. Fix it first
[22:41:55] <Shazer[2]> NO...
[22:41:56] <Shazer[2]> No*
[22:41:58] <Shazer[2]> I mean
[22:42:08] <Shazer[2]> How do I check what the $_GET['gid'] is?
[22:42:17] <Whirl3d> so you can't have id="des" on both the button and the popup, it just will never work
[22:42:18] <Cork> in js?
[22:42:21] <Shazer[2]> how do I post the $_GET value or whatever
[22:42:21] <Shazer[2]> yes
[22:42:23] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d, ok
[22:42:25] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you can't
[22:42:26] <aqeel> well i have to get to the bottom of the understanding of this on() first.......giving me unsuspected results
[22:42:28] <Shazer[2]> URGH
[22:42:40] <aqeel> thanks
[22:42:42] <Cork> Shazer[2]: $_GET is server side, js knows nothing about it
[22:42:46] <aqeel> for all the great help
[22:43:20] <Shazer[2]> How does it know about post cork?
[22:43:28] <Shazer[2]> Like I can get the value of a textbox
[22:43:35] <Shazer[2]> how can I get the value of the get
[22:43:37] <Cork> Shazer[2]: is the $_GET for the ajax call or for the page load?
[22:43:46] <Shazer[2]> page load?
[22:44:02] <Cork> as in is it in the url for the page with the form
[22:44:23] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: parse window.location ?
[22:44:26] <gnarf> ?mdc location
[22:44:27] <bot-t> gnarf, window.location - MDN - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[22:44:30] * Cork nods
[22:44:51] <Cork> or you can actually use window.location.query
[22:45:32] <Shazer[2]> Cork
[22:45:35] <Shazer[2]> You know how i do
[22:45:40] <Shazer[2]> $('#todoText').val();
[22:45:45] <Shazer[2]> can I do that with getting the $_GET?
[22:45:46] <Cork> yup
[22:45:50] <Cork> sure
[22:45:58] <Cork> use $.get instead of $.post
[22:46:14] <Cork> or with $.ajax type: 'get'
[22:46:33] <Shazer[2]> o.O
[22:46:41] <Shazer[2]> Another problem I can't explain...
[22:46:42] <Cork> thats what those mean :)
[22:46:45] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: a) its not a $_GET -- its a "query string" on the browser side - you're totally using confusing terminology
[22:47:00] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, what does "col" mean in plain english? Is it short for "column" or "collection" or something else or did you just pic 3 letters.
[22:47:07] <Shazer[2]> Seeing as now I can only post if the gid is set
[22:47:13] <Shazer[2]> (gid = $_GET['gid'])
[22:47:16] <gnarf> there are multiple tiny functions to parse query strings including but not limited to ben almans BBQ
[22:47:30] <Shazer[2]> so, I need to post the value of $_GET['gid'] to process.php, Cork.
[22:47:36] <DreamHazard> short for column
[22:47:38] <Cork> Shazer[2]: where do you have $_GET['gid'] ?
[22:47:51] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ah, you mean you need get AND post at the same time?
[22:47:53] <Shazer[2]> In index.php?
[22:47:59] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: if the current url of the page is something like omgmypage.php?gid=10
[22:48:05] <Shazer[2]> Yeah like, I Need to post to process.php what $_GET['gid'] equals
[22:48:16] <Shazer[2]> so if it is
[22:48:20] <Cork> Shazer[2]: then you need to do some manual labor
[22:48:27] <Shazer[2]> ?gid=1 Cork, I need to post 1 to process.php
[22:48:28] <bot-t> Shazer[2], Couldn't find "gid=1 Cork, I need to post 1 to process.php" in jQuery Docs.
[22:48:32] <Cork> you need to add it to the url part of the ajax post yourself
[22:48:49] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/7R4wS/4/ should be cleaned up now
[22:49:32] <Cork> Shazer[2]: url: 'process.php?' + $.params({ cid: <your gid number> }),
[22:49:58] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, so when I click on "about" you want whcih content to be displayed?
[22:50:00] <Cork> Shazer[2]: sorry its $.param not $.params
[22:50:02] <Shazer[2]> BUT HOW DO I KNOW THE GID NUMBER?
[22:50:04] <Shazer[2]> Sorry for caps.
[22:50:17] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: is it in the browser url?
[22:50:20] <Cork> Shazer[2]: you have to echo it from the server side into js or the html
[22:50:24] <Shazer[2]> Yes gnarf.
[22:50:29] <DreamHazard> that's just a placeholder link for the moment. It's the "more" buttons I'm working with at the moment
[22:50:32] <Cork> from where ever you have it
[22:50:38] <Shazer[2]> jQuery is so dificult
[22:50:48] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: you are difficult, jQuery is easy ;)
[22:50:52] <Whirl3d> so the more buttons aren't even showing up on my screen. Where do they show up?
[22:51:05] <Shazer[2]> gnarf: true.
[22:51:10] <Cork> Shazer[2]: if your current url is say index.php?cid=1; you can do window.location.query and it will have it
[22:51:13] <DreamHazard> under the three columns halfway down the page
[22:51:19] <Shazer[2]> Cork ok
[22:51:25] <Shazer[2]> so just window.location.query?
[22:51:25] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: if your url is "http://something.com/index.php?gid=1" -- window.location.search (not query) will contain it
[22:51:30] <Whirl3d> sorry, I had scrolling turned off for another project, all better now
[22:51:30] <Cork> yes
[22:51:35] <Cork> ouch
[22:51:38] <gnarf> window.location.search === "?gid=1"
[22:51:42] <Cork> Shazer[2]: what gnarf said
[22:51:45] <DreamHazard> Dsapien ac dolor mattis placeratn, Something Else, and Another Thing
[22:51:48] <Shazer[2]> BUT I DON'T KNOW THE GID
[22:51:50] <Shazer[2]> Sorry.
[22:51:54] <Shazer[2]> It could be something other than 1.
[22:52:03] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: fucking read
[22:52:11] <Cork> Shazer[2]: if its in the url, then that command will have it
[22:52:14] <Shazer[2]> I am.
[22:52:21] <Shazer[2]> Oh I get it.
[22:52:22] <Shazer[2]> Nevermind.
[22:52:24] <theBrettman> oh cool, there's a wrapInner() func. I was wondering how I was gonna do that!
[22:52:26] <Shazer[2]> I thought you meant I had to specify it.
[22:52:33] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: window.location.search is equal to whatever the browsers URL has in the "search query" portion
[22:52:39] <theBrettman> makes life easier! ahhh...
[22:53:05] <Shazer[2]> Ok sorry
[22:53:16] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: if you need to parse that number out of that string, you can use some simple regexps, or a library that does it - jQuery doesn't really have any builtin stuff
[22:53:17] <gnarf> ?deparam
[22:53:18] <bot-t> gnarf, #6834 ($.ajax doesn't uri encode a string input automatically ... - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6834

[22:53:26] <bot-t> gnarf, Ben Alman » jQuery BBQ » Examples » jQuery.deparam - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/deparam/

[22:53:35] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[22:53:59] <Shazer[2]> gnarf, my line looks like, gid: window.location.search
[22:54:06] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: thats wrong
[22:54:16] <Shazer[2]> then in process.php.. $gid = $_POST['gid'];
[22:54:20] <Shazer[2]> Why gnarf?
[22:54:22] <Shazer[2]> ?why is it wrong
[22:54:24] <gnarf> that will probably pass "?gid=1"
[22:54:26] <bot-t> Shazer[2], #1514 (animate() has 4 params but why is it being called with only 3 ... - Opened 5 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1514
[22:54:28] <Shazer[2]> Yes, and?
[22:54:37] <Shazer[2]> lol
[22:54:48] <Shazer[2]> OH
[22:54:50] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: i assume you just wanted the number?
[22:54:54] <Shazer[2]> Yeah correct.
[22:54:55] <Shazer[2]> My bad.
[22:55:08] <gnarf> if you make the URL of the ajax be "process.php" + window.location.search
[22:55:25] <gnarf> then the request is process.php?gid=1 which, $_GET["gid"] will be 1
[22:55:30] <gnarf> just like your other pages
[22:55:37] <gnarf> its not going to be sent in the "post data"
[22:56:07] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, here is what you need to do:
[22:56:35] <Whirl3d> You setup a popup container and background container with id="popupContainer" and id="bgContainer"
[22:56:45] <Whirl3d> You only have one of each
[22:56:53] <Cork> Shazer[2]: alternativly you can set the id from php inline when index.php loads
[22:57:05] <Shazer[2]> I don't know.
[22:57:06] <Shazer[2]> I'm lost now.
[22:57:08] <gnarf> Cork: boo
[22:57:23] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d, ok
[22:57:24] <Whirl3d> then your script will say, "when a more button is clicked, copy my content into the one and only popup window and then show the popup window"
[22:57:35] <gnarf> Cork: mixing php inside your js is always a bad idea
[22:57:35] <Cork> Shazer[2]: like url: ' process.php?gid=<?php echo $_GET['cid']; ?>'
[22:57:41] <DreamHazard> right
[22:57:43] <Shazer[2]> I don't know..
[22:57:44] <Shazer[2]> I'm screwed
[22:57:47] <Shazer[2]> My mind is fucked
[22:57:49] <Shazer[2]> RIght now
[22:57:52] <Cork> gnarf: not always
[22:57:56] <gnarf> Cork: ALWAYS
[22:58:07] <Cork> gnarf: sometimes you can't relay on whats in the url
[22:58:38] <gnarf> Cork: then use HTML -- <input type="hidden" name="gid" value="<?= $_GET["gid"] ?>">
[22:58:49] <gnarf> or something similar
[22:58:52] <gnarf> and find it in the js
[22:59:03] <Shazer[2]> I'll never succeed, I can't even get this basic shit.
[22:59:05] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: okay so like do you understand how a url is constructed?
[22:59:09] <Cork> gnarf: i would prefer to set a js variable if only js needs it
[22:59:19] <gnarf> Cork: you would prefer to be wrong ;)
[22:59:28] <Cork> lol
[22:59:50] <gnarf> Cork: its just bad practice - you can't minify that shit - nor store it in an external js - and really you shouldn't have any "inline scripts" in your html
[23:00:37] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: did you read that link on the location object
[23:00:37] <Shazer[2]> gnarf: yes.
[23:00:39] <Cork> gnarf: adding lonly <input type="hidden"> around in your html just to store values is just as bad
[23:00:40] <gnarf> ?mdc location
[23:00:41] <bot-t> gnarf, window.location - MDN - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[23:00:52] <gnarf> Cork: why?
[23:01:01] <Shazer[2]> I just can't understand this....
[23:01:01] <Shazer[2]> :(
[23:01:27] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: ask a question about what you don't understand
[23:01:44] <Cork> cause firstly you would have to do dom traversal to find the value; and if you arn't going to use ajax or similar, its kinde weird
[23:01:56] <Shazer[2]> gnarf: do you think you'd mind if I ask your personally?
[23:01:56] <Cork> *kinda
[23:01:57] <Shazer[2]> Via PM?
[23:02:15] <gnarf> Cork: a) if you give that hidden an id - traversal is trivial
[23:02:18] <Shazer[2]> So I can just type the whole idea I have
[23:02:29] <gnarf> b) if you aren't going to use ajax, how do you plan on passing the gid anyway?
[23:02:42] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: id prefer you kept it in the channel
[23:02:57] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: is there a <form> tag to make this thing work without ajax?
[23:03:13] <Shazer[2]> Yes of course.
[23:03:24] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: because if the <form action="process.php?gid=<?= $_GET["gid"]?>" method="post">
[23:03:33] <gnarf> then you can traverse up to the form and use its "action" url
[23:03:43] <gnarf> for the actual ajax request
[23:04:06] <Shazer[2]> gnarf: I'm just going to typ what I want to achieve
[23:04:15] <Shazer[2]> Because, right now I'm not taking anything in.
[23:04:37] <gnarf> overthinking? :)
[23:05:03] <Cork> Shazer[2]: maybe you should take a break and get back with fresh eyes and mind
[23:05:28] <Shazer[2]> I don't know..
[23:07:38] <Shazer[2]> Cork, gnarf: I have index.php, if $_GET['gid'] is set then process with js to process.php and then for the success callback add to the list on my UI
[23:07:56] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: we get that much
[23:08:42] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: so your big problem right now is that the $_GET['gid'] isn't getting set on the ajax request, because the url is just "process.php" when it should be "process.php?gid=____"
[23:09:02] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: which is why i asked if you had a <form> element on the page that had the proper url with the "gid" param on it
[23:09:18] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: or an <input type="hidden" name="gid"> with the proper value
[23:09:20] <gnarf> either will work
[23:09:27] <gnarf> and you can easily find these using jQuery
[23:10:13] <gnarf> <form id="myForm" action="process.php?gid=<?=$_GET["gid"]?>"> --- $("#myForm").attr("action") <--- the URL you want to use for your ajax
[23:11:01] <gnarf> <input type="hidden" name="gid" value="<?=$_GET["gid"] ?>" id="myGid"> --- "process.php?gid=" + $("#myGid").val() <--- the URL
[23:11:57] <gnarf> think of an AJAX request a little like a form submission - only it doesn't "navigate" to that page - it calls your success with the returned data
[23:12:30] <Shazer[2]> no
[23:12:40] <Shazer[2]> process.php has nothing to do with ?gid gnarf
[23:12:57] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: then how does it know what the gid is?
[23:13:05] <Shazer[2]> getting it from index.php?
[23:13:08] <Shazer[2]> index.php?gid=1
[23:13:10] <Shazer[2]> is an example URL
[23:13:13] <gnarf> sure
[23:13:16] <Shazer[2]> which is processed by js then process
[23:13:19] <Shazer[2]> and process get's the gid
[23:13:22] <gnarf> so - ignore the javascript entirely right now
[23:13:27] <gnarf> how does the app work without js
[23:13:41] <gnarf> there is a form, you click submit and it adds something?
[23:13:54] <gnarf> how does it pass gid along to process.php ?
[23:15:10] <gnarf> you either a) need to pass gid as a "get parameter" aka "search query" in the <form>'s action - or b) pass the gid as a hidden in the post data right?
[23:15:40] <gnarf> c) use a cookie/session variable
[23:15:54] <gnarf> c is probably the buggiest of them so i don't suggest that method
[23:16:10] <Shazer[2]> Yeah gnarf.
[23:16:14] <Shazer[2]> Without ajax, I can do this easily.
[23:16:18] <Shazer[2]> But I don't want to refresh.
[23:16:20] <Whirl3d> ?.closest
[23:16:21] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[23:16:29] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: so how >would< you do it without the ajax?
[23:16:37] <Shazer[2]> well..
[23:16:44] <Shazer[2]> in process.php just do
[23:17:00] <Shazer[2]> Just send a hidden value (of gid) to process php
[23:17:02] <Shazer[2]> and handle from there
[23:17:05] <gnarf> okay
[23:17:29] <gnarf> so that means you have an <input type="hidden" name="gid" value="<?php echo $_GET["gid"] ?>"> in your form
[23:17:31] <gnarf> right?
[23:18:13] <theBrettman> there should be a replaceClass() function
[23:18:20] <gnarf> you can get the value of that input the same way you get the value of the text box -- add an id to that hidden input and select it with jQuery and call .val()
[23:18:21] <Shazer[2]> correct.
[23:18:32] <theBrettman> that way u can switch classes
[23:18:38] <theBrettman> without two func calls
[23:18:40] <gnarf> theBrettman: see ?toggleClass
[23:18:41] <bot-t> theBrettman, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[23:18:47] <theBrettman> ohhh
[23:18:49] <theBrettman> ok
[23:18:51] <theBrettman> cool
[23:19:03] <gnarf> .toggleClass("class1 class2") will switch between them assuming it has only one to begin with
[23:19:26] <theBrettman> class 1 is the one replaced, right?
[23:19:45] <gnarf> theBrettman: or the one added - order is insignificant
[23:20:14] <theBrettman> ahhh, that's sweet
[23:20:16] <gnarf> theBrettman: if it has "class1" it removes it otherwise adds it, if it has "class2" it removes it, otherwise adds it
[23:20:38] <gnarf> so if it started with class1 and not class2 - after it will have only class2
[23:20:59] <Shazer[2]> I got it gnarf.
[23:21:02] <Shazer[2]> Why was that so hard..
[23:21:03] <Shazer[2]> :(
[23:21:41] <gnarf> Shazer[2]: cuz you're new to async programming / JS / jQuery / HTTP / HTML / PHP ?
[23:21:58] <Shazer[2]> Probably
[23:23:30] <gnarf> anyway, glad you got the idea down - hope you can make it all work
[23:23:35] <gnarf> im out for the night
[23:23:38] <gnarf> ?glwt
[23:23:39] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com
[23:23:42] <Whirl3d> DreamHazard, I'm almost done.
[23:23:58] <DreamHazard> I got a bunch of empty divs coming up at me
[23:24:03] <mindis|wurk> sup guys. is there any standard way to force a proper refresh for a page that destroys all dynamic elements created previously etc.?
[23:24:16] <gnarf> mindis|wurk: location = location;
[23:24:48] <mindis|wurk> errrrmmmm...how does that work exactly?
[23:25:05] <gnarf> mindis|wurk: tells the browser to navigate to the same URL it is currently on
[23:25:09] <DreamHazard> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/7R4wS/6/
[23:25:24] <mindis|wurk> what i had in mind was something to happen when user presses f5 or click refresh in his browser
[23:25:41] <gnarf> location.reload() is about the same
[23:26:25] <mindis|wurk> because right now if f5 is pressed at least firefox messes up the dynamic stuff with the elements that were originally on the page on creation
[23:27:02] <theBrettman> damn, wrapInner() wrapped my submenu too. I just wanted to wrap the text node...
[23:27:03] <theBrettman> ugh
[23:27:03] <gnarf> mindis|wurk: misintrepted your statement - sounded like you wanted to force a reload
[23:28:20] <gnarf> theBrettman: jQuery is designed to work on Elements (a specific type of node) - not all nodes
[23:28:24] <theBrettman> how do I get just the text node?
[23:28:29] <theBrettman> I forget...
[23:28:33] <gnarf> text nodes are dangerously unsupported
[23:28:45] <gnarf> but if you want to live on the wild side - see ?contents
[23:28:46] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[23:29:08] <theBrettman> contents gets everything
[23:29:18] <gnarf> yup
[23:29:25] <theBrettman> I need just text node
[23:29:30] <gnarf> see ?.filter
[23:29:30] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[23:30:01] <gnarf> .contents().filter( function() { return this.nodeType == {whatever it is for a textnode} });
[23:30:15] <theBrettman> I could use children() too
[23:30:24] <theBrettman> it's the pseudo selector thing I need
[23:30:40] <gnarf> define "text node" please
[23:30:51] <mindis|wurk> webdev sure is a good way to increase blood pressure
[23:31:14] <theBrettman> text node is text inside of a tag
[23:31:35] <theBrettman> or between the tag start and end
[23:31:45] <gnarf> okay
[23:31:49] <gnarf> we are talking bout the same thing
[23:31:56] <gnarf> how would chilldren() help?
[23:31:57] <theBrettman> is there a pseudo selector for it?
[23:32:04] <gnarf> a) css can NEVER target non elements
[23:32:06] <theBrettman> cuz it works the same as filter()
[23:32:22] <gnarf> children() returns elements
[23:32:31] <gnarf> conents() returns all nodes
[23:32:56] <theBrettman> it can get nodes
[23:33:00] <theBrettman> I need the text node
[23:33:19] <gnarf> contents() will give you all the nodes - .filter() it to only text ones
[23:33:29] <theBrettman> I have a ul.menu
[23:33:57] <theBrettman> it has li and some of the li contain text and ul.submenu
[23:34:19] <gnarf> theBrettman: suggestion - wrap the text in a <span>
[23:34:21] <theBrettman> I want to wrapInner()
[23:34:24] <theBrettman> on a li
[23:34:28] <gnarf> in the html
[23:34:32] <theBrettman> the script will
[23:34:36] <gnarf> save yourself a ton of headache
[23:34:55] <theBrettman> but I'm trying to do it the right way cuz it's for ui-menu
[23:35:04] <gnarf> .contents().filter( function() { return this.nodeType == 3; })
[23:35:14] <theBrettman> right now, ui-menu isn't finished
[23:35:14] <gnarf> that will give you a jQuery of the textnodes
[23:35:19] <theBrettman> so it doesn't do that for u
[23:35:31] <theBrettman> thx
[23:35:32] <gnarf> theBrettman: menu is pretty darn polished
[23:35:38] <theBrettman> huh?
[23:35:43] <theBrettman> not what I found. it's not even close
[23:35:52] <mindis|wurk> hmph. i see my problem is exclusive to firefox, even IE9 doesn't fuck this up. gg mozilla
[23:35:56] <theBrettman> how the heck do u add submenu's to it?
[23:36:13] <theBrettman> it doesn't have submenu support yet or icon support
[23:36:22] <theBrettman> or I wouldn't have to do all this
[23:36:24] <gnarf> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/menu/navigationmenu.html
[23:36:47] <theBrettman> but I got it straight from git?
[23:36:56] <gnarf> that is also - straight from git
[23:37:08] <gnarf> i know this shit works
[23:37:23] <gnarf> cuz i spent 2 hours debugging the mouse/key events with kborchers who was working on it
[23:37:42] <theBrettman> that's weird. cuz I joined the project cuz I need it and what they have is missing all that
[23:37:53] <theBrettman> let me show u a link
[23:38:20] <theBrettman> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9m2/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[23:38:27] <theBrettman> milestone 2
[23:38:32] <gnarf> thats the 1.9 milestone 2 tag
[23:38:39] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.menu.js
[23:38:42] <gnarf> thats the newest
[23:38:55] <theBrettman> damn. I spent days on this
[23:38:58] <theBrettman> grr
[23:39:12] <theBrettman> they really need to organize stuff better. this was all I could find
[23:39:23] <gnarf> theBrettman: "master" is the 1.9 branch
[23:39:25] <theBrettman> so I go under master?
[23:39:27] <theBrettman> ah
[23:39:38] <gnarf> theBrettman: "1.8-stable" is the stable branch
[23:39:52] <theBrettman> but how good is 1.9 menu?
[23:40:00] <theBrettman> oops, I mean 1.8
[23:40:06] <gnarf> 1.8 doesn't have menu
[23:40:08] <gnarf> its new
[23:40:13] <theBrettman> I didn't think it did
[23:40:15] <theBrettman> ok
[23:40:22] <theBrettman> wow... all this work for nothin, lol
[23:40:26] <theBrettman> ohwell, glad that's over
[23:40:38] <Xotix> Is there something like a paste event on chrome?
[23:40:40] <theBrettman> I was about to ditch ui for extjs
[23:40:42] <theBrettman> lol
[23:40:45] <gnarf> theBrettman: might want to check with the team in #jqueryui-dev
[23:40:59] <gnarf> theBrettman: before trying to work on something that probably already has a person assigned to it
[23:41:00] <gnarf> ;)
[23:41:16] <theBrettman> yeah, they need better ways to find that info out
[23:41:29] <gnarf> theBrettman: better than talking with the team?
[23:41:39] <gnarf> its like 6 or 10 active devs
[23:41:45] <theBrettman> how do u figure out how to talk to the team in the first place?
[23:41:49] <Xotix> extjs won't get supported in the future i think
[23:41:51] <gnarf> we meet every wednesday

[23:42:21] <theBrettman> what r u talkin about, Xotix?
[23:42:34] <gnarf> theBrettman: ask in #jquery and one of these people would tell you the same :)
[23:42:53] <theBrettman> yes but someone who doesn't know about irc wouldn't know
[23:42:57] <theBrettman> it should be on the site
[23:43:04] <theBrettman> it does tell about irc on the site
[23:43:13] <theBrettman> but it should have the dev info on the dev site
[23:43:17] <theBrettman> and some projects do
[23:43:25] <theBrettman> they'll have a discussion page somewhere but not menu
[23:43:40] <gnarf> theBrettman: the developing jquery ui forum is not horrible either
[23:43:55] <theBrettman> and u can apply to join projects but u don't know how to communicate outside of comments on pages
[23:44:14] <theBrettman> well, glad u were here today
[23:44:18] <gnarf> im pretty sure scott & richard ( ui dev lead and ui team lead ) troll those forums often
[23:44:27] <theBrettman> u saved me hell
[23:44:34] <mindis|wurk> hmm, strange. $(".projectedit").on('click', '.save', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); doesn't seem to stop default events for me
[23:44:49] <bradhe> if I have to objects, how can I tell if they point at the same element? i.e. var one = $('div.something'); var two = $('div.something');
[23:44:50] <theBrettman> I'm gonna delete my comment on there so I don't look like an ass
[23:45:03] <gnarf> theBrettman: if you're interested in helping with the development of ui itself, you should lurk #jqueryui-dev and come to the meeting "today" at noon eastern
[23:45:09] <theBrettman> well, I already do to those who read it but not to everyone else in the future, lol
[23:45:36] <gnarf> theBrettman: also - if you see ajpiano talking - try talking to him about stuff too - he's kinda the recruiter ;)
[23:45:38] <theBrettman> I was starting to think the only  way to know what was going on was to look at all the branches on git
[23:46:08] <theBrettman> cool
[23:46:14] <gnarf> theBrettman: no prob - but i meant to be in bed SO long ago - gonna do that now
[23:46:19] <gnarf> hope to see ya at the meeting ;)
[23:46:24] <theBrettman> is there somewhere I can see what tasks r left?
[23:46:35] <theBrettman> k, gn
[23:47:07] <gnarf> theBrettman: meeting in like 9 hours should shed some light on that - or if you see people talking actively in ui-dev - ask them theren
[23:47:32] <theBrettman> ok
[23:47:42] <theBrettman> I wonder if they got the contextmenu support yet
[23:47:52] <theBrettman> that's what I wanted to help with
[23:48:10] <gnarf> theBrettman: also - talk to ajpiano about your "issues" with the information on the develop/team pages
[23:48:17] <theBrettman> I think they're working on it cuz there was a comment asking how to do it and that's when I tried to join but by the time I joined, the comment was gone
[23:48:20] <gnarf> he's the "developer relations" guy for the jQuery project
[23:48:27] <theBrettman> ok
[23:49:03] <gnarf> but srsly - /join #jqueryui-dev ;)
[23:49:09] <gnarf> lurk
[23:49:11] <gnarf> and listen
[23:49:26] <theBrettman> what's the room again?
[23:49:38] <theBrettman> it got buried, lol
[23:49:53] <gnarf> #jqueryui-dev
[23:50:28] <gnarf> zzZZzz - l8r
