[01:17:21] <cryptomonk> hello
[01:17:58] <cryptomonk> How do you get jquery to select the actual div clicked on?  when I try $("div.gradingScale").click(function(){  it always returns the first one found not the one that is actually clicked
[01:33:40] <bfig> hello, can somebody explain to me what this control is supposed to do when you override the setDate and formatDate? it seems to make recursive calls to itself... with the same parameters non stop (and that is what seems to be happening in my code too)
[01:33:49] <bfig> https://github.com/Prezent/jquery-weekpicker/blob/master/src/jquery.weekpicker.js
[01:34:25] <bfig> i have an example that works and an example that doesn't. I get stack overflow in the one that doesn't
[02:17:22] <bfig> anyone around here?
[02:49:13] <Cork> bfig: if you get recursion when you replace a function it is most likely cause you do something in your new function that calls back into the widget
[02:49:54] <bfig> Cork, it looks pretty recursive to me... but this surprisingly works for simple examples, so I dunno
[02:50:10] <bfig> in any case, found a different datepicker that works for me :)
[02:50:24] <Cork> bfig: i didn't say it wasn't a recursion, i just said it is most likely in your code not the core widget
[02:50:59] <bfig> the code is from a library I downloaded from the internet... my code is simply $("#picker").weekpicker()
[02:51:24] <Cork> ah, so you aren't the one overriding the function
[02:52:01] <Cork> well then i would guess it might be the extension plugin is expecting an olderversion of the plugin
[02:52:13] <Cork> haven't used the widget so not sure
[02:52:22] <bfig> ok, thanks for the feedback
[02:52:28] <bfig> :)
[03:46:23] <hellyeah> yo
[03:47:20] <hellyeah> anyone knows abouÄ±t this error http://jsfiddle.net/56fac9cu/
[03:48:29] <Cork> hellyeah: from what line?
[03:49:13] <Cork> hellyeah: the code you pasted is most likely not related to the error
[03:49:45] <hellyeah> jquery-2.1.3.min.js:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '355' in  it reported that in jquery files
[03:50:06] <Cork> that isn't the source of the error
[03:50:14] <Cork> what line in your code causes it?
[03:50:57] <hellyeah> i dont know it didnt report it
[03:51:04] <hellyeah> but when i commented out map
[03:51:09] <hellyeah> it didnt show me that error
[03:51:30] <Cork> what is in param1 then?
[03:51:48] <Cork> ah
[03:51:55] <Cork> your creating an array of jquery objects
[03:51:59] <Cork> append can't handle that
[03:52:10] <Cork> it handles either an array of dom elements, or a jquery object
[03:52:16] <Cork> not an array of jquery objects
[03:52:40] <Cork> simplest solution is to add [0] to return $button;
[03:52:48] <hellyeah> param1 is just one index of array
[03:52:56] <Cork> no it isn't
[03:53:04] <Cork> cause then you would try to loop an index
[03:53:26] <Cork> or rather if it was you would have quite broken code
[03:54:30] <hellyeah> param1 is just msg.d and msg.d is just json object
[03:54:40] <hellyeah> what should i do add[0] to the button
[03:54:41] <hellyeah> ?
[03:54:52] <Cork> so your looping a string?
[03:55:02] <Cork> or do you mean you loop an array/object?
[03:55:17] <hellyeah> i am looping array
[03:55:30] <Cork> ok, then the comment about $button is the answer
[03:56:20] <hellyeah> Cork: is it array right? https://jsfiddle.net/50kswthz/
[03:56:32] <Cork> yes
[03:56:38] <Cork> see the comment about $button
[03:56:57] <hellyeah> $button[0] you mean
[03:57:32] <hellyeah> ?
[03:58:10] <hellyeah> samer error agai
[03:58:23] <Cork> ok, then try to reproduce the error in the fiddle
[03:58:47] <hellyeah> sec
[04:04:21] <hellyeah> Cork: actually i dont know what it alerted error but i changed url part for making ajax call in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/56fac9cu/3/
[04:05:08] <hellyeah> why it alerted error it should work
[04:05:20] <Cork> hellyeah: that isn't related to your problem
[04:05:28] <Cork> the problem is most likely not related to the ajax call
[04:06:32] <hellyeah> success function should be executed
[04:08:10] <hellyeah> anyway
[04:08:17] <hellyeah> iwill need some fresh hair
[04:08:18] <hellyeah> br
[04:08:18] <hellyeah> b
[05:30:48] <hellyeah> param1 was a string i checked that thats why i used  method $.parseJSON is it a wise approach to do http://jsfiddle.net/L22us1s0/
[05:52:52] <daslicht> anyone got expericne with this:
[05:52:52] <daslicht> https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder/wiki/Integration-with-TinyMCE-4.x
[05:52:53] <daslicht> ?
[06:17:05] <daslicht> Ok I got it working stand alone :)
[06:17:16] <daslicht> next quest is to integrate it into grid editor
[06:17:18] <daslicht> https://gist.github.com/daslicht/740ad9e11ed248daea05#file-grideditor-elfinder-js-L33
[06:17:37] <daslicht> thats my approach but the File Browser Button is not shown in the insert image dialog :/
[07:14:34] <daslicht> heureka: http://5.45.104.102/dev/grid-editor/example/tinymce.html
[07:14:35] <daslicht> :D
[07:16:06] <timaaarrreee> ive made this online drawing app would be nice if people could try draw on it for testing purposes at https://udraw.me its using socket.io  cheers
[07:18:20] <daslicht> cool stuff!
[07:20:47] <timaaarrreee> any ui suggestions or bugs found would be much appreciated
[07:21:01] <rishi_> what addClass do
[07:21:46] <shoky> timaaarrreee: very nice. WSAD doesn't really work ;p  only W moves.. right
[07:22:04] <rishi_> please give me responce
[07:22:19] <shoky> timaaarrreee: and it could definitely use a zoom-in/out
[07:23:07] <shoky> and middle button doesn't seem to do anything
[07:23:21] <shoky> (chrome, windows)
[07:23:43] <shoky> rishi_: adds a class
[07:23:50] <shoky> or classes
[07:24:00] <shoky> `api addClass
[07:24:06] <shoky> ?api addClass
[07:24:06] <b-ot> we got dat
[07:24:13] <shoky> yer.
[07:25:41] <daslicht> :D
[07:27:01] <Rishi_> hellooo friends
[07:27:05] <timaaarrreee> shoky: hmm, damn im using a switch on the keyCode numbers which might not be great
[07:27:12] <taplar> kon'nichiwa
[07:28:35] <timaaarrreee> I have zoom in/out in the works writing a program in C to batch process the tiles to zoom out.
[07:29:02] <shoky> nice
[07:29:53] <timaaarrreee> CTRL  - in chrome might work as a 'hack' to zoom out.
[07:31:18] <timaaarrreee> oh an apolgies for the rude drawings, i had 46 CS students in my class on it.
[07:31:58] <shoky> i might've added one of those a few days ago when you posted in some other channel ;D
[07:33:09] <timaaarrreee> haha, I kinda want to try out HTTP2 with it but nodejs doesn't seem to have much in the way for that yet when using express.
[07:41:46] <Jesperhead> 'alo, have a relatively simple problem (i assume) but my lack of js and jquery is hindering my ability to solve it. I have an HTML page that gets a JSON object passed to it onLoad. Based on the contents of this JSON, certain portions of the page will be modified (buttons faded/disabled, etc).
[07:43:04] <Jesperhead> I have a number of if statements in my $(document).ready(function()) to set these attributes. I was able to successfully cause the fading of buttons with $("#object).css("opacity", "0.25"); but I cannot seem to disable/enable button control
[07:43:29] <Jesperhead> that is... onclick
[07:48:48] <RaceCondition> is Steve Newcomb still a member of the jQuery Foundation?
[07:50:55] <taplar> Jesperhead: got a fiddle?
[07:51:11] <Jesperhead> WIDDLYWIDDLYWIDDLY YEEEAAAAAA
[07:52:20] <Jesperhead> sorry. my name is a reference to a guitarist and the band he was once in. if there is some JS lingo im missing, sorry.
[07:52:35] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[07:52:45] <Jesperhead> oh! lol fiddle is sometimes slang for guitar
[07:52:47] <Jesperhead> haha
[07:53:11] <taplar> hardly the context of a jquery chatroom, :P
[07:53:38] <Jesperhead> i do not have a jsfiddle account
[07:54:33] <taplar> you can create one without one
[07:57:10] <Jesperhead> i wasnt aware of what the site did. got it now. I appreciate the willingness to help, but I can't share the code and to make a mock up would require a lotttt of editing
[07:57:57] <taplar> don't need the whole thing.  just a small example of the issue
[07:57:59] <RaceCondition> is there anybody here from the jQuery Foundation?
[08:03:39] <ul71m0> Hi i need to check if input has specific value and than based on that value i need to have action. Basically i need to check if input has "United States" in value. Here is my attempt but not working well. https://jsfiddle.net/e15fjknt/1/
[08:04:34] <taplar> ul71m0: https://jsfiddle.net/e15fjknt/2/
[08:05:34] <ul71m0> taplar: wow that was fast, thanks ;) let me test it now
[08:05:37] <ul71m0> taplar++
[08:06:21] <taplar> you were wanting where the value was in the element which is similar to a contains, which indexOf will do for you on a string
[08:07:15] <ul71m0> taplar: its working. Awesome :) thanks again
[08:07:46] <ul71m0> so indexOf checks for strings
[08:07:59] <taplar> yeah, it tries to find the first position that matches
[08:08:02] <ul71m0> .val is just to check if it exist
[08:08:05] <taplar> -1 being a non match
[08:08:19] <taplar> .val() gets the value of the input
[08:12:55] <hellyeah> hey
[08:13:21] <hellyeah> i want to get spesific part of array what am i doing here? Any suggestion?  http://jsfiddle.net/ep04bzv2/2/
[08:13:41] <taplar> which part?
[08:14:48] <hellyeah> if i understand correctly in this example "project_name":"ECourse" it is 0,"environment":"Prod"  it is 1,"frontend":"Monitor" it is 2. I want to get project_name:ECourse
[08:15:36] <taplar> uh
[08:15:39] <taplar> k is an array
[08:15:49] <taplar> so you reference each element with k[index]
[08:16:01] <taplar> then you access the object pieces with object notation
[08:16:02] <taplar> so
[08:16:12] <taplar> k[1].project_name would be valid
[08:16:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:17:07] <hellyeah> wht is it 1
[08:17:09] <hellyeah> ?
[08:17:41] <taplar> that's the index of the array, ranging from [0, size - 1]
[08:18:01] <hellyeah> yes
[08:27:17] <Jesperhead> ok how do i submit a fiddle?
[08:27:47] <taplar> you can run it with the run button up top.  to share it with others click the save/update up top and copy the new url
[08:28:06] <Jesperhead> http://jsfiddle.net/0t8bqnzr/
[08:29:45] <Jesperhead> none of the commented statements work
[08:30:21] <Jesperhead> sorry, the desired effect is to disable the button, that is, no JS function onClick
[08:30:39] <taplar> is that the actual format of that part of the json?
[08:30:58] <Jesperhead> basically. its a string pulled from a server
[08:31:04] <Jesperhead> (this is an android app_
[08:31:18] <Jesperhead> it gets passed in with a JavascriptInterface
[08:31:19] <taplar> right, but is it actually: "variable":"false"
[08:31:25] <taplar> or is it: "variable":false
[08:31:57] <taplar> because "false" is a string
[08:32:11] <taplar> so !json.variable would be falsy
[08:32:14] <Jesperhead> no. i used a bool to make the if statement clear. every variable is either a string, array, blank string, or the element simply isnt in the JSON object
[08:32:24] <Jesperhead> thanks, i didnt realize.
[08:32:36] <Jesperhead> but thats only in the example
[08:32:42] <taplar> k, so it does go into the logic
[08:33:18] <xec-> well, line 5 and 6 are commented "works" ;p
[08:33:52] <xec> Jesperhead: what are you trying to do with the next lines there? unbind an existing handler?
[08:34:06] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/0t8bqnzr/1/
[08:34:20] <taplar> changed the json so the if fires
[08:34:21] <Jesperhead> basically. the html defines the onClick JSFunction, i want to remove it in that block
[08:35:23] <xec> Jesperhead: ok so basically like this? http://jsfiddle.net/0t8bqnzr/3/
[08:35:55] <hellyeah> i have an array one column i need for something else
[08:36:06] <hellyeah> i want to exclude that column in certain operation
[08:36:12] <hellyeah> is that poossible to do that?
[08:36:17] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/0t8bqnzr/4/
[08:36:18] <xec> Jesperhead: you can set the onclick property of the DOM object to null
[08:36:48] <Jesperhead> taplar: testing
[08:37:08] <hellyeah> does my question make sense?
[08:37:21] <xec> Jesperhead: and since $('selector') returns jquery you could do $('selector').prop("onclick", null); or $('selector')[0].onclick = null;  or http://jsfiddle.net/0t8bqnzr/5/
[08:37:52] <Jesperhead> xec: thanks for your input, taplar's solution achieved my desired result
[08:37:52] <taplar> hellyeah: what do you mean exclude?
[08:38:01] <hellyeah> i am stringifying json array but i dont want to use one column there
[08:38:05] <xec> Jesperhead: i don't recommend using .attr() as that is for attributes (as opposed to properties)
[08:38:13] <hellyeah> i will use one column for something else
[08:38:14] <taplar> hellyeah: then create a new object without that attribute
[08:38:33] <hellyeah> humm
[08:38:35] <Jesperhead> i see
[08:38:40] <hellyeah> lemme check
[08:38:45] <Jesperhead> negative ramifications?
[08:38:48] <taplar> Jesperhead: xec: if prop() will do the same thing, use that over attr()
[08:39:03] <Jesperhead> will try
[08:39:46] <taplar> i just wasn't sure if it would since it was in the original html
[08:40:28] <Jesperhead> this seems dare i say overly complex?
[08:40:36] <taplar> which part?
[08:40:37] <Jesperhead> not the solution... just all the different variations
[08:40:57] <xec> Jesperhead: not really if you understand what's going on
[08:41:09] <Jesperhead> ive been wracking my brains over this. JS and jQuery and web really arent my forte. java and python for me.
[08:41:24] <Jesperhead> thank you two very much for the input
[08:41:27] <xec> Jesperhead: the main thing to be aware of is the difference between document.getElementById() and $()
[08:42:20] <xec> Jesperhead: $('selector') returns a jquery object with its own properties, while document.etc grabs the native DOM object
[08:42:47] <Jesperhead> oh right
[08:42:49] <Jesperhead> whats a dom
[08:42:55] <taplar> document object model
[08:43:03] <xec> opposite of submissive
[08:43:08] <Jesperhead> thank you
[08:43:11] <taplar> it's the underlying object that the browser uses to draw the page
[08:43:22] <taplar> html is parsed into the dom
[08:44:03] <xec> Jesperhead: a jquery collection is basically (usually) a wrapper around  DOM elements with its own api
[08:44:31] <Jesperhead> making more sense to me now
[08:44:34] <xec> Jesperhead: basically because the native dom methods are rather unintuitive and verbose
[08:45:08] <taplar> and possibly missing from browser(version) to browser(version)
[08:45:12] <Xatenev> (12:51:16) Jesperhead: WIDDLYWIDDLYWIDDLY YEEEAAAAAA
[08:45:14] <xec> exactly
[08:45:18] <Xatenev> wait what
[08:45:26] <Xatenev> xd
[08:45:35] <Jesperhead> Xatenev: Yes... Im sorry... he asked if i had a "fiddle".... i thought he meant "guitar"
[08:45:50] <Xatenev> Jesperhead: im done with my life now
[08:45:57] <Xatenev> thats too funny xd
[08:46:16] <xec> lol
[08:46:23] <Jesperhead> lol. no but wait, its also because of my name. Jesper Stromblaad is the former guitarist of In Flames, whose mascot is a jester head
[08:46:32] <Jesperhead> thus MY name, and the confusion.
[08:46:45] <taplar> so much context there i otherwise wouldn't know
[08:47:00] <Jesperhead> i mean... fiddle + music makes more sense to me than fiddle + code haha
[08:47:10] <taplar> until now, bwahahahahaha
[08:47:12] <xec> the best jokes are the ones that need a long explanation. makes them last longer.
[08:47:41] <Jesperhead> :D well this morning is off to a good start folks. thanks for indulging my failures.
[08:48:10] <Jesperhead> i wish you all the best.
[08:48:16] <xec> happy coding :)
[08:49:05] <hellyeah> hey it may be simple question but how can i get project_name part here http://jsfiddle.net/btLpd4bw/4/
[08:49:48] <taplar> uh, you are getting it
[08:49:52] <taplar> look at your console
[08:50:44] <hellyeah> i may forget updating
[08:50:48] <hellyeah> i got undefined http://jsfiddle.net/btLpd4bw/7/

[08:51:41] <hellyeah> yea i want to get column name
[08:51:44] <xec> oh
[08:51:57] <xec> Object.keys(element) ?

[08:52:21] <xec> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/btLpd4bw/10/
[08:52:27] <taplar> you said you were wanting to exclude one of them earlier.  which one?
[08:52:34] <taplar> hellyeah: ^
[08:52:54] <hellyeah> button_name
[08:53:22] <hellyeah> i just wat to get this part "project_name":"University","environment":"Prod","frontend":"Monitor"

[08:58:10] <xec> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/btLpd4bw/14/ !!!
[08:58:24] <xec> simple to read, easy to use, understandable code (tm)
[08:58:48] <xec> in fact, all code should have at least one line looking like "}, {})));"
[08:58:55] <taplar> lmao
[08:59:17] <hellyeah> {} :XD
[09:00:33] <lordjancso> i'm using jquery 2.1.3 and my .data() function is not working, i have to use .attr()
[09:00:45] <lordjancso> is there no .data() function anymore?
[09:00:55] <xec> lordjancso: there is, what's it failing at?
[09:01:06] <xec> (i.e. what are you trying to do)
[09:01:12] <lordjancso> xec simply just nothing happened
[09:01:26] <xec> that's exactly what it's for (j/k)
[09:01:28] <lordjancso> domain.data('xxx', 'yyy'); //not working
[09:01:35] <lordjancso> domain.attr('data-aaa', 'bbb'); //working
[09:02:06] <xec> lordjancso: they do different things, .attr() writes and reads attributes
[09:02:07] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/btLpd4bw/15/ :P
[09:02:29] <lordjancso> xec i know and .data is a setter-getter
[09:02:29] <xec> lordjancso: you could do domain.data('xxx') and it should return  'yyy'
[09:02:33] <hellyeah> brb
[09:02:50] <lordjancso> xec i want to set/write/create data attribute
[09:02:56] <xec> lordjancso: but you won't see it as a data-xxx attribute in the DOM
[09:03:04] <xec> lordjancso: that should work then
[09:03:15] <xec> sorry
[09:03:18] <xec> should not*
[09:03:24] <lordjancso> xec why not?
[09:03:31] <xec> lordjancso: .data() does not write to attributes
[09:03:45] <xec> it simply stores data on an object and you can read it back with .data()
[09:03:59] <lordjancso> xec documentation says different: https://api.jquery.com/data/#data1
[09:04:27] <xec> lordjancso: where exactly does it say it writes to data-* attributes?
[09:04:54] <xec> lordjancso: it will read in the original starting value
[09:04:55] <Uhkis> it says exactly what xec said
[09:05:13] <lordjancso> ohh ok
[09:05:21] <lordjancso> so which one should i use? data or attr?
[09:05:35] <taplar> depends on what your trying to do
[09:05:36] <lordjancso> whats the difference in practice?
[09:05:37] <xec> lordjancso: do you really need to write to data attributes?
[09:05:46] <xec> lordjancso: what is it for
[09:05:55] <taplar> if your trying to change a standard element attribute, use prop() or attr()
[09:06:04] <taplar> if your trying to store non standard information, use data()
[09:06:14] <xec> lordjancso: if you want to store arbitrary data you can get back, use .data() - for writing attributes, use .attr()
[09:06:19] <lordjancso> what do you mean non-standard?
[09:06:21] <xec> what taplar said :)
[09:06:28] <taplar> for instance
[09:06:32] <taplar> an input tag
[09:06:45] <taplar> standard attributes, type, style, maxlength
[09:06:46] <lordjancso> ohh so i can store jquery objects with .data?
[09:06:58] <lordjancso> hmm cool
[09:07:00] <taplar> non standard, item-id, user-name, day-of-week
[09:07:00] <xec> lordjancso: that seems a bit backwards but sure
[09:07:14] <xec> lordjancso: you can store any js object or array or string etc
[09:07:24] <lordjancso> xec i see thank you!
[09:08:44] <taplar> data is handy for storing extra information about an entity without having to create lots of hidden inputs or having javascirpt variables hanging around
[09:08:55] <taplar> also by them being attached to an element, they automatically have context
[09:51:15] <deepy> Anyone happen to know of a plugin that makes a table sortable and resizable?
[09:54:56] <noahmg123> deepy: sorry, no.
[09:55:44] <deepy> it's the last thing I need to be able to replace the worthless ui we have with something better
[09:56:30] <noahmg123> How can I use functions like val() on an array (e.g. $('.class')[0].val()). It says $('...')[0].val() is not a function.
[09:57:17] <Cork> deepy: you're looking for a plugin where you can resize the columns you mean?
[09:57:33] <Cork> noahmg123: .eq(0)
[09:57:43] <deepy> Cork: we have a shitty table implementation, I want to be able to resize the columns and be able to sort by clicking on a column
[09:57:53] <Cork> [0] returns the raw dom element .eq() returns one wrapped in jquery
[09:57:55] <noahmg123> Cork: I tried that. let me check again.
[09:58:00] <deepy> If I get that I can get 800 lines of terrible javascript to die in a fire
[09:58:19] <Cork> deepy: looks like you want one of the many grid plugins
[09:58:32] <fifthshift> deepy datatables.net
[09:58:37] <Cork> datatable, datagrid, flexgrid...
[09:59:00] <noahmg123> Cork: it says it is not a function. I am actually using $$ on a local file. Is $ more limited than $?
[09:59:20] <Cork> noahmg123: $$ isn't jquery
[09:59:27] <Cork> sounds like your using prototype not jquery
[09:59:49] <noahmg123> Cork: ok. So then how can I use jQuery on a local file?
[10:00:02] <Cork> you would have to include the jquery lib
[10:00:39] <fifthshift> noahmg123 download the jQuery library and link it to your document with an appropriate path
[10:01:30] <noahmg123> fifthshift: hmmm... well I have many files that I need to use it on. Is there a way to link to it in the Chrome Dev Tools?
[10:03:41] <fifthshift> noahmg123 I'm not positive I understand you
[10:04:25] <noahmg123> fifthshift: is there anyway to make it where yiu can just use $ at any time, on any page, in the Chrome Dev Tools?
[10:04:54] <TheSin> Hi I'm using jquery-mobile 1.4.5 and I have a popup that I want to attach to the origin element, it works in chrome but not firefox or safari, and if I resize in all 3 of the broswers it breaks it.  Any ideas or things that could cause this behaviour?
[10:06:36] <fifthshift> noahmg123 good question
[10:06:40] <fifthshift> looks like this is an answer
[10:06:41] <fifthshift> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7474354/include-jquery-in-the-javascript-console
[10:13:34] <noahmg123> fifthshift: thx.
[10:48:54] <Eburitus> how do I hide dialog of jqueryui by default and open it when needed?
[10:49:31] <taplar> $(selector).dialog('hide');
[10:51:06] <taplar> crap, wrong component
[10:51:12] <Eburitus> doesn't work. it either prints <div> normally, or opens the dialog.
[10:51:21] <Cork> Eburitus: autoOpen: false
[10:51:22] <taplar> actually 'close': http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-close
[10:51:44] <Cork> taplar: he talked aobut "open by default" not about how to close it
[10:51:59] <taplar> ah
[10:55:12] <Eburitus> Cork: ty. seems to work.
[10:55:37] <Cork> Eburitus: it should as it explicitly why the option is there :)
[10:55:45] <Eburitus> :)
[10:55:46] <Cork> *as it is why*
[11:12:59] <jfive> hello all
[11:13:04] <jfive> in a selector such as: 'a[href*="http://domain.com/"]' why would it be that this only works on another server without the double quotes?
[11:13:16] <jfive> actually sorry, no...
[11:13:24] <jfive> in a selector such as: 'a[href*="vhost.domain.com"]' why would it be that this only works on another server without the double quotes?
[11:13:47] <jfive> on my local environment it works _with_ the quotes, but on a remote server it only works _without_ them
[11:31:10] <isthisreallife> hi

[11:31:19] <isthisreallife> ??
[11:31:45] <isthisreallife> even though i get field name in line 10
[11:31:54] <isthisreallife> why it doesnt work wtf
[11:31:58] <Guest3333> I'm running into a small issue.  I'm trying to check if count is equal to 0 or divisible by 2 and then output some text.  Can anyone help?  http://kopy.io/zqZmS
[11:31:59] <isthisreallife> help plox
[11:32:03] <isthisreallife> achtung!
[11:35:56] <taplar> Guest3333: that should work
[11:36:08] <taplar> this isn't valid though: $('.test').append('</div>');
[11:36:27] <Guest3333> taplar what should i be doing instead?
[11:36:34] <taplar> that's unnecessary
[11:36:40] <taplar> you just append to your parent
[11:37:11] <taplar> i'm assuming your wanting to append to the created row?
[11:38:04] <Guest3333> I need to append the row to the parent '.test' and then append the two col-sm-6 to the created row.  I need to do it three times.
[11:39:04] <taplar> one sec
[11:44:08] <taplar> maybe something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/d7kxrgoj/
[11:46:23] <Xatenev> Heya
[11:46:24] <Xatenev> a question
[11:46:31] <Xatenev> via jquery im switching the background image of an element
[11:46:43] <Xatenev> which produces some.. idk how to say it
[11:46:45] <Xatenev> white flash effect
[11:46:53] <Xatenev> dunno if u get me
[11:47:01] <taplar> flashes while the second image is loading
[11:47:04] <mtt5> image is loading?
[11:47:05] <Xatenev> yea right
[11:47:08] <Xatenev> what would be a good approahc to hide that
[11:47:16] <robertmaxrees> sprites
[11:47:28] <robertmaxrees> or hiding/showing elements instead of swapping the background image.
[11:47:38] <Xatenev> yea but we have 14 big backrgound images here
[11:47:54] <Xatenev> sounds bad to load them all
[11:47:55] <Xatenev> xd
[11:48:06] <robertmaxrees> how many and how big?
[11:48:19] <Xatenev> 14 x 100kb
[11:50:45] <robertmaxrees> are those compressed
[11:50:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[11:50:52] <robertmaxrees> and the right resolution?
[11:50:53] <robertmaxrees> etc?
[11:51:11] <Xatenev> robertmaxrees: yea
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> then you're stuck with some weird preloading setup to handle it.
[11:51:57] <Guest3333> taplar that worked.  Thank you so much
[11:52:02] <taplar> np
[11:58:55] <jfive> hello... can anyone tell me why this works: $('a[href*="sitename.localhost"]'); but this doesn't: $('a[href*="sitename.devserver.com"]');
[11:59:37] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the rendered markup, nope.
[12:00:32] <Xatenev> yea well
[12:00:37] <Xatenev> some css3 image preloading saved me :)
[12:00:47] <Xatenev> i just got a div preloading all images now and it works
[12:02:43] <jfive> lmao @ robertmaxrees
[12:02:59] <jfive> the rendered markup, in both cases, contains the hostname we are targeting
[12:03:20] <dcherman> jfive: first guess?  you need to escape the `.` - https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:08:48] <Xatenev> is there some less guy in here who can help me in private? ( I asked in #css alrdy)
[12:09:31] <taplar> i've tinkered with less before, what's up?
[12:09:46] <Xatenev> taplar: sec maybe i just found it
[12:09:54] <taplar> even better, :)
[12:12:09] <Xatenev> taplar: nope
[12:12:11] <Xatenev> nevermind
[12:12:11] <Xatenev> :D
[12:13:01] <Xatenev> taplar: http://pastebin.com/Q1fKrYSF
[12:13:13] <Xatenev> basically i wanna convert all that shit into a loop
[12:13:14] <Xatenev> xd
[12:13:25] <Xatenev> actually right now, nothing is rendered o.o
[12:13:52] <taplar> heh, and that's outside of my tinkering, :s
[12:14:08] <Xatenev> taplar: xd
[12:14:15] <Xatenev> Im so close to the solution, i basically feel it
[12:14:20] <Xatenev> but it just renders nothing xd
[12:14:48] <taplar> dunno if it will help but just googled: http://lesscss.org/features/#loops-feature
[12:15:59] <Xatenev> omg im an idiot
[12:15:59] <Xatenev> sec
[12:18:13] <Xatenev> taplar: ok it cant work because the first element has to start differently
[12:18:25] <Xatenev> because the first element has to start with background: url().. then commaseperated ,url() ,url()
[12:18:30] <Xatenev> you cant do that in less it seems
[12:21:59] <relipse3> does $().val(foobar) urlencode foobar?
[12:22:21] <relipse3> for some reason I put commas and pipes and BEFORE submission i'm getting %7C
[12:22:30] <relipse3> or %2C
[12:22:37] <relipse3> how do I disable that?
[12:22:50] <taplar> i don't believe val() encodes
[12:22:57] <taplar> console log your foobar and see what it is
[12:24:57] <relipse3> ok you are right it doesnt
[12:25:00] <relipse3> i am encoding it
[12:25:00] <relipse3> thanks
[12:25:16] <taplar> decodeURIComponent(foobar)

[12:33:16] <jonez> I need some help with my use of jqueryui's tooltip widget. if I hover and then hover out too quickly, the tooltip does not disappear
[12:33:55] <DanielWebi> hello
[12:35:48] <DanielWebi> i need some help too
[12:38:02] <taplar> feel free to ask.  if someone is available and has an idea they'll speak up
[12:41:42] <taplar> try.jquery.com is useful if your are unfamiliar with the basics
[12:44:35] <taplar> the room is open to helping you learn to solve problems.  just tell us what your trying to do, giving a working example of what you've tried is encouraged, and take it from there.
[12:45:19] <taplar> we also encourage the discussions to be in the public chat, rather than private, to allow for more users to provide input and so others can reveiw and possibly learn too
[12:45:42] <DanielWebi> where i can give the exemple ?
[12:46:01] <taplar> you can use sites like jsfiddle.net to create a small demo
[12:46:33] <DanielWebi> ok thank you and after that i put the link here ?
[12:46:38] <taplar> yep
[12:46:48] <DanielWebi> cheers!
[12:55:03] <DanielWebi> what i tryed is to go in a smooth way down until i find all the links
[12:55:05] <DanielWebi> http://jsfiddle.net/8qdszfq2/
[12:58:11] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/8qdszfq2/1/ <-- I added the jquery include on the left hand side, fixed a typo you had in your final selector, and also you only need one document ready
[12:58:16] <taplar> so what are you trying to do?
[13:00:08] <DanielWebi> when i click on home..about or portofolio, an ¨a¨ tag to scroll me down slow until i arive on the home content, about content..
[13:02:30] <taplar> take a look at scrollTop: http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[13:09:00] <AcidRain> hello
[13:09:22] <AcidRain> im using jquery 1.3.0, trying to get the data attribute of a href.
[13:09:28] <AcidRain> getting undefined
[13:09:43] <robertmaxrees> woah - 1.3?
[13:09:45] <AcidRain> alert($(this).attr("data-id"));
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[13:10:03] <robertmaxrees> .data('id');
[13:10:11] <AcidRain> ive tried .data(), i get nothing then. .data() is only available 1.4+
[13:10:19] <robertmaxrees> 1.2.3 +
[13:10:28] <AcidRain> hmmm
[13:10:31] <AcidRain> let me try again
[13:10:39] <robertmaxrees> if it's still busted, share your code :)
[13:10:53] <AcidRain> var href = $(this).data('id');
[13:10:53] <AcidRain>  alert(href);
[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see the markup, too.  go ahead and make a fiddle.
[13:11:23] <AcidRain> making a fiddle is so complex tho lol
[13:11:41] <AcidRain> oh wait
[13:11:44] <AcidRain> i think i see the issue
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kzywn6so/
[13:12:19] <robertmaxrees> that wasn't really that hard /shrug
[13:12:39] <AcidRain> yep got it
[13:12:50] <AcidRain> i wasnt targetting the href inside the div
[13:12:51] <AcidRain> only the div
[13:13:44] <AcidRain> thx for ur help
[13:13:46] <AcidRain> u helped
[14:07:20] <shoky> --++5
[14:08:58] <taplar> o.O
[14:23:11] <mozzarella> I need help
[14:23:20] <robertmaxrees> just ask your question - if somebody can help, they well.
[14:24:28] <mozzarella> when I do $('.someclass').css(â¦), does it only apply to the items that already exist, or also those that are going to be created in the future?
[14:24:39] <taplar> existing
[14:24:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:24:49] <robertmaxrees> $() can only see things as they are right now.
[14:24:51] <taplar> it inlines the css on the matched elements
[14:24:53] <robertmaxrees> not the past or future.
[14:25:04] <mozzarella> aaaawww =/
[14:25:28] <robertmaxrees> give elements classes and go that route instead.
[14:25:47] <taplar> if you want it to effect future elements, you'll have to change your method of attack and put a class on a parent element and style is so that it affects children of that class
[14:25:52] <mozzarella> what do you mean?
[14:26:08] <robertmaxrees> what about his statement was confusing?
[14:26:14] <mozzarella> no, yours
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> what about mind is confusing, then?
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> *mine
[14:26:45] <mozzarella> I'm already giving them classes
[14:26:50] <robertmaxrees> then don't use .css()
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> use actual stylesheets to style them instead.
[14:27:13] <mozzarella> I'm writing a greasemonkey script, IÂ can't touch the css files
[14:27:34] <robertmaxrees> http://superuser.com/questions/94824/how-to-get-firefox-greasemonkey-script-to-use-a-local-cascading-stylesheet
[14:29:00] <mozzarella> then I'll have to ship a css file with my script, not good
[14:29:22] <mozzarella> I used inline styling and it worked perfectly, but some guy in this room told me to not do that
[14:31:38] <mozzarella> taplar: what if I do something like this: $('#torrent_table .thumbnail_col > img').css(â¦)? #torrent_table already exists, but the .thumbnail_col elements don't, will that work?
[14:32:05] <taplar> no, it won't match on them as they don't exist yet
[14:32:05] <robertmaxrees> .css() IS inline styling fwiw.
[14:32:33] <zetlen> remember, inline styling is the new cool thing because javascript is so fun to write and who needs editors
[14:32:42] <zetlen> or syntax highlighting
[14:32:43] <mozzarella> but isn't the style applied to #torrent_table?
[14:32:55] <taplar> no, not the way your selector was given
[14:33:11] <taplar> it would be on images, if matched
[14:33:59] <mozzarella> what do you mean?
[14:34:10] <taplar> '#torrent_table .thumbnail_col > img'
[14:34:48] <taplar> that says: find all images that are direct children of an element with class 'thumbnail_col' who are (in)direct children of an element with the id of 'torrent_table'
[14:34:48] <mozzarella> what does the css function returns, btw?
[14:34:52] <mozzarella> return*
[14:35:32] <taplar> it should return the jquery object that it changed iirc
[14:35:40] <taplar> object(s)
[14:36:07] <mozzarella> does it mean IÂ can chain them?
[14:36:14] <taplar> yep
[14:36:14] <mozzarella> .css().css().css()?
[14:36:33] <taplar> or just css({key1: value1, key2: value2, ... })
[14:36:44] <mozzarella> hmmmmmmm
[14:38:43] <mozzarella> there's no way to add css "globally", as if I added something to the main css file?
[14:39:02] <mozzarella> i.e. it affects new nodes
[14:39:15] <taplar> i thought robert linked in something for greasemonkey earlier that might could
[14:40:04] <mozzarella> yeah, but IÂ would need to ship a css file with my script
[14:40:11] <mozzarella> I can't really do that
[14:40:41] <taplar> well, you could try adding a new style block to the body, worst case
[14:42:52] <mozzarella> aaaww man, robert is gone
[14:42:57] <mozzarella> I wanted to ask him something
[14:46:33] <mozzarella> is { this: "" } the same thing as { "this": "" }?
[14:46:50] <taplar> should be
[14:47:57] <mozzarella> will this { z-index: 9999999 } work or are -'s forbidden (unless in strings)?
[14:49:23] <decx> yes, - is an operator
[14:49:41] <mozzarella> oh right
[14:50:39] <mozzarella> the left side is also evaluated? { "str" + "ing": "string" }?
[14:51:20] <shoky> no. try it and see :\
[14:51:39] <mozzarella> then I don't see why - should be forbidden, it's not ambiguous
[14:52:01] <NoiseEee> mozzarella: thats a mathematical operator in JS, sorry
[14:52:35] <decx> var z = 2, index = 1; z-index == 1
[14:53:15] <mozzarella> yeah, but in { } it's not ambiguous because the lefthand side (the key) is not evaluated
[14:54:15] <decx> it's not valid, live with it
[14:54:38] <NoiseEee> mozzarella: its a property name
[14:54:49] <NoiseEee> you cant name a variable "z-index" either
[14:54:58] <NoiseEee> its a tragedy i know, but we can move on
[14:55:15] <decx> well you could name it "z-index" hehe
[14:55:54] <shoky> an unquoted property name in an objet literal must be a valid js identifier or number
[14:56:20] <shoky> z-index ain't
[15:02:03] <taplar> obj['z-index'] = something should work, no?
[15:02:17] <mozzarella> I guess it's for symmetry?
[15:03:02] <mozzarella> i.e. if you could do that { z-index: 0 } but not that obj[z-index] = 0, that would be weird
[15:03:21] <taplar> you can do obj[z-index], provided z and index are variables, :P
[15:03:31] <mozzarella> you know what I mean
[15:10:18] <decx> just use the bloody quotes damnit
[15:10:31] <taplar> heh
[15:12:16] <taplar> don't be all boyz in da hood, quote like crazy
[15:12:38] <mozzarella> what does append() return? the newly appended node?
[15:12:48] <taplar> the parent operated on
[15:13:00] <mozzarella> ok
[15:14:43] <bfig> hello, I have a question about checkboxes in jquery. How can I bind an event to the checkbox being toggled?
[15:15:22] <taplar> on('change')
[15:15:40] <taplar> $(selector).on('change', callbackFunction);
[15:18:17] <mozzarella> what does html() return?
[15:18:26] <taplar> the innerHTML of the dom node
[15:19:05] <mozzarella> I mean when it's passed an argument, such as $('.item').html('htmlcode')
[15:19:12] <taplar> it sets the innerHTML
[15:19:18] <taplar> replacing anything that was there before
[15:19:19] <mozzarella> but does it return anything?
[15:19:31] <decx> should be the item group
[15:19:35] <taplar> check the docs, :P
[15:19:43] <decx> why dont you just test this stuff?
[15:23:17] <mozzarella> taplar: the docs say "returns: jquery", that's not helpful
[15:23:55] <taplar> "jquery" is typically meaning a jquery object
[15:24:00] <taplar> on that context
[15:24:02] <taplar> *in
[15:29:05] <mozzarella> it says after() returns a jquery object, but which one? the one it has created or the parent?
[15:29:12] <mozzarella> or something else entirely?
[15:29:50] <NoiseEee> mozzarella: if only there was a way to check that out...
[15:31:59] <mozzarella> tell me?
[15:35:04] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/7oruv3go/ @ mozzarella
[15:39:47] <mozzarella> NoiseEee: Object { 0: <div#target>, length: 1, context: HTMLDocument â show, selector: "#target" }
[15:40:01] <mozzarella> so it returns #target?
[15:40:40] <NoiseEee> well in my case it does because the div I inserted after had the id "target"
[15:42:49] <mozzarella> NoiseEee: jquery automatically closes your div?
[15:43:03] <taplar> jquery creates dom nodes.
[15:43:26] <taplar> so yes, in a manner of speaking
[15:44:11] <mozzarella> what would $('div', { id: 'new' }) do?
[15:44:18] <mozzarella> without the <>'s
[15:44:39] <taplar> fiddle it up and see
[15:46:03] <mozzarella> well, it doesn't seem to do anything meaningful
[15:48:35] <NoiseEee> mozzarella: no reason it should
[15:48:54] <NoiseEee> mozzarella: why don't you read about jquery, fool around, and come back here with some specific questions
[15:48:56] <NoiseEee> good luck!
[15:49:14] <mozzarella> I'm learning by doing
[15:49:32] <NoiseEee> a great approach for things not programming
[16:27:53] <tehopeologist> how can i preventDefault on a radio button?
[16:28:07] <tehopeologist> i have a click handler set but it doesn't seem to be overriding the event
[16:29:06] <tehopeologist> here's what i'm doing: http://jsfiddle.net/t35uxocy/
[16:29:36] <tehopeologist> when i breakpoint at the preventDefault and check $(this).prop('checked') it's true
[16:30:28] <NoiseEee> preventDefault?
[16:30:33] <NoiseEee> it doesn't really do anything
[16:30:54] <NoiseEee> you want to prevent it from being checked or?
[16:31:15] <tehopeologist> yes
[16:31:34] <tehopeologist> i see i should be using .on
[16:31:37] <tehopeologist> so i switched to that
[16:31:57] <tehopeologist> mousedown doesn't work for the event, so i moved it to click and it still says true when the breakpoint hits
[16:32:08] <NoiseEee> preventDefault doesn't do things like that
[16:32:17] <NoiseEee> you can check to see if its checked, and then remove it yourself
[16:32:19] <tehopeologist> i tried stopPropagation() as well
[16:32:42] <tehopeologist> i'm styling based on checked, so i want to be in control of when the element gets checked or not
[16:32:56] <NoiseEee> preventDefault is not meant to be used to prevent an input from being selected/checked, etc
[16:33:09] <tehopeologist> ok, does stopPropagation do that ?
[16:33:12] <NoiseEee> no
[16:33:23] <NoiseEee> i'm telling you to remove the 'checked' property yourself
[16:33:26] <NoiseEee> prop('checked',false)
[16:33:39] <tehopeologist> i'm going to have styles flicker that way i think =/
[16:35:03] <NoiseEee> tehopeologist: try it out, otherwise use a class
[17:08:57] <guideX> I'm using the input file and uploading webcam pics
[17:09:04] <guideX> but on android, it blows up trying to send over ajax
[17:09:18] <guideX> I get a 500 error from the server, I haven't been able to figure out yet
[17:09:41] <guideX> on ios, desktop, works fine
[17:10:33] <NoiseEee> do you have access to the server logs, or is there a response body alongside the 500 error?
[17:11:01] <guideX> I have access to the server, but there's no event log errors
[17:11:12] <guideX> seems like the blowing up code doesn't bubble up to the front
[17:11:25] <guideX> in the js, I did this: var r = jQuery.parseJSON(XMLHttpRequest.responseText); alert("Message: " + r.Message);
[17:11:33] <guideX> but on android, there's no alert when I do it that way
[17:12:12] <guideX> I know A) the image data is not null, B) it gets all the way to the ajax portion, however once the ajax call is made, blows up
[17:12:23] <NoiseEee> well a 500 error happens on a server, and unless you've set up that server in a crazy way, you should have an error in your server logs with more details.
[17:12:25] <guideX> on ios and desktop of course, it's fine...
[17:12:36] <NoiseEee> sure it blows up, you got a 500
[17:12:45] <NoiseEee> but only the server knows what up.
[17:12:59] <guideX> hrm ok, so better error handling is in order
[17:21:10] <ncksnydr> Is this the correct channel/forum for support? Specifically for AMD and jQuery UI?
[17:21:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:26:11] <Birliban> Hi, I have a selection problem, could someone pls look at: http://jsfiddle.net/1aqmpa9a
[17:26:57] <Birliban> sorry, this is the right one http://jsfiddle.net/1aqmpa9a/1
[17:27:20] <robertmaxrees> because it's called "foo" not beraterID
[17:27:39] <Birliban> robertmaxrees: yes, please look at the updated link ;-)
[17:28:47] <robertmaxrees> detailsid
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/1aqmpa9a/3/
[17:29:17] <Birliban> robertmaxrees: wahhh :-(
[17:29:24] <Birliban> thank you!!!
[17:30:16] <Birliban> so in data  attribute all chars are getting lowercase
[17:30:52] <robertmaxrees> unless it's dasherized
[17:31:00] <robertmaxrees> some-id becomes someId
[17:31:41] <Birliban> robertmaxrees: yes, that was an example in the docs... but lowercase was not in my mind. Thanks!
[17:41:14] <ncksnydr> Cool. I'm trying to load jQuery UI widgets via RequireJS. I downloaded jQuery UI via Bower and placed it in JS->Vendor->jquery-ui. I am able to load jQuery and get it to `console.log('$');` successfully. However, when I try to call the module to load a $.ui.accordion, RequireJS attempts to load `./core` and `./widget` from the root, rather than the same directory as `accordion.js`. Here is a Fiddle with some screenshots to illustrat
[17:41:53] <ncksnydr> https://jsfiddle.net/cwo8mmte/3/
[17:42:03] <ncksnydr> SorryâI guess I hit a text limit.
[17:44:39] <guideX> how to use json3?
[17:56:49] <Synthead> this is a little hackish, but see if you can figure this out:
[17:57:17] <Synthead> I have an icon with a jQuery toolip, and this icon triggers an event where it gets destroyed and replaced with something else
[17:57:30] <Synthead> when this happens, the tooltip stays on the document indefinitely
[17:57:34] <Synthead> not a biggie, I can close it
[17:57:59] <Synthead> but then, to the user, the tooltip went away.  so here's the goal:
[17:58:39] <Synthead> to open any appropriate tooltips for elements that the cursor is hovering over
[17:58:59] <Synthead> at the moment, the tooltip re-appears when the cursor is moved one pixel (and it's still over said element)
[17:59:31] <Synthead> but I want it to appear as if the tooltip was never destroyed, while not having the buggy behavior where it's permanently visible
[18:39:53] <s2013> if i do something like myDiv = $("#my_div") .. then how do i get the id of the div that myDiv is
[18:40:01] <robertmaxrees> you already have it.
[18:40:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, this.id
[18:40:24] <inthl> I have a datatable with a data: someJSON set. now I would like to update/change that data to another JSON by some event, what's the best way to do that, in your opinion? I would like to avoid fnDestroy  and recreate of the table
[18:40:54] <s2013> well ok so .. if i do myDiv = $("#my_div") .. but myDiv == $("#my_div") returns flase
[18:41:22] <s2013> how do i check if the variable is the same as another element i choose
[18:42:03] <s2013> i guess .attr would work
[18:42:17] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:42:19] <robertmaxrees> then you want .is()
[18:42:40] <robertmaxrees> myDiv.is($('#my_div'));
[18:42:58] <s2013> oh
[18:43:02] <totallyserious> Hey is there a way to load a json file from the browser?
[18:43:08] <totallyserious> I mean from the html itself
[18:43:27] <robertmaxrees> s2013 $() always returns a new object, and because of some funk, there's no way to do a simple equality check.
[18:43:33] <s2013> oh ok
[18:43:44] <robertmaxrees> totallyserious sure - assign it to a variable in that file and include it via a script.
[18:43:49] <robertmaxrees> *script tag.
[18:43:57] <totallyserious> and have it as a JS rather than json right
[18:46:16] <robertmaxrees> well i mean if you assign the code to a variable in the file it's no longer JSON.
[19:12:43] <guideX> is there some difference between the input file control in android and the one everywhere else
[19:13:18] <guideX> which makes it so you can't access it like this always: [0].files[0]
[19:13:31] <guideX> $("#myfile")[0].files[0]
[19:13:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:14:07] <guideX> having a weird problem on android with the file upload control, ajax, and c#
[19:14:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're having?
[19:14:17] <guideX> where it only blows up (on the server side) on android
[19:14:24] <guideX> with a 500 error
[19:14:52] <guideX> I will be figuring out on the server side with better error handling, but for now, I can't see the error 100%
[19:15:12] <guideX> I only know, on android (some not all) it blows up somewhere during the ajax post
[19:15:17] <guideX> sending an image in base64
[19:15:25] * guideX confused
[19:15:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the error then.
[19:15:48] <guideX> make matters worse, I don't have one of the androids it's blowing up with
[19:16:08] <robertmaxrees> are you getting this from a user?
[19:16:11] <robertmaxrees> or a few users?
[19:16:18] <guideX> from multiple users over wifi
[19:16:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd have to see the erropr then.
[19:16:34] <guideX> I was able to use one of them for testing, and determined it blows up with server error 500 during the ajax post
[19:16:46] <guideX> see it coming through the "failure"
[19:16:48] <guideX> in ajax
[19:16:57] <robertmaxrees> right - it's erroring.
[19:17:02] <robertmaxrees> but why is it throwing the 500?
[19:17:30] <guideX> I'm also sending along with it, a datetime and a feww more strings
[19:17:44] <robertmaxrees> so none of that is helpful lol.
[19:17:45] <guideX> I have this theory json.stringify doesn't serialize that date correctly
[19:17:54] <guideX> so maybe json3 might help that?
[19:17:58] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:18:16] <robertmaxrees> what exactlly are you stringifying with that date?
[19:18:27] <robertmaxrees> like, you're not providing nearly enough information to work off of.
[19:18:36] <guideX> well I use data: JSON.stringify(data),
[19:18:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:18:44] <robertmaxrees> right, and data is...?
[19:19:01] <robertmaxrees> is the date just date: new Date(), ?
[19:19:02] <guideX> data = { Canvas: iosPic, Attachmentnotes: notes };
[19:19:08] <guideX> oh and the date is in there
[19:19:11] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual error on the C# side.
[19:19:26] <robertmaxrees> stack traces are really helpful in cases like this.
[19:19:37] <guideX> unfortunately there's no event viewer error, I have a new version which handles the errors better, but for now I'm in the dark
[19:19:49] <robertmaxrees> so i'd dig through that side first.
[19:19:52] <guideX> I'm not sure why the event viewer errors aren't there, or whY can't get more via the javascript
[19:19:54] <robertmaxrees> figure out what on the server is failing.
[19:20:06] <robertmaxrees> becuase the JS isn't where the error is occurring.
[19:20:14] <robertmaxrees> the server is throwing a 500 - you need to figure out the cause of that.
[19:20:18] <guideX> one thing is for sure, it's happening on specific android devices
[19:20:37] <robertmaxrees> right - so what about that request is failing?
[19:20:37] <guideX> meaning I cannot replicate it myself, but others can't use it at all with whatever specific android deviced
[19:20:38] <robertmaxrees> on the server.
[19:20:42] <guideX> hmm
[19:20:54] <robertmaxrees> that'll inform the client-side fixes you need to make.
[19:20:55] <guideX> I am working to find that out, I'm kind of without that for now unfortunately
[19:21:08] <robertmaxrees> so then there's not really much else you can do.
[19:21:15] <robertmaxrees> unless you share out your code with all of us.
[19:21:26] <guideX> I can do that... let me make a pastebin
[19:21:32] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[19:21:41] <guideX> I cannot reach jsfiddle it's blocked here
[19:21:54] <robertmaxrees> then use bpaste or a less awful paste service.
[19:22:02] <guideX> ok
[19:22:24] <guideX> one second
[19:26:10] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:26:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:28:31] <guideX> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/ca637e475d49
[19:28:35] <guideX> sorry for delay
[19:28:47] <robertmaxrees> err.
[19:28:50] <guideX> I included everything except for the database uypdate stuff
[19:29:09] <robertmaxrees> oh that's c# at the bottom.
[19:29:14] <robertmaxrees> i didn't care about that part.
[19:29:21] <guideX> <input type="file" capture="camera" accept="image/*" id="iosCameraUpdate" name="iosCameraUpdate" onchange="$('#pnlIosUpload').show(); return false;" />
[19:29:23] <guideX> for got that
[19:29:58] <guideX> so anything that looks suspiciolus (for android) would be appretiated
[19:30:01] <guideX> or hints etc
[19:30:06] <robertmaxrees> err,
[19:30:31] <robertmaxrees> you have a bunch of global vars in here.
[19:31:08] <guideX> hrm
[19:31:20] <guideX> they're all inside of UploadWebcamAttachment() though right
[19:31:21] <robertmaxrees> if ($("#pnlIosVideo #iosCameraUpdate")[0].files.length != 0) { - redundant.  $("#iosCameraUpdate")[0].files.length) is all you need there.
[19:31:41] <guideX> oh hrm
[19:31:46] <guideX> is there a problem with that?
[19:31:55] <guideX> I was truying to check the length of files
[19:31:58] <guideX> make sure there's one
[19:32:10] <guideX> or you saying the selector is bad
[19:32:17] <robertmaxrees> your version is redundant and is doing too much.
[19:32:21] <robertmaxrees> the selector included.
[19:32:31] <robertmaxrees> notes isn't defined anywhere i can see.
[19:32:46] <guideX> sorry, I removed that part :)
[19:33:07] <robertmaxrees> Date is a reserved word.
[19:33:08] <guideX> that was like var notes = $("#txtNotes").val() or something
[19:33:16] <robertmaxrees> need to be careful using thta for a property name.
[19:33:19] <guideX> it's not Date in the real version don't worry
[19:33:25] <guideX> it's like somethingDate
[19:33:33] <robertmaxrees> so then this isn't the real code.
[19:33:35] <guideX> sorry I changed the word in the paste to protect the innocent
[19:33:37] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not goingto look at it.
[19:33:44] <guideX> well most everything else is real
[19:33:50] <robertmaxrees> except it's obviously not.
[19:33:52] <guideX> ok... hrm, let me paste a new then
[19:33:55] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not going to waste my time.
[19:34:00] <robertmaxrees> and this is kind of futile.
[19:34:18] <guideX> hrm ok, I mean the general idea is there..
[19:34:20] <robertmaxrees> you really need to focus on the server-side error.
[19:34:26] <robertmaxrees> and figure that part out first.
[19:34:28] <guideX> ok I see, so you think it's there anyways ok
[19:34:30] <robertmaxrees> and/or use a tool like ghostlab.
[19:34:34] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[19:34:56] <robertmaxrees> the 500 is caused by the server.  you obviously don't know what's causing that error - you could fix the client side for that error.
[19:35:01] <robertmaxrees> but you don't know what to fix.
[19:35:13] <robertmaxrees> finding what's causing the 500 server-side will inform the client-side fix.
[19:35:27] <guideX> oh I'm aware, I was just looking for clues
[19:35:34] <guideX> maybe something specific I'm doing on the client side or something
[19:35:35] <robertmaxrees> the 500 is where you need to be looking.
[19:49:43] <LindsayMac> I feel like an idiot.. why isn't closest working in this scenario? http://jsfiddle.net/5z648z4p/
[19:50:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't see closest being used here.
[19:50:27] <LindsayMac> oh oops.. one sec
[19:50:52] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i cleared it to test something http://jsfiddle.net/5z648z4p/1/
[19:51:04] <robertmaxrees> .closest() goes "up" the tree.
[19:51:06] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  it returns the same span with .closest('a')
[19:51:10] <LindsayMac> ohhhh
[19:51:17] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[19:51:32] <LindsayMac> Silly me.. i thought it just found the closest one
[19:51:45] <robertmaxrees> "closest" is an ephemeral concept.
[19:51:52] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  lol apparently
[19:52:08] <robertmaxrees> e.target would get you the a tag in that case, too.
[19:53:16] <LindsayMac> e.target refreshes the page though when clicked right? eveb with preventDefault?
[19:53:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:53:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/5z648z4p/2/
[19:53:51] <LindsayMac> I dont know what I was saying.. sorry
[19:54:36] <LindsayMac> blaming the overtiredness lol.. thank you
[20:48:33] <Horacsio> hi. I might have some CSS issue here, but when I .fadeIn or .fadeOut between two divs, it seems like one is coming from bottom to final positionâ¦ whyâs that?
[21:03:18] <Horacsio> hi. I might have some CSS issue here, but when I .fadeIn or .fadeOut between two divs, it seems like one is coming from bottom to final positionâ¦ whyâs that?
[21:05:41] <jonez> Horacsio, iirc fadein changes opacity.. are the two divs positioned fairly close to each other?
[21:07:51] <Horacsio> jonez: in the end both will be in the same place. but it seems like when hiding one and showing other, the hidden goes down the showed. if you know what I mean.
[21:08:15] <jonez> maybe make a jsfiddle so I can see it
[21:08:29] <jonez> my jquery-foo is not "expert" or "master" but I think I can help
[21:08:33] <jonez> ;)
[21:09:23] <Horacsio> jonez I canât do that because of its under a bigger code. itâs a jq from woocommerce plugin.
[21:09:35] <Horacsio> but I can screencast for you
[21:10:54] <Horacsio> would that help?
[21:12:58] <Horacsio> guess it doesnt help :D
[21:23:18] <Horacsio> can anyone explain me why this happend? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5441525/SemNome.mov
[21:23:48] <Horacsio> the toogle should happen in the same place.
[21:43:54] <pyCasso> help need to understand how to load a custom methods dependent on jquery
[23:38:56] <d3m0n> How can I make this so the clickEvent variable isn't shared by each element? Is the only way to wrap it in a function? http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/JYvwbK
