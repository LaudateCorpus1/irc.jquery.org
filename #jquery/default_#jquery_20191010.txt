[03:26:38] <weijunli>  theres any way i can send images from file:/// to a server? Remember that my html file do have access to the file URI because it runs on file:/// too
[03:27:27] <robertmaxrees> weijunli just like i said in ##javascript earlier, no.
[03:27:41] <robertmaxrees> you can't circumvent that part of browser security.
[03:27:55] <Cork> and asking again and again in here won't help either
[03:28:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[03:28:04] <Cork> i told you the same thing last week
[03:28:23] <robertmaxrees> The implication behind your request is that any site could grab any file on your device and then upload it.
[03:28:28] <robertmaxrees> which is obviously a bad idea.
[03:28:41] <robertmaxrees> it's not just a CORS issue, like you keep insisting it is.
[03:29:13] <Cork> ya, it is more of a reverse cors issue
[03:29:23] <Cork> as the source is the problem, not the target
[03:29:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[03:30:01] <Cork> like i told you last week, your only optino is a file picker
[03:30:15] <Cork> or to use something like electron
[03:31:15] <robertmaxrees> weijunli so try asking again and see what happens ;)
[03:31:26] <weijunli> this feature is limited to chrome right, it should work on firefox?
[03:31:31] <robertmaxrees> LMAO
[03:31:32] <Cork> ...
[03:31:40] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to work in any browser.
[03:32:08] <robertmaxrees> again - you can't circumvent that part of browser security. The implication behind your request is that any site could grab
[03:32:08] <robertmaxrees> any file on your device and then upload it.
[03:32:22] <Cork> electron what is used to make desktop apps with js+html, it is your only option to get this working
[03:32:47] <weijunli> Cork, send me the url to electron please, im not familiar with it
[03:32:56] <Cork> browsers is running untrusted code from random servers, it has to be very careful what it lets it access
[03:33:02] <robertmaxrees> https://electronjs.org/
[03:33:23] <robertmaxrees> and take your question out of here, since it has nothing to do with jquery :)
[03:34:06] <weijunli> i assume it does the same as cordova
[03:34:25] <robertmaxrees> take it elsewhere.
[13:09:52] <on3pk> I'm trying to upload an image blob from a canvas.  Are JS promises not the same as jquery promises?
[13:10:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery deferreds and fully promises complianet.
[13:10:55] <robertmaxrees> *compliant
[13:11:16] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're having?
[13:11:28] <on3pk> Ah.  Well I must be doing something else wrong, then...  I'm trying to use the $.when() function and getting some Illegal invocation TypeError
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> show some code :)
[13:14:59] <on3pk> robertmaxrees, https://pastebin.com/V39KqfqT  I think that is redacted but still readable
[13:15:42] <on3pk> (hopefully)
[13:15:48] <robertmaxrees> ah, so $.when() takes promises.  you're giving it a function
[13:16:38] <robertmaxrees> uploadImageBlob is a function - you're not even calling it.
[13:17:01] <robertmaxrees> it's expecting two args and you're supplying neither.
[13:17:21] <robertmaxrees> on3pk make sense?
[13:19:01] <primitivMedia>    $('ul > li > ul > li.menu-item-has-children').not(".hovernav").after('lllll');
[13:19:04] <primitivMedia> hovernav**
[13:19:11] <primitivMedia> did I write my line of code incorrectly
[13:19:21] <on3pk> so, two errors.  First, I didn't get the async on the uploadImageBlob and the "myButton" handler was something I wrote without copying.  I should have just copied what I have.  I'm using $.when(uploadImageBlob('myId', 'canvas'))
[13:20:11] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia without seeing the related HTML, there's literally no way for us to answer that question.
[13:20:37] <robertmaxrees> on3pk so did you figure it out?
[13:21:49] <primitivMedia> ok 1 momento senor
[13:23:07] <on3pk> still trying to debug it
[13:23:07] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/YpZ3
[13:23:52] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia fix that up so it's valid html.
[13:25:08] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia also: those 'llll' strings can't be inserted where they are.
[13:25:36] <robertmaxrees> the only thing that can be a child of a UL or OL is an LI.
[13:25:58] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/SOd_
[13:26:02] <primitivMedia> iwas missing an /li sorry
[13:26:31] <on3pk> can $.ajax not go in an async function?
[13:27:10] <robertmaxrees> on3pk should be able to.  not sure though.  what version of jquery are you running?
[13:27:17] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia you were also missing a wrapping UL.
[13:27:23] <robertmaxrees> and those 'llll's are still invalid.
[13:27:39] <primitivMedia> i didnt notice the ul when i out it in my text editor weird
[13:27:56] <on3pk> 3.4
[13:27:56] <robertmaxrees> can't do </li>lllll
[13:28:08] <robertmaxrees> on3pk hrm.  can you share your code?
[13:28:48] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia so what exactly are you trying to do?
[13:30:14] <primitivMedia> add a span after the a element
[13:30:44] <robertmaxrees> which a element?
[13:31:50] <primitivMedia> one sec my js fucked up my htm l
[13:32:13] <robertmaxrees> also: why not just render the html the right way in the first place?
[13:45:06] <on3pk> robertmaxrees, ah, so, I've figured out where the error is happening.
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> go on
[13:45:41] <on3pk> In my code I have imageData = await new Promise(resolve => canvas.toBlob(resolve)); var fd = new FormData(); fd.append("blob", imageData);
[13:45:59] <on3pk> When I try to use fd with the ajax request, it breaks
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> breaks how?
[13:46:45] <on3pk> I get the illegal invocation errors
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code again?
[13:48:32] <on3pk> https://pastebin.com/VMWQKLbx
[13:48:58] <on3pk> it's even uglier than before.  I'm not calling $.when() anymore and instead just calling uploadImageBlob(...) directly
[13:49:24] <on3pk> also, pretend the strings for the urls are closed properly
[13:49:27] <robertmaxrees> you see that your code is missing quotes?
[13:49:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:50:03] <on3pk> Yeah, when I swapped out the URL for example.com I must've forgot to close them
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm real lost at this point.
[13:50:11] <robertmaxrees> can you explain what your end goal is?
[13:50:46] <on3pk> The end goal is to upload a canvas as a jpg instead of as a dataUrl
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> so what was with the $.when()?
[13:52:09] <on3pk> I was planning to do a couple different things.
[13:52:17] <on3pk> But not until I get the first thing working, I guess
[13:53:06] <robertmaxrees> one other question - why use jquery in this case instead of fetch?
[13:53:10] <on3pk> so the $.when(...) would just let me wait until everything was completed
[13:53:51] <on3pk> i have no idea what fetch is
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> modern way to do ajax calls.
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4gbfa90j/ can you flesh this out a little more?
[13:56:04] <on3pk> hm
[13:56:25] <robertmaxrees> so i can see better what you're doing.
[13:57:10] <on3pk> yeah, give me just a second
[13:59:35] <on3pk> https://jsfiddle.net/ctgvmwL6/
[13:59:53] <robertmaxrees> processData: false
[13:59:59] <robertmaxrees> add that to the ajax config object.
[14:01:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fxyus6ek/ like this.
[14:02:45] <on3pk> well
[14:03:00] <on3pk> That's a little annoying that worked.  But thanks
[14:03:12] <on3pk> Probably more confusing than it had to be
[14:04:38] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:08:19] <on3pk> I think I will look into fetch, though
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're in an environment that's relatively modern so fetch should be available.
[14:12:50] <on3pk> yeah, I don't have to worry about any of that "backwards compatibility" nonsense so might as well build for the future
[14:12:58] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[14:13:59] <on3pk> why no backwards compatibility?  It's mainly going to be used on a tablet or kiosk that I know will have the latest mobile chrome or firefox
[14:14:09] <robertmaxrees> ah, gotcha.
[14:14:55] <on3pk> Yep, got a little lucky there
[14:15:23] <robertmaxrees> I would stll be careful about too bleeding edge.
[14:15:40] <robertmaxrees> but you have native promises and whatnot available.
[14:16:04] <on3pk> well I didn't even know what fetch was.  So I'm not exactly a bleeding edge type of person
[14:16:10] <on3pk> :)
[14:17:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:17:24] <on3pk> but I will take that into consideration.  make sure things are standardized and still widely supported
[14:22:05] <on3pk> I do have another question for you.  How did you know the processData parameter was missing?  Was it experience or something about the error?
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> i googled the error.
[14:23:07] <on3pk> welp, that's embarrassing
[14:23:07] <robertmaxrees> FF's error messages are usually a little better than Chrome's imho, so i'm not sure exactly what error you were getting.
[14:23:48] <on3pk> ah.
[15:11:29] <snackoverflow> can someone look at my code and tell me why my elements in Game.creator.history are backwards? (newest values are first rather than last) https://gist.github.com/mike-johnson-jr/b9a0d4e2f1b47efff05012f6cc994374
[15:18:10] <robertmaxrees> ask in ##javascript, not really a jquery question :)
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> although, something tells me your whole lpu_index thing is off by one.
[16:56:11] <primitivMedia> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/ad5ee93a9d82c8c9a24b06606da6e222/pasted.txt
[16:56:16] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/cfez
[16:56:58] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia .carret - looks like a typo?
[16:58:15] <robertmaxrees> also - do console.log($('.mobile-active span.caret').length);
[16:58:34] <robertmaxrees> oh nevermind you've already getting help in ##javascript.  Good luck!
[16:58:35] <primitivMedia> no one is caret
[16:58:41] <primitivMedia> other is carret
[16:59:06] <primitivMedia> nobody is helping me there
[16:59:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:59:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a delegated handler, either way.
[16:59:39] <primitivMedia> ?
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:00:02] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[17:00:12] <robertmaxrees> don't just skip to the examples.  actually read about this.
[17:05:45] <primitivMedia> deletagation doesnt work i already tried using on
[17:05:55] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[17:05:58] <robertmaxrees> let me guess.
[17:06:00] <primitivMedia> oh
[17:06:02] <primitivMedia> i know why
[17:06:04] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:06:07] <primitivMedia> its looking on the dom
[17:06:10] <robertmaxrees> told you to actually read the art-
[17:06:11] <primitivMedia> i added them via js
[17:06:11] <robertmaxrees> what
[17:06:15] <robertmaxrees> dude
[17:06:19] <primitivMedia> the span i try to click
[17:06:20] <robertmaxrees> did you read the docs at all?
[17:06:24] <primitivMedia> its not html its dynamically added
[17:06:27] <robertmaxrees> right
[17:06:33] <robertmaxrees> did you read anything i just linked?
[17:07:26] <primitivMedia> part of it
[17:07:31] <robertmaxrees> read all of it.
[17:08:01] <robertmaxrees> just using .on() doesn't magically fix it.
[17:08:23] <primitivMedia> bingo
[17:08:30] <primitivMedia> got it to work
[17:08:33] <primitivMedia> thannk you  sir
[17:08:34] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:08:40] <primitivMedia>     $( "body" ).on( "click", ".mobile-active span.carret", function() {
[17:08:49] <robertmaxrees> try binding lower if you can, but yeah.
[17:08:54] <primitivMedia> lika UL?
[17:08:57] <primitivMedia> like a ul**
[17:09:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, whatever element would be the root of that "component" or whatever.
[17:09:36] <primitivMedia> component being the vspan?
[17:09:52] <robertmaxrees> "vspan"?
[17:10:26] <robertmaxrees> you do realize that since i don't have your page in front of me, right?
[17:10:35] <robertmaxrees> Like, I can't comment on that if I don't know what your markup looks like.
[17:11:29] <primitivMedia> span*
[17:11:36] <primitivMedia> li works instead of body
[17:11:55] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the LI is not a good choice, but alright.
[17:16:06] <primitivMedia> y
[17:16:33] <robertmaxrees> because that's likely not the root of the component.  but again, since i don't have any of your html in front of me, it's hard to say.
[17:17:18] <primitivMedia> define root component
[17:17:28] <robertmaxrees> root of the component
[17:17:37] <primitivMedia> ok...
[17:17:48] <robertmaxrees> the element that contains that part of the page.  like the root ul of a list of menu items.
[17:17:58] <robertmaxrees> or the article tag around the article on a page.
[17:21:40] <primitivMedia> the span is within an li
[17:21:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> good luck!
[17:22:19] <primitivMedia> so the ul would be the root component
[17:22:27] <robertmaxrees> I have literally no way of knowing.
[17:22:34] <primitivMedia> what am i looking for
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> And now I regret mentioning it.
[17:22:45] <robertmaxrees> moving on! :)
[17:23:36] <primitivMedia> you saying find the root element
[17:23:42] <primitivMedia> does not help me
[17:23:45] <primitivMedia> know what to look for
[17:23:49] <primitivMedia> im not using articles
[17:23:53] <primitivMedia> so your example is bad
[17:23:58] <robertmaxrees> if you're not going to show me your html, i cannot help.
[17:24:00] <primitivMedia> i have ul li and a span inside my li
[17:24:04] <primitivMedia> if none of those are the root
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> let's just drop the subject and move on.
[17:24:08] <primitivMedia> what do i look for from there
[17:24:09] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[17:24:14] <robertmaxrees> sorry for bringing it up.
[17:24:14] <primitivMedia> its really not hard to be clear
[17:24:17] <primitivMedia> without being vague
[17:24:24] <robertmaxrees> please drop the subject.
[17:24:25] <robertmaxrees> thanks! :)
[17:24:46] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/EprW
[17:24:50] <primitivMedia> here's my HTML or part of it
[17:25:01] <primitivMedia> thats the first UL until the end of the nav menu
[17:25:12] <primitivMedia> let me know if you want more HTML
[17:25:23] <robertmaxrees> there we go!
[17:25:28] <robertmaxrees> #menu-upper would be a good choice.
[17:26:03] <primitivMedia> why not higher?
[17:26:09] <primitivMedia> the ul has a parent element
[17:26:12] <primitivMedia> i still dont get it
[17:26:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:26:18] <primitivMedia> is it because im working inside the ulk
[17:26:19] <primitivMedia> ul?
[17:26:19] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:26:21] <robertmaxrees> moving on.
[17:26:22] <primitivMedia> does that make it the root
[17:26:24] <robertmaxrees> giving up.  drop it.
[17:26:48] <primitivMedia> ok so i give you code, but because the words that are coming out of my mouth are not the ones you want to hear, we need to drop the subject?
[17:26:53] <primitivMedia> thats nice dude
[17:27:18] <primitivMedia> thanks for the previous help, clearly you have no intention on explaining the root component without being vague
[17:27:23] <primitivMedia> so have a nice night
