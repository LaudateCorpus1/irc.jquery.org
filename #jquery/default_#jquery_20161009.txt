[03:27:29] <ldlework> I'm using $getScript(url, handler) and handler uses a function in the downloaded script, but I get a ReferenceError
[03:27:43] <ldlework> Isn't the whole point of the handler that the script has been executed?
[03:27:56] <ldlework> the script defines a function like `foo = function() { .. };`
[03:28:02] <ldlework> Any help is appreciated.
[03:28:55] <systemfault> Hmm
[03:29:02] <systemfault> It should work
[03:29:19] <systemfault> Are you sure foo isn't local to something?
[03:30:21] <ldlework> yeah
[03:30:28] <ldlework> https://github.com/lojban/diskord-zifpau/blob/master/pencu/lumci.js

[03:35:52] <ldlework> strange.

[10:26:09] <Nexus> quick question, is there any harm in doing this? $($(htmlElement))?
[12:17:49] <Azrael_-> hi
[12:19:29] <Azrael_-> grrr, it's evil. jquery.ui.dialog moves the object in the dom-model
[13:44:41] <iaj> Hi guys!
[13:45:06] <iaj> Does someone know of a jquery way/plugin to achieve an ebook-reader like behaviour?? As seen here: https://my.leadpages.net/marketplace/template/5847380860600320/5847361305579235/preview/html/#
[14:02:08] <arc_> that's basically just an image gallery with a picture of an ipad as the border
[14:02:34] <iaj> arc_: Oh.. hmmm.. I see.. :D
[14:02:41] <iaj> How would you achieve that?
[14:03:19] <arc_> idk, just look at what they did. it's pretty simple
[14:04:43] <arc_> basically you create the viewport with the size of one image, set it to overflow: hidden; and then make buttons that animate the images into the previous/next position
[14:09:39] <iaj> hmmm... ok
[16:11:57] <plamb_> how do you represent a negative value in jquery
[16:12:10] <plamb_> if i have var lol = 120
[16:12:13] <plamb_> is it just -lol
[16:14:40] <plamb_> oe does that update lol making it negative
[16:26:15] <plamb_> can anyone tell me why im getting
[16:26:17] <plamb_> Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[16:26:34] <plamb_> https://jsfiddle.net/ot07k5uz/1/
[16:35:19] <plamb_> anyone
[16:36:45] <plamb_> nevermind
[18:09:18] <tapith> Hi can anyone help fix this script so it doesn't duplicate the text?
[18:09:24] <tapith> http://jsfiddle.net/rEcx7/47/
[18:11:55] <decx> the hell is it supposed to do
[18:14:57] <tapith> lol
[18:15:21] <tapith> it wraps a span around half the text in a sentence
[18:15:31] <decx> why half
[18:15:43] <tapith> because thats how I want it to work
[18:16:33] <tapith> its so it can be styled differently
[18:19:29] <decx> so it might split midword?
[18:19:40] <tapith> na
[18:21:28] <tapith> span opens at start of the word and closes at the end..
[18:21:49] <tapith> if theres 4 words in the sentence it looks like this
[18:22:02] <tapith> first header <span>test wrap</span>
[18:22:21] <tapith> if theres 5 words it looks like this
[18:22:52] <tapith> first header <span>test wrap wrap</span> or first header test <span>wrap wrap</span>
[18:23:00] <tapith> don't mind when its an odd number
[18:24:30] <verax5> anyone used chartjs?
[18:25:30] <lianzinho> hey guys, I’m using a plugin which has this peace of code to handle ajax requests and calculate a wrapper outerhigh: http://pastebin.com/1UX0RaNY . The problem is that inside the incoming content is a carousel which is not being considered in the response… what should I do to solve the deferred only after the carousel is totally loaded?
[18:26:19] <z1haze> how do I get the http status code from a $.getJSON response?
[18:27:52] <shoky> jqxhr.status
[18:30:01] <decx> tapith start from string.length/2 and match for space
[18:34:59] <z1haze> shoky, well when i try to log .status of this object i get undefined https://gyazo.com/24c9558f406ce624ab0fdf183c820a38
[18:35:59] <z1haze> driving me mad
[18:36:07] <z1haze> clearly its an object i can see RIGHT THERE
[18:38:00] <z1haze> shoky, http://dpaste.com/0Z3F0R4
[18:42:08] <z1haze> guessing i need to wait for it to respond?
[18:42:11] <z1haze> but how
[18:50:05] <shoky> z1haze with a success callback
[18:50:15] <shoky> or use the promises interface
[18:50:26] <shoky> either way, with a callback
[18:50:34] <z1haze> ok but i need to return from this function
[18:50:36] <z1haze> checkAuthorized
[18:50:41] <shoky> you can't return async values.
[18:50:51] <shoky> you should know that by now ;)
[18:51:02] <z1haze> well how can i wait til i get a response to return from checkAuthorized then
[18:51:14] <z1haze> still learning, every day
[18:51:15] <shoky> you can make checkAuthorized return a promise
[18:51:18] <shoky> for example
[18:51:37] <shoky> well it already does cause a jqxhr is also a promise
[18:51:50] <shoky> authCheck.done(...).fail(...)
[18:52:12] <shoky> the ... are callbacks you provide
[18:53:36] <z1haze> so i can keep var authCheck = Authorization.checkAuthorized(); and below that do authCheck.done() ?
[18:54:08] <z1haze> and i guess .done returns the data if its a 200, and .fail is when its a +400?
[18:57:38] <z1haze> got it shoky thanks dude
[19:02:43] <tapith> decx - i'm not sure how to do that..!
[19:05:29] <decx> eh something like that http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rEcx7/49/
[19:06:24] <tapith> ah sweet!!
[19:07:31] <tapith> perfect! thanks!
[20:02:46] <plamb_> anyone around
[20:04:29] <plamb_> how do you initiate and array with KV pairs and make the keys from a previous variable instead of a string?
[20:06:57] <plamb_> for example
[20:07:05] <plamb_> here my keys just end up being "itemID"
[20:07:07] <plamb_> http://pastebin.com/i07L91Gs
[20:13:30] <shoky> kv pairs in js is an object, not array.  var obj = {};  obj[itemID] = foo;
[20:14:16] <shoky> or in modern browsers - var obj = {[itemID]: foo}
[23:04:41] <plamb_> shoky you there
[23:08:12] <plamb_> i tried to create it like this
[23:08:14] <plamb_> http://pastebin.com/nQRfuzjE
[23:08:54] <plamb_> itemID is returning '2' in console.log but 'null' in the data structure
[23:15:18] <plamb_> seemed to be because i was using [] instead of {}
