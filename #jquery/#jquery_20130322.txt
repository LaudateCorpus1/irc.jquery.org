[01:18:18] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/XcmXs/6/ - how do I launch jQuery Mobile's sidepanel when hovering the left edge of the screen? (trying to make it more usable for desktops)
[01:22:20] <SP33D> hello my frinds does any one know a thing i could use to identify the device a user is using?

[01:51:35] <superdo> hi, can I do nested $.post-s?
[01:54:51] <greek> Hi fellas. I have a popup div that gets displayed when I click on an input field. I'd like to hide it when the mouse is clicked anywhere outside that div (kinda like the jquery-ui date picker popup). What's the best way to achieve this "if click anywhere else then close this popup" functionality? Thanks :)
[01:59:08] <chxane> greek, mouseleave possibly but won't be triggered on clicking just when the mouse pointer leaves that area
[02:01:13] <mhn23> learning js atm. anybody can recommend live updating code editor?
[02:01:29] <chxane> mhn23, jsfiddle
[02:02:01] <mhn23> mh i hope more as a desktop version
[02:02:34] <mhn23> but i assume i have to take whats there.
[02:02:35] <faraway> i recently migrated a site to jquer-ui 1.10 , before that version i could select a tab with .tabs("select","tab-anchor-id"); â€¦ i already know that i have to use "active" with an index now, but doing it this way seems to be a little bit complicated: tabElement.tabs("option","active", tabElement.find("[aria-controls='"+selected+"']").prevAll().length );
[02:02:43] <chxane> can't help there mhn23 sorry
[02:03:28] <faraway> is there a better way to get the index form the anchor ?
[02:06:12] <faraway> mhn23: you mean an application, or would a local installable jsfiddle like webapplication also be ok?
[02:06:59] <mhn23> well i hope something like:save something in my editor and it gets pushed to my browser
[02:07:33] <mhn23> so i see whats going on instantly
[02:09:04] <mhn23> greek: btw i would wrap the centered div in a wrapper div that is height and width 100% and on click hide it
[02:09:41] <greek> mhn23, genius.
[02:12:11] <faraway> mhn23: well many editors are able to define a build scripts or actions, where you e.g. could trigger to open a defined url instead of compiling something. if you are looking for something like jsfiddle but installed locally on your own webserver you could try to install jsbin (https://github.com/remy/jsbin/) but to be honest , i never tried that ;)
[02:24:26] <Joey___> Could anyone help me out getting something figured out? I'd like to have a link activate a dropdown menu on the top of the page(and automaticly snap to it).
[02:24:52] <Joey___> Is this possible?
[02:28:02] <faraway> Joey___: what do you mean with snap to the dropdown menu ?
[02:28:25] <Joey___> The actual link that opens the dropdown is at the top of the page.
[02:29:00] <Joey___> But I want a link at the bottom that toggles this dropdown and scrolls the page up so you actually see it.
[02:30:52] <mhn23> uh you can do this.. but i can tell you it's not a good user experience
[02:32:00] <Joey___> What would you suggest?
[02:32:20] <mhn23> nobody wants to click a link of at the bottom of a page-> gets scrolled all the way up -> just to see a fkng drop down menu.
[02:32:27] <mhn23> what are you trying to achieve with it?
[02:33:35] <Joey___> In my footer I have a link that says project, but there is no project page.
[02:34:01] <Joey___> The project link at the top is just a simple hover link that shows the list of projects.
[02:35:10] <boytoy> Joey___: sounds like u dont really need tha link in the footer?
[02:35:14] <boytoy> forgive me if im wrong
[02:35:21] <greek> mhn23, is that how datepicker does it?
[02:35:40] <mhn23> greek: no idea but i assume fb does it like that
[02:35:53] <mhn23> greek: as i said i'm new but thats how i would try it
[02:36:16] <mhn23> Joey___: yeah it seems it shouldn't be there. the drop down should speak for it self.
[02:36:36] <mhn23> Joey___: also if you REALLY want that link there create a portfolio page
[02:36:41] <Joey___> The link in the footer is important though, I'd like to have it toggle the submenu of the project link.
[02:37:41] <Joey___> The reason I want it like this is because I want to keep the footer small, so I don't want to put the actual sub-menu of projects in the footer.
[02:38:04] <mhn23> Joey___: so the guy who clicked it, lets assume he clicked it because of interest or curious what you did, wants to see more
[02:38:40] <mhn23> Joey___: so if they have a base of interest showcase your work. use images to visualize and let them get an idea of your work
[02:38:43] <boytoy> Joey___: you could always do progressive disclosure i.e. with hoverintent, but really i think that kinda stuff belongs in the header
[02:38:51] <mhn23> Joey___: a simple list seems to be not effictive
[02:39:18] <boytoy> Joey___: http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/index.html is a great design guide even if you dont design for mobile
[02:41:44] <faraway> greek: i think datepicker listens for click on window,document or body (not sure about which one right now) and on the datepicker widget it self. in the datepicker click callback stopPropagation  is called on the event  so that the event does not bubble up the dom. and in the other callback the datepicker is closed.
[02:41:57] <Joey___> I'll look into it.
[02:42:04] <Joey___> Thanks for the suggestions all.
[02:42:16] <greek> faraway thanks for the insight
[02:47:43] <faraway> greek: it depends on what you want to do. if you want the closing to be the only action you would use a div so that the click is cached by it. if you want a button, input or other ui to do their default action for that click , you would use the approach with stopPropagation. but you need to keep in mind that with the stopPropagation some other callback could  interfere and prevent the widget form closing.
[02:53:59] <mhn23> just inspected it. fb does create a div
[02:55:14] <Mr_Grim> i am trying to clone a table row which I can do but im also trying to change the id's in the table for all elements
[02:55:30] <Mr_Grim> looking online at ways to do this, still having a touch time figuring it out
[02:57:39] <alexut> noob question: if i have a class on multiple buttons how i identify the specifcally one that has been clicked to create a function ?
[03:02:39] <faraway> alexut: well you could add an attribute like " data-action='save'  " to the button which you check on click are use additionally as selector? without knowing how the html code of the buttons looks it is not possible to tell
[03:03:15] <faraway> alexut: â€¦ or use additionally as selector! â€¦.
[03:05:23] <iksik> hello, i've got a part of html: <div><a ...>foo <span>bar</span></a></div> - and selector: $('div a').text(); how can i fix it to get only 'foo' without content of any tags inside of 'a'?
[03:07:03] <Mr_Grim> hi guys, I am trying to modify a span tag in each table row like? $("table tr:last").clone().each(function(index, value) { $(this).find('.table_number').text('5'); }).end().appendTo("table");
[03:07:14] <Mr_Grim> the span tag has a class called .table_number
[03:07:17] <Mr_Grim> cant seem to get it to work
[03:07:25] <Mr_Grim> just want to set the table number to  5 each time
[03:07:26] <Mr_Grim> what gives?
[03:09:38] <shmoon> is this jquery's own implementation ? http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/ ?
[03:19:10] <troop> hi, ajax request returns 404 but this code was running properly last night, today it does not work? i'm using easyphp in windows 7
[03:20:30] <ankr> troop, does not sound like a jquery issue.

[03:25:02] <peterschmidler> How can I remove $(window).focus(function()
[03:27:29] <peterschmidler> Anyone?
[03:28:08] <ravenzz> ?off @ peterschmidler
[03:28:31] <bot-t> peterschmidler, .off() | jQuery API Documentation - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[03:28:35] <peterschmidler> $('windows).unbind('focus') ? Maybe?
[03:29:03] <sacho> shmoon, what do you mean?
[03:29:14] <peterschmidler> $('windows).off('focus') ???
[03:29:27] <ravenzz> yes
[03:29:32] <Cork> ya, off or unbind is the oposite of .focus
[03:30:11] <peterschmidler> What's the difference between off and unbind?
[03:30:21] <Cork> off can handle delegated events
[03:30:44] <Cork> unbind is for plain bind events only (.foucus is a short for bind('focus') )
[03:31:34] <Cork> so basically unbind and bind is a legacy name for on/off
[03:31:37] <ravenzz> probably recent version of jQuery it is a short for on()
[03:32:40] <Cork> uh actualyl off/on in respective order :)
[03:33:14] <dawncold> hey, I just using jQuery1.8.2, and I use $.ajax(POST), but I got an error, it said 'No Transport', but I just post to one part of my site, the action field of my form is '/shopping-cart/item', AND, only find this issue in IE6....anyone can help me ???
[03:34:02] <Cork> dawncold: what do you mean by ajax(POST) ?
[03:34:17] <Cork> is POST a variable you have?
[03:34:54] <dawncold> Cork: the type of $.ajax
[03:35:19] <Cork> so $.ajax({ url: '', type: 'post', ... }) ?
[03:35:30] <dawncold> Cork: yeah
[03:36:09] <Cork> dawncold: is it getting to the server or does it fail before that?
[03:36:44] <dawncold> no data to server...
[03:36:55] <Cork> ok can you try reproducing it on jsfiddle?
[03:36:57] <peterschmidler> Cork: Thanks!
[03:37:14] <Cork> there is a /echo/html or /echo/json you can use to test ajax calls
[03:37:23] <Cork> peterschmidler: np
[03:37:51] <dawncold> Cork: ok,I try it
[03:38:54] <sacho> no transport is a jquery error, before the request is executed
[03:39:07] <sacho> dawncold, what does your code look like?
[03:39:32] <dawncold> sacho: which part?
[03:39:39] <sacho> the ajax call
[03:40:10] <sacho> and relevant parameters
[03:40:31] <dawncold> sacho: like this,
[03:40:31] <dawncold> var _ = {
[03:40:31] <dawncold>         type:'POST',
[03:40:31] <dawncold>         url:url,
[03:40:31] <dawncold>         data:data,
[03:40:31] <dawncold>         async:async,
[03:40:31] <dawncold>         dataType:dataType,
[03:40:32] <dawncold>         success:onSuccess,
[03:40:32] <dawncold>         error:onError,
[03:40:33] <dawncold>         statusCode:{
[03:40:33] <dawncold>             400:onValidationError,
[03:40:34] <dawncold>             403:function() {alert('no permission');}
[03:40:44] <Cork> dawncold: don't dump code in the channel
[03:40:46] <sacho> please use a paste service next time
[03:41:19] <dawncold> sacho: ok, that my first time ...paste to irc
[03:42:42] <benjick> Anyone replicated the google image search onclick thingy in jquery?
[03:42:48] <dawncold> sacho: like this,http://pastebin.com/jKRZrfBu
[03:43:07] <sacho> yes, but the values of those parameters?
[03:44:06] <peiper> hi folks, im a little dumb right now, i applied an .on('click' handler on a table, how do i set specific css stuff to those elements? I've duplicated the handler and replaced the event with "load" and "ready" but both are not firing when they should
[03:44:37] <peiper> td are getting loaded and refreshed on the fly
[03:45:36] <dawncold> sacho: http://pastebin.com/pAf7AnUa
[03:45:55] <dawncold> sacho: the widget is my form
[03:46:42] <shmoon> sacho: i mean why does jquery's documentation document that ? when it is available as native DOM method on the event object (as i see in MDN)
[03:48:37] <sacho> shmoon, I don't know the native support for it is, yes the jquery documentation does document it(after all, you linked to the documentation) - it only works on events registered via jquery though.
[03:48:39] <dawncold> Cork: I think I can only reproduct this issue in IE6, and the IE6 env in IETester works fine...
[03:48:46] <sacho> on event handlers*
[03:49:11] <Cork> dawncold: can you reproduce it with a slimmed down testcase?
[03:49:23] <Cork> it would really help if there was a small running example
[03:49:30] <shmoon> ok since the event object is usually the native event object jquery implements its own version of stopImmediatePropagation on that?
[03:49:30] <sacho> if possible, with *actual values* for url and async :)
[03:49:39] <sacho> shmoon, yes
[03:49:57] <sacho> shmoon, you're looking at the documentation for jquery event objects, not native ones.
[03:49:58] <shmoon> ok thats what i wanted to ask, so its jquery' version for better browser support i suppose, thanks
[03:50:03] <shmoon> oh ?
[03:50:24] <Cork> shmoon: its a compatibility layer
[03:50:38] <Cork> its to ex. target exists in all browsers
[03:50:45] <shmoon> when you bind cliuck event through jquery the event object that you get is not the native browser event object?
[03:50:55] <sacho> no
[03:51:06] <shmoon> hm
[03:51:36] <sacho> event.originalEvent is
[03:51:54] <shmoon> ok got it thanks
[03:52:56] <dawncold> sacho: do you have any ideas about that codeï¼Ÿ
[03:53:15] <sacho> not really, the error depends on the exact values of the parameters
[03:53:29] <sacho> jquery only provides two default transports, one for script, and one through xmlhttprequest
[03:54:14] <sacho> so most likely xmlhttprequest is failing for some reason.
[03:54:31] <sacho> perhaps because ie6's settings don't allow its usage?
[03:55:29] <dawncold> sacho: it works fine before few weeks ago, but today we deploy it to production, and got some feedback
[03:56:03] <dawncold> sacho: I just test using IE6,find this
[03:57:26] <dawncold> sacho: I invoked createResource like this:veil.widget.createResource(widget, function (html){location.href = html;});
[03:58:07] <Zepo> Hey, can someone tell me why this snippet does not actuale change the values in #lieferant ? http://codetidy.com/5031/
[03:58:14] <Zepo> actually*
[03:58:24] <Mo9a7i> I have a codeigniter application with load more (twitter-like) functionality and inline edit (x-editible) problem is, i can't do inline edits with newly added posts from the load more function.
[03:58:44] <dawncold> sacho: I don't pass any value to datetype and data defined in my js file
[03:58:58] <Mo9a7i> Is there a way i can refresh Document ready function call after each (load-more)
[04:22:26] <Olivius67> How can I detect that a user has switched on or off full screen?
[04:23:06] <Cork> Olivius67: you mean the requestFullscreen?
[04:24:10] <Olivius67> well to be complete I'm actualy playing with this indeed
[04:24:12] <Olivius67> however
[04:24:43] <Olivius67> I'm using this mini pluggin: https://github.com/kayahr/jquery-fullscreen-plugin/
[04:24:45] <Olivius67> however
[04:25:21] <Olivius67> the $(document).bind("fullscreenchange", function() {..} function does not detects when the fullscreen is requested by the user pressing f11 for instance
[04:26:05] <Cork> .g mdn fullscreenchange
[04:26:06] <b-ot> Cork: fullscreenchange - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/fullscreenchange
[04:26:39] <Cork> hmm looks like that should work
[04:27:05] <Cork> though it does add its own triggers
[04:27:19] <Cork> Olivius67: have you tried without the plugin?
[04:27:38] <Olivius67> actually no
[04:28:05] <Olivius67> will try the mozzila provided cod for a test
[04:28:31] <Cork> Olivius67: it might be that the event emulator might break things
[04:28:51] <Cork> as it actually creates the emulation even when the browser doesn't have prefixes
[04:28:59] <Cork> and ... that sounds like it might break
[04:29:56] <Olivius67> just tried the mozzila code
[04:30:02] <Olivius67> it doesn't work on f11
[04:34:17] <Cork> Olivius67: this one works for me http://fiddle.jshell.net/zNve5/1/show/
[04:34:36] <Siver> Hi, how do I provide a callback for jquery ui ajax tabs? I can't get it to work through ajaxOptions for some reason ...
[04:35:00] <Cork> Olivius67: and this one works in webkit http://fiddle.jshell.net/zNve5/2/show/
[04:36:20] <WHTM> Hi, could someone check my code for me please, I have a variable which is resetting itself and I'm not sure why
[04:36:42] <WHTM> http://pastebin.com/rES3FAPR
[04:36:59] <WHTM> the variable is prevPage
[04:37:41] <wodim> hi, how does $('#elementa', '#elementb') work? matches all #elementa inside #elementb? where is that documented?
[04:37:43] <Cork> WHTM: remove VAR in the sub event handlers if you want them to share the variable
[04:38:12] <Cork> wodim: ya, though you wrote it as id's and those are page uniq
[04:38:22] <Cork> so for that exact example its not valid
[04:38:30] <wodim> imagine i used . instead of #
[04:38:42] <wodim> but is that documented anywhere?
[04:38:44] <Cork> $('.class_name', '#elementb') would grab all class_name elements inside #elementb
[04:39:12] <Cork> its the same thing as $('#elementb').find('.class_name')
[04:39:25] <Cork> there is a few overloaded features in $()
[04:40:13] <Cork> personally i prefer $().find() i find clearer to read
[04:41:15] <wodim> i understand, this is no my code tho :-)
[04:41:49] <Cork> theres also things like $('<div/>', { title: 'something', class: 'other' }) and so on
[04:41:54] <Cork> and a lot of other things
[04:42:05] <WHTM> Cork: Sweet, thanks
[04:58:34] <Olivius67> Cork: http://fiddle.jshell.net/zNve5/1/show/ => works indeed when you enter fullscreen using the button and exit it with f11, you get the alert
[04:59:12] <Olivius67> however, when you enter full screen using f11 instead of the button you don't get any enter or leave allert
[04:59:26] <Cork> f11 isn't the same fullscreen
[05:00:18] <Cork> f11 is the browser fullscreen, the page can request to put an element on the page as fullscreen
[05:00:38] <Cork> you only get events if you've used he requestFullScreen (and it's been allowed)
[05:01:03] <Olivius67> i see
[05:01:41] <Olivius67> I will then just ignore if the user use f11
[05:01:51] <Olivius67> although that pisses me off ;-)
[05:02:14] <Olivius67> hummm... do you think it's possible to disable the browser fullscreen capability
[05:02:15] <Olivius67> ?
[05:03:08] <Olivius67> or redirect the keypress event to requestfullscreen?
[05:03:19] <Olivius67> not sure the browser allows that
[05:03:29] <Olivius67> got to try
[05:03:43] <Cork> quite sure it won't
[05:07:28] <Olivius67> if (e.keyCode == 122) e.preventDefault(); => disable switching to fullscreen
[05:07:31] <Olivius67> at least on ff
[05:07:51] <Cork> and it can actually override the built in fullscreen??
[05:07:54] <Cork> scary...
[05:08:00] <Olivius67> yes
[05:08:33] <Olivius67> that may be "fixed" in later versions
[05:08:59] <Olivius67> works on chroms as well
[05:12:50] <dawncold> Cork: hi
[05:13:12] <dawncold> Cork: the issue I told you , http://jsbin.com/ireko3
[05:13:32] <dawncold> Cork: You can try it in IE6
[05:14:27] <Cork> dawncold: text isn't a supported dataType
[05:14:55] * Cork boots his ie6 vm
[05:15:25] <Cork> dawncold: can you reproduce the problem if you replace text with html?
[05:15:50] <dawncold> Cork: If I don't pass any value to dataType?which type jquery will choose?
[05:16:03] <Cork> the type the server sends
[05:16:18] <Cork> (and quite often it will use that either way)
[05:17:07] <Cork> dawncold: actually that jsbin works in ie6
[05:17:21] <dawncold> Cork: I tried it by replacing text to html, it doesn't work
[05:17:40] <Cork> ya, like i said, that jsbin works for me in ie6
[05:17:45] <Cork> just as it is
[05:18:55] <dawncold> Cork: I only got 'error, status = error, error = No Transport'
[05:19:29] <Cork> have you checked so your jquery isn't broken?
[05:19:57] <Cork> and you do get the error on the jsbin example?
[05:21:25] <dawncold> Cork: yeah, we use the same jsbin version
[05:21:38] <Cork> weird
[05:22:00] <Cork> have you checked if theres something with your ie6 settings?
[05:22:10] <Cork> (this one uses xp default settings)
[05:23:36] <dawncold> Cork: I will restore default setting of IE6
[05:24:53] <dawncold> Cork: I have restored the settings...and the result always No Transport
[05:25:02] <Cork> weird
[05:26:10] <dawncold> Cork: :-(
[05:33:02] <dawncold> Cork: hey, have you used IETester?
[05:33:20] <Cork> ya, stopped using it ages ago cause it wasn't dependable
[05:33:35] <dawncold> Cork: the IE6 in IETester works fine...
[05:33:49] <Cork> ya, same with mine here
[05:34:00] <Cork> so i start to wonder if its something with the ie installation you have
[05:35:39] <dawncold> Cork: this IE6 is installed in one Vmware, and I just test some pages...I think it is a pure version
[05:36:21] <Cork> dawncold: ya, not sure how i would be able to help
[05:36:27] <Cork> works fine here
[05:39:00] <dawncold> Cork: ok,thanks, I will test this issue in my friends' computer
[05:40:13] <dawncold> Cork: Can you help me to click this button,that's my production env, http://www.lijiababy.com.cn/product/821
[05:40:29] <dawncold> Cork: use your IE6,
[05:41:04] <dawncold> Cork: Just click the Button behine the quality input
[05:42:07] <dawncold> Cork: If jump to another page ,it works fine
[05:42:21] <Cork> nope doens't
[05:42:32] <Cork> don't see any errors either though
[05:43:10] <Cork> dawncold: though honestly, why care about ie6?
[05:43:28] <Cork> not even microsoft is supporting it anymore
[05:43:47] <dawncold> Cork: I don't want care IE6,but...
[05:44:14] <dawncold> Cork: If you know the GA
[05:44:36] <Cork> you still have high numbers?
[05:45:03] <dawncold> Cork: the IE6's usage is very hige
[05:45:12] <dawncold> Cork: high
[05:45:15] <Cork> ouch, that sucks
[05:45:41] <Cork> we'r almost clean of < ie8 now days
[05:45:56] <dawncold> Cork: ok, fuck the IE6:)
[05:46:14] <Cork> dawncold: if its high number you don't really have a choice :/
[05:47:15] <dawncold> Cork: we just gurgantee the main process is success in IE6
[05:59:55] <davidw> I have an accordion that I want to manually accordionize... so far so good.  However, I'd like it to not fire its events when it gets called that way... is there a good pattern for this?
[06:00:11] <davidw> other than dont_fire_events = true; doAccordionStuff(); dont_fire_events = false
[06:00:40] <Zepo> Hmm
[06:01:33] <Zepo> Someone know how I can print the "link" ajax uses http://codetidy.com/5031/ here ?
[06:03:16] <Cork> Zepo: you mean the url in the ajax call?
[06:04:55] <Zepo> Cork: Yep
[06:05:29] <Cork> Zepo: as far as i know its not exposed; save it in a variable and then user the variable in the call
[06:06:08] <Zepo> Cork: Meh :| I printed out all variable's and they are right, the problem is the ufd-plugin currently that does not like to change my options
[06:08:16] <Grundell_> So im new to ajax and wondered if i have a onEvent click show content, and want to import this content by ajax (a php file) how do i do this ?
[06:08:39] <AdamPDotty> hmm, how do I get a broken gif on jsfiddle.net?
[06:09:31] <Cork> AdamPDotty: jsfiddle doesn't host media, you would have to grab that from third party
[06:14:16] <AdamPDotty> I am trying to test the error event (for an image). It works on linux, but not on windows (various browsers) and not in a fiddle.
[06:32:34] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/XcmXs/10/ - trying to make this jQuery Mobile side panel more usable on desktop by opening it when the user moves her cursor to the left edge of the screen - and closing it otherwise. Why ain't it working though?
[06:33:44] * boytoy is making all his desktop stuff look just like mobile :P
[06:38:07] <mhn23> boytoy: i won't recommend that
[06:39:30] <mhn23> boytoy: ppl move the cursor often after they clicked the link, like me, so it doesn't block the text
[06:39:55] <seutje> nothing more annoying than have UI elements of an iphone on my <insert pretty much any device that isn't an iphone>
[06:40:23] <mhn23> ^
[06:55:25] <fission6> i am writing a bookmarklet, i want to add some html to a small ajax response triggered by a hover over on a page, is there a way to modify an ajax response before it hits its callback
[06:59:15] <Andrew_R> fission6: take a look at http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/ and see if that will work for you
[06:59:30] <fission6> ok i am looking at ajaxComplete right now
[06:59:38] <fission6> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[06:59:42] <fission6> whats the difference
[06:59:55] <fission6> and does this pick up on ajax initiated from other js code on the page
[07:03:38] <basiclaser> hey guys how do we access local device time in javascript ? any examples or tutorials would be appreciated :)
[07:03:49] <Mottie> fission6: ajaxComplete is called when the ajax was a success or failed, ajaxSuccess is only called on success... and it will only pick up jQuery initiated ajax calls, as far as I know
[07:04:22] <Mottie> basiclaser: use new Date()?
[07:05:10] <fission6> Mottie i think you are correct about the last part - anyway to capture ajax events in a similar fashion that may have been initiated outside of jquery
[07:05:58] <docker> hi, can anyone help me with this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KhotJ
[07:06:11] <docker> the remove portion does not work
[07:08:58] <Mottie> docker: try "}, 2000, function(){ $(this).remove(); })"
[07:09:43] <seutje> docker: also, don't re-run the selector
[07:10:02] <seutje> u can just $('<div class="growing_circle"></div>').appendTo($('.countryXY')).animate({ ... })
[07:10:45] <Mottie> seutje: or better yet, assign a variable to $('.countryXY')
[07:11:46] <seutje> yeah, but then u might as well make the whole thing instanciable, no?
[07:12:15] <seutje> so u could new growingCircle(interval, raduis); or something
[07:12:29] <seutje> or maybe that a bit over-abstracted
[07:13:17] <Mottie> Honestly, I'd just use pure css3 for that animation
[07:14:02] <seutje> yeah, and use transforms so the bounding box isn't affected and you don't have to do awkward positioning
[07:14:48] <docker> Mottie: interesting... but I need to animate on request
[07:14:56] <docker> it wont be continious
[07:15:47] <docker> see it that way - every time the value in the circle changes - the same amount of animatingCircles will be released
[07:16:18] <docker> do you think this can be handled by css alone?
[07:16:34] <BillCriswell> docker: You can add and remove a class.
[07:19:24] <docker> BillCriswell: the interval between the animations will also change depending on the number in circle. I can only imagine some complicated css/js mix to accomplish that
[07:22:57] <BillCriswell> docker: Ah, true.
[07:24:09] <amereservant> Hey everyone, I'm a bit stumped on how to add methods to an object, such as in this example: http://blog.amitagrwal.com/adding-methods-to-dom-elements
[07:24:15] <amereservant> Here's my test case: http://jsfiddle.net/amereservant/B87uS/
[07:24:38] <seutje> docker: yeah, sounds like that would require a rather complicated sass loop and then still need a tiny bit of JS
[07:26:02] <docker> thank you Mottie, seutje, BillCriswell ! Very much appreciated! ( works here http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KhotJ )
[07:27:11] <BillCriswell> This just reminded me of something I wanted to try.
[07:27:33] <seutje> amereservant: $.fn is like the prototype for jquery-wrapped DOM elements, so u'd need ur methods on that object
[07:27:53] <seutje> amereservant: your current implementation just defines some function in the scope of the statusMsg method
[07:28:46] <seutje> amereservant: also, $.fn function are called with this bound to a jquery collection, so no need to wrap it in $()
[07:29:02] <seutje> amereservant: and you prolly want your method to return this, to preserve chaining
[07:31:05] <Mottie> docker: I threw this together http://codepen.io/Mottie/pen/gihqd ... probably be hard to scale to different sizes without javascript, but it's a start :P
[07:35:58] <Wolfed> So .toggle('slow') seems to change my selector into a block. Is there any way to avoid so?
[07:36:14] <lmao2> <a id="Words" href="/wall-of-words/Words" rel="1">Words<div class="popup"><ul></ul></div></a>  How do i the text value of <a> (words) if i'm querying .popup ul
[07:36:30] <lmao2> parents() ?
[07:37:54] <lmao2> $('.words a .popup ul').parents().parents().not('div, body, html').text() works but not the most ideal way..
[07:38:04] <amereservant> seutje, Thanks!  What's the best way to attach all three methods to the object without creating three separate $.fn.... functions?
[07:38:21] <seutje> $.extend
[07:39:34] <seutje> amereservant: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Namespacing
[07:41:15] <seutje> amereservant: also, http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/ is an interesting read regarding plugin authoring
[07:41:27] <seutje> especially the 3rd code block
[07:41:40] <seutje> shows how to use extend to define multiple methods on $.fn
[07:42:07] <seutje> the link from docs.jquery.com shows how to have multiple methods within a single plugin
[07:42:35] <amereservant> seutje, Thank you very much!  That's EXACTLY what I needed to find.
[07:42:41] <seutje> but the smashingmag article also shows how to create a plugin that uses an instanciable function
[07:43:06] <seutje> np, thank the guys who wrote it and google for helping me find it :P
[08:05:49] <esas> is there a specific way to cast a variable to int, or do you just do *1?
[08:06:13] <aMoniker> esas: +variable
[08:06:38] <aMoniker> well, if you specifically want an int you can use parseInt()
[08:07:44] <esas> oh, thanks :)

[08:38:39] <uArch> gretz ppl. I was wondering.. I have a .mousewheel call that happens beyond the User input (comulative scroll I guess...) but I want only to triger one call and do not listing for any more event while a function is working (in my case, while images are swamping in the screen). Can anyone give me some sort of idea on how to achieve this? I'm a newbe... guess..
[08:39:19] <DarsVaeda> if I do "$('#foo').on('click', 'div div a'...)" is there an easier way to get the main parent other than $(this).parent().parent()
[08:39:44] <djQuery> DarsVaeda, see ?closest

[09:29:52] <SirSkitzo> How does one set input#id_name:valid to true with jquery/javascript? I have a confirm pass field that runs oninput="checkPass(document.getElementById('pass1'), this)" and I don't know how to set valid to true if it passes.
[09:32:27] <djQuery> SirSkitzo, dont think there is a way to do it the way that you are trying http://www.the-art-of-web.com/javascript/validate-password/#.UUyHcnE-tO8
[09:33:06] <veQue> what prevents a website from taking any file from your computer?
[09:33:08] <veQue> like when you upload to a site?
[09:33:10] <veQue> for the sake of argument if it knew your file structure couldn't it just change the path right before upload?
[09:33:27] <SirSkitzo> djQuery: Oh, cool. All I have to do is return true?
[09:33:43] <veQue> just curious, i don't know much about how those things work obviously
[09:34:17] <djQuery> veQue, give it a try
[09:34:37] <JAAulde> Hi folks. Does anyone know what jQuery UI's doc are intending to say when they says "cancel an event". For example, http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select says "Canceling this event prevents the value from being updated...". I know returnng false works to do this, but is there any method of the passed in event object which UI would consider to have "canceled" (is preventDefault() the same as canceling, or would this require stopPr
[09:34:37] <JAAulde> opogation() ?). THANKS!
[09:34:48] <veQue> djQuery:  oh?
[09:35:03] <shoelessone> Anybody have any recomendations for simple/ligthweight plugins (similar to Cycle) for making little "switchers" for switching between news ticket articles, etc
[09:35:19] <veQue> from your response seems like it might be protection against this sorta thing?
[09:36:17] <djQuery> veQue, to tell the truth I have never tried but would hope most browsers would take this into consideration
[09:37:06] <topriddy> i am generating a list of dynamic links and i want to bind their onclick events to javascript.

[09:41:10] <pi3r> s/I/hi ..
[09:41:31] <tbranyen> obj.id = obj.id()
[09:42:00] <pi3r> tbranyen: but something generic like myObject.toHash()
[09:42:22] <thinced> pi3r: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:42:57] <thinced> pi3r: as I remember it can also serialize objects
[09:44:12] <topriddy> It is generally customary to place binding jquery functions on document load yes???
[09:45:02] <pi3r> thinced: hum, are you sure? The doc says it returns a string
[09:46:18] <pi3r> topriddy: it depends on what you need
[09:47:35] <topriddy> pi3r: say i want to bind a select option on change event
[09:47:50] <topriddy> pi3r: i am doing it inside here: $(document).ready(function() {
[09:48:54] <pi3r> topriddy: If the bind is at the bottom of the body, I don't think you need the ready\

[09:49:45] <topriddy> pi3r: secondly please, I am having to generate a list of items from db, with an action link...i want on click of link to pass database id. but i dont know how to bind to function...should i be doing something like: <a href="" onclick="serviceItem(${row.id})"/>
[09:50:11] <topriddy> pi3r: but it doesnt matter if i still put it on ready? what is the syntax that doesnt have ready?
[09:53:32] <Ingo2> Hi, i am new Jquery newbie and iÂ´d like to know if someone knows this book and tell me if its any good to enter the Jquery world: http://t.co/XNq6bNtkfU
[09:55:42] <yogurt_truck> I don't see the point in buying a jquery book, let alone one from 2011
[09:55:52] <NoiseEee> Ingo2: tbh i'd stay away from books for a bit because its always changing, and 2.0 is on the  way in
[09:55:54] <yogurt_truck> if you're a JS newbie, learn JS. then learn jquery from its docs, etc.
[09:56:04] <hugo_moss> hi for some reason, im using the lazy load script and the css animation flickers im using fadeIn
[10:02:41] <vacho> I am trying to get the markup that's within a class.. can I do do this? jQuery(this).find('.org-chart-modal-view').html()
[10:04:54] <Darsain> how smart it is to do $(document).on('mouseenter', 'selector', fn) performance wise?
[10:05:44] <NoiseEee> Darsain: not appealing at all
[10:05:45] <sacho> depends what you want to achieve
[10:06:29] <Darsain> display tooltip if someone mouseenters "[data-tooltip]" item
[10:06:52] <NoiseEee> Darsain: and those tooltips can be virtually anywhere in the document?
[10:08:17] <sacho> Darsain, you're weighing the maintainability and memory usage of adding x listeners to each of your elements(or their containers), vs having one that will trigger all the time.
[10:08:26] <sacho> Darsain, why can't you use containers closer to the source?
[10:08:27] <Darsain> NoiseEee: is that relevant? the issue is the type of event delegation for "mouseenter" described above. I suspect that it is pretty inneficient way how to do it, but I dunno :)
[10:08:36] <sacho> it is.
[10:08:57] <sacho> any mousenter event will eventually be handled by document.
[10:09:02] <sacho> delegation isn't magic :)
[10:09:16] <NoiseEee> Darsain: personally, i'd rather set up a couple $('#help').on('mouseenter',function() { //tooltips for this help section }); if there are only a few areas
[10:09:24] <sacho> it'll check if the element source matches your given selector, and ignore it if it doesn't
[10:10:10] <Darsain> yeah. but it triggers all the time, no? or how does the jquery do mouseenter event? catches mousemove and figgures out whether shit happened?
[10:10:25] * sacho points up.
[10:10:33] <NoiseEee> every single element on the page would fire the event when moused over, Darsain
[10:10:56] <Darsain> NoiseEee: I know. that's why I'm discussing the performance of that
[10:11:52] <Darsain> I guess I'll go with event listener for each tooltip triggering element
[10:13:04] <NoiseEee> Darsain: or just event delegation that isn't quite so far-reaching, if possible
[10:13:37] <Coenego> Hi, I'm having a problem with jQuery mobile, it's only in combination with require.js...
[10:13:42] <Coenego> error is: cannot call methods on panel prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'
[10:13:43] <Darsain> it isn't possible. it'd have to be on document
[10:14:02] <Coenego> someone had the same problem, or knows solution? :)
[10:20:01] <skope> why can't i get elements margin with $(selector).css('margin'); ?
[10:20:07] <skope> it just returns empty result
[10:20:25] <amph1bius> are you sure margin is set
[10:21:05] <skope> it is, but apparently according to stackoverflow margin is just shortcut for margin-top, margin-left etc so it doesn't work
[10:21:54] <Ingo2> Hi, i am Linux newbie and iÂ´d like to know if someone knows this book and can tell me if its any good to enter the Linux world: http://t.co/pf3Kk9rnh2 ?
[10:21:56] <skope> so .css('marginTop') works
[10:22:14] <skope> Ingo2: just read from the internet
[10:23:35] <Coenego> any jQm experts?

[10:42:41] <tw2113> css
[10:44:52] <ndboost> any of you on i have a general js question
[10:46:15] <Stromovous__> Does anyone have an idea how to fill DIV with other explicitly named DIVs using jQuery?
[10:46:25] <ndboost> yeah
[10:46:41] <ndboost> use .value() to assign the value of the divs to variables, and then inject into new div
[10:46:50] <ndboost> using append
[10:46:57] <ndboost> thats an easy sloppy way.
[10:49:20] <smftre> Any quick way to get around this? ".map is not a function".
[10:49:26] <alexut> can anyone help me understand this jquery function http://jsfiddle.net/FeUk6/
[10:49:32] <alexut> i'm noob
[10:49:39] <smftre> This is when I do -> json.thelist.map(function (a) { return a.user_id; }); <- and it is empty
[10:49:47] <smftre> how can I check if a json obj is empty?
[10:51:24] <rael> anyone familiar w/ jquery ajax calls in .net ?
[10:51:45] <tw2113> ndboost, i think you're thinking of .html()
[10:51:53] <tw2113> and for inputs/text it's .val()
[10:51:55] <ndboost> tw2113: yeah whatever :)
[10:55:28] <alexut> can anyone help me understand this jquery function http://jsfiddle.net/FeUk6/
[10:55:49] <alexut> how is it called where i can read more about it
[10:57:52] <tw2113> ?attr @ alexut
[10:57:52] <b-ot> alexut: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[10:57:53] <bot-t> alexut, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[10:58:05] <JAAulde> I am attempting to use jcaret for some text editing voodoo, but it seems to expect to be run on something with a value property. has anyone used this or anything else on a div[contenteditable] that could give me some pointers?
[10:59:25] <chinoto> alexut: all it's doing is grabbing everything before the first "#" in the href and appending "#"+thehash to it
[11:15:14] <Che-Anarc> If I do > var obj1 = $("selector li");  < how can I clear its parent? I have the li in another var & want to do eq(0).insertAfter(...);
[11:20:55] <Coenego> anyone having experience with using jq mobile & require.js? (no backbone)
[11:21:07] <MadPig> Wasn't jQuery at 2.0 like a year ago? Now it's stable at jQuery 1.9.1...
[11:22:27] <tw2113> no, it didn't regress in version #
[11:22:37] <MadPig> Odd.
[11:22:46] <MadPig> I think I remember some shit about people not liking jQuery 2.0.
[11:22:50] <MadPig> It had some major change or some shit.
[11:22:54] <NoiseEee> yeah uh nope
[11:22:55] <tw2113> it will have
[11:23:04] <tw2113> 2.0 is ditching IE8 and down
[11:24:54] <tw2113> you probably heard about the 2.0 roadmap MadPig
[11:25:27] <MadPig> I guess.
[11:25:30] <MadPig> Thanks for the update.
[11:32:15] <andrew9184> Am I able to do something while images are loaded, rather after they are loaded.  I'm trying to chomp off the src of an image so it includes another image, but i don't want it to flash the original then show the second one
[11:32:31] <andrew9184> because i know document.ready will fire after the original has loaded, right ?
[11:33:04] <rainabba> Is there any reason that $('tr.altESS').css('display','table-row'); should fail to work as expected in IE8 under any circumstance?
[11:33:29] <rainabba> That is, to find all table rows with class 'altESS' and set their CSS display property to 'table-row'.
[11:33:35] <rainabba> find/select
[11:34:06] <barney> Hey all!
[11:35:06] <barney> Got a question on how jQuery implements Sizzle for legacy IE. Anybody have any insight on this subject?
[11:36:52] <andrew9184> barney: you should check out jQuery source
[11:37:05] <andrew9184> but I feel we've had this chat before because you didn't like the workaround :)
[11:37:40] <barney> Oh?
[11:39:07] <barney> @andrew don't remember that. I'm looking to refire the innit that implements sizset & nodeIndex attributes (etc) so I can get class selectors to work on elements dynamically added without jQuery in IE7.
[11:41:31] <barney> @andrew9184 sorry, what was the chat before?
[11:43:52] <barney> Any clue as to what I should be looking for in the source, specifically?
[11:55:57] <abes> Question: anyone familiar with Foundation4?
[12:02:45] <fission6> is there a common pattern for appending rows to a table with jquery
[12:03:16] <NoiseEee> fission6: uhhh
[12:03:24] <fission6> ?
[12:04:16] <NoiseEee> its really up to you how you want to do it.  $('table').append('<tr><td> //etc </td></tr>') is certainly fine.
[12:04:16] <chinoto> fission6: $('tbody').append('<tr/>')
[12:04:31] <fission6> chinoto: that feels right
[12:04:32] <NoiseEee> mm, tbody
[12:04:36] <fission6> now i got to build the values
[12:04:54] <NoiseEee> fission6: you don't *have* to do it one cell at a time.
[12:05:03] <fission6> ?
[12:05:13] <NoiseEee> the example with the string above.
[12:07:48] <thebishop> does JqueryUI have an input preppend control like Twitter Bootstrap: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms ?  I couldn't find it
[12:14:19] <StephenS> hey guys
[12:15:14] <gf3> Hey StephenS
[12:15:22] <StephenS> hey
[12:16:02] <StephenS> I have ajax form and on click Im calling ajax/signup.php, and if error is occured, new div is showed, hwever I cannot know when sign up is susccessfull
[12:16:16] <StephenS> If signup is successfull, div is created again..
[12:16:21] <StephenS> I want like facebook did.
[12:17:44] <Che-Anarc> I have > order = $("selector li"); & later I want to do $("selector li").remove()  & re-assign - remove works but I cant get this to work: $("selector li").eq(0).insertAfter(order)
[12:17:52] <Che-Anarc> What am I doing wrong?
[12:19:54] <StephenS> Any ideas guys?
[12:20:22] <StephenS> I tried to catch php response via success: function(response) { if(response == "done" } else {$() }}
[12:20:33] <StephenS> but that didnt worked, like response is not done, but in console I see it is.
[12:22:07] <StephenS> gf3, got any idea?
[12:22:10] <StephenS> anyone?
[12:22:39] <gf3> StephenS: Just return that it was successful from your server
[12:22:54] <StephenS> I did
[12:22:55] <gf3> StephenS: Better yet, use actual HTTP status codes to indicate success or otherwise
[12:22:56] <StephenS> hold up
[12:23:00] <StephenS> nono
[12:23:07] <StephenS> ajax is successful always
[12:23:14] <StephenS> but when I.. let me paste
[12:24:18] <StephenS> here gf3 http://jsfiddle.net/tAWcD/
[12:25:54] <StephenS> What Im doing wrong gf3 ?
[12:26:38] <rael> jsfiddle.net/r2c2/fnakb/1/ <-- why cant i add a list item?
[12:27:53] <Kambfhase> rael: syntax error.
[12:28:13] <Kambfhase> rael: click the "JSHint" button at the top-
[12:29:28] <rael> jsfiddle.net/r2c2/fnakb/2 , it's valid now
[12:29:35] <andrew9184> are there front end frameworks for jquery ?
[12:29:41] <gf3> StephenS: http://jsfiddle.net/tAWcD/1/
[12:29:53] <andrew9184> other than tiwtter bootstrap
[12:30:37] <StephenS> ugh?
[12:30:42] <StephenS> gf3, that wont work for me
[12:30:52] <gf3> WORKS FOR ME, GUY
[12:31:02] <StephenS> I send data:data
[12:31:15] <StephenS> actually Im receiving params
[12:31:18] <gf3> You can send whatever you want
[12:31:23] <gf3> The core concept works
[12:31:40] <gf3> Although this is really a job for HTTP statuses
[12:31:43] <StephenS> retrieving value from ajax/s.php does not work as I want
[12:32:10] <StephenS> I have one div class showerror, and I place in it everything i get from click/ajax call on button from ajax/s.php
[12:32:29] <StephenS> so when Im successful, I could just add redirect, but then whole page will show up upon "showerro" div
[12:32:47] <StephenS> and by successful I mean there is no field error, user write in everything as requested
[12:33:22] <rael> ?appendto
[12:33:23] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[12:35:49] <Kambfhase> Q: You all know how $(document).ready() fires event handlers even when they get bound after the document is ready. Is there a way to achieve that behaviour for custom events?
[12:35:50] <StephenS> any ideas why is that?
[12:38:26] <StephenS> hmm I managed to return value
[12:42:59] <fission6> if i have a table, can i hide it and empty then show it like so in some fashion $('table').hide().empty('tbody').show();
[12:44:06] <Andrew_R> fission6: empty doesn't take any parameters
[12:44:17] <fission6> remove
[12:44:22] <fission6> doesn't seem to subselect
[12:44:30] <fission6> $('table').hide().remove('tbody').show();
[12:45:07] <Andrew_R> I don't think you need to .hide() and then .show() immediately after
[12:45:17] <Andrew_R> try: $('table').find('tbody').remove()
[12:45:43] <Andrew_R> or just $('table tbody').remove() if you can
[12:48:49] <ketan_> I think $('tbody').remove() will work.
[12:48:56] <fission6> i should be able to pass remove() a selector
[12:49:05] <fission6> it looks like it doesn't work if it its not a direct child
[12:51:03] <Andrew_R> I think I would just do $('table').empty() which will remove everything inside the table
[12:52:06] <fission6> just went with http://dpaste.org/xO8ZS/
[12:52:09] <fission6> which work swell
[12:52:13] <ketan_> Andres_R: $('table').empty() will remove thead, caption and tfoot etc.
[12:53:18] <Andrew_R> ketan_: yes, it depends on how your table is defined and how much you want to remove
[12:56:20] <raj> does this make `o` a global? http://paste.ofcode.org/PgDyDtLHeB6LN7zBvrCVn5
[12:57:14] <JAAulde> hi all. it seems the jcaret plugin is pretty out of date. anyone have any recommendations on locating and manipulating caret? specific support for contenteditable is a BIG plus. Thanks!
[12:57:25] <mhn23> try.jquery.com is hilarious
[12:58:22] <Kambfhase> raj:  no.
[12:58:32] <raj> Kambfhase, why not?
[12:58:44] <Kambfhase> o is defined on line 3, hence its a local "variable"
[12:58:54] <raj> ohh, interesting
[12:58:55] <raj> thanks
[12:59:09] <Kambfhase> np
[13:03:27] <jschall> hi, i'm having trouble getting the width of a hidden image. $.width() always returns 0.
[13:03:37] <raj> can I make a jquery function that is activated with `$.instantiateMe`?
[13:03:52] <raj> as opposed to off an element
[13:04:06] <raj> $('.something').instantiateMe()
[13:05:06] <Kambfhase> $.instantiateMe = function(){}
[13:05:16] <raj> cool
[13:05:20] <raj> thank you
[13:06:55] <Kambfhase> jschall: it's hidden. hence the browser does not know how wide the image when it will be reinserted in the DOM.
[13:07:53] <mrinehart93> jschall is the image hidden with display:none?
[13:07:58] <jschall> mrinehart93: yes
[13:08:09] <jschall> mrinehart93: well, it's hidden with $.hide()
[13:08:35] <jschall> mrinehart93: so yes
[13:08:36] <mrinehart93> Ok, I'm not up to date with my jQuery knowledge (haven't used it in a month or two), but afaik hide sets display:none;
[13:09:02] <mrinehart93> kind of a hackish method I just came up with
[13:09:03] <mrinehart93> but
[13:09:10] <mrinehart93> instead of hiding it, or after it is hidden
[13:09:30] <mrinehart93> could you just not have it hidden and then set the z-index so that it's "hidden" behind everything?
[13:09:35] <mrinehart93> afaik you could get the width then
[13:09:44] <ktada> jschall you can hide image by setting position:absolute; left:-1000px. then $.width() will return actual width
[13:12:22] <jschall> never mind, i fixed it (in chrome, anyway). i'm just checking the naturalHeight and then height of the image itself rather than using jquery
[13:12:41] <jschall> and width
[13:13:09] <mrinehart93> gotta make it work in FF and IE now :P
[13:18:25] <mrinehart93> does anyone here have experience with working with CKEditor?
[13:20:11] <mhn23> uh what about <script type="">
[13:20:25] <Nece228> hi, sorry for not using jsfiddle but this is logic thing, i think i messed variables: http://paste.opensuse.org/76064633
[13:20:28] <mhn23> is it not common to specify it anymore?
[13:20:45] <Nece228> when i press .up or .down it works fine, but when i press .left it doesnt work
[13:22:01] <PapaSier_> i have some async code that results in a success/failure. the api can take 5 different configurations of params. so i want to try, if success then break, otherwise try with params option 2. if failure, try again with params option 3 ... 5. short of writing 5 nested calls what is good design pattern for this?
[13:22:43] <Andrew_R> Nece228: you will always run into problems loading dynamic image changes like this because the browser will used it's cached copy of the image
[13:23:09] <Andrew_R> commonly what's done is to add a timestamp on the url so the browser never uses it's cached version
[13:23:25] <Nece228> Andrew_R: how to do that?
[13:23:29] <mouses> do you  guys use Evernote? is there a better alternative to taking notes on desktop and mobile? i'm new to evernote
[13:24:49] <Andrew_R> make your img src like 'index.php?up=' + up + '&left=' + left + '&t=' + (new Date()).getTime()
[13:25:25] <velts> is there a way with jquery to get all options not disabled and whos value is not ''
[13:25:52] <velts> or exclude the first option.. and check the rest ..
[13:26:49] <Kambfhase> $('option:not([disabled]):not([value=""])')
[13:26:57] <Kambfhase> (random guess)
[13:27:08] <velts> hmm
[13:27:55] <Kambfhase> ?p @ PapaSier_
[13:27:56] <bot-t> PapaSier_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:28:38] <Kambfhase> mhn23: there is no need to create a type attribute on scripts
[13:28:44] <microhxo> Guys im trying to use a Datetimepicker and for some reason the time always defaults to ZULU time and not standard, so my hour options are 00 to 23 http://jsfiddle.net/bEX5x/  How can i make this standard time?
[13:28:52] <mhn23> Kambfhase: because?
[13:29:11] <mhn23> since i mainly use xthml strict
[13:30:34] <Kambfhase> Well, the MIME Type for JS is application/javascript. But some browsers dont recognize that. Others have problems with text/javascript, plus JS is not text, its code.
[13:30:54] <Kambfhase> if you just leave it out, all browser assume you just want JS
[13:31:32] <Nece228> Andrew_R: thanks, just what i needed :)
[13:31:43] <Andrew_R> np :)
[13:32:40] <Kambfhase> mhn23: you might just want to have a look at the spec though
[13:34:12] <microhxo> Anyone know why my datetimepicker is using zulu by default? How can i make it use standard?  http://jsfiddle.net/bEX5x/
[13:37:02] <Che-Anarc> How can I clear an $("#selector li") and add an object of the same kind back to it?
[13:37:41] <Kambfhase> 'clear a selector' ?
[13:37:59] <Che-Anarc> Well its an unsorted list  <ul>
[13:38:14] <geography> is there a better way to write this? just curious
[13:38:15] <geography> http://jsfiddle.net/QJfQK/1/
[13:39:17] <Kambfhase> geography: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[13:39:18] <microhxo> Here is the answer for anyone who needs it
[13:39:20] <microhxo> http://jsfiddle.net/bEX5x/
[13:39:24] <microhxo> timepicker without zulu
[13:39:49] <geography> but for something as simple as this, you would make a plugin ?
[13:43:43] <StephenS> hey my radio button have default value and not changing when sending ajax call with this code http://jsfiddle.net/ehwSG/ whats wrong with it?

[13:51:00] <Kambfhase> Lundy2: there is neither email, nor password in that code.
[13:53:16] <StephenS> ok I wait
[13:54:15] <Kambfhase> StephenS: effectively your code is doing nothing.
[13:54:46] <Lundy2> Kambfhase, should I encode the password before sending it through to the php page?
[13:55:12] <Kambfhase> o.O just use SSL
[13:55:30] <StephenS> def problem is in that code as I debugged everythng else
[13:56:45] <Lundy2> never used SSL
[13:58:13] <geography> Kambfhase: thank you sir
[13:58:21] <Kambfhase> np
[13:58:22] <geography> just wondering, would you make a plugin for it ?
[13:58:32] <geography> i just wnat to know when i need to/avoid it
[13:58:43] <Kambfhase> For those few lines, that might be overkill
[13:58:52] <StephenS> Kambfhase, its just a preview
[13:58:57] <StephenS> I later on, pass data with ajax
[13:58:59] <StephenS> wanna whole code?

[14:03:16] <StephenS> Kambfhase, can you test my code with your radio buttons form
[14:03:18] <djQuery>  StephenS why not just see .serialize
[14:03:20] <StephenS> youll see something is wrong
[14:03:31] <djQuery> ?serialize@stephens
[14:03:32] <bot-t> stephens, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/

[14:12:54] <masentinel900> Guys!!
[14:13:55] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: if you're still working on the table stuff from monday please shoot me
[14:14:15] <NoiseEee> StephenS: your code should not be using .live() at all.
[14:14:18] <masentinel900> Why
[14:14:28] <StephenS> ok change to .on
[14:14:28] <masentinel900> do you have newIdeas?
[14:14:31] <NoiseEee> masentinel900: beacuse it should not have taken you 5 days to find the problem/solution
[14:15:14] <NoiseEee> StephenS: as that code is written now, the form will ACTUALLY SUBMIT and not be done via xhr
[14:15:31] <StephenS> how to do xhr
[14:16:31] <masentinel900> How will be a changer of background-color with jquery?
[14:17:54] <SirSkitzo> What's the PHP equivalent to explode in jQuery? I figured split but I don't see it i the API
[14:18:08] <SirSkitzo> I'm pretty sure I worded that wrong btw
[14:18:09] <tw2113> .css('background-color','some color value')
[14:18:23] <tw2113> split would be a js native
[14:18:29] <tw2113> not something conjured up by jquery
[14:19:19] <SirSkitzo> Oh, dur. Awesome
[14:20:35] <Kambfhase> $.fn.explode = function(){ $(document).explode(); }; $(document).explode() // BOOOM
[14:21:32] <StephenS> what to do Nois
[14:22:11] <Kambfhase> Oh, wait, the easiest way to explode jQuery is $($)
[14:23:03] <Kambfhase> ?eval $('<div>').is('div')
[14:23:05] <bot-t> Kambfhase: false
[14:23:21] <Kambfhase> lol, n1 bot-t
[14:23:41] <Kambfhase> ?eval $.version
[14:23:41] <bot-t> Kambfhase: undefined
[14:25:01] <Kambfhase> ?eval jQuery.fn.jquery
[14:25:01] <bot-t> Kambfhase: "1.4.2"
[14:25:26] <Kambfhase> ?eval $($)
[14:25:27] <bot-t> Kambfhase: [Document]
[14:28:09] <djQuery> StephenS, what version jquery are you using
[14:28:12] <djQuery> ?on
[14:28:13] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:28:16] <StephenS> 1.6.4
[14:28:21] <StephenS> but that no problem
[14:28:29] <StephenS> serialize wont resolve response
[14:28:37] <djQuery> StephenS, .live was killed in 1.7
[14:29:45] <StephenS> ok
[14:30:04] <StephenS> in each when I loop for all elements inside form is there  a way to not assign radio button value if not checked
[14:30:48] <djQuery> StephenS, $("#showerror").html(response).hide().fadeIn('fast');    use chaning don't select the same element multiple times if you dont have to
[14:31:24] <StephenS> ok
[14:32:20] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/ehwSG/5/      but it looks ok to me
[14:33:23] <StephenS> well it does not work
[14:33:34] <StephenS> on click it calls ajax, however I dont get retrieval message
[14:33:43] <StephenS> I just showerror page..
[14:33:49] <StephenS> div class showed*
[14:34:31] <tds5016> hey guys. I am having some issues with the panel widget and getting a div inside of it position using absolute and seeing bottom to 0.
[14:35:24] <StephenS> what is wrong djQuery
[14:35:49] <StephenS> I mean I have in ajaxsignup.php plain php which get POST etc..
[14:35:56] <StephenS> it should work and give a response
[14:36:24] <nerk> jsfiddle
[14:37:31] <tds5016> nerk: putting together an example now :-)
[14:40:59] <masentinel900> Guys!!, Is well to do a counter from 0 by each one task asigned recently in a tasks module?
[14:41:10] <masentinel900> Is some like notification module of facebook?
[14:41:53] <wroathe> masentinel900: What?
[14:42:15] <StephenS> help yall guys
[14:42:21] <alesan> hey
[14:42:44] <alesan> I am completely new to jquery. but I thought something like $("#username").css('background-color', '#000'); made sense
[14:43:10] <alesan> instead, I do not see any kind of change, the text box stays light gray
[14:43:16] <wroathe> alesan: backgroundColor
[14:43:19] <alesan> is there a problem in the syntax?
[14:43:31] <alesan> oh
[14:43:43] <alesan> it is not the same identifier ad in CSS?
[14:44:04] <wroathe> alesan: Actually both of those should work
[14:44:11] <masentinel900> wroathe: Is like the notification area of facebook
[14:44:24] <wroathe> alesan: Are you sure #username exists in the DOM at the time the script executes?
[14:44:28] <masentinel900> if do you have a new notification show you number 1
[14:44:31] <alesan> wroathe, but apparently it does not...
[14:44:37] <masentinel900> another #2
[14:44:40] <masentinel900> another #3
[14:44:45] <alesan> wroathe, well yes because $("#username").attr("disabled", true); works!
[14:45:06] <masentinel900> When do you see it, discount one
[14:45:12] <masentinel900> understand me?
[14:45:38] <wroathe> alesan: Do you have an "important" declaration in your stylesheet overriding the new inline background color?
[14:45:53] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/ehwSG/6/ ?
[14:45:59] <StephenS> is it the same?
[14:46:25] <alesan> wroathe, oh, you need to help me understand the 'important' part!
[14:46:35] <wroathe> alesan: In your stylesheet
[14:46:44] <wroathe> Do you have something like background-color: red!important;
[14:46:51] <alesan> let me check
[14:47:57] <alesan> wroathe, no, it does not seem so
[14:48:13] <wroathe> StephenS: No
[14:48:22] <wroathe> StephenS: .serialize creates a string representation
[14:48:23] <StephenS> I mean not the same code, but functionallity?
[14:48:50] <StephenS> like ?name=Stephen&lastame=Someone
[14:48:55] <StephenS> like that? I need to send via GET method?
[14:49:03] <wroathe> No
[14:49:11] <StephenS> I just dont get why does I dont ghet response
[14:49:32] <wroathe> StephenS: Show us your AJAX code
[14:49:46] <wroathe> You can just put it in a gist
[14:49:59] <StephenS> I did
[14:50:05] <StephenS> in ajaxsignup.php I have only php code
[14:50:11] <StephenS> but for ajax/jquery its on jsfiddle
[14:50:41] <StephenS> here http://jsfiddle.net/ehwSG/4/
[14:51:30] <Che-Anarc> http://jsfiddle.net/N4X2h/14/ can someone help me? - trying to simple <ul> back to original order not sure if remove() is what i need?
[14:51:58] <alesan> wroathe, ah! there is a background: url assigned to this text! if I find that person that made this...
[14:52:10] <alesan> it's a solid gray png image
[14:52:17] <alesan> what is the meaning of this?
[14:52:28] <wroathe> StephenS: Does it fire the success callback?
[14:52:43] <wroathe> Instead of console.log(response) try console.log("Hello World!") and see if it fires
[14:53:14] <StephenS> yes all good
[14:53:24] <StephenS> well showerror div is fadedin so it works success
[14:53:35] <StephenS> I could add error but it doesnt matter now..
[14:54:21] <wroathe> Btw, success accepts three parameters
[14:54:22] <wroathe> PlainObject data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR
[14:54:55] <wroathe> do a console.log(status) once you get those params in
[14:55:01] <alesan> wroathe, ok it works now... I made background: none and then background-color: #000
[14:55:08] <wroathe> alesan: good
[14:55:27] <StephenS> woot?
[14:55:28] <alesan> how can people be so sick to put a solid png image as background?
[14:55:37] <alesan> instead of simply specifying a color?
[14:56:07] <wroathe> StephenS: What's the status code?
[14:56:14] <wroathe> StephenS: In the success callback?
[14:56:15] <StephenS> sec
[14:56:32] <veQue> djQuery: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4684013/is-it-possible-to-re-populate-a-file-select-form-field-with-what-the-user-previo
[14:56:45] <veQue> guess it's safe
[14:56:53] <StephenS> success
[14:56:56] <StephenS> is the status code.
[14:57:39] <tds5016> figured it out.... turns out I needed to set the div.ui-panel-inner for the div to get it to take up 100%.
[14:58:09] <StephenS> wroathe, ?
[14:58:32] <wroathe> StephenS: That means your JS is fine
[14:58:38] <wroathe> StephenS: You need to fix your PHP
[14:59:05] <StephenS> php is good
[14:59:20] <StephenS> maybe form is fucked up?
[14:59:37] <StephenS> <form action="/ajax/ajaxsignup.php" method="POST" id="signupbox" class="signupclass">elements...</form>
[14:59:46] <Che-Anarc> I need to fix me js  :-p  with the unorderd list - its should be simple but I cant put it together  :-(
[14:59:46] <wroathe> StephenS: Nope
[15:00:03] <wroathe> StephenS: Are you echoing anything in the PHP script
[15:00:10] <StephenS> Yes, thats how I get response
[15:00:26] <wroathe> And what's in the response?
[15:00:28] <StephenS> maybe I need to return json type?
[15:00:36] <StephenS> nothing, there is no ersponse
[15:00:39] <wroathe> Post the PHP code
[15:00:41] <StephenS> thats the problem when using serialize
[15:00:49] <StephenS> Its very big, i can do part of it
[15:00:59] <wroathe> Just post the whole file
[15:01:06] <wroathe> In a gist or something
[15:02:04] <StephenS> http://pastebin.com/UCVjpa38
[15:02:14] <StephenS> so that "this is ok username" should be returned as response, but it isnt
[15:03:24] <wroathe> StephenS: What's the name of the username input field?
[15:03:45] <StephenS> name="username"
[15:03:57] <wroathe> needs to be name="signup"
[15:03:57] <StephenS> and in php $username = $_POST['username'];
[15:03:59] <wroathe> for that php code to work
[15:04:07] <wroathe> Oh
[15:04:12] <djQuery> StephenS, add an error handler to you ajax request
[15:04:28] <StephenS> console already says its successful
[15:04:36] <StephenS> wroathe, why that?
[15:04:42] <wroathe> Nvm
[15:04:45] <djQuery> StephenS, or use the network tab to inspect the response more closesly
[15:04:48] <wroathe> You didn't post enough code
[15:05:10] <StephenS> but the thing is with my old code it works good
[15:05:10] <wroathe> I assumed that signup was where you were getting $username from
[15:05:14] <StephenS> so php is not problem
[15:05:46] <wroathe> StephenS: If you want help post the entire picture, HTML, JS, and PHP
[15:06:15] <wroathe> I feel like I'm interrogating you for information about YOUR problem
[15:07:47] <Husar> Hi, someone visit site A a submit form, can I create script what submit another form, on website B without any notification? (in background)
[15:07:56] <StephenS> I just think php is not a problem
[15:08:08] <StephenS> i can try on smaller php code
[15:09:53] <Che-Anarc> Help required with restoring simple unorered list back: http://jsfiddle.net/N4X2h/14/
[15:11:14] <tab1293> can i configure autocomplete so that it doesnt populate a drop down with items but instead an unordered list?
[15:12:06] <StephenS> hmm I did debugging, it seems like post method was never send with ajax
[15:12:08] <StephenS> what it could be?
[15:12:11] <djQuery> Che-Anarc, do you do anything to store what the order was in the first place?
[15:12:37] <djQuery> Che-Anarc, do you have an attribute that you can just sort them by?
[15:12:55] <Che-Anarc> djQuery   Yes at the start with if (order == 0)
[15:13:53] <Theowning> I'm thinking
[15:13:57] <Theowning> and tell me if I'm wrong
[15:14:06] <StephenS> progress made
[15:14:18] <tab1293> i have this code which populates a list but it also shows an empty dropdown which i dont want
[15:14:19] <tab1293> http://pastebin.com/pv0p22LH
[15:14:44] <StephenS> however dont know why does not type submit with name="signup" as if($_POST['submit']), what ya think wroathe djQuery ?
[15:14:46] <Theowning> one of the easiest ways to do that would just be to set  'order = $( "#unordered_list li" ).clone()'
[15:15:05] <Theowning> and then just replace the entire thing in one fell swoop
[15:15:48] <Che-Anarc> Theowning   from the log I do on "order" it seems that I have a clone... no?
[15:15:54] <wroathe> StephenS: I'm not helping until you post more code.
[15:16:13] <StephenS> more php code wont help you
[15:16:15] <Theowning> i didn't actually look at the log yet
[15:16:20] <Theowning> hold on
[15:16:24] <wroathe> StephenS: Seeing the form will
[15:16:32] <StephenS> because I found what was beign buggy in php
[15:16:38] <StephenS> which was not really a bug, its ajax failure
[15:16:42] <SirSkitzo> Just made a cool matrix script on accident: http://jsfiddle.net/qntJn/2/ .. whoops
[15:16:44] <wroathe> StephenS: :/
[15:19:30] <Che-Anarc> I am not sure if I should be doing mixed_order.parent.remove(); http://jsfiddle.net/N4X2h/16/
[15:20:44] <StephenS> fixed it finall
[15:21:05] <StephenS> y, dont know what was the problem with singup button submission, so I changed trigger for $_POST with username.
[15:21:51] <Theowning> Che-Anarc, http://jsfiddle.net/4SxWf/
[15:22:02] <Theowning> Lines 26 and 27
[15:22:33] * Che-Anarc looking
[15:24:42] <Che-Anarc> Theowning   wow   that simple?  -   amazing thanks man!  I dont know why one of my co-workers was doing parent().remove...  u a life saver!
[15:24:52] <Theowning> np
[15:28:11] <Che-Anarc> Anybody in here making extensive use of jqm? could really do with like 12 hours of talent from some1 to finish my project off on Sunday  :-p  otherwise I will be behind yet another week.
[15:31:08] <StephenS> hmm when I have ajax in remote /js/jsajax.js and include it on page
[15:31:13] <StephenS> it does not run/recognize it, how come?
[15:33:08] <tab1293> anyone know how to hide the dropdown menu in autocomplete and only output data to a selected element?
[15:45:06] <SirSkitzo> Anyone mind helping me with this code? After I enter a keyword and press enter the first time, the textbox keeps updating everytime I type. Instead, it should only update when I press enter, which should consequently add a \n, in the textarea?
[15:45:34] <SirSkitzo> Oh, wow. Nvm. I think I got it
[15:50:58] <brian___> i was wondering if there was any jQuery plugin that provides a dropdown list similar to the <select> tag but can have any arbitrary html in the options like images, bolded text, etc. my google-fu is failing me

[15:58:48] <monk3y> ?
[16:01:37] <rainabba> I want to select all elements having a particular attribute. I know I can use $('*[attrname]') to select all the attributes, but how do I select their parent elements?
[16:02:14] <rainabba> Since I'm actually selecting the attribute value, there is no parent().
[16:06:49] <shoky> you don't select values
[16:07:12] <shoky> $('[attrname]')  selects elements that have that attribute. .parent() will work fine
[16:07:29] <shoky> er i meant you don't select attributes
[16:07:40] <shoky> rainabba ^
[16:10:23] <rainabba> So $('[ri]').parent().each(function(foo) { console.log(foo); } ) should log each element having a child with an attribute named "ri" right?
[16:10:45] <gf3> `tias @ rainabba
[16:10:45] <b-ot> rainabba: Try It And See
[16:10:53] <rainabba> no shit?
[16:11:02] <rainabba> Think I'd be here asking if I hadn't?
[16:11:07] <gf3> Yes
[16:11:10] <shoky> .each(function(i, foo) {
[16:11:22] <rainabba> gf3: You must deal with some idiots then and I'm not one of them.
[16:11:29] <gf3> rainabba: OH GOOD
[16:11:31] <rainabba> shoky: ty
[16:11:55] <olivier_bK> hi
[16:27:48] <rainabba> shoky: Thanks for the help. So $.each($('#context [ri]').parent(), function(bu) { console.log(bu); }); returns "0" in the console (Chrome) but then the div I'd expect from the selector used in the each() so it seems that I'm selecting the elments I intend and .each() is firing but my object reference is no good because I'd expect to see the div listed in the console where I'm seeing the "0".
[16:27:48] <rainabba> Where am I going wrong? Here's a pastebin: http://pastebin.com/fKfGWDvt
[16:28:26] <rainabba> coldhead: Can you teach gf3 some manners (assuming it's possible)?
[16:28:41] <rainabba> coldhead: Wake up......
[16:28:47] <rainabba> Useless bot
[16:28:58] <gf3> Worst bot
[16:29:23] <rainabba> What can ya do?
[16:29:29] <rainabba> He's old
[16:30:21] <rainabba> Ohh. Just had a thought and I'm going back to the docs for .each().
[16:31:14] <rainabba> :) Always helps to read references carefully and not make bad assumptions.
[16:31:29] <rainabba> $.each($('#context [ri]').parent(), function(i, bu) { console.log(bu); });
[16:32:09] <rainabba> Shoky: Should have caught that when you used "i" instead of my object name.  Thanks for the help sir.
[16:34:57] <gf3> rainabba: http://jsfiddle.net/gxnTX/
[16:35:08] <gf3> rainabba: That's how I'd do it, assuming you only wanted unique parents
[16:42:26] <rainabba> Ty. I need to digest that because I've only used map with some ajax calls in copy/paste code so I'm not sure the difference between it and each().
[16:43:23] <shoky> wouldn't .parent() do the same thing here?
[16:45:40] <gf3> shoky: Yeah but then you have to wrap `el`
[16:47:17] <shoky> you mean the result would be a jquery obj instead of a plain array?
[16:48:00] <shoky> doesn't sound like a big deal.. maybe i'm missing something
[16:49:53] <rainabba> I've complicated the question for the sake of learning (not to be difficult for the sake of it) so don't be surprised if something seems off.
[16:50:35] <shoky> shrugs
[16:50:35] <b-ot> shoky: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[16:50:54] <shoky> wait is there still a question?
[16:51:30] <oojacoboo> why is it that when I am setting val() on inputs within a loop, they aren't being applied?
[16:51:46] <rainabba> I think I'm going to end up with something like (run via .click() on an element): $.each($(this).closest('[someattr]').find('[anotherattr]'), function()) to build a json object
[16:51:48] <shoky> oojacoboo: fiddle plz
[16:52:01] <geymed> #jquery-dev
[16:52:08] <shoky> rainabba: why $.each?  just use $(...).each()
[16:52:10] <oojacoboo> shoky: are you saying there isn't a specific reason this should be happening?
[16:52:16] <oojacoboo> I thought it might be an obvious one
[16:52:28] <shoky> oojacoboo:  there could be thousands
[16:52:40] <rainabba> shoky: $(this).closest('[someattr]').find('[anotherattr]').each()   ?
[16:52:43] <shoky> my first hunch is you have a for loop with an index
[16:52:50] <shoky> and nested callbacks
[16:52:53] <oojacoboo> shoky: each()
[16:52:57] <shoky> darn.
[16:52:59] <oojacoboo> no callbacks
[16:53:01] <shoky> see, nothing is obvious
[16:53:03] <shoky> fiddle plz :P
[16:53:26] <SirSkitzo> Anyone mind helping me with this code? After I enter a keyword and press enter the first time, the textbox keeps updating everytime I type. Instead, it should only update when I press enter, which should consequently add a \n, in the textarea? http://jsfiddle.net/qntJn/4/
[16:53:56] * rainabba just realized that fiddle here was being refered to as the site and not the library jsFiddle
[16:53:59] <shoky> rainabba:  yea p
[16:54:12] <rainabba> Sorry to code spam :)
[16:54:57] <shoky> there's a jsfiddle lib?
[16:58:30] <shoky> SirSkitzo did you mean http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/qntJn/5/ ?
[16:59:09] <shoky> SirSkitzo:  doing this.value.replace('\n', ',');   doesn't do anything unless you use the return value
[17:01:47] <oojacoboo> shoky: I can't replicate it, but it's trying to use a variable with an int within the each loop using $(this).val(variable)
[17:01:53] <oojacoboo> any thoughts
[17:02:03] <shoky> nope
[17:02:09] <oojacoboo> yea :/
[17:02:21] <shoky> "using a variable with an int" ?
[17:05:44] <oojacoboo> shoky: variable that's an int
[17:06:36] <shoky> yea i got it eventually ;p
[17:06:49] <shoky> not too sober;p
[17:07:19] <vacho> why can't I store a string in an int?

[17:10:06] <titii> is here?
[17:34:38] <SirSkitzo> shoky: Could you explain what you meant by, "doing this.value.replace('\n', ',');   doesn't do anything unless you use the return value". And I updated it to http://jsfiddle.net/qntJn/6/

[17:50:46] <murenovich> sorry im a newbie
[17:50:55] <tw2113> we noticed quick
[17:50:55] <tw2113> :D
[17:51:00] <RandalSchwartz> "im" = "instant message".  did you mean "I'm"?
[17:51:14] <murenovich> yes i'm
[17:51:16] <RandalSchwartz> and if so, why did you leave out the "'"?
[17:51:28] <RandalSchwartz> are you paying for IRC by the character?  If so, sux 2 b u.
[17:51:33] <Gazpacho> you also need to escape the " inside the javscript string
[17:51:51] <shoky> SirSkitzo: i meant doing .replace() doesn't actually replace anything in the original string.. it just returns a new string
[17:51:53] <Gazpacho> oh wait I'm wrong

[18:08:04] <hugo_moss> hi, im using the lazy load script in magento, and for some reason the css fadein animation flickers, anyone know how to resolve that?
[18:09:24] <thinkerweb> I am using a jquery validator plugin, and when the validation happens the input's and textarea's border color turns red, how do I edit it?
[18:10:15] <thinkerweb> input:active, input:focus, didn't work
[18:11:18] <hugo_moss> what plugin is this
[18:11:19] <murenovich> just a quick thought, if I broke my message up into separate strings and separated them with + '\n' + in between each string could that solve my problem?
[18:12:17] <thinkerweb> https://github.com/victorjonsson/jQuery-Form-Validator
[18:12:46] <thinkerweb> I can change the color of the error  but not the border color
[18:13:42] <hugo_moss> how did you change the color of the error
[18:13:44] <hugo_moss> manually?
[18:13:45] <hugo_moss> in css
[18:14:12] <hugo_moss> because the styles.css looks like where all the styles are, and you can test by turning on/off certain styles in google chrome
[18:14:16] <thinkerweb> hugo_moss, yes
[18:14:29] <hugo_moss> use google chrome inspector
[18:14:34] <hugo_moss> and see which style is being applied
[18:14:43] <hugo_moss> inspect the border area, and then look for the css
[18:18:20] <thinkerweb> I cant find it
[18:18:53] <hugo_moss> on lines 61-63 there looks like a border being added
[18:18:56] <hugo_moss> in styles.css
[18:19:41] <thinkerweb> yeah buy #ccc is gray, I am looking for a red input border
[18:20:04] <thinkerweb> Are there some other states besides input:active, input:hover...?
[18:21:42] <hugo_moss> can you get the exact color from the css
[18:23:49] <tw2113> got a link to your actual test instance?
[18:24:24] <RandalSchwartz> jsfillde!
[18:24:28] <RandalSchwartz> oops.  jsfiddle

[19:05:01] <Wolfed> The best way to pull off a resizable "table" would be to not use <table></table>, right?
[19:09:52] <veQue> anyone have a suggestion for styling disabled inputs in ie?
[19:09:59] <veQue> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602070/changing-font-colour-in-textboxes-in-ie-which-are-disabled
[19:10:18] <veQue> basically i can fix the prob in ff
[19:10:45] <veQue> but it's unstylable in ie, just shows as grey
[19:12:01] <veQue> i tried Schnapz suggestion
[19:12:12] <veQue> and no luck
[19:13:56] <veQue> hmm
[19:14:11] <tw2113> add a custom class and just style that when you need to
[19:14:46] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/TQUhD/1/
[19:15:13] <veQue> tw2113: doesn't seem to work in ie
[19:16:33] <tw2113> adding a class?
[19:16:51] <tw2113> granted you'd need to find a way to check that it's an error for that part
[19:16:58] <veQue> i have a class
[19:17:10] <veQue> it wont change color
[19:18:37] <tw2113> you're going to have to find a way to check for disabled status that works in IE
[19:19:14] <tw2113> i dunno
[19:30:22] <firedfox> veQue: maybe you can try to simulate the input with a div
[19:32:45] <veQue> yeh i'd have to style it
[19:33:07] <veQue> trying a <output> tag
[19:43:03] <veQue> no good
[19:43:33] <veQue> still would have to style it
[19:46:13] <veQue> hmm everytime
[19:46:35] <veQue> always linking me to w3fools
[20:33:31] <Wolfed> So I have this .resize() which works fine on a jsfiddle but doesnt work on my site. Any suggestions why? The resizable div is part of an ajax fetched content.
[20:33:51] <Wolfed> I get the arrow on the corner to resize but it doesnt move anywhere
[20:34:30] <Wolfed> At firs the .resize() didnt style the div, so I moved it into the ajax load complete function
[20:37:08] <raj> can I add an event listener to an element before I add it to the DOM?
[20:37:30] <gavilan2> raj: I'd think so... but only if you have it in a doc fragment
[20:42:38] <sahbeewah> doesn't have to be a document fragment...
[20:43:58] <Wolfed> am I getting the silence treatment? lol
[20:47:34] <sahbeewah> Wolfed, your question is unclear
[20:47:45] <sahbeewah> also, afaik resize only works on the window element
[20:47:57] <sahbeewah> you should paste some code if you need help
[20:49:12] <Wolfed> Yeah I know, its just this is like the 4th question I asked in the past few days with people active or being active around my question and getting totally ignored, so yeah, the silent treatment question kinda popped into my head :P
[20:49:27] <Wolfed> Not that I am complaining or anything :P
[20:49:51] <Wolfed> Totally felt like 3rg grade :P
[20:49:57] <Wolfed> 3rd*
[20:50:42] <Wolfed> Anyways, http://jsfiddle.net/4Wfqr/ thats what I have which works on the fiddle just not on my site (Only difference is that the html comes from an ajax request)
[20:55:25] <sahbeewah> does the element you're calling resizable on exist in the dom when you call it?
[20:55:48] <Wolfed> Yes
[20:56:17] <Wolfed> It gets the resizable class "ui-resizable"
[20:58:19] <Wolfed> I am not sure if this is related to the content being ajax fetched or not, since it doesnt give the ui-resizable class unless I put $("selector").resizable() on the ajax complete call
[20:59:36] <sahbeewah> you should be able to resize the element before the ajax call
[20:59:43] <stranded> hi, is there a way to call a function whenever an element is created dynamically?
[21:00:24] <Wolfed> Figured so too, since creating the resizable doesnt actually rely on dom events afaik
[21:00:30] <Wolfed> But it refused to :P
[21:01:44] <sahbeewah> Wolfed, what i mean is, you should be able to resize given that the container is there and that your ajax call retrieves the li elements, which i assume, because you don't make that clear
[21:02:01] <sahbeewah> so adding the elements via ajax is irrelevant to that resizing to work
[21:02:21] <sahbeewah> if you're retrieving all of the html in the ajax, then yes everything needs to be in the ajax complete/done callback
[21:02:39] <Wolfed> What I posted in the fiddle is the actual ajax reply, copied straight from there
[21:03:18] <Wolfed> except the css/$().resize which are loaded in my base files, but the html is from the ajax reply
[21:04:29] <sahbeewah> the actual calling of .resizable on the element needs to occur inside the ajax complete/done callback
[21:04:51] <sahbeewah> stranded, call the function after your create the element?
[21:05:13] <Wolfed> Yes after
[21:05:20] <Wolfed> Wait, what?
[21:05:25] <Wolfed> *Got lost* Sorry
[21:05:46] <Wolfed> Yes, .resizable is called after the data has been placed in the dom.
[21:07:24] <stranded> let me try that
[21:08:17] <sahbeewah> Wolfed, you're going to need to give us a link to the actual code / or something more representative of it, that's causing the problem i'm afraid
[21:09:30] <Wolfed> http://jsfiddle.net/4Wfqr/1/ Thats how my ajax call looks like
[21:09:49] <Wolfed> Alright, I?ll try to build something real quick
[21:10:45] <stranded> it worked, thanks!
[21:15:54] <stranded> wait, it didn't, how would i pass that element to the function?
[21:17:48] <stranded> the element is being created by ajax response from a php file
[21:19:30] <shoky> same way you pass anything else to a function
[21:23:49] <stranded> its a div with a classname 'time', so if i pass by classname, wouldn't it pass all divs with the same classname?
[21:24:41] <shoky> if you pass the classname, that's what youll have inside
[21:24:47] <shoky> if you pass the element, you'll get the element
[21:26:00] <shoky> (if you pass a jquery obj, you'll get a jquery obj)
[21:26:04] <shoky> (the same one)
[21:26:16] <shoky> $('.classname')  <-- a jquery obj
[21:27:07] <stranded> if i have a lot of objects of the same classname then?
[21:27:17] <Gazpacho> the querymasons: to get one, pass one
[21:27:21] <shoky> then?
[21:27:31] <shoky> you said you created an element
[21:27:44] <shoky> what does that have to do with this
[21:28:42] <shoky> var newDiv = $('<div>');  myFunc( newDiv );    that passes a jquery object
[21:28:54] <Wolfed> Ok
[21:29:00] <Wolfed> I think I pulled it off
[21:29:33] <Wolfed> Code might be messy since its just a copy from what I could to make the issue be triggered
[21:30:08] <Wolfed> http://jsfiddle.net/4Wfqr/2/ If you click on any of the 4 links in List, the ajax will occur the .resizable() won't be resizable :P
[21:31:39] <stranded> ok, the element is being created in html, how would i pass that, and if i create it like this, how would i add it in my html? "parentname".append()?
[21:33:29] <shoky> Wolfed it's just cause of the containment
[21:34:08] <stranded> and if that div contains more divs, then i have to append the sub divs first then append it in html?
[21:34:46] <Wolfed> wtf when I first tried it was without the containment and it didnt work ither
[21:34:47] <Wolfed> -_-
[21:34:50] <Wolfed> *Tries again*
[21:35:01] <shoky> Wolfed: you're doin containment on a non-existent container
[21:35:26] <Wolfed> Well, it was copied code, I could've missed some pieces
[21:35:34] <Wolfed> But without the containment it didnt work either, lemme try it out
[21:36:22] <Wolfed> Well without containment it does not work on my side either but does on the fiddle.. wtf
[21:36:30] <shoky> ;]
[21:36:50] <Wolfed> This is getting kinda annoying -_-
[21:37:17] <shoky> maybe you have repeated ids?
[21:37:28] <shoky> when inserting the new ajax content, maybe
[21:37:33] <Wolfed> Nope
[21:37:39] <Wolfed> *Checks just in case*
[21:38:00] <Wolfed> Nope, just one "res
[21:38:02] <Wolfed> #res*
[21:39:09] <Wolfed> What bothers me though is that the css/class are being applied to #res
[21:39:17] <Wolfed> Its just the actual resizing that does not work
[21:39:42] <stranded> my php returns me html as "<div class='time'> text here </div>" i just want to hide this div when its created
[21:39:45] <Wolfed> I have the arrows in the left right corner, my mouse does change like it'd resize
[21:41:43] <Wolfed> Well whatever I guess I won't rely on resizable
[21:41:46] <Wolfed> Thanks anyway
[21:47:00] <sahbeewah> Wolfed, your problem is in the containment
[21:47:58] <sahbeewah> not sure if it needs to be a parent element, but it makes sense that it probably should be, which yours isn't
[21:48:20] <sahbeewah> but more importantly, it doesn't have a height, which gives it the erratic results you're seeing
[22:03:48] <defaultro> Hey guys, what are your thoughts about this. My officemate told me he didn't like the way I wrote the code. In my javascript file, I used ajax to call a REST service which returns a hashcode. He didn't like it because it's client side.
[22:04:12] <defaultro> He told me to put it in a service side.
[22:07:53] <tw2113> server*
[22:07:57] <tw2113> make him justify why
[22:08:12] <defaultro> i'm trying to recall what his response was
[22:08:36] <Foxhoundz> defaultro: Is your web app a one-page javascript app?
[22:08:42] <defaultro> no
[22:08:53] <Foxhoundz> Are you trying to implement some sort of an API?
[22:08:54] <defaultro> we're using Kohana 2.x framework
[22:08:58] <Foxhoundz> oh
[22:09:11] <Foxhoundz> Never used it
[22:09:28] <defaultro> I'm going to write a simple helper/function that will connect to the REST service and output the hashcode
[22:09:37] <defaultro> that will be written in php
[22:09:57] <defaultro> Now, I can't figure out how the javascript will pull the value without using ajax
[22:10:40] <defaultro> I was thinking of using memcached. HOwever, I will need to download jsmemcached

[22:33:54] <thinkerweb> you know when a jquery validator plugin's usually highlight the input borders for offending inputs, how do set the color.  It isn't input:active or input:focus
[22:41:26] <Braden`> Hello
[22:42:00] <monk3y> Greetings.
[22:42:24] <Braden`> jquery-1.9.1.js (line 541):  SyntaxError:  JSON.parse: unexpected character --> return window.JSON.parse( data );
[22:43:12] <monk3y> Heheh .. I'm  .. uh .. guessing you need help with that?
[22:43:16] <systemfault> Braden`: Seems that your JSON isn't valid?
[22:43:31] <monk3y> Yeah, something in 'data' that's bad?
[22:43:42] <monk3y> Did you console.log data at all?
[22:44:15] <systemfault> monk3y: That won'y help him
[22:44:19] <systemfault> *won't
[22:44:35] <systemfault> He needs to look in the network tab of his dev tool suite.
[22:45:30] <monk3y> Oh right, you think the parsed version has something bad in it.. therefore whatever's expecting JSON is choking on it.
[22:45:48] <Braden`> Oh, I see
[22:45:54] <Braden`> The AJAX response had a PHP error in it
[22:45:56] <Braden`> Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_DOUBLE_ARROW
[22:46:02] <Braden`> Thank you
[22:46:05] <systemfault> Braden`: You got your answer :D
[22:46:11] <monk3y> Ah yeah, that old chestnut.
[22:46:53] <monk3y> My first foray into AJAX/JSON had me sending PHP/HTML-decorated error messages for aaaages - as JSON - before I cleaned it all up.
[23:05:50] <Braden`> My form and fields are not being passed as part of my AJAX call for some reason.  http://pastebin.com/xfm4q6d5
[23:06:37] <RandalSchwartz> are you sure serialized data is correct?
[23:07:17] <Braden`> As far as I can tell...
[23:07:19] <RandalSchwartz> and I'm sure $inputs is for debugging
[23:07:30] <RandalSchwartz> so what's in serialzedData?
[23:07:40] <RandalSchwartz> have you logged that?
[23:08:10] <Braden`> let me check
[23:08:56] <Braden`> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data
[23:09:14] <RandalSchwartz> that's not good
[23:09:18] <Braden`> Though, thats unrelated I think
