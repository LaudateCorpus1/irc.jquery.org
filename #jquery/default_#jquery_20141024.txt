[00:40:33] <amh345> i've got some query runnig that moves a div into another div when the page loads.   problem I'm having is when the user hits the page-- you see the div in it's original spot and then it moves creating a flicker effect.  is there a way around this?
[00:43:49] * Kartagis squeezes squeakytoy to see if he really does that
[00:43:58] * squeakytoy burps
[00:44:20] <Kartagis> I didn't know toys burped
[00:47:35] <squeakytoy> yea? Well f#*k Y#*!
[00:47:42] <squeakytoy> Its like teddie from that movie
[00:47:54] <squeakytoy> very vulgar toy
[00:51:35] <amh345> any ideas on how to deal with divs showing in one spot and then jumping to another when query executes?
[00:51:56] <Dirkjan> I am making a filter system, containing jquery ui range sliders and checkboxes, to filter a paginated database result obtained from an ajax request. Because people can set various filters directly after another, I want to wait one second after the last filter change before doing the ajax request (to save on requests). Anyone can point me to the right strategy to use?
[01:03:29] <hactor> Why doesn't the $.post shorthand have "failure" handler, only success?
[01:03:35] <hactor> Or am I reading this wrong?
[01:04:30] <suspicious_eel> hactor: you can use .fail()
[01:04:45] <hactor> suspicious_eek, yah but an odd omission amirite
[01:04:51] <suspicious_eel> see example at "The jqXHR Object" part at http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[01:04:54] <hactor> suspicious_eek, does fail() pass the response?
[01:05:58] <suspicious_eel> I'd think you can find it at jqxhr itself (this), but I'm not sure
[01:06:46] <suspicious_eel> hactor: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[01:08:18] <hactor> suspicious_eek, thanks!
[01:11:12] <hactor> It doesn't pass data.
[01:11:15] <hactor> Why, god why
[01:11:33] <hactor> "Haz errors? Screw you, no data."
[01:12:34] <Paradisee> o/
[01:13:33] <hactor> What is the internal function jQuery uses to transform response text (JSON, XML, etc) to something more immediately usable?
[01:18:59] <xec> hactor: that depends on the response type, but you can probably find it at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src/ajax
[01:21:31] <hactor> xec, I found parseJSON and parseXML but I want to find the automatic one jQuery uses itself
[01:21:33] <hactor> And I can't
[01:21:49] <hactor> oddly there's no "parse" in xhr.js :P
[01:23:04] <hactor> Where is $.post defined/
[01:24:21] <hactor> jQuery.each(["get", "post"], function (i, method) { jQuery[method] = ... })
[01:24:22] <hactor> Honestly?
[01:24:30] <hactor> That code is too smart for its own good.
[01:33:13] <hactor> folks
[01:33:25] <hactor> How do I get my parsed data when there's an error code.
[01:33:32] <hactor> Why does this have to be such a nightmare
[01:35:51] <Dirkjan> When having various events from different (related) elements, is there a technique to wait one second (of no events occuring) after the last event to start a function?
[01:36:26] <xec> usually it's one or the other, you get data *or* an error code
[01:36:56] <hactor> xec, I know what jQuery does but that's not what *HTTP* does.
[01:37:18] <hactor> xec, I pass back data about the error.
[01:37:34] <hactor> and now I' find myself in some maze of badly written code here
[01:37:44] <hactor> I can't tease out the conversion code without rewriting it
[01:37:46] <xec> hactor: try logging the jqXHR object, see what its response contains
[01:37:56] <hactor> xec contains .responseText
[01:38:18] <xec> which is what
[01:38:42] <xec> json?
[01:39:48] <hactor> xec, it's text. As in, the content-type is JSON but it doesn't parse it
[01:41:09] <xec> hactor: then you could just $.parseJSON() it ?
[01:45:10] <gabbeh> hey, I'm trying to learn jquery, find it hard to find easy documents and tutorials that are more than totally basic. can somebody point me in the right direction here? http://jsfiddle.net/BKg6z/2/
[01:45:22] <hactor> xec, man... I need the *automatic* parser
[01:45:35] <hactor> xec, I'm writing a library it should behave the same as it does in done()
[01:46:02] <hactor> Who the f honestly decided "hey, errors have no body!"
[01:46:11] <hactor> Because it certainly is not IETF nor W3C
[01:52:25] <koneko> gabbeh: remove one ending bracket, you have too many
[01:52:46] <gabbeh> sorry i think i pasted the wrong fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/hGabbeh/pwfg9bf9/
[01:52:51] <xec> gabbeh: are you trying to only hide the achievement containing the button you clicked, or all of them?
[01:53:10] <gabbeh> im trying to get the achievement parent so i can just "bookmark" 1 and not all
[01:53:22] <gabbeh> just the one with the button
[01:53:29] <xec> ?closest @ gabbeh
[01:53:45] <xec> i guess the bot is dead
[01:53:50] <xec> try reading http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:54:03] <gabbeh> on it
[01:54:03] <xec> it's probably what you want for finding a parent element
[01:55:43] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/pwfg9bf9/1/
[01:58:29] <gabbeh> thank you!
[01:58:58] <gabbeh> i couldn't manage to make my 'this' work earlier, maybe i forgot something. much appreciated!
[02:07:10] <Pitel_IPEX> How can I react on simple click event, but not on click and drag, when you select some text?

[03:07:00] <jnoob> I am using google maps api function which gives me 2 variables lat and long

[03:07:26] <jnoob> http://jsfiddle.net/baoqkcvy/
[03:10:59] <Erwat> have the other functions check whether they're present?
[03:11:20] <Erwat> or alternatively have some boolean that is set to true when both long and lat are present?
[03:24:04] <jnoob> Erwat: I tried but didn't succeed in that
[03:25:10] <jnoob> Can someone explain what does -1 represent in this function : http://jsbin.com/boruzilabo/edit
[03:27:19] <jnoob> I have never seen such expression before
[03:27:19] <xec> jsnoob: it is what it looks like, it's a negative one
[03:27:31] <xec> jnoob: indexOf() returns -1 if it doesnt find anything
[03:28:42] <jnoob> xec: oh ok..thanks
[03:28:50] <xec>  jnoob: -1 != t.indexOf("S") would return true if "S" is found in t
[03:57:22] <Mark_____> hello.
[03:57:24] <Mark_____> noob question
[03:57:45] <Mark_____> <a href="#" onclick="jQuery('#loginWindow').css('display','block');" >
[03:57:54] <Mark_____> in this code, why does it use jquery inside onclick?
[03:58:16] <Mark_____> can’t it just load #loginwindow by itself?
[03:59:31] <jnoob> Mark_____:  On click, jquery adds the css to #loginWindow
[04:00:29] <Mark_____> is this the same case?
[04:00:30] <Mark_____> jQuery('button').on('click', function () {
[04:00:31] <Mark_____>   jQuery('.toggle').toggleClass('out');
[04:00:31] <Mark_____> });
[04:00:47] <Mark_____> im so confused.
[04:01:06] <Mark_____> guess i will have to learn the jquery basics.
[04:02:36] <jnoob> In this case, on click a function is executed
[04:02:50] <jnoob> jQuery('.toggle').toggleClass('out');
[04:03:49] <jnoob> Mark_____:  there are some pretty good resourced to learn jquery
[04:03:59] <Mark_____> i know.
[04:04:01] <jnoob> Check http://try.jquery.com/ and http://learn.jquery.com/
[04:05:21] <Mark_____> if i just want to load a login layer from nowhere, i can just set the display to visible on toggle.out right?
[04:41:13] <doug64k> Mark_____: don't put event handlers in the html, use .on
[04:42:21] <doug64k> event handler attributes are ancient history, utterly obsolete now
[04:43:39] <doug64k> when you are debugging, do you want to have to comb through the html to find your source code? I didnt think so
[04:44:18] <doug64k> the last thing you want is little bits of code scattered through a sea of html gibberish
[04:59:23] <koleS> How can I clone a <tr> and append the clone to a table?
[05:00:13] <koleS> I was trying to do it like this: var $clone = $(‘.my-tr-class’).clone(); and append the clone
[05:00:29] <koleS> but this clones all <tr> elements in the table and I want only one row
[05:01:46] <koleS> and if I tried to var $clone = $(‘.my-tr-class’)[0].clone() it raised an exception, that the single row does not have clone function
[05:40:36] <axilla> morning all, so i've ran into this bug with chrome that causes elements when the content gets to much for chrome to handle they start dissapearing.. google instead of fixing the bug, put in a lazy fix which forces hardware acceleration.  This causes all sorts of problems because it means that the view goes from a 2D plane to a 3D plane.. that wouldn't be a problem except we position a few buttons based on the menu x/y/top/left using jqu
[05:40:43] <axilla> ?
[05:41:40] <doug64k> axilla: what makes you think anything is 3d just because it is using hardware acceleration
[05:42:45] <cuppy> I have a BUNCH of $.animate functions. I want to fire a function when all of them are complete. How can I do so?
[05:42:46] <doug64k> axilla: and even if it were 3d, how would that change x and y
[05:43:46] <doug64k> cuppy: $('.manyelements').animate(...).promise().done(function() { console.log('all done'); })
[05:44:31] <cuppy> doug64k, Oof. I was hoping it wouldn't come to that.
[05:44:42] <doug64k> what's wrong with that
[05:44:49] <doug64k> you got a better way? go for it :)
[05:45:37] <doug64k> calling promise and done too much? I don't see what you mean
[05:46:44] <cuppy> doug64k, it's just that they're all over the place, and I'm calling further animations in their animation's complete functions and I was hoping for a catch all like $.allanimationsdone()
[05:47:14] <axilla> doug64k: i think its related to this i just found it http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14956
[05:47:23] <axilla> doug64k: i'm not sure yet, i'm still researching the issue i'm seeing
[05:47:25] <doug64k> cuppy: and how would it make that work? magically know which one? brute force through the dom? keep track of a list? it's not necessary
[05:47:54] <cuppy> doug64k, I know, I know.
[05:48:49] <doug64k> axilla: that's 3d css, that has nothing to do with hardware acceleration
[05:48:53] <cuppy> doug64k, I just figured it out. I'll just call it on the last animation.
[05:49:05] <doug64k> cuppy: won't work right
[05:49:23] <doug64k> and if it does, it eventually will glitch and not work right
[05:49:42] <cuppy> doug64k, it will work.
[05:50:44] <doug64k> cuppy: you know you get 10 callbacks if you set a callback on an animation on a selector that matches 10 elements, right?
[05:50:51] <axilla> doug64k: it absolutely does because google forces you to use transform: translateZ(0) to turn on hardware acceleration
[05:50:57] <axilla> when elements are dissapearing or flashing
[05:51:01] <axilla> its a lazy ass fix..
[05:51:28] <axilla> so it converts it to a 3D element to use the GPU
[05:51:33] <axilla> and apperently that breaks jquery
[05:51:38] <axilla> because our code uses offset
[05:51:39] <doug64k> axilla: and mathematically, translateZ(0) is like multiplying x and y by 1
[05:51:42] <cuppy> doug64k, I mean my last function that animates. Not within the animation's complete function.
[05:52:56] <axilla> doug64k: https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/aa307dadaaa615ce60ed here is the code at hand
[05:53:10] <axilla> with a 2D element it works perfectly fine as you would expect
[05:53:19] <axilla> in a 3D element jquery should handle it just the same
[05:53:28] <axilla> but it doesn't.. my element is way off the page
[05:56:18] <doug64k> axilla: you seem quite convinced. did you make a minimized repro of the bug to be sure?
[05:56:56] <Bogdaniel> hello i'm having trouble with tabular data that i have from mysql. it has a set of buttons edit / delete / add and when i try to click on edit for example it always select the same data-attribute how can i make it select the data-attribute from the button that i clicked on it and not from the first row in the table
[05:57:11] <doug64k> offset just iterates through positioned parents and sums up their offsets. how would a no-op z transform affect that
[05:57:22] <doug64k> their positions
[06:03:48] <axilla> doug64k: did you read the ticket i posted?
[06:03:53] <axilla> it was reopened 4 days ago.
[06:03:59] <axilla> pretty sure they're related.
[06:08:28] <axilla> doug64k: i've tried fixing the problem from every angle and all my research leads me to believe its a jquery issue yes.. i've spent about 12hrs on this problem and i feel pretty confident i can rule out my code.. considering it works perfectly fine unless i convert it to a 3D element.
[06:08:49] <axilla> which as you said shouldn't make a lick of difference.
[06:08:56] <axilla> and i came to that same conclusion a long time ago..
[06:09:11] <axilla> me and google chrome hate each other right now :P
[06:09:49] <BillCriswell> Sounds like I missed something fun.
[06:10:25] <doug64k> axilla: can you make this misbehave like your issue http://www.jstraight.com/1120/3
[06:17:30] <doug64k> axilla: That bug says: jquery has a bug because it doesn't treat a 3d transformed element as positioned.
[06:18:00] <doug64k> it does not say that googles browser fix was to make everything everywhere be relative positioned and therefore .offset never works anymore
[06:18:40] <doug64k> and if it makes the body 3d, that won't affect jquery's offset() implementation
[06:18:59] <Fraz> hey
[06:19:27] <Fraz> how would i go about setting up a nested list to be both sortable and have droppable elements?
[06:19:48] <doug64k> Fraz: call sortable and draggable on them
[06:20:00] <frank__> Good afternoon. Anyone feel like helping out with some jQuery? Pretty basic stuff, I pay 0.01 BTC. Skype me at user ID: viewtendence or send a PM.
[06:20:04] <doug64k> droppable*
[06:20:04] <Fraz> wont they conflict with eachother?
[06:20:07] <doug64k> no
[06:20:12] <Fraz> oh
[06:20:30] <doug64k> Fraz: fairly sure they won't...
[06:20:52] <doug64k> if you had a draggable somewhere else to drop onto them, then it would make sense for the droppable to kick in only there
[06:21:54] <WeeJeWel> I'm looking for a plugin that allows me to have 3 columns, where the first is fixed width, and the other 2 dynamic width by dragging a seperator line. Suggestion?
[06:24:01] <Fraz> any idea how id make it so a sortable element will only sort if i drag it all the way before or all the way after another sortable element?
[06:24:53] <Fraz> atm they sort if the element go slighty out of the other elements bounds
[06:31:40] <mintux> why this text hide?

[07:37:45] <Jhypi> helllo
[07:37:48] <Jhypi> hello*
[07:39:16] <cuppy> I'm having trouble getting an an image's height(). Sometimes, it populates. Other times, it returns 0. I've also tried clientHeight, which gives me the same unreliable results. Possibly part of the problem is that in some cases the images are loaded offscreen. But even if I set them into a div that's 0.1 opacity onscreen, I still have the same results. Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong?
[07:39:28] <cannap> ah the plugin is the problem :/
[07:39:33] <cuppy> Also, the images are preloaded.
[07:48:01] <NoiseEee> cuppy: presumably they haven't finished loading before you check the height
[07:48:27] <cuppy> NoiseEee, must they _finish_ loading?
[07:48:36] <NoiseEee> cuppy: uh yeah
[07:48:45] <NoiseEee> can't measure somethings that not there
[07:49:35] <NoiseEee> cuppy: the good thing is that you will find images have a load event, and jquery can help you along via http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:51:06] <cuppy> NoiseEee, I find that hard to believe. The image has certainly _begun_ to load (as in transfer from the server or load from cache) by the time I attempt to get the height. Does it not know what box to fill?
[07:51:29] <NoiseEee> you're asking the browser about the height of the image.
[07:51:32] <NoiseEee> you're not asking a cache
[07:51:38] <NoiseEee> the image is not there yet!
[07:54:42] <cuppy> NoiseEee, I preload it before populating a div. After I populate a div with the image, I then ask for its height. Is it not nearly immediately in the DOM after I $("#mydiv").html(myimage), especially if using cache?
[07:59:45] <NoiseEee> cuppy: use a debugger and observe for yourself. what does 'preload' mean to you?
[08:00:06] <NoiseEee> if you've loaded the image elsewhere, why not ask for it before you put it in the div?
[08:00:12] <cuppy> NoiseEee, loading from server into cache
[08:00:19] <NoiseEee> that doesnt mean anything
[08:00:23] <NoiseEee> you don't get access to the cache
[08:00:27] <NoiseEee> you get access to the DOM
[08:00:39] <NoiseEee> if you depend on images being loaded, work the 'load' event into your images
[08:02:52] <cannap> stoned you know what to do :D
[08:03:06] <cannap> woot
[08:03:22] <Gmac_> when i use offset().top on a class i get one number, but on a [data-something] of same element i get a different number
[08:03:34] <Gmac_> ?
[08:03:50] <Gmac_> same element targeting different selectors and getting fdifferent numbers
[08:10:07] <decx> fiddle up
[08:10:18] <Gmac_> me?
[08:10:23] <decx> yes

[08:31:16] <Gmac_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Eajub
[08:31:20] <Gmac_> the codepen works
[08:31:27] <Gmac_> why wont the real thing i made work its the same!?
[08:32:44] <Gmac_> fixed it
[08:32:47] <Gmac_> well that was fun
[08:36:20] <decx> so what was it Gmac_
[08:36:38] <Gmac_> an error on my part of course
[08:36:51] <stoned> huh
[08:37:03] <stoned> cannap, what are you doing here?
[08:37:13] <stoned> I did not know you were into web dev etc.
[08:37:18] <stoned> That's cool! :)
[08:37:32] <cannap> whois me then you see ^^
[08:37:47] <stoned> [cannap] ##stoned #jquery
[08:37:53] <stoned> I only see two.
[08:37:59] <cannap> ah other channels hidden dont know why
[08:38:06] <cannap> dont talk here about this^^
[08:38:13] <stoned> 10-4
[08:39:03] <stoned> cannap, it's cool however. I'm known around these parts for a good part of a decade or more. Been queryign the 'J' for years too! :D
[08:39:15] <stoned> That is when I can spell.
[08:39:23] <stoned> Carry on :)
[08:40:37] <decx> 10 years eh, that explains the name
[08:41:07] <stoned> Yessir :)
[08:41:20] <stoned> How are you doing decx ?
[08:41:35] <decx> it's friday afternoon so i'm your name
[08:42:55] <stoned> I'm very happy to know that and to make your acquaintance
[08:43:13] <stoned> I too am myself. But if I wasn't myself, who would I be? :)
[08:43:28] <decx> just had a dürüm and try to figure out a way to unify pulling posts with specific hashtags from isntagram, facebook twitter and about 10 other services
[08:43:58] <stoned> what's there to figure?
[08:44:18] <stoned> Each sever has different api, so you need at least 1 function or class per site
[08:44:19] <decx> busywork interacting with all these apis
[08:44:40] <decx> and auths
[08:44:45] <stoned> obviously the only abstraction you'd need is the actual query, an arry holding api keys for various sites
[08:44:54] <stoned> oauth tokens and/or access tokens
[08:45:07] <stoned> well start w/ one and go one by one
[08:45:20] <maddtech> I'm trying to write a countdown timer that if a page is refreshed will start it over.  Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong?  http://www.codeshare.io/imjjz
[08:45:26] <decx> it wont work out today i giggled at the word token -.-
[08:45:41] <stoned> I love the word token
[08:46:10] <stoned> back home in Pakistan, as children, we have tokens for the arcade games, not quarters. You got 6 tokens for 5 rupees. :D Anyway, I digest.
[08:46:29] <stoned> decx, I did something like this for my bot in python
[08:46:52] <Gmac_> crap im still having same issues
[08:47:01] <decx> my uncle worked in an arcade and everytime i visited i got some sort of magic key for all the machines
[08:47:31] <stoned> abstract the superclass, subclass api and connectivity, abstract the keys and queries
[08:48:11] <robertmaxrees> maddtech you're getting that deadline variable once - you need to re-run that logic in your interval.
[08:48:24] <P0rk> Okay, I can't remember this for some reason. How do I append some html immediately after something?
[08:48:40] <decx> .after()
[08:48:52] <P0rk> Didn't work at all. No error either
[08:48:56] <robertmaxrees> or insertAfter()
[08:49:03] <P0rk> lemme try that.
[08:49:05] <robertmaxrees> dependin on the order of your stuff.
[08:49:14] <maddtech> How do I do that?
[08:49:41] <decx> insertAfter is like appendTo
[08:49:53] <robertmaxrees> maddtech by literally moving that line into the interval call?
[08:49:59] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/fvcsc0u2/4/
[08:50:05] <P0rk> insertAfter did it.
[08:50:17] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/fvcsc0u2/3 shows .after()
[08:50:25] <P0rk> thanks guys.
[08:50:37] <robertmaxrees> P0rk go check out the docs to see the difference between the two :)
[08:51:09] <decx> element.after(inserted) vs inserted.insertAfter(element)
[08:51:10] <maddtech> I'm a jquery noob so I have no clue how to do that.
[08:51:25] <robertmaxrees> maddtech you're not using any JQ there - that's all plain JS.
[08:51:53] <maddtech> okay.  would it be better to use JQ or plain js?
[08:51:59] <robertmaxrees> oh except for the doc ready.
[08:52:05] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't really matter which you do.
[08:52:06] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:52:44] <maddtech> Okay
[08:52:52] <decx> is there afiddle?
[08:52:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bcfq9ffu/ - what is the countdown function?
[08:53:49] <decx> i think i have something similar
[08:53:58] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5fc0abr7/
[08:54:09] <robertmaxrees> hah
[08:54:39] <BillCriswell> decx: 'tadaaa' is a good touch.
[08:54:56] <decx> ^^
[08:54:58] <robertmaxrees> maddtech yeah, your code sample isn't complete.  the other issue is you set that deadline variable once and then write it out every second, which will just write in that same value over and over.
[08:55:34] <maddtech> Okay.  I just need it to countdown 30 minutes.  I need to see minutes and seconds.
[08:55:49] <robertmaxrees> maddtech look at what decx sent out and see if that helps.
[08:56:50] <doug64k> maddtech: sounds sexagesimal
[09:00:31] <P0rk> can anyone verify that both jsbin and jsfiddle are down or is it just me?
[09:01:07] <decx> both work for me
[09:01:16] <varchar> same here
[09:01:16] <P0rk> what could cause that?
[09:01:25] <doug64k> P0rk: http://www.isup.me/
[09:01:48] <decx> your isp could have problems
[09:02:02] <doug64k> P0rk: router glitch
[09:02:04] <P0rk> doug64k, bookmarked that. Thanks. It's just me. Comcast ftw
[09:02:04] <dmsuperman> or your face could have problems
[09:02:06] <decx> or the ixp
[09:02:39] <robertmaxrees> well that was a bummer
[09:03:11] <P0rk> back up... peculiar..
[09:03:16] <robertmaxrees> AWS probably.
[09:03:42] <BillCriswell> Someone needs to turn the internet on and off again.
[09:04:20] <doug64k> BillCriswell: exactly!
[09:04:47] <robertmaxrees> we couldn't reach heroku, netflix, hipchat, etc.
[09:04:51] <robertmaxrees> all amazon hosted stuff.
[09:05:19] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I just blame comcast all the time.
[09:05:22] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:05:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm not even sure what i'm on right now.
[09:05:47] * Robdgreat takes that out of context
[09:05:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[09:06:04] <robertmaxrees> it's friday.  i just want to play with our kegbot.
[09:06:15] <BillCriswell> I have a list of really boring shit I need to do.
[09:06:18] <dmsuperman> kegbot!?!
[09:06:22] <dmsuperman> do tell
[09:06:24] <BillCriswell> I figured out all the exciting stuff monday by noon.
[09:06:28] <robertmaxrees> https://kegbot.org/ dmsuperman
[09:06:37] <dmsuperman> amazing
[09:06:42] <dmsuperman> do you have an office keg?
[09:06:45] <robertmaxrees> Work paid for the entire set, too.
[09:07:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.  converted an old fridge to a kegerator, mounted a tap on it and everything.
[09:07:14] <dmsuperman> that's one thing I miss about working in an office. working from home has its pros (bong on the desk for example hahahaha) but I always missed office beer socials
[09:07:39] <robertmaxrees> one of the perks for working at a home improvement company: we have lots of random shit like that laying around.
[09:07:44] <dmsuperman> lol nice
[09:07:56] <dmsuperman> damn that is pretty neat
[09:08:32] <robertmaxrees> the sinks and faucets in the bathrooms are all different because we get free ones all the time.  same with the ones in the kitchens and break rooms.
[09:08:54] <decx> do you have a lifesized tim allen cutout?
[09:09:08] <robertmaxrees> no, but now i know we need one.
[09:09:15] <decx> right!
[09:09:18] <robertmaxrees> we have lifesize archer and iron man and some other stuff floating around.
[09:09:35] <decx> life sized tim allen cutout with a coke dispenser
[09:09:49] <axilla> doug64k: so i maganged to figure out WHAT is causing the chrome bug in the first place.. i may be able to fix it without worrying about the jquery issue :D
[09:10:11] <axilla> i'm using dynatree to create our catalog_tree and the length of a childs name is whats causing the original bug in chrome
[09:10:17] <stoned> decx, when you get a chance, check out what Nugs sent you
[09:18:19] <ciqsteve> Q:  I need to display a notification message to a user, and have it stay there for about 5 seconds, then automatically disappear..  during these 5 seconds the user need to be able to perform other actions involving JS... how do I do this??
[09:18:45] <fredy_> Hi, good morning
[09:19:41] <robertmaxrees> ciqsteve that's a really... vague question.
[09:20:15] <robertmaxrees> break that down and start with the notification.  get that work and the rest is pretty easy.
[09:20:35] <ciqsteve> settimeout?
[09:20:55] <fredy_> I hope everyone is having a good day. I am running out of ideas and the deadline of my project is soon, someone could help me? I am trying to use JQuery File Upload from BlueImp, FormData to send additional information and Client Side Image Resizing
[09:20:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:21:07] <ciqsteve> ok
[09:21:12] <ciqsteve> ty
[09:21:25] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're limiting the amount of time, but that's one way to handle that part.
[09:22:19] <ciqsteve> the message is confirming a user action - 'what you did worked' -- there will be many messages, so they can't just stackup, and they don't mean much after a few seconds anywway
[09:22:45] <dmsuperman> there are lots of javascripty notification libs already
[09:22:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, confirmation.  the thing about "other actions" threw me for a loop.
[09:22:51] <dmsuperman> but it should be stupid easy
[09:23:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, tons of easy ways to do something like that.
[09:23:06] <dmsuperman> just get the little popup to show with CSS and uset a setTimeout to destroy the node
[09:23:10] <dmsuperman> most of the work is going to be CSS
[09:23:22] <robertmaxrees> or use the timeout to add a "hide" class to do.
[09:23:23] <robertmaxrees> *it
[09:23:33] <fredy_>  I hope everyone is having a good day. I am running out of ideas and the deadline of my project is soon, someone could help me? I am trying to use JQuery File Upload from BlueImp, FormData to send additional information and Client Side Image Resizing. Help please...
[09:23:46] <dmsuperman> chill out fredy_
[09:23:46] <robertmaxrees> fredy_ we saw the question the first time - no need to spam :)
[09:23:51] <ciqsteve> dmsuperman - yeah, but I'm kindof off 3rd party libs - too much black box code floating around.. often find myself spending more time trying to implement the one feature they lack than it would take to just write it from scratch
[09:23:54] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ fredy_
[09:23:54] <b-ot> fredy_: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:24:16] <dmsuperman> ciqsteve: yeah but something like this would be trivial to understand. but also trivial to write yourself, so I don't blame you writing your own
[09:24:33] <fredy_> sorry :/
[09:24:35] <dmsuperman> something to consider is what happens if they get 2 notifications at the same time
[09:24:40] <dmsuperman> do they start stacking up, etc
[09:24:41] <ciqsteve> dms &rmr - thanks as always
[09:28:26] <fredy_> well, here is my code, http://pastebin.com/K3vWqe2p I was looking and trying many ways How to do it but until now without success...
[09:28:55] <robertmaxrees> fredy_ where are you getting stuf?
[09:28:57] <robertmaxrees> *stuck
[09:30:01] <doug64k> "You know what I like about deadlines? The whooshing noise they make as they fly by"
[09:30:06] <robertmaxrees> also, your formData prop is repeated twice.
[09:30:07] <fredy_>   formData: [{ name: 'name', value: 'firstname' }, { name: 'lastname', value: 'lastname' }], => insted of 'firstname' it will be the input value. I tried with $('#fname').val(); and it did not work
[09:30:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah because you're repeating that prop and it's breaking things.
[09:30:53] <fredy_> oops, the second was another try
[09:31:44] <robertmaxrees> bu yeah, you should be able to just do $('#fname').val() to get the value.  [{ name: $('#fname').val(), value: 'firstname' }], should work just fine.
[09:31:48] <fredy_> I tried creating a new FormData, it did not work
[09:31:58] <robertmaxrees> (or wherever you want tha value.
[09:32:25] <robertmaxrees> what exactly isn't working with this btw?
[09:32:48] <fredy_> [{ name: 'fname', value: $('#fname').val() }] -> I tried this too and I get an empty string
[09:33:27] <doug64k> fredy_: you probably have duplicate ids in the html
[09:33:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:33:37] <robertmaxrees> or something is deleting the input.
[09:33:45] <robertmaxrees> or you have something else going on.
[09:33:58] <robertmaxrees> onclick="mensaje()" worries me.
[09:34:24] <doug64k> yes, dont attach event handlers with attributes. this isnt netscape anymore
[09:34:37] <abailarri> Hello. I want to replace some html with a click function, but I don't know how to do. Any help please? http://jsfiddle.net/oku1wu0j/4/
[09:34:54] <fredy_> thanks doug64k, I took a look and I don't have duplicate ids
[09:35:13] <robertmaxrees> abailarri is it possible for you to add a span or something around the text you want to replace?
[09:35:15] <robertmaxrees> that'll make it much easier.
[09:35:27] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, is not possible
[09:35:27] <doug64k> fredy_: did you try $('#fname') in the debugger console in the browser?
[09:35:44] <P0rk> dmsuperman, do you happen to remember that excellent radio button simulation from yesterday? I am having a hard time writing it as succinctly as you did.
[09:35:51] <abailarri> this is the reason why I don't know to do ;) robertmaxrees
[09:35:52] <fredy_> that is the funny part, It get the current value
[09:36:38] <doug64k> fredy_: and you're submitting with ajax?
[09:37:27] <doug64k> fredy_: did you have code to look at? I missed it if so
[09:37:44] <robertmaxrees> abailarri also, you can't create random attributes like that.
[09:37:51] <robertmaxrees>  messid="10" isn't valid.
[09:37:55] <fredy_> yes doug64k, here is my code : http://pastebin.com/VPSAa3ba
[09:38:14] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, why? In my real app I use this attr to make some ajax query
[09:38:18] <P0rk> nvm, got it. Thanks dmsuperman
[09:38:25] <robertmaxrees> because it's not valid html, abailarri
[09:39:34] <doug64k> fredy_: you are wrapping it too much according to https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/How-to-submit-additional-form-data
[09:39:50] <doug64k> it expects formData: { name: 'val', name2: 'val2' } etc
[09:40:00] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, since html5 this is admited http://www.intergraphicdesigns.com/blog/2012/09/06/atributos-personalizados-para-html5-y-javascript/
[09:40:16] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are allowd.
[09:40:23] <robertmaxrees> nothing else is allowed.
[09:40:27] <robertmaxrees> you need top prepend with data-*
[09:40:34] <robertmaxrees> data-messid is valid.
[09:40:36] <robertmaxrees> messid is not.
[09:40:45] <abailarri> ok
[09:40:45] <doug64k> abailarri: if you want to make your own attribute named foo the attribute must be data-foo
[09:40:58] <doug64k> to follow the html5 spec. what you can get away with now is subject to change
[09:41:20] <robertmaxrees> abailarri either way, you need to use .contents() and .filter() to get the node you wnat.
[09:42:52] <fredy_> dougk64 http://pastebin.com/U7RsdwFa -> my new code, it doesn't work...
[09:43:07] <robertmaxrees> fredy_ btw saying "it doesn't work..." is one of the least helpful things you can do.
[09:43:17] <robertmaxrees> explain how it's broken instead.
[09:43:21] <doug64k> fredy_: that is wrong
[09:43:33] <doug64k> fredy_: serialize array does not encode it like I said
[09:43:46] <fredy_> oic, more details: now the string i get is "Nothing" ( I am using ASP.net VB for backend)
[09:45:00] <doug64k> var postdata = {}; $('form1').serializeArray().forEach(function(v) { postdata[v.name] = v.value; }); ... then use postdata in the fileupload call
[09:45:22] <doug64k> fredy_: ^
[09:46:21] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, and this? http://jsfiddle.net/oku1wu0j/5/
[09:46:29] <fredy_> doug64k thank you! I am going to try
[09:48:01] <fredy_> ** !!!!! Thank you so much doug64k!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09:48:08] <doug64k> np
[09:49:14] <doug64k> fredy_: the way serializearray encodes it, it can have duplicate names, so it stores all these separate objects in separate array elements. the way fileupload wants it, duplicate names dont work. but who needs duplicate names?
[09:49:19] <fredy_> now I go for the next step: client side resizing with those libraries, the most difficult part is completed!! Thank you so much doug64k, God and Internet bless you
[09:50:39] <doug64k> :)
[09:53:45] <robertmaxrees> abailarri i thought you said you couldn't wrap that text in an element...
[09:53:52] <robertmaxrees> in that case, use .text() against it.
[09:54:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oku1wu0j/8/ bam done
[10:04:03] <doug64k> so google is trying to get into the android market. no not the phone. Like commander data :D
[10:05:26] <doug64k> when those chrome colored guys are shooting at you in 2019, just remember all the sites you built that use the google cdn
[10:08:45] <doug64k> I learned recently that they have acquired a huge number of AI and robotics companies
[10:10:40] <doug64k> makes me want to get a terminator chrome skull and align it so the oo in Google are the eyes
[10:13:00] <doug64k> perhaps a droid aiming a gun at you with a caption "Are you feeling lucky"
[10:14:49] <jaccob> http://jsfiddle.net/guc4tL8d/ surprise surprise, even buttons submit forms
[10:15:30] <doug64k> jaccob: has nothing to do with the button. click anywhere in the form to submit
[10:15:50] <jaccob> doug64k, I dont understand
[10:15:56] <doug64k> jaccob: you need .on('submit', function(e) ...
[10:16:01] <doug64k> and select the form element
[10:16:40] <jaccob> doug64k, yes, if I want to submit the form, but in this case I just wanted to examine the serliaze string
[10:16:49] <doug64k> take your code with the mysterious button behavior, then just click anywhere in the empty space of the form. it will submit
[10:17:02] <jaccob> doug64k, I did that, but it didn'
[10:18:28] <doug64k> jaccob: yes it does. you had the wrong id: http://jsfiddle.net/guc4tL8d/1/
[10:18:33] <doug64k> click the text
[10:18:42] <doug64k> it will print in the console "submit! etc..."
[10:19:14] <doug64k> event bubbling
[10:19:36] <doug64k> the text node gets the click, no handler there, so it tries its parent, then its parent, etc, until a handler is found
[10:19:37] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events explains things pretty okay.
[10:19:38] <jaccob> doug64k, oh yeah I see
[10:19:47] <robertmaxrees> doug64k and that's not exactly how it works.
[10:20:18] <robertmaxrees> well, at least not in the native model.
[10:20:42] <jaccob> doug64k, I didn't have the wrong id, I wasn't trying to submit the form, I was just serializing and looking at the string, cause I was interested in creating my own with out html
[10:20:42] <robertmaxrees> which jquery tries to emulate as well as it can, but does it on steroids.
[10:22:35] <jaccob> doug64k, I am planning on adding stuff to the serialized string, and then submitting the form using $("#myform").submit(); see what I mean? Thats why I was annoyed that the button was submitting the form unexpectedly
[10:22:55] <doug64k> jaccob: to do that, you should use on submit
[10:22:56] <jaccob> doug64k, but I can just use e.preventDefault() and not worried about it, but it was surpriseing
[10:23:23] <jaccob> doug64k, on submit is the event handler for submit event, I want to trigger the submit event
[10:23:40] <doug64k> even if only so the person reading the code can clearly see exactly what's going on immediately
[10:24:10] <jaccob> doug64k, c'mon doug64k
[10:24:43] <doug64k> you want to let it go through with a page reload when it posts?
[10:24:51] <doug64k> reloading the page is frowned upon imho
[10:25:05] <jaccob> doug64k, yes, cause I am going to paypal page
[10:25:22] <doug64k> ok then
[10:25:58] <doug64k> you want to populate/calculate some hidden stuff at the right moment?
[10:26:15] <jaccob> so like, when someone hits submit, I want to collect all the shopping cart items, and then build my form data, and then submit the form
[10:26:42] <doug64k> ya, you can do that with on submit right? just modify the input type=hidden all you want
[10:27:22] <doug64k> real reason: on submit is guaranteed to get called properly
[10:27:29] <jaccob> doug64k, I don't want to put all that in the html, I want to add those hidden html elements into my serialized string by hand
[10:28:00] <jaccob> doug64k, you saying submitting on form with jquery $("#myform").submit() is not reliable
[10:28:07] <doug64k> a browser or accessibility device could cause a submit that bypasses your ui (I think)
[10:28:40] <jaccob> doug64k, yeah, gotta use e.preventDefault()
[10:28:55] <doug64k> jaccob: no, I am saying, if you NEED something to do some post-processing step before submitting, it really should be on submit, because that is GUARANTEED to be called, no matter what the user does or how they cause it
[10:29:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:29:29] <robertmaxrees> you need to prevent default, run your logic, then submit again manually for best results.
[10:29:52] <jaccob> So how about if I don't use a form at all?
[10:30:26] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to POST data?
[10:30:41] <doug64k> jaccob: location.replace with a GET style url to paypal?
[10:31:28] <jaccob> it has to be post
[10:31:33] <doug64k> or fabricate a form out of thin air in code and submit it :)   or modify the on-page form and perform the manual submit as robertmaxrees mentioned.
[10:31:48] <jaccob> doug64k, yeah, fabricate a form in code
[10:32:07] <doug64k> jaccob: in your case probably not. but it could be a reasonable approach
[10:32:22] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, yes post
[10:32:41] <robertmaxrees> jaccob then yeah, you have to usea form or AJAX.  paypal probably only allows the form.
[10:33:26] <jaccob> How do you build a form in script, just $("document").append("<form ..></form>");
[10:33:58] <jaccob> You have to append it to the page to be able to Post it?
[10:34:31] <jaccob> Ahh, using a form and modifiying is easy enough and convenient enough
[10:35:26] <jaccob> thx guys
[10:35:27] <doug64k> var form = $('<form/'); Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(v) { form.append($('<input/>').attr('type', 'hidden').attr('name', v).val(obj[v]); })
[10:35:32] <doug64k> perhaps
[10:36:12] <doug64k> oops, s/<form'/<form\/>'/
[10:38:12] <doug64k> and attr in the action
[10:38:41] <robertmaxrees> .prop it in, actually.
[10:39:54] <doug64k> var form = $('<form/>').prop('action', 'https://...'); ... etc
[10:40:09] <doug64k> you can very easily synthesize anything in jquery
[10:40:34] <doug64k> but keep it to a minimum - put html in html
[10:40:37] <robertmaxrees> or var form = $('<form/>', {'action': 'someURL.com', 'method': 'get'});
[10:40:40] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways to do it.
[10:40:43] <doug64k> in this case it isnt visual
[10:41:31] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: yes I avoid that shorthand a bit because it can cause unexpected calls to methods
[10:41:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?  like what?
[10:41:52] <doug64k> it's in the docs. let me see if I can find it
[10:42:10] <doug64k> I know right? that surprised me
[10:44:14] <doug64k> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/ then find text in page: as of jquery 1.8
[10:44:31] <robertmaxrees> sure - that's not a problem to me.
[10:44:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not unexpected at all imo.
[10:45:01] <doug64k> you expect width: 100 to call width(100)
[10:45:03] <doug64k> that's why
[10:45:12] <robertmaxrees> i don't use width ever on html.
[10:45:16] <robertmaxrees> i use CSS almost always.
[10:45:29] <doug64k> just elaborating on why I use the longhand for that
[10:45:38] <robertmaxrees> but i could see some people being surprised by that one.
[10:45:53] <NinjaBanjo> why would jquery be calculting a slideToggle backworks. element is hidden, then displays full and slides closed
[10:46:02] <doug64k> I can easily see bugs slipping in where you thought it made sense to say width there, and you have to spot it later
[10:48:09] <doug64k> NinjaBanjo: because you probably have x number of animations going, causing x number of callbacks - where you thought you were going to get one
[10:48:36] <NinjaBanjo> doug64k, I added preventDefault and it worked. apparently it was causing multiple events to fire
[10:48:44] <doug64k> then those spammed callbacks cause whatever that animates to do weird stuff
[10:48:52] <NinjaBanjo> only happened on iphone
[10:50:20] <robertmaxrees> doug64k that's why i pointed out i don't do things like defining a width using markup in the first place.  that'd include in that function.  but like I said, i could see other people getting bitten by that.
[10:51:00] <doug64k> NinjaBanjo: also, as a general rule of thumb, don't use slideToggle without a parameter that tells it which way to go. make your code know what it is doing. toggle reversal bugs can easily creep in
[10:52:02] <NinjaBanjo> doug64k, it's for a simple menu slideout, works fine.
[10:52:21] <NinjaBanjo> I use the complete function and .stop() to control looping, never done me wrong before
[10:57:07] <doug64k> NinjaBanjo: it's easy to do multiple animations and properly wait for them all to finish, then get one callback
[10:57:22] <doug64k> if you need that
[10:57:40] <doug64k> animation promises are a FAQ the last couple of days :)
[10:57:45] <NinjaBanjo> doug64k, I don't, but thanks for the options.
[10:57:55] <NinjaBanjo> I know how to handle promises
[10:58:00] <NinjaBanjo> I do not.js work
[10:58:01] <NinjaBanjo> node*
[10:58:18] <doug64k> ok
[10:58:40] <NinjaBanjo> I do appreciate the offer though :D i love to see helpful people about these channels
[10:58:51] <doug64k> NinjaBanjo: then you might know promises *too* well. jquery promises are strange compared to the real ones
[11:00:22] <NinjaBanjo> don't they call them "deferred"
[11:00:30] <NinjaBanjo> or something nonsensical
[11:00:34] <doug64k> yes
[11:00:55] <doug64k> a promise is a deferred that you cant resolve or reject (made kind of read only)
[11:01:29] <robertmaxrees> they're changing jquery promises are changing btw.
[11:01:35] <robertmaxrees> making them spec compliant.
[11:01:46] <doug64k> so you can wrap it with a promise and give it to someone that is blocked from screwing up the logic by resolving it themself (because they are an idiot or it is a bug)
[11:04:26] <Fishy> how can i use inArray to search an array of objects for duplicates?
[11:05:09] <doug64k> Fishy: I wouldn't do that. that would be O(n^2) right?
[11:05:47] <doug64k> make a temp object, walk the array, check for a property and if it already exists, its a dup, else add that property.
[11:06:01] <doug64k> that would be at least O(n log n) at worst
[11:06:01] <Fishy> alright
[11:06:11] <robertmaxrees> depends on if memory or computational speed is more important though, right?
[11:06:14] <Fishy> thanks
[11:06:24] <Fishy> its a very small array
[11:06:33] <robertmaxrees> and that method is flawed because you'd have to look at the new array to see if the object already exists anyway.
[11:06:59] <doug64k> all the extra code that you would write to do it without the temp object would likely overwhelm the temp object size
[11:06:59] <robertmaxrees> unless you swap to using a plain object with named keys.
[11:07:51] <doug64k> if it's small*
[11:10:28] <doug64k> whenever you have a thought (oooh I could save a few bytes if I do all this extra work), consider that the extra work is more code size. so what did you save?
[11:10:41] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm arguing for.
[11:10:42] <robertmaxrees> but okay
[11:10:57] <doug64k> just exaggerating the point I made earlier, not addressing your comments :)
[11:11:18] <doug64k> speaking in general
[11:13:27] <DeltaHeavy> Is there a better way to write this line?         this.$topNavSearchText.add(this.$suggestiveSearchText).keypress(function (event) {
[11:13:44] <DeltaHeavy> Any alternatives to .add() without the selector being a string?
[11:14:01] <robertmaxrees> .add() doesn't update the original collection btw.
[11:14:12] <DeltaHeavy> Damn,..should have tested that...sec
[11:14:25] <doug64k> DeltaHeavy: give it an array of elements
[11:14:40] <doug64k> $(...my array of elements...)
[11:15:09] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I just want to ALSO attach an event to $suggestiveSearchText. That works right?
[11:15:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd bind a delegated listener and do it that was instead, but what you've got should function.
[11:15:53] <DeltaHeavy> doug64k: So it could be       $([this.$topNavSearchText, this.$suggestiveSearchText]).keypress(function (event) {       ?
[11:16:12] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: i usually would but these are single instances that use IDs
[11:16:14] <doug64k> DeltaHeavy: that should work yes
[11:16:18] <DeltaHeavy> $topNavSearchText: $('#topNavSearch'),
[11:16:38] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Would you still delegate it if there will only be two instances of this event listner?
[11:16:54] <doug64k> DeltaHeavy: you are optimizing right? avoiding a whole new selector lookup like '#id1, #id2, #etc' ?
[11:16:55] <robertmaxrees> depends on what i'm doing.  I'm semi-obsessed with them tbh.
[11:17:03] <DeltaHeavy> Perhaps I shuold...
[11:17:58] <doug64k> why wouldn't you. if you dont have any issues delegating then do that imho
[11:18:16] <doug64k> who doesnt want less event listeners in the dom
[11:19:35] <doug64k> DeltaHeavy: btw you can very easily test against the event target with var targ = $(event.target); if (targ.is('selector')) ...
[11:20:02] <robertmaxrees> there's also the `this` object within the listener.
[11:20:08] <doug64k> otherwise I suggest traverse from there typically with closest/find
[11:21:28] <DeltaHeavy> doug64k: COol, did'nt know that either
[11:21:31] <DeltaHeavy> Ended up doing this - $(document).on('keypress', [this.$topNavSearchText, this.$suggestiveSearchText], function (event) {
[11:21:33] <DeltaHeavy> It's nice @_@
[11:21:53] <doug64k> til array delegation selector
[11:22:03] <robertmaxrees> that selector should be a string - be careful with anything else.
[11:22:15] <robertmaxrees> it'll work, it's just... funky.
[11:22:29] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: How will it work funky? How would you do it instead in my specific situation?
[11:22:45] <robertmaxrees> .on() expects a string for that second arg.
[11:22:45] <doug64k> good to know every weird way so you're ok when someone gets clever and you read their code :)
[11:22:47] <robertmaxrees> not an array.
[11:23:02] <robertmaxrees> doug64k when somebody gets clever i just reject it and tell them to not do it that way ;)
[11:24:11] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: $(document).on('keypress', [this.$topNavSearchText, this.$suggestiveSearchText].join(','), function (event) {
[11:24:15] <DeltaHeavy> This this too clever ;-;
[11:24:31] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy i'd store the string somewhere instead, but i'm weird.
[11:24:46] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what the codebase currently looks like.
[11:24:53] <doug64k> it's a 1-shot though
[11:24:55] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: It's just a one time thing though
[11:25:03] <robertmaxrees> aye - hence my last remark.
[11:25:06] <DeltaHeavy> It won't be used elsewhere. I HATE using array when they're just used once
[11:25:08] <DeltaHeavy> Gotcha
[11:25:10] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what the codebase currently looks like ;)
[11:25:48] <doug64k> DeltaHeavy: what is there to hate? thanks javascript! thanks for letting me just create an array right there in the middle of an expression :D
[11:26:06] <DeltaHeavy> trutru
[11:26:35] <doug64k> of course, do it appropriately, don't repeat yourself, etc

[12:10:27] <totesjakey> F12 doesn't work on mac :( I hate macs
[12:22:32] <cannap> why still use? :D
[12:22:57] <jphase> lol
[12:23:08] <tw2113> yo
[12:24:13] <jphase> whiRRed
[12:24:54] <jetsaredim> is it possible to combine parsley and any one of the input mask plugins for proper form validation?
[12:26:04] <jetsaredim> for example, if I want to store a phone number in my db as just the numbers, but in the input form i want there to be an input mask that displays the phone number as (nnn) nnn-nnnn while the user is typing, how can i accomplish this
[12:26:19] <jphase> validation libraries that don't including masking on their own can often be problematic with each other
[12:26:39] <jphase> I've done it before, not with parsley, but with others
[12:26:47] <jetsaredim> maybe i missed it in the docs but does parsley have input masking?
[12:26:59] <jphase> it can be a pain since most of them insert ____ chars, or whatever your mask is, into the input
[12:27:06] <jetsaredim> yea exactly
[12:27:07] <jphase> not that I recall, no
[12:27:21] <jphase> you have to figure out how to strip your mask chars in your validation logic
[12:28:02] <jetsaredim> i assume that a validation framework like parsley does the validation on submit action of the form
[12:28:29] <jphase> most of them do, yes
[12:28:32] <jetsaredim> so basically need a constructor to strip out the mask before running the validation
[12:28:51] <jphase> you can do that, which can act a lil' ghetto hehe
[12:28:59] <jphase> but yes, that can work
[12:29:15] <jphase> the hard part is making it happen in the event stack before the validation is bound
[12:29:22] <jetsaredim> right
[12:30:25] <jetsaredim> is there a "better" validation plugin than parsley?
[12:30:34] <jphase> meh, it's all subjective
[12:30:54] <jphase> you'll have the same problems with other libraries anyhow, so use what you're most comfortable with imo
[12:32:28] <jetsaredim> its all a learning experience at this point so i don't really have a personal perference
[12:33:14] <P0rk> does the html input attribute "pattern" work very well for input masking?
[12:33:37] <jetsaredim> the issue is not storing the input mask with the input
[12:34:09] <jetsaredim> eg a phone number with mask would look like (123) 456-7890 vs storing 1234567890 in the db
[12:35:15] <jetsaredim> it's a crude example but when you store things as numbers/integers vs strings it makes things much easier to sort
[12:35:30] <jetsaredim> or should i say - less costly
[12:36:10] <P0rk> So the pattern regex attribute includes the mask? or it doesn't?
[12:36:19] <P0rk> it seems like it would depend on the regex.
[12:36:50] <jetsaredim> for a form the mask gets included in the form field data
[12:37:11] <jetsaredim> or so my - albeit limited - test shows
[12:37:19] <doug64k> jetsaredim: dropping that information means that international numbers are probably not possible
[12:37:42] <P0rk> unless split into subcomponent fields.
[12:37:58] <doug64k> unless your code knows how to reconstitute any stripped international number
[12:38:09] <doug64k> just a thought, carry on
[12:38:26] <jetsaredim> phone number is just an example that people will understand - it's not the actual use case
[12:38:40] <jetsaredim> it's probably a bad example because it's too well-known
[12:39:27] <doug64k> ok
[12:39:30] <P0rk> seems like what you are looking for is a hash function. That could minimize the storage through logical compression.
[12:39:48] <jetsaredim> basically just a 9-digit number in groups of three
[12:40:14] <jetsaredim> P0rk: not sure what you mean
[12:40:37] <doug64k> P0rk: that mechanism is annoying isn't it?
[12:40:45] <doug64k> the pattern thing
[12:41:06] <P0rk> I think a 9 digit number in a group of three could be easily expressed as bitshifted numbers 3 long maybe
[12:41:34] <doug64k> html5 pattern thing*
[12:42:23] <P0rk> agreed...
[12:42:45] <P0rk> course without regexbuddy, I could not do a regex to save my life
[12:43:04] <doug64k> to match (123) 456-7890?
[12:43:30] <P0rk> nice try conveniently leaving out the international optional prefixes, lol
[12:43:34] <doug64k>  /^\(\d{3}\)\ \d{3}-\d{4}$/
[12:43:40] <P0rk> and the fact that there are no 123 area codes
[12:44:03] <P0rk> or 0nn area codes.
[12:44:50] <jetsaredim> yes, hence my supposition that the phone number input is an already solved problem
[12:44:54] <doug64k> js> print("(123) 456-7890".match(/^\(\d{3}\)\ \d{3}-\d{4}$/))
[12:44:57] <b-ot> doug64k: (123) 456-7890
[12:45:12] <doug64k> you don't check for valid phone numbers in a regex!
[12:45:20] <doug64k> you crazy?
[12:45:38] <doug64k> that type of decision shouldn't be made in a regex pattern
[12:45:57] <doug64k> format and structure can be verified
[12:46:21] <doug64k> js> print("(123) 45hhh6-7890".match(/^\(\d{3}\)\ \d{3}-\d{4}$/))
[12:46:26] <b-ot> doug64k: null
[12:47:06] <P0rk> sure, but part of the format is knowing that the first integer in the area code is never 0
[12:47:15] <P0rk> for example
[12:47:35] <doug64k> P0rk: if you start micromanaging like that, it's a slippery slope and you end up with a big mess regex.
[12:47:58] <P0rk> trust me, i have slipped down that slope a number of messy times.
[12:48:13] <P0rk> Now, I have a service that validates phone numbers. LOL
[12:48:17] <doug64k> you can do that... /^\([1-9]\d{2}\) ...
[12:50:18] <doug64k> an international number starts with 011 right? there you go, your zero-blocking prevented them from putting in a phone number
[12:50:27] <P0rk> I think the last time I cared about phone numbers I used https://www.cdyne.com/api/phone-verification/
[12:51:00] <doug64k> I don't like gun-to-my-head formatting and validation
[12:52:04] <doug64k> 5 could be a valid phone number in an office
[12:52:30] <jetsaredim> would now be a good time to say that i've moved on
[12:56:08] <P0rk> only if you were pretty sure we were still talking about your issue and hadn't moved on to our own issues... sure
[12:57:02] <P0rk> sorry I was raised under a bridge...
[12:59:37] <unnu> so i have var a = 'some {place} with {holder}'; a.replace('{place}', 'text'); a.replace('{holder}', 'words
[12:59:46] <unnu> ');
[12:59:56] <unnu> anything wrong with that syntax or am i just stupid?
[13:00:48] <P0rk> do you need to escape the {}?
[13:00:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zcwe7sfu/
[13:00:55] <unnu> do i?
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:01:11] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't modify the string in place.
[13:01:15] <robertmaxrees> it returns the string with the changes made.
[13:01:20] <jphase>  unnu nope
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> see the fiddle for the "right" way.
[13:01:21] <jphase> that's fine

[13:02:43] <robertmaxrees> that's not Jquery btw ;)
[13:02:51] <unnu> i know
[13:02:53] <unnu> its js
[13:03:00] <unnu> .replace is built into it
[13:03:10] <unnu> i just like #jquery so i come here for questions
[13:03:15] <unnu> you guys are smart

[13:05:55] <NinjaBanjo> I hardly use touch events lol
[13:06:20] <robertmaxrees> usually you'd use jquery mobile for that, but not necessarily.
[13:06:26] <NinjaBanjo> I just need touchstart
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> you can bind to any event with jquery
[13:06:38] <NinjaBanjo> i'm binding touchstart righ tnow and nothing happens
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> try $(document).on('touchstart', function() {});
[13:07:56] <robertmaxrees> or $('body') instead of the document.
[13:08:26] <NinjaBanjo> i think i got it robertmaxrees
[13:08:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[13:09:05] <unnu> how the hell do i update the dom after load?
[13:09:14] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways.
[13:09:15] <unnu> i am using on doc ready,
[13:09:19] <robertmaxrees> define "update the dom"
[13:09:28] <unnu> div .append (twitter post)
[13:09:37] <unnu> (psudeo)
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> i assume you mean after everything has loaded?
[13:09:46] <unnu> . . . nope
[13:09:53] <unnu> just running the script at the bottom of the page
[13:10:00] <unnu> in side of a on(doc)ready
[13:10:05] <NinjaBanjo> unnu, you can't change psudo elements with js
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ready(), you mean?
[13:10:19] <unnu> XD psudo code ninjabanjo
[13:10:23] <NinjaBanjo> oh
[13:10:27] <unnu> yes robertBanjo
[13:10:32] <unnu> i didn't feel like typing that much

[13:10:39] <NinjaBanjo> ro <tab>
[13:10:53] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('ready') isn't the same, fwiw
[13:10:57] <NinjaBanjo> ni <tab> (autocompletely names unnu )

[13:11:11] <robertmaxrees> ep
[13:11:13] <robertmaxrees> *yep
[13:11:45] <unnu> okay, if i want to run a script after EVERYTHING else is done
[13:11:56] <unnu> without user input
[13:12:02] <unnu> what does i do
[13:12:30] <NinjaBanjo> unnu, well that's a loaded question, because document ready doesn't always mean that all images have finished rendering
[13:13:46] <unnu> screw images, i just wanna push twitter posts to a damn div
[13:13:57] <unnu> lol
[13:14:08] * unnu is trying to be cynical and funny
[13:15:33] <NinjaBanjo> then $(document).ready(function(){//code goes here})
[13:16:02] <hollusion> why does var array = $(object).map(function(){return $(this).data(json)});
[13:16:09] <hollusion> not result in an array of objects?
[13:16:36] <hollusion> shouldnt it?
[13:16:57] <NinjaBanjo> hollusion, jqueyr data doesn't always bind to html attr, jQuery makes a psuedo data set
[13:17:03] <NinjaBanjo> could be related
[13:17:15] <hollusion> the data part works, i get the correct json
[13:17:26] <hollusion> but the reult is an object with items as properties
[13:17:38] <hollusion> and not an array with items as elements
[13:17:46] <unnu> okay, so maybe its that i am loading it in a diffrent file? idk even
[13:18:32] <unnu> but in my .js file if i $('.twitterDiv').append('Damnit Bobby'); it doesn't show up, but if i do it at the bottom of the file in some <script> tags it does . . . .
[13:18:53] <unnu> i am loading the .js file just after jquery
[13:19:19] <unnu> i am so confused
[13:22:21] <unnu> anyone?
[13:22:33] <hollusion> had to use array.get() to get what i want
[13:22:55] <hollusion> unnu
[13:23:28] <hollusion> "this is your code" now put this around $(function() {}); to make it look like $(function() {"this is your code"})
[13:23:37] <hollusion> ; at the end
[13:32:42] <stuck_ed> I'm trying to show a sub menu indicator image when i hover over the sub menu http://www.imagefix.co.uk/dando_demo/ (check dental service menu) but failing to do so can you help me here
[13:32:44] <unnu> yay my power sucks
[13:34:11] <unnu> anyway
[13:34:35] <unnu> console.log(data) works, console.log(twitterPost) works, but i cant .append the div
[13:37:57] <kegster> so i have a var that is set to true, then i do an .each() across multiple objects, and if i flag something, i need that var to be false, THEN once everything is done looping through (and any other code) i THEN want it to check if that var is true or false, then act accordingly. im having an issue where the if is true or false is firing before all my stuff is done.
[13:54:04] <Demonicpagan> can someone help me figure out why my jquery validation messages i have set aren't showing when i click my continue button? I just get the generic "This field is required message." http://jsfiddle.net/0o31wjro/
[13:58:50] <decx> your form doesnt have the form1 id Demonicpagan
[13:59:01] <P0rk> ugg. .live is deprecated...I didn't think it worked even back in 1.7...use .on (may not be the problem, though)
[13:59:22] <robertmaxrees> it was removed in 1.9
[13:59:25] <robertmaxrees> 1.7 it was deprecated
[13:59:36] <P0rk> are you a bot?
[13:59:39] <P0rk> lol
[13:59:44] <BillCriswell> beep boop.
[13:59:49] <P0rk> always glad you are around...
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/live/ tells you ;)
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> a lot of stuff was deprecatedin 1.7 and removed in 1.9
[14:05:41] <Demonicpagan> damn, add the form id and now my back button doesn't work with invalid form data
[14:09:44] <P0rk> Demonicpagan, are you using this as a learning tool or is this something important?
[14:09:56] <Demonicpagan> somethin important
[14:12:09] <Demonicpagan> thought that since i added cancel to the class for that input submit button that form validation would have been bypassed
[14:13:08] <P0rk> Who here has more tact than I do?
[14:13:45] <Demonicpagan> just dole it out P0rk, i can take it if it is towards me
[14:13:46] <P0rk> now that's funny...
[14:13:57] <s34n> can jquery-migrate be used with jquery 2.0+?
[14:14:26] <P0rk> It's certainly not personal, but there are a lot of problems that need to be solved before you should consider "adding cancel to the class"...
[14:14:46] <Demonicpagan> and those are?
[14:15:06] <P0rk> I'm afraid that you have gotten into the kind of thing that I do all the time...you have made it much more complicated than it needs to be...
[14:15:41] <robertmaxrees> and btw, you want to use .prop() and .removeProp() instead of the equivalent .attr() methods.
[14:15:57] <Demonicpagan> i'm working with prewritten code
[14:16:05] <robertmaxrees> just lettin' you know.
[14:16:18] <robertmaxrees> pain points and things that'll cause bugs and unexpected results.
[14:16:18] <P0rk> But this may be a good time to toss it and write the good stuff.
[14:17:23] <P0rk> If you outline what you are trying to accomplish, I bet a couple of guys in here could replace all that code with about 5 lines.
[14:18:13] <P0rk> It looks like you are trying to restrict input to validate inline...correct?
[14:18:35] <Demonicpagan> well, one thing at a time.. the cause of the breakage as to why i can't use the "back" button to go back when the form isn't valid
[14:19:06] <Demonicpagan> yeah that too
[14:19:20] <Demonicpagan> all lines are required except for address 2
[14:19:40] <P0rk> Can you use html5 at all?
[14:20:05] <Blaster> How come sometimes you see $('someElem').get(0)?
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> they want the raw dom node
[14:20:20] <Blaster> Oh okay.
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> instead of the jquery object.
[14:20:36] <Demonicpagan> some of this is coldfusion generated code output
[14:20:52] <robertmaxrees> Demonicpagan lol i work with coldfusion every day.
[14:20:55] <Demonicpagan> i just pulled from the source of the generated page
[14:20:59] <robertmaxrees> don't generate JS with CF.
[14:21:08] <Demonicpagan> i'm not generatign the js with cf
[14:21:08] <Blaster> Anyone know of a good line charting library?
[14:21:11] <Demonicpagan> just the html
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> and as terrble as CF is, you can output whatever you want with it.
[14:21:47] <Demonicpagan> the form is a cf loop
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really make a difference tbh.  you can generate whatever markup you want with it.
[14:23:48] <Demonicpagan> true
[14:23:52] <P0rk> can you use jquery bbq? It would capture the hashchange event to prevent or allow going back in history
[14:24:18] <Demonicpagan> i can include it, yes
[14:25:52] <Demonicpagan> lemme pick this up once i get home in a few minutes
[14:25:56] <P0rk> wait. what is blockUI
[14:26:05] <Demonicpagan> jquery block ui
[14:27:14] <robertmaxrees> oh that thing.
[14:27:32] <P0rk> that's what's causing your pages not to be able to go back...not validation
[14:38:19] <Demonicpagan> alright, i'm home
[14:40:06] <unnu> need a quick parse function to put http://www.example.com into <a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a> jquery have anything built in for that?
[14:40:50] <P0rk> ?
[14:42:03] <Demonicpagan> P0rk, other than asking what blockUI was before I had left, you have any other questions for what i'm trying to accomplish?
[14:42:49] <P0rk> $("a",{href:url,}).text(url)?  or something like that?
[14:44:22] <P0rk> Demonicpagan, I will comment on your fiddle so you can see what I am confused about. gimme a couple minutes
[14:44:30] <Demonicpagan> ok
[14:46:48] <ajquser> hi, i'm trying to access a function within my jquery/js... any help? http://jsbin.com/lojoqatebi/1/edit?js
[14:47:05] <ajquser> i'm trying to reload the getJSON every x seconds
[14:56:29] <P0rk> $(".validate").anymethod applies any jquery method to ALL of the items with class "validate" in them, so $(".validate").bind("submit", .....doesn't make sense to me.only the form fires the submit event (or the submit button), not every validating element, right?
[14:56:31] <P0rk> confusing
[14:57:45] <Demonicpagan> i'm still tryin to understand what was presented to me for the code
[15:02:51] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/vraz8tt3/1/
[15:03:18] <P0rk> that's the basic idea that I don't see in the code you have now....
[15:05:24] <Paradisee> how can i check if in my json there are objects in the "items" section? http://dpaste.com/1MSV7QG
[15:10:34] <shoky> Paradisee: http://jsfiddle.net/an6djdpx/
[15:10:59] <Paradisee> ty
[15:12:01] <ajquser> anyone able to help with my issue? http://jsbin.com/lojoqatebi/1/edit?js
[15:14:15] <shoky> ajquser: umm jd is the name of the argument, not the function that calls getJSON
[15:15:29] <ajquser> ok so how should I do the setTimeout ?
[15:16:11] <shoky> ajquser: http://jsbin.com/moxeduciye/1/edit
[15:16:27] <Paradisee> shoky: i have more categories
[15:16:35] <Paradisee> how can i iterate over them?
[15:16:42] <shoky> ajquser:  better to put the setTimeout inside the getJSON callback, actually..
[15:17:02] <P0rk> Demonicpagan, this is really really rough and just to get an idea of a different way to handle things: http://jsfiddle.net/vraz8tt3/2/
[15:17:07] <shoky> Paradisee: hm? donno what you mean.. but.. same way
[15:17:21] <P0rk> think of it as pseudo-code...lol
[15:19:23] <ajquser> shoky: still not sure what I need to change here - havent played with jquery much
[15:19:54] <shoky> ajquser: http://jsbin.com/moxeduciye/2/edit
[15:22:32] <Demonicpagan> P0rk, how is it that when i click the "continue" button i get no form errors?
[15:23:02] <P0rk> I didin't even look at your html...
[15:23:24] <P0rk> don't use inline calls in your html....onclick='bad'
[15:25:17] <P0rk> also, no two elements can have the same id
[15:25:48] <Demonicpagan> which 2 are presently showing the same id?
[15:26:05] <P0rk> id=visited
[15:26:21] <ajquser> thanks for that shoky
[15:26:25] <Demonicpagan> sounds like the radio buttons
[15:26:37] <P0rk> radio buttons have same name, different ids
[15:27:36] <P0rk> is the back button supposed to function like a reset or cancel button rather than a submit button
[15:27:52] <Demonicpagan> it is supposed to go back to the previous page
[15:27:54] <P0rk> type=submit means that when clicked it's gonna try to submit form
[15:28:06] <P0rk> which is why it wasn't working if the form didn't validate
[15:28:11] <ljdevs> Okay guys I need help, got a deadline for tonight and I'm not even close to finish it.
[15:28:34] <Demonicpagan> i was reading that if it had class="cancel" it was to skip validation
[15:28:43] <ljdevs> this mean just doesn't want to work for me. Using a offcanvas plugin called sidr
[15:28:45] <ljdevs> preview:
[15:28:54] <ljdevs> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54191672/theme/index.html
[15:29:03] <ljdevs> resize browser for mobile menu
[15:29:05] <ljdevs> then click menu
[15:29:08] <P0rk> classes are completely arbitrary...they don't have any magic for you....perhaps a plugin does that, but not native html
[15:29:23] <ljdevs> ill give money to anyone who can PM and personally help me :(
[15:29:35] <Demonicpagan> the jquery validation plugin
[15:29:44] <Demonicpagan> which is what i've been tryin to use
[15:30:14] <P0rk> it tells you to use a type=submit with class=cancel? Realy?
[15:30:50] <decx> ljdevs you have display: block !important in your .sidebar
[15:31:00] <decx> eh none
[15:31:02] <decx> display none
[15:31:26] <Demonicpagan> P0rk, read it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6748003/jquery-form-wizard-validation-how-to-skip-validation-on-a-back-button
[15:31:42] <ljdevs> nice find
[15:33:47] <P0rk> yuck
[15:34:09] <P0rk> cancelSubmit should prohibit the submit function, not prohibit the validate methods?
[15:35:16] <Demonicpagan> nothin in the jquery validation documentation that mentions anything on cancelSubmit
[15:35:53] <P0rk> springFlow is some sort of custom html markup pre-processor ?
[15:36:01] <P0rk> double yuck
[15:36:54] <Demonicpagan> To skip validation while still using a submit-button, add a class="cancel" to that input.
[15:37:37] <ljdevs> nice damn find, wtf
[15:37:46] <ljdevs> I'm feeling so stupid right now
[15:37:57] <P0rk> I'm not interested in trying to parse a backwards ass semantic nightmare like that. Maybe somebody else has the patience, but I don't.
[15:38:32] <P0rk> all so you can say type=submit on a button dedicated to not submitting? lol
[15:39:53] <Demonicpagan> i need a back button to allow the user to go back to the previous page and not be trying to validate the form
[15:43:43] <P0rk> so make a back button, <a href="#back' class='backbutton'>Back</a>
[15:44:18] <P0rk> or even <button id='backbutton'>back</button>  --terrible, but butter
[15:47:07] <ljdevs> How can I make it so the sidebar overlaps instead?
[15:47:12] <ljdevs> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54191672/theme/index.html
[15:48:34] <P0rk> or are you saying you want to submit the invalid form if they press back?
[15:49:01] <P0rk> maybe you want to store the data in a cookie so you can load it when they press fwd or something?
[15:53:32] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/vraz8tt3/8/
[15:54:00] <P0rk> roughly. Clicking on the back button adds the "noValidate" class to the form and submits the form anyways
[15:58:58] <Demonicpagan> yeah, the form isn't to be submitted if the back button is hit
[15:59:03] <ljdevs> How can I make it so the sidebar overlaps instead?
[15:59:05] <ljdevs> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54191672/theme/index.html
[15:59:11] <ljdevs> resize the screen for the header.
[15:59:31] <P0rk> than the back button certainly has no reason to be a submit button.
[15:59:45] <P0rk> just load the previous url.
[16:10:30] <ljdevs> decx, can you try to help?
[16:14:24] <vol4ko> why this dont fire the alert
[16:14:25] <vol4ko> http://jsfiddle.net/xbujsagL/
[16:16:46] <totesjakey> data-optname is not the same as data-opt-name
[16:18:25] <vol4ko> totesjakey, thanks for that i updated it but still the same
[16:18:25] <vol4ko> :/
[16:21:15] <totesjakey> Ive never had luck with .data()
[16:21:28] <totesjakey> try .attr('data-opt-name')
[16:22:38] <P0rk> try loggin $(this)
[16:23:45] <P0rk> $(this) is the select element, not the option
[16:25:19] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/xbujsagL/4/
[16:26:26] <P0rk> but you prolly want $(this).val()
[16:28:29] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/xbujsagL/6/  vol4ko?
[16:30:22] <vol4ko> I need value for another thing
[16:30:43] <vol4ko> Thank you P0rk i think i managed to get that event
[16:30:45] <P0rk> what other thing
[16:30:56] <vol4ko> to send to POST in formatted string
[16:31:17] <vol4ko> i am not sure if i can check that string with spaces with == and val()
[16:31:18] <P0rk> You can still use it
[16:31:23] <P0rk> yup
[16:31:42] <vol4ko> that will be the best, going to check it
[16:32:38] <vol4ko> it worked :)
[16:32:57] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/xbujsagL/7/
[16:33:23] <P0rk> setup your data("cost",50) like this,
[16:34:12] <P0rk> no need to select each one, and .attr() is not supposed to be used like that. use .data("cost",50) instead.
[16:34:47] <vol4ko> yeah, that reduces it a lot, i am new to jquery and thank you very much for this :) i will try to use .data
[16:35:09] <P0rk> np. Welcome to jquery.
[16:41:33] <Demonicpagan> $('input:text:visible:first').focus(); says what? the first visible text input?
[16:44:11] <P0rk> apply focus to the first visible text field, maybe?
[16:44:21] <Demonicpagan> ok
[16:44:25] <P0rk> don't know if you can stack pseudo-selectors like that
[16:44:47] <Demonicpagan> i found it in some code for another site
[17:05:46] <vol4ko> P0rk, i am doing something like this http://ideone.com/0GFq0m, can this work?
[17:06:45] <P0rk> says not found
[17:06:45] <systemfault> lol
[17:06:57] <P0rk> lol
[17:06:59] <systemfault> vol4ko: I love you even if you're trolling
[17:07:17] <systemfault> It's a damn good troll though.
[17:07:44] <systemfault> Compiling jQuery code using a java compiler. You sir, deserve a medal.
[17:08:25] <systemfault> vol4ko: Seriously, you want $('#additionalcpu_price').val($('#additionalcpu').data('cost')); no?
[17:08:28] <vol4ko> noooooooo, i haven't still found a place to paste my code
[17:08:51] <systemfault> vol4ko: jsfiddle.net is a good one
[17:08:55] <vol4ko> i wanted to set value element of #additionalcpu_price :)
[17:09:11] <vol4ko> thanks for the suggestion
[17:09:14] <systemfault> vol4ko: You want to use .val(theValue);
[17:09:24] <vol4ko> that worked
[17:09:32] <vol4ko> also .attr work
[17:09:51] <vol4ko> i am fairly new to jquery i am not sure what i am doing at this start
[17:10:52] <systemfault> vol4ko: It's a bit difficult to help without seeing the related HTML
[17:11:14] <systemfault> vol4ko: Which is why jsfiddle has 3 boxes (html/css/js)
[17:31:32] <bm505> Can anyone help me with this problem.  I have the following code in my script: <span class='time'>myObj.getData()</span>.  Is there a way to gain access to the 'myObj' using $('.time') somehow?
[17:35:26] <tw2113> bm505, as is, that's just text in a span
[17:36:25] <bm505> tw2113: right, that's the problem.  Are there any other options I can consider?
[17:36:44] <tw2113> your js should go in a js file or inside <script> blocks
[17:37:12] <tw2113> that way it gets interpretted as javascript and not just text
[17:37:28] <bm505> tw2113: I have all my js code within the <script> tags of my index.html
[17:37:46] <tw2113> except in that span tag above
[17:38:00] <bm505> tw2113: well that span tag is being generated by my script
[17:38:14] <tw2113> maybe it's better to ask what you're trying to do, or get a jsfiddle out of you for what you have so far
[17:40:23] <bm505> tw2113: So right now I have messages generated and output to my webpage at random times.  My goal is to update the timestamps of all the messages on the page everytime the script checks for new messages.
[17:41:58] <bm505> tw2113: the function being called within my span tag produces a human readable time difference between when the message was created and now.  for example: "3 sec ago"
[17:42:03] <tw2113> sounds like the $('.time') stuff could go inside getData()
[17:42:13] <tw2113> it'd select the right things and append/replace the data
[17:42:25] <tw2113> evening ryanneufeld
[17:42:36] <bm505> tw2113: ok let me think about that
[17:42:49] <tw2113> bm505, call the data function in your actual script tag area and use .html() to update the text
[17:42:54] <ryanneufeld> yess...?
[17:43:00] <tw2113> saying hi ryanneufeld
[17:43:04] <ryanneufeld> oh, hi

[17:50:00] <earational> hey
[18:00:35] <slavka`_> hey guys, just looking at this example >>> stackoverflow.com/questions/16660576/only-close-tooltip-if-mouse-is-not-over-target-or-tooltip can anyone explain to me why there is a need for >>> "....http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16660576/only-close-tooltip-if-mouse-is-not-over-target-or-tooltip...." ?
[18:01:30] <slavka`_> sorry what i mean is why there is a need for this line of code in the example above >>> if (typeof(event.originalEvent) === 'undefined')
[19:31:30] <bm505> Need help updating the html of all the elements with a class of '.time'.  My code as it is now says:  $('.time').each(function(index, element){element.html(my new html values);}  Unfortunately I get the error: "element.html() is not a function"  Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong?
[19:32:14] <systemfault> You want: $('.time').each(function() { var element = $(this); element.html('foo'); });
[19:32:47] <bm505> systemfault: oh
[19:32:47] <BillCriswell> If the new html value is the same for each element you can just do $('.time').html('foo');
[19:33:28] <bm505> BillCriswell: unfortunately, each one will be populated with values from another array
[19:34:38] <bm505> systemfault: can you help me understand what I need to set element to $(this).  I was under the impression, according to the jquery api, that the callback function has access to the element and the index
[19:34:47] <BillCriswell> bm505: If the array matches up with the index of the elements you can do $('.time').html(function(index){ return array[i]; });
[19:35:15] <systemfault> bm505: It's true but that element is a "pure" DOM node so you need to "jQuery-ify" it to access the jQuery functions
[19:35:37] <bm505> systemfault: I see, did not know that. thanks.
[19:35:59] <bm505> BillCriswell: Oh nice, let me try and see if that works as well
[20:21:54] <bm505> when i do something like: $('.someClassName'), I understand that I get a jQuery collection of objects that correspond to selector.  Does anyone know how I can determine the actual attributes of the items in the collection?
[20:31:22] <Mark_______> hello.
[20:31:35] <Mark_______> does anybody know why the hell jquery is not working in this webpage? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/board_lPQY33#
[20:31:43] <bm505> Is there a way to use JQuery to only select elements that are visible on the page?
[20:31:56] <Mark_______> if you do, please let me know, cause it’s been driving me crazy for almost a week.
[20:32:16] <Mark_______> bm505: i don’t know..
[20:32:45] <bm505> Mark_______: oh no, I was asking a question of my own lol
[20:33:08] <Mark_______> i know.
[20:33:16] <Mark_______> and i don’t know.
[20:33:17] <Mark_______> lol
[20:36:27] <bm505> figured it out.  if anyone is curious, the proper way would be like so:  $(selector).filter(':visible')
[20:36:55] <Mark_______> hedious
[20:37:43] <Mark_______> *hideous
[20:38:28] <doug64k> bm505: $(':visible') or $('div:visible') would be ok
[20:39:18] <doug64k> bm505: you probably meant .not(':hidden')
[21:23:52] <bm505> doug64k: thanks for the other options.  yes your way works too :)
[21:24:35] <bm505> doug64k: I was attempting to locate all the SPANS that had a particular class so that I could give them a different html value
[21:26:03] <bm505> doug64k: so what I ended up doing was $('.className').filter(':visible').html(function(){return (new html value)})
[21:26:17] <bm505> doug64k: seesm to work :)
[21:29:36] <jsnoob> Hey.. is this correct code:    (parseInt(t[1]) >= 24 || parseInt(t[3]) > 59 || 0 == parseInt(t[1]) && 0 == parseInt(t[3])) && (time.setHours(parseInt(0)), time.setMinutes(parseInt(1)), document.getElementById("time").value = "00:01")
[21:30:12] <jsnoob> How is comma being used after conditionals?
[21:31:25] <jsnoob> jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/x1ytn31h/
[21:35:44] <systemfault> It's shitty but correct
[21:36:04] <systemfault> when you have a list of statements separated by commas like that, the last value is returned.
[21:36:56] <jsnoob> systemfault:  Can you please show me a better way to write that.. http://jsfiddle.net/x1ytn31h/
[21:39:18] <jsnoob> systemfault: The code is full of statements seperated by commas.. And I was thinking of replacing them with semicolons... :(
[21:39:24] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/x1ytn31h/1/ ?
[21:41:22] <systemfault> A bit cleaner http://jsfiddle.net/x1ytn31h/2/
[21:43:45] <jsnoob> systemfault: oh..thank you so much. its clear now
