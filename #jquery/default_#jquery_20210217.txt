[10:12:17] <mulch2> what is the current standard for simulating a key press? i've spent an hour tying to simply trigger a datatables filter input... i can populate the box with a value, but i can't seem to do anything to actually trigger it.
[10:13:08] <mulch2> datatables binds to keyup, i believe
[13:31:07] <mulch2> robertmaxrees, do you know what could be preventing a keyup/keypress event from triggering on a datatables filter input?
[13:31:29] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno
[13:31:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm also not the only person in the channel lol
[13:31:52] <mulch2> you're the only person who's ever helped me lol
[13:32:02] <mulch2> and also seemingly the only one who ever responds
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel.  whoever can help, will.
[13:33:00] <mulch2> well, i already did when you were offline, but since i saw your name, i wanted to ask you, too
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:33:26] <robertmaxrees> anyway - not sure what would cause your issue.  datatables has a forum that might be more help?  without seeing an examile it's hard to say.
[13:33:31] <robertmaxrees> *example
[13:34:27] <mulch2> i've scoured their forums -- so much outdated info, hard to navigate :/
[13:34:43] <robertmaxrees> could also post your question there :)
[13:34:51] <robertmaxrees> not sure how active they are tho.
[14:01:51] <shoky> mulch2: you mean the standard datatables search input?  why not use table.search('foo') ?
[14:07:28] <mulch2> shoky, i'm experiencing some weird behavior when i try that... instead of giving me the same filtering i'd get by typing foo into the box, i get a fraction of the matches (like, 8 entries instead of 49), and datatables_info doesn't update to reflect them either.
[14:09:38] <mulch2> it's quite confusing with all their changes and weird naming conventions, i just thought it would be easier to just set the input value and use jquery to trigger the event, but that's been a disaster too... not sure if it's a binding thing or what.
[14:10:06] <shoky> faking keypresses was never something you could do reliably
[14:10:31] <mulch2> from what i can tell, the event triggering is working fine, but datatables isn't reacting to it
[14:10:45] <mulch2> ah :/
[14:10:56] <shoky> would need to see an example of the filtering behaviour, to try to help
[14:11:15] <shoky> not sure what datatables_info is
[14:11:41] <mulch2> the info div "showing x to x of xx entries"
[14:12:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like some confusion around how to filter in datatables.
[14:17:12] <shoky> mulch2: seems to be working fine for me
[14:20:26] <mulch2> probably just a personal issue i gotta figure out... sigh. was on such a creative roll and got owned by an input box
[14:22:07] <mulch2> thank you for checking for me, though -- btw, what version are you using?
[14:24:58] <shoky> mulch2: latest i think.  1.10.23   https://jsfiddle.net/79xz4bde/
[14:30:09] <mulch2> ty
