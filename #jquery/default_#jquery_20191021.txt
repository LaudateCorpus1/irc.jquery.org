[14:45:59] <MalMen> hi guys
[14:46:00] <MalMen> https://paste.ofcode.org/33hwJbkb8p82FCrzDjJqvcD
[14:46:23] <MalMen> how can I access the this.validationErrors from the outside function ?
[14:46:36] <robertmaxrees> wrong question :)
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> this is asynchronous.  anything that relies on this.validationErrors either needs to be within that .fail() (which should really be .catch() if you're on an even remotely up-to-date version of jquery), or you need to pass around the promise and use that instead
[14:49:09] <robertmaxrees> also: your 'this' inside that callback is different from the 'this' in the calling function.
[14:51:35] <MalMen> hmm
[14:51:47] <MalMen> the this I am trying to access is an variable from vuejs
[14:52:09] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:52:19] <robertmaxrees> doesn't vue have a way to handle fetching data?
[14:52:29] <robertmaxrees> ah, nvm.
[14:52:51] <robertmaxrees> and also: https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/data-fetching.html#fetching-after-navigation you'll notice they're using arrow functions in this example.
[14:53:01] <robertmaxrees> which "preserves" the 'this' in that callback.
[14:53:09] <MalMen> just made an workarround
[14:53:10] <MalMen> var here = this;
[14:53:15] <robertmaxrees> :(
[14:53:16] <MalMen> it worked as intented
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> don't do that
[14:53:24] <robertmaxrees> use an arrow function instead.
[14:54:57] <MalMen> yeah, you are right
[15:01:43] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with that weird indentation?
[15:03:52] <MalMen> robertmaxrees how would you do that arrow function ?
[15:04:03] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[15:04:45] <MalMen> [19:53:30] <robertmaxrees> use an arrow function instead.
[15:05:40] <robertmaxrees> right, so what do you mean?
[15:05:41] <MalMen> I am googling about that, and I did try this: var setError = function(errors) { this.validationErrors = errors } but didnt work
[15:05:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:05:53] <robertmaxrees> did you look at https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/data-fetching.html#fetching-after-navigation ?
[15:05:54] <MalMen> it looks like the this there is not the same
[15:06:09] <robertmaxrees> this uses an arrow function for that getPost example
[15:06:23] <MalMen> I am not using vuejs router
[15:06:28] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter
[15:06:40] <robertmaxrees> the example even says "// replace `getPost` with your data fetching util / API wrapper"
[15:07:00] <robertmaxrees> so .fail(function(error) { becomes .fail((error) => {
[15:07:04] <robertmaxrees> ezpz
[15:07:42] <MalMen> ok, I think I got it, thank you
[15:11:26] <MalMen> annnnnd, it worked :) thank you
[15:11:32] <robertmaxrees> sure
