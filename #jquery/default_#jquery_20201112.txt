[01:35:49] <audio> robertmaxrees: thanks that helped me
[01:36:12] <robertmaxrees> just a quick google search
[03:03:29] <errorous> Hello. I've weird issue. I need to wait until an element exist within an iframe
[03:04:09] <errorous> I first tried waiting for iframe to load, then do $('iframe').contents().find(), but for some reason that very div is not found
[03:04:11] <errorous> not sure why
[03:04:29] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe on the same port, protocal, and domain>
[03:04:31] <errorous> then, I tried the same thing, timeout unti that div exists, it's not found
[03:04:34] <robertmaxrees> *?
[03:04:39] <errorous> Robdgreat no no no
[03:04:45] <errorous> robertmaxrees
[03:04:51] <robertmaxrees> That's likely why.  CORS.
[03:04:59] <errorous> but it doesn't say anything
[03:05:05] <errorous> no error, no message, nothing
[03:05:12] <robertmaxrees> unless they're wide open, you don't have access.
[03:05:21] <errorous> I don't have access to dom?
[03:05:28] <robertmaxrees> not in an iframe offsite
[03:05:44] <errorous> iframe offsite, iframe loading from a different site?
[03:06:00] <robertmaxrees> from a different port, protocol, and/or domain
[03:06:06] <robertmaxrees> CORS
[03:06:26] <errorous> robertmaxrees so, what I'm trying to do is to prefill paypal form
[03:06:39] <robertmaxrees> can't do that afaik
[03:06:56] <robertmaxrees> i work for a fairly large ecom operation - can't do that.
[03:07:45] <errorous> so, how does it work. is paypal able to allow that? or, it will never be possible?
[03:08:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not a thing.
[03:08:38] <errorous> no, I meant,if paypal changed cors policy on their and, would it then be possible?
[03:08:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.  but paypal won't.
[03:09:04] <errorous> yeah, I know. just asking to better understand what's happening
[03:09:19] <robertmaxrees> go read up on CORS :)
[03:09:41] <errorous> I've way to much in backlog to read on :)
[03:09:51] <robertmaxrees> basically, unless a site explicitly allows it, cross-domain comms aren't a thing.
[03:10:31] <robertmaxrees> it protects end-users from visiting a site and having their emails/bank deets/etc stolen.
[03:10:49] <robertmaxrees> gross oversimplification of the subject, so go read about it.
[03:10:57] <robertmaxrees> foundational knowledge.
[03:18:32] <errorous> yeah, makes sense
[03:18:39] <errorous> thanks robertmaxrees
[03:19:21] <Cork> errorous: i'm quite sure paypal supports providing default email
[03:19:26] <Cork> but you can't set it your self
[03:19:40] <Cork> i know plenty of sites that prefill the email field with the email i use for the site
[03:19:48] <Cork> check your api hooks
[03:20:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[03:20:23] <Cork> (but if a third party could reach into an iframe and set the fields, they could also grab them and that would be a gigantic security hole
[03:20:39] <errorous> Cork so there's this paypal form on woocommerce that you can use to checkout with credit card via paypal. Now, that form is always blank. And since you need to provide personal info like name address etc on checkout form, to checkout via paypal, you would need to do the same thing twice
[03:21:04] <errorous> that's why I wanted to manipulate paypal form, to prefill user data that's already filled in different form
[03:21:18] <Cork> errorous: ya, can't do that ever, way to insecure
[03:21:32] <Cork> but check there api that you use to request a payment
[03:21:42] <Cork> i bet you you'll find fields to fill in things there
[03:21:52] <errorous> to what end?
[03:22:12] <Cork> errorous: what do you mean?
[03:22:15] <errorous> I can't, woocommerce's official plugin for paypal checkout
[03:22:22] <robertmaxrees> last i checked you can't do that.
[03:22:30] <robertmaxrees> but it's been a minute :)
[03:22:35] <errorous> hahaha
[03:22:37] <errorous> good one
[03:22:49] <robertmaxrees> hah unintentional
[03:23:10] <Cork> errorous: well i know paypal has some way to let the receptee set an email, never used paypal from the api side
[03:23:28] <errorous> Cork, so it's not about email. it's about credit card data
[03:23:49] <Cork> errorous: you souldn't have the creditcard data at all anyway
[03:23:53] <errorous> there's an option to pay with credit card, just like with stripe, but it goes through paypal
[03:23:53] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[03:24:03] <robertmaxrees> so you're taking CC info pre-paypal?
[03:24:18] <errorous> not credit card data, man, just billing info like first name last name email address
[03:24:36] <robertmaxrees> you should only take shipping info and let paypal take care of payment data.
[03:24:43] <errorous> robertmaxrees yes, there's another form( woocommerce ) that needs to be filled before paying
[03:25:02] <Cork> errorous: and the point is, you need to use there server side api, you won't ever EVER have client side script access to a security system
[03:25:05] <errorous> robertmaxrees, well, I didn't code woocommerce, now, did I? :)
[03:25:35] <robertmaxrees> never said you did homeslice.
[03:25:36] <Cork> and if you use a plugin that don't give you the access you need, then talk with them
[03:25:51] <Cork> js won't help you here
[03:26:04] <robertmaxrees> Cork last i checked you can't just pass that data even via api.
[03:26:31] <Cork> robertmaxrees: ya, if it is creditcard address information then no, not going to happen
[03:26:39] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^
[03:26:50] <robertmaxrees> my entire point.
[03:26:53] <Cork> again, as it is there to help prevent fraud
[03:27:01] <robertmaxrees> right :)
[03:27:20] <Cork> i know paypal has a "get the address of the payee" though
[03:27:27] <Cork> several sites i've used paypal with uses it
[03:27:40] <robertmaxrees> kindasorta.  it's a PITA tho.
[03:28:01] <Cork> ya, especially if you don't want to share the information with the site :/
[03:28:24] <Cork> (online buying digital goods, why shoyld they have my phone number...)
[03:28:30] <errorous> robertmaxrees you can safely use PITA in any context that mentions paypal
[03:28:31] <robertmaxrees> lots of users have that info saved with paypal/their browser tho.  saving grace.
[03:29:10] <Cork> robertmaxrees: sure they do, they are required to to be able to fill paypal with money...
[03:29:18] <Cork> so yay for privacy...
[03:29:48] <robertmaxrees> errorous i work for a company that does a massive amount in online sales - i currently work on our cart and checkout processes.  it's not the problem you think it is :)
[03:30:50] <errorous> perhaps, didn't really do all that much with paypal, or any other payment processors, for that matter. But my experience with paypal as a service in general is pita
[03:31:01] <robertmaxrees> bingo
[03:31:14] <Cork> most payment systems are a pita :)
[03:31:24] <robertmaxrees> for good reason tbh
[03:31:24] <Cork> it seams to be in there nature
[03:31:28] <Cork> true
[03:31:41] <Cork> but a few at least have good apis
[03:31:55] <robertmaxrees> just not paypal ;)
[03:31:57] <errorous> haha
[03:31:59] <Cork> s/good/sain/
[03:32:05] <Cork> and many many other
[03:32:05] <errorous> sain or sane?
[03:32:10] <Cork> sane
[03:32:14] * errorous looking up sain
[03:32:40] <errorous> to make the sign of the cross over so as to bless or protect from evil or sin
[03:32:45] <errorous> (archaic)
[03:32:51] <Cork> i've implemented payment with 5 different payment systems, and the longer they
[03:32:59] <Cork> *'ve been around the crasier they are
[03:33:11] <robertmaxrees> haha
[03:33:12] <errorous> and the future is not looking bright? :)
[03:33:30] <Cork> some has a nice api sending binary offset data; thats fun
[03:33:58] <robertmaxrees> we handle our own CC while also just handling straight payments.  therein does madness lies.
[03:34:03] <robertmaxrees> *lie
[03:34:04] <Cork> "line 45, byte 11-250 is the payees addres" -_-'
[03:34:09] <Cork> yay
[03:34:54] <Cork> not to start with when they send utf-8 over those systems >_<
[03:34:59] <robertmaxrees> haha
[03:36:14] <Cork> but the crasiest api i've seen, then on the subject has to be joker
[03:36:27] <Cork> they actually took http headers as a bases for there api...
[03:38:20] <robertmaxrees> anyway folks, heading to bed.  enjoy :)
[03:38:59] <Cork> robertmaxrees: good night!
