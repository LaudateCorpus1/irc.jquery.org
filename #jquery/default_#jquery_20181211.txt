[03:54:25] <Lars-Lasse> Hi, I think I found a bug in jQuery 3.3.1 described here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53707275/the-enabled-selector-in-microsoft-edge
[03:56:52] <Lars-Lasse> Don't know if it's even considered a bug
[03:58:15] <Woet> microsoft edge is a bug
[03:59:29] <Cork> lovely a question dumpe quitter...
[03:59:46] <Cork> and i'm actually suppriced not all browsers return link for :enabled
[03:59:52] <Cork> (as link has disabled)
[05:30:12] <Guest19709> $(".comment-"+val).replaceWith('<i class="fa fa-heart unlike" aria-hidden="true" id="like_"'val'"></i>');   What is the correct way escaping the val variable at the end?
[05:31:56] <Cork> $(".comment-"+val).replaceWith($('<i>', { class: 'fa fa-heart unlike', 'aria-hidden': 'true', id: 'like_' + val }))
[05:32:27] <Guest19709> Cork: you are the greatest :)
[05:33:19] <Cork> Guest19709:  that is also how you sould create elements in the other cases we looked at yesterday
[05:33:26] <Cork> as it prevents the problem of xss
[05:34:03] <Cork> (as what you put inside {} isn't ever evaled so can't be xss, except for the key html:, that you should also avoid)
[05:34:18] <Guest19709> Cork: yes, thank you for the reminder, will convert the rest of code to this.
[06:06:11] <Guest19709> Cork: I now stumbled upon another problem... After loading the comments with the likes, I now have a function which I use to like/unlike, triggered on click of like heart. But when I click it, nothing happens, not even an error:  https://jsfiddle.net/5psb3fme/   the function starts at #81, can you see anything obvious which might be causing it?
[06:08:12] <Guest19709> Its like the function do not find the newly inserted <i> classes
[06:09:45] <Guest19709> Put an alert in first line of beginning of function and it do not work, so it do not even recognise <i> class being clicked
[06:25:59] <Guest19709> Tried replacing  $("i.like, i.unlike").click(function() { with $("i.like, i.unlike").on('click', function() {  but still same
[06:28:06] <Guest19709> this worked   $(document).on('click','i.like, i.unlike', {} ,function(e){   :)
[07:23:09] <Cork> Guest19709: ya, delegate is waht you want, possibly not at document though
[07:23:18] <Cork> unless that is the closest static parent you have
[07:23:26] <Cork> (static shared parent)
[09:01:38] <Guest19709> Cork: thank you
[09:01:48] <Cork> np
[10:37:37] <Guest19709> Cork: sure delegate is necessary?  I read "The .on() syntax is the new syntax that version 1.7 uses and it is meant to substitute  .bind(), .delegate() and .live()."
[12:08:26] <meder_> what is $.templates used for? i couldn't find any reference to templating - only the $.tmpl / boris moore's plugin
[12:08:30] <meder_> 2.1
[12:09:13] <meder_> or what's probably likely is i'm assuming this was part of the core when it isn't because it got merged; most likely is the old plugin
[12:50:18] <Guest19709> $('#js-button').replaceWith($('<p>', {class: 'user-form-message', :html 'Check your inbox for instructions'}));     is :html correct? Cannot find any information on the valid attributes
[12:51:03] <robertmaxrees> err
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid object.
[12:51:46] <robertmaxrees> it's always {propertyOne: valueOne, propertyTwo: valueTwo} etc
[12:53:45] <Guest19709> robertmaxrees: are you sure? I used this without problem:  $(".comment-"+val).replaceWith($('<i>', { class: 'fa fa-heart unlike', 'aria-hidden': 'true', id: 'like_' + val }))
[12:54:35] <robertmaxrees> because that's a properly formatted object.
[12:54:45] <robertmaxrees> notice how the colons all come after property names?
[12:55:15] <robertmaxrees> your prior example has :html 'blah'
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> move the colon, see what happens.
[12:56:00] <Guest19709> robertmaxrees: oh I see now :) So else its correct?
[12:56:06] <robertmaxrees> might be?
[12:56:14] <robertmaxrees> though i'd use text there instead.
[12:56:25] <Guest19709> oki, tnx
[12:56:33] <robertmaxrees> also: if you doing a decent amount of templating, I'd pull in a templating engine instead of jquery for that.
[12:57:18] <Guest19709> robertmaxrees: oki, which one do you like? There are thousands it seems like
[12:58:15] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on your case and what you already have imported to your project :) if you've already got underscore, it has one built-in.  if you can get away with using ES6/babel transpilation, normal old template strings might be the way to go.
[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> Handlebars is a relatively popular choice.
[12:58:40] <Guest19709> tnx
[15:17:32] <igcewieling> I have the most simple html document in the world and I'm still getting refusing to load script errors (jquery-3.1.1) https://pastebin.com/zhx2Aegk    Any ideas on how to fix it.?
[15:18:15] <igcewieling> the pastbin contains the error as well as the html.
[15:18:38] <igcewieling> the actual script is at http://help.nyigc.net/bob.html if needed.
[15:18:42] <robertmaxrees> looks like your local server has CSP setup to block this.
[15:19:12] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: where would that be configured?  I'm using apache.   I ran certbot earlier, I assume that is what broke things.
[15:19:15] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/53690821/923919
[15:19:22] <robertmaxrees> for more info.
[15:19:57] <igcewieling> I'll dig through the thread on how to disable it in my server
[15:20:17] <igcewieling> I knew I should not have trusted certbot
[15:20:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> don't just disable certbot.
[15:20:41] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[15:20:44] <robertmaxrees> change its config.
[15:20:48] <robertmaxrees> it does good things.
[15:22:10] <igcewieling> I don't even know what it changed
[15:22:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:22:30] <robertmaxrees> you don't need that tho.
[15:22:39] <robertmaxrees> look into how to allow off-site scripts.
[15:23:08] <igcewieling> you mean add a meta tag to workaround a misconfigured web server?
[15:23:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not a misconfiguration.
[15:23:30] <robertmaxrees> CSP is a good thing.
[15:23:32] <robertmaxrees> you want that.
[15:23:38] <igcewieling> The script has worked for years without problems and today it does not.
[15:23:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:23:46] <igcewieling> I don't consider that acceptable.
[15:23:59] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what CSP does?
[15:24:36] <igcewieling> Why did the problem happen before today?
[15:24:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:24:50] <robertmaxrees> did or didn't?
[15:24:55] <igcewieling> correction: Why did the problem not happen before today?
[15:25:06] <robertmaxrees> because you enabled good security features on your server.
[15:25:09] <igcewieling> that is the problem I'm trying to figure out.
[15:25:24] <robertmaxrees> you turned on stuff that makes your site more secure.
[15:25:41] <igcewieling> No, I did not enable any security features on my server.   the only thing I can think of which might have is certbot.
[15:25:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:25:51] <robertmaxrees> okay duder.
[15:25:59] <igcewieling> and regardless *where is it configured*
[15:26:32] <robertmaxrees> you said you're using apache, right?
[15:26:53] <robertmaxrees> https://content-security-policy.com/#apache
[15:26:54] <robertmaxrees> if so.
[15:33:10] <igcewieling> Maybe apache was updated and the default changed.    grep -r "Content-Security-Policy" /etc/letsencrypt /etc/httpd /igc/switch_manager/html returns nothing
[15:33:24] <igcewieling> in any case thanks for trying.
[15:36:45] <robertmaxrees> can always try the rollback option
[15:36:58] <robertmaxrees> see if that works.
[15:45:26] <dionyc> hey guys looking for some help on checking if a property has inline style and then update property
[15:46:29] <robertmaxrees> dionyc mind if i ask why not use a class insteaD?
[15:47:37] <dionyc> @robertmaxrees i have a search container that changes display to inline when you scroll up
[15:47:55] <robertmaxrees> so
[15:48:00] <robertmaxrees> why not use a class? :)
[15:48:14] <dionyc> no in this use case when i toggle hamberger menu it has a big space between the header and mobile menu
[15:48:33] <dionyc> *so instead of no sorry
[15:49:00] <dionyc> so i want to check this property on.click and update the other container up
[15:49:01] <dionyc> http://jsfiddle.net/j5whv62r/
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting a class because it sounds like you want to make multiple changes to the styling at once.
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> you could even change styling "through" a parent element.
[15:49:34] <dionyc> i want to check if the property is inline if so then change property from this other class
[15:50:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not gonna be super easy.  you'd have to do some parsing.
[15:50:30] <robertmaxrees> using classes here would be much easier.
[15:50:48] <dionyc> @robertmaxrees i was afraid of that :(
[15:51:05] <robertmaxrees> what's the probnlem with classes?
[15:51:16] <robertmaxrees> a class will do literally everything you want and do it easier.
[15:52:52] <dionyc> i did not do the first part of mobile experience
[15:53:04] <dionyc> so i was trying to work with what i have, but may need to refactor
[15:54:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:54:33] <robertmaxrees> wouldn't take much here/
[15:54:41] <robertmaxrees> you just need to abstract out these changes into a css file.
[15:54:47] <robertmaxrees> and then addClass or removeClass
[15:55:12] <dionyc> @robertmaxrees check the code i was working with https://jsfiddle.net/tzyc6La8/
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> so a few questions.
[15:56:59] <robertmaxrees> 1. what does this change about my suggestion?  and 2. scroll handlers can be very nonperformant.  are you familiar with how you prevent htose issues?
[16:00:25] <dionyc> 1. It's not supposed to change anything, I want to check when "search-button-mobile-scroll" is inline to change the top: property value to something less. 2. I did not right this but i am fighting so we dont this. I am not familiar with this altogether.
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> oof.
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> so back up - do you just want the current computed value for the css property, or do you need to know if it's via the style tag??
[16:02:13] <dionyc> so now when this search but is on the top bar and click the menu it looks crazzzy
[16:03:06] <dionyc> so now i want to check the property value of the search class, if this is true and i look for this other class to change the property value of top
[16:03:44] <dionyc> so the first jfiddle was an attempt to do this on http://jsfiddle.net/j5whv62r/
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> that's different from your original question fwiw :)
[16:03:49] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/css/ can do that.
[16:04:04] <dionyc> i was not sure if my if statement was correct
[16:05:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:06:06] <dionyc> on this http://jsfiddle.net/j5whv62r/ not sure if im doing it right
[16:06:51] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:07:04] <robertmaxrees> what is searchMobile supposed to be?
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> it's not defined in there at all.
[16:07:49] <robertmaxrees> do you mean $searchMobile there?  if so, that doesn't make sense either, since you're already doing $(".search-button-mobile-scroll").css("display", "inline"), which will set display: inline on that element./
[16:07:56] <robertmaxrees> so checking is redundant.
[16:08:24] <mdobrian> first timer here with a question...in 1.9.1 my data tables were solid black but in 3.2.1 they are now gray with row separators even though I've confirmed the .png specified for the background is black.  Anyone know how to override the gray formatting?
[16:08:47] <robertmaxrees> mdobrian not sure what exactly you're referring to.
[16:08:55] <robertmaxrees> datatables and jquery?  something else?
[16:09:08] <mdobrian> jquery data tables
[16:09:28] <robertmaxrees> talking about https://datatables.net/ ?
[16:10:28] <mdobrian> I don't know, is that separate from jquery 3.2?  my co-worker (who's no longer here) upgraded us
[16:10:52] <robertmaxrees> datatables is completely separate from jquery
[16:11:54] <mdobrian> as far as I know, this is just jquery 3.2 data tables
[16:12:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not a thing heh
[16:12:16] <robertmaxrees> hence my confusion.
[16:12:23] <mdobrian> lol, then I have no idea
[16:13:03] <mdobrian> the theme is called "ui-darkness" is that in datatables.net?
[16:13:25] <robertmaxrees> that's likely from jquery ui.
[16:13:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like make jquery, jqui, and datatables all mixed together?
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you're looking at?
[16:15:18] <mdobrian> it's an internal ui so I can't provide a link
[16:16:31] <robertmaxrees> funky.
[16:16:32] <mdobrian> here's the line of code that is specifying the black .png in jquery-ui.css... background: #000000 url("images/ui-bg_inset-soft_25_000000_1x100.png") 50% bottom repeat-x;
[16:17:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's jquery ui
[16:18:12] <mdobrian> am I in the correct channel?
[16:18:25] <robertmaxrees> not sure!  you're talking about "
[16:18:43] <robertmaxrees> *about a "data table" which is generally in reference to the datatables library.
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery and jquery ui don't really have a "data table" functionlaity built in.
[16:28:36] <mdobrian> ok, it looks like jQuery UI - v1.12.1 & DataTables 1.10.16 ?
[16:28:50] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[16:34:40] <mdobrian> I guess my question is in DataTables 1.10.16 why is my black background showing as gray?
[16:38:45] <robertmaxrees> you said something was updated recently, yeah?  any idea what it was?
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> because a change in jqui might be the culprit.
[16:39:36] <mdobrian> it looks like we were using datatables 1.9.4 which showed a solid black background with no row separators
[16:40:21] <mdobrian> I'm trying to get back to that style in 1.10.16
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> i might check out https://datatables.net/manual/styling/jqueryui and https://datatables.net/manual/tech-notes/13
[16:42:27] <mdobrian> ok, I'll try those, thanks!
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> if you have more questions I might hit up the datatables forums.
