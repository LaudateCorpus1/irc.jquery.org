[00:00:45] <doug64k> phoenixz: you could wipe the rules from the other one using the rules method, then it will just pass validation
[00:00:46] <phoenixz> doug64k: eehh, I don't have that problem at all... Say I have a form with 2 select boxes and a submit button.. IF the submit button is pressed, validation needs to occur, but if I change select box 1, the form will be submitted through an onchange event, and reload with different information for select box two... If the form submit originated from a change in select box one, NO validation should be done.. So I just want to know, where is this
[00:00:46] <phoenixz> select coming from? the submit button? ok, validate.. Anything else? don't validate
[00:01:12] <doug64k> ok
[00:02:44] <doug64k> phoenixz: you want a "force submit". just use the .rules method in the validator plugin to wipe the rules and submit. it will blindly pass validation
[00:03:41] <phoenixz> doug64k: well yeah, but the problem is when... I mean, there is no "pre validate" like event handler I can use...
[00:03:49] <doug64k> phoenixz: function forceSubmit(form) { $(form).rules('remove'); $(form).submit(); }
[00:04:11] <doug64k> oops
[00:04:14] <doug64k> form.submit()
[00:04:16] <phoenixz> doug64k: yeah, I gathered that much but.. that one needs to be executed before the validator starts
[00:04:54] <doug64k> phoenixz: let's back up for one moment - you are going through all this reload and reinitialize for what? you cannot use ajax?
[00:05:13] <doug64k> phoenixz: ajax would make this easy and not keep reloading
[00:05:37] <phoenixz> I'll add ajax support on it as well and yeah, that will skip the submit and this problem, but I also need it work without ajax
[00:06:56] <phoenixz> doug64k: So all I need to know is, I need a function to be executed at the onsubmit that is executed before the validator, that can check where the submit comes from, and if it does not come from the submit button, then it will kick the validator rules and continue submitting
[00:08:27] <doug64k> phoenixz: then dont add any rules until the moment they click submit button, then call the validate method it provides, and if valid, call submit on the form, else remove the rules and do nothing
[00:08:56] <doug64k> phoenixz: however, it isnt that easy - if they press enter it will fire a submit. those will be allowed with that algorithm
[00:09:15] <phoenixz> ugh.. if only there was a prevalidate event..
[00:12:29] <doug64k> phoenixz: I looked more. I can't see a way of doing that
[00:12:54] <doug64k> it should provide a hook that asks you if you want to validate
[00:13:03] <phoenixz> doug64k: exactly
[00:13:08] <phoenixz> doug64k: but..
[00:13:32] <phoenixz> Is it possible to add two handlers for an event, that should not be a problem, right? and, would they be executed in order of me adding them?
[00:13:40] <doug64k> yes
[00:13:43] <doug64k> no problem
[00:13:43] <phoenixz> that way, I could add an event handler to the form onsubmit before the validator
[00:13:59] <phoenixz> and then that would run before the validatpor, do the check, and clear the rules if necesary
[00:14:16] <doug64k> that should work
[00:14:36] <doug64k> jquery internally manages those arrays of events so it definitely will be in order of .on calls
[00:14:55] <doug64k> arrays of callbacks I mean
[00:15:07] <doug64k> it won't let it call addEventListener more than once for a given element
[00:15:15] <Cork> doug64k: no it doesn't actually
[00:15:25] <doug64k> since when
[00:15:29] <Cork> but it uses addEventListenr
[00:15:35] <Cork> and it supports more then one handler
[00:15:48] <Cork> doug64k: the list it keeps isn't for triggering
[00:15:51] <doug64k> that isn't what I said
[00:15:52] <Cork> it is for managing the handler
[00:15:53] <Cork> +s
[00:16:11] <Cork> like ex for .off()
[00:16:31] <doug64k> I said, instead of calling addEventListener repeatedly for a given element, it only lets it happen once, and jquery manages the array of callbacks to make when that event fires
[00:16:49] <Cork> doug64k: ya, and that isn't correct
[00:16:51] <doug64k> so the order of callbacks wont depend on the browsers implementation
[00:16:57] <Cork> it adds one event listener for each handler
[00:17:18] <Cork> unless you use delegated event handlers that is
[00:17:32] <doug64k> you say that quite matter-of-factly
[00:17:55] <Cork> i've read through the code that adds the handlers enough times to be quite sure ya
[00:20:19] <djam90> If I use the jQuery UI Selectable Widget, is it possible to only have one item selectable at any time (like radio buttons), and also to be able to submit these as part of a form?
[00:22:05] <doug64k> Cork: then why does my browser say there is one event listener http://www.jstraight.com/1174/2
[00:24:05] <doug64k> let me manually addEventListener to verify there are two there

[01:05:32] <sunny_> how to implement the event or action listener in jquery drag and drop
[01:56:19] <abailarri> Hello. I'm creating a webapp that have a instant messagery section. When an user is connected, I see that its connected because I have a div that is green when status connection is 1 on is grey (not connected) when status connection is 0. This values (1 or 0) are retrived from the database and changes when the user logins or logouts. But when the user closes the browser, it not changes. What ways exists to know if th user closes th
[01:56:19] <abailarri> e browser (or the tab) and make an ajax call to change the status connection?
[01:59:25] <BryanRuiz> sooo yeah
[01:59:46] <BryanRuiz> im doing syncronous ajax in a function
[01:59:59] <BryanRuiz> before that function loads im trying to load a jQuery.loader()
[02:00:09] <BryanRuiz> but it doesnt happen in the right order
[02:00:12] <usrb1n> Hello :) What am I doing wrong ? $('table:first-child > span:last').remove();
[02:00:16] <BryanRuiz> any idea why?
[02:00:29] <usrb1n> (I'm so impressed about how easy is to work with elements in jquery)
[02:00:36] <Cork> BryanRuiz: don't ever; ever use sync ajax
[02:01:02] <Cork> usrb1n: what is it you're trying to do?
[02:01:34] <Cork> usrb1n: you need to provide the context
[02:02:27] <usrb1n_> I have 3 tables in the page, not identified by any unique IDs or classes. I want to get the first-child table and delete the last span
[02:02:34] <usrb1n_> Sorry, I have crashed, not sure who asked me :)
[02:03:03] <usrb1n_> If I do this: $('table:first-child').remove();  it removes the correct table. Now I want, from that table to remove only the last <span> element
[02:03:07] <Cork> usrb1n_: note that table:first-child means "the first child if it is a table"
[02:03:13] <Cork> not first child that is a table
[02:03:18] <usrb1n_> oh
[02:03:44] <usrb1n_> Should I use eq ?
[02:04:11] <Cork> also a span can't ever be a direct child of a talbe
[02:04:14] <Cork> *table
[02:04:40] <Cork> so i suspect you want $('table:first-child span:last').remove();
[02:05:11] <Cork> alternatively
[02:05:23] <Cork> $('table:first-child > tbody > tr > td> span:last').remove();
[02:06:04] <Cork> usrb1n_: that said, don't be afraid of classes, use the freely
[02:06:14] <Cork> it speeds up and simplifies selectors
[02:07:44] <SexualRickshaw> Okay, stupid jQuery question: when using $('class-name').css, can it not affect a specific state of an element (such as a:hover)?
[02:08:16] <Cork> SexualRickshaw: .css updates the style property of the element
[02:08:22] <Cork> it doesn't update css rules
[02:08:34] <Cork> so yes you can't target selectors
[02:08:48] <SexualRickshaw> So I would need to add that css rule via a different method?
[02:09:12] <Cork> i suggest adding a class and using the :hover in the css if that class is applied
[02:09:21] <SexualRickshaw> Okay, thanks
[02:21:53] <SexualRickshaw> It must be the fact that I'm incredibly tired right now, but I'm having a hard time thinking that through
[02:22:19] <Cork> thinking what through?
[02:22:28] <mooncup> hm when I'm using datepicker.show() do I have to use the same selector that created the datepicker or can I just select the input its attached to in another way?
[02:23:06] <Cork> mooncup: you need to target the same element
[02:23:11] <Cork> doens't have to be the same selector
[02:23:21] <SexualRickshaw> Well, the thing is is that to get to the selector, I have to use a nested CSS rule
[02:23:26] <mooncup> thats what I figured
[02:23:30] <mooncup> must be something else breaking
[02:23:31] <mooncup> thanks
[02:24:05] <Cork> SexualRickshaw: nested rule?
[02:24:50] <SexualRickshaw> Like nav > li > a:hover
[02:25:05] <Cork> that isn't nested
[02:25:17] <SexualRickshaw> Other people would call that nested, for some reason
[02:25:37] <Cork> its just a relation selectior
[02:25:41] <Cork> nothing nested in it
[02:26:13] <Cork> a nested selector would be a selector inside another selector
[02:26:25] <SexualRickshaw> Which I've seen in LESS and SASS
[02:26:27] <Cork> and native css doesn't support that (sasl do though)
[02:26:36] <Cork> ya
[02:26:46] <Cork> but they compile the css before it is submitted though
[02:27:24] <SexualRickshaw> So I would check to see if a class is applied to an id/element, and if it isn't, I'd apply the class?
[02:27:34] <Cork> no
[02:27:38] <jeroenem> how can i toggle a class on my body when a specific section is active using FullPage.js - https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js
[02:27:43] <Cork> just do addClass('should-have-hover')
[02:27:53] <Cork> and in the css do .should-have-hover:hover {}
[02:28:08] <Cork> addClass will check if it exist or not
[02:28:18] <Cork> and only add it if it isn't there yet
[02:31:09] <SexualRickshaw> Would I do it to the parent element? Because trying to apply it to anything but the relation selectors doesn't do anything
[02:32:03] <Cork> SexualRickshaw: you might have to use an and selector in the original styling
[02:32:11] <Cork> to override the :hover you don't want
[02:32:31] <Cork> you might be able to use :not() but you can't use anything by the simplest selectors in it
[02:32:34] <Cork> (no relation)
[02:32:43] <Cork> *anything but
[02:34:09] <SexualRickshaw> This is only happening because I want a specific hover for resolutions higher than tablet size
[02:35:02] <Cork> SexualRickshaw: just use the @media query
[02:35:10] <Cork> if you want it based on the resolution
[02:35:22] <SexualRickshaw> Well, I'm using Bootstrap, much to my... chargin
[02:35:24] <Oka> Holy XY problems, batman.
[02:35:40] <Cork> ya
[02:38:20] <SexualRickshaw> Diving into Bootstrap's minified CSS is just a pain
[02:38:56] <sacho> so use their non-minified css
[02:42:53] <SexualRickshaw> Editing the straight CSS didn't work, great
[02:45:16] <deranged_user> does .ready fire before css files are loaded? it seems like that is happening for me.
[02:46:26] <deranged_user> that is, $(document).ready#
[02:46:31] <deranged_user> -#
[02:48:04] <Erwat> hey is it possible to have a confirmation pop up when the user presses the back button?
[02:48:04] <SexualRickshaw> Well, even though I didn't have to use jQuery to fix it, thanks for the help Cork
[02:48:28] <Erwat> wait, window.onbeforeunload
[02:48:30] <Erwat> i forgot about that
[03:05:25] <Cork> Erwat: note onbeforeunload isn't supported in all browsers
[03:05:51] <Erwat> it isn't?
[03:05:54] <Erwat> damn
[03:06:20] <Cork> Erwat: it is heavily abused so some of the one supporting it is talking about removing it
[03:06:28] <Cork> and opera haven't ever supported it
[03:06:36] <Cork> (for the same reason)
[03:06:48] <Cork> Erwat: so if "most of the time" is good enough
[03:06:52] <Cork> you can use it
[03:06:58] <Erwat> we were discussing whether we should have a confirmation dialog
[03:07:00] <Cork> if it has to catch every time, then no it isn't
[03:07:07] <Erwat> if somebody clicks the "Go back to lobby" button in our game
[03:07:18] <Erwat> honestly, i think the confirmation should be there 100%
[03:07:31] <Erwat> it's a game, if you go back to the lobby you lose progress or fail to see certain things
[03:07:33] <Cork> Erwat: so bind a click handler on the button
[03:07:44] <Cork> and have it prevent the click if not confirmed
[03:07:48] <Erwat> yeah, but other guys don't want it
[03:07:54] <Erwat> "oh if he pressed the button he intends to go there"
[03:07:56] <Erwat> or some shit like that
[03:08:03] <Cork> so have a setting for it
[03:08:03] <Erwat> imo it's a bad user experience
[03:08:25] <Erwat> i've literally never been annoyed by a confirmation dialog on exit
[03:08:34] <Cork> i have
[03:08:36] <Erwat> but i've been annoyed by no confirmation dialog existing
[03:08:48] <Erwat> i've lost quite a bit of progress over a game and the worst part is
[03:08:53] <Erwat> "ITS ONLY GAME. Y U HEFF TO BE MAD"
[03:09:05] <Cork> well i can see a point for it in a game
[03:09:13] <Cork> but some use it as soon as you try to leave there site
[03:09:16] <Erwat> Cork: the problem with the button is that the back and device back button would still not confirm
[03:09:18] <Cork> and try to loop the question
[03:09:20] <Erwat> onbeforeunload does though
[03:09:26] <Erwat> yeah i get that
[03:09:28] <Cork> that is a compleately different situation though
[03:09:40] <Erwat> i actually thought that the confirm dialog was done for that stuff to prevent it
[03:10:00] <Erwat> the "disable notifications from this site" button on them
[03:10:10] <Cork> sure
[03:10:13] <Erwat> if you get too many alerts
[03:10:15] <Cork> but it is still abused
[03:10:23] <Erwat> yeah, i understand
[03:10:35] <Cork> i totally see your point and agree
[03:10:43] <Cork> i just want to warn you that it isn't 100%
[03:10:56] <Erwat> somebody bruoght up a more nefarious reason for having such a confirmation dialog though: this means they're less likely to go to another game and we would make morem oney!
[03:11:14] <Erwat> when i heard that i gave up and agreed to not having a confirmation at all
[03:11:22] <Cork> that is the driving factor behind the reason i gave you before
[03:11:25] <Erwat> that's just the wrong reason to do it
[03:11:33] <Cork> ya
[03:11:36] <Erwat> anyways yeah, thanks for the info. i had no idea this wasn't supported on some browsers
[03:12:02] <Cork> Erwat: one thing you could look into that they argue is the solution one should use instead (if beforeunload is dropped)
[03:12:22] <Cork> is to store the state of the page, and on reverting back to the page resume where you where
[03:12:39] <Cork> that is easier said then done in a client side (game) though
[03:12:50] <Cork> just giving some backstory :)
[03:12:55] <Erwat> yeah, that is one of the reasons why i thought it was a big deal for people leaving
[03:13:13] <Cork> ya, it most likely is
[03:13:19] <Erwat> i've had to work on another game where this was wanted "to resume an interrupted game"
[03:13:30] <Erwat> but it is a really difficult problem to tackle
[03:13:38] <Cork> ya
[03:13:53] <Cork> it is definitely doable, but far from easy

[04:33:48] <sprihodko> Hi. I have lot(> 100) of divs on page with text content in it. Now i add simple filtering with this code http://pastie.org/9734328 . Is it possible to paginate divs and filtering still works for all, not only on visible?

[05:11:23] <Expel> How do I change the fancybox outer opacity to be more colorful not that much opacity as it has by default
[05:20:18] <dieguezz> hi, how can i debug why the values of console log are correct in the fiddle but incorrect on my envirornment? http://jsfiddle.net/s8s3f9c7/6/
[05:21:34] <Cork> dieguezz: what "value"
[05:24:46] <K4T> Question about design. What should I do in line 15. when error appear? Even I know that console.log is a horrible solution. Here is code: http://pastebin.com/dMzpkDNg. Should I create new event like "tracksLoadingError"?
[05:25:46] <dieguezz> Cork,  the one in console.log offsetPlus
[05:26:54] <Cork> dieguezz: $('section[id="' + id + '"]') => $('#' + id)
[05:26:58] <dieguezz> on my envirornment should be 680, 494, 571, etc.. instead is returning: 680, 275, 174, etc (notice that the first is correct)
[05:27:30] <Cork> hmm
[05:27:39] <Cork> can't find the console.log you're talking about
[05:27:53] <dieguezz> line 23
[05:28:15] <Cork> uh it's console.log select not offsetPlus
[05:28:45] <jeffreylevesque> my click event isn't sending anything to my php script - http://jsfiddle.net/r4mcsvx0/
[05:28:59] <jeffreylevesque> did i do the $.post incorrectly?
[05:29:13] <dieguezz> oh, sorry Cork  i was talking about the response of console.log
[05:29:16] <dieguezz> :D
[05:29:42] <Cork> dieguezz: add a console.log in the loop before and check that the values in there are what you expect
[05:30:22] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: what is '.reader_start' ?
[05:30:52] <jeffreylevesque> it's an input element of type button
[05:31:05] <Cork> is this element inside a form?
[05:31:09] <jeffreylevesque> yes sir
[05:31:43] <Cork> you should prob use <button type="button"></button> instead
[05:32:04] <Cork> as it isn't meant to be a submit button (but that is what you have)
[05:32:52] <Cork> so the form is submitting and kills the ajax call
[05:33:04] <jeffreylevesque> thank you, i will try it!
[05:33:17] <dieguezz> cork maybe can be because on the fiddle i set the height with css
[05:33:27] <dieguezz> and on my page the height is given by elements inside each selector?
[05:33:29] <Cork> dieguezz: very possible
[05:33:34] <dieguezz> http://prod-bitbloq.com.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
[05:33:42] <dieguezz> how could i solve that?
[05:34:04] <Cork> hard to say without seeing the actual problem
[05:34:13] <Cork> it could be one of several reasons
[05:34:24] <Cork> the content might not have been added yet
[05:34:29] <Cork> so it has the wrong height
[05:35:03] <Cork> dieguezz: btw why are you double looping the sections?
[05:35:21] <Cork> the second forEach is eally unneeded
[05:35:35] <jeffreylevesque> does a button tag require a closing tag in HTML5?
[05:35:53] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: <button>content</button>
[05:35:56] <Cork> it doens't have a value=""
[05:36:12] <jeffreylevesque> thank you
[05:37:55] <anli> What is $.prompt?
[05:38:00] <Cork> dieguezz: http://jsfiddle.net/s8s3f9c7/7/
[05:38:06] <Cork> anli: something none standard
[05:38:11] <Cork> check your list of plugins
[05:38:16] <anli> ok
[05:38:28] <anli> Maybe I was writing it myself ;)
[05:38:42] <anli> I did...
[05:39:00] <anli> I would be impressed if you knew about it
[05:39:39] <jeffreylevesque> darn, the ajax $.post still doesn't execute
[05:40:10] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: try reproducing the problem in jsfiddle
[05:40:37] <jeffreylevesque> i added console.log() under the on('click',
[05:40:47] <jeffreylevesque> but, that doesn't even fire
[05:41:21] <Cork> so your selector doesn't find the elements
[05:41:32] <Cork> are you use the elements exist when the selectors run?
[05:44:34] <jeffreylevesque> yeah, the elements are created on html (not dynamically)
[05:45:03] <Oka> jeffreylevesque: add your form to the testcase
[05:46:41] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/r4mcsvx0/1/
[05:47:49] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: you have invalid js on line 20
[05:48:02] <Oka> was just about to say lol...
[05:48:09] <Cork> SON.stringify(data, undefined, 2) : 'non$ => SON.stringify(data, undefined, 2) : 'non$';
[05:48:53] <jeffreylevesque> sorry, terminal didnt let me copy the entire line
[05:48:57] <jeffreylevesque> i've updated it
[05:48:58] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/jeff1evesque/r4mcsvx0/2/
[05:51:27] <Cork> uhh
[05:51:36] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: - != _ :)
[05:51:59] <Cork> class="reader-start"  $('.reader_start')
[05:52:11] <CapnKlutch> Please help me, The done function is firing but the class is not getting added, can someone help please? - http://pastebin.com/BKKhBJrq
[05:52:13] <Oka> aha
[05:52:55] <jeffreylevesque> haha
[05:52:55] <Cork> CapnKlutch: does the previous sibling have the class?
[05:53:03] <CapnKlutch> yes it does
[05:53:14] <Cork> and there is no other siblings inbetween?
[05:53:26] <jeffreylevesque> Cork thank you!
[05:53:27] <CapnKlutch> I even tried it without the prev() and it didn't work
[05:53:38] <Cork> ah, ...
[05:53:49] <Cork> sigh, why didn't i take this straight off...
[05:53:58] <Cork> CapnKlutch: function() {} creates a new scope
[05:54:07] <Cork> and in each function scope you get a new this
[05:54:12] <CapnKlutch> So how do I do it?
[05:54:20] <Cork> so this outside the ajax callback isn't the same as the one inside
[05:54:32] <Cork> either store the outer this in a variable so you can reach it
[05:54:34] <CapnKlutch> Is there a  way to access this?
[05:54:37] <Cork> or set context: in the ajax call
[05:54:44] <Cork> ^
[05:55:08] <CapnKlutch> like this? - .done(function(this = this) {
[05:55:12] <Cork> no
[05:55:18] <Cork> set context: in the ajax call <--
[05:55:31] <jeffreylevesque> i moved the console.log inside the .done() method.  nothing gets printed in the console
[05:55:48] <jeffreylevesque> my $.post() doesn't run
[05:55:55] <Cork> $.ajax needs to get a different value to use for this if you don't want what it uses by default
[05:56:18] <jeffreylevesque> i can't use $.post?
[05:56:25] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: and neither does the .fail callback?
[05:56:32] <jeffreylevesque> didn't check that
[05:56:48] <jeffreylevesque> oh, actually, there is an error console.log
[05:56:56] <jeffreylevesque> but that doesn't get printed in the console windwo
[05:57:12] <CapnKlutch> Cork, how do I set the context
[05:57:25] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com ajax
[05:57:31] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[05:57:48] <CapnKlutch> context: document.body
[05:57:54] <CapnKlutch> Ah Now I see
[05:58:02] <jeffreylevesque> ah, i didn't want to use $.ajax, because I didn't want this to be form based
[05:58:10] <jeffreylevesque> so i thought i could use $.post
[05:58:10] <Cork> uh... no
[05:58:15] <Cork> not document.body!!
[05:58:15] <CapnKlutch> No?
[05:58:20] <Cork> context: this
[05:58:33] <CapnKlutch> Ok fixed it
[05:58:47] <mooncup> what's the best way to upload a file via ajax?
[05:59:10] <Cork> CapnKlutch: $.get $().load $.getJSON $.post is all just shorthands for $.ajax
[05:59:20] <Cork> they all run $.ajax on the backend
[05:59:36] <jeffreylevesque> can i fix my $.post, or should i used $.ajax?
[05:59:40] <CapnKlutch> Cork, thanks for the help
[05:59:42] <mooncup> I've found this http://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax
[05:59:56] <Cork> (honestly i think they all except .load should just be dropped)
[05:59:58] <mooncup> however I don't know if it's any good as I have no idea where to statrt
[06:00:20] <Cork> mooncup: you would have to use dataForm
[06:00:23] <Cork> ?mdn dataForm
[06:00:30] <b-ot> Cork: Data form validation - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation
[06:00:34] <Cork> uh... no
[06:00:39] <Cork> ?mdn formData
[06:00:41] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[06:00:42] <Cork> -_-'
[06:01:11] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: the $.ajax comment was for CapnKlutch
[06:01:18] <Jac0bz1> Anyone that could help me? I have this JSON response, and i want to send that to a <textarea> but the new lines (\n) dont come out as acctual new lines... http://pastebin.com/sQULApdj
[06:01:19] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: $.post should work for your case
[06:01:59] <Cork> Jac0bz1: how do you add the value to the textarea?
[06:01:59] <jeffreylevesque> i changed the url to some non-existing url, and it gave me an error
[06:02:10] <jeffreylevesque> so basically, the done, and fail methods don't work
[06:02:24] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: $.ajax isn't allowed to go cross domain, if that is what you're hitting
[06:02:42] <jeffreylevesque> well i did starter = $.post()
[06:02:51] <Cork> should work fine
[06:02:52] <jeffreylevesque> then i did starter.done() { }
[06:03:01] <Cork> uh
[06:03:02] <jeffreylevesque> and, starter.fail() {}
[06:03:02] <Cork> no
[06:03:06] <jeffreylevesque> but neither of those work
[06:03:06] <Cork> no no
[06:03:18] <Cork> starter.fail(function() {})
[06:03:27] <Cork> not fail() {}
[06:03:32] <jeffreylevesque> aha
[06:04:03] <Cork> and you do the correct thing in the fiddle
[06:04:12] <jeffreylevesque> yea, whoops
[06:04:15] <jeffreylevesque> i did it correctly
[06:04:28] <jeffreylevesque> not sure why those two methods don't run
[06:04:39] <jeffreylevesque> oh, i may have an idea
[06:04:55] <jeffreylevesque> my ajax opens a port thing
[06:05:03] <jeffreylevesque> and it's like an infinite loop kind of thing
[06:05:07] <jeffreylevesque> that why i have two buttons
[06:05:19] <jeffreylevesque> one that opens the port, and the other that closes
[06:05:22] <jeffreylevesque> i think it's hanging
[06:05:32] <jeffreylevesque> because the code is correct
[06:06:50] <Jac0bz1> Cork: well, by TinyMCEs function, window.send_to_editor(content)
[06:07:27] <mooncup> cheers Cork
[06:07:33] <Cork> Jac0bz1: ah, that would be a contentEditable element
[06:07:59] <Cork> Jac0bz1: you would have to or ask the mce to inject <br> or similar elements where the linebreaks are
[06:08:10] <Cork> or do it yourself
[06:09:00] <Jac0bz1> I tried to replace \n with \\n AND \r with \\r but that did't affect \r\n\r\n strings
[06:10:07] <mooncup> Cork: would I need to create a form or can I just have grab the information out of a file input?
[06:10:45] <Cork> mooncup: var data = formData(); data.append('file', $('#input')[0].files[0]);
[06:10:57] <mooncup> thanks very much
[06:11:12] <Cork> mooncup: note formData is fairly new
[06:11:21] <Cork> so it won't exist in older versions of ie
[06:11:45] <mooncup> hm that may be an issue
[06:11:47] <mooncup> how old are we talking?
[06:12:01] <Cork> mooncup: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData#Browser_compatibility
[06:12:27] <Cork> mooncup: only option if you want pre ie10 support is to use flash/silverlight or to not use ajax
[06:12:39] <Cork> (iframe)
[06:13:18] <mooncup> ew
[06:13:36] <Cork> ya, it kinda sucks
[06:13:55] <Cork> i normally just fallback to none ajax for ie<10
[06:14:24] <Cork> if they run a stone age browser they will have to make do with a stone age submit solution
[06:16:14] <mooncup> ah I've found a script that uses iframes
[06:16:17] <mooncup> I'll give that a bash
[06:16:54] <Cork> ya, there exit quite a few of those
[06:18:02] <jeffreylevesque> Cork, the jquery post works - which is actually a bad thing for me now :(
[06:18:07] <jeffreylevesque> thank you!
[06:18:12] <Cork> lol

When the user clicks the .done-button everything works fine, the class gets removed and the not-done-button class is added, now when you click the not-done-button class it doesn't remove the class and add the done-button class, any Idea why? - http://pastebin.com/zVpYyG2W
[06:30:27] <t4nk960> wait a min
[06:31:13] <t4nk960> yes
[06:31:21] <Cork> CapnKlutch: delegate the event listener
[06:31:31] <CapnKlutch> Cork, It work's on first click but not on the second click
[06:31:33] <Cork> if the element doesn't exist when you run the selector it won't find it
[06:31:36] <CapnKlutch> what does that mean
[06:31:40] <Cork> CapnKlutch: alternatively don't remove the button
[06:31:42] <Cork> just hide it
[06:31:48] <Cork> (have both in all the time)
[06:32:02] <CapnKlutch> It is the same button just a class is added and the text is changed
[06:32:45] <t4nk960> actually in second button ".not-done-button"  you use a add class before remove class  change it
[06:33:23] <CapnKlutch> t4nk960, I do/
[06:34:24] <Cork> CapnKlutch: ah, ok $('selector') looks in the dom for elements matching the selector
[06:34:33] <Cork> .on then loops the lists and binds event handlers
[06:34:34] <t4nk960> yes
[06:34:45] <Cork> you can't toggle between handlers by switching classes later on
[06:34:59] <Cork> unless you delegate the event handler to a parent
[06:35:12] <Cork> (though i would recommend just using $(this).hasClass() instead
[06:35:13] <Cork> )
[06:35:36] <CapnKlutch> Cork I think I will just have two buttons, that way I don't have to mess with the href
[06:35:52] <Cork> CapnKlutch: ya, that is a good idea
[06:35:55] <CapnKlutch> and hide the one I don't need
[06:36:06] <Cork> that is how i normally do it
[06:36:19] <Cork> js should just be logic, not data
[06:41:42] <Tekla> i have 2 event handlers listening for the same event ... is there any way to regulate which get triggered first?
[06:43:32] <CapnKlutch> Cork, now I can't access the prev() on the .not-done-button because there is an <a> element before - http://pastebin.com/7EeFE3hr
[06:43:47] <CapnKlutch> This no longer works - $( this ).prev('.item').removeClass( "done" );
[06:44:08] <Cork> CapnKlutch: $(this).prevAll('.item').first()
[06:44:27] <Cork> CapnKlutch: site note i normally wrap toggles like this in a span or div
[06:44:32] <Cork> and set the class on that
[06:44:38] <Cork> and have css do the toggling
[06:44:49] <CapnKlutch> Cork, thanks that did work
[06:45:05] <Cork> <span class="toggle"><button></button><button></button></span>
[06:45:28] <CapnKlutch> then what is the point of saying prev('.element') vs. saying just prev()
[06:45:43] <Cork> .toggle :last-child { display: none } .toggle.v2 :first-child { display: none; }
[06:46:11] <Cork> CapnKlutch: .prev('.item') "give me the previous sibling if it has the class item"
[06:46:27] <Cork> prev() just gives you the previous sibling
[06:46:43] <CapnKlutch> Ahh I see, but it only goes back 1
[06:47:23] <Cork> CapnKlutch: .prev maps directly to previousNode
[06:47:31] <Cork> no searching of the dom
[06:47:46] <Tekla> Cork: can you plz check pastebin.com/8sfYwXj4 ?
[06:47:51] <Cork> except it supports css filtering to check if the previousNode matches
[06:48:07] <CapnKlutch> Cork, now I understand thanks
[06:48:12] <Cork> Tekla: sure, something else?
[06:48:33] <Cork> Tekla: like a question about the content or something like that?
[06:48:38] <Tekla> well ... the show() hide() is "late"
[06:49:10] <Tekla> the updateallrows hasClass(collapsed) test result is wrong
[06:49:10] <Cork> there isn't any code in the fiddle
[06:49:17] <Cork> sorry pastebin
[06:49:26] <Tekla> hmm
[06:49:30] <Cork> (only html)
[06:50:57] <Tekla> what do you mean?
[06:51:59] <Tekla> actually i think maybe it's the difference between what .show()/.hide() does and adding the class that does the same ...
[06:52:14] <Tekla> i'll poke it and if that wasn't it i'll come back :)
[06:59:54] <Cork> Tekla: what i mean is i can't debug your js if all you share is some html
[07:01:32] <dieguezz> Cork,  sorry i was having lunch
[07:01:36] <dieguezz> let me see your fiddle
[07:02:10] <Cork> dieguezz: not forgiven, you should starve to death ;)
[07:02:21] <dieguezz> lol
[07:02:22] <dieguezz> :D
[07:02:30] <Cork> can't say i remeber the question though so... ^^'
[07:04:10] <dieguezz> http://jsfiddle.net/s8s3f9c7/7/ u told me that my fiddle was not ok, but.. i cant make yours work lol
[07:04:56] <Cork> ah, that one
[07:05:27] <Cork> dieguezz: yours first looped all select elements and grabbed the this.id (and this is where my fiddle was broken)
[07:05:39] <sl33k_> Has anyone transitioned from other roles to the frontend? What was your experience?
[07:05:41] <Cork> then you loop the ids and grab the elements you just looped again??
[07:05:50] <Cork> and build an object and push it into and array
[07:06:11] <Cork> dieguezz: fixed version http://jsfiddle.net/s8s3f9c7/8/
[07:10:51] <CapnKlutch> Cork, is there a way to submit a form using ajax without using a  plugin
[07:11:08] <CapnKlutch> using post
[07:11:26] <Cork> CapnKlutch: uh just run .submit() on the form?
[07:11:37] <Cork> ah using ajax
[07:11:44] <CapnKlutch> Example/
[07:13:02] <CapnKlutch> should I do this?
[07:13:03] <CapnKlutch> http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/submitting-ajax-forms-with-jquery#submitting-the-form-using-ajax-magic.js
[07:13:27] <dieguezz> lol Cork still roken, line 6 is failing
[07:14:02] <Cork> GAH
[07:14:08] <Cork> dieguezz: didn't close the function -_-'
[07:14:26] <Cork> or rather the } around the object in the map is missing
[07:14:57] <dieguezz> yeah i see, that was it
[07:15:02] <dieguezz> the object was not closed :p
[07:15:46] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[07:15:53] <Mag-neto> hello there!
[07:16:05] <dieguezz> well, ty vm Cork
[07:16:14] <dieguezz> ill try to find out how to solve the loading problem
[07:17:05] <Mag-neto> working on a code but it isn't working
[07:17:38] <Mag-neto> here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/shzotxag/
[07:19:00] <Mag-neto> I want that when I am on first page of the single page website the header should be hidden and as i scroll to second page it show the header.
[07:28:09] <CapnKlutch> Cork so now I submit my form and it updates the page with ajax
[07:28:48] <CapnKlutch> the new buttons added don't have the event listener added because they are added after the page load using ajax
[07:29:05] <CapnKlutch> Cork, how do I refresh the listner
[07:29:13] <CapnKlutch> *listener
[07:30:24] <alexclark> if i am appending elements to my dom, which have images, is there a way to trigger something when those images are loaded?
[07:32:36] <BillCriswell> alexclark: There's an imagesLoaded plugin that can make that easier for you.
[07:32:52] <alexclark> sweet, thanks BillCriswell
[07:32:57] <CapnKlutch> can someone help me
[07:33:35] <BillCriswell> It's essentially $('img').on('load', function () { }); though. Here's a plugin that's probably a little better to use: http://imagesloaded.desandro.com/
[07:46:11] <CoderJquery> Hi is there any jquery expert here?
[07:47:54] <CoderJquery> I need help regarding jquery UI draggable and sortable i have created a animated box! which you can drop your five products! but somehow the animation is not working properly :( need help?
[07:48:17] <CoderJquery> Anyone free for tonight to help me fix this bug?
[07:49:18] <CoderJquery> Wak up Rooom
[07:49:21] <CoderJquery> wake *
[07:52:49] <anli> I am using debugger; in a popup, that will not break the execution, it seems. Why not?
[08:02:54] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: People will help if they think they can help. Your question would benefit from a demo for people to hack at. The way you're asking is WAY too broad.
[08:17:27] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: Talk to me here.
[08:17:40] <CoderJquery> hi Bill
[08:17:50] <CoderJquery> http://dev.moxie.prospus.com/fill-your-box/
[08:17:54] <CoderJquery> this is my website
[08:18:08] <CoderJquery> as you can see  you can drag the stuff here!
[08:19:20] <CoderJquery> But the problem is that animation of close box and show box isnt working properply. I want when the cart item is less than 5 the box should remain open ! but when the cart is more than or equal to 5 the box should be closed!
[08:19:38] <CoderJquery>  It works sometimes but sometimes the box failed
[08:20:17] <CoderJquery> i have coded this logic on http://dev.moxie.prospus.com/wp-content/themes/Moxie/js/script.js
[08:22:11] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: Funny thing is I'm doing something very similar right now haha
[08:22:49] <CoderJquery> Yeah i am stuck with this code for 3 days Not able to resolve that animation thing!
[08:24:10] <CoderJquery> as you can see in script.js i am calling cb function
[08:24:24] <CoderJquery>  it calls conitionally showBox() and hideBox()
[08:24:56] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: So you want it to close automatically after the fifth item?
[08:25:13] <CoderJquery> Yeah its working as you can see
[08:25:14] <printForever> guys, need help really urgent!
[08:25:32] <CoderJquery> You will see a finish button popup in the box
[08:25:38] <CoderJquery>  when you have 5 items
[08:25:48] <CoderJquery>  but when you click on view or remove it
[08:25:59] <angels> Hi
[08:25:59] <printForever> situation: change HTML (append) when a input button is clicked
[08:26:07] <CoderJquery>  and changes the value from = and - sthen itfails
[08:26:14] <CoderJquery>  animation kinda break sometime
[08:26:16] <printForever> I forgot how to search through DOM
[08:26:17] <BillCriswell> printForever: What have you tried?
[08:26:26] <printForever> I just specified #id
[08:26:34] <printForever> but then I remembered
[08:26:40] <printForever> that is only for children elements
[08:27:21] <BillCriswell> printForever: Not following.
[08:27:25] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/hMjwu13F
[08:27:30] <angels> I am currently working with a framework called "Chayns" which works with its own android app, i would like to inspect some variables tho but the app and their developers give no tools for it, i can only use their methods within the app tho
[08:27:31] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: Yeah the animation is flaky.
[08:27:42] <angels> so i would like to "dump" them into a file or on the page as HTML
[08:27:58] <CoderJquery> Yeah Bill SOmetimes the box doesnt even close
[08:27:59] <CoderJquery>  try seeing in firefox
[08:28:00] <angels> Could you give me an advice how i can do that with jquery in a good way?
[08:28:05] <BillCriswell> and I'll never click a pastebin link again.
[08:28:05] <CoderJquery>  it takes time to load the flaps
[08:28:07] <BillCriswell> Fuck that website.
[08:28:36] <printForever> BillCriswell, I would like to detect a click on a button and change some HTML on the page (val). I know I got the button correct, but the rest of it is confusing.
[08:29:24] <BillCriswell> printForever: $('button').on('click', function () { $('input').val('New Val'); });
[08:29:46] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: It's simply too much code for me to go through right now.
[08:30:01] <printForever> BillCriswell what have I done wrong?
[08:30:16] <BillCriswell> printForever: Nothing I can see.
[08:30:25] <CoderJquery> Oh Bill
[08:30:59] <CoderJquery> Can you use firefox debugger? to get in the flow of code?
[08:31:02] <printForever> TypeError: $(...).on is not a function
[08:31:07] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: Not right now lol
[08:31:20] <CoderJquery> lol
[08:31:36] <BillCriswell> printForever: You're using old jQuery then. $('button').click(function () { $('input').val('New Val'); }); would be the same thing.
[08:31:42] <CoderJquery>  Bill i know this room is full of expert they can resolve my prob in less than 10 min
[08:31:47] <BillCriswell> printForever: Just make sure the HTML exists before you add the listener.
[08:32:13] <CoderJquery> if you dont know the element in adavnce what it will be you can use LIVE
[08:32:37] <BillCriswell> live is deprecated. Should be using .on with event delegation.
[08:32:51] <printForever> :C confused
[08:33:02] <CoderJquery> oh i didnt knew that ! thanks iwill read on api
[08:33:11] <BillCriswell> printForever: Wrap your code in $(function() { /* Your Code */ });
[08:34:20] <BillCriswell> printForever: http://jsbin.com/luborineta/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:34:41] <printForever> BillCriswell, I did that
[08:34:44] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/luborineta/2/edit
[08:34:44] <printForever> and it didnt work
[08:34:50] <CoderJquery> Bill you can also paste a solution of my problem in jsbin?
[08:34:52] <BillCriswell> Well then you're not selecting your elements right.
[08:34:54] <printForever> ouh
[08:34:55] <printForever> ok
[08:34:58] <CoderJquery> its just 500 something line of code
[08:35:03] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: No. Your problem isn't as simple.
[08:35:13] <CoderJquery> my bad luck :(
[08:35:37] <DevAntoine> hi
[08:35:41] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: Try to isolate the problems.
[08:35:53] <CoderJquery> i did
[08:35:58] <CoderJquery>  i created small functions
[08:36:00] <printForever> TypeError: $(...).on is not a function
[08:36:03] <CoderJquery> like showBox
[08:36:07] <CoderJquery> hideBox
[08:36:13] <DevAntoine> is it possible to attach data to an string which will be happened to an element? (I guess not)
[08:36:14] <CoderJquery> CB() << conditional box
[08:36:45] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Sounds like a lot of work. I'd just wrap it in a span.
[08:37:01] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: wut?
[08:37:12] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: I have objects I want to attach to the option element
[08:37:27] <DevAntoine> I need lot of info when one option is selected
[08:38:05] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Make a hash and use the keys of the hash as the value of the option elements. Much easier to manage.
[08:39:31] <DevAntoine> BillCriswell: and where am I supposed to store this hash?
[08:39:50] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: Wherever you want.
[08:39:50] <CoderJquery> Bill Since you are working on the same problem how much time will you take the problem to fix mine? just your preception and inception :D
[08:40:05] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: I'm not looking at your problem.
[08:40:22] <CoderJquery> Why i am too ugly coder or what?
[08:41:04] <BillCriswell> No. What you're doing is just more complicated than I feel like getting my head around now.
[08:41:04] <printForever> BillCriswell, how can I test that I am getting correct input and ID?
[08:41:12] <printForever> BillCriswell, console.log()...
[08:41:38] <BillCriswell> DevAntoine: http://jsbin.com/cecurecuje/1/edit?html,js,output something like this
[08:41:43] <CoderJquery> Oh okay Bill
[08:42:03] <BillCriswell> It's nothing personal lol
[08:42:26] <CoderJquery> yay! i know that how can it be personal we developer have rat life!
[08:42:54] <CoderJquery> when the code is not resolved we feel like sucking our mind
[08:43:23] <BillCriswell> I poop or take a nap when I get annoyed. Kind of like a giant baby. It usually works though.
[08:43:54] <CoderJquery> I go outside for a walk
[08:44:03] <CoderJquery> then the solutions pops up!
[08:44:07] <printForever> guys?
[08:44:12] <printForever> can you take a second for me
[08:44:15] <CoderJquery>  but nothing is coming these days on my head!
[08:44:22] <printForever> the HTML gets updated every few moments
[08:44:33] <printForever> and the .on or .click event dont work
[08:44:34] <BillCriswell> printForever: Do like console.log($('.some-selector').length);
[08:45:01] <BillCriswell> printForever: Updated every few moments via ajax or are you refreshing the page?
[08:45:17] <printForever> its tabbed
[08:45:26] <printForever> and I want to change the content of the LAST TAB
[08:45:36] <printForever> when you click on the button > GO TO LAST
[08:45:45] <BillCriswell> How is the content arriving in the tab?
[08:45:50] <printForever> ajax
[08:46:02] <printForever> console.log($('#bottom_payment_button').length);
[08:46:02] <printForever> 0 VM1347:2
[08:46:02] <printForever> undefined
[08:46:14] <robertmaxrees> gooooood morning #jquery
[08:46:43] <BillCriswell> printForever: You'll need a callback for when that tab loads in that case.
[08:47:05] <printForever> BillCriswell, then I'm out of luck, dont know how to use callbacks :S
[08:47:18] <BillCriswell> printForever: jQuery UI tabs?
[08:47:33] <printForever> I dont know, I think they are custom accordion
[08:47:48] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Morning.
[08:47:51] <fatmandown> hey guys, I have an issue where .remove() is causing the parent element to collapse, and an element next to that one shifts downwards as a result
[08:48:03] <fatmandown> the two elements are side-by-side using inline-block
[08:48:05] <printForever> fatmandown, its the CSS problem
[08:48:07] <BillCriswell> printForever: There's too much going on I don't know about to help you.
[08:48:08] <fatmandown> yeah I figured
[08:48:36] <printForever> BillCriswell, can we chat in private?
[08:48:43] <BillCriswell> printForever: Nope
[08:49:07] <BillCriswell> fatmandown: You can put a min-height of like 1px on the element.
[08:49:10] <fatmandown> Tried it
[08:49:21] <printForever> how do I "rescan" entire DOM?
[08:49:30] <fatmandown> clone it
[08:49:33] <HikaruBG> hi guys
[08:49:37] <printForever> Bill I will help fatmandown, if you help me :)
[08:49:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:49:44] <printForever> I'm great with CSS :)
[08:49:45] <printForever> :D
[08:49:55] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire channel for it :)
[08:50:05] <BillCriswell> fatmandown: An element would need width and height to not collapse
[08:50:07] <printForever> well, I cant disclose the code... :( thats the problem
[08:50:36] <fatmandown> It has both
[08:50:39] <printForever> BillCriswell, it may not have anything to do with that
[08:50:57] <HikaruBG> how can I trigger the default event on e.keyCode == 9 (Tab Key)
[08:51:02] <printForever> fatmandown, can you show me your code?
[08:51:08] <HikaruBG> I have a problem with FireFox Only
[08:51:08] <printForever> your page
[08:51:36] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG check every e.keyCode and if the e.keyCode !== 9, e.preventDefault();
[08:51:50] <fatmandown> printForever unfortunately I can't
[08:52:24] <BillCriswell> fatmandown: Are you sure?
[08:52:26] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ for those of you who cannot share code.
[08:52:41] <robertmaxrees> we don'e actually want a lot of it - a small, reduced test case is all we need :D
[08:53:16] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, I do that and all other keys I handle. The TAB key however won't focus on the next element, so I would need something opposite to preventDefault() actually I need something to enforce default action
[08:53:45] <DevAntoine> I see BillCriswell. Looks way simpler, thanks
[08:53:47] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG are you sure you have your tabindexes set correctly in your markup?
[08:54:12] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG because otherwise, what you're saying tells me there's another issue - could you show a fiddle maybe?
[08:54:38] <fatmandown> figured it out
[08:54:44] <HikaruBG> yes, they are correct
[08:54:45] <BillCriswell> fatmandown: http://jsbin.com/tirisonede/1/edit?html,css,js,output click the red block and you'll see it stays up.
[08:54:56] <fatmandown> was pulling a template via AJAX that wasn't set with inline-block
[08:55:28] <fatmandown> BillCriswell: thank you, I really appreciate it!
[08:55:38] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:56:01] <CoderJquery> Bill One last question do you know any website which has same type of functionality like the problem i am facing?
[08:56:40] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: I do not. Your issue is very specific to a lot of what is going on in your code.
[08:56:59] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, I am running jquery masking plugin, but it is modified to suite our mobile needs. However the Firefox browser with their new fixes  won't focus on the next element when the masked element is filled. all other elements work nice, and the input element in question also releases the focus to the next, when is empty.
[08:57:05] <CoderJquery> oh ok
[08:57:17] <HikaruBG> but wneh is filled - you can't focus on the next with TAB
[08:57:21] <CoderJquery> Thanks Bill for your time! i will go for a long walk now :(
[08:57:40] <BillCriswell> CoderJquery: Good luck!
[08:58:01] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG that doesn't help me see your code - whenever I hear somebody say that they're modifying plugins, that tells me there's something funky going on.  Somebody else might be able to help, but a fiddle might get you there even faster :)
[08:59:10] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, what is the fiddle URL? :)
[08:59:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:15:08] <CapnKlutch> Why is this registering as 2 clicks? - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qEEQMR
[09:15:29] <CapnKlutch> I need to run ajax on the click but it seems that it is firing twice
[09:16:42] <robertmaxrees> is that binding in the done/success callback of your ajax call?
[09:17:16] <CapnKlutch> I didn't add the ajax code in but before I do I see that it is registering 2 clicks
[09:18:38] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, do you see it in the console?
[09:18:43] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting.
[09:19:49] <CapnKlutch> but when I add the listener to #cb-alt I register 1 click
[09:20:00] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the checkbox/label combo in there is what's causing it.
[09:20:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/2hsczoo1/ yep
[09:26:21] <CapnKlutch> I will just listen for the input and grab the href from the prev
[09:26:32] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, thanks for your time
[09:27:15] <robertmaxrees> I'd avoid using the a tag at all.
[09:29:16] <CapnKlutch> robertmaxrees, can you take a look at it, I am trying to grab the href from prev and it's not working
[09:29:17] <CapnKlutch> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qEEQMR
[09:29:27] <robertmaxrees> don't wrap it with the A tag since it's not valid >.>
[09:30:20] <CapnKlutch> so I should just use a data attr
[09:30:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:31:10] <robertmaxrees> if you HAVE to use this markup, and I'd really suggest against it, you want this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vEEQPp
[09:31:13] <CapnKlutch> how do I access data-attr
[09:31:20] <robertmaxrees> bind to the change event of the input.
[09:31:32] <robertmaxrees> your current html isn't valid though.
[09:31:37] <robertmaxrees> and is going to be very fragile.
[09:31:54] <robertmaxrees> swap the a out for a span at least and feel free to use a data attribute - you can access those using .data()
[09:32:29] <CapnKlutch> I tried using .data() - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qEEQMR
[09:32:36] <CapnKlutch> what did I do wring
[09:32:47] <CapnKlutch> wrong
[09:32:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't want .prev() in that case - you want .closest()
[09:33:11] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.checkbox-alt') in your case.
[09:33:22] <robertmaxrees> .prev() is for sibling elements.
[09:36:23] <CapnKlutch> Thanks it works!
[09:42:26] <sharax> hi friends
[09:42:38] <sharax> ghi friends
[09:47:12] <thinkxl> what is the new tool for debugging IE
[09:47:13] <thinkxl> ?
[10:10:09] <NoiseEee> the built in debugger?
[10:29:22] <talexb> This is odd .. I'm trying to update a page from within the load function (I have to wait for an iframe to load), and it's getting to the console.log statements, but not the code right afterwards. No errors in the console log.
[10:38:12] <brettfrable> yalll - do you know why this will work if i put it in the console but not on page load
[10:38:47] <brettfrable> http://pastebin.com/mYRn9zeV
[10:52:15] <barryhjames> Having trouble with some propagation, hoping someone could catch what is going wrong in IE8. http://bit.ly/11Lf7CZ
[10:58:59] <BillCriswell> brettfrable: The element isn't there when you try to select.
[10:59:10] <brettfrable> yeah
[10:59:12] <BillCriswell> If your script is in the <head> wrap it in $(function() { ... });
[10:59:14] <brettfrable> thats what the prob is
[10:59:32] <brettfrable> and its after the body
[11:00:31] <barryhjames> The script is above the closing body tag. Should I move it up to the head?
[11:00:49] <BillCriswell> brettfrable: <body><script>...</script> ?
[11:01:03] <BillCriswell> or <script>...</script></body> ?
[11:01:19] <BillCriswell> second one wouldn't need the document ready, first still would.
[11:01:45] <barryhjames> It’s an included .js external file, it’s not directly in the HTML.
[11:02:20] <brettfrable> Huh?
[11:04:18] <barryhjames> Doesn’t matter, never mind. So right now it is above the closing body tag. I had it there so that it wouldn’t affect page load time. But do you think it should go in the head instead?
[11:05:25] <BillCriswell> I confused you two I think. My bad.
[11:05:49] <BillCriswell> barryhjames: Script is fine in the footer. Are you loading what you're trying to select via ajax?
[11:06:19] <barryhjames> No, it’s in the .html already.
[11:09:12] <talexb> Ugh .. shift-refresh fixes so many things. Erg.
[11:09:29] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[11:19:30] <frank_o> Hi! Is there a way to simulate actual mouse movement with jQuery?
[11:19:51] <cjohnson> brettfrable: the code you pasted has a syntax error
[11:19:56] <cjohnson> you're missing the }); at the end
[11:20:06] <brettfrable> yeah
[11:20:10] <cjohnson> but otherwise, you'd have to tell us what "doesn't work" means
[11:20:14] <brettfrable> not missing the syntax when I'm using
[11:20:17] <brettfrable> missed it when i pasted
[11:20:35] <brettfrable> meaning an image loads on the page without the src attribute
[11:20:46] <brettfrable> this will load a default image
[11:20:53] <cjohnson> this code wouldn't load any images onto the page
[11:20:54] <brettfrable> but its only working half the time
[11:20:58] <brettfrable> duh
[11:21:00] <brettfrable> yes it does
[11:21:22] <cjohnson> you're going to have to paste your real code
[11:21:29] <brettfrable> that is my real code
[11:21:37] <cjohnson> well then fix your syntax errors, there are several
[11:21:46] <cjohnson> but there's nothing in this code that would execute any function of any kind
[11:21:53] <cjohnson> or insert anything into a page as it stands
[11:22:27] <cjohnson> all you're doing is defining a variable which contains some functions. nothing here calls any of those functions
[11:22:30] <brettfrable> jQuery(function ($) {
[11:22:30] <brettfrable>     var helpers = {
[11:22:30] <brettfrable>         Elements: {
[11:22:30] <brettfrable>             picEl: $('.profile_pic img:not([src])'),
[11:22:30] <brettfrable>             defaultImg: "http://community.linkedin.com/themes/linkedin/images/ghosts/person/ghost_person_60x60_v1.png"
[11:22:31] <brettfrable>         },
[11:22:31] <brettfrable>         checkProfilePic: function() {
[11:22:32] <brettfrable>             helpers.Elements.picEl.attr('src', helpers.Elemen
[11:22:32] <brettfrable>             console.log(helpers.Elements.defaultImg);
[11:22:33] <brettfrable>         },
[11:22:33] <brettfrable>         init: function() {
[11:22:34] <cjohnson> jfc
[11:22:34] <brettfrable>             helpers.checkProfilePic();
[11:22:34] <brettfrable>         }
[11:22:35] <brettfrable> });
[11:22:53] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/9735117
[11:22:53] <cjohnson> use a pastebin.
[11:22:55] <brettfrable> there ya go
[11:22:59] <cjohnson> and it's *still* got syntax errors
[11:23:32] <brettfrable> haha no
[11:23:33] <brettfrable> that doesnt
[11:23:37] <cjohnson> okay. good luck.
[11:24:04] <frank_o> brettfrable: are you familiar with http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ ?
[11:24:22] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/9735122
[11:24:28] <brettfrable> there cjohnson
[11:24:33] <brettfrable> I'm pasting from vim
[11:24:34] <brettfrable> sorry
[11:24:45] <frank_o> check that out though
[11:24:54] <brettfrable> but the problem is the images are being loaded on to the page after that script is run
[11:24:56] <cjohnson> still has syntax errors. still doesn't have anything that would execute any of these functions
[11:25:05] <frank_o> on the benefits of live testcases
[11:25:06] <brettfrable> yes it does
[11:25:11] <brettfrable> because if i paste that in console
[11:25:14] <cjohnson> k
[11:25:14] <brettfrable> it switches the images
[11:25:20] <brettfrable> ill screencast it for you if you'd like
[11:25:28] <cjohnson> go for it
[11:28:14] <brettfrable> cjohnson
[11:28:15] <brettfrable> http://pastie.org/9735135
[11:28:16] <brettfrable> there
[11:28:21] <brettfrable> that is everything
[11:28:29] <brettfrable> my bad on the bad on the bad paste
[11:30:34] <brettfrable> cjohnson befor:
[11:30:35] <brettfrable> http://i61.tinypic.com/2myb4bd.png
[11:31:02] <cjohnson> I don't see anything necessarily wrong in the code here so you'd have to give more details in the context of your page
[11:31:07] <brettfrable> and after i run the code
[11:31:09] <brettfrable> http://i60.tinypic.com/wjayio.png
[11:31:16] <brettfrable> the problem is it doesn't work on page load
[11:31:45] <brettfrable> it's right before the closing body tag
[11:32:01] <cjohnson> jQuery(function($) {
[11:32:07] <cjohnson> means it will wait for document ready either way
[11:32:59] <frank_o> Is there a way to make ones mouse cursor move repeatedly in a circular formation using jQuery? Going to be used to test Parallax.js's (http://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) load on ones GPU / CPU.
[11:33:22] <cjohnson> put a console.log in the main function here as well as inside the init function brettfrable and see if it's firing on page load
[11:33:32] <brettfrable> did that
[11:33:34] <brettfrable> it does fire
[11:33:50] <cjohnson> alright so start debugging the pieces
[11:33:53] <cjohnson> find out which one isn't working
[11:34:00] <brettfrable> it's not that it isn't working
[11:34:08] <brettfrable> it works if i paste it into console
[11:34:15] <brettfrable> it has to do with when the images load I think
[11:34:21] <brettfrable> or the image tag rather
[11:34:35] <brettfrable> because this is checking for an image tag without the src attribute
[11:37:20] <cjohnson> if the page is loaded with img tags without src attribute it will find them
[11:37:33] <cjohnson> if the img tags without src are added via some other JS... you may need to explicitly time things
[11:37:53] <cjohnson> only trigger this after the code that added the img tags fires
[11:38:41] <cjohnson> but in general: double check your selectors if things just aren't working sometimes but are working others
[11:38:56] <cjohnson> console.log their .length to make sure they're actually picking up the elements in question
[11:47:56] <spaceguy> the node to jquery
[11:48:03] <spaceguy> anyone heard about it
[11:48:04] <spaceguy> ?
[11:48:59] <spaceguy> anyone?
[11:50:50] <cjohnson> how high are you
[12:03:12] <NoiseEee> space high
[12:05:03] <koos147> hey
[12:05:53] <koos147> when selecting the yearrange 2015:2015 in datepicker it has a strange result
[12:06:19] <koos147> when selecting 5 november 2015 the text box show 5 november 2014 to me
[12:07:20] <koos147> $(function() {
[12:07:21] <koos147>       $( '#2datepicker' ).datepicker({
[12:07:21] <koos147>       changeMonth: true,
[12:07:21] <koos147>       changeYear: true,
[12:07:21] <koos147>    dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy',
[12:07:21] <koos147>    yearRange: '2015:2015',
[12:07:21] <koos147>    monthNamesShort: [ 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'mei', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'okt', 'nov', 'dec' ],
[12:07:22] <koos147>    dayNamesShort: [ 'zon', 'maa', 'din', 'woe', 'don', 'vri', 'zat' ],
[12:07:22] <koos147>     });
[12:08:17] <cjohnson> use a pastebin koos147 don't just paste into the channel
[12:08:22] <cjohnson> jsfiddle preferable
[12:08:35] <cjohnson> so you can include html and make it a live demo
[12:15:15] <BillCriswell> Not pastebin.
[12:15:19] <BillCriswell> Anything but pastebin.
[12:18:14] <slax0r> laravel.io/bin
[12:18:20] <koos147> i never worked with the site but i think you should have http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/ now
[12:18:32] <slax0r> oh, this is jquery :)
[12:22:05] <cjohnson> koos147: I don't see any code in there...did you save?
[12:22:08] <cjohnson> there's a save button at the top
[12:22:10] <cjohnson> er update
[12:22:32] <koos147> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/3/
[12:23:02] <BillCriswell> slax0r: haha
[12:23:29] <slax0r> I think I can be forgiven
[12:23:38] <slax0r> I'm battling with unit tests for almost 12 hours already :P
[12:24:04] <BillCriswell> Anything besides pastebin.com is ok in my eyes. Full page video ads with sound... no thanks.
[12:24:28] <cjohnson> koos147: you can add external resources to your fiddle on the left there, add jquery ui's CSS and JS (as well as jquery itself). the point of the fiddle is to get a "working example" of your bug
[12:24:28] <slax0r> meh, adb+
[12:27:03] <cjohnson> koos147: also your JS is missing a line at the end there
[12:27:42] <koos147> i try to copy and past it from the page but there is a lot of other date
[12:27:52] <koos147> let me check it again :)
[12:30:20] <koos147> since i never have worked with this page before what is wrong? it works when i put it on my local server
[12:31:13] <cjohnson> you are missing a line of your JS, and you haven't added jquery or jquery-ui JS files to the "external resources" on the left there
[12:31:31] <koos147> i did it ( link is now ending on 4)
[12:32:10] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/4/
[12:32:13] <cjohnson> still missing a line of JS
[12:32:17] <cjohnson> console spewing errors
[12:33:34] <koos147> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/6/    what line are you missing ?  it works on http://fnetonline.nl/lab/www.rent2camp.nl/verhuur-camper-reserveren.php
[12:33:52] <cjohnson> and your <script> references won't work...they're relative paths
[12:34:28] <koos147> should i only call the name of the file
[12:34:42] <koos147> again on my own server i know the relative path and it works
[12:34:44] <cjohnson> you need a full absolute path
[12:34:50] <cjohnson> since this is coming from not your server
[12:34:52] <cjohnson> but jsfiddle.net
[12:35:22] <koos147> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/7/
[12:35:45] <koos147> sorry
[12:35:53] <koos147> see it didn't copy the path
[12:35:56] <cjohnson> yep, though I see now you had already added them as external resources on the left there, sorry
[12:36:07] <koos147> oke
[12:36:20] <cjohnson> so now the <script> tags are unnecessary
[12:36:37] <koos147> nr 8
[12:36:53] <cjohnson> perfect, and I also moved the CSS into that interface as well: http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/9/
[12:37:06] <cjohnson> so now the task at hand is that your JS is still invalid
[12:37:18] <cjohnson> you have unclosed parens and braces
[12:38:43] <koos147> });  added on line 10
[12:38:53] <koos147> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/10/
[12:39:22] <cjohnson> bingo. and one last problem, if we look at our console, is that it's saying jQuery is undefined within jquery-ui.js
[12:39:44] <cjohnson> so if you look at the external resources list the ui file is listed before jquery.js... delete it and re-add to move it to the bottom
[12:39:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/11/
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> just use the dropdowns in the upper left ;)
[12:40:33] <cjohnson> ahh jquery-ui checkbox isn't listed for the jqueyr version I pick
[12:40:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:41:02] <koos147> done
[12:41:12] <koos147> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/12/
[12:41:17] <koos147> now we can see the issue
[12:41:21] <cjohnson> awesome, working fiddle
[12:43:00] <cjohnson> hrm
[12:43:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/63k2bg0q/13/
[12:43:30] <robertmaxrees> is this what you wanted?
[12:43:49] <koos147> no still the same
[12:43:57] <robertmaxrees> (what was the issue?)
[12:43:58] <cjohnson> it's entering 2014 into the field
[12:43:59] <robertmaxrees> i was late to the party.
[12:44:03] <cjohnson> for 2015 dates
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[12:44:47] <cjohnson> it looks like it might be a bug I don't see anything obvious. if you remove the yearRange and explicitly pick 2015 in the dropdown it uses teh right date
[12:45:07] <koos147> if i allow 2014:2015 then it works
[12:45:22] <koos147> http://jsfiddle.net/63k2bg0q/14/
[12:45:38] <cjohnson> even if you remove changeYear: with 2015:2015 it still enters 2014 to the field
[12:47:04] <cjohnson> Note that this option only affects what appears in the drop-down, to restrict which dates may be selected use the minDate and/or maxDate options.
[12:47:09] <cjohnson> under yearRange
[12:48:06] <koos147> let me try that
[12:48:25] <koos147> but i still think it is a bug or a misunderstanding from my side
[12:49:02] <robertmaxrees> iirc you want minDate and maxDate
[12:49:55] <cjohnson> koos147: http://jsfiddle.net/19bhy1h5/1/
[12:50:29] <cjohnson> changeYear disabled (since they can't change it anyway): http://jsfiddle.net/19bhy1h5/2/
[12:50:57] <koos147> that is what i want
[12:51:10] <koos147> thank you
[12:51:35] <cjohnson> no prob
[12:51:55] <koos147> is the changeyear function working as designed?
[12:53:19] <cjohnson> not sure what you mean
[12:53:41] <koos147> i have a working script know but are still intrested in ....
[12:53:51] <koos147> is it my fault or is it a bug?
[12:53:52] <cjohnson> I still think there's a bug in the yearRange implementation but I don't see anything odd about changeYear
[12:54:11] <cjohnson> but...the docs also suggest you were using the wrong option to accomplish what you wanted. so both at fault I think
[12:54:45] <koos147> no problem i am happy it works now
[13:11:48] <boombadaroomba> http://jsfiddle.net/TLJsv/11/ Trying to have it check user time and test it against our local business time.
[13:12:25] <cjohnson> what's the problem/question?
[13:13:39] <boombadaroomba> I am currently in PST. I need it to replace html if we are open, in our PST time.
[13:14:02] <boombadaroomba> IE. if someone in germany at 10:30pm accesses it. our phones are open
[13:17:23] <morfeo_81> hi
[13:20:38] <morfeo_81> I want create a simple form and use jquery ad jsonp. So I have difficult to create the form. I need to use 2 input and use as get value and print in jsonp call. At the moment I want to be able to use for print and change id=red
[13:20:54] <morfeo_81> here there is a script https://bpaste.net/show/80693924b79c
[13:21:15] <morfeo_81> no work because he .click say are not present
[13:21:19] <morfeo_81> anay help?
[13:25:22] <morfeo_81> Any idea?
[13:56:32] <billy> anyone know why this doesn't include the submit button's values in the form data when POST'ing? (you can view the POST in dev tools) http://jsfiddle.net/0cy19qxe/
[13:56:52] <billy> it only happens if I call e.target.submit inside of function
[13:59:10] <billy> compared to: http://jsfiddle.net/s1duqgnL/
[13:59:58] <cjohnson> there is something with the form submission buttons. I think their value only gets included if that's the button you actually clicked
[14:00:11] <cjohnson> for instance you can have 2 submit buttons and if you click the first one it won't include the second one's value
[14:00:57] <billy> yeah I get that, but if you submit the form programatically in the same thread it'll include the value
[14:06:09] <cjohnson> well you could try calling .click on the submit button, or include a hidden field
[14:06:21] <cjohnson> I see the same behavior you do though, even if I use $('#test').get(0).submit()
[14:06:34] <cjohnson> once it's inside setTimeout it stops counting it as a successful control
[14:06:37] <cjohnson> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2
[14:07:09] <cjohnson> or rather, so it seems
[14:13:59] <CapnKlutch> Ok so I have a jquery form that updates the content on a page, specifically a <ul>, I have a content editable on the item and that works fine. Now when I add a new item the content is pulled it through ajax and displayed, the problem is that the event handlers for click get attached on the dom load so the new content can no longer use the contentEditable function I have here - http://pastebin.com/j4Xcdm4D
[14:14:30] <cjohnson> you need event delegation
[14:14:40] <cjohnson> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:14:45] <CapnKlutch> To overcome this I used $( ".list" ).on( "click", '.big-checkbox', function() { // but that doesn't seem to work with the blur
[14:15:11] <cjohnson> you can use the same syntax for blur
[14:15:17] <cjohnson> (you'll have to not use .blur()
[14:15:26] <cjohnson> .on('blur', 'selector', ...
[14:15:38] <cjohnson> also use .on instead of .bind
[14:15:47] <CapnKlutch> cjohnson, thanks that makes sense
[14:15:56] <t4nk717> Anyone comfortable with Google Charts/jquery-csv? Offering a $20 bounty or reddit gold or whatever to fix an issue I'm having. Basically just creating a ChartRangeFilter Visualization.
[14:17:26] <CapnKlutch> cjohnson, like so right? - http://pastebin.com/QachtehB
[14:18:23] <CapnKlutch> is there an on keypress?
[14:19:33] <jakey_> it looks like some drunk took a fist full of whitespace and hurled it at your code
[14:20:13] <cjohnson> CapnKlutch: yes there is
[14:20:23] <cjohnson> and yes it does
[14:20:26] <cjohnson> :P
[14:20:30] <CapnKlutch> cjohnson, thanks for your help I got it working
[14:24:34] <CapnKlutch> cjohnson, how can I access currentText from the blur method - http://pastebin.com/mPFmL1Et
[14:25:10] <CapnKlutch> I know it's not in scope but I don't really know how to do it
[14:25:50] <CapnKlutch> anyone?
[14:36:04] <cjohnson> you can't if it's not in the same scope
[14:36:15] <cjohnson> paste your code back up let's see what you're trying to do
[14:36:43] <CapnKlutch> cjohnson, I got it again, lol
[14:36:55] <CapnKlutch> I want to know how to force a blur
[14:37:00] <cjohnson> .trigger('blur')
[14:37:02] <CapnKlutch> $(".list").on('keypress', '.text', function(e){ return e.which != 13; });
[14:37:28] <CapnKlutch> so when a user clicks enter that element goes to blur so it can save the content
[14:42:07] <rigel> i cannot for the life of me figure out what im doing wrong with trying to unset a radio button
[14:43:55] <jakey_> element.checked = false ?
[14:47:46] <rigel> jakey_: $('input:checked').prop('checked', false);
[14:48:06] <rigel> do i need an each or something?
[14:49:42] <rigel> it doesnt even unset the first radio button group
[14:51:02] <patie> hi its possible submit form trought ajax but with simulating (fake) submit button ?
[14:51:17] <patie> simulating click on submit button*
[14:52:43] <patie> trigger click with ajax in maybe ?
[15:03:54] <andrew9183> whats the question
[15:13:50] <cohitre> ?submit @ patie
[15:14:14] <patie> but submit send form without ajax or not ?
[15:14:26] <cohitre> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[15:14:28] <patie> or event will be submit on submit button and in callback i call ajax ?
[15:14:46] <cohitre> yes. bind to the submit event and then pass the form fields to ajax
[15:15:02] <patie> so he send which submit button was clicked right
[15:15:13] <cohitre> call event.preventDefault() inside your callback to prevent the browser from changing the page
[15:15:35] <patie> i need he tell server side which submit was clicked
[15:15:42] <patie> if its possible with this :D
[15:15:46] <patie> i try
[15:16:12] <patie> but imho its not real :D
[15:16:50] <patie> because in callback is normal ajax call and he dont tell server side nothing about which submit button was clicked
[16:22:19] <cjohnson> rigel: you can't uncheck a radio button...it's a radio button. not a checkbox ;)
[16:34:23] <robertmaxrees> sure you can ;)

[16:44:27] <rubyonrailed> Does anyone know a plugin that compares two strings in a html view and highlights the difference.  I'm trying to use goole-diff-match-patch, but The string i'm comparing includes html tags, and I need the output to be html safe.
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean by "html safe"?
[17:03:02] <KLVTZ> Not sure if this is possible, but could I add a the $(window).resize as a prototype to another div?
[17:03:10] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: probably means that <script>alert('!')</script> will print as text and not be executed
[17:03:27] <KLVTZ> listening for when an element is resized, sort of like window.resize
[17:04:34] <KLVTZ> I was thinking of js prototype.call or prototype.apply
[17:10:37] <doug64k> KLVTZ: mutation observers might do it
[17:11:01] <doug64k> I doubt reflow fires those though
[17:11:01] <KLVTZ> doug64k: i just realized you can apply .resize to any element.
[17:11:15] <doug64k> KLVTZ: it won
[17:11:15] <KLVTZ> doug64k: it was to my understanding that it only applied to window.
[17:11:22] <doug64k> t do that
[17:11:27] <KLVTZ> oh it won't?
[17:11:55] <KLVTZ> i did a $('div').resize and the function does exist.
[17:12:14] <doug64k> that is the shorthand that calls .on('resize' for you
[17:12:23] <KLVTZ> ahhh...
[17:13:09] <doug64k> KLVTZ: who moves the element? reflow?
[17:13:18] <KLVTZ> is the .on('resize', func) only allowed only for window?
[17:13:41] <doug64k> KLVTZ: it doesnt spray you with resize events with the page reflows, no
[17:15:24] <doug64k> want a way that always works? poll. absolutely need more speed? DOMAttrModified deprecated FF+Chrome only event
[17:17:17] <doug64k> KLVTZ: if the element resize is happening under your control you can .trigger resize to invoke the window's resize handling
[17:21:42] <KLVTZ> doug64k: the real issue I'm faced with is that I have a page which shows two different videos depending on screen width. Everything works fine except when you expand a video to full desktop width. It won't show the mobile video but that of the desktop video.
[17:22:12] <KLVTZ> i was thinking of listinging on the video element but i realized that when you expand the video, it obiously sources the desktop video
[17:22:34] <KLVTZ> the resize is under my control or more like the browsers width
[17:23:17] <doug64k> KLVTZ: you need to take control of the src of that video element in js
[17:23:28] <doug64k> KLVTZ: the resize event isnt important
[17:24:06] <doug64k> KLVTZ: you want it to stay on the mobile video if it is small at first then they maximize it?
[17:24:43] <KLVTZ> that is correct, and it does work on actual mobile emulation, it just doesn't stay on that mobile when ypu expand it on desktop.
[17:24:59] <KLVTZ> expand on desktop with a mobile shrinked viewport
[17:25:18] <KLVTZ> I do take advantage of the src attr based on the window width.
[17:25:33] <KLVTZ> the resize is used only if i expand an shrink the current window.
[17:32:43] <KLVTZ> doug64k: any suggestions? if not, totally cool. It's so minute that I think I can put it off.
[17:49:19] <doug64k> KLVTZ: so disabling the resize handler fixes it then
[17:50:43] <doug64k> KLVTZ: changing the .on('resize'  to   .one('resize'   will make it only handle the first resize event - then somewhere late in the initialzation, .trigger('resize') to fire the one-time resize
[18:04:20] <KLVTZ> doug64k: thanks I'll play around with your suggestion.
[19:00:57] <tab1293> with jquery's on function how can I pass additional arguments to the event handler without calling the function on the instantiation?
[19:01:34] <tab1293> $(document.body).on('click', '#play', this.onPlayClick(this));
[19:02:14] <tab1293> the onPlayClick is called on when that line is hit
[19:41:11] <sgnl> tab1293 wrap it in anonymous callback function?
