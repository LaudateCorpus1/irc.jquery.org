[05:51:49] <Tabberino> Hey guys
[05:51:57] <Tabberino> I'm loading an URL into a div with AJAX
[05:52:14] <Tabberino> is there a way to conditionally do something if the URL being loaded 404s?
[05:59:03] <Woet> Tabberino: yes, it is.
[06:00:53] <Woet> yes, there is. *
[06:03:15] <Tabberino> I'm trying to find something that works but it just breaks everything
[06:03:19] <Tabberino> http://jsfiddle.net/qwx2a5th/ here's a fiddle
[06:03:39] <Tabberino> Sorry
[06:03:41] <Tabberino> Wrong fiddle
[06:04:51] <Tabberino> So the one I linked actually works
[06:05:04] <Tabberino> This is what I added to throw an error if the loaded stuff 404s
[06:05:21] <Tabberino> http://jsfiddle.net/qwx2a5th/1/
[06:05:47] <Woet> Tabberino: did you try reading the docs? http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[06:05:48] <Tabberino> Damnit
[06:05:50] <Tabberino> This
[06:05:51] <Tabberino> http://jsfiddle.net/qwx2a5th/2/
[06:06:00] <Woet> Tabberino: same question
[06:06:02] <Tabberino> Yeah, ofc
[06:06:17] <Woet> Tabberino: ok, so why aren't you using the 404 event?
[06:06:32] <Woet> Tabberino: sounds like it'd do exactly what you need.
[06:06:41] <Woet> Tabberino: statusCode event to be exact.
[06:07:02] <Tabberino> One sec, gm
[06:07:43] <Tabberino> Interesting
[06:07:55] <Woet> Tabberino: it's literally the only result for "404" on the documentation
[06:07:58] <Tabberino> So just by pasting this in, it will apply on all 404 results?
[06:08:03] <Woet> Tabberino: try it and see.
[06:08:03] <Tabberino> I've found it

[06:09:33] <Tabberino> christ
[06:09:36] <Tabberino> these guys are
[06:09:39] <Tabberino> so annoying
[06:09:47] <Tabberino> i'm trying it now woet
[06:11:14] <Tabberino> Won't work like so
[06:11:32] <Tabberino> http://jsfiddle.net/qwx2a5th/6/
[06:12:15] <Woet> Tabberino: your examples wont work because you're not loading jQuery
[06:12:20] <Tabberino> oh fuck
[06:12:22] <Tabberino> I saw just now
[06:12:24] <Woet> Tabberino: and you can't just copy/paste just that. put it in your actual AJAX request.
[06:12:37] <Woet> Tabberino: you're not doing an actual AJAX load anywhere.
[06:13:00] <Tabberino> i did load(var)
[06:15:18] <Woet> Tabberino: then you need to make it a part of that code..
[06:15:39] <Woet> Tabberino: or at least ajaxSetup.
[06:15:52] <Woet> Tabberino: you gotta spend some more time getting familiar with jQuery / coding.
[06:16:01] <Tabberino> hm, I suppose I'll have to read up on ajaxSetup
[06:16:16] <Tabberino> yeah i just blindly copypaste and check if the brackets make sense
[06:16:24] <Tabberino> if i'm lucky it'll work on the 3rd try
[06:16:28] <Woet> Tabberino: that's not how you code I'm afraid
[06:18:19] <Tabberino> probably not

[09:09:59] <pagios> i need help, i am getting in http.responseText an array of X elements , i need to create X divs accordingly on the current hTML file using ajax, how cna i do that please?
[09:15:58] <pagios> hello?
[09:39:32] <pavonia> pagios: What part are you having problems with exactly?
[10:06:30] <khobo> gentlemen
[10:06:41] <khobo> can somoene pls pls help
[10:06:42] <khobo> http://jsfiddle.net/bwr4cg02/3/
[10:06:47] <khobo> i need to turn this pushdown
[10:06:56] <khobo> into an overlay
[10:06:59] <khobo> like how it operates on
[10:07:05] <khobo> https://tinyurl.com/ybqkrmx9
[10:56:32] <pagios> i am not able to get a clicklistener on all images, only first works https://pastebin.com/hiH2mnDQ
[10:56:35] <pagios> what am i missing
[10:57:09] <taplar> the element doesn't exist on the page yet, for you to find it
[10:57:28] <taplar> you need to do: img.on('click', ...
[10:57:32] <pagios> ?
[10:57:48] <taplar> also don't repeat ids.  it's invalid by web standards
[10:58:22] <pagios> Tekla, but each image when clicked should console.log its src
[10:58:44] <taplar> right, ?
[11:01:11] <taplar> pagios: is your question about what i said about binding on the img, or about the duplicate ids?
[11:01:43] <pagios> taplar, i need to output img.src of the corresponding image
[11:02:06] <taplar> and i told you how to fix your binding.  so now I'm asking what you are confused about
[11:03:31] <pagios> i did fix my binding to be img.
[11:05:03] <taplar> ok, so with that, if you want to log the image src, you can either log this.src, or accept the e (event) into the click handler and log the e.target.src
[11:05:36] <taplar> or actually with how you have it you could log the img.attr('src')
[11:09:03] <pagios> thank you

[14:59:36] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/6hv57gky/1/
[14:59:42] <khobo> how do i toggle a body overflow hidden
[14:59:54] <khobo> i've created a class called .overflow-hide {overflow:hidden}
[15:00:06] <khobo> that code is for a pushdown hamburger menu that goes full screen
[15:00:09] <khobo> and i need to hide the body behind it
[15:03:42] <khobo> HTMLBodyElement.toggleClass('overflow-hide');
[15:03:42] <khobo> ?
[15:17:03] <SideFX> Has anyone had any problems with focusout not working on mobile browsers?
[15:24:26] <robertmaxrees> not that i can think of./
[15:25:05] <SideFX> Do you have to have jquery mobile version for it to work?
[15:25:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not a mobile version - it's a framework.
[15:25:36] <robertmaxrees> that also uses jquery.
[15:25:39] <robertmaxrees> but nope.
[15:25:59] <robertmaxrees> have you made a test case that shows the problem?
[15:26:20] <SideFX> I'm not sure what to do, there's no web console on the android browser
[15:26:48] <robertmaxrees> you can connect chrome to it.
[15:27:23] <robertmaxrees> mobile emulation seems to work.
[15:28:53] <robertmaxrees> humm, but the true mobile browser doesn't./
[15:30:35] <robertmaxrees> odd.
[15:31:53] <SideFX> Mmmm
[15:32:06] <SideFX> I used firefox mobile mode and it works in there
[15:32:35] <robertmaxrees> the emulator, you mean?
[15:32:45] <SideFX> When you hit ctrl shift m
[15:33:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the emulator.
[15:34:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd fire up mobile chrome and connect it to your desktop for debugging.
[15:34:48] <SideFX> Ok I will use that, thanks for help

[19:10:03] <robertmaxrees> *huh?
[19:10:17] <robertmaxrees> why not add/remove a class to do it?

[19:11:36] <khobo> i dunno i've been working it all day and i dunno how to do it
[19:11:46] <robertmaxrees> where do you want to add it?
[19:11:55] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've tried./

[19:12:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:12:49] <khobo> okay hold on
[19:12:53] <khobo> let me just paste the lin
[19:12:53] <khobo> e
[19:12:56] <robertmaxrees> you're linking 150+ lines of js plus a ton of other unrelated stuff.
[19:13:01] <khobo> yeah one second
[19:13:01] <khobo> sorry
[19:13:05] <robertmaxrees> a link to the page is going to be worse.
[19:13:18] <robertmaxrees> show the isolated js itself.
[19:13:19] <khobo> i've been trying to paste in this line
[19:13:20] <khobo> HTMLBodyElement.toggleClass('overflow-hide');
[19:13:32] <robertmaxrees> where?
[19:13:37] <khobo> i created an .overflow-hide {overflow:hidden} class
[19:13:50] <robertmaxrees> and where is HTMLBodyElement defined?
[19:13:59] <khobo> i thought HTML bodyelement
[19:14:05] <khobo> referred to <body>
[19:14:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:14:07] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/6hv57gky/6/
[19:14:28] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/6hv57gky/7/
[19:14:30] <khobo> this is where i'm at
[19:14:48] <khobo> how do i select the body i guess is my question
[19:14:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:14:56] <khobo> because i cant even get it to change background colors
[19:15:00] <robertmaxrees> oh, using jquery?
[19:15:02] <khobo> yeah
[19:15:09] <robertmaxrees> well yeah - HTMLBodyElement.toggleClass('overflow-hide'); is going to throw an error.
[19:15:10] <khobo> should i do this in the On Click
[19:15:15] <robertmaxrees> how would you select the body using css?
[19:15:39] <khobo> $(bod).toggleClass('overflow-hide');
[19:15:40] <khobo> ?
[19:15:42] <khobo> i tried that too
[19:15:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:15:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:15:50] <robertmaxrees> how do you select anything using jquery?
[19:16:02] <khobo> *squints
[19:16:04] <robertmaxrees> $(body) is close - what are you missign there?
[19:16:14] <khobo> '' 's?
[19:16:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:16:24] <khobo> i swear i tried that too
[19:16:26] <khobo> let me plug it in tho
[19:16:34] <khobo> where do you think it fits within the logic though?
[19:16:42] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[19:17:01] <robertmaxrees> though I'
[19:17:10] <robertmaxrees> *i'd specifically use addClass and removeClass
[19:17:22] <khobo> shit
[19:17:28] <khobo> that worked
[19:17:31] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:17:33] <khobo> i put it in the onclick
[19:17:44] <robertmaxrees> which?
[19:17:53] <khobo> toggle class
[19:17:59] <robertmaxrees> which onclick
[19:18:05] <khobo> the firstone
[19:18:08] <khobo> when you click the hamburger menu
[19:18:17] <robertmaxrees> also: any reason you have multiple $(document).ready(function() {?
[19:18:22] <robertmaxrees> and $(function() { ?
[19:18:33] <khobo> no idea
[19:18:37] <khobo> i've just been getting help
[19:18:41] <khobo> and pasting everything in
[19:18:44] <khobo> trying to get this to work
[19:18:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:18:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:18:46] <khobo> it all works
[19:18:51] <khobo> but i definitely need someone to go through and clean it up
[19:18:53] <khobo> after i'm finished
[19:18:54] <robertmaxrees> so you're just copy/pasting code people give you?
[19:19:04] <khobo> out of the kindness of their hearts
[19:19:05] <khobo> yes
[19:19:12] <khobo> essentially
[19:19:18] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[19:19:25] <khobo> i mean it all works =/
[19:19:29] <khobo> no errors get output
[19:19:39] <khobo> but has been a pain in the ass
[19:19:46] <robertmaxrees> so somebody could give you something that could, say, log keystrokes on the site?
[19:19:56] <khobo> i mean i think i'd notice that
[19:20:05] <khobo> and so many eyes are on it
[19:20:07] <khobo> helping me
[19:20:12] <khobo> they would too
[19:20:14] <khobo> it's for my photo portfolio
[19:20:17] <khobo> i don thtink anyone careas
[19:20:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:20:42] <robertmaxrees> there are so many problems with that methodology but alright.

[19:21:06] <khobo> and am trying to do this to further my career so many i can get shooting gigs
[19:21:13] <khobo> so this is how it's gotta be done right now sadly
[19:21:26] <khobo> i havent updated the code for the new overlay dropdown
[19:21:30] <khobo> but that's basically what it looks like right now
[19:21:48] <robertmaxrees> right, you're basically having people build the site for you for free.
[19:24:00] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:33:38] <khobo> i meannnnn
[19:33:41] <khobo> i did everything else

[19:33:55] <khobo> and the JS is
[19:34:02] <khobo> about 150 lines
