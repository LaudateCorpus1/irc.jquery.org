[00:00:41] <Guest30> Morning.
[00:01:15] <Duikb00t> Morning*
[00:03:52] <hellyeah> i know it is simple question but can you tell me why it is not working
[00:03:53] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/Lk14qk0v/3/
[00:05:25] <SirLagz> hellyeah: because you're trying to select the "buttonClass" id, and not the class
[00:05:41] <SirLagz> hellyeah: you want $('.ButtonClass')
[00:05:54] <SirLagz> the # is for id, the . is for class
[00:07:02] <hellyeah> ops
[00:07:06] <hellyeah> am doing same mistake
[00:07:39] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  no result again i expected to see some output in console http://jsfiddle.net/Lk14qk0v/4/
[00:08:29] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:08:35] <hellyeah> do i need document.ready?
[00:08:38] <SirLagz> hellyeah: well, javascript variables don't start with a $ for starters
[00:08:52] <Robdgreat> SirLagz: some do
[00:08:57] <SirLagz> hellyeah: also 'var' is a reserved word
[00:08:59] <Robdgreat> they just aren't required to
[00:09:00] <hellyeah> it is jquery variable i suppose?
[00:09:07] <SirLagz> Robdgreat: ah, I guess that's true
[00:09:07] <hellyeah> i did $var
[00:09:24] <Robdgreat> SirLagz: by convention, variables containing jquery objects have a $ in front
[00:09:30] <hellyeah> is it a problem i used $ to meantion it is jquery variable
[00:10:10] <SirLagz> Robdgreat: righto. learn something new every day heh
[00:10:41] <hellyeah> just a sec
[00:11:13] <Robdgreat> hellyeah: you might give your variables more descriptive names than $var, anyway :)
[00:11:20] <cyberbrai> Nee small help on audio video calling widget,  with js just want a basic idea of calling widget,
[00:18:35] <FilipNortic> If there is async : true in $.ajaxSetup() does that mean the page will run all ajax as sync?
[00:21:00] <hellyeah> do you have any answer for me?
[00:21:09] <Kartagis> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on page prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'bindRemove' <--- what am I doing wrong to get this? http://termbin.com/1qa3
[00:21:19] <Kartagis> hello by the way
[00:21:29] <hellyeah> is this ie error
[00:21:30] <hellyeah> ?
[00:21:46] <hellyeah> i saw this error when try to execute js in i.e.
[00:21:46] <Kartagis> hellyeah: no, mobile
[00:21:52] <hellyeah> hmm ic
[00:22:06] <hellyeah> it can be about jquery version
[00:22:16] <Kartagis> they say jquery mobile causes it
[00:31:12] <SirLagz> hellyeah: last you said 'wait a sec'...then disappeared.
[00:53:41] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  i did typo
[00:53:44] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[00:56:29] <SirLagz> hellyeah: what was the code again?
[00:56:45] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  http://jsfiddle.net/Lk14qk0v/7/
[00:56:56] <hellyeah> it is ButtonClass i was buttonClass
[00:57:16] <hellyeah> but i sensed that applying camelCase might be better in terms of naming convention
[00:58:05] <SirLagz> hellyeah: ok...well your html code has "ButtonClass" but you're selecting "buttonClass"
[00:58:13] * Kartagis pulls out hair
[00:58:20] <SirLagz> hellyeah: so it still won't find anything
[00:58:35] <hellyeah> ops
[00:58:38] <hellyeah> here http://jsfiddle.net/Lk14qk0v/8/
[00:58:46] <hellyeah> guess forgot to update
[01:00:16] <SirLagz> hellyeah: ok...well I see things in the console with that code
[01:01:03] <hellyeah> i need to change name attribute of button
[01:01:11] <hellyeah> jquery has something for doing this
[01:01:21] <FilipNortic> hellyeah: if you get stuck in js with just a few lines then running them line for line in the console can be a good idea
[01:01:22] <Cork> .attr('name', newValue)
[01:01:50] <Cork> or this.name = newValue
[01:01:53] <hellyeah> FilipNortic:  i guess it is good for debugging purpose.
[01:02:59] <Cork> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/Lk14qk0v/10/
[01:04:24] <hellyeah> Cork:  so index and element is option params for each() ?
[01:04:38] <Cork> hellyeah: all arguments are optional in js
[01:04:40] <Cork> always
[01:04:52] <hellyeah> ic
[01:06:53] <hellyeah> Cork:  do i need to remove 'name' before changing it?
[01:06:59] <Cork> no
[01:07:13] <Cork> just set the value you want it to have
[01:07:28] <hellyeah> ah okey
[01:07:50] <Cork> "'name' + Math.random()" is the value in the example
[01:07:59] <hellyeah> ic
[01:21:47] <dan2k3k4> How can I set these two lines to use one line? $('.category_header[ng-category-feed-id="198414"]'); and $('.category_header[ng-category-feed-id="1329"]');
[01:22:12] <dan2k3k4> like adding an 'inArray' or an 'OR' for the two ids? :/
[01:22:18] <Cork> $('.category_header[ng-category-feed-id="198414"], .category_header[ng-category-feed-id="1329"]');
[01:22:30] <FilipNortic> I'm dealing with some old code in one of our apps and I get warings for sync ajax but I can't find any in the code. Can I trace the warning from jQuery somehow?
[01:22:35] <Cork> or $('.category_header').filter('[ng-category-feed-id="198414"], [ng-category-feed-id="1329"]');
[01:24:11] <hapi> or $('.category_header').attr(ng-category-feed-id) === 198414 || $('.category_header').attr(ng-category-feed-id) === 198414
[01:24:36] <Duikb00t> Are there modernizr users here?
[01:24:43] <hapi> (attr parameter had to be string)
[01:24:44] <Cork> hapi: no, that isn't a selector
[01:24:47] <Cork> and it doesn't parse
[01:24:50] <FilipNortic> So I guess my question is can i trace jQuery warnings some how or do I need to debug the whole page
[01:25:05] <dan2k3k4> thanks Cork
[01:25:06] <Cork> dan2k3k4: a third option is or $('.category_header').filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).data('ng-category-feed-id'), ['1329', '198414']) != -1 })
[01:25:07] <Duikb00t> I would like to start testing / creating a fallback for SVG images so it renders a .png. Now I get what Modernizr can do but what is the best way to 'implement it' ?
[01:25:19] <Duikb00t> Just pick 1 rule from the website and implement that or how does that part exactly works?
[01:25:20] <dan2k3k4> hmm third looks good
[01:26:11] <Cork> Duikb00t: you really need svg fallback?
[01:26:23] <Cork> support is quite universal in fairly modern browsers
[01:26:26] <Duikb00t> Reverse actually, png fallback.
[01:26:41] <Cork> well i meant a fallback for svg
[01:26:49] <Duikb00t> Im using a .svg logo but http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg
[01:27:01] <Duikb00t> IE8 seems not the happy one here
[01:27:11] <Cork> and you really care about ie8?
[01:27:49] <Cork> Duikb00t: if yes, then i would have the logo in a wrapping element
[01:27:51] <Duikb00t> It's the website's logo which is an svg, so it would be nice if was shown :)
[01:28:00] <Cork> and set the png as a css background image in a conditional comment
[01:28:06] <Cork> that way it will "just work" for ie8
[01:28:14] <Cork> but the rest of the web won't suffer for it
[01:28:37] <Duikb00t>  in a conditional comment
[01:28:38] <hapi> Cork: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwZVKZ
[01:28:44] <Duikb00t> As in :  a IE only comment?
[01:28:49] <hapi> it works well for me with attribute selector too
[01:28:54] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[01:29:09] <Cork> Duikb00t: or actually you could just have a separate <img> tag in a comment
[01:29:10] <Duikb00t> Well yes indeed that's what I tought :)
[01:29:14] <Cork> would be even simpler
[01:29:43] <Duikb00t> <!--[if IE 8]><p>Welcome to Internet Explorer 8.</p><![endif]-->
[01:29:45] <Duikb00t> Brrrr
[01:29:56] <Cork> hapi: except you've made a one liner into a 5 liner...
[01:30:30] <hapi> Cork, the each is just for presentation, it works witout as well
[01:30:35] <hellyeah> i am targetting i.e. does it make any different os using jquery uncompressed or minified version?
[01:30:42] <Cork> hapi: no, it doesn't
[01:30:53] <Cork> your code does something completely different then the question
[01:31:14] <Cork> hapi: the result of the code should be a jquery result set with two elements in it
[01:31:19] <Duikb00t> hellyeah production environments I always use the minified version.
[01:32:15] <Duikb00t> Cork what is your favourite way of implementing SVG,
[01:32:17] <Cork> hapi: so the code would have to be http://jsfiddle.net/6vyruwqf/
[01:32:24] <Cork> Duikb00t: implement?
[01:32:26] <hellyeah> regardless of browser_?
[01:32:26] <Duikb00t> 'inline' with the code or linking to the file.
[01:32:27] <Cork> what do you mean?
[01:32:39] <Cork> normally just as an img tag
[01:32:47] <Duikb00t> <img src="kiwi.svg" alt="Kiwi standing on oval"> as that
[01:32:51] <Cork> ya
[01:33:07] <hapi> Cork, oh i tought he just want to simplify the two lines, by i dont saw he want to came back with a jq object
[01:33:12] <hapi> you're right, sorry:)
[01:33:24] <Cork> hapi: the lines he used selected the result
[01:33:34] <Cork> it wasn't tests
[01:33:53] <Cork> Duikb00t: only exception is if you need to reach into them from js
[01:33:57] <hapi> it's clear now:)
[01:34:15] <Cork> Duikb00t: or if you need to have the svg react to user actions
[01:34:29] <Cork> cause img explicitly deny that
[01:37:26] <Duikb00t> No it's just a site logo.
[01:58:25] <Duikb00t> http://unicode.johnholtripley.co.uk/2261/  looks pretty ok to use no?
[02:31:48] <dimi1947> how I can achieve the effect that once a user starts filling an input...anothe input gets to be disabled...
[02:32:05] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/1/
[02:32:45] <dimi1947> I want when name.lastname gets filled....company name becomes disabled...and vice versa
[02:35:48] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/3/
[02:41:09] <dimi1947> I have made some progress....
[02:41:12] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/
[02:42:17] <dimi1947> one issue though is how enable again the coname input when the name lastname boxes are amptied?
[02:42:34] <dimi1947> and vice verca
[04:09:58] <rindolf> Hi all.
[04:14:40] <hellyeah> damn i wrote simpel ajax but i forgot how to write
[04:14:47] <hellyeah> can you give me small example,
[04:25:51] <dimi1947> has anyone worked with the form group method of jquery validate?
[04:26:27] <dimi1947> jquery validate site seems to be down and so I cannot look at the docs
[04:26:58] <dimi1947> I want to achieve "fiil these 2 input boxes OR the third one"
[04:40:34] <hellyeah> how can i check button is click or not is there any property for button when you click it become true
[04:50:09] <hellyeah> anyone here
[04:51:36] <hellyeah> hey
[04:51:59] <hellyeah> i need to console information of clicked button i need to control it how can i do that? https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/9/
[04:52:27] <rindolf> hellyeah: hi.
[04:52:34] <rindolf> hellyeah: what kind of button is it?
[04:52:51] <hellyeah> input button
[04:53:04] <hellyeah> cant you reach jsfiddle?
[04:53:25] <rindolf> hellyeah: yes, i saw.
[04:53:37] <rindolf> hellyeah: well, push buttons don't remain clicked.
[04:53:51] <rindolf> hellyeah: you click them once and they invoke an operation.
[04:54:00] <rindolf> hellyeah: maybe you want checkboxes?
[04:54:03] <hellyeah> hmm so i cannot do it that way
[04:54:18] <rindolf> hellyeah: no, you cannot.
[04:54:20] <hellyeah> no i understand
[04:54:30] <hellyeah> i have to wrap it with click event
[04:55:04] <taplar> bind a click event
[04:55:19] <taplar> long time no see, :)
[04:56:08] <hellyeah> this one worked
[04:56:15] <hellyeah> taplar:  thanks how ya doin
[04:56:25] <taplar> can't complain
[04:56:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am struggling with c# and asp.net
[04:56:35] <hellyeah> sometimes pass to js
[04:56:40] <hellyeah> switchable
[04:56:46] <hellyeah> taplar:  good to hear
[04:56:49] <taplar> ah
[04:57:01] <hellyeah> that one seems work https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/12/
[04:57:15] <hellyeah> but i only print information of clicked one
[04:58:06] <hellyeah> so it seems i need if
[04:58:19] <hellyeah> and check for changing the clicking state of button
[04:58:22] <taplar> you only want it to print the clicked one?
[04:58:26] <hellyeah> cause button didnt stay clicked
[04:58:29] <fallenstorm> hi, i have file input. And i want to add files several times in it. I need to remember all iterations. For exmaple, i add 2 files from folder 1 and 3 files from folder 2 sequentially. Is there some solution?
[04:58:30] <hellyeah> yes
[04:58:35] <taplar> then you don't need an each
[04:58:36] <hellyeah> taplar:  thats right
[04:59:24] <hellyeah> yeah right
[05:00:34] <hellyeah> taplar actually want to accompolist is
[05:01:02] <rindolf> fallenstorm: hi, is this jQuery?
[05:01:17] <hellyeah> try to produce a string in a format that is ?param1=var1&param2=var2&param3=var3
[05:01:26] <hellyeah> it is query string format
[05:01:31] <hellyeah> is it possible in jquery
[05:01:36] <taplar> you can serialize a form
[05:01:38] <fallenstorm> rindolf, i wish to do it with jquery
[05:01:44] <rindolf> hellyeah: yes, there's jquery.querystring
[05:01:45] <hellyeah> serialize form?
[05:01:49] <rindolf> fallenstorm: how?
[05:02:02] <fallenstorm> rindolf, this is the question
[05:02:13] <rindolf> fallenstorm: what does jQuery have to do with files?
[05:02:29] <hellyeah> rindolf:  not this one rgiht
[05:02:32] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/ ?
[05:02:41] <rindolf> hellyeah: no, let me see.
[05:03:10] <taplar> here's the one i was referring to http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:03:18] <hellyeah> first treulst in the google hmm
[05:03:26] <hellyeah> taplar:  is it for me?
[05:03:42] <taplar> yeah, are you wanting to get those params from your form or something else?
[05:03:58] <hellyeah> from my forms yes
[05:04:06] <hellyeah> buttons are in forms
[05:04:07] <taplar> yeah, that'll do it for you
[05:04:12] <hellyeah> let me see
[05:06:47] <hellyeah> i only dont know how to pass this query string to c# variable
[05:07:05] <taplar> uh, that would just be used on an ajax request
[05:07:24] <hellyeah> yeah i know
[05:07:31] <hellyeah> i didnt make sense now i know :X
[05:07:42] <hellyeah> but i guess
[05:07:51] <hellyeah> i can define a textarea or something
[05:07:58] <taplar> what for?
[05:08:01] <hellyeah> and put this query string to the innertext
[05:08:26] <taplar> i'm confused.  why do you need to do that
[05:08:32] <hellyeah> i have to use query string in a c# function to get records when you click button
[05:08:44] <hellyeah> when you click button it will trigger c# function
[05:08:50] <hellyeah> that takes querystring
[05:09:10] <hellyeah> anyway i am confused right now may be i can clear my mind
[05:09:17] <taplar> right.... so you send an ajax request with those parameters, and then it would just pull them off of the request like it would any normal parameter passed in
[05:09:19] <dimi1947> I have this code here  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/   it supposes to diable the #coname if typing inside the name,lastname input...the problem is that some times it does not work...and I cannot find out why
[05:09:52] <rindolf> hellyeah: I have a plugin for that here - https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/fc-solve/src/4f2025f19fd7f99d77c0fb348ef09f59cda9735a/fc-solve/site/wml/lib/jquery/jquery.querystring.js?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default - but I don't know where i copied it from.
[05:09:55] <hellyeah> yes seems like that
[05:10:35] <taplar> dimi1947: got a use case for when it does not work?
[05:10:37] <hellyeah> taplar:  so i will get this script as query string in javascript and pass it to c# as parameter
[05:10:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  thats just an idea
[05:10:50] <hellyeah> i am hoping that make sense
[05:10:53] <taplar> no what's i'm saying is
[05:11:09] <taplar> if you make a request, ex http://mysite?a=1&b=2
[05:11:15] <taplar> how would you normally get 'a'?
[05:11:44] <hellyeah> string s = Request.QueryString["a"];
[05:11:49] <taplar> ok
[05:12:10] <taplar> so serialize your string and do "http://mysite?"+ serializedString
[05:12:18] <taplar> then it will work just like that for all those fields
[05:12:38] <hellyeah> but the point is i cannot type anything to url
[05:12:58] <hellyeah> just button will trigger method with proper parameters that contains part of query strings
[05:13:07] <taplar> which can fire an ajax request
[05:13:24] <hellyeah> well
[05:13:25] <hellyeah> yes
[05:13:39] <hellyeah> when button clicked it fires ajax request
[05:13:52] <hellyeah> which will serialize the string
[05:14:18] <hellyeah> and pass to some area like text box and i will get this query string from that textbox in c#
[05:14:27] <hellyeah> and split it then use those as parameters
[05:14:34] <hellyeah> thats my thought
[05:14:38] <hellyeah> i hope that make sense
[05:14:43] <taplar> why can't just send it with ajax?
[05:14:44] <dimi1947> when start typing inside the name field....the coname field ought to become disabled but it does not
[05:14:47] <hellyeah> sorry for my english is not clear
[05:15:06] <dimi1947> I think there must be a problem with the conditional logic
[05:15:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  i dont understand question clearly
[05:15:31] <taplar> you keep saying write it to a textara
[05:15:31] <hellyeah> can you ask again
[05:15:34] <taplar> textarea
[05:15:48] <taplar> i'm asking, why can you not when they click the button, serialize the form, and make the ajax request then
[05:16:19] <hellyeah> it can be that
[05:16:25] <hellyeah> i am kinda new on that business
[05:16:36] <hellyeah> i just try to find some way desgning an algorithm
[05:16:39] <hellyeah> first thing first
[05:16:47] <hellyeah> let me serialize string i have
[05:17:21] <hellyeah> :=)
[05:18:49] <taplar> dimi1947: it keeps the coname enabled when you type in name because the last name is still blank
[05:18:53] <taplar> your doing an or
[05:19:13] <taplar> if either are blank, the coname will not be disabled
[05:19:31] <dimi1947> yes...
[05:19:37] <hellyeah> taplar:  why it didnt serialize https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/16/
[05:20:01] <taplar> dimi1947: so you want it to disable the coname if either first or last name are not blank?
[05:20:58] <taplar> hellyeah: you should really bind your click event outside of the ajax handler
[05:21:01] <taplar> not sure why your doing that
[05:21:39] <taplar> also 'this' is referring to the button clicked
[05:21:39] <hellyeah> i am beginner
[05:21:44] <zfmf> hi, what is the best way  to create a jquery object from an existing html string
[05:21:48] <taplar> you need the form so $(this).closest('form')
[05:22:01] <taplar> zfmf: $(htmlString)
[05:22:07] <Cork> zfmf: $($.parseHTML(html))
[05:22:11] <taplar> or that
[05:22:17] <Cork> $() might fail
[05:22:21] <taplar> ah
[05:22:45] <Cork> so always use $.parseHTML unless you can make sure it always starts with a tag as the first character
[05:22:56] <zfmf> taplar: Cork: problem is it's then not searchable, when i search $(string).find('html') i get undefined
[05:23:11] <taplar> html isn't usually a tag
[05:23:15] <Cork> zfmf: there isn't any html dom element
[05:23:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  you meant this  https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/19/
[05:23:29] <Cork> zfmf: dom can only contain what is inside body
[05:23:49] <Cork> so if you try to parse a full html page it will error correct what isn't dom elements
[05:24:06] <Cork> (you shouldn't give jquery full html pages)
[05:24:16] <taplar> hellyeah: sure
[05:24:24] <hellyeah> let me try to fix smt
[05:24:35] <zfmf> Cork:  taplar: ok thanks
[05:25:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  i couldnt get information when you click button why is that https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/20/
[05:25:53] <taplar> serialize works on form elements
[05:25:58] <hellyeah> ops
[05:26:20] <hellyeah> i cannot console $("ButtonClass").value too
[05:26:24] <hellyeah> when you click button
[05:26:25] <taplar> also don't look up the element in your handler
[05:26:27] <hellyeah> it said undefined
[05:26:33] <taplar> use this to reference the one clicked
[05:26:36] <hellyeah> humm
[05:26:42] <Cork> hellyeah: .value is dom
[05:26:48] <Cork> jquery uses .val()
[05:28:08] <hellyeah> Cork:  this.val() ?
[05:28:13] <dimi1947> yes taplar
[05:28:20] <Cork> hellyeah: no...
[05:28:25] <Cork>  $("ButtonClass").value =>  $("ButtonClass").val()
[05:28:29] <taplar> dimi1947: so that would be the condition you need to write, :)
[05:28:41] <Cork> hellyeah: also don't forget the dot for the class selector
[05:28:54] <hellyeah> i supposed this refers to ButtonClass in that case
[05:29:29] <hellyeah> it is done
[05:29:29] <taplar> 'this' references whatever the context is.  in this case your handler is dealing with a click event on the button so yes, 'this' here is for a button
[05:29:39] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/25/
[05:29:41] <Cork> hellyeah: no, the code you have fails cause it tries to use dom properties on the jquery object
[05:30:11] <taplar> again, don't lookup the button in the handler
[05:30:21] <hellyeah> not this time https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/25/ :=)
[05:30:56] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/26/
[05:31:23] <Cork> hellyeah: you can't replace this with $() cause it will select all the buttons with that class
[05:31:27] <Cork> not just the one you clicked
[05:31:39] <hellyeah> thats right
[05:31:44] <hellyeah> this refer spesific one
[05:32:04] <hellyeah> is that true?
[05:32:11] <taplar> yes
[05:32:20] <hellyeah> okey
[05:32:28] <hellyeah> i just have to serialize it now i guess
[05:32:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  you said serialize works with form
[05:32:46] <taplar> yep
[05:32:58] <hellyeah> but i have use this text come from this.value
[05:33:00] <hellyeah> and turn to querystring
[05:33:17] <hellyeah> so i need to use button i dont see how form get involved here
[05:33:23] <hellyeah> if you dont mind can you explain
[05:33:35] <taplar> serialize() works with form
[05:33:43] <taplar> it finds children inputs and serializes them
[05:34:04] <hellyeah> humm
[05:34:12] <hellyeah> like
[05:34:15] <taplar> if your wanting to serialize just that one field, it would be something different
[05:34:30] <hellyeah> closest('form').next(); ?
[05:34:39] <taplar> just closest(
[05:34:42] <taplar> just closest('form')
[05:34:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  i will serialize the text in the
[05:34:53] <hellyeah> clicked button
[05:35:01] <hellyeah> you will see text when you click button right
[05:35:15] <taplar> in that case just do encodeURIComponent(this.value)
[05:35:44] <hellyeah> let me see
[05:36:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:36:45] <hellyeah> %
[05:37:03] <hellyeah> this character should be & i mean i dunno may be asp.net use different notation
[05:37:13] <taplar> var something = encodeURIComponent(this.name) +'='+ encodeURIComponent(this.value)
[05:37:24] <hellyeah> ?param1=value1&param2=value2 this is notation
[05:37:24] <b-ot> hellyeah: memorised “param1=value1&param2=value2 this”.
[05:37:40] <hellyeah> b-ot:  are you bot?
[05:37:40] <b-ot> hellyeah: reply hazy, try again.
[05:37:46] <hellyeah> yeah bot
[05:37:49] <hellyeah> :D
[05:40:01] <hellyeah> i need to change the design a bit https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/30/
[05:40:32] <taplar> = not ?
[05:40:40] <hellyeah> humm
[05:40:46] <hellyeah> here is notation here
[05:41:10] <hellyeah> ?param1=value1&param2=value2&param3=value3
[05:41:24] <hellyeah> question mark instead of equal at the beginning of query string
[05:41:27] <taplar> i'm familiar with the http param notation.  key value pairs are separated with =, not ?
[05:41:39] <hellyeah> key = value
[05:41:43] <taplar> yes
[05:42:03] <hellyeah> if you seperate two things you use & instead of % at least in asp.net
[05:42:09] <taplar> yes
[05:42:11] <hellyeah> ? is the beginning character
[05:42:14] <hellyeah> not =
[05:42:17] <taplar> yes
[05:42:44] <hellyeah> if you put = instead of ? it puts = at the beginning of query string
[05:42:51] <taplar> no...
[05:42:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:42:58] <hellyeah> sec
[05:42:59] <taplar> your building the key=value part
[05:43:44] <morfin> hello
[05:44:06] <morfin> is there sane way to modify datepicker without modifications of internal variables?
[05:44:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/34/ i dont understand why it prints name of button "ctl02" but here https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/34/
[05:45:08] <taplar> those are the same link?
[05:45:14] <hellyeah> yes
[05:45:18] <taplar> and it's using the name of the button clicked
[05:45:21] <hellyeah> sorry i pasted twice
[05:45:37] <hellyeah> ah
[05:45:41] <hellyeah> this.name sorry
[05:45:42] <DarsVaeda> maybe it is because I'm half sedated but why does it scroll to the left (and return offset.left = 40) if you click the green area? https://jsfiddle.net/dkcq5fd4/
[05:46:01] <hellyeah> anyway i understood the logic
[05:46:09] <hellyeah> i will do some design chances
[05:46:20] <hellyeah> changes
[05:46:57] <taplar> i did have one question though
[05:47:12] <taplar> what was the reasoning for giving your submit buttons different names?
[05:48:08] <hellyeah> well i have several project
[05:48:33] <hellyeah> and each projects have different names
[05:48:39] <hellyeah> each project has its own table
[05:48:48] <hellyeah> when you click button you will get spesific table
[05:49:21] <hellyeah> name of button just indicates what project table is in
[05:49:27] <taplar> but they all belong to the same form?
[05:49:45] <hellyeah> well i will create button dynamically
[05:49:50] <hellyeah> so it will belong to same form
[05:50:15] <taplar> so on your back end, you having to look to see which of the n buttons was clicked?
[05:50:25] <hellyeah> yes
[05:50:31] <taplar> ok, so that leads to my point
[05:50:45] <hellyeah> have a look which one is clicked
[05:50:52] <hellyeah> and get corresponding query string
[05:50:53] <taplar> if you name them all the same, you don't have to look to see which one was clicked.  you always look for the one name, and check it's value to know which was clicked
[05:50:57] <taplar> can make it easier
[05:50:58] <hellyeah> use that query string in function
[05:51:08] <hellyeah> well
[05:51:15] <hellyeah> this can cause casuality
[05:51:28] <hellyeah> because people will observer the system
[05:51:31] <hellyeah> because people will observe the system
[05:51:41] <hellyeah> and they will know which table in which button
[05:52:00] <hellyeah> so they just observe button in the screen
[05:52:15] <hellyeah> and button will be animated in case any failure occurs
[05:52:23] <hellyeah> they will click it and see the table
[05:52:36] <hellyeah> or they will report it this project has some failure check it out
[05:52:43] <hellyeah> so name of button can make life easier
[05:52:56] <hellyeah> button with same names can be confusing
[05:52:56] <taplar> uh, your talking about the users?
[05:52:58] <samssh> Punctuation, not line breaks please
[05:53:05] <hellyeah> samssh:  sorry
[05:53:20] <hellyeah> taplar:  system will be used by person
[05:53:25] <hellyeah> people*
[05:53:29] <taplar> right...
[05:53:57] <taplar> users typically do not see the name of a button
[05:54:02] <taplar> unless they inspect the html of the page
[05:54:07] <hellyeah> i work on a big bank they have million of service we divide this service into tables and bind to button. And when you click this button you will get related tables
[05:54:25] <hellyeah> think about thousand record everyday bank is operation 24 / 7
[05:54:37] <taplar> that's not the point
[05:54:43] <taplar> the users don't see the name
[05:54:48] <hellyeah> yes
[05:54:59] <hellyeah> button will document itself
[05:55:10] <taplar> the value cant document it
[05:55:15] <taplar> cant = can
[05:55:18] <hellyeah> you remember the principle you meantioned to me. Variables name should be self documented
[05:55:20] <zumba_addict> good morning folks
[05:55:28] <taplar> it's not a variable, it's an html element
[05:55:30] <hellyeah> no it just meantion itself
[05:55:47] <taplar> if you want to describe it, that can be an id or class
[05:56:00] <taplar> but in this case it makes the backend more complicated
[05:56:05] <taplar> to have different names
[05:56:06] <hellyeah> but use will only see the name of button as facade of button right
[05:56:28] <hellyeah> taplar:  thats the job we are dealing with
[05:56:34] <hellyeah> rigt :)
[05:56:44] <taplar> huh?
[05:57:12] <taplar> lol, your not agreeing with me and then yes!
[05:57:14] <taplar> :S

[05:57:57] <hellyeah> suggestion right but you are like teacher to me

[05:59:26] <hellyeah> take a break
[06:00:16] <zumba_addict> we're using ajaxPrefilter - here is the code - http://pastebin.com/Zmj0wY4b Our setting is 3 retries when our an ajax call fails. I noticed that when the retry also fails, it won't go into our error callback. It will only go to error callback when it's done with the 3 retries
[06:00:24] <Kartagis> enough trolling
[06:00:27] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/4twhevnf/ <--- why doesn't this one see me as authenticated?
[06:01:20] <zumba_addict> The effect of retries is not good when the type of call is jsonp
[06:02:13] <zumba_addict> so I would like to know if there is a global JQuery style capturing of error. I was thinking there might be one because there is an ajaxPrefilter
[06:03:34] <taplar> Kartagis: looks like the call to nodejs is the one that failing with a 403
[06:03:56] <taplar> Kartagis: do you need to give it the token as well?
[06:04:27] <Kartagis> taplar: while logging in, yes
[06:04:44] <Kartagis> otherwise I get CSRF validation failure
[06:05:56] <zumba_addict> any ajax expert around? :D
[06:06:15] <taplar> don't look for experts.  just ask
[06:08:05] <Kartagis> no nodejs here
[06:08:51] <zumba_addict> taplar, ok, i'll just wait until someone have ideas about my question few mins ago
[06:09:07] <zumba_addict> Kartagis: what do you mean no nodejs
[06:09:25] <Kartagis> zumba_addict: sorry, that was meant for taplar
[06:09:35] <zumba_addict> k
[06:10:21] <zumba_addict> taplar: when you get a chance, please check if you have any thoughts about it. Thanks
[06:10:31] <taplar> Kartagis: sorry, the node.json
[06:11:19] <Kartagis> taplar: node.json is within my endpoint to create a node
[06:11:37] <Kartagis> and as testuser, I should be able to create
[06:11:45] <taplar> right, i was just saying that's the one that is getting the 403
[06:12:00] <Kartagis> but somehow the system doesn't see me as auth'd
[06:15:22] <taplar> zumba_addict: not very familiar with this ajaxPrefilter.  is it a correct assumption that the handler happens before ajax requests happen?
[06:15:48] <zumba_addict> yes, ajaxPrefilter happens always before the the request from what I have noticed
[06:15:59] <taplar> k
[06:16:52] <zumba_addict> i also read the jquery doc and it says that it will finish whatever is in ajaxprefilter before it passes back to success or error
[06:17:28] <zumba_addict> so when I turned off the the ajaxprefilter when type of request is json, my pull request got questioned, lol
[06:17:37] <zumba_addict> jsonp^
[06:18:36] <zumba_addict> they told me that I cannot stop the retry when request is jsonp. Unfortunately since jsonp is a hack, capturing the js exception is happening in the ajaxPrefilter first before it passes to my original ajax jsonp call
[06:19:08] <taplar> ok, so spitballing
[06:19:09] <zumba_addict> when I stopped it from using ajaxFilter, I was able to capture the js exception in the main ajax call insider error callback
[06:19:23] <taplar> would it perhaps only be doing the error callback because of this? if (originalOptions.retryCount >= originalOptions.retryMax) {
[06:19:26] <zumba_addict> what is spitballing? it's first time i heard it
[06:19:49] <taplar> spitballing, brainstorming, etc
[06:19:58] <taplar> just throwing ideas out and seeing what sticks
[06:19:58] <zumba_addict> looking since I really didn't write that code. it was already there when i joined the team
[06:20:00] <taplar> ;)
[06:20:03] <zumba_addict> k
[06:20:30] <zumba_addict> fyi about this options.error = function(_jqXHR, _textStatus, _errorThrown) {
[06:20:42] <taplar> in your pastebin it's line 17
[06:20:48] <zumba_addict> the value of _textStatus and _errorThrown were just string and value is timeout
[06:21:07] <zumba_addict> k
[06:21:24] <zumba_addict> i was thinking of putting the capturing of error inside this code but it will make it ugly
[06:22:14] <zumba_addict> you are right, it will only spit it out after it has reached the max retry
[06:22:44] <taplar> which kinda makes sense.  if it works on try 5/10, why error?
[06:23:00] <zumba_addict> got it
[06:23:32] <zumba_addict> so looking at the code again, it will go to that line if my original ajax call failed
[06:37:54] <placidb> I'm having some trouble understand what is happening here: http://pastebin.com/vN68c9Tc
[06:38:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  still there
[06:38:22] <taplar> yup
[06:38:24] <placidb> shouldn't .index() there match :eq()?
[06:38:26] <hellyeah> actually the thing you saw on the facade of button is value
[06:38:28] <hellyeah> not name
[06:38:33] <hellyeah> name is same
[06:38:38] <taplar> one hand holding a banana so i may be slow
[06:38:50] <hellyeah> sorry i didnt meantion my intension truly
[06:39:16] <hellyeah> all buttons has same name and class value
[06:39:28] <hellyeah> id is different from 0 to ......
[06:39:33] <hellyeah> 0,1,2,3,4,5
[06:39:36] <jphase> placidb: no, .index() returns the index of the selected element in relation to its siblings
[06:39:43] <hellyeah> name is same because of backend concern
[06:39:50] <hellyeah> class is same because of css concern
[06:39:54] <jphase> so there could be a div or element inserted in there somewhere that makes that last one return 5
[06:39:59] <hellyeah> id is different because of js concern
[06:40:20] <hellyeah> so i have name, value , id , class
[06:40:24] <taplar> id has to be different
[06:40:26] <shoftee> Greetings, can someone help me with a weird problem I have?
[06:40:32] <hellyeah> taplar:  yeah i know
[06:40:46] <hihihihihi> shoftee whats the problem?
[06:40:48] <hellyeah> i wrap buttons with for loop and give it to the id of button with .attr()
[06:41:06] <hihihihihi> shoftee from hereforth you will be called softy
[06:41:11] <shoftee> I'm having a very peculiar issue with an .each call, only on iPads, only on one specific site.
[06:41:20] <hellyeah> what
[06:41:20] <hellyeah> hereforth
[06:41:20] <hellyeah> ?
[06:41:31] <taplar> from this point on
[06:41:36] <shoftee> I don't mind being called softy, if that helps you help me.
[06:41:41] <taplar> henceforth
[06:42:15] <shoftee> The .each call does an extra iteration, repeating the first element of a selector result.
[06:42:37] <hihihihihi> what is the site
[06:42:39] <shoftee> Specifically it iterates over all the results as usual, and then at the end does one more iteration of the first element.
[06:42:47] <shoftee> Sorry, can't tell you.
[06:43:38] <shoftee> This only happens on iPads, and only on this specific copy of the site, and only for this specific selector. If I change the selector a bit it works correctly.
[06:44:12] <shoftee> The .length of the jquery object is +1 of what it should be.
[06:44:29] <hihihihihi> it make a duplicate of a specific selector?
[06:44:40] <hihihihihi> like h1 is being spit out twice  or what?
[06:45:36] <shoftee> $someContainer.find('parent1 parent2 child').length returns 10, $someContainer('child').length is 9, .each on the first does 10 iterations, .each on the second does 9.
[06:45:59] <placidb> jphase: thank you.
[06:46:11] <jphase> np
[06:46:23] <placidb> jphase: what would be a better way to get the index of a 'product-item' when I click oni t?
[06:46:24] <placidb> on it *
[06:46:45] <Cork> shoftee: $someContainer('child') isn't even a valid syntax
[06:46:58] <shoftee> Yes, excuse me for not typing it all in correctly.
[06:47:02] <hihihihihi> parent 1 is getting 10 iterations and parent 2 is getting 9 iterations
[06:47:04] <shoftee> I don't have linting in IRC.
[06:47:10] <shoftee> Work with me here.
[06:47:15] <Cork> shoftee: could you make a jsfiddle with a little less psudo code of the problem?
[06:47:34] <shoftee> Alright, I can try.
[06:48:05] <Cork> shoftee: also i'm VERY skeptical in that there is a jquery bug here
[06:48:17] <Cork> but lets have a look when you've created a demo
[06:48:19] <shoftee> I also am skeptical, it's probably a bug in webkit :P
[06:48:23] <shoftee> But not really sure.
[06:48:36] <taplar> i don't have an iPad to test.  you said only an issue on ipad?
[06:48:40] <Cork> shoftee: no i don't think it is the browser or jquery
[06:48:52] <shoftee> Yes, only on iPads.
[06:48:59] <psudocode> cork if its not the browser or jquery then what could it be?
[06:49:14] <taplar> user implementation
[06:49:19] <shoftee> taplar: even if you had an iPad, debugging it is a bitch, took me half a work day.
[06:49:21] <Cork> shoftee: is "child" an input field perhaps?
[06:50:00] <Cork> safari touch devices add extra overlays for those
[06:50:01] <shoftee> No, it's not, actually this is done to an XML string.
[06:50:16] <shoftee> I'm using it to get data out of the XML.
[06:51:45] <jphase> placidb: something similar to how this works:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/gv0ds998/
[06:52:45] <jphase> not sure what your use case is but that's an example of some simple math to make the index "correct" - really depends on your markup though
[06:57:35] <placidb> jphase: thank you. I'm guessing that the clearfixes are causing .index() to give results that I wasn't expecting
[06:57:45] <quantumvoice> shoftee did you make a fiddle?
[06:57:50] <shoftee> Workin' on it.
[06:58:02] <jphase> placidb: sounds about right
[06:58:59] <placidb> your .prevAll() approach is clever
[06:59:56] <shoftee> https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/
[07:00:43] <hellyeah> question
[07:00:54] <shoftee> Yep, this reproduces it on the iPad, even.
[07:01:05] <hellyeah> let say i have 1000 records on table can i select some of them from jquery ?
[07:01:28] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/35/
[07:01:49] <hellyeah> when you click the button you will get this string https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/35/
[07:02:01] <hellyeah> also one of my table has those string in columns
[07:02:23] <hellyeah> can i compare this string with value of column and select appropriate one_
[07:02:24] <hellyeah> ?
[07:02:37] <shoftee> quantumvoice: https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/ reproduces it on the iPad
[07:04:42] <Cork> shoftee: interesting
[07:04:48] <shoftee> quantumvoice: https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/1/ prettier XML
[07:04:54] <Cork> shoftee: have you checked what elements it actually loops?
[07:05:09] <Cork> meaning, what is the extra entry?
[07:05:55] <Cork> console.log($(parsed).find('container items item').map(function() { return this.id; }).get());
[07:06:04] <Cork> that array would be interesting to see
[07:06:23] <shoftee> https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/2/
[07:07:21] <Cork> <-- doesn't have an ipad so a stored response would be nice
[07:07:37] <shoftee> Ugh, is there an easy way to store the response?
[07:07:54] <Cork> just... ouch
[07:07:58] <Cork> ipad heh
[07:08:07] <shoftee> Tell me about it.
[07:08:13] <shoftee> Do you know how much of a pain this is to debug on a Windows box?
[07:08:14] <Cork> one min..
[07:08:24] <shoftee> Apple fuckin' require you to have Mac OS X for everything.
[07:08:37] <shoftee> Hmm it returns 1234567899
[07:09:00] <Cork> shoftee: https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/5/
[07:09:21] <Cork> shoftee: hmm so ya, that definitely sounds like a browser bug
[07:09:27] <Cork> one min let me try another thing
[07:09:39] <shoftee> (same with your update, repeats the last ID)
[07:09:52] <shoftee> However, in my actual case, the repeated element is the first one...
[07:11:34] <Cork> shoftee: https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/6/
[07:11:45] <Cork> does the last test give you 10 too?
[07:12:02] <Cork> (it is what jquery uses in the background)
[07:12:05] <shoftee> No, that's a 9.
[07:12:15] <Cork> iiinteresting....
[07:12:27] <shoftee> So maybe somewhere in the middle?
[07:12:39] <shoftee> jquery does uses a bugged browser feature?
[07:12:47] <shoftee> *what jquery does
[07:12:56] <Cork> shoftee: and https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/7/ ?
[07:13:09] <Cork> shoftee: no that is actually what jquery uses
[07:13:23] <Cork> so if you get more it means the looping in jquery causes this
[07:13:26] <shoftee> That's a '1'
[07:13:51] <Cork> heh... this is intriguing
[07:14:15] <shoftee> That's a 1 on my PC too.
[07:14:20] <Cork> it should be
[07:14:24] <shoftee> Alrigh'.
[07:14:35] <Cork> it was basically the only thing i could suspect could cause the problem
[07:14:37] <Cork> but...
[07:14:45] <shoftee> I can try debugging jQuery?
[07:15:52] <shoftee> does jQuery do something special with objects parsed from XML?
[07:17:14] <Cork> shoftee: and https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/8/ ?
[07:17:25] <Cork> (last line 10 or 9?)
[07:17:38] <shoftee> '10'!
[07:17:42] <Cork> hmm
[07:17:44] <shoftee> '9' on desktop
[07:17:46] <Cork> this is really weird
[07:17:53] <AdamPDotty> 10
[07:17:56] <shoftee> .length property bugging out?
[07:18:00] <Cork> no
[07:18:08] <Cork> it is actually giving you 10 responses
[07:18:09] <shoftee> Sounds pretty fishy to me too...
[07:18:24] <Cork> the problem i'm trying to find is why you get the last element twice
[07:18:31] <AdamPDotty> maybe append is inplemented as "+" under some circumstances?
[07:18:53] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i ask a question last question for today
[07:19:29] <taplar> go for it.  i'm still half observing the room, :)
[07:19:48] <AdamPDotty> or the for loop uses for (var i in ... )
[07:19:49] <hellyeah> thank :=)
[07:19:52] <hellyeah> let say i have 1000 records on table can i select some of them from jquery?  when you click the button you will get this string https://jsfiddle.net/gpuby3mp/35/   also one of my table has those string in columns . Can i compare this string with value of column and select appropriate one?
[07:21:47] <Cork> shoftee: ok, so what ever goes wrong happens in sizzle
[07:22:10] <Cork> the function is fairly short, it would recommend digging down into what happens there and file a bug
[07:22:25] <shoftee> Hmmmmm.
[07:22:38] <shoftee> I'll debug that then, see what happens in my real case...
[07:22:59] <taplar> hellyeah: what's the identifier on your columns?
[07:23:01] <shoftee> Thanks for your help.
[07:23:12] <Cork> shoftee: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/src/sizzle.js#L193
[07:23:31] <Cork> hmm wrong branch
[07:23:39] <hellyeah> project_name, environment and frontend
[07:23:49] <hellyeah> may be i need to change the design a bit
[07:23:56] <Cork> shoftee: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/1.11.1/src/sizzle.js#L184
[07:24:01] <hellyeah> i just wonder selecting thing is possible in client side
[07:24:20] <shoftee> Btw, that jsfiddle was on jquery 1.8.3, I should probably try it on 1.11.1
[07:24:35] <Cork> shoftee: ya, good idea
[07:24:40] <hellyeah> you concern about ie
[07:24:42] <hellyeah> ?
[07:25:06] <Cork> shoftee: anyway thx for a very interesting case :)
[07:25:08] <taplar> so your value is project|env|front end?
[07:25:15] <Cork> i wish i had so i could debug it ^^
[07:25:18] <shoftee> Will come back and tell you the result anyway ;P
[07:25:26] <Cork> shoftee: thx
[07:25:29] <taplar> and on your column you have that as well?
[07:26:45] <hellyeah> my table has project_name and environment and row of that columns have values like ECourse, Prod or SearchEngine, Prod
[07:27:09] <hellyeah> i can traverse table and check for the row whatever it matched or not
[07:27:09] <shoftee> Cork: waait, on jQuery 1.11.0 (there was no 1.11.1 in the default list on jsfiddle), the last line is 9.
[07:27:17] <shoftee> https://jsfiddle.net/nhr6ox4s/10/
[07:27:19] <hellyeah> then if it match i can get thos rows
[07:27:20] <hellyeah> etc.
[07:27:29] <Cork> shoftee: and the other?
[07:27:40] <AdamPDotty> the first too
[07:27:46] <shoftee> Oh, the map also returns 9 elements!
[07:27:47] <Cork> so it is fixed in newer versions
[07:27:51] <taplar> hellyeah: can you show me an example of one of these tables and a row?
[07:27:52] <shoftee> Niiiiice.
[07:27:54] <Cork> time to update then :)
[07:27:58] <taplar> having trouble visualizing
[07:28:02] <shoftee> Yeah... see, funny story.
[07:28:14] <shoftee> We use 1.8.3 for the normal part of my site...
[07:28:15] <hellyeah> jus a sec
[07:28:17] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:28:25] <Cork> shoftee: so?
[07:28:29] <Cork> just update it
[07:28:51] <shoftee> Except this part involves HTML5 canvas and animations, and so we don't support older browsers anyway.
[07:29:03] <shoftee> But we used the older jQuery to avoid using 2 separate versions.
[07:29:10] <Cork> 1.10 doens't drop support for older browsers
[07:29:12] <shoftee> (and avoid updating)
[07:29:16] <shoftee> Yeah, I know!
[07:29:28] <morfin> can't remember is (function( $ ) { })(jQuery) same as $(document).ready(function(){})
[07:29:37] <Cork> morfin: no it isn't
[07:29:42] <Cork> $(function() {}) is
[07:29:47] <morfin> ah
[07:29:56] <dimi1947> I have three input fields....and want 2 of the are filled I want the 3rd one to become disabled and vice versa and I am stuck in figuring out the correct conditional to find it...https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/
[07:30:04] <Cork> morfin: (function() {})() is just a self executing function
[07:30:14] <Cork> no effect on when the code executes
[07:30:17] <morfin> isolated...
[07:30:21] <shoftee> Cork: you know where I can find an update guide from 1.8.3 to 1.11.1 ?
[07:30:48] <Cork> shoftee: download and include the jquery-migrate.js
[07:30:59] <Cork> shoftee: it will make 1.9+ compatible with older versions
[07:31:06] <shoftee> Ah, alright.
[07:31:14] <Cork> and it will console log compatibilit calls (unless you disable that)
[07:31:29] <shoftee> Do I have to update jQuery UI as well?
[07:31:42] <Cork> possibly
[07:31:46] <Cork> depends on what version you use
[07:31:53] <Cork> but normally it should work
[07:32:21] <Cork> if you include the migrate lib, even ui versions that doesn't work should work fuine
[07:32:22] <Cork> *fine
[07:32:31] <Cork> as the missing functions gets added with that lib
[07:32:44] <taplar> dimi1947: it looks like you have what your saying your wanting.  if you enter something for the first two, the third disables.  if you enter something for the third, the first two disable
[07:34:11] <shoftee> Cork: thanks. I'm fairly sure I don't actually need to worry about the update, I don't think I'm using any deprecated APIs anyway...
[07:34:29] <dimi1947> taplar: are you sure you saw this one https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/16/ ?
[07:34:32] <Cork> shoftee: $.browser is quite common in older plugins
[07:34:41] <Cork> and $.live too
[07:35:05] <dimi1947> cause I type in the name field and the coname input does not get disabled
[07:35:15] <taplar> ok, that's not what you said
[07:35:26] <taplar> you want the third to disable if either the first two are not blank
[07:35:55] <taplar> if (firstNotBlank || secondNotBlank) { disableThird }
[07:36:28] <dimi1947> yes..that is what I want...but now this does not apply
[07:36:50] <taplar> hmm?
[07:36:54] <dimi1947> cause I type in the name field and the coname input does not get disabled
[07:37:06] <taplar> to your existing fiddle?
[07:37:19] <dimi1947> yes...if possible
[07:37:28] <taplar> right, you'll have to change it to do the above logic
[07:37:28] <morfin> i am thinking how can i do next thing: i want extend datepicker only for specific elements
[07:38:02] <dimi1947> the aim is that the user fills either name/lastname either company name
[07:38:26] <taplar> yup
[07:38:49] <dimi1947> give me a seconde to try something...
[07:39:06] <hellyeah> taplar:  i will show you tomorrow but thanks
[07:39:11] <taplar> hellyeah: k
[07:40:31] <cssNoOB> ..
[07:41:11] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/  this is better but there is a small issue...if name and lastname are filled and the user empties lastname or name company name becomes enabled again
[07:41:52] <taplar> dimi1947: your making your decision based off of only one element
[07:42:01] <taplar> but your logic your describing is dependent on two elements
[07:42:05] <taplar> you have to consider both
[07:42:13] <dimi1947> I am trying...
[07:42:51] <dimi1947> I understand what are you talking about...I will try to fix it
[07:51:24] <dimi1947> taplar,...I got it
[07:51:36] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/bvnpgtsn/
[07:52:00] <taplar> :)
[07:52:07] <dimi1947> it would be better of course if all this check could be accomplished with jquery validate
[07:52:44] <dimi1947> I thought the form_group method could handle this
[07:53:27] <morfin> why can $.fn[pluginName] = function ( options ) { } does not work?
[07:54:55] <ceramicskull> is ValidateControl(); a jquery function or is that ASP.NET?
[07:55:42] <taplar> dimi1947: btw, this could be a little better
[07:56:24] <dimi1947> which is a little better...my code?
[07:56:36] <morfin> nvm it works i did not see that
[07:58:13] <morfin> should i store data related to specific element in .data()?
[07:58:29] <dimi1947> I have any question about jquery validate...in what cases it is triggered besides clicking the submit button?
[07:59:35] <dimi1947> sometimes I have the impression the deleting the content of an input box triggers the validation
[07:59:55] <dimi1947> ...by pressing the backspace repeadetly
[08:01:10] <dimi1947> But I cannot find when exactly this happens...at which precise conditions
[08:01:20] <taplar> sorry, got distracted
[08:01:51] <taplar> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/bvnpgtsn/25/ <-- updated the first one
[08:02:59] <dimi1947> taplar,...what is the difference of your code with mine?
[08:03:20] <taplar> the first block is using cached references to the elements instead of looking them up every time
[08:03:46] <dimi1947> ok....thanks....did you see my last question?
[08:03:58] <dimi1947> about validation triggering...
[08:04:16] <taplar> yeah, not sure about that.
[08:06:44] <dimi1947> taplar, have you ever encountered it?
[08:07:47] <taplar> no, but my history with the validate plugin is almost zero
[08:09:06] <dimi1947> taplar, I suppose that means you cannot help me a lot with this issue...
[08:09:41] <taplar> i'm not confident that I could, :)
[08:13:01] <ceramicskull> dimi1947: do you have your validate plugin set up to trigger onsubmit? From my knowledge, I've had times where it's triggered before the submit cause we're trying to validate all the info before submission.
[08:15:26] <dimi1947> ceramicskull, how am I going to set up the plugin to trigger onsubmit?
[08:15:59] <dimi1947> the code I use every time is this https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/avmsaev6/
[08:18:44] <ceramicskull> Well it currently validates onsubmit, but to answer your question, I've never had it validate on backspaces :l
[08:19:12] <dimi1947> ok...look what happens....
[08:19:30] <dimi1947> and in relation to the fiddle I gave you
[08:19:48] <YamakasY> I have some reponse message which is json but I wonder how I can print html in it
[08:20:40] <dimi1947> the problem appears AFTER I click the submit button....if then I type sonething and then empty the input box....validation is triggered
[08:21:09] <dimi1947> try it in the fiddle I gave you...
[08:21:19] <YamakasY> or is it impossible ?
[08:21:56] <taplar> YamakasY: your wanting to include html in your json response?
[08:22:16] <YamakasY> taplar: yap
[08:22:19] <YamakasY> or is that odd ?
[08:22:36] <jonez> greetings. I need some help with a $.ajax() call that for some reason is not firing the "done" or even the "always" event
[08:23:06] <jonez> I know the request is made because I see it on the js console. the url is correct.
[08:23:22] <taplar> YamakasY: don't see why you couldn't do that
[08:24:14] <YamakasY> taplar: I get all printed :S
[08:24:47] <taplar> what do you mean?
[08:27:58] <YamakasY> taplar: I now see <i> </i> printed
[08:29:10] <taplar> what are you returning?
[08:29:53] <YamakasY> taplar: that :)
[08:30:04] <taplar> oh, so it's good?
[08:40:04] <YamakasY> taplar: no, I parse <i> and it's printed as <i>
[08:41:10] <taplar> got a fiddle with your js?
[08:43:00] <YamakasY> taplar: nope, but I found something else :)
[09:10:19] <shoftee> Cork: Yep, upgrading the version of jQuery fixed the problem in my prod environment.
[09:10:26] <shoftee> Thanks for your help very much!
[09:19:25] <dimi1947> go to this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/jvb2mr1o/4/ click the submit button...some messages appear....I want to target the messages that appear besides the name and lastname fields
[09:20:02] <robertmaxrees> then target them?
[09:20:11] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for the selectors to use?
[09:20:36] <dimi1947> I just noticed something....
[09:21:16] <dimi1947> in the fiddle they have an Id...locally only a class...and THAT makes them difficult to target...
[09:21:33] <dimi1947> I want to target only the specific ones
[09:22:12] <dimi1947> I am saying that cause there other messages to with the same class(locally)....but I want to target only these ttw
[09:22:15] <dimi1947> two
[09:22:31] <robertmaxrees> then target them by ID?
[09:22:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused about what the issue is.
[09:23:11] <dimi1947> yes I understand why you are confused...
[09:23:35] <dimi1947> the problem is that I use an older version locally....I have to update then see what to do
[09:27:14] <ashka> hi, can I cancel a form submission with the enter key if the enter key was pressed "in" a certain field ? (basically I want the form to submit normally if it is pressed in any field but in this one I need to process extra data)
[09:28:41] <jrockjiggz> hi, i'm trying to select (nth) sibling looking forward.. kind of $('tr').next(3) //if only next allowed n
[09:30:35] <taplar> ashka: you could probably bind on that input field for keydown or keypress and check if the key was enter and proceed from there
[09:37:12] <ashka> taplar: thanks, I'll use that
[09:42:45] <jrockjiggz> so I have a TD, trying to select it's parent and N siblings.. hmmm
[09:43:25] <jrockjiggz> in a counted loop... var group = $('td').parent(); group.add(group.nextAll().eq(n)); doesnt work
[09:43:49] <jrockjiggz> nextAll isn't selecting all TRs
[09:44:03] <taplar> $('td').parent().siblings() ?
[09:44:31] <jrockjiggz> siblings eh
[09:45:16] <Finland> hello, is there a way to make all text inputs with a specific class have a specified value?
[09:45:20] <Finland> this was my attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/nk9240h5/1/
[09:45:28] <Finland> but it obviously didn't work as expected
[09:46:08] <taplar> your trying to set the value before you create it
[09:46:13] <Finland> yes
[09:46:18] <Finland> is it possible?
[09:46:20] <taplar> can't do that
[09:46:25] <Finland> :(
[09:46:29] <taplar> you'll have to set it after you create it
[09:46:35] <taplar> or at the time of creation
[09:46:52] <taplar> one sec
[09:48:36] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/nk9240h5/2/
[09:49:29] <taplar> err, actually that one thing should be in the ready
[09:49:45] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/nk9240h5/3/
[09:51:40] <Finland> well, thanks, but that isn't what I was looking for
[09:52:03] <taplar> what are you looking for?
[09:52:11] <Finland> the problem is, the value shouldn't be the same each time you create a new text input
[09:52:22] <Finland> basically, I have an iframe and a popover
[09:52:31] <Finland> inside that popover, there is a text input
[09:52:48] <Finland> I want that text input to have the src of the iframe
[09:53:06] <taplar> the url?
[09:53:21] <Finland> yeah
[09:53:33] <Finland> the src attribute of the iframe is the url
[09:53:35] <taplar> oh, well then just look it up and use that instead of defaultValue
[09:53:40] <Finland> well, the value of it
[09:53:55] <Finland> hmm
[09:54:08] <Finland> hang on, I will try that
[09:57:08] <fas3r> Hello

[09:59:50] <fas3r> I can apply .hide() on the other div, but is there any function to search text ?

[10:10:39] <Finland> taplar_food: I got it working :D
[10:10:40] <Finland> thanks
[10:10:47] <taplar_food> cool
[10:11:48] <jak2000> hi all
[10:13:19] <taplar_food> crisumi: as an option you might consider using the table-cell display.  http://jsfiddle.net/3cm0sccb/
[10:18:11] <jak2000> anyeon can try help me: Hi all i want create a Wizard same as: http://www.jquery-steps.com/Examples#basic i try create here in my webpage: http://frigorificos.noip.me:8080/jinvmanz2/ejemplo1.jsp  i checked and checked what happend and not found the error. The path of the files its ok Any avice, how to create a Wizard?   Thanks
[10:21:01] <jak2000> taplar_food?
[10:21:21] <taplar_food> not a big fan of wizards.  don't ask me, :P
[10:21:30] <jak2000> why not?
[10:21:52] <taplar_food> mmm, just stupid crap our users requested we modify it to do
[10:22:14] <taplar_food> i came in on the tail end of it, but apparently it got redonkulous
[10:22:27] <jak2000> i need create a wizard report for Dummy ppl understand me?
[10:29:10] <taplar_food> which file has your steps logic in it?
[10:30:33] <jak2000> taplar_food: <script src="js/jspallrepwiz.js"></script>    ?
[10:33:34] <taplar_food> oh
[10:33:47] <taplar_food> you have your logic in your head, but you do not have it inside a document ready
[10:33:54] <taplar_food> so it's probably happening before you body is ready
[10:34:19] <jak2000> ok understand
[10:34:52] <Finland> hello, I've encountered another problem :/
[10:34:53] <Finland> http://jsfiddle.net/s693bodf/
[10:35:22] <taplar_food> .location is a dom element
[10:36:29] <jak2000> taplar_food: done :)
[10:36:39] <jak2000> you are right
[10:36:40] <Finland> well
[10:36:45] <Finland> that is what I got when I googled it
[10:36:59] <Finland> I've also tried other methods which didn't work either
[10:37:07] <taplar_food> $("#iframe").prop('src')
[10:37:57] <jak2000> taplar
[10:38:12] <jak2000> explain me how to 'detect' the error
[10:38:13] <Finland> I don't want the src
[10:38:17] <jak2000> i am use chrome, canyou?
[10:38:27] <Finland> the src doesn't change when you click on a link inside the iframe
[10:38:40] <taplar> mmm
[10:38:59] <Finland> I know I was talking about using the src to get the url, but I guess I was wrong :P
[10:39:38] <taplar> gah, i forget my iframe accessors
[10:43:09] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/s693bodf/1/
[10:43:27] <taplar> tried to .href off of that but gave me a security error, but it's a start
[10:44:13] <taplar> jak2000: what error you trying to detect?
[10:44:20] <Finland> well
[10:44:31] <Finland> I don't know why that error is popping up
[10:44:35] <Finland> I mean, nothing looks wrong
[10:44:40] <jak2000> taplar document ready
[10:44:41] <elpo1> jQuery last-child selector w/ conditional statements problem, please help: http://jsbin.com/paxotapixe/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[10:45:12] <taplar> jak2000: ah.  ok.  so script put in the head will typically load first
[10:45:25] <taplar> that means before the body is ready to be referenced
[10:45:38] <taplar> so any logic you try to do in there that references body element will fail as they don't exist yet
[10:45:57] <taplar> to counter act this, you either put your script tags at the bottom so they execute after the body has been rendered
[10:46:16] <taplar> or you surround your logic with document ready, which prevents the logic from executing until the resources have been loaded
[10:48:30] <taplar> elpo1: i'm assuming your k logic you want to happen for each ul?
[10:48:41] <elpo1> taplar: exactly
[10:48:55] <taplar> you'll probably have to do an each() on it
[10:49:01] <elpo1> taplar: oh
[10:49:32] <taplar> your k contains multiple elements
[10:49:38] <taplar> elements.html() doesn't really make sense
[10:49:57] <elpo1> taplar: oh right, what would that look like in this context?
[10:50:40] <taplar> k.each(function(){ var $oneK = $(this); /* do stuff with $oneK */ })
[10:52:39] <zumba_addict> good afternoon folks
[10:53:57] <claytonzaugg> what would cause <video autoplay> to not autoplay? I still have to right click and choose "play"
[10:56:59] <zumba_addict> after looking at the whole project, our app is using jsonp 15 times. On one of the jsonp js exception issues, I figured out how to fix "callback is not a function" by adding this code( http://pastebin.com/DJ7DBz1x ) in error: on my local $.ajax call. I am thinking that if I add it in all other error:, code is inefficient or duplicate
[10:57:10] <zumba_addict> how can I centralize it?
[11:01:45] <taplar> zumba_addict: so you have a callback that removes itself?
[11:02:43] <taplar> i'm forgetting users, but is this related to the ajax prefilter or whatever earlier?
[11:05:07] <jak2000> taplar thanks
[11:05:11] <jak2000> for the explanation
[11:05:18] <taplar> np, make sense?
[11:08:20] <jak2000> yes
[11:08:47] <jak2000> i understand too... if i write the <script> </script> code at the end of the file it would work right?
[11:09:45] <taplar> yes, putting the script include or in page script at the bottom will cause it not to be parsed by the browser until the previous body html has been
[11:09:49] <zumba_addict> just got back taplar
[11:10:28] <zumba_addict> taplar: i was able to fix the ajax prefilter issue. This question is a different one. I just wanted to centralize it
[11:10:46] <zumba_addict> in AngularJS, they have this thing called http interceptor
[11:11:40] <tgodar> anyone been doing jsonp for awhile?  Have some code I need to make work under 1.8.3 and not understanding where the damn JSON payload is in the object returned
[11:12:33] <tgodar> grr.  success vs complete...
[11:12:35] <tgodar> nvm
[11:39:30] <jak2000> taplar accept a pm?
[11:39:36] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel yo.
[11:39:43] <robertmaxrees> defeats the purpose of the room otherwise :)
[11:40:15] <jak2000> robertmaxrees is a large history, and not want spam the channel
[11:40:29] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:40:55] <robertmaxrees> if it's got a big backstory, your question is too broad.  boil it down :)
[11:41:12] <jak2000> ok i try explain with steps:
[11:41:33] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[11:41:36] <robertmaxrees> that's almost worse.
[11:41:49] <jak2000> 1) http://postimg.org/image/5otkl2tbz/   in #1, i get the data from a table and create 4 buttons (if user have 10 records(type of fruit), then create 10 buttons, right?
[11:42:13] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:42:26] <jak2000> not know how to extract from database
[11:42:28] <jak2000> in a fiddle
[11:42:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[11:42:37] <robertmaxrees> give rendered html.
[11:42:43] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't care about your DB.
[11:43:23] <jak2000> ok
[11:44:28] * jak2000 creating a fiddle
[12:14:36] <teamcoltra> Hey everyone, I am looking to do an infinit scroll solution and I am running into a conceptual problem: my posts are mostly the size of tweets so I want to load about 10 at a time... and I have that part taken care of but I haven't found any solutions that "fill" the page. For instance on my browser I am going to need to start with 10 and add another 10 but on a smaller mobile device I might only need 3 or so each time but I want it to dynamically
[12:14:36] <teamcoltra>  add only enough posts to make it to the bottom
[12:14:59] <teamcoltra> I guess I can try to do it by scratch, but I was wondering if anyone knew of a solution already in the wild
[12:15:31] <robertmaxrees> "make it to the bottom"?
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> why not load before the user gets there.?
[12:17:15] <jak2000> how to create a biimensional array?  i try: var list = {["CHAR"][65], ["CHAR"]["80"],["CHAR"]["88"],["GRAN"]["1a"],["GRAN"]["3a"]; but not work
[12:17:28] <taplar> a 2d array?
[12:17:34] <robertmaxrees> [[],[]];
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> use [] instead of {} for the outer array.
[12:18:45] <robertmaxrees> also need to wrap each "group" in a set of [];
[12:18:55] <robertmaxrees> though that's a really inefficient data structure.
[12:19:46] <jak2000> ok
[12:19:59] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[12:20:08] <jak2000> why? i want simulate my table..
[12:20:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:20:21] <taplar> teamcoltra: your design idea seems strange to me.  i understand the desire to fit as many posts in the viewport without exceeding the vertical space, but then how would you proceed?  seems more like your wanting a paging solution
[12:20:33] <robertmaxrees> this is taking a really long time, jak2000 just copy the html or create a simplified example./
[12:20:47] <teamcoltra> robertmaxrees sure but I don't want to load too much either, but I think I have figured it out... maybe a bit "dumber" but I will just load X number if screen size is > x and load Y number if screen size is < x
[12:20:54] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[12:21:04] <robertmaxrees> teamcoltra you should start loading before the user has hit the bottom of the page.
[12:21:22] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10419781  i want do something
[12:21:29] <teamcoltra> robertmaxrees sure... but that doesn't change how much content I want to first serve up and how much content each time they should get
[12:21:34] <robertmaxrees> do like 10 at a time.
[12:21:48] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 huh?
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 do you have html to share or...?
[12:22:17] <teamcoltra> and if 10 doesn't fill? That's what I am trying to figure out in the first place... how to know if it needs more content
[12:22:52] <robertmaxrees> then have your first page default with a higher number.  feel free to get weird with it, just seems strange to spend a bunch of extra time on it.
[12:24:00] <robertmaxrees> hell, twitter loads like 21 on pageload.
[12:26:36] <zumba_addict> i documented it which helped me explain it better - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32572415/centralize-capturing-of-errors-in-jquery
[12:27:20] <robertmaxrees> does .fail() not work?
[12:27:57] <robertmaxrees> and why are you making jsonp calls without defining the callback first?
[12:44:21] <zumba_addict> folks, i'm reading this link but just wondering why it is not recommended for use - https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/
[12:44:34] <robertmaxrees> why did you ignore my earlier questions?
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> also, that page explains why it's discouraged to use it.
[12:45:33] <zumba_addict> oh, i'm so sorry. I didn't see it
[12:45:47] <zumba_addict> its because someone came over to my desk
[12:45:51] <zumba_addict> looking at it now
[12:45:51] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> just curious.
[12:46:52] <zumba_addict> we are using backbone's fetch which actually use jquery
[12:46:57] <zumba_addict> i can try using .fail
[12:47:20] <zumba_addict> what do you mean by this? robertmaxrees: and why are you making jsonp calls without defining the callback first?
[12:47:28] <robertmaxrees> JSONP requires a callback.
[12:47:32] <robertmaxrees> so why aren't you defining one?
[12:48:14] <zumba_addict> oh, I do. The code I posted is an extracted version
[12:48:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:48:33] <claytonzaugg> regarding the <video> tag, what could cause autoplay to not work, but loop would?
[12:50:03] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg are you on a mobile device?
[12:50:12] <claytonzaugg> I am not
[12:50:34] <robertmaxrees> also: it's a boolean attribute, so you should just have autoplay, not autoplay="true"
[12:50:44] <claytonzaugg> <video id="bgVideo" autoplay name="doorbellcam" loop>
[12:50:58] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[12:51:08] <claytonzaugg> chrome, it's a webm file
[12:51:21] <notchris> How do I referenced "formatted address"
[12:51:23] <notchris> http://puu.sh/kbkVm/f06a8d75f6.png
[12:51:27] <zumba_addict> backbonejs allows us to fill out properties like jsonpCallback = 'theCallbackFunctionNameILike' + microTime; This gets passed to jquery ajax
[12:51:33] <robertmaxrees> notchris wut
[12:51:42] <claytonzaugg> works with firefox though
[12:51:46] <robertmaxrees> notchris uh, .formatte_address
[12:51:56] <robertmaxrees> err .formatted_address
[12:51:57] <notchris> Object.formatted_address
[12:52:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[12:52:02] <notchris> ?
[12:52:08] <notchris> Literally "Object"
[12:52:09] <notchris> ?
[12:52:11] <robertmaxrees> if it's a property of that object.
[12:52:14] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:52:20] <notchris> What is the object name?
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> what's the name of the object?
[12:52:25] <notchris> I'm not sure
[12:52:25] <robertmaxrees> dunno from that.
[12:52:36] <robertmaxrees> how are you logging that out?
[12:52:50] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg sounds like a chrome bug.
[12:53:13] <notchris> It's from a script
[12:53:18] <notchris> console.log(result);
[12:53:23] <notchris> result is the variable
[12:53:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:53:28] <notchris> And it outputs that object
[12:53:31] <robertmaxrees> then it's result.formatted_address
[12:53:35] <zumba_addict> did you see my message above robertmaxrees?
[12:53:46] <jak2016> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/8me5apjo/14/   how to create the buttons with the array: list ?
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict yep, no idea what that has to do with anything.
[12:54:19] <robertmaxrees> jak2016 uh, does this involve your question from earlier?
[12:54:35] <notchris> robertmaxrees: It works!
[12:54:36] <notchris> Woo
[12:54:37] <notchris> <3
[12:54:47] <zumba_addict> so yup, all i wanted to do is find out if jquery will allow us to centralize capturing of ajax errors
[12:55:04] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict in that case, it's possible, but discouraged.
[12:55:10] <robertmaxrees> you should abstract out things instead.
[12:55:19] <zumba_addict> k
[12:55:37] <zumba_addict> any ideas why it's discouraged?
[12:55:51] <robertmaxrees> it explains exactly why in the documentation >.>
[12:56:06] <zumba_addict> cool, i read it now
[12:56:08] <zumba_addict> thanks
[12:56:35] <robertmaxrees> "Note: The settings specified here will affect all calls to $.ajax or Ajax-based derivatives such as $.get(). This can cause undesirable behavior since other callers (for example, plugins) may be expecting the normal default settings. For that reason we strongly recommend against using this API. Instead, set the options explicitly in the call or define a simple plugin to do so."
[12:59:20] <zumba_addict> btw, i'm trying to figure out which code is updating the dom. Is it possible to configure chrome dev tools to monitor the dom so if in case it sees part of a page changes like status, chrome dev tools will bring us to the code kinda like a breakpoint
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> there are DOM breakpoints available.
[13:05:54] <zumba_addict> trial .fail robertmaxrees, didn't work
[13:19:04] <plamble> trying to test this jquery but getting some weird fiddle error
[13:19:10] <plamble> any way to fix this?
[13:19:11] <plamble> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/ka0dvma3/2/
[13:19:32] <jphase> plamble: start by adding jQuery to the fiddle on the left
[13:20:20] <plamble> roger
[13:20:23] <plamble> still getting that POST error
[13:21:38] <jphase> plamble: I'm not sure what you're expecting to happen here, but you're binding a click event to a submit button on a form - that submit button will naturally submit the form unless you tell it to prevent its default action on click
[13:22:07] <plamble> is there an easy way to do that so i can test the jquery's behavior
[13:22:15] <plamble> i realize this might not be the right channel
[13:39:19] <plamble> alright now its legitimately a jquery issue
[13:39:32] <plamble> im trying to implement this behavior
[13:39:37] <plamble> http://jsfiddle.net/satpalsingh/4yE2R/1/
[13:39:45] <plamble> but its not working
[13:39:45] <plamble> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/ka0dvma3/3/
[13:44:19] <robertmaxrees> <li class=".item">
[13:44:24] <robertmaxrees> .item is not a classname.
[13:44:25] <robertmaxrees> item is.
[13:44:32] <plamble> haha
[13:44:41] <plamble> man
[13:44:45] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:45:23] <plamble> is there an easy way to implement like a slow slideup behavior when you .hide()
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/hide/#hide-options
[13:46:08] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, use .slideUp()
[13:46:17] <plamble> instead of hide?
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:47:47] <plamble> nice
[13:49:12] <hannes3> hey, can i use https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ with ~8000 strings (~100 kilobytes) without making my users hate me or freezing browsers?
[13:49:22] <robertmaxrees> D:
[13:49:30] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[13:49:43] <robertmaxrees> though i'd strongly suggest using some ajax instead.
[13:49:51] <hannes3> :D
[13:49:59] <hannes3> it's for some silly sideproject
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> you could give it a shot - i'd handroll it if it doesn't perform very well.
[13:53:00] <hannes3> just realised that HTML5 has <datalist>
[13:58:13] <hannes3> works great just like that
[13:58:13] <hannes3> :)
[13:58:27] <ovnicraft> hi, i am working with a html file its load data from xml file with:   $(document).data("xmlName","actividad.xml"); i know this is not a good practice, so i want to know how i can replace it ?
[13:58:32] <claytonzaugg> Regarding the <video> tag, does it load ALL video files or just the one you have listed that the browser can use?
[13:59:19] <ovnicraft> si i dont know with manage this, i never see it before
[13:59:23] <ovnicraft> so*
[13:59:45] <robertmaxrees> ovnicraft totally depends - are you trying to parse the xml?
[14:37:45] <ovnicraft> robertmaxrees, i want to avoid xml
[14:38:00] <robertmaxrees> then... do't use it?
[14:38:22] <robertmaxrees> *don't
[14:38:51] <ovnicraft> so i need content, i want to know if i can define that data in json, inside of html
[14:41:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a server-side deal.
[14:41:50] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to send it from the server that way.
[14:43:46] <ovnicraft> yes i can send from server, so i have a new Q: i use .data() again ?
[14:43:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:43:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you used it in the first palce.
[14:43:59] <robertmaxrees> *place
[14:44:15] <robertmaxrees> depending on how much of this you'll be doing, I'd check out using a frontend templating setup.
[14:44:42] <ovnicraft> so i download it from internet, its part of a html5 component ( resource learning)
[14:44:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:46:05] <ovnicraft> i download a zip with a game, i read the html and look .data(xmlname) but i want to change it to use it properly in mydjango app, but i dont know how to replace data("xmlName", "xmlfile.xml")
[14:46:21] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense.
[14:46:27] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to integrate something with your site?
[14:46:32] <ovnicraft> yes
[14:46:49] <ovnicraft> i can share you all content
[14:46:49] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to update the reference to xmlfile.xml
[14:47:03] <robertmaxrees> unless you rewrite major portions of the game.
[14:47:35] <ovnicraft> update or replace
[14:48:04] <ovnicraft> but in terms of document, what does data("xmlName", "file.xml") ?
[14:48:06] <robertmaxrees> not sure how those are contextually distinct in this case >.>
[14:48:33] <ovnicraft> instance some vars ? create new nodes in document ?
[14:48:37] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[14:48:51] <robertmaxrees> sets data-xmlName="file.xml"
[14:48:56] <robertmaxrees> that's all that is doing.
[14:49:31] <ovnicraft> i see this in docs: $( "body" ).data( "bar", { myType: "test", count: 40 } );
[14:49:39] <ovnicraft> it means i can replace with a json ?
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> you can also do that, yes.
[14:49:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:49:50] <robertmaxrees> because the game is likely written to use XML.
[14:50:06] <robertmaxrees> so unless you replace all of that code, you cannot simply "replace with a json"
[14:50:33] <ovnicraft> ok, i will give a try and looking for references to xml file
[14:50:48] <robertmaxrees> hold up.
[14:50:54] <robertmaxrees> did this come with instructions or something?
[14:50:56] <ovnicraft> thank you
[14:51:01] <ovnicraft> nope

[14:51:06] <ovnicraft> just a zip
[14:51:08] <SpecialTechnique> So I to check if URL parameter does not exist {do something}. I was referring to this link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4597050/how-to-check-if-the-url-contains-a-given-string, but this is only gives me if url parameter exist {do something}
[14:51:34] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTechnique so then negate the check
[14:52:06] <robertmaxrees> indexOf() returns -1 if something isn't found in a string.
[14:53:34] <SpecialTechnique> so then like if (window.location.href.indexOf("param") == -1){ do something } ?
[14:53:50] <robertmaxrees> use === , not == , but yeah.
[14:53:51] <robertmaxrees> though that
[14:53:59] <robertmaxrees> *that's kind of a lazy check.
[14:54:09] <robertmaxrees> because that string could be parameter or a value.
[14:54:20] <SpecialTechnique> hmmm
[14:54:23] <robertmaxrees> but depending on your case it should be good enough.
[14:55:23] <SpecialTechnique> what would be a more proper way? As all the URL's i've seen pretty much use indexOf()
[14:55:58] <robertmaxrees> regex or parse out the URL into an object and go from there.
[15:07:10] <Deltaheavy> Anybody know why this form isn't submitting? I have the function it's calling here - https://www.refheap.com/109532         This is the event handler this.$form.on('submit', this.submit.bind(this));
[15:07:54] <robertmaxrees> try using .prop() instead of attr()
[15:10:07] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: Not working - this.$form.prop('action', this.queryString.replace('#qbox#', encodeURIComponent(query)));
[15:10:54] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[15:11:10] <Deltaheavy> Nope
[15:11:19] <robertmaxrees> i'd need a fiddle or something then.
[15:11:39] <Deltaheavy> That's going to be hard. It's querying an external server before I can reach that point.
[15:11:52] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: This is the whole thing - https://www.refheap.com/3ee041b44ca4547f08dd763df
[15:12:06] <robertmaxrees> i need literally just the markup and js related to this particular part.
[15:13:17] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/n391L5ek/
[15:16:48] <robertmaxrees> you mean more like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n391L5ek/1/ ?
[15:17:06] <robertmaxrees> what is this.$query?
[15:18:23] <robertmaxrees> seems to work fine here.
[15:18:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/n391L5ek/2/
[15:20:45] <SpecialTechnique> hey robertmaxrees it worked, thanks!
[15:21:07] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: Still not working for me. I'm going to take a 5min breka.
[15:21:17] <robertmaxrees> Deltaheavy it works in the fiddle /shrug
[15:21:41] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: Yeah, I must be overlooking something
[15:21:46] <Deltaheavy> Need to clear my mind for a minute I think
[15:37:00] <jak2000> how to add other item to a list: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/8me5apjo/15/   see line 19, thanks
[15:37:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:37:18] <robertmaxrees> what list?
[15:37:26] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:37:30] <robertmaxrees> you want to push an object.
[15:38:16] <robertmaxrees> since .push takes a single arg. wrap that with {}
[15:38:23] <jak2000> yes
[15:38:24] <jak2000> done
[15:38:27] <jak2000> thanks
[15:39:45] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: This doesn't work though - http://jsfiddle.net/n391L5ek/3/
[15:40:20] <Deltaheavy> I mean this - http://jsfiddle.net/n391L5ek/4/
[15:41:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean in the fiddle?
[15:41:10] <Deltaheavy> Yeah
[15:41:14] <robertmaxrees> console :)
[15:41:22] <robertmaxrees> this.$query isn't a thing.
[15:41:41] <Deltaheavy> True
[15:41:51] <Deltaheavy> Why won't this work then? http://jsfiddle.net/n391L5ek/5/
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:42:25] <Deltaheavy> Wait think I found it
[15:42:26] <robertmaxrees> like, why doesn't it work on pageload?
[15:43:36] <Deltaheavy> robertmaxrees: Issue was having name="submit" on my submit input
[15:44:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:20:16] <fas3r> Hello
[16:20:52] <fas3r> How can I call .append without putting selector in the front ?
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> what are you appending to then?
[16:28:34] <fas3r> basically I return HTML containt from AJAX and I would like to use insertAfter  so I'm wondering how to change ".html(data)" as "selector let say... like : $.html(data).insertAfter($("#specrow"));
[16:28:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[16:29:26] <robertmaxrees> $(data).appendTo('#specrow');
[16:29:52] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: I don't need to use html to render it ?
[16:30:01] <fas3r> if you see what I mean.
[16:30:03] <robertmaxrees> probably not, no.
[16:30:09] <robertmaxrees> is it a string?
[16:30:32] <fas3r> yes HTML string..
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> then just do $() around the data
[16:30:40] <robertmaxrees> done and done
[16:31:19] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: :)
[16:31:20] <fas3r> ho ok :)
[16:32:27] <fas3r> it's the first time that I use insertAfter.... when I was using appendTo or prependTo I was doing $('#TheDiv').html(data); ..
[16:32:38] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: well thanks anyway :).
[16:35:07] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: an other stupid question .. when creating function ... is there any other "section" that we can call/define such as the "init" section ?
[16:35:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:35:31] <fas3r> :)
[16:35:54] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: I will give you an example.
[16:40:37] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[16:41:12] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: something like this : http://jsfiddle.net/694Lm7v4/
[16:41:51] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:41:53] <robertmaxrees> why>
[16:41:55] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:42:03] <robertmaxrees> this is a really awkward design to work around.
[16:43:28] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: well you can create a panel of function and initiate them then the document is ready. is not a good way ?
[16:43:51] <jimmt> if there is a jquery element variable called elem defined within a loop, and data has been set to it with .data, how can I make the function given to it by .click reference that specific element's .data
[16:44:03] <jimmt> as it is if I reference elem in the function supplied it only references the last elem the loop makes
[16:44:03] <robertmaxrees> jimmt huh?
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[16:45:09] <jimmt> http://pointblank.bz/c/console.html#
[16:45:52] <jimmt> I know I can just assign it an onclick as a string and concatenate the id into the string
[16:45:56] <jimmt> but that seems suboptimal
[16:46:08] <robertmaxrees> jimmt a fiddle?
[16:46:22] <jimmt> why do you need a fiddle?
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> so i can modify the code and show you.
[16:46:32] <jimmt> I have it live on that page there
[16:46:41] <jimmt> if you insist
[16:47:52] <jimmt> https://jsfiddle.net/L0gazsmz/
[16:48:31] <jimmt> really, it seems like these .click() or other functions should be passed the object they belong to
[16:49:07] <jimmt> like elem.click(function(e){ alert(e.append("a")); })
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no need to do that
[16:49:40] <jimmt> that's how this kind of thing is done in other languages
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean, the way you'
[16:50:07] <robertmaxrees> *you're binding things.
[16:50:17] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[16:52:17] <jimmt> well, seems like I found the answer anyway
[16:52:19] <jimmt> http://stackoverflow.com/a/750506
[16:52:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L0gazsmz/1/
[16:52:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this) refers to the element that emitted the event.
[16:53:02] <jimmt> also works, thanks
[16:53:14] <robertmaxrees> event.currentTarget is another reference.
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> fas3r so i don't understand why you think you need to init like that.
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> like, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/694Lm7v4/1/ - this works just fine with far less boilerplate to get you there.
[17:13:46] <acidjazz> sup robertmaxrees
[17:18:34] <robertmaxrees> yo
[17:23:01] <acidjazz> see my matrix3d thing
[17:23:02] <acidjazz> i did
[17:23:06] <acidjazz> that im so happy to show off
[17:23:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:23:16] <acidjazz> http://v2.astrostudios.com/work/
[17:23:20] <acidjazz> hover the thumbnails
[17:24:02] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[17:24:47] <acidjazz> yea im distorting via the cursor position of each thumbnail
[17:25:38] <acidjazz> like it? look good on your scren?
[17:25:40] <acidjazz> screen*
[19:11:45] <acidjazz> how hard would it be to override a jquery function
[19:11:54] <acidjazz> like id like to have $.get always call a function when .fail is called
[19:11:58] <acidjazz> unless specified
[19:26:54] <zumba_ad_> good evening folks. How can check if our ajax is in pending? It's because timeout doesn't cancel t
[19:26:56] <zumba_ad_> it
[19:33:43] <shoky> zumba_ad_ keep in mind JSONP is not ajax
[19:33:55] <zumba_ad_> oh yeah, it's script :(
[19:33:58] <shoky> yep
[19:34:12] <shoky> just let it go man
[19:34:21] <zumba_ad_> it's been annoying me sho much
[19:34:22] <shoky> so you get an error in js console, so what
[19:34:36] <zumba_ad_> oh, the error is good now
[19:34:43] <shoky> o
[19:34:52] <zumba_ad_> i got that fixed and i haven't seen it for 2 day snow
[19:34:56] <zumba_ad_> days now
[19:35:22] <shoky> so what's the problem now?
[19:35:23] <zumba_ad_> now, I'm trying to simulate issues so I'll know how to address
[19:35:40] <shoky> oks
[19:35:46] <zumba_ad_> i'm disconnecting my network and my request goes in pending mode which is fine
[19:36:02] <zumba_ad_> i have a timeout of 20 seconds but it doesn't get followed when network is down
[19:36:17] <shoky> it doesn't trigger the error callback?
[19:36:24] <zumba_ad_> it only gets followed when there is network connectivity. 20 seconds timeout really happens
[19:36:28] <zumba_ad_> yup
[19:36:35] <zumba_ad_> wait, no n
[19:37:02] <zumba_ad_> so my app does a jsonp request while network is down
[19:37:23] <zumba_ad_> immediately it's in pending mode. I was hoping that in 20 seconds, it will fail but it didn't
[19:37:28] <zumba_ad_> it failed on the 55th second
[19:37:57] <shoky> why are you using jsonp btw..?
[19:38:19] <zumba_ad_> when i started supporting this, it was already in jsonp. However, i heard good news today
[19:38:33] <zumba_ad_> the other team is shutting down their jsonp service and enabling cors
[19:38:43] <shoky> that should make things nicer ;p
[19:38:46] <zumba_ad_> yup
[19:39:15] <zumba_ad_> cors isn't needed if same domain right?
[19:39:25] <shoky> right
[19:39:29] <zumba_ad_> k
[19:39:44] <shoky> same origin
[19:40:09] <zumba_ad_> gotcha
[19:43:06] <teamcoltra> Hey guys, is there a way of seeing if a page anchor exists yet? I am infinit scrolling / lazy loading my content and I want to be able to directly link to a certain paragraph so if someone has index.html#1 and <div id='1'> doesn't exist, I would like to load it
[19:43:52] <zumba_ad_> i'm checking the other endpoint call that I'd like to put in localStorage first. It's our logging. I thought it was only logging to console but was shocked why I was seeing pending, LOL. It was doing a POST
[19:43:53] <teamcoltra> I know how to do it if a person clicked a link, but how can I determine it from the url they came from
[19:44:59] <jphase> teamcoltra: window.location.hash.substr(1) will get you the hash of the current url
[19:46:03] <teamcoltra> jphase thanks that's exactly what I was looking for
[21:18:50] <d3m0n> Can someone take a look at my custom plugin? I am trying to make it so I can put multi selectors inside one plugin initilizer. I know it has something to do with an each(). If I initilize seperately (eg. $('ele1').classSelector(); $('ele2').classSelector(); it works fine. - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QjyOLW?editors=101
[21:24:49] <d3m0n> This actually looks like it might work: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QjyOLW?editors=101
[21:24:54] <d3m0n> What do you guys think?
[21:36:43] <acidjazz> is it easily possible to wrap a jquery function.. say i want write a function that completely wraps $.get, but defaults the .fail handler to do something specific, is that remotely possible?
[21:37:06] <acidjazz> shoky: any idear?
[21:46:22] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/efr7m486/2/   how to get the columns count of an html table i try in the fiddle but not return, 5, thanks
[22:41:43] <placidb> could it be that .parent() is broken after directly manipulating some HTML of one of its children?
[22:42:11] <Uhkis> what do you mean "broken"?
[22:42:23] <placidb> well .parent().html() on the object returns undefined
[22:42:33] <placidb> because .parent() returns undefined
[22:42:44] <placidb> I have some HTML that I'm injecting HTML into its child
[22:42:47] <placidb> and I remove it again also
[22:42:57] <placidb> the before and after are identical
[22:43:10] <placidb> yet .parent() fails after stripping the previously injected HTML
[22:45:38] <placidb> wait actually .parent() gives me an object but .parent().html() is undefined .. ?
[22:52:12] <Uhkis> fiddle?
[23:00:18] <placidb> Uhkis: I think a fiddle would be a little tricky to set up, because of the size of my project .. but you can see it working here: http://www.gebroedersniemeijer.staging.brigaid.nl/en/#product-range
[23:00:54] <placidb> problematic code starts at line 112 in http://www.gebroedersniemeijer.staging.brigaid.nl/js/niemeijer.js
[23:09:30] <Uhkis> placidb: fix the errors first
[23:11:49] <placidb> Uhkis: what errors?
[23:12:26] <placidb> console log is silent upon load here
[23:18:45] <Uhkis> that's because there's errors
[23:22:56] <placidb> where do you see the errors?
[23:24:23] <Uhkis> event is not defined on #61
[23:28:54] <placidb> hm
[23:28:58] <placidb> what browser are you using?
[23:30:10] <Uhkis> firefox
[23:42:45] <placidb> Uhkis: thank you. Chrome wasn't saying anything about this so I missed it.
[23:44:27] <placidb> but it's fixed now
[23:44:57] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/k47y6dz5/ why doesn't this work on mobile?
[23:45:09] <Kartagis> I mean on phonegap
[23:47:22] <Uhkis> for one, nid isn't defined
[23:47:52] <lenswipee> For two?
[23:49:04] <Uhkis> for second, seems like you're getting multiple click handlers on every resume/deviceready
[23:49:29] <lenswipee> For three?
[23:49:46] <Uhkis> this is #jquery, not #phonegap
