[04:30:03] <aways> Hi all
[05:19:07] <Felishia> I have a jquery object that contains 2 elements
[05:19:11] <Felishia> how can I pick one by id?
[05:19:22] <Felishia> I try .find and it just doesn't find anything
[05:22:05] <Felishia> FFS
[05:22:07] <Felishia> nothing works
[05:47:56] <localh0st> Felishia: code
[05:48:03] <Felishia> nvm I fixed it
[05:48:06] <Felishia> -.-
[05:48:09] <Felishia> but that was annoyin'
[06:07:15] <AdamPDotty> complete misunderstanding of .find()
[06:24:48] <Cork> also if you have an id just select it
[06:25:07] <Cork> no point in doing dom relation when you have an unique id
[06:32:54] <neo_> hi guys
[06:32:57] <neo_> I need help
[06:33:10] <neo_> who know how create this map https://bikroy.com/
[06:33:25] <neo_> I need create similar map , but I don't know how there was created
[06:33:31] <neo_> how know ?
[06:40:27] <emporio> Can anyone solve this?
[06:40:28] <emporio> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45164282/faulty-img-tag-not-displaying-images-in-internet-explorer
[06:53:48] <FilipNortic> emporio: have you tried removing the src attr in the $.ready() part of the code?
[06:54:44] <AdamPDotty> technically the src attribute contents is "&lt;img width="
[06:54:53] <emporio> FilipNortic: yes i have
[06:54:59] <AdamPDotty> still a lot remaining, junk in junk out
[06:55:16] <iaj> Hi folks!
[06:55:44] <iaj> Need some advice.. does someone know a decent plugin to generate a slot machine with indiviudal images?
[06:55:53] <iaj> individual*
[07:08:42] <localh0st> emporio: you should make the wordpress output valid instead of trying to fix it with js....
[07:08:53] <emporio> localh0st: you have a point there
[07:09:03] <emporio> I just mailed the author about this
[07:09:10] <emporio> moving on to something else
[09:05:59] <aways> Hi; question about js and strict mode
[09:06:42] <aways> When i place the strict mode on a loaded js file by .load() ; my module isn't accesible ; without 'use strict' it's ok
[09:07:04] <aways> Why use strict break the definition in the global scope
[09:07:53] <MikeD_> i suggest you build with "use strict" in place before anything else
[09:08:27] <MikeD_> if you are bringing in code from before "use strict" was a thing, you're probably going to have a rough day :)
[09:09:20] <aways> https://jsfiddle.net/0uhuv9y7/
[09:09:22] <aways> with this
[09:09:43] <aways> when use strict is present foo.init() => call init on undef
[09:10:03] <aways> without use strict it's rocks
[09:24:21] <Sagar> we can get e.originalEvent.touches[0] on mobile and touch devices using touchstart, how do we obtain e.originalEvent.touches[0] in Desktop/Laptops? It's giving me undefined error.
[09:29:40] <FilipNortic> Sagar: a non touch event wouldn't have that property defined
[09:30:44] <FilipNortic> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
[09:30:53] <Sagar> then how to get it on desktop?
[09:31:43] <FilipNortic> you can check what properties different event has in the link ^
[09:32:16] <Sagar> Actually it's a scollable thing
[09:32:21] <Sagar> it works fine on mobile due to touch events
[09:32:28] <Sagar> but i want to make it work on desktop as wel
[09:36:01] <FilipNortic> don't know enough to help you there, but there should be a not so difficult way to solve that
[09:51:09] <Cork> Sagar: you mean for a desktop device with touch screen?
[09:51:40] <Sagar> yeah
[09:51:43] <Sagar> Cork: Yes
[09:51:58] <Cork> i suspect that it isn't supported for desktop at all
[09:52:08] <Cork> but i haven't tried
[09:54:04] <FilipNortic> oh so a touch event triggers but the touch properties isn't defined
[09:54:11] <Sagar> Yeah
[09:54:22] <Sagar> That's what i am trying to do, if we could add touch properties on browser with any js?
[09:55:37] <FilipNortic> i think most event-properties are read only
[09:55:44] <Cork> Sagar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/touches#Browser_compatibility
[09:56:30] <Cork> so what you get there depends on what browser you have, and there isn't any polyfill as far as i know
[09:56:37] <Sagar> Ok
[09:57:36] <FilipNortic> wow ff52 is just a couple of months ago
[09:57:56] <Cork> FilipNortic: and is actually the current version for esr
[09:58:12] <Cork> and A LOT of user uses it now days
[09:58:34] <Cork> (as mozilla breaks the normal build right left and center right now)
[09:59:20] <FilipNortic> just updated to 53
[09:59:24] <FilipNortic> mistake?
[10:43:16] <Malgorath> Hello, I am trying to do something new for me, I'm creating a div with $('body').append('<div id="myFrame"></div>); which works perfectly, but after that I do $('#myFrame').append('<button id="closeBtn">X</button>'); which appends fine, my problem its not seeing my $('#closeBtn').click(function (evt) { part, any suggestions?
[10:44:31] <localh0st> Malgorath: because it was inserted after DOM was loaded, change click function to event listener:
[10:45:01] <Malgorath> ah okay
[10:45:01] <localh0st> $(document).on("click", "#closeBtn", function() { });
[10:45:02] <Malgorath> thanks
[10:48:33] <Malgorath> localh0st, can you look at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/963451fdf324f70aaa5c6c37ff484350 and tell me where I went wrong as its not working still
[10:49:13] <localh0st> Malgorath: $('document').on("click", '#closeBtn', function (evt) {
[10:49:22] <localh0st> this is outside of $("document").ready(function ($) { ?
[10:49:51] <Malgorath> I had it inside and got same result, moved it there to see if that was an issue or not
[10:50:20] <localh0st> +
[10:50:21] <localh0st> $('document')
[10:50:27] <localh0st> should be: $(document)
[10:51:12] <localh0st> you should have all errors logged in your browser's console
[10:51:28] <Malgorath> I am using Chrome and I don't see any errors popping up
[10:51:42] <Malgorath> ugh
[10:51:44] <Malgorath> it works not
[10:52:05] <Malgorath> was the 'document' crap, so on my "document").ready should I take the " out there also?
[10:52:14] <Malgorath> er it works now
[12:33:26] <taplar> ba da bap, ba da da ba da da, ba da da
[12:38:56] <neo_> hi
[12:39:18] <neo_> how translate 'breaking news' ? it's means direct ?
[12:40:21] <neo_> I frequently listen on BBC 'breaking news' and don't know what it means
[12:40:32] <robertmaxrees> neo_ it means "We just got a report"
[12:40:38] <neo_> :)
[12:40:43] <robertmaxrees> usually it means something is happening now.
[12:40:44] <neo_> ok, I silence
[12:41:19] <neo_> why use breaking ?
[12:41:27] <neo_> breaking means other
[12:41:55] <taplar> they usually are breaking into the regularly scheduled programming
[12:41:56] <neo_> it's can translate like 'broken news' :)
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_news
[12:42:21] <taplar> or i believe that is the historic reason for the verbage
[12:42:25] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:42:27] <robertmaxrees> 100%
[12:42:36] <neo_> ok
[12:42:37] <robertmaxrees> they're "breaking in" to the regularly scheduled programming.
[12:43:00] <kof> may be its heart breaking
[12:43:14] <kof> news those can breaks heart
[12:43:28] <robertmaxrees> kof nah.
[12:43:31] <neo_> yes , I bad understand what means 'breaking in' , more clearly 'broken princess ' )))
[12:43:39] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:43:54] <neo_> break down also clearly
[12:44:13] <taplar> kof: it depends on the station i would assume.  it may be breaking news that a kardashian got a new butt job, but it's not heart breaking.  maybe zipper breaking, but not heart breaking.
[12:44:18] <taplar> unless you have a heart condition
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:45:09] <neo_> ok, we understood this work difficult learn , using in any cases in differ way
[12:45:17] <neo_> word*
[12:45:30] <robertmaxrees> neo_ lots of word in english are like that.
[12:45:39] <kof> yes lol
[12:45:42] <neo_> no
[12:45:46] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:45:59] <taplar> context is important in most languages i'd assume
[12:46:00] <neo_> it's like offend also was at first difficult
[12:46:11] <neo_> or advance
[12:46:15] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:46:20] <neo_> complexity words both
[12:46:29] <robertmaxrees> lots of idioms and turns of phrase that don't really fully make sense unless you have context on them.
[12:46:29] <neo_> I offended you ?
[12:46:37] <robertmaxrees> you haven't offended me...
[12:46:46] <neo_> or terrorists offend on someone
[12:46:49] <robertmaxrees> errr.,
[12:46:58] <taplar> not sure where this is going
[12:47:16] <neo_> I say breaking similar word
[12:47:21] <neo_> break
[12:47:28] <robertmaxrees> i think he means that offend means both to hurt somebody's feelings vs commit a crime.
[12:47:38] <neo_> no
[12:47:43] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:47:44] <neo_> means attack
[12:47:49] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:47:52] <neo_> army offend , it' use also
[12:48:01] <robertmaxrees> you mean offense
[12:48:01] <taplar> i wouldn't say offend means commit a crime.  offense maybe
[12:48:11] <robertmaxrees> sure it does.
[12:48:26] <neo_> army offend other country , offend means also attack
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/YmVYOG4.png
[12:48:43] <neo_> oh maybe offense
[12:48:50] <neo_> I confused :)
[12:48:55] <taplar> yeah, AC just said 'first offender'
[12:48:56] <robertmaxrees> you can commit an "offence"
[12:49:24] <robertmaxrees> it's a loaded word, of course.
[12:49:55] <neo_> no , offend
[12:50:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:07] <taplar> we're agreeing
[12:50:08] <neo_> I read in book about WW2 there was offend sooner
[12:50:18] <neo_> army offend
[12:50:27] <neo_> you confused me
[12:50:28] <robertmaxrees> offensive, maybe.
[12:50:33] <taplar> i don't know that i've ever heard of an army offending another
[12:50:38] <taplar> attacking, sure
[12:50:41] <robertmaxrees> militaries can mount an offensive strike./
[12:51:12] <neo_> history book very difficult read there many words
[12:51:19] <taplar> lol
[12:51:29] <robertmaxrees> see: the Tet Offensive
[12:51:40] <neo_> in book about war rarely use attack
[12:51:50] <neo_> offensive objective , it's not verb
[12:52:05] <neo_> it was verb
[12:52:07] <taplar> adjative?
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> *adjective
[12:52:10] <taplar> (sp)
[12:52:48] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_(military)
[12:52:54] <robertmaxrees> (Shrug) common use of the phraser.
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> *phrase
[12:54:09] <neo_> I can't read historical book in English only technical :(
[12:54:15] <neo_> books
[12:54:26] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's because of the loaded language.
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> also some of those books can be full of a lot of jargon
[12:55:39] <neo_> no because I read only technical and don't have vocabulary for other books
[12:55:47] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[12:55:57] <taplar> what's a technical war book?
[12:56:05] <neo_> the more difficult genre of books is about history
[12:56:12] <neo_> :)
[12:56:18] <robertmaxrees> he means technical literature, not history literatuire
[12:56:28] <robertmaxrees> and neo_ i'm explaining the reason it's likely difficult.
[12:56:37] <robertmaxrees> but what would I know (shrug)
[12:56:48] <neo_> he joke , he asked not serious
[12:57:03] <taplar> no, i really don't know what a technical literature book is
[12:57:15] <robertmaxrees> taplar think MDN
[12:57:24] <robertmaxrees> stuff like that.
[12:57:39] <neo_> about jQuery or javascript for example
[12:57:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:57:46] <taplar> so there are history books that are worse than normal history books?  lol
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:57:55] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:58:14] <robertmaxrees> nah, he's just saying that history books in general tend to be harder to understand than technical stuff.
[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> also: literature books is a tautology
[12:59:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:59:54] <neo_> interesting history book 'Stalingrad' about Germany 6th army I read it in native , but couldn't do it in English :(
[13:00:07] <taplar> could be a picture book, :D
[13:00:07] <robertmaxrees> what's your native language?
[13:00:10] <neo_> 50 pages read and dropped
[13:00:14] <neo_> russian
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> neat
[13:00:49] <robertmaxrees> slavic languages are fascinating to me
[13:01:11] <neo_> ok
[13:03:28] <taplar> well, that event propagated nicely, but now it looks like it dropped
[13:03:34] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:04:27] <robertmaxrees> i'm waiting for a final part to fix one of my amps and i keep looking at the tracking
[13:04:37] <taplar> i hate that
[13:04:42] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:05:49] <taplar> we have a fedex hub on site that when i buy some things i usually have them shipped here, so i'll be hitting it with the tracking number through out the day to see if i can run and get it
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> nice
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> that's gotta be convenient
[13:06:49] <taplar> yeah, it's pretty nice.
[13:07:13] <taplar> don't want something shipped home cause they might leave the box at the door?  hell no!
[13:07:41] <robertmaxrees> hah, we don't have a hub on site, though there is a ups one across the street.  most people just get stuff shipped here anyway
[13:08:14] <taplar> hey, close enough, :)
[13:08:34] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:09:03] <taplar> i'd almost prefer that over ours.  as when i built my last pc, i had all my stuff sent here, expect for the case.  figured something that large they'd be like, wtf is this?
[13:09:30] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.  that doesn't stop people here.  folks get all kinds of HUGE packages delivered here.
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> we get returns for https://www.build.com/kohler-k-690-kitchen-faucet/s563125?uid=2669472 every once in a while.
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't seem all that weiurd until you look at the specs on it.,
[13:17:09] <taplar> are those units in inches i assume?
[13:17:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> that faucet is almost 17" tall
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> and reaches almost 9.5" out from where you mount it.
[13:18:01] <robertmaxrees> they're comically oversized.
[13:18:03] <taplar> how come they get returned there?  i thought we had talked once that your site used other distributors?
[13:18:16] <robertmaxrees> we do, but things still get sent here for returns.
[13:18:22] <taplar> huh
[13:18:45] <robertmaxrees> not everything, but most stuff.  we have a warehouse.
[13:23:25] <taplar> i just noticed something.  the share icons on the lhs don't have alt text while the ones at the bottom do
[13:23:38] <taplar> i was trying to figure out what the phone was
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> don't get my started on those.
[13:24:32] <robertmaxrees> *me
[13:24:37] <taplar> lol
[13:25:32] <robertmaxrees> fun fact: they DO have alt text.
[13:25:42] <robertmaxrees> but those aren't normal img tags.
[13:25:58] <taplar> oh, are they icons?  *goes to inspect*
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:27:02] <taplar> ah, :before stuff
[13:27:22] <taplar> so alt stuff doesn't trigger on :before content.  interesting
[13:27:53] <robertmaxrees> or anchors
[13:28:06] <robertmaxrees> titles do though.
[13:28:42] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9cq310y4/
[13:29:39] <taplar> isn't the alt text used for readers though?
[13:30:07] <taplar> i vaguely think i remember scanning over a reader guide and it saying something like that
[13:30:48] <taplar> any who, i take it you brought up the title thing and it got dismissed?  :)
[13:30:59] <robertmaxrees> nah i'm about to fix it right now.
[13:31:21] <robertmaxrees> and not necessarily.  alt is used when the image can't be shown.  title is supposed to be shown along with things.
[13:31:32] * taplar user, being a uxer pita all over the place
[14:21:05] <EastFlow> isn't edge the best browser ever
[14:21:16] <taplar> never tried it
[14:21:27] <EastFlow> u should always use edge
[14:21:32] <taplar> lol
[14:21:33] <EastFlow> everyone needs edge
[14:21:47] <taplar> i'm happy with my existing browsers, thx
[14:22:15] <robertmaxrees> it's much better than IE was, that's for sure.
[14:23:00] <taplar> http://gs.statcounter.com/
[14:32:56] <taplar> can't wait to finish changing my page over to vue and compare the performances
[14:34:07] <orbyt_> I'd like to select all <input/> and <textarea/> elements with a parent of #myform. I assume this is something like $('#myform > input, #myform > textarea') correct?
[14:34:16] <robertmaxrees> orbyt_ drop the >
[14:34:32] <robertmaxrees> or do $('#myform').find('input, textarea')
[14:34:32] <orbyt_> So $('#myform input, #myform textarea') ?
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> that or what I showed.
[14:34:59] <orbyt_> I assume I can then chain a listener to the end of find()?
[14:35:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:35:24] <taplar> $('#myform').on(event, 'input, textarea', handler)
[14:35:25] <robertmaxrees> tho i might approach that listener differently.
[14:35:37] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ what taplar just showed haha
[14:35:51] <orbyt_> This is the delegated listener thing we discussed the other day, right?
[14:35:57] <orbyt_> I believe it is.
[14:36:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:36:20] <orbyt_> Alright, will try these. Thanks robertmaxrees taplar
[14:38:55] <orbyt_> Actually, while were on the topic, the event i'll be binding to is 'blur'. I then want to pass the input of the field into a validation function. What's the best way to access the element and it's input value inside this listener?
[14:39:05] <robertmaxrees> $(this)
[14:39:22] <orbyt_> And that will represent the blurred input, not the form?
[14:39:26] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:39:41] <orbyt_> Cool, 👍. Thank you.
[14:41:47] <taplar> do you want blur or change?
[14:41:54] <robertmaxrees> or on input!
[14:42:02] <taplar> true
[14:43:17] <orbyt_> taplar The current implementation was using blur, so I was going with that. Validating on every change would probably be fine.
[14:51:32] <taplar> would potentially execute less
[14:59:48] <orbyt_> Another follow up question: I can use $(this) to access the matched input inside `$('#myform').on(event, 'input, textarea', handler)`
[15:00:00] <orbyt_> Inside that handler, how would I access #myform?
[15:00:10] <taplar> .closest('form')
[15:00:15] <orbyt_> Or more specifically, its actual DOM element?
[15:00:23] <taplar> .closest('form').get(0)
[15:00:39] <orbyt_> Will give that a go.
[15:01:04] <taplar> why do you need the raw dom node?
[15:02:02] <orbyt_> The validationFunction someone else wrote takes the entire form element as a param -.-
[15:02:09] <taplar> ah
[15:02:19] <orbyt_> That worked as expected though, thank you.
[15:02:55] <orbyt_> Back in a bit.
[15:18:25] <JonelethIrenicus> is it possible to have one $(document).on('input ready') type function that does the check on input and also on load?
[15:18:46] <taplar> sure
[15:19:30] <taplar> $(document).on('input load', handler);
[15:19:49] <taplar> though, iirc, load may have to be bound to window
[15:20:03] <JonelethIrenicus> what does that mean?
[15:20:18] <taplar> i'm not sure that document gets the load event
[15:20:33] <JonelethIrenicus> oh
[15:21:22] <taplar> function blah(){}  $(window).on('load', blah); $(document).on('input', blah);
[15:22:24] <JonelethIrenicus> if i use a function like blah(){} will it still have access to $(this) ?
[15:22:29] <taplar> yep
[15:22:38] <JonelethIrenicus> cool
[15:23:05] <taplar> 'this' would be different in the two cases though
[15:23:15] <taplar> window vs document respectively
[15:23:16] <JonelethIrenicus> oh
[15:23:35] <JonelethIrenicus> ok
[15:23:35] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[15:23:49] <JonelethIrenicus> just change some input boxes if they are within a certain varience
[15:23:56] <JonelethIrenicus> also check them on load
[15:24:15] <taplar> then i might suggest a small change
[15:25:09] <taplar> $(window).on('load', function(){ var temp = $(selectAllTheThings);   temp.forEach(blah); }); $(document).on('input', blah);
[15:25:55] <taplar> if you made the document one a delegate the
[15:26:29] <taplar> 'this' would be the element in that case too
[15:27:36] <JonelethIrenicus> hmm i am gonna have to play around with that never done that before
[15:31:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cy8uroa3/1/
[15:33:19] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: oh wow thank you
[15:33:24] <JonelethIrenicus> that works perfectly
[15:33:32] <JonelethIrenicus> i am going to use that more often haha
[15:49:51] <taplar> i feel sad when i go to a website about two-way binding, and their page loads super slow
[16:13:54] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: what is that?
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> JonelethIrenicus you mean two-way binding?
[16:39:57] <taplar> JonelethIrenicus: it's a way of relating dom element values to a javascript object in some manner, so that they reflect each other
[16:41:18] <JonelethIrenicus> ah
[16:42:40] <taplar> at minimum, it gives you direct access to the values without having to find the elements on the page
[16:43:05] <taplar> at larger usages, frameworks can build what the users sees off of changes to it
[16:43:28] <taplar> but it can allow for a split between the M/V layer of the page
[16:50:56] <taplar> been trying to see how difficult it would be to make just a twb plugin
[17:39:47] <JonelethIrenicus> taplar: sounds like it might be good, but then again i dont know alot about it
[17:41:01] <taplar> which part?
[18:12:18] <taplar> so slow today
[18:12:42] <robertmaxrees> hella
[18:12:55] <robertmaxrees> wonder why
[18:13:31] <taplar> some holiday we didn't get the memo on
[18:14:12] <taplar> though it was slow yesterday too.  i checked the logs after i left and no one had said anything else, lol
[18:14:23] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[18:14:24] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:15:22] <taplar> i was going to login to my site and change the htaccess so i could hit it from remote, but work blocked the ssh port i guess. bah!
[18:15:46] <robertmaxrees> laaaaaame
[18:15:58] <taplar> yeah
[18:19:42] <falseascension> Hey, I'm having an issue building HTML. I am trying to create some elements and append them to an existing element in the page. I'm trying to do that by doing something similar to this: tab = $('div', {class : 'tab'}); $("#element").append(tab); However this doesn't work (no errors either). However, when I try $("#element").append("<div class='tab'></div>"); it works just fine. What am I doing wrong?
[18:20:03] <robertmaxrees> tab = $('div', {class :
[18:20:03] <robertmaxrees> 'tab'});
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> woops - you want '<div>'
[18:20:14] <robertmaxrees> not 'div'
[18:20:23] <falseascension> Oh i see
[18:20:35] <falseascension> Welp, that's a lot of wasted time down the drain.
[18:20:37] <falseascension> cheers!
[18:20:55] <taplar> one's a selector, the other is markup
[18:21:05] <falseascension> uhm
[18:21:15] <robertmaxrees> he's right/.
[18:21:21] <falseascension> It filled the element with [object Object]
[18:21:28] <falseascension> it says that a bunch on the page now
[18:21:28] <robertmaxrees> right, a jquery object.
[18:21:33] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[18:21:37] <falseascension> hang on
[18:21:42] <falseascension> screenshot?
[18:21:46] <robertmaxrees> code.
[18:21:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:22:03] <falseascension> I'll get a screenshot with the results and the code?
[18:22:14] <robertmaxrees> just the code.
[18:22:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:22:16] <robertmaxrees> donm'
[18:22:20] <robertmaxrees> *don't need a screenshot.
[18:22:21] <falseascension> okay
[18:23:17] <robertmaxrees> because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uevruv5z/
[18:23:19] <robertmaxrees> should work fine.
[18:23:40] <falseascension> https://pastebin.com/q32kfZ9U
[18:23:59] <robertmaxrees>  tab.html(
[18:24:01] <robertmaxrees> not wha3t you want.
[18:24:15] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[18:24:18] <robertmaxrees> it takes a string.
[18:24:26] <falseascension> I see
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> you're giving it a series of jquery objects.
[18:24:44] <robertmaxrees> since you can't add objects together like that, it's coercing them to strings.
[18:24:51] <falseascension> Ahh okay
[18:24:54] <robertmaxrees> giving you the [object Object]
[18:25:07] <robertmaxrees> just do a series of appends.
[18:25:21] <falseascension> sorry, i've not used js in a while,,, gotten rusty
[18:25:31] <robertmaxrees> also: check out using delegated event listeners instead of using onclick
[18:25:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:25:43] <falseascension> I'll look into that
[18:26:23] <falseascension> Is a series of appends the only way? I feel like that would make my code look cluttered
[18:27:53] <taplar> you can append a list of elements
[18:27:59] <falseascension> Ah okay
[18:28:05] <falseascension> that'll work
[18:28:07] <falseascension> thanks
[18:28:29] <taplar> so you can build the list with either an each or a map, and then append that result
[18:28:49] <taplar> jQuery will put it in a dom fragment so it's only one update
[18:30:08] <falseascension> This works, thanks
[18:33:50] <robertmaxrees> falseascension if you're worried about your code looking cluttered, I'd avoid using jquery as a templating engine in the first place :)
[18:34:23] <falseascension> That's a good point, but i'm doing very little templating. This is probably my only need for it.
[18:34:36] <falseascension> I doubt i'll be doing it for any other parts of my program
[18:34:53] <robertmaxrees> just something to consider.
[18:50:32] <orbyt_> Hmm, I assumed the 'change' event on an input field would be triggered as you type ala React's onChange.
[18:50:44] <robertmaxrees> nope.  that's the input event.
[18:50:45] <orbyt_> I assume this is incorrect..
[18:51:00] <robertmaxrees> change fires after the input loses focus if its contents have actually changfed
[18:51:23] <orbyt_> I'm looking at https://api.jquery.com/category/events/form-events/
[18:51:29] <orbyt_> Where is the "input" event?
[18:51:53] <robertmaxrees> just use .on() instead.
[18:52:02] <robertmaxrees> .on('input', function() {});
[18:53:03] <orbyt_> Yea, i'm just wondering where the docs are for it
[18:53:11] <robertmaxrees> there are none in jquery.
[18:53:14] <robertmaxrees> it's a native event
[18:53:21] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[18:54:26] <orbyt_> I see. A bit odd though, no? I would assume as it's passed into their .on() function that it would be documented
[18:54:36] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[18:55:08] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/ -> "Any event names can be used for the events argument. jQuery will pass through the browser's standard JavaScript event types, calling the handler function when the browser generates events due to user actions such as click."
[18:55:38] <orbyt_> Ah, cool. Will give that a go then, thank you.
[19:19:01] <goodenough> is there a way to kinda recreate this select? where the the highlighted selected item will be magnified, and the rest are greyed out and skewed?
[19:19:04] <goodenough> https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pp3O1.png
[19:19:33] <robertmaxrees> is it possible?  yeah.
[19:21:54] <goodenough> yea that looks like a lot of work. imma try it
[19:22:20] <robertmaxrees> >>>
[19:22:22] <robertmaxrees> *>.>
[19:22:26] <robertmaxrees> why would you try to recreate it?
[19:22:59] <robertmaxrees> it's apart of the browser itself.
[19:26:55] <goodenough> not recreating it, my bad. I just need the same functionality, where you touch scroll, and the middle item is styled differently
