[01:13:41] <Cork> darkhanb: still? it needs to be a bultipart form-data
[01:13:50] <Cork> it is the only way you can send binary data
[01:14:07] <Cork> s/bultipart/multipart
[01:14:08] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> darkhanb: still? it needs to be a multipart form-data
[01:14:50] <darkhanb> Cork well, in my case google storage PUT expects just the raw binary data
[01:15:21] <Cork> are you sure it is meant to support ajax requests?
[01:15:49] <Cork> cause what you get is what is expected
[01:16:47] <darkhanb> I'm fairly certain...? anyway, it's working for me in my situation
[01:17:25] <Cork> cause normally you shouldn't be able to update a File object
[01:17:45] <Cork> among other things it can't hold any info about what the content is
[01:17:58] <Cork> (like filename, or content-type for the file)
[01:19:23] <darkhanb> sorry I gotta run, but you make me doubt myself :)
[01:19:33] <darkhanb> thanks for responses though
[01:19:50] <Cork> np, and you might be right, i've never pushed anything to google storage
[01:20:02] <Cork> i just find it strange with what limitations it causes
[01:20:46] <darkhanb> from the top of my head, I can think of multipart form-data is HTTP, while google storage is more lower level, TCP...
[01:21:27] <Cork> no, it can't be, cause ajax can't do tcp
[01:21:58] <Cork> but ya, feels like i will have to look into that; makes me too curious :)
[01:25:44] <boxingoreos> Hey everyone, I had a question about jQuery Mobile.  Right now I have a listview in which each item is clickable and links to popup form that you can submit to edit said item.  Right now I have it creating this pop-up for every item on the page, which results in 10,000+ lines of html when its loaded.  Is there way to have one div for the popup for editing where the information is populated dependent on which item you click instea
[04:58:51] <Neo4> boxingoreos: yes, you can make ajax request and get needed data
[04:59:09] <Neo4> not load all data instantly, or I don't know
[04:59:37] <Neo4> or put data in file and this file will in cash one times load to browser instead many times
[05:41:21] <pokmo> hi
[05:41:37] <pokmo> i have an iframe like <iframe allowtransparency="true" length="1px" style="position: relative; height: 200px;"></iframe> but .height() gives 196. does anyone know why?
[05:41:44] <pokmo> shouldn't .height() give 200?
[06:00:54] <Cork> pokmo: i THINK it gives height minus the border so two at the top and two and the bottom; but haven't used iframes much in ages and ages
[06:01:02] <pokmo> Cork yeah you're right
[06:01:43] <Cork> pokmo: you could try box-sizing: border-box;
[06:02:07] <pokmo> ah thanks
[06:02:30] <Cork> hmm
[06:02:37] <Cork> what browser are this in btw?
[06:02:45] <Cork> cause https://jsfiddle.net/c0w1qq07/ == 200
[06:48:32] <pokmo> Cork it's safari
[06:49:02] <Cork> scary, though they are the only one that supports dynamic height for iframes if i remember correctly
[06:49:20] <Cork> might have something to do with that (seamless iframes i think it is called)
[10:13:18] <jak2000> hi
[10:13:21] <jak2000> friends
[10:13:59] <jak2000> i have a tablet and want in an input text read with camara a Codebar, how to?
[11:42:55] <jak2000> hi all
[11:43:05] <jak2000> taplar escuse me ask directly but you know muy plugins
[11:43:07] <jak2000> is possible this:
[11:43:08] <taplar> morning
[11:43:26] <jak2000> morning, i have a tablet and want in an input text read with camara a Codebar, how to? exist a plugin?
[11:44:07] <taplar> i don't know of a javascript plugin that is capable of grabbing the camera input
[11:44:15] <taplar> that seems kinda outside the scope of javascript
[11:44:21] <taplar> you might ask ##javascript
[11:45:04] <Cork> if i remember correctly it is exposed to canvas
[11:45:20] <Cork> and you can dump that to a blob
[11:45:30] <taplar> interesting
[11:45:56] <Cork> ex. https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs
[11:46:34] <taplar> then comes the fun of figuring out how to convert that barcode image into text
[11:47:03] <Cork> hmm text to barcode exists as a lib i know
[11:47:07] <Cork> but other way around...
[11:47:26] <taplar> i've used a java library on a scanner before to read a barcode to value, but never in js
[11:47:30] <Cork> lol https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/
[11:47:34] <Cork> well that was hard XD
[11:47:54] <taplar> nyce
[11:48:26] <Cork> i have used https://github.com/Schibum/barcode.js/ to create barcodes, and apparently it can decode too
[11:48:31] <taplar> i guess i shouldn't be surprised, if there are business cases out there.   someon's probably done it already
[12:05:23] <reypm> in a page I have an element with class "date_inputs" and I am accessing it as var el = $(".date_inputs") but if I try el.offset() I got null, why?
[12:07:05] <Cork> reypm: make sure $().length == 1
[12:07:20] <Cork> if it is > 1 you might be checking the wrong element
[12:07:27] <Cork> if it is 0 you didn't catch the element
[12:07:41] <Buoy172> Is it possible to add a resize event on an iframe? I tried but it doesn't seem to trigger.
[12:08:08] <Cork> (and in the first case it can be the element has a display: none parent, that means its position isn't calculated so == null)
[12:08:28] <Cork> Buoy172: resize based on what?
[12:08:38] <Cork> if you mean get an event from the content in the iframe, then no
[12:09:11] <Buoy172> The page within the iframe does some loading and then displays content with different size. It's an external page, of course.
[12:09:30] <Cork> ya, that is a classic problem
[12:09:31] <Buoy172> Cork: I mean the <body> of the iframe changes size
[12:09:49] <Buoy172> can I put an event on iframe's body resize?
[12:10:20] <Cork> Buoy172: if the content is from the _same domain_ and port you can do $('iframe').contents() and add the event handler there
[12:10:31] <Cork> if it is cross domain, well... then it becomes a lot more complicated
[12:10:40] <Buoy172> it's cross domain
[12:11:05] <Cork> then the page inside the iframe has to use postMessage and send the new document height to the wrapping element
[12:11:16] <Cork> the wrapping page can't get it by it self
[12:11:32] <Cork> (this is an intentional restriction by browsers to not leak data)
[12:57:23] <reypm> Cork, thank you is 0 I am investigating why
[12:59:41] <Cork> reypm: might be you run the selector before the element exists in the page
[13:02:45] <reypm> Cork, no, is under $(document).ready() and no the issue is PHP sending some bad data which is making the INPUT to not render properly
[13:03:32] <taplar> running inside document ready doesn't guarentee the element is in the DOM yet, as with elements that are created later with ajax
[13:03:55] <taplar> or created dynamically in general
[13:04:01] <jak2000> Cork and taplar, tanks and scuse me answer at this time, my boss call me... thanks i read about your links.....
[13:04:25] <jak2000> but continue... how to take a photo with jquery? (as i understand, i can decode a jpeg with a codebar).. right?
[13:05:14] <taplar> you'll have to take a look at those libraries Cork linked.  they should have more information in them about how to use them
[13:05:31] <Cork> and it would basically just be to connect them up
[13:05:45] <Cork> they together would do 99.something% of what you want
[13:27:45] <jak2000> ok, much thanks
[13:33:27] <devi8> in jquery, how can I get a list of li elements in reverse order to how they show up on the list?
[13:34:28] <robertmaxrees> devi8 why do you need it backwards? :)
[13:35:14] <devi8> I am wrting a function to slideup the elements of a list in reverse order (unless they have checked input boxes in them)
[13:35:25] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:35:35] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/5347903/923919
[13:35:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably do something like this?
[13:36:24] <Cork> devi8: $('li').reverse() should be enough :)
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> Cork erm
[13:36:51] <devi8> cool. I was doing the "var c=lis.length; while (li.eq(c--)) { do stuff   that's better, thanks
[13:36:57] <robertmaxrees> there's no reverse method tho...
[13:39:26] <Cork> robertmaxrees, devi8: https://jsfiddle.net/5f34ya47/
[13:39:54] <devi8> thanks.
[13:39:55] <robertmaxrees> so literally what I suggested ;)
[13:40:04] <robertmaxrees> convert to array, reverse that.
[13:40:27] <Cork> ya, didn't check the link, thought the array method was exposed on jquery, a few other are
[13:41:45] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:42:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, though it still makes me laugh that those reimplemented methods still do things like flip the order of the args for the callback.
[13:43:21] <Cork> they do?
[13:43:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:43:34] <devi8> if I want to animate the last element (conditionally) first and then the next, do I have to put a pause in the animate loop or string callbacks together to get them to run sequentially?
[13:43:47] <Cork> the ones i think of is litterally just linked to Array.prototype
[13:44:04] <robertmaxrees> Cork ah you're thinking of $.map and $.each
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> I'm talking about the ones in $.fn
[13:44:17] <Cork> no, those are not using array
[13:44:30] <Cork> i was thinking of splice for example
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[13:45:05] <Cork> but ya, $.map and $.each callback arguments are a pain
[13:45:17] <Cork> i have to look it up basically every time i need to use them...
[13:45:55] <robertmaxrees> haha
[13:46:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm so used to the native versions these days.
[13:46:19] <Cork> you mean forEach?
[13:46:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:46:25] <robertmaxrees> and map, etc.
[13:46:41] <Cork> ya, i don't use them much cause of habit though
[13:47:12] <Cork> and there is always some stray visitor using ff 19 or something... *sigh*
[13:47:18] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[13:47:24] <robertmaxrees> we don't worry about those edge cases here/.
[13:47:40] <robertmaxrees> plus babel makes that all moot anyway.
[13:47:45] <robertmaxrees> well, almost all.
[13:48:00] <Cork> ya, we are quite meh, too; but lately there has been a specific user contacting everytime something modern is used
[13:48:17] <Cork> and keeps nagging until we make it backwards compatible
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> what industry are you in??
[13:49:07] <Cork> i work for a hosting company
[13:49:24] <Cork> selling to resellers that well, sit on some weird browsers
[13:49:29] <robertmaxrees> 'cause people will tell us sometimes that something doesn't work and then we find out they're using IE6 and we're just sorta like "Newp"
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> ah
[13:50:13] <Cork> like trying to order a vps from the default browser on windows 2008 server and things like that @_@
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> ah.  yeah, we just evaluate if it's worth it or not.
[13:51:01] <robertmaxrees> which in most cases it wouldn't be.  support costs are real haha
[13:51:11] <Cork> ya, i don't see much value yet in jumping to languages not backwards compatible
[13:51:28] <robertmaxrees> that's why babel exists :)
[13:51:29] <Cork> but i would REALLY like to use let, but i don't want to transcode javascript
[13:51:35] <robertmaxrees> hah
[13:51:36] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[13:51:50] <Cork> i want what i write to be what is served, except for compressed
[13:51:58] <Cork> it makes tracking down errors much simpler
[13:52:07] <robertmaxrees> source maps solve that issue :D
[13:52:12] <Cork> not really
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:52:45] <Cork> if what the converter takes what you wrote as wrongly and the code actually executing does domething else then what you wrote
[13:52:52] <Cork> a source map won't help :)
[13:52:59] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:53:06] <Cork> seen that mostly with coffiescripts though
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not the case any more.
[13:53:24] <robertmaxrees> the source maps we use surface erros within the original, pre-transpiled js.
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> *errors
[13:53:38] <robertmaxrees> instead of post-transpile.
[13:53:39] <Cork> ya, but like i said; currently i don't see the value of doing it
[13:53:42] <devi8> How do I sequentially loop through my list of elements backwards selectively adding an animation to each element?
[13:54:03] <Cork> and when the day comes there is a strong enough value, we will most likely just drop old browser support
[13:54:03] <robertmaxrees> devi8 you can use the reverse() trick and then go from there.
[13:54:18] <devi8> It's the sequentially part.
[13:54:26] <robertmaxrees> you mean animate one at a time?
[13:54:31] <devi8> How do I get one animation to stop then start the next
[13:54:37] <devi8> yep
[13:54:50] <Cork> devi8: you would have to use a callback and in the callback start the next animation then
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/14221047/923919
[13:55:05] <Cork> recursion is your friend in those situations :)
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:58:50] <devi8> thanks guys. I;ll see if I can make that work. Really appreciate your help
[14:16:13] <devi8> once you queue the animations, how to you start the queue? Looking that up now: https://jsfiddle.net/5f34ya47/3/
[14:29:28] <devi8> probably a smart move not to allow comments on the api pages for jquery. the jquery queue doc examples are terrible.
[14:32:14] <devi8> and for everyone that gets on people about not searching google first, there are TONS of bad examples on Google and it is much better to get a professional, responsible response on here than just learn to write terrible code.
[14:33:44] <taplar> all of the api, afaik, is in github, so if you want to suggest improvements you can always fork and offer an update
[14:34:04] <devi8> the api is fine, it's the docs that are not so great.
[14:34:16] <devi8> just on queue...the others have been fine
[14:46:49] <irssi> o/
[14:46:58] <irssi> ya i kno its me
[14:47:05] <irssi> im back
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> slow day today.
[16:17:36] <taplar> yup
[16:19:46] <devi8> is there any way to make this go smoother? It looks great rolling down, but up looks chunky...https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/ZvNZQR?editors=1111
[16:20:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:20:20] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[16:20:37] <devi8> I tried queue about 50 times and finally gave up
[16:20:55] <robertmaxrees> why are you animating them separately and not just the container?
[16:21:14] <devi8> because if one is checked, I don't want it to disappear
[16:21:24] <devi8> check the checkbox and then scroll it up
[16:25:49] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/opVmWd
[16:26:05] <devi8> Here is a better explanation using jquery UI accordion
[16:27:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd use css animations personally.
[16:27:32] <devi8> Yeah. I just don't know how to sequentiall fire them either
[16:27:55] <devi8> other than a timeout loop
[18:37:43] <stephenplatz> What would be some possible causes, or methods to debug, an issue with script execution after inserting a UI dialog with the 'modal' option on a page. Basically, I have another script that appears to stop executing after the modal has been closed, even if I completely destroy the modal on close.
[18:38:39] <taplar> Does the other logic rely upon events?
[18:39:09] <stephenplatz> The other logic has a click handler, yes
[18:39:23] <taplar> You could console log in the handler to see if it is firing at all
[18:39:34] <stephenplatz> It's firing normally
[18:39:36] <taplar> anything that does a lookup you could log the length off of them to see if things are found
[18:40:27] <stephenplatz> I'm not sure I understand that taplar
[18:40:51] <taplar> Anything where you are doing $(someSelector) you can log $(someSelector).length to see if it returns > 0
[18:40:59] <taplar> if zero, the element doesn't exist anymore
[18:41:08] <taplar> *in the DOM
[18:42:06] <taplar> other than legit break points and debugging, various logs to see where logic gets and doesn't get is a solid starting point
[18:42:35] <stephenplatz> Well, the element is still there, it's just not working the way it should. Basically, it's still making and XHR request on click and it's getting the correct response, but that script is failing to do what it's supposed to do, without anything logged, by the way
[18:42:59] <taplar> so then the issue is related to the success method not doing what is expected?
[18:43:10] <stephenplatz> yes
[18:43:24] <taplar> so you've narrowed down your starting scope of were to log things
[18:44:04] <taplar> don't make any assumptions.  verify your assumptions
[18:44:09] <stephenplatz> I guess that's something I'm not sure about
[18:47:03] <taplar> catch you cats later.  gotta restart with security updates.
[19:02:16] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[22:37:09] <gonsays> Hey guys, how can I pass a PHP variable ($var1) to a "file1.js" variable, whereas I declared <script src="file1.js"></script> in the PHP file
[23:17:06] <pavonia> gonsays: Add a JS snippet where you set the JS variable to the PHP value, like "my_var = <? $var1>;" (or what the correct syntax is)
[23:20:41] <gonsays> thnks pavonia :D
