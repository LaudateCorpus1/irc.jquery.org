[03:05:04] <Drizt> Hi. I'm getting a strange behavior when I run a user script in reader mode - the $(document).ready() JQuery event is fired twice. You can test the behavior with the following GM script: https://gist.github.com/elyashiv/0355b426d958d7b66e2f4f173dc494d5
[03:05:08] <Drizt> any idea why this is happening? Is this a bug? Is there a different event I should listen to?
[07:08:51] <Deusdeorum> where am i fucking up this hover? i want the corresponding p element to show when hovering one row https://jsfiddle.net/vLqLj3od/15/
[07:08:52] <Deusdeorum> hovering shows all the p elements
[07:12:23] <Cork> Deusdeorum: you have to select the element close to the hovered element, not all of them
[07:12:42] <Deusdeorum> Cork ah.. wait..
[07:12:51] <Cork> $(this).closest('tr').find('.value-right')
[07:13:54] <Cork> Deusdeorum: also i would recommend using delegate for the hover, instead of binding one event listener (well actually two) for every row
[07:13:56] <Deusdeorum> fuck! you're fast
[07:14:33] <Deusdeorum> never heard about delegate..
[07:15:31] <Cork> $('.termo').on('mouseenter', 'td:nth-child(2)', function() {}).on('mouseleave', 'td:nth-child(2)', function() {})
[07:15:40] <Cork> that binds two event handlers for the entire table
[07:15:46] <Cork> not two for every row
[07:16:45] <Cork> Deusdeorum: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[07:16:54] <Deusdeorum> Thanks a lot Cork
[07:16:57] <Cork> i highly recommend reading up on that
[07:17:08] <Cork> it can make a big difference in dom performance
[07:17:25] <Deusdeorum> Will do. but in short, will page be laggy if not delegating? hence we are delegating events?
[07:17:47] <Cork> Deusdeorum: delegate is fundamantally the same as normal event handlers
[07:18:01] <Cork> Deusdeorum: the difference is you bind it on a parent and listen for bubbling events
[07:18:14] <Cork> it means one event handler can serve multiple elements
[07:18:34] <Deusdeorum> Ah, i see.. thanks again, will read up on posted link!
[07:18:35] <Cork> and as each event handler you add to a dom slows it down a little, it is something you should do when you have many
[07:18:38] <Cork> like ex rows in a table
[07:19:35] <Cork> Deusdeorum: additionally delegated event handlers can catch events from elements that doesn't exist when the handler is bound
[07:19:48] <Cork> Deusdeorum: that is actually the original reason delegated event handlers was created
[07:20:05] * Cork wanders off again
[07:23:05] <Deusdeorum> you're always enlighten me Cork amazing
[10:07:39] <duckgoose> plz help
[10:07:47] <duckgoose> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: div.userlist div.user[nick='bigpresh' i]
[10:07:51] <duckgoose> what am I doing wrong here
[10:09:39] <Cork> duckgoose: make a jsfiddle with the code you're running
[10:11:41] <duckgoose> Cork thats not an easy thing to do
[10:11:55] <Cork> duckgoose: it should be fairly easy
[10:12:18] <Cork> just check what line is causing the error and copy the block around it
[10:12:56] <duckgoose> whats causing the error is the case insensitivity flag
[10:13:10] <duckgoose> when I remove it, the code runs fine
[10:13:33] <Cork> case insensitive flag?
[10:13:43] <Cork> there is no case insensitive flag
[10:13:51] <Cork> this is css, not regex
[10:13:59] <duckgoose> case insensitivity flag "i" in the jquery selector "div.user[nick='bigpresh' i]"
[10:14:07] <Cork> ya, doesn't exist
[10:14:44] <duckgoose> ... you're kidding me right
[10:14:50] <Cork> no
[10:15:25] <Cork> use .filter and js compare if you need case insensitive
[10:15:35] <duckgoose> I think you need to check twice Cork, it very well does exist
[10:15:52] <duckgoose> https://jsfiddle.net/uoxvwxd1/3/ an example of it working
[10:17:15] <duckgoose> I'll seek advice from somewhere more knowledgeable
[10:18:12] <Cork> none of those buttons does anything here...
[10:18:22] <Cork> case insensitive is css4... -_-'
[10:18:32] <Cork> might want to wait for that to stabilize a bit...
[11:33:50] <tau> hi. is it possible to attach a function to a specific set of elements that contains a given class? i wanted to do something like $('.class').each(function() { $(this).fn.new_func...
[17:02:00] <bjerre_> hey guys. Anyone here who's been using d3.js? not the correct place to ask but their channel is dead
[18:42:12] <robsco> if i set an .on('click') hander to an anchor tag, and i call .preventDefault() first, should I still return false to prevent the click?
[18:42:51] <snover> calling preventDefault prevents the default click action, you donâ€™t have to do anything else
[18:43:31] <robsco> is there a preference over returning false or preventingDefault?  simply that the method call is a bit more explicit?
[18:45:04] <snover> you should call preventDefault.
[18:45:41] <robsco> why?
[18:45:52] <snover> because returning false is non-standard
[18:46:08] <robsco> ok, should i return anything?
[18:46:22] <snover> and in jquery, unless something has changed that i am unaware of (which is possible, but not super likely), returning false cancels the default *and* stops propagation
[18:46:47] <robsco> ahhh ok, that makes sense
[20:19:56] <RM982> "closest() For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element"  ...what is supposed to be "the set"
[20:23:10] <RM982> is not the whole DOM right?
[21:06:49] <SimpleName>  I am looking for some pie chartjs like this http://imgur.com/a/jwph4, but I need free javascript  plugin
[21:15:08] <SimpleName> or like this http://imgur.com/a/u1cZZ, but need to opensource
[23:13:20] <Timesheet> How to pass a non-unique DOM object into a function?
[23:13:50] <Timesheet> for example - I have a page that list out all the user and create a button to delete user for each. How to make each delete button delete only that user?
[23:14:23] <Timesheet> using MongoDB, have the delete function set up, and it takes in the id_ of the user which I could write to the DOM in hidden field
