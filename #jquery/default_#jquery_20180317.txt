[02:28:20] <jak2000> hi all
[02:28:34] * hakerx1 Yawn.
[02:28:45] <BillyZane> hello
[02:29:22] <jak2000> anyone used jquery autocomplete?
[03:23:47] <joobz> hi guys
[03:24:32] <joobz> say i have <div id="moo"><span id="baa"></span></div> how can i select the <span>, but also reference the div in the selector
[05:23:51] <jak2000> anyone here know about java?
[10:17:31] <Neo4> how get xpath to selected jquery element?
[10:19:39] <Woet> Neo4: what did you google for so far?
[10:19:47] <Woet> Neo4: what did you find so far? what did you try so fra?
[10:19:51] <Woet> far *
[10:20:06] <Neo4> I googled
[10:20:42] <Neo4> Couldn't have found simple decision
[10:20:51] <Neo4> Woet: what do you advise?
[10:21:38] <Woet> Neo4: what are you trying to do?
[10:21:40] <Neo4> Woet: I'm going to create scraper that will get xpath from iframe and save it to database, than will use in php function xpath and extract data from html
[10:21:56] <Neo4> Woet: wp plugin for codecanyon
[10:21:58] <Woet> Neo4: oh right, you're the scraper guy. cya.
[10:22:13] <Woet> Neo4: as I recommended before, find a legitimate job instead. thanks.
[10:22:35] <Neo4> Woet: it is my big comersial project, I'm going earn 100 000 500 000$
[10:22:57] <Neo4> Woet: why it is not legal?
[10:23:20] <Neo4> Woet: make scripts for codecanyon and sell is not ligal?
[10:23:48] <Neo4> Woet: this plugin make me rich :)
[10:23:56] <Neo4> I will like Tramp
[10:25:11] <Neo4> Woet: and how to translate?
[10:25:41] <Neo4> Woet: manually write own function?
[10:26:21] <Neo4> Woet: do you know php well? What is version xpath use DOMDocument class?
[10:26:41] <Neo4> Woet: by the way
[10:34:19] <Neo4> Woet: I think better use only php? We can send ajax request with data and return calculated xpath by php, that we don't need worry about compatibility
[10:35:02] <Neo4> Woet: it will much slower of course. and better calcullate using javascript
[12:57:45] <Neo4> I want to create button when user press on this button there is textarea and I can get position of cursore in textarea and put there something
[12:58:00] <Neo4> never work with cursor
[13:18:18] <Neo4> jquery doesn't have functions for work with text?
[13:18:36] <Neo4> it need to do use javascript?
[13:25:43] <Cork> Neo4: jquery is for dom modifications, and jquery is javascript...
[13:25:52] <Cork> so yes, you need to use javascript
[13:26:07] <Neo4> ok, I can extand jquery
[13:27:27] <Neo4> jQuery.fn.extend({ this is use for to create new plugins?
[13:28:03] <Cork> or just 4.fn.thePlugin = function() {}
[13:28:05] <Cork> opps
[13:28:09] <Cork> or just $.fn.thePlugin = function() {}
[13:28:58] <Cork> extend basically only makes sense if you want to add multiple functions directly on the jqeury prototype
[13:32:45] <Neo4> ok
[13:33:12] <Neo4> Cork: and I need call only with selector?
[13:33:28] <Neo4> $('selector').alert(); and I can't $.alert()
[13:33:44] <Neo4> my function
[13:33:44] <Neo4> jQuery.fn.extend({
[13:33:44] <Neo4>       alert: function(){
[13:33:44] <Neo4>         alert('hello');
[13:33:44] <Neo4>       }
[13:33:44] <Neo4>     })
[13:34:09] <Cork> Neo4: for $.fn ya, else you want to add it directly on the jquery object $.utilityPlugin = function() {}
[13:34:33] <Cork> Neo4: also you should each loop in the function (alert in this case)
[13:34:59] <Cork> alert: function() { this.each(function() { console.log('hello'); }) }
[13:35:11] <Neo4> why?
[13:35:21] <Cork> cause it can be multiple matched elements
[13:35:26] <Neo4> ok
[13:35:27] <Cork> $('*')
[13:35:57] <Cork> unless you want to do something on all the matched elements in one go that is
[13:36:05] <Cork> like this.hide()
[13:36:19] <Neo4> and if without extend use jQuery.fn=function don't need loop?
[13:36:20] <Neo4> ok
[13:36:41] <Neo4> understood, it function apply for one elemend, (id) we don't use look if for classes use loop
[13:37:16] <Cork> doesn't matter
[13:37:35] <Cork> jquery doesn't make a difference for if you match one or multiple elements
[13:37:49] <Cork> so if you do NOT use .each in the plugin you are creating a broken plugin
[13:38:06] <Neo4> ok, will use
[13:38:10] <Neo4> :)
[13:38:31] <Neo4> I used create class, instead function
[13:39:47] <Neo4> need to create folder javascript and there put files named ClassName.js, and then when it will need easy go to folder and find
[14:17:05] <Neo4> I see we use get() for get object class Element
[14:17:52] <Neo4> that we can work like with javascript object that is got by function getElementById
[14:19:44] <Neo4> I'm goign to create javascript class that will handle form's input fields
[14:21:57] <Neo4> class TextInserter{}. Soon I'll show you for estimate, whether I did right or not.
[14:37:33] <Cork> Neo4: why do you need to create an object for handling text insertion?
[14:37:46] <Cork> just do the modification on the dom element
[14:38:12] <Neo4> Cork: for reuse next time, I will store it in folder like class
[14:38:14] <Cork> if you needed to keep a state i could understand it, but for inserting text?
[14:38:31] <Cork> Neo4: so just create it as a plugin that extends jquery
[14:38:40] <Cork> no point in having a full separate object for it
[14:38:51] <Neo4> wait I did almost, soon show, it is very easy
[14:39:08] <Cork> and very unneeded
[14:39:09] <Neo4> I read advise always do everything in OOP
[14:39:17] <Cork> uhh...
[14:39:18] <Neo4> simply want to follow OOP style
[14:39:27] <Neo4> not function, always class
[14:39:32] <Cork> O_o'
[14:39:51] <Cork> you've read something you shouldn't have i sounds like...
[14:40:25] <Cork> so create a class to modify an external objects public methods makes no sense
[14:40:26] <Neo4> this for increase developing performance, I'm very slow developer
[14:40:29] <Cork> unless you need to keep state
[14:40:48] <Cork> it will slow down performance by quite a bit
[14:41:06] <Cork> and ya, if you create everything as a contrsuctor/class i can see why it takes time
[14:41:31] <Cork> (and memory)
[14:41:42] <Neo4> yes, my shitty project for a while not require high performance.
[14:42:01] <Neo4> wait I put here link on class a few minutes
[14:42:31] <Neo4> in two variants jquery plugin and like class
[14:42:36] <Cork> Neo4: creating a constructor to have a function to set three values on a thid object, it NOT making it more performant
[14:43:06] <Neo4> Cork: here anyway all passed by reference
[14:43:12] <Cork> that is the opposite of what you're doing
[14:43:29] <Neo4> now users have very powerful computers and it should be work fast
[14:43:42] <Neo4> problem can be with mobile devices
[15:08:11] <Neo4> Cork: see I did, it works perfectly https://gist.github.com/kselax/84a305ae2f4d5d81350ddb7a7596fed5
[15:08:23] <Neo4> put text like I need
[15:09:03] <Neo4> now I'll try do it like jquery plugin, but I don't know how pass second parameter
[15:09:19] <Neo4> selector is this, and text
[15:20:06] <Neo4> Who know how get parameter in jquery plugins https://gist.github.com/kselax/62e2cf2be10a1b9c8bae369e0d627c37
[15:20:35] <Neo4> $('textarea').JqTexInserter('some text'); How get 'some text' ?
[15:22:05] <Neo4> there https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#accepting-options
[15:42:01] <Neo4> Have already done https://gist.github.com/kselax/62e2cf2be10a1b9c8bae369e0d627c37
[15:42:05] <Neo4> works
[15:42:14] <Neo4> but like class much better look
[15:49:04] <Neo4> both variant https://gist.github.com/kselax/d057ef90c3fe4541f07612dcc25b0f0c
