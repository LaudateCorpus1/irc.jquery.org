[05:22:21] <jhave> Hello
[05:23:10] <jhave> I need a hint to how to do this
[05:24:49] <jhave> I have a table where i need to get pushed to all users who is on the page
[05:25:13] <jhave> so if a user name an update to it all other users get the update
[05:25:22] <jhave> How do i handle it?
[05:32:55] <Cork> jhave: websocket or comet or longpull
[05:33:28] <Cork> websocekt has the advantage that you can push the data comet and longpull is pulling solutions where you answer a request from the browser "new changes"
[05:34:08] <jhave> ok maybe websockets is the way :D
[05:34:20] <jhave> Its for a seat map to a netparty
[05:37:00] <Cork> jhave: if the server doesn't have to be involved you could look at webrtc
[05:37:14] <Cork> then clients can talk with each other
[05:49:32] <jhave> Core, is there a special websocket there is a good to use like socket.io  ?
[05:53:43] <Cork> jhave: the most complicated part is the server side
[05:54:09] <Cork> jhave: you have to have something that can keep a constant connection going (as far as i know it rules out php for example)
[05:54:17] <Cork> personally i do it in go
[05:54:49] <Cork> client side you can use socket.io if you like, but it is fairly straight forward so you can do it directly if you like (no lib needed)
[05:55:36] <jhave> ok thanks :)
[05:55:40] <Cork> np
[05:56:05] <Cork> if you go with golang i can recommend the gorilla framework

[15:34:59] <Murda> If I have function and inside that function im jQuery.each looping, how can I directly break out of function
[15:35:14] <Neo1> hi guys!
[15:36:19] <Neo1> I got today a few ideas...
[15:36:26] <Neo1> about performance
[15:36:33] <Neo1> who want speak about this?
[15:37:53] <Neo1> I think about creating my own framework
[15:38:14] <Neo1> is someone here who interesting this theme?
[15:38:59] <Neo1> this theme is very intimate)))
[15:54:01] <pavonia> Murda: You can do "return false;" in the each() handler to exit it prematurely
[15:56:42] <Murda> pavonia: return false only seems to exit from loop, but not function
[15:58:25] <pavonia> So you want to break the loop and then the function too, otherwise run an additional part of the function?
[16:01:19] <Murda> pavonia: yes, i want to break out from loop and function all together
[16:03:58] <pavonia> Murda: I think the only way is to set a variable to a special value if the loop was has ended prematurely, and check for this value after the each()
[16:08:52] <Neo1> pavonia: hey hello babe ;)
[16:08:58] <Neo1> pavonia: I recalled you
[16:09:30] <Neo1> pavonia: which framework do you use? Do you have your own framework?
[16:23:03] <Neo1> pavonia: ;)
[16:23:11] <Neo1> pavonia: :) :) :)
[16:23:22] <Neo1> pavonia: :p
[16:23:31] <Neo1> ))))
[21:13:40] <MiWebTechX2> I'm trying to make items draggable and resizable but proportional to each others sizes.
[21:13:48] <MiWebTechX2> Is this possible ? Example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45903727/resize-all-elements-to-fit-parent-when-one-element-is-resized-in-jquery
[21:14:25] <MiWebTechX2> and not overlap
