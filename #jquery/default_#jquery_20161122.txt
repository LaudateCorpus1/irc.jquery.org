[00:22:44] <tash> so, NaN means not a number ... but how to you validate whether the input is empty (thus returning NaN) and alert the user?
[00:23:01] <tash> I can't seem to figure out the if condition to check if the input field is blank. I dont' want to allow it to be left blank
[00:26:16] <Forbidd3n> tash: did you search for this? I did and it was the 4th option down - https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isNumeric/
[00:26:35] <Forbidd3n> sorry 3rd option down - https://www.google.com/#q=how+to+check+for+NaN+in+jquery
[00:39:24] <tash> Yes, I did...and I thought I tried that. I'll try again
[00:59:14] <itsgokul> TypeError: $(...).stacktable is not a function why
[01:20:39] <Cork> itsgokul: you haven't loaded the stacktable plugin before trying to call it
[01:20:48] <itsgokul> yes
[01:42:23] <Velizar> I just migrated to jQuery 3.1 from 1 (latest), and my Google Maps broke (TypeError: a is not null). Is there a known incompatibility between jQuery 3 and Google Maps?
[01:43:46] <Cork> google doesn't use jquery
[01:44:05] <Cork> you would have to show where this comes from
[01:45:11] <Velizar> It's probably my own code. Pages without maps are broken.
[01:45:24] <Velizar> s/probably/certainly
[02:04:54] <Velizar> Ok, my old code used $(".controllerName.method").ready(function1); but jQuery 3 no longer supports that syntax. Is there a direct replacement? Or should I instead use $(function1) and inside function1, return if $(".controllerName.method") doesn't exist?
[02:07:30] <systemfault> .ready only works on the document...
[02:07:46] <systemfault> Not sure why that weird code was written :P
[02:08:33] <Velizar> Because Rails with Turbolinks. All JS was loaded in every page. I needed a separate initializer for separate pages.
[02:30:00] <itsgokul> how can i use multiple table header on stack table <tr><th></th></tr> <tr><th></th></tr> ?
[02:36:30] <Cork> itsgokul: haven't used the lib, but you might be able to use thead
[02:59:32] <rhizome> you mean like rowspan?
[02:59:59] <Cork> prob want two rows and col span on the first row
[03:41:57] <itsgokul> how can i remove stacktable when i hit javascript print button   $('#simple-example-table').stacktable();
[03:45:19] <Cork> itsgokul: you would have to check there documentation
[03:45:33] <Cork> the answer might be that you "can't" and have to reload the page
[03:45:40] <Cork> but the answer depends on the plugin
[03:56:26] <itsgokul> :(
[04:04:52] <Velizar> Is it possible to get jQuery UI 1.11.4 running with jQuery 3.1.0, or do i HAVE to use a newer version to make it work? I'm having issues with sortable.on('sortupdate'), the second argument it passes to the callback isn't right.
[04:08:44] <Cork> Velizar: ui have a "works with" reference
[04:08:55] <Cork> and yes you normally have to update ui if you update jquery
[04:09:46] <Velizar> The migration code warned me about jQuery.fn.offset(), which is used in jQuery UI
[04:10:57] <Cork> Velizar: that said, as long as you don't jump too far in versions it normally doesn't cause much breakage
[04:11:20] <Cork> though i think they did some fairly big changes around autocomplete recently
[04:56:21] <Squarism> if i want to do a synchronous "rest" request to the server serving my html/js in jquery - what to use?
[04:56:41] <Cork> you never want to do a sync request
[04:56:46] <Cork> it freezes the browser
[04:57:27] <Squarism> Cork: in "onbeforeunload" i want to block until my server answers me if i can leave the page or not
[04:57:43] <Cork> Squarism: onbeforeunload isn't supported cross browser
[04:57:53] <Cork> and is possible to ignore in many others
[04:58:01] <Cork> exactly cause too many sites abuse it like that
[04:58:30] <Squarism> ok.. now im curious "onbeforeunload isn't supported cross browser"
[04:58:55] <Cork> opera never implemented it cause it is user hostile
[04:59:05] <Cork> and firefox has options to ignore the event handler
[04:59:14] <Squarism> its in firefox, chrome and ie
[04:59:37] <Cork> i think safari is thinking about dropping it (and so is firefox)
[05:00:03] <Squarism> well this is for medical forms used on hospitals - its a good function for us
[05:00:18] <Cork> no, it is an easy hack for you
[05:00:28] <Cork> there are good options to do it right
[05:00:36] <Squarism> Cork, like?
[05:00:43] <Cork> websocket for example
[05:01:01] <Cork> it has a constant connection and you get a connection lost/closed when the user leaves
[05:01:28] <Cork> the user won't have to connect and tell you cause you will know
[05:01:51] <Cork> (i uses it for that exact case my self, though i added the support for push notifications)
[05:04:29] <Squarism> i heard websockets arent mature enough yet. Having issues with proxies and such
[05:04:39] <Cork> uh... no
[05:04:52] <Cork> it was explicitly implemented to not have problems with proxies
[05:05:00] <Squarism> oh ok
[05:05:03] <Cork> it uses normal port 80/433
[05:05:06] <Cork> *443
[05:05:21] <Cork> what might be a problem is keep alive time
[05:05:37] <Cork> but that is just that the server needs to sends them often enough to keep the proxy connection open
[05:05:38] <Squarism> well, i heard this from a high profile guy in functional programming world
[05:05:47] <Squarism> cant judge its validity
[05:06:04] <Cork> well we have it in production and had no proxy problems yet
[05:06:20] <Cork> (except for under the development time)
[05:06:29] <Cork> there are problems with http2 though
[05:06:41] <Cork> mainly they didn't leave any space for it in the new spec :/
[05:14:17] <Squarism> Ok.. so there does not exist a synchronous "http get" in jquery then?
[05:14:53] <Squarism> (sticking with the plan cus i wont have time to persue the "right" approach)
[05:23:35] <Cork> Squarism: it exists in 1.x and 2.x but it is deprecated and removed in 3.x
[05:23:58] <Cork> and it has been strongly discouraged for many years
[05:24:06] <Cork> (many many years)
[07:29:14] <midori-rus> Hello there. Is it possible to switch element's classes using toggleClass()? The problem that there are 2 classes in element, but I want to switch one of them. For example: class="fa fa-bars" to class="fa fa-times" ?
[08:08:50] <lemonsparrow> how to remove all <tr> after <thead>
[08:09:05] <Cork> you can't have tr after thead
[08:09:15] <Cork> so it isn't possible to remove them
[08:09:34] <Cork> the only thing that can be after thead is tbody or tfoot
[08:10:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I get it but Im building one intentionally like that.. is there a way to remove it ?
[08:10:30] <Cork> lemonsparrow: append it to the page and it will be moved into the tbody
[08:10:43] <Cork> or is it the parser that does that...
[08:10:54] <Cork> anyway if it really is after the thead (you have to verify this)
[08:11:07] <Cork> just do thead.siblings('tr').remove()
[08:11:46] <Cork> (and also you should fix your code to use tbody instead of the broken markup)
[08:12:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thead.siblings('tr').remove() can u show right way.. I mean what do I taregt ? I tried this $('table#wtrans_return > thead > tr').not(':first').remove(); but doesnt work
[08:12:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: thead is the thead dom element
[08:12:37] <Cork> wrapped in jquery
[08:12:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no selector ?
[08:12:53] <Cork> depends if it is in the page or not
[08:13:04] <Cork> that is why i didn't specify, cause i don't know
[08:13:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork: its like inside table I have <thead><tr> </thead><tr> <tr> </table>
[08:13:45] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also thead > tr will find the tr's inside the thead
[08:13:46] <lemonsparrow> thykka: I want to remove all tr after thead
[08:13:46] <Cork> not after
[08:14:00] <slax0r> why don't you fix your markup instead?!
[08:14:13] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that line doesn't help answering my questions
[08:14:20] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to remove all tr after thead as I mentioned.. Im sure there should be some way right ?
[08:14:25] <Cork> ...
[08:14:31] <Cork> just do thead.siblings('tr').remove() <--
[08:14:38] <Cork> i answered it
[08:14:49] <hellyeah> find thead and get the singlings and remove it
[08:14:55] <lemonsparrow>  Uncaught ReferenceError: thead is not defined(â€¦)
[08:14:59] <MikeD_> siblings would remove BEFORE as well
[08:15:07] <lemonsparrow> MikeD_: nothing before
[08:15:08] <hellyeah> is there other child of thead besides tr?
[08:15:19] <lemonsparrow> hellyeah: nope
[08:16:09] <slax0r> dude... thead.siblings('tr') where thead is the dom element obtained through a selector
[08:16:15] <lemonsparrow> https://jsbin.com/tugewac/edit?html,js,output how to do this in jquery ?
[08:16:16] <slax0r> you can't just copy paste stuff and hope it will work
[08:16:18] <hellyeah> lemonsparrow:  did you fiddle it?
[08:16:19] <slax0r> use some common sense
[08:16:23] <slax0r> think what you're doing...
[08:16:26] <MikeD_> haha
[08:16:37] <hellyeah> or jsbin
[08:17:22] <hellyeah> :D
[08:17:27] <hellyeah> why do you want to remove tr in thead? lemonsparrow
[08:17:36] <lemonsparrow> hellyeah: worked $('table#wtrans_return > thead').siblings('tr').remove() :)
[08:18:09] <slax0r> that is your thead.siblings('tr').reove()
[08:18:12] <hellyeah> good
[08:18:14] <slax0r> remove*
[08:18:17] <slax0r> congrats
[08:19:25] <lemonsparrow> :)
[08:26:34] <Cork> also... $('table#wtrans_return')
[08:26:36] <Cork> sigh...
[08:26:49] <Cork> where are ppl getting the idea of having to set a tag name before ids...
[08:26:51] <Cork> i don't get it
[08:30:36] <slax0r> Cork: because people are using IDs on multiple elements...
[08:42:36] <MikeD_> id on multiple elements is wronger than tag names before id :)
[08:43:11] <slax0r> tag names before id is not wrong, just not necesarry, id on multiple elements is wrong :P
[08:43:57] <MikeD_> yeah that's more technically accurate to say it that way
[09:11:25] <WilsonG> hi scripters
[10:13:25] <jonah> Hi is anybody any good here with jquery? For some reason my slider is just staying on the first slide and not going to the next ones: http://www.dottiesevents.co.uk/
[10:18:11] <FilipNortic_> jonah: you have a typeerror in there
[10:21:49] <jonah> FilipNortic_: hi thanks it looks like it is this: <script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript">addFieldToCheck("email","Email address");</script>
[10:25:07] <FilipNortic_> you might want to use push instead of array[array.length]=val
[10:25:17] <FilipNortic_> that seems really odd
[10:26:07] <jonah> FilipNortic_: it's from my phplist mailing list. It says to add this script before the form: http://pastebin.com/GKStEQ7k
[10:26:23] <jonah> FilipNortic_: but when I do then I get other errors! and the site doesn't render right too in the footer...
[10:27:57] <FilipNortic_> let's hope they know what they doing, cause i wouldn't wanna debug that
[10:29:13] <jonah> FilipNortic_: I've taken out the CheckEmail part and now it renders ok - but my slider still won't work. I've got v.easing[this.easing] is not a function now too!
[10:29:37] <jonah> FilipNortic_: jquery.min.js line 2 col 87786...
[10:34:04] <MassDebates> Howdy
[10:35:42] <MassDebates> I have a PDF form that has traditionally been printed out, but I think I'd like to make it available on portable devices. Mobile would be nice, but tablet is really the focus for me. Aside from simple form elements, I require the ability to modify the contents of a table, add a signature, and run totals for some numbers. (It's a sales order form)
[10:36:22] <FilipNortic_> jonah: my bet would be a version miss match betwwen jQuery and the plugin
[10:36:44] <MassDebates> My first thought is that I could use jquery to help me do some of the heavy lifting. It doesn't need to be available on the internt; I'm perfectly fine with making it contain a folder with any/all dependencies/libraries req'd.
[10:37:05] <jonah> FilipNortic_: ah thanks got it fired up now - I just needed jquery UI too!
[10:37:13] <jonah> FilipNortic_: thanks for taking the time to help me :)
[10:37:36] <MassDebates> My biggest thing is that like, -really- old guys are going to be using this thing. They've done other stuff with interactive maps that I've made for them in the past but I was wondering if I could have some tips with this.
[10:37:50] <FilipNortic_> jonah: that would have been my second guess. Trouble was that there where many versions of your slider
[10:38:16] <jonah> FilipNortic_: well thanks again
[10:38:17] <MassDebates> They're getting pretty good but i don't want to toss them something more than they can chew.
[10:38:30] <MassDebates> Anything I should keep in mind when putting this together?
[10:38:46] <FilipNortic_> MassDebates: are you talking about filling in a pdf form?
[10:39:15] <MassDebates> Aye. IT guy sent out pdf form to sales guys. They can't use it. Cumbersome and it erases itself
[10:40:14] <MassDebates> My first thought with the table specifically is that I could make my own div table setup, throw inputs, use a plugin to handle the signature, and call it a day by slapping a folder in their tablets that holds the necessary js files and whatnot, link to it from a static HTML page, and let them save copies of it
[10:40:26] <MassDebates> Feels like this is a bad idea, so I figured I'd jump on here and ask around.
[10:40:36] <MassDebates> No sense in wasting time with the wrong direction
[10:42:05] <FilipNortic_> well if you want to generate a pdf from js you should be able to... But get js to interact with an existing pdf from might be trickier
[10:42:31] <MassDebates> Yeah. That's why I'm thinnking I can use a webpage, fill out a webform within that webpage, and save a copy of the webpage with the filled out form
[10:42:34] <MassDebates> What'dya think?
[10:44:08] <FilipNortic_> if you finnish the backend that interacts with the pdf form the rest is easy...
[10:44:40] <FilipNortic_> but i can't really tell you what that would be.
[10:45:00] <MassDebates> That sounds like it'd be harder than what I was suggesting.
[10:45:03] <MassDebates> Am I misunderstanding?
[10:46:01] <MassDebates> i mean I can just make a PDF from the completed/saved webpage's form
[10:46:19] <MassDebates> I'm trying to make the best user interface to accomplish what I've mentioned previously.
[10:47:00] <FilipNortic_> so a static webpage with form validation?
[10:47:46] <MassDebates> Sure, but submit saves a copy of the webpage as it is, with form inputted values (by the user) still intact.
[10:48:40] <FilipNortic_> so ajax?
[10:51:36] <MassDebates> Yep
[10:51:42] <MassDebates> Thouts?
[10:51:44] <MassDebates> thoughts?*
[10:51:49] <MassDebates> warnings?caveats?
[10:56:05] <wdz> hello everyone, how can i find all buttons of submit type with style not none?
[10:56:21] <wdz> i tried : $('form').find('button[type="submit"][style*!="none"]') but it's not good syntax
[11:04:28] <wdz> found it! thank you
[11:14:53] <hhee> hey! guys. does jquery UI current (1.12.1) work nice with latest jquery 3.1.1?
[11:16:09] <hhee> do you use jquery UI? i need mostly for tabs functions (tabs on page). can i create them only with pure jquery?
[11:47:19] <qakhan> hi all, i am trying to toggle class between multipule table first row
[11:47:34] <qakhan> here is my code https://jsfiddle.net/vvmzq9c0/1/
[11:58:06] <jt0r> How can I sign the jsfoundation CLA?
[11:58:40] <robertmaxrees> Try in #jquery-dev
[11:58:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:58:49] <jt0r> thanks
[12:00:13] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask btw?
[12:00:33] <robertmaxrees> ah
[12:01:13] <jt0r> I've actually got a patch for dojo, but since dojo is now part of the jsfoundation I need to sign the new CLA but I can't actually work out how to sign it :|
[12:01:52] <jt0r> I tried over at http://js.foundation/CLA/
[12:01:56] <robertmaxrees> yeah - something tells me things are still kind up being worked on.
[12:02:16] <robertmaxrees> did you already submit the PR btw?
[12:02:27] <jt0r> if you refresh that page it should load. github has some issues at the moment
[12:02:42] <jt0r> Nope, I wanted to sign the CLA first
[12:02:51] <robertmaxrees> i might submit it anyway just to get some eyes on it.
[12:27:55] <frankiee_> Hi! Anybody know of a way to select all checkboxes on a page?
[12:28:33] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> note: that can be kind of slow depending on your page.
[12:52:10] <wdz> guys, what's the best way to click submit button in some form on keypress event in textarea?
[12:52:50] <robertmaxrees> why would you click the submit button?
[12:52:54] <robertmaxrees> why not just submit the form?
[12:52:57] <wdz> $(event.target).parents("form:first").find("button:visible").click() is not working..
[12:53:31] <wdz> button has onclick event and I have several of these so I want to unify the script
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't refactor a little?
[12:54:09] <wdz> what do you mean by refactor?
[12:54:20] <robertmaxrees> change that code to be bound to the form submit instead of the button click.
[12:55:16] <wdz> it seems like I will have to, but I don't want to because I use this opensource platform and don't want to change core files every little (when updates are available)
[12:55:34] <robertmaxrees> oh what?
[12:55:36] <robertmaxrees> gross.
[12:55:42] <wdz> true :D
[12:55:53] <robertmaxrees> either way, .closest('form').find('button') should work fine.
[12:56:44] <wdz> i used $(event.target).parent("form").find('button[type="submit"]:visible:first')
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> without seeing html it's hard to help fwiw.
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> also: are hyou using .trigger()?
[12:57:57] <robertmaxrees> or...?
[12:58:05] <robertmaxrees> a little more would be helpful here.
[12:58:09] <wdz> i am not using trigger just .click()
[12:58:22] <robertmaxrees> same diff.
[12:58:27] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[12:58:32] <robertmaxrees> show the html.
[12:59:10] <wdz> was never good with fiddle but i'll try
[13:00:28] <wdz> guess what :D your code works :-O
[13:03:27] <wdz> thank you very much robertmaxrees
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:08:00] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:14:02] <syntax> hello. im searching something like an garage door menu like that one -> https://css-tricks.com/examples/GarageDoorMenu . but i want to use that for an landing page. my goal is to split the screen at 50%-vertical (full-screen and responsive) to let the user choose between those 2 "doors" to enter 1 of 2 forums. does someone have an idear if there is something like that out there already?
[13:15:00] <MassDebates> You can easily make this with #CSS and skip #jquery entirely
[13:15:03] <MassDebates> @ syntax
[13:15:11] <syntax> that would be nice too
[13:15:25] <syntax> in my example there is already a solution without jq
[13:15:58] <MassDebates> Then whence calleth for thine entry into #jquery, friend?
[13:16:14] <syntax> MassDebates: but yes, you help me to determine if i need jquery or if i can realise it without on a css native
[13:16:29] <MassDebates> You can make it with pure CSS>
[13:16:37] <robertmaxrees> as the example already shows :)
[13:17:14] <MassDebates> hm, was my ol'e engrish language accurate?
[13:17:22] <MassDebates> I shall delve into unnecessary research mode!
[13:17:31] <syntax> all those changes i need to do is native css. god
[13:17:39] <MassDebates> what's wrong with that?
[13:17:48] <MassDebates> jquery's like, super close to CSS in some respects.
[13:17:55] <MassDebates> Like
[13:17:56] <MassDebates> Really close.
[13:18:01] <syntax> nono, dont missunderstand me. im happy about that
[13:18:08] <MassDebates> We're talking 2 secret lovers meeting on a nightly basis close.
[13:18:55] <MassDebates> syntax: perhaps it may help to explain what troubles you're having, exactly?
[13:19:21] <MassDebates> syntax:  Or if you prefer, I can come up with more analogies of the close relationship between CSS and jquery on certain points?
[13:19:44] <syntax> in that example there is jquery too.. thats what confused me
[13:19:58] <syntax> look in the source.
[13:20:31] <MassDebates> Why not pop open a codepen, crank out 2 block links, make them cover 50% and 50% (respectively) of their parent container, and then make that parent container the viewport?
[13:20:41] <syntax> that jquery.backgroundPosition.js
[13:21:14] <MassDebates> If you do that, I bet I can bribe robertmaxrees to help you with the hover garage door effect in exchange for some swanky tree puns
[13:21:21] <MassDebates> Does that sound... oak-kay to you?
[13:21:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:21:27] <MassDebates> D'ohohohoh.
[13:21:27] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[13:21:38] <syntax> MassDebates: yes it does
[13:21:39] <robertmaxrees> leaf me be gosh.
[13:21:59] <MassDebates> syntax:  Go for it. He may even help you branch out to jquery.
[13:22:00] <syntax> robertmaxrees: you laugh about me? :(
[13:22:24] <MassDebates> syntax:  No, he's making fun of me. He thinks I'm not worthy of the cool kids club.
[13:22:47] <MassDebates> syntax:  Go on! Codepen time! http://codepen.io/pen/ <--- make your links!
[13:23:23] <syntax> jsfiddle also ok?
[13:23:28] <MassDebates> As long as you're steadfast in your foundational roots of CSS, you should be fine. jsfiddle is good, too.
[13:23:48] <MassDebates> And make sure to use miracle grow.
[13:23:57] <MassDebates> (idk, I'm running out of puns)
[13:33:38] <MassDebates> syntax:  you still alive? Need a hand?
[13:35:29] <syntax> MassDebates: yes im alive. preparing a fiddle
[13:35:50] <MassDebates> Very good sir. I will have an example at the ready for you for your cross-reference to see how different our animmals are

[13:40:34] <Sayona> Hello
[13:41:09] <MassDebates> syntax:  Are you ready yet?
[13:41:27] <MassDebates> syntax:  If so, here's an example of the viewport being split into two. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jVmrrM
[13:41:59] <Sayona> Hi, can anyone help me with something, I have this code http://pastebin.ca/3741371 I want use jquery when I click on <div id="modulsigla"> to check the radio botton
[13:42:11] <MassDebates> Woops!
[13:43:09] <MassDebates> Re-saved. my bad.
[13:43:35] <MassDebates> It's not really important how you lay them out, but this will give you an easier way to set up the container interaction with the garage door effect.
[13:45:04] <syntax> ok
[13:46:35] <MassDebates> Okay, let's see yours.
[13:46:54] <Sayona> :(
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> Sayona what's up?
[13:47:52] <robertmaxrees> Sayona i don't see any JSin there.
[13:47:58] <robertmaxrees> also: you can't repeat IDs.
[13:48:04] <Sayona> I don't have one..
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> Sayona oh.
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out learn.jquery.com in that case :)
[13:49:12] <Sayona> thanks
[13:49:52] <MassDebates> syntax:  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pNPbPP Here's what I was envisioning, really.
[13:51:18] <syntax> hm, i see
[13:52:13] <syntax> im thinking about mobile rdy
[13:52:29] <syntax> but should be fine
[13:53:45] <MassDebates> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pNPbPP If you're thinking about mobile, I would wonder how you're planning having users enjoy the hover effect.
[13:54:10] <MassDebates> ^ This now has labels, for that case. Not every user will know to hold down their finger.
[13:54:14] <syntax> im planing about a fallback to an other solution
[13:55:05] <MassDebates> Or, better yet, skip the garage door effect since it's terrible for UI, delays user access to their desired goal, and just give your poor audience some straight-up links to click for their convenience, since that's probably what you should do.

[13:55:49] <syntax> ye but my fkn m8's r dumb^^
[13:56:15] <syntax> but you r right
[13:56:35] <MassDebates> Can't help but think that this is one of those cases where "my m8s" is hidden code for "my own desire to have something flashy"
[13:57:06] <syntax> :)
[14:01:24] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees:  So how's about I exchange some tree puns for some free guidance on setting up a webform involving jquery? Sales guys want a way to take a Sales Order form on their tablet to a customer and have them populate/filll it and sign it right  on the device.
[14:01:59] <MikeD_> how many puns?
[14:02:03] <MassDebates> 16.
[14:02:05] <MikeD_> "tree"
[14:02:12] <MassDebates> LOL
[14:02:17] <MassDebates> Damn, I shoulda said that.
[14:03:14] <MassDebates> Right now it's a PDF and they're going through hell to fill it out, save, etc... I figured leveraging HTML will allow me to have the heavy lifting done (the PDF has a table and a signature spot) by jquery
[14:03:20] <MikeD_> how much is it gonna cost?  "Tree fiddy"
[14:03:45] <MikeD_> ew, pdf suck
[14:04:27] <robertmaxrees> sorry, just saw this.
[14:04:57] <robertmaxrees> Aaaand i have no idea tbh.  I might look into a simple drawing library for the signature part.
[14:06:34] <MikeD_> do you really need a "signature" - or is pressing submit acknowledgement enough?  (assuming you're going to send an email confirmation for double-opt-in anyway)
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> really depends on what your lawyer says.
[14:08:19] <MikeD_> given the "signature" at point of sale on touch screens, you probably don't need much
[14:08:48] <MikeD_> though i guess scribbles are pretty unique even when looking nothing like the pen&paper version
[14:08:54] <robertmaxrees> it's also much less about practicality and much more about making people feel comfortable.
[14:09:10] <robertmaxrees> they think the signature protects them.
[14:09:16] <MikeD_> haha
[14:09:57] <MikeD_> "sign this tablet" and people shrug and do it, they have no idea about how to protect themselves anyway, eh?
[14:12:18] <Sayona> Hi i have this code http://pastebin.ca/3741378 , if i click on the div the radio is changed but the  function valueChanged() not work anymore...
[14:12:53] <Sayona> if i delete $('#modulsiglaregio').click(function () and  $('#modulsiglaue').click(function () the  valueChanged() work
[14:12:59] <Sayona> but I want to add classes at click
[14:14:41] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle pls :)
[14:15:30] <Sayona> 2s
[14:25:27] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/9aqzu2p3/
[14:25:35] <Sayona> but is not displayed ok :(
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[14:26:05] <robertmaxrees> why are you using onchange ?
[14:26:10] <robertmaxrees> why not use jquery event bindings?>
[14:26:18] <Sayona> tell me how
[14:26:19] <Sayona> please
[14:26:25] <robertmaxrees> you're already using them for click.
[14:26:29] <robertmaxrees> and the learning center shows you how.
[14:27:52] <Sayona> $('#modulsiglaue').click(function () { ?
[14:29:42] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[14:29:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/9aqzu2p3/1/
[14:29:52] <robertmaxrees> also: you were missing juqery.
[14:30:14] <robertmaxrees> only you want .change()
[14:30:45] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, but the date from checked not change..
[14:30:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:31:16] <Sayona> the radio bottons
[14:31:20] <Sayona> using show hide
[14:31:27] <robertmaxrees> show me :)
[14:31:33] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[14:31:50] <Sayona> i put my code but not display the images
[14:31:52] <Sayona> no know why
[14:32:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm confusd.
[14:32:06] <Sayona> https://jsfiddle.net/9aqzu2p3/
[14:32:19] <Sayona> ah
[14:32:21] <Sayona> wait
[14:32:38] <robertmaxrees> btw you're missing jquery in there.
[14:32:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/9aqzu2p3/2/
[14:32:41] <robertmaxrees> this has it.
[14:32:44] <robertmaxrees> so start there.
[14:33:58] <Sayona> thanks
[14:38:24] <qakhan> any thought on my question
[14:38:59] <robertmaxrees> qakhan what was your question?
[14:39:53] <qakhan> toggle between tables first row. https://jsfiddle.net/vvmzq9c0/1/
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:42:26] <qakhan> i want to toggle between different tables first rows
[14:42:40] <robertmaxrees> "different tables first rows" seems odd.
[14:43:04] <ExtraSteve> Add $('table tr:first-child').removeClass('clicked'); before you toggle the class
[14:43:29] <ExtraSteve> I assume that's what you're trying to do, at least
[14:44:46] <ExtraSteve> That'll force-remove the clicked class from all the other tables first rows
[14:45:07] <ExtraSteve> And then your call to $(this).toggleClass will apply the 'clicked' class again
[14:46:24] <ExtraSteve> Though that doesn't help if you click the same one twice. Maybe just do a test for it then like: if($(this).hasClass()) { //remove class } else { //add class }
[14:46:30] <ExtraSteve> Should work
[14:49:06] <qakhan> ExtraSteve you are right
[14:49:34] <qakhan> $('table tr:first-child').removeClass('clicked');    toggle the class but not remove the from selected row
[14:49:49] <qakhan> let me try if($(this).hasClass()) { //remove class } else { //add class }
[14:53:37] <ExtraSteve> qakhan: this: https://jsfiddle.net/vvmzq9c0/3/
[14:53:49] <ExtraSteve> I'm sure there's a better way of doing it, but I'm lazy and this works :p
[14:55:00] <qakhan> i have done the same thing. but its not removing the class
[14:55:14] <qakhan> when we click on same group
[14:55:27] <ExtraSteve> oh hmm
[14:55:40] <ExtraSteve> Oh, thatm akes sense
[14:56:40] <ExtraSteve> This: https://jsfiddle.net/vvmzq9c0/4/
[14:57:09] <ExtraSteve> The problem was that we were removing the class on ALL of the nodes, then asking "does $(this) have the class?" and of course it never did because we just finished removing it
[14:57:12] <ExtraSteve> :p
[14:57:43] <qakhan> got it, Thanks it working
[14:58:52] <ExtraSteve> With comments: https://jsfiddle.net/vvmzq9c0/5/
[14:58:55] <ExtraSteve> And neatened up a bit
[15:06:31] <qakhan> ExtraSteve Thanks
[15:10:10] <jak2013> hi all
[15:10:13] <jak2013> wRenglon = [tr#row12822.myRowId, prevObject: m.fn.init[1], context: button.editarRenglon.btn.btn-sucess]
[15:10:56] <jak2013> var myId = wRenglon.find(".myRowId").text();
[15:11:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:11:06] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle duder
[15:11:10] <jak2013> myId=""  why?
[15:11:12] <jak2013> ok :(
[15:20:47] <MassDebates> I'm back.
[15:21:44] <MassDebates> The signature isn't difficult; I just used a plugin for it a while ago. what I was really concerned about was the logistics of the data table, inputting in it, and getting some feedback of making it easy for... *gasp* -OLD PEOPLE- *endgasp*
[15:23:12] <MassDebates> The signature is required per legal dept. Deals can be in exceess of $500k (typical 5 axis machine sells for more if it's packed with a palleting system)
[15:24:24] <Sayona> Is a way to use jquery if i click on the text in input button to check the radio?
[15:24:44] <MassDebates> You can wrap the input in a label for the radio.
[15:25:30] <MassDebates> Any click interactions with the label, so long as its 'for' attribute is correctly set, will activate the first (i think first, you should only be doing 1 matcher anyways) radio button that it's matching.
[15:25:42] <Sayona> found a solution
[15:25:46] <jak2013> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jk87o23x/9/
[15:26:03] <jak2013> when i click on button Editar not retreive the first column why?
[15:31:15] <jak2013> the value of first column in this case: 12822
[16:02:39] <Sayona> Hi, can anyone give me a example/tutorial how to add a class to a div when i check the radio?
[16:04:17] <ExtraSteve> $('#element').click(function() { $('#some-div').addClass('myclass'); });
[16:04:23] <ExtraSteve> And on that note, I'm gonna go drive home
[16:04:24] * ExtraSteve afk
[16:04:55] <Sayona> drive safe!
[16:04:56] <Sayona> thanks
[17:17:45] <JonelethIrenicus> how can i get the closest div by id that was inserted via ajax
[17:18:00] <robertmaxrees> define "closest"
[17:30:58] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[17:48:06] <adamsilver> Is it really beneficial to store jQ at the end of the page? It's a bit of a hassle if I do
[17:54:34] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver depends on what you're looking at.
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> adamsilver some browsers will see performance improvements because it holds off execution until after the page basically existsd.
[18:05:05] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: the closest div with a specific id that is lower down the source tree
[18:05:09] <JonelethIrenicus> not higher
[18:05:21] <robertmaxrees> so you mean a child.
[18:05:30] <robertmaxrees> a descenden.
[18:08:16] <robertmaxrees> JonelethIrenicus
[18:09:01] <JonelethIrenicus> well i am not sure of the exact wording as the element is not within a parent <div> tag that I am referencing
[18:09:01] <madprops> how come i can't access an object with it's index number?
[18:09:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:09:13] <robertmaxrees> show me the markup then.
[18:09:44] <madprops> how can i access 7089 if i don't know that number? http://i.imgur.com/uF98WIB.jpg
[18:10:00] <madprops> but i have the root object
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> madprops make a fiddle - show us the actual data instead of a screenshot of the console's pretty print :)
[18:10:19] <madprops> too complicated
[18:10:24] <madprops> i think it's clear enough :/
[18:10:26] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[18:10:28] <robertmaxrees> good luck then.
[18:10:32] <madprops> wow
[18:10:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:12:15] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/og6gwen1/3/
[18:13:19] <robertmaxrees> JonelethIrenicus first of all fix your html.
[18:15:39] <robertmaxrees> can't repeat IDs on the same page.
[18:17:51] <JonelethIrenicus> ahh yeah
[18:26:11] <robertmaxrees> still got invalid markup yo.
[18:26:18] <robertmaxrees> woops acccidentlaly scrolled up.
[19:25:24] <JonelethIrenicus> after changing an id for a tab div the tab links no longer work
[19:38:21] <lewix> hi folks
[19:38:27] <lewix> $("div[data-row='${row}']['data-col='${col}']") - what's wrong with this line of code
[19:48:59] <shoky> lewix: ${...} only works inside template literals `...`
[20:02:42] <JonelethIrenicus> can you not change the id for jquery ui tab div containers?
[20:07:19] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: from the API docs:  Each tab panel may be any valid element but it must have an id which corresponds to the hash in the anchor of the associated tab.
[20:09:49] <b1tchcakes> can someone tell me why this isn't working. http://hastebin.com/efoduhuwom.xml
[20:10:07] <b1tchcakes> the issue is that I have to click the link, which changes the href, and then click again for it to actually open in the new tab.
[20:11:21] <shoky> then don't change the href in a click handler?
[20:11:46] <shoky> change it on page load or whenever you want to
[20:12:19] <shoky> or uh.. just put the url in the href to begin with ?
[20:12:45] <shoky> oh it has that form.serialize, eh
[20:13:58] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: what if you change the associations after the fact?
[20:14:22] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: is there a way to re-connect those automatically?
[20:15:02] <b1tchcakes> i can't put it in there to begin with.  we have a form that preexists and we are trying to create a batch of links that grabs the form data, generates a URL, and fires it off to a different URL, without changing the form.
[20:15:17] <b1tchcakes> what I have there works, it is just requiring pressing the link twice instead of once.
[20:15:28] <shoky> b1tchcakes: actually that should work the way you have it.. works for me
[20:17:06] <shoky> JonelethIrenicus: refresh method maybe, depending on how much you actually change..
[20:17:18] <JonelethIrenicus> shoky: i tried it, but no dice
[20:17:26] <b1tchcakes> it doesn't work in any browser (crhome, FF, Safari) that I've tried.  I have to click the link, which sets the href and then click again for it to actually open the new tab with the revised url.
[20:18:59] <shoky> b1tchcakes: this works fine for me in chrome  https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/13/
[20:27:33] <b1tchcakes> shoky - thanks.  i just modified your script and it does in fact work as expected.  now i'm lost, but at least I know its a conflict somewhere in my page's other contents I guess.
[20:58:06] <lewix> shoky: true my mistake, however $("div[data-row='`${row}`'][data-col='`${col}`']") is not working either
[20:59:29] <shoky> lewix: you can't have string literal inside a string literal.  you can do:  $(`div[data-row='${row}'][data-col='${col}']`)
[21:01:12] <lewix> shoky: I was pretty sure that string interpolation expected `
[21:01:18] <lewix> `` as opposed to ''
[21:01:55] <shoky> lewix: if you have a string with "" quotes around it already, then putting ' or ` inside it will just output those characters
[21:02:10] <shoky> same if you have a string with '' quotes, and theres ` or " inside
[21:02:21] <shoky> same if you have a string with `` quotes, and there's ' or " inside
[21:02:21] <shoky> :P
[21:03:00] <shoky> and yes, you can only do string interpolation inside a string wrapped with ``
[21:03:10] <shoky> but in your example your string was wrapped with ""
[21:03:23] <shoky> and it happened to have ` inside the string
[21:03:35] <lewix> shoky: ah i see thanks buddy
[21:03:40] <shoky> shure
[21:04:58] <robertmaxrees> dat shoky
[21:05:20] <shoky> eyo, thought you were goners for the day
[21:06:39] <robertmaxrees> usually am.  I've been taking my wife to physical therapy on mondays and heading to a bar to catch up on work stuff.
[21:07:07] <shoky> you go to a bar for that? :P
[21:11:25] <lewix> interesting lifestyle..
[21:12:33] <robertmaxrees> ha.  it's a break if nothing else.
[21:20:15] <gambl0re> hi robert
[21:20:26] <gambl0re> hows going?
[21:40:16] <robertmaxrees> alright folks.  i'm off.  enjoy.
