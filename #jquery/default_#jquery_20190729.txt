[06:11:30] <tneva82> hello. We have basically div that is fixed position at top 0px that's supposed to cover whole screen when called for(sort of like full screen dialog). This works fine except for some reason datepicker elements inside it don't work. Seems they get pushed waaaay down below the screen and ergo never seen. is there any way to fix it? Alternative is drop the datepicker alltogether
[06:22:10] <Guest94> hi, me again. we are upgradin from jquery 1.4.4 to 3.x with middle step to 1.12.4. a question about data-attributes: in html: data-myvalue="0.0000", in js: consoile.log(.data("myvalue")) result in "0.0000" but it used to result in 0
[06:23:02] <Guest94> so, in jquery 1.4.4 we got number and in jquery 1.12.4 we got string
[06:23:33] <Guest94> why is this behaving diferently and why this isn't mentioned in jquery upgrade docs
[07:24:53] <tneva82> okay so it's something to do with the main window being rather long so datepicker seems to pick position based on the scroll position of main page, not the div where date field is
[09:48:44] <Guest47> Hi everyone
[09:49:32] <Guest47> I'm running into an issue trying to defer something.
[09:51:06] <Guest47> I want to call a function on "#lightSlider" which doesn't exist on page load. To mitigate this, the function doesn't fire until after the modal surrounding it opens
[09:51:21] <Guest47> However, this still doesnt work and I get a deferred exception error
[10:01:52] <pavonia> Okay, noticed.
[10:03:09] <Guest47> To replicate this, go to (https://mejai.netlify.com/) and click on the first link (White Noise)
[10:03:29] <Guest47> However, once you close that modal, and re-open it, it is fine

[11:02:25] <MikeD_> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/896777/how-to-remove-close-button-on-the-jquery-ui-dialog  why is there a single pipe between ui.dialog and ui  in the selector for .hide()?
[11:05:23] <robertmaxrees> you mean in https://stackoverflow.com/a/50836102/923919 ?
[11:05:41] <MikeD_> yes
[11:05:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that's a typo.
[11:07:00] <MikeD_> that's what i thought too, thanks for confirming ... but after 702 upvotes on SO, i'd have expected the swarm to have called it out already
[11:07:05] <robertmaxrees> since a single pipe is a bitwise OR - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#(Bitwise_OR)
[11:07:34] <robertmaxrees> and my guess is that it's supposed to be "pseudocode" - neither of the objects it's referencing exist, either.
[11:07:50] <shoky> definitely a typo. and that argument doesn't really do anything, at least in latest jqui
[11:10:16] <shoky> fixed the typo
[11:11:02] <MikeD_> that's cool
[11:11:07] <shoky> er someone changed it from || to | in a previous edit
[11:11:10] <shoky> " 	Should be a single pipe otherwise is a condition"
[11:11:11] <shoky> what
[11:11:17] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[11:11:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like somebody has no idea wtf
[11:11:26] <shoky> heh
[11:11:31] <MikeD_> it's not regex
[11:12:30] <shoky> heh the original answer was just:  open: function(event, ui) { $(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").hide(); }
[11:12:40] <MikeD_> so what is the second parameter doing?
[11:12:54] <shoky> nothing, because ui is an empty object
[11:13:13] <shoky> (according to docs)
[11:13:27] <robertmaxrees> usually it's like using .find() - $('.foo').find('.bar') becomes $('.bar', '.foo')
[11:13:31] <MikeD_> *sigh* so $(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").hide() is correct?
[11:13:33] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, there it's not going anything.
[11:13:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:13:50] <MikeD_> thank you (both)
[11:13:57] <robertmaxrees> or use .addClass() and .removeClass() with a utility css class that hides/shows
[11:14:30] <shoky> MikeD_: i wouldn't say that's correct either, for cases where there are multiple dialogs
[11:14:53] <MikeD_> oh, so too big hammer
[11:15:10] <robertmaxrees> good point shoky
[11:15:33] <shoky> a comment says this, looks like it could be right:  $(this).parent().find(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").hide()
[11:16:48] <shoky> i think when i needed to do it i just used css
[11:17:23] <MikeD_> yeah, i prefer presentation be in css (i'm a heretic)
[11:17:27] <shoky> .my-dialog .ui-dialog-titlebar-close { display: none !important; }   or somesuch
[11:21:37] <MikeD_> do you use the close on escape feature?
[11:21:55] <robertmaxrees> you should imo
[11:24:16] <MikeD_> if you resolve a deferred (with false) in the close function, how do you make the dialog close in the deferred (with true) case of proceed?  (aside from the face that i've already resolved before calling .close() but it seems wrong to have that called again
[11:25:05] <shoky> fiddle me this
[11:25:13] <MikeD_> kk
[11:33:43] <MikeD_> .dialog is not a function, what am i doing wrong?
[11:34:34] <robertmaxrees> have you loaded jquery ui?
[11:36:14] <MikeD_> got it now
[11:39:23] <MikeD_> https://jsfiddle.net/vLkwoau9/
[11:47:00] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to accomplish here?
[11:47:33] <shoky> MikeD_: a deferred can only be resolved once, hence it's fine to call .resolve(false) again after it's already resolved to true
[11:49:08] <shoky> (calling .resolve again does nothing)
[11:50:09] <MikeD_> "fine" and "good" might be worth a moment of thought :)
[11:50:33] <shoky> MikeD_: your code is good, it's the right way of handling it, imo
[11:50:41] <MikeD_> ok, thanks
[11:50:50] <shoky> sure ;]
[11:51:48] <MikeD_> i was trying to imagine setting the resolve only in the close, then having to park the true/false somewhere ... but if good enough is good enough, i'll move on.
[11:52:20] <shoky> that would be doing lots of work for no reason. deferreds/promises are meant to be used this way
[11:53:37] <MikeD_> so far it's been a good day on irc, i should probably go home now  :)
[11:54:11] <shoky> i would. i hear it's sweet, home. sweet
[12:28:41] <grapheti> HOME IS WHERE YOU MAKE IT
[12:29:58] <shoky> oh no it's this guy
[12:30:43] <grapheti> I HAVE MY RIGHTS!
[12:31:36] <shoky> lefts mostly
[12:37:38] <grapheti> Hear about that guy who lost all his left side?
[12:37:42] <grapheti> He's alright.
[12:52:12] <shoky> lul
[20:18:44] <jsin> I want to select (so I can copy to clipboard) a form text input field. How can I do document.getElementByID() with a jquery form element?
