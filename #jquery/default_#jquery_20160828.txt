[00:58:59] <DexDeadly> So I'm building a dashboard for my home automation and I'm looking to read from an API to set some values.  Whats the best way to go about it.
[02:04:06] <Darmani> Hey guys, I wanted to get a navbar kinda like this one where it becomes fixed as the user scrolls down.
[02:04:07] <Darmani> http://vastpic.com/
[02:04:11] <Darmani> How would I do that?
[02:43:12] <jak2000> how to paste a text that exist in the clipboard on #textArea
[02:48:05] <troll_king> hi
[02:48:24] <troll_king> i need to set position left which one should i use?
[02:48:57] <troll_king> css or position?
[02:50:14] <antipsychiatry> Hi
[08:12:16] <codecutter> How do i remove the section '.foo' from this $(htmlString)?
[08:15:06] <codecutter> anyone?
[10:09:23] <_rubik> Hey guys. Im currently chaging the content of certain paragraphs with .text, but can anyone think of some effects or timing to make this less jarring?
[14:13:28] <randohinn> o/ Is there a way to get the element, that I faded, in the callback of a fadeIn? $(this) does not work...
[15:24:54] <TWG_> I'm still trying to learn as much as I can about jquery but I'm a little lost on how to take the data being returned by an API I'm calling and put it in a similar format thats shown here.  http://kopy.io/CTyaB
[15:47:51] <TWG_> No one is online today?
[16:35:28] <paul_irish> what's poppin #jquery
[16:43:03] <paul_irish> word.
[16:55:35] <ThatWebGuy> Anyone on yet?
[16:57:12] <paul_irish> ThatWebGuy: sup
[16:57:37] <ThatWebGuy> I'm still trying to learn as much as I can about jquery but I'm a little lost on how to take the data being returned by an API I'm calling and put it in a similar format thats shown here.  http://kopy.io/CTyaB
[16:58:38] <paul_irish> well.. can you paste the JSON.stringify(data) that you get back from your api ?
[17:02:02] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish actually the JSON.stringify(data) solved my issue.  It works now.
[17:02:38] <paul_irish> oooooooooooooooooookey doke. not exactly sure it should.. as you're ending up with a big string rather than an object
[17:02:41] <paul_irish> but okay! :)
[17:03:30] <ThatWebGuy> So that's not in an array format?
[17:04:00] <paul_irish> stringify takes an object/array and turns it into a string
[17:04:26] <ThatWebGuy> Oh.  Well maybe that didn't fix it.  LOL
[17:04:27] <ThatWebGuy> My bad
[17:04:39] <paul_irish> so data could already be an array. i have no idea. which is why you'd need to paste part of that for me to see what you need to do to it
[17:04:50] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.
[17:10:48] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish do you want me to paste it here?
[17:11:21] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish http://kopy.io/jn7Xq
[17:11:52] <paul_irish> thanks looking.
[17:14:00] <ThatWebGuy> thanks
[17:16:46] <paul_irish> interesting. it ends with "/v2/location"}]" ?
[17:17:17] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish it's through the WP API
[17:17:24] <ThatWebGuy> and location is a CPT of mine
[17:19:18] <paul_irish> alright so this is what i'm seeing for your `data`. Look right so far? https://gyazo.com/b115576e43643cf542b20610c2dc7c5b
[17:20:26] <ThatWebGuy> Yes
[17:21:22] <paul_irish> good. so basically the job now is to translate this API data object format into your offices objects
[17:21:33] <ThatWebGuy> Okay
[17:22:53] <paul_irish> There's a few ways to do it, but we want to loop over `data`, and for each item we're going to construct a new object. And we can set up a little mapping between the key names.
[17:22:57] <Uhkis> paul_irish: are you THE paul irish or some dirty imposter?
[17:23:15] <paul_irish> Uhkis: real one. just hangin out ;)
[17:23:18] <ThatWebGuy> okay paul_irish
[17:23:45] * Uhkis bows
[17:23:56] * paul_irish trying to think of a spot where we can look at a JS console at the same time..
[17:24:00] <ThatWebGuy> Uhkis I didn't even think to ask that.
[17:24:47] <paul_irish> i think codepen has something for this... one second
[17:24:57] <paul_irish> Uhkis: know of antyhing?
[17:25:36] <Uhkis> iirc jsbin has a log panel
[17:25:58] <Uhkis> console panel
[17:26:10] <paul_irish> hmm and if i give ThatWebGuy the url will it update as i edit the jsbin?
[17:26:14] <paul_irish> i forget.

[17:28:36] <paul_irish> ThatWebGuy: ^
[17:37:12] <paul_irish> ThatWebGuy: you see all this?
[17:37:22] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish yes i can
[17:37:26] <paul_irish> cool
[17:37:30] <paul_irish> makes sense so far, yah?
[17:42:07] <morlenxus> Hey, i can't apply "ui-state-error-text" with jqueryui 1.12 anymore, has the css style for this been changed?
[17:42:23] <paul_irish> ThatWebGuy: seems like its working
[17:42:25] <paul_irish> https://gyazo.com/f9eb918a3b35bb15db7c7c12289a7085
[17:43:16] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish yes it does.  That's awesome.  I would haven't been working on that for a lot longer than it took you to write it up.
[17:43:38] <paul_irish> cool. :) glad to help
[17:44:01] <paul_irish> I will point out that `name` isn't in there.
[17:44:13] <ThatWebGuy> okay.
[17:44:21] <paul_irish> ThatWebGuy: is that coming from data[0].title.rendered ?
[17:44:23] <paul_irish> probably.
[17:44:41] <ThatWebGuy> yes it is
[17:44:51] <paul_irish> k.
[17:45:07] <paul_irish> for that one, then we'd probably just set that directly because we can't use the same mapping
[17:45:24] <ThatWebGuy> okay
[17:45:38] <paul_irish> just added that. line 61.
[17:46:34] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.
[17:46:36] <paul_irish> i suppose you can fork that pen if you want to play around with it more. or w/e
[17:46:41] <paul_irish> good luck!
[17:46:44] <ThatWebGuy> So are you the actual Paul Irish that works for Google?
[17:46:48] <paul_irish> ya
[17:46:59] <ThatWebGuy> That's awesome.
[17:47:06] <ThatWebGuy> I really appreciate you taking the time to help me
[17:47:19] <paul_irish> psh as if working for Google is all that i'm good for! I used to be on the jQuery team!
[17:47:32] <paul_irish> how i've fallen so far from grace.
[17:47:34] <paul_irish> :p
[17:47:57] <ThatWebGuy> Oh really.  That's cool.  I just work for a University maintaining their websites.
[17:48:25] <ThatWebGuy> I would love to work for someone like Google or WordPress.
[17:49:23] <paul_irish> it's good. i recommend it. :)
[17:50:17] <ThatWebGuy> Thanks again.
[17:50:37] <paul_irish> <3z
[17:58:11] <ThatWebGuy> paul_irish just plugged that in and it worked like a charm.
[20:44:32] <Darmani> Guys, how do I get my navbar to do this?
[20:44:32] <Darmani> http://vastpic.com/
[20:47:52] <ThatWebGuy> Darmani when do a scroll down based on the view height you would add a sticky class to the navigation.
[20:49:01] <Darmani> ThatWebGuy: got it!
[20:49:18] <ThatWebGuy> Does that make sense?
[20:49:45] <ThatWebGuy> Some frameworks have that built into them like UIkit.
[20:50:01] <Darmani> ThatWebGuy: I think so.
[20:50:16] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  I'll be on for a bit if you need some help.
[20:50:27] <Darmani> ThatWebGuy: thanks man!
[20:50:36] <ThatWebGuy> Not a problem Darmani
[21:24:45] <wofool> hey guys, kind of a conceptual problem, I'm trying to learn https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/guides/core-concepts/ my problem is with parameters, my understanding is when you define a function, the parameter names don't matter in terms of what is passed, but looking at these examples, things like args, session, and next seem to carry the value, can someone help clear this up for me?   -> sorry this is javascript question but that room is
[21:24:45] <wofool> closed :(
