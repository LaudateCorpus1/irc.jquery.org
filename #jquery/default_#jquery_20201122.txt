[10:34:54] <quackgyver> Based on this snippet, is there a reason why #menu and #header aren't having their classes toggled?
[10:35:02] <quackgyver> Because only the middle line triggers.
[10:35:49] <quackgyver> I'm trying to figure out if there's some kind of syntax error or something going on.
[10:39:52] <quackgyver> Nvm, seems to be something going on with the browser. The triggers are super buggy. Works fine in other browsers.
