[00:09:08] <pavonia> RandomSerb: Don't serve the whole page but only a JS snippet that then loads the contents
[06:08:42] <weijunli> hey, im trying to send a screenshot with (html2canvas.hertzen.com), the send() should be invoked automatically and POST to a server, heres what I got https://jsfiddle.net/2hkuvyxt/3/ - what am i missing?
[06:31:56] <cbilt> hello
[07:49:11] <RandomSerb> given I want pagination on ajax, is it better to always recreate <table> by creating a html for it in an variable then appending where I need it, or simply change values in the html table?
[11:40:27] <aruns> Hey guys, is it possible in jQuery to respond to any event fired for a listener?
[11:40:38] <aruns> So for instance, if I take the body element
[11:40:56] <aruns> Is it possible to do something like jQuery(body).on('any-event', function (e) { // code goes here } etc.?
[11:41:21] <aruns> As I want to identify custom events as opposed to native DOM events.
[11:42:33] <aruns> But it looks type has to be an object.
[11:42:37] <aruns> For the on function
[11:43:05] <aruns> Ah, found it.
[11:44:46] <aruns> Actually still doesn't answer question.
