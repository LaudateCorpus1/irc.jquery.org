[00:00:41] <shesek_> bjhaid, what's `delay()`?
[00:02:54] <bjhaid> shesek_: I am trying to hide images and display them randomly
[00:03:44] <shesek_> bjhaid, specifically, what should `imgas.splice(0|Math.random() * imgas.length, 1)[0]` do?
[00:04:59] <shesek_> It takes a random element and removes it from the array. That's your intent?
[00:05:17] <bjhaid> shesek_: yes, then append to the id
[00:05:51] <bjhaid> it works on ie though it does not fade but on chrome and firefox, it breaks
[00:06:30] <shesek_> bjhaid, perhaps `i` always evaluates to false?
[00:06:48] <shesek_> I'd add a break point and check it really contains the value you're expecting it to contain
[00:07:48] <bjhaid> it s a lop
[00:07:50] <bjhaid> for(var i=0; i<3; i++
[00:07:53] <bjhaid> loop
[00:08:40] <shesek_> so the first iteration always passes nextImage as the callback for nextImage, which does that again
[00:08:46] <shesek_> what's ever causing it to stop?
[00:09:01] <bjhaid> yes
[00:09:13] <bjhaid> its an infinite loop
[00:09:29] <shesek_> blah, * as the callback for fadeOut, I mean
[00:10:16] <bjhaid> okay
[00:10:36] <shesek_> so... fix it?
[00:10:49] <shesek_> it would be much easier and much less of a guesswork if you'll just paste the whole thing
[00:12:02] <bjhaid> okay let me do that
[00:12:15] <bjhaid> though expanding the error shows window.setTimeout
[00:12:24] <bjhaid> so I guess its the delay thing
[00:12:29] <bjhaid> but let me paste it out
[00:13:47] <bjhaid> shesek_: http://pastebin.com/sfcTRRji
[00:26:20] <bjhaid> shesek_: any ideas?
[00:27:17] <level09> why is jquery.submit() not passing any get parameters when called on a form ?
[00:27:17] <shesek_> not really. add some debugging?
[00:27:58] <shesek_> add some console.log() to your nextImage, see how often / how many times it gets called
[00:29:19] <level09> should I serialize my data and pass it to the submit() functioni ?
[00:31:19] <bjhaid> thanks
[00:32:44] <shesek_> level09, http://jsfiddle.net/J3nzV/1/
[00:32:56] <shesek_> you're most likely doing something else wrong.
[00:33:51] <level09> coffee script ?
[00:34:16] <shesek_> yes, sorry. I'm too lazy to write JS after 30+ hours of straight work :)
[00:34:40] <level09> :)
[00:34:58] <level09> no worries, just wanted to know i missed something
[00:36:14] <level09> yeah that works, just needed to reorder my script
[00:36:28] <level09> should jquery code go to the head or bottom of my page ?
[00:36:57] <shesek_> there's no place where it "should" go
[00:37:12] <shesek_> you need to make sure that code who uses the DOM is executed after the DOM is ready
[00:37:29] <shesek_> which can be done using $(document).ready(function() { /*  code here */ })
[00:37:43] <shesek_> or using the $(function() { /* code here */ }) shortcut
[00:38:45] <shesek_> However, placing your code at the end of the document does have some benefits - loading your JavaScript code / files doesn't delay loading the HTML of the page, making the page render quicker (tho not with all the functionality, of course)
[00:39:21] <shesek_> and placing the code there also guarantees the DOM is already ready... but you probably shouldn't rely on that and still use the `ready` event
[00:40:26] <level09> shesek_: we have some really big sites with ads form many networks, relying on document.ready is not that practical
[00:40:46] <level09> I'm trying to move away from that by placing scripts right after the dom (inline)
[00:40:57] <shesek_> level09, external files don't delay the ready event
[00:41:13] <level09> ah
[00:41:20] <shesek_> its triggered when all the DOM is parsed, but before any images/CSS files/iframes/etc are loaded
[00:41:27] <shesek_> for that, you have to `load` event
[00:41:39] <level09> then I must have a big html page
[00:41:52] <level09> because it was really taking time to invoke
[00:42:10] <level09> plus many ads are just inline scripts
[00:42:14] <level09> like double click ads
[00:43:13] <shesek_> synchronous <script> tags do delay the DOM ready event
[00:43:26] <shesek_> I mean, they delay everything, the stop HTML rendering
[00:43:33] <shesek_> it'll also delay scripts located at the end of the document
[00:43:51] <janthony> How would I iterate through Object { Invalid Input="Money fields may only a...d inputs. $5.00 is not."} ? I tried data.each(function(){ console.log(this) }); but it's just logging the object again instead the key value pair as a string.
[00:44:49] <shesek_> `data.each()`, data being a plain object?
[00:45:09] <shesek_> unless you added stuff to Object.prototype (which you shouldn't), it shouldn't work
[00:45:27] <level09> have any 1 started using these new html5 attributes ? like defer and async ?
[00:45:29] <shesek_> that being said... if for some reason it does do anything, check what arguments are provided to the function you're passing
[00:45:52] <shesek_> level09, it won't help with those ads providers
[00:46:09] <shesek_> I mean, their code has to be explicitly written to allow that
[00:46:37] <shesek_> they're usually using `document.write()` to output their code - which *has* to delay the execution
[00:46:54] <level09> shesek_: is there a way to write these ads (scripts) into the DOM after everything is loaded ?
[00:47:01] <shesek_> I do believe double click has an asynchronous version, tho
[00:47:14] <level09> perhaps I should use iframes ?
[00:47:15] <shesek_> level09, again, its something the ad provider has to support
[00:47:21] <shesek_> you can put it in an iframe, tho
[00:47:27] <shesek_> but it'll be problematic for contextual ads
[00:47:29] <janthony> shesek_: It's an object returned via success: function(data) on a json ajax request.
[00:47:37] <level09> yeah, that is the problem
[00:47:47] <level09> anyway, thanks for the help, much appreciated
[00:47:59] <shesek_> again, <shesek_> I do believe double click has an asynchronous version, tho
[00:48:03] <shesek_> look it up
[00:48:25] <shesek_> other ad providers are probably not contextual (?), making it possible to use an iframe
[00:48:38] <shesek_> and you welcome
[00:51:47] <janthony> Objects in JS confuse me. Everything in console is an object, even if it's an array.
[00:52:03] <janthony> So an object can be object or an array basically.
[00:53:00] <shesek_> janthony, or a string or a Date or a regex or a function....
[00:53:01] <janthony> So everything is object and you have to loop through objects and arrays differently in JS, how are you suppose to know if it's an array or an object?
[00:53:03] <shesek_> everything is an object, really
[00:53:42] <shesek_> janthony, for debugging purposes, console.log() usually shows an helpful label
[00:54:25] <shesek_> in some cases it doesn't - you can use obj.toString() or obj.constructor.name
[00:55:18] <shesek_> But because toString() can be overridden, you should probably use Object.prototype.toString.call(obj), which is basically the same but uses the native toString() from the Object prototype
[00:55:30] <janthony> shesek_:  Yea, I don't get it because $.each(data, function(name, value) { console.log(name + ": " + value); }); still console.loged an object instead of a string...
[00:55:56] <shesek_> `name + ": " + value` can't return an object, it has to be a string
[00:56:13] <shesek_> even if both name and value are objects, concating it with a string casts the whole thing to a string
[00:56:35] <shesek_> so you must be looking at some other console.log
[00:56:37] <janthony> nope, the above code returns the following in console: Object { Invalid Input="Money fields may only a...d inputs. $5.00 is not."}
[00:56:37] <janthony> .
[00:57:06] <janthony> and for the response tab: {"Invalid Input":"Money fields may only accept numbers and a single decimal as input. For example, 5, 5.00, and 5.23 are all valid inputs. $5.00 is not."}
[00:57:12] <shesek_> and $.each(obj, ...) is very different from `obj.each(...)`
[00:57:27] <shesek_> janthony, you're looking at something else. Add a break point in there and inspect the values
[00:57:29] <janthony> shesek_:  Tried both. They both console.log an object
[00:58:52] <janthony> shesek_: Ahh, good call. whoops
[01:00:53] <janthony> hrm, now that is gone, it's not logging anything when iterating with .each
[01:01:20] <janthony> the other console.log that I removed was before the .each, but the actual one inside the each isn't logging anything
[01:01:22] <shesek_> janthony, <shesek_> unless you added stuff to Object.prototype (which you shouldn't), it shouldn't work
[01:01:46] <janthony> shesek_:  The manual says .each works on objects an arrays though
[01:01:51] <shesek_> There's no obj.each natively (can be added, but its not added by jQuery)
[01:02:04] <shesek_> janthony, $.each(objOrArray, func)
[01:02:10] <shesek_> not objOrArray.each(func)
[01:03:02] <shesek_> (don't take "can be added" as should be added - modifying the object's prototype is a bad idea)
[01:03:26] <shesek_> either use $.each(), or come over to the dark side and use CoffeeScript
[01:03:47] <shesek_> (which gives a much nicer syntax to iterate over arrays/objects than what JavaScript provides. And we have cookies!)
[01:04:01] <shesek_> (as in, eatable chocolate chips ones)
[01:04:08] <janthony> $.each(data, function(name, value) { console.log(name + ": " + value); }); and $.each(data, function() { console.log(this); }); - don't log anything
[01:05:00] <janthony> that's what I was saying earlier, I have tried each both ways, this way and the other way
[01:05:58] <janthony> thse response for data is {"Invalid Input":"Money fields may only accept numbers and a single decimal as input. For example, 5, 5.00, and 5.23 are all valid inputs. $5.00 is not."}, which is pulled via a dataType: json, ajax request, and doing echo json_encode($my_php_array); on my php script
[01:06:20] <janthony> on my php script to generate the response*
[01:06:49] <shesek_> janthony, it should work. you must have something else wrong
[01:06:50] <shesek_> what does
[01:07:12] <shesek_> console.log('Object:', $.each(data, function(name, value) { console.log('Property: ' + name + ": " + value); }));
[01:07:14] <shesek_> log?
[01:08:23] <janthony> shesek_: That one logged an object and a string (finally)
[01:08:40] <janthony> the string was logged first, then the object
[01:09:50] <shesek_> by "string" you mean "Property: Invalid Input: Money fields may only accept numbers and a single decimal as input. For example, 5, 5.00, and 5.23 are all valid inputs. $5.00 is not." ?
[01:10:08] <shesek_> BTW, Using keys like those is a really bad idea. You'll be much better of using something like {success: false, message: ....}
[01:10:26] <shesek_> or maybe {status: 'invalid_input', message: ...}
[01:11:11] <janthony> shesek_: well, there may be multiple errors, so I'm trying to account for that and loop through them
[01:11:12] <shesek_> In general, using dynamically named properties for that makes it harder to locate and identify them
[01:11:36] <janthony> shesek_: I'll probably end up creating the html and the li's in php and just return that via ajax and append it to my dom
[01:12:20] <janthony> So why did $.each(data, function(name, value) { console.log('Property: ' + name + ": " + value); }); work and not $.each(data, function(name, value) { console.log(name + ": " + value); });?
[01:12:25] <shesek_> janthony, something like { success: false, errors: [ {type: 'invalid_input', message: '...'}, { type: ..., message: ... } ] } is probably better
[01:12:37] <shesek_> janthony, they both works the same. You're testing it wrong, somehow.
[01:12:44] <shesek_> pastebin your code somewhere
[01:13:45] <janthony> wow, looks like my original one works now.. that is really odd.
[01:13:56] <shesek_> See here: http://jsfiddle.net/hdgFe/
[01:14:19] <shesek_> were you testing it from the code itself before and from the console now, or something like that?
[01:17:16] <janthony> no, always tested in console
[01:19:22] <shesek_> dunno than. If it happens again, try checking that `data` really contains what you expect it to (i.e. `console.log` and check its contents)
[01:20:40] <janthony> Ok, thanks for helping out! Can you not do .length on an object? Doing data.length in a conditional, and it's returning false
[01:23:05] <janthony> n/m, looks like I should be using http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/
[01:31:07] <shwaiil> hi
[01:33:54] <shwaiil> Q: Where to find an example, where a object is associated with a given EL #id as an instance. I would like to see some basic examples. This because, usually when creating an object {} that has some properties and its own methods, I dont know how to make an instance of it. Also, it's used globally (I mean shared) with Elements, instead of being specific to a given El. sorry about my english, any tip is appreciated!
[01:48:24] <gyzmodo> guys
[01:48:48] <gyzmodo> jquery-1.7.1.min.js file size is 31KB?
[01:48:58] <gyzmodo> or 91.6KB?
[01:56:33] <shesek_> gyzmodo, ... TIAS
[01:59:20] <gyzmodo> what?
[02:00:48] <gyzmodo> shesek_, i've downloaded jquery-1.7.1.min.js Production (31KB, Minified and Gzipped)
[02:00:56] <gyzmodo> this version
[02:03:13] <gyzmodo> but file's Properties it showing 91.6 KB (93,868 bytes)
[02:05:29] <shesek_> gyzmodo, <gyzmodo> shesek_, i've downloaded jquery-1.7.1.min.js Production (31KB, Minified and Gzipped)
[02:06:27] <gyzmodo> i found answer to my question
[02:06:29] <gyzmodo> thanks
[02:36:28] <RLa> if you use $(selector).css('background-image', 'url(relative url)') then what is base for the relative url, the current document?
[02:48:48] <JKarsrud> I do believe it is relative to the document, yes
[02:59:17] <shwaiil> Q: i'm trying to understand object instanciation. Applying some methods to similar EL structures. But I can't make it work, can someone have a look ? http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/1/
[03:03:59] <shwaiil> http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/3/
[03:04:01] <shwaiil> nah :P
[03:09:52] <JKarsrud> what is it that you're trying to do exactly shwaiil
[03:09:53] <JKarsrud> ?
[03:10:11] <shwaiil> JKarsrud: tks for looking.
[03:10:47] <shwaiil> I'm trying to understand how to do simple "class" instantiation
[03:12:02] <JKarsrud> yes
[03:12:05] <shwaiil> So, for the example above, clicking on #a should return only #a > p
[03:12:18] <shwaiil> and clicking #b should only return #b > p
[03:12:25] <shwaiil> that's something I dont know how to do
[03:13:22] <JKarsrud> oh right, like that
[03:13:55] <shwaiil> I dont know if I explained myself well
[03:14:09] <shwaiil> but anyway, I've gone a lil' bit further, tring to use "self" etc
[03:14:10] <shwaiil> http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/4/
[03:14:24] <shwaiil> withouth success. Now, clicking in #a or #b will return #b
[03:14:35] <shwaiil> it's like .delegate() overwrites previous bind
[03:14:50] <shwaiil> the object is shared and not actual instances
[03:15:15] <JKarsrud> you need to bind the event on the current element, not the whole thing
[03:16:24] <shwaiil> JKarsrud:  but that's what I'm doing
[03:16:46] <shwaiil> $('#foo').delegate(self.el, 'click', function(){ ... }); no ?!
[03:17:02] <shwaiil> self.el = $('#a') || $('#b')
[03:17:43] <JKarsrud> delegating from #foo doesn't really work like that, because you're basically delegating events on every 'div' element inside #foo
[03:17:47] <JKarsrud> look at this instead; http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/5/
[03:18:19] <shwaiil> ok, I tryed with $(self.el).click(function(){...});
[03:18:35] <JKarsrud> there I bind to the click event on the current element
[03:18:48] <shwaiil> give me a sec
[03:20:16] <shwaiil> JKarsrud: hmmm yours working
[03:20:25] <JKarsrud> yes
[03:20:39] <shwaiil> why u have changed the scope of self ?
[03:21:21] <shwaiil> I'm wondering why u say "self.properties" and not "this.properties", while on the x obj
[03:21:36] <JKarsrud> where?
[03:21:54] <JKarsrud> oh right, I was a bit too fast :)
[03:22:16] <JKarsrud> it is supposed to be this, ofc
[03:22:45] <shwaiil> I'll make a few changes on my version, can u have a look ? it doesnt work still
[03:23:06] <JKarsrud> http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/6/ this works
[03:23:07] <shwaiil> http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/7/
[03:23:12] <shwaiil> I'll check it =9
[03:24:00] <JKarsrud> why do you use self all over the place in 7?
[03:24:21] <JKarsrud> and your self variable is global, meaning it will be overwritten by the last instance
[03:25:10] <shwaiil> LOL
[03:25:13] <shwaiil> nice one =)
[03:25:22] <shwaiil> I forgot the var
[03:25:28] <shwaiil> JKarsrud:  thanks :)
[03:25:28] <JKarsrud> you're missing a "var" infront of your self = this, making it a global variable outside of your scope, thus everything inside it is overwritten
[03:25:30] <JKarsrud> exactly :)
[03:25:32] <JKarsrud> http://jsfiddle.net/uUWEW/8/
[03:25:34] <JKarsrud> works ;)
[03:26:21] <shwaiil> JKarsrud: nice one!
[03:26:35] <shwaiil> this will help me a lot, doing better scripts in cleaner code
[03:27:20] <shwaiil> How would this work, if I used "class" name instead of "id". I should use .index() maybe right ?
[03:29:28] <shwaiil> JKarsrud
[03:29:53] <JKarsrud> yeah, or just iterate
[03:30:07] <JKarsrud> using .each()
[03:30:20] <JKarsrud> but what you're doing right now is looking very much like a plugin :)
[03:31:20] <JKarsrud> bbs, gotta make some breakfast before I hit the ym
[03:31:22] <JKarsrud> gym*
[03:31:30] <shwaiil> JKarsrud: really nice :) this will help me a lot. Can you give me some tips, like a good blog to follow or some reading to do ? I had the rhino book from oreally
[03:31:39] <shwaiil> I would like to understand how to use "modules" in js
[03:31:48] <shwaiil> oh ok sorry =) tks for your time
[03:31:48] <shwaiil> that type of concept
[03:31:51] <mathi> hi
[03:32:09] <mathi> how can I disable an option of a <select> element?
[03:33:21] <shwaiil> mathi: let's say, you have 5 selectable options and one of it you want it disabled ?
[03:33:46] <mathi> yes
[03:33:56] <shwaiil> if there's an action associated with the change or selection of each, I dont know you could prevent something to happen, to a specific select by it's index
[03:34:11] <shwaiil> or a diferent flag, like...let's imagine a class name "foo" or #id
[03:34:30] <shwaiil> I mean, on the action for the selection, you'd check if the element is "flagged"
[03:34:44] <shwaiil> if so, you'd stop, otherwise you'd continue with the action
[03:34:53] <shwaiil> Makes sense mathi ?
[03:35:52] <mathi> I just want to disable the option
[03:37:10] <shwaiil> not showing ?
[03:37:20] <shwaiil> why not remove the element from the dom
[03:37:43] <shwaiil> $('select option').eq(index_nr).remove() ?!
[03:37:58] <JKarsrud> shwaiil: well, you could look at RequireJS and AMD
[03:38:17] <shwaiil> $('select option[value="to_disable"]').remove() ?!
[03:38:17] <shwaiil> JKarsrud: thanks :D
[03:39:41] <mathi> disable :)
[03:39:44] <mathi> I want to disable it
[03:40:19] <JKarsrud> mathi: $('select option[value="someValue"]').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[03:40:30] <mathi> thank you
[03:40:31] <JKarsrud> you set the disabled attribute on it
[03:41:11] <redsquare> disabled doesnt work in ie 7/8 iirc
[03:41:21] <redsquare> on a select option
[03:41:27] <shwaiil> mathi, by the way, why do u want to disable it ?
[03:41:28] <JKarsrud> no, I don't think it does either
[03:41:39] <shwaiil> I was more into this mathi http://jsfiddle.net/FDDx3/
[03:42:25] <JKarsrud> redsquare: but it is an option, then you can do a fallback for browsers that don't support disabled on option elements, by preventing its selection etc
[03:42:26] <JKarsrud> :)
[03:42:57] <redsquare> I would rather remove than show something they cant have
[03:43:19] <JKarsrud> ofcourse
[03:43:34] <JKarsrud> I'm just providing solutions here ;)
[03:43:56] <mathi> it's a cut/paste option, if nothing is cut, paste is disabled, I like it that way
[03:44:31] <JKarsrud> yeah, then it sounds like you won't care about IE anyway :)
[03:44:50] <JKarsrud> well, I'm off
[04:02:26] <ph88> how can i use an image instead of a button so i can use $(button).click()  ?

[05:19:58] <danielss89> Hi..
[05:20:04] <danielss89> i use $.get to get some data..
[05:20:27] <danielss89> now in data i have some html with an outer div with id="outerDiv"
[05:20:33] <PhilaisFogg> I'll look into it. Thanks :)
[05:21:09] <danielss89> now i want the html inside the outerDiv, so i would think i'd do $(data).find("#outerDiv").html() <-- but that doesn't work. What is the right way?
[05:24:13] <phil-adept> hi all
[05:31:45] <phil-adept> can anyone give me suggestion on how to do the following? On a project a client has simple hyperlinks that send the user to a page to delete records from a DB. The previous dev didn't impliment any confirmation of sorts. As I'm reskinning the site using some of jQeury's features, one of which being the dialog feature. I know I can bind events to the link to trigger when the link is clicked and
[05:31:45] <phil-adept> show a confirmation dialoge, however I have no idea how to asign the 2x buttons. I know I can return false / $( this ).dialog( "close" ) on the "cancel" button, but how do I allow the user to continue to the destination page if the click "continue"
[05:34:13] <skamikaze> phil-adept: user clicks link, you storage link destination, show dialog, fire button events and on ok you forward to the desired url
[05:35:51] <phil-adept> skamikaze: is that the best method to achieve this? I'm planning on adding a few ui features etc and want to re-use this throughout. How would I apply that logic to form submissions?
[05:35:56] <phil-adept> skamikaze: and thanks btw :)
[05:37:48] <danielss89> $("<div id='someId'>a lot of html</div>") <-- how do i get "a lot of html"?
[05:39:27] <skamikaze> phil-adept: there are kinda 89453345 strategies for app design ;) but if you want sth simple hang on
[05:39:55] <skamikaze> phil-adept: http://softwareas.com/automagic-event-registration
[05:47:13] <phil-adept> skamikaze: that looks great for another project I will be working on further down the line. Thanks for that!
[05:48:50] <phil-adept> skamikaze: regarding my original question I know I can simply capture the intended URL, store then forward, but how do I handle form submissions. Am I right in thinking $( '#theForm' ).submit(); will simply fire the confirmation dialog again and loop?
[05:50:29] <skamikaze> why submit it regulary? use $.serialize and ajax ;)
[05:52:33] <skamikaze> " Am I right in thinking $( '#theForm' ).submit(); will simply fire the confirmation dialog again and loop" no
[05:54:10] <skamikaze> phil-adept: sry - got no coffee yet - of course you can do it that way
[05:54:26] <skamikaze> need to bootstrap my brain dude ;)
[06:05:23] <Liquide> hmmm jquery abandoned the template system they worked on?
[06:07:36] <JKarsrud> Liquide: it will be reworked for jQuery UI, but jquery.tmpl() is not being actively developed I think..
[06:10:23] <andddr> Hi guys. Can anybody suggest how to create a new widget by extending standard UI widget?
[06:13:57] <lxsameer> i have a HTML element in an string that received from server, is it possible to use jquery effects on it before appending it to another element
[06:14:50] <phil-adept> skamikaze: ha ha... bootstrap your brain
[06:15:34] <phil-adept> skamikaze I can't use ajax (yet)... He wants the whole thing redeveloping in a few months time and we're scoping it out now. For his current setup I need to add this little functionality to get his issue sorted
[06:16:36] <andddr> Hi guys. Can anybody suggest how to create a new widget by extending an existing UI widget?
[06:16:51] <sts> hello folks. how can i call a function of my jquery widget from the outside? Eg. trigger a function call of my widget from a <a> element?
[06:17:32] <andddr> sts, $(element).widget().functionUouNeed();
[06:20:56] <sts> andddr: widget().function()? not widget.function()?
[06:23:13] <andddr> sts, widget is a function so use it as widget()
[06:23:42] <andddr> it returns widget instance of element which the widget is assigned to
[06:24:21] <astkfour> i'm trying to use a loop on my code but i'm not sure exactly how to do it. i just want to be able to loop 3 times then stop code-http://jsfiddle.net/Yt5HH/17/
[06:25:59] <lxsameer> can i copy all the events  and handlers bind to an element and its children?
[06:32:20] <sts> andddr: and how can I assign it to a just created element? $('<a>').bind('click', widget().function()); doesn't seem to work.
[06:44:26] <kobane> Can anyone help me make this table row clicking script work across borwsers? http://jsfiddle.net/XtgnS/2/ Works in Chrome, not FF, and I assume not IE!
[06:51:01] <lxsameer> i append an element inside page but its events and handlers does not work
[06:58:00] <sts> I have a ui widget: $.widget("ui.onoBrowser"...  and i would like to create an element from inside my widget, which calls a function of my widget. how can i do it..? $('<a>').bind('click', ....?
[07:01:22] <redsquare> kobane - that doesnt make sense
[07:01:44] <kobane> redsquare: What does not make sense?
[07:01:51] <redsquare> what you are doing
[07:02:13] <redsquare> the element you are finding is the one you have clicked
[07:02:24] <kobane> redsquare: Trying to make a click on a tr trigger a click on a named a.
[07:02:33] <kobane> redsquare: Nope, not necessarily.
[07:02:38] <redsquare> oh - there is a not in the if
[07:03:23] <redsquare> does trigger('click') not work or are you trying to emulate the actual click to follow the href
[07:03:34] <kobane> It basically seems to work. I mean the fiddle works, but in my code the page doesnt follow the link. Itll trigger an onclick alright, but not change the url.
[07:03:51] <kobane> redsquare: want to follow the href.
[07:04:04] <redsquare> why not just window.location = href
[07:04:22] <redsquare> u cant emulate the actual click to follow iirc
[07:04:45] <redsquare> x-browser
[07:04:57] <kobane> redsquare: Suppose I could if I must, but ideally Id like to make the tr click be indentical to the a click (e.g. suppose there was another event bound to a.click)
[07:05:49] <kobane> redsquare: But it works on Chrome, and if you tweak that fiddle youll see that FF will follow the href on row click. Cant see whats stopping it from happening in my app.
[07:06:04] <redsquare> well add another event to the click of the anchor to set windon location, then trigger click, it should run the events then run your new func
[07:19:31] <sts> why do some people do this: var self = this in widgets?
[07:20:59] <redsquare> so they can use that context inside other closures that when fired have a different this context
[07:23:05] <sts> redsquare: so inside a bind() self would reference to the widget?
[07:24:08] <SeanJM> Hi, I created a variable with the contents of a table. var table = $('table').html(); -- I want to select each td and add a class to it. How do I select each td, I tried using $(table).each('td',function(n) { }); -- and that didn't work.
[07:24:10] <sts> redsquare: i am looking for a way to create a $('<a>') and bind('click',..) a call to a widget function.
[07:28:00] <SeanJM> sts: var _a = document.createElement('a'); $(_a).bind("click",function(n) { var $_this = $(this); someWidgetFunction(e,$_this); });
[07:29:04] <SeanJM> sts: something like that. You would need to select the variable which would be the same thing as selecting the DOM, I would create a function where I pass the selected element to it for manipulation
[07:31:31] <lxsameer> how can i check an element visibility
[07:31:33] <sts> SeanJM: i'm creating the element from inside the widget already. Just have a look at the code here: http://pastie.org/private/q6aa4dcfmyv7dseb50iveg
[07:32:18] <sts> SeanJM: I am looking for a way to reference selectTag() from the link object. (marked with: ----HELP----)
[07:34:37] <Guddu> Dear all...I have a simple requirement if someone could help me. I am new to JQuery and i need to have a table with multiple rows with one column containing the checkbox and one column containing a number. What i would like is a hyperlink which changes dynamically (with the number in the table column getting appended to it) when i click a checkbox...Could this be done in JQuery? Please help.
[07:35:12] <sts> redsquare: maybe you could have a look at this too?
[07:35:32] <gyzmodo> Eviltwin, hello
[07:35:59] <gyzmodo> $(".box2").height($(".box1").height());
[07:36:07] <gyzmodo> that's what i need :)
[07:36:18] <SeanJM> sts: link.bind('click',selectTag($(this)); <-- wouldn't that do what you want?
[07:36:52] <Guddu> gyzmodo, Could you help me please?
[07:37:23] <gyzmodo> Guddu, I dream about it! But I'm very in jQuery and JS
[07:37:32] <Guddu> gyzmodo, :)
[07:37:44] <SeanJM> lxsameer: $(element).is(":visible");

[07:38:46] <redsquare> is the bot still in this channel?
[07:39:04] <redsquare> ? tell redsquare hello
[07:39:04] <bot-t1> redsquare, Okay.
[07:39:06] <sts> SeanJM: no, that doesn;t work.. Uncaught ReferenceError: selectTag is not defined
[07:40:34] <redsquare> sts - what do you want passing to that func
[07:40:35] <bot-t1> (1 min 30 secs ago) <redsquare> tell redsquare hello
[07:40:43] <SeanJM> sts: pass the selectTag
[07:40:49] <SeanJM> sts: I read that wrong
[07:41:19] <sts> redsquare: the bind should call selectTag(this); (this from the <a> POV)
[07:42:48] <sts> SeanJM: what do you mean with /pass the selectTag/?
[07:45:16] <sts> hmm. I'm going nuts with this. Can anybody help pleeease?
[07:45:25] <redsquare> so sts can you not just use self = this at the top of renderBrowser func then use self
[07:45:39] <SeanJM> sts: selectTag is a function right? And you want to select <a> and bind the click event right?
[07:46:15] <sts> SeanJM: selectTag is defined in my widget.
[07:46:25] <redsquare> yeah you need a self^^
[07:46:41] <sts> SeanJM: And when someone clicks the generated <a>, I would like to call the selectTag from my widget. :)
[07:46:51] <redsquare> link.bind('click', self.selectTag);
[07:47:01] <redsquare> then this inside selectTag is the a
[07:48:56] <sts> if I change the line to:                 link.bind('click', self.selectTag(this));
[07:49:08] <redsquare> no u dont need the this
[07:49:12] <sts> the function is called when the link is created.
[07:49:13] <redsquare> jquery will set that
[07:49:24] <redsquare> no just self.selectTag
[07:49:30] <redsquare> the brackets will invoke the func
[07:49:49] <redsquare> try http://pastie.org/private/j18pyo3nvhyukwnln4ag
[07:49:58] <sts> Ahhh! nice :) got it. Thank you guys!
[07:50:18] <SeanJM> sts: I just watched
[07:51:42] <sts> redsquare: but this is empty.
[07:52:28] <redsquare> hmm wait
[07:53:06] <sts> redsquare: or is it passed as the first argument? eg. function selectTag(e) { alert(e); } does something.
[07:53:29] <sts> redsquare: alerts [object Object]
[07:53:32] <redsquare> http://pastie.org/private/j18pyo3nvhyukwnln4ag
[07:53:41] <redsquare> link is a jq obj
[07:55:12] <redsquare> can u jsfiddle it sts so I can run
[07:56:16] <theBrettman> I want to make a plugin to edit lines in a css file but all I can find is about parsing when I want to edit it directly in the file. not parse it and reprint the whole file. anyone can advise me or point me to how to do it?
[07:57:09] <sts> redsquare: yes. thank you.
[08:01:43] <sts> redsquare: http://jsfiddle.net/4etvS/
[08:02:54] <theBrettman> I guess there's no one here
[08:03:17] <theBrettman> maybe later...
[08:07:03] <redsquare> sts works fine http://jsfiddle.net/4etvS/2/
[08:07:22] <redsquare> this is the anchor in selectTag func
[08:07:40] <redsquare> just be careful trying to add dom attributes to a jquery object
[08:07:41] <noobie25> how do i access a variable within a string?   for example:   $('#main').append("somestring $myvar ");
[08:07:58] <redsquare> noobie25 $('#main').append("somestring " + $myvar);
[08:08:42] <noobie25> redsquare:  whoops....thanks!  did'nt mean to send to you via message.  using a new ui.
[08:10:55] <SeanJM> redsquare: I added a table to a variable, how would I select each <td>?
[08:11:04] <sts> redsquare: thank you
[08:11:25] <redsquare> .find('td') SeanJM
[08:11:45] <redsquare> sts no problem
[08:13:22] <SeanJM> redsquare: I guess that works for what I need. Thanks
[08:13:32] <sts> redsquare: btw. jsfiddle is pretty nice. :)
[08:14:16] <redsquare> SeanJM: did you have something else in mind
[08:14:21] <redsquare> sts: great tool ya
[08:15:05] <SeanJM> redsquare: I wanted the equivalent of each, although it may be totally un needed
[08:15:17] <SeanJM> redsquare: each(function(n)) kind of thing
[08:17:08] <redsquare> then .find('td').each(..)
[08:18:35] <SeanJM> redsquare: thanks, I'll try that out
[08:35:49] <Che-Anarc> I'm using a jQuery based image plugin with a lot of images... I have a an issue with Chrome & Safari where on first run only 1-2 assets become available & but 2 on the 2nd run all the images are present... is this something to do with the order in which I'm loading javascript files?
[08:36:01] <noobie25> because my json object has a dollar sign '$', i'm having trouble using it in my javascript.   for example:   var json={"$id":"100"};  id = json.$id
[08:41:34] <timwis> Anyone know how I can count how many items are in a JSON object like this? http://codepad.org/VwNwMzrI (item referring to the smallest child, with time & address)
[08:43:06] <Guddu> Dear alll...how could i close a modal form when the form action is successful after pressing submit? Please guide
[08:45:53] <dwatts> tinwis after loading the json into a function you use *yourjsonvar*.length
[08:47:29] <dwatts> example function audiofeed(data) { var feed = data.audio || []; for (var i = 0; i < feed.length; i++) { do something }
[08:48:02] <dwatts> where data is your json sent to the function, audio is the name assigned to my json objects
[08:51:30] <arashb> I'm returning some ajax which is returning javascript code that uses the live event. however, I'm getting the same event multiple times when the ajax returns again. how can i unlive() an event?
[08:52:33] <Kingsy> can someone tell me why this isnt getting run --> http://pastie.org/3184701 <-- if you include that exact same js inline it works
[08:52:48] <Kingsy> I assumed it was document.ready() so I included that in the function but it hasnt helped
[08:55:19] <Kingsy> I mean I could just include it inline but it just seems a little pointless
[08:57:09] <dwatts> Kingsy try putting and alert("run"); before the funtion to make sure that ready is running
[08:57:26] <Kingsy> dwatts: will do thanks
[09:02:25] <dwatts> Kingsy, did you get the alert pop up?
[09:04:20] <Kingsy> dwatts: yeah I think I have fixed it
[09:04:37] <Kingsy> totally forgot about using alerts.. it really helps
[09:10:44] <redsquare> use console.log over alerts
[09:11:02] <redsquare> alerts stop flow especially with ajax events, can give false positives
[09:13:24] <dwatts> I haven't come across console.log, thanks, great tip. I still like alert though as sometimes I need to stop the flow to track variables.
[09:14:21] <timwis> Anyone know how to take the JSON object on the left and get the HTML on the right? (varying depth :/ ) http://pastehtml.com/view/bkpzzlabs.html
[09:15:06] <redsquare> dwatts use debugger; then
[09:15:38] <Gorkyman_> what gallery plugin do you recommend?
[09:16:23] <dwatts> debugger?
[09:16:37] <redsquare> yeah
[09:16:45] <redsquare> debugger; - will break into your debugger
[09:17:10] <dwatts> I use firebug but to be honest it isn't agreeing with jquery at the moment.... too many error to log
[09:18:12] <redsquare> yeah - so a debugger; command will break into the script debugger without needing alerts
[09:18:25] <dwatts> Thanks
[09:18:57] <redsquare> http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/planet-mozilla/firebug-tip-disable-debugger-keyword/
[09:20:43] <dwatts> awesome, that will be really useful.
[09:30:12] <lxsameer> has chrome any issue with $.ajax and post data?

[09:32:00] <lxsameer> dwatts: ok thanks

[09:37:41] <delinquentme> hey all am I just nuts or do I (correctly) recall something being posted on hacker news about some JS exploit with lots of parens and curly brackets which could be used to basically run any JS on a website?
[09:40:52] <Che-Anarc> I cant understand what I'm doing wrong with DOM & jQuery plugin - in chrome my images dont load  / update until it get to the end or does some update?
[09:41:04] <dwatts> delinquentme pretty sure I would have heard of that, any more details?
[09:41:47] <delinquentme> i can tell you it was about 6 lines of code ... really obfuscated looking
[09:43:01] <delinquentme> im basically on this website thats paying people to find quick bugs and i wanted to futz w their app a little bit
[09:43:28] <delinquentme> i was seeing if I could somehow figure out what code they're looking for .. and or trigger a correct response to mess w them
[09:45:32] <dwatts> Sounds a bit immoral
[09:45:57] <delinquentme> dwatts, i make up for it by never having unclean thoughts
[09:46:56] <dwatts> ha ha ha, brilliant
[09:49:48] <delinquentme> whats the manner in which ajax requests can be appended to the end of a URL string?
[09:50:15] <delinquentme> its not  www.blah.com?fieldName="judo" right
[09:50:24] <Misiur1> http://jsfiddle.net/HK6gb/ what would you change in code?
[09:50:30] <delinquentme> dwatts, i promise you im being good haha this is just a qualifier round :D
[09:52:32] <dwatts> misiurl, what is wrong with your code?
[09:54:46] <Misiur1> dwatts: Nothing, just asking if I can change something
[09:55:16] <delinquentme> anyone?  I thought there was a way to do this ... in which ajax requests are effectively modifications to the url being passed
[09:55:42] <dwatts> to make it better or change its functionality?
[09:55:45] <gogo_it> Nivoslider and Fancybox issue: when I try to load a nivoslider inside a fancybox lightbox, my pictures never load.  If I try my link directly, it loads fine.  Any ideas?
[09:56:13] <Misiur1> dwatts: make it better, functionality later (because it requires server-side language too)
[09:56:39] <Misiur1> delinquentme: encodeURI
[09:56:53] <dwatts> where is the URL? within a function?
[09:58:05] <Misiur1> dwatts: url of image? Inside title. Why? Modern browsers load image even if I remove the src attr, so that's closest way to do it good
[09:59:16] <dwatts> sorry misiurl, I was talking to deliquetme
[10:04:23] <gogo_it> Can anyone offer advice how to start debugging a conflict between nivoslider and fancybox?  I can not seem to load a nivoslider for images in a fancybox.
[10:10:28] <gogo_it> does anyone know of another irc that might know more about fancybox and nivoslider?
[10:25:03] <manhunter> can i ask question about javascript?

[10:26:52] <manhunter> no i didn't
[10:27:25] <gogo_it> you asked if you ask a question about javascript, which is a question about javascript
[10:27:27] <manhunter> #javascript may be better

[10:33:37] <shwaiil> Q: How to focuc to a element like #name-of-element ? THanks
[10:33:49] <redsquare> $('#id').focus();
[10:33:50] <felixp> i have a div which is part of a portlet. How can i expend that same div and create a dialog without reloading the html?
[10:33:51] <redsquare> ? focus
[10:33:52] <bot-t1> .focus(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focus" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[10:34:49] <shwaiil> redsquare: tjs u0kk try it
[10:34:53] <shwaiil> thanks
[10:36:17] <tomasm-> redsquare, for a bug tracking system, sometimes people see odd things on their screen and i would prefer a visual screenshot, but the html source will suffice if they dont have to do anything
[10:37:11] <shwaiil> redsquare: this will work for a element that I'm toggle to visible ? the stack is toggle() and then focus()
[10:37:20] <shwaiil> the page doesnt focus the element though :T
[10:37:37] <shwaiil> I mean forget it, there's an error
[10:38:02] <Putr> hi! I'm looking at the .unload event. I need to track a parameter when people leave the page (time in the video). Is unload relaible enough?
[10:39:35] <shwaiil> nah this is not what I want
[10:40:01] <shwaiil> Q: I need the page to move to a given element name="something", like the html name= works. Using the anchor #someName
[10:40:02] <tomasm-> Putr, videos are usually flash files, not sure if a flash object's internal values is accessible via JS at all
[10:40:14] <shwaiil> I remember doing that in JS, but can't remember how. Any tip ? Thanks
[10:40:23] <tomasm-> shwaiil: j(window).scrollTo('#foobar');
[10:40:31] <tomasm-> its a separate library tho
[10:40:36] <tomasm-> focus() is for form fields
[10:40:47] <Putr> tomasm-: i already have the data point, just need to save it on event. I've read the documentation page and it dosent look promising
[10:40:53] <shwaiil> tomasm-: ahhh tks for looking.
[10:41:35] <shwaiil> tomasm I can't do that by default in jquery the .scrollTo, right ?
[10:41:43] <tomasm-> rather, focus() will put your cursor in the input field but may not scroll the page, not sure
[10:42:04] <tomasm-> shwaiil, jquery core doesnt have a 'scrollTo', it has a 'scrollTop', totally different beast
[10:42:33] <shwaiil> tomasm, I see :P
[10:43:19] <kanzie> Im doing jsonSerialize() on a form and it generates a string which if I do a JSON.parse('my string') works fine but if I use the variable directly I get NaN for the value (supposed to be a date from date picker). I made a kind of proof of concept here http://jsfiddle.net/7LRtJ/
[10:43:26] <kanzie> any ideas would be greatly appreciated
[10:43:52] <tomasm-> scrollTo() lets you reference an item by any css ref, and even pass options like offsets, duration/speed, etc. jquery core only would let you change it by pixel amount anyway
[10:44:40] <kanzie> so in my example the date 2012-01-18 is sent but when I do JSON.parse on it I get NaN, however if I JSON.parse the string ('2012-01-18') it works… wtf
[10:45:19] <astropirate> kanzie: because 2012-01-18 isn't a number :p
[10:46:04] <felixp> ? hide
[10:46:04] <bot-t1> .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[10:46:53] <kanzie> astropirate: mm, but how would I go about it then. Cause I should be able to use the string and pass it to new Date()
[10:53:33] <TDJACR> I'm trying yto use .change(), but it only works when I put the code into the address bar or firebug, it won't work in between <script> tags
[10:54:52] <gar_onn> is in in a $(document).ready ?
[10:55:02] <gar_onn> TDJACR
[10:56:33] <TDJACR> gar_onn: Now it is :P
[11:02:24] <redsquare> why are people using doc ready still?
[11:02:27] <gar_onn> does it work now?
[11:02:46] <Eviltwin> Still?
[11:02:53] <redsquare> yeah
[11:03:09] <redsquare> load scripts at bottom, lose doc ready
[11:03:57] <Eviltwin> I don't think you get guarantees about what happens if you manipulate the DOM there
[11:04:08] <redsquare> sure you can
[11:04:24] <redsquare> the dom has parsed the elements above, so they are ready to be worked upon
[11:06:08] <Eviltwin> The document is still essentially being written at that point
[11:07:38] <redsquare> Eviltwin - have you tested this theory
[11:07:39] <Woet> does someone know a template completely based upon CSS for colors/theming?
[11:07:55] <Woet> it can use images and css3, but you must be able to adjust the majority of the theming and colors through css only
[11:08:07] <Eviltwin> redsquare: I've read about it and I think it's mostly an issue with older browsers
[11:08:07] <Woet> kinda like themeroller in jquery UI, but even more :)
[11:08:17] <Eviltwin> Some apparently just hoist the scripts
[11:08:24] <Eviltwin> So they'd be run before any of the DOM is written
[11:08:41] <redsquare> Eviltwin - never had an issue
[11:08:49] <redsquare> link?
[11:09:20] <Eviltwin> I'll see if I can find it
[11:09:44] <redsquare> are we talking ie4!
[11:10:32] <redsquare> all the perf tools tell you to put scripts at the bottom
[11:10:36] <redsquare> yslow etc
[11:10:54] <Eviltwin> But they don't tell you that it will absolutely be run after the DOM is ready
[11:11:23] <redsquare> but if the browser has parsed the dom element above it can be manipulated
[11:12:14] <Eviltwin> I don't think all browsers make that promise
[11:13:07] <redsquare> well i have never seen an issue
[11:13:15] <redsquare> or heard of one
[11:13:24] <redsquare> and cant find one on google
[11:14:04] <Eviltwin> I find lots of comments and blog posts that claim one way or the other
[11:14:09] <Eviltwin> But nothing that shows any data
[11:15:12] <redsquare> so you believe them then!
[11:15:46] <Eviltwin> All I know is that $(document).ready makes the promise that the whole DOM is ready
[11:16:01] <redsquare> so does having them at the end of the dom
[11:16:08] <Eviltwin> You claim
[11:16:13] <Eviltwin> Show me reliable sources on that
[11:16:13] <redsquare> I know
[11:16:33] <Eviltwin> So you've tested every browser?
[11:17:35] <redsquare> yep
[11:17:45] <Eviltwin> I see
[11:17:54] <Eviltwin> Well you should write a book about it
[11:18:05] <redsquare> why when its a well known fact
[11:18:52] <Eviltwin> It's a known best practice for speeding up loading but not a known guarantee for the DOM being completely ready
[11:20:47] <redsquare> have you tested it
[11:21:14] <Eviltwin> I don't have access to every browser
[11:22:44] <redsquare> ok, and no links to backup your claims
[11:22:46] <kborchers> Eviltwin: http://www.browserstack.com :)
[11:23:11] <Eviltwin> redsquare: Look who's talking :P
[11:23:40] <redsquare> I have proof, I have never seen an issue in the last three years
[11:24:06] <Eviltwin> Right, that's how we prove nonexistence claims. "I haven't seen it yet."
[11:24:19] <kborchers> for the most part you can put scripts at the bottom and you'll be fine but ...
[11:24:40] <kborchers> the issue you may run into is someone trying to interact with elements on your page before your scripts load
[11:25:17] <kborchers> as long as you are prepared for that, you can usually put scripts at the bottom and not use ready
[11:25:22] <redsquare> yes which wont happen if those scripts are at the bottom
[11:26:01] <kborchers> redsquare: what won't happen?
[11:27:54] <redsquare> well anything like that you use nojs+css
[11:29:08] <kborchers> which is what i meant by "as long as you are prepared for that, you can usually put scripts at the bottom and not use ready"
[11:29:51] <kanzie> no matter how I try to parse my form I get one field always becoming NaN though it should not be handled any differently than the others… http://pastebin.com/2JF2z5n9
[11:30:07] <kanzie> every other field is correctly strings except that one
[11:30:10] <kborchers> honestly, i have not seen solid proof either way. just throwing in my two cents
[11:30:19] <Eviltwin> redsquare: Crockford had a good way of putting this
[11:30:39] <Eviltwin> He was talking about using if(window.addEventListener) { ... } else if(window.attachEvent) { ... } else { ... }
[11:30:41] <redsquare> kborchers but the fact is that dom elements are ready for manipulation with scripts at the bottom
[11:31:10] <Eviltwin> And said, "It's kind of like a belt and suspenders. When working with the web, you just want to keep your pants from falling down."
[11:31:14] <kborchers> but what happens if there is a delay in loading your script after the elements have been presented to the user. there could be perceived brokeness
[11:31:27] <Eviltwin> Why not use document ready?
[11:31:43] <kborchers> i do ... just throwing things out there :P
[11:31:43] <redsquare> because it gets folk into trouble
[11:31:48] <Eviltwin> How?
[11:32:06] <redsquare> they end up with a whole execution order that is out of their hands and confuses them
[11:32:24] <Eviltwin> document ready confuses you?
[11:32:41] <redsquare> Eviltwin do you think that
[11:33:10] <IAmWill> is it possible to load an html page into a dialog box using jquery ui?  (ie.  <a href="page-to-load.html" id="the-page">Click Here</a> )
[11:34:06] <redsquare> yes IAmWill - setup a click handler to the anchor - do a .get to get the html then load it into the dialog contents and show the dialog
[11:34:09] <IAmWill> i was using colorbox, but it seemed to be very sloppy
[11:34:42] <redsquare> define sloppy
[11:34:46] <IAmWill> redsquare: thanks
[11:35:31] <IAmWill> well, i would like to do more than just load pages... ui offers more and seems to be more clean... (i just have to learn it)
[11:37:09] <redsquare> IAmWill if you just need to show some content in a dialog I would refrain from including all the bloat from jquery ui
[11:37:20] <IAmWill> This is day 2 for trying to use jquery ui, so far, what it offers is a one stop for everything i need to do.. (sliding div's, basic forms, dialog boxes)
[11:38:18] <redsquare> ok
[11:38:26] <IAmWill> redsquare: i only included the things I would be using in my download... but it's not just content in a box... there was a lot more that I will be using
[11:38:49] <redsquare> sure, if you need other features then great
[11:40:07] <IAmWill> redsquare: thanks for the help... i could get the dialog boxes to display, i just couldn't figure out how to display another page within it
[11:40:38] <redsquare> sure, you have to do the ajax fetch yourself with jq ui dialog
[11:44:57] <felixp> how can i move the div inside a .dialog to somewhere else in my page?
[11:47:03] <redsquare> felixp select it, then move using appendTo
[11:52:10] <felixp> redsquare: i tried with: $(formalId + " .portlet-content").appendTo($(formalId + " .portlet")); on beforeClose:
[11:52:16] <felixp> and it doesn't seem to work...
[11:52:55] <redsquare> is $(formalId + " .portlet-content") your dialog
[11:52:57] <felixp> i'm able to drag the content into the dialog... this works fine.. but when i'm trying to bring back the content to the portlet, it fails
[11:53:02] <redsquare> does the .length === 1
[11:53:05] <felixp> yes
[11:53:22] <redsquare> and $(formalId + " .portlet").length === 1
[11:53:44] <redsquare> doesnt seem right
[11:53:53] <redsquare> since its the same id
[11:54:02] <felixp> http://jsfiddle.net/GvVUr/
[11:54:34] <felixp> it's working fine to create the dialog (even the form data is intact)...
[11:55:32] <redsquare> but look at the append statement
[11:55:37] <redsquare> its appending into itself
[11:56:06] <redsquare> which, will never work
[11:56:12] <milardovich> Hello guys. I have this javascript file: http://pellegrinioscarv.com.ar/listaprecios/js/dialog.js and it works perfect, but when I load it with ajax it doesn't work anymore. Any suggestions¡
[11:56:13] <felixp> hmmm.
[11:56:14] <milardovich> ?
[11:56:39] <milardovich> I think the problem is the $(function() { ?
[11:57:20] <redsquare> oh doc ready issues - Eviltwin is your man
[11:57:35] <felixp> redsquare: how can i turn that?
[11:57:49] <felixp> console is giving me 0 for both .length
[11:57:54] <Eviltwin> Yeah, redsquare is confused by doc ready :P
[11:58:38] <redsquare> Eviltwin - dont see your skills coming out too much here
[11:58:50] <redsquare> felixp - not sure without see more context
[11:59:37] <redsquare> felixp you need to move the dialog back to its original parent
[12:01:06] <redsquare> milardovich how are you loading it via ajax
[12:01:27] <redsquare> milardovich have you setup tested it parses the script
[12:01:59] <redsquare> the doc ready statement should be an issue ssince it will be true and call the func inside
[12:02:05] <redsquare> shouldn't
[12:02:33] <cornfeed> where can i find a list of all the events i can bind to?? i have been searching for 20 mins+
[12:02:37] <milardovich> redsquare: I load it with a xmlhttp object
[12:02:58] <redsquare> milardovich does it parse the js?
[12:03:01] <cornfeed> all i have found is propertychange keyup input paste
[12:03:12] <redsquare> cornfeed for what element
[12:03:21] <cornfeed> an input type=textbox
[12:03:34] <felixp> redsquare: is there any easy way out? should i find it?
[12:03:59] <milardovich> redsquare: yes, I can use the other functions
[12:04:03] <milardovich> But that piece of coude doesn't wok
[12:04:05] <milardovich> work*
[12:04:21] <milardovich> And the web console of firefox doesn't say anything
[12:06:32] <felixp> console.log(  $(dialogId + " .portlet-content").html ); logs some jquery js
[12:07:29] <Eviltwin> jQuery uses methods, not properties of the jQuery object
[12:08:42] <redsquare> felixp - if $(dialogId + " .portlet-content").length === 0 then this is your issue
[12:09:05] <redsquare> felixp can you mock the page up at jsfiddle
[12:09:05] <Eviltwin> .html() to get the HTML content
[12:09:32] <redsquare> the html will be zip if the length is 0 felixp
[12:09:37] <Eviltwin> ?.html @ felixp
[12:09:54] <Eviltwin> Ugh, bot's gone again
[12:09:55] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:10:40] <redsquare> ? html @felixp
[12:10:56] <Eviltwin> ?.html @ felixp
[12:11:01] <redsquare> worked before
[12:11:05] <redsquare> ? tell redsquare hi
[12:11:06] <bot-t> felixp, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:11:07] <bot-t> redsquare, Okay.
[12:11:34] <felixp> redsquare: i updated http://jsfiddle.net/GvVUr/1/ with html context
[12:13:59] <felixp> redsquare: do you want the other js code?
[12:16:29] <redsquare> no
[12:16:30] <bot-t> (5 mins 24 secs ago) <redsquare> tell redsquare hi
[12:16:36] <redsquare> ok when you create the dialog
[12:16:49] <redsquare> it takes the element and places it as a child of the body
[12:16:58] <redsquare> so your selector will no longer be valid
[12:17:04] <redsquare> using the parent id
[12:18:02] <felixp>  $(this).parents(".portlet:first").attr('id');
[12:18:03] <felixp> ?
[12:18:26] <redsquare> what version of jq are you using
[12:18:40] <felixp> 1.7.1
[12:19:01] <Eviltwin> ?.closest
[12:19:02] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:19:04] <felixp> UI 1.8.16
[12:19:45] <redsquare> felixp ok try http://jsfiddle.net/GvVUr/3/
[12:20:32] <redsquare> http://jsfiddle.net/GvVUr/4/ was missing a quote
[12:20:58] <redsquare> felixp it uses closest and stops all the repeated selectors
[12:23:29] <felixp> redsquare: thank's, it works! but, when i'm trying to get the dialog back on, it does not work...
[12:24:23] <redsquare> what, when you click it again
[12:24:47] <cornfeed> ok i tried every event selector I could find, and it was quite a long list. is there some magical way to detect is another jquery function is affecting the value of an input??
[12:25:04] <felixp> yes, it opens an empty dialog. then, when i close it, it works fine at bringing back the content in the portlet
[12:25:47] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: There's a change event
[12:26:10] <cornfeed> tried that, nothing
[12:26:23] <Eviltwin> Yeah, don't think it fires when changed programatically
[12:26:48] <cornfeed> it is a color-picker text box, and after the plugin is submited, the text box changes to the selected color. that is not triggering .change
[12:27:31] <andddr> Can any body suggest how to create a new widged inheriting all features of core UI widget?
[12:27:41] <Eviltwin> Use the onChange
[12:27:47] <Eviltwin> This plugin? http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/
[12:28:26] <cornfeed> you got it
[12:28:36] <cornfeed> needs to be capitalized?
[12:28:40] <Eviltwin> Scroll down to the bottom
[12:28:52] <Eviltwin> There's an example of using onChange
[12:29:08] <felixp> redsquare: that's weird.
[12:29:09] <cornfeed> well slap me witha wet noodle
[12:30:28] <cornfeed> hehehehe $(el).trigger('change');
[12:30:39] <cornfeed> thanks very much
[12:31:37] <redsquare> felixp - yeah it carries over all the css and classnames
[12:32:29] <felixp> and if i add a breakpoint at the click function, it is never triggered again
[12:32:34] <redsquare> felixp what I would do is have a single jquery dialog - and just copy the markup from the portlet to the dialog
[12:33:16] <felixp> redsquare: but that would not keep the form informations, etc?
[12:34:20] <felixp> redsquare: the content of the portlet is ajax populated, so that solution would be easy... but if the user is working some stuff in the portlet, needs more space and maximize into the dialog, he would lose everything... :\
[12:35:02] <redsquare> ok 1 min
[12:35:30] <b1lly> anyway to check in an array for a value without having to loop thru ti?
[12:35:38] <Eviltwin> No
[12:36:48] <Eviltwin> If it makes sense, you could store it as an object instead
[12:36:56] <Eviltwin> Where you map the values to something
[12:37:07] <Eviltwin> Depends on your usecase
[12:37:35] <b1lly> i just have an array of values
[12:37:41] <b1lly> that later i want to see if the value exist
[12:38:01] <felixp> !!~array.indexOf('key');
[12:38:23] <Eviltwin> ?.inArray @ b1lly
[12:38:23] <bot-t> b1lly, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[12:38:54] <redsquare> felixp http://jsfiddle.net/GvVUr/7/
[12:40:53] <felixp> redsquare: wow! it's working smoothly :)
[12:40:57] <felixp> many thank's
[12:41:37] <redsquare> np
[12:42:24] <felixp> children() gets the closest child (in this case, div?)
[12:42:43] <redsquare> gets all children
[12:42:59] <redsquare> could just say html there i guess
[12:42:59] <felixp> ok, and  $('<div/>'). ?
[12:43:18] <redsquare> that creates a div to append the content into to use as the dialog
[12:43:34] <redsquare> so all the css and crap get added to that not the portal content div
[12:43:51] <Che-Anarc> I'm having issues with dynamically loading jQuery via another .js file - the flow of load & order in which jQuery() - functions are being called - is there anyway to ensure that var tag=document.createElement("script");    is created before other stuff is called?
[12:44:02] <felixp> great! thank's again
[12:44:42] <redsquare> felixp good luck with it
[12:46:23] <b1lly> if ($.inArray(orderId, allOrdersResult) < 0)            /// looking to see if orderId doesn't exist in the allOrdersResult array
[12:46:29] <b1lly> and its returning -1 for everything
[12:46:32] <b1lly> even if it does
[12:46:44] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ b1lly
[12:46:45] <bot-t> b1lly, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:53:13] <b1lly> is there away to do like myarray[key].destroy
[12:53:22] <Eviltwin> ?
[12:53:29] <Eviltwin> To remove an item from an array?
[12:53:31] <b1lly> the only problem is the array stores a object... i just want to remove the
[12:53:32] <b1lly> ya
[12:53:36] <Eviltwin> Or remove a key from an object
[12:53:41] <b1lly> remove the array
[12:53:46] <Eviltwin> You want to use .splide
[12:53:46] <b1lly> based on the key
[12:53:48] <Eviltwin> .splice*
[12:53:55] <Zerxer> arrays don't have keys
[12:53:57] <Eviltwin> array.splice(index,1)
[12:54:02] <Zerxer> json objects do
[12:54:08] <b1lly> associative arrays?
[12:54:10] <Zerxer> which you'd use delete myobj[key]
[12:54:11] <Eviltwin> Objects do
[12:54:16] <b1lly> oh
[12:54:18] <Eviltwin> That's why I asked
[12:54:19] <Zerxer> javascript doesn't have associate arrays, those are objects
[12:54:25] <Eviltwin> you answered wrong :P
[12:54:26] <Zerxer> associative
[12:54:31] <b1lly> ah
[12:54:37] <b1lly> so to reove the object
[12:54:39] <b1lly> based ont he key
[12:54:57] <b1lly> delete myobj[key] is it?
[12:55:01] <Eviltwin> This is why I asked for a jsfiddle demo
[12:55:03] <Zerxer> yea
[12:56:46] <Che-Anarc> I'm having issues in Chrome with jQuery plugin... is there anyway to load jQuery dynamically & once load is complete do init() function?
[12:57:13] <cornfeed> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[12:57:46] <cornfeed> onload is well, for once jquery is loaded, ready is for once the DOM is fully loaded
[12:58:09] <redsquare> Che-Anarc when are you loading jquery?
[12:58:45] <Che-Anarc> redsquare   I'm loading in   file1.js  - file2_isplugings.js, etc.
[12:59:15] <redsquare> Che-Anarc so you copied jquery into your own file
[12:59:24] <Che-Anarc> redsquare  yes
[12:59:32] <redsquare> why not use a cdn version, then just make sure your plugin is included after
[13:00:04] <Che-Anarc> redsquare  no sorry I'm creating via:  var tag=document.createElement("script");
[13:00:40] <redsquare> any reason? you could use yepno or require if you want async loading
[13:00:41] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to dynamically include jQuery?
[13:01:02] <Che-Anarc> Eviltwin   yes.
[13:01:07] <Eviltwin> There's this for using jQuery in a bookmarklet: see ?bookmarklet
[13:01:07] <bot-t> http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/
[13:01:12] <Eviltwin> You could poke at how it works
[13:01:17] <Eviltwin> It's not too complicated
[13:02:05] <Che-Anarc> Eviltwin  was that for me?
[13:02:31] <Eviltwin> Yes...
[13:03:52] <samol> hello, how can I put my link into article element? http://jsfiddle.net/EYsup/14/
[13:04:14] <Eviltwin> Where in the article?
[13:04:16] <yedimind> not like that
[13:04:46] <samol> eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/EYsup/14/ here's the code
[13:05:02] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I saw that
[13:05:15] <samol> I got <article> element
[13:05:29] <Eviltwin> You can put it a the beginning, the end, or replace the contents with it
[13:06:02] <tw2113> samol just as a test, i did alert(link); and it's showing undefined
[13:06:26] <samol> any idea why it is undefined?
[13:07:04] <Zerxer> yes
[13:07:21] <Zerxer> you need to do $("a").click(function(){ //now this will work })
[13:07:25] <Zerxer> or do album(this);
[13:07:28] <Zerxer> pass it along
[13:07:43] <Zerxer> doing onclick="function()" isn't going to have 'this' in function
[13:08:22] <samol> thanks
[13:08:53] <Zerxer> samol: alternatively you could do onclick="album.call(this);"
[13:09:02] <Eviltwin> Messy though
[13:09:03] <Zerxer> that should pass this along as the function's 'this'
[13:09:04] <Zerxer> yeah
[13:09:06] <samol> that would be better
[13:09:11] <samol> I'm using some ajax
[13:09:22] <Zerxer> and
[13:09:25] <Eviltwin> It's better to not mix HTML and JavaScript using onclick etc.
[13:09:32] <Eviltwin> It's considered a bad practice to use onclick
[13:09:36] <Zerxer> yea you should just do .click()
[13:09:37] <samol> that's why I put onclick, because after load() the script wasnt working
[13:09:43] <Zerxer> if you mean those links are added dynamically
[13:09:49] <Zerxer> then do .live('click', function)
[13:09:53] <Eviltwin> No
[13:09:56] <Eviltwin> Don't do .live
[13:09:58] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[13:10:00] <Zerxer> is it?
[13:10:03] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:10:03] <Zerxer> how long have I been out of here :(
[13:10:16] <Zerxer> what's recommended now?
[13:10:37] <Eviltwin> Rather than $("foo").live("event", function(){...}) you can do $(document).delegate("foo", "event", function(){...})
[13:10:46] <Eviltwin> To produce the same result
[13:10:52] <Eviltwin> See ?.delegate
[13:10:53] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:10:56] <samol> I'll check this
[13:11:07] <Eviltwin> Or if you're using 1.7+, use .on which has almost the same syntax
[13:11:14] <Eviltwin> Just flip the "foo" and "event"
[13:11:35] <oal> Is there an example widget for jquery ui in coffeescript somewhere?
[13:11:59] <samol> ok. so i have some readings now. thanks
[13:12:08] <Eviltwin> Eww...CoffeeScript
[13:12:55] <Zerxer> so what does live do differently that it's no longer recommended?
[13:13:06] <Zerxer> syntax is certainly shorter
[13:13:06] <Eviltwin> It does two things
[13:13:13] <Eviltwin> A) The syntax is misleading
[13:13:32] <Eviltwin> B) It selects all the things that currently match the selector and then throws that selection away
[13:13:39] <Eviltwin> Answer me this
[13:13:42] <Eviltwin> Without looking it up
[13:13:46] <Eviltwin> How does .live work?
[13:14:20] <Zerxer> when a click is made it checks if it matches any selectors that were given to it
[13:14:32] <Zerxer> which yeah the delegate syntax makes that more apparent
[13:14:35] <Eviltwin> How does it know when clicks happen
[13:14:37] <Eviltwin> Right
[13:14:39] <Zerxer> but I never got confused by it
[13:14:45] <Zerxer> ah well
[13:14:47] <Eviltwin> Most people do
[13:14:53] <Eviltwin> So B applies to you
[13:16:01] <Zerxer> you are a god evil twin
[13:16:02] <Zerxer> good*
[13:16:12] <Eviltwin> God works too
[13:16:47] <Zerxer> God's evil twin
[13:17:01] <Zerxer> would that make you satan
[13:18:11] <Eviltwin> Perhaps
[13:25:30] <IAmWill> redsquare: now that I am thinking about it.. I am creating a login system with jquery ui within codeigniter... instead of trying to load a view into a jquery ui dialog.. wouldn't it be smarter to just create a dialog window with the form and pass the data to to the model?
[13:31:59] <Hierofant> http://sopastrike.com/
[13:32:45] <b1lly> to destroy multiple elements at once, is it wrong to do something like $('#boom, #bam, #bing').remove();

[14:50:44] <Renegade001> Is possible to just build the jQuery AJAX part?
[14:52:10] <redsquare> Renegade001 dont understand
[14:52:39] <Renegade001> I mean, just the jQuery $.ajax and related functions?
[14:53:09] <Renegade001> I'd probably have to take the core like .extend and .each but otherwise, would it be possible without grabbing too much of the library?
[14:56:02] <redsquare> oh, they were looking into it being able to do that, sadly not ye
[14:58:01] <redsquare> Renegade001 what about http://zeptojs.com/
[14:58:58] <Renegade001> redsquare: Yeah, I was looking at that but I'm really just looking for the AJAX-ibility
[14:59:56] <Renegade001> I know I'm being picky but I'm not going to be using any other parts of the library so it seems like a waste
[15:00:22] <Renegade001> I suppose it's time to see how this AJAX stuff actually works
[15:00:48] <danzik17> Renegade001: i'm sure you can do a custom build if you identify what ajax depends on.  at a minimum, its going to be core, callbacks, deferred, events.
[15:00:49] <Renegade001> XHttpRequest or something isn't it?
[15:01:32] <Renegade001> danzik17: The deffered object?
[15:01:55] <Renegade001> I think I might travel back up up a few versions and take the earliest stable AJAX functionality
[15:02:11] <BinaryKitten> Renegade001 what are you after?
[15:02:42] <Renegade001> BinaryKitten: Literally just an AJAX library similiar to jQuery
[15:03:05] <BinaryKitten> similar? there isn't anything similar
[15:03:21] <BinaryKitten> but if you're just after ajax stuff you might look at porter
[15:04:10] <BinaryKitten> Renegade001 https://github.com/hij1nx/Porter
[15:05:41] <Renegade001> Wow, that's nice
[15:06:22] <BinaryKitten> it works well too
[15:06:56] <Renegade001> Thank you BinaryKitten, this should work well
[15:06:59] <BinaryKitten> urObject.callname({item:stuff}, function() {})
[15:07:10] <BinaryKitten> not jquery but works well alongside it
[15:10:43] <danzik17> right, but if you're going to include jquery, may as well use its ajax libs imo.
[15:13:01] <BinaryKitten> danzik17 true, but porter does offer a little bit more veratility   eg it takes a lot more to do PUT, HEAD or DELETE type requests
[15:13:18] <BinaryKitten> *versatility
[15:18:22] <danzik17> BinaryKitten: what do you mean?  using those request types in jQuery looks relatively easy, though i havent't done it so far.
[15:18:54] <BinaryKitten> it is, but still really long code to do it quickly in multiple places
[15:19:32] <BinaryKitten> not saying it's impossible to do with jQuery's $.ajax  but it's not quite as nice
[15:23:51] <balr0g> can anybody tell me why the BIG images doesn display when mouseover() here: http://server066.elretohtml5.com/v02/modulo09/resumen/actividad17/m09ractividad17tarea1.html
[15:26:45] <jrockjiggz> balro0g: your selectors are incorrect: e.g. $("hiddendiv1")   should be $("#hiddendiv1")
[15:27:12] <jrockjiggz> ps: use jsfiddle
[15:27:35] <Tobbi> Hey. Imagine, I have the following DOM tree: pastebin.mozilla.org/1449481. How do  select everything from the first h1, but not the second h1? Like, I want the contents that belong to those headings.
[15:30:52] <xwurf> hi, can someone help please: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/534934/
[15:31:02] <xwurf> it seems $data[myname] is not evaulted
[15:31:10] <xwurf> because i get in any case: Yii::t("dictionary","_really_really_sure?")
[15:31:17] <xwurf> (statement is used within another " ")
[15:31:23] <xwurf> (which is used in another ' ') :P
[15:31:59] <balr0g> jrockjiggz, tks, stupid error
[15:32:11] <snover> xwurf: that code is php, not javascript
[15:32:13] <snover> I mean
[15:32:20] <snover> it is some amalgam
[15:32:31] <snover> but definitely not a jquery question
[15:32:59] <xwurf> yes, but there is no javascript channel here, right? ^^
[15:33:10] <Tobbi> Ah, I think I might want nextUntil.
[16:08:08] <Eviltwin> muzone: Did that paycheck come through? :P
[16:08:23] <muzone> yoyo
[16:08:28] <muzone> no, this week hopefully
[16:08:45] <muzone> i haven't forgotten you, you can be sure of that
[16:09:49] <muzone> Eviltwin: any thoughts about coming to polynesia though?
[16:10:05] <muzone> http://www.sofitel.com/gb/discovering-sofitel-hotel/french-polynesia.shtml
[16:10:45] <Eviltwin> Too busy to travel any time in the next month or two
[16:14:05] <muzone> cool
[16:14:24] <muzone> the keys are waiting for you though
[16:16:10] <muzone> Hey by the way, at http://jsfiddle.net/WHxhx/28/ - what's the best way of animating the length of the menu (not its dropdowns) as one clicks its various links?
[16:16:13] <muzone> Should I add .animate("fast") or something to element.removeClass("on-hover").addClass("off-hover");?
[16:16:52] <Eviltwin> See ?.slideUp and see ?.slideDown
[16:16:52] <bot-t> .slideUp([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideUp/
[16:16:52] <bot-t> .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[16:17:12] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, for the width?
[16:17:14] <muzone> i mean like vertical sliding
[16:17:15] <muzone> yup
[16:17:46] <Eviltwin> Not sure what the best way to do that off hand would be
[16:18:09] <Eviltwin> I've seen it done a number of different ways, none of which I was really happy with
[16:18:22] <muzone> nice
[16:18:35] <muzone> think you can help me after i send you your money?
[16:18:45] <muzone> i mean
[16:18:48] <muzone> no rush
[16:18:57] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I can take a look then
[16:19:04] <muzone> sweet
[16:22:57] <callen> does anyone know of a pure jquery widget that lets you input text and get a widget list of all your inputs with little delete buttons on them?
[16:23:04] <callen> doesn't have to be inline, but similar to a tag list interface.
[16:28:33] <Eviltwin> callen: Like this? http://jsfiddle.net/p6967/
[16:28:41] <Eviltwin> Gotta go, sorry
[16:28:54] <Eviltwin> I coded that up just now
[16:29:23] <muzone> callen: the best damn js you'll ever see
[16:29:28] <muzone> have a good one Eviltwin
[16:29:33] <muzone> easy on the drinks now ya hear :p
[16:41:16] <disappearedng> Hey what is "this" binded to in jquery.click?
[16:41:31] <callen> that
[16:42:47] <disappearedng> anyone?
[16:43:54] <BinaryKitten> nothing disappearedng
[16:44:12] <BinaryKitten> if you mean what is it bound to in the callback when the event is triggered
[16:44:13] <disappearedng> then how do I access the element that has been clicked
[16:44:30] <BinaryKitten> it's the same as any other event, it's the actual dom element
[16:44:46] <callen> I liked my answer better.
[16:45:04] <BinaryKitten> callen it was precise and to the point
[16:45:14] <callen> I am a master of concision.
[16:45:21] <BinaryKitten> but unfortunately not many people under the this/that dichotomy
[16:45:35] <callen> alas
[16:45:46] * callen turns up the music and goes back to working
[16:46:24] <Shai-Tan> I have a bunch of buttons which belong to a class. Each has an ID. How do I get the ID of the button that was pushed?
[17:18:08] <cylence> is there a good plugin for getting placeholder text working in older browsers - specifically for use on elements added to the DOM after the initial load.
[17:27:37] <someprimetime> cylence: http://jsfiddle.net/YPWQA/
[17:29:07] <cylence> someprimetime: interesting approach. I've been working toward allowing default functionality where possible using modernizr
[17:29:33] <cylence> someprimetime: do you think it's worth just ditching existing addons in exchange for a custom solution like this?
[17:29:44] <cylence> someprimetime: thank you, by the way.
[17:30:04] <someprimetime> cylence: i'd personally use this because it'll be compatible with pretty much every browser. but then again if you find a way to do it with your plugin, by all means
[17:30:08] <someprimetime> it's all personal preference
[17:30:11] <someprimetime> and no worries
[17:30:23] <cylence> fair enough
[17:30:25] <cylence> :)
[17:30:49] <cylence> it's a real shame that plugins don't have something similar to .live() built in
[17:30:57] <cylence> that some don't, I should say.
[17:31:06] <cylence> I'm trying to use this one http://webcloud.se/code/jQuery-Placeholder/
[17:31:11] <cylence> but it has no reload function
[17:34:25] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live, use .delegate or .on
[17:34:43] <Eviltwin> They can do everything that .live does AND MORE
[17:35:00] <astropirate> Eviltwin, what are these "MORE" you speak of?
[17:43:22] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm building a jQuery Mobile app that fetches a large JSON object and uses it to create a nested list with recursion. It loads pretty quickly in my desktop browser, but seems to take a really long time in my Nexus One and Blackberry browsers. Is there something wrong with my code or is it just something that takes a while? Should I work off of static HTML instead? http://68.63.108.216/311dash
[17:43:27] <timwis> (click novo tickets)
[17:43:58] <cylence> Eviltwin: so where with live I'd do something like $('.thing').live('click', function(){ alert('clicked!') })
[17:44:27] <cylence> Eviltwin: with .on() I'd do $(document).on('click', '.thing', function(){ alert('clicked!') }) ?
[17:45:15] <timwis> Actually I just tried it without the .listview('refresh') and that sped it up a lot. Of course I need it to look like a jquery list...
[17:46:55] <someprimetime> ?.live @ astropirate
[17:46:55] <bot-t> astropirate, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:47:02] <someprimetime> woops
[17:47:16] <someprimetime> ?.on @ astropirate
[17:47:17] <bot-t> astropirate, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:48:21] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: i came up with a way to do finite scrolling
[17:48:35] <someprimetime> not the most elegant way but it works :P
[18:07:17] <Eviltwin> cylence: Yup
[18:08:02] <cylence> Eviltwin: cool, thanks. I used to be quite up to speed on the newest jQuery bits, but I've been on backend Rails work for the past year or two... feeling out of touch. Time to catch back up, it seems!
[18:18:56] <Liquide> hmmm this might be a stupid question, but cannot figure it out right now myself - any easy way to select x elements starting at nth(y) child?
[18:20:21] <Eviltwin> It shouldn't be too bad using a .nextAll() and a .lt(x)
[18:22:07] <Liquide> gimme a moment to look at the docs Eviltwin
[18:24:37] <Liquide> hmmm looks even easier if I use slice()
[18:24:48] <Liquide> thanks Eviltwin made me look in the right area :)
[18:24:49] <Eviltwin> Sorry, that's what I meant
[18:24:59] <Liquide> hey I found it still ;)
[18:25:00] <Eviltwin> :lt and :gt are pseudoselectors for .slice calls
[18:25:02] <Liquide> what counts in the end
[18:25:05] <Liquide> ah
[18:57:15] <black_warlock> how cna i check if inside a specified tag there is an UL ?

[19:49:31] <omatase> I'm sending a custom header back on ajax requests when authorization fails on the server. Using Fiddler I can see the header is being sent back in the response. The header looks like this: "REQUIRES_AUTH: 1". However when in the jquery "AjaxComplete" method the xmlHttpRequest object's method "getAllResponseHeaders" does not contain my custom header
[19:49:48] <omatase> any ideas why? Does jquery intentionally strip out non-standard response headers?
[19:50:44] <kborchers> omatase: why not just send back a 401?
[19:51:26] <omatase> kborchers: it has to do with a limitation of the server-side code
[19:51:45] <omatase> I had two options. One option was kind of a hack on the server side and involved sending back a 401
[19:53:03] <omatase> kborcher: if you're interested in the details, 401 is option two in the solution on this page and custom header is option 3. I am going the custom header route. ... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4198679/a-controller-action-which-returns-a-partial-view-inserts-the-logon-page-when-aut
[19:53:21] <Eviltwin> omatase: Have you read this? http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-getresponseheader-method
[19:55:26] <omatase> EvilTwin: looks like something the jquery developers would have had to follow. I'm not sure really how to follow it though
[19:57:00] <omatase> EvilTwin: for this request though, state === "resolved" and status === "200"
[19:57:09] <Eviltwin> Actually, it's out of jQuery's control
[19:57:16] <Eviltwin> It's a browser limitation
[19:57:20] <Eviltwin> Or restriction rather
[19:59:07] <omatase> ah, ok
[19:59:48] <omatase> so, are you saying that document you linked says browsers won't pass custom headers? I'm not sure what "error_flag" is and code point is a bit unclear too
[19:59:54] <omatase> hard for me to validate
[20:04:53] <omatase> Eviltwin: oh I see, are you saying jquery is just receiving the event, and not sending the event? That if it's not coming through it's because the browser isn't passing it? I can confirm the browser shows that responseHeader coming through with my custom header
[20:05:32] <Eviltwin> Try doing the XHR directly and see if the header comes through or not
[20:06:29] <omatase> Eviltwin, ok I will try and come back
[20:06:55] <Eviltwin> Have you tried getAllResponseHeaders ?
[20:07:05] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[20:07:11] <Eviltwin> getResponseHeader
[20:13:46] <timwis> Hey guys, I have a large nested list inside one of my jQuery Mobile pages. It's still taking incredibly long to load on mobile devices. On my blackberry it doesn't even load. http://68.63.108.216/311dash - is this a common jQuery Mobile problem with large lists? Or am I doing something wrong?
[20:13:49] <omatase> Eviltwin: When the ajax call returns two javascript methods are called: 1 - AjaxComplete and 2 - The method I passed in to the ajax request I submitted with jquery
[20:14:11] <omatase> Eviltwin: I *am* seeing the header on the latter, so the browser is passing it
[20:42:44] <Tamil> Thanks david....ur way of teaching jquery is excellent

[20:49:07] <Liquide> is there a specific jquery tools channel or can you ask about that stuff in here as well?
[21:20:34] <janthony> Any idea why jquery ui date picker thinks today is january 15th 2012, instead of january 15 2011?
[21:20:59] <kborchers> because it's 2012?
