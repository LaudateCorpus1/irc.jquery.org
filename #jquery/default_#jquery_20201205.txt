[05:51:33] <mulch2> can i convert a jsp file to a class file manually?
[05:52:41] <mulch2> i just wanted to make an edit to some code in a war file, then repack it.
[05:53:05] <mulch2> but i just edited the jsp, not realizing i wouldn't see any changes.
[05:59:43] <mulch2> or is it converted when the war file is created?
[06:02:41] <mulch2> i'm def out of my depths here, but i'm wondering if i just have to delete the corresponding class file of the jsp i edited before recreating the war. i'll try that.
[10:44:10] <shoky_> mulch2: wrong channel..
[11:25:52] <z1haze> is it possible to get the name of a function bound to an event handler?
[11:26:26] <z1haze> using `$._data($form[0], 'events');` to get the events, i want to iterate events to see if a particular function is already bound, and the function is named i just dont know how to referene that by name
[11:27:38] <z1haze> might be going about this the wrong way, but im just trying to make sure i dont rebind an event if its already bound.. i know i can do .off().on but trying to just not rebind at all if i dont have to
[11:30:35] <z1haze> i ther a better way to do this? https://bpa.st/C4XA
[12:14:57] <shoky_> just bind once..
[14:22:56] <z1haze> not that easy. i have to do it when a particular event is fired, and this event fires from different places that i cannot control
[14:22:57] <z1haze> thanks.
