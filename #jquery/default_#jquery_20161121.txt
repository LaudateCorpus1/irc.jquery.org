[05:09:49] <sonu_nk> Hi i want to convert this date('Y-m-d\TH:i:s', strtotime($_POST['von']."00:00:01")) in jquery .. wht is its equilent in Jquery from PHP ?
[05:16:02] <Cork> sonu_nk: have a look at moment.js
[05:16:27] <Cork> jquery doesn't provide any helper menthods for time modifications
[05:16:48] <sonu_nk> Cork, is this  "  moment('01/12/2016', 'DD/MM/YYYY', true).format() "  ???
[05:17:06] <Cork> have you tried it?
[07:41:44] <mar77i> hmm.
[07:42:34] <mar77i> animations.
[07:52:35] <mar77i> hmm, how would I slowly scroll an image over a certain time? say, 5 seconds from image-top at screen-top to image-bottom at screen-bottom?
[08:01:35] <decx> transform from 0 to -(imageheight-screenheight)
[08:13:01] <hellyeah> are you guys using npm?
[08:14:03] <frankiee_> hellyeah: Yeah but not for front-end
[08:15:08] <hellyeah> i wonder jqueryui could i install with npm
[08:15:19] <hellyeah> like npm install jqueryui --save-dev
[08:15:35] <hellyeah> then require("jqueryui");
[08:26:15] <mar77i> hmm. damn.
[08:27:14] <hellyeah> what happened?
[08:28:59] <mar77i> so uh, why wouldn't this work on msie8? https://ptpb.pw/JHGV
[08:29:25] <AdamPDotty> because
[08:29:43] <Joey__> if you $("#myID a").click(function() { ... }); on document ready and then later add elements of a to #myID will clicking them trigger this code or does it only work for items already existing at the time? I figure this latter, so if you call that again after adding items will there be overhead in destroying the old events and creating new ones?
[08:30:25] <Joey__> or would you get duplicate events firing?
[08:31:01] <AdamPDotty> yep, you could still use $('#myID').on('click', 'a', function(){...});
[08:31:43] <Joey__> oh so handle the click event for #myID that then filters on element a?
[08:31:50] <Joey__> never seen this syntax, cool
[08:32:00] <AdamPDotty> yep, because myID is already present
[08:33:52] <Joey__> "In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored."
[08:33:55] <Joey__> sweet, thanks
[08:34:41] * AdamPDotty blames Cork
[08:43:11] <mar77i> I can't seem to get it right
[08:50:40] <MikeD_> is it better to do $('<textarea>' + content + '</textarea>')  or $('<textarea>').text( content )  ?
[08:50:42] <AdamPDotty> just send a notice to use a browser for adults
[08:50:53] <Cork> MikeD_: the later
[08:50:56] <Cork> by a lot
[08:51:09] <Cork> the first is xss risky
[08:51:13] <Cork> the later is xss safe
[08:51:50] <Cork> content = '<script>// EXPLOIT</script>'
[08:52:05] <Cork> the first one will execute it, the later will show it as text but not execute it
[08:52:36] <Cork> well ok, not exactly but...
[08:52:38] <MikeD_> that's not the direction I thought "better" would be examined, but i understand
[08:52:47] <Cork> content = '</textarea><script>// EXPLOIT</script>' will :)
[08:53:20] <Cork> MikeD_: you can also just use .val()
[08:54:49] <MikeD_> can or should ?
[08:55:03] <Cork> .text() or .val() is as safe
[08:55:07] <Cork> so it is really up to you
[09:38:33] <nettoweb> Hello guys, can someone help me to rename field name when duplicating the row? Here's my actual code: https://jsfiddle.net/osnysantos/0uate47d/
[09:40:08] <hellyeah> you need to include jquery file first of all≈ü
[09:42:12] <hellyeah> where is #addDraw?
[09:42:59] <hellyeah> nettoweb:  it seems click event is not triggered
[09:43:22] <nettoweb> sorry, its working here: https://jsfiddle.net/osnysantos/0uate47d/1/
[09:43:43] <hellyeah> ah okey
[09:43:59] <nettoweb> can you confirm if its working?
[09:44:15] <hellyeah> yea
[09:44:25] <hellyeah> it created new elements
[09:44:31] <hellyeah> is that what you want?
[09:46:28] <hellyeah> i guess you want see name differently
[09:46:31] <hellyeah> am i right?
[09:46:49] <hellyeah> like frame_1, frame_2, frame_3, frame_4 etc.
[09:47:51] <hellyeah> why you created multiple element at once
[09:47:52] <nettoweb> yeah
[09:48:11] <nettoweb> each row have to have different input field names
[09:48:14] <hellyeah> each time i click add new row it adds "four elements"
[09:48:41] <nettoweb> yes, each row will have some input fields
[09:48:46] <nettoweb> 4 or more
[09:50:06] <hellyeah> let me check something
[09:50:07] <hellyeah> a sec
[09:51:16] <hellyeah> people here know better than me i am just suggesting some way to do it
[09:51:32] <hellyeah> basically you want to create element dynamically and give dynamic name
[09:52:03] <hellyeah> so part of the name of element must be static other part must be dynamic like "frame" + i;
[09:52:23] <hellyeah> i is the counter that will increase by one when you click add row each time
[09:52:39] <hellyeah> what i do is to create iinput element dynamically and append it to body
[09:52:56] <mar77i> hah
[09:53:03] <mar77i> I figured out what the problem was.
[09:53:44] <hellyeah> and each time you click you can append one more element and then you can use attr("name", "frame_" + i);
[09:53:48] <mar77i> the old browser is incredibly out of date when it comes to crypto. now I parse the thing and make it use http instead.
[09:53:52] <hellyeah> of course thats my suggestion
[09:58:49] <hellyeah> nettoweb:  i would do smt like that https://jsfiddle.net/gmb3u1au/
[10:00:21] <hellyeah> nettoweb:  may be you need another way to do it but what i do is https://jsfiddle.net/gmb3u1au/1/
[10:00:24] <hellyeah> hope it helps
[10:00:47] <nettoweb> not what I was looking for.. just incrment input field names
[10:16:11] <sinopia> Hello, I've been searching but I can set it working, I got this https://jsfiddle.net/o2fgausg/2/ the script works fine except the if need to find those exact string as a OR statement
[10:28:06] <verax5> im getting server erros every other sec
[10:29:22] <verax5> idiot hosting staff assigned no executable perms to all files
[10:29:42] <verax5> -rw-r--r-- 1 rootonun rootonun  128 Nov 20 20:46 admincp.blade.php
[10:47:46] <mar77i> you have two options:
[10:48:04] <mar77i> generate the items together with the event handler...
[10:49:28] <mar77i> ...and personally, I should scroll down my irc client to see the most current stuff.
[11:21:16] <lng> Hi! How do I store variable as global so I can refer to it eventually? Usually, I was using window.varName, but it does not work for me now. What am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/1khmnycw/2/
[11:23:24] <lng> resolved
[11:53:55] <robertmaxrees> heloooooo #jquery
[12:01:53] <jose3__> Hello world!
[12:02:07] <jose3__> I have a nested json array that looks like this: ["XXXXXX", "XXXXXXX", Object, "XXXXXXXX", Object, "XXXXXXX", Object, "XXXXXXX", Object]
[12:02:28] <jose3__> how would I go about counting just the objects in this array ?
[12:02:35] <robertmaxrees> instead of the strings?
[12:02:41] <robertmaxrees> filter and .length
[12:02:55] <jose3__> okay, so use filter + length
[12:02:58] <jose3__> thanks !
[12:03:07] <robertmaxrees> sure
[12:16:00] <hellyeah> nettoweb: was it helpful to you?
[12:57:22] <taplar> oh crap
[12:58:02] <v0lksman> hello all!  I'm trying to trigger an event when someone does a search on my site using Googles custom search tool. Something very similar to this question:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12673963/custom-search-engine-button-click
[12:58:38] <v0lksman> I know that .live was depricated in 1.7 but using 1.12.4 and switching to .on doesn't seem to bind.  Any suggestions?
[12:59:01] <taplar> try using a delegatew
[12:59:08] <taplar> without the 'q'
[12:59:10] <taplar> fk
[12:59:11] <taplar> 'w'
[13:00:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  what happened?
[13:00:24] <taplar> hmm?
[13:00:31] <hellyeah> oh crap :D
[13:00:42] <taplar> oh, i was trying to setup a joke, but no one replied fast enough
[13:00:52] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:00:58] <robertmaxrees> this guy.
[13:01:13] <hellyeah> is it an idiom also? robertmaxrees
[13:01:25] <robertmaxrees> yep
[13:01:31] <hellyeah> ah ic
[13:01:35] <hellyeah> what i wonder is
[13:01:50] <hellyeah> require('jquery'); is possible?
[13:01:50] <taplar> oh crap is like oh sh**
[13:02:06] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you mean can you use require with jquery?
[13:02:16] <hellyeah> or require("jqueryui);
[13:02:18] <v0lksman> delegate is also depricated in favour of on but it too doesn't attach.  The problem is the Google tool loads via javascript so I need to wait for it to be done I think
[13:02:20] <hellyeah> yes
[13:02:27] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman show us your code.
[13:02:30] <taplar> v0lksman: on() has a delegate version
[13:02:43] <taplar> on('event', 'childfilter', handler)
[13:02:52] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman it sounds like you're not using .on() correctly.  you can't just replace delegate with on.
[13:02:57] <robertmaxrees> there's a different syntax for it.
[13:03:14] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[13:03:17] <hellyeah> google for "understanding delegation"
[13:03:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events explains it.
[13:03:46] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ is good, too.
[13:04:29] <hellyeah> how about this https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:04:36] <hellyeah> oh crap
[13:04:37] <hellyeah> :D
[13:04:40] <hellyeah> sorry
[13:04:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:11:03] <v0lksman> so I'm doing this?  https://jsfiddle.net/6gqkfcd4/
[13:11:25] <robertmaxrees> almost.
[13:11:26] <taplar> for delegates you need to bind on a parent that pre-exists
[13:11:31] <robertmaxrees> searchWidget isn't a form there.
[13:11:40] <v0lksman> ahh...so I have it reversed
[13:11:43] <robertmaxrees> and i assume .gsc-search-hpx exists on pageload as a parent.
[13:12:00] <robertmaxrees> it's $(parent).on('event', 'child', function)
[13:12:13] <robertmaxrees> parent needs to exist on pageload though.
[13:12:16] <robertmaxrees> as taplar pointed out.
[13:13:14] <taplar> heh, to clarify.  -any- binding can only work if what you are binding on exists, :)
[13:13:15] <v0lksman> hrm...the .gsc-search-box appears onload...So I need another element?
[13:13:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> you need a parent that exists on pageload.
[13:14:02] <v0lksman> yeah the parent #searchWidget does.  the child form.gsc-search-box is loaded dynamically but on submit of that form is what I want to bind
[13:14:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah then flip those.
[13:14:41] <robertmaxrees> $('#searchWidget').on('submit', '.gsc-search-box'), function)
[13:14:46] <robertmaxrees> woops you kjnow what i meant.
[13:14:58] <v0lksman> yep....doesn't seem to bind though
[13:15:06] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> any console errord?
[13:16:14] <taplar> hellyeah: you haven't asked any questions in a while.  get that new job yet?
[13:19:11] <AlexP11223> How to start several GET ajax requests and do something when they all finished? But for each request if a request was succesful I need the  result text, and on fail I need some default value (such as ''). As I understand $.when can't do that
[13:19:22] <hellyeah> i didnt have a new job yet
[13:19:22] <v0lksman> no console errors but I've put it all in a fiddle:  https://jsfiddle.net/6gqkfcd4/
[13:19:33] <hellyeah> i had three interview with a company
[13:19:40] <hellyeah> i am waiting returns from them
[13:19:41] <robertmaxrees> AlexP11223 the first part is easy, the second part not so much.
[13:19:54] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman hit "update" and share the new code.
[13:20:02] <taplar> hellyeah: good deal
[13:20:48] <v0lksman> https://jsfiddle.net/6gqkfcd4/1/
[13:21:08] <hellyeah> i had an assigment, technical interview in skype and face to face interview with HR and technical like 2:30 hours
[13:21:32] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman and you only have the one #searchWidget, right?
[13:21:38] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i work with SVG in jquery?
[13:21:42] <MikeD_> hellyeah: was that fun or not?
[13:21:46] <taplar> no clue
[13:22:07] <v0lksman> yep.  as far as I know but in the code I sent for sure, and it still doesn't spit anything to console
[13:22:41] <robertmaxrees> something here seems weird.
[13:22:49] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:23:46] <hellyeah> MikeD_:  what?
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if their js is doing anything weird.
[13:24:01] <taplar> like stopping propagation maybe?
[13:24:01] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman do they have a callback you can use instead?
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> taplar maybe?  you don't have any handlers on the form though.
[13:25:19] <MikeD_> hellyeah: a 2.5 hour skype interview
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> something here seems really suspect.
[13:27:33] <taplar> is this fiddle supposed to function?  i don't see the search box or anything
[13:27:56] <v0lksman> taplar: did you go to the updated one?  https://jsfiddle.net/6gqkfcd4/1/
[13:28:11] <taplar> yup
[13:28:14] <taplar> all i see is the li dot
[13:28:48] <v0lksman> huh...that's weird..it renders for me, will check again
[13:28:54] <hellyeah> MikeD_:  sorry 2.5 hour was face to face interview
[13:29:06] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman so they don't provide any callbacks for this?
[13:29:16] <hellyeah> MikeD_:  skype interview just like 30 mins how to solve certain problem in oop
[13:29:16] <v0lksman> robertmaxrees: not that I can see in their docs
[13:29:22] <taplar> lol, it renders in chrome
[13:29:26] <v0lksman> the entire tool is pertty poorly thought out
[13:29:36] <taplar> that's hilarious
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> what's the tool here?
[13:29:41] <robertmaxrees> taplar works fine in ff here.
[13:29:41] <v0lksman> taplar: very weird...it renders the search for me
[13:29:57] <v0lksman> cse.google.com it's the custom search engine tool
[13:30:03] <taplar> ah ha!
[13:30:07] <taplar> ghostery strikes again!
[13:30:30] <v0lksman> they prodive a widget with results or you can build it all yourself with API calls...we've opted for the widget for now but it's very restrictive
[13:32:40] <taplar> $('#searchWidget').on('click', 'input.gsc-search-button', function(e) { works
[13:32:52] <hellyeah> jquery has something for d3js
[13:32:53] <hellyeah> ?
[13:33:14] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you need "input" there
[13:33:15] <hellyeah> ?
[13:33:24] <taplar> the class is on at least two things
[13:33:34] <hellyeah> hm
[13:33:43] <taplar> the input and the parent td
[13:34:03] <hellyeah> ic
[13:34:43] <robertmaxrees> wonder why submit doesn't work.
[13:34:58] <taplar> i'd have to assume they are stopping the propagation
[13:35:11] <robertmaxrees> but there aren't any handlers bound to the form.
[13:35:18] <v0lksman> grrrr
[13:35:26] <taplar> by the google library?
[13:35:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:36:10] <taplar> could the google library be using jquery to bind so it wouldn't show on the element?
[13:36:17] <taplar> how are you seeing no bindings?
[13:36:23] <robertmaxrees> the ff dev tools.
[13:36:28] <robertmaxrees> not looking at the jquery data.
[13:37:13] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:37:26] <v0lksman> very...and super annoying!
[13:37:32] <v0lksman> their docs on the matter:  https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/element
[13:37:42] <v0lksman> but I don't see a callback of any kind
[13:37:48] <robertmaxrees> yep already saw it.
[13:38:02] <robertmaxrees> gotta ask thogh - what're you going to do with the callback?
[13:39:20] <hellyeah> d3js in jquery
[13:39:25] <hellyeah> is that possible i wonder
[13:39:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:39:34] <robertmaxrees> you keep asking about that.
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?>
[13:39:41] <hellyeah> do you know d3js?
[13:39:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware of it, yes.
[13:39:59] <hellyeah> wonder is it possible to write d3js with jquery :D
[13:40:10] <robertmaxrees> "write d3js with jquery" doesn't make sense.
[13:40:34] <hellyeah> jquery has some function for wrapping native d3js?
[13:40:38] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[13:40:59] <hellyeah> anyway i will do a project svg included
[13:41:16] <hellyeah> for svg you use d3js if i understand correctly
[13:41:17] <JonelethIrenicus> hi
[13:41:27] <hellyeah> nvm me
[13:41:57] <v0lksman> robertmaxrees: I need to fire an event to close the mobile menu when a user submits a search
[13:42:15] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you're confused :)
[13:42:23] <robertmaxrees> svg != d3js.
[13:42:28] <JonelethIrenicus> in jquery ui when you have tabs that can closed how can you re-number them easily?
[13:42:30] <robertmaxrees> d3 just uses svg as apart of what it does.
[13:42:45] <JonelethIrenicus> like tab 1 tab 2 tab 3 and then some one deletes tab 2
[13:42:50] <hellyeah> yeah d3js use svg
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery does a pretty bad job of working with svg.
[13:43:00] <hellyeah> actually you make svg dynamic with d3js right
[13:43:15] <hellyeah> ah okey this is what i tried to grasp
[13:43:21] <hellyeah> so i will learn d3js
[13:43:27] <robertmaxrees> but remember, d3 != svg.
[13:43:36] <robertmaxrees> d3 is for charts and things.
[13:43:53] <hellyeah> d3 is for svg right
[13:43:59] <robertmaxrees> it's for data visualization.
[13:44:13] <hellyeah> hmm thats right
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> it happens ot use svg to accomplish that.
[13:44:31] <hellyeah> i will draw something with svg
[13:45:06] <hellyeah> when you click svg elements it will trigget ajax call and make data visualization in a table or graph
[13:45:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:45:18] <hellyeah> i guess i will use pure js
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> you can use D3 for that.
[13:46:00] <robertmaxrees> you have data vis going on thee - that's what d3 is for.
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman fair enough.
[13:46:48] <hellyeah> i see
[14:19:31] <v0lksman> uhg...I can bind to mouseout on the search field but not keypress of e.which == 13.  That keypress is never sent
[14:19:48] <robertmaxrees> there's something funky going on with that form.
[14:19:51] <v0lksman> so lame
[14:33:35] <decx> use the form luke
[14:34:38] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[14:42:06] <taplar> you know being a jedi and being able to see the ghosts, must be hard to get some 'private time'
[14:42:19] <taplar> if you know what i'm saying
[14:43:26] <taplar> awww, awkwardCough isn't present
[15:03:52] <Caspan> http://pastebin.com/6qscmPrq
[15:03:56] <Caspan> i have these 2 lines of code
[15:04:35] <Caspan> I want to completely replace all HTML inside the element with the ID ModalHTML
[15:04:55] <Caspan> this seems to replace text but does not replace child elements
[15:05:56] <Caspan> its a <p id="ModalHTML"></p> tag and i want everythign between the <p> tags replaced with my AJAX response
[15:06:37] <Caspan> would .replaceWith be better?
[15:09:02] <Caspan> i can do an .empty first the put my ajax in but i was just curious if there was a better way
[15:15:27] <MikeD_> Caspan: $("#ModalHTML").html( newhtml )
[15:16:40] <MikeD_> just curious, does your ajax result in only flow content?  because technically you shouldn't be putting div (for example) inside <p>
[15:17:16] <Caspan> Table HTML is returned
[15:17:26] <Caspan> and yeah that P shoudl be a DIV really
[15:18:47] <Caspan> there we go it works as soon as i make it a DIV
[15:18:55] <Caspan> but wouldnt work on a P elemetn
[15:18:57] <Caspan> weird
[15:19:09] <Caspan> working is working ill take it
[16:05:30] <qakhan> hi all, is there any method which i can use on table row selection.
[16:05:44] <qakhan> here is my code. https://jsfiddle.net/smr8L520/18/
[16:07:04] <qakhan> if a row (Group 1) selected in table (Groups) then add row from Extens table.
[16:07:58] <qakhan> if row (Group1) is not selected then no action occur
[16:09:49] <qakhan> currently if i select row (Group1) and unselect it then rows from Exten table is still going to Group table.
[16:27:38] <taplar> qakhan: the logic block at ln 27 is an issue
[16:29:35] <taplar> you are creating a new binding on that element, within another event handler
[16:29:44] <taplar> it will happen multiple times
[16:32:34] <qakhan> taplar line 27 should occur if groups table row selected
[16:33:20] <qakhan> if no row (Group1 or Group2 or Group3 ) selected then dont do any thing
[16:33:46] <taplar> none of which changes what i just said
[16:34:20] <qakhan> i am trying to add Exten table rows under selected rows on Groups table
[16:34:58] <taplar> again, ^
[16:35:32] <qakhan> like if Group2 selected then click on Exten table row to move it to under selected (Group2)
[16:36:14] <taplar> i understand what you are trying to do
[16:36:19] <taplar> i'm pointing out an issue
[16:37:33] <qakhan> i am sorry i did not get you point where are you pointing
[16:43:50] <hlve> god damn
[16:43:53] <hlve> sorry.

[17:02:42] <mada> hi, is it possible to force a <select> to display a disabled element, e.g. $(el).val('0') with 0 being disabled?
[17:02:49] <Guest73629> yeah I need it for each ul not all

[17:03:10] <taplar> i don't understand what you mean by that
[17:03:15] <Guest73629> I know thats why I need help
[17:03:17] <Guest73629> well

[17:06:11] <taplar> no
[17:06:18] <qakhan> taplar any thought on my question
[17:06:19] <taplar> you are doing a global lookup for the submenu to append to
[17:06:27] <Guest73629> errrr.......
[17:06:27] <taplar> why are you doing that?  'this' is already your submenu
[17:06:39] <taplar> :|
[17:06:44] <Guest73629> i don't fing know mate
[17:06:49] <Guest73629> \I just need a lil help
[17:06:55] <taplar> so fix that
[17:07:05] <Guest73629> not sure how
[17:07:11] <Guest73629> tried everything under the sun
[17:07:16] <taplar> append to 'this'
[17:07:25] <Guest73629> parent, first, children,
[17:07:28] <Guest73629> list goes on
[17:07:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wnnxpf1t/7/
[17:08:01] <Guest73629> yeahhhh
[17:08:04] <Guest73629> thats it!
[17:08:05] <Guest73629> cheers
[17:08:12] <taplar> how was that confusing?
[17:08:17] <Guest73629> ahh I get ya!
[17:08:47] <taplar> you were making an assumption that you were selecting more than you were
[17:08:55] <Guest73629> oh i see
[17:08:56] <taplar> instead of making an assumption, console log your variables to verify things
[17:09:07] <Guest73629> ok will do next time cheers
[17:09:43] <taplar> qakhan: i already told you what that issue that i saw was
[17:09:49] <taplar> look back up through the chat log
[17:10:43] <qakhan> i read what you said, but how can i add row after selecting the Groups table row
[17:11:24] <taplar> fix it so that you are not binding multiple times first
[17:28:23] <qakhan> taplar i may be need your help to fix it. how can i add extens table row click event under group table row click event
[17:29:11] <taplar> you need to only bind once.  you can delegate bind on the left table for the clicking on the rows
[17:29:32] <taplar> and in side there, find the elements on the other table that have that 'selected' class, or whatever you are putting on them.
[17:29:40] <taplar> and then you know which ones you need to append to
[17:31:03] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ is a decent page detailing the concept of event delegation
[17:48:43] <qakhan> can you please give me example of this
[17:49:20] <taplar> that page has examples
[17:49:57] <qakhan> i am already doing it
[17:51:30] <taplar> ok, so if you understand delegation then it shouldn't be difficult to change that binding inside the other binding to be a delegate too
[18:03:16] <taplar> more accurately, to take it out of the event handler that it currently exists in so it is not binding multiple times
[18:04:53] <qakhan> i put Groups table rows event inside the extens table row events
[18:05:16] <qakhan> here http://pastebin.com/1CGfN9aM
[18:10:04] <robertmaxrees> woah it's already 3?
[18:10:10] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[18:10:31] <taplar> ya, 5 for me
[18:17:46] <drej> 11:20pm
[18:50:47] <JonelethIrenicus> how can i change the id for a jquery ui tab div
[18:50:49] <JonelethIrenicus> ?
[18:51:18] <robertmaxrees> .prop(), but it may not work properly.
[18:51:23] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[18:51:40] <JonelethIrenicus> im adding and removing tabs and then i renumber them
[18:51:53] <robertmaxrees> why not just give them meaningful names instead?
[18:52:09] <JonelethIrenicus> since they are dynamically generated the tabs can get messed up with what content they display
[18:52:33] <robertmaxrees> also: why renumber?
[18:52:37] <robertmaxrees> the numbers don't matter.
[18:52:57] <robertmaxrees> the href just needs to equal the id for the div.
[18:53:04] <JonelethIrenicus> well they dont matter to me but i renumber the labels and i add them dynamically
[18:54:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused but ok.
[18:54:12] <robertmaxrees> you can use .prop() to change IDs bnut things may break.
[18:54:20] <robertmaxrees> you might need to reinit maybe?
[18:56:00] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: jquery ui doesn't have a way to automatically add and remove tabs does it?
[18:56:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to check the api docs.
[18:56:16] <robertmaxrees> did you?
[18:56:24] <JonelethIrenicus> ya i couldn't find anything
[18:57:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:57:09] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[18:57:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation
[18:57:44] <robertmaxrees> shows you exactly how to do it.
[18:59:09] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: yeah that isn't what I am talking about
[18:59:17] <robertmaxrees> how isn't it?
[18:59:21] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to add and remove tabs.
[18:59:24] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: that is just appending html to a tab
[18:59:25] <robertmaxrees> that shows you how.
[18:59:30] <robertmaxrees> nope
[18:59:44] <JonelethIrenicus> i mean like addTab(idValue, contentValue)
[18:59:45] <robertmaxrees> shows you how to add a full new tab.
[18:59:59] <robertmaxrees> right - that doesn't exist - you have to manually add the markup and then refresh the tabs.
[18:59:59] <JonelethIrenicus> i know how to do it
[19:00:01] <JonelethIrenicus> that is my point
[19:00:06] <JonelethIrenicus> I have to create the tab id
[19:00:22] <JonelethIrenicus> it doesn't handle it for me
[19:00:27] <JonelethIrenicus> even though it easily could
[19:00:31] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[19:00:32] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[19:00:38] <robertmaxrees> super trivial to do it yourself.
[19:01:10] <JonelethIrenicus> yeah unless i have like 15 tab items generated with dynamic tabs in each and user creatable tabs that can be deleted
[19:01:22] <robertmaxrees> still super trivial.
[19:01:22] <JonelethIrenicus> haha
[19:01:36] <robertmaxrees> same basic code.
[19:02:01] <JonelethIrenicus> well so far changing the id fails
[19:02:17] <robertmaxrees> you're updating the tab and the content, right?
[19:02:19] <robertmaxrees> and then calling refresh?
[19:02:36] <JonelethIrenicus> yeah
[19:02:40] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle?
[19:03:12] <JonelethIrenicus> it would take for ever or i would
[19:03:15] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:03:17] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:04:05] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/tn720vzq/1/
[19:04:09] <robertmaxrees> you're starting with tabs.
[19:04:20] <robertmaxrees> then you want to remove one, renumber the others, and update from there, right?
[19:06:07] <robertmaxrees> fwiw could you at least show the js you had?
[19:06:08] <JonelethIrenicus> ya add and remove tabs
[19:08:08] <JonelethIrenicus> https://repl.it/E4lS/1
[19:08:14] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: ^
[19:08:21] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:08:26] <JonelethIrenicus> everything works except the re-numbering of items
[19:08:27] <robertmaxrees> oh use .prop btw.
[19:08:30] <robertmaxrees> not .attr()
[19:08:36] <JonelethIrenicus> yeah i haven't cleaned anything up
[19:08:37] <robertmaxrees> and you never call the refresh in here.
[19:08:49] <robertmaxrees> ohj weird you do.
[19:08:56] <robertmaxrees> 'cause https://jsfiddle.net/tn720vzq/5/ works fine.
[19:09:37] <JonelethIrenicus> ok imagine this
[19:09:49] <JonelethIrenicus> you have 7 tabs and a user deletes tab 5
[19:10:06] <JonelethIrenicus> so you renumber the labels
[19:10:09] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[19:10:24] <robertmaxrees> tie that back to an object, update the object, and rerender.
[19:10:29] <robertmaxrees> ionstead of doing that all in the DOM
[19:11:35] <JonelethIrenicus> ill have to see the api then if that is possible but it is already working perfectly just need to grab the closest div with a specific id
[19:11:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:11:50] <robertmaxrees> which api?
[19:12:08] <robertmaxrees> 'cause the data object stuff you'd have to build out.
[19:12:12] <robertmaxrees> and you'd need some light templating.
[19:13:06] <robertmaxrees> you could di this all via dom manipulation but it'll be a big pain.
[19:17:32] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: yeah i really need to stop doing it that way i agree
[19:17:48] <JonelethIrenicus> but i already wrote it all out that way and it works except updating the div id
[19:17:53] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[19:19:19] <JonelethIrenicus> robertmaxrees: for example
[19:19:21] <JonelethIrenicus> https://jsfiddle.net/tn720vzq/6/
[19:19:36] <JonelethIrenicus> this method doesn't work when you have multiple sets of tabs
[19:19:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:19:42] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:19:46] <robertmaxrees> you're have to scope things down.
[19:19:52] <robertmaxrees> which is pretty easy to do.
[21:10:11] <Forbidd3n> Is scrollTop the position of the scrollbar from the top of the page?
[21:10:43] <Forbidd3n> so the very top of the page is 0 and as you scroll down it calculates from the top of the page to how far down the scroll bar has gone, correct?
[21:14:05] <MassDebates> Capturing digital signatures
[21:16:05] <MassDebates> thoughts or tips for me before i start heading the down the wrong path?
[21:16:55] <Forbidd3n> Hey MassDebates. How goes it?
[21:17:09] <MassDebates> Howdy.
[21:17:49] <MassDebates> And yes
[21:18:09] <Forbidd3n> When you scroll to the bottom of the page would scrollTop() be the same as $(body).outerHeight(true);
[21:18:13] <Forbidd3n> ?
[21:18:26] <MassDebates> Say an element isn't scrollable at all. Your value is 0
[21:18:36] <Forbidd3n> if it is fixed, correct?
[21:18:58] <MassDebates> Sorry I'm a bit drunk at the moment I have to read this
[21:19:11] <Forbidd3n> I am trying to calculate when to an element scrolls to the top of another fixed element and then untick the element.
[21:19:37] <MassDebates> So you're trying to figure out the relationship between the two?
[21:19:48] <MassDebates> Oh let me read your most recent msg
[21:20:22] <MassDebates> I might be in the wrong status for this, but what do you mean an element scrolls to the top of another fixed element?
[21:20:36] <MassDebates> 'untick the element'?
[21:20:45] <MassDebates> I only showed up, I can't scroll into what you've discussed before
[21:21:42] <Forbidd3n> I have a function that works if I put in a static number so the functionality works great, but can't figure out how to calculate the static number dynamically
[21:23:28] <MassDebates> Okay, did I miss a message or something?
[21:24:29] <Forbidd3n> no, why?
[21:24:58] <MassDebates> Can you show me the function?
[21:25:00] <MassDebates> do you have a codepen?
[21:25:29] <MassDebates> Was coming here, looking for some tips with mobile digital signatures.
[21:26:27] <Forbidd3n> MassDebates: this is my function with the scroll, resize and load code
[21:26:28] <Forbidd3n> http://pastebin.com/Bzn7rJ4C
[21:26:47] <MassDebates> So you're pinning something up?
[21:26:56] <MassDebates> WHy not use outerheight for the height of the pinup?
[21:27:08] <MassDebates> outerheight alone will give you the height of the element, padding and all
[21:27:12] <MassDebates> http://api.jquery.com/outerheight/
[21:27:32] <Forbidd3n> correct
[21:27:51] <MassDebates> If you have scrollable content, then https://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/ says you can use it to determine the scrollable content within
[21:27:56] <Forbidd3n> but that doesn't give the accurate px to unstick
[21:28:11] <MassDebates> ?
[21:28:18] <MassDebates> "doesnt give the accurate px to unstick"
[21:28:22] <MassDebates> paraphrase or elaborate
[21:28:47] <MassDebates> Are you allowing the user drag and drop, like post-its for windows desktop?
[21:29:50] <crashworks> Hi
[21:29:55] <MassDebates> Hi
[21:30:06] <Forbidd3n> MassDebates: no. I just have a fixed item bottom: 0 that is actually in the dom and when the bottom of the top sibling item touches the top of the sticked item then unattach sticky and scroll with page
[21:30:07] <crashworks> Does anyone know hat sort of effect this is, and how to recreate it in Jq? https://www.wetdesign.com/default.html#/experiences
[21:30:16] <crashworks> Hello MassDebates
[21:31:04] <MassDebates> I'm noping out of that one crash sorry
[21:31:09] <MassDebates> Too late for that crap
[21:31:16] <crashworks> What do you mean?
[21:31:41] <MassDebates> I mean that someone else may be able to answer your questions
[21:32:05] <crashworks> Why are you noping out of it?  Because it's flash or because it's a shitty effect?
[21:32:11] <Forbidd3n> MassDebates: do you see what I am trying to accomplish?
[21:32:14] <MassDebates> Forbidd3n:  I understand now.
[21:32:39] <MassDebates> Forbidd3n: 2 secs
[21:32:43] <MassDebates> Forbidd3n:  I fetch

[21:34:10] <Forbidd3n> let me take a look
[21:34:59] <Forbidd3n> end result is to fix item to bottom on load, and when scrolled to that point within the dom then unstick and allow item to scroll with page and restick when scrolling back up
[21:44:15] <Forbidd3n> MassDebates: still around?
[21:44:37] <crashworks> No
[21:46:28] <hellyeah> Forbidd3n:  position:fixed; ?
[21:46:59] <Forbidd3n> hellyeah: it is position fixed based on class attached and then I remove the class in the pastebin funtion I wrote
[21:47:01] <Forbidd3n> function
[21:47:53] <hellyeah> youƒ± should write that in jsfiddle
[21:47:58] <hellyeah> to see how it works
[21:48:06] <hellyeah> thats more helpful to others
[21:48:11] <hellyeah> they can help you more
[21:48:34] <hellyeah> if i understand you correctly you wanna remove "a class" in certain position
[21:48:37] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[21:49:57] <Forbidd3n> the element is in the html with a class stickit to fix it to bottom of browser window, when the top sibling item reaches the top of the sticked item then the class is removed and item scrolls with the page
[21:50:12] <Forbidd3n> and when scrolling back up then it hits that same point it resticks it
[21:52:16] <hellyeah> if you fiddle it may be i can help you
[21:52:22] <hellyeah> or others will do for sure
[21:52:46] <Forbidd3n> I can give you the site it is running on can I msg you?
[21:54:02] <hellyeah> small script is better if you ask me
[21:54:05] <hellyeah> i am not expert
[21:54:14] <hellyeah> but there is bounch of experts here
[22:01:50] <qakhan> i am tring to add exten table rows under groups selected row
[22:02:33] <qakhan> here is my code
[22:02:34] <qakhan> https://jsfiddle.net/81xd9uqo/1/
[23:36:16] <tash> drawing a blank here, how do I check if an input is empty?
[23:36:27] <tash> right now it's NaN
[23:36:37] <tash> I don't exactly know what that means though
[23:39:53] <tash> fabQty = $(this).closest('tr').find('.fabrication_qty').val();  I want to check if that is empty
[23:44:26] <tash> if it's NaN, then it isn't numeric right? So, can I just check to see if it's numeric?
