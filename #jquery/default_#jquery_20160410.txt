[02:32:13] <wa5ted> rather only safari specific
[02:50:27] <cluelessperson> Hi all.  I'm using jquery's "fadeTo" to fade some css to 1 or 0.5, the problem is that it seems to glitch the image slightly and it looks TERRIBLE for a moment while it transitions.  How can I fix this?

[04:00:14] <Adrian> hi
[04:01:01] <Guest15513> will it be possible to automate clicks on any given site? let's say I want to automate to create an email address on Yahoo! Mail
[04:11:10] <albedoa> cluelessperson post that fiddle
[04:11:44] <albedoa> looks like there are two logo images
[04:55:43] <saviobosco> Pls how can I use jquery.each() with input
[05:07:03] <yurakeshi> saviobosco: $('input').each(function(i) { $(this).val(i); });
[05:16:08] <no_gravity> Hello! Whats the proper way to add a click handler and later remove it these days?
[05:57:02] <saviobosco> How can I get the value of each matched element with $.val()
[05:59:09] <shoky> saviobosco: to get the values in an array you can use .map()  e.g.    .map(function() { return this.value })
[06:00:06] <shoky> well that gets a jquery object.  add .get() at the end to get the array
[06:01:53] <droidN00B> Hi all
[06:02:40] <droidN00B> I'm using the jquery datatable with the bootstrap css. I'm trying to position the scrollbar within the table instead of outside which is the default behaviour.
[06:02:47] <droidN00B> My fiddle is here
[06:03:12] <droidN00B> http://live.datatables.net/fopilode/1/edit
[06:03:17] <droidN00B> ANyone know how to do this ?
[11:12:50] <tash> is there a way to do window.location.reload() without getting the browser warning about submitting post data?
[12:10:38] <shoky> ideally the POST should respond with a redirect which will do a regular GET
[12:14:10] <tash> shoky: gotcha. Dealing with a different issue at the moment. I broke some stuff for IE that is working in FF so I'll have to come back to this in a few.
[12:26:54] <tash> shoky: I want to do a browser refresh in a button click event.  Just don't want the warning.  Is that possible?
[12:32:14] <shoky> tash: you can do  location.href = location.href;   but that's not too clean, and will still show the warning probably if user clicks back button
[12:32:42] <shoky> tash: like i said, the proper way to deal with this is have the server respond to the POST with a http redirect to a regular GET page
[12:32:53] <shoky> then .reload() won't cause any warning
[13:18:41] <nareshnk>  hi with this " var str='<input id="theCheckboxId" type="checkbox" name="theCheckBoxName" /><label for="theCheckBox">The text I want to change</label>'; console.log($(str).find('label').text('your new text'));" Why i am not getting result i want to replace label text
[15:19:59] <albedoa> nareshnk
[16:11:58] <_lazarevsky> hi all
[16:12:12] <_lazarevsky> is there a jquery library which allows you to easily construct expandable menus
[16:12:13] <_lazarevsky> ?
[16:35:54] <jerit> is .child() not the right function to select the nearest child element?
[16:49:25] <jerit> okay so $(this).closest("div").toggle(400); works, but I also need that to target the closest sibling div element, not its parent div as well
[16:51:53] <shoky> jerit depends what you mean by closest.  maybe you want something like .nextAll('div').first()   that gets the next sibling div
[16:53:57] <jerit> shoky https://jsfiddle.net/q003vy0v/
[16:54:01] <jerit> that might clarify
[16:54:08] <Devrim> I have set loginFirst=true; ssid=randomnumbers; username=randomusername; auth=1 as a var, how would I retrieve only randomusername?
[16:54:53] <jerit> shoky actually look at this one since I forgot to set that to jquery https://jsfiddle.net/q003vy0v/1/
[16:55:59] <shoky> jerit: $(this).find('.category-titles')
[16:56:29] <jerit> shoky thanks :) works nicely
[16:56:47] <jerit> interesting that it seems to shift the content up and down a few pixels on each toggle though
[17:01:41] <shoky> jerit: it's some css issue with how jquery ui is doing the animation, i forget the details. use css transitions if you want nice animations ;)
[17:02:59] * jerit totally forgot how to do that
[17:03:24] <jerit> its been so long lol I don't think I've touched css transitions since like 2013 or something
[17:04:27] <shoky> though animating height from auto to 0 might not work in css transitions iirc, so donno
[19:27:57] <docmur> I have the following code: https://jsfiddle.net/b83Los2y/  but what I want to do, is to select the value displayed in the select boxes instead of all the options, how do I make this edit?
[19:45:20] <xdevnull> Hello people, slideDown() require JqueryUI or standart jquery?
[20:15:21] <compact> hi. i have: http://pastebin.com/TqW1A6eU. how come the alert in the each shows nothing, however line 9 does
[20:15:47] <Cheaterman> hello sorry to disturb
[20:16:11] <Cheaterman> super rapid pass through ajax? I'd like to get from an url and set a div's innerHTML with the result
[20:16:16] <Cheaterman> div will have an id ^__^
[20:16:42] <Cheaterman> (calling a local API, but the server-side call is blocking... prety silly right... so let's do asynchronously from the client browser instead)
[20:18:29] <Cheaterman> oh well actually $.get(myurl, success: function(response) { document.getElementById('myDiv').innerHTML = response.data }); could suffice?
[20:18:45] <Cheaterman> (that was the line I was looking for, provided it works)
[20:25:41] <Cheaterman> Haha, for some reason it doesn't work :/
[20:25:45] <Cheaterman> I have NO idea why though
[20:25:58] <Cheaterman> My react controller doesn't fire when I fill my div with the above
[20:26:00] <Cheaterman> hmm div
[20:26:06] <Cheaterman> script inside div?
[20:26:37] <Cheaterman> nah that would be silly, i don't see why it would be an issue
[20:28:04] <Cheaterman> Hmm anyways it works with my horrible server-side synchronous cal
[20:28:06] <Cheaterman> call
[20:28:23] <Cheaterman> and the jquery call did work as well ^^
[20:28:27] <Cheaterman> not a problem on jquery side
[20:28:30] <Cheaterman> so i'll see you all later :)
[20:28:34] <Cheaterman> baiii o/
[21:05:36] <durdenk> I need to get inner html of a div and send it as it is via post, cant seem to do that.
[21:59:07] <aro> what would i need to do to trigger a click on any ajax created element under a certain node?
[22:04:46] <Whirled> Setup a listener on it's parent?
[22:05:50] <Whirled> or rather the first non-ajax created element in the parental heirarchy if possible.
[22:08:43] <lu_tze> any equivalence in jquery to perform the follow: https://jsfiddle.net/c13yc252/2/
[22:08:55] <lu_tze> I really don't want to add another libary just for D3.select.
[22:12:04] <Whirled> Not sure I get you lu_tze
[22:13:43] <lu_tze> Whirled: I'm building a svg with a xlink:href datauri
[22:15:02] <lu_tze> bunch of images as datauri base64 stored in a svg as a sort of "collage"
[22:16:28] <lu_tze> to rephrase, I would like to build the svg object with the following criteria in vanilla JS or jquery, if possible... I dont know.
[22:16:38] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/estelle/sjjjb/
[22:17:03] <Whirled> Would something like that help. I realize that's not exactly the same, but the syntax might be similar
[22:17:59] <Whirled> never mind that. She forgot the jquery part. LOL
[22:20:14] <lu_tze> I updated to give more insight: https://jsfiddle.net/c13yc252/3/
[22:20:46] <docmur> I have the following code: https://jsfiddle.net/b83Los2y/  but what I want to do, is to select the value displayed in the select boxes instead of all the options, how do I make this edit?
[22:24:55] <Whirled> docmur, you want to display the values in all of the select boxes? right now you are showing the entire text.
[22:26:15] <docmur> Right, I want the value being displayed in the select but NOT all the options
[22:37:44] <Whirled> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/b83Los2y/1/
[22:37:50] <Whirled> something like that?
[22:39:24] <docmur> yes :)
[22:39:25] <docmur> thanks!
[23:10:50] <aro> why would jquery bindings not be preserved if i use $(document.body).on('click', ''element.class', function() { });
[23:10:58] <aro> when i delete the element and recreate it?
