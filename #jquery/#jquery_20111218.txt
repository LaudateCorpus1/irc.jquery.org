[01:50:21] <MagePsycho> Hi Guys
[01:50:33] <MagePsycho> how to bind all form elements to get request
[01:50:41] <MagePsycho> using jQuery.get()
[01:58:58] <Zerpex> how can I define a var etc $className = $('.className'); doesn't work for me :S
[02:01:30] <astropirate> Zerpex, variable names can't have spaces in them
[02:02:02] <astropirate> http://eloquentjavascript.net/   its freeee!!! give it a read before you start hating javascript
[02:02:23] <astropirate> and its the best book in my opinion out there about JS
[02:02:54] <Zerpex> astropirate: what I can see there isn't a space in my variable if I do like: var $className = $('.className');
[02:03:34] <Mayank>  Hi, I have an address field with values like ->> "Foo foo <foo@address.com>, bar foo <foo@address.com>, foo bar <foobar@address.com>" or -->> foo@address.com, foo1@address.com, foo2@address.com, or --> foo foo <foo@address.com>, foo2@address.com". The user has an option to enter the address in anyway he wishes to like. I want to validate these email addresses at the first level for valid emal sytanx, and also i need extract the *only* the email address if i
[02:03:44] <Zauberfisch> Zerpex what exactly is not working?
[02:03:51] <astropirate> Zerpex, then the variable is defined, not sure what you mean it isnt' working
[02:04:06] <Zerpex> when I define the var, and use the variable name instead, my javascript isn't working anymore
[02:04:29] <astropirate> Zerpex, can you post the error?
[02:04:40] <astropirate> from the error console/firebug/chrome dev tool
[02:06:29] <Zerpex> This is my code that works: http://pastebin.com/a4B6F8Wr - When I use the var like this: http://pastebin.com/SYKT6K8M it doesn't work.. and console in chrome dev tool doesn't return anything :S
[02:11:42] <Zauberfisch> Zerpex you should not put $('.className'); outsite of $(document).ready(
[02:11:55] <Zauberfisch> move var $className = $('.className'); to line 6
[02:12:42] * Zerpex giving Zauberfisch high five!
[02:12:49] <Zauberfisch> yay
[02:12:55] <Zerpex> Thank you!! :Dl
[02:13:25] <Zauberfisch> Zerpex the problem was that you selected all .className before the document was ready, so there where none to select
[02:13:45] <Zerpex> that makes sense :P
[02:13:46] <Zauberfisch> this is also why there was no error, the code was fine, you just didn't got anything to use it on
[02:14:28] <Zerpex> I've always found javascript and jquery kinda weird, but.. starting to understand it now.. Much like PHP to be honest :P
[02:15:48] <Zerpex> is there any way I can optimize the code, for etc being faster? :O
[02:16:56] <Zogot> Dont think for speeds there much, but you can put stuff into objects if you wanna seperate the code a little better
[02:17:43] <Zogot> What I do with my code: http://jsfiddle.net/PNATv/
[02:19:01] <astropirate> Zerpex, noo!!!!! its nothing like php
[02:19:03] <astropirate> lol
[02:19:09] <astropirate> aside from syntax
[02:19:45] <astropirate> http://eloquentjavascript.net/   really read this, its a quick read :D
[02:19:56] <astropirate> good investement, if you areplanning on using javascript
[02:21:22] <Zerpex> astropirate: knowing PHP, makes me thinking javascript is easier.. Don't know :D
[02:21:36] <PK_> Hi folks -> got a really quick JQuery question. I have a <span class="pewpew"></span>  . I wish to add an img inside there. This is what i've got (but it's not working): $user.find('.note').add('<img src="http://asdfsdds.whatever.com'); Can anyone help? please?
[02:22:15] <astropirate> Zerpex, it being so easy is what makes people hate javascript. Its so easy people dont' bother learning it and they get burned. and then they hate the language
[02:22:45] <astropirate> its just so flexible its easy to mess up in
[02:23:01] <PK_> (oh, i forgot to end that string with  /> in my example above..)
[02:23:32] <Zerpex> astropirate: I've been doing frontend for long time, and I've never really learned javascript or just jquery.. I've been living fine without it.. but sometimes, when I see the use of javascript etc.. I'm getting so amazed, what it can do.. And that's why I wanna learn it, because it makes things easier :D
[02:24:17] <astropirate> Zerpex, yah I went though the same phase  did front end stuff for a bout 2 years before i bothered learning JavaScript :p
[02:26:33] <Mayank> Hi, I want to validate email address string in the "To:" address field of compose mail form. This should return true against ->> "Foo bar" <foo@foo.com>, foo bar <foobar@foo.com>, foo@foobar.com but should return false when something like this is entered - "foo foo", "foo <foo@foo.com" and similar. how can i do this?
[02:28:07] <PK_> Hi folks -> got a really quick JQuery question. I have a <span class="pewpew"></span>  . I wish to add an img inside there. This is what i've got (but it's not working): $user.find('.note').add('<img src="http://asdfsdds.whatever.com" />'); Can anyone help? please?
[02:28:44] <Zogot> .append
[02:28:59] <PK_> i use APPEND instead of .ADD ?
[02:29:13] <PK_> i thought append would result in <span></span><img .. /> ?
[02:30:48] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/uMkNt/2/
[02:31:49] <Zogot> Good :)?
[02:31:51] <PK_> @zogot - thanks heaps man
[02:31:53] <PK_> yeah
[02:31:57] <Zogot> no worries
[02:31:59] <PK_> that helps big time :)
[02:32:02] * PK_ bows low.
[02:36:46] <PK_> Oh @zogot -> is there a better way to use Append .. meaning .. instead of passing in a string (ie. '<img src="dfsdfdfsdf" />") .. is there a cleaner way using chaining? eg. .add("img").src(...) ... ???
[02:36:46] <Zauberfisch> Zogot you might want to take a look at https://github.com/hafriedlander/jquery.entwine
[02:38:05] <Zauberfisch> PK_ afaik the jquery create element way is $('<img/>')
[02:38:15] <Zauberfisch> which would be the same as using append in that ccase
[02:38:38] <Zauberfisch> var myImg = $('<img/>');
[02:39:05] <PK_> ok. (and i ment .append .. not .add after Zogot corrected me)
[02:39:06] <Zauberfisch> myImg.attr('src', '//foo.bar/1337.png');
[02:39:36] <Zauberfisch> $('.something').append(myImg);
[02:46:57] <inki> in jquery ui, is there a way to format form input fields so they are aligned?
[02:47:34] <inki> atm, i format them with class="text ui-widget-content ui-corner-all"
[02:47:34] <astropirate> inki, that all css, jquery has nothing to do with that
[02:47:43] <inki> hmm well
[02:47:57] <inki> it's standard part of jquery ui, isn't it
[02:48:46] <astropirate> what is o_O
[02:49:03] <astropirate> are you talking about the text alignement?
[02:49:10] <inki> well, not really
[02:49:38] <inki> i want to extend the input fields to reach th width of the surrounding container
[02:50:02] <astropirate> inki, yah, you'd just use css for that
[02:50:09] <astropirate> input { width: 100%; }
[02:50:20] <astropirate> you can ofcourse refine that css selector
[02:50:30] <inki> i thought jquery might have something builtin
[02:50:35] <astropirate> nope
[02:50:43] <astropirate> i highly doubt it
[02:50:48] <mathi> hi
[02:50:53] <astropirate> hello!
[02:51:09] <mathi> how can I have the size in bytes of a variable ?
[02:51:33] <astropirate> mathi, you don't
[02:51:33] <mathi> and the variable may be a string, array, object, ...
[02:51:39] <mathi> why?
[02:51:50] <astropirate> because there isn't a way to do so
[02:51:57] <astropirate> mathi, what do yo uwant to accomplish?
[02:52:18] <inki> astropirate: works like charm, thx
[02:52:26] <astropirate> inki, your welcome
[02:52:35] <mathi> I want to log size of variables that I put in my indexedDB, because the DB gets pretty big quickly
[02:52:56] <mathi> and I would like to know what is taking so much space
[02:53:47] <astropirate> mathi, afraid there isn't a way to do that, there is a stackoverflow on this
[02:53:51] <astropirate> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5254278/size-of-a-variable-in-javascript
[03:00:06] <igore> I'm trying to prepend and element to this selector:
[03:00:09] <igore> jQuery('#card-' + knode.ID).children('.card_children')
[03:00:45] <igore> the selector contains only one element, when I console.log
[03:01:01] <igore> however, when I prepend an element to it..
[03:01:16] <igore> it adds it to all divs with class .card_children
[03:01:30] <igore> not just children of the specific div with the ID
[03:01:46] <igore> I hope I'm not typing to myself here, but it seems like it is so.
[03:02:02] <astropirate> i'm reading it
[03:02:05] <ssj> me too
[03:02:24] <astropirate> "that shouldn't happen"
[03:02:27] <astropirate> "no shit"
[03:04:05] <astropirate> igore, i'm assuming this is inside of a for loop or something
[03:04:18] <astropirate> i bet your logic is broken somewhere there
[03:06:55] <igore> astropirate-> its not in a loop.
[03:07:24] <igore> i checked the .length just before .prepend and it returns 1
[03:08:54] <ravenzz> $('#card-' + knode.ID + ' .card_children')
[03:09:20] <astropirate> hmm but his statement should also work
[03:09:37] <ravenzz> yep
[03:09:37] <astropirate> igore, what about append?
[03:10:16] <igore> still the same problem
[03:10:34] <ravenzz> what is knode ?
[03:10:49] <igore> still adding to all instances of .card_children
[03:11:36] <igore> knode is an object with the data i'm using the populate the div.
[03:11:59] <igore> i'm using the ID in the id element so that its unique and that I can refer back to each records div
[03:12:22] <ravenzz> that make sense
[03:13:19] <ravenzz> i would be sure that it isn't an elements' selection
[03:13:29] <igore> however, something strange is going on in general i think.. i couldn't get .dialog elements to go to top when clicked on. But when I test on jsfiddle, it works..
[03:13:52] <ravenzz> can you provide us a live demo?
[03:14:20] <igore> sure, it might take me 5min to get it live
[03:15:01] <ravenzz> perfect, i'll smoke a sigaret ;)
[03:15:44] <astropirate> i'll keep working my world domination plans
[03:17:12] <ssj> world domination plans =-o
[03:17:23] <ssj> wat plans astropirate
[03:17:51] <astropirate> its quite ingenious, open up a coffee shop at every street corner in eveyr major city
[03:17:59] <astropirate> and wayyy overcharge the customers
[03:18:19] <astropirate> i'll name it star-something
[03:18:30] <astropirate> MUAHAHAH truely diabolical

[03:18:56] <astropirate> lol
[03:19:04] <ssj> no one's gonna drink coffee at that high price :P
[03:19:22] <ssj> i will open a cheap coffee shop next to it 8-)
[03:19:30] <astropirate> ohh no, thats where yo uare wrong, i'll market to mac hipsters
[03:19:42] <astropirate> the more expensive somethign is for them, the more they are whilling to pay for it :D
[03:19:47] <ssj> damn :(
[03:20:11] <mathi> is it possible to convert a javascript array to a string, and then convert this string back into an array ?
[03:20:44] <astropirate> mathi, yes array.join('delimeter')    string.split('delimeter');
[03:20:55] <ssj> then i will serve coffee in extremely small cups :D
[03:21:03] <mathi> thank you, gonna try that :)
[03:21:07] <astropirate> np
[03:21:09] <ssj> smaller things are expensive
[03:21:14] <astropirate> haha yes
[03:21:17] <astropirate> why didn't i think o fthat
[03:21:22] <igore> almost there..
[03:21:32] <igore> do I still have your attention?
[03:21:39] <astropirate> no, we are planning world domination
[03:22:08] <ssj> coz ur teacher didnt tell u about it astropirate ;)
[03:22:21] <astropirate> ssj, 'bout what?
[03:22:31] <ssj> small things :D

[04:25:24] <Narhir> Hey guys...
[04:25:27] <Narhir> I was just thinking
[04:25:40] <Narhir> coz Im working on "ecommerce clothing shop for my mother"
[04:25:42] <Narhir> -.-
[04:26:00] <Narhir> and... would that be possible to.... "create" page like "check how you would look on it
[04:26:03] <ssj> poor lil boy :(
[04:26:34] <Narhir> where.. person uploads their photo, and then can attach to the photo a "png cloth" and move it around photo resize it and so on ?
[04:26:39] <Narhir> or.. its impossible to be done
[04:27:13] <igore> is it a bad idea to use .dialog() for popup windows?
[04:27:41] <igore> with content a bit more complicated then what I think a dialog would be for, however, it works fine.
[04:31:23] <enerel> guys http://valuq.mn/contacts.php why the submit click function is not triggering?
[04:33:14] <Zauberfisch> enerel http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[04:33:21] <Zauberfisch> $(document).ready(handler)
[04:33:34] <Zauberfisch> where handler is your JS code
[04:33:46] <Zauberfisch> in an anonymus function
[04:34:08] <Zauberfisch> (at least .ready would be my first guess)
[04:34:18] <Zauberfisch> no wait
[04:34:32] <Zauberfisch> its bound
[04:34:35] <Zauberfisch> hmm
[04:35:25] <enerel> yeah
[04:35:32] <enerel> very strange
[04:36:31] <Zauberfisch> enerel at a closer look it seems to work for me
[04:36:45] <Zauberfisch> at least it adds the class hightlight on validation error
[04:36:46] <enerel> nothing works for me
[04:37:00] <enerel> i use FF
[04:37:04] <Zauberfisch> but the .hightlight css style is not working since its overruled
[04:37:23] <Zauberfisch> enerel in your css, change:
[04:37:27] <Zauberfisch> .element .hightlight
[04:37:27] <Zauberfisch> to
[04:37:33] <Zauberfisch> .element input.hightlight
[04:37:40] <Zauberfisch> ,
[04:37:46] <Zauberfisch> .element textarea.hightlight
[04:38:09] <enerel> or just .hightlight
[04:38:47] <Zauberfisch> enerel no, just  .hightlight is over written by .element input.text
[04:38:54] <Zauberfisch> since .element input.text is more specific
[04:38:57] <enerel> ok
[04:39:02] <Zauberfisch> so it overrules it
[04:41:38] <enerel> it work now
[05:09:59] <frazras> i cannot seem to use the getJSON function on any of the JSON feeds i can find, can anyone test this and tell me what im doing wrong
[05:10:01] <frazras> var jqxhr = $.getJSON("http://demos.9lessons.info/data.json", function() {alert("success");})
[05:10:01] <frazras> 		.success(function() { alert("second success");})
[05:10:02] <frazras> 		.error(function(data) {console.log(data); })
[05:24:43] <Caelum> what is the difference between deferred.always() and deferred.then()
[05:25:42] <Caelum> never mind, stupid question
[05:32:26] <Mayank> Hi, what will be the selector for a <li> element containing a particular HTML? xpath?
[05:34:28] <frazras> I found the answer after days of searching - getJSON NEEDS a jsonp feed, which NEEDS to have the ?callback=? appended to the URL, just incase you ever need to use it
[05:35:21] <Mayank> is $("//span[contains(., 'something')]").someFunc valid in jQuery?
[05:36:00] <dw> frazras: getJSON only needs jsonp when doing cross domain
[05:37:47] <frazras> dw:  OK cool, nothing was working for me since Friday, right now I am just happy, back to doing actual work
[05:44:40] <tomasm-> hi, i'm using sortable and want to have an event fire once i start dragging an item... i see the 'start' event, but i'm wondering how do I get the item being sorted?
[06:10:11] * IvanKuzev eats fiddles...and is hungry
[06:10:32] <dr0id> ehm
[06:10:43] <dr0id> WHERE'S THE FUN ? :O
[06:17:10] <IvanKuzev> hey guys...i will soon have to change my irc client...what do you use?
[06:18:24] <dr0id> iSup
[06:20:31] <asdlasda> hello
[06:20:51] <IvanKuzev> hi
[06:20:57] <asdlasda> i have a menu, with sub menus
[06:21:04] <asdlasda> structure:
[06:21:12] <asdlasda> <div class="menu">
[06:21:22] <asdlasda> there is 4 sub menus with display none
[06:21:32] <IvanKuzev> ?demo @ asdlasda
[06:21:39] <kggle> hey guys, any idea how to realize a nav like this: http://d.pr/65ol ?
[06:21:59] <kggle> asdlasda, what do you want to reach?
[06:22:05] <asdlasda> second
[06:22:06] <asdlasda> http://livetrance.net/devent/org/
[06:22:07] <IvanKuzev> asdlasda : it will be good if you give a sample code in jsfiddle.net
[06:22:08] <asdlasda> there is demo
[06:22:27] <asdlasda> i've use the hover function
[06:22:36] <asdlasda> and when i do it fast, something gonna wrong
[06:22:51] <asdlasda> shows all sub menus
[06:25:37] <kggle> asdlasda, maybe theres just a css mistake, try to use somehting like div.menu > ul >li:hover > ul{ display: block}
[06:25:47] <kggle> but as mentioned by IvanKuzev show us a demo!
[06:28:57] <tomasm-> I have a sortable that looks like this: <div id="Photos"><div class="Photo"><a href="/img/5"><img src="/img/small/5"/></a></div></div> .... but when I sort the photos, I get the placeholder, but the img doesnt move horizontally (only vertically), until I mouseup. any idea why? I dont see any obvious css issues
[06:30:32] <kggle> tomasm-, example? jsfiddle?
[06:32:03] <tomasm-> nevermind, i had an axis set, was only moving in one direction anyway =(
[06:49:43] <kaine> Hi, have someone a idea why after i fill up a dialog with ajax content on chrome the stylesheets are not applyed and the images not shown?
[06:52:32] <Hopsy> why can't I detect any scrollevent when I dont have any scrollbars http://jsfiddle.net/wXstz/1/
[06:53:46] <Woet> "The scroll event is sent to an element when the user scrolls to a different place in the element."
[06:54:25] <IvanKuzev> well....why shoud you?
[06:55:12] <Hopsy> Woet: how can I send it now
[06:55:29] <Woet> Hopsy: i'm not sure whether you can detect scroll up/down without having something to scroll
[06:55:45] <Woet> IvanKuzev: for an image gallery for example i guess, but it's very poor navigation
[06:55:57] <Hopsy> Woet: I am trying to make a horizontal slider
[06:56:08] <Woet> Hopsy: without a scrollbar?
[06:56:36] <Hopsy> Woet: I have only the scrollbar at the bottom
[06:56:50] <Woet> ?demo @ Hopsy
[06:56:50] <bot-t> Hopsy, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[06:57:48] <Hopsy> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/wXstz/3/
[06:57:59] <Hopsy> I want to see the bbb's when I scroll
[06:58:03] <EMKO> on my local dev pc i have localhost/sitename and on the web its just sitename.com how do i post with jquery that will work on both?
[06:58:15] <Woet> Hopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/wXstz/4/
[06:58:30] <Woet> Hopsy: if you don't show what you are actually trying to do, you won't get proper help
[06:58:42] <Woet> Hopsy: unless your site will be a red square with bbb's in them.
[06:58:53] <kggle> :)
[06:59:37] <Hopsy> Woet: there is not much to see -.-'
[06:59:44] <Hopsy> it's the same example
[06:59:58] <kggle> Hopsy, i really think you need this plugin: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/mousewheel
[07:00:12] <kggle> to register when a scroll happens with the wheel
[07:00:35] <Hopsy> right, that was that i need
[07:00:40] <Hopsy> thanks kggle
[07:00:44] <kggle> Hopsy, np
[07:01:14] <kggle> Hopsy, maybe have a look at this, too: http://twigstechtips.blogspot.com/2010/08/jquery-ui-slider-with-mouse-scrolling.html
[07:01:59] <Woet> kggle: and now he's probably abusing it for something that has a way better solution, cause he never told us what he's actually trying to do
[07:02:02] <Woet> but meh, not my problem
[07:02:55] <Hopsy> no Woet
[07:03:18] <Hopsy> like I said, its a horizontal slider
[07:03:26] <Woet> yes, i know you said what it is
[07:03:42] <Woet> and you still haven't said what you are trying to do

[07:38:50] <Ring0`> Hi. There I'm executing lot of php queries which takes a bit of time, after that all content is inserted into div. How can I use jquery to detect when the loading is done and use some cool preloader?
[07:39:00] <astropirate> MindSpark, mayybe the selector isn't finding anything
[07:39:37] <MindSpark> astropirate, the load function executes fine and the page loads in a div using ajax, just the complete function does not run, i.e. nothing is alerted or logged

[09:02:07] <peterschmidler> Hey everybody, I'm working on the launch script of www.plupload.com. I used the provided example file and it uses: function $(id) {return document.getElementById(id);};  thats why I run the script inside a function. Now I am not able to address divs from inside the function. Does anybody have any idea how to solve this? Here's the script: https://gist.github.com/1493915
[09:04:57] <peterschmidler> Is there a way to "disable" or "reverse" this for one call? $(id) {return document.getElementById(id);};

[09:10:41] <dabear> peterschmidler: man, we heared ya the first two times
[09:11:26] <Dr4g> hey jquery'ers
[09:11:48] <dabear> peterschmidler: do var $jq = jQuery; and then use $jq("#show")
[09:12:01] <dabear> Dr4g: hey
[09:12:11] <Dr4g> dabear: or jQuery("#show")
[09:12:39] <peterschmidler> dabear: Thanks, I thought my first try might have been unclear.
[09:13:09] <peterschmidler> dabear: and it worked ;)
[09:13:16] <peterschmidler> Dr4g: Thanks
[09:13:54] <Dr4g> peterschmidler: google more about "jquery selectors"

[10:09:11] <sanova> http://paste.debian.net/149551/
[10:09:46] <sanova> but it seems $.ajax not run!

[10:15:18] <MoTiOnXml> any need to use === for booleans and numbers?
[10:15:40] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, if i'm comparing length from a jQuery object?
[10:15:53] <MoTiOnXml> like $("div").length === 0?
[10:17:42] <RLa> MoTiOnXml, use === when you expect no type conversion
[10:18:42] <RLa> i.e both sides of === are either integers, booleans, or strings but not mixed
[10:21:12] <MoTiOnXml> RLa: i am using === to check for undefined etc.

[10:33:40] <felipe_Brz> how can I make a button with an icon and with some text using jquery UI?
[10:37:21] <felipe_Brz> nevermind I found it
[10:39:50] <felipe_Brz> but is it possible to use other icons than those offered in the framework? icons with transparent background so the buttons can still have the theme colours
[10:42:19] <denysonique> I am trying to scrap an iframe, but the iframe detects that I have an antibuster and when I antibust it refuses to show anything. Is it possible to disable script execution from the iframe?
[10:42:32] <denysonique> I tried $('iframe').contents().find('script').remove()
[10:42:38] <denysonique> but I guess it is two slow or somethig
[10:42:48] <denysonique> I even tried it with setInterval 1ms
[10:43:01] <denysonique> I have full access to the Iframe
[10:43:17] <denysonique> as I am running my browser with disabled cross origin protection
[10:46:35] <Jonno_FTW> how do I do a jquery function on all instances of a #someelement?
[10:46:58] <eatnumber1> Hey guys, I wrote some code that extends the Number class with a toWords function which converts the number into the english equivalent. Seeing as this is a non-trivial thing to do, do you have any suggestions on places I could submit this code to so that it might be useful to more than just myself?
[10:47:34] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW, you don't have more than one instance of an element with a given id
[10:47:44] <ajpiano> id's are required to be unique
[10:47:48] <Jonno_FTW> ok
[10:48:29] <denysonique> wow
[10:49:01] <denysonique> actually after clearing cache and with that hardcore setInterval iframe.contents()...remove('script') it worked (;
[10:49:10] <ajpiano> eatnumber1: set up a github repo?
[10:49:42] <RLa> uh oh, one cannot use $ in wordpress
[10:49:54] <eatnumber1> ajpiano: do you think it's the kind of thing jquery might want as an extension or something?
[10:49:58] <RLa> all my scripts are useless now
[10:50:30] <ajpiano> RLa: lol
[10:50:44] <RLa> http://elementdesignllc.com/2009/08/wordpress-jquery-is-not-a-function/
[10:50:57] <ajpiano> RLa: you can either use jQuery or wrap your code in (function($) { /* your code */)(jQuery)
[10:51:09] <ajpiano> wordpress calls $.noConflict by default
[10:51:22] <RLa> why should i do that? i think i have no prototype scripts?
[10:51:29] <ajpiano> eatnumber1: jquery has a plugins ecosystem, we don't take extensions like that into core unless they're super necessary
[10:51:57] <ajpiano> what you're doing sounds useful but doesn't need to be part of "jQuery," if that's what you're asking
[10:52:07] <PseudoNim> how can i submit a form from a jquery dialog but NOT redirect anywhere? basically, i want to trap the submit, and call $('.ui-dialog').dialog('close') to close the form. i tried adding onSubmit="return false;" to the form (and calling $('#form').submit() from a button), that didn't work
[10:52:26] <PseudoNim> a redirect to the ACTION="xxx.php" still happens :\
[10:52:37] <ajpiano> PseudoNim: the $("#theForm").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[10:53:12] <PseudoNim> ajpiano: interesting... one sec
[10:54:32] <PseudoNim> ajpiano: hm... the submit doesn't seem to happen now at all
[10:54:48] <ajpiano> that alone doesn't make it happen
[10:55:00] <ajpiano> that means that when the form is in fact submitted, it will not take the default action
[10:55:08] <ajpiano> but it doesn't trigger the submit at all
[10:55:22] <PseudoNim> oh ... i threw that into the button that calls the submit, oops.
[10:55:28] <PseudoNim> hehe
[10:55:45] <PseudoNim> so i should call the actual .post() there, right
[10:55:52] <ajpiano> ostensibly
[10:56:35] <Jonno_FTW> I am using this datepicker, but I can't figure out how to make .date elements all be datepickers, because more .date can be added to the page after loading
[10:56:37] <frenocha> i'm going from MySQL+XML to pure MySQL, o woe is me
[10:56:39] <Jonno_FTW> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/
[10:56:41] <PseudoNim> ajpiano: thanks :)
[10:57:01] <skione_> I am getting this error: has no method 'datepicker', I thought this was a standard function in jquery
[10:57:17] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: http://enterprisejquery.com/2010/07/configuring-ui-widgets-and-interactions-with-live/
[10:57:19] <skione_> oops nvm
[10:57:24] <zulax> is it possible to position alert box?
[10:57:29] <ajpiano> zulax: no
[10:57:45] <Jonno_FTW> ajpiano: thanks
[10:58:13] <zulax> ajpiano, other than dialog is there a jquery way of doing alert? (smthg as easy as dialog("html") ) ?
[10:58:20] <ajpiano> nope
[10:58:23] <ajpiano> i mean
[10:58:30] <zulax> thanks
[10:58:30] <ajpiano> yes, you can write a function that does what the dialog does
[10:58:32] <ajpiano> but crappier
[10:58:39] <ajpiano> but there's nothing in core that does it
[10:59:01] <zulax> ok, i will work on it when i get time, thanks ajpiano
[11:06:14] <Jonno_FTW> ajpiano: it didn't work the datepicker isn't being made for the new .date elements
[11:06:22] <abyss_> Hi
[11:07:29] <abyss_> I'm new to jQuery. I'm trying to call domready from the body of my page. Could this be done ?
[11:09:36] <systemfault> There is not spoon^Wdomready
[11:09:41] <systemfault> *no :/
[11:10:48] <abyss_> systemfault: I can execute events onClick but not I need them when the page loads
[11:11:37] <systemfault> Then do them on click?
[11:11:46] <systemfault> Not sure I get the question to be honest.
[11:11:55] <gloomer> $(document).ready(function () {});
[11:12:04] <ajpiano> abyss_: $(document).ready(function() { }); at the bottom of your body should work just fine
[11:12:04] <abyss_> gloomer: exactly
[11:12:14] <abyss_> But I'm using PHP
[11:12:17] <ajpiano> if it isn't, then you are probably doing something else wrong
[11:12:37] <abyss_> I tried echo "$(document).ready(function() { });" but I ended up with that printed on the top of my html
[11:12:51] <systemfault> abyss_: <script> tag?
[11:12:58] <Decoy_> You'll be wanting that in <script> tags
[11:13:16] <Decoy_> Or as part of a .js file
[11:13:28] <abyss_> Decoy_, systemfault yep
[11:13:31] <gloomer> ya you just echo'd a string i would think
[11:13:44] <abyss_> I added the tags
[11:13:52] <abyss_> But it printed the tags also :P
[11:13:54] <gloomer> did you src jquery library
[11:13:57] <abyss_> Outside <head>
[11:13:57] <Decoy_>  $(document).ready(function() {  /* stuff in here will be run at doc. ready time */  });
[11:13:58] <abyss_> Yes
[11:14:08] <gloomer> just post your code
[11:15:08] <abyss_> echo "<script language=javascript>(function($){ $(document).ready(function(){ $.jGrowl('Hello world!'); }); });</script>";
[11:15:35] <RLa> abyss_, that code does nothing?
[11:15:55] <abyss_> RLa: I prints <script...></script> on the top of my html
[11:16:04] <abyss_> as plaintext
[11:16:07] <RLa> you have function but you never call it
[11:16:15] <systemfault> Perhaps you're send the page as plain text :P
[11:16:16] <ajpiano> abyss_: you shouldn't be echoing it out from inside of a php block, it should not be in a php block to begin with
[11:16:19] <systemfault> *sending
[11:17:01] <abyss_> ajpiano: should I close php before that ?
[11:17:08] <ajpiano> probably.
[11:17:24] * gf3 clicks the red X in the top right of PHP
[11:17:33] <Decoy_> What happens if you close php ?> and just have the tag ( no echo, no quotes )
[11:17:46] <abyss_> Decoy_: let me try
[11:17:51] <Decoy_> :)
[11:18:13] <gf3> abyss_, Decoy_: in all seriousness though, it can be better NOT to close PHP
[11:18:34] <gf3> because this will prevent you from inadvertently sending unwanted content
[11:18:37] <zelrik> hi
[11:19:09] <gf3> jussayin'
[11:19:30] <Decoy_> Haha currently we are indvertantly sending unwanted plaintext
[11:19:40] <abyss_>  <script language=javascript>(function($){ $(document).ready(function(){ $.jGrowl('Hello world!'); }); });</script> 			  	<!DOCTYPE html>
[11:19:55] <abyss_> That's the beggining of the html output
[11:20:01] <zelrik> so, is there a way to make a sortable table with the title row not scrollable?
[11:21:01] <abyss_> Decoy_: that's the output even if I close php before
[11:21:02] <Decoy_> Right looks like you're sending your script before you even declasre doctype, how about if the script tage is perhaps just abouve the </body?
[11:21:04] <Decoy_> Right looks like you're sending your script before you even declasre doctype, how about if the script tage is perhaps just abouve the </body>
[11:21:24] <abyss_> Decoy_: I'm using Wordpress
[11:21:38] <abyss_> I don't have much control on <head>
[11:21:53] <abyss_> Or I could have it, but this event happens specifically on one page
[11:21:56] <Decoy_> Hmmm ok don't you have like a footer.php or similar in wp?
[11:22:23] <abyss_> Decoy_: yeap, but the event happens on one page
[11:22:36] <abyss_> I'm trying to notify the user that the avatar was changed succesfully
[11:25:36] <Decoy_> Ah right ok, thinking aloud, isn't there some kind of nice thing in wordpress where you can detect which page the user is on? <?php //pseudocode php if( page == 1 ) ?> <script...> <?php endif ?>
[11:25:52] <denysonique> eh
[11:25:54] <denysonique> php :/
[11:26:07] <systemfault> Heh... php.. :/
[11:26:16] <Decoy_> I'm probably not the right guy to help with that, seems more like a wordpress / php issue
[11:26:26] <denysonique> I am wondering when people will unlearn PHP
[11:26:47] <denysonique> Decoy_: you can detect in PHP
[11:27:25] <denysonique> Decoy_: $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]
[11:27:40] <systemfault> denysonique: Not going to happen... php spreads like cancer creating a legion of moron programmers.
[11:27:45] <RLa> abyss_, if you are using html5 doctype, you do not need language attribute
[11:27:48] <Decoy_> haha, we're really talking about wordpress 'pages'
[11:27:57] <Decoy_> and this probly isn't that place for that
[11:28:39] <denysonique> systemfault: I hope server side JS could rescue those people
[11:28:50] <RLa> huh, server-side js
[11:28:51] <denysonique> with learning JS they could hit two birds with one stone
[11:28:55] <denysonique> front-end/backend
[11:29:02] <denysonique> RLa: yes, nodejs, express etc
[11:29:13] <denysonique> nodejs is very high preformant
[11:29:20] <denysonique> and easier than php I would say
[11:29:21] <systemfault> denysonique: While I don't think that JS is the answer, I do think that javascript is cleaner than php
[11:29:24] <Decoy_> Well sure but best of luck with finding a wordpress that'll work with node
[11:29:27] <denysonique> as JS is a proper language unlike JS
[11:29:46] <denysonique> wordpress is cancer too
[11:29:46] <abjorn> "as JS is a proper language unlike JS"
[11:29:52] <denysonique> unlike PHP*
[11:29:57] <RLa> wordpress sucks
[11:30:12] <Decoy_> js != js, that sounds like js to me
[11:30:32] <RLa> expecially those millions of broken plugins
[11:30:41] <RLa> and creating templates for it sucks
[11:34:53] <denysonique> RLa: creating templates for JS sucks?
[11:34:59] <denysonique> what do you mean?
[11:35:03] <systemfault> He said for WP, no?
[11:35:15] <denysonique> then I agree
[11:35:35] <denysonique> I guess that most of you still write HTML
[11:35:50] <denysonique> writing HTML is inefficient
[11:35:59] <denysonique> there is something cooler than writing HTML in HTML
[11:36:07] <systemfault> What? :/
[11:36:11] <systemfault> No problem with html
[11:36:12] <denysonique> something that makes you more productive
[11:36:23] <denysonique> anyone knows what I am talking about?
[11:36:38] <systemfault> It's easy... efficient even if it's a little verbose and describe a document well.
[11:36:50] <RLa> "I guess that most of you still write HTML" <- not in wordpress
[11:36:58] <denysonique> systemfault: http://haml-lang.com
[11:37:11] <RLa> you write some weird mixup of html and php
[11:37:51] <systemfault> denysonique: I know about haml..
[11:37:59] <aerospa> zen coding is pretty cool too
[11:38:35] <denysonique> https://github.com/dxw/wp-haml#readme this is haml for WP btw
[11:38:40] <denysonique> also
[11:38:55] <denysonique> I often write JS in something more productive than JS
[11:39:00] <denysonique> CoffeeScript
[11:39:26] <abyss_> If I call the domready function from an a onclick it works
[11:39:38] <abyss_> But I'm not able to call it without an event happening
[11:39:53] <Decoy_> I once found a line that had html, css, php, javascript and some mysql in it. A fine blend of logic, presentation, behaviour, model and view all in one unmaintainable clusterfuck
[11:39:57] <systemfault> denysonique: I was looking at the haml page... it's not that good.
[11:40:19] <systemfault> denysonique: And as verbose if you write good html... (Not just a pack of divs)
[11:40:25] <RLa> Decoy_, only a single line? i have found projects with tens thousands of such?
[11:40:38] <Real-ity> Good afternoon!  I'm trying to build a rather simple selector to find any elements with a custom attribute within a jQuery object  (originally created from a form field, I doubt that makes a difference).  <div custom:attr="test">   object.find("custom\\:attr]")   won't return anything, it seems to be an issue with the colon.  Any ideas? :)
[11:40:42] <Decoy_> Ugh
[11:40:49] <RLa> 10k lines of total mess and no documentation
[11:40:55] <ajpiano> ?escaping @ Real-ity
[11:40:55] <systemfault> Decoy_: That's surprisingly common...
[11:40:55] <bot-t> Real-ity, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[11:41:00] <Decoy_> Burn it and through computer out the window
[11:41:09] <denysonique> systemfault: nope, haml renders exactly to html. and without closing tags you are looking at at least %50 decrease of tags
[11:41:16] <ajpiano> Real-ity: if you have 'custom attributes' you want to express in html, use data- attributes....
[11:41:40] <systemfault> denysonique: Wow... but you need to compile it... makes the feedback loop longer.. etc...
[11:41:45] <Real-ity> ajpiano: I totally would, except the content I'm pulling in isn't something I made :(
[11:41:51] <systemfault> denysonique: Overall, I think they're probably equal.
[11:41:53] <RLa> i like wicket templates, pure xhtml
[11:42:11] <systemfault> denysonique: With a different set of advantages... and disadvantages.
[11:42:22] <denysonique__> systemfault: what are the disadvantages of Haml?
[11:42:24] <denysonique__> none.
[11:42:32] <systemfault> denysonique__: Not native.
[11:42:36] <RLa> haml requires conversion step
[11:42:37] <systemfault> denysonique__: Must be compiled.
[11:42:49] <RLa> and increases complexity
[11:43:02] <denysonique__> yes, I would call that translation, which is performed automatically by my text editor
[11:43:03] <systemfault> Also, I'm not a fan of languages dependant on indentation.
[11:43:14] <systemfault> But that's damn subjective...
[11:43:47] <systemfault> RLa: I wish xhtml would die.
[11:43:52] <Decoy_> Don't use ut
[11:43:52] <denysonique__> the complexity is only in the xml way of html, which requires closing tags etc, which often is a problem, with Haml you can clearly see the indentations
[11:43:54] <Decoy_> Don't use it
[11:44:11] <RLa> systemfault, good luck with namespaces in html5
[11:44:21] <denysonique__> you probably have nerver written much in Haml. When trying a new technology you just don't have a look at it, you at least write one project using it
[11:44:29] <systemfault> RLa: Why do I need them? ;)
[11:44:39] <denysonique__> brb
[11:44:44] <systemfault> RLa: I've written tons of layouts with a need for them.
[11:44:53] <RLa> systemfault, you can use namespace for templating effectively
[11:45:26] <systemfault> RLa: Do you know a single website serving their xhtml as... xhtml?
[11:45:33] <systemfault> I don't know any.
[11:45:51] <RLa> i.e something like: <f:loop items="stuff"><li>item</li></f:loop>
[11:46:07] <Real-ity> ajpiano: even with my escaping I'm running into no luck.  It seems for everyone escaping solves it, so I'm not sure what I'm missing.  Example:  http://f.gabe.bz/0d2V0K1u1s2D2z2e3x0z
[11:46:09] <systemfault> I usually use server-side templating languages
[11:46:13] <RLa> systemfault, it's value is in ide support
[11:46:36] <RLa> systemfault, it is server side, jsp uses similar tags
[11:46:51] <RLa> and there are powerful xml editors
[11:47:37] <systemfault> RLa: It's just that I personally think that it's because of the w3c fixation on xml that we needed something like the whatwg to actually improve the web.
[11:48:02] <ajpiano> Real-ity: there may be bugs with handling like, what amounts to "xml namespaces" in your html
[11:48:08] <RLa> systemfault, example from wicket: http://wicket.apache.org/learn/examples/helloworld.html
[11:48:11] <systemfault> xhtml doesn't really add much value.
[11:48:15] <RLa> scroll down to HelloWorld.html
[11:48:24] <Jonno_FTW> I have this, but when I add new elements, they don't get new datepickers when clicked http://pastebin.ws/bibqgm
[11:48:48] <systemfault> RLa: Looks clean
[11:48:59] <RLa> you cannot use something:name attributes without namespaces support
[11:49:05] <mightym> did some encounter the problem when appending  <li> to <ul>  that the li is appended but at the end of the body but not inside the ul?
[11:49:36] <systemfault> mightym: Must be a bug in your code :/
[11:49:40] <RLa> but if you have such support you can use ide autocompletion for them
[11:49:49] <Real-ity> RLa, ajpiano: ah perfect.  Where would I read up on how to add this namespace support?  I'm pulling in this markup remotely, but I can append to it in order to make the selector work.
[11:50:02] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: "hasDatepicker" should have a period in front of it... and also... you are never *adding* the class hasDatepicker to begin with
[11:50:12] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: read the article thoroughly, don't just skim it and copy and paste
[11:50:16] <RLa> Real-ity, only xml and xhtml support namespaces
[11:50:19] <Jonno_FTW> I did read it
[11:50:32] <ajpiano> do it again!
[11:50:50] <ajpiano> Real-ity: where is this markup even coming from, it's so... flawed
[11:51:22] <ajpiano> Real-ity: you might want to look into see ?parseXML
[11:51:22] <bot-t> Real-ity, jQuery.parseXML(data): Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[11:51:31] <Real-ity> ajpiano: it's a mailchimp template that is html with these custom attributes.  I'm trying to pull out all the editable areas.
[11:51:43] <Real-ity> ajpiano: ah ha, that may be my answer!  thank you!
[11:55:35] <Ring0`> Hi. Did the jQuery Translate stopped working? I saw 2 sites (not only mine) where it used to work, in all browsers.
[11:55:41] <Ring0`> stop*
[11:57:19] <Ring0`> Ah yes. Sorry
[11:57:21] <Ring0`> it is..
[11:57:28] <ajpiano> * Since the free Google Translate API has been discontinued on December 1, 2011 this plugin will use the Microsoft Translator service: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff512404.aspx Unfortunately there are issues with it: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/microsofttranslator/thread/775fd592-9d40-4ca5-85a4-32ac39967c98
[11:58:24] <Jonno_FTW> ajpiano: I read it carefully and fixed my code and it still doesn't work
[11:59:02] <ajpiano> put together a live demo on jsfiddle or i can't really help at all
[12:00:23] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: just so you know, pointing someone to an article on "general approach to a prolem" doesn't make the linker of said article responseible for helping implement said technique ;)
[12:01:43] <Jonno_FTW> I know
[12:03:41] <Jonno_FTW> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/AMgEE/ is what I have now
[12:05:02] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: creating duplicate ids is a less than desirable outcome
[12:06:05] <Jonno_FTW> what should I do instead?
[12:06:20] <ajpiano> change the ID, use a template string, etc
[12:06:27] <ajpiano> crate a brand new element on the fly etc etc
[12:07:00] <Jonno_FTW> is that the reason for the new datepicker not appearing though?
[12:07:54] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: given that you haven't included jquery ui in this fiddle to begin with, it's pretty hard to say
[12:08:51] <Jonno_FTW> how do I do that?
[12:09:19] <Jonno_FTW> nvm
[12:10:08] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: this appears tow ork http://jsfiddle.net/AMgEE/2/
[12:11:18] <ajpiano> loljk
[12:11:32] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: lol,
[12:11:38] <Jonno_FTW> yep
[12:11:41] <ajpiano> part of the problem is that you are cloning instead of creating new elements
[12:12:00] <ajpiano> so you end up with the datepicker class already aplied, etc
[12:12:02] <Jonno_FTW> what should I do then?
[12:13:01] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/AMgEE/3/
[12:15:18] <Jonno_FTW> ajpiano: but the real form is much longer than that
[12:15:26] <ajpiano> use a template
[12:15:51] <Jonno_FTW> can I just store the form as a string before the user has a chance to enter anything?
[12:15:57] <ajpiano> or any one of a million different approaches to creating new elemetns that don't involve cloning elements that are already in the dom
[12:15:59] <ajpiano> Jonno_FTW: yes
[12:16:11] <Jonno_FTW> how do I do this?
[12:16:16] <ajpiano> but you want to do that before you create any datepickers...
[12:16:36] <Jonno_FTW> of course, I'll put it at the top of the .ready fucntion
[12:16:36] <ajpiano> ?html()
[12:16:37] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:17:25] <Jonno_FTW> so $('.event').html() ?
[12:17:38] <ajpiano> something like that
[12:17:41] <ajpiano> but i really wouldn't do it that way
[12:17:47] <Jonno_FTW> why?
[12:18:02] <ajpiano> because i'd use a proper template, and then template in the first one as well
[12:18:24] <ajpiano> instead of like "oh nerp nerp hey look i got some static html now i'll consume it and use it in a template-like way"
[12:20:08] <Jonno_FTW> ok how do i make templates?
[12:21:29] <ajpiano> http://ashishware.com/JSTemplates.shtml
[12:21:43] <Jonno_FTW> cheers
[12:22:03] <ajpiano> there are a number of popular templating libraries, handlebars, underscore, mustache, ejs,
[12:22:05] <ajpiano> the list goes on and on
[12:24:22] <Neil> Would you expect this to push a new key/value pair in to an existing "content" value nested in a "message" array? data.push({"message": { name:'content', value: "1234" } });
[12:26:03] <ajpiano> perhaps
[12:26:09] <ajpiano> it depends on what the daata structure looks like
[12:26:53] <aaairc> if i needed to figure out what neighborhood a specific address lies within... does anyone know of an online service that can do that... that is free?
[12:26:57] <wathek> Hi everybody
[12:27:00] <wathek> I got a question
[12:27:04] <aaairc> Can you do that with Google Maps for example
[12:27:21] <wathek> is it possible to do this : $('#parrain').trigger('blur') == true
[12:27:24] <aaairc> I'm specifically interested for the city of LA, and neighborhoods like Silver Lake, Echo Park, Hollywood, etc
[12:27:25] <aaairc> thanks
[12:27:56] <wathek> I want to get what's returned by the blur event's function
[12:28:09] <ajpiano> wathek: .trigger("foo") doesn't return that
[12:28:14] <Neil> ajpiano: I'm trying to update like so { "message": { "content" : "1234" }}
[12:28:28] <ajpiano> Neil: there are no arrays there
[12:28:30] <wathek> ajpiano, is there a way to get what's returned ?
[12:28:38] <wathek> without having to create a function ?
[12:28:45] <wathek> I mean an independant function
[12:29:05] <Neil> ajpiano: How would you expect to update the "content" value nested within the "message" using push?
[12:29:18] <Neil> ...or some other method?
[12:29:21] <ajpiano> Neil: i wouldn't use an array method to manipulate an object.
[12:29:45] <ajpiano> foo.message.content = "bar";
[12:29:56] <Neil> ajpiano: Ok. I have a "data" object like so: data = $form.serializeArray();
[12:30:17] <ajpiano> uch the format of serializeArray is so useless
[12:30:37] <ajpiano> cause you can't index into the array by the name of the field, you can only loop
[12:30:58] <ajpiano> why are you using serializeArray
[12:31:24] <ajpiano> wathek: not in core
[12:32:10] <Neil> ajpiano: I didn't write it. I'm just trying to update the "content" value within the data variable.
[12:32:21] <wathek> ajpiano, ok thank you
[12:32:32] <Neil> ajpiano: Is that possible?
[12:33:04] <ajpiano> Neil: you have to loop over the array of objects, figure out when you're on the one whose name property is 'content', and then update it
[12:33:20] <Neil> ajpiano: Thanks
[12:33:39] <ajpiano> $.each( foo, function(index, obj) { if (obj.name == 'conent') {  obj.value='whatever'; }   });
[12:35:06] <ajpiano> Neil: you might want to consider whether it's easier to just manipulate the value in the form before serializeArray is called
[12:35:23] <Neil> ajpiano: Yes I was thinking that. How would I do it?
[12:36:11] <ajpiano> $("someformelement").val(function(i, val) {return val + "foo");  })
[12:36:22] <Neil> ajpiano: http://pastie.org/private/wvfupcm99pcfzxltamj3w
[12:37:06] <aaairc> has anyone in here used Yahoo PlaceFinder?
[12:37:32] <ajpiano> Neil: basically, by changing the value of the input before you serialize the form
[12:37:48] <ajpiano> ?val(...)
[12:37:48] <bot-t> .val(value): Set the value of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/#val2
[12:37:52] <rio{> If I am making a "jquery plugin" that actually cant be attached to any other element than document and never have more than one instance, is there any sort of best practice for that since I find the normal jQuery plugin guidelines not so fitted for this
[12:39:56] <ajpiano> rio{: sounds like you should just be writing a singleton that conforms to your requirements
[12:40:21] <ajpiano> getting ahold of $(document) doesn't require you to write a plugin
[12:41:28] <Neil> ajpiano: If I update the input value on the submit event will the form submission still receive the updated value?
[12:41:33] <Jonno_FTW> hooray it finally works
[12:41:39] <Jonno_FTW> thanks for your ajpiano
[12:41:44] <Jonno_FTW> *your help
[12:41:53] <ajpiano> you can have the whole ajpiano
[12:41:56] <ajpiano> Neil: yep
[12:42:13] <Neil> ajpiano: Just checked my logs - yes it's working. Thank you.
[12:42:14] <Jonno_FTW> now I just need to go through the forms and put them into a json I can send to the php
[12:42:21] <Jonno_FTW> how should I go about this/
[12:43:29] <rio{> ajpiano ye I dont need a plugin, thats why I had "" around it :D, Do you know of any standardized way of writing singletons with for jQuery?
[12:45:00] <ajpiano> rio{: there isn't one, really
[12:45:17] <rio{> Ok
[12:45:20] <ajpiano> rio{: do you ever even want the user to do $(document).yourThing() ?
[12:45:43] <rio{> not really
[12:45:46] <ajpiano> or would it suffice to just write the thing as a module
[12:47:24] <ajpiano> so then i would probably just do var mySingleton = (function() {  var foo = "bar", $doc = $(document); function private() { };  return { publicMethod: function(){}};   })();

[13:21:01] <morficus> hey guys - is it possible to use Basic Auth while doing a cross-domain AJAX request?
[13:21:42] <DanGer> morficus: it is
[13:22:06] <morficus> I have "xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + base64);"  in beforeSend... but it seems like the header isn't being sent  :-(
[13:22:08] <fotoflo> hey all. i am reading someone's jquery code and I see them using a naming convention with a $ at the beginning of a variable, for example :  $controls  = $('<div class="video-controls"></div>' ).appendTo( $video );        What is this convention?  (and where is a good place to learn more about these and other best practices?)
[13:22:22] <bot-t> fotoflo, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[13:22:53] <fotoflo> "Hungarian Notation"?
[13:23:19] <bot-t> fotoflo, Hungarian notation - Hungarian notation is an identifier naming convention in computer programming, in which the name of a variable or function indicates its type or intended use. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation
[13:23:28] <DanGer> morficus: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ - you can pass username/password arguments...
[13:23:42] <fotoflo> ah
[13:23:43] <morficus> DanGer: tried that... didn't work
[13:24:49] <zulax> so its not possiblet to display in image during alert() ?
[13:25:08] <morficus> DanGer: when I try that - I get the following error:  Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied"
[13:25:19] <fotoflo> Thank you.
[13:27:57] <fotoflo> There is quite a lot of syntax he is using that I haven't used before….  https://github.com/davist11/YouTube-Chromeless/blob/master/jquery.ytchromeless.js   for example lines 57 - 72.  function({ 'attr' : anonFunction(){ realFunction()  }   })
[13:29:45] <fotoflo> throwing .bind() an object with lots of pairs, a 'string' : function(){ namedFunction()  }
[13:30:42] <fotoflo> What is the best way to why he is doing and why he is doing it that way?
[13:37:27] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to query/js maybesome can give me a hint: how can i assure that a onkeyup event is only fired if x seconds afterwards no new keyup event is fired? i ve no idea how to solve that :-/

[13:52:36] <nmee> Hi, I'm working with the draggable/droppable functions in jQuery UI. I want to use { revert: true }, but I want the element to revert immediately when dropped in a valid area, and slide back (default) when dropped in an invalid area. Is this possible? (the reason being I don't want the element to disappear even when dropped successfully)
[14:03:36] <fotoflo> nmee: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-revertDuration
[14:04:24] <fotoflo> nmee: set revertDuration when dropped on the target

[14:22:38] <black_warlock> guys
[14:22:52] <black_warlock> i have an input field with validation
[14:23:11] <black_warlock> example a mail address
[14:23:31] <coldhead> cool
[14:23:49] <gloomer> fun fun
[14:24:32] <black_warlock> i have setted up the function that check on .keyup
[14:24:45] <black_warlock> but
[14:24:56] <black_warlock> it works if sombody types
[14:25:20] <lxsameer> how can i select the sibling node?
[14:25:28] <black_warlock> but if the lcache of the browser show some used email
[14:25:42] <black_warlock> and push one of them
[14:25:50] <black_warlock> the validator doesnt start
[14:26:01] <black_warlock> how can i solve this ?
[14:26:56] <gloomer> lsxameer .siblings()
[14:27:39] <gloomer> so you just want to validate after page load black_warlock
[14:37:52] <black_warlock> ye
[14:37:56] <Adys> is there a way to get the top/left/bottom/right css values as pixels, without having to substring .css("top") etc?
[14:38:03] <black_warlock> its working
[14:38:26] <black_warlock> but if sombody select the email from the cached list will not verify the disponibility
[14:38:47] <gloomer> because no keydown right
[14:38:51] <black_warlock> yep
[14:38:58] <black_warlock> thats exactlly the point
[14:39:14] <EDK> here you may see i can fetch my course name on the input field but i want to know how can i fetch another field (precio) value on the input field
[14:39:15] <EDK> http://jsfiddle.net/zd2rg/4/
[14:39:19] <EDK> thanks in advance
[14:39:43] <gloomer> black_warlock so just call your function on the other event as well
[14:39:54] <EDK> do i need to call div and its input values
[14:40:05] <EDK> if yes then how can i do it?
[14:40:13] <black_warlock> and wut is the name of other event ?
[14:41:01] <gloomer> let me see the code
[14:41:18] <gloomer> let me look EDK
[14:42:00] <EDK> sure
[14:42:37] <EDK> anyway.. thanks in advance
[14:43:09] <black_warlock> my code its this one http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Nkb57/
[14:43:21] <black_warlock> and it works if sombody types
[14:44:09] <EDK>   my code its this one http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Nkb57/
[14:44:10] <black_warlock> as you can see the last line i have tried .change
[14:44:11] <EDK> [23:43] <black_warlock> and it works if sombody types
[14:44:22] <EDK> sorry
[14:44:38] <gloomer> What are you trying to do EDK?
[14:44:53] <EDK> <black:warlock> you forget to add your html and select the jquery from the dropdown
[14:45:20] <black_warlock> its no needed :P
[14:45:26] <black_warlock> will not work in any case
[14:45:35] <black_warlock> cant run the off page of validation
[14:45:55] <black_warlock> yo fetch the other field EDK you have to add some code
[14:45:56] <EDK> gloomer: i am just trying to pass select div input values into another input values
[14:46:16] <black_warlock> what value you wanna put on the second input form ?
[14:46:23] <EDK> i am now thinking to call that div and fetch its all input values
[14:46:41] <EDK> and pass to the another input fiels
[14:46:57] <black_warlock> don need to
[14:47:01] <EDK> really?
[14:47:03] <pdpi> Is there any known issue with jqueryUI autocomplete being applied to an element that's not actually inserted into the document yet?
[14:47:05] <EDK> then how?
[14:48:19] <EDK> keep in mind that these field especually price_original and price_final are in hidden
[14:48:23] <black_warlock> onchange
[14:48:39] <black_warlock> but what values do you wanna pass to the second field ?
[14:48:51] <EDK> price_final
[14:49:29] <black_warlock> it means when you select one of radio buttons , it put the price in the first input ?
[14:49:48] <black_warlock> and you have to make some operation on that value ?
[14:50:02] <black_warlock> like tax calculation ?
[14:50:13] <EDK> fist input field is for course title and another field is for price
[14:50:16] <EDK> ok?
[14:50:23] <felipe_Brz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8555467/how-to-make-a-custom-icon-only-jquery-ui-button-widget
[14:50:34] <EDK> so first field is working.. i am fetching the value as you may see
[14:51:00] <EDK> but only problem with another field price_final which is in hidden and i want to pass it into another input field
[14:51:31] <gloomer> so you want to pass value of hidden input field to another visible input?
[14:51:44] <EDK> exactly
[14:53:08] <EDK> any idea guys ?
[14:54:32] <black_warlock> sec writing it
[14:57:23] <black_warlock> but
[14:57:30] <black_warlock> why dont u use ids
[14:57:33] <black_warlock> lol
[14:57:35] <black_warlock> sec
[14:58:24] <dogarrhea2> why does draggable() change the element into a "position relative" kind of element ?
[14:59:10] <black_warlock> ahhh
[14:59:15] <black_warlock> you have a problem here
[14:59:33] <black_warlock> but can be solved with .closest or .find
[14:59:35] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/zd2rg/7/
[14:59:36] <gloomer> EDK
[15:00:50] <EDK> yes
[15:00:54] <EDK> i can see it
[15:01:09] <EDK> but i want this value will be placed into another input field
[15:01:16] <EDK> not on the same field
[15:01:30] <EDK> but really thanks your effort
[15:02:39] <black_warlock> there is a problem
[15:02:46] <gloomer> ok well same principle
[15:02:48] <black_warlock> he must find the closest inputs
[15:02:57] <black_warlock> to that radio
[15:03:09] <black_warlock> since he doesnt have unique ids on the other fields
[15:04:03] <gloomer> EDK http://jsfiddle.net/zd2rg/10/
[15:04:34] <EDK> yes i can see
[15:04:46] <EDK> but price value is here always the same
[15:04:51] <EDK> it should be different
[15:05:06] <gloomer> different based on what?
[15:05:27] <EDK> as you can see ... each course has different price value
[15:06:14] <EDK> and wether i select course first or second.. value is the same but i want it must display price value related with its course
[15:07:37] <EDK> another course price value is 195
[15:07:49] <EDK> and it always get 95 which is the value of first course
[15:08:05] <EDK> http://jsfiddle.net/zd2rg/12/
[15:10:18] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/zd2rg/17/
[15:11:56] <gloomer> that should work if your always going to layout your hidden inputs like that
[15:13:34] <EDK> thanksssssssssssssss
[15:13:38] <EDK> it really works :)
[15:13:44] <EDK> thanks alot indeed
[15:16:36] <black_warlock> hum what will happen if he got more sub inputs hidden ?
[15:18:07] <gloomer> depends on what he wanted to do with those more sub inputs
[15:21:30] <black_warlock> im not very expert :P
[15:21:57] <gloomer> ya next() just goes to next node
[15:22:21] <gloomer> so it just gets the value of the node next after the textbox
[15:23:04] <black_warlock> i would have used .find
[15:23:19] <black_warlock> inspecting the div
[15:23:49] <black_warlock> but i guess there are thousand solutions :D
[15:24:16] <black_warlock> by the way is it possible to set 2 behavior on the same function ?
[15:24:40] <black_warlock> like .keyup, .change,.blur
[15:25:21] <gloomer> yes
[15:25:32] <black_warlock> sintax ? :)
[15:25:35] <black_warlock> $('#user_check').keyup(function() {	
[15:25:53] <gloomer> put it on jfiddle and ill edit it
[15:26:40] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Nkb57/
[15:29:16] <black_warlock> want the html ?

[16:05:25] <d4rklit3> When using the Universal Embed Code, you can call these by sending a serialized JSON object with postMessage() to the <iframe>.
[16:05:34] <d4rklit3> im not sure how to do that w/ jquery

[16:10:41] <EDK> what do you mean?
[16:10:49] <d4rklit3> anyone know hwo to do this w/ jquery? When using the Universal Embed Code, you can call these by sending a serialized JSON object with postMessage() to the <iframe>. The following format should be used: (Omit the value key if the method requires no value.)

[16:17:19] <gloomer> N3w8ee it looks like something on the span class
[16:17:46] <gloomer> so look at css classes applied to the span
[16:20:41] <gloomer> N3w8ee maybe display tag on <a href tag

[16:49:06] <coldhead> no, not that
[16:49:21] <coldhead> actually maybe that
[16:49:24] <sweetgrass> gloomer: yes. I tried storing the inner html in a var and then replacing the div with the content but it ended up replacing every instance with the first item
[16:49:25] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[16:49:43] <sweetgrass> coldhead: i literally just found unwrap
[16:50:19] <sweetgrass> coldhead: well, you're obviously much better suited to jquery than myself
[16:51:06] <gloomer> ya i didnt know about unwrap either so go coldhead :)
[16:53:21] <coldhead> unwrap seems to work okay: http://jsfiddle.net/bbKh9/
[16:54:16] <coldhead> and this might be a better selector http://jsfiddle.net/bbKh9/1/
[16:54:27] <coldhead> i wonder what happens with text nodes
[16:54:57] <sweetgrass> gloomer: i just discovered wrap and wrapAll last night
[16:54:58] <coldhead> apparently it works like a fucking beaner on textnodes http://jsfiddle.net/bbKh9/2/
[16:55:49] <sweetgrass> :)
[16:59:09] <sweetgrass> coldhead: thanks. that works lovely
[17:00:40] <gwern> I have a tool which generates my HTML and adds divs for each section like '<div class="section level1" id="telling-the-good-from-bad">' with 'levelX' varying as is obvious; can jquery match if I just specify $("section ")?
[17:01:44] <coldhead> $('.section')
[17:02:19] <gwern> coldhead: I'll look at that, I didn't expect the built-ins or whatever the . and : things are to work for a prefix match
[17:13:28] <N3w8ee> thanks for all your help
[17:14:43] <gwern> coldhead: seems to work, thanks
[17:16:40] <coldhead> gwern: the classnames should all be independent -- you can select any of them, regardless of what other classes an element has. order and what not don't matter
[17:29:00] <ed1t> How can I get a value of all the fields by class and then pass it as parameters to the $.ajax call? I want the parameter name to be the same as the id of the field
[17:36:33] <pdpi> I asked earlier but had to leave before there was time to answer: I'm having issues with a jqueryUI autocomplete() call on some elements. Same call works in some cases, doesn't work in others, difference seems to be that in the cases where it doesn't work the target element is in a document fragment that's not attached to the main document yet.
[17:36:37] <execute> Is there any shorter syntax for an `a b, a c` selector? Something like `a (b or c)`
[17:38:27] <ryanseddon> ed1t: $("form .class").serialize()
[17:51:06] <systemfault> Anyone knows a good custom <select> plugin
[17:53:14] <gloomer> <select> plugin?
[17:53:17] <gloomer> to do what?
[17:54:05] <systemfault> Styling :/
[17:54:12] <gloomer> jquery ui?
[17:54:44] <systemfault> I'll check.. wanted to see if I could find something simpler..
[17:55:44] <pdpi> chosen's also pretty neat.
[17:55:54] <systemfault> Yeah.. but seems it doesn't support IE7 :(
[17:58:02] <systemfault> JQueryUI seems unusable if you don't like the default styling.
[18:03:57] <danzik17> systemfault: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[18:08:33] <execute> systemfault, how you figure that?
[18:09:03] <systemfault> Because I checked the CSS.
[18:09:53] <execute> systemfault, its templating system is pretty great, it allows you great flexibility in styling it to fit your needs
[18:10:01] <execute> dunno what you mean by "checked the css"
[18:12:05] <systemfault> Easy.. you open the .css file then see that you cannot easily change the style of a single component without messing everything up.
[18:18:17] <spiffie> I don't know, I've done it a couple times. the first time was just a few adjustments and the second time I rewrote the provided styles entirely as SASS. the only really tricky parts were how ui-widget-headers were treated across widgets and replacing ui-icons.
[18:18:51] <execute> systemfault, its built in a way that re-uses classes in multiple places to reuse common styling - which is the way it should be
[18:19:21] <execute> systemfault, play a bit with the template picker, it has a UI for changing colors/images/etc, see how it effects the CSS
[18:24:34] <numerical25> is it possible to disable easing in jquery animation ?
[18:26:54] <ftsf> hi, is change() supposed to fire on blur on a text input if nothing has changed?
[18:27:54] <gloomer> it fires if the elements value changes
[18:29:01] <ftsf> hmm =\ seems to be firing for me whenever i blur the focus on it. even when the value hasn't changed
[18:30:50] <gloomer> jfiddle it
[18:30:53] <gloomer> let me see
[18:33:04] <ftsf> actually i think i'm wrong... must be some other event
[18:33:17] <ftsf> at least i hope i'm wrong =)
[19:00:50] <Jonno_FTW> when using .ajax is there is a difference between dataType: "json" and "jsonp" ?
[19:01:00] <jcrawford> guys i read in the jquery docs that toggle() will toggle the visibility of an element.  I noticed that uses display: none/block. is there a jquery function that uses visibility: hidden/visible?
[19:01:25] <Eviltwin> Jonno_FTW: It's the difference between using JSON and JSONP
[19:01:39] <niftylettuce> does anyone see problems using `jQuery.noConflict()(function($) {` ? is that the right shorthand function?
[19:01:59] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: You can use .css("visibility","visible") and .css("visibility","hidden") instead
[19:02:13] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce: get rid of the "()"
[19:02:15] <niftylettuce> I added $ since it wasn't in the docs
[19:02:32] <niftylettuce> Eviltwin: docs have the () in it
[19:02:38] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: yes but then I will have to check the visibility before setting it
[19:03:03] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[19:03:33] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: You can also do this: .toggle(function(){/*1*/},function(){/*2*/})
[19:03:52] <Eviltwin> The first time you click it, it will run the code /*1*/ and the second time it will run /*2*/ and the third time /*1*/ again
[19:03:56] <Eviltwin> And so on
[19:04:03] <niftylettuce> Eviltwin: basically I'm trying to do this, but shorthand: `$.noConflict(); jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... });` -- what would be the best approach?
[19:04:20] <jcrawford> Thanks Eviltwin
[19:04:27] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce: Correct
[19:05:06] <niftylettuce> Eviltwin: jQuery.noConflict(function($) { // code using $ here });    ?
[19:05:44] <techouse> how to make jquery select only each certain node and not its children with .each?
[19:05:57] <Eviltwin> First of all, do you understand the difference between foo(); and $(document).ready(function(){foo();}); ?
[19:06:14] <Eviltwin> techouse: Can you rephrase that?
[19:06:39] <techouse> Eviltwin: hmm
[19:06:43] <niftylettuce> Eviltwin: if you're asking me, yes
[19:06:48] <Eviltwin> techouse: I don't understand your question
[19:06:56] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce: What is the difference?
[19:07:06] <techouse> well, i got a bunch of <div class="myclass" id="myid"> and i wanna remove the id
[19:07:53] <niftylettuce> are you suggestion the difference is when document el is ready run foo()?
[19:07:57] <techouse> and well if i use $.('div.myclass').each(function(){$.(this).attr('id').remove()}
[19:07:57] <niftylettuce>  /s/suggestion/suggesting
[19:08:05] <niftylettuce> i mean, that part is obvious?
[19:08:05] <techouse> it removes all children ids as well
[19:08:27] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce: I'm telling you that unless you have a $(document).ready somewhere in there, it's going to be run before document ready
[19:08:37] <Eviltwin> Or effective syntax
[19:08:52] <niftylettuce> yeah, im gonna have it load after doc dom ready, thx
[19:09:19] <jcrawford> hmm Eviltwin i cannot seem to get this to work, 	$(".panelsContainer .collapsible .panelHeader").click(function() {
[19:09:19] <jcrawford> 		$(this).siblings('.panelBody').toggle(function(){ $(this).css("visibility", "visible") },function(){ $(this).css("visibility", "hidden") });
[19:09:19] <jcrawford> 	});
[19:09:20] <Eviltwin> techouse: $(this).removeAttr('id') is what you want
[19:09:27] <techouse> aha
[19:09:46] <Eviltwin> niftylettuce: I suggest you try this: $(function($){...});$.noConflict();
[19:09:50] <Eviltwin> Probably the shortest you're going to get
[19:10:02] <Eviltwin> The first $ refers to jQuery since noConflict hasn't happened yet
[19:10:17] <Eviltwin> The second one (inside the ()'s) makes $ be jQuery inside that scope no matter what
[19:10:25] <Eviltwin> Then the last bit does the noConflict
[19:10:52] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: Oh, one thing is you can't actually click "visibility:hidden" elements
[19:11:04] <Eviltwin> I forgot to mention that but I should have realized
[19:11:12] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: right I am clicking the header which makes the body visible :D
[19:11:13] <Eviltwin> Try "opacity", 0 and "opacity",1 instead
[19:11:17] <Eviltwin> Oh
[19:11:18] <Eviltwin> Waht
[19:11:20] <Eviltwin> Wait*
[19:11:32] <Eviltwin> So the header makes the body visibile or not
[19:11:40] <jcrawford> yes well I want it to toggle
[19:11:48] <Eviltwin> K, give me a sec
[19:11:55] <jcrawford> the issue is I cannot use display:none because the panels then overlap my footer
[19:12:41] <jcrawford> ahh crap nevermind cant use visibility: either because that leaves white space where the body would be
[19:12:47] <jcrawford> trying to make the layout expand
[19:12:48] <techouse> yea, use .css('opacity',0)
[19:12:55] <jcrawford> must be a css issue I am having then
[19:13:20] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: http://jsfiddle.net/4FBuC/
[19:14:23] <Eviltwin> jcrawford: Or reversed, http://jsfiddle.net/4FBuC/1/
[19:14:45] <Eviltwin> If you're trying to figure out CSS-wise how you want this to look, I suggest you visit #css
[19:14:50] <Eviltwin> That's kind of what they do
[19:15:07] <techouse> make sure to use .css('filter','alpha(opacity=0)') for ie
[19:15:40] <Eviltwin> Make sure to not support IE so the people still using it are finally forced to switch
[19:15:47] <techouse> :D
[19:16:09] <techouse> tell me about it, just finished a noscript CSS for ie7 without
[19:16:11] <techouse> :/
[19:16:36] <techouse> the damn bugger has a bug with adjacent elements :P
[19:16:56] <Jonno_FTW> does serializeArray() only work on forms?
[19:18:04] <Jonno_FTW> because I have a form.div.item which has input elements but I can't call serializeArray() on them
[19:18:36] <jcrawford> Eviltwin: no I thought my issue was JS but it turns out it is CSS.  The panel body would overlap my footer when visible
[19:19:16] <jcrawford> I was going to use visibility because then it was just hidden but I cannot gurantee this to be the last element before the footer and when the body is hidden I would want that space used, thats all I was saying :) thought it was JS but turned out not to be
[19:43:37] <nsheretic> does anyone know what http response headers a jquery .get() is expecting?
[19:43:54] <coldhead> it likes 200 OK, nsheretic
[19:44:03] <nsheretic> yes, i've got that
[19:44:05] <coldhead> it isn't much fussed about the others
[19:44:14] <coldhead> it will try to handle the content-type if it recognises it
[19:44:15] <nsheretic> but somehow it never receives the response
[19:44:25] <nsheretic> i'm trying to do Content-Type: application/json
[19:44:28] <nsheretic> and send it a json object
[19:44:35] <coldhead> is your json valid?
[19:44:41] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[19:44:41] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[19:44:49] <nsheretic> all it is is "data":"<number>"
[19:44:54] <coldhead> that's not valid
[19:45:05] <nsheretic> dang w3schools
[19:45:21] <nsheretic> but i've also tried sending text/html back
[19:45:27] <nsheretic> with valid html
[19:45:30] <nsheretic> i've got firebut
[19:45:34] <nsheretic> firebug*
[19:45:37] <nsheretic> and the response shows up
[19:45:39] <nsheretic> but it's in red
[19:45:43] <nsheretic> and it sees my headers
[19:45:45] <nsheretic> but none of the response
[19:46:03] <coldhead> that's by the by
[19:46:14] <coldhead> if you need json, try to get it working with valid json
[19:46:22] <nsheretic> k
[19:46:27] <nsheretic> i just want to send it a number
[19:46:30] <nsheretic> that's it
[19:46:41] <coldhead> paste your stuff into jsonlint
[19:46:45] <coldhead> fix whatever it complains about
[19:46:53] <coldhead> and repeat until you get the green light
[19:47:14] <Jonno_FTW> ok
[19:47:25] <nsheretic> ok i fixed it
[19:47:29] <nsheretic> it works
[19:47:31] <nsheretic> in jsonlint
[19:47:43] <coldhead> okay so now try sending the working data back from your server
[19:47:48] <nsheretic> same thing
[19:48:02] <coldhead> so
[19:48:04] <coldhead> you have 200 OK
[19:48:08] <coldhead> and valid json
[19:48:14] <nsheretic> yes
[19:48:16] <coldhead> and still no success
[19:48:24] <nsheretic> lemme pastebin literally what i'm sending back
[19:49:34] <nsheretic> is there a pastebin you prefer
[19:49:38] <nsheretic> or just pastebin
[19:49:42] <coldhead> ?p
[19:49:43] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[19:49:48] <nsheretic> ah there we go
[19:49:49] <coldhead> i like the ones with fewer ads
[19:50:22] <nsheretic> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/522850/
[19:50:30] <nsheretic> that is what my server is sending back
[19:50:46] <nsheretic> and then in my .get() callback i'm just trying to alert(data)
[19:51:05] <coldhead> can you paste the actual code?
[19:51:10] <nsheretic> sure
[19:51:53] <nsheretic> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/522851/
[19:52:30] <coldhead> is <mywebsite> a different domain to the one that is hosting your javascript?
[19:53:19] <nsheretic> yes
[19:53:24] <nsheretic> my javascript is just running on localhost
[19:53:31] <nsheretic> i'm testing it
[19:53:36] <nsheretic> so i just load the html in firefox
[19:53:37] <coldhead> and it's requesting data from localhost
[19:53:46] <coldhead> ah you load the file with file:/// ?
[19:53:53] <coldhead> or http://localhost/
[19:54:04] <coldhead> ajax doesn't work with file:///
[19:54:17] <nsheretic> i don't use file:/// anywhere
[19:54:22] <coldhead> okay okay
[19:54:25] <nsheretic> this isn't to upload the file yet
[19:54:26] <nsheretic> i have that working
[19:54:32] <nsheretic> it's just to request a file upload id
[19:54:40] <nsheretic> so it can ping the server for the percent uploaded
[19:54:41] <coldhead> i'm still wondering about the <mywebsite> bit
[19:54:42] <nsheretic> and display a progress bar
[19:54:48] <coldhead> can you keep that as short as possible
[19:54:49] <nsheretic> that's just what i threw in
[19:54:52] <nsheretic> instead of the actual url
[19:55:01] <nsheretic> short?
[19:55:07] <coldhead> and just make it /foo/whatever.asp instead of localhost/foo/whatever.asp
[19:55:20] <nsheretic> it's not localhost
[19:55:22] <coldhead> relative
[19:55:27] <coldhead> you told me it was
[19:55:30] <coldhead> >:\\
[19:55:32] <nsheretic> i'm sorry i misunderstood
[19:55:38] <nsheretic> i thought you meant where the html file was
[19:56:20] <nsheretic> all i want to be able to do is sent a getJSON request to http://idrequest.mywebsite.com
[19:56:27] <coldhead> right right right
[19:56:28] <nsheretic> and have my server send back an id
[19:56:32] <coldhead> the caveat is
[19:56:38] <coldhead> your JS ALSO has to be on that domain
[19:56:51] <nsheretic> ooooh
[19:57:00] <coldhead> foo.com/i_request_json.js can only access json at foo.com
[19:57:11] <coldhead> aids.com/i_request_json.js cannot access json at foo.com
[19:57:24] <nsheretic> so I have to have a <script src='http://idrequest.mywebsite.com/myJS.js'>?
[19:57:29] <coldhead> yes!
[19:57:34] <nsheretic> i see!
[19:57:38] <coldhead> that should work fine
[19:57:44] <nsheretic> thanks so much.
[19:57:47] <coldhead> it's the same origin policy

[19:58:16] <nsheretic> been searching forums for hours
[20:00:05] <Jonno_FTW> well?
[20:00:32] <nsheretic> coldhead, one more question
[20:00:40] <nsheretic> does the js have to come from the same subdomain?
[20:00:44] <coldhead> how's your impatience, Jonno_FTW
[20:00:52] <coldhead> nsheretic: usually, yes
[20:00:55] <nsheretic> k
[20:01:03] <Jonno_FTW> it's getting sleep deprived
[20:01:05] <coldhead> you can mess with security settings and it will work in some browsers

[20:01:11] <coldhead> Jonno_FTW: http://jsfiddle.net/AMgEE/7/
[20:01:13] <nsheretic> coldhead: will do
[20:01:35] <coldhead> you have to run serializeArray on actual input elements, not a div that merely contains them
[20:01:52] <coldhead> also there was a syntax error
[20:02:59] <Jonno_FTW> where?
[20:03:14] <coldhead> there was a ) in the wrong place
[20:03:30] <coldhead> the second last }) was just } or )}
[20:03:33] <coldhead> i can't remember

[20:04:46] <Jonno_FTW> thanks
[20:05:12] <Jonno_FTW> coldhead: it doesn't work for select elements though
[20:06:06] <coldhead> try .find(':input')
[20:06:09] <coldhead> that will match selects

[20:08:15] <peterschmidler> gloomer: how
[20:09:14] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/
[20:10:06] <peterschmidler> gloomer: http://jsfiddle.net/peterschmidler/7Xe9F/
[20:12:14] <gloomer> add the html code at least a framework of it and some simple css
[20:12:19] <gloomer> so you can see what your issue is
[20:12:27] <peterschmidler> gloomer: mom
[20:17:22] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: Don't use classes as IDs and don't use selectors when you don't have to
[20:18:17] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: You're creating a div with "style 1" as its class and then trying to select ".style .1" in the next line
[20:18:23] <Eviltwin> You just had a reference to it in the previous line
[20:18:29] <Eviltwin> Just save it in a var
[20:18:46] <Eviltwin> Also ".style .1" refers to an element with class "1" somewhere inside an element with class "style"
[20:18:54] <Eviltwin> Not an element with both classes style and 1
[20:18:57] <Eviltwin> That would be ".style.1"
[20:19:06] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: aah
[20:19:37] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: It worked! Thank you so much.
[20:20:41] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: http://jsfiddle.net/7Xe9F/2/
[20:20:57] <Eviltwin> Don't select when you already have a reference
[20:21:14] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: yea
[20:22:26] <nsheretic> coldhead: many thanks, the json response works great now
[20:22:40] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: There had to be a simpler solution ;)
[20:22:42] <coldhead> good work nsheretic
[20:36:54] <ParadoxQuine> hey folks, is there a difference between find(stuff).first(), find(stuff:first), and find(stuff).filter(:first)?
[20:37:26] <Eviltwin> The beauty of jQuery is there are about a billion different ways to do anything
[20:37:44] <Eviltwin> I suspect the performance of .first() is still the fastest
[20:37:48] <Eviltwin> But I don't know for sure
[20:37:53] <Eviltwin> You could do a jsperf
[20:37:54] <danzik17> ParadoxQuine: the first way you wrote is the best way if you need to use :first - the pseudo selectors are slow
[20:38:36] <ParadoxQuine> great, thanks Eviltwin and danzik17!
[20:38:40] <danzik17> Eviltwin: yup, you're right - i've jsperfed it before, you'd be surprised just how much slower it is
[20:39:23] <ParadoxQuine> and just to make sure i'm not missing anything - there's no counterpart to closest() right? i just have to achieve that with find().first()?
[20:39:26] <Eviltwin> danzik17: This surprised me: http://jsperf.com/crazy-selectors
[20:39:49] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: With .closest, there's a nice chain of ancestry
[20:39:56] <Eviltwin> Only one element at each progressive level
[20:40:03] <Eviltwin> With descendants, it's a tree
[20:40:14] <Eviltwin> .find returns results in DOM order
[20:40:46] <Eviltwin> The last element may actually be higher than some of the ones in the middle etc.
[20:41:09] <ParadoxQuine> ahh ok, makes sense
[20:41:20] <Eviltwin> So in other wrods
[20:41:21] <danzik17> ParadoxQuine: what are you trying to do?  would :first-child work for you?
[20:41:21] <Eviltwin> words*
[20:41:25] <Eviltwin> If you were to read the HTML
[20:41:36] <Eviltwin> The order you would read in would be the order .find would find them
[20:41:54] <Eviltwin> Assuming you're reading straight through
[20:41:57] <ParadoxQuine> right, depth first
[20:42:08] <Eviltwin> Actually an in-order traversal
[20:42:36] <Eviltwin> Which is one of the three types of depth first for trees
[20:42:41] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: what's .closest?
[20:42:42] <Eviltwin> Well
[20:42:49] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: see ?closest
[20:42:50] <bot-t> peterschmidler, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[20:42:54] <danzik17> Eviltwin: surprised that those selectors are relatively equivalent except in opera?
[20:43:14] <Eviltwin> peterschmidler: BTW api.jquery.com is a fantastic place to go to answer such questions
[20:43:35] <Eviltwin> danzik17: I was actually expecting the selector to be slower overall because of its relative complexity
[20:43:47] <Eviltwin> But I supose simulating DFAs for regexes isn't terribly fast
[20:44:13] <Eviltwin> But yeah, Opera shocked me
[20:44:21] <Eviltwin> Amazingly fast at processing that selector
[20:44:37] <dogarrhea2> is there any way to cancel the click event on an element that is draggable?
[20:44:40] <danzik17> Eviltwin: well, if i had to guess - its a combination of the regex and additional function call - with the exception of :not, the original selectors should all work in native QSA i think
[20:45:01] <peterschmidler> Eviltwin: Thx
[20:45:02] <danzik17> or matchesSelector, whatever it delegates to in sizzle
[20:45:07] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Like return false?
[20:45:40] <Eviltwin> danzik17: I guess I expected precompiled regexes to be faster
[20:45:45] <erdos> hey everyone
[20:46:32] <danzik17> Eviltwin: heh.  if you really want to see something crazy, run this perf in chrome
[20:46:33] <danzik17> http://jsperf.com/ridiculous-json-perf-case/3
[20:46:41] <danzik17> it's an edge case i discovered several months ago
[20:46:57] <dogarrhea2> Eviltwin, there are some other elements i want to actually listen to a click
[20:46:59] <dogarrhea2> but not while dragging
[20:47:01] <erdos> i'm trying to do a dropdown menu with .hover and .slideDown .slideUp. but when i stop a currently active animation that sets a max height for slideup slidedown and they no longer slide to their full length
[20:47:03] <erdos> here the code
[20:47:04] <erdos> http://pastie.org/3039083
[20:47:24] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Wow, that's really weird
[20:47:37] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:47:42] <Eviltwin> danzik17: Wow, that's really weird
[20:47:53] <erdos> it's like the .stop() call changes something to do with slideup slidedown parameters..
[20:48:12] <Eviltwin> erdos: Did you see ?.stop ?
[20:48:12] <bot-t> erdos, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[20:48:22] <Eviltwin> The parameters and what they mean
[20:48:44] <danzik17> Eviltwin: yep :)  btw, the test array in that happens to be the case for the distinct method we were talking about the other night, just with the data replaced with bogus data of course
[20:49:24] <Eviltwin> Nice
[20:49:26] <dogarrhea2> so i never really found an answer to what a ui.helper is..
[20:49:26] <erdos> yeah i did but shouldn't it just stop the currently running animation? for the next animation it only tweens to the point where the previous one was stopped
[20:50:44] <Eviltwin> erdos: That's because slideUp and slideDown try to save some information about where they were when they started
[20:50:58] <Eviltwin> erdos: Do you know how tall the ULs are?
[20:51:25] <Eviltwin> If so, you may want to look at animating those numbers directly
[20:51:26] <erdos> umm, i guess i could figure it out..
[20:51:44] <erdos> but shouldn't there be a way just to reset it?
[20:51:50] <danzik17> Eviltwin: anyway, if youre interested - courtesy of alex russel:
[20:51:56] <danzik17> "need to profile to be sure -- afk atm -- but likely object transitions and "delete" triggering megamorphic property lookup"
[20:53:45] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a reasonable guess
[20:56:04] <erdos> so what would be the correct way of doing a dropdown menu that doesn't queue up heaps of events when you move the mouse too quickly over the menu items? i don't understand why stop() sets the bounds for further animations.. i can't see an instance where that would be useful
[20:56:32] <Eviltwin> It's been a pleasure talking to you all but I unfortunately must be going
[20:56:37] <Eviltwin> Have to wake up early tomorrow
[20:56:41] <Eviltwin> See ya
[20:56:42] <erdos> later
[20:56:44] <Eviltwin> Good luck
[20:59:04] <erdos> hmm perhaps it's to do with the fact that i'm using find to identify the elements
[21:00:34] <Guest74901> anyone know if .pem file is one that gets created when you do ssh-keygen -t rsa ?
[21:01:35] <fris> .pem ? no
[21:03:40] <someprimetime> is the best way to handle all modal popups to just hide them or fetch the content asynchronously? i'm thinking of "Share popup boxes" "login forms" "signup forms" etc
[21:04:22] <erdos> >.<
[21:05:06] <dogarrhea2> hrm i have something that is draggable. when it's not dragging, i want the click interaction to take place. when it is dragging i don't want the click interaaction to take place, but it does anyways
[21:05:08] <dogarrhea2> how do i stop that
[21:05:13] <dogarrhea2> it's quite annoying
[21:06:38] <dogarrhea2> ok nevermind some global hacking variables did the trick
[21:06:51] <dogarrhea2> i love hacking and putting poor design in my code to make things work
[21:07:12] <dogarrhea2> if(hasClass("im dragging now")) etc. etc.
[21:19:56] <trumpetmic> anyone familiar with the meetup.com api, and can you help me export some of their past events?
[21:25:50] <gloomer> trumpetmic not familiar but show me problem and ill help\
[21:27:33] <erdos> >>>>.<<<<
[21:27:39] <erdos> why?!!?
[21:28:00] <erdos> what does stop affect that limits the bounds on animations with slideup/slidedown
[21:28:28] <erdos> surely manually calculating the heights of elements and using animate is wrong
[21:28:57] <coldhead> do you have a test case to demonstrate your woes?
[21:29:05] <erdos> sure 1 sec
[21:30:09] <erdos> http://www.labfiftyfive.com/woes/
[21:30:21] <erdos> so hover over one of the menu items then quickly hover out
[21:30:34] <erdos> before the animation finishes, then hover over it again
[21:30:55] <erdos> actually 1 sec
[21:30:59] <erdos> i was editting something
[21:31:43] <erdos> ok look now
[21:32:35] <erdos> if you look at my script.js the part below that's commented out works fine but it seems wrong to calculate heights of the elements at the page load and store them for later
[21:34:46] <erdos> thoughts coldhead?
[21:34:48] <coldhead> i think you're supposed to use stop(true, true) in situations like this
[21:35:18] <coldhead> i have previously used hoverIntent and ben alman's debounce plugin
[21:35:20] <erdos> sort of works, but makes it look ugly, that rushes the animation to the end of it's cycle
[21:36:17] <erdos> i've saved it, refresh and have a look with true true
[21:36:54] <coldhead> i think that looks fine
[21:36:57] <coldhead> and it works
[21:37:08] <erdos> nah, do some quick hovers
[21:37:29] <erdos> you'll see what i mean
[21:37:40] <coldhead> if i have a seizure with my mouse, sure, it doesn't look great
[21:37:46] <coldhead> but i can still navigate
[21:37:49] <coldhead> and get on with my life
[21:38:00] <coldhead> the lesson is that i, the user, shouldn't do that with my mouse
[21:38:21] <coldhead> i agree that cacheing the heights is awful
[21:38:27] <coldhead> so don't do that
[21:38:37] <erdos> seems like my only option at the moment
[21:38:45] <coldhead> ahem
[21:38:55] <coldhead> i seem to remember someone suggesting at least 2 other plugins
[21:38:56] <erdos> it's going to fuck me over though if a menu item goes over two lines
[21:39:00] <coldhead> that work in these contexts
[21:39:10] <erdos> which ones?
[21:39:19] <coldhead> <coldhead> i have previously used hoverIntent and ben alman's debounce plugin
[21:39:37] <erdos> oh ok, but won't i still have to cache the heights with those?
[21:39:54] <erdos> i'll have a look
[21:39:59] <erdos> thanks for your help :)
[21:40:31] <coldhead> they prevent the user fucking up your otherwise elegant code
[21:40:44] <coldhead> is why i like them
[21:41:29] <erdos> i've seen hoverintent in use before, actually i was trying to remember the name of it this morning before i started coding this from scratch, thanks for reminding me!
[21:42:02] <DJ_UNA> Hi... id like to update a div.. without refreshing the entire page: $("#login").load("index.php"); - how???
[21:42:37] <coldhead> ?load @ DJ_UNA
[21:42:37] <bot-t> DJ_UNA, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[21:42:38] <dogarrhea2> containment:[0,84,0,-294]     <----- what exactly does that mean?
[21:42:48] <dogarrhea2> is the coordinates relative coordinates?
[21:42:50] <coldhead> ?ajax.load @ DJ_UNA
[21:42:51] <bot-t> DJ_UNA, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[21:42:58] <coldhead> what you have should work, DJ_UNA
[21:43:02] <dogarrhea2> do i need to pass "0px"? hwo does it work? jquery ui doesn't really say in the documentation
[21:44:15] <coldhead> i have no idea, dogarrhea2, i would guess it's top left and bottom right
[21:44:17] <DJ_UNA> so, something like this? $('#login').load('index.php #inputs');
[21:44:28] <coldhead> that looks very fine, DJ_UNA
[21:44:31] <coldhead> very fine indeed
[21:44:43] <dogarrhea2> coldhead, it says x1,y1,x2,y2
[21:44:49] <dogarrhea2> which is basically 2 points
[21:45:02] <DJ_UNA> coldhead it works, but it double layers my div?
[21:45:11] <DJ_UNA> so there's 2 of them oO
[21:45:26] <dogarrhea2> sounds like you'd constrain on a line of some sort but it's all messed up. i take the silence as aknowledgement that draggable containment is completely broken
[21:45:43] <dogarrhea2> ok moving on to more important things
[21:46:53] <coldhead> dogarrhea2: top left, bottom right
[21:46:57] <coldhead> assume right angles
[21:47:02] <coldhead> that defines a box
[21:47:30] <dogarrhea2> relative to?
[21:47:41] <dogarrhea2> or what frame of reference
[21:47:55] <DJ_UNA> coldhead http://up-it.dk/uploads/111219/r85-doublelayer.png
[21:48:06] <DJ_UNA> how do i work that around? :D
[21:48:14] <coldhead> (a,b) (c,d) gives these points: (a,b), (c,b), (a,d), (c,d)
[21:48:38] <DJ_UNA> it doesnt reload, it doubles load it
[21:48:40] <coldhead> relative to 0, 0
[21:48:51] <dogarrhea2> ok. it is in fact a bug.
[21:48:57] <dogarrhea2> the coordinates are not associative
[21:48:57] <coldhead> ?empty @ DJ_UNA
[21:48:57] <bot-t> DJ_UNA, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[21:49:06] <coldhead> maybe try that first
[21:49:17] <dogarrhea2> 0,-294,0,84 is NOT the same as 0,84,0,-294
[21:49:24] <dogarrhea2> and one will produce different results than the other
[21:49:41] <DJ_UNA> so, $("#login").empty(); ?
[21:50:06] <dogarrhea2> it's either a documentatino bug or an actual behavior bug. either way it's undefined
[21:50:09] <dogarrhea2> how it should behave
[21:50:22] <dogarrhea2> too bad no one responds to new bugs in jqueryui bug tracker anymore
[21:50:24] <DJ_UNA> coldhead it then disappears, and does the same thing
[21:50:24] <coldhead> DJ_UNA: yeah
[21:50:38] <coldhead> you must have duplicates in your html then
[21:50:43] <coldhead> and it's loading both
[21:51:04] <coldhead> $('#login').load('index.php #inputs:first'); maybe
[21:51:10] <coldhead> that makes me want to throw up
[21:51:12] <coldhead> but there it is
[21:52:02] <nickdc> I would like to move the jquery ui slider on mouseover rather than a down click event. What functions should I look at to accomplish that?
[21:52:06] <DJ_UNA> can i load multiple, like this? $('#login').load('index.php #inputs #fbbox');
[21:53:34] <coldhead> i don't think so, DJ_UNA
[21:53:42] <dogarrhea2> oh well another bug with containment, the coordinates are relative positioning when the container is in fact position absolute
[21:53:46] <coldhead> but if you need something that complicated just use ?get
[21:53:46] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[21:53:47] <dogarrhea2> bah i hate this library
[21:53:50] <coldhead> er
[21:53:56] <coldhead> ?ajax.get
[21:53:57] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[21:54:15] <coldhead> DJ_UNA: that lets you provide a callback function which can do whatever tricky stuff you need
[21:54:41] <DJ_UNA> coldhead the problem is, when i load one thing, the other id in inside the same div disappears
[21:54:59] <coldhead> might need a working demo to look at DJ_UNA
[21:55:16] <coldhead> it works fine in my head
[21:55:34] <DJ_UNA> sr.dk - its the facebook connect, and then, when logged in it updates at the login box
[21:56:22] <coldhead> i assume i need a facebook account to access this
[21:56:26] <DJ_UNA> ya
[21:56:28] <coldhead> i am not your man for this task
[21:57:04] <DJ_UNA> i got a fake account u can borrow
[21:57:05] <DJ_UNA> lol
[21:57:14] <DJ_UNA> use it for testing myself
[21:57:44] <coldhead> i can't assist with facebook issues
[21:57:47] <coldhead> religious reasons
[21:57:49] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[21:58:06] <DJ_UNA> oh
[21:58:46] <DJ_UNA> religious? im curious
[21:59:13] <coldhead> i have religious feelings about human dignity which i believe facebook destroys
[21:59:35] <DJ_UNA> okay then
[21:59:47] <DJ_UNA> but thx so far anyway
[22:00:50] <coldhead> sure thing
[22:00:55] <nospinzy> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lb2cyd2LvE1qzdmw2o1_400.jpg
[22:01:15] <coldhead> there are a lot of people here who aren't conceited about facebook and will help
[22:01:19] <nospinzy> why is it downhill so soon after adolescence
[22:02:01] <DJ_UNA> coldhead u sure u cant load multiple divs somehow in a way like this? $('#login').load('index.php #inputs #lala #bla bla');
[22:02:11] <coldhead> pretty sure, DJ_UNA
[22:02:21] <DJ_UNA> would be neat though
[22:02:35] <coldhead> it would be confusing
[22:02:47] <coldhead> the pattern is meant to be 'url #optional_filter'
[22:03:03] <coldhead> and if you have #filter1 #fitler2 #filter3... how should they be joined?
[22:03:07] <coldhead> what if one contains another?
[22:03:07] <coldhead> etc
[22:03:35] <coldhead> also how to distinguish '#filter1', '#filter2' from '#filter1 #filter2'
[22:03:39] <coldhead> which mean different things
[22:03:47] <DJ_UNA> when im defining
[22:03:48] <DJ_UNA> $('#login').load('index.php #fbbox');
[22:04:01] <DJ_UNA> the other 'inputs' disapear
[22:04:14] <coldhead> the other inputs that are in #login ?
[22:04:24] <coldhead> that line will replace the entire contents of whatever #login is
[22:04:28] <DJ_UNA> and if load the overall #login it double layers
[22:04:40] <coldhead> weird
[22:05:12] <coldhead> you usually just say $('#thing-to-replace').load('url #thing-to-replace')
[22:05:16] <coldhead> which replaces just one thing
[22:07:37] <DJ_UNA> coldhead just made a div containing the twos -.- worked
[22:08:06] <coldhead> oh
[22:08:09] <coldhead> well great work then!
[22:08:11] <coldhead> case closed!
[22:08:16] <coldhead> let's all go to the pub
[22:09:49] <dr0id> comin
[22:10:15] <nickdc> does anyone have good experience with the jquery ui slider ?
[22:10:29] <gf3> dicks
[22:11:19] <coldhead> UR dicks, gf3
[22:11:22] <coldhead> UR dicks
[22:11:58] <gf3> I DARE U TO EAT A BAG OF MY DICKS
[22:12:14] <gf3> also fix my linux
[22:12:18] <gf3> it doesn't work
[22:21:53] <dogarrhea2> well. instead of complaining about jquery ui draggable containment being broken, i'm just not going to use it
[22:21:59] <dogarrhea2> the end.
[22:24:48] <jeffmoss> anybody know why sortable needs to have a fixed height?  Trying to hack my way around this behavior
[22:44:31] <vereteran> is there any way to watch when element will be available on the page except setInterval?
