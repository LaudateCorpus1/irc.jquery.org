[02:11:07] <W0LF> taxonomy terms - https://www.drupal.org/node/990080
[02:11:14] <W0LF> but having trouble getting it to work
[02:11:52] <W0LF> i'm getting an error referencing the "once" part of the code? but i'm really new at js implementation so unsure what i could be doing wrong or missing
[02:12:03] <W0LF> i'm trying to implement on d8
[02:35:10] <Woet> W0LF: so are you going to ask an actual useful question?
[02:36:22] <Woet> W0LF: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro
[02:37:27] <W0LF> Woet : gosh, i do try... =]
[02:38:47] <W0LF> I have a site here - http://www.kobejet.com/locations with a taxonomy list in a view exposed filter. I'd like to make it collapsible, but have tried two solutions posted online and neither work immediately. I'm unfortunately not very well versed with js, thus bringing me here
[02:39:29] <Woet> W0LF: please start with a minimal test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[02:39:38] <W0LF> the two posts with solutions i've tried are here: https://www.drupal.org/node/990080 and https://worldofdrupal.blogspot.jp/2015/06/views-exposed-taxonomy-exposed-filter.html?showComment=1506682127061#c4679013290140177298
[02:40:39] <W0LF> Woet : it's a js implementation in a views bef filter so i'm not even sure how to begin testing that in a jsfiddle by itself
[02:40:55] <Woet> W0LF: then i'm not sure how you expect us to help
[02:41:52] <W0LF> would trying in a drupal channel be a better option instead of the general jquery channel?
[02:42:12] <W0LF> this isn't a drupal-oriented channel, or is it?
[02:42:32] <Woet> no, #jquery isn't drupal oriented, it's jquery oriented
[02:43:22] <W0LF> alright, thank you
[02:43:31] <Woet> no worries
[03:14:23] <W0LF> the difference between .js and .min.js files is simply that the .min.js files have had all developer friendly spaces and indentation removed, correct? would misnaming a non min file .min.js file possibly cause it not to work?
[03:21:34] <pavonia> No
[03:23:05] <hendry> Hopefully someone can help me transform some HTML to JSON https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46510144/parsing-html-form-to-json
[10:23:19] <samsamek> is there a method that returns a given integer but cuts it off to a max value?
[10:23:42] <samsamek> lets say max value is 400. You give the method 300 and it returns 300. If you give it 500 though it returns the 400 (max)
[10:24:10] <samsamek> ah hell why dont I just write a function
[11:36:09] <W0LF> Anyone know why this piece of code might not be working? the first line works, but then the second line doesn't add the c
[11:36:21] <W0LF> class like I expect it to
[11:36:22] <W0LF> $(document).ready(function(){
[11:36:22] <W0LF> $('#block-views-block-background-block-2').addClass('show');
[11:36:22] <W0LF> $('#block-languageswitcher-2').addClass('show');
[11:36:22] <W0LF> });
[11:36:58] <W0LF> i'm trying to get it working on this site for the two language flags next to the main logo...
[11:37:37] <W0LF> but for some reason the "show" class isn't added to "block-languageswitcher-2", only the background one

[12:46:17] <W0LF> i have some minimal code i'm trying to troubleshoot here - https://jsfiddle.net/8fj1s0yc/1/, but can't figure out why it won't show the basic problem
[12:51:37] <Sayona> Hello people, is a way to add a variable where is XXX ?  $('.datacrypted-XXX}').replaceWith(view);
[12:55:03] <Sayona>  var entity_id_decrypt = '.decrypt-' + $(this).data('entity');
[12:55:10] <Sayona>  $(entity_id_decrypt).replaceWith(view);
[13:05:48] <W0LF> my fade in js here www.kobejet.com isn't working as intended...instead of fading in the bg after document.ready, it's fading it in on top of everything else before it recognizes the z-index: -100. any ideas?
[14:37:15] <randymarsh9> hey guys
[14:37:31] <randymarsh9> is there a 'cleaner' way to write this code?
[14:37:52] <randymarsh9> https://jsfiddle.net/LvqLnf19/
[14:38:18] <W0LF> trying to apply a js fade in here - kobejet.com, but it fades in above the other content...even though a negative z-index is applied. any ideas?
[14:38:58] <randymarsh9> basically i don't want anything to happen to the div until the mouse leaves the box, so the first function call is empty.
[14:39:18] <randymarsh9> it works as i want it to but seems odd having an empty first function
[14:39:35] <randymarsh9> is that okay or is there another way i should write this?
[15:22:40] <shoky> randymarsh9: mouseleave event. and css transitions are definitely cleaner/better than jquery animations ;p
[16:39:12] <waveprop> why does my eval statement fail here? i'm getting the error 'SyntaxError: invalid switch statement' ==> http://termbin.com/7wu4
[16:40:55] <waveprop> i'm trying to dynamically build a switch statement by iterating over an array of integers. 1. is this wrong 2. is there another (perhaps jquery) way to accomplish the same thing iteratively, so i dont have a massive switchcase
[17:36:04] <waveprop> it looks like a working alternative is to use key-value pairs and a lookup
[21:54:54] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm injecting markup into my document like this: https://hastebin.com/iralixopen.lisp
[21:55:24] <bobdobbs> The injection works. But the lines I inject are wrapped in double-quotes
[21:55:56] <bobdobbs> so, I want to inject something like this before a line: <div class="footer-row">
[21:56:46] <bobdobbs> But in the document I get this: (including the quote marks) "<div class="footer-row">"
