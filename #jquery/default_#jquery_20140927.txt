[04:49:14] <pushpa> Hi, been looking all over the web on how to create a live feed, I am convinced JQuery should be able to handle this however I have not figured it out yet. Exampple of the result I am looking for you can observe in the lower left corner of this website:  https://www.casumo.com/    I assume they are using Node.js to push their live data, however I just need to push data from a html file, however I want the same appearance
[04:50:15] <pushpa> I am basicly looking for a simple way to accomplish the same appearance as that feed
[05:09:06] <pushpa> think i found a good solution http://risq.github.io/jquery-advanced-news-ticker/index.html
[06:06:13] <x-finite> Hello, I have made my first custom theme but photo galleries, lightbox etc do not seem to run in it. They appear to be running normally when i load other themes. I have tried playing around with functions.php file but doesn't seems to work. It's quiet a basic theme, with just four files (page.css,index.php,functions.php and style.css)

[07:57:39] <hashworks> Is this behaviour intended? http://jsfiddle.net/ax7Lw769/
[07:58:02] <hashworks> Setting the selected attribute in jQuery always results in it being set to "selected"
[08:04:29] <shoky> hashworks: i think it's for backwards compatibility, because before 1.6 .attr was used to set properties like "selected" as well as attributes. anyways you shouldn't use "selected" for custom data
[08:04:30] <decx> you cant create custom elements just yet, also use .prop() instead of attr(), also selected is either true or false
[08:04:55] <hashworks> I'm using polymer, which uses custom html elements
[08:05:33] <hashworks> So I need to set selected differently. I'm using pure JS now, works fine
[08:05:53] <s5fs> Hello friends! We are aware the jQuery sites are down and are busily working to restore service. Sorry for the interruption.
[08:05:55] <shoky> why use "selected"? it already has its uses
[08:06:18] <shoky> thanks s5fs
[08:06:51] <hashworks> F.e. there is a paper-tabs element which contains paper-tab elements. The selected-attr in paper-tabs tells polymer which one to underline
[08:09:08] <shoky> i see
[08:43:52] <nikku> Hello All :)
[08:45:08] <nikku> I want to develop an one page app with 1096 divs... out of these divs, 24 will be shown on page, based on selection....is jquery the right framework to use for this task?
[08:45:15] <nikku> or should I use something else?
[08:46:58] <davlefou> hi,
[08:47:11] <nikku> hello
[08:48:05] <davlefou> i made that http://pastebin.com/0kWvaiVZ but the if don't work. it seems no data in newObject.etat.
[08:54:52] <gnarf> nikku: jQuery isn't nessecarily a framework, but it should be up to that task.  though looping over 1000+ dom elements in any library/framework could very easily perform badly
[08:54:58] <gnarf> gotta be careful how you do it
[08:55:23] <gnarf> even in raw JS you can very easily shoot yourself in the foot
[08:57:35] <nikku> gnarf: I was thinking the same.. Should I think of using some database to store the divs content?
[08:58:11] <nikku> or is it possible to store in json files... and then bring those files?
[08:58:21] <hashworks>  /part
[08:58:27] <hashworks> Hups.
[08:58:38] <gnarf> it's possible, but creating dom in a loop is also a perf nightmare
[08:58:48] <gnarf> so - any way you do it, just be careful, and test
[08:59:02] <gnarf> don't do a lot of complex logic in loops over 1000 items
[08:59:04] <gnarf> you should be fine
[08:59:05] <gnarf> also
[08:59:40] <nikku> gnarf: ok. Thanks :) If you were to do it, how would you do it?
[08:59:44] <gnarf> treat css/style props as "read only" or "write only" in blocks - it will stop the browser from having to "force reflow" which it needs to do when you try to read certain style properties after setting others
[09:00:00] <gnarf> nikku: i'd probably not box myself into a situation like that - :)
[09:00:24] <gnarf> nikku: what are some example conditions that figure out which boxes are displayed?
[09:00:25] <nikku> I thought its a trivial situation
[09:00:44] <nikku> something like choosing 24 entries from 1000+ entries
[09:01:03] <nikku> The user selects all the options
[09:01:47] <nikku> So, it should be simple as.. 1. Hide all divs. 2. Display all the divs that have been selected
[09:02:11] <gnarf> how do they select them?
[09:02:58] <nikku> multiple select
[09:03:10] <nikku> I am thinking of using chosen http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[09:03:55] <gnarf> as long as you have simple selectors to determine what to show and hide, etc
[09:05:40] <gnarf> seems like it would be pretty easy to have a <select multiple><option value="id-of-element">element to show</option></select> and do something like var selectedIds = $("select").val(); $("div.toggling").each(function() { var div = $(this); if (selectedIds.indexOf(div.id) === -1) { div.hide(); } else { div.show(); });
[09:06:50] <nikku> gnarf: I will try it and let you know. Thanks :)
[09:43:40] <synapt> Anyone here ever use the FriendURL plugin?

[09:45:08] <synapt> lol, well wasn't jQuery specifically related so wasn't sure, was mostly looking to privmsg if there were.  Simple question though is if anyone has managed to get it working with two fields at once as it seems broken in doing so (either that or it's a jQuery bug, still trying to figure it out)

[11:59:31] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/pd2wut5c/ Why does (15000-12000)/(15000+12000) come out as 0.000001999984000127999 and not 0.11111111 or so?  That math is just wrong.
[12:01:36] <sadtaco> Like it's not even close.
[12:13:37] <YammYcoding> guys that's wrong somewhere? $.get( '.datepicker-days .table-condensed > tbody:last', function() {  	$(this).append('<tr><td>foo</td></tr>');  } );
[12:13:56] <YammYcoding> it enter the function but do nothing
[12:19:20] <shoky> $.get is for ajax..
[12:19:26] <YammYcoding> oh
[12:19:38] <YammYcoding> but the function enter for some reason
[12:19:41] <YammYcoding> but do nothing
[12:19:52] <YammYcoding> how i can acomplish the task then?
[12:19:57] <shoky> what task
[12:20:13] <YammYcoding> i want to add an extra tr to the datetimepiker table
[12:20:20] <decx> $( '.datepicker-days .table-condensed > tbody:last').append('<tr><td>foo</td></tr>');
[12:20:33] <YammYcoding> tried that decx, didn't do anything either
[12:20:40] <YammYcoding> http://jsfiddle.net/YammYcoding/ea401t7z/
[12:21:54] <decx> maybe identifying the actual task would be benefitial
[12:22:07] <YammYcoding> hm?
[12:22:18] <decx> cial
[12:22:35] <YammYcoding> =(
[12:23:24] <Mag-neto> here is the code
[12:23:26] <Mag-neto> http://jsfiddle.net/5hugvr0b/1/
[12:23:26] <shoky> .datepicker-days  isn't inside #datetimepicker1
[12:23:26] <decx> well you want some extra info in your datepicker table
[12:23:32] <Mag-neto> plz take a look
[12:23:52] <Mag-neto> I was searching the whole day and try to figured out
[12:23:58] <Mag-neto> but can't
[12:24:27] <YammYcoding> hmm it isn't? but it's a child of it, not?
[12:25:42] <YammYcoding> at html it has <div class="datepicker"> <div class="datepicker-days"> ... <table class="table-condensed>
[12:25:43] <Mag-neto> or should i use another function instead of .load()
[12:26:53] <shoky> YammYcoding: no it is not a child of #datetimepicker1
[12:29:49] <YammYcoding> hm then it's harder than i thought
[12:30:12] <MalekAlrwily> Hi

[12:36:47] <YammYcoding> also not   var dp = $( '.datepicker .datepicker-days .table-condensed > tbody:last' ).find();
[12:39:16] <shoky> the bootstrap plugin overwrites it anyway
[13:02:07] <soee_> how can i cout not empty lines in textarea
[13:04:37] <YammYcoding> the datepicker one? then is there any workaround for it?

[16:02:50] <GR33NM4CH1N3> Hi all
[16:03:12] <GR33NM4CH1N3> Would anyone be able to help me figure out how to turn off the audio (pause/play/mute) controls on this simple jQuery slider?
[16:03:13] <GR33NM4CH1N3> https://github.com/varunnaik/A-Slider/blob/master/aslider.js
[16:03:24] <GR33NM4CH1N3> main github page: https://github.com/varunnaik/A-Slider
[16:03:51] <GR33NM4CH1N3> In theory, this should work (I think), but it does not:
[16:03:53] <GR33NM4CH1N3> <div class="aslider data-hide-controls">
[16:03:53] <GR33NM4CH1N3>   <div class="aslide" data-duration="4">
[16:03:54] <GR33NM4CH1N3>       <img src="images/smallslider/photoSignFinger.jpg" alt="an image" />
[16:03:55] <GR33NM4CH1N3>       <!-- <p>this can come with text</p> -->
[16:03:57] <GR33NM4CH1N3>   </div>
[16:03:59] <GR33NM4CH1N3> </div>
[16:06:20] <lethjakman> is there an easy way to scroll a box so that a div is visible?
[16:08:54] <YammYcoding> shoky, about that datepicker table you think there is no workaround?
[16:20:32] <definity> Any one know why the fadeIn() method is not working? http://pastie.org/9600178
[16:22:41] <GR33NM4CH1N3> woohoo I figured it out
[16:22:59] <GR33NM4CH1N3> just took the boilerplate and used it.. and it worked, even tho my code was apparently identical
[16:23:00] <GR33NM4CH1N3> oh well
