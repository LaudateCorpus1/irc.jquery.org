[03:10:11] <fgrsgsdfg> can you make the floating monkey in "Example 2" of http://interactions.webflow.com/#examples with jquery?
[03:22:50] <guessx> fgr... you can
[04:16:46] <Pazician> Hello everyone. Why does not work? http://pastebin.com/ugKkj7vq HTML: http://pastebin.com/SAU1eWki
[04:21:34] <guessx> Pazician: what are you trying to do?
[04:22:40] <Pazician> guessx: Replace 1,2,3,4,5 to start
[04:22:45] <Pazician> Stars
[04:23:46] <guessx> well your overwriting the whole entry
[04:23:51] <guessx> so no need to replace
[04:24:12] <Pazician> guessx: I'm not really following here, what you mean?
[04:25:26] <guessx> well everything in your span is being removed as your overwriting it
[04:25:55] <Pazician> guessx: No, not really - it's all there, like nothing happened... No idea why tho
[04:27:18] <guessx> thats the way the code reads to me
[04:27:45] <guessx> $('.stars').html('<i class="fa fa-star"></i>');
[04:27:57] <guessx> no point doing newText
[04:29:16] <Pazician> guessx: I just tried the one you suggested and nothing at all happened, the numbers are still there and nothing has been added to the HTML...?
[04:30:05] <guessx> are you trying to overwrite the whole thing, or change each href number to a star?
[04:31:19] <Pazician> guessx: I'm trying in the front-end to show Font-Awesome stars and not the numbers, it still has to add the rating in the db
[04:39:19] <guessx> Pazician: $('.stars > span > a').each(function(){$(this).html('<i class="fa fa-star"></i>');}) each number replaced with a star?
[04:41:15] <Pazician> guessx: Still numbers appearing and nothing has been added to the HTML :/
[04:42:04] <guessx> Pazician: comment out your 3 lines, and is jQuery loaded?
[04:43:29] <Pazician> guessx: The console.log() doesn't run, but outside it's running http://pastebin.com/7HpUJ9GL
[04:44:07] <Pazician> So it has to be something wrong with the function or similar
[04:46:50] <eplo22> hi
[04:47:02] <guessx> Pazician, is jQuery loaded?
[04:49:26] <guessx> https://jsfiddle.net/n5vwrLv1/ - added a delay in so you could see the text before it disappears, if you inspect the results tab it did what i told it to do
[04:50:52] <Pazician> guessx: Yes, you're right! But I don't understand what's wrong with mine tho
[05:02:42] <decx> if you only use html you dont need each, it has its own
[05:15:16] <Pazician> decx: Alright, thank you. The thing is it's not working alone, it's working fine inside the setTimeout function w/o it's not working at all
[05:18:39] <decx> put it in a domready
[05:20:25] <Pazician> decx: It's already in a domready
[05:21:22] <decx> then check your console. putting it in a timeout is wrong
[05:22:27] <no_gravity> Whats the jquery way to smoothly scoll to the bottom of the page?
[05:25:30] <Pazician> decx: There's no errors in the console
[05:25:38] <Pazician> It's all clean
[06:41:59] <sweet2k4> is it wrong to iclude jquery in the top of the document?
[06:42:20] <sweet2k4> ive seen many ppl say that you should include before the closing body tag
[06:42:56] <sweet2k4> but is that only for script that accualy "interact" with the website

[07:17:44] <Nialcen> Hello

[07:44:16] <Qiller> hi friends, i have: <div id="test" onclick="123">X</div>, <div id="test" onclick="456">X</div>... can i hide by onclick value? like onclick="789"? all div have same id.
[07:48:51] <Qiller> find by attr and hide,
[07:51:07] <CapnKlutch> Qiller, not with the same id but with the same class you can
[07:51:49] <Qiller> CapnKlutch: cant i find by attr onclick value? like $('[onclick="789"]').hide();
[07:52:51] <ThePendulum> Has anyone worked with DataTables extensively before? I'm having issues reinitializing a DataTables generated table after it has initialized empty
[07:53:04] <ThePendulum> I was wondering how to safely initialize a DT table when there potentially is no data
[07:54:43] <Qiller> CapnKlutch: its work!!! =D using attr tag.
[07:54:59] <tash> I'm using window.open() for something, and it opens a window in a new tab.  Is there a way to programmatically force that to be a pop up in a new window?  Or is that all up to the browser?
[07:56:26] <CapnKlutch> Qiller, great
[07:57:01] <CapnKlutch> Can someone help me please get this to work properly? - http://jsfiddle.net/m6d7ze0f/
[07:57:08] <ThePendulum> tash: That works for me if I set the option 'resizable'
[07:57:09] <CapnKlutch> It's not supposed to replace the letters in the HTML only the text
[07:57:14] <ThePendulum> It's quite annoying though, I wouldn't recommend it
[07:57:23] <CapnKlutch> It was working before I made it case insensitive
[07:57:31] <ThePendulum> tash: window.open('http://www.google.com/', 'Google', 'resizable')
[08:00:19] <tash> ThePendulum, will give it a try now
[08:02:41] <tash> strange, still opens in a new tab for me in IE
[08:02:48] <tash> will see if it does the same thing in FF
[08:03:29] <tash> actually in FF it just takes place of my current window, even worse
[08:03:29] <ThePendulum> Chrome blocks it, lol

[15:18:56] <JQdotpass> $("#JQuery").awesome("hello");
[15:19:27] <JQdotpass> Is there anyone there?
[15:19:34] <JQdotpass> im so lonely:(
[15:24:14] <docmur___> I have a drop down that selects between multiple <div>'s but when the div changes my drop down no longer seem to trigger the change(), this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/e2aoogdp/3/  What I'm i do wrong?, I added background color to make it easier to track http://jsfiddle.net/e2aoogdp/8/
[15:34:51] <FilipNortic> docmur___: don't know if it's the error but you've used the id modeselect for multible elements
[15:51:19] <FilipNortic> docmur___: it was the cause of the error. jQuery assumes that there will be only one element with that id (since id should be unique). so it only puts the change event on the first one
[16:08:55] <Hilton> Struggling to understand some event code that may not be working. There is a line: self.bind('splitter.resize', ...), where self is defined as $.extend(this,...). What is splitter.resize supposed to be? Is that a typo? All the other events have the opposite - mouseup.splitter, etc.
[16:10:20] <Hilton> Or is that simply a custom event name?
[16:10:24] <pcfreak30> I Have an issue. How can I pick out elements of stray text NOT inside a tag in the dom?
[16:11:06] <pcfreak30> without having to use html() and string manipulation
[16:29:27] <JQdotpass> is jQuery events hard to learn?
[16:31:38] <Hilton> JQdotpass: Easy to learn, hard to master, like most things. :)
[16:33:25] <JQdotpass> jQuery events, today hurt me
[16:35:30] <docmur___> Oh okaa
[16:35:35] <JQdotpass> Hilton: jQuery Event Methods do I need to learn it all?
[16:36:05] <FilipNortic> Well atleast the dubugger in most browsers lets you trace the events from trigger to endpoint
[16:36:12] <docmur___> That's really stupid but no problem
[16:36:29] <Hilton> Learn what you need to accomplish what you need to do. Start with .on(), it will handle most of your use cases.
[16:37:05] <FilipNortic> docmur___: not sutpid if you have a huge page unique id look up can save time
[16:37:22] <FilipNortic> and use a class if there is many
[16:37:35] <docmur___> No it's still stupid but it's okay, I'll just use different ID's
[16:38:09] <FilipNortic> docmur___: use the class and then $(this) for the value
[16:38:43] <JQdotpass> Hilton, i pass .on() method,  later .on(), I'm confused
[16:39:53] <JQdotpass> firsts lessons easy to understand. $("div").click(funtion(){ etc..
[16:41:22] <FilipNortic> on() is a bit special since it handles both ordinary and deffered events now days
[16:41:34] <JQdotpass> but I will not give up.
[16:41:42] <JQdotpass> i must learn it.
[16:44:30] <JQdotpass> i love jquery
[17:36:05] <paulong_> someone online?
[17:40:12] <JQdotpass> hey,

[18:03:03] <ISmithers> What do people use to do button animations like this http://www.addthis.com/ (hover over "Brands & Agencies")
[18:03:36] <ISmithers> At the moment I am using jquery ui to toggle a class and then in css assigning different styles. Which jquery ui then smoothly interpolates between.
[18:03:53] <ISmithers> However that site I don't see anything changing in the markup on hover, so they must be doing it via another method - which is what I am curious about.
[18:13:16] <SirLagz> ISmithers: CSS probably
[18:13:48] <StevenD> ISmithers, .div:hover {background-color:#ddd; }
[18:14:03] <StevenD> All you need is css no jquery required
[18:18:15] <ISmithers> Yeah just seeing that now. I've never used that stuff before. Is that pretty solid in terms of backwards compatibility?
[18:18:42] <StevenD> CSS Oh yes
[18:18:58] <ISmithers> Its actually using some animated rules in css. Transitions etc.
[18:19:28] <StevenD> ISmithers, Yep
[18:20:03] <ISmithers> Yeah I understand regular CSS is fine, but looking at for example 'transition' it looks like its only IE11
[18:20:06] <ISmithers> http://caniuse.com/#search=transition
[18:20:57] <StevenD> ISmithers,  I use transition in firefox and chrome :p
[18:21:23] <StevenD> Ther are probably extra rules I use to make it work on all browsers but its all CSS at the end
[18:22:53] <ISmithers> I have IE11 here, I'm wondering what the AddThis site looks like on other versions. Might need to fire up browserstack.
[18:23:12] <ISmithers> Interesting though. I think atm jquery ui might offer more stability.
[18:30:38] <dot_> hello, I am trying to call onclick function, but it says Uncaught TypeError: social is not a function eventough its in document ready, how is it possible ?
[18:31:15] <ISmithers> Showcode
[18:39:07] <dot_> ISmithers: http://pastebin.com/nc2VCLe2
[18:39:24] <dot_> nothing happens
[18:40:40] <dot_> ISmithers: also html part
[18:40:41] <dot_> http://pastebin.com/jRSpmh6S
[18:42:05] <ISmithers> Your error is 'social is a not a function' dot_?
[18:42:35] <dot_> i changed a code meanwhile
[18:42:36] <dot_> one second
[18:43:08] <ISmithers> I think you have an extra } there, hard to tell with the indenting.
[18:43:13] <dot_> yep
[18:43:16] <dot_> i fixed this part
[18:43:18] <dot_> but still popup
[18:43:21] <dot_> doesnt fire
[18:43:24] <ISmithers> Any error?
[18:43:35] <dot_> noup
[18:43:37] <dot_> that is strange
[18:43:52] <dot_> when I click on button nothing happens
[18:43:54] <dot_> no error
[18:44:39] <ISmithers> OK so the jquery is valid now. Something else is amiss.
[18:45:33] <ISmithers> Is the js being run on document ready?
[18:45:33] <dot_> yep
[18:45:41] <dot_> noup
[18:45:52] <ISmithers> Which is it lol?
[18:46:15] <ISmithers> Put some console.logs in to make sure the code is getting run, additionally step through the code after loading the page so that you can see where the execution gets to.
[18:46:50] <dot_> jep
[18:48:58] <SemiNus> hi

[21:34:55] <greatdex> hi
[21:35:02] <greatdex> I loaded jquery 1.10.1
[21:35:03] <krambal> how did you do that
[21:35:11] <krambal> hi greatdex
[21:35:14] <greatdex> but bootstarp says it requires greater than 1.9.3
[21:35:28] <greatdex> so i checked in console using "$.fn.jquery"
[21:35:33] <greatdex> then returned 1.8.3
[21:35:39] <greatdex> how on earth?
[21:35:54] <krambal> is it jquery.min.js ?
[21:35:56] <greatdex> yep
[21:36:09] <krambal> are you loading it locally or from a link
[21:36:25] <greatdex> local
[21:36:36] <krambal> redownload 1.10.1 lol
[21:36:42] <greatdex> lol...
[21:36:51] <greatdex> what do you think is the culprit
[21:36:53] <greatdex> ?
[21:36:58] <guessx> krambal: https://jsfiddle.net/hLm20g7y/
[21:39:45] <greatdex> connectino lost
[21:39:49] <greatdex> krambal
[21:39:53] <greatdex> did you tell me something
[21:39:54] <greatdex> '?
[21:40:03] <krambal> oh no i didn;t
[21:40:15] <krambal> i think you have the wrong version
[21:42:29] <greatdex> ok thank u
[21:42:42] <krambal> guessx
[21:43:01] <krambal> i am not able to get that to work
[21:43:12] <krambal> its sayig that the function line is not working
[21:54:37] <krambal> guessx its saying that the functino is not a function
[21:56:12] <guessx> krambal: https://jsfiddle.net/hkgLy0b2/
[21:57:41] <krambal> ok the fade is working but the audio isn't
[21:58:18] <krambal> that may be because the soundmanager is commented out
[21:59:16] <krambal> ok thats working guessx
[21:59:30] <krambal> but the audio file is playing after the word is gone
[21:59:44] <krambal> because its waitning until the delay is over and is fading out
[22:01:36] <krambal> lol and i broke it
[22:09:36] <krambal> is there a way to play the audio file before you start the fadeIn
[22:11:58] <guessx> krambal, move it all around http://jsfiddle.net/nc96mtar/ - that fades it in, plays it, then fades it out (pending length of file still playing it)
[22:14:41] <krambal> LOL IT WORKS!!
[22:15:02] <krambal> now all i have to do is have it do it 3 times in a random order and i will be done
[22:15:33] <krambal> as you can see i am doing it piece by piece
[22:19:13] <guessx> randomize the number, between 0 and the ids length
[22:23:07] <krambal> let me google that
[22:23:34] <krambal> i need to randomize it and put the word displayed in different areas
[22:25:03] <pineapple_> hi all
[22:26:43] <krambal> var randomnumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*11) is only doing 1 random number do i need to remake the array ?
[22:27:43] <krambal> hi pinapple
[22:36:15] <guessx> krambal:http://jsfiddle.net/rgyrz7nr/
[22:36:53] <Kamuela> is node 4 out today?
[22:39:38] <krambal> guessx is there a way to make it not repeat a number ?
[22:40:35] <guessx> sure add it into another array then add a for loop to check against it
[22:40:46] <guessx> im sure you'll cope with that
[22:41:54] <krambal> what do you mean add into another array
[22:46:46] <guessx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19351759/javascript-random-number-out-of-5-no-repeat-until-all-have-been-used
[22:50:33] <pineapple_> what browser versions are supported by jQuery UI? (on Android and iOS)
[22:51:21] <pineapple_> Didn't find any info here http://jqueryui.com/browser-support/
[22:53:44] <krambal> http://jsfiddle.net/nc96mtar/4/
[22:59:21] <krambal> guessx i got that to work thank you
[22:59:43] <krambal> now i am trying to add a repeat functions so it will run that function 3 times
[22:59:59] <krambal>  thats is what is in the js fiddle i put up
[23:00:47] <krambal> http://jsfiddle.net/nc96mtar/6/
[23:02:58] <guessx> are you running it 3x or 10?
[23:04:46] <guessx> http://pastebin.com/k39Xqiv5
[23:06:28] <krambal> i am running the 10 words 3 times
[23:08:47] <krambal> i am trying to run all 10 divs 3 times each
[23:12:22] <krambal> oh i just changed the if count
[23:12:36] <krambal> to 30
[23:12:42] <krambal> and now it will do it 30 times
[23:12:51] <krambal> but i dont know if it will do all word 3 times or not
[23:18:07] <j75> How can I get have certain elements fadeIn after getting results of post? for example I put the results of post request into a div how do I have certain items fade in?
[23:21:07] <guessx> Krambal:http://jsfiddle.net/eLvqybnf/
[23:21:49] <guessx> j75, got an example/got snippet
[23:24:15] <j75> guessx http://pastebin.com/98Yc3BBR
[23:28:32] <Cork> j75: you would have to convert data to a dom tree and then hide the elements you want to animate
[23:28:42] <Cork> j75: and then trigger the effect you want on those elements
[23:30:02] <j75> Thanks Cork! this is helpful
[23:30:54] <j75> would I trigger the effect inside my post function ?
[23:31:01] <Cork> yes
[23:32:19] <krambal> http://pastebin.com/TQ0xu1Lk
[23:32:29] <krambal> guessx this is the last thing i am trying to do
[23:32:34] <krambal> thank you so much for the help
[23:33:43] <krambal> trying to add that function to move the divs around the screen
[23:33:49] <krambal> before its shown
[23:34:07] <krambal> http://jsfiddle.net/3Z7HE/3/
[23:34:14] <krambal> That is where i got it from
[23:35:13] <j75> Cork any good links or resources for converting to dom tree ?
[23:35:33] <Cork> j75: var elms = $($.parseHTML(data));
[23:36:03] <Cork> j75: parsing to dom is what you're doing with .html(), you just need to store it in a variable first
[23:36:09] <Cork> so you can modify the content
[23:36:38] <guessx> krambal, replace randomnumber with someObj[SOMENUMBERHERE] as i put all the div ids into that array
[23:36:54] <j75> Cork: thanks a bunch!
[23:37:56] <krambal> OK
[23:38:13] <krambal> now i am getting an error saying moveDiv() is not a function
[23:41:51] <krambal> http://jsfiddle.net/J8Umt/4/
[23:42:07] <krambal> guessx i am getting moveDiv() is not a function
[23:45:37] <FilipNortic> krambal: what is $("#") ?
[23:46:02] <krambal> the sign to get the ID of the div
[23:46:26] <FilipNortic> seems like an element with an wmpty string for an id
[23:46:28] <krambal> like echo '#'. $variable ;
[23:47:55] <krambal> http://jsfiddle.net/J8Umt/5/
[23:48:03] <krambal> thats all of the code
[23:49:15] <j75> Cork: why $($.parseHTML(data)) instead of just $.parseHTML(data)
[23:49:46] <Cork> j75: cause $.parseHTML return a pure dom fragment, and you normally want jquery wrapping it to modify it
[23:50:08] <krambal> http://jsfiddle.net/J8Umt/6/
[23:50:21] <j75> so I just loop over the elements?
[23:50:41] <Cork> j75: you don't need to loop
[23:51:04] <Cork> elms.find('li').css({}) for example should do all you need
[23:51:19] <Cork> depending on how you plan on hiding them
[23:51:23] <guessx> https://jsfiddle.net/g6q6u9rk/
[23:51:25] <j75> elms.find('li').hide() ?
[23:51:45] <Cork> j75: .hide sets display: none, and css3 transition can't animate that
[23:52:52] <FilipNortic> krambal: $("#").someObject['key'] make no sense to me shoudn't it be $("#" + someObject['key'])?
[23:53:48] <guessx> Filip: it should be i changed it back
[23:53:50] <krambal> oh
[23:54:29] <krambal> guessx thats not moving the divs they are still displaying in the middle of the screen
[23:54:35] <krambal> that must be something in my css ?
[23:56:42] <strayArch> what is the best way to redraw a canvas when it's sibling tag is hovered
[23:58:02] <Cork> strayArch: there is basically only one, bind a hover event on the sibling
[23:58:17] <Cork> or mouseenter for jquery
[23:59:05] <krambal> is it showing you on the jsfiddle that it is moving ?
[23:59:21] <j75> Cork: it worked! thanks for your help. I also understand what is going on now
