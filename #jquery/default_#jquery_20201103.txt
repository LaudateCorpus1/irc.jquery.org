[09:02:36] <anli> Is there a way to get computed html?
[09:02:48] <anli> (dom manipulations and current values)
[09:27:56] <shoky_> anli: there's no such thing. but you can get html representing the current DOM state, e.g. with  $('#myelement').prop('outerHTML')     but it wont have data that is in runtime properties e.g. current values of inputs
