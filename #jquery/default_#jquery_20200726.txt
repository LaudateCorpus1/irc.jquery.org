[10:27:41] <pushpa> Hi... How do I correctly escape this?  .prepend("<tr><td><a href='" + data.result.url + "'>" + data.result.name + "</a></td>" + "<button id='" + data.result.id + "' onclick='"getStuff(elem)"'>Get Stuff</button></tr>")   ? :)

[11:23:29] <pushpa> Why do I receive: Uncaught ReferenceError: elem is not defined ... When I click the button?
[12:32:29] <shoky_> because elem is not defined ?
[12:43:16] <robertparkerx> Right now I have a script that is on the php page that will json_encode an array of values to use in ajax data variable. I'm trying to separate and use in a script. I tried storing the values in a hidden text input but it seems my ajax will throw mysql error so I think something is wrong with the value. When I print it in console.log() it is [112,113,114] for instance but I think it is a
[12:43:16] <robertparkerx> string.
[12:46:08] <robertparkerx> How can I store the array and grab it by selector to use in ajax?
[12:55:56] <robertparkerx> I got it
[12:56:05] <robertparkerx> JSON.parse()
