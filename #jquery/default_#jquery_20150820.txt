[00:37:13] <statvoid> anyone here using the jquery address plugin?
[00:37:31] <jak2000> i am not, but talk about it please i am interested
[00:40:44] <statvoid> I've got the 1.5 version which is failing on a call to browser.version
[00:41:00] <statvoid> ** $.browser.version
[00:42:34] <statvoid> this is the latest jquery address plugin, v1.5
[00:45:22] <Cork> statvoid: jquery 1.9 removed $.browser
[00:45:35] <Cork> so ya, that is intentional
[00:46:14] <Cork> ($.browser has been deprecated for a long time)
[02:27:05] <Shadow> Hi, If I click details the div opens and the arrow points down. If I click the same one again it closes and the arrow points across. This works correctly. But if I click a different one the arrow doesnt toggle back to across in the one that is open. Can anyone help with this please. http://jsfiddle.net/mdKU4/74/
[02:34:01] <hirsty> hey all, anybody use the tablesorter plugin?
[02:37:38] <Uhkis> yes
[02:43:19] <hirsty> what would i do in the case that one of my cells contains a dynamically generated <script> and then text?
[02:43:42] <hirsty> wanting to disregard the said script
[02:46:44] <`ULT> hi!
[02:46:45] <`ULT> what is better a reference to a extern script or including the script on the server?
[02:49:38] <hirsty> if its on a CDN it can reduce load on the server - would rec cdn.js
[02:50:23] <hirsty> @Uhkis what would cause this? http://prntscr.com/86ront
[02:51:00] <Uhkis> hirsty: what am i looking at?
[02:51:17] <hirsty> the debug output for tablesorter
[02:54:48] <Uhkis> no idea
[02:56:24] <hirsty> thought you used tablesorter :P oh well :D
[03:01:21] <Uhkis> my tablesorter doesn't have output like that
[03:09:49] <mukesh__> hi friends
[03:09:53] <mukesh__> i have an issue
[03:09:57] <Shadow> Hi, If I click details the div opens and the arrow points down. If I click the same one again it closes and the arrow points across. This works correctly. But if I click a different one the arrow doesnt toggle back to across in the one that is open. Can anyone help with this please. http://jsfiddle.net/mdKU4/74/
[03:10:07] <mukesh__> my jquery code only works when there is alert or debugger
[03:10:13] <mukesh__> or refresh the page
[03:10:15] <mukesh__> otherwise not
[03:10:22] <mukesh__> any idea why?
[03:10:49] <arc_> i'm not entirely sure how code can work if you refresh the page, but otherwise it doesn't
[03:10:53] <Cork> mukesh__: prob cause the code is racy
[03:11:02] <mukesh__> hey cork
[03:11:11] <mukesh__> what do you mean by racy?
[03:11:13] <Cork> make a jsfiddle with exactly the code you use
[03:11:25] <Cork> it runs too early so the alert is needed to delay it
[03:11:37] <mukesh__> you mean i have to put timeout
[03:11:42] <Cork> no
[03:11:46] <mukesh__> so
[03:11:53] <Cork> you need to show the code so we can tell what you're doing wrong
[03:12:17] <mukesh__> okay let me make jsfilddle
[03:12:20] <mukesh__> sec
[03:12:23] <Cork> one option is that you run code in the head without .ready
[03:12:30] <Cork> but there are many other
[03:13:15] <mukesh__> like
[03:13:25] <mukesh__> but then why it's work when refresh the page
[03:13:30] <mukesh__> it's not racy then
[03:13:31] <mukesh__> ?
[03:13:40] <arc_> just show us the code
[03:13:58] <mukesh__> okay give me some time
[03:15:55] <Shadow> can anyone help with my question please
[03:30:14] <Axy> Hey all
[03:30:26] <Axy> how can I create reusable elements
[03:30:39] <Axy> for instane a message box --- it'll be the same box but the contents will change
[03:30:41] <Axy> Stuff like this
[04:10:52] <arup_r> Why the data is not being printed rather error is coming ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/186f270c0cf488489690
[04:11:29] <arup_r> error is ReferenceError
[04:14:00] <Cork> arup_r: bind a fail handler
[04:14:17] <Cork> your most likely having access problems with the data you send
[04:14:20] <arup_r> Cork: It seems scope issue
[04:14:28] <Cork> ah
[04:14:36] <Cork> ya, sorry missed that log at the end
[04:14:44] <Cork> arup_r: $.get is async
[04:15:01] <arup_r> ok
[04:15:11] <Cork> so you will run 1. var events; 2. $.get()... 3. console.log(events) 4. events = data
[04:15:13] <arup_r> what to do ?
[04:15:25] <Cork> you have to move console.log inside the callback
[04:15:51] <Cork> if you have to return it from the function use deferred return $.get();
[04:15:52] <arup_r> Cork: I need the data value outside .. I will pass it to other method
[04:16:00] <Cork> and then func().done(function(events) {})
[04:16:18] <Cork> arup_r: you can't access it syncronically outside
[04:16:29] <Cork> it isn't possible
[04:16:48] <Cork> well there are ways to do it, but it is deprecated and has a lot of bad effects
[04:17:16] <Uhkis> someone's talking about async: false
[04:17:29] <Cork> :)
[04:18:48] <arup_r> ok
[05:34:31] <tomatto> is there some event which listens to text change of input element?
[05:35:02] <taplar> input
[05:35:15] <taplar> and change
[05:35:29] <taplar> input fires without blur
[05:39:20] <Cork> and keydown if you want none visible inputs
[07:27:40] <Voyage_> hi
[07:27:46] <Voyage_> In this link http://themes.forgrafx.com/?theme=AVENDOR-HTML  the theme shows loading count of from 0% to 100%. What is causing that ? I want to remove this effect and load the page at once?
[07:32:50] <Cork> Voyage_: that is hard to say without ripping the site apart
[07:32:58] <Cork> some js lib somewhere most likely
[07:33:08] <Furandzs> hi, had already anybody this problem with jquery.tooltip? when use it with input field id-s, everything goes well, but if I put some negation to any field id-s or for example :not(textarea) in it slows down the browser (firefox) very much with 30% cpu usage, tried already to google it, but nothing found, is it a known bug or I missed something?
[07:39:22] <Cork> Furandzs: you should give it a simple selector
[07:39:35] <Cork> cause it has to do the check on every element as you focus/hover it
[07:39:45] <Cork> Furandzs: i would recommend using a class
[07:40:38] <Furandzs> i tried already with simple field ids also with same result
[07:41:44] <Furandzs> Cork: if you meant that with simple selector
[07:41:52] <Cork> you mean adding a long list of id's in the selector?
[07:42:31] <Cork> i mean with how jquery.tooltip is built it is meant to be bound on a parent and match a group of child elements
[07:42:42] <Cork> the best way to do that is with a class selector
[07:42:45] <Cork> not ids
[07:45:15] <Furandzs> I used this $( "input, button, :not(...id)" ) . tooltip(); for example in a form which has lots of (more than 40 fields) and I got that result what I explain above
[07:46:08] <Furandzs> I understand what you mean thanks for the help
[07:55:36] <ceramicskull> Hey Cork, we spoke about jQuery addMethod not to long ago, I have a couple more questions.
[07:55:40] <Cork> Furandzs: :not(...id) is the same as *:not(...id)
[07:55:52] <Cork> so you are selecting every element in the page except what is in the ()
[08:00:28] <ceramicskull> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4g05zep1/ is that correct?
[08:02:51] <Cork> ceramicskull: no, it's <name of function>: true
[08:03:05] <ceramicskull> Ah
[08:03:20] <ceramicskull> Kk cool,
[08:04:11] <tomatto> Cork: taplar: i need fired event when user ends up writing/editing text
[08:04:27] <Cork> tomatto: that would be the input event
[08:06:07] <ceramicskull> Thanks Cork
[08:07:21] <tomatto> Cork: it looks like that event fires on every key
[08:07:36] <Cork> ya?
[08:07:40] <Cork> that is what you asked for
[08:08:18] <tomatto> Cork: not exactly, i need event which is fired when users ends editing, not on every key
[08:08:29] <Cork> there isn't one for that
[08:08:40] <Cork> there is change, but it fires when the field loses focus
[08:08:44] <Cork> if the content has changed
[08:16:11] <tomatto> Cork: only if content has changed? that sounds good
[08:50:45] <robertmaxrees> goooooood morning #jquery
[08:51:36] <taplar> yo
[08:51:55] <taplar> sorry, that was lazy of me.  kon'nichiwa
[08:52:03] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[08:57:55] <adv_> anyone has done deep linking in fancybox?
[08:58:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/STgGM/
[08:59:00] <robertmaxrees> this is probably related to that idea.
[09:04:31] <adv_> robertmaxrees: hm actually i want it to work with videos, not images
[09:04:41] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[09:04:48] <robertmaxrees> same basic concept at least.
[09:05:02] <adv_> and another problem is that it should change the url to include the hash, so that the user can copy and paste it
[09:05:22] <adv_> some kind of unique identifier
[09:09:27] <adv_> robertmaxrees: i find examples that work when the user includes the hash, not when he clicks from a link
[09:13:22] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle yo.
[09:13:49] <robertmaxrees> you just want to programatically open things on click and update the URL with a hash
[09:13:56] <robertmaxrees> then on pageload, read the hash and go to town.
[09:17:53] <adv_> robertmaxrees: can't even get the basic example working now :/ http://jsbin.com/kidotufadi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:18:33] <robertmaxrees> adv_ because it'll take a bit more than that.
[09:18:48] <robertmaxrees> read the docs and stuff.
[09:18:51] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic overall.
[09:19:48] <adv_> i have this example working, just tried to make a stripped version out of it
[09:20:00] <adv_> not sure what's wrong
[09:20:23] <robertmaxrees> start with the basics :)
[09:20:28] <robertmaxrees> tackle one problem at a time.
[09:24:07] <taplar> is $.isEmptyObject(variable) the same as $(this).length < 1 ?
[09:24:27] <robertmaxrees> no
[09:24:51] <robertmaxrees> $(this).length is for jquery objects - $.isEmptyObject() is detects for all enumerable properties.
[09:25:06] <robertmaxrees> also, no need to do $(this).length < 1 - 0 is falsy :)
[09:26:05] <taplar> so in a $.fn function which would be better?  i'm thinking i've seen just the length one before
[09:26:20] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[09:26:28] <taplar> i'm writing a little helper contains() method
[09:26:42] <robertmaxrees> there's already a .https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[09:27:14] <robertmaxrees> or just .find('someselector').length
[09:27:33] <taplar> is that just for descendents  or $.contains([1, 2], 2)?
[09:27:53] <robertmaxrees> the $.fn namespace is meant for jquery objects, not plain objects/arrays.
[09:28:46] <taplar> right i'm wanting to be able to do $([1, 2]).contains(1) or $({ a: 'b', c: 'd' }).contains('c')
[09:29:06] <robertmaxrees> $() is not meant to take plain objects.
[09:29:11] <robertmaxrees> it's meant for DOM objects.
[09:29:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure how else to phrase that.
[09:29:45] <taplar> k
[09:30:50] <adv_> robertmaxrees: read the docs .. http://jsbin.com/xuweyibexi/edit?html,js,output
[09:31:01] <adv_> am i missing something??
[09:40:58] <adv_> ?
[09:44:52] <robertmaxrees> i hate jsbin
[09:45:02] <robertmaxrees> and open your console.
[09:47:41] <adv_> hm
[09:47:46] <adv_> going to do a jsfiddle
[09:48:07] <robertmaxrees> what's your specific question?  "it doesn't work" isn't helpful.
[10:03:22] <bePolite> robertmaxrees:  Specific question == "It doesn't work as it should"
[10:04:12] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[10:04:20] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you expect.
[10:16:43] <mentoc> What does the second param do? $(".toggle_area",$("#foobar")).blah(); ??
[10:17:02] <robertmaxrees> that operates like .find() - $('#foobar').find('.toggle_area');
[10:17:22] <mentoc> search foobar for toggle_area?
[10:17:43] <robertmaxrees> see if .toggle_area exists as a descendent of #foobar
[10:18:06] <mentoc> everytime I've had an issue, you've been the one to resolve it in this channel
[10:18:10] <django_> if i have a class and in it i have divs with images inside..using jquer how i can access the imgs width
[10:18:33] <django_> all of them
[10:18:40] <robertmaxrees> django_ what are you doing with them?
[10:18:49] <django_> robertmaxrees: just trying to get their width
[10:19:16] <robertmaxrees> django_ you can get an array of widths.
[10:19:38] <django_> robertmaxrees: how do i get it
[10:19:40] <robertmaxrees> $('.parent').find('img').map(function() { return $(this).width() }).get()
[10:20:13] <robertmaxrees> django_ you have multiple images so they can ostensibly have different widths.
[10:20:28] <robertmaxrees> so that will get you an array of all widths.  not sure if that's really what you want.
[10:20:49] <django_> you have  a class that its children are images..how i get those imgs
[10:21:02] <robertmaxrees> $('.theClass').find('img');
[10:21:59] <django_> it returns array of imgs?
[10:22:06] <robertmaxrees> a jquery object of images.
[10:22:12] <webzen> hi
[10:22:37] <webzen> is it possible to add an id attribute to an element by name
[10:22:51] <robertmaxrees> webzen sure - select it by name and then edit the .prop() of it.
[10:23:12] <webzen> k, thanks robertmaxrees
[10:23:29] <robertmaxrees> though I'd just do that in your backend.
[10:23:39] <webzen> huh ?
[10:23:45] <robertmaxrees> add the ID in your backend.
[10:24:15] <webzen> line 2 creates line 5, trying to add id="token" http://laravel.io/bin/ok6v9#
[10:25:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:25:19] <robertmaxrees> what is {{ Form::open(array('action' => 'EmployeeTabController@store', 'role' => 'form', 'id'=>'frmEmp')) }} ?
[10:25:29] <mentoc> looks like php
[10:25:35] <webzen> that works $('[name=_token]').prop('id','token');
[10:25:48] <webzen> yeah that was laravel php that created the token
[10:25:52] <webzen> thanks, this will be fine
[10:25:55] <webzen> appreciate it
[10:25:59] <robertmaxrees> webzen then use your backend to add the id.
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> don't add ids using jquery :)
[10:26:16] <webzen> i don't know how since laravel created it
[10:26:24] <webzen> it's like voodoo
[10:26:36] <robertmaxrees> then read laravel's documentation :D
[10:26:45] <webzen> yeah, i'll pass
[10:26:50] <webzen> been there
[10:26:52] <webzen> many times
[10:26:58] <robertmaxrees> that's the right way to do it.
[10:27:05] <webzen> their idea of read the documentation is to read all their source code
[10:27:21] <webzen> it may be right but if nobody knows how it's doesn't actually help
[10:27:32] <robertmaxrees> so you're going to make the situation worse? ;)
[10:27:40] <webzen> it is what it is
[10:27:46] <webzen> when you know better, you do better
[10:27:53] <robertmaxrees> right - you know better, so do it :D
[10:28:01] <webzen> you make no sense
[10:28:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that you know the right way would be to add the ID via your backend, but you're choosing not to.
[10:28:37] <webzen> nobody can tell me how to add the id in line 2 http://laravel.io/bin/ok6v9#
[10:28:52] <webzen> i'm happy to add it in the backend but no one knows how
[10:29:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/19802521/923919
[10:29:20] <robertmaxrees> (i don't know PHP but I'm guessing it's something like that.
[10:29:33] <webzen> it already has an id in there
[10:29:37] <webzen> but it's a form idea
[10:30:27] <robertmaxrees> just sayin' :)
[10:30:40] <webzen> i hear you, thanks
[10:31:12] <webzen> it's chaos here
[10:31:22] <robertmaxrees> we went through a gross period of that kind of stuff.
[10:31:37] <xdo> Hello Do you know how to check if an object is empty or Not ?
[10:31:49] <xdo> Object {e: "e"}
[10:31:58] <robertmaxrees> xdo define "empty"
[10:32:35] <xdo> ??? https://api.jquery.com/empty/ ?
[10:32:51] <robertmaxrees> Description: Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM.
[10:33:05] <robertmaxrees> what browsers do you need to support?
[10:33:48] <robertmaxrees> because you could do Object.keys(myObject).length
[10:34:02] <xdo> hmm I try to check if my object is empty or not, because when a user enters a given , I hydrate my object with data from the users
[10:34:17] <robertmaxrees> you mean array?
[10:34:28] <xdo> Object {e: "e"}
[10:34:33] <xdo> array ?
[10:35:09] <robertmaxrees> show me an actual example of your data :)
[10:35:15] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you really want an array.
[10:35:16] <xdo> it's not like that var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
[10:35:49] <robertmaxrees> so it's a list of key/value pairs - if you don't need IE8, Object.keys(myObject).length
[10:35:55] <robertmaxrees> that'll to what you want.
[10:36:10] <robertmaxrees> *do
[10:36:22] <xdo> Object {e: "e", username: "test"}
[10:36:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to explain it - i've given you an example.
[10:37:16] <xdo> My name is object table
[10:37:22] <xdo> table.keys.length ?
[10:37:25] <robertmaxrees> no/.
[10:37:31] <vacho> domain.com/meetings/events/1 ...how can I with jquery get the digit 1 ?
[10:37:57] <robertmaxrees> xdo http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x42aws48/
[10:38:07] <robertmaxrees> Object.keys(putYourObjectHere).length
[10:38:12] <taplar> vacho: from the url bar?
[10:38:17] <robertmaxrees> vacho you don't.
[10:38:26] <robertmaxrees> vacho you use vanilla js for that.
[10:38:34] <vacho> robertmaxrees: ok let me check
[10:38:48] <robertmaxrees> vacho window.location.pathname
[10:38:56] <robertmaxrees> could split that and then grab the last index.
[10:39:20] <robertmaxrees> window.location.pathname.split[window.location.pathname.length - 1];
[10:39:45] <vacho> robertmaxrees: that gave me undefined
[10:40:10] <robertmaxrees> go into your console and type window.location.pathname
[10:40:19] <xdo> thank you robertmaxrees
[10:40:20] <taplar> can the number be > 9?  might want to split on '/'
[10:40:24] <robertmaxrees> woops - window.location.pathname.split('/')[window.location.pathname.length - 1];
[10:40:43] <vacho> "/meetings/calendar/1"
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> fff  window.location.pathname.split('/')[ window.location.pathname.split('/').length - 1];
[10:40:59] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[10:41:04] <vacho> number can be anything between 1-999
[10:41:13] <robertmaxrees> my last example works.
[10:41:26] <vacho> robertmaxrees: last one works like a charm, thank you good sir
[10:41:37] <taplar> weird, charms don't work for me
[10:44:29] <Voyage_> The Circled icons below the banner (DSTV etc) are ok in http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/ but not perfectly rounded in http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/index-sp-1.html Can any one tell the reason of disappearing of height:16% ?
[10:47:03] <robertmaxrees> your percentage based widths are breaking.
[10:47:21] <robertmaxrees> you're using bootstrap, so use it.
[10:54:15] <rachelr> Have a formatting question...may be easy to answer..http://imgur.com/Uz8ZmTM
[10:54:26] <rachelr> Trying to get my collapsible flush with the list item
[10:54:41] * robertmaxrees looks in his crystal ball
[10:54:41] <rachelr> When I put the collapsible div inside the parent div of the list, it becomes an inset collapsible which I don't want
[10:54:58] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code, it's a width you want to modify on that collapsable.
[10:55:18] <rachelr> even if date-inset = false?
[10:55:20] <rachelr> data*
[10:55:57] <rachelr> http://jsfiddle.net/ghw1ypat/
[10:56:18] <rachelr> I've tried it on the outside of the <content> div as well and there is space between the list item and the start of the collapsible
[10:56:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ghw1ypat/1/ ?
[10:57:03] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't have everything from your image in it.
[10:57:21] <rachelr> no, I have js that populates the list item
[10:57:39] <robertmaxrees> then make a functional example?
[10:57:52] <rachelr> I just posted it there so the html code was visible.
[10:58:06] <rachelr> Since it's formatting, I don't think the js side would matter since that's populating all correctly
[11:02:07] <plop> hi, I try to find an item in an object an idea ? http://jsfiddle.net/ and http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:02:20] <robertmaxrees> plop you need to save and share those URLs
[11:03:03] <plop> woops , http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=SjwljocsKu and http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=aJOm9xt0Rm :)
[11:03:11] <robertmaxrees> err.
[11:03:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:04:28] <robertmaxrees> is element a jquery object?
[11:05:06] <plop> yes
[11:05:18] <robertmaxrees> make an actual fiddle of your code.
[11:05:25] <robertmaxrees> because var element = {}; is not a jquery object.
[11:05:37] <plop> can be a jquery function that can find an item in an object?
[11:05:50] <robertmaxrees> you're confused.  what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:06:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects start with you doing $('someselector') - it's for DOM elements.  this looks like a plain object.
[11:06:13] <plop> I try to look for if an item exists in an object
[11:06:42] <robertmaxrees> if (object.someProp) {}
[11:06:59] <plop> something like $ (# myobject ) .find ( " test) ; // return false or true
[11:07:09] <robertmaxrees> is the object an element?
[11:07:13] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[11:07:44] <plop> yes object
[11:07:45] <robertmaxrees> $() is for selecting elements on the page.
[11:07:54] <robertmaxrees> so you can't use .find() or anything like that.
[11:08:00] <plop> :/
[11:08:28] <plop> there is no search function ?
[11:08:37] <robertmaxrees> i already showed you how to check.
[11:09:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/msu3fgfa/
[11:09:34] <robertmaxrees> notice how the second one doesn't run?
[11:11:22] <plop> yes, i understand
[11:11:28] <plop> thank you
[11:11:41] <plop> it works on all browsers?
[11:11:46] <robertmaxrees> yes
[11:11:51] <plop> :)
[11:14:50] <Anirban_Dutta> Everyone inactive ? :(
[11:14:58] <robertmaxrees> nah
[11:15:34] <Anirban_Dutta> oops. No one's online then.
[11:15:46] <robertmaxrees> 700+ people are in the channel :)
[11:16:19] <Anirban_Dutta> double oops. :3 Chatzilla showing no one's online
[11:16:23] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[11:16:28] <Anirban_Dutta> yeah
[11:16:47] <Anirban_Dutta> I'm having an net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" for a getJSON request
[11:17:35] <Anirban_Dutta> Any guess on that ?
[11:21:38] <webzen> robertmaxrees: i got it done on the back end
[11:21:43] <Finland> hello, why doesn't this work? https://jsfiddle.net/d23dbu7u/ Don't mind having the explanation in the CSS section
[11:21:52] <robertmaxrees> Anirban_Dutta probably a server issue
[11:22:07] <robertmaxrees> Finland because $(".cls2").click(function(){ doesn't exist on pageload.
[11:22:16] <robertmaxrees> that only binds to things that exists with that class on pageload.
[11:22:17] <webzen> http://laravel.io/bin/kW6je
[11:22:22] <robertmaxrees> you need to use event delegation instead.
[11:22:24] <webzen> thanks for the help robertmaxrees
[11:22:33] <taplar> Finland: if your referring to the second click, it's cause it's not bound
[11:22:42] <taplar> the element does not have that class at the time you do the binding
[11:23:09] <robertmaxrees> already said that.
[11:23:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:23:19] <taplar> oh
[11:23:20] <taplar> crap
[11:23:39] <taplar> it's taking me a bit to git use to this updated webchat
[11:23:49] <robertmaxrees> you're using webchat?
[11:23:52] <taplar> yeah
[11:24:06] <taplar> work blocks most ports so i haven't found something else that works
[11:24:45] <robertmaxrees> webzen awesome!  glad to hear :)
[11:24:46] <robertmaxrees> Finland https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d23dbu7u/1/
[11:24:56] <webzen> thanks again
[11:25:01] <robertmaxrees> absolutely :)
[11:25:59] <adv_> robertmaxrees: so here's a working jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ea2zvevq/1/ , how can i make it change the url upon clicking so that i can copy and paste to another user and say open test2 directly?
[11:26:19] <robertmaxrees> use an event binding.
[11:26:25] <Finland> robertmaxrees: thanks, I didn't expect that to work
[11:27:14] <robertmaxrees> adv_ you use window.location.hash = 'someValueHere' to set it, and then read that on pageload
[11:33:58] <adv_> robertmaxrees: found this code (in the commented block) but i'm not sure it's what i want
[11:39:07] <robertmaxrees> what code?
[11:39:23] <adv_> ah sorry.
[11:39:27] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/ea2zvevq/3/
[11:40:23] <Anirban_Dutta> @robertmaxrees , I tried almost anything. my node server is on windows. Turned off firewall, error remains. Allowed my hotspot app for firewall, turned off antivirus shield, but error remains. The getJSON request were at "localhost:8888/app" which node handled with express. I browsed localhost:8888/app from browser. Data is present there. But, can't bring it on page.
[11:40:25] <Anirban_Dutta> I need help to handle this. :(
[11:41:05] <robertmaxrees> Anirban_Dutta are you accessing that from another domain
[11:42:18] <Anirban_Dutta> my laptop ip is 192.168.173.1 (aka localhost for same machine browsers), my remote device ip is 192.168.173.174.
[11:42:26] <Anirban_Dutta> Yeah different domain
[11:42:32] <robertmaxrees> any console errors about CORS?
[11:42:33] <Anirban_Dutta> But how to solve this ?
[11:42:54] <Anirban_Dutta> It did once. I added CORS headers on node server
[11:43:09] <robertmaxrees> then no clue.  ask in #Node.js maybe?
[11:43:11] <Voyage_> How can I properly decrease height of banner http://168.235.66.43/demos/sokopay/index-sp-1.html
[11:43:27] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ make a self-contained fiddle of the problem :)
[11:44:11] <robertmaxrees> though this looks like more of a css issue.
[11:46:12] <jak2000> hi friends i have this jQuery: http://pastie.org/10364705   i need insert 4 records (see the for, line 1) and only, olnly when finished the 4 insertions... i want execute the .done how to?
[11:46:41] <robertmaxrees> read up on deferreds.
[11:47:31] <Anirban_Dutta> hmm. Okay, thanks.
[11:48:01] <Anirban_Dutta> But node logs all request correctly on console
[11:48:01] <adv_> robertmaxrees: did you take a look at the fiddle?
[11:48:14] <robertmaxrees> adv_ oh you updated it.
[11:48:15] <Voyage_> robertmaxrees,  would love to but there are too many things involved. Can you use firebug or some sort of other tool?
[11:48:23] <Anirban_Dutta> That's why i'm worried if it's a xmlhttprequest() issue.
[11:48:43] <robertmaxrees> Voyage_ i'm not going to hunt through all your styles ;)
[11:48:54] <adv_> robertmaxrees: yeah look the commented stuff
[11:48:58] <robertmaxrees> adv_ i don't understand what the commented code has to do with anything.
[11:49:10] <robertmaxrees> you need an event listener .on('click', function() {});
[11:49:28] <adv_> it's related but i can't make it do what i want
[11:49:40] <robertmaxrees> adv_ sure, so ignore it ;)
[11:49:50] <robertmaxrees> bind an event listeners to clicks on the a tags.
[11:50:39] <adv_> ok and then what?
[11:50:55] <robertmaxrees> update the hash of the page.
[11:51:04] <adv_> let me try
[12:15:42] <aro> is there a way to do a jquery select on a group of radio boxes by name, if those names contain square braces?
[12:15:48] <aro>             var selectedValue = $("input[name=data\[Location\]\["+elementIndex+"\]\[display_location\]:checked").val();
[12:15:49] <aro> like that
[12:16:14] <aro> nevermind.. i appear to be missing a square brace
[12:16:57] <aro> uggg
[12:17:05] <aro> it still doenst work. i keep getting unrecognized expression
[12:17:08] <aro> is tehre a way to do it?
[12:18:08] <aro> ok now i think i have it.. i didnt have double slahes
[12:31:39] <_ohm> jquery does a technique when they turn their code from 10000 lines to 1 line and rename all their variables/functions to a,b,c,d(). I cannot remember the name/software that does this. what is it called?
[12:32:09] <_ohm> i cannot for the life of me remember
[12:32:59] <Anirban_Dutta> robertmaxrees: Figured it out. Feeling as stupidest ass in the world. :3 All i did wrong was localhost/app insted of /app inside getJSON().
[12:35:11] <Uhkis> _ohm: uglify is one
[12:35:58] <Uhkis> _ohm: "compressed" or "minified" for general term
[12:36:14] <_ohm> do you rember what tool they used ?
[12:36:26] <Uhkis> uglify
[12:36:34] <_ohm> alright
[12:36:48] <_ohm> thanks
[12:37:37] <_ohm> closure compiler
[12:37:40] <_ohm> yeah that's it
[12:37:43] <_ohm> thanks again
[12:38:20] <Blaster> How can you continue to increment some margin if the mouse click is held down on an anchor?

[13:01:42] <vmsynkov> hello, anyone out there?
[13:02:31] <coolsax98> greetings
[13:03:23] <tash1> anyone in here use dataTables? can't figure out why my copy,csv,xls,pdf buttons aren't showing up
[13:05:05] <tash1> http://pastebin.com/1Q6kaFhr  ... as far as I know the oTableTools is what decides whether it shows or not. It's working fine in another file, just not this one.
[13:08:37] <SherlockHolmesAT> I'm curious, has anyone had an issue with jqueryui themeroller building the jquery-ui.css file incorrectly?
[13:22:01] <adv_> robertBusy: when you said on pageload did you mean $(document).on("pagecontainerload",function(){
[13:22:01] <adv_>  ?
[14:05:25] <sadtaco> "TypeError: b.ownerDocument is undefined" http://jsfiddle.net/aho5hgtp/ what is this black magic
[14:15:20] <sadtaco> Anyone? according to https://api.jqueryui.com/position/ it should work
[14:27:10] <Dr-007> where does it say it should be shown next to the cursor on https://api.jqueryui.com/position/ ?
[14:28:30] <Dr-007> if you're referring to the example

[14:49:34] <Soviet_Jesus_> Hello! Where I work we have a pair of printers that give us access to a remote monitor. By typing in the IP you get a simple little html page that is updated by JS through some xml data. I was able to combine them into a single page using iframes, but now I want to access their content to add additional functionality. The problem I keep running into is that this seems to register as a XSS violation. Is there a easy way around t
[14:50:51] <Soviet_Jesus_> For example I want the page to send an alert message when the text on the remote monitor is a certain value ("Stopped")
[14:52:00] <Soviet_Jesus_> It is probably worth noting that the remote monitor's HTML are hosted on the print server, and I am trying to access it from another computer on the network
[14:58:44] <hydraidm801> how would I make a selector that is all 'td' elements but not if they have the class '.noday'
[14:59:43] <robertBusy> .filter()
[15:03:58] <Soviet_Jesus_> is there anything I should have done to improve my question so that I might have gotten an answer? I thought I was through enough. Or was it not a jquery question at all?
[15:04:09] <robertBusy> sorry i just saw it.
[15:04:15] <robertBusy> and your question is REALLY long
[15:04:39] <robertBusy> also: you have to go server-side to circumvent xss
[15:11:04] <Soviet_Jesus_> So if I understand you right, my current approach of using iframes to nab the monitors html won't work? Or at least won't allow me to do anything with the html content inside the frame?
[15:11:41] <robertBusy> pretty much.
[15:20:06] <Soviet_Jesus_> Is there any approach you could think of that would achieve a similar goal? I don't think I know enough to straight up recreate the monitors. This is a gist of what my html looks like currently: https://gist.github.com/JasonMadeSomething/ab0df00abeddb9da07b1
[15:21:25] <robertmaxrees> use a proxy of some kind and let that hit the page for you.
[15:24:51] <Soviet_Jesus_> Could you point me in the direction of something that would tell me how to do that? All the ways I'm thinking of to do that are somewhat idiotic
[15:25:12] <robertmaxrees> that's basically your only choice.
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> fire a request to a server, and it requests a page using something like curl and sends data back to the requester.
[15:26:03] <Soviet_Jesus_> I appreciate the help by the way, sorry it took me so long to thank you. At least I know my initial plan is baaaad.
[15:26:22] <robertmaxrees> it's fine :)
[15:29:06] <Soviet_Jesus_> Can I do something like keep the monitor iframes and have an ajax request on a timer that checks the xml for the stopped condition? Or is that still XSS?
[15:32:23] <robertmaxrees> ajax needs to respect the same rules as iframes.
[15:32:27] <robertmaxrees> so CORS is still an issue ther.e
[15:35:28] <Soviet_Jesus_> This is all very interesting and infuriating. Who would have thought it would be so hard to get 2 printer monitors into a single page.
[15:35:51] <robertmaxrees> it's so somebody can't hijack the printer from the internet.
[15:36:15] <Soviet_Jesus_> fair enough
[15:39:22] <Soviet_Jesus_> All I can think of is how rails preprocesses .erb files and THEN runs jquery on them. is there any analogous concept here? Or is that more or less the proxy thing you were talking about
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> ruby doesn't run jquery at all.
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> ruby generates a page and that's shot to the browser.
[15:39:56] <robertmaxrees> the final product includes jquery, which runs in thge browser.
[15:40:02] <robertmaxrees> totally different environments.
[15:41:34] <Soviet_Jesus_> my thought process there was that I could somehow get the two monitors into a single html file, and somehow have that conti- nvm I think I see the problem now
[15:42:19] <robertmaxrees> right - things aren't running in ruby - iframes run in the browser.
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:44:20] <Soviet_Jesus_> humdeedum. this seems like quite the task for something I thought would be relatively simple
[15:45:17] <Soviet_Jesus_> so I basically need to be continually curling the pages into an html file that's constantly updating itself? That feels weird to say
[15:46:25] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[15:47:20] <printForever> guys, need a quick answer
[15:47:22] <printForever> simple question
[15:47:28] <printForever> how do I use .not()
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> it removes an element from a selection.
[15:47:39] <printForever> with "this" and a css ID
[15:47:42] <robertmaxrees> it's not what you thing.
[15:47:46] <robertmaxrees> *think
[15:47:57] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClass').not('#id')
[15:48:00] <printForever> so I don't want to select .not(this) and ID
[15:48:24] <robertmaxrees> then use a function.
[15:48:27] <robertmaxrees> or just use .filter()
[15:48:31] <printForever> $('#mainmenu_hor a').not(this).addClass('blur')
[15:48:44] <printForever> so can I use  .not(this, '#id')
[15:48:56] <printForever> btw. tnx robertmaxrees
[15:49:34] <robertmaxrees> look at the docs.
[15:49:38] <printForever> so I don't want to apply class blur to (this) and ('#someId')
[15:49:41] <printForever> I was
[15:49:44] <printForever> thats why I came here
[15:49:46] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() for it.
[15:49:58] <printForever> why can't I use not?
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> look at the doics.
[15:50:14] <robertmaxrees> *docs
[15:50:27] <robertmaxrees> it takes a selector, a function, or a selection.
[15:50:28] <printForever> Isn't .not a filter?
[15:50:36] <robertmaxrees> not the way you need.
[15:50:44] <robertmaxrees> and they operate a little differently.
[15:51:12] <printForever> so I can use .filter( this, "#someId" )
[15:51:36] <robertmaxrees> read the docs
[15:51:55] <printForever> dude its 0:51
[15:52:01] <printForever> I wont be here if I wanted to read the docs
[15:52:04] <printForever> and docs suck
[15:52:25] <robertmaxrees> the jquery docs are great :)
[15:52:29] <printForever> between Wordpress and jQuery its a dead race who has worse documentation
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:52:42] <printForever> docs should be about examples, examples, examples
[15:52:42] <Soviet_Jesus_> alrighty, thank you for all your help, I'm gonna go cry bitter tears at my own ignorance lol
[15:52:54] <robertmaxrees> the jquery docs have examples
[15:53:24] <printForever> they suck galactically
[15:53:36] <robertmaxrees> most people disagree with you.
[15:53:41] <printForever> what can I use to filter (this) and #id
[15:53:48] <printForever> yeah, thats why they come here for help
[15:54:03] <printForever> if that was true, this channel would be empty
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry you're having trouble.
[15:54:09] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason to be nasty with me about it.
[15:54:10] <printForever> I'm too
[15:54:16] <printForever> :) I'm not
[15:54:23] <robertmaxrees> actually you are.
[15:54:26] <printForever> I'm just typing really fast :)
[15:54:32] <robertmaxrees> the docs are generally regarded as fantastic
[15:54:38] <printForever> .filter offers no help, because .not is a filter itself
[15:54:40] <robertmaxrees> i rarely hear complains.
[15:54:48] <robertmaxrees> .filter() ius much easier in this case.
[15:54:50] <printForever> I can complain all day long, just not now
[15:54:56] <printForever> I believe you, show me how
[15:55:16] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/#filter-function - also "Using a Filter Function"
[15:55:38] <printForever> Type: Function( Integer index, Element element ) => Boolean
[15:55:47] <printForever> I have no idea how this is applicable
[15:55:53] <robertmaxrees> right.  check out the second that starts "Using a Filter Function"
[15:55:56] <robertmaxrees> is has an example/.
[15:56:25] <printForever> what does Index mean?
[15:56:28] <printForever> its the entire page?
[15:56:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:56:42] <robertmaxrees> you actually don't need to pass it.
[15:56:48] <robertmaxrees> the example is very clear.
[15:56:48] <printForever> but what is it
[15:56:56] <robertmaxrees> it's the relative "index" of that element.
[15:56:59] <Soviet_Jesus_> the ith?
[15:57:11] <robertmaxrees> its "number" within the jquery object.
[15:57:14] <printForever> so it "indexes" the select element?
[15:57:22] <robertmaxrees> it's the index of the element
[15:57:32] <robertmaxrees> but you don't need to use it.
[15:57:36] <Soviet_Jesus_> sorry, just curious, I'll lurk moar
[15:57:37] <printForever> it indexes them so I can filter them
[15:57:39] <robertmaxrees> $(this) will refer to the current element.
[15:57:40] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:57:42] <robertmaxrees> it doesn;'t.
[15:57:54] <printForever> I know that this refers to the element
[15:57:56] <robertmaxrees> index is the numeric index of that element relative to the others in the selection.
[15:58:12] <robertmaxrees> since the jquery object is array-like./
[15:58:19] <printForever> ooooh... ok
[15:58:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2xmqf3fo/
[15:58:55] <printForever> so .filter(function() { return $(this).not(this)? ???
[15:58:57] <robertmaxrees> so you can do this.
[15:58:57] <printForever> I'm confused
[15:59:28] <printForever> so I'm filtering the div
[15:59:39] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle
[15:59:52] <robertmaxrees> that'll make this easy to explain
[15:59:58] <printForever> I'm looking for this??? that doesn't have property ID in the bar?
[16:00:04] <printForever> I'm looking at the fiddle
[16:00:18] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle of your case.
[16:00:19] <printForever> what is $(this) ?
[16:00:25] <printForever> is it the DIV?
[16:00:27] <robertmaxrees> the current element in the filter
[16:00:37] <printForever> ouh ok, now I understand
[16:00:46] <printForever> and I'm looking for property 'id'
[16:00:54] <printForever> that is not similar to bar
[16:00:59] <printForever> and I'm adding class red to it
[16:01:02] <printForever> correct?
[16:01:39] <robertmaxrees> that isn't bar.
[16:01:43] <robertmaxrees> not just dissimilar.
[16:01:51] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, that's the basic idea.
[16:01:56] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what the docs tell you, btw.
[16:02:27] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/2xmqf3fo/1/
[16:02:58] <robertmaxrees> that's... not helpful.
[16:03:02] <robertmaxrees> show me your markup.
[16:03:19] <printForever> its just menu and sub menu
[16:03:25] <printForever> and I dont want to add it to submenu
[16:03:27] <printForever> thats all
[16:03:31] <printForever> simple two lists
[16:03:34] <printForever> with links
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> i can't divine your markup.
[16:03:44] <printForever> UL > LI > UL > LI
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[16:03:49] <printForever> ok
[16:04:01] <robertmaxrees> this is why we ask for simple examples.
[16:04:18] <printForever> and thats why examples on jQuery docs suck
[16:04:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:04:24] <robertmaxrees> they're pretty clear.
[16:04:25] <printForever> they do
[16:04:31] <printForever> when you make a basic example
[16:04:36] <printForever> the one a child can do
[16:04:40] <printForever> you really cant learn anything
[16:04:44] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/5GaGv3z.png
[16:04:48] <printForever> apart just reproducing it
[16:04:48] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty clear.
[16:04:54] <printForever> examples should be complex
[16:05:07] <printForever> and show you different things and techniques
[16:05:10] <robertmaxrees> these do.
[16:05:19] <printForever> I'm sorry, they really don't
[16:05:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry you're having a difficult time, though - you should provide feedback :)
[16:05:31] <printForever> like, your 3 lines example is more useful than anything there
[16:05:35] <robertmaxrees> most people I've met don't have that many issues wit them.
[16:05:43] <printForever> I know.
[16:05:45] <robertmaxrees> my three lines are almost identical.
[16:05:49] <printForever> different people learn in different way
[16:05:56] <printForever> not to me
[16:06:33] <robertmaxrees> the differences are the criteria they match on and the way they apply css.
[16:06:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, basically the same thing.
[16:07:12] <printForever> and still I value yours 10x more
[16:07:14] <printForever> go figure
[16:07:24] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't make any sense.
[16:07:39] <robertmaxrees> either way, https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com <- p[lease feel free to leave feedback here for the team to work with :)
[16:10:43] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[16:13:03] <Soviet_Jesus_> you sir, are a saint
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:13:56] <robertmaxrees> some people just need to vent.
[16:14:05] <robertmaxrees> they used to hang out in here with really.. interesting questions.
[16:16:26] <Soviet_Jesus_> I generally come to IRC with the assumption that everything I did and was doing is wrong and awful.
[16:16:59] <Soviet_Jesus_> otherwise my damn code would work/not be an ugly POS
[17:01:55] <ashgotti> Hello all. I'm hitting a wall trying to figure out how to "undo". I have a select field that based on the selection adds the value of the preceeding text field to another field. The problem is that I don't know how to "undo" the adding if the user selects one option then changes their mind.
[17:02:02] <ashgotti> You can see an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/ep3cgdpk/ 1. Enter a balance (notice that Payments Remaining calculates on blur). 2. Select a different Payoff method and notice the values change. 3. Select another Payoff method and my "undo" doesn't work
[17:07:01] <wa5ted> any of my regulars around
[17:07:17] <wa5ted> or people i know
[17:07:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm kind of here.
[17:07:28] <wa5ted> hey
[17:07:29] <wa5ted> whats up
[17:08:29] <robertmaxrees> workin'.  you?
[17:24:51] <ashgotti> bah got disconnected. Anyone have a method or strategy for "undoing" calculations? i.e. if you use a select list that adds a value to a number and the user changes their selection, the calculation changes.
[18:14:35] <SirLagz> I need an opinion - which of the answers to this SO question would be the most 'best practice' - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17724017/using-jquery-to-build-table-rows-from-ajax-responsejson ?
[18:15:30] <SirLagz> I'm leaning towards the one by hmkcode, but wonder if that's really the best way to do things
[18:23:49] <enet> SirLagz, i think that almost ideal variant was suggested by tymeJV
[18:24:13] <Soviet_Jesus_> So I did some research on how to get around the same origin issue I was having, but I'm struggling to see how to apply what I "learned"
[18:24:20] <SirLagz> enet: ah yes. I missed that last answer.
[18:24:44] <SirLagz> enet: I'll be using a $.each to build the row anyway, so hmkcode's answer suits me a bit better I think
[18:25:17] <Soviet_Jesus_> https://gist.github.com/JasonMadeSomething/ab0df00abeddb9da07b1 this is my html as it is, and http://qnimate.com/same-origin-policy-in-nutshell/ this apparently tells me how to do it. Can someone help me understand how to put 2 and 2 together here?
[18:25:51] <Soviet_Jesus_> I want to be able to use jquery on the DOM of the two things I have in iframes
[18:27:36] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: are the iframes in the same domain?
[18:27:57] <Soviet_Jesus_> they are not
[18:28:05] <Soviet_Jesus_> they are two separate print servers
[18:28:23] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: do you have access to the web servers that both the page and the stuff in the iframes run on?
[18:29:18] <Soviet_Jesus_> I've been running the page locally, and I'm not sure if I have access to the servers in all honesty
[18:29:48] <Soviet_Jesus_> All of the parts involved are on a single network though, if that makes a difference
[18:30:26] <Soviet_Jesus_> the gist is only 22 lines, it'll probably be more informative than I am capable of
[18:34:00] <Soviet_Jesus_> sorry if my question isn't very good. I'm just sick of having a lame printer monitor
[18:36:24] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: well. you could always build a php with a server side scripting language to do ajax requests to bypass the cross domain issue
[18:37:07] <Soviet_Jesus_> but then won't I have to rebuilt the monitor itself?
[18:37:43] <Soviet_Jesus_> My *hope* was that there was some way to "break" the iframe so that I can access it's DOM elements
[18:39:05] <Soviet_Jesus_> the iframe was just to get the 2 windows onto a single page, but I would really like it if I could have it alert me when certain things happen, like if one of the monitors says the printer has stopped
[18:39:25] <Soviet_Jesus_> but alas, that's apparently XSS
[18:39:43] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: it's possible to do if you use Windows and build a .hta application, and lower your security settings to the absolute lowest
[18:40:33] <Soviet_Jesus_> That sounds less confusing than the article I found, I'll look into that now
[18:40:39] <Soviet_Jesus_> Thanks SirLagz
[18:40:45] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: no problems
[18:43:04] <Soviet_Jesus_> I don't need visual studio for that, right?
[18:45:18] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: nope
[18:45:28] <SirLagz> Soviet_Jesus_: you need notepad. :P
[18:45:52] <Soviet_Jesus_> cool, so I can continue right were i left off
[21:30:54] <tomatto> how is done confirm dialog? i want to implement my own, but i don't understand how to return true/false based on button clicked from function which shows up that dialog
[21:41:31] <lenswipee> tomatto: use jQuery dialog to create your own confirm dialog.
[21:43:21] <tomatto> lenswipee: i want bootstrap like confirm dialog
[21:44:00] <lenswipee> tomatto: you got url of an example I can view?
[21:44:31] <tomatto> lenswipee: example of bootstrap dialog?

[23:43:55] <Kartagis> hi. I've got this code which jshint approves but the browser gives me Unexpected token < for it. can you help? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/p2owo813/
[23:45:49] <Uhkis> Kartagis: very probably your json is not json
[23:46:03] <Kartagis> no it is json
[23:46:56] <Kartagis> Uhkis: http://www.rejicast.com/oyuncular.json
[23:47:47] <Kartagis> Uhkis: the thing is. jquery gives me that error
[23:47:59] <Kartagis> I mean jquery.js
[23:48:02] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/p2owo813/1/ it works just fine?
[23:48:36] <Kartagis> one sec, let me upload what I have
[23:51:55] <Kartagis> weird
[23:53:49] <Kartagis> Uhkis: please go to http://html.webcinizim.com/rejicast/www/ and click on "Tüm Oyuncular"
[23:55:01] <Uhkis> Kartagis: yup, it's html, not json
[23:55:22] <Uhkis> Kartagis: it's a 404 page
[23:56:15] <Kartagis> Uhkis: how so? it's the very same code making an ajax request to the very same url
[23:56:31] <Uhkis> The requested URL /rejicast/www/cordova.js was not found on this server.
[23:57:13] <Cork> Kartagis: you have a scary undefined variable in your ajax
[23:57:50] <Kartagis> Uhkis: that is added on runtime, no worries
[23:57:57] <Kartagis> Cork: how so?
[23:58:12] <Cork> cnt is never defined
[23:58:27] <Cork> so another method may conflict with your use of the global name
[23:58:41] <Cork> cnt is global, not local
[23:58:53] <Kartagis> so I need var cnt
[23:58:58] <Cork> yes
[23:59:24] <Uhkis> i just died a little inside after seeing that whooping >2000 char line :D
[23:59:43] <Cork> Uhkis: you mean the json?
