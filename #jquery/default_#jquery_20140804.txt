[01:52:16] <cannap> dayum live on delegate nothing is working all time correct i need more as one click to delete my element -.-
[01:52:19] <cannap> dont know why this happens
[02:23:27] <Oipo> How come ajaxSettings is part of the ui parameter in beforeLoad but not in Load? (see: http://jsfiddle.net/Kysf3/36/ )
[02:40:48] <delboy1978uk> how do i grab geolocation? i'm looking at this http://diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html band it says i should do this but i dont have a show_map variable or function?  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(show_map);
[02:41:34] <delboy1978uk> lol its further down the page :-P
[02:41:45] <cannap> dayum i linked the click event on the small icon and i never clicked the icon only the outter button  :/
[02:41:50] <cannap> now all works fine
[02:45:51] <DarsVaeda> if I do .on('click.namespace', function() { muchcode; }) and then .off('click.namespace') is there a way to .on() it again without having to do the much code thing again, I mean except capsulating this in a function
[03:00:19] <Myrtti> excellent $timeofday to each and everyone
[03:01:07] <Myrtti> ♥
[03:29:06] <mooru> I have a jquery script that appends some atributes into the DOM. i also have some kind of form that loads by ajax on that form. When i load the form by ajax, the jquery scripts loads several times. How can i stop this from happeneing
[04:14:54] <sacho> do you have an example of what you're doing?
[04:59:16] <t432> if an element's visibility is invisible, will this element still be selectiable?
[06:08:40] <airdem> how can i use parents() to find the first parent that has an id attribute?
[06:08:53] <airdem> .parents('tr[id]') <-- maybe like this?
[06:18:48] <systemfault> airdem: The question doesn’t make sense because you can’t have 2 elements having the same id on a page
[06:19:08] <systemfault> airdem: So, you can simply do: $('#' + id)
[06:19:16] <systemfault> Ahhh
[06:19:16] <airdem> i want to get the id
[06:19:20] <systemfault> Any id attribute?
[06:19:23] <airdem> yep
[06:19:46] <systemfault> Then just use .closest('[id]');
[06:20:16] <airdem> closest would stop at first match, right=
[06:20:17] <airdem> ?
[06:20:38] <airdem> or why should i use it instead of parents() ?
[06:23:57] <dmsuperman> yes airdem
[06:24:19] <dmsuperman> airdem: For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.
[06:34:58] <umdstu> i have a jQuery function that takes in a data array, and uses it to initialize a Select2 object. in the anonymous `query:` function of the Select2 options, there is a callback, which does not seem to see the data object, but the function see's it fine. how do I get the anonymous function to see the data array?
[06:35:47] <Deele> umdstu, store data array in context, which is accessible to function you require
[06:37:11] <xxx1337> f
[06:39:18] <umdstu> Deele: so I need to store it in the dom somewhere so I can fetch it in the callback
[06:39:49] <Deele> umdstu, it all depends on how deep your callback is
[06:40:08] <Deele> umdstu, most generic approach would be to use jquery .data() possibilities
[06:40:30] <umdstu> right, alright i'll look at that. thanks Deele

[07:09:09] <airdem_> Error: cannot call methods on tooltip prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'open'

[07:09:32] <airdem_> is there no better way
[07:09:34] <airdem_> ?
[07:16:07] <BillCriswell> airdem_: Which tooltip plugin are you using?
[07:16:31] <airdem_> BillCriswell, jquery UI
[07:18:54] <BillCriswell> airdem_: I typically see it like var $foo = $('foo').tooltip(); then like $foo.tooltip('open'); when it's needed.
[07:31:38] <delboy1978uk> i'm trying to loop through each item in a list of json, but cant seem to do it, can anyone help? http://pastie.org/9444419
[07:34:01] <systemfault> delboy1978uk: Can’t help if you don’t give us an example of what’s returned by that api call.
[07:34:33] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: To use each with a javascript array instead of a jQuery collection you'd typically do $.each( array, function (index, value) { /* value would be element in array */ }); Though, you might be better off just using forEach here or just a for loop.
[07:35:06] <delboy1978uk> systemfault I pasted the actual url too so you can see it for yourself
[07:35:41] <delboy1978uk> i'm using .each(), but it still seems to log the json together
[07:36:13] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: That url is relative.
[07:40:20] <delboy1978uk> BillCriswell: what difference does that make?
[07:41:31] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: http://jsbin.com/xuyukigu/1/edit?html,js,output this should be all you need to do.
[07:43:09] <moeschmi> Hello, is it possible to save a selector (like $("#id")) into a var? I tried that, but when I try var.hide(); it doesn't work
[07:43:36] <decx> you named your var var
[07:43:51] <decx> vart vart in the burt
[07:44:14] <decx> i know it's js but i dont think that works
[07:44:15] <moeschmi> that was an example, sorry
[07:44:26] <moeschmi> i didn't name it var :D
[07:44:39] <decx> var blah = $('#blah'); blah.hide() will work
[07:44:46] <decx> your error must be somewehre else
[07:45:27] <moeschmi> ah, yes it does. I tried accessing it via this.. m(
[07:46:54] <SkyLeach> anyone have time to look at a simple jquery memory caching object and explain why the literal object is undefined later? (http://jsfiddle.net/skyleach/3394Y/)
[07:48:06] <decx> dont attach arbitrary objects to jquery
[07:49:46] <decx> , get cacheobj() { isnt valid either inside a literal
[07:52:39] <systemfault> Of course it's valid
[07:52:56] <decx> yeah, no
[07:53:00] <decx> what?
[07:53:00] <systemfault> Yeah.. yeah
[07:53:08] <systemfault> ES5 getters/setters
[07:53:23] <decx> ah
[07:53:45] <systemfault> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/F6cCy/
[07:54:03] <SkyLeach> the problem is that my setter is saying that my literal is undefined during the $.each loop
[07:54:10] <systemfault> They're still relatively unused… because they're slow and not supported on old browsers (like IE8)
[07:54:56] <SkyLeach> saved me a lot of code for this.  Default values on certain keys if/when they exist.
[07:55:00] <decx> so what's different to { lol: function(){ return 10 }
[07:55:56] <decx> nvm i read up on it
[07:55:59] <systemfault> :P
[07:56:09] <decx> it's still ugly ^^
[07:56:17] <systemfault> I agree.
[07:57:27] <systemfault> SkyLeach: The "this"  at line 54 might not be the "this" you want
[07:57:39] <SkyLeach> { _data = {}, get data() { return this._data; }, set data(obj} { if('key' in obj) { this._data = obj; } else { obj.key = 'default' } } }
[07:57:57] <SkyLeach> no, it isn't
[07:57:58] <SkyLeach> you're right
[07:58:03] <SkyLeach> $.each context
[07:58:04] <SkyLeach> my bad
[08:13:23] <DarsVaeda> how can I mimik this selector "element>foo>bar" when the element I operate with is "element"?
[08:13:49] <robertmaxrees> $element.find('>foo>bar') should work.
[08:15:23] <DarsVaeda> hrm okay
[08:15:26] <DarsVaeda> thanks
[08:16:23] <robertmaxrees> lol somebody made http://saveie6.com/
[08:16:36] <robertmaxrees> but if you hit the site in ie11, you get http://i.imgur.com/Vw1lR6e.png
[08:17:22] <BillCriswell> I wonder how hard it would be to switch to IE6.
[08:17:43] <MaSOuD> Unbearable.
[08:17:57] <decx> that-shit-aint-funny-motherfucker-eddie-murphy.gif
[08:18:42] <Jagst3r21> anyone know how I would hide the selector when the dropdown is triggered? http://hastebin.com/xoxegexipo.js
[08:19:01] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: It's a "joke" website :)
[08:19:02] <BillCriswell> I watched "Another 48 hours" last night accidentally. I saw "48 hours" on the screen when it ended adn was just ocnfused.
[08:19:12] <robertmaxrees> systemfault i know.  just thought it was a funny oversight.
[08:19:15] <Jagst3r21> or the fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/XUwN5/1/
[08:19:18] <systemfault> :D
[08:19:37] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 hrm?  hide what selector?  the one that was clicked?
[08:19:54] <decx> but how do you close it again when there's no button
[08:20:03] <decx> that's some tree in the woods question
[08:20:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's a little weird
[08:20:56] <Jagst3r21> robertmaxrees when you click on the information then that class, "selector", should be hid
[08:21:04] <robertmaxrees> unelss the idea is that it hides when you click anywhere else.
[08:21:33] <robertmaxrees> and you'd hide .selector like you would anything else...  if you mean the specific thing that was clicked, you want $(this)
[08:21:52] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: Just spoofed my user agent to IE6, here's the result: http://imgur.com/Iez7fsi
[08:22:22] <robertmaxrees> systemfault good.  at least they got that part right.
[08:23:07] <decx> spoofing user agents? you are now banned from r/pyongyang ... i mean r/ie6
[08:23:45] <mooncup> has anyone had much experience with datatables?
[08:24:51] <Jagst3r21> robertmaxrees can u show me an example of that, im not sure how i would do it
[08:25:11] <robertmaxrees> the same way you'd hide anything else?  $(this).hide() inside of the handler.
[08:31:27] <uskerine> hi, in datatables.net, how could a column be defined to be right aligned? I have a column with prices and I would like to have it right-aligned
[08:31:56] <robertmaxrees> i really wish datatables would get their own channel :(
[08:31:59] <BillCriswell> uskerine: text-align: right in the css.
[08:32:36] <Jagst3r21> robertmaxrees yay> http://jsfiddle.net/XUwN5/97/
[08:32:39] <uskerine> datatables really helps front-end development
[08:32:46] <uskerine> thanks billcriswell
[08:32:47] <uskerine> I'll try that
[08:32:56] <uskerine> but how can I refer a specific column?
[08:33:11] <uskerine> what would you use as "select"
[08:33:12] <uskerine> ?
[08:33:37] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I'd have to see the classes on the table that's generated. I'm not familiar with datatables.
[08:33:42] <robertmaxrees> uskerine i'm not saying it doesn't help anything, but people are in here all the time asking for help - wonder why they haven't set up their own support channel yet.
[08:33:52] <uskerine> there is a forum in the web site
[08:33:59] <uskerine> I usually use both, just in case
[08:34:06] <uskerine> a separate channel would help, that's true
[08:34:18] <robertmaxrees> you should suggest that to the maintainers.
[08:34:29] <DarsVaeda> I have a <select> in an element that has a mouseleave, as soon as I want to select an <option> the mouseleave is fired, what is a good way to prevent that, I googled but all those solutions seem quite funky
[08:36:12] <robertmaxrees> DarsVaeda what solutions did you see?
[08:36:40] <uskerine> found it
[08:36:40] <uskerine> http://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/js_array.html
[08:36:55] <DarsVaeda> like wrapping with divs and strange other ones
[08:37:07] <DarsVaeda> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6212309/problem-with-jquery-mouseleave-firing-when-container-has-select-box
[08:38:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .on() instead of .live(), but that's going to be close to your best bet.
[08:39:09] <DarsVaeda> uhm thats not my code I'm using .on
[08:39:53] <robertmaxrees> DarsVaeda i'm not saying that's your code.  i'm saying that with the code given you should use .on() instead and that's basically your best bet.
[08:50:42] <Allen300> 'lo
[08:50:46] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[08:51:17] <Allen300> I'm getting a CORS error. Cross-Origin Request Blocked
[08:51:32] <Allen300> is there a way to enable that in jquery?
[08:51:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:51:49] <robertmaxrees> the server you're requesting data from must explicitly allow cross-origin requests.
[08:51:52] <Allen300> the error continues... "This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS."
[08:52:01] <Allen300> yes I own that server
[08:52:21] <robertmaxrees> okay - then you need to fix it on the server level or move the script to a page that's on the same domain, port, and protocol
[08:52:36] <Allen300> it is on the same domain
[08:52:45] <robertmaxrees> port and protocol?
[08:53:03] <Allen300> ohh wait
[08:53:09] <Allen300> difference is in the www.
[08:53:15] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[08:53:21] <robertmaxrees> you can also fix your server
[08:53:25] <robertmaxrees> !g enable cors
[08:53:26] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: enable cross-origin resource sharing → http://enable-cors.org/
[08:53:37] <robertmaxrees> ^ this site has resourced that can help you.
[08:53:43] <Allen300> well it's more secure not to enable it right?
[08:53:50] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[08:53:51] <Lehl0r> does anyone know issues regarding background-position in safari ?
[08:54:09] <Lehl0r> so it seems safari just puts my background 2 pixel less than in ie and ff
[08:54:21] <robertmaxrees> Lehl0r all browsers are a little different.
[08:54:29] <Lehl0r> when i do background-position: top left 0px 0px;
[08:54:29] <delboy1978uk> check for margins/padding
[08:54:37] <robertmaxrees> i woukdn't rely on pixel-perfect accuracy in everything, but that's me.
[08:54:39] <snover> Allen300: yes
[08:54:40] <snover> telling people to blindly enable CORS is not a very good idea
[08:55:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm not blindly suggesting it - i'm pointing him to a resource that can help him further.
[08:55:07] <Allen300> ;S
[08:55:07] <robertmaxrees> sorry for not clearly communicating that.
[08:55:15] <snover> that site tells people to just allow it for all domains
[08:55:25] <snover> “For simple CORS requests, the server only needs to add the following header to its response: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *”
[08:55:35] <snover> what terrible advice
[08:55:53] <robertmaxrees> okay, then let me preface that - you should read up and make the appropriate decision for yourself.
[08:56:49] <Allen300> wow
[08:56:58] <Allen300> :S
[08:57:55] <robertmaxrees> Allen300 it's an important topic to understand.  i can see why he feels so strongly.
[08:58:58] <sacho> that should say, "for simple services with no sensitive or secret data.."
[08:59:12] <sacho> not for "simple cors requests", which is a description of most cors requests.
[08:59:19] <Allen300> robertmaxrees: ah okay I understand
[08:59:22] <robertmaxrees> that's an excellent idea
[08:59:27] * Allen300 spanks snover 
[09:00:02] <sacho> Allen300, security is rarely measured on a sliding interval
[09:00:14] <sacho> "more secure and less secure" are fairly meaningless statements
[09:00:26] <Allen300> ah ok
[09:00:29] <Allen300> so how is it measured
[09:00:47] <sacho> if you want something secure, you usually want security that is close to infinitely hard to break.
[09:01:01] <sacho> at that point, talking about "less secure" and "more secure" doesn't make sense
[09:02:04] <sacho> of course, you could consider that a server serving its data with CORS enabled is absolutely "less secure" than one serving it without, since there are more than 0 use cases where having CORS enabled could lead to you leaking data you don't want to leak
[09:02:08] <sacho> but it's not a very useful measure
[09:03:23] <sacho> generally, the question to ask yourself about CORS is "do I trust domain X to use my user's data", when enabling CORS for domain X.
[09:03:47] <robertmaxrees> or to not misuse your user's data :)
[09:04:14] <sacho> when you enable CORS for domain X, for all intents and purposes, you are placing the same trust in domain X that the user places in your site
[09:04:53] <sacho> (for the specific part of your site that you enable cors)
[09:08:10] <robertmaxrees> well that was fun.
[09:10:19] <BillCriswell> Hm, .wrap() was just confusing me haha
[09:10:30] <BillCriswell> Common sense stuff but caught me off guard.
[09:12:03] <BillCriswell> for some reason I was thinking that $foo.wrap('<div class="wrapper"></div>'); would mean $foo would now be <div class="wrapper"><div class="foo">...</div></div>
[09:12:27] <Allen300>  sacho so you're saying I can enable CORS to domain X? it's not just for all?
[09:12:50] <Allen300> In that case, there should be no problem enabling www.example.com if your domain is example.com
[09:13:29] <Allen300> cause my issue is that if a user uses example.com, CORS restriction does allow you to use www.example.com in ajax request
[09:13:42] <sacho> you can enable CORS for a single domain.
[09:14:06] <sacho> eh, that sounds like an issue with your web server.
[09:14:16] <sacho> why are you making requests to www.example.com instead of example.com?
[09:14:46] <robertmaxrees> maybe he's on www. and is sending requests to the one without.
[09:20:33] <damarusama> beginner question here, can I have multiple function under the (document).ready(function() {
[09:20:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.  you could put all your code there if you really wanted.
[09:21:10] <damarusama> kool thanks :D
[09:21:27] <BillCriswell> damarusama: You can do like $(document).read(function(){ foo(); bar(); baz(); }); or put all the functions in an init() function and do like $(init);
[09:39:19] <yuung> when making an ajax call, what determines the data parameter in the success field?
[09:39:27] <robertmaxrees> the returned data
[09:39:31] <yuung> $.ajax({ success: function(data){ etc..
[09:39:36] <dmsuperman> dataType will translate it
[09:39:36] <yuung> so not an echo, right?
[09:39:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:39:48] <robertmaxrees> it's whatever would get pushed to the browser.
[09:39:53] <robertmaxrees> ajax has no knowledge of your backend.
[09:40:19] <yuung> ah so it is what gets echo'd?
[09:40:19] <systemfault> yuung: You're overthinking it. AJAX is just the browser's HTTP client. (Like curl or wget)
[09:40:25] <dmsuperman> an echo would dump to the browser though likely yes
[09:40:27] <yuung> ohhhhhhh
[09:40:28] <yuung> i see
[09:40:32] <yuung> @systemfault
[09:40:39] <robertmaxrees> yuung hit the URL directly - that's the data.
[09:40:51] <yuung> robertmaxrees, systemfault, gotcha - thanks
[10:14:12] <Jagst3r21> any idea why there is a delay on the images loading using flexslider? http://dev.semgeeks.com:8888/gothamist/nike/
[10:37:14] <MikeD_> is .map() supposed to return an array or an object?
[10:37:38] <robertmaxrees> the docs say an Array, which is also an object.
[10:38:20] <MikeD_> so i have to .get() before i .join()
[10:39:04] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?

[10:41:11] <Jagst3r21> maybe its me
[10:41:16] <decx> no
[10:41:23] <decx> it's not showing at all
[10:41:28] <decx> only after the first click
[10:41:32] <robertmaxrees> thats odd.
[10:41:37] <Jagst3r21> i dont get it :x
[10:41:51] <decx> my guess is it's flexslider giving height 0 to the image because the container holding the flexslider is hidden on init
[10:42:31] <decx> width 0
[10:42:35] <decx> there you go
[10:45:15] <Jagst3r21> decx thank you
[10:49:42] <uskerine> how do I get closest parent 'tr'?
[10:49:56] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery closest
[10:49:58] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .closest() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[10:57:15] <Es0teric> has anyone here used jeditable?
[10:57:53] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for specific info on it, Es0teric?
[10:58:09] <decx> use the force, we're out of padding
[10:58:11] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: well yeah.. i mean i have a form and then editable fields in it
[10:58:28] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Es0teric
[10:58:29] <b-ot> Es0teric: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:58:29] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:58:58] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: basically when you have editable fields, is there any way to stop it from creating a new form and just using the current form the content is in?
[10:59:28] <robertmaxrees> could you create a fiddle?
[11:00:13] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: ok at the basic level, i have a form with PHP_SELF as the action
[11:00:32] <Es0teric> and theres jeditable fields in it… i just want the form data after submit via PHP submit
[11:02:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?  your html and javascript have no knowledge of the backend.
[11:11:44] <METEMEDO> hi
[11:11:48] <METEMEDO> i'm going crazy
[11:12:48] <METEMEDO> i have some checkboxes like this
[11:13:16] <METEMEDO> <input type="checkbox" name="alterar_grupos[]" value="5" style="position: absolute; opacity: 0;">
[11:13:16] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: again, lets say a user submits a form using the submit button, how would i get the info modified from jeditable?
[11:14:13] <METEMEDO> so, this logs the forms correctly: $('input[name="alterar_grupos[]"]').each(function() {console.log(this);});
[11:14:45] <METEMEDO> but this says "TypeError: undefined is not a function": $('input[name="alterar_grupos[]"]').each(function() {console.log(this.val());});
[11:15:31] <METEMEDO> i can't understand why, i'm trying to debug this thing for like an hour already
[11:16:27] <aaronds> When registering  a click listener to all objects with a certain class, how can I ensure that newly added objects also have the same listener attached?
[11:17:25] <METEMEDO> aaronds: do $(document).on('click', function() { ... });
[11:17:43] <lpommers> METEMEDO try putting things into a jsfiddle so we can see what's happening
[11:17:59] <METEMEDO> ok
[11:19:29] <robertmaxrees> AaronCampbell you don't - use event delegation instead.
[11:19:34] <robertmaxrees> err, aaronds
[11:20:50] <aaronds> METEMEDO: newly created objects with said class wil still not have the required listener (newly created as in after page load and after the listener has been registered).
[11:21:11] <robertmaxrees> event delegation for everybody!
[11:21:37] <aaronds> METEMEDO: unless .on('click' can be called without duplicating the listeners for the objects with listeners already attached?
[11:21:41] <METEMEDO> aaronds: they will, because you are attaching the listener to $(document)
[11:21:49] <aaronds> oh $(document)
[11:21:54] <aaronds> misread, sorry.
[11:21:57] <METEMEDO> :)
[11:21:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd bind further down than document, but yep.
[11:22:10] <METEMEDO> or body
[11:22:32] <robertmaxrees> or some other container you're writing in - that way you don't have to filter for every event that comes up.
[11:22:42] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric it looks like jeditable (which is hard to not read as "jedi table") talks about getting that content in its docs.
[11:22:54] <aaronds> Yeah that'll work, just reviewed the docs for .on and .delegate
[11:22:58] <aaronds> cheers guys
[11:23:00] <robertmaxrees> don't use .delegate btw
[11:23:12] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: can you point me to that?
[11:23:17] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric the front page?
[11:25:24] <METEMEDO> pffff
[11:25:29] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: that doesnt work as i want it to
[11:25:38] <METEMEDO> about my issue
[11:25:42] <robertmaxrees> could you make a fiddle then, Es0teric?
[11:25:43] <METEMEDO> nvm
[11:25:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: well i can show you my current js
[11:25:55] <robertmaxrees> METEMEDO did you figure it out?
[11:26:05] <Es0teric> but making a fiddle would be kinda of.. challengeing
[11:26:08] <Es0teric> *challenging
[11:26:15] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[11:26:28] <METEMEDO> robertmaxrees: yeah, i think i'm tired now. i was using this.val() instead of $(this).val()
[11:26:31] <METEMEDO> for an hour
[11:26:37] <METEMEDO> jesus
[11:26:45] <robertmaxrees> this.value should work, too ;)
[11:26:53] <robertmaxrees> it's always something simple.
[11:27:08] <METEMEDO> this.value is non-jquery
[11:27:13] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[11:27:17] <METEMEDO> yeah but :D
[11:27:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:27:35] <METEMEDO> but i wasnt even realizing that i wasnt using the jquery notation
[11:27:41] <METEMEDO> thats the problem
[11:28:11] <robertmaxrees> that'
[11:28:25] <robertmaxrees> *that's partially why i almost always start all event handlers and the like with var $this = $(this);
[11:29:45] <METEMEDO> does that increase performance?
[11:30:05] <robertmaxrees> if you reference $(this) more than once, yes.
[11:30:11] <METEMEDO> i mean, if i call $(this) several times inside the for
[11:30:12] <METEMEDO> oh
[11:30:27] <METEMEDO> didn't know that
[11:30:31] <keNzi> Hi ;)
[11:30:34] <keNzi> I'm looking for a recent book about HTML5 (boostrap, sass, jquery, etc.) - could anyone recommend me any?
[11:30:42] <robertmaxrees> every time you call $() is an expensive operation
[11:32:07] <decx> keNzi http://devdocs.io/
[11:32:09] <robertmaxrees> keNzi those are 4 different topics.
[11:32:54] <keNzi> robertmaxrees: then recommend me 2-3 books ;)
[11:33:13] <robertmaxrees> JavaScript: The Definitive Guide and JavaScript: The Good Parts are great for javascript imo.
[11:41:11] <rhizome> can pseudoselectors be stacked? like input:text[value='']:first
[11:41:33] <BillCriswell> rhizome: Yes. It might not work like  you're expecting though.
[11:42:55] <robertmaxrees> I'd also make sure you're narrowing your choices down as much as possible to a subset of the dom first.
[11:43:27] <BillCriswell> Er, I was thinking :first-child
[11:43:35] <BillCriswell> rhizome: What you're doing should be fine.
[11:44:17] <BillCriswell> Actually, what are you expecting :text to get?
[11:45:13] <rhizome> the first empty text input from a set within a div
[11:45:36] <BillCriswell> Nevermind, google didn't bring me to that with whatever I tried first.
[11:45:46] <rhizome> it's a spelling interface, like [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] each with one letter
[11:45:54] <trick2g> how do i get the value of a button when i click o nit
[11:45:56] <trick2g> on it
[11:46:20] <robertmaxrees> trick2g $(this).val() or this.value within your event handler.
[11:46:42] <trick2g> won't work
[11:46:48] <mortal1> does parent(sel) only go up one level?
[11:46:49] <trick2g> i have a <button name="post_id" value="{{ post.id }}"> like this
[11:47:01] <trick2g> with different ids
[11:47:11] <trick2g> how do i get the id of the button i clicked and store it?
[11:47:25] <robertmaxrees> this.id
[11:47:36] <BillCriswell> mortal1: Yes.
[11:47:59] <trick2g> i have a text box i need to put it into though
[11:47:59] <trick2g>  <input type="text" name="id" value="{{ post.id }}" />
[11:48:01] <trick2g> like that
[11:48:32] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ trick2g
[11:48:32] <b-ot> trick2g: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:48:46] <trick2g> there is no jquery code.
[11:48:59] <robertmaxrees> but there's html, yeah
[11:49:14] <trick2g> i pasted the two parts that are relevant
[11:49:25] <BillCriswell> rhizome: Are you running this after you modify the inputs by hand?
[11:49:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/
[11:49:39] <robertmaxrees> trick2g so when you click the button in that fiddle, what are you expecting to happen?
[11:49:42] <BillCriswell> [value=""] would only select an element if the value was empty when the page was loaded.
[11:50:43] <trick2g> robert: store the value of the id in a variable so i can return it on a pop up
[11:51:14] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yeah dude get right on that.
[11:51:26] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[11:51:56] <trick2g> do you know how robert? i don't really know jquery i'm using bootstrap.
[11:52:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:52:04] <robertmaxrees> which ID?
[11:52:14] <trick2g> the id the button the user clicks
[11:52:21] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have an ID right now.
[11:52:23] <trick2g> which is the also the id of the post
[11:52:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean the value?
[11:52:37] <trick2g>  value="{{ post.id }} returns the id
[11:52:42] <trick2g> in django
[11:52:48] <robertmaxrees> that's the value of the attribute, not the ID in html
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/1/
[11:53:15] <robertmaxrees> might want to check out learn.jquery.com to familiarize yourself with some of the basics of the library :)
[11:53:57] <BillCriswell> rhizome: Does that make sense with only being able to use attribute selectors on the attribute value when the page loads?
[11:55:47] <robertmaxrees> IE8's handling of the conditional is funny.
[11:56:03] <mortal1> Am I also correct that .find only returns the first thing it finds, and there is no findAll?
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> .find() does everything it finds.
[11:56:17] <robertmaxrees> all children that match that selector.
[11:56:34] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what just .find() would return haha
[11:56:43] <BillCriswell> Kind of curious now.
[11:57:04] <mortal1> well, find('li') seems to only return the first li, leaving it's siblings out in the cold
[11:57:19] <robertmaxrees> that'll get all LIs that are children of the selected element.
[11:57:32] <mortal1> but I suppose i could just find('ul')
[11:58:03] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/6xE9H/
[11:58:04] <BillCriswell> .children('li') would only grab first level, .find('li') would go as deep as it needs.
[11:58:25] <robertmaxrees> ,find() without a selector gets you nothing
[11:58:38] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Haha yeah I saw that.. don't know what I was expecting.
[11:59:06] <mortal1> 42 ...I expected 42
[12:00:30] <alester> I can't figure why my autocomplete widget is not sending output to the <div> that I want it to.
[12:00:32] <alester> https://gist.github.com/petdance/15cb96eeb8fcb2a88638
[12:00:50] <alester> The data populates correctly as specified in _renderItem and _renderMenu
[12:01:02] <trick2g> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/3/ why doesn't it return a value?
[12:01:16] <alester> but it's not getting added to div.ccsstag_search_content.  Instead, the standard autocmoplete menu appears over it.
[12:01:32] <robertmaxrees> trick2g because <script>document.write(banID)</script> doesn't work
[12:01:43] <trick2g> what's wrong?
[12:01:44] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to write out a value that doesn't yet exist there.
[12:01:54] <trick2g> it should exist when you click the button
[12:02:03] <robertmaxrees> then you need to append that data inside your click handler
[12:02:20] <trick2g> how would i do that?
[12:02:49] <robertmaxrees> by running your logic inside your click handler...? http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/4/
[12:03:56] <trick2g> i don't want to print the value when i click it though.
[12:04:04] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to.
[12:04:14] <trick2g> how do i store it and return it?
[12:04:31] <rhizome> BillCriswell: i have it working in one case now, thanks. the values do change, but i'm using delegation so that appears to maybe sortof enable me to place the cursor at the first empty unchanged field
[12:04:32] <robertmaxrees> you're already storing it in that example.  you likely don't want to return it.
[12:04:50] <decx> return a button value on click?
[12:04:54] <trick2g> i need to return it in a popup...
[12:05:04] <trick2g> so i know the id the post..
[12:05:30] <BillCriswell> rhizome: You'd have to do something like $('input').filter(function(){ return this.value === ''; }).eq(0)
[12:05:31] <rhizome> BillCriswell: i'm using the filter technique from here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1299468/135845
[12:05:32] <trick2g> id of the post
[12:05:36] <decx> sounds like data to me
[12:05:38] <rhizome> jinx!
[12:05:45] <robertmaxrees> trick2g so on click, you want to show a modal with that ID?
[12:05:53] <trick2g> yes!
[12:05:59] <robertmaxrees> okay - what modal are you using?
[12:06:11] <trick2g> some bootstrap modal?
[12:06:14] <trick2g> the default one
[12:06:24] <BillCriswell> alester: appendTo vs appendto? Just a shot in the dark haha.
[12:06:38] <BillCriswell> alester: Looking at it a bit more now though.
[12:06:43] <robertmaxrees> okay - i have to head out on lunch, trick2g, but do you know how to launch the bootstrap modal as-is?
[12:06:56] <BillCriswell> alester: Looks like that might be it actually!
[12:07:12] <alester> well, it certainly changes how it fails. :-)
[12:07:15] <trick2g> robert: it loads by itself
[12:07:22] <BillCriswell> alester: Bonus round!
[12:07:23] <alester> Thank you for finding the incredibly obvious.
[12:07:41] <robertmaxrees> trick2g if you use people's full usernames their clients will notify them btw.
[12:07:43] <BillCriswell> alester: I got lucky haha
[12:07:47] <robertmaxrees> and not sure what you mean.
[12:07:49] <trick2g> i know
[12:07:54] <trick2g> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/
[12:07:59] <trick2g> i used the example
[12:08:06] <trick2g> it loads by itself when you run it
[12:08:25] <alester> Now it's failing in jquery-ui itself with a "this.menu is undefined"
[12:09:04] <robertmaxrees> trick2g okay... not following.  you just have to change the post id in the modal body...
[12:09:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost about where you're confused.
[12:09:21] <trick2g> ...huh?
[12:09:51] <trick2g> the modal always loads the last id. that's the problem
[12:10:10] <trick2g> i want the id of the post i selected by clicking on a button.
[12:10:29] <BillCriswell> alester: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-appendTo anything to do with the note here?
[12:10:40] <BillCriswell> alester: I haven't played with autocomplete too much.
[12:10:57] <decx> typeahead is better anyway
[12:10:58] <robertmaxrees> trick2g i'm having a real hard time following at this point, sorry!
[12:11:45] <alester> BillCriswell: If I understand correctly, the appendTo is only getting passed into the constructor(?) at line 19.
[12:11:55] <trick2g> all i need to know is how to get the value of the button i clicked and return it in a separate form
[12:12:03] <alester> or are you talking about the appendTo on line 36 that is a methdo call?
[12:12:09] <trick2g> do you know how?
[12:12:51] <BillCriswell> alester: I was just wondering if it had something to do with the note for the "suggestions" menu thing.
[12:13:06] <decx> put it in a var trick2g ?
[12:13:21] <trick2g> yep and how do i return it
[12:13:27] <decx> wat?
[12:13:34] <alester> Right.  But I don't think that the "suggestions menu is open" when the constructor call is made.
[12:13:42] <trick2g> how do i write it as html?
[12:13:47] <trick2g> document.write...what
[12:13:51] <decx> wat?
[12:14:09] <trick2g> so banid contains the value 9
[12:14:10] <xxx1337> What is the correct syntax to place this variable?  "margin-top": '-=' + zoomheight'
[12:14:19] <trick2g> how do i print it in html
[12:14:32] <trick2g> <script>document.write(banID)</script>  doesn't work.
[12:14:37] <decx> xxx1337 that should do it
[12:14:48] <robertmaxrees> trick2g right, because that's just shoving the value out without waiting for it to exist.
[12:14:52] <robertmaxrees> i showed you how earlier.
[12:14:57] <BillCriswell> alester: Yeah I was totally guessing.
[12:15:08] <alester> Hey, you hit 100% on the appendto. :-)
[12:15:11] <trick2g> the modal loads after you clickthe button robert..........
[12:15:14] <trick2g> so it should exist
[12:15:26] <BillCriswell> I'm at 50%. Good odds.
[12:15:32] <robertmaxrees> trick2g but that script tag runs before you click the button
[12:15:37] <trick2g> i know.
[12:15:43] <trick2g> so how do i run it aftre
[12:15:44] <xxx1337> decx: you sure? I'm getting an error on that line
[12:15:44] <trick2g> after
[12:15:48] <robertmaxrees> trick2g you don't.
[12:15:58] <trick2g> so what am i going to do ;-;
[12:16:00] <decx> xxx1337 well i'm not sure ^^
[12:16:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/4/ this does exactly what you think the other one does.
[12:16:14] <trick2g> how do i reload it
[12:16:18] <trick2g> after the button has been clicked
[12:16:19] <trick2g> that would work
[12:17:12] <xxx1337> nevermind it is working
[12:17:19] <xxx1337> but the value was 0 which threw me off
[12:17:20] <robertmaxrees> trick2g i think what you really want is more akin to this: http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/6/
[12:17:27] <decx> just checked it and yes xxx1337
[12:17:33] <xxx1337> how do I get the value of a div's height and store it in a variable?
[12:17:42] <decx> but you can also access the existing value inside that function
[12:17:51] <robertmaxrees> var theDivHeight = $('#someDivId').height();
[12:18:14] <decx> .css('height',function(i,height){ return height + newheight })
[12:18:22] <xxx1337> thats what i have i think but im getting 0 robertmaxrees hmm
[12:18:27] <trick2g> that returns the value when you click the button though robertmaxrees
[12:18:34] <decx> in that context i is for the implied each and height is the current computed height
[12:18:39] <trick2g> i want to return  it in the modal
[12:19:15] <trick2g> as in input value like <input type="text" name="id" value="" />
[12:19:54] <robertmaxrees> trick2g i'm not 100% sure how bootstrap's modal works, but you'll probably have to target the modal body and edit that.  iirc it might even have a way to dynamically build a modal.
[12:20:41] <trick2g> ;_;
[12:20:52] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for somebody to build this for you?
[12:21:06] <trick2g> no i built it all myself i just don't know jquery
[12:21:11] <trick2g> it's in python/django
[12:21:20] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com - this will get you started :)
[12:21:28] <trick2g> it should be simple though
[12:21:29] <trick2g> like 2 lines..
[12:21:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:21:36] <robertmaxrees> it's going to be more than that.
[12:21:46] <decx> i still dont know what's going on
[12:22:01] <decx> a button that doesnt open a modal but saves something for a modal?
[12:22:13] <robertmaxrees> i guess?
[12:22:28] <trick2g> the button opens the modal automatically
[12:22:41] <robertmaxrees> so you want to open the modal and have it display something.
[12:22:47] <trick2g> yes..
[12:22:51] <trick2g> it's a ban thing
[12:22:57] <trick2g> i need the id of the post
[12:23:17] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-usage start here.
[12:23:57] <trick2g> obviously i read that
[12:24:08] <Jagst3r21> hmm, shouldnt this work? $(".main-ad").show("slide", { direction: "up" }, 1000);
[12:25:23] <Jagst3r21> full code here: http://hastebin.com/edajuhacax.js
[12:25:31] <BillCriswell> Jesus.
[12:25:35] <decx> isnt the modal content on the page? just change whatever you want there?
[12:25:57] <BillCriswell> I am so confused right now.
[12:26:25] <BillCriswell> Well.. mostly I feel like a crazy person.
[12:26:40] <BillCriswell> I feel like everyting I know about javascript is wrong.
[12:26:46] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: isn't that your normal state of mind?
[12:26:47] <trick2g> decx: i can't change it
[12:26:53] <robertmaxrees> trick2g why not?
[12:27:01] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: More so than usual.
[12:27:10] <trick2g> when i put the post id in the modal itself it only loads the last post id
[12:27:17] <robertmaxrees> how are you doing that?
[12:27:26] <trick2g> because it was the last one returned
[12:27:47] <rhizome> hmm, i addClass to an field, but then chaining .focus() puts the cursor in the wrong field
[12:28:04] <BillCriswell> I'm adding some elements to the DOM way way way before I run a function that does something with those nodes, but the function does not see them and I have no idea why.
[12:28:30] <trick2g> {{ post.id }} dynamically loads the post id, robert. put since modal loads after the page it always returns the last post id loaded
[12:28:33] <trick2g> it's complicated.
[12:28:37] <rhizome> BillCriswell: $(document).on(...)?
[12:28:47] <robertmaxrees> trick2g it's not complicated - your javascript/html should be pretty easy.
[12:29:02] <trick2g> you say it's easy..how do i do it?
[12:29:05] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: http://duckie.me/ !
[12:29:52] <BillCriswell> rhizome: It's two separate files, both call the init in $(document).ready(init);
[12:29:59] <robertmaxrees> trick2g which part are you getting stuck on, specifically?
[12:30:07] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: HAha nice.
[12:30:30] <trick2g> loading the post id
[12:30:38] <BillCriswell> rhizome: If I put a setTimeout(function(){ }, 0); it works just fine, which is really confusing me.
[12:30:45] <trick2g> so i put into a hidden input field so i can submit it in a form
[12:31:05] <trick2g> otherwise idk what post the user clicked on.
[12:31:15] <Zzaichik> those elements are probably not being added to the DOM on/before page load
[12:31:27] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: browsers paraller loading messes up the order?
[12:31:49] <robertmaxrees> trick2g you can setup your javascript differently to make that work, but i'm lazy.  one sec.
[12:31:50] <rhizome> BillCriswell: hum, not sure about that one. maybe the dual inits?
[12:32:14] <BillCriswell> I think I'm expecting these $(init)s to run in order. Not sure that's happening.
[12:32:21] <alester> BillCriswell: Would this new "use strict" have saved me from that appendTo typo?
[12:32:30] <trick2g> k
[12:32:42] <rhizome> i would expect sad times if i tried to do something like that, but i wouldn't know why
[12:32:55] <BillCriswell> alester: I have no clue to be honest.
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> trick2g this should give you the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/9/
[12:33:43] <BillCriswell> Zzaichik: Yeah, that's definitely happening but I'm not sure how.
[12:36:38] <trick2g> robert: close but that will replace the whole modal?
[12:36:45] <robertmaxrees> trick2g that's not perfect obviously - i'd switch that up to initialize and then show only after the text has been changed.
[12:36:49] <robertmaxrees> it's only an example duder
[12:37:06] <robertmaxrees> and with that i leave for lunch.  remember to tip your waitresses folks.
[12:37:32] <Zzaichik> hmmm
[12:39:02] <trick2g> too complicated for me to figure out ;-;
[12:44:19] <BillCriswell> Holy shit.
[12:44:27] <BillCriswell> I am an idiot.
[12:44:45] <BillCriswell> Well... someone changed something on me without me knowing, but I should have looked closer haha.
[12:54:00] <hpekdemir> hi all
[12:54:11] <hpekdemir> the $.inArray function does not work with the first element in my array
[12:54:19] <hpekdemir> is this normal behavour?
[12:54:53] <BillCriswell> hpekdemir: > 0
[12:54:59] <BillCriswell> > -1 I mean
[12:55:24] <hpekdemir> hmm works
[12:55:27] <hpekdemir> so what did I do here?
[12:55:32] <BillCriswell> $.inArray(1, [1,2,3]) would return 0, which is falsey, so test > -1 to see if it exists.
[12:55:44] <hpekdemir> ok
[12:57:22] <hpekdemir> so why the return value of 0 if first element of array matches in the first place?
[12:57:41] <adv_> is there a way to watch whaen background-size css property changes and take some action?
[12:57:46] <adv_> when*
[12:57:57] <BillCriswell> hpekdemir: zero based index.
[12:58:11] <hpekdemir> I see.
[13:03:11] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[13:03:15] <BillCriswell> Everything is bothering me today.
[13:06:22] <Zzaichik> Mondays are funtimes
[13:07:24] <Zzaichik> You know it's a good day when it gets to the point that the little things colleagues do become incredibly bothersome.
[13:11:41] <adv_> i'm trying to get this to work http://darcyclarke.me/dev/watch/
[13:12:02] <adv_> 	$('img').watch('background-size', function(){    console.log('foo3');});
[13:12:11] <adv_> doesn't seem to work, but no errors
[13:13:31] <BillCriswell> adv_: Is it a fluid element?
[13:13:41] <adv_> BillCriswell: what is a fluid element?
[13:13:49] <BillCriswell> Is it 100% width?
[13:13:56] <BillCriswell> like of the window?
[13:14:02] <BillCriswell> Trying to figure out why you'd need to do this.
[13:14:20] <BillCriswell> That watch plugin just crashed chrome on me.
[13:14:45] <adv_> i'm on chrome too
[13:15:08] <adv_> BillCriswell: i'm using http://www.jacklmoore.com/wheelzoom/ and i want to change the width whenever the user zooms in
[13:15:22] <adv_> so i want to watch background-size and modify width accordingly
[13:17:21] <BillCriswell> adv_: So basically every time a scroll happens?
[13:17:27] <adv_> BillCriswell: yes
[13:20:38] <BillCriswell> adv_: I think $('img').on('mousewheel', function () { /* Zooming */ }); would do the trick.
[13:21:26] <BillCriswell> adv_: I might actually just modify this plugin to do what I need..
[13:21:50] <adv_> no just tried
[13:21:51] <BillCriswell> adv_: On line 127 here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmoore/wheelzoom/master/jquery.wheelzoom.js there's a updateBgStyle() function call. I'd add my own and do what Ineed to probably.
[13:23:19] <adv_> BillCriswell: hm .. good idea but i'm not sure this will be faster than modifying the css style
[13:23:28] <adv_> faster for dev i mean
[13:23:59] <adv_> i actually want to increase the img container to grow as the zoom increases , not stay fixed
[13:25:10] <dglambert> so I have this snippet of code to deactivate the a tags
[13:25:56] <dglambert> $('a').click(function (event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[13:26:05] <dglambert> But I want to do something with the href
[13:26:13] <dglambert> how do I reference it inside the function?
[13:26:31] <alester> What do you want to do with the href?  Just modify it?
[13:26:53] <dglambert> I am going to do some ajax
[13:27:06] <dglambert> to replace the content of a div
[13:27:56] <dglambert> I just want to make sure I get that specific href rather than all hrefs
[13:28:31] <robertmaxrees> dglambert the clicked link?
[13:28:35] <dglambert> yes
[13:28:38] <robertmaxrees> $(this)
[13:28:43] <robertmaxrees> that's the link that you clicked.
[13:29:33] <dglambert> does it need to be like $(this).("href")
[13:29:41] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('href')
[13:31:39] <dglambert> so I am trying to pass href to get
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> store it and pass it through.
[13:32:00] <adv_> BillCriswell: any ideas?
[13:32:07] <trick2g> robert i can't get that code to work at all
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> trick2g use my full screenname and my client will autonotify me ;)  and I had it working just fine.
[13:33:19] <dglambert> I have $.get($(this).prop('href'), function(data){function(data){$('#widget').html(data);}}
[13:34:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> only need one function in there - http://jsfiddle.net/574KN/
[13:34:59] <BillCriswell> adv_: I'd alter the plugin.
[13:35:11] <adv_> BillCriswell: can you help with that?
[13:35:33] <BillCriswell> I can't right now. 25 minutes till home time and I need a beer.
[13:35:42] <robertmaxrees> rough day?
[13:36:28] <BillCriswell> Girlfriend is just irking me today to be honest haha.
[13:36:38] <robertmaxrees> i hear that.
[13:37:32] <adv_> BillCriswell: tomorrow? should i shoot you an email ?
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> woah what's going on here?
[13:38:33] <BillCriswell> adv_: I like to keep things in IRC haha. If you're around tomorrow I should be able to help if someone here can't help you now.
[13:38:45] <adv_> ok thanks
[13:38:51] <adv_> guys :)
[13:40:52] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[13:45:46] <banister_> hi, is there a way to use $.parseHTML() so that it's a little more strict and doesn't allow broken fragments like: "</p><p> ?
[13:46:12] <robertmaxrees> banister_ that's valid if it's used in context.
[13:46:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:47:11] <dglambert> hey robertmaxrees I am still having problems getting get to work
[13:47:24] <dglambert> theHref is working though, I checked it with an alert()
[13:47:25] <robertmaxrees> dglambert what does your console/net panel say?
[13:47:32] <banister_> robertmaxrees hmm, is there a way to get parseHTML to use strict xhtml style?
[13:47:38] <robertmaxrees> banister_ nope.
[13:47:46] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of, at least.
[13:47:52] <banister_> robertmaxrees what if the html is invalid? parseHTML just returns [] ?
[13:47:55] <dglambert> oh hold on I think I see whats happening
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> btw use console.log() instead of alert()
[13:48:53] <trick2g> robertmaxrees: the modal doesn't update at all
[13:49:00] <robertmaxrees> trick2g the example I shared does.
[13:49:08] <robertmaxrees> without seeing what you're doing, it's hard to help.
[13:49:13] <trick2g> your example doesn't load anything else though.
[13:49:33] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* i could make it change the ID.
[13:51:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/10/
[13:51:17] <adv_> anyone?
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> adv_ that's going to be a little more involved than most are going to want to get into.
[13:52:48] <dglambert> ugh I am having SOP problems
[13:53:07] <dglambert> same-origin policy
[13:53:13] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.  CORS.
[13:53:33] <dglambert> yeah I have already done some fixing for that
[13:53:46] <dglambert> but I have a * for access-control-allow-origins
[13:54:14] <rsalisbury> is this the channel for jquery mobile as well?
[13:54:18] <trick2g> robert: do i put the top bit in <script> tags at the top of the page?
[13:54:20] <robertmaxrees> rsalisbury yep.
[13:54:29] <robertmaxrees> trick2g what "top bit"?
[13:54:42] <robertmaxrees> trick2g put your javascript in the script panel, not in the HTML panel/.
[13:55:08] <robertmaxrees> dglambert should be  Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[13:55:40] <dglambert> yeah sorry typo
[13:56:03] <dglambert> the funny thing is its working onload fine
[13:56:23] <rsalisbury> hahaha once again I answered my own question by trying to formulate it
[13:56:24] <trick2g> in my script the $('button').on('click', function() part
[13:56:34] <trick2g> do i put in script tags at the top of my page?
[13:56:43] <rsalisbury> thanks for providing a forum for me to ask a question that I can answer myself =)
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> rsalisbury :) that's half the point!
[13:57:02] <robertmaxrees> trick2g you should put those in an external file.
[13:57:13] <dglambert> I am actually already making that get call
[13:57:29] <trick2g> but it should work in script tags?
[13:57:32] <robertmaxrees> you should then either reference that file right before your closing body tag, or wrap the contents in a doc ready and put it somewhere in your head after the jquery include.
[13:57:58] <robertmaxrees> if you put it above your page content, it should work as long as you've got it wrapped in a doc ready.
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> *assuming you aren't doing anything else funky.
[13:58:12] <trick2g> >you've got it wrapped in a doc ready.
[13:58:16] <trick2g> what does that mean?
[13:58:28] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com explains it pretty well :)
[13:58:46] <trick2g> i think bootstrap overwrites your code
[13:58:53] <trick2g> nothing happens at all
[13:58:58] <dglambert> is that intended for me robertmaxrees ?>
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> my code will never work if you don't wrap my js in a document ready.
[13:59:18] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Good luck.
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> or you put it after everything else in the page
[13:59:39] <dglambert> ?
[13:59:49] <trick2g> $(document).ready(function() { that?
[13:59:53] <robertmaxrees> trick2g yes.
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> wrap that around the JS i supplied
[14:00:31] <rsalisbury> okay, one thing I am quite lost on though: I am using a JSON file to load translated text into a mobile page; While it loads the text correctly, when it does so on pages other than home, it resizes the buttons.  Any idea what might be causing this?
[14:00:43] <rsalisbury> note: I did not write the HTML or CSS =D
[14:01:02] <trick2g> still doesn't do anything ;_;
[14:01:13] <robertmaxrees> trick2g any errors in your console?
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> it's nearly impossible for me to help without seeing what you're doing.
[14:01:38] <kegster> anyone have any luck renaming media files? i found a plugin but man that's scary... haha
[14:01:40] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a great place for you to start.  if you keep having issues, fixingthesejquery.com is another fantastic resource.
[14:02:18] <trick2g> no there isn't
[14:02:29] <adv_> :/
[14:02:42] <robertmaxrees> trick2g dunno what to tell you then mano.  it's super hard to help without seeing it all in action.
[14:02:43] <rsalisbury> trick2g you're putting the script in the header, not the body, right?
[14:02:49] <trick2g> obviously
[14:03:03] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter where you put it if you wrap it in a doc ready ;)
[14:03:08] <trick2g> what if i pasted more of the code robert
[14:03:18] <robertmaxrees> please use my full screenname btw.
[14:03:33] <robertmaxrees> and i aksed for that a few hours ago and you tried to tell me that it wasn't relevant.
[14:05:33] <trick2g> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/zaYby3FA
[14:05:46] <robertmaxrees> trick2g can you give me the rendered html instead please?
[14:07:09] <robertmaxrees> and btw - http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/11/ works just fine.
[14:09:00] <trick2g> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/6bXPjQ2X
[14:09:01] <trick2g> not for me.
[14:09:10] <robertmaxrees> does it work in the fiddle?
[14:09:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/12/ <- with your rendered output.
[14:10:06] <trick2g> no...
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:10:38] <robertmaxrees> i just tested in IE, FF, and Chrome - they all work.
[14:10:49] <trick2g> i want the post id to show up in  <input type="text" name="id" value="" />	
[14:10:52] <trick2g> inside a text box
[14:10:57] <trick2g> also nothing at all shows
[14:10:59] <trick2g> it just loads
[14:11:02] <trick2g> i don't see any post id
[14:11:22] <robertmaxrees> then change the target.
[14:11:44] <trick2g> how?
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> $('#BanModal').find('.modal-content').text(banID); obviously this is not what you want.
[14:12:07] <trick2g> right
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> so change it to what you want.
[14:12:26] <trick2g> <input type="text" class="modalid" name="id" value="" />	
[14:12:28] <Zzaichik> .text() or .val()
[14:12:33] <robertmaxrees> .val() in his case.
[14:12:34] <trick2g> $('#BanModal').find('.modalid').text(banID)
[14:12:37] <trick2g> should work?
[14:12:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> you want to change the specific input - how would that line ever find that input?
[14:13:00] <trick2g> modal-content is a class though
[14:13:12] <robertmaxrees> you only have one on that page.
[14:13:22] <robertmaxrees> you have to find the child of modal-content that has what you want.
[14:13:39] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com covers this sort of stuff for you.
[14:13:42] <robertmaxrees> it's like CSS>
[14:13:46] <trick2g> it's in modal-body...
[14:14:07] <robertmaxrees> right now, oyu're trying to change the text of .modalid" - that is obviously not what you want.
[14:14:11] <trick2g> i don't want to spend ages learning jquery for one simple thing, you know?
[14:15:17] <rsalisbury> robertmaxrees: do you use an IDE or just a text editor?
[14:15:32] <robertmaxrees> rsalisbury sublime Text 2 right now.
[14:15:35] <Zzaichik> var yourChildElement = $('.child-element').val();     then give that variable to the $(input).val()
[14:16:01] <trick2g> i do want to change the text of modalid though.
[14:16:19] <robertmaxrees> trick2g then you need to explain what you want in more detail.
[14:16:23] <robertmaxrees> you want to change 2 things?
[14:16:40] <trick2g> <input type="text" class="modalid" name="id" value="" /> should say the post id when rendered
[14:16:52] <rsalisbury> that looks pretty sweet
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> that is not what you just said btw.
[14:17:16] <trick2g> ..what did i say?
[14:17:22] <robertmaxrees> you were talking about some class.
[14:17:23] <rsalisbury> visual studio is being a pain in the ass for this HTML/jQuery stuff =P
[14:17:24] <robertmaxrees> not that input.
[14:17:29] <robertmaxrees> trick2g http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/13/
[14:17:34] <trick2g> no i pasted that input earlier
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> rsalisbury i never liked VS personally
[14:17:36] <trick2g> scroll up
[14:17:47] <robertmaxrees> trick2g i'm aware, but then you kept saying something about an unrelated class.
[14:17:52] <robertmaxrees> please see the fiddle i just pasted.
[14:18:06] <rsalisbury> I'm doing most of my work in C# and ASP so it's good for that
[14:18:14] <rsalisbury> when you have intellisense
[14:18:31] <robertmaxrees> rsalisbury ah, yeah.  i worked at a .NET shop a while ago - i liked intellisense.  as long as you use MS everything, it's amazing.
[14:18:49] <rsalisbury> the funny thing is, I don't even have windows on any of my home computers =D
[14:19:10] <robertmaxrees> i work in a mostly mac shop these days.
[14:19:15] <trick2g> robertmaxrees: thanks that works
[14:19:25] <trick2g> the question is will it be sent through a post request..
[14:19:36] <robertmaxrees> dunno - depends on how you're building the post.
[14:19:44] <rsalisbury> I'm usually a linux guy, heh
[14:19:52] <robertmaxrees> rsalisbury i'm on windows right now.
[14:20:27] <trick2g> the answer is...no
[14:20:33] <trick2g> well that was a waste of time
[14:20:40] <trick2g> gonna have to figure out something else ;-;-;
[14:20:41] <trick2g> kill me
[14:20:47] <robertmaxrees> trick2g not at all - you canb manually craft the post body yourself.
[14:20:53] <Jattenalle> trick2g, ok
[14:20:57] <trick2g> what do you mean?
[14:21:19] <robertmaxrees> you can create an object and send that over.
[14:21:40] <robertmaxrees> though if you're ajaxing over the form and setting an inputs value, that should work just fine/
[14:21:49] <robertmaxrees> or even just normally posting the form.
[14:21:53] <trick2g> the input still shows up blank though
[14:21:57] <trick2g> in the source
[14:22:04] <robertmaxrees> well yeah
[14:22:06] <robertmaxrees> that's the page source.
[14:22:07] <trick2g> only in the browser does it show the value
[14:22:15] <robertmaxrees> right.  the page source doesn't matter.
[14:22:16] <trick2g> so the page source matters..
[14:22:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:22:26] <robertmaxrees> the page source doesn't take JS into account.
[14:22:29] <trick2g> how do i send it over a post form then if it's blank
[14:22:37] <robertmaxrees> you're not sending that over.
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> you're sending over the DOM version of the page.
[14:22:56] <robertmaxrees> or form, rather.
[14:22:58] <trick2g> the form isn't ajax...?
[14:23:07] <trick2g> it's a regular html form.
[14:23:31] <robertmaxrees> the page source doesn't update when you manipulate it with JS.
[14:24:29] <trick2g> so can you give an example of how i'd send it?
[14:24:41] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/Lw82m/ see this?
[14:24:52] <robertmaxrees> isn't there an ajax tutorial on learn.jquery.com
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ yep.
[14:27:53] <trick2g> how do i change it
[14:28:02] <trick2g> $('#modalid').val(banID); something like that
[14:28:08] <robertmaxrees> change what?
[14:28:22] <robertmaxrees> the page source will not update.  not sure how else to put that.
[14:28:25] <trick2g> the input value of modalid to the id so it sends over a post request
[14:28:35] <robertmaxrees> .val() will update the field fine.
[14:28:41] <decx> duch
[14:28:43] <trick2g> but will it send over a post request?
[14:28:46] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[14:28:54] <decx> duch_kazatel would have scoffed like 3 hours ago
[14:29:01] <trick2g> ;-;
[14:29:02] <robertmaxrees> i know :(
[14:29:07] <robertmaxrees> trick2g read the tutorial.
[14:29:09] <trick2g> we're so close robert.
[14:29:12] <decx> memories like the corners of my mind
[14:29:21] <trick2g> don't give up on old trick2g
[14:29:46] <robertmaxrees> i've given you resources and you refuse to use them.  hell, i asked you to use my full screenname and you won't even do that.
[14:30:36] <trick2g> i am using it man why do i have to type it every time?
[14:31:43] <trick2g> you haven't told me a way to make it so the post id sends over a post request.
[14:32:01] <robertmaxrees> if the input is a child element of the same form as the button, it'll just work.
[14:32:12] <robertmaxrees> so make sure you have a valid form i guess?
[14:32:21] <robertmaxrees> decx build anything neat today?
[14:33:07] <decx> na i have to do work
[14:33:32] <trick2g> it doesn't work though.
[14:33:34] <kara_sweets> 	$(".form").bind('ajax:success', function() {};
[14:33:40] <kara_sweets> is there a way to retrieve the associated data
[14:33:49] <kara_sweets> using the bind method on ajax:success?
[14:33:58] <kara_sweets> the response
[14:34:05] <uskerine> function(data)
[14:34:05] <uskerine> ?
[14:34:14] <trick2g> furthermore $('#BanModal').find('input[name="id"]').val(banID); changes other values too
[14:34:15] <kara_sweets> thats what i was trying but it was logging undefined
[14:34:28] <kara_sweets> data was logging undefined
[14:34:40] <kara_sweets> my servers returning json
[14:34:57] <kara_sweets> format.json { render json: @bid, status: :created, location: @bid }
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> kara_sweets you want $(document).on('ajaxSuccess', function(data) {}); maybe?
[14:35:47] <uskerine> I don't know about binding
[14:35:47] <kara_sweets> robertmaxrees: thats what i thought but when i log data i see undefined, but its getting success on server
[14:35:49] <hpekdemir> so I want to check if there are 5 elements in my array which are named "a", "b",...etc. how can I do this?
[14:35:53] <uskerine> it is not the same as your case, but in case it helps
[14:35:54] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/CUi0ty5t
[14:36:01] <trick2g> fuck it all
[14:36:03] <uskerine> I use success and response
[14:36:14] <kara_sweets> uskerine: ya I'm starting to think maybe use that instead of bind
[14:36:15] <robertmaxrees> kara_sweets rather $(document).ajaxSuccess();
[14:36:26] <hpekdemir> if ( $.inArray("a", arr) && $.inArray("b", arr) ) { ...?
[14:36:32] <robertmaxrees> .bind() was deprecated a while ago.
[14:36:50] <robertmaxrees> the events are global, too, not from the form.
[14:36:52] <hpekdemir> but I always need a if ( $.inArray("a", arr) > -1  && $.inArray...
[14:37:24] <kara_sweets> how do you read the data object/
[14:37:44] <uskerine> you mean the response?
[14:37:46] <kara_sweets> yea
[14:37:49] <uskerine> is that JSON?
[14:37:57] <kara_sweets> yea
[14:38:01] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(data){event, xhr, settings});
[14:38:13] <robertmaxrees> $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(data){event, xhr, settings, data});
[14:38:14] <uskerine> I think it would be just response.objectname
[14:38:40] <robertmaxrees> woops - $(document).ajaxSuccess(function(event, xhr, settings, data){}); this is the full method signature
[14:39:00] <kara_sweets> so data.id?
[14:39:07] <kara_sweets> if it had an id attribute
[14:39:08] <uskerine> if you are receiving an id field, yes
[14:39:23] <uskerine> try also before that to alert(data)
[14:39:30] <uskerine> alert(data.toSource()) (i think only works in firefox)
[14:39:38] <uskerine> so you can check that you are actually receiving the data
[14:39:41] <kara_sweets> logging shows [object Object]
[14:39:50] <uskerine> try .toSource()
[14:39:51] <uskerine> under firefox
[14:39:56] <uskerine> it converts the object to text
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> hpekdemir http://api.jquery.com/has/
[14:40:02] <uskerine> also enabling debugging helps
[14:40:08] <robertmaxrees> instead of inArray
[14:40:12] <kara_sweets> don't have firefox
[14:40:32] <uskerine> I guess chrome has also debugging windows
[14:40:37] <uskerine> I use FIREBUG and that .toSource()
[14:40:38] <uskerine> for debugging
[14:40:42] <uskerine> but that requires FIREFOX obviously
[14:41:27] <uskerine> alert(data.id) should work too
[14:41:38] <robertmaxrees> avoid using alert() - use console.log() instead.
[14:41:48] <uskerine> why should we avoid using alert?
[14:42:06] <robertmaxrees> it halts execution of the page which can have various side effects on script execution.
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> also, the console lets you dump through objects.
[14:42:35] <robertmaxrees> instead of getting that generic [object Object] message
[14:42:39] <uskerine> I think alert is useful many times
[14:43:01] <systemfault> Also… fugly
[14:43:12] <robertmaxrees> i would disagree - console is a much better choice when writing and debugging scripts.
[14:43:15] <systemfault> That's the last thing I would like to show to a user.
[14:43:35] <uskerine> I mean
[14:43:36] <hpekdemir> robertmaxrees: thank you.
[14:43:37] <robertmaxrees> also - you shouldn't leave console.log() in your code.
[14:43:38] <uskerine> while debugging
[14:43:40] <uskerine> :)
[14:43:49] <systemfault> console.log is superior in every way
[14:44:18] <uskerine> an alert is difficult to forget
[14:44:28] <uskerine> but whatever
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> then setup a linter to check your file before you commit :)
[14:44:55] <Prometheian> I'm doing a bunch of jQuery butchering of some HTML code for a rush job at work (not good, I know but constraints). I'm building a new <tr><td> area and my boss wants bullet lists. However I've stuck a <ul></ul> around it but it isn't rendering the bullet list. I think this might be because of IE, anyone happen to know a good workaround?
[14:45:10] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian do what now?
[14:45:21] <Prometheian> sec and I'll post code
[14:45:32] <robertmaxrees> Prometheian you have to use <ul><li></li></ul> for lists.
[14:45:45] <Prometheian> Yeah, sorry. I have li's wrapped around the things
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> but they're still in that table?
[14:45:54] <Prometheian> Chrome will render <li> without a <ul> but IE doesn't like that
[14:46:04] <Prometheian> yeah it's all wrapped in a tr td
[14:46:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah a paste would be helpful.
[14:46:42] <Prometheian> Warning: This code is UGLY
[14:46:49] <Prometheian> http://www.hastebin.com/facarocode.xml
[14:47:22] <Prometheian> Basically I have to pull a bunch of crap from everywhere and because the damned thing was written terribly I get tons of whitespace.
[14:47:33] <Prometheian> So I can't use even/odd indexes to figure out stuff.
[14:47:41] <hpekdemir> robertmaxrees: how I can I use .has() for a text?
[14:47:45] <hpekdemir> an array I mean.
[14:48:01] <systemfault> Prometheian: What is that "M' weird condition?
[14:48:10] <robertmaxrees> hpekdemir hrm?  i thought you were looking to see if an object has an element?
[14:48:22] <Prometheian> Each line will have feedback text and the person who entered it + timestamp
[14:48:27] <Prometheian> Timestamps end in AM/PM
[14:48:28] <hpekdemir> robertmaxrees: yes. If an array has an element named "foo"
[14:48:43] <Prometheian> So I look for that to know it's the end of that line
[14:48:45] <robertmaxrees> hpekdemir arrays don't have named indexes. what kind of object are you searching throuhg?
[14:49:07] <hpekdemir> I have a table with several rows
[14:49:22] <hpekdemir> I want to check if 5 defined string (by me) are in these tds
[14:49:43] <systemfault> Prometheian: You could make something simpler… If I understand correctly.
[14:49:44] <robertmaxrees> then you want :contains()
[14:50:00] <hpekdemir> I say $('#foo tbody').find('td:nth-child(3)').filter(function() { arr.push ( $(this).text() })
[14:50:01] <Prometheian> Pray tell. I have strict requirements on how this "looks" t.t
[14:50:08] <hpekdemir> just to able to do the check afterwards
[14:50:17] <hpekdemir> If 5 string are within that array
[14:50:33] <robertmaxrees> hpekdemir then use :contains()
[14:50:36] <hpekdemir> ok
[14:50:42] <nitrospectide> What's the best way to run some jQuery commands if the mobile style sheet in my responsive design is the only sheet being used (they are below the threshold for tablet or desktop)?
[14:50:55] <robertmaxrees> you cannot run JS from CSS.
[14:51:10] <nitrospectide> Is it window width, or is there a better way?
[14:51:16] <systemfault> Prometheian: You could do something like: var newFeedback = '<li>' + $.map(feedbacks, function(fb) { return fb.trim(); }).join('</li><li>')  + '</li>';
[14:51:48] <Prometheian> Okay, but I don't think that will fix my issue w/ IE not showing the UL
[14:52:31] <systemfault> Prometheian: Is the website online?
[14:52:42] <robertmaxrees> nitrospectide you can test if the viewport is at a certain size.
[14:52:48] <Prometheian> I'm working on my local machine, let me see if I can make a test fiddle.
[14:54:24] <Prometheian> yeah IE 8 won't even load jsfildd
[14:54:27] <Prometheian> fiddle*
[14:54:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:54:32] <decx> robertmaxrees, systemfault i'm practicing and trying to write a simple highlighter but i cant for the life of me figure out the logic of the duplicationbug that happens after the first hit, mind checking that out? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Mx87Q/
[14:55:13] <systemfault> decx: Looking
[14:55:28] <Prometheian> Ah.. so it works if I just do... http://www.hastebin.com/zejiwajapo.xml
[14:55:33] <Prometheian> but not my bs
[14:55:34] <Prometheian> hum
[14:57:53] <Prometheian> I swear to god this damned html -> pdf bullshit runs in IE8.
[15:01:57] <cubud> I'm reading a book which is currently explaining how to write a single-page-app using jQuery, It is telling me that instead of retrieving a Json array of Product to display in my html table it is better to return a list of IDs and then have the page issue an individual HTTP request for the details of each item. Is this good advice? Seems counter intuitive to me.
[15:02:35] <uskerine> No it is not
[15:02:38] <robertmaxrees> entirely depends on your needs.
[15:02:39] <uskerine> better retrieve them at once
[15:02:55] <robertmaxrees> one at a time is great because you can start rendering things one at a time.
[15:03:04] <cubud> It's just displaying a list of all products
[15:03:16] <robertmaxrees> how early in the book are you?
[15:03:22] <uskerine> you are overloading the server and increasing the bandwidth by doing that
[15:04:40] <robertmaxrees> something tells me later on you'll want to have that enpoint setup.
[15:05:07] <cubud> P218 - but it's a book about the Play framework in Scala, and this is just an introduction
[15:05:45] <robertmaxrees> wasn't looking for a specific page, more like "the beginning" or "a section about X topic" - sounds like they'll build on that later.
[15:10:50] <systemfault> decx: Is that it? http://jsfiddle.net/Mx87Q/2/
[15:11:31] <decx> i-act !
[15:11:37] <decx> yes, thank systemfault
[15:57:26] <o88sun> hi
[15:57:47] * jphase waves
[15:58:11] <jphase> pfft hehe
[16:08:19] <s2ky> , youtube.com/skywayinc
[16:08:57] <cjwelborn> jquery amateur question, I've been checking to see if my queries have returned anything like this: var x = $('mything'); if (x.length && (x.length > 0)) { dostuff() }     ...is there a better way to see if the query returned something, or anything?
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to check?
[16:10:03] <cjwelborn> one of my elements is only created under a certain circumstance. If it's not available I don't want to try to do anything with it (it's a checkbox)
[16:11:30] <robertmaxrees> jquery does that under the hood for you in many cases, but you can just do if (x.length) {}
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> no need to check if it's greater than 0.
[16:11:57] <cjwelborn> robertmaxrees: thanks, that's what I needed. I forgot about (0 == false) for a minute. duh..
[16:21:44] <adv_> i can do img.width to get the width, how do i get left ? img.left won't do it
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> $(img).offset().left
[16:22:46] <robertmaxrees> if that's what you mean.
[16:27:11] <adv_> robertmaxrees: yeah thanks!
[16:36:42] <kara_sweets> is there a way to detect which button was clicked on a apge?
[16:36:54] <kara_sweets> is the best thing to do add a click handler to the entire documnet?
[16:40:47] <jphase> kara_sweets: you can do that, sure
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> you can use a delegated listener, too.
[16:49:45] <kara_sweets> I'm having problems with scope
[16:58:19] <trick2g> i'm not giving up robertmaxrees
[17:01:15] <robertmaxrees> can you share your whole page?
[17:01:42] <jphase> kara_sweets: you still having issues? want to post a jsfiddle.net post if you are?
[17:02:00] <trick2g> the whole page?
[17:02:03] <kara_sweets> ywere about to find out
[17:02:16] <robertmaxrees> trick2g or a more indicative example of what you're now trying to do.
[17:02:22] <kara_sweets> this is as much of rails issue as query issue
[17:02:29] <kara_sweets> jquery*
[17:02:33] <trick2g> i'm still trying to do the same thing
[17:02:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:03:02] <kara_sweets> i still need to check which button is being pressed on a page
[17:03:06] <kara_sweets> haven't solved that yet
[17:03:23] <kara_sweets> $(document).click(function(){  // return clicked button });
[17:03:27] <kara_sweets> something like that
[17:03:31] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[17:03:43] <trick2g> robertmaxress, how do i get the id to send through post?
[17:03:51] <trick2g> without using ajax
[17:03:51] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', 'button', function() { /* $(this) is the clicked button */ });
[17:03:52] <kara_sweets> will this work?
[17:04:07] <kara_sweets> robertmaxrees: perfectemundo
[17:04:08] <kara_sweets> thank you
[17:04:11] <robertmaxrees> trick2g by making sure the input is a child of the form.
[17:04:38] <trick2g> it is, it appends the input inside the form yet doesn't send.
[17:05:17] <kara_sweets> is there a method via ajax callbacks to find which form submitted an ajax request
[17:05:46] <jphase> kara_sweets: just pass some id as a value in the ajax request
[17:05:58] <robertmaxrees> trick2g then bummer.  no idea.  you sure your server is setup correctly?
[17:06:00] <kara_sweets> jphase: ajax request is being handled by rails
[17:06:16] <jphase> hmm, but the front end portion needs js/jquery
[17:06:17] <kara_sweets> so not writing the .ajax method which would be easier IMO
[17:06:24] <trick2g> robertmaxrees yes because if i try a different variable it sends.
[17:06:30] <kara_sweets> theres a little rails magic going on
[17:06:31] <jphase> oh like the js part is being generated
[17:06:33] <jphase> oic
[17:06:39] <kara_sweets> i can only bind ajax callbacks
[17:06:44] <robertmaxrees> trick2g "if I try a different variable it sends" - show me please.
[17:07:01] <jphase> kara_sweets: well if it's a callback then just pass in another param into your callback function
[17:07:30] <jphase> I mean, honestly I won't know because I don't know rails to save my life - I'd have to view source kara_sweets
[17:08:44] <trick2g> robertmaxrees  if i type  return HttpResponse(request.POST.get('duration')) instead of get('id') it prints the value of duration but not the id
[17:08:51] <trick2g> meaning it's not being sent.
[17:09:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:10:09] <robertmaxrees> is that from the python end of things?
[17:10:14] <robertmaxrees> can you show me your form with js?
[17:11:03] <kara_sweets> heres my issue in a nutshell
[17:11:03] <kara_sweets> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/966a6fadaa48b1abdc8a
[17:13:11] <trick2g> robertmaxrees http://pastebin.com/qvH7jbyL
[17:14:01] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah that's an easy one.
[17:14:08] <robertmaxrees> you're submitting before the element gets appended.
[17:14:20] <kara_sweets> robertmaxrees: me?
[17:14:24] <robertmaxrees> no trick2g
[17:15:33] <trick2g> i don't think i am
[17:15:45] <robertmaxrees> trick2g i'm telling you that's what's happening.
[17:15:45] <trick2g> if it shows up then surely it's appended
[17:15:51] <trick2g> why does it show up then?
[17:15:59] <robertmaxrees> because browsers are funny things.
[17:16:06] <trick2g> so how do i fix it
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> first off you want to bind to the submit event of the form, not the click event of the button.
[17:17:23] <robertmaxrees> then run preventDefault() agaist the submit's event object.
[17:17:36] <robertmaxrees> append your data, then submit your form.
[17:17:49] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to distinguish between real and synthetic events, but that shouldn't be too hard.
[17:18:19] <trick2g> could you write some code to test it?
[17:18:32] <robertmaxrees> i can help you write your code.
[17:18:36] <robertmaxrees> i have done this before ;)
[17:19:02] <jphase> hey veeta
[17:24:28] <trick2g> robertmaxrees are you writing the code?
[17:24:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:24:47] <robertmaxrees> i will help you write yours.
[17:24:52] <robertmaxrees> i am not going to write it for you.
[17:24:57] <trick2g> ;_;
[17:25:09] <robertmaxrees> this is a support channel, not a "ask and ye shall recieve" channel.
[17:25:29] <trick2g> if i try to write something will you fix it
[17:25:36] <robertmaxrees> i will help you fix it, yes.
[17:25:39] <robertmaxrees> i will not fix it for you.
[17:30:08] <trick2g> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/k1Rmnqii i tried and failed
[17:30:11] <trick2g> what did i do wrong
[17:30:31] <robertmaxrees> you did the first part.
[17:30:44] <robertmaxrees> and the second part.
[17:30:50] <robertmaxrees> now you have to submit the form.
[17:31:44] <trick2g> $( "#ban_form" ).submit(); ?
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> what do you think will happen when you do that?
[17:32:21] <trick2g> doesn't work
[17:32:42] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're running preventDefault() against the event.
[17:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you have to figure out if the event was synthetically triggered or not and go from there.
[17:33:42] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, iirc you have a 2 stop process - one opens the modal and the other submits the form.  append the input on the first step and avoid the nonsense in this second step.
[17:34:45] <trick2g> what does synthetically triggered mean
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> (don't do it this way - append the input when you open the modal it'll be 500000 times easier)
[17:35:20] <trick2g> uh..
[17:35:31] <trick2g> edit the bootstrap code.. :\
[17:35:33] <robertmaxrees> "synthetically" in this case means "submitted programatically and not via a user clicking the button"
[17:35:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:35:41] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to do that broseph.
[17:35:46] <robertmaxrees> i showed you how to do this earlier.
[17:35:57] <trick2g> do an onclick on the ban button?
[17:36:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> append the input when you launch the modal.
[17:36:26] <trick2g> can't it launches magically
[17:36:39] <robertmaxrees> i showed you how to do this earlier broseph
[17:36:42] <trick2g> can you give me an example of how i'd do it?
[17:37:02] <trick2g> it already appends when i launch the modal anyway
[17:37:04] <trick2g> it didn't work
[17:37:11] <robertmaxrees> okay, then let's fix that problem.
[17:38:29] <trick2g> ..ok?
[17:38:46] <robertmaxrees> can't help you if you don't show me that code.
[17:39:12] <trick2g> i already pastebined it?
[17:39:23] <robertmaxrees> which one?  because it's obviously not the most recent one.
[17:40:02] <trick2g>  http://pastebin.com/qvH7jbyL
[17:40:10] <trick2g> that appends it when you launch the modal
[17:40:16] <trick2g> but doesn't submit through post
[17:40:43] <robertmaxrees> because you're appending to .modal-body, not the form.
[17:40:46] <trick2g> actually it should say .append
[17:43:48] <robertmaxrees> do you see the problem?
[17:44:27] <trick2g> maybe but the whole thing's broke so wait
[17:46:53] <trick2g> finally it works
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> see what you did wrong?
[17:47:06] <trick2g> i appended it outside of the form, yeah..
[17:47:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:47:18] <trick2g> boy i'm a dumbass
[17:47:21] <robertmaxrees> nah, you're not.
[17:47:28] <robertmaxrees> you just need to slow down and cover the basics.
[17:49:40] <trick2g> wait it's still work
[17:49:42] <trick2g> broke
[17:49:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.  how?
[17:50:00] <trick2g> it works if i do $('#ban_form').append('<input type="text" class="id" name="id" value="400'"/>');
[17:50:03] <trick2g> but not if i do
[17:50:03] <trick2g> $('#ban_form').append('<input type="text" class="id" name="id" value="' + banID + '"/>');
[17:50:16] <trick2g> minus the ' beside the 400
[17:50:33] <robertmaxrees> any errors in the console?
[17:51:10] <trick2g> no
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> re-paste into pastebin please.
[17:51:53] <robertmaxrees> what you now have I mean.
[17:52:44] <trick2g> http://pastebin.com/xrt2FSYT
[17:54:00] <robertmaxrees> try to add a type="hidden" into those attributes.
[17:54:13] <trick2g> what difference would that make
[17:54:26] <trick2g> if it works witth value="5"
[17:55:16] <robertmaxrees> just replace the current type and try.
[17:55:29] <robertmaxrees> it's semantically correct anyway, so you should do it that way in the first place.
[17:56:10] <trick2g> doesn't work
[17:56:19] <trick2g> i do it as a text so i can see if it appears or not
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> can you update the jsfiddle from earlier?
[18:02:05] <trick2g> {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[18:02:06] <trick2g> :/
[18:02:35] <trick2g> what does that mean
[18:02:46] <trick2g> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/17/
[18:03:32] <robertmaxrees> that part wont work in the fiddle  that's OK.
[18:03:44] <robertmaxrees> bt you didn't do what I just asked you to do.
[18:03:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/16/ this is closer.
[18:04:49] <trick2g> maybe it would be better to store the post id in a cookie?
[18:04:58] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:05:25] <robertmaxrees> you have some invalid html going on one sec.
[18:06:40] <robertmaxrees> you have an extra closing div tag: http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/18/
[18:07:45] <trick2g> so what's the problem?
[18:07:55] <trick2g> it shows up fine..
[18:07:58] <robertmaxrees> you had an extra closing div tag.
[18:08:06] <trick2g> won't change anything.
[18:08:10] <robertmaxrees> oh okay
[18:08:18] <robertmaxrees> welp apparently i don't know what i'm doing and you don't need my help.
[18:08:30] <trick2g> the real problem why it won't post with banID...
[18:08:45] <robertmaxrees> because you have that extra closing div tag maybe - try removing it and see.
[18:10:30] <trick2g> it's not that.
[18:10:42] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so you replaced your markup with what i posted there?
[18:11:25] <trick2g> yes i deleted the extra div
[18:11:35] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then there's something I'
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> *i'm not seeing in your code.
[18:13:07] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting one field with that value and then appending another with that value?
[18:14:06] <trick2g> so there's not two input ids
[18:14:22] <robertmaxrees> why can't you get that data out of one of them?
[18:14:46] <trick2g> instead of appending is there a way to replace html?
[18:14:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:15:10] <robertmaxrees> you're also setting the value of that input, rendering this whole append thing moot.
[18:15:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/JDP4F/19/
[18:15:35] <robertmaxrees> that should work.
[18:16:47] <robertmaxrees> i have to head home.
[18:17:14] <trick2g> unforunately not.
[18:17:28] <robertmaxrees> so you need the same value sent over twice?
[18:17:37] <robertmaxrees> something seems very strange here.  i wish you the best of luck.
[18:17:59] <trick2g> when will you be back?
[18:18:03] <robertmaxrees> tomorrow
[18:18:06] <trick2g> ;-;
[18:20:00] <robertmaxrees> good luck mano.
[18:20:07] <trick2g> ffffffff

[20:37:45] <frozenyogurt> hey all having a weird issue with slideDown and border
[20:38:08] <frozenyogurt> if you go to this site
[20:38:09] <frozenyogurt> http://lanshindev.herokuapp.com/about
[20:38:12] <frozenyogurt> and click readmore
[20:38:18] <frozenyogurt> you can see the issue in action
[20:39:31] <jphaser> frozenyogurt: what's the issue? how it sorta hops up for a second?
[20:39:37] <hd1> does jquery support gzip decompression or am i looking in the wrong place for this functionality?
[20:39:52] <frozenyogurt> there are black lines that go on the way down
[20:40:36] <jphaser> hd1: no that'd typically be a server side language
[20:41:03] <jphaser> frozenyogurt: what browser are you using?
[20:41:11] <frozenyogurt> chrome on mac
[20:41:20] <frozenyogurt> os x
[20:41:22] <jphaser> hm, me too and the black border seems to stay
[20:41:56] <frozenyogurt> weird
[20:42:22] <frozenyogurt> can anyone else check it out?
[20:42:24] <Uhkis> looks fine on win+ff
[20:42:32] <frozenyogurt> sweet
[20:42:37] <frozenyogurt> hmm
[20:42:43] <Uhkis> except for the hop on the start
[20:42:45] <jphaser> frozenyogurt: do a hard refresh to be sure
[20:42:50] <jphaser> cmd + shift + r
[20:42:57] <jphaser> yeah I get the hop
[20:43:03] <jphaser> but the border is visible the whole time for me
[20:44:22] <frozenyogurt> how could i remove the hop?
[20:44:44] <jphaser> usually a clear both element at the bottom of that container
[20:45:13] <Uhkis> the hop is cause by the instant removal of the read more link
[20:45:25] <jphaser> ahh yes,
[20:45:26] <frozenyogurt> gotcha
[20:45:30] <frozenyogurt> kk thanks guys for the help
[20:45:34] <frozenyogurt> gonna fix this
[20:45:37] <jphaser> don't remove, use visibility hidden :D
[21:46:33] <sammych> this is so frustrating, valid jQuery vertical selection widget is not enhancing correctly
[21:47:03] <sammych> it breaks when one of the checkboxes are checked
[21:49:04] <sammych> oh. I found it, there are dupe elements being made with the same for-label-id elsewhere
[21:55:51] <hd1> what's wrong with "$.getJSON('http://hasan.d8u.us/links.py.cgi?format=json', null, function(data) { return(data); });"?
[21:58:41] <Uhkis> nothing
[22:00:52] <Uhkis> but i guess you want something like: var sSsSs; $.getJSON('http://hasan.d8u.us/links.py.cgi?format=json', null, function(data) { sSsSs = data }
