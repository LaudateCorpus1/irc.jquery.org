[01:38:30] <ph88> nFFF: i just checked with someone else ... who got it working on his FF ... perhaps it's a firefox add-on blocking here
[01:38:47] <ph88> gonna disable my add-ones and enable them one-by-one ^^
[01:38:49] <ph88> be back later
[01:39:05] <nFFF> ecky--ptang-zoob, should work?

[01:54:54] <[E]sc> i'm trying to append results in a form of a link from autocomplete to a contenteditbable div, much like how twitter/facebook does a drop down name list. however, it's not appending the right results. any suggestions?
[02:22:22] <mrHAT> <tr> <td> <a>how do i get the parent <tr> ?</a> </td> </tr>
[02:23:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This is the id of the textarea: id='ta_quickcomment_51d779436c676' - and in the jquery code I do $("#ta_quickcomment_51d779436c676").text("");; and it does not empty the textarea...
[02:24:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is there something wrong with the ID?
[02:27:52] <mrHAT> .parents("tr") ?
[02:37:00] <omegak> Hi, I'm trying to get jquery-ui sortable containment working with overflow:auto, but I found something that I believe is a bug. I would appreciate if I can get some feedback before I open a ticket.

[03:11:02] <Mackwerk> Hey, I think I'm going retarded. This should return 97, but instead it puts the numbers next to each other like it's interpolating a string?: Math.floor((maxVal/100)*20)+maxVal
[03:13:55] <imduffy15> Hi. I want to use $.ajax to make a request and set a true or false based on the result it gets. This true or false is later used for picking what screens are hidden/shown. At the moment the if statement for the showing of the screens seems to be getting executed before the ajax call finishes. How can I fix this? I've set async: false but that didn't work.
[03:13:57] <Mackwerk> Nevermind, I am a retard :o
[03:23:06] <fella5s> imduffy15, make a function that executes what ever logic is needed and add that as your success function?
[03:27:33] <imduffy15> fella5s: like this? https://gist.github.com/imduffy15/903836dcabf0cbb72638
[03:30:09] <fella5s> that does not work
[03:30:39] <kai> imduffy15: I don't thing ajax() with async: false does what you think it does
[03:30:48] <kai> and the return that way sure doesn't
[03:31:52] <imduffy15> fella5s kai just got it working :-) Thank you. https://gist.github.com/imduffy15/903836dcabf0cbb72638
[03:31:54] <kai> imduffy15: so I think the proper way to do it is to use a callback for isLdapEnabled() that then contains whatever you want to do if ldap is enabled
[03:31:58] <obenns> Can anyone tell me why ie7 hates this little bit of code? http://pastebin.com/XC6JJwa8 God I hate ie...
[03:32:11] <obenns> it doesnt apply a margin top at all
[03:32:26] <kai> ok, I guess that works as well
[03:33:16] <slax0r> obenns, does it ignore the code, or the margin-top?
[03:34:20] <kai> but I still think it's nicer to say function ifLdapEnabled(callback) { ... $ajax({.... success: function(json) { if (ldapconfigwhatever) { callback() } }, ...})... }
[03:34:31] <obenns> slax0r: If I set a value instead of the variable it works fine
[03:34:36] <obenns> So it's something to do with the selector
[03:35:01] <slax0r> yeah it is
[03:35:09] <slax0r> header is html5, i7 is barely html4
[03:35:15] <slax0r> ie7*
[03:35:36] <slax0r> I bet it doesn't work on ie8 as well, and maybe even not on ie9
[03:36:20] <slax0r> read this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5227331/html5-new-elements-header-nav-footer-not-working-in-ie
[03:36:26] <slax0r> don't know if it will work for ie7
[03:36:34] <obenns> slax0r:No it works on IE8. and dam i totally forgot about that. let me try a class
[03:36:54] <obenns> slax0r: pretty sure jQuery handles it though
[03:38:13] <slax0r> jquery might handle it yes, but it's height in ie7 is probably 0, try to alert it
[03:39:26] <obenns> slax0r: no it alerts it fine :S
[03:39:33] <slax0r> so, height is there?
[03:39:37] <slax0r> hum
[03:40:02] <slax0r> where did you alert it? right before you're using it?
[03:40:11] <slax0r> so, in setMainPos?
[03:41:12] <obenns> slax0r: Yeah, which is why i don't understand what the issue could be as I'm pumping the value into the fucntion
[03:41:21] <obenns> slax0r: I've done before, after and inside the function
[03:42:58] <slax0r> weird...and format is ok?
[03:43:16] <obenns> slax0r: Yeah, it throws up no errors on the console either
[03:45:00] <obenns> obenns: I can upload it to my server if youd like?
[03:45:28] <obenns> slax0r: I can upload it to my server if youd like?
[03:47:51] <slax0r> obenns, yeah please
[03:50:15] <Maximilian> hello jQuery experts :) I'm working on a plugin using the http://de.jqueryboilerplate.com/ pattern. My question is: how can i expose methods to be calle from outside the plugin like $('awesomeElement').wonderfullPlugin('greatMethod','superArgument')
[03:54:49] <reloadz> hi! can anyone tell me why this script works in chrome, but not in ff? http://jsfiddle.net/qTekH/
[03:55:00] <reloadz> work*
[03:56:10] <slax0r> relipse, ff doesn't support background-position-x
[03:56:29] <reloadz> ok! thx... so how can I get arround it?
[03:57:25] <slax0r> use 'backgroundPosition':'Xpx Ypx'
[03:57:43] <slax0r> should work on all browsers that support bg positioning
[03:57:51] <obenns> slax0r: www.oliverbenns.com/new_site
[04:05:56] <reloadz> slax0r: 'background-position':'0px 0px' don't work and 'backgroundPosition':'Xpx Ypx' also XD am I doing it wrong?
[04:06:54] <slax0r> replace X and Y with numerical values...
[04:08:59] <reloadz> dude! abcourse i did that :D
[04:09:18] <reloadz> i just copied your msg XD
[04:10:34] <reloadz> no response!
[04:11:18] <obenns> http://javascript.gakaa.com/style-backgroundposition.aspx
[04:12:55] <obenns> slax0r: Not sure u got this msg but I uploaded it: www.oliverbenns.com/new_site i'll wait till u sort out that other guy :) I appreciate it
[04:15:37] <seutje> obenns: your scripts.js contains modernizr, which needs to be in the <head> and it contains stuff that needs to run either at the bottom of the page or at document.ready
[04:15:52] <seutje> oh wait, didn't notice the document ready, lol
[04:16:09] <obenns> seutje: haha :P
[04:19:01] <slax0r> obenns, oh sorry, didn't see it
[04:19:13] <slax0r> will get on it in a minute
[04:19:18] <Maximilian> any idea?
[04:19:27] <obenns> slax0r: Thanks dude, no worries
[04:20:15] <slax0r> reloadz, try to set the backgroundPosition first, and then animate it, I think it needs to be set first
[04:22:44] <Maximilian> hm
[04:25:16] <mrHAT> is this performance kill : http://pastebin.com/d0BUE5cg ??
[04:26:37] <obenns> mrHAT: wrap it all in a function and use a parameter ? :)
[04:27:19] <mrHAT> what do you mean ?
[04:27:19] <slax0r> don't you just love it when IE freezes? -_-
[04:27:55] <obenns> slax0r: Dont get me started on IE mate :P
[04:27:59] <slax0r> obenns, hm, it works for me on IE7...
[04:28:34] <obenns> slax0r: so the 'about' content is below the splash header?
[04:28:44] <slax0r> yup
[04:28:50] <obenns> slax0r: whattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
[04:29:06] <slax0r> but it's an IE10 with IE7 mode
[04:29:32] <obenns> slax0r: ah im using ie9 with ie7 mode
[04:30:10] <obenns> slax0r: doesnt seem to be working in ietester either
[04:30:18] <slax0r> the best would be if you could get a real ie7 browser and test it that way
[04:30:35] <slax0r> I have an old computer at home with ie7 on, I can test it there, but I'm at work now...
[04:30:55] <obenns> slax0r: I'll get a XP img and boot it on VMWare
[04:32:19] <obenns> mrHAT: So create a named function that has some sort of parameter, e.g. function hello(para1) { etc } . then call that function with the element as the parameter
[04:33:18] <mrHAT> obenns you do realize the reason why i used on() right ?
[04:34:41] <obenns> mrHAT: Yeah but why have 3 seperate on clicks when u can wrap it all in a function and just call it
[04:35:43] <obenns> mrHAT: Oh i see dw
[04:35:46] <mrHAT> call if from where dude
[04:36:00] <mrHAT> i am binding a click event on some dinamically added elements to the dom
[04:36:01] <mrHAT> wtf
[04:41:24] <qom2> is it possible to run a selection like this: $('#projects article.curr').find('section').not(':first'); and then reverse the order of the fetched elements?
[04:55:36] <b0ss_> hi I'm trying to add selected values from a <select> into another <select>. I'm doing like this [ http://pastebin.com/qh2W48P3 ] but it's adding the multiple selected values all at once in a single row in the second <select>. Any guess ?
[04:56:13] <seutje> qom2: $('#projects article.curr').find('section').get().slice(1).reverse()
[04:56:33] <seutje> note that returns a regular array of DOM elements, not a jQuery collection
[04:58:19] <seutje> qom2: if u want a jQuery object, either use Array.prototype.reverse.call or use $.fn.reverse = Array.prototype.reverse; like so: http://jsfiddle.net/4VjdB/
[04:58:30] <qom2> which one is it I can run eq on?
[04:58:39] <seutje> jquery collections
[04:58:43] <seutje> the lattetr
[04:58:46] <seutje> latter*
[04:59:12] <seutje> qom2: http://jsfiddle.net/4VjdB/1/
[04:59:20] <seutje> should only log the last one
[05:00:49] <qom2> ah, seems to work alright, thanks :)
[05:02:05] <qom2> but don't think I'm doing this by the books, haha
[05:03:04] <seutje> b0ss_: can't  seem to reproduce: http://jsfiddle.net/wEvGr/
[05:03:24] <seutje> (changed the first text() to attr('value') though, but that doesn't seem to matter
[05:04:09] <slax0r> seutje, .val()
[05:04:09] <qom2> http://pastebin.com/dKuibqi1 – when you've reached the end of my slider, I want to rewind to the start, so right now I check for the previous slides (excluding the first) and then I animate them so they scroll by and then I have a special case for the first slide (not implented yet, so that it animates to top: 0)
[05:04:16] <qom2> is there an easier way?
[05:04:17] <scrupul0us> hello, is there an async alternative to using .each() ?
[05:04:22] <seutje> slax0r: not what I'm after
[05:05:07] <slax0r> well, .val() gets attribute value
[05:05:10] <b0ss_> seutje: check that out again, please. I've updated it.
[05:05:20] <b0ss_> it's still the same I just wrote
[05:07:51] <seutje> qom2: if u want a continuous scrolling, you'll need to append the first element to the end once it's out of view
[05:08:28] <qom2> hm, alright, I'm just questioning my own method here, as it seems like it's rather complex for a quite easy task
[05:16:02] <Maximilian> ok I'll ask again, maybe someone can help me. I'm working on a plugin using the http://de.jqueryboilerplate.com/ pattern. My question is: how can i expose methods to be calle from outside the plugin like $('awesomeElement').wonderfullPlugin('greatMethod','superArgument')
[05:19:01] <nds_> Im trying to select every other <td> like this to put in a border, but for each <tr> it does not restart the td:odd counter.  $("tr").children("td:odd").addClass("border"); I want to have a border on every other <td>. This would be fine if i would only have 1 <tr>.
[05:21:53] <slax0r> nds_, $('tr').each(function(){$(this).children('td:odd').addClass('border');});
[05:21:55] <obenns> nds_: Hey, is there a reason for using .children? Could you not just use tr td:odd as one selector?
[05:22:14] <seutje> obenns: children excludes children of children
[05:22:14] <obenns> nds_: or am I being a noob (im good at that)
[05:22:24] <obenns> seutje: Ah!
[05:22:26] <seutje> children != find
[05:22:34] <seutje> if it was find, u'd be right
[05:22:39] <nds_> ty!
[05:23:06] <obenns> seutje: I like keeping this chat on my second monitor, I just pick up things :D
[05:23:30] <seutje> I just alt-tab during DB dumps and such :P
[05:24:15] <seutje> Maximilian: usually u see plugins take either an object with settings, or a string as the command to be run, and usually, they just check to see if the first argument was a string
[05:24:24] <seutje> if so, try to interpret it as a function
[05:24:51] <seutje> like this[arguments[0]](arguments[1])

In the condition that the AJAX request succeeds, the modal closes with $('#progress').dialog('close'); In case of an Ajax error I would like to show a message and have the user click a button to dismiss it. This button doesnt do the work of onclick=closemodal();
[05:46:37] <cruisemaniac> my previous messages landed up as whispers to @chanserv! Sorry about that! didn't notice the whisper option was selected! :(
[05:48:11] <cruisemaniac> why wont the <input onclick=jsfunction()> work?

[06:14:58] <slax0r> hide one and show the other
[06:15:14] <slax0r> best you make a wrapper around each, like a div with id or class
[06:15:16] <rook2pawn> well, id like to stay within the framework
[06:15:25] <rook2pawn> and use the transition classes
[06:15:35] <slax0r> framework?

[07:42:03] <BillCriswell> Guest86507: What do you mean exactly?
[07:42:59] <loincloth> hey all
[07:43:01] <Guest86507> Im using a hover effect on my links using css, however jquery makes it so that the background as an animation that loads coming from the right

[07:46:39] <BillCriswell> Guest86507: Are you sure it's jQuery doing this?
[07:46:50] <BillCriswell> Have you called anythis on $('a') ?
[07:46:53] <BillCriswell> anything*
[07:47:48] <Djim> Hi, folks. I've a problem. I include jquery with <script src=... and then i include my js also with <script src=... and my script somehow can't see jquery. is it normal?
[07:48:29] <BillCriswell> Djim: Make sure you're actually linking to jQuery and it's not a dead link.
[07:49:07] <BillCriswell> Also, be sure you close script tags. <script src="jquery.js"></script><script src="app.js"></script>
[07:49:10] <Djim> one html page links two scripts. jquery first, then mine. I've cheched with firefox's view source and then followed link to jquery and it is there
[07:49:26] <BillCriswell> Djim: Is there an error in the console?
[07:50:54] <Djim> [17:49:33.670] TypeError: $ is not a function produces by my script
[07:51:32] <BillCriswell> Djim: jQuery isn't loaded then.
[07:51:33] <Djim> I want to know one thing. It the way i linked jquery it should be visible right?
[07:52:16] <Djim> If it should be but it's not. I'll try to solve this by myself
[07:52:20] <BillCriswell> Djim: There's a whole lot of details that I'm not sure you should be aware of. If you do <script src="jqueryfile.js"></script> <script src="yourjs.js"></script> you should be good to go.
[07:52:39] <BillCriswell> not sure you would be aware of*
[07:53:06] <Djim> BillCriswell: html script tags generated by django
[07:53:22] <Djim>  BillCriswell: and html is correct
[07:53:32] <BillCriswell> Paste your jQuery script tag.
[07:54:10] <Djim> BillCriswell: <script type="text/javascript" src="/static/admin/js/jquery.js"></script>
[07:54:56] <Djim> BillCriswell: maybe it has something to do with <!DOCTYPE
[07:55:14] <BillCriswell> Do you have it right before </body> or in the <head>?
[07:55:48] <Djim> BillCriswell: html > head > script
[07:56:41] <BillCriswell> In your console go to the "Network" tab and see if the script is doing anything funny.
[07:58:12] <Djim> BillCriswell: I've understood. It is django's admin. It uses jquery but takes it out of global namespace
[07:59:10] <BillCriswell> Djim: The whole thing or just runs noConflict()? What if you use jQuery instead of $ in the script?
[08:00:00] <davesleep> is it possible to get a div to scroll nicely when a button is held?
[08:00:10] <davesleep> and at the same time load images as scrolls?
[08:00:19] <davesleep> ..and do it smoothly in jquery
[08:03:56] <Djim> BillCriswell: nope, no JQuery object in the global scope
[08:04:13] <Djim> BillCriswell: jQuery
[08:05:44] <Djim> BillCriswell: it is in django object. django.jQuery(document).ready(...)
[08:06:03] <Djim> BillCriswell: thank you
[08:06:06] <BillCriswell> Welcoem.
[08:08:30] <DarkGhost`> whats the best way to keep a tab active even after a refresh
[08:08:35] <DarkGhost`> without using php sessions in js?
[08:13:11] <b0ss_> How to get all options of a select using Jquery?
[08:18:15] <b0ss_> How to get all options of a select using JQuery?
[08:19:48] <zeam> if I have a modal pop up on screen that requires jquery, should I re-include the .js files in the content of the modal?  or have the initial page load them all?
[08:21:13] <DarkGhost`> without using php sessions in js?
[08:21:14] <DarkGhost`> whats the best way to keep a tab active even after a refresh
[08:21:50] <BillCriswell> b0ss_: $('select option')
[08:27:29] <designrfix> hi! Quick Question. How can i select all id's that are like this (where * can be any number)    $j('#options_*_2').attr('checked','checked');
[08:27:46] <jax> is there a way to make a placeholder to add <tr>s to a table?
[08:28:30] <jax> or are multiple tbodys allowed
[08:29:17] <BillCriswell> designrfix: You'd have to use filter().
[08:29:54] <designrfix> oh  i see thank you :)
[08:30:09] <BillCriswell> designrfix: Actually, $('[id^=options_][id$=_2]') might work
[08:30:21] <designrfix> trying
[08:31:01] <designrfix> works like a charm    thank you so much!
[08:37:19] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[08:38:16] <\monster\> Hi guys, whats the proper syntax to use an objects method as a handler eg:  var Boo = { moo: function() {} };  $('#hi').click(Boo.moo);  doesn't seem to execute Boo.moo
[08:41:14] <BillCriswell> \monster\: That works. Must be something else going on.
[08:41:19] <shoky> \monster\: it executes Boo.moo but with a different "this". if you want Boo to be "this", you could: $('#hi').click(Boo.moo.bind(Boo))
[08:41:39] <\monster\> hmm
[08:41:45] <DarkGhost`> did anybody ever answer my question? sorry i got disconnected.
[08:42:45] <BillCriswell> \monster\: http://jsbin.com/ukecob/1/edit quick demo.
[08:43:20] <\monster\> weird
[08:45:11] <RabSimpson> hi folks. has anyone here every used retina.js and nivo slider together? i'm getting a bit of a weird bug: http://www.robertsimpson.co.uk/test.htm
[08:45:35] * \monster\ hides under a rock
[08:46:17] * RabSimpson wonders where \monster\ went
[08:46:18] <\monster\> of course I was using the wrong element id
[08:46:35] <DarkGhost`> what is the best way to keep a tab active even after a refresh? without mixing php with js?
[08:47:03] <BillCriswell> \monster\: That's the worst.
[08:47:47] <Guest59289> hi, Thid doesnt seems to be working. http://jsfiddle.net/xHGqX/  any ideas?
[08:48:07] <Guest59289> ref http://jqueryui.com/show/#default
[08:48:14] <clov3r> Darkghost': cookie?
[08:48:26] <DarkGhost`> isntthat still mixing php with js
[08:48:39] <BillCriswell> document.cookies nom nom nom
[08:48:45] <DarkGhost`> oh oh
[08:48:47] <Guest59289> ignore blur though
[08:48:49] <DarkGhost`> ok
[08:48:54] <DarkGhost`> do you think thats the best way?
[08:49:38] <clov3r> well maybe a hashchange or pushstate would be better?
[08:49:44] <clov3r> then you get static urls too...
[08:50:38] <DarkGhost`> well I already did sessions and mixed php with js so w.e lol
[08:50:43] <DarkGhost`> but for next time ! document.cookie
[08:52:55] <clov3r> if (document.location.hash === "second-tab") { $('tab-two').trigger('click'); }
[08:53:52] <DarkGhost`> ive never used hash
[08:54:07] <DarkGhost`> and there is no way to set / edit cookies using jquery without a plugin?
[08:54:18] <clov3r> $('.tab-button').on("click", function() { document.location.hash = $(this).attr('id'); });
[08:54:33] <clov3r> no you can just use raw js for cookies
[08:54:45] <clov3r> google document.cookie
[08:54:58] <DarkGhost`> ok but you're suggesting i use hash?
[08:55:08] <clov3r> or just go here
[08:55:08] <clov3r> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.cookie
[08:55:11] <clov3r> i dunno
[08:55:13] <clov3r> heh
[08:55:16] <clov3r> they're different
[08:55:32] <clov3r> but yeah, i guess i'd recommend hash
[08:55:51] <Guest59289> any help with http://jsfiddle.net/xHGqX/1/      ref http://jqueryui.com/show/#default   ?
[08:56:11] <clov3r> means that you aren't transferring cookies, so you possibly get the most streamlined http requests...
[08:56:14] <clov3r> but its minimal
[08:56:20] <clov3r> whatever's easier really
[08:56:21] <clov3r> :P
[08:56:38] <DarkGhost`> cool
[08:56:40] <DarkGhost`> thank you clone1018
[08:56:42] <DarkGhost`> clov3r*
[08:56:51] <DarkGhost`> oh see
[08:56:53] <DarkGhost`> but theres a problem with the hash
[08:56:59] <DarkGhost`> once you click submit on a post
[08:57:02] <DarkGhost`> it doesn't go back there
[08:57:07] <Quest> shoky,  you around?
[08:57:30] <clov3r> ah sure
[08:57:37] <DarkGhost`> so cookies it is?
[08:57:39] <clov3r> in that case, cookies are probably easier ;)
[08:57:42] <DarkGhost`> lol thanks.
[08:58:19] <clov3r> Guest59289:
[08:58:24] <clov3r> not really sure...
[08:58:33] <clov3r> what are you trying to achieve?
[08:59:13] <DarkGhost`> cookies seem like a bitch
[08:59:16] <DarkGhost`> excuse my language
[08:59:25] <clov3r> they really aren't
[08:59:36] <DarkGhost`> http://privatepaste.com/3cef06ca10
[08:59:39] <shoky> Quest ye
[08:59:41] <DarkGhost`> this is how i'm readig you have to get a cookie?
[08:59:43] <DarkGhost`> oy.
[09:00:17] <Quest> shoky,  oh. sory to disturb you. I just solved my problem
[09:00:33] <shoky> np
[09:00:49] <Quest> shoky,  though I didnt find the anwer to this question since ages. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17869709/jquery-dense-text-shadow-and-blurred-background-color
[09:01:07] <clov3r> darkghost: looks right
[09:02:55] <shoky> Quest: doesn't look fun
[09:03:06] <clov3r> Guest59289: you aren't using .show() correctly
[09:03:16] <clov3r> not sure what the 'clip' parameter is meant to do
[09:04:03] <Quest> shoky,  hm required by me though
[09:04:53] <shoky> what for
[09:11:13] <BillCriswell> It sucks when your best work is private and you're trying to find a job and it makes your resume look bare.
[09:11:50] <RabSimpson> hi folks. has anyone here every used retina.js and nivo slider together? i'm getting a bit of a weird bug.
[09:11:50] <Jabberwock> ++
[09:12:09] <Jabberwock> BillCriswell: Gotta get crafty and create something personal that you can showcase.
[09:12:11] <RabSimpson> *ever
[09:12:19] <Jabberwock> But nothing that you would make money off of
[09:12:55] <BillCriswell> Jabberwock: I've sat down to make a "resume" site or a personal site like 10 times this week. My brain is basically saying "you're not interesting enough"
[09:13:14] <Jabberwock> BillCriswell: Sounds like you could use a vacation to clear your head.
[09:13:19] <Jabberwock> I can totally relate to that feeling.
[09:13:29] <BillCriswell> Jabberwock: That's very true. Would definitely be nice.
[09:13:39] <clov3r> BillCriswell: the resume just gets you in the door
[09:13:48] <Jabberwock> BillCriswell: Do you do anything creative like drawing, photography, graphic design etc?
[09:13:51] <clov3r> you can certainly talk about the work you've done
[09:13:58] <Jabberwock> If you can do something that inspires you, then you can channel that into your work.
[09:14:03] <Jabberwock> That's the best advice I can offer.
[09:14:04] <clov3r> and when it comes down to it, your experience and knowledge will show
[09:14:08] <BillCriswell> I used to draw a lot. Not so much anymore.
[09:14:21] <Jabberwock> Would you like to?
[09:14:25] <BillCriswell> This job ruined my creativity.
[09:14:33] <Jabberwock> I understand.
[09:14:34] <BillCriswell> I like doing HTML, CSS and JavaScript haha
[09:14:35] <BillCriswell> and beer.
[09:14:40] <Jabberwock> lol sounds like me
[09:14:42] <Jabberwock> http://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Right-Side-Brain-Definitive/dp/1585429201
[09:15:01] <Jabberwock> That might stir some confidence in you when you realize that you can still draw well.
[09:15:03] <clov3r> yeah those go well together ;)
[09:15:05] <Jabberwock> Worth a shot.
[09:15:22] <clov3r> hey that's a good book jabberwock
[09:15:28] <Jabberwock> Yeah!
[09:16:00] <BillCriswell> I'll definitely check the book out. I used to draw my own comics and shit before I had the internet. Should get back into it.
[09:16:17] <Jabberwock> Nice.
[09:16:27] <Jabberwock> Yeah it's a great outlet if you're split brained and all you do is code
[09:16:33] <Jabberwock> Gotta keep the creative side from stagnating
[09:17:13] <Quest>  iam using blur.js and jquery movable ui function too on that dive. if I do a .show.clip on that too. the movable funtion does not work.         I have one other dive which is acordian and movable . when I apply .show.clip on it.  the show doesnt works.     what can be wrong?
[09:17:16] <Jabberwock> BillCriswell: And GO EAGLES!
[09:17:30] <Quest> movable == draqgable
[09:17:31] <BillCriswell> Jabberwock: Haha, definitely. Hopefully we accomplish something this year.
[09:17:34] <Quest> shoky, ^
[09:17:44] <Jabberwock> I'm praying. I got a Chip on my shoulder :D
[09:17:48] <Jabberwock> (brb)
[09:17:50] <BillCriswell> Are you from Philly?
[09:17:51] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[09:17:57] <Jabberwock> Yes, near the Trenton border
[09:17:59] <Jabberwock> Levittown
[09:18:06] <BillCriswell> Ah, awesome.
[09:18:17] <Jabberwock> I'm in Orlando working for Disney now but I still claim that I'm am a Philly guy and not a Floridian
[09:18:47] <Jabberwock> Most of my fam is stll up there so they send me Eagles stuff every bday and Christmas lol. I practically have a museum
[09:18:57] <Jabberwock> Nice to chat with another Philly brother.
[09:18:58] <Jabberwock> alright brb
[09:18:59] <BillCriswell> Jabberwock: You can't give up the Philly title.. no matter how much shame it brings.
[09:19:02] <BillCriswell> Ok
[09:19:03] <Jabberwock> Nope!
[09:19:07] <Jabberwock> I bleed green forever.
[09:19:25] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:19:50] <tomivs> Hi for all
[09:20:15] <BillCriswell> Hi for YOU tomivs.
[09:20:37] <tomivs> I want help
[09:21:17] <clov3r> :P
[09:21:25] <clov3r> anything in particular tomivs?
[09:21:26] <tomivs> Please
[09:21:44] <clov3r> i like your approach
[09:21:52] <clov3r> keep it as broad as possible
[09:21:55] <tomivs> I want to update only part of a website
[09:22:07] <BillCriswell> tomivs: The please was implied. Very obvious english isn't your first language.
[09:22:32] <tomivs> But to change the URI
[09:22:46] <tomivs> BillCriswell, Ok
[09:22:58] <tomivs> BillCriswell, I speak spanish
[09:23:07] <clov3r> well updating part of the website is easier than updating the whole thing :P
[09:23:37] <clov3r> tomivs, the URI is usually dependent on your file structure and filename
[09:24:08] <clov3r> but maybe you mean within the website, with javascript?
[09:24:58] <tomivs> clov3r, Yep
[09:25:13] <clov3r> as in: when the user generates some event (such as clicking), the uri updates in the top bar?
[09:25:48] <clov3r> what is the change you would like to make, more exactly?
[09:26:31] <tomivs> clov3r, Don't change the menu and footer
[09:26:40] <clov3r> in general, i think you want to use ajax and pushstate
[09:26:45] <clov3r> ah ok
[09:26:49] <clov3r> so
[09:27:14] <clov3r> if you have your '.container' div (or whatever element you want to update)
[09:27:31] <tomivs> clov3r, YEs
[09:28:02] <clov3r> you can $('.container').load('http://your.url.here/resource', [callback function here]);
[09:28:33] <clov3r> but you might want to do $('.container').load('http://your.url.here/resource 'container *', [callback function here]);
[09:29:08] <tomivs> clov3r, But I need to change the URL
[09:29:08] <clov3r> sorry: actually: $('.container').load('http://your.url.here/resource .container *', [callback function here]);
[09:29:12] <clov3r> ok
[09:29:49] <Andres75> hello can anyone help out with a 3d cube?
[09:29:57] <Andres75> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838548/explanation-of-accurate-measurements-css-3d-cube/17883269#17883269
[09:30:06] <clov3r> then [callback function here] = function() { window.history.pushState(null,null, 'resource') };
[09:30:16] <Andres75> Basically I need it to be 216px wide...
[09:30:30] <Andres75> here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/K99GS/5/
[09:30:40] <clov3r> that will push the new url ("/resource") on to your browsers history stack
[09:31:47] <clov3r> there's a bit better explanation here probably: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/824349/modify-the-url-without-reloading-the-page

[09:32:31] <RabSimpson> hi folks. has anyone here ever used retina.js (wp retina 2x) and nivo slider together? i'm getting a bit of a weird bug: http://www.robertsimpson.co.uk/test.htm
[09:35:23] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: I have not.
[09:37:02] <clov3r> rabsimpson: me either, but what's the bug
[09:37:15] <clov3r> ihaven't noticed anything on firefox
[09:37:29] <clov3r> andres75: just adjust your px dimensions
[09:37:36] <RabSimpson> funnily enough, i think i might've just sorted it by adding max-width: 100%; height: auto; to the images
[09:37:46] <clov3r> i got it to 210px, by changing the smaller width to 186
[09:37:48] <clov3r> http://jsfiddle.net/K99GS/9/
[09:38:04] <clov3r> guess i'll try 188
[09:38:16] <Andres75> but then the content will be all blurred
[09:39:09] <RabSimpson> sorted :D
[09:39:12] <Andres75> because the 3d engine will push it forward
[09:41:41] <clov3r> andres75: ah i see
[09:41:44] <Andres75> if I add translateZ (-108px)
[09:41:51] <Andres75> to the cube it works
[09:42:04] <Andres75> but then the pivot is not centered anymore

[09:45:14] <Jabberwock> We all do.
[09:48:08] <onethfour> is there a jquery_manual.json or .sqlite database including all the functions. I'm trying to make a lookup bot to show function signatures
[09:50:12] <clov3r> v0lksman_: never seen a ~$.inArray(); possibly a typo?
[09:50:16] <Jabberwock> Come again?
[09:50:20] <Jabberwock> onethfour
[09:50:38] <Jabberwock> Oh you're trying to make a jQuery API help bot?
[09:50:50] <Jabberwock> bot-t does it. Not sure who wrote it.

[10:00:58] <Jabberwock> onethfour: I don't know of any. Your best bet may be to do it yourself.
[10:01:20] <clov3r> Bitwise NOTing any number x yields -(x + 1). For example, ~5 yields -6.
[10:01:27] <clov3r> well that's interesting :P
[10:01:54] <clov3r> can't think when i'd use it
[10:02:11] <clov3r> but it'll come up someday, :P
[10:11:32] <c00kiemon5ter> alright, here's my problem; I have a list which is a horizontal navigation top menu. When the screen gets too small, I replace it with a button
[10:11:55] <c00kiemon5ter> I bind click on the button, and when pressed, I toogle the ul.nav (my list)
[10:12:03] <c00kiemon5ter> which now appears vertically
[10:12:25] <c00kiemon5ter> If I press the button again, the list is toggled and thus hidden again
[10:13:01] <c00kiemon5ter> *now* if I make the window big again, the horizontal menu is not shown, as a display:none is there in its style attribute
[10:13:17] <c00kiemon5ter> (.toggle() placed it there)
[10:13:21] <c00kiemon5ter> how do I work around that ?
[10:13:46] <c00kiemon5ter> (I hope it makes sesnse, and was clear)
[10:17:07] <lhunath> can I get moo.css('padding-left') to return a number in px instead of a string?
[10:19:39] <c00kiemon5ter> you either need to get the substring or use parseInt
[10:19:47] <catcher_dev> I'm using .find() to grab a list of elements under a selector.  I need to know how many there are, but .length is giving back the length of each element, rather than the list.
[10:20:10] <catcher_dev> For example, I'm getting "1" 6 times instead of "6" 1 time.
[10:21:25] <lhunath> c00kiemon5ter: mhm.  parseFloat, I guess.
[10:21:42] <c00kiemon5ter> yeah, depending on what you're expecting
[10:21:55] <c00kiemon5ter> take note that parseInt needs the radix too, iirc
[10:22:04] <c00kiemon5ter> parseInt(foo, 10);
[10:23:01] <c00kiemon5ter> catcher_dev, I'm getting the number of elements
[10:23:17] <c00kiemon5ter> ie, $(document).find('p').length; // returns 14
[10:23:18] <BillCriswell> + moo.css('padding-left').replace('px', '')
[10:23:40] <c00kiemon5ter> :)
[10:24:04] <catcher_dev> c00kiemon5ter, must be me, thanks for verifying.
[10:24:50] <dark-sun> hi everyone
[10:25:21] <dark-sun> I was wondering if is it possible to see the user has scrolled up ro down?
[10:25:36] <dark-sun> and how much does she scrolled
[10:27:05] <c00kiemon5ter> dark-sun, try: $(document).scrollTop()
[10:28:55] <BillCriswell> dark-sun: if ( lastScrollPosiiton > nextScrollPosiiton ) { You scrolled up! }
[10:29:15] <c00kiemon5ter> ah, that was an 'or'! :D
[10:29:36] <dark-sun> :D
[10:32:30] <BillCriswell> dark-sun: http://jsbin.com/awepop/1/edit quick demo!
[10:36:13] <dark-sun> thank you BillCriswell that's it :D
[10:36:36] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/awepop/2/edit cleaned it up a bit.
[10:38:11] <zmode> i have a tiny function that calls $.get('someurl'); but it doesn't get executed at all (no request reaches my server) unless i add a call to alert() after $get(). the function is called by onclick= on a submit button. any hints?
[10:40:13] <zmode> i should mention this is jQuery 1.10.2
[10:40:30] <NoiseEee> zmode: crystal ball... fuzzy
[10:40:49] <NoiseEee> zmode: / paste appropriate code to a fiddle, etc
[10:45:33] <BillCriswell> zmode: Anything show up in "Network"?
[10:46:52] <zmode> NoiseEee: this is pretty much it http://jsfiddle.net/uvMzD/
[10:47:24] <zmode> BillCriswell: in my browser logs? no, the request never takes place
[10:48:05] <NoiseEee> zmode: console.
[10:48:10] <NoiseEee> are there error messages in the console?
[10:48:19] <zmode> NoiseEee: no, nothing
[10:48:42] <NoiseEee> you do know that func2 will fire regardless of whether the ajax requests in func1 have finished, right?
[10:48:46] <zmode> the POST requests from func1() do appear, and so does the GET for the page reload
[10:48:47] <NoiseEee> zmode: look up callbacks
[10:48:56] <zmode> NoiseEee: yes i do
[10:49:35] <NoiseEee> zmode: well the code as is doesn't offer much help, but I will advise <tag onSomething='oneFunction(); anotherFunction();'> is not good form / appropriate in 2013
[10:50:42] <zmode> NoiseEee: i'm aware, thanks. this is just a small poc though and i still have no idea how to figure this out
[10:53:18] <BillCriswell> zmode: Might want to look into when http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[10:55:08] <LakWork> anyone in here with paypal api experience?
[10:56:24] <dblosevn> Hey, maybe im just blind but I cant seem to figure out how to make $.mobile.changePage slide left instead of right
[10:57:20] <dblosevn> I tried {direction: 'reverse', transition:'slide'} but that didnt work
[10:58:07] <dblosevn> I cant just use the data attribs in this case because I have to wait on a callback before changing pages
[11:08:07] <dblosevn> guess I was blind lol $.mobile.changePage('index.html', { transition: "slide", reverse: true}, true, true);
[11:09:23] <Sykan> Hello, I've included jquery UI into my webserver. I'm trying to setup the buttonset() method with a set of check boxes from the example provided on the website. I've linked to the css file on the server and can navigate to it via the source. But it seems the style doesn't get connected with the container on the site. I can look at the source and the jquery method does changes Class information to
[11:09:25] <Sykan> Ui-*. The one thing that I can think of is when I downloaded the Source file I had it use a CSS Scope but the method seems to compensate for that. What should I try to resolve this issue?
[11:10:08] <zmode> BillCriswell: i don't expect the request to trigger something or fix anything else at this point. i apologize if this sounds stubborn but i'm doing tons of back-end work which i'd love to see working before i move on
[11:12:43] <BillCriswell> zmode: if this alerts 'Foo' it doesn't mean the $.get was successful: $.get('something.php'); alert('Foo');
[11:13:28] <zmode> BillCriswell: i understand. however if i do add the alert, i do see the GET request running
[11:17:44] <zmode> BillCriswell: i did however plug $.when in and no alert runs.
[11:18:21] <BillCriswell> zmode: I really don't see how the alert() can have an affect on the $.get()
[11:22:43] <zmode> ..race condition?
[11:23:58] <BillCriswell> zmode: Hard to know without looking at the code
[11:24:13] <BillCriswell> Just adding an alert() isn't allowed a $.get() request to finish.
[11:24:37] <BillCriswell> isn't allowing*
[11:25:26] <NoiseEee> zmode: its precisely because of callbacks
[11:25:26] <BillCriswell> zmode: What happens if you just do $.get('/some/path') in the console, does it reply?
[11:25:43] <NoiseEee> zmode: while you're alert() is waiting to pass by pressing 'enter', your previous request finishes
[11:25:56] <NoiseEee> zmode: construct proper code, win.  continue with bad code, lose.
[11:26:46] <zmode> BillCriswell: sure. NoiseEee: alright.
[11:27:27] <NoiseEee> zmode: basically i'd say your 'get' call not working is due to it expecting something retrieved from the previous ajax call
[11:29:49] <BillCriswell> zmode: Are you trying to do like $.get('one.php', function(){ a = 'two.php' }); $.get( a, function(){ /* I just got two.php */ }); ?
[11:30:44] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Your buddy jop008 just left.
[11:30:52] <zmode> BillCriswell: no, just a get()
[11:31:00] <NoiseEee> damn, i assume he's miles ahead of where he was monday BillCriswell
[11:31:26] <NoiseEee> zmode: except you ARE expecting function 1 to complete entirely before function 2; your pasted code shows you firing both
[11:32:03] <BillCriswell> zmode: Where do a and b come from?
[11:32:04] <NoiseEee> zmode: just... you know... make it correct/2013 appropriate. there is absolutely no point in writing 'quick functions' that just 'make sure its working' and not conforming to best practices / proper coding.
[11:32:20] <zmode> NoiseEee: func1(); func2(); is parallel?
[11:32:26] <zmode> NoiseEee: yeah, i know. thanks once again.
[11:32:57] <NoiseEee> no, but if func2() is expecting results from an ajax/xhr call in func1() things gonna bust
[11:32:58] <zmode> BillCriswell: hard coded. there's no dependencies here
[11:33:18] <NoiseEee> zmode: the "works fine with alert()" is a giveaway
[11:34:15] <BillCriswell> zmode: I have no idea then. Something isn't being explained correctly.
[11:34:25] <zmode> perhaps. thanks again.
[11:34:31] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[11:36:19] <BillCriswell> zmode: Wait... are you sure you don't want location.reload() in the callback of func2()? Which, you should be waiting for all the requests from func1 to finish anyway since the reload can happen before all the requests are complete.
[11:37:33] <obenns> I get $(this) and everything. But what if I don't have an event handler? How can I make sure I apply it to each occurence of a selector?
[11:37:51] <obenns> ah .each
[11:38:44] <andresdavia> is it possible load() fails in some browsers?
[11:39:34] <BillCriswell> obenns: Depending on what you need to do you could do like... $('div').html(function(i,oldHTML){ return oldHTML + ' - Said div' });
[11:41:26] <zmode> BillCriswell: et viola.
[11:41:32] <BillCriswell> Say what?
[11:41:41] <zmode> BillCriswell: it worked.
[11:41:42] <obenns> BillCriswell: Ah okay, I think i get that. I'll take a look thanks buddy
[11:42:23] <anew> i have Object {success: false}, and am testing it with ( json.success == 'false') but it's not working, what's wrong here ?
[11:42:42] <BillCriswell> zmode: Ok, but be careful because the requests in func1 may not have completed if you only put the reload in the callback of func2
[11:44:33] <jshanab> I am migrating from jquery 1.7 to 1.10 and the new tabs API is giving me trouble. Add has been removed along with the add callback. I was lazy loading the content of the tabs and there is no event that I can find for that anymore. create is fired once at create time, not per tab and all the others seem to need a mouse click to get them going.
[11:44:47] <BillCriswell> zmode: http://jsfiddle.net/uvMzD/1/ this will make sure they're all done
[11:46:03] <BillCriswell> Wish I could get jsfiddle to output some text for the ajax requests.
[11:46:36] <BillCriswell> /echo/text?text=1, /echo/text?text=2, /echo/text?text=3, etc
[11:46:52] <andresdavia> is it possible load() fails in some browsers?
[11:46:53] <andresdavia> ?
[11:47:19] <BillCriswell> andresdavia: It's unlikely. I hate saying impossible though.
[11:47:29] <BillCriswell> andresdavia: Have a demo and a browser in mind
[11:47:30] <BillCriswell> ?
[11:49:41] <andresdavia> BillCriswell:  http://jsfiddle.net/9dYF2/1/
[11:50:08] <andresdavia> BillCriswell:  it works in a resent version of chrome but not in oldies
[11:51:39] <Caraes_Naur> (in 1.10.3) why is the ui-datepicker-close button not included in the datepicker buttonpane if the instance is inline?
[11:52:35] <BillCriswell> andresdavia: Not even sure how to test in old chrome without loading up browser stack haha
[11:53:12] <BillCriswell> andresdavia: What part is failing?
[11:53:37] <andresdavia> BillCriswell:  everything works fine.. it just doesnt load hehe
[11:55:00] <andresdavia> BillCriswell: i need to refresh in order to see the results.. however as i said before i have teste this code in a resent version of chrome and it worked fine.. so i really dont know whats going on
[11:56:29] <saml> hey, can I apply some logic to $('.deferload')   even if <span class="deferload">  will be created later by user action?
[11:56:53] <saml> when $(document).ready()  I want to initialize all stuff even for future dom elements
[11:56:56] <saml> is it possible?
[11:57:02] <NoiseEee> saml: $(containerThatWillHoldSpan).on(someEvent,'.deferload',function(){});
[11:57:09] <iredmedia> Yes. Jquery event delegation $().on
[11:57:22] <iredmedia> NoiseEee: (Y)
[11:57:24] <NoiseEee> saml: just make sure that first element is present at page load; if not, move up another object
[11:57:25] <saml> so DOM has event that fires on appendChild or something?
[11:57:28] <NoiseEee> s/object/element
[11:57:34] <NoiseEee> saml: event bubble,.
[11:57:37] <NoiseEee> events bubble.
[11:57:56] <saml> not sure what event it fires when el.innerHTML = "<span class=.."
[11:58:05] <saml> or el.appendChild
[11:58:09] <saml> let me duckduckgo
[11:58:10] <iredmedia> The object for which the delegate events is attached must exist on page load, which is why many people attach it to body/html, though this can provoke debate
[11:58:18] <dblosevn> the event will be fired on what ever element you bound it too eg document in this case
[11:58:32] <saml> i need to know the name of the event that'll fire
[11:58:50] <dblosevn> e.target will have the element that triggered the event
[12:00:04] <saml> there doesn't seem to be an event for dom tree manipulation
[12:00:15] <iredmedia> What type of manipulation?
[12:00:19] <iredmedia> Removal/addition?
[12:00:24] <saml> addition
[12:00:55] <iredmedia> can  you explain the logic and maybe i can provide a workaroun?
[12:01:04] <saml> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900151/is-there-a-jquery-event-that-fires-when-a-new-node-is-inserted-into-the-dom
[12:01:12] <saml> DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument ?
[12:01:16] <jshanab> I am running into the same issue i think, but for tabs. No add event and the new append/refresh does not callback
[12:01:41] <saml> yah.. so i'm using Adobe CQ
[12:01:51] <iredmedia> DOMNodeInserted
[12:02:21] <saml> i think it's ExtJs.     when someone does something, it does xhr, gets html, and inserts it somewhere. i need to do something on that inserted element
[12:03:09] <saml> i mean.. someone added image lazy load functionality.. so when images are drag-dropped into the page, it becomes <span class="lazyload" data-src="hotgirl.jpg"></span>
[12:03:19] <saml> but the lazy load script doesn't get triggered
[12:03:33] <saml> because that <span> doesn't exist
[12:03:34] <saml> oh
[12:03:39] <saml> i can modify lazyload script!
[12:03:42] <iredmedia> Lol yes.
[12:03:46] <BillCriswell> andresdavia: I'm not sure. =/
[12:03:52] <saml> and have it listen to some event on <body>
[12:04:08] <iredmedia> I cannot think of a single reason this functionality would be required.
[12:04:13] <andresdavia> no problem.. guess not way to finding that out
[12:04:26] <NoiseEee> saml: lazyLoadSomething(); doStuffWithNewThings();
[12:04:27] <dblosevn> saml: http://jsfiddle.net/dfXqt/
[12:04:44] <iredmedia> The beauty in dev, is there are always work arounds. If something is ADDED to the dom, something must have added it, thus that should be enough to do the rest of your logic. Things dont get added from outside without your knowledge
[12:06:10] <dblosevn> saml: I bound a delegated event then injected a new element in the dom that element got the event
[12:06:43] <dblosevn> the event bubbled from the element I injected up to body and triggered the event
[12:10:45] <d13k> I'm usind jquery's slideDown option but it doesn't work when I zoom in ( CTRL + "+" ).
[12:14:14] <Sykan> All: I retract my question, Figured it out. It was a CSS Scope error.
[12:14:18] <Guest15765> visuallightbox.com has flooded jQuery.com can someone ban 'em?
[12:14:42] <NoiseEee> Guest15765: wat
[12:15:38] <Guest15765> visuallightbox.com has tons of Light Boxes on jQuery.com
[12:15:39] <Guest15765> They should have only 1 listing
[12:16:00] <iredmedia> http://jsfiddle.net/iredmedia/JTWmk/2/
[12:16:18] <iredmedia> Simple example of DOMNodeInserted :\... i guess its not 'todocument
[12:20:04] <Guest15765> Anyway to trick "jquery hoverZoom" into not using UL/li?   https://github.com/jmar/jquery-hoverZoom
[12:24:30] <Guest15765> hoverZoom is a lightbox alternative
[12:25:47] <Guest15765> hoverZoom works more or less on mobile sometimes the loader.gif shows...
[12:33:19] <jshanab> In jquery 1.10 what event can I use do do somthing on tab creation (adding a new tab)
[12:35:07] <BillCriswell> jshanab: You'd have to just run a function after you add the tab I think.
[12:35:33] <rook2pawn> in jquerymobile if i have 3 textinput fields,the virtual keyboard obscures the 3rd one as i enter text. is there a packaged solution to this? scrollable?
[12:36:02] <jshanab> I have existing code that had a add callback and used a template. I need to mimic that
[12:38:01] <jshanab> I'd just use beforeActivate and call activate, but I do not know the tab number and it looks like you must provide it
[12:38:56] <jshanab> I mean set the "active" option  , there isn't an activate :-)
[12:39:16] <onethfour> what does this mean: jQuery('#id_startdate').datePicker()
[12:39:17] <onethfour> TypeError: Object [object Date] has no method 'zeroTime'
[12:54:31] <negev> hi there, i have a div with a <ul> at the top, and then empty space.  i want to be able to select items in the ul by binding click events, and then click in the empty space to deselect.  problem is, if i bind click on the containing div, it fires even when i click <li>'s which are on top of it
[12:54:40] <negev> what's the best way to fix this?
[12:57:32] <iredmedia> Yes there is
[12:58:03] <iredmedia> negev: inspect the event (on the callback). find the 'target' and ensure that it is NOT the 'li', or that it IS the 'container'
[12:59:57] <jshanab> How in the world do I migrate this http://pastebin.com/72D6Trzv to 1.10 ?  This is driving me nuts. Unless I am missing something They removed a critical part of the functionality
[13:09:47] <amph1bius|ghost> is there a jquery count down plugin that animates the next digits from the top to the bottom
[13:10:51] <amph1bius|ghost> http://www.egrappler.com/county/black.htm
[13:10:52] <amph1bius|ghost> ah
[13:18:31] <rodyhaddad> How does jQuery take care of storing the things given to it by `.data`?
[13:18:47] <amph1bius|ghost> in memory
[13:19:13] <rodyhaddad> does it use .dataset?
[13:19:35] <amph1bius|ghost> not that i know of
[13:22:22] <NoiseEee> rodyhaddad: 'storing' ?
[13:24:53] <rodyhaddad> NoiseEee: well if you do $el.data('name', someObject). I'm looking in jqLite (for angularjs), and it stores things in a normal js object, where the key is an id that it gives to each element. So I'm wondering if jQuery's way of doing it is similar
[13:25:53] <onethfour> i think kevin luck's datePicker is conflicting with jquery ui datePicker.... is there a way to rename one of them?
[13:27:37] <Kenaniah> hi all. How do I get the X-Requested-With header set for AJAX POST requests (using jQuery 2.0.1)? Explicitly setting the header doesn't work.
[13:28:22] <Kenaniah> posted as a multipart form, btw
[13:28:41] <NoiseEee> Kenaniah: um isnt that up to your backend?
[13:28:55] <Kenaniah> NoiseEee: I'm using $.ajax({})
[13:29:18] <NoiseEee> but X-Requested-With gets *sent* with ajax to the backend
[13:29:24] <NoiseEee> afaik?
[13:29:31] <Kenaniah> actually, it doesn't. The problem is that the request is generated without the X-Requested-With header.
[13:29:40] <Kenaniah> GET requests work perfectly though
[13:29:45] <Kenaniah> only on posts is this an issue
[13:30:27] <Kenaniah> the docs state that the header is always set by default, but both my server logs and chrome debugger tell me that ain't the case
[13:32:10] <Quest> the login div and the accordion collapsing terms are in TDs side by side but I cant figure out why both are virtically positioned and not side by side . http://jsfiddle.net/DnsvJ/      any help?

[13:36:53] <chxane> Does jQuery clone() add a disabled attribute to textareas?
[13:37:04] <NoiseEee> chxane: not unless the original ones are disabled
[13:37:16] <chxane> ok then it is something else
[13:37:17] <chxane> thanks

[14:22:30] <jshanab> I am getting "jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier." as I call $(ui.panel).load(..."   It worked in 1.7 but I have had to change a lot to migrate to 1.10. Any ideas what i missed
[14:28:35] <CrashTest_> Anyone know how I might do something like use ready as an event for one()?
[14:35:40] <dwarder_> i need to check if 3 input type=text are entered, what kind of events should i check for?
[14:39:56] <DarkGhost`> whats a good looking jquery popup box?
[14:40:01] <DarkGhost`> not a plugin, but just.. idk..
[14:40:13] <onethfour> jquery.dialogPrompt()
[14:42:31] <DarkGhost`> not nice enough.
[14:43:01] <onethfour> modify the jquery ui dialog?
[14:43:22] <DarkGhost`> do I than need to include the .ui.js and .css?
[14:43:24] <dwarder> is there on key enter?
[14:43:25] <dwarder> event
[14:43:33] <DarkGhost`> keyDown and keyUp dwarder
[14:43:52] <onethfour> yeah you'll need the jquery ui included
[14:44:48] <dwarder> DarkGhost`: will that work if i want to check every time user enteres a char in my input type text?
[14:44:54] <DarkGhost`> yes
[14:44:59] <dwarder> awesome thank you
[14:45:14] <onethfour> you might want to check for onpaste
[14:46:34] <dwarder> onethfour: besides keyDown?
[15:05:23] <Seele> Hello folks.
[15:05:35] <Seele> I have a issue here if anyone is kind enough to assist me, thanks
[15:05:42] <DarkGhost`> dont ask to ask, just ask.
[15:05:53] <dwarder> ask to ask to ask to ask
[15:05:58] <dwarder> dont :)
[15:06:02] <Seele> I am trying to implement a "Load More" button into my script that i bought
[15:06:22] <DarkGhost`> Hello, http://privatepaste.com/b29e4f28a8 I keep getting the error this.element.prop is not a function for some reason.. any ideas?
[15:06:34] <onethfour> dwarder, yeah if the user right clicks and chooses paste, it will get past your onkeydown
[15:06:46] <onethfour> so in some cases you need to worry about it
[15:06:57] <Seele> I already have a $.ajax into my js in my script i am not sure if i can add 1 more $.ajax into the js file.
[15:07:02] <Seele> Can i have 2 times $.ajax?
[15:07:04] <onethfour> sure why not
[15:07:06] <onethfour> of course
[15:07:08] <onethfour> it is a function
[15:07:20] <Seele> I see, so i can have 1 for load more and 1 for the fetching of data?
[15:07:25] <onethfour> sure
[15:07:25] <DarkGhost`> onethfour want to check out my paste real quick?
[15:07:36] <onethfour> can't at work
[15:07:44] <DarkGhost`> whattt
[15:07:47] <dwarder> onethfour: thank you
[15:07:49] <DarkGhost`> ok thank you anyway
[15:07:59] <Seele> http://pastebin.com/7K7p10B2
[15:08:05] <Seele> This is my $.ajax what i have right now
[15:08:26] <Seele> so as onethfour is saying i can create 1 more $.ajax under it where i add the "start_limit" or smth for the next loading?
[15:08:50] <Seele> LIMIT $start_from, $limit";
[15:09:11] <Seele> So the $start_from must be sent via ajax? or ? to have the "load more" button?
[15:09:14] <dwarder> what is supposed to return this $("input[type='text'][value!='']");
[15:09:15] <dwarder> ?
[15:09:16] <Seele> Or am i wrong here
[15:09:48] <dwarder> i need to find out if an input type text is empty or not
[15:09:59] <onethfour> you dont want to use value=
[15:10:04] <onethfour> because that is only on page load
[15:10:19] <onethfour> just do $('input[type=text]').val() == ''
[15:10:29] <onethfour> but you should do it for a specific input box
[15:10:30] <Seele> onethfour can you help me a bit please
[15:10:37] <Seele> with my "load more" case:P
[15:10:41] <Seele> If i am not asking to much
[15:10:45] <onethfour> can't its more indepth than i'd like
[15:10:48] <onethfour> and i'm at work
[15:10:54] <Seele> I see ok
[15:11:02] <Seele> So its complicated to add it..
[15:11:21] <CrashTest_> I am having a problem where a couple of inputs that I am adding via .after() are getting replicated every time a not related piece of js runs an ajax request. I can't figure out how to use .one to ensure that my fields get created only once, any ideas?
[15:11:48] <Seele> Anyone on the irc that can help me solve a "Load More" button into my script? Thank you
[15:14:26] <Seele> onethfour when will you get home?
[15:14:33] <Seele> if i am not rude asking
[15:17:40] <DarkGhost`> WHY am I always getting this.element.prop!
[15:18:24] <DarkGhost`> WHY am I always getting this.element.prop is not a function !
[15:20:42] <sonOfRa> show your code in a fiddle
[15:20:48] <sonOfRa> or somewhere else
[15:27:44] <DarkGhost`> Hello, http://privatepaste.com/b29e4f28a8 I keep getting the error this.element.prop is not a function for some reason.. any ideas? sonOfRa
[15:27:48] <Seele> Anyone there can help me with a "Load More" button?
[15:28:09] <Seele> i need help to implement it in my script, i cannot figure it out the right way to do it since i already have a $.ajax call
[15:28:17] <bob-98274> is it normal to get 100 or so of these types of errors (on web console in FF) when a page loads with jquery?  [17:26:56.117] TypeError: anonymous function does not always return a value @ http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.js:2337
[15:30:01] <snover> bob-98274: no. do not turn on global strict mode.
[15:30:37] <bob-98274> snover: ok.  that makes sense, but I thought jquery was compatible with global strict.  Not so?
[15:31:12] <snover> why do you think that?
[15:32:19] <bob-98274> random thought probably.  maybe it's a 2.0 goal?
[15:32:54] <Seele> Anyone can help me with a "Load More" button.. for my script? i can provide pastebin
[15:36:15] <Seele> Anyone can help me with a jquery load more integration into my script please?
[15:36:47] <bob-98274> Seele: the pastebin might be a good idea.
[15:36:57] <Seele> I did before, ok
[15:37:01] <Seele> i'll do it again then moment
[15:37:20] <Seele> This is my AJAX -> http://pastebin.com/7K7p10B2
[15:37:29] <Seele> This is my PHP -> http://pastebin.com/DAbEK4QH
[15:37:43] <Seele> What i try to do i added a $limit and $start_from variable and added it into my SQL
[15:38:01] <Seele> My problem now is that i have no idea how to add properly a Load More button here.
[15:38:28] <Seele> Right now what i have is my script loads 10 objects from my database and stops there.
[15:38:44] <Seele> What i want is to have a load more button under and request more , 10 each time member press button.
[15:39:17] <Seele> How can i add that since i already use $.ajax once in my JS... and as i read on tutorials i need to use $.ajax
[15:39:25] <Seele> for this to work properly.. ^^ any clues?
[15:39:52] <bob-98274> do you have a "More..." button with a click event associated?
[15:40:00] <Seele> Right now not
[15:40:15] <Seele> So give me steps, what i must do is a div with click event and add in JS this click function yes?
[15:40:19] <Seele> this is my first step?
[15:41:27] <bob-98274> $("#more").click(function(){ ... });
[15:41:44] <Seele> yes, so this is for the Div ID more, ok i know this
[15:41:47] <Seele> Next what i must do?
[15:41:57] <Seele> for the more button to actually fetch next 10 results?
[15:42:14] <bob-98274> looks like you know how to do an ajax call already.  just do another $.ajax(...) inside that function.
[15:43:06] <Seele> I see hmm
[15:43:21] <Seele> Ok, so this click event, do i need to add it into my ajax call? my one that i pastebin you
[15:43:24] <Seele> or i do it under it?
[15:43:32] <bob-98274> using whatever url or data values you need to change to get the "next 10 results".  Probably have to refer to the google maps api for that.
[15:43:54] <Seele> i atm extract data
[15:43:57] <Seele> from my database
[15:44:04] <Seele> So i think it wont need google api, or?
[15:44:11] <bob-98274> assuming you have the current one in your on-ready event it would be "after"
[15:44:52] <Seele> Ok, hm so then.. when i will click "Load More" what will happen? will it erase my first 10 results
[15:45:01] <Seele> and add other 10 results? or it will add after it?:-??
[15:45:57] <bob-98274> that would depend on what you do in that "success" function
[15:46:29] <Seele> well yeah that's my problem actually because i already have $.ajax once.. with a success thingy
[15:46:33] <Seele> so that's why i was very confused
[15:46:47] <bob-98274> I guess I am not seeing where you are "displaying" the first 10 results.  are they in the "msg" structure?
[15:46:48] <Seele> if i do a new "$.ajax for my load more" i bet it will erase my results and put others..
[15:47:00] <Seele> yes
[15:47:07] <Seele> 		echo json_stores_list($sql);
[15:47:17] <Seele> this does it, and ofc it comes from the jquery success(msg)
[15:48:42] <Seele> as you can see in jquery the content is builded
[15:48:44] <bob-98274> hm...  you might be setting that $.ajax to a div or something?  you did not paste that part.
[15:48:46] <Seele> with .html( and ...
[15:49:08] <Seele> i can paste you
[15:49:13] <Seele> whole js and index if you want
[15:49:35] <Seele> but as i understand it i dont think i set it to any, it is creating the content
[15:49:37] <Seele> in jquery
[15:49:38] <Seele> with
[15:49:39] <Seele> $("<li id='l_"+marker['__gm_id']+"' class='clinic_list double-digit' />")
[15:49:41] <Seele> like this
[15:49:43] <Seele> class=''
[15:50:06] <Seele> so i create in jquery a <li id="l_34343" class'x' ..
[15:50:07] <Seele> and so on
[15:51:27] <Seele> So that was my concern that the code is complex for my understanding and i don't understand this jquery fully
[15:51:32] <Seele> to be able to know the right place
[15:51:39] <Seele> to add the load more stuff
[15:52:00] <bob-98274> well, I do not know how you are building the .html() stuff so how you do that and what you do with it would determine if the existing data was added to or replaced.
[15:52:46] <bob-98274> also, in your SQL you will probably need to pass something like a "start_from=11" or a "page=2" and then set start_from to (page-1)*10+1 or something like that.
[15:53:26] <Seele> yeah
[15:53:36] <DarkGhost`> Hello, http://privatepaste.com/b29e4f28a8 I keep getting the error this.element.prop is not a function for some reason.. any ideas?
[15:53:37] <Seele> i read that in some tuts about page-1 etc, but hmm...
[15:54:02] <Seele> what posibile ways are to build a .html ?
[15:54:41] <Seele> maybe google api
[15:54:44] <Seele> does it:-??
[15:54:44] <bob-98274> just do whatever you are doing for the first 10.  You should get back the second 10 in the exact same format.
[15:55:11] <Seele> yeah true, well i will try my best bob :D
[15:55:40] <bob-98274> good luck.  awsome formula you have there btw...
[15:55:54] <Seele> thank you, is it bad or good :D?
[15:56:04] <Seele> i mean its for real awesome :P or its sarcastic D:
[15:56:15] <bob-98274> just don't see acos() function used that much in sql...
[15:56:23] <Seele> yes its because
[15:56:33] <Seele> google require that
[15:56:49] <bob-98274> it makes sense though.
[15:56:52] <Seele> well look if you have free time in 10 min, if i dont succeed maybe you take a look with Team Viewer?
[15:57:03] <Seele> i think you will understand it much faster then me
[15:57:23] <Seele> its clear coded but i am bad in coding i bought this script
[15:57:38] <Seele> so maybe you can figure out faster it, but i will try myself before that np
[15:57:43] <Seele> and just incase you have free time
[15:57:51] <Seele> i'll ask your help bob if that's ok with you
[15:57:54] <bob-98274> just try to take it one step at a time.  sounds like you are making progress.
[15:58:21] <Seele> :P
[15:58:24] <Seele> oki
[15:58:35] <Seele> as i said i am up to try and not give up etc i am not that kind of guy :D
[15:58:45] <Seele> to give up fast, but its been 2 days i am trying to solve it
[15:58:49] <Seele> pretty tired:P but i'll give a shoot
[15:59:04] <Seele> lets hope your suggestions will guide me well
[15:59:07] <bob-98274> sounds like it.  good luck.  others are around to help but you just need to be patient.
[15:59:18] <Seele> yeah
[15:59:21] <Seele> np ty bob
[15:59:24] <Seele> <3

[16:36:06] <picoguy2> sahbeewah:  thanks!
[17:10:06] <kba> I have a contenteditable div that I add content to like this: $('#preview').html('<h1>d&b</h1>'); When I try to get the "content back" after it's been edited or whatever, I try to do a console.log('$('#preview').html()'). The problem is what I get back now is "<h1>d&amp;b</h1>". If I try .text() instead of .html(), I get back just "d&b". I want the raw HTML back. Any idea how to fix this?
[17:10:58] <kba> (Mistake in the example, obviously there are no ' around the expression in console.log().)
[17:16:51] <sahbeewah> kba, define raw HTML
[17:16:56] <sahbeewah> what are you expecting back
[17:18:15] <NChief> gay
[17:21:24] <kba> sahbeewah: Exactly what I give it.
[17:21:45] <kba> sahbeewah: I set the HTML to be '<h1>d&b</h1>'. That's what I want back.
[17:27:39] <aaairc> would anyone know why my youtube iframe embeds seemed to stop working on the iPad? Here is my JSfiddle code http://jsfiddle.net/bjWtY/ using the iframe api. Even using just straight iframe html code doesn't seem to work on my iPad either though, as shown with this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/EwBw9/. All the code works on my desktop browsers.
[17:39:25] <sahbeewah> kba, you can't get that back because it doesn't put that inside the dom
[17:39:28] <negev> hi, if i have an outer div with two inner divs, and click on one of the inner divs, the outer div get's a blur message
[17:39:36] <sahbeewah> it gets processed, that's the whole idea behind html encoding
[17:39:59] <negev> is there a way to bind blur/focus to the outer divs and include the inner divs in the calculation?
[17:40:06] <sahbeewah> you'll need to decode the html encoded characters manually
[17:41:18] <Guest79067> is there a way to move a div on hover/click from one place to another but with smoothness?
[17:41:34] <Guest79067> is there a way to move a div on hover/click from one place to another but with smoothness? just like css3 transition translate postition?
[17:42:35] <pixelpimp> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[17:42:39] <sahbeewah> negev, example? that doesn't really make sense... you can bind to an outerdiv and have access to the inner div that was affected, if that's what you mean => e.target
[17:43:08] <negev> well, outer div blur() callback i'm doing:
[17:43:09] <negev> $(this).fadeTo(400,'0.6');
[17:43:19] <negev> but when i click on an inner div, this is triggered
[17:43:24] <negev> so it fades out and then back in again
[17:43:25] <negev> which is annoying
[17:45:33] <sahbeewah> $(outer_div_selector).blur(function(e) { if (!$(e.target).is(inner_div_selector)) { do_fade(); } }); ... or something to that effect
[17:45:36] <sahbeewah> is probably what you're after
[17:46:40] <negev> cool thanks
[17:46:48] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  well nevermind. how to change the marginleft and right of a div on click/ hover and with a duration??
[17:47:31] <negev> like this?
[17:47:43] <pixelpimp> Guest79067: the same URL applies
[17:47:46] <negev> http://pastebin.com/1sxxhHkL
[17:47:49] <negev> doesn't work :(
[17:47:51] <negev> still fades out
[17:48:11] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  greate. thanks
[17:48:19] <negev> weirdly there are 3 inner divs and it's only happening on the middle one
[17:48:26] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  this will be cross browser compatile?
[17:48:54] <pixelpimp> that's jQuery's attempt, yes
[17:49:13] <pixelpimp> can't say for certain; there's lots of ways to fuck stuff up
[17:49:40] <sahbeewah> negev, .is() takes in a selector string, not the query object
[17:49:51] <sahbeewah> hard to say without the elements
[17:49:58] <sahbeewah> you should probably post up a fiddle
[17:57:24] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  not working http://jsfiddle.net/B2jnB/
[17:59:19] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  nevermind. I had to put the code after the divs in my html
[17:59:21] <Guest79067> works now
[17:59:47] <pixelpimp> your </div> is malformed as well
[18:00:13] <pixelpimp> but you likely just need to move everything into $(document).ready()
[18:07:03] <Guest79067> k
[18:07:57] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  $("#circle").animate({
[18:07:58] <Guest79067> 				opacity: 0.4,				marginRigh: "-400px",          is valid? doesnt works though. other things / properties work
[18:09:43] <pixelpimp> missing t is in the real code?
[18:09:46] <Guest79067> I have a div on the right top corner
[18:09:50] <Guest79067> yes
[18:09:55] <pixelpimp> then that's your problem
[18:10:02] <pixelpimp> marginRight
[18:10:12] <Guest79067> i want to make it move away from the corner a bit on click
[18:10:52] <pixelpimp> that is not what you are trying to do with that code
[18:10:54] <Guest79067> oh got
[18:10:56] <Guest79067> God
[18:11:01] <Guest79067> God*
[18:11:05] <pixelpimp> you are telling things to the right to overlap your object by 400px
[18:11:22] <Guest79067> I got it. silly me
[18:11:24] <negev> sahbeewah: you still there?
[18:11:25] <pixelpimp> which probably isn't doing anything, really
[18:11:49] <pixelpimp> you want to make the left margin negative or position it differently, or apply a transform
[18:11:57] <negev> http://89.16.176.6/resize/  i want it to add the transparency when i defocus the window, which works, except if click on the div where the text is it also triggers blur() and fades out
[18:14:57] <trollwork> feel free to tell me no, but does anyone know of a version of the cycle() plugin (or an alternative) that works on 1.4.2?
[18:15:04] <trollwork> or 1.4.3 even
[18:25:14] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  is there something silly in this code http://pastebin.com/hmZgv8zb ?
[18:25:44] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  only works for the first condition. . not for the second
[18:27:04] <pixelpimp> what only works?
[18:29:27] <Guest79067> this if(myVar != 1){
[18:29:27] <Guest79067>                                           $("#circle").animate({
[18:29:33] <Guest79067> only once.
[18:31:07] <pixelpimp> you mean it's only doing the if, not the else?  myVar is always != 1, so it will only ever do the if
[18:32:40] <Guest79067> well these are two margin cords.   i.e two locations. when i first time click the circle. it moves and makes the var 1, after running the first condition.
[18:33:20] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  the second time. i press the circle, now the myVar is 1, so the second (else) condition should run.    that doesnt
[18:33:24] <sahbeewah> negev, ok i understand
[18:33:55] <sahbeewah> negev, it's a little funny situation, btw you shouldn't be using live/die, and esp not calling them several times
[18:34:00] <pixelpimp> Guest79067: you are not storing it anywhere.  you leave scope, lose the variable, then enter back into scope
[18:34:15] <Guest79067> hm......
[18:34:24] <Guest79067> so where do i put the variable?
[18:34:34] <pixelpimp> somewhere in the current scope
[18:34:57] <Guest79067> am.. where?
[18:35:43] <Guest79067> pixelpimp,  got it. I put it just below $(document).ready(function(){   and now it works.
[18:35:45] <Guest79067> thanks!!!!!!!!
[18:35:53] <sahbeewah> negev, you can't really blur a div, it's just bubbling the blur event up from the chatbox, and this happens before the click handler is affected
[18:37:36] <sahbeewah> negev, so, i'm not sure of any smart way of achieving that...
[18:38:52] <sahbeewah> one dumb way would be to set a 0.5 second timeout to unfocus the window upon blurring the chatbox, and cancelling the timeout if it detects a click on the chat content
[18:41:44] <negev> i think im just gonna get rid of the transparancy, its not that great anyway
[18:42:22] <trollwork> so if I'm grabbing a bunch of div's via $('.classname'); how can I target div3 for example?  $('.classname')[2] ?
[18:44:06] <anon411> how to put cursor to the end of textarea after focus?

[20:29:55] <DarkGhost`> Hello, http://privatepaste.com/b29e4f28a8 I keep getting the error this.element.prop is not a function for some reason.. any ideas?
[21:42:43] <OveRRide> Hello Guys, when i use the remote flag within a query validate to prevent duplicates from being added to my database, the twitter bootstrap modal my form is in doesn't submit, it validates and i have to click submit a second time… if i remove the remote flag, it simply validates and submits like its supposed too… here is a link to my code, any idea on what's going on? http://codepad.org/67b14MwC
[21:47:01] <mph> OveRRide: I'm tired, so take this with a grain of salt
[21:47:03] <mph> but
[21:47:11] <OveRRide> k...
[21:48:11] <mph> wait nevermind
[21:48:16] <mph> I had the wrong docs up
[21:48:30] <OveRRide> damn...
[21:48:43] <mph> did you try setting the debug flag
[21:48:46] <mph> and checking that?
[21:50:00] <mph> and does your form have a native submit
[21:51:26] <OveRRide> mph: yes it does, and I'm setting the debug flag as we speak although i don't expect much info from that
[21:51:55] <mph> well then I am out of ideas
[21:51:57] <OveRRide> just as i suspected
[21:51:59] <OveRRide> nothing
[21:52:02] <OveRRide> it validates
[21:52:08] <OveRRide> then makes me click the submit button
[21:52:09] <OveRRide> after
[21:52:32] <mph> try tossing a console.log into the submitHandler option and see if it fires that way
[21:53:22] <mph> function(form){console.log(form);}
[21:55:31] <OveRRide> submithandler fires
[21:55:34] <OveRRide> it just doesn't really submit
[21:55:42] <sammich> so I was looking to make a CSS only dropdown, but a layering issue with UI-draggable kills the :hover. Should I just replace it with a jQuery div using position{}?
