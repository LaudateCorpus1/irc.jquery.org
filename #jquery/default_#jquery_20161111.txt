[01:56:55] <SpecialTechnique> Is there a way to listen when React.js is done loading with jquery?
[01:57:25] <Cork> depends on how you load it, but basically; no
[01:58:33] <SpecialTechnique> hmmm
[02:01:03] <SpecialTechnique> Cork: do you have experience with react?
[02:01:22] <Cork> some, but this isn't the channel for it
[02:01:47] <SpecialTechnique> yea understood, was just curious.
[02:01:48] <Cork> if you want help with react => #reactjs
[02:02:59] <SpecialTechnique> Lets hope some one is awake :)
[02:08:43] <dodotheduck> Someone here with some experience with the bootstrap datetimepicker?
[02:11:06] <SpecialTechnique> dodotheduck - I have a bit
[02:11:38] <SpecialTechnique> I'm more accustomed to jquery datepicker, but I assume it's about the same
[02:12:09] <dodotheduck> SpecialTechnique: hi, I'm using http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/
[02:12:21] <dodotheduck> which is kind of the same datetimepicker (or datepicker)
[02:12:23] <Cork> dodotheduck: => ##twitter-bootstrap
[02:12:34] <Cork> please keep the questions on topic
[02:12:35] <dodotheduck> Cork: thanks, will look there next
[02:13:42] <dodotheduck> SpecialTechnique: just trying to use the "input: " option, and I'm always getting a Uncaught TypeError: option input is not recognized!
[02:13:47] <dodotheduck> SpecialTechnique: any idea?
[02:15:55] <SpecialTechnique> Is datepicker loading correct?
[02:16:25] <dodotheduck> it is, the datetimepicker from that site, though
[02:16:38] <dodotheduck> if I leave the input parameter out, all is good
[02:16:54] <SpecialTechnique> hmm
[02:17:36] <SpecialTechnique> dodotheduck try inputs:
[02:18:20] <dodotheduck> SpecialTechnique: nope :(
[02:18:24] <SpecialTechnique> :(
[02:18:27] <dodotheduck> SpecialTechnique: tried, didn't work
[02:19:20] <SpecialTechnique> dodotheduck is the html a range picker
[02:21:20] <dodotheduck> queried you
[08:06:35] <jak2000> hi all, i have a date: 2016/11/11 how to convert to next saturday? in this case 2016/11/12  ?
[08:12:20] <FilipNortic_> jak2000: is it a date or a string?
[08:12:31] <jak2000> i use moment()
[08:12:43] <jak2000> mmm can convert my string to date
[08:13:40] <FilipNortic_> moment has and .add() function
[08:13:45] <FilipNortic_> an*
[08:15:03] <jak2000> add ?
[08:15:18] <jak2000> how many days add?
[08:15:22] <jak2000> in this case is 1
[08:15:42] <jak2000> but what happend if date is: 2016/11/13?
[08:15:42] <FilipNortic_> add(1, 'days')
[08:16:17] <FilipNortic_> so you want to transform any date to a special date that doesn't make any sense
[08:16:29] <jak2000> yes
[08:16:33] <jak2000> any date to next saturday
[08:23:27] <FilipNortic_> jak2000: can't really rember but i think the .day() function in moment can do stuff like that
[08:34:30] <jak2000> FilipNortic: https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/9qgd1jeq/1/   why not put the actual date in the inputs?
[08:37:38] <FilipNortic_> jak2000: you forgot jQuery
[08:37:58] <FilipNortic_> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/9qgd1jeq/2/
[08:38:39] <FilipNortic_> and use console.log() inseted of alert for debug then you see typeerrors and stuff like that in the log
[08:38:59] <FilipNortic_> * as a bonus
[08:45:49] <sillyslux> while(xy.day()!==6)xy.add(1,'days')
[08:46:25] <sillyslux> is that still calculating next saturday?
[08:46:42] <jak2000> yes
[08:46:46] <jak2000> i think in thath
[08:46:49] <jak2000> *that
[08:46:54] <jak2000> sillyslux: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f7592n8j/3/
[08:47:15] <jak2000> choose in both inputs 2016/11/15 please an click on each button
[08:47:17] <jak2000> what happend?
[08:47:48] <sillyslux> alert 2
[08:47:51] <sillyslux> for the right
[08:48:17] <sillyslux> alert NaN on first input
[08:48:53] <sillyslux> what's that good for? what about next saturday?
[09:00:37] <mpathy> Hi there.. If I found a fitting class via: jQuery("[class*='mai-modal']") - how can I find out how the name of the found class is, then?
[09:01:32] <jak2000> sillyslux not know why moment not know the format
[09:01:34] <jak2000> date format
[09:04:46] <FilipNortic_> mpathy: ? you find elements with class with JQuery('.mai-modal') and that obviously has the class mai-modal
[09:05:14] <FilipNortic_> mpathy: do you want the id of the element or class or id of it's parrent?
[09:05:24] <FilipNortic_> parent*
[09:05:42] <jak2000> sillyslux, FilipNortic: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/f7592n8j/6/
[09:05:44] <jak2000> the work is done
[09:06:19] <mpathy> I have some classes, who are called like mai-modal-29384 and I want to find out which one the user clicked on, FilipNortic_
[09:06:38] <lng> Hi! How do I let jQuery know there's added html via ajax as I cannot execute click event on a button
[09:07:01] <AdamPDotty> mpathy: that is not usally how classes work.
[09:07:13] <FilipNortic_> mpathy: yeah that how id works
[09:07:31] <AdamPDotty> lng: define cannot, define execute
[09:07:56] <FilipNortic_> but there is no thecnical hinderce avout using classes that way if you really whant to
[09:08:01] <FilipNortic_> want*
[09:08:11] <jak2000> continue not working for first button if i choose 2016/11/15
[09:08:12] <FilipNortic_> but it a backwords approch
[09:08:44] <mpathy> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ - its possible to find all that fit the pattern.. and I bind it to be clicked and want to find out which one was clicked
[09:09:01] <mpathy> I cant use IDs because the backend only allows to add a class to an element
[09:09:08] <AdamPDotty> usually "this" has been clicked
[09:09:26] <mpathy> yes but this has all the classes of the element
[09:09:41] <AdamPDotty> so you mean, you can not add data
[09:10:07] <mpathy> I want to find out what class he reacted on
[09:10:11] <AdamPDotty> xy
[09:11:48] <mpathy> I want to to have modals when I click on a link. I cant explicitely tell it, but I want to say: If a link was clicked with class xyz-123 look for div with class xyz-123 and display it
[09:12:34] <AdamPDotty> that is what you would do with data-target for example
[09:16:39] <mpathy> I dont use Bootstrap there.. I have to use what I have. And this is to be able to add a class to some div and when I click on it to use something like jQuery UI modal and let it display another div.. But I dont know their names before
[09:18:11] <jak2000> solved....
[09:23:01] <lng> AdamPDotty: define define. .on('body', 'button',...) is I want
[09:23:12] <lng> AdamPDotty: define define. .on('body', 'button',...) is what I want
[09:23:49] <AdamPDotty> I do not know any event named "body"
[09:24:26] <lng> AdamPDotty: it is not an event
[09:29:08] <FilipNortic_> Ing: $('body').("eventname', button,...) is the syntax
[09:29:29] <lng> FilipNortic_: and the colution
[09:29:34] <lng> solution
[09:29:36] <lng> sorry
[09:30:09] <AdamPDotty> Filip: on (!)
[09:30:41] <FilipNortic_> yeah maybe a bit to lazy to ommit that not sure why i idid
[09:30:50] <AdamPDotty> and button as variable only works when defined.
[09:32:22] <FilipNortic_> hmm what was his question i never really made any sense of the define define part...
[09:36:18] <AdamPDotty> The question remains unclear.
[09:44:15] <sinopia> Hello, how can I use this also from a "a href=image" if (/^img$/i.test((e.target || e.srcElement).nodeName)) return false; ?
[09:45:15] <sinopia> onclick it shows a fancybox but I'm trying is to protect the imagem from being copied
[09:46:35] <sinopia> <a id="single_1" style="cursor: -webkit-zoom-in; cursor: -moz-zoom-in" href="..image.jpg"></a>
[10:28:08] <EnchanterTim> Hello. I am using this jquery plugins, http://jscroll.com/ and I think I have configurd it fine, however, the problem is that the plugin does not load/run when the page loads. So when I scroll down, the new page does not load. If however, I go to the console and manually type, https://jsfiddle.net/a0ramapb/1/ the javascript inside the document ready function, it starts to work fine from then on, until the
[10:28:10] <EnchanterTim> page is reloaded. I wonder why it's doing this
[10:31:25] <docmur> I have a problem with my ajax calls after changing the server access from http to https  The certificate is commerically valid, as I have a postive, multidomian, wildcard cert for my domains.  This is my ajax code: http://pastebin.com/i31BHrB8 and in chrome I keep getting: net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE and my log files on the PHP side don't show any message coming across
[10:32:34] <ZoderUck> Hello, could somebody do a short test in chrome to test if a   aac audio player is working in html?
[10:32:39] <ZoderUck> can i give the url here?
[10:34:24] <EnchanterTim> http://98ec83ed.ngrok.io/ <- I opened a tunnel to localhost here if you want to view my site/code changes live etc.
[10:34:53] <EnchanterTim> I can't seem to be able to figure out why the lazy loading only works when I manually type the command in the console, but not when the page loads
[10:39:37] <cool_boy> hi there, how do I set property of an object inside _.filter()  http://pastebin.com/Pwvi6cNE , line 11
[10:41:51] <taplar> it's _.filter lodash?
[10:45:31] <FilipNortic_> doen√§t undercore usally mean it's an internal method?
[10:45:38] <FilipNortic_> dosen't*
[10:45:58] <taplar> it can, but usually there isn't a '.' between the _ and the method, ;)
[10:46:04] <taplar> _. is usually lodasy
[10:46:07] <taplar> lodash
[10:46:38] <FilipNortic_> ._filter()?
[10:46:48] <taplar> https://lodash.com/docs/4.16.6#filter
[10:47:47] <FilipNortic_> didn't think you could use . in names
[10:47:55] <taplar> it's not apart of the name
[10:47:59] <taplar> _ is an object like $
[10:48:32] <cool_boy> FilipNortic it is form underscore.js
[10:49:04] <taplar> or underscore, :D
[10:49:15] <taplar> in either case, not jQuery
[10:49:28] <cool_boy> aah sorry
[10:49:33] <cool_boy> I am in jquery
[10:49:37] <taplar> yup
[10:49:44] <FilipNortic_> ahh tought lodash was a user here
[10:49:46] <cool_boy> very sorry
[10:49:48] <cool_boy> :)
[10:49:50] <taplar> it's cool
[10:51:22] <FilipNortic_> my knowlage of other frameworks then jQuery is so low that I should learn not to comment in those cases
[10:52:10] <FilipNortic_> the trouble is that i don't relize it's non jQuery related untill I'm already in the conversation
[10:52:18] <taplar> heh
[10:52:36] <taplar> i'm only really aware of them because i talk/work with one of our uxers a lot
[10:52:40] <ZoderUck> hi could a person test audio stream url for me? http://radiomart.nl/stream1.htm
[10:59:13] <sinopia> I got a trans pixel over image but on iOS the href just work in clicked twice
[10:59:31] <sinopia> I got pointer-events: none !important; over the pixel layout
[11:30:21] <livingBEEF> So I was adding a thingy to indicate that a page is loading after clicking on this <a href=... onclick="myFunction()">.. but it turns out that something automatically puts dark overlay over the whole page, thanks the the onclick. Any idea if there's some library that automatically does that?
[11:31:42] <livingBEEF> the onlcick contains simple change of one div's content, nothing that SHOULD trigger this sort of thing
[11:36:43] <taplar> sounds like something is showing an overlay on the page
[11:38:41] <livingBEEF> oh, I just figured it out. Turns out the specific cascade of css classes triggred it and I overlooked it
[11:43:59] <jqnewbie> I hope I don't sound like a complete idiot.  I'm retreiving some JSON data.  What's the easiest way to make sure it's in the correct format for JSON using jQuery?
[11:44:18] <taplar> if you try to parse it and it errors, then it's not valid
[11:44:30] <taplar> JSON.parse()
[11:48:07] <jqnewbie> taplar: I take it this would be the error: SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unexpected identifier "object"
[11:48:22] <taplar> yep.  that would kinda suggest it's already parsed
[11:49:26] <jqnewbie> Okay.  I did a json_encode on my php page that returns the data so I'm guessing I'm good already.
[11:49:37] <taplar> that's a good assumption
[11:49:44] <taplar> :)
[11:51:59] <jqnewbie> Anyone ever work with HighMaps?
[12:01:16] <jqnewbie> Has anyone seen this error before? TypeError: c.push is not a function. (In 'c.push(v(a,{value:null}))', 'c.push' is undefined)
[12:01:34] <taplar> make sure c is an array
[12:02:04] <jqnewbie> I'm guessing when I get [object, object, object] that's not an array
[12:02:19] <taplar> no that looks like an array
[12:03:01] <jqnewbie> Actually its {Alabama: object, Alaska: object}
[12:03:09] <jqnewbie> Still an array?
[12:03:13] <taplar> nope
[12:03:28] <jqnewbie> :(
[12:04:41] <jqnewbie> How can I make that an array?
[12:05:01] <taplar> an array in js is []
[12:05:08] <taplar> but arrays do not have string keys
[12:05:18] <taplar> so your going to have to change your logic if you do that
[12:05:24] <taplar> why does it need to be an array
[12:05:25] <taplar> ?
[12:05:39] <jqnewbie> Highcharts requires it be an array
[12:05:54] <taplar> ok, so then you'll have to figure that out
[12:06:06] <jqnewbie> would a mapping of it work?
[12:06:20] <Rocky> hi all
[12:06:26] <jqnewbie> hi Rocky
[12:06:36] <taplar> possibly, i dunno the format that Highcharts is expecting
[12:06:44] <jqnewbie> Okay.
[12:07:01] <Rocky> How can i send authorization header in each and every request?
[12:07:25] <taplar> i'm assuming ajax requests?
[12:08:00] <Rocky> Please give me one example if posible
[12:08:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:08:22] <taplar> i'm asking for clarity on your question dude
[12:08:26] <robertmaxrees> never change #jquery
[12:08:41] <Rocky> yes
[12:08:55] <Guest71701> brb
[12:08:56] <jqnewbie> taplar: I keep getting an error about FOR not being correct on this.  http://kopy.io/ngWXj  Do I have the syntax wrong?
[12:08:57] <taplar> ajax has a headers option you can provide.  check the docs
[12:09:38] <Rocky> @taplar:please suggest me
[12:09:58] <taplar> i suggested an option described in the docs.
[12:10:04] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:10:33] <Rocky> I want to set authorization header in each and every request
[12:10:38] <taplar> jqnewbie: try using Object.keys(obj).forEach() instead
[12:11:13] <taplar> Rocky: you can use the headers option on ajax to give the authorization header
[12:11:16] <taplar> read the docs
[12:11:44] <Rocky> @taplar:Thanks dear
[12:32:29] <roflmyeggo> whats a good general approach to have 2 elements "slide" like a slider
[12:32:31] <roflmyeggo> without jquery ui
[12:32:45] <roflmyeggo> 1 is currently visible, the other is _not_
[12:33:31] <taplar> you can use css transitions to animate sliding
[12:35:36] <taplar> you could even possibly use a prebuilt library for it like https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
[12:39:04] <roflmyeggo> taplar: yeah i looked into that
[12:39:10] <jqnewbie> taplar: Okay, I have it all working except one small bit.
[12:39:16] <roflmyeggo> is that really preferrable to using jquery though?
[12:39:22] <taplar> yes
[12:39:33] <jqnewbie> When I cover the objects to an array, if it's null it puts that as the actual value.  How can I not do this?
[12:39:50] <taplar> css benifits from the browser being able to use gpu acceleration or whatever, iirc
[12:39:50] <roflmyeggo> to play devils adovcate, why?
[12:39:58] <roflmyeggo> oh okay
[12:40:00] <roflmyeggo> very cool
[12:40:03] <taplar> where as jquery will be changing the dom a ton of times
[12:40:14] <roflmyeggo> good points
[12:40:40] <roflmyeggo> thats pretty awesome
[12:41:06] <taplar> which is why if it isn't just ungodly unreadable, if you can do it with css vs js, do it with css, :)
[12:42:00] <taplar> jqnewbie: show what you're trying?
[12:43:44] <jqnewbie> taplar http://kopy.io/EtNUj
[12:44:30] <taplar> key: obj.key || defaultValue
[12:45:48] <jqnewbie> awesome.  that worked like a charm.  Thanks
[12:50:57] <jqnewbie> What did I do wrong with my code?  When it goes through each program in the array, it prints out undefined.  http://kopy.io/RTItH
[12:51:32] <duch_kazatel> console.log(program) in there.
[12:51:35] <duch_kazatel> what do you get?
[12:52:42] <taplar> side note, your closing li tag is wrong
[12:52:43] <jqnewbie> I get 0 through 8 printed out
[12:52:56] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:53:09] <taplar> each() passes in index, element
[12:53:38] <duch_kazatel> oh, $.each
[12:53:50] <duch_kazatel> same with $.fn.each haha
[12:53:51] <duch_kazatel> derp
[12:53:57] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:53:58] <taplar> use this.programs.forEach instead
[12:55:10] <taplar> unless your targeting IE<=8
[12:55:21] <jqnewbie> Ahhhh
[12:55:43] <jqnewbie> It returns a blank row after each one.  Is that typical?
[12:55:53] <taplar> huh?
[12:56:13] <taplar> did you see my comment about your li closing tag being wrong?
[12:57:04] <jqnewbie> HAHAHA, I need to go to bed evidently
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> what a morning
[13:01:27] <taplar> aloha
[13:48:39] <antiPoP> hi which is te proper way to reference the source DOM element in a plugin? I'm using this and i get an error https://gist.github.com/antiPoP/2fae4e1f7402103f0fd2707e906e5213
[13:54:51] <antiPoP> fixed
[13:55:59] <roflmyeggo> antiPop: what was your fix?
[13:56:19] <antiPoP> roflmyeggo,  var self = this;
[13:57:57] <roflmyeggo> antiPop: you could also use $.proxy() or _.bind() probably
[13:58:09] <roflmyeggo> depending on your prefs
[14:01:02] <antiPoP> roflmyeggo, how does work _.bind? Is that jquery ? i can't find it in the docs
[14:01:15] <roflmyeggo> antiPop: its like $.proxy
[14:01:20] <roflmyeggo> but its in underscore.js library
[14:01:30] <roflmyeggo> just depending on if youre using it in your project
[14:03:49] <antiPoP> no, plain jquery
[14:04:32] <mmmveggies> no pain, no jQuery
[14:05:31] <antiPoP> I think i'll left self for now, the proper way is an arrow function, but this is not supported on older browsers
[14:05:41] <antiPoP> roflmyeggo, tnx
[14:05:48] <roflmyeggo> antiPoP: np
[15:31:36] <newbie007> How can I prevent $.dialog() from opening multiple windows at the same time.  I want the one opened to close if another one is opened.
[15:33:17] <taplar> you getting that method from jquery ui?
[15:33:36] <newbie007> yes
[15:34:41] <taplar> how are you getting multiple dialogs?  the dialog should have an overlay to prevent clicks on the underlying body
[15:35:31] <taplar> i thought
[15:36:02] <taplar> huh, nvm
[15:36:50] <taplar> so that would probably be the easiest solution
[15:37:00] <newbie007> What would?
[15:37:11] <taplar> create an overlay with z-index of 99 (dialog is z-index 100) so that users can't click anything on the body
[15:37:28] <taplar> then show/hide it when the dialog opens and closes
[15:37:57] <newbie007> So that overlay would only appear when the dialog is open?
[15:38:01] <taplar> yep
[15:38:39] <newbie007> Okay.  I will on adding that now.
[15:41:05] <newbie007> taplar actually all I had to do was set an option of modal to true and it took care of all of it for me.
[15:41:29] <taplar> well there ya go
[15:43:48] <newbie007> Thanks for the suggestion of the overlay.
[15:47:39] <Utils> Does the callback for $.get still have 2nd and 3rd parameters (textStatus, xhr)? They aren't in the odcumentation for $.get but are in $.ajax
[15:48:19] <taplar> console.log(arguments) and see
[15:55:00] <roflmyeggo> is the best way to re-trigger css animations to clone the element of interest?
[15:55:14] <roflmyeggo> setTimeout hack is nasty
[15:56:43] <taplar> are you using that animate.css library?
[15:58:34] <roflmyeggo> taplar: decided to try to write my own
[15:59:04] <taplar> well, the github for that library has some example of how to catch an event on the animation finish and to remove the added class then

[19:26:12] <m1chael> can anyone explain to me why this code redirects to google immedietely after it's loaded? the desired behavior would be to redirect after the select box was changed
[19:38:18] <Azrael_-> m1chael: "this code" without providing the code? interesting question
[19:38:34] <m1chael> oops: http://dpaste.com/06CNTCR
[19:38:43] <m1chael> :)
[19:39:56] <m1chael> copied it straight from the jquery website
[20:44:57] <inthl> I have an issue with datatables (responsive) that could be solved using jquery and its each() selector to recalc the datatables. Now how do I select all the datatables, after they have been initialized? using $('.datatable').each(function() {  $(this).responsive.recalc(); ...does not work, since this does not select the datatables objects, just the css selectors
[23:34:46] <Utils> How would I get the url from an onpopstate? Can't seem to find anything in the event parameter for it.
