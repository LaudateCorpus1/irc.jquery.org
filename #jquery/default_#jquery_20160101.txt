[02:58:22] <neha> Hey guys! HAppy New Year.
[02:58:22] <neha> Actually m stuck to Jquerry problem.
[02:58:22] <neha> I have created to navbars with different names. And i  have used "selected" class for selecting options in navbars.
[02:58:22] <neha> i want to use REMOVE and ADDCLASS function such that
[02:58:22] <neha> if i click on one option on 1rst navbar and then on the  2nd navbar both get selected. (only one option can get selected on single navbar)
[04:15:51] <durwasa> what is the difference between (function(){        } () ) ; and (function(){             }) ();
[04:34:11] <durwasa> what is the difference between (function(){        } () ) ; and (function(){             }) (); ?
[04:35:13] <durwasa> sorry got the answer at SO ... :)
[04:56:22] <yanchai> hi guys
[04:56:49] <yanchai> anyone here would like to help me on my image slider?
[05:00:43] <yanchai> Happy New Year
[05:33:23] <wa5ted> yanchai: whats the issue
[05:33:26] <wa5ted> somehow im still up
[07:01:53] <shibly> How can i develop facebook like commenting system? Like load comment div with new comments or load the status div with new status
[07:15:58] <wa5ted> shibly: the most basic way
[07:16:15] <wa5ted> have a set time interval function that periodically checks for new objects i tneh data model
[07:17:45] <shibly> wa5ted: setInterval has huge overhead request
[07:18:23] <wa5ted> hence my preamble suggesting that it is basic
[07:18:29] <wa5ted> the otiher option is to do a lazy load
[07:18:34] <wa5ted> shibly: ^
[07:18:51] <shibly> What is lazy load?
[07:24:04] <K4T> it means that resource will be loaded only when is needed
[07:28:02] <shibly> Yes, lazy load seems good, does facebook use lazy load?
[08:18:52] <svineet> hi, is it insecure to receive recaptcha responses through GET?
[09:07:38] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to populate a select2 dinamically from ajax query https://jsfiddle.net/js75s5w1/, but the select2 is not cleared before populated it. Any suggestion please?
[09:12:46] <DukeDrake> hi

[11:52:59] <AcidCell> Hello
[11:53:22] <AcidCell> http://pastebin.com/hapXeNCq can someone tell me why "1" is not being alerted? This was just working like 5min ago :/
[11:53:43] <AcidCell> I fear I have a parse error somewhere
[12:00:31] <AcidCell> Anyone?
[12:38:44] <Jakey3> what is are the ways of creating a login and registration on jquery mobile with php
[12:39:01] <Jakey3> are there plugins to do this to?
[13:22:15] <Geh4> Quick quesiton on Keypress events. is it possible to press a button using the keypress, every Stackover flow topic is about input boxes and all I want to do it press a button when I press a letter on the keyboard.
[14:05:43] <arc_> Geh4 when you say press a button do you mean an html button or a keyboard key
[14:06:24] <Geh4> Pressing an html button with a keyboard key
[14:06:39] <arc_> that's basically just a keyboard shortcut
[14:06:48] <arc_> plenty of ways to do that
[14:07:07] <arc_> just bind an input event listener and test for which key is being pressed and then create your logic from there
[14:07:10] <Geh4> This is great news, Iv'e been at this for the last hour trying to understand how it work
[14:08:07] <arc_> sorry i shouldn't say input, since that refers specifically to input elements. the keyboard ones are keyup and keydown
[14:09:09] <arc_> probably the easiest way to do it would just be to use jquery hotkeys http://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys
[14:09:30] <Geh4> Iv'e noticed that every single page on this feautre is for input boxes and alerts. I'll send over a fiddle now to show what I'm trying to do.
[14:09:32] <arc_> but it's obviously possible to redo that if you're concerned with bloat
[14:10:30] <arc_> well, that's probably because you're searching for the wrong thing. it's a bit of a tricky thing to search for
[14:10:40] <arc_> when you aren't fully familiar with the terminology
[14:15:40] <Geh4> https://jsfiddle.net/gxk7fd26/1/
[14:16:51] <arc_> this is behaving very strangely
[14:17:05] <Geh4> I must've gone all the way to page 5 in the google search, I haven't gone past a second page in years.
[14:17:07] <Geh4> how so ?
[14:17:43] <arc_> i'm not sure what it's supposed to be doing, but it seems like clicking the button should make it toggle the rotation on and off?
[14:17:57] <Geh4> correct
[14:18:19] <arc_> instead, clicking the button makes it do some more exaggerated rotation, and it keeps rotating regardless
[14:18:46] <arc_> and after that point, whether it rotates or not seems to be based on whether my mouse cursor is hovering over the button
[14:19:16] <arc_> ah ok you have a hover in your css
[14:19:32] <arc_> all right well i won't worry about that
[14:19:53] <Geh4> I know i can make it toggle instead, but I have other plans for this keypress feature and more buttons will be added, so the keyboard press must only click the button.
[14:20:02] <Geh4> I do, ah
[14:20:05] <arc_> if you want keyCode 80, whatever that is, to trigger the rotate button, you can either just use the javascript click() method, or you can use the jquery trigger method
[14:20:22] <arc_> since you already have an event listener bound to that button
[14:21:19] <Geh4> so how would that look ?
[14:21:40] <Geh4> I tried that a while back, and nothing happened, I must've done something wrong.
[14:23:19] <arc_> what is keycode 80
[14:23:24] <Geh4> letter P
[14:26:24] <arc_> okay, well first of all i don't know if you realize but it's case sensitive so that would basically mean the keyboard shortcut is shift+P
[14:27:05] <arc_> it took me a minute to figure out why it wasn't doing anything
[14:27:12] <Geh4> oh, this is my error. I will only be using a lower case letter p.
[14:28:28] <arc_> actually, ... this is strange? it doesn't seem to actually be case sensitive, but it only works for me if i hold shift
[14:29:17] <Geh4> you'er right
[14:29:22] <Geh4> *You're
[14:29:25] <Geh4> wow
[14:30:00] <arc_> idk, someone else here probably knows why that is, but i don't
[14:30:18] <arc_> regardless, the simplest way to do what you want is to just put $('#ouch2').click();
[14:31:10] <Geh4> so the end script is ...
[14:31:12] <Geh4>  $(document).keypress(function(e) {
[14:31:19] <Geh4> if (event.keyCode == 80) {
[14:31:24] <Geh4> $('#ouch2').click();
[14:31:28] <Geh4>   }
[14:31:31] <Geh4> });
[14:31:38] <Geh4> correct ?
[14:31:51] <arc_> well, it's recommended to use event.which instead of event.keyCode
[14:32:01] <arc_> but yes
[14:33:10] <arc_> you can also do $('#ouch2').trigger('click');
[14:33:19] <arc_> which triggers the already existing click event
[14:33:20] <Geh4> Oh, which doc are you reading ? I would like to see the examples.
[14:33:23] <arc_> without having to actually click on it
[14:33:46] <arc_> but i honestly don't know what the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are
[14:34:10] <arc_> i'm not reading anything at the moment
[14:34:25] <arc_> if you want to read about how trigger() works, this page will help http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:34:45] <arc_> click() is a vanilla javascript method so that's here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click
[14:38:12] <Geh4> Great, thanks for your help. I just curious why this works at all if I have nothing after    if (event.keyCode == 80) {
[14:38:38] <arc_> what do you mean by that
[14:39:37] <Geh4> you encouraged me to use  $('#ouch2').trigger('click'); which would have been the last piece to making this actually work, but it works without it, why ?
[14:40:26] <arc_> if i comment that line out, it doesn't do anything when i press P
[14:40:34] <arc_> so what do you mean when you say it works without it?
[14:40:56] <Geh4> well, not with "p"
[14:41:05] <Geh4> but shift + p works
[14:41:12] <Geh4> which remians a mystery
[14:41:21] <Geh4> but it still rotates
[14:41:21] <arc_> neither triggers the effect of clicking the button for me
[14:41:57] <arc_> what exactly does "it works" mean
[14:42:30] <Geh4> when press shift + p, the object rotates as if I had pressed the button.
[14:43:45] <arc_> idk. my best explanation is that you deleted the line that clicks the button, but you didn't click run or update on jsfiddle, so it's still running as if that line ist here even though it has been deleted
[14:44:12] <arc_> if i comment out that line and click run, pressing shift+p doesn't do anything
[14:46:55] <Geh4> On sec... just doing some quick testing
[14:49:06] <Geh4> do you think this would have anything to do with the browser. I'm on chrome. I just threw the same code in a different fiddle and it worked, but only with shift. I'll send it over.
[14:49:55] <arc_> i am also on chrome
[14:59:14] <Geh4> sorry for this delay, something odd is preventing this fiddle from working, it's only working code pen, so I'll link you to that instread.
[14:59:57] <arc_> np
[15:00:13] <arc_> btw, apparently i was right and it is case sensitive, but i wasn't able to find the keycode for lowercase p until now. it's 112, not 80
[15:00:46] <Geh4> wow,
[15:00:57] <Geh4> iv'e been mislead ^ ^''
[15:00:57] <Geh4> http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes
[15:01:15] <arc_> yeah
[15:04:29] <arc_> it also wouldn't surprise me if someone comes in later and says actually it's not case sensitive, it's just a quirk of something or other with keypress events
[15:05:39] <Geh4> their must be a difference somewhere, iv'e read numerous time on Stackoverflow that it wasn't case senseitve, but as you said, some charts show other wise,
[15:05:40] <Geh4> http://www.theasciicode.com.ar/ascii-printable-characters/lowercase-letter-p-minuscule-ascii-code-112.html
[15:07:33] <arc_> an ascii chart isn't really what you need to be looking at for javascript keycodes
[15:09:13] <Geh4> Hmm, it appears that most, if not all charts showing 112 as lowercase p; are from ascii charts.
[15:10:07] <arc_> i mean they correspond, but ascii predates javascript by quite a long time, so an ascii chart isn't going to help explain this discrepancy
[15:12:06] <Geh4> http://codepen.io/Geh4/pen/JGEGNw
[15:13:51] <arc_> seems to work
[15:14:49] <Geh4> Indeed, very nice ! you've been much help ! This seems to only work in Codepen for what ever reason.
[15:16:42] <Geh4> Oh
[15:16:46] <Geh4> I see what it is
[15:17:04] <Geh4> It's    keydown  vs keypress
[15:17:42] <Geh4> keydown is not case sensitive.
[15:19:52] <arc_> i tried to look up what the difference between those is, but it didn't seem to really say anything specific about case sensitivity
[15:20:59] <Geh4> this is what I found
[15:21:00] <Geh4> http://howtodoinjava.com/2013/12/20/jquery-difference-between-keypress-and-keydown-events/
[15:21:09] <arc_> i guess it's because keypress is triggered on a character being typed, not on a keyboard key being pressed
[15:22:01] <Geh4> It reads as an Ascii value when using keypress
[17:02:00] <JSzero> hi
[19:37:40] <THIS-NICK-SUCKS> hey
[19:38:46] <THIS-NICK-SUCKS> oh fix my problem
[22:54:12] <shibly> If someone commenst the comment div will be updated like facebook comment div, how can i do this?
[23:20:40] <Trinity> how does JQuery do it's slideDown() function?
[23:21:02] <Trinity> how does it work behind the scenes? I looked at the source and it seems it's using animate() but i'm not sure what values it's being given
[23:29:12] <kanyin> quit
