[01:34:21] <shesmu> i have a string looking like this <a href="foobar">foo</a> being returned by a jquery selector, how can i just pull the href?
[01:34:43] <shesmu> i tried .attr('href') but i am getting an error
[01:41:09] <Uhkis> shesmu: what's the error?
[01:42:25] <shesmu> Uhkis: unhandled rejection. I am running the jquery through a sperate plugin but i have access to all jquery functions
[01:42:41] <shesmu> Uhkis: the error boils down to 'you messed up your pointer'
[01:43:12] <Uhkis> O_O
[01:43:36] <Uhkis> can you show the code?
[01:44:58] <shesmu> Uhkis: http://pastebin.com/m76FCuBa
[01:46:00] <shesmu> Uhkis: if i dont use .attr everything is fine but putting that on causes the problems.
[01:48:13] <Uhkis> that html() in there causes the problem
[01:48:28] <Uhkis> html() returns a string, not a jquery object
[01:48:56] <shesmu> without it im getting undefined, what should i replace it with?
[01:49:55] <Uhkis> then your selector is wrong
[01:50:47] <Uhkis> and .size() is deprecated since jquery 1.8
[01:50:56] <Uhkis> just use .length
[01:52:27] <shesmu> Uhkis: but the selector returns exactly what i would expect, its the #shopAllLinks one
[01:54:02] <shesmu> Uhkis: how can the selector be wrong?
[01:56:06] <Uhkis> never tried that horseman, but you should probably have something like var jqueryable = $(datain); and do .find() in that
[01:56:13] <Uhkis> just guessing though
[01:57:55] <Uhkis> is the $(selector) the right jquery object? (or jquery object at all)
[02:54:16] <hellyeah> hey
[03:26:52] <skywater> hi
[03:26:54] <skywater> hi, anyone got a idea for this If have a list with in it items as follows: Itemcode:234 Description:test.. These are wrapped between div and a. If i click this item then it will execute a function, this must split the ItemCode and Description, but the problem is I dont want to split on ¨:¨ because an description can also contain a :. Anyone any idea? code example: http://codepaste.net/rhgfze
[03:40:12] <konrados> skywater: find first space (indexOf) and then use the substring function?
[03:44:41] <hellyeah> anyone around_?
[03:50:35] <krpt> Hi, I've got a bunch of draggable element on my page, I want to save their position/size after the user does its interaction, I use the dragstop event to call a php page that save them in a json file, that works well, now how would I read this json file to display the user created page ? thx
[03:52:45] <krpt> Maybe I should save the entire div html in the ajax call and display it 'as is' when reading .. more simple ?
[03:57:02] <hellyeah> hey
[03:57:09] <hellyeah> i need help about datepicker
[03:57:14] <hellyeah> someone can help me?
[03:58:36] <krpt> you better ask away, but it's not very crowdy I'm afraid
[04:03:23] <hellyeah> let me try my chance
[04:04:21] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/1/  hey i have this. I  try to select datepicker title i can do that with  $('.ui-datepicker-title')  but what i want is to select datepicker title with $('.from') because i have more then one datepicker. And i have to do seperate things with each title i am binding event.  How can i select datepicker-title seperately for '.from' and '.to'  Here is my origina
[04:05:41] <krpt> .. select with an id combined ? ' .yourclass #id ' ?
[04:06:21] <krpt> hellyeah:
[04:20:40] <krpt> hellyeah:  this : https://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[04:53:18] <Sagar> i have a url http://localhost/demo/wp/p/71/some-post which can also be http://localhost/demo/wp/p/71/some-post?someString or http://localhost/demo/wp/p/71/some-post#string, how do i take out 71 from the url?
[05:12:43] <AdamPDotty> url.split('/')[6]
[05:22:24] <FilipNortic> or /\d+/.exec(url));
[05:24:26] <Sagar> FilipNortic, wouldn't that take our all the numbers?
[05:24:39] <Sagar> assume if the url has  http://localhost/demo/wp/p/71/some-post#string=383883hdh
[05:27:01] <FilipNortic> in an array yes so the first match would be [0]
[05:29:46] <FilipNortic> Sagar: wait that only picks the first i think
[05:39:35] <Sagar> not the exec regex you gave right?
[05:41:12] <FilipNortic> I tend to get a bit confued with all the regex dialect out there but you should have to add a g somewhere to make it get more than 1 match
[05:43:23] <FilipNortic> Sagar: https://jsfiddle.net/eLhjg86p/
[05:43:46] * AdamPDotty born to consufe
[05:51:19] <Sagar> array
[05:51:28] <Sagar> i could do that
[05:51:58] <Sagar> FilipNortic which array number should it be?
[05:52:13] <FilipNortic> 0 if allways the first
[05:52:32] <FilipNortic> so if you now there is no numbers before it should be 0
[05:53:26] <FilipNortic> in the fiddle example i added the 1 before just to get some mote numbers
[05:53:35] <FilipNortic> more*
[05:55:26] <Sagar> can u make a full example for me to take 71 out?
[06:02:01] <FilipNortic> Sagar: seld and
[06:02:10] <FilipNortic> seld and
[06:02:29] <FilipNortic> Sagar: https://jsfiddle.net/eLhjg86p/3/
[06:02:54] <FilipNortic> this only works if you know 71 is the first number in the string
[06:03:19] <FilipNortic> else you have to play around with the regex a bit to se what works for you
[06:07:30] <AdamPDotty> so why again use a regex?
[06:17:21] <FilipNortic> AdamPDotty: if the place of the number never shifts there is no real reson if it dies then you need to
[06:19:29] <AdamPDotty> everything dies, baby, that's a fact
[06:19:54] <AdamPDotty> There was nothing in the question to indicate a possible position shift.
[06:47:05] <hellyeah> krpt:  sorry i was away i check url you gave
[06:48:03] <hellyeah> krpt:  still there?
[06:48:22] <hellyeah> this is not exactly what i am looking for
[06:48:29] <hellyeah> ah
[06:48:51] <hellyeah> it can be
[06:50:57] <hellyeah> no
[06:51:02] <hellyeah> it is not
[06:51:03] <hellyeah> or
[06:51:05] <hellyeah> ah
[06:51:10] <hellyeah> sorry
[06:51:11] <hellyeah> :p
[06:55:04] <hellyeah> krpt:  thanks
[07:20:58] <FilipNortic> AdamPDotty: if the place of the number never shifts there is no real reson if it dies then you need to
[07:21:14] <FilipNortic> sry about that
[07:21:21] <hellyeah> hey i want to bind a click event to ui-datepicker-title but no luck. Can you help me to figure out what it happened like that? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/3/
[07:22:36] <taplar> were you not doing that in your other fiddle?
[07:22:59] <hellyeah> no
[07:23:09] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[07:23:19] <hellyeah> i mea in other fiddle i just did that form ".from"
[07:23:23] <taplar> you were clicking the title area to make the months and years dialog show up
[07:23:30] <hellyeah> at this time i have more than one datepicker
[07:23:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  right but my purpose is kinda different here
[07:23:54] <hellyeah> i can have more then one datepicker like .from and .to
[07:24:03] <taplar> but your asking how to bind a click to something, which you seem to have done before
[07:24:18] <taplar> so what are you really asking
[07:24:30] <hellyeah> taplar:  line 6-8 works
[07:24:38] <hellyeah> line 12-14 not
[07:24:50] <taplar> those lines don't exist in this fiddle
[07:24:58] <hellyeah> damn
[07:25:27] <hellyeah> i updated i dont understand i think jsfiddle has some serious issues
[07:25:42] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/5/
[07:26:08] <hellyeah> does it exist now?
[07:26:56] <taplar> yes
[07:27:35] <hellyeah> ah okey
[07:27:47] <hellyeah> i select input box with different way
[07:27:51] <taplar> y?
[07:28:10] <hellyeah> i need to reach ui-datepicker-title
[07:28:11] <hellyeah> so
[07:28:32] <taplar> doesn't explain why your selecting on an attribute instead of just using the class
[07:28:47] <hellyeah> $('input[value = from]').find('.ui-datepicker-title') not doing the trick
[07:28:58] <hellyeah> let me try
[07:29:00] <taplar> not answering my question
[07:29:14] <hellyeah> i saw your question afdter typing :D
[07:29:28] <hellyeah> i have two input box .from and .to
[07:29:45] <hellyeah> both has datepicker-title i want to bind an event to both
[07:29:45] <taplar> still not answering my question, :)
[07:29:59] <hellyeah> those will do seperate things
[07:30:05] <taplar> no
[07:30:11] <taplar> your selecting the same element
[07:30:12] <hellyeah> so i need to select datepicker-title seperately
[07:30:13] <hellyeah> no?
[07:30:17] <taplar> just now your selecting it inefficently
[07:30:27] <hellyeah> just a sec
[07:30:28] <FilipNortic> and even if you can add another class
[07:30:34] <FilipNortic> if so*
[07:31:04] <taplar> also if you right click on the input and inspect it, you'll see that the datepicker is not nested.  it is a sibling
[07:31:20] <taplar> and if you add another datepicker and initialize it, there is still only one datepicker element
[07:31:31] <taplar> it reuses it for all the datepickers most likely
[07:32:37] <taplar> which makes sense.  only one of those bad boys should be visible at any given time
[07:32:41] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/6/
[07:33:01] <taplar> yep
[07:33:10] <taplar> inspect your element dude
[07:33:24] <hellyeah> i undyeah i know ui-datepicker-title is not nested,
[07:33:32] <hellyeah> find is not useful here
[07:33:37] <jose3_> Hello World!
[07:33:45] <hellyeah> but i need to seperate those with some ways
[07:33:53] <jose3_> can I comnine multiple .empty()'s ?
[07:33:58] <taplar> your not going to get two of those using the plugin
[07:34:09] <taplar> jose3_: 'combine'?
[07:34:13] <jose3_> yes
[07:34:21] <hellyeah> empty().empty().empty()
[07:34:22] <hellyeah> ?
[07:34:22] <taplar> you mean empty multiple elements?
[07:34:33] <jose3_> yes
[07:34:41] <jose3_> how can I clean this up?
[07:34:46] <taplar> $('selector1, selector2').empty()
[07:34:56] <hellyeah> just empty() root element
[07:34:58] <jose3_> oh okay let me try
[07:34:58] <taplar> or $(selector1).add(jQuery object).empty()
[07:35:02] <hellyeah> it will clean up all childs
[07:35:08] <hellyeah> right?
[07:35:16] <taplar> maybe he doesn't want to remove that much
[07:35:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:35:26] <hellyeah> can be
[07:35:42] <jose3_> this is what I want to refactor
[07:35:48] <hellyeah> detach() method can be used instead of empty() ?
[07:35:51] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/wKxxhBlH/
[07:36:15] <taplar> sure, but unless you want to keep the stuff it doesn't matter
[07:36:15] <jose3_> sorry those are appends
[07:36:24] <hellyeah> taplar:  i need to assign different thing to different datepicker-title so you said it is not meaning
[07:36:27] <hellyeah> ops
[07:36:34] <taplar> you can't do that yo
[07:36:34] <hellyeah> it is not possible
[07:36:40] <taplar> there is only one datepicker
[07:36:42] <hellyeah> thats bad
[07:36:52] <jose3_> ?
[07:36:53] <hellyeah> thats really bad
[07:37:14] <hellyeah> you can keep stuff in variable with detach method for later use
[07:37:46] <hellyeah> i think between remove(), empty() or detach(), most usable method is detach()
[07:37:52] <hellyeah> just amateur opinion
[07:38:11] <jose3_> okay ill read about that then
[07:38:12] <jose3_> thanks
[07:38:26] <taplar> i wouldn't agree really
[07:38:43] <taplar> they're all pretty equal, just different use cases
[07:38:45] <jose3_> I mean i make a call like this:  $(".all").detach();
[07:39:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are master
[07:39:04] <jose3_> it does the same thing, so for me the difference is only in preformance?
[07:39:17] <hellyeah> jose3_:  yeah read about those
[07:39:20] <jose3_> okay
[07:39:24] <taplar> detach will remove the element itself
[07:39:29] <taplar> not remove all children
[07:39:31] <hellyeah> var smt = selector.detach()
[07:39:39] <hellyeah> taplar:  understood
[07:39:58] <hellyeah> but if you remove root it will wipe all childeren right?
[07:40:07] <taplar> then you have to recreate the root
[07:40:12] <taplar> why do that?
[07:40:18] <hellyeah> just asking
[07:40:22] <taplar> if all you want to do is remove the children
[07:40:24] <hellyeah> try to learn stuff :)
[07:40:38] <hellyeah> selector.childeren().remove()
[07:40:44] <taplar> plus by detaching the root, you've lost where it was placed
[07:40:50] <taplar> selector.empty()
[07:40:53] <taplar> -_-
[07:41:00] <hellyeah> selector.empty()
[07:41:04] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:41:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:41:16] <taplar> you seem to have a hate for empty, :P
[07:41:42] <hellyeah> empty sounds like erasing context instead of removing title
[07:41:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:42:04] <taplar> uh
[07:42:05] <hellyeah> i dont know jquery has close method
[07:42:07] <jose3_> It IS empty i want
[07:42:07] <hellyeah> i couldnt ocover use cases now
[07:42:11] <taplar> nothing inherently about empty has anything to do with a 'title'
[07:42:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  it is metaphor
[07:42:28] <hellyeah> title = element
[07:42:33] <taplar> talk literals, :P
[07:42:43] <hellyeah> sorry :P:P:P
[07:43:24] <hellyeah> taplar:  briefly you said there is only one datepicker and it is re-used
[07:43:30] <taplar> yup
[07:43:31] <hellyeah> did i understand true?
[07:43:34] <hellyeah> okey
[07:43:40] <hellyeah> that make sense actually
[07:43:58] <hellyeah> so there is no way to select ui-datepicker-title seperately
[07:44:03] <hellyeah> nice i understood
[07:44:04] <taplar> only one
[07:44:36] <hellyeah> so how can i do this seperation i dont know
[07:44:44] <hellyeah> because i have to input box
[07:45:15] <hellyeah> two*
[07:45:58] <taplar> think about manipulating the one datepicker when an input is clicked/focused
[07:45:59] <hellyeah> does datepicker have an option to create two or more datepicker accoding to amount of input boxes?
[07:46:13] <taplar> you'd have to look at the docs for that
[07:46:25] <hellyeah> i need to search for it
[07:46:30] <hellyeah> yes
[07:46:50] <hellyeah> they always want custom logic
[07:46:51] <taplar> but i have a feeling probably not
[07:47:07] <hellyeah> i didnt see something for that also i read api
[07:48:48] <taplar> so like i said, think about manipulating the single datepicker when an input is clicked/focused
[07:49:34] <hellyeah> $('.from').datepicker()
[07:49:59] <hellyeah> is manipualating datepicker when you click inputbox no?
[07:50:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:50:25] <taplar> that's the initialization
[07:51:29] <hellyeah> i can do
[07:51:42] <hellyeah> like trying to find this class after initialization
[07:51:52] <hellyeah> so i can do seperation
[07:51:52] <taplar> the datepicker has an id on it
[07:52:45] <hellyeah> this is is constantly changing
[07:53:05] <hellyeah> in my original work, you can create 100*.from and .to
[07:53:33] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/18/
[07:53:34] <taplar> well, now that's just you scaring yourself, :P
[07:54:09] <hellyeah> i found smt let me ask away
[07:54:48] <hellyeah> var widget = $('selector').datepicker('widget'); and widget.find('.ui-datepicker-title');
[07:54:57] <hellyeah> widget returns jquery object with datepicker
[07:55:15] <hellyeah> so i have datepicicker elements with child as jquery object
[07:55:24] <taplar> $from.datepicker(); var $datepickerDiv = $('#ui-datepicker-div');
[07:55:25] <hellyeah> i can use jquery methods to traverse tree
[07:55:29] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[07:56:01] <hellyeah> #ui-datepicker-div?
[07:56:15] <taplar> inspect your dom dude
[07:56:15] <hellyeah> i dont think dom tree has this?
[07:56:20] <taplar> -_-
[07:56:36] <taplar> cause i enjoy lieing to you?
[07:56:59] <hellyeah> aha
[07:57:01] <hellyeah> :XD
[07:57:33] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:57:47] <hellyeah> i understand
[07:58:22] <taplar> datepicker("widget") gets you the same thing as the id selector
[07:58:28] <taplar> you just don't have to know it's id that way
[07:58:53] <hellyeah> so at least my guess and understand seems correct
[07:59:30] <taplar> so now consider what you can do to it when you focus on an input
[08:02:46] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/7/ why it doesnt work for title
[08:03:28] <hellyeah> damn
[08:03:52] <taplar> seriously dude, change your selectors back
[08:04:00] <taplar> it's hurting my brain, lol
[08:05:00] <taplar> and i don't believe the second argument to a delegate binding can be anything other than a string
[08:05:11] <hellyeah> okey but ui-datepicker-title is child of ui-datepicker-div
[08:05:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:06:09] <hellyeah> title thing works here https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/x1j739pt/
[08:06:20] <hellyeah> but anyway i need to take some break for a min
[08:07:09] <taplar> the title thing in that one is not trying to use an object as part of it's delegate filtering
[08:08:12] <jose3_> hello gents- while yall are on the topic of dates:
[08:08:20] <jose3_> I have a statement like this: if( $(this).val() == 'past_due'){
[08:08:44] <jose3_> what is the EASIEST quickest way to compare "THIS" to anything in the past
[08:08:56] <jose3_> I do not want to use a library
[08:09:06] <taplar> 'this' is entirely contextual.  need more details
[08:09:16] <jose3_> basically anything older than today
[08:09:28] <taplar> what is 'this'?
[08:09:56] <jose3_> a date
[08:10:02] <jose3_> any date
[08:10:06] <taplar> a Date or a date string?
[08:10:32] <jose3_> a fate string
[08:10:34] <jose3_> date
[08:10:39] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/492994/compare-two-dates-with-javascript
[08:11:14] <jose3_> thanks
[08:11:15] <taplar> be aware though that that is going to be based off of whatever the date is on the user's pc
[08:11:48] <jose3_> okay...
[08:12:04] <jose3_> this is for internal use... so I don't think its a big issue?
[08:12:32] <taplar> *shrugs* depends on what your using it for and how secure you need it to be.  you'd need to validate it on the backend regardless.
[08:49:41] <FancyCamel> Uh, hey there, I've currently got a $('.foo').each(function(){//A bunch of things}; going on. But now I'm wanting to create the same functionality with a different class selector. A bunch of variables in the function are going to change based on the selector. My question is how I construct this function to be used for if I go $('.foo') or $('.bar') when selecting. I was trying to Google it but I must not be searching the right stuff beca
[08:49:41] <FancyCamel> use I just get pointed to .each, haha.
[08:50:22] <FancyCamel> I've seen like var functionname = function(){} used before but I don't really know the use case on those or if that's what I'm lookin' for here.
[08:50:43] <nindustries> Hi guys, can I do this? $('#plan*Text').text('');
[08:50:56] <nindustries> e.g. plan01Text, plan02Text
[08:51:45] <jose3_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ByKp3eak/
[08:52:09] <jose3_> but in chrome this is kicking me the error VM90956:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'CompletionDate' of undefined(…)
[08:54:47] <taplar> FancyCamel: other than where you get the variables from, is the logic the same?
[08:55:12] <taplar> nindustries: no, you'd have to break it up
[08:55:44] <FancyCamel> Almost identical, yeah, taplar. Just things changing like different id's being targetted and stuff but they're even named similarly. (eg. foo-pagination vs bar-pagination)
[08:56:04] <taplar> $('[id^="plan"][id$="Text"]') , however a better approach would be to put a common class on them all
[08:56:13] <nindustries> hm
[08:56:38] <nindustries> Thing is I'm generating a portion of divs in my php code. When the user selects one, I need to do something on the rest
[08:56:38] <taplar> FancyCamel: then i'd do your selectors inside your each and pass them in as parameters to another function that does the work
[08:56:52] <nindustries> so I thought; remove classes from all and add to the selected
[08:57:16] <nindustries> <? foreach $divs; ?> $('div_x').onClick(..) </foreach>
[08:57:47] <taplar> you can put the # as a data-* field and use that if you want
[08:58:01] <taplar> otherwise you could also do $('.class').not(this) to get the 'others'
[08:58:08] <Baako> hi http://kopy.io/ww4gQ php is return a text of "0.50" but in javascript the console.log doesnt seem to be showing it but shows a blank line in console BUT if i change the return $cardcharge to echo $cardchange Card.data shows it
[08:59:27] <taplar> Baako: if your returning an array you need to json_encode it
[08:59:45] <Baako> taplar, i am not returning an array
[09:00:23] <Baako> $row["value"] returns a value in the array so what u am returning is this 0.50
[09:01:39] <Baako> taplar, what i dont seem to understand is if i change the return $cardcharge to echo $cardchange. d then becomes 0.50
[09:02:23] <taplar> oh, lol
[09:03:01] <taplar> that's more of a php question, but return returns the result to the calling method, it doesn't write it out to the STDOUT, which is what writes back to the requestor in a php http request
[09:03:40] <taplar> echo writes out to the STDOUT, of course
[09:03:55] <Baako> but return doesn't
[09:04:34] <taplar> return will return the result to the calling PHP method, not ajax.  they're not in the same domian
[09:04:37] <taplar> *domain
[09:04:56] <taplar> hit up ##php if you have more questions about that
[09:07:16] <Baako> thanks taplar
[09:17:36] <hellyeah> hey
[09:18:00] <hellyeah> it doesnt except $datepickerDiv you have to give strings why variable doesnt work here https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/10/
[09:20:39] <hellyeah> accept
[09:20:40] <hellyeah> *
[09:23:15] <taplar> cause that's the way it's written dude
[09:23:33] <taplar> if you had the variable, why would you need a delegate?
[09:35:31] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[09:35:45] <taplar> ?
[09:35:50] <hellyeah> hey taplar
[09:35:55] <hellyeah> how ya doin mate
[09:36:21] <taplar> decent
[09:36:32] <hellyeah> sounds good to my ear
[09:37:02] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/11/ it didnt accept variable you can just give string. Do you have any other advice to bind click event to a div?
[09:37:44] <taplar> already said earlier, twice, to look into manipulating the datepicker when you focus on an input
[09:38:31] <hellyeah> actually i dont know what you mean by manipulating the datepicker can you give me small example?
[09:38:50] <taplar> add a class or something to it
[09:39:00] <hellyeah> if you dont mind
[09:39:04] <hellyeah> addClass
[09:39:09] <hellyeah> humm
[09:39:11] <hellyeah> aha
[09:39:24] <taplar> your wanting to do two different things depending on if it's .from or .to
[09:39:30] <hellyeah> datepicker add smt for adding class iirc
[09:39:36] <taplar> so put something on it that lets it know which it is focused on
[09:39:46] <taplar> and then let the delegate(s) do their work
[09:41:06] <hellyeah> so addClass to datepicker?
[09:41:06] <hellyeah> add class to .from and .to
[09:41:18] <taplar> just the datepicker
[09:42:07] <hellyeah> i just want to make sure :D
[09:42:18] <hellyeah> aha
[09:42:27] <hellyeah> no
[09:42:28] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:43:03] <hellyeah> i wonder smt
[09:45:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w19xmbbq/13/
[09:46:10] <hellyeah> taplar:  yo yo yo https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/14/
[09:46:19] <hellyeah> does it seem correct? :DD
[09:46:30] <taplar> no
[09:46:33] <taplar> look at /13
[09:46:40] <krpt> Still on the same question hellyeah ? :p
[09:47:15] <hellyeah> krpt:  not continiously
[09:47:17] <hellyeah> :p
[09:48:54] <hellyeah> .fromFocused
[09:48:57] <hellyeah> .toFocused
[09:49:00] <hellyeah> :p
[09:49:15] <taplar> or whatever you want to name them
[09:49:34] <hellyeah> those doesnt exist
[09:49:38] <taplar> not yet
[09:49:38] <hellyeah> i dont understand that
[09:49:46] <taplar> as the comment says, make it work
[09:49:55] <taplar> i'm not going to write the whole solution for you dudue
[09:49:57] <taplar> *dude
[09:50:55] <hellyeah> my way also works
[09:50:57] <hellyeah> YAY
[09:51:08] <hellyeah> i make it work
[09:51:09] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[09:51:19] <hellyeah> sec
[09:51:37] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/w19xmbbq/16/
[09:51:59] <taplar> i give up
[09:52:06] <hellyeah> but it worked
[09:52:13] <hellyeah> is that all wrong?
[09:52:33] <taplar> if it works, cool. keep going
[09:52:43] <krpt> :D .. take a break hellyeah , re read yourself in a litte while, you're too much in it
[09:53:08] <hellyeah> okey
[09:53:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  thank you. You are always supportive
[09:53:35] <hellyeah> seems it worked if it will be mess later
[09:53:37] <hellyeah> let me see it
[09:53:46] <hellyeah> that the way of learning :)
[09:54:01] <taplar> you've yet to do anything with other events
[09:54:11] <taplar> and your only doing it for one of them
[09:54:33] <taplar> i'm trying to point you to a solution but your not following
[09:54:42] <taplar> can you understand how frustrating that is?
[09:54:58] <hellyeah> you said adding class to datepicker
[09:55:02] <taplar> with events
[09:55:09] <hellyeah> because datepicker is only one
[09:55:09] <taplar> when you focus on the inputs
[09:55:13] <taplar> i've now said that 4 times
[09:56:03] <hellyeah> i need to take some breathe
[09:56:24] <hellyeah> when you focus on the inpput i guess you mean when you click inputs right
[09:56:36] <taplar> click is one way to get focus, yes
[09:56:49] <taplar> but focus also accounts for other things like tabs
[09:57:21] <taplar> anything that results in the cursor being put in the input
[09:57:26] <taplar> for the most part
[09:57:40] <hellyeah> let me think later
[09:57:53] <hellyeah> sometimes my brain stops :p
[10:22:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:22:24] <hellyeah> if i dont talk no one talks
[10:22:25] <hellyeah> ehehehe
[10:25:06] <hellyeah> okey i saw the wrong things
[10:25:07] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[10:28:20] <skywater> hi
[10:28:26] <taplar> aloha
[10:29:12] <skywater> i have a <li> element with a solid border, if i click this <li> then the border will become blue and radius, this i do not want i want it to stay default but i want that the bg color changes anyone knows how to fix this>
[10:29:15] <skywater> ?
[10:31:00] <taplar> i take it your changing the border with a click event?
[10:31:37] <skywater> no i actually dont
[10:32:04] <taplar> so first step would be to find out what's doing that
[10:32:53] <skywater> ye i think i remove the border xD
[11:06:50] <el_inventor> Hi
[11:07:06] <el_inventor> I ned help
[11:07:10] <el_inventor> *need
[11:07:18] <taplar> ask away
[11:09:23] <el_inventor> I'm working with this custom dropdown list
[11:09:24] <el_inventor> http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/04/custom-drop-down-list-styling/
[11:11:05] <el_inventor> I'm using it for create dinamics menus
[11:12:20] <el_inventor> but doesn't work when I create a new element
[11:13:09] <el_inventor> only when I reload the page
[11:13:11] <taplar> what new element are you creating?
[11:14:34] <el_inventor> I've created a list like this http://dpaste.com/320FJ3A
[11:14:55] <taplar> so the whole shebang
[11:15:36] <taplar> if so you'll have to run your initialization on that element after you've created it
[11:15:36] <el_inventor> using the javascript like the page say
[11:16:33] <el_inventor> http://dpaste.com/1Y9MSJW
[11:17:33] <el_inventor> taplar: http://dpaste.com/1Y9MSJW
[11:17:40] <_TWG_> I've read in a JSON file into a variable.  Now I'm needing to check if the the item.categories contains a specific word. It's an array that can contain many values.
[11:18:00] <taplar> _TWG_: indexOf
[11:18:28] <_TWG_> so I would do an if statement of item.categories.indefOf = "" ?
[11:18:30] <taplar> basic array method
[11:18:48] <taplar> google "mdn Array.prototype.indexOf"
[11:19:58] <_TWG_> taplar.  Awesome.  Thanks.
[11:22:55] <_TWG_> taplar do you think you could help me with wrapping my head around what logical steps I need to do to work with an array of GeoJSON data?
[11:23:26] <taplar> sure, throw the array in a fiddle or something
[11:26:08] <_TWG_> This is the basic look of my JSON data. http://kopy.io/yRQ7y
[11:26:29] <_TWG_> Crap I forgot to add my categories.  Give me just a second.
[11:28:36] <_TWG_> taplar here is my JSON data.  http://kopy.io/mQKNF
[11:29:12] <taplar> alright, so what is your goal?
[11:30:06] <_TWG_> Okay.  I'm needing to list out all of my "points" into as individual li items based on the category they belong to.
[11:30:53] <taplar> i see some of these do not have categories.  what about those?
[11:30:53] <_TWG_> So would I need to do an indexOf first and then loop through it and put those items in the correct ul?  taplar
[11:31:24] <_TWG_> they will all have categories.  I just missed those when I was adding them.
[11:31:32] <taplar> ok, that's fine
[11:31:42] <_TWG_> Every item will belong to at least 1 category.
[11:31:59] <taplar> so there are different approaches you could take with this
[11:32:47] <taplar> personally i'd probably go through each one and build another structure with each category containing a list of all it's points
[11:32:50] <_TWG_> okay.  sorry, jquery isn't what I normally work in.  I'm trying to teach myself as I go.
[11:33:32] <taplar> i'm assuming your wanting to build the items in sequence (item1, then item2, then item3, ...) ?
[11:33:58] <_TWG_> I will eventually end up sorting them by their name which I didn't include.
[11:34:34] <taplar> the name of the item?
[11:35:32] <_TWG_> In the properties there is a name field too but I forgot to include it.
[11:39:04] <taplar> one sec, got some stuff in the office i have to knock out
[11:40:01] <_TWG_> taplar not a problem.  Thanks
[12:03:48] <taplar> _TWG_: take a look at this https://jsfiddle.net/4m6ba0ob/
[12:17:15] <_TWG_> thanks taplar.  working on implementing it now.
[12:17:34] <taplar> cool
[12:22:16] <_TWG_> taplar I'm getting an "m.features is undefined"
[12:23:58] <taplar> update the fiddle and share out what your trying.  i'll brb, getting some food
[12:31:50] <_TWG_> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/L9nopr3h/1/ I know this is a little more than what you asked for.
[12:32:02] <_TWG_> taplar
[12:33:03] <taplar_afk> so which part is erroring?
[12:35:20] <_TWG_> It's the forEach loop you told me to use.
[12:36:20] <taplar_afk> which one?  there are two, :)
[12:37:06] <_TWG_> I put a console.log just after the first one and it's not showing anything in the console so I'm assuming it's that one.
[12:37:13] <taplar_afk> depending on how that geo thing is loading the json, you may be having an issue with the ajax request
[12:37:29] <taplar_afk> your trying to do your logic outside of any of it's callbacks, so that variable may not yet be loaded
[12:38:25] <taplar_afk> console.log(points) right before the forEach and see what you get
[12:40:56] <_TWG_> I get an Obect { urls: Array[1], ajaxParams: Object, _layers: Object, options: Object, _leaflet_events: Object, _initHooksCalled: true }
[12:41:01] <_TWG_> Object
[12:41:27] <taplar_afk> yeah, cause your returning the object returned from the ajax call
[12:41:35] <_TWG_> oh
[12:42:23] <_TWG_> So I'm going to need to rewrite this a little bit taplar_afk
[12:42:43] <taplar_afk> yeah, need to figure out if that method has a success callback option
[12:43:47] <taplar_afk> ah
[12:43:53] <taplar_afk> ok, you can attach a then() to it
[12:44:31] <_TWG_> to which part?
[12:45:22] <taplar_afk> try this https://jsfiddle.net/L9nopr3h/2/
[12:48:20] <_TWG_> TypeError: i(...).then is not a function
[12:49:28] <taplar_afk> hmm
[12:49:41] <taplar_afk> idk then, :(
[12:50:05] <_TWG_> Okay.  I will do some digging on the git repo for the leaflet.ajax call.  Thanks.
[12:55:49] <_TWG_> Found it.  there was a middleware call that I could invoke and then I did the loop taplar_afk
[12:56:04] <taplar_afk> awesome
[12:56:18] <_TWG_> I wish I had noticed that before.  Thanks for all of the help.
[14:25:35] <_TWG_> Still around taplar ?
[14:26:50] <taplar> yup
[14:28:54] <_TWG_> If I have $('.category a').on('click', function(){}); I need to get the data-target and see if the ul has a .show as a class.  taplar
[14:29:09] <_TWG_> Am I making that more complicated than I need to?
[14:29:21] <taplar> data-target is on the 'a'?
[14:29:31] <_TWG_> yes
[14:29:39] <taplar> and how does it relate to the ul?
[14:31:12] <_TWG_> https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/d335054q/ taplar
[14:31:38] <taplar> ah, that's fine, imo
[14:32:27] <_TWG_> Okay.  I just was trying to KISS.   I have a tendency to overthink things.  :D
[14:32:42] <taplar> nah, pretty straight forward.
[14:33:26] <taplar> or, is there going to be more than one ul inside that li?
[14:33:34] <_TWG_> Okay.  So if I want to use this.___ to get the data-target what would I use?
[14:35:43] <taplar> is there only going to be one ul on the same level as the link?
[14:36:19] <_TWG_> Yes.  Each item is wrapped in a li and will have a single ul under it.
[14:36:39] <taplar> in that case you could do without the data-target and simply do $(this).siblings('ul') to get it
[14:37:45] <_TWG_> oh really?  awesome
[14:57:47] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeee
[14:58:13] <taplar> i was waiting on that
[14:58:32] <robertmaxrees> it was about that time.
[15:04:52] <_TWG_> taplar how can I toggle .css('display', 'block') when an item is clicked?
[15:05:38] <robertmaxrees> what's the other status of it?
[15:06:22] <_TWG_> by default in my css it is display: none
[15:06:56] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[15:08:26] <_TWG_> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:42:07] <ABM_Dan> _TWG_: in general try not to have radio and checkboxes without labels, it's bad UX
[15:42:36] <_TWG_> Oh they have labels.  That was just some quick code.
[15:42:40] <_TWG_> Thanks though.
[15:43:11] <ABM_Dan> cool :) Sorry, pet peeve of mine.
[15:52:45] <Jagst3r15> Ok so I have been banging my head against the wall trying to figure out this HTML5 video issue in Chrome. When I click on the video to pause it or go further in the seek than what has been preloaded, I get: “The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause()"
[15:53:04] <Jagst3r15> The only article someone showed me was: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36803176/how-to-prevent-the-play-request-was-interrupted-by-a-call-to-pause-error but I'm not sure that fixes it
[15:53:35] <Jagst3r15> i have most of my other logic done, and this works in Safari/FireFox, just not Chrome :(
[15:53:41] <_TWG_> ADM_Dan no need to apologize
[15:53:51] <_TWG_> ABM_Dan no need to apologize
[15:55:09] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 "but I'm not sure that fixes it"
[15:55:12] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[15:55:54] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 also: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=593273
[15:56:49] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees I read that Chromium issue, but they haven't even addressed it yet
[15:57:03] <Jagst3r15> it's broken even in Chrome Canary still
[15:59:39] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 right, you found a browser bug.
[16:00:26] <Jagst3r15> and I tried adding this https://jsfiddle.net/pym04w53/ to my JS but I get t.pause is not a function
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:00:42] <robertmaxrees> because video is a jquery object.
[16:00:56] <Jagst3r15> oh
[16:00:56] <robertmaxrees> try video[0].pause()
[16:01:05] <Jagst3r15> you are right
[16:01:16] <robertmaxrees> or video.get(0)
[16:01:36] <Jagst3r15> would .eq work too?
[16:01:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> .eq() returns a jquery object.
[16:01:48] <Jagst3r15> oh I see
[16:02:12] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects don't expose the underlying dom methods and properties.
[16:02:25] <Jagst3r15> oh ok (:
[16:02:42] <Jagst3r15> when I add video.get(0).pause().then....I get Cannot read property 'then' of undefined
[16:03:06] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're targeting the right element?>
[16:03:53] <Jagst3r15> yes: var video = jQuery('.main-video');
[16:04:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pym04w53/1/
[16:04:12] <robertmaxrees> what happens f you do this?
[16:04:14] <robertmaxrees> *if
[16:05:40] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees it returns a 2 in the console
[16:05:54] <robertmaxrees> and what kind of elements are they?
[16:06:19] <Jagst3r15> <video class="main-video">...
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> then i have no idea.
[16:06:30] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to play with it to see what's up.
[16:07:46] <Jagst3r15> hmm but what does it mean by "Cannot read property 'then' of undefined"...does that mean no items were found?
[16:08:05] <robertmaxrees> so you have something like video.get(0).pause().then, right?
[16:08:36] <robertmaxrees> so look at the error message - "Cannot read property 'then' of undefined".  that means .pause() returns undefined.
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> i assume the video fully isn't working right now?
[16:10:02] <Jagst3r15> yes
[16:10:06] <Jagst3r15> it doesn't even show
[16:10:14] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, i got nothin'.
[16:10:46] <Jagst3r15> :(
[16:10:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it and play with it.
[16:11:09] <Jagst3r15> I understand, I have it all locally though
[16:11:17] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:11:35] <Jagst3r15> let me try to make a fiddle
[16:11:35] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the code - you could setup a test case in a fiddle and find a video someewhere to link.
[16:11:37] <robertmaxrees> but it's all good.
[16:11:57] <Jagst3r15> tbh it is just frustrating that Chrome is the one, of all browsers
[16:12:09] <robertmaxrees> chrome's actually pretty broken in a lot of ways.
[16:12:19] <Jagst3r15> safari runs this the best lol
[16:12:31] <robertmaxrees> at one point there were more fixes in jquery core for webkit (when chrome was on webkit) than pretty much all other browsers combined.
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> and that's not terribly surprising.  the webkit guys love making shiny and new stuff.
[16:13:22] <arc_> so how is blink compared to that
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> blink is a fork of webkit.
[16:13:56] <arc_> i didn't know that, but they're still different
[16:14:06] <robertmaxrees> not as different as you'd think.
[16:14:21] <robertmaxrees> and chrome still has plenty of bugs.  they also let a lot of bugs marinate for a long time.
[16:32:05] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees it works in the fiddle :(
[16:32:08] <Jagst3r15> https://jsfiddle.net/a1g70h4L/9/
[16:32:52] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're running your code after plyr loads?
[16:34:10] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees  this is what mine looks like https://jsfiddle.net/25cyb336/
[16:34:48] <robertmaxrees> and your js comes after the js for plyr?
[16:35:20] <Jagst3r15> what do you mean? How it cascades load-wise?
[16:35:44] <robertmaxrees> yes - is the script tag for plyr before the script tag for your JS?
[16:40:35] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees yes
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> dunno man
[17:06:55] <YamakasY> is there a way to empty a cache-identifier ? I think it's more jquery like
[17:07:04] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[17:11:22] <YamakasY> ryanneufeld: when I submit a form and open a new form or that one again, my data is still in the form
[17:11:28] <YamakasY> it's in the cache
[17:11:35] <robertmaxrees> you mean the browser cache for inputs.
[17:11:39] <YamakasY> yeah
[17:11:43] <YamakasY> is that different ?
[17:11:44] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete btw :)
[17:11:49] <YamakasY> I thought iot was in the CI
[17:11:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:12:01] <YamakasY> *it
[17:12:08] <robertmaxrees> "in the CI"?
[17:12:17] <YamakasY> Cache-Identifier
[17:12:25] <robertmaxrees> where did you pick that phrase up?
[17:12:38] <YamakasY> cache-identifier is browsercache
[17:12:54] <YamakasY> where you store that part under
[17:13:05] <YamakasY> or where you are working with
[17:13:08] <robertmaxrees> i've never heard of cache-identifier.
[17:13:21] <YamakasY> not ?
[17:13:24] <YamakasY> mhh strange
[17:13:25] <YamakasY> google it
[17:13:28] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[17:13:33] <robertmaxrees> not finding anything that directyl references it.
[17:13:37] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're conflating input caching with http caching.
[17:14:36] <robertmaxrees> the cache that's involved when fetching a page is distinct from the cache that stores input information.
[17:15:02] <YamakasY> ok, but can I empty that input information, it's annoying me
[17:15:26] <YamakasY> it's dark here
[17:15:38] <YamakasY> 23:15 -!- daslicht [~daslicht@dynadsl-080-228-202-060.ewetel.net] has quit []
[17:15:39] <robertmaxrees> the cached/autofilled information?  sure.  http://stackoverflow.com/a/2699400
[17:16:39] <YamakasY> ryanneufeld: yeah found that but it's not doable after I submitted my form ? it's kinda a lot of work to inplement that
[17:16:46] <robertmaxrees> wrong autocomplete btw.
[17:17:02] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to clear the inputs after submitting a form?
[17:30:08] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> and the page has reloaded?  oor...?  because the stack overflow link i sent has everything you need.
[17:38:23] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok, will check that further then, found that post before
[17:38:45] <YamakasY> page has nom reload, only some jquery reload thingy
[17:38:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure what that means.
[17:39:27] <YamakasY> javascript reload then, not my whole part reloads only where javascvript kicks in with html output
[17:39:36] <YamakasY> *page
[17:39:41] <robertmaxrees> so you're doing ajax.
[17:39:41] <YamakasY> s/part/page
[17:39:41] <b-ot> Correction, <YamakasY> javascript reload then, not my whole page reloads only where javascvript kicks in with html output
[17:39:51] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah! it confuses me all the time
[17:40:05] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that confusing.
[17:40:07] <YamakasY> lol that bot is kewl
[17:40:27] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: no I was reading about it in the past, when you helped me 4 months ago :D
[17:40:34] <YamakasY> but I have braindamage
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[17:40:53] <YamakasY> short term to long term mem issue
[17:40:58] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:41:03] <YamakasY> I can live with it :)
[17:41:16] <YamakasY> I never give up, that is how I fix that part ;)
[17:42:03] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: so your help in the past made my view wider, or actually... nothing is stupid if yuou keep improving it :)
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:42:19] <YamakasY> sao trhanks :D
[17:42:21] <YamakasY> *so
[17:42:44] <YamakasY> I have a shitty keyboard and my head is starting to bang... I can do 2 things then. get sleep or go twice as fast as normal in that case
[17:42:58] <YamakasY> if you learn how to train your brain... wow you can do magic with it
[17:43:38] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: never forget that when you get older, you can use other parts of your brain
[17:44:20] <YamakasY> you just need to allocate them and that takes or a hard crash, so instantly or years, but try it, I think most IT people actually do
[17:44:58] <robertmaxrees> OK.
[17:45:50] <arc_> o_o
[17:46:06] <YamakasY> kinda kewl, really it makes you feel you can fly... which I don't recommend
[17:46:21] <robertmaxrees> heh i'm totally lost, but okay :)
[17:46:38] <robertmaxrees> what's everybody working on today?
[17:46:40] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: trigger your unused brainparts then :D
[17:46:47] <YamakasY> so you can catch up :P
[17:46:49] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i'm really not sure what that means, but ok.
[17:47:15] * YamakasY thinks robertmaxrees is still in 512MB memory and never extended that :D
[17:48:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure if you're trying to insult me now, but maybe we can get back to something roughly on topic ;)
[17:50:08] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: sarcasm is never insulting, you seem to have some focus on that word ;)
[17:50:47] <robertmaxrees> without other cues it's hard to pick up on whether somebody is being sarcastic or not.
[17:53:30] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: it's too easy to get yourself into a victimrole, but anyways, we won't go there :) other things todo
[17:53:41] <robertmaxrees> uh, okay?
[19:24:21] <Azrael_-> hi
[19:24:44] <Azrael_-> is there a nice way to check if jquery is present and load it, if it isn't?
[19:38:34] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- just saw this.
[19:38:50] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- there aren't any nice ways, no.
[19:39:01] <robertmaxrees> Generally, you should guarantee that JQ is loaded already.
[19:45:28] <Azrael_-> robertmaxrees: found this one and it sounds at least not that bad: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/load-jquery-only-if-not-present/
[19:45:54] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to do that in the first place is my point.
[19:45:57] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?
[19:50:22] <Azrael_-> robertmaxrees: i want to provide an include-code-snippet for potentially multiple sites to load a video player. as i don't have any control about the environment my snippet is embedded i thought about loading jquery if it isn't present and using some of its functions
[19:51:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea
[19:51:08] <robertmaxrees> you should tell them jquery is a requirement.
[19:51:57] <Azrael_-> also an option ...
[19:52:53] <Azrael_-> i already have to load an external library as basis for the player. i'm currently using this script here (no dependency to jquery yet): http://www.sitepoint.com/dynamically-load-jquery-library-javascript/
[19:53:10] <Azrael_-> just modified this example for my lib
[19:53:20] <robertmaxrees> but you can't guarantee the version the site has loaded.
[19:53:34] <Azrael_-> correct, that's my main concern. same regarding the plugins
[19:53:49] <robertmaxrees> which is why you require speciic versions.
[19:53:52] <robertmaxrees> like.
[19:53:56] <robertmaxrees> tell the developer to.
[19:54:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of loading it yourself.
[19:54:16] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you run the risk of, say, stomping all over their copy of jquery.
[19:54:39] <Azrael_-> seems like you can avoid some of these things using noconflict
[19:55:23] <robertmaxrees> that's still not a guarantee.
[19:55:33] <robertmaxrees> you're also now adding extra libraries/requests to their page.
[19:55:35] <Azrael_-> ok, good to know
[19:55:43] <robertmaxrees> just require a particular version of jquery and call it a day.
[19:55:48] <robertmaxrees> that's a really common thing to do.
[19:55:56] <Azrael_-> thanks for the hints, will follow them
[20:04:50] <Azrael_-> for load balancing for my video player i have to generate the playlist of the player using some backend methods. should i server the player code with a static file and retrieve the playlist using an ajax-call or should i generate the player code (the js-file) using the dynamic backend (php)?
[22:44:14] <drei> hi all
[22:45:40] <drei> how do you hide a div by clicking anywhere else except 'it' on the screen, see fiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/2euj9nnz/3/
[22:45:51] <drei> any help much appreciated
[22:57:07] <Jonno_FTW> anyone familiar with parseHTML function? I get different results when using the console and when using the dom
[22:57:52] <Jonno_FTW> drei: use $(window).click(function(){...})
[22:58:06] <Jonno_FTW> put some if statements in the function
[22:58:38] <drei> what about this Jonn_FTW - https://jsfiddle.net/2euj9nnz/14/
[22:58:53] <drei> *Jonno_FTW
[22:59:01] <Jonno_FTW> press tab to complete names
[22:59:17] <drei> Jonno_FTW:
[22:59:23] <drei> thanks
[23:00:11] <Jonno_FTW> so you want a div to disappear if you click anywhere but the button?
[23:00:29] <Jonno_FTW> looks like you got it
[23:00:38] <drei> it ain't working
[23:01:48] <drei> ah sorry it does work but I don't want it to close when you click on the input Jonno_FTW
[23:02:06] <drei> Jonno_FTW: it does work but I don't want it to close when you click on the input
[23:03:01] <drei> Jonno_FTW: everything else but the thing that is getting toggled
[23:03:24] <Jonno_FTW> just prevent default when you click ont he input?
[23:03:35] <drei> how?
[23:03:50] <drei> what you mean by prevent default?
[23:04:04] <Jonno_FTW> call e.preventDefault();
[23:04:35] <drei> instead of calling stopPropagation?
[23:05:28] <Jonno_FTW> idk
[23:05:35] <Jonno_FTW> idk if this is a good UX anyway
[23:05:51] <drei> idk?
[23:05:55] <Jonno_FTW> I don't know
[23:06:02] <drei> ah sorry ok
[23:06:23] <drei> how else could it be done?
[23:10:18] <drei> any other ideas Jonno_FTW ?
[23:10:20] <Jonno_FTW> no idea
[23:10:26] <drei> ok thanks
