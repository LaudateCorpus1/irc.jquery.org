[06:03:21] <dimi1947> are you aware of any good date plugin where I can select a date range?
[07:40:04] <ne2k> I create an button $btn = $('<button>') then set osme data $btn.data('key', 'val); then append to element $group.append($btn); then later, $group.childen('button').each((i, el) => { $(el).data() }) is empty; what am I doing wrong?
[07:41:01] <ne2k> ah. I lied. I did $group.clone().children(...); without, it works
[07:48:04] <Cork> ne2k: .clone() has an option to clone the data too
[07:48:14] <Cork> but ya, by default it doesn't keep the data reference
[07:50:07] <ne2k> Cork, thanks
[07:53:54] <MTecknology> I'm currently working on a project to make debian a bit more fun. The thing that scares me most about the project is the web front-end. It requires a context-sensitive (based on drop down list) of optional panels that can be rearranged with the arrangement and contents auto-saved. I can provide a crap ton more if anyone is interested in helping make debian a better distro.  ... sorry if
[07:54:00] <MTecknology> this is crazy OT, but what's needed is mostly jquery stuff and I don't know who to ask for help with this. I'm trying, but I'm struggling.
[09:02:14] <grid-> hey
[09:02:23] <grid-> does anyone know a jquery way for this block of code? does anyone know a jquery way for this block of code? for (i = 0; i < data.columns["length"]; i++) {
[09:05:34] <grid-> sorry i did repeat myself
[09:10:17] <pavonia> Depending on what you do inside the loop $.each might be appropriate
[09:14:55] <grid-> pavonia: https://jsbin.com/giqijaquta/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:14:59] <grid-> this is the function
[09:18:11] <pavonia> Is data.columns an array or an object? You seem to be mixing accessors of both
[09:21:28] <grid-> i believe it's an object because console.log(Array.isArray(data.columns["length"])); returns false
[09:22:37] <pavonia> But that's a different one, I'm talking about data.column only
[09:23:50] <grid-> console.log(Array.isArray(data.columns)); returns true
[09:28:09] <pavonia> Ah right, length is not a function :S
[09:28:36] <pavonia> You can use $.each(data.columns, ...) then
[09:29:08] <grid-> yeah i found that but there are no function argements to use?
[09:29:21] <grid-> $.each( obj, function( key, value ) {
[09:31:18] <pavonia> The function looks like (index, value) => { ... }
[09:35:08] <grid-> $.each( data.columns, function( index, i ) => { ?
[09:35:11] <grid-> this didn't work
[09:35:45] <grid-> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '=>'
[09:36:10] <grid-> $.each( data.columns, function( index, i ) { either
[09:39:19] <grid-> https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/iterating/
[09:42:34] <grid-> $.each( data.columns, function( index, i ){ getting missing ) after argement list but $.each( data.columns, function( index, i )) also doesn't work
[09:43:46] <pavonia> $.each(data.columns, (i, val) => { ... loop code here ... }) where i is the index and val the value at index i
[09:44:50] <pavonia> The function is a parameter of .each, either you define it inline or you give it a name and use the name there
[09:47:23] <grid-> yes, i noticed about the ending }) with using jslint, now will try your code
[09:51:44] <grid-> $.each(data.columns, (i, length) => { will not work, probably it will loop all the elements on the same position somehow
[09:55:42] <pavonia> length is wrong there (or at least seriously misnamed)
[09:55:51] <grid-> same with  $.each(data.columns, (i, val) => {
[09:56:10] <pavonia> Then show your full code
[09:56:22] <Uhkis> you might get an answer if you'd provide an actual usecase
[09:56:42] <grid-> https://jsbin.com/bapawixene/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:57:10] <grid-> https://jsbin.com/binutegucu/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:58:22] <Uhkis> yes, that would be a good example of a poor one
[09:59:08] <grid-> Uhkis: yes i can try to share usecase
[09:59:20] <pavonia> Beside the wrong brace this looks correctly translated
[10:08:43] <grid-> https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/56943 this thread is exactly what happens, found the other method here: https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/56943
[10:09:12] <grid-> i tried to setup a fiddle with a total usecase but i'm not sure (yet) why it currently only works local
[10:11:56] <grid-> oops
[10:12:27] <grid-> https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/comment/153844/#Comment_153844 should be the first url
[12:49:15] <crs> Hi there, anyone keen to help me figure out why one snippet works and another doesnt? :)
[12:49:57] <robertmaxrees> crs yep - just share the code in some fiddles and we can help! :)
[12:53:53] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[12:55:03] <crs> robertmaxrees: Perfect, thanks! I am not sure if I can manage to get fiddles in, let me just paste code to start with. !s
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> sure - just don't paste the code straight into the channel ;)
[12:58:38] <crs> robertmaxrees: Haha, of course. :)
[13:00:12] <robertmaxrees> plan on sharing out the two snippets??
[13:00:42] <crs> robertmaxrees: So my problem is that I have number of forms for which I want to have selectize enabled widgets to retrieve options from API endpoints. I haver created a script for each form and it worked. Obviously code repetition was very aparent and I very much disliked having ~10 scripts with almost the same content just different var names. So I am trying to create like a parametrised script
[13:00:48] <crs> which I can call from HTML just passing different data- attrs.
[13:01:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:01:12] <crs> So this is original script that works: https://dpaste.org/GTyk and this is reworked one that doesnt: https://dpaste.org/fgKz
[13:01:36] <robertmaxrees> so what about it "doesn't work"?
[13:01:40] <crs> But what's weird is what I mean by 'doesn't work'.
[13:01:50] <crs> Ha! Exactlty! Glad you asked. :)
[13:02:27] <crs> So, 'new' script calls API, gets data back, https://dpaste.org/fgKz#L55,56 will print some retrieved objects.
[13:03:06] <crs> But selectize does not pop dropdown menu as I type, but when I use backspace to remove search string it shows options after I delete last character.
[13:03:56] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is that selectize isn't showing options as you type, but does show after you delete everything in the search box?
[13:04:17] <crs> Correct, sorry if my english made it difficult to understand.
[13:04:35] <robertmaxrees> just a lotta words for a one-line problem :)
[13:05:39] <robertmaxrees> so for the obvious issues: your original has callback(res.results.slice(0, 10)); in the ajax success, but the new one has callback(res.slice(0, 10));
[13:06:29] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm i see the var assignment.
[13:06:52] <robertmaxrees> although you shouldn't do that the way you are - don't mutate objects like that.
[13:07:31] <robertmaxrees> also: you aren't replicating #selectize-search-script on the page, right?
[13:07:46] <robertmaxrees> do console.log($('[id=selectize-search-script]').length); to be sure.
[13:08:11] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i have no real way to help without seeing this in context.
[13:09:24] <crs> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/LXCF86Q.gif
[13:09:37] <robertmaxrees> pictures/gifs are no help, sadly.
[13:09:40] <robertmaxrees> even with logging output.
[13:09:50] <robertmaxrees> i need to be able to interact with the code in action.
[13:10:24] <crs> I know, I knwo, just thought I will show what I mean. :)
[13:10:36] <robertmaxrees> heh, unhelpful either way ;)
[13:11:02] <crs> $('[id=selectize-search-script]').length returns 1
[13:11:24] <robertmaxrees> okay, then yeah.  without being able to interact with this, i've got nothing :/
[13:12:38] <robertmaxrees> oh and kill that use strict ;)
[13:14:03] <crs> Why? :)
[13:14:28] <robertmaxrees> causes more headaches than its work.  use linting tools and whatnot during dev instead.
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> *than it's worth
[13:15:06] <crs> Ah, ok, cool. Will do. Thanks for hint.
[13:15:34] <robertmaxrees> also relevant to note that it's not even a subset of js - it's got intentionally different semantics.
[13:17:24] <crs> robertmaxrees: Can't figure out how to create codepen for that, it has that api call to my laptop. :(
[13:17:41] <robertmaxrees> if you use jsfiddle instead, you can simualte ajax calls.
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> *simulate
[13:18:00] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, abstract out the ajax calls and just use mock data instead.
[13:19:06] <crs> Getting complicated. ;/
[13:19:42] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:20:11] <crs> robertmaxrees: I barely know JS. :)
[13:20:35] <robertmaxrees> then it's a great opportunity to learn.
[13:20:57] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/MP5Q
[13:21:00] <robertmaxrees> line 18
[13:23:06] <robertmaxrees> get the idea?
[13:23:27] <crs> Yeah, sure, thanks. Just need to get correct data structure
[13:24:28] <crs> Hmm, how to add selectize to jsfiddle?
[13:24:31] <robertmaxrees> that's easy :) add console.log(JSON.stringify(res.results)); to the working one and copy from your console.
[13:24:47] <crs> ah, got it
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/EG7PDGN.png for adding libs/frameworks
[13:25:14] <crs> Thanks for that stringify!!! :)
[13:29:42] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:33:37] <crs> robertmaxrees: Doesnt work at all there https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/1/
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> check out your console.  missing deps
[13:35:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xaczb834/2/
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> needed the standalone version of the js.
[13:36:07] <robertmaxrees> and figured it out.
[13:36:15] <crs> Ah, that microplugin
[13:36:32] <robertmaxrees> var searchField = 'country'; - check out the objects in the array coming back from your server.
[13:37:10] <robertmaxrees> there's no "country" property./
[13:37:24] <crs> ah, name…
[13:37:53] <crs> Ah my god! :)
[13:38:02] <crs> robertmaxrees: You are the best! :)
[13:38:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:38:43] <crs> I did change the endpoint a bit… but was so surprised that it was adding those options when I deleted input…
[13:38:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:39:12] <robertmaxrees> so long story short - this is why test cases are helpful.
[13:39:48] <crs> robertmaxrees: Would you mind one more question? :)
[13:40:06] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask.  if you have a question, pop it into the channel.  if somebody can help, they wil..
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:40:30] <crs> So side question actually, how did you figure out that misnamed property?
[13:40:36] <crs> It was so silently failing for me…
[13:40:54] <robertmaxrees> it was silently failing for me as well.
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> but i started from the beginning.
[13:41:33] <robertmaxrees> and removed all assumptions.  checked to see if there were any discrepancies in the config.
[13:42:00] <robertmaxrees> if i were you, i would've triple checked that my server-side changes were reflected on my client.
[13:43:12] <crs> I guess I just dont understand how selectize really works…
[13:43:20] <robertmaxrees> neither do it.
[13:43:22] <robertmaxrees> *do I
[13:44:14] <robertmaxrees> but it seemed odd that the search field or w/e it's called didn't actually exist in that array.
[13:44:56] <robertmaxrees> did you not write this code originally?
[13:50:05] <crs> OK, one more thing then if you dont mind. I want to initialise that widget with an item (like, preselect it on load) if there is ?pk=<id> in URL. I have came up with that: https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/4/ - this is contained in onInitialize(). It was for another form, so there is more stuff there, but the problem is that I am getting thos undefined values everywhere. ;/
[13:50:20] <crs> Yeah, I did write it, but didn't remember much, it was a while back.
[13:50:31] <robertmaxrees> "i'm getting thos undefined values everywhere" huh?
[13:51:27] <crs> Sorry
[13:52:48] <crs> So line 41 here https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/5/ would display correct strings, that came from ajax call, it works, but what I would see in actual widget on the page would be undefined / undefined / undefined / undefined undefined.
[13:53:24] <robertmaxrees> then mock it up again.
[13:53:48] <robertmaxrees> same way you did before, just in that onInitialize this time.
[13:54:58] <crs> Hmm, 1s, need to make sure I copied and change everything correctly.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[13:56:20] <crs> robertmaxrees: Trust me, I am very much in dark here. :)
[13:56:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm laughing because you apparently didn't make sure you copied it correctly before ;)
[14:00:33] <crs> robertmaxrees: Well, I presented simpleer form, and that onInitialize is from some more build up one. :)
[14:01:19] <crs> Anyways, I got that: https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/7/ - how would I call it with ?pk=14?
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L74o12qy/
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> just do var pk = '14'; and call it a day.
[14:03:11] <crs> Ah… ;)
[14:03:17] * crs ashamed
[14:04:13] <crs> Ah, need to mock that response up again…
[14:09:10] <crs> robertmaxrees: I think that should be ok… https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/15/
[14:09:21] <robertmaxrees> what is selectized ?
[14:09:29] <robertmaxrees> it's not defined so...
[14:10:08] <crs> line 7, no?
[14:10:12] <robertmaxrees> also: data.country isn't defined.
[14:11:36] <crs> Ah, in console.log? fixed.
[14:11:45] <robertmaxrees> new fiddle?
[14:12:41] <robertmaxrees> and on line 7 - the var doesn't exist until after the whole statement is over.  e.g. selectized isn't defined until after the whole thing is done initializing.
[14:13:40] <crs> Hmm, Odd, because those onDropdownClose() and onBlur() (when uncommented) work fine…
[14:13:59] <robertmaxrees> just going by what the console tells me.
[14:14:08] <crs> I know, it tells me the same
[14:14:37] <robertmaxrees> also: those two methods you named don't execuse until after the whole thing has initialized.
[14:14:44] <robertmaxrees> so the var is defined by then.
[14:15:12] <crs> https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/18/ - yeah, it works like that
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> though you should change those to be like onDropdownClose: function($dropdown) {
[14:15:23] <crs> That makes sense!
[14:15:25] <robertmaxrees> and then refer to the dropdown that way.
[14:16:07] <crs> Ah, nice, thank you!
[14:17:50] <crs> ReferenceError: Can't find variable: dropdown
[14:18:16] <robertmaxrees> show me your code
[14:19:46] <robertmaxrees> also: it looks like you're just calling addOption incorrectly.
[14:20:31] <crs> https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/19/
[14:20:56] <robertmaxrees> ???
[14:21:15] <robertmaxrees> so confused right now.
[14:21:16] <crs> robertmaxrees: Yeah, wasnt sure how to initialize it, that's what I am asking for help with now. Docs are not very verbose and I can't make too much out of them. :(
[14:21:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6hkj5u2c/5/
[14:21:33] <robertmaxrees> you want something like this.
[14:21:48] <robertmaxrees> not in the onInitialize.
[14:21:56] <crs> robertmaxrees: Ah, sorry, last link has that $dropdown you suggested, so when you type in 'au' then click outside od widget to close dropdown you will get an error
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't have that change in it >.>
[14:22:28] <crs> no? sent wrong link?
[14:22:31] <crs> hmm, 1 s
[14:22:39] <robertmaxrees> either way, look at my most recent one.
[14:23:04] <crs> https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/21/
[14:23:09] <crs> Yes, I am now, testing, 1s
[14:23:22] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> $dropdown and dropdown are not the same :) need to do console.log($dropdown) instead.
[14:23:46] <robertmaxrees> either way, gotta go.  be back in a while.
[14:25:37] <crs> robertmaxrees: Cool, thanks! On one you pasted here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6hkj5u2c/5/ - you are getting exactly the same problem I was facing - undefined instead of 'Australia' ;)
[14:25:57] <crs> robertmaxrees: Ping me if you would like to come back to it later. I would appreciate it.
[14:37:18] <mikejw> I'm trying to use sortable from jquery-ui and getting the error: "js.js:1560 Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: data"
[14:37:46] <mikejw> trying to use the latest stable version of jquery and jquer-ui
[14:38:05] <mikejw> I saw somewhere that this might be related to not including the appropriate jquery-ui CSS
[14:39:31] <mikejw> anyone have any ideas?
[14:41:35] <mikejw> ok I think I'm not compiling enough of jquery-ui
[14:42:45] <mikejw> needed data and scroll-parent
[14:42:47] <mikejw> sorted!
[15:20:17] <robertmaxrees> back.
[15:22:07] <robertmaxrees> crs if you have questions, just ask the channel.
[15:22:12] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[15:38:42] <crs> robertmaxrees: Ah, had problem with branches, had to rebase my branch to get some new stuff in and things went downhill. :)
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> k
[15:49:43] <crs> I think I have it under control now. :)
[15:50:12] <crs> So, back to that $dropdown, it does not work with $dropdown nor dropdown (without $).
[15:50:17] <robertmaxrees> show me
[15:51:30] <crs> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/t78kQVGDvX/p3tzvq9a/22/
[15:52:35] <crs> robertmaxrees: try to search for 'au', then click outside of dropdown to close it
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> sorry - onBlur doesn't support that.
[15:54:07] <robertmaxrees> onDropdownClose does.
[15:55:34] <crs> Stil getting it for onDropDown…
[15:55:42] <crs> onDropdownClose that is :)
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> weird.  docs seem to say otherwise.
[15:58:31] <robertmaxrees> wonder where the discrepancy is.
[15:58:43] <crs> Is that where you are looking at: https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/usage.md ?
[15:58:46] <robertmaxrees> $dropdown is a thing.  might be the wrong element.
[15:58:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:59:37] <crs> so $dropdown is: Ah, sorry, $dropdown exists
[15:59:48] <crs> just those methods to clear it don't.
[15:59:59] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno.
[16:01:34] <crs> robertmaxrees: perhaps its only limited to those: https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#methods_dropdown ?
[16:02:37] <crs> reverted it back to selectized[0].selectize.clearOptions(); - it works jsut fine. :)
[16:03:12] <crs> robertmaxrees: So two remaining things are: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6hkj5u2c/5/ 1) why undefined? 2) how to close that dropdown?
[16:04:03] <robertmaxrees> because you're only supplying label and not name.
[16:04:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6hkj5u2c/6/
[16:05:24] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "how to close that dropdown?"  under what conditions??
[16:06:46] <crs> when it gets initialised with value, on example you just posted dropdown is open, I would like it to be closed and that item with pk provided be selected.
[16:12:09] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/issues/284 :)
[16:12:12] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend.
[16:19:50] <crs> robertmaxrees: hmm, why not just close() I dont understand it…
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: welcome to outdated, unmaintained libraries.
[16:21:05] <crs> yeah… ;(
[16:21:30] <crs> Do you know what's better to use?
[16:21:36] <robertmaxrees> anything that's more recent.
[16:21:48] <robertmaxrees> or just build my own, depending.
[16:23:55] <crs> Ah, if select2 only could display search inline, like selectize… :(
[16:24:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:24:38] <robertmaxrees> it can...
[16:24:42] <robertmaxrees> https://select2.org/searching
[16:27:26] <crs> robertmaxrees: https://select2.org/dropdown - when you click on that widget instead of just being able to start typing like in selectize it puts you into another input in dropdown, on mobile that secondary input does not get focused automatically. ;/
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[16:29:29] <crs> robertmaxrees: wont torture you any more, thank you so much for all your help today!
[16:29:35] <robertmaxrees> sure
[17:07:36] <crs> robertmaxrees: only way to hide that dropdown after selecting item on initialisation I found is to do .disable(). :(
[17:07:55] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[17:08:27] <crs> But it's awful. ;/
[17:09:06] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[19:39:05] <SaraDR> For mobile/browser, what's a good approach to run a function when an input field change value? I thought of plain html using the onkeyup or something, but does that even trigger on mobile?
[19:39:31] <SaraDR> Usecase, I have an icon which changes between yes/no if the input is valid.
