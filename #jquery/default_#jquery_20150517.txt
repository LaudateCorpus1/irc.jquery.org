[00:26:23] <MarkProffitt> When you drop items on the ".between"  UL that UL should change to ".droptrue" and create two new ".between" UL around itself. PROBLEM: It looks like a ".droptrue" but acts like a ".between" and the new ".beween" don't act properly.

[02:30:02] <MarkProffitt> hello?
[02:31:45] <MeiR`> MarkProffitt, i don't think you understand the handling of sortable widget
[02:50:47] <MarkProffitt> MeiR' what do you mean?
[02:54:58] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` I don't care about the order of the items inside each UL. I'm trying to sort the groups and put LI in the proper groups
[02:56:04] <MeiR`> MarkProffitt, why you create those empty "ul"s?
[02:56:29] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` so I can drop the LI in them
[02:57:56] <MeiR`> MarkProffitt, please define what you're trying to do from scratch
[02:58:20] <MeiR`> you wanna have three lists and abillity to drag items between them?
[02:58:44] <MarkProffitt> I want infinite lists
[03:00:35] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` I want the user to be able to sort all the LI as "same", "more", or "less" and create new lists for "same" as they sort.
[03:04:07] <MeiR`> MarkProffitt, you mean that every new "same" will have its own "more" and "less"?
[03:04:17] <MarkProffitt> Yes
[03:04:29] <MarkProffitt> potential "more" or "less"
[03:05:11] <MarkProffitt> I'm trying to allow people to sort but have "same"
[03:06:31] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` sortable is almost perfect as it is, I just need to allow "same"
[03:22:39] * widoz is away: auto-away
[03:38:07] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` any ideas?
[03:44:01] <MarkProffitt> http://jsfiddle.net/jw7zer9n/  I'm trying to sort with groups "same" not just more & less. FUNCTION: Drop items on the ".between" UL that UL should change to ".droptrue" and create a new ".between" UL above and bellow itself. PROBLEM: It looks like a ".droptrue" but acts like a ".between" and the new ".between" don't do anything.
[03:47:24] <MeiR`> MarkProffitt, sorry, i had a phone
[03:47:43] <MeiR`> your approach is too complicated for me to implement
[03:48:39] <MarkProffitt> MeiR`, if sortable would just allow "same" it would be what I need.
[03:49:18] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` a way to connect to a LI and not just a UL.
[03:50:09] <MeiR`> MarkProffitt, but the logic of "connectWith" is to connect two lists
[03:50:24] <MeiR`> (two or more)
[03:50:32] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` I have this working perfectly in pure Javascript but I need touch screen
[03:51:43] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` OK, connecting 2 or more lists is what I want. I need to create new lists as needed.
[03:53:09] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` the JSFiddle almost works but for some reason the "between" doesn't fully become a "droptrue" It gets the look but not the functionality
[03:54:17] <MarkProffitt> MeiR` I suspect there is some problem with the binding but I don't understand that at all
[04:02:14] <Hamled> I'm trying to create a form that is submitted via ajax. I'm using $(form).ajaxSubmit(), but even when the server returns a status code of 200/201 the error handler function is being called
[04:03:05] <Hamled> I was looking around for information about that, when I saw someone mention that I should be using the Deferred style for setting the callbacks, so I switched from passing error/success options to ajaxSubmit and used fail() and done() on the XHR object
[04:03:41] <Hamled> but after making that change (and no other functional changes), when I submit the form my browser reload the page with the JSON response, as though it were not an AJAX request anymore
[04:04:20] <Hamled> is there something I need to pass to ajaxSubmit when using done/fail/always to ensure that it will actually do an ajax query? The server's response is not any sort of redirection code
[04:57:00] <Uhkis> Hamled: use on.submit(function(e){e.preventDefault(); ... })
[05:04:42] <Hamled> Uhkis, not sure where I have access to the event object, my ajaxSubmit call is part of a function being passed to the jquery validate plugin's configuration, and that function only receives the form element
[05:05:35] <Hamled> thanks though I'll look more along those lines
[05:08:02] <Uhkis> Hamled: showing some code would help
[05:10:20] <opiumniy> What projects are ypu workong on?
[05:12:35] <Hamled> Uhkis, here you go http://hastebin.com/ireyizogok.js
[05:14:05] <opiumniy> Are u creating social web?
[05:15:17] * widoz is away: auto-away
[05:15:21] <Hamled> Uhkis, some SO answers I found just said to do the submission using the normal jQuery submit() stuff and use preventDefault as you mentioned, seems like the easiest fix
[05:18:22] * widoz is back (gone 00:03:06)
[05:33:52] <opiumniy> Are there anybody? It is too silent thr
[05:38:57] <Hamled> Uhkis, oh okay it turns out that that the jQuery Form plugin (which actually provides ajaxSubmit) doesn't return the XHR object from ajaxSubmit, so the chained done() and fail() calls were doing nothing

[06:27:12] <Sarco> Good day, I have here a piece of jquery trying to hide and show some elements but is seems it is not executed: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/K8ceT3kGVpw5oBphVgDe/ I tried adding a console log but nothing appears in the console in the browser. I want the content to be invisible and appear when I click the link for that specific content. Please advice
[06:28:00] <Sarco> I have the jquery in a seperate file and the rest of the code works
[06:31:12] <MeiR`> Sarco, you can call hideall() when the document is ready
[06:31:49] <MeiR`> or, alternatively, to put disaply:none in the css of 3d_icon,laser_icon,tools_icon
[06:35:07] <MeiR`> [16:06:46] <pikaren> what should be used in place of .error() since error was deprecated
[06:35:18] <MeiR`> what do you need it for?

[08:25:00] <Cupertino> nbt: I tried manipulating that form_data variable to a add property_id field. Property Ids are in the drop downlist that I would want to send along with the image uploaded
[08:27:47] <nbt> Cupertino: yes, you need to append a new key/value to the form_data
[08:28:04] <nbt> form_data.append('property_id', ...);
[08:28:34] <nbt> obviously you need to get the id from the drop down list

[11:27:39] <DeltaHeavy> ngharo: But how do I pass it 'event' as a parameter for when it's called?
[11:31:20] <ngharo> the code that fires 'click' calls the handler with the event parameter already

[11:34:46] <uskerine> hi
[11:35:43] <uskerine> can I do this:  $('#tab1 area[data-key="'+user+'"]').mapster('select');    (where room is a string, I am trying to do things like this one:  $('#tab1 area[data-key="109"]').mapster('select');   )
[11:36:16] <uskerine> so instead of a constant, can I refer an object having part of its selector in a variable?
[11:38:11] <nbt> uskerine: yes, because the selector is a string

[22:36:49] <sentiment> what is wrong ?
[22:46:40] <uskerine> sentiment, I never used jqgrid, but just in case it helps: double check with firebug or equivalent in chrome that the POST is actually sending data, also as per jqgrid documentation maybe you should try something like: $("#grid_id").jqGrid('setGridParam',{...})
[22:47:40] <uskerine> in datatables (similar plugin) you do             var oMyGrid = $('#datagrid'). .......... and then apply methods to oMyGrid
[22:48:06] <uskerine> so you might want to try to assign a variable during first definition and then do things like oMyGrid.setGridParam(.....    or oMyGrid.trigger(....
