[00:00:26] <joeo> @vinex08
[00:00:54] <joeo> i don't think you closed the code correctly. I think you are missing a closing bracket and paren.
[00:02:34] <km4> Uhkis: ok ;)
[00:04:02] <DanielDC> hello guys, im putting e.stop inside input form and then do some validation, i wonder how do i fire it after the validation is over
[00:04:35] <Cork> there is no event.stop()
[00:10:59] <km4> "26-08-2015","26-08-2015","26-08-2015","25-08-2015","25-08-2015","25-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015","24-08-2015",, how can I sort this ? Need only one date with the same day
[00:22:25] <tty> hola! i want to use http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/ without the anchor tag. is it possible? to just use the lightbox using only the <img> ?
[00:23:37] <nodist> with some scripts probably
[00:24:32] <nodist> but why would you not want to use the a tag?
[00:25:58] <nodist> tty?
[00:31:46] <tty> nodist: i want to skip the <a href..> part because i want to avoid calls o the server.
[00:32:25] <nodist> lightbox stops the default action of the a tag when used
[00:33:57] <tty> nodist: what do u mean?
[00:34:08] <tty> but can i skip the <a href> part?
[00:35:37] <nodist> srry thinking of something else, so you just want it to popup an image that is all ready loaded on the page?
[00:35:49] <tty> nodist: exaclty :)
[00:37:50] <nodist> gonna try a fiddle
[00:38:55] <nodist> lightbox might not be the best option, give me a sec with colorbox
[00:44:35] <tty> nodist: hm. ok thanks :)
[00:45:23] <tty> nodist: i also tried this but didnt work http://stackoverflow.com/a/13069222
[00:45:29] <Utils> Which is preferred: Using .append within a loop, or concatenating onto an existing string and doing .html ?
[00:46:06] <Uhkis> Utils: .pushing to an array ;)
[00:46:26] <nodist> tty I just tried this and it looks like its doing what you want http://jsfiddle.net/vkneq2tx/
[00:46:32] <Utils> hmm? and how would I get that array into the dom Uhkis ?
[00:46:53] <Uhkis> Utils: $(element).append(array.join());
[00:47:34] <Utils> Uhkis: oo, why is that preferred over concatenation?
[00:47:36] <tty> nodist: looks good. let me try tis
[00:47:37] <tty> this*
[00:47:45] <Uhkis> Utils: faster
[00:48:19] <Uhkis> Utils: either way, don't append in a loop, that's  slow
[00:49:33] <keglevich> I have a jquery vertical dropdown (accordion) menu at my wordpress site which would need a small modification... if here's someone who would be willing to check it out, I'd highly appreciate it!
[00:49:46] <Utils> Uhkis: just what I like to hear! The reason why I used .append was because it was in a loop, would you still recommend .append(array.join()) or would .html(array.join()) be preferred? The container is empty to begin with and this is only ran once.
[00:50:10] <Uhkis> html
[00:50:13] <nodist> keglevich I'll take a look
[00:53:58] <vinex08> thanks joeo
[01:36:43] <toomus> Hi all
[01:43:23] <toomus> I integrate emoji emoticons with my app, and I want to make suggestions like Github.
[01:45:41] <toomus> That when you type a colon, little window with suggestions shows up near the current position of cursor.
[01:48:58] <toomus> The main question is, how to place this little window near cursor?
[02:14:13] <toomus> Why I can't get cursor coordinates? http://pastie.org/10378884
[02:15:57] <xhoy> hi is there a way of doing this: https://gist.github.com/xhoy/35d0674f26e90e8606d0
[02:16:27] <xhoy> add an element to a tree somewhere in the middle? i can append and stuff but then i should 'move' the elements inside there?
[02:17:00] <Cork> xhoy: you could use .wrap or add the children to the new element and append it
[02:17:15] <Cork> (the later is basically what wrap does)
[02:17:46] <xhoy> aah ok
[02:18:03] <xhoy> thanks!
[02:18:10] <xhoy> what search query would you use for this?
[02:18:11] <Cork> toomus: there is no mouse event on keyboard events
[02:18:22] <Cork> or rather there is no mouse values on keyboard events
[02:18:25] <toomus> Cork: ahhhhh
[02:19:12] <toomus> Cork: so maybe you have some idea how Github make this popup with emoji suggestions?
[02:19:40] <Cork> xhoy: $('.foo').each(function() { $(this).find('.bar').wrap('<div class="newdiff">); });
[02:20:00] <xhoy> Cork: no i mean google :P
[02:20:12] <Cork> ?api wrapAll
[02:20:12] <b-ot> Cork: .wrapAll(): Wrap an HTML structure around all elements in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapAll/
[02:20:22] <xhoy> Cork: i was seaching for stuff like tree and add element in tree
[02:20:23] <xhoy> etc
[02:20:34] <xhoy> but only got results for .append .find etc etc etc
[02:20:48] <xhoy> so i was wondering how the heck i would find this in google:)
[02:20:48] <Cork> xhoy: look at api.jquery.com it is the best source of functions to use
[02:21:04] <xhoy> yeah but it is impossible to read on all of them :>
[02:21:07] <Cork> i would not recommend using google, too much so junk shows up
[02:21:26] <Cork> xhoy: http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/dom-insertion-around/
[02:21:29] <xhoy> Cork: i noticed :P so you would just scroll down the api list :)
[02:21:40] <Cork> well there are categories
[02:21:55] <Cork> so just find the category you want and look for what description of the function
[02:22:07] <Cork> and yes that is how i do it
[02:22:52] <xhoy> aah the categories, they are not that obvious thanks for the advice!
[02:26:19] <Joey__> do you think it would be feasible to write a rich webapplication that uses jquery client side and only a json REST server and STATIC files server side. So no active server pages (ASP.NET, PHP) that are build server side at all?
[02:31:43] <Joey__> I'm thinking for things like displaying lists your static file could contain an empty element that acts as a template to copy and populate with jquery...
[02:32:13] <Joey__> to log on could be done with a rest call as well instead of a submit and post...
[02:32:32] <Cork> Joey__: it is definitely doable
[02:32:46] <Cork> i've even done it (though the json list wasn't static file)
[02:33:23] <Cork> we ended up scrapping it though cause it depanded too much javascript knowledge
[02:33:38] <Joey__> with static file I meant you would have an index.html that is served by your server as entrypoint, that could contain some elements to use as templates.
[02:33:49] <Cork> exactly
[02:34:06] <Cork> the entire page i was talking about was js generated
[02:34:26] <Cork> if was basically a remote terminal :)
[02:34:33] <Joey__> I'm thinking this would mean you could have a low spec device as server and move the processing to the client
[02:34:35] <Cork> with windows and taskbars and menus
[02:34:50] <jojoba> can we hide a page written in jquery mobile
[02:34:55] <Cork> as long as the client doesn't need to modify things, then sure
[02:35:07] <jojoba> like $("#pageone").hide()
[02:35:15] <jojoba> since it is not working for me
[02:36:29] <Joey__> I saw VIC20 and C64 emulator in javascript the other day. bonkers :)
[02:37:19] <Cork> Joey__: well theres been linux kernel ported to js and gameboy, gameboy color and gameboy advanced for ages
[02:37:26] <jojoba> have I asked anything wrong
[02:37:59] <Cork> jojoba: most active ppl in here doesn't use jqm so you will have to be prepared to wait
[02:38:12] <jojoba> do they hate it ?
[02:38:12] <Joey__> jojoba maybe set display to none using the attr thingie?
[02:38:50] <Cork> jojoba: it is a very js eccentric framework that basically redirects to a separate page if you don't have js
[02:39:04] <Cork> so it breaks progressive enhancement
[02:39:09] <Cork> so, ya i don't like it
[02:41:50] <jojoba> Cork: honestly I hate it too
[02:41:53] <jojoba> and it looks ugly
[02:41:58] <jojoba> If I am allowed to say that
[02:43:33] <zeroquake> Anyone know the max value date object can have?
[02:43:59] <Cork> jojoba: i never evaluate a ui framework on there theme
[02:44:12] <Cork> cause if the framework is built correctly that should be easy to change
[02:44:29] <jojoba> Cork: I honestly would have never used it if I did not have to
[02:44:42] <Cork> zeroquake: depends on the arch of the machine + browser
[02:44:50] <jojoba> but what framework would you recommend for mobile and tab applications
[02:44:57] <Cork> zeroquake: and the size of what you add to the object
[02:45:11] <Cork> on a 32bit system i would guess at around 1.8gb of data
[02:45:12] <jojoba> or do you prefer the different language altogether
[02:45:41] <zeroquake> var d = new Date();
[02:45:42] <zeroquake> d.setTime(8640000000000000);
[02:45:42] <zeroquake> document.write(d);
[02:45:46] <Cork> jojoba: personally i prefer to build a working html + css site
[02:45:54] <Cork> jojoba: and then add js ontop to make things smoother
[02:46:11] <Cork> so basically html + css + core jquery.js
[02:46:33] <Cork> zeroquake: don't use document.write...
[02:46:36] <Cork> ever
[02:46:38] <Cork> EVER
[02:47:35] <zeroquake> i just copy pasted it from stack overflow
[02:47:50] <zeroquake> am going to use one tenth of that value
[02:51:59] <jojoba> Cork: how would you make it work on mobile
[02:52:08] <jojoba> using media queries ?
[02:52:19] <Cork> ah, depends
[02:52:39] <Cork> some sites need to drastically change what the do if they are on mobile
[02:53:01] <jojoba> so how do you achieve that
[02:53:09] <Cork> there i have a test that picks (based on ua) if it thinks you are desktop or mobile (it offers a button to switch if it guessed wrong)
[02:53:26] <Cork> for simpler differences i prefer to use media queries
[02:54:02] <Cork> the desktop/mobile gets entered into the url
[02:54:13] <Cork> so no cookie or user pref needs to be stored
[02:54:41] <Cork> fqdn/path/that/will/guess/your/type => fqdn/mobile/path/that/will/guess/your/type
[02:54:43] <Cork> for example
[02:55:03] <jojoba> even session can be used only on the web service end
[03:00:50] <jojoba> Cork: have you heard of the case when mobile.changePage() event would open up a page embedded in another
[03:01:07] <jojoba> huge first page that has second page on top of it
[03:01:23] <jojoba> I am opening #two and and I seeing #two and at the back #one
[03:01:43] <Cork> if an ajax got a full page but expected a partial i could expect that to happen
[03:01:54] <Cork> but like i said, i don't know jqm well enough to say
[03:05:02] <l0kan> Hi guys, I'm abit of a novice when it comes to jquery, But I have done a script that is suppose to check two divs and then use the height of the largest one for both of them. But I'm having a hard time getting it to work. I'm using wordpress and have enqueued the script. Help would be appreciated :)
[03:07:34] <Cork> l0kan: please make a jsfiddle of the problem
[03:07:38] * Cork afk
[03:58:07] <Ashroyal> Hello
[03:58:11] <norc> Hi. Is there a reason why this is window, rather than the function itself? $.when(1).done(function () { console.log(this) })
[04:00:20] <norc> Or wait.. this would always get set to window when calling a function that is not a property of an object eh?
[04:05:15] <emporio> what does it mean when I console log a string and in the console, I see that string appear multiple times?
[04:15:27] <l0kan> what am I doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/l0kan/rr5unjma/2/
[04:18:34] <taplar> you don't have jquery included for one
[04:18:56] <taplar> also i don't believe $(selector, element) is valid
[04:19:32] <taplar> you can store the 'this' in a local variable and use that inside your child logic
[04:20:26] <Cork> taplar: it is
[04:20:30] <Cork> valid i mean
[04:20:37] <taplar> huh
[04:20:48] <taplar> as far as providing context?
[04:21:00] <Cork> yes
[04:21:10] <taplar> interesting
[04:21:28] <Cork> l0kan: a side note while i debug this, don't use if statements without {}
[04:21:41] <Cork> it is very often a source of bugs
[04:21:49] <Cork> especiall if you line break it as you've done
[04:22:54] <taplar> i tried storing the this as a local variable and replacing later uses of $(this) with it and it seemed to work.  though the box heights were a bit streched
[04:22:59] <Cork> l0kan: highestBox is local to each widget-content
[04:23:13] <Cork> l0kan: so you will check the height of them separately
[04:23:23] <Cork> so they won't affect each others height
[04:24:04] <l0kan> okey! I'll keep that in mind
[04:25:18] <Cork> l0kan: are the image-text-widget-text meant to be sharing  the widget-content parent?
[04:25:32] <Cork> cause that is what the code expects
[04:26:27] <Cork> anyway a cleaned up fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/rr5unjma/3/
[04:26:57] <Cork> l0kan: i need that question answered before i can give you a solution
[04:28:30] <l0kan> I sent u a private message
[04:28:33] <l0kan> did you get it?
[04:30:14] <taplar> imho, this example seems incomplete.  from the code it looks like it's trying to make siblinging widgets have the same height, but the html has widgets without siblings
[04:31:38] <jojoba> taplar: and Cork and regular fellows
[04:31:40] <jojoba> :D
[04:32:01] <taplar> aloha
[04:32:04] <Cork> l0kan: no i don't do private chat
[04:32:54] <jojoba> are you at Hawai taplar
[04:32:57] <jojoba> :D
[04:33:17] <taplar> nah, it's me being lazy.  why not use the word that means hello and goodbye, ^_^
[04:34:18] <taplar> if your not feeling tropical, bonjour!
[04:34:54] <Uhkis> or if you're feeling finnish, moro!
[04:36:04] <taplar> ohh, new one
[04:36:57] <Uhkis> taplar: you don't wanna know how many greetings/goodbyes we have :D
[04:37:18] <taplar> is that more-oh or moe-roe?
[04:37:27] <Uhkis> that's probably because that's all we ever talk
[04:37:40] <Uhkis> more-oh without the h :D
[04:37:47] <taplar> cool
[04:39:50] <taplar> here at jquery we strive to provide diverse information, not restricted just to the domain of the jquery library.
[04:40:10] <taplar> atleast when it comes to greetings
[04:40:32] <taplar> why not farewells, you ask?
[04:40:34] <taplar> because
[04:40:40] <taplar> YOU CANNOT LEAVE
[04:41:00] <taplar> man, turning into a weird morning already
[04:41:09] <Uhkis> https://translate.google.fi/#fi/en/moro google pronounces it perfectly
[04:41:15] <Uhkis> ..on the finnish side
[04:42:04] <taplar> sounds spanish almost with the tongue roll
[04:51:56] <tumulte> hello people
[04:52:34] <tumulte> how can we get '$(this)' in on('click', function() {});
[04:52:36] <tumulte> ?
[04:53:29] <taplar> not sure i understand.  'this' will exist in the handler function
[05:00:22] <emporio> Can anyone tell me a scenario console log of a string occurs three times, even though it has been written once?
[05:00:49] <taplar> the outer logic repeats
[05:00:57] <taplar> such as a function, or a loop
[05:03:12] <Cork> or an event firing of the event multiple times
[05:03:31] <emporio> taplar: would you like to help?
[05:03:48] <emporio> I'd like to know why my string is console loggin three times
[05:04:01] <taplar> provide a fiddle of the problem.  anyone in the room can help
[05:04:16] <emporio> well it's more complicated that putting it in a fiddle
[05:04:26] <emporio> this site: https://www.morerentalcars.com/https://www.morerentalcars.com/
[05:04:29] <emporio> oops
[05:04:30] <emporio> https://www.morerentalcars.com/
[05:04:45] <emporio> book a car and let me know when you're at the third step
[05:05:19] <Cork> ugg... seriously document.write...
[05:05:51] <Uhkis> Cork: what do you think this is, 2015?!
[05:05:58] <emporio> taplar: you're going to want to refresh the page
[05:06:11] <emporio> I just added the console.log('hek');
[05:06:12] <taplar> lol, but i just got to step 2
[05:06:13] <taplar> lol
[05:06:17] <emporio> sorry,
[05:06:17] <davesidious> Hey folks - does anyone know of a decent plugin for a carousel with lightbox functionality?
[05:07:41] <Cork> emporio: you have two div.unbeatable with the same content
[05:07:45] <silverdust> davesidious: why not mix both?
[05:07:52] <emporio> seriously?
[05:07:53] <Cork> emporio: $('.unbeatable').map(function() { return $(this).find('> .text2 >.text2_2').html(); }).get();
[05:07:53] <Cork> [" 18 ", " 17 ", " 20 ", " 19 ", " 16 ", " 17 "]
[05:07:54] <emporio> which page?
[05:08:05] <davesidious> silverdust - so I can navigate through the carousel from the lightbox
[05:08:47] <Cork> emporio: so Amsterdam and London is the same
[05:08:52] <silverdust> oh you can do that with the default lightbox if it's what I think you're talking about
[05:09:17] <emporio> Cork: how you mean?
[05:09:28] <silverdust> you mean open an image and click next to view some other images
[05:09:49] <emporio> Cork: and where do you see two div unbeatable?
[05:09:55] <taplar> you find it cork?  i'm still trying to get to step 3
[05:09:58] <davesidious> silverdust - exactly. So I can open a lightbox on image #2, for example, and be able to nagivate to #1 and #3
[05:10:10] <taplar> ah, there we go
[05:10:16] <Cork> emporio: from the line causing the console.log(oldData)
[05:10:19] <emporio> taplar: when you are step 3, you check the console, you will see the word 'hek' appear 3 times
[05:10:27] <emporio> Even though I console.log once
[05:10:32] <Cork> ah, so not the same thing...
[05:10:50] <Cork> didn't even see the steps >_>
[05:10:52] <taplar> were are you binding step3?
[05:10:53] <toomus> Hi. I need help with regular expression
[05:11:23] <Cork> toomus: ask the question not if anyone are interested in a subject
[05:12:29] <emporio> e
[05:12:48] <emporio> Cork: but does that have anything to do with 'hek' console logged thrice in step 3?
[05:13:06] <Cork> as i completely missed any steps to reproduce, most likely no
[05:13:11] <emporio> taplar: binding?
[05:13:21] <Cork> and i still can't find the steps -_-'
[05:13:23] <taplar> step3 looks like an event handle
[05:13:23] <emporio> it's all happening in script.js
[05:13:30] <taplar> is it not?
[05:13:57] <taplar> i'm asking where step3 is used in the code else where
[05:14:03] <emporio> Step 3 is 'Reserve your car'
[05:14:13] <taplar> but what invokes the function step3?
[05:14:18] <emporio> if you check the console, you see the word 'hek' there thrice
[05:14:37] <emporio> do you want me to add the JS file in a fiddle?
[05:14:40] <taplar> not the action that causes it to happen.  where in the code, is it calling the function
[05:15:34] <emporio> http://jsfiddle.net/emporio/whtz2zfq/1/
[05:15:37] <emporio> there
[05:15:56] <taplar> that's the definition
[05:16:02] <taplar> not the invocation
[05:16:30] <emporio> I don't know then
[05:17:15] <taplar> ok, do this for me then if you would.  replace your hek part with: var error = new Error();  console.log(error);
[05:20:09] <emporio> taplar: ok one moment
[05:20:56] <emporio> done
[05:21:42] <emporio> see, three times error
[05:21:57] <emporio> where do i need to look you think?
[05:22:38] <taplar> fairly large stack trace, one sec
[05:23:53] <emporio> hahaha alright
[05:24:01] <emporio> please don't hack my site
[05:24:22] <taplar> no, this is just a quick and dirty way of being able to see how the logic arrived to the point in your code
[05:24:29] <taplar> it shows the path it took
[05:25:01] <taplar> so if you have the path, you can back track and look for the problem
[05:25:35] <macskay> is there a way to tell the autocomplete plugin to listen to another json format?
[05:25:37] <taplar> though it's more useful in chrome than firefox, cause chrome will let you click the links and go to the spot in the code
[05:26:37] <Cork> macskay: sure, just use a function instead of an url
[05:26:44] <Cork> then you can translate anything you want into what it wants
[05:27:33] <emporio> taplar: you said it
[05:28:38] <taplar> what is CT?
[05:29:15] <emporio> CT?
[05:29:17] <taplar> the stack trace goes into the ct_core which is minified so i can't tell much there.  but you have the CT variable
[05:29:26] <emporio> that's an abbreviation for the partner i work with CarTrawler
[05:29:39] <taplar> how is that variable used?
[05:29:55] <emporio> it's used to invoke all the steps of the booking process
[05:30:05] <emporio> check the first JS file of the error trace
[05:30:10] <emporio> you will see there var CT
[05:30:31] <taplar> yeah i see the definition, but i don't see it passed into a function, or used in a function
[05:32:00] <taplar> does the ct_core just know to look for a global CT variable to use?
[05:33:36] <emporio> probably yes
[05:33:47] <emporio> I didn't build this site
[05:33:56] <emporio> it was done through instructions provided by CT
[05:34:02] <emporio> by some other developer
[05:34:11] <emporio> and now I just want to append something at step 3
[05:34:13] <emporio> where the button is
[05:34:20] <emporio> but, it's appending twice and thrice
[05:34:23] <emporio> instead of once
[05:34:35] <emporio> appending it does twice, and console.logging thrice
[05:34:37] <emporio> very odd
[05:35:08] <taplar> k, well as it is i'm not sure I can find the issue, as the stack trace goes into the ct_core and is minified, so i can't tell heads or tails of it
[05:35:17] <taplar> question though, does this happen for the other steps?
[05:35:35] <emporio> gosh i dont know, let me place some console.logs there
[05:35:39] <emporio> brb
[05:37:14] <emporio> ok done
[05:37:20] <emporio> I added a log for each step
[05:37:31] <taplar> see if they repeat
[05:37:32] <emporio> STEP1, "2 etc
[05:37:59] <emporio> STEP1 twice
[05:38:30] <emporio> STEP2 7 times
[05:38:31] <emporio> omg
[05:38:36] <taplar> :)
[05:38:40] <emporio> Step3 threice
[05:38:42] <taplar> i'd say the ct_core has issues
[05:38:43] <emporio> thirce
[05:38:49] <emporio> thrice
[05:38:57] <emporio> that's not good then
[05:39:36] <taplar> here's another idea.  console.log the obj passed in
[05:40:16] <taplar> maybe there are multiple objects it is matching on and operating on
[05:40:22] <taplar> maybe ct is expecting only one of each
[05:40:26] <taplar> dunno
[05:41:18] <l0kan> taplar cork I messed around some with the code https://jsfiddle.net/l0kan/rr5unjma/ I got it working in fiddle, but Im having a hard time getting it working on the site.
[05:46:01] <emporio> taplar: maybe we should console.log CT ?
[05:46:26] <taplar> we can see it's definition.  what is lost is the use of it in the core
[06:04:04] <toomus> How with regularr expression match :text:, but not match :text?
[06:04:21] <taplar> :text[^:]
[06:04:48] <taplar> or wait
[06:05:05] <taplar> is :text: a special operator?
[06:05:21] <toomus> taplar: no text is just exmaple
[06:05:35] <toomus> it could be :anything:
[06:05:49] <taplar> well it shouldn't match, as the second does not have the last :
[06:06:01] <taplar> ^:whatever:$
[06:06:02] <toomus> taplar: but it does

[06:09:35] <powtac> What does $.makeArray() do with this code?
[06:09:39] <powtac> obj = {hersteller_zugeordnet: false}; obj = $.makeArray(obj); console.log(obj.hersteller_zugeordnet);
[06:09:43] <toomus> taplar: Ah OK :)
[06:10:45] <taplar> powtac: it's making an array of that one object
[06:11:00] <taplar> why are you trying to turn an object into an array?
[06:11:24] <powtac> taplar, why is a boolean value not preserved?
[06:11:30] <taplar> it is
[06:12:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cu0td2s8/
[06:12:58] <powtac> Docs say "Convert an array-like object into a true JavaScript array" https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[06:13:09] <shoky_> that's not an array-like object
[06:13:13] <taplar> an object is not an array like object
[06:13:21] <shoky_> that use of $.makeArray is just wrong
[06:13:31] <taplar> again, why are you wanting to turn an object into an array?
[06:16:13] <powtac> I want to iterate trough all properties of my obj
[06:16:32] <Cork> powtac: you use $.each for that
[06:16:35] <powtac> Btw, this is how it looks like https://jsfiddle.net/cu0td2s8/1/
[06:16:36] <taplar> you can already do that either with Object.keys(object).forEach() or for (key in object) {}
[06:16:55] <powtac> I used .map() ... probably the wrong way?
[06:17:04] <Cork> map is ok too
[06:17:11] <Cork> you don't use makeArray though
[06:17:22] <Cork> meaning you shouldn't use
[06:17:40] <taplar> it's just a different method of iteration.  no need to convert to use one method
[06:17:54] <Cork> makeArray is for things like and array like object is { '0': 'something', '1': 'something', '2': 'something', length: 3 } => ['something', 'something', 'something']
[06:18:11] <Cork> uh...
[06:18:26] <Cork> makeArray is for thinks like { '0': 'something', '1': 'something', '2': 'something', length: 3 } => ['something', 'something', 'something']
[06:18:36] <Cork> wow... that was one weird typo...
[06:19:19] <Cork> powtac: also don't use map if you don't plan on generating an array
[06:20:06] <powtac> Ok, thanks. I will update the fiddle and come back, my problem still exists!
[06:20:18] <Cork> powtac: https://jsfiddle.net/cu0td2s8/2/
[06:21:15] <Cork> updated to show when you should use each https://jsfiddle.net/cu0td2s8/3/
[06:25:15] <helvetet> How come when i use $.ajax and the url is "/folder/page.php" i get a XMLHttpRequest Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP. error

[06:26:13] <helvetet> po
[06:26:14] <helvetet> pos
[06:27:52] <helvetet> nvm i had a javascript:void(0) on the triggered item
[06:37:15] <powtac> Thanks! @Cork and @taplar I found my mistake: https://jsfiddle.net/cu0td2s8/6/ due a very long script I did not realize that my "a" value was set after the console.log. I was confused since it was actually initalized with "undefined"....
[06:37:38] <taplar> cool
[06:40:07] <soft_delete> Hi everyone ! I am using jQuery autocomplete and I am wondering if the following is possible: Let's say I want to find a result called 'Spånskruer 4,5*60mm' , so instead of typing the whole thing I want to type just 'Spå 4,5'and get the result. Is that doable with jQuery autocomplete ?
[06:40:42] <taplar> your back end would have to do the wildcarding
[06:42:37] <taplar> if your getting your options from an ajax request that is
[06:43:02] <soft_delete> Yes I am getting them through ajax
[06:43:31] <taplar> yep, so your backend matcher would have to do it's selection with a modified value that follows your wildcarding rules
[06:44:26] <taplar> for your example, if you are hitting a sql like database it could possibly be: column like ''Spå% 4,5%'
[06:46:55] <powtac> soft_delete have a look at the contains() selector: https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[06:47:51] <Cork> soft_delete: that is how the autocomplete functions naturally
[06:47:56] <Cork> you don't need to do anything
[06:48:22] <powtac> you could split your search query by " " and run a contains selector for each of the parts on your AJAX result list and all entries that mach ALL different parts are matches....
[06:48:29] <Cork> no
[06:48:35] <Cork> you don't need to split it
[06:54:34] <soft_delete> So as far as I understand I should fetch all my data first and then let the autocomplete do it's magick because curently I am making a new ajax call for each character typed..

[07:33:28] <Cork> you mean you want it to overflow the photo element?
[07:35:07] <isthisreallife> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zvOZww  i need this effect
[07:35:19] <isthisreallife> but without changing html
[07:35:30] <Cork> isthisreallife: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwKqdX ?
[07:36:08] <Cork> opps hmm it broke
[07:36:19] <isthisreallife> thankss

[07:37:47] <EC_Joe> hey guys I'm trying to associate a row which is about to be rendered to a javascript object. See line 12 of http://pastebin.com/SDEhaixX . Unsurprisingly it doesn't seem to be tying that html out to the DOM so i'm not sure how I can select only within the context of what I just added... any tips?
[07:44:17] <nekrum_> Hi
[07:45:36] <taplar> EC_Joe: line 12 should work so long as that variable is valid html and the class is a child of it
[07:45:48] <nekrum_> I have a very basic question, and I don't know whre to look for.
[07:46:03] <taplar> nekrum_: just ask, don't be shy
[07:47:55] <nekrum_> thanks taplar, I want to change destroy the modal, but I have read that fade class is a problem, I find this answer... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26246968/bootstrap-fade-class-blocking-hidden-bs-modal-event-bootstrap-3-0-21
[07:48:21] <MXBrandon> Is it possible to select a pseudo element to change something?               $('.someclass').each(function() { $(this).find(':after').css('content', '...'); } );
[07:49:18] <nekrum_> I include the code in the head of my document, but I don't know if is just that code or, I need to add more code.
[07:50:46] <taplar> MXBrandon: you can do that, though the each isn't really needed i don't believe
[07:51:41] <taplar> unless what your setting content to is different, of course
[07:52:25] <MXBrandon> taplar: The each() was because I was trying to set it to all elements .someclass elements on the page
[07:52:49] <taplar> if you do an operation off of a selector that has found multiple elements, it will perform it on all of them
[07:53:00] <MXBrandon> Sorry, there was more to the function...it ran an if statement before updating it
[07:53:18] <MXBrandon> I only wanted it to apply to elements with a height greater than Y
[07:53:35] <taplar> ah
[07:54:07] <MXBrandon> I am not able to select on the pseudo element for some reason though
[07:54:16] <MXBrandon> no error in console. Just no result
[07:54:32] <taplar> i'm unfamiliar with the :after clause
[07:54:41] <MXBrandon> k
[07:55:28] <taplar> verbally what are you trying to do?
[07:55:38] <BillCriswell> You can't select pseudo elements. You'll need to give the element the pseudo is on a class and alter it like .foo.alter::after {}
[07:57:54] <taplar> oh, i see what it's doing.  that interesting
[07:58:08] <taplar> appending text/image
[07:58:46] <taplar> i'd imagine you could just do the appending with jquery, rather than trying to adjust css to do it for you
[07:58:57] <taplar> seems kinda round-a-bout
[08:00:51] <MXBrandon> I'll give that a shot, thanks
[08:02:08] <EC_Joe> taplar: it kind of works... the problem is that it's not tying out to the rendered dom, it's tying it to the variable instance
[08:03:25] <taplar> well, if the variable contains html rather than a reference to the dom element, then yeah, it would be detached
[08:04:00] <taplar> instead of getting the existing element's html, you'd want to just look it up and use that reference
[08:04:24] <EC_Joe> I think I might have it here...
[08:04:42] <EC_Joe> ya got it
[08:04:51] <EC_Joe> thanks
[08:05:00] <taplar> cool
[08:05:22] <MXBrandon> ok, that worked
[08:06:00] <rtd1123> I have a page that gets content updated every 2 mins via an AJAX call. How can I force my jQuery script to execute when that call happens. Right now it's a ready() function, but that only works on page load.
[08:06:30] <MXBrandon> I only wanted to add :after {content:'...'} if an elements height was over Xpx.  So I just added   .someclass_after:after {}   to my CSS sheet, then used .addClass() to add that to the items I wanted.  Perfect
[08:06:32] <MXBrandon> thanks!
[08:06:36] <taplar> rtd1123: logic you want to happen when an ajax call finishes is done in one of it's callback handlers
[08:06:54] <taplar> such as success, failure, done, etc.
[08:07:10] <rtd1123> oh ok, so just insert there, got yah, thanks so much!
[08:08:26] <taplar> MXBrandon: perfect, :)
[08:09:17] <taplar> MXBrandon: out of curiosity, did you use filter?
[08:10:47] <jak2000> hi all, anyone can try help me with this problem: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/button-into-a-column-on-a-html-table-problem
[08:12:11] <taplar> jak2000: got a fiddle?
[08:12:57] <fas3r> hello
[08:13:10] <taplar> salutations
[08:13:40] <jak2000> hi taplar, not because use mysql data
[08:14:20] <taplar> jak2000: don't need the backend, just an example of the resulting html and the js that operates on it, showing the problem
[08:17:07] <jak2000> my process is: 1) the user click on a select option (choose a item), 2) with ajax i select from a database some data and build a 2 Html table(table1, table2) 3) in table2 i have in a clumn button by row, other column have an id, i need: when user press the button know this id, i have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/2fnRt/640/   work, but in my code stuff, not i think because i create dinamically
[08:17:08] <jak2000> the tables,
[08:17:26] <fas3r> is it possible to add file ressources on fly with jquery ? ( like adding <link>  and <script>  entry )
[08:17:31] <jak2000> http://postimg.org/image/9gbf7yz4f/
[08:18:59] <taplar> jak2000: is verDetalle a class on the button?
[08:19:22] <jak2000> yes
[08:19:47] <taplar> in the fiddle your doing a click event on tr elements.  in the other your doing a click event on a button
[08:20:06] <jak2000> i use java(jsp): wrenglon = "<tr><td class='input_align_right'>" + rs1.getInt("impallentid") + "</td><td>" + rs1.getDate("dmpallentfecha") + "</td><td>" + rs1.getString("cpallcprodcodigo") + "</td>"+ "<td>" + rs1.getString("cpallcclicodigo") + "</td><td class='input_align_right'>" + rs1.getInt("wtotcaj") + "</td><td>"+ "<button type='button' class='verDetalle' >Ver Detalle</button></td></tr>";
[08:21:01] <jak2000> yes i know. but in the fiddle i press on the button and say the alert,
[08:21:06] <taplar> yep
[08:21:12] <taplar> cause the button belongs to the row
[08:21:18] <jak2000> i adapted the code and not worked, i think the problem is that i generate dinamically the tables
[08:21:20] <taplar> click one of the numbers, not the button, still fires
[08:22:04] <jak2000> then, how to fix the problem?
[08:22:10] <jak2000> anything to read?
[08:22:30] <taplar> try in your logic $(this).closest('tr').rowIndex
[08:23:05] <jak2000> ok
[08:23:44] <taplar> since it will be a jquery object at that point you may have to do $(this).closest('tr').prop('rowIndex')
[08:24:03] <taplar> or $(this).closest('tr')[0]rowIndex
[08:24:07] <taplar> or $(this).closest('tr')[0].rowIndex
[08:24:26] <taplar> try it in the fiddle first
[08:24:35] <taplar> change your binding to be on the button, not the row
[08:25:02] <jak2000> you mean: $(document).on('click', '.verDetalle', function () {   right?
[08:25:45] <jak2000> $(document).on('click', '.verDetalle', function () {   alert($(this).closest('tr').rowIndex);   });
[08:25:53] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/2fnRt/642/
[08:25:56] <jak2000> say a message: 'undefined'
[08:26:25] <jak2000> the fiddle say a NaN
[08:27:00] <taplar> yep, so change it to use the $(this).closest....
[08:27:33] <jak2000> $(this).closest('tr')[0]rowIndex   say a syntax error: expected , but found rowIndex
[08:27:47] <taplar> $(this).closest('tr').prop('rowIndex')
[08:28:01] <taplar> or that version, but i missed a . before the rowIndex
[08:28:38] <jak2000> :)
[08:28:43] <jak2000> worked:
[08:28:49] <jak2000> alert($(this).closest('tr')[0].rowIndex);
[08:29:31] <taplar> so you understand why that worked?
[08:29:38] <jak2000> then is correct: var $wRow = $(this).closest("tr"); and for get the value of first cell: var $myId = $wRenglon.find("td:nth-child(1)");  ?
[08:30:04] <taplar> looks right
[08:30:05] <jak2000> error: $wRow =  $(this).closest("tr")[0];
[08:30:23] <taplar> don't break out if you don't have to
[08:31:56] <jak2000> $wRenglon.find is not a function
[08:32:06] <taplar> you named it $wRow
[08:32:41] <jak2000> same. error: $wRow.find is not a function
[08:33:04] <taplar> how are you setting $wRow
[08:33:35] <akahn> I'm using $.ajax to make a cross domain request. I'm using the username and password params, which are supposed to set up an Authorization header on the HTTP request. but when I inspect the request that's made, that header isn't present. am I doing something wrong, or is this not supported, or could it be a bug?
[08:33:49] <akahn> (and the request 401s, so it's not a CORS/cross domain issue)
[08:34:31] <jak2000> $wRow =  $(this).closest("tr")[0];
[08:35:02] <taplar> jak2000: don't use [0] in this case.  that breaks the element out of the jquery object and will keep you from using jquery functions following it, unless you rewrap it
[08:35:11] <jak2000> if i set: $wRow =  $(this).closest("tr");  <-- and check: $wRow.rowIndex say me a message 'undefined'
[08:35:25] <taplar> $wRow.prop('rowIndex')
[08:36:22] <taplar> akahn: what do you mean your using the username and password params?
[08:36:42] <akahn> taplar: see username and password here http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:37:51] <taplar> akahn: so if you go to the url in question, the browser prompts you for a username and password?
[08:37:57] <akahn> yes
[08:38:14] <theskillwithin> difference between   $(this)   vs    this
[08:38:24] <taplar> good, i'm out of ideas then, :s
[08:38:30] <taplar> $(this) is the jquery wrapped version
[08:38:44] <taplar> which 'this' could also be
[08:38:47] <taplar> but probably is not
[08:39:37] <jak2000> taplar worked: $wRow =  $(this).closest("tr");  and then: alert($wRow.prop('rowIndex')); say the correct row number
[08:39:45] <taplar> :)
[08:42:18] <taplar> akahn: does the request actually work?
[08:42:30] <jak2000> now how to get the value of the first cell?
[08:42:38] <akahn> taplar: wydm? it seems to as the server responds with 401 not authorized
[08:43:38] <taplar> akahn: just curious cause in that documentation i don't see mention of it creating headers.  just that it uses those for that server prompt.
[08:43:53] <akahn> taplar: that server prompt is then used to construct an Authorization header
[08:44:08] <akahn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side
[08:44:24] <akahn> I managed to work around it using beforeSend and setting the header manually. thank you.
[08:44:52] <taplar> yeah, that's another reason i was saying that because i've seen the documentation for creating that header manually
[08:45:44] <taplar> jak2000: you can get the value of a cell with either html() or text()
[08:46:14] <jak2000> ok making a fiddle
[08:56:09] <jak2000> taplar: done.
[08:56:23] <jak2000> var $myId = $wRow.find("td:nth-child(1)").text();
[08:56:34] <jak2000> thanks
[08:57:12] <taplar> there ya go, though take off the $ from that variable.  usually putting a $ at the start of a variable is meant to signify that it should contain a jquery object.  but in this case it contains text so it could be confusing later
[08:57:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:58:05] <taplar> moro robert!
[08:58:50] <robertmaxrees> whuddup
[08:59:04] <taplar> Ukhis taught me a new word, :)
[08:59:11] <robertmaxrees> and that was?
[08:59:19] <taplar> moro.  finnish for hello
[08:59:24] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[09:00:13] <Uhkis> taplar: that's just rude, it was me, not some Ukhis! :D
[09:00:32] <taplar> crud, wondered why auto complete didn't work.  thought you left
[09:01:16] <taplar> fyi, i bugged the peeps in my office with my new word too.  you've helped me annoy them for the day, ^_^
[09:01:31] <Uhkis> haha
[09:02:01] <Uhkis> maybe i should tell you that it's mostly used in the area i live in, "moi" would be more general version of it
[09:03:19] <taplar> huh, so is moro kinda a slang version?
[09:03:53] <oddvar> moro means fun in norwegian
[09:04:25] <Uhkis> taplar: kinda yeah
[09:21:30] <theskillwithin> how do I find in the location path ?viewfullsite=1
[09:21:32] <theskillwithin> I  don't think it is in pathname
[09:21:46] <robertmaxrees> it's not apart of the path :)
[09:21:50] <robertmaxrees> window.location.search
[09:22:02] <robertmaxrees> or window.location.href for the entire url.
[09:23:02] <theskillwithin> window.location.href.indexOf("?viewfullsite=1") > 1    ?
[09:23:16] <robertmaxrees> check the window.location.pathname instead
[09:23:50] <theskillwithin> yea I  tired that first, it doesnt have the ?=  kind of stuff in it tho
[09:24:00] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's everything after the ?
[09:25:12] <robertmaxrees> errr, actually it includes that.
[09:25:21] <robertmaxrees> ? and everything after
[09:26:05] <theskillwithin> nope
[09:26:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:26:11] <theskillwithin> it cuts off anything after ? or #
[09:26:12] <robertmaxrees> just checked.
[09:26:14] <theskillwithin> for me
[09:26:28] <robertmaxrees> window.location.search contains the entire search string.
[09:28:12] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLUtils/search - "The URLUtils.search property is a DOMString containing a '?' followed by the parameters of the URL."
[09:52:50] <robertmaxrees> muahahahahaha
[09:52:58] <robertmaxrees> i'm finally getting us a sane email validation setup.
[10:04:26] <jak2000> is possible, with the ajax function, return a html, and json parameters? something: $.ajax({ method: "post",           url: "ajax/a_pallcmapasala.jsp", data: {  "xidsala": widsala,  "xtypo": 1   } }).done(function (xhtml) {    <--- xhtml contain a HTML TABLE, i want too return a json parameters, how to?
[10:05:52] <mentoc> Is there a way to trigger an event when an element becomes visible? For example, we have a gallery of images. We show one image at a time. We don't want to load all images on page load because that slows it down. So instead we want to load the image when the user hits the next button
[10:06:13] <mentoc> i think i just answered my question
[10:06:24] <mentoc> I'll just link the code to the "next" button duh
[10:07:29] <Elyx00> :) mentoc
[10:08:31] <Elyx00> You just experimented the rubber duck mentoc
[10:08:47] <Elyx00> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[10:10:00] <taplar> earnie was a programmer?
[10:20:31] <aquaone> Elyx00: i had never heard of rubber duck debugging before, lol
[10:20:53] <taplar> just another buzz word
[10:21:07] <robertmaxrees> not really a buzzword.
[10:21:09] <robertmaxrees> imo.
[10:21:19] <Elyx00> \_o<
[10:21:56] <taplar> it's not new.  programmers have done that forever.  some one writes a book, and gave it a name.  big whoop
[10:22:16] <robertmaxrees> giving it a name and encouraging people to do it isn't a bad thing :)
[10:22:30] <taplar> not my point, ;)
[10:26:08] <robertmaxrees> then what is your point?
[10:26:26] <robertmaxrees> feels like you're being a contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian and that point.
[10:28:21] <taplar> dunno.  it just feels like one of those cases were someone gave something that's been around forever a name, just as a hey, i did this!
[10:28:46] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[10:28:58] <taplar> ya know?  maybe not.  i dunno the author
[10:29:15] <robertmaxrees> it's a story.  it helps you remember to actually do the thing.
[10:32:29] <claytonzaugg> What would cause a webkit based browser to require a javascript heavy site, to resize the window by at least 1 pixel before the mouse wheel will let you scroll? Firefox, as soon as it loads I can mousewheel scroll no problem.
[10:34:20] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg webkit or blink?
[10:34:32] <claytonzaugg> webkit, specifically chrome and safari
[10:34:39] <robertmaxrees> chrome isn't webkit anymore fwiw.
[10:34:44] <robertmaxrees> uses a fork of webkit.
[10:35:05] <claytonzaugg> AH, I didn't know that, so then my issue is with Chrome and Safari then
[10:35:41] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have something relying on a a resize event.  have you trying enabling/disabling things?
[10:35:41] <claytonzaugg> but the problem still remains
[10:36:12] <jak2000> when i call a ajax function, exist the .fail , how to know wich is the exact error?
[10:36:44] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown are the args pass to the fail function
[10:36:49] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, any guesses as to where I could begin troubleshooting this?
[10:36:57] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the site, no.
[10:37:10] <robertmaxrees> comment out different things and see what happens.
[10:37:11] <claytonzaugg> Too much code, wish I could
[10:37:42] <claytonzaugg> taplar, did you see my question?  Any ideas?
[10:37:42] <jak2000> ok
[10:38:01] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, I'll try that, there aren't that many places where resize occurs
[10:38:16] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg try commenting out entire scripts/plugins on your page.
[10:38:22] <robertmaxrees> you'll narrow it down pretty quick.
[10:38:36] <claytonzaugg> so I'll play around with that, but I don't even know what I'm looking for or what to change that would enable or disable the mousewheel scrolling
[10:39:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something relize on the window resize.
[10:39:03] <claytonzaugg> okay, I'll start breaking things, commenting out functions, to see which one is the culprit
[10:41:28] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {      alert("error ", textStatus); }
[10:41:32] <jak2000> testing :)
[10:41:47] <jak2000> i mean: alert("error "+ textStatus);
[10:42:05] <theskillwithin> onclick="$.removeCookie("YSWSITE", null, { path: '/' });"    is this proper?
[10:42:31] <theskillwithin> code works I think, just idk how to format for inline onclick attribute
[10:42:32] <taplar> not recommended to put javascript logic in your markup
[10:42:43] <theskillwithin> i know, in a tuff spot
[10:43:19] <jak2000> arghh only say: error  :)
[10:43:21] <robertmaxrees> why?
[10:43:30] <robertmaxrees> theskillwithin why are you "in a tuff spot"?
[10:43:43] <jak2000> "parse error"
[10:43:45] <theskillwithin> long story
[10:43:54] <taplar> i like stories
[10:43:57] <theskillwithin> i am dealing with yahoo stores, lets just say that
[10:46:21] <robertmaxrees> can you insert script tags at least?
[10:48:47] <jak2000> wichis a "parse error" ?
[10:51:12] <robertmaxrees> invalid format for the response usually.
[10:55:44] <jquarks> hello
[10:56:26] <taplar> how!
[10:56:37] <taplar> ^ check that out.  i went native american
[10:57:51] <jquarks> I need to append an html structure to an existent one I'm doing it by tracking a class the thing is when I append the structure it gets appended to all the existent class structures
[10:58:17] <taplar> you'll have to filter down more granular to get the one you want
[10:58:19] <jquarks> and i only want to add to that particularly one no duplicates triplicates and so on
[10:58:42] <taplar> which one do you want to add it to?
[10:58:57] <jquarks> check my code at https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8300bde47a16b9c57adb
[10:59:33] <taplar> uh, i mean verbally
[10:59:47] <taplar> right now i'm adding it to all of them, but i really want it added to just .....
[10:59:53] <robertmaxrees> jquarks you mean  $('.interactions').append($action_row).closest(); ?
[11:00:05] <jquarks> yes i'm using that
[11:00:08] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this).append($action_row).closest();
[11:00:17] <jquarks> the problem is that repeats the code everywhere
[11:00:34] <jquarks> to all of the exiting interactions
[11:00:52] <robertmaxrees> right, which is why you want $(this).append($action_row).closest();
[11:01:06] <jquarks> done that does not work
[11:01:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[11:01:41] <robertmaxrees> because i'm flying blind.
[11:03:21] <jquarks> I want to place the $action_row inside the $intervention_row at .interactions class but it breaks the layout because it append near the button I'm "clicking"
[11:03:41] <jquarks> append=appends
[11:03:51] <robertmaxrees> use .closest() and .find() then.
[11:03:54] <robertmaxrees> or make a fiddle.
[11:04:09] <jquarks> jizxx whats a fiddle?
[11:04:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:04:59] <jquarks> ok thak you I will back in a minute
[11:08:45] <robertmaxrees> oh - $(this).closest('.interactions').append($action_row);
[11:08:48] <robertmaxrees> this is probably what you wnat.
[11:09:02] <robertmaxrees> though that assumes i know more about the markup than i actually do.
[11:23:51] <jquarks> toke an age but done it please give a look at it
[11:23:51] <jquarks> http://jsfiddle.net/jquarks/4y1hcuy1/2/
[11:27:29] <robertmaxrees> try $(this).closest('.interactions').append($action_row);
[11:28:16] <decx> we need to have an intervention about all these html strings
[11:40:04] <steven10172> What could be the cause of it messing up like this? http://i.imgur.com/ZpkbF1q.png manCalc values are (eleScreenPos - mouseScreenPos)
[11:40:28] <robertmaxrees> context?
[11:40:44] <steven10172> The position jumps randomly
[11:40:50] <steven10172> offsetX/offsetY*
[11:41:01] <robertmaxrees> position of...?
[11:41:07] <steven10172> They're incorrect on half the screen and correct on the other half. Mousemovement
[11:41:14] <BillCriswell> jquarks, decx This is like.. prime use case for a MVVM.
[11:41:31] <robertmaxrees> steven10172 you posted a screenshot of a console log without any more info.  can't really help without more.
[11:41:45] <jquarks> I know but it can't be done at this stage of project
[11:41:59] <BillCriswell> jquarks: Totally understood.
[11:42:04] <jquarks> have to migrate backend to rest in future
[11:42:15] <jquarks> than MVVM
[11:43:19] <jquarks>      $(".interventions").on( "click", ".fa-plus", function() {         $(this).closest('.interactions').append($action_row);     }); not working
[11:43:27] <jquarks> :)
[11:43:34] <robertmaxrees> "not working" is ephemeral.
[11:43:35] <jquarks> not working
[11:43:39] <jquarks> lol
[11:43:45] <robertmaxrees> it's unemployed?
[11:43:57] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: I'm currently playing with the canvas trying to do some dragging events and it seems that the offsetX and offsetY are incorrect. It randomly jumps from correct to incorrectly off by ~200 x and ~200 y
[11:44:06] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Running this code: http://pastebin.com/f7qFc0Ah
[11:44:17] <jquarks> I've got to go for dippers at the supermarket :( I'll be back
[11:46:01] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: In the console output the offsetX/offsetY are invalid sometimes, but manCalcX/manCalcY should be the correct values based on (mouseScreenPosition - eleScreenPosition)
[11:46:46] <robertmaxrees> jquarks oh, your setup is really strange.  weird.
[11:47:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4y1hcuy1/3/ ew
[11:48:56] <robertmaxrees> steven10172 does it still break if you make a super minimal standalone test case?
[11:51:39] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Yes it does. Only have the following lines: 25, 26, 28, 30, 34
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[11:53:10] <django_> robertmaxrees: always helping ppl :D
[11:53:12] <django_> you the man
[11:55:15] <steven10172> Pattern that I see: 0-17, 0-38, 0-157, 0-300, 473-700
[11:55:48] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: thats the ranges that offsetX seems to work in
[11:57:00] <robertmaxrees> so the offset of a thing changes when you move it?
[11:57:04] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i'm way lost heh
[11:59:03] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: As I move the mouse from left to right across the element jQuery returns the offsetX/offsetY incorrectly. And it has a pattern that it's keeping. Starting from the left of the element it reports 0-17, upon hitting 17 it goes back to 0 and then counts up to 38. Of which does that multiple times in the followin order:  0-17, 0-38, 0-157, 0-300, 473-700
[11:59:22] <steven10172> THe weird part is that after hitting 300 it jumps to 473 and doesn't restart back at 0
[11:59:38] <robertmaxrees> aaaah that's what you're getting at.  i wonder if it's an issue with canvas and jquery maybe?
[11:59:58] <steven10172> #canvas-container is a div holding canvas'
[12:00:06] <steven10172> So no canvas issue here
[12:00:16] <robertmaxrees> eeeeh, i wouldn't be so sure.
[12:00:17] <robertmaxrees> it might be.
[12:00:48] <steven10172> This does it in Chrome too
[12:01:37] <steven10172> Previously I was using Angular with jQLite and this issue also happened, but it did 0-150 and then 0-700. But the issue only arrose on my left monitor and none of the others
[12:02:08] <steven10172> And only in Firefox, so I disapped MaxTo (Screen splitting software) and it stopped, but now this test case using normal jQuery breaks in all browsers
[12:02:25] <robertmaxrees> not sure what to tell you without seeing it in action then.  it sounds like the canvas is emitting the events and making things act all weird.
[12:02:30] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not entirely sure if that's the case.
[12:02:58] <robertmaxrees> using jquery and canvas together is kind of a funky proposition since jquery isn't really equipped to handle it in the first place.
[12:03:43] <steven10172> The events aren't attached the canvas, but the container div so that multiple canvas' can use the same movement
[12:03:50] <robertmaxrees> the events emit from the canvas.
[12:04:00] <steven10172> True
[12:04:01] <robertmaxrees> the handler is attached to the parent element.
[12:04:46] <robertmaxrees> but the event doesn't necessarily emit from the parent element.  i wonder if the event is bubbling causing these issues
[12:04:57] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Issue earlier: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwyYD6JX-tw Shows the random spikes from 20-30 sec
[12:05:10] <robertmaxrees> like if you bound to the canvas directly and stopped that event propogation, what happens?
[12:05:36] <steven10172> ^ video is jQLite with Angular. Doesn't have the same issue as now, just randomly jumps off a few hundred in x position and jumps back
[12:06:11] <gambl0re> whats up robermatrix...
[12:06:17] <robertmaxrees> or check the currentTarget for the event and make sure it's that div container.
[12:10:36] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: currentTarget is correct. Testing against canvas now
[12:10:52] <robertmaxrees> steven10172 hey please don't PM me :)
[12:13:52] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Sorry about that. used notice. Don't usually post that url in channels
[12:14:10] <robertmaxrees> heh, my policy is "if you don't want it in the channel, i don't want it at all" :)
[12:15:14] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: I don't care about public sharing of it. Just was a habit. I tried attaching the events to the canvas and it won't do anything
[12:16:11] <robertmaxrees> PMing/noticing/etc without asking in-channel first is kind of a no-no.  not a big deal.  and you mean the event listener?
[12:16:22] <robertmaxrees> dod you try to stopPropagation on the event?
[12:18:25] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Yep: jQuery('#canvas-shell').on('click', function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); console.log(event); });
[12:18:38] <steven10172> no output
[12:18:40] <robertmaxrees> but are you now getting the right numbers in the console?
[12:19:59] <steven10172> I cannot attach any listeners to the canvas' and still not the right numbers
[12:20:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, my guess is this is caused by jquery not speaking "canvas"
[12:24:04] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Is there anywhere that specifies canvas having issues?
[12:24:15] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM abstraction library.
[12:24:21] <robertmaxrees> not really designed to handle canvas.
[12:25:02] <robertmaxrees> there are plugins and things out there to help ease that a little if you really want.
[12:25:24] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Shouldn't simple mouse/touch events be the same in the canvas?
[12:25:30] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[12:25:47] <robertmaxrees> somebody else may know better, but it's a different technology.  you're held to a different set of rules.
[12:28:07] <jquarks> robertmaxree thank you for your solution, what do you sugest to improve my solution?
[12:28:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:28:43] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Even document.getElementById('canvasContainer').addEventListener("mousemove" has the issue. Might be a problem with my computer?
[12:28:55] <robertmaxrees> steven10172 canvas is not DOM.
[12:29:14] <robertmaxrees> so DOM methods aren't really guaranteed to work.  check out the MDN docs for more info.
[12:29:33] <NightElf> Hello, how to append an option (at the top) to a select element ?
[12:29:43] <NightElf> so it's index is 1
[12:29:45] <robertmaxrees> .prepent()
[12:29:47] <robertmaxrees> *prepend
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> and that's index 0
[12:30:09] <NightElf> well, yeh that works thanks
[12:30:27] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: On this website I have it attached directly to canvas. http://whiteboard.thecontrollershop.com/ lets you click and drag anywhere on the screen without issue
[12:33:03] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) dunno what to tell you at this point.
[12:33:24] <robertmaxrees> just giving you ideas of things to explore.
[13:27:51] <km4> http://prntscr.com/89m2cs whai is wrong guys D: ?
[13:35:49] <Elyx00> km4, nothing but maybe you need a space between if and parenthesis for the course purpose :o ?
[13:35:54] <Elyx00> Or maybe they want you to use "==="
[13:36:37] <totallyquiche> km4: yeah, it's something with Code Academy. I've had a lot of similar issues with them before. Sometimes even just refreshing the page and typing the exact same code works.
[13:42:06] <km4> ;D
[13:55:26] <tasaif> steven10172, what are you trying to do?
[13:55:57] <steven10172> tasaif: Just wanted accurate offsetX/offsetY locations
[13:58:15] <tasaif> did you resolve your problem already?
[13:59:25] <steven10172> tasaif: Nope. Stopped investigating. Will look into it later. That issue above mostely doesn't affect me. I juse jqLite and it works mostly. Just wanted to build an example case for the creator to test
[13:59:53] <tasaif> and you're trying to get x and y coordinates in a canvas?
[14:00:14] <steven10172> No, the div containing the canvas'
[14:00:20] <steven10172> https://github.com/digitalcreations/MaxTo/issues/96 <-- all started with that
[14:00:26] <SoloDolo> can someone take a look. idk what is wrong but the alert is not firing http://laravel.io/bin/xKMr4
[14:01:10] <steven10172> I want to reproduce the issue without publising the new website version. And when testing on current website with a small mousemove statement it freaked out
[14:01:23] <tasaif> SoloDolo, can you put that code in jsfiddle of jsbin or something where I can interact with it and update it?
[14:03:19] <tasaif> steven10172, have you checked with the firefox developers or the maxto developers?
[14:03:28] <tasaif> oh wait, I guess that's what that issue is, kek
[14:05:57] <SoloDolo> tasaif http://jsfiddle.net/szpopmun/
[14:06:50] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/szpopmun/1/
[14:06:58] <tasaif> remove the space between button and .delete-employee
[14:07:45] <tasaif> with the space it means: look for a dom object with the class 'employee' inside of a button tag
[14:07:49] <steven10172> tasaif: I'll just have to wait for the new version of website to go live and let them debug at that point
[14:08:05] <tasaif> without the space it means: look for a dom object with the class 'employee' that is also a button tag
[14:08:32] <tasaif> steven10172, judging by the sound of it, it seems you've hit a corner case
[14:08:55] <tasaif> somebody somewhere didn't see this coming or is shifting the blame on you for wanting weird things
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[14:10:59] <SoloDolo> tasaif event with it removed it doesn't fire
[14:11:30] <steven10172> tasaif: Yep. Only on top split of my left monitor (which is weird part). And without MaxTo that left monitor is ever so slightly delayed in dragging compared to the others. Of which it's my better graphic card and the main one.
[14:11:48] <steven10172> But anyways. Just gotta push it back to the corner for a few weeks and maybe look into it further at that point
[14:12:24] <tasaif> Or stop using MaxTo?
[14:12:33] <tasaif> SoloDolo, the updated link I sent you was working
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw maxto is weird and buggy
[14:13:06] <steven10172> Or that, at least for now
[14:13:20] <robertmaxrees> it's been like that for a while.
[14:13:21] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Have any suggestions on similar software that allow screen splitting?
[14:13:48] <robertmaxrees> maxto was the only decent one i found, but i ditched it once it started wigging out on me.
[14:14:39] <tasaif> steven10172, http://alternativeto.net/software/maxto/
[14:15:07] <robertmaxrees> plus i found that i could do like 90% of the work myself with little fuss.
[14:15:34] <steven10172> It's been good for ~3mo. Just started having issues (~1 week ago). My boss has used it for ~2years with maybe 1 crash and no other issues
[14:17:55] <robertmaxrees> it started drifting panes on me randomly.
[14:18:04] <SoloDolo> i see it does i think its something else im doing
[14:20:42] <robertmaxrees> steven10172 one big point here is if maxto is causing you headaches, it's not something to be terribly concerned with - i'll guess the vast majority of your end users don't have it installed.
[14:22:32] <SoloDolo> im using ajax to dynamically create each li and this is what it looks like http://jsfiddle.net/szpopmun/2/ im sure it has to do with this but can i not do it this way? its been showing correctly on page
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> you need event delegation.
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[14:23:52] <robertmaxrees> also, .delete-employee is not a child of button
[14:24:01] <robertmaxrees> you just need '.delete-employee' to select that one.
[14:24:33] <robertmaxrees> try $('.employee-lists').on('click', 'delete-employee', function() {});
[14:25:54] <SoloDolo> robertmaxrees thank you! that worked!!
[14:26:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:26:27] <robertmaxrees> the problem is you were trying to bind to an element that didn't yet exisy
[14:30:10] <SoloDolo> robertmaxrees man i still have a ways to go in understanding jquery i see...but the event didn't yet exist because it was a child element? Is that what you are saying?
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:30:29] <robertmaxrees> so the event is emitted by the element.
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> the issue is $() can only select things on the page when you call it.
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't magically update.
[14:31:08] <robertmaxrees> it's the same reason doing $('.someElement').css('font-size', '30000px') doesn't work for elements created after you run it.
[14:33:17] <steven10172> robertmaxrees: Does .on(event, selector, fnc) utilize dom mutation events? Or just look for bubbled events?
[14:33:27] <robertmaxrees> just bubbled events.
[14:34:32] <SoloDolo> ohhh ok yes i get what you are saying now.
[14:53:04] <robertmaxrees> boom!
[16:29:33] <tasaif> its so quiet
[16:57:09] <arc_> wow, this is the second page in the last couple weeks i've found that overrides ctrl+f
[16:57:16] <robertmaxrees> yuck
[16:57:21] <arc_> a note to all web designers here: DO NOT DO THAT.
[16:57:38] <robertmaxrees> and developers ;)
[16:57:44] <arc_> sure
[17:02:16] <jak2000> arc_ ? why not
[17:02:56] <robertmaxrees> it's disruptive to the end user.
[17:03:15] <robertmaxrees> overriding basic browser behavior is a no-no
[17:05:21] <arc_> jak2000 because now i have no way of finding text within the page. the only thing i can do is access their search engine
[17:05:29] <arc_> which i could have done with or without the keyboard shortcut
[17:06:05] <robertmaxrees> the end user also has a reasonable expectation that crtl+f does something specific.  kind of like when they reach for their scroll wheel.
[17:07:24] <jak2000> ok and why the developers designers override the ctrl + f ?
[17:09:46] <arc_> i guess because they thought it would be helpful?
[17:10:55] <arc_> i was going to try to figure out where the preventdefault is but the way this code is written is completely insane, i guess probably some purposeful obfuscation after the fact to prevent users from understanding it
[17:11:34] <tasaif> what if I override the ctrl + f to give a more feature rich search functionality?
[17:12:05] <arc_> if it's actually better, and it still searches the text within the page, and doesn't break anything, go for it i guess
[17:12:14] <arc_> seems pretty unlikely though
[17:13:10] <arc_> one problem with that is you'd either have to support every browser individually or risk putting the ui somewhere the user isn't used to
[17:35:06] <sillyslux> arc_, you can open the built-in search from the browser menu if ctrl-f is occupied
[17:35:27] <robertmaxrees> sillyslux we're arguing that you should've override ctrl+f in the first place.
[17:35:54] <sillyslux> yes, and yet it happens
[17:36:08] <robertmaxrees> err, *shouldn't override.
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> bad typo.
[17:36:32] <sillyslux> i tend to forget about browser menus, thus the reminder
[17:36:40] <jak2000> robertmaxrees you working with glassfish?
[17:36:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> ...no?  not sure where you got the impression that i am.
[17:38:59] <jak2000> developer
[17:39:07] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:40:22] <jak2000>  $.ajax({         method: "post",          url: "ajax/a_pallcmapasala.jsp",         data: {            "xidsala": idsala,             "xtypo": 0         },         dataType: 'json'      }).done
[17:40:32] <robertmaxrees> hey, use a paste service instead.
[17:40:41] <robertmaxrees> pasting code like that in the channel is unreadable.
[17:40:56] <jak2000> my webpage: ajax/a_pallcmapasala.jsp   return an html is the cause of the "parse error"
[17:41:18] <robertmaxrees> dataType: 'json'
[17:41:20] <robertmaxrees> kill that.
[17:41:32] <jak2000> i explain more...
[17:41:37] <robertmaxrees> that option is the format you're expecting back from the server.
[17:41:39] <jak2000> see the parameter: xtypo?
[17:41:59] <jak2000> i use same page for return a html table....
[17:42:21] <jak2000> if xtypo=0 return a json if xtypo=1 return html
[17:42:33] <robertmaxrees> you're obviously not returning json :)
[17:42:49] <jak2000> yes i know, i need return in this case a json, the solution is create a separate jsppage right?
[17:43:03] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea how your platform works.
[17:43:23] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of a funky idea though - just make a different endpoint for this.
[17:43:29] <jak2000> ok..
[17:43:34] <smgs> robertmaxrees HI! with your guidance i am able to improve a hell lot with the previous codes etc. ( that is i should learn ). really really REALLY THANKFUL.

[20:41:56] <fas3r> hello
[20:42:10] <fas3r> can I create a function which have a null value ?
[20:42:36] <fas3r> init: function (str === null)  ?
[20:42:42] <nodist> which returns a null value?
[20:43:29] <fas3r> no which can be a null value as parameter
[20:44:07] <jak2000> i have this string (the string is a variable): var wstr='aasklad sk, asdlasjda sdmasd,a sdasd (akasjdl as ,'; how to remove the last "," ?
[20:46:15] <totallyquiche> jak2000: you can use substr()
[20:47:04] <jak2000> wstr2=wstr.substr(1,length(wstr)-2);   ?
[20:47:17] <nodist> jak2000 http://jsfiddle.net/cz51vrsw/1/
[20:47:53] <nodist>  wstr = wstr.replace(/,([^,]*)$/, ' ');
[20:54:29] <jak2000> thanks
[21:36:26] <jak2000> friends when? .val? when .text? when .html?
[22:07:52] <AliG1000> http://jsfiddle.net/hkvfms4d/  I have two input fields in a <tr>.  If the first field is empty but the user starts to type in the second field, I need to highlight the first field.  There are many <tr>s
[22:43:51] <Elyx0> AliG1000 > http://jsfiddle.net/wLsu048k/
[22:44:12] <Elyx0> You can remove the else {}
[22:47:54] <AliG1000> that's certainly one way to do it - thank you
[22:49:38] <jak2000> how to reset the window with jQuery ?
[23:02:07] <km4> how can delete "" in my array ["20-08-2015", "26-08-2015", "24-08-2015", "25-08-2015", "19-08-2015", "17-08-2015", "18-08-2015", "21-08-2015", "27-08-2015"] ?
[23:24:44] <Cork> km4: uh, what ""?
[23:25:05] <Cork> km4: you can't to remove one of the date strings?
[23:27:09] <Cork> jak2000: what do you mean by reset?
[23:29:25] <Uhkis> is there any way to find the "lowest" div without looping through all of them and checking scrollTop + height?
[23:29:44] <Cork> no
[23:30:02] <Cork> well there are other calls you can make instesad of height + scrollTop
[23:30:08] <Cork> but you have to loop the elements
[23:30:12] <Uhkis> damn, because that sounds like a really heavy operation :s
[23:30:17] <Cork> it is
[23:30:27] <Cork> it forces the browser to rerender the page too
[23:30:43] <Cork> so it is a really heavy operation
[23:31:03] <Cork> Uhkis: you could always add a class to the element as you add them and then just check for that class
[23:31:22] <Cork> then it becomes close to free
[23:31:24] <jak2000> Cork any advice for me?
[23:31:34] <Uhkis> *** this base theme, i've spent so much time fixing it's weirdness that i would've been done faster by writing it from scratch
[23:31:45] <Cork> jak2000: not before you answer the question
[23:32:04] <Cork> Uhkis: i know the feeling
[23:32:15] <Cork> luckely i don't do that kind of work anymore, and i don't miss it
[23:32:55] <jak2000> how to reset the window with jQuery ?
[23:33:02] <jak2000> similar to: <input type="reset"  ..
[23:33:09] <jak2000> $('#fpallcmapasala')[0].reset();  not do the work
[23:33:16] <jak2000> $('#fpallcmapasala').trigger("reset");   too not work :(
[23:33:18] <Cork> to quote my self "<Cork> jak2000: what do you mean by reset?"
[23:33:39] <Cork> restore it to the state it was in when the page originally loaded?
[23:33:48] <jak2000> yes
[23:33:56] <Cork> there is no way to do that period
[23:34:02] <Cork> the browser doesn't keep the original state around
[23:34:10] <Cork> the best you can do is window.location.reload()
[23:34:25] <Uhkis> $('input').val(''); ?
[23:34:26] <Cork> that will throw away the page and fetch it again
[23:34:34] <Cork> Uhkis: it isn't for forms
[23:34:38] <Cork> it is for the entire page
[23:34:57] <Uhkis> [09:33] < jak2000> similar to: <input type="reset"  ..
[23:35:08] <Cork> similar ya, but for the page, he said so
[23:35:15] <Cork> also val('') != reset
[23:35:30] <Cork> reset restores the values the form had when the form loaded
[23:35:32] <jak2000> testing: window.location.reload()
[23:35:48] <km4> Cork: nwm the example ;)
[23:36:14] <Cork> km4: well then you have to explain what you want to do, cause the example you use to ask the question makes no sense
[23:36:21] <Cork> you want to remove empty strings or what?=
[23:36:24] <Cork> *?
[23:37:48] <km4> I want remove the mark "
[23:37:55] <Cork> from what?
[23:37:59] <jak2000> do the job
[23:38:58] <Cork> km4: you want to convert the array to a string?
[23:39:07] <km4> i think so
[23:40:04] <Cork> km4: arr.join(',')
[23:40:27] <Cork> for your example it will give you: "20-08-2015,26-08-2015,24-08-2015,25-08-2015,19-08-2015,17-08-2015,18-08-2015,21-08-2015,27-08-2015"
[23:42:22] <jak2000> thanks
[23:43:16] <km4> Cork: thanks
[23:43:53] <Guest30> M0rning
[23:44:42] <Guest30> Hello I am trying to setup a 'div hide and show navigration where I can set the current active div link with some CSS. So far I got this: https://jsfiddle.net/uxj72thk/1/ but I think there must be a more dynamic way of doing this?
[23:46:13] <Cork> Guest30: so you want it to set the color different for the first element and the rest or what?
[23:46:33] <Guest30> Just see it as an 'curent 'active' state
[23:46:39] <Guest30> that's all
[23:46:48] <Cork> so the color should be the same?
[23:47:07] <Duikb00t> * Changed nick *
[23:47:07] <Duikb00t> yes
[23:47:18] <Duikb00t> The color should be the same.
[23:52:40] <Duikb00t> So the color is always the same when 'active'.
[23:54:47] <Cork> Duikb00t: https://jsfiddle.net/uxj72thk/2/
[23:55:06] <Cork> opps forgot to remove var open
[23:55:22] <Duikb00t> That's awesome
[23:55:22] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/uxj72thk/3/
[23:55:31] <Duikb00t> So you used on instead of click
[23:55:44] <Cork> i delegated the click handler to the .menu element
[23:55:59] <Cork> so you don't have static click handlers on each element
[23:56:05] <Duikb00t> Oh ok :)
[23:56:08] <Cork> Duikb00t: also i removed the abuse of <a>
[23:56:21] <Cork> as you don't provide links you shouldn't use them
[23:56:39] <Duikb00t> oh indeed
[23:56:40] <Duikb00t> Im not 'referencing' anywhere
[23:56:58] <Cork> for accessibility you might want to add a <button> inside the li
[23:57:04] <Cork> or set aria attributes
[23:57:35] <Cork> a simple <li role="button"> should be enough
[23:57:39] <Duikb00t> Really nice
[23:58:15] <Cork> Duikb00t: it will work with dynamically added elements too
[23:58:28] <Cork> and the code won't have to be modified to work with new content
[23:58:39] <Duikb00t> That's really nice
[23:59:26] <Duikb00t> Thanks for your help, Cork
[23:59:30] <Cork> np
