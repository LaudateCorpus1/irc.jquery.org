[08:50:07] <irondew> https://pastebin.com/NKr41HB9 Guys did I screw up something here? 'closenav' doesnt work
[08:56:18] <irondew> Any1 alive here? :(
[09:22:43] <ryan_ford> boy that's some spacious code you've got there
[09:23:49] <irondew> ryan_ford: u know what might be wrong here? :/
[09:27:42] <ryan_ford> do the other functions work?
[09:29:44] <irondew> Sure
[09:29:47] <irondew> opennav works
[09:33:08] <ryan_ford> not sure without seeing a live example tbh
[09:34:10] <ryan_ford> things I would try it, console logging this.menu to make sure it's the right object, checking to see if it has the class you're trying to remove
