[00:00:04] <Cork> FilipNortic: so use .bind
[00:00:07] <Cork> or delegate
[00:00:18] <dekiss2> how to give event listeners on all elements with one class and when cliekd to give height to other elements
[00:01:01] <FilipNortic> Cork: I use bind, all other triggers work .bind('keyup paste mouseup change',..
[00:01:24] <FilipNortic> but paste doen't trigger until i click beside the field
[00:01:33] <Cork> dekiss2: what is the relation between the elements?
[00:01:58] <Cork> FilipNortic: no if it only happens when you clock beside you get change
[00:02:04] <dekiss2> ok I want soething like when clicked a - the child of b (b is sibling of a) to get height 200px
[00:02:37] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', '.a', function() { $(this).siblings('b').height(200); })
[00:02:42] <Cork> opps
[00:02:45] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', '.a', function() { $(this).siblings('.b').height(200); })
[00:03:01] <shoky> forgot .children()
[00:03:06] <Cork> no
[00:03:26] <shoky> welp ok then one of us misunderstood him ;p
[00:03:33] <shoky> probably both.
[00:03:42] <Cork> ya, the text can be read several ways...
[00:03:58] <Cork> dekiss2: try clarify the relation...
[00:04:06] <shoky> e.g. jsfiddle
[00:10:15] <dekiss2> Cork parent can be class?
[00:10:30] <Cork> dekiss2: and be anything
[00:10:30] <dekiss2> hm
[00:10:36] <dekiss2> ok nice
[00:10:40] <Cork> elements, selectors anything you can normally use
[00:10:44] <dekiss2> Cork you spiled water on the keyboard?
[00:10:57] <Cork> sorry?
[00:11:04] <dekiss2> <Cork> dekiss2: and be anything
[00:11:06] <dekiss2> nvm
[00:11:07] <dekiss2> :)
[00:11:10] <Cork> heh
[00:11:12] <dekiss2> Cork thanks
[00:11:28] <Cork> opps, no just me thinking half of the sentence before i start typing :)
[00:13:09] <dekiss2> Cork http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRfuAukYTKg
[00:14:01] <dekiss2> a.onclick function () {party party!}
[00:15:14] <FilipNortic> Okej can't get paste to trigger in jquery 1.6 either, http://jsfiddle.net/filipnortic/aQNjp/
[00:15:31] <FilipNortic> can someone take a look
[00:15:36] <xec> FilipNortic: try "input"
[00:16:15] <FilipNortic> that works thanks
[00:16:59] <xec> (and remove the others)
[00:17:25] <felixjet_> how can i get the label of a checkbox, when im clicking on a checkbox?
[00:17:47] <Cork> felixjet_: depends on how you connect them
[00:17:49] <dekiss2> cork help
[00:17:51] <felixjet_> i mean when using a change() event
[00:17:55] <dekiss2> I will tell you the family tree ok?
[00:17:56] <felixjet_> on the checkbox
[00:18:01] <felixjet_> $(this) will be the checkbox
[00:18:05] <Cork> $(this).closest('label')
[00:18:06] <felixjet_> but... how i can select the label?
[00:18:08] <dekiss2> pls help my mind is blocked
[00:18:09] <Cork> if it is wrappign it
[00:18:11] <dekiss2> so
[00:18:13] <felixjet_> its not :(
[00:18:21] <felixjet_> markup is <div><input></div><label>
[00:18:24] <FilipNortic> What is the differnce between paste and inout?
[00:18:29] <FilipNortic> input
[00:18:50] <dekiss2> .b is clicked.                  The child that is in A gets height 200px              A is sibling of B  (but they hate eachoteher)
[00:19:07] <felixjet_> Cork, any other idea?
[00:19:08] <xec> felixjet_: .parent().next() if you can rely on the structure or $("label#"+this.id) if you can't
[00:19:12] <Cork> felipe`: this.labels
[00:19:26] <felixjet_> they are linked btw
[00:19:33] <Cork> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/forms.html#dom-lfe-labels
[00:19:33] <felixjet_> i mean <input id="bla"> and <label for="bla">
[00:20:01] <felixjet_> $("label#"+this.id) wouldnt be faster than parent().next() ?
[00:20:16] <Cork> parent().next() is about the fastest you can get
[00:20:42] <xec> felix sorry, $("label[for="+this.id+"]")
[00:21:10] <dekiss2> Cork ?
[00:21:12] <dekiss2> anyone
[00:21:14] <xec> felixjet_*
[00:21:22] <felixjet_> ill use  parent().next() then
[00:21:28] <felixjet_> thanks for the options!
[00:22:53] <dekiss2> Cork cmon man
[00:23:22] <Zahlii> hey guys
[00:23:42] <Cork> dekiss2: i don't think you have clarified the structure yet
[00:23:46] <Cork> or i've missed it
[00:24:03] <Zahlii> i am having a little problem with understanding deferred, I am trying to get the following code to work: http://jsfiddle.net/J2b5F/
[00:24:06] <dekiss2> you missed :S
[00:24:10] <dekiss2> are you sleeping man :S
[00:24:14] <dekiss2> pls I have to go to bed
[00:24:21] <dekiss2> or ill fall asleep on keyboard
[00:24:31] <Cork> so paste the link again then
[00:24:36] <xec> Cork: i can't find any docs for the "labels" property on mdn, do you know what the browser support is like?
[00:24:36] <dekiss2> .b is clicked.                  The child that is in A gets height 200px              A is sibling of B  (but they hate eachoteher)
[00:24:52] <Cork> xec: i'm currently looking for it
[00:24:54] <dekiss2> >>
[00:24:59] <dekiss2> >> alert()
[00:25:00] <Cork> and no i can't find ANY implementation
[00:25:01] <Cork> :/
[00:25:09] <Cork> pitty would have been nice
[00:26:27] <dekiss2> aaaaaa
[00:26:31] <dekiss2> Cork im fallin
[00:26:35] <dekiss2> you ll tell no
[00:26:40] <dekiss2> pls faster
[00:27:01] <Cork> dekiss2: <shoky> e.g. jsfiddle <--
[00:27:02] <dekiss2> ahhhhhhhhh

[00:27:12] <dekiss2> im fallin
[00:27:16] <dekiss2> ok lets do this tomorrow
[00:27:20] <Cork> then go to sleep
[00:27:20] <dekiss2> bye
[00:27:21] <Zahlii> guys it is 9 in the morning, stahp :D
[00:27:24] <xec> Cork: seems to work in chrome at least
[00:27:29] <xec> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/77b3z/1/
[00:28:15] <Cork> xec: hmm interesting
[00:28:23] <Zahlii> above works for me
[00:28:53] <xec> Zahlii: my link? what browser
[00:29:29] <Zahlii> chrome
[00:29:53] <xec> yeah, i tested ie and fx too, but no luck
[00:30:33] <Cork> xec: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=556743
[00:32:01] <felixjet_> mmmmmm
[00:32:05] <felixjet_> $(this).parent().next()
[00:32:10] <felixjet_> gives me the input object
[00:32:13] <felixjet_> not the label
[00:32:25] <Cork> what?
[00:32:37] <felixjet_> prevObject: x.fn.x.init[1], context: input#test0.checkbox,
[00:33:15] <felixjet_> what im doing wrong?
[00:33:19] <Cork> ok, can you make a fiddle with the structure?
[00:33:33] <xec> felixjet_: then you lied about the html :D
[00:33:33] <felixjet_> markup is <li><div><input></div><label></label></li>
[00:33:38] <felixjet_> no :(
[00:33:52] <xec> felixjet_: make a demo please
[00:35:01] <Zahlii> could you take a quick look at http://jsfiddle.net/J2b5F/1/ ?
[00:36:05] <Cork> felixjet_: http://jsfiddle.net/UzLtg/
[00:36:06] <xec> Zahlii: you seem to have put a console.log() call directly in the then()
[00:36:22] <xec> Zahlii: it expects a callback (function)
[00:36:32] <Zahlii> duh
[00:37:07] <felixjet_> http://jsfiddle.net/M6PF3/1/
[00:37:09] <Zahlii> i am a beginner :x
[00:37:29] <Tekla> yay, fellow n00b
[00:37:35] <felixjet_> but u are using this.parentNode.nextElementSibling
[00:37:39] <felixjet_> not parent().next()
[00:37:46] <felixjet_> is the same exactly?
[00:37:53] <xec> no, it's not
[00:38:03] <Cork> felixjet_: http://jsfiddle.net/M6PF3/2/ works fine here
[00:38:17] <Cork> felixjet_: it is the same thing, just less jquery classes
[00:38:24] <Cork> so a tiny bit more efficient
[00:38:27] <Zahlii> http://jsfiddle.net/J2b5F/2/ it works now, but is there an easier way to manage the requests?
[00:38:29] <xec> felixjet_: the return value is a jquery collection
[00:38:36] <xec> ;)
[00:38:36] <felixjet_> meh, actually nvm
[00:38:41] <felixjet_> i know what the problem is u.u
[00:38:45] <felixjet_> sorry
[00:39:00] <felixjet_> im using a jquery checkbox replacement, and it uses another markup after loaded
[00:39:21] <xec> :D
[00:39:53] <Cork> for checkboxes?
[00:39:55] <Cork> why?
[00:40:01] <Cork> you can do that just find with css
[00:40:21] <xec> Zahlii: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8049041
[00:41:06] <felixjet_> css ones doesnt look good
[00:41:16] <Cork> what?
[00:41:17] <felixjet_> you have to use a background and position it
[00:41:29] <Cork> not really
[00:41:45] <Cork> you can just hide the checkbox element and do what ever you like in a lable
[00:41:51] <Cork> *label
[00:41:59] <felixjet_> yea, thats what i had at first
[00:42:03] <felixjet_> i hide the checkbox
[00:42:10] <felixjet_> add a padding-left to the label
[00:42:20] <felixjet_> and set a background
[00:42:26] <felixjet_> that appears in the padded area
[00:42:30] <Cork> if you want text just set it in a separate label
[00:42:33] <felixjet_> the problem is that is not compatible with 2 line labels
[00:42:42] <Cork> sure it is
[00:42:53] <Cork> just use vertical-align: middle
[00:43:14] <Cork> or what ever you want to align it with
[00:43:20] <felixjet_> is not about align...
[00:43:34] <felixjet_> its about the padding area will be clickable
[00:43:39] <felixjet_> even if nothing is there
[00:43:39] <Cork> felixjet_: i think your missing the point of not doing it all in one label
[00:43:54] <felixjet_> what do you mean?
[00:43:57] <Cork> if you do that; then yes you will have sticky situations
[00:43:59] <felixjet_> <label><input></label> ?
[00:44:14] <xec> Zahlii: http://jsfiddle.net/J2b5F/3/
[00:44:18] <Cork> <input type="checkbox" id="a"><label for="a"></label> <label for="a">Click here</label>
[00:44:36] <felixjet_> 2 labels..?
[00:44:37] <Cork> <input type="checkbox" id="a"><label for="a" class="themed-checkbox"></label> <label for="a">Click here</label>
[00:44:39] <Cork> yes
[00:44:45] <felixjet_> is that valid?
[00:44:47] <Cork> yes
[00:44:50] <felixjet_> :/
[00:45:03] <Cork> there is a reason it's this.labels and not this.label :)
[00:45:11] <xec> Zahlii: $.ajax() already returns a promise
[00:45:37] <felixjet_> and how i do change the themed-checkbox
[00:45:47] <felixjet_> based on the input state
[00:45:47] <fabioportieri> \o/
[00:45:50] <Cork> :checked + label
[00:46:24] <felixjet_> but what if the text of label contains 2 lines
[00:46:42] <felixjet_> the text would go below the themed checkbox
[00:46:50] <Cork> well if you want to support that it is possible
[00:46:55] <Cork> i just tend to forbid it
[00:47:22] <felixjet_> i mean, its even possible to fix that?
[00:47:25] <Cork> :checked + .themed-checkbox, :checked + * + .themed-checkbox
[00:47:27] <felixjet_> with a css one
[00:47:29] <Cork> yes
[00:48:12] <Cork> it all about constructing the css selectors
[00:48:18] <Cork> and it isn't very hard
[00:48:25] <Cork> and the up side is it works without even needing js
[00:49:16] <ravenzz> keep in mind that the :checked pseudo class is not supported by IE8
[00:49:55] <Cork> but you can handle that with a js shim
[00:50:04] <Cork> there are loads of them out there
[00:50:04] <ravenzz> yep
[00:50:19] <ravenzz> just saying
[00:50:29] <Cork> ya, sure not saying anything about that
[00:50:36] <xec> Zahlii: cleaned up http://jsfiddle.net/J2b5F/4/
[00:53:19] <felixjet_> http://jsfiddle.net/247t9/1/
[00:53:20] <felixjet_> but...
[00:53:28] <felixjet_> how to trigger the :checked
[00:53:32] <felixjet_> if i cant click on the checkbox
[00:53:33] <felixjet_> xD
[00:53:44] <Cork> $('input').click()
[00:53:47] <Cork> or
[00:53:55] <felixjet_> <Cork> and the up side is it works without even needing js
[00:53:58] <Cork> $('input').prop('checked', false)
[00:54:18] <Cork> felixjet_: well if you want to do it from script you need script
[00:54:31] <Cork> felixjet_: but labels click the button without the need for js
[00:54:47] <Cork> it's done by default from the browser
[00:55:41] <xec> Zahlii: also, noConflict() is a function to *free up* the use of $ -- setting its return value to $ means it basically does nothing?
[00:56:05] <felixjet_> it doesnt work :( dunno what im doing wrong
[00:56:14] <felixjet_> http://jsfiddle.net/247t9/2/
[00:56:30] <shoky> felixjet_ http://jsfiddle.net/247t9/3/
[00:56:37] <shoky> forgot the +
[00:57:00] <felixjet_> ah
[00:59:06] <Cork> felixjet_: http://jsfiddle.net/Q88PW/
[01:01:18] <felixjet_> this is what i mean Cork
[01:01:18] <felixjet_> http://jsfiddle.net/247t9/4/
[01:01:56] <Cork> why are you floating them?
[01:02:05] <Cork> of course you will get problem
[01:02:23] <Cork> use display: inline-block; if you want them on the same line
[01:02:38] <felixjet_> using ur example: http://jsfiddle.net/Q88PW/1/
[01:03:33] <Cork> ok?
[01:03:37] <Cork> what's worng therE?
[01:03:40] <Cork> *there
[01:04:05] <felixjet_> the text appear in another line
[01:04:19] <Cork> well you get the same behavior with input
[01:04:30] <Cork> if you don't want wrap use white-space: nowrap;
[01:04:35] <felixjet_> meh, sorry
[01:04:36] <felixjet_> bad example
[01:04:39] <felixjet_> http://jsfiddle.net/Q88PW/2/
[01:04:42] <felixjet_> check this one please
[01:05:02] <felixjet_> i dont want the second line below the input
[01:05:11] <felixjet_> which is what i said half hour ago
[01:05:12] <felixjet_> xD
[01:05:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Q88PW/3/
[01:05:17] <felixjet_> <felixjet_> but what if the text of label contains 2 lines
[01:05:18] <felixjet_> <felixjet_> the text would go below the themed checkbox
[01:05:32] <Tekla> pastebin.com/unvFk67V <-- i bet i do something terribly wrong cos after a ajax update of my page some handlers get triggered several times ... how do i do it right?
[01:05:43] <felixjet_> cant see a difference
[01:06:11] <Cork> the text shouldn't wrap on the same line anymore
[01:06:33] <felixjet_> ur example /3/ appears on another line :S
[01:06:38] <felixjet_> dunno if you see the same as me
[01:06:47] <felixjet_> http://grab.by/txK2
[01:08:59] <shoky> felixjet_ then where do you want the second line?
[01:09:08] <Cork> felixjet_: so http://jsfiddle.net/Q88PW/5/ ?
[01:09:34] <felixjet_> exactly like that xD
[01:09:46] <Cork> like i said, it is doable just fine with css
[01:09:57] <felixjet_> awesome
[01:10:11] <felixjet_> why do you use "+ * +" btw?
[01:10:35] <felixjet_> to select the label between input and last label ?
[01:10:51] <Cork> it is to allow input followed by the checkbox and input <something> followed by the checkbox
[01:10:58] <Cork> you said you wanted that
[01:11:06] <Cork> but ya, it prob isn't needed
[01:11:17] <Cork> (i've never needed it)
[01:11:38] <felixjet_> works the same without it
[01:12:02] <felixjet_> thanks so much!

[02:33:51] <mikker> I'm trying to get the correct document height and using jquery this works perfectly $(document).height()
[02:34:11] <mikker> But without jQuery I can't seem to make it work as well, often getting too large results
[02:34:36] <mikker> So my question is - how does jQuery get so reliable results?
[02:36:47] <mikker> According to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/dimensions.js it's whatever's the largest of some checks, but in reality I find, that I get something else out
[02:42:16] <fabioportieri> dopie: you missed the point of the link i gave you
[02:42:25] <shoky> mikker that's what it does..
[02:42:52] <fabioportieri> the point is to animate a fake property and use the step function to change the translate property via .css
[02:42:57] <mikker> It just seems like that's not what it returns :S
[02:43:03] <greengriminal> For anyone that has used ace-editor, could you shed some light on this error:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5dd5591fc2a178b99a5d. The problem occurs when I try to set the mode to javascript.

[04:01:59] <Amnesia> question, I'm trying to select a single button, how'd I achieve this?
[04:02:18] <Amnesia> $("button.save").button() selects all the buttons with the name "save"
[04:02:33] <Amnesia> but I'd like to select a button that's on the current tr
[04:04:59] <Amnesia> or it'd also be fine to select "all the buttons" that're in a td with the classname "controls"
[04:05:31] <Cork> Amnesia: $(this).closest('tr').find('button')
[04:05:45] <Cork> Amnesia: or $(this).closest('td').find('button')
[04:05:55] <Cork> Amnesia: or $(this).closest('td').find('button.save')
[04:06:19] <Cork> depends on what element you start from
[04:06:41] <Amnesia> dunno, how do I determine what element's currently selected?
[04:06:49] <Cork> currently?
[04:07:01] <Cork> in what context are you working right now?
[04:07:05] <Amnesia> from js's point of view
[04:07:09] <imjacobclark> $(this)
[04:07:14] <Amnesia> hm ok
[04:07:19] <Amnesia> that actually makes sense:p
[04:10:43] <Amnesia> Cork: isn't it possible to select button.save directly, e.g. $(this).closest('button.save') ?
[04:11:34] <Cork> Amnesia: only if it is a parent
[04:11:39] <Cork> ?mdn closest
[04:11:41] <b-ot> Cork: document.close - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.close
[04:11:43] <Amnesia> hm ok
[04:11:47] <Cork> ipps
[04:11:51] <Cork> ?api closest
[04:11:51] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:12:07] <Cork> it doens't check siblings
[04:13:57] <Amnesia> got it, ty!
[04:14:21] <Amnesia> btw, I fixed the issue from yesterday using the argument  "text: false" as a button argument
[04:14:38] <Amnesia> don't really know why it changes when the clone gets removed, but it's solved now:D
[04:16:29] <haba713> when i comment cartheader.phtml out from page.xml nothing changes. why?
[04:16:41] <haba713> sorry, wrong channel
[04:17:36] <mcnesium> is there some official way to get t-shirts with the jquery logo etc?

[04:33:37] <mcnesium> great, thx
[05:02:41] <Amirh> hi
[05:02:51] <Amirh> best way to write test case for jquery?
[05:04:36] <Cork> ?g quint
[05:04:42] <b-ot> Cork: Quint (fire apparatus) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quint_(fire_apparatus)

[05:05:02] <Cork> Amirh: ^
[05:06:09] <Amirh> thanks
[05:10:25] <Kimse-> I have a problem with buttonset/radio buttons, it will not completely set all the markup, this is my markup http://jsfiddle.net/DCPmq/ this is the markup produced: http://pastebin.com/zgbtjtYp
[05:10:26] <xec> ?g qunit
[05:10:27] <b-ot> xec: QUnit → http://qunitjs.com/
[05:10:31] <xec> :D
[05:10:56] <webfox> Where can I place a function like $(document).ready(function(){ at inside my html code?
[05:11:00] <Cork> xec: lol
[05:11:20] <Kimse-> webfox: anywhere inside a <script> tag
[05:11:29] <webfox> Kimse-: ok
[05:11:34] <Cork> webfox: but be careful with the end of the body
[05:11:42] <Kimse-> after you load jq that its
[05:11:47] <Cork> as ie isn't too happy if it is used there
[05:12:13] <Cork> so the safest solution is to only use ready if you have the script in head
[05:12:19] <webfox> Cork: so <script> tag can be out or <head>?
[05:12:25] <Cork> and always have the script tag at the end of body if it isn't in head
[05:12:31] <Cork> webfox: yes
[05:12:31] <webfox> Oh, ok.
[05:12:36] <Cork> it can be in head or in body
[05:13:12] <xec> webfox: not only allowed, but best placed at end of body - then you don't need the doc ready wrapper
[05:13:49] <xec> i didn't know IE had any issues with doc read there, though
[05:14:16] <xec> is that old ie, like ie8- ?
[05:14:53] <shoky> i think i ran into that once with ie9. not sure though
[05:15:46] <xec> ready*
[05:15:51] <Kimse-> now stop nothing that IE sux, we all know that :(
[05:16:02] <xec> what?
[05:16:11] <xec> did you mean "noting"?
[05:16:17] <Kimse-> noting*
[05:16:19] <xec> right :D
[05:16:38] <Kimse-> help me fix my problem instead
[05:16:41] <Kimse-> it's cross browser!
[05:16:42] <Kimse-> :D
[05:17:07] * xec fires up his trusty IE3
[05:18:15] <shoky> Kimse- i didn't understand the problem
[05:18:25] <Kimse-> shoky: me neither :(
[05:18:33] <Kimse-> the problem is with jqueryui/buttonset
[05:18:33] <xec> is .buttonset() part of jquery ui?
[05:18:38] <shoky> yea
[05:18:43] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/DCPmq/1/
[05:19:02] <Kimse-> thats weird
[05:19:04] <Kimse-> very weird
[05:19:13] <Kimse-> maybe there is a markup error else where on my page?
[05:19:44] <shoky> ¯\(°_o)/¯
[05:20:39] <xec> shoky: you look really confused, are you OK?
[05:21:07] <xec> have you been drinking all night again
[05:21:47] <shoky> been smokin all night. way confused
[05:23:08] <anli_> Can I insert at a certain index?
[05:23:20] <anli_> Or just by referring to the element before?
[05:23:24] <anli_> (slash after)
[05:23:38] <Cork> $().eq(index).after().before()
[05:23:39] <shoky> .eq(index).after(new_shit)
[05:23:48] <anli_> yeah
[05:24:05] <anli_> I have to do some more if the element should be inserted last then
[05:24:37] <Cork> well ya you would have to check if the index is -1
[05:24:50] <Cork> but with after it should work for everything except the first one
[05:25:15] <Kimse-> http://i.imgur.com/zOLzZRm.png
[05:25:34] <Kimse-> http://pastebin.com/MinQKECN this is the entire page markup
[05:27:21] <Kimse-> jquery/jqeuryui is loaded at 33/34, buttonset is called in scripted at line 39
[05:27:39] <Kimse-> and buttonset markup @ line 147
[05:28:02] <anli_> Hm, will after() instead after
[05:28:10] <anli_> Why is there insertAfter then?
[05:30:05] <shoky> Kimse-: no errors in console?
[05:30:09] <Kimse-> shoky: nope
[05:30:46] <Kimse-> it worked before btw
[05:32:25] <Kimse-> http://jsfiddle.net/DCPmq/2/ <--- created a jsfiddle, don't know how great it will work for you guys, when you can't load external parts
[05:33:31] <shoky> doesn't really help, works there
[05:36:40] <Kimse-> shoky: I ran the html through w3c validator
[05:36:49] <Kimse-> only gave me an error with line 12
[05:36:58] <shoky> Kimse- it's not the html
[05:37:10] <shoky> one of your includes is screwing with something
[05:37:11] <Kimse-> hmmm
[05:37:14] <Kimse-> okay
[05:37:35] <shoky> can't help much without seeing it live
[05:37:52] <annemarie`> hai guys
[05:38:34] <Kimse-> shoky: okay to pm you?
[05:39:01] <annemarie`> can someone please explain to me why a plain document with two unordered lists with each 3 li's in combination with prototype creates 300 mapped event listeners?
[05:39:13] <annemarie`> http://nopaste.info/484d9b5f3b.html
[05:39:38] <annemarie`> jquery or prototype alone works fine
[05:40:03] <annemarie`> but in combination with each other, also with noconflict setted, creates a js mess
[05:40:29] <annemarie`> some helpfull insight is appreciated :)
[05:42:46] <ravenzz> annemarie` what if you use event delegation?
[05:43:29] <annemarie`> hrmm, do you have some resources where i can read more about that?
[05:43:31] <shoky> Kimse- ye
[05:43:44] <ravenzz> ?on @ annemarie`
[05:43:48] <annemarie`> doesnt ring a bell under that  name
[05:43:55] <annemarie`> hrm k
[05:44:05] <ravenzz> read the on documentation
[05:44:47] <annemarie`> ok, i will
[05:45:12] <annemarie`> but, also with the delegation
[05:45:50] <ravenzz> have you tried to remove some of the thousand of script that you are including?
[05:46:23] <annemarie`> it looks in the code like when jquery binds its stuff in combination with prototype, that on the jquery assigned links, there are hundreds of click events from prototype
[05:46:36] <annemarie`> lemme prepare a screenshot
[05:46:46] <anli_> Still working on this insert at index thing, whats wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/ZcPiPyZ1
[05:46:55] <ravenzz> annemarie` I can't debug screenshots
[05:47:34] <annemarie`> screenshot show output of chrome plugin visual-event on the jquery assigned elements
[05:47:47] <annemarie`> used is the pastebin source
[05:48:07] <annemarie`> ravenzz: i have limited it to core prototype and jquery code
[05:48:11] <annemarie`> same issue
[05:48:36] <annemarie`> https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpm06jlw4f56mlt/Bildschirmfoto%202014-01-15%20um%2014.46.44.png
[05:49:12] <annemarie`> why is an event subscribed by jquery, but function is defined in prototype js
[05:50:25] <darkfrog> what is a reliable way to cleanup (disconnect Ajax connections and such) before the page unloads?
[05:50:56] <darkfrog> I've tried $(window).unload(...) but that doesn't seem to be reliably called
[05:52:34] <annemarie`> ravenzz: im using this plugin https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/visual-event/pbmmieigblcbldgdokdjpioljjninaim
[05:52:44] <annemarie`> seen in the undebuggable screenshot
[05:53:35] <annemarie`> ravenzz: here, broken down to the core framework files nopaste.info/a0830e14df.html
[05:53:46] <annemarie`> issue persists
[05:54:05] <nszceta> where can I get help regarding dajaxice
[05:54:08] <nszceta> pls advz
[05:57:16] <annemarie`> broken down to a sentence, my problem is, that one jquery bind also binds everyhing with prototype too
[05:57:22] <annemarie`> i mean, wtf
[05:59:24] <dekiss> .b is clicked.                  The child that is in A gets height 200px              A is sibling of B
[05:59:36] <dekiss> how to do this?
[06:00:25] <annemarie`> b.find('a').doStuff()
[06:01:17] <cusco> annemarie`: so all b with 'a' in teh doc are bound?
[06:01:46] <annemarie`> no
[06:01:54] <cusco> er..
[06:02:29] <annemarie`> all bs got click event
[06:02:59] <annemarie`> if theres a a sibling it is processed
[06:08:34] <dekiss> annemarie` ?
[06:08:42] <dekiss> hm
[06:10:31] <joroci> anyone know that feature where you have an input element with the current link and when you click it will auto select it so you can copy it?
[06:10:46] <dekiss> please write me exmaple I am confused
[06:10:56] <joroci> me?
[06:11:04] <dekiss> annyone
[06:11:09] <dekiss> .b is clicked.                  The child that is in A gets height 200px              A is sibling of B
[06:11:46] <dekiss> I am not sure how this will do the job <annemarie`> b.find('a').doStuff()
[06:14:38] <annemarie`> then think about it
[06:14:44] <annemarie`> what else can i do
[06:14:53] <annemarie`> set up a small test html file
[06:16:44] <anli_> shoky: I like the new_shit thing :)
[06:18:10] <wa5ted> grafi: what up
[06:20:09] <aboudreault> hey, post params are always escaped before sending?
[06:20:15] <aboudreault> (string)
[06:22:15] <anli_> If parent.children().length is 10, should not parent.eq(3).length be 1?
[06:23:54] <limpc> how do carousels scroll so smoothly? I'm using .left in mine but it seems to use alot of cpu and isnt smooth
[06:30:19] <Cork> anli_: no
[06:30:32] <Cork> anli_: but parent.children().eq(3) should be
[06:32:00] <computer2000> anyone knows how to trigger a paryley.js error message with custom error message on a field?
[06:40:35] <limpc> how do carousels scroll so smoothly? I'm using .left in mine but it seems to use alot of cpu and isnt smooth. is there another method?
[06:43:09] <BillCriswell> limpc: CSS transitions when they're available.
[06:43:39] <limpc> its an infinite scroller, i dont think you can use an animate or transition?
[06:45:25] <seutje> sure u can
[06:45:28] <supamac111> good morning everyone
[06:45:29] <seutje> just swap classses
[06:46:22] <seutje> "past" "present" and "future" and have their left property change and transition, u'll just need 1 extra intermediary class that doesn't transition, to go from past to future without an animation
[06:47:07] <seutje> some people even do it without any javamascripts: http://benschwarz.github.io/gallery-css/
[06:51:06] <anli_> Cork: doh!!! :)
[06:51:09] <anli_> Thanks
[06:51:17] <anli_> How stupid
[06:51:24] <BillCriswell> seutje: How do you feel about relying on all CSS for things like that?
[06:51:45] <seutje> hwo do you feel about relying on all JS for things like that?
[06:52:02] <seutje> basically re-implementing what the browser can probably do better
[06:52:43] <seutje> I don't use this in production btw, but these things are always a careful balancing act
[06:52:57] <BillCriswell> seutje: I like to keep it spread evenly haha.
[06:53:23] <seutje> lol
[06:53:27] <seutje> evenly byte-wise?
[06:53:32] <seutje> or cycle-wise? :P
[06:53:41] <BillCriswell> Let what's good at something do that.
[06:54:07] <BillCriswell> Damn, he charges $15 for this. Good for him.
[06:54:37] <BillCriswell> Prefixed CSS: 10kb, Unprefixed: 4.5kb... Ew.
[06:55:36] <Cork> BillCriswell: well prefixes is going away (except in webkit)
[06:56:32] <BillCriswell> I can't wait. Since I started using auto prefixer it's been less annoying to me buy seeing the output still makes me sad.
[06:56:52] <Cork> BillCriswell: well the result is a mixed bag
[06:57:08] <Cork> it means they will be helled until they get stable in standards
[06:57:24] <Cork> so the prefixed versions gets replaced with nothing (the feature is not public)
[06:57:48] <Cork> so the webbrowser user will have to flip a pref or use a command line parameter to activate the feature
[06:58:02] <BillCriswell> Cork: Got it.
[06:58:05] <Cork> and there is argument to never allow it in releases
[06:58:16] <Cork> only betas and earlier
[06:58:41] <Cork> that would have been lovely for border-radius :)
[06:58:55] <Cork> support: 2012! ^^'
[06:59:52] <PatBateman> hi, how to console.log an ascii char? eg. &#9660; I get the rendered arrow up icon
[07:00:42] <Cork> PatBateman: from where are you running this?
[07:00:49] <Cork> and from where is &#9660 comming?
[07:01:16] <PatBateman> in the browser, chrome devtools, and its in a span tag
[07:01:29] <Cork> so the character is from the dom?
[07:01:35] <PatBateman> yes
[07:01:43] <Cork> then it will have been converted to unicode
[07:02:02] <PatBateman> so if I want to compare this value, how to do it?
[07:02:03] <BillCriswell> I remember the first time using border-radius. It was pretty magical.
[07:02:16] <PatBateman> eg: if( $('.cont-arrow').html() == '&#9660;' ) {
[07:02:27] <BillCriswell> PatBateman: You can try .text() ?
[07:02:29] <Cork> PatBateman: there isn't any way to entity encode in js
[07:02:33] <Cork> won't work
[07:02:37] <BillCriswell> Oh. =(
[07:02:49] <Cork> your best option is to just use the unicode character
[07:02:51] <PatBateman> I see
[07:03:29] <PatBateman> my purpose is to replace up and down icons if a div slide down or up
[07:03:40] <PatBateman> with slideToggle()
[07:03:56] <Cork> you could do something like html().charCodeAt(0)
[07:04:05] <PatBateman> trying ok thx
[07:04:51] <PatBateman> hm i get > 9660 <
[07:04:55] <PatBateman> its good for me
[07:05:02] <Cork> ya the unicode
[07:05:07] <Cork> you can't get the entity in js
[07:05:23] <PatBateman> but its enough this time for me i guess
[07:06:01] <PatBateman> working. thank you Cork
[07:06:06] <Cork> yw
[07:06:26] <PatBateman> i learn every day something new here , hehe
[07:14:50] <computer2000> anyone knows how to trigger a paryley.js error message with custom error message on a field?
[07:14:57] <computer2000> parsley.js i mean
[07:16:15] <Fraz> hi
[07:16:31] <Fraz> how do i access jquery ui features within my jquery plugin?
[07:18:21] <Fraz> nm, i had a typo:|
[07:22:00] <BillCriswell> Holy shit I can't focus today.
[07:27:02] <PatBateman> Cork, you tweet?
[07:27:54] <bberry> Hey guys. I am using jstree contextmenu plugin to set up custom contextmenu commands.  The callback function for the contextmenu items has the object as an argument. this object (which is the item that was rightclicked on) has an attributes list that i need to get the values of.... Normally i would access this group of attributes with $(obj).attr()
[07:27:54] <bberry> .each(//function), but jquery barfs, saying it cant get the nodeType of undefined or null reference when referring to $(obj).attr(). However, if i specify the attr im trying to get, like $(obj).attr('id'), i can get the value of that attribute.
[07:28:50] <bberry> am i using this incorrectly?
[07:38:28] <Fraz> in a jquery plugin, how do i access the id of the element that the widget called on?
[07:41:15] <Amnesia> question, I've got the following code: https://privatepaste.com/8185910549
[07:41:24] <Amnesia> and the cloning part's working fine now
[07:41:45] <Velveeta> fraz: this.attr('id')
[07:41:46] <Amnesia> but for some reason the "save" button isn't working submitting the form
[07:41:52] <Amnesia> in the cloned row
[07:42:02] <Amnesia> the others are actually working..
[07:43:33] <Velveeta> amnesia: you're binding the click event before the button actually exists, you need to look into event delegation to bind events for future elements
[07:44:18] <Amnesia> Velveeta: the click event's just there to add a row
[07:44:22] <Amnesia> and remove it
[07:45:13] <Velveeta> gotcha, i'm not sure how to read most of that… which word means save?
[07:45:20] <Amnesia> sec
[07:45:22] <Velveeta> opslaan
[07:45:23] <Velveeta> ?
[07:46:18] <Amnesia> https://privatepaste.com/7a140cd82b
[07:46:18] <Amnesia> yep
[07:46:57] <Velveeta> so i'm not familiar w/ the search function you're trying to use there, or the 'clone' string you're passing to it, on line 3.. what's the intent you're trying to do with that expression?
[07:47:16] <Amnesia> check whether a row is a clone
[07:47:44] <Amnesia> the if statements checks whether rowID contains the string "clone"
[07:48:54] <Velveeta> what version of jquery are you running? or is 'search' a plugin you wrote?
[07:49:03] <Velveeta> because it's not a jquery function that i've ever seen
[07:49:17] <Amnesia> 1.5
[07:49:31] <Amnesia> think it's a javascript function
[07:49:50] <BillCriswell> location.search is the closest thing I can think of?
[07:50:16] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search Well.
[07:50:39] <Velveeta> oh i didn't read line 2 properly
[07:50:51] <Velveeta> i thought he had a handle to the element, not the id of it
[07:51:17] <Amnesia> are you shocked of the nastiness of this code;P?
[07:53:39] <Velveeta> heheheh
[07:53:54] <Amnesia> basically my goal is to do the following:
[07:54:14] <Amnesia> clone a tr, remove a clone, save a clone
[07:54:18] <Amnesia> and the latter's not working
[07:54:26] <bberry> Velveeta: i presume $(obj).attr().each(//function) is appropriate syntax, correct?
[07:55:47] <darkfrog> I'm trying to connect two hidden dialogs with jQuery UI.  Either one works separately, but when I try to allocate them both the second one doesn't work....anyone seen something like this before?
[07:56:05] <darkfrog> and yes, they have different ids
[07:56:08] <Velveeta> bberry: i don't think attr() will return the list of attributes if you pass no parameters, try something like this instead: $($(obj)[0].attributes).each(function)
[07:56:25] <bberry> Velveeta: okie doke. ill try it.
[07:56:26] <Velveeta> amnesia: this'll be a lot easier to help you debug if you can throw together a working demo on jsfiddle or jsbin
[07:56:57] <Velveeta> darkfrog: do you mean having a dialog on top of a dialog, or nested in a dialog, or what exactly do you mean by "connect" ?
[07:56:59] <remysharp> but probably easier in jsbin, you know, just because :)
[07:57:15] <Amnesia> Velveeta: I'll make one this evening, g2g now:/
[07:57:21] <Amnesia> ty for your help so far though:)!
[07:57:23] <Velveeta> ok
[07:57:36] <Amnesia> do note that there's also php code involved
[07:57:49] <Velveeta> well, there shouldn't be in your example
[07:57:50] <Amnesia> but currently the problem is, that it doesn't even reach that code yet
[07:57:54] <Amnesia> nope
[07:57:56] <darkfrog> Velveeta: just two separate dialogs that are both invisible until 'open'
[07:57:59] <Velveeta> you just need to show us the rendered html and the js that's trying to interact with it
[07:58:05] <Amnesia> try for your help so far!
[07:58:11] <Amnesia> ty*
[07:58:32] <Velveeta> darkfrog: so you just want to open 2 dialogs… at the same time?
[07:58:33] <darkfrog> when I try to 'open' the second one it says that I'm trying to open it before it's initialized....but I am executing the code to initialize it
[07:58:53] <darkfrog> Velveeta: no, just initialized and based on user interaction one or the other will be shown
[07:59:15] <Velveeta> i'm gonna need to see a demo of what your code looks like
[07:59:25] <Fraz> <Velveeta> fraz: this.attr('id') << i already tried this, i get this.attr is not a function
[07:59:47] <Fraz> and $(this).attr('id') returns undefined
[07:59:47] <darkfrog> Velveeta: easier said than done I'm afraid
[08:00:04] <Velveeta> fraz: did you try this.id ? you mentioned both 'plugin' and 'widget'… are you writing a plugin that directly lives in the $.fn namespace, or a widget using the ui widget factory?
[08:00:59] <Fraz> Velveeta, the widget factory
[08:01:11] <Velveeta> darkfrog: just throw together some sample markup for your hidden dialogs, and a simplified snippet of your js that activates them
[08:01:16] <Velveeta> fraz: this.element.attr('id')
[08:01:22] <Fraz> aha, thanks
[08:01:26] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[08:07:30] <bberry> Velveeta: Lol. if i do $($(obj)[0].attributes).each(function (e, i, a) { console.log(e) }); then the output is literally "0,1,2,3"
[08:08:03] <bberry> i would expect them to be objects, not strings haha
[08:08:35] <Velveeta> that's because each doesn't provide an event
[08:08:44] <bberry> e for element
[08:08:50] <Velveeta> you need to just receive i and a, and i is the index, a is the attribute
[08:08:57] <Velveeta> the attributes array isn't a list of elements
[08:09:09] <bberry> oh lol.
[08:09:23] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you want $.each( $(obj)[0].attributes, function( index, element ) { });
[08:09:30] <bberry> aight, ill try that out
[08:09:42] <Velveeta> index will be the attribute key, element would be the value, in the above function signature
[08:09:55] <bberry> i'm used to doing like forEach on arrays of objects >.<
[08:10:03] <BillCriswell> I never used .attributes.
[08:10:06] <bberry> gotcha
[08:10:32] <Velveeta> yeah the proper way to reference that would probably be through element.getAttributes()
[08:11:02] <joroci> anyone know that feature where you have an input element with the current link and when you click it will auto select it so you can copy it?
[08:13:32] <bberry> Velveeta, BillCriswell: Yep, that worked.  Unfortunately, IE orders the attributes list in a different order than in chrome.
[08:13:55] <BillCriswell> Can't rely on objects for order.
[08:14:12] <Velveeta> rightio
[08:14:30] <joroci> anyone?:)
[08:14:34] <bberry> Yeah... hadda learn the hard way haha >.< now im relying on the attribute name
[08:14:59] <Velveeta> joroci: are you talking about something like what bit.ly does, to click a button to automatically copy the text element's contents to your clipboard?
[08:15:24] <andy_wfc> What's proper protocol for reporting browser-specific bugs - i.e., stuff that can't be demonstrated via jsfiddle?
[08:16:11] <Velveeta> well, i would imagine you'd just submit a ticket to the jquery team, but if it's browser specific, could you just whip up a fiddle and tell us what browser to view it in?
[08:16:22] <joroci> Velveeta: yea, you click on the link and it will auto select so you can ctrl+c
[08:16:32] <andy_wfc> as near as i can tell, fiddle has it's own js engine
[08:16:58] <Velveeta> fiddle just executes in the js runtime of the browser that's viewing it, it just stores your code in an iframe page
[08:17:26] <andy_wfc> ok, then i'm staring at an even weirder bug in something
[08:17:43] <joroci> how can i select text like that?
[08:19:49] <Velveeta> you can try the jquery select() function
[08:19:59] <Velveeta> $(yourInput).select() on click of your button
[08:19:59] <joroci> it's not on input only?
[08:20:15] <Velveeta> what kind of element is this that you're trying to highlight the text of?
[08:20:27] <Velveeta> because you originally said input...
[08:20:48] <joroci> yea, i guess it just looked like input
[08:20:55] <mklappstuhl> <div><a>test1</a><a class='clickthis'>test2</a></div> — how would I make any click on the div or its children actually click on $('.clickthis')
[08:21:12] <joroci> i want to select a text of a button
[08:21:16] <mklappstuhl> experimented with delegate but that caused an infinite loop
[08:22:04] <Fraz> does anyone know if its possible to fastforward/rewind through css keyframes?
[08:22:17] <Velveeta> mklappstuhl: use delegate like you previously did, but do an event.stopPropagation() inside your click handler
[08:22:35] <Velveeta> joroci: in that case, i don't know that you can do that via js...
[08:23:02] <joroci> bit.ly is doing it
[08:24:38] <BillCriswell> It's selecting the text of a button?
[08:25:14] <joroci> not a button , a
[08:25:28] <joroci> a tag
[08:25:49] <BillCriswell> So they click the button and it "Selects" an a tag?
[08:25:57] <joroci> the text yea
[08:26:19] <joroci> lol
[08:26:20] <joroci> no
[08:26:25] <joroci> they "a" tag
[08:26:38] <joroci> you click on it and it will select the href of that "a" tag
[08:27:01] <BillCriswell> You mean copy it to the clipboard?
[08:27:06] <joroci> no
[08:27:20] <BillCriswell> I don't know how you're seeing the href of an element getting selected.
[08:27:21] <prtksxna> Fraz: animationPlayState might help
[08:27:34] <prtksxna> Fraz: Read this post - http://css-tricks.com/controlling-css-animations-transitions-javascript/
[08:27:37] <joroci> go to bit.ly
[08:27:39] <joroci> add a link
[08:28:11] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:28:12] <prtksxna> Fraz: Could also check out http://labs.bigroomstudios.com/libraries/animo-js
[08:28:27] <Velveeta> the thing is… bit.ly uses a text input
[08:28:40] <joroci> if you click the short url it will highlight the text
[08:28:59] <mklappstuhl> Velveeta: $('div').delegate('*', 'click', function (e) { // 1. click goal // 2. stop propagaation })
[08:29:04] <BillCriswell> joroci: So... http://jsbin.com/EfOKuSE/2/edit ?
[08:29:11] <mklappstuhl> Velveeta: is still sending me into an infinite loop
[08:29:29] <Velveeta> mklappstuhl: whip up a jsfiddle demo and i'll see if i can figure out what's going on
[08:29:54] <joroci> Velveeta what text input?
[08:30:12] <BillCriswell> The one on the page when you submit the url.
[08:30:21] <BillCriswell> with the Copy button next to it.
[08:30:38] <Velveeta> when you enter a url and it shortens it, it uses a text input
[08:30:58] <joroci> ok after the url is shorten you have a copy button and to the left you see the short link
[08:30:59] <joroci> click it
[08:31:17] <joroci> it will highlight the text
[08:31:38] <Velveeta> yeah, but it does that *in a text input*… it's easy to do in a text input
[08:31:46] <Velveeta> you said you needed to do it with an anchor tag though
[08:32:22] <BillCriswell> It's just floating a copy of the text away here. It's selected as soon as a page loads. You can just do $(el).focus() to select an input / textarea element.
[08:32:59] <Velveeta> yeah the 'copy' button just copies it to the clipboard, and probably uses a flash app to do that
[08:33:07] <BillCriswell> joroci: http://jsbin.com/EfOKuSE/2/edit
[08:33:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah, sucks there isn't a reliable way to do it without flash.
[08:34:00] <Velveeta> right
[08:34:08] <joroci> are you talking about the text near the X number of clics?
[08:34:09] <joroci> clicks
[08:34:52] <Velveeta> oh now i see what you're saying
[08:37:40] <BillCriswell> What does that have to do with selecting any text though?
[08:38:08] <Velveeta> if you click on the link text to the left of "N clicks", it auto-highlights
[08:38:15] <Velveeta> i'm digging into the page to see how they're doing it
[08:38:54] <BillCriswell> I don't understand what the issue is.
[08:39:57] <Velveeta> he wants the same behavior in his page
[08:40:40] <grafi> behave
[08:40:46] <grafi> people
[08:45:55] <BillCriswell> Whatever this is, it seems overl complicated.
[08:46:02] <Johan> hi
[08:46:09] <Velveeta> ok, so i just dredged through the bit.ly code, and they're using a method of creationg a new selection range and manually highlighting text with it
[08:46:18] <Johan> may i ask some help?
[08:46:23] <BillCriswell> Why wouldn't they just make it an <input> with a transparent background?
[08:46:25] <Velveeta> it really is a big pain in the ass kind of method, but i can probably dig you up a link to a tutorial or something
[08:46:31] <Velveeta> billcriswell: no clue
[08:47:22] <joroci>  because input can be changed
[08:47:26] <BillCriswell> I guess cause they want to be able to hide the protocol?
[08:47:33] <BillCriswell> joroci: so can an <a> tag.
[08:47:34] <Velveeta> here's one: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/292159/Javascript-code-to-get-selected-text and here's another: http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/JavaScript-DOM-Ranges.id-292301.html
[08:47:49] <Velveeta> johan: just ask, you don't have to ask if you can ask :)
[08:48:24] <Velveeta> joroci: when you see what a pain in the ass it is to implement in a cross-browser fashion, you may just say "why wouldn't they just make it an <input> with a transparent background?"
[08:48:35] <joroci> thanks Velveeta,BillCriswell
[08:48:44] <Velveeta> no problemo
[08:48:57] <joroci> how can i disable the text change?
[08:49:14] <joroci> if i disable the input you can't highlight the text
[08:49:28] <Guest51280> how to displaying all values from checked checkbox at same time?
[08:49:37] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/aNerakUM/1/ joroci
[08:50:06] <BillCriswell> I think they just use that complicated ass way just to hide the protocol.
[08:50:45] <joroci> BillCriswell i don't want the user to change the text
[08:51:15] <BillCriswell> joroci: readonly
[08:52:26] <joroci> :) thanks
[08:52:26] <BillCriswell> joroci: http://jsbin.com/aNerakUM/2/ very rough, but you can make it snazzy.
[08:53:13] <joroci> that should do it
[08:53:56] <BillCriswell> I love adjacent selectors.
[08:56:24] <Velveeta> i love expletives
[08:56:53] <grafi> i love me
[08:57:22] <BillCriswell> I love lamp.
[08:57:37] <Velveeta> you're not dead, brick!
[08:57:48] <Es0teric> lol Velveeta
[09:00:23] <BillCriswell> I still haven't seen the second one. I don't know what's taking me so long.
[09:00:38] <BillCriswell> It can't possibly match my expectations, but I'm OK with that.
[09:01:41] <Velveeta> i haven't seen it either
[09:01:46] <duch_kazatel> goooood morning folks
[09:02:02] <Velveeta> i've heard meh reviews, that it was a decent movie, but not as good as the first
[09:04:14] <ericx2x> how do i keep track of the value the user typed into an input field to later be used for google analytics event tracking?
[09:04:45] <Velveeta> that's not really a jquery question
[09:04:48] <ericx2x> I have a google analytics line that looks like this:  _gaq.push(_trackEvent(“ZipLookUp”, “LookUp”, “Found or Not Found”, “ZipCodeEntered”));
[09:05:29] <ericx2x> i need to get the ZipCodeEntered spot to be the input the user typed into an input field
[09:07:02] <Velveeta> $(inputSelector).val() ?
[09:09:21] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Yeah. Those are the exact reviews I Was expecting. There's just really no way to compete with the first. It has too long to become legandary.
[09:10:40] <Velveeta> they should've splashed some black panther musk on it.. 60% of the time, it works every time..
[09:24:43] <BillCriswell> joroci, Velveeta: Ha, protocol hidden: http://jsbin.com/aNerakUM/3/edit?html,css,js,output
[09:25:27] <Velveeta> heheh, i suppose that works for that specific font and font-sizing :D
[09:25:42] <BillCriswell> Aww yeah.
[09:26:21] <Velveeta> you can use -3.3em and might be able to get a more font-size friendly result
[09:26:48] <Velveeta> *mostly* works as i zoom in andout
[09:28:23] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I was just doing it dirty haha.
[09:28:49] <Velveeta> heheheh
[09:31:34] <BillCriswell> Damn, it messes with the highlighting actually.
[09:31:52] <BillCriswell> That's very interesting.
[09:32:21] <BillCriswell> It doesn't select properly either. I wonder if that's a bug.
[09:32:55] <BillCriswell> Oh wait.. maybe my browser was being weird.
[09:33:36] <BillCriswell> or jsbin haha.
[09:36:05] <BillCriswell> Ah, if you click the input it messes with the range that's chosen. There's so much to learn about browsers in general.
[09:36:21] <duch_kazatel> web browsers are funky.
[09:37:00] <duch_kazatel> eventually you’ll learn where the consistencies and inconcistencies lie.
[09:37:02] <Velveeta> we should all go back to aol browser
[09:37:10] <Velveeta> aol *is* the internet.. according to aol
[09:37:17] <duch_kazatel> you mean IE ;)
[09:37:57] <friedbyte> I'm trying to use .html() to display the width of several divs with different widths. I set a var to get the width of the div class, but it is outputting width of first div on all the divs. Any suggestions how to get the width of divs that have different widths?
[09:38:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm willing to bet this behavoir is consistent, I just never payed enough attention to notice.
[09:38:10] <bberry> i remember back in the day i used to hate netscape for everything that it was... now that i know javascripts' history, im less hateful.
[09:38:27] <VectorX> in a <form> <button> </form>   for the button click event how cant i reference the parent form object ?
[09:38:36] <Velveeta> friedbyte: show us a jsfiddle/jsbin demo
[09:38:38] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: $('div').eq(index).width(); vs $('div').width() I'm assuming?
[09:39:08] <Velveeta> vectorx: $(this).closest('form')
[09:39:11] <BillCriswell> VectorX: .closest('form') might be the safest bet
[09:39:17] <Velveeta> high-five
[09:39:22] <VectorX> ty
[09:39:24] <BillCriswell> uhn tisss
[09:39:29] <VectorX> why not use parent though
[09:39:42] <Velveeta> because what if you nest it deeper than that
[09:40:03] <BillCriswell> VectorX: Just a precaution mostly. You could use parent() if you want with that exact html.
[09:40:19] <VectorX> ok
[09:40:22] <Velveeta> but if that's the case, why ask the question in the first place if you were aware of .parent() ? :D
[09:40:26] <VectorX> yes i see the point now
[09:40:44] <BillCriswell> Velveeta brings up an eggcelent question.
[09:41:04] * Velveeta drums his fingertips together and mutters "excellent"
[09:41:18] <Velveeta> smithers! …answer my questions for me
[09:41:27] <VectorX> Velveeta i dont use jquery much so it was syntactical
[09:41:33] <Velveeta> gotcha
[09:41:39] <friedbyte> BillCriswell: your tip was what I was hoping to find, thanks!
[09:41:48] <BillCriswell> I haven't watched Simpsons in far too long.
[09:41:54] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: Awesome.
[09:42:42] <BillCriswell>  $('div').each(function(){ $('.widths').append( $(this).width() + 'pixelz ' ); }); could also work
[09:43:10] <Velveeta> it probably won't though.. unless your browser is leet enough to understand 'pixelz' as a measurement :D
[09:43:21] <Velveeta> sorry, |33+
[09:43:34] <BillCriswell> It's just outputting a string though.
[09:43:45] <Velveeta> oh yeah good point
[09:43:48] <Velveeta> in that case, carry on!
[09:45:25] <BillCriswell> This is how I feel with the CSS I'm working on right now: http://bukk.it/alsohowiwritejavascripts.gif
[09:51:00] <duch_kazatel> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif
[09:52:33] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Hahaha.
[09:53:21] <BillCriswell> I know CSS very well, but keeping it organized is touch when there's media queries involved ( in my opinion ).
[09:53:30] <duch_kazatel> and also: https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRHXhrQX3iU9jwP5GtXTziqzDMB8YQt2_8PSdoJpH1qPIiKhwhAUw
[09:53:49] <Velveeta> billcriswell: i love that gif :D
[09:54:06] <duch_kazatel> but yeah, CSS organization is a massive PITA unless you use SASS or LESS.
[09:54:07] <Velveeta> annnnnnd the first one duch_kazatel posted :D
[09:54:28] <Velveeta> i think the family guy one is my favorite though, when it comes to css descriptions
[09:55:02] <krastavac> can i get specific div height on window resize event, but div height, not window height?
[09:55:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm even having issues with Sass. I can't decide if I should keep my media questions inside the elements or keep them outside.
[09:55:50] <Velveeta> sure, but you have to reference the div, and not 'this'
[09:56:21] <duch_kazatel> krastavac you sure can.  $(window).on(‘resize’, function(){$(‘div’).height()});
[09:56:22] <BillCriswell> media queries.
[09:56:25] <BillCriswell> lol media questions.
[09:56:32] <krastavac> ok
[09:57:02] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell ah - we’re spinning up a separate app for mobile/tablet.
[09:57:41] <duch_kazatel> so we’re sidestepping most of those problems.
[09:59:01] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Understood.
[10:00:30] <BillCriswell> Keeping the media queries in the selectors keep it dry, but I think it's just harder to read.
[10:01:37] <duch_kazatel> it can be.
[10:02:33] <Velveeta> one of our devs that sent out separate assets for mobile/tablet/desktop just had a core set of assets that they all used, and the interface-specific stuff in their respective assets
[10:02:43] <Velveeta> so there was a core.css and a desktop.css that laid on top of it, etc
[10:03:17] <Velveeta> helps to keep things dry while allowing for totally different layotus and interactions per device type, without loading the overhead of everything for all
[10:03:35] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that makes sense.
[10:04:01] <Velveeta> and of course works best with restful apis
[10:04:08] <Velveeta> but that's a whole other topic of conversation
[10:04:50] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I like that approach from afar, but when you're using it it's like "What style was this on tablet? *open tablet.css* oh ok, *back to desktop*"
[10:05:39] <Velveeta> yeah it definitely helps when you're not making context switches like that too often :D
[10:05:49] <PBJ_> Does anyone know if the Jquery Mobile 1.4 release resolves the Safari fixed position issue for headers? I have an app in 1.3.2 and am considering upgrading.
[10:06:32] <BillCriswell> I like being able to have a "module" and having like "header.scss" with .header { color: red; @media ( min-width: 400px ){ color: blue; }} but it just begins to suck when you need to style children.
[10:06:36] <Velveeta> depending on what mobile OS's you're supporting, you might be able to get away with position: sticky instead, it works well enough in IOS 6+
[10:07:15] <PBJ_> I am target iphone 4 on ios 6.1.3
[10:07:37] <Velveeta> pbj_: try position sticky and see if it works any better
[10:08:08] <PBJ_> I will, thanks, but have you tried 1.4 headers by any chance?
[10:08:26] <Velveeta> i don't use jqmobile myself
[10:08:37] <PBJ_> ok thx
[10:11:48] <Schalla> Hello folks. I got a question out of curiousity, why does parent() expects a attr?
[10:11:58] <Schalla> *param
[10:12:03] <duch_kazatel> Schalla wat.
[10:12:08] <duch_kazatel> Schalla clarify your question.
[10:12:21] <Schalla> $("#test").parent(); my IDE tells my, that parent would require at least one param.
[10:12:35] <limpc> $(scrollerContent[scrollSwitch]).animate({scrollLeft: "-=" + Math.abs(scrollerPosition)});  // this should animate an element scrollerPosition pixels to the left, yes?
[10:12:46] <BillCriswell> Schalla: It should say it's optional, for if ou only want a certain parent.
[10:12:55] <duch_kazatel> ugh IDEs.
[10:13:03] <duch_kazatel> Schalla - http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[10:13:05] <Schalla> Ay, alright. Thanks for comfirming that.
[10:13:13] <duch_kazatel> the official documentation says the selector says it’s optional.
[10:13:30] <Velveeta> yeah, it's optional, your ide probably just sees that it accepts a param, and assumes it's required
[10:13:50] <limpc> just pass null or false for the param
[10:14:08] <Schalla> Well it doesn't bother if I keep it blank I guess?
[10:14:11] <shoky> no, don't do that
[10:14:18] <Schalla> blank should be as default treated as null, hm?
[10:14:25] <Velveeta> treated as undefined
[10:14:34] <BillCriswell> Schalla: http://jsbin.com/AFUwOda/1/edit?html,js,output is about the only time I can see it as useful.
[10:14:57] <Schalla> Ah, well. True.
[10:15:22] <limpc> this should animate an element scrollerPosition pixels to the left, yes?  $(obj).animate({scrollLeft: "-=" + Math.abs(scrollerPosition)});
[10:15:28] <Schalla> Thanks fort eh info and have a nice evening. :)
[10:15:43] <BillCriswell> Word.
[10:16:23] <BillCriswell> limpc: What is scrollerPosition?
[10:16:23] <duch_kazatel> deffo - the docs are your friend!
[10:16:28] <limpc> an integer
[10:16:43] <BillCriswell> Is it 0 though?
[10:16:56] <limpc> no, its an incrementing number from 1
[10:17:31] <Velveeta> your animate function call should just be passing the value you want to animate *to*
[10:18:10] <Velveeta> you can optionally provide a step function for it to execute each tick, to manually set values each increment, but for most things, it's not necessary
[10:18:18] <limpc> im trying to create a smooth scrolling effect for an infinite carousel plugin. it currently uses $(obj).style.left = -negativenumber. it works, but its horrendously choppy
[10:18:21] <BillCriswell> I think you'd also want a position number to scrollLEft.
[10:18:41] <BillCriswell> limpc: .left is a lot different from scrollLeft
[10:18:49] <limpc> BillCriswell, right
[10:19:08] <BillCriswell> want a positive*
[10:19:17] <limpc> it is a positive number
[10:19:43] <limpc> Math.abs()
[10:20:20] <BillCriswell> limpc: You're doing -= though.
[10:20:44] <limpc> yeah, i was hoping that would work
[10:20:48] <Velveeta> if it's a fixed position you're moving to, you could also just do it through a css transition, and it'd be smoother than a js animation
[10:21:30] <limpc> Velveeta, its an infinite carousel with 2 UL elements being pushed to the left.
[10:21:48] <Velveeta> ahh yes
[10:22:22] <limpc> so is .left my only opinion? its not very attractive
[10:22:46] <Velveeta> you can try a translate3d hack and hope it smooths it out some
[10:23:39] <limpc> its still pixels though, how does stuff like scrollLeft achieve such smooth scrolling?
[10:24:17] <Velveeta> are you talking about how does native browser scrolling achieve such smooth scrolling?
[10:24:44] <limpc> is scrollLeft a native browser call? I thought it was jquery
[10:25:13] <Velveeta> scrollLeft is a jquery function, but it doesn't animate the scroll
[10:25:21] <Velveeta> it just sets the scroll offset on the x axis
[10:25:30] <limpc> ah
[10:25:31] <Velveeta> it jumps directly to that position, so there's nothing smooth about it
[10:25:37] <BillCriswell> scrollLeft is availble in plain Javascript. el.scrollLeft
[10:25:47] <limpc> yeah i googled and noticed that
[10:26:23] <Velveeta> if you want to animate a position being shifted, you should do it either with css transitions when you can, or by using css translate functions, preferably translate3d w/ a 0 z-axis
[10:26:48] <Velveeta> using the translate3d function will offload that operation to the system's gpu, which is great at just shifting pixels around, and will help smooth out the animation
[10:27:35] <limpc> Velveeta, thanks will check into that.
[10:27:40] <Velveeta> here are a couple of blogs posts and a video about that whole branch of front end stuff: http://css-tricks.com/tale-of-animation-performance/ .. http://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/
[10:28:05] <Velveeta> from 2 of the best resources on the web
[10:28:58] <limpc> thanks!
[10:29:07] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[10:32:02] <DelphiWorld> yo jqueryists
[10:32:10] <duch_kazatel> whuddup gangsta
[10:32:13] <DelphiWorld> anyone recomand *ANY* digital clock plugin?
[10:32:37] <Velveeta> btw, if anybody has an interest in angularjs, they're streaming the ngconf live on ng-conf.org throughout the conference for the next couple days
[10:33:01] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld make your own! :D
[10:33:09] <Velveeta> i'm not particularly interested in using it myself, despite my love for google, but i do so enjoy seeing different features and implementation details of a variety of frameworks to help improve my own code
[10:33:47] <BillCriswell> I wish I had the time to invest into angular. I think I got the basics but figuring out what the hell drupal is doing is eating up most my time recently.
[10:33:58] <Velveeta> oh you poor bastard
[10:34:16] <duch_kazatel> i prefer moot’s riot.js partially because it’s so much more simple.
[10:34:46] <duch_kazatel> three API methods/.
[10:35:20] <Velveeta> i'm a huge fan of vapor.js
[10:35:33] <Spami> Hello
[10:35:34] <Velveeta> they were one of the first to add support for IE11 also, while maintaining full backward compatibility
[10:36:03] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaahahahahaha
[10:36:10] <Spami> For some reason, firefox trigger 2 times the same .on method in my file and I can't figure out why
[10:36:24] <duch_kazatel> Spami which version of .on() are you using?
[10:37:05] <Spami> duch_kazatel, something like this: $('.gallery').on('project', function(e, images, garbage) {
[10:37:27] <duch_kazatel> so it’s a custom event?  then that event is getting triggered twice on that class.
[10:37:40] <duch_kazatel> you could always console.log($(this)); inside that handler and see what’s up.
[10:37:48] <Velveeta> i might have to play w/ riot some
[10:37:50] <duch_kazatel> or use a debugger.
[10:37:54] <Spami> duch_kazatel, yes but it only happen in firefox
[10:38:17] <duch_kazatel> see above comments :)
[10:39:51] <limpc> Velveeta, that works perfectly and is MUCH better
[10:40:05] <Velveeta> good to hear :)
[10:41:12] <limpc> Velveeta, its still buggy, but here it is: http://r.profferlabs.com/s4/
[10:41:50] <Velveeta> that's crazy choppy on my machine
[10:42:00] <limpc> really. its smooth here
[10:42:11] <limpc> what browser and version?
[10:42:21] <Velveeta> chrome, edge version, on a mac
[10:42:25] <Velveeta> w/ 16 gigs of ram
[10:42:44] <limpc> weird. ill check another machine
[10:45:11] <limpc> works fine on a mac pro
[10:45:17] <rainabba> I need to hide logical columns in a table and can't use display on <col> elements the way I used to be able to (not supported apparently in modern browsers). I can use classes on individual <td> but then I need to also maintain spanned columns and am finding that tricky. Any suggestions? Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=zpvE8IQATO
[10:46:43] <Velveeta> limpc: yeah, i'm looking at my frame rate in dev tools, and it's reading between 30 and 60, fluctuating, so it shouldn't be anywhere near as choppy as what i'm seeing
[10:47:57] <Velveeta> just bottomed out at 10 though, and is stuck there
[10:48:23] <rainabba> Velveeta: Familiar with jankfree.org?
[10:48:42] <Velveeta> ok, looks like if i shrink my window up to about 25% of its size, it smoths out a bit… i'm on a 27" monitor, so i don't know if that has something to do with it
[10:48:50] <Velveeta> rainabba: nope, but i'll take a look
[10:49:17] <Velveeta> weird, now that i re-maximize it, it's still smooth
[10:49:35] <Velveeta> rainabba: ahhh very nice
[10:49:36] <rainabba> Velveeta: They specifically look at scrolling and rendering issues. Seen a few talks at IO and Chrome Dev Summit. good stuff. Seen the option in DevTools to highlight potential scrolling bottlenecks?
[10:49:50] <Velveeta> yepyep
[10:50:10] <Velveeta> and i watched paul irish give a really good presentation at #perfmatters a few months ago about it also
[10:50:23] <rainabba> :)
[10:50:38] <Velveeta> i think paul lewis was presenting on a similar topic, but more from the perspective of the nuts and bolts of the browser
[10:51:50] <Velveeta> when i flip on paint rectangles for this particular carousel, i see zero of them.. beautiful :D
[10:53:06] <limpc> where is that option at?
[11:00:34] <rainabba> limpc: Cog at the top-right of devtools, then check the "Show 'Rendering' view in console drawer" option then you'll see a new tab in the drawer titled "Rendering". There's where you'll find those options.
[11:04:45] <limpc> ah cool ty rainabba. didnt know about that
[11:05:29] <rainabba> np
[11:08:49] <hlve> hi guys.
[11:10:22] <bberry> does this channel have an ecmabot equivalent?
[11:10:35] <bberry> >> var test
[11:10:42] <bberry> :(
[11:12:12] <maxmoore14> anybody familiar with foreign language settings? I am building a custom solution to localize my app.
[11:12:29] <maxmoore14> curious about decimal points and how to handle countries that use commas
[11:13:10] <maxmoore14> I have a quick ajax call to my server which returns the Accept-Language header that is sent by the browser
[11:13:20] <maxmoore14> so I can determine what language the user has selected as preferred
[11:13:45] <maxmoore14> and I'm using custom dictionaries to replace strings throughout my app
[11:14:08] <maxmoore14> that way I can just load es_ES for example to override en_US
[11:14:33] <maxmoore14> my problem is, I have a few calculators in my app where I accept user input for calculations
[11:14:45] <maxmoore14> one is actually just a simple basic calculator
[11:15:42] <maxmoore14> I take the user input, clean it up, and (don't yell at me) run eval()
[11:16:08] <maxmoore14> so eval(5.5 + 1.5) gives a result of 7
[11:16:34] <maxmoore14> I can allow the user to enter 5,5 + 1,5 possibly
[11:16:46] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: did you say something to me?
[11:17:25] <maxmoore14> but my question is - does javascript adjust to foreign languages? or should I .replace(/,/g '.')
[11:18:49] <maxmoore14> also, related - is there a way to detect a browser setting that tells me if the user prefers . or ,
[11:19:14] <maxmoore14> because I've read there are some cases where the settings for language and math can be different
[11:20:47] <maxmoore14> well, I found the answer to my first question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12004808/does-javascript-take-local-decimal-separators-into-account
[11:31:00] <maxmoore14> and #2:   new Number(1.1).toLocaleString().substr(1, 1)
[11:31:39] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 afaik javascript does not provide internationalization support out of the box.
[11:31:55] <SlexAxton> there is a new globalization api
[11:32:06] <SlexAxton> and there was always a little bit a of crappy stuff
[11:32:30] <SlexAxton> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString
[11:32:54] <SlexAxton> that was added in ES3
[11:33:15] <duch_kazatel> eh, Number.prototype.toLocaleString()
[11:33:15] <duch_kazatel> Produces a string value that represents the value of the Number formatted according to the conventions of the host environment’s current locale. This function is implementation-dependent, and it is permissible, but not encouraged, for it to return the same thing as toString.
[11:33:26] <duch_kazatel> that’s in the spec - ecmascript fail.
[11:33:58] <duch_kazatel> new spec looks better but the browser support is less than idea.
[11:34:02] <duch_kazatel> *ideal
[11:35:30] <shoky> SlexAxton didn't you write some neat internationalization lib a while back?
[11:35:40] <SlexAxton> messageformat.js
[11:35:44] <SlexAxton> interpolation
[11:36:38] <shoky> ah. thx
[11:41:23] <BlaDe^_> Has anyone worked with flot for graphs?
[11:50:27] <sunbeam> how can I see what happens when I click on submit a form (I want to see what ajax does )
[11:50:33] <sunbeam> I mean to where it submits with ajax
[11:51:07] <jKlaus_work> hey guys.. is there a fast way to remove all of the options within a select.. $(select).remove() seems to be vary slow
[11:51:21] <jKlaus_work> Note that there are probably 70k options
[11:56:21] <tw2113> 70k options for 1 select input?
[11:57:47] <BillCriswell> That's hardcode.
[11:57:49] <BillCriswell> hardcore*
[11:57:52] <jKlaus_work> yes ..
[11:57:53] <jKlaus_work> lol
[11:57:57] <jKlaus_work> this a problem
[11:58:02] <jKlaus_work> tis*
[11:58:12] <tw2113> google "select2"
[11:58:19] <Velveeta> woo hoo! we finally made the move away from mercurial and onto git!
[11:58:19] <jKlaus_work> but its actually far more than 70k
[11:58:43] <jKlaus_work> there are 70k applications.. this select actually contains an option for every application installed on every devices so.. its probably over 200k
[11:58:59] <Velveeta> jklaus: you can try element.options.length = 0
[11:59:03] <jKlaus_work> I can't use a different controller.  This is a sharepoint form
[11:59:09] <Velveeta> i don't know if that'll be any faster than remove or not
[11:59:16] <jKlaus_work> Loaded via sharepoint.. I can only modify it after load
[11:59:25] <tw2113> ouch
[11:59:38] <jKlaus_work> Velveeta.. unfortunately it does not seem to be any faster :-\
[12:00:01] <Velveeta> we have some option lists here with tens of thousands of options, but not in a select element, we have a beautified widget that renders them as li's in a ul list
[12:00:22] <Velveeta> and that one's a drag on resources also, at some point, when i get the time, i'm gonna rework it to present a sliding window of rendered options
[12:00:36] <jKlaus_work> What about .. $(select).html()
[12:00:42] <jKlaus_work> err
[12:00:46] <Velveeta> as you scroll around, it'll remove the farthest past items and render the next chunk before you get to them, to keep the interface snappy
[12:00:47] <jKlaus_work> $(select).html("")
[12:00:52] <Velveeta> at least, in theory
[12:01:11] <jKlaus_work> Well let me give you some context on this thing
[12:01:57] <Velveeta> is it icd10 codes? :D
[12:02:06] <Velveeta> cuz there are around 70000 of those
[12:02:25] <jKlaus_work> I remove all of the options in the device and application install select on page load.  The user then selects a device owner and I programmatically create new device options based on the owner .. only a few devices.  Once they select a device I then create the applications options based on that device.. once again only a subset of the original options
[12:02:40] <jKlaus_work> The 'on the fly' generation of options works great
[12:02:55] <jKlaus_work> but the emptying of the original set is what takes so long.
[12:05:53] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I kind of feel like typeahead would be the only sane way to handle that many options.
[12:06:33] <Velveeta> it definitely helps, we have a filter textbox in place for those things, but in the case of them clearing it out, they should get the full list
[12:06:55] <jKlaus_work> The user doesn't see all of those options
[12:07:21] <jKlaus_work> I limit the options seen by the user.  The issue is I'm stuck using the "OOTB" functionality
[12:07:36] <jKlaus_work> and the OOTB functionality loads every freaking option lol
[12:08:07] <BillCriswell> What's OOTB?
[12:08:14] <BillCriswell> Think I jumped in late.
[12:08:15] <tw2113> out of the box
[12:08:22] <BillCriswell> Oh, duh.
[12:08:24] <jKlaus_work> Its sharepoint crap
[12:08:49] <jKlaus_work> If they had let us make this an ASP.Net app we wouldn't have these problems
[12:08:50] <BillCriswell> That sounds scary.
[12:09:03] <jKlaus_work> indeed
[12:09:11] <jKlaus_work> I hate sharepoint with a passion
[12:09:31] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what it is. Hopefully it stays that way.
[12:09:46] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/1/   <-- how do i start with div1 and make it switch to div2 or div3 when i click the appropriate link?
[12:10:08] <BillCriswell> tables: tabs?
[12:10:14] <jKlaus_work> booom
[12:10:20] <tables> BillCriswell, yea like tabs
[12:10:59] <jKlaus_work> $(select).html("") seems to be quicker than $(select).empty()
[12:11:06] <jKlaus_work> a whole lot quicker..
[12:11:17] <BillCriswell> There's a lot of ways to do it, but is this the HTML you're stuck with?
[12:12:04] <shoky> jKlaus_work  .empty() removes each option individually, of course it's slow
[12:12:11] <shoky> you said .remove() before
[12:12:15] <shoky> which is quick
[12:12:40] <tables> BillCriswell, yea
[12:13:03] <jKlaus_work> damn it shoky lol.. I'm stupid
[12:13:13] <jKlaus_work> though $(select).remove() wouldn't have worked..
[12:13:24] <shoky> ah no it doesn't remove each individually actually
[12:13:26] <jKlaus_work> well I mean it would have gotten rid of the options.. just also the select
[12:13:41] <jKlaus_work> oh.. so you lied to me
[12:13:43] <shoky> jKlaus_work:  so.. .replaceWith('<select>')
[12:14:19] <BillCriswell> tables: with your HTML: http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/3/
[12:14:55] <jKlaus_work> shoky I can't there is all kinds of events, styling, etc already on the select via sharepoint
[12:15:00] <jKlaus_work> can't replace with a new select
[12:15:32] <shoky> eh ;s
[12:17:12] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/4/   <-- can you make it work with id's, not a's and div's ?
[12:17:14] <tables> BillCriswell,
[12:17:16] <tables> ^
[12:18:20] <shoky> jKlaus_work oh actually .empty() does loop through each option, i think, heh
[12:18:20] <BillCriswell> tables: I can. It's a silly way to approach it so I won't, though.
[12:18:49] <tables> why is it silly?
[12:18:54] <BillCriswell> If you have a parent element you can do $('.parent a') and $('.parent div').
[12:19:17] <BillCriswell> The HTML doesn't give you a clean way to handle it.
[12:19:45] <jKlaus_work> shoky, I'm starting to think you can't make up your mind.. lol
[12:20:42] <shoky> jKlaus_work well at first i said it removes each option individually,  now i'm only saying it loops through each option ;p
[12:21:00] <jKlaus_work> lol
[12:21:05] <jKlaus_work> which is the same thingg
[12:21:11] <shoky> jKlaus_work also i'm very tired and jquery src is playing tricks on me ;p
[12:21:41] <jKlaus_work> $(select).empty() sucks, $(select).children().remove() sucks, $(select).html('') is about the best approach
[12:21:48] <s3d_matt> evening all
[12:21:49] <BillCriswell> tables: http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/5/ this is why it's so terrible, it's not reusable.
[12:21:52] <shoky> it loops through each option to remove data/events, then does .textContent = '';
[12:22:22] <jKlaus_work> I think .empty() may just execute a .children().empty()
[12:22:25] <jKlaus_work> err
[12:22:28] <shoky> jKlaus_work yea .html('') seems to be the best fit for you
[12:22:29] <jKlaus_work> .children().remove()
[12:22:33] <shoky> jKlaus_work nah it doesn't
[12:22:39] <jKlaus_work> sure about that?
[12:22:47] <jKlaus_work> takes right about the same amount of time
[12:22:52] <shoky> jKlaus_work  it does jQuery.cleanData( getAll( elem, false ) );    elem.textContent = "";.
[12:22:56] <tables> BillCriswell, thanks
[12:23:07] <BillCriswell> tables: ok =(
[12:23:09] <shoky> jKlaus_work  and getAll will select all the options
[12:23:18] <jKlaus_work> hmm
[12:23:18] <s3d_matt> Hi all, I have this validation javascript, which at the bottom has two functions I've made.  I want to add these as <scripts> in the page rather than this static file - how do I do that?
[12:23:19] <s3d_matt> http://pastebin.com/HUXPmhSF
[12:23:20] <rainabba> There a resonably way to select by css values (like display:table-cell) or should I just add classes and use those?
[12:24:22] <s3d_matt> basically its adding another rule one the array(?) has nee setup: http://pastebin.com/HUXPmhSF
[12:24:24] <shoky> classes ^
[12:24:26] <s3d_matt> brrn*
[12:24:31] <BillCriswell> rainabba: classes.
[12:24:32] <s3d_matt> been*
[12:26:45] <BillCriswell> rainabba: You could do something like $('el').filter(function(){ return this.style.display === 'table-cell'; }), but adding classes would be more sane.
[12:27:12] <BillCriswell> Just wanted to show you a way.
[12:27:22] <rainabba> ty
[12:27:26] <rainabba> classes it is
[12:27:45] <s3d_matt> anyone?
[12:28:17] <DelphiWorld> can someone give me his eyes for a second? lol
[12:28:33] <DelphiWorld> i am blind designing my  music homepage for myself:)
[12:28:41] <shoky> you can keep mine
[12:29:04] <s3d_matt> DelphiWorld: sure
[12:29:05] <BillCriswell> Eyes are overrated.
[12:29:21] <DelphiWorld> s3d_matt: :)
[12:29:28] <BillCriswell> Now that I'm thinking about it I really under appreciate mine.
[12:29:28] <Es0teric> how do i make it so that on every click a div becomes visible? (i am doing a single page layout)
[12:29:56] <BillCriswell> A click on the body would make a random div visible?
[12:29:56] <s3d_matt> $(.ID OF DIV).toggle();
[12:30:23] <Es0teric> BillCriswell no its more like… divs on the page, not a random one
[12:30:29] <s3d_matt> please someone help, this is so easy, i just don't understand how to 'add one' http://pastebin.com/HUXPmhSF
[12:31:19] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: so every click divs become visible?
[12:31:41] <Es0teric> BillCriswell yeah… like if i click on a div named "somediv1" on the navigation menu it should make "somediv1" visible
[12:31:44] <BillCriswell> s3d_matt: += 1 ?
[12:31:51] <s3d_matt> helpful:P
[12:32:15] <s3d_matt> $('. somediv1).toggle();
[12:32:22] <shoky> s3d_matt not sure what you need.. maybe  $.validationEngineLanguage.allRules["ajaxClientReference"] = { ... };   ...
[12:32:32] <shoky> that is, not sure what you're asking for
[12:32:42] <s3d_matt> shoky, yeah
[12:32:50] <Es0teric> s3d_matt but at the same time, i want to toggle all of the other divs to hide and only show one at a time
[12:32:52] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/6/         <-- how do i make this work
[12:32:52] <BlaDe^_> does anyone have experience with flot?
[12:32:54] <tables> BillCriswell, ^
[12:33:03] <tables> i need it to work like that, with <script> tags

[12:33:06] <s3d_matt> basically i don't want the rule in the file, i need to add it dynamically (with PHP) and hence in a script tag in the body of the doc
[12:33:09] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: YWhy are you using a div for the navigation items?
[12:33:11] <duch_kazatel> *flot”?
[12:33:28] <Es0teric> BillCriswell the navigation items arent the divs… the divs are in the content
[12:33:40] <Es0teric> navigation items are <li>
[12:33:44] <BlaDe^_> duch_kazatel:  it's a graphing library
[12:33:51] <BlaDe^_> duch_kazatel:  generates canvas' basically
[12:34:19] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: If you have anchors on your links like like href="#item-1" you can juse use that in a selector.
[12:34:20] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric use a data attribute on each nav item that corresponds to a div class or ID.
[12:34:31] <duch_kazatel> or go with BillCriswell’s suggestion.
[12:34:41] <BillCriswell> tables: Lookinto document ready.
[12:34:42] <shoky> s3d_matt what i wrote will add a rule dynamically to that "allRules" object. but no idea if your validation code/plugin will be aware of this update, it depends..
[12:34:52] <duch_kazatel> decouple your shiz and be happy
[12:35:00] <s3d_matt> shoky:  thanks ill give it go now, hopefully it will
[12:35:07] <Es0teric> BillCriswell will that only work with id's?
[12:35:25] <BillCriswell> Yes, it's justa convenient thing. If you want something more complex use a data attribute.
[12:35:38] <Es0teric> BillCriswell but i also want it to animate
[12:36:43] <BillCriswell> That's beside the point.
[12:38:15] <tables> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/7/     why doesn't div3 work now?
[12:38:25] <tables> link3 doesn't work
[12:39:45] <BillCriswell> tables: I don't want to help you debug code I warned you about.
[12:40:19] <tables> could you just help me this once?
[12:41:31] <duch_kazatel> tables what are you trying to do?
[12:41:54] <tables> make link1 switch to content1 then link2 swithc to content2
[12:41:57] <tables> and so on
[12:41:59] <tables> like tabs
[12:42:12] <duch_kazatel> why are you using a script tag in your html and not using the javascript panel?
[12:42:45] <tables> i need it to work with script tag
[12:43:06] <duch_kazatel> wait are you the guy trying to dyinamically generate markup using php?
[12:43:16] <duch_kazatel> *dynamically
[12:43:21] <duch_kazatel> err, scripts, actually.
[12:43:22] <duch_kazatel> not markup lol
[12:43:47] <BillCriswell> tables: $div.hide().eq(idx - 1).show();
[12:44:11] <BillCriswell> The html isn't good though, should definitely try to get something better to work with.
[12:44:25] <tables> thanks
[12:44:28] <s3d_matt> shoky: sadly it didn't like it
[12:45:25] <s3d_matt> you code of $.validationEngineLanguage.allRules[\"ajaxClientReference\"] suggests is an array, but the rules don't appear to be an array in the original file ?
[12:45:26] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:45:34] <s3d_matt> shoky: looks more like bjects?
[12:45:44] <duch_kazatel> s3d that’s not an array.
[12:46:09] <duch_kazatel> s3d_matt square brackets are ways to access object properties. a[prop]
[12:46:20] <s3d_matt> ahh ok
[12:46:23] <duch_kazatel> a[”prop”] is the same as a.prop
[12:47:01] <duch_kazatel> in fact, when accessing array indexes like array[2], you’re actually accessing object properties, but arrays have special rules about how they handle the property names.
[12:47:02] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsbin.com/IWEFUbat/1/edit?html,css,js,output is this what you were going for?
[12:47:52] <shoky> s3d_matt yep what duch said
[12:48:12] <s3d_matt> hmmm thanks duch_kazatel shoky the engine in use is this one, which is pretty popular: https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine
[12:48:23] <s3d_matt> Im confused, and can't find any doc about adding a rule inline
[12:49:34] <BillCriswell> s3d_matt: You mean like class="validate[required]" ?
[12:49:44] <BillCriswell> Wonder why they'd abuse classnames like that.
[12:49:57] <BillCriswell> Oh, should have read the next line.
[12:49:57] <duch_kazatel> ewww that looks ugly.
[12:50:02] <s3d_matt> BillCriswell: ajax[selector] (e.g. validate by calling an ajax call
[12:50:23] <s3d_matt> exact dos is here: https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine#ajaxselector
[12:50:28] <s3d_matt> docs
[12:50:52] * Velveeta peaks up over his wall just long enough to hear the array vs object conversation, then lowers his head again, with shifty eyes...
[12:51:10] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta that conversation will happen as long as javascript it a thing :)
[12:51:15] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:51:25] <duch_kazatel> people want it to be more complicated imo.
[12:51:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel++
[12:52:04] <duch_kazatel> rather, they expect it to be more complicated.
[12:52:33] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I still think I agree more with the first thing you said.
[12:52:46] <s3d_matt> any ideas from https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine#ajaxselector?
[12:52:52] <Velveeta> ewww at that jquery validation engine… they should have done that stuff with data attributes
[12:53:06] <s3d_matt> its the better one out there!
[12:53:18] <Velveeta> the better one for what exactly?
[12:53:22] <duch_kazatel> hahaha.  i actually agree with that more depending on who you’re talking about.
[12:53:51] <s3d_matt> the call is to check uniqueness of a field, the only issue is when they edit, i need to allow the same entry
[12:54:18] <s3d_matt> oooo
[12:54:29] <s3d_matt> unless i can set a variable in the doc, which that function can address
[12:54:42] <s3d_matt> e.g. <script> var taskID = 12; </script>
[12:55:03] <s3d_matt> "url": "/task/edit/clientrefCheck/"+taskID,
[12:55:28] <s3d_matt> would that work (id imagine not as its out of scope, or needs to be parent or something
[12:55:28] <s3d_matt> ?
[12:56:11] <s3d_matt> or some query magic to find the value of a field and add that var to the url?
[12:57:08] <BillCriswell> Any of you guys use Mixture?
[12:59:13] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I have a string the represents a date("2013-02-04") that I am passing to the date constructor but it is returning a date object with a day of '3' instead of '4'.  I am assuming that there is some sort of conversion going on from GMT that is messing with things.  Can anyone help me?
[12:59:34] <duch_kazatel> louism2wash have a fiddle?
[12:59:56] <Es0teric> BillCriswell yes but it shows them one at a time, it doesnt keep showing each one
[13:00:16] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell I don’t, but the stuff I’m working with lately doesn’t really need that kind of editor.
[13:00:26] <duch_kazatel> then again, i’m terribly stubborn, sooo.
[13:00:33] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Say what?
[13:00:39] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/8/    <-- what should i change the 'href="#"' to for my links, to make it work without reloading the page?
[13:00:55] <tables> if i use 'href="#"' it reloads the page on my site
[13:01:00] <duch_kazatel> tables your approach is very broken - i’d reccommend reformulating it.
[13:01:02] <tables> although not on stackoverflow
[13:01:12] <tables> it works ok for me
[13:01:14] <Es0teric> BillCriswell lets say i click on item 1 right? then item 2… item 1 should be hidden and item 2 should be shown
[13:01:24] <louism2wash> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/n4KFK/
[13:01:29] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: So you want tabs as well?
[13:01:41] <Es0teric> BillCriswell no tabs… i just want one visible at a time
[13:01:49] <BillCriswell> Everything is tabs to me.
[13:02:08] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well theoretically yes, it would work like a tab
[13:02:10] <Es0teric> but it isnt
[13:02:45] <duch_kazatel> tables the way you’re building this won’t be very maintainable.  it’s going to be a nightmare down the road for troubleshooting and modifying.
[13:03:14] <tables> don't i just need to change the href="#" to whatever that doesn't reload the page?
[13:03:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Been down that road thrice!
[13:04:17] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsbin.com/IWEFUbat/2/edit?html,js,output
[13:04:51] <BillCriswell> You don't need the var $items = $('.item'); at the top, brain fart.
[13:04:59] <bdowling> Got a question about jquery-ui dialogs and an overlay issue wondering if anyone can help me decide if its a bug or not.
[13:05:44] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well that seems to work lol.. yeah thats exactly what i was looking for
[13:06:11] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: You don't see that as tabs though? :-p
[13:06:27] <Es0teric> BillCriswell well it does work like tabs lol
[13:07:10] <duch_kazatel> hi tables: http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/10/
[13:08:27] <duch_kazatel> there’s your solution that doesn’t require any kind of dymaic js rendering, which is a terrible, terrible idea.
[13:08:33] <bdowling> Here's the test..  http://jsfiddle.net/3uMY8/3/  What happens is one dialog will work, the other will have the overlay placed on top of it.  I think this happens because it was moved after being created, so the .siblings() call doesn't work right to fix the zindexing.  At least that's my theory.
[13:10:00] <duch_kazatel> *dynamic
[13:10:27] <BillCriswell> dymaic has a nice ring to it.
[13:10:47] <duch_kazatel> new js lib name idea.
[13:11:34] <BillCriswell> die-may-ic?
[13:11:45] <BillCriswell> die may ick*
[13:13:07] <louism2wash> !date
[13:13:07] <Neo> The Date Is Wed Jan 15 13:13:05 PST 2014
[13:14:21] <duch_kazatel> pronounced “die-may-ick” imo.  spell it “dyemayiq”
[13:18:02] <bdowling> er, maybe I should ask that Q: on ui-dev ?
[13:18:23] <s3d_matt> is there a way of getting the value of a input element?  e.g. $(data_itemID).val()  if on the page there is a <input type='text' data_itemID='number1"....
[13:18:49] <duch_kazatel> s3d_matt are you trying to select using data_itemID='number1"?
[13:19:25] <s3d_matt> no, just pass a value over tot his damn validator using its extraDataDynamic option
[13:19:36] <s3d_matt> DOC: "extraDataDynamic": ['#user_id', '#user_email'],
[13:19:42] <s3d_matt> Note: extraDataDynamic - optional DOM id's that should have their values sent as parameters
[13:19:47] <duch_kazatel> $(‘input[data_itemID=”number1”]’).val() - that’s how you’d get the value.
[13:20:18] <s3d_matt> duch_kazatel: so to get that element just: input[data_itemID])
[13:20:41] <duch_kazatel> s3d_matt you need input[data_itemID=”number1”]
[13:20:50] <s3d_matt> i don't know the number1 part
[13:20:52] <s3d_matt> that is the value
[13:21:33] <duch_kazatel> oh you’re trying to get the data_itemID?  that’s $(‘input’).attr(‘data_itemID’);
[13:21:54] <duch_kazatel> unless you used data-itemID, then you could use $(‘input’).data(‘itemID’);
[13:22:11] <s3d_matt> duch_kazatel:  needs to be in this format
[13:22:12] <s3d_matt> DOC: "extraDataDynamic": ['#user_id', '#user_email'],
[13:22:29] <duch_kazatel> just telling you your options.
[13:22:33] <s3d_matt> k
[13:22:34] <s3d_matt> thanks
[13:26:02] <reinman> morning duch_kazatal - got another question for you. this is the mock-up for the comic book website we discussed yesterday - http://reinman.pythonanywhere.com/  (built via bootstrap). each of the rectangles represents an image w/ a carousel activated on mouse over. if we assume that there's an average of 7 images per carousel, that's a total of 700 images per page. yikes. do you have any suggestions to make these images responsive &
[13:26:27] <duch_kazatel> “make these images responsive”?
[13:26:33] <duch_kazatel> what is your expectation with that sentence.
[13:26:53] <reinman> each image fits the full container for desktop, tablet, mobile
[13:28:11] <duch_kazatel> keep in mind there’s an actual thing called “responsive images” that’s all about changing what you see and what the focal point is.
[13:29:08] <onenine90> hey guys. I have a div that contains a couple things, including some canvas elements. When I try to move the div to another part of the page, using jquery, or even if I duplicate the div using query, the canvas elements seem to be wiped of their image. The element themselves are still there, but the image is gone. Any ideas?
[13:29:08] <reinman> hmm... what do you mean by focal point?
[13:29:31] <duch_kazatel> i’d do 2 things if I were you.  1 - implement pagination and load a limited subset of comics per page.
[13:30:01] <duch_kazatel> the images on initial pageload should be sized appropriately.
[13:30:07] <duch_kazatel> then on modal launch, reference a larger version from the server.
[13:30:21] <duch_kazatel> you don’t want to use responsive images quite yet ;)
[13:30:45] <duch_kazatel> anyway, launch the modal and size it appropriately from ther.e
[13:30:47] <duch_kazatel> that’s what i’d do.
[13:30:48] <reinman> hah, looks like im misusing the word
[13:31:17] <reinman> by modal, do you mean this? http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
[13:32:01] <duch_kazatel> yup
[13:32:56] <cortexman> can I get a jqueryui autocomplete to always show its list..?
[13:33:38] <dmarr> how would i take an object and return a custom serialization for it? { w:200 , h:11 } => w=200,h=11
[13:34:41] <duch_kazatel> dmarr are you just trying to print out a string?
[13:34:49] <dmarr> yeah
[13:35:00] <reinman> ahh, but want if i want to display all the images without using a popover. correct me if im wrong, but it seems like you're suggesting i display the carousel after a user clicks on the image. id just prefer to show them everything on hover.
[13:35:24] <BillCriswell> dmarr: Think you'd just need to loop.
[13:35:39] <duch_kazatel> dmarr look at for...in and hasOwnProperty()
[13:36:01] <duch_kazatel> reinman what you’re suggesting will take a loooong time to load.
[13:36:13] <duch_kazatel> but if you just want the carousel on hover, there are tons of plugins for that.
[13:37:26] <BillCriswell> dmarr: Where is the data originating from?
[13:37:51] <reinman> lol, alright, i'll hash out the mvp with the modals
[13:37:56] <reinman> appreciate the help
[13:38:33] <RonWhoCares> I don't understand why my jquery is not triggering when the AMEN link is clicked on @ http://jsfiddle.net/rNS6L/
[13:39:32] <BillCriswell> RonWhoCares: It is. You didn't include jQuery in the fiddle though.
[13:39:33] <duch_kazatel> RonWhoCares http://i.imgur.com/PtIPqUm.png
[13:41:53] <RonWhoCares> I made the change to include jQuery 1.7.2 --- what I am using on my site  http://jsfiddle.net/rNS6L/1/
[13:42:27] <BillCriswell> RonWhoCares: Still working.
[13:46:31] <RonWhoCares> I don't see it in the console
[13:46:36] <RonWhoCares> or when I add an "alert"
[13:47:44] <duch_kazatel> RonWhoCares add it to the fiddle?
[13:48:28] <BillCriswell> RonWhoCares: Check the "Network" tab, see if the request is make. If it's red that means bad.
[13:48:39] <BillCriswell> request is made*
[13:49:03] <dmarr> how do people usally center popups?
[13:49:21] <dmarr> BillCriswell: you can ignore that serialization question- i am just crafting the string manually
[13:50:41] <duch_kazatel> dmarr like a modal popup?
[13:50:50] <dmarr> yeah, im using window.open
[13:50:59] <BillCriswell> Oh... ick.
[13:51:06] <duch_kazatel> err, then you don’t.
[13:51:11] <duch_kazatel> that’s not a modal.
[13:51:14] <dmarr> you can pass in left and top
[13:51:15] <duch_kazatel> use a modal :)
[13:51:32] <duch_kazatel> you sure can!
[13:52:26] <BillCriswell> dmarr: There are browser settings that can make this task a bitch, just a heads up.
[13:53:02] <dmarr> well its not pretty but http://dpaste.com/1553400/
[13:53:23] <duch_kazatel> dmarr use a modal.
[13:53:27] <dmarr> duch_kazatel: like with jquery ui? i am pointing people off the site
[13:53:40] <dmarr> opening a fb share dialog
[13:54:15] <BillCriswell> Doesn't facebook do that all for you through their API though?
[13:54:25] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell they can depending on which one you’re using.
[13:54:46] <dmarr> yeah but im just  taking a standard fb.com/share link and opening it in popup
[13:54:54] <dmarr> i dont really want it to be modal necessarily
[13:54:57] <duch_kazatel> dmarr there are solutions out there for centering, but you shouldn’t need to worry about it with that you’re doing.
[13:55:01] <BillCriswell> dmarr: Got it.
[13:55:21] <dmarr> my solution is fine. centers in the users window
[13:55:28] <dmarr> s/window/screen
[13:55:33] <duch_kazatel> dmarr i’ve got live production code that just just opens the popup without trying to center.
[13:55:44] <duch_kazatel> also make sure your stuff doesn’t break for users with more than 1 monitor ;)
[13:55:46] <dmarr> yeah, that was the oether option
[13:55:50] <dmarr> oh good thinking
[13:55:58] <duch_kazatel> just ignore the positioning and you’ll be fine.
[13:55:59] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[13:59:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah. He's a doctor.
[13:59:32] <duch_kazatel> aaaaahahahaha
[13:59:48] <duch_kazatel> gettin’ surgical up in yo bid-nezz
[14:00:12] <BillCriswell> Siiiiiiiiiiiiit.
[14:05:19] <AliG1000> I am using the following to get the attr of a tr tag within a table:
[14:05:21] <AliG1000>  $('.inbox-content .view-message').live('click', function () {
[14:05:21] <AliG1000>      var sentmessages_id = $(this).parents("tr").attr("data-sentmessageid"); //get message id
[14:05:21] <AliG1000> 	 loadMessageSent(sentmessages_id);
[14:05:21] <AliG1000>  });
[14:05:30] <duch_kazatel> AliG1000 noooo use a fiddle
[14:06:25] <DaveH> any good php irc rooms?
[14:07:06] <BillCriswell> DaveH: ##php
[14:07:09] <duch_kazatel> try ##php?
[14:07:19] <BillCriswell> They tend to get a little snooty... just try to follow the rules.
[14:07:41] <AliG1000> sorry.  try this: http://jsfiddle.net/hYDjm/
[14:07:45] <duch_kazatel> you’d be like that too if you had to work with that language all the time.
[14:07:57] <BillCriswell> I do. =(
[14:08:07] <duch_kazatel> it’s cool - ready for a laugh?
[14:08:18] <BillCriswell> I just don't help out in there often. I'm in like 15 rooms, participate in like... 2.
[14:08:20] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[14:08:38] <duch_kazatel> we use coldfusion here
[14:08:41] <DaveH> can't seem to join ##php
[14:08:43] <duch_kazatel> lik, that’s our frontend.
[14:09:03] <BillCriswell> DaveH: Probably have to register.
[14:09:11] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Lots of people seem to be stuck with it.
[14:09:14] <duch_kazatel> AliG1000 you need to give each table a unique ID or class.
[14:09:18] <DaveH> Thanks Bill
[14:09:27] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[14:09:47] <AliG1000> duch_kazatel.  thank you, but how do I call them using the jquery?
[14:10:07] <duch_kazatel> AliG1000 first don’t use .live(), use .on()
[14:11:08] <duch_kazatel> second, pass a second arg to .on() that is the selector you’re looking for.  something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/hYDjm/1/
[14:11:11] <AliG1000> I tried .on, but couldn't get that to work.  so I'll stick with .live for a bit, but I just need to get the rest of the jquery right
[14:11:43] <duch_kazatel> why are you using .live()?  are these elements getting dynamically inserted to the page?
[14:11:51] <duch_kazatel> because .live is deprecated.
[14:12:18] <AliG1000> nope - I'm just adusting someone else's code
[14:12:39] <AliG1000> I will try the #tableId
[14:13:04] <duch_kazatel> AliG1000 not sure about .live()s syntax for that, but you should be able to migrate to .on() pretty easily.
[14:17:24] <BillCriswell> Take it easy everyone!
[14:23:01] <murph> Is this page broken for everyone? https://jquery.org/license/
[14:23:45] <duch_kazatel> looks like a bad redirect.  funky./
[14:35:55] <Cork> murph: if you want to read it https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE.txt
[14:36:37] <murph> Cork: thanks. I really do know the license by heart, I was just curious if the org has provided any personal preferences for the style of it's inclusion
[14:36:49] <murph> for example, can I just link it from my .js source, or do they want it verbatim?
[14:36:59] <murph> My minification process tends to remove it
[14:37:13] <Cork> murph: if you know it by hart you should know :)
[14:37:21] <Cork> it is stated in the license
[14:38:07] <murph> Well, "included in all copies" is a bit open to interpretation. So i was going to see if they had any stated preference.
[14:38:34] <murph> like i have 5 .js files with it that get combined to one master file
[14:38:38] <Cork> murph: it means a copy of the license needs to be included
[14:38:40] <murph> should i have 5 copies? :)
[14:38:53] <Cork> uh, no
[14:39:08] <Cork> that specific file is enough
[14:39:15] <murph> mmmkay.
[14:39:34] <Cork> there is also a header is jquery.js that needs to be there
[14:39:58] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/11/    <-- this worked with jquery 2.0.2, can someone help me make it work with 1.6.4?
[14:40:29] <Cork> murph: but just to be sure, it needs to be included in releases
[14:40:40] <Cork> murph: you don't have to host it on a site to use jquery
[14:41:07] <murph> Cork: You don't count website use as redistribution?
[14:41:20] <Cork> murph: it is, but not a release
[14:41:31] <Cork> the header in the jquery file is enough for use
[14:41:35] <murph> mmmkay
[14:53:25] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/11/    <-- this worked with jquery 2.0.2, can someone help me make it work with 1.6.4?
[14:54:49] <duch_kazatel> tables I gave you beautiful code that worked flawlessly earlier.
[14:54:53] <grafi> the hell are you using 1.6.4 for oô
[14:55:09] <grafi> ugh
[14:55:12] <Cork> tables: replace on with bind
[14:55:27] <Cork> tables: rest should just work
[14:55:30] <grafi> poeple that put js in the html window ._.
[14:55:33] <tables> duch_kazatel, can you try to fix this one?   i'm trying to learn a proof of concept
[14:55:40] <tables> i'm actually probably gonna end up using yours though
[14:55:42] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/12/
[14:55:42] <tables> but i'm studying
[14:55:45] <Cork> ya...
[14:56:04] <duch_kazatel> tables i refuse to go with your broken methodology - grafi he’s trying to dynamically generate JS.
[14:56:22] <grafi> oô
[14:56:28] <grafi> and replace us all?
[14:56:29] <grafi> xD
[14:56:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah exactly.
[14:56:33] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:56:40] <grafi> skynet is comming
[14:57:09] <Cork> emscripten is already here :)
[14:57:38] <grafi> oh ma gawd
[14:57:54] <grafi> im going to invent my own language
[14:58:24] <grafi> i shall call it oh-my-fuck
[14:58:33] <grafi> omf for short
[14:58:34] <grafi> <:
[14:58:37] <duch_kazatel> will it be anything like brainfuck?
[14:58:42] <duch_kazatel> or INTERCAL?
[14:59:05] <grafi> it will be brainfuck transpiling to chicken transpiling to js
[14:59:11] <grafi> or something
[14:59:17] <grafi> what do I know about how that works
[14:59:20] <duch_kazatel> needs more coffescript and typescript
[14:59:22] <grafi> the answer is not much
[14:59:24] <limpc> looks like when using css transforms to alter the X position of an element, the element's 'left' css value never changes?

[15:00:16] <grafi> i read that blogpost

[15:00:25] <Cork> it's opensource! :D
[15:00:59] <grafi> how great
[15:01:00] <grafi> :D
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> wut
[15:01:12] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[15:01:14] <duch_kazatel> that’s different.
[15:01:46] <limpc> so when using css transforms to manipulate an element's X coordinate, the .left css property of the element doesn't change. which is really screwing with my carousel, because it needs to move the offscreen ul element to the end of the adjancent (and visible) UL element so the carousel is 'infinite'
[15:01:56] <limpc> but im at a loss on how to do this
[15:02:53] <duch_kazatel> limpc that’s because css transitions don’t mess with other properties.
[15:03:33] <limpc> yeah thats what i said :)
[15:03:55] <limpc> how can i use the transform property to calculate the next position of the adjancent UL element?
[15:04:14] <limpc> they rotate, so one is in front of the other in turn
[15:05:44] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/12/   <-- how do you load div1 onload?
[15:05:44] <tables> or start with div1?
[15:06:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/13/
[15:12:56] <mento> Hi guys, i'm trying to show a span when a certain span has a classname disabled, i just can't seem to get it to work http://jsfiddle.net/asgG2/
[15:13:44] <mento> ah, wrong link - this is the right one: http://jsfiddle.net/asgG2/2/
[15:16:02] <duch_kazatel> mento because there is no div.next
[15:16:10] <mento> duch_kazatel:  i just realized
[15:16:17] <mento> duch_kazatel:  i should get some sleep -.-
[15:16:20] <mento> thanks though!
[15:17:15] <duch_kazatel> NEEEEEEEETSPLITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
[15:21:23] <dmacedo> hello everyone
[15:21:32] <duch_kazatel> hello dmacedo
[15:21:50] <dmacedo> what's up? :D
[15:22:01] <duch_kazatel> hating coldfusion.
[15:22:20] <duch_kazatel> the dude that wrote “php: a fractal of bad design” obviously never worked with this mess.
[15:22:39] <dmacedo> hah
[15:22:47] <dmacedo> glad I got away from CF at early stages
[15:23:18] <dmacedo> only PHP/Python/Ruby/Perl for me
[15:23:20] <dmacedo> and in that order
[15:23:28] <duch_kazatel> our company is relatively successful and has so much time invested in it at this point to make it difficult to get away.
[15:24:18] <dmacedo> hm... you could make management... kind of disapear
[15:24:34] <dmacedo> *disappear even
[15:24:34] <duch_kazatel> wouldn’t want to - they’re part of why i took this job :)
[15:24:52] <dmacedo> ok, going easier, just a simple accident here and there, then (=
[15:25:50] <mento> i'm still struggling with this little thing - http://jsfiddle.net/asgG2/6/ works perfectly now. But the class "disabled" is already set on the element. How do i get it to work if the "disabled" class is added after the user clicked on this case on the last slide? The next button will go "disabled" and i need to show the finish text
[15:26:57] <duch_kazatel> mento put it in your click event binding callback.
[15:33:08] <rhizome> is it reasonable to use anything like bubbling/events to change a class on one thing dependent on another class changing? this is for tabnav where a category and list should change classes in tandem
[15:33:24] <duch_kazatel> rhizome no.
[15:33:28] <dmacedo> WAT?
[15:33:38] <duch_kazatel> rhizome you should bind to the events, not to the class changing.
[15:35:07] <andromedian> css animations or Jquery that is the question.
[15:35:28] <duch_kazatel> andromedian depends on what you’re doing and what all you need to support.
[15:35:30] <rhizome> hm, trying to get my head around this. it's pretty basic: if no "active" class, then add it to the first of each list. i guess i'm getting hung up on the order of operations
[15:35:44] <duch_kazatel> rhizome on pageload?
[15:35:48] <rhizome> yeah
[15:36:02] <duch_kazatel> that’s pretty simple.  simple if check.
[15:36:05] <duch_kazatel> have a jsfiddle?
[15:36:20] <andromedian> duch_kazatel, i want to learn one of them at expert level and i am scratching my head which is going to be, although i am expert in css
[15:36:35] <rhizome> yeah, i have the initial just fine. maybe i'm thinking too much and i already basically have it.
[15:36:36] <duch_kazatel> andromedian learn both.
[15:37:02] <andromedian> duch_kazatel, and use jquery animations only if i want to support older browsers?
[15:37:27] <duch_kazatel> andromedian it entirely depends on your use case, codebase, etc.
[15:37:45] <andromedian> thanks for your insights duch_kazatel
[15:37:51] <duch_kazatel> but i’d suggest going with both.
[15:39:17] <andromedian> i wil master css first and then i am going to master them i guess
[15:39:31] <duch_kazatel> andromedian do you know javascript at all?
[15:40:06] <andromedian> yes but not as good as css where i can do whatever i want
[15:40:41] <duch_kazatel> i’d change that :) you should have a firm enough grasp of the three frontent languages that you know when to use what, where.
[15:40:47] <duch_kazatel> *frontend
[15:41:25] <andromedian> duch_kazatel, i am trying :) but web design is so complex subject when you draw and you develop
[15:41:48] <duch_kazatel> i am aware :) i get the luxury of focusing on development.
[15:42:32] <andromedian> yes i know but trying to be cutting edge in both worlds is hell of a task duch_kazatel
[15:42:58] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[15:44:18] <derryl> andromedian: tell me about it
[15:44:28] <derryl> it's tough, but duch is right -- you should learn all three
[15:44:32] <duch_kazatel> you guys work at companies or as freelance?
[15:44:35] <derryl> the Holy Trinity of web
[15:44:41] <derryl> i work at a company
[15:44:54] <duch_kazatel> we avoid having our designers develop and vice/versa
[15:45:09] <derryl> sometimes unavoidable at smaller companies
[15:45:20] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/gbTpP/2/   <-- how do i make this work for 1.6.4 jquery?   it works on 1.9.1 but not 1.6.4
[15:45:21] <duch_kazatel> sure - i used to work for a much smaller place.
[15:45:44] <derryl> tables: there is no javascript in this fiddle
[15:45:48] <duch_kazatel> tables somebody told.
[15:45:53] <derryl> ah nvm i see
[15:45:54] <tables> it's on the bottom of HTML
[15:46:05] <duch_kazatel> tables put the javascript in the correct pane.
[15:46:14] <mento> duch_kazatel: yay, got it solved! time for some rest now. Have a wonderful day all :)
[15:46:23] <tables> i need it like that so it works on my site duch_kazatel
[15:46:26] <duch_kazatel> tables somebody told you exactly what you need to do.
[15:46:39] <duch_kazatel> tables use bind() instead of on()
[15:47:15] <duch_kazatel> mento awesome!  enjoy!
[15:47:40] <derryl> tables: such is right -- http://jsfiddle.net/derryl/gbTpP/3/
[15:47:43] <derryl> duch*
[15:47:57] <duch_kazatel> literal drop-in there.
[15:47:59] <andromedian> Freelance duch_kazatel  but i agree that usually those task are seperated but if you want to be senior web designer they are not
[15:48:23] <duch_kazatel> andromedian that’s why i’m not a designer ;)  our senior devs stay away from designing as much as possible.
[15:48:50] <derryl> the "should designers code" and "should developers know how to design" topic has raged for a while... plenty of opinions on both sides of the table
[15:48:57] <duch_kazatel> though it’s good to know what you’re doing with conventions.
[15:49:03] <duch_kazatel> it certainly has :)
[15:49:28] <derryl> i started life as an artist, but also started coding early -- simply because it's fun to create things
[15:49:43] <derryl> but it can hurt your expertise in one of those areas if you're always a "generalist"
[15:49:51] <duch_kazatel> it can.
[15:50:00] <duch_kazatel> you tend to learn a bit of the other when focusing on one, luckily.
[15:50:10] <derryl> so i'm a pretty good designer and a pretty good coder ..... but i'm not a baller at either
[15:50:46] <andromedian> i am not going to develop apps that's for sure
[15:50:48] <derryl> i think people work best in teams anyway, with different skill sets, yet some overlap -- so they can communicate fluidly with each other
[15:50:57] <Velveeta> ^^ this
[15:51:28] <duch_kazatel> yup
[15:51:42] <aniasis> Why am I not able to return a promise object from within a complete handler?
[15:51:55] <derryl> if you're a single person trying to design your product and also code it up... you will not get very far, unless you have 100% free time
[15:52:11] <duch_kazatel> aniasis it sounds like you’re trying to combine callbacks and promises.
[15:52:54] <Velveeta> the callback receives the jqxhr, so you could technically return it, but you wouldn't be returning it to anything really, except the jquery core where the callback was executed..
[15:53:02] <andromedian> derryl, you can get very far if you are persistent but yes you need a lot of free time :)
[15:53:04] <duch_kazatel> yeah that seems wrong.
[15:53:44] <Velveeta> i'm a single person trying to code my product, i have no delusions of how badly i suck at design, so when i'm ready for that portion, i'll hire that task out :D
[15:53:54] <duch_kazatel> good call.
[15:55:08] <RonWhoCares> duch_kazatel: Can I talk to you for a minute
[15:55:17] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/gbTpP/4/    <-- when i click on a, "Content for div1" comes out, how can i make it come out on load?
[15:55:20] <duch_kazatel> RonWhoCares in a PM?  sure?
[15:55:40] <andromedian> sorry guys for messing the channel with broad questions
[15:55:51] <andromedian> thanks for the feedback though
[15:56:00] <duch_kazatel> andromedian not at all a problem :)
[15:56:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/gbTpP/5/
[15:56:26] <duch_kazatel> tables - do that.
[15:56:59] <tables> duch_kazatel, that doesn't work
[15:57:01] <tables> it duplicates
[15:57:05] <tables> try clicking on the others
[15:57:35] <duch_kazatel> wait wtf are you doing here?
[15:57:41] <duch_kazatel> woah nope.  that’s wrong.
[15:57:49] <duch_kazatel> your setup is bizarre.  what are you trying to do here?  why?
[15:59:36] <tables> i'm trying to do tabs
[16:00:16] <duch_kazatel> why do you keep changing the core functionality?  we gave you something that was working just fine earlier.
[16:00:50] <derryl> lulz
[16:02:05] <duch_kazatel> and then you keep modifying the html/js.
[16:02:11] <duch_kazatel> make up your mind.
[16:02:16] <tables> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/bdMgM/12/    can you make the first div come up then?
[16:02:18] <tables> onload
[16:03:54] <derryl> $('#link1').click()
[16:03:55] <duch_kazatel> tables I did exactly that earlier.
[16:04:02] <derryl> or any other number of ways

[16:05:06] <Tomashe> hey guys , i keep getting this weird msg when using ajax : DataBase Connection Failed: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: No such host is known.
[16:05:23] <Tomashe> what the hell is that
[16:05:36] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe look in your net panel, get the url for the resource, and try hitting it directly.
[16:05:38] <tables> duch_kazatel, thanks
[16:05:50] <Tomashe> hmm
[16:05:57] <Tomashe> bahh its the db file i hate it
[16:06:05] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe that’s an error from the server, not the jquery.
[16:06:18] <nownot> looking for a plugin that will allow me to incorporate divs in a carousel that I can then move by a href link. thoughts?
[16:06:37] <duch_kazatel> nownot try bxlisder
[16:06:48] <duch_kazatel> when I was doing stuff with sliders that was my go-to.
[16:07:00] <nownot> duch_kazatel: thanks
[16:07:55] <duch_kazatel> nownot n
[16:07:57] <duch_kazatel> *np
[16:20:22] <jeffmjack_> why doesn't $('div').click(function () { alert ('hello') }); work by itself on a line?
[16:20:37] <jeffmjack_> like, it seems like it has to be embedded in the document.ready() structure
[16:20:58] <jeffmjack_> but it doesn't work on a line by itself
[16:21:26] <duch_kazatel> because the div may not exist before the doc ready.
[16:21:33] <jeffmjack_> ahhh
[16:21:39] <jeffmjack_> thanks!
[16:21:52] <duch_kazatel> look into using .on() and event binding.
[16:22:04] <jeffmjack_> are there common contexts where one would use jquery outside of the document.ready() structure?
[16:22:27] <duch_kazatel> sure - when the HTML exists before the document read :)
[16:23:14] <duch_kazatel> *ready
[16:23:20] <jeffmjack_> like if you're loading a code snippet or something?
[16:24:15] <EminenceHC> What is the best way using the same update method to render two separate actions,   render action: 'edit' and render action: 'edit2' based on the two separate forms that are submitting the data?
[16:24:38] <duch_kazatel> or if the page throws out markup instead of injecting things after the fact.
[16:24:50] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC that question is bizarre - have a fiddle?
[16:25:36] <jeffmjack_> thanks duch_kazatel
[16:26:04] <derryl> jeffmjack_ also make sure your JS is at the bottom of the page -- this can eliminate some common "DOM ain't ready yet" errors
[16:26:24] <jeffmjack_> thanks
[16:26:42] <jeffmjack_> although it is probably still best practice to optimize for the async nature of things anyway, right?
[16:27:06] <derryl> yup
[16:27:39] <duch_kazatel> generally.
[16:27:58] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Sure, https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/8447549 Both of those views are posting to the same update method. But they need to render to their selves if validation fails.
[16:28:37] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC that’s a lotta ruby.,
[16:28:47] <duch_kazatel> and no javascript.
[16:29:30] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I would like to not use javascript if possible.
[16:29:39] <duch_kazatel> then please go to the ruby channel?
[16:29:59] <EminenceHC> I am an idiot sorry I thought i was in rails channel.
[16:30:05] <duch_kazatel> that’s totally fine :)
[16:30:12] <EminenceHC> Wondering why i haven't seen you before ;)
[16:30:24] <duch_kazatel> you were in here yesterday askivng questions iirc.
[16:30:44] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: My tip should have been when you asked for a fiddle and not a gist haha
[16:46:55] <Tomashe> Hey guys
[16:47:22] <Tomashe> wondering , if there is a way to trigger page movement using js
[16:47:31] <duch_kazatel> “trigger page movement” meaning what?
[16:47:33] <Tomashe> on jquery mobile
[16:47:50] <Tomashe> when i click on a link like href="#page1" it will do transittion to that page
[16:48:03] <Tomashe> i wanted to know if there is a way to grigger that
[16:48:26] <Tomashe> $("[href='#page3']"
[16:48:28] <duch_kazatel> a way to click links?
[16:48:48] <Tomashe> $("[href='#page3']").click();
[16:49:07] <duch_kazatel> $("a[href='#page3']").click(); should work, too.
[16:49:31] <Tomashe> hmm ok, about about jquery preloader
[16:49:39] <Tomashe> there is something like that ? for jquery mobile
[16:49:45] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:09:40] <FriendlySeal> helo frenz
[17:09:44] <FriendlySeal> o/

[17:10:35] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:10:47] <FriendlySeal> how can i make new MyClass
[17:11:03] <FriendlySeal> its teling its not a constructor
[17:11:10] <FriendlySeal> in c++ this i know how
[17:11:24] <FriendlySeal> but js doesnt have classes i thot
[17:11:29] <duch_kazatel> nope.  it doesn’t.
[17:11:38] <duch_kazatel> but you can create new objects using constructor functiuons.
[17:11:40] <duch_kazatel> *functions
[17:11:43] <FriendlySeal> yesyes
[17:11:55] <FriendlySeal> i made my first mmodule

[17:11:57] <FriendlySeal> define(['module'], function (module) {
[17:12:06] <FriendlySeal> then return {};
[17:12:15] <FriendlySeal> and inside return i have
[17:12:20] <FriendlySeal> round: function (x, l) {
[17:12:29] <duch_kazatel> FriendlySeal stop pasting code - do you have a fiddle?
[17:12:36] <FriendlySeal> so now i just want to add it so its a instance
[17:12:41] <FriendlySeal> or can be
[17:12:55] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to learn constructor functions?
[17:13:13] <FriendlySeal> just need to know how i can do this w js
[17:13:19] <FriendlySeal> like i do in c++
[17:13:35] <duch_kazatel> please provide a fiddle of your code.
[17:13:46] <FriendlySeal> no u dont need it
[17:13:52] <FriendlySeal> u have all info to help me
[17:13:57] <duch_kazatel> wtf.
[17:14:04] <duch_kazatel> you’re trying to do classes in a language that doesn;t.
[17:14:07] <FriendlySeal> just make a simple example
[17:14:08] <duch_kazatel> *doesn’t have them
[17:14:18] <FriendlySeal> well
[17:14:22] <duch_kazatel> http://pivotallabs.com/javascript-constructors-prototypes-and-the-new-keyword/
[17:14:23] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[17:14:31] <FriendlySeal> underscore jquery all can be NEWed
[17:14:39] <FriendlySeal> oh ok thx
[17:14:51] <duch_kazatel> sure - you need to learn what “new” does, because it’s not what you think.
[17:15:38] <FriendlySeal> ok ya this is a good post
[17:15:41] <FriendlySeal> nice colors
[17:53:04] <t0th_-> hi
[17:53:11] <t0th_-> jquery mobile?
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap?
[17:53:25] <duch_kazatel> ninjaface?
[17:53:27] <t0th_-> i have .listview('refresh') and is not work
[17:53:32] <t0th_-> can help me?
[17:53:35] <FriendlySeal> hi tooth
[17:54:10] <duch_kazatel> does your selector work?
[17:54:27] <t0th_-> works
[17:54:38] <t0th_-> i have a submit to other page
[17:54:41] <t0th_-> works first time
[17:54:54] <duch_kazatel> do you swap out the contents of the listview?
[17:54:55] <t0th_-> if i submit again, is not work... and not refresh my listview
[17:54:59] <duch_kazatel> like, the whople thing?
[17:55:29] <t0th_-> yes
[17:55:37] <t0th_-> in console i see my <li>
[17:55:45] <duch_kazatel> that’s why.  if you replace the entire listview, you need to re-init it.
[17:56:11] <duch_kazatel> OR do the smart think and only modify its contents.
[17:56:32] <FriendlySeal> so glad i make all my own components
[17:56:43] <duch_kazatel> so glad i don’t touch anything but jquery core.
[17:56:48] <duch_kazatel> ui and mobile are so weird.
[17:57:05] <t0th_-> how to reinit?
[17:57:14] <duch_kazatel> run .listview() on it again.
[17:57:25] <t0th_-> $('#myList').listview('refresh'); ?
[17:57:50] <t0th_-> how i can modify the contents?
[17:57:51] <duch_kazatel> you have the right data attributes on everything, right?
[17:58:28] <t0th_-> yes
[17:58:28] <duch_kazatel> only add/remove <li> (or whatever your individual items are)
[17:58:41] <duch_kazatel> without a code sample, i can’t really help any further.
[17:59:19] <t0th_-> pastebin
[17:59:21] <t0th_-> one minute
[17:59:24] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle please
[17:59:27] <duch_kazatel> a working example.
[17:59:32] <duch_kazatel> functioning, in jsfiddle
[18:00:10] <t0th_-> http://pastebin.com/JK1zmncx
[18:00:15] <t0th_-> ok
[18:00:40] <duch_kazatel> dude this -   $("#productsList").html($.trim(str)); that’s replacing everything.
[18:01:01] <FriendlySeal> i like mobile
[18:01:12] <t0th_-> $("#productsList").append($.trim(str)) ?
[18:01:16] <FriendlySeal> looks awesome
[18:01:29] <duch_kazatel> that’s a problem.
[18:02:54] <t0th_-> nothing
[18:03:26] <t0th_-> i replace and is not work
[18:03:37] <FriendlySeal> t0th_-, dood
[18:03:52] <duch_kazatel> i can’t really dig in further but it looks like you’re replacing EVERYTHING in the list, instead of adding/removing only the things you need.
[18:04:29] <FriendlySeal> console.log urshit
[18:07:57] <t0th_-> :(
[18:08:01] <t0th_-> thanks anyway
[18:09:10] <t0th_-> man
[18:09:17] <t0th_-> the problem is the refresh of listview
[18:09:33] <duch_kazatel> the problem is the way you’re updating the listview.
[18:09:54] <FriendlySeal> crimaty jacobs
[18:22:18] <t0th_-> duch_kazatel: what is the best way?
[18:22:26] <t0th_-> can give me an example?
[18:23:24] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8524884/adding-elements-to-listview-in-jquerymobile
[18:24:00] <t0th_-> thanks
[18:29:20] <t0th_-> i make same way
[18:30:27] <t0th_-> http://pastebin.com/421cRXnB
[18:30:32] <t0th_-> see if you can
[18:30:50] <duch_kazatel> t0th_- i all ready told you i don’t have time.
[18:31:02] <t0th_-> thanks anyway
[18:31:04] <tables> how can i send a json query to server and make it update a div with the reply's contents?
[18:31:13] <duch_kazatel> tables by using $.ajax();
[18:37:28] <tables> can you show me an example?
[18:39:05] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[18:39:13] <DarkGhost> anyone by chance elp me wiht a carousFredSel slider?
[18:39:19] <DarkGhost> i know no 3rd party but still
[18:42:31] <tables> i'm trying to download a page like say, http://www.google.com, and send it's html all to mydomain.com as an ajax call
[18:42:33] <tables> is this possible?
[18:43:33] <BillCriswell> tables: Not without some server side help, unless the domain CORS enables and you're whitelisted.
[18:50:36] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/UdzjR/1/    <-- how do i dump all the html of google.com to a div?
[18:51:10] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/UdzjR/2/
[18:54:57] <BillCriswell> tables: You can't do that.
[18:55:05] <BillCriswell> You would need a middle man.
[18:56:09] <BillCriswell> If you're requesting something from the domain the script is running on you can just do $('#dump').load('/local.html')
[18:56:58] <GoSox> is there a way to disabled javascript in a frame, so if you load content into it, no javascript on that framed page will run?
[18:57:01] <tables> i'm checking http headers and it does do the request
[18:57:03] <tables> BillCriswell, ^
[18:57:10] <tables> how do i put the full html contents in a variable?
[18:58:00] <BillCriswell> tables: If you're saying you can get it $('#dump').load('http://www.google.com') should do the trick.
[18:59:30] <tables> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/UdzjR/3/   why won't it dump?
[18:59:55] <BillCriswell> It's an iframe.
[19:00:29] <BillCriswell> tables: The actual source is jshell.net
[19:01:03] <tables> jshell.net won't work either
[19:03:47] <BillCriswell> Yes it does.
[19:07:54] <FriendlySeal> git puuuuuul
[19:07:57] <FriendlySeal> :D
[19:10:20] <lianzinho> guys, i have a anchor tag which is sending to the link besides me using e.preventDefault() what could be wrong?
[19:10:45] <Velveeta> usually when i see that, it's because an error is being thrown somewhere
[19:11:08] <lianzinho> I get this all the time...
[19:11:11] <lianzinho> event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[19:11:21] <Velveeta> that's a chrome issue
[19:11:24] <lianzinho> but I don't know what this mean
[19:11:57] <Velveeta> it's just chrome changing some internal implementation and throwing a warning because jquery is using the thing that changed
[19:12:02] <lianzinho> what could be done? it's a very simple call… I'm just testing a link…
[19:12:07] <Velveeta> it should be resolved in 1.11
[19:12:18] <FriendlySeal> pull my finger
[19:12:30] <Velveeta> but that's not an error that would cause preventDefault from working properly
[19:12:52] <Velveeta> put up a demo of your code and i'll see if i spot anything obvious in it
[19:13:18] <lianzinho> man… it is really simple… will make a little fiddle
[19:13:37] <Velveeta> that's fine
[19:13:45] <Velveeta> that should make it easy on you
[19:15:29] <lianzinho> http://jsfiddle.net/halianlian/LRafn/
[19:15:34] <lianzinho> in the fiddle it works...
[19:15:55] <lianzinho> I have exactly the same code in my site...
[19:15:56] <Velveeta> then something must be going on external to that code, in your other code
[19:16:23] <Velveeta> is the actual url something you can share?
[19:16:29] <lianzinho> but no error is thrown at all… any tactics to spot?
[19:16:54] <Velveeta> you can set a breakpoint in your click handler and make sure it's being triggered
[19:19:47] <lianzinho> Velveeta: in the html?
[19:19:59] <Velveeta> in the javascript
[19:21:13] <BillCriswell> tables: http://jsfiddle.net/2CgRR/
[19:23:34] <lianzinho> Velveeta: in the line of the .click() call ?
[19:23:57] <Velveeta> inside of the click function itself
[19:25:17] <lianzinho> yeah, it's not firing.. when I click, it follows the link
[19:25:45] <Velveeta> then something else is causing your page before it ever hits your click event
[19:25:53] <lianzinho> maybe has something to do with where it is in the code
[19:25:59] <Velveeta> and there are no errors being thrown?
[19:26:08] <lianzinho> its in the same file as an ajax call
[19:26:12] <lianzinho> will send a paste
[19:26:43] <Velveeta> a paste isn't gonna help me, i need to see a live recreation of the error to debug it
[19:27:18] <tables> BillCriswell, http://jsfiddle.net/LQRcY/2/        <-- it works good like that, how do i put all the html contents as 1 urlencoded query to mysite.com like:  mysite.com?query=HELLOWORLDSTUFFHERE
[19:27:52] <foo> https://kaptureaudio.com/ - see the highlighted txt text on the top changing, any idea what that is?
[19:27:58] <BillCriswell> You've lost me.
[19:28:01] <tables> instead of sending to 'summary', i want it to make a request to my site and then dump that content, i'm guessing do 2 loads
[19:28:10] <tables> ok step by step:
[19:28:42] <tables> 1. put in a variable:     $('#summary').load('http://fiddle.jshell.net/svp7U/show/');
[19:28:54] <Velveeta> foo: it's a style span
[19:28:57] <Velveeta> styled*
[19:28:58] <tables> (in the variable, put all the HTML code)
[19:29:43] <tables> then 2. as an urlencoded request, make another .load like :            $('#new').load('http://mysite.com/q=HELLOWORLDHTMLSTUFFHERE');
[19:29:56] <lianzinho> Velveeta: here you go: http://www.grioproducoes.com.br/fotos-e-videos/
[19:29:59] <lianzinho> click Videos
[19:30:03] <tables> http://mysite.com/q=HELLOWORLDURLENCODEDHTMLREQUEST
[19:30:11] <Velveeta> ok
[19:30:14] <lianzinho> then click any of the thumbnails
[19:30:21] <tables> <div id="new"></div> should show all the contents of that new query
[19:30:23] <BillCriswell> tables: Why are you passing that query to the site?
[19:30:30] <tables> that whole html query?
[19:30:32] <tables> just because
[19:30:36] <tables> i wanna work with it as raw html
[19:30:53] <Velveeta> lianzinho: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'hasAttribute' of null
[19:30:59] <BillCriswell> What's the point of making a request?
[19:31:09] <lianzinho> Velveeta: where?
[19:31:27] <Velveeta> actually that's coming from the next page that's loading
[19:31:41] <BillCriswell> $('#summary').html('<p><strong>Hello World</strong></p>') can do what you want.
[19:31:52] <lianzinho> the next page is youtube!
[19:31:53] <lianzinho> hehehe
[19:32:07] <BillCriswell> No reason to make a request just to return some static HTML.
[19:32:37] <lianzinho> Velveeta: and I cannot see it..
[19:33:00] <Velveeta> it's coming from a document.body.hasAttribute call
[19:33:10] <Velveeta> but i'm not sure if that's the error that's causing this initially
[19:34:27] <lianzinho> Velveeta: are you using chrome? this error does not show to me at all… is that thrown when you click?
[19:35:26] <Velveeta> yes i'm using chrome, but like i said, i think that's on the next page that's loading, i don't know that that's what's causing the this to fail
[19:38:14] <lianzinho> Velveeta: but the next page being youtube, shouldn't it be a youtube error?
[19:39:05] <Velveeta> yes.. calm down and stop worrying about that error :D
[19:39:24] <lianzinho> Velveeta: look...
[19:39:31] <lianzinho> I had an idea
[19:39:45] <lianzinho> I guess, because of the ajax
[19:39:53] <lianzinho> the event is not being assigned
[19:40:08] <lianzinho> the <a> it is loaded after the script
[19:40:12] <Velveeta> oh, here's your problem
[19:40:18] <Velveeta> yeah, that's exactly what's going on
[19:40:20] <lianzinho> I guess I have to use on
[19:40:22] <Velveeta> you need to use event delegation
[19:40:22] <lianzinho> hehehehe
[19:41:09] <lianzinho> man… spent the whole morning trying to debug a plugin, which was not working
[19:41:10] <lianzinho> hahahaha
[19:41:14] <lianzinho> sucks!
[19:41:28] <lianzinho> I don't like the syntax of the new event delegation
[19:41:59] <lianzinho> its .on('click',<parent>, function(){})  ??
[19:42:05] <Velveeta> i love it, it consolidates all of the old functions into 1
[19:42:31] <lianzinho> but I find it a little bit counter intuitive...
[19:42:45] <lianzinho> the second argument should be the parent of the element I want to delegate?
[19:42:49] <Velveeta> how so?
[19:42:54] <Velveeta> no
[19:43:09] <Velveeta> the 2nd argument is the element you want to target
[19:43:16] <Velveeta> you chain it off of the parent
[19:43:29] <Velveeta> $(parent).on('click', 'selector', function)
[19:43:35] <lianzinho> ah… that's it
[19:43:36] <lianzinho> see
[19:43:40] <lianzinho> counter intuitive
[19:43:44] <lianzinho> hahaha
[19:43:49] <lianzinho> I never remember this
[19:43:54] <Velveeta> you're delegating that listener *for* another element
[19:43:59] <lianzinho> it will bubble up from the parent
[19:44:04] <Velveeta> so you delegate to the parent
[19:44:05] <lianzinho> till the target
[19:44:08] <lianzinho> yes?
[19:44:12] <Velveeta> no, it bubbles up *to* the parent
[19:44:18] <Velveeta> *from* the target
[19:44:20] <lianzinho> yes
[19:44:31] <lianzinho> that what I tried to say
[19:44:32] <lianzinho> :D
[19:44:48] <Velveeta> but you're binding the listener to the parent, so you attach to the parent with .on
[19:45:06] <Velveeta> you're just telling it to fire for any elements matching 'selector', so you pass selector as a parameter to it
[19:47:02] <Velveeta> just think of it like this: $(container).on('event' *from* 'optional selector' *do* callback)
[19:49:46] <lianzinho> Velveeta: still not working… :P
[19:50:33] <lianzinho> Velveeta: you pass just the name of the selector? or the full stuff ?
[19:50:43] <lianzinho> .open or just open ?
[19:50:55] <Velveeta> the full selector: .open
[19:51:19] <Velveeta> does .servico exist at the time the document loads, or is it pulled in via ajax?
[19:52:21] <lianzinho> ah… it's pulled too… stupid… it has to be the most parent ...
[19:52:31] <lianzinho> the grand grand grandfather
[19:52:32] <lianzinho> hehehehe
[19:52:33] <Velveeta> it has to be something that actually exists
[19:52:45] <Velveeta> it could be a great grandparent, or even just the $(document) node itself
[19:53:11] <lianzinho> it makes any kind of performance issue?
[19:53:20] <lianzinho> the distance between the parent and the element?
[19:53:29] <Velveeta> possibly, but not enough to notice that i've ever seen
[19:53:31] <lianzinho> bubbling too much up ?
[19:53:34] <Velveeta> nah
[19:53:35] <lianzinho> ok
[19:53:41] <Velveeta> those things bubble up in the blink of an eye
[19:56:45] <vinex08> yoh guys, im trying to experiment something here http://jsfiddle.net/9w4Vm/   Q1: how can i change the + text into - when toggled? Q2: I only want 1 panel to appear per toggle? what method should i use?
[20:00:33] <lianzinho> Velveeta: that's it… all working now! Thanks a lot man...
[20:00:44] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[20:07:58] <foo> Velveeta: gah, little slow. So a style span. Is that was is causing the animation, though?
[20:08:19] <lianzinho> Velveeta: funny… it does not launch the lightbox the first time I click… as if it has to clean up something up to bind the next event
[20:08:39] <Velveeta> foo: it's a javascript animation, it's just adding an empty span tag at the end of that text, and then moving 1 character at a time into it from the end of the string, so it looks like it's highlighting backwards
[20:09:50] <Velveeta> lianzinho: i don't see that you're doing anything other than console.logging something in that click event
[20:10:06] <lianzinho> it's not live yet
[20:10:10] <lianzinho> wait a moment
[20:11:27] <Velveeta> lianzinho: i'm assuming that magnificentPopup plugin is just setting up the plugin to fire on click, meaning it doesn't get set up until you click on the element, and then you have to click again to activate the popup
[20:11:28] <lianzinho> Velveeta: now… click once, nothing, click again… modal
[20:11:53] <Velveeta> you should be firing the magnificentPopup function after injecting the content, to set it up immediately
[20:12:07] <Velveeta> and then just have your .on() handler preventDefault on the anchor
[20:15:25] <lianzinho> Velveeta: nice, I set it in the ajax success
[20:15:34] <lianzinho> now it works flawlessly
[20:15:39] <Velveeta> :)
[20:16:14] <lianzinho> Velveeta: but it the user change tabs… it will reset all the times? hehehe
[20:17:46] <Velveeta> if changing tabs triggers that content load, sure
[20:18:56] <TheJHNZ> does jquery detect a placeholder as a value ?
[20:19:22] <lianzinho> Velveeta: yes it will go back and forth with the ajax in each tab.
[20:19:43] <lianzinho> well… nice then, gotta keep going, still have to configure the gallery
[20:19:49] <lianzinho> thanks again!
[20:19:58] <Velveeta> no problem, good luck
[20:20:23] <lianzinho> TheJHNZ: you mean, the HTML5 placeholder attribute?
[20:20:34] <TheJHNZ> indeed
[20:20:44] <Velveeta> if you do something like this in a selector? [placeholder]
[20:20:48] <Velveeta> yes
[20:20:54] <TheJHNZ> var email = $('#email').val();
[20:21:00] <Velveeta> ah, no
[20:21:05] <TheJHNZ> #email is a input form
[20:21:13] <Velveeta> placeholders aren't part of an element's value
[20:21:18] <TheJHNZ> i see
[20:21:27] <TheJHNZ> whats the best way of dumping whats in a var ?
[20:21:35] <Velveeta> console.log(var) ?
[20:21:49] <Velveeta> or do you mean scrapping what's in a var?
[20:21:55] <TheJHNZ> hmm its returning undefined
[20:22:11] <TheJHNZ> <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="you@something.com" />
[20:22:15] <TheJHNZ> trying to grab whats in here
[20:22:29] <Velveeta> trying to grab what's in where exactly?
[20:22:40] <TheJHNZ> an input field
[20:22:42] <TheJHNZ> in a form
[20:22:53] <Velveeta> right, the value? or the placeholder? specifics..
[20:22:57] <TheJHNZ> value sorry
[20:23:09] <Velveeta> $([name="email"]).val()
[20:23:58] <TheJHNZ> i.nodeName is undefined
[20:24:12] <Velveeta> oh whoops, put that in a string
[20:24:17] <Velveeta> $('[name="email"]').val()
[20:24:33] <TheJHNZ> cheers \o/
[20:25:23] <TheJHNZ> lol whoops, keeep thinking + is .
[20:25:58] <TheJHNZ> to much php :-)
[20:26:12] <Velveeta> heheh
[20:27:28] <TheJHNZ> now to make it check if its a valid email
[20:38:43] <foo> Velveeta: gotcha, thanks!
[20:39:57] <mehwork> how come when i $(document).on('tap', '#cancel', function() { alert('test'); } it does the alert when i hit the cancel button, as expected, but then it also alerts again when i touch anywhere on the entire screen?
[20:41:36] <Uhkis> well that's what your code says
[20:41:45] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/Cfub7/1/           <-- how do i put the input form value in a jquery variable on submit?
[20:44:06] <TheJHNZ> var query - $([name="query"]).val()
[20:44:10] <TheJHNZ> var query = $([name="query"]).val()
[20:44:46] <vinex08> yoh guys, im trying to experiment something here http://jsfiddle.net/9w4Vm/   Q1: how can i change the + text into - when toggled? Q2: I only want 1 panel to appear per toggle? what method should i use?
[20:45:45] <mehwork> Uhkis: yeah but is there a common reason that happens? I even tried evt.stopImmediatePropagation() and friends
[20:47:23] <Uhkis> mehwork: i think you want something like $('button').on('tap', '#cancel' ....
[20:49:31] <tables> TheJHNZ, how do i print var query in a div with id="lol" ?

[20:56:38] <tables> i wanna click submit and just print the contents out in the div
[21:06:21] <mehwork> tables: jsfiddle doesn't like form submissions
[21:06:46] <mehwork> but basically you need an on .submit() handler and to print the value of #lol
[21:19:53] <NBhosting> how do i do this reversed? $('div.message').each(function(){

[21:38:50] <oojacoboo> hey guys, I'm using wrap() but it's triggering a blur event on an input which is firing another event I need to listen on for blur
[21:39:03] <oojacoboo> anyone seen anything like this or have any suggestions?
[21:44:19] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/Cfub7/9/   <-- how do i urlencode my_var and send it correctly again?
[21:46:53] <tables> i want the whole json request as one variable and sent as urlencoded
[21:47:29] <TheJHNZ> $(this).
[21:47:32] <TheJHNZ> is this right ?
[21:51:46] <Uhkis> TheJHNZ: yes
[21:52:12] <TheJHNZ> \o/
[21:52:17] <TheJHNZ> $('[name="efield"]').removeClass('animated shake').addClass('animated shake');
[21:52:29] <TheJHNZ> trying to do this, but i think it needs a slight delay between remove and add
[21:52:49] <vinex08> eq(1) <--- similar to arrays? if im not mistaken
[22:03:15] <TheJHNZ> ?
[22:03:17] <TheJHNZ> anyone know
[22:06:50] <TheJHNZ> is there a way to do something after a click
[22:07:47] <Uhkis> TheJHNZ: i think you need to do something like setTimeout(function(){$('[name="efield"]').addClass('animated shake');},1000); after that removeclass
[22:09:33] <TheJHNZ> thanks mate
[22:10:36] <vinex08> can anyone suggest a mini jquery effect for me to create?? I'm still learning basic jQuery :)
[22:10:40] <TheJHNZ> got it \o/
[22:11:43] <andromedian> vinex08, http://try.jquery.com/
[22:11:51] <raj> If I run a jquery plugin on an element and I clone the parent element, any way I can maintain the executed plugin as is on the cloned item?
[22:25:12] <vinex08> thanks andromedian
[22:28:06] <BrazenBraden> morning y'all
[22:28:09] <Uhkis> this jquery game is fun :-D
[22:30:56] <GoSox> what is the exact syntax for using a real function as a callback function, instead of doing an anonymous function?
[22:31:22] <GoSox> do you do "function", "function()", function(), function ?
[22:31:48] <BrazenBraden> Got a little question.. I have a function which is basically an alias for $.load(). I would like to reference the div in it as $(this). How could I do that? This is the code: https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/46ba8d0cea0bbd838497
[22:32:35] <Uhkis> GoSox: just replace the anonymous function with your function name
[22:32:56] <GoSox> Uhkis: yes see my previous message, what is the proper syntax?
[22:34:47] <Uhkis> function()
[22:39:28] <AliG1000> I have a couple of problems with this: http://jsfiddle.net/k9gCA/2/
[22:41:04] <AliG1000> a) I should be using on() but I can't get the syntax right and b) it doesn't work on JSFiddle although it is a little better on my own server and c) it doesn't work :)
[22:42:49] <BrazenBraden> AliG1000: "$(this).parents("tr").attr("data-messageid")" should just be "$(this).parents("tr").data('messageid')" for one
[22:43:19] <AliG1000> really?  let me check...
[22:44:37] <BrazenBraden> AliG1000: something like http://jsfiddle.net/k9gCA/3/
[22:45:13] <AliG1000> are you sure about the 'messageid'?  it looks OK to me
[22:45:56] <BrazenBraden> thats he name of your "data"
[22:46:18] <BrazenBraden> "data-messageid=1"
[22:46:31] <BrazenBraden> .data('messageid') = 1
[22:47:01] <AliG1000> I tried you fiddle and it didn't work for me
[22:49:26] <BrazenBraden> AliG1000: yours dont work for me either
[22:49:32] <AliG1000> snap :)
[22:49:40] <BrazenBraden> you missing the .inbox-content .view-message elements
[22:50:05] <AliG1000> this is the weird bit.  on the page I am using, this works
[22:50:24] <GoSox> ok so this isn't working, anyone know what the correct syntax is for referencing a user defined function as a callback?
[22:50:25] <AliG1000> but I can't work out why (jQuery is not my strong suit)
[22:50:29] <GoSox> $("#geoipform").focus( clean_error() );
[22:51:48] <AliG1000> does your fiddle work?  maybe I am doing something wrong
[22:53:24] <BrazenBraden> AliG1000: one sex. fixing it
[22:53:34] <GoSox> mmm sex
[22:54:07] <BrazenBraden> AliG1000: try this
[22:54:11] <BrazenBraden> http://jsfiddle.net/k9gCA/4/
[22:56:41] <AliG1000> cool - that worked.  I will try and integrate it into my page...
[22:57:36] <Uhkis> GoSox: apparently you have to wrap it in function({});
[22:57:49] <GoSox> this works:
[22:57:49] <GoSox> $("#geoipinput").focus( clean_error );
[22:58:00] <GoSox> the function name, without parenthesis, and not quoted as a string
