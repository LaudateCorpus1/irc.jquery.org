[00:01:24] <xec_> google is pretty informed :)
[00:10:29] <coldhead> pif: this one doesn't get too many gomblaints http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[00:10:32] <coldhead> and it's on github
[00:10:38] <coldhead> so it's (potentially) still alive
[00:10:43] <pif> ok!
[00:20:09] <knickabocka> this channel supports jquery mobile too?
[00:23:17] <Whirl3d> Evenin' all. Any idea why I would get several 404 errors when loading a page fragment (for missing imgs) but then none of the loaded page fragment shows up in the div into which it was loaded?
[00:23:48] <coldhead> sure does, knickabocka
[00:23:56] <Whirl3d> I expected the 404 errors, in fact thought that verified the content was loading. But then I look at the div where the rest of the content should be and ....nothing.
[00:24:07] <coldhead> oh wait, #jQuerymobile knickabocka
[00:30:06] <Whirl3d> I hate to pester, but I can't figure out why console would show 404 errors for images thatcould only come from content I had successfully loaded using .load, yet nothing shows up?
[00:32:42] <Whirl3d> harsh
[00:44:01] <coldhead> its the witching hour here, Whirl3d
[00:44:07] <coldhead> don't take it personal
[00:44:18] <coldhead> some of us are very busy flirting with cow orkers
[00:44:53] <coldhead> ?demo @ Whirl3d
[00:44:53] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:46:00] <Whirl3d> coldhead, thanks for the reply. I decided to just append the response text to a hidden div and copy over the content I wanted. It works now. I just thought I could load just a fragment..no luck
[00:47:43] <coldhead> yeah i would have that it worked with fragments
[00:51:14] <coldhead> thought that*
[00:51:16] <coldhead> god help me
[01:27:53] <ShishKabab> Hi. I love using jQuery, but could anyone explain me the reason why Ctrl + Tab is overridden in the jQuery docs? It never fails to annoy me :)
[01:37:14] <PavelloZ> well, it works as intended for me
[01:37:21] <PavelloZ> switching browser's tab
[02:00:24] <itatitat> ey guys
[02:00:40] <itatitat> when I select an option from a drop down list
[02:00:57] <itatitat> the attribute select=true is added automatic?
[02:01:16] <itatitat> sorry, "selected"
[02:02:38] <Cork> no
[02:02:46] <itatitat> ah, ok
[02:02:55] <itatitat> maybe is that, im fighting with a list
[02:02:57] <Cork> selected is what you set in html when you generate the select box
[02:03:09] <Cork> its never updated
[02:03:16] <Cork> and it doens't even have to exist
[02:05:12] <itatitat> but..........I dont need to write this property in all the options no?
[02:05:37] <Cork> no
[02:05:45] <Cork> its not needed at all
[02:05:56] <itatitat> ah okok, is because I've a problem...
[02:06:00] <Cork> if no option has selected, the first in the list is selected
[02:06:26] <itatitat> when I select an option, I use AJAx to show information about the option selected
[02:07:15] <itatitat> the problem is that...when I make click again to select another option, ajax start before I select a new option
[02:07:16] <itatitat> ....
[02:07:19] <itatitat> I dont understand
[02:07:46] <Cork> ya, click happens before the element has changed its value
[02:08:02] <itatitat> jummmmmmmmmmmmm, so I need to use another event?
[02:08:09] <Cork> change
[02:08:14] <itatitat> ou....
[02:08:18] <itatitat> ok,. I'll try
[02:10:02] <itatitat> aaaaaaaaah
[02:10:03] <itatitat> ok
[02:10:10] <itatitat> I know what is my error
[02:10:23] <itatitat> Im binding change with the field option
[02:10:30] <Cork> :)
[02:10:37] <itatitat> I think I must bind the field select with change
[02:10:40] <itatitat> not option
[02:10:42] <itatitat> maybe is that?
[02:10:43] <Cork> correct
[02:10:48] <itatitat> ooooh dear
[02:11:08] <Cork> selectbox.val() == the value of the option
[02:11:31] <Cork> or in the change event $(this).val()
[02:11:49] <fotoflo> mmm.  I have a  <div><p>text</p></div> and i am using jquery UI to position it and the DIV is getting positioned, but the text in the p is not where it should be
[02:12:19] <fotoflo> anyone seen this kind of thing
[02:12:20] <fotoflo> ?
[02:12:28] <fotoflo> (before)
[02:13:37] <fotoflo> â€¦ I asked too soon. just started experimenting with the css position, it must be manually set to absolute
[02:15:48] <Cork> fotoflo: you need to give more info then that, a demo or a link is needed
[02:15:55] <Cork> ?demo
[02:15:55] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:16:11] <fotoflo> Cork:  already fixed the problem...
[02:16:32] <Cork> ok, then remember it for the next question instead :)
[02:16:51] <fotoflo> ok :-)
[02:39:48] <NaN> how can I delete the text in a textarea after an ajax call? i'm using val = "" but isn't working - simple example http://jsfiddle.net/X7Jcn/
[02:40:49] <Hooloovoo> NaN: http://jsfiddle.net/X7Jcn/1/
[02:41:33] <NaN> Hooloovoo: sweet, thanks dude!
[02:41:42] <Hooloovoo> NaN: np =)
[02:42:25] <NaN> is there any difference if I use text() instead html()?
[02:45:55] <Hooloovoo> NaN: yup, i think text() is safer to use
[02:45:59] <Hooloovoo> it escapes and stuff
[02:46:09] <Hooloovoo> check the documentation, but i think that's the difference.
[02:49:14] <NaN> Hooloovoo: I was talking about your example for cleaning the textarea, but thanks anyway =)
[02:49:46] <Hooloovoo> NaN: oh. nope. there's no difference.
[02:49:54] <Hooloovoo> should do exactly the same.
[02:51:19] <NaN> Hooloovoo: nice, thanks again man
[02:55:11] <aqeel> hi room
[02:56:29] <Hooloovoo> hi aqeel
[02:56:48] <aqeel> why is room so quite today
[02:56:53] <NaN> Hooloovoo: can you please check this out? > http://jsfiddle.net/X7Jcn/2/
[02:58:54] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/X7Jcn/3/
[02:58:59] <aqeel> NaN
[03:00:36] <Hooloovoo> NaN: works fine for me
[03:01:40] <NaN> Hooloovoo: so you can change the text and clear it with the button?
[03:01:53] <aqeel> yes?
[03:02:02] <Hooloovoo> yup
[03:02:20] <aqeel> that is what javascript id for....dynamic changes
[03:02:20] <Hooloovoo> ohhhh nope
[03:02:22] <Hooloovoo> wait
[03:02:30] <aqeel> is*
[03:03:39] <Hooloovoo> NaN: http://jsfiddle.net/X7Jcn/4/
[03:04:37] <Hooloovoo> NaN: when you enter the value again it enters as val, not html.
[03:05:01] <NaN> mmm interesing... how do you came to that conclusion?
[03:05:14] <NaN> but then why clean the html first and next the val?
[03:05:41] <NaN> I mean, that was to tricky for me
[03:05:53] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/X7Jcn/5/
[03:06:23] <Hooloovoo> aqeel: that's a horrible solution
[03:07:00] <aqeel> well i don not the question in first place...but what he wants is my guess
[03:07:03] <Hooloovoo> NaN: well, when you enter the value of textarea in the HTML directly it's set as html content of the textarea tag. when you edit it with the browser it's input as value on the textarea tag
[03:07:19] <Hooloovoo> aqeel: hmm, yea could be.
[03:09:00] <aqeel> ok got to go....
[03:09:03] <aqeel> bye room
[03:09:10] <aqeel> have nice coding...
[03:09:57] <NaN> Hooloovoo: then suppose that my textarea begin blank, then I add text, make an ajax call and want to clean it... do I still have to chain the html?
[03:11:06] <Hooloovoo> no
[03:11:10] <Hooloovoo> i don't think so
[03:11:18] <Hooloovoo> anyways, lunch! bbl.
[03:11:27] <NaN> Hooloovoo: yep, you was right!
[03:11:33] <NaN> thanks dude
[03:14:17] <fotoflo> hmm, how do i get something like  "a123b456".match("[0-9]+") to return [123, 456]
[03:16:19] <lijzzz> Haaaai guys
[03:19:54] <lijzzz> haaai
[03:20:10] <lijzzz> i have a doubt with onblur button click jquery
[03:20:37] <lijzzz> here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/
[03:21:14] <lijzzz> any jquery tech gigs
[03:21:49] <quicksilver> lijzzz: surely you meant setTimeout(function(){imgsave.click()},240);
[03:22:00] <lijzzz> that is not correct
[03:22:28] <lijzzz> i dont want the blur function to execute first if the user clicks on button
[03:22:46] <quicksilver> my point is that your setTimeout is currently useless
[03:22:49] <quicksilver> nothing happens in 250ms.
[03:22:56] <quicksilver> instead .click() gets called immediately on blur
[03:23:02] <lijzzz> ya it simply executes the button click
[03:23:17] <lijzzz> i dont know the syntax of jquery which need to be used here
[03:24:00] <lijzzz> quicksilver, wat is the best way to do this
[03:25:50] <Trisox> wy not make a function and call that in the end of your ajax call
[03:27:34] <lijzzz> but i want to pass the id in the click function of  span
[03:28:25] <Trisox> so?
[03:29:25] <lijzzz> actually it is a datalist type of control which displays several photos in a page
[03:29:52] <lijzzz> i want the title of each photo to be edited when they click on that title
[03:30:18] <lijzzz> when they click on the title a button and a textbox wil appear and the user can save that to db
[03:31:12] <raj> Cork, do you realize how crazy this channel has been without you the last few days?
[03:32:40] <lijzzz> when the textbox appears i am applying an onblur. since i have a button also there, the onblur is executing first which is preventing the button click
[03:33:44] <lijzzz> Trisox,
[03:36:12] <lijzzz> ):
[03:36:58] <lijzzz> haai
[03:37:01] <lijzzz> anyone
[03:37:11] <lijzzz> trisox
[03:37:12] <caniuse> lijzzz: no IN YOUR FACE!!!
[03:37:25] <lijzzz> soup
[03:38:07] <sqwk> why does this produce a 'cannot get left of null error: http://pastie.org/3761142
[03:38:13] <sqwk> using query ui slider
[03:38:27] <nFFF> lijzzz I don't understand your code
[03:38:40] <lijzzz> it is simple code nff
[03:38:44] <lijzzz> nff
[03:38:50] <nFFF> setTimeout(imgsave.click(),250); // whats this meant to do?
[03:39:00] <nFFF> surely you want ?trigger
[03:39:05] <nFFF> ?trigger
[03:39:06] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[03:39:08] <lijzzz> i actually want to escape from the blur event
[03:39:23] <nFFF> imgsave.trigger('click');
[03:40:02] <nFFF> plus you'll want to wrap it in an anon #function so it doesn't get executed on apge load
[03:40:02] <lijzzz> nfff here is my case, i have textbox on blur as well as button click
[03:40:29] <lijzzz> how come that will execute on page loaad
[03:40:40] <lijzzz> i have called the whole function on a span click
[03:41:39] <lijzzz> nfff
[03:41:56] <nFFF> Ok one second, I didnt follow your code properly
[03:42:16] <lijzzz> nfff, i dont want the blur function to be executed when the user clicks on the button
[03:42:39] <nFFF> so why is it in the callback then?
[03:42:58] <lijzzz> i dont know where to put that code
[03:43:00] <Endy> Hi, a problem with UI icons. Whenever you put an icon with "ui-state-x" class on a container with "ui-widget-content" class the icons break, anyone know a workaround to this ? Apparently the background setting on "ui-widget-content" breaks it.
[03:43:03] <lijzzz> actually it is wrong
[03:43:17] <nFFF> I dont understand your code or what you are even trying to achieve, sorry
[03:43:40] <lijzzz> nff, simple i have a list of photos displayed in a page
[03:43:55] <lijzzz> i hav a title associated with each picture
[03:44:04] <lijzzz> i want the user to edit that title
[03:44:27] <nFFF> ok
[03:44:35] <lijzzz> when he clicks on the span which displays the title, it hides the span and shows the textbox and save button
[03:45:01] <nFFF> ok
[03:45:03] <lijzzz> so i want the span to be displayed when an onblur occurs on the textbox
[03:45:29] <lijzzz> and i want to save the data ebtered on the text box if he clicks on the save button
[03:45:59] <lijzzz> so i started with the span click event
[03:46:13] <Endy> lijzzz I did such an 'edit in place' implementation not long ago, what's your problem ?
[03:46:50] <lijzzz> i have problem like my blur is executing first when the user clicks on the button
[03:47:07] <lijzzz> and it is not making the ajax call
[03:47:25] <lijzzz> called on the button click event
[03:47:35] <Endy> Why the blur ? What I did is either user saves, clicks cancel or presses esc
[03:47:55] <lijzzz> blur is the custome req
[03:48:06] <Endy> Ahh, I see :)
[03:48:10] <Endy> Stupid customers .)
[03:48:14] <lijzzz> :)
[03:48:42] <lijzzz> nFFF hope u understand the issue
[03:48:50] <Endy> Well I'd assume the blur is called when the users clicks the button, yes ?
[03:48:58] <lijzzz> yaa
[03:49:16] <lijzzz> there should be some way to make the blur wait
[03:49:52] <Endy> delay() ? :)
[03:50:06] <lijzzz> donno exactly
[03:50:10] <Endy> Just override the blur event and add that with some value
[03:50:16] <lijzzz> i have seen some code like this in some website
[03:50:18] <lijzzz> onBlur: function() {             this.blurTimeOut = setTimeout(util.bind(this.cancel, this), 250);
[03:50:45] <lijzzz> from that i tried my code
[03:50:51] <lijzzz> but seems like useles
[03:50:53] <Endy> No need to make it overly complex
[03:50:59] <Endy> And obfuscate intent
[03:51:11] <Endy> Just add a delay and start building from there
[03:51:33] <nFFF> lijzzz, Do you control the markup?
[03:51:36] <lijzzz> if i add delay it wil delay the blur event and button click event wil execute first or wat
[03:51:41] <nFFF> can you add a sample markup to the fiddle
[03:51:43] <lijzzz> nFF i do
[03:51:52] <Endy> Delay the blur and run the click first
[03:52:06] <Endy> They're separate events
[03:52:08] <nFFF> I have a feeling all this could be re-written a lot better
[03:52:30] <lijzzz> nFF it contains MVC stuff
[03:52:31] <Endy> Now plz: Hi, a problem with UI icons. Whenever you put an icon with "ui-state-x" class on a container with "ui-widget-content" class the icons break, anyone know a workaround to this ? Apparently the background setting on "ui-widget-content" breaks it.
[03:53:06] <nFFF> lijzzz, just the markup of album-view text and associated elements in the click event
[03:53:37] <Endy> Ie, <div class="ui-widget"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-foo ui-state-default"></span></div> works, <div class="ui-widget ui-widget-content"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-foo ui-state-default"></span></div> does not
[03:53:38] <lijzzz> nff i have updated
[03:54:51] <nFFF> ok I dont see your #text #img #spn_ elements?
[03:55:00] <JCBK> hey
[03:55:05] <JCBK> what's going wrong hereâ€¦? http://jsfiddle.net/tRDba/
[03:55:11] <lijzzz> nff 1 sec
[03:55:16] <lijzzz> it has not updated
[03:56:45] <Endy> jcbk try find('span') instead of children
[03:57:05] <lijzzz> nff can u see the updated one
[03:57:44] <lijzzz> if u want i can paste it here
[03:58:00] <nFFF> JCBK
[03:58:01] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/tRDba/2/
[03:58:06] <nFFF> children works fine
[03:58:15] <lijzzz> <div class="txt-hold"> <input onfocus="this.value = this.value;" tabindex="1" id="@aid" class="albumview-text" value="@photo.Name"                                      title="Click to edit" style="display: none;"/> <img id="@imgid" alt=""  title="save changes" class="btn-save" style="display: none;"/> <span class="albumview-text" id="@spnid" title="Click to edit">@photo.Name</span> <input type="hidden" id="@hdnid" value='@Url.RouteUr
[03:58:34] <JCBK> nFFF thanks
[03:58:38] <JCBK> was just a syntax error yeah?
[03:58:57] <nFFF> yea there was a few issues
[03:59:02] <nFFF> you even spealt grey wrong :>
[03:59:20] <nFFF> lijzzz, see what? you ahvenht given me a url
[03:59:33] <lijzzz> http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/4/
[03:59:47] <nFFF> ok that has no html
[03:59:58] <lijzzz> i have put in script section
[04:00:05] <nFFF> why?
[04:00:33] <JCBK> nFFF i should really start using Spiffing CSS ;) http://spiffingcss.com/
[04:01:10] <lijzzz> nff it was not updating when i put it in html section
[04:02:04] <lijzzz> nff here is the latest one
[04:02:05] <lijzzz> http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/7/
[04:02:30] <nFFF> cool
[04:02:35] <nFFF> ok I dont see your #text #img #spn_ elements?
[04:02:53] <lijzzz> nff it is just dynamic variables
[04:03:13] <nFFF> I dont follow
[04:03:17] <lijzzz> u know mvc right?
[04:03:35] <lijzzz> u see this link http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/7/
[04:03:51] <nFFF> as in model view controller
[04:04:07] <Endy> I can't see where #hdn_ is pointing eihter, re: ajax won't fire
[04:04:14] <lijzzz> yes right
[04:04:31] <nFFF> but whats the got to do with: var spn = $('#spn_' + element[1] + '');
[04:04:39] <nFFF> theres no #spn_ element on your apge
[04:04:48] <nFFF> what is this selector suppose to select??
[04:05:16] <lijzzz> nff check the id os the span element
[04:05:45] <lijzzz> <span class="albumview-text" id="@spnid" title="Click to edit">@photo.Name</span>
[04:05:55] <lijzzz> var spnid = "spn_" + @photo.Id.ToString();
[04:06:52] <Endy> And @spnid has a variable named "spn_something" ?
[04:07:00] <lijzzz> yaa
[04:07:13] <nFFF> Im confused
[04:07:16] <lijzzz> it is the concat of spn_and dynamic id
[04:07:30] <lijzzz> which is the photo id
[04:07:55] <Endy> Why don't you just debug this by adding window.alerts to your code and see where it fires and where not .)
[04:08:01] <nFFF> Do any of your selectors work?
[04:08:17] <lijzzz> yaa evrything working
[04:08:28] <lijzzz> i have problem with only the button click event
[04:08:40] <lijzzz> coz the blur is firing first
[04:08:50] <lijzzz> preventing the click event
[04:09:39] <lijzzz> blur is the problem endy
[04:10:00] <lijzzz> see this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4084780/how-should-i-fire-javascript-blur-event-after-click-event-that-causes-the-blur
[04:10:12] <Endy> In any case, doing it like this will cause the ajax call to be made twice
[04:10:23] <Endy> Is that what you or the client wants :)
[04:11:12] <lijzzz> i want the ajax call to made once only when the user clicks on the save button
[04:11:33] <lijzzz> but now the ajax call happens even on blur event
[04:11:39] <Endy> yey you're calling the click function from the blur event
[04:11:48] <lijzzz> i wil remove that
[04:12:06] <Endy> so what's the problem then ?
[04:12:26] <Endy> Put in blur what you want, then do the ajax call from the click ?
[04:12:28] <lijzzz> but when i remove that the blur is executing dude
[04:12:44] <lijzzz> ok this is the case now
[04:12:49] <lijzzz> i clicked on span
[04:12:58] <lijzzz> the textbox and button appeared
[04:13:13] <lijzzz> a try to click the button, the blur happens and not the click
[04:13:33] <lijzzz> now u got it?
[04:14:20] <lijzzz> endy ):
[04:14:34] <Endy> And then the button disappears ?
[04:14:41] <lijzzz> yes
[04:14:47] <Endy> So basically the button disappears before you get a chance to click it
[04:14:54] <Endy> EVen though you click it :)
[04:14:54] <lijzzz> yes
[04:14:59] <lijzzz> right
[04:15:08] <lijzzz> and button click event is not firing
[04:15:18] <Endy> Like I said, delay() to the beginning of the blur event
[04:15:24] <Endy> 1sec or so should do it
[04:15:34] <lijzzz> ok lemme try that
[04:15:39] <Endy> Then it won't hide() the button
[04:15:42] <Endy> and you should get your click event
[04:15:55] <lijzzz> gr8
[04:15:58] <lijzzz> danx
[04:16:22] <nFFF> why not just hide it in the click handler?
[04:16:37] <lijzzz> hide wat?
[04:16:38] <Endy> Because the client demands blur !

[04:20:42] <nFFF> I was thinking more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/9/
[04:21:20] <nFFF> sorry that should be imgsave.trigger('click')
[04:21:45] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/10/
[04:22:45] <lijzzz> but that wil make the save button click to trigger on blur event right?
[04:23:04] <nFFF> yea
[04:23:22] <lijzzz> it should not
[04:23:33] <Endy> http://jsfiddle.net/ndrPM/4/ someone plz explain/help why the second icon breaks

[04:30:45] <jpic> hi all, how to bind a callback to: if the user clicked anywhere else than someelement to exit the page ?
[04:31:10] <jpic> say if the user clicks any link except one, i want to delete a cookie
[04:31:32] <jpic> or if he submits the form from somewhere else than my link
[04:32:21] <jpic> what i'm trying to do precisely is: if the user clicks "save and continue editing" (rather than "save and add another" or clicking away from the form), the same form tab should open on page reload
[04:33:12] <lijzzz> nfff
[04:35:12] <fotoflo> hmm i want to fire an event if the mouse is idle for 300 ms -- how would I do something like that?
[04:35:39] <Endy> jpic :Give an explicit name (id) for the link and check in the click event handler ?
[04:35:56] <lijzzz> endy that didnt work
[04:36:01] <lijzzz> giving a delay
[04:36:14] <lijzzz> stil the save button event is not firing
[04:37:00] <Onkeltem> Hi all. I'm looking for a jQuery plugin/snippet which would arrange floating boxes like cells in a table - each row must have height of a tallest box in the row. Any ideas?
[04:37:19] <Endy> lijzzz then try setTimeout
[04:37:25] <lijzzz> :)
[04:37:35] <lijzzz> back to the old one?
[04:37:41] <Endy> yes :)
[04:37:48] <Onkeltem> http://masonry.desandro.com/ - I found this plugin, but I don't need such a sofisticated placement, I need a table
[04:40:36] <jpic> Endy: see i have _continue button which sets a cookie, _save and _addanother which clears it, but i'm looking for a way to clear the cookie if the user navigates away without submiting the form ... is there an event for location change or something like that ?
[04:42:53] <nFFF> lijzzz there
[04:42:56] <nFFF> ok where do I go
[04:43:24] <lijzzz> u logged in?
[04:43:28] <lijzzz> nff
[04:43:55] <lijzzz> nff on the right side u can see liju with a down arow
[04:44:11] <nFFF> yes]
[04:44:12] <lijzzz> click on that and u wil see an album option
[04:44:15] <nFFF> yes
[04:44:54] <lijzzz> click on any album and go inside
[04:45:15] <nFFF> ok
[04:45:21] <lijzzz> there u can see the title under each photo
[04:45:31] <lijzzz> clicking on that opens a textbox and save
[04:45:37] <nFFF> yes
[04:46:13] <lijzzz> for me when i try to click the button, the blur is occuring first before the button click
[04:46:49] <nFFF> what file is the js in on the server?
[04:46:49] <lijzzz> in their code i can see something like onBlur: function() {             this.blurTimeOut = setTimeout(util.bind(this.cancel, this), 250);
[04:46:59] <lijzzz> edit.js
[04:47:03] <nFFF> is this your site?
[04:47:07] <lijzzz> no
[04:47:17] <lijzzz> i want to make a site similar to this
[04:47:55] <nFFF> what file is the js in on the server?
[04:48:11] <nFFF> I still have no idea what your talking about
[04:48:18] <lijzzz> wat
[04:48:29] <lijzzz> this is some other website
[04:48:31] <nFFF> This site works fine
[04:48:51] <lijzzz> i want to make a site similar to this i told na
[04:49:03] <lijzzz> i have not hosted that yet
[04:52:19] <nFFF> Ok, and your issue is what
[04:52:34] <lijzzz> my god
[04:52:53] <lijzzz> u saw the save button right?
[04:52:56] <nFFF> yes
[04:53:10] <lijzzz> a text box
[04:53:17] <nFFF> yes
[04:53:35] <lijzzz> so normally when u try to move ur cursor from the textbox and try to click on the button
[04:53:46] <lijzzz> wat event would fire first
[04:53:54] <lijzzz> the blur only right?
[04:54:17] <nFFF> but why not bind the blur to the parent element so you dont have this issue?
[04:54:19] <lijzzz> i dont want the blur to fire first as it is blocking my button click event to fire
[04:54:43] <nFFF> why not bind blur the the same element
[04:54:51] <nFFF> .albumview-text"
[04:55:12] <Trisox> any one knows a better plugin that does the same? http://connect.gxsoftware.com/dashboardplugin/demo/dashboard.html
[04:56:10] <lijzzz> nff it is a span
[04:56:20] <lijzzz> oh my god i am reinventing the wheel
[04:57:12] <nFFF> so?
[04:57:23] <nFFF> I dont understand why you cant bind it the span event
[04:57:37] <nFFF> should work in modern browsers
[04:57:55] <lijzzz> bind wat to the span event
[04:58:00] <nFFF> the blur....
[04:58:06] <nFFF> like I just said
[04:58:34] <nFFF> Or create a custom click event
[04:58:39] <nFFF> and check the target
[04:59:04] <lijzzz> nff when i click on span it is hiding the span and showing the textbox and button
[04:59:43] <lijzzz> and i want blur to be done on textbox and click to be done on button
[05:00:13] <lijzzz> Trisox, u here ?
[05:01:25] <nFFF> lijzzz, in the blur callback, you are hiding the click button before it's click event is called, right?
[05:02:10] <lijzzz> yaaa
[05:03:08] <lijzzz> i if u chek zoomin.com if you click anywhere else other than the save button, it wil hide the button and textbox
[05:03:27] <lijzzz> nfff
[05:04:46] <thomaslfromz> hello
[05:08:14] <nFFF> lijzzz
[05:08:22] <nFFF> could try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/24DtX/11/
[05:09:10] <nFFF> quick google search shows that mousedown will fire before blur, so you could use that on the save button to prevent the blur
[05:12:57] <Trisox> wut
[05:16:47] <Trisox> nFFF: you could make function blur pase some var's around
[05:17:13] <Trisox> oh you did :D
[05:18:06] <beeviz> uhm, is it the correct behavior when $(document).ready() is fired immediately when the document is already ready, in case the event is bound later? (example follows)
[05:19:04] <beeviz> $(document).ready(function() { $('button').on('click', function() { $(document).ready(function() { alert('document ready and button clicked'); }); }); });
[05:19:17] <beeviz> (i know it makes no sense in this specific case)
[05:21:54] <Cork> beeviz: yes jquery trigger ready once, and runs all functions passed to it directly afterwards
[05:22:31] <pachet> beeviz: from the documentation : If .ready() is called after the DOM has been initialized, the new handler passed in will be executed immediately.
[05:22:36] <beeviz> ah ok, thank you cork
[05:22:44] <beeviz> ok, thank you :)
[05:23:35] <Zogot> Its quite large, and at the moment I can't put a working example online, but if anyone gets a chance, I would love someone to look over http://pastebin.com/3Urzbrb0 .  Its for an image wall
[05:25:58] <Julien> hello
[05:26:29] <Julien> it seems that $(document.createElement('img')) il faster than $('img />')

[05:27:10] <antgel> hi all, i'm reading about the load method in jquery.  i can see it can be used to load an html fragment into a div, but what do i do if i want to load a whole new page (new url) *then* execute some javascript?  can i use jquery load in this way?
[05:27:15] <Julien> have you test this before ?
[05:27:45] <pachet> no, i don't need to
[05:28:01] * stenno|work watches from a distance, but somehow closer
[05:29:17] <Julien> i can read the same here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327047/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-create-html-elements-using-jquery
[05:36:38] <antgel> hi all, i'm reading about the load method in jquery.  i can see it can be used to load an html fragment into a div, but what do i do if i want to load a whole new page (new url) *then* execute some javascript?  can i use jquery load in this way?
[05:37:04] <Cork> no
[05:37:24] <Cork> that would be xss and browsers activly prevents that
[05:39:09] <antgel> Cork: hi, thanks for asking.  so what's the idiom to do this?  background is that i have a lightweight client-side-only webapp.  i tried window.location.href = 'new_page.shtml'; followed by my desired code, but the code ran too soon, it was a mess.  what am i missing?
[05:39:17] <antgel> s/asking/answering/ :)
[05:39:43] <vl1234> gud ev
[05:39:50] <Cork> antgel: you could have a proxy server side that proxy it for you
[05:40:08] <Cork> antgel: or if its the same domain you could use an iframe
[05:40:17] <Cork> other then that its not posible
[05:40:17] <vl1234> i have a small doubt about display a button things
[05:40:52] <antgel> Cork: i'm looking to avoid servers, it has to be lightweight, i'm running mongoose.  it is the same domain.  i hear bad things about iframes.  perhaps the only thing i can do is have new_page.shtml include a separate javascript file and put the code in there.
[05:41:18] <pachet> antgel: you can just load 'new_page.shtml' and change the href with history.pushState()
[05:41:26] <Cork> ya
[05:41:28] <pachet> take a look at the source for github paging
[05:41:32] <pachet> that's what they do :[
[05:41:41] <Cork> or you could put the reference you need as parameters to the new url
[05:41:53] <vl1234> my button name s  "click me here" but the button length should be 80px ly and how to hide extra text s avl means
[05:42:01] <Cork> ?g history.js @ antgel
[05:42:02] <bot-t> antgel, balupton/history.js · GitHub - https://github.com/balupton/History.js/
[05:43:08] <pachet> vl1234: your question isn't immediately intelligible, but i think that's more of a css question
[05:43:47] <Cork> vl1234: and by button do you mean a <button> a submit button , jquery button, or what?
[05:44:36] <beeviz> anyone here who can explain to me why console.log(script).length says 0 here? http://pastebin.com/THGBQV8U
[05:45:35] <pachet> beeviz: jquery strips out script tags to prevent them from being executed multiple times
[05:45:44] <pachet> so it won't be reflected in your dynamic markup
[05:46:03] <solsTiCe> hi. how can I select an attribute with a : in its name ? is it even possible ? like $('path[sodipodi:type="arc"]');
[05:47:10] <pachet> solsTiCe: you have to escape the colon with two backslashes
[05:47:18] <pachet> sodipodi\\:type=
[05:47:35] <solsTiCe> :-o 2 ? why 2 ? i tried one
[05:47:51] <solsTiCe> pachet: htanks anyway. works fine now
[05:48:15] <solsTiCe> to esacpe the first \ ?
[05:48:19] <pachet> solsTiCe: yes
[05:48:20] <Cork> solsTiCe: "\\s" when enterpred becomes "\"
[05:48:25] <Cork> sorry "s"
[05:48:28] <Cork> bah...
[05:48:31] <Cork> "\s"
[05:48:35] <vl1234> @pachet and @cork ya its css ly.............i trying overflow:hidden and also am giving standard width size...........and thankzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[05:48:54] <Cork> solsTiCe: the \: is for the selector so it needs to be in the string
[05:48:59] <stenno|work> somebody seems to be happy :)
[05:49:09] <pachet> or sleepy
[05:49:53] <antgel> pachet: i'll investigate history.pushState(), no clue what you mean now but i'll grok code :)
[05:50:10] <Gnagno> hello all
[05:50:24] <Cork> antgel: you should load the content of the new page and replace it on the current page

[05:50:36] <bot-t> antgel, Manipulating the browser history - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[05:50:37] <Cork> antgel: in other words never reload it
[05:50:41] <Gnagno> will $(this) always return the object that raised the event I am dealing with ?
[05:51:06] <Cork> Gnagno: this is the element the event happend on
[05:51:12] <solsTiCe> ok
[05:51:19] <Cork> $() wrapps that in a jquery object
[05:51:55] <Gnagno> Cork, is there a difference between the element "the event happened on" and the element that "raised the event" ?
[05:52:01] <Gnagno> can they be different?
[05:52:07] <Cork> Gnagno: yes
[05:52:14] <Cork> Gnagno: events can bubble
[05:52:36] <Gnagno> Cork, I have to use stoppropagating right?
[05:52:54] <Cork> <div><a/></div> $('div').click(function() { this will be the div even if you click the a tag });
[05:53:03] <pachet> ^
[05:53:07] <Cork> Gnagno: if you want the propagation to stop yes
[05:53:16] <pachet> whereas function(event){event.target---> will yield the a tag
[05:53:39] <Gnagno> pachet, so I can use $(this).target ?
[05:53:45] <Cork> no
[05:53:46] <pachet> no
[05:53:50] <Cork> $(event.target)
[05:53:57] <Gnagno> oh yes... thanks
[05:54:41] <Onkeltem> Does anybody use Isotope plugin? I can't get how it works with _variable_ height blocks?
[05:54:53] <Onkeltem> Looks like it ignores heights
[05:55:37] <Hawkee> how can I cache data for a particular URL so when I return the data is still available?
[05:55:57] <Hawkee> using Javascript
[05:56:39] <Onkeltem> Damn it, I spent 2 hours  trying to find a plugin which will make a TABLE from my floating DIVs!
[05:56:57] <Onkeltem> and yet to find one
[05:57:15] <Hawkee> Onkeltem, sometimes you just have to write it yourself
[05:57:17] <Cork> Onkeltem: um.. you could prob have written one your self in 2h >_>
[05:57:36] <Onkeltem> But isn't it a _common_ task?
[05:57:50] <stenno|work> why would you do that :(
[05:57:55] <Cork> not really, never heard anyone needing it until now
[05:58:00] <stenno|work> ^
[05:58:01] <Jon47> Hawkee you can always do it server-side, or use localStorage if the support matrix is good enough for you: http://caniuse.com/#search=localStorage
[05:58:46] <Onkeltem> Really?
[05:58:48] <Jon47> Onkeltem: can you not just render it initially as a table?
[05:59:05] <Hawkee> Jon47, yes localStorage looks like the key
[05:59:06] <pachet> Hawkee: you can also use history.replaceState() to update the associated obj for the current url
[05:59:14] <Hawkee> this is for an endless scroll plugin I'm building
[05:59:17] <pachet> ?g mdn replacestate @ Hawkee
[05:59:19] <bot-t> Hawkee, Manipulating the browser history - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[05:59:24] <Hawkee> I want to cache the data so you can return to your place
[05:59:36] <beeviz> pachet and is there a another way to access them?
[05:59:37] <Onkeltem> I have a grid of fix-width items. Say we have 4 columns. Ok. Now when I shrink a browser window, I want to get 3 columns, 2 columns etc
[05:59:58] <Onkeltem> Jon47, stenno|work, Cork  : ^^
[06:00:32] <beeviz> i tried to replace <script> with <foo> and doing find('foo) instead. that worked but i'm not sure if there's a better way maybe
[06:00:33] <Jon47> Onkeltem: look into usng media queries
[06:00:37] <Hawkee> which would be better for an endless scroll cache? replacestate or localstorage?
[06:00:37] <beeviz> more "elegant"
[06:00:58] <Hawkee> which is more modern
[06:00:58] <Onkeltem> Jon47: would you be more specific?
[06:01:46] <Jon47> Onkeltem:  css media queries allow you to write style rules that vary with the browser viewport size
[06:01:59] <Teduardo> is it tremendously difficult to have it so that if you change a form element there is a box on the right side of the screen that updates? like in a shopping cart?
[06:02:15] <Hawkee> looks like replacestate isn't even available in IE9, so I may need to use localstorage
[06:02:24] <stenno|work> yay css @media rocks
[06:02:37] <stenno|work> is localstorage available in IE9?
[06:02:42] <Jon47> Teduardo no, bind a handler to the input's "change" event
[06:02:42] <pachet> yes
[06:02:49] <Jon47> stenno|work: yes, it's available in IE8 even
[06:02:52] <stenno|work> wow
[06:02:55] <pachet> stenno|work: ie8+, but its a little wonky
[06:02:57] <stenno|work> so compliant!
[06:03:07] <pachet> i dunno if compliant would be the word :[
[06:03:13] <pachet> complacent
[06:03:13] <stenno|work> yes
[06:03:34] <Hawkee> localstorage looks pretty nice
[06:03:39] <Teduardo> Jon47: do you know of any examples?
[06:03:41] <stenno|work> i heard IE9 does a good job concerning both html5 support and js performance
[06:03:49] <Cork> Hawkee: its quite horrible actually
[06:04:00] <Hawkee> Cork, what are some of the pitfalls?
[06:04:01] <Jon47> IE9 is aight, 10 is even better
[06:04:11] <Cork> Hawkee: you page will halt on load until everythin you put into localstorage is loaded into memory
[06:04:12] <stenno|work> Hawkee, never trust the client :o
[06:04:20] <pachet> ie9 still has the major gotcha of sucking king d--k in 64bit
[06:04:27] <stenno|work> hehe
[06:04:36] <Hawkee> stenno|work, this is more of a luxury than a critical feature though
[06:04:45] <Cork> Hawkee: so make to not put too much data in there
[06:04:55] <Hawkee> I wonder what facebook and Google+ use to store your place in the endless scroll when you click away
[06:04:56] <Cork> *make sure not to
[06:04:58] <stenno|work> Hawkee, true
[06:05:53] <Teduardo> I was having the weirdest issue with IE9 yesterday after you fill out a form and hit back it put the form back to it's original state but firefox kept the form selections
[06:06:13] <Teduardo> so i had to actually go through and hard set the fields to what the user selected
[06:06:14] <Teduardo> hassle
[06:06:16] <stenno|work> sounds like caching
[06:06:24] <Hawkee> Cork, how much is too much data? I'm looking as much as a hundred or two kb but only when somebody scrolls really far
[06:06:37] <stenno|work> i remember Chrome uses some very agressive js caching
[06:07:23] <Cork> Hawkee: you will have diskio for 200kb before your pages render, on each reload
[06:07:42] <Cork> so you will add that pennalty to your load time
[06:07:59] <Cork> i would prob set the limit on a few kb
[06:08:05] <Cork> say 5-10
[06:08:36] <Hawkee> Cork, what do you think facebook does to cache the feed when you scroll all the way to the bottom?
[06:08:49] <Hawkee> I imagine they need to do the same thing
[06:08:57] <Cork> not sure, suspect they do that in pure js
[06:09:02] <Cork> or in the dom
[06:09:40] <Hawkee> they append their results as you scroll, so that appended data needs to be stored in a cache of some sort
[06:09:47] <Cork> or they could just save your last position in a cookie, and make a bigger request the next time
[06:09:58] <Hawkee> hmm
[06:10:06] <Hawkee> that's an idea
[06:10:09] <Cork> theres quite a long list of solutions
[06:10:52] <Hawkee> storing the page number using localstorage would be no problem at all
[06:11:00] <Hawkee> just a byte or two
[06:11:22] <Cork> wouldn't be too bad no
[06:11:37] <Hawkee> but then I'd have to loop through all the pages and append each one
[06:11:54] <Cork> you could do that server side
[06:12:01] <Hawkee> yes, that's what I'm thinking right now
[06:12:16] <Hawkee> just store the page number with each request on the session
[06:12:40] <Hawkee> but I need to store it in relation to the particular page
[06:12:50] <Hawkee> because there are multiple pages that do this
[06:13:17] <Hawkee> and I'd also have to scrollTop to their previous place
[06:13:54] <Hawkee> but maybe the browser would automatically scrollTop if the place is there once again
[06:14:30] <Cork> depends
[06:14:50] <Hawkee> I want to release this code when I'm done and I was thinking it would be helpful to provide a mechanism
[06:14:54] <Cork> but yes, in some circumstances it does
[06:14:57] <Hawkee> doing it server side doesn't really improve my offering
[06:15:16] <Hawkee> but it does help my particular use
[06:15:19] <pachet> there's always hash refs :[
[06:15:24] <pachet> saves having to .scrollTop
[06:15:50] <Hawkee> pachet, yes but this will be the user pressing back after viewing a dynamic page
[06:15:53] <Hawkee> no hash ref
[06:17:31] <Hawkee> I may try localstorage just to see how it performs and to provide it as an option but for my case I might just use a cookie
[06:18:31] <nights> how can i force a "change" when my page load?
[06:18:41] <stenno|work> can't you just .emit ?
[06:18:52] <stenno|work> or .trigger
[06:18:55] <stenno|work> that was it
[06:19:03] <nights> stenno|work: was that for me?
[06:19:07] <nights> :S
[06:19:09] <stenno|work> yes
[06:19:12] <nights> ok
[06:19:16] <nights> well maybe
[06:19:17] <nights> i have
[06:19:19] <nights> $("#order_time").change(function(e){
[06:19:26] <nights> basically want this to remain intact
[06:19:34] <stenno|work> you can trigger the 'change' event by $("#order_time").trigger("change"); or something
[06:19:36] <nights> but also want to use the same code when load page
[06:19:38] <stenno|work> am not sure about this one
[06:19:47] <nights> hm
[06:19:49] <nights> let me try that
[06:20:03] <pachet> nights: stenno|work is right
[06:20:08] <stenno|work> yay]
[06:20:09] <Cork> $("#order_time").trigger("change"); or just $("#order_time").change(); should work
[06:20:32] <nights> excellent
[06:20:34] <nights> works perfectly
[06:20:37] <stenno|work> cool
[06:20:38] <nights> thanks so much guys
[06:20:41] <nights> hats off.
[06:20:42] <stenno|work> :)
[06:21:34] <drautert> in animations, does jquery calculate all the steps prior to the animation or is each step calculated after the previous step?
[06:21:41] <pachet> that being said, why not just bind $('#order_time').on('change.mynamespace', myFunction); then call myFunction on page load :[
[06:21:48] <pachet> saves having to go through jq's event architecture
[06:23:20] <stenno|work> drautert, each after the next step
[06:23:26] <stenno|work> i think
[06:23:27] <stenno|work> :D
[06:23:36] * stenno|work has dangerous half-knowledge
[06:23:56] <stenno|work> you can bind a handler to the step: event of animation
[06:24:19] <stenno|work> which gets executed after each step
[06:24:24] <drautert> yea the easing functions calculate at each step so i thought the whole animation probably would, is there a reason for that?
[06:24:45] <stenno|work> well you have full control over each step
[06:24:49] <stenno|work> that could be a reason
[06:24:59] <drautert> true
[06:25:26] <stenno|work> you can react to other stuff _during_ the animation, which is a plus point too
[06:25:51] <stenno|work> also you can write any easing function or whatever yourself
[06:25:54] <drautert> my animations are smooth in chrome and choppy in firefox, im trying to find a way to smooth things up in ff
[06:26:04] <stenno|work> hmm i know this problem
[06:26:42] <stenno|work> i'd say, just play around with the parameters until both are rather smooth
[06:27:03] <drautert> by parameters you mean, something like fx.interval?
[06:27:16] <stenno|work> erm
[06:27:29] * stenno|work looks up jQuery.animate again :)
[06:27:51] <pachet> drautert: yes
[06:28:21] <stenno|work> duration: A string or number determining how long the animation will run.
[06:28:22] <stenno|work> easing: A string indicating which easing function to use for the transition.
[06:28:22] <stenno|work> complete: A function to call once the animation is complete.
[06:28:22] <stenno|work> step: A function to be called after each step of the animation.
[06:28:28] <stenno|work> those parameter :)
[06:28:40] <stenno|work> as i said, you can write the easing function yourself, too
[06:28:53] <stenno|work> so if you want logarithmic (sp?) easing...
[06:29:50] <drautert> i set interval to 24, seems really nice in chrome, but in firefox i get sometimes this jerkiness, it'll go through say 80% of the steps and then lock up and skip to 100%
[06:29:52] <pachet> stenno|work: none of those parameters have an effect on the internal animation tick speed
[06:30:23] <pachet> drautert: you're right, setting jQuery.fx.interval = whatever is how you'd effect that
[06:30:49] <drautert> yup, but any idea what might be causing firefox's jerkiness during the animations?
[06:31:07] <stenno|work> firefox uses a different JS interpreter..?
[06:31:33] <stenno|work> chrome uses v8, whereas ff uses some *Monkey (please correct me if i am wrong)
[06:31:41] <stenno|work> jagermonkey or something
[06:32:06] <drautert> yea something like that, but it shouldn't be jerky when animating an element
[06:32:17] <stenno|work> it shouldn't but it is
[06:33:09] <drautert> that's ... not workable
[06:38:46] <thomaslfromz> down? http://api.jquery.com
[06:41:44] <pachet> ?down http://api.jquery.com
[06:41:51] <bot-t> pachet, It's not just you! - http://api.jquery.com looks down from here.
[06:41:58] <pachet> thomaslfromz ^
[06:42:38] <thomaslfromz> oh, not down just very slow
[06:43:10] <F3rr31r4> hello
[06:43:22] <F3rr31r4> can some one tell me how to renderJSON("hello"); and retrieve in the view :( i just get a file :(
[06:43:56] <stenno|work> what view
[06:44:19] <F3rr31r4> html
[06:45:16] <F3rr31r4> it should be something like $.getJSON(
[06:46:02] <_elek> not sure what you mean, the docs are pretty clear and have an example of how to use the success callback
[06:46:05] <_elek> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:46:06] <stenno|work> doesn't $.getJSON issue an ajax request?
[06:46:13] <_elek> yes
[06:46:17] <stenno|work> so
[06:46:39] <stenno|work> bind a function to the success event and write your result to the page ^^"
[06:47:14] <stenno|work> oh, what _elek said
[06:47:16] <stenno|work> i should read
[06:48:01] <stenno|work> there is also JSON.parse("string") and JSON.stringify(object); (thats vanilla javascript though), fyi
[06:48:18] <jae> hi guys
[06:49:10] <F3rr31r4> _elek i think the problem is in the server side :(n
[06:49:31] <F3rr31r4> i do like this renderJSON("hello");
[06:49:32] <_elek> use firebug or chrome console and see what the response from the server is
[06:49:43] <F3rr31r4> and i retrieve a file
[06:50:32] <stenno|work> i dunno the renderJSON command
[06:50:49] <_elek> i think you mean parseJson
[06:51:02] <stenno|work> isn't it even JSON.parse ?
[06:51:12] <jae> has anyone ever hand a problem with change() and browser autofill feature?
[06:52:40] <xec_> parseJSON() seems to be a server side (Java) function in a framework  called "Play"
[06:52:40] <fotoflo> what do you guys like more, firebug lite for chrome or chrome's built in inspector and console?
[06:52:57] <jae> i like inspector more
[06:53:14] <xec_> sorry, renderJSON()
[06:53:42] <pachet> :[
[06:53:45] <pachet> all work and no Play
[06:53:45] <F3rr31r4> xec_ play framework
[06:55:19] <xec_> F3rr31r4: we can't help you with server side code, unfortunately, but if you think your js code with the ajax call is causing an issue, pastebin the code so we can take a look
[06:56:00] <fotoflo> jae: why?
[06:56:15] <F3rr31r4> xec_> i trying to use https://github.com/thegrubbsian/jquery.ganttView
[06:56:49] <F3rr31r4> <xec_> but 1st i'm learning how to pass values with json ;)
[06:57:13] <F3rr31r4> <xec_> when i have something good i will take tour advise
[06:57:23] <F3rr31r4> <xec_> thanks anyway
[06:57:45] <jae> it feels easier for me
[06:57:57] <jae> and it does alot of things that im ok with
[06:58:25] <xec_> F3rr31r4: you can find some nice examples at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:59:01] <F3rr31r4> <xec_> ;)
[06:59:11] <jae> so anyone have any problems with autofill feature not triggering .change()?
[07:03:41] <lenswipe> hey guys
[07:03:42] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[07:03:46] <stenno|work> no
[07:03:51] <stenno|work> we are all idling
[07:03:59] <stenno|work> so shhhh!
[07:04:04] <lenswipe> lol
[07:04:16] <lenswipe> i have some jquery that posts data to a CodeIgniter controller
[07:04:21] <Woet> ?ask @ lenswipe
[07:04:26] <lenswipe> when i use the controller action normally (with a normal form) it works fine
[07:04:27] <Woet> damn you bot-t
[07:04:37] <Woet> ? ask @ lenswipe
[07:04:37] <lenswipe> when i use jquery to post to it i get a 500 reported by jquery
[07:04:38] <bot-t> lenswipe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:04:38] <bot-t> lenswipe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:04:40] <Woet> ah
[07:04:40] <Woet> yay
[07:04:41] <lenswipe> Woet, i am asking
[07:04:50] <Woet> I know, bot-t took a while to catch up
[07:04:51] <Woet> :<
[07:05:11] <Woet> lenswipe: 500 error is a server error.
[07:05:26] <lenswipe> i know what it is
[07:05:32] <stenno|work> 5xx is server side, yes
[07:05:35] <Woet> lenswipe: okay, then I'm not sure why you are asking #jquery
[07:06:13] <lenswipe> Woet, im asking in #jquery because the controller action works perfectly if i post to it with a normal form
[07:06:21] <lenswipe> it only reports a 500 if i post to it using jquery
[07:06:36] <Woet> lenswipe: and what did we establish about 500 errors?
[07:07:10] <stenno|work> lenswipe, you should inspect the server log for errors
[07:07:20] <stenno|work> lenswipe, there you will get a hint on what is wrong
[07:07:23] <lenswipe> stenno|work, i did
[07:07:25] <lenswipe> it said 500
[07:07:28] <stenno|work> what
[07:07:29] <jae> does anyone know the correct event trigger to use when trying to detect the autofill feature of a browser?
[07:07:32] <Woet> lenswipe: the server log says 500? lol.
[07:07:42] <lenswipe> Woet, well it says what page its on but i already know that
[07:07:42] <stenno|work> what kind of server log is this
[07:07:50] <Woet> lenswipe: look in the proper log.
[07:07:51] <lenswipe> stenno|work, /etc/apache2/error.log
[07:07:56] <lenswipe> wait no
[07:07:59] <Woet> lenswipe: since when are logs in /etc?
[07:08:01] <lenswipe> /var/log/apache2/error.log
[07:08:05] <lenswipe> Woet, yeah my bad
[07:08:12] <stenno|work> hehe
[07:08:13] <Woet> lenswipe: you are running PHP I am assuming?
[07:08:16] <lenswipe> Woet, yep
[07:08:22] <Woet> lenswipe: and you enabled PHP errors?
[07:08:25] <lenswipe> yes
[07:08:37] <Woet> lenswipe: well, a 500 server error is server side and completely unrelated to jquery
[07:08:45] <Woet> so contact ##php / #httpd (or whatever webserver you use)
[07:09:13] <antgel> pachet, Cork: i read your link and i'm confused.  why should i care about the browser history?  perhaps i can't see the forest for the trees.  to recap, what i'd like to do is: 1) load a new page 2) execute some javascript after the page has loaded.  i did try using .load to load my content into a div (it's a big middle column), but then my jquery tabs don't load when i call .tabs().  any clarifications?
[07:10:43] <lenswipe> Woet, im using the codeigniter framework so im in there right now
[07:10:51] <jae> :(
[07:10:58] <jae> i guess nobody knows
[07:11:29] <stenno|work> change doesn't get triggered?
[07:11:32] <jae> yeah
[07:11:38] <RingZer0> I need to check if any select boxes in a container still have "select" -- does this look right: $('ul#authors li select option:selected').each(function(){ if ($(this).val() == 'select') { alert('problem'); } });
[07:11:47] <jae> i tried .live() .bind() .change()
[07:11:57] <stenno|work> is that bound at $(document).ready ?
[07:12:03] <jae> nothing works when it's autofill
[07:12:05] <Whirl3d> jae, did you trie .on
[07:12:14] <Whirl3d> *try
[07:12:15] <jae> onchange?
[07:12:28] <Whirl3d> ?.on @ jae
[07:12:29] <bot-t> jae, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:12:33] <Stire> I've just started with JQuery and trying to animate my NavBar, but it's not doing anything, Could anybody have a quick look at it please? http://pastebin.com/GNadvDaM
[07:12:37] <jae> yes steeno, its bound at $ready
[07:13:02] <jae> let me try whirl3d
[07:13:22] <stenno|work> that implies that the browser autofills _before_ $(document).ready
[07:13:31] <stenno|work> and thus there is not much you can do about
[07:13:42] <jae> nono, its after i load it
[07:13:43] <stenno|work> nothing a noob like me can think of, though
[07:13:45] <Whirl3d> Stire, you have to place your scripts inside of a $(document).ready (function () {  scripts here })
[07:13:45] <jae> im using chrome
[07:13:57] <Stire> I'll try that! Thanks!
[07:14:02] <jae> choose a username -> autofills
[07:14:06] <stenno|work> oh
[07:14:10] <stenno|work> strange
[07:14:23] <jae> triggers the first input, doens't trigger for the rest
[07:14:45] <stenno|work> ok after you chose a username the complete form autofills?
[07:14:50] <jae> yup
[07:14:51] <Whirl3d> jae, do you have a link?
[07:14:55] <stenno|work> and the change for the others is not triggered?
[07:14:56] <jae> it's chromes built in
[07:15:06] <jae> http://staff.sei.co.th
[07:15:54] <jae> yaeh
[07:16:06] <jae> excuse my jquery, it isn't exactly neat
[07:16:07] <Whirl3d> jae in html5, there is an autocomplete attribute to your html that you can turn off
[07:16:20] <jae> ah yes, but i want it to support ie
[07:16:28] <stenno|work> but still the change event should be triggered right
[07:16:33] <jae> exactly
[07:16:42] <stenno|work> ie9+ has nice html5 support btw
[07:16:45] <Whirl3d> then use an html5 shiv or something
[07:17:20] <jae> hmm appreciate ur concern whirl3d, but i just feel that i lack a line or two
[07:17:44] <jae> just wondering, if im missing something?
[07:17:50] <jae> saw this as a bug in jquery 1.4
[07:17:55] <SnackWhack> can I get some help starting some jQuery? The fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/1/ - I want to find the table with a class of "bordertable" (I can't modify the code that generates this table, so I have to find by class.) Then, if the first row of that table is "Pending", then I want to loop through every row after "ID" and collect the IDs into an array or similar.
[07:17:58] <Whirl3d> try naming your field something different
[07:18:05] <Stire> @whirl3d, it still doesn't work for me unfortunaly:( http://pastebin.com/eLbzMQvq
[07:18:10] <jae> alrite
[07:18:34] <solsTiCe> so I want to fade a color from red back to its original color. but I can't use animate and css because it's an svg element using style attribute. how do I make my loop with jquery ? I am not gonna use SetInterval, right ?
[07:18:42] <Whirl3d> it only suggests based on name, so give it an unfamiliar name and maybe it will work.
[07:19:13] <Whirl3d> Stire, you have to use animate correctly.
[07:19:14] <stenno|work> as long as you can access that svg, you can use animate on it
[07:19:46] <RingZer0> I need to check if any select boxes in a container still have "select" -- does this look right: $('ul#authors li select option:selected').each(function(){ if ($(this).val() == 'select') { alert('problem'); } });
[07:19:52] <Whirl3d> $(selector).animate({dest},duration, ease, callback);
[07:21:05] <stenno|work> RingZer0, uhm. option:selected should give you all selects that are selected, right?
[07:21:38] <Whirl3d> Stire, you call animate, but don't tell jquery what to animate. Height? WIdth? Opacity? Position?
[07:21:51] <JavaLover> ok so this guy has a function
[07:22:03] <JavaLover> $.fn.lionbars = function(options)
[07:22:09] <JavaLover> and inside that he has variables...
[07:22:15] <JavaLover> is there anyway to call those variables?
[07:22:25] <JavaLover> or say a function within that function?
[07:22:27] <jae> whirld3d, u suggested me to use .on, what events do i put in it?
[07:22:42] <stenno|work> JavaLover, no, they are handled as somehow closure
[07:23:04] <SnackWhack> Update: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/2/ not working though
[07:23:09] <JavaLover> he does have this "options" variable though
[07:23:12] <stenno|work> you would need to extend the lionbars object with the variables
[07:23:19] <JavaLover> currently i call that as .lionbars();
[07:23:20] <Whirl3d> JavaLover, if the author wrote the plugin correctly, you might be able to access them by passing a "settings" object to the constructor, like $.fn.lionbars({opacity:0});
[07:23:31] <JavaLover> right right
[07:23:38] <JavaLover> that's what i was thinking...do i need the {}
[07:23:40] <stenno|work> only on construction though, yes
[07:23:51] <stenno|work> 'construction'
[07:23:53] <JavaLover> well what's happening is this it's dumb but
[07:24:02] <JavaLover> on the first call to lionbars(); it works fine
[07:24:06] <JavaLover> and then i'm removing code & trying again
[07:24:09] <JavaLover> and it doesn't work
[07:24:20] <JavaLover> and then i found out he has a variable to see if it's been created
[07:24:27] <JavaLover> and if so..then don't add in the lionbars
[07:24:33] <JavaLover> so i just want to reset that variable to false
[07:24:42] <Stire> Whirl3d, thanks, it adds/removes the class BUT it does not animate addclass/removeclass :( http://pastebin.com/gQT8e5SJ
[07:24:43] <Whirl3d> stennojwork, actually, that's not exactly true. Best practices indicate that you can pass private methods in the form of strings to the plugin name for access
[07:24:55] <Whirl3d> Stire, animate what?
[07:24:58] <Whirl3d> Height?
[07:25:01] <Whirl3d> Width?
[07:25:02] <Stire> addclass
[07:25:10] <Stire> border-color
[07:25:20] <shwaiil> hi
[07:25:29] <shwaiil> Q: How to trigger window resize ? Thanks
[07:25:47] <stenno|work> $(window).trigger("resize");
[07:25:48] <stenno|work> :D
[07:25:51] <stenno|work> (my guess)
[07:25:58] <JavaLover> Whirl3d i have the source code...
[07:25:59] <Whirl3d> try something like: $(this).animate({borderColor:red},5000, function () {$(this).addClass("hovered");});
[07:26:08] <JavaLover> if I were to create a settings, howw ould I do that?
[07:26:11] <Stire> Thanks!
[07:26:21] <JavaLover> like he has this.. 	options = options || {};		autohide = options.autohide;
[07:26:29] <JavaLover> but i want it to be like "reset" and then it resets
[07:26:40] <JavaLover> keep in mind i know how to code just not familiar with syntax
[07:27:03] <shwaiil> stenno|work: yeh, worked fine,thanks
[07:27:15] <stenno|work> cool, np
[07:27:43] <SnackWhack> I got it, nm
[07:28:02] <Whirl3d> The preferred way of handling this, I believe is to have a defaultSetting object that can be manipulated by extending it with the constructor option. So you might see var options=$.extend({},defaults, opts);
[07:28:15] <Whirl3d> which combines the defaults with the user-provided opts
[07:28:23] <shwaiil> Q: When using atribute data-foo="bar" on <el>, what's the jquery method to get data ?! .data() right?!
[07:28:41] <pachet> yes that's right!?!
[07:29:01] <pachet> s/yes/A: yes
[07:29:06] <jae> Whirl3d,  i haven't solved it but i appreicate ur help, thanks again
[07:29:18] <jae> stenno|work, thanks as well
[07:29:25] <JavaLover> ok i have a better idea
[07:29:28] <Whirl3d> schwall, I've found that it doesn't always work the way it's supposed to. I almost always check data ("foo") ||el.attr("data-foo") just in case
[07:29:28] <stenno|work> people who are using more than one interpunctuation mark wear their undies on their head
[07:29:29] <stenno|work> np
[07:29:34] <JavaLover> is there a way to set a class or object by id to null?
[07:29:45] <JavaLover> maybe if i set it to null before I clear it, it'll work
[07:30:15] <Whirl3d> JavaLover, what are you trying to do?
[07:30:22] <JavaLover> well i'm just using this lionbars thing
[07:30:22] <stenno|work> element.class(""); should work
[07:30:30] <JavaLover> and on first call it works
[07:30:31] <shwaiil> Whirl3d: thnks for the tip
[07:30:39] <JavaLover> but if i clear my object so innerHTML = "";
[07:30:43] <stenno|work> what jquery is 1.7.2 already :o
[07:30:44] <JavaLover> and then run same exact code to load it
[07:30:46] <JavaLover> it doesn't work
[07:30:47] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[07:31:10] <JavaLover> and upon going over this guys code my only conclusion is he has a variable keeping track of the object
[07:31:22] <stenno|work> JavaLover, also i have to be frank but i detest your nick
[07:31:23] <JavaLover> idk i'm so confused at this point lol
[07:31:42] <OBjectiveCEating> better?
[07:31:48] <Whirl3d> JavaLover, are you familiar with closures?
[07:32:04] <JavaLover> not exactly
[07:33:01] <stenno|work> JavaLover, maybe take a look at JS closures and JS scoping
[07:33:22] <stenno|work> hardly a reason to do anything in js without understanding that concepsts
[07:33:25] <stenno|work> concepts*
[07:33:35] <Whirl3d> Though I am certainly not an expert, a closure is an function that encapsulates variables (which can also be functions) at the time it was created. It allows you to store "private" information in your closure script that can't be accessed externally.
[07:33:51] <stenno|work> Whirl3d, exactly
[07:34:04] <JavaLover> this sounds exactly like the problem
[07:34:11] <stenno|work> so if you have a function() { var temp =23 }; its in  a closure
[07:34:37] <stenno|work> now if you use events and so on, things get a bit complicated
[07:34:45] <JavaLover> see look 	if (el.get(0).scrollWidth > el.get(0).clientWidth) {
[07:34:49] <stenno|work> always check what 'this' is
[07:34:52] <JavaLover> that's the line of code he uses to determine if adding a scroll bar
[07:35:12] <Whirl3d> So a common workaround in jquery is to allow access to these private (methods/variables) by invoking the plugin method with various options that indicate to the plugin "do this..." for example. Which would otherwise be private
[07:35:37] <JavaLover> right so what i need to do is enable the reset, he has a function reset();
[07:35:56] <JavaLover> and he does have an options variable i haven't been using...
[07:36:08] <Whirl3d> el is likely the local variable used to reference the element (lionbar) in a jquery object. That's why el.get(0) delivers the actual html element.
[07:36:38] <JavaLover> right right...so how would I code a function for his options?
[07:36:49] <SnackWhack> instead of "td:first", I want the 8th td, what's that syntax?
[07:37:10] <SnackWhack> $(this).find("td:8").html();
[07:37:29] <JavaLover> wait a minute
[07:37:32] <JavaLover> can i just put the function in there?
[07:37:36] <Whirl3d> What do you mean by reset?
[07:37:43] <JavaLover> well he has this function reset(){}
[07:37:46] <JavaLover> and it resets all vars
[07:37:52] <router> how do u make a js delegate?
[07:37:52] <JavaLover> and i just want to call it...
[07:37:59] <JavaLover> here i'll show you
[07:38:05] <JavaLover> $.fn.lionbars = function(options) {
[07:38:29] <JavaLover> mainLoop(); function mainloop(){//stuff} function reset(){//stuff}
[07:38:43] <Xotix> Can someone link me the how to built plugin instruction site? I can't find it
[07:38:44] <JavaLover> so i just want to be able to call the reset function via the options variable
[07:40:04] <stenno|work> you have to extend the lionbars object with any function you want to call
[07:40:15] <JavaLover> but i have his source
[07:40:15] <stenno|work> cannot call it like that with the options hash, i think
[07:40:18] <JavaLover> can't i just add it in?
[07:40:29] <antgel> pachet, Cork: okay, i worked it out.  my call to tabs() didn't work as it was running before .load() finished.  i always forget the async thing :)  put tabs() call in the callback and it works :)
[07:41:05] <Whirl3d> he calls resetVars when the element has class ("nolionbars"). so addClass("nolionbars") to the element to get it to reset
[07:41:12] <Xotix> ah finally got it
[07:41:41] <JavaLover> 		jQuery("#test").lionbars();
[07:41:53] <JavaLover> that's what i call ...how would i then call no lion bars?
[07:42:34] <JavaLover> 		jQuery("#test").lionbars("nolionbars"); ?
[07:42:46] <Whirl3d> you would have a div that needs scrollbars, then you do this: $("#test").addClass("nolionbars").lionbars().removeClass("nolionbars").lionbars();
[07:43:29] <Whirl3d> wait, scratch that. I just noticed he negates that. Gimme one more second
[07:43:59] <JavaLover> i should really send whirl3d some paypal lol
[07:44:21] <stenno|work> JavaLover, just do that :)
[07:44:25] <stenno|work> might be a good idea
[07:44:35] <JavaLover> he's been so helpful he even looked up this guys code
[07:44:51] <Xotix> Can someone explain me this: (function( $ ) {â€¦})( jQuery ); ? if i wrap the function into () does a following () call the function?
[07:45:04] <SnackWhack> how would I expand this selector: $('form:nth-child(1)').submit(function() { I want only the tables in that collection where the value of the first TD == 'Pending'
[07:47:58] <Whirl3d> JavaLover, it appears that he resets variables between elements. Why do you need to reset the variables?
[07:48:17] <JavaLover> i'm only guessing
[07:48:22] <JavaLover> but what happens is this
[07:48:23] <SnackWhack> Here's the updated fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/3/ <- All I want to do is extract those IDs, must be an easier way
[07:48:36] <JavaLover> i load all my code into an innerHTML so mypic.innerhtml = "the stuff"
[07:48:41] <JavaLover> i call lionbars(); works perfectly fine
[07:48:54] <JavaLover> then I do this mypic.innerhtml = ""; i reload everything in
[07:48:58] <JavaLover> same exact function
[07:49:02] <JavaLover> call lionbars & nothing happens
[07:49:45] <Whirl3d> He needs to add a
[07:49:48] <Whirl3d> destroy method
[07:49:54] <SnackWhack> I must be invisible today
[07:49:55] <JavaLover> well i can add it
[07:49:58] <JavaLover> i have his code...
[07:50:10] <JavaLover> so what would i do to destroy it?
[07:51:27] <Whirl3d> You would need to check the arguments passed to the function for the string "destroy" if you pass destroy to the $.fn.liobars function, then have it skip the initialization and go right to the destroy function
[07:51:38] <Whirl3d> in the destroy function, delete elements
[07:51:57] <Whirl3d> elements is the container that holds the lionbarified items
[07:52:26] <JavaLover> i see
[07:52:28] <Whirl3d> and he doesn't have any way of removing an element from the list once it's in there other than by adding the "nolionbars" class
[07:52:31] <JavaLover> now he does have this
[07:52:50] <JavaLover>   $.fn.hasScrollBar = function() {        return this.get(0).scrollHeight > this.height();    };
[07:52:55] <JavaLover> so maybe i can just do
[07:52:56] <SnackWhack> let's try a different question... Given this: var needsApproved = $(this).find("td:nth-child(8)").html(); <- That returns the HTML showing the checkbox, but I actually want to see if the checkbox in that TD is checked. How would I do that?
[07:53:01] <JavaLover> $.fn.destroy
[07:53:19] <JavaLover> this.elements = null; ?
[07:53:35] <SnackWhack> 'this' is a tr in that example
[07:53:49] <stenno|work> check your 'this', as i said earlier
[07:54:13] <Whirl3d> you don't want to extend jquery with a destroy function
[07:55:12] <ambikuk> hallo
[07:55:20] <Whirl3d> you want to add just before line 41, something like function destroy() {elements=elements.splice($(this).index());}
[07:56:17] <Whirl3d> I think splice is right. You will have to check how to remove a single element from an array and remove the element at $(this).index
[07:56:29] <Whirl3d> otherwise, you will remove all the lionbars,maybe?
[07:56:35] <JavaLover> and how do I call it?
[07:56:36] <JavaLover> i'm okay with removing all
[07:56:42] <JavaLover> i only use 1 at a time
[07:56:55] <JavaLover> but thats interesting how it keeps track
[07:56:58] <JavaLover> is that why he does this?
[07:57:04] <Whirl3d> then, around line 6, before you start assessing options, try this:
[07:57:10] <JavaLover> so you can call his function multiple times without it failing?
[07:57:19] <Whirl3d> if (options=="destroy") {destroy()}
[07:57:28] <JavaLover> aww nice nice ok i try this
[07:59:39] <Whirl3d> traditionally, there would be a list of "exposed" methods in a string that you would check before anything. So you would say, if ($.type(options)=="string" && methodList.indexOf(options)) { switch(options) {case destoy: destroy()....
[07:59:45] <RingZer0> stenno|work: thanks, I should have TIAS ... appreciate the validateion
[07:59:51] <Hawkee> how do I extend the "scroll" function of a standard widget?
[08:00:03] <JavaLover> yes that's what i thought i was supposed to do
[08:00:10] <JavaLover> a switch method..but i wasn't sure
[08:00:33] <JavaLover> jquery is a language that i'm always looking at like "damn that's kinda complex looking"
[08:01:00] <Whirl3d> Its just javascript
[08:01:09] <Hawkee> would it just be _create: function () {}, scroll: function () {}
[08:02:12] <Whirl3d> Hawkee, huh?
[08:02:34] <Hawkee> I'm building a widget that does infinite scroll
[08:03:22] <Hawkee> maybe I should look at some widget templates
[08:03:45] <Whirl3d> That'd be best. Are you using jqueryUI?
[08:04:06] <Hawkee> I'm not sure if its necessary
[08:04:18] <Hawkee> I'm really just acting on the scroll method
[08:04:33] <Whirl3d> it has a built in widget factory, I believe. Makes widgeting easy
[08:08:10] <Hawkee> but I'm a little unclear whether I need UI to make widgets
[08:08:22] <Hawkee> basically I want the _create method
[08:08:28] <Hawkee> and the scroll event
[08:09:31] <Whirl3d> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[08:09:38] <SnackWhack> Why would this work in IE but not Chrome?    ... $('form:nth-child(1)').submit(function() { ... }
[08:15:36] <Hawkee> Thank you Whirl3d
[08:16:31] <Whirl3d> np--ajpiano is the real one to thank.
[08:16:32] <SnackWhack> yep, just verified it. Why wouldn
[08:16:42] <SnackWhack> yep, just verified it. Why wouldn't that selector work in Chrome... makes no sense
[08:16:56] <Hawkee> yes, that is helpful
[08:17:21] <Hawkee> okay, so what event can I use via a widgetfactory widget to capture a general page scroll?
[08:17:36] <NoiseEee> verify it on jsfiddle and paste the link, snackWhack
[08:17:53] <Whirl3d> SnackWhack, I was under the impression that camel case was the preferred nomenclature for jquery selectors. So nthChild rather than nth-child might be worth a try
[08:17:57] <NoiseEee> also, use a more modern/sensible way to monitor the submit event
[08:18:50] <SnackWhack> NoiseEee: I wish I could, but I can't modify the code that creates the table. It's old ancient PL/SQL that we will update in a year or so, but now my hand is forced
[08:19:08] <SnackWhack> NoiseEee: Unless you know a better way. Let me get the fiddle code updated....
[08:19:50] <Logikos> if i wanted to get the value of the tabindex attribute of an element useing jquery how might i do that please?
[08:20:09] <Logikos> $('#someid').tabindex ?
[08:21:17] <tra> Logikos: $(selector).attr('whateverattribute');
[08:23:44] <Logikos> ty
[08:24:22] <thomb> what is the correct selector for a field with name="current_text[17]"?
[08:25:14] <Larholm> $('input[name="current_text[17]"')
[08:25:19] <Larholm> ehrm
[08:25:30] <Larholm> yeah :)
[08:25:36] <thomb> Larholm: thx :) i will try it
[08:26:10] <SnackWhack> NoiseEee:  Whirl3d : http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/9/
[08:26:30] <thomb> Larholm: $('input[name="current_text[17]"]') ?
[08:27:05] <SnackWhack> NoiseEee:  Whirl3d : I've tried a few different approaches, nothing is showing the alert
[08:27:07] <Whirl3d> Hawkee, sorry. in your _create function, you would monitor the scroll event by binding, el,on("scroll", function (e) {handle the scroll event});
[08:27:37] <gnarf> i think "tabindex" might be one of the ones that you should prefer using .prop instead of .attr
[08:28:48] <Whirl3d> SnackWhack, why aren't you just using $("form input[type='submit']").submit(function () {...
[08:29:06] <SnackWhack> Whirl3d: On the actual page, there are 3 forms
[08:29:24] <SnackWhack> a search form, this form, and some other hidden form
[08:29:45] <Whirl3d> use .on then
[08:30:03] <Hawkee> Whirl3d, thank you.  I'm actually just doing $(window).scroll(function () { ? }); in my _create
[08:30:10] <SnackWhack> Whirl3d: The only button I care about is the one that has the value 'Save'
[08:30:20] <Hawkee> anything wrong with that?
[08:30:28] <Whirl3d> Hawkee sounds good to me
[08:30:30] <SnackWhack> Whirl3d: can you give an example?
[08:31:06] <Hawkee> great, it seems to be working
[08:31:46] <Whirl3d> SnackWhack, then why not just write the selector for that element? $("input[value='Save']").on("click", function (e) {e.preventDefault(); do stuff);
[08:32:57] <SnackWhack> Whirl3d: Like: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/11/
[08:33:25] <SnackWhack> close, but not working...
[08:33:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/AeuEV/12/
[08:35:03] <SnackWhack> Whirl3d: looking good.... thanks. Let's see if I can wire up the rest
[08:36:03] <Whirl3d> I usually try to stay away from complicated pseudo-selectors like :nth-child. Not always possible, but I try.
[08:36:36] <gigamonkey> What is the development-bundle directory in a jquery-ui download just for hacking on jquery-ui itself?
[08:36:48] <gigamonkey> er, s/What //
[08:36:55] <SnackWhack> It just didn't come to me to do it the way you did. Lack of experience
[08:37:32] <Whirl3d> Different perspectives, man. I'm not saying mine is better, just different.
[08:40:30] <SnackWhack> Whirl3d: Working in both browsers, so I'm happier!
[08:41:03] <gnarf> SnackWhack: why not just bind to form submit? http://jsfiddle.net/88Mrx/
[08:41:48] <SnackWhack> gnarf: As mentioned, there are multiple forms on the page, none of which are named. And, I can't touch the code that generates the tables and forms
[08:42:07] <Whirl3d> now, when gnarf makes a suggestion, it's safe to say that his _is_ better...lol
[08:42:09] <gnarf> SnackWhack: so what makes that form special?
[08:42:24] <gnarf> is it the only one with a table for instance?
[08:42:26] <SnackWhack> It's the only form that has a 'Save' button
[08:43:05] <gnarf> $("form").has("input[value='save']").submit()
[08:43:19] <gnarf> or something similar seems like a better approach anyway
[08:43:34] <SnackWhack> exxactly... I'm just still learning to form those selectors
[08:43:38] <gnarf> binding to form submit is smarter, especially if there are more thn just the "save" as inputs
[08:44:10] <gnarf> SnackWhack: although realisitics, the most performant selector is an ID
[08:44:40] <gnarf> so if you COULD convince the form generator to add a <form id="thisForm"> it would be easier to target
[08:44:47] <cliffordmeece> I'm trying to make a custom draggable behavior.  I want the dragged object to be the original element (or maybe a clone) until the object is over a particular droppable.  Then I want the helper to morph into a completely different element.  This behavior is similar to the effect that many desktop operating systems use when dragging files.  For example, the dragged files may originally look like the icons you selected,
[08:44:47] <cliffordmeece> but when hovered over a folder, they may 'collapse' into a 'stack' of icons. (the Mac finder does this, for example).
[08:44:49] <SnackWhack> gnarf: I know, and if I could modify the baseline code, I would
[08:45:02] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/18/
[08:45:27] <gnarf> SnackWhack: i understand arbitrary limitations like that - I also try my best to fight them every time they happen :)
[08:45:48] <gnarf> SnackWhack: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/19/
[08:45:50] <SnackWhack> gnarf: I do too, but in this case, the policy isn't going to bend
[08:46:02] <Whirl3d> cliffordmeece, I would suggest styling your "helper" element with a :hover pseudo class in CSS
[08:46:23] <cliffordmeece> it's more than just css
[08:46:38] <cliffordmeece> i need the elements to change quite drastically
[08:47:22] <Whirl3d> And you can't use the "sprite" concept where :hover displaces the background image, giving the element a completely different appearance?
[08:47:27] <cliffordmeece> a complicating issue is that i also have custom start, move and end functions on the draggable, as I am also dragging 'children' elements (it's a tree of nodes i am dragging)
[08:47:44] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: Thanks to the folks who volunteered to help us test the new ThemeRollerâ€¦access emails are en route! â˜… http://bit.ly/HvvPJP
[08:47:44] <gnarf> cliffordmeece: mucking with the size of the helper in a UI draggable is a little dangerous
[08:47:59] <gnarf> cliffordmeece: that doesn't mean impossible... its just troublesome
[08:48:38] <cliffordmeece> ideally i want to just do a wholesale swap of the ui.draggable, storing the original and hiding it and generating a completely new one.
[08:48:40] <gnarf> cliffordmeece: but - best bet is to use the same HTML, just apply a different class to the container on the draggable helper
[08:49:33] <cliffordmeece> ok, I'll see if I can do that
[08:49:36] <gnarf> cliffordmeece: there is a callback that is called when the helper is created... I don't really remember how... but you could prep it with the "collapsed" state
[08:50:18] <cliffordmeece> right, I guess I could also include an html element that represents the collapsed state, that is always present
[08:50:22] <cliffordmeece> but hidden
[08:50:32] <cliffordmeece> and then toggle visibility
[08:50:35] <cliffordmeece> on the hover
[08:50:38] <gnarf> cliffordmeece: yeah - that might work
[08:50:51] <cliffordmeece> ok, thanks guys, always helps to have a sounding board
[08:50:56] <gnarf> its just a tricky bit of code to balance
[08:51:36] <SnackWhack> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/21/ < I added all the buttons that are on the form, and no matter which button is pushed, the alert shows. I guess I need to check for the button value?
[08:52:09] <gnarf> SnackWhack: form submission is form submission... if there is more than one submit button...
[08:52:18] <gnarf> well, you kinda lose it on the submit handle
[08:52:49] <gnarf> those probably shouldn't be "submit" buttons
[08:52:57] <gnarf> but again, not your fault :)
[08:53:11] <SnackWhack> gnarf: right, I just have to find the work around
[08:53:13] <gnarf> especially the "reset" button, that should totally be a type="reset" :)
[08:53:27] <gnarf> so you have multiple buttons
[08:54:15] <SnackWhack> yes, and I guess it doesn't matter. Form submission is form submission.
[08:54:38] <gnarf> SnackWhack: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/22/
[08:55:05] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/23/
[08:55:31] <gnarf> ^^^ note that "this" refers to the button clicked, so you could use that to figure out which button is clicked and do whatever magic you need to
[08:55:37] <SnackWhack> That's an interesting approach
[08:56:37] <surfdue> I want to use this font resizer plugin http://www.thesheep.co.uk/examples/font-resizer/ but im trying to find out how i can wrap it to work with jquery.noConflict. Any advice or content I can read over?
[08:57:11] <Hawkee> why would my UI widget local var be "NaN" rather than an integer?
[08:57:38] <alexr2> whatever you're setting it to is probably not a number hawkee
[08:57:43] <alexr2> that's all i can tell from what you've given us
[08:57:46] <SnackWhack> ok, I like that. Here's the magic, and my next chance to fall on my face. I know the ID of the person logged in. And I need to prevent the form from submitting if that person checks the "Approve or FYI" checkbox. eg. - John Doe is logged in, he checks the 'Approve or FYI' check box, and then clicks Save. He shouldn't be allowed to approve himself, so the form alerts him and prevents submission
[08:57:53] <Hawkee> hmm, okay
[08:58:21] <NoiseEee> SnackWhack: cheap/hacky for the front end, but that's the back ends job
[08:58:25] <alexr2> if you want more help than that, use jsfiddle.net and put in some code we can look at
[08:58:36] <SnackWhack> NoiseEee: The backend code is already in place
[08:59:26] <NoiseEee> SnackWhack: so maybe check against a cookie value on submission, and stop the event if its not what you want
[08:59:42] <SnackWhack> I wish I had more control over all the code. This non-compliant spaghetti code is years old, I just have to limp along for a little longer. Major upgrade coming soon
[09:00:21] <surfdue> any ideas?
[09:00:25] <Hawkee> okay, it seems I wasn't delcaring it properly under this.myvar
[09:01:08] <SnackWhack> NoiseEee: I'm going to have to look at the checkbox on every line, if it's checked, then compare the ID to that cookie value. Here's what gnarf has helped me with so far:

[09:01:55] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: what i do in this situation is have a simple click handler on all the buttons
[09:02:01] <ajpiano> that stores which button was last click in the form's data
[09:02:18] <surfdue> whoops sorry
[09:02:40] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: no can do, I can't touch the code that generates this HTML
[09:02:48] <ajpiano> you don't have to
[09:03:41] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/25/
[09:05:19] <SnackWhack> http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/26/
[09:05:32] <SnackWhack> That's working too. Is there a reason to use one method over the other?
[09:06:06] <Hawkee> alright, so I'm using localStorage to cache appended endless scroll results so you can click and go back to where you were
[09:06:17] <Hawkee> my question is how long should I hold on to this data
[09:06:20] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: it doesn't actually work.
[09:06:30] <Hawkee> I'm thinking once another endless scroll instance is created I just clear the previous
[09:06:36] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: preventing the default action of the click doesn't have anything to do with preventing the actual form submission
[09:07:00] <Hawkee> but I also need to consider clearing it if there is new data
[09:07:03] <JavaLover> is the genius still here?
[09:07:54] <JavaLover> whirl3d: i just want you to know my error i solved it
[09:08:09] <JavaLover> whirl3d: the guys code was actually perfectly fine, it's just that he was checking to see the size of an element
[09:08:23] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: I thought 'return false' would kill the form submission. No?
[09:08:31] <JavaLover> whirl3d: i had my element display value as none at the wrong time..so first time it was visible, 2nd time it was not causing lionbars to fail
[09:08:45] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: where is there a return false in /26
[09:08:48] <JavaLover> whirl3d: i fixed it & now it works everytime, but i wanted to thank you for the lesson & for taking the time ty so much!
[09:09:00] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/29/
[09:10:10] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/31/ < it's there now
[09:11:13] <JavaLover> dear everyone, when using lionbars make sure you have ur object displayed otherwise it'll mess up haha anyways enjoy everyone :-)
[09:11:45] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: hum, whaddya know, it works.
[09:12:10] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: to the extent that it's possible, i just prefer to manage the submit event in the submit event, not the click event on the submit button
[09:12:16] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: I think either way works fine. I'm just not sure one method is better than the other
[09:12:24] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: gotcha
[09:15:39] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: gnarf: So here's the latest code: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/34/ <- Next question is what I mentioned. I need to look at each line in that table (There are more tables, I need the one that shows 'Pending' in the forst row and column). I then need to look at the check boxes under 'Approve or FYI', and if that's checked, prevent form submission if the ID on that row matches some arbitrary value I have in a cookie, or variabl
[09:16:09] <ajpiano> gotcha
[09:16:10] <SnackWhack> Whew.... gnarly business rules
[09:16:15] <Hawkee> Cork, you're right there is a pause when the localStorage is very full
[09:16:25] <ajpiano> i can mock it up for you
[09:16:33] <Pupeno_W> Anyone having draggables that are dropped in a nestedSortable?
[09:16:40] <Hawkee> so I need to clear it often
[09:17:23] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: If you would be so kind. Has taken me 3 hours to get this far lol
[09:18:46] <ccohn> Given $(".someclass a").parent().hide(), how can I return to my original selector for chaining additional functions?
[09:18:54] <ajpiano> ?end @ ccohn
[09:18:55] <bot-t> ccohn, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[09:19:04] <ccohn> Thanks greatly
[09:20:23] <c0d3rg1rl> Is http://api.jquery.com down?
[09:21:01] <ajpiano> it seems to be running slowly
[09:21:04] <ajpiano> danheberden: you there?
[09:21:14] <ajpiano> i think api.jquery needs a firm punch in the throat
[09:21:30] <c0d3rg1rl> or less punches, maybe a ddos
[09:21:49] <danheberden> ajpiano: ya
[09:24:08] <ajpiano> SnackWhack: http://jsfiddle.net/AeuEV/35/
[09:25:24] <SnackWhack> ... Dave... lol
[09:25:37] <SnackWhack> ajpiano: ty vm, that would have taken me hours to figure out
[09:27:34] <ajpiano> you are welcome
[09:29:49] <Hawkee> what's a better name: infinite scroll, endless scroll, scroll append?
[09:30:03] <Hawkee> trying to come up with a name for my widget
[09:30:17] <Hawkee> infinite scroll and endless scroll are both taken, but I just don't know how to describe this otherwise
[09:30:19] <SnackWhack> I would think append
[09:30:40] <SnackWhack> loopyscrollywidgetythingy
[09:30:40] <Hawkee> yeah, I was thinking Scroll Append is good because it's unique
[09:30:50] <Hawkee> nobody's using that name yet
[09:31:35] <Hawkee> Scroll Append now with Cache
[09:32:06] <c0d3rg1rl> Hawkee: is this something like google images?
[09:32:13] <Hawkee> c0d3rg1rl, yes
[09:32:17] <Hawkee> exactly
[09:32:25] <Hawkee> I'm releasing a widget
[09:32:34] <c0d3rg1rl> nice
[09:32:38] <Hawkee> just considering what to name it
[09:34:37] <Hawkee> hmm, never see this site before.. coderwall
[09:34:39] <Hawkee> anybody use it?
[09:34:56] <c0d3rg1rl> Hawkee: is there a demo of your scroller somewhere?
[09:35:18] <Hawkee> c0d3rg1rl, not the current version.. but I'm using the previous version on my site
[09:35:20] <SnackWhack> I've not used coderwall
[09:35:22] <Hawkee> hawkee.com
[09:35:36] <Hawkee> this is the first I've seen of coderwall, sounds interesting
[09:36:34] <SnackWhack> I like that you can get achievments
[09:36:39] <Hawkee> c0d3rg1rl, I'll release this shortly so keep an eye out on my site
[09:36:49] <Hawkee> I've been considering offering achievements for some time
[09:37:00] <Hawkee> I have a "like" economy that may profit from it
[09:38:05] <SnackWhack> I need achievements on my site... might bring in a few more people
[09:38:19] <Hawkee> what's your site?
[09:38:37] <SnackWhack> http://infinitesearchspace.dyndns.org/
[09:38:56] <foo> If I include jquery in the body of the page, is it the end of the world?
[09:39:02] <foo> (eg. first thing in the body)
[09:39:08] <sqwk> Can someone tell my why this: http://pastie.org/3762932 does not show the first option for the select? It's ithere and I can select it after I selected another option, it is even shown as ticked when opening the select, but the text is not displayed when the pages is loaded
[09:39:52] <Hawkee> SnackWhack, ah a challenge site
[09:40:01] <SnackWhack> Hawkee: indeed
[09:40:03] <Hawkee> I've held coding challenges in the past, hard to maintain though
[09:40:32] <SnackWhack> Hawkee: Currently on my second one, and it runs itself. I put a lot of work into the framework. I barely touch the site
[09:40:47] <SnackWhack> Current contest ends in 3 days
[09:42:13] <fission6> anyone have a recommendation for jquery and google maps, looking to plot some markers and activate hovers over markers based on if the user hovers over a location
[09:48:44] <DaveJ|UK> Is there any built in functionality to create a reusable ajax object where I only change the bits that change with each request (url, data and success callback)?
[09:49:51] <DaveJ|UK> .ajaxSetup()?
[09:51:48] <RPkS> I'm looking for a logical way to have a button open a window when it's clicked. Then the window closes if the button or the text/image is clicked.
[09:52:22] <blindMoe> could you use a modal box instead of a window?
[09:53:34] <RPkS> Hi blindMoe ...I've learned so #### much since we last spoke, but modal box has flew over my head. LOL Let me look it up real quick.
[09:54:24] <blindMoe> RPkS: there are a bunch of plugins to help create modal boxes... jquery UI also has it built in
[09:55:08] <danzik17> DaveJ|UK: there's shortcuts for like $.post and $.get which for the cases you just mentioned.
[09:55:14] <danzik17> fit*
[09:56:17] <RPkS> blindMoe: I don't want it use pure css the way this link has the 2 boxes, but I want them to behave similar. http://css-tricks.com/examples/FoldOutPopup/
[09:56:45] <RPkS> blindMoe: More Dogs and the link example
[09:57:21] <gnarf> SnackWhack: 3 days?
[09:57:35] <gnarf> i could write that in jsFiddle in that time prolly :)
[09:57:39] <RPkS> blindMoe: I think it would be smart to add Shipping and Return info right there in the Call to Action area
[09:57:48] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Well, 2 days, 12 hours, 1 minute, 54 seconds until
[09:58:06] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Go for it! I'd love to see it
[09:58:17] <gnarf> SnackWhack: its a fun game, I wrote it for NeXT in like 96
[09:58:31] <blindMoe> RPkS: there are a lot of plugins to do popups like that
[09:59:47] <gnarf> http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/NEXTSTEP/Apps/Games/Hopeless.1.5.README heh
[10:02:22] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Old school! :)
[10:02:56] <SeanFallon> has anyone used this plug-in? http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2011/12/21/jquery-accordion-slideshow-wordpress-plugin/ I am trying to manipulate the heighth and the length of the over all accordion slideshow, and it won't cooperate with me ,haha. Needing an extra pair of eyes.
[10:03:53] <SeanFallon> I've tried the .js files and even went as far as the html and css.
[10:04:14] <boblet> re: jQueryUI drag-n-drop, is it possible to have a dynamic droppable() target? I want to eg make one element each side of the element being dragged into drop targets. using a variable like $( dynamic-target ).droppable(); doesnâ€™t seem to workâ€¦
[10:07:39] <boblet> (I was creating the variable in a draggable() start function fwiw)
[10:09:09] <SeanFallon> nvm
[10:09:11] <SeanFallon> fixed it.
[10:09:18] <SeanFallon> Thanks for anyone who tried to look at it.
[10:11:28] <boblet> doh, I needed to move the droppable() code into the draggable() start function
[10:11:56] <SeanFallon> heh, looks like we both solved our own problems on that one
[10:11:57] <SeanFallon> LOL
[10:23:42] <SnackWhack> Q: http://jsfiddle.net/kajzb/ <- Perhaps it's a scoping issue, but see "alert('Global ID = '||$global_id);" about 1/2 way down? Well, that always shows blank for the $global_id. Even though the $global_id is being set in the ajax call, as verified by the alert
[10:26:23] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Just getting your attention....
[10:27:08] <DerekPioneer> have a list like <li>one</li> <li>two</li>, etc. when the user clicks on "two" how do i get the current child (for "two", the current child count would be 2 because "two" is the second in the list)
[10:28:04] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: I'm tempted to say .index(), but I always have to look at the docs for thatone
[10:28:08] <johnkpaul> ?index

[10:28:52] <johnkpaul> no problem, make sure you read those docs carefull
[10:28:56] <johnkpaul> carefully*
[10:30:32] <boblet> SeanFallon: funny how writing it down helps clarify it or make it easier to search for huh

[10:33:47] <DerekPioneer> ty SnackWhack
[10:34:17] <SnackWhack> np

[10:40:21] <dannyzb> Anyone wants file management (php/jquery + Amazon S3 ) code before I delete it forever ?
[10:40:59] <thang> go on..
[10:41:08] <blindMoe> dannyzb: sure
[10:41:16] <blindMoe> why would you delete it forever?
[10:41:29] <dannyzb> It's a service I've written for facebook .. insane amounts of code
[10:41:35] <blindMoe> oh
[10:41:35] <dannyzb> never found time to put into business development
[10:41:38] <blindMoe> hrmm nm then
[10:41:47] <blindMoe> well.. fsck it
[10:41:49] <blindMoe> I'll take it
[10:42:15] <dannyzb> theres one catch : it's super complex , and I never found time to simplify it enough for open source
[10:42:19] <dannyzb> I'll send you a rar file
[10:42:48] <DerekPioneer> dannyzb: ugly open source is better than none at all, right?
[10:42:59] <dannyzb> DerekPioneer : I'd LOVE to opensource it
[10:43:04] <SnackWhack> gnarf: So close now. I verified $global_id is being assigned properly, and then copied that down to the "inArray" part you wrote. http://jsfiddle.net/kajzb/1/ < But that's not catching it in the compare.
[10:43:28] <dannyzb> you guys can do whatever you want with the code I don't mind
[10:46:37] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Oh yeah... the code: http://jsfiddle.net/kajzb/1/
[10:46:53] <SnackWhack> Line in question: isInvalidApproval = $.inArray( $global_id, approvals ) > -1;
[10:47:29] <SnackWhack> I know $global_id is assigned at that point, but it's evaluating to 0
[10:48:12] <SnackWhack> no, it's evaluating to -1
[10:50:38] <SnackWhack> nm, got it
[10:50:47] <SnackWhack> there was white space in $global
[10:50:50] <SnackWhack> there was white space in $global_id
[10:55:18] <arussel> I'm trying to get the Bar of : <button id="foo">Bar</button>
[10:55:35] <arussel> $('#foo').html() gives  #<HTMLButtonElement> has no method 'html'
[10:55:58] <dannyzb> arussel: thats because it doesn't
[10:56:03] <dannyzb> it only has text content
[10:57:06] <dannyzb> what do you need the HTML for ?
[11:00:38] <gnarf> dannyzb: untrue
[11:00:48] <gnarf> arussel: chances are $ is not jQuery
[11:01:40] <dannyzb> gnarf: woah .. my bad .. I was never here (:
[11:01:59] <SnackWhack> Is trim() not supported in IE? This works in Chrome, but errors in IE: $global_id = response.trim();
[11:02:01] <gnarf> dannyzb: <button>2<sub>abc</sub></button> is totally legal
[11:02:11] <dannyzb> gnarf : it's legal but useless
[11:02:17] <SnackWhack> if I remove the trim, it don't see an error anymore in IE
[11:02:19] <dannyzb> gnarf: IE8 ignores the HTML content anyway
[11:04:32] <gnarf> dannyzb: are you sure about that?
[11:04:34] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/64shV/
[11:04:40] <arussel> gnarf: I'm sure it is, I'm in a jquery datatables.
[11:04:40] <SnackWhack> nm
[11:04:54] <gnarf> arussel: console.log( $ instanceof jQuery )
[11:05:17] <dannyzb> gnarf : I'm on my MAC so I can't test that
[11:05:20] <dannyzb> gnarf : http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp
[11:05:34] <dannyzb> "different browsers may submit different values. Internet Explorer, prior version 9, will submit the text between the <button> and </button> tags, while other browsers will submit the content of the value attribute."
[11:05:37] <gnarf> dannyzb: http://cl.ly/1f2l341x3e2H0f223Q2E
[11:05:47] <gnarf> thats just the "submission" value
[11:05:53] <dannyzb> oh .. I got that backwards
[11:06:45] <dannyzb> anyway , it's one of those values where it's not cross-platform at all
[11:06:49] <gnarf> dannyzb: i also am on my mac, but browserstack rules
[11:07:03] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/0s293S3Z0q1O1b3A3t1Q dannyzb
[11:07:09] <gnarf> even ie 7 renders them correctly
[11:07:53] <dannyzb> I never tested it out but I remember something about the button tags from browser specs ><
[11:07:56] <gnarf> oh wait... so does THE DEVIL ITSELF: http://cl.ly/1f3p3q2A2F1X1D0Y0p1I
[11:08:10] <gnarf> dannyzb: html inside <button> is 100% legal
[11:08:17] <gnarf> and seemingly supported even in IE6
[11:08:19] <gnarf> so
[11:08:20] <gnarf> ....
[11:08:40] <dannyzb> I remember a browser or two that used the value inside "Value"
[11:08:47] <dannyzb> don't care enough to test which lol

[11:09:24] <Marcosc> hi, I have a question about a promiseâ€¦.  I have the following (viewContainer is just a div):  $(viewContainer).fadeIn(speed); $(viewContainer).promise().done( function () {â€¦})

[11:09:52] <Marcosc> The problem I am having is the the promise calls "done", but done gets called over and over again
[11:10:11] <gnarf> Marcosc: is there a reason you need it as a promise?
[11:10:31] <chee> `i think you might be thinking of <input type="button">, dannyzb
[11:10:38] <gnarf> Marcosc: cuz .queue( function( next ) { next(); }); is a little better
[11:10:48] <dannyzb> perhaps .. perhaps ....
[11:11:01] <Marcosc> gnarf: I only want it called once
[11:11:17] <Marcosc> but it seems to "remember" the it

[11:11:32] <gnarf> Marcosc: ^^^
[11:12:06] <Marcosc> gnarf: I can try queue
[11:12:27] <gnarf> Marcosc: can you just put a demo of the code up on a fiddle?
[11:12:35] <gnarf> maybe i can see why you're getting multiple calls

[11:16:09] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use chosen?
[11:16:13] <dannyzb> RPsK : whats the problem with it ? just test it with the new jQuery
[11:16:22] <dannyzb> you can change the code for yourself on Chrome/Firefox

[11:18:54] <rogo> using jplayer to play an mp3 and trying to start an automatic scroll when the song loads, when i call the scrolling function through the jplayer constructor all the sudden my scroll function, which was smooth before is very choppy. does this make sense? is there a way around it?
[11:19:31] <dannyzb> rogo : does it stay smooth or is it smooth at that moment ?
[11:19:45] <dannyzb> it may just be because it's a double CPU load ( scroll + loading jplayer )
[11:19:57] <rogo> the entire scroll was smooth when i called it outside of the jplayer constructor
[11:20:19] <rogo> it's possible it's just cpu
[11:20:30] <dannyzb> I'm not too familiar with jPlayer myself but you can try to delay load until the scroll is complete
[11:20:52] <rogo> i didn't know if it was a bad idea to call an animating function from inside some constructor for something else
[11:21:21] <rogo> i need to use them together, i would rather delay the scroll and song play until the entire song is buffered
[11:21:36] <dannyzb> rogo : so do that ...
[11:21:52] <RPkS> dannyzb: sorry I missed your reply ... There isn't a problem, but I want to add a toggle effect and I'm not sure if 1.6.2 can use it. Please forgive me, but I am new to jquery.
[11:22:13] <rogo> dannyzb: i'm not entirely sure how but i'll keep digging in the dev guide before i come to irc, thanks!
[11:22:19] <dannyzb> RPsK : Updating jQuery is just a matter or using a different include file in the page
[11:22:36] <dannyzb> you can dynamically change the included file in the right browsers to test without touching the code your users use
[11:23:10] <RPkS> dannyzb: Do you know if 1.6.2 can use the toggle effect?
[11:23:50] <dannyzb> Yes ,it can
[11:25:37] <RPkS> well then I think I should leave upgrading for another time. I need to gain more experience before I mess with something I don't understand.
[11:25:54] <RPkS> dannyzb: Thank you for the help!
[11:26:02] <dannyzb> you're welcome (:
[11:29:37] <arussel> gnarf: thanks for your help, I was in jquery but not getting the node properly
[11:30:10] <Marcosc> gnarf: can't reproduce (i.e., promise().done() works as expected in jsFiddle. Must be something else then)
[11:30:25] <ProLoser|Work> THIS IS WAAAAY BETTER THAN CHOSEN: http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[11:30:50] <Marcosc> gnarf: thanks for your help. If I make any progress but get stuck will return :)
[11:32:33] <dannyzb> gnarf : if Qt has an error in the call stack , can it effect other calls ?
[11:32:41] <dannyzb> ie . have anything to do with what he has
[11:33:56] <blindMoe> ProLoser|Work: select2 looks great
[11:34:09] <ProLoser|Work> i've been struggling to add all that functionality to chosen for a while
[11:34:16] <ProLoser|Work> then i stumbled upon this and found the guy did everything already
[11:34:24] <ProLoser|Work> templating, infinite scroll, ajax, entry modification
[11:34:27] <blindMoe> looks very useful
[11:34:30] <ProLoser|Work> it's fucking miraculous, i need to cry
[11:34:42] <blindMoe> yeah the ajax autocomplete and search w/ infinite scroll is perfect
[11:34:51] <ProLoser|Work> i've been having to do that myself for a while
[11:34:52] <ProLoser|Work> is a HUGE pain
[11:35:44] <blindMoe> gonna need to wrap that up as a Yii extensions to use
[11:36:11] <ProLoser|Work> Yii?
[11:36:17] <blindMoe> php framework
[11:36:35] <ProLoser|Work> do you normally wrap jquery plugins in php?
[11:36:39] <blindMoe> select2 would make a great addition
[11:36:46] <ProLoser|Work> i know a few cases people did that for cakephp, it just seems like poor design
[11:36:56] <blindMoe> ProLoser|Work: only when using Yii and when it is a quality plugin
[11:37:27] <ProLoser|Work> it creates a form of redundancy though, and dual chains of development, falls out of sync (and vicariously, out of date) faster
[11:38:40] <blindMoe> ProLoser|Work: not a big deal to me.. just makes it easier to tie in specific framework functions
[11:38:59] <blindMoe> bbiaf
[11:40:27] <ProLoser|Work> is it common practice to do something like this? https://github.com/drosen0/select2/commit/12a3e68256cc0dd0aaa2e13275d3e15fb80cecf1
[11:40:28] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on select2 by drosen0 (57m, 41s ago): Update select2.js
[11:45:00] <youngin> Eviltwin: u up and about mate?
[11:45:02] <WebDragon> ok for the slidebar creation inside wordpress the content area in the post gets wrapped in a div within the aside container
[11:45:23] <WebDragon> what I want to do is to find the image that's inside the div and move it to the parent aside container so it's within the aside but outside the div
[11:46:23] <WebDragon> so I have slideitems.each( function () { $(this).find("img").addClass("roundedbox"); ... how do I move it to its parent container after adding the class
[11:47:22] <abnormalex> does any1 use or recommend ckeditor or tinymce?
[11:47:23] <WebDragon> otherwise it winds up inside the background-wrapper of the text (which via metabox selection can be positioned bottom in the slide with a light/dark background and which shouldn't in that case be wrapping the image)
[11:47:30] <abnormalex> Im succesfully saving my content to MySQL with CKE, but I can't populate the editor with content from my database with PHP
[11:47:39] <Phoenixz> If I have an HTML snippet, I should be able to do $(snippet).find('someid'), correct? I have this, I have a snippet, and then a for(id in translationList){$(snippet).find(id).text(translationList[id]); } but for some reason, only some 3-4 elements are found by find() (and so, translated), the rest not..
[11:47:45] <Phoenixz> What might be the reason for jQuery .find() not finding all elements in a snippet?
[11:47:53] <Eildydar> How would I go about removing all options but the first one in jquery?
[11:48:34] <WebDragon> I'm guessing I would use .detatch() instead of .remove() ?
[11:48:44] <warrenparsons> Phoenix, please provide an example on jsfiddle.net
[11:48:44] <DannyZB> WebDragon: otherelement = theelement you want
[11:49:01] <DannyZB> then you use detach to remove it ( acts exactly like remove but doesn't break jQuery stuff )
[11:49:13] <WebDragon> DannyZB: yeah, I was just reading up on that
[11:49:19] <WebDragon> I should be able to chain this.
[11:49:32] <DannyZB> yea it's pretty basic
[11:49:52] <DannyZB> you copy ( appendTo) then remove the old element ( detach )
[11:50:35] <WebDragon> $(this).find("img").addClass("roundedbox").detach().parent().append() ? :)
[11:51:04] <DannyZB> WebDragon : overrrrchaining man lol it's barely readable
[11:51:08] <WebDragon> heh
[11:51:16] <WebDragon> maybe so but it's clear to me what that is supposed to do
[11:51:21] <DannyZB> http://www.elated.com/articles/jquery-removing-replacing-moving-elements/
[11:51:30] <DannyZB> better than explaining myself , use the code there (:
[11:51:33] <WebDragon> hehe thanks :)
[11:51:35] <warrenparsons> WebDragon: That will just append it right back into its original parent. You probably want an .end() between .detach() and .parent()
[11:51:51] <WebDragon> warrenparsons: ORLY. good to know
[11:52:13] <warrenparsons> WebDragon: Yep, .end() steps you one element up the chain, so it would essentially give you $(this).parent()
[11:52:26] <DannyZB> + you removed it from it's parent then asked for it's parent .. not sure how functioning that would be
[11:52:57] <WebDragon> aha
[11:53:00] <warrenparsons> WebDragon: Personally, I probably wouldn't write it as a single chain.
[11:53:16] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Good point.
[11:53:22] <DannyZB> again .. the tutorial I sent .. the exact code you need is there :
[11:53:24] <warrenparsons> I'd probably store the parent in a var first.
[11:53:42] <DannyZB>   // Remove and reattach #myDiv1's paragraph   var myDiv1Para = $('#myDiv1>p').remove();   myDiv1Para.appendTo('#myDiv1');    // Detach and reattach #myDiv2's paragraph   var myDiv2Para = $('#myDiv2>p').detach();   myDiv2Para.appendTo('#myDiv2');
[11:54:07] <DannyZB> the first is without preserving jQuery the second is with jQuery kept
[11:55:59] <DannyZB> Who here wanted the code for the file management / Amazon S3 / Facebook code ?
[11:56:32] <abnormalex> can any1 suggest how to save my content to database with ckeditor, to maintain formatting
[11:57:15] <abnormalex> is this killing my formatting?
[11:57:15] <abnormalex> $contentBody = filter_var($_POST['contentBody'], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
[11:57:18] <DannyZB> For opensourcing I would split it into several systems : 1. the windowing system ( written from the bottom up ) 2. File viewer ( Code, Images, Archive preview, text , video , audio player ) 3. Amazon S3 jQuery binding ( PHP ) 4. Facebook binding
[11:58:46] <catcher> I need to make a news ticker that pulls headlines from my DB. Where's the breaking point of when to use AJAX vs spitting them out on the page and cycling through them?
[11:58:55] <DannyZB> "sanitize string" - Strip tags, optionally strip or encode special characters
[11:58:58] <DannyZB> ofcourse it does
[11:59:03] <DannyZB> it intentionally strips HTML
[11:59:09] <catcher> I realize entries that are brand new wouldn't show up until page reload without AJAX, and that's okay.
[11:59:33] <DannyZB> abnormalex: but not using it would make you susceptible to injections , are your users accessing this page ?
[11:59:51] <sveri> hi, i have a table with some inputs inside it (no form), now i want to sent the data from the inputs via ajax to my backend, what is the best way to collect that data?
[12:00:04] <abnormalex> DannyZB: technically no, its just admins in the back end
[12:00:07] <piklu> ppl registering new domains can do it at 2.95 - network solutions running a deal for .com's, .net's and .orgs
[12:00:14] <DannyZB> so don't use any function like that ..
[12:00:33] <DannyZB> but I would suggest you use SQL stripping / restoring when displayed
[12:00:50] <DannyZB> otherwise if you use quotes in the document your SQL would break
[12:01:23] <DannyZB> sveri : you're better off using JSON and not pure AJAX
[12:01:31] <DannyZB> it's a much cleaner way to transfer data
[12:01:59] <sphinxxx> sveri: .serialize()
[12:02:10] <sveri> DannyZB: i am afraid i am not sure what you mean exactly?
[12:02:17] <sveri> sphinxxx: can i serialize a complete table?
[12:02:23] <sphinxxx> just make it a form
[12:02:27] <sphinxxx> around the table
[12:02:34] <sveri> sphinxxx: ah, true, easy :D
[12:02:41] <sveri> sphinxxx: thank you
[12:02:55] <DannyZB> sveri : Ajax is meant for transferring displayable content / unformatted content . JSON is like ajax except it transfers data in it's original form ( variables ) cross-platform
[12:03:34] <DannyZB> but serialize is also good (:
[12:03:44] <sveri> DannyZB: how can i transfer json with jquery?
[12:04:05] <DannyZB> is your data simple form data or do you have any complex data ? (tables etc' )
[12:04:35] <sveri> DannyZB: just text, boolean and datetime
[12:04:45] <DannyZB> oh so use serialize .. it's easier in that case
[12:05:02] <sveri> DannyZB: sphinxxx thank you, i'll do that
[12:05:51] <DannyZB> who here wanted the code I talked about earlier ?
[12:05:58] <DannyZB> I'm seriously a minute from deleting it lol
[12:06:33] <abnormalex> DannyZB: ive modified to $contentBody = $_POST['contentBody'];
[12:06:44] <abnormalex> its keeping my html syntax for ckeditor, is it safe?
[12:07:03] <DannyZB> abnormalex : it's the opposite of safe , once you put that in a query it would break
[12:07:41] <abnormalex> DannyZB: what do you mean it would break?
[12:07:42] <rogo> how can i get my scrolling function to print the scroll height continuously - http://jsfiddle.net/A2s9Q/
[12:07:45] <abnormalex> its working perfect...
[12:07:54] <abnormalex> im just not sure if its secure
[12:07:57] <DannyZB> use $contentBody = mysql_real_escape_string ($_POST['contentBody']));
[12:08:04] <WebDragon> warrenparsons: DannyZB: 			var img = $(this).find("img").addClass("roundedbox"); var thiswrapper = img.parent().parent(); img.detach().prependTo(thiswrapper);
[12:08:08] <WebDragon> works perfect
[12:08:48] <abnormalex> DannyZB: im not using mysql statements
[12:08:54] <abnormalex> im using PDO prepared statements
[12:09:04] <abnormalex> but doesnt real_escape_string get rid of html syntax?
[12:09:13] <abnormalex> im trying to keep my formating for CKEditor
[12:09:18] <NoiseEee> language confusing.
[12:09:20] <DannyZB> abnormalex : yes it does , but you can revert that on display
[12:09:23] <PavelloZ|home> var img = $(this).find("img").addClass("roundedbox");
[12:09:25] <abnormalex> how?
[12:09:25] <DannyZB> WebDragon : great
[12:09:31] <PavelloZ|home> hmmm
[12:09:42] <PavelloZ|home> is this me or this is somehow wrong?
[12:09:42] <DannyZB> abnormalex : nvm , you're not using mysql so maybe it's not a problem with your queries
[12:09:43] <NoiseEee> also real_escape_string in php most definetely does not get rid of html syntax, but ##php
[12:09:57] <DannyZB> abnormalex : can -only- your admins touch that page ?
[12:10:00] <WebDragon> PavelloZ|home: I did it that way because adding images in wordpress doesn't always add the extra class I need it to have within a slide bar
[12:10:02] <WebDragon> ;)
[12:10:18] <warrenparsons> WebDragon: Cool man.
[12:10:23] <WebDragon> I have a custom post type with meta-boxes for text placement/background
[12:10:33] <abnormalex> DannyZB: i am using mysql, but im using PDO not mysql statements
[12:10:34] <WebDragon> makes a very nice slider interface to add homepage slides
[12:10:44] <WebDragon> gonna be schexy when it's finished
[12:10:48] <abnormalex> and technically yeah just admins, but we might have a lot... would be nice to learn the proper wa
[12:10:49] <abnormalex> way
[12:10:56] <WebDragon> so far it's just http://360.client-proof.com/
[12:11:08] <DannyZB> abnormalex : once you give someone access to HTML , you give him a way to do javascript injections
[12:11:14] <WebDragon> (still tweaking IE so if you're on IE don't bother loading ;)
[12:11:18] <DannyZB> the only way to avoid that is to properly protect page access (:
[12:11:37] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquery: Getting Touchy About Patents: http://t.co/luVEUZuM â˜… http://bit.ly/HIdPXq
[12:11:58] <warrenparsons> WebDragon: Just a style thing I like to use: I prefix any var that contains a jQuery object with $. So in your case if "img" is a jQuery object, which it is, I'd write it as - var $img = $(this).find('img')â€¦ Makes it easier for me to keep straight whether a var contains a jQuery object or a native DOM element/data/etc.

[12:12:49] <DannyZB> Last call to the public : who here would want code for Amazon S3 access for free , with a DWTFYWWI ( do whatever the fuck you want with it ) license as long as you can handle ugly code lol ?
[12:13:34] <abnormalex> what does that mean? amazon s3 code for free
[12:14:24] <DannyZB> it means I had a huge huge project 5 months ago that I abandoned after completion
[12:14:30] <DannyZB> now I have a heap of code thats going to get lost forever
[12:14:51] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Why not put it up on Github?
[12:15:10] <abnormalex> whats the code even do?
[12:15:11] <DannyZB> warrenparsons : I can never find enough time to clean up the code ><
[12:15:39] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Make it open source. It's the core of something valuable. Others can help clean it up.
[12:15:39] <abnormalex> is there a fast way with jQuery to go back last page?
[12:15:45] <DannyZB> It's a standalone / facebook addon jQuery app that lets you upload and manage files ( sent to an Amazon S3 server ) with a preview system built-in
[12:15:52] <abnormalex> or window.location.href='BACKONEPAGE';
[12:16:33] <DannyZB> I built a custom windowing system ( layered + transparecy + context menu ) and viewers for code ( only one that uses a good code highlighter on jQuery ) , an image viewer with pan/zoom and mini-pic + video viewer + music player
[12:17:08] <DannyZB> it's broken at the moment due to some Facebook API changes btw *
[12:18:01] <DannyZB> www.online-vault.net/Online-Vault.zip
[12:18:19] <DannyZB> you can see the code for yourself

[12:20:04] <mistica> hola
[12:20:21] <mistica> alguien quiere conversar conmigo
[12:20:35] <DannyZB> warrenparsons : Yea maybe , would love for that to happen .. the code is f*cking messed up though , really needs splitting into several modules
[12:21:36] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Code is never finished, right? If you don't have time to maintain it, put it out there with a note asking for help. If people see value in it, they can put in some effort to make it better. (Trying to follow my own advice hereâ€¦)
[12:22:21] <DannyZB> btw , there is one module I already edited , an image viewer with pan/zoom + thumbnail ( standalone )
[12:22:31] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Sure beats the hell out of just deleting it.
[12:23:15] <DannyZB> lol yea ... just frustrated a bit .. I 50% finished the code rewrite when I had to abandon it again
[12:24:18] <DannyZB> I'll git-it tomorrow
[12:24:56] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Cool.
[12:25:02] <abnormalex> hey, how can i say document.ready of an iframe
[12:25:22] <abnormalex> ckeditor uses an iframe, and sometimes my content doesnt load
[12:25:38] <sphinxxx> abnormalex:  window.load
[12:25:42] <DannyZB> abnormalex : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/205087/jquery-ready-in-a-dynamically-inserted-iframe
[12:25:43] <sphinxxx> will fire once iframe loads
[12:26:29] <SnackWhack> gnarf: Still here?
[12:26:31] <NoiseEee> sphinxxx: iirc the iframe loading is quite different than the document in the iframe loading.
[12:27:21] <gnarf> SnackWhack: sup?
[12:27:27] <abnormalex> sphinxxx: did you mean window.onload?
[12:28:02] <SnackWhack> I need a little more help retrieving a value. Given the following html: http://jsfiddle.net/dh2zW/1/ < I need to retrieve just that ID. Of course there are several other tables on the screen, so I need to find that one some how
[12:28:14] <sphinxxx> NoiseEee: but won't window load not fire until all frames are loaded?
[12:29:21] <SnackWhack> gnarf: (didnt prefix your name... reposting) I need a little more help retrieving a value. Given the following html: http://jsfiddle.net/dh2zW/1/ < I need to retrieve just that ID. Of course there are several other tables on the screen, so I need to find that one some how
[12:31:59] <DannyZB> snackwhack : how do you identify the table yourself? (whats unique about it )
[12:32:35] <DannyZB> that table only has a class , no ID
[12:32:51] <SnackWhack> DannyZB: The code I'm working with is terrible, but I can't change it. The only unique thing about it is that SUMMARY ta
[12:32:53] <SnackWhack> tag*
[12:33:53] <DannyZB> So use the summary tag ... ( in case you can promise it would never change )
[12:34:07] <DannyZB> better even if you somehow give the table a freakin ID lol
[12:34:16] <SnackWhack> Here's the complete HTML mockup: http://people.eku.edu/brewern/temp.html
[12:34:28] <SnackWhack> And I need to extract the 111222333 ID
[12:35:18] <DannyZB> SnackWhack is that always the first table on the page of that type ?
[12:35:35] <abnormalex> this not working
[12:35:35] <abnormalex> $(document).children(iframe).ready(function() {
[12:35:36] <abnormalex> or load
[12:36:02] <SnackWhack> DannyZB: no, there are other tables there. View source at that link I just sent
[12:36:09] <DannyZB> I am
[12:36:21] <sphinxxx> SnackWhack: use parseInt on the whole stringâ€¦ e.g.: parseInt("111222333 Jane A Doe")
[12:36:26] <DannyZB> abnormalex : maybe there isn't a way .. make sure your code is right before you decide that though
[12:36:35] <SnackWhack> that's the type of horrendous markup I have to deal with
[12:36:55] <SnackWhack> sphinxxx: will do, when I figure out how to get that string
[12:36:55] <DannyZB> SnackWhack : it's the first table of the class "datadisplaytable"
[12:37:03] <SnackWhack> DannyZB: ah, ok
[12:37:22] <DannyZB> it's dirty and you need to make sure nobody adds a table of that type before it , but it's a way
[12:37:38] <DannyZB> anyway you're better off adding an ID to that table if you have access to the PHP code
[12:37:41] <SnackWhack> it'll work until we upgrade
[12:37:58] <SnackWhack> it's PL/SQL, and I can't touch the delivered code
[12:38:16] <DannyZB> at least that way you know it wouldn't change without you knowing (: so it's ok
[12:38:19] <SnackWhack> Actually I could, but I'd break policy
[12:38:53] <sphinxxx> SnackWhack:  what exactly are you trying to get, every ID in every table?
[12:39:15] <SnackWhack> sphinxxx: No, just that id at the top
[12:39:20] <SnackWhack> 111222333 in this case
[12:39:23] <sphinxxx> and just this table?
[12:39:31] <SnackWhack> sphinxxx: yes
[12:40:52] <SnackWhack> so I need a selector that "find first table with class of datadisplaytable, and give me the first row, second column
[12:41:56] <DannyZB> $("datadisplaytable").first().children("dddefault","fieldformattext").html()
[12:42:03] <DannyZB> if I'm not mistaken (:
[12:42:37] <DannyZB> $("datadisplaytable").first().children("dddefault").first().children("fieldformattext").html() *
[12:42:38] <sphinxxx> SnackWhack:  isn't it just always the first?
[12:42:59] <SnackWhack> DannyZB: that returned null
[12:43:15] <DannyZB> one sec
[12:44:17] <DannyZB> maaan I'm rusty lol I'm fixing it
[12:44:19] <sphinxxx> SnackWhack:  http://jsfiddle.net/dh2zW/11/
[12:45:15] <DannyZB> OK something is off with this page .. $("table") is returning null
[12:45:38] <SnackWhack> boo yah, sphinxxx wins the race :)
[12:46:00] <DEADB33F> Does query have some method I can use to validate xml?
[12:46:02] <sphinxxx> although snack whack,  you should check it on a page with multiple tables
[12:46:15] <SnackWhack> sphinxxx: I did, I just tried it on the live page
[12:46:28] <DannyZB> SnackWhack : they are both OK
[12:46:34] <DannyZB> the page doesn't have jQuery in it lol
[12:46:42] <DannyZB> did you remember to include jQuery ?
[12:47:01] <SnackWhack> I tried your code, and sphinxxx on the live site.
[12:47:08] <SnackWhack> The live site has jquery
[12:47:10] <DannyZB> + I forgot the leading point for the classes ><
[12:47:37] <DannyZB> try $(".datadisplaytable").first().children(".dddefault").first().children(".fieldformattext").html()
[12:47:43] <JohnEl> How much do developer/designers charge for a salary position using jQuery?
[12:48:10] <DannyZB> JohnEl : depends on who your clients are .. I take 35$/hr but thats up for debate
[12:48:19] <SnackWhack> Well, I don't work in jQuery enough to charge anything. I should be invoiced from this channel
[12:48:27] <ThemNuts> sup guys, i got 3 inputfields from a birthday that get generated (can be as many as 10). When i select day of the first and enter 2 numbers i'd like it to jump to the next input (month) and focus. How can i achieve this?
[12:48:58] <SnackWhack> But, for standard web development, it's fair to charge anything from $20/hr, to $125/hr. Just depends on the client and project
[12:49:18] <DannyZB> JohnEl : simply put , the bigger the client the bigger the wage
[12:49:19] <ThemNuts> tried something with maxlenght and if($(this).val() == $(this).maxLenght) but doesn't work
[12:49:29] <JohnEl> i'm asking for $32k a year.
[12:50:10] <SnackWhack> JohnEl: My salary started around that, and now I pull over $50K
[12:50:12] <xmaddness> using jQuery and PHP?
[12:50:25] <xmaddness> for a full time position, 80K
[12:50:37] <DannyZB> xmaddness : not for a beginner ...
[12:50:41] <xmaddness> for a contract position $80/hr
[12:50:42] <JohnEl> jquery/php/css/python/django/javascript(of course)/linux/mysql/windows,etc,etc,etc
[12:50:47] <SnackWhack> then again, it depends on the cost of living
[12:50:48] <ThemNuts> i get 1.3M for pimping myself out
[12:50:48] <xmaddness> oh, well no not a beginner
[12:50:58] <JohnEl> i have 20 years experience programming.
[12:51:00] <SnackWhack> ThemNuts: stick with that
[12:51:06] <xmaddness> same
[12:51:06] <ThemNuts> i do
[12:51:10] <ThemNuts> i like older ladies
[12:51:14] <ThemNuts> lots of space :)
[12:51:19] <SnackWhack> ohhhh
[12:51:32] <ThemNuts> anywaaays
[12:51:35] * xmaddness loves his job
[12:51:47] <sphinxxx> johnel 32k/yr are you serious?
[12:51:50] <xmaddness> with 20 years of exp?
[12:51:55] <xmaddness> Do you have your CS degree?
[12:51:59] <JohnEl> sphinxxx: yes.
[12:52:02] <SnackWhack> You should expect no less than $50K
[12:52:12] <JohnEl> xmaddness: Actually I started programming in 84, but as a hobby.
[12:52:20] <xmaddness> ahh, okay so no paper?
[12:52:28] <NoiseEee> JohnEl: are you in the US?
[12:52:29] <JohnEl> xmaddness: I went from highschool to programming direct.
[12:52:32] <NoiseEee> a big city?
[12:52:33] <JohnEl> yes.
[12:52:34] <DannyZB> ThemNuts : check out http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[12:52:34] <xmaddness> I see
[12:52:35] <sphinxxx> degree doesn't matter, if you have skills you have skills
[12:52:35] <JohnEl> i'm in NY.
[12:52:42] <SnackWhack> lord, $70K easy
[12:52:52] <StevenCodes> sphinxxx,  I like ya style my man
[12:52:57] <xmaddness> sphinxxx, degrees get you in the door with major companies
[12:53:03] <DannyZB> lol .. In israel the taxes are so f*cking high it doesn't matter how much you make
[12:53:06] <sphinxxx> xmaddness: no, networking gets you in doors
[12:53:09] <NoiseEee> JohnEl: me thinks you're probably vastly underpaid etc
[12:53:15] <xmaddness> sphinxxx, they both do
[12:53:20] <SnackWhack> agree
[12:53:21] <xmaddness> /argument
[12:53:24] <JohnEl> I don't think so.
[12:53:40] <DannyZB> I'm thinking of getting a Bio-Medicine degree ... I know programming I don't need a f*cking degree for that
[12:53:43] <xmaddness> JohnEl, where are you located? Country
[12:53:44] <NoiseEee> DannyZB: hey, someone's gotta support the ultra-orthodox!
[12:53:45] <sphinxxx> its true school helps, but its a cost/benefit, certainly most kids paying 50k/year is not worth it
[12:53:45] <ThemNuts> DannyZB: yeah i found that one, thing is that i generate the inputs with JQ and i have multiple of the same
[12:54:19] <DannyZB> Universities aren't bad .. in the US they're just vastly overpriced
[12:54:22] <SnackWhack> how can I quickly compare 2 values and return true if they are the same, and false if not?
[12:54:27] <xmaddness> I paid 40K for my CS degree
[12:54:28] <DannyZB> NoiseEee: exactly .. seriously tired of that s*it
[12:54:28] <JohnEl> xmaddness: Your not familiar with the abbreviation of 'NY'?
[12:54:32] <xmaddness> erm well, I am paying
[12:54:36] <xmaddness> till i'm 60
[12:54:46] <xmaddness> JohnEl, I missed that
[12:54:47] <SnackWhack> like an iif: isInvalidApproval = iif(
[12:54:56] <johnkpaul> SnackWhack: ==
[12:54:58] <xmaddness> NY I would say easily 60-70K
[12:55:05] <johnkpaul> well, you need to define "same"
[12:55:06] <DannyZB> xmaddness : pity nobody told you you could get a degree nearly for free in germany (:
[12:55:17] <xmaddness> DannyZB, >_<
[12:55:25] <SnackWhack> isInvalidApproval = (val1 == val2) ... would that work... hmmm
[12:55:25] <DannyZB> they have so little technology majors they're practically begging for foreigners to join their schools
[12:56:00] <shoky> SnackWhack that's fine
[12:56:03] <johnkpaul> SnackWhack: yes, that should work
[12:56:09] <JohnEl> when I interview I get turned down alot.
[12:56:18] <johnkpaul> if the vals are primitives and you don't care about type coersion
[12:56:23] <JohnEl> Maybe because I want work someonewhere around where I live, or telecommute.
[12:56:42] <JohnEl> And I think I have too much Yang, which throws off the recruiters.
[12:56:43] <SnackWhack> I'm surprised, there's several German competitors on my site. And Russians. Which is also surprising since they are still working with really old computers
[12:57:00] <sphinxxx> this is my take on US student debt
[12:57:05] * SnackWhack works within walknig distance of  home.... and loves it
[12:57:08] <sphinxxx> function debt(val){debt(val++)} if(college.country == "US"){debt();}
[12:57:17] * DannyZB works from home (:
[12:57:29] <xmaddness> anyway, time to go play golf
[12:57:33] * DannyZB has olympus paying him right now which is good for the ego
[12:57:35] <SnackWhack> lol, infinitely recursive?
[12:57:56] <sphinxxx> precisely
[12:58:02] <DannyZB> lol lets move to africa and become mercenaries or smth
[12:58:16] <DannyZB> the west is only good for conjuring up debt
[12:58:39] * SnackWhack is buying land way out in the woods so he can bug out when the fit hits the shan
[12:58:52] <DannyZB> woo for oldschool
[12:59:18] <SnackWhack> 10 Print "Oldskool rocks!": 20 Goto 10
[12:59:28] <DannyZB> lol you work too much
[13:03:54] <SnackWhack> boo yah, fixed
[13:05:38] <SnackWhack> function debt(val){debt(val^2)} if(college.country == "US"){debt();} // I fixed it
[13:05:56] <DannyZB> lol
[13:06:01] <DannyZB> how about
[13:06:35] <DannyZB> function finish_him(debt) { if (debt > salary * 50) { GoPostal(); } }
[13:07:28] <SnackWhack> heh!
[13:08:21] <chovy> anyone hiring for a UI engineer in silicon valley?
[13:09:20] <SnackWhack> big ol' hiring freeze here
[13:09:41] <DannyZB> lol wrong place to look for work friend
[13:09:57] <DannyZB> elance.com sometimes has fulltime job offers
[13:10:03] <warrenparsons> Yahoo's going to be bleeding off people out there too.
[13:10:37] <SnackWhack> Had a friend recently get a job with HP near San Francisco
[13:11:30] <SnackWhack> She had a master's degree in computer science (which is funny! I helped her through most of her homework!)
[13:12:11] <DannyZB> computers science >< where innocent programmers go to get corrupted
[13:16:30] <kanzie> Is there anything I should consider when using .ajax and trying to prevent leaking memory. I have a problem where .ajax() is called every 2 seconds and it slowly creeps the memory. All it does is in success-clause $.extend() an object with the result. The result is only a few bytes, yet it grows a few k every call.
[13:18:18] <warrenparsons> kanzie: If you're just adding to an object on every iteration, but not changing anything in the display layer, why not just do the ajax call once when it's needed to update display?
[13:19:43] <ThemNuts> is the reason why this doesn't work come because the inputs i'm trying to focus are generated with jQuery? http://jsfiddle.net/DYZky/
[13:20:23] <ThemNuts> What i want to achieve is that when entering a number and the according fields appear, when entering a birthday, it focuses the next field when maxlength is reached
[13:20:35] <ThemNuts> and do this with birthday and month
[13:21:48] <kanzie> warrenparsons: need to load data on interval and preserve the timestamp
[13:22:05] <kanzie> and the reason Im only adding to an object is because Im trying to isolate the memory-leak
[13:22:13] <kanzie> Even without any DOM-manipulation, it still leaks
[13:23:33] <abnormalex> I load my form, which has <textarea class="ckeditor" id="contentBody"> and then I $('#contentBody').val($currentContent[0]['contentBody']);
[13:24:05] <abnormalex> the problem is, sometimes the ckeditor loads before the ajax call, and the textarea val won't affect the ckeditor after it's loaded
[13:24:05] <DannyZB> ThemNuts : I can't find the connection between the markup and the jQuery code
[13:24:46] <ThemNuts> the input visible triggers the first block of jq, showing the amount of input fields they want
[13:25:04] <DannyZB> abnormalex : did you put it inside the .ready clause ?
[13:25:08] <SnackWhack> I didn't realize a F-15 went down a few days ago....
[13:25:22] <abnormalex> DannyZB: putting it in .ready would only extend the delay further
[13:25:23] <ThemNuts> filling in the day (klant_geboortedag) should trigger the 2nd block when it reaches val == maxLength
[13:25:34] <abnormalex> i need to set contentBody.val well before ckeditor loads
[13:26:12] <DannyZB> well so load ckeditor immediately after that command ...
[13:26:21] <DannyZB> that doesn't work ?
[13:26:26] <abnormalex> im not sure how to tell ckeditor when to load
[13:26:37] <abnormalex> im justusing class="ckeditor" on my textarea
[13:27:23] <freeed> Hey allâ€¦ I have an image with css height: 100% ; How can I get the actual height in pixels with jquery? $(elem).height() just returns 0
[13:27:44] <DannyZB> ThemNuts : the text fields have no maxlength attribute
[13:28:05] <ThemNuts> they do, maxlength 2
[13:28:20] <ThemNuts> but only the kind_geboortedag and kind_geboortemaand
[13:28:29] <ThemNuts> since those are the only ones that need it
[13:28:48] <DannyZB> oh ok 1 sec
[13:29:04] <DannyZB> abnormalex : what function loads ckeditor ? where do you use the addon ?
[13:29:10] <DannyZB> you can use delayed JS load
[13:30:10] <DannyZB> or just put it inside the ready command where it should be
[13:30:21] <abnormalex> put what inside the ready command?
[13:32:38] <abnormalex> DannyZB: should I load the ckeditor's js on document.ready? :)
[13:32:48] <DannyZB> yes ..
[13:33:02] <DannyZB> ThemNuts : first of all .. for gods sake don't use the same id for several elements
[13:33:08] <DannyZB> use classes
[13:33:15] <ThemNuts> ok
[13:34:44] <ThemNuts> think i know why it doesn't work though, the inputs are generated and even a keyup() event doesn't trigger
[13:34:54] <SnackWhack> time to go home
[13:34:56] <SnackWhack> l8r yall
[13:35:02] <ThemNuts> but no idea how to trigger events after they are generated
[13:35:39] <DannyZB> ooohhh ThemNuts I know whats your problem !!!!
[13:35:46] <DannyZB> slipped my mind
[13:35:52] <ThemNuts> please tell
[13:36:38] <DannyZB> you want to use http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:36:40] <DannyZB> try that
[13:36:47] <DannyZB> jQuery only binds to existing elements
[13:36:50] <abnormalex> does this look right?
[13:36:52] <DannyZB> I'll have a look again
[13:36:52] <abnormalex> $(document).ready(function() {
[13:36:52] <abnormalex> 			$(this).append('<script src="ckeditor/ckeditor.js"></script>');
[13:37:16] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: ThemNuts: You need to make sure you're using the delegating version of .on() for that to work.
[13:37:42] <DannyZB> abnormalex : yea .. I think thats it try that out
[13:37:48] <abnormalex> its not appending
[13:38:39] <bjensen> hmm can I query on in a selector wether an input is empty? that is wether val() returns true
[13:39:20] <DannyZB> abnormalex : $(document).append('<script src="ckeditor/ckeditor.js"></script>');
[13:39:41] <DannyZB> I have that code lying somewhere .. one sec
[13:40:09] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Will appending to the document outside of the head or body work across all browsers?
[13:40:21] <DannyZB> ohhh yea .. about that .. forgot it
[13:40:40] <DannyZB> I have that exact code in that thing I'm making public for the syntax highlighter loader
[13:40:48] <DannyZB> just need to dig a bit
[13:41:55] <foo> http://jsfiddle.net/QSeSU/ - how would I get the "Click this to expand" to automatically hide/vanish? (eg. display: nnoe)
[13:41:58] <foo> none
[13:42:44] <Blaster> hey how do you only set a click event handler if it doesn't already exist?  I have a function that I'm calling recursively which contains event handlers but the problem is they are firing multiple times after the function runs a few times
[13:43:49] <DannyZB> jQuery('<script/>').attr('src', url).appendTo('head');
[13:43:57] <DannyZB> loads a script dynamically
[13:44:03] <DannyZB> not sure it executes it , check it out
[13:44:14] <DannyZB> warrenparsons *
[13:44:46] <g0rd0n> i have a series of datetimes as strings in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format and would like to format them in different ways as needed, is there a nice plugin for such functionality?
[13:45:37] <DannyZB> g0rd0n : http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-dateFormat
[13:46:19] <g0rd0n> DannyZB: many thanks!
[13:46:21] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Sorry?
[13:46:43] <DannyZB> I said jQuery('<script/>').attr('src', url).appendTo('head'); .. worked a year ago across the board check it out
[13:46:55] <DannyZB> can't promise it also executes but try it out
[13:47:53] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Oh yeah, not surprising. I was more concerned about a script appended directly to the $(document) working reliably, rather than in either the head or body.
[13:48:06] <z0n3d> why does jquery-ui accordion make all the inner content div elements the same height!?
[13:48:27] <warrenparsons> z0n3d: I believe there's a config option to make it not do that.
[13:48:43] <DannyZB> exactly .. I have an insane amount of code for cool stuff like that just lying around
[13:48:56] <DannyZB> just need enough time to separate and document it
[13:48:59] <abnormalex> does any1 use CKEditor?
[13:49:10] <DannyZB> I use it on drupal
[13:49:19] <abnormalex> im experiencing a wierd problem, when I use number or bullets, and hit enter, it takes me to the begninning of line then enters
[13:49:24] <abnormalex> so it moves what i just typed to the next line
[13:49:31] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: That's a lot of my problem. 99% of my best work is buried in one project or another and I never get time to separate it out and make it standalone.
[13:49:36] <z0n3d> warrenparsons, genius ;) haha thanks
[13:50:07] <DannyZB> abnormalex : sounds like encoding mess to me .. rtl-ltr thing
[13:50:12] <suedoh> hey all, I'm having some a hard time getting to the treeview plugin page on jQuery's website.  Anyone know how I can get there?
[13:50:15] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: I should say I never make time. It's really my own fault.
[13:50:18] <DannyZB> warrenparsons : yea
[13:50:25] <abnormalex> DannyZB: i never modified ckeditors code, im nto sure what you mean
[13:50:34] <Hawkee> is there a way to find all the keys in a localStorage database?
[13:50:36] <suedoh> looking to get an ajax treeview going
[13:50:46] <DannyZB> CKEditor does all sorts or wierd stuff like that .. get used to it
[13:50:50] <DannyZB> of*
[13:50:58] <suedoh> i keep coming across this page:  http://dev.jquery.com/browser/trunk/plugins/treeview/   through searches, but it's down it seems
[13:51:01] <abnormalex> mm
[13:51:07] <DannyZB> there is an option to view html there .. see where the problem is
[13:51:09] <abnormalex> should i try  tinymce instead?
[13:51:30] <DannyZB> I don't know if it's any better
[13:51:39] <DannyZB> just find out what your mistake was and never do it again
[13:51:39] <suedoh> Also the plugins website appears to be down
[13:51:51] <warrenparsons> suedoh: Try this https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-treeview
[13:52:15] <suedoh> ah, there we go
[13:52:27] <DannyZB> warrenparsons : I'm the first guy to fit syntaxhighlighter to work directly in jQuery
[13:52:33] <warrenparsons> suedoh: And note that he even recommends someone else's newer plugin on that page.
[13:52:37] <DannyZB> Never wrote a jQuery plugin though
[13:53:32] <Hawkee> got it, nevermind
[13:53:41] <suedoh> let me check
[13:56:10] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: I've written one or two, but never released anything to the public.
[13:56:32] <gehsekky> i would go with the older treeview
[13:56:39] <DannyZB> warrenparsons : I'm cool about my code going to the public .. I think it's a good place for code to be
[13:56:43] <gehsekky> the one he recommends, jstree, is way too bloated
[13:56:52] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Agreed.
[13:57:14] <DannyZB> I think barney stinson said it better than me : New is always better
[13:57:19] <DannyZB> I hate digging in old code lol
[13:57:43] <warrenparsons> DannyZB: Same here. I always want to rewrite it and make it better.
[13:58:12] <DannyZB> we need to find a guy who loves that kinda stuff
[13:58:29] <DannyZB> like a programmer version of a crime scene investigator
[13:59:11] <Blaster> is there a way to stop a recursive function from adding a new click handler each time it loops?
[13:59:47] <DannyZB> var somebool = false ;  loopy { if(!somebool) addClickHandler; somebool=true };
[14:00:56] <antic> @Blaster not to be a naysayer, but why are you attaching a click handler inside a recursive function?
[14:01:44] <DannyZB> better yet .. why use recursion in the first place ?
[14:02:17] <Blaster> I'm loading table HTML upon a page load, and things inside that HTML require click events on them.   And certain other things need to reload that HTML, uponwhich the click events are doubled.
[14:02:33] <Blaster> (ajax)
[14:03:02] <gehsekky> set a data var on it
[14:03:08] <DannyZB> blaster : did you check out using dynamic binding ? ( .on )
[14:03:21] <DannyZB> would save you the trouble of binding every time
[14:03:33] <Blaster> So you can set that outside of the AJAX success function?
[14:04:10] <antic> @DannyZB recursion has great uses: function json2html(arg){ // create ul. for each property, create a list item, if property is an object, call json2html using that property as obj arg }
[14:05:12] <DannyZB> antic : thats the only use of recursion ( trees ) , and even then most of the time it can be replaced with loops
[14:05:39] <DannyZB> recursion may be a cool trick for programming schools but in production environments it performs awfully slow
[14:05:42] <Blaster> function loadTable() {  $.get(...,function() { // load html}  $('.addRow').click(function() { loadTable() }) }
[14:05:45] <gehsekky> DannyZB: but that's not "elegant" in the words of my college professor
[14:06:12] <DannyZB> thats why he's a professor instead of a working professional (:
[14:06:19] <gehsekky> recursion typically runs very fast
[14:06:27] <gehsekky> it's just slow because of performance issues
[14:06:36] <antic> loops don't allow arbitrary depth, recursion does
[14:06:40] <gehsekky> constantly adding to the program stack
[14:06:44] <ThemNuts> DannyZB: Thanks, figured it out how to get some action from the input fields; Now only to do the maxlength comparison and trigger the focus
[14:06:46] <ThemNuts> http://jsfiddle.net/DYZky/6/
[14:06:53] <DannyZB> you can fake arbitrary depth many times
[14:07:00] <DannyZB> ThemNuts: cool , good luck
[14:07:02] <warrenparsons> In JS recursion is usually slower than looping. It's also quicker for most other developers to understand when reading your code. Other than that, do whatever makes you happy.
[14:07:17] <warrenparsons> Rather, looping is quicker to understand.
[14:07:24] <DannyZB> gesekky : it's good that you're aware of that .. many computer science majors use it in all the wrong places
[14:07:49] <gehsekky> apart from trees, i haven't used it in years tbh :P
[14:08:05] <gehsekky> but give me some tree-type structure, and i'll recurse the hell out of it
[14:08:22] <DannyZB> good good .. don't let schooling interfere with your education
[14:09:09] <gehsekky> on-the-job education = stackoverflow + irc
[14:09:12] <gehsekky> amirite?
[14:09:33] <DannyZB> tru dat true dat
[14:09:47] <antic> @Blaster you could also use $.delegate to live bind outside of your table generation code
[14:09:59] <ThemNuts> whoop di fucking doo :)
[14:10:01] <ThemNuts> got it
[14:10:03] <gehsekky> delegate is also done through .on now
[14:10:04] <ThemNuts> thanks DannyZB
[14:10:16] <gehsekky> if we're talkin jq1.7+
[14:10:30] <antic> ah, yes @gehsekky :) thanks for the correction :)
[14:11:42] <DannyZB> Programming is finally mainstream .. I wonder when we would be able to call ourselves software engineers to get laid hehe
[14:11:58] <gehsekky> programming isn't really software engineering though
[14:12:00] <albertosh> hello all! Does anyone knows how to do a DELETE request using jquery? I'm getting the Allow-Control-Access-Origin error
[14:12:03] <DannyZB> Someone needs to do a sillicon valley version of Californication
[14:12:13] <blindMoe> DannyZB: you mean the same show but w/ no sex?
[14:12:16] <gehsekky> albertosh: it's a typical $.ajax call with "delete" for type
[14:12:19] <DannyZB> lol
[14:12:25] <DannyZB> same show .. with sex in the office
[14:12:36] <DannyZB> and replace Karen with the secretary
[14:12:37] <blindMoe> hehe you wouldn't want to watch those people have sex though
[14:12:46] <PilotBob> why would removeAttr("xsi:schemaLocation") not work???

[14:13:23] <DannyZB> I don't want to -watch- anyone have sex
[14:13:31] <blindMoe> hehe good point
[14:13:49] <DannyZB> that karen gal .. she's a bitch but god is she hot
[14:14:14] <gehsekky> i think they're doing a silicon valley reality show
[14:14:25] <gehsekky> involving mark zuckerberg's sister
[14:14:34] <DannyZB> who cares about his sister ?
[14:14:37] <gehsekky> haha
[14:14:55] <gehsekky> i just want to see them show hot silicon valley programmer babes
[14:15:16] <blindMoe> gehsekky: do they exist?  I thought that was like big foot or a unicorn
[14:15:45] <DannyZB> I've seen some hot programmer babes
[14:15:52] <DannyZB> but none of them have anything to do with sillicon valley lol
[14:15:57] <gehsekky> hehe
[14:16:14] <PilotBob> anybody?
[14:16:37] <DannyZB> PilotBob : isn't ":" a reserved character ?
[14:16:49] <gehsekky> i believe it is
[14:17:00] <PilotBob> DannyZB: I don't know, I tried to escape it with a backslash and that didn't work either.
[14:17:12] <PilotBob> DannyZB: this is an xmldocument
[14:17:42] <DannyZB> I treat XML like leprosy .. never mess with it .. StackOverflow it to death (:
[14:18:11] <DannyZB> You know something .. I'm not sure a programmer chick is good to have ..
[14:18:21] <PilotBob> DannyZB: ha... I'm about to just use regex on the xml string before I parse it into a dom document.
[14:18:51] <DannyZB> What if she mentions C++ in bed ? thats like .. the anti-viagra
[14:19:47] <DannyZB> PilotBob : we need the code .. it would help the guys here
[14:19:57] <z0n3d> ive never seen a programmer babe. are you sure that wasn't just ascii art?
[14:20:09] <gehsekky> one of my ex's used to be a QA developer
[14:20:17] <DannyZB> LOL
[14:20:17] <gehsekky> used to turn me on when she would talk sql
[14:20:24] <DannyZB> "quality assure THIS
[14:20:26] <gehsekky> TALK DIRTY TO ME
[14:20:44] <z0n3d> INSERT INTO......
[14:20:50] <gehsekky> haha
[14:21:36] <DannyZB> And then we wonder why chicks don't go with programmers XDD
[14:21:47] <DannyZB> When women ask me I tell them I'm a drug dealer
[14:22:13] <ThemNuts> when putting it in my code it gives me the error .on is not a function,,,, wtf?
[14:22:21] <gehsekky> ThemNuts: what version of jquery?
[14:22:25] <z0n3d> latest version?
[14:22:39] <DannyZB> if it's an outdated version then you need to use .live ()
[14:22:46] <gehsekky> .on was only added in 1.7
[14:22:56] <z0n3d> if it's an outdated version....you need to upgrade :P
[14:22:56] <ThemNuts> 1.6.2
[14:22:58] <ThemNuts> righ
[14:23:13] <gehsekky> either upgrade, or revert to live/bind/delegate
[14:23:28] <z0n3d> on is much better than delegate
[14:23:28] <DannyZB> I say revert .. live looks much cooler in code than .on
[14:23:43] <gehsekky> i like .on :D
[14:23:52] <gehsekky> $(document) chaining
[14:24:02] <DannyZB> you guys are chaining freaks
[14:24:10] <gehsekky> MUST CHAIN ALL THE THINGS
[14:24:44] <PilotBob> DannyZB: ok... I was just wondering if there was somerthing obvious, becaause it works for xmlns::xsi ... so I'm not sure when it doesn't work for the other.
[14:24:45] <DannyZB> Thats what you did to the QA chick
[14:24:46] <DannyZB> BURNED
[14:24:58] <infinity2> can anyone tell me why if i have <td><span>&nbsp;</span></td> when i bind click() to the td if i click on the span my click wont fire?
[14:30:26] <Jon47> infinity2: that oughta work, my initial thought would be that the whitespace isn't bubble up events properly but I think it ought to.. can you write up a fiddle that demonstrates the error?
[14:33:06] <infinity2> i figured out because it was bound to the TD.click and i was requiring propertys bound to it
[14:33:18] <infinity2> and $(this) was referencing the span not the td
[14:33:20] <infinity2> thanks anyway
[14:33:33] <RealityBall> is there anything wrong with this code?
[14:33:34] <RealityBall> http://pastebin.com/q3f3jWdG
[14:35:07] <westg> use single quotes
[14:35:12] <westg> other than that looks ok
[14:35:16] <RealityBall> okay
[14:35:53] <RealityBall> thx
[14:36:23] <RealityBall> still does nothing I must be implementing it wrong
[14:36:45] <RealityBall> *sigh*
[14:36:48] <RealityBall> I'll come back to it
[14:38:00] <DannyZB> RealityBall : is "#one" loaded dynamically ?
[14:38:26] <RealityBall> DannyZB: what do you mean loaded dynamically?
[14:38:37] <DannyZB> do you create it after that call ?
[14:39:02] <RealityBall> its in the html it doesn't really change but I put the script in the head
[14:39:14] <DannyZB> ithen that code is correct
[14:39:19] <DannyZB> the problem is elsewhere
[14:40:01] <RealityBall> DannyZB, lemme copy paste the html
[14:40:21] <DannyZB> jsfiddle.net !
[14:40:27] <DannyZB> not pastebin
[14:40:42] <RealityBall> ummm
[14:40:43] <RealityBall> oh okay
[14:40:51] <RealityBall> haha just pasted it in pastebin
[14:40:53] <RealityBall> then came here
[14:40:59] <RealityBall> okay lemme see this jsfiddle
[14:43:33] <westg> works here
[14:45:24] <westg> http://pastebin.com/Fe3PrhLS
[14:45:37] <westg> I changed ther css because I don't have the image
[14:46:18] <RealityBall> okay I am having trouble with jsfiddle
[14:46:26] <RealityBall> how do I even upload the images
[14:46:32] <RealityBall> to make it work or whatever
[14:46:35] <DannyZB> lol you'll learn to love it in the future
[14:46:39] <DannyZB> pastebin it for now
[14:46:53] <RealityBall> http://pastebin.com/Vzr5uvAr
[14:47:38] <RealityBall> see the script is its own file
[14:47:39] <DannyZB> you're trying to set the background of a link ?
[14:47:40] <RealityBall> showit.js
[14:47:50] <RealityBall> no I want to set the background of a div
[14:47:55] <RealityBall> the div is showtime
[14:48:00] <RealityBall> has the id showtime
[14:48:07] <RealityBall> i want to change it on click
[14:48:11] <RealityBall> kind of like a slideshow
[14:48:29] <RealityBall> so when ppl click the number one 1 the image changes
[14:48:34] <RealityBall> and so on
[14:49:23] <DannyZB> what do you get in the debug console when you click ? any errors ?
[14:49:53] <RealityBall> absolutely
[14:49:54] <RealityBall> none
[14:50:04] <DannyZB> are you sure jQuery is loaded correctly ?
[14:50:09] <RealityBall> I think it is
[14:50:13] <DannyZB> try $("div"); in the console
[14:51:06] <RealityBall> it returned
[14:51:08] <RealityBall> this
[14:51:16] <RealityBall> [14:50:48.708] ({length:6, prevObject:{0:#1=({}), context:#1#, length:1}, context:#1#, selector:"div", 0:({}), 1:({}), 2:({}), 3:({}), 4:({}), 5:({})})
[14:51:33] <RealityBall> that means its loaded correctly?
[14:51:48] <RealityBall> maybe its something silly like a filename
[14:51:48] <DannyZB> yes
[14:51:57] <DannyZB> ok second test
[14:52:21] <RealityBall> I am looking forward to this second test
[14:52:23] <DannyZB> try $("#showtime").css("background-color", "black"); in the console see what happens
[14:53:03] <RealityBall> nothing changed on the page
[14:53:06] <RealityBall> but it showed this
[14:53:16] <RealityBall> [14:52:45.981] ({length:1, 0:({}), context:({}), selector:"#showtime"})
[14:53:36] <RealityBall> I must be selecting the elements wrong then?
[14:54:06] <RealityBall> would it help to say $("div#showtime") instead?
[14:55:12] <DannyZB> you're selecting them right
[14:55:14] <DannyZB> one sec
[14:55:35] <RealityBall> yeah it didn't make a difference
[14:59:46] <RealityBall> DannyZB: actually I might not have noticed the change to black because of the background image?
[14:59:52] <RealityBall> maybe it did work?
[15:00:13] <DannyZB> just see if the CSS change works
[15:00:18] <DannyZB> add an attribute thats visible
[15:00:27] <DannyZB> if it works for one attribute it would work for this one
[15:00:38] <RealityBall> ok
[15:01:26] <DannyZB> it works for me
[15:01:40] <DannyZB> it gives the links a black background color
[15:01:47] <DannyZB> maybe you have an overriding style ?
[15:02:07] <DannyZB> try $("#showtime").css("background-color", "black !Important");
[15:02:19] <foo> anyone ever used backstrech? it's not working on iPad, this is crazy.
[15:02:30] <RealityBall> ok and yeah I tried changing another element and it works okay I will try ur code
[15:02:54] <DannyZB> the !important thing tells it to override all other styles before or after it
[15:03:15] <RealityBall> [15:02:57.556] Expected end of value but found '!'.  Error in parsing value for 'background-color'.  Declaration dropped. @ file:///home/royalty/Desktop/website/Idea%20Group/ideagroup.html
[15:04:21] <DannyZB> ... bummer
[15:04:28] <DannyZB> anyway you probably have an overriding style
[15:04:33] <DannyZB> it works with your exact code for me
[15:04:43] <RealityBall> DannyZB: sounds like its css styling haha yeah thanks
[15:04:57] <DannyZB> if you use chrome
[15:05:06] <DannyZB> just check the css for the element should solve your problem
[15:05:12] <DannyZB> NP
[15:05:37] <RealityBall> DannyZB: alright cool I will go work out then get back to it thanks again
[15:17:02] <bsm_nate1> jQuery mobile q, not sure how best to explain:
[15:17:03] <bsm_nate1> My app skeleton (ASCII art) looks like this -> https://gist.github.com/d6fe057c67a23efd439e
[15:17:03] <bsm_nate1> When I go from list&filter=active, back to home, to list#filter=dead the url bar shows list&filter=active but jQuery mobile knows its on list&filter=dead.
[15:38:49] <evilgeenius> I'm performing a simple ajax action from my page,  moveBoxToPosition,  that calls my server backend and updates something.  There is a chance that the user might not have the access rights to do the action.  Whats the best way to get an error message onto the screen?  What's best practice?
[15:41:01] <chovy> evilgeenius: can you trigger an error handler when the ajax call fails?
[15:41:17] <raj> what's the reason I need input:checked without a space, but select :selected with a space?
[15:41:23] <raj> oh, because it's in the option
[15:41:24] <raj> nm
[15:41:45] <evilgeenius> evilgeenius: yeah, that's what I thinking of doing.  But should I return JSON in the error response with the message in?
[15:43:23] <raj> talking to yourself?
[15:43:37] <shoky> rajy
[15:44:43] <evilgeenius> evilgeenius: good plan
[15:45:11] <raj> hey there shoky
[15:49:11] <shoky> sup
[15:56:34] <raj> just trucking along with the website :)
[15:56:45] <raj> how was your weekend?
[16:00:46] <shoky> nice, was at a friend's up north, hiked a bit
[16:04:40] <skcin7> Quick question... not entirely jQuery related but I was hoping somebody here could help. In the w3.org html5 documentation, I'm reading up on custom data attributes, and one of the requirements for it to be valid is "contains no characters in the range U+0041 to U+005A". How can I know what character set U+0041 to U+005A are from and is there anywhere to get a full list of the characters of a given character set?
[16:05:36] <nicovalencia> skcin7 - http://www.utf8-chartable.de/
[16:06:30] <nicovalencia> (No capitals.)
[16:06:51] <skcin7> nicovalencia - Very awesome, thanks. So if it starts with U, then it's from UTF-8 I guess?
[16:07:56] <snover> no
[16:08:24] <snover> utf-8 is a character encoding for unicode. U means Unicode.
[16:10:24] <nicovalencia> touche - you can look them up the same way
[16:10:29] <someprimetime> question
[16:10:30] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/rAQtn/
[16:10:52] <someprimetime> if you hover on each of those boxes, and click, it should write to the console log
[16:10:58] <nicovalencia> (I belive they will be the same though.)
[16:10:59] <someprimetime> if you hover over like 4 of them the events all get built up
[16:11:02] <skcin7> Ah ok. I assumed the "U" was for UTF-8. I have a lot of reading to do before I fully understand character sets. snover - thanks for the clarification.
[16:11:03] <someprimetime> and it'll trigger that write 4 times
[16:11:14] <someprimetime> how can i control it to just write once?
[16:11:21] <someprimetime> should i move the click event outside of the hover?
[16:11:43] <catcher> I'm using slidUp to obscure a few divs in a row. I want it to reset on the last one, how do I get the first one to show again?
[16:11:47] <catcher> Do I need to reposition it?
[16:12:19] <nicovalencia> skcin7 - They are still the same - A-Z still stands.
[16:12:25] <nicovalencia> Just use lowercase.
[16:12:58] <someprimetime> yeah
[16:12:59] <someprimetime> that worked
[16:13:01] <someprimetime> thanks someprimetime
[16:14:28] <skcin7> nicovalencia - It says in parenthesis on the documentation page where I saw them that they're uppercase characters haha. I was curious what the U+HEXCODE denotation meant in case I ever come across it again. Now I know that it's Unicode. :)
[16:15:37] <skcin7> I tried googling but "U+0041" is a pretty generic string that could mean anything, so that search didn't provide relevant results.
[16:23:13] <shoky> someprimetime yes you should move it outside of the hover
[16:23:22] <someprimetime> thx shoky that took care of it
[16:30:29] <s0u][ight> hello, http://jsfiddle.net/bDn87/ i have a small "dock" i want icons to grow when hovering, this works, but it breaks when hovering
[16:41:05] <shoky> s0u][ight, works a bit better if you float the images: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bDn87/1/
[16:42:01] <s0u][ight> yeah, but what causes the break?
[16:42:12] <shoky> er disregard the 'animating' boolean i added
[16:42:23] <westg> http://jsfiddle.net/bDn87/2/
[16:43:11] <Blaster> hey guys, I have a lightBoxWrapper and a lightBox, and I want to close them both when the lightBoxWrapper is clicked (the faded overlay).  I Set $('.lightBoxWrapper').click(function(e) { $(this).hide });  but it's also closing everything when inside the lightbox is clicked.  What's a good workaround?
[16:44:11] <Blaster> nvm, I'm just not going to nest the lightBox inside the lightBoxWrapper
[16:44:34] <westg> yeah nesting is going to cause the behavior you rdescribed to inevitably happen
[16:44:40] <westg> better to not nest it
[16:46:30] <shoky> s0u][ight there's no break when there's enough width: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/bDn87/3/
[16:47:16] <s0u][ight> nice, thanks
[16:47:29] * youngin is now playing: http://youngblood.probsd.net/youngin-4coldhead.mp3
[16:48:22] <westg> just curious but why would you want the dock itself to jump around?
[16:52:21] <s0u][ight> westg, what do you mean by jump around?
[16:52:42] <coldhead> like young people at a dance party
[16:53:07] * s0u][ight had a modest smile on his face
[16:53:52] <westg> lol
[16:54:03] <s0u][ight> it was testing, i want to mimic the mac dock (hiding)
[16:55:26] <s0u][ight> i'd like it to float at he center, in stead of left
[16:56:01] <oojacoboo> s0u][ight: use margin: 0 auto;
[16:56:57] <s0u][ight> oojacoboo, nope, causes all img to go to the left
[16:58:12] <oojacoboo> maybe I'm missing the issue here
[17:04:08] <mikkelb> youngin: this is ur crew right? http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/Rapstjernene-flipper-ut-i-ny-video-2679085.html
[17:11:44] <raj> is this legal? $("#myform input[value='""']") ?
[17:12:03] <shoky> doesnt seem to be
[17:12:08] <shoky> not legal javascript, that is
[17:12:12] <raj> yeah
[17:12:14] <raj> didn't think so
[17:12:32] <raj> so is there a 3rd quoting mechanism?
[17:12:38] <shoky> there's escaping
[17:12:42] <shoky> \"
[17:12:45] <raj> I wanna select the element with value=''
[17:12:59] <shoky> two single quotes?
[17:13:09] <raj> yeah
[17:13:15] <raj> but using "" would still select it
[17:13:26] <raj> afaik
[17:13:27] <shoky> mm not sure what you mean
[17:14:03] <raj> I wanna select the input element that has value=''
[17:14:23] <raj> but I think if I select the input element with value="", it'll still be selected afaik
[17:14:28] <shoky> $("#myform input[value='\'\'']")
[17:14:55] <raj> yuck
[17:15:10] <raj> is this my only choice?
[17:15:27] <raj> .filter maybe?
[17:15:31] <shoky> it's your choice to select elements with value=''  :)
[17:15:40] <shoky> or not to
[17:16:37] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1299424/selecting-empty-text-input-using-jquery
[17:17:20] <shoky> oh you wanted empty values?
[17:17:22] <raj> oh nice, "" would just work
[17:17:41] <raj> I want the input element that has a value of ''
[17:17:52] <coldhead> ?eval "" === ''
[17:17:55] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[17:18:00] <coldhead> same thing, bucko
[17:18:07] <shoky> is '' an empty string
[17:18:17] <shoky> or is it a string containing two single quotes
[17:18:49] <coldhead> it's an emptry string
[17:18:52] <Blaster> Hey guys, how do you prevent IE from caching pages when doing Ajax calls?
[17:19:00] <shoky> in javascript, yes
[17:19:00] <coldhead> ?eval "''" === ""
[17:19:01] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[17:19:05] <shoky> but i'm referring to rajspeak
[17:19:31] <coldhead> raj: if you're trying to distinguish between "" and '' ur doing it very wrong
[17:20:02] <shoky> escaping is beautiful :(
[17:20:05] <Blaster> IE has a sick love of caching
[17:20:12] <Blaster> whatever I request with Ajax!
[17:20:21] <shoky> yay IE
[17:20:34] <Blaster> IE is the cancer of the internet!
[17:20:37] <coldhead> Blaster: just add a random param to the GET string
[17:20:42] <raj> coldhead, i'm not trying to distinguish
[17:20:54] <coldhead> Blaster: jquery will do this for you in some cases
[17:21:03] <raj> i was saying i don't think it matters if I gave the element value='' or value="" in the html, for when I select it with jquery
[17:21:27] <coldhead> Blaster: check out the cache option here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:21:50] <coldhead> raj: ur right, it doesn't matter, all empty strings are equivalent
[17:21:59] <coldhead> the quote marks are a matter for yourself
[17:22:05] <coldhead> honey badger doesn't give a shit
[17:22:14] <raj> honey badger?
[17:22:27] <coldhead> sorry, i have a cold
[17:22:39] <killallz> yo
[17:23:03] <coldhead> hello web user
[17:23:20] <killallz> does any one know where i can find the tutorial of the code thats on the front page of http://jquery.com/

[17:24:56] <killallz> oh and what up shoky!
[17:26:09] <killallz> anyone?
[17:26:29] <Blaster> killallz:  Use firebug or something and see the html/css
[17:27:13] <killallz> some one gave me the link  for it a couple days a go but i lost it :(
[17:27:25] <killallz> for the code btw not firebug
[17:27:29] <coldhead> http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/scripts/custom.js
[17:27:55] <killallz> its called show or something
[17:39:55] <wpsmith> Would anyone know how to count the number of checked boxes within a <li>?
[17:40:55] <cnnr> wpsmith: does $("li input:checked").length() work for you?
[17:41:33] <wpsmith> no because there are other li's but that gives me an idea
[17:41:44] <cnnr> cool
[18:26:01] <killallz> hey guys

[18:26:57] <cnnr> @killallz make a jsfiddle, please - http://jsfiddle.net/
[18:27:20] <killallz> how do you use it
[18:27:39] <killallz> dw  figured it out ill post link
[18:29:57] <killallz> http://jsfiddle.net/GQyMr/
[18:30:32] <killallz> can anyone help
[18:30:49] <killallz> i copied it exactly as it is except i changed the links
[18:31:23] <killallz> like the whole page breaks
[18:31:58] <killallz> i also have shadowbox on the same page
[18:33:10] <alexr2> killallz, come on... put a little effort into the jsfiddle... it's made to make things functional.  put the html in the top left, and the javascript in the bottom left...
[18:33:29] <alexr2> include jquery on the left, not inline in the javascript
[18:33:29] <killallz> sorry ill fix it
[18:34:40] <alexr2> outside of that... you're expecting a click event on a hidden element... there's nothing on the page to click.
[18:37:14] <killallz> no it works on other pages but only on the page i want it doesnt work
[18:37:53] <alexr2> then it's not the javascript, it' something else
[18:37:59] <alexr2> are you including jquery more than once?
[18:38:04] <alexr2> what does your console say?
[18:38:24] <killallz> yea im using shadowbox on the same page
[18:39:30] <killallz> it uses jquery
[18:39:50] <killallz> aswell
[18:40:37] <killallz> is anyone there?
[18:41:37] <alexr2> killallz, what is in your console
[18:41:41] <alexr2> what browser are you using?
[18:41:45] <killallz> what do you mean
[18:41:47] <killallz> chrome
[18:41:57] <alexr2> right click on the page, click inspect element, then console
[18:43:09] <killallz> lightbox_call.js:2Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'lightBox' (anonymous function)lightbox_call.js:2 f.Callbacks.njquery.min.js:2 f.Callbacks.o.fireWithjquery.min.js:2 e.extend.readyjquery.min.js:2 c.addEventListener.Bjquery.min.js:2
[18:43:34] <killallz> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'lightBox'
[18:43:34] <alexr2> do you understand any of that?
[18:43:57] <killallz> iam i  missing any of it
[18:43:57] <killallz> ?
[18:44:03] <alexr2> no
[18:44:28] <alexr2> you're probably doing something like $('#lboxselector').lightBox()
[18:44:33] <alexr2> or something of that sort, correct?
[18:46:21] <killallz> im not using light box
[18:46:45] <alexr2> you are somewhere in your code... otherwise you wouldn't get that error.
[18:47:42] <alexr2> you've included a file lightbox_call.js somewhere in your code
[18:47:55] <alexr2> and on line 2 of that file, it's trying to use that call
[18:48:15] <alexr2> but it doesn't have a lightbox method to use, so the most likely thing is that you aren't including that javascript yet
[18:48:31] <killallz> hmm like what
[18:48:49] <alexr2> ? what do you mean?
[18:48:52] <bot-t> alexr2, #11114 (jQuery doesn't take into account CSS scale transform when ... - Opened 3 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11114
[18:49:01] <alexr2> whoops
[18:50:42] <killallz> is it because i have 2 jquery elementds on the same page
[18:50:52] <alexr2> don't know what you mean
[18:51:01] <killallz> im using shadow box
[18:51:12] <killallz> and http://api.jquery.com/show/
[18:52:20] <killallz> http://www.shadowbox-js.com/
[18:53:14] <alexr2> http://www.shadowbox-js.com/ not available
[18:53:31] <killallz> its working for me
[18:54:15] <samhuntley> not working here
[18:54:33] <alexr2> http://www.downforeveryone.com/http://www.shadowbox-js.com/
[18:55:20] <killallz> its working for me
[18:55:23] <killallz> ...
[18:55:36] <Lobster> does anyone know if jquery will animate the coordinates of the rect defining a clip property?
[18:55:43] <alexr2> you probably have a cached copy of it killallz
[18:55:51] <killallz> oh
[18:55:56] <coldhead> ?down www.shadowbox-js.com
[18:55:59] <bot-t> coldhead, It's not just you! - http://www.shadowbox-js.com looks down from here.
[18:56:22] <coldhead> i doubt it, Lobster
[18:56:53] <alexr2> huh, this bot-t surprises me every day
[18:56:58] <killallz> does it have to do with there being two jquery elements on the same page?
[18:57:21] <alexr2> killallz, i told you earlier i didn't know what you meant by 2 jquery elements... describe what you're saying better please
[18:57:26] <Lobster> coldhead: know of any library that might do that?
[18:57:39] <coldhead> Lobster: there's probably a jQuery plugin that does it
[18:57:45] <coldhead> search for jquery css3 plugins
[18:57:52] <Lobster> clip is css2 ;)
[18:58:11] <coldhead> but css3 does it better, probably
[18:58:13] <killallz> does it have anything to do with the fact i have  shadowbocx and .show() from jquery.com on the same page?
[18:59:00] <alexr2> only jquery can be from jquery
[18:59:06] <coldhead> http://www.overset.com/2008/08/07/jquery-css-clip-animation-plugin/
[18:59:11] <coldhead> and so on
[18:59:39] <alexr2> do you not have a <script src="shadowbox.js"></script> somewhere?
[18:59:50] <alexr2> and no, you can have as much jquery on a single page as you'd like
[19:01:03] <killallz> yes  i do have it \
[19:01:10] <jaapbadlands> how would I select all anchor tags on the page which link to pdf documents?
[19:01:22] <alexr2> killallz, can you post more of your code that could possibly be associated with the problem?
[19:03:59] <killallz> ok alexr2 i just deleted the light box plugin i had installed and forgot about but it still isnt working
[19:05:05] <killallz> and there is nothing on console
[19:05:23] <killallz> and no i cant because there are links to  on the pagethe site
[19:05:45] <alexr2> if there's nothing in console, then things are working, you just don't have the code doing what you want it to do
[19:05:48] <alexr2> what are you trying to get done
[19:07:15] <killallz> im trting to have some sort of page navigation thiing where if you click on the page number a box opens up with the other page numbers
[19:08:58] <killallz> can i give the element an id by anychance
[19:09:46] <alexr2> yes
[19:09:53] <killallz> ok cool
[19:09:59] <alexr2> i would recommend it
[19:10:39] <killallz> heres the jsfiddle
[19:10:40] <killallz> http://jsfiddle.net/Q46ts/
[19:11:19] <killallz> ca you give "show it" an id
[19:11:38] <killallz> and then put multiple show it
[19:11:40] <alexr2> http://jsfiddle.net/Q46ts/1/
[19:11:54] <killallz> sorry
[19:11:59] <killallz> not show it
[19:12:04] <killallz> hello world 2
[19:12:41] <alexr2> yes
[19:12:52] <killallz> ok cool
[19:12:52] <youngin> yes!
[19:12:57] <killallz> how do you you do it
[19:12:59] <shoky> yesssssssssssssssss
[19:13:02] <alexr2> ? selectors

[19:13:16] <alexr2> you should read through that
[19:13:44] <killallz> is anyone bothered to do it for me
[19:13:44] <killallz> :P
[19:13:53] <alexr2> that's nto what we're here for :-)
[19:13:53] <killallz> kinda strapped for time
[19:13:57] <killallz> </3
[19:14:11] * youngin is now playing: http://youngblood.probsd.net/youngin-4coldhead2.mp3
[19:14:15] <youngin> slight cleanup

[19:14:36] <alexr2> read that one

[19:18:42] <jcbk1> hey people. does anyone know of a simple but useful plugin to make a website's content load dynamically? backbone.js seems a bit too overwhelming for a simple portfolio website.
[19:18:53] <killallz> ok im still not getting it
[19:19:00] <killallz> how do i give it s class
[19:19:06] <killallz> give it a class
[19:19:11] <killallz> like i want to say
[19:19:16] <killallz> i want to
[19:19:18] <alexr2> <div class="thisistheclass"></div>
[19:19:32] <alexr2> selector for that class $('.thisistheclass')
[19:19:55] <alexr2> dude, if you're on a time crunch and you don't know how to add a class to an element, i'm gonna just say that you're screwed
[19:20:35] <NivenHuH> http://jsfiddle.net/uqxzz/1/  i have three issues i'm trying to work out re: css3 animations / js.. sorry in advance for only using -webkit- prefixes.. i'm being lazy right now while i dev it
[19:20:38] <killallz> nah i got most of the site
[19:21:36] <alexr2> NivenHuH, your questions aren't specific enough... how can you set what css property from javascript?
[19:21:46] <NivenHuH> alexr2 i have the code commented in the css
[19:21:54] <alexr2> $(selector).css("height","100px")
[19:22:19] <NivenHuH> alexr2 sorry i was expecting the ol's to be numbered..  i have comments /* problem1, problem2, etc.. *
[19:23:01] <shoky> jcbk1 take a look at knockoutjs
[19:23:10] <shoky> i'm loving it
[19:23:20] <NivenHuH> alexr2 so for example, i'm wanting to set css on  the selector ".animate li.moveDown ~ *"
[19:24:05] <alexr2> ? css
[19:24:06] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[19:24:30] <NivenHuH> alexr2 right, but that doesn't work for pseudo selectors
[19:24:39] <NivenHuH> like ~ *
[19:24:51] <shoky> what's ~?
[19:25:01] <alexr2> yeah i've never even seen that
[19:25:04] <NivenHuH> it means siblings following the selected element
[19:25:27] <alexr2> why not just use jquery siblings?
[19:25:28] <shoky> hm
[19:25:31] <NivenHuH> .moveDown ~ *  in css = everything following the .moveDown class
[19:26:01] <NivenHuH> alexr2 if you have 500 elements in a list, it's much more costly to modify css on 500 elements than it is to change one line of css
[19:26:09] <NivenHuH> and have the browser compute it
[19:26:56] <alexr2> you know when you change css, it's only changing it for a specific element, correct? not for the page css file
[19:27:02] <raj> I was gonna make an example to ask a question, but I'm not sure what's wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/J7zW8/
[19:27:21] <alexr2> like if you have an element with class a
[19:27:25] <shoky> raj that looks pretty empty
[19:27:32] <alexr2> change css using something like $('.a').css("change...
[19:27:32] <raj> alexr2, yes
[19:27:43] <raj> shoky, i know, yet I get an error
[19:27:48] <alexr2> raj, that wasn't for you
[19:27:53] <raj> I've included 3 libraries (+jquery)
[19:27:55] <alexr2> if you add another element with class a, it won't be affected by your change
[19:27:55] <NivenHuH> i understand that.. my question is..   is there is a way to set css for a style dictated by a css3 pseudo class
[19:28:24] <alexr2> not to my knowledge
[19:28:39] <shoky> raj i think you need jquery ui
[19:28:51] <alexr2> you're trying to set a css property the same way a css file would work... i don't think that's possible
[19:29:16] <NivenHuH> ah ok..
[19:29:30] <raj> shoky, yep, you're right
[19:29:37] <abnormalex> how can i window. reload same page?
[19:29:38] <alexr2> unfortunately, you actually do have to go and add css to each element that would be affected
[19:30:31] <raj> ok, trying to make a more interesting question... :)
[19:30:34] <shoky> ;)
[19:30:44] <shoky> abnormalex, wat
[19:30:55] <abnormalex> shoky: i need to refresh page
[19:30:59] <abnormalex> with js or jquery
[19:31:21] <shoky> location.reload()
[19:31:22] <alexr2> if you're worried about the css jquery method taking a long time, you can set a prespecified class in your css
[19:31:24] <abnormalex> thanks
[19:31:28] <alexr2> and add the class to all the appropriate elements
[19:31:39] <alexr2> but i doubt that's any more efficient
[19:31:48] <alexr2> might look better though
[19:32:22] <NivenHuH> alexr2 right.. that's good advice.. thanks
[19:32:30] <alexr2> no problem
[19:33:00] <NivenHuH> the prev sibling question is somewhat moot if i'm going to do thatâ€¦  but any feedback on the use of timers?
[19:33:20] <alexr2> do callbacks on your animations
[19:33:37] <alexr2> well... since you're doing it through css3
[19:33:40] <alexr2> i guess you can't do that
[19:33:51] <NivenHuH> right, i think only safari has support for animation callbacks
[19:33:53] <alexr2> if you want to do it through jquery .animate, you can have a callback once the animation finishes
[19:34:29] <NivenHuH> what i would like is for there to be some sort of way to structure it so that it's  "run this code in one run loop, then run this code in the next run loop, etc.."
[19:34:58] <alexr2> ie, callback :-P
[19:35:10] <NivenHuH> if you apply all of the stuff in one go (especially when it  comes to changing the dom), the animations either don't fire or do something crazy
[19:35:29] <alexr2> best bet is to look for a jquery plugin for it
[19:35:36] <alexr2> i never liked animation for the same reason you're saying
[19:36:21] <NivenHuH> ok cool. thanks for the advice
[19:39:05] <alexr2> you're welcome, sorry i couldn't give you better news
[19:44:35] <multi_io> is there a generic API for setting the values in a form? Something like formelement.set(name, values), which would work with all types of form input elements, not just text boxes?
[19:44:54] <multi_io> i.e. an API for filling a form
[19:49:46] <sodapop> how can i select all first level li from ul

[19:56:55] <hopeless> how do you isolate a jquery code
[19:57:58] <hopeless> ? help
[19:57:58] <bot-t> Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[19:58:17] <alexr2> Your question doesn't make any sense :-P
[19:59:02] <hopeless> ok i have a code  but when i run it  its affecting everything else on the page
[19:59:32] <alexr2> Use http://jsfiddle.net to try to replicate it so that we can look at what you're having issues with
[20:00:17] <hopeless> is there  anyway  where you dont need to see the code
[20:00:18] <hopeless> ?
[20:00:58] <alexr2> Your issue has to do with code.  It sounds like you don't know too much about jquery or javascript in general.  So yes, I need to see code
[20:02:25] <killallz> hey guys
[20:02:31] <killallz> still cant get my code to work
[20:02:34] <hopeless> is there any code that says stay in this box
[20:03:23] <coldhead> overflow: hidden ?
[20:03:25] <alexr2> hopeless, there should be a save button up top
[20:03:27] <hopeless> and everything inside is isolated from everything else on the page
[20:03:41] <alexr2> an iframe i guess?
[20:03:45] <alexr2> you're being a bit cryptic
[20:03:57] <hopeless> what do you mean cryptic
[20:04:23] <alexr2> as in it's hard to understand what your overall goal is
[20:05:01] <killallz> i think hopless wants it like this
[20:05:18] <killallz> |---------------------------------------
[20:05:18] <killallz> |
[20:05:18] <killallz> \
[20:05:20] <killallz> \
[20:05:28] <killallz> |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
[20:06:11] <alexr2> hopeless, you should read up on html before you go into jquery.... what you want isn't really a jquery question.  if anything, it's a javascript issue
[20:06:18] <killallz> |                                                                                               |

[20:06:39] <alexr2> lol ^
[20:06:42] <coldhead> that was magnificent
[20:06:50] <alexr2> that makes me happy

[20:23:06] <spoonybard> http://jsfiddle.net/jbt24/ how can i get the price only? Im getting the text along with some \t\t\t\t junk
[20:24:07] <alexr2> have you tried .text()
[20:24:10] <alexr2> instead of .html
[20:24:39] <coldhead> you probably want a regex http://jsfiddle.net/jbt24/1/
[20:24:40] <spoonybard> yes. same problem
[20:25:04] <alexr2> ahh doy... i didn't even read his question haha
[20:25:33] <spoonybard> coldhead, can that regex get all kinds of prices?
[20:25:43] <spoonybard> all forms...
[20:26:06] <coldhead> that regex matches any digits, optionally followed by a . and more digits
[20:26:33] <coldhead> that will match $99.99 and $1 and <euro symbol>777
[20:26:44] <coldhead> but also 20 Liters
[20:27:26] <spoonybard> TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null
[20:28:00] <coldhead> ah
[20:28:06] <coldhead> sorry, [0] will suffice in this case
[20:28:07] <coldhead> not [1]
[20:28:27] <quuxman> I have a Range object from a document set to designMode. I want to remove anything that's not text from this range, while transforming <br>s into newlines, or simply not touching <br>s

[20:30:26] <quuxman> I guess that designMode is 'on' is irrelevant
[20:33:02] <coldhead> spoonybard: make it more conditionally then http://jsfiddle.net/jbt24/2/
[20:33:29] <shoky> raj im waiting..............
[20:33:43] <raj> it's not giving me the error in jsfiddle
[20:33:48] <shoky> heh
[20:33:51] <raj> i've been trying to get the damn error forever
[20:34:28] <raj> i know what line is causing it, but I dunno why that line isn't causing it in jsfiddle
[20:34:37] <shoky> well you can show what you got and explain what error you get
[20:34:51] <shoky> or fiddle some more ;p
[20:36:31] <coldhead> spoonybard: this works for me http://jsfiddle.net/jbt24/3/
[20:38:20] <spoonybard> it works!!
[20:38:58] <coldhead> hooray
[20:39:09] <coldhead> regular expressions are totally awesome to the max
[20:43:22] <ansdev1> http://pastebin.com/3qEhxd4i  my log is saying number but the output html is NaN
[20:43:26] <ansdev1> can someone shed some light?
[20:47:38] <raj> shoky, figured it out
[20:47:56] <raj> I was trying to use http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drop/demo/selection while I had a document drag handler already
[20:48:08] <spoonybard> coldhead, where did you learn regex?
[20:48:15] <raj> hidden elsewhere in my code
[20:48:18] <ansdev1> http://pastebin.com/3qEhxd4i  my log is saying number but the output html is NaN
[20:48:19] <ansdev1> can someone shed some light?
[20:48:21] <raj> what a waste of 4 hours
[20:48:46] <coldhead> spoonybard: from perl, i think
[20:48:56] <spoonybard> ansdev1, Note: If the first character cannot be converted to a number, parseInt() returns NaN.
[20:50:35] <spoonybard> does jquery have a parseInt() function?
[20:50:44] <coldhead> ansdev1: http://jsfiddle.net/wkxSV/
[20:50:53] <coldhead> you have too much parseInt()
[20:51:48] <coldhead> also you should provide the second base argument to parseInt or leading 0s will break your heart
[20:51:58] <spoonybard> i tried parseInt() with my case but kept getting NaN
[20:52:21] <coldhead> ?eval parseInt('0111')
[20:52:24] <bot-t> coldhead: 73
[20:52:29] <coldhead> ?eval parseInt('0111', 10)
[20:52:29] <bot-t> coldhead: 111
[20:52:50] <coldhead> ?eval ~~'0111'
[20:52:50] <bot-t> coldhead: 111
[20:54:59] <coldhead> spoonybard: something like this will save you hundreds of hours in your career http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do?green=A4614078-11E8-5932-07C1-E9DE9D57232E&cmp=af-mybuy-9780596528126.IP
[20:55:17] <coldhead> also http://xkcd.com/208/
[20:56:41] <spoonybard> http://xkcd.com/209/   lol?
[20:57:54] <coldhead> hahahha that too
[20:58:24] <ansdev1> coldhead: the parseInts came after the problem
[20:59:29] <ansdev1> it's ok, figgured out the problem, an extra span got added where the price to remove was coming from
[20:59:51] <coldhead> i still maintain you had an unnecessary parseInt
[21:00:12] <coldhead> but great job
[21:12:39] <shoky> raj sweet ;)
[21:22:53] <raj> I'm doing this--> $('.container').append("div " + "id='" + data[i].id + "' class='single-image'></div>") ... but I need to bind something to the .single-image being added
[21:23:10] <raj> is there a better way to add that div to the dom so I can bind something to ti?
[21:24:43] <Cork> var newDiv = $("<div/>", { id: data[i].id, class: "single-image"}); newDiv.on();  $('.container').append(newDiv);
[21:26:41] <raj> thank you Cork
[21:26:52] <raj> out of curiosity, is there yet another way?
[21:27:12] <Cork> you could make one long line of it
[21:27:19] <Cork> but that would start beeing messy
[21:27:42] <raj> yeah
[21:27:48] <raj> i meant a totally different way
[21:27:51] <raj> but that's cool
[21:27:58] <raj> i was just wondering
[21:28:05] <Cork> other then that, no you would have to use a selector to find it after its added if you don't do it that way
[21:28:17] <raj> gotcha
[21:28:23] <raj> thank you :)
[21:32:16] <lyrae> http://elegantthemes.com/preview/Gleam/  does an does anyone know the name of the plugin for the effect on the menu links?
[21:35:03] <spoonybard> can i pass index to my selector to stay within the range of an each()? $('td.topResultCell',indx).text()
[21:35:16] <Cork> no
[21:35:23] <Cork> ?.eq @ spoonybard
[21:35:31] <Cork> bah
[21:35:37] <spoonybard> how cani stay within the range then
[21:35:38] <Cork> spoonybard: use .eq(index)
[21:35:47] <raj> Cork, what if I wanted "id='imageid_" + data[i].id + "'" ?
[21:36:01] <raj> oh wait
[21:36:02] <raj> sorry
[21:36:04] <raj> bad question
[21:36:05] <Cork> :)
[21:36:24] <raj> derrp
[21:37:42] <Cork> lyrae: have you tried looking in the source?
[21:40:15] <quuxman> I have a document fragment. I want to get the text contents out of it, but with <br>s transformed to newlines
[21:40:58] <Cork> quuxman: .text should give you that if i remember correctly
[21:41:00] <quuxman> fragment.textContent is almost what I want, but it strips all the newlines out
[21:41:24] <Cork> $(fragment).text()
[21:41:36] <quuxman> same problem
[21:42:04] <Cork> ya... innerText/textContent is a bit messy
[21:42:17] <Cork> so regex then, no other way
[21:42:44] <quuxman> I can at least crawl the dom tree of the fragment
[21:43:15] <Cork> extracting it as html is prob simpler
[21:43:25] <Cork> and faster
[21:43:59] <f0rkn1ght> anyone got some kewl examples I can play with ? dont care what category just post my name if you post one so i can check it out
[21:45:06] <quuxman> Cork: how do you even do that? And no it's not simpler... newlines are created with <div>s in Chrome
[21:46:01] <Cork> quuxman: your talking about content editable or something?
[21:46:25] <quuxman> Cork: nevermind. That is irrelevant
[21:46:39] <Cork> quuxman: if you could create an example in jsfiddle it would help
[21:46:44] <quuxman> but yes, this is part of a text editing project
[21:47:06] <quuxman> (so help me God)
[21:47:16] <Cork> quuxman: well you use .html() to serialize the dom
[21:47:39] <quuxman> that returns null
[21:47:49] <quuxman> AFAIU, jQuery doesn't really support document fragments
[21:48:04] <Cork> ah, you mean real fragments
[21:48:11] <Cork> well it does
[21:48:14] <quuxman> this came from a range
[21:48:18] <Cork> you just need to use it as the document
[21:48:36] <quuxman> range.extractContents(), to be specific
[21:49:40] <quuxman> the issue is pasting text. All sorts of fucked up HTML can get pasted into the designMode frame, and so I figured out how to capture the pasted content in a range (which I thought would be the hard part), but actually removing all the weird stuff is the hard part
[21:51:12] <Cork> quuxman: well if its parsed to a dom, you at least can count on having valid html
[21:51:25] <quuxman> just for the sake of discussion, capturing the pasted content in a range is not trivial. I have to grab the cursor position from the window's "selection" after every event that can change the content, then do the same after a paste event (you can't intercept paste events in any browser), then construct a new range out of those
[21:51:26] <Cork> that makes regexing much simpler
[21:51:59] <quuxman> (I'm relying on the behavior of the cursor moving to the end of the pasted content)
[21:52:21] <quuxman> but I don't know how to get the HTML content from a range
[21:52:24] <quuxman> or document fragment
[21:55:03] <quuxman> it would be wonderful if there was some sort of remove format command in the designMode API, wouldn't it?
[21:59:20] <lyrae> Cork
[21:59:59] <lyrae> yes i have. but i can't figure out which one it is. I know it's not easy,address,jscrolling or mousewheel
[22:00:06] <lyrae> that leaves custom.js and didnt see anything in there
[22:07:52] <andey> Hi sorry to interrupt, but has anyone ever had problems sending ajax calls where it would send a GET instead of a POST. (http://i.imgur.com/lM6Qr.png) this literally sends GET's. Does anyone know why?
[22:09:03] <coldhead> jsonp can't do POST
[22:09:22] <andey> oh
[22:09:32] <andey> can i send a post in any way?
[22:10:01] <coldhead> not across domains
[22:10:23] <coldhead> if its the same domain then don't use jsonp
[22:10:33] <coldhead> and lose the http://etc/ from the URL
[22:10:35] <coldhead> make it relative
[22:10:37] <coldhead> and hapy times
[22:10:47] <andey> okay thank you very much
[22:11:23] <coldhead> good luck
[23:04:09] <raj> this is valid, no? if (!$targ && (!e.ctrlKey || !e.shiftKey)) return anotherfunc()
[23:04:33] <raj> so don't return anotherfunc if ctrl or shift key are pressed during the click
[23:08:27] <raj> nm
[23:13:48] <lijzzz> pooooi
[23:13:55] <lijzzz> nobody here?
[23:14:23] <coldhead> that's right lijzzz, assume the worst
[23:15:08] <lijzzz> u have a cold head?
[23:15:20] <coldhead> sometimes
[23:15:36] <lijzzz> lol
[23:15:47] <coldhead> but enough of this delightful banter, what seems to be the problem, officer?
[23:16:25] <lijzzz> lemme explain
[23:16:56] <lijzzz> i have used a jquery ajax call
[23:17:12] <coldhead> i'm with you so far
[23:17:29] <lijzzz> lemme post the code in fiddle 4 u
[23:18:07] <lijzzz> cold head now ur head is cold or hot?
[23:18:28] <lijzzz> this is the link coldhead
[23:18:31] <lijzzz> http://jsfiddle.net/eBj27/
[23:23:44] <lijzzz> haaaa
[23:26:18] <lijzzz> y everybody comes and quit
[23:26:22] <raj> coldhead, when dynamically creating an element, how can I bind something that's bound to that element elsewhere (but it's bound to those elements, in the same class, that were already in the dom)
[23:26:33] <raj> so I don't have to duplicate the binding code
[23:26:58] <Whirl3d> to smoke a cigarette?
[23:27:03] <raj> however, the other code has custom binding methods
[23:27:07] <raj> and don't use .bind()
[23:32:20] <coldhead> sorry lijzzz, i was vomiting
[23:33:10] <coldhead> lijzzz: you are trying to submit to this url url: $('#hdn_' + element[1]).attr("value"),
[23:33:12] <lijzzz> coldhead wat hap?
[23:33:14] <coldhead> that isn't a url
[23:33:22] <lijzzz> its a url
[23:33:23] <coldhead> that's a hash fragment
[23:33:57] <coldhead> if you go to aids.com/#lol in your browser, the server will give you aids.com/index.html and your browser will find the #lol bit for you
[23:33:58] <lijzzz> coldhead i wil give u the html
[23:34:06] <coldhead> but the server doesn't know about the #lol bit
[23:34:10] <coldhead> that's just for the browser
[23:34:15] <coldhead> so you can't send ajax there
[23:35:19] <coldhead> oh i see what you're doing
[23:35:23] <coldhead> my god, you madman
[23:35:35] <coldhead> in that case .attr('value') should actually be .val()
[23:35:46] <lijzzz> my prob is that the ajax function is getting called a hell number of times
[23:35:51] <Whirl3d> Is there an equivalent to extend that limits the configurabnle or extendable attributes to the source object's attributes?
[23:35:59] <coldhead> also if you were on my team and you were trying to code it in this incredibly complicated way we would have a very serious meeting about your future
[23:36:44] <devOlsen_> was he trying to do a hash history thing?
[23:36:46] <coldhead> lijzzz: $(document).click is probably a little bit too general
[23:36:47] <dr0id> sup colzy, check dis http://jsfiddle.net/AAKcP/1/
[23:37:30] <lijzzz> coldhead that code was given by nFFF yesterday when i was struggling
[23:37:32] <coldhead> lijzzz: maybe you could use this http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/docs/files/jquery-ba-throttle-debounce-js.html
[23:37:37] <lijzzz> what is the other option v have
[23:37:41] <coldhead> nFFF is a known trouble maker
[23:37:47] <lijzzz> :)
[23:37:47] <coldhead> and subversive
[23:38:12] <coldhead> hey cool dr0idsy
[23:38:15] <coldhead> you stole the googles
[23:38:45] <lijzzz> hi hi i wish i were not in ur team
[23:38:59] <dr0id> not me someone else, just found da linkz
[23:39:08] <coldhead> likewise, lijzzz
[23:39:17] <coldhead> this is the worst team ever
[23:39:25] <coldhead> HR must have been smoking crack
[23:39:33] <ZeZu> It seems like .tabs() is resizing everything in the container with it,  is this by design / can be changed in css?
[23:39:37] <lijzzz> coldhead actually i was binding the images using MVC and C#
[23:39:46] <coldhead> oh my sweet lord
[23:39:52] <lijzzz> and i wanted to give an edit for the title of the image
[23:39:59] <devOlsen_> could also use an ajax manager to kill any repeated requests.
[23:40:05] <lijzzz> for that i used jquery
[23:40:07] <coldhead> devOlsen_++
[23:40:15] <lijzzz> and ajax call for saving that title
[23:41:03] <lijzzz> but now the problem is that my controller method is getting fired a number of times
[23:41:18] <lijzzz> as i click on the save
[23:41:19] <devOlsen_> http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/ajaxManager/
[23:41:36] <lijzzz> wat is this for
[23:41:45] <lijzzz> coldhead u went for vomiting again?
[23:41:54] <coldhead> lijzzz: why are you binding $(document).click() if you only care about the save button
[23:42:20] <coldhead> don't you want $('.save_button').click() ?
[23:42:25] <coldhead> or something similar?
[23:42:35] <lijzzz> yesterday i i was trying the save button click, but since i have a blur event also it was not firing the save button click
[23:43:16] <coldhead> $('input').blur(function () {$('.save_button').trigger('click')})
[23:43:19] <lijzzz> it was firing the blur event instead of button click when i was trying to click the save button
[23:43:31] <coldhead> pretty sure its better to fix that than use $(document).click()
[23:43:46] <lijzzz> i dont want the save button click to be fired in the blur event my dear
[23:44:35] <coldhead> i'm very unclear on what you do want
[23:44:43] <lijzzz> ooh my god
[23:44:51] <lijzzz> how wil i make this guys understand
[23:44:51] <coldhead> but i am pretty sure you don't want $(document).click
[23:44:56] <devOlsen_> 8.5 unicorns?
[23:44:56] <coldhead> or fuck, maybe you do
[23:45:04] <coldhead> it is literally my first day using jQuery
[23:45:09] <coldhead> maybe that's the way everyone does it
[23:45:20] <coldhead> $(document).click( ALL THE THINGS )
[23:45:36] <coldhead> look what you did, you made miketaylr quit with your nonsense
[23:45:46] <lijzzz> no
[23:45:49] <devOlsen_> well coldhead, its a cheaper method to use a global event listener than a bunch of click events or even worse
[23:45:49] <lijzzz> i didnt do
[23:45:51] <devOlsen_> live events.
[23:46:01] <devOlsen_> thus, you can set one and use cheap conditions.
[23:46:28] <lijzzz> u tel me a sulution then
[23:46:29] <mikeric> is there a way to select all elements that have an attribute starting with "data-bind-"?
[23:47:09] <devOlsen_> however I would reserve that for you know something less global than document ;)
[23:47:23] <Cork> mikeric: you would have to loop filter a selection on all elements in the page
[23:47:55] <devOlsen_> mikeric any attribute that has that?
[23:48:04] <devOlsen_> that would be very expensive to hunt for.
[23:49:31] <devOlsen_> $('*[**="data-bind-"]') might work
[23:49:32] <coldhead> lijzzz: i would use something like this http://jsfiddle.net/uXACL/
[23:49:43] <devOlsen_> don't know if ** will work as intended.
[23:49:52] <coldhead> i understand you probably need to make it fancier to work with any number of inputs
[23:49:57] <Cork> devOlsen: you can't have * in attribute selectors
[23:50:04] <Cork> only for values
[23:50:12] <coldhead> harsh, Cork
[23:50:22] <devOlsen_> hmm http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[23:50:26] <coldhead> you're shattering dreams
[23:50:36] <devOlsen_> but I would understand if you were saying for attribute type decliration.
[23:50:42] <devOlsen_> I was just guessing for that.
[23:51:17] <Cork> devOlsen: it is
[23:51:28] <Cork> "*=" is a selector for values
[23:51:29] <devOlsen_> coldhead heh I just wanted to see him use it, it work and then his next question be.. why did my browser crash?
[23:51:34] <devOlsen_> yeah
[23:51:36] <Cork> theres nothing to select all attributes
[23:51:44] <devOlsen_> thank god.
[23:51:49] <coldhead> lijzzz: http://jsfiddle.net/uXACL/1/
[23:52:00] <lijzzz> wats this
[23:52:10] <coldhead> its more salt for your wounds
[23:52:16] <devOlsen_> haha
[23:52:17] <coldhead> next up: salt for your earth
[23:52:25] <coldhead> so that nothing may grow
[23:53:31] <lijzzz> hi hi
[23:53:50] <lijzzz> now i got wounded more
[23:54:43] <beasty> morning
[23:54:54] <coldhead> its going to be okay, lijzzz
[23:55:16] <coldhead> hiya beastsy
[23:55:49] <sente> can someone go to http://sente.cc/voro/ with chrome and tell me if they see if they see a jquery warning message like in this screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/RksS1.png
[23:55:56] <sente> i dunno what the deal is
[23:56:24] <coldhead> i don't get that error in chrome sente
[23:56:29] <lijzzz> i bcame busy now
[23:56:30] <coldhead> i just get a damn fine looking animation
[23:56:34] <coldhead> melting my CPU
[23:56:43] <coldhead> ?csb3 @ lijzzz
[23:56:43] <bot-t1> lijzzz, http://i.imgur.com/X7DSh.jpg
[23:56:53] <beasty> morning coldhead ... shouldn't you be asleep ?
[23:57:18] <coldhead> 5pm, getting there
[23:57:22] <sente> well wtf
[23:57:37] <sente> i can't figure out where its coming from
[23:57:48] <coldhead> sente: a plugin maybe?
[23:57:53] <coldhead> sorry "chrome extension"
[23:57:54] <raj> coldhead, any answer for me?
[23:58:11] <beasty> coldhead: damn 9am here
[23:58:40] <Cork> heh lovely code :)
[23:58:41] <Cork> $('*').filter(function() { var exist = false; $.each(this.attributes, function(i, attr) { exist = attr.name.search(/data-bind-/) !== -1; if(exist) { return false; } }); return exist; });
[23:58:41] <coldhead> raj: i think you're asking how you can extract the event handler for #b and attach it to #a
[23:58:52] <coldhead> raj: never do that
[23:59:04] <coldhead> use on() and bind it once and once only
[23:59:14] <coldhead> and if that's not what you mean, i am going to get a beer
[23:59:30] <sente> yeah..some extension
[23:59:32] <sente> fishy
[23:59:41] <raj> coldhead, but I've got the binding on <div class="somediv"></div> ... but I'm creating .somediv dyanamically as well, and I'd like to add the same bindings to the dynamically created ones
