[00:27:09] <dokma> Is this conflict safe? (function($) { $.fn.func = function() { whatever; return this; }; })(jQuery);
[00:32:09] <mist> ./52
[01:18:56] <anli_> How can console.log(window) output null?
[01:33:39] <dokma> seems like I'm misunderstanding something... why is the url not right here? $('a').click(function (e) { $.get({ url: $(this).attr('href'); }); });
[02:19:54] <dokma> this works: $.get($(this).attr('href')); this doesn't: $.get({ url: $(this).attr('href'); }); in a link click handler
[02:20:05] <dokma> I'm obviously missing something in my picture
[02:20:10] <dokma> anyone care to clarify?

[02:39:16] <brunoais> motaka2, ask again please
[02:39:55] <brunoais> dokma, did you try reading the manual?

[02:41:08] <dokma> brunoais, of $.get ?
[02:41:21] <brunoais> dokma, yes.

[03:04:16] <jQueryGuest> morning!
[03:04:58] <jQueryGuest> can smoeone explain why jQuery `.width()` has different results in Chrome and FF in this very very simle HTML: http://jsfiddle.net/f35j2/3/
[03:52:22] <nodedfree> when i send ajax call i get return value of []
[03:52:32] <nodedfree> how can i treat that empty value?
[03:52:58] <nodedfree> i tried-> data='', data=' ', data=null, data=undefined
[03:53:10] <nodedfree> also data='[]'
[03:54:07] <Axman6> what do you mean by "how can I treat that emoty value"?
[03:56:12] <nodedfree> i want to add if condition, what happend if the array return empty
[03:56:34] <nodedfree> i did jQuery.parseJSON
[04:04:30] <jQueryGuest> nodedfree: if you use `=` inside your IF you are assiging not comparing. You need to use `==`
[04:04:58] <nodedfree> jQueryGuest, it was for example only. actually i'm using !==
[04:05:28] <nodedfree> nvm, solved by another way
[04:14:31] <motaka2> How can I make unchecked checkbox values available in post or get ?

[04:47:20] <papifabi> ha yes,perhaps,i always mix the two :D
[04:48:19] <paulvd> or .split
[05:41:33] <Elephantman> hi :) .css adds a style to my html element, is there a way to modify the global stylesheet (so that the new style applies to the elements that will be created further down the road) ?
[05:52:52] <paulvd> Elephantman: just give them the same class name and write the style in the css file ?
[06:17:09] <hives> hey I was wondering if someone could help me: Im using a banner slider and after a while on my site it freezes up and I get unresponsive script .... jquery-1.4.min.js
[06:24:15] <brunoais> hives, update jQuery, if posible
[06:24:59] <hives> why? is it an issue with that version of jquery?
[06:27:13] <hives> how do i load the latest version from google?
[06:31:31] <Mmm123m> hello i have question
[06:31:35] <mogaj> I am have a json object and using one of the data in that object am getting another json object how can add this second object to first set of object .... for example what i am trying to do is http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/u6g6A/ ... how can i achieve this in jquery?
[06:33:48] <Mmm123m> If i have .js script on MIT License, and i little edit it, do I have to include a note about this?
[06:35:52] <Axman6> read the licence :\
[06:37:45] <Mmm123m> i read but i'am stupid and i need to ask on irc
[06:38:20] <Axman6> do you have a link to the licence?
[06:49:53] <Mmm123m> yes is simple and short http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
[06:53:49] <Axman6> well, it seems pretty clear, you can do basically whatever you want with it as long as the licence text is included with it
[06:54:54] <Mmm123m> good. the same i read on polish website
[06:59:51] <Jisan> i need a jquery image gallery plugin, where a big image of the product at the top and 3 small thumbnails at the bottom, for ecommerce site
[06:59:54] <Jisan> is there any plugin for that?
[07:01:05] <paulvd> Jisan: there are hundreds
[07:01:36] <paulvd> I like bxslider so I use that > http://bxslider.com/examples/thumbnail-pager-1
[07:01:56] <Jisan> paulvd , also i need one that has zooming feature
[07:03:09] <paulvd> zooming on hover
[07:03:09] <paulvd> ?
[07:04:09] <Jisan> yes
[07:04:22] <Jisan> not vital though
[07:04:30] <Jisan> i'm checking out the bxslider
[07:04:37] <paulvd> would be hard to find one that has zoom
[07:05:49] <Jisan> bxslider is awesome
[07:06:00] <Jisan> it has a wordpress plugin too i guess
[07:06:17] <paulvd> yer
[07:06:38] <paulvd> https://wordpress.org/plugins/bxslider-integration/screenshots/
[07:34:32] <hives> hey, when I was using an older version of jquery i got an error unresponsive script .... jquery-1.4.min.js, now im loading the latest jquery it does not give that error... fixed great, just wondering why the older version caused this though?
[07:48:13] <paulvd> hives: jquery 1.4 is the stone age
[07:48:39] <hives> I see... sorry for the noob question, I guess I just wanted to try and understand why that version caused that error
[07:48:39] <paulvd> is 1.11 now
[07:49:03] <hives> im using jquery-1.8.3
[07:49:22] <paulvd> is the same thing when you dont update your anti virus
[07:49:30] <paulvd> new virus wont be detected then
[07:49:32] <hives> I see
[07:49:48] <hives> well thanks for your help, I was just about to throw my macbook out of the window
[07:50:16] <paulvd> let me know when if you still gonna do that, i'll be outside
[07:50:20] <paulvd> know if*
[07:50:29] <hives> hehe
[07:54:27] <uskerine> hi, i am not being able to get the HTML of a datatables cell. I do: var rows = $('#newInvoiceTable').dataTable().fnGetNodes();   alert(rows[i].cells[0]);  to get a [object HTMLTableCellElement], but how can I get the HTML content of that cell? thanks
[07:56:32] <systemfault> uskerine: $(rows[i].cells[0]).text() ?
[07:56:48] <systemfault> .html() if you want the actual html
[07:57:48] <uskerine> thanks, .html
[07:58:37] <uskerine> what about If that HTMLTableCellElement has an <input> tag an I want to retrieve the "value" attribute ?
[07:59:27] <systemfault> $(rows[i].cells[0]).find('input').val()
[08:00:46] <uskerine> that does not work
[08:01:11] <uskerine> sorry
[08:01:13] <uskerine> wait
[08:01:27] <uskerine> it does
[08:01:29] <uskerine> thanks systemfault
[08:02:04] <uskerine> I read that there is also something named firstChild
[08:02:22] <uskerine> could it be also used here? -the <td> field has only an <input>
[08:03:04] <systemfault> It's not jquery but sure: $(rows[i].cells[0].firstChild).val()
[08:03:42] <uskerine> understood, there I would be using pure Javascript, right?
[08:04:05] <systemfault> .firstChild is pure DOM, yes.
[08:04:10] <uskerine> thanks
[08:04:25] <systemfault> rows[i].cells[0].firstChild.value without jQuery
[08:51:28] <Tomashe> Hey guys, i have a n object with multiple objects inside, there is a way to search in that object for example for object specficic object.id ?
[08:52:17] <jParkton> array
[08:52:19] <jParkton> ?
[08:55:42] <Jattenalle> Tomashe, look up Object.keys()
[08:56:08] <Jattenalle> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[08:57:06] <jParkton> thats the one
[08:57:08] <Jattenalle> $(Object.keys(myObject)).whatever
[08:57:20] <Jattenalle> for example: .each()
[08:58:15] <d0de> do I _need_ to install jsdom to use jQuery on node.js ?
[08:58:35] <Jattenalle> no
[09:01:28] <d0de> Jattenalle, it's just that whenever I try to do anything, I get "throw new Error( "jQuery requires a window with a document"
[09:01:55] <Jattenalle> that's a different question
[09:01:57] <Jattenalle> :)
[09:02:22] <paulvd> can anybody recommend a slider which is vertical roundabout type slider ?
[09:02:24] <d0de> how can I solve that issue please? I was googling and the answer seemed to be "install jsdom", but that introduced lots of new problems
[09:02:45] <ntnd> Hey, I want to add the value of textboxes following the name scheme field0, field1, fieldn to an array, how can I select these inputs with jquery? They only have generic names because the user can generate more
[09:11:15] <paulvd> can anybody recommend a slider which is vertical roundabout type slider ?
[09:15:10] <d0de> paulvd, what is a vertical roundabout type?
[09:26:35] <paulvd> d0de: i can give you an example in pm if you want
[09:28:46] <paulvd> i tried one and modified it but its shaky and not working smooth also
[09:37:54] <d0de> paulvd, I don't know if I can help or not, I just have no idea what a "roundabout" type slider is
[09:38:18] <d0de> I think it would be helpful to post here explaining what you mean
[09:43:13] <Tomashe> hmm
[09:43:38] <Tomashe> Jattenalle: there is a way to know if object exit in same way
[09:43:51] <Jattenalle> exist?
[09:44:12] <Jattenalle> if(myObject)
[09:44:21] <Jattenalle> or if(myobject!=undefined)
[09:44:27] <Tomashe> i know
[09:44:33] <Jattenalle> or if(typeof myobject != 'undefined')
[09:44:43] <Tomashe> but i mean if i got an an array with multiple objects
[09:44:50] <Tomashe> do i have to run loop on that object to check that?
[09:45:05] <Jattenalle> if(somearray[x].someobject)
[09:45:22] <Jattenalle> if you want to be suer safe, you should also if(somearray[x])
[09:46:16] <Tomashe> hmm
[09:46:39] <Jattenalle> also, most (all?) modern browsers have early escape
[09:46:50] <Tomashe> let me check
[09:47:11] <Jattenalle> so you can do: if(typeof somearray[x] !='undefined' && typeof somearray[x].myobject != 'undefined'){ do stuff with somearray[x].myobject }
[09:47:52] <Tomashe> my issue is more complicated
[09:48:21] <Jattenalle> there's no other way, you just have to check if it's not certain an object exists at any given time
[09:48:26] <Tomashe> i got 2 objects each contain multiple sub objects  for example like object[0] have few sub objects inside .. and i ned to compare them all
[09:48:35] <Tomashe> to see if they are match or not
[09:48:39] <Jattenalle> yeah, you just have to check them all
[09:48:46] <paulvd> d0de: something like this > http://tinyurl.com/mhvypku
[09:48:56] <paulvd> is not complete, but you will get an idea
[09:49:01] <Jattenalle> Tomashe, or do you mean you have two arrays and you need to compare them against each other?
[09:49:08] <Tomashe> exactly
[09:49:18] <paulvd> anyone can suggest a slider similar to this > http://tinyurl.com/mhvypku
[09:49:24] <Tomashe> both made from JSON.parse(data)
[09:49:25] <paulvd> or a carousel or whatever it is
[09:50:07] <Jattenalle> Tomashe, you just have an outer loop going through object1, and an inner loop going through object2
[09:50:25] <Jattenalle> so for each item in object1 you go over all items in object2, if it matches you just early exit out of that loop
[09:50:41] <Tomashe> is that most effeicent way to do it ?
[09:50:55] <Jattenalle> for(object1){ for(object2){ if(object1 == object2){break} } }
[09:51:08] <Jattenalle> it's the most straight forward, and if you dont know the composition of the two objects, yes
[09:52:00] <Tomashe> ok
[09:52:02] <Tomashe> i wil ldo that
[09:52:19] <Jattenalle> if your objects are sorted in some way, say ascending (a to z, 0 to 9)
[09:52:26] <Jattenalle> then you can early cull pretty easily
[09:52:45] <Jattenalle> if: if the item from object1 is b, and you're currently checking against c in object2, you can just exit out
[09:52:53] <Jattenalle> since it'll just be later letters after that in object2
[09:53:14] <Jattenalle> stuff like that, but unless you have tens of thousands of items, or you do it very frequently, it wont really matter
[09:55:31] <Tomashe> im trying :)
[09:55:41] <Tomashe> i need to do it frequently
[09:55:47] <Tomashe> like every few seconds
[09:55:59] <Jattenalle> well, how many items?
[09:56:00] <Tomashe> a compare betwween 2 arrays that can contain up to 100 items
[09:56:05] <Jattenalle> yeah that's fine
[09:56:08] <Tomashe> ok
[09:56:10] <Tomashe> :)
[09:56:11] <systemfault> lol, 100 items.
[09:56:14] <Jattenalle> worst case is 10'000 iterations.. that's nothing
[09:56:23] <Tomashe> im doing it on Mobile
[09:56:30] <Jattenalle> even then it's fine
[09:56:32] <Tomashe> ok
[09:56:42] <Jattenalle> but you should really see if you cant do it in a better way
[09:57:03] <Jattenalle> hard for me to say though since i dont know what exactly you're doing
[09:58:17] <Jattenalle> actually, systemfault, you know if it's safe to just do if(something != undefined) to check if something exists or not?
[09:58:27] <Jattenalle> or if typeof something != 'undefined' is the only way to be safe?
[09:58:31] <Jattenalle> modern browsers, obviously
[09:58:41] <systemfault> Jattenalle: !== undefined is fine.
[09:58:49] <Jattenalle> oh, the type compare as well?
[09:58:54] <Jattenalle> it !== not !=
[09:58:56] <systemfault> undefined cannot be redefined on any recent browser.
[09:59:26] <systemfault> >> (void 0) === undefined
[09:59:36] <systemfault> js> (void 0) === undefined
[09:59:40] <b-ot> systemfault: No output.
[09:59:40] <systemfault> Oh well..
[09:59:51] <systemfault> The bot sucks here.
[09:59:55] <Jattenalle> js> something!==undefined
[10:00:00] <b-ot> Jattenalle: No output.
[10:00:03] <Jattenalle> :(
[10:00:13] <Jattenalle> js> something==undefined
[10:00:13] <systemfault> js> console.log((void 0) === undefined)
[10:00:17] <b-ot> Jattenalle: No output.
[10:00:22] <b-ot> systemfault: No output.
[10:00:26] <Jattenalle> lol
[10:00:30] <systemfault> Useful bot.
[10:00:51] <Jattenalle> js> typeof something==undefined
[10:01:08] <b-ot> Jattenalle: No output.
[10:01:12] <Jattenalle> heh
[10:01:15] <systemfault> Anyway… the typeof foo !== 'undefined' is for ES3 where undefined could be redefined.
[10:03:12] <sacho> typeof foo !== 'undefined' is because !== is a strict comparison and typeof's value is a string
[10:03:26] <sacho> or did you mean compared to !== undefined
[10:03:35] <sacho> ah, ok.
[10:03:56] <sacho> hey, there's a bot here!
[10:04:04] <systemfault> A broken bot.
[10:04:10] <systemfault> js> 2 + 2
[10:04:27] <systemfault> And slow too…
[10:04:31] <Jattenalle> lol
[10:04:37] <Jattenalle> math too complex
[10:04:37] <sacho> js> ping me an error
[10:04:57] <Jattenalle> 2+2 killed it, poor thing
[10:05:26] <systemfault> Jattenalle: It probably required too much CPU and timed out :/
[10:05:45] <b-ot> sacho: No output.
[10:05:50] <b-ot> systemfault: No output.
[10:05:59] <systemfault> Awesome.
[10:06:02] <Jattenalle> lol
[10:06:41] <sacho_> no output, man, no output
[10:12:49] <donmatthew> someone here who has tried out amcharts for stocks? candlebar diagram?
[10:13:02] <donmatthew> have*
[10:44:01] <Tomashe> Jattenalle: in additional , i was wondering maybe i should provide one object and build my object array on client side , instead of bring big json with multidimentions and compare it
[10:53:03] <Jattenalle> Tomashe, do whichever requires you to do the least things later on
[10:53:13] <Jattenalle> one expensive thing once, is better than thousands of cheap things
[10:54:27] <paulvd> there is a carousel on top here > http://tinyurl.com/mhvypku can anyone recommend me a carousel similar to that, which will function like that ?
[10:57:23] <ggherdov> Hi. What would be the modern "bible" of webdesign? I mean, I was familiar with CSS1 and HTML <5 , but lost contact with the topic a while ago and need a technical brush-up.
[11:07:52] <donmatthew> ggherdov: just code and you'll be back
[11:10:51] <ggherdov> donmatthew: makes sense :)
[11:15:58] <Tomashe> three is a way that a big json will give me " Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier "
[11:47:42] <Tomashe> how do i add object inside an object?
[11:48:37] <Tomashe> obect = {}; object.data = {} ?
[11:55:07] <shoky> sure
[12:03:17] <scriptThis> If you guys are dynamically building lists (<ul> w/ child <li>) from an $.ajax() call, are you making each ul item it's own #id to be able to append to it with the returned JSON?
[12:04:30] <systemfault> scriptThis: I usually add an attribute data-id
[12:05:00] <systemfault> You just $.map the array
[12:06:16] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/5Tygp/638/ Why this works only once ?
[12:08:21] <donmatthew> Hi all, I'm using amcharts (candlestick), but can't this code to work: http://pastebin.com/74UyUTE0
[12:08:40] <donmatthew> no errors are showing up and console.log gives everything exactly like a working example I have
[12:09:24] <systemfault> rabbi1: That code works as intended. Please explain what you would like it to do.
[12:12:54] <the_voice_> Let me start off this conversation with I hate explorer
[12:14:16] <rabbi1> systemfault: one of the person is helping, thanks .. brb
[12:15:28] <the_voice_> I am trying to open a modal that is in a full screen(width) iframe
[12:15:32] <the_voice_> in chrome and firefox it works fine
[12:15:36] <scriptThis> rabbi1, is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/87229/
[12:15:42] <the_voice_> in IE it scrolls to the tool of the page whenever it is opening
[12:15:51] <the_voice_> *top
[12:16:08] <rabbi1> scriptThis: nope, thanks anyway
[12:16:24] <scriptThis> np
[12:44:52] <the_voice_> figured out how to solve it
[12:45:09] <the_voice_> if anyone runs into the problem, change overflow:hidden to overflow:visible
[13:01:33] <vacho> gents, I know this channel does not support 3rd party libraries, and I totally understand if I can't get any help on this here. But I am hoping someone can tell me how to call the function .slider('getValue') that is documented here: http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-slider/
[13:11:40] <shoky> vacho:  you just call it on your slider element.. var value = $('#myslider').slider('getValue');
[13:15:17] <vacho> shoky: that worked!! now I am trying to pass the "max" parameter this way, but it's not being honored: jQuery("#ex6").slider({min: 100, max: 500});
[13:15:57] <shoky> vacho: i assume you can only set that in the first call, when you're initializing the slider. (and you should do that only once)
[13:16:13] <vacho> shoky:  I only initialize it once and that's there I am doing it.
[13:16:46] <shoky> vacho: then i don't know. maybe they have a bug. if you make a jsfiddle with it i can try to debug it
[13:17:31] <vacho> shoky: when u look at my code, am I passing the parameter max correctly?
[13:17:43] <shoky> yes
[13:37:14] <Fraz> hi
[13:37:25] <Fraz> how do i preven the problem seen here? http://jsfiddle.net/3NL46/
[13:37:42] <Fraz> when i click a layer, it also registers the click on the group
[13:40:09] <__joshua___> return false in handler, or event.stopPropagation();
[13:41:25] <Fraz> thanks joshua
[14:09:12] <Faryshta> Hi. I am trying to use jquery mobile. I would like to ask. Is there a way to use the same header and footer on all pages?
[14:12:13] <arschmitz> Faryshta: yes put it outside the page
[14:12:32] <arschmitz> Faryshta: in the body
[14:12:49] <Faryshta> arschmitz, thanks
[14:13:02] <arschmitz> Faryshta: your welcome
[14:14:13] <Tomashe> i have an object, and inside it multiple objects , but do i count those multiple inner object
[14:14:19] <Tomashe> object.length isnt working
[14:15:15] <Faryshta> arschmitz, the header is overlapped by the jquery mobile content
[14:21:26] <rmill> js> print( [ 'lol', 'wat', 'u', 'doing?' ].length )
[14:21:31] <b-ot> rmill: 4
[14:22:02] <rmill> ↑ looks like `.length` still works, Tomashe! ;D
[14:25:02] <Faryshta> Hi. I am trying to use jquery mobile. I would like to ask. Is there a way to use the same header and footer on all pages?
[14:27:04] <rmill> Tomashe: You'll have to do something like this for Objects → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223/length-of-javascript-object-ie-associative-array
[14:27:49] <systemfault> I you don't have to support IE8… it can be easier.
[14:27:57] <rmill> yea, "IF"
[14:28:05] <systemfault> Yup
[14:31:17] <rmill> If you're using something like underscore, you can do this → http://underscorejs.org/#size (Or you can just check the annotated source and see how they do it → http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html#section-41)
[14:33:23] <arschmitz> Faryshta: what version are you using?
[14:45:58] <Faryshta> arschmitz, 1.4.2
[15:16:28] <Faryshta> Hi. I am trying to use jquery mobile. I would like to ask. Is there a way to use the same header and footer on all pages?
[15:21:30] <__joshua___> what do you mean by header/footer?  html?
[15:23:15] <__joshua___> is it multiple jq mobile pages in one html doc?
[15:24:57] <__joshua___> is this what you want? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[15:25:14] <__joshua___> (although im guessing that just does fixed position footer)
[15:38:36] <zoidfarb> I want to replace a string of text with a <select> element that uses JQueryUI's combobox. I'm calling replaceWith(...) to create the select element, but then I do .combobox() and I get an error. I think this is because replaceWith() returns the original element (which is now removed) and not the newly created one. What's the best way to get around this?
[15:39:19] <zoidfarb> Is it better to just hide the text, and show the <select>, rather than actually replacing it?
[15:41:23] <Faryshta> __joshua___, i mean dat-
[15:41:30] <Faryshta> __joshua___, data-role="header"
[15:42:16] <__joshua___> right.  didn't see anything obvious in the docs.  so either:  repeat in your server side template, or just clone it in jq onload
[15:43:57] <Faryshta> __joshua___, i am checking persistent toolbars. http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/toolbar-fixed-persistent/
[16:21:09] <oojacoboo> how can you see the data attr in chrome set with $.data() ?
[16:22:19] <rmill> oojacoboo: `.data()` is a getter/setter
[16:22:25] <rmill> so you use it for both
[16:22:37] <oojacoboo> rmill: I'm not asking how to use it though
[16:22:43] <oojacoboo> I'm trying to inspect the dom elements
[16:22:52] <oojacoboo> I know it's in the shadow DOM somewhere
[16:23:25] <rmill> You will not see it in the DOM
[16:23:31] <__joshua___> oojacoboo: if you set first with .data, then jq adds it to its global data object.
[16:23:52] <__joshua___> but if you el.attr('data-mydata', x); ;you will see it in the dom
[16:23:54] <oojacoboo> __joshua___: that's what I thought, where is that in chrome?
[16:24:37] <__joshua___> or if you first create the dom attribute, then .data will use that
[16:25:11] <oojacoboo> I'm not really wanting to alter how I'm doing it - just want to inspect it
[16:25:21] <rmill> yea, you _could_ set the data attr with `attr`, then it'll be in both places
[16:25:24] <__joshua___> right, it should be jQuery.data(element...
[16:25:45] <oojacoboo> __joshua___: is it not avail through the dev tools?
[16:25:51] <rmill> But, that kinda defeats the purpose…
[16:25:52] <__joshua___> yeah,
[16:26:39] <__joshua___> say its on $('.myclass);.  you can get it globally like jQuery.data($('.myclass)[0]) will give all data.
[16:26:47] <__joshua___> but, its just a around about way
[16:27:16] <oojacoboo> right, I figured that.  I just could have sworn it was in the shadow dom objects within chrome's dev tools
[16:27:30] <oojacoboo> I know I've see the jQuery object there before
[16:27:40] <__joshua___> within chromes dev tools?  you mean the dom inspector
[16:27:45] <oojacoboo> yes
[16:27:52] <oojacoboo> it does more than just DOM, but yea :)
[16:28:08] <__joshua___> no but you mean just the dom inspector, right?
[16:28:28] <__joshua___> ie thats where you thought you saw it, not in the js debugger, not in the network analyzer
[16:28:29] <__joshua___> etc
[16:28:35] <oojacoboo> https://www.dropbox.com/s/mw8b0xb4zsvwdwb/Screenshot%202014-06-08%2019.28.32.png
[16:29:02] <shoky> you can see the jquery expando property there
[16:29:09] <shoky> but that's not where the data is stored
[16:29:15] <oojacoboo> shoky: ah
[16:29:18] <shoky> it's just a key into the data cache
[16:29:38] <oojacoboo> so is the only way to see if through the console?
[16:30:25] <__joshua___> yeah, its stored in the internal data cache
[16:30:27] <__joshua___> if its*
[16:30:30] <shoky> yeah. dom inspector shows dom stuff. data is not stored in the dom
[16:30:49] <oojacoboo> I know firefox has a plugin for it
[16:30:54] <oojacoboo> or a firebug extension rather
[16:31:29] <oojacoboo> it's kind of annoying that it's not more clear
[16:31:47] <oojacoboo> it's jQuery that's not using the data-attr right?
[16:31:53] <shoky> what?
[16:32:02] <oojacoboo> and instead just binding to the jQuery object?
[16:32:10] <shoky> what are you asking about..
[16:32:28] <oojacoboo> data-attr and .data() storage
[16:33:11] <shoky> there is .data()  which has nothing to do with data-attr except for the fact that the first time you read with .data() on an element, it also reads from the data-attr and puts that into the data cache for the element
[16:33:24] <shoky> that's the only connection .data() has with data-attrs
[16:33:39] <shoky> it reads from it, once per element
[16:33:40] <oojacoboo> yea, right, I just don't get why .data() isn't using data-attr
[16:33:47] <oojacoboo> other than for compatibility reasons
[16:33:48] <__joshua___> "As of jQuery 1.4.3 HTML 5 data- attributes will be automatically pulled in to jQuery's data object. "
[16:33:55] <shoky> because storing data in the DOM is an evil thing to do
[16:34:17] <oojacoboo> shoky: the HTML5 spec disagrees
[16:34:19] <shoky> you have JS and data-structures to store data
[16:34:22] <oojacoboo> although - I agree with you
[16:34:32] <shoky> data-attrs are fine
[16:34:40] <shoky> storing runtime data on data-attrs is not fine
[16:34:59] <rmill> MEMORY
[16:35:33] <shoky> ^
[16:36:24] <__joshua___> I use it for some test hooks, but i feel dirty when i do so
[16:36:38] <shoky> oojacoboo not to mention that you can't store any data in a DOM attribute
[16:36:43] <shoky> only strings
[16:37:01] <oojacoboo> shoky: yea, you have to encode the stuff, it's not fun
[16:37:05] <shoky> no
[16:37:10] <shoky> well
[16:37:15] <shoky> you can't encode a live function
[16:37:38] <oojacoboo> can't say I've seen the need to have a live function in any type of data-store
[16:37:42] <oojacoboo> but I'm sure there are reasons
[16:38:07] <oojacoboo> I see it more of a data structure storage place than anything else
[16:38:19] <shoky> var options = {..., oncomplete: function() { ... } };  myelement.data('options', options);
[16:38:20] <oojacoboo> if you're putting logic into it, you're probably doing something else wrong
[16:38:24] <shoky> there you go, a function in the data
[16:38:55] <oojacoboo> shoky: in that case, I'd likely have that as part of a callback to set the data as needed
[16:39:15] <oojacoboo> anyway... we're sidetracking now
[16:39:22] <shoky> donno what you mean, but it doesn't matter..
[16:48:42] <wa5ted> heyshoky
[16:48:44] <wa5ted> hey shoky
[17:01:41] <shoky> hey wa5ted
[18:40:54] <adamellsworth> is it possible to $.post within a success: function() { .. } that resides within an $.ajax({ type: "GET" ... })?
[18:42:05] <adamellsworth> because I get some data from an external API then need to post it to an internal route
[18:46:26] <jphase> adamellsworth: yeah you can do that.
[18:50:42] <kyan> Hi! I've got this webpage http://futuramerlin.com/d/r/ember.php?wintNeeded=emberWebView&wint=1&emAction=home&locale=0 I can't figure out why #pageContents isn't fading in when the page loads... I'm not seeing any error messages in the console. Any thoughts?
[19:10:48] <shoky> kyan: you have 2 #pageContents ..
[19:19:38] <LEU> now i have to download jquery i can't put a link to jquery.com page anymore ?
[19:22:06] <BillCriswell> LEU: Did they remove that file?
[19:59:52] <LEU> http://jsfiddle.net/ubx4t/ i don't know why it doesn't make it a menu
[20:01:51] <jphase> LEU: not sure why it would honestly... .menu() is not a native jQuery function
[20:02:06] <LEU> http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[20:02:07] <jphase> you looking for jQuery UI's .menu() perhaps?
[20:02:11] <LEU> here it works
[20:02:13] <jphase> jQuery != jQuery UI
[20:02:20] <LEU> i know
[20:02:22] <jphase> you'll need to include jQuery UI separately
[20:02:40] <jphase> so, since your fiddle doesn't include jQuery UI, then the jQuery UI functions won't work ;)
[20:02:55] <jphase> also, might as well not use old jQuery 1.x libraries while you're at it
[20:04:05] <LEU> i have included jquery ui on my computer
[20:04:18] <LEU> and still don't work
[20:04:39] <LEU> there isn't a pastebin for jquery ui ?
[20:05:52] <LEU> should i include it in head or in body ?
[20:06:31] <jphase> LEU: so when you include jQuery UI in your fiddle, it will work:  http://jsfiddle.net/ubx4t/1/
[20:06:54] <jphase> I included from Google hosted libraries in that fiddle
[20:08:04] <LEU> so i have to include jQuery UI.css also
[20:08:29] <LEU> what version have you included because i can't figure it out
[20:09:01] <jphase> I included 1.10.4 from Google:  https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery-ui
[20:09:21] <LEU> with min or not ?
[20:09:43] <LEU> simple or with min in ther name ?
[20:11:21] <jphase> hm? I like to keep .min.js in the name if it's minified, sure
[20:11:58] <LEU> for me still doesn't work
[20:12:07] <LEU> i have to include them in head or in body
[20:12:26] <jphase> css in the head, js before the </body> tag
[20:13:26] <LEU> nope still doesn't work
[20:13:31] <LEU> i'm going crazy
[20:13:41] <sacho> doesn't work is not an error
[20:13:43] <jphase> and you have no errors in your console?
[20:14:06] <mogaj> I am have a json object and using one of the data in that object am getting another json object how can add this second object to first set of object .... for example what i am trying to do is http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/u6g6A/ ... how can i achieve this in jquery?
[20:14:43] <LEU> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined jquery-ui-1.10.4.min.js:6 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[20:14:53] <sacho> mogaj, your question is very generic
[20:14:57] <jphase> LEU: include jQuery before jQuery UI
[20:15:37] <sacho> mogaj, I'd suggest going through a javascript tutorial if you didn't mean something more specific
[20:16:31] <LEU> what version copresed uncompresed ?
[20:16:56] <jphase> LEU: unless you're planning on modifying the core jQuery library, I'd suggest minified since it's smaller/faster
[20:17:37] <jphase> mogaj: you can nest any one of those objects or arrays inside of one of the properties or indices of another object or array. the arrays and objects are your oysters in js
[20:17:39] <LEU> 2x ?
[20:17:40] <mogaj> sacha ok
[20:18:02] <jphase> LEU: hm?
[20:18:14] <LEU> version of jQuery
[20:18:22] <jphase> get the latest stable, sure
[20:18:24] <jphase> 2.x
[20:18:33] <jphase> no sense in using moldy stuff imo
[20:21:02] <LEU> but i can't download it
[20:21:04] <LEU> wtf
[20:21:23] <LEU> here he goes me http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js
[20:25:40] <LEU> here we go
[20:26:29] <mogaj> jphase, sacho : i tried to do this but it is not working .... can you pls check http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/u6g6A/7/
[20:26:59] <LEU> what z-index should i put to be in top
[20:27:00] <LEU> ?
[20:28:28] <jphase> mogaj: you can't use d.push inside that, you'd need to reference the original object to push data onto it
[20:28:35] <jphase> either with $(this) or with data
[20:29:05] <jphase> LEU: well, that depends on what other elements are positioned absolute with z-index set.
[20:29:16] <jphase> "on top" would be relative to the "top most" z-index
[20:29:58] <LEU> yes they are absolute
[20:30:31] <jphase> bah, getting info out of you is like nailing jello to a tree
[20:30:43] <jphase> "on top" would be a number > than your highest z-index on the page
[20:31:02] <jphase> so if you have an element that's z-index: 99;   then "on top" would be a z-index of anything >= 100
[20:31:09] <jphase> and btw, this is officially unrelated to jQuery
[20:34:20] <LEU> i just had to put position absolute to it and work perfectly thanks a lot !
[20:40:32] <jphase> mogaj: perhaps what you're trying to do is modify the object as you iterate through it? if that's the case, you're probably looking for something similar to this: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/JGgML/
[21:12:33] <antlong> anyone know the name of the plugin that allows you to have a step by step tutorial attached to individual elements on a page?
[21:12:45] <antlong> like click this, then the next field shows the tooltip, etc
[21:15:56] <likeurboss> Qtip2 ith
[21:16:07] <eip56> #css
[21:16:08] <likeurboss> Check out qtip2
[21:17:03] <eip56> Foundation or Bootstrap your thoughts? Trying to pick one to use/learn
[21:17:10] <hives> hey, what browsers does not support @media responsive quries?
[21:18:47] <likeurboss> Each of them have its pros and cons
[21:19:45] <likeurboss> Search google "foundation vs bootstrap"  and try to figure out which one is better for your needs
[21:30:39] <__joshua___> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-mediaqueries
[21:30:43] <LEU> omg what is the selector for http://jsfiddle.net/ubx4t/2/ the <li> with ccccc as text i want to add some properties on it
[21:31:13] <__joshua___> li:contains('ccccc')
[21:31:45] <LEU> it's just one example i want to know the selector for it
[21:33:11] <__joshua___> $("li:contains('ccccc')")
[21:34:11] <LEU> did you saw my fiddle ?
[21:35:04] <__joshua___> just open it up.  what do you want?
[21:35:07] <LEU> i want to add more of them and i want to select all of them without giving each one a class
[21:35:42] <LEU> i want to know the selector for the most inner <li>
[21:35:46] <jphase> LEU: if you need your specific child li with ccccc then just add some selectors before __joshua___'s example
[21:36:17] <jphase> like:   $('li ul li:contains("ccccc")')
[21:36:23] <jphase> etc.
[21:36:42] <__joshua___> although you should probably add a class if you want to select for it
[21:36:42] <LEU> and what if i have 2 of them ?
[21:36:53] <jphase> it will match two of them if they both contain ccccc
[21:37:10] <jphase> yeah, it's better for performance to add a class
[21:37:13] <LEU> ofc they'll not
[21:37:37] <__joshua___> its not really about performance, its about readability/maintainability
[21:37:52] <jphase> oh, I thought contains selectors did some regex matching stuffs
[21:37:53] <LEU> can't i type something like $('ul li ul lu')
[21:38:12] <jphase> LEU: you can shy of "lu" that is
[21:38:20] <LEU> :))
[21:38:38] <LEU> li i mean sorry i tierd
[21:40:10] <LEU> i want to make that inner li with text cccc larger how can i do that without class or id
[21:40:21] <LEU> because i'll add many of them soon
[21:40:34] <jphase> LEU: just add a class and use CSS
[21:41:13] <LEU> so if i have 10 i have to put class = "xxx" for everyone ?
[21:42:06] <jphase> that'd be the best way, yeah
[21:42:22] <jphase> I mean, you *can* do it with jQuery, but people that think that's a better approach are silly
[21:42:23] <LEU> i tought is there a easy way to select all that childrens
[21:42:39] <jphase> well you can apply CSS to all children of a selector, sure
[21:42:52] <__joshua___> parent > directchildren
[21:43:10] <jphase> I guess I don't know what you're asking, you want all children of a particular menu item to be a larger font then?
[21:44:22] <jphase> like   li.yourclass li a { font-size: 1.9rem; }   or something?
[21:44:51] <LEU> http://jsfiddle.net/ubx4t/3/
[21:45:01] <LEU> here we go that was what  i was asking for
[21:48:00] <jphase> hmm, if you're just looking for all child <li> elements then perhaps you should just use   #selectmenu, #selectmenu li { width: 13em; }
[21:48:10] <jphase> then it would apply to sub-sub-sub items
[21:48:13] <jphase> etc.
[21:48:43] <jphase> in fact, you probably don't even need the #selectmenu by itself since the child li would push it out
[22:10:54] <nownot> any idea on https://gist.github.com/akatreyt/01192c37cb3547ef1e2b wond remove class online 19?
[22:14:17] <jphase> nownot: there's literally no way to know that without seeing the markup
[22:14:21] <jphase> can you make a fiddle?
[22:14:51] <jphase> also, if you say...  var btn = $(this)    then you can just use  btn.closest instead of $(btn).closest
[22:14:54] <nownot> jphase: no, this code is so jacked it would take me forever. am I using hte syntax correct?
[22:26:38] <ledestin> if I report a jQueryUI 1.10 bug for IE8, will it be fixed?
[22:27:49] <dllama> hey guys, can anyone please lend a hand with something.  Using typeahead & bloodhound, and am getting Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined … can't quiet track down where it is
[22:27:56] <dllama> or whats causing it rather.
[22:28:12] <dllama> i see that its getting results, not showing dropdown, so i'm thinking it might be related to views maybe?
[22:28:14] <jphase> ledestin: jQuery UI 1.10 still has support for IE8
[22:28:24] <ledestin> jphase: thanks
[22:29:58] <jphase> dllama: it's such a common error that usually what I do is include the non-minified versions of the scripts and then track it down that way
[22:30:38] <jphase> it could be anything really
[22:30:44] <dllama> such a pain
[22:31:28] <jphase> yeah, either a classname or value or data attribute or anything :\
[22:32:47] <dllama> hmm,
[22:33:23] <dllama> i dont see anywhere where i would be specifying a class name or anything to that effect
[22:34:17] <jphase> well once you include the non-minified version you'd want to grab the line number of the error and go from there
[22:34:40] <jphase> kinda sucky, usually I end up re-reading the docs of the library in question to make sure I didn't miss something
[22:36:08] <dllama> jphase: i dont think i'm using the minified versino
[22:36:30] <dllama> this is a rails app, so i gotta to through all the gems
[22:36:41] <jphase> bleh
[22:37:20] <dllama> yea using regular one
[22:37:23] <shoky> look at the error's stack trace
[22:37:40] <dllama> error comes from: length = elems.length,
[22:37:51] <dllama> which i'm thinking might be related to dropdowns not showing up?
[22:37:55] <shoky> in what function
[22:38:00] <dllama> thats in jquery directly
[22:38:00] <shoky> what file
[22:38:08] <dllama> jquery.js
[22:38:12] <shoky> which function
[22:38:13] <dllama> 505
[22:38:18] <dllama> map: function( elems, callback, arg ) {
[22:38:18] <dllama> 		var value,
[22:38:18] <dllama> 			i = 0,
[22:38:18] <dllama> 			length = elems.length,
[22:38:18] <dllama> 			isArray = isArraylike( elems ),
[22:38:19] <dllama> 			ret = [];
[22:38:29] <shoky> ok, what else is in the stack trace
[22:38:49] <dllama> remote: {
[22:38:49] <dllama>             url: '/tp_lenders.json?query=%QUERY',
[22:38:49] <dllama>             filter: function (lenders) {
[22:38:49] <dllama>               console.log(lenders);
[22:38:49] <dllama>                 return $.map(lenders.results, function (lender) {
[22:38:50] <dllama>                     return {
[22:38:50] <dllama>                         value: lender.name,
[22:38:51] <dllama>                         lender_id: lender.id
[22:38:51] <dllama>                     };
[22:38:52] <dllama>                 });
[22:38:52] <dllama>             }
[22:38:53] <dllama> complaint came from $.map()
[22:39:10] <shoky> this is your code?
[22:39:13] <dllama> yes
[22:39:27] <shoky> lenders.results is defined?
[22:39:43] <wa5ted_> dllama: never ever do that again
[22:39:56] <dllama> never post code?
[22:40:03] <wa5ted_> ever
[22:40:04] <wa5ted_> dllama: if you want help put it in a pastie
[22:40:04] <wa5ted_> never paste code on irc
[22:40:11] <dllama> sorry
[22:40:15] <dllama> i'll stick to gist
[22:40:17] <dllama> my mistake
[22:40:20] <wa5ted_> no no
[22:40:26] <dllama> gist is no good?
[22:40:33] <wa5ted_> dllama: paste here http://paste.ofcode.org/
[22:40:37] <dllama> understood
[22:40:37] <shoky> gist is fine
[22:40:37] <wa5ted_> or gist
[22:40:40] <wa5ted_> what ever
[22:40:49] <shoky> chill out, wa5ted_
[22:40:59] <dllama> shoky: u were right, i didn't even notice the results… way too late already
[22:41:14] <wa5ted_> shoky: you have no idea, once this guy pasted 100 lines of code, took 5 min before he got our first msg no to paste code
[22:41:16] <dllama> lenders.results didn't exist, removed it and its showing results.
[22:41:39] <shoky> wa5ted_ ok
[22:44:55] <nownot> how would I check if the closest class contains a class. not class = “foo bar” but <class a><class b/></class a> to check if class a contains class b
[22:46:04] <shoky> classes don't contain anything
[22:46:14] <jphase> nownot: your question is a bit confusing, but perhaps .closest('.closestclass').find('.childclass').length  ?
[22:46:22] <jphase> you mean an element with a child class?
[22:46:33] <nownot> jphase: yes
[22:46:58] <nownot> jphase: so if(btn.closest('.gw-q-wrap').find('spec-q').length != 0) ?
[22:47:19] <nownot> .gw-q-warp is otter class and spec-q is child
[22:47:22] <jphase> hard to say without seeing the markup, and != 0 is unnecessary, but yeah
[22:47:46] <jphase> spec-q would need to be .spec-q
[22:47:49] <jphase> if that's the class
[22:47:58] <nownot> yep, just got it to work. thanks!!
[22:55:38] <dllama> guys, thank you so much for the help, that got it working,  just 1 other question.  can i combine the displayKey ?
[22:55:58] <dllama> for instance, returning lender_name && lender_state, can i have the dispalyKey be lender_name + lender_state ?
[23:02:21] <dllama> nm about previous question.  turned out to be noticeably easier to do it via rails.  thanks for the help!!
