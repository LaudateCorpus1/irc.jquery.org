[00:00:24] <hydraidm801> if I get an html response back from the server how can I do a redirect in jquery?
[00:12:21] <kevireilly> hydraidm801: you can check the request headers for the application/html content-type and then do a window.location = 'http://url';
[00:13:10] <kevireilly> let me try that agian... check the response headers for text/html
[00:14:03] <hydraidm801> kevireilly: ah! good idea
[00:14:30] <hydraidm801> http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/
[00:14:33] <hydraidm801> :-(
[00:14:37] <hydraidm801> that won't work in production
[00:14:42] <kevireilly> probably not
[00:14:48] <hydraidm801> I'll check with #django
[00:15:24] <kevireilly> hydraidm801: commonly if you bind to all network interfaces, you can just replace 127.0.0.1 with the public or private IP
[00:15:38] <kevireilly> though probably want a 24/7 server in most instances
[00:16:29] <hydraidm801> I use event.preventDefault() in my jQuery. Is there a "resumeDefault" function?
[00:17:31] <hydraidm801> $(this).unbind('submit').submit()
[00:18:09] <kevireilly> hmm?
[00:18:40] <hydraidm801> thats how to resume a form submission
[00:18:48] <hydraidm801> I asked before I googled
[00:19:33] <jphase> hydraidm801: you can also use .off() similar to .on() to remove an event binding
[00:21:08] <hydraidm801> jphase: would that be best done in a .done() ?
[00:21:24] <hydraidm801> assuming its a $.get or $.post()
[00:21:49] <jphase> hydraidm801: well, assuming that you want to unbind your event from the return of some ajax request, sure I suppose
[00:22:14] <jphase> i.e. check the return from some get/post and determine whether or not to remove the event handler
[01:36:25] <Insolsence> Been a while since I used jQuery but had a quick question. I have a keydown event handler for a form field that updates a the text inside another tag. That works well. However, what doesn't work is setting it to the pre-input value (for eg. the form has been submitted, there was error and the field is still populated). How do I do that?/
[01:37:40] <Insolsence> I tried load and ready but that doesn't work. I know it can be done by writing a separate function that doesn't use the $(this) inside the keydown handler but I want to maximize code-reuse.
[01:40:22] <Insolsence> Figured it out. Could just use trigger :)

[07:24:43] <baako> hi guys. why cant i do something like this
[07:24:45] <baako>  $('iframe').css('display', 'none!important');
[07:25:08] <baako> added the "!important" doesnt seem to work but without it is does
[07:25:12] <baako> work
[07:28:02] * hellyeah HALP !
[07:28:15] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:30:57] <shoky> baako: should be 'none !important' but you hardly ever need !important
[07:32:22] <jsparks> hi is there a way to fire an ajax call only in a specific page without include the script on that page?
[07:53:49] <Hollusion> has return false; in the ajax success callback any effect on the complete callback?
[08:00:12] <shoky> Hollusion: returns from ajax callbacks don't have any effect on anything, iirc
[08:00:50] <shoky> unless you're using .then()
[08:16:07] <GrundeLL_> Hello, im working on a thing where i try to get the parameters of the url, and i want to say that if its not present in the url give it this value. for some reason i cant get it to work. https://jsfiddle.net/mqfhofet/1/
[08:22:57] <shoky> GrundeLL_: you're returning null , but then checking !== undefined
[08:23:14] <shoky> but null !== undefined
[08:23:47] <GrundeLL_> shoky: okay, so how do i return null?
[08:23:55] <GrundeLL_> sorry pretty new to working with this
[08:23:59] <shoky> GrundeLL_: hm? you're already returning null
[08:24:21] <GrundeLL_> so i need to check for null instad?
[08:24:40] <GrundeLL_> or?
[08:25:00] <shoky> that'd work
[08:25:24] <GrundeLL_> shoky: it doesnt...
[08:25:49] <shoky> GrundeLL_: without the typeof
[08:25:55] <shoky> GrundeLL_: but you can jst do something like this  https://jsfiddle.net/mqfhofet/2/
[08:27:11] <GrundeLL_> shoky: still doesn't give me 3...
[08:27:23] <shoky> GrundeLL_: er well since it's a number it should be more strict
[08:27:34] <shoky> GrundeLL_: the fiddle i just gave you gives 3
[08:28:53] <GrundeLL_> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/mqfhofet/4/ doesn't alert 3
[08:29:36] <shoky> GrundeLL_: because alert only takes one parameter. don't use alert
[08:29:54] <shoky> GrundeLL_: anyway since it's a number you should check null  https://jsfiddle.net/mqfhofet/3/
[08:31:13] <GrundeLL_> Okay.
[08:32:51] <shoky> (because doing if (!number)  would also be true for 0)
[08:35:31] <GrundeLL_> shoky: Okay :) sweet now it works
[08:35:33] <GrundeLL_> Thank you!
[08:43:51] <jerit> I'm getting "div.dialog is not a function" error when I click to create a new user, any ideas? http://pastebin.com/fYpqy1dP
[08:44:00] <user> yes jerit ?
[08:44:44] <jerit> user you've confused me
[08:47:41] <shoky> jerit: seems fine  http://jsbin.com/litoqoquwi/1/edit?html,output
[08:47:46] <shoky> jerit: but don't use onclick
[08:48:05] <hellyeah> hey
[08:48:07] <shoky> (use .on('click' in your js code)
[08:48:13] <hellyeah> hey can you check line 58-80 do i have any mistake about using map http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/7/
[08:48:50] <jerit> shoky, as an alternative, what about $("button").click(function () { } as an alternative?
[08:49:13] <hellyeah> alternative to what?
[08:49:20] <hellyeah> ah
[08:49:37] <hellyeah> on is wrapper i guess
[08:49:49] <hellyeah> on wrapper for click event
[08:49:53] <shoky> jerit: that's fine, it's just a shortcut for .on('click'
[08:50:46] <shoky> hellyeah: since you're calling jquery's .map (and not the native array .map) then if you want to get a regular array out of it you need to add .get() at the end
[08:51:05] <shoky> hellyeah: e.g.  var outputArray = $(...).map(...).get();
[08:52:48] <hellyeah> shoky: line 79 http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/8/
[08:53:12] <shoky> hellyeah: yes, you added it
[08:53:37] <hellyeah> okey
[08:53:46] <hellyeah> thanks for warning :)
[08:54:32] <hellyeah> so if i use jquery map i will have to add get()
[08:54:36] <hellyeah> okey understood
[08:55:58] <shoky> hellyeah: because jquery's map returns a jquery object/collection, in case you want to run jquery methods on it.
[08:56:35] <hellyeah> i want to return an array actually
[08:56:48] <shoky> hellyeah: right, that's why you need to add .get()
[08:57:10] <shoky> which gives you the raw array inside the jquery object
[08:57:20] <hellyeah> it returns jquery object now http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/10/
[08:57:40] <hellyeah> no it didnt give me array, jquery object instead
[08:57:55] <hellyeah> check that out
[08:58:08] <shoky> hellyeah: it's giving you a regular array
[08:58:35] <shoky> are you looking at the right log?
[09:00:05] <hellyeah> sorry youı are right
[09:02:06] <hellyeah> this array is expanded
[09:02:16] <hellyeah> but i just want to add last datepickers value
[09:02:26] <hellyeah> how can i reinitialize outputArray
[09:02:30] <hellyeah> is it possible?
[09:02:39] <shoky> reinitialize? what do you mean
[09:03:05] <hellyeah> when you create two datepickers you see arr(2), arr(2)
[09:03:13] <hellyeah> it is added to the tail
[09:03:30] <hellyeah> i dont want this i just want arr(2) to the value of last datepickers
[09:03:45] <shoky> then don't add all of them..?
[09:04:00] <shoky> why are you telling me what you want to do instead of doing it :)
[09:04:29] <ornerymoose> I’m looking to display multiple (30) videos on my site: I was using Vimeo’s widget ‘Hubnut’ https://vimeo.com/tools/widget but apparently this doesn’t support mobille. Anyone know of any decent jquery plugins that can do this? I’ve been searching around for a bit but most I’m finding only support single videos.
[09:04:35] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:04:44] <hellyeah> may be you can suggest smt to me :p
[09:05:02] <shoky> why should i? do you have a problem?
[09:05:11] <shoky> go do what you want to do, that's my suggestion
[09:26:01] <r00ster> Hi guys. Is there a simple way to select an element by type/class that’s the closest to the top of your browser window?
[09:26:55] <hellyeah> $('.smt').closest('table');
[09:26:57] <hellyeah> ?
[09:27:12] <shoky> i think he means visually closest ?
[09:27:39] <r00ster> So I.e. if there are 7 H2 headers visible in your browser window. I would like to select the one that’s the closest to the top of the window.
[09:27:52] <r00ster> Yes shoky
[09:29:14] <r00ster> I guess I can put them all in an array and use an each loop to check while scrolling, which element has the lowest scrollTop value.
[09:30:00] <shoky> r00ster: you can try  var topmostH2 = $('h2').get().sort(function(el1,el2) { return $(el1).offset().top - $(el2).offset().top; })[0]
[09:30:27] <shoky> then var $topmostH2 = $(topmostH2)  if you want it to be a jquery object
[09:30:35] <r00ster> Oh yes. That looks good.
[09:34:59] <shoky> r00ster oh sorry that won't work for scrolled content
[09:35:50] <shoky> but you can add in the scrollTop in the sort, i guess. though that's only good if they all share the same "scroll parent" or whatever
[09:37:40] <r00ster> Ehhhh, I see.
[09:43:43] <baako> hi guys i am trying to remove the style http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GodJgq

[09:52:08] <skyFlix> baako: Well … it does as far as I see it
[09:58:05] <shoky> jerit: as you can see in the jsbin, there is no error. maybe you have another error before it like it's not loading jquery-ui properly or something ?
[10:06:21] <Joel> given <a href="http://foo.bar">Hello</a> what selector would I have to write to match and href with a value of Hello?

[10:21:23] <hellyeah> wa5ted: are you available?
[10:21:36] <wa5ted> yh....
[10:22:05] <shoky> jerit: does that error happen on the initial call to .dialog too?  on page load, before you click the button /
[10:22:11] <hellyeah> :X
[10:22:31] <jerit> shoky yup
[10:22:32] <shoky> jerit: and btw if you call it initially then in later calls you need to call .dialog('open')
[10:23:41] <jerit> that is, yes, it happens on the initial call
[10:25:28] <shoky> jerit: and there is no error saying jquery-ui script wasn't loaded properly? you see it loading in the network tab?
[10:25:48] <shoky> jerit: oh
[10:26:13] <shoky> jerit: you're including jquery twice..
[10:27:15] <jerit> thats asp.net mvc for you...
[10:27:26] <jerit> I didn't think to comment out the jquery script reference :/ fml

[11:22:09] <Classic_Tech> can anyone help me with a javascript for a pdf file i'm am working on?

[11:23:00] <Joel> shoky, cool, thanks
[11:23:21] <eddiedean> Silly question. I have this php file that returns a number. The nomber is a percentage of a process run by the server. How can I retrieve the value and show it in real time? Regards.
[11:24:30] <shoky> eddiedean: you can do an ajax request to that php file and put the response in some element
[11:25:14] <Classic_Tech> i'm trying when some one select a work on a drop down it enables this code: var v1 = +getField("QTY1").value event.value= v1 * 0.3048;
[11:25:32] <eddiedean> shoky would the ajax request update itself the value or should I put some kind of timer, like 'every 1 sec execute this'?
[11:26:13] <shoky> eddiedean: it won't update itself. you should set a timer for the next request, after getting the response for the previous request,  with setTimeout
[11:26:44] <eddiedean> Ok shoky, thanks a lot :)
[11:26:45] <skyFlix_> Classic_Tech: can you show us a snippet?
[11:31:22] <Classic_Tech> var Foot = getElementByName ("Item_Dropdown1") [1].value if (Foot.value == "foot1") { var v1 = +getField ("QTY1").value event.value=v1 * 0.3048;}
[11:33:54] <shoky> Duder9999: you add it wherever you're initializing datatables with a call to  .dataTable({...options...})
[11:35:12] <Duder9999> shoky hi. Yeah I am lost. because the calls are in CSS that point to the jquery.datatables.min.js so do I just add that code to that css file?
[11:35:47] <shoky> Duder9999: huh? what does css have to do with this. you shouldn't add any code to css files :)
[11:37:19] <Duder9999> The Datatables jquery is applied to the table with CSS class
[11:37:33] <duch_kazatel> that's just a class.
[11:37:37] <duch_kazatel> it's used by CSS and JS.
[11:37:50] <duch_kazatel> you can target classes with JS.
[11:38:16] <Duder9999> so in JS I can say anything with X class apply this JS
[11:38:30] <duch_kazatel> yep.  if you're using jquery, it's pretty trivial.
[11:38:38] <Duder9999> right
[11:38:57] <Duder9999> in the jquery.datatables.min.css file, i see no code similar to that link
[11:39:08] <duch_kazatel> why are you looking at the css file?
[11:39:27] <Duder9999> isnt that where I would reference the class to the jquerr?
[11:39:37] <Duder9999> $('#example').dataTable( {     "order": [[ 0, 'asc' ], [ 1, 'asc' ]] } );
[11:39:47] <duch_kazatel> "reference the class to the jquery"?  huh?
[11:39:50] <duch_kazatel> none of that is jquery.
[11:39:54] <duch_kazatel> err, none of that is CSS< rather.
[11:39:56] <duch_kazatel> that's all JS.
[11:40:44] <Duder9999> ok. Thanks duch_kazatel for trying to help me out. The table that currently uses the DataTables functions has several classes applied to it.
[11:41:07] <duch_kazatel> right.
[11:41:13] <duch_kazatel> classes are used by both js and css.
[11:41:13] <Duder9999> no jquery in the actual html code... so those classes have to represent jquery, right?
[11:41:24] <duch_kazatel> they don't "represent" jquery or css.
[11:41:32] <duch_kazatel> they're classe.s  the css and js target those classes.
[11:41:41] <Duder9999> ok. sure. same thing.
[11:41:54] <Duder9999> so in the jquery, where do I traget those classes
[11:41:58] <Duder9999> target
[11:42:18] <duch_kazatel> $('.someSelectorHere'))
[11:42:25] <duch_kazatel> ignore the second )
[11:42:38] <duch_kazatel> that would be for a class.  jquery's selectors are like css selectors.
[11:42:38] <Duder9999> I have 2 files with DataTables  jquery.datatables.min.js and  jquery.datatables.min.css
[11:42:44] <duch_kazatel> you don't edit those.
[11:43:08] <duch_kazatel> you'd include your own js file in the page after the datatables file and put your code in there.
[11:44:51] <Duder9999> ok. but the existing code implemented for DataTables doesnt have that
[11:44:53] <duch_kazatel> and in that new js file, you'd put your code.
[11:44:58] <duch_kazatel> doesn't have what?
[11:45:09] <Duder9999> doesnt have an additional js file
[11:45:33] <duch_kazatel> traditionally, you put your code in an additional file and don't edit the original source.
[11:49:25] <Duder9999> ok. I think I am catching up.
[11:58:28] <Classic_Tech>   var Foot = getElementByName ("Item_Dropdown1") [1].value if (Foot.value == "foot1") { var v1 = +getField ("QTY1").value event.value=v1 * 0.3048;}
[11:59:46] <duch_kazatel> Classic_Tech have a question?
[11:59:58] <Classic_Tech> yea
[12:00:04] <duch_kazatel> and it is?
[12:00:24] <duch_kazatel> btw you'r ebasically doing if (getElementByName("Item_Dropdown1")[1].value.value) {}
[12:00:25] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:03:56] <duch_kazatel> aaaand back.
[12:04:10] <Classic_Tech> ok
[12:04:22] <piking_tim> getElementsByName
[12:07:29] <Classic_Tech> i'm just trying to get a word selected from a drop down on a pdf form and enable the this code : var v1 = +getField("QTY').value event.value= v1 * 0.3048
[12:08:17] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:08:41] <duch_kazatel> you need to convert that v1 to a number first.
[12:09:31] <Classic_Tech> ok
[12:09:40] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[12:15:34] <Classic_Tech> the v1  is a field that someone will add a number to and that number they added will be converted to  meters
[12:16:04] <duch_kazatel> so can you make a simple jsfiddle ooor...?
[12:16:33] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, since you're not really using jquery, maybe try ##javascript for more help?
[12:18:24] <skyFlix> Classic_Tech: then make sure its a number
[12:18:30] <skyFlix> as in integer or float
[12:19:03] <duch_kazatel> fwiw there's no such thing as "int" for "float" in js - there's only "Number"
[12:22:16] <Classic_Tech> https://jsfiddle.net/jeffreygumbs/9xq7r57n/1/#set-as-base
[12:23:50] <duch_kazatel> that's... not what i meant.
[12:23:51] <duch_kazatel> but ok.
[12:24:10] <duch_kazatel> v1 in that fiddle is going to be a string.
[12:24:18] <duch_kazatel> you need to convert it to a number.
[12:31:41] <skyFlix> Classic_Tech: Why not https://jsfiddle.net/seb5ajy6/
[12:36:16] <Classic_Tech> sorry i'm doing a lot of things at once
[12:36:33] <skyFlix> duch_kazatel: parseInt() is definitely INT related
[12:36:49] <duch_kazatel> skyFlix that... doesn't change my originaly point :)
[12:36:55] <duch_kazatel> there's only one number type in js.
[12:37:27] <duch_kazatel> you can use parseFloat and parseInt to get a number with or without a decimal, but otherwise you need just a number.
[12:38:06] <skyFlix> as in Number()
[12:38:22] <skyFlix> That would be Classic_Tech's solution then
[12:38:29] <duch_kazatel> err.
[12:38:29] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:38:31] <duch_kazatel> that's a constructor.
[12:38:38] <emilford> How can I append a callback to an element and still have the original callback triggered?
[12:38:43] <duch_kazatel> he SHOULD use parseFloat in his case.
[12:38:53] <duch_kazatel> emilford .on()
[12:40:31] <emilford> duch_kazatel: Okay...and that will allow me to append them one by one and they'll trigger in the order they're added?
[12:41:09] <emilford> duch_kazatel: I'll try it and see. :) Thanks
[12:41:43] <Classic_Tech> brb
[12:41:45] <duch_kazatel> if order is important, i'd find another way to manage that.
[12:42:16] <skyFlix> var number = "12.5"; will this me a number or a string?
[12:42:21] <duch_kazatel> string.
[12:43:26] <emilford> duch_kazatel: It's not critical so long as they both fire.
[12:43:35] <duch_kazatel> emilford they'll both fire then, yeah.
[12:43:44] <duch_kazatel> though I'd avoid binding multiple handlers if you can avoid it.
[12:43:57] <GJdan> I'm inside a $.each loop and I want to access the object my loop is inside.  I can't use 'this' because that's the current loop element or something
[12:44:15] <duch_kazatel> GJdan .bind() the callback to the parent scode.
[12:44:20] <guideX> can someone explain to me (again) why async: false isn't the coolest thing ever?
[12:44:24] <emilford> duch_kazatel: okay, let me find another way to do it then
[12:44:25] <guideX> because it sure seems like it
[12:44:27] <skyFlix> Since ("12.5" * .3048) returns 3.81 there doesnt need to be a conversion
[12:44:32] <duch_kazatel> $.each(function() {}.bind(this)); GJdan
[12:44:34] <guideX> ... in $.ajax
[12:44:48] <duch_kazatel> skyFlix that's relying on type coercion.
[12:44:50] <duch_kazatel> which is bad.
[12:44:59] <duch_kazatel> guideX it freezes the browser while the request runs.
[12:45:07] <guideX> yes but that's what I want
[12:45:17] <duch_kazatel> guideX you should never want that.
[12:45:20] <guideX> I want to loop through a few ajax requests,and block while I wait
[12:45:23] <duch_kazatel> use css to prevent page interaction instead.
[12:45:42] <guideX> not about page interaction, at the end I will window.location = "", but in the meantime, I wanna wait
[12:45:44] <GJdan> duch_kazatel: perfect, thanks :D
[12:46:12] <duch_kazatel> skyFlix try using + instead of * there and you'll see the problem.
[12:46:21] <skyFlix> true
[12:46:35] <guideX> I mean, if I window.location = "" BEFORE the last ajax is complete, then that's bad
[12:46:45] <duch_kazatel> guideX this sounds really strange, but ok.
[12:46:47] <guideX> if I async: false, than it functions like I want, I don't see the issue
[12:47:09] <duch_kazatel> guideX except you lock the browser.  which 99% of developers like to avoid.
[12:47:20] <taplar_busy> and users
[12:47:24] <guideX> duch_kazatel: the user is looking at a spinner during this time anyways though
[12:47:36] <user> yes agreed guideX
[12:47:42] <duch_kazatel> guideX look at my statement again :)
[12:47:44] <duch_kazatel> browser.
[12:48:02] <guideX> but, I don't want the user doing anything anyways during this time, I want them to wait
[12:48:04] <duch_kazatel> some browsers will fully lock, as in you're stopping the user from doing anything.
[12:48:10] <user> agreed me neither guideX
[12:48:19] <user> i think locking browsers is great duch_kazatel
[12:48:22] <guideX> I've tested it in ie, chrome, firefox, seems like I see expected behaviror
[12:48:26] <guideX> ok...
[12:48:29] <guideX> so how else might I do it?
[12:48:34] <guideX> not really seeing that
[12:48:37] <duch_kazatel> use CSS and put up an overlay.
[12:48:57] <guideX> the problem is, I have multiple things I want to do.. I don't want to do those things before the page loads
[12:49:01] <guideX> because I want the user to see a spinner
[12:49:07] <guideX> so I use ajax
[12:49:11] <guideX> but I must use multiple ajax calls
[12:49:12] <taplar_busy> your making it sound harder than it is
[12:49:15] <duch_kazatel> ^^^^
[12:49:17] <user> i dont want to see a spinner
[12:49:44] <guideX> it's not really that complicated, I just have a loop, for each file, I will do an ajax call
[12:50:16] <duch_kazatel> sure.  show overlay, when all the promises resolve, hide the overlay.
[12:50:18] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty simple./
[12:50:28] <taplar_busy> the issue is your trying to prevent further user interaction while the ajax are running.  an overlay will block mouse interactions with the page.  paired with bluring any focuses to prevent tabbing this works.  async false works too, but has the side effect of locking the browser
[12:50:39] <guideX> hrm, I do not understand promiss
[12:50:43] <guideX> I have looked at it though
[12:50:49] <duch_kazatel> they're easy.
[12:50:56] <duch_kazatel> you can create an array of ajax requests.
[12:51:03] <duch_kazatel> and when they're all done, do something.
[12:51:13] <guideX> that's what I want...
[12:51:38] <guideX> at the same time, I want them to happen in sequence though
[12:51:44] <guideX> proimiss they all happen at once?
[12:51:55] <guideX> I need them to happen just one, then another, then another etc
[12:52:00] <guideX> then I do something else
[12:52:01] <duch_kazatel> you could chain them in sequence if you want - do they actually rely on one another?
[12:52:19] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax().done(function() {$.ajax().done()}); etc.
[12:52:36] <duch_kazatel> you don't have to nest them like that, but you get the idea.
[12:52:54] <i-nik> Hi I am new and would like to contribute.Can someone help me get started??
[12:53:11] <duch_kazatel> i-nik check out http://contribute.jquery.org/
[12:53:22] <guideX> hrm, I'll give promiss another shot, last time I tried it, I didn't understand at all how to use it and gave up
[12:53:31] <guideX> it seems really complicated
[12:53:33] <skyFlix> i-nik: contribute to this channel or to jquery in general?
[12:53:35] <duch_kazatel> guideX it's really not.
[12:53:46] <mikejw> what silliness am I doing here? http://pastebin.com/uZS1XqKH
[12:53:50] <duch_kazatel> guideX in your case, it'll replace your success: calls.
[12:53:59] <skyFlix> i-nik: or contribute to my awesome new script ;)
[12:54:28] <i-nik> skyFlix I would like to contribut to this channel
[12:54:45] <duch_kazatel> irc.jquery.org
[12:55:07] <skyFlix> i-nik: well … you could wait for someone to post a question and help out ;)
[12:55:42] <Uhkis> even asking is contributing!
[12:55:47] <duch_kazatel> #boom
[12:56:11] <skyFlix> mikejw: could you do a fiddle and add some html?
[12:56:47] <duch_kazatel> mikejw what are you trying to do?
[12:57:10] <duch_kazatel> mikejw $images[i] gets you the raw DOM node - you can't use jquery methods on those.
[12:57:18] <duch_kazatel> you want $image.each(function() {})
[12:59:19] <mikejw> duch_kazatel: thanks I just created a wrapper array and pushed each object into it :)
[12:59:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:59:37] <duch_kazatel> don't use for on jquery objects.
[12:59:43] <duch_kazatel> sooo.... :)
[12:59:57] <duch_kazatel> in fact, don't use for at all ;)
[12:59:58] <Classic_Tech> back
[13:00:11] <mikejw> I wanted to create an index array so I can do image[i]..something
[13:00:18] <mikejw> *index
[13:00:27] <duch_kazatel> "index array"?  there's no other kind of array.
[13:00:31] <mikejw> **indexed
[13:00:38] <duch_kazatel> same thing.
[13:00:45] <duch_kazatel> image[i].something liiike...?
[13:00:50] <mikejw> of course.. sorry it's not php
[13:00:53] <duch_kazatel> becuase this sounds like a job for .map()
[13:01:08] <mikejw> most probably is
[13:01:20] <duch_kazatel> var myNeatArray $images.map(function() { return $(this).attr('src'); }).get)(;
[13:01:25] <duch_kazatel>  err var myNeatArray = $images.map(function() { return $(this).attr('src'); }).get)(;
[13:01:36] <Duvdevan> javascript is biblical
[13:01:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:01:55] <guideX> part of the problem with promis I think is, I don't see alot of straight forward samples on it
[13:01:56] <i-nik> skyFlix:how can I contribute to your script??
[13:01:57] <Classic_Tech> i post a example iamge on what i'm trying to do : http://postimg.org/image/t2sjxhp4j
[13:02:08] <guideX> I keep running across these really confusing code samples
[13:02:31] <mikejw> :D
[13:02:35] <duch_kazatel> guideX then let us help you.
[13:02:51] <guideX> for instance this, http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises--net-24135
[13:03:02] <duch_kazatel> guideX sure, so let us help you with your case.
[13:03:03] <guideX> I can't find my scenario, where I want to use $.ajax and wait for it
[13:03:09] <guideX> ok
[13:03:24] <duch_kazatel> spin up a bpaste or something with your code.
[13:04:18] <guideX> k
[13:04:20] <guideX> ok
[13:04:24] <duch_kazatel> there are a few different ways to handle your case.
[13:04:26] <guideX> i'll put my code how it works today
[13:04:41] <duch_kazatel> do a simplified example./
[13:04:46] <guideX> alright
[13:08:16] <guideX> http://pastebin.com/bV4Wy2HH
[13:08:44] <guideX> simplified, so some extra junk is missing, but this is the asnyc : false functionality which seems to work well
[13:09:17] <duch_kazatel> there's only one ajax call here.
[13:09:24] <guideX> yep
[13:09:27] <duch_kazatel> ...
[13:09:30] <guideX> I want to do just one over and over, then redirect
[13:09:35] <duch_kazatel> you said there are multiple ones?
[13:09:54] <duch_kazatel> you're skipping the part where you call $.ajax() multiple times./
[13:10:34] <guideX> well basically I call the "UploadJobFileItemCorrect" over and over until I did all tr's
[13:10:36] <exactp> Does anybody care to explain how I use the sorter function for this https://github.com/danielfarrell/bootstrap-combobox/blob/master/js/bootstrap-combobox.js
[13:10:43] <guideX> using an async: false $.ajax
[13:10:52] <guideX> so one happens, then another, then another etc
[13:10:56] <duch_kazatel> guideX "until i did all trs"?
[13:10:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:10:58] <exactp> I'm sorry not sorter, matcher
[13:11:00] <guideX> yep
[13:11:07] <guideX> basically
[13:11:16] <guideX> I don't want to do that on the server via an array also
[13:11:17] <duch_kazatel> guideX no context man, gotta show me what you eman.
[13:11:18] <duch_kazatel> *mean
[13:11:30] <exactp> matcher: function (item) { return ~item.toLowerCase().indexOf(this.query.toLowerCase()); }
[13:11:38] <duch_kazatel> exactp what are you asking?
[13:12:03] <duch_kazatel> also exactp there's a ##bootstrap that's actually better for this question.
[13:12:03] <exactp> how do I use the matcher function of this plugin https://github.com/danielfarrell/bootstrap-combobox/blob/master/js/bootstrap-combobox.js I can't find it in the docs at all
[13:12:11] <exactp> oh crap
[13:12:14] <exactp> I'm sorry
[13:12:18] <duch_kazatel> it's fine :)
[13:12:20] <guideX> hrm, let me try my paste again
[13:12:22] <guideX> one second
[13:12:26] <guideX> think I made a mistake or two
[13:12:37] <duch_kazatel> fwiw they probaby don't document it because they don't want you to use it exactp
[13:12:46] <duch_kazatel> guideX so none of these ajax calls rely on any others?
[13:12:55] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand why you need to do them in a particular sequence.
[13:13:04] <guideX> I want to stop if the server doesn't like it
[13:13:11] <guideX> I do'nt want to continue to the next if the last one is bad
[13:13:13] <duch_kazatel> doesn't like one of the calls?
[13:13:30] <guideX> yeahj, if the server returns failure, I want to do some other stuff
[13:13:33] <duch_kazatel> send an array of things to do and have the server toss back an error if it comes accross a bad one.
[13:13:33] <exactp> duch_kazatel, they explain what the function is in the docs - matcher: Custom function with one item argument that compares the item to the input. Defaults to matching on the query being a substring of the item, case insenstive
[13:13:47] <duch_kazatel> exactp yeah, hit their room then.
[13:14:27] <guideX> duch_kazatel: in this case, I don't want to send an array to the server, the requirement is tha tthe server takes one item at a time
[13:14:34] <guideX> most cases yes, i'll send an array
[13:14:41] <guideX> and then results, but this one is different
[13:15:06] <guideX> I guess that's the correc tway
[13:15:08] <duch_kazatel> guideX so i assume you don't have control over the server?  in that case, you can just .forEach over an array of calls to make and use .done() for the next index.
[13:15:43] <guideX> hrm ok
[13:16:13] <SmashingX> hey, does anybody know by any chance if there's an event that clears the contents for jqte editor?
[13:16:33] <duch_kazatel> SmashingX an event or a method?
[13:16:42] <SmashingX> anything
[13:16:52] <duch_kazatel> have you tried .val('') ?
[13:17:07] <SmashingX> mhh no
[13:17:10] <SmashingX> let me try it
[13:19:39] <exactp> duch_kazatel I think #bootstrap is dead lol
[13:19:44] <Andrew_> Hi hi
[13:19:53] <duch_kazatel> exactp doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[13:20:05] <exactp> ofc
[13:20:09] <duch_kazatel> exactp if you want help, maybe try making a fiddle?
[13:20:20] <duch_kazatel> somebody might have a some input for you.
[13:21:17] <exactp> I'm just gonna write my own it is okay
[13:21:18] <exactp> :)
[13:21:32] <Andrew_> i have a weird jquery reference error jquery not defined. searched around for some information on how to resolve the issue however ive never messed with jquery but dont have a problem doing the work if pointed int he right direction
[13:21:39] <duch_kazatel> hah, fair enough.  it's cool if you want help here, just sayin'.
[13:21:53] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ is your code before or after your jquery file?
[13:21:54] <Andrew_> can anyone help me? :) website is suppsnow.com
[13:21:57] <exactp> i know buddy i come to pay it forward al the time
[13:21:58] <exactp> :)
[13:22:12] <Andrew_> i have jquery loading first in the header
[13:22:15] <exactp> duch_kazatel sounds like you're calling jquery before it is defined
[13:22:28] <Classic_Tech> thank skyFlix for your help but That code did not work i don't know why adobe acrobat JavaScript is giving me problems
[13:22:41] <duch_kazatel> Classic_Tech ask in ##javascript at this point
[13:22:51] <exactp> Andrew_ sounds like you're calling jquery before it is defined
[13:23:39] <Andrew_> could very well be the possibility however would i just have to test the sort order of how im calling it in the head?
[13:23:42] <Classic_Tech> ok
[13:23:49] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_...
[13:24:03] <duch_kazatel> <--<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.suppsnow.com/skin/frontend/suppsnow/default/js/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>--> remove the <-- --> around that tag.
[13:24:43] <duch_kazatel> also, you have app.js included twice.
[13:24:52] <duch_kazatel> one comes before jquery.
[13:25:12] <duch_kazatel> clean up your includes so there's one block in the correct order.
[13:25:23] <SmashingX> duch_kazatel: sorry man I'm a newbie on this, this is my jqte: http://pastebin.com/4EttF2RX
[13:25:35] <SmashingX> how can I select it and apply that method .val('')
[13:25:53] <duch_kazatel> SmashingX give it your own class and select that.
[13:26:19] <SmashingX> so I can't select it like that?
[13:26:29] <duch_kazatel> SmashingX you can, but those classes are generic.
[13:26:38] <duch_kazatel> unless you really don't have a choice.
[13:26:50] <duch_kazatel> you could also select a parent element and use .find() to get that textarea.
[13:26:55] <SmashingX> in that case how can I select it and clear it?
[13:26:56] <Andrew_> ok i will clean it up
[13:27:10] <duch_kazatel> SmashingX $('textarea').val() for instance.
[13:27:13] <duch_kazatel> like any other css selector.
[13:34:31] <hellyeah> hey
[13:35:20] <duch_kazatel> hello.
[13:36:00] <cmoneylulz> for some reason i cant seem to select content that has been loaded via ajax what am I doing wrong?
[13:36:17] <duch_kazatel> cmoneylulz show us what you're trying to do.
[13:36:23] <duch_kazatel> could be one of a few thiongs.
[13:36:26] <duch_kazatel> *things
[13:36:28] <cmoneylulz> one sec ill put together a fiddle
[13:36:57] <Uhkis> my money's on not doing $(data)
[13:45:49] <seemikehack> Hey all. I'm trying to figure out how to use a selector to filter the results that get selected by the .next() function: http://codepen.io/seemikehack/pen/RryPJV
[13:46:17] <Andrew_> duch_kazatel i reordered everything and its still not workin
[13:46:19] <Andrew_> any ideas?
[13:46:34] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ site linka gain?
[13:46:59] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack you know that .next() gets just the next element?  if you use a filter of some kind, it still only gets that element.
[13:47:05] <Andrew_> suppsnow.com
[13:48:01] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ your page source has app.js on line 57 and then you load jquery on line 107
[13:48:18] <duch_kazatel> so you haven't reordered anything :)
[13:48:28] <Andrew_> argh brb
[13:48:55] <islalobo> Does laravel generate a login token upon login? If so, how can I access that token?
[13:49:06] <duch_kazatel> islalobo wrong channel?
[13:49:13] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:49:14] <islalobo> Oh no! Thank you!
[13:49:16] <Andrew_> i see whats going on im not making the changes in the right spot fml
[13:49:23] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ ;)
[13:50:23] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, I suppose I made the assumption that it would select the next element meeting the criteria of the selector. So basically I'm just going to have to do some manual filtering.
[13:50:53] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack yep.
[13:50:54] <Andrew_> im gonna look in a few spots but im currently in the wrong folder for sure haha
[13:52:11] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, "only if it matches the selector" is what the docs say, I must just have skimmed and not paid close enough attention :) thanks for the tip!
[13:52:20] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack yep :)
[13:56:02] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, nextAll(filter).first() works: http://codepen.io/seemikehack/pen/RryPJV?editors=0010
[13:57:10] <pmercado> Hi!, how to check if textareas (a bunch of textareas) are empty, without any text ?
[13:57:35] <pmercado> $('#my_textarea').val() != ""  work fine for one textarea
[13:57:38] <Andrew_> duch still getting this error
[13:57:50] <duch_kazatel> pmercado you can only select one element with that ID.
[13:57:53] <pmercado> is there a way to check a bunch of them? $(textarea).something
[13:57:54] <Andrew_> i corrected the order
[13:57:56] <duch_kazatel> pmercado you could use .filter().length
[13:58:01] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ link again?
[13:58:07] <Andrew_> suppsnow.com
[13:58:23] <duch_kazatel> if i see the same issue...
[13:58:29] <duch_kazatel> dude
[13:58:32] <duch_kazatel> same thing
[13:58:33] <Andrew_> ?
[13:58:35] <Andrew_> NOOOOOO
[13:58:37] <duch_kazatel> jquery MUST come before app.js
[13:58:53] <Andrew_> damnit! i fail
[13:59:00] <pmercado> duch_kazatel: something like: $('textarea').filter(':empty') ???
[13:59:09] <duch_kazatel> open page source in your browser andrew9183
[13:59:11] <duch_kazatel> err, Andrew_
[13:59:12] <duch_kazatel> check there
[13:59:43] <Andrew_> ok
[13:59:45] <duch_kazatel> pmercado or use a function - .filter(function() { return !$(this).val()}).length
[14:00:00] <pmercado> oh thanks :)
[14:00:14] <Andrew_> you are the man
[14:00:19] <Andrew_> thank you so much
[14:00:23] <duch_kazatel> deffo mang.
[14:00:31] <duch_kazatel> just check the page source instead ;)
[14:10:34] <IceBerg> I am using jQuery and php to create a dynamic page that allows editing of data in a database.  When an option is selected I I alter the contents of a div modal with dew data from a php call but it seems that onclick callback handlers do not apply to the new content. Is there something I am doing wrong or another way to do this without a post/page reload? The function I use to load the new content into the div is this:  $.get($myurl, function(data)
[14:10:42] <duch_kazatel> that cut off.
[14:10:55] <duch_kazatel> and you want event delegation.
[14:11:08] <IceBerg> where did it cut off?
[14:11:14] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't mater :)
[14:11:19] <IceBerg> ok
[14:11:46] <IceBerg> looking up event del
[14:11:55] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:12:49] <duch_kazatel> also http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:13:58] <Andrew_> so anytime jquery is having that issue it is because it isnt called first correct?
[14:14:18] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ that just means the jquery object doesn't exist.
[14:14:36] <duch_kazatel> which means the file isn't loading before code trying to use it.  the jquery file could be 404ing for instance.
[14:14:37] <BigBear> I'm studying some javascript/jquery code and I am wondering how to modify it to return a different pattern of tags to the browser. Line 896 in the attached github code looks most interesting to me. https://github.com/szabyg/annotate.js/blob/gh-pages/lib/annotate.js
[14:14:40] <duch_kazatel> or it's in noconflict mode.
[14:15:12] <duch_kazatel> BigBear what's your question?
[14:15:35] <BigBear> I want somethiing like <span vocab="http://schema.org/"><span property="schema:comment" resource="http://localhost/iksce/?q=node/10#Austria1"></span><span resource="http://localhost/iksce/?q=node/10#Austria1"><a property="schema:name" rel="schema:SameAs" aria-disabled="false" href="http://localhost/iksce/?q=node/15" class="entity place Place acknowledged">Austria</a></span> instead of what is there.
[14:15:42] <Andrew_> ah gotchya thanks again duch
[14:16:00] <duch_kazatel> BigBear you realize that file is like 2,000 lines right?
[14:16:15] <BigBear>  newElement = $("<a href='" + entityUri + "'            resource='" + entityUri + "'            rel='" + rel + "'            class='" + entityClass + "'>" + entityHtml + "</a>")
[14:16:26] <duch_kazatel> what is your specific question?
[14:16:28] <BigBear> unfortunately...
[14:16:53] <BigBear> how do I get jquery to replace a string with arbitary html
[14:17:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:17:19] <IceBerg> I think I'm misunderstanding something. in my script I have this:   $('#users').on('click', 'tr', function(){     how do I tell the new content to trigger that? Something about the docs isnt clicking in my head, osrry.
[14:17:37] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg you don't - it doesn't need to trigger again.
[14:17:38] <gambl0re> anyone use webpack?
[14:17:43] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg is #users apart of what's getting replaced?
[14:18:39] <IceBerg> #users is a table and the contents of the table are being created dynamically
[14:18:51] <BigBear> sorry...is there at least some way I can print that newElement varibale to the browser or the cli?
[14:19:10] <duch_kazatel> BigBear you have developer tools - fixingthesejquery.com gives you a great rundown on how to use them :)
[14:19:20] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg but that element isn't apart of what's getting replaced?
[14:19:32] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg because it sounds like it is.
[14:19:34] <IceBerg> no
[14:20:00] <duch_kazatel> is that handler even binding then?
[14:20:03] <IceBerg> wait, maybe it is
[14:20:07] <duch_kazatel> heh
[14:20:43] <IceBerg> ok, can I just write into the table and not the div the same way I am writing to the div?
[14:20:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:21:15] <BigBear> thanks duch_kazatel'
[14:21:30] <duch_kazatel> you mean your ajax update logic?  you should be able to - just make sure you're appending the correct stuff.
[14:22:34] <IceBerg> $.get($myurl, function(data){ $("#userList").html(data); });  <— that is rewriting the contents of the div, if I change the directive to be the id of the table will that work?
[14:22:53] <duch_kazatel> IceBerg lol it's not a "directive" and i have no idea what your data looks like.
[14:22:59] <duch_kazatel> you'd need to update that part as well.
[14:23:05] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you can just bind to #usersList instead.
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> which is what i'd do.
[14:24:56] <IceBerg> that works! thanks, I haven't worked with websites in 10 years so I'm rusty to say the least.
[14:25:06] <duch_kazatel> that's fine :)
[14:25:26] <duch_kazatel> 10 years is how long jquery's existed - things have changed quite a bit.
[14:25:34] <halindrome> Silly question... given a dom reference $foo which is an element within a 'dd' element.  What's the most sensible way to refer to a dfn element within the dd's associated dt element?
[14:26:01] <duch_kazatel> halindrome show us markup in a fiddle.
[14:26:10] <duch_kazatel> descriptions like that are confusing - we can't see what's in your head :)
[14:26:44] <IceBerg> Yea I knew about jquery when I left web design and thats why I opted to use it when this project came as I didn't want to reinvent a billion wheels.
[14:26:51] <duch_kazatel> :)
[14:27:25] <hellyeah> hey
[14:27:43] <IceBerg> I owe you a pint for your patience, now this project is 90% done.
[14:27:49] <duch_kazatel> nah.  you're been awesome.
[14:28:16] <duch_kazatel> *you've
[14:29:38] <halindrome> duch_kazatel: https://jsfiddle.net/halindrome/6p0sbh98/#&togetherjs=9aKbLxF829
[14:29:49] * halindrome hopes I did that right
[14:30:09] <duch_kazatel> you can just hit "update" and share out that link.
[14:30:12] <duch_kazatel> instead of using togetherjs.
[14:30:27] <halindrome> cool
[14:30:49] <duch_kazatel> halindrome so which element do you have in a var?
[14:31:03] <halindrome> the 'a' within the dd.
[14:31:18] <duch_kazatel> and which did you want?
[14:31:38] <halindrome> so I was trying something like $foo.closest('dd').prev('dt').$("#something")
[14:31:44] <halindrome> I want a refernce to #something
[14:32:03] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:32:04] <duch_kazatel> that's silly.
[14:32:10] <duch_kazatel> ID's are unique.
[14:32:15] <duch_kazatel> $('#something') is all you need.
[14:32:28] <halindrome> this is a generic method that will find hundreds of #somethings in a list of definitions
[14:32:33] <duch_kazatel> you cannot have those.
[14:32:46] <duch_kazatel> you cannot use an ID more than once on a page.
[14:32:52] <halindrome> sorry not literal #something.  each ID is unique in the page
[14:32:59] <duch_kazatel> right, but they're unique.
[14:33:07] <duch_kazatel> and they're IDs.
[14:33:18] <halindrome> but unknown to this method.  I need to FIND the dfn element and then extract its ID
[14:33:24] <duch_kazatel> ah, okay.
[14:33:28] <duch_kazatel> that makes much more sense.
[14:33:37] <halindrome> yeah - my snippet above was stupid. sorry.
[14:33:51] <halindrome> $foo.closest('dd').prev('dt').$("dfn") is what I meant
[14:34:05] <duch_kazatel> make it easier on yourself.
[14:34:10] <duch_kazatel> $('.foo').closest('dl').find('dfn');
[14:35:16] <halindrome> hmm... but there are hundreds of 'dfn' elements and I need the one immediately before the current <a> that I am looking at
[14:35:43] <duch_kazatel> update your fiddle with more markup then.
[14:35:52] <duch_kazatel> make a more indicative example :)
[14:35:57] <halindrome> on it
[14:36:17] <duch_kazatel> rad
[14:37:37] <halindrome> https://jsfiddle.net/halindrome/6p0sbh98/2/
[14:38:32] <halindrome> so if $foo is a reference to the <a> in the third dd element, I need to find the dfn in the third dt element (the one with id something3)
[14:38:36] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:38:38] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[14:39:25] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6p0sbh98/3/
[14:39:28] <duch_kazatel> you were close before.
[14:39:34] <duch_kazatel> there's no .$ method
[14:39:37] <duch_kazatel> you meant .find()
[14:40:10] <halindrome> doh!  thanks
[14:41:24] <halindrome> this is actually an interesting problem.  Given an automaticlaly included glossary in a document, only keep in the glossary terms that are referenced elsewhere in the document (or terms that those terms reference).
[14:42:50] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:43:36] <halindrome> say you were working on a family of documents.  they all use some common terms.  So you define the terms in an external file (glossary.html).
[14:43:44] <duch_kazatel> slow down.
[14:44:14] <duch_kazatel> are you asking a question?  and if so, how are you tying together a term with its definition?
[14:44:38] <juslintek> Hi, can someone explain http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5097191/ajax-context-option responses 2nd option more in detail?
[14:44:48] <juslintek> So can I pass in context multiple variables?
[14:44:51] <halindrome> no - I was just explaining what I am working on 'cause I thought it was interesting.  Not important.  THanks again for your help!
[14:45:00] <juslintek> Because I don't want to repeat same actions in callback
[14:45:00] <taplar_busy> lol
[14:45:01] <duch_kazatel> halindrome aaaah alright :) no big.
[14:45:10] <juslintek> as I did before it, why not pass the variable?
[14:45:24] <duch_kazatel> juslintek what's your specific question?
[14:46:00] <juslintek> How can I pass multiple variables via $.ajax context option, and if I can, how to select them in callback?
[14:46:13] <juslintek> I know how to pass this
[14:47:08] <duch_kazatel> juslintek why do you want multiple variables in there?
[14:47:13] <juslintek> I don't know how to pass more then this. That json thing in context in stackoverflow thread, makes me think that I've made a lot of scripts dirty.
[14:47:29] <duch_kazatel> i think you're confused about what the context is for.
[14:47:35] <duch_kazatel> why are you trying to change it?
[14:47:39] <juslintek> duch_kazatel, because I don't want to select again same form to get dog_id or something
[14:48:02] <duch_kazatel> so i think you're confused about how function context works.
[14:48:07] <duch_kazatel> you can't bind the callback to multiple contexts.
[14:48:15] <duch_kazatel> your this can only reference one object.
[14:48:27] <juslintek> duch I've I create a variable before ajax call is it valid in callback?
[14:48:40] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:48:46] <duch_kazatel> as long as your in scope, sure?
[14:49:03] <duch_kazatel> you should be storing things like IDs in vars and then using those vars.
[14:49:19] <duch_kazatel> in fact, you should store anything static that you're using.
[14:50:24] <juslintek> dog_id = 12; $.post(some_url, { dumb_trigger: true }, function(data){ alert("My dogs name is"+data.dogs[dog_id]); } );
[14:50:28] <juslintek> Would that work?
[14:50:43] <duch_kazatel> yes, though that doesn't have a var in front of it.
[14:50:51] <juslintek> duch its not strict
[14:50:57] <duch_kazatel> doesn't matter.
[14:51:03] <duch_kazatel> global vars are bad.
[14:51:05] <juslintek> Okay I'll add it.
[14:51:07] <duch_kazatel> big code smell.
[14:51:25] <juslintek> duch, so how do I pass that dog_id to make small code?
[14:51:34] <duch_kazatel> "I don't know how to pass more then this. That json thing in context in stackoverflow thread, makes me think that I've made a lot of scripts dirty." - if you're worried about this then you need to be worried about valid code in general.
[14:51:38] <duch_kazatel> and what do you mean "small code"?
[14:52:07] <juslintek> I mean !big_code
[14:52:38] <duch_kazatel> i don't see any reference to big_code
[14:52:57] <juslintek> ! = is antonym
[14:53:07] <juslintek> !true = false
[14:53:08] <duch_kazatel> ...
[14:53:15] <duch_kazatel> i'm aware of how do code - what is "big_code"?
[14:53:22] <duch_kazatel> are you talking about a variable?
[14:53:25] <juslintek> Something that is not small :-D
[14:53:27] <duch_kazatel> or are you asking how to make this code more terse?
[14:53:41] <juslintek> vocabulary needed for word terse.
[14:54:04] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to make the example you provided shorter?
[14:54:14] <juslintek> duch, yeah I mena terse
[14:54:17] <juslintek> mean*
[14:54:34] <duch_kazatel> this is about as terse as you'll get.
[14:55:01] <juslintek> And you as well mentioned that you smell big code. So I wanted to know more. So I asked how not to make big code and make small one instead? Should I continue in more detail?
[14:55:15] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i said.
[14:55:41] <duch_kazatel> "big code smell" was more like "a lot of code smell" - like, a lot of bad habits.
[14:56:07] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to make the code smaller.
[14:56:14] <juslintek> oh so big was big smell for bad code.
[14:56:18] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[14:56:21] <jsparks> how can I get data-id=“value” from $(this’).closest(’tr’) ?
[14:56:25] <duch_kazatel> you need to fix some bad habits - like not using var.
[14:56:30] <duch_kazatel> jsparks .data('id')
[14:56:43] <juslintek> duch, I'm using vars. because my phpstorm tells me to lol :-D
[14:56:51] <duch_kazatel> good
[14:57:25] <juslintek> So question persists. Can I pass that dog_id to success?
[14:57:31] <Andrew_> hola
[14:57:33] <jsparks> duch, you mean after $(this).closest(‘tr’).data(‘id’) ? if so I’m getting undefined…
[14:57:35] <duch_kazatel> not the way you want to juslintek
[14:57:35] <Andrew_> back again with a new problem haha
[14:57:38] <duch_kazatel> just do what you're doing there.
[14:57:42] <duch_kazatel> jsparks yep.
[14:57:47] <duch_kazatel> jsparks if so, make a fiddle.
[14:57:56] <jsparks> duch cool
[14:57:57] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, not .attr('id')?
[14:57:57] <juslintek> duch, so how would you pass it?
[14:58:06] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack do you want the data-id or the id
[14:58:11] <duch_kazatel> juslintek the way you did in that example.
[14:58:21] <juslintek> duch, okay :D
[14:58:25] <duch_kazatel> you don't "pass" it unless you abstract out that function.
[14:58:32] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, just noticed his example, sorry :)
[14:58:41] <Andrew_> duch any ideas why my minicart doesnt work on suppsnow.com?
[14:58:51] <juslintek> duch, how to "abstract out" that function?
[14:58:53] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ hire a developer.
[14:59:27] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, we should pay people like you :)
[14:59:53] <Andrew_> i would pay seemikehack
[15:00:03] <Andrew_> i would pay duch seemikehack* haha
[15:00:08] <duch_kazatel> not the right place for that ;0
[15:00:17] <juslintek> I would brainpick till I would learn it myself :-D
[15:00:31] <duch_kazatel> juslintek https://bpaste.net/show/8c0266336cdd
[15:00:34] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, I was just teasing you, mostly, I know how this channel feels about that.
[15:00:39] <duch_kazatel> juslintek otherwise, stop worrying about it.
[15:00:46] <duch_kazatel> juslintek you're not going to get what you want.
[15:00:55] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack but Andrew_ doesn't ;)
[15:01:02] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, good point.
[15:01:11] <duch_kazatel> Andrew_ sounds like you need to hire a developer.  i'd really suggest looking for one and getting help.
[15:01:16] <duch_kazatel> good luck folks, i'm out for lunch.
[15:01:52] <juslintek> duch_kazatel, well I will brainpick later on javascript and will create custom ajax :-D
[15:03:51] <Andrew_> i answered my own question i gotta stop buggin out when i fix one thing and another thing goes wrong
[15:04:05] <Andrew_> appreciate yall not blowin up on me thanks
[15:05:12] <seemikehack> Andrew_, everyone starts somewhere :)
[15:05:35] <Andrew_> this is true
[15:05:36] <juslintek> duch, can I ask how to delegate to make function work and select changed nodes on ajaxed content?
[15:05:56] <juslintek> So I wouldn't need to reinit function on callback
[15:06:11] <seemikehack> juslintek, he left, but it sounds like what you're looking for is a delegated listener, using .on()
[15:06:20] <juslintek> As well on delegate do I have to use $(document)?
[15:06:31] <seemikehack> juslintek, something like $(document).on(event, selector, callback);
[15:06:57] <seemikehack> juslintek, or body, or wherever the dynamic content will live.
[15:07:01] <juslintek> seemikehack, is it nescessary to use document?
[15:07:34] <juslintek> So I have to stick to unchanging element.
[15:07:49] <juslintek> I mean glue it to unchanging element.
[15:07:52] <seemikehack> juslintek, yes, something that will always be in the DOM.
[15:07:57] <seemikehack> juslintek, correct.
[15:08:37] <juslintek> seemikehack, thanx, now I'm going to write smart script without too many reninits :-D
[15:08:55] <juslintek> Now I'm reniniting every function on callback and I think its not performance friendly
[15:09:02] <seemikehack> juslintek, for future reference, when you register a delegated listener, remember to deregister it when you no longer need it, or else you wind up with functions looking for things that don't exist, or multiple registrations.
[15:10:31] <juslintek> seemikehack, when exactly should I deregister it, like should I read on page name?
[15:13:01] <seemikehack> juslintek, if the script that registers the delegated listener only ever runs on page load, then you don't have to worry about it. It's just something to be mindful of when using delegated listeners in general.
[15:14:02] <taplar_busy> ideally you should scope down your delegate bindings so not everything is filtering through them
[15:14:11] <taplar_busy> unbinding shouldn't be an issue
[15:15:22] <juslintek> taplar_busy, oh yeah, I'm always telling the specific select like ID or an element. :-)
[15:15:32] <juslintek> of*
[15:16:18] <taplar_busy> not that scope
[15:16:30] <taplar_busy> if you can bind closer to the element, not use document or body, it is better
[15:17:58] <jsparks> duch it is solved my bad changed data suffix :(
[15:18:37] <jsparks> jquery sellector would never work
[15:19:02] <taplar_busy> what was the issue?
[15:37:52] <DragonPunch> in jquery .. how do it urn json data .. intno a string for post submission ..
[15:40:51] <taplar_busy> JSON.stringify(object)
[16:09:57] <dewp> hey guys. I think I have a very basic problem but with googleing the term I'd suspect I do not find the solution. The problem is described here: http://pastebin.com/s1SKXHfw
[16:10:35] <dewp> (my return is not in scope and I dont know how to fix it)
[16:11:01] <shoky> dewp: you can't return stuff from ajax callbacks. do what you want inside the callback
[16:11:13] <dewp> ugh ...
[16:11:18] <dewp> :-)
[16:11:28] <dewp> so .. back to global variables?
[16:11:37] <shoky> nope
[16:11:46] <shoky> just do stuff in callbacks :)
[16:12:05] <dewp> thats... to be honest a total new way of thinking
[16:12:07] <shoky> you might want to use the promises API
[16:12:10] <shoky> e.g.
[16:12:10] <dewp> sure
[16:12:19] <shoky> function getStartTime() { return $.get(...); }
[16:12:25] <shoky> var request = getStartTime();
[16:12:26] <shoky> ...
[16:12:56] <shoky> request.done(function(data) { ... })
[16:13:06] <shoky> or actually since you want to transform the data,
[16:13:10] <shoky> you can do:
[16:13:56] <shoky> function getStartTime() { return $.get(...).then(function(res) { var startTime.... ...;  return startTime; }); }
[16:14:00] <shoky> var request = getStartTime();
[16:14:02] <shoky> ...
[16:14:23] <shoky> request.done(function(startTime) { console.log('ajax is done and startTime is:', startTime)  })
[16:14:35] <shoky> dewp ^
[16:14:53] <dewp> this is a really great explanation. I googled this for hours but not with the right keywords
[16:15:10] <dewp> glad you immediately understood my problem. I totally got the solution!
[16:15:13] <taplar_busy> did you look at the $.get docs?
[16:15:17] <shoky> awesome dewp
[16:15:37] <dewp> taplar_busy, yes, that was why I thought putting it in success callback would be fine
[16:16:13] <dewp> but as it might happen in the beginning I could have misunderstood stuff
[16:16:57] <taplar_busy> you can stick it in the success
[16:17:06] <taplar_busy> if success fires, then done() will as well
[16:17:19] <shoky> and then() as well, which allows you to transform the data
[16:17:56] <shoky> so it's important to use .then instead of .done   in the place i used it
[16:18:12] <shoky> cause returning from a .done callback doesn't do anything
[16:18:24] <dewp> sure... cause its... done :)
[16:18:35] <shoky> heh
[16:25:18] <shoky> dewp btw if you use $.getJSON instead of $.get then you won't need the JSON.parse.  (also wont need it if your server responds with the correct json Content-Type header)
[16:28:38] <YamakasY> someone willing to check this out ? My targetDomainname is shown before the slide is done, it works for the rest perfectly but I would like to slide/hide and than show the new domainname http://pastebin.com/pYrxWAVf
[16:38:03] <YamakasY> no guru around ?
[16:45:06] <taplar_busy> YamakasY: you got some thing weird going on
[16:45:46] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/ line 29
[16:46:01] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: et me check
[16:46:14] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: I'm already happy I made this :D
[16:46:39] <taplar_busy> your giving the animate an empty success callback and afterwards putting logic in a random {} block
[16:46:39] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: what is wrong there ?
[16:47:00] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: mhh
[16:47:14] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: that is dirty ?
[16:47:32] <taplar_busy> if you want that logic to wait until the animate finishes, how would that work? :)
[16:47:42] <YamakasY> not
[16:48:07] <YamakasY> my previous single version without the if in the function does work ok, so
[16:48:09] <YamakasY> my bad :)
[16:48:12] <YamakasY> that goes wrong than
[16:48:15] <YamakasY> how to fix ?
[16:48:42] <taplar_busy> anything that should wait until the animate finishes should go in that parameter that is the function
[16:49:47] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: ok, I don't understand
[16:49:50] <jangoh> //div[@class='group'][0][div[@class='tt' and text()='HSDPA:']]/div/img/@src
[16:50:18] <jangoh> trying to select 1st occurance of class 'group'
[16:50:25] <taplar_busy> YamakasY: http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[16:50:33] <jangoh> anyone familiar with xquery?
[16:50:37] <taplar_busy> the method you give it is executed once the animate is finished
[16:51:25] <taplar_busy> also it's optional, so you giving it an empty function is unnecessary
[16:51:32] <taplar_busy> unless you need it
[16:51:40] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: is, but, erm... ok but I'm confused, overall it looks good
[16:55:13] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: so remove those functions ?
[16:56:13] <taplar_busy> are you not wanting whats in the {} afterwards to wait until the animate is done?  thought that's what you were saying
[17:02:04] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: mhh, ok again, I might be unclear
[17:02:36] <YamakasY> I have a text(), I need to slide it away, show the new one and slide it in again
[17:03:01] <YamakasY> so foo -> unvisible -> bar -> visible
[17:13:08] <taplar_busy> so here it's cleaned up a bit https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/1/
[17:13:18] <taplar_busy> none of the animates are waiting on anything
[17:16:42] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: kewl let me check
[17:17:14] <taplar_busy> so if you want parts to wait on other parts, you'll have to change it to do that
[17:19:48] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: yeah now it still changed the .text first and than slides
[17:20:00] <taplar_busy> right, i just cleaned it up.  no changes
[17:20:23] <YamakasY> ok, so now how am I going to let it wait ?
[17:20:34] <taplar_busy> first define what should wait on what
[17:21:12] <YamakasY> to the side is on 0 and than set the .text()
[17:21:21] <YamakasY> *slide
[17:21:27] <YamakasY> so sie, first part
[17:21:31] <YamakasY> *size
[17:21:41] <taplar_busy> ok, so the part that changes the text should wait on the slide to 0
[17:21:50] <YamakasY> yes
[17:21:57] <taplar_busy> so that means that logic should be in the function passed to the animate right?
[17:22:43] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: yeah I was not sure there I thought I was first sizing it to 0 and than fire another function that slides it out again
[17:23:03] <taplar_busy> animates are effectively asynchronous
[17:23:16] <taplar_busy> the code doesn't wait for them to finish before continuing
[17:23:25] <taplar_busy> that's the point of having the complete function argument
[17:24:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise all of your code would have to wait untilt he animation is done.
[17:24:23] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[17:25:09] <YamakasY> yap
[17:25:14] <YamakasY> so, shovle it in ?
[17:25:29] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah get it
[17:26:41] <YamakasY> but just shoble that whle part in there ?
[17:32:47] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: as I'm kinda confused there about the animate, I would have just one than ?
[17:33:26] <taplar_busy> you'd still have two, one for your slide in and the other for the slide out
[17:33:50] <al_nz1> Morning Peoples
[17:33:57] <taplar_busy> just the slide out depends on the slide in finishing first, so it would exist in your first's complete callback
[17:35:24] <al_nz1> Can anyone help me out with some code. I have a client sending data to the server with $.get(url, data) and need to get some basic server side javascript to handle the data coming back from the client (the data is fairly small every 30seconds or so)
[17:35:37] <al_nz1> but I am not very good with jquery
[17:35:49] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 you wouldn't use jq for that part.
[17:36:08] <robertmaxrees> server-side JS is node, which can us jquery but i'd suggest against it.
[17:37:35] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: but nbot in this order ?
[17:38:01] <taplar_busy> heh, what order do you need it in dude.  that's up to you, :)
[17:38:24] <al_nz1> robertmaxreesL thanks for that
[17:38:26] <taplar_busy> but like i said, anything that has to wait for an animate to finish, put that logic in the complete function parameter
[17:38:33] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: what would you suggest I look at?
[17:38:45] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 you want to do server-side js?
[17:38:45] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: what I said, slide out, set new text and slide in
[17:39:21] <taplar_busy> so there's your order, and what had to wait on what.  change it to do that
[17:40:00] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well I have some data coming back to the server, I dont know how to "handle" this code so that it can be logged
[17:40:04] <al_nz1> for viewing
[17:40:25] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 i'm really lost.  so you're sending data to your server from a browser, right?
[17:40:29] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: yeah trying to but I still get first text change, slide out and slide back in with the same text :S
[17:40:31] <robertmaxrees> so now you need to do something with that data?
[17:40:45] <taplar_busy> so what do you have now?  update the fiddle
[17:40:48] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yes - every 30s or so the browser is sending its latitude and longituade
[17:41:05] <slon> why does jquery.animate() have a 'fail' callback?
[17:41:06] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but I need to be able to see the data....
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> slon you mean like .fail()?
[17:41:24] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 so you need something server-side to handle that.  so you'd pick a server-side language/framework and go from there.
[17:41:25] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: not that much changed, only removed a function but than my IDE comaplains that one witdth is unused
[17:42:47] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well since I have been using javascript so far why not stay with that
[17:42:52] <slon> robertmaxrees: yeah
[17:43:08] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 then use node - there's a channel called #Node.js that you want to look at.  also lots of online resources.
[17:43:16] <robertmaxrees> slon .fail() exists because animate implements deferreds.
[17:43:18] <slon> robertmaxrees: why does fail ever get called for animate?
[17:43:21] <robertmaxrees> it's apart of the interface.
[17:43:27] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: thanks - that steers me in the right direction
[17:43:32] <robertmaxrees> so it may or may not fail, but the method has to exist as apart of that object.
[17:43:40] <slon> why would it ever fail?
[17:43:48] <robertmaxrees> slon i'm not saying that it would.
[17:43:50] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: wow - pretty quiet channel
[17:43:58] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 #Node.js?
[17:43:59] <al_nz1> oh wait
[17:44:01] <al_nz1> wrong channel
[17:44:09] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:44:14] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: :-)
[17:44:41] <slon> robertmaxrees I have an instance of animate where fail is getting called, i'm trying to figure out why
[17:45:02] <robertmaxrees> slon you can log out the data getting passed to it to find out.
[17:45:39] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember the args, but do .fail(function(a, b, c) {console.log(a); console.log(b); console.log(c); });
[17:45:44] <robertmaxrees> see if that tells you anything.
[17:45:55] <robertmaxrees> if you're really lost, show us the coide.
[17:45:57] <robertmaxrees> *code
[17:46:31] <slon> it just passes the promise/deferred as the first argument, nothing else
[17:46:40] <robertmaxrees> show us the code then.
[17:48:54] <slon> http://pastebin.com/raw/VYmGi7e0
[17:49:10] <robertmaxrees> oh that's not the promise interface.
[17:49:39] <slon> yes it is
[17:50:21] <robertmaxrees> no - the first arg passed to the callback is.
[17:50:30] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/79f4921834b7
[17:50:31] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[17:51:40] <slon> it's the same thing. promise, undefined, undefined
[17:51:45] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[17:51:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the code then.
[17:52:04] <slon> k
[17:52:06] <robertmaxrees> like - an example of it failing.
[17:52:50] <taplar_busy> wonder what you would get if in the fail you console.log(arguments)
[18:00:21] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: any clue there @ the order ?
[18:00:39] <taplar_busy> you've already said the order.  not sure what your confused about
[18:01:46] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: nah more how to combine the two
[18:01:50] <YamakasY> in code
[18:02:39] <taplar_busy> $element.animate({ ... }, function(){ /* change stuff */  $element.animate({ ... }); });
[18:02:40] <taplar_busy> ?
[18:04:35] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: so that part needs a whole rewrite ?
[18:04:53] <taplar_busy> if you want it to work as you've described you wanting it to, :)
[18:05:30] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: ok, but than I'm very confused about the if statement in that
[18:05:44] <taplar_busy> what if statement?
[18:05:56] <JD-Robbs> If I'm using a component that doesn't have a package.json, would I just manually chuck it into "random_stuff" and then let Grunt copy everything from "bower_components" and "random_stuff"? Not sure what's the best way to go about unregistered packages.
[18:06:06] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: wit the type
[18:06:12] <YamakasY> *with
[18:06:20] <robertmaxrees> JD-Robbs wrong channel?
[18:06:53] <JD-Robbs> robertmaxrees:  whoopsie, indeed! Sry :)
[18:06:58] <robertmaxrees> nbd :)
[18:07:09] <taplar_busy> what's confusing?
[18:08:16] <Heath_> hello is there a way to change this TD's with from 30% to 90% via query, since it's coming from a cms
[18:08:18] <Heath_> https://jsfiddle.net/ot7vjaux/
[18:08:24] <Heath_> thanks in advance
[18:08:57] <robertmaxrees> sure - use .prop()
[18:13:25] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: the fadeout and than the fadein with the if in it
[18:14:47] <taplar_busy> your fadein is same in the if and else, no?
[18:14:54] <taplar_busy> structurely
[18:15:10] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: yes
[18:15:15] <taplar_busy> so your doing
[18:15:43] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: I'm not doing anything working yet :)
[18:15:46] <taplar_busy> if { ..logic..  ..fadein.. } else { ..otherlogic..  ..fadein.. }
[18:15:55] <taplar_busy> which could just be
[18:16:09] <taplar_busy> if { ..logic.. } else { ..otherlogic.. } ..fadein..
[18:16:10] <taplar_busy> no?
[18:19:06] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: following my example ?
[18:19:07] <YamakasY> mhh
[18:19:16] <YamakasY> win 26
[18:19:18] <YamakasY> oops
[18:20:10] <cangelosx> is there a standard for processing an ajax response from a form with validation errors?
[18:20:52] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:20:58] <cangelosx> like, a standard I should format the json response from my server that would be better or easier for jquery to process and possibly display the errors on the form (bootstrap)
[18:21:33] <cangelosx> or even a REST standard
[18:21:41] <robertmaxrees> so jquery wouldn't process anything fwiw.  but not really.
[18:22:00] <robertmaxrees> kind of up to you - i might suggest using something like jquery validate and following its conventions, but that's totally your choice.
[18:22:28] <cangelosx> like some say code 400 and some say code 422, but don't specify the format
[18:22:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[18:22:57] <robertmaxrees> the format depends on your needs.
[18:23:14] <cangelosx> i was wondering if there's a format like {success:false, errors:{field_name:'blahblah'}}
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx nope.  i might shoot back an array of errors and check its length to see if I got any back.
[18:24:28] <robertmaxrees> then foreach through them and apply them back to the related elements, but otherwise, there's not really a standard for that.
[18:25:24] <cangelosx> I see. I'm more of a backend kinda guy and I can easily spit back the form with the errors but I was considering responding in JSON for optimization and performance
[18:25:33] <robertmaxrees> that's what you should do.
[18:25:46] <cangelosx> the first or the latter? lol
[18:25:52] <robertmaxrees> spit back json.
[18:26:03] <robertmaxrees> don't toss back all that markup, otherwise you're going to have to juggle bindings and things.
[18:26:48] <robertmaxrees> just toss back an object of fields that errord and what the error was.
[18:27:03] <cangelosx> and if needed to redirect on success just spit back a 300 or 302?
[18:27:22] <robertmaxrees> you always spit back the array - if there are no errors, you have an array of nothing.
[18:28:06] <cangelosx> way i have it now is 200 OK on success and 422 on validation error
[18:28:07] <Heath_> would I use .attr to change the width of a TD
[18:28:21] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ .prop() or .attr() - i'd suggest the former.
[18:28:23] <cangelosx> and on $.ajax() I have .success() and .error()
[18:28:38] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: so I figure only check for errors in response on .error()
[18:28:54] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx right, you also need to send back data.  and the success/error callbacks (which should really be .done() and .fail()) are really meant for whether or not the request itself succeeded or failed.
[18:29:08] <robertmaxrees> ypu could munge that definition if you so chose, but meh.
[18:29:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you already have it all figured out.
[18:29:28] <cangelosx> so i should check the actual error code in done() rather than go for success vs error
[18:29:41] <robertmaxrees> not the "error code" - if there were errors.
[18:30:03] <robertmaxrees> also: fwiw you should favor the promises interface, but that's neither here nor there.
[18:30:24] <cangelosx> can you tell me more? like I said, backend guy here.
[18:30:33] <robertmaxrees> ? about which part?
[18:30:36] <cangelosx> promises
[18:30:43] <robertmaxrees> .then()
[18:31:11] <cangelosx> what are they used for
[18:31:20] <cangelosx> https://api.jquery.com/promise/
[18:31:20] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jqXHR - little bit down from there: "The jqXHR objects returned by $.ajax() as of jQuery 1.5 implement the Promise interface"
[18:31:23] <cangelosx> its pretty vague to me
[18:31:37] <robertmaxrees> it replaces the callbacks you used to use for async operations.
[18:31:50] <robertmaxrees> you could drop in .done() and .fail() as direct replacements for success and error.
[18:32:22] <cangelosx> does fail include http codes with a valid response or just connection errors?
[18:32:55] <taplar_busy> fail is based on code
[18:33:04] <taplar_busy> non 200s and 300s i believe
[18:33:10] <shoky> and json parsing ;p
[18:33:10] <robertmaxrees> and more than that.
[18:33:16] <robertmaxrees> but the exact same as success/error.
[18:33:17] <cangelosx> oh i see
[18:33:26] <taplar_busy> shoky true
[18:33:28] <robertmaxrees> the method signatures and documentation show you as much :)
[18:33:29] <cangelosx> so they work the same, they're just better and have more features
[18:33:53] <robertmaxrees> more sensible and easier to manage when things grow.
[18:34:07] <shoky> and it's non 200 and non 304
[18:34:16] <cangelosx> for whatever i reason i understood as saying fail was a failed connection or timeout and done would include all error codes
[18:34:27] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: I really don't get it with the order, please help out.. :(
[18:34:28] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:34:33] <cangelosx> that makes sense though
[18:34:35] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY have you actually tried?
[18:34:48] <taplar_busy> can't help much right now.  *points at his nick*
[18:34:51] <robertmaxrees> if so, share what what you've tried and go from there.
[18:35:37] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: putting the slide out in in the if and else, same issue
[18:35:55] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY so try implementing it yourself and share your attempt if you need help.
[18:36:07] <robertmaxrees> pestering somebody to hold your hand like that isn't going to get you very far :)
[18:36:23] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: it actually "works" but it just doesn't wait and that is my issue... so I wonder why
[18:36:37] <cangelosx> I had this idea of disabling a form's submit button while an ajax call is in place, and I implemented it by adding certain data- attributes to the buttons I want disabled, then disable them on the start of an ajax call in $.ajaxSetup() and re-enable them when the call is over
[18:36:45] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: no I know but I'm really trying, don't be afraid :)
[18:36:46] <robertmaxrees> tapler spent a lot of time explaining earlier that you need to use callbacks to manage all of this YamakasY
[18:36:50] <cangelosx> and it's probably really bad practice, so I'm open to ideas
[18:37:10] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you want to avoid selecting things on data attributes.
[18:37:17] <robertmaxrees> since they're not really meant for selecting.
[18:37:26] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes, so need to make two functions for my if/else ?
[18:37:44] <YamakasY> I mean rip that out and call those in my if/else ?
[18:37:53] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i'd have to see it, but it sounds like you're doing the same call in both branches, right?
[18:37:57] <robertmaxrees> the exact same logic in either case?
[18:38:18] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: it was actually a class .disableOnAjax with data attributes saving the button's icon as I made it a spinner while ajax is pending, then setting it back to what it was
[18:38:40] <robertmaxrees> but you're not selecting on the data attribute right?
[18:38:43] <cangelosx> no
[18:39:18] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes, have you seen the pastie ?
[18:39:36] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY nope, but if that's the case, you just stick your code after the if else.
[18:39:40] <robertmaxrees> since it has nothing to do with what you want.
[18:39:54] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: it was $('.disableOnAjax') then I'd set its data-icon="fa fa-check" or whatever it was, setting its i tag to the spinner icon, then set it back when ajax is done
[18:40:18] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: nah that's not the case I think... here.. https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/1/
[18:40:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah as long as you also cancel the submit event for the form as well, you should be fine.
[18:40:20] <Heath_> whats the easiest way to make the div ZZZ in this example 100% width instead of it being locked to 30% from the TD
[18:40:21] <Heath_> https://jsfiddle.net/ntra49rk/1/
[18:40:34] <YamakasY> that is what taplar_busy cleaned up
[18:40:34] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: so it's not actually bad design?
[18:40:35] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ by using .prop() to change that attribute.
[18:40:36] <Heath_> i realized, maybe it can be done with the div? instead of messing with the TD width?
[18:40:39] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx nah.
[18:40:59] <Heath_> or is the TD locking that into 30% of the screen no matter what
[18:41:15] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ you've asked the same question about 4 times now and i've answered you each time.
[18:41:21] <robertmaxrees> what are you confused by?
[18:41:24] <Heath_> lol, i re/asked it
[18:41:37] <Heath_> i was thinking maybe i can change it via the Div vs the TD ?
[18:41:44] <robertmaxrees> change what?
[18:41:46] <robertmaxrees> the width?
[18:41:57] <Heath_> the text is like 30% of the screen not 100%
[18:42:00] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I wonder what would be a good clean way to associate an ajax call to a form
[18:42:14] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ right - you need to change the td'd width and the parent table, too.
[18:42:22] <Heath_> or you are saying go after the TD width via the .prop and forget about the <div>
[18:42:25] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: like, when I make the $.ajax() call and it responds with validation errors, I'd need to know which form to display the errors on
[18:42:32] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ exactly.
[18:42:35] <Heath_> ok
[18:42:53] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: where am I confused by ?
[18:42:56] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you can use the context option for that.  otherwise, you can send that information back as apart of your JSON response.
[18:43:20] <shoky> Heath_: you can just change the width=100 to width=100%  :)
[18:43:29] <shoky> Heath_: but uh.. use css
[18:43:31] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: the server is markup agnostic so it probably wouldn't know
[18:43:39] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: context - how's that work?
[18:43:44] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx read the docs.
[18:43:46] <robertmaxrees> it explains.
[18:44:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you could register a callback and pass the form to that callback.
[18:44:21] <cangelosx> how do I define a function that goes on every form?
[18:44:24] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY the only thing that's different between those conditions is the first two lines in each.
[18:44:29] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx huh?
[18:44:33] <robertmaxrees> .on() with a class?
[18:44:37] <cangelosx> where I can be like $('#myForm').submitAjax()
[18:45:00] <shoky> Heath_: oh nevermind, you don't even have more td's
[18:45:04] <robertmaxrees> that's extending jquery, and I might rethink that approach personally.
[18:45:05] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: true because I load other html
[18:45:07] <cangelosx> like, whenever I select a form tag, there will be a submitAjax() function
[18:45:16] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY but the rest is the exact same.
[18:45:16] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: why do you say that
[18:45:28] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah I thought this was the best way ?
[18:45:42] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx because now you're extending all of jquery to have that method on it - not necessary.  it's a convenience for .on()
[18:45:49] <robertmaxrees> that i personally wouldn't find very convenient.
[18:45:50] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[18:45:53] <YamakasY> I'm no javascript pro huh :) I made actually more exotic stuff than this back the days :S
[18:46:18] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4on0q8k4/2/
[18:46:19] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:46:35] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY the code's identical - you just have to move it after the condituionals.
[18:46:50] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: so just make a function submitAjax() and pass it the form?
[18:47:04] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok, good enough but than the slide would work like it should ?
[18:47:17] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx more like handleResponse(form, data);
[18:47:28] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i have no idea dude i don't have your site in front of me.
[18:47:37] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY but that code will be functionally identical to what you had before.
[18:48:05] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: what im wondering how to initiate the request in the first place
[18:48:08] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: no some local thinky :S
[18:48:11] <YamakasY> *thingy
[18:48:19] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx .on('submit', yourFunctionHere);
[18:48:41] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: and then just $('#form').submit() ?
[18:48:51] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx why are you triggering submit that way?
[18:49:00] <cangelosx> isn't that how you submit a form?
[18:49:03] <robertmaxrees> the form's submit button / pressing enter should work just fine.
[18:49:09] <cangelosx> oh, yeah
[18:49:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:49:40] <cangelosx> but that would prevent user from submitting form non-AJAX if needed
[18:49:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:49:55] <robertmaxrees> why would they need non-ajax?
[18:50:01] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: the only thing I need to have is that my second animate with if  needs to run when the first with width 0 has finished
[18:50:18] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY make a simplified fiddle at this point.
[18:50:18] <taplar_busy> YamakasY:how do you make it wait?
[18:50:30] <taplar_busy> *note: i've already said multiple times
[18:50:38] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: nope, and I'm googeling how to
[18:50:48] * taplar_busy sighs
[18:51:07] <taplar_busy> stick what should happen after the first animate, in a function passed into it
[18:51:07] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: yeah I'm no jquery pro :D
[18:51:16] <taplar_busy> read the docs
[18:51:26] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^
[18:51:26] <YamakasY> yewah doing so, learning every day :)
[18:51:28] <robertmaxrees> taplar_busy++++
[18:51:29] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: browser issues maybe?
[18:51:38] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: oohhh !
[18:51:42] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you should be able to safely assume that the browser supports ajax.
[18:53:37] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I suppose, and I guess if the user has javascript disabled then submit wouldn't be overridden and all is good.
[18:53:59] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you can reasonably expect people have javascript enabled today.
[18:54:23] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: i know, but building on that basis to make everything ajax-only seems kinda dangerous
[18:54:59] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you should ultimately support a fallback for non-javascript situations, but those will be exceptional and are really only worth it if your userbase is big enough and you can justify it.
[18:55:09] <cangelosx> if for some reason it was disabled it would cause issues, but then again submit would have default behavior and everything is good
[18:55:31] <robertmaxrees> sure - i wouldn't worry about that for now unless you really expect your audience to have that problem.
[18:56:16] <cangelosx> I've considered building on a frontend framework like Angular but I don't have much experience with JS and I don't like the idea of my source code laying out in public
[18:56:25] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:56:34] <robertmaxrees> your frontend source would be "laying out in public" anyway.
[18:56:40] <robertmaxrees> and not everything would be in your frontend obviously.
[18:56:48] <hackzor44> Why not just use angular? Its good as hell
[18:56:55] <robertmaxrees> i disagree with that statement, but heh.
[18:57:01] <robertmaxrees> a frontend framework CAN be helpful thoughg.
[18:57:02] <cangelosx> only the html, and copying it wouldn't create a working application
[18:57:20] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx a frontend framework won't change that.
[18:58:06] <cangelosx> actually it would - the GUI and the framework code is visible, and someone can easily replicate it to connect to my API
[18:58:22] <robertmaxrees> which is why you disable CORS.
[18:58:52] <robertmaxrees> but even then that still won't make your application more prone to copying.
[18:58:55] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: does that happen on the server side or client side?
[18:58:57] <robertmaxrees> because you'd only expeose the frontend.
[18:59:00] <robertmaxrees> server-side.
[18:59:08] <hackzor44> Anyone here familiar building interactive map-based apps using js and html5?
[18:59:09] <robertmaxrees> and nobody is going to copy your application anyway.
[18:59:22] <robertmaxrees> hackeron i might ask in ##javascript or #web
[18:59:57] <cangelosx> the application I'm building is simple in concept, and most of its value derives for the UX it provides
[19:00:29] <cangelosx> so if someone were to easily replicate it, it would lose almost all of its value
[19:00:32] <hackzor44> Oh ok 5th
[19:00:36] <hackzor44> Ty
[19:01:35] <duch_kazatel> woops.
[19:02:53] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[19:05:04] <robertmaxrees> but yeah cangelosx i wouldn't worry about somebody stealing your site.
[19:05:50] <robertmaxrees> those sorts of issues don't come up until you're huge.  and it happens regardless of the frontend/backend you're using.
[19:07:13] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I just feel like with straight http, they would have to code processed html, reverse engineer it to create the template and reverse engineer the backend which is pretty much equivalent to building it from scratch
[19:07:34] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx you're using straight http now anyway - do you mean html?
[19:07:44] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: as oppsed to a frontend framework where they can literally copy paste the source code in a few minutes and have it work right out of the box
[19:07:51] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: yes sir
[19:07:54] <robertmaxrees> and it'd be easy to discern how you build things.  and nobody is going to steal your site.
[19:07:56] <robertmaxrees> trust me :)
[19:08:06] <robertmaxrees> that sort of thing really doesn't happen that often.
[19:08:10] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: and you can't disable CORS if you have a mobile app that needs an API
[19:08:44] <robertmaxrees> true - you give the mobile devices a token they need to use.
[19:08:46] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: let's just say I've been offered $1M over 5 years for this project
[19:08:49] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways around that kind of problem.
[19:08:57] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx i still say it won't be a concern.
[19:09:25] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I believe you. I guess it's just that old school backend guy mentality kicking in.
[19:09:34] <robertmaxrees> i really wouldn't spend time worrying about that.
[19:09:44] <robertmaxrees> my company has had image assets linked from our servers once (that was a fun one to mess with) and one company straight stole our site's "skin" and plopped in opn a weird php thing.
[19:09:53] <robertmaxrees> and we're a pretty big size - but that's it.
[19:11:16] <cangelosx> I'm not so much worried about the media resources involved. It's the user experience and application logic part of the frontend that scares me.
[19:11:50] <cangelosx> the actual template could be any $17/$700 responsive theme - not worried  about ot
[19:13:14] <cangelosx> I suppose if I use token verification it would solve the problem for desktop web too
[19:13:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:13:54] <cangelosx> ..then I'd have to learn frontend framework from scratch
[19:13:59] <cangelosx> oh man
[19:14:03] <robertmaxrees> it's not a req :)
[19:14:21] <robertmaxrees> just helping you not worry about things you don't need to worry about.
[19:14:29] <cangelosx> I was considering contracting out the mobile app all together; that's how much I dislike frontend development.
[19:14:35] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: thanks : )
[19:14:42] <robertmaxrees> could always build a responsive site for now.
[19:14:46] <robertmaxrees> then worry about an app later.
[19:16:24] <cangelosx> I'm needing certain functionality on tablet/mobile devices like interfacing with wireless barcode scanners and I'm guessing that it won't be easy in a responsive mobile web
[19:16:57] <cangelosx> most likely bluetooth
[19:17:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.  sounds like you're building some kind of inventory management kind of system though.
[19:17:25] <cangelosx> a point of sale system, yes sir.
[19:17:41] <robertmaxrees> not bad -then i REALLY wouldn't worry about people stealing anything :)\
[19:17:44] <robertmaxrees> you'll be fine.
[19:17:58] <cangelosx> it's going to be a one of a kind project in the market it's targeted at
[19:18:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing an ecom component on top of that?
[19:18:24] <cangelosx> there are plenty of POS systems out there, but they're very expensive and tailored to a specific market
[19:19:16] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: retail
[19:19:25] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: like, brick and mortar retail
[19:20:03] <cangelosx> I don't know if you've heard of First Data's Clover Point of Sale system
[19:20:12] <arc_> on a mobile device you can use the camera as a barcode scanner
[19:20:28] <arc_> so unless you need the kind of volume you get at a grocery store, probably not that big of a deal
[19:20:29] <robertmaxrees> arc_ he'd need to interface it directly with his thing.
[19:20:44] <robertmaxrees> so he'd need something to scan it.  could ship it server-side actually.
[19:20:46] <robertmaxrees> hrmnnn,
[19:20:47] <arc_> gotta be a plugin for that i would imagine
[19:21:03] <arc_> web can definitely access the camera
[19:21:04] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx yep.  i've seen those.
[19:21:04] <cangelosx> the printed barcodes are very small and only scannable on a precise laser scanner
[19:21:13] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx wow that small?
[19:21:14] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: they made a decent system with a nice API and they made it affordable and easy for very small businesses to get it
[19:21:42] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: my software is just like that, except tailored to a different kind of retail industry
[19:21:46] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx ah, hence your limitation with their API.  nice.
[19:21:52] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: Clover is marketed to the service industry
[19:21:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:22:04] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[19:22:42] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok, this does fade in out. but does stay fadeout. When I change the flip the 500, fadeaway() data stays but therte is no slide https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/3/
[19:23:03] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY until you can get me a functioning fiddle, i can't really help.
[19:23:10] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: what do you mean my limitation with their API?
[19:23:57] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: oh, ok
[19:23:58] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx weren't you talking a while ago about how you couldn't modify something in a particulaar api becuase it was supplied by another vendor and your client wasn't going to get anywhere with that?
[19:24:12] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: actually, that's a different company
[19:24:18] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: but isn't that we try to get a working fiddle :D
[19:24:20] <robertmaxrees> ah hah,  fair enough.
[19:24:29] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i can't really help then.  sorry duder
[19:24:31] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: this is for the prepaid wireless industry
[19:24:41] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: oh I should beer you :PO
[19:24:53] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx fair enough.
[19:25:07] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: there are plenty of wireless service POS systems but they're for AT&T, Sprint, Verizon. BestBuy etc..
[19:25:11] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: and they're very expensive
[19:25:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm a little familiar with the industry.  doesn't surprise me.
[19:25:32] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: this software is for smaller prepaid carriers that don't have that kind of system
[19:25:43] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: the API I was talking about a while back? That's Sprint.
[19:26:02] <robertmaxrees> good times.  so yeah, good ideas all around.  i hope you figure it all out :)
[19:26:17] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: well, SPG. Sprint Prepaid Group. That's Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint Prepaid.
[19:26:29] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx 'kay.
[19:26:35] <Heath_> so what am i doing wrong here with .prop  ?
[19:26:36] <Heath_> https://jsfiddle.net/ntra49rk/3/
[19:26:48] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: sorry, I know you don't care.
[19:27:14] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I was just saying that Sprint doesn't provide an API for software to send activations directly to them. That's asll.
[19:27:17] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx it's more just the derail at this point :)
[19:27:20] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[19:28:10] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ bad selector.
[19:28:27] <robertmaxrees> there's a tbody that gets injected by the browser for the markup.
[19:28:35] <robertmaxrees> just use descendent selectors instead of direct child.
[19:28:51] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ntra49rk/5/ Heath_
[19:29:00] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: no no. that's okay. but that was the API I was talking about.
[19:29:19] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ and now your issue is the table's width
[19:29:42] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ntra49rk/6/ is this what you want?
[19:30:03] <Heath_> yes that is the output desired
[19:30:06] <Heath_>  $('table.zebra').attr('width', 500);
[19:30:10] <Heath_> i was just looking up that
[19:30:11] <Heath_> lol
[19:30:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to update both width props
[19:33:29] <Heath_> https://jsfiddle.net/ntra49rk/7/
[19:33:38] <Heath_> would that be correct if it was in that div
[19:33:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:33:53] <Heath_> just so i don't mess with other table/td widths
[19:33:56] <Heath_> on the page
[19:34:10] <Heath_> just want to isolate that certain TD
[19:34:39] <Heath_> i added a class/id
[19:34:40] <robertmaxrees> if you cna change that div ID to just be "breadcrumb" then yeah.
[19:34:42] <Heath_> to the jsfiddle
[19:34:54] <robertmaxrees> i saw ;)
[19:35:16] <Heath_> i can't change the output of the CMS
[19:35:21] <Heath_> i can only alter it
[19:35:27] <robertmaxrees> yuck.  confusing id.
[19:35:43] <Heath_> and salesforce is a multi billion company, lol
[19:35:56] <robertmaxrees> i know who salesforce is.  their platform is meh.
[19:36:12] <YamakasY> lol not even a when then doesn't waif for my .text() to change
[19:36:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ntra49rk/8/ Heath_
[19:36:25] <robertmaxrees> use vars when you can.
[19:36:36] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY huh?
[19:36:50] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY there's no need to "Wait" - changing text is a synchronous operation.
[19:37:52] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ok, how can avoid that ?
[19:37:56] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY avoid what?
[19:38:15] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: synchro... make it a syunchro
[19:38:18] <robertmaxrees> it IS.
[19:38:20] <YamakasY> asynchro
[19:38:21] <robertmaxrees> i just said it is.
[19:38:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't want it to be asynchronous.
[19:38:33] <YamakasY> ok, so I need to hide whit first
[19:38:36] <YamakasY> *shit
[19:38:41] * YamakasY flushes the toilet
[19:39:08] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: would you be interested in frontend/mobile app work when the time comes?
[19:39:14] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx nope :)
[19:39:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm plenty busy as-is, but thanks.
[19:39:34] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: haha. I get you.
[19:39:44] <YamakasY> cangelosx: only when it serves live free 3d pr0nn I guess :D
[19:39:46] <robertmaxrees> we're in the middle of a HUGE project at work and my personal life is CRAZY right now.
[19:40:05] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: relax the biatch!
[19:40:12] <robertmaxrees> uh, what?
[19:40:41] <YamakasY> when you personal life is getting stressed under it, woman are involved :P
[19:40:46] <robertmaxrees> that's really sexist.
[19:40:55] <robertmaxrees> and pretty uncool.
[19:40:57] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I feel you. I'm over here coding in a retail environment, working a project for this retail environment, and testing it on this retail environment.
[19:40:58] <YamakasY> er ?
[19:41:24] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx i hear you.
[19:41:27] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: no, is just that they can freak out when you don't moawl your grass and so on :D
[19:41:27] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I code, smoke, and, sometimes, eat and sleep.
[19:41:38] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY that's actually really sexist still.
[19:41:54] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY women can mow lawns and men can get just as upset as women over things.
[19:41:58] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: and I guess go on #jquery and #laravel.
[19:42:02] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx hah.
[19:42:13] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: no, sexist is telling, oh you don't have time for s*x so you fail and you bitchslaps you because of it
[19:42:22] <YamakasY> that is
[19:42:31] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY actually, it is sexist.
[19:42:48] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: no, you are making it bigger than it is
[19:42:50] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: my wife: "Are you gonna code all night again? :("
[19:42:57] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY actually, it'm not.
[19:43:01] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: what if you are/were gay and a man was involved ?
[19:43:27] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY hey so i'm not going to have this discussion with you right now :) if you'd like to PM me about it, feel free!
[19:43:37] <YamakasY> cangelosx: she sleeps less good I think when you are not around
[19:43:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, please do not refer to women that way.  thanks!
[19:43:57] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: heh, men can freak out too ;)
[19:44:04] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY please drop it.  thanks!
[19:44:21] * YamakasY wanders off
[19:44:34] <cangelosx> YamakasY: she just wants to spend time with me like, you know, a normal couple. lol.
[19:45:24] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx hah.  my wife and i are slowly getting back into a normal routine again.
[19:46:06] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: sometimes she puts on something sexy or acts all sexy and here I am into my code all oblivious.
[19:46:26] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: she understands though. she's really supportive and awesome.
[19:46:33] <YamakasY> cangelosx: yes like sleeping in a normal way, waking up., etc :D
[19:46:51] <igrekun> Guys, is there a way to get every exact element containing certain word? contains() gives me topmost parent items too
[19:47:08] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: she says I'll make it up to her by taking her to Italy and Spain when we're "rich" from the project. Lol.
[19:47:18] <robertmaxrees> igrekun not easily.
[19:47:44] <robertmaxrees> cangelosx heh we're going to italy and france this year.
[19:48:15] <igrekun> is it a very CPU intensive task?
[19:48:28] <robertmaxrees> igrekun it can be, yes.  why do you need that?
[19:48:32] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I am envious. I'm not lucky enough to be able to physically get away from my retail businesses.
[19:48:44] <cangelosx> Not at the moment anyway.
[19:48:48] <robertmaxrees> you'll get there.
[19:48:52] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: kewl goign to hide some other span, simpler than the text thingy
[19:49:09] <igrekun> userscript to filter out elements
[19:49:10] <cangelosx> Yeah, hopefully once this thing kicks off and all.
[19:49:18] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: but you cannot avoid that to do a .text() later on ?
[19:49:44] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY huh?
[19:50:04] <cangelosx> robertmaxrees: I definitely appreciate all your insight. I'm feeling better about the frontend implementation. Thanks again.
[19:50:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah definitely man.  relax and have fun with it :)
[19:50:23] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: as I said, my display is done first and than my animate
[19:50:30] <YamakasY> is that so difficult to understand ?
[19:50:34] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY your questions are really disjointed.
[19:50:43] <robertmaxrees> what does .text() have to do with hiding/showing something?
[19:53:20] <taplar> finally home!  heh.  i'm going to have to get a drink first...
[19:53:27] <robertmaxrees> "a"
[19:54:23] <Heath_> that worked - thanks robert, here is my last question of the hour
[19:54:34] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/15/    trying to change the word
[19:54:53] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ er.
[19:55:04] <Heath_> city:
[19:55:07] <robertmaxrees> you want the element that contains "City" and change its text?
[19:55:18] <Heath_> but i know i am not addressing it correctly here:   (  $('#event.  )
[19:55:37] <robertmaxrees> so #event.text is selecting an element with that ID AND class.
[19:55:38] <Heath_> just want to change the word City: to XYZ
[19:55:39] <robertmaxrees> that class is a child.
[19:55:46] <robertmaxrees> and that selector is gross.
[19:55:59] <robertmaxrees> also: you're using .replace() wrong in this case :)
[19:56:36] <taplar> the selector is duplicated too
[19:56:43] <robertmaxrees> that too.
[19:56:55] <robertmaxrees> i'll give you a freebie on this one.
[19:57:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/WM6wG/16/
[19:57:32] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use .repalce(), you need to pass the whole thing to .text()
[19:57:43] <robertmaxrees> .text() just returns a string - .text(someString) sets it.
[20:01:30] <YamakasY> damn whatever I do it always first shows my stuff I want to slide to and than slide :S
[20:01:39] <YamakasY> aaahhhh!!!
[20:01:45] <taplar> where's your updated fiddle?
[20:01:54] <robertmaxrees> *functioning fiddle.
[20:02:15] <YamakasY> I'm hacking around here
[20:02:19] <Heath_> actually just checked, and there is a strong there
[20:02:22] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/18/
[20:02:25] <YamakasY> need some local lookups
[20:02:29] <Heath_> updated the problem
[20:03:07] <taplar> the comma is outside
[20:03:34] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ so is THIS indicative of your code?
[20:03:44] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ and read the coide.
[20:03:51] <robertmaxrees> match is City: ,
[20:03:58] <YamakasY> nah this is odd whatever I change in my functions, order, whatever it always does the same thing at the end
[20:03:59] <robertmaxrees> what're the contents of the <Strong> ?
[20:04:13] <Heath_> basically yes they are spitting out City: ,
[20:04:18] <Heath_> and there is no city
[20:04:19] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY if you add console logs do you see them?
[20:04:21] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ ...
[20:04:21] <Heath_> so it looks ugly
[20:04:28] <Heath_> inside the html it's
[20:04:31] <robertmaxrees> your match var will never match that span.
[20:04:33] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: logging all the time
[20:05:06] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY and those are changing?
[20:05:53] <Heath_> why? should i be searching for the strong tags inside of it
[20:06:08] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ what's the text in the strong?
[20:06:13] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/19/
[20:06:23] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[20:06:27] <robertmaxrees> really?
[20:06:33] <robertmaxrees> you realize .text() reads text, not nodes.
[20:06:38] <Heath_> that weird comma happens to be outside of it on the next line
[20:06:50] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want?
[20:06:55] <robertmaxrees> i'm terribly lost at this point.
[20:07:15] <robertmaxrees> your target keeps moving :)
[20:07:15] <Heath_> just trying to replace    "City: ,"
[20:07:17] <Heath_> with ""
[20:07:27] <Heath_> don't want that showing up
[20:07:29] <robertmaxrees> so you want to find the strong that contains that and the following comma?
[20:07:35] <Heath_> yes
[20:07:46] <robertmaxrees> why not just wholesale replace the contents of the div then?
[20:08:39] <taplar> YamakasY: you still got your fiddle pulled up?
[20:08:41] <Heath_> i forget why i need to do it this way, but check out how i been wholesale replacing
[20:08:42] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/20/
[20:08:49] <Heath_> things that works with salesforce
[20:08:54] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ i'm really confused.
[20:08:59] <Heath_> ugh.
[20:09:00] <Heath_> lol
[20:09:09] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ so why not just wholesale replace?
[20:09:30] <Heath_> i did just try that last example
[20:09:31] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/20/
[20:09:35] <Heath_> and it didn't find it
[20:09:49] <Heath_> (outside the jsfiddle)
[20:10:03] <Heath_> i been trying to just mock up easy jsfiddles here
[20:10:18] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ it sounds like you want to find a particular set of text nodes.  otherwise, i'd explore just using .html() and replacing everything with whatever you want.
[20:10:20] <Heath_> to isolate
[20:10:34] <YamakasY> taplar: yap
[20:10:45] <YamakasY> taplar: need the link ?
[20:10:52] <Heath_> .html doesn't work, because so much is going on
[20:11:03] <taplar> YamakasY: https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/3/  <-- line 43.  what are you doing right there?
[20:11:12] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ err, i'm way lost mano.  but you could use .html instead of .text() for what you want.
[20:11:14] <robertmaxrees> i guess.
[20:11:20] <robertmaxrees> something seems way off here there.
[20:11:54] <Heath_> i mean this works
[20:11:55] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/21/
[20:12:07] <YamakasY> taplar: I thought about calling that function above after my animate for fadeout finished :)
[20:12:13] <YamakasY> but that was a wrong guess
[20:12:28] <taplar> regardless, what are you doing on line 43?
[20:12:33] <YamakasY> I even tried it with seperate functions and when then, same result
[20:12:38] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/22/
[20:12:42] <Heath_> as a better example
[20:12:48] <YamakasY> taplar: find in again ?
[20:12:48] <Heath_> it's hard to nail that comma
[20:12:50] <YamakasY> *fading
[20:13:04] <Heath_> in the search
[20:13:08] <taplar> it's expecting a function definition/reference
[20:13:11] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ you realize what $('body') does, right?
[20:13:18] <Heath_> not really
[20:13:22] <YamakasY> taplar: that function is on line1
[20:13:25] <YamakasY> line 1
[20:13:28] <taplar> yep
[20:13:39] <Heath_> taplar sent me a link to a query tutorial that i need to review soon
[20:13:40] <YamakasY> so that should work you say ?
[20:13:41] <taplar> what are you doing on line 43?
[20:13:45] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ heh you'd do well do check out that tutorial now.
[20:13:46] <taplar> nope
[20:13:50] <robertmaxrees> because you're missing a lot of basics.
[20:14:00] <YamakasY> I miss the ; you mean ?
[20:14:02] <Heath_> i know, i am old school html 1.0
[20:14:18] <taplar> what is that line doing?  your not answering this question
[20:14:25] <Heath_> and i am just trying to fix problems for display purposes in real time
[20:14:34] <YamakasY> taplar: calling that function on line 1!
[20:14:37] <taplar> :)
[20:14:40] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ so check out that tutorial.
[20:14:42] <Heath_> my head needs to wrap around this query, selectors...etc
[20:14:44] <taplar> should you be?
[20:14:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to be banging your head against the way.
[20:14:56] <YamakasY> taplar: yes as I faded out ?
[20:15:00] <taplar> no
[20:15:01] <Heath_> oh it's bang'd already
[20:15:02] <YamakasY> oh!
[20:15:07] <taplar> as i said, animate is expecting a reference
[20:15:12] <YamakasY> taplar: tell me what I do wrong there
[20:15:17] <YamakasY> ok
[20:15:19] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ so then get some knowledge :)
[20:15:25] <Heath_> luckily i have FAT TIRE beers handy
[20:15:39] <taplar> tell me what a function declaration/reference is
[20:15:40] <Heath_> well i actually learn a lot from my brief stints here
[20:15:51] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: Heath_ you are messing up taplar and mine conversation :P type slower :P
[20:15:51] <Heath_> i just need to learn the core of it, when i have a free sunday
[20:15:57] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ i'm  a bigger fan of sierra nevada on account i'm less than a mile away.
[20:16:01] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY no thanks ;)
[20:16:13] <Heath_> less than a mile from the real TAPS?
[20:16:17] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: eat it!
[20:16:29] <Heath_> you can get a growler to go?
[20:16:30] <Heath_> lol
[20:16:31] <YamakasY> taplar: erm, I need to look that up in this case
[20:16:32] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:16:34] <robertmaxrees> i'm in chico, mano.
[20:16:36] <taplar> k
[20:16:41] <Heath_> nice
[20:16:54] <Heath_> i buy the 12 packs, for $14.00
[20:17:00] <Heath_> on sale
[20:17:03] <Heath_> sampler ones
[20:17:04] <robertmaxrees> i buy them for 6 or so.
[20:17:06] <Heath_> variety
[20:17:09] <robertmaxrees> oh those things.
[20:17:11] <Heath_> for a 12 pack?
[20:17:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, the seasonal packs.
[20:17:18] <robertmaxrees> we pay like $10 here for those.
[20:17:21] <Heath_> nice
[20:17:33] <YamakasY> taplar: oh you mean a var set ?
[20:17:41] <taplar> can be
[20:17:46] <taplar> but doesn't have to be
[20:18:13] <YamakasY> taplar: no that is why I call it like that
[20:18:25] <taplar> guess i'll explain it
[20:18:34] <taplar> your executing the function there
[20:18:37] <YamakasY> yeah plase do,
[20:18:40] <YamakasY> please
[20:18:42] <YamakasY> yes
[20:19:04] <taplar> a function declaration is when you create it, be it a named function or an anonymous function that is optionally assigned to a variable
[20:19:17] <taplar> at that point, the name of the function, or the var it is assigned to, is the function reference
[20:19:27] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY please stop spamming me in PM
[20:19:28] <taplar> it's not executed until you reference() it
[20:19:30] <Heath_> how would i target that comma, this isn't working
[20:19:30] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/23/
[20:19:47] <Heath_> pulling out my unix \n skills
[20:19:53] <Heath_> 8-p
[20:19:54] <taplar> when functions want callbacks provided, they want a reference
[20:20:01] <taplar> because they will choose when to actually invoke it
[20:20:07] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I got a message from you
[20:20:07] <taplar> such as this case
[20:20:09] <YamakasY> I didn't PM you
[20:20:18] <taplar> if your not going to pay attention i'm going to stop
[20:20:45] <YamakasY> taplar: no I'm reading up, robertmaxrees was PM me, I cannot focus on you than :)
[20:21:03] <YamakasY> taplar: yeah I saw thjing about those callbacks
[20:21:37] <taplar> so with that in mind, what are you doing wrong on line 43
[20:22:52] <YamakasY> taplar: I'm calling a function without reference
[20:23:06] <taplar> rephrase
[20:23:30] <YamakasY> I'm just calling that function without defining why, it's just a call() out of the blue ?
[20:23:40] <taplar> you can't call something that isn't defined
[20:23:46] <taplar> but side stepping that
[20:23:50] <taplar> yes, your calling it.
[20:24:17] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: ignored you, please stop spamming thanks
[20:24:37] * taplar tried
[20:24:48] <YamakasY> taplar: and I need to tell why I'm calling it
[20:24:53] <robertmaxrees> I am not going to ask again.  Please be more respectful YamakasY.
[20:25:00] <YamakasY> or actualy let it know
[20:25:18] * YamakasY notices this keyboard types better than the other PC, odd keyboard
[20:25:56] <YamakasY> taplar: ok, so I need to work on the callbacks and read more about them ?
[20:26:12] <taplar> i just explained them
[20:26:39] <YamakasY> taplar: yeah true, but that is the docs I should read again for extra references to my issue ?
[20:26:49] <YamakasY> to get is clear as much as possible ?
[20:27:13] <taplar> sure, but i just boiled it down for you.  not sure what your confused on
[20:27:38] <Heath_> i just thought of something, anything after the "City: " match, i don't need
[20:27:43] <Heath_> does that help?
[20:27:54] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ "i don't need" meaning...
[20:28:02] <Heath_> like i don't want to display
[20:28:17] <robertmaxrees> sure - .html() is exactly what you want in this case :)
[20:28:22] <Heath_> so in the code i see    <strong>City: </strong>
[20:28:36] <Heath_> that match and all after it till the closing /div
[20:28:41] <Heath_> i don't have to display
[20:28:49] <YamakasY> taplar: no, not that, if want to read something back I know where to look :D
[20:28:52] <robertmaxrees> right, you just use .html() and replace the entire div with what you want.
[20:29:03] <YamakasY> and don't need to bother you
[20:29:19] <taplar> random google for later: http://recurial.com/programming/understanding-callback-functions-in-javascript/
[20:29:32] <YamakasY> merci!
[20:29:43] * YamakasY never gives up :D
[20:29:44] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/24/
[20:30:00] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ is that first line static?
[20:30:03] <robertmaxrees> or does that change, too?
[20:30:11] <robertmaxrees> like, how much of thsi is staic content vs. dynamic?
[20:30:24] <YamakasY> Heath_: heh, you are happely fiddeling around :)
[20:30:26] <Heath_> its all dynamic based on events
[20:30:29] <robertmaxrees> and now you're adding new elements.
[20:30:34] <Heath_> so before the city is all dynamic
[20:30:44] <robertmaxrees> heh mind setting up a fiddle with actual markup?  keeps changing.
[20:30:46] <Heath_> the static part we can 100% match is that <strong city
[20:31:17] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of looking at enumerating through text nodes at this point.
[20:31:28] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i might hide that entire container and write in your own replacement.
[20:31:30] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/25/
[20:31:35] <Heath_> does that make more sense?
[20:31:53] <robertmaxrees> sure, did you see what i said about just hiding it and doing your own thing?
[20:32:07] <Heath_> no
[20:32:12] <Heath_> i have to hit /clear
[20:32:18] <Heath_> when i am bouncing between tabs
[20:32:22] <Heath_> so when i get back to here
[20:32:24] <robertmaxrees> "i might hide that entire container and write in your own replacement."
[20:32:25] <Heath_> i can follow along
[20:32:30] <YamakasY> ok,. crappy keyboard again
[20:32:39] <YamakasY> taplar: that link was nice :) thanks
[20:32:44] <taplar> np
[20:32:56] <Heath_> well the event data is dynamic, from a databse
[20:32:59] <Heath_> like webinars
[20:33:02] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:33:07] <Heath_> so i have no clue what it will spit out
[20:33:09] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ you're kind of stuck at this point.
[20:33:26] <robertmaxrees> Heath_ you're basically going to need to enumerate through the text nodes and go from there.
[20:33:32] <Heath_> but to be honest, there isn't really anything after the
[20:33:34] <Heath_> City: ,
[20:33:42] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really change my point.
[20:33:51] <Heath_> so that is really what I just need to replace with  ""
[20:33:56] <Heath_> haha
[20:34:14] <robertmaxrees> plus anything you come up with will be suuuper fragile.
[20:34:24] <Heath_> oh like backwards
[20:34:27] <Heath_> to find the strong
[20:34:32] <robertmaxrees> or forwards.
[20:34:33] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[20:34:36] <robertmaxrees> you're kind of SOL
[20:34:40] <Heath_> backwards is easier
[20:34:47] <Heath_> fragile part of it, is ok
[20:34:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd copy the things you want to a new container and nuke everything else.
[20:34:58] <robertmaxrees> but (shrug)
[20:36:19] <robertmaxrees> this is what happens when you have janky markup :)
[20:36:37] <robertmaxrees> surprised it's not more formally output.
[20:37:30] <Heath_> its whackamoly
[20:37:45] <Heath_> how would i remove the last comma before a closing div
[20:37:46] <Heath_> 8-)
[20:38:17] <robertmaxrees> enumerating through textnodes and finding the last one in a container then doing a .replace() on that and slapping the text baack into place.
[20:38:34] <Heath_> http://jsfiddle.net/WM6wG/27/
[20:39:03] <Heath_> because it's down to this last comma
[20:39:04] <Heath_> ugh
[20:40:02] <Heath_> seems like there is code here for it
[20:40:03] <Heath_> http://jsbin.com/uxepap/5/edit?html,js,output
[20:40:10] <Heath_> gotta check it out
[20:40:24] <robertmaxrees> if you read the docs, you'll see what that's doing.
[20:40:35] <Heath_> i know
[20:40:38] <Heath_> i wish i had time
[20:40:40] <Heath_> tonight
[20:40:45] <robertmaxrees> either way, that'll replace the first comma in whatever string you give it.
[20:40:55] <Heath_> i'm like trying to fix a problem in real time, and head out the door for a date
[20:40:56] <robertmaxrees> what sort of deadline are you rushing against?
[20:40:58] <Heath_> lmao
[20:41:10] <Heath_> umm the date or the code
[20:41:17] <taplar> lmao
[20:41:20] <robertmaxrees> wat
[20:41:31] <robertmaxrees> why can't you read any docs right now before attempting to fix this?>
[20:41:38] <Heath_> i sent the link to show them the changes with that stinking comma in it
[20:41:47] <Heath_> i just know tomorrow they will be like, yes, can you remove that last comma
[20:41:56] <Heath_> so i guess i can head to the date
[20:42:06] <robertmaxrees> sure - take care of that problem tomorrow :)
[20:42:08] <Heath_> UBER | LYFT where art u
[20:43:39] <Heath_> thanks - see you tomorrow
[20:43:41] <Heath_> lmao
[20:47:01] <YamakasY> taplar: http://callbackhell.com/ LOL
[20:47:25] <taplar> it's all subjective
[20:47:33] <robertmaxrees> gotta be careful - easy to avoid though.
[20:47:37] <robertmaxrees> promises make that really easy to manage.
[20:47:45] <taplar> much like any code, it's only as confusing/clear as you make it
[20:47:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[20:48:42] <YamakasY> yap
[20:48:52] <YamakasY> everything new is confusing :)
[20:48:59] <YamakasY> it starts @ the age of 16
[20:49:12] <robertmaxrees> nah.  some new things are confusing.
[20:49:16] <Guest25265> I'm trying to figure out how to reverse the behavior of a checkbox that's been styled using this - http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/material-design-switch - if the AJAX call fails, i want to undo the user action (the toggle)
[20:49:18] <taplar> though i will say, naming functions has/can have the benefit of self documentation
[20:49:18] <robertmaxrees> other new things can be intuitive.
[20:49:24] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[20:49:24] <YamakasY> yap
[20:49:32] <robertmaxrees> i make it a personal rule to never use anonymous functions.
[20:49:48] <Guest25265> i've got it firing properly. but i can't figure out how to fire an action to force change the toggle back
[20:50:27] <robertmaxrees> mshadle looks like you want to change the .prop('checked', false);
[20:50:37] <Heath_> it's only as confusing/clear as you make it  (true)
[20:51:12] <robertmaxrees> also: keep functions short.
[20:51:20] <mshadle> hah! that was it! thank you robert.
[20:51:25] <robertmaxrees> mshadle yep.
[20:51:31] <mshadle> i was monkeying about somewhere else
[20:51:55] <mshadle> is there an easy way to toggle whatever the opposite of it is (if it's enabled, i want it to be back to true)
[20:52:08] <taplar> you could ! the prop
[20:52:14] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('checked', !$(this).prop('checked'));
[20:52:26] <robertmaxrees> though i'd be careful with that.
[20:52:28] <robertmaxrees> toggles are weird.
[20:52:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd explicitly check so your code makes more sense later.
[20:53:24] <mshadle> hmm. well this is quite basic and that works great.
[20:53:31] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[20:53:39] <robertmaxrees> be careful.
[20:54:21] <YamakasY> taplar: need to read more, even with my callback it happens!
[20:54:29] <taplar> updated fiddle?
[20:54:38] <YamakasY> no tested locally, but can fiddle
[20:54:44] <robertmaxrees> aaand with that i go home.
[20:54:44] <YamakasY> need to go home in a whule 3 am here
[20:54:47] <YamakasY> *while
[20:54:50] <mshadle> for how simple this code is and since it is a boolean i can't imagine it behaving incorrectly in this regard. but if i do wind up with an issue, i guess the suggestion is to check the prop first, etc
[20:55:03] <robertmaxrees> mshadle it always starts simple :)
[20:55:13] <mshadle> i try to *keep* it simple ;)
[20:55:15] <robertmaxrees> mshadle i'm always overly clear to get out ahead of issues.
[20:55:39] <mshadle> yeah if i could picture any way this might behave differently i'd do it differently too.
[20:55:45] <mshadle> i think this is pretty safe for my basic case
[20:55:59] <taplar> is it clear why your doing it?
[20:56:03] <YamakasY> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/4/
[20:56:05] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[20:56:53] <taplar> your not giving animate a callback
[20:57:17] <YamakasY> aha!
[20:57:25] <YamakasY> in the fadeawy ?
[20:57:39] <taplar> your not giving *animate* a callback
[20:58:28] <YamakasY> taplar: if I set that, to vanishes and doesn't come back @ 200
[20:58:45] <taplar> how were you trying it?
[20:59:02] <YamakasY> Razerglass: you mean line 47 on 44 ?
[20:59:25] <taplar> any of the animates
[20:59:39] <YamakasY> taplar: ok, but I'm not following on the other ones
[20:59:41] <taplar> your giving them options and a duration, but no callback
[21:01:42] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/animate/  under "Basic Usage" is a basic example
[21:01:54] <YamakasY> taplar: ok thanks
[21:02:02] <taplar> it has options, a duration and a callback
[21:05:18] <YamakasY> taplar: yes ok that works, but still, first I get the part in the .domain changed than the slideout/slidein
[21:06:01] <taplar> updated fiddle?
[21:07:45] <YamakasY> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/4on0q8k4/6/
[21:08:02] <YamakasY> mhh callback is not used
[21:08:38] <taplar> your giving animate empty callbacks...
[21:09:13] <YamakasY> yeah what to put in than, this is too much guessing aorund, please update a little bit as I'm seeing trees only
[21:09:18] <YamakasY> and bears :D
[21:09:29] <taplar> that callback is the complete callback
[21:09:36] <taplar> it executes, when the animate finishes
[21:09:48] <taplar> so whatever you want to happen, when it finishes, put it in ther
[21:10:02] <taplar> if nothing, don't give it a callback
[21:10:26] <YamakasY> taplar: ok, I want to give back what it does in that animate
[21:10:33] <YamakasY> that is where it should end with
[21:10:34] <YamakasY> 200
[21:11:14] <taplar> your animate on line 39 is the first animate right?
[21:11:37] <YamakasY> yap
[21:11:46] <taplar> so when it finishes, then you want to do other stuff, right?
[21:11:52] <YamakasY> ad one of the thow from fdageawy is where it should end with
[21:12:08] <YamakasY> *fadeaway
[21:12:09] <YamakasY> yes
[21:12:24] * YamakasY excuses for thsi stupid corsair keybaord, some dev likes it it seems
[21:12:30] <taplar> so whatever should follow the finish of that animate, put it in or call it from, that complete callback
[21:13:03] <YamakasY> ok, but I don't get how!
[21:13:15] <taplar> how do you put logic in a function?  just do it
[21:13:17] <YamakasY> I have read that docs multiple times but it's buzzing my head atm
[21:15:52] <YamakasY> taplar: I'm really confusewd how to callback in a callback as that is happening there
[21:18:13] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/w8nu75zs/
[21:18:59] <taplar> your telling it what to do when it's done
[21:19:16] <YamakasY> okay that makes sense
[21:31:55] <YamakasY> taplar: kewl I did it
[21:32:03] <taplar> yay
[21:32:06] <YamakasY> need to check something about my tyming
[21:32:11] <YamakasY> timing tho
[21:33:54] <YamakasY> taplar: LOL my timing seems to to be twice as fast
[21:39:56] <YamakasY> taplar: it slide nicely in but it kinnda "pops" out with the animate
[21:41:56] <taplar> domainName.css('width', 'auto');
[21:42:35] <YamakasY> nah it seems I moved my second animate to a wait
[21:43:17] <YamakasY> taplar:
[21:43:24] <YamakasY> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/
[21:43:55] <YamakasY> so the 200 waits a couple of seconds now before it moved and than pops back in like an F16
[21:45:32] <YamakasY> something goes wrong there
[21:48:20] <YamakasY> fixed too!
[21:48:44] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/1/
[21:51:18] <YamakasY> yap true, need to test your example, I have some wrong sizing here, something it's ok
[22:02:13] <Danith> wow.. this is a channel
[22:02:21] <Danith> anyone use select2
[22:06:08] <YamakasY> taplar: ok, almost there, this misxes up the sized when I change lenths https://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/1/
[22:06:50] <taplar> that's the link i gave you
[22:07:32] <YamakasY> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/2/
[22:08:07] <jphase> Danith: just go ahead and ask and if someone can help they will
[22:08:08] <taplar> so your still setting the width to auto before you expand it
[22:08:19] <taplar> which is going to make it pop to full width
[22:08:29] <YamakasY> taplar: yeah sometimes it overlaps
[22:08:47] <taplar> you need to get the original width before you minimize it and then use that instead of changing it to auto
[22:09:06] <Danith> well.. I'm trying to activate an element that apparently is 'select2' using IE com operations.. and.. can't :p
[22:09:31] <Danith> and was wondering if anyone had any tips or gotchas
[22:09:53] <YamakasY> taplar: yes but I can't set in both statements
[22:09:56] <YamakasY> can I ?
[22:10:01] <taplar> huh?
[22:10:24] <YamakasY> yeah I thought so ?
[22:10:38] <taplar> i don't understand what your asking
[22:10:47] <taplar> "both statements"
[22:10:54] <YamakasY> in the if/else the size it set
[22:10:55] <taplar> you gotta be specific dude
[22:11:06] <YamakasY> taplar: yeah 4am here
[22:11:11] <taplar> again, that animate is duplicate.  you don't need two
[22:11:19] <YamakasY> no I have one now
[22:11:20] <taplar> move it outside after the if else
[22:11:25] <YamakasY> did that
[22:11:42] <taplar> ok, sweet
[22:11:49] <YamakasY> but where to set the size ?
[22:11:50] <taplar> so what was the issue with getting the width first?
[22:11:54] <YamakasY> I mean determine it
[22:12:03] <taplar> before you change it to zero
[22:12:19] <YamakasY> ir just is wobbeling around, not fitting as it should
[22:17:23] <taplar> also your animate to width is not in your complete method.  come on dude
[22:18:48] <taplar> if you tidy your code it's easier to see what is nested in what.  really hard to read with the spacing you have
[22:19:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[22:20:15] <hellyeah> taplar: her if you are there can i ask very tiny question?
[22:20:22] <taplar> sup
[22:20:49] <hellyeah> just as moment
[22:20:53] <hellyeah> a*
[22:24:22] <hellyeah> line 58-80 i used map there what i want is to get last dates from datepickers and put int outputArray but when you create second datepickers and select the dates array looked like that arr(2), arr(2) you can see on the console. Is there a way to avoid that lile make outputArray or smt like that. each time i just need last dates on array. https://js
[22:24:23] <hellyeah> fiddle.net/nk1brr1k/15/
[22:25:04] <hellyeah> actually i can handle the issue wityh using forEach but i just want to learn stuff.
[22:26:20] <hellyeah> hopine my question is understandable
[22:26:31] <taplar> i'm reading
[22:26:39] <hellyeah> thank you
[22:27:51] <taplar> so say your question again?
[22:30:41] <hellyeah> sure
[22:31:19] <hellyeah> taplar: i used map to return an array return date  line 77
[22:31:38] <hellyeah> so i can have dates on outputArray
[22:32:03] <hellyeah> but when you create second date pickers outputArray looks like that arr(2),arr(2)
[22:32:24] <hellyeah> but i just want to see only last dates so it would be arr(2)
[22:32:39] <taplar> last dates?
[22:33:03] <hellyeah> let say you create new datepickers
[22:33:09] <taplar> the last datePicker?
[22:33:13] <hellyeah> yes
[22:33:29] <taplar> so why not get/select it on line 57?
[22:33:42] <taplar> your getting all of them
[22:34:07] <hellyeah> you mean last().map() ?
[22:34:27] <taplar> that's what your after, no?
[22:34:35] <hellyeah> hmm ye
[22:34:39] <hellyeah> let me try
[22:36:58] <hellyeah> thank you taplar
[22:37:08] <hellyeah> i am doing some small mistakes
[22:37:27] <hellyeah> i hope you wernt angry with me to take your time fr small problem :D
[22:37:41] <taplar> i'm not busy anymore.  *points at his nick*
[22:38:00] <hellyeah> yeah first time i saw you with _busy
[22:38:07] <hellyeah> generally i see you _afk
[22:38:11] <hellyeah> saw*
[22:38:48] <taplar> yeah, i just have a lot going on at work right now so i can't really participate fully when i'm there for now
[22:38:59] <hellyeah> ic
[22:39:06] <hellyeah> can i ask a question?
[22:39:15] <taplar> shoot
[22:39:16] <hellyeah> is my progress kinda good?
[22:39:34] <taplar> your not doing a multi dimension array anymore, :)
[22:40:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[22:40:47] <hellyeah> :p
[22:40:56] <hellyeah> i am asking generally
[22:41:09] <hellyeah> at least i can write my own code without so many instruction
[22:41:22] <taplar> cool
[22:42:30] <hellyeah> my aim is http://jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxcalendar/rangeselection.htm
[22:42:50] <hellyeah> when user select dates i want to colorize the range of dates you select
[22:43:07] <hellyeah> for example colorize between 29 JAN - 31 JAN
[22:43:18] <hellyeah> it is possible to produce random color in javascript
[22:43:29] <taplar> random?
[22:43:45] <hellyeah> yes
