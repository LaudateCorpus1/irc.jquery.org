[02:40:52] <hellyeah> is jquery 3.1.2 so different than 1.10.2?
[02:46:00] <Cork> quite a few functions has been removed
[02:46:25] <Cork> and support for ie<9 isn't there either (as 2.x removed that)
[02:53:05] <hellyeah> is there a list for that
[02:53:07] <hellyeah> ?
[02:53:17] <Cork> api.jquery.com
[02:53:35] <Cork> you can find deeper explanation at blog.jquery.com
[02:54:40] <hellyeah> i guess make a list of function of jquery 3.1.2 and 1.10.2 will help
[02:55:01] <hellyeah> i start working in a company software was written by indian company
[02:55:07] <hellyeah> we still workin on it
[02:55:13] <hellyeah> they used jquery 1.10.2
[02:55:20] <hellyeah> i am suprised to see that
[02:55:35] <hellyeah> i will offer him to move environmeny 3.1.2 or something
[02:55:39] <Cork> well 1.x isn't deprecated so...
[02:55:48] <Cork> it is still a maintained branch
[02:55:50] <hellyeah> i think using 1.10.2 will slow the page down
[02:56:05] <Cork> eh... ya a little, but not much
[02:56:12] <hellyeah> okay but depreceated thing is security leak at the same time right
[02:56:12] <Cork> unless you do a lot of work you won't notice
[02:56:21] <Cork> no
[02:56:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[02:56:24] <hellyeah> okay
[02:56:40] <hellyeah> Cork,  i dont know really
[02:56:45] <Cork> the reason ie<9 is not supported in jquery 2.x and 3.x is to reduce the lib size
[02:56:52] <Cork> not security
[02:56:53] <hellyeah> there is verious version between 3.1.2 and 1.10.2
[02:57:12] <hellyeah> so 1.10.2 support ie9
[02:57:12] <Cork> sure you can bump it to 1.12.4
[02:57:18] <hellyeah> is that it?
[02:57:18] <Cork> that would be the current latest release
[02:57:35] <hellyeah> 1.12.4 is the current?
[02:57:43] <Cork> https://code.jquery.com/
[02:57:45] <hellyeah> iisnt it 3.1.2?
[02:57:50] <Cork> both are
[02:58:07] <Cork> 1.x and 2.x AND 3.x are supported branches
[02:58:11] <Cork> it isn't one replaces the other
[02:58:19] <hellyeah> oh i see
[02:58:30] <hellyeah> 1.12.4 is the latest version of 1.x
[02:58:37] <Cork> wich one you need pedepnds on what situation you use it in
[02:58:45] <Cork> *depends*
[03:00:11] <Cork> hellyeah: this might explain it a bit http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/
[03:00:13] <hellyeah> just wondering that can i tell if it is ie=9 use 1.12.4 else use 3.1.2
[03:00:37] <Cork> hellyeah: you can, but you should first and formost check if you _NEED_ 3.x
[03:00:56] <Cork> cause using two different versions of jquery will cause incompatibility risks
[03:01:14] <Cork> as for example jsonp can't have errors in jquery < 2.x
[03:01:15] <hellyeah> i see
[03:01:33] <Cork> (as old ie doesn't provide the event so nothing to trigger on)
[03:02:09] <Cork> so it is not just something you should do a switcharo on, you need to understand the project; what it does, what it needs and what needs to be changed
[03:02:57] <hellyeah> i see
[03:03:02] <Cork> it might be perfectly find to switch, and it is even quite likely; but you need to make sure
[03:03:37] <Cork> the jquery-migrate lib is create to help with it; but you still need to know your project
[03:03:45] <Cork> *created*
[03:04:20] <hellyeah> so
[03:04:36] <hellyeah> the first step is to learn asking why you use jquery 1.10.2
[03:04:44] <hellyeah> what is theexact reason of that?
[03:04:55] <Cork> no, that is not what i mean
[03:05:01] <Cork> you need to know the codebase
[03:05:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:05:21] <Cork> what features it uses and where they are called from
[03:05:23] <hellyeah> i need to see js code
[03:05:24] <hellyeah> ?_
[03:05:25] <b-ot> ?underscore
[03:05:30] <Cork> yes
[03:05:35] <hellyeah> i see okay
[03:06:20] <hellyeah> i understand that takes time for ssure
[03:06:44] <Cork> when you know how the project works you can load the new version of jquery and jquery-migrate and then exercis those code paths, it will log if something won't work in the new version
[03:07:06] <Cork> then you can correct the places that needs to be corrected, or possible abort cause it isn't supported
[03:07:33] <Cork> but that won't be tested unless you know what you need to test; hence the understanding
[04:57:30] <blahblah_> hello
[04:58:57] <blahblah_> I'm having a strange issue I can't figure out: alert($('body')) prints null, but when I look at the page I can see the body. Any clue what might be wrong?
[05:00:19] <pavonia> Where/when is that code run? Maybe the element isn't ready yet
[05:00:43] <Cork> blahblah_: also never EVER use alert for debugging
[05:01:05] <Cork> alert forces the browser to do a lot of weird things that means the data you get won't be accurate
[05:01:10] <Cork> so, always use console.log()
[05:01:56] <Cork> and ya, if you run $('body') in the head without waiting for the dom to stabilize the body won't have been created yet
[05:02:13] <Cork> $(function() {}) does the said waiting
[05:03:34] <blahblah_> I'm calling this code from a Tempermonkey script, will try console.log()
[05:03:53] <Cork> ah, user script doesn't always have access to console.log
[05:04:16] <blahblah_> well it prints null too :/
[05:04:17] <Cork> but they have a lot of other isolation situations that means they don't behave like page scripts
[05:05:57] <Cork> blahblah_: start by setting @run-at document-idle
[05:06:00] <blahblah_> also tried to put the selector and console.log() call from inside a callback with setTimeout, but it's always null
[05:06:26] <Cork> ya, i suspect you're hitting the isolation
[05:06:37] <Cork> i don't remember what you need to do to access the page dom from gm scripts
[05:06:48] <Cork> @grant might help (set it to none)
[05:07:37] <Cork> anyway not really on topic for this channel; not sure there is a gm script channel though...
[05:08:10] <Cork> blahblah_: might be worth asking in #greasemonkey
[05:08:34] <blahblah_> oh indeed, thanks
[05:09:22] <hellyeah> hey again
[05:10:02] <hellyeah> so only reason of using jquery 1.x, jquery 1.x has some events or something that i.e.9 supports. Is that right?
[05:10:14] <Cork> no
[05:10:19] <Cork> it is much deeper then that
[05:10:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:10:40] <hellyeah> okay
[05:10:44] <Cork> ie8 and older for example uses attachEvent instead of addEventListener
[05:10:53] <hellyeah> if there is any reading i would like to read that
[05:10:55] <Cork> and document.all instead of document.querySelectorAll and so on
[05:10:57] <hellyeah> ah right
[05:11:14] <hellyeah> well these are vanilla javascript
[05:11:15] <Cork> jquery 1.x has compatibility code to support that difference
[05:11:23] <Cork> 2.x and 3.x doesn't
[05:11:25] <hellyeah> i see
[05:11:32] <hellyeah> well ie crap right
[05:11:44] <Cork> hence the ie9 support for 2.x and 3.x
[05:11:59] <Cork> well as a developer one sure thinks so, but not all sites have an option
[05:12:06] <Cork> ie is still very big in some countries
[05:12:18] <hellyeah> yeah
[05:12:22] <hellyeah> so microsoft
[05:12:28] <Cork> and i mean ie6 by ie in this case
[05:12:51] <hellyeah> Cork,  jquery-migrate is like shim?
[05:13:01] <hellyeah> es5-shim, es6-shim ?
[05:13:04] <Cork> no
[05:13:12] <hellyeah> hmm not similar okey
[05:13:21] <Cork> it is a tool to help the site maintainer find what code need to be fixed
[05:13:23] <hellyeah> what about plolyfills?
[05:13:35] <Cork> there are some compatibility functions in it
[05:13:42] <Cork> but it doesn't extend the browser
[05:13:44] <hellyeah> i see
[05:13:49] <Cork> so no for shim or polyfill
[05:14:15] <Cork> but mainly it has logging to help find problems
[05:14:24] <hellyeah> okay so if i use jquery 3.1.2 i should also use convenient jquery-migrate lib for 1.x version is it correct?
[05:14:34] <Cork> ... no
[05:14:41] <hellyeah> okay
[05:15:08] <Cork> like i said before; if the site used 1.x you should use the specified migration lib to MIGRATE TO THE NEW VERSION ex. 3.1.x
[05:15:34] <Cork> there are similar migration versions for 2.x to 3 and so on
[05:16:11] <Cork> hellyeah: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/README.md
[05:17:54] <hellyeah> oh like jquery 1.10.2 and jquery-migrate-3.1.2
[05:17:58] <hellyeah> let me read that
[05:18:16] <Cork> ya... please do -_-'
[05:19:17] <hellyeah> okey first paragraph make sense
[05:19:28] <hellyeah> understand the issue thank for sharing your time with mr
[05:27:11] <andi> Hello, can you tell me how I can access the object a jQuery().on trigger runs on? The code I have is: https://paste.sixhop.net/phgbqjypg/fwe3ki
[05:28:50] <hellyeah> i think you should use jsfiddle
[05:32:01] <Cork> andi: element it works on?
[05:32:08] <Cork> it runs on document
[05:32:38] <Cork> nfFormSubmitResponse is a fake event so e or an additional argument might hold where it comes from
[05:32:51] <Cork> you could for example give e.target a check
[05:33:01] <Cork> but ya, as i don't know the event i can only guess
[05:38:29] <andi> So the event is one from ninja forms, which is a plugin for wordpress. The goal is to figure out from which ninja form this code has been triggered. At the moment it doesn't matter which form triggers this code, it's getting fired on every form. The solution from them is to connect this code to the button within the form which leads to an execution of the code whenever the button is pressed. When the form has required fields and the button gets pressed ...
[05:38:35] <andi> ... this code gets triggered, but the form is not sent.
[05:39:05] <andi> Ok, I'll give e.target a try.
[05:47:09] <andi> Ah, I can give a class to the form and then do a if(jQuery('.form-class').length) { console.log('form exists'); } else { console.log('form does not exist'); }
[05:52:06] <KnightsOfNi> Does anyone know what lodash method to use to extract the option[] values into an array? https://jsfiddle.net/jyotq3yx/
[05:52:41] <KnightsOfNi> So result should be [297, 303, ... ] etc
[06:21:07] <KnightsOfNi> is there a way to include data-... attributes in the result of a serialized form?
[06:41:58] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: not automatically no
[06:42:12] <Cork> you can use serializeArray() and then append the attributes
[06:48:26] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[07:53:21] <lissitzki> hi folks
[07:55:46] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/v8joagkj/ from this code, I'd like to have my menu hiding, with the same delay, from last to the first and ehn showing again the menu
[07:55:59] <lissitzki> 'then'
[07:56:21] <lissitzki> hiding on click
[07:56:34] <lissitzki> starting to work on it
[07:58:01] <Cork> lissitzki: you haven't animated the show
[07:58:10] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/v8joagkj/1/ is prob what you want
[07:58:53] <lissitzki> yes
[07:58:55] <lissitzki> sorry
[07:59:27] <Cork> and for the hiding just give the next function $myMenu.length -1
[07:59:33] <Cork> and loop backwards
[08:01:35] <lissitzki> allright
[09:40:20] <tilerendering> hey
[09:41:09] <tilerendering> anybody got some experience with jQuery.i18n ? I m curious about its performance (delays) in applications with lots of internationalized fields visible simultaneously
[10:33:10] <dariolap> Hi all, I need a plugin that allows to upload multiple files or directory (like Google Drive)
[10:55:02] <thykka> dariolap, upload where?
[10:55:36] <dariolap> thykka, ajax file upload plugin
[10:56:03] <thykka> you backend accepts uploads and knows how to process them?
[10:56:11] <thykka> *your
[10:56:22] <dariolap> Yes
[10:56:29] <dariolap> i need only a plugin
[10:57:15] <dariolap> https://webix.com/widget/uploader/ like this but free
[10:57:33] <thykka> nobody *needs* a plugin, but okay.. did you check out these? https://colorlib.com/wp/jquery-file-upload-scripts/
[11:00:36] <dariolap> why nobody?
[11:01:11] <thykka> because there's this :) https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/
[11:02:33] <thykka> no wait.. that might be the wrong spec..
[11:03:30] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Submitting_forms_and_uploading_files
[11:25:54] <tilerendering> do you know of any i18n solution allowing for multiple files per locale/language? or where I can individually specify where the translation can be found?
[12:01:46] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I didn't figure out how to get .filter() to split entire groups of children, but I did expand on the code I wrote yesterday to instead of simply making sections it also makes a tabular table of contents for Bootstrap: https://www.bootply.com/ChWtMfg1sq
[13:12:59] <lintguy> A library has an event, how can i attach my own function to that trigger?
[13:15:46] <duch_kazatel> depends on the library and event.,
[13:16:27] <lintguy> Yeah, I figured I'd try addEventListener on the trigger and that worked.
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> what library is it?
[13:17:31] <lintguy> Closed source on, else i'd pastebin it
[13:17:35] <lintguy> one*
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> how does it handle publishing events?
[13:17:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery's trigger or something else?
[13:18:09] <lintguy> Events.trigger so i guess it's jquery's?
[13:18:32] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, Just realized you weren't in the channel earlier when I sent this. I didn't figure out how to get .filter() to split entire groups of children, but I did expand on the code I wrote yesterday to instead of simply making sections it also makes a tabular table of contents for Bootstrap: https://www.bootply.com/ChWtMfg1sq
[13:18:40] <robertmaxrees> is it doing something like .trigger('foo') lintguy ?
[13:18:48] <lintguy> Exactly
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> link might be a jquery event then.  try using jquery's on
[13:20:05] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: on is using addEventListener right?
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> slightly different.
[13:20:39] <robertmaxrees> the jquery event subsystem and native DOM events are a little different.\
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> especially with custom events.
[13:20:46] <lintguy> Alright
[13:20:54] <lintguy> I'll need to read up on that
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt 'kay.
[13:23:43] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt those cases where you're doing stuff like sections[i].push(this); are great candidates for filter.
[13:24:41] <tsukasadt> If I could figure out how to do it, I'd be glad to, but I can't seem to grasp the logic needed to maniuplate with .filter() to pull it off. ^^'
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> also: you're doing a multidimensional array there for some reason.
[13:25:15] <tsukasadt> I'm not even done with that code, either. I'm expanding it to create dropdowns to the H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6s.
[13:25:23] <robertmaxrees> aaaah because you're trying to group them.
[13:25:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:25:45] <robertmaxrees> fair enough.
[13:27:22] <tsukasadt> Long story short, I'm trying to make this script generate and format long documentation on a custom DMS into a "less-painful-on-the-eyes" format.
[13:28:34] <tsukasadt> Generating a ToC that double as tabs seemed like a perfect solution, but trying to figure out how I'll do the dropdowns is proving a headache. ^^'
[13:29:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah... heh.  i worry that your JS is gonna get a little heavy-handed.
[13:30:28] <tsukasadt> As do I. I already have the dropdown code, since it's build into Bootstrap, I just need to dynamically apply it to the dynamiccally generated tabs and add detection to ensure the proper tab gets loaded (if needed) then scrollTo the designated header.
[15:37:45] <gambl0re> hello?
[15:55:21] <robertmaxrees> helluva day
[15:59:52] <gambl0re> hi robert
[16:04:39] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:06:19] <gambl0re> hows going?
[16:07:19] <robertmaxrees> goes
[16:23:58] <gambl0re> hi robert, do you use es6 at your workplace?
[16:24:16] <robertmaxrees> we use es2015 and higher iirc.
[16:24:18] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[16:25:53] <gambl0re> just curious.
[16:25:59] <robertmaxrees> uh.  okay.
[16:26:15] <gambl0re> how do you feel about es6?
[16:27:10] <robertmaxrees> i feel like newer editions have addressed some complaints about the language but it missed the mark on some other parts.
[16:29:41] <gambl0re> like what?
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> i'm not a fan of the added class syntactic sugar.
[16:31:18] <gambl0re> you're not the only one
[16:31:28] <robertmaxrees> well aware.
[16:33:38] <gambl0re> what about arrow functions?
[16:33:52] <robertmaxrees> i think people misuse them frequently and don't fully understand them.
[16:33:57] <robertmaxrees> but they're mostly a good idea.
[16:35:09] <gambl0re> misuse like how?
[16:35:45] <robertmaxrees> they don't understand why 'this' doesn't work in cases like jquery event handlers.
[16:37:09] <gambl0re> ic
[16:37:25] <robertmaxrees> many people mistake them for simply being a shorthand, but they are functionally different.
[16:38:28] <gambl0re> when you use 'this' inside a function, 'this' is bound to the function?
[16:38:35] <gambl0re> inside a arrow function i mean
[16:38:53] <robertmaxrees> no.  if you're looking for more information, I'd go to ##javascript.
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> they'll be able to help you more with that.
[16:39:21] <gambl0re> ok
[16:40:39] <grapheti> scopin' dat this
[16:42:38] <tsukasadt> robertmaxrees, I convinced my boss that a single dropdown level was sufficient, so this is what I came up with: https://www.bootply.com/LN5lnffbpW
[16:44:19] <tsukasadt> The line count nearly doubled to pull off the dropdown.
[16:44:23] <robertmaxrees> tsukasadt :/
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just render this the right way in the first place?
[16:45:02] <tsukasadt> Because the people using it won't have any idea what they're doing.
[16:45:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:45:26] <tsukasadt> They get a pretty RTE to build their content and this formats the display.
[16:45:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm super confused.
[16:45:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking about where you render this stuff.
[16:46:17] <robertmaxrees> like, a little bit of what you're doing is fine, but you're getting into a pretty nasty hole here.
[16:46:21] <tsukasadt> Because the code being supplied for rendering is made by them, so I'd have to do all this manipulation in PHP instead of jQuery.
[16:46:39] <robertmaxrees> right
[16:46:44] <robertmaxrees> which is where you *should* be doing it.
[16:47:18] <robertmaxrees> you're experiencing the downsides to doing this all client-side already.
[16:48:25] <tsukasadt> I could do the HTML rendering in PHP, but ~1/2 of the jQuery would still be needed to handle the ToC functionality.
[16:48:41] <robertmaxrees> "the ToC functionality"?
[16:48:49] <robertmaxrees> why can't you fix the way that page gets rendered?
[16:48:55] <tsukasadt> The dropdown/tabular functionality merge.
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> why would half of that need to be in the JS?
[16:49:21] <robertmaxrees> or w/e
[16:49:51] <tsukasadt> Because neither Bootstrap nor jQuery supports combining the functionality of dropdown menus with tab views.
[16:50:06] <tsukasadt> So, actually, it'd be closer to 1/3 of the code.
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> heh, ignoring the question of "why" you'd want to do that in the first place, at the very least you're not doing nearly as much data munging.
[16:50:39] <tsukasadt> Anyways, I just wanted to let you know I got a solution.
[16:50:48] <robertmaxrees> which would really be ideal.
[16:50:58] <tsukasadt> The "why" is because I was told to.
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'm ignoring that part ;)
[16:51:32] <tsukasadt> bleh, I get yelled at for doing so.
[16:51:47] <robertmaxrees> i mean I'm not questioning the why.
[16:52:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm pretending like that's already been decided and that there's no point in bringing it back up.
[16:52:55] <tsukasadt> Basically. So, yeah, I got a pure-jQuery solution, as annoying as it was to make. ^^'
[16:53:10] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:53:13] <robertmaxrees> alrighjt.
[23:07:53] <devi8> I have a function that takes a ul element, multiplies it's length by the height of the first li element and returns that value. initially, I cycle through all the submenus and log their parent's anchor before calling the getMenuHeight() function on them and the same formula doesn't work? any ideas why? https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/EQxjOq?editors=1111
[23:08:35] <devi8> *multiplies the length of its children, by the first child's height...sorry.
