[00:41:50] <clime> hey, in this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/clime/KL6YQ/1/ Is it possible fix this fiddle so that alert is shown every time and not only first?
[00:47:01] <Cork> clime: you would have to use .progress() callbacks or build your own with $.Callbacks
[00:47:25] <Cork> deferred sets once for the callbacks so it will never fire again
[00:48:25] <clime> cork, allright thanks, I wanted to clear that up
[00:48:44] <Cork> clime: deferred uses $.Callbacks internally
[00:48:51] <Cork> so it isn't too hard to build what you want
[00:50:03] <rabbi1> $("#myform").submit(function(event) { }); Similarly, why isn't there a $("#myform").reset(function(event) { }); method ?
[00:50:29] <Cork> rabbi1: those shorthands are only for fairly old and commonly used functions
[00:50:46] <Cork> s/functions/events/
[00:51:03] <Cork> rabbi1: and .on('reset' isn
[00:51:09] <Cork> *'t much longer
[00:51:15] <Cork> 3 chars to be exact :)
[00:52:07] <rabbi1> Cork: so, there is nothing i can do an event when the reset button is clicked ?
[00:52:13] <Cork> opps 5 :x didn't count the quotes
[00:52:23] <Cork> rabbi1: sure you can
[00:52:27] <Cork> i just told you how
[00:52:39] <rabbi1> .on(reset)
[00:52:41] <rabbi1> thanks
[01:03:34] <banzounet> hey guys why is the trigger('click') not triggering the element here : http://jsfiddle.net/3YgXC/1/ ?

[01:56:42] <jgf9> hi
[01:58:45] <jgf9> I have a select control where multiple options can be selected. I'm calling a jquery function when the 'change' event is fired...   and then in this function I want to find out what the last value changed was and whether it was selected or deselected. does anyone know how I can do this in jquery?
[01:59:06] <jgf9> I see that I can use $("option:selected:last", this).val();   to find the last selected value.. but this doesn't work for deselected values
[02:13:56] <Cork> jgf9: you would have to store the old value and compare it to what is currently selected
[02:14:22] <Cork> jgf9: and no need to go the round about way though a selector like that
[02:14:33] <Cork> just do $(this).val() and you will get that
[02:15:16] <Cork> jgf9: the reason you need to store it your self is plainly cause the dom doesn't store the value
[02:27:10] <bigbugjava> I need a step by step guide for datatables Jquery, www.datatables.net gets a lot of incorrect links. so it's no good

[02:43:54] <felixjet> how do you counter the number of childs of a div ? .lenght or .size ?
[02:44:06] <Cork> length
[02:44:08] <felixjet> thx
[02:44:15] <Cork> size is a function that just returns length
[02:44:24] <felixjet> and its deprecated as i see now
[02:44:44] <Cork> jQuery.fn.size = function() { return this.length; }; <-- this is the actual code for size
[02:44:53] <Cork> so it is really pointless
[02:48:49] <jgf9> ok I see. thanks Cork

[02:55:23] <gry> (I have not resolved the question I asked, so far; I would appreciate any help.)
[02:57:55] <Cork> gry: your doing cross protocol loading of jquery

[04:00:31] <airdem> hi guys
[04:01:29] <airdem> i have this "loading" function that generates an overlay + loading gif for a element. somehow it does not work with jquery ui dialogs. any ideas why? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7562055
[04:02:05] <airdem> the loading animation just gets appended to the dialogs content
[04:09:52] <airdem> wake up my virtual helpers! :P
[04:11:16] <Cork> airdem: why do you not just set a background through css?
[04:11:31] <seutje> airdem: position: absolute; ? but yeah, cork's point is pretty valid as well
[04:12:19] <airdem> if i set a background it work work as an overlay preventing the user to click any of the dialogs content elements, no?
[04:13:40] <seutje> he meant as a background to the dialog wrapper
[04:16:33] <Cork> content.addClass('loading')
[04:17:21] <Cork> .ui-dialog-content.loading { background-image: url(gfx/loading.gif); background-position: 50% 50%; background-size: 70%; }
[04:20:07] <airdem> Cork, that looks crazy :P
[04:20:17] <Cork> the first line is js
[04:20:20] <Cork> the second is css
[04:20:25] <airdem> yeah i got that
[04:20:31] <Cork> (and i meant it to be static)
[04:20:53] <Cork> its nice in that it moves styling to css (where it belongs)
[04:21:05] <Cork> and keeps js as short and minimal as it can possibly be
[04:21:14] <airdem> the result is funky :) loading.gif gets strechted on the background of the dialog
[04:21:40] <airdem> and im still missing an overlay that prevens the user to click on the content, but its a good start
[04:21:45] <Cork> airdem: that was the background-size line
[04:22:12] <Cork> airdem: ah if you need an overlay you need to use position: absolute
[04:22:17] <Cork> and an extra element
[04:23:41] <airdem> Cork, thats what my loading function was doing. but it only works outside of a dialog atm
[04:24:35] <airdem> replacing background-size with background-repeat: no-repeat; puts the loading gif in the right place but unfortunately its behind the dialogs content
[04:25:19] <airdem> let me try to put this in a fiddle
[04:26:18] <Cork> airdem: http://jsfiddle.net/4S6xa/
[04:27:13] <Cork> airdem: and for completeness http://jsfiddle.net/4S6xa/1/
[04:30:49] <airdem> Cork, you are boss!
[04:37:02] <hiteshtr> why jquery is unable to select id with dash like this "search-name" ??
[04:37:14] <Cork> should work just fine
[04:38:02] <Cork> hiteshtr: http://jsfiddle.net/yuHWj/
[04:39:02] <hiteshtr> Cork: but when i used selector with .on() function it didn't work
[04:39:24] <hiteshtr> then i have to change the id and it got working fine
[04:39:26] <Cork> hiteshtr: i suspect you look at the wrong end
[04:39:41] <Cork> the element is added later in the page existence right?
[04:39:48] <hiteshtr> yes
[04:39:49] <Cork> it doens't exist from the start
[04:40:00] <Cork> then $('#search-name') won't match it
[04:40:02] <Cork> cause it doesn't exist
[04:40:16] <joroci> what do you think is the best scroller for jquery?
[04:40:20] <Cork> $(document).on('click', '#search-name', function() {})
[04:40:50] <hiteshtr> Cork i used the last syntax u showed to me
[04:41:16] <Cork> hiteshtr: do you have multiple elements with the same id?
[04:41:37] <hiteshtr> Cork: no not at all only one
[04:41:51] <Cork> hiteshtr: then it should work
[04:42:06] <caliel> Hello. If I try to defer jQuery loading at the end of the file (I use a .js file that load other scripts dynamically), jQuery doesn't get loaded. Do you have suggestions ?
[04:42:07] <Cork> hiteshtr: you need to show the problem in a fiddle
[04:42:34] <Cork> caliel: it loads but all the load help it normally give you won't work

[04:46:56] <Cork> or is it a number or?
[04:47:11] <dwarder_> Cork: doesn't string(var) type cast my var?
[04:47:21] <Cork> dwarder_: js isn't typed
[04:47:38] <Cork> so you don't need to cast it as long as it
[04:47:46] <Cork> -as long as it
[04:48:02] <dwarder_> Cork: if it is number it will give me the first char?
[04:48:16] <dwarder_> var = 1000
[04:48:21] <dwarder_> var[0]
[04:48:25] <dwarder_> == 1

[04:49:31] <Cork> caliel: from where?
[04:49:36] <Cork> the console?
[04:50:18] <caliel> Cork: i use a js to load other scripts and css related (i.e. camera.css only when I need the camera plugin). But I cannot load jQuery this way.
[04:50:35] <Cork> caliel: you need to wait for the load callback
[04:50:41] <Cork> and yes it works
[04:51:34] <caliel> Cork: ?

[04:56:05] <caliel> Cork: so, I load jQuery and then, inside that function I load other scripts ?
[04:56:10] <meadhikari> hi, i want to loop through all tr of a table which class name i have, please help

[04:57:09] <caliel> Cork: I will try. Thank for now.
[04:57:24] <Fisher> Hey Guys, i'm pretty new to jquery in general, but on a project i'm working on i have some range sliders using ui.slider, in the same form i have some radio buttons, for some reason the radio buttons change the values of the slider, is there anyway i can prevent this from happening?
[04:57:39] <Bauer1> guys, I have a div from which I am trying to retrieve the value using like: $( "#23901-Price" ).val(); but apparently it works only on input type elements
[04:57:47] <Bauer1> how do I retrive the div content?
[04:57:51] <Cork> O_o
[04:58:03] <Cork> Fisher: you have some code cross talk there
[04:58:09] <Cork> Fisher: that does NOT happen normally
[04:58:31] <rccc> hello, got a question about mobile
[04:58:34] <Cork> Bauer1: .text() if you just want the text or .html()
[04:58:37] <rccc> in this example : http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html
[04:58:55] <rccc> GET params are visible in the url
[04:58:55] <bigbugjava> I really need help, I have an object, I want to append it to a datatable.. tried datatables.net, with no success... anything eles in mind for anyone?
[04:59:08] <Bauer1> Fisher: I happen to be working with UI sliders atm, they are in no way related to radio buttons, inspect your code
[04:59:27] <rccc> but i was thinkink jquerymobile removes this parameters ...
[04:59:53] <Fisher> hmmm, so strange! i'll continue to inspect my code, i've been trawling through it for sometime and can't see anything obvious.
[05:00:05] <rccc>  i created a list view with url
[05:00:19] <rccc> but i don't have these GET params in the url ...
[05:00:56] <Bauer1> thanks Cork, .text will do nicely
[05:10:39] <Fisher> Bauer1/Cork: Thanks, i'm looking through my code now, and whilst i'm a complete newbie, i can't see anything obvious that i can spot...
[05:11:44] <Cork> Fisher: try reproducing it in a jsfiddle
[05:12:09] <bigbugjava> I have a modal, that is getting excuted by 2 different links, why it works only 1 time, I mean that I if I click one and then try the other, the other wont work
[05:12:31] <bigbugjava> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'modal'
[05:12:31] <Cork> bigbugjava: are you replacing content in the page?
[05:12:38] <Cork> <_<
[05:12:42] <bigbugjava> Cork yeah
[05:12:48] <bigbugjava> loading it with jquery
[05:12:50] <Cork> that error is something else
[05:13:05] <Cork> looks like something is overwriting jquery
[05:13:22] <Cork> check if your loading scripts in the new content
[05:13:28] <Cork> like ex. prototype.js
[05:13:55] <bigbugjava> Cork I load html pages with modal javascript inside with $ load
[05:14:19] <bigbugjava> function Builder()
[05:14:19] <bigbugjava> {
[05:14:19] <bigbugjava>     $('article').load("pages/builder.html");
[05:14:19] <bigbugjava> }
[05:14:19] <bigbugjava> function Edit()
[05:14:20] <bigbugjava> {
[05:14:20] <bigbugjava>     $('article').load("pages/editcheck.html");
[05:14:21] <bigbugjava> }
[05:14:24] <Cork> uhh...
[05:14:25] <bigbugjava> damn, sry channel
[05:14:30] <Cork> don't dump it in the channel
[05:14:35] <bigbugjava> I know
[05:14:43] <Cork> bigbugjava: load should only get partial content
[05:14:47] <bigbugjava> pressed b4 thinking, lol
[05:14:53] <Cork> make sure it doesn't contain full html pages
[05:15:01] <Fisher> Cork, you can find a jsfiddle producing the same result here: http://jsfiddle.net/jd69z/2/
[05:15:15] <bigbugjava> Cork pages/builder.html #whatever ?
[05:15:32] <Cork> ugg that is a LOT of code...
[05:16:13] <Cork> Fisher: where are the options you talk about?
[05:16:23] <bigbugjava> Cork what I wrote is what u meant?
[05:16:58] <Cork> bigbugjava: well yes you can give load selectors to try to hack around not doing server coding
[05:17:10] <Cork> bigbugjava: but really you should limit the content you send in stead
[05:17:26] <Cork> if you do it with .load you will waist A LOST of bandwidth
[05:17:57] <bigbugjava> Cork how should I do that then?
[05:18:13] <bigbugjava> it looked the most fast way
[05:18:17] <bigbugjava> *like
[05:18:31] <Cork> bigbugjava: have the server serv a resource that only contains the content you want in "article"
[05:18:48] <Cork> and if you want full pages too, have the server combine them
[05:19:04] <Cork> yes that means you need server scripting
[05:19:45] <bigbugjava> yeah I do that aswell
[05:20:06] <bigbugjava> it links to a html page that makes request to database then send html back
[05:20:23] <Fisher> Cork,  yeah sorry about that! The options are the radio buttons situated to the right side of "include under offer" check one of these and the values of the slider should change :S
[05:20:35] <bigbugjava> lets first test selectors
[05:22:54] <bigbugjava> Cork I add <div id ="container"> to all pages.. and it totally stoped working.. lol
[05:23:53] <bigbugjava> Cork If I add the #container , it means Javascript on that page wont load?
[05:24:03] <bigbugjava> only content?
[05:32:22] <Cork> bigkevmcd: it means it will only load the content of that element in the full page it loads
[05:32:34] <Cork> so yes the header section won't be inserted into the current page
[05:36:46] <bigbugjava> Cork mate?
[05:37:06] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[05:37:15] <Cork> bigbugjava: those two lines up there was for you
[05:37:26] <bigbugjava> I restart comptuter
[05:37:30] <bigbugjava> computer
[05:37:38] <Cork> <Cork> bigkevmcd: it means it will only load the content of that element in the full page it loads
[05:37:39] <Cork> <Cork> so yes the header section won't be inserted into the current page
[05:37:51] <ph88> with jQuery UI Drag and Drop  why is it so that you can get the draggable element code (after being dropped) in the droppable, but not the droppable in the draggable element code (after being dropped) ?
[05:38:13] <MoTiOnXml> anyone here using requireJS?
[05:38:27] <bigbugjava> Cork So how can I load it correctly... including all header+javascript(on button in my designs)
[05:38:43] * MoTiOnXml goes to #requirejs
[05:38:48] <Cork> bigbugjava: if you need to load full pages you need to stop using ajax
[05:38:54] <Cork> bigbugjava: cause that WILL break
[05:39:36] <bigbugjava> "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'modal"
[05:39:37] <Cork> bigbugjava: you should load the js you depend on from the page start, and then only run the js you need for the new html in the partials
[05:39:40] <bigbugjava> it's because Ajax?
[05:39:44] <Cork> no
[05:40:07] <Cork> it is cause you load js resources from the new page
[05:40:13] <Cork> and replace the js in your current page
[05:40:25] <Cork> and it most likely happen in the wrong order or without the needed plugin
[05:40:38] <bigbugjava> umm interesting..
[05:40:53] <Fisher> Another little question whilst i just try and work out this weird radio input changing the value of my slider range, is it possible for the slider to output "minimum" and "maximum" instead of the number value of 0 and the number value for my maximum
[05:42:18] <bigbugjava> Cork .. need to think on a way to solve modal issues
[05:42:26] <bigbugjava> you need to... J/K
[05:42:30] <bigbugjava> ;)
[05:42:33] <Cork> bigbugjava: when you load new content
[05:42:42] <Cork> just load the content you need; not full pages
[05:42:55] <bigbugjava> Cork: but I need JS with that load
[05:43:02] <Cork> then you would have to use iframes
[05:43:12] <Cork> so you can load full pages in isolated environments
[05:43:26] <bigbugjava> Cork: really? omg.. change complete site
[05:43:46] <Cork> bigbugjava: well i would argue you should extract the js from the pages instead
[05:43:47] <Dirkos> How can i get this to work? http://pastie.org/8495335
[05:44:19] <Cork> Dirkos: well you would have to use something that defines delayKeyup
[05:44:56] <bigbugjava> Cork I have main JS file.. but on click I need to excute something specific for that page
[05:45:13] <Cork> bigbugjava: sure that isn't a biggie
[05:45:21] <Cork> just don't load everything every time
[05:45:25] <bigbugjava> umm may be I load content and excute the javascript at the same time?
[05:45:44] <Dirkos> Cork: i have this? http://pastie.org/8495337
[05:45:58] <bigbugjava> good ideas, let me try to pull it together and fix these bugs, then I talk to you about add object to datatables lol
[05:46:05] <bigbugjava> you know anything about that ?
[05:46:05] <Cork> Dirkos: that is something completely different
[05:46:12] <Cork> Dirkos: that isn't an event it is a function
[05:46:26] <Dirkos> ok thnx but how can i get it to work? What should i do?
[05:46:30] <Cork> and it isn't constructed to handle delegated events either
[05:46:40] <Cork> for delegation; you would have to rewrite it
[05:48:32] <Cork> Dirkos: also why do you need delayed keyups?
[05:48:45] <Dirkos> i want to autosuggest but need a delay for it
[05:48:54] <Dirkos> Cork: else it will do a lookup on every keypress
[05:49:21] <Cork> well it would have to be rewritten
[05:49:35] <Cork> and i would recommend looking into $.event.special
[05:50:43] <bigbugjava> Cork I sparated JS and Content, still same issue
[05:51:28] <Dirkos> Cork: rewritten in what?
[05:51:42] <Cork> Dirkos: in a style where you base it around events
[05:51:50] <Cork> else you won't be able to handle delegated events; ever
[05:52:02] <Cork> like i said look into $.event.special
[05:52:25] <bigbugjava> if ya can take a look, http://jsfiddle.net/Nh9w4/
[05:53:00] <someone-noone> img.attr("src",window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));	this code successfully loads jpeg image from blob. Is it possible to notify when image will be loaded and displayed?	
[05:53:32] <Cork> someone-noone: you could try the onload event
[05:53:39] <someone-noone> thanks!
[05:53:59] <someone-noone> let me try it.
[05:55:45] <someone-noone> what is jquery equivalent? .ready() ?
[05:56:02] <Cork> img.load(function() {})
[05:57:13] <someone-noone> Cork, thanks! It works!
[06:03:31] <rccc> jquerymobile is it possible to override click on listview items ?
[06:05:44] <jop008> I have json.Parse on my page and an error on P what file is missing for json.parse?
[06:06:15] <BillCriswell> jop008: JSON.parse
[06:07:52] <BillCriswell> jop008: JSON.parse should be in your browser already. Unless you're using an old browser and loading a polyfill you're not missing any files.
[06:08:06] <jop008> strange
[06:08:24] <xec> IE in quirks mode will throw a hissy fit too
[06:09:31] <jop008> browsers throws this on console
[06:09:33] <jop008> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token P login.php:95
[06:09:34] <jop008> http.onreadystatechange
[06:09:41] <BillCriswell> jop008: jQuery has $.parseJSON(). I imagine that's the safest bet.
[06:09:43] <jop008> pointing to JSON.parse line
[06:09:46] <pixolin> I want to exclude an image from toggle() and provided an example of what I am trying to do at http://jsfiddle.net/2YM2J/
[06:10:12] <pixolin> my question is what i need to add to exclude the image so if someone click it, it doesn't toggle.
[06:10:26] <pixolin> clicks*
[06:11:14] <felixjet> how i do now a .live() ?
[06:11:36] <felixjet> i want to insert new items using jquery, but the new ones are not "bind" to document and they doesnt work
[06:11:48] <felixjet> i used .live() but its now deprecated
[06:11:54] <felixjet> and i dont know how to do with .on()
[06:11:59] <Bauer1> Cork: remember yesterday, I was using async: false? well I tried to modify it now to use complete: DoSecondPost(SingleObject) and complete: DoThirdPost(SingleObject) - but it doesnt always work, sometimes requests are getting cancelled, and I cant see any reason why were they cancelled
[06:12:03] <xec> pixolin: you could prevent bubbling http://jsfiddle.net/2YM2J/1/
[06:12:07] <felixjet> i tried with .on('DOMNodeInserted'
[06:12:12] <felixjet> but no sucessful
[06:12:19] <BillCriswell> pixolin: Many ways to approach that. You can use a ':not(img)' for the second parameter of the .on() or you can check out what the events target is.
[06:12:38] <xec> pixolin: or select only the other elements, or check if what you clicked is an image
[06:12:44] <Cork> Bauer1: most likely cause they timeout
[06:12:50] <Bauer1> Cork: if you click any of the right 4 blocks here: https://cloud.ccccloud.com/index.php - not always you would reach the checkout page
[06:12:58] <Cork> Bauer1: also not sure if i said this last time, but don't use async: false
[06:12:58] <pixolin> OK, OK, I see :) many ways to do it. Thank you very much.
[06:13:01] <airdem> i have 2 modal dialogs open. how can i prevent the first one getting to get on top of the econd one on click?
[06:13:08] <Cork> it will frees the page while the ajax call happens
[06:13:11] <Bauer1> Cork: that is exactly what I just tried to change, and its not working
[06:13:12] <airdem> *getting on top
[06:13:33] <Bauer1> not always working, to be percise
[06:13:48] <Cork> Bauer1: i can't take the time to dig through your full page, sorry
[06:14:26] <xec> pixolin: http://jsfiddle.net/2YM2J/2/
[06:14:32] <Bauer1> Cork: if I cant figure it out, I will be forced to revert to async: false :(
[06:15:02] <BillCriswell> pixolin: http://jsfiddle.net/2YM2J/3/
[06:15:02] <Cork> Bauer1: if you can reduce it to the parts you have problem with i might be able to help
[06:15:30] <pixolin> great, thanks a lot.
[06:15:36] <BillCriswell> pixolin: No problem.
[06:17:41] <pixolin> Hurray, works like a charm! Once more, thanks a lot. (Hope, my JavaScript Book arrives soon, really need to delve deeper into it.)
[06:18:55] <bigbugjava> Cork.. I Cant figure the right way
[06:19:13] <BillCriswell> You're welcome. http://eloquentjavascript.net/ is a good read.
[06:19:30] <bigbugjava> no stright foward tutorials for how to build it correctly, when you have JS inside of anypage
[06:21:36] <lucs> Hi folks.
[06:22:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi
[06:22:08] <lucs> The second code block on http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ says that it's "shorthand" for 'ready'.
[06:22:39] <lucs> How is that "shorthand"? It looks more like an "alternative".
[06:24:04] <Cork> lucs: $() is a big combination function
[06:24:04] <airdem> can you tell me how one can see all event that are bound to a html element in firebug?
[06:24:13] <Cork> it calls A LOT of different functions under the hood
[06:24:26] <airdem> *events
[06:24:33] <Cork> lucs: but it runs the exact same function, so yes it is a shorthand
[06:24:55] <Cork> lucs: just like $('selector') is a short hand for $(document).find('selector')
[06:25:17] <reuf> here is a simple example of javascript jqeury ajax call: http://bpaste.net/show/638EBRDfDQVuTE24dnfO/ - question - .done(function(data){...}); - the "data" where does the data part come from?
[06:25:36] <Cork> reuf: the ajax call
[06:25:43] <Cork> it is the data returned from the ajax call
[06:25:57] <lucs> Cork: Hmm... What I don't get is, in the example, it uses "console.log..." -- If it was something else, would it still be "shorthand" for ready?
[06:26:04] <Cork> reuf: if you mean the variable name, it is just a name
[06:26:34] <Velveeta> airdem: there's an internal function you can use to pull that info, but it may be going away in the future, $._data(element, 'events')
[06:26:49] <Cork> reuf: you can do .done(function(bob_is_my_uncle) { $('selector').html(bob_is_my_uncle); }); if you like
[06:27:15] <Velveeta> airdem: in that call, 'element' needs to be the actual dom node reference itself, not a jquery-wrapped version of it, so if you use jquery to get a handle to it, you'd need to then do something like this: $._data($('#myElement')[0], 'events')
[06:27:28] <Cork> airdem: also note that that list doesn't have to be complete
[06:27:39] <Cork> it is just the events that jquery happens to know about
[06:27:44] <Velveeta> good point
[06:27:45] <cannap> A question about datepicker jqueryui why is this not working? http://paste.laravel.com/192I i shows http://d.pr/i/YP3k
[06:27:59] <Cork> there is no way to query the browser about event listeners
[06:28:00] <airdem> is there any user friendly extension?
[06:28:00] <Velveeta> any that are registered outside of jquery's functions will not be present there, that only pulls from the jquery cache for that element
[06:28:19] <airdem> was hoping firebug could help
[06:28:37] <Velveeta> airdem: like i said, that is based on an internal function for jquery itself, which may be going away in the future, so it's unreliable to build an extension that does that
[06:28:49] <Velveeta> it used to be available via $(element).data('events') but they deprecated that
[06:28:53] <reuf> Cork: the data itself, it is filled with usefull data by someone up in the chain
[06:29:04] <lucs> Cork: Is the fact that the shorthand is writing precisely the string "ready!" to the console log what makes it work?
[06:29:07] <Velveeta> it looks like they're moving more towards encapsulating that away from the user, like the browser does
[06:29:16] <lucs> *that makes it work
[06:29:32] <Cork> lucs: no
[06:29:45] <Cork> but it checks if the first argument to $ is a function
[06:29:49] <airdem> Velveeta, thank you for the info
[06:29:53] <Velveeta> no problem
[06:30:04] <Cork> and if it is it runs $(document).ready(argument[0]); (basically
[06:30:07] <Cork> )
[06:30:18] <Cork> *arguments
[06:30:23] <Nomikos> what is the most common method to use jquery html template snippets? like if I need to dynamically show some products, where I only get the raw product data instead of blocks of html?
[06:30:23] <lucs> Cork: Ah! Making more sense to me now.
[06:30:52] <Nomikos> and is there a primer for dummies on that, somewhere >.>
[06:30:59] <Velveeta> i had a dream that i was a judge on one of those music "reality" shows, and i had to choose between depeche mode singing "ordinary world" and oingo boingo singing "skin"…. it was one of the toughest decisions i've ever been faced with in life...
[06:31:42] <Velveeta> nomikos: when you say jquery html template snippets, do you mean the jquery template plugin? because that's out of support as far as i know, and much slower than some more modern client-side templating libraries
[06:32:17] <Velveeta> if you mean just client-side templates in general, we use handlebars internally here… there are some that are faster, but this one provides a good mix of partial logic and extension functions, and is pretty snappy
[06:32:55] <BillCriswell> Dive Into Python is free online but $18 for the Amazong Kindle edition. I don't understand.
[06:33:27] <Velveeta> billcriswell: can you download ebooks outside of the amazon store on a kindle?
[06:33:38] <Velveeta> i'm gonna *guess* not.. and that would probably be the reason :D
[06:34:04] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Oh I can, but I'm like super fucking lazy.
[06:35:16] <Velveeta> can you just click on an epub or pdf link and have it download and open it in a reader on its own?
[06:35:32] <Velveeta> if so, i'm gonna point my kid's kindle at a site i keep chocked full of programming books :D
[06:36:36] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I can email a PDF to my kindle email address and it shows up just like a book. I never tried just navigating to one on the kindle and opening it.
[06:36:51] <Velveeta> you wanna try?
[06:37:27] <BillCriswell> I can give it a shot.
[06:37:46] <Velveeta> i just sent you a link
[06:37:50] <Nomikos> Velveeta: thanks, that looks good.
[06:38:12] <Velveeta> nomokos: no problem, and there's plenty of documentation and tutorials for handlebars online
[06:44:24] <Guest20878> I want to make an ajax call and send data by POST. well thats ok. but I have a form, it has the input fields and file upload /browse options.  it has a button of intput type button (not submit). How can I send the data by ajax when that button is pressed?  I mean how to pass the input fields and the file data to that ajax call method? the form of input and file brows with that button type="button" is separate and the ajax call method is sep
[06:44:24] <Guest20878> arate.  a function that's executed when the button is pressed . . how can the function read the fields?
[06:45:36] <Velveeta> so, you can send *most* of that data by ajax post by using a click handler on that button and passing $('form').serialize() as the data to your ajax function
[06:45:54] <Velveeta> however, that's not gonna work for your upload, you can't post files via ajax in most browsers
[06:46:03] <Guest20878> hm
[06:46:12] <Velveeta> i think they've come up with a file field that does allow for it, but it's not widely supported as far as i know
[06:46:27] <Velveeta> you'll probably have to look into some kind of ajax uploader plugin to handle that aspect of your form
[06:46:45] <Guest20878>  but it's not widely supported as far as i know < ------ thats for file fileld in    form?
[06:46:54] <felixjet> can someone help me please? :(
[06:47:01] <felixjet> im so stuck
[06:48:24] <Velveeta> file field with an ajax option for uploading
[06:48:56] <Velveeta> guest20878: http://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2010/07/30/html5-powered-ajax-file-uploads
[06:49:12] <Velveeta> felixjet: throw your question out there
[06:49:44] <felixjet> well, imagine a plugin that you call like $('.whatever').rainbows({});
[06:50:00] <felixjet> im adding more .whatever dinamically
[06:50:19] <felixjet> and they are not working because when the function executed, those elements were not in dom
[06:50:34] <felixjet> i used .live() time ago, but now is deprecated
[06:50:40] <felixjet> and i dont know how to do it with .on
[06:51:00] <felixjet> i tried wrapping that call inside a $(document).on('DOMNodeInserted', function() {}
[06:51:03] <Velveeta> felixjet: so, live has been replaced with .on, however, live never worked for plugins, it was strictly for attaching event listeners
[06:51:06] <felixjet> (just for the testing)
[06:51:12] <felixjet> and the browser freezes
[06:51:26] <felixjet> any idea on how i can fix this?
[06:51:52] <felixjet> i can modify the plugin, its not so big
[06:51:56] <Velveeta> if you have a plugin that you're looking to fire for dom nodes that don't exist in the document, there are only gonna be 2 ways that i can think of to do it
[06:51:58] <felixjet> but dunno what to do >.<
[06:52:07] <Cork> felixjet: that event is depricated, and not supported by many browsers
[06:52:13] <Velveeta> 1 is gonna be polling the dom and watching for them to show up, and that's expensive
[06:52:17] <Guest20878> Velveeta,   I just wanted to know that can I or is it sane to get form values (including the file value) and pass those to an ajax method. then do an ajax POST ?
[06:52:26] <felixjet> like a setTimeout, right?
[06:52:35] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  I cant have html5
[06:52:51] <Bernardao> felix y should use   $(document).on('click', '#your_div', function() {
[06:53:07] <Velveeta> yes, or a setInterval… 2 is gonna be if you know what code injects those elements, you can make that code either broadcast an event to trigger some callback that fires the plugin on them, or else you can just have that code fire the plugin on them directly
[06:53:27] <felixjet> Bernardao, but if i put the plugin call inside there, the browser freezes
[06:53:43] <Velveeta> guest20878: if you want wide browser support, then you can't ajax post that file upload… you can, however, ajax post all the rest of the form data
[06:53:57] <Bernardao> you want to call the plugin when a click occurs?
[06:54:21] <felixjet> no
[06:54:35] <Velveeta> actually, bernardao's onto something with that idea
[06:54:35] <Bernardao> on what event?
[06:54:36] <felixjet> i want to make the plugin work on new elements added dinamically
[06:54:36] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  hm. what browsers support ajax post of file data? multipart to be exact?
[06:54:45] <Velveeta> felixjet: how about you describe what this plugin is supposed to do
[06:54:55] <felixjet> https://github.com/simontabor/jquery-toggles/blob/master/toggles.js
[06:54:58] <Velveeta> guest20878: i'm not sure off the top of my head
[06:55:05] <felixjet> its a toggle replacer
[06:55:09] <felixjet> http://simontabor.com/labs/toggles/
[06:55:22] <felixjet> the problem is, that im adding new toggles dinamically
[06:55:25] <felixjet> and they doesnt work
[06:55:25] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  what are my alternatives to that (while not involving and third party lib)?
[06:55:39] <Velveeta> felixjet: so am i correct in thinking that thing only adds a click and a drag functionality to the elements in question?
[06:55:56] <felixjet> probably
[06:56:04] <Velveeta> guest20878: without involving 3rd party code, your only option for a reliable file upload is gonna be a standard non-ajax form post
[06:56:17] <Guest20878> hm
[06:56:45] <Velveeta> felixjet: then you could do something like this: modify that code to add a data parameter to the element whenever it's had that plugin instantiated on it
[06:56:59] <Bernardao> felix, can you copy the structure where you are adding the toogles?
[06:57:02] <Velveeta> and then add a mousedown listener at the document level to check for it, and if it doesn't exist, instantiate that plugin on it
[06:57:13] <felixjet> Bernardao, jsfiddle u mean?
[06:57:23] <felixjet> or if i can copy / clone the structure?
[06:57:26] <Bernardao> could help
[06:57:29] <felixjet> oh, wait
[06:57:33] <lintguy> Hello.
[06:57:36] <felixjet> maybe its not working because im using clone()
[06:57:44] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  ok, if i try the ajax thing and see if browsers support it. Is it sane (or it will work) if i just grab the input field value by id by JS or jQuery    from that form and pass it to some ajax method?
[06:57:56] <Velveeta> something like this: $(document).on('mousedown', '.someClass', function () { if (!$(this).data('toggleAdded')) { $(this).toggles().data('toggleAdded', true);} });
[06:58:01] <felixjet> and im cloning a working toggle, already replaced by the plugin
[06:58:08] <lintguy> I'm trying to make a page makro, by injecting a script. But i get undefined on an item chain and i just cannot understand why: http://pastebin.com/0NQy25Mk
[06:58:15] <Velveeta> guest20878: i'm pretty sure that doesn't work for ajax-posting file data
[06:59:09] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  doesn't work for ajax-posting file data  or doesnt works for passing file data to a JS method?
[06:59:30] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[07:00:33] <Bloomberg> someone here has worked with mpdf?
[07:00:38] <Velveeta> guest20878: doesn't work for ajax-posting file data, i'm not sure what kind of js method you're trying to pass the file data to in the 2nd half of that question
[07:01:21] <serAphim> i got a $("#divId").on("click","a",...). problem is when i load something inside the div and do a $("#newDivId").on("click","a"...) the event is there twice (of course). #divId and #newDivId contain a random string, so i can't just .off it. is there a way to find out if the event is already bound to a parent?
[07:01:29] <seutje> lintguy: does it lint?
[07:02:06] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  this type of http://jsfiddle.net/SQesc/
[07:02:13] <Cork> serAphim: not really, it is normally best to add the event listeners statically
[07:02:17] <felixjet> Velveeta, i got it fixed!
[07:02:22] <Cork> serAphim: that way you don't need to wonder
[07:02:25] <felixjet> i was inserting it doing clone
[07:02:33] <felixjet> so i cloned the result of the plugin
[07:02:35] <felixjet> not the trigger
[07:02:42] <serAphim> Cork: ok, thanks
[07:02:43] <Velveeta> felixjet: nice :)
[07:02:45] <felixjet> i changed it
[07:02:52] <lintguy> seutje: Yes, no outstanding errors.
[07:02:59] <felixjet> and added a $('.toggle').toggles({})
[07:03:05] <felixjet> below the appendTo
[07:03:09] <seutje> lintguy: odd, just tried it and it gave up after 1%
[07:03:13] <felixjet> and the new ones are working
[07:03:19] <felixjet> is that a good solution?
[07:03:29] <felixjet> the toggles() is executing on each new item added
[07:03:37] <felixjet> each time i mean
[07:03:48] <lintguy> seutje: I linted using this http://www.jslint.com/
[07:03:50] <Velveeta> guest20878: i'm not sure if you can reference the file field's value in that function or not, it's been a while since i mucked with file fields in js… i do know that most, if not all, browsers have securtiy in place to prevent you from programmatically *setting* the value of a file field, but i'm not sure about reading it… if you do read it, you'll only be reading the name of the file in that field though, not the contents of it
[07:04:32] <Velveeta> felixjet: so the only issue i can think of that you might have with that solution is that it may be double-and triple-binding your event listeners
[07:04:51] <Guest20878> k
[07:04:52] <Velveeta> because for each new .toggle, you're grabbing all .toggle elements and firing the plugin on them, whether they've already been triggered or not
[07:05:23] <Velveeta> so if that function doesn't do any kind of checking to see if those listeners have already been bound up, it'll bind them again and again
[07:05:54] <felixjet> but i can fix it with $(this.find('.toggle')).toggle()
[07:05:56] <felixjet> right?
[07:06:00] <felixjet> this = appended one
[07:06:21] <Cork> $(this).find('.toggle')
[07:06:41] <felixjet> no, because "this" is already an object
[07:06:43] <Velveeta> guest20878: here's a matrix for the xhr2 objects that allow for file uploads, so you can see what kind of support you're looking at cross-browser: http://caniuse.com/xhr2
[07:06:52] <Cork> felipe`: then you don't need $() at all there
[07:07:26] <felixjet> ill try it
[07:07:46] <joroci> so do you know any good scrollbars like mCustomScrollbar or perfect scrollbar?
[07:07:51] <ishox> Hi, perhaps somebody can help me, i would like to use .load() but it doesn't work on I.E, i don't find trick for this on the web so, somebody have an idea please ?
[07:08:07] <Velveeta> ishox: .load() for the document or for images?
[07:08:15] <Cork> joroci: scrollbar replacements tend to be problematic
[07:08:23] <ishox> for a php script
[07:08:35] <Cork> joroci: cause you have to be careful with all the different systems the page will load on
[07:08:47] <Cork> joroci: and it if VERY easy to break a system if you don't cater for it
[07:09:06] <Velveeta> ishox: jquery.load is a javascript function, you can't use it with a php script.. if you mean the document that's output to the browser, then yes you can, but are you talking about using .load to track the loaded state of the page itself, or an image in the page?
[07:09:26] <lintguy> seutje: I don't get it, everything seems to work except it reports undefined for item at //insert object console.log(item)
[07:09:49] <Velveeta> cork joroci: we used to have custom scrollbars on some of our widgets here, and they were definitely problematic, especially when combined with custom mouse cursor images.. we decided to fallback to native and styling them where it was supported
[07:10:12] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  thats the support for file data upload by ajax? looks like only Opera Mini  dont suport it
[07:10:23] <Velveeta> guest20878: and ie < 10
[07:10:42] <Guest20878> ya
[07:10:58] <Velveeta> so it depends on what browser support you need
[07:11:13] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  one important question is also that can i get and pass the file data from form field to ajax method?
[07:11:16] <Velveeta> we personally have to support back to IE7, which sucks, but even if we could drop that, and 8, 9 still doesn't support it
[07:11:44] <ishox> Velveeta: yes i know, it's in order to load an object no an image, it's work on moz,chrome, and other but IE don't load because it seems have a cache
[07:12:01] <Velveeta> guest20878: no, you cannot get the file contents data and pass it to an ajax method, if you read the form field value, it will only give you the filename of the intended upload
[07:12:24] <Velveeta> ishox: what object are you talking about?
[07:12:39] <Velveeta> there's no load method for javascript objects, they're created the instant you define them...
[07:12:58] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  then I CANNOT send the file data by ajax? end of story?
[07:13:36] <Velveeta> guest20878: if you look at the article i posted for you a while back, it demonstrates the xhr2 method of uploading
[07:13:45] <ishox> a php object with data, i change it with ajax() first and want to reload it with new information on the same page, i use .load for that
[07:13:55] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  yes. and?
[07:14:07] <joroci> look at it;)
[07:14:08] <Velveeta> and *that's* how you ajax upload a file
[07:14:33] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  this one? http://caniuse.com/xhr2
[07:14:43] <Velveeta> no, this one: http://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2010/07/30/html5-powered-ajax-file-uploads
[07:14:52] <Velveeta> caniuse only shows browser support for xhr2
[07:14:53] <Guest20878> k
[07:17:46] <ishox> Anyhow, .load() don't work on Internet explorer, are there a trick for that ?
[07:19:15] <seutje> ishox: tried not using the shorthand?
[07:19:31] <Velveeta> ishox: so, a php object has no place in the browser, it may originate from php, but the browser doesn't care about it until it's part of the document, and at that point, it doesn't care if it came from php, rails, asp.net, or anything else… so you have this javascript object in your page, and then make an ajax call back to php to modify the object on the server side, and want to reload the information in the page? i'm assuming without a refresh?
[07:20:44] <seutje> ishox: erm, load is meant for loading markup
[07:21:03] <Guest20878> Velveeta,   thanks for the support!!
[07:21:16] <Velveeta> guest20878: no problem, did you get it working?
[07:21:35] <ishox> Yes a refresh of course but it's not my purpose, it's on checkout e-commerce website, people change shipping etc information in ajax directly, and when they want to pay, the object must be reload with good informations, .load() work perfectly but not on IE .... ... .. .
[07:22:18] <ThoMe> hihoi
[07:22:20] <seutje> ishox: $.fn.load implicitly expects HTML to be returned: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/99c123b159e85ab9d97bea65a5ec4fff62023bf9/src/ajax/load.js#L18
[07:22:37] <lucs> Cork: Thanks for the 'ready' shorthand clarification, and have a nice day!
[07:22:40] <seutje> ishox: also, busting cache is as easy as appending a timestamp
[07:22:56] <Velveeta> ishox: you should return the updated information from your ajax request that updates the information, and use a success handler to inject that into the document or page-level object somewhere
[07:23:21] <seutje> yeah, that seems reasonable
[07:23:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> jedimind: you around?
[07:23:28] <Velveeta> oh you're using *that* load method
[07:23:31] <ThoMe> i use $(".changeDeviceUriForm").overlay({ and I would like the id from the "tr" which i clicked
[07:23:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: what up
[07:23:34] <ThoMe>  $(this).closest('tr').attr('id');
[07:23:36] <ThoMe> is it wrong?
[07:23:41] <seutje> yeah, it's for swapping out markup
[07:23:51] <seutje> but he won't listen to me :(
[07:23:54] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: nada, getting close to having to get started on my day, gutting an existing widget of ours and rebuilding from the ground up
[07:23:54] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: It's not wrong if this is what you think it is.
[07:24:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: love building stuff ground up so much less to worry aobut
[07:24:30] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: hm. i think "this" is from overlay({. i need the current <tr>
[07:24:53] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: Do console.log( this ); and if it's the element you think it is that should work.
[07:25:14] <Velveeta> .overlay is also not an event listener, so there's no 'this' context to catch in a click function
[07:25:32] <Velveeta> unless .overlay adds a click event listener to the tr's under that container or something
[07:25:34] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: <tr id="tm"><class="changeDeviceUriForm">DeviceUriChange</a></td></tr> <<this is my html. my javascriopt. $(".changeDeviceUriForm").overlay({
[07:25:55] <ThoMe> Velveeta: can you help me with the tricker?
[07:26:12] <Velveeta> thome: i'm not sure what 'overlay' is, is there a jsfiddle you can whip up with an example?
[07:26:33] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: I believe yesterday he said "Its secret"
[07:26:47] <ThoMe> Velveeta: have this http://jquerytools.org/demos/overlay/
[07:26:49] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: hihi :-)
[07:26:50] <lasha> any cool solutions for preloading images dynamically?
[07:27:09] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: http://paste.keks.be/447
[07:27:19] <Velveeta> lasha: is it from a fixed list of images?
[07:27:51] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  iam going for the non ajax one. to make things simple for now
[07:27:53] <BillCriswell> ThoMe: Do console.log(this) and see what this is.
[07:28:13] <Velveeta> guest20878: gotcha, good luck
[07:28:21] <Guest20878> thx
[07:30:01] <ishox> thx guys i will try to find something else
[07:30:21] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/iyEfuzeZ/1/
[07:30:26] <Bloomberg> I have this Guys!!
[07:30:59] <Bloomberg> I'm working with PHP and the url is a function that generates a pdf file
[07:31:13] <Bloomberg> but doesn't open it
[07:31:25] <Bloomberg> I already test it with $.post and nothing
[07:31:34] <ThoMe> BillCriswell: in this i nothing. hmm.
[07:31:51] <ThoMe> only the modal overlay.
[07:32:03] <lasha> i'm looking for a dynamic preloader! one where i dont have to manually pass image paths. it just finds it in the html itself….
[07:32:07] <lasha> help?
[07:32:14] <Velveeta> bloomberg: you're telling it to receive back a dataType of 'json', that isn't gonna open any pdf file
[07:32:51] <Bloomberg> So what type will works
[07:33:12] <Velveeta> lasha: can you give us some examples of what you're talking about? are these background images or hover-state images or something? or just straight up img tags?
[07:33:47] <ThoMe> Velveeta / BillCriswell now :-)
[07:33:58] <ThoMe> Velveeta / BillCriswell: var triggers = $(".changeDeviceUriForm").overlay({ and  var printerName = triggers.eq(0).closest('tr').attr('id');
[07:34:02] <ThoMe> perfecto.
[07:34:10] <ThoMe> Velveeta: gracias
[07:34:43] <Velveeta> bloomberg: if you're trying to generate a pdf and have it load in the browser, you're gonna want to either return consumable html that you can inject into the page that has an <object> or <embed> tag, or else return a json object that has the filename info, and manually construct that kind of thing, or else have the url to the generated pdf file and programmatically redirect the user to that url on success
[07:34:58] <Velveeta> thome: i didn't do much for your problem, but you're welcome :)
[07:35:24] <BillCriswell> I still have no idea what's going on.
[07:36:16] <Guest20878> how to reset all values of a form to empty?
[07:36:28] <Velveeta> guest20878: form.reset()
[07:36:31] <Guest20878> can we do it in one go or by steps for each field
[07:36:36] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  oh ok
[07:36:53] <Velveeta> now, that'll only reset it to empty if that's the load-state of the form itself i'm pretty sure
[07:37:09] <BillCriswell> Guest20878: $(':input').val('');
[07:37:11] <Velveeta> if you have something like php pre-populating those fields with previously-entered data or something, it won't empty them, it'll reset them to that state
[07:37:15] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[07:37:21] <BillCriswell> That seems dangerous.
[07:37:24] <BillCriswell> Oh well.
[07:37:25] <Velveeta> so you'd have to do something like billcriswell just said if you specifically want them emptied
[07:38:19] <jost> How can I check if an element has a descendants that match each of a set of selectors? Something like "match an element with id 'foo', but only if it has at least one descendant with class 'bar' and one with class 'baz'". The "and" is the tricky part, or would be easy...
[07:38:28] <Velveeta> lasha: you keep asking questions and then not responding when i attempt to help you
[07:38:49] <lasha> Bloomberg: you want client side pdf generstion? look at this http://parall.ax/products/jspdf
[07:38:58] <lasha> found that last night
[07:39:09] <jost> #foo:not(has(:not(.bar), :not(.baz))) maybe...?
[07:39:23] <lasha> also, Velveeta, image tags.
[07:39:25] <Velveeta> jost: you'd have to do it in 2 different selectors, there's no way to 'and' multiple separate descendents in a single selector
[07:39:59] <Bloomberg> lasha: honestly I'm working with mpdf
[07:40:11] <jost> Velveeta: maybe with the double negation, I'll try that
[07:40:26] <Bloomberg> And if I put this window.open('function_to_pdf') works ok
[07:40:47] <Velveeta> lasha: so, img tags will load their own content automatically, you're not really gonna see any performance increase by preloading them… also, to preload them, you'd have to stick the script tag in the head, which has no data about anything in the body because it hasn't been written out to the page yet
[07:40:52] <Bloomberg> The problem start when I need to pass several variables to function and this don'w allow me
[07:41:24] <lasha> Velveeta: there are methods around that
[07:41:58] <Velveeta> lasha: sure, you could use document.ready or something and then scrape the dom for img tags, but you're not gonna get any performance increase that way, because the img tags themselves will have already started loading their data automatically
[07:42:24] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  BillCriswell  this should do for all fields  $('#task-creation-form').children('form').reset();
[07:42:30] <Velveeta> preloading images is typically only used for old-style mouseovers images when people used to swap out the img src on an element, instead of putting that stuff into their css
[07:42:43] <lasha> Velveeta: its not for perf reasons, but presentation moreso
[07:42:46] <Guest20878> i have a form  inside the div #task-creation-form
[07:43:01] <Velveeta> lasha: or are you talking about something like loading thumbnails into the page and rendering full-sized images in a lightbox popup or something, and saving the load-time on the full sized images?
[07:44:03] <lasha> Velveeta: say you have 50 thumbs on a page, thats it.
[07:44:07] <Velveeta> also, i lost jost somewhere in this, so i'll throw out another response to him, you can also use a filter on your matched elements to do a 2-stage selector
[07:44:19] <BillCriswell> Guest20878: Calling reset on a form sets the fields to the state when the page was loaded. A reset does not empty all the fields.
[07:44:25] <Velveeta> lasha: so you have 50 thumbs on a page and want to load the 50 full-sized images so they're ready to go when someone wants to see the full thing?
[07:44:37] <lasha> you load the page and it has a throbber until thjumbs finish loadimg
[07:44:59] <lasha> no full size anything
[07:45:05] <Velveeta> ahhhhhhh ok now i see what you're doing
[07:45:25] <Velveeta> so, this is where deferred objects are a beautiful thing, i actually wrote a facebook post for something similar a couple years back
[07:45:50] <jost> Velveeta: a two-stage selector would be not nice in my current setup, but it would work
[07:46:31] <Velveeta> there was a case where someone wanted to make a div the same height as a sibling div that held thumbnails, and at document.ready, they'd set the height programmatically equal to the div with all the thumbs, but they weren't finished loading, so them that container would stretch as it finished loading them, and be out of sync with the sibling container, so he needed a way to know when the thumbs themselves finished loading, and *then* set the height equal t
[07:46:32] <Velveeta> that container
[07:47:51] <Velveeta> so the way we accomplished it was to have each image on the page have a bound .data() property for a deferred object, and a load handler that resolved that deferred object
[07:48:16] <Velveeta> then we stored all of those deferreds in an array, and passed that array to $.when with the .apply method, and nested that inside of document.ready
[07:48:25] <jost> Velveeta: this selector works: #foo:not(:not(:has(.bar)), :not(:has(.baz)))  -  de'morgan is the rulez :-)
[07:48:37] <Velveeta> so the callback on that $.when would only execute when all images had finished loading and resolved their deferred objects
[07:48:47] <BillCriswell> lasha: Are you familiar with progressive jpgs?
[07:49:23] <Velveeta> jost: that selector will match on *either* of those 2 conditions though, not *both*
[07:49:32] <lasha> BillCriswell: yes what about them
[07:49:45] <Velveeta> so it will match an element that doesn't have .bar *or* doesn't have .baz, but not one that doesn't have *both* .bar and .baz
[07:50:16] <jost> Velveeta: and the result of that is then negated again
[07:50:46] <jost> not(not(a) or not(b)) = a and b, by de'morgans rule
[07:50:51] <Velveeta> jost: ahhhh i see
[07:50:54] <Velveeta> nicely done
[07:51:24] <Bloomberg> what function will works for me for to replace the ( window.open() ) where I can to pass data
[07:51:36] <Bloomberg> For example like $.post or $.ajax
[07:52:15] <Velveeta> bloomberg: you just want to load that pdf in the current window right?
[07:52:24] <Guest20878> BillCriswell,  hm.. when the page was loaded. the fields were empty i gues
[07:52:27] <Velveeta> do you want the pdf to take over the window, or be embedded in the page that's in the current window?
[07:52:34] <Bloomberg> no problem if is in a new window
[07:52:45] <Bloomberg> I just need to open that pdf file with mpdf plugin
[07:52:53] <BillCriswell> lasha: When you use progressive the width and height are available a lot faster.
[07:52:56] <Bloomberg> now only works with window.open
[07:53:32] <Velveeta> bloomberg: well i have no idea what the mpdf plugin is, but if you just want it to redirect to the pdf as it's generated, you can just do a window.location.href = <path to generate and push your pdf out to the browser>;
[07:53:45] <BillCriswell> lasha: Actually, let me read up on it some more. I could be wrong.
[07:54:02] <lasha> BillCriswell: dont really need dimensions, i dont think
[07:54:10] <BillCriswell> http://blog.patrickmeenan.com/2013/06/progressive-jpegs-ftw.html
[07:54:19] <Velveeta> lasha: you just wanna mask the thumbnail area until everything is loaded visually?
[07:54:38] <lasha> BillCriswell: basically.
[07:55:07] <Bloomberg> Velveeta: but like this how can I pass data
[07:55:15] <Bloomberg> I need to pass ana array with keys and info
[07:55:19] <Velveeta> bloomberg: you'd have to pass them in the url
[07:55:35] <Velveeta> conversely, you could do an ajax post with that data, and on success, redirect the browser to the url of the generated pdf
[07:56:29] <Velveeta> lasha: here's a plugin that appears to be for detecting when images are loaded, whether they're from an asset request, or the browser cache, or whatever: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[07:57:57] <Velveeta> it uses the same kind of deferred methodology i was describing, but abstracts that away so you just have to worry about a single function call and attach your callback to the returned promise object
[07:58:34] <Velveeta> it even adds a notify emitter as each image is loading so that you can display a progress bar or something, 100% / number of images, and update the progress on each notify
[07:59:20] <lasha> does it auto loop through img elements?
[08:00:13] <Velveeta> lasha: looks like it, you just give it the container your images are in, and it will tell you when all images in that container are loaded
[08:00:22] <Velveeta> so you should be able to just run it against 'body' as the container
[08:00:33] <Fernandos> hi
[08:01:00] <Fernandos> Is there a websocket library/plugin with polyfills for non-compliant browsers that you can recommend?
[08:01:22] <Fernandos> The spec is changing too often and it's annoying to keep up with it for all browsers.
[08:01:24] <lasha> Velveeta: OOOooooooooooooooo
[08:02:07] <lasha> Velveeta: not surprised this is from the masonry/isotope guy
[08:02:29] <Velveeta> it's also the paul-irish-recommended plugin for that sort of thing :)
[08:05:48] <BillCriswell> Was he one of the original mootools guys?
[08:06:13] <BillCriswell> Eh, wrong guy.
[08:08:47] <aracodex123> Hi all, I'm wondering if any of you can help me with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20100877/jquery-sortable-with-multiple-drag-handle
[08:10:22] <MalMen> hello, i have $.getJSON and right after that i continue the code, but the code dont wait to $.getJSON be complete, is that normal ?
[08:10:53] <Velveeta> malmen: yes, getJSON is an async function
[08:11:20] <Velveeta> you need to either pass a success callback to it to handle the rest of your code that's dependent on its response, or you need to attach a .done() callback to its return to do the same thing
[08:11:29] <Guest20878> well, I am in a form but want the div #id of the parent(s) of the form to go as just like it was an input form field value.. Is it possible?
[08:12:45] <MalMen> Velveeta i dont get it 100%
[08:12:53] <kantlivelong> hey all.. im trying to convert an input text to a textarea. i cannot figure out how to preserve the line breaks (they can be see in source). is this possible?
[08:13:12] <Velveeta> guest20878: if you're doing a standard form post at this point, you could have a document.ready callback that injects a hidden input into the form with the name of the div container's id, so that it posts with the form
[08:13:23] <MalMen> the problem is that i need to get content from 2 getJSON, and only after that i can continue the code
[08:13:35] <Z3R0> quick question... if I have <a href="" onclick="function()" data-id="x"> does function() know $(this) to be the <a> tag?
[08:13:55] <Z3R0> or do I need to target a class name
[08:13:57] <MalMen> it is not possible to "tell" getJSON to dont do the rest of code until is done ?
[08:13:58] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  <input type="hidden" value="$(this).parents('.someClass').first()" />
[08:14:29] <Guest20878> ?
[08:15:31] <Velveeta> guest20878: you'd have to do something like $('form').each(function () { $(this).append('<input type="hidden" name="' + $(this.parents('.someClass').attr('id') + '" />'); });
[08:15:56] <Velveeta> malmen: depends on what version of jquery you're running, the async: false property has been deprecated in favor of using the promise callbacks
[08:16:28] <Velveeta> z3ro: if you put a function in the onclick handler like that, 'this' is gonna be the window object
[08:16:36] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  am.. nice but no way to write it inside the form itself and get the value of its parent?
[08:17:19] <Velveeta> guest20878: nope, if you set that as its value, it's gonna take that literal string as its value, the 'value' property doesn't interpret itself via js
[08:17:34] <Guest20878> hm
[08:17:38] <Guest20878> ok
[08:18:31] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  how about (despite in a POST form)  i do  action=someurl.com?parent=$(this).parents('.someClass').first()
[08:18:31] <Velveeta> malmen: here's a writeup on jquery's ajax promises and attaching callbacks to them: http://www.bitstorm.org/weblog/2012-1/Deferred_and_promise_in_jQuery.html
[08:18:32] <Guest20878> ?
[08:19:17] <Velveeta> guest20878: the only things that are going to be interpreted via js are gonna be on<event> event attribute properties, things like action and value are gonna take those as literal strings
[08:19:27] <Velveeta> and adding on<event> attributes is bad practice
[08:21:02] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  yes. but the above that I said is non JS
[08:21:33] <Velveeta> i'm not sure i understand that statement
[08:23:28] <Guest20878> action=someurl.com?parent=$(this).parents('.someClass').first()     method=post
[08:24:00] <Guest20878> ?something=434&Something=434  is a GET tradition
[08:24:01] <b-ot> Guest20878: memorised “something=434&Something=434”.
[08:24:02] <Velveeta> right, that's not going to evaluate as javascript, it's going to evaluate as that literal string of text and try to post your form to that url
[08:24:21] <Guest20878> oh. sorry
[08:24:22] <Guest20878> got it
[08:26:14] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  then your approach is best.  $('form').each(function () { $(this).append('<input type="hidden" name="' + $(this.parents('.someClass').attr('id') + '" />'); });
[08:26:40] <Velveeta> that *should* work, and just do it once, at load time
[08:27:36] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  am.. well complexity comes..   I am creating  parents by creating them by dom elements on the live page too.             so putting the above said in document.ready will only be applied to the  parents that were loaded on page load
[08:27:36] <TheEternalAbyss_> nick TheEternalAbyss
[08:27:39] <TheEternalAbyss_> oops
[08:27:54] * TheEternalAbyss_ blinks
[08:28:00] <TheEternalAbyss_> how can my nick be in use??
[08:28:08] <jedimind> you might be connected somewhere else?
[08:28:10] <Guest20878> not for the ones those were created after wards
[08:29:54] <TheEternalAbyss_> anyhow... quick question... if I'm selecting an element to change it's css properties.. it's like $("#foo").css({"border":"1px solid red");          right?
[08:30:07] <Velveeta> guest20878: so put that in its own named function and call it once at document.ready, with the context of all forms that exist at the time, and then each time you add a new one, do the same thing for that new form
[08:30:22] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  I would need some  .on(click, form) thing
[08:30:33] <TheEternalAbyss_> er i mean $("#foo").css({"border":"1px solid red")};
[08:30:42] <Velveeta> guest20878: if you could make a jsfiddle out of that, it'd probably be more helpful
[08:31:07] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: yes, that would work, if that's your question.. not sure if you're building up to another question or not
[08:31:17] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  my page is VERY complex. let me see what I can do and get back to you.    Is the .on approach sane too?
[08:31:21] <TheEternalAbyss_> well it's not working that's the problem
[08:31:27] <Velveeta> you'll change its inline styles, by the way, not its actual external css styles
[08:31:32] <TheEternalAbyss_> says $(...) is null
[08:32:03] <Velveeta> guest20878: i'm not sure, it depends on how you're adding those forms dynamically
[08:32:09] <TheEternalAbyss_> oh it changes inline?..... well It's fine I suppose..
[08:32:12] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: that sounds like a bad selector
[08:32:39] <TheEternalAbyss_> but it's <div id="foo"></div>
[08:32:52] <TheEternalAbyss_> i mean... it's not any more basic than that..
[08:33:13] <TheEternalAbyss_> hmm
[08:33:23] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  iam adding them like $(something).append(html here)
[08:33:23] <Velveeta> and is that function wrapped in a document.ready?
[08:33:55] <TheEternalAbyss_> i don't understand how my primary nick is connected to freenode.....
[08:34:02] <TheEternalAbyss_> i have NO other irc client connected
[08:34:15] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: message it and see if you get a response, could be someone else
[08:34:47] <Velveeta> guest20878: you'd want to take that function that injects the hidden input, and make it into a named function, and call it with .call(), passing your forms as the context of it, then loop over this.each() to do the element injection
[08:35:08] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  k
[08:35:28] <Velveeta> then in your function that adds forms dynamically, you can create your html and store it off as a jquery object, append it to your $(something), and then call your injection function and pass *that* jquery object as its scope with .call(), and it will do the same thing
[08:35:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: TheEternalAbyss_ problem happens to me when i randomly get disconnected from nternet
[08:35:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: welcome back bt
[08:35:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> *btw
[08:35:52] <Guest20878> theres only one form Velveeta  , that is used for each parent
[08:35:59] <TheEternalAbyss_> Rohan_Bhangui: yea but I wasn't connected at all... for days..
[08:36:00] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: same here, but it sounds like that's the first time he's connecting today
[08:36:10] <TheEternalAbyss_> Rohan_Bhangui: ty btw
[08:36:23] <Velveeta> guest20878: now you've lost me, that's why i said a jsfiddle example would make this much easier
[08:36:33] <Velveeta> so i can see how your markup is actually constructed and what you're actually trying to do
[08:36:43] <Guest20878> :) let me see and show you and get back
[08:36:56] <TheEternalAbyss_> well, let me show you my codepen.. maybe that can help solve my selector problem
[08:37:10] <Velveeta> that'll work
[08:37:19] <TheEternalAbyss_> http://codepen.io/anon/hvCzx
[08:37:37] <TheEternalAbyss_> oh wtf..
[08:37:44] <TheEternalAbyss_> oops
[08:37:51] <TheEternalAbyss_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hvCzx
[08:37:54] <TheEternalAbyss_> there
[08:38:30] <TheEternalAbyss_> what would the kill command be for irc? I'll try to kill the imposter/ghost id
[08:38:45] <jedimind> TheEternalAbyss_ did you auth?
[08:38:56] <TheEternalAbyss_> yes I did
[08:39:03] <jedimind> you have to auth yourself with nickserv
[08:39:11] <jedimind> then do /msg nickserv ghost TheEternalAbyss
[08:39:15] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  ok, one simple question. can I set the value of an existing (hardcoded) hidden form input filed by jQuery ?
[08:39:39] <Velveeta> guest20878: yep
[08:39:44] <Guest20878> am. how?
[08:39:51] <Velveeta> same way you would for any other form element
[08:39:56] <Guest20878> ok
[08:39:57] <Velveeta> $('selector').val(value)
[08:40:00] <Guest20878> got it
[08:40:45] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: i'm getting js errors on that page, but off the top of my head, i only see 2 pieSlice id'd elements, and you're trying to loop through 50 of them
[08:41:21] <TheEternalAbyss_> ..no...i'm trying to change the css of 1 of them 50 times..
[08:41:28] <TheEternalAbyss_> :\
[08:41:44] <Velveeta> oh boy… that's no good :D
[08:41:44] <TheEternalAbyss_> i'm trying to make a progress bar/ring
[08:41:51] <TheEternalAbyss_> lol
[08:42:05] <TheEternalAbyss_> so how would you update the css dynamically
[08:42:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss_: got idea: create a gif a small one and then repeat background
[08:42:24] <TheEternalAbyss_> cause essentially that's all i would need to do
[08:42:40] <TheEternalAbyss_> Rohan_Bhangui: I want a dynamic progress bar
[08:42:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> dynamic?
[08:42:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[08:42:52] <Velveeta> there's a purely transitional way of doing this in raw css if you're just trying to make a spinner
[08:42:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you wanna rotate that
[08:43:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> use transform
[08:43:05] <Velveeta> oh i see, it's a circular progress bar
[08:43:07] <TheEternalAbyss_> I want more than just spinner
[08:43:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> and use keyframes
[08:43:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> what laoding text that flashes?
[08:43:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well blinks
[08:44:33] <kantlivelong> is it possible to edit rendered HTML on the fly? i have an input field that has multi line data. converting to a textarea loses the newline breaks. My only thought is to replace the HTML itself to preserve the value area with newline breaks.
[08:45:22] <TheEternalAbyss_> no, no loading text/flashing text
[08:46:36] <TheEternalAbyss_> Velveeta: you'll have to explain to me why jquery thinks I'm trying to iterate through 50 divs, when I'm trying to just select the same one over and over
[08:46:49] <aracodex123> hey guys, can anyone assist me with this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20100877/jquery-sortable-with-multiple-drag-handle
[08:46:51] <Velveeta> no, you were right, i was misreading it when i said that
[08:47:19] <TheEternalAbyss_> oh..
[08:50:50] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: so, here's an example of your code just using a setInterval to increment the rotate transform, instead of that ajax call, which was failing in codepen: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hjJcf
[08:50:58] <Velveeta> however, it's not rotating anything
[08:52:38] <TheEternalAbyss_> hmm interesting
[08:53:13] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  click "attach file"  http://jsfiddle.net/t23FP/
[08:53:14] <Velveeta> and if you have painting rectangles turned on, you can see the painting area growing and shrinking while it paints the transform
[08:53:23] <Velveeta> guest20878: ok, just a minute
[08:54:31] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  wait. this one. http://jsfiddle.net/t23FP/1/
[08:55:28] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: ok i see why it's not showing rotation, that's a full light-blue circle, you're just clipping half of it from visibility
[08:55:30] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  looks like it works
[08:55:43] <Velveeta> so it *is* rotating, but it's just showing the full light-blue circle rotated through the clipping area
[08:56:30] <Velveeta> guest20878: i don't see an 'attach file' option
[08:57:00] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  Attach file  hyperlink   . the 4th one
[08:57:03] <Guest20878> under "abc"
[08:57:11] <TheEternalAbyss_> not really clipping it per se
[08:57:17] <Velveeta> oh wait now i see it
[08:57:25] <TheEternalAbyss_> i just have the overlay to make it look like a ring
[08:57:50] <TheEternalAbyss_> pie1 is the right half and tansform property increase the slice size
[08:58:07] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss_: you have a clip: rect(0px, 50px, 100px, 0px), which is a clipping mask
[08:58:13] <aracodex123> 'hey all, is it possible for the jQuery sortable() function to use different handles for different effects? 1 for single drag-drop, the other for multiple drag-drop ?
[08:58:27] <TheEternalAbyss_> oh yea that helps make the pie slice
[08:58:28] <Velveeta> aracodex123: not natively i'm pretty sure
[08:58:34] <TheEternalAbyss_> sorry forgot about that
[08:59:23] <Velveeta> so pie1 is just a full circle in a solid color, by rotating it w/ that transform, you're not gonna see any difference in the browser
[08:59:31] <aracodex123> Velveeta: yeah, I've been struggling with it, I basically need 2 handles, so when users use one of the handles, it drags only 1, but when user use the other handle, it "intelligently" drags a few related items
[08:59:42] <TheEternalAbyss_> is there a command for me to see how long a nick has been connected to freenode?
[08:59:43] <aracodex123> is there a way to do this?
[09:00:30] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  looks like fine.  but I hope 1) its correct way of doing things while I have many TASKs dives and some might be created on the fly by creating dom elements by $(something).append(TASK)    2) I hope its correct way to manipulate hidden input filed value.
[09:00:38] <TheEternalAbyss_> Velveeta: the increasing of the pie size deg value in transform shows that increase if you add it by hand
[09:00:39] <lintguy> I'm trying to make a page makro, by injecting a script. But i get undefined on an array item and i just cannot understand why: http://pastebin.com/0NQy25Mk
[09:00:49] <Guest20878> be right back Velveeta  and will read your answer. thanks in advance
[09:00:57] <Velveeta> aracodex123: off the top of my head, i don't know
[09:01:13] <TheEternalAbyss_> pie slice size i mean
[09:01:38] <aracodex123> Velveeta: haha, I'm going nuts trying to figure this one out
[09:01:44] <aracodex123> but thanks anyway
[09:01:53] <TheEternalAbyss_> Velveeta: #pieSlice1 .pie <-- in there
[09:02:08] <TheEternalAbyss_> the transform: rotate(1deg);
[09:02:21] <TheEternalAbyss_> you increase that, you'll see a change
[09:03:01] <TheEternalAbyss_> woa....wait...
[09:03:15] <TheEternalAbyss_> ok your interval method rotates it
[09:03:27] <ukando> About the round circle - the problem is in CSS (if it helps)
[09:03:31] <Velveeta> ahh, no wonder, i have the wrong element selector in that interval
[09:03:56] <ukando> I mean the blu progress round bar here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hjJcf
[09:04:14] <Velveeta> yeah, there we go: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/hjJcf
[09:04:30] <aracodex123> Velveeta: I got an idea! Can I somehow rename sortable() to sortable2() and use it as a separate function from sortable?
[09:05:00] <Velveeta> aracodex123: you mean, to store 2 different sets of sortable data on an element?
[09:05:36] <aracodex123> Velveeta: yes!
[09:05:37] <ukando> cool circle :)
[09:06:35] <sifu_> hey guys i am trying to use the onbeforeunload event  but in IE8 it has some weird behaviour where it keeps firing the event when a link is clicked...tried creating a function that would stop it from happening...but i must be making some mistake as it is not working at all...ay pointers would be great! http://jsfiddle.net/ZWPG2/ thanks
[09:06:53] <Velveeta> aracodex123: technically, if you created another entry with the widget factory for something like this: $.widget('ui.sortable2', $.ui.sortable.prototype), you could do something like that, but that's a really ugly solution
[09:07:45] <Velveeta> sifu_: you're nulling out the event as soon as the document loads, so when it should be firing, there's nothing to fire
[09:08:01] <aracodex123> I understand that this solution is extremely ugly and probably violates quite a few coding conventions, but there's just no way to have 2 handlers ... and this is about the only solution I can come up with
[09:08:26] <sifu_> Velveeta hmm
[09:09:20] <sifu_> so i have to put it outside the document.ready i suppose?
[09:10:52] <Velveeta> well, i'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do there
[09:11:08] <sifu_> agh let me explain
[09:11:09] <Velveeta> the proper thing to do would be to figure out why it's firing multiple times in ie8
[09:11:26] <Velveeta> using a breakpoint and check your call stack and figure out where those multiple firings are coming from
[09:13:28] <sifu_> i have got a function that i want to fire when the user tries to close the window.....it worked fine in  other browsers but in IE, clicking on any link would fire it and close the window (the fired function closes the window)
[09:14:25] <Velveeta> right, what i'm saying is you should hunt down where the extra calls to that function are coming from in ie8
[09:14:32] <sifu_> ahh
[09:14:33] <Velveeta> and use that info to stop it from happening
[09:15:15] <sifu_> i guess i need to but i suck at jquery atm (;p) and won't know where to look...
[09:16:01] <Velveeta> well you don't need to know jquery, this is just regular js debugging
[09:16:09] <Velveeta> just add a breakpoint to your unload callback
[09:16:14] <sifu_> okey
[09:16:16] <sifu_> will do thanks
[09:16:37] <aracodex123> Velveeta: it didn't work...
[09:16:50] <Velveeta> aracodex123: i'm not sure what to tell you then :)
[09:16:54] <sifu_> Velveeta where do i look after adding that breakpoint...that is the part i get confused as there seems to be so much options
[09:18:16] <Velveeta> sifu_: you should have a call stack available to look through, which should show you where that event is stemming from
[09:18:16] <TheEternalAbyss_> ugh I can't find the kill command anywhere..
[09:18:17] <aracodex123> how bout ... say I put 2 icons side by side, and from the event handler, can I determine which icon I was clicking on, and I put in an if statement to check, if ( .singleMove ) {do this} elseif (.multiMove) {//do something else}
[09:18:30] <sifu_> Velveeta okey thanks
[09:18:33] <Velveeta> the other option would be to just null out the unload event inside of the unload event handler itself
[09:19:19] <Velveeta> aracodex123: yes, you can add a drag start callback to tell which element was clicked on *i believe*, but having that knowledge doesn't mean that you'll be able to programmatically add other elements to the collection that's being moved
[09:21:20] <lasha> Velveeta: how are you so active in here? no work? lol
[09:21:39] <Velveeta> lasha: multitasking ;)
[09:22:56] <aracodex123> Velveeta: guess I'll give it a shot to find out :)

[09:37:32] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> no it shouldn't hide
[09:37:35] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> it should collapse

[09:42:38] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> http://pastebin.com/wRbgWjUG
[09:42:55] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> $(".collapse_div h3").each(function(i)
[09:43:12] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> in that loop it should check the class of the h3, depending on that it should be open or closed
[09:43:49] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Sorry, forgot the h3: http://pastebin.com/ej5ju7Se
[09:45:08] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> .next().hide() perhaps?
[09:45:31] <lintguy> I think it's easier to do $(".collapse_div").not('.minus').accordion({ active: 0 , collapsible: true});
[09:45:50] <lintguy> Sorry
[09:45:54] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> but then the ones with minus won't be accordionized
[09:46:24] <lintguy> $(".collapse_div").not('.collapse_div.minus').accordion({ active: 0 , collapsible: true});
[09:46:30] <lintguy> That should do it
[09:48:00] <lintguy> It might be easier if post the html too into a jsfiddle
[09:48:09] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> Ok, sec

[09:49:45] <aracodex123> Velveeta: I'm able to determine the mouse position, but that's about it... I can't tell if I've clicked on icon1 or icon2...
[09:52:21] <ecky-ptang-zoobo> lintguy: pm
[09:55:58] <Velveeta> aracodex123: try looking in event.target to see if it'll give you the original element that was clicked on
[09:56:50] <Velveeta> and now i have to go afk for probably a couple of hours
[09:58:39] <aracodex123> Velveeta: THX! I found it, not in event.target, but in event.toElement =D
[10:00:46] <ThoMe> hihio :-)
[10:00:49] <ThoMe> Velveeta: huhu?
[10:02:29] <Velveeta> hxhx?
[10:03:32] <ThoMe> Velveeta: :P have a question, i have a table tr with id and click to element " DeviceUriChange" and open a dialog (jquery ui dialog). i qould like in the dialog get the parent id (from the tr element)
[10:03:40] <ThoMe> Velveeta: my code http://paste.keks.be/448
[10:03:46] <ThoMe> line 54
[10:05:10] <ThoMe> Velveeta: can you maybe help?
[10:05:33] <shoky> ThoMe: in the click handler you can get that id with  $(this).closest('tr').prop('id')
[10:06:00] <Velveeta> right, and then you'll have to pass that to the dialog's open event as a custom property
[10:06:15] <Velveeta> and then probably bind it to that dialog in some way if you want to reference it in other dialog functions
[10:06:39] <ThoMe> shoky / Velveeta: yes, right, but when i try: undefined
[10:06:49] <ThoMe> i think "this" is from dialog()
[10:06:59] <ThoMe> i need "this" from the click event or?
[10:07:05] <Velveeta> he's talking about the click event that opens it
[10:07:14] <Velveeta> and it looks like the open method doesn't accept any parameters
[10:07:27] <ThoMe> Velveeta: http://paste.keks.be/448 what can i change?
[10:08:06] <Velveeta> so you'd have to bind that data property at the time you launch it, something like this: $('#dialog_form').data('current_tr', $(this).closest('tr').prop('id')).dialog('open');
[10:08:16] <shoky> ThoMe:  in the click handler you can do:  var trId = $(this).closest('tr').prop('id');  $('#dialog-form')........ what velveeta said
[10:08:25] <Velveeta> and then within your dialog functions, you should be able to reference $(this).data('current_tr')
[10:08:37] * Velveeta high-fives shoky.
[10:08:42] <shoky> ;D
[10:08:59] <Velveeta> they're about to start our thanksgiving stuff here at work, so i'm about to be all up outta this keyboard
[10:09:06] <Velveeta> because these people are beasts, so i need a spot in line
[10:10:16] <shoky> oohh thanksgiving. sounds yummy
[10:17:30] <Velveeta> success!
[10:20:48] <ThoMe> shoky: hm. ok, thx.
[10:21:11] <ThoMe> shoky: when i use dialog and use ajax for post then said firefox
[10:21:11] <ThoMe> TypeError: 'stepUp' called on an object that does not implement interface HTMLInputElement.
[10:22:00] <shoky> ThoMe: uhm no idea what that is
[10:22:03] <ThoMe> hm.
[10:22:43] <ThoMe> ah. my error.
[10:22:51] <ThoMe> i use cupsServerHostName but this not available ;)
[10:33:22] <LoneSoldier728> hey if i have 10 inputs with the same class how do I specify it to affect only this input
[10:33:24] <LoneSoldier728> and not all of them
[10:34:17] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: .eq(index)
[10:34:40] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: If it has a name you can target it that way as well... plenty of ways.
[10:34:47] <LoneSoldier728> $('.category').change(function () {
[10:35:16] <LoneSoldier728> well the thing is there can be 10 or 20 inputs it depends how many fields the user wants
[10:35:27] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: So which do you want?
[10:35:38] <astropirate> Hello friends
[10:35:38] <LoneSoldier728> I just have to be able to affect the change event only for the input that is currently selected
[10:35:42] <LoneSoldier728> aka changed
[10:35:54] <astropirate> is it a good idea to store a function reference in the data-* attribute of a node?
[10:35:56] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/8zwH5STG
[10:36:03] <LoneSoldier728> that is the code BillCriswell
[10:36:55] <LoneSoldier728> line 53 needs to target the select (dropdown) when it changes only on the one that changes so it does not change the following dropdown (input) of all of the second inputs
[10:37:36] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: I think you want "this".
[10:37:40] <t3ch> does anyone have any advice on solving this problem?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20101804/change-links-and-content-in-iframe-with-jquery-regex-extension
[10:37:49] <efco> astropirate why not
[10:38:03] <efco> astropirate you can store whatever you want in a data attribute
[10:38:03] <t3ch> I'm attempting to access and manipulate the contents of an iframe from the parent element DOM
[10:38:10] <BillCriswell> Like, if you do $('.category').change(function(){ }); inside that callback `this` is the element that was changed.
[10:38:12] <LoneSoldier728> right but I cant just call this in there can i?
[10:38:15] <t3ch> both are of the same domain.
[10:38:23] <LoneSoldier728> oh so within it
[10:38:46] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: Yeah, $('.category').change(function(){ $(this).addClass('just-changed'); });
[10:39:51] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: I like to do var $this = $(this); then whenever I want the element the event happened on I can just use $this.
[10:40:26] <astropirate> efco, sweeeeeeeet. thnx
[10:40:51] <astropirate> efco, well except mongodb objectIds
[10:41:01] <LoneSoldier728> ok thanks so what i need to do is say item.append to just work for (line 81)
[10:41:04] <LoneSoldier728> for this
[10:41:08] <LoneSoldier728> .next()
[10:41:10] <LoneSoldier728> or something?
[10:41:17] <astropirate> if you try to access them through the data() funciton, it thinks the hex value is a number and gives it to you in e  notation which fracks everything up
[10:41:29] <LoneSoldier728> or how do i select the select dropdown that is a sibling to the this
[10:42:58] <BillCriswell> $(this).next() will return the next child.
[10:43:44] <BillCriswell> If you want to use a selector you might be better off doing $(this).closest('.some-parent').find('.selector')
[10:44:04] <LoneSoldier728> $this.next().append(
[10:44:10] <LoneSoldier728> this wont work right
[10:44:46] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: That can work.
[10:45:22] <BillCriswell> var $this = $(this); $this.next().append('whatever'); would add 'whatever' to the inside of the next child.
[10:45:46] <LoneSoldier728> well it is not a child
[10:45:52] <LoneSoldier728> it is a sibling
[10:46:01] <BillCriswell> I meant that sorry.
[10:46:04] <BillCriswell> Long day.
[10:46:09] <LoneSoldier728> oh ok so i dont need .siblings()
[10:46:16] <LoneSoldier728> it is not working for some reason
[10:47:54] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: http://jsbin.com/uFILuPEW/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:48:32] <LoneSoldier728> ya hm i might be doing something wrong
[10:49:03] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/1AnVYVsw
[10:49:27] <LoneSoldier728> line 55 i am trying to do the append
[10:49:42] <LoneSoldier728> this is correct because line 37 is the right output
[10:50:50] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: You can't use $this without defining it.
[10:51:08] <LoneSoldier728> i define it on
[10:51:10] <LoneSoldier728> line 54
[10:51:20] <ThoMe> shoky: when i open a dialog (jquery ui) and close and reopen.. i have the old values in the box.
[10:51:28] <ThoMe> can i when i close the box clear all ?
[10:51:29] <LoneSoldier728> line 26
[10:51:31] <LoneSoldier728> i mean sorry
[10:51:57] <ThoMe> ah.. have.
[10:53:13] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: Is $this.next() a select?
[10:54:00] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[10:54:05] <LoneSoldier728> well it should be
[10:54:14] <LoneSoldier728> how can i tell doing console.log
[10:54:22] <LoneSoldier728> around  $this.next()
[10:54:29] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:54:57] <BillCriswell> Do console.log($this.next()[0]) and it should give you back just a simple HTML element to look at.
[10:55:03] <LoneSoldier728> shows undefined
[10:55:09] * jmpp_ greets!
[10:55:17] <BillCriswell> Well there you go.
[10:55:43] <LoneSoldier728> why is it undefined tho
[10:55:49] <jmpp_> Is it possible to define a non-enumeble method for a built-in object with jquery, much in the same way that Object.defineProperty() does?
[10:55:52] <t3ch> anyone?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20101804/change-links-and-content-in-iframe-with-jquery-regex-extension
[10:56:02] <LoneSoldier728> if i just have $this in there it is fine
[10:56:03] <t3ch> all items are from the same domain.
[10:56:15] <jmpp_> I could do it manually with Object.defineProperty(), but then I'd have to fight against browser compatibility issues myself
[10:56:24] <jmpp_> which is the very reason why I use jQuery ;)
[10:56:34] <Xal_> when you use .load() to add another file to the page, at what point does it get added to the DOM?
[10:56:50] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: So you have two selects right "next" to eachother?
[10:57:02] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[10:57:08] <LoneSoldier728> select then it has option children
[10:57:10] <LoneSoldier728> but yes
[10:57:34] <LoneSoldier728> and the second select depends on what the first select -ed is
[10:58:24] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: And the source is like <select class="category">..</select><select class="trying-to-get-populated">...</select>
[10:58:24] <Xal_> Because I'm stepping through it, and right after .load() is called, I can't use identifiers to bring up anything in the inserted file
[10:58:34] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[10:59:03] <BillCriswell> Can't tell without looking at everything in action.
[10:59:52] <LoneSoldier728> well i moved .next() and that whole line out of the forEach
[11:00:36] <LoneSoldier728> and appended an option just saying hi
[11:00:40] <LoneSoldier728> and it still does nothing
[11:04:13] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: http://jsbin.com/uFILuPEW/3/edit?html,js,output Does this help?
[11:04:44] <BillCriswell> It's doing exactly what I think you're explaining.
[11:05:38] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[11:06:49] <LoneSoldier728> how do i find the element selected
[11:07:01] <LoneSoldier728> from this.next to see if the correct one is even being selected
[11:07:19] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: You just said it was undefined.
[11:07:37] <LoneSoldier728> it is not undefined outside of the forEach
[11:08:17] <BillCriswell> Do the same thing outside of the foreach to see if it's what you think it is.
[11:09:37] <LoneSoldier728> ok they all seem to match now
[11:10:38] <LoneSoldier728> this.append works but this.next.append does not
[11:10:43] <LoneSoldier728> it has to do with the next
[11:11:01] <acidjazz> so i have a scrolling site w/ a header i want position fixed at the top.. never moving.. but i want the main div right under it to be able to scroll... above.. z-index isnt happenin gfor me.. any suggs?
[11:11:39] <acidjazz> yay i did it
[11:11:41] <acidjazz> position relative
[11:11:45] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: ok.
[11:15:58] <jmpp_> so, anyone know of a way to mimic Object.defineProperty()'s ability to define non-enumerable properties with jQuery?
[11:21:40] <felixjet> is there any way to do this
[11:21:42] <felixjet> $('input[type=checkbox]').each(function () {
[11:21:48] <felixjet> but with unchecked ones?
[11:21:55] <felixjet> do i just need to add :unchecked ?
[11:21:58] <felixjet> or its different
[11:22:57] <BillCriswell> felixjet: You can do like... $(':checkbox').not(':checked').each() I fink.
[11:23:58] <felixjet> im gonna try, ty
[11:24:41] <BillCriswell> No problemoooooooo
[11:27:13] <ericx2x> asd
[11:27:49] <felixjet> and how i do this? $(this).('input:checkbox:not(:checked)')
[11:28:02] <felixjet> i know thats not the way to select this + inputs
[11:28:11] <felixjet> but i cant remember the syntax u_______u
[11:29:23] <ThoMe> is it wrong $('#inputDeviceUri input').keyup(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); } });?
[11:29:35] <ThoMe> i would like in the field with id inputDeviceUri and type input

[11:31:13] <BillCriswell> Are komodo dragons dangerous?
[11:36:09] <BillCriswell> It's amazing that it's not related to dinosaurs, but birds are.

[11:43:14] <Serdar> Hiya
[11:43:32] <skift> i am using jqui accordion as described here: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[11:44:18] <Serdar> how can I catch the x button in modal window?
[11:44:29] <skift> but when I load the page, all of the accordion bodies are forced to be the same length. so if accordion 1 is just a few words, and accordion 2 is 10 paragraphs, then both will have an accordion body the length of 10 paragraphs
[11:44:57] <adv_> anyone knows of a UI that has metadata editing functionality?
[11:45:28] <BillCriswell> Say whatttttt
[11:46:35] <adv_> user uploads an mp3 file. UI lets him edit the title, artist, year etc
[11:47:15] <felixjet> why this doesnt work? :(  $('.form-control').submit(function() {
[11:47:15] <felixjet>  $(this).each('input:checkbox:not(:checked)', function() {
[11:47:43] <ph88_> what doesn't work about it ?
[11:47:52] <felixjet> it throws an error
[11:48:07] <BillCriswell> felixjet: I think you want $(this).find('input:checkbox:not(:checked)').each()
[11:48:11] <felixjet> object have no method 'apply0
[11:48:12] <ph88_> you mind sharing that error ? =]
[11:48:17] <felixjet> 'apply'
[11:48:19] <BillCriswell> Can't just toss in a selector wherever you want it.
[11:49:29] <felixjet> yay it works
[11:49:34] <felixjet> thx again xD
[11:49:38] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:01:31] <Xal_> If I want to call a function, how do I perform another action after it when I'm sure that all the asynchronous functions called from the first have completed?
[12:02:47] <liamkeily> Xal_: you call the next function in a call back function, what is the context?
[12:03:30] <BillCriswell> Xal_: If you're function returns a promise you can do like $.when( doShit ).then( doOtherShit );
[12:03:32] <liamkeily> for example in an ajax request you would put the next function call in the complete:function(data){ }
[12:04:18] <Xal_> The first is a custom function that I wrote
[12:04:31] <Xal_> It's inside $(document).ready()
[12:05:18] <Xal_> Some of the functions called inside it have their own callbacks defined
[12:05:36] <Xal_> I want to make sure all of those have completed.
[12:05:57] <Xal_> Before this other thing I have to have done.
[12:16:51] <Xal_> There's a .Callbacks() function, but I'm not entirely sure how to use it in this context.
[12:19:46] <shoky> Xal_: and those callbacks are from jquery methods? or other third-party libs?
[12:20:04] <Xal_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[12:20:08] <shoky> not that
[12:20:14] <shoky> <Xal_> Some of the functions called inside it have their own callbacks defined
[12:20:38] <Xal_> they're all basically from .load() functions
[12:20:59] <Xal_> performing an action after the load completes
[12:21:24] <shoky> hrm .load() doesn't make it convenient, ok
[12:21:48] <shoky> you can setup a $.Deferred() for each of the loads you wanna keep track of
[12:22:02] <shoky> and in the load callback call .resolve()  on the deferred
[12:22:26] <shoky> then you can use $.when to listen for all those deferreds being completed
[12:24:19] <shoky> Xal_: e.g.   var dfd1 = $.Deferred(), dfd2 = $.Deferred();  $(..).load('url', dfd1.resolve);   $(..).load('url2', dfd2.resolve);      $.when(dfd1, dfd2).then(function(data1, data2) { ...both loads are done... })
[12:25:01] <shoky> or if you want an array of deferreds instead:  $.when.apply($, arrayOfDeferreds).then(...)
[12:28:43] <Xal_> here's the problem. those loads have their own callbacks which are custom functions that don't have their own callback.
[12:29:01] <Xal_> It's those custom functions that I'm trying to wait for.
[12:29:23] <shoky> they don't give you a way to be notified when their asyncronous shit is done?
[12:30:10] <shoky> also this is completely not what you said before :\
[12:30:17] <shoky> [22:20:40] <Xal_> they're all basically from .load() functions
[12:30:17] <shoky> [22:21:01] <Xal_> performing an action after the load completes
[12:31:07] <Xal_> actually, wait
[12:38:37] <nicetry> Hello, I have a page that has an iframe on it.   I'm wondering if there is any way to set up (on the parent page) an event to fire off whenever someone clicks a link inside the iframe (irregardless of what page is being displayed inside the iframe)
[12:39:14] <nicetry> I've looked at the on
[12:39:37] <nicetry> onLoad* property, but that happens after the iframe is done loading. I want something when they first click the a link inside the iframe
[12:40:40] <Xal_> use onLoad to set onClick functions on the links in the iframe
[12:41:24] <nicetry> hmmmm! interesting!
[12:41:49] <nicetry> is there any way for jquery to catch if a request has been made (instead of doing it by click do it by outgoing request)?
[12:42:24] <Xal_> That, I'm not sure about
[12:44:27] <Pritchard> I am auto-saving forms when users tab off of them.  Tabbing off an input puts focus in a jquery datepicker field.  This pops up a jquery datepicker, but by the time the user can select a day, the content on the page has been replaced by new content from the webserver.  This makes the instance information for the datepicker invalid.
[12:44:48] <Pritchard> An exception is thrown as a result and my datepicker breaks.
[12:45:57] <Xal_> shoky, can you take a look at this?
[12:45:59] <Xal_> http://pastebin.com/HMPu6Jhj
[12:46:37] <shoky> Xal_:  if you're calling resolve yourself you need to .resolve()
[12:46:40] <shoky> with the parens
[12:46:59] <shoky> line 16
[12:47:01] <shoky> er 17
[12:47:06] <shoky> (but not 23)
[12:47:10] <Xal_> Oh. Right. That works
[12:47:26] <Xal_> I should have known that
[12:50:11] <ArchBeOS> hey guys, i have an odd issue that i just dont know how to handle. How do I save text in a modal dialog (within a textarea) to a file?
[12:50:43] <BillCriswell> Just wrote two dates.. one with dashes and one with slashes. No idea why I choose either.
[12:52:15] <shoky> ArchBeOS: send it to the server?
[12:52:52] <ArchBeOS> i did but the server cant send back the file
[12:53:17] <shoky> you want the user to download it?
[12:53:35] <ArchBeOS> yeah
[12:54:50] <shoky> then you need to redirect the browser to a page with the right http headers being sent,
[12:55:11] <shoky> Content-Type and Content-Disposition
[12:55:22] <ArchBeOS> http://pastie.org/private/n65t87lfwqe8wow76cxarq
[12:55:24] <shoky> or maybe there's a new way in modern browsers, dunno
[12:56:55] <BillCriswell> shoky: Wonder if you could use data: in a href and the download attribute.
[12:57:30] <shoky> no idea
[12:58:07] <shoky> ArchBeOS: ok the problem is that you're doing this as an ajax request,
[12:58:37] <ArchBeOS> how should i handle it then? I am really noobish with this stuff
[12:58:40] <shoky> ArchBeOS: but you need to actually redirect to another page, (either manually in code, or click a link or submit a form)
[12:59:04] <ArchBeOS> so $.post?
[12:59:10] <shoky> no, sec
[12:59:12] <ArchBeOS> k
[12:59:15] <ArchBeOS> thanks so much
[12:59:40] <shoky> you could split the server part into 2 parts
[12:59:42] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha, works.

[13:00:21] <shoky> ArchBeOS: the save_file will do the saving on the server side, and return a download-url to the $.ajax success callback
[13:00:35] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/eXOrIzej/2/edit?html,output little cleaner
[13:00:46] <shoky> ArchBeOS: and this download url will on the server-side do the send_file  stuff
[13:00:56] <ArchBeOS> cool
[13:01:03] <ArchBeOS> thanks!
[13:01:07] <shoky> ArchBeOS: and in the ajax success callback you do window.location.replace(data)  wher data is the download url
[13:01:07] <ArchBeOS> let me try it out
[13:01:30] <shoky> (if you don't want to replace the main window location you could also use an iframe)
[13:01:49] <shoky> and again, there could be better more modern ways of doing this, i dunno
[13:01:59] <shoky> and BillCriswell now ill see what yo're up to ;p
[13:02:28] <Serdar> is it possible to catch when the x close button is pressed?
[13:02:28] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha I was tyring to avoid the server side part of it.
[13:03:02] <Serdar> at modal window
[13:05:45] <shoky> BillCriswell: nice,doesnt work for me in FF tho
[13:06:01] <BillCriswell> shoky: Dang.
[13:10:45] <Pritchard> Manually setting the IDs to be unique and consistent across web requests resolved the issue with DatePicker.  It apparently was giving text elements without IDs a unique ID behind the scenes when the datepicker was registered to the element.
[13:12:17] <BillCriswell> shoky: I figured you'd know. Is there anyway to automatically click that link and trigger the download. I don't think it's possible? http://jsbin.com/eXOrIzej/2/edit?html,js,output
[13:12:23] <nhulea> hey is there a way to send $(id).val(); to another html page ? so I can use the val for something else on another page ?
[13:12:39] <nhulea> would that be $post and $get ?
[13:13:17] <BillCriswell> nhulea: From the other page you can do $('.load-content-from-other-page-here').load('other-page.html #id')
[13:13:43] <BillCriswell> You can't send it to another page without a server connecting the two in some way.
[13:15:13] <BillCriswell> nhulea: http://socket.io/
[13:15:14] <felixjet> how i can convert this into a live() event ? $('.delete a').on('click', function(event) {
[13:15:14] <shoky> BillCriswell:  running .click() on the native element
[13:15:22] <felixjet> i dont understand what is wrong
[13:15:38] <felixjet> but im adding new .delete a dinamically and the click trigger doesnt work on them
[13:15:49] <BillCriswell> shoky: Why do I feel like that hasn't worked in the past..
[13:16:42] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://jsbin.com/eXOrIzej/6/edit this seems dangerous... couldn't I just loop this and download like a million files? haha
[13:17:58] <nhulea> BillCriswell: yeah I figured I saw .load yeah I am using socket io for a chat app but I want clients to start on a page that they fill out there user and room name and then its send them there
[13:20:45] <LoneSoldier728> damn i dont get why this does not work
[13:21:00] <LoneSoldier728> http://jsfiddle.net/437fh/  http://pastebin.com/1AnVYVsw
[13:21:08] <LoneSoldier728> what is different in the jsfiddle that it works
[13:21:15] <LoneSoldier728> that is not the same in my pastebin
[13:27:06] <Woet> LoneSoldier728: what is the error and/or problem?
[13:27:13] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/36Xj6duz  - MY code, http://jsfiddle.net/437fh/ - My test code
[13:27:23] <Woet> yes, you linked that
[13:27:24] <LoneSoldier728> basically for my code line 32
[13:27:27] <Woet> that doesn't tell me the error
[13:27:29] <LoneSoldier728> it does not append
[13:27:37] <LoneSoldier728> if I remove .next() it does append
[13:27:55] <LoneSoldier728> but to the same dropdown, but I don't get then how to append to the next dropdown
[13:29:34] <sacho_> -say what
[13:30:16] <LoneSoldier728> you asking me sacho?
[13:31:24] <sacho_> why don't you provide a fiddle with "your code" as well
[13:31:31] <LoneSoldier728> ah
[13:31:37] <LoneSoldier728> i did?
[13:31:46] <LoneSoldier728> i think i realized the issue maybe because I have a label
[13:31:48] <LoneSoldier728> wrapping it
[13:32:24] <LoneSoldier728> ya that has to be it
[13:33:45] <sacho_> well, you provided a pastebin, not a fiddle, with no html :)
[13:34:20] <LoneSoldier728> the html is created in the pastebin heh
[13:34:24] <LoneSoldier728> in the jquery
[13:34:28] <BillCriswell> shoky: Chrome gave me a little bar saying "this website is attempting to download multiple files".
[13:34:52] <LoneSoldier728> damn that is annoying so I have to do this type of call
[13:35:04] <LoneSoldier728> $this.parent().next().children().append
[13:35:17] <LoneSoldier728> or is there an easier way? if not how do i select the first child
[13:36:02] <jedimind> :first-child
[13:36:39] <LoneSoldier728> ya kk so no easier way tho
[13:36:53] <jedimind> how much easier do you need it than that ?
[13:37:09] <jedimind> its 12 characters
[13:37:13] <LoneSoldier728> ya kk
[13:37:15] <LoneSoldier728> no not that
[13:37:19] <LoneSoldier728> i meant than writing all this
[13:37:24] <LoneSoldier728> $this.parent().next().children(':first-child').append
[13:38:58] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: If you don't like the selector change your HTML haha
[13:39:45] <t3ch> does anyone have any advice on solving this problem?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20101804/change-links-and-content-in-iframe-with-jquery-regex-extension
[13:40:09] <BillCriswell> How about something like.. <select data-select-chain="1">...</select> <select data-select-chain="2">...</select> then just do $('select[data-select-chain=2]') and so on.
[13:40:59] <LoneSoldier728> lol
[13:41:15] <LoneSoldier728> ya it has to be flexible to accept everything whatever, it all works thanks for all your help before
[13:41:26] <LoneSoldier728> sorry I left out the fact that I wrapped it in a label
[13:41:42] <LoneSoldier728> I didnt realize that stopped the .next() call till i just did a double look of the ui
[13:45:53] <BillCriswell>  LoneSoldier728 http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/chained this helpful?
[14:00:26] <gerayeremin> Hello I am a first timer in the room and would like to see if someone can help me with some code
[14:03:00] <dokma> I have an equivalent of:   function updateForm() { $('elem').change(function() {updateForm();}); }
[14:03:28] <dokma> and it goes into a weird recursion that gets deeper the more calls go to updateForm
[14:03:54] <dokma> so my q is how to avoid $.change() triggering itself ?
[14:09:37] <anEffingChamp> dokma: Can you change the name of the second function call?
[14:09:56] <dokma> let me try one idea I just had
[14:10:42] <nhulea> BillCriswell: why isn't this working http://jsfiddle.net/u6B5w/ am i using load wrong?
[14:10:48] <anEffingChamp> I can not see why it would not trigger its self since they both have the same name.
[14:11:08] <Serdar> at modal window I can use close: function() {} to catch when the window is closing
[14:11:29] <Serdar> but how can I fetch if it is closing because I pressed the x
[14:11:59] <Serdar> I hoped this was fetch only
[14:12:01] <Serdar> err
[14:12:10] <Serdar> x I mean

[14:27:22] <Velveeta> i actually don't even have whatever my last line was in my scrollback anymore
[14:27:32] <Ben__> :(
[14:27:43] <Velveeta> ben__: maybe a trailing comma somewhere?
[14:27:47] <nhulea> any one know how to use jquery to send an input value to another html page ?

[14:28:34] <Velveeta> dude… don't do that
[14:28:44] <Ben__> sorry :~/
[14:28:45] <Velveeta> if you have to paste code, paste it in a pastebin or jsfiddle or something and give us the link

[14:29:22] <Ben__> :D
[14:29:35] <Guest20878> Velveeta,  hm. any logs of this channel? with you or on internet?
[14:29:49] <Velveeta> ben__: is it not giving you a line number where it says the object is expected?
[14:29:53] <Ben__> ie9 says its on the line with UpdateNav function
[14:30:04] <Velveeta> guest20878: there are logs somewhere online, but i'm not sure where they are.. i've seen people pull from them before though
[14:30:07] <Ben__> thats function is called after.
[14:30:21] <Velveeta> just google #jquery freenode logs and see if you can come up with anything
[14:30:31] <Guest20878> Velveeta, hm ok . thx!!
[14:31:13] <Ben__> issue is so annoying.
[14:31:23] <Velveeta> ben__: is there an actual page where i can see this in action?

[14:37:25] <Betal> how can I force a scroll down in a <textarea>
[14:39:51] <sam__> Hi, I have AjaxForm setup to handle a form, with a "success" and "error" method set up. When you submit the form and the request times out, the error method is called twice, once immediately, and once after the defined timeout limit. Does anyone know what might be causing this?
[14:53:37] <lasha> Betal: you cant.
[14:55:08] <lasha> you can use a contenteditable div, perhaps
[15:02:39] <Betal> lasha: something like that ( http://jsfiddle.net/8z4Na/ ) sometimes works on firefox and I never have seen it to works on chrome, Ill try with contenteditable div so
[15:32:58] <Betal> lasha: the div works, using div.scrollTop(div[0].scrollHeight); using div = $("#log");
[15:33:36] <Betal> lasha: thanks :D
[15:41:21] <lasha> Betal: you got it man :)
[15:43:27] <drewwinget> Hello. I'm trying to wrap my head around the deferred object, since I need to monitor an unknown number of ajax calls and calculations (in their callbacks), and fire some interface update functions when all this is done.
[15:44:20] <drewwinget> I am making ajax requests, whose callbacks do some calculations that are saved to a client-side model. I call these requests with jquery.each()
[15:44:46] <drewwinget> How can I monitor when all this is done, and run my other initialisation code then.
[15:44:47] <drewwinget> ?
[15:44:51] <drewwinget> Gist incoming.
[15:46:50] <drewwinget> https://gist.github.com/aeschylus/7573346#file-initalise-after-ajax-calls-L28-L39
[15:47:13] <drewwinget> That highlights my initialisation process. Notice I am passing a deferred into my "getAnnotations" function.
[15:47:52] <drewwinget> This function makes a bunch of calls and pushes some calculated results to some arrays from the callbacks of these ajax calls.
[15:48:06] <drewwinget> Here is the same gist, with the body of that function highlighted.
[15:48:28] <drewwinget> https://gist.github.com/aeschylus/7573346#file-initalise-after-ajax-calls-L72-L105
[15:48:47] <drewwinget> Is it clear what I am saying? Any help understanding jQuery's promises would be much appreciated.
[15:49:08] <drewwinget> It seems to be the best way to solve the problem, if I could wrap my head around it.
[15:49:31] <lasha> http://eng.wealthfront.com/2012/12/jquerydeferred-is-most-important-client.html
[15:49:33] <Velveeta> drewwinget: if you need to know when they're all done, then you need to push the deferreds themselves onto an array that some external source has access to
[15:49:52] <lasha> jquery ajax methods all returned a deferred object
[15:50:00] <Velveeta> and then you can pass them to $.when with the apply method… $.when.apply(this, myDeferredArray).done(function () {})
[15:50:14] <lasha> where you can do things like .done and .when
[15:50:57] <Velveeta> or rather you should push their promises onto an array i suppose… as you create each deferred object, myDeferredArray.push(dfd.promise());
[15:51:23] <Velveeta> and then when you're done w/ your .each loop that's actually firing them all off, send that array of deferred promises to $.when.apply
[15:51:31] <Velveeta> i gotta get outta here for now
[15:51:51] <drewwinget> Okay. That helps somewhat, thank you Velveeta.
[15:52:06] <lasha> read this
[15:52:07] <lasha> http://eng.wealthfront.com/2012/12/jquerydeferred-is-most-important-client.html
[15:53:08] <lasha> and this
[15:53:08] <lasha> http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[15:53:52] <drewwinget> I found the wealthfront piece, but it seemed a bit lacking, in that it didn't say how (or if) I could declaratively bind the callbacks as I have in the "create" function in my gist above. I have seen several resources suggest what Velveeta just did. I will try that, but I wonder if what I did in the "create" funciton above is correct.
[15:54:12] <drewwinget> I will also read your second resource.
[15:54:35] <drewwinget> Ajax calls automatically return a promise, don't they? So can I just push them into an array?
[15:55:36] <Velveeta> yes
[15:55:50] <Velveeta> and in that same function, pass them to $.when.apply
[15:55:52] <Velveeta> and return *that*
[15:56:13] <Velveeta> and then from your calling function, tie your .done function to its return
[15:56:17] <Velveeta> you can just chain off of the function call
[15:56:31] <Velveeta> _this.getAnnotations().done(function () {})
[15:56:57] <Velveeta> $.when will return a master deferred promise that marks the resolution of the entire list of deferreds you pass to it, or will auto-reject when the first of them rejects
[15:57:43] <Velveeta> ok, now i gotta get outta here for real or else my wife is gonna killz me
[15:57:47] <dragoonis> Hi there, I have an <a> tag that has no binds to it (from what I can see) and nothing happens when I click on it.. I did stick a bind on it to alert('clicked'); and it worked fine.
[15:57:49] <nhulea> is there any way to send a .val to another html page ? thanks
[15:58:00] <dragoonis> Can someone advise me on how to trace down what part of JS is firing when I click on this link.
[15:58:13] <dragoonis> Something is doing event.PreventDefault() for sure

[16:35:38] <shoky> ZzaichikK: .prevAll returns elements in reverse order
[16:36:11] <shoky> ZzaichikK: you could change it to.. $($('#' + this.id + '-slide').prevAll('li').get().reverse())
[16:36:13] <ZzaichikK> oh
[16:36:35] <ZzaichikK> ahhhh, alright cool. I'll try that
[16:40:11] <ZzaichikK> shoky: any feedback on that snippet in general?
[16:40:26] <ZzaichikK> I mean, would you have done things differently?

[16:44:16] <shoky> ZzaichikK: i'd maybe add a .stop(true)  before any animation/delay to an element, so it behaves a bit nicer when you click a lot on diff buttons quickly
[16:45:14] <ZzaichikK> shoky: ah yes. Okay thank you!
[16:46:18] <shoky> ZzaichikK: and i'd personally use setTimeout instead of clearInterval just cause i like it better, though you seem to be using clearInterval in a safe way so it doesn't matter much
[16:46:37] <shoky> oops i meant setInterval ;p
[16:51:49] <ZzaichikK> shoky: I may try it out that way, see how it goes. I'm a little worried about using setInterval because I don't want to create an "interval stack" sick clearInterval will only clear one and if a user somehow manages to trigger it twice, stopping it will become a problem.
[16:51:54] <ZzaichikK> thanks yo
[16:52:15] <ZzaichikK> since*
[16:57:56] <drewwinget> Velveeta: Thanks, that worked like a charm. And thank you for the reading lasha.
[17:01:27] <dunpeal> oh hai!  anyone knows if I can use jQuery.ui with jQuery 2?
[17:02:26] <coldhead> it's fine with me if you do, dunpeal
[17:10:16] <dunpeal> coldhead: thanks for the permission! do you know if it will work, though?
[17:11:50] <coldhead> i don't see anything on their site to say it won't work
[17:11:57] <coldhead> and i feel like they'd tell you if it was an issue
[17:12:17] <coldhead> might be one of those try it and see scenarios i keep hearing about
[17:12:31] <dunpeal> coldhead: I'm asking since the default packages ships with 1.9.1
[17:13:16] <dunpeal> coldhead: kinda doubt it is one of those, actually
[17:13:38] <dunpeal> given that I don't have the time or resources to test that particular combination in every freaking browser in the universe just now
[17:14:17] <coldhead> fair point
[17:15:13] <coldhead> is there any particular reason to use jq2?
[17:15:35] <coldhead> seeing as it won't work in old IEs
[17:16:33] <dunpeal> we're already not supporting old IEs, so if jq2 offers any benefit for dropping that support, I'd take it

Any suggestions what does the best performance?

[18:46:29] <Velveeta> if you do `api with a command and then @ their name, it'll do it
[18:46:40] <Velveeta> `api trigger @olarf
[18:46:40] <b-ot> olarf: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[18:49:31] <andrew9183> `api deferred @olarf
[18:49:31] <b-ot> olarf: No matches.
[18:50:12] <olarf> hehe i dont know if this is what i wanted but nice gimmik ^^
[18:50:49] <olarf> Velveeta: thats what i was searching
[18:52:02] <olarf> anyways just for your entertainment here is "tables" question:  http://jsfiddle.net/PwFac/4/   <-- why is this working for the last tr when it doesn't have 'id' tag?
[18:54:17] <Velveeta> i'm not sure why that :hover rule is working on anything other than the first tr
[18:54:31] <Velveeta> id's are supposed to be unique in the document, that rule should only be matching the first one
[18:55:02] <Velveeta> it's probably only a quirk that it's working for more than the first row, not sure why it's not working for the last
[18:55:09] <Velveeta> you should switch that from an id attribute to a class
[18:55:35] <olarf> this is not my question ^^ it was from the user named "table"
[18:55:37] <Velveeta> oh i see why it wasn't working for the last, that one didn't have an id
[18:55:43] <Velveeta> ohhhhh ok gotcha
[18:55:49] <olarf> this fiddle is full of wrongness ^^
[18:56:15] <Velveeta> absolutely
[18:56:16] <olarf> good by :) going to bad now
[18:56:41] <olarf> its 4am sorry for my englisch
[18:56:48] <Velveeta> adios
[19:37:22] <aboudreault> should my .removeProp() delete completely the attribute from the tag? looks like it only remove the value.
[19:37:57] <coldhead> i feel like it should remove the property all together
[19:38:01] <coldhead> oh wait
[19:38:06] <coldhead> you probably want removeAttr
[19:38:10] <coldhead> for an attribute
[19:38:35] <aboudreault> coldhead, well, I use .prop to set the property
[19:40:27] <aboudreault> coldhead, ok, it worked with removeAttr. thx
[19:40:34] <coldhead> YOU ARE WELCOME

[23:52:18] <d32> ie 11 doesn't support onreadystatechange anymore it says use onload if I attach the jquery .load to a iframe with pdf it never gets called does anyone have experience with this?
[23:53:29] <libin> hello, can someone please advice me on how i could save an image/video from a json. it got to be saved in html storage for offline access
[23:57:39] <Cork> <_<
[23:57:41] <Cork> uhh...
[23:57:54] <Cork> store a video in localstorage...
[23:58:03] <Cork> libin: i would VERY much recommend not do to that
[23:58:13] <Cork> use the browsers cache or the offline storage
[23:58:56] <Cork> libin: meaning send the video as an url in the json and then just make a normal request when you want to use it (in <video> or what ever)
[23:59:43] <d32> ie 11 jquery ready fires but .load not for a pdf in a iframe why?
