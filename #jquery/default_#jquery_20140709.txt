[01:15:13] <marcules> Good Morning :)
[01:15:24] <soee> hi, what would be the best way to detect value change in container ?
[01:15:48] <Cork> soee: "value change"?
[01:15:52] <Cork> and what is "container"?
[01:16:29] <soee> Cork: it can be  p, span, div ; now if its content is changed i need to show/hide other element
[01:16:52] <Cork> so by "value change" you mean dom modifications?
[01:17:33] <soee> Cork: in this particular case, only some text is changed
[01:17:58] <Cork> soee: you can use MutationObserver if your ok with demanding ie >= 11
[01:18:05] <Cork> if not, then no, you can't
[01:18:15] <soee> ie 7+ here
[01:18:20] <Cork> then no you can't
[01:18:36] <Cork> have script that modifies the text call a function you can handle
[01:18:52] <Cork> or have it fire a custom event
[01:23:59] <nikio_> hey, why doesnt this work? http://pastie.org/9370788
[01:24:42] <Cork> define work
[01:24:57] <Cork> or rather define "doesn't work"
[01:26:20] <nikio_> Cork my textbox doesnt resize
[01:26:40] <Cork> nikio_: make a jsfiddle
[01:26:50] <nikio_> 80.114.129.20
[01:26:55] <nikio_> thats my website
[01:26:59] <nikio_> on my laptop
[01:27:17] <nikio_> hmm a jsfiddle you say o0
[01:27:32] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2F80.114.129.20%2Fstock%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:27:52] <Cork> fix your html, and we can try again
[01:28:10] <Cork> and when you're at it add a doctype
[01:28:20] <nikio_> Cork ok but http://stackoverflow.com/a/2948256
[01:28:23] <Cork> i'm not into debugging tagsoupe
[01:28:24] <nikio_> its just that plugin
[01:28:37] <Cork> doens't really matter
[01:28:40] <Cork> your page is broken
[01:28:44] <Cork> so ya, things break
[01:28:51] <nikio_> hmm broken ? o9
[01:28:58] <Cork> check the link i posted
[01:29:01] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2F80.114.129.20%2Fstock%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:29:09] <Cork> make it validate and we can have a go at it
[01:30:57] <nikio_> ok
[01:31:17] <|RicharD|> hi
[01:31:28] <nikio_> well I used to use all the other tags too, but since its 2014 and pages work without it, I didnt see the point of leaving them in
[01:31:59] <Cork> nikio_: except you develop pre standard quirk mode pages
[01:32:17] <Cork> nikio_: you get legacy mode in browsers
[01:33:07] <Cork> so ya, there are large reasons to have valid html pages
[01:33:38] <nikio_> ok
[01:37:39] <nikio_> Cork that validator is very strict, it even requires an action specified on the form if you want it to POST data to the its own page
[01:38:12] <nikio_> and it requires column and rows specified on the textarea
[01:39:27] <systemfault> nikio_: Just open your js console...
[01:39:33] <systemfault> nikio_: Read the errors… fix them
[01:39:59] <systemfault> nikio_: When no red messages appear in the JS console, your stuff will work
[01:40:21] <systemfault> Using a jquery plugin without first loading jquery doesn’t help.
[01:41:17] <systemfault> And your server doesn’t handle 404s correctly… the plugin isn’t found.
[01:41:49] <nikio_> i dont have a js console
[01:42:03] <systemfault> nikio_: ID you use a modern browser, you have one.
[01:42:08] <systemfault> *If
[01:42:13] <nikio_> ok
[01:44:31] <nikio_> systemfault,  http://pastie.org/9370837
[01:44:40] <nikio_> still doesnt work though
[01:45:01] <systemfault> Did you fix the path to the plugin too?
[01:46:06] <nikio_> its in the same folder as my index.php systemfault
[01:46:58] <nikio_> hmmm
[01:47:00] <systemfault> It’s not found.. http://80.114.129.20/stock/jquery.autogrow-textarea.js
[01:47:10] <systemfault> Load that url… that’s supposed to be a JS plugin.
[01:47:16] <systemfault> Does that look like JS to you?
[01:49:18] <nikio_> systemfault, yeah i must have saved the page instead of the plugin thanks systemfault
[01:49:26] <nikio_> :]
[01:49:52] <systemfault> :)
[01:51:22] <nikio_> systemfault you can modify what it says on the page : ] 80.114.129.20
[01:51:29] <nikio_> write a message
[01:51:34] <nikio_> :]
[01:52:46] <nikio_> :]
[01:52:48] <nikio_> OMG
[01:55:04] <nikio_> systemfault, are you good at this shit
[01:55:05] <nikio_> ?
[01:55:16] <systemfault> What shit?
[01:55:30] <nikio_> webdesign serverside scripting etc
[01:55:46] <systemfault> I think I am.
[01:55:54] <systemfault> Why?
[01:56:19] <nikio_> systemfault, can you give me an intersting task you think will make the website better?
[01:57:37] <systemfault> I wouldn’t know… I would make my own website if I were you. To promote yourself as a frontend. It’s also a great opportunity to learn
[01:59:48] <nikio_> systemfault, this is my own right ?
[02:00:34] <systemfault> What do you mean?
[02:01:28] <nikio_> well make your own you said
[02:01:36] <nikio_> doing that right, its my own
[02:01:50] <nikio_> 80.114.129.20
[02:02:45] <hailwood> Hey guys, I have a form that has inputs that are named like so <input type="text" name="pet[1][age]" /> This works fine when I submit the form to the server as php turns it into a multidimensional array, but in jQuery if I try $form.serializeArray() then I get an object where the keys are the entire name instead of it breaking down properly, how can I get it to break down correctly?
[02:03:50] <sacho> by writing your own serializer
[02:04:12] <sacho> there might be a ready plugin for it. *shrug*
[02:04:56] <hailwood> Yeah, I was hoping there was one already, or that I could pass an option to serializeArray but if not that's coo
[02:04:58] <hailwood> '*cool
[02:22:25] <nikio_> systemfault, you think this is a good tutorial on how to make a forum?
[02:22:25] <nikio_> http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-phpmysql-powered-forum-from-scratch--net-10188
[02:24:00] <systemfault> I would start by learning PHP
[02:24:10] <systemfault> That doc looks “meh..."
[02:24:26] <systemfault> If you can, learn PDO instead of the mysql_* crap
[02:30:31] <nikio_> systemfault, I learn php by working with it
[02:40:36] <nikio_> systemfault, do you use github or something to back up websites you work on
[02:40:37] <nikio_> ?
[02:42:15] <NCS_One> hi
[02:42:59] <NCS_One> on javascript if I have a string like "some text 1 some text" how can I replace the 1 by a 2?
[02:43:14] <NCS_One> ohh wait
[02:43:39] <NCS_One> it shouldnt be replace, I need to add 1 to the number n string
[02:46:43] <el_inventor> Good morning
[02:47:29] <el_inventor> Is there anyone here?
[02:53:52] <el_inventor> Is there anyone here?
[02:59:25] <Cork> ?ask
[02:59:35] <Cork> oh, lovely the bot is dead
[02:59:46] <Cork> el_inventor: if you have question, ask it
[02:59:49] <Cork> or you won't get a replay
[03:00:19] <xkr47> :)
[03:03:23] <el_inventor> ok, Is there anyone here?
[03:03:34] <el_inventor> sorry.
[03:03:40] <el_inventor> ok, How I can stop the execution of a function?
[03:04:43] <el_inventor> example....I'm playing a sound, how do I stop it?
[03:06:08] <el_inventor> know the function stop () but, I see that is only used on a selector
[03:06:45] <el_inventor> I do not know how to apply it with a sound
[03:54:35] <SprksDEV> how do I send ajax call to an api and get the json result returned?
[04:04:16] <Alina-malina>    $(".ticket_return").empty();  when i click on element, it just remove all buttons., how to do this to just remove only the clicked element?
[04:07:37] <FarLight> Do you know how you attached them?
[04:07:42] <FarLight> Did you use .on?
[04:07:53] <Alina-malina> what?
[04:08:19] <FarLight> Oh sorry
[04:08:22] <Alina-malina> i have many elements with same class, so when i click first element to empty it emtpy all elements
[04:08:23] <Alina-malina> :-/
[04:08:24] <FarLight> I thought you wanted to remove click events
[04:08:31] <Alina-malina> no
[04:08:52] <FarLight> $(this).hide();
[04:09:22] <Alina-malina> where to pass the class name .ticket_return?
[04:09:49] <FarLight> How are you binding the click event to the elements?
[04:09:56] <Alina-malina>  $.post("page/return_ticket", $(this).serialize(),
[04:10:07] <Alina-malina> ...
[04:10:43] <FarLight> $(".ticket_return").click(function() { $(this).hide(); });
[04:11:29] <Alina-malina> erm
[04:11:31] <Alina-malina> nah
[04:11:32] <Alina-malina> this is not it
[04:11:45] <FarLight> can you paste your code somewhere, I am guessing what you want
[04:11:52] <Alina-malina> k
[04:12:29] <Alina-malina> FarLight, http://pastebin.com/L9e8Wn7Q
[04:13:17] <Alina-malina> erm
[04:13:28] <Cork> Alina-malina: i think what you want is $(this).remove()
[04:13:51] <Cork> if you really want to remove the element that is
[04:14:03] <Cork> and not just hide it temporally
[04:14:13] <Alina-malina> no it doesnt work
[04:14:38] <Cork> also where do you have the "clicked" element?
[04:14:46] <Cork> this is an ajax call
[04:14:51] <Cork> not an event handler
[04:14:51] <Alina-malina> just a moment
[04:15:03] <Alina-malina> http://pastebin.com/PY661Dsp  here
[04:15:07] <FarLight> Hey cork how are you
[04:15:07] <Alina-malina> the full function
[04:15:15] <Cork> FarLight: i'm fine
[04:15:26] <Cork> semester in 2 weeks :D
[04:15:40] <FarLight> are you in australasia somewhere?
[04:15:47] <Cork> FarLight: sweden
[04:16:06] <FarLight> Nice
[04:16:13] <Cork> Alina-malina: so you want to remove the submit button that triggered the form submission?
[04:16:55] <Alina-malina> well i want to change the html inside, but it doesnt even work with empty, it does remove all buttons with same class name
[04:17:17] <Cork> Alina-malina: well i'm still trying to figure out what you have
[04:17:26] <Alina-malina> there are buttons with same class
[04:17:29] <Cork> Alina-malina: so you have multiple submit buttons in the same form?
[04:17:32] <Alina-malina> yes
[04:17:35] <SprksDEV> nothing happens http://pastie.org/private/zsrl8zraijt4krnwxzcq
[04:17:46] <Cork> Alina-malina: then you're kinda out of luck
[04:17:53] <Alina-malina> O_o
[04:18:04] <Cork> Alina-malina: browsers doesn't provide a way to identify what submit button triggered the submit event
[04:18:12] <Cork> well mozilla does
[04:18:15] <Alina-malina> :-/
[04:18:15] <FarLight> Does submit give you a this?
[04:18:16] <Cork> but they are the only one
[04:18:27] <Cork> FarLight: this is the form, not the button
[04:18:35] <FarLight> ah
[04:18:50] <Alina-malina> it is button in the form
[04:19:28] <Alina-malina> i mean <td class = "ticket_return"></td>
[04:19:36] <Alina-malina> i need to change what is inside
[04:19:41] <Alina-malina> but only for the element that i clicked
[04:20:08] <Cork> Alina-malina: what you can do is something like $().submit().on('click', 'input[type="submit"]', { $(this).addClass('active').closest('form').find('input[type="submit"]').not(this).removeClass('active'); })
[04:20:14] <antlong> Hello, I need help figuring out the most efficient way to add a title to about 12-13 elements. http://jsfiddle.net/G4HdJ/
[04:20:23] <Cork> and then check for the button with the active class in the submit event
[04:20:37] <Alina-malina> ok let me figure out this just a moment
[04:21:17] <Cork> antlong: :contains('accuracy') is about as inefficient as you can make it
[04:21:44] <antlong> Cork I have the names of all of them, I just can't figure out the right way to define the titles, since I just dump them right in to a table.
[04:22:58] <Cork> antlong: could you set a class from where ever you generate the table?
[04:23:01] <FarLight> What do you want to set the title to?
[04:23:46] <Cork> cause then you could do $('#panel td.the-class').closest('tr').prop('title', 'Foo')
[04:24:03] <antlong> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/G4HdJ/1/
[04:24:19] <Cork> ah
[04:24:53] <FarLight> You want to add a custom tool tip for each
[04:24:55] <FarLight> ?
[04:24:56] <Cork> antlong: uh, and how is that generating the html?
[04:25:13] <FarLight> Something like "attack: amount of damage dealt"?
[04:25:25] <antlong> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/G4HdJ/2/
[04:25:29] <antlong> FarLight right
[04:25:57] <FarLight> You should link the description and elements together first
[04:26:31] <Cork> antlong: so in the y.push line
[04:26:36] <Cork> add a class too
[04:26:48] <Cork> <tr class="' + value + '"
[04:27:00] <Cork> then you can quite easily do what you want
[04:27:17] <antlong> oh right
[04:27:27] <Cork> $('#panel tr.accuracy').prop('title', 'Foo')
[04:27:46] <antlong> with tooltipster i can pass the content in when i call the tooltip function
[04:28:20] <Cork> antlong: it might take a function too, and that is prob the cleanest solution
[04:55:01] <SprksDEV> This doesn't do anything. Why? http://pastie.org/private/8k0qbp7czgjrzmfj0wqsg
[04:55:46] <Cork> SprksDEV: attach a fail/error callback
[04:56:08] <flam_> you forgot comma after success
[04:56:30] <Cork> ugg, so check your browser console
[04:56:42] <SprksDEV> how'd I do that?
[04:56:59] <Cork> ctrl+shift+j or ctrl+shift+k depending on the browser
[04:57:54] <rrn_> hello I am using a date pick jquery plugin and now I want to change it's date format and date separator
[04:58:04] <SprksDEV> okay, that worked. at least its getting called.
[04:58:06] <rrn_> can any one help me please
[04:58:32] <SprksDEV> but it didn't add the entry into my db table from the api  call.
[04:59:24] <rrn_> but while passing the url display "/"
[04:59:53] <rrn_> which I want to make it as mm-dd-yyyy
[05:00:09] <rrn_> instead of mm/dd/yy
[05:08:25] <SprksDEV> how do I get the json response for my ajax api request. I need to see what the problem is.
[05:08:50] <Cork> SprksDEV: check the network tab in the console
[05:45:38] <jaspertheghost> test
[06:42:43] <vmarcetic> Hi! Can anyone please help me with this. I want to find HR index in a #document wrapper but HR isn't direct child of #document
[06:43:16] <Cork> vmarcetic: make a fiddle with the code
[06:43:22] <vmarcetic> ok sure
[06:47:49] <vmarcetic> here it is
[06:47:50] <vmarcetic> http://jsfiddle.net/wMV63/
[06:48:06] <vmarcetic> I want to find position of hr inside that div
[06:53:10] <shoky> vmarcetic: its position in relation to what?  what number are you expecting in this fiddle
[06:53:27] <vmarcetic> in relation do #document
[06:53:38] <shoky> its inside #document
[06:53:53] <shoky> what number are you expecting here
[06:55:28] <Cork> i guess he wants the index of the child in #document
[06:55:33] <Cork> holding the hr element
[06:55:47] <vmarcetic> what do you mean what number? Isn't index supposed to give you the position of an element inside an container for example 10 20 30 or smth like that.
[06:55:48] <vmarcetic> yes
[06:55:53] <vmarcetic> the child element
[06:56:16] <shoky> heh, why can't you give the exact number for this specific example
[06:56:32] <Cork> so http://jsfiddle.net/wMV63/1/
[06:57:04] <shoky> see, 8, a specific number
[06:57:30] <vmarcetic> I din't know that
[06:57:32] <vmarcetic> sry
[06:58:03] <vmarcetic> ok thanks alot Cork and shoky I will try it out now
[06:58:07] <vmarcetic> a lot*
[06:58:24] <Cork> vmarcetic: while we're at it, some cleanup http://jsfiddle.net/wMV63/2/
[06:58:40] <Cork> always, always, always. always define your variables
[06:58:59] <vmarcetic> tnx
[06:59:09] <Cork> opps i saw wrong
[06:59:13] <Cork> they are defined...
[06:59:15] <Cork> sorry about that
[06:59:42] <vmarcetic> :D
[07:00:36] <Cork> vmarcetic: anyway $.map gives a nicer design then $.each with a .push in it
[07:01:01] <vmarcetic> yea I can see that, it is better
[07:01:04] <vmarcetic> tnx for that
[07:12:48] <dpiwowarski> Hi!
[07:15:42] <dpiwowarski> I'm doing $('div.some_class')[0].click(). It simulates the click on first div, after that some things happen, some ajax is called, all this trigger by this click. Is there a way to know when the chain of things started buy this click will finish?
[07:15:54] <ziikutv> Hi guys, comepletly new to web stuff and would really apreciate any help. I saw thissite that has this sexy animations.. it looks like they have jquery but HOW did they do the animations? www.atmospherejs.com (click the Search box to see what I mean OR press the A key and the "menu" will pop out)
[07:19:31] <BillCriswell> dpiwowarski: With the ajax call in there it might be a little tricky.
[07:19:59] <BillCriswell> If it wasn't for the ajax call I'd imagine a custom event and just wait for that custom event on document.
[07:20:43] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').trigger('click.track'); $(document).on('click.track', function () { /* Did all the click stuff! */ });
[07:21:32] <dpiwowarski> BillCriswell: thx, that's some start
[07:22:57] <BillCriswell> dpiwowarski: As for the ajax request maybe stop the propagation then in the success of the ajax call do $(this).trigger('click.track'); and have it continue again?
[07:23:05] <BillCriswell> This all feels weird, though, haha.
[07:24:05] <BillCriswell> Well, this being the element that's triggering the ajax request.. not this inside the callback of the ajax request since that wouldn't be the element.
[07:26:35] <Snacks> dpiwowarski: If you are completely new to web development, much less jQuery, you should probably do some tutorials, and come back and ask specific questions. For example: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/246701/jQuery-for-Beginners
[07:39:01] <EcoGiko> hello
[07:41:14] <EcoGiko> Is it possible to pass an even to a js function? I am trying to prevent the default behaviour on a form and I am doing it like so - https://dpaste.de/ZuqM
[07:41:25] <EcoGiko> I don't know how to pass the event to the function.
[07:42:08] <droid909> EcoGiko: like this $('#bla').on('click',function_name(event));
[07:42:22] <EcoGiko> I don't want to use a selector
[07:43:17] <EcoGiko> It's not that I don't want to rather than it will keep my code tidier and easier to read and I won't have to always come up with new ids
[07:46:40] <BillCriswell> EcoGiko: So you want to do like SendMessage.send(someFunction) ?
[07:46:57] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, exactly
[07:47:22] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, I want to do <form onclick="SendMessage.send(event)"/>
[07:47:29] <BillCriswell> The event would be the first argument in someFunction.
[07:47:56] <BillCriswell> so function someFunction (event) { event.preventDefault(); ... } would be how you definite someFunction.
[07:48:23] <BillCriswell> EcoGiko: You'd probably want to do $('form').on('submit', SendMessage.send);
[07:49:34] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, I'd like to avoid all the $('#ids') and element selectors, I can't quite grasp how events are passed. How should I go about modifying this snippet? - https://dpaste.de/ZuqM
[07:50:18] <sobhiu> http://jsfiddle.net/z467Y/
[07:50:27] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, I have already done it with selectors, it's quite easy, but the problem comes when I have multiple forms, elements, ids and they kinda overlap it it could get confusing
[07:50:27] <BillCriswell> EcoGiko: this inside of someFunction would be the form element that submitted.
[07:50:59] <sobhiu> If I need to use the tooltip outside of the moveTooltip function, how can I to access it?
[07:51:31] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, that kills the whole point of me trying to make it happen another way
[07:51:49] <BillCriswell> EcoGiko: You lost me.
[07:53:14] <BillCriswell> EcoGiko: http://jsbin.com/yisuyayo/1/edit?html,js,output does this help?
[07:53:28] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, I have this snippet - https://dpaste.de/ZuqM - I want to pass the event that submits it to the function. I am looking to pass the event like so -> onclick="SendMessage.send(event)
[07:53:40] <BillCriswell> Why?
[07:53:47] <BillCriswell> I am showing you how to do that.
[07:54:05] <BillCriswell> Look at the code I sent you.
[07:54:12] <EcoGiko> without this -> $('form').on('submit', SendMessage.send);
[07:54:18] <EcoGiko> no selectors
[07:54:28] <EcoGiko> I already have a solution with selectors
[07:54:32] <EcoGiko> I am looking to make it cleaner
[07:54:45] <BillCriswell> How do you want to attach events to elements without selecting them?
[07:55:29] <EcoGiko> BillCriswell, I don't really know, is it possible to di it?
[07:55:51] <sacho_> EcoGiko, you could use a parent element and attach a delegated handler.
[07:55:56] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what to say.
[07:57:13] <BillCriswell> EcoGiko: The event is the first argument to whatever function you use to handle it.
[08:00:27] <EcoGiko> I use onClick to handle the event
[08:00:32] <EcoGiko> or ?
[08:01:10] <BillCriswell> On click on a form would happen any time a user clicked the form, not when the form is submitted.
[08:03:06] <Criten> is there a way to get the data returned from a failed .post() request?
[08:03:13] <Criten> I want to return 400 when validation fails
[08:03:25] <Criten> and included in the response are the invalid fields
[08:03:43] <Criten> or do i need to pick a success code
[08:05:39] <BillCriswell> Criten: If you set the http headers to 400 it'll do the .fail
[08:06:05] <BillCriswell> The response code it more for if the request succeeds, not if there's was a user error.
[08:06:19] <BillCriswell> not if there was a user error*
[08:06:58] <sobhiu> http://jsfiddle.net/z467Y/
[08:07:11] <sobhiu> If I need to use the tooltip outside of the moveTooltip function, how can I to access it?
[08:10:37] <BillCriswell> sobhiu: You should define it outside of it first, but with your code you're creating a global in that function which you probbably don't mean to do. Basically with your code as long as you run moveTooltip first you can use tooltip anywhere you'd like.
[08:13:33] <albipri> Hi! Is it possible to catch the event of “cancel” button inside the dialog of a file upload?
[08:14:24] <sobhiu> BillCriswell : http://jsfiddle.net/XLRNh/
[08:14:39] <sobhiu> in that case how you will pass info to that object
[08:15:01] <sobhiu> if you will call it of this way :: tooltip.open();
[08:19:04] <BillCriswell> sobhiu: Yes.
[08:19:21] <BillCriswell> I think that was a yes or no question ahah
[08:19:34] <BillCriswell> decx: You still celebrating?
[08:20:48] <sobhiu> weren't question, honestly I have not idea how passs info to open function like that
[08:21:12] <BillCriswell> sobhiu: You can just do tooltip.open('some stuff')
[08:22:27] <sobhiu> into tooltip what i do?
[08:23:40] <BillCriswell> I'm not familiar with this plugin so I'm not sure. I'm taking a stab at how it works.
[08:26:15] <albipri> Hi! Is it possible to catch the event of “cancel” button inside the dialog of a file upload?
[08:50:34] <maxmoore14> in JQM, preventDefault is blocking some ui updates. Anyone know how I can better handle this situation so that ui-btn-down and active, and hover, and up, etc. all can applied correctly? http://jsbin.com/pogoveya/1/edit
[09:03:57] <decx> BillCriswell when i went down the street where people were celebrating yesterday night i scored faster than germany
[09:06:04] <BillCriswell> Are you saying you got laid?
[09:07:06] <decx> like the german national team i was thinking: this is too easy and double bagged
[09:12:11] <PantsOfChoco> like the german national team it probably wasnt consensual
[09:33:10] <Nubville> So if I have serveral elements on a page, and I want to set all of their heights, does each element need an id? or can you do something as simle as $(.someclass).css("height",foo);
[09:33:15] <mephx> hey guys. when body's overflow-y is set to scroll, and some other element's overflow-y is set to scroll, when scrolling inside the element is there a way to prevent scrolling the body when start/end scroll of overflown element has been reached? thanks!
[09:34:45] <duch_kazatel> Nubville you can target the class just fine.
[09:34:59] <duch_kazatel> the each is implied.
[09:36:47] <duch_kazatel> Nubville you can also do stuff like $('a, span').css('height', '1000000px'); - that'll work, too.
[09:38:07] <_biff> hi
[09:38:22] <_biff> is there a datepicker which gives back the day as a simple integer?
[09:38:47] <_biff> and of course i could set this selected date with this number
[09:38:47] <duch_kazatel> _biff almost all of them should be able to do that.
[09:39:01] <_biff> ok
[09:39:21] <Nubville> well i'm trying to build a responsive page where I need 9 elements to stay the same size so they float correctly, so i've written a for loop to check all their sizes and change all their sizes to match the largest div
[09:39:40] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to check any of their sizes.
[09:39:58] <duch_kazatel> no need to loop, either.
[09:40:01] <_biff> duch_kazatel do u have any proposition?
[09:40:16] <Nubville> duch_kazatel, whats a better way to do it?
[09:40:17] <duch_kazatel> _biff you mean suggestions?  any of them/
[09:40:18] <_biff> which wan could be the best
[09:40:21] <_biff> aha:)
[09:47:27] <kaspar_e> can anyone help me with qunit?
[09:48:01] <kaspar_e> is it possible to call the test() function in a for loop?
[09:48:11] <kaspar_e> to generate different tests?
[09:48:43] <kaspar_e> https://github.com/kasbah/1clickBOM/blob/feat-per-country-user-sim-test/chrome/coffee/tests/user_simulation.coffee
[09:48:54] <kaspar_e> doesn't seem to work for me
[10:24:39] <thebloggu> i'm using the sortable widget of jquery ui to implement drag and drop sorting of a table. i was able to implement it but now i want to sort multiple rows based on a checkbox on the row. i've put together the following test case (http://jsfiddle.net/xNVc6/1/) which doesn't work and has a comment of what i wanted to achieve. can someone help me?
[10:25:50] <Frazz> hi
[10:26:22] <Frazz> with a draggable, is it possible to set just the y axis of containment to 'parent?'
[10:30:16] <guzzlefry> quick question, can jquery-ui's selectmenu contain images?
[10:31:47] <guzzlefry> nevermind, it does
[10:45:55] <Nyoom> Why is "document.getElementsByClassName('.badge-warning[title="Reports"]')" not matching "<span class="badge badge-warning" title="Reports">1456</span>" ?
[10:46:02] <Nyoom> oh wc
[10:46:15] <kurion> Hi all, question regarding the function .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut). The documentation uses this code as an example: http://pastebin.com/f1ExcCj0
[10:46:30] <kurion> What I'm wondering is, wouldn't that example only be using one parameter, why does it not use two?
[10:48:11] <duch_kazatel> kurion what?
[10:48:43] <kurion> The documentation on the function .hover says that the header is: $( selector ).hover( handlerIn, handlerOut )
[10:48:48] <kurion> http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[10:49:08] <kurion> But in the example they give, they give a function for the first parameter, but nothing for the second
[10:49:15] <decx> well this paste is pointless because it only applies a mouseenter
[10:49:28] <kurion> That's what I was thinking
[10:49:34] <decx> it would be hover(function(){ .. }, function(){ .. })
[10:49:39] <duch_kazatel> decx that's from the docs
[10:49:40] <kurion> Okay, that's what I was hoping
[10:49:50] <duch_kazatel> i think that's them trying to demonstrate you can use it that way.
[10:49:58] <duch_kazatel> supplying one function is handlerInOut.
[10:50:09] <kurion> Oh, so I guess it's like shorthand?
[10:50:17] <duch_kazatel> scroll down a bit - you'll see it.
[10:50:23] <decx> you're better off setting mouseenter and mouseleave
[10:50:29] <duch_kazatel> the docs should have that one a little lower down for the example.
[10:50:41] <kurion> Oh I see it
[10:50:46] <kurion> Thanks all, was a bit lost there.
[10:51:04] <guzzlefry> Is anyone aware of any backward compatibility issues when going from jQuery UI 1.8.6 to the latest stable?
[10:51:55] <decx> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/
[10:52:07] <thebloggu> i was able to implement drag and drop sorting of a table with jquery ui's sortable. now I'd like to get multi row sorting. here is a test case with a comment explaining what i believe may be the solution http://jsfiddle.net/xNVc6/1/
[10:52:21] <antlong> when formatting html with content+= is there a good way to check if a <br> comes before?
[10:52:25] <thebloggu> can someone help me?
[10:52:32] <decx> already did
[10:53:13] <DarkSector_> Hey guys, can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/SNCuN/ When I check the main checkbox more than once, the others don't work after the first toggle.
[10:53:16] <DarkSector_> How do I fix it?
[10:53:26] <guzzlefry> well, that looks like a headache. :P
[10:53:51] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry it is :)
[10:53:54] <duch_kazatel> we just upgraded here.
[10:54:05] <thebloggu> decx: you're talking to me? sorry, not sure since i got disconnected for a while because my irc client crashed
[10:54:20] <decx> no
[10:54:27] <thebloggu> decx: oh, ok
[10:55:53] <decx> DarkSector_ use prop('checked',true) and prop('checked',false) instead of attr and removeattr. because once you remove the attribute there isnt any attribute to change anymore
[10:56:08] <DarkSector_> Okay let me try that
[10:56:28] <decx> also get rid of the each
[10:56:36] <decx> when you set .prop the each is implied
[10:56:51] <DarkSector_> Oh nice!
[10:57:00] <DarkSector_> It worked and let me remove each
[10:57:03] <DarkSector_> thanks decx
[10:57:47] <kurion> Just a bit of a sidenote: I ran both forms of .hover . And the one with one parameter did its effect twice.
[10:58:01] <kurion> Changed it to the form with two parameters and only ran its effect once.
[11:00:53] <joesmith> is there a way to iterate over jquery objects and return a list of the results? this returns a string of each td's text, but i want a list:
[11:00:53] <joesmith> $('#multiClusterDashBoardTable').find('tbody').find('tr').find('td:eq(1)').text()
[11:01:33] <duch_kazatel> joesmith the jquery object is array-like.
[11:01:39] <duch_kazatel> joesmith what specifically are you trying to do in this case?
[11:01:54] <joesmith> i simply want the text of each td, but in a list i can iterate over
[11:02:04] <decx> use $.map()
[11:02:35] <decx> var textarray = $(mytds).map(function(){ return $(this).text() }
[11:03:29] <joesmith> perfect: $('#multiClusterDashBoardTable').find('tbody').find('tr').find('td:eq(1)').map( function () { return $(this).text() })
[11:03:32] <joesmith> thanks decx!
[11:03:33] <damasceno> Hello. How can I clear a modal dialog when the user clicks on the close button? It closes but when I open it again it shows all the fields with data. thanks.
[11:09:47] <DarkSector_> I had another question regarding the checkbox issue. How do I associate the ID or name of a text input with a checkbox. Like you use `for` attribute in <label> tag
[11:10:21] <DarkSector_> What I am trying to do is get the id of the input associated with a checkbox and disable it if checkbox isn't checked
[11:12:54] <zizzy> how come an empty string is considered invalid JSON
[11:15:20] <duch_kazatel> zizzy because an empty string isn't a collection of name/value pairs.
[11:17:40] <arthurvr> An empty JSON object will return an empty object, but indeed an empty string is invalid JSON
[11:18:05] <zizzy> where does it say that JSON has to be a collection of name-value pairs?
[11:18:45] <arthurvr> It doesnt have to be a collection of name-value pairs..
[11:19:35] <arthurvr> Just '{}' is valid too. http://jsfiddle.net/UG2XW/1/
[11:20:02] <duch_kazatel> "An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace). Each name is followed by : (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by , (comma)."
[11:20:03] <zizzy> arthurvr: i know {} and [] are both valid but does anyone have a reference to where this standard is defined
[11:20:06] <duch_kazatel> json.org
[11:20:24] <duch_kazatel> also: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf
[11:21:20] <arthurvr> I checked it with http://jsonlint.com/
[11:22:43] <zizzy> i just skimmed it but i don't see anything there that explicitly forbids an empty sting being valid JSON
[11:23:09] <duch_kazatel> zizzy i pasted the relevant bit from json.org - specifically: "An object begins with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace)."
[11:23:11] <decx> it also didnt say that a watermelon isnt valid
[11:23:20] <duch_kazatel> '' != {}
[11:23:59] <zizzy> duch_kazatel: sure but this is valid as well []
[11:24:09] <duch_kazatel> actually i'm not sure that is per spec.
[11:24:21] <duch_kazatel> in javascript, [] is an object, either way.
[11:24:26] <duch_kazatel> though note JSON is not JavaScript.
[11:24:59] <zizzy> i feel like they should mention this explicitly
[11:25:18] <duch_kazatel> then they should also not that you cannot use a watermelon
[11:25:55] <zizzy> i disagree...
[11:25:57] <arthurvr> Indeed It shoud be mentioned on json.org
[11:26:18] <NoiseEee> "JSON is built on two structures:"
[11:26:21] <NoiseEee> find that on json.org.
[11:26:22] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[11:26:37] <duch_kazatel> looks like [] is valid for open/close.
[11:26:58] <MDesigner> hey, has anyone else noticed that $.focus() (as a trigger, not an event) does not work in Firefox?
[11:27:10] <MDesigner> it used to
[11:27:33] <MDesigner> case in point: http://mailinator.com/
[11:27:40] <MDesigner> that box auto focuses in every browser except Firefox
[11:27:55] <duch_kazatel> the "check an inbox" box?
[11:28:22] <duch_kazatel> MDesigner ^
[11:28:36] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: yep. also http://hashmy.pw (the domain box is supposed to aotu focus)
[11:28:47] <duch_kazatel> it autofocuses for me on mailinator
[11:28:48] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: ooops.. never mind. it's not a jQuery prob.
[11:28:58] <arthurvr> Just checked in FF30 (mac) and it autofocuses
[11:29:02] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: it's a Firefox issue. cuz mailinator uses HTML5 to autofocus
[11:29:08] <MDesigner> arthurvr: really? I'm on v30 on Mac as well
[11:29:14] <MDesigner> maybe I need to totally wipe out my Firefox install
[11:29:35] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery?
[11:29:55] <arthurvr> 1.8.1
[11:29:55] <MDesigner> unsure
[11:30:18] <duch_kazatel> kay.  either way, those worked in FF for me.
[11:30:31] <MDesigner> ok. thanks for checking
[11:30:33] <MDesigner> seems my FF install is hosed
[11:30:57] <damasceno> How can I destroy the modal data when the user clicks on the Close button?
[11:31:17] <duch_kazatel> damasceno depends on the modal and the data
[11:31:38] <duch_kazatel> damasceno if you're talking about inputs, you could .each() through them and set their .val() to an empty string or something.
[11:32:15] <decx> the css on that mailinator site is massive damn
[11:32:21] <decx> 250kb
[11:32:48] <damasceno> duch_kazatel: got it but I'm actually looking for another solutions like the .destroy method. :S
[11:34:52] <duch_kazatel> damasceno then you'll have to remove it and reinitialize the modal.
[11:50:51] <midwestward> hello, is there an easy way to sync a jquery .sortable() list to another list (aside from writing a callback to manipulate the other list)?
[11:51:53] <midwestward> hm, nm just saw connectWith
[11:55:37] <DarkSector_> Why can't I redefine variable text_input_id in this code? http://jsfiddle.net/SNCuN/1/
[11:55:44] <DarkSector_> And why doesn't it seem to work?
[11:56:52] <duch_kazatel> because text_input_id in the .change() is different than the one in the .each()
[11:57:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/SNCuN/2/ this more clearly shows what you're doing.
[11:57:58] <duch_kazatel> do you want text_input_id to be shared across all of this code?
[12:02:50] <mbrzuzy> Hi guys, does anyone have a drag & drop file upload they can recommend?
[12:03:43] <duch_kazatel> i hate mootools more and more every day
[12:09:25] <decx> DarkSector_ get rid of all that duplication http://jsfiddle.net/decx/SNCuN/3/
[12:09:52] <decx> missed on attr damnit... /4 it is then
[12:09:55] <decx> one*
[12:20:56] <guzzlefry> So, I think I understand attr() vs. prop()... .prop() is for boolean-type attributes while attr() is for the others?
[12:21:05] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:21:18] <duch_kazatel> .prop() edits the underlying DOM.  .attr() edits the markup.
[12:21:29] <duch_kazatel> 99% of the time, you want .prop()
[12:21:52] <guzzlefry> weird...
[12:22:07] <guzzlefry> So why is .prop('data-url') returning undefined?
[12:22:34] <duch_kazatel> because you want .data('url')
[12:23:03] <guzzlefry> heh :)
[12:23:03] <guzzlefry> thanks
[12:23:05] <decx> data-* attributes get stored in a datalist property
[12:23:10] <decx> or something like that
[12:23:14] <guzzlefry> Had no idea.
[12:23:15] <jaspertheghost> $.post( "http://website.com/ts/droid_backend.php?udid=00000000-70eb-f0c0-9dc4-521916d4a740&getalerts=1", { 'jobs[]': JSON.stringify(data) } )      i know im using JSON.strionfy wrong here ... data is an array  how can i pass it properly here?
[12:40:29] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: Where are you getting data from?
[12:40:44] <jaspertheghost> i figured it out ... im just so burnt out right now i cant rhink straight
[12:40:56] <jaspertheghost> var data = [];
[12:40:57] <jaspertheghost> data[0] = '107463';
[12:40:58] <jaspertheghost> var stringData = {};
[12:40:59] <jaspertheghost> stringData['jobs[]'] = data;
[12:44:23] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: Can't help but feel like something is being over complicated there.
[12:45:55] <jaspertheghost> build an object to pass to .ajax    the recievding end i want to recieve the data as an array
[12:48:35] <MeXTuX> I have a form inside a lightbox. Is there a way to prevent page redirection after submitting the form? (without using AJAX or iframes). Tnx.
[12:49:10] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: If you were to do var data = $form.serializeArray(); you can push items onto that like data.push({name: "jobs[]", value: "another item" });
[12:51:12] <jaspertheghost> Bill that only works on forms no?
[12:51:15] <mdev> does anyone know what graph this is using https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd
[12:51:25] <mdev> can't seem to find it in the source, flot or anything else
[12:52:10] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: Well $.post() could take the array even if you just want to use it in a post.
[12:52:22] <jaspertheghost> and the oject im creating doesnt have name=blah value=blah literals in the sense of the object x.name x.value  its literally   data.job[] = ['12345',12345']
[12:52:50] <BillCriswell> like $.post('/foo', [ {name: "foo[]", value: "foo" }, {name: "foo[]", value: "bar" } ])
[12:53:55] <jaspertheghost> Pass arrays of data to the server    has to be in the format -> 1    $.post( "test.php", { 'choices[]': [ "Jon", "Susan" ] } );
[12:54:16] <jaspertheghost> im satisfieing that
[12:54:51] <BillCriswell> Yeah either would work.
[12:54:55] <jaspertheghost> in php i can then do $arr = $_POST['choices']
[12:55:03] <jaspertheghost> foreach (arr as x) { etc ...
[12:55:44] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: Right, same thing with the way I showed. Either will get you there.
[12:56:14] <jaspertheghost> ahh ok
[12:56:29] <BillCriswell> Your way wasn't overcomplicated originally. I think I'm just cranky and tired.
[12:56:49] <jaspertheghost> lol i feel ya im at the point where i can barely code
[12:57:10] <BillCriswell> I want to code... just not what I'm being paid to code.
[12:57:15] <jaspertheghost> haha
[12:57:30] <jaspertheghost> what im making i should have asked for 50% more at the very least
[12:57:46] <jaspertheghost> next time i make an android app/web app ill know
[12:57:58] <BillCriswell> Word.
[12:58:01] <jaspertheghost> what project are you working on?
[12:58:57] <BillCriswell> Our company site.
[12:59:03] <BillCriswell> Fonts are being dicks.
[12:59:17] <BillCriswell> Too tired to care right now, though.
[12:59:20] <jaspertheghost> you should use webfonts i always wanted to use webfonts
[12:59:31] <jaspertheghost> and using vector fonts or something like that too
[12:59:59] <BillCriswell> We are. There's just something weird going on with the font css stuff that's causing .dev to get different font files than .com.
[13:00:27] <jaspertheghost> cahcing has been my issue got dan firefox like to cache
[13:00:37] <jaspertheghost> chrome too, i always gotta view pages in incognito
[13:01:28] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost: There's an option is Chrome Devtools to disable cache while the dev tools are open.
[13:01:34] <BillCriswell> Click the little cog looking thingie.
[13:01:50] <jaspertheghost> ill check that out
[13:06:28] <DarkSector_> decx: wow, that's some good code

[14:32:07] <duch_kazatel> adamellsworth http://fixee.org/paste/gvqwqns/#url=ph0w8zp
[14:32:49] <duch_kazatel> even better, set display: none; in your CSS on those two classes, then you can ditch line 3.
[14:33:46] <duch_kazatel> then your JS is just this: http://fixee.org/paste/gvqwqns/#url=b744ldi
[14:34:55] <decx> why do all these fixees look the same?
[14:35:05] <decx> ah, js
[14:35:24] <duch_kazatel> D:
[14:39:53] <decx> but in that you hide all
[14:40:05] <decx> in the original it's switching
[14:40:12] <decx> hide one show the other
[14:40:25] <duch_kazatel> oh not paying attention. you're right.
[14:41:14] <decx> i'd say add an active thing class to the parent and do the rest with css .media, .live { display: none } .media-active .media { display: block } ...
[14:49:36] <Ownix> How do I get at variables inside the caller function of my $.post? http://pastie.org/private/skohfyhuecr1mtrhi45ua
[14:49:58] <Ownix> I know the .done(0 runs async so those variables are all undefined now, but I cant seem to figure out how to get at them
[14:53:41] <duch_kazatel> Ownix which variables?
[14:54:20] <Ownix> self.folderID = options.$trigger.data("folderId");
[14:54:41] <Ownix> works fine, however, options.$trigger == undefined inside the done() callback
[14:54:56] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: ^
[14:55:48] <duch_kazatel> those should be accessible just fine.  try to just do console.log(options.$trigger);
[15:03:12] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: got it working http://pastie.org/private/azufyhbbkvkkwentcc4ryw
[15:03:22] <Ownix> Is there a better solution to line 4 duch_kazatel ?
[15:03:55] <duch_kazatel> .find('a p small')
[15:06:29] <midwestward> $($("#allphotos div")[indexBefore]).insertBefore( $($("#allphotos div")[indexAfter])); < I am finding the display does not update after executing this, can you tell what I am doing wrong?
[15:07:06] <duch_kazatel> first of all do $("#allphotos div").eq([indexBefore])
[15:07:11] <duch_kazatel> same with that other one.
[15:07:34] <duch_kazatel> second - any errors in the console?
[15:10:34] <midwestward> duch_kazatel, made that change thanks. no errors though
[15:10:58] <duch_kazatel> and you're sure those are selecting elements?
[15:15:49] <midwestward> duch_kazatel, good catch. there were some empty divs in the list that were being selected instead. thanks
[15:16:19] <Pinchiukas> I'm requesting data from a html page with an ajax call. And from a large html page with tables I need to extract some data. What would be the best way to do that?
[15:16:35] <duch_kazatel> define "extract"
[15:16:56] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas if you want to parse use YQL
[15:16:59] <Pinchiukas> The page has some data of interest in the tables. I don't know how to be more specific. :)
[15:17:07] <EminenceHC> I am using  Foo.attr('checked', true); It checks the value as expected but why does it not fire a separate OnChange I have watching that field?
[15:17:13] <duch_kazatel> if you just want to select the tables, you can go that Pinchiukas.
[15:17:30] <frank_o> Hello! Why would one want `event.preventDefault();` in a click / mobile touch indicator like this? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/LnhrF/9/
[15:17:36] <duch_kazatel> if you want to actually dump through them and get some, say JSON, that's doable to, though a little awkward.
[15:18:05] <duch_kazatel> frank_o to prevent the button's default action from firing if it has one.
[15:18:13] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC use .prop() first.
[15:18:25] <duch_kazatel> second, you might need to manually .trigger('change') instead.
[15:18:42] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Use .prop where?
[15:18:50] <duch_kazatel> instead of .attr()
[15:18:54] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ah ok
[15:18:56] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Why would one want to do that for a case like this click indicator? Wouldn't one want the click to happen normally except for the little sparkly indicator adding a bit of wow-factor?
[15:19:23] <duch_kazatel> frank_o perhaps there are other actions bound to that button they don't want to have happen, just in case.
[15:19:49] <guzzlefry> So, <select> element... When I click a different option the change event fires for it, but when I use the arrow keys to navigate it doesn't fire.
[15:19:53] <guzzlefry> Any workaround for that?
[15:20:01] <Pinchiukas> duch_kazatel: what do you mean?
[15:20:20] <guzzlefry> hm, maybe focus() with each <option>?
[15:20:36] <duch_kazatel> Pinchiukas do you need the data to be formatted any particular way?  or do you just want the HTML?
[15:20:47] <Pinchiukas> I have a table row and the second and third columns indicate to me that I want to print text in the first column in my own html. What would be the easiest way to do that?
[15:20:49] <frank_o> hmm.. cool..
[15:21:28] <duch_kazatel> Pinchiukas if you're using $.ajax(), just push the returned data into a fragment and select your data from there.
[15:21:39] <Pinchiukas> What's a fragment?
[15:22:14] <duch_kazatel> you can push that data into a fragment by doing something like .done(function(myData) { $(myData).find() });
[15:26:19] <Pinchiukas> What is this "$(myData)" thing?
[15:27:05] <guzzlefry> okay, so neither focus() nor select() work for <option> when using arrows to navigate.
[15:27:12] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas can you upload a sample code of what do you want to do?
[15:27:26] <duch_kazatel> that passes the data returned from the ajax call to jquery so you can run jquery methods against it.
[15:27:39] <Pinchiukas> thinkxl: I don't know how to do it so I can't produce a sample. :)
[15:27:43] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry it should fire change when you click somewhere else.
[15:27:59] <guzzlefry> ah okay, so it'll only fire when it loses focus?
[15:28:04] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry iirc yes.
[15:28:21] <guzzlefry> ah okay, that's less than ideal, but if it's what I have to work with. :P
[15:28:35] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas the html where the tables are, is inside your website?
[15:28:56] <Pinchiukas> It's on an intranet but it's a nagios status page if that tells you anything.
[15:28:57] <thinkxl> or is an external website?
[15:29:00] <duch_kazatel> Pinchiukas be aware you can't run ajax against an external site if they don't explicitly allow it.
[15:29:15] <Pinchiukas> I have permission.
[15:29:31] <duch_kazatel> i mean the server has to be enabled for it.
[15:29:34] <duch_kazatel> CORS
[15:29:36] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas CORS
[15:29:41] <duch_kazatel> unless it's the same domain, subdomain, and port
[15:29:45] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas do you have that kind of access?
[15:30:15] <Pinchiukas> The page has some other things and a table of three columns: service name, host status and service status. I want to look for rows with anything in bad shape and output the service name on my html.
[15:30:35] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, do what I said earlier.
[15:30:54] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas yes, do duch_kazatel stuff
[15:31:21] <Pinchiukas> Ah you mean there is protection from the sort of thing where I create an innocent page of kitten photos with malicious JS that DOS'es somebody?
[15:31:28] <duch_kazatel> err...
[15:31:32] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily.
[15:31:52] <duch_kazatel> it's so you can't create a page of innocent kitten photos and then access the users gmail inbox.
[15:32:04] <Pinchiukas> I can't do ajax calls to another domain or something? The html file will most likely be stored locally on the viewing computer.
[15:32:18] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[15:32:26] <duch_kazatel> "locally" as in "on the same hard drive"?
[15:32:29] <thinkxl> I don't understand
[15:32:30] <thinkxl> at all
[15:32:37] <duch_kazatel> or "locally" as in "Served up via the same server"?
[15:32:39] <Pinchiukas> Yeah, on my computer.
[15:32:49] <Pinchiukas> And it's going to request stuff from a remote server.
[15:32:54] <thinkxl> and the HTML is in another computer inside the intranet?
[15:32:57] <Pinchiukas> Will I run into problems with that?
[15:33:02] <Pinchiukas> Yes
[15:33:06] <duch_kazatel> yeah you might.
[15:33:13] <Pinchiukas> Another computer is a nagios server if that means anything.
[15:33:37] <Pinchiukas> I'll have to do a check.
[15:33:38] <thinkxl> don't you need to login to access the HTML with the tables?
[15:33:45] <duch_kazatel> http://fixee.org/paste/ehkzeda/
[15:33:49] <duch_kazatel> take a look at this.
[15:36:55] <Pinchiukas> I see what you meant: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[15:37:34] <thinkxl> Pinchiukas you can use YQL return the data as XML and use jQuery to grab it like this $(xml).find('table');
[15:38:22] <thinkxl> ajax > YQL > done(function(xml) { $(xml).doStuff(); });
[15:38:53] <thinkxl> You won't get cross domain issues that way
[15:39:28] <Pinchiukas> YQL is a JS script?
[15:39:42] <thinkxl> no is a service, let me grab an example
[15:40:09] <thinkxl> https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/#h=select+*+from+geo.places+where+text%3D%22san+francisco%2C+ca%22
[15:40:29] <thinkxl> go to the bottom where it says "THE REST QUERY" and do click on "How do I use this?"
[15:40:40] <thinkxl> you do an AJAX call to that url and use the data it gives you
[15:40:59] <thinkxl> YQL parses the URL and return you the HTML represented in XML, jQuery can grab xml and add methods to it
[15:41:57] <thinkxl> for example
[15:42:17] <thinkxl> try this on your browser
[15:42:19] <thinkxl> https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20html%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fjolv.me%22%20and%20compat%3D%22html5%22%20and%20xpath%3D'%2Fhtml'&diagnostics=true&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys
[15:42:33] <thinkxl> this will return you my website in xml, you can change my URL for the website you want to grab
[15:44:59] <Pinchiukas> I can't use external services unfortunately.
[15:45:05] <Pinchiukas> This is an isolated environment.
[15:45:07] <duch_kazatel> then you're hosed.
[15:45:10] <Pinchiukas> Data can't get outside.
[15:45:13] <duch_kazatel> unless you can setup a server
[15:45:27] <Pinchiukas> That would be just too much work. :)
[15:45:34] <duch_kazatel> you can't run an ajax request to that server,  you could ajax to your own box which requests to the other box then ships the data back.
[15:45:38] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you have no recourse.
[15:46:35] <Pinchiukas> Yeah, that kind of sucks... Well there might be a possibility that the server gives json output but that's not a solution to this problem...
[15:47:02] <Pinchiukas> I might be able to put my html on that server itself though...
[15:47:02] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[15:47:18] <duch_kazatel> if you can put it on that server at the same domain, subdomain, and port, that's doable.
[15:47:32] <Pinchiukas> Does it matter what I'm requesting if it's in another server than the html my script is running from?
[15:47:39] <copperhands> wut up
[15:47:39] <Pinchiukas> Yeah, exactly.
[15:48:02] <duch_kazatel> Pinchiukas if it's the same box, that's gravy, but if there's a JSON feed you can nab instead, use that.
[15:48:08] <duch_kazatel> helluvalot easier to manage.
[15:48:20] <Pinchiukas> duch_kazatel: won't I run into the same error I just copied?
[15:48:28] <duch_kazatel> "just copied"?
[15:48:34] <thinkxl> the cross domain one
[15:48:43] <Pinchiukas> "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."
[15:48:45] <duch_kazatel> oh - maybe, maybe not.  they might allow cross-domain JSON.
[15:48:56] <duch_kazatel> if they offer JSONP, you're fine.
[15:48:58] <thinkxl> if they offer JSON is for a reason
[15:49:00] <Pinchiukas> They meaning the browser security mechanisms?
[15:49:13] <duch_kazatel> they meaning "the site you're requesting from"
[15:49:34] <Pinchiukas> So THEY would have to be thoughtful enough to add the needed header.
[15:49:48] <duch_kazatel> that's not them being "thoughtful".
[15:49:49] <Pinchiukas> Sounds like a stretch to me... :/
[15:49:52] <duch_kazatel> that's them beind safe.
[15:50:48] <thinkxl> is like closing the door of your house, that keep thiefts outside
[15:51:01] <Pinchiukas> What is?
[15:51:05] <duch_kazatel> bad analogy.
[15:51:21] <thinkxl> you think? :/
[15:51:28] <Pinchiukas> It's like the sunset only green.
[15:52:26] <snover> it’s like having a tumour that makes it harder to pee and then your wife leaves you and then your dog gets the same cancer and dies
[15:53:26] <duch_kazatel> hur
[15:53:43] <thinkxl> is that one better? Heh
[15:53:45] <snover> then it turns out you actually didn’t have a dog in the first place and what is this animal doing here
[15:53:49] <duch_kazatel> not really lol
[15:54:34] <snover> all i know is i need to call animal control
[16:13:05] <PantsOfChoco> its like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
[16:14:07] <systemfault> Ahh… old Alanis Morisette songs..
[16:58:01] <duch_kazatel> \o/ i am almost done with the mootools abatement.
[16:58:37] <systemfault> Achievement Unlocked: Got rid of mootools in a big codebase!
[16:58:51] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Damn
[17:02:22] <duch_kazatel> this last file has been a nightmare.
[17:02:30] <duch_kazatel> and it's a super important one, too.
[17:05:30] <BillCriswell> Control+A, Del
[17:07:02] <duch_kazatel> we almost went there with it.
[17:07:30] <duch_kazatel> but the amount of stuff it's responsible for was a little more than I was comfortable with to go that far.
[17:08:15] <BillCriswell> Yeah, it always feels good throwing that idea at it though.
[17:08:50] <duch_kazatel> definitely. i hate to admit it, but I probably consider that about half the time.
[17:09:53] <BillCriswell> same
[17:29:30] <BillCriswell> Do you think a test to determine where your strengths are as a developer would be useful?
[17:34:55] <antlong> can anyone recommend a plugin, or a technique that would allow quick scrolling in a box or such, of information, with good performance? I need an activity log essentially, its to display actions in a game, and you can do around 5-10 actions per minute. Doesn't need to be a log, maybe activity lights?
[17:44:55] <jaspertheghost_> j #javascript
[17:45:44] <jaspertheghost_> so i am storing an object in localStorage and inside the “.done” function i can recall the data … outside it at you will below i get “null”
[17:45:44] <jaspertheghost_> http://pastebin.com/F8sd0Z8d
[17:45:48] <jaspertheghost_> anyone got any ideas?
[17:48:18] <jaspertheghost_> also if i assign data to another “global” variable i cant access it either ...
[17:50:22] <snover> `ajax101 @ jaspertheghost_
[17:50:22] <b-ot> jaspertheghost_: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41

[17:51:23] <jaspertheghost_> ahhh
[17:52:52] <jaspertheghost_> im retarded thanks for simple answer
[18:27:42] <jcool> I generated a dynamic table run time. It works perfectly well. but when I switch steps ( my form has steps 1 -2-3 so on) the rows are gone
[18:27:52] <jcool> how to preserve data and rows generated at runtime
[18:37:51] <superspring> BillCriswell: sounds like a good idea to me - although, perhaps either vague or ginormous...
[18:38:15] <BillCriswell> superspring: Yeah... it would be really tough haha
[18:38:49] <BillCriswell> superspring: http://scholasticadministrator.typepad.com/.a/6a00e54f8c25c98834017c317442ea970b-500wi would end up a situation like this
[18:40:36] <superspring> BillCriswell: true, though some level of standardised testing is good...
[18:40:47] <BillCriswell> superspring: Definitely.
[18:41:26] <BillCriswell> I'm taking tonight to understand git a little better. I almost think I understand it then I get lost again.
[18:42:08] <BillCriswell> I always think**
[18:42:41] <BillCriswell> Well, with a GUI it's easier to follow, but I want to understand the command line.
[18:44:57] <LoneStar99> howdy folks
[18:45:25] <BillCriswell> Ayyy
[18:52:34] <jaspertheghost_> http://pastebin.com/URwQ8rik  -> setAlertDivs is not working i get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o:1
[18:53:23] <jaspertheghost_> i think i know why
[18:54:31] <jaspertheghost_> got i nvm
[18:55:01] <jcool> how can we store table in sesion to access it back and forth?
[18:56:37] <LoneStar99> b
[18:57:16] <BillCriswell> jcool: Not sure I'm following you.
[18:57:52] <jcool> BillCriswell, I have a table. Users can add rows runtime , depending on how much rows they want
[18:58:16] <jcool> Once they are done they move to next step of form , but when they come back the state of table should be preserved
[18:58:29] <jcool> which isnt happening. all dynamically generated rows disappear.
[18:59:02] <jcool> BillCriswell, dynamic table: http://jsfiddle.net/jayesh92/N5SRE/2/
[19:00:02] <BillCriswell> jcool: You can store that data in localStorage or use ajax so you never actually leave the page. What happens in the next step?
[19:01:52] <jcool> BillCriswell, There are 4 steps. first is form. 2 ,3,4 are tables. and on 4th step they can submit
[19:02:56] <BillCriswell> What happens between 2, 3 and 4?
[19:04:46] <jcool> Step 2, table->Click on button you will be taken to step 3 which is a separate action
[19:04:51] <jcool> I am using cakephp framework
[19:08:39] <BillCriswell> jcool: Can you collect the data all at once and then submit it?
[19:09:02] <jcool> yes. the data gets stored in session as soon as you go to next step
[19:11:55] <BillCriswell> Why are the tables being added in three different steps? Hard time following things.
[19:12:50] <jcool> The form becomes lengthy and client doesnt want to make it messy, so he told to keep all tables on different step
[19:13:21] <jcool> lets say we keep all tables on page and then go to next page where some part of form is there and then come back
[19:13:28] <jcool> then also it will have same effect.
[19:13:41] <jcool> user can move to and fro between steps to check data
[19:15:01] <copperhands> anyone got any good fuck you pay me stories? a dev firm is giving me hell about hours worked and its stressing me out
[19:16:49] <BillCriswell> jcool: Can you paginate the tables in one step?
[19:17:14] <jcool> yes.
[19:17:19] <jcool> BillCriswell, yes
[19:19:44] <BillCriswell> jcool: Why not do that?
[19:21:49] <jcool> BillCriswell, Adding new rows to that paginate wont create hurdle?
[19:22:44] <BillCriswell> If the form doesn't get submitted I don't see why it would.
[19:24:24] <jcool> BillCriswell, cool.thanks.will give it a try :)
[19:37:41] <jaspertheghost_> is there a native way to impliment long click for touch screen devices in jquery?
[19:39:44] <ablegreen> Stupid question, is it possible to send an AJAX request to itself (the page containing that code to send the request)?
[19:40:16] <jaspertheghost_> yea
[19:40:28] <ablegreen> url: '/' right?
[19:40:34] <ablegreen> Or something.
[19:40:36] <systemfault> ablegreen: location.href
[19:40:44] <ablegreen> Ah, thanks.
[19:41:34] <ablegreen> Okay I'm having trouble solving this problem.
[19:41:55] <ablegreen> Let's say we have webpage and a stream of bytes is coming to it in chunks.
[19:42:22] <ablegreen> I want the page to download all the chunks as they come in into ONE file
[19:43:11] <ablegreen> So like in Chrome it'll show that download process in the download manager of that one file
[19:44:32] <ablegreen> My original idea is, as the chunks are coming in, assemble the chunks in memory then do createObjectUrl on the resulting blob. The problem with this is that assembling the chunks in memory means depending on the size of the file being transferred, you could run out of memory.
[19:45:29] <ablegreen> I'm trying to get Chrome to recognize the individual chunks as they are coming one by one as ONE file
[20:32:00] <jaspertheghost> whats a better way to impliment this-> http://jsfiddle.net/PvHn2/1/
[20:35:05] <jaspertheghost> http://jsfiddle.net/PvHn2/2/ update sorry
[20:42:17] <sammych1> so...jQuery mobile swipeleft/right events...
[20:42:30] <sammych1> they don't work in W8, or iOS, do they?
[20:42:36] <sammych1> especially W8
[22:12:03] <Puck6633> I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas about how to improve this: http://jsfiddle.net/6buZa/1/
[22:12:13] <Puck6633> It's basically a test of this plugin for jQuery: https://github.com/finalclap/iframeTracker-jquery/blob/master/jquery.iframetracker.js
[22:12:49] <Puck6633> The trouble is it doesn't detect multiple clicks within the iframe. In order to detect a second click the user has to move their mouse out of the iframe so the plugin can grab focus.
[22:13:43] <Puck6633> Am I just hoping for the impossible here? This problem has been driving me nuts for days when all I want is to know when an iframe is clicked. :(
[22:14:27] <Puck6633> I've tried various ways of stealing focus back from the iframe, but they seem to just be ignored in modern browsers.
[22:15:57] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13439303/detect-click-event-inside-iframe
[22:20:33] <Puck6633> mdev: That doesn't work cross domain, does it? How would I apply that to a YouTube embed?
[22:38:55] <wa5ted> hi jquery im back :)
