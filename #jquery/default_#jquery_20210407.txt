[00:19:46] <Absolum> simple question: how can I easily determine the width and height of a jquery object if the css has defined a scale? Do I have to check the css everytime I want to verify the height and width using $(el).height()...
[00:22:40] <robertmaxrees> Absolum that gets a little funky since the height isn't reflected in the DOM accurately when it comes to transforms.  you may need to $(foo).get(0).getBoundingClientRect() to get access to the proper dimensions.
[00:23:37] <Absolum> Thank you. That's what I thought. My new dims function is actually useful after all. Thanks.
[00:27:15] <Absolum> This one is weirder and you may suggest that I ask in js. But how do you deal with allowing synonyms in parameters. For example, I would like to be able to accept "w,h,width, height, innerwidth, iw, outerwidth, ow, etc. etc." is there an easier way that just a big if statement?
[00:27:40] <Absolum> *than sorry
[00:27:51] <robertmaxrees> is there a way?  sure.  should you?  no.
[00:28:48] <Absolum> ok, i'll bite. Why shouldn't you?
[00:29:16] <robertmaxrees> you're solving a problem you won't have in a way that'll make your code more complex with no real benefit.
[00:29:58] <robertmaxrees> stick with full words like width, height, innerWidth, outerWidth, etc.  shortening things to one or two letters is rarely beneficial - you have autocomplete for a reason :)
[00:30:50] <Absolum> Only because you have never let me down before, I will concede and do it your way. THanks for the advice. I appreciate it.
[00:32:33] <robertmaxrees> definitely :)  i've actually fallen down that hole before and realized i'd reject any code in a pr that used one-letter var/prop names.  plus, if you're designing an API, what better way to make it easier to use than to require folks use actual words :)
[00:33:28] <Absolum> Would you accept borderWidth and boxWidth as possible variants of width depending on box or border model?
[00:34:35] <robertmaxrees> honestly?  no.  it's the width.  otherwise you wind up with folks supplying both without really knowing why.
[00:36:26] <robertmaxrees> and then getting confused because one mysteriously overrides the other but only in particular circumstances haha.
[00:36:52] <Absolum> I plan to extend the rectangle provided by getBoundingClientWidth to inclue a couple of properties that I use often (like centerx and centery) otherwise, I have to recalculate those every time. Is this also a bad idea?
[00:37:22] <robertmaxrees> without knowing what you're building, why, and who the target audience is, it's hard to say tbh.
[00:38:39] <robertmaxrees> but when your plugin gets that in depth, at a certain point you have to ask "am i just writing a wrapper for (x)?".  if the answer is "yes", then the question becomes "why?"
[00:40:41] <Absolum> I am working on a demo for a watch interface. I just baught the Wyze 20$ watch and the custom OS has a lot of problems. What do you expect for 20$? But I suggested a bunch of changes and they asked if I could mock it up to look at it.
[00:41:21] <robertmaxrees> so what's with the detour into designing an API for a jquery plugin?  why not just do the mockup?
[00:42:25] <Absolum> I started using jquery for my model and .width() and .height() return the original non-scaled width and height. Which made everything else fail.
[00:42:58] <robertmaxrees> sure, though you were asking about how to accept multiple names for the same options :)
[00:43:07] <robertmaxrees> was that more just for general knowledge?
[00:43:18] <Absolum> So rather than redo all that I had done (which I was just starting to enter the code after writing it out) I figured maybe there was a better way that I could replace .width() and .height() to custom functions that would solve the scale problem.
[00:43:58] <Absolum> Which of course, led me back to my .dims() function that lets you pass parameters you want as an option
[00:44:01] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, so like a .myNewWidth() function?
[00:44:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm super confused - is your "dims" method something you built previous?
[00:44:29] <Absolum> Right, but .dims("scaledwidth, scaledheight") would give you the dims scaled
[00:44:30] <robertmaxrees> *previously?  or for this project?
[00:44:45] <Absolum> Previously when working on aligning objects
[00:45:09] <robertmaxrees> ah, and the alignment project was for something else?
[00:45:33] <Absolum> THAT was for general knowledge and because there isn't a lot of good alignment libraries
[00:46:27] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  makes sense.  just making sure you're not falling into the "changing a lightbulb" dilemma haha.
[00:47:04] <Absolum> Which if anyone has completely forgot what they were doing changing lightbulbs all year, that would be me. So I really appreciate your help.
[00:47:14] <robertmaxrees> totally!
[00:53:13] <Absolum> Ugg. even .position() and .offset() fail when something is scaled.
[00:53:38] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind jquery is a DOM abstraction library.  you're dealing with a lot of CSSOM and whatnot.
[00:54:20] <Absolum> and now I am worried about browser magnification, too. Is there a jquery alternative for CSSOM?
[00:55:14] <robertmaxrees> a lot of CSSOM isn't js accessible.
[00:55:44] <Absolum> oh great. No wonder the web is such a wreck most of the time.
[00:59:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:00:22] <Absolum> too many groups responsible for discrete aspects of web content and none of them seem to communicate.
[01:00:34] <Absolum> or rather web content presentation
[01:00:48] <robertmaxrees> erm, not really the culprit haha.
[01:02:06] <robertmaxrees> the web's a wreck because people shoehorn solutions to solve problems.  like folks using jquery for svg or w/e.
[01:02:26] <Absolum> if svg worked with jquery it would be a problem.
[01:02:49] <Absolum> so it's either people trying to deal with the svg council violating all of the css and html standards or ...
[01:02:54] <robertmaxrees> and yet, people get it to half/work all the time.
[01:03:22] <Absolum> that's my point Half/work is a wreck. Wordpress is half-work
[01:03:41] <Absolum> And try to tell me that it's not a complete clusterfunk...lol
[01:03:43] <robertmaxrees> wordpress is a problem for a whole different set of reasons.
[01:04:02] <Absolum> but it half-works
[01:04:09] <Absolum> for a lot of the web
[01:04:12] <robertmaxrees> the language it's built using wasn't any good until pretty recently and people tried to take a blogging platform into a full-blown CMS.
[01:04:56] <robertmaxrees> and even then... it's only when people try to extend it improperly or use weird plugins to make it a full ecommerce platform or whatever that it's truly an issue.
[01:05:03] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, for a lot of cases, it's fine.
[01:06:48] <Absolum> The biggest problem that I have with Wordpress is its tendency to decide for us what we should and shouldn't have access to. It makes some really peculiar and arbitrary choices for templating that defy logic.
[01:07:45] <robertmaxrees> that's what you get when you buy into that particular ecosystem.  all platforms make choices for you.
[01:08:05] <Absolum> That's why I am always changing lightbulbs. LOL
[01:08:12] <robertmaxrees> if those tradeoffs aren't working for you, then you're welcome to use a different platform.
[01:08:42] <robertmaxrees> the day my department embraced the concept of "endless migration" was the day we finally became truly and fully productive.
[01:10:40] <Absolum> Have you ever migrated in a bad direction and had to recoup?
[01:11:23] <robertmaxrees> yep!  and it was a good thing that we had those failures because we learned a TON.
[01:12:59] <robertmaxrees> our biggest failings were when we did shit like monkeypatched a framework for ourselves instead of questioning whether or not we should continue with that framework medium to long term.
[01:14:06] <Absolum> how long have you been doing this and how old are you?
[01:14:52] <robertmaxrees> been in the web game around 15 years.  turn 34 on Friday.
[01:16:50] <robertmaxrees> though age in this industry is irrelevant.  years of experience are largely the same.
[01:16:57] <Absolum> See, that's why it's easy for you. You grew up literally with computers and you were doing webdev when you were 18, probably a lot younger than that. I'm 51 and have a terrible problem with ADHD, so as fast as all of these technologies change, I feel completely unable to keep up. And since I'll never do it for a living (too old), I just try to learn as much  as I can.
[01:18:04] <Absolum> You are honestly one of the only people that I trust implicitly. Everyone has their opinion about how to do things and with css for example, I get spun into circles faster than anything.
[01:18:37] <robertmaxrees> i wasn't doing webdev when i was 18 - just been in the industry for that long :)  and i'm the same as you inasmuch as i just picked stuff up as i went.  i also know a TON of extremely succesful neurodivergent/differently abled engineers.  blind, colorblind, ADHD, spectrum, etc.
[01:20:19] <Absolum> Name one that started in this industry at 51. Right now, there is such ageism in technology. People don't want to invest in the elderly. You'll see what I mean when you get here. People aren't going to hire you and send you to learn something, if you aren't a skilled professional by 51, you won't get hired.
[01:20:46] <robertmaxrees> I actually have a coworker who made the shift into the industry at 50 :)
[01:21:53] <robertmaxrees> and any place that is demonstrating agist bullshit like that is a place you wouldn't want to work for anyway.  there are a lot of places working to do away with that kind of stuff.
[01:23:06] <Absolum> Do you know of anywhere that I could test my skills and start classes at my skill level rather than from the start?
[01:23:34] <Absolum> When I went to college, there was one degree in Computer Services. That's it. LOL
[01:24:08] <robertmaxrees> not really?  i've never once looked at certifications or anything like that.  and a degree doesn't tell me much either.
[01:26:43] <Absolum> I'm not so much worried about credentials. Anyone can take a class and pass a test. I would really like to get a better grasp on the process of developing. I start so many things and get halfway through and find out that it would have been so much better another way.
[01:26:54] <Absolum> So I restart and after about 50 iterations, I give up
[01:27:38] <robertmaxrees> sure - i had an employee recently go through a similar experience.  senior dev was treading water, trying to solve a problem for about 2 weeks.  took a few days off, came back, started over, and did it in half a day.
[01:27:56] <robertmaxrees> i do that, too.
[01:28:28] <Absolum> How do you ever complete anything?
[01:29:21] <robertmaxrees> eventually you realize a few things: that the last 20% takes the longest, perfect is the enemy of done, and sooner is better than better.
[01:29:53] <robertmaxrees> how long have you been at trying to learn?
[01:30:03] <Absolum> I need to print those statements out and put them on my monitor. I get so frustrated if its not perfect and it's never perfect
[01:30:52] <Absolum> I have been coding websites for probably 10 years. They are all a mess and lately I have been just switching everything over to WordPress where I can pass blame.
[01:31:09] <Absolum> Not proud about it, but it gets the job done.
[01:31:49] <Absolum> And just for friends and very few clients. Nothign critical
[01:33:11] <robertmaxrees> define "mess" in this case.
[01:33:15] <Absolum> Most of my work that looked good and I was proud of was in Flash. Since flash died a long while ago, I have been learning the rest and could probably do a lot more if I knew where to start.
[01:33:33] <Absolum> Things like not designed for mobile.
[01:33:53] <robertmaxrees> aaah.  so understanding things like mobile-first designs.
[01:33:53] <Absolum> JS code is really out of date and works buggy. CSS is always a problem for me.
[01:34:44] <robertmaxrees> most frontend engineers don't really know css fwiw.  s'why a lot of places use bootstrap or tachyons or something similar.
[01:35:35] <Absolum> I need to break down and accept that fact. I never want to use these pre-built systems because I figure if I can't do it myself, what good is it to use a prebuilt system?
[01:36:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaah - invert that logic: a lot of people already solved that problem, so quit wasting your time :)
[01:36:54] <robertmaxrees> plus you'll learn a ton through interacting with tools like those.  not just about css and whatnot but about things like project structure and modularity and the like.
[01:38:54] <Absolum> My problem is that it all looks alike all the time. Sometimes that's okay, but gawd if anyone asks me to use those silhouetted vector people standing around doing something stupid with bold title text as a landing page, I'm out.
[01:39:02] <Absolum> It's like typesetting with Comic Sans
[01:39:52] <robertmaxrees> Old, uncustomized Bootstrap, sure.  Easy enough to modify yourself.  and Tachyons avoids that problem entirely.
[01:40:12] <Absolum> Ill check out Tachyons. Never heard of them before.
[01:40:25] <robertmaxrees> tachyons.io
[01:40:37] <robertmaxrees> there are a ton of other similar tools out there.
[08:00:06] <Robdgreat> 32
[08:00:09] <Robdgreat> oops.
[08:04:06] <undefined_bob> its 42
