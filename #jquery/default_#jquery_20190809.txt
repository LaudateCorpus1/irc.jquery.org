[11:50:24] <vish93> Hey guys I keep getting syntax error for `$('"img['+_.options.lazyLoadSrcAttr+']"', _.$slider).not('[src]').addClass('slick-loading');` but cannot see the error
[11:51:03] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[11:55:22] <robertmaxrees> vish93 i ask because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gs3owjzL/
[11:55:26] <robertmaxrees> not seeing the error here.

[11:59:06] <robertmaxrees> :|
[11:59:20] <robertmaxrees> lol that's not how you include external scripts.
[12:00:43] <robertmaxrees> just remove slick from the JS panel and it's fine?
[12:01:07] <vish93> robertmaxre: slick I have added like that as it’s a pull version I am trying to fix
[12:03:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:03:34] <robertmaxrees> you've added slick twice to that codepen
[12:03:51] <robertmaxrees> you can't just paste the source a second time into your JS and expect it to work.
[12:04:13] <vish93> robertmaxrees: I tried removing the slick from resources too
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:05:18] <vish93> https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/pen/xvaaJd
[12:05:24] <robertmaxrees> are you using slick or owl?
[12:07:00] <vish93> Slick
[12:07:09] <vish93> I have made changes in my pull
[12:07:09] <robertmaxrees> then why are you also including owl in that codepen?
[12:07:16] <robertmaxrees> you mean changes to click carousel?
[12:07:19] <robertmaxrees> *slick
[12:08:22] <vish93> robertmaxrees: owl would have been left from when I forked from my original owl pen
[12:08:30] <robertmaxrees> then remove it.
[12:08:56] <vish93> robertmaxrees: Yeah made changes to slick, i have removed the css. Should only be the jquery and my custom slick code
[12:08:58] <vish93> https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/pen/xvaaJd
[12:09:02] <robertmaxrees> as far as slick - where's the PR?
[12:09:08] <robertmaxrees> so i can see what you changed.
[12:11:55] <vish93> https://github.com/vishy93/slick/commit/1ea30b0232c998d24c2a1e56eae0cc1850e9cc1b
[12:12:26] <robertmaxrees> why did you change line 538???
[12:13:07] <robertmaxrees> lines 538, 1550, and 1769 - revert those.
[12:13:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not even how you want to wrap those quotes.
[12:13:45] <vish93> robertmaxrees: they were set as data-lazy
[12:14:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:14:39] <robertmaxrees> that commit just tries to add some extra quotes, which it doesn't need, and changes quotes where it shouldn't.
[12:15:13] <vish93> robertmaxrees: Sorry the commit link I sent is from me playing around with it
[12:15:14] <robertmaxrees> remove all the extra double quotes you added and it'll be fine.
[12:15:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't need them.
[12:18:06] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[12:18:24] <vish93> I will do now
[12:24:32] <vish93> done https://github.com/vishy93/slick/commit/3f42cf99c7976ee6087f8a67bb8cdbf5d6128559
[15:49:03] <ckb> I must have a brainfart here… If I’m not using $() I just use jQuery() right?
[15:49:16] <taplar> you can
[15:49:33] <taplar> if I'm understanding your question
[15:49:45] <ckb> I’m trying to use custom javascript on wordpress and it’s telling my jQuery is not defined :<
[15:49:59] <ckb> s/my/me
[15:49:59] <taplar> sure, lost of wordpress run in noConflict mode
[15:50:04] <taplar> *lots
[15:50:14] * ckb really? even jQuery won’t work?
[15:50:26] <taplar> no, noConflict just means '$' isn't jQuery
[15:50:43] <ckb> yes, I’m using jQuery
[15:50:46] <ckb> not $
[15:51:04] <ckb> hmph ok this isn’t a jQuery issue. I’ll go to WP
[15:51:06] <ckb> thanks!
[15:51:07] <taplar> jQuery(function($){ ...I can now use $... });
[15:51:18] <ckb> that’s what I have...
[15:51:46] <ckb> this really isn’t jQ issue
[15:51:49] <ckb> mind if I DM?
[15:51:59] <ckb> or should I go to #WP?
[15:52:11] <taplar> definitely a wp room.
[15:52:17] <ckb> thanks
[15:54:04] <ckb> It’s definitely not a jQ issue :)
[15:57:43] <ckb> I’m a dummy. :> Thanks taplar.
[15:58:37] <taplar> ?
[15:59:55] <ckb> I just said thank you!
[16:00:13] <taplar> ah, cool.  i thought maybe you figured out your issue
[16:03:40] * ckb I did :) Can I bind .change on hidden inputs?
[16:04:00] <taplar> sure.  seems slightly odd, but sure
[16:04:15] <ckb> working with a wp theme here…
[16:04:38] <taplar> right, but a hidden input typically would not get any events.  unless they were programatically triggered
[16:05:38] <ckb> that’s what this theme does… it’s a customized dropdown
[16:05:39] <grapheti> TRIGGERED
[16:05:55] <taplar> ok, so yeah, go for it
[16:06:40] <ckb> grapheti: plz don’t :(
[16:06:54] <grapheti> I get triggered at all my events.
[16:07:02] <ckb> LOL
[16:09:30] * ckb .change will trigger on jQuery .val() right?
[16:09:35] <taplar> no
[16:09:39] <ckb> oof
[16:09:51] <ckb> .val(‘’) I mean..
[16:09:54] <taplar> no
[16:10:04] <taplar> events, by default, only trigger from user actions
[16:10:15] <ckb> not from scripts, ok..
[16:10:38] <ckb> unless they trigger it manually.
[16:10:38] <taplar> that's excluding the non-user events like 'load' and the like, of course
[16:10:42] <taplar> correct
[16:10:43] <ckb> any options for me here?
[16:10:56] <taplar> regarding?
[16:11:16] <grapheti> triggers when user changes select dawg
[16:11:45] <ckb> Well if a theme has an HTML dropdown with a hidden input for the value, what’s the best way for me to simulate a “.change”?
[16:12:13] <ckb> what’s the point in .change on a hidden input at this point (previous conversation)
[16:12:34] <taplar> best approach would be if you could manage the theme plugin to attach on change logic to it directly
[16:12:47] <ckb> but if the theme gets updated?
[16:12:47] <taplar> otherwise, if you do not have a way to do that, you could protentially override the `val()` metohd
[16:12:55] <ckb> I might just want to bind the click, yeah?
[16:13:20] <ckb> who’s to say my bind won’t trigger before the input is updated though?
[16:13:53] <taplar> i'm not sure i follow
[16:14:07] <ckb> It’s a div with a ul that’s positioned relatively.
[16:14:16] <ckb> I’m sure they have a click bind on the ul
[16:14:24] <ckb> to change the value of the hidden input
[16:14:42] <ckb> if I bind another click on that ul, will theirs fire first?
[16:15:06] <taplar> iirc the order is the order they are bound.  so if you bind last, yours should happen last
[16:15:16] <ckb> brb
[16:15:26] * ckb will confirm in one minute
[16:17:06] <grapheti> dat single-threaded lang
[16:17:24] <ckb> ?
[16:18:45] <grapheti> taplar is right, it's the order they are bound
[16:19:31] <ckb> Confirmed
[16:19:38] <grapheti> :D
[16:21:31] <grapheti> why it's that way is because js is a single-threaded language (which they are making advances to make it use multiple threads)
[16:21:59] <grapheti> single-threaded meaning it process things line by line top to bottom in order
[16:22:20] <ckb> well some frameworks allow you to specify order!!
[16:22:30] <taplar> line by line is more related to being procedural
[16:22:35] <ckb> I found my solution. Thanks, fellas.
[16:23:06] <ckb> $200 project turned out to be a $600 project. That happen to any of you people?
[16:23:29] <ckb> (and only get paid the $200 unless they think you did exceptional)
[16:23:59] <grapheti> When people don't know the scope, yes.
[16:24:14] <ckb> you mean the clients?
[16:24:23] <taplar> i don't really have any freelance experience, myself
[16:24:37] <ckb> it’s hit or miss, to be honest.
[16:24:40] <grapheti> I have some. Not a lot.
[16:25:04] <grapheti> I work at a 9 - 6 job supporting a SaaS
[16:25:04] <ckb> Also do any of you use OSX? plz don’t laugh
[16:25:35] <ckb> Atom just isn’t cutting it for me and Eclipse takes SO long to setup
[16:25:46] <grapheti> I have an iPhone 5C
[16:26:26] <ckb> :<
[16:26:29] <grapheti> Other text editors exist apart from https://code.visualstudio.com/ ?
[16:27:40] <grapheti> ye I meant clients*
[16:43:31] <makr8100> kdevelop is pretty awesome for kde/linux, not sure how well it runson other oses
[16:43:38] <makr8100> I do like atom and vs code tho
[16:44:08] <makr8100> codeanywhere.com is pretty legit, sublime (I don't prefer sublime myself but I know a lot do)
[16:44:42] <makr8100> there's always notepad++ P:
[16:52:30] <ckb> Atom is giving me a lot of errors.
