[01:29:11] <Lenswipee> hi, do you need to put 'exit;' at the end of the ajax call back function? so function foo(){ do_something(); exit; }
[01:35:47] <ryan_ford> sounds like a job for promises
[01:36:02] <Lenswipee> ?
[01:36:15] <ryan_ford> sorry, misread that
[01:36:36] <ryan_ford> where did you learn that? afaik that means nothing in js or jquery
[04:05:59] <optics> could anyone help me i am stuck, I am trying to make line 143 the button .Yes autoload on page load
[04:32:22] <jomofcw> Hello !
[05:16:17] <emx> i am looking for a solution to download a file from an endpoint that requires a specific header (bearer token). how can i achieve that?
[05:17:56] <Woet> emx: send the header..?
[05:19:48] <emx> Woet, i was not specific enough: once the successful request is made, how do i make the browser display the download dialogue?
[05:20:12] <emx> (or make it download the file after successful endpoint request?)
[05:20:47] <Woet> emx: you redirect to that URL. jquery can't force a download.
[05:21:56] <Woet> emx: you could try https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3077242/force-download-a-pdf-link-using-javascript-ajax-jquery/29266135#29266135 or https://caniuse.com/#search=download
[05:24:39] <emx> Woet, those solutions don't pass the bearer token...
[05:24:56] <Woet> emx: not sure then, sounds like you should just do it server side
[05:29:40] <emx> hm... k
[10:47:24] <Sircle> Is there a fast way to include partials of page (for re usabilty) like the head/fooder etc via javascript without using and library like react or angular or even without jquery?
[10:48:03] <taplar> you mean like via ajax?
[10:49:32] <Sircle> any way
[10:50:05] <taplar> i mean, sure, you could grab the elements with ajax and put them on the page.  or you could have javascript build them from scratch, which is ugly, but could be done
[10:58:11] <Sircle>  I just did <script type="text/javascript" src="head / footer "> and it does not even loads the page  taplar
[10:59:22] <taplar> all that is going to do is try to load a file.  to make javascript do either of those things, you have to write some js to fetch the data and put it on the page, or include the script that builds the markup and puts it on the page.
[10:59:44] <taplar> which for questions about doing either of those would be on topic for ##javascript
[14:51:09] <Rob_Jones> can someone help me build my jsonp ajax request, trying to just print the json but starting like this
[14:51:10] <Rob_Jones> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/BPEeQV
[14:51:26] <Rob_Jones> not sure what is required in the ajax() function
[14:51:45] <taplar> first off, are you sure the endpoint supports jsonp?
[14:52:17] <Rob_Jones> pretty sure as i got it off documentation
[14:52:26] <Rob_Jones> if not it will just error though right?
[14:52:31] <taplar> can you share the documentation?
[14:52:41] <Rob_Jones> well its from a wikia but sure
[14:53:17] <Rob_Jones> http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Application_programming_interface#playerDetails
[14:54:52] <Rob_Jones> basically a js callback only shows limited parameters, but if I call it using an ajax request I can get more data which will be more useful, from reading based on what I have done to what I am trying to achieve, I just need to check if its the query is a success and if so do a .html() function
[14:54:59] <Rob_Jones> if i am reading the function right
[14:58:41] <taplar> I'm getting a 404 from that endpoint for some reason
[14:59:40] <Rob_Jones> hmm I wonder if the url has been disabled
[14:59:54] <Rob_Jones> I know http://services.runescape.com/m=website-data/playerDetails.ws?names=%5B%22The%20Aviansie%22%5D&callback=jQuery000000000000000_0000000000&_=0
[14:59:57] <Rob_Jones> worksk
[14:59:59] <Rob_Jones> works*
[15:02:34] <taplar> aah, ok
[15:02:43] <taplar> so you may not be able to use the jsonp option
[15:02:53] <taplar> you may have to build the url with the callback yourself
[15:03:38] <taplar> i put the callback in the url explicitly and it changed from a 404 to a CORS error, but that's just because i'm testing it on jsfiddle which is on https and that site is on http
[15:04:02] <Rob_Jones> basically I am trying to get the online status
[15:04:20] <Rob_Jones> thats my only use for it :/ but I am guessing they may have changed their api to disable that data
[15:04:53] <taplar> so give what I just suggested a try and see if it works
[15:06:59] <Rob_Jones> getting a 404 error with CORS too
[15:07:10] <Rob_Jones> gunna just put this down to the url is no longer active
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[16:40:53] <sootcode> trying to load file like  $.ajax({ url: path, dataType: "text", success: function(data) { console.log(data); } });  path is correct; I get 404 not found
[16:41:14] <sootcode> path is correct (I have checked many times): https://i.imgur.com/ESI1haj.png
[16:41:25] <sootcode> do I need to load a different way?
[16:41:47] <taplar> if you take that url and stick it in your browser, does it return a 404?
[16:41:51] <robertmaxrees> try hitting that URL in ...
[16:41:55] <robertmaxrees> ^^ what taplar saoid
[16:42:20] <sootcode> yes still 404 unfortunately, but file is there in file system
[16:42:34] <taplar> then your server is not configurated as you expect it should be
[16:42:41] <taplar> or you are looking in the wrong url
[16:42:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:42:57] <robertmaxrees> just because the filepath says one thing doesn't mean the server respects that.
[16:43:01] <sootcode> yes that is it. "The page you are requesting cannot be served because of the extension configuration" I didn't see that
[16:43:21] <sootcode> um. That is really lame. Not my server.
[16:43:27] <sootcode> thanks
[16:57:37] <sootcode> why don't  always: myFunc  and  fail: myFunc  work inside of the $.ajax({ .. })   @_@
[16:57:50] <sootcode> I can only get success: to work
[16:58:11] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[16:59:54] <sootcode> 1.10.2
[17:00:07] <robertmaxrees> to more directly answer your question: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[17:00:22] <robertmaxrees> "always" and "fail" aren't properties for that config object.
[17:00:25] <sootcode> if I do outside it works but I find strange to allow success attribute without the others
[17:00:40] <robertmaxrees> fail should be error.
[17:00:45] <robertmaxrees> always should be complete.
[17:00:46] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:01:30] <Gh0st_Preacher> okay back
[17:01:45] <robertmaxrees> weee
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, there are no "always" or "fail" options for $.ajax
[17:02:07] <sootcode> yes that's how I got to work. .fail() on the ajax obj
[17:02:13] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[17:02:24] <robertmaxrees> i mean, preferably you'd use .then() and .catchI()
[17:02:27] <robertmaxrees> *.catch()
[17:02:47] <robertmaxrees> and not success: etc.
[17:03:37] <sootcode> why you do dis to me. .success and .fail work and seem proper
[17:04:42] <robertmaxrees> promises :)
[17:04:57] <sootcode> I no use promises because ie and no polyfill because im stupid
[17:05:04] <sootcode> ie == internet explorer
[17:05:19] <robertmaxrees> except jquery still supports them.
[17:05:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can still use .then() on $.ajax()
[17:06:00] <sootcode> oh I thought maybe you were referring to some promises that I would need to keep--I was going to say that I am bad at keeping promises ;p
[17:06:10] <sootcode> s/keep/make in js/
[17:06:44] <sootcode> I mean besides perhaps usually being a promise unless polyfilled, what is the difference
[17:09:15] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[17:09:17] <robertmaxrees> .then()
[17:09:57] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().then()
[17:14:13] <sootcode> what is the difference (referring to .success); also StackOverflow: "Prior to jQuery 1.8, then() was just syntactic sugar"
[17:14:47] <sootcode> and I don't want to use promises; .then is an alias for .pipe which returns a promise
[17:15:47] <sootcode> oh I forgot I am on 1.10
[17:16:54] <sootcode> I don't know what is going on or what I am talking about; tired, but seems to work in ie anyway I guess because jquery hanbdles that
[17:17:36] <taplar> uh, you're doing ajax.  you're going to be using some form of a deferred any way you slice it
[17:24:16] <sootcode> ok thanks I don't normally work with jquery, but you've been a tremendous help. Leaving soon but many thanks o/
[17:24:57] * sootcode eyes suspiciously *  I am using .then()  ()_()
[17:25:26] <taplar> ?
[17:26:24] <sootcode> because you told me to, but I am still wary ()_()
[17:26:59] <taplar> I think you're confusing me with robert?  What are you wary of?
[17:27:15] <sootcode> everything and everyone all the time
[17:27:28] <taplar> ah, ok
[17:28:34] <sootcode> just kidding, but nearly every time someone has told me "you should always use this" there has been more to the story, and to top it off, there is usually a 50% accuracy
[17:29:33] <taplar> i mean, you don't *have* to use then(), but it is an option
[17:29:58] <sootcode> I am warily using it for now until I read more about it tomorrow morning
[17:30:02] <taplar> it is the preferred way if you are doing A++ promise logic though I believe
[17:31:34] <taplar> r/A++/A+/
[17:33:12] <sootcode> An A++ is a B
[17:33:18] <sootcode> you're trying to trick me!
[17:33:39] <sootcode> thanks chao migos
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> it's the way you should really be doing any callbacks if you don't haev async/await tbh
[17:34:19] <sootcode> I am waiting for it and then calling a callback anyway @_@ haha
[17:34:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:34:43] <sootcode> gotta parse the config before you do anything @_)@
[17:34:59] <robertmaxrees> that should be a synchronous call.
[17:36:22] <sootcode> I think you're correct
[17:36:33] <robertmaxrees> i generally am, yes ;)
[17:36:48] <sootcode> don't have time to test; maybe I will get my geese in a row after reading up and see what I am doing tomorrow; have to go thanks a bunch
[18:17:03] <devish> I am trying my luck with this plugin https://www.jqueryscript.net/form/Dynamic-Autocomplete-Tag-Input-Plugin-For-jQuery-Tokenize2.html
[18:17:39] <devish> but it takes source as remote.php. https://pastebin.com/dm5zBs1U Is there a way to
[18:17:50] <devish> get this done using jquery
[18:18:33] <devish> this is sorting based on user's entry without it matching based on entry is broken
[19:36:46] <sine0> folks, I want to have a form with lists and dropdowns that use related data. so far I have been using this style but I get the feeling that its wrong. is there a better way?
[19:36:49] <sine0> http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/612753/
[19:37:05] <sine0> when I change the first drop down, the other drop downs should update their options
[19:47:22] <sine0> can you target and effect more than one id
[19:47:51] <sine0> $('#id1 #id2 #id3').empty()
[19:54:31] <pavonia> Separate them with commas, I think
[19:57:59] <kevr> hmm
[19:58:17] <kevr> $.ajax gets a 200 response from the remote side, but the error callback is called instead of success
[19:58:22] <kevr> that sounds abnormal, right?
[19:59:32] <shoky> kevr: that's usually caused by one of 2 reasons:  either a cross-domain request was blocked by the browser,  or the response has content-type that doesn't match its content (e.g. bad json)
[19:59:43] <kevr> that must be it
[20:00:01] <kevr> the latter, that is
[20:00:01] <shoky> error callback arguments should tell you if its a parse error
[20:00:03] <kevr> sec
[20:00:15] <shoky> if they are blank/unhelpful then its probably the former
[20:00:38] <shoky> (2nd or 3rd arguments iirc)
[20:01:07] <kevr> thanks bud, let me check a bit deeper into the error
[20:02:06] <kevr> shoky: aha, yep, i used the wrong dataType option
[20:02:33] <shoky> aye
[20:02:42] <kevr> awesome. thanks bud
[20:02:46] <shoky> np
