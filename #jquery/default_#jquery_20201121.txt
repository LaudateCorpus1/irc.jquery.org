[04:11:16] <adasr3> hey guys, I want to disable submit button on form submit and change the text on the button and trigger form submit. I try https://www.script1.net/125 both form and form[0]  but submit is doing nothing. No error in console, and when logging the form, it looks correct
[04:11:31] <adasr3> what do you guys think is the issue
[04:11:43] <adasr3> that I can not submit the form with jquery
[07:31:21] <onizu> hi. I have a form having <select> which is getting submitted onchange of the <select> option. However I don't want the form to submit for one particular option. How can I achieve this? I have the  onchange attribute in the select tag like this:  onchange="this.form.submit()"
[12:34:03] <Destramic> guys why isnt my replace working please? https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/xhn5mpge/
[12:35:09] <shoky> Destramic:  .replace() doesn't mutate the string, it just returns a new one
[12:38:55] <Destramic> shoky thank you, sorted now :)
[13:16:24] <Destramic> https://pastebin.com/Hv85fdQP     why am i not getting my result in the response please when using the fetch api?
[13:22:38] <shoky> Destramic: seems like you get a response.. you didn't really show any relevant code. what does this have to do with jquery anyway
[13:34:47] <Destramic> shoky: true, anyhows i fixed it adding this line https://pastebin.com/04XTq506
