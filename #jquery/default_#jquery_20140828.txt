[00:32:29] <workerbeetwo> Hi. How to make sure an action is finished before executing the next statement?
[00:32:47] <Cork> uh
[00:32:57] <Cork> by "action" you man ajax?
[00:33:21] <workerbeetwo> could be.
[00:34:10] <Cork> could??
[00:34:50] <Cork> if the command isn't async you don't need to care cause it will always finish before the next one is called
[00:35:01] <Cork> so in normal code that is always true
[00:35:18] <Cork> you need to be a bit more specific if you want an answer
[00:35:46] <st6> workerbeetwo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709597/wait-until-all-jquery-ajax-requests-are-done/9865124#9865124
[00:35:50] <workerbeetwo> sure. the ajax call is wrapped into another function. so that whole function  needs to have finished.
[00:36:04] <Cork> workerbeetwo: ok, you can't do it in that form
[00:36:14] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you need to either use the success callbacks for ajax
[00:36:24] <Cork> or use the deferred object ajax returns
[00:36:31] <Cork> collect them and send them to $.when
[00:36:43] <Cork> (the last one is definitely the simplest way)
[00:44:33] * FanyyB ** SysInfo ** Client: HexChat 2.10.1 (x64) ** OS: Microsoft Windows 8.1 ** CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3537U CPU @ 2.00GHz (1.00 GHz) ** RAM: 8058 MB Total (3114 MB Free) ** VGA: AMD Radeon HD 7500M/7600M Series ** Uptime: 163.80 Hours **
[00:48:01] <workerbeetwo> I have:  $.when( loadPage( nextPageLink ) );
[00:48:10] <workerbeetwo> but it does nto seem to work.
[00:49:09] <Cork> workerbeetwo: and loadPage does return $.ajax(); ?
[00:49:31] <workerbeetwo> Cork: yes
[00:49:38] <Cork> workerbeetwo: make a fuddle
[00:49:40] <Cork> *fiddle
[00:54:59] <workerbeetwo> let me check something first. is there a wait function ?
[00:57:19] <workerbeetwo> like loadPage() ; wait(2000) ; dosomething();  ?
[00:57:29] <dismist> delay
[00:57:35] <Cork> no don't
[00:59:39] <workerbeetwo> delay is undefined anaways. :)
[01:05:36] <Berserkk> Trying to change the animation on some navigation bar tabs and change content depending on what tab is clicked: http://jsfiddle.net/8qz78pkc/
[01:07:05] <Berserkk> There are two seciont where the first one is hidden from the beginning. Clicking "vänner" tab should hide Tidslinje and show vänner and vice versa.
[01:08:37] <Berserkk> Clicking "vänner" hides "tidlinje" but does not show anything and you can't hide vänner by clicking back on "tidslinje"
[01:11:54] <lilsammy> Anyone know of a "buisness hours" type plugin?
[01:12:40] <lilsammy> Found this: http://gendelf.github.io/jquery.businessHours/ but it doesn't allow for multiple open / close periods in a day
[01:12:44] <lilsammy> like stopping for lunch
[01:16:08] <workerbeetwo> so is there an independent wait function?
[01:18:42] <Cork> no
[01:53:43] <Cork> workerbeetwo: so got busy a bit
[01:53:53] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you can't wait in js as js is single threaded
[01:54:14] <Cork> what you instead have to do is add callbacks that the other end calls when they are done doing something
[02:17:06] <Rudeboy> How can I figure out why my JSON function is not working in <IE8
[02:20:48] <mention> hi guys , im using mention.js plugin , the problem in the blug in its start searching i pau one character and it does not have option if i want to start search after how many character , and when i start typing it hand till i get the result  ..see the example here http://www.jay-kapadia.com/mention/demo.html
[03:01:19] <Rudeboy> Please can someone tell me why this doesn't work in IE8? http://paste.ofcode.org/AHjKbwMkQUVUuEqHntenn2
[03:01:43] <Rudeboy> Anyone who is familiar with JSON
[03:07:37] <sacho_> formatting, dude.
[03:07:53] <sacho_> also, what does "doesn't work" mean?
[03:08:09] <timgauthier> define failure
[03:10:23] <Cork> Rudeboy: i don't see anything obviously wrong with it
[03:10:48] <Cork> though  jQuery(document).ready(function() {    (function ($) { })(jQuery); }); can be simplified to  jQuery(document).ready(function($) { });
[03:10:57] <Cork> (same exact thing)
[03:11:57] <Cork> though you have php in there
[03:12:08] <mention> guys , in thos plug in http://www.jay-kapadia.com/mention/demo.html , how to make typing no hang during search ?
[03:12:08] <Cork> get the generated code you actually run and have a second look
[03:13:01] <Rudeboy> sacho_: I have two dropdowns - the second dropdown populates based on the selection of the first. On IE, the second dropdown shows the "loading" text, then just brings up a blank dropdown
[03:14:21] <Rudeboy> Cork: Thanks:) I've changed it now
[03:14:39] <mention> guys ?
[03:15:02] <Rudeboy> Cork: Although now it doesn't work on any browser ha ha, oh glory
[03:15:20] <Cork> Rudeboy: did you remove the })(jQuery); part too?
[03:15:21] <shilon> anyone knows how can i make a <video> start playing after fully loaded?
[03:15:58] <Rudeboy> Cork: Oh wait...sorry, it's working now:)
[03:16:11] <Rudeboy> But flip, I can't work out why the heck it won't work on stupid IE
[03:16:27] <Cork> Rudeboy: meaning this http://jsfiddle.net/0sxkdrLy/ should be this http://jsfiddle.net/0sxkdrLy/1/
[03:16:44] <Cork> Rudeboy: any error messages in ie?
[03:17:31] <Rudeboy> Cork: Let me just try it in IE9 quick. IE7's debugging really sucks
[03:17:38] <Cork> ya
[03:18:16] <Cork> would not surprise me if it works there though
[03:21:29] <shilon> anyone knows how can i make a <video> start playing after fully loaded?
[03:21:49] <Cork> shilon: set the autoplay attribute?
[03:22:16] <shilon> Cork: but that only starts playing and if the video is too big it will always stop for buffer
[03:23:12] <shilon> Cork: i need to loaded it in order to start playing and dont stop for buffering
[03:23:42] <Cork> shilon: well you can listen for the canplaythrough event on the element
[03:23:51] <Rudeboy> Cork: There aren't any errors in the console :/
[03:23:58] <Cork> Rudeboy: ouch...
[03:24:13] <Cork> Rudeboy: is the $.post triggering a network access to the server?
[03:24:57] <Rudeboy> Cork: How do I find that out? I'm not very familiar with JSON, that bit of code was written by someone else
[03:25:12] <Cork> Rudeboy: you would have to look at the server logs
[03:25:20] <Cork> it pre 10s developer tools sucks
[03:25:36] <Rudeboy> Cork: Can I check with Firebug?
[03:25:46] <Cork> Rudeboy: you mean firebug light?
[03:25:57] <Rudeboy> Cork: No, in Firefox
[03:26:05] <Cork> didn't it work as it should in none ie?
[03:28:08] <Rudeboy> Cork: To check the server logs. But yes, I understand I wouldn't use Firebug for that ha ha
[03:28:21] <Cork> ya
[03:28:26] <Cork> that is just client side
[03:28:26] <Rudeboy> Cork: Must I check  the apache2 logs?
[03:28:41] <Rudeboy> Cork: Localhost on linux
[03:28:47] <Cork> Rudeboy: that is the best suggestion i can give you for for old ies
[03:29:05] <airdem> i want to sort li elements by data attribute. how should i do this?
[03:29:22] <Cork> airdem: what data attribute
[03:29:31] <Cork> (makes it simpler to give you an example)
[03:29:35] <airdem> suuuuyi, is a bot spamming links via pm
[03:29:43] <airdem> data-ip
[03:29:47] <Cork> ops ^
[03:29:56] <airdem> <li data-ip="2347239587">item</li>
[03:30:18] <Rudeboy> Cork: To check the apache2 logs?
[03:32:39] <Cork> airdem: http://jsfiddle.net/wk0gjmxr/
[03:33:02] <Cork> Rudeboy: on linux default loggin for apache would be /var/log/apache2/
[03:34:34] <Rudeboy> Cork: Would it be safe to delete those and have them regenerate to make reading them easier?
[03:35:00] <Cork> Rudeboy: tail -f /var/log/apache2/<file to monitor>.log
[03:35:07] <Cork> no need to remove them :)
[03:35:27] <mention> guys , can u help me please?
[03:35:53] <Rudeboy> Cork: That's definitely going in my Linx tips folder :)
[03:35:56] <Cork> mention: you need to ask the question
[03:36:22] <mention> cokr , look to this plugin http://www.jay-kapadia.com/mention/demo.html , when i start type , its hang
[03:36:31] <airdem> i dont know if the ops understood me right but again: suuuuyi is a bot spamming links via pm
[03:36:39] <mention> i try to fix is from the source , but i could not
[03:36:47] <Rudeboy> Cork: Should I be looking at the access or error logs?
[03:37:12] <Cork> mention: sorry i don't have the time to dissect a 200 line plugin
[03:37:24] <Cork> Rudeboy: well both
[03:37:30] <Cork> but start with access
[03:37:37] <Rudeboy> airdem: me too
[03:37:40] <Cork> as that is where it should end up if everything works
[03:37:48] <Rudeboy> Cork: Ok cool:)
[03:38:05] <Cork> Rudeboy: if the server gets code errors that ends up in the error log
[03:38:23] <Cork> airdem: might not be any around, so try mentioning it in #freenode
[03:39:27] <mention> ok Cork , thank u
[03:39:27] <airdem> done
[03:39:56] <Rudeboy> Cork: Nothing in error log. In access, I get this:
[03:40:11] <Cork> you don't need to paste it
[03:40:16] <Rudeboy> 10.0.0.5 - - [28/Aug/2014:12:39:10 +0200] "POST /site/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1105 "http://10.0.0.5/site/" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)"
[03:40:28] <Rudeboy> Cork: Sorry, saw your message now
[03:40:33] <Cork> just verify that the server actually answeres
[03:40:50] <Rudeboy> Cork: How do I do that?
[03:41:01] <Cork> after that add an alert (as console.log doesn't work in old ie) in the success response
[03:41:06] <Cork> at the top of the function
[03:41:11] <Cork> to see if you get there
[03:41:17] <Cork> Rudeboy: you just did
[03:41:55] <Rudeboy> Cork: I just did what?
[03:42:09] <Cork> <Rudeboy> Cork: How do I do that? <-- the log entry you pasted is the verification
[03:42:22] <Cork> HTTP/1.1" 200 <--
[03:42:50] <airdem> Cork, than you for the fiddle but the second if can be left out, no?
[03:42:55] <Rudeboy> Cork: Oh. So it should technically be working then?
[03:43:01] <Cork> airdem: no
[03:43:17] <Cork> airdem: .sort wants -1 1 and 0 as response
[03:43:23] <Cork> -1 a smaller then b
[03:43:29] <Cork> 1 b is smaller then a
[03:43:34] <Cork> 0 a is the same as b
[03:47:42] <Rudeboy> Cork: I put an alert after the success response and it fired
[03:49:01] <Cork> Rudeboy: and if you put the html into the alert it shows the correct content?
[03:49:24] <airdem> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/wk0gjmxr/1/ its not sorting somehow did i get anything wrong?
[03:50:00] <airdem> line 8 append the new li to the ul and line 20 should then sort the lis in ul
[03:50:13] <Cork> airdem: you sort the elements and then.. nothing
[03:50:23] <Cork> you removed the parent.append() code i had
[03:50:31] <Cork> so you never modify the order in the dom
[03:50:58] <Cork> you just sort an array, and then throw the array away
[03:51:11] <airdem> im so cruel. lol
[03:51:24] <airdem> ok ill try again
[03:51:36] <Rudeboy> Cork: Like this? alert(response.html);
[03:51:48] <Cork> airdem: also to make things a little more robust you should use .children('li') not .find
[03:52:04] <airdem> now it works
[03:52:07] <Cork> airdem: cause else you will move nested lis into the $dest
[03:52:14] <Cork> Rudeboy: yes
[03:52:32] <Rudeboy> Cork: that seems to freeze my page
[03:52:41] <Cork> Rudeboy: huh...
[03:52:47] <Cork> oook
[03:53:01] <airdem> i thought $dest.append($dest.children('li') .... ); would double the lis somehow
[03:53:10] <Cork> Rudeboy: alert('length: ' + response.html.length);
[03:53:16] <airdem> cause $dest has LIs and then i append them all again
[03:53:26] <Cork> airdem: elements is objects
[03:53:29] <Rudeboy> Cork: Ok, it's showing results in IE
[03:53:36] <Rudeboy> Cork: In the alert box
[03:53:37] <Cork> adding them to a new position moves them, not copies
[03:53:45] <airdem> neat!
[03:53:57] <Cork> to clone a dom element you need to use .clone()
[03:54:19] <Cork> Rudeboy: so it seams ie don't like the content of the html string
[03:55:08] <Rudeboy> Cork: IE doesn't like much. But at least it's semi working, that's a start :)
[03:55:27] <Cork> heh
[03:55:55] <Cork> well i luckely have been able allowed to drop support for ie < 9
[03:56:07] <Cork> and 10 and 11 is quite nice actually
[03:56:28] <Rudeboy> Cork: Lucky is the right word! I still need to support ie6 in our backward country!
[03:58:05] <Cork> O_o'
[03:58:11] <Cork> Rudeboy: why on earth for??
[03:58:25] <Cork> xp was the last os that came with ie6 by default
[03:58:27] <Cork> and it is eol
[03:58:37] <Rudeboy> Cork: Don't ask me ha ha
[03:58:41] <Cork> i had to fight a little to drop ie8
[03:58:58] <Rudeboy> Cork: But working with anything IE makes me want to punch myself in the face
[03:59:14] <Cork> Rudeboy: cause you are forced to support old none standard ie browsers
[03:59:24] <Cork> ie 10 and 11 is quite standard compliant now days
[03:59:25] <Rudeboy> Cork: Yes
[03:59:32] <Cork> it really isn't the same beast as pre 9
[03:59:43] <Cork> (ie9 is still quite horrible though)
[03:59:56] <Cork> but manageable
[04:02:05] <Rudeboy> Cork: I'm suprised IE6 manages to display color websites
[04:02:16] <Cork> lol
[04:02:19] <Cork> barely
[04:02:40] <Cork> ie6 is a browser still living in the late 90's
[04:02:57] <Cork> so ya... hideously out of date
[04:04:50] <Rudeboy> Cork: Makes you wonder about the people still using it ha ha
[04:05:25] <Cork> ya
[04:06:01] <clarkk> sorry for the easy question, is there anything wrong with this selector?  $('#home', '.tile')    ".tile" elements are being selected but "#home" is not
[04:07:42] <airdem> i want to add all data-ip atribute values into one array. shall i loop through all lis or is there any fancy selector for doing that?
[04:08:35] <airdem> clarkk, $('#home, .tile')
[04:08:49] <airdem> is #home unique?
[04:08:54] <clarkk> yes
[04:09:00] <Rudeboy> Cork: Flip this is irritating. Do you have any possible idea why it won't populate?
[04:09:17] <clarkk> airdem: so the form I was using is not accepted at all?
[04:09:46] <airdem> clarkk, im not sure but i would do it this way $('#home, .tile')
[04:10:16] <airdem> what does console.log($('#home, .tile')) say?
[04:10:31] <airdem> you can enter it into dev console
[04:11:43] <clarkk> airdem: thank you - that was the answer
[04:11:46] <Cork> Rudeboy: when you alert() the .html ie hung
[04:11:55] <Cork> Rudeboy: so i suspect it has something in it ie doesn't like
[04:12:32] <Rudeboy> Cork: If I put the .html alert straight after the success return ,then it works
[04:12:53] <Rudeboy> Cork: I think it was hanging cause I put the alert at the top of the snippet
[04:12:56] <Cork> Rudeboy: uh, success return??
[04:13:13] <Rudeboy> Cork: Success...er...output?
[04:13:21] <Rudeboy> Cork: What would you call it ha ha
[04:13:33] <Cork> not sure what you mean so dono
[04:13:44] <Rudeboy> Cork: Under this: if ( response && !response.error ) {
[04:13:52] <Rudeboy> Cork: Success response?
[04:28:36] <Cork> Rudeboy: ah, so yes before that .html might be blank or something
[04:28:50] <Cork> but that is just content verification
[04:28:53] <Cork> not "return" ;)
[04:33:10] <Rudeboy> Cork: Oh... :)
[04:34:02] <Rudeboy> Cork: I'm really at a loss for what to do. IE breaks my heart
[04:35:53] <batman____> Hello, if I have $(document).on("click",func1),$(document).on("click",func2)
[04:35:58] <batman____> Will they both be attached to document?
[04:37:03] <georgesmith> try it out
[04:37:13] <batman____> Might be easier. Yeah just loaded up jsfiddle
[04:37:14] <batman____> Thanks
[04:37:53] <Cork> batman____: depends if the comma is really there
[04:38:12] <Cork> $(document).on("click",func1); $(document).on("click",func2) will bind two clic events on document
[04:38:22] <Cork> *click
[04:39:43] <batman____> Cork, Okay thank you!
[04:42:12] <Guest13620> I am using "JQueri-UI Dialog"
[04:44:16] <Guest13620> I am facing some issue with that
[04:44:34] <Guest13620> Anyone there ?
[04:44:48] <basiclaser> hey guys can somebody please point me in the right direction. I read quite a bit of the twitter documentation, but I haven't managed to find any tutorials specifically
[04:44:51] <basiclaser> I am new to this API, and my end-goal is to collect a specific hashtag from twitter and display it graphically. I am a JS guy, but I don't mind dipping into ruby/python. PLZ HALP
[04:45:58] <Guest13620> Dialog is getting shown multiple times on the second click of the actionlink
[04:46:15] <Guest13620> anyone aware of why this is happening
[04:46:33] <batman____> Guest13620, Show some code?
[04:47:28] <Guest13620> I have a javascript to show the dialog
[04:48:03] <airdem> $assign.append($items); <-- how do i do the opposite? remove li elements from $assign (its a ul) that are present in $item (array of li objects)
[04:48:08] <Guest13620> I am showing the view as a dialog in my mvc application which gets open on the click of ajax actionlink
[04:49:35] <airdem> $assign.remove($items); just like this?
[04:50:01] <Cork> Guest13620: just guessing but you prob bind the event listener multiple times
[04:51:29] <Guest13620> any help on how can i icheck that
[05:06:01] <airdem> is there an easy way to merge 2 array object and only keep the elements that are in the left array
[05:06:47] <mention> what the best plugin to do 'mention' like facebook and twitter ?
[05:09:31] <Guest13620> Anyone aware  of why the jquery ui dialog is getiing pop up multiple times
[05:09:33] <Guest13620> ?
[05:10:44] <murosai> airdem: that makes no sene
[05:10:46] <murosai> sense
[05:11:44] <airdem> smth like this: A (1,2,3,4) + B (2,3) = C (1,4)
[05:12:18] <Wilfredor> Hi
[05:12:19] <Wilfredor> I want develop a web application for mobile and for desktop, its posible without changing too much code to work on both platforms?
[05:12:22] <murosai> ah ok so it doesn't have anything to do with merge
[05:12:55] <murosai> i'm not sure about an easy way
[05:13:55] <murosai> i think underscore lib should handle it
[05:30:57] <airdem> $assign = $($.grep($assign, function(el) { return $items.filter('li[data-ip="'+$(el).data('ip')+'"]').length ? false : true; })); this works but i wonder if there is a better way to do this
[05:32:19] <ccmonster> what's the best plugin/script for tables?
[05:33:54] <airdem> ccmonster, try dataTables
[05:34:09] <ccmonster> i'm looking at that and dynatable
[05:34:38] <ccmonster> anything else worth a shot?
[05:39:15] <Cork> airdem: wow.. that looks overcomplicated
[05:39:18] * Cork got to run
[05:40:19] <airdem> Cork, have 2 array objects and i am trying to remove all matchting objects from the first array
[05:40:20] <ccmonster> Cork: - data tables looks overly complicated?
[05:41:18] <airdem> ccmonster, it depends on how many features you need, datatables is big but easily customizeable
[05:41:45] <ccmonster> can it filter a list? Like, dropdown filter that can filter the list on a column?
[05:41:50] <ccmonster> not just sort, I guess.
[05:42:01] <airdem> ccmonster, there are demos on the webpge i believe
[05:42:08] <ccmonster> ok, let me look for that
[05:43:59] <ccmonster> airdem: ever seen DynaTables? Looks pretty solid too.
[05:44:05] <Rudeboy> Cork: Are you still around?
[05:48:27] <paulvd> hello, how can i add autoplay to jquery ui tabs ?
[05:50:47] <motaka2> how can I convert a jquery object to html ?
[05:56:36] <Cork> motaka2 $('<div>').html($jqo).html()
[05:56:39] <airdem> Cork, hey! dont just say that its overcomplicated :)
[05:56:49] <Cork> airdem: sorry had to run
[05:56:58] <airdem> give me a better solution if you have one in mind
[05:56:59] <motaka2> Cork: thx
[05:57:30] <Cork> airdem: and all i had the time to see was that it looked overcomplicated
[05:57:34] <airdem> if not, no problem. i mean it works but i realized myself that it's overcomplicated was hoping for a better solution
[05:57:39] <Cork> i need to split that line up to identify what it does
[05:57:57] <airdem> it does this: A (1,2,3,4) + B (2,3) = C (1,4)
[05:58:20] <Cork> airdem: what is $items?
[05:58:34] <Cork> or rather what is it you're trying to do?
[05:58:35] <airdem> $items = B and $assign = A
[05:58:51] <airdem> A (1,2,3,4) + B (2,3) = C (1,4) makes no sense?
[05:59:11] <airdem> the overcomplicated line produces C
[05:59:29] <Cork> so you want to filter out all elements from $assign that exist in $item?
[05:59:33] <Cork> *$items
[05:59:35] <airdem> exactly
[05:59:42] <Cork> $assign.not($items)
[05:59:45] <Cork> :D
[05:59:48] <airdem> fuck me
[06:00:04] <airdem> thats what i was looking for haha, going to test it real quick
[06:00:30] <airdem> does that modify $assign or do i have to $assign = $assign.not($items) ?
[06:00:36] <Cork> later
[06:04:38] <airdem> Cork, does not seem to work, these are the console logs: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f92b0d013f9b1ed6f3f7
[06:05:10] <Cork> airdem: are those the exact same element
[06:05:20] <Cork> or just with the same data-ip string?
[06:05:59] <airdem> $items are clones, i think i have to match the data-ip attribute
[06:06:03] <Cork> ya
[06:06:18] <airdem> does that work with not() ?
[06:06:23] <Cork> no
[06:06:36] <Cork> so var exclude = $.map($items, function(elm) { return $(elm).data('ip'); });
[06:06:47] <paulvd> does .trigger means manual click ?
[06:07:17] <Rudeboy> Cork: Does this make sense to you? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25547673/json-not-populating-dropdown-in-ie8
[06:07:24] <Cork> and then $assign.filter(function() { return $.inArray($(this).data('ip'), exclude) == -1; });
[06:07:30] <Rudeboy> Cork: It's someone's answer to my ie8 JSON problem
[06:08:17] <Cork> so he things appending html in select is the cause
[06:08:29] <Cork> can't say i've seen that in action, but sure you could try it
[06:08:56] <Cork> paulvd: yes and no
[06:09:11] <airdem> Cork, that works, the question is what is the "better" way now? my complicated one or the last one?
[06:09:11] <Cork> paulvd: .trigger triggers the event, but you can't get the browsers default actions
[06:09:29] <Cork> so $('a').trigger('click') WON'T go to the url
[06:10:22] <airdem> i guess yours is better to read/understand
[06:10:26] <Cork> airdem: you run filter on the $items array over and over again
[06:10:34] <Cork> so ya, that code is quite expensive
[06:10:44] <airdem> good to know, thank you very much Cork
[06:10:48] <bweston92> After I do one find I can no long find on that result set, any ideas why?
[06:10:52] <Cork> the one i gave you plucks out the ip from $images
[06:10:56] <Cork> *items
[06:11:06] <Cork> and then it just checks if the ip from the current element is in there
[06:11:21] <Cork> so it is quite a bit less looping
[06:11:30] <Cork> airdem: what browsers do you need to support btw?
[06:11:52] <Cork> cause except.index($(this).data('ip')) is more efficient the $.inArray
[06:11:53] <paulvd> Cork: I want o detect if the user manually clicked on a link, how can i do that?
[06:11:57] <Cork> but doesn't work in older ie
[06:12:06] <airdem> Cork, IE, chrome, FF
[06:12:09] <Cork> paulvd: bind click event handlers
[06:12:13] <Cork> airdem: version of ie
[06:12:13] <airdem> latest versions of course
[06:12:18] <airdem> or 10+
[06:12:34] <Cork> so only ie10+??
[06:13:02] <paulvd> Cork: I am trying to add auto rotate to jquery ui tabs, and also on a tab click, redirect user to another url, but with auto rotate i dont want them to be redirected
[06:13:14] <airdem> Cork,  yes, everything else would be HELL, no?
[06:13:20] <paulvd> i have added both, but its redirecting always
[06:13:36] <Cork> airdem: except.index($(this).data('ip')) === -1 instaed of $.inArray then
[06:13:41] <Cork> airdem: works in ie9+
[06:14:18] <Cork> and will make your code do 2 loops in stead of 1+O^2 loops
[06:14:40] <Cork> airdem: sorry type indexOf not index
[06:14:45] <Cork> *typo
[06:14:48] <Cork> -_-'
[06:15:02] <airdem> and except = exclude i guess
[06:15:16] <Cork> uh what ever i called the variable ^^'
[06:15:21] <Cork> <-- doesn't remember :x
[06:15:28] <airdem> i see, thank you. just wanted to make sure hehe
[06:19:20] <phoenixsun> I have created a search and its results generate divs with content and a button for each line of results. I then created a delegated listener to listen for click on those buttons which works. Now I am missing the way of linking the button click with a function related to its 'line of the results'
[06:19:37] <phoenixsun> is there some code I could look at for direction?
[06:20:40] <phoenixsun> or blog etc
[06:36:07] <Aswebb> Hi
[06:36:14] <Aswebb> is someone here using jvectormap or jqmap?
[06:37:32] <bweston92> Aswebb cannot see JVectorMap anywhere...
[06:37:48] <Aswebb> sorry bweston92?
[06:38:04] <bweston92> Can you tell me where I might find it to have a look at it?
[06:38:19] <bweston92> Aswebb ^
[06:38:58] <Aswebb> http://jqvmap.com/
[06:39:01] <bweston92> Aswebb: Sorry, thought I was in Joomla channel :|
[06:39:06] <Aswebb> no problem :)
[06:39:19] <bweston92> But thanks I needed something like that not to long ago :p
[06:51:08] <zquad> Why is jquery returning an array instead of an object for $('div#adminAdmin div.row a.class_name')  <— even though that is unique?
[06:51:32] <Cork> zquad: jquery always returns an array
[06:51:49] <Cork> well except for a very few methods like .attr('key')
[06:52:09] <zquad> mmmmmmmm
[06:52:14] <Cork> zquad: to be a bit more precise jquery always returns a new instance of it self
[06:52:22] <Cork> and jquery is an array like object
[06:52:32] <zquad> thanks Cork
[06:52:44] <Cork> zquad: what is it you're trying to do?
[06:52:52] <lilsammy> anyone used selectable much?
[06:52:55] <Cork> cause it shouldn't ever cause problems for you
[06:53:02] <lilsammy> got a problem with the selectable option
[06:53:13] <lilsammy> sorry "selected" option
[06:53:18] <Cork> zquad: also don't have element names infront of your ids
[06:54:49] <zquad> Cork:  why not?
[06:55:08] <Cork> zquad: div#id means find all divs
[06:55:13] <Cork> and filter out the one matching the id
[06:55:23] <Cork> instead of just look up the id in the browsers hash table
[06:55:30] <wa5ted> grafi: yo
[06:55:34] <zquad> ooooooohhhhh thanks Cork
[07:02:33] <zquad> so Cork, internally browsers create a hashtable for the dom, what about classes, do they have a table to lookup classes also?
[07:02:47] <Cork> no
[07:03:08] <Cork> browsers hold hash tables for id => dom element mappings
[07:03:26] <Cork> they also keep class => elements mappings
[07:03:41] <Cork> so ids are super fast if you go through those
[07:03:48] <Cork> and classes is slightly slower but still very fast
[07:03:57] <zquad> so something like $('#spAdmin div .settings-section button.group-quote') is as optimized as it can get or should I remove button also?
[07:04:00] <Cork> pure dom element name selectors are slow
[07:04:21] <Cork> zquad: depends on if you need it
[07:04:33] <Cork> the big difference is classes can exist on multiple elements
[07:04:39] <Cork> and id is unique
[07:04:44] <zquad> ok
[07:04:54] <Cork> so if you specify anything before the id it is easy to say it can be optimized
[07:05:03] <Cork> as it will always be unoptimized
[07:05:18] <Cork> optimizing selector is a real thing though
[07:05:25] <Cork> *selectors
[07:08:56] <AlexR2> premature optimization?
[07:15:55] <ccmonster> dataTables mData undefined problem. https://gist.github.com/brjadams/2a1c62dcc58586d2b35d
[07:15:59] <ccmonster> any help appreciated
[07:16:38] <regedit> hello
[07:16:53] <the8thbit|work> Hello
[07:17:17] <ccmonster> hola regedit, the8thbit|work
[07:17:32] <regedit> I have a page with a bunch of click handlers, some of them call click_event.stopPropagation() so as not to trigger nearby unintended ones
[07:17:34] <the8thbit|work> I am using jquery's autocomplete, but I want to modify the selection before I put it in my text box. Is there any way to do this?
[07:18:31] <regedit> now I need to somehow catch *all* clicks for some additional reason, but i'm not getting some clicks which .stopPropagation()
[07:19:08] <regedit> is there some way to hook into jquery internals or .stopPropagation() internals to catch any & all clicks ?
[07:21:02] <ccmonster> modify the selection? what do you mean the8thbit|work
[07:21:16] <ccmonster> you can attach to the windows.click events
[07:21:23] <ccmonster> which would be everything, but kind of heavy, I believe
[07:22:14] <the8thbit|work> ccmonster: The drop down shows a series of strings, say "Blah" followed by a number. So something like:
[07:22:28] <the8thbit|work> "Blah1", "Blah2", "Blah3", etc...
[07:22:39] <the8thbit|work> I only want to put the number in the text box, not the Blah
[07:23:55] <regedit> ccmonster: like this $(window).on('click',...); ? it doesn't seem to receive events that had .stopPropagation() called on them
[07:26:07] <airdem> the8thbit|work, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3884632/how-to-get-the-last-character-of-a-string
[07:26:23] <AlexR2> parseInt(var, 10)
[07:28:57] <airdem> the8thbit|work, maybe like this? $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ change: function(event, ui) { $(this).val(ui.item.text().slide(-1)); } });
[07:29:14] <airdem> slice instead of slide, type
[07:29:19] <airdem> *typo
[07:33:09] <regedit> is there any way to somehow hook into any & all click events EVEN those which called .stopPropagation() ?
[07:33:35] <regedit> perhaps inside jquery event internals or stopPropagation() internals?
[07:41:19] <the8thbit|work> airdem: Hm, that requires the user to blur the text box before it applies the change
[07:42:02] <airdem> the8thbit|work,  select instead of change
[07:42:10] <the8thbit|work> airdem: ah, thanks!
[07:42:12] <airdem> $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ select: function ....
[07:42:16] <ccmonster> regedit: $(window).click(function(){} , is that what you did ?
[07:42:19] <jphase> anyone see a reason why $modal should be string(0) ""  in this example:  http://wpbin.io/5odxq  - my action is rather simple:  add_action( 'wp_footer', 'afkt_subscription_modal' );
[07:43:04] <regedit> ccmonster: actually $(window).on('click keyup',function(){}); why, does that make a difference?
[07:43:16] <the8thbit|work> airdem: hm, select doesn't seem to do anything
[07:43:25] <ccmonster> it's doing both, keyup is entirely diff event
[07:44:07] <airdem> the8thbit|work, $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ change: function(event, ui) { $(this).val(ui.item.label.slide(-1)); } });
[07:44:19] <airdem> or maybe ui.item.value.slice(-1)
[07:44:21] <jphase> sorry folks - wrong room :x
[07:44:31] <airdem> the8thbit|work, check http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[07:44:39] <the8thbit|work> airdem: I'm just setting val to 'test' at the moment, for simplicities sake
[07:44:45] <regedit> ccmonster: this is for a inactivity monitor, if that helps clarify my requirements
[07:44:56] <ccmonster> inactivity monitor?
[07:45:12] <airdem> the8thbit|work,  $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ select: function(event, ui) { $(this).val(ui.item.label.slice(-1)); } });
[07:45:22] <airdem> or $(this).val(ui.item.value.slice(-1));
[07:45:22] <regedit> ccmonster: after a while of inactivity on the page, i want to timeout the user, sorta thing
[07:46:25] <stef1a> how can i select the dynamically added parent of an element? using parent() and closest() just return prevObjects
[07:46:38] <ccmonster> $('body').on("click mousemove keyup", _.debounce(function(){
[07:46:38] <ccmonster>     // do preload here
[07:46:38] <ccmonster> }, 1200000)) // 20 minutes debounce
[07:46:52] <ccmonster> but you'll need underscore to do that
[07:47:32] <ccmonster> regedit: ^
[07:47:34] <regedit> ccmonster: will this capture events from deeper in the DOM upon which .stopPropagation() has been called? according to some tests apparently not...
[07:47:44] <ccmonster> hm, perhaps not.
[07:47:53] <ccmonster> i'm not sure how deep it will track
[07:48:09] <ccmonster> not sure how it would handle event bubbling
[07:48:28] <regedit> this is what i'm trying to figure out, if there's something inside jquery I can hook into for *any & all* events jquery handles
[07:49:00] <regedit> regardless of / before propagation stopping
[07:49:15] <regedit> so that I can act upon all clicks & key presses
[07:49:25] <regedit> even if they eventually stop propagation
[07:49:45] <regedit> because for an inactivity timeout system I need to know about ALL events (even stopped ones)
[07:50:44] <regedit> given I have a page with significant amount of click handlers which need to stopPropagation()
[07:51:21] <droid909> guys i use chrome debugger, and i go step by step, how do i find where it is now, if i lost it?
[07:51:31] <droid909> i.e. on what line in what js fie
[07:51:34] <droid909> file
[07:51:46] <droid909> nm
[07:51:47] <droid909> found
[07:51:56] <regedit> droid909: find the "call stack" tab on the right
[07:52:11] <regedit> droid909: click on the highest one
[07:52:15] <regedit> the one on top
[07:53:46] <droid909> regedit: thank you
[08:02:32] <stef1a> how can i select the dynamically added parent of an element? using parent() and closest() just return prevObjects. here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/9p4zsoy9/1/ see line 13 of the jQuery

[08:33:51] <konradb> hi, how can I refer to .form1, from button? pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nfkrNpHJ
[08:36:20] <pootpoot> Hello. Is there a method that will filter my list of elements ( $('.things') ) to only include "things" where attribute "hello" == "world"?
[08:36:35] <sacho_> .filter()
[08:36:53] <robertmaxrees> pootpoot .filter() :)
[08:36:57] <pootpoot> well then
[08:37:01] <redaxmedia> rofl
[08:37:09] <robertmaxrees> konradb do .div2 and .div1 share a common parent?
[08:37:37] <konradb> robertmaxrees: yeah, call it 'MainDiv'
[08:37:53] <konradb> .parent('div.MainDiv')?
[08:38:05] <robertmaxrees> .closest('.mainDiv').find('.form1')
[08:38:09] <robertmaxrees> would be one way.
[08:38:12] <konradb> .parent('div.MainDiv').find('form.form1')?
[08:38:14] <konradb> hm
[08:38:20] <robertmaxrees> .closest
[08:38:27] <robertmaxrees> if you're starting from the button.
[08:38:37] <pootpoot> can filter use an attribute selector or should i write a quick function to test?
[08:38:57] <robertmaxrees> konradb also, use just the classname if you can - adding the tagname will slow the selector down
[08:39:20] <robertmaxrees> pootpoot you can use an attribute selector or pass in a function - the docs show you how.
[08:40:05] <konradb> robertmaxrees: working, thanks
[08:40:51] <pootpoot> ty

[08:41:34] <Andy_G3> Hi how can i get jquery to automatically click this button: <div class="pressdiv" onclick="alert('you clicked it!');" role="button" aria-label="pressbutton" tabindex="0" ></div> ???
[08:42:49] <robertmaxrees> use javascript for your even binding if you can, and you can use .trigger()
[08:42:55] <robertmaxrees> though that might not work with the inline handler.
[08:43:34] <Andy_G3> well I tried $('pressdiv').trigger('click'); but it doesnt work
[08:43:39] <robertmaxrees> right.
[08:43:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery events are different from native browser events.
[08:43:59] <robertmaxrees> and it'd be .pressdiv btw.
[08:44:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vqhm5L3r/
[08:44:59] <Andy_G3> thankyou robert, i'll try it :)
[08:45:09] <robertmaxrees> also: the console is awesome :)
[08:46:39] <Andy_G3> omg robert I effing love you!!!
[08:46:52] <Andy_G3> Spent bloody ages on this damn problem
[08:46:56] <Andy_G3> works :D
[08:47:44] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[08:54:23] <Cypris> lets i have a <button>text</button>. how do i change it to this <button>text<br/>text2</button> ?
[08:56:06] <NoiseEee> buttonRef.html('text<br>text2');  @ Cypris
[08:57:52] <Cypris> OMG THANK YOU NoiseEee!!! I feel stupid though.
[09:01:55] <stef1a> how can i preserve the text input in a field that i change the html of? changing its html (with replace()) seems to destroy the field input
[09:02:55] <robertmaxrees> stef1a how are you changing the html?
[09:03:11] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: replacing it with regex
[09:03:30] <robertmaxrees> stef1a could you share a fiddle?
[09:04:21] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/9p4zsoy9/3/
[09:05:23] <robertmaxrees> woahdang.
[09:05:33] <robertmaxrees> uuuh, okay - so guide me here. how do I do what you're looking at?
[09:05:44] <stef1a> for some reason they don't remove or add in the fiddle...
[09:05:55] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery saved in there.
[09:06:03] <stef1a> sorry?
[09:06:14] <robertmaxrees> in the upper left, select a jquery version.
[09:06:21] <robertmaxrees> uder "frameworks & extensions"
[09:06:50] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/9p4zsoy9/5/
[09:07:01] <robertmaxrees> so what do I do?
[09:07:44] <stef1a> if you click remove on, say, the second option, it will be removed, and the numbers of the options below it will be bumped down
[09:08:15] <stef1a> the problem is that if any of the fields below it have text in them, removing again, say, the second question) will remove the text in those fields too
[09:08:30] <robertmaxrees> why not just remove the selected element?
[09:08:45] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you need regex for any of this.
[09:08:50] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: because i want to keep the numbers from 1, ..., n
[09:09:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why use regex?  just data attributes.
[09:09:30] <stef1a> 1, 2, 3, 4, not 1, 2, 4, 5
[09:09:31] <robertmaxrees> don't modify the html if you can avoid it.
[09:09:51] <robertmaxrees> and don't use a regex to do it.  just modify the data attributes to fall in the order you need.
[09:09:57] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: you're a few steps ahead of me. could you explain how your statement about not needing regex is related to my problem?
[09:10:15] <Getty> cats
[09:10:17] <robertmaxrees> you're wholesale replacing html, which is generally avoidable.
[09:10:36] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you simply want to track order of the elements, right?
[09:10:50] <stef1a> yes, but they also have classes like options[3]
[09:11:08] <robertmaxrees> still don't need to run regex against the entire element :)
[09:11:57] <robertmaxrees> if you want to edit classes, use .prop('class'), run your regex against just that, then use .prop('class', newString) to replace the classes with your new stuff.
[09:14:10] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: wouldn't i have to do that piecemeal, though? a different expression / replacement for each time [3] appears?
[09:14:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[09:15:25] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: see lines 33-36 in the HTML. [2] appears 4 times
[09:15:41] <robertmaxrees> right.  enumerate over your remaining inputs and edit them.
[09:15:43] <stef1a> 5 if you count the label
[09:17:11] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: will prop() scan the children / all the text in the current object?
[09:17:14] <robertmaxrees> by completely replacing the element, you'll have to setup some way to maintain state information for each input and their values.
[09:17:27] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: yes, i have gathered that :-)
[09:17:37] <robertmaxrees> .prop() only operates against the selected element.
[09:17:39] <stef1a> err, i have figured that out, based on what you told me...
[09:17:41] <robertmaxrees> you use it instead of .attr()
[09:17:55] <Andy_G3> hey how does it work if i've got multiple of the same divs?  At the moment it's clicking them all.. I wanna click the first one: $('.pressdiv').trigger('click');
[09:18:00] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: but does it scan everything inside the element, i.e., not just the tags?
[09:18:07] <robertmaxrees> stef1a huh?
[09:18:12] <robertmaxrees> "scan" whatnow?
[09:18:16] <stef1a> you say that a lot. :-)
[09:18:34] <robertmaxrees> .prop() works only against the element you've selected.
[09:18:57] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 check out .eq()
[09:19:03] <Andy_G3> ok
[09:19:10] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: if i have <tag id="blah"><nav class="another-thing">...</nav></tag>, and i use prop on the entire object, will it look at the id of just <tag>, or everything within <tag>?
[09:19:21] <robertmaxrees> just the tag, like attr would.
[09:19:45] <stef1a> oh... so i have to find each element individually ;-(
[09:19:53] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[09:19:56] <robertmaxrees> you're making this too hard.
[09:20:01] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:22:18] <Andy_G3> so $('.pressdiv').eq(0).trigger('click'); ?
[09:22:38] <robertmaxrees> did you try? :)
[09:22:53] <Andy_G3> no one sec
[09:23:49] <robertmaxrees> stef1a - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x82ogrnc/
[09:23:57] <robertmaxrees> minimal example, but it should make sense.
[09:25:13] <Andy_G3> yes, it works thanks, but for some reason, the first time I tried it it kept clicking the first button over and over
[09:25:27] <Andy_G3> came up with 7 dialogs
[09:25:28] <Balzy> hello! I've been able to fade in and out <div> sections with jquery (clicking images), but when I first load the page all the <div> section are visible. how can I show only the default one? Is there a css parameter I must set?
[09:25:58] <Andy_G3> it works most of the time
[09:26:08] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 mind sharing your code?
[09:26:12] <Andy_G3> ok
[09:26:16] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: woah. cool! thank you so much.
[09:26:17] <robertmaxrees> stef1a a functioning example here -> jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x82ogrnc/1/
[09:26:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:26:45] <robertmaxrees> Balzy default them all to hidden and add a class to the active one that shows it.
[09:28:39] <Balzy> robertmaxrees if I set them to hidden when I fade them in they're not visible
[09:28:53] <robertmaxrees> how are you hiding them?
[09:28:55] <robertmaxrees> display: none;?
[09:28:59] <Balzy> with fadeIn(seconds)
[09:29:05] <robertmaxrees> (without seeing your code I have literally no idea what you're doing :))
[09:29:19] <Balzy> right, let me paste it
[09:29:31] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be the best :)
[09:30:21] <Andy_G3> http://jsfiddle.net/kkwoa322/
[09:30:42] <robertmaxrees> why are you using a settimeout?
[09:31:11] <robertmaxrees> and don't use inline event handlers...
[09:31:11] <Andy_G3> want to delay the click
[09:31:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not what that's doing...
[09:31:33] <Balzy> http://pastebin.com/TVgjJxny robertmaxrees a fiddle?
[09:31:39] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle
[09:32:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:32:05] <Andy_G3> google told me it was ^^
[09:32:14] <Balzy> ah let me try
[09:32:22] <menikmati> Lets save I have var scripts = document.getElementsByTagName("script"); and want to access the second element using script[2]. How do you do this in jquery?
[09:32:24] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 your code only delays adding the event binding - why would you do that?
[09:32:31] <robertmaxrees> menikmati .eq or .get
[09:32:35] <menikmati> thanks
[09:32:37] <Andy_G3> hmmm.
[09:32:41] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: could i find each child recursively down the dom tree from the form-group and apply that prop thing to each tag? or would i run into the same problem i ran into before doing so?
[09:33:05] <robertmaxrees> stef1a you can use .find() and select all relevant elements.
[09:33:08] <Andy_G3> I could put timeout around just $('.pressdiv').eq(0).trigger('click');  instead?
[09:33:17] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 why do you want to delay it?
[09:33:26] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: yeah, that's what i mean, i think... won't that select all the children recursively?
[09:33:26] <nettoweb> guys, Im getting this erro: ‘Unknown action’ but my routes is ok…  forum GET    /forum/:id(.:format)                                     forum#show
[09:33:32] <robertmaxrees> stef1a .find('span, div, input') will do all spans, divs, and inputs.
[09:33:40] <JohnFree> Hey guys. I'm using "$(document).ready()" but jquery still doesn't iterate over div's of class "remember-me", as the DOM-elements aren't loaded at the time I'm trying to access these elements. How can I fix this?
[09:33:43] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: oh, sweet. that's great. thanks!
[09:33:43] <Andy_G3> I dont want it to click as soon as the page loads.  want to click it 10 secs later
[09:33:48] <nettoweb> when access /forum/foobar I get Unknown action
[09:33:59] <nettoweb> ops
[09:34:05] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 you mean the trigger?  why?
[09:34:24] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree fire an event and bind to that instead, or proxy through the done callback of whatever adds the elements.
[09:34:38] <Balzy> http://jsfiddle.net/kkwoa322/ robertmaxrees here it is!
[09:34:56] <robertmaxrees> Balzy that's the one Andy_G3 just sent me lol
[09:35:00] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Why doesn't "document.ready()" work as it is supposed to be?
[09:35:15] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree you said you're adding things after the page loads, right?
[09:35:35] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what that event actually means.
[09:35:39] <dmsuperman> JohnFree: It does. The document is ready the moment the HTML is completely loaded and rendered. whatever happens after that (Js inserting nodes into the DOM) is separate form the document being ready
[09:35:43] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: I'm adding attributes to existing DOM elements
[09:35:48] <Balzy> robertmaxrees this one should be mine: http://jsfiddle.net/kkwoa322/2/
[09:36:00] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman++
[09:36:04] <dmsuperman> if the element already exists then your selector will definitely be able to find it in the document.ready method
[09:36:11] <robertmaxrees> Balzy so what are you trying to do here?
[09:36:45] <JohnFree> But I'm using an extra $document.ready() before trying to access the html elements. But when I'm trying to iterate over the div's, somehow they don't exist at that timestamp
[09:36:52] <Andy_G3> maybe i just dont know properly what trigger does.  But thinking about it from a user standpoint.  i want it to automatically click the button 10 seconds later, rather than as soon as the page loads
[09:37:01] <Balzy> robertmaxrees a kind of "dashboard" where clinking on each image display the appropriate section of text
[09:37:01] <robertmaxrees> Johnathan1707 there's only one document ready.
[09:37:13] <robertmaxrees> err, JohnFree
[09:37:15] <robertmaxrees> if you make more than one, they all listen for the same event
[09:38:44] <robertmaxrees> it's not a "timestamp" thing.
[09:38:44] <Balzy> robertmaxrees problem is, when you have just loaded the page, you see all the sections, I want to show only section one
[09:38:50] <robertmaxrees> Balzy works for me?
[09:38:52] <robertmaxrees> only the relevant one is highlighted.
[09:38:56] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: So if I insert a new attribute or html-content (value) to an loaded / existing DOM-Element, how can I find out, if the HTML-page is ready after inserting the change?
[09:38:56] <Andy_G3> Basically i saw the wait 5 seconds function here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1836105/how-to-wait-5-seconds-with-jquery
[09:38:56] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 so your code waits 10 seconds to bind the function, then fires the trigger.
[09:39:01] <robertmaxrees> you only need that setTimeout around the trigger,.
[09:39:19] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree via the function that did the work.
[09:39:23] <Andy_G3> yes,
[09:39:31] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: it's working :-D i'll update you when i finish everything
[09:39:41] <Andy_G3> That's waht I said first when you explained it. :D thankyou.
[09:39:57] <robertmaxrees> Andy_G3 that's just a strange thing to want to do.
[09:39:58] <phoenixsun> I have an logic disconnect with connecting my search result buttons with the action they should take related to the result 'line' - http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=wB8901V785
[09:39:58] <Andy_G3> Ur like superman. helping so many all at once lol
[09:40:05] <robertmaxrees> and get right of those onclick handlers.
[09:40:29] <phoenixsun> yeah I don't know how robertmaxrees does it
[09:40:40] <robertmaxrees> i manage context really well in my head.
[09:40:42] <dmsuperman> Andy_G3: http://jsfiddle.net/8zLa2pLr/1/
[09:40:43] <Balzy> robertmaxrees: found this in the doc: The .fadeOut() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. Once the opacity reaches 0, the display style property is set to none, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page.
[09:40:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm also getting legit work done.
[09:41:00] <Balzy> robertmaxrees: if I set display to none it should work
[09:41:07] <robertmaxrees> Balzy there you go then.
[09:41:48] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: I have a fiddle. If you could take a look - http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=wB8901V785
[09:41:51] <Andy_G3> lol ^^ actually I think you're super-women then, casue u can mutli-task so well
[09:42:03] <robertmaxrees> lol "super-women"?
[09:42:11] <robertmaxrees> aaaah togetherjs
[09:42:35] <Andy_G3> lol women :facepalm:
[09:42:46] <robertmaxrees> i AM a dude, i assure you ;)
[09:42:47] <Andy_G3> u get what I mean
[09:43:01] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun so what's going on here?
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> what are you confused by?
[09:44:03] <Andy_G3> I know rob, was just messing :p
[09:44:25] <robertmaxrees> it's all good mang :)
[09:44:36] <phoenixsun> in the fiddle the '>>' represents the button. What I want to be able to do is have the button access the index variable from object that was using to create the result line
[09:45:05] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[09:45:08] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[09:45:17] <robertmaxrees> i see - your object isn't good for something like this :)
[09:45:24] <phoenixsun> right :)
[09:45:52] <robertmaxrees> first off that index property is replicating the position of the object - which is strange.  use a plain old object.
[09:46:11] <JohnFree> So I don't understand why I can't use "document.ready()" each time I change a DOM element? It represents the state of the page?
[09:46:29] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree the document ready event fires once when the page is "ready"
[09:46:33] <phoenixsun> there is a reason that its like that cos in the real data is doesn't always replicate the position of the object
[09:46:38] <robertmaxrees> which happens after pageload.
[09:46:39] <robertmaxrees> once.,
[09:47:14] <robertmaxrees> phoenixsun don't use an array for this - kind a good key and use that instead.
[09:47:56] <robertmaxrees> *find a good key
[09:47:56] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Yes, but when I change the page after it is ready, doesn't it throw a new "ready" event as soon as I changed the DOM?
[09:47:56] <robertmaxrees> either way, give your results some bit of data that relates back to the object the relate to.
[09:47:56] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree nope
[09:47:57] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree it throws a single ready after pageload and never again.
[09:47:57] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Wow. That's creepy behaviour ..
[09:48:00] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:48:02] <robertmaxrees> it's smart behavior.
[09:48:03] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: I didn't knew that
[09:48:07] <JohnFree> :)
[09:48:12] <JohnFree> Than I'm creepy :)
[09:48:18] <robertmaxrees> the document as sent from the server is ready.
[09:48:39] <robertmaxrees> you can emit your own events and bind to those, too.
[09:48:44] <phoenixsun> robertmaxrees: thats what occurred to me but I was wondering what the smart approach would be but I will try and cook up something
[09:49:21] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Ok thanks
[09:49:28] <JohnFree> I'l try that out now
[09:49:53] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree the other way to do it is to put your logic into a callback when your manipulation is done.
[09:49:59] <robertmaxrees> or do your manipulation server-side.
[09:53:45] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: thanks again -- it works perfectly. however, i had to use one expression per prop -- i couldn't do what you suggested with prop('id, name, label'). are you sure that i can set multiple at once? is there another way?
[09:53:55] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[09:53:57] <robertmaxrees> .find()
[09:54:04] <robertmaxrees> .prop() works with one prop at a time.
[09:54:53] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: oh, i see. well i think i need to separate them, then, because almost each element uses a different prop
[09:55:14] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that?
[09:55:22] <robertmaxrees> unless your backend is really strange.
[09:57:08] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: here: http://jsfiddle.net/9p4zsoy9/7/ the backend is a little bit odd.
[09:57:19] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Where shall I throw my own events?
[09:57:40] <JohnFree> In the space, where I change the DOM-Elements?
[09:58:33] <stef1a> lines 19-24 in the jq show what i mesn
[09:58:35] <stef1a> mean*
[10:02:55] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree wherever you want?
[10:03:06] <robertmaxrees> JohnFree after you make your changes would be smartest.
[10:03:15] <JohnFree> robertmaxrees: Ok thanks :)
[10:03:54] <robertmaxrees> stef1a why do you need to have all of those with that number though?
[10:17:55] <uskerine> hi, how do you usually expand a menu with JQuery? http://pastebin.com/rmc6SDdj
[10:18:06] <uskerine> that's what clicking does, but how should it be done in JQuery
[10:18:12] <uskerine> I think menus are from bootstrap
[10:18:47] <robertmaxrees> bwuh?
[10:18:52] <robertmaxrees> add/remove a class.
[10:20:26] <sniperh4x0r> i'm trying to write a statment like:  if (isMobile){  *load css sheet* }
[10:20:34] <sniperh4x0r> I'm having trouble on the load css sheet part
[10:20:38] <robertmaxrees> use media queries instead.
[10:20:41] <sniperh4x0r> how do you write html inside of js?
[10:20:49] <sniperh4x0r> my company wants it done this way
[10:21:18] <uskerine> $('#fooMenu a').removeClass("level-closed");      $('#fooMenu a').addClass("level-opened");     $('#fooMenu ul').css("display","block");
[10:21:19] <sniperh4x0r> the media queries are in the style sheet i want to load
[10:21:19] <robertmaxrees> :( that's kind of weird.  you'll have to append a style tag somewhere.
[10:21:21] <uskerine> should that work?
[10:21:42] <robertmaxrees> uskerine did you try?
[10:21:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r $('body').append('<style type="text/css" src="/path/to/file.css"></style>'); something like this.
[10:22:32] <uskerine> i did
[10:22:45] <uskerine> and i end up with <a> "expand level-closed level-opened"
[10:22:46] <sniperh4x0r> that's pretty simple thanks robertmaxrees
[10:22:54] <uskerine> and with <ul> still with "display: none;"
[10:23:05] <robertmaxrees> uskerine i don't know what your html and css look like.  fiddle?
[10:23:09] <uskerine> any idea on why that could be happening or how to further debug?
[10:23:19] <robertmaxrees> make sure your selectors are right.
[10:23:32] <robertmaxrees> and that you're not getting caught in weird eventing problems/.
[10:23:35] <uskerine> I think they are
[10:23:59] <robertmaxrees> then maybe an eventing problem?
[10:24:01] <uskerine> might it be the order of invoking those changes? how can you further debug that part?
[10:24:04] <robertmaxrees> check your bindings and stuff.
[10:24:08] <uskerine> how do i troubleshoot events?
[10:24:28] <uskerine> i am using lots of already made plugins to be honest I don't know how to start what do you usually do ?
[10:24:32] <robertmaxrees> by looking at your event bindings and using the step debugger and/or console.log()s
[10:25:05] <uskerine> how can i check event bindings? is there something like step debugger?
[10:25:35] <uskerine> can i set up a breakpoint at that point in JQuery and see what is going on?
[10:26:08] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to check in jquery.
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> you want to check your code.
[10:26:29] <uskerine> well I mean in my code
[10:26:31] <robertmaxrees> all browsers have step debuggers now.  use 'em.
[10:27:42] <uskerine> I see it in firefox now
[10:27:45] <uskerine> and i set up the breakpoint
[10:27:51] <uskerine> i didn't know you could do that
[10:27:52] <uskerine> thanks
[10:31:43] <tocka> hi guys
[10:32:23] <tocka> i have kind of a problem, i am adding a radio box with jquery and then after im trying to check is it being checked or not, but nothing is happening. If I add the radio box manually then everything works
[10:32:27] <tocka> Where is the problem? :(
[10:33:25] <uskerine> did you add radio box "on document ready"?
[10:33:31] <tocka> yes
[10:33:35] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[10:33:47] <tocka> could you elaborate on that robertmaxrees
[10:33:48] <tocka> ?
[10:34:15] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('change', 'target', function() {});
[10:34:34] <robertmaxrees> where "target" is the current selector you're binding against, and "parent" is an ancestor that exists on pageload.
[10:34:47] <tocka> ooo this is tricky ;)
[10:34:51] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[10:34:58] <robertmaxrees> events "bubble up" through the document.
[10:35:20] <robertmaxrees> this binds a listener that listens for these bubbled events.
[10:36:15] <robertmaxrees> the documentation for .on() talks about it some more.
[10:36:26] <tocka> thanks, I will look at it now :)
[10:37:16] <ubilli8> please when i do a on("submit") it post three times to the server please what can i do to make it one post...
[10:37:26] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ ubilli8
[10:37:27] <b-ot> ubilli8: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:37:52] <ubilli8> am coming please...
[10:43:24] <ubilli8> ok this is the link...
[10:44:05] <ubilli8> http://jsfiddle.net/88qw6k8d
[10:45:20] <robertmaxrees> only submitting once for me...
[10:46:03] <robertmaxrees> oh, heh, you're mixing some stuff up.
[10:46:04] <ubilli8> it is submit three times through ajax i forget to mention...
[10:46:09] <robertmaxrees> where is addapetformbox?
[10:46:33] <ubilli8> well it another form...
[10:46:42] <robertmaxrees> this doens't make any sense then...
[10:46:56] <robertmaxrees> what does the HTML you showed me have to do with the js you showed me?
[10:47:06] <ubilli8> no it is multiple form...
[10:47:47] <robertmaxrees> huh? what does the html have to do with the js you shared?
[10:47:53] <ubilli8> well you can just use the js... but when i connect it to the db it post three data .
[10:48:21] <robertmaxrees> unless you're triple-clicking or triggering multiple clicks, you should be fine.
[10:49:15] <ubilli8> when i inspect it on inspector on a click it show ls three loops of post data..
[10:49:59] <robertmaxrees> no way i can help without seeing an actual indicative example.  sorry!
[10:50:09] <robertmaxrees> somebody else might have an idea though.
[10:50:12] <ubilli8> ok... cool...
[10:50:24] <sniperh4x0r> argh this line just doesn't want to work for me on my site $('head').append( $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />').attr('href', '_css/mobile.css') );
[10:50:28] <ubilli8> i will just google it then...
[10:50:30] <sniperh4x0r> how do i trouble shoot why it wont work?
[10:52:42] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r use .prop() instead.  any network errors?
[10:52:58] <kanzie> so I have a bunch of code using Object.observe() and now I need to get this running in Safari. Is there a shim or implementation that I can just slide in there without having to change my code?
[10:53:37] <kanzie> Watch.js was to different
[10:53:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a bold move.
[10:54:47] <robertmaxrees> only supported in chrome.  no ff, IE, or safari support, and it's apart of ES7, which is one version beyond the one currently being focused on lol
[10:55:29] <kanzie> robertmaxrees: yep, well that wasnt a problem until the reqs suddenly changed
[10:55:44] <kanzie> or rather, that is the only one thing keeping my app from working on all webkit so...
[10:55:50] <sniperh4x0r> robertmaxrees: i don't see anything in my console after adding prop
[10:56:38] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r you want to edit the DOM node, not the html.  that's actually the correct way to do it ;)
[10:56:46] <robertmaxrees> the inspector won't update, which is fine :)
[10:58:29] <sniperh4x0r> how do you edit a dom node, i'm rather confused
[10:58:33] <sniperh4x0r> here is my site: http://neoscapelabs.com/projects/rxr_northhills/index.php
[10:58:39] <sniperh4x0r> just look at source
[10:59:03] <sniperh4x0r> maybe you can see why that head').append line isn't working and it's more obvious to you
[11:00:11] <alyx1> Hi guys. Can someone please tell me if this is possible or not. I believe this shouldn't work. Example: User visits mypage.com. User then clicks button on page to google.com. User gets forcefully redirected back to mypage.com
[11:01:27] <robertmaxrees> sniperh4x0r you want to edit properties, not attributes :)
[11:01:51] <robertmaxrees> alyx1 it's possible, if strange.
[11:02:05] <sniperh4x0r> so don't use attr ?
[11:02:12] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[11:02:22] <alyx1> robertmaxrees: So it is. What does it require? Iframe hacks?
[11:02:25] <robertmaxrees> what's the url of the stylesheet you're trying to add?
[11:02:31] <robertmaxrees> alyx1 huh?
[11:02:47] <robertmaxrees> you bind an event listenet to that link and cancel link clicks on it.
[11:02:50] <alyx1> I was reading about iframe proxying
[11:03:03] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm not clear about what you're actually trying to do - mind explaining a little more?
[11:03:10] <alyx1> Okay let me try
[11:03:18] <sniperh4x0r> http://neoscapelabs.com/projects/rxr_northhills/_css/mobile.css this line still doesn't work $('head').append( $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />').prop('href', '_css/mobile.css') );
[11:03:26] <sniperh4x0r> robertmaxrees:
[11:03:53] <robertmaxrees> why edit one prop like thgat?
[11:04:18] <sniperh4x0r> what should i be writing then? i dont get it
[11:04:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just use?
[11:04:46] <robertmaxrees> err
[11:04:48] <robertmaxrees> $('<link href="_css/mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />')
[11:04:56] <robertmaxrees> why edit the href prop differently than the other props?
[11:05:49] <alyx1> What I'm trying to accomplish is: After a user clicks-through a button on mypage.com. He is redirected to http://google.com and then redirected to mypage2.com all within the same window.
[11:06:09] <robertmaxrees> alyx1 why?
[11:06:30] <alyx1> Does this fit cross-site scripting?
[11:06:34] <sniperh4x0r> robertmaxrees:  $('head').append( $('<link href="_css/mobile.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />') );   still doesn't work
[11:06:37] <alyx1> I'm trying to figure out if this is even possible
[11:06:43] <alyx1> Everything is telling me it shouldn't work
[11:07:12] <blez> someone knows how to detect focus change globally?
[11:07:30] <blez> like $('*').live('focus', function(e) { ... });
[11:07:59] <SoggyDingus> Hi everyone, I got a question that I can't seem to find the answer to online
[11:08:19] <SoggyDingus> I'm looking for a way to highlight text within a div from user input
[11:09:00] <robert0> woops connection dropped.
[11:09:04] <robert0> woops connection dropped.
[11:09:06] <robert0> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11833777/923919
[11:09:20] <robert0> drop the extra fragment - just append the string.  see if that works?
[11:16:55] <uskerine> robertmaxrees moving the removeClass addClass and show() for expanding the menu to the end of all .js's make them work
[11:16:59] <uskerine> so I'll live with that
[11:24:40] <F1skr> Hello, anyone using browserify with jQuery? I'm wondering how you go about managing jquery plugins using npm/browserify rather than defining them in your html, if it's even possible.
[11:24:54] <dmsuperman> blez: input focus?
[11:25:09] <dmsuperman> blez: $(document).on('focus', ':input', function() I think will work
[11:25:20] <kegster> i can just use update_post_meta() on an attachment, rather than wp_update_attachment_metadata() ?
[11:25:23] <kegster> correct? ;)
[11:25:27] <kegster> oops
[11:25:40] <kegster> sorry about that
[11:52:21] <blez> any way to simulate keypress?
[11:53:42] <robertmaxrees> .trigger('keypress')
[12:15:10] <RhinoBoss> I have a sortable that the user can add items to. I have a click callback when one of the items is selected, and that is setup/called at the beginning of the code, after the initial list items are populated. How can I make it to that additional list items trigger the click callback if they are added post-initialization?
[12:15:42] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation
[12:19:35] <RhinoBoss> robertmaxrees: thanks, should work
[12:19:51] <robertmaxrees> the docs for .on() have a wealth of good info in there.
[12:27:39] <stef1a> i have $(this).closest('tr').children('td')[0]; which yields <td>Stuff in cell</td>. How can I get just the stuff in the cell and not the tags? Using .text() and .html() yield "undefined is not a function"
[12:30:12] <robertmaxrees> [0] gets the raw dom node instead of the jquery object.
[12:30:25] <robertmaxrees> you want .eq(0) instead.
[12:31:45] <msafi> Guys, in website design, do you know what's the technical name of the large image that's usually at the top, like on Medium, the main image of the post at the top?
[12:32:33] <paulvd> Hello, I am trying to make a three level mobile menu, but on the 2nd sub menu item, something strange happens... http://jsfiddle.net/yy33h7d7/1/
[12:33:03] <dmsuperman> msafi: a banner?
[12:33:18] <msafi> dmsuperman: I don't think that's what they call it.
[12:34:17] <dmsuperman> then I think you need to give more details msafi
[12:34:29] <dmsuperman> every designer I've ever worked iwth has called the wide image across the top of a page a banner
[12:34:36] <msafi> dmsuperman: are you familiar with Medium?
[12:34:42] <dmsuperman> I am not
[12:34:46] <dmsuperman> can you give a screenshot?
[12:34:49] <msafi> Just a sec
[12:35:54] <msafi> So, many pages on the internet these days have flat design with minimal colors, they get their character from this top image, like this post on Medium
[12:35:55] <msafi> https://medium.com/culture-club/mh-17-left-amsterdam-fcef850b1fec
[12:36:12] <msafi> It has this huge image at the top, then you scroll down to read the post
[12:36:32] <msafi> Facebook has something like this, and twitter too…
[12:36:44] <msafi> Which reminds me, maybe I should just go check what Twitter and Facebook call it
[12:37:01] <dmsuperman> ohhh
[12:37:08] <elmcrest> Hi all. I append a table row via $().click to a table, with one button within it with a id="someButton". Now jquery doesn't react to the click event on the new button. Does anyone has a hint for me? do I maybe have to "reinit" the jquery or something?
[12:37:14] <dmsuperman> I see what you mean now. let me ask a friend
[12:37:33] <NoiseEee> msafi: i think the term is "annoying" and/or "unoriginal"  :P
[12:37:42] <dmsuperman> well that's certainly true :P
[12:38:21] <msafi> Okay, so on Facebook they call it cover photo and on Twitter they call it background image
[12:38:48] <msafi> I don't think it's unoriginal or annoying. It's an easy way to let the user create a unique personal character of their page without them having to redesign the whole thing
[12:39:38] <dmsuperman> it's quite unoriginal. it's been done to death
[12:40:13] <dmsuperman> designer friends are saying they would still call that a banner
[12:41:00] <dmsuperman> ah here you go http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_image
[12:41:15] <msafi> Oh, so it is hero image!
[12:41:34] <msafi> I have a colleague who calls it hero image, I thought that was stupid
[12:41:53] <elmcrest> nevermind, this helped me out :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20253246/adding-click-event-for-a-button-created-dynamically-using-jquery
[12:42:04] <dmsuperman> fwiw a friend of mine was saying they were stale about 4 years ago when I worked with him msafi
[12:42:06] <paulvd> i added class to sub menu li's but still no luck ? jsfiddle.net/yy33h7d7/2/
[12:42:12] <dmsuperman> and if they were stale 4 years ago...they're definitely unoriginal now :P
[12:42:16] <paulvd> jsfiddle.net/yy33h7d7/2/
[13:03:29] <sniperh4x0r> Anyone know how I can pull these images from xml rather than regular http links? http://jsfiddle.net/hqehj8f9/1/
[13:04:13] <sniperh4x0r> i know how to load in xml thru php by appending html to a php variable but i don't know how to grab xml thru javascript
[13:06:54] <elmcrest> can I get all children of a tr element that have a name attribute?
[13:09:00] <dmsuperman> elmcrest: yes
[13:09:09] <dmsuperman> elmcrest: do you want form inputs only?
[13:09:26] <elmcrest> dmsuperman no from tds
[13:09:29] <elmcrest> td-s
[13:09:41] <elmcrest> dmsuperman this doesn't work console.log($(this).find("td[name=*]").html()); :)
[13:09:50] <elmcrest> neither with children instead of find()
[13:09:57] <dmsuperman> why do you have name attributes on tds?
[13:10:07] <elmcrest> I thought that might work :)
[13:10:17] <dmsuperman> what's the name attribute for?
[13:10:31] <elmcrest> ehm names?
[13:10:32] <elmcrest> :)
[13:10:46] <dmsuperman> I would use data-name then if you're not intending to treat it like an actual name
[13:11:02] <dmsuperman> adds confusion when there are elements that have real names
[13:11:05] <elmcrest> sounds reasonable
[13:11:10] <dmsuperman> anyway to answer your question
[13:11:11] <dmsuperman> td[name]
[13:11:17] <dmsuperman> will find any td with a name attribute specified
[13:11:27] <dmsuperman> or td[data-name] ;)
[13:11:34] <elmcrest> yes ok
[13:12:47] <elmcrest> dmsuperman ok that kind of works, but I only get the first td ... $(this).children("td[data-name]").html()
[13:13:04] <elmcrest> thats within a each ... wait I should paste that I guess
[13:13:20] <dmsuperman> well that's correct
[13:13:30] <dmsuperman> .html when given a collection of objects will return only the first object's html
[13:13:39] <dmsuperman> same with most jquery methods like that
[13:13:51] <dmsuperman> if you want all of them, you need to use a .each and fetch each .html individually
[13:14:08] <elmcrest> here the mess :) https://dpaste.de/H36p
[13:15:48] <elmcrest> dmsuperman ok without the html() I get all tds
[13:17:02] <elmcrest> dmsuperman Or do I have the each() on the wrong place?
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> closest('tr') returns one element
[13:17:56] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees ok ... I changed to first get the children and each() after that
[13:18:06] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:18:13] <dmsuperman> I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do. but my guess is you want $(this).closest('tr').find('td[data-name]').each(function() { ... fetch html here });
[13:18:51] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees dmsuperman  works :) ... https://dpaste.de/a0Gx
[13:19:04] <elmcrest> dmsuperman is find() better than children() ?
[13:19:21] <robertmaxrees> .find() will go through all descendents, instead of just the first level.
[13:19:25] <robertmaxrees> it's also generally faster.
[13:19:32] <elmcrest> ok, faster counts :)
[13:19:39] <elmcrest> first level would be enough though
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> still faster in that case.
[13:20:45] <elmcrest> btw I have a tablerow in which a button exists, the goal is, to get the data from the tablewor tds without the button of course - than POST the data and eleminate the button from that row :)
[13:21:05] <elmcrest> I guess that sounds more complicated that it is
[13:21:22] <dmsuperman> are the TDs contenteditable ?
[13:21:46] <elmcrest> dmsuperman yes
[13:21:54] <robertmaxrees> i'm not even sure what you're actually trying to do lol
[13:22:16] <dmsuperman> looks like inline editing of a big table of shit
[13:22:26] <dmsuperman> not how I would do it exactly but not terrible
[13:22:42] <elmcrest> not that big, but space saving :)
[13:23:32] <elmcrest> another idea was to POST the data on an event - but what would work there? ... I mean I can't post to my server every time the focus is changed for example
[13:23:41] <dmsuperman> sure you can!
[13:24:05] <elmcrest> really? seems a bit like bitching the server to me :)
[13:24:33] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on if you'd rather lots of small transactions, or fewer large transactions.
[13:24:38] <dmsuperman> well you would only send if data changed. and how fast can people really be editing? though your approach gives people time to confirm changes
[13:25:21] <dmsuperman> I do a bit of both. You click a single cell, that cell becomes editable and has a little checkmark button to save changes
[13:25:26] <dmsuperman> so it's per-cell not per-row
[13:25:37] <elmcrest> hmm ok ... can I use the focus of the complete row? ... like when I jump from td to td, it doesn't call the event?
[13:25:57] <dmsuperman> my thought process there is, if somebody else edits the page at the same time, I would rather only edit the field that the user intended to edit in case of race conditions
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:26:16] <robertmaxrees> elmcrest you can use the change event
[13:26:27] <dmsuperman> bingo
[13:26:39] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees the complete row gets created ... so every character could be a change
[13:26:56] <robertmaxrees> change only fires when the input loses focus ;)
[13:27:07] <elmcrest> I have no Inputs :D
[13:27:30] <elmcrest> but that probably would be a reason to use those old skool things :)
[13:27:51] <dmsuperman> I wonder if contenteditable fields trigger change /keyup/keydown events like form fields
[13:27:58] <dmsuperman> only way to find out is to try elmcrest
[13:27:59] <dmsuperman> ;P
[13:28:10] <robertmaxrees> you could use blur, too.
[13:28:59] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees In recent browsers, the domain of the event has been extended to include all element types.  sounds good :)
[13:29:05] <elmcrest> blur()
[13:29:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:29:23] <elmcrest> before was input or form fields only
[13:29:37] <elmcrest> http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[13:29:45] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer .on() in general, but ok.
[13:30:31] <robertmaxrees> ah i see what that does
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[13:30:49] <elmcrest> robertmaxrees I don't understand how .on() can trigger the focus stuff ... ?
[13:31:01] <robertmaxrees> trigger or bind to the event?
[13:31:10] <elmcrest> hmm I don't know, sry :D
[13:31:28] <elmcrest> I use .on('click' ... that's a bind, right?
[13:31:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:31:49] <elmcrest> ah ok ... .on('focus' ?
[13:32:01] <robertmaxrees> all of the events can be used that way.
[13:32:56] <elmcrest> anyway I have to go to bed ... after around 16 hours of coding my brain doesn't work anymore
[13:33:12] <elmcrest> but thx a lot robertmaxrees and dmsuperman
[13:33:21] <sssilver> Guys, I'm pulling my hair... pls tell me why http://plnkr.co/edit/c7Sa2bHsY2YkZqnRCvQX?p=preview doesn't generate keypresses!
[13:34:43] <robertmaxrees> sssilver you want keypress or keydown?
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> also, your nd dmsuperman
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> [2014:08:28:13:33:21] <sssilver> Guys, I'm pulling my hair... pls tell me why http://plnkr.co/edit/c7Sa2bHsY2YkZqnRCvQX?p=preview doesn't generate keypresses!

[13:35:44] <robertmaxrees> woops!
[13:35:53] <robertmaxrees> e.keyCode isn't defined with that trigger.
[13:36:27] <dmsuperman> lol robertmaxrees always mispasting
[13:36:35] <robertmaxrees> the one thing I hate about mirc.
[13:39:34] <stef1a> i have a form that shows up twice on one page, each time within a different div. i want the same js to act on both of them but to not mix up any of the js -- i want them to act as if they're independent and separated, but i don't want to duplicate the jquery. help?
[13:40:02] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: keypress
[13:40:07] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: I want text to appear in the input box
[13:40:10] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: Hello again!
[13:40:11] <robertmaxrees> stef1a $("#form1, #form2')
[13:40:21] <stef1a> ManBearPixel: hey ManBearPixel :-)
[13:40:42] <ManBearPixel> Still working on that site? :p
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> ssut IN the input box?  or in the label?
[13:40:57] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: i don't understand. also, the jQuery i want to independently "replicate" is quite long.
[13:41:07] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: in the input box
[13:41:11] <robertmaxrees> stef1a without seeing what you're doing, it's hard to help you.
[13:41:15] <stef1a> ManBearPixel: yes indeed... should be done with the front end stuff (or at least the jquery) soon
[13:41:17] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: I wanna simulate typing in that input box
[13:41:28] <ManBearPixel> stef1a:
[13:41:38] <robertmaxrees> sssilver this is way off base then ;)
[13:41:43] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: Nooooooice, I’m wrapping up my site soon enough as well :D
[13:41:53] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: what's the way to do that?
[13:42:07] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: Had to work on some odd iOS issues this morning
[13:42:15] <robertmaxrees> if you want to put text into the input, do $('input').val('your value here')
[13:42:18] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: you got it...
[13:42:20] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're targeting the input.
[13:42:31] <stef1a> ManBearPixel: oh dear. iOS dev is always a mixed bag...
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> err, *label
[13:43:04] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: Well in general, it wasn’t anything crazy. I’ve been developing sites long enough now to avoid mistakes and/or develop in modules
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> stef1a if I were you, i'd start by decoupling my logic from my bindings.
[13:43:18] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: I'm just outputting the keypress code in the label
[13:43:48] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: These issues were new to me, for example.. A video playing and a modal pops up over it, iOS will detect any touches and the video will intercept the touches
[13:43:55] <ManBearPixel> Even if the z-index is greater than the video
[13:44:29] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: Another one was a scrolling issue where it seemed to lag when scrolling through a playlist of videos
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> sssilver so you want to enter text into an input.  you also want anything typed into the input to put text into a label?
[13:45:39] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: unsure what you mean by that
[13:45:43] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: also, http://jsfiddle.net/bfpnh5x8/1/
[13:46:17] <stef1a> ManBearPixel: ah, i see. well it's good that you've got the prerequisite experience
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> stef1a you mean the checkRadio() function?
[13:46:44] <ManBearPixel> stef1a: Are you working on the website as part of a school project?
[13:46:48] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: no, everything below that line
[13:47:14] <stef1a> ManBearPixel: it is a project for my school, but it isn't a class-assigned project
[13:47:47] <ManBearPixel> Neato, you better post your final version :p
[13:48:21] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: if i don't specify the class (what i tried to do with the klass var), then the jquery is fired when i use both forms... and the variables, etc. are the same. but i want them to be separate
[13:48:28] <stef1a> ManBearPixel: well, it'll be live in a few weeks :-)
[13:48:48] <bewl> Say i have an array [1,2,3,4] and another array [1,2,2,3,4,4]... whats a good method to detect if array1 contains all values from array2?
[13:49:10] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:49:32] <ManBearPixel> bewl: I would say $.InArray
[13:49:33] <robertmaxrees> stef1a i really wish I had time ot step through this and refactor it for you heh
[13:49:38] <bewl> i tried that
[13:49:59] <bewl> if(!.inArray(array1, array2) != 1)
[13:50:03] <bewl> err $.
[13:50:06] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: hey, no problem if you don't... i wasn't quite asking for that, and i really should be the one doing the work
[13:50:09] <dismist> if you ever step to this i'll refactor your face
[13:50:16] <ManBearPixel> bewl: Nah, sadly not that simple
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> stef1a the issue is that what you have now binds everything together for you.
[13:50:22] <bewl> thats what i figured
[13:50:30] <bewl> just foreach it?
[13:50:31] <ManBearPixel> bewl: What you would have to do is loop through your arr1
[13:50:35] <bewl> yea
[13:50:46] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: can you explain in general how i can decouple / unbind it so i can achieve the desired effect?
[13:50:48] <bewl> bah, i was hoping for some nice utility method
[13:50:52] <bewl> thans anyways
[13:51:08] <ManBearPixel> bewl: And run that function for each item, but the moment it is not in there exit the whole loop since there is no point continuing
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> stef1a do everything relative to the event that gets fired.
[13:51:13] <bewl> yea
[13:51:18] <bewl> i was trying to avoid that logic
[13:51:27] <bewl> but i guess there is nothing wrong with it either way
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> here's another way.
[13:51:44] <robertmaxrees> *there's
[13:51:58] <dmsuperman> bewl: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16227197/compute-intersection-of-two-arrays-in-javascript
[13:52:11] <ManBearPixel> bewl: Actually, if you use underscore.js
[13:52:11] <dmsuperman> intersect the two and compare the results length to the original length
[13:52:17] <dmsuperman> or diff if you can find a shorter diff method
[13:52:19] <bewl> we dont use that here
[13:52:38] <bewl> well the 2 arrays' lengths will be different
[13:52:49] <dmsuperman> that's fine
[13:52:55] <dmsuperman> here you go this is a very short diff: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1187518/javascript-array-difference
[13:53:07] <dmsuperman> if the resulting array length is 0, they are the same
[13:53:16] <bewl> var diff = $(old_array).not(new_array).get();
[13:53:18] <bewl> beauty.
[13:53:20] <robertmaxrees> i was about to suggest something similar.
[13:53:27] <robertmaxrees> the .every() method.
[13:53:33] <bewl> then just make sure diff.length == 0
[13:54:09] <robertmaxrees> or use a combo of .every() and forEach() :)
[13:54:09] <bewl> yea good find
[13:54:10] <bewl> thanks
[13:54:12] <dmsuperman> robertmaxrees: yeah but that would require running it multiple times right?
[13:54:12] <dmsuperman> yeah
[13:54:14] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: okay. how would i keep track of, for examle, rbDiv and i, which are used in multiple functions and are defined outside of them?
[13:54:43] <bewl> hmmm i like that array prototype method even better.
[13:54:55] <robertmaxrees> bewl just watch for old IE support.
[13:55:03] <bewl> we support 9+
[13:55:08] <dmsuperman> I think you're good then
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> then you should be fine.
[13:55:10] <bewl> yea
[13:55:19] <robertmaxrees> stef1a i closed the code, but the idea is you should write functions that you explicitly pass elements to.
[13:57:19] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: so there's no way to make the input behave like a key was actually pressed on it?
[13:57:35] <robertmaxrees> sssilver there are ways to do it, but what you really want to do is much simpler :)
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tfsma4tb/
[13:58:32] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[13:59:24] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: this is my big problem -- I use typeahead, and I want it to open the list of suggestions upon focus
[13:59:49] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: the only way to do that seems to trigger a keypress event on its input box by simulating a user pressing the down key
[14:00:18] <sssilver> robertmaxrees: so I'm trying to trigger a keypress with keycode 40 (which is the code for the down arrow key), but it doesn't seem to be doing anything
[14:00:25] <sssilver> so I'm pretty confused
[14:00:33] <robertmaxrees> you want .keyCode
[14:00:36] <robertmaxrees> not which
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3276794/jquery-or-pure-js-simulate-enter-key-pressed-for-testing
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> just change the keycode and you're good to go.
[14:01:56] <bewl> just fyi, went with this logic:
[14:01:58] <bewl> array1.filter(function (i) { return array2.indexOf(i) < 0; }).length == 0
[14:02:14] <sssilver> yeah robertmaxrees still doesn't work :(
[14:02:17] <sssilver> uh
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> bewl you don't need filter unless you actually need a new array.
[14:03:19] <bewl> i dont necessarily need a new array, just a boolean statement
[14:03:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then don't use filter.
[14:04:04] <AlexR2> hey folks, looks like http://dopey.twitter.biz/job/birdcage_queue/20848/console is stuck waiting for an executor
[14:04:09] <AlexR2> err
[14:04:23] <AlexR2> that does not go here
[14:04:27] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[14:04:41] <AlexR2> womp
[14:10:26] <uskerine> does this seem fine? switch($('#pageId').val())    where pageId is a hidden input item
[14:11:44] <AlexR2> nothing wrong with that uskerine
[14:11:55] <uskerine> ok thanks
[14:14:12] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:19:51] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon Azrael_-
[14:26:04] <goose00014000> Can anyone see why my simple line of jquery isnt working?
[14:26:05] <goose00014000> http://pastebin.com/YZLW40qd
[14:26:15] <goose00014000> $('ul.emphasis').find('li').style('color', 'green');
[14:26:31] <goose00014000> thats the jquery line but you can see all of the source on that pastebin link
[14:26:46] <AlexR2> not .style, do .css
[14:26:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:27:03] <goose00014000> ...ya im an idiot
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> also, don't do that in jquery ;)
[14:27:13] <goose00014000> that was right in front of me in the video lol
[14:27:20] <robertmaxrees> oh, a lesson.
[14:27:22] <goose00014000> i wouldnt im doing a tutorial
[14:27:58] <goose00014000> cool
[14:28:00] <goose00014000> thanks
[14:28:04] <goose00014000> its working now
[14:30:03] <Azrael_-> i want to intercept the submit-action in my form and provide different actions depending on the button clicked. how do i get the jquery-object of the clicked button in the function? $(e.currenttarget) didn't work. can you give me a small hint?
[14:31:09] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- document.activeElement.
[14:31:26] <robertmaxrees> or swap to preventing the default submit event and bind to the click events
[14:33:42] <Azrael_-> thanks. will go for document.activeElement for now. not too good with js/jquery yet and need a fast solution
[14:35:02] <robertmaxrees> eeeh...
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault() });
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> then do click handlers for the other ones.
[14:35:54] <Azrael_-> thanks :) activeElement already works. will keep the other option in mind
[14:36:21] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:36:36] <Azrael_-> normally you don't get that much spoonfeeding like you just did and without looking it up i wouldn't have been that fast.
[14:43:43] <fullhdpixel> Hello, I have a quick question: http://pastebin.com/S3z6N121
[14:47:12] <robertmaxrees> which styling?
[14:47:28] <fullhdpixel> background of the navbar
[14:47:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see more.
[14:47:38] <fullhdpixel> and alongside with some paddings
[14:47:39] <fullhdpixel> ok
[14:52:01] <fullhdpixel> robertmaxrees: something like this happens: http://jsfiddle.net/w0vk0a05/
[14:52:54] <robertmaxrees> add a width: 100%;
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> do #header.
[14:53:00] <robertmaxrees> good to go.
[14:53:08] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember the layout rules for fixed positioning
[14:54:49] <jword> hi guys , i have the following string  '@user1  sdfs  @user2 @user3' how to remove word from the end of word to the previous @ in jquery ?
[14:55:06] <fullhdpixel> yes, robermaxrees. The width helps with getting the padding right
[14:55:44] <robertmaxrees> jword you... don't?  use a regular expression.
[14:58:17] <hooligan321> http://imgur.com/txnhw8K
[15:02:01] <jword> im not good at it robertmaxrees :(
[15:02:23] <robertmaxrees> jword there are a few different ways to do it :)
[15:02:34] <robertmaxrees> you want to remove the last @ and everything after it, right?
[15:02:35] <robertmaxrees> ry
[15:02:35] <robertmaxrees> [2014:08:28:14:54:49] <jword> hi guys , i have the following string  '@
[15:02:38] <robertmaxrees> woops
[15:02:41] <jword> best one :)
[15:03:02] <robertmaxrees> dunno about "best" since i'm not sure about your use case.
[15:03:10] <robertmaxrees> but a string split would work well.
[15:04:14] <jword> u know how facebook and twitter when u mention someone   , if u backspace it will remove the all name
[15:04:22] <robertmaxrees> okay
[15:04:24] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[15:04:25] <jword> i want something same ..exactly same
[15:04:38] <jword> i have tried , but got little crazy
[15:04:40] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure I saw a library that does that sorta stuff recently.
[15:06:37] <jword> my problem is , lets say i have the following string '@test1 222 @test33 444 ' when i backspace when cursor at end of 4 ,it will remove to @test33
[15:07:15] <jword> robertmaxrees
[15:07:25] <robertmaxrees> jword you should look for a library that does this for you instead.
[15:07:51] <jword> im using mention.js pluin
[15:08:08] <jword> plugin , but this feature is missing , and i want to do it
[15:08:20] <robertmaxrees> heh, that's going to be a little more difficult than you bargained for.
[15:08:25] <jake-knor> what is wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/03qLjdq0/
[15:08:57] <robertmaxrees> jake-knor $("button").on("click", function(e){(
[15:09:12] <robertmaxrees> and subsequently )}
[15:09:20] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees: ?
[15:09:26] <robertmaxrees> $("button").on("click", function(e) { }); is what you want.
[15:09:41] <sanman> hi, I'm struggling with a div that has zero height, and I need to make it fill the parent's height
[15:10:14] <robertmaxrees> jake-knor you're passing a function as a parameter to on - .on() looks like this with no args: $("button").on();
[15:10:39] <robertmaxrees> if you want to pass an anonymous function, you have $("button").on(function(e) { });
[15:10:42] <robertmaxrees> see the difference?
[15:10:43] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees: still doesnt work
[15:11:11] <jword> :(
[15:11:14] <jword> robertmaxrees
[15:11:22] <robertmaxrees> jword sorry mano.
[15:11:31] <jword> ok :(
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> jake-knor you can't append to inputs/.
[15:11:53] <robertmaxrees> do you want to set the value of them?
[15:12:25] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees:  i just need to insert a span after each input with invalid
[15:12:48] <jake-knor> i tried after
[15:13:45] <robertmaxrees> jake-knor http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/03qLjdq0/1/
[15:14:19] <robertmaxrees> after was what you wanted.
[15:14:29] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees: one question.. how can i avoid inserting invalid messages after the first click
[15:15:03] <robertmaxrees> couple different ways.  if you want to just remove the event binding altogether, use .one(), but something tells me you'll re-check at some point, yeah?
[15:15:35] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees:  right
[15:16:29] <robertmaxrees> the smarter way™ to do this would be to enumerate over your inputs, check their .val(), and if it doesn't meet your criteria, insert your new element
[15:17:36] <jake-knor> i see
[15:18:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/03qLjdq0/2/
[15:19:15] <robertmaxrees> also, generally you put the preventDefault() at the top of your callback.
[15:23:43] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees: the idea is to map the json error im getting with each field and show the error
[15:26:39] <robertmaxrees> jake-knor that's why you key off the name like that :)
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> like I just showed you ;)
[15:28:10] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees:  but it keeps inserting invalid.. should i enumarte over inputs?
[15:28:29] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what mine is doing...
[15:28:36] <robertmaxrees> i can show you the next step if you want :)
[15:29:39] <robertmaxrees> the dirty way is to just put $('input').next('span').remove(); after your preventDefault
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/03qLjdq0/4/
[15:29:46] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[15:29:51] <Phaoris_> hi all
[15:30:12] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees:  and the cleanest?
[15:33:58] <robertmaxrees> use riot or backbone or something similar ;)
[15:36:08] <jake-knor> robertmaxrees:  thanks!
[15:37:53] <jword> ok , if i have @test1 222 @tes333 44 , if cursor someone , how can i substring from the cursor till previous @ , if cusrsor at 4 , how can i get '@test333 44' ?
[15:38:03] <jword> robertmaxrees:
[15:38:08] <robertmaxrees> jword you'll want to google around for that one.
[15:38:17] <jword> :(
[15:38:24] <jword> what i type in google ?
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> javascript get cursor position in text field
[15:38:53] <robertmaxrees> or something like that.,
[15:38:55] <robertmaxrees> idk
[15:39:54] <jword> hmmmm
[15:42:39] <Phaoris_> can someone help plz, i'm using jquery datatables and cannot fix the default sorting, i need to sort the date using DESC order, here is my test case : http://live.datatables.net/xapefudo/1/edit
[15:42:58] <robertmaxrees> Phaoris_ you're much more likely to get help on their forums btw.
[15:43:16] <Phaoris_> ok robertmaxrees,
[15:44:12] <Phaoris_> i think the issue is with moment.js format, i think datatables does not like it since the order works just fine without the formatting, but i need to format the date to the european format
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> lol so neither problem is with jquery ;)
[15:46:36] <Phaoris_> yeah :)
[15:59:54] <tambien> what is causing this search bar to open lo the right instead of the left? http://jsfiddle.net/mackry/vBxqC/
[16:01:33] <unclemantis> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ce1231b243a74c44ccb6
[16:02:17] <robertmaxrees> unclemantis use .val().
[16:02:19] <unclemantis> my question is on line 6. the id:id part. I want to send the id of year so i tried id:year but the browser then freezes and i have to close it. What am I doing wrong?
[16:02:44] <robertmaxrees> "the ID of the year" ?
[16:02:56] <unclemantis> the id is the name year
[16:03:07] <unclemantis>       <select id="year">
[16:03:17] <robertmaxrees> $(this).prop('id') will get you that.
[16:03:36] <robertmaxrees> btw $("select#year") is kind of slow.
[16:03:40] <unclemantis> do i type that in replacement of id:id
[16:04:43] <robertmaxrees> {id:$(this).prop('id')}
[16:06:48] <robertmaxrees> tambien you'll probably have more luck in #css
[16:07:22] <unclemantis> robertmaxrees that is passing id:year not the value
[16:08:10] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted the ID >.>
[16:08:27] <robertmaxrees> if you want the value of an input, use .val
[16:08:36] <unclemantis> this is what I WANT to happen. I want the post to look like year:2015
[16:09:00] <robertmaxrees> var id = $("#year").val();
[16:09:01] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[16:11:17] <unclemantis> robertmaxrees. This is what is going on and this is what I want to happen. The way it stands as (id:id) when the form is posted the following is being sent to the script id:2015
[16:11:29] <unclemantis> i want that to be year:2015
[16:12:03] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want to dynamically set the name "id", as well as the value?
[16:12:38] <unclemantis> in my php script i am looking for $_POST[year] and that will contain the value of the option from the form
[16:13:14] <robertmaxrees> then do {year:id}
[16:13:42] <robertmaxrees> unless you want to be able to dynamically change that "year" value to be the ID of the current select.
[16:14:20] <unclemantis> i could have sworn i did that
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:14:33] <unclemantis> year:2015
[16:14:47] <robertmaxrees> {id: id} will create a propery name "id" with a value set to whatever the id var has.
[16:16:44] <unclemantis> and YES it works
[16:16:56] <unclemantis> i really could have sworn i tried year:id.
[16:17:24] <unclemantis> robertmaxrees thank you very much for the assistance... I now understand how this work
[16:17:26] <unclemantis> s
[16:17:29] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:26:05] <unclemantis> robertmaxrees me again
[16:26:06] <unclemantis>  	      $.post("select_model.php", {year:year,make:make}, function(data){
[16:26:34] <unclemantis> i have set year and set make variables, but only year is getting passed not make
[16:27:00] <robertmaxrees> build up your object outside of the post.
[16:27:09] <robertmaxrees> var myObject = {};  then pass myObject.
[16:27:19] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you're clearing your cache
[16:30:04] <unclemantis>  	      var post = {year:year,make:make}
[16:30:26] <unclemantis> is this correct? am i seperating my variables properly with the comma?

[16:34:11] <unclemantis> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f7d47a979a4f33709361
[16:34:34] <robertmaxrees> just use the second one.
[16:34:34] <unclemantis> only year:2015 is passing, not make:kia
[16:34:44] <robertmaxrees> and .val(), never .attr('value')
[16:34:53] <robertmaxrees> get the value of the form control.
[16:34:59] <robertmaxrees> don't look for the selected element.
[16:35:18] <BillCriswell> $('#year').val() is plenty.
[16:35:23] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:35:42] <robertmaxrees> i pointed this out earlier.

[16:38:16] <unclemantis> the second method is still only passing year:2015
[16:38:33] <unclemantis> yes the first one works. the second one is not
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[16:39:09] <unclemantis> none
[16:39:27] <robertmaxrees> no clue, then.

[16:39:44] <robertmaxrees> in the middle of something.  if you shoot it out somebody might be able to help.
[16:40:02] <unclemantis> ok. thank you for the help :-D
[16:41:35] <BillCriswell> unclemantis: You have two listeners on change for year. Doesn't seem deliberate.
[16:42:10] <unclemantis> i saw that
[16:42:30] <unclemantis> i got it half working now
[16:42:48] <BillCriswell> unclemantis: Sweet.
[16:43:46] <unclemantis> kick ass it works!!!
[16:46:08] <BillCriswell> Sweeeet
[16:47:25] <unclemantis> now now have a chain of 4 selects that work right after the other now! awesome!

[17:43:55] <samuel_> how do I reset select options after I've poplated the select with values?

[17:46:00] <samuel_> no I mean I"m pulling in all new vales and I want to clear the existing ones robertmaxrees
[17:49:10] <samuel_> any ideas robertmaxrees ?

[17:50:52] <samuel_> i just want to reset the select to nothing then pull in json
[17:51:11] <robertmaxrees> samuel_ because I don't understand what you mean by "reset the select" - you could delete the options.
[17:51:21] <robertmaxrees> and then rebuild them.
[17:51:23] <guzzlefry> I'm setting the src property on images via an AJAX call but don't have a reliable way of checking that the image actually exists.
[17:51:28] <samuel_> I want to delete all the options and then load new ones robertmaxrees
[17:51:35] <robertmaxrees> samuel_ then delete them?
[17:51:40] <samuel_> how?
[17:51:51] <robertmaxrees> samuel_ $('option select').remove();
[17:52:04] <samuel_> that will remove all of them?
[17:52:15] <robertmaxrees> all select elements under options, yes.
[17:52:39] <robertmaxrees> guzzlefry did you do a google search?
[17:54:26] <guzzlefry> yes, just now >_>
[17:54:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:54:45] <guzzlefry> first time I used really bad keywords
[17:55:01] <guzzlefry> So, .onerror() :)
[17:55:07] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, yeah.
[18:08:35] <guzzlefry> well, this isn't working: $(document).on('error', '.userPopupMenu .userImage', function() { ... });
[18:37:55] <guzzlefry> Any suggestions?
[18:54:32] <guzzlefry> okay, so that doesn't seem to be binding the event.
