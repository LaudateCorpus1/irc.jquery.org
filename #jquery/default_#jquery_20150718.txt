[06:01:49] <Carina> Hello, how I can refresh div content using some file?
[06:34:03] <jquickq2442> Quick question froma novice, with hopefully a quick answer, please. I am using the sticky.js script (https://github.com/garand/sticky) When I call a sticky $("#sticker").sticky({topSpacing:0}); I am not clear on when I am able to implement the unstick call: $("#sticker").unstick();
[07:10:20] <Kamuela> not understanding the alpha 3.0 changes to hide and show, are they just saying display: none on an element will result on neither hide nor show making any changes?
[07:16:27] <anom> http://jsfiddle.net/qqx4d8t1/ how can I fix these jshint errors?
[07:16:31] <chey_> anybody here?
[07:20:00] <cannap> hi
[07:20:13] <arthurvr> hey there
[07:20:45] <arthurvr> anom: Just donâ€™t do such string magic :p
[07:20:48] <arthurvr> let me show ya
[07:21:27] <anom> hmmph
[07:22:04] <arthurvr> anom: http://jsfiddle.net/qqx4d8t1/1/ like this, or just use the + operator
[07:22:17] <chey_> i was wonder if i could limit the amount of json arrays loaded at a time and then give a user a option to press load more to get more json arrays from my RESTful api
[07:23:05] <shoky_> Kamuela: if the display:none is set from a stylesheet, then yeah hide or show won't do anything
[07:25:17] <chey_> was that answer for me?
[07:25:31] <anom> thanks arthurvr
[09:34:21] <Kamuela> shoky_, so they want jquery to handle these "states" itself then, meaning that you shouldn't think of this as breaking functionality, but asking you to have jquery work with jquery and not make jquery/css code
[09:38:28] <ughzp> am I the only one who wants new yayQuery episodes?
[09:44:59] <shoky_> Kamuela: something like that, i guess
[09:45:25] <shoky_> ughzp_: nope ;p
[10:10:48] <ganeshaditya1> Hey guys.. Any idea why this is not woking? $('body').css('background-image', 'url("/static/images/stock/0.jpg")');
[10:11:04] <ganeshaditya1> I also tried $('body').css('background', 'url("/static/images/stock/0.jpg")'); even that doesn't work
[10:11:21] <arthurvr> ganeshaditya1: does that image file exist? Anything in the console? Executing on document ready?
[10:12:44] <ganeshaditya1> @arthurvr forgot to run it on document ready! Thanks man.
[10:12:58] <arthurvr> ganeshaditya1: yw :)
[10:13:43] <ganeshaditya1> hey how can I do this with a fade effect?
[10:22:14] <ganeshaditya1> Hey does the animate function in jquery not support "background-image" ??
[10:25:48] <Whirled> What are you trying to do? ganeshaditya1
[10:30:43] <ganeshaditya1> @Whirled I am trying to change the background of my page periodically through a bunch of stock photographs
[10:31:53] <Whirled> so how do you suggest that animate will help with that?
[10:32:14] <Whirled> if you want to fade the background image, that's opacity you would animate
[10:32:41] <Whirled> if you want to scoot it off the page and scoot the next one on, that can be done a number of ways.
[10:33:29] <Whirled> Regardless, you should be using CSS to animate your backgrounds then you can swap classes using Jquery to swap bgs
[10:33:47] <ganeshaditya1> @Whirled I really have no idea why I was trying animate. I have never done effects in Jquery before. I am trying to fade out the previous image and fade in the next one.
[10:34:11] <Whirled> so you don't need the background-image attribute (except in callback)
[10:34:12] <ganeshaditya1> which css properities should I check out
[10:35:16] <Whirled> You could set two block level elements at different z-indexes and then setup animation transitions for in and out. I'll find a link for ya
[10:36:46] <Whirled> https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/
[10:36:47] <ganeshaditya1> @Whirled wild idea, what if I use a DIV to cover up the whole space? and tweak the opacity of the div ?
[10:37:19] <Whirled> sure. that's a way to do it. Then you can swap between one and the other...preloading the image into the invisible div
[10:38:23] <ganeshaditya1> I guess I will do it that way cause, with css I have to learn a lot of things.
[10:38:45] <Whirled> Not really. It's faster and easier with CSS...I'll make a quick fiddle for you.
[10:39:56] <Whirled> https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/
[10:40:30] <sash_> They don't even need different z-indexes
[10:41:06] <sash_> position: absolute with a position: relative container, same position, transition opacity
[10:50:02] <sash_> ganeshaditya1: https://jsfiddle.net/6zycesy8/
[10:51:12] <Whirled> :first-of-type, wow. never heard of that
[10:52:40] <sash_> Can only access types, not classes, unfortunately
[10:52:56] <sash_> so p:first-of-type works, but not .foo:first-of-type
[10:53:12] <sash_> Sadly.
[10:53:49] <ganeshaditya1> I can't even make sense of a single link in that fiddle man :P It's like I am reading a program written in a functional language or something!
[10:54:21] <ganeshaditya1> Ohh boy... Have to learn a lot of stuff!
[10:55:39] <sash_> It's easy
[10:56:00] <sash_> The wrapper is just something around it, just has to be positioned relative, rest doesn't matter
[10:56:12] <sash_> The imgs are positioned on the same position.
[10:56:40] <sash_> They are "invisible" by setting opacity: 0;
[10:57:14] <sash_> The first one is visible, because it has opacity 1. When you hover the wrapper, the first one gets opacity 0, the second gets opacity 1.
[10:57:45] <sash_> And because we set transition: all 2s ease; that means, all effect changes are done with a slow transition effect.
[10:57:48] <sash_> That's it.
[10:58:48] <sash_> Well, and css-specifity: The more specific you are, the more the rule "counts". Specificy of #wrapper img:first-of-type is greater than #wrapper img
[10:59:24] <ganeshaditya1> I get the opacity part, I never learnt css3. so I am sort of confused.. what is with this webkit and moz and o stuff? I am really a newbie when it comes to programming.
[10:59:48] <sash_> That are just annoying browser-prefixes
[11:00:04] <sash_> You need them for some stuff, because browser vendors are assholes, basically.
[11:00:19] <ganeshaditya1> Hahah :D I didn't know we can swear in IRCs :D
[11:00:27] <sash_> If you look at it, all of them say the same thing.
[11:00:47] <sash_> When you use SASS, you can install a plugin that sets them automatically when needed.
[11:01:10] <ganeshaditya1> SASS and LESS are those sort of higher level CSS things right?
[11:01:17] <sash_> yep
[11:01:22] <sash_> They make life easier.
[11:02:08] <ganeshaditya1> Okay! Hey I have the whole weekend to myself. umm.. Should I invest it on learning (SASS or LESS) or CSS3 I will buy a ebook and binge read!
[11:02:17] <Whirled> here's how to add a class using jquery and css
[11:02:18] <Whirled> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6zycesy8/6/
[11:02:45] <Whirled> but it doesn't have to be done on click...it could be done whenever..
[11:03:40] <Whirled> a book? what's that?
[11:03:51] <sash_> ganeshaditya1: I like codecademy.
[11:03:59] <Whirled> me too
[11:04:37] <sash_> ganeshaditya1: You could learn the css/html basics there and switch over to jquery afterwards
[11:04:44] <ganeshaditya1> OHHOOO !! I get it what you have done @sash_ thanks to whirled fiddle. I could use a settimeout function to periodically add those classes to the div that will take up the whole background space.
[11:05:06] <Whirled> yup
[11:05:37] <ganeshaditya1> codeacademy is as thorough as a book?
[11:05:49] <Whirled> it's hands on
[11:06:06] <Whirled> much better than theoretical knowledge you might glean from a dead tree
[11:07:15] <ganeshaditya1> Haha :D dead tree :P
[11:12:22] <d3m0n> Anyone know how I can get this to mask pattern like so: $15.95 and $159.95 - http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/ ?
[11:12:46] <d3m0n> their money example is confusing
[11:14:26] <Whirled> What are you trying to do?
[11:14:48] <d3m0n> Mask input pricing in the 10's and 100's.
[11:15:09] <d3m0n> eg. $29.95 or $449.95
[11:15:43] <d3m0n> so when a user enter 2995 it adds the decimal and dollar sign
[11:15:59] <d3m0n> or 44995 it formats properly
[11:16:09] <Whirled> I'd just use strings to add a decimal to the string
[11:16:16] <arc_> this thing actually doesn't work in chrome it seems
[11:16:35] <d3m0n> Does for me
[11:16:42] <d3m0n> Whirled: how do you mean?
[11:16:54] <arc_> try the phone number with area code one, or 5-4 zip code
[11:17:23] <d3m0n> arc_: Did. It works for me
[11:17:54] <arc_> ok. for me on zip code it prevents me from entering characters after 5-3
[11:18:06] <arc_> and on phone number it does (##) ####-####
[11:22:28] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/zh4h4z8b/3/   I'd do something stupid like this
[11:23:54] <d3m0n> So stupid meaning.. don't do it? lol
[11:24:15] <Whirled> Doesn't handle lots of stuff
[11:24:18] <Whirled> like $
[11:24:43] <Whirled> or letters just return NaN...There are so many things to consider when checking numeric values like that.
[11:25:17] <d3m0n> Thats why I went with a plugin
[11:26:00] <Whirled> yup
[11:27:46] <Whirled> why does split().join() add a "," to the joined string?
[11:39:50] <Whirled> this is a little better, still not perfect, though: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/zh4h4z8b/10/
[12:01:00] <aphprentice> i need this tested on a website other than mine to see if it works right https://github.com/atechapart/responsive-slide-out any feedback is appreciated
[12:09:02] <mooru> Hello. i have an ajax link on a site to subscribe and unsubscribe for a content. i also have ::before and ::after in my html. when i click on the ajax link it fires up the ::before and ::after in my css multiple times. how can i stop it
[12:13:04] <aphprentice> mooru depends where its being called in your code, or you you may have another call being made somewhere else in your code
[12:15:30] <mooru> aphprentice hmm
[13:21:40] <ashgotti> Hello everyone I need a bit of help with delegation. I have a jquery event that is watching a field that doesn't work if the form doesn't validate: click submit, form says that I need to complete field A, B, C first but now my jquery doesn't work.http://pastebin.com/LmizN04R
[13:23:55] <ashgotti> The code works if the form is valid though
[13:25:04] <ashgotti> actually it does work, hmmm gotta find where it breaks
[13:25:18] <ashgotti> *it = the code I have within that function
[13:28:17] <ashgotti> Found the issue: if the form doesn't validate, the selector I use in my event changes..odd
[13:52:31] <GeO`> hey guys
[13:52:44] <GeO`> I have an issue with jquery-ui autocomplete widget
[13:53:25] <GeO`> I want that when the user first clicks on the input, a list of items is displayed as a "select", but they're totally not related to the normal behavior of the widget
[13:53:40] <GeO`> and then when they start typing, the normal behavior is in place
[13:55:17] <GeO`> a bit like the behavior of tripadvisor, their search field
[14:20:20] <shoky_> GeO`: here's one way, a bit hacky. there's probably a nicer way  http://jsfiddle.net/1qbf12u1/
[14:20:33] <hackal> Hello, when including jquery plugin is the order of js files in dom important?
[14:21:19] <hackal> meaning, if I could include the plugin before jquery
[14:21:30] <silverdust> hackal: yes. You can't call a plugin before jquery
[14:21:54] <silverdust> It wouldn't work and raise errors if you have it before jQuery as far as it is jQuery dependent
[15:00:40] <GeO`> shoky_: looks good :) thanks
[16:45:02] <JZA> hi is there a way that I can arrange tables from different sizes in a larger fixed container. I have a webservice with data from different routes to be displayed on a large LCD, but being a TV is af ixed size of 1300px height.
[16:47:28] <JZA> What I want is to replace or hide the tables that causes the DIV to overrlay the container.
[16:47:39] <JZA> *overflow
[16:48:52] <JZA> I dont have a way to know how many rows will the tables have so I would need to have something of like a "While DIV not overflow, print table from the array else skip'
[17:38:37] <_blizzy_> could anyone help me why ajax:success isn't triggering, even though the status code is returning 200? I'm using rails. https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/374c2552fa2fcec27d00
[17:56:34] <ganeshaditya1> hey what does document.cookie return when no cookie is set? undefined?
[20:08:18] <cronoz> hey everyone. ive been thinking about this for a few hours but cant seem to conceptulize the code required after reading the docs. whats the best way to perform a boolean (true/false) evaluation based on a class selector. Ex: https://goo.gl/xESqza the code uses Bootstrap Validator, so effectively what I'm doing is based on realtime input in the field, I'm validating it's authenticity before
[20:08:18] <cronoz> removing the readonly property from the next form input. I'm only testing with two fields for now before broadening it to use the entire form
[20:25:34] <Whirled> cronoz, if the fields are text fields, you can capture each keypress and evaluate the item
[20:26:48] <Whirled> cronoz, if you just want to validate a field before moving on, capture the "change" event
[20:26:53] <cronoz> i know i can use .keyup() but im leery to do so, as pre-filled text fields wont satisfy the validation of input
[20:27:21] <Whirled> why is that?
[20:27:22] <cronoz> can i pm you a (private) url?
[20:27:27] <Whirled> sure
[20:44:22] <Whirled> how do you get the order of inputs in a form?
[20:46:48] <cronoz> i imagine $('#formid input') would return an array of all the input types in order they appear in the DOM
[20:49:28] <Whirled> how do you get the next input in the jq object  var lst= $("input");  var fld=lst.eq(4).next()
[20:59:04] <Whirled> does .index return an integer?
[21:35:13] <cronoz> .next() will find the next immediate child element i believe
[21:35:27] <cronoz> you can filter it using a class identifier
[21:35:43] <cronoz> $('input').next('.someclass');
[21:36:30] <cronoz> and $('input').serialize() will take whats in the field and put it into a string
[22:09:37] <BytesAndCoffee> Why is jquery only returning the first element when I do a class selector
[22:10:08] <Whirled> You tell me how long a piece of string is and I will answer your question.
[22:11:00] <Whirled> The reason I say that is that you don't know anything about this piece of string, so it's hard to answer.
[22:11:16] <Whirled> Just like we have no way of knowing without an example or more data
[22:11:30] <BytesAndCoffee> Adding to github
[22:11:48] <BytesAndCoffee> ...and webstorm is frozen
[22:11:58] <Whirled> rockin' You might want to setup a running testcase as codepen or jsfiddle.
[22:16:01] <BytesAndCoffee> https://github.com/BytesAndCoffee/DOMinator-Android/tree/master/www
[22:16:15] <BytesAndCoffee> Whirled: ^
[22:17:18] <Whirled> gimme just a minute...
[22:19:17] <Whirled> cronoz, here's a hacky way to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4n3zLkhw/26/
[22:19:49] <Whirled> BytesAndCoffee, what selector are you using?
[22:19:56] <BytesAndCoffee> In the chrome debug console, I try to get all 5 .control elements and it only returns the one with ID up
[22:20:07] <BytesAndCoffee> $('.control')
[22:20:40] <BytesAndCoffee> This is going to be an app built with Cordova
[22:21:28] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5hzwzxfy/
[22:21:43] <Whirled> this shows that jquery is working. Notice it says 5 in the console.
[22:22:23] <Whirled> how are you using the selector?
[22:22:37] <Whirled> because some jquery methods only work on the first element.
[22:22:56] <BytesAndCoffee> Chrome dev console
[22:23:00] <BytesAndCoffee> $('.control')
[22:23:08] <Whirled> the dev console isn't live
[22:23:51] <BytesAndCoffee> ?
[22:25:28] <Whirled> in the dev console on chrome, type console.log($(".control").length);
[22:26:08] <Whirled> once you have your controls in a jquery object, what do you do with them next?
[22:26:27] <Whirled> $(".control").text() will only work on the first element, for example
[22:26:53] <BytesAndCoffee> Whirled: add on an onClick event
[22:27:00] <BytesAndCoffee> To each of them
[22:27:21] <Whirled> Better yet, handle the onclick event for all of them on a shared parent.
[22:27:33] <Whirled> one handler is almost always better than 5
[22:28:40] <BytesAndCoffee> The onClick changes the text in thr div with ID "dir" to the button's ID
[22:28:55] <BytesAndCoffee> or it will, at least
[22:29:12] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5hzwzxfy/1/
[22:30:01] <Whirled> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5hzwzxfy/2/
[22:30:12] <Whirled> changes the text like you said...one handler to rule them all
[22:30:49] <BytesAndCoffee> Now to get index.js to run /after/ jquery loads
[22:31:54] <Whirled> you will need a wrapper for all your jquery stuff. $(function () {   code here });
[22:32:10] <BytesAndCoffee> Ah
[22:32:50] <Whirled> that just ensures that the code inside only runs after the dom is loaded. Otherwise, it would be trying to select things that hadn't been added yet.
[22:34:10] <BytesAndCoffee> Uncaught referenceerror: $ is not defined
[22:35:12] <BytesAndCoffee> Do I have the jquery include in the wrong place?
[22:35:16] <Whirled> $(document).ready(function () { code here });
[22:35:43] <Whirled> That's the old, but valid way. There's a shorter syntax, but I always get it wrong.
[22:36:43] <BytesAndCoffee> Still getting undefined
[22:37:02] <Whirled> must not be loading jquery...
[22:37:04] <Whirled> https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/05/22/function%E2%80%A6-vs-function%E2%80%A6-or-domready-vs-the-module-pattern/
[22:38:01] <BytesAndCoffee> Oh
[22:38:17] <BytesAndCoffee> There's an error blocking jquery from loading
[22:39:30] <BytesAndCoffee> js/jquery/jquery.js:118
[22:40:27] <Whirled> guarantee its not an error in jquery.
[22:40:43] <BytesAndCoffee> Cannot read property 'event' of undefined
[22:41:00] <Whirled> because jquery is undefined if its not loading
[22:41:21] <BytesAndCoffee> special = $.event.special,
[22:42:28] <BytesAndCoffee> So?
[22:42:51] <Whirled> $ is jquery. If $ is not loaded, then it means nothing
[22:43:03] <BytesAndCoffee> I know that
[22:43:16] <BytesAndCoffee> How do I fix the error I just outlined
[22:44:25] <Whirled> load jquery...make sure that it is loaded...that's the only way.
[22:44:43] <Whirled> $.anything will be undefined
[22:44:56] <Whirled> maybe lookup noConflict mode for jquery.
[22:45:01] <BytesAndCoffee> It's not loading due to an error in jquery.js
[22:45:11] <BytesAndCoffee> Idk how
[22:45:26] <BytesAndCoffee> I got the dist from the dist builder
[22:45:49] <Whirled> there's something else going on. Do you have a link to the page you could pm me?
[22:46:13] <BytesAndCoffee> Link?
[22:46:15] <Whirled> what is index.js?
[22:46:33] <BytesAndCoffee> Look in js/jquery/jquery.js
[22:46:56] <BytesAndCoffee> index.js is the pages main js
[22:48:04] <vkrishn> hi
[22:48:34] <vkrishn> is there an offline version of api.jquery.com ?
[22:48:45] <vkrishn> pdf, zip(html)
[23:09:01] <vkrishn> ok, found some cheatsheets
