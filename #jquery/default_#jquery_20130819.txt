[00:15:55] <bobsermon> Hii all, i'm having an issue with some jquery and css. Im append a div to my body and there is an animation on but when i click the close button and press the popup again he doenst do the animation. Is it css-wise or is this on my jQuery?
[00:21:40] <xec> bobsermon: could be either. do you have a live url?
[00:22:58] <bobsermon> @xec give me 2 sec
[00:27:31] <Tee_Pee> 'ello
[00:28:18] <Tee_Pee> Quick question - I have an input form, and I require a special behavior for one of the input fields, namely
[00:29:09] <Tee_Pee> $("#coepldetailsform #plstags").parent().on("click", function() { ..... })
[00:29:19] <bobsermon> xec: http://sermonbob.be/test/ here you go, when you click on a project the header should do the animation once but when you close and open one again it doesn't
[00:29:35] <Tee_Pee> The problem with this is that it attaches that same click handler on every single input's parent div
[00:29:47] <Cork> Tee_Pee: no need to have id in id, the last id has to be uniq, so the first id in there is pointless
[00:29:53] <Tee_Pee> despite that .parent() call only returning one (the correct) parent
[00:30:09] <Cork> Tee_Pee: no parent() can't only return one
[00:30:23] <Cork> Tee_Pee: it will return the parent for each element in the original set
[00:30:24] <xec> s/'t//
[00:30:38] <xec> Cork: you're confusing it with .parents() ?
[00:30:46] <xec> no wait
[00:30:47] <xec> nevermind
[00:30:50] <Cork> :)
[00:31:02] * xec sits in the shame corner
[00:31:11] <Cork> Tee_Pee: though your original set can only match one element
[00:31:42] <Tee_Pee> hence my point
[00:31:49] <Tee_Pee> I fire it in the js console
[00:31:55] <Tee_Pee> and it only returns one parent
[00:31:57] <Cork> ?p
[00:32:01] <xec> afk 30 min
[00:32:05] <Tee_Pee> 1 sec
[00:32:08] <Cork> sigh /me kicks the bots around a min
[00:32:18] <grafi> dont break em!
[00:32:19] <Cork> * for a min
[00:32:46] <Tee_Pee> http://imgur.com/g8FLqn2
[00:33:01] <Cork> hmm
[00:33:02] <grafi> i was really hoping for a cat picture
[00:33:03] <Cork> no not images
[00:33:17] <Cork> Tee_Pee: make a code example in jsfiddle.net
[00:33:29] <Cork> a working one where the event handler you have problem with triggers
[00:33:38] <bobsermon> xec: i tested it insafarie and there he does always the animation, isn't chrome the same as safari??
[00:34:09] <grafi> not anymore <:
[00:34:38] <Cork> bobsermon: it's basically is, but they have local patches
[00:34:49] <Cork> bobsermon: and they are moving over to blink (a webkit clone)
[00:34:59] <grafi> havent they already?
[00:35:05] <grafi> not that anything much is different
[00:35:06] <grafi> ^^
[00:35:14] <Cork> grafi: don't think it's in the release browser yet
[00:35:23] <grafi> hm
[00:35:29] <grafi> too lazy to check
[00:35:38] <grafi> but the announcement feels like months ago
[00:35:40] <Cork> grafi: though it doesn't matter, it is basically the same as there old patch set for the moment
[00:35:43] <bobsermon> That sucks :s how can i figure out why my effect doesn't work :(
[00:35:56] <grafi> Cork: thats what im saying :P
[00:36:03] <grafi> [09:35:04] <grafi> not that anything much is different
[00:36:12] <Cork> grafi: it hasn't deviated much from webkit yet, but they are planing to
[00:36:30] <grafi> it can only get bettererer
[00:36:44] <Cork> bobsermon: what effect are you having problems with?
[00:37:58] <Tee_Pee> well, fuck me, when I copy over the code snippets to jsfiddler it works properly
[00:38:07] <Tee_Pee> But then again, this is jquery mobile I use on my end
[00:38:08] <grafi> hahaha
[00:38:10] <Tee_Pee> might be the cause
[00:38:18] <Cork> ya, it might be
[00:38:32] <Cork> they are doing a lot of messed up things with the event system
[00:38:33] <bobsermon> Cork: http://sermonbob.be/test/ here you go, when you click on a project the header should do the animation once but when you close and open one again it doesn't (only in Chrome, in safari it works)
[00:39:13] <grafi> hi bob
[00:39:13] <Cork> bobsermon: where is the code for it?
[00:41:59] <Cork> bobsermon: also do you mean the home | about | work | contact section?
[00:41:59] <grafi> seems to animate fine
[00:42:08] <Cork> ya, if you are it works just fine here
[00:42:27] <Cork> (also note chrome is just a theme if you run it on mac)
[00:42:34] <grafi> i think he means work -> click on a macbook
[00:42:35] <Cork> chrome IS safari there
[00:42:43] <bobsermon> yes
[00:42:54] <grafi> but its working fine for me :P
[00:42:57] <bobsermon> the animation on the header works in chrome only once and in safari all the time
[00:43:06] <bobsermon> the slide down animation?
[00:43:14] <Cork> bobsermon: works every time i click it here
[00:43:20] <Cork> ya
[00:43:31] <grafi> every animation i could find
[00:43:48] <bobsermon> Cork: how is that possible. I'm running the latest Chrome ...
[00:44:05] <Cork> bobsermon: i don't think the browser is the problem here
[00:44:29] <Cork> bobsermon: have a look in ctrl+shift+j
[00:44:35] <Cork> so you don't get any errors there
[00:45:20] <Cork> and i'm on linux so i can't test safari chrome
[00:47:25] <bobsermon> Cork: a question when you click the laptop the panel is coming up. but does the grey header animates in?
[00:47:50] <Cork> ya
[00:49:22] <Cork> i really don't get why anyone use chrome on osx
[00:50:00] <boytoy> Cork: whys dat?
[00:50:21] <Cork> well you get safari, but with a slower js engine
[00:50:23] <Cork> and a new theme
[00:50:34] <boytoy> oh :)
[00:50:36] <Cork> i don't see the point
[00:51:05] <Cork> apple has forbidden anyone from making a browser for the osx that can beat there browser
[00:51:05] <boytoy> i guess it dont matter to the layman
[00:51:09] <bobsermon> Thats true, but i should test it in all browsers he ^^ strange i tested on different machines and still the animations doenst trigger :D
[00:51:18] <boytoy> i see
[00:51:35] <Cork> and that is why you don't see opera or firefox on that os
[00:51:57] <Cork> (cause they would have to migrate to webkit + apples old slow js engine to be allowed in)
[00:52:14] <Cork> nitro is safari only
[00:52:23] <Tee_Pee> Oh fuck, I think I know what the error is here... when I'm in the console, parent() returns the correct parent, but that does not happen at the time the method is run, i.e. before jquery generates all of its wrapper divs
[00:52:25] <Tee_Pee> D'OH
[00:52:42] <Cork> heh
[00:52:50] <Cork> so a classical race :)
[00:58:20] <Tee_Pee> unsurprisingly, setting the onclick event to the parent after pageinit works like a charm.
[01:09:08] <jquery_ask> hey a question do somebody know how i can invalidate teh $(document).ready() after it is called, because i postload ontother side and inject this site into the acutuell site and so i want that this postloaded content and its own $(documet).ready() is then called if all scripts, which are defined in this postloaded content are successfull loaded
[01:09:42] <Cork> jquery_ask: use a named function and call it manually
[01:09:58] <Cork> jquery_ask: ready is for when the browser has created the dom for the page
[01:10:10] <Cork> it is not for any other forms of load triggering
[01:10:11] <jquery_ask> cork the problem is this postloaded content i cant change it
[01:10:21] <jquery_ask> it is fixed
[01:10:29] <jquery_ask> and it has it owns ready functions
[01:11:05] <jquery_ask> it is a complete site with it owns <html></html> and so on
[01:11:24] <jquery_ask> i append this content at the end of <body> in the actuall content
[01:11:43] <jquery_ask> thats not good design but i have to do it so
[01:12:47] <Cork> jquery_ask: you could try $(document).trigger('ready') but i don't think that will work
[01:13:11] <Cork> cause i think jquery has already removed all the event listeners
[01:14:01] <Cork> jquery_ask: well i think you're linka stuck with copying the code from the original handler
[01:14:23] <Cork> cause i don't think there is any reference left, and actually might even be the code has been gc'ed
[01:17:05] <jquery_ask> hm the problem is not that the $document ready is not called its called, but too early
[01:17:13] <jquery_ask> i mean the document ready in the new content
[01:17:54] <Cork> jquery_ask: yes, cause it is triggered when the document is ready
[01:18:10] <Cork> ready does not take ajax or external resources into account
[01:20:59] <jquery_ask> but it is also triggered if i put the new document with that document ready into a document, in which other document already triggered?
[01:21:07] <jquery_ask> - how does this work?
[01:21:31] <jquery_ask> and how can i prevent this, cork?
[01:22:23] <jquery_ask> it is possible to work with two jquery instances with two namespaces?
[01:22:26] <Cork> jquery_ask: you would have to inject something in the page before the other .ready is called
[01:22:35] <Cork> and then override the entire .ready functionallity
[01:22:39] <Cork> no
[01:22:51] <Cork> jquery_ask: you are trying to use ready to something it is not meant for
[01:23:06] <Cork> jquery_ask: and naively you can't do it
[01:23:25] <Anticom> Morning Cork :)
[01:23:30] <Cork> jquery_ask: and the reson .ready triggers if you inject it into an existing page
[01:24:00] <Cork> jquery_ask: is cause it is a promised function; meaning if the event has triggered it will run your function directly when you call .ready
[01:24:06] <Cork> just as if you didn't use .ready at all
[01:24:21] <jquery_ask> ok
[01:24:24] <Cork> Anticom: g'morning
[01:24:44] <jquery_ask> and this direct call i cant prevent this
[01:24:55] <jquery_ask> i cant inject something or overwrite in jquery
[01:25:05] <jquery_ask> without changing the core jquery code
[01:26:20] <jquery_ask> ?
[01:27:06] <Anticom> what are you trying to achive jquery_ask ?
[01:27:37] <seutje> trying to have a callback upon injecting some ajaxed content
[01:27:54] <seutje> he's trying to use doc.rdy for it, somehow
[01:28:08] <Anticom> .live() is deprecated now isn't it seutje ?
[01:28:16] <Anticom> iirc that worked
[01:28:19] <seutje> yeah
[01:28:43] <seutje> did that trigger ready when injecting new stuff?
[01:29:01] <Anticom> well in the success-callback of your ajax request you'd have to register the callbacks AFTER you've appended your content to the DOM
[01:29:02] <jquery_ask> yes but too early
[01:29:18] <seutje> or use the promise from append
[01:29:32] <jquery_ask> promise?
[01:30:08] <Cork> Anticom: well it's been replaced by delegated syntax
[01:30:35] <Cork> and the problem here as long as i've understood it correctly
[01:30:42] <Anticom> Cork think it would be more clean / elegant to do both appending and registering callbacks in the success-callback of ajax-call, wouldn't it?
[01:30:46] <Cork> is that you try to after the fact call a ready callback, and that won't work
[01:30:47] <Anticom> jquery_ask http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+promise
[01:31:19] <Cork> Anticom: i like the promise syntax, but don't really care
[01:31:40] <Cork> Anticom: he can't move the code from the ready callback
[01:31:56] <Cork> so he can't use the promise
[01:32:14] <seutje> why can't he move the code from the rdy callback?
[01:32:25] <Anticom> Cork well it's also a question of performance, isn't it? I dunno exactly how jquery does it but it kind of must listen to any change of the dom and that eats up some resources especially on mobile devices, doesn't it?
[01:32:39] <Cork> cause it isn't added by him, or something like that
[01:32:45] <Cork> it was what he said at least
[01:32:54] <Anticom> guys is there a fiddle?
[01:33:00] <Anticom> i've just joined so i may have missed it
[01:33:02] <seutje> well, if all else fails, can always use a derp-timer to check if the shit was injected already
[01:33:04] <Cork> Anticom: promise is just a way to build a list of callbacks
[01:33:08] <Anticom> btw morning seutje aswell :P
[01:33:12] <jquery_ask> i want to do this: i want load a waiting message (a ffixed div 100% height and width), then my server works something a few secounds then my server said now load the real page and the the client should load the real page, which has it own content and it own jquery stuff it should be placed at the and of the actuell body and then the waitng message sshould dynamiclly disappear
[01:33:16] <Cork> Anticom: it is very close to perfromance from inline object callbacks
[01:33:40] <Anticom> Cork okay. You just make me smarter every day :)
[01:33:41] <seutje> jquery_ask: how about an iframe?
[01:33:51] <seutje> u can get a window.load off that, right?
[01:34:02] <Cork> jquery_ask: ya
[01:34:11] <Cork> sucks if you ask me though
[01:34:36] <Cork> jquery_ask: you could add a <script> tag at the end of the html and it would be about the same as ready
[01:34:59] <Anticom> tbh i still didn't quite get the problem
[01:34:59] <Cork> jquery_ask: personally i don't like adding js in the html, so i would prob send json instead
[01:35:43] <Cork> jquery_ask: and have something like { "html": "string", "action": "name-of-js-function-to-call" }
[01:36:09] <Cork> jquery_ask: that way you can have it dynamic and still structured and unobstructive
[01:36:13] <Anticom> why would you need the js from the server?
[01:36:16] <Anticom> is that a requirement?
[01:36:37] <jquery_ask> the new content is a html page a fixed html page with it own content
[01:36:42] <jquery_ask> i cant change this
[01:36:45] <Cork> Anticom: well you could bind a dynamic handler that calls a function if you always want to run the same function
[01:37:00] <Cork> jquery_ask: then you have a problem
[01:37:13] <Cork> jquery_ask: .ready won't ever trigger on ajax injection
[01:37:19] <Anticom> Cork why not if you can ensure to only bind it to the new context?
[01:37:21] <Anticom> content*
[01:37:31] <Anticom> if the html is encapsulated in a div.newContent or even better div#new-content-id-[n] it would be easy to call a method that does exactly that
[01:37:31] <jquery_ask> and if i do something seutje mentioned?
[01:37:36] <jquery_ask> an iframe?
[01:37:55] <Cork> yes that would work
[01:38:02] <Anticom> jquery_ask i'd say give it a shot, see if it works and if not come back here
[01:38:04] <Cork> though you would get another world of pain instead
[01:38:22] <jquery_ask> but the iframe then i have a lot of other problems
[01:38:25] <Cork> jquery_ask: if you use iframe you will basically load the second content as a separate page
[01:38:30] <Cork> and it will load like a new page
[01:38:41] <Cork> so everything in it will load like a normal full page load
[01:38:48] <jquery_ask> but then i dont have any controll to facebook canvas
[01:38:55] <jquery_ask> in it
[01:39:20] <Cork> jquery_ask: if you point the iframe to a different domain, you won't have access to the content at all
[01:39:31] <Cork> the browser will block you
[01:39:43] <jquery_ask> yes but facebook have a javscript sdk
[01:39:53] <jquery_ask> with that i can get access to the main window
[01:40:13] <jquery_ask> i can change the window height
[01:40:45] <jquery_ask> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Canvas.getPageInfo/
[01:41:31] <jquery_ask> ehm i meant : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Canvas.setSize/
[01:43:48] <seutje> not sure how that's related to anything, if u can access it in the page ur loading and ur serving it from the same domain, you are able to access it just the same from the parent window
[01:44:38] <Cork> if i remember correctly fb uses an iframe and sends the data to there server and proxies it over to the hosting page
[01:44:48] <Cork> so all the normal rules doesn't really apply
[01:45:17] <jquery_ask> i think thats old
[01:45:31] <seutje> if you run this from an iframe, that doesn't change anything
[01:45:45] <seutje> u still just call their global object on the correct window reference
[01:46:09] <jquery_ask> hm i think i have to test it
[01:46:14] <jquery_ask> and then i will see
[01:48:07] <Cork> seutje: if you call the js to create the iframe, and it loads an iframe with a session reference
[01:48:26] <Cork> seutje: and the page then talks with fb, you can then request data from the fd server with the current state from the iframe
[01:48:36] <Cork> seutje: sure you can't talk directly with the iframe content
[01:48:45] <Cork> but nothing prevents you from loading jsonp from there server
[01:49:03] <Cork> (or for the iframe to talk with the server it was loaded from)
[01:53:49] <chovy> does fadeTo not work with fadeIn after/
[01:53:50] <chovy> ?
[01:55:09] <seutje> Cork: which iframe are we talking? cause I was assuming he was loading it from the same domain, as he is just ajaxing HTML now
[01:55:32] <Cork> chovy: after what?
[01:55:54] <seutje> then instead of using FB.Canvas.getSize, he could just easily use iframeReference.FB.Canvas.getSize
[01:55:57] <Cork> seutje: ya it sounded like that from the start
[01:56:07] <Cork> but if he is using fb.canvas he isn't
[01:56:38] <seutje> haven't touched any of the facebook crap for like a year though
[01:56:47] <Cork> to be honest i'm not sure at all what he is doing anymore...
[01:56:58] <seutje> me neither ;P
[01:57:02] <Cork> seutje: haven't ever touched it personally
[01:57:04] <seutje> same shit, different day
[01:57:09] <seutje> I did it once
[01:57:17] <seutje> and swore not to be the expert around the office, ever
[01:57:32] <Cork> but i've helped ppl that have problem with it, and done regression tests with it so...
[01:57:37] <Cork> :)
[01:57:51] <chovy> Cork: i'm using fadeTo to fade a div out. and then i try to fadeIn() and nothing happens.
[01:57:53] <Cork> seutje: if you want to experience pain, try implementing a payment api
[01:58:15] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/gRM5G/
[01:58:17] <seutje> Cork: oh, I have experienced such agony
[01:58:20] <Cork> chovy: should work fine
[01:58:24] <steveccc> i have just done a responsive design using pure html and css but I wanted move some content so ventured into jquery to use insertAfter - is there any problem with using this - wasnt sure if responsve is supposed to be pure css
[01:58:40] <Cork> seutje: i did that aprox 2 years back
[01:59:03] <Cork> and had to implement an abstraction layer between me and the broker
[01:59:07] <seutje> steveccc: are you trying to determine if you can still call it "responsive" now?
[01:59:13] <Cork> cause it's api gave different responses all over the place >_<
[01:59:21] <seutje> Cork: joy to the world!
[01:59:21] <chovy> Cork: did you see this? http://jsfiddle.net/gRM5G/
[01:59:50] <Cork> chovy: looking
[02:00:21] <seutje> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/gRM5G/1/ ?
[02:00:52] <chovy> seutje: so fadeIn won't work? do you know why?
[02:00:55] <steveccc> seutje: i just want to do a correct responsive design an not sure if using jquery is "not allowed" whether if it isnt possible in css that it shouldnt be used. Ie if the user had javascript turned off then the design would break - I know there is a minute chance but it was a thought
[02:00:59] <seutje> iono, I avoid all the shorthands
[02:01:16] <seutje> tbh, I wouldn't even use fadeTo, but I guess that's personal preference
[02:01:52] <seutje> steveccc: anything I say would be meaningless without knowing the demographic
[02:02:10] <seutje> steveccc: generally, you can assume that nowadays everyone and their grandmother is running JS
[02:02:36] <seutje> steveccc: but that doesn't mean you shouldn't at least aspire to have the main content in the page onload
[02:02:58] <steveccc> seutje: i agree and at the end of the day it isnt possible with pure css and if the jquery didnt run then they would get exactly what they would have got if I hadnt written any jquery
[02:03:20] <seutje> steveccc: personally, if it's to correct issues that would otherwise be problematic (design-wise), I feel it's fine to have JS aid a bit
[02:03:31] <seutje> steveccc: exactly, so you are purely using it to enhance
[02:03:41] <seutje> not to create critical functionality
[02:03:44] <Cork> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/gRM5G/2/
[02:03:52] <jquery_ask> cork how can get the iframe ready that i know when i have to let the waiting message disappear
[02:04:14] <Cork> jquery_ask: you can't, you can get the .load event though
[02:04:18] <Cork> from the iframe element
[02:04:32] <seutje> that includes images (sorta, kinda...) and stuff
[02:04:35] <steveccc> seutje: its a div thats positioned in a left hand column under the menu. on a smaller resolution I want the menu and then the content but doing this takes the div I am concerned with and puts that at the top also when I want it at the bottom. Just used insertAfter to move it
[02:04:40] <jquery_ask> hes that i would say
[02:04:47] <jquery_ask> seutje
[02:04:55] <Cork> chovy: looks like fadeTo doesn't set the end flag for the fade, so fadeIn doens't know what to do
[02:05:17] <Cork> chovy: so you can either use fadeOut or only fadeTo
[02:05:58] <seutje> steveccc: what's the content of this div? think you could get away with having it in the page twice (onload), and just toggle display
[02:06:02] <seutje> on media queries
[02:07:25] <steveccc> seutje: yes i guess I could - its a list of 3 blog posts the person may also be interested in. Hence like you say I could have it twice and then hide the relevant one. I would question if having duplicate content is just as bad practice as using jquery but I guess it could be pure css then
[02:07:55] <seutje> steveccc: at least it won't drain as much battery power :P
[02:08:25] <seutje> cause if you do it with JS, you will also have to handle the media-query shenanigans and check it on every resize event
[02:13:33] <steveccc> seutje: yes i have written that on resize to check width and run the relevant part. I kinda think I could ignore that as I dont think anyone bar devs resizes their window so kinda think a check of resolution on load is enough
[02:13:52] <simon``> I'm looking at some code that does this: (jQuery.noConflict())(function ($) { ... }) -- in the examples from the API docs, I don't see this done. also, I'm not sure what object noConflict really returns. it just says Object.
[02:14:35] <Cork> simon``: it returns the jquery object
[02:14:43] <chovy> Cork: i use fadeTo(400, 1); but it isn't fading in.
[02:14:49] <simon``> Cork: ah, so that's fine.
[02:15:17] <Cork> simon``: olo
[02:15:25] <Cork> man that code took a white to read XD
[02:15:55] <Cork> simon``: so it basically does var jq = jQuery.noConflict(); jq(function($) {})
[02:16:04] <simon``> Cork: yes.
[02:16:05] <Cork> first time i've seen someone do it like that
[02:16:17] <simon``> yeah, me too. *shrug*
[02:16:23] <Cork> simon``: and unless you load multiple jquery versions in the same page, not needed
[02:16:41] <Cork> (and you should never load multiple versions of jquery on a page...)
[02:22:22] <seutje> steveccc: orientation change is also a resize event
[02:22:37] <seutje> (that is automatically caught by media queries)
[02:23:09] <steveccc> seutje: yes thanks - anything below 960 has the same layout so either orientation in terms of phone should be identical
[02:24:24] <seutje> steveccc: I bet there's tables that go over and under 960 as their orientation changes
[02:24:39] <seutje> or at least, there will be :P
[02:25:10] <steveccc> seutje: not on this site - although it does have a cms so the customer may decise to build them
[02:39:05] <leknoppix> Hello to all
[02:39:24] <leknoppix> join #grafikart
[02:43:01] <huglester> if I have: me = $(this); .. I later do $('input[name="username"]', me) .. it will search only inside me object?
[02:43:12] <Cork> yes
[02:43:18] <huglester> thanks Cork
[02:43:35] <Cork> huglester: also $('input[name="username"]', me) would be the same as me.find('input[name="username"]')
[03:20:11] <huglester> Cork: thanks.. and what about speed? or my options is like an alias for find?
[03:20:29] <huglester> because I always was wondering how to do better, maybe with find() or something
[03:20:36] <xec> huglester: like you said, your syntax is an alias
[03:24:32] <sathish> this is a question on json.stringify, it will be great if one of you can help me
[03:25:17] <gvo> sathish: ask
[03:25:17] <sathish> I have a jsfiddle, in which I am not able to get an array of object when I use json.stringify with replace parameter
[03:25:18] <sathish> http://jsfiddle.net/sJM9F/1/
[03:29:48] <Cork> sathish: http://jsfiddle.net/sJM9F/2/
[03:30:04] <Cork> sathish: you need to name all the keys to include
[03:30:08] <Cork> no matter the depth
[03:30:27] <Cork> if you want a finer control you need to use the function
[03:32:45] <sathish> Cork, thank you very much it worked
[03:32:55] <Car7i> hi there, i have a problem with jquery ajax, when ajax its completet in success function i want to open link in new tab i try window.open but only new windows
[03:32:59] <Car7i> window*
[03:33:27] <sathish> but is is kind of odd, that we give the object  name and then field names, without really tying them both together
[03:34:12] <Cork> Car7i: you can't do window.open from a success callback without triggering the popup blockers in browsers
[03:34:36] <Cork> sathish: ya, cause your using a simple filter
[03:35:52] <sathish> Thank you again Cork, this realy is going to help me a lot
[03:36:36] <Car7i> yeah i know that but how can i open new tab by success function of ajax, its that possible
[03:38:48] <Cork> Car7i: sure window.open() + asking the user to allow the popup
[03:38:53] <Cork> Car7i: other then that; no you can't
[03:39:15] <Cork> Car7i: alternatively you can revert the order and do the call from window.open(url) instead
[03:39:27] <Cork> that will work if it is from a user click action
[03:39:30] <Cork> and no blocking
[03:39:45] <Car7i> yeah i have done that but after allow popups its open new window not new tab :S
[03:40:17] <Cork> Car7i: that depends on the settings in the browser
[03:40:34] <Cork> Car7i: and ya, the user controls there browser, not the website
[03:54:25] <lemonsparrow> i have a variable say var count = 0; the count gets incremented based on certain actions and events... now is there a way I can trigger an event the moment count reaches a particular value say 4 ??
[04:00:18] <huglester> xec: thank you :) always good to be sure :)
[04:07:45] <Cork> lemonsparrow: no you can't
[04:08:03] <JonCJon> I need a plugin or something that lets me reorder a group of options (Key => Value) - any ideas?
[04:08:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you could use a proxy (modern browsers) or a function to handle the variable
[04:08:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and have it call a specific callback when the count is something
[04:08:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yes
[04:08:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: a method and then a trigger()
[04:08:53] <Cork> eh...
[04:09:11] <Cork> well ya, though i'm not sure i would go over dom events if it's not needed
[04:09:13] <lemonsparrow> Cork: guess what I am doing this for ?
[04:09:40] <Cork> JonCJon: you can't order an object, you need to create a new object with the order you want
[04:10:00] <Cork> JonCJon: shouldn't be too hard though
[04:10:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: n different ajax calls in single page.. want something to be implemented after nth ajax call is comepleted... no other go.. maintain a count and after all calls are over.. that is by checking the count... run the code
[04:10:26] <JonCJon> Cork: I mean like a select box or a group of checkboxes, I only need to know which are selected and in what order once the form is submitted
[04:10:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: why not just use promise?
[04:11:04] <Cork> JonCJon: in what order?
[04:11:35] <Cork> JonCJon: what checkboxes is selected is easy, the order makes it harder, but not really hard
[04:11:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: promise ?
[04:11:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: leme check
[04:11:51] <JonCJon> Cork: Yes, I want to allow the user to, say, be able to check checkboxes and reorder them... I really just want a plugin to do this, I've found a few but they just don't work
[04:12:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: take the jqXHR object from each ajax call and use $.then().done
[04:12:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: should do all you want
[04:12:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I am using DWR not primitive XHR
[04:12:35] <Cork> JonCJon: don't think there is a plugin for it, but it should be easy to write
[04:13:06] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well you could still create your own promise objects and use that i guess
[04:13:09] <JonCJon> Cork: Alright, any tips? I'm not too terribly well versed in JS or jquery
[04:14:40] <seutje> JonCJon, jQuery UI sortable?
[04:14:58] <Cork> ah, that would prob be the nicest solution
[04:15:02] <Cork> no checkbox though
[04:15:05] <JonCJon> Seutje: Anything, as long as it's JQuery 1.9
[04:15:10] <seutje> what ur sorting is arbitrary
[04:15:13] <Cork> but you actually drag the element instead
[04:15:24] <JonCJon> I need to know what the new order is and which are selected
[04:15:25] <seutje> but yeah, checking the checkbox might need some massaging
[04:15:43] <seutje> sortable has callbacks for when stuff is reordered
[04:16:02] <Cork> JonCJon: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#display-grid
[04:16:53] <JonCJon> Cork that looks good.. hmm and it has callbacks?
[04:16:58] <Cork> funny that i didn't think of this straight of, it is one of my fav plugins in jquery ui
[04:17:10] <Cork> JonCJon: callbacks, and you can do serialize on it too
[04:17:13] <JonCJon> So have a hidden field with the order?
[04:17:30] <Cork> you only need a hidden field if you do normal post
[04:17:37] <JonCJon> what do you mean?
[04:17:39] <Cork> for ajax you can just grab the data from the plugin
[04:17:45] <JonCJon> Ah no, no AJAX
[04:17:59] <Cork> then ya you need to have a hidden field
[04:18:00] <seutje> the way it's handled in drupal core is a sortable table row containing a hidden field with a weight, which gets updated on sort and is exposed if JS is disabled
[04:18:19] <Cork> seutje: it's not hidden
[04:18:32] <Cork> seutje: it is a select element that is used if you don't have js active
[04:18:45] <seutje> yeah
[04:18:51] <Cork> and it hid it with js when you enable sortable
[04:19:01] <Cork> really nice solution >_>
[04:19:02] <seutje> yeah, that's what I meant
[04:19:25] <seutje> it allows toggling it back and forth easily for ppl who can't figure out  drag&drop
[04:19:43] <seutje> or when u end up having a gigantic table crashing ur chromesies :P
[04:19:50] <JonCJon> Well, thanks Cork and seutje - I'll try that
[04:19:58] <Cork> seutje++
[04:20:03] <seutje> o.O
[04:23:59] <JonCJon> Hmm what if I would want to make this reorder thing as a multi select?
[04:24:51] <ggdevelop> in a php file if i have a javaScript function that called when user pressed a button and the function  change a variable of the php, is it really set a new value to the php variable? i cant understand what is the steps in this case when its a client and when the  server...
[04:25:03] <Cork> JonCJon: you could have a look at selectable
[04:25:13] <Cork> JonCJon: http://jqueryui.com/selectable/
[04:25:36] <Cork> though i don't think it will keep the order you have selected them in
[04:26:01] <Cork> JonCJon: but sortable can be a list if that is what you mean
[04:26:11] <Cork> JonCJon: you can style it quite a lot with css if you like
[04:26:26] <sacho> ggdevelop, php and javascript are executed in different environments. There are no php variables in javascript. There are no javascript functions to execute in php.
[04:26:59] <JonCJon> Cork: Was afraid of that... Guess I'll just mess around with sortable more
[04:27:29] <Cork> ggdevelop: the flow is: php generates html (text) > the text is sent over the wire > browser parses text > js gets lifted out > js runs
[04:27:42] <Cork> ggdevelop: nothing can flow from right to left in that order
[04:28:18] <seutje> unless you break the time-space continuum
[04:28:25] <Cork> :D
[04:28:29] <seutje> and we would appreciate it if you didn't
[04:29:01] <Cork> think of the speed up
[04:29:10] <Cork> the server could answer your request before you made them!
[04:30:27] <dropdrive> Is there something like $(...).filter() where not the *index* but the actual *element* is passed?
[04:31:13] <Cork> dropdrive: what do you want out?
[04:31:24] <Cork> if you have the element why do you need filter?
[04:32:02] <seutje> Cork: but what if I changed my mind in between? now I have data I don't want but expect to want... or something
[04:32:15] <seutje> or... can I even change my mind in between?
[04:32:52] <Cork> seutje: wouldn't change much from today
[04:33:01] <Cork> if you make a request and change your mind that is
[04:33:09] <seutje> :P
[04:33:15] <Cork> ;)
[04:33:18] <seutje> I can abort
[04:33:28] <seutje> but I can't abort something I haven't started yet q.q
[04:33:56] <Cork> well ya you can abort it until the server has started sending it
[04:34:13] <dropdrive> Cork: Say, I do $("td") but I want only the "td"s where the text contains a number
[04:34:35] <dropdrive> Cork: What I want out is those td's, so then I can change their CSS, etc.
[04:35:20] <dropdrive> Cork: Right now, I write $("td").each(function (i,e) {if (...) $(e).css(...)})
[04:35:33] <Cork> dropdrive: $('td').filter(function() { return parseInt(this.innerHTML, 10) !== NaN; })
[04:35:35] <dropdrive> Cork: I would prefer to write $("td").????.css(...)
[04:36:29] <Cork> dropdrive: so filter is what you want, you just want it to have a function instead
[04:36:42] <dropdrive> Cork: Oh, how did I miss that?  THanks.
[04:37:50] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/tKtBT/ anyone able to help me out on this? for some reason when I click on update it wont hide the names and show the form inputs
[04:39:55] <Cork> lundy: there is a result overlay on the right
[04:40:05] <Cork> lundy: try clicking on the left side of the U and it should work just fine
[04:40:57] <lundy> kk
[04:41:25] <seutje> or add some top margin so u can click it without hitting the label
[04:41:30] <seutje> seems to work fine
[04:41:40] <seutje> but be careful when using return false; in an event handler
[04:41:54] <seutje> it probably does more than you're intending to
[04:42:14] <Cork> ya event.preventDefault() is usually a better choice
[04:42:23] <Cork> and when we're at it, don't use href="#"
[04:42:35] <Cork> (use a tags for links not actions)
[04:42:37] <seutje> or style="" :P
[04:42:56] <Cork> well style do have it's usages
[04:43:11] <samuelchan> how about <script src="" />
[04:43:25] <samuelchan> um, how about <script src="script.js" />
[04:43:26] <Cork> you should never use self closing script tags
[04:43:26] <seutje> every td has width 50% inline style attr
[04:43:48] <samuelchan> never. gotcha
[04:43:51] <Cork> seutje: ok, didn't think about that ^^'
[04:44:17] <Cork> samuelchan: browsers will read <script src="script.js" /> as <script src="script.js">
[04:44:34] <Cork> meaning everything from there until a </script> will be seen as javascript
[04:45:00] <Cork> sam452: only content-type: application/xhtml+xml is an exception from that rule
[04:45:15] <Cork> (well and svg)
[04:45:18] <duckgoose> sounds like the browsers aren't following protocol then
[04:45:20] <seutje> which you probably shouldn't use unless ur using SVG
[04:45:25] <lundy> now im getting this
[04:45:25] <Cork> duckgoose: they are
[04:45:27] <lundy> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[04:45:27] <lundy> [Break On This Error] 	
[04:45:27] <lundy> $('.updateo').click(function(){
[04:45:41] <Cork> duckgoose: the only standard that has self closing tags is xhtml
[04:45:58] <Cork> duckgoose: html allows it, but it just ignores the trailing />
[04:46:00] <duckgoose> html5 supports self closing tags
[04:46:09] <Cork> ya, supports == ignores
[04:46:12] <seutje> lundy: tried to execute before jQuery was loaded? or running with noConflict?
[04:46:17] <Zerhackos> jquerymobile question. I'm trying to get anchors to work on a single page layout. Links should always get loaded via ajax, except links with anchors
[04:46:18] <Cork> <br/> == <br>
[04:46:20] <Zerhackos> these are on the same page
[04:46:24] <Zerhackos> definetly
[04:46:30] <Cork> <span/> != <span></span>
[04:46:37] <Cork> <span/> == <span>
[04:46:40] <duckgoose> of course not
[04:46:50] <duckgoose> why would you use self closing spans :P
[04:47:03] <seutje> icons
[04:47:06] <Cork> duckgoose: yes it is, but error correction in the browser will find a suitable location to close the span
[04:47:08] <Zerhackos> anyone got that working? :D
[04:47:22] <duckgoose> icons should be in block elements
[04:47:29] <duckgoose> you can't width or height a span
[04:47:50] <sammich> sure you can
[04:47:53] <Cork> duckgoose: sure you can, as long as you set the span to display: inline-block;
[04:47:55] <seutje> that's why everyone and their grandmother uses <i>s for icons
[04:47:59] <duckgoose> well thats rather annoying
[04:48:23] <seutje> it's web dev
[04:48:26] <duckgoose> self closing tags were a step forward
[04:48:32] <seutje> everything about it is "rather annoying"
[04:48:37] <duckgoose> what is the point of </input>
[04:49:02] <sammich> but <input> doesn't take anything inside it's tag
[04:49:06] <sammich> tag pair*
[04:49:16] <duckgoose> I know it doesnt so it should be self closing
[04:49:31] <sammich> I never close my input tags
[04:49:48] <sammich> textarea/button aside
[04:50:03] <seutje> input should not have a closing tag
[04:50:06] <seutje> "Must have a start tag and must not have an end tag."
[04:50:33] * AdamPDotty tries to imagine without start tag
[04:50:43] <seutje> :P
[04:50:58] <seutje> </input> <!-- fuck you, guess the type! -->
[04:51:42] <sammich> <html />
[04:53:57] <Anticom> what is the smartest way to scroll a container to the very bottom? i've got a div with a fixed height and overflow:scroll
[04:54:14] <Anticom> is $('#myDiv').scrollTop(-1) possible?
[04:54:26] <Cork> Anticom: scrollTop = scrollHeight
[04:54:46] <Anticom> ty Cork
[04:55:26] <Anticom> Cork um... can't find anything concerning scrollHeight :/
[04:56:03] <Cork> Anticom: var div = $('#myDiv'); div.scrollTop(div.prop('scrollHeight'))
[04:56:16] <Anticom> okay
[04:56:20] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollHeight
[04:57:10] <Anticom> Cork is that property cross browser?
[04:57:33] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.scrollHeight#Supported
[04:57:56] <Anticom> Cork just saw it... should have looked first before asking you^^
[04:58:02] <Anticom> thank's anyway. solution works fine
[04:59:00] <duckgoose> so you don't use </input>... anymore...
[04:59:02] <duckgoose> c___c
[04:59:33] <Cork> duckgoose: you haven't ever been able to
[04:59:49] <Cork> duckgoose: it has worked in some error correction solutions, but not others
[05:00:04] <duckgoose> I'm pretty sure I saw some official examples of it used
[05:00:11] <duckgoose> but then again that was from MS
[05:00:11] <Cork> duckgoose: the html standard has specified how error correction works, so all browsers do it the same now
[05:00:33] <duckgoose> well
[05:00:33] <Cork> duckgoose: and it most likely was mhtml
[05:00:55] <Cork> they did have that "idea" once upon a time...
[05:01:00] <duckgoose> just as well
[05:01:40] <duckgoose> I never liked putting that there anyway
[05:02:13] <duckgoose> which is why self closing was my hero! but if you don't have to close it at all... well then...
[05:02:43] <Cork> duckgoose: you should read the spec instead of what a broken vendor says
[05:03:13] <Cork> or read a tutorial written by someone that actually cares about standards :)
[05:03:29] <Cork> (and that excludes apple and ms)
[05:03:44] <duckgoose> when I started in this standards were pointless because nobody followed along :P
[05:03:59] <Cork> duckgoose: well sure i did too
[05:04:02] <duckgoose> you just made different versions for every single browser out there
[05:04:11] <Cork> but that is no excuse to do it 18 years later
[05:05:17] <duckgoose> I did read up on self closing tags before using them in html5
[05:05:27] <duckgoose> ...as much as "it works"
[05:05:38] <Cork> duckgoose: the standard is html or "html the living standard"
[05:05:49] <Cork> html5 is a buzzword without a real meaning
[05:06:08] <Cork> the propaganda has made sure of that
[05:06:26] <sammich> omg, I love you HTML5
[05:06:32] <AdamPDotty> hml5 = some sandard that might come sometime in the future
[05:07:06] <duckgoose> html5 is at a very usible state
[05:07:14] <Cork> AdamPDotty: no html5 is css + js + html + ajax + gpu acceleration + webgl + some other  buzzwords
[05:07:18] <duckgoose> and has fancy features
[05:07:34] <Cork> and as yes, it is html all browsers support it
[05:07:58] <Cork> that was the maijor point of standardizing it
[05:08:16] <Cork> before you had error corrections that differed between each browser
[05:08:52] <Cork> so broken html could look correct in one browser, but totally broken in another (and both would still be valid html 4 parsers)
[05:09:32] <Cork> half through html5 they dropped the numbering cause there won't ever be an incompatible version, so no need for the versions
[05:09:45] <Cork> so now it's just supported or not supported tags
[05:09:52] <Cork> (and attributes)
[05:13:26] <duckgoose> sounds like a good way to break things again
[05:14:06] <Cork> duckgoose: why browsers implement the support as they can
[05:14:40] <Cork> duckgoose: and the tag doesn't get official flagging as supported until two of the three engines (before 3 of 4) supports it
[05:16:33] <Cork> duckgoose: the versions doesn't mean anything
[05:17:07] <Cork> duckgoose: just look at css2.1 where they had to go back and change the spec several years after releasing it, cause no browser supported some of the spec
[05:17:10] <Ericx2x> Is anyone capable of replicating this site? http://adayinbigdata.com/
[05:18:17] <duckgoose> it makes sense
[05:18:21] <Cork> Ericx2x: doesn't look to be much more then a scroll event handler that checks the scroll from the top
[05:20:24] <duckgoose> the only thing it would take to replicate that site is time
[05:20:30] <duckgoose> and time = $
[05:21:12] <sammich> "Save as HTML, complete"
[05:21:13] <sammich> done
[05:21:37] <Cork> lol
[05:23:52] <duckgoose> if you achieve the same effect without seeing the code it's all good
[05:24:47] <duckgoose> and naturally you can't lift the graphics

[05:28:27] <Trudko> hi guys i have simple ajax call from page index.html(on my desktop) to nodejs app which is on my localhost. Request is sent but I always get eror http://jsfiddle.net/F2HFY/  - values i get back  readyState=0, status=0, statusText="error"
[05:29:15] <Cork> Trudko: most likely cors blocking you
[05:29:44] <Cork> Trudko: you can't make xss calls without the server allowing it, and some browsers block it all together from file://
[05:30:25] <Trudko> Cork: well I tried FF and it got to server (I checked it in console)
[05:30:40] <Cork> Trudko: ya, the request goes through
[05:30:50] <Cork> that is how it checks if the server allows the call
[05:31:23] <Cork> if the server doesn't actively tells the browser that xss ajax is allowed the browser will throw away the response though
[05:31:32] <Cork> (and throw an error)
[05:54:45] <gvo> is there a way to return an array with the html values of DIV elements with a certain class.  Something like var array = $('.thisclass').html();?? that doesn't work.
[05:56:20] <gvo> I can do it the hard way via "var cl = $('.thisclass');" and iterating over the cl array, pulling the innerHTML values, but I wondered if there was a jquery shorthand.
[05:59:21] <Car7i> gvo: $('.thisclass').children();
[06:00:30] <gvo> Car7i: Thanks.
[06:01:04] <Krisostoomus> hello please help me to get a object....http://pastebin.com/RQ2FW8Yf   i want the previous object to be used in xXx()....
[06:02:13] <Krisostoomus> originally it was enter().append("path").attr("d", path); I need to write into console before append..
[06:03:00] <Krisostoomus> are there any geniuses who can help ?
[06:11:28] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: is this D3.js ?
[06:11:42] <Krisostoomus> yeah
[06:12:31] <Krisostoomus> How can i do so that it will tell me the country when on this country with mouse?
[06:12:38] <Krisostoomus> you know something about this?
[06:12:49] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: .data(topo...., xXx(d)).enter();
[06:13:28] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: second parameter of data its callback function
[06:14:44] <Krisostoomus> where do u know this man?
[06:15:14] <Car7i> its working is that what u ask for
[06:16:00] <Krisostoomus> actually its not writing me Xx, when entering a country...
[06:17:19] <Krisostoomus> now it says 177 Xx
[06:17:51] <Krisostoomus> is there possible to print the country name which is entered also, you know something about this?
[06:18:48] <Krisostoomus> this seems to be wrong place to alert something
[06:18:49] <Car7i> what this is doing its giving u the id of country i think so u can handle by id
[06:20:49] <Krisostoomus> it seems to first place the countries paths. i need to get the function which is called when entering the country(when it displays the country outlines)
[06:21:49] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: world.objects.countries is array right ?
[06:23:58] <Krisostoomus> i only need this function location.
[06:24:25] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: srry im not getting it !! :S u need to know which country u have clicked or .... ?
[06:24:45] <Krisostoomus> no, wait a sec i'll put it up
[06:26:48] <Krisostoomus> look at http://private-carsale.com/worldmap/index.html
[06:27:53] <freebirD2> hi, I've this link, that when I click, I see a fade pop up window, I would like to see this fade pop windows being loaded when the website is first loaded, like in here: http://www.barprovidencia.com.br/
[06:28:24] <freebirD2> the code I've is this one: <a data-rel="fancybox"						class="blog-continue-reading fancybox.iframe"					data-fancybox-group=""						href="http://revistaroteirogastronomico.blogspot.com.br/"						title="Blog"> BLOG </a>
[06:28:32] <Krisostoomus> I cant find where is the function which is called when entering a country. this previous thing is called on initializing only to mark countries outlines..
[06:28:42] <freebirD2> how can I trigger this pop up when the site is loaded ?
[06:29:56] <seutje> Krisostoomus: nothing, it seems, the stroke is accomplished using css :hover pseudo selector
[06:30:33] <seutje> aren't any mouseover handlers being fired
[06:30:34] <Krisostoomus> thanks
[06:30:46] <Krisostoomus> i'll look this
[06:31:21] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: yeah thats right index.html: 19
[06:31:28] <Car7i> css stroke
[06:32:33] <seutje> Krisostoomus: there's one mousedown handler on the paths, but it looks like it's d3 checking if it has some internal handler to fire
[06:32:46] <seutje> function (e){var r=ya.event;ya.event=e,t[0]=this.__data__;try{n.apply(this,t)}finally{ya.event=r}}
[06:35:03] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: take a look at index.html line: 226 a mousedown function called for rotation an prevent d3 defulat event for that !!
[06:35:04] <Krisostoomus> i need to read the docs
[06:35:50] <Krisostoomus> thanks....
[06:36:09] <Krisostoomus> i can probably now print something when a country is entered!!
[06:41:41] <seutje> D3 does a lot of internal handling, so you probably wanna work with its API instead of along side it
[06:42:12] <Krisostoomus> okey, thanx
[06:43:17] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: i just try to hande d3.event inside function mousedown at line:226 and when i click in path gives me the clicked element
[06:45:04] <Krisostoomus> Can u paste this?
[06:45:11] <Krisostoomus> to pastebin.com
[06:45:52] <Krisostoomus> Im doing some ugly programming http://pastebin.com/mWyZdmPD
[06:50:39] <er_dos> hey there
[06:51:07] <er_dos> is it possible to shuffle the position of an element within its parent without removing and reinserting?
[06:51:24] <er_dos> i want to shuffle a div, but i don't want to lose the events attached to it
[06:51:40] <Krisostoomus> everything is possible
[06:52:13] <Krisostoomus> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWmutuJIM_w
[06:52:40] <er_dos> well that's great news!
[06:52:42] <er_dos> now
[06:52:45] <er_dos> tell me how to do it
[06:53:10] <Krisostoomus> read the docs first
[06:53:18] <er_dos> ffffffffff
[06:53:33] <Krisostoomus> :D:D
[06:53:38] <er_dos> how did you just have that link ready to go with that song anyway?
[06:53:53] <Krisostoomus> magic
[06:54:15] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: http://pastebin.com/6ymiRhBe - mousedown handle
[06:54:39] <er_dos> so... is there a function that does this? i poked around and i couldn't find one
[06:54:45] <Krisostoomus> Thanks a lot!!!
[06:55:18] <Car7i> Krisostoomus: i change the stroke color just to test
[06:55:40] <Krisostoomus> Thanks a lot again! :)

[07:05:10] <mad_mode_on> I want to conditionally exhibit a message with jQuery in my PHP code. Here it is $("#feedback").text("User already exists!"); $("#feedback").fadeOut(4000);     Assuming "feedback" is the ID of a div, how do I combine this with my PHP code?
[07:05:38] <gonnarule> hi guys
[07:05:42] <gonnarule> guys, anyone know why jQuery("div[class^='string']") doesn't match anything ?
[07:07:11] <xec> gonnarule: there is no div with class attribute starting with 'string' at the time the line of code runs
[07:07:36] <xec> ...most likely
[07:07:38] <xec> :D
[07:08:06] <gonnarule> damn.. it should be
[07:08:28] <gonnarule> if I replace with jQuery("div.string1") it works
[07:08:41] <xec> gonnarule: are there multiple classes on the same div?
[07:08:47] <gonnarule> but jQuery("div[class^='string']") doesn't
[07:08:52] <gonnarule> yes
[07:09:10] <xec> ^= will only match from the very start of the attribute
[07:09:18] <xec> you'll probably need a custom filter
[07:09:20] <gonnarule> I even tried jQuery("div.foo[class^='string']")
[07:09:55] <gonnarule> might be that xec, thanks
[07:10:01] <gonnarule> will look at those selectors
[07:10:48] <sammich> [class*=match]
[07:11:17] <gonnarule> xec : *= instead of ^= is one of the solutions
[07:11:29] <gonnarule> indeed sammich
[07:12:05] <sammich> why aren't you using the usual CSS declarations for classes?
[07:15:13] <xec> gonnarule: no no, this is way easier http://jsfiddle.net/eGQNa/
[07:16:41] <mad_mode_on> I want to conditionally exhibit a message with jQuery in my PHP code. Here it is $("#feedback").text("User already exists!"); $("#feedback").fadeOut(4000);     Assuming "feedback" is the ID of a div, how do I combine this with my PHP code?
[07:17:07] <xec> exhibit?
[07:17:13] <mad_mode_on> display
[07:17:14] <mad_mode_on> sorry
[07:17:51] <gonnarule> xec : your example works but what about performance ? and what difference compared to the *= selector ?
[07:17:51] <Anny> hello... is someone can help to me please ? http://jsfiddle.net/k4F9a/
[07:18:04] <gonnarule> sammich : what do you mean ?
[07:18:14] <Andrew_R> wouldn't it be easier to give everything a common "string" class that does nothing but can be used as a selector?
[07:18:23] <sammich> why use [class] when you can use .class?
[07:18:32] <Andrew_R> <div class="something string string1"></div> $('div.string')
[07:18:34] <xec> gonnarule: the *= is probably faster (depending on browser age) but will match anything containing "string" so could give false positives
[07:18:45] <gonnarule> because I want to use a common name with a number for all my classes
[07:19:00] <gonnarule> like string1 string2 string3 etc. and select all those which begins with string
[07:19:03] <xec> gonnarule: you could do both, like Andrew_R suggests
[07:19:16] <gonnarule> yep
[07:19:48] <gonnarule> it's actually designed this way, but I could add some common class to all of my div to select them too
[07:21:07] <Andrew_R> mad_mode_on: PHP generates output (HTML/JS/etc), your jquery code code has to be in the output
[07:21:29] <xec> sammich: because the class name *starts* with string, like .string1 and .string2
[07:22:23] <sammich> xec: yeah I figured as much and wanted to lead to what Andrew_R_ suggested
[07:25:52] <xec> Anny: we're not going to code a complete solution for you. have a go at it yourself and if you're stuck at some point ask about the specific part you're struggling with
[07:26:10] <xec> Anny: also, show us what you've tried so far
[07:30:16] <Anny> xec yes sure for example this one where is problem  http://jsfiddle.net/W8VcV/
[07:30:54] <xec> Anny: there is no javascript code in that demo, much less jquery
[07:30:59] <vsync1> Okay this probably comes across as retarded, however. Will disabling a submit button prevent sending the form overall?
[07:31:15] <AdamPDotty> nope
[07:31:34] <vsync1> AdamPDotty: was that for me?
[07:32:09] <AdamPDotty> You can usually submit by hiting NTER in a text field
[07:32:17] <AdamPDotty> or with javascript submit()
[07:32:20] <vsync1> Yeah that's what I was afraid of
[07:33:09] <vsync1> So basically I have this form firing an ajax call, what'd be a fullproof way to say make sure one user can't do more than say ~a call per 3 sec?
[07:33:16] <Andrew_R> I don't think Enter will submit it if the submit button is disabled, but definitely with javascript
[07:33:54] <xec> vsync1: have a flag and a setTimeout?
[07:34:22] <vsync1> Hmh yeah that's good I guess
[07:34:56] <sammich> foolproof*
[07:35:38] <xec> vsync1: there is also throttle for stuff like that http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[07:35:45] <vsync1> foolproof* yeh
[07:37:48] <grafi> sammich vsync1 "something something, better fool"
[07:40:20] <xec> lol
[07:41:00] <grafi> new loading/spinner plugin: http://1-ps.googleusercontent.com/h/www.catgifpage.com/gifs/176.gif.pagespeed.ce.rqeMpQHWzj.gif
[07:41:03] <gonnarule> jquery validate plugin related : I've got 1 form containing 5 divs with questions. Each div is displayed one after the other if the fields contained in the div are ok. So I want to be able to feel 1 div, validate with the "next" button, get the 2nd div to show, validate with others rules, etc.
[07:41:28] <grafi> sounds complicated
[07:42:22] <gonnarule> Is there a way to stock in a variable the rules from the validation, which are set this way for me : jq(selector).validate({rules:{},messages:{}}); ?
[07:42:44] <xec> gonnarule: by "feel", do you mean "fill"?
[07:43:00] <gonnarule> xec :erf sorry, end of day here :)
[07:43:04] <xec> :D
[07:43:05] <gonnarule> xec : of course fill, not feel
[07:44:18] <gonnarule> something like var step1_form = {rules:{},messages{}}; so I could call jQ(form).validate(step1);
[07:45:10] <vsync1> Hmm. Is there something wrong with $('.button, input[name="name"]') ?
[07:46:00] <grafi> looks weird
[07:46:01] <grafi> oô
[07:47:27] <Bheam> yo
[07:47:44] <Bheam> is there any way to know if an event is called directly or via user action?
[07:48:05] <Bheam> ie $element.focus(); or by user clicking on $element
[07:48:18] <Bheam> in $element.on('focus', ...)
[07:48:51] <gonnarule> vsync1 works to me, why ?
[07:51:01] <grafi> Bheam when you trigger an event in your code you can pass variables i think, that could be an easy way to distinguish
[07:52:03] <grafi> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ see the "extraParameters"
[07:52:41] <Anny> please help... about what function i must googling in case if i need somethign like  "if value < 10" or if value < 10 ?
[07:59:10] <Andrew_R> I need to add a static footer to the bottom of a jqueryui autocomplete list
[07:59:25] <Andrew_R> the list is a <ul>
[07:59:54] <gvo> anny: maybe http://www.webteacher.com/javascript/
[08:01:56] <xec> gvo: what a horrible resource - onclick="" and document.write() ??
[08:02:21] <gvo> It's just an intro to js
[08:02:47] <gvo> Sorry
[08:03:13] <gonnarule> anyone could look http://jsfiddle.net/GS92L/ and say why the validation isn't working (just moved jq(form).validate({foo}) to var obj={foo} and jq(form).validate(foo)
[08:03:28] <gonnarule> validate(obj)
[08:08:56] <xec> Anny: you can check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Statements#Conditional_Statements
[08:10:13] <xec> Anny: and to read/write values to <input>s , you can look at http://api.jquery.com/val/
[08:10:47] <Anny> xec.. thank you, looks that is it  what i need
[08:11:00] <gonnarule> can we do that : a function "foo", with inside a setTimeout, which call the function "foo" ? I really suspect my setTimeout to "die" as soon as the function is ended (and therefore not calling again the function)
[08:11:58] <xec> gonnarule: you're defining a function *inside* a setTimeout??
[08:12:08] <xec> and then what
[08:12:23] <gonnarule> http://jsfiddle.net/GS92L/
[08:12:33] <gonnarule> line 76
[08:13:04] <xec> gonnarule: sure, that looks fine to me
[08:13:54] <gonnarule> yes ? the timeout isn"t dying when the first call of the function ends ?
[08:13:55] <deosama1> What's the difference between setting display: none; and using hide()?
[08:14:16] <gonnarule> hide() can animate it
[08:14:28] <deosama1> animate it?
[08:14:36] <gonnarule> hide(500)
[08:14:40] <deosama1> ahhh
[08:14:42] <gonnarule> or hide("fast")
[08:14:53] <deosama1> other than that?
[08:15:03] <deosama1> Is there a resource difference?
[08:15:17] <gonnarule> don't know, think it perform some animation if needed and then put to display;none
[08:15:31] <deosama1> soo....
[08:15:31] <doug65536> deosama1: .hide() is obviously much smaller and less typing than .css({display:'none'})
[08:15:39] <gonnarule> well display:none is the fatest way I bet
[08:15:41] <deosama1> they're essentially the same thing...
[08:16:00] <doug65536> gonnarule: there is no speed difference
[08:16:11] <gonnarule> ok
[08:16:24] <deosama1> I just wrote some code for work and when it got reviewed they suggested i use display: none; instead of hide()
[08:16:28] <doug65536> gonnarule: hide puts display: none on it if you look at the code
[08:16:28] <deosama1> and I'm wondering why...
[08:16:41] <xec> gonnarule: http://jsfiddle.net/WZjJX/ does that answer the question?
[08:17:18] <gonnarule> xec : hehe indeed
[08:17:29] <gonnarule> so.. I....have...another...problem.. here :)
[08:28:30] <gonnarule> damn, I'm using hide() to hide some div, and then I check the div with .filter(":visible"); and always return true, even if hide() is called
[08:30:11] <doug65536> gonnarule: :hidden
[08:30:47] <shesek> gonnarule, to check, use .is()
[08:30:48] <gonnarule> but :visible should return false once hide() called
[08:31:00] <shesek> .filter() filter the sets of node, but the returned object is still truthy
[08:31:15] <shesek> so checking with `if ($(..).filter(':hidden'))` wouldn't work
[08:31:20] <gonnarule> jquery doc http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/ says to use .filter(":visible") so...
[08:31:24] <shesek> (if that's what you were doing?)
[08:31:45] <shesek> gonnarule, yes, to filter the set of matched DOM nodes, not to check if an element is visible
[08:31:59] <gonnarule> ahh
[08:32:00] <gonnarule> sorry
[08:32:08] <gonnarule> of course
[08:34:37] <Techtony96> Hey guys, Can anyone help me with jQuery PowerTips? http://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/
[08:35:51] <doug65536> Techtony96: help what
[08:36:25] <Techtony96> doug65536: I have a webpage, http://web.mineplex.com/ServerTracker/Lobby.php that i am trying to get some text above each picture.
[08:36:52] <doug65536> Techtony96: you aren't loading jquery
[08:36:59] <doug65536> $ is not defined
[08:37:21] <doug65536> you need jquery before powertip.js
[08:37:29] <Techtony96> ok
[08:37:38] <doug65536> powertip is a jquery plugin
[08:37:54] <Techtony96> ok, i added that.
[08:38:14] <doug65536> ok fixed the crashes... looking
[08:40:13] <Techtony96> doug65536:  i can give you the original php if that helps
[08:41:20] <doug65536> Techtony96: you probably need to use $('.image') as the selector
[08:41:31] <doug65536> Techtony96: your html is invalid. id must be unique
[08:41:39] <doug65536> you can't have many id="north"
[08:41:45] <Techtony96> oh ok
[08:42:36] <gvo> I'm doing an ajax call using $.post to a cgi script over https.  I suspect it's failing because my cert is self signed.  How can I tell it to ignore/approve the cert?
[08:43:01] <Malcor> Hello could I have some help with Jquery UI please?
[08:43:06] <doug65536> Techtony96: each of those elements needs data-powertip="This is the text in the powertip"
[08:43:22] <Techtony96> ok
[08:43:33] <doug65536> their name or something
[08:44:46] <Techtony96> now it does nothing :(
[08:47:39] <Malcor> I am trying to use icons with Accordion but it doesn't seem to be showing. Here is my current code. Could I have some help please. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4777114/accordion_JQUI_Help.txt

[08:50:23] <gonnarule> Malcor > jsfiddle.net
[08:50:47] <Techtony96> thanks
[08:50:55] <Techtony96> i will see if that works
[08:57:32] <Malcor> how do I use jsfiddle, without JqueryUI css but still using JqueryUI?
[08:58:27] <Malcor> because the css of jqury UI overides my stuff. I don't want it too at all. Hencve why I sent the code in a text file.
[08:58:43] <doug65536> Malcor: use external dependencies
[08:59:00] <doug65536> Malcor: put in css and js you want it to load
[09:00:22] <Malcor> sorry, how do I  use external dependencies?
[09:01:24] <doug65536> Malcor: you put in a FULL url link to something (like http://blahblahblah/jquery-ui.min.js) and click +
[09:01:35] <elyphas> Hi, How can I do this: form name="frmDictamen" action="cmdDictamen_odt" method="get"> ; but with jquery and ajax??
[09:01:36] <Malcor> its not online!
[09:01:53] <doug65536> what isn't online
[09:01:58] <doug65536> jquery ui?
[09:02:03] <Malcor> no my own css
[09:02:20] <doug65536> your css goes in the top right area
[09:02:57] <doug65536> Malcor: top left is html, top right is css, bottom left is js, bottom right is running page
[09:03:04] <Malcor> oh instead of using the checkbox for jqurey UI, just use the js file in external resources?

[09:04:32] <cdehaan> doug65536: Still not applying :/ Do I need a url() in there somewhere?
[09:04:54] <doug65536> cdehaan: not running the code in document ready? $(function { ... this is run in document ready or immediately if ready already ... });
[09:05:08] <doug65536> cdehaan: oops, function()
[09:05:20] <cdehaan> doug65536: Oh wait, this works: $(".main").css({"background-image": "url(image.png)"})
[09:05:48] <doug65536> cdehaan: ah ok then :)
[09:06:38] <cdehaan> One other question... how do I concatenate within this statement? I really want something like this (i'm randomly selecting an image): $(".main").css("background-image", "url(" + item.image + ")");
[09:06:55] <doug65536> cdehaan: the obvious way
[09:07:32] <doug65536> cdehaan: $(".main").css({"background-image": "url(image" + something + ".png)"})
[09:08:19] <doug65536> cdehaan: yes do exactly what you said
[09:08:34] <doug65536> cdehaan: well, I would suggest passing an object, but yeah
[09:09:27] <cdehaan> doug65536: So item.image should be the full image URL, but this doesn't work: $(".main").css({"background-image": "url(" + item.image + ")"});
[09:09:47] <doug65536> cdehaan: then item.image must not be valid
[09:09:50] <doug65536> did you check it?
[09:10:30] <doug65536> cdehaan: look at the element in the html for style="background-image: url(whatever)" in debugger
[09:10:39] <doug65536> cdehaan: that's where is stuffs css overrides
[09:10:44] <cdehaan> doug65536: It still says "none"
[09:11:22] <doug65536> cdehaan: then put a console.log(item.image) before the line that sets that css and check console
[09:11:37] <doug65536> cdehaan: what you're trying to do works
[09:11:49] <doug65536> cdehaan: it's a bug somewhere else
[09:12:35] <Malcor> Is this better? http://jsfiddle.net/malcor88/qMgFX/
[09:13:04] <doug65536> Malcor: it works for me. what isn't working
[09:13:16] <Malcor> I can't get the custom icons working.
[09:13:55] <Malcor> running through the APi documentation, I am must not be reading it correctly, but be on this for the past 2 hours lol.
[09:14:31] <cdehaan> doug65536: OK, giving that a shot. Not seeing anything in my log, so trying to figure out where the error is
[09:15:07] <doug65536> cdehaan: do you use chrome debugger?
[09:15:26] <cdehaan> doug65536: Yeah that's what I'm using
[09:15:31] <doug65536> cdehaan: if so, click the little stop sign at the bottom until it is red. it will break into script immediately on error
[09:15:38] <doug65536> cdehaan: in sources tab
[09:17:12] <cdehaan> Hmm, also not seeing anything there when changing it to red (purple?) and refreshing the page
[09:18:01] <doug65536> yeah, almost purple
[09:18:22] <doug65536> that's purple I guess... I just don't get how purple has any meaning for stopping :D
[09:19:32] <cdehaan> doug65536: Does this not show the source of things in a <script> at the head of the page, not external?
[09:20:47] <cdehaan> doug65536: Nevermind, figured out how to see the source, still not seeing errors though
[09:21:06] <doug65536> Malcor:  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qMgFX/2/
[09:21:45] <doug65536> Malcor: there was nothing in the divs and they didn't have a size and they were not block elements so they couldn't be sized. I fixed all that in css
[09:22:17] <doug65536> Malcor: empty div is zero size (completely invisible)
[09:23:17] <doug65536> Malcor: you screwed up the class name in the js http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/qMgFX/4/
[09:24:38] <Malcor> lol, so I did. Thank you you very much .
[09:24:51] <doug65536> Malcor: np
[09:25:24] <doug65536> cdehaan: what thing? jsfiddle?
[09:25:36] <doug65536> cdehaan: oh you mean chrome debugger
[09:25:48] <doug65536> cdehaan: click the little icon thing at the top left corner of the source display
[09:26:02] <doug65536> cdehaan: click sources
[09:26:06] <doug65536> cdehaan: find your file
[09:26:46] <guspollos> does the phrse "top scores online now" make any sense?
[09:27:12] <doug65536> guspollos: why not "top scores"
[09:27:26] <guspollos> I want to emphasize that they're online now
[09:27:40] <doug65536> ah, see I didn't pick up on that
[09:27:49] <doug65536> guspollos: why not "top scores (playing online now)"
[09:28:00] <doug65536> or just playing now
[09:28:24] <doug65536> currently playing?
[09:28:45] <duch_kazatel> current top scores
[09:28:52] <duch_kazatel> (then you get to define "current")
[09:28:58] <duch_kazatel> "top scores in the last 5 minutes"
[09:29:26] <doug65536> top scores (players online now) ?
[09:29:45] <doug65536> it's tricky to be precise and sound good at the same time :)
[09:31:02] <doug65536> current would not imply that those players were playing... I would drop that and interpret it as "top scores"
[09:31:53] <doug65536> "top scores" has an implied "top scores ever" meaning
[09:35:45] <trepe> hi! If I call my plugin from the html using $('#myElement').myPlugin();  how can I get the 'myElement' inside the plugin, without passing it as a parameter? I was trying to use 'this' but that didn't work.
[09:36:11] <doug65536> trepe: you probably want this.each(function() { ... })
[09:36:26] <doug65536> trepe: it's not necessarily one object, a selector could refer to many
[09:37:11] <trepe> doug65536 so the whole plugin code should be put inside the code above?
[09:37:29] <doug65536> trepe: that depends
[09:38:23] <doug65536> trepe: what would happen if I did $('.someclass').myPlugin();    and there were 10 objects with class="someclass"
[09:38:42] <Malcor> doug65536, seriously, thank you so much. I think I may have turned to drugs if you haddn't of helped. Also thank you for explaing what I had done wrong.
[09:38:59] <doug65536> Malcor: lol np
[09:39:49] <trepe> doug65536 allright, thanks. And after that I could just get the value using 'this' ?
[09:41:24] <doug65536> trepe: see 'using the each() method' at http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[09:42:09] <doug65536> trepe: 'this' refers to the selector at the scope you were trying to use it at, because you return this to "chain" the selector
[09:42:37] <cdehaan> I'm really confused... why does this in the head of my HTML page not work?         <script type="text/javascript">$(".main").css({"background-image": "url(/research_images/clump.png)"})</script>      When I test, $(".main").css("background-image") returns "none"
[09:42:41] <doug65536> $('a').text('foo').attr('bar', 'baz')    <-- .text() returned the 'this' which represented the selector
[09:42:48] <doug65536> trepe: ^
[09:43:40] <doug65536> trepe: and to answer your last question, yes I think so
[09:44:13] <doug65536> trepe: if you use this.each(...), return it too, so the caller can chain it
[09:44:23] <doug65536> trepe: return this.each(...)
[09:55:55] <doug65536> trepe: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/MQLBk/6/
[09:57:59] <doug65536> trepe: also, see the $ and jQuery in this one http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/MQLBk/7/
[09:58:20] <doug65536> trepe: you can't rely on $ without passing it in from jQuery just in case the user is disabling the $ for compatibility
[10:01:12] <trepe> doug65536, ah now I'm totally confused, anyways, thanks for the help! :)
[10:02:55] <GreyTrilby> Hi chaps - having issue with a typeerror () not a valid function. Only loading jquery and jq validation scripts (in correct order) - any ideas what the problem might be?
[10:03:01] <Jayflux> how can i use jquery to fire when an element appears in the DOm?
[10:03:34] <GreyTrilby> Jayflux - is the appearance triggered by a jQuery event?
[10:03:42] <Jayflux> GreyTrilby:  nope
[10:03:50] <doug65536> Jayflux: good luck with that
[10:03:53] <GreyTrilby> Jayflux - so just when it loads?
[10:04:14] <Jayflux> GreyTrilby:  there's another peice of javascript writing to the dom when it loades data (non-jquery)
[10:04:34] <Sendoushi> guys... how can i select a script element with type text/x-handlebars-template ?
[10:04:42] <doug65536> Jayflux: in what scope is that function? you could wrap it and intercept calls to it
[10:04:44] <GreyTrilby> hmm.. you might be able to bring it in with a callback in the onload
[10:05:02] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi are you looking to select it using jquery?
[10:05:04] <systemfault> Sendoushi: You usually add an id to it…. and then use the id to select it.
[10:05:12] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: yep
[10:05:19] <Sendoushi> systemfault: i'm trying to delete all of those
[10:05:24] <Sendoushi> which may be quite a few
[10:05:35] <duch_kazatel> $('script[type="x-handlebars-template"]') should work
[10:05:51] <duch_kazatel> though why you're doing that is an entirely different question
[10:05:54] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: tried
[10:06:13] <Sendoushi> but wait a sec...
[10:06:19] <Sendoushi> console logging
[10:06:30] <GreyTrilby> Any thoughts on why I'm getting typeerror (...) validate() is not a function - I'm calling all the scripts in the correct order, and I've got nothing else running to conflict with JQ...
[10:07:07] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: j('script[type="text/x-handlebars-template"]') this works. i was doing that but didn't console it. what it doesn't work is the j(this).remove
[10:07:11] <Sendoushi> i'm doing an each by the way
[10:07:25] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi why in the world are you selecting script tags with jquery?
[10:07:36] <Sendoushi> so i can delete them
[10:07:43] <duch_kazatel> using jquery?
[10:07:54] <Sendoushi> how would you do it?
[10:08:00] <Sendoushi> document get element?
[10:08:03] <duch_kazatel> delete them from my codebase.
[10:08:09] <duch_kazatel> instead of doing it via jquery...
[10:08:09] <Sendoushi> hum?
[10:08:26] <duch_kazatel> how is this content getting written to the page?
[10:09:00] <Sendoushi> through handlebars/jquery ?
[10:09:06] <Sendoushi> or are you talking about the scripts?
[10:09:09] <duch_kazatel> because deleting using jquery sounds really... strange.  why not just remove the code that's writing it in?
[10:09:11] <Sendoushi> the scripts are written by hand
[10:09:23] <Techtony96> doug65536:  Are you still there?
[10:09:26] <Sendoushi> because i need it duch
[10:09:30] <doug65536> lol he left already?
[10:09:31] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RNLN4/2/
[10:09:42] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: unless... how do you use handlebars?
[10:10:03] <doug65536> Techtony96: yes
[10:10:08] <GreyTrilby> \me slaps forehead
[10:10:09] <duch_kazatel> erm, I don't.  but something tells me you're using it wrong.
[10:10:19] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: i guess :s
[10:10:35] <Techtony96> doug65536: I tired doing what you said, but it still doesnt work. I have no idea why. http://web.mineplex.com/ServerTracker/Lobby.php
[10:10:36] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi you don't want to modify the templates.
[10:10:57] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi you want to modify what they generate - are you chrome's developer tools or firefox's firebug?
[10:11:04] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: i want to delete the templates after using them so they don't appear on the html
[10:11:11] <Sendoushi> chrome
[10:11:26] <discipolo> hello all! how do i USE variables in jquery? http://pastebin.com/9tAbrMaX
[10:11:54] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi that's... not how that works.
[10:11:59] <duch_kazatel> why are you hiding your templates?
[10:12:15] <doug65536> Techtony96: you didn't do what I said, your selector should be .hastip
[10:12:15] <duch_kazatel> if the general public shouldn't see them, handlebars shouldn't be used.
[10:12:31] <doug65536> Techtony96: dot finds by class name, # finds by id
[10:12:47] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: just to prettify html. not really any reason
[10:13:15] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi then don't do it.  generated markup is always ugly :)  deleting it kind of ruins part of the point.
[10:13:25] <doug65536> Techtony96: rest looks correct
[10:13:35] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: i don't see why ruins the point...
[10:13:38] <Techtony96> doug65536: Im still learning, what do i need to change?
[10:13:50] <Tomashe> anyone have any idea why my slider is lagging www.lasso.co.il/mobile/ (click on the top arrow) and in that website www.d.co.il the slider works perfectly. any addition , how they disabled the screen movement while draging..
[10:13:56] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi you're trying to delete handlebars templates...
[10:14:00] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make any sense.
[10:14:09] <doug65536> Techtony96: the $('#hastip" is wrong, needs to be $('.hastip')
[10:14:19] <doug65536> Techtony96: line 13
[10:14:22] <duch_kazatel> if you want pretty markup, don't use handlebars/
[10:14:24] <Sendoushi> so... i use the templates after i use them, on the end of the file i delete all the scripts for the templating since they won't be used again
[10:14:32] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel is that so... wrong?
[10:14:43] <Sendoushi> templates are already used... won't be used again
[10:14:44] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi that's really convulutied and strange.
[10:14:44] <doug65536> Techtony96: $('#hastip').powerTip({   <-- wrong, needs to be $('.hastip....
[10:14:58] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi you're adding in an extra step to unnecessarily delete them.
[10:15:06] <Sendoushi> just didn't want the {{}} and scripts laying around in the html
[10:15:17] <Sendoushi> well... maybe... i could not do anything yes duch_kazatel
[10:15:19] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi that's a really strange concern to have.
[10:15:26] <Sendoushi> well maybe a little :D
[10:15:30] <doug65536> Techtony96: if it still doesn't work, I know why
[10:15:32] <Techtony96> doug65536: Ok, it should be fixed
[10:15:32] <duch_kazatel> Sendoushi are you working on this project alone?
[10:15:40] <Sendoushi> duch_kazatel: i am
[10:15:41] <duch_kazatel> or is this something with a team?
[10:15:48] <Techtony96> doug65536:  still doesnt display the names
[10:16:40] <cdehaan> Hello! I'm having a problem where my code within a $.getJSON() isn't being called: $.getJSON('http://localhost:8888/research_images/_images_list.json', { }, function(data) { 				console.log("Got Here"); 			});
[10:16:41] <cdehaan> Any ideas?
[10:16:49] <doug65536> Techtony96: replace that whole script section with http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2XTFT/
[10:17:22] <Techtony96> doug65536: THANK YOU SO MUCH
[10:17:25] <doug65536> Techtony96: that change will run the code after all the elements exist
[10:17:31] <doug65536> Techtony96: np
[10:17:51] <doug65536> Techtony96: looks cool
[10:18:00] <Techtony96> now to do it to the rest of my scripts
[10:18:06] <Techtony96> Main page: Mineplex.com/servers
[10:20:55] <Techtony96> on that main page, i am using iFrames, Is there a way to automatically set the height?
[10:22:26] <doug65536> Techtony96: the iframe needs to be in the same domain as the page to be able to access it
[10:22:48] <doug65536> Techtony96: browser security model prevents you from "reaching into" an iframe from another domain
[10:23:37] <doug65536> Techtony96: the page is in mineplex.com and the iframe is in web.mineplex.com. that causes a problem
[10:23:45] <Techtony96> I host PHP scripts on my dedi server, and then use iFrames to display them on my enjin website. I can't change the size of the iframe?
[10:24:20] <doug65536> Techtony96: sure you can - but you cant go digging inside it for the inner document's height
[10:24:48] <doug65536> Techtony96: is the web. subdomain necessary? that's causing your problem
[10:25:28] <Techtony96> The Website is hosted by Enjin, (Mineplex.com) and the Web.Mineplex.com is a dedicated server with php on it.
[10:25:34] <Techtony96> Enjin doesnt support PHP
[10:26:08] <doug65536> Techtony96: you could do some tricks in php to fix that
[10:26:46] <Techtony96> doug65536: Can you please show me :)
[10:27:40] <doug65536> Techtony96:  you can write a php file that takes a url as a parameter. the server fetches the page and resends it
[10:28:10] <doug65536> Techtony96: wait, which domain do you control?
[10:28:16] <Techtony96> Web.Mineplex.com
[10:28:36] <Techtony96> I can do anything on web.mineplex.com
[10:28:54] <Techtony96> Enjin (Mineplex.com) does not support PHP
[10:29:12] <Techtony96> which is why i am being forced to use an iframe
[10:29:58] <doug65536> Techtony96: you have no control over the mineplex.com page?
[10:30:54] <Techtony96> Are you familiar with Enjin? They are a website company with prebuilt modules. Want a website login? Drop it on a page. Twitter feed? Drop it on in
[10:31:18] <Techtony96> Website Shop? Click add. Add your items/prices. People can buy things from you now
[10:31:23] <doug65536> Techtony96: that doesn't answer the question though
[10:31:39] <Techtony96> doug65536: Yes i have control anything html based i can add to that page
[10:31:52] <Techtony96> Along with files
[10:32:22] <doug65536> Techtony96: then do your php stuff as ajax requests to your php and put those avatar icons in the mineplex.com page
[10:32:57] <doug65536> Techtony96: you can configure php to send a header that makes cross-domain ok from mineplex.com
[10:33:04] <Techtony96> i have never heard of ajax before.
[10:33:27] <doug65536> Techtony96: it's a way for your javascript to fetch data from a url
[10:33:36] <Techtony96> ok.
[10:34:43] <IndianaTux> Hi anyone available for help with function deferal? My code is: http://jsbin.com/uyuvOfO/2/edit?js,output  When executed, it runs what is in the then before I get a return from the ajax call.
[10:34:43] <Techtony96> doug65536: This? http://pastie.org/8250808
[10:35:18] <doug65536> replace the iframe with div, give it some id, then in javascript, put $('#some_id').load('http://web.mineplex.com/lobby.php')
[10:35:50] <doug65536> then in php, put header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://mineplex.com')
[10:36:24] <doug65536> Techtony96: you probably also want to put ' body' at the end of the load url
[10:36:46] <doug65536> Techtony96: and pull the appropriate jquery and plugins into the main page
[10:37:31] <doug65536> Techtony96: yes that, but replace www.some-site  with   mineplex
[10:39:42] <doug65536> Techtony96: iframes are used for malicious stuff, so they are horribly restricted when you go across domains
[10:40:50] <Techtony96> This is the Mineplex.com side: http://pastie.org/private/sewwfz3c02qh95do0tewtq
[10:40:54] <Techtony96> Is that right doug65536 ?
[10:41:32] <doug65536> Techtony96: top part makes sense.... bottom part is wrong... 1 sec
[10:41:41] <Techtony96> ok thankd
[10:41:44] <Techtony96> thanks*
[10:44:23] <doug65536> Techtony96: more like this: http://pastie.org/8250833
[10:45:12] <doug65536> Techtony96: each of those php files need the header thing
[10:45:20] <Techtony96> ah ok. And then on the php scripts, add "header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://mineplex.com');"\
[10:45:26] <doug65536> yes
[10:45:27] <Techtony96> Without the \
[10:45:46] <doug65536> put the header call before any page output
[10:46:29] <Techtony96> i just put it after the CSS/JS links
[10:46:52] <doug65536> Techtony96: the header call MUST happen before ANY page output. put it at the very beginning of the php to be safe
[10:48:02] <Techtony96> doug65536: OK, its on the very first line on each
[10:48:12] <doug65536> <?php ... stuff ... ?>  <h1>Hey people!!!</h2>  <?php  header('TOO LATE!!!'); ?>
[10:50:06] <Techtony96> doug65536:  http://puu.sh/45ICZ.png
[10:50:10] <Croves> It is ok to use $.ajax inside other $.ajax function?
[10:50:14] <Techtony96> Thats how the Lobby looks
[10:50:21] <Techtony96> the first part anyways
[10:50:48] <doug65536> Techtony96: looks good
[10:51:33] <doug65536> Techtony96: put the .load stuff I mentioned in pastie before the $('.hastip'... thing
[10:52:47] <doug65536> Techtony96: actually, it's a bit trickier than that... the .load will return before they finish
[10:53:22] <doug65536> Croves: yes, in the complete handler, sure
[10:53:35] <Croves> lh nice doug65536
[10:53:38] <Croves> thank you
[10:54:31] <Techtony96> I put the $('#some_id').load('http://web.mineplex.com/Lobby.php') in both the mineplex.com and web.mineplex.com pages?
[10:54:41] <doug65536> Techtony96: no
[10:55:23] <doug65536> Techtony96: you really don't have to change the php except that header thing
[10:55:40] <doug65536> Techtony96: ah I see,,,
[10:55:57] <doug65536> Techtony96: yes the php is fine like that without .load
[10:56:05] <doug65536> Techtony96: I got mixed up on which page was which
[10:56:08] <Techtony96> ok
[10:56:22] <doug65536> Techtony96: .load goes in the mineplex.com page
[10:56:46] <Techtony96> which is what you sent me in that pastie
[10:56:51] <doug65536> Techtony96: yes
[10:57:51] <Techtony96> so do we need to delay it loading?
[10:58:13] <doug65536> Techtony96: I don't see any need for delay
[10:58:15] <doug65536> Techtony96: why?
[10:58:27] <Techtony96> Well Mineplex.com/servers isnt loading anything
[10:58:35] <doug65536> Techtony96: you updated it?
[10:58:49] <Techtony96> With the code from the pastie Yes
[10:59:05] <doug65536> I'll have a look
[10:59:50] <doug65536> Techtony96: did you upload the updated php files to the server?
[10:59:58] <Techtony96> Yes
[11:00:18] <doug65536> Techtony96: I don't see the header in the responses
[11:00:39] <doug65536> Techtony96: can you look at php server error log?
[11:00:54] <doug65536> tech
[11:00:58] <Techtony96> Yea, let me find it
[11:00:59] <doug65536> I see, 404 not found
[11:01:07] <doug65536> http://web.mineplex.com/Arcade.php doesn't exist
[11:01:14] <Techtony96> On which page?
[11:01:23] <doug65536> I probably didn't put correct urls in pastie
[11:01:55] <doug65536> http://web.mineplex.com/??????/Arcade.php doesn't exist
[11:02:11] <Techtony96> Oh wow, i didnt check that
[11:02:18] <Techtony96> its /ServerTracker/Arcade.php
[11:02:55] <Techtony96> but it still shows nothing.
[11:04:21] <doug65536> X-CSRF-Token is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers... let me have a look at what that means
[11:04:53] <Techtony96> ok
[11:05:49] <savid> Is it possible to animate an element using a CSS class? For example, I have a css rule with various box-shadow properties, and I want to fade that css class in
[11:06:35] <doug65536> savid: lookup css transition
[11:07:03] <Techtony96> Doug, im starving, i have to go get something to eat, i will be back in 20 minutes. Thanks for all the help so far!
[11:07:12] <doug65536> Techtony96: ok
[11:09:32] <brettfrable> hey guys
[11:09:39] <brettfrable> i have a search box in concrete5 cms
[11:09:50] <brettfrable> how do i use ajax to get the results and load them into an elemetn
[11:10:28] <doug65536> brettfrable: there are many ways. you want to load a chunk of html as ajax? or as raw json data?
[11:11:14] <doug65536> s/as ajax/with ajax/
[11:11:19] <brettfrable> want to load the results from the search using ajax into an element on the page
[11:11:22] <brettfrable> to avoid page refresh
[11:11:26] <brettfrable> preferable as html
[11:11:28] <brettfrable> not as json
[11:11:33] <doug65536> brettfrable: use .load
[11:11:35] <becom33> I'm not sure what Im trying look for . what I want to do a add a loading animation in front the web page while the web page loads in the behind .
[11:11:49] <becom33> can anyone give me a lead to a link where I get a idea of that ?
[11:12:05] <doug65536> brettfrable: $('#some_result_div').load('some_search_url.php body')
[11:12:16] <brettfrable> hm
[11:12:18] <brettfrable> welll
[11:12:23] <tomivs> Hi
[11:12:24] <brettfrable> i can do it fine with content
[11:12:28] <brettfrable> from other pages
[11:12:33] <tomivs> Any suggestions for my website? http://tomivs.tk/
[11:12:35] <brettfrable> but that doesn't work for a get request
[11:12:47] <doug65536> brettfrable: you are contradicting yourself. you said as html
[11:13:06] <brettfrable> if someone types something into the search bar
[11:13:09] <brettfrable> and clicks submit
[11:13:18] <brettfrable> that's considered a get request
[11:13:20] <brettfrable> correct?
[11:13:23] <brettfrable> or can i do that with load?
[11:13:43] <doug65536> brettfrable: what I said means, "hey jquery, go fetch some_search_url.php using ajax, extract the <body> element content, and put it into #some_result_div
[11:14:03] <brettfrable> well
[11:14:10] <brettfrable> i need it to match what they're searching for
[11:14:28] <brettfrable> what i have so far
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> $('sem-search-submit').live("submit",function(){
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> 	
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> 	    var toLoad = $(this).attr('action')+' #business-grid';
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> 	
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> 	    $('#business-grid').hide("normal",loadContent);
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> 	    $('#load').remove();
[11:14:29] <brettfrable> 	    $('h2.title').append('<span id="load">LOADING...</span>');
[11:14:30] <brettfrable> 	    $('#load').fadeIn('normal');
[11:14:30] <brettfrable> 	
[11:14:32] <brettfrable> 	    window.location.hash = $(this).attr('action').substr(0,$(this).attr('action').length-5);
[11:14:32] <brettfrable> 	    function loadContent() {
[11:14:32] <brettfrable> 	        $('#business-grid').load(toLoad,'',showNewContent);
[11:14:32] <brettfrable> 	    }
[11:14:34] <brettfrable> sorry
[11:14:35] <brettfrable> let me pastie
[11:14:38] <snover> …
[11:15:21] <brettfrable> http://jsfiddle.net/ymWg7/1/
[11:16:20] <becom33> anyone for me ?
[11:16:20] <doug65536> brettfrable: .live is obsolete
[11:16:31] <brettfrable> I'm using migrate
[11:16:57] <brettfrable> I'm more concerned with how to accomplush
[11:17:03] <brettfrable> then will worry about best practice
[11:17:19] <doug65536> brettfrable: I'm worried about instant crash of script
[11:17:31] <brettfrable> wont.
[11:17:37] <brettfrable> used it before.
[11:18:06] <doug65536> brettfrable: $('sem-search-submit') is not a valid selector
[11:18:16] <doug65536> brettfrable: there is no sem-search-submit html tag
[11:18:25] <brettfrable> ahhh
[11:18:29] <brettfrable> thanks.
[11:18:40] <brettfrable> should it work otherwise
[11:19:11] <brettfrable> nope/.
[11:19:38] <doug65536> brettfrable: seems roughly correct
[11:19:54] <doug65536> brettfrable: what does console show?
[11:20:40] <brettfrable> nothing
[11:20:44] <brettfrable> getting a page refresh
[11:21:20] <Techtony96> doug65536: OK im back. Before i left, you said something about CSS, i can just host that on Mineplex.com if i need to
[11:21:30] <doug65536> brettfrable: your submit handler is probably crashing... try http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ymWg7/6/
[11:21:40] <doug65536> brettfrable: added preventdefault stuff
[11:22:28] <doug65536> brettfrable: console doesn't show any exceptions happening?
[11:22:54] <brettfrable> getting a 404 error on a get request
[11:23:47] <doug65536> brettfrable: #businessgrid represents the piece of the response you want to extract?
[11:24:01] <doug65536> brettfrable: put a space before it
[11:24:05] <brettfrable> yes
[11:24:05] <brettfrable> it's loading into business grid
[11:24:06] <doug65536> brettfrable: oh, there is
[11:24:19] <brettfrable> http://thecommunikey.com.s164246.gridserver.com/
[11:24:24] <brettfrable> if you click the use your card box
[11:24:28] <brettfrable> theres a search
[11:24:35] <brettfrable> maybe you can identify something in console i cant
[11:27:38] <doug65536> brettfrable: where is the submit handler? which file?
[11:28:13] <jwmann> Right now I'm animating a width based on a percentage.. How do I check the current width percentage? Methods '.width()' and .css('width') give me exact pixel values..
[11:28:39] <becom33> hmm anyone for me ?
[11:28:41] <becom33> I'm not sure what Im trying look for . what I want to do a add a loading animation in front the web page while the web page loads in the behind .
[11:28:45] <Croves> Is there something wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/Y0mkGNme
[11:28:56] <Croves> FIrebug say: TypeError: e is undefined
[11:32:25] <doug65536> brettfrable: I can probably step through it and figure it out if I knew where you put the submit handler
[11:32:42] <brettfrable> what do you mean
[11:32:43] <doug65536> brettfrable: some plugin is spamming setTimeout so I can't use pause
[11:33:02] <doug65536> brettfrable: where is .live... code
[11:33:17] <doug65536> which file
[11:35:21] <doug65536> brettfrable: I found it
[11:35:45] <doug65536> brettfrable: $('.sem-search-form').on("submit",function(event){   ?
[11:35:52] <doug65536> I don't thing the event is attached
[11:35:59] <doug65536> it doesn't break into debugger
[11:36:19] <doug65536> brettfrable: it is just doing plain submit with no js code execution
[11:36:28] <brettfrable> so what do i do here
[11:37:12] <doug65536> brettfrable: ok, now it broke in...
[11:37:33] <doug65536> brettfrable: $(this).attr('.sem-search-input')  <-- that's nonsense
[11:37:43] <doug65536> undefined #businesscard
[11:38:12] <doug65536> brettfrable: should be .attr('action')
[11:38:59] <Techtony96> doug65536: Before i left, you said something about CSS, i can just host that on Mineplex.com if i need to
[11:39:12] <brettfrable> that gets me half watt there
[11:39:17] <brettfrable> but doesn't query the dearch
[11:39:19] <brettfrable> search
[11:39:23] <brettfrable> way*
[11:39:57] <doug65536> you never call loadContent()
[11:40:19] <doug65536> brettfrable: ^
[11:41:26] <doug65536> brettfrable: none of those functions there are executed
[11:41:45] <brettfrable> yes they are
[11:41:49] <doug65536> brettfrable: where
[11:42:05] <doug65536> brettfrable: oh I see
[11:42:10] <doug65536> brettfrable: when hide finishes?
[11:42:18] <brettfrable> yes
[11:43:03] <doug65536> brettfrable: well, it works momentarily, then the pictures come back up
[11:43:11] <brettfrable> yeah
[11:43:23] <brettfrable> because the search isn't working
[11:43:28] <doug65536> it is working
[11:43:28] <RobW_> I'm looking to do a quick and dirty infinite scroll on a prototype I'm building. Using jQuery 2.0, which isn't supported by the Paul Irish plugin. Any suggestions?
[11:43:30] <brettfrable> it's acting as if I'm not searching for anything
[11:43:38] <brettfrable> so it's not getting the search value
[11:43:49] <doug65536> some plugin is spamming setTieout and doing something stupid
[11:44:45] <boytoy> RobW_: i use https://github.com/kpheasey/jqm.infinitescroll
[11:45:26] <boytoy> paul irish is too busy living the good life i reckon =)
[11:45:31] <RobW_> boytoy: requires jq mobile as well?
[11:46:06] <boytoy> RobW_: yeah im a big fan of the whole mobile first philosophy
[11:46:39] <RobW_> Thanks, looking at it now.
[11:47:15] <doug65536> brettfrable: where do the search terms get into the ajax request?
[11:48:14] <doug65536> brettfrable: .load won't magically put the form fields into the request
[11:48:21] <brettfrable> yeah
[11:48:23] <brettfrable> thats where I'm lost
[11:49:18] <doug65536> brettfrable:  $('#business-grid').load(toLoad, $('.sem-search-input').val(),showNewContent);
[11:49:57] <doug65536> brettfrable: actually.. no
[11:51:16] <doug65536> brettfrable:  $('#business-grid').load(toLoad,{$('.sem-search-input').attr('name'): $('.sem-search-input').val()},showNewContent);
[11:51:54] <doug65536> brettfrable: and probably the name and text of the search button - I can't see server side code
[11:52:29] <doug65536> Techtony96: did I say something about css?
[11:52:48] <brettfrable> that breaks something
[11:54:22] <doug65536> brettfrable: then try: var data = {}; data[ $('.sem-search-input').attr('name')] =  $('.sem-search-input').val(); $('#business-grid').load(toLoad, data,showNewContent);
[11:56:33] <brettfrable> appreciate your help
[11:56:36] <brettfrable> still not working
[11:56:58] <doug65536> brettfrable: toLoad already has query parameters, that could cause a problem if you also pass a data argument...
[11:59:41] <doug65536> brettfrable: replace var toLoad = $(this).attr('action').match(/^[^?]+/) + ' #businesscard';
[12:00:46] <doug65536> brettfrable: that strips off the ?cid=123423 stuff
[12:01:29] <doug65536> brettfrable: that stuff you are doing to the hash makes url in address bar end with #/index.php?... that could be another bug
[12:02:02] <doug65536> brettfrable: but one that would only make bookmarked search useless
[12:02:46] <doug65536> Techtony96: you need to get a cookie and send it along with request...
[12:02:54] <doug65536> Techtony96: still not 100% sure what's going on there
[12:03:07] <doug65536> Techtony96: it's some cross-site-forgery protection stuff
[12:06:06] <doug65536> brettfrable: I just manually did the query in the address bar
[12:06:26] <doug65536> brettfrable: that form action doesn't search
[12:06:38] <brettfrable> yeah
[12:06:38] <brettfrable> :(
[12:06:38] <brettfrable> anyway to do it with ajax though
[12:06:40] <doug65536> brettfrable: so no matter how perfect your submit handler - it won't
[12:07:03] <doug65536> brettfrable: the search is utterly broken - all the ajax in the world won't fix that
[12:07:16] <brettfrable> not true
[12:07:18] <doug65536> brettfrable: that form doesn't search. period
[12:07:20] <brettfrable> search works without ajax
[12:07:35] <brettfrable> took it out
[12:07:36] <brettfrable> try now
[12:07:38] <brettfrable> searches
[12:07:47] <brettfrable> search
[12:07:48] <brettfrable> food
[12:07:49] <brettfrable> or bates
[12:07:56] <brettfrable> or thai
[12:08:35] <doug65536> brettfrable: did you try it?
[12:09:11] <brettfrable> yes
[12:09:13] <brettfrable> if i search thai
[12:09:18] <brettfrable> it takes me to the hp again
[12:09:24] <brettfrable> then if i click use my card
[12:09:31] <brettfrable> it shows the result for thai
[12:09:35] <brettfrable> so what I'm trying to do
[12:09:58] <brettfrable> is get the content being displayed in #business-grid that is being displayed via the search query
[12:10:37] <doug65536> brettfrable: doesn't work for me. it reloads the page only
[12:10:58] <doug65536> brettfrable: then if I click use my card (why would a user do that?) it shows stuff like pizza etc - random default stuff
[12:11:51] <doug65536> brettfrable: right?
[12:12:19] <doug65536> brettfrable: ok now I see, those huge pictures are the search results?
[12:12:29] <brettfrable> yes!
[12:12:41] <brettfrable> i think you're missing the point
[12:12:46] <brettfrable> the point isn't for the page to refresh
[12:12:50] <brettfrable> that is why i was trying to use ajax
[12:12:54] <brettfrable> to display that data
[12:13:07] <doug65536> ok, put the submit handler back
[12:13:17] <brettfrable> and replace the content in business grid with the content from the search
[12:13:28] <doug65536> brettfrable: it almost works
[12:13:43] <brettfrable> i put it back
[12:13:50] <doug65536> there must be hidden fields search needs...
[12:14:29] <doug65536> yes I think I know what's going on...
[12:15:29] <doug65536> get rid of that whole " var data " thing I mentioned earlier and replace it with var data = $('.sem-search-form').serialize()
[12:18:56] <doug65536> brettfrable: once that works, you'd need to fix those 1 2 3 links at the bottom
[12:24:07] <doug65536> brettfrable: are you doing that ?
[12:24:34] <doug65536> brettfrable: I'm starting to think you're ignoring me now
[12:24:50] <doug65536> brettfrable: good luck
[12:25:01] <brettfrable> no sorry on the phone
[12:26:49] <c4ptnh00k> trying to get the value of a input from a dynamically added input. http://jsfiddle.net/qwXep/   If you click add Location and type some stuff into the first text box and press add address an alert should display the contents of first input. Can anyone help me figure out how to get it to work?
[12:29:37] <brettfrable> got it!

[12:33:56] <c4ptnh00k> lol we got the same place the same time
[12:34:02] <c4ptnh00k> thanks for the help
[12:34:10] <seutje> c4ptnh00k: parents grabs all parents and filters those with the selector you passed, but none of the parents matches that selector
[12:34:45] <seutje> c4ptnh00k: so either take the right part out of the parents and put it in a find, or even better: do the same thing with closest
[12:35:06] <c4ptnh00k> i like closest
[12:35:11] <seutje> c4ptnh00k: heh yeah, xcept that space in your is tripping up my ocd
[12:35:16] <seutje> yours*
[12:35:57] <brettfrable> doug65536 ya there
[12:36:07] <c4ptnh00k> seutje: honestly the remenants of a bad drag and drop :(
[12:36:57] <seutje> c4ptnh00k: isn't drag and drop inherently bad? :P
[12:37:17] <seutje> it sells though
[12:37:39] <seutje> drag and drop html5 carousels with social media integration, and preferably in 3d
[12:37:42] <c4ptnh00k> seutje: lol im lazy
[12:38:09] <seutje> c4ptnh00k: it's ok, it's one of the 3 virtues :P
[12:38:50] <Imaginativeone> Can I ignore the HTML DOM and just work with my custom XML tree?
[12:39:09] <c4ptnh00k> seutje: :P
[12:40:11] <lethjakman> is there a good way to convert a field to a text_area when I click on it and convert it back to plain text when it's not selected?
[12:40:50] <seutje> textareas are plain text
[12:41:20] <seutje> think linebreaks are automatically ignored
[12:43:13] <seutje> lethjakman: yup: http://jsfiddle.net/XM22t/
[12:43:22] <Imaginativeone> lethjakman: are you talking about toggling an enabled state?
[12:44:01] <seutje> oh, I thought text input <-> textarea
[12:44:12] <cm710> Hi! Can anybody please tell me how can I find out where exactly is the on('click', function...) of a html element called when that html element is clicked on a webpage?
[12:44:25] <lethjakman> Imaginativeone: perhaps? there's a lot about frontend I don't know. I want it to appear as a <p> until I click it when I want it to appear as a <textarea>
[12:44:28] <seutje> cm710: what do u mean where?
[12:44:33] <seutje> like the scope?
[12:44:44] <lethjakman> seutje: I don't think that's what I want? it's always a text field
[12:44:48] <lethjakman> I'm thinking like Jira has.
[12:44:51] <seutje> or like, geographically? o.O
[12:45:05] <seutje> lethjakman: aren't those text areas?
[12:45:20] <seutje> or do u mean like contenteditable?
[12:45:34] <seutje> like edit a live element
[12:45:40] <seutje> albeit just a styled div
[12:45:57] <Imaginativeone> Yes, you want to toggle an enabled state.
[12:46:21] <cm710> seutje: well, when I click a button I would like to see if there's a on('click', ...) method associated with it so I know what happens there by setting a breakpoint or something.
[12:47:04] <seutje> cm710: with chrome you can set arbitrary event break points
[12:47:13] <jwmann> I need to run a function after the method addClass() finishes, how would I accomplish this?
[12:47:22] <seutje> like tell it to "stop when a click handler is firing and show me where"
[12:47:23] <lethjakman> Imaginativeone: how does that look?
[12:47:37] <seutje> cm710: but that will just point you to jQuery's internal event handling
[12:47:55] <Imaginativeone> Sorry, can't see it on my iPhone
[12:48:08] <seutje> cm710: you probably want $._data(elementReference, 'events')
[12:48:19] <cm710> seutje: Yeah, I tried to use that by setting breakpoints whenever clicks are made, but it just pointed to the jquery file
[12:48:22] <lethjakman> seutje: I mean make it look like it's a <p> tag when it's not selected and make it look like a <textarea> when it is. as in not have a border and to act as if it isn't editable.
[12:48:22] <Imaginativeone> jwmann: That is called a "callback"
[12:48:26] <seutje> cm710: but with .on it might actually be bound higher up and delegated
[12:48:45] <jwmann> Imaginativeone: Yes, but the addClass method doesn't support a callback.
[12:48:56] <seutje> cm710: so be sure to check $._data(document.body, 'events')
[12:49:16] <cm710> seutje: I'll try what you said; thank you for the info.
[12:49:39] <seutje> lethjakman: so like contenteditable, and some css to make it look like a textfield? or a textfield that's disabled and looks like a regular paragraph?
[12:49:46] <seutje> lethjakman: your choice
[12:50:02] <seutje> lethjakman: but note that contenteditable allows for styling that's annoying to block
[12:50:14] <lethjakman> seutje: the second one sounds like what I want.
[12:50:21] <seutje> and contenteditable isn't very consistent across the board
[12:50:38] <lethjakman> definitely the second one then.
[12:50:41] <Imaginativeone> jwmann: api.jquery.com/addClass
[12:50:50] <seutje> lethjakman: think you just have to strip border, background and padding then
[12:50:56] <seutje> and perhaps make it inline
[12:50:59] <jwmann> Imaginativeone: I read this page before coming here.
[12:51:06] <seutje> should look pretty much like a regular paragraph then
[12:51:06] <lethjakman> seutje: ahh interesting, I'll give that a shot. thank you.
[12:51:09] <EHLOVader> Good evening everyone....
[12:51:10] <Imaginativeone> Third example
[12:51:20] <lethjakman> I could do that with an addclass.
[12:51:58] <Imaginativeone> you mean without?
[12:52:05] <EHLOVader> had a question about jquery ui and handling .after on the widgets.  Is there a way to determine that an input isn't the "input"s outer most element?
[12:52:10] <seutje> lethjakman: well, I would suggest just toggling the disabled attribute
[12:52:28] <seutje> lethjakman: you can have your CSS target input[type="text"][disabled]
[12:52:29] <lethjakman> seutje: why that over toggling a class?
[12:52:30] <EHLOVader> I found that common validation scripts will tear right into the middle of spinners, date fields, etc
[12:52:41] <lethjakman> ahh
[12:52:43] <seutje> cause you have to disable it anyway, right?
[12:52:53] <seutje> might as well use that as your class
[12:52:59] <seutje> it's supported back to the stone-age anyway
[12:53:15] <Imaginativeone> jwmann: It has been available 1.4+
[12:53:30] <lethjakman> seutje: perfect, thank you.
[12:53:41] <Techtony96> doug65536: are you there?
[12:54:31] <seutje> Imaginativeone: the callback is to generate a list of classes
[12:54:40] <seutje> not to run after the class was injected
[12:54:48] <Imaginativeone> Ugh
[12:54:52] <Imaginativeone> Sorry
[12:55:04] <seutje> jwmann: generally, you can assume the next line being run, the class has been injected
[12:55:28] <seutje> jwmann: when all else fails, you can use the face that pretty much everything is a deferred object nowadays
[12:55:51] <jwmann> Imaginativeone: That function is not for callbacks, that is for advanced configuration of the addClass method, it requires that you return a string, you can't perform actions after the return
[12:55:54] <seutje> so like $.when( $foo.addClass('bar') ).then(callback);
[12:56:15] <seutje> but don't abuse this, in most cases it's overkill
[12:56:35] <jwmann> seutje: Interesting, could you link me to a doc page for that?
[12:56:41] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[12:56:46] <jwmann> Thank you!
[12:57:10] <seutje> when turns it into a deferred I guess
[12:57:24] <seutje> I'm still hazy on the exact terminology myself
[13:01:14] <doug65536> Techtony96: yes
[13:02:49] <Techtony96> doug65536: I realized you sent that css comment to someone else
[13:03:12] <Techtony96> doug65536: Mineplex.com/servers still doesnt show correctly though :(
[13:03:57] <ernston> hello
[13:05:42] <ernston> Whirl3d are you here?
[13:07:13] <doug65536> Techtony96: let me see if I can figure out this X-CSRF-Token
[13:07:50] <Techtony96> thanks
[13:27:53] <jwmann> How do I reference the object captured using $.when().done() ?
[13:30:04] <smallfoot> $(elem).toggleClass('on off'); is supposed to alternate between on and off?
[13:31:09] <ChineseCockBuffe> hi
[13:31:17] <EHLOVader> ok, to add to what I asked earlier.. I think this will work. .parents('.ui-widget') is that effective to return the widget outer container if it exists... otherwise I could use the .after on the element?
[13:32:35] <ChineseCockBuffe> The Chinese Cock Buffet is currently closed.
[13:58:48] <samholmes> Is there a way to add elements to jQuery object?
[13:59:00] <samholmes> Effecting the object, not just returning one
[14:08:40] <plambwk> quick question
[14:08:47] <plambwk> how can i manipulate the JS on this
[14:08:49] <plambwk> http://jsfiddle.net/8kN6Z/33/
[14:08:55] <plambwk> so it doesn't play the video on page load
[14:11:07] <plambwk> if i remove
[14:11:08] <plambwk> event.target.playVideo();
[14:11:13] <plambwk> the play button doesnt work anymore
[14:12:46] <plambwk> nevermind
[14:21:32] <guideX> is there another way to hide a table, besides hide and show?
[14:21:43] <guideX> when I .show(), my table dimensions are all screwed up
[14:21:54] <guideX> but if I don't hide in the beginning, there's a little flicker/jump
[14:38:17] <JFranks> I'm sitting here staring at an image in WP that is wrapped in an <a> that loads up the full-sized version of the image in a new tab when clicked.. Couldn't I have it place the larger version of the image onto the page, anchored by the top-left corner, when someone hovers?
[14:39:24] <ernston> Whirl3d ?
[14:53:22] <doug65536> plambwk: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8kN6Z/243/ autoplay=0 should work
[14:53:43] <doug65536> plambwk: the code plays it
[14:54:00] <doug65536> plambwk: line 10
[14:54:59] <doug65536> plambwk: ah, I couldn't see your last message in all the join/part spam
[14:56:06] <doug65536> Techtony96: you still there?
[14:56:15] <Techtony96> doug65536:  yup
[14:56:31] <doug65536> Techtony96: give me a link to your site again?
[14:56:35] <doug65536> I closed all my browsers
[14:56:39] <doug65536> it was getting ridiculous
[14:56:40] <doug65536> :)
[14:56:53] <Techtony96> lol, web.mineplex.com/ServerTracker
[14:56:57] <Techtony96> and Mineplex.com/servers
[14:57:29] <Techtony96> that web one with just ServerTracker is a html page i put together with it autosizing everything
[14:57:32] <doug65536> Techtony96: this is 99% done...
[14:57:39] <Techtony96> Awesome :D
[14:57:46] <doug65536> some goofy security feature is causing the problem
[14:58:00] <Techtony96> Do you know which one?
[14:58:10] <doug65536> CSRF
[14:58:18] <doug65536> cross site request forgery
[14:58:55] <Techtony96> ok
[14:59:52] <mobile8> hi, i have some <button> that has a data-href="http://www.domain.com" how can I make sure that this link gets opened?
[15:00:56] <mike_f> I have a quick question about jqueryui with regard to draggable: how can I drag a *relatively positioned* element off of its container onto some other container in the window?
[15:01:28] <mike_f> I assume that absolute positioning may help me, but in the end I want that draggable back in its corner. :)
[15:02:11] <doug65536> mike_f: is the container "overflow: hidden"
[15:04:38] <mike_f> My container is scrollable.
[15:04:41] <mike_f> So I think so.
[15:05:30] <doug65536> mike_f: that's probably the real problem - the coordinate system of the position is not what is important
[15:05:46] <JFranks> Sort-of a one liner.. http://jsbin.com/uWibOLE/1/edit?html,js,output
[15:06:01] <mike_f> I'm trying to make it so that I can drag a marker from a jqueryui panel off onto some place else.
[15:06:32] <mike_f> In this case, I have a mapping application filling the window, with a number of panels that can appear on top of it.
[15:07:12] <mike_f> My dragging appears constrained to the panel which contained the icon to begin with.
[15:07:16] <JFranks> I just need a bit more code to say "if 'src' attr contains 'imgur.com' then swap the 's.html' for '.html'"
[15:12:05] <mike_f> Hrm. Perhaps the documentation answers my question. I think I need to set the appendTo from its default of 'parent' to 'window' or my root 'map_container'...
[15:14:50] <doug65536> JFranks: aw, zero length lookbehind assertions aren't supported in js?
[15:16:11] <doug65536> JFranks: that makes replace next to useless
[15:16:26] <duch_kazatel> doug65536 - nope, they don't :(
[15:16:26] <duch_kazatel> http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html
[15:27:30] <doug65536> Techtony96: do you have csrf_token somewhere in your php?
[15:27:48] <Techtony96> doug65536: No
[15:29:55] <doug65536> Techtony96: what I don't understand is why csrf_token is empty in your page
[15:30:14] <Techtony96> Do you want to see my original php?
[15:30:34] <doug65536> Techtony96: where did this come from: var csrf_token = '';
[15:30:48] <Techtony96> Which page?
[15:30:48] <doug65536> in the mineplex.com page
[15:30:57] <doug65536>  /servers
[15:31:32] <Techtony96> Enjin must have done that.
[15:34:14] <doug65536> Techtony96: try this:
[15:34:30] <doug65536> Techtony96: after that header line, put header('X-CSRF-Token: ');
[15:36:25] <Techtony96> Beginning of my code: http://puu.sh/45W2n.png
[15:36:28] <Techtony96> I did it on all 3
[15:36:46] <doug65536> Techtony96: uploaded ?
[15:37:27] <Techtony96> doug65536:  Yes
[15:59:05] <doug65536> Techtony96: replace that second headers line with header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: accept, x-request-source, x-csrf-token, access-control-allow-headers, origin');
[16:00:30] <Techtony96> doug65536:  Ok updated
[16:01:13] <doug65536> Techtony96: I think that did it!
[16:01:20] <doug65536> Techtony96: now, to see why it isn't visible
[16:03:29] <doug65536> Techtony96: it is showing all the little icons for the people in the network pane...
[16:03:33] <doug65536> so it is working to some extent
[16:03:59] <Techtony96> on the Mineplex.com/servers it doesnt show anything for me
[16:04:17] <doug65536> yes I know... but it fetches all those icons
[16:04:54] <doug65536> and there are no errors now
[16:09:12] <doug65536> Techtony96: it is soooo close to working, try $.ajax({
[16:09:12] <doug65536>  url:'http://web.mineplex.com/ServerTracker/Lobby.php',
[16:09:12] <doug65536>  complete: function(d) {
[16:09:12] <doug65536>   d.done(function(e) {
[16:09:12] <doug65536>    console.log(e);
[16:09:13] <doug65536>   });
[16:09:15] <doug65536>  }
[16:09:17] <doug65536> });
[16:09:21] <doug65536> oops
[16:10:22] <doug65536> Techtony96: 1 sec
[16:10:31] <Techtony96> ok
[16:12:17] <doug65536> Techtony96: ok now we have a slightly different problem, but easily solved
[16:12:55] <doug65536> can you show the php page again?
[16:13:47] <doug65536> Techtony96:  $('#lobby').load('http://web.mineplex.com/ServerTracker/Lobby.php')   works
[16:13:58] <doug65536> however, you use relative paths for jquery and stuff
[16:15:37] <Techtony96> sorry, my internet went out for a second, going to dinner
[16:15:40] <doug65536> Techtony96: use this for the src for jquery //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js
[16:25:05] <PoliteSpite> I apologize if this is a simple question, I've done some Googling, but haven't found a conclusive answer. I have a JSON object, I want to open a new window (on the same domain) and use it to parse and display the object. At this point, it seems like my choices are HTML5 local storage, or serializing/Base60 encoding the JSON object then passing it as a url parameter. Is that accurate? Or does
[16:25:05] <PoliteSpite> jQuery offer another option.
[16:25:31] <PoliteSpite> base64*
[16:48:43] <QuanSai> hey
[16:51:52] <QuanSai> http://pastebin.com/jFsLi96H <-- Anyone know why when I click the #collapse div, its containing div slides up and then slides back down?
[16:52:42] <doug65536> QuanSai: $(".job #description").slideUp("slow").end().parent().siblings()  ????
[16:53:08] <QuanSai> doug65536: Is that at all causing the problem?
[16:53:19] <doug65536> QuanSai: what is .end().parent().siblings() there for?
[16:54:02] <QuanSai> doug65536: When I was first writing the code, I saw it in a code sample and I never changed it.  Anyway, I took it out.
[16:54:18] <QuanSai> doug65536: And taking it out has no relevance to my problem, apparently.
[16:54:28] <doug65536> QuanSai: I don't think the .hide() will wait for the slidedown...
[16:54:48] <doug65536> QuanSai: the .parent() doesn't make a lot of sense
[16:54:56] <QuanSai> doug65536: slidedown() works in this context, the way it's supposed to.
[16:54:59] <doug65536> QuanSai: I would have to see a bit of html to understand it
[16:55:09] <QuanSai> doug65536: It's slideUp() that doesn't work.
[16:55:32] <doug65536> QuanSai: after .end() you're back at $(this)
[16:55:36] <doug65536> right?
[16:56:21] <QuanSai> doug65536: What do you mean?
[16:56:23] <doug65536> $("description").hide(); doesn't make sense
[16:56:31] <doug65536> there is no description html tag, right?
[16:56:34] <doug65536> missing . or #
[16:56:39] <QuanSai> Nah, there isn't.
[16:56:50] <doug65536> $("#description").hide(); doesn't make sense
[16:56:58] <doug65536> does make sense
[16:57:01] <doug65536> missing #
[16:57:19] <QuanSai> doug65536: Yeah, I took it out.
[16:57:30] <doug65536> QuanSai: took what out
[16:57:57] <doug65536> QuanSai: sorry I'm being confusing :)
[16:58:05] <talntid> if I want to find all the attributes called "pricing" in a page?
[16:58:15] <tw2113> create a jsfiddle instead of a pastebin
[16:58:18] <QuanSai> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/VYMEHbwP
[16:58:28] <talntid> specifically all the currently selected <options>
[16:58:56] <doug65536> QuanSai: $(this).find("#description")  <-- has no effect. find it then do what?
[16:59:25] <QuanSai> um
[16:59:26] <doug65536> QuanSai: and why would you .find by id anyway? id's must be unique on a page
[16:59:43] <tw2113> at least for validity
[16:59:50] <QuanSai> doug65536: Erroneous paste.
[16:59:53] * tw2113 grumbles at bad code from last night
[16:59:53] <QuanSai> doug65536: Sorry.
[17:00:00] <QuanSai> I'm creating a jsfiddle.
[17:00:05] <doug65536> QuanSai: thanks
[17:02:51] <jleclanche> Anyone knows a good js/jquery lib that adds checkboxes to each row of a table, to make its rows selectable? (a la gmail)
[17:03:40] <doug65536> jleclanche: yeah, there is a library for that, jquery itself :)
[17:03:58] <doug65536> jleclanche: what are you going to do with the checkbox values?
[17:05:01] <jleclanche> doug65536: yeah i could implement my own widget for it. i was more thinking of "enhance table with checkboxes in an additional first cell, provide easy access to each item that was selected in an array"
[17:05:19] <jleclanche> no point reinventing the wheel if something's out there already. i figure its not an uncommon use case
[17:05:21] <doug65536> jleclanche: trivially easy. I'm making a fiddle
[17:05:33] <doug65536> jleclanche: I doubt someone would make a plugin for something that simple
[17:06:02] <jleclanche> doug65536: well i was also thinking of making the table sortable, so perhaps theres some "table enhancement" plugin out there
[17:06:05] <jleclanche> Im losing myself ;)
[17:09:46] <doug65536> jleclanche: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ZGqLW/3/
[17:10:12] <jleclanche> heh thanks, i was already writing one :)
[17:10:56] <talntid> http://jsfiddle.net/FTrra/1/ - can someone assist? I'm looking for the sum of all prices on from the attribute of "price"
[17:14:12] <duch_kazatel> talntid what?  you're trying to add together each value for "price", or the value selected in the dropdown?
[17:16:21] <wiistriker> hi! anybody can help me with jquery ui widget factory?
[17:16:32] <wiistriker> i have few questions about widgets inheritance
[17:18:20] <talntid> duch_kazatel. for each selected <option>, I want to add together the value for "price"
[17:19:37] <Techtony96> doug65536: Hey, your back!
[17:19:53] <doug65536> Techtony96: yes
[17:20:19] <Techtony96> doug65536: My internet went out after you pasted that code, could you paste that again please?
[17:21:03] <QuanSai> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/RmWyW/ <-- See what happens? Click the box.  Don't worry about the video size (it's fine in the real version).  Then click the little black circle. It's supposed to close the box and leave it closed.
[17:22:31] <wiistriker> i want create one abstract widget factory and later extend it
[17:23:04] <QuanSai> doug65536: Any idea?
[17:23:36] <wiistriker> $.widget('ui.abstractWidget', {...});  $.widget('ui.someConcreteWidget', $ui.abstractWidget, { ... });
[17:24:03] <wiistriker> so i want access to abstract method by $('#elem').abstractWidget('someMethod');
[17:24:07] <wiistriker> but i can't
[17:24:36] <doug65536> QuanSai: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RmWyW/1/
[17:24:42] <wiistriker> how this task should be performed in widget factroy?
[17:24:48] <wiistriker> factory*
[17:24:50] <doug65536> QuanSai: the click propagates up the elements, so both clicks fire
[17:24:57] <doug65536> QuanSai: stopPropagation prevents that
[17:25:16] <QuanSai> doug65536: Wow. How the hell would I have known that? Where did you see it? Nothing shows in the console.
[17:25:24] <QuanSai> doug65536: Regardless, you' the man. Thanks.
[17:25:31] <doug65536> QuanSai: because I know how events work in browsers :D
[17:25:46] <QuanSai> So they don't tell you that in any books or something?
[17:25:51] <doug65536> QuanSai: the event goes up the hierarchy
[17:26:17] <doug65536> QuanSai: when an event happens, it happens on that element, and all of its parents
[17:26:39] <doug65536> QuanSai: the click handler can see where the event came from by looking at ev.target
[17:26:52] <doug65536> QuanSai: assuming they name the parameter ev like I did
[17:27:04] <duch_kazatel> talntid - http://jsfiddle.net/FTrra/6/
[17:27:07] <QuanSai> doug65536: So stopPropagation() isolates the event to that element?
[17:27:09] <duch_kazatel> not super clean but you get the idea.
[17:27:18] <doug65536> QuanSai: yes, it stops it from getting to any more parents
[17:27:42] <QuanSai> Nice. See? I need to know things like that. Where'd you learn jQuery and JavaScript?
[17:27:56] <doug65536> QuanSai: on my own
[17:28:04] <duch_kazatel> yaaaay learning!
[17:28:05] <QuanSai> Dammit.
[17:28:11] <duch_kazatel> QuanSai it comes with experience.
[17:28:24] <duch_kazatel> lucky for you evens are one of biggest core concepts to really understand.
[17:28:42] <talntid> http://jsfiddle.net/FTrra/1/ - can someone assist? I'm looking for the sum of all selected <option> prices on from the attribute of "price"
[17:28:53] <QuanSai> I need a good starter book or guide. Something.
[17:29:18] <doug65536> QuanSai: the purpose of it is, say you had a table with 1000 rows and a checkbox on every row. you wouldn't attack 1000 event handlers, you would put one on the table
[17:29:25] <doug65536> attach*
[17:29:44] <QuanSai> doug65536: Yeah, I get it. Thanks a lot.  Now I'm going to do it on everything. :D
[17:30:06] <duch_kazatel> talntid dude i just gave you that code...
[17:30:28] <talntid> whoah duch_kazatel, sorry man. I didn't see it!
[17:30:32] <talntid> I do now. THANKS! =)
[17:30:39] <duch_kazatel> talntid not a problem!
[17:31:02] <talntid> I must be blind :-)
[17:31:13] <duch_kazatel> happens to all of us.
[17:31:51] <talntid> right, blindMoe? :)
[17:36:22] <talntid> duch_kazatel, that appears to be counting based off the value, yes? I was trying to count off the price attr - is that easy?
[17:37:38] <duch_kazatel> yeah, just change it to read off the price attr instead of the text.

[17:41:22] <QuanSai> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/RmWyW/2/ <-- Why can't I have multiple boxes act the same way separately? The circle to collapse the box only works in the first one, and I need to use that first box (the circle within it) to close all of the open boxes.  Any way to fix this?
[17:41:49] <doug65536> QuanSai: duplicate id?
[17:42:01] <doug65536> QuanSai: don't have duplicate ids
[17:42:11] <QuanSai> doug65536: Yeah, but there's an infinite amount of boxes.
[17:42:24] <QuanSai> doug65536: They all need to act separately.
[17:43:23] <doug65536> QuanSai: use .closest('.job').slideUp()
[17:43:59] <QuanSai> doug65536: Alright.
[17:45:05] <doug65536> QuanSai: oh, and use a class for the description
[17:45:06] <QuanSai> doug65536: That closes them all.
[17:45:28] <doug65536> QuanSai: then .closest('.job').find('.description').slideUp()
[17:45:33] <QuanSai> doug65536: A CSS class?
[17:45:43] <doug65536> QuanSai: it doesn't need to be in css, but yes
[17:46:14] <doug65536> QuanSai: you could also use data attribute but class makes most sense for that usage
[17:50:23] <doug65536> QuanSai: .closest finds the closest parent that matches the selector, find searches within that for something with class description. then slide up that. make sense?
[17:50:45] <QuanSai> doug65536: Makes sense, but it's not working.
[17:51:06] <doug65536> I'll brb
[17:52:01] <QuanSai> alright
[18:13:04] <QuanSai> http://jsfiddle.net/RmWyW/2/ <-- Why can't I have multiple boxes act the same way separately? The circle to collapse the box only works in the first one, and I need to use that first box (the circle within it) to close all of the open boxes.  Any way to fix this?
[18:18:02] <doug65536> QuanSai: can you show what you have?
[18:18:13] <QuanSai> doug65536: What do you mean?
[18:18:15] <doug65536> nvm lol
[18:19:41] <QuanSai> doug65536: Well, I showed what's going on inside of the fiddle. Am I doing something wrong?
[18:20:02] <doug65536> QuanSai: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/RmWyW/6/
[18:23:03] <QuanSai>  doug65536: Thanks a lot. You added $(this)
[18:23:21] <doug65536> no
[18:23:42] <doug65536> QuanSai: I told you a long time ago. you can't have duplicate id in the page
[18:23:55] <doug65536> QuanSai: also, I changed description to class
[18:24:21] <doug65536> QuanSai: compare your link above to mine
[18:24:28] <doug65536> I changed more than this
[18:24:40] <QuanSai> doug65536: Yeah, that's what I'm doing. You switched #description to a class.
[18:25:29] <doug65536> yes and the 2nd click handler is using a class instead of an id
[18:26:12] <doug65536> use class to give purpose to things. use id to identify one exact object
[18:27:41] <QuanSai> doug65536: Works! WTF
[18:29:43] <doug65536> lol
[18:31:17] <talntid> duch_kazatel, you still here? :)
[18:35:46] <rashkov> Is there a way to resolve a single promise only after a bunch of other promises have resolved?
[18:37:31] <doug65536> rashkov: you could decrement a counter in each done handler and when it reaches zero, all promises are done
[18:37:57] <doug65536> rashkov: but I don't know the answer to the actual question
[18:38:46] <rashkov> doug65536: thanks doug. Also I'm thinking more about it now, and this might be a good case for $.when().then()
[18:39:01] <dbizzy> anyone know where tinynav.js it tells it where to place the new nav on the page?
[18:39:02] <dbizzy> https://github.com/viljamis/TinyNav.js
[18:40:20] <dbizzy> I want to prepend it to a different element instead of placing the new nav under the current
[18:51:56] <doug65536> rashkov: that's exactly what $.when appears to be for
[18:53:07] <doug65536> rashkov: I wish the deferred stuff was documented better
[18:53:38] <doug65536> rashkov: half of it talks about deferred as though $.ajax etc use it and don't really address your own deferred's
[18:54:37] <doug65536> rashkov: such as the 'type' field. default 'fx'. ok what if it isn't fx, what then? doesn't say afaik
[18:56:45] <rashkov> doug65536: hah! you're right, it says nothing more about the type field.
[18:58:45] <shoky> $.fn.promise() ?
[19:00:06] <shoky> the 'type' field is the name of the queue. if your queued actions are in a different queue other than the default 'fx', set type to that
[19:00:33] <doug65536> shoky: how do I "put my queued actions in another queue"
[19:00:47] <shoky> with .animate() or .queue() for example
[19:02:04] <shoky> and .promise() should only really be used for those
[19:02:16] <shoky> .promise() is not jquery's promises/deferred's API
[19:02:45] <shoky> $.Deferred is.  and deferred.promise()
[19:02:58] <shoky> and well, this http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[19:03:38] <shoky> $.fn.promise() is just a way to wait for the queued animations/whatever via a promise
[19:03:39] <doug65536> what didn't really make a lot of sense about queue was how it is attached to a dom element
[19:04:31] <doug65536> when I attempted to use it for something...
[19:04:37] <shoky> it's a queue that jquery maintains, for each element that you queue stuff on. like when you .animate() stuff it queues the animations on a queue
[19:05:14] <doug65536> a queue on a DOM element? how does that even make sense? sure, it makes perfect sense for animations, but not when you're juggling a bunch of simultaneous operations
[19:06:23] <shoky> it makes sense, but yeah there's a limit to its usefulness
[19:06:50] <shoky> but yep, it's per element
[19:07:00] <shoky> at least, iirc ;p
[19:07:23] <doug65536> yes, you remember correctly. it is the first parameter in each of the overloads
[19:09:49] <doug65536> when I spread out several operations over time and simultaneously overlap another operation with all those, I can get that working easy. it's when things fadeout and fade in and click handlers hide and show that you run into race conditions and end up having to worry about what is in progress or block things until some bunch of things are done. I've tried to apply deferred etc but I find them cumbersome
[19:09:58] <doug65536> I really should force myself to use it more though
[19:11:52] <doug65536> shoky: is there a jquery way to do setTimeout? call something in the future?
[19:12:18] <shoky> nope, setTimeout is it
[19:18:46] <bobdobbs> I've got a jquery object: window.myApp.slides. If I type that string in console, and object with a bunch of properties gets dumped.
[19:19:00] <ChineseCockBuffe> The Chinese Cock Buffet is currently closed.
[19:19:06] <bobdobbs> However, if I do this, i get an error: window.myApp.slides.[0].css
[19:19:26] <bobdobbs> the error I get is; TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'css'
[19:19:54] <bobdobbs> what's up with that? What happened to my object?
[19:20:06] <doug65536> bobdobbs: use eq
[19:20:15] <doug65536> bobdobbs:  window.myApp.slides.eq(0).css(...
[19:20:40] <doug65536> bobdobbs: [0] returns the raw element
[19:21:08] <bobdobbs> "raw element"?
[19:21:26] <doug65536> bobdobbs: it unwraps it from the jquery wrapper and returns the underlying DOM element
[19:21:47] <bobdobbs> hmmmm
[19:22:10] <bobdobbs> I'm getting the same issue with ...eq(0):
[19:22:32] <bobdobbs> TypeError: Object #<NodeList> has no method 'eq'
[19:23:43] <bobdobbs> this is quiet frustrating. I thought I was really getting a handle on javascript, it's object model and the DOM
[19:26:08] <bobdobbs> It's also utterly confounding, because I know I have a jquery object.
[19:26:47] <bobdobbs> My understanding is that I should be able to use jquery's api calls on properties of a jquery object. But I'm stumped
[19:33:34] <shoky> bobdobbs: are you sure you've got a jquery object
[19:34:17] <doug65536> bobdobbs: just wrap it

[19:42:01] <thump_> ok heres the deal i want to put a pdf document online for people to download. is there a public free server for me to do this?
[19:42:12] <doug65536> thump_: dropbox
[19:42:42] <thump_> doug65536: but dropbox gets you to download and install something on your computer. weird
[19:42:52] <doug65536> thump_: you don't need to
[19:43:16] <thump_> doug65536: then whats the download for?
[19:43:20] <doug65536> thump_: it is assuming you are too dumb/lazy/something to use their web interface
[19:43:51] <doug65536> thump_: you have an account?
[19:44:08] <thump_> doug65536: no
[19:44:17] <doug65536> thump_: go to dropbox.com/home. click the upload button. upload it. then select it, click share, it will give you a public link
[19:44:18] <shoky> thump_: it lets you sync a folder on your drive to your online dropbox automagically
[19:44:43] <shoky> and only when the app is running, i leave it off 99% of the time
[19:45:03] <thump_> right thanks for replying guys
[19:45:25] <thump_> do i need to create an account before i do "... dropbox.com/home. click the upload button. upload it. then select it, click share, it will give you a public link"
[19:45:35] <shoky> why dontcha go check
[19:45:45] <doug65536> thump_: yes
[19:46:01] <doug65536> thump_: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdaa5gxpweqiy5d/unshaded_bmw.png
[19:47:03] <thump_> i have created an account and signed it
[19:47:10] <thump_> i see no upload button in HOME
[19:47:21] <doug65536> at the top
[19:47:26] <doug65536> a piece of paper and an up arrow
[19:48:31] <thump_> when i press home it goes to https://www.dropbox.com/business
[19:48:59] <doug65536> press home?
[19:49:31] <doug65536> https://www.dropbox.com/home
[19:49:44] <thump_> yeah i think i got it now
[19:50:52] <thump_> done
[19:51:01] <thump_> after uploading what do i do to share it?
[19:51:06] <doug65536> now click the chain thing beside the file
[19:51:11] <thump_> ok
[19:51:17] <doug65536> copy that address
[19:51:22] <doug65536> that's what you give people
[19:53:49] <thump_> right. it opens the file up and there is a "share link". ignore that? and just use the url?
[19:58:32] <thump_> when i goto url and click "direct download" i get screen displays HTML code jibberish
[19:59:31] <thump_> and i see it no downloading anywhere man
[20:01:49] <doug65536> thump_: you clicked the chain link icon right?
[20:04:18] <thump_> thump_: yes and it loaded up the pdf and i used that URL and when i visit it i get the pdf loading up and when i click "direct download" i get html code jibberish as page 1 of pdf is not rendered properly. but then it dissapears, not sure if it downloaded and where to look for it?
[20:04:35] <thump_> doug65536: that was for you
[20:05:11] <doug65536> thump_: the chain link icon is a "share" link. if you click that it takes you to a page. copy whatever is in the address bar in that page
[20:05:29] <doug65536> thump_: paste it here, I'll see if I get same gibberish
[20:05:40] <thump_> https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv8rkc0imbwyi79/MyApplicationForm.pdf?m
[20:05:51] <doug65536> works perfect
[20:06:08] <thump_> page1 of pdf loads?
[20:06:11] <doug65536> residential application form
[20:06:16] <thump_> yes
[20:06:25] <doug65536> do you have a pdf reader installed?
[20:06:26] <thump_> there are 4 pages to it
[20:06:34] <doug65536> not sure what is going on on your computer
[20:06:50] <doug65536> yes, applicant 1 2 3
[20:06:52] <thump_> does it download to your computer? if so where by default?
[20:07:14] <doug65536> ah, I see what's going on...
[20:07:38] <doug65536> thump_: yes it does screw up and show red background and a lot of html crap
[20:07:48] <doug65536> thump_: that's the first time I've seen dropbox screw up
[20:08:19] <thump_> i suppose thata stooping it from downloading
[20:08:55] <thump_> and i suppose you getting a blank page for page 1
[20:09:01] <doug65536> no
[20:09:04] <doug65536> page 1 is perfect
[20:09:13] <doug65536> https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv8rkc0imbwyi79/MyApplicationForm.pdf?dl=1
[20:09:19] <thump_> not for me
[20:09:46] <doug65536> thump_: click the disk icon at the bottom
[20:10:13] <doug65536> why does every website have to have Egyptian hieroglyphics instead of text
[20:10:23] <thump_> how did you get that dl url?
[20:10:31] <doug65536> I looked up the problem
[20:10:39] <doug65536> in google
[20:10:54] <doug65536> I just replaced the ? and everything after it with ?dl=1
[20:11:11] <doug65536> https://www.dropbox.com/help/201/en
[20:11:49] <doug65536> thump_: they also say to change the domain... let me try
[20:12:05] <doug65536> https://www.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xv8rkc0imbwyi79/MyApplicationForm.pdf?dl=1
[20:12:19] <doug65536> nope, that doesn't work
[20:12:50] <thump_> that's fine.
[20:12:52] <doug65536> ok forget the domain change, just do the ?dl=1 trick
[20:12:59] <thump_> i just use that one
[20:13:02] <thump_> thanks again
[20:13:03] <thump_> bye
[20:13:05] <doug65536> np
[20:13:59] <thump_> doug65536: one last question
[20:14:12] <thump_> doug65536: how long do those links stay alive for?
[20:14:41] <doug65536> thump_: forever as far as I know
[20:14:52] <doug65536> thump_: as long as you don't delete the file from your dropbox
[20:14:59] <thump_> doug65536: ok bye again :D
[20:15:27] <doug65536> bye :)
[20:20:22] <thump_> doug65536: back again
[20:20:51] <thump_> doug65536: just to confirm. it was the faulty pdf that made dl link fail correct?
[20:21:37] <doug65536> thump_: I'm not sure what failed, but the problem was probably dropbox. if you put ?dl=1 on the url it makes it behave properly. your pdf looks fine on my computer, all pages
[20:21:38] <Zackko> How can I get the height of an element's innerhtml when the innerhtml is floated and the parent is collapsed?
[20:22:31] <thump_> doug65536: ok then
[20:22:54] <doug65536> thump_: it appeared that their webserver said the content type was pdf but sent some html, so the browser shows a bunch of crap
[20:23:05] <doug65536> thump_: with the other link it does the right thing
[20:23:25] <thump_> ok
[20:29:02] <doug65536> Zackko: I found a solution at http://jsbin.com/ihakid/2/edit but it is a bit goofy - it requires certain styles to be present
[20:29:35] <doug65536> classes I mean
[20:30:10] <Zackko> I might be able to make that work :) ty
[20:50:46] <jleclanche> http://dpaste.com/1349742/ how can I get that change() callback to trigger after the actual change event? the .length is returning the amount of boxes checked before i clicked
[20:54:21] <doug65536> jleclanche: many semicolons are missing... no, EVERY semicolon is missing
[20:54:45] <jleclanche> doug65536: and none of those semicolons are making my callback trigger early, unfortunately
[20:57:17] <doug65536> jleclanche: how does selected get added and removed
[20:58:26] <doug65536> jleclanche: blame whatever code is supposed to be adding/removing those. they must provide an event that you can use. you are getting the DOM event before whatever that code is does its add or remove of the class
[20:58:26] <jleclanche> doug65536: good point, it gets changed on click
[20:58:32] <jleclanche> yeah
[20:58:33] <jleclanche> thanks
[20:59:27] <doug65536> jleclanche: a quick hack might be to defer your button update with a very short setTimeout
[21:00:00] <jleclanche> ill find something less ugly first :p
[21:14:00] <guy> $('iframe').on('load', function () { /* How to get uuid property from the loaded iframe document? */ }); In plain JavaScript, this would be window.foo.uuid, where foo is ID of the form.
[21:14:11] <guy> That's a question, just in case.
[21:15:52] <doug65536> guy: this.contentWindow.foo.uuid  probably
[21:16:28] <guy> Thanks.
[21:18:11] <guy> am I going crazy, or browser shouldn't (or at least used to be not) able to access input[type="file"] value?
[21:18:38] <guy> oh, wait. Ignore it. I didn't read the actual output "C:\fakepath\Payment Flow.graffle "
[21:19:15] <guy> kinda stupid way of returning the value though.
[21:20:14] <doug65536> guy: what did you expect?
[21:24:04] <haleys> Does anyone have a good way to disable cache in jquery mobile? data-dom-cache="false" on the data-role="page" element seems to work 50/50. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[21:27:23] <Mrgoose2> in jquery mobile can you do a full screen dialog without it being in a modal
[21:33:14] <haleys> Omg, got it. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-can-i-prevent-dom-caching-of-pages - third response down worked great.
[21:33:31] <haleys> Gotta love learning new things and the quarks/nuances. :)
[21:34:46] <PhlowHome> Quarks was a bar in deep space 9
[21:35:08] <PhlowHome> quirks? :)
[21:38:15] <guy> doug65536: this.value.split(/(\\|\/)/g).pop() would be nice
[21:43:14] <doug65536> guy pop is a nice touch :)
[21:43:53] <jleclanche> does jquery have a way of retrieving multiple data elements from a jquery selection? like $("tr").data("foo") retrieves [foo1, foo2, foo3...]
[21:44:45] <jleclanche> from what I can see, .data() only retrieves the data of the first element in the list
[21:55:46] <doug65536> jleclanche: .map should work
[21:55:53] <jleclanche> yeah i just used that
[21:56:02] <jleclanche> i was hoping there was a .dataList or something :)
[22:07:19] <Mrgoose2> is there a way to make a sidepanel scroll in jquery mobile?
[22:24:27] <doug65536> jleclanche: the .data thing makes sense. it would be cumbersome to match up an arbitrary data value with the original element
[23:12:50] <le_gars> Good morning I need help with an ajax form. If someone could take a look at it? Thanks
[23:13:42] <Cork> ?ask
[23:13:42] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:15:28] <le_gars> Ok, I',m jusat not sure how do structure the error handling pr if I should use $.ajax or $.post when Im doing a post?
[23:17:45] <Cork> le_gars: $.post is just a short hand for $.ajax
[23:17:56] <Cork> le_gars: so you can use witch ever you like
[23:18:54] <le_gars> yes that is true.
[23:19:50] <le_gars> but what do you think about this, is this a good way of serializing the values of a form? http://git.io/KzmVgQ
