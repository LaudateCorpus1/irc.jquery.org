[00:51:52] <sinorai> how do i remove  the classes "always-show" and "collapse" from this element? <div class="nav-collapse always-show collapse" style="height: 0px; overflow: hidden;">
[00:53:49] <sinorai> anyone ?
[00:53:52] <xec> .removeClass(""always-show collapse"")
[00:54:04] <xec> without the double double quotes
[00:54:08] <xec> .removeClass("always-show collapse")
[00:54:40] <sinorai> how does it know which element in the code it should remove those classes from ?
[00:54:48] <xec> it doesn't
[00:55:07] <xec> you need to provide some context if you want help making an accurate selector
[00:55:31] <xec> i mean, if it's the only div on the page you can do $("div")
[00:56:34] <sinorai> there's a lot of code on the oage..
[00:56:37] <sinorai> page*
[00:57:09] <xec> sinorai: how would you style that div with css?
[00:57:35] <sinorai> jsut want to remove those to classes and add 2 other classes..
[00:57:45] <xec> you have to select it first
[00:58:04] <xec> i have no idea what would be a unique selector for that div
[00:58:23] <Uhkis> $('.nav-collapse').removeClass('always-show collapse').addClass('other classes');
[00:58:36] <xec> maybe "div.nav-collapse.always-show.collapse" ?? maybe there are others that will match this selector
[00:59:51] <sinorai> http://pastebin.com/2FTa8siG <-- would this work ?
[01:00:18] <xec> no
[01:00:36] <negusnegesti> Hello guys!
[01:00:36] <negusnegesti> Unfortunately, I still have problems with my loadGif using ajaxStart and ajaxStop.
[01:00:36] <negusnegesti> Only firefox displays it. Chrome and Opera read: "Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/."
[01:00:36] <negusnegesti> Can you please provide me with some ideas in order to solve it?
[01:00:36] <negusnegesti> Thx in advance.
[01:00:50] <xec> sinorai: element is a native DOM element, not a jquery object
[01:01:14] <xec> sinorai: if you want to use jquery, you use $() instead of document.querySelector()
[01:01:31] <sinorai> http://pastebin.com/2FTa8siG <-- better ?
[01:01:31] <xec> sinorai: so element = $('.nav-collapse'); // works
[01:01:47] <xec> sinorai: not in the slightest
[01:01:48] <sinorai> ahhhhhhh ok.. ^
[01:01:51] <xec> ;)
[01:03:01] <xec> sinorai: this is basic jquery. i suggest reading up a bit http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[01:03:16] <sinorai> ok thanks....
[02:35:48] <zagaza> hi guys, why am I getting undefined is not a function here? http://jsfiddle.net/q8es76qw/    I have loaded history.js as external resource, and I still get undefined here:   var State = History.getState();
[02:45:51] <Woet> zagaza: not sure how it's related to jQuery, but what part of the documentation told you to use https://rawgit.com/browserstate/history.js/master/scripts/uncompressed/history.js ?
[02:46:04] <DelphiWorld> hi jqueryists
[02:46:25] <DelphiWorld> could someone tel me how to create a button using jquery ui and assign a js function to it?
[02:46:43] <Woet> DelphiWorld: what is the code you have so far?
[02:47:03] <DelphiWorld> Woet: the code to run on the button click?
[02:47:12] <DelphiWorld> Woet: or the full code
[02:47:30] <Woet> DelphiWorld: well, I assume you have read the documentation, implemented the code as mentioned and are running into an issue?
[02:48:04] <DelphiWorld> Woet: not realy much, i dont use jquery so much but i'm creating a call button
[02:48:14] <DelphiWorld> the sip part is done so now i want to implement just the button
[02:48:23] <Woet> DelphiWorld: so read the documentation
[03:01:25] <nrl> Morning! What is the best way to check if an element has a certain css property?
[03:04:39] <DelphiWorld> Woet: http://paste.debian.net/150475/
[03:04:47] <DelphiWorld> Woet: i'm afraid might see some errors there
[03:05:05] <DelphiWorld> Woet, sadly the browser console is unreadible for me;(
[03:05:21] <DelphiWorld> the click is not working
[03:08:24] <Woet> DelphiWorld: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/

[03:36:06] <ul71m0> Hi, i have design that has something like tabs on ti, but they are scroll drivenn. So when i get on that section of the page, and while scrolling my mouse i need to make it so it changes tabs and after last one continue with scroll
[03:38:53] <DelphiWorld> Woet, now: <div id="callstatus"></div>
[03:39:05] <DelphiWorld> how to make it hidden by default?
[03:49:40] <Woet> DelphiWorld: use basic CSS?
[03:54:19] <Cork> DelphiWorld: if you plan to show it again with .show() run .hide() on ready
[03:54:47] <DelphiWorld> Cork: GOOD, DUDE
[03:54:56] <DelphiWorld> Cork: so you dont recomand inline css right?
[03:55:23] <Cork> .show depends on .hide for it to know what display should be when it shows the element
[03:55:41] <Cork> that is why setting display: none; manually is a less then good choice
[03:55:41] <DelphiWorld> Cork: LOL... fun! :P
[03:55:45] <DelphiWorld> Cork: hold on let me atempt
[03:55:52] <Cork> DelphiWorld: alternatively use a class
[03:55:58] <Cork> then you don't get the problem at all
[03:56:09] <Cork> inline css should be avoided as far as possible
[03:56:17] <DelphiWorld> Cork: hold on mydude
[03:56:23] <Cork> lol
[03:56:28] <Cork> i'm stressing you? :D
[03:56:35] <DelphiWorld> Cork: i'm getting a bit happyer
[03:56:58] <DelphiWorld> Cork: see here, <div class="call" style="display:none">
[03:57:16] <Uhkis> lol
[03:57:16] <DelphiWorld> Cork: so i should remove that style
[03:57:21] <Cork> yes
[03:57:22] <Uhkis> yes
[03:57:36] <DelphiWorld> <div class="call">
[03:57:40] <DelphiWorld> removed
[03:57:42] <DelphiWorld> let me hide it
[03:57:54] <Cork> either do <div class="call something-that-explains-the-state-where-it-is-not-visible"></div>
[03:58:00] <Cork> or just call .hide()
[03:58:09] <DelphiWorld> Cork: will do .hide
[03:58:12] <Uhkis> Cork: or like we people call it, hidden :D
[03:58:32] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: :P
[03:58:36] <Cork> well i explicitly didn't call it hide/hidden cause it should be a more specific state
[03:58:44] * DelphiWorld bounse Uhkis  out of the earth back to the jQuery planet
[03:58:55] <Cork> like class="call collapsed" or something
[04:00:46] <DelphiWorld> booooooooooooooooo
[04:00:56] * DelphiWorld pay Cork a dinner
[04:01:39] <Uhkis> try less caffeine, you're all over the place :D
[04:02:07] <DelphiWorld> hehehe, Uhkis
[04:02:14] <DelphiWorld> Uhkis: all over the places? where? :P

[06:56:06] <sagittarian> does anyone know where commitplease gets its list of valid components?  i don't see them in package.json.  I'm working with jquery-mobile
[06:56:51] <Omar-> sagittarian pls clarify
[06:57:34] <sagittarian> Omar-: there is a node package called commitplease which is used in a commit-msg git hook that insists that the summary of your commit message should contain the "component" that the commit affects
[06:57:53] <bbclover> Hey guys, if I want to pass some objects in the data option for an $.ajax() class, can I name the property the same as the object? i.e. if I have some var myArray, data: { myArray: myArray }, or do I have to use this.myArray: myArray for scope reasons? (Usually I just name it something different)
[06:58:03] <bbclover> for an $.ajax() call*
[06:58:06] <sagittarian> from the commitplease docs, it seems you can specify the list of valid components in package.json, but i don't see any such list in jquery-mobile's package.json
[06:59:40] <abishek> anybody know of a color checker control using jquery?
[07:01:06] <sacho_> you can, bbclover
[07:01:41] <bbclover> sacho_: just using the same name or do I have to use this.?
[07:01:59] <sacho_> you dnt need this
[07:05:24] <lugzer> hello
[07:07:54] <lugzer> i have a simple example with element being positioned and having background-size changed according to window scrolled position, the more you scroll down, the smaller the element gets, and so on. few simple lines. but i noticed that the CPU goes up high. is this normal for observing a scroll event?
[07:09:49] <BillCriswell> lugzer: scroll events can get nuts. You might want to throttle them a bit, or possible set the background to a fixed size and scale the element with css scale() instead?
[07:09:55] <BillCriswell> lugzer: All total guesses though.
[07:10:23] <decx> show your scroll function code
[07:12:01] <killa_kyle> having a problem with a counter script. it works fine on the first pass, but throws an error if you trigger it again " Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'shift' of null"
[07:12:06] <Dorf> in theory if i have $('.something).hide(); before $('.somethingElse').show(); the hide should run and then the show, right?
[07:12:49] <decx> yes, but you won't be seeing it
[07:13:14] <Dorf> what can i do to make sure that the hide is visible before the show?
[07:13:25] <killa_kyle> delay
[07:13:31] <decx> fadeOut instead
[07:14:18] <Dorf> even if they happened at the same time it would be better than the hide before the show
[07:14:53] <bbclover> if I'm trying to pass an array and get some data back in my ajax call, what should my dataType: be? I have it as "json"
[07:15:08] <bbclover> well that's for how I receive the data I guess?
[07:18:12] <sacho_> no, dataType is what you expect from the server.
[07:26:23] <bbclover> if I have an array do I need to JSON.stringify it before sending it in an ajax call?
[07:26:57] <cjohnson> depends what you mean
[07:26:59] <sacho_> no
[07:27:07] <cjohnson> jquery's ajax wrapper will do that for you
[07:27:18] <cjohnson> but yes you have to turn it into a string in some fashion
[07:27:31] <bbclover> on the server side?
[07:27:31] <cjohnson> can't send an array over http unless you serialize it
[07:27:44] <cjohnson> how would you do it on the server side
[07:27:58] <cjohnson> I'm assuming you mean $.ajax though so don't sweat it -- it does that for you automagically
[07:27:59] <bbclover> well I guess the ajax wrapper will seraliaze it for me?
[07:28:08] <bbclover> okay, great
[07:29:28] <ashemark> Hi!
[07:32:05] <ashemark> I'm using a jquery based plugin with with my bootstrap website containing iframes
[07:32:30] <ashemark> the plugin works only when nested inside $(document).ready
[07:33:03] <ashemark> How do I make it work in the iframes?
[09:11:06] <chargen> I get this error on an ajax call: 500 (Internal Server Error). Any hint on how to get more info than that?
[09:11:30] <robertmaxrees> that's up to your server.
[09:11:38] <robertmaxrees> 500 means something internally went "nope"
[09:13:13] <chargen> I strange because I make a similar call in another script and it works
[09:13:28] <chargen> Can it be some error in my js code?
[09:13:55] <robertmaxrees> the "error" would be you sending something to your backend that it's not expecting.
[09:14:29] <chargen> I've checked apache log but couldn't find anything
[09:14:38] <robertmaxrees> what backend language are you using?
[09:14:45] <chargen> php
[09:15:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't know anything about PHP but there should be a way for you to surface more detailed errors.
[09:16:07] <chargen> I just store some data on the DB. I use two scripts and one works and the other one no.
[09:16:19] <robertmaxrees> then share the scripts?
[09:16:37] <robertmaxrees> JS can't, by itself, generate server errors.  you are sending something to your backend that it's not expecting.
[09:17:09] <robertmaxrees> the JS itself can be perfectly valid and functional and still generate backend errors.
[09:17:35] <robertmaxrees> check to see what differences there are between the two ajax calls.
[09:20:19] <chargen> I process some data in the first function the I store it on the DB with the later: http://hastebin.com/cajukaputi.cs
[09:21:02] <chargen> I have another script for daily data instead of weekly that works, but it doesn't have ajax call in the anon functions.
[09:22:24] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[09:22:27] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[09:22:34] <robertmaxrees> show me the ajax call that works, and the ajax call that doesn't work.
[09:22:39] <robertmaxrees> just those, not all the extra stuff.
[09:23:47] <chargen> http://hastebin.com/qisijiyeju.sm
[09:24:00] <chargen> I've put them in the same paste
[09:24:10] <chargen> look like equal to me
[09:25:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.  something is busted in your backend.
[09:25:55] <chargen> yeah, the js is ok
[09:26:30] <robertmaxrees> check your types.
[09:27:14] <amore123> how to download a file using jquery?
[09:27:14] <chargen> ok, I'll try to get some info from the php or the apache
[09:27:22] <chargen> thanks anyway
[09:47:22] <jakesy> you mean request a URI or prompt the user for a file download?
[09:50:10] <siegfried> Hi! Please remember me. When I use $ function it returns plain DOM elements. There is a way to return another jquery function with jQuery methods, like an wrapper to these dom objects...
[09:50:22] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:50:23] <jeffmjack> what would you call something that behaved like an image gallery for mobile but with text files?
[09:50:42] <robertmaxrees> siegfried you can use jQuery
[09:51:21] <siegfried> robertmaxes, f.e. el = $('#id'), then i need to use $(el)
[09:51:38] <siegfried> but it was a way to write $el = something to use just $el
[09:54:57] <robertmaxrees> siegfried still not making sense.
[09:55:03] <robertmaxrees> why isn't $ just jquery?
[09:55:13] <robertmaxrees> if it's not jquery, you have to pass the element to jQuery
[09:56:59] <robertmaxrees> you could do el = $('#someElement'); $el = $(el); but that's code smell.
[09:56:59] <siegfried> robertmaxrees, ah, nevermind
[09:57:10] <robertmaxrees> ?
[09:57:14] <siegfried> i can use just el with all jquery methods
[09:57:27] <robertmaxrees> if $ is jquery, then yeah you can.
[10:21:44] <bbclover> if I use jquery's ajax to serialize and send over my array, I get docIds%5B%5D=1&docIds%5B%5D=2&docIds%5B%5D=3 as my query string. When this is sent over to my server, how do I parse it (in java, specifically, if that matters)
[10:22:02] <bbclover> cause I tried getting the parameter docIds[] and I just get the first entry, which happens to be 1
[10:22:21] <robertmaxrees> that's serializing it as a query string.
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> why not just send it as JSON?
[10:22:35] <bbclover> I think it is sent as json
[10:22:44] <robertmaxrees> docIds%5B%5D=1&docIds%5B%5D=2&docIds%5B%5D=3 is not json
[10:22:45] <bbclover> I just took an array and put it in my data option
[10:22:47] <robertmaxrees> that's a query string.
[10:22:53] <bbclover> how do I make it send as json then?
[10:23:03] <robertmaxrees> are you posting it?
[10:23:10] <bbclover> (I just got this from my network tab in IE, maybe it generates  a query string?)
[10:23:20] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ bbclover
[10:23:21] <bbclover> yeah, to my server
[10:23:21] <b-ot> bbclover: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:24:13] <bbclover> http://pastebin.com/TdWC0thE
[10:24:30] <robertmaxrees> type: "GET",
[10:24:33] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[10:24:45] <robertmaxrees> dataType is the data you're expecting back from the server.
[10:24:49] <BinaryKitten> bbclover - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6967258/associative-array-request-parameter-parsing-with-java-servlet
[10:24:53] <robertmaxrees> delete that and use type: "POST" instead.
[10:25:07] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have JSON to work with on the java side.
[10:25:24] <bbclover> I need to use get because I'm passing this array to get get some data back
[10:25:51] <robertmaxrees> lol you said you were posting it earlier - check out BinaryKitten's suggestion then.
[10:25:58] <robertmaxrees> you need to parse the querystring.
[10:27:16] <bbclover> well I guess I'm posting then getting, but yeah, sorry for the confusion (I was confused myself!)
[10:27:27] <robertmaxrees> you're not postign anything.
[10:27:46] <robertmaxrees> you're using a GET to fetch a URL.
[10:27:48] <robertmaxrees> not POST.
[10:29:24] <BinaryKitten> bbclover - interesting nick for someone from NY
[10:29:41] <BinaryKitten> (just on a side note.. i just found it interesting)
[10:31:19] <bbclover> you know I'm from NY?
[10:31:24] <bbclover> haha
[10:32:24] <BinaryKitten> bbclover - Tech Valley Communications
[10:32:49] <BinaryKitten> ip lookup isn't that difficult these days
[10:33:33] <bbclover> wow
[10:33:54] <bbclover> so because I'm using a get robertmaxrees I'm not sending over data as json so I can't use jackson
[10:34:02] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:34:20] <robertmaxrees> because the data you want is in the URL, not the post body.
[10:34:23] <bbclover> so I have to do some query string manipulation on docIds%5B%5D=1&docIds%5B%5D=2&docIds%5B%5D=3?
[10:35:11] <robertmaxrees> you need to parse the query string.
[10:35:13] <robertmaxrees> not manipulate it.

[10:53:00] <SmashingX2> Im looking to do a filter for a table just like what ebay does, in one side all the results and in the left side a list of filters e.g. filter by brand, by size, etc. Is there something that I can use with jquery?
[10:53:54] <robertmaxrees> you want a faceted search.
[10:54:02] <robertmaxrees> what's your backend?
[10:55:22] <robertmaxrees> also, ebay doesn't use a table.
[10:59:03] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: i was thinking form the frontend approach
[10:59:09] <wa5ted> never thought about the backend
[11:01:41] <robertmaxrees> the frontend for that kind of system is relatively simple.
[11:02:10] <robertmaxrees> you could do 90% of the work in the backend, or you could bring the templating to the frontend.
[11:02:44] <robertmaxrees> if you want to use AJAX, that is.
[11:12:37] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: But I use a table
[11:14:09] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: is there such a thing in jquery mobile?
[11:20:57] <sheeny> Could anyone help me out with the data in an ajax request I can't seem to get it in the correct format.. see here https://gist.github.com/craigsheen/b309f7aba7c40ed5acf2
[11:25:36] <codeshah> hey guys, i am changing the rel canonical / next / prev using jQuery but it seems that is not showing up on vie wpage source.
[11:27:44] <BillCriswell> codeshah: What you do in jQuery wouldn't effect what you see when you "View Source"
[11:27:56] <BillCriswell> It would show up in the DOM inspector in dev tools, thouhg.
[11:28:10] <codeshah> BillCriswell, yes, I see that. Hmm, but google still sees the old stuff in their webmaster tools
[11:28:14] <codeshah> is that expected?
[11:29:02] <BillCriswell> codeshah: Their crawler is supposed to pick up Javascript from what I gather, but it's still pretty experimental. What you're doing I definitely wouldn't do client side.
[11:29:10] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 not really.  you need to use a backend search system.
[11:29:38] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: like for example?
[11:29:46] <codeshah> BillCriswell, ok thanks. I am using a "Load More" button dynamically so maybe I should pass the data to the asp.net backend and change the page content hmm
[11:30:11] <robertmaxrees> sheeny don't do this with javascript.
[11:30:16] <robertmaxrees> toss over JSON and parse tat.
[11:30:19] <robertmaxrees> *that
[11:30:39] <sheeny> ah okay (Y)
[11:30:42] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 depends entirely on what your needs are.  can you describe the system you're trying to build?
[11:34:04] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 the reason I say that is because you could use anything from something like a simple set of DB queries to a textsearch like dtsearch (if that's still a thing) to a faceting system like solr.
[11:35:01] <danbower> if i know that jquery is loaded in the <head> and i have some code towards the closing <body> tag that relies on jquery having been loaded, is there *any* justification for wrapping the footer code in a $(document).ready() equivalent?
[11:35:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to super ultra make sure that the document is ready?
[11:35:38] <robertmaxrees> document ready and loading jquery are different concepts.
[11:36:55] <danbower> perhaps i should re-phrase my question and just ask in #javascript
[11:37:08] <robertmaxrees> or here :)
[11:38:49] <danbower> ok. say i have a body of JS code which i'll call A. A sits in the <head>. there's also some javascript towards the closing body, B, which relies on a function defined in A. by virtue of being lower down in the DOM, is there ever an instance where B will error out as A's function hasn't been loaded in yet?
[11:39:00] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:39:02] <danbower> excuse my loose/incorrect phrasing, pretty ignorant about this stuff :)
[11:40:33] <snover> robertmaxrees’s answer is wrong
[11:40:36] <Valduare> hi guys -   can you removeclass if you only know part of the name?   ie glyphicon-*
[11:40:40] <robertmaxrees> it is, snover?
[11:40:50] <snover> async scripts
[11:41:00] <robertmaxrees> oooh.
[11:41:04] <robertmaxrees> that's a great point.
[11:41:07] <robertmaxrees> you are 100% right.
[11:41:32] <robertmaxrees> danbower i was in fact incorrect.
[11:41:37] <danbower> tbh that did occur to me and i assumed as such, i was more talking about the more traditional flow
[11:41:56] <Valduare> o/ robertmaxrees how are you doing today
[11:42:12] <snover> scripts that exist in the source html and are not async will always execute in document order
[11:42:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm alright.  sleepy.
[11:42:31] <robertmaxrees> Valduare you have to parse out the class property of the node to find the one you want
[11:43:01] <danbower> so browser gets response and when it encounters a <script> element, its content is parsed and executed before anything else continues, right (assuming no async usage)
[11:43:54] <Valduare> so regex stuff?
[11:44:38] <robertmaxrees> Valduare sure, or you could split the classes on ' ' to create an array and use indexOf() on each one to find the one you want.
[11:46:11] <danbower> thanks guys. this came up at work and i was quite sure my co-worker was incorrect. i'll settle for wrapping the footer code in an anonymous function
[11:46:26] <robertmaxrees> anonymous or a doc ready?
[11:46:41] <robertmaxrees> or a doc ready that uses an anonymous
[11:46:58] <killa_kyle> how do I loop this function that animates images? http://codepen.io/killa-kyle/pen/JoLdQK?editors=101
[11:47:04] <danbower> (function(){console.log('foo');})()
[11:47:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah an IIFe - just wondering why that.
[11:48:06] <robertmaxrees> killa_kyle woah.
[11:48:24] <killa_kyle> ?
[11:48:50] <robertmaxrees> you could just use a for loop and increment by 1 until you reach the .length of all the things you want and then start over.
[11:48:53] <robertmaxrees> instead of that big object.
[11:49:03] <robertmaxrees> or use an $.each(), actually.
[11:49:13] <boshhead> jQuery.Event( "keydown", { keyCode: 64 } );  That's how to do that keydown event, if I want to create a "change" event for a <select> dropdown box, how do I pass the value of what has been selected? (Instead of keyCode it should be?)
[11:49:41] <danbower> robertmaxrees, my understanding is that it simply prevents variables defined within the anonymous function to the global scope
[11:49:50] <danbower> avoiding clobbering issues
[11:50:09] <robertmaxrees> danbower basically, yeah.  just wondering why you were asking about document ready and then "settled on" an IIFE - i get what you're saying now.
[11:50:31] <danbower> ah right. well thanks again :)
[11:51:13] <killa_kyle> robertmaxrees I want to be able to tweak the timings of each of the fadein/fadeouts, I can do that the way it's set up now, but I'm confused on how to make it reset and begin again
[11:51:58] <Es0teric> has anyone here used selectizejs?
[11:52:03] <robertmaxrees> meh, either way, you want a recursive function to basically build your own enumerator
[11:52:25] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: I want to do something that is pretty basic, a mockup with no db involved where I have a table of sample data to the right with facet filters on the left hand side.
[11:52:44] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: and using jquery mobile
[11:52:49] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 you've been at this for a few days now - you keep getting stuck.
[11:52:53] <robertmaxrees> why is jqueyr mobile a requirement?
[11:53:04] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: what? no!
[11:53:16] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: because that’s what Im using
[11:53:26] <robertmaxrees> because you need to support mobile devices?
[11:54:00] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: I’ve been working on the design of this mockup and I finished with the problem that I had before. I don’t know what you mean by I keep getting stuck
[11:54:10] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: yes, support for mobile devices
[11:54:18] <robertmaxrees> you've been asking about how to build that exact UI for the last few days.
[11:54:27] <robertmaxrees> i originally suggested isotope
[11:54:41] <SmashingX2> but I finished with what I had before
[11:54:55] <SmashingX2> this is acompletely new task that I started working today
[11:55:04] <robertmaxrees> okay ;)
[11:55:53] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: the whole task takes a while I don’t know why you said that it has been a few days now
[11:56:47] <robertmaxrees> i must be confusing you with somebody else then - sorry about that
[11:56:57] <Es0teric> has anyone used this before: http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/ ?
[11:57:55] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: what was the task that that “somebody” else had/
[11:57:56] <SmashingX2> ?
[11:58:02] <robertmaxrees> exactly what you're describing.
[11:58:33] <robertmaxrees> somebody else was in here recently asking about how to build a page with filters on the left hand side that would update a table on the right.
[11:59:29] <SmashingX2> mhh I asked that this morning
[11:59:48] <robertmaxrees> i seem to recall it being a few days ago, but i could be mistaken.
[12:00:02] <SmashingX2> yeah probably it was me
[12:00:07] <SmashingX2> because it was the whole picture
[12:00:22] <robertmaxrees> okay.  either way, check out isotope if you want a frontend solution.
[12:01:15] <danbower> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering.html
[12:01:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise if you don't need all the animations and stuff you could build that pretty simply yourself.
[12:02:38] <SmashingX2> how?
[12:02:51] <SmashingX2> you mean reading the code from that plugin?
[12:02:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:03:12] <danbower> you'll probably wanna look into backbone or whatever the current JS fad is
[12:03:31] <robertmaxrees> backbone, react, riot, angular, etc.
[12:03:31] <SmashingX2> http://demo.srchulo.com/jquery/jquery_facets/
[12:03:40] <robertmaxrees> alternatively you could just hide things that match certain criteria.
[12:03:42] <SmashingX2> that is like the one I want
[12:03:49] <SmashingX2> except with a table to the right
[12:03:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you using a table?
[12:04:08] <SmashingX2> because I need a table to display my data
[12:04:20] <robertmaxrees> you should probably use something else to make styling less painful.
[12:04:31] <SmashingX2> styling?
[12:04:36] <robertmaxrees> hiding/showing things.
[12:04:42] <robertmaxrees> tables are a pain to work with.
[12:04:52] <SmashingX2> like what would be the closest to a table?
[12:05:24] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to build something yourself probably using a <ul>
[12:05:36] <SmashingX2> but with the columns on the top that are lock to the top part of the screen when you scroll down
[12:05:57] <robertmaxrees> you could also look at datatables, which is pretty popular.
[12:06:51] <robertmaxrees> which offers like 85% of what you're looking for out of the box afaik
[12:08:00] <danbower> robertmaxrees, have you been lurking in javascript related channels for some years now? your name is quite familiar
[12:08:22] <robertmaxrees> a few months under this username, yeah.
[12:08:36] <danbower> i'm thinking more 2012
[12:08:41] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[12:08:47] <SmashingX2> damn, but then I would have to thrown all my code away
[12:09:21] <SmashingX2> and then do all the styles that I need using this datatables and then you’ll say: you’ve been stuck with this for quite a while”
[12:09:32] <robertmaxrees> i already apologized duder.
[12:09:33] <danbower> SmashingX2, that's besides the point. the best solution is your priority. besides, very few people land on the best solution first time round
[12:09:40] <danbower> and i bet you've learned a thing or two
[12:09:57] <robertmaxrees> datatables might not be the right solution in your case.
[12:09:59] <robertmaxrees> maybe it will be.
[12:10:12] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have a tradeoff with your needs vs desires vs what's out there.
[12:11:46] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: do you know how can I make this datatabes to get the header row of the table lock to the top of the screen when you are scrolling down/
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't have any direct experience, but i'd imagine somebody has built in something that does that.,
[12:12:33] <robertmaxrees> !g datatables sticky header
[12:12:39] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: FixedHeader - DataTables → http://www.datatables.net/extensions/fixedheader/
[12:12:53] <danbower> boom
[12:12:59] <robertmaxrees> first result in google.
[12:13:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd weigh this as a contender for what you need.
[12:13:42] <danbower> SmashingX2, you'd be wise to ask questions only when you're truly stuck otherwise people may start not paying attention
[12:14:07] <robertmaxrees> eh, i'd say they're probably having a hard time knowing how to break the problem down into its component parts.
[12:14:15] <SmashingX2> ok I just have to see if there are good versions of the fitlers
[12:14:18] <SmashingX2> filters
[12:14:38] <robertmaxrees> one of those things where you see the problem as the entirety of the end result, instead of a series of things to accomplish.
[12:15:14] <danbower> that's an interesting thought
[12:15:30] <robertmaxrees> that's often the issue with new developers.
[12:15:42] <robertmaxrees> they're not able to break the problem down mentally.
[12:16:45] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: or why were you saying in the first instance that I should use datatables for the facet filter search?
[12:16:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:18:21] <robertmaxrees> i suggested it because you're using tables - it should be able to support most/all of what you need.
[12:19:04] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: but you have never seen the facet filter search working with datatables have you?
[12:19:39] <robertmaxrees> doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[12:20:57] <SmashingX2> well I’ve to see how easy/hard would that be before going that way
[12:21:06] <robertmaxrees> search around on google.
[12:21:18] <robertmaxrees> http://datatables.net/development/filtering should be helpful.
[12:21:24] <robertmaxrees> faceting/filtering/etc.
[12:38:07] <Prometheian> If I'm trying to take an action when the page unloads, is it better to use document.bind("beforeunload", function(){}) or document.addEventListener/attachEvent?
[13:07:00] <LindsayMac> I'm trying to refactor a modal window I had coded to work on a timer (instead of on click) to close out since it's just a notification instead of an actual action-required box. I'm just stuck on how to trigger the "close" method after a certain amount of time has passed since opening. Here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/L42a6cq2/2/
[13:07:39] <robertmaxrees> you can call .click() on the close button.
[13:07:51] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  are you talking to me?
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:08:14] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i want to NOT use a click to close and isntead have it close on its own
[13:08:18] <robertmaxrees> in a setTimeout you can do $('#close').click();
[13:08:28] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want to refactor the close code
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L42a6cq2/3/
[13:08:59] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  yea.. i dont want a click anymore. Just trying to reuse some code. I thought it would make sense to use this but just refactor that bit
[13:09:02] <robertmaxrees> could do something like this.\
[13:09:35] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  umm.. what did you change there?
[13:09:48] <robertmaxrees> var closeModal = function() { /* your code here */ }
[13:09:49] <LindsayMac> I see the addition of a var closeModal
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> then jQuery("#close").click(closeModal);
[13:09:58] <LindsayMac> but then how do I call the vloseModal var
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> then you can call closeModal(); whenever you want to close it.
[13:10:11] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  does that not still require a CLICK?
[13:10:29] <robertmaxrees> huh? the binding is the same.
[13:10:30] <robertmaxrees> jQuery("#close").click(closeModal);
[13:10:31] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  again.. im stuck on how to trigger something in a given time frame more than anything
[13:10:43] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout()
[13:10:45] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i dont want to bind to a click event... i dont want to require someone to click anything
[13:10:53] <LindsayMac> ever
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> okay, then setTimeout() and call that function.
[13:11:46] <robertmaxrees> in the function that opens it, do window.setTimeout(closeModal, 1000); or however long it should stay open.
[13:12:19] <LindsayMac> ok
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> the first part was just to abstract it out and show you how you'd pass that reference around.
[13:16:04] <LindsayMac> ok i will revisit to rry to put this to practice now
[13:16:52] <LindsayMac> why window.setTimeout ?? why WINDOW
[13:17:33] <robertmaxrees> you could just do setTimeout() instead i guess.
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> makes it clear where the method is coming from.
[13:17:42] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout
[13:20:19] <LindsayMac> got it! thanks!
[13:21:35] <dismist> hey robert i think u just taught her how to make a modal pop up in your face on a web site you might potentially be browsing some day
[13:21:55] <LindsayMac> dismist:  its a 'your form has been successfully submitted" message
[13:22:02] <LindsayMac> there ARE legit purposes for modal pop ups
[13:22:04] <dismist> i bet it is
[13:22:14] <dismist> shouldnt u be in the kitchen
[13:22:20] <LindsayMac> ugh ok
[13:22:30] <LindsayMac> i forgot you were a worthless troll
[13:22:33] <LindsayMac> nevermind
[13:22:53] <dismist> but its been years since we spoke
[13:25:28] <workisfun> Hi, I am trying to use append in a for loop to append <p>data</p>, like so http://pastebin.com/Aqy7ij1s but after many iterations, there seems to only be 1 <p> </p> with all the data from the for loop iteration inside, could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong with append?
[13:26:29] <workisfun> actually i just realized my data may be wrong, one second :l
[13:36:59] <cjohnson> workisfun: those aren't guaranteed to run in order btw
[13:37:06] <cjohnson> far from it in fact
[13:37:37] <workisfun> what are you referring to when you say won't run in order
[13:38:20] <workisfun> the loop order of the map?
[13:38:34] <cjohnson> the requests will fire in order, but they aren't guaranteed to return in the order you fired them
[13:38:41] <cjohnson> it's up to the network stack and js scheduler
[13:38:58] <cjohnson> so your appended list won't necessarily be in the order you expect
[13:39:11] <workisfun> oh the post requests, hmm i see
[13:40:27] <workisfun> I may have to think about since i did want to be able to sort by statistics, since that was a map[figures] to occurances
[13:40:33] <workisfun> think about that*
[13:41:16] <cjohnson> if you want to preserve their order, you could use Promise.all (or more likely, using jQuery.when) to call a function that appends all 10 after all 10 requests (promises) have been fulfilled
[13:41:33] <cjohnson> see the examples: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[13:42:14] <cjohnson> that way they still run in parallel
[13:42:18] <workisfun> i think creating the divs with ids before hand in place first and populating them properly after the requests come back might be faster?
[13:42:41] <cjohnson> I'm not sure what you mean by faster
[13:42:54] <cjohnson> using $.when retains their parallel processing, so speed isn't impacted
[13:42:56] <workisfun> with promise.all i imagine all requests have to finish first?
[13:43:08] <cjohnson> correct
[13:43:18] <workisfun> i was thinking, the divs could be populated as they come back so there's no waiting
[13:43:41] <workisfun> but here, the divs would need to be created first
[13:43:49] <cjohnson> well, that depends on the ajax requests. if they're all to the same service, they'll probably all finish at about the same time
[13:43:56] <cjohnson> which would mean there really wouldn't be any delay using $.when
[13:44:07] <cjohnson> but if you're communicating to different services, your way might be better to avoid waiting on slow requests
[13:44:23] <cjohnson> the IDs method would definitely be a lot messier imo
[13:44:47] <workisfun> hmm it is the same service, i will definitely check out the .when
[13:54:49] <abishek> is there a way to sort elements by a className?
[13:56:30] <NoiseEee> 'sort' ?
[13:58:06] <NoiseEee> abishek: ?
[13:59:25] <abishek> NoiseEee, I have this UI http://prntscr.com/66g6xw and the ticked one's have className assigned. I want to move all of them to the first of the list and then the rest. Is there a way to do this?
[14:01:53] <NoiseEee> what are ticked? are those checkboxes?
[14:02:34] <abishek> they are just icons
[14:02:59] <abishek> i tried $('.existingColor').sort(), but that doesn't bind the UI
[14:05:02] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: I migrate all my project to use datatables, but I can’t find anything that has the facet search for datatables :(
[14:08:15] <abishek> NoiseEee, this works $('.existingColor').sort().each(function(){
[14:08:15] <abishek>   $(this).prependTo($(this).parent());
[14:08:15] <abishek> });
[14:08:57] <NoiseEee> so go for it
[14:09:16] <abishek> ya, having a few ui issues doing that, once I figure out, I will
[14:09:19] <abishek> :), thnx
[14:40:45] <Enelar> Guys, i have question. Could $.ajax invoke callback in same execution frame, or it will always cause something similar to setTimeout?
[14:44:17] <Enelar> I could give it simplier. My ajax callback require some code to be pre-executed. Like: A() -> CB();
[14:44:42] <Enelar> If i white $.ajax(CB); A(); there will be error or not?
[14:45:25] <Enelar> If $.ajax causing something like setTimeout, even if resource cached, i could assume that execution of last code will be ajax -> A -> CB
[14:45:51] <Enelar> but if you have no answer, i just will write: $.ajax(setTimeout(CB)); A()
[15:03:38] <duch_kazatel> Enelar don't rely on $.ajax() completing before other code runs.
[15:04:09] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, thanks
[15:04:36] <robertmaxrees> always use the callback facilities available with any async code - deferreds makes this a very simple/easy thing to do.
[15:09:56] <sacho_> Enelar, what is the point of calling $.ajax(setTimeout)...?
[15:10:23] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: well apparently datatables don’t have an easy way to do the filter search facet
[15:10:34] <Enelar> sacho_, well, every setTimeout(cb, 0) call, causing defering cb invoke in next execution frame
[15:10:38] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 really?  i was looking at a page earlier that seemed to be pretty simple.
[15:11:12] <Enelar> sacho_, so i could invoke code right after current function finished, and all parents functions finished too
[15:11:12] <sacho_> Enelar, I know what setTimeout does. I'm asking you what you're trying to achieve with that.
[15:12:29] <Enelar> sacho_, i trying not block network requests with computations. I causing begin network utilise, then execute A(), witch uses much cpu, and could be sure, when CB will invoke, A() is finished(because of setTimeout)
[15:12:50] <sacho_> what?
[15:12:52] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: what page?
[15:13:10] <sacho_> Enelar, try reading what you just wrote and tell me if it makes any sense
[15:13:15] <robertmaxrees> Enelar are you acutally having performance issues?
[15:13:17] <Enelar> sorry for english
[15:13:28] <robertmaxrees> i see exactly what he's saying - he's trying to not block network requests with callbacks.
[15:13:35] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, yes, my site full ajax, and he begin to show only after 1000ms
[15:13:37] <robertmaxrees> except that shouldn't be a concern.
[15:13:42] <sacho_> you can't block network requests with callbacks
[15:13:52] <robertmaxrees> he's blocking the DOM i'm guessing.
[15:14:07] <Enelar> no, sec
[15:14:09] <sacho_> ...whatever that means
[15:14:17] <robertmaxrees> he's seeing things lock up i'm guessing.
[15:14:29] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 http://www.datatables.net/plug-ins/filtering/ i guess.
[15:14:40] <Enelar> https://github.com/Enelar/phoxy/blob/master/phoxy.js#L702
[15:14:58] <sacho_> Enelar, from what I understood, you're trying to make a request, then run your function A after it's done, then call the callback after A is done..?
[15:15:19] <Enelar> so, no network requests is perform before OverloadEJSCanvas is finished
[15:15:35] <Enelar> i trying change order: begin network request, and then overload
[15:15:46] <Enelar> no
[15:15:57] <Enelar> begin request, run A, end request, invoke CB
[15:16:00] <Enelar> now it is
[15:16:07] <robertmaxrees> "cb" = callback?
[15:16:10] <Enelar> run A, begin request, wait, end request, invoke CB
[15:16:24] <Enelar> yes, its $.ajax(cb);  (function() {})
[15:16:35] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah - put the ajax call in a callback of the "a" functoon.
[15:17:17] <Enelar> no, it still will be blocking execution. i need to begin ajax call _before_ A
[15:17:19] <sacho_> Enelar, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/basic_usage
[15:17:23] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: for what I understand those are not facet filters
[15:17:37] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 it looks like you'd use those to make facet filters.
[15:17:51] <Enelar> anyway guys, thanks i already get andwer: robertmaxress said that i should not rely on $.ajax
[15:17:54] <Enelar> so, i will not)
[15:17:56] <robertmaxrees> err.
[15:17:58] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[15:18:13] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: then, no that easy
[15:18:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said at all.
[15:18:33] <robertmaxrees> Enelar i said don't rely on it completing before other things - use the callbacks it exposes.
[15:18:41] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, i mean, i should not rely on order, sorry. I think setTimout will solve my problem
[15:18:49] <robertmaxrees> settimeout is code smell.
[15:18:53] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, yeah
[15:18:55] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 alright - dunno then.
[15:19:15] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, i have no choice, its only way to make "fork"
[15:19:36] <robertmaxrees> have you actually profiled your code btw?
[15:20:16] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, yeah
[15:20:24] <SmashingX2> dang, I spent 3 hours changing to datatables because “it was going to be easier than using tables” for nothing
[15:20:40] <Enelar> robertmaxrees, that place get 9% of time of initial bootstraping
[15:20:57] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 err, we were suggesting that you investigate it as an option.  surprised you just jumped in like that.
[15:21:13] <robertmaxrees> sorry if you got the wrong impression.
[15:21:40] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: no, you said tables were very hard for styles that they where a pain for filtering and all that
[15:21:51] <SmashingX2> it turns out that is the same thing with datatables
[15:21:58] <robertmaxrees> err...
[15:21:59] <Enelar> i know that my code smell, so sorry that i pointed it to you. have a good day!
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 you want filtering with tables.  that's exactly what datatables is designed to do.
[15:22:52] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: I remember I said I wasn’t going to use databases
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> and we suggested you avoid trying to style tables because it's a painb.
[15:23:48] <sacho_> Enelar, actually, placing it in a timeout is probably your only choice, since your requests won't be executed until the function actually finishes
[15:24:28] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: yeah so that’s why I tried it but now I am at the same point
[15:24:40] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[15:24:48] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i've seen other people accomplish what you're looking for before.
[15:24:52] <Enelar> sacho_, yeah, thanks. I abusing setTimeout in that project too much, i think noone will be noticed if i will use it once more :)
[15:25:38] <robertmaxrees> that's super funky.  interesting.
[15:25:43] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: well it would be useful to see working examples
[15:26:04] <SmashingX2> because I’ve been searching with no luck
[15:26:20] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/reference/api/filter%28%29
[15:26:41] <robertmaxrees> looks like you find the column, grab its data, then filter on that column.
[15:26:58] <robertmaxrees> that filter could be checking anything.
[15:28:16] <simpleuser> Hi there. I have a very strange problem. I make a request ajax with $.ajax, and I have to receive an object like { name: "foo", artist: "bar… }. If I check my firefox/chromium network analysis, everything is ok. If I make a console.log in request.done(function (myObj), the name property is undefined.
[15:28:34] <simpleuser> Is it a property jQuery does not like and remove it?
[15:28:59] <simpleuser> It is the only property with this problem. Every others are fine
[15:30:27] <robertmaxrees> console.log() the entire object, simpleuser
[15:30:54] <robertmaxrees> if the name object doesn't show, triple-check the structure.  if still no dice, try using square bracket notation to access it.
[15:32:31] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: but in those examples where is the actual filter object
[15:32:32] <SmashingX2> ?
[15:33:01] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/Vn4k8Sc.png
[15:33:24] <robertmaxrees> it shows you how to select the dable, get the datatables instance, and then call the method on the object you care about...
[15:34:47] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/3acd28d22185944feeca
[15:35:26] <robertmaxrees> simple oh so the property exists...  hrm....
[15:35:26] <simpleuser> Wow. The artist property was also truncated.
[15:35:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you have another problem it looks like.
[15:35:48] <simpleuser> What the hell… :(
[15:36:18] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're sending the same request each time?
[15:36:31] <simpleuser> It is valid json
[15:36:37] <simpleuser> Yeah
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:40:14] <simpleuser> Is there a way to have the exact url that has been passed to ajax? (in the done method)
[15:41:52] <robertmaxrees> might be in the jqXHR object.
[15:41:54] <robertmaxrees> third arg.
[15:42:11] <simpleuser> ok thanks
[15:45:12] <simpleuser> Oh god. robertmaxrees : Jquery has definitely a problem
[15:45:15] <baako> if I use $.ajax  or Query.ajax that does that add some kind of auth to your application?
[15:45:25] <simpleuser> I paste you my console log you'll see what I mean !
[15:45:30] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: :is not working for me :(
[15:45:49] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ SmashingX2
[15:45:49] <b-ot> SmashingX2: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:46:30] <simpleuser> Here is my console.log of my object (first argument of done method) https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/db369b2628c6ba4aa17e
[15:46:32] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser hrm...
[15:46:58] <robertmaxrees> go to the network tab of your dev tools and look for the response there.
[15:46:58] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: http://fixee.org/paste/qvss4x3/
[15:47:12] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/94a8427f953646524b20
[15:47:28] <simpleuser> ^ and here is the "responseText" property of the third argument
[15:47:42] <robertmaxrees> that's from postman or from the network tab?
[15:47:49] <simpleuser> console.log
[15:47:51] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 a fiddle maybe?
[15:47:52] <simpleuser> both
[15:47:54] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:48:05] <SmashingX2> fiddle/
[15:48:13] <SmashingX2> ahhh
[15:50:08] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser hrmmm... can you share a functioning example?  something seems strange here.
[15:51:13] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: Both console log, again : https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/d5219e5c7ff9a4287b6d
[15:51:19] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: what do you mean a function example?
[15:51:25] <simpleuser> functioning*
[15:51:50] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle, i mean.
[15:51:52] <robertmaxrees> that i can run.
[15:52:27] <simpleuser> Mmmm… Will be hard I guess, since my ajax is in local
[15:53:05] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:53:11] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were hitting another api.
[15:53:14] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/gc6nL03m/
[15:53:16] <robertmaxrees> check your character encodings.
[15:53:23] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: yep, but in php backend ;)
[15:53:35] <simpleuser> mm
[15:53:59] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 use the external resources for plugins.
[15:54:03] <robertmaxrees> not the javascript pane.
[15:54:21] <SmashingX2> but ther are some that are not external
[15:54:32] <robertmaxrees> right - your JS wouldn't be.  the libraries would be.
[15:57:41] <Lencl> hello
[15:57:42] <SmashingX2> http://jsfiddle.net/gc6nL03m/2/
[15:57:47] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: ^
[15:57:59] <Lencl> I was having this issue yesterday but can't solve it: http://jsfiddle.net/x4gkkrta/1/
[15:58:32] <robertmaxrees> lol SmashingX2
[15:59:45] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: Oh god… look at that https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/f6dfd97351b8c2dfc481
[16:00:02] <simpleuser> There is a problem with jQuery's json parser
[16:00:05] <SmashingX2> http://jsfiddle.net/gc6nL03m/3/
[16:00:47] <Lencl> how come every time I save on js fiddle, it opens a new page...
[16:00:58] <simpleuser> I have to parse myself the responseText of the third argument for now… No other choice
[16:00:58] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser i have my doubts, but feel free to submit a bug.
[16:01:09] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet your data isn't properly formatted.
[16:01:21] <simpleuser> Well, it is valid json according to linters
[16:01:33] <robertmaxrees> Lencl your code works for me.
[16:01:34] <simpleuser> And it's ok for every other parsers
[16:01:37] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser weird.
[16:01:41] <robertmaxrees> submit a bug then?
[16:01:42] <simpleuser> Indeed
[16:01:44] <simpleuser> Very weird
[16:01:50] <robertmaxrees> since that's pretty critical and all ;)
[16:02:03] <simpleuser> Yeah, I guess… Even if it is not easily reproductible
[16:02:12] <SmashingX2> whats funny robertmaxrees ?
[16:02:13] <robertmaxrees> anything helps.
[16:02:37] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 you're including stuff you don't need. http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gc6nL03m/4/ would have been plenty in this case.
[16:03:10] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: nope, the first row is not locked
[16:03:15] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:03:17] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:03:19] <SmashingX2> but whatever
[16:03:32] <robertmaxrees> in this case you're asking how to filter data.
[16:03:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:03:35] <SmashingX2> I just care about the freaking filters
[16:03:38] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[16:03:40] <SmashingX2> right
[16:08:30] <Lencl> I hate jsfiddle, doesn't let me save.
[16:08:32] <Lencl> http://pastebin.com/kv8qcBdR
[16:08:41] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:08:43] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[16:08:47] <Lencl> yeah
[16:08:53] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> use jsbin then?
[16:08:57] <Lencl> it opens a new page every time I update
[16:09:04] <robertmaxrees> whaaaa...
[16:09:05] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[16:09:10] <Lencl> yeah
[16:09:14] <Lencl> maybe it's a firefox issue
[16:09:18] <robertmaxrees> i use FF.
[16:09:19] <robertmaxrees> no issues.
[16:09:23] <Lencl> weird
[16:09:27] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 i'm looking through the docs for what you need.
[16:09:30] <Lencl> I click "Update" and it opens new page
[16:09:39] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're not holding down ctrl or anything?
[16:09:48] <Lencl> lol im sure
[16:09:51] <SmashingX2> thanks robertmaxrees I appreciate that.
[16:09:52] <code--shah> http://scrollsample.appspot.com/items
[16:09:58] <code--shah> how do they change the rel next / canonical etc.
[16:10:01] <code--shah> on the page view source
[16:10:06] <robertmaxrees> in their backend.
[16:10:11] <code--shah> 'cause ehwne I do it with jQuery it does not
[16:10:17] <code--shah> robertmaxrees, hmm, but it seems it does not do a reload
[16:10:35] <robertmaxrees> yep, it does.
[16:10:42] <code--shah> robertmaxrees, oh it does?
[16:10:45] <code--shah> hmm
[16:11:25] <code--shah> interesting!
[16:11:44] <SmashingX2> how are you looking to the docs, coding, answering questions at the same time robertmaxrees ?
[16:11:49] <SmashingX2> are you multithread?
[16:12:15] <robertmaxrees> .search() is the method you want btw - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gc6nL03m/5/
[16:12:46] <robertmaxrees> Lencl what's the issue you're having?
[16:13:09] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: Found the problem. Very long url in object properties make the jquery parser fail
[16:13:22] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser woah.  really?
[16:13:37] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: in this code: http://pastebin.com/kv8qcBdR it keeps saying e is undefined
[16:13:38] <simpleuser> If I remove it, everything is working perfectly fine
[16:13:48] <Lencl> and several places on my website as well, it does that
[16:13:57] <Lencl> but I don't get how it can go wrong
[16:13:57] <robertmaxrees> on what line, Lencl?
[16:14:09] <Lencl> line 10
[16:14:28] <Lencl> TypeError: e is undefined
[16:15:11] <robertmaxrees> btw - http://fixee.org/paste/dmewz7m/
[16:15:13] <robertmaxrees> a little cleaner.
[16:16:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9vg26pam/1/ works fine.  can't replicate the bug.
[16:16:39] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: that was it?
[16:16:43] <Lencl> ah true
[16:16:56] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gc6nL03m/5/ it's all here :)
[16:17:11] <Lencl> but do you think all the code I have after could possibly have it go wrong?
[16:17:21] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: but that search box was already there
[16:17:23] <Lencl> or maybe I'm doing an older jquery..
[16:17:26] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 ...
[16:17:31] <robertmaxrees> Lencl i cleaned all that code up to fix some issues.
[16:17:32] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: what’s new about that code?
[16:17:40] <simpleuser> Do we know which Parser jquery uses when we do an ajax request?
[16:17:46] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 that's searching on a specific column.
[16:17:57] <SmashingX2> ok
[16:18:06] <robertmaxrees> you can pass it any string you want.
[16:18:25] <SmashingX2> so you are saying that with that I can construct the facets?
[16:18:30] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 yes
[16:18:45] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: ok that sounds pretty difficult
[16:18:50] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[16:18:52] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty easy.
[16:19:01] <SmashingX2> and by the way
[16:19:05] <SmashingX2> type accountant
[16:19:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:19:13] <SmashingX2> and is not searching in just the first column
[16:19:21] <SmashingX2> search for accountant
[16:19:21] <robertmaxrees> ...right.
[16:19:25] <robertmaxrees> because that's the global search box.
[16:19:28] <robertmaxrees> ....
[16:19:30] <SmashingX2> ok, so then it doesn’t work
[16:19:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:19:39] <robertmaxrees> what are you 4expecting that box to do?
[16:19:51] <SmashingX2> ok, so then where is the one that searches on only the first column?
[16:19:59] <robertmaxrees> table.column(0).data().search('Jackson Bradshaw').draw();
[16:20:10] <SmashingX2> I thought that’s what that search input suppose to do
[16:20:17] <robertmaxrees> see how, on load, you only have "jackson bradshaw" showing?
[16:20:25] <SmashingX2> yeah so?
[16:20:36] <Lencl> robertmaxrees: function has to end with a semicolon?
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> you could build this out to filter anything at any time.
[16:20:47] <robertmaxrees> Lencl when you declare like that, yeah.
[16:20:53] <Lencl> ah
[16:21:01] <Lencl> it seems to work without it o_O
[16:21:06] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> it's technically an error though.
[16:21:43] <SmashingX2> can you show me an example on how can I have that option?
[16:21:49] <SmashingX2> I just think is too difficult
[16:21:51] <Lencl> i have other functions on top of it.. so could this possibly give the e undefined error?
[16:22:01] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gc6nL03m/6/
[16:22:11] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you might have other code errors causing problems, yes.
[16:24:50] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 even further: Gloria Little
[16:25:18] <SmashingX2> what about her?
[16:25:20] <robertmaxrees> woops - i meant http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gc6nL03m/8/
[16:25:44] <SmashingX2> ok got it
[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> that all making sense now?
[16:36:40] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: yeah now is clear
[16:36:44] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: thanks man
[16:38:08] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: just one more question,
[16:38:33] <JamesSmith> Hey there guys!
[16:39:04] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 fsho
[16:39:14] <robertmaxrees> whuddup JamesSmith
[16:39:30] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: I posted my problem on Jquery's forum, we'll see ;)
[16:39:33] <JamesSmith> Mmm, i just need help making script for form validation
[16:39:48] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser hrm.  so not sure if it's a legit bug?
[16:40:19] <baako> I am using $("#add_err").html("<img src='img/ajax-loader.gif' /> Loading..."); in an ajax beforeSend function. in the complete function i want to remove this. how can i do this
[16:40:33] <robertmaxrees> $('#add_err').remove();
[16:40:37] <simpleuser> robertmaxrees: I don't know… And even though, I always prefer to get some answers first
[16:40:44] <robertmaxrees> simpleuser fair enough.
[16:41:05] <JamesSmith> Form validation help please
[16:41:11] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ JamesSmith
[16:41:11] <b-ot> JamesSmith: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:41:33] <kevireilly> baako: or $('#add_err').empty(); if you want to keep the add_err element on the DOM
[16:41:35] <JamesSmith> i did
[16:42:01] <baako> kevireilly: thanks
[16:42:04] <robertmaxrees> JamesSmith you said you need help - you weren't really specific ;) what do you need help doing?
[16:42:14] <JamesSmith> i said form validation help
[16:42:26] <robertmaxrees> JamesSmith lol that's a really broad topic.  what about it?
[16:42:39] <kevireilly> baako: oh no problem, i was just adding on to robertmaxrees answer regarding $('#add_err').remove();
[16:43:08] <JamesSmith> im making a registration page, i need help making form validation show error next to the input but i dont anything in javascript
[16:43:11] <baako> robertmaxrees: thanks :D
[16:43:12] <JamesSmith> like... 0%
[16:43:55] <SmashingX2> I’m trying also to do something like if I choose a button that says all available and what it would do is to retrieve all the elements from the first column without repetition to a list so I can choose from those as a filter
[16:44:03] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: does that make sense?
[16:46:03] <SmashingX2> I was just wondering if you have seen that before
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> JamesSmith woah.  that's... a mountain.
[16:46:44] <JamesSmith> what do you mean? is it hard?
[16:46:50] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 yep - that should be easy.
[16:47:08] <robertmaxrees> JamesSmith it'll take a lot of learning.
[16:47:10] <SmashingX2> good to know
[16:47:18] <robertmaxrees> check out the jquery validate plugin for starters, JamesSmith
[16:47:25] <SmashingX2> robertmaxrees: do you know how can I start then because I don’t have a clue lol
[16:47:36] <JamesSmith> even for that simple red text and border beside form input?
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> JamesSmith how many fields?
[16:47:59] <JamesSmith> what's that? i mean, is that a topic or what? i would search it on google
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> JamesSmith jquery validate is a plugin.
[16:48:14] <robertmaxrees> makes form validation easier.
[16:48:36] <JamesSmith> hmmm, even format checking too?
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 use the datatables api to get you a list of all the values in a column, then dedupe the list and make your links or whatever.
[16:49:12] <JamesSmith> found it! :D
[16:49:19] <SmashingX2> databases api?
[16:49:27] <SmashingX2> even though Im not using any database?
[16:49:28] <robertmaxrees> datatables
[16:49:35] <robertmaxrees> not databases.
[16:50:44] <SmashingX2> oh f*** sorry
[16:50:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:50:54] <SmashingX2> I think I’ve working for enough time
[16:51:40] <SmashingX2> ok I will start doing that when I finish with this crap
[16:51:45] <SmashingX2> thanks man
[17:25:08] <rbo> hey :)

[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> :(*
[18:56:15] <greenshirt> hello ...
[18:56:38] <greenshirt> how i can validate form inside bootstrap modal when i using knockoutjs ?
[18:56:56] <greenshirt> i dont see any relevant documentation or similar
[19:48:22] <Prometheian> I'm trying to pull the data found at http://gomashup.com/json.php?fds=finance/fortune500/year/2009&jsoncallback=? and the only way to get it to allow a CORS request is with that exact url. However in my attempts to get the data I keep getting an error about missing } after property list. I'm unsure what steps I need to take to correctly access this data.
[19:50:22] <BillCriswell> Prometheian: I think you want to use jsonp
[19:50:38] <Prometheian> hmm, I'll give that a shot
[19:52:07] <Prometheian> Still same error.
[19:52:30] <Prometheian> But I was able to adjust the error.
[19:52:34] <Prometheian> url*
[19:52:38] <blackhajime> Anyone have experiences with knockoutjs and formvalidation for bootstrap?
[19:52:47] <Prometheian> I think the data's bad somewhere.
[19:53:33] <BillCriswell> Prometheian: Yeah the json is bad.
[19:53:46] <Prometheian> kk, I just pulled it out and manually purged it
[19:53:56] <BillCriswell> "Company" : "Toys R"" Us"""
[19:54:17] <Prometheian> Debating going through the trouble of putting it into my DB and ajaxing it to be fancy, or saying screw it and shoving it into a file and abusing it.
[19:54:31] <Prometheian> I think I'm going to go with abuse it.
[19:54:36] <BillCriswell> Haha
[19:55:11] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON('http://gomashup.com/json.php?fds=finance/fortune500/year/2009&callback=?').done(function(result) { console.log(result); }); would be how you'd do it with valid JSON
[19:55:28] <Prometheian> $.getJSON, not just $.get?
[19:56:01] <BillCriswell> I'm not positive.
[19:56:34] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/ I'm just going by the jsonp section here.
[19:57:04] <Prometheian> kk, well I've done jsonp stuff with Blizzards api but that was actually valid json :D
[19:57:12] <blackhajime> I want to validate form inside bootstrap modal .. but its bind with knockout js data-bind
[19:57:40] <blackhajime> I try hard to make validation working..but its fail
[19:58:14] <Prometheian> blackhajime: Apply validation after knockout binding maybe
[20:00:30] <blackhajime> Prometheian: there are knockout-validation plugin using ko extenders ... but i think formvalidation.io was great validation library for bootstrap ...
[20:01:02] <Prometheian> Dunno :/ I generally do validation outside of my frontend framework
[20:01:34] <blackhajime> Prometheian: at the server side ?
[20:14:28] <Prometheian> No, just do a check before post.
[20:14:50] <blackhajime> I'm still noob
[20:15:10] <Prometheian> I check the information before it's sent to the server.
[20:15:17] <Prometheian> And then have server side restrictions.
[21:06:04] <chequers> hi, I'm filling a table with data from an array, and hte code looks like this:
[21:06:10] <chequers> _.each(games, function(e) { tr = $( "<tr>" ); tr.append("<td>" + e['name'] + "</td>");
[21:06:24] <chequers> there's a lot of tr.append lines... is there a more sensible way to write this?
[21:11:02] <doug16k> does anyone know why jquery's documentation for authoring plugins http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/ demonstrates assigning directly to $.fn properties, yet there is a method for doing it here: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.fn.extend/
[21:12:30] <doug16k> chequers, yes, that is an XSS vulnerability right there
[21:13:06] <doug16k> what if the "name" is <script>alert('pwnd!!');</script>   or worse, something that steals your session
[21:13:39] <doug16k> or even worse, a CSRF vulnerability
[21:13:51] <chequers> doug16k: oh, how should I prevent that?
[21:14:32] <doug16k> chequers,  tr.append($("<td/>").text(e['name']));
[21:15:01] <doug16k> .text will properly escape the text so < will become &gt; (for example) instead of letting it be a script tag
[21:15:04] <chequers> ah, that's cleaner too, so two for one
[21:15:12] <doug16k> &lt;*
[21:15:46] <doug16k> chequers, that code will work with a document fragment, so it is faster than it looks
[21:16:08] <chequers> i'm not overly worried about speed, there are <100 elements, but it's nice to know
[21:18:28] <doug16k> chequers, the other way to create elements is like this: $('<td/>', { text: e.name })
[21:18:36] <doug16k> take your pick :)
[21:18:58] <chequers> that's a bit too unfamiliar for me atm :)
[21:19:22] <chequers> how should I deal with nested elements? a few of the tds are text wrapped in <a>
[21:19:43] <chequers> tr.append($("<td/>").append($("<a/").text(foo)?
[21:20:02] <chequers> well, I guess that doesn't set the href, so I need the second method for doing a one-liner a?
[21:20:11] <doug16k> chequers, that would work
[21:20:32] <doug16k> you can use .attr('href', x)
[21:20:36] <doug16k> where x is the url
[21:20:37] <rbo> http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/ Sweet stuff ;)
[21:21:03] <chequers> doug16k: oh, .text().attr() would do what I want?
[21:21:07] <doug16k> yes
[21:21:07] <chequers> jquery continue to surprise
[21:21:24] <chequers> I guess every element modifier returns the element?
[21:21:32] <doug16k> it returns the jquery
[21:21:45] <doug16k> $('.foo').text()   <-- returns the "$('.foo') result
[21:21:58] <chequers> ahhh
[21:24:08] <doug16k> or said more precisely: $('.foo') creates an object and returns it. the .text call calls text on that object. .text returns 'this', so it is as though the .text isn't there, any following method call will also call into the same jquery selector
[21:24:42] <doug16k> things like .children don't return it, but you can "go back to it" with .end()
[21:25:27] <doug16k> $('.foo').children('.bar').css('color', 'red').end().text('baz')
[21:25:46] <doug16k> sets the children of .bar to red, then goes back to the .foo one and sets its text to baz
[21:26:05] <doug16k> oops I mean
[21:26:15] <doug16k> sets the children of .foo that have class .bar to red, then goes back to the .foo one and sets its text to baz
[21:26:35] <chequers> oh, bonus of using .text() -- if I set text() to an undefined variable it doesn't literally print 'undefined' on the page!
[21:26:45] <chequers> would you sanity check my JS? it's inline here https://crawl.project357.org/static/dcss-web/watch.htm
[21:26:49] <doug16k> sure
[21:27:50] <doug16k> not a problem, but e['name'] is the same thing as e.name
[21:28:12] <chequers> like, literally identical? no instance when it's different?
[21:28:19] <doug16k> totally identical
[21:28:24] <chequers> dang
[21:28:39] <doug16k> if you had spaces or weird characters in there where 'name' is, then what you do now is good
[21:28:56] <chequers> this is so different from python :)
[21:29:00] <doug16k> you could make a property with spaces in it with obj[string] syntax
[21:29:40] <doug16k> you need the funny / in there on line 21
[21:29:45] <doug16k> $('<tr/>')
[21:29:55] <doug16k> if you HATE that, then you need $('<tr></tr>')
[21:30:16] <doug16k> you need to say the closing somehow if it is a tag name that needs to be closed
[21:30:53] <doug16k> line 32 repeatedly looks up the elements
[21:31:11] <doug16k> $( "#livegames tbody" ) should be assigned to a variable and reused every loop
[21:31:21] <doug16k> assigned outside the loop of course
[21:32:10] <doug16k> line 36 has no effect
[21:32:51] <chequers> I can get used to <tr/>
[21:33:26] <doug16k> it's just shorthand - jquery is parsing that and it looks for the slash. don't worry that it is xhtml syntax, it wont end up that way by the time the DOM sees it
[21:34:00] <Uhkis> if you only use underscore.js for that loop, you could ditch it and use jQuery.each()
[21:34:16] <chequers> dang. i spent 5mins looking through the documentation for a jquery each
[21:34:29] <rbo> lol
[21:34:39] <chequers> i also use underscore for random selection of elements from an array
[21:34:43] <doug16k> chequers, warning: the parameters are not the same as ES5 .forEach
[21:34:44] <rbo> Is there any "easy" way to understand documentation better?
[21:34:56] <chequers> and shuffling
[21:35:25] <chequers> doug16k: I'll skip the caching of $( "#livegames tbody" ) just because I'm not too worried about performance and more about clarity
[21:35:37] <chequers> doug16k: what do you mean line 36 has no effect?
[21:35:52] <doug16k> chequers, it does nothing but build a document fragment then throws it away
[21:36:01] <doug16k> right?
[21:36:02] <Uhkis> #36 is a <script> end tag?
[21:36:19] <doug16k> no in the resulting page: $( $.get("dgl-status.json", fillPlayerTable ));
[21:36:21] <chequers> so $.get("dgl-status.json", fillPlayerTable ) would be the same thing?
[21:36:47] <doug16k> ah, I see what you are doing
[21:36:48] <chequers> that is just my confusion about how to call into jquery from top level I guess
[21:37:22] <doug16k> chequers, it is quite a bit clearer (IMHO) to say: $.get('dgl-status.json').done(fillPlayerTable)
[21:37:27] <doug16k> ;
[21:37:52] <chequers> clearer for me too :)
[21:38:01] <doug16k> and if you want to handle error, tack .fail(function() { alert('network error'); }) or somehing nicer than alert
[21:38:08] <doug16k> onto the end
[21:38:09] <doug16k> it chains too
[21:38:45] <doug16k> if you want the caller to be able to know when it is finished, return it too
[21:39:22] <doug16k> so, it could say: return $.get("dgl-status.json").done(fillPlayerTable).fail(handleNetworkError);
[21:39:40] <doug16k> then the caller can also "know" when it is done by tacking its own .done onto it
[21:39:55] <chequers> I'm not sure I follow
[21:40:03] <chequers> the caller is $.get, right?
[21:40:11] <doug16k> ah it isnt a function
[21:40:13] <doug16k> ok nevermind
[21:41:03] <doug16k> but if you had put that in a function, say, getAndFillPlayerTable(), then it could return the $.get result, then the caller can know when it is done too
[21:41:51] <doug16k> as is, the code has no way of really knowing when it is done. that might not matter, but if it does matter, that's how you can know when the whole ajax request and table fill are done
[21:42:01] <chequers> ah
[21:42:12] <doug16k> chequers, you can tack as many .done and .fail on there as you want
[21:42:18] <chequers> i need to understand jquery promises and deferring sometime soon i think
[21:42:19] <doug16k> even after it is complete
[21:42:37] <doug16k> it's a lot easier than it looks actually
[21:42:42] <chequers> like, it would be cool to start the get as soon as the page loads, but only run the callback once the table is in the dom
[21:43:02] <doug16k> chequers, exactly. you should start that request eve before document ready
[21:43:06] <doug16k> even*
[21:43:26] <doug16k> and assign it to something, then you can just put that variable where you have the $.get now
[21:43:53] <doug16k> that way, it will start the request long before the page displays a thing
[21:44:06] <doug16k> (depending on where your script is)
[21:44:16] <chequers> so: data = $.get() ; data.done(callback); ?
[21:44:25] <doug16k> var data = $.get...    yes
[21:44:33] <doug16k> if you don't say "var" it will be global
[21:44:45] <chequers> that's a useful thing to learn
[21:44:47] <doug16k> in your exact code, it will be global anyway... ideally js code should go in an IIFE
[21:45:12] <doug16k> "var" at the top level (not inside a function) declares a global
[21:45:28] <doug16k> var inside a function makes it a local variable (local to that function)
[21:45:30] <chequers> so var implies a scope-level variable?
[21:45:34] <doug16k> yes
[21:45:35] <chequers> *current-scope
[21:46:21] <doug16k> correct
[21:46:51] <chequers> is there some way to make a $.get deliberately fail for testing my .fail condition?
[21:47:17] <doug16k> chequers, put http://nonexistent/  at the start of the url
[21:47:24] <doug16k> it will fail because it is crossdomain
[21:47:44] <doug16k> and the dns will fail too, so it will super-fail :D
[21:48:37] <doug16k> kiddin
[21:48:38] <doug16k> g
[21:49:11] <chequers> :)
[21:51:26] <rbo> trying me some JSON right now
[21:52:05] <doug16k> rbo, I found a really good jquery browser a while back. let me see if I can find it again. it helped me learn jquery pretty fast
[21:52:12] <doug16k> doc browser*
[21:52:24] <chequers> doug16k: thanks for your help, the chaining advice will fix some other XSS elsewhere :)
[21:55:40] <doug16k> chequers, if you find yourself building up an unreasonable amount of html in your code, you should probably switch to a template-driven design
[21:55:58] <doug16k> generally, generating html in js is not recommended
[21:56:30] <doug16k> it is better to .detach() some template from the dom, that you wrote as actual html (perhaps a child of a hidden element)
[21:57:20] <chequers> oh, so hardcode the template into my html and set style=hidden?
[21:57:27] <doug16k> then, in your loop, you could instead do something like $('[data-bind]').each(function() { var elem = $(this), prop = elem.attr('data-bind'); elem.text(someObject[prop]); })
[21:57:37] <doug16k> on a clone of it
[21:57:59] <doug16k> let me make you an example
[21:58:06] <chequers> yeah.. that line a bit confusing sorry
[21:59:47] <doug16k> rbo, http://jqapi.com/
[22:03:15] <Uhkis> oh that's nice
[22:05:59] <enigmabomb> Hey guys
[22:06:29] <doug16k> chequers, http://www.jstraight.com/1213/1
[22:06:45] <enigmabomb> I’m having a hard time with a selector. Any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/ju3usv9w/
[22:06:52] <doug16k> chequers, if a separate guy that isn't great at js is doing your html/css, he will love you for using templates
[22:07:26] <rbo> Thanks doug16k :)
[22:07:59] <rbo> OMG, bookmarked it too doug16k
[22:08:12] <doug16k> chequers, you probably dont want designers coming after you every time they want to change something like that
[22:08:28] <doug16k> templates = massive designer freedom
[22:08:33] <enigmabomb> What can I do to output variables in jsfiddle
[22:08:53] <doug16k> enigmabomb, press F12 in the browser to bring up the debugger...
[22:08:58] <doug16k> go to the "console" tab
[22:09:07] <doug16k> in your code, call console.log or console.dir
[22:09:14] <rbo> doug16k.... you're a saviour.
[22:09:15] <enigmabomb> If I do console.log in jsfiddle it goes in there?
[22:09:19] <doug16k> yes
[22:09:28] <Uhkis> enigmabomb: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3usv9w/1/
[22:09:31] <rbo> I have been looking for something like this for a longtime. :)
[22:10:09] <enigmabomb> Uhkis: Thank you
[22:11:26] <doug16k> enigmabomb, console.dir emits a thing that lets you browse through object properties. if you want to "log" a complex object variable, use console.dir
[22:11:46] <enigmabomb> oh awesome, like a var_dump style output
[22:11:52] <doug16k> yeah
[22:11:56] <enigmabomb> Sweet
[22:13:39] <chequers> doug16k: thanks, that makes more sense now
[22:14:34] <doug16k> chequers, np
[22:15:22] <Uhkis> this doug16k is so much better than the 64k version :D
[22:16:32] <doug16k> :D
[22:17:08] <Uhkis> oh, console.dir just makes it harder to read
[22:17:27] <Uhkis> on firebug at least
[22:17:43] <doug16k> really? try console.dir(document)
[22:17:51] <doug16k> you should be able to browse through all the properties
[22:18:07] <Uhkis> same exact thing as log but not browsable
[22:18:25] <doug16k> ah, well the builtin consoles in chrome and ff will show a "good" thing for dir
[22:19:57] <doug16k> I quit using firebug a while ago. the built-in debugger is actually decent in FF now. almost as good as chrome's
[22:20:12] <doug16k> the FF debugger is arguably better for inspecting the DOM
[22:21:14] <k1ng> hello, i am looking for frontend developer. anyone interested to work?
[22:21:16] <rbo> doug16k, I hate to say this, but IE's latest is pretty good too.
[22:22:19] <Uhkis> what? chromes tools have become usable? ;)
[22:22:57] <doug16k> Uhkis, if you avoid reloading when paused at a breakpoint, it mostly works. it is still a tiny bit unstable, but only when I am "mean" to it
[22:23:56] <enigmabomb> doug16k: It doesn’t work when I take it out of fiddle. Any pointers?
[22:25:12] <doug16k> enigmabomb, where is the script tag with that code? in <head> or before </body>?
[22:25:36] <enigmabomb> I have a .js file included. Oddly, the add form field js works but the remove does not
[22:26:19] <doug16k> enigmabomb, this should work regardless of where the script is: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3usv9w/2/
[22:26:40] <doug16k> passing a function to $ is the same as $(document).ready(...
[22:27:00] <doug16k> enigmabomb, do you dynamically create those elements?
[22:27:05] <enigmabomb> yep
[22:27:36] <enigmabomb> Does the dom not get updated after I create those elements?
[22:28:22] <doug16k> enigmabomb, this will work no matter when you create them http://jsfiddle.net/ju3usv9w/3/
[22:28:46] <Uhkis> then you need $(pre-existing-parent-element).on('click', '.remove', function() {} );
[22:29:35] <enigmabomb> doug16k: Interesting, that works in fiddle but throws “ Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined” in chrome
[22:29:55] <enigmabomb> Scratch that it doesnt work in fiddle either
[22:29:58] <doug16k> enigmabomb, then the thing you clicked doesn't have an id attribute
[22:30:20] <doug16k> ah ok, let me look
[22:32:21] <enigmabomb> Uhkis: A separate function?
[22:33:00] <doug16k> enigmabomb, http://jsfiddle.net/ju3usv9w/4/
[22:33:08] <doug16k> I added a class to each item "item"
[22:33:30] <doug16k> the closest function looks upwards through the parents until it finds the whole "item" element
[22:34:05] <doug16k> this relaxes the dependency on an exact dom structure
[22:34:48] <doug16k> as long as each deletable thing has class "item" it will work no matter how complex the elemnt structure
[22:35:11] <enigmabomb> Is the class “checklistitem”
[22:35:26] <doug16k> that is just the input
[22:36:02] <doug16k> if it was meant to mean a whole "row" then it should be on line 2 or the html
[22:36:03] <enigmabomb> Ah I see class item
[22:36:15] <doug16k> of*
[22:36:32] <doug16k> ...and line 13
[22:36:52] <enigmabomb> It works!
[22:37:02] <enigmabomb> Thank you so much doug16k … as you can tell I’m still learning.
[22:37:12] <rbo> omg
[22:37:18] <rbo> SVG animations *** splurge ***
[22:37:21] <caper> is there any one familiar with bandwidth api
[22:37:23] <doug16k> .closest is amazingly useful for dealing with row-line things
[22:37:33] <doug16k> row-like*
[22:37:58] <doug16k> you can start at some random descendent of .item and navigate up to it so easily with .closest
[22:39:49] <doug16k> caper, you found this already right? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Connection.bandwidth
[22:40:22] <doug16k> looks like it is FF-only though
[22:40:33] <caper> dude bandwidth is a DID management
[22:40:51] <doug16k> what?
[22:41:34] <doug16k> Voip thing?
[22:42:40] <Uhkis> jquery should make an alias nearest of closest, i ALWAYS type nearest first just to get not a function error :D
[22:43:18] <doug16k> Uhkis, for a while I thought "nearest" when I meant closest too
[22:44:13] <doug16k> I guess it's better than .ancestor, although it would improve developer spelling :D
[22:44:50] <doug16k> then .find would be descendent. ya, maybe a bad idea :)
[22:44:51] <caper> yes voip thing diug16k
[22:45:05] <caper> sorry doug16k
[22:45:40] <d3m0n> Hey guys, what would be the best way to make each progress bar indivdual of each other http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/bNveYJ
[22:47:06] <d3m0n> Maybe a foreach?
[22:47:57] <doug16k> a class name that identifies the purpose of the bar, or a unique id attribute, or, refer to them by index
[22:48:58] <d3m0n> class name wouldnt work becaue I want it to run on all the bars automatically without having to had unique identifier
[22:49:11] <d3m0n> have a*
[22:49:15] <doug16k> same value on all bars?
[22:49:21] <d3m0n> No
[22:49:40] <doug16k> I think I know what you are asking...
[22:49:42] <d3m0n> Right now it grabs the value from all the texts
[22:49:52] <doug16k> you want to know how to limit the scope if the selectors?
[22:49:56] <d3m0n> Instead of running the function on each individual bar
[22:50:27] <doug16k> ah ok so you have some array of 3 values and you want to set all 3 at once?
[22:50:45] <d3m0n> correct
[22:51:06] <doug16k> I'll fork it and see what I can come up with
[22:51:08] <d3m0n> But the function collects all the values and spits them out as one value on all the bars
[22:54:03] <morenoh149> what can cause an ajax error?
[22:54:28] <morenoh149> I"m seeing `http://localhost:7000/ 404 (Not Found)` so is it trying to redirect after the ajax request?
[22:55:34] <doug16k> d3m0n, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GgxqVe
[22:55:56] <doug16k> d3m0n, the 2nd parameter to $ means, start looking here and descendents
[22:56:43] <d3m0n> Aha! Exactly what i was looking for, tyvm doug16k
[22:56:48] <doug16k> morenoh149, press F12, go to the "network" or "net" tab, reload
[22:56:52] <doug16k> d3m0n, np
[22:58:04] <doug16k> d3m0n, the assignment to elem is not needed, it's my convention to use "elem" as the "this element in the loop" variable. you don't really need that assignment to elem
[22:59:20] <morenoh149> doug16k: its says method: delete, 404 not found, localhost:7000/logout redirect
[22:59:29] <morenoh149> so the server told the client to redirect?
[22:59:35] <d3m0n> doug16k: this is probably a dumb question but I don't see you passing any value through domElem
[22:59:50] <doug16k> it's the parameter in the each callback
[23:00:24] <doug16k> the ".each" iterates the matching elements
[23:00:37] <doug16k> each call to that functon, domElem is the matching .progress-border
[23:00:55] <doug16k> i would be 0, 1, 2, etc
[23:00:59] <d3m0n> ohh so domEle == this
[23:01:06] <doug16k> ya
[23:01:11] <d3m0n> Awesome ty :)
[23:01:17] <doug16k> sorry been doing ES5 stuff too much lately :D
[23:01:33] <doug16k> you are correct that "this" and that 2nd parameter are identical
[23:02:21] <doug16k> morenoh149, you clicked it?
[23:02:28] <doug16k> what do the response headers say?
[23:02:44] <doug16k> (clicked the row in the network pane)
[23:04:03] <rbo> woah
[23:04:06] <morenoh149> doug16k: thanks alot solved it
[23:04:17] <doug16k> np
[23:04:30] <morenoh149> the server was responding to redirect. Now it responds success
[23:07:36] <jqueryius> Hi, this is my scenario.I have Datatables to display data in a table. But I want a user to be able to click on a list of pre-existing search terms somewhere, and then it loads the table.... this is not my problem though
[23:07:50] <jqueryius> How do I physically get the search text into the datatables Search box?
[23:08:06] <jqueryius> it's class is = form-control input-sm........ but it has no id
[23:08:39] <rbo> give it an id
[23:08:56] <jqueryius> i can't because it is part of datatables
[23:09:13] <doug16k> jqueryius, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5990386/datatables-search-box-outside-datatable
[23:09:16] <jqueryius> I just specify the table, the .DataTable() does it
[23:09:33] <doug16k> jqueryius, key part: oTable.search($(this).val()).draw()
[23:09:47] <doug16k> replace $(this).val() with your search term
[23:10:05] <jqueryius> whoa, i'm a bit confused by that
[23:10:12] <jqueryius> i don't need to add another search box
[23:10:21] <jqueryius> i'm happy with the current one, i just want to put text in it
[23:10:33] <doug16k> that's what it does
[23:10:48] <jqueryius> but how can I do it before the initial dataset loads?
[23:11:00] <jqueryius> in jquery, how can I tell when that box becomes visible?
[23:11:57] <jqueryius> I've worked out that I can add: "deferLoading": 0,    and it will stop the initial data loading
[23:12:08] <doug16k> jqueryius, http://datatables.net/reference/event/init
[23:13:06] <doug16k> or, it fires this event after completing an ajax request http://datatables.net/reference/event/xhr
[23:13:25] <jqueryius> okay, so i've got this:
[23:13:27] <jqueryius>  var tasksTable = $('#tasks-table').DataTable( {... etc
[23:13:38] <jqueryius> Then tasksTable.init(function() { alert('test'); });
[23:13:49] <jqueryius> but the alert never happens so it mustn't be firing
[23:14:09] <doug16k> jqueryius, no you need to listen for that event
[23:14:24] <doug16k> tasksTable.on('xhr', function() ...
[23:15:03] <doug16k> I think
[23:15:12] <jqueryius> just tried
[23:15:13] <jqueryius> $('#tasks-table').on('init.dt', function() {
[23:15:14] <jqueryius> and
[23:15:15] <doug16k> based on a quick skim of their docs
[23:15:20] <jqueryius> tasksTable.on('init.dt', function() {
[23:15:22] <jqueryius> and neither fired
[23:16:11] <doug16k> jqueryius, attach the event listener before .dataTables()
[23:16:36] <doug16k> $('#tasks-table').on('init.dt', ... ).dataTables()
[23:16:43] <jqueryius> ok, one moment
[23:17:23] <jqueryius> no luck
[23:17:36] <doug16k> anything in the debugger console?
[23:17:51] <jqueryius> if I remove the "deferLoading": 0, then it works
[23:18:07] <jqueryius> but that defeats the purpose because it starts loading data before I have a chance to inject the search term
[23:18:20] <jqueryius> maybe init() only works once the data has loaded
[23:18:32] <doug16k> you dont even get an init event?
[23:19:15] <doug16k> there's a preXhr event too - you get that before it requests the data
[23:19:23] <jqueryius> i tried that, it doesn't work the first time
[23:19:33] <jqueryius> only thereafter (ie. searching, column sorting, etc)
[23:19:52] <jqueryius> thats why i used deferLoading because preXhr didnt work
[23:20:28] <jqueryius> is there any jquery magic I can use to "listen" for new html being injected?
[23:20:37] <jqueryius> ie. once that search box class appears, then add text to it
[23:20:54] <doug16k> jqueryius, the 'search' event might do what you want http://datatables.net/reference/event/search
[23:21:07] <doug16k> it fires it at each full redraw
[23:21:20] <doug16k> you could use .one to make it only catch the first time it fires
[23:21:29] <doug16k> .one vs .on
[23:21:49] <jqueryius> but I can't pass my search terms into that I don't think
[23:21:55] <jqueryius> it would just pick up when a search occurs
[23:22:32] <doug16k> yeah search is no good
[23:23:33] <doug16k> jqueryius, are you sure preXhr is missed first time? you probably needed to attach the event listener before calling .dataTables()
[23:24:08] <doug16k> listening for it with .one will make it only handle the first time it happens
[23:24:10] <jqueryius> let me try
[23:24:57] <jqueryius> good idea doug16k
[23:25:03] <jqueryius> attaching it first looks like it might work
[23:25:08] <jqueryius> let me experiment a bit more
[23:25:34] <jqueryius> yes, very good...
[23:26:02] <jqueryius> now you reckon try oTable.search( $(this).val() ).draw(); ?
[23:26:16] <doug16k> almost. don't say $(this).val()
[23:26:32] <doug16k> replace that with whatever variable is the search term
[23:26:33] <jqueryius> ok
[23:26:38] <jqueryius> what about the oTable bit
[23:26:44] <doug16k> keep that
[23:26:55] <jqueryius> var tasksTable = $('#tasks-table').on(.... tasksTable.search
[23:26:58] <jqueryius> would that work?
[23:27:08] <doug16k>  oTable.search(searchTerm).draw()
[23:27:11] <jqueryius> referencing itself
[23:27:17] <jqueryius>     var tasksTable = $('#tasks-table')             .on('preXhr.dt', function() {                 tasksTable.search('{{ searchTerm }}').draw();
[23:27:18] <doug16k> that should set the search text and force a redraw
[23:27:27] <doug16k> ah
[23:27:30] <doug16k> not oTable
[23:28:18] <doug16k> does angular replace inside scripts? I doubt it
[23:28:26] <doug16k> it is handlebars or somethibg?
[23:28:42] <jqueryius> hmm, nope tasksTable.search doesn't do the trick
[23:28:45] <doug16k> is this code in a controller or a directive or something
[23:28:56] <jqueryius> nah, it's just plain jquery
[23:29:00] <doug16k> jqueryius, test it with a hardcoded string 1st
[23:29:04] <jqueryius> i did
[23:29:08] <jqueryius> .search('test')
[23:29:10] <doug16k> tasksTable.search('foo').draw()
[23:29:30] <jqueryius> oh... that {{ searchTerm }} stuff?
[23:29:35] <jqueryius> yeah that's just symfony
[23:29:43] <jqueryius> it's inside a twig file
[23:29:48] <jqueryius> I replaced that with 'test' though
[23:29:54] <doug16k> you're sure that is getting replaced then
[23:29:55] <doug16k> ok
[23:30:07] <jqueryius> it just loads forever
[23:30:18] <jqueryius> i wonder if its doing something recursive
[23:30:39] <doug16k> jqueryius, you can set an initial search term in the options: http://datatables.net/reference/option/search.search
[23:31:08] <rbo> I'm trying to figure out why this code doesn't work properly... http://codepen.io/anon/pen/QwmKyN
[23:31:11] <doug16k> tasksTable.dataTables({ search: { search: 'test' }})
[23:31:20] <jqueryius> doug16k... no way :(
[23:31:25] <jqueryius> surely it hasn't been that easy the whole time
[23:31:27] <rbo> uh doug16k ... you're too good :P
[23:31:28] <jqueryius> let me try
[23:31:41] <doug16k> rbo, lol
[23:31:46] <doug16k> thanks
[23:33:06] <jqueryius> you are a legend doub16k
[23:33:18] <doug16k> glad to help
[23:33:29] <jqueryius> I put this on SO about half an hour ago: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28577797/datatables-prepopulate-search-box
[23:33:38] <jqueryius> if you reply let me give you the tick for it
[23:34:21] <rbo> doug16k It's been driving me nuts because i don't know what i'm doing...
[23:37:26] <rbo> I guess thats a bad example...
[23:38:06] <doug16k> jqueryius, I lost my old account, doug65536 (I gave up trying to recover my gmail password)
[23:38:29] <jqueryius> ah ok, well... still, thanks heaps for your help
[23:38:40] <jqueryius> i'll put the answer there myself to help others in the future
[23:38:41] <doug16k> I answered with my new one
[23:39:05] <jqueryius> oh, right
[23:39:30] <jqueryius> done :)
[23:40:07] <doug16k> thanks, now I can finally comment again lol
[23:42:03] <doug16k> rbo, don't worry, jquery gets easy pretty fast once you get going
[23:43:04] <doug16k> answering (or at least attempting to answer) random questions in here makes you learn extremely quickly
[23:46:51] <jqueryius> doug16k, i've got one other minor question - this is not as important, but i think it's more of a pure jquery thing
[23:47:01] <jqueryius> this code is what is generated by datatables: http://pastebin.com/dVGnDauB
[23:47:24] <jqueryius> it puts the "Showing 1 of 1 tasks" type thing on the bottom left, and the "Previous 1 2 3 Next" paging thing on the bottom right
[23:47:30] <jqueryius> is it possible to swap those two around?
[23:47:39] <jqueryius> so paging is on the left, "1 of 1 tasks" is on the right?
[23:50:48] <doug16k> jqueryius, you can customize the footer with the footerCallback option https://datatables.net/reference/option/footerCallback
[23:51:31] <jqueryius> you have all the answers!
[23:51:31] <jqueryius> :)
[23:52:20] <doug16k> I try
[23:52:56] <rbo> doug16k, i'll be in here a lot more... it's how I learned linux so well ;)
[23:52:56] <doug16k> I never even looked at that plugin until you mentioned it. I guess I've gotten good at reading docs over the years :)
[23:53:37] <jqueryius> what do you surmise "TFOOT element of the table's footer" means?
[23:54:06] <doug16k> tables have 3 sections: THEAD, TBODY, TFOOT
[23:54:08] <jqueryius> can i use that to access the paging elements?
[23:54:38] <doug16k> aren't they in the footer? the example implies that that is where it puts those things
[23:55:07] <jqueryius> looking at the example, I figure I can use $(tfoot) to isolate, for example, tasks-table_paginate
[23:55:11] <jqueryius> sorry #tasks-table_paginate
[23:55:23] <jqueryius> and #tasks-table_info
[23:55:45] <jqueryius> but once I have those ids, how to I swap the divs they are in?
[23:55:54] <jqueryius> so paging is now on the left and  the info summary is on the right
[23:55:59] <doug16k> ah...
[23:56:03] <doug16k> you are using divs?
[23:56:16] <jqueryius> yeah - it comes out like this right now: http://pastebin.com/dVGnDauB
[23:56:30] <jqueryius> I just want to swap the two around
[23:57:42] <dubchasin> wazzup guys
[23:58:13] <dubchasin> is there is someone whoe working with jquery and rails4 stack?
[23:58:28] <doug16k> jqueryius, can't you just switch the order of the li elements?
[23:58:47] <rbo> yay finally got a good working example of using some json
[23:59:29] <doug16k> jqueryius, ah, it's generated isn't it
[23:59:44] <doug16k> but it is a <table> in your html right? (at startup)
[23:59:54] <jqueryius> yeah it's auto generated, only the <table> i put in
