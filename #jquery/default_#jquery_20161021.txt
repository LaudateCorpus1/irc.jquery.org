[04:14:13] <magnetik> Heyo
[04:15:07] <magnetik> I'm loading a plugin with: $.fn.myPlugin = function () { ... }; and directly after calling $('.foo').myPlugin(). But it says that myPlugin is not a function
[04:15:42] <Cork> magnetik: can you reproduce it in a jsfiddle.net?
[04:45:19] <magnetik> Cork, this was a problem with another javascript i'm loading, thanks for taking some time to answer me :)
[05:27:07] <acidjazz> isnt there an easier way than parent().parent()
[05:27:12] <acidjazz> like i thoguht parent(2) did the same thing
[05:28:32] <bjorngi> Hello. I've gotten som compaints about a race-condition in my application. It suppose to do a AJAX-call with an ID gotten from $(e).data('authid), but authid is undefined, and it seems the DOM is to slow to deliver the data before call is sent. As I can see .data is not promise based. Is there a best practice to wait for this value?
[05:38:52] <AdamPDotty> acidjazz: closest('tagyouarelookingfor') might help
[05:45:32] <AdamPDotty> bjorngi: JS works synchronous.
[06:07:01] <bjorngi> AdamPDotty: Wat?
[06:07:53] <bjorngi> AdamPDotty: So anything done on the DOM is synchronous? I have a hard time beliving that.
[06:27:31] <TheDude> is there a way to disable all the page with jquery?
[06:29:06] <TheDude> I have a spinner loader, when I show it I want to prevent every click and scroll  with the page in the background
[06:30:53] <AdamPDotty> like $(document).on('click scroll', function(event){event.stopPropagation(); event.preventDefault();});
[06:31:37] <AdamPDotty> not sure how that interacts with other event handlers though
[06:33:21] <chipyy> Hey,					$("#new-password,#password-confirmation").empty();  is this ok?
[06:33:35] <chipyy> or selector doesnt accept multiple ID-s? because it doesnt work
[06:35:48] <AdamPDotty> not sure, what you are trying to do, but its not wrong in itself
[06:36:06] <sonu_nk> hi can we add file name in Browse button as we did in input value via JS/jQuery ?
[06:36:16] <chipyy> empty input fiels
[06:36:43] <AdamPDotty> so you probably want .val('')
[06:36:59] <AdamPDotty> I do not believe, there is a .clear().
[06:37:36] <AdamPDotty> .empty() manipulates DOM, not the element
[06:37:55] <chipyy> aha, i will try with val('')
[06:37:59] <sonu_nk> As we can set input value name using js/jquey ... is there any trick we can fill input file value ?
[06:39:05] <chipyy> sonu_nk i guess you mean to take a file from database and insert into input with file type?
[06:39:23] <sonu_nk> chipyy, yes same
[06:40:36] <chipyy> with only jquery it wont be possible, because u will still need php to connect to database and get the file
[06:41:00] <chipyy> AdamPDotty, its worked ;)
[06:41:31] <sonu_nk> chipyy, i am using BlueImp image uploader and when i am selecting image using Browse button the progress bar is coming but no any file name is there but text "No file choosen " is there..
[06:41:40] <sonu_nk> with chipyy  jquery is this possible ?
[06:43:16] <chipyy> can i just ask why u dont use <input type="file"> , and about that i cant help you :D i am big rookie at php :D
[06:43:22] <chipyy> and also jquery
[06:49:27] <chipyy> if (charactersOnly.search(/[^a-zA-Z]+/) === -1),, could somebody give me any advice how could i modify this that will also accept other letters not only english?
[06:49:52] <chipyy> ć,š,ž,ß,..... ?
[06:53:27] <chipyy> AdamPDotty^ ? :)
[07:00:33] <AdamPDotty> hmm, you could put them inside the brackets one by one, but theres probably a better solution.
[07:01:12] <AdamPDotty> even when the language is english, the letters stay latin
[07:03:39] <AdamPDotty> maybe that one: [\u00C0-\u017Fa-zA-Z]
[07:03:42] <chipyy> i would rather do without writing one by one :)
[07:03:57] <chipyy> can i askk what that means?
[07:04:16] <AdamPDotty> you probably do not even need the letters then
[07:04:25] <AdamPDotty> There are the unicode numbers
[07:05:02] <AdamPDotty> you could give a range of them, once you know what you need
[07:05:16] <chipyy> now it doesn event recognize any letter :)
[07:05:37] <chipyy> if i enter :asda says that this arent characters :)
[07:06:33] <chipyy> if (name.search(/[\u00C0-\u017Fa-zA-Z]/) === -1)
[07:09:04] <chipyy> AdamPDotty even better would be to check if input contains only letter
[07:09:40] <chipyy> like UTF8 style :)
[07:11:19] <AdamPDotty> should be the same as .search(/[^\u00C0-\u017Fa-z]/)
[07:11:43] <AdamPDotty> ok, depends on what you want
[07:11:58] <AdamPDotty> and put A-Z in
[07:12:07] <AdamPDotty> but looks like a way
[07:14:09] <grek> ji i try start use requirejs - here is my example
[07:14:10] <grek> http://pastebin.pl/view/7d75b99f
[07:15:04] <grek> partial its work but if i create separate script in page - i try use compatibility -if requirejs exist load dependencies -
[07:15:13] <grek> (function( factory ) { ...
[07:15:34] <grek> but this always throw require.min.js:5 Uncaught Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module: function ( ) {
[07:15:39] <chipyy> AdamPDotty it doesnt work, always alerts me that there isnt characters
[07:16:30] <grek> please any suggestion
[07:16:51] <chipyy> AdamPDotty, sory my mistake everything is ok ;)
[07:16:58] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[07:17:17] <AdamPDotty> you could also go like this: charactersOnly .search(/[^A-Za-zÀ-ź]/)
[07:17:51] <AdamPDotty> possibly easier to read.
[07:18:13] <chipyy> whats the difference with previous?
[07:18:40] <AdamPDotty> It does not use the codes, but the letters, should work the same
[07:19:16] <chipyy> codes u mean by this: \u00C0
[07:19:18] <chipyy> ?
[07:19:20] <AdamPDotty> yes
[07:19:28] <AdamPDotty> unicode code
[07:19:29] <chipyy> aha, then i will change it :D
[07:19:55] <chipyy> thank you  very much ;)
[07:21:32] <AdamPDotty> .next
[07:32:28] <grek> i add question to stactoverflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40175616/mismatched-anonymous-define-in-function-factory
[07:33:08] <acidjazz> AdamPDotty: you think thats more efficient?
[07:34:53] <AdamPDotty> just showed you a different approach. Efficiency depends on the problem at hand.
[07:50:28] <acidjazz> so closest goes back? up or down?
[07:50:33] <acidjazz> i guess it crawls both ways?
[07:50:36] <acidjazz> i think parent() is def more efficient
[07:51:15] <slax0r> closest traverses up the tree
[07:51:17] <slax0r> not down
[07:51:26] <acidjazz> i see
[07:51:35] <acidjazz> so parent().parent() is probably the most efficient then
[07:51:36] <slax0r> and it finds only direct parents, not parents siblings
[07:51:46] <acidjazz> i specifically just want to go to the 2nd parent of my element
[07:51:48] <slax0r> depending on what you want
[07:51:56] <slax0r> then .closest
[07:52:00] <slax0r> why parent.parent
[07:52:02] <acidjazz> i am doing a $(el).parent().parent()
[07:52:06] <acidjazz> and its working fine
[07:52:17] <acidjazz> i was just wondering if there was something more efficient
[07:52:22] <acidjazz> or i thought something like .parent(2) would work which it doesnt
[07:53:22] <slax0r> seems like you're starting to micro-optimize
[07:53:41] <slax0r> don't...unless you're doing this couple hundred times in a fraction of a second, it won't make a difference
[07:54:00] <acidjazz> life and death depends on this situation slax0r
[07:54:16] <slax0r> uh-huh
[07:54:24] <acidjazz> yea, no i was just curious if it was old or bad syntax :)
[07:56:18] <slax0r> do it with closest, it's nicer, and probably a bit more efficient, and even if it's not, it's not that much worse to even matter
[07:56:26] <slax0r> and certainly easier on the eyes as .parent.parent
[07:56:42] <acidjazz> so what would i pass closest in this situation
[07:57:35] <slax0r> the selector
[07:57:57] <acidjazz> right so id have to give the 2nd parent a unique selector?
[07:57:59] <slax0r> if the grandparent doesn't have a distinct selector, then stick to .parent.parent
[07:58:07] <acidjazz> and what if my selector was something common?
[07:58:07] <acidjazz> right
[07:58:11] <acidjazz> so saying that
[07:58:15] <acidjazz> do you still think its more efficient?
[07:58:48] <slax0r> I'm saying that the difference in performance is a moot point in this case
[08:00:30] <slax0r> here you can find a couple of comparisons: https://www.sitepoint.com/jquerys-closest-parents/
[08:01:28] <acidjazz> differences add up
[08:01:32] <acidjazz> neat comparison
[08:01:38] <acidjazz> so i guess were both right based on how you use them
[08:01:44] <slax0r> they do, but you have 70k ops per second
[08:02:15] <slax0r> that means you can do .parent.parent ~70 thousand times per one second
[08:02:23] <slax0r> if you have the same hardware
[08:02:26] <acidjazz> or if i have a selector, use closest
[08:02:32] <slax0r> as opposed to 90 thousand times with closest
[08:02:36] <acidjazz> which i dont
[08:02:47] <slax0r> I seriously doubt you will do more than 100 of those per second
[08:02:54] <slax0r> and at that low numbers it really doesn't matter
[08:03:03] <slax0r> because we're talking about >1ms of difference
[08:03:03] <acidjazz> my parent is a div before my grandparent
[08:03:07] <acidjazz> so i really cant use a selector
[08:03:23] <acidjazz> if i had one like your suggestion, i'd win at 91k
[08:03:47] <slax0r> anyhoo
[08:03:48] <slax0r> I'm off
[08:03:49] <slax0r> have fun
[08:04:00] <acidjazz> you too tnx again
[08:22:41] <TheDude> omeone know where is possible to take a circular inderterminate progress indicator (such as android )
[08:22:51] <TheDude> https://material.google.com/components/progress-activity.html#progress-activity-types-of-indicators
[08:23:00] <TheDude> (Circular ---> Indeterminate)
[08:23:49] <MikeD_> "where is possible to take" ?
[08:24:06] <AdamPDotty> internet?
[08:24:20] <MikeD_> isn't that just a spinny .gif ?
[08:29:55] <TheDude> AdamPDotty: maybe I have not found anything?
[08:30:56] <TheDude> MikeD_: I see it as a video (with )

[09:45:56] <sigdk> Hello. I'm using this to write a FAQ: http://www.designonslaught.com/a-simple-jquery-faq-style-show-and-hide/   Any good hint on how to switch between two languages besides c/p the whole page twice? I'd like to click on a flag button and switch languages. I look for a neat solution
[09:47:41] <AdamPDotty> Hmm, you can have both languages in the page, then on click hide one, show the other. Might get inefficient with ten languages.
[09:48:08] <decx> have separate pages and use alternate link elements
[09:48:15] <decx> has nothing to do with jq
[09:48:48] <Cork> ya, ex. http://www.designonslaught.com/en/a-simple-jquery-faq-style-show-and-hide/
[09:49:01] <Cork> that way it can be linked without js too
[09:50:16] <sigdk> decx, yes, but I was wondering how can I implement the toggle with jq. Switch only the content instead of fetching a completely new page
[09:51:07] <sigdk> AdamPDotty, so, throw everything in two divs and hide/show them with js, right?
[09:52:23] <Cork> sigdk: the point is, doing it as fragments would require more work and more network traffic
[09:52:24] <AdamPDotty> If the amount of text is not getting out of hand, yes.
[09:52:56] <Cork> sigdk: what you can do is fetch the new content through ajax and transition it from the old to the new
[09:53:12] <Cork> if you don't want the flicker from the replacement to happen
[09:53:23] <CSGSJay> Hi, my code doesn't seem to toggle :( https://jsfiddle.net/wLz14jfn/
[09:53:31] <sigdk> Cork, i'll try
[09:53:41] <CSGSJay> when i press the button it works, but when i press it again, it doesn't toggle
[09:53:54] <sigdk> Cork, you mean what AdamPDotty also said, right?
[09:54:01] <Cork> no
[09:54:10] <Cork> he talked about sending both languages on every request
[09:54:33] <Cork> i talked about just fetching the new content and then replacing everything straight out
[09:54:45] <Cork> but do it through ajax instead of page load
[09:54:48] <AdamPDotty> Jay: are you positive, heihgt is a function?
[09:54:52] <AdamPDotty> gh
[09:54:52] <Cork> that way you can get a smoother effect
[09:55:25] <sigdk> Cork, but hide/show divs doesn't require page load... (correct ?)
[09:55:28] <CSGSJay> AdamPDotty: it does change the height when i trigger it by clicking the button and there are no errors in console
[09:55:41] <CSGSJay> is there an easier way to change the height of a div by clicking a button?
[09:55:43] <Cork> sigdk: sure, but it means every visitor has to load both pages every time
[09:55:44] <CSGSJay> toggling it*
[09:55:50] <CSGSJay> so it slides down and up animated*
[09:55:56] <Cork> and that is a waste
[09:56:31] <sigdk> Cork, okay, I see...
[10:00:18] <CSGSJay> fixed np adam
[10:02:03] <AdamPDotty> hehe, I completed the fiddle, and it worked for me
[10:11:36] <codecutter> 	why is all properties for strategy null after form submission? http://pastebin.com/2PHYL1pi
[10:14:00] <codecutter> anyone?
[10:23:01] <AdamPDotty> hmm, some Java, declaring a javascript function, no call I do not have to understand this.
[10:35:29] <taplar> codecutter: have you looked at the network response to see what the backend is returning?
[10:35:55] <codecutter> yess
[10:36:11] <codecutter> problems seems to occur after submission
[10:36:15] <codecutter> values are null
[10:36:43] <taplar> so your saying the backend is logging the correct strategy, and the network request is returning the correct strategy?
[10:37:37] <codecutter> not sure what you mean
[10:37:42] <codecutter> when i load the form
[10:37:53] <taplar> you have a System.out.print in your java
[10:37:59] <taplar> does that print out the right thing?
[10:38:07] <codecutter> yes, thats after submission
[10:38:24] <codecutter> attributes of strategy are null on that line
[10:38:34] <taplar> ok.  and you you've looked at the network response and you see that the response body is returning the strategy that you sent, yes?
[10:38:43] <taplar> wait, what?
[10:38:57] <codecutter> let me explain whats going on
[10:39:06] <taplar> System.out.print(strategy); <-- 'attributes of strategy' ?
[10:39:37] <codecutter> the form is submitted to this method strategyPost() (line 2)
[10:40:48] <codecutter> That method casts the form object to 'strategy' class type
[10:41:20] <codecutter> when I log the contents of strategy, it's class properties are all null
[10:41:25] <codecutter> not the actual object
[10:41:27] <taplar> it parses the input into an object of Strategy, right
[10:41:31] <codecutter> make sense?
[10:41:36] <taplar> i know java dude, ya
[10:41:49] <taplar> so the inputs are not there
[10:42:03] <codecutter> oh, we're on #jquery so i assumes otherwise
[10:42:05] <codecutter>  y bad
[10:42:08] <codecutter> my*
[10:42:17] <codecutter> assumed*
[10:42:29] <taplar> in that case take a look at the ajax request in your network tab and make sure the request parameters are as you are expecting them to be
[10:42:44] <codecutter> let me do that now
[10:43:36] <codecutter> xhr?
[10:43:42] <taplar> cause i'm not entirely sure that's your constructing the data right
[10:43:58] <taplar> usually it's something like data: $form.serialize()
[10:44:23] <codecutter> i'm using formData instead
[10:44:28] <taplar> right.  why?
[10:44:39] <codecutter> besuase that gives me a 403 error
[10:45:10] <codecutter>  $form.serialize() <--- this gives 403 error
[10:45:30] <taplar> what is data.form?
[10:45:44] <taplar> is it an Element or a jQuery element?
[10:45:45] <codecutter> thats the actual form
[10:45:50] <codecutter> $('.form')
[10:45:54] <taplar> ok $( data.form ).serialize()
[10:46:11] <codecutter> yes, thats gives me a 403 error
[10:46:16] <taplar> :s
[10:47:11] <taplar> console.log( $ data.form ).serialize() );
[10:47:18] <taplar> console.log( $( data.form ).serialize() );
[10:47:27] <codecutter> that logs the form content
[10:47:33] <taplar> in key value pairs?
[10:47:34] <codecutter> which seems find
[10:47:39] <codecutter> fine*
[10:47:53] <taplar> ok, then that's not the issue then
[10:48:03] <taplar> comment out the dataType line
[10:48:17] <codecutter> 1 sec
[10:48:25] <taplar> i don't see anything with your java code that is translating the object to json
[10:49:40] <codecutter> no luck
[10:49:58] <taplar> is your backend logging anything different?
[10:50:17] <codecutter> no, properties are still null
[10:50:30] <taplar> does the request now have the correct parameters in the network tab?
[10:50:47] <taplar> the request, not the response
[10:51:47] <codecutter> i don;'t see any paramters, maybe i need to select one of the sub tabs
[10:51:57] <codecutter> i have selected xhr
[10:52:33] <codecutter> i don;t see any error codes so it seems fine
[10:53:03] <taplar> open your network tab before you submit the request.  clear it out, then make the page perform the request. you should then see it, as well as probably other requests, in there.  click on it and on the RHS a panel should open.  one of them should be the request headers one which if you click on or something, more options should show where you can c
[10:53:03] <taplar> lick 'params' or something
[10:53:18] <codecutter> beisdes the server would throw cast exception if any params were missing
[10:53:38] <taplar> you said it was printing nulls
[10:54:00] <taplar> right now i'm trying to rule out the request so that we can say it is a backend problem
[10:54:18] <taplar> which is why i'm wanting to confirm that the request params are correct
[10:54:28] <codecutter> okay
[10:55:06] <codecutter> ah!
[10:55:39] <codecutter> preview tab seems to show all property values are null
[10:55:59] <taplar> so it has keys without any values?
[10:56:41] <codecutter> e.g. account: null
[10:56:42] <codecutter> ...
[10:56:43] <codecutter> yes
[10:57:08] <taplar> but console.log( $( data.form ).serialize() ); looked right?
[10:57:22] <codecutter> hang on. let me double check that.
[10:58:44] <codecutter> yes
[10:58:52] <codecutter> log seems fine
[10:59:10] <taplar> and you changed the ajax request to be = data: $( data.form ).serialize()
[10:59:19] <codecutter> no
[10:59:22] <codecutter> 1 sec
[10:59:23] <taplar> lol
[10:59:41] <codecutter> i told you have that does
[10:59:44] <codecutter> 403 error
[10:59:47] <codecutter> let me do it again
[10:59:54] <codecutter> what that does*
[11:00:07] <taplar> make sure the dataType is still commented out ( for now )
[11:01:09] <taplar> cause regardless if it is throwing a 403 or not, we need to get the request sending the expected data
[11:01:18] <codecutter> yes. 403 error
[11:01:21] <taplar> you can't proceed until you get step 1 down
[11:01:26] <codecutter> oh
[11:01:33] <codecutter> did'nt comment out dtatType
[11:01:37] <codecutter> 1 sec
[11:02:04] <codecutter> 403 error
[11:02:16] <taplar> so data: is changed now, dataType is commented out, yes?
[11:02:25] <codecutter> preview tab show a page with "HTTP Status 403 - Invalid CSRF Token 'null' was found on the request parameter '_csrf' or header 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'"
[11:02:39] <taplar> ok, that's different
[11:02:46] <taplar> are you trying to do a request across domains?
[11:03:08] <taplar> or before that
[11:03:15] <codecutter> which is strange becuase _csrf formdata seems to send the _csrf with data
[11:03:17] <codecutter> no
[11:03:17] <taplar> what do the request params look like now in the network tab?
[11:04:10] <codecutter> under request payload i'm saying the data
[11:04:14] <codecutter> seeing*
[11:04:23] <taplar> so that part is correct now
[11:05:00] <codecutter> i didn't check that section beofre
[11:05:03] <codecutter> before*
[11:05:15] <codecutter> so it may have been the same
[11:05:17] <taplar> the payload and the params tab should be the same
[11:05:38] <taplar> params tab will make it like bullets that are expandable and such, a tree like thing
[11:05:56] <taplar> so does it contain a _csrf key?
[11:06:12] <codecutter> what do you mean by params? are you refering to the preview tab?
[11:06:20] <taplar> are you in firefox or chrome?
[11:06:26] <codecutter> chorme
[11:06:29] <codecutter> chrome*
[11:06:30] <taplar> one sec
[11:07:27] <taplar> ok, that may be a firefox thing
[11:07:50] <taplar> the "headers" tab may be where your data will be
[11:08:04] <taplar> ya
[11:08:13] <taplar> it will show them as "Query String Parameters" towards the bottom
[11:08:33] <taplar> or something like that
[11:08:47] <taplar> anyway.  if your see your data that's good.  so do you see a _csrf key in there?
[11:11:51] <codecutter> 403 error has gone
[11:12:04] <codecutter> but values are still null
[11:12:25] <codecutter> _csrf is there
[11:12:27] <taplar> but the request looks right?
[11:12:30] <codecutter> yes
[11:12:38] <taplar> ok, so now!  it's a backend problem, :)
[11:12:40] <codecutter> values are null in preview tho
[11:13:23] <codecutter> but yes, Request Payload seems to have the correct values
[11:13:53] <codecutter> Preview Tab shows the values to be still not e.g. account: null, ...
[11:14:02] <codecutter> null*
[11:14:25] <taplar> right, because the backend isn't returning the right stuff.  so now it would be a question for some #java or ##java peeps
[11:14:30] <taplar> whatever their room is
[11:15:06] <codecutter> let me reboot the server
[11:15:16] <codecutter> with $($form)).serialize()
[11:18:18] <codecutter> brb
[12:01:21] <codecutter> tapler: there?
[12:02:14] <codecutter> nvm
[12:06:08] <taplar> yup
[12:14:09] <codecutter> still getting that error 403 with form.serialize()
[12:15:25] <codecutter> Invalid CSRF token found for http://localhost:8080/setting/strategy
[12:15:30] <codecutter> server log
[12:16:19] <Z3R0> Anyone here use or has used Highcharts? Trying to retrieve information from a MySQL DB just unsure of how to pull and generate all the data I am wanting to show... for a single or multiple office (I can pull data just fine) but when trying to compare something to say "last year" I want it to overlay and having issues trying to get that generated.
[12:28:02] <taplar_lunch> codecutter: but you see the _csrf on the request?
[12:28:50] <codecutter> Request PayLoad: ... &_csrf=29315584-b3b9-47ed-a893-c56c992f92c7
[12:28:52] <codecutter> yes
[12:29:23] <taplar_lunch> hmm, i wonder if your server is expecting it in that header 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'"
[12:30:34] <Ownix> This line of code only works when im in Chrome and debugging `elementsNeedingAdjustment.css('margin-top', '-=' + databaseStatusPreviousOffset);` why is that?
[12:30:55] <taplar_lunch> Ownix: try using 'marginTop'
[12:31:07] <Ownix> taplar_lunch: is that a function?
[12:31:24] <taplar_lunch> dunno if that is the issue, but css() usually takes camel case strings as param1
[12:31:43] <taplar_lunch> it converts them into the actual key on the back
[12:31:54] <Ownix> No dice taplar_lunch
[12:32:04] <Ownix> didnt work. I tried wrapping the call in a setTimeout() too
[12:32:10] <taplar_lunch> can you replicate the issue in a fiddle?
[12:32:26] <Ownix> I highly doubt it but ill try.
[12:35:00] <codecutter> Invalid CSRF Token 'null' was found on the request parameter '_csrf' or header 'X-CSRF-TOKEN'.
[12:35:07] <taplar_lunch> codecutter: another thing i just thought of.  have you tried letting the form submit normally and seen it work?
[12:45:15] <Ownix> Works great in a fiddle, as always
[12:45:34] <codecutter> taplar_lunch: still null
[12:45:42] <taplar_lunch> with a normal form submit?
[12:53:46] <codecutter> yes
[12:54:08] <taplar_lunch> so then something is wrong with how your form is constructed, if it fails with just a normal form submit.
[12:54:19] <taplar_lunch> cause that's outside javascript all together
[12:58:52] <codecutter> got it!
[12:58:58] <codecutter> :)
[12:59:02] <taplar_lunch> oh?
[12:59:15] <codecutter> looking in the wrong place
[12:59:20] <taplar_lunch> nyce
[12:59:28] <codecutter> thanks for the help tho
[12:59:30] <codecutter> good man
[12:59:31] <codecutter> :)
[12:59:37] <taplar_lunch> np, heh.
[12:59:39] <codecutter> or woman :)
[13:00:00] <taplar_lunch> i was suggesting all these things and thinking, "dude, this guy is going to think i'm just trying to push the responsibility away from jquery."
[13:02:44] <codecutter> haha
[13:02:56] <codecutter> i did think that
[13:03:00] <codecutter> to be honest
[13:03:11] <taplar_lunch> ya, wouldn't blame ya
[13:03:13] <codecutter> and you were correct
[13:03:27] <taplar_lunch> but gotta rule out stuff to figure out what the issue is, :)
[13:03:41] <codecutter> i had to do with the object the form was binded to
[13:03:52] <codecutter>  a server side issue
[13:03:56] <codecutter> it*
[13:05:29] <codecutter> <form th:object="${account.strategy}" th:action="@{...}" method="post">
[13:05:29] <codecutter> it should be <form th:object="${strategy}" th:action="@{...}" method="post">
[13:17:15] <codecutter> i'm out
[13:17:18] <codecutter> thanks again
[14:10:32] <acidjazz> wth format was that
[14:21:59] <funkykat> hello
[14:23:02] <funkykat> I have a table with 9 td's. I want to change the color of the text in 3 specific td's - what is the best way to do this?
[14:26:03] <taplar> do they have any identifying ids/classes on them?
[14:26:10] <taplar> which ones do you want to color?
[14:26:22] <jbeeze> funkykat: you can set a specific class on those tds
[14:26:37] <funkykat> no taplar - just td
[14:26:52] <jbeeze> you wouldn't need jquery, just css
[14:27:05] <taplar> hitup #css or ##css for that
[14:27:09] <acidjazz> funkykat: give htem classes
[14:27:37] <funkykat> the specific ones I want to change will vary. My function returns an array with 3 values. If you can imagine a tic tac toe game and I'm trying to highlight the winning combination
[14:28:30] <jbeeze> funkykat: Ah. If they're arrays that match a winning condition, i'd add CSS to them through nth-child
[14:28:53] <funkykat> yeah, I'm unsure how to do that
[14:29:14] <jbeeze> you can grab all the td
[14:29:53] <jbeeze> 's with jQuery with $('td') and loop through them seeing if there's a winning condition
[14:31:49] <funkykat> jbeeze, yeah I've found the winning combination. Let's say it's [6,7,8] (i.e. the bottom row). My td's are in a 1-d array. How do I change the color of those specific td's?
[14:33:02] <funkykat> so if tiles= $(td). Then something like tiles[6] = ????
[14:33:20] <taplar> wouldn't 6 be position 5?
[14:34:05] <funkykat> no, because top left of 3x3 grid is 0. So bottom row winning combination is [6,7,8]
[14:34:16] <taplar> you said you hd them in a 1d array
[14:34:36] <funkykat> they are in 1-d array...[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
[14:34:53] <funkykat> so grid looks like:
[14:34:56] <funkykat> 0 1 2
[14:34:59] <funkykat> 3 4 5
[14:35:01] <funkykat> 6 7 8
[14:35:18] <funkykat> so 0 4 8 is a winning combination too
[14:35:29] <jbeeze> why wouldn't you have it as 2d? eg. [ [0,1,2] , [3,4,5], [6,7,8] ] indicating the top middle and bottom row respecitvely
[14:35:34] <funkykat> just need to select those specific td's and change color
[14:35:34] <jbeeze> much easier to visualize and work that way
[14:35:58] <taplar> "My td's are in a 1-d array" <-- so that's not true
[14:36:09] <taplar> :|
[14:36:39] <funkykat> jbeeze, it makes calculations easier
[14:36:48] <funkykat> taplar, how isn't it a 1-d array?
[14:36:57] <taplar> lol, you said it wasn't
[14:37:05] <funkykat> when?
[14:37:07] <taplar> but you also said it was
[14:37:21] <taplar> "jbeeze, yeah I've found the winning combination. Let's say it's [6,7,8] (i.e. the bottom row). My td's are in a 1-d array. How do I change the color of those specific td's?"
[14:37:26] <funkykat> When did I say it was not a 1-d array??
[14:37:30] <funkykat> lol
[14:37:41] <taplar> no, because top left of 3x3 grid is 0. So bottom row winning combination is [6,7,8]
[14:37:51] <jbeeze> if you have queried all the tds, into an array, just add a class and/or css to it?
[14:38:22] <taplar> if you have an 1d array of all the tds, the top left would be 0, the bottom right would be 8
[14:38:41] <taplar> which would mean the winning number would be the number - 1 for the related position
[14:38:43] <taplar> nO?
[14:41:38] <funkykat> taplar, I think there is a misunderstanding and we're digressing from what I initially asked about. I just want to change color of text in the specific td's
[14:41:48] <taplar> right
[14:41:57] <taplar> and i'm saying if you have an array with all the tds
[14:42:14] <taplar> if you say blocks [7, 8, 9] are the winning squares
[14:42:23] <taplar> that would equate to array positions [6, 7, 8]
[14:42:48] <funkykat> yes..that's correct and that is also what I said.
[14:42:56] <taplar> hokay
[14:43:04] <taplar> so what's the confusion now?
[14:43:06] <funkykat> What about changing color of specific td's????
[14:43:36] <taplar> jQuery has css() that you can use to do it, or add a class to it
[14:43:43] <funkykat> how would i change color of tds 6,7,8
[14:43:58] <funkykat> yes i know css, but i'm unsure how
[14:44:03] <taplar> $allTds.eq(6).addClass('highlighMe')
[14:44:26] <jbeeze> ^. Then add the class 'highlightMe' to your css with the CSS you'd like
[14:44:36] <jbeeze> that way you can removeClass when game is over
[14:44:48] <funkykat> ah that's clever
[14:45:33] <jbeeze> but again, i advise doing anything like looks like a matrix into 2d arrays, make's it a lot easier imo
[14:45:39] <jbeeze> but if you can get it working, more power to you
[14:45:45] <funkykat> is there a way to reference all 3 elements in same line...i.e $allTds.eq(6, 7, 8).addClass('highlighMe')
[14:45:57] <taplar> uh, probably slice
[14:46:01] <taplar> one sec
[14:46:29] <jbeeze> funkykat: i would set aside a variable called "winning_combinations" which is a 2d array of winning combinations. YOu'd loop through checking and then set the values in the winning array
[14:46:32] <taplar> $allTds.slice(6, 8).addClass('highlightMe');
[14:47:09] <jbeeze> something like winning_combinations = [ [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 7] ....] etc
[14:47:11] <funkykat> jbeeze, if you're implementing an AI it's better to work with a 1-d array imo
[14:47:34] <funkykat> a 2-d array just means messy for loops all over the place
[14:48:11] <jbeeze> i disagree, but hey, if you can get it working, end user won't care
[14:48:33] <funkykat> yeah, jbeeze - I got it working
[14:48:59] <funkykat> that's excellent taplar - i'm testing it. give me a sec
[14:49:33] <taplar> just in case they are not sequential though, i'd probably do the three calls though
[14:52:09] <funkykat> it works
[14:52:11] <funkykat> very nice
[14:53:44] <funkykat> final question. When I reset the game how do I reset the "highlightme" class?
[14:53:58] <funkykat> or remove it alltogether
[14:54:08] <taplar> $('.highlightMe').removeClass('highlighMe')
[14:54:14] <funkykat> cool
[14:54:29] <taplar> if i could friggen type
[14:55:29] <taplar> maybe go with a better named class though, ;)
[14:55:31] <funkykat> works awesome
[14:55:49] <funkykat> yeah i chose "winning"
[15:00:42] <funkykat> i just went with the following code in the end. works great
[15:00:45] <funkykat>  for (var i=0; i < 3; i++) $("td").eq(winning[i]).addClass('winning');;
[15:00:45] <funkykat>       $(".winning").css('color', 'yellow');
[15:01:06] <taplar> why are you adding a css color to winning?
[15:01:21] <taplar> just make that a part of a css rule
[15:02:51] <jbeeze> you can put the .winning, in your css file
[15:02:57] <jbeeze> or rather should
[15:03:00] <funkykat> yeah, that's best i agree
[15:03:08] <taplar> ^you should
[15:03:25] <taplar> cause otherwise the class doesn't buy you anything
[15:03:35] <taplar> removing the class will not remove the color doing it that way
[15:03:51] <funkykat> yeah I made the change
[15:04:14] <funkykat> I really need to work on css
[15:37:08] <la-ah> Anyone know what triggers event.which === 3 ?
[15:37:22] <la-ah> Can't find it in any of the charts
[15:39:31] <la-ah> Thought it might be a modifier but can't seem to find that either
[15:53:28] <jbeeze> la-ah: 3 is right click
[15:55:52] <la-ah> Jbeeze. Thank you! How did I miss that
[15:56:49] <jbeeze> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[16:47:35] <toothfairy_> Hmmm, what am I missing?  $('#popup').dialog({modal: true, width: 300}).dialog('open').load(this.href)    Setting width of dialog box does not work for me
[16:48:30] <jbeeze> you need to pass in option toothfairy_
[16:48:46] <jbeeze> $('#popup').dialog("option", "width", 300)
[16:48:48] <jbeeze> something like that
[16:49:07] <taplar> he's doing that in the initialization
[16:49:16] <taplar> i don't see a 'modal' option for initialization though...
[16:49:26] <taplar> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-width
[16:49:42] <taplar> nvm, i'm blind
[16:50:29] <toothfairy_> tnx jbeezewill try this
[16:54:27] <toothfairy_> jbeeze: it works however it seems to crash my "$('#popup').hide()" a little bit. Do you know why?  https://dpaste.de/79n5
[16:55:55] <toothfairy_> (its not hiding any longer before click)
[16:56:20] <taplar> that' doesn't look like a valid constructor for dialog
[16:58:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/08g5ze4k/ works fine
[17:02:24] <toothfairy_> taplar: it does :) thank you
[17:03:30] <taplar> i mean that's pretty much what you already had, minus the load()
