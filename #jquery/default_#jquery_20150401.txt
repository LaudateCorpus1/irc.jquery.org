[00:58:30] <ScottyKnows> Hello guys, So I'm trying to get an element after the DOM loads, I have this code after DOM ready: console.log($('div[title="Title"]')), but seems to return the element only sometimes and the other times it doesn't
[00:59:07] <Cork> ScottyKnows: is the element loaded or generated by javascript?
[01:00:01] <ScottyKnows> The element is appended to a table by an API call
[01:00:22] <ScottyKnows> which is JS ofcourse
[01:01:40] <Cork> ScottyKnows: ok, so .ready won't help you
[01:02:06] <Cork> you need either to run this where you append the element, or have a callback from there
[01:02:43] <ScottyKnows> Oh
[01:02:50] <ScottyKnows> Okay, thanks! I'll look into that
[01:07:01] <ScottyKnows> Cork: Say my API call looks like: someApi.render(params), can i append a callback to it like: someApi.render(params, callbackFunction(){}) ?
[01:07:40] <Cork> ScottyKnows: if it supports that, ya
[01:09:17] <ronakrrb> Hey can some one tell me what is the difference between jquery ajax and javascript xmlhttprequest? I am getting a CORS error with javascript but jquery ajax works absolutely fine
[01:09:35] <Cork> ronakrrb: are you using jsonp?
[01:10:19] <ronakrrb> Cork: No. The code is at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29383684/xmlhttprequest-gives-cors-error-where-as-ajax-works if you wish to check
[01:10:45] <ScottyKnows> Cork: It doesn't seem to support that, is there any other way I can way I can ensure that it runs after the append?
[01:11:04] <ScottyKnows> I've tried to log the return value, but apparently it doesn't return anything, the api call
[01:11:06] <Cork> ScottyKnows: you could try running it directly after that call
[01:11:12] <Cork> ScottyKnows: but that only works if it isn't async
[01:11:26] <Cork> if it is, you would have to modify the .render function
[01:12:38] <ronakrrb> Cork: i am curios to know what is that in jquery which bypasses the CORS
[01:12:47] <ScottyKnows> Thanks Cork!
[01:40:36] <Omar-> which way is better to attach events, bind to document and delegate? or wrap code in a custom event or ready and then bind event directly to elements? http://jsfiddle.net/xov29ds1/
[01:41:16] <Omar-> I know delegation will include dynamically created elements. but isnt expensive to always bind event to document and then delegate?
[01:42:06] <Cork> Omar-: where delegate makes a difference is when you handle multiple elements with a single handler on a parent
[01:42:28] <Cork> Omar-: so specifically it is about when you add event listeners in a loop
[01:42:46] <Cork> if you use a custom event or delegate makes little difference
[01:42:54] <Cork> i would go with delegate in those cases
[01:44:40] <basiclaser> hey guys, whats wrong with this little event listener ? http://jsbin.com/reqebijemu/1/edit?js,console,output
[01:45:12] <Omar-> Cork thanks for your input. so you always recommend delegation? I assume it's not expensive and wouldn't affect performance
[01:45:23] <Cork> basiclaser: jquery uses .on not .addEventListener
[01:45:39] <Omar-> basiclaser $("#customerform")[0].add.....
[01:45:43] <Cork> no
[01:45:51] <Cork> just use .on
[01:45:52] <Omar-> you're dealing with jQ object
[01:46:00] <Omar-> oh, that doesn't work?
[01:46:08] <Cork> it does, but why?
[01:46:16] <Cork> just use the cross browser .on
[01:46:40] <Omar-> true
[01:47:11] <basiclaser> wow thanks
[01:47:21] <basiclaser> I hate getting stuck on small BS like this
[01:48:08] <basiclaser> so I cant use native JS stuff like addEventListener when using the jquery $() selector method thing?
[01:48:22] <Cork> basiclaser: you can, but addEventListener is a dom function
[01:48:28] <Cork> so you have to run it on dom elements
[01:48:41] <Cork> well it is a dom function in some browsers
[01:48:50] <Cork> (older is uses attachEvent)
[01:49:12] <basiclaser> good to know, thanks
[01:50:05] <ScottyKnows> Hey Cork, so apparently grabbing the elements after the api call doesnt seem to work, so i believe its async? Is there somehow i can make it run synchronously?
[01:50:55] <Cork> ScottyKnows: not unless it has an option for it, but making async sync normally have bad responsiveness effect on the page
[01:55:19] <ScottyKnows> Uhm. Thought so. Thanks
[01:55:55] <ronakrrb> Cork: did you get a chance to look at the code?
[02:15:56] <basiclaser> Oh another thing guys. how would I pull the ID of the element being typed in, in this case http://jsbin.com/reqebijemu/1/edit?html,js,console,output ??
[02:16:01] <basiclaser> im almost there,
[02:16:47] <Cork> basiclaser:  $("form").on ("keydown", "input", function (){
[02:19:03] <babykosh> jquery gods i solute you
[02:19:27] <basiclaser> Cork: wow, so is that an available jquery on parameter?
[02:19:43] <Cork> basiclaser: its called delegation
[02:19:49] <Cork> ?api delegate
[02:19:54] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:20:41] <babykosh> question: how do i fire an event only the first time a page reloads and at no other time.?
[02:44:14] <blenny24_> What would be a good JavaScript UI toolkit for a business application? Thx.
[02:48:08] <Cork> blenny24_: for me i would prob use jquery ui; but you might like extjs
[02:48:31] <Cork> it has a designer that business usually like a lot
[02:48:44] <blenny24_> Cork: Do you mean a GUI designer?
[02:48:54] <blenny24_> Ah, that's why it costs 3000 USD.
[02:50:12] <Cork> blenny24_: its only called ext designer
[02:50:19] <Cork> blenny24_: and it is for more then just the ui
[02:50:26] <Cork> its quite close to how access works
[02:50:33] <Cork> (office access)
[02:51:18] <blenny24_> I looks like it's worth the money!
[02:51:21] <blenny24_> Cork, i see. thx.
[02:55:09] <DragonPunch> via jQuery how do I append not at the end of say a list but at the beginning?
[02:55:23] <Cork> ?api prepend
[02:55:23] <b-ot> Cork: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[02:55:29] <DragonPunch> Cork: thank you <3
[03:00:10] <blenny24_> Cork: Is there any alternative to sencha architect? It can cost money :).
[03:00:22] <blenny24_> Cork: i like the idea of RAD tools for the Web.
[03:00:48] <Cork> blenny24_: i'm sure there is, it's the only one i've seen in action though
[03:02:29] <blenny24_> Cork: http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end Maybe that
[03:05:11] <basiclaser> where can i find a list of all possible events for .on?
[03:05:31] <blenny24_> cork, it's always interesting what companies develop internally.
[03:05:48] <Cork> basiclaser: its mainly just normal dom events
[03:05:59] <Cork> basiclaser: api.jquery.com lists the jquery extended ones
[03:06:59] <basiclaser> Cork: thanks, I'm basically looking for an event which incorporates keyup and click
[03:07:08] <Cork> basiclaser: there isn't one
[03:07:15] <basiclaser> can i add two events to jquery .on ?
[03:07:23] <Cork> basiclaser: btw you most likely want input not keyup
[03:07:31] <Cork> basiclaser: yes
[03:07:38] <Cork> but start with trying the input event
[03:07:45] <Cork> it might be exactly what you want
[03:07:46] <basiclaser> input sounds reasonable
[03:07:50] <basiclaser> burb
[03:12:22] <basiclaser> Cork: i expect it will work with some tweaking, atm select-option fields don't seem to respond though
[03:12:23] <basiclaser> http://jsbin.com/reqebijemu/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[03:12:41] <Cork> ya, select should use change
[03:12:51] <Cork> input is for input and textarea
[03:13:15] <Cork> basiclaser: also the "input" selector doesn't catch select elements :)
[03:13:23] <basiclaser> hrmm ok :)
[03:13:25] <Cork> (delegation)
[03:13:43] <Cork> so ("input change", "input, select"
[03:15:29] <basiclaser> Cork: amazing! thanks
[03:23:57] <DragonPunch> how to coutn the number of children of a given parent selector
[03:24:21] <Cork> .children().length?
[03:26:05] <DragonPunch> Cork: i have that...
[03:26:20] <DragonPunch> http://hastebin.com/itezenuqeq.coffee
[03:26:40] <DragonPunch> it is giving me the alert
[03:26:51] <DragonPunch> instead of doing the other statement.
[03:27:25] <Cork> DragonPunch: just use :empty
[03:27:48] <DragonPunch> Cork: for what..?
[03:27:57] <DragonPunch> Cork: i'm getting 0 for children().lenght;
[03:28:05] <Cork> if($(".file-preview-area:empty").length > 0) {}
[03:28:23] <Cork> DragonPunch: so it doesn't have any children
[03:28:55] <DragonPunch> yeah i think im using wrong selector
[03:29:06] <DragonPunch> ops
[03:29:07] <DragonPunch> yah i am
[03:30:10] <DragonPunch> let me retri
[03:44:13] <Aristata> Can anyone explain this to me?
[03:44:17] <Aristata> $('body')
[03:44:17] <Aristata> []
[03:44:17] <Aristata> $('body').hasClass('internal company planner target')
[03:44:17] <Aristata> false
[03:44:17] <Aristata> $('body').hasClass('internal company planner standard target')
[03:44:18] <Aristata> true
[03:44:34] <Aristata> How could the first one be false and the second one be true?
[03:45:52] <Aristata> Oh I think I know.
[03:47:08] <Cork> Aristata: i would recommend using $('body.class1.class2.class3....').length > 0 instead
[03:48:17] <Aristata> Cork:  Ah, excellent suggestion, much better than $('body').hasClass('internal') && $('body').hasClass('company') && $('body').hasClass('planner') && $('body').hasClass('target') )
[03:48:21] <Cork> Aristata: i don't think hasClass actually supports multiple classes
[03:49:05] <sacho> it doesn't
[03:49:27] <Aristata> As I have just found out!
[03:50:09] <Cork> ugg ya
[03:50:21] <Cork> it regex string matches in the ClassName string O_o
[03:50:42] <Cork> (" " + this[i].className + " ").replace(rclass, " ").indexOf( className )
[03:51:23] <sacho> that's just tokenizing classes from the className property
[03:51:45] <Cork> sure, but it makes a string search
[03:52:31] <Cork> i was hoping it at least used .matches with a fallback
[03:53:10] <sacho> .matches?
[03:53:22] <Cork> ?mdn element.matches
[03:53:22] <b-ot> Cork: Element.matches() - Web API Interfaces - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches
[03:55:25] <sacho> that wouldn't make sense.
[03:56:04] <Cork> it would
[03:56:20] <Cork> just replace spaces with a dot and prepend a dot
[03:56:28] <Cork> and you have a selector you can use with .matches
[03:58:54] <sacho> and make sure you escape any selector characters?
[03:59:11] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/56rvwdzq/
[04:07:31] <Kartagis> is it possible to search in a remote XML file with ajax?
[04:07:52] <Cork> only if there was server code to do the searching
[04:07:54] <Kartagis> the XML will be a list of products
[04:08:07] <Kartagis> Cork: there is
[04:08:15] <Cork> else you will have to download the entire thing and do the searching locally
[04:08:16] <Kartagis> (I hope there is)
[04:09:18] <sacho> in that sense, your question is basically "is it possible to send a request with ajax"
[04:09:49] <Kartagis> sacho: a search request, right?
[04:10:17] <sacho> an http request
[04:11:15] <Kartagis> so, I will search on sending an http request with ajax
[04:11:44] <Cork> Katharsis: you should look into what you have server side instead
[04:12:08] <Kartagis> I have PHP
[04:12:08] <Cork> if you have a static xml file you most likely don't have a server side solution to search it
[04:12:36] <Kartagis> I use a CMS, and a module produces the XML file
[04:16:24] <ronakrrb> sacho: I am not able to send xmlhttprequest POST JSON but with jquery ajax, things are working fine. Can you help me with what the issue could be?
[04:17:03] <sacho> why not?
[04:18:40] <ronakrrb> sacho: when i do not specify Content type to x-www-form-urlencoded, it gives 406 Not applicable error and when i specify it, it give CORS error. But with jquery ajax, its working absolutely fine.
[04:18:57] <ronakrrb> sacho: I think i am not writing the correct code
[04:19:32] <ronakrrb> sacho: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29383684/xmlhttprequest-gives-cors-error-where-as-ajax-works
[04:22:30] <sacho> um, the explanation you give here and the one on s/o don't match
[04:24:03] <sacho> ah, I misread.
[04:24:17] <sacho> anyway, the server is probably not properly configured to allow cross-origin requests
[04:28:53] <sacho> if you are looking for the non-tl;dr version, the server probably only handles simple cors requests - http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#cross-origin-request-0
[04:29:30] <ronakrrb> sacho: i agree but how is jquery.ajax able to handle it
[04:30:43] <basiclaser> is my beloved Cork still here
[04:31:08] <Cork> basiclaser: just ask the question if you have one
[04:31:29] <sacho> ronakrrb, it doesn't send a json content type.
[04:32:11] <sacho> you should just check the two requests with your browser's developer tools, and see their difference.
[04:34:09] <basiclaser> Cork: thanks. How would I take any input value and assign it as a key value in a specified object? the id of the input being the key?
[04:34:36] <basiclaser> i tried something like object.(this.id) = this.value; but couldnt use dot notation like that
[04:34:43] <sacho> object[this.id]
[04:34:45] <Cork> basiclaser: what are you trying to do?
[04:34:56] <Cork> or rather why are you trying to do this
[04:35:00] <basiclaser> save a form as an object
[04:35:08] <basiclaser> send to server
[04:35:15] <Cork> ?api serialize
[04:35:15] <b-ot> Cork: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[04:35:19] <Cork> you don't have to :)
[04:35:32] <Cork> also see ?api serializeArray
[04:35:34] <basiclaser> know weigh broah
[04:35:42] <Cork> ?api serializeArray
[04:35:43] <b-ot> Cork: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[04:35:54] <basiclaser> wicked!
[04:36:24] <basiclaser> so i could do something like on keyup, serialize the whole form again.
[04:37:26] <Cork> if you need it on every key yes
[04:37:39] <Cork> or just a selective set of elements
[04:37:45] <basiclaser> well ill be using it real-time in the same page, not just as a final submit
[04:37:50] <basiclaser> thanks again Cork !
[04:39:34] <xanderz> hey
[04:40:29] <hanshenrik> is there any jquery selector escape function?
[04:40:57] <arthurvr> you mean to escape special characters in selectors?
[04:41:03] <hanshenrik> yep
[04:41:06] <arthurvr> yes
[04:41:11] <arthurvr> lemme find it
[04:41:28] <arthurvr> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[04:41:35] <arthurvr> Check the `jq` function :)
[04:41:55] <arthurvr> Is that what you wanted? It’s for id’s but the regex is useful.
[04:41:55] <hanshenrik> should be part of jQuery imo :-) thanks
[04:42:06] <hanshenrik> yes that's what i wanted
[04:42:32] <arthurvr> Shouldn’t be. Pretty rare use case + complicates things for many people.
[04:42:33] <hanshenrik> i have a bunch of <li acc="I()¤/("#¤(#RYU(UE!">
[04:42:40] <arthurvr> lol with that
[04:42:47] <hanshenrik> (i don't, but nothing's stopping anybody from making that the acc attribute)
[04:43:15] <hanshenrik> and ill need to do a selector where acc=foo
[04:43:19] <hanshenrik> so foo should be escaped.
[04:43:28] <arthurvr> yup :)
[04:44:14] <hanshenrik> btw should i refrain from using custom attributes on html elements? and if i do invent custom ones, should i name them x_attr or x-attr or something like that?
[04:44:32] <arthurvr> why not data-*?
[04:44:57] <arthurvr> has more features, build in support for many stuff and does not break any semantics.
[04:45:37] <hanshenrik> data-* what?
[04:45:57] <hanshenrik> just call it like data-acc
[04:46:03] <arthurvr> yup
[04:46:03] <arthurvr> http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/
[04:46:05] <arthurvr> `api data
[04:46:05] <b-ot> arthurvr: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[04:46:22] <hanshenrik> thanks
[04:46:30] <arthurvr> That’s what’s meant to do this kind of things huh
[04:46:43] <andezzz> arthurvr: can I ask a question as well?
[04:46:52] <arthurvr> !ask @ andezzz
[04:46:52] <b-ot> andezzz: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:47:58] <andezzz> What was all the recent troubles around :visible and .show and .hide about? Is it really that bad for perf?
[04:48:16] <arthurvr> It’s all relative :)
[04:48:32] <arthurvr> But if you don’t need them, opt to not use them IMHO.
[04:48:58] <arthurvr> You should just not use things like :visible super heavy.
[04:49:46] <andezzz> Okay. Could not find more then some tweets on it so thanks
[04:49:55] <arthurvr> andezzz: It was right in the api docs.
[04:49:58] <arthurvr> `api visible
[04:49:58] <b-ot> arthurvr: No matches.
[04:50:07] <arthurvr> freakin’ b-ot
[04:50:08] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[04:50:42] <andezzz> thanks
[04:50:44] <ronakrrb> sacho: thanks
[04:51:36] <arthurvr> Oh btw the :visible thing will improve in 3.0
[04:52:01] <hanshenrik> jquery 3x?
[04:52:27] <arthurvr> yeah 3.0 compat. To be released soon, hopefully
[04:53:52] <hanshenrik> any way to instruct the browser that "if the user tried selecting *ANY* character in this span (or whatever), he meant to select all the characters in the span"
[04:54:13] <hanshenrik> pretty sure i saw photobucket do it, but they used a fugly Flash hack
[04:54:29] <hanshenrik> imageshack*
[04:54:43] <arthurvr> That sounds like quite a terrible idea for mobile
[04:54:52] <arthurvr> depending on how you implement that, of course.
[04:55:07] <arthurvr> plus accessibility too I guess
[04:55:12] <hanshenrik> its part of an IP address, i can't imagine any scenario where they'd just want to copy a part of an ip address
[04:55:46] <hanshenrik> well its not important
[04:59:10] <andezzz> hanshenrik:I think that would mean many repaints (and I think arthurvr was complaining about that perf wise)
[04:59:34] <wefwe> jquery material desgin?
[04:59:39] <andezzz> plus tricky behaviour like this means bad accessibility troubles
[04:59:41] <wefwe> or flat design?
[04:59:56] <arthurvr> wefwe: What do you mean?
[05:00:05] <arthurvr> Are you searching for a plugin or so?
[05:00:13] <wefwe> ı want to use a different UI for jquery mobile not default?
[05:00:19] <wefwe> how can success it?
[05:00:44] <wefwe> yep can be plugin or template or any tools easily design it
[05:01:08] <wefwe> and it must be seem so native and a professional apperance
[05:01:16] <arthurvr> Didn’t see any themes for it but would love to see it
[05:02:10] <andezzz> why don't you just use polymer or wsk?
[05:02:48] <andezzz> Oh not all features and browser compat gotcha
[05:02:51] <andezzz> ya
[05:03:09] <wefwe> ı ll publish it for android
[05:03:15] <wefwe> ios and windows
[05:03:22] <wefwe> so try to unify the screen
[05:03:36] <wefwe> and default design is like a website
[05:03:51] <arthurvr> yeah
[05:04:05] <arthurvr> If one ends up porting things like that over to ui themes I’d love to see it
[05:04:13] <arthurvr> Though I don’t think it happened yet
[05:05:35] <wefwe> polymer is suitable all features of jquery?
[05:05:45] <wefwe> swipe, tab, toast etc
[05:05:53] <arthurvr> no
[05:07:03] <Mement> What is the best way to check how many 'field-keyword-options' classes there are and change there corresponding <a id=..> ? http://pastie.org/private/y6n912yldjlfikh7wfbbq
[05:08:58] <arthurvr> You mean to check how many elements there are on your page with the same class?
[05:09:31] <arthurvr> And then add that to an id? That’s not that difficult. Is that what you’d like to do?
[05:11:07] <Mement> Well, I already do that, but the small snippet I pasted above this message shows a portion inside that one. The onclick="deleteKeywordItem" needs to be renamed by how many class="keyword-box" there are.
[05:11:43] <arthurvr> That seems like a pretty bad idea, honestly.
[05:11:54] <arthurvr> Although can you create a fiddle?
[05:12:10] <Mement> http://pastie.org/private/dgapof6dcmodpdtxsk1g
[05:12:21] <Mement> Oh, I can do that aswell
[05:12:26] <arthurvr> that’s not a fiddle :)
[05:12:28] <arthurvr> `paste
[05:12:28] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:12:42] <Mement> Ye, sorry, already pasted before saw your message. Gimme a sec :)
[05:12:57] <arthurvr> k :) Thanks Mement
[05:24:11] <Mement> http://jsfiddle.net/efpp7pL8/ -- This is basically the idea. But when the user removes an input, the deleteTag needs to be renamed aswell accoring to how many boxes there are.
[05:25:02] <Mement> arthurvr: ^
[05:25:55] <arthurvr> k will take a look.
[05:26:53] <arthurvr> Is that actually important to have the number there? Seems like pretty bad idea plus buncha code complication.
[05:27:37] <arthurvr> If it’s just there to be able to swap out the tag there are better solutions for that.
[05:28:29] <Mement> You mena the number in the deleteTag function? It's needed to delete the corresponding input field.
[05:28:54] <arthurvr> Can I try to show you off a better solution for that? Seems like pretty bad idea?
[05:29:17] <Mement> Sure you can, always up to improve myself :)
[05:30:46] <Xatenev> Heya
[05:30:50] <Xatenev> fast question
[05:30:57] <Xatenev> jquery selector :hidden targets all hidden elements
[05:31:03] <arthurvr> yes.
[05:31:06] <Xatenev> is my element hidden when a parent element is hidden?
[05:31:19] <Xatenev> so for example <div style="display:none"><span></span></div>
[05:31:23] <Xatenev> is my span considered as "hidden" ?
[05:31:31] <Xatenev> or only the div cause it has style: display: none
[05:32:02] <arthurvr> Xatenev: yes http://jsbin.com/vomofuketo/1/edit?html,js,output
[05:32:27] <Xatenev> oh great
[05:32:40] <Xatenev> could have tried it out myself too lol, didnt know u can just write .is:: ...
[05:32:40] <Xatenev> ^^
[05:32:42] <Xatenev> thanks mate :)
[05:32:44] <arthurvr> Xatenev: you should really not use these selectors heavily.
[05:32:58] <arthurvr> will explain if you like but working on something else atm
[05:33:08] <Xatenev> sure u can :)
[05:33:11] <Xatenev> always wanna learn stuff :P

[05:35:11] <Cork> oh, google >_>
[05:35:46] <arthurvr> Mement: I might have totally misunderstood your question, but
[05:35:53] <arthurvr> Mement: does this do what you like? http://jsfiddle.net/ax2vpgwo/2/
[05:36:28] <arthurvr> Mement: w/o any tricky markup nor code complexity :à
[05:36:30] <arthurvr> :)
[05:37:15] <Mement> That looks exactly what I need, so I don't need to work with all those number of fields when deleting one of them?
[05:37:38] <arthurvr> Mement: totally not. The example works without any of that
[05:37:58] <arthurvr> Mement: Be sure to understand the code, and think twice before doing tricky stuff like this again lol
[05:38:15] <arthurvr> Mement: If you have any questions about the code feel free to ask :)
[05:38:29] <Mement> arthurvr: How does the 'x' know that it belongs to the correct input field?
[05:38:37] <arthurvr> updated version fyi http://jsfiddle.net/ax2vpgwo/3/
[05:39:10] <arthurvr> Mement: Because we attach the handler to it before the we add it to the DOM.
[05:40:25] <Mement> arthurvr: Alrighty, let me have a good look and start reworking my own project a bit. :)
[05:40:28] <Mement> Cheers!
[05:40:46] <arthurvr> Mement: Hope I helped you and if you have any more questions, you’re welcome :)
[05:41:29] <nikhil_> i am getting a response like: {"cart": 9, "object_id": 1, "unit_price": "90.00", "content_type": 22, "id": 43, "quantity": "9.000"}  from an ajax request. i am trying to access response['quantity'], but is returning undefined
[05:41:54] <Cork> nikhil_: make sure you're not working with a string
[05:42:23] <arthurvr> nikhil_: Can you do a fiddle or at least a quick paste of how you’re code looks like? Indeed, be sure to parse the json :)
[05:42:24] <Cork> nikhil_: if you do you need to fix the content-type the server returns
[05:42:34] <nikhil_> im not parsing the json at all
[05:42:42] <nikhil_> server is returning application/json
[05:42:49] <Cork> ok then it should work
[05:43:10] <Cork> nikhil_: what do Object.keys(jsonVariable) give you?
[05:44:59] <nikhil_> Cork, Uncaught TypeError: Object.keys called on non-object
[05:45:13] <Cork> try typeof then
[05:45:19] <nikhil_> but console.log(response) gives me this: {"cart": 9, "object_id": 1, "unit_price": "90.00", "content_type": 22, "id": 43, "quantity": "9.000"}
[05:45:49] <nikhil_> string :/
[05:45:57] <nikhil_> let me check the server
[05:47:46] <nikhil_> Cork, does this mean that the server is not returning json?
[05:47:53] <Cork> nikhil_: yes
[05:48:07] <Cork> or rather it isn't setting the correct content-type header
[05:48:29] <Cork> nikhil_: unless you are doing something wonky with the ajax call that is
[05:49:43] <nikhil_> Cork, arthurvr: https://dpaste.de/Nu9w
[05:50:10] <nikhil_> how can i examine the header of the response coming from an ajax call
[05:50:21] <Cork> nikhil_: use the browsers network tab
[05:51:00] <Cork> nikhil_: btw  contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", <-- this is for the submission TO the server
[05:51:19] <Cork> so unless you do something similar server side you aren't setting the header
[05:51:49] <nikhil_> Cork, this is the response: HTTP/1.0 200 OK
[05:51:50] <nikhil_> Date: Wed, 01 Apr 2015 12:11:04 GMT
[05:51:50] <nikhil_> Server: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.3
[05:51:50] <nikhil_> Vary: Cookie
[05:51:50] <nikhil_> X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
[05:51:50] <nikhil_> Content-Type: application/json
[05:52:14] <Cork> nikhil_: check the content
[05:52:24] <Cork> you might have it double escaped or something like that
[05:53:12] <nikhil_> Cork, how do i "check the content"? the browser network tab?
[05:53:16] <Cork> yes
[05:53:35] <Cork> you should have response/json/similar in there
[05:53:59] <nikhil_> Cork, this is my response: "{\"cart\": 9, \"object_id\": 1, \"unit_price\": \"90.00\", \"content_type\": 22, \"id\": 43, \"quantity\": \"12.000\"}"
[05:54:00] <nikhil_> it's a string
[05:54:12] <Cork> ya, so it is double escaped
[05:54:28] <nikhil_> meaning...
[05:54:34] <nikhil_> should this be a string at all?
[05:54:41] <nikhil_> i dont see why the outer quotes are needed
[05:54:48] <Cork> it should have been {"":""} not "{\"\":\"\"}"
[05:55:16] <Cork> you most likely json escape the content twice server side
[05:55:26] <nikhil_> Cork, thanks, it must be due to my server side serialising
[05:55:35] <Cork> yes, most likely
[05:55:50] <nikhil_> this is the first time i'm ever doing ajax requests
[05:55:52] <nikhil_> thanks for your hel
[05:55:54] <nikhil_> *help
[05:56:02] <nikhil_> I'm getting goosebumps just thinking of the possibilities
[05:56:05] <nikhil_> :D
[05:56:06] <Mement> arthurvr: Yes, I got it working. (Was a small work-around since the form is made up using Symfony2, but it worked!)
[05:56:22] <arthurvr> Mement: Awesome.
[05:56:28] <Cork> nikhil_: there is much cooler things out there, but ya it is a start :)

[05:56:53] <runtyrobot> Hiall! Does anyone have an idea if it's possible to get the pixel width on a margin, that has been defined with a percentage?
[05:57:12] <Cork> runtyrobot: yes, kinda
[05:57:31] <Cork> use outerWidth(true) and subtract outerWidth() from that
[05:57:39] <runtyrobot> ah - yes
[05:57:41] <runtyrobot> thank you
[05:57:42] <Cork> device that by two and you have the margin
[05:57:46] <c0d3n4m3> Is it not possible to just use .width() on the element?
[05:57:54] <Cork> (as long as they are even divided)
[05:58:00] <c0d3n4m3> And that would give you back a number which would be the pixel width?
[05:58:09] <Cork> c0d3n4m3: margin isn't part of the elements width
[05:58:20] <c0d3n4m3> Oh! I didn't see the margin bit in the question lol
[05:58:22] <c0d3n4m3> My bad
[05:58:23] <c0d3n4m3> :D

[06:02:29] <Jupppp> Good afternoon
[06:04:23] <Jupppp> is there anyone who can help with a technical issue?
[06:04:25] <arthurvr> Jupppp: hey hey!
[06:04:28] <arthurvr> sup?
[06:04:33] <Jupppp> hi arthur
[06:05:20] <nikhil_> Cork, so on the server I'm returning a response of the form '{"cart": 9, "object_id": 1, "unit_price": "90.00", "content_type": 22, "id": 43, "quantity": "12.000"}' --- what should this be? If I remove the outer quotes, it's a native python dictionary and i can't return that in a response
[06:05:42] <Jupppp> I'm having a problem with unobtrusive validation on a screen with aprox 2000 checkboxes
[06:05:54] <Cork> nikhil_: you should ask that in #python or a channel for the framework you're using
[06:06:09] <nikhil_> Cork, thnks
[06:06:29] <arthurvr> Jupppp: What problem? Fiddle would be awesome, of course.
[06:07:11] <Jupppp> Well, I've got a dialog (jquery ui) in which I dynamically load 2000+ checkboxes.
[06:07:32] <arthurvr> In what way are you loading them in?
[06:07:51] <Jupppp> by using AJAX
[06:08:14] <arthurvr> fiddle maybe?
[06:08:19] <Jupppp> so we load a full HTML -block and append it to the dialog-content
[06:08:46] <Jupppp> I can try to create a fiddle arthur, just give me a little bit of time to create
[06:09:07] <arthurvr> sure. I gotta leave at the moment but 750 other people are around lol
[06:09:12] <chargen> Hi. I'm making an ajax call and I set one url but then when it executed it points to another url, why?
[06:09:43] <Jupppp> thanks for your help for now arthur
[06:10:07] <Jupppp> I'll try and find someone when i'm done... must work with the other 750 arround ;-)
[06:13:14] <jim87> hello! I'm using jQuery UI's draggable module via jsPlumb (a chars library). I'm facing a problem, i.e. I can't interact with input elements inside of the draggable ones. The "click" event on the input works though, as I can intercept it and force the input's focus method. Is there a better way, i.e. a way to correctly propagate the event, which seems to be intercepted by jQuery UI's draggable module? Unfortunately I can't share the code as it's part o
[06:13:15] <jim87> f a big script and it's hard to reproduce singularly. I hope you understand this and my porblem in any case. Thanks :)
[06:23:25] <franz> what's the benefit of doing: $(function(){$('selector')}) instead of doing directly: $('selector') ?
[06:23:41] <franz> or is it just the same, wrapped in a function?
[06:23:46] <Cork> franz: $(func) is a short for $(document).ready(func)
[06:23:55] <Cork> ?api ready
[06:23:55] <b-ot> Cork: .ready(): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[06:24:12] <franz> ah, thanks!
[06:36:18] <Sal> hi, i'm loading html divs via ajax and i need to execute some js after the loade. Should i execute a function on ajax load success or is it better to just include a script tag inside the html piece?
[06:37:12] <Cork> Sal: it is better to do it in success if it works for what you need to do
[06:37:33] <Sal> ok, one more thing please....
[06:37:49] <Sal> i have some code like this:
[06:38:03] <Sal> (function (window, document, undefined) { .... }) (window, document);
[06:38:26] <Sal> how can i convert that in a function to be called when needed?
[06:38:43] <Cork> Sal: that function is used to scope variables
[06:38:59] <Sal> means?
[06:39:01] <Cork> its better to create a separate function for what you need to execute again
[06:39:15] <Cork> ex. window.funcName = function() {  };
[06:39:22] <Cork> (inside the scope)
[06:39:26] <Sal> oh
[06:39:36] <Sal> so, i could call that var?
[06:39:46] <Sal> insetad of creating a function?
[06:40:03] <Cork> window.funcName  = function() {}; is basically the same as doing function funcName in the global scope
[06:40:12] <Cork> * window.funcName  = function() {}; is basically the same as doing function funcName() {} in the global scope
[06:40:25] <Cork> after you've defined that you can just call funcName()
[06:40:27] <Omar-> does "load" event work on div with background-image: url? or only <img>?
[06:40:35] <Cork> Omar-: no
[06:40:42] <Sal> wait, but i don't have all that
[06:40:56] <Cork> .load works for elements where the content is loaded, so video, script, audio, iframe, and so on
[06:40:56] <Omar-> thanks Cork.
[06:41:05] <Omar-> so only tags
[06:41:06] <Sal> i just have  (function (window, document, undefined) { .... }) (window, document);
[06:41:07] <Omar-> no CSS
[06:41:19] <Cork> yes, and only elements that has a src attribute
[06:41:19] <Sal> if that save the function inside a var, in what var?
[06:42:47] <Cork> Sal: http://jsfiddle.net/drh4ofhu/
[06:43:04] <Sal> the first window, document , undefined are function parameters.. ok, but what are the last ones for?
[06:43:28] <Cork> (function() {})() is a self executing function
[06:43:46] <Cork> the () at the end is where the arguments to the function call is set
[06:43:51] <decx> (function(a,b){ return a+b})(1,2) -> 3
[06:44:00] <Cork> and function() at the top is what name they have
[06:44:10] <Sal> oh, same as calling in it the ready event?
[06:44:20] <Cork> no
[06:44:45] <Cork> Sal: (function (window, document, undefined) { })(window, document);
[06:44:54] <Cork> specifically is for script minification
[06:45:07] <Cork> it defines window document and undefined locally in that function
[06:45:08] <Sal> oh
[06:45:19] <Cork> so the minification script can shorten them
[06:46:41] <Sal> so, the last two window, document, are the parameters passed to the function?
[06:46:46] <Cork> yes
[06:47:03] <Cork> the arguments, but ya
[06:47:03] <Sal> and the first three, are instead the parameters the function accepts?
[06:47:16] <Jupppp> arthur still here?
[06:47:17] <Cork> it is the name those values have inside the function
[06:47:31] <Sal> but it accepts 3 and gets 2
[06:47:33] <Sal> why?
[06:47:35] <Cork> lets do it like this
[06:48:07] <Cork> (function(window, document, undefined) { })(window, document) === function temp(window, document, undefined) { } temp(window, document)
[06:48:29] <Cork> Sal: cause if an argument defined in the function declaration doesn't get a value it is?
[06:48:32] <Cork> undefined
[06:48:53] <Cork> and as minification is about saving bytes
[06:49:02] <Cork> they don't enter undefined when it isn't needed
[06:49:41] <Sal> Cork: http://pastebin.com/KrbQa9RD
[06:50:12] <Sal> the the func, can it be coverted so that i can call it only when needed and also inside the first ready event?
[06:50:47] <Cork> Sal: put the ready event inside the scope?
[06:50:48] <pingo> Is there a more elegant way of writing $('.vertical-slider-container > .slider-vertical').parent() ?
[06:50:59] <Cork> pingo: no
[06:51:10] <pingo> wow that was quick, thanks then :)
[06:51:13] <Cork> css doesn't do parent selection
[06:51:30] <pingo> I see
[06:51:34] <decx> wait wouldnt .vertica-slider-container be the parent?
[06:51:39] <Cork> it has been asked for many times, but would cost way to much for the browser to implement
[06:51:40] <pingo> yes
[06:51:59] <Cork> decx: he wants the parent that has that class inside
[06:52:25] <decx> oh like has
[06:52:31] <Cork> it's been asked for multiple times in the csswg mailing lists :)
[06:52:42] <Cork> its one of the most asked for features actually
[06:52:54] <pingo> Interesting
[06:52:54] <Cork> but it would kill css performance to implement so...
[06:53:14] <Cork> (as browsers would have to double the work they do for every element in the page to support it)
[06:53:53] <Cork> pingo: normally try to move the controlling information to the parent
[06:54:00] <Cork> and control things from there in stead
[06:54:16] <Cork> it is almost always doable, and solves this problem without performance problems
[06:54:30] <chargen> I'm making an ajax call and I get some folder in the url as undefined when executed. Also it isn't pointing to the right url. Can you help me?
[06:54:49] <Cork> ?ask @ chargen
[06:54:49] <b-ot> chargen: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:56:05] <chargen> I'm using this ajax call: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bf7fdc4a27db955138d7
[06:56:22] <chargen> which is inside a callback function.
[06:56:32] <Cork> chargen: never ever do this async: false,
[06:56:43] <Cork> it results in horrible user experience
[06:56:57] <chargen> But I need to wait for the reply
[06:57:05] <Cork> then use callbacks
[06:57:15] <Cork> don't freeze there browser for unknown amount of time
[06:57:40] <fhop> Cork: $.ajax request within the callback of an $.post request possible?
[06:57:42] <chargen> it doesn't look so bad when running it but I'll change it
[06:57:43] <Cork> well it is known; normally < 5 minutes
[06:57:55] <Cork> chargen: cause you most likely sit right next to the server
[06:57:58] <Cork> on a good connection
[06:58:22] <marcus1060> Hi there. Any idea why: $('#app').on('click', $('a'), { test: 'test' }, function() {}); Would give the error: "Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object Object]"
[06:58:23] <Cork> fhop: not sure what the question is
[06:58:45] <Cork> marcus1060: the delecation argument should be a string not a jquery object
[06:58:55] <Cork>  $('a'), <-- should be 'a',
[06:59:12] <marcus1060> Duh... haha. Thanks.
[06:59:14] <Cork> s/delecation/delegation/
[06:59:20] <chargen> I'll add the callback, but I have another problem first. When I enter the url in the ajax call I use "url: "../scripts/getuserstats.php""
[06:59:36] <fhop> Cork: Can I use the data from an ajax success callback as the data im sending in another ajax request?
[06:59:36] <chargen> but it point to another location with an undefined
[06:59:57] <Cork> chargen: normally don't want to use relative urls
[07:00:13] <Cork> chargen: as they are relative to the webpage not the script file
[07:00:31] <chargen> Cork: it fails also with the absolute path
[07:00:43] <Cork> fhop: sure, you have to do it in the success/done callback though
[07:00:56] <Cork> chargen: that is a server problem then
[07:01:04] <chargen> I've used almost the same call in the same script and it didn't fail
[07:01:16] <Cork> chargen: that is just a string to jquery and mainly to the browser
[07:01:27] <Cork> it is up to the server to define what the string means
[07:02:08] <chargen> I get something like this http://mysite.dev/myproject/modules/undefined 404 (Not Found)
[07:02:10] <fhop> Cork: perfect thanks!!, and how would that look server side? (using express),?
[07:02:25] <Cork> fhop: it would look like two normal calls
[07:02:31] <Cork> one after each other
[07:02:39] <Cork> *the other
[07:02:55] <chargen> should be : http://mysite.dev/myproject/scripts/getuserstats.php 404 (Not Found)
[07:03:30] <chargen> the other call in my code works
[07:03:31] <Cork> ?code @ chargen
[07:03:31] <b-ot> chargen: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:03:45] <Cork> oh right you already posted it
[07:04:02] <chargen> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d3057c89c7d5a2edefb7
[07:04:04] <fhop> Cork: okay, not nested, and could I just do example: " app.post('/', etc " for both?
[07:04:46] <Cork> fhop: not sure what app.post is
[07:05:16] <chargen> parent.parent.mailru.common.users.getInfo(function(uData) is a call to an api
[07:05:30] <Cork> chargen: you would have to look at what the server does
[07:05:38] <Cork> cause $.ajax isn't causing this
[07:05:48] <fhop> Cork: alright, can you give a super quick example of what the calls would look like, it would really help me a lot...
[07:06:00] <Cork> chargen: btw another thing data: "q=" + auid, => data: { q: auid },
[07:06:04] <Cork> safer and easier to read
[07:06:11] <chargen> ok
[07:06:21] <Cork> fhop: would look like?
[07:06:26] <Cork> in js you mean?
[07:06:39] <fhop> Cork: sorry, yeah in node.js
[07:06:58] <Cork> in node it would just look like two completely separate http calls
[07:07:27] <Cork> fhop: also for node questions => #node.js
[07:07:29] <chargen> I'll check the server. Thanks Cork.
[07:07:30] <Cork> :)
[07:09:11] <fhop> Cork: okay, because im new to ajax, this is kind of an ajax/node question. are you familiar with express? I dont want to waste your time so ill just ask: how do I receive data on the server sent from a client script which used $.ajax
[07:09:50] <Cork> fhop: server side normally don't see any difference between a straight page load and an ajax call
[07:12:26] <fhop> Cork: well I mean in regarding to communicating data between the two. Right now I have $.post() jquery method client side and a corresponding app.post() express function server side, but when I nesting requests in callbacks, things stop working: http://pastebin.com/V81kmv5P
[07:13:07] <Cork> fhop: you can't really nest
[07:13:34] <Cork> fhop: what happens when you nest them in jquery is just that the second call doesn't happen until the first one completes
[07:13:50] <Cork> what you see server side isn't nested
[07:13:58] <Cork> just two separate calls
[07:14:44] <BillCriswell> fhop: You're not $.post()ing anywhere that I can see?
[07:14:59] <fhop> Cork: Im find with second call not happening until first one completes because of relying on the data from the first callback to form the second call, I couldnt figure out how to nest them serverside without errors
[07:15:14] <BillCriswell> I just see $.post(function(){ }); instead of $.post('url', function() {});
[07:15:23] <Cork> fhop: that would have to be a #node.js question
[07:15:32] <Cork> fhop: but i suspect the answer is "you can't"
[07:15:38] <fhop> Cork okay
[07:15:50] <fhop> BillCriswell: oh, right
[07:16:27] <fhop> okay I think i know what im doing wrong actually
[07:16:28] <fhop> thanks
[07:17:37] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:25:33] <chargen> Cork: related to the problem with the ajax call, the console says it is call from undefined:1 script.
[07:26:14] <chargen> Might it not be a server problema after all?
[07:28:08] <PCatinean> How does one take a event like on('mouseup touchend') and add a 1 seccond delay to it, it another action like this is hit once more it should ignore the first and so on
[07:28:26] <PCatinean> and after the 1 sec delay is gone it should proccess the event
[07:29:01] <user_corrupt> If you click "yes" or "no" on the following page: https://www.intellipolls.com/wp-content/themes/theme/app/standard-poll/ then the following script is triggered: http://pastie.org/10067371 the script gets a bunch of values from a JSON output, assigns them to variables, and does a jQuery.post to a PHP script which submits them to a database.. the script works on Chrome and Firefox (OS X) but fails on Safari (without showing any errors in the console).
[07:30:27] <user_corrupt> the script will also fail for you guys since you haven't granted Facebook permissions, but that's normal
[07:38:55] <chargen> Cork: I've tried the url directly in the browser and all looks ok there
[07:46:56] <Elirips> Hello. Is it possible to change the language of a Datetimepicker while everything is running? I can set it initially using, '$.timepicker.setDefaults($.timepicker.regional[lang]);' but I'm unable to change it while the page is loaded. Any hintgs?
[07:47:15] <Elirips> .. where lang is something like 'de', 'fr', etc.
[07:52:07] <BillCriswell> Elirips: You can maybe destroy then reinit.
[07:52:32] <BillCriswell> Actually let me look at the docs first.
[07:53:00] <Elirips> BillCriswell: For the DatePicker it works by simply calling '$.datepicker.setDefaults($.datepicker.regional["de"]);' at a later point in time
[07:53:26] <Elirips> but if I call '$.timepicker.setDefaults($.timepicker.regional["de"]);' it does not change at all - also i get no error
[07:54:35] <BillCriswell> Elirips: You might need to do like $('.some-input').datepicker('destroy'); $.datepicker.setDefaults($.datepicker.regional["de"]); $('.some-input').datepicker();
[07:54:42] <BillCriswell> but I can take a closer look real quick.
[07:56:04] <BillCriswell> Elirips: Seems like you can just do $('.some-input').datepicker($.datepicker.regional['de']); ?
[07:56:21] <Elirips> BillCriswell: Yes, this works for the DatePicker part
[07:56:37] <Elirips> but the time-sliders added by the datetimePicker do not update
[07:56:49] <BillCriswell> Not familiar with those.
[07:57:57] <BillCriswell> Not sure what a time-slider is at all now that I'm googling.
[07:59:01] <BillCriswell> oh, time picker plugin? It looks like you might need to destroy and init againa
[07:59:45] <Elirips> yes, I'm using the time picker plugin
[08:00:17] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking you'll need to do the first thing I mentioned, unless you feel like digging into the plugins code.. which I sure don't haha
[08:03:49] <BillCriswell> Elirips: Are you sure the localization you're setting has the variables from this localization tab set: http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ ?
[08:05:19] <BillCriswell> Elirips: That localization tab actually tells you just what to do.
[08:12:59] <hanshenrik> https://com.google/
[08:13:04] <hanshenrik> how the hell did they do that
[08:16:05] <eskatrem> Hey, I have an issue with drag and drop on this web page: http://magako.com/new-interface2
[08:16:10] <eskatrem> just on firefox
[08:17:05] <eskatrem> when I go to this link and try to drag the '+', the "13" goes to the bottom, for the life of me I don't understand what's going on
[08:17:26] <BillCriswell> hanshenrik: Does it work outside of chrome?
[08:17:35] <BillCriswell> Waits for firefox to load...
[08:18:01] <BillCriswell> Ah it does... guess that's a good tld lol
[08:18:08] <eskatrem> tld?
[08:18:18] <hanshenrik> tld?
[08:18:40] <hanshenrik> can someone test in internet explorer?
[08:19:02] <hanshenrik> (i have disabled ASLR, and IE is the only browser in the world not capable of running without ASLR..)
[08:19:13] <eskatrem> I have a VM with IE8 (or 9) to test stuff if you want
[08:19:18] <hanshenrik> gogogo
[08:19:21] <DragonPunch> $.post('htpp://api.scribear.com/new_status', {
[08:19:21] <DragonPunch> 							token: token,
[08:19:21] <DragonPunch> 							msg: statusmsg
[08:19:21] <DragonPunch> 						});
[08:19:24] <DragonPunch> does taht look right?
[08:19:32] <BillCriswell> hanshenrik: top level domain
[08:19:36] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: give me the link please
[08:19:43] <BillCriswell> hanshenrik: or are you asking about how they made everything in reverse?
[08:19:44] <hanshenrik> DragonPunch, syntaxically, yes
[08:19:50] <hanshenrik> eskatrem, https://com.google/
[08:20:02] <hanshenrik> BillCriswell, yes i am asking how they managed to reverse everything
[08:20:09] <BillCriswell> oh lol
[08:20:10] <hanshenrik> even search results (thus its not hardcoded)
[08:20:15] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: didn't you want someone to test something for you on explorer?
[08:20:22] <hanshenrik> eskatrem, yes, this website https://com.google/
[08:20:37] <eskatrem> ah, you want to see if that works on explorer. ok I'll have a look
[08:20:49] <BillCriswell> imagine a body { transform: rotate(180deg); } somewhere.
[08:21:17] <BillCriswell> yup, that's it.
[08:21:52] <hanshenrik> cool
[08:21:54] <hanshenrik> thanks
[08:21:57] <BillCriswell> welcome
[08:23:07] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: no, doesn't work on IE, it just displays the normal google
[08:23:20] <hanshenrik> eskatrem, thanks
[08:23:33] <hanshenrik> (why am i not surprised?)
[08:24:31] <hanshenrik> days before jQuery: http://blueprintds.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/web-developer-walrus-meme-generator-one-day-to-design-and-code-six-days-to-fix-compatibility-with-old-browsers-2ce5b9.jpg
[08:24:46] <hanshenrik> with jQuery its way easier..
[08:25:26] <eskatrem> seriously, has someone checked my page with firefox? I really don't know what's causing my bug
[08:26:35] <hanshenrik> eskatrem, what page?
[08:26:44] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: http://magako.com/new-interface2
[08:26:59] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: open it with firefox and try to drag the "+"
[08:27:00] <hanshenrik> firefox-specific bug?
[08:27:04] <eskatrem> I think
[08:27:16] <eskatrem> on chrome it works fine
[08:27:32] <hanshenrik> what's the bug?
[08:27:45] <fadey> hey guys, is there somewhere I can read up on the security restrictions on $.trigger(event)
[08:27:46] <Elirips> BillCriswell: sorry for late answer. Yes it works using the doc from that localization tab. But only to set the initial language. Cannot change it while things are running.
[08:27:55] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: have you tried to drag the "+" somewhere?
[08:27:56] <fadey> sounds like something that wouldn't be allowed everywhere
[08:28:23] <eskatrem> it makes the "13" go below the rest
[08:29:20] <hanshenrik> eskatrem, have you tried moving the "position:relative" up a few elements?
[08:29:24] <fadey> I guess first I should ask, is trigger() restricted by browser in some way?
[08:29:58] <eskatrem> hanshenrik: hmm that's a good idea actually
[08:30:12] <robertmaxrees> fadey nope, but it's not really the "right way" to do things usually.
[08:31:37] <fadey> That's surprising, I would've thought that programmatically causing events is dangerous in some way
[08:32:02] <robertmaxrees> it's not dangerous, but it does break separations of concern most of the time.
[08:37:49] <buzzedword> hey guys, quick question. been a bit since i've used data attributes + jquery-- is it still a no-no to use $.fn.data when there's a chance the data attribute is undefined?
[08:38:12] <robertmaxrees> it's never been a no-no imo.
[08:38:13] <buzzedword> quick tests look like it properly reports undefined and defined now, compared to in the past
[08:38:40] <buzzedword> robertmaxrees: so, definitely safe to use .data over .attr("data-?")
[08:38:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd say so.
[08:39:26] <buzzedword> awesome. thanks, it's been bothering me for a bit why i'm still holding that old advice
[08:39:34] <buzzedword> feels circa 1.5
[08:46:36] <forQuery> anyone know how to say, if there is a console log message, display that message and also display the title of the page next to it?
[08:51:12] <robertmaxrees> display that message in the console?
[08:51:20] <Omar-> forQuery console.log( "your message", $("title").text() );
[08:51:28] <forQuery> well, but, what if there is an error message
[08:51:32] <forQuery> that we did not log manually
[08:51:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[08:51:46] <Omar-> hmmm
[08:51:48] <robertmaxrees> why
[08:52:16] <forQuery> because, im working on this cool website builder that has iframes and... it would be nice if when one of the widgets had an error, the console would help find out what widget the error came from
[08:52:47] <forQuery> they currently use mongodb unique id as url, so url doesnt work well.. and that part would be harder for me to change.
[08:54:00] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for try/catch
[08:54:08] <robertmaxrees> any code that might error needs to be wrapped.
[08:54:59] <forQuery> yes, i should read more about try catch.  thanks for that direction robert
[08:55:42] <robertmaxrees> you also need to test if the browser actually has a console available before throwing things randomly into it.  old IE doesn't have a console object unless the console is already open.
[08:56:52] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: can you explain why jquery collecitons look like a normal array of nodes in console.log? is it something jquery does (like .toConsole or some such thing?)?
[08:57:05] <cjohnson> or is console seeing that it's array-like and printing it that way
[08:57:10] <robertmaxrees> the latter :)
[08:58:19] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[08:58:31] <robertmaxrees> the individual object with the jquery object ARE DOM nodes.
[08:58:48] <robertmaxrees> that's why when you access $('.someSelector')[0], you get the non-jqueryfied version of it.
[08:59:01] <forQuery> lol ive wondered why ppl do that for soooo long
[08:59:38] <robertmaxrees> more often than not they're doing it because they don't know how to access individual nodes the right way - you'll see people do things like $($('.someSelector')[0]), which is wrong.
[08:59:49] <forQuery> so it's sort of like... try {all the js from the page here} catch (error) {  something with console.log and error variable }
[09:00:13] <robertmaxrees> sort of.  one sec.
[09:00:20] <cjohnson> [0] is same as .get(0)?
[09:00:27] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[09:00:32] <cjohnson> neat
[09:01:18] <robertmaxrees> forQuery http://fixee.org/paste/glz5mpf/
[09:01:26] <robertmaxrees> you need to test for the console object first
[09:02:14] <forQuery> sweet
[09:02:38] <forQuery> and if i wanted to put title of page, i could just put that below the console.log(e) in the normal way one would get a title
[09:03:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not really the best way to do it.
[09:03:59] <forQuery> yes
[09:04:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd add an extra property to the error object for the original page title or something like that.
[09:04:30] <forQuery> oh, cool
[09:06:40] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/glz5mpf/#url=tgf2tuq i'd do something like this maybe.
[09:07:37] <forQuery> awesome!  im trying now :)
[09:22:20] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day so far.
[09:23:48] <forQuery> it worked great robert
[09:23:52] <forQuery> thank you for this
[09:24:03] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[09:46:04] <decx> sounds like a magician
[09:46:08] <decx> the great robert
[09:46:14] <robertmaxrees> haha
[09:51:31] <t0th_-_> hi
[09:51:35] <t0th_-_> i have this  selected = $(".produto").find(".comparar_selected");
[09:51:48] <t0th_-_> but it is returned <div></div>, how can i return jquery elements?
[09:51:54] <robertmaxrees> you have them.
[09:52:03] <robertmaxrees> .find() returns a jquery object.
[09:52:42] <t0th_-_> ok, i have this  selected.each(function( i ) { }
[09:52:53] <t0th_-_> when try selected[i].children i have an error
[09:53:09] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this).children()
[09:53:34] <robertmaxrees> selected[i] gets the underlying DOM node, which doesn't have .children() available on it.
[09:53:54] <t0th_-_> testing
[09:53:55] <t0th_-_> thanks, man
[09:53:56] <t0th_-_> working
[09:54:00] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[10:13:09] <nikhil_> why am i getting TypeError: undefined is not a function here: https://dpaste.de/m2vZ#L6 ?
[10:14:46] <decx> you try to call .text() on an vanilla element
[10:14:53] <nikhil_> why am i getting TypeError: undefined is not a function here: https://dpaste.de/m2vZ#L6 ?
[10:15:41] <nikhil_> thanks, do i need to wrap it with $()?
[10:16:20] <decx> use eq(0) instead of [0]
[10:16:40] <nikhil_> decx, i dont understand that. to get the first element?
[10:19:26] <decx> yes?
[10:24:38] <Omar-> !api html
[10:24:38] <b-ot> Omar-: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[10:25:16] <Omar-> adv_ ^^
[10:31:18] <wolfram74> So I get $("a") get's all link elements, and $(".article") get's every element with the article class, shouldn't $("a .article") select for links with the article class?
[10:32:26] <decx> no
[10:33:31] <wolfram74> but it is not an unreasonable kind of selection, I just tested it my way and, yeah, negative results
[10:33:52] <wolfram74> how would I select for those two criterion?
[10:34:01] <decx> i assume you don't come from css
[10:34:22] <decx> nospace
[10:34:34] <candelabra> for jQuery.each, is there a way to reference the original object withing the callback?
[10:34:37] <wolfram74> I have done very little css so far
[10:34:40] <wolfram74> but thanks decx
[10:34:47] <decx> well you are excused then
[10:35:02] <decx> parent descendent
[10:35:10] <decx> #parent.parent
[10:35:11] <basiclaser> Hey guys, please can you check this .serialize() attempt of mine? I'm trying to make a constantly updated object which is derived from a serialized form http://jsbin.com/guyokoziwu/1/edit?js,console,output
[10:35:27] <wolfram74> mwahahaha, it works
[10:35:36] <basiclaser> it seems simple enough, but when the serialised version is printed, it is an empty string
[10:35:57] <decx> what do you mean with original object candelabra
[10:36:26] <decx> your inputs need names basiclaser
[10:36:26] <candelabra> like... jQuery.each(my_object,function(key,value){ //want my_object in here}
[10:38:02] <basiclaser> decx: thanks, is it possible to make the method look for id's instead of names?
[10:38:14] <decx> i dont get it candelabra, if you want to use my_object just use my_object?!
[10:38:21] <candelabra> its not available
[10:38:43] <decx> but you use my_object in the parent scope already??
[10:38:46] <decx> fiddle up
[10:38:53] <candelabra> working on it
[10:39:22] <decx> basiclaser you can create you own serialize i guess
[10:39:39] <decx> just add names
[10:40:31] <basiclaser> great i got it working in any case, thanks alot decx
[10:41:16] <decx> i will thank alot when i see him
[10:42:26] <basiclaser> decx: thats deep broah, woah
[10:43:57] <candelabra> decx: weird works in the fiddle
[10:44:10] <candelabra> but in my chrome developer tools stopped in a debugger inside the loop... says undefined
[10:44:45] <candelabra> decx: probably the debugger was at the end...
[10:45:02] <decx> debugger was like: aprils fools brah
[10:45:54] <candelabra> decx: weird,, no its still not working
[10:46:05] <candelabra> maybe because its being passed from a function argument
[10:48:20] <thealphanerd> early bird tickets are on sale for jQuerySF ya’ll!!!
[10:48:27] <thealphanerd> —> https://ti.to/jquerysf/2015
[10:58:09] <candelabra> decx: I'm not crazy, but I can't explain it
[10:58:23] <decx> that's what the people in the ward said
[10:58:35] <candelabra> decx: I'm switching to a for..in
[10:58:40] <candelabra> decx: that's faster anyway
[11:00:09] <Rainb> what are the best practices to store data, as in lots of objects, which can be converted to Classes, or prototyped objects.  Currently I just have a huge array of initializations [new C(data),new C(data),new C(data),new C(data)...]
[11:12:22] <MikeD_> can someone tell me why the parameters are reversed between .each() and .map() ?
[11:13:36] <noober_0003> hello, i was wondering if i want to make a popup using jquery that shows a whole form, what should i use
[11:14:37] <supsup> jqueryui dialog perhaps
[11:14:54] <supsup> lot of people use colorbox i don't know i like jqueryui better tho
[11:15:00] <supsup> there are tons of dialog box plugins tho
[11:15:29] <noober_0003> ok thanks
[11:29:21] <fracture_pandeya> hello, i can use urls in query string?
[11:30:36] <supsup> sure encode them
[11:31:26] <fracture_pandeya> var encoded = encodeURIComponent(str); ?
[11:31:48] <supsup> i would assume so just try it in your console
[11:33:05] <supsup> then decode it later where you want to use it
[11:34:16] <supsup> tho i don't know maybe that is a bad idea heh maybe just do a replace on some characters instead
[11:34:27] <robertmaxrees> use encodeURIComponent.
[11:34:30] <robertmaxrees> that's what it's for.
[11:34:31] <supsup> like %2F to /
[11:34:48] <supsup> otherwise someone might put xss in your param
[11:35:00] <robertmaxrees> that's why you use a library to handle the server-side :)
[11:36:12] <fracture_pandeya> hm its weird, show as undefined
[11:36:22] <supsup> make jsfiddle
[11:36:52] <fracture_pandeya> http://pastebin.com/cWZajPDx
[11:36:58] <fracture_pandeya> jsfiddle, ok
[11:37:31] <robertmaxrees> and don't use .attr() for data attributes
[11:37:31] <viju> I've recently started doing development in UI. My colleagues insist me to use firebug instead of the tool that comes with firefox. I wonder what is there so superior about it. Unfortunately, I am newbie to all this.
[11:37:43] <t4nk982> Today, one of my intranet's website has started to load slow on chrome...The page has jquery plugins..the page loads faster in firefox and IE....I ran CPU Profile, and see that getPropertyValue from jquery-1.7 is causing the issue...I also see e.f.extend.hide from jquery ui is causing the issue...
[11:38:27] <supsup> viju: i use chrome think it's kind of personal pref and how well you know the tools, guessing firebug has extra features vs what default firefox  has
[11:38:54] <fracture_pandeya> I use chrome too
[11:39:14] <robertmaxrees> viju the current FF dev tools are very good.
[11:39:17] <t4nk982> Could chrome update can cause this issue?
[11:39:19] <fracture_pandeya> weird, when i make a jsfiddle, click on save, it just takes me to create a new fiddle
[11:40:01] <fracture_pandeya> dont use attr then use what
[11:40:21] <fracture_pandeya> .data() ?
[11:41:37] <supsup> fracture: http://jsfiddle.net/zwe9g56t/
[11:42:10] <supsup> think most browsers also naturally encode the address bar tho i get confused about that.
[11:42:17] <supsup> like for params
[11:42:26] <fracture_pandeya> hm ok but i am trying to pass that into a query string
[11:43:46] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do, fracture_pandeya?
[11:44:11] <fracture_pandeya> weird thing is i cannot save the jsfiddle..
[11:44:20] <robertmaxrees> there should be an "update" button
[11:44:26] <fracture_pandeya> yes
[11:44:28] <supsup> i don't know mine saved fine
[11:44:41] <fracture_pandeya> it takes me back to jsfiddle.net
[11:44:52] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[11:44:56] <robertmaxrees> weird.

[11:45:33] <supsup> robert do you know if it is best practice to always encode param values ?   or can you just trust brower to do it for you
[11:45:37] <fracture_pandeya> this is what i am trying to do...
[11:45:47] <robertmaxrees> fracture_pandeya why are you doing this, though?
[11:45:54] <fracture_pandeya> and it returns as ?link=undefined
[11:46:11] <robertmaxrees> supsup depends - in this case, you want to explicitly encode that value.
[11:46:17] <supsup> to switch location of the window
[11:46:22] <supsup> is what he is trying to do
[11:46:36] <supsup> kind of a weird way to do it lol
[11:46:37] <robertmaxrees> err, sort of.  they're passing that data server-side using the URL.
[11:46:40] <supsup> why not just have href value set?
[11:46:41] <fracture_pandeya> there is a page, which has many links, each link has to go to a disclaimer, which will have the full url of the review that person clicked on the previous page, so am passing it in query string and will grab the url from the query string in the next page, lol
[11:46:54] <fracture_pandeya> i hope i made myself clear
[11:47:05] <fracture_pandeya> that's the reason why
[11:47:08] <fracture_pandeya> ^^
[11:47:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fms7nkcx/ works fine.
[11:47:26] <supsup> why not just set the href of the anchor tag to:  http://www.somedomain.com/?link=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/index.html
[11:47:27] <robertmaxrees> not sure why you're getting "undefined"
[11:47:38] <fracture_pandeya> yes
[11:47:38] <supsup> because he is using attr
[11:47:41] <fracture_pandeya> that works fine
[11:47:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:47:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to escape that.
[11:47:56] <fracture_pandeya> try to set it in window.redirect
[11:48:00] <supsup> yeah i ment with encodes
[11:48:07] <supsup> but you should just remove the prevent default
[11:48:10] <supsup> set the href on the click
[11:48:17] <supsup> then just let the anchor tag do its normal thing
[11:48:45] <robertmaxrees> fracture_pandeya that looks like it works just fine.
[11:48:46] <fracture_pandeya> try to do this..
[11:48:46] <fracture_pandeya> window.location = 'http://www.somedomain.com/?link=' + link;
[11:48:59] <robertmaxrees> supsup that's really inefficient client-side.
[11:49:05] <robertmaxrees> the "right" way to do this is all server-side.
[11:50:40] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/xcsa7av3/
[11:50:59] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:51:09] <fracture_pandeya> just noticed am getting two values in console.log :-?
[11:51:10] <supsup> pretty sure thats what he wants to do tho
[11:51:18] <robertmaxrees> do this server-side.
[11:51:43] <fracture_pandeya> hm ok
[11:52:30] <supsup> yah i guess it's not right tho does not go to url did not test the href set
[11:52:34] <fracture_pandeya> actually yeah, why didnt i think of that
[11:52:45] <supsup> used console and assumed href thing would work
[11:52:47] <robertmaxrees> lol trust me, you really want to do this server-side.
[11:52:55] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's going to be super fragile.
[11:52:55] <fracture_pandeya> yeah did it server side
[11:53:01] <fracture_pandeya> looks good now
[11:53:17] <supsup> cool
[11:53:18] <fracture_pandeya> 2 am here
[11:53:27] <fracture_pandeya> why didn't i think of this before
[11:53:29] <adv_> can i have multiple data sent with an .ajax post request? like data:{ id: id, name: name}
[11:53:32] <supsup> i was assuming it was pure html or something
[11:53:36] <robertmaxrees> adv_ yep.
[11:53:43] <supsup> like no backende
[11:53:57] <supsup> functional backend
[11:53:57] <naftilos76> Is there a way to detect a div's dimension change?
[11:54:08] <robertmaxrees> naftilos76 not efficiently.
[11:55:27] <supsup> robert whats funny is what you were saying is what i always say at work...why are we doing this front-end ;-0
[11:56:27] <adv_> robertmaxrees: with one arg it succeeds, with two it fails with typeerror:illegal invocation
[11:56:34] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ adv_
[11:56:34] <b-ot> adv_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:57:03] <naftilos76> robertmaxrees: I have seen somewhere an implementation of something similar by the use of .attrchange(function(){}); Is this a good aproach?
[11:57:31] <robertmaxrees> naftilos76 no - change the function that's updating the Div's size instead.
[11:57:44] <adv_> http://pastebin.com/6xKGYcgK robertmaxrees
[11:58:07] <robertmaxrees> adv_ you have extra commas in there.
[11:58:34] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/32zh7uc/
[11:59:01] <naftilos76> robertmaxrees: there is no such function. The div's size is changed when the browser's window is resized. I could catch that with window.resize but i was hoping for something closer to the div itself.
[11:59:23] <robertmaxrees> naftilos76 then you want the resize event, though that's code smell.  what're you working with?
[11:59:45] <adv_> robertmaxrees: still
[12:00:05] <robertmaxrees> adv_ dunno then.  did you properly define those vars?  do you get that error when you comment that block out?
[12:00:24] <adv_> when i comment out the 6th line (name line) then it works
[12:01:16] <adv_> ah!
[12:01:31] <adv_> robertmaxrees: id is js var , but name is html id
[12:01:41] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[12:01:55] <adv_> so how can i post the contents of name field
[12:02:06] <naftilos76> robertmaxrees: It is rails+html+js . The div is just containing a table with each td being an ajax link. When someone resizes the entire window, that list is offset towards the top of the div's parent el ad stays there when the browser windown is maximised.
[12:02:23] <robertmaxrees> adv_ var theName = $('.theInput').val();
[12:02:34] <robertmaxrees> then use theName in the data object.
[12:02:35] <fracture_pandeya> naftilos76 this plugin can do it > http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[12:03:27] <robertmaxrees> i still say it's code smell, but meh.
[12:04:00] <naftilos76> ok thanks, i ll try attrchange though
[12:04:17] <robertmaxrees> that's a plugin, too.
[12:04:31] <robertmaxrees> and has nothing to do with what you're trying to accomplish.
[12:05:04] <adv_> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:05:53] <fracture_pandeya> ?
[12:07:49] <naftilos76> robertmaxrees: you're right! I didn't notice that :-)
[12:15:21] <fracture_pandeya> hi
[12:15:22] <f0ster> Can anyone explain why the jquery event trigger isnt working, the regular JS event is, http://jsfiddle.net/k2W6M/ ?
[12:15:39] <robertmaxrees> because jquery events and native dom events are different.
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k2W6M/5/
[12:16:25] <f0ster> robertmaxrees: quite surprised, it seems pretty reasonable to expect that doing a jquery click() or trigger('click') would trigger a dom click event
[12:17:06] <robertmaxrees> jquery fills in a lot of holes between browsers and enhances things quite a bit.  i could see where the expectation comes from, but you need to use jquery for both sides.
[12:17:50] <robertmaxrees> triggering using the native DOM system works for both, fwiw: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/k2W6M/6/
[12:18:09] <f0ster> right, well I am writing a chrome extension, and I am using jquery, but I am just trying to simulate a normal click
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> then use document.getElementsByTagName("a")[0].click();
[12:18:26] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it.
[12:18:30] <f0ster> robertmaxrees: that's what I found but i definitely wasted a couple hours figuring it out

[12:22:55] <robertmaxrees> fixee.org is another great choice.
[12:22:59] <robertmaxrees> really simple.
[12:23:11] <fracture_pandeya> eww that background color

[12:23:50] <fracture_pandeya> xybrek: don't mind but keep it as clean as possible
[12:27:04] <xybrek> fracture_pandeya: thanks, does it look cluttered?
[12:29:46] <robertmaxrees> xybrek these colors are really bright.
[12:29:52] <robertmaxrees> and why do you need my location?
[12:30:29] <Rainb> so i can come there
[12:31:58] <xybrek> robertmaxrees: its for a feature
[12:32:16] <robertmaxrees> what feature?
[12:32:58] <xybrek> robertmaxrees: search by relative location
[13:57:02] <Zzaichik> It's oh, so quiet…

[14:27:21] <ysfm> hi i'm using jquery mobile a chat system but i have a problem, jMobile is running in all div. i want jmobile running only in a special div. Is it possible?
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> that's overkill.
[14:28:26] <teste01> hi there
[14:28:46] <teste01> i need some help with php
[14:28:53] <teste01> someone?
[14:29:35] <DragAndDrop> teste01, you could try #php
[14:29:50] <teste01> i can't enter
[14:29:56] <teste01> invite only.. :(
[14:30:29] <teste01> i have multiple forms on the same php, is this right to work?
[14:37:43] <robertmaxrees> teste01 you want ##php
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> and you need to register an account for it.
[14:37:52] <teste01> ok
[14:38:00] <teste01> i'm tring
[14:38:03] <teste01> traying
[15:14:56] <rubyonrailed> How do I use on.('change') with a appended class?
[15:15:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:15:09] <robertmaxrees> like, a dynamically added class?
[15:15:30] <rubyonrailed> Yeah
[15:15:38] <robertmaxrees> event delegation
[15:15:38] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:15:50] <robertmaxrees> $('.parent').on('change', '.someClass', function() {});
[15:21:09] <sagittarian|2> does anyone know where I can find event handlers that have been registered with on document ready?
[15:21:29] <sagittarian|2> I was expecting to find them in $._data(document, 'events') but they don't seem to be there
[15:23:42] <Nico_> Hello
[15:24:01] <decx> it's on the dom element, not document sagittarian|2
[15:24:02] <Nico_> Anyone here?
[15:24:44] <Zzaichik> kinda
[15:25:04] <Nico_> Can anyone tell me wether there is a function that returns true/false on keydown
[15:25:06] <Nico_> ?
[15:25:42] <decx> what for?
[15:25:57] <Zzaichik> You could probably create an event, sure. but ^^
[15:26:01] <sagittarian|2> decx: which dom element?
[15:26:38] <decx> well the element that you assigned the handler to
[15:26:55] <Nico_> I have an event on keyup and i want a variable to be false if any key is not pressed down
[15:27:18] <sagittarian|2> decx: you mean with $(function () {}) or $(document).ready(function () {})? wouldn't that be the document?
[15:28:06] <decx> maybe i'm misunderstanding
[15:30:46] <Zzaichik> $('element').on('keydown', function() { return false; var myVar = false; }); something like that? Nico_
[15:30:58] <Zzaichik> probably don't need the "return false;"
[15:32:13] <Nico_> My problem is that when i press a key then press another while that one is pressed and lifts the first key the character stops moving for a short amount of time
[15:32:17] <robertmaxrees> that code woudln't do anything anyway.
[15:32:19] <Nico_> I want to prevent that
[15:34:50] <decx> your keydown and up functions should have access to your player object
[15:35:08] <decx> there you can have properties for controls
[15:35:15] <decx> left: true or whatever
[15:35:33] <Zomas> hi. $("#registration_form").submit(function() { alert('hey'); } doesnt react to form#registration_form submit with <button type="submit">. where could i find the solution to the problem? :/
[15:37:22] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cyh0uLqd/ works fine
[15:37:29] <robertmaxrees> does the form get added after pageload?
[15:37:46] <Zzaichik> it's probably the preventDefault()
[15:37:50] <Zzaichik> that's making a diff
[15:37:58] <robertmaxrees> prolly
[15:38:15] <Zzaichik> Zomas: ^
[15:38:31] <Zomas> http://jsfiddle.net/ua55Lnnb/ this don
[15:38:33] <Zomas> dont*
[15:38:48] <Zomas> but ty
[15:38:51] <robertmaxrees> that;'s not valid code
[15:38:52] <Zomas> i will do it your way
[15:38:58] <Zomas> ty :)
[15:39:12] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ua55Lnnb/1/
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> you were missing a closing );
[15:41:28] <Zomas> http://jsfiddle.net/ua55Lnnb/ why this dont work?
[15:41:28] <Zomas> :/
[15:41:34] <Zomas> i need to get it by id
[15:41:38] <robertmaxrees> because your code isn't valid.
[15:41:43] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a closing );
[15:41:47] <robertmaxrees> and jquery isn't included.
[15:42:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ua55Lnnb/2/ again
[15:42:26] <Zomas> oh
[15:42:36] <Zomas> i thought it is done automaticaly. jquery i mean
[15:42:42] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:45:00] <Zomas> strange. in jsfiddle copied code from my project works, but not in my project. and there is <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> a few lines before my code.
[15:45:19] <robertmaxrees> is your JS before your html?
[15:45:44] <robertmaxrees> try somethng like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ua55Lnnb/4/
[15:46:02] <Zomas> yeah, in <head>
[15:46:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's why - the HTML doesn't exist yet.  can't bind to what isn't there.
[15:46:48] <Zomas> perfect
[15:46:49] <Zomas> thank you
[15:46:50] <Zomas> :)
[15:46:55] <robertmaxrees> either use a document ready (like i just did) or move your code before the closing body tag.
[15:47:13] <Zomas> is it good practice to add js after whole html?
[15:47:40] <robertmaxrees> generally, yes - you should put all your JS in a separate script file and link it before </body>
[15:48:05] <Zomas> hmm
[15:48:20] <robertmaxrees> it's a little more complex than that, but that's the basic gist.
[15:48:22] <Zomas> interesting. i thought everything should be in <head>. well, thank you for enlighting me :)
[15:48:29] <Zomas> where could i read more about it?
[15:49:43] <robertmaxrees> search google.  really broad topic.
[15:50:07] <Zomas> ty
[15:56:23] <Syntax_> hi
[15:56:40] <robertmaxrees> hey Syntax_!
[15:57:13] <Cammo1> anyone here familiar with datatables? I saw someone from here posted on thier website..
[15:57:27] <robertmaxrees> Cammo1 hrm?
[15:57:31] <Cammo1> Im trying to figure out what Im supposed to return from the backend when there are no results from the query..
[15:57:33] <robertmaxrees> a lot of us know of datatables.
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably have more luck on the datatables foums.
[15:57:46] <robertmaxrees> *forums
[15:58:01] <Cammo1> if I dont return anything, I get "loading" if I return a "" I get invalid json response
[15:58:13] <robertmaxrees> try maybe just {} ?
[15:58:32] <Cammo1> all I can come up with is to return a blank array... but people on the forums are saying they get "no matching data" or "no records found" ect..
[15:58:52] <Cammo1> I want one of those to display... and they are trying to get rid of them..
[15:59:05] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  you'll need to ask there since they'll have more information.
[15:59:16] <Syntax_> has anyone had a look at the reddit button today?
[15:59:17] <Cammo1> well you have to echo something back to the frontend waiting for a response
[15:59:43] <Cammo1> or it just says "loading"
[15:59:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:00:30] <robertmaxrees> not sure how to phrase this diffrently, Cammo1 - you'll probably have more luck in their forums.
[16:00:50] <Cammo1> ok.. well you said lots of people knew datatables here..
[16:01:05] <robertmaxrees> i said lots of people know OF datatables :) i was being smarmy.
[16:01:22] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14375771/how-to-show-empty-data-message-in-datatables
[16:01:23] <robertmaxrees> fwiw
[16:02:13] <Cammo1> umm yeah.. that works fine and dandy when the front end isnt waiting for a response
[16:02:37] <Cammo1> my question was what to send from the backend to the frontend to let it know there are 0 rows returned
[16:03:17] <sacho_> an empty array
[16:03:46] <Cammo1> then I get a row on the front end with blank boxes instead of a message there were no rows returned
[16:03:49] <sacho_> I presume when you get n rows, you return an array with n elements.
[16:03:56] <Cammo1> right..
[16:04:09] <sacho_> well, fix the frontend.
[16:04:24] <Cammo1> you return a json encoded array with all the results
[16:04:35] <Cammo1> but if you have nothing to encode..
[16:04:35] <robertmaxrees> { "data": [] } - maybe this as the response?
[16:04:48] <robertmaxrees> shooting in the dark looking at their docs.
[16:07:52] <Cammo1> robertmaxrees, that worked..
[16:07:58] <robertmaxrees> there you go then!
[16:08:40] <Cammo1> where did you find that?
[16:09:04] <robertmaxrees> i looked at the docs and found some examples of the data you should return to the frontend.  extrapolated from there.
[16:10:40] <Cammo1> I cant find it anywhere on the site..
[16:11:10] <robertmaxrees> find what?
[16:11:26] <Cammo1> an example where they return a blank dataset
[16:11:43] <robertmaxrees> right - again, i looked at some examples of data you SHOULD return to the frontend, and extrapolated from there.
[16:12:25] <robertmaxrees> it stands to reason that if the return should contain a data property that's an array of results, an empty array would be no results.
[16:12:42] <robertmaxrees> fulfilling the contract of the object - it's an array.  just an array of nothing.
[16:15:28] <Cammo1> thanks.. I tried returning everything but a blank array
[16:31:47] <dunkel2> hello
[16:32:36] <dunkel2> im trying to use $.ajax but im getting this XMLHttpRequest cannot load url. Origin http://localhost:8000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[16:39:28] <robertmaxrees> sounds about right.
[16:39:30] <robertmaxrees> cross-domain
[16:39:55] <robertmaxrees> dunkel2 your page needs to be on the same port, protocol, and domain, or the server needs to allow CORS.
[16:40:16] <dunkel2> i used jsonp as data type and everythign works now
[16:40:22] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[16:40:47] <dunkel2> thank you
[16:40:49] <dunkel2> :D
[16:57:06] <JAAulde> With the new method of publishing jQuery plugins through NPM, is there anywhere that keeps a searchable/filterable list of jQuery plugins now, or does one just search NPM?
[16:57:43] <snover> i believe one simply cries
[16:57:56] <JAAulde> ha, okey dokey then!
[16:58:00] <robertmaxrees> if you want ones available via NPM, search NPM.
[16:58:01] * JAAulde sits down and works up a good fit
[16:58:06] <robertmaxrees> not all of them will be there, fwiw.
[16:58:36] <JAAulde> @robertmaxrees right, I just know that jQuery changed the "official" way of registering them
[16:58:56] <snover> it was more of a defeatist move than a strategic one
[16:59:21] <JAAulde> I published one today with the jQuery keywords, and see it on NPM (and in bower where I also registered it), but don't see it on the jQueyr plugin site. I assume the jQuery plugin site is kind of dead?
[16:59:31] <JAAulde> @snover ah, ok.
[16:59:36] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that NPM is the "official" way?
[16:59:53] <JAAulde> @robertmaxrees http://plugins.jquery.com
[16:59:54] <snover> robertmaxrees: it got put on the plugins site
[16:59:59] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[16:59:59] <JAAulde> "We recommend moving to npm, using "jquery-plugin" as the keyword in your package.json. The npm blog has instructions for publishing your plugin to npm."
[17:00:05] <snover> not because npm actually is usable for jquery plugins
[17:00:07] <snover> (it isn’t)
[17:00:08] <robertmaxrees> ah, they recommend moving there.
[17:00:10] <robertmaxrees> fwiw.
[17:00:20] <robertmaxrees> i get it.
[17:00:43] <JAAulde> @robertmaxrees if I follow the old way, will it show up on the jQ site? I had tried that as well and never saw it, then saw the NPM instructions and followed them
[17:01:02] <robertmaxrees> "The jQuery Plugin Registry is in read-only mode."
[17:01:19] <robertmaxrees> as in, they won't be updating it.  that's why.
[17:01:19] <JAAulde> HAHA, I saw the little text and missed the big stuff
[17:01:38] <JAAulde> ok, oh well. I've done what i can for now then I gues
[17:01:45] <JAAulde> thanks @robertmaxrees and @snover
[17:01:52] <robertmaxrees> a lot of people publish via github as well, btw.
[17:02:00] <robertmaxrees> as well as making it available via npm.
[17:02:08] <JAAulde> @robertmaxrees Mine is on github, is that what you mean?
[17:02:17] <robertmaxrees> you can tag things with releases, etc.
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> so users can get it from there, too.
[17:02:31] <JAAulde> @robertmaxrees https://github.com/JAAulde/jquery-cookies
[17:02:32] <albedoa> i have a mouseup event that removes an anchor link element but doesn't register the link click before removing the element. how do i do that? if ($('#share').length) { $('#share').remove(); }
[17:02:48] <JAAulde> @robertmaxrees https://www.npmjs.com/package/jaaulde-jquery-cookies
[17:02:51] <robertmaxrees> albedoa do what now?
[17:03:03] <albedoa> robertmaxrees sorry if i'm not clear
[17:03:13] <albedoa> that line removes an anchor link element on mouseup
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> albedoa and you have another listener on that link for the "click" event?
[17:03:38] <albedoa> robertmaxrees hmmmm maybe that's what i'm missing
[17:04:06] <albedoa> robertmaxrees thank you for the lead
[17:04:10] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[17:04:35] <robertmaxrees> still not even sure what the issue was but glad I could help hahaha
[17:26:22] <drei> hi all
[17:26:27] <drei> If less then 768px content gets appededed to each active list item creating an accordion like effect. All works fine except except when viewing on a tablet or mobile the accordion collapses on scrol - https://jsfiddle.net/p3a757fm/2/
[17:26:40] <drei> Any help much appreciated!
[17:26:56] <drei> *appended
[17:27:45] <drei> *collapses on scroll rather then staying open
[17:32:44] <drei> -
[17:32:46] <robertmaxrees> looks like the resize event is getting triggered somehow.
[17:36:36] <drei> what change can I make to not make the resize event not trigger - https://jsfiddle.net/p3a757fm/2/
[17:38:31] <drei> robertmaxrees: would the resize event getting triggered have anything to do with the content collapsing when scrolling on a mobile or tablet?
[17:38:44] <robertmaxrees> i'm just guessing.
[17:53:27] <testerbit> How can I rewrite this line so it runs faster?: $('td:eq(4)', row).html(out);
[18:11:52] <rcyr> testerbit: Why do you care?
[18:12:16] <testerbit> I remember reading about using jQuery traversal and now its bothering me
[18:12:31] <testerbit> can I rewrite using .find?
[18:12:41] <rcyr> It will be the same though.
[18:12:54] <rcyr> Just don't select nodes in a tight loop and you'll be fine.
[18:13:48] <testerbit> Its for a data tables, so it could be significant when it loads say 1000 rows?
[18:14:23] <rcyr> terinjokes: Depends on the code... if it's doing something stupid like appending the rows one at a time, it will be slow as hell and it won't be cause of the selector.
[18:15:49] <rcyr> Sorry terinjokes ...
[18:15:53] <rcyr> testerbit :)
[18:16:07] <testerbit> Its doing it via the rowCallback in data tables, if your familiar, in any case, your saying the way its selected will not make any noticable performance  difference? Is it really that much more complex to write out the longer query?
[18:16:57] <rcyr> I never used your plugin but most of the time, selecting nodes is not the bottleneck, repainting/reflowing is.
[18:18:22] <testerbit> perhaps its not the bottleneck, but what is wrong with writing out the optimized version especially if its not much longer or harder to read?
[18:21:45] <symfonius> hello
[18:22:14] <symfonius> how can I select every element with a name matching "abcXXX" where XXX is some integer --- where the element is VISIBLE
[18:22:25] <symfonius> basically there's going to be a lot of elements with similar names that are hidden
[18:22:28] <tech-ninja> konbanwa
[18:22:29] <symfonius> ie. hide()
[18:22:35] <symfonius> or in divs with display:none
[18:22:46] <symfonius> i just want to get a list of each one that is visible
[18:23:17] <Emn1ty> so we're having an interesting issue. We're using Draggable on a navigation element that is position: fixed; The issue is, when we scroll the page the item drifts downwards from the cursor about as much as you have scrolled (ie. It does not stay with you as you scroll). We're trying to figure out why this is happening to correct for it. Anyone know anything about it?
[18:24:15] <symfonius> :visible I assume will be of use?
[18:24:31] <symfonius> but the wildcard names i'm not sure about
[18:24:37] <tech-ninja> if it’s id’s .. you could use a selector like this .. $(‘[id=*”abc-“])
[18:27:38] <tech-ninja> symfonius: something like this may be? https://gist.github.com/phreelyfe/08828d06518a8f155bd0
[18:28:14] <symfonius> possibly yeah
[18:28:16] <symfonius> $(‘[id=*”abc-“])
[18:28:18] <symfonius> what does that mean?
[18:29:24] <tech-ninja> capture all id’s starting with “abc-“
[18:29:51] <tech-ninja> it’s a wildcard selector
[18:30:02] <symfonius> ah ok
[18:30:13] <tech-ninja> hence the “*” after the id=
[18:30:13] <symfonius> is it possible to force it to look at integers?
[18:30:20] <tech-ninja> eg?
[18:30:24] <symfonius> because I have other divs starting with abc
[18:30:28] <symfonius> abc-test  < do not want
[18:30:33] <symfonius> abc123   < do want
[18:30:50] <tech-ninja> just put class on items you want to group
[18:31:14] <tech-ninja> id=“abc123” class=“group-this”
[18:31:22] <tech-ninja> id=“abc-test” class=“no-group”
[18:34:47] <symfonius> with this: $(‘[id=*”abc-“])
[18:34:56] <symfonius> can i make it so it will only look inside a certain class?
[18:35:17] <symfonius> like $('.my-container [id="abc"*]')
[18:35:21] <symfonius> or something like that
[18:35:36] <symfonius> <div class="my-container"> ....... looks inside here ........ </div>
[18:38:40] <testerbit> This is not working, how can I structure it correctly? Where row is an row index: $('td').eq(7, row).html(out);
[18:42:11] <testerbit> I actually this should be proper but does not work: $('td').eq(7).find('tr').eq(row).html(out);
[19:36:48] <Zeranoe> Does jquery support anything that can open box with another website in it? Something like opening Google in a page, but it's within a "dialog box" or something similar
[19:39:23] <screamingbanshee> Zeranoe like a frame? >_>
[19:41:12] <Zeranoe> screamingbanshee: Is there an example? I can tell you if it's what I'm looking for
[19:56:32] <aro> has anyone seen an issue where buttonset leaves a deselected radio input as active?
[20:03:06] <aro> has anyone seen that?
[20:27:10] <sadtaco> How can I have 'on' or 'live' behavior for an autocomplete?  I'm adding lots of new inputs that all use the same autocomplete resolver.  It can be hundreds of autocompletes and it seems inefficient to bind it for every one of them
[20:27:57] <aro> has anyone seen an issue where buttonset leaves a deselected radio input as active?
[20:39:03] <DragonPunch> how do you turn off text highlighting
[20:39:47] <adv_> 					<input name="upload_toggle1" type="checkbox" id="upload_toggle1" data-role="flipswitch">
[20:40:02] <adv_> how can i get the value of that flipswitch with jquery?
[20:41:04] <DragonPunch> uhh
[20:41:07] <DragonPunch> .val();
[20:42:33] <adv_> #upload_toggle1.val() ?
[20:44:12] <aro> has anyone seen an issue where buttonset leaves a deselected radio input as active?
[20:49:34] <tech-ninja> you got a gist?
[20:51:57] <tech-ninja> aro: $(‘#upload_toggle1”).removeClass(‘ui-flipswitch-active’) <— might be a start
[20:53:40] <symfonius> from a select dropdown
[20:53:45] <symfonius> instead of $().val()
[20:53:50] <symfonius> which would get the value obviously
[20:53:58] <symfonius> can I somehow get the text that appears?
[20:54:13] <symfonius> like if it was <option value="1">Hello</option>
[20:54:22] <symfonius> from the selector (of the select)
[20:54:26] <symfonius> how can I get the "Hello"?
[20:54:26] <aro> tech-ninja: shouldnt it remove it automatically?
[20:55:07] <tech-ninja> symfonius: .text() or .html()
[20:55:12] <symfonius> thanks
[20:55:18] <tech-ninja> aro: it should .. but i can’t see your code
[20:55:34] <aro> its simple. $('#radiobuttons').buttonset();
[20:57:25] <tech-ninja> does it stay active after you click it a couple of times?
[20:57:41] <aro> yes, even after i click it once
[20:57:45] <aro> its a radio button definitely
[20:57:54] <aro> but when i click the other buttons, it stays selected
[20:57:58] <aro> ui-state-active
[20:58:00] <aro> is there
[21:00:10] <tech-ninja> not sure
[21:00:18] <tech-ninja> looks like you’ve got it right
[21:00:26] <aro> it only does it on one page
[21:01:37] <tech-ninja> do you have any errors in the console?
[21:01:46] <aro> none
[21:02:37] <tech-ninja> you could setup event listeners on that button to manually remove the class, but it should be working properly otherwise
[21:04:36] <tech-ninja> try and initialize it disabled and see if it works when you click it
[21:04:38] <aro> why is this throwing 'cannot read property 'length' of undefined'
[21:04:39] <aro> $.each( $('#radio1').data('events'),function(i,e) { console.log(i,e); } );
[21:04:48] <aro> initialize it disabled? ok
[21:05:30] <tech-ninja> not sure whats going on with that each, but you’re missing a close parenth ) ….
[21:05:36] <tech-ninja> aro: did it work?
[21:05:48] <aro> let me try
[21:06:05] <aro> where am i missing a parenthesis?
[21:06:26] <tech-ninja> before semi colon
[21:06:48] <tech-ninja> your $.each( statement is not closed
[21:06:52] <aro> i added one and it said unexpected token )
[21:07:13] <tech-ninja> what are you trying to do?
[21:07:20] <aro> list the bindings of this element
[21:07:25] <aro> to see if something is clashing
[21:07:30] <tech-ninja> easier if you post a https://gist.github.com
[21:08:05] <aro> i do not see a missing paren
[21:08:45] <tech-ninja> you’re right .. sorry
[21:09:20] <aro> i just want to list bindings
[21:10:22] <tech-ninja> does $('#radio1').data('events') return an array?
[21:10:37] <tech-ninja> if you console.log it?
[21:10:46] <aro> it returns 'undefined'
[21:11:55] <tech-ninja> try like this .. $('#radio1').data('events’).each(function(i,e){console.log(i,e)})
[21:12:40] <aro> TypeError: Cannot read property 'each' of undefined
[21:12:55] <tech-ninja> theres  a fiddle here on it’s usage .. http://jsfiddle.net/968jj/
[21:13:38] <aro> hmm
[21:13:47] <aro> i wonder where the binding is stored for buttonset
[21:15:11] <tech-ninja> you should be able to log your #radio1 jquery object to the console and looks through it’s properties
[21:16:53] <aro> what should i look for?
[21:18:46] <tech-ninja> might be a buttonset property in there .. not sure
[21:19:33] <aro> there is
[21:22:17] <tech-ninja> sorry dude .. i’m on jq-ui’s site, and i can’t find any other clues
[21:42:38] <aro> heres whats weird
[21:42:40] <aro> you still there
[21:42:41] <aro> tech-ninja
[21:43:46] <tech-ninja> ye
[21:46:33] <tech-ninja> aro: gonna be here for a few more minutes. it’s 2am in good ol canada, lol
[21:48:56] <aro> its not unsetting the aria-pressed either
[21:48:59] <aro> its really weird
[21:49:04] <aro> it thinks its still clicked
[22:57:51] <surianup> Hi friends

[23:00:56] <surianup> this is my meanmenu js file http://jsfiddle.net/jgv50h1t/
[23:01:29] <surianup> can anyone help m eplease
[23:04:01] <surianup> ##jquery
[23:04:21] <surianup> #javascript
[23:10:58] <crandersons> surianup, answered you in #javascript
[23:15:34] <alaing> surianup: why you pm me?
[23:53:26] <symfonius> hi
[23:53:32] <symfonius> is there any jquery function for checking
[23:53:38] <symfonius> if some string is a key in a json array
[23:53:52] <Cork> symfonius: arrays doesn't have keys
[23:53:53] <symfonius> maybe tech-ninja is still around? ;)
[23:54:07] <symfonius> {'key': 'value'} ?
[23:54:12] <Cork> that's an object
[23:54:17] <symfonius> sorry
[23:54:22] <symfonius> I meant an array of objects then
[23:54:28] <Cork> just do obj[key] == undefined
[23:54:35] <Cork> ah
[23:54:40] <tech-ninja> for (key in OBJ)
[23:54:54] <Cork> so [{ "key": "value" }, { "key": "value" }]?
[23:54:56] <symfonius> so i'll have to loop through?
[23:55:00] <symfonius> Cork: Yes
[23:55:08] <Cork> then yes you have to loop
[23:55:13] <symfonius> ok
[23:55:14] <tech-ninja> arrays you pretty much always have to loop
[23:55:46] <tech-ninja> symfonius: isn’t it bedtime in some country?
[23:55:46] <symfonius> what is better, to use $.each or a for loop?
[23:56:08] <symfonius> tech-ninja: Australia - when we started talking it was about 10am
[23:56:09] <Cork> symfonius: depends if you need the scope $.each causes
[23:56:21] <Cork> if you don't just use a straight for loop
[23:56:27] <symfonius> ok
[23:56:35] <Cork> symfonius: btw do you need the resulting object?
[23:56:37] <tech-ninja> i like javascript methods better
[23:56:42] <Cork> or do you just want to know if it exist in there?
[23:56:46] <symfonius> Cork: Yes, I need to get the value
[23:56:51] <symfonius> I need to check if the key exists
[23:56:54] <symfonius> and if it does: get value
[23:57:37] <Cork> symfonius: then arr.filter(function(elm) { return 'key' in elm })
[23:58:21] <tech-ninja> why filter and not map?
[23:58:30] <Cork> map is jquery
[23:58:35] <tech-ninja> ah
[23:58:38] <Cork> but sure you could use $.map if you want
[23:59:00] <symfonius> Cork: Can you explain how that works? What am I matching against?
[23:59:11] <Cork> symfonius: elm is each object inside the array
[23:59:14] <symfonius> ie. say I'm looking for the case where key == "key_number_1"
[23:59:28] <Cork> symfonius: the filter looks for any object that has the key
[23:59:37] <Cork> and if it does keeps it in the new array it returns
[23:59:47] <Cork> so it gives you an array of all objects that had the key
[23:59:51] <symfonius> if elm is each object
[23:59:58] <symfonius> how do I specify "key_number_1" ?
