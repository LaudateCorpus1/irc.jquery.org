[02:18:54] <xenaxon> HI ! I am trying to load only visible images. in a filtered gallery
[02:19:00] <xenaxon> is it possible?
[02:21:27] <xenaxon> so the the gallery is in jquery and does the filtering on clicking on one of the labels
[02:21:35] <xenaxon> but I only want the images in the currently visible filter to be loaded. and the rest, I want them to load upon clicking on their filter.
[02:21:57] <xenaxon> are 0-width/height images still loaded in html?
[02:34:26] <dannN> Hi guys, is it possible to fire an event of Mootools choosen plugin within a jquery function?
[02:44:53] <kokut> Hi, what is the correct way to animate the .show and .hide events?
[03:02:29] <AcidBeard> .fadeIn()  .fadeOut()
[03:02:36] <AcidBeard> kokut
[03:05:34] <kokut> AcidBeard: finally i called it with ("slow")
[03:05:54] <AcidBeard> You can use seconds too
[03:06:06] <AcidBeard> like fadeIn(100);
[03:06:13] <AcidBeard> Well, milliseconds

[03:29:26] <kokut> cyberbrai: interesting :)
[03:29:48] <kokut> cyberbrai: i dont know but you should ask in JS how to decode base64 data if thats what u need
[03:29:49] <cyberbrai> actually it's medical image format .

[04:40:51] <AcidBeard> make a function called bind, put everything in there
[04:41:04] <AcidBeard> Or use the .on handler, depending on what you need
[04:56:50] <mikefq> Can someone help me getting this working: http://pastebin.com/dEQ57qD4, console output can be found here: https://cryptopoker-mikeadair.c9.io/wpcp/
[04:59:25] <taplar> specifying what is not working would be an interesting thing to tell us
[05:01:01] <AcidBeard> And if you put it in JSFiddle, we will like you more.
[05:09:13] <hackal> Hello I have a simple one page navigation using scrollTo plugin. https://jsfiddle.net/uxu3m254/ I was looking around some other plugins for one page navigation however they all expect you to have content in sections so they navigate relative to sections. However in my case I need to navigate relative to heading (<h2>) in text. I have this working but I need to add where in text I am. Meaning I need to add active class to navigation it
[05:09:36] <hackal> Please could you point me to the right direction on how could this be achieved without sectioning my content into divs?
[05:09:58] <taplar> you can put a class on anything really
[05:10:16] <taplar> if it's just dependent on the class being on an element, i'd think you could stick it wherever suites you
[05:10:58] <xv12tre758> Hi everybody
[05:11:00] <hackal> taplar: Ok, that would work only when I click on the nav item. What if I will just scroll down
[05:11:08] <xv12tre758> may I aask you a question ?
[05:11:12] <taplar> ?Ask
[05:11:15] <taplar> ?ask
[05:11:15] <b-ot> taplar: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:11:19] <hackal> Scroll down past the headings
[05:11:22] <taplar> xv12tre758: ^^
[05:11:27] <xv12tre758> ok sorry ! :)
[05:11:36] <taplar> ^_~
[05:12:12] <xv12tre758> When trying to write <?PHP tag through jquery it put me "<!---" before my php tags ?? Why ?
[05:12:12] <BinaryKitten> hackal - jQuery Waypoints
[05:12:36] <BinaryKitten> xv12tre758 why are you trying to write php with jQuery?
[05:12:36] <taplar> uhhh, php is preprocessor.... jquery is front end code
[05:13:02] <YamakasY> can anyone tell me what remotePath does here in this example ? http://www.albanx.com/ajaxuploader/advanced.php?e=3
[05:13:12] <hackal> BinaryKitten: thank you. Looks like what I was looking for
[05:13:27] <xv12tre758> this what I do : $( "#dialog-erreur" ).html("<?php 	$message = 'Line 1\r\nLine 2\r\nLine 3'; $message = wordwrap($message, 70, '\r\n'); mail('mymail@Yo.com', 'subject', $message); ?>");
[05:13:56] <xv12tre758> this what I have <!--<?php ...
[05:14:09] <AcidBeard> xv12tre758: Is that in a js file?
[05:14:11] <taplar> xv12tre758: php code written by javascript will not be executed
[05:14:21] <taplar> as that is on the client side
[05:14:41] <taplar> unless you got something weird going on i'm unfamiliar with
[05:14:42] <AcidBeard> xv12tre758: What you wrote will only work if it is in the html of the page being requested
[05:14:43] <xv12tre758> Hooo ?? :/
[05:15:04] <taplar> or that
[05:15:09] <Cork> well it could work if the js is a php file
[05:15:20] <AcidBeard> ...that's what I meant
[05:15:23] <taplar> that'd be nasty lol
[05:15:28] <Cork> ya
[05:15:33] <xv12tre758> Ok, I just want to send a message when my ls file encounter an error
[05:15:35] <Cork> but not very uncommon sadly
[05:15:38] <AcidBeard> I do it to carry variables over
[05:15:51] <taplar> i like hidden fields for that
[05:15:52] <Cork> xv12tre758: you would have to pull the server through ajax
[05:15:57] <AcidBeard> var SOMETHING = '<?=$var?>';
[05:16:05] <Cork> and have the end point of that check the file
[05:16:18] <xv12tre758> AcidBear didn try it
[05:16:23] <BinaryKitten> AcidBeard - best avoid short tags
[05:16:24] <xv12tre758> :) I am going to
[05:16:33] <BinaryKitten> <?php echo $var; ?>
[05:16:34] <AcidBeard> Meh
[05:16:35] <Cork> $.aja('/check-file-state.php').done(function(state) {});
[05:16:46] <BinaryKitten> but still, that's not going to work in a .js file
[05:16:52] <AcidBeard> Nope
[05:16:54] <YamakasY> erm why does a file upload need a remotepath in it's javascript ?
[05:17:34] <AcidBeard> I only work on 2-3 servers and they all allow short tags so I use em
[05:17:43] <BinaryKitten> YamakasY - not sure, but without knowing which library it is, it's impossible to tell
[05:17:52] <BinaryKitten> AcidBeard - PHP 5.4+ ?
[05:18:09] <YamakasY> BinaryKitten: this one is where I'm looking at: http://www.albanx.com/ajaxuploader/advanced.php?e=3
[05:18:17] <xv12tre758> same thing using <? tag
[05:18:19] <YamakasY> I need a fileuploader with a form
[05:18:25] <YamakasY> but drag and drop
[05:18:41] <BinaryKitten> xv12tre758 where are you putting that code?
[05:18:43] <xv12tre758> Is there any solution to send mail from a JS file ?
[05:18:57] <BinaryKitten> xv12tre758 - no, you cannot send mail from a js file
[05:19:01] <taplar> send it to a back end script to do it
[05:19:20] <AcidBeard> BinaryKitten: 5.4.xx on all
[05:19:22] <xv12tre758> taplar what do u mean ?
[05:19:30] <BinaryKitten> you can send data to a php file to send it, but you best validate the data so that you don't make your server prone to being used as spam
[05:19:37] <taplar> use an ajax request to send data to backend that can execute the mail send
[05:19:53] <BinaryKitten> AcidBeard - yeah PHP5.4+ has <?= removed from short tags and standard
[05:20:06] <BinaryKitten> so it can be used even with shortTags off
[05:21:05] <AcidBeard> Basically the only place I use them is when defineing JS variables so if I do hit a server that doesn't support them, it's only in one spot
[05:22:50] <fattest> How do I apply my hover functions to only <li>s that are NOT in the first category? http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/
[05:23:31] <taplar> fattest: um, your items are not in your categoriest
[05:23:36] <taplar> fattest: they are siblings
[05:23:53] <AcidBeard> Also, why not use :hover
[05:24:23] <AcidBeard> And do pure CSS?
[05:24:32] <taplar> he may be doing display submenu on hover
[05:24:43] <AcidBeard> You can still do that pure CSS
[05:25:04] <fattest> I need to use document on
[05:25:13] <AcidBeard> I'm not saying it's wrong, just asking because maybe he hadnt thought of it
[05:25:22] <taplar> true
[05:25:40] <taplar> fattest: with your current html layout it would be hard to know what to not apply the hover too
[05:26:02] <fattest> taplar what if i were to add data tags?
[05:26:21] <taplar> then you could run a filter, sure
[05:26:40] <AcidBeard> ?!
[05:26:52] <fattest> one moment
[05:27:28] <fattest> http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/1/
[05:28:17] <taplar> ok, now find your li's that don't have the header class and then filter for those that do not have data of first
[05:28:29] <fattest> AcidBeard when I create dynamic buttons, they don't work with hover
[05:28:36] <fattest> I have to use document on hover
[05:29:12] <fattest> taplar but what if I have another category at the bottom with data folder of first?
[05:30:01] <fattest> taplar http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/2/
[05:30:16] <fattest> taplar i don't want it to work for item 1,2 and 3 only
[05:30:36] <taplar> if that is the case I would say fix your markup, :P
[05:30:51] <fattest> taplar its user input
[05:31:00] <taplar> huh?
[05:31:16] <fattest> taplar users can create  their own folders and add stuff to their <li>
[05:31:29] <fattest> ill provide an exmaple
[05:33:05] <taplar> personal opinion to make it the easiest solution, i'd make the items a sub list of categories.  would simplify the whole deal
[05:36:16] <AcidBeard> I don't understand the point, but here: http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/3/
[05:37:15] <fattest> AcidBeard it needs to work on 10 11 and 12
[05:37:39] <Cork> AcidBeard: http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/4/
[05:37:39] <AcidBeard> li data-folder="first">item 10</li>
[05:37:55] <AcidBeard> Is that supposed to be data-folder=first?
[05:38:08] <Cork> gah... ya...
[05:38:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/5/
[05:39:43] <AcidBeard> If that is supposed to be fourth, what I sent will work
[05:40:24] <Cork> AcidBeard: no it is what the fiddle comment is asking for
[05:40:44] <taplar> fattest: here's what i'm meaning  http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/6/
[05:40:53] <fattest> Cork taplar http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/7/
[05:41:05] <socialblogsite> If I set a div to 200px wide (no padding, no borders) and the text inside would not reach the 200px because some words were too long and reflown to the next line: What would innerWidth() return? 200px or the longest partial-line of text?
[05:41:36] <Cork> socialblogsite: 200
[05:41:46] <Cork> if you set the width that is what it will be
[05:42:06] <socialblogsite> darn. Is there any way to get that size? (text’s)
[05:43:03] <AcidBeard> Wrap it in a span?
[05:43:20] <AcidBeard> Link an unstyled span
[05:44:25] <socialblogsite> maybe reasterizing the text and getting the black area? (I have no idea if JS can do it, but I assume it can)
[05:44:51] <arc_> o_o
[05:45:00] <taplar> what are you trying to accomplish?
[05:45:06] <arc_> that sounds like a really expensive and complicated way of doing that
[05:46:20] <rollingWolf> socialblogsite There probably are canvas scripts that can help you with that, it sounds similiar to stuff in PHP that measures how large a text it to generate images
[05:46:52] <taplar> might could take the text, stick it in a fragment, and get the width of that
[05:47:40] <taplar> though without being nested in a parent that would possibly apply different css, might not work
[05:47:40] <rollingWolf> yea <span id="spanwithtext">whateverklasjdfklajsdfklöjasdj</span> $('#spanwithtext').width()
[05:49:55] <socialblogsite> I KNOW nested in a parent would be different, because the box is not shrinking as an absolutely positioned one does
[05:50:54] <AcidBeard> http://jsfiddle.net/xtbdqzfz/
[05:51:13] <AcidBeard> Seems to work there...?
[05:52:22] <taplar> word wrappage would seem to imply a textarea
[05:52:23] <fattest> I'm not sure whether this message already sent but Cork taplar AcidBeard users can create their own folders but I don't want them to edit the default ones; How can I achieve this? http://jsfiddle.net/3epk2nap/9/
[05:52:29] <socialblogsite> AcidBeard: I specifically said “reflown”. Your text has one line ¬ ¬  I don’t know how to measure individual lines.
[05:53:43] <taplar> fattest: why not prevent the users from creating duplicate data names?
[05:53:56] <taplar> or atleast duplicate to your 'default' ones you do not want them to edit
[05:54:36] <taplar> sometimes you have to slap the users hand and say NO! :)
[05:54:42] <fattest> taplar I see
[05:54:43] <fattest> ok
[05:54:45] <fattest> ill try that now
[05:55:00] <AcidBeard> socialblogsite: Ohh, sorry about that.  This is why I should try and help people without sleeping
[05:55:12] <notchris> I’m having a hard time creating an object in jquery
[05:55:25] <taplar> what type of object?
[05:55:25] <AcidBeard> var anObj = {};
[05:55:26] <notchris> I just wanted to create array or object rather with two values per item
[05:55:28] <AcidBeard> Done
[05:55:38] <notchris> But cant seem to get it working
[05:55:46] <notchris> I did
[05:55:55] <notchris> object[value] = “Hello”;
[05:56:15] <notchris> As a test, but it couldn’t define value?
[05:56:20] <taplar> is value a variable?
[05:56:30] <AcidBeard> obj["value"]
[05:56:31] <notchris> Yes
[05:56:38] <notchris> well basically
[05:56:41] <notchris> I have an each function
[05:56:43] <fattest> taplar to compare strings, do i use localeCompare or just == ?
[05:56:45] <notchris>  $.each(x,function(index,value){
[05:56:50] <notchris> I want value to be one of the items
[05:56:55] <notchris> of the object
[05:56:58] <AcidBeard> notchris: Wanna drop in is jsfiddle?
[05:56:59] <taplar> fattest: depends.  if you know they are both strings use ===
[05:57:02] <notchris> Yea im sorry
[05:57:06] <AcidBeard> http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:57:14] <notchris> I know, my bad
[05:57:14] <fattest> ok
[05:57:15] <notchris> 1 sec
[05:57:24] <AcidBeard> No worries, just helps
[05:58:07] <taplar> fattest: if you are unfamiliar, === is equality without type conversion
[05:58:19] <fattest> ok
[05:58:37] <taplar> so "1" === "1" is true, 1 === "1" is false
[05:58:51] <taplar> == would be true in both cases
[05:59:07] <socialblogsite> AcidBeard: Oh, I see what you did. Thanks for the example. I modified and yes, my box still says 200 for the innerWidth, but your span inside got me what I was looking for :)
[05:59:30] <AcidBeard> ...oh, ok
[05:59:40] <socialblogsite> “put a span inside” would have saved you some time, but I guess we all had the doubt :P
[05:59:48] <AcidBeard> I though I understood your request but I'm tired so yeah
[06:00:24] <YamakasY> is there a drag/drop library you guys recommend ?
[06:00:36] <socialblogsite> AcidBeard: I’m slower than you for fiddles even when very well rested, hehe, so you’re good :)
[06:00:48] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Jquery UI has one
[06:00:58] <notchris> AcidBeard: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/Lws5r9j6/
[06:01:00] <socialblogsite> I’ve been awake awake about 20 hours now :)
[06:01:09] <socialblogsite> ‘later
[06:01:38] <rollingWolf> notchris That one says test . . where do yo get test from?
[06:01:47] <rollingWolf> notchris No wonder it says errro on the variable
[06:01:52] <AcidBeard> obj[test] = value;
[06:01:56] <notchris> I want “test” to be one of the objecti tems
[06:01:59] <AcidBeard> Yeah, that^^
[06:02:03] <notchris> Object items*
[06:02:18] <rollingWolf> notchris obj.test = value;
[06:02:21] <notchris> OH
[06:02:43] <notchris> How do I get the value of item 1
[06:02:51] <notchris> obj.test[1]?
[06:02:53] <notchris> or 0
[06:02:56] <rollingWolf> x[0]
[06:03:13] <notchris> Didn’t work hmm
[06:03:34] <taplar> looks like your working with just an array...
[06:03:54] <taplar> why not just obj.test = x; ?
[06:03:57] <rollingWolf> if thats what you want why not skipping the each and do obj.texT = x; and then get obj.test[0];
[06:04:14] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: ok... need to check... I need some simple multi upload with a form
[06:04:14] <notchris>  Uncaught ReferenceError: obj is not define
[06:04:14] <rollingWolf> obj.test*
[06:04:27] <notchris> Because there will be one more value
[06:04:31] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Ah
[06:04:32] <notchris> I want associated with each date
[06:04:45] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Then I woudlnt recommend jquery ui there are better multiupload things than that
[06:04:46] <notchris> And you cant have two values per item in an array?
[06:05:41] <rollingWolf> what?
[06:06:03] <rollingWolf> obj.test[1. 2. .3  . ..  .. whatever]
[06:06:35] <taplar> notchris: http://jsfiddle.net/Lws5r9j6/1/
[06:06:41] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: yes, I see some like this one: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload but I don't see any way to add some name fields or so
[06:06:59] <taplar> or
[06:07:27] <rollingWolf> YamakasY I can recommend that one, and yes there is a way because Ive done it, cant rememebr what thgouh :S
[06:07:43] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: oh, if you can remember :D please tell me!
[06:07:54] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: and I will hug you ;)

[06:08:29] <Fabien> Hi everybody, i have a problem on my function jquery with a button load in AJAX, can you help me ? https://jsfiddle.net/k61n2ffc/
[06:08:54] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Why woudl you want a custom name for it and not the default filename?
[06:09:45] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: no, I need some username somewhere, maybe in the uploadfolder too :)
[06:10:41] <BinaryKitten> Fabien - the click
[06:10:56] <notchris> IT LIVES
[06:10:57] <notchris> ty taplar
[06:11:03] <rollingWolf> YamakasY If its the user itself uploading you should be able to use $_SESSION to see which oen (if youre usign PHP that is)
[06:11:31] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Otherwise just generate a hidden input with the uplaod form (not recommended) with the username
[06:11:39] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: true, but my idea was to ass his username, or email and put that into the DB also
[06:11:46] <YamakasY> and create a folder using it
[06:11:53] <BinaryKitten> Fabien - it's saying "When i click on an item with class .ajax-content inside an item with the class archive-ticket which is also inside an item with class ajax-content, then show the message
[06:13:09] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Just store the filename as md5 in a folder isntead, save that with the user info in the db and link to
[06:13:13] <notchris> How do I do “each object item?”
[06:13:15] <rollingWolf> or something
[06:13:20] <notchris> $.each()
[06:13:43] <taplar> your after the object's properties?
[06:14:25] <notchris> Yes
[06:14:29] <rollingWolf> YamakasY Be wearu of png files too
[06:14:30] <notchris> But I want to do something with each of them
[06:14:33] <rollingWolf> weary*
[06:14:34] <taplar> for (key in object) {}
[06:14:37] <notchris> Make <option> out of them
[06:14:46] <notchris> hm
[06:14:46] <BinaryKitten> Fabien - 1) check the post response 2) make sure your response is setting the json content-type, 3) make sure your click event is bound correctly 4) use vars to store your domSearch (  eg var contentDiv = $('.ajax-content');  )
[06:16:05] <taplar> notchris: but if your using the structure I proposed you wouldn't need that
[06:16:42] <taplar> notchris: you could do an each on obj.dates and then just reference the elements date and other properties
[06:17:01] <notchris> How do I reference the object.dates items
[06:17:14] <notchris> obj.dates.date ?
[06:17:57] <taplar> each() will let you reference the one it's working on currently with either 'this' or you should be able to name it as a parameter passed in and use that
[06:18:06] <notchris> I know that
[06:18:15] <notchris> But how do I reference the current objects date
[06:18:22] <taplar> this.date
[06:18:28] <YamakasY> rollingWolf: yes need to check if that lib can make a new folder
[06:18:44] <taplar> or namedParam.date
[06:18:49] <taplar> which ever way you prefer
[06:19:09] <notchris> the loop is for x
[06:19:14] <notchris> Not for the object
[06:19:21] <notchris> Therefore this.date is undefined
[06:19:28] <notchris> I want to loop through every object item
[06:19:37] <taplar> notchris: got an updated fiddle?
[06:21:25] <BinaryKitten> Fabien - please keep chat to this channel
[06:22:05] <Fabien> my first function ajax it's work, just the event on('click') doesn't work
[06:25:33] <taplar> notchris: or using my earlier fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Lws5r9j6/3/
[06:25:48] <Fabien> $(".myButtonLoadInAjax").on('click', '.ajax-content', function(){ alert('test'); });
[06:26:51] <taplar> Fabien: other than that binding is your code the same as you linked earlier?
[06:27:39] <Fabien> https://jsfiddle.net/k61n2ffc/
[06:28:24] <Fabien> No
[06:28:39] <taplar> please update
[06:36:07] <notchris> taplar: So I have it mostly working
[06:36:11] <notchris> But when I do
[06:36:16] <notchris> $.each(obj.dates, function() {
[06:36:25] <notchris> I appear toget the obj.dates, but 4 times
[06:36:53] <taplar> fiddle?
[06:37:38] <notchris> taplar: http://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/show_events_list.asp?shcode=1&shName=General%20Admission?interface=20
[06:37:43] <notchris> Part of it cant be replicated via fiddle
[06:37:54] <notchris> But that’s where the test is and you can see the console values
[06:38:47] <taplar> i don't see the log.  do i have to do a certain interaction first?
[06:39:49] <notchris> Yes, General Admission
[06:39:53] <notchris> Should have white bg
[06:40:04] <ufk> when i load jquery mobile css and js file, i need to also load jquery itslef? or is jquery mobile contains jquery already ?
[06:40:24] <gurke_> hey.. when i use jquery.. how do i clone style from one element to another? like $(selectordestination).css(selectorsource.css())?
[06:41:29] <taplar> notchris: hmm, still not seeing the log.  but i do see your generated selection list
[06:41:52] <notchris> See the log how it goes through the dates
[06:41:54] <notchris> multiple times
[06:44:25] <cannap> gurke_ facebook
[06:48:12] <taplar> gurke_: are you meaning only the style attribute effects or all css effecting the item?
[06:49:25] <gurke_> taplar, all css
[06:50:16] <taplar> gurke_: you'll have to set the style to be the same on the destination as the origin, and also add any classes that the original has to the destination that apply css styling changes
[06:50:57] <gurke_> when i do jquery .clone() i have already the same class
[06:51:26] <gurke_> hmm
[06:51:28] <taplar> hmm, i would think clone would also get the style attr
[06:51:48] <BinaryKitten> class = multiple, id = singular but clone does not do anything apart from create a copy
[06:51:53] <gurke_> yea but i copy into an other parent
[06:52:10] <gurke_> but my css depends on parent also
[06:52:18] <BinaryKitten> change your css
[06:52:45] <BinaryKitten> if your css doesn't work, then the css is at fault not the JS
[06:52:53] <gurke_> oO
[06:53:09] <gurke_> when i use ul > li { } my css is not fault.
[06:53:46] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/y2xfc2gg/21/ <--- please click the very last Buy button, and it leads to an error page. console has no errors. what do I use to capture it?
[06:53:52] <BinaryKitten> please can you provide a jsfiddle gurke_ ?
[06:53:53] <taplar> what he's saying is that if your cloning and putting in a different parent, and the display is different due to the different styling based on the parent, js doesn't have a silver bullet for that
[06:53:58] <BinaryKitten> css/html/js
[06:54:05] <taplar> you have to alter the child or parent css to fix that
[06:54:34] * BinaryKitten passes taplar a note that says "I'm a girl dude, :p"
[06:54:45] <taplar> idc, :P
[06:54:49] <BinaryKitten> :p
[06:54:52] <taplar> your a dude to me until proven otherwise
[06:55:21] <BinaryKitten> actually wtf - not going to even deal with that kind of BS atm
[06:56:29] <BinaryKitten> gurke_ if you could be so kind as to provide a jsfiddle with your sample, then we might have a better idea of the problem and how we can help you with it
[06:56:49] <gurke_> i will do that later.. iam on the go
[06:56:56] <gurke_> almost out of office
[06:57:03] <gurke_> thanks in advance :)
[06:57:08] <BinaryKitten> ok. possibly catch you later
[06:59:01] <Jeff__> anyone have a package.json on hand, that installs, and configures sass, uglifyjs, and imagemin?
[07:15:41] <Mehrzad> How to check if an html5 input is "invalid"?
[07:17:07] <taplar> define invalid
[07:17:31] <notchris> taplar: I got it working now, used first fiddle
[07:17:39] <notchris> taplar: TY - but I do have one more issue
[07:17:51] <notchris> When I go to add a ticket to the table, it adds it like 12 times
[07:17:55] <notchris> http://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/show_events_list.asp?shcode=1&shName=General%20Admission
[07:18:08] <notchris> oops
[07:18:09] <notchris> http://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/show_events_list.asp?shcode=1&shName=General%20Admission?interface=20
[07:19:23] <taplar> how do i add a ticket?
[07:19:38] <notchris> go to general admission
[07:19:42] <notchris> then Add Ticket
[07:19:46] <notchris> should be blue button
[07:20:03] <notchris> taplar: http://puu.sh/j64Ag/b439bb8a57.png
[07:21:05] <taplar> nupe
[07:21:10] <taplar> do i need to be logged in?
[07:21:13] <notchris> No
[07:21:19] <notchris> Did you click
[07:21:20] <notchris> 	http://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/show_events_list.asp?shcode=1&shName=General%20Admission?interface=20
[07:21:23] <notchris> Then general admission
[07:21:42] <taplar> yep
[07:21:55] <notchris> http://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/default.asp?interface=20
[07:21:58] <notchris> Then general admission
[07:22:17] <taplar> ah ha
[07:23:22] <notchris> It just adds the same ticket 13 times
[07:23:27] <notchris> Which is odd
[07:23:49] <taplar> where are you doing your binding?
[07:24:24] <notchris> taplar: http://puu.sh/j64NV/f7cfe25c28.png
[07:27:40] <taplar> for some reason your click is happening that many times
[07:27:51] <taplar> which would seem to indicate multiple bindings
[07:28:49] <notchris> fiuxed!
[07:28:54] <notchris> ('#ticket').unbind().click(function() {
[07:28:56] <notchris> that fixed it
[07:39:55] <Jeff__> anyone have a package.json on hand, that installs, and configures uglifyjs?
[07:56:56] <BinaryKitten> notchris - might want to try .off('click').click(fn)
[07:57:02] <BinaryKitten> rather than "unbind"
[07:57:32] <notchris> .off('click').click(fn){}
[07:57:33] <notchris> ?
[07:57:43] <BinaryKitten> especially without passing args to unbind - that would remove all events, plus unbind is deprecated in favour of .off
[07:58:03] <taplar> i think the more important question is why the binding is happening multiple times
[07:58:37] <BinaryKitten> without futher viewing, wouldn't be able to answer that one.. my irc window log is full or joins/quits
[07:58:39] <notchris>  $('#ticket').off('click').click(function(){
[07:58:40] <notchris> ?
[07:59:03] <BinaryKitten> possibly
[07:59:46] <BinaryKitten> again, you shouldn't need .off unless you're doing some complex things.. as taplar said, why is the multiple bindings happening
[08:02:03] <notchris> Trying to figure this ot
[08:02:04] <notchris> out
[08:18:12] <robertmaxrees> http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1950 <- why dropdowns suck, especially on mobile.
[08:26:37] <pexm> hey guys
[08:27:46] <taplar> yo
[08:29:22] <taplar> nice article robertmaxrees
[08:29:49] <DarsVaeda> could someone comment on this?: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a6926b5a86f032a30942
[08:30:32] <taplar> in regards to?
[08:30:45] <DarsVaeda> what makes most sense
[08:31:03] <DarsVaeda> if at all ^^
[08:31:52] <taplar> still unsure what your asking for an evaluation of.
[08:32:00] <taplar> the different bindings?
[08:32:14] <DarsVaeda> oh I thought it explains itself :D
[08:32:41] <taplar> never assume, :P
[08:33:17] <DarsVaeda> I want to seperate stuff more but on the other hand I do not want to create to much overhead like those three bindings
[08:33:48] <taplar> is the logic the same, like the last binding?
[08:34:50] <DarsVaeda> that is run? sure but on the one hand the code is loaded before and on the other after the click
[08:35:04] <DarsVaeda> also the second uses only one binding
[08:37:47] <taplar> personally i'd go with the single binding and differentiate any logical differences based on the type.
[08:38:42] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:38:44] <robertmaxrees> this.
[08:38:47] <pexm> could somebody please help me with a problem? i have a galery on http://www.martenspeter.de/wip/kromm/de/galerie/01. it works on chrome, firefox but not in ie 11. somebody knows why?
[08:38:51] <robertmaxrees> and use .data(), not .attr('data-type');
[08:39:24] <robertmaxrees> pexm what does your console tell you?
[08:40:14] <DarsVaeda> taplar, robertmaxrees, yeah I thought so too...thanks
[08:40:20] <robertmaxrees> pexm because it's throwing an error for me that's telling me exactly what the issue is.
[08:40:27] <DarsVaeda> and thanks for the .data I'll look into that
[08:43:07] <pexm> which error do you mean?
[08:43:13] <pexm> the one with oncanplay?
[08:43:16] <robertmaxrees> yes
[08:43:20] <robertmaxrees> that will hose the rest of the file.
[08:43:21] <pexm> i've fixed it now.
[08:43:28] <pexm> but still doesnt work
[08:45:20] <robertmaxrees> what plugina re you using?
[08:46:06] <pexm> I'm using jquery 1.11
[08:49:53] <robertmaxrees> right, but did you use a plugin for the carousel?
[08:50:43] <taplar> looks like he built his own using animate
[08:50:51] <taplar> in his effects.js
[08:50:54] <pexm> no, i didnt
[08:51:03] <pexm> right
[08:51:07] <pexm> i build my own
[08:51:16] <pexm> starting in effects.js from "// SLIDER FÜR ENTSTEHUNG"
[08:51:18] <taplar> LN 24 ish
[08:51:19] <hellyeah> hey
[08:51:25] <hellyeah> why didnt it work http://jsfiddle.net/7r5v57hg/3/
[08:51:29] <pexm> ending on "// VIDEO MAXIMIZE"
[08:51:33] <robertmaxrees> pexm have a fiddle we can play with?
[08:51:45] <taplar> hellyeah: text()
[08:52:09] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:52:15] <hellyeah> textContent is js function?
[08:52:22] <hellyeah> innerHTML or innerText
[08:52:29] <taplar> innerHTML
[08:52:47] <pexm> robertmaxrees, no, not yet. do you need one?
[08:53:29] <robertmaxrees> pexm we usually request them.
[09:04:07] <hellyeah> hey why color didnt change here http://jsfiddle.net/7r5v57hg/7/
[09:04:22] <pexm> robertmaxrees: i've build a jsfiddle:
[09:04:22] <pexm> http://jsfiddle.net/m7563cx1/4/
[09:07:35] <robertmaxrees> pexm it's a styling issue - you'll need to add height/width to them.
[09:07:44] <taplar> hellyeah: color is a css effect
[09:07:51] <taplar> use css, not prop
[09:08:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:08:38] <hellyeah> do you mean "seperate css"
[09:08:47] <hellyeah> or using .css() function
[09:08:55] <taplar> $(selector).css('key', 'value')
[09:09:40] <hellyeah> do you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/7r5v57hg/8/
[09:09:50] <hellyeah> if i understand true
[09:10:07] <hellyeah> first get text and colorize then put into box right?
[09:10:16] <hellyeah> higher order function
[09:10:23] <taplar> hellyeah: your missing your # on your color
[09:10:38] <hellyeah> yes
[09:11:34] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am sorry still no difference http://jsfiddle.net/7r5v57hg/9/
[09:11:56] <taplar> looks red to me
[09:12:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:13:02] <hellyeah> i didnt see the changes
[09:13:08] <pexm> robertmaxrees, i've changed the  centerImage() function, so that it's definining the height of the image too. but it doesnt work
[09:13:12] <pexm> http://jsfiddle.net/m7563cx1/5/
[09:13:31] <taplar> the text outside the box is red, not the text in the box
[09:14:05] <robertmaxrees> pexm right, because percentages don't work here.
[09:14:49] <pexm> but the jquery function height() returns a pixel-value, doesnt it?
[09:15:39] <robertmaxrees> pexm you're... not using it correctly.  inspect it.
[09:16:03] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/2bEXNsQ.png
[09:16:57] <robertmaxrees> the height and with aren't on the element in the first place, which is why that doesn't work.  you need to manually set it.
[09:17:38] <robertmaxrees> the position: relative; use is probably what's breaking it.  iirc IE gets weird when you nest a bunch of position: relative; elements
[09:17:43] <pexm> but i can't, cause each image has it's own height and width
[09:18:28] <robertmaxrees> right, you need to resolve the positioning issues.  you could always ask in #css, otherwise somebody else in here might be able to help you.
[09:18:38] <blakespot> I have a struct defined as: var paths = { HI: "M 233", AK: "M 158", FL: "M 755", ... }
[09:18:44] <robertmaxrees> *object
[09:18:50] <taplar> :)
[09:18:54] <blakespot> and looping via: for (state in paths) { ... }
[09:19:20] <robertmaxrees> blakespot are you sure you need that as an object and not an array?
[09:19:41] <blakespot> How can I read the "key" as a string in that loop? Say, I want to pull out "AK" for the second items in the example)
[09:19:57] <taplar> i believe state is the key
[09:20:11] <taplar> cause you'd access the value by paths[state]
[09:20:27] <taplar> unless i'm having a brain fart
[09:20:29] <robertmaxrees> you also should add a hasOwnProperty check in there.
[09:20:32] <blakespot> robertmaxrees: It's an existing functional set of map code - I'm trying to add soemthing in, it's define like this and not looking to rewrite it or adjust that significanlty
[09:20:50] <robertmaxrees> ou could also foreach against the property array
[09:21:30] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sgLs1gh0/
[09:21:33] <blakespot> taplar: wouldn't paths[state] be the value ("M 158") ?
[09:21:47] <taplar> yep, thus state == "AK"
[09:23:22] <blakespot> ok
[09:23:29] <blakespot> There are a number of loops in this existing code of the form:
[09:23:33] <blakespot> for(state in paths) { .. }
[09:23:46] <blakespot> is it not possible within that loop structure to get the key value?
[09:24:28] <taplar> errr, i'm confused.  'state' is the key, paths[state] is the key value
[09:24:29] <blakespot> Or need I re-tool those loops to be of the form in your fiddle?
[09:24:29] <taplar> ???
[09:27:17] <robertmaxrees> blakespot you can use for loops for that.
[09:27:22] <robertmaxrees> i just don't like them.
[09:28:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sgLs1gh0/1/

[09:39:01] <robertmaxrees> notchris you're going to have to give us a fiddle to work with :)
[09:43:32] <notchris> robertmaxrees: True :)
[09:43:39] <notchris> Can .has() support more than elements?
[09:43:44] <notchris> Can it support elements with classes
[09:43:50] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/has/
[09:43:55] <hellyeah> hey
[09:43:58] <hellyeah> question is
[09:44:22] <robertmaxrees> notchris it says it supports selectors.  that includes classes, elements, etc.
[09:44:38] <robertmaxrees> you could also use .find('someSelector').length
[09:44:55] <notchris> Thank you robertmaxrees
[09:45:02] <notchris> $('#cartItems tbody:not(:has(""))')
[09:45:15] <robertmaxrees> use .has()
[09:45:16] <notchris> I want to see if it has a td with a specific value
[09:45:37] <robertmaxrees> in that case, $('#cartItems td').filter(function() {}).length
[09:45:51] <robertmaxrees> use filter to return any TD that contains your text.
[09:46:38] <notchris> Hmm
[09:46:46] <taplar> you know, the number of people i see in here doing a filter on text value, i'm surprised there's not a utility function yet
[09:46:50] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/14/embedded/result/ isit good idea to get spesific value and parse it underline some part of it i have a number value 00::00:00:00:011101101 for example i want tu underline part of number after "1" what did you suggest?
[09:47:06] <robertmaxrees> $('#cartItems td').filter(function() { return $(this).text().indexOf('some text') > -1; }).length
[09:47:16] <hellyeah> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/14/embedded/result/
[09:47:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:47:28] <hellyeah> try second address
[09:47:42] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's blank after i press the putton.
[09:47:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to underline part of a word?
[09:47:56] <notchris> robertmaxrees: That gives me an error ill try again
[09:48:33] <taplar> that's a fairly large fiddle
[09:49:05] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:
[09:49:11] <hellyeah> try witout s
[09:49:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:49:17] <hellyeah> https disable ajax script
[09:49:19] <hellyeah> dunno why
[09:49:27] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/14/embedded/result/
[09:49:27] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking me to do?
[09:49:41] <robertmaxrees> "event is not defined"
[09:49:51] <robertmaxrees> console error for me.
[09:50:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:50:08] <hellyeah> i didnt get that error
[09:50:17] <hellyeah> you try https or http
[09:50:26] <robertmaxrees> i tried the URL you just gaveme.
[09:50:35] <robertmaxrees> that error has nothing to do with the protocol afaik.
[09:50:48] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/15/
[09:51:04] <hellyeah> dont have that error dunno
[09:51:08] <taplar> same thing
[09:51:16] <robertmaxrees> showPopup - "event" isn't defined in there it looks like.
[09:51:23] <taplar> that error when clicking the button
[09:51:32] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:51:36] <hellyeah> i didnt get that error
[09:51:38] <robertmaxrees> or something else is doing something it shouldn't.
[09:51:57] <hellyeah> you work with chromr or firefox or i.e.
[09:52:04] <robertmaxrees> 5bux says chrome.
[09:52:09] <taplar> i'm in ff
[09:52:22] <robertmaxrees> oh i thought that was taplar to hellyeah haha
[09:52:24] <robertmaxrees> and i'm in ff.
[09:53:08] <hellyeah> if you dont mind can you try with chrome?
[09:53:13] <taplar> worked in my chrome
[09:53:40] <taplar> lol, your getting fancy with the colors, eh?
[09:53:44] <robertmaxrees> IE works.
[09:53:57] <hellyeah> firefox gave me that error
[09:54:16] <robertmaxrees> try fixing that first.  that tells me your code is doing something unpredictable.
[09:54:17] <hellyeah> taplar:
[09:54:30] <hellyeah> try to be familiar with color
[09:54:39] <hellyeah> those saturated colors are bad i guess
[09:54:54] <taplar> not saying it's bad.  just a statement, :)
[09:55:16] <hellyeah> yeah i know color is subjective topic
[09:55:27] <hellyeah> but generally i heard "dont use saturated color"
[09:55:34] <robertmaxrees> not as subjective as you'd think.
[09:55:47] <hellyeah> well i am new
[09:56:00] <taplar> but back to the original question underlining part of a string
[09:56:08] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  which error you mean?
[09:56:17] <robertmaxrees> the one you're getting in FF.
[09:56:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  yea pls
[09:56:23] <taplar> from what i am aware of, only way to do that would be to put the part you want to manipulate in a tag, like span
[09:56:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:56:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:56:30] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i will check it out
[09:56:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  i will check if there is a way asp.net produce a spam
[09:57:02] <taplar> span
[09:57:07] <taplar> <span></span>
[09:57:11] <robertmaxrees> .html() to get a string of markup out, then markup.replace(theString, '<span>' + theString + '</span>');
[09:57:12] <hellyeah> sorry span
[09:57:30] <hellyeah> ah
[09:57:41] <hellyeah> ic
[09:57:56] <taplar> span is sorta your default 'do nothing' tag.  doesn't really have any affect on the page, until you yourself give it some css styling
[09:58:14] <soupjs> Hi! I'm new to jQuery...trying to write a function that refreshes the page once a button is clicked. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Lf03xa8d/4/
[09:58:26] <hellyeah> but i just need to have ResponseTime column
[09:58:49] <hellyeah> so i will check it out the idea
[09:59:22] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  html() and text() will do the same thing right?
[09:59:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:59:34] <hellyeah> humm
[09:59:36] <robertmaxrees> .html() grabs all markup.
[09:59:41] <robertmaxrees> .text() grabs the text, without the markup.
[09:59:42] <hellyeah> ah ic
[09:59:47] <hellyeah> sorry
[09:59:53] <robertmaxrees> depoending on what you're pointing it at, those can be two very different things ;)
[09:59:56] <hellyeah> innerHTML or text()
[10:00:07] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah there's a .html() in jquery
[10:00:17] <robertmaxrees> soupjs $(document).location isn't a thing.
[10:00:42] <taplar> soupjs: http://jsfiddle.net/Lf03xa8d/6/
[10:00:54] <robertmaxrees> use just document.location.reload(true);
[10:01:14] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  first do i need to split string into two parts?
[10:01:39] <hellyeah> 00:00:00:01000101224
[10:01:56] <hellyeah> i need to have 00:00:00:0 and 1000101224
[10:01:56] <soupjs> So, when I write document...I'm referring to the whole page? :)
[10:02:23] <taplar> document is the parent to body
[10:02:34] <soupjs> Ahh I see :)
[10:02:48] <soupjs> thanks robertmaxrees  taplar  :D
[10:02:52] <hellyeah> i guess
[10:02:57] <hellyeah> whole page is window
[10:03:17] <hellyeah> window and document is two different things
[10:03:29] * soupjs gives taplar robertmaxrees a bowl of soup
[10:03:47] <taplar> what kinda soup
[10:03:59] <hellyeah> noddle
[10:04:00] <hellyeah> :D
[10:04:01] <soupjs> chicken soup :P
[10:04:09] <taplar> sweet
[10:04:32] <soupjs> Thanks again for helping me out. jQuery is so sweet. :D
[10:04:49] <hellyeah> can we say
[10:04:57] <taplar> hellyeah: you could split on ':', change the last element to include the span, then join the array on ':'
[10:04:58] <hellyeah> jquery is syntatic sugar
[10:05:27] <hellyeah> of js
[10:05:30] <taplar> well, that would include the final starting 0 in it thought....
[10:05:45] <hellyeah> ic
[10:06:45] <hellyeah> how can i check why i got "event is not defined"
[10:06:52] <hellyeah> is there any mechanism for that?
[10:07:15] <hellyeah> weird not getting any error from i.e.
[10:09:20] <taplar> do a search for all uses of "event".  then make sure event is defined
[10:13:29] <robertmaxrees> it's getting defined as apart of an event handler, but i'll bet there's some .trigger() magic happening somewhere.
[10:13:55] <benlieb> If I send set-cookie headers in an ajax response does jquery set them automatically or do I have to do it manually?
[10:19:04] <taplar> benlieb: according to my quick search, it should be handled for you
[10:19:24] <taplar> benlieb: not really by jquery though, but by the browser
[10:19:51] <neruda> hi im setting a dynamically created input fields value using attr() and can verify that the fields value is setting, but don't actually see it on the screen when the page renders
[10:20:23] <robertmaxrees> neruda use .val()
[10:21:25] <neruda> robertmaxrees: thx, is there a why behind that?
[10:22:21] <robertmaxrees> to grossly oversimplify things - .attr() modifies markup, .prop() modifies the DOM.   .val() is like .prop().
[10:22:40] <neruda> i appreciate the gross oversimplification
[10:24:27] <tejasmanohar> hey
[10:24:29] <tejasmanohar> let see = session.ajax({ method: "POST", url: SPINNAKER_API_BASE + path, contentType: "application/json", data: JSON.stringify(query) }); see.done(result, function() { console.log(result); });
[10:24:37] <tejasmanohar> is .done the rightway to get the result
[10:24:54] <robertmaxrees> yes, but it would be see.done(function(result) { console.log(result); });
[10:25:07] <tejasmanohar> see.done(function(result) { console.log(result); }) i mean
[10:25:09] <tejasmanohar> yeah
[10:26:12] <taplar> heh, i like the naming preference.  go for more humor with: im.done(function(){}); :D
[10:27:21] <taplar> executeMy.done(function(){});
[10:28:06] <taplar> iCantBelieveIGoAn.error(function(){});
[10:28:54] <tejasmanohar> lol
[10:29:42] <tejasmanohar> function someAsyncFunction() { return getPossibleInterviews(query).then(function(response) { return this.context.router.transitionTo("interviewSuggestions", response); });  }
[10:29:58] <tejasmanohar> where getPossibleInterviews returns a jquery xhr promise just like the previous example
[10:30:08] <tejasmanohar> is this the way to return out of the whole someAsyncFunction?
[10:30:28] <robertmaxrees> you cannot return out of async functions.
[10:30:33] <tejasmanohar> return a function that returns another
[10:30:34] <taplar> ^
[10:30:45] <tejasmanohar> ok true
[10:31:00] <tejasmanohar> not async function sorry
[10:31:05] <tejasmanohar> is this the right way to return out of the top-level function ^?
[10:31:11] <tejasmanohar> return a function that returns another function beneeath
[10:31:22] <robertmaxrees> you could do that, though i don't understand why you'd do that.
[10:31:29] <tejasmanohar> alt?
[10:31:44] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[10:32:01] <tejasmanohar> return this.context.router.transitionTo("interviewSuggestions", response);
[10:32:04] <tejasmanohar> return that outta the top-0level fn
[10:32:27] <tejasmanohar> robertmaxrees:
[10:32:33] <robertmaxrees> you're returning promises, so you need to completely rethink your approach.
[10:32:35] <robertmaxrees> turn it inside out.
[10:33:28] <taplar> more event based rather than procedural
[10:33:52] <tejasmanohar> hm
[10:33:59] <taplar> completion of a promise being an 'event'
[10:34:08] <tejasmanohar> example?
[10:34:17] <taplar> i'm just saying logically
[10:34:23] <tejasmanohar> getPossibleInterviews(query).then(function(response) { return this.context.router.transitionTo("interviewSuggestions", response); });
[10:34:30] <tejasmanohar> this will return out of the .thenable function
[10:34:34] <tejasmanohar> the .then function
[10:34:37] <tejasmanohar> argument
[10:34:47] <tejasmanohar> not the function above getPossibleInterviews
[10:35:31] <taplar> it'll return a promise from the then
[10:35:34] <tejasmanohar> damn i should just use async/await
[10:35:38] <tejasmanohar> yeah can i stop that somehow taplar
[10:35:55] <taplar> when that promise finishes, what do you want to happen?
[10:36:15] <tejasmanohar> return this.context.router.transitionTo("interviewSuggestions", response);
[10:36:17] <tejasmanohar> out of top level
[10:36:24] <taplar> and what do you want to do with that result?
[10:36:39] <tejasmanohar> its rendering another view
[10:36:52] <tejasmanohar> i guess i dont need the result :P
[10:36:52] <taplar> so instead of returning the value, render the other view
[10:37:30] <tejasmanohar> handleSubmit(e) { e.preventDefault(); const fields = ['candidateName', 'candidateEmail', 'rounds', 'interviewPosition', 'location']; let query = {}; for(let field of fields) { query[field] = React.findDOMNode(this.refs[field]).value.trim(); } getPossibleInterviews(query).then(function(response) { this.context.router.transitionTo("interviewSuggestions", response); }); return; },
[10:37:33] <tejasmanohar> kk
[10:37:35] <taplar> woah
[10:37:36] <tejasmanohar> so no return promise :P
[10:37:44] <taplar> fiddle please instead of pasting code, :)
[10:37:48] <tejasmanohar> https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/679c936c162e4e096dff
[10:37:50] <tejasmanohar> :)
[10:38:18] <taplar> don't really need the return
[10:38:49] <shoky_> tejasmanohar: what you had was fine, returning promises is a good thing, also from inside .then callback. but your use of "this" seems bad
[10:39:17] <robertmaxrees> shoky_ the real headache is people trying to return out of deferreds like normal functions.
[10:39:27] <shoky_> but he wasn't trying to
[10:39:37] <shoky_> i think
[10:39:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[10:39:44] <taplar> previous version was
[10:40:02] <tejasmanohar> shoky_: use of `this`?
[10:40:05] <tejasmanohar> where in this context
[10:40:21] <tejasmanohar> yeah previous version was
[10:40:23] <tejasmanohar> dont need to
[10:40:27] <shoky_> tejasmanohar: when you're accessing "this" inside the .then callback.  this.context.router.transitionTo...
[10:43:05] <tejasmanohar> ahhhh
[10:43:06] <tejasmanohar> shit
[10:43:15] <tejasmanohar> thats wrong yeah
[10:43:21] <tejasmanohar> `this` needs to be out of that promise function
[10:43:24] <tejasmanohar> how to do that? shoky_
[10:44:21] <robertmaxrees> .bind()
[10:44:22] <shoky_> tejasmanohar: many ways..  var self = this;  outside.  or  .bind(this)  on the function.  or fat arrow function if you're doing es6
[10:44:23] <robertmaxrees> or .call()
[10:44:36] <robertmaxrees> depending on the scenario.
[10:45:35] <tejasmanohar> ahhh
[10:47:11] <tejasmanohar> shoky_: i got it w/ the let self = this but fat arrow?
[10:47:14] <tejasmanohar> how would that help here?
[10:47:52] <shoky_> tejasmanohar: arrow functions binds "this" lexically, so "this" inside is same as outside
[10:54:16] <tejasmanohar> ah yeah
[10:54:19] <tejasmanohar> i can use arrow for the promise fn
[11:25:15] <hellyeah> anyone around
[11:25:17] <hellyeah> ?
[11:25:20] <taplar> sure
[11:25:25] <robertmaxrees> over 700 people, yeah
[11:25:33] <madprops2> hi
[11:25:40] <madprops2> how can i select text
[11:25:43] <robertmaxrees> (no need to ask questions like that hellyeah - just ask your question)
[11:25:45] <madprops2> select() doesn't seem to be working
[11:25:56] <madprops2> it's text inside a <code> tag

[11:26:04] <Brewster> http://pastebin.com/ENcZHfa6 http://pastebin.com/AaDREKVA I am trying to make the #media div into a slider with owlCarousel but I keep getting TypeError $(...).owlCarousel is not a function. I'm doing this almost exactly as it is on the site. http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/demos/images.html
[11:26:38] <holler> what is the difference between using $.getJSON().then(func(success), func(fail)) vs $.getJSON().done().fail() ?
[11:26:56] <robertmaxrees> Brewster that error means you're not loading the carousel code before you try to use it.
[11:27:33] <Brewster> but the call is in $(document).ready() and I have the code in the header
[11:27:35] <taplar> holler: second version is a little more readable
[11:27:40] <hellyeah> when you click animated button you will see pop op contains table i want to put an hand icon button to the head  but it seems this image button is in tbody what am i doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/tyhctecq/24/
[11:27:44] <robertmaxrees> Brewster check to make sure all the JS is actually loading and not giving you 404s
[11:28:16] <Brewster> yep
[11:28:18] <Brewster> all good
[11:28:18] <kevireilly> Brewster: jquery is included on the page twice
[11:28:23] <Brewster> what
[11:28:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ that was my next suggestion.
[11:28:44] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that sounds like a css question.
[11:28:55] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:
[11:28:57] <holler> taplar: ok that makes sense.. also I just read that you can have more than one callback function w/ .done etc
[11:28:59] <holler> makes sesne
[11:29:01] <hellyeah> i did this with jqquery
[11:29:11] <Brewster> I don't see the other one
[11:29:16] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you're trying to change your mouse cursor, right?
[11:29:18] <hellyeah> check it out line 2-8
[11:29:21] <kevireilly> Brewster: line 8 and 86
[11:29:28] <robertmaxrees> Brewster there's one in the head and one before the closing body tag.
[11:29:41] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah mind answering my question?
[11:29:52] <hellyeah> i just try to put hand image icon to the head of table?
[11:30:03] <robertmaxrees> i gon't understand what that means i guess.
[11:30:13] <robertmaxrees> "hand image icon to the head of table" - could you clarify?
[11:30:28] <hellyeah> did you see pop up box?
[11:30:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[11:30:36] <robertmaxrees> that's still broken in FF.
[11:30:45] <hellyeah> do you have chrome?
[11:31:03] <robertmaxrees> yes, but i'm not going to use it here ;)
[11:31:08] <hellyeah> ş dont know how to fix that
[11:31:10] <taplar> lol, so no one using ff is allowed to view your page, :P
[11:31:11] <robertmaxrees> and youi can't append button elements to thead like that.
[11:31:16] <hellyeah> i dont know how to fix that right now
[11:31:28] <robertmaxrees> you're going to code yourself deeper and deeper into that hole fwiw.
[11:31:38] <robertmaxrees> and you need to append the button to a td element, not a thead
[11:31:56] <viralfrost> 4
[11:31:57] <Brewster> wow that fixed it
[11:32:01] <Brewster> thanks guys
[11:32:22] <madprops2> thanks robertmaxrees
[11:36:02] <taplar> hellyeah: as suggested before, do a find on your code for instances of 'event' and make sure they are being defined on the handlers.  shouldn't be lengthy, i only count two usages
[11:44:23] <graphettion> Can someone help me out? I'm trying to get audio to play during each step. - http://jsfiddle.net/t8cz1w76/
[11:46:56] <Kartagis> how do I check if there is an error at the end of a window.open?
[11:50:04] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[11:50:55] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  is it for me?
[11:51:04] <robertmaxrees> for Kartagis
[11:51:16] <hellyeah> okey
[11:53:29] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/y2xfc2gg/21/ please click on the very end buy button and it will take you to an error page. I'd like to catpture that
[11:53:43] <robertmaxrees> uh,.'
[11:53:53] <robertmaxrees> do you have control over supay.sabanciuniv.edu ?
[11:55:04] <Kartagis> a colleague does
[11:55:26] <robertmaxrees> basically, once a user has left your page, you're SOL.
[11:55:59] <robertmaxrees> the other end needs to handle the error.  you can't do anything about that unless you have some kind of pre-flight check, which may or may not work.
[11:56:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue that you have bad data at that point.
[11:57:20] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: nope
[11:57:30] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis huh?
[11:57:34] <Kartagis> that's just out of stock error
[11:57:54] <Kartagis> sorry, hit Enter too early
[11:58:07] <robertmaxrees> uh, so what are you trying to accomplish here?
[12:01:06] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis because you can't know what's happened for the user after they've left your page.  You have no control any more.  Your options are to either a) use AJAX to try to hit the URL and see where things end up, or b) get back data about whether or not that book is in stock.
[12:01:11] <robertmaxrees> b) is the safer of these two.

[12:08:41] <gurke_> is it why jquery .css() does not support css transition?
[12:09:08] <robertmaxrees> you want http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[12:09:10] <robertmaxrees> not .css()
[12:09:15] <robertmaxrees> or use css transitions and add/remove classes.
[12:09:59] <gurke_> cant use classes because i want to animate a transition from any element to any else element
[12:10:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:10:38] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean to want to scroll from one element to another?
[12:10:44] <gurke_> nono
[12:10:47] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: this is a Drupal site, and I've checked whether there is a stock field, I couldn't see one

[12:31:26] <gurke_> xD
[12:31:36] <gurke_> that would be funny
[12:31:48] <gurke_> hello prototype 11.07
[12:32:12] <taplar> i hope things will be better as compaired to 11.06.  we won't even speak of 11.02
[12:32:13] <gurke_> dont worry girl.. i give my girlfriends version control by github
[12:32:55] <taplar> it's not my fault that i objectify women.  i'm a java developer.  i objectify everything
[12:33:05] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[12:33:52] <gurke_> would be awesome if i have issues with my gf i just do a pull request and everything is fine
[12:34:10] <taplar> lmao
[12:34:18] <gurke_> haha
[12:34:30] <taplar> eeeeeeeh, i'm not sure if i like this better or not yet.  gotta stash for a sec
[12:38:50] <taplar> crap, missed blakes question.  blakespot: yeah the event would be relative to which one it originated from
[12:41:27] <neruda> robertmaxrees: sorry to bother but regarding my previous question about setting value of input field with val(), it works but the placeholder is still displayed instead of the new value
[12:41:40] <robertmaxrees> neruda have a fiddle i can look at?
[12:42:52] <neruda> robertmaxrees: unfortunately its part of a rails form (haml, jquery, simple_form, turbolinks) so im not sure how to represent all of that in a fiddle without changing the entire substance of the issue
[12:43:00] <robertmaxrees> err...
[12:43:05] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to represent all of that.
[12:43:13] <robertmaxrees> just the core bit - you have a placeholder that doesn't go away, right?
[12:43:20] <neruda> robertmaxrees: i think it would work if it were pure javascript
[12:43:22] <neruda> lol
[12:43:27] <robertmaxrees> neruda uh, what?
[12:43:36] <robertmaxrees> i must not be understanding the problem.  mind clarifying?
[12:43:50] <neruda> robertmaxrees: the stack im using makes a fiddle more misleading than helpful
[12:43:52] <gambl0re> hey robertmatrix...whats up
[12:43:57] <gambl0re> did you ask your boss yet?
[12:44:06] <taplar> lmao, it's intentional now
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> neruda could you clarify then?
[12:44:34] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re i don't thing robertmatrix is actually around right now.
[12:44:37] <robertmaxrees> *think
[12:44:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, they're not even in the channel.
[12:45:29] <taplar> gambl0re: you wouldn't happen to be a big ReBoot fan would you?
[12:47:43] <gambl0re> i used to watch reboot...it was pretty cool.
[12:49:10] <taplar> hah, according to wiki apparently they're working on a new series for it, 26 episodes greenlit this year
[13:00:04] <nardev> guys i load a form through $.get() and unfortunately js which is used to adjust some parameters on that form is loaded with parent page SO i don't get those visual settings on that ajax loaded part. Is it possible to apply global JS  to ajax loaded parts?
[13:00:20] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[13:00:24] <robertmaxrees> event handlers?
[13:00:57] <taplar> wasn't this question asked friday?
[13:01:10] <robertmaxrees> variations of it are asked all the time :)
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> i need to figure out lunch.
[13:01:22] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm....
[13:01:58] <taplar> i'm out.  good luck with the deja'vue question

[13:14:22] <muks_> Is there any issue in this code???
[13:14:32] <muks_> I need data like  //data: ["javascript","jquery","mysql","sean","clark"]
[13:14:48] <muks_> but jsonResult not populating it
[13:15:07] <AcidBeard> Did you try logging the jsonResult?
[13:15:24] <muks_> yes it is coming
[13:16:03] <AcidBeard> But is it logging as an object or string?
[13:19:44] <muks_> [{"specializationId":"39","specializations":"Analytical Chemistry"},{"specializationId":"1","specializations":"Anotomy"},
[13:19:51] <muks_> it is printing like this
[13:19:56] <AcidBeard> That's what the log says?
[13:20:07] <muks_> yes
[13:20:09] <AcidBeard> That's a string
[13:20:50] <AcidBeard> try   data: $.parseJSON(jsonResult)
[13:22:31] <muks_> ok 1 min let me try
[13:23:55] <YamakasY_> how difficult can it be to find some simple multi file upload where people need to put in their email address :S
[13:26:05] <AcidBeard> Make one
[13:27:50] <YamakasY_> AcidBeard: yes but I need ot have some reference from a good library, and even that is difficult to find
[13:28:04] <YamakasY_> lots of examples but not very good ones
[13:37:35] <thinkeyP> Hey! Is it an OK approach to write a jQuery Mobile application with different pages using one single .html document, or is it better to separate the pages into different files?

[13:43:32] <xochilpili> hi all
[13:44:25] <AcidBeard> Hello
[13:44:45] <thinkeyP> Ok
[13:44:56] <thinkeyP> I guess it is ok in my case...
[13:45:01] <xochilpili> im populating a div every 5 seconds, and i did it, but i tried to use some effect, i read some about fadeIn and fadeOut, but when i use it to $('#hints').empty(); it doesnt seems to work as i expect
[13:45:18] <thinkeyP> Is it possible to use the same header and footer on different pages?
[13:45:29] <thinkeyP> like inheritence somehow?
[13:46:44] <robertmaxrees> thinkeyP that's either a server-side thing, or you use ajax
[13:47:23] <xochilpili> http://hastebin.com/isulamerov.xml
[13:47:27] <muks_> https://jsfiddle.net/884rseLp/
[13:47:35] <muks_> What is wrong in this code?
[13:47:52] <xochilpili> i dont know what am i doing wrong, appears, but once fadeOut disappear :P
[13:48:24] <robertmaxrees> muks_ that's not a valid way to call getJSON
[13:49:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/884rseLp/1/ muks_ you need something like this probably.
[13:49:33] <AcidBeard> I just realized...you are trying to define data incorrectly
[13:55:34] <muks_> robertmaxrees AcidBeard Thanks a lot
[13:55:48] <muks_> Its working perfectly…Lots n lots of thanks
[14:01:29] <xochilpili> anyone?
[14:02:00] <bryanbailes> What is the question xochilpili?
[14:02:15] <robertmaxrees> xochilpili try rephrasing.  i'm not entirely sure i understand.
[14:02:23] <xochilpili> http://hastebin.com/isulamerov.xml
[14:02:43] <xochilpili> this is working fadeOut, but it doesnt display the content
[14:03:13] <robertmaxrees> where do you fade it back in?
[14:03:37] <xochilpili> no where?
[14:03:45] <robertmaxrees> so there's your solution.
[14:03:54] <robertmaxrees> fade it back in after you do all that other stuff in the success callbacl.
[14:03:56] <robertmaxrees> *callback
[14:04:11] <xochilpili> robertmaxrees, but should be $('#hints').fadeIn(); ??
[14:04:21] <xochilpili> or needs to be in another function or ..?

[14:05:12] <bryanbailes> robertmaxrees: I have a jquery-ui widget that I created. One of the options for said widget is an object that can contain objects of its own. Say I want to change $.ui.widget.prototype.options.foo.bar.baz from the page that initialized the widget. I have a variable with a reference to  $.ui.widget.prototype.options.foo.bar and I know that I want to change baz. How can I pass this option to the widget?
[14:05:46] <robertmaxrees> bryanbailes hold up - what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[14:06:20] <bryanbailes> Just changing an option in the widget, but without knowing the exact location of the option (instead I have the location as an object reference variable)
[14:06:53] <robertmaxrees> $( ".selector" ).accordion( "option", "animate", 200 );
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> just use this.
[14:08:04] <bryanbailes> Yes, but that would be knowing where the option is. I don't know where the option is in the object structure, just have a pointer to it in a variable.
[14:08:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> you don't know the name of the option, but you want to change it?
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> that's really strange.
[14:08:42] <bryanbailes> The option I want to change is options.foo.bar.baz, I don't know that baz is located at foo.bar, but I have a variable with a pointer to foo.bar.
[14:09:05] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle with what you're doing?
[14:09:14] <bryanbailes> I'll create one, give me a minute.
[14:20:03] <r3v3rb> hi all, if i have my form collected in a var (surprisingly called 'form') how can I get the value of one of the inputs within it?
[14:20:17] <robertmaxrees> how did you "collect" it?
[14:20:46] <r3v3rb> var form = $(this).closest('form');
[14:20:54] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, ^^
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> then just do form.find('input')
[14:21:31] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, hmm, tried that buit get undefined in developer tools
[14:22:07] <r3v3rb> i'll check again
[14:24:28] <r3v3rb> perfect i was trying .find('input[type=email']).val(); just getting input appears to work
[14:24:35] <r3v3rb> thankls robertmaxrees ^^
[14:24:49] <r3v3rb> thanks* bloody surface keyboard!
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> sure.  btw yours could have worked - you need 'input[type="email"]' <- see the extra quotes?
[14:25:14] <r3v3rb> arghhhhhhhh... lol robertmaxrees
[14:43:33] <wcfields> Anyone run into this issue, I'm running fullscreen and after my funtions end, the jquery stops

[14:48:43] <AcidBeard> ...that's weird
[14:51:39] <kevireilly> wcfields: can you reproduce in a jsfiddle?
[14:54:48] <bryanbailes> robertmaxrees: Put together a jsfiddle, sorry it took so long. http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ELggp4eFgo
[15:19:25] <thinkeyP> I'm using jQuery mobile together with jQuery knob and getting a long grey line under the knob. Any ideas? :/
[15:20:10] <AcidBeard> Can you put it in JSFiddle?
[15:20:18] <AcidBeard> Or link to the page?
[15:20:29] <thinkeyP> It's a pretty large mobile application
[15:20:33] <thinkeyP> But I can try

[15:26:20] <thinkeyP> this is the code: http://pastebin.com/7Jk1uCk5
[15:26:41] <thinkeyP> unfortunately you need the js/jquery.knob.js
[15:26:57] <thinkeyP> which can be found here: https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Knob/tree/master/js
[15:28:45] <thinkeyP> AcidBeard : do you think you can manage to reproduce the page using those, or should i try to create a jsfiddle?
[15:29:39] <bryanbailes> Created my jsfiddle, hoping someone can help me figure this out: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ELggp4eFgo
[15:30:46] <AcidBeard> Could I reporduce it?  Yes.  But I am also working so I don't have time.
[15:30:56] <thinkeyP> Ok
[15:31:05] <thinkeyP> No problem
[15:33:28] <thinkeyP> Here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/xdegqqdj/
[15:35:07] <thinkeyP> there seems to be something with http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css
[15:37:55] <AcidBeard> Just put in some custom css like border: none transparent 0 !important for that element
[15:39:44] <AcidBeard> http://jsfiddle.net/xdegqqdj/1/
[15:39:51] <AcidBeard> Look at the style I added
[15:43:55] <thinkeyP> AcidBeard : That worked perfectly! Thanks alot!!
[15:46:35] <AcidBeard> Cool, no problem
[15:51:07] <AcidBeard> bryanbailes: You still need help?
[15:51:48] <bryanbailes> I do, just making a quick tweak to my fiddle. 1 sec.

[16:03:43] <_clarity> hey. I'm using jquery ui tabs to develop a site. My problem is I have 3 nested levels of tabs with tons of graphs. How can I make it so that only one tab loads the data at once
[16:08:09] <_clarity> is this a help channel?
[16:09:54] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[16:10:16] <robertmaxrees> depending on availability and other stuff.
[16:10:24] <_clarity> word
[16:12:36] <robertmaxrees> and that's kind of a big question,
[16:12:43] <_clarity> my question is?
[16:12:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:13:08] <robertmaxrees> you can init the first three and then init the next set of data based on whatever.
[16:14:39] <_clarity> yeah. I thought about populating the currently open tab only
[16:14:49] <_clarity> but the question then becomes can I get the currently open tab

[16:27:35] <bryanbailes> Is anyone else able to help (robertmaxrees)?
[16:28:47] <bryanbailes> I have a nice jsfiddle and everything :)
[16:32:29] <bryanbailes> robertmaxrees: still here?
[16:41:34] <robertmaxrees> am now.
[16:41:41] <robertmaxrees> busy busy busy day.
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> so wait.
[16:42:14] <bryanbailes> You got it. Thanks.
[16:42:21] <robertmaxrees> lol sorry.
[16:42:25] <robertmaxrees> don't mean to be a jerk.
[16:42:32] <bryanbailes> Not at all, I get it.
[16:43:08] <robertmaxrees> so you're talking about the widget factory in general, not about JQUI?
[16:43:26] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm still really confused about the situation - why don't you have access to the option itself?
[16:43:54] <bryanbailes> Did you see my fiddle?
[16:44:01] <bryanbailes> http://jsfiddle.net/644jhj7j/
[16:44:39] <bryanbailes> Should explain what I'm trying to do
[16:50:44] <bryanbailes> Sorry, should have prefixed that with your name so it doesn't get lost in the text.

[16:57:11] <starsync> hi guys, non-urgent newb jquery/js question: https://jsfiddle.net/en9p6rmw/ when I click on the div, it does nothing instead of increasing its width to 200px; what am I doing wrong? thank you
[16:58:56] <kevireilly> starsync: missing the jquery dependency on jsfiddle (top left area) and then missing $ on line 2 -- https://jsfiddle.net/en9p6rmw/2/
[16:59:27] <kevireilly> starsync: mostly determined due to having the Javascript Console open
[16:59:49] <starsync> lol, oops :-P thanks!! now I will work on ifs and elses
[17:00:55] <kevireilly> no problem
[17:01:36] <kevireilly> starsync: related but not, may also want to look into CSS transitions
[17:01:58] <theskillwithin> HA HA HA
[17:02:00] <theskillwithin> HA HA HA
[17:02:27] <theskillwithin> sorry I stuck around to see the answer to that question, the answer suprised me,
[17:02:29] <starsync> kevireilly: hehe yeah, that's what I'm used to -- need to do more complicated stuff which is why I'm trying to learn jquery
[17:02:35] <theskillwithin> yea... your not loading jquery...
[17:02:42] <theskillwithin> little funny
[17:02:43] <theskillwithin> happens
[17:02:58] <kevireilly> starsync: ah gotcha gotcha
[17:13:57] <nardev> guys http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31528356/refresh-javascript-and-css-after-ajax-get
[17:32:18] <kevireilly> nardev: you're likely looking bind to dynamically added elements
[17:32:33] <nardev> kevireilly, well
[17:32:37] <kevireilly> nardev: IE: $(document).on('click', '.dynamicallyAddedElement', function(e){ });
[17:33:04] <nardev> :( the problem is, i gulp all 15-20 js files that i have in single all.js
[17:33:21] <nardev> maybe it's pointless to do it that way :( i don't know
[17:33:34] <kevireilly> eh?
[18:02:11] <nardev> kevireilly, it is so strange, i really think that i wxplained it well
[18:02:19] <nardev> *explained
[18:02:30] <nardev> i can't understand what i'm missing :(
[18:03:30] <kevireilly> nardev: probably missing specifics. So far what you've said here and stackoverflow appear to be different / unrelated
[18:03:50] <kevireilly> sometimes, more info is better than less, and a single paragraph probably isn't cutting it
[18:03:50] <nardev> can i try again :$
[18:04:23] <kevireilly> but of course
[18:05:04] <nardev> imagine, i have simple web page with "div.content" and i have a button in a menu, i pres that button and it makes ajax request to my server and fetch "some html content" and place it into div.content
[18:05:12] <nardev> all works great
[18:05:18] <nardev> BUT
[18:05:54] <nardev> i have many javascripts which are all loaded in within parent webpage
[18:05:56] <nardev> so
[18:06:25] <nardev> some specific javascript actions are not applied to newly loaded form
[18:06:38] <nardev> so i want to "reload" all.js
[18:06:54] <nardev> again after i load "some html content"
[18:07:04] <nardev> kevireilly,
[18:07:16] <kevireilly> nardev: right right, i read in between the blanks with my original suggestion
[18:07:36] <kevireilly> generally, you're trying to bind events to dynamically generated content
[18:07:38] <nardev> oki..
[18:07:42] <nardev> yep
[18:08:14] <Crucials> kevireilly just said it, you have 1 problem but trying to apply the wrong solution to it, which is confusing. generally its better to just letting people know your actual problem
[18:08:23] <Crucials> which is binding to generated content
[18:09:26] <nardev> Crucials, kevireilly
[18:09:32] <nardev> i get the point
[18:09:46] <nardev> i was trying to "solve" the problem in a wrong way
[18:10:01] <nardev> but in my mind it was easier not to ever thing if i missed some
[18:10:04] <nardev> event
[18:10:23] <nardev> to load it with ajax html load
[18:10:38] <nardev> now i have $('input[type="checkbox"]').bootstrapToggle();
[18:16:44] <kevireilly> nardev: this can be a generally hard problem to solve, although it seems a solution might be so simple. Re-running all JavaScript isn't really feasible and I'm guessing my contrived example isn't as simple as your use case. One option is to have a routine that is aware of what needs to take place after a certain type of content is fetch from a third party and added to the page. That way you have a logical process of menu button pressed, get menu conten
[18:16:45] <kevireilly> bind / run things applicable when menu content is on the page
[18:17:41] <nardev> kevireilly, obviously this ajax/partial page & form load
[18:17:52] <nardev> makes more problems than solutions?
[18:18:57] <nardev> kevireilly, in my example, i have this http://www.bootstraptoggle.com/  it works if checkbox is on the web page but if i load in additional form trhough ajax it doesn't work ok..
[18:19:08] <nardev> so i guess, i should switch back to static
[18:19:13] <nardev> load content :(
[18:20:01] <kevireilly> nardev: sorry, perhaps there is something from my previous statement that I can clarify? In other words, if you $('input[type="checkbox"]').bootstrapToggle(); after you add the new content to the page, it will probably work
[18:20:21] <nardev> kevireilly, and it works ok
[18:20:40] <nardev> but i don't want to think for every form which i load in through ajax
[18:20:50] <nardev> that i need to add that line
[18:21:43] <kevireilly> you can setup a function or something
[18:34:15] <kevireilly> nardev: we tend to work best with examples. Here is somewhere to get you started: http://jsfiddle.net/yhr05Lgx/1/
[18:36:01] <nardev> kevireilly, exactly what i did later
[18:36:04] <nardev> and it is ok
[18:36:24] <nardev> my problem is that it can happen that i have 10 of those events, maybe i have date picker too
[18:36:27] <nardev> and some others
[18:36:38] <nardev> and i don't want to think about that that much
[18:36:44] <nardev> that was my problem
[18:36:47] <nardev> but it is ok now
[18:36:57] <nardev> thank you very much for your efforts
[18:37:00] <nardev> thank you
[18:46:51] <kevireilly> nardev: no problem, i actually didn't include something to make that aspect more easier but could be another data-xyz that conditionally does bootstrapToggle.. i dunno, having a hard time imagining right now :)
[18:47:17] <nardev> thank you kevireilly
[18:47:25] <kevireilly> no worries at all
[18:55:17] <jak2000> hi all
[18:55:46] <jak2000> the best way for load an jQuery function (when the page charge) is in <body onload   ?
[18:57:16] <nodist> some would argue that but take a look at this http://modernweb.com/2013/05/06/5-things-you-should-stop-doing-with-jquery/
[18:58:07] <nodist> do you mean on page load?
[18:59:00] <jak2000> yes
[18:59:42] <nodist> I put my scripts at the bottom for page speed(scripts that do stuff to the page, not stuff like analytics)

[19:36:34] <jakesyl>   Hello, I'm working on a website and would like to make a login like this: https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?hl=en&continue=https://www.google.com/#identifier (with the box) any idea how to do this?
[19:48:06] <acidjazz> jakesyl: are you using gogle to login?
[19:48:21] <acidjazz> jakesyl: you mean oauth? or straight up make it look like that?
[19:51:37] <jakesyl> just make it look like that
[19:52:48] <jakesyl> here's what  I have so far: https://gist.github.com/jakesyl/7c81dc31640068068775 I'm working on this right now: https://jsfiddle.net/f780xcs3/ but nothings showing up
[19:54:50] <acidjazz> jakesyl: i dsay this is more of a #css question
[19:57:08] <jakesyl> alright
[21:45:04] <lindii_> any idea why i might be getting this 500 error with this url img/a2.jpg when i try to convert my ajax response like var $data = $(data);
[22:21:29] <jakesyl> is this a common error: http://imgur.com/G8THmEG and how do i fix it?
[22:27:59] <Uhkis> jakesyl: this channel is for jquery, not plain css questions
[22:58:24] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[23:38:55] <root3d> i am trying to re use bootstrap modal but seems like it's in chain reaction: https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/d534192297ab1ae1d597
[23:39:08] <root3d> html out i get: http://i.imgur.com/PXebuti.png
[23:39:26] <root3d> gurke_, morning there
[23:40:44] <Cork> root3d: make a jsfiddle
[23:40:52] <Cork> images of the html isn't helping anyone
[23:41:48] <root3d> Cork, ok.
[23:43:15] <Uhkis> root3d: every time you .clone(), you're cloning _all_ the modals with that class so it doubles in size on every clone
[23:44:03] <root3d> Uhkis, absolutely correct.
[23:44:20] <root3d> lesson learnt: clone by id only
[23:44:39] <root3d> Cork, Uhkis : you are true savers
[23:44:58] <hellyeah> hey
[23:45:00] <hellyeah> anyone around
[23:45:27] <root3d> hellyeah, just ask
[23:46:04] <hellyeah> what do you think about making a global var is good practice or bad practice when you select table or something else from dom that you will use this element in one function or more than one function?
