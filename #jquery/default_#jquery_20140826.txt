[00:25:25] <uskerine> hi, could someone help me to understand what this actually does:             str.replace(/[^x\%\d]/g,'');  ?                (str is a string variable)
[00:36:16] <Cork> uskerine: it removes x % or any digit at the beginning of a line
[00:36:24] <Cork> oh sorry
[00:36:43] <Cork> it removes anything EXCEPT x % or a digit from the string
[00:37:19] <Cork> /[^x\%\d]/g matches anything not in that [] list and replaces it with ''
[00:37:22] <phx> [^ negates the set, right
[00:37:25] <Cork> yes
[00:37:56] <Cork> i first read it as ^[] and that would have been the beginning of line
[00:38:07] <phx> may i suggest you a mug of coffee? :)
[00:38:39] <Cork> phx: not sure what a mug would help here
[00:39:09] <phx> you know, a cup is like a few mililitres. a mug is like 2dl
[00:39:27] <Cork> phx: well i don't drink coffee so...
[00:39:30] <phx> oh
[00:39:58] <phx> i never really understood how some techies can live without coffee. irc and coffee are just so essential to life :)
[00:40:06] <Cork> lol
[00:40:33] <PxlVision> black coffee or go home
[00:40:54] <PxlVision> none of this cream and sugar training wheels stuff
[00:41:13] <Cork> i have a few coworkers that are like that
[00:41:17] <phx> lol
[00:41:27] <Cork> they go bananas if the coffee machine goes out of order
[00:42:05] <PxlVision> tea works too, like blood orange puerh is tasty and caffeinated still
[00:42:22] <Cork> nope not my thing either :D
[00:42:47] <PxlVision> so whats your poison than?
[00:43:00] <Cork> uh
[00:43:08] <Cork> juice?
[00:43:34] <PxlVision> orange juice and vodka! thought so, you sounded like a drinker
[00:43:40] <Cork> O_o'
[00:43:59] <Cork> at work??
[00:44:11] <phx> actually it all works together
[00:44:42] <phx> coffee - increases blood pressure, and makes you thisrty. To mitigate the blood pressure, you need a vodka, and to help the thirst, you need a beer
[00:44:57] <phx> therefore beer+coffee+vodka are a perfect trio to start the day with :)
[00:45:13] <Cork> ouch...
[00:45:28] <PxlVision> i could see doing that in a shot
[00:45:39] <phx> that would make a cocktail
[00:45:58] <PxlVision> i'm not sipping that kind of thing
[00:46:08] <PxlVision> better to get it out of the way at once
[00:46:13] <phx> lol
[00:49:09] <PxlVision> g'night !
[01:30:17] <ripthejacker> Hi everyone, How do I select the ancestor of an element matching a particular selector?
[01:30:37] <ripthejacker> Currently I
[01:30:52] <ripthejacker> I'm doing it like this '$($(this).parents('.wholecontainer')[0])
[01:31:22] <ripthejacker> But I'm guessing I'm doing it wrong because I'm doing $ twice.
[01:32:23] <ripthejacker> Please help.
[01:35:31] <hecatonicosachor> ripthejacker, why the [0]?
[01:35:53] <ripthejacker> hecatonicosachor, .parent() returns an array.
[01:36:03] <hecatonicosachor> I know it returns an array.
[01:36:40] <hecatonicosachor> That doesn't explain the logic behind your code.
[01:36:44] <ripthejacker> hecatonicosachor, So I'm getting the first element from the array
[01:36:51] <hecatonicosachor> yes, and I asked, why?
[01:37:22] <ripthejacker> I just need the one element that satisfies the condition.
[01:37:41] <ripthejacker> hecatonicosachor, ^
[01:37:54] <hecatonicosachor> and what makes you think it's the first one?
[01:38:22] <hecatonicosachor> you can replace [0] with .eq(0)
[01:38:41] <hecatonicosachor> but I still don't see why you need to limit your selection to the first element
[01:39:08] <ripthejacker> hecatonicosachor, Because there can be only one parent that has the class wholecontainer.
[01:39:30] <hecatonicosachor> then you don't need the .eq(0) (or [0]) at all.
[01:39:41] <hecatonicosachor> also, you might want to use .closest() instead.
[01:39:57] <vishaldeep> closest returns one element
[01:40:08] <vishaldeep> you can use it instead
[01:40:47] <ripthejacker> hecatonicosachor, vishaldeep thanks guys, that's exactly what I need. :)
[01:45:51] <Rudeboy> Does anyone know how I could add "loading..." to the second dropdown of a populated dropdown? This one to be exact: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/158929/filter-second-dropdown-tax-based-on-first-dropdown-cpt
[01:46:14] <Rudeboy> So that "loading.." shows in the second dropdown each time an option in dropdown 1 is selected
[01:46:50] <vishaldeep> You can add an empty option with "loading.." text when the first one is loading
[01:47:35] <vishaldeep> and when the second one is loaded, the option with "loading" text will automatically replaced with the new content
[01:48:01] <Rudeboy> vishaldeep: I've been trying all morning to do that ha ha, not sure what I'm doing wrong. The furthest I've gotten is having "loading..." appear once, but then it stops working. I've been trying to implement these: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1120920/show-loading-in-dropdown-box?lq=1
[01:48:21] <vishaldeep> can you create a jsfiddle for the issue?
[01:49:15] <Rudeboy> vishaldeep: I'm not sure how to, since it's quite a complex bit of code:/
[01:49:34] <vishaldeep> can you share your code on paste bin?
[01:50:08] <Rudeboy> It's the exact code as in the first link I shared. That was by StackExchange question :)
[01:50:14] <Rudeboy> my*
[01:55:55] <vishaldeep> Rudeboy: check this http://pastebin.com/01yj14w1
[01:55:59] <vishaldeep> check the second line
[01:57:36] <Zitter> Hi, is it possible that $("#element div.class").on("click", function(){}); works (but only *one* time) and $(document).on("click", "#element div.class", function(){}); does NOT work?
[01:57:40] <Rudeboy> vishaldeep: Oh my glory, I tried that earlier but put it one line above by accident ha ha:) It's working flawlessly now though, thanks so much! :D
[01:58:11] <Cork> Zitter: no, the first one binds to the selected elements, while the second one binds to document
[01:58:21] <Cork> Zitter: meaning the first one only works on elements that exist
[01:58:38] <Cork> while the second one works on all elements that match the selector as long as you don't remove the event handler
[02:00:07] <Rudeboy> vishaldeep: Oh, I see you also did this: select[name="location"]
[02:00:21] <Rudeboy> vishaldeep: Thanks so much again, it's really working well :)
[02:05:52] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/7eyehxhq/
[02:05:58] <Koopz> funny thing....
[02:11:40] <Koopz> how can i access the correct background-color?
[02:13:06] <hecatonicosachor> option:selected
[02:13:46] <Koopz> that doesn't change anything^^
[02:14:34] <Zitter> Cork, element still exists. It is modified, but still exists.
[02:15:13] <Zitter> and I knew that bindind on document would act as "live" selection
[02:15:49] <Koopz> the option's background-color changes when hovering and the element's background-color get's set to the system's default highlighting color when choosing an option
[02:19:21] <Koopz> guess i'll have to write myself a javascript array containing the colors for each value
[02:19:45] <mukesh> need help for jquery
[02:19:46] <Cork> Koopz: http://jsfiddle.net/7eyehxhq/2/
[02:20:08] <Cork> Zitter: if the element isn't replaced by another element the first one should still work
[02:20:19] <mukesh> how to get news list from website according to keyword
[02:20:26] <Cork> Zitter: and exits, isn't enough it has to be exactly the same dom element
[02:20:36] <Cork> so parsing again from html means replace
[02:20:52] <Koopz> Cork: oh well... thanks! :D
[02:21:08] <mukesh> like i want all news which have keyword like 'delhi india'
[02:21:15] <Cork> Koopz: basically, as the element get a background-color from the ua when you hover it
[02:21:24] <Cork> you can't ask for the background-color currently in use
[02:21:26] <mukesh> for Cork: hello
[02:21:46] <Cork> Koopz: that said, i would prob put that value into a separate attribute instead
[02:21:54] <Cork> regex parsing style is nasty
[02:22:15] <Cork> mukesh: what keyword are you talking about?
[02:24:41] <mukesh> means i want all news from timesofindia .com wesite which have keyword like 'htc desire'
[02:25:18] <mukesh> can i get all news with keyword from website
[02:25:27] <mukesh> and show to my website page
[02:29:01] <mukesh> ??
[02:31:14] <hicksi> hey, can somebody help me. i want to bind a plugin to two input elements. so when i click on the element the same plugin with the selected options should be open. http://pastebin.com/e8xZbUhD
[02:31:32] <mukesh>  i want all news from timesofindia .com wesite which have keyword like 'htc desire'
[02:31:43] <hicksi> thanks in advance :)
[02:31:46] <mukesh> can somebody help me
[02:32:08] <Cork> mukesh: you mean you want to spider the site?
[02:33:04] <mukesh> no
[02:33:34] <mukesh> but get news related to keyword and relased to that day
[02:33:35] <Cork> hicksi: $('#LivestreamChannelStatistic_dateFrom, #LivestreamChannelStatistic_dateTo').datepicker()
[02:33:53] <hicksi> thanks :)
[02:33:57] <Cork> mukesh: but you are talking about the <meta keyword> tag right?
[02:33:58] <hicksi> wow. yea i could think of it myself
[02:34:02] <hicksi> but thanks :)
[02:34:03] <Cork> or again what do you mean by keywords?
[02:34:21] <Cork> hicksi: but for your code you do var options = {};
[02:34:23] <mukesh> no not about meta tag
[02:34:29] <mukesh> wait one min
[02:34:32] <mukesh> let me show
[02:34:35] <Cork> and then $().datepicker(options); $().datepicker(options)
[02:35:30] <mukesh> cork: see this page
[02:35:31] <mukesh> http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city
[02:36:01] <Cork> ya <meta name="keywords" content="cities news, city news,indian cities news,local news,latest city news,metro cities news,local city news,metro city news,times city news,indian cities,latest city news">
[02:36:03] <mukesh> i want all news related to 'jaipur' city from this website and want to show on my website
[02:36:07] <Cork> or again what keywords are you talking about?
[02:36:28] <Cork> that is the only existance of "keywords" on that page
[02:36:48] <Cork> mukesh: ok, so you do want to spider
[02:36:57] <mukesh> ohh i think you can't get my query
[02:37:14] <Cork> mukesh: you can't spider a third party site from js no
[02:37:21] <Cork> you have to do that server side
[02:38:05] <mukesh> ok means i can't get any content from third party side??
[02:38:40] <Cork> mukesh: not unless the site explicitly creates an api to access it
[02:38:44] <Cork> except for images
[02:38:50] <Cork> (for legacy reasons)
[02:39:10] <mukesh> how can i access api for that
[02:39:11] <Cork> if images was added today they would be blocked by default too
[02:39:22] <Cork> mukesh: the site would have to provide one
[02:39:27] <Cork> there isn't a generic api...
[02:41:15] <mukesh> ok thanx cork
[02:42:08] <mukesh> actually i develop a new search engine type website which related to all local news
[02:45:00] <Cork> mukesh: then you would have to have a dedicated indexer spider
[02:46:12] <mukesh> ok some tips for site seo
[02:46:27] <Cork> correction you don't have to have
[02:46:31] <Cork> you would WANT to have :)
[02:47:03] <Cork> as else you would have to run a script against every site you want to list for every search
[02:47:14] <Cork> and that would be ridiculously slow
[02:47:20] <Cork> (5 mins per search anyone? :D)
[02:49:20] <elmcrest> Hi jquery experts :) ... is there maybe a fine solution to just make any possible html element with text or numbers in it editable? ... f.e. with a edit button somewhere on the page, but maybe without using a textarea or input field for everything? ... is that just something that doesn't exist? (modern browser support only would be ok)
[02:49:49] <Cork> elmcrest: please less filler content and more question
[02:50:20] <Cork> scanning a novel to find the question is counter productive for you
[02:50:31] <Cork> *asking ppl to scanning
[02:51:03] <elmcrest> Cork ok, I have a <p>...</p> ... is there a way to have a "edit-button" on the page and than edit the p content? didn't want to have you scanning sry ;)
[02:51:14] <Cork> ah
[02:51:18] <Cork> much better
[02:51:28] <Cork> elmcrest: you can set contentEditable on any element to make them editable
[02:51:33] <Cork> ?g mdn contentEditable
[02:51:35] <b-ot> Cork: Content Editable - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable
[02:51:50] <Cork> and any child of them becomes editable by inheritance
[02:52:04] <elmcrest> Cork nice! thx! :)
[02:52:08] <Cork> yw
[02:52:13] <elmcrest> and thx b-ot ;)
[03:21:03] <intellilogic> How can I just get a files headers?
[03:21:11] <intellilogic> (w/o entire file)
[03:24:16] <intellilogic> Currently I am ajax and read file header, but I am getting the entire file :-/
[03:24:24] <Cork> intellilogic: http doesn't have files, so you can't
[03:24:49] <Cork> if you mean the http headers, you could try making a head (i think it is called that) request
[03:24:57] <Cork> and if the server supports it you might just get the headers
[03:25:15] <Cork> but client can't dictate what the server sends
[03:25:58] <intellilogic> Some people avoid it, but I already have highly modified servers, so moding them is ok.
[03:26:07] <intellilogic> K, let me check head request
[03:26:28] <Cork> intellilogic: start by checking for the correct name
[03:26:42] <intellilogic> k
[03:26:44] <Cork> i know there is a verb for it, but i don't remember the correct name
[03:26:46] <intellilogic> Current method:  	$.ajax({cache: false,url:myFile,success:function(d,s,request){
[03:26:46] <intellilogic> 		console.log(request.getResponseHeader("Last-Modified"));
[03:26:46] <intellilogic> 	}});
[03:38:48] <intellilogic> $.ajax({type:"HEAD"...;  :)
[03:40:10] <Cork> intellilogic: did it work?
[03:58:22] <sprihodko> Howdy? Just one question. Can i select element by its value? e.g element.val() => "hello" $(document).find('val=hello')
[04:00:17] <Cork> O_o
[04:00:25] <Cork> thx for giving me a full minute to answer...
[04:02:00] <Uhkis> :)
[04:05:51] <vishaldeep> sprihodko: have you tried $("[value='hello']")
[04:06:47] <Cork> vishaldeep: doesn't work
[04:06:58] <Cork> so select on val you have to use filter
[04:07:27] <Cork> $(':input').filter(function(elm) { return $(elm).val() == 'value to match'; })
[04:07:40] <Cork> [] matches attributes not the state of the dom form element
[04:08:18] <vishaldeep> Cork: it worked here: http://jsfiddle.net/ax0yp3ya/
[04:10:37] <vishaldeep> but I got your point Cork
[04:10:45] <sprihodko> it works! kudos to you!! Before i just tried it like this $("[value=new]") and of course it not worked
[04:11:53] <sprihodko> And filter is also good idea. I will remember it for future
[04:11:59] <vishaldeep> sprihodko: please note that it will only work if the value=new in the HTML itself and not if the input was empty and you typed 'new' in there
[04:12:58] <sprihodko> hm, and with filter?
[04:13:19] <vishaldeep> with filter it will work always
[04:13:51] <vishaldeep> because it checks the current value, and not the attribute
[04:14:46] <Cork> vishaldeep: http://jsfiddle.net/ax0yp3ya/1/
[04:14:53] <Cork> so nope doesn't work :)
[04:15:21] <vishaldeep> Cork: I mentioned that in comment above :)
[04:15:36] <Cork> ya
[04:15:43] <vishaldeep> as you suggested, filter is better
[04:15:58] <Cork> well it is the only option is you want the value of the input field
[04:16:08] <Cork> and not just an attribute on an html tag
[04:16:13] <vishaldeep> right
[04:16:31] <Cork> well technically you could write a custom filter
[04:16:33] <Cork> but.. why
[04:16:54] <sprihodko> Tnx to you! I will try, and will be watching if i need filter or not
[04:18:04] <prohobo> ill be watching you
[04:19:54] <Cork> a lalla lalla long~
[04:33:06] <sprihodko> And what if i want to find element like this $("[value=$secondElm.val()]"). How can i write that?
[04:35:00] <AdamPDotty> $("[value="+$secondElm.val()+"]")
[04:38:13] <sprihodko> Tnx! I just thought it should have better way
[04:45:56] <lolmaus> How do i send a normal, non-Ajax, redirecting request with jQuery? I need to do RESTful POST and PUT/PATCH requests while sending JSON data, so using an $('<form>').submit() hack is not an option.
[04:57:27] <Cork> lolmaus: uh, why not ajax?
[04:58:10] <Cork> sprihodko: you should not use .val() concated into a selector
[04:58:21] <Cork> sprihodko: i really strongly must recommend to use .filter
[04:59:00] <sprihodko> ok i will rewrite it in a minute
[05:05:24] <lolmaus> Cork: because i want the page to follow the request's URL. If i do an Ajax request, then Rails redirects it to the resulting page.
[05:05:32] <lolmaus> And the request loops forever.
[05:08:09] <sprihodko> filter not working when i changed $(':input') to $('.newClass'). What am i doing wrong?
[05:08:43] <lolmaus> sprihodko: could yyou be more specific?
[05:09:04] <Cork> lolmaus: sounds like you have a bug in the server side then
[05:09:32] <Cork> lolmaus: but if you have to post data use a form, rails has a _method param it checks if you need to do patch/put
[05:09:51] <Cork> sprihodko: could you show the full selector
[05:10:52] <sprihodko> tagToChange = $(".select2-tags").filter (elm) ->
[05:10:52] <sprihodko>       $(elm).val() is "green"
[05:11:35] <Cork> $(elm).val() is "green ??
[05:11:43] <Cork> is that a coffeescript thing?
[05:11:44] <sprihodko> coffeescript
[05:11:48] <Cork> ugg
[05:11:57] * Cork hates coffeescript even more
[05:12:13] <sprihodko> )))
[05:12:26] <Cork> sprihodko: that should work, the only recommendation i can give is to check the generated js
[05:12:53] <sprihodko> it gives me error Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined
[05:13:21] <Cork> not from that line i hope
[05:15:01] <Cork> sprihodko: one thing that might be worth checking is that $(".select2-tags") actually finds the elements you expect it to find
[05:16:42] <sprihodko> $('.select2-tags').each () ->
[05:16:42] <sprihodko>   console.log $(this).val()
[05:16:42] <sprihodko> gives me right values
[05:17:14] <Cork> and if you replace each with filter (elm)
[05:17:18] <Cork> and this with elm?
[05:19:24] <sprihodko> Tried it and got error
[05:19:35] <Cork> O_o
[05:22:05] <Cork> sprihodko: ah, sorry
[05:22:14] <airdem> $(selector).click(function doStuff() { stuff; }); <-- is there a way to make doStuff a global function?
[05:22:22] <airdem> while keeping it there where it is
[05:22:29] <Cork> sprihodko: you skip the elm and it should work
[05:22:54] <Cork> sprihodko: http://jsfiddle.net/o4m72ffn/
[05:23:09] <Cork> airdem: no
[05:23:18] <Cork> airdem: it is a way to pass a named function
[05:23:36] <Cork> the name is still for that function
[05:23:52] <airdem> so outside of that click function i wont be able to call doStuff
[05:23:52] <Cork> meaning $(selector).click(function doStuff() { stuff; }); doStuff() <-- undefined name
[05:23:57] <airdem> unless i define it outside
[05:24:01] <Cork> yes
[05:24:02] <airdem> i see
[05:24:04] <airdem> thank you
[05:26:44] <sprihodko> It works now! Thanks to you!
[05:26:58] <Cork> js> print((function test() { return arguments.callee.name })())
[05:27:03] <b-ot> Cork: test
[05:27:07] <Cork> airdem: ^that is the difference the name does
[05:27:11] <Cork> js> print((function() { return arguments.callee.name })())
[05:27:16] <b-ot> Cork:
[05:27:46] <Cork> sprihodko: sorry for the mixup
[05:28:18] <sprihodko> no problem (thumbup)
[05:28:46] <lolmaus> Cork, i would like to вщ a normal, non-ajax page redirect but with a POST/GET request. What i want is identical to a form submit, but instead of passing FormData with fields, i would like to pass a JSON-like object.
[05:29:07] <Cork> lolmaus: you can't
[05:29:30] <Cork> you only have two options to do post requests ajax or a form
[05:29:38] <Cork> there is no third option
[05:29:44] <Cork> (yet)
[05:30:02] <Cork> em6 provides that though
[05:30:43] <lolmaus> Cork: can i do a form submit and substitute it's FormData with a custom object?
[05:30:55] <Cork> nope
[05:31:02] <Cork> then you would have to do an ajax call
[05:35:36] <lolmaus> Cork: thank you. Now i have a funny problem: Rails receives the PUT request, thinks that it's a form submit and redirects to the updated page (thinking that it redirects a browser). But in fact it redirects my Ajax request, effectively forming a loop.
[05:36:11] <axilla> Can a JQuery object be plain text or does it have to be an element?  I need to pass the HTML itself instead of an element id or class.
[05:36:27] <axilla> $('<div id="#foo"></div>')
[05:36:28] <Cork> lolmaus: this kinda belongs in #rubyonrails
[05:36:43] <Cork> but you should just be able to define a respond_to for json
[05:36:48] <Cork> and not do the redirect there
[05:37:00] <Cork> rails scaffolding even creates this by default
[05:37:12] <axilla> scaffolding ><
[05:37:15] <lolmaus> Cork: thx.
[05:37:18] <axilla> who uses scaffolding anymore.
[05:37:24] <Cork> axilla: yes you can create elements with $()
[05:37:31] <axilla> its so insecure.
[05:37:48] <Cork> axilla: i thing you think of something else
[05:38:01] <axilla> so my JQuery object doesn't necessarily need to be an element ID or class.. I can create the element.
[05:38:21] <axilla> rails generate scaffold?
[05:38:32] <Cork> axilla: yes, $() has support for converting the sting into a document fragment
[05:38:41] <axilla> excellent :)
[05:38:55] <axilla> so jqmodal should do exactly what I need then :)
[05:39:00] <Cork> axilla: also note that if the html is not static
[05:39:12] <Cork> you should use $($.parseHTML) instead of just plain $()
[05:39:22] <Cork> as $() will throw in some situations
[05:39:28] <axilla> well, we are currently using simplemodal in our app, we're switching because we need support for nested modals and it doesn't support it.
[05:39:47] <axilla> we currently have a wrapper where we pass in the div with the modal content so that we don't have a bunch of hidden div's around the app.
[05:41:41] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/ce34328032970b85ed73
[05:43:04] <axilla> so i just wanted to make sure that the same functionality could be supported for jqmodal :)
[05:43:12] <axilla> as i did through the code.
[05:43:37] <axilla> also allows us to switch up modal libs pretty easily
[05:44:05] <MalekAlrwily> Hi
[05:44:14] <tomatto> hi
[05:44:45] <tomatto> please, how can i set current year to datepicker, when i have set date format to dd.mm. only?
[05:44:50] <MalekAlrwily> Arabic letters got separated in jquery
[05:45:37] <MalekAlrwily> but that happens in chrome only
[05:45:51] <Cork> MalekAlrwily: jquery doesn't do anything special to text, so that is done by the js engine or the browsers rendering engine
[05:46:15] <MalekAlrwily> hmm
[05:57:36] <MalekAlrwily> is jquery written in js?
[05:57:39] <phoenixsun> I am having a problem with iteration in an async function. I can't get the index to match - http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=vrR583DCzc
[06:12:13] <Cork> MalekAlrwily: yes it is
[06:12:21] <MalekAlrwily> ok
[06:13:08] <clarkk> is it possible to inspect values stored using .data() via the dom?  http://api.jquery.com/data/
[06:14:20] <BinaryKitten> no
[06:14:34] <BinaryKitten> clarkk .data stores them in js data layer
[06:14:38] <BinaryKitten> that's not part of the dom
[06:14:49] <clarkk> ok, thanks BinaryKitten
[06:15:09] <BinaryKitten> .data, as a nicety will read the data-xxx attributes from dom (if you do .data('xxx') )
[06:15:38] <BinaryKitten> but if you write to it .data('xxx', 'myvalue') that will not update the dom attribute as they are different
[06:20:08] <Nomikos> on the plus side, you can store objects and even functions in there :)
[06:20:22] <Nomikos> not saying this is good practice, but..
[06:20:32] <BinaryKitten> objects i can understant.. but functions .. yowch
[06:20:33] <Cork> functions is quite common
[06:20:54] <Cork> jquery ui does it a lot
[06:21:00] <BinaryKitten> actually i can understand a use-case for both
[06:21:07] <Cork> $().data('autocomplete')._render
[06:21:24] <BinaryKitten> is autocomplete an object or a function?
[06:21:36] <Cork> _render is a function
[06:22:00] <BinaryKitten> but that's part of the autocomplete object though?
[06:22:16] <Cork> BinaryKitten: function as first or second layer
[06:22:19] <Cork> what is the difference?
[06:22:28] <Cork> anyway http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[06:22:30] <BinaryKitten> otherwise it would be .data('functionname')()
[06:22:46] <Cork> sure
[06:22:58] <BinaryKitten> Cork was referring to the data stored.. just for clarity sake and my comprehension
[06:24:44] <BinaryKitten> phoenixsun are you there?
[06:25:04] <phoenixsun> BinaryKitten: yeah I am
[06:25:20] <BinaryKitten> i'm confused with your sample with J
[06:25:51] <phoenixsun> the 'j' doesn't matter it was just a way to keep the variable sin sync
[06:25:55] <BinaryKitten> since playlist[j] won't be playlist[i]
[06:26:04] <BinaryKitten> so the id won't be the same
[06:26:15] <phoenixsun> right before i was always 13
[06:26:30] <phoenixsun> well cos there are 13 items in my playlist
[06:26:35] <BinaryKitten> see the $.each i've put in
[06:27:14] <phoenixsun> yeah a better iteration method certainly
[06:27:32] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm using the infinitescroll plugin.  The content on the page can be filtered by the user.  When the content is refreshed and the page is scrolled down, it's still AJAXing the original content.  Is there a simple way to "refresh" the infinite scroll as well or must I destroy it and build a new one?
[06:28:50] <BinaryKitten> MarcGuay which infinitescroll plugin?
[06:28:59] <BinaryKitten> because there are hundreds if not more
[06:29:01] <MarcGuay> BinaryKitten: paulirish's.
[06:40:00] <phoenixsun> BinaryKitten: It's working on. thanks!
[06:40:45] <BinaryKitten> phoenixsun np
[06:40:54] <BinaryKitten> was waiting for a response in the other window .. lol
[06:42:56] <phoenixsun> yeah multiples messengers :)
[06:46:30] <MarcGuay> Using the load() function I would like to replace <div id='test'>content</div> with <div id='test'>dynamic content</div>.
[06:47:23] <MarcGuay> If I do $('#test').load(url + '#test');  It nests it inside the existing #test div.
[06:47:56] <MarcGuay> So I end up with 2 div's with the ID of 'test'.  Suggestions on how to replace the content rather than nest it?
[06:50:06] <MarcGuay> I guess I could use get() and manipulate the data before html()ing it.
[06:55:49] <Cork> MarcGuay: 1. you should preferably only send the partial from the server
[06:56:01] <Cork> instead of sending the entire page and then filter out parts of it client side
[06:56:50] <Cork> MarcGuay: alternatively if you have to filter it client side .load adds the element(s) matching the selector in the target
[06:56:59] <Cork> so yes you will add duplicates
[06:57:09] <Cork> an option would be to do #test > *
[06:57:28] <Cork> as long as there is no text directly in the #test element
[06:57:51] <Cork> if that doesn't work, you would have to use $.get directly instead of $().load
[06:58:11] <MarcGuay> Cork: I'm looking to see if > * will work for me, thanks.
[06:58:35] <Cork> MarcGuay: know that .load('url' + ' selector') is a hack
[06:58:43] <Cork> and you REALLY should do this server side
[06:59:06] <Cork> and it should be simple to just send the partial you need in any server code
[07:20:16] <phoenixsun> BinaryKitten: after much uncertainty I have realised that the function isn't working as planned. The index is still out of sync - http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=2FiOx448bQ
[07:21:30] <BinaryKitten> phoenixsun please can you add the before and after?
[07:22:06] <phoenixsun> BinaryKitten: in jsfiddle?
[07:22:09] <BinaryKitten> yep
[07:22:24] <BinaryKitten> playlist isn't an array there
[07:23:12] <BinaryKitten> also they're not var names so need to be quoted
[07:23:23] <BinaryKitten> how are you outputting the playlist?
[07:23:58] <phoenixsun> I am viewing it in the console
[07:24:15] <BinaryKitten> whilst you're updating it phoenixsun, can you add the functions for parseForTitle and parseForArtist please
[07:24:22] <phoenixsun> ok
[07:25:09] <superjacaman> hey someone have used dataLayer?
[07:27:18] <phoenixsun> BinaryKitten: ok I think I have it all in
[07:32:06] <RhinoBoss> Is there a way to prevent disabled sortable items (or any sortable items) from being selected?
[07:40:24] <Zitter> Hi, I have var el = $("#reset-label"). Is it possible to use that el, adding a child to node as I want something like $("#reset-label .filters") ? tia
[07:42:04] <RhinoBoss> Is there a way to prevent disabled sortable items (or any sortable items) from being selected?
[07:59:57] <dmsuperman> Zitter: look at jquery.append and appendTo
[08:06:57] <airdem> http://jqueryui.com/selectable/ <-- is there a way to also unselect with the lasso?
[08:08:39] <axilla> anyone here use jqmodal?
[08:15:38] <phoenixsun> can the jquery ui autocomplete widget be styled to produced results with pic icons etc or is that extending it beyond its purpose?
[08:22:33] <ciqsteve> Q:  how do I select for   <option selected value="70">Seventy</option>
[08:22:40] <ciqsteve> if I want the 'selected' option
[08:22:49] <ciqsteve> like $(selected)
[08:23:07] <ciqsteve> ?
[08:23:07] <superjacaman> $("option:selected")
[08:23:10] <ciqsteve> ty
[08:25:15] <dmsuperman> ciqsteve: you can also do $('select.whatever').val() and that gives you the value of the selected option
[08:25:18] <dmsuperman> if that's all you care about
[08:27:39] <robertmaxrees> gooooood morning, #jquery
[08:29:58] <axilla> man there is nothing worse than when the documentation for something you really need sucks so bad...
[08:30:58] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[08:33:15] <Lehl0r> hey there
[08:33:41] <Lehl0r> got a problem with calling a function after a checkbox is selected
[08:34:23] <Lehl0r> http://pastebin.ca/2835737
[08:34:49] <ciqsteve> dmsup.. sorry, what value is 'whatever'  any selector??
[08:34:53] <Lehl0r> this is the function and all my checkboxes have the showcheck class
[08:35:01] <robertmaxrees> Lehl0r that's not a complete example...
[08:35:23] <Lehl0r> yeah i know but it should be enough
[08:35:30] <robertmaxrees> what you shared should be enough.
[08:35:34] <robertmaxrees> *to work, i mean.
[08:35:39] <robertmaxrees> which part doesn't work as expected?
[08:35:50] <Lehl0r> it doesnt work in any way
[08:36:06] <Lehl0r> so my input has checkbox has the .showcheck class
[08:36:16] <robertmaxrees> do you add the checkboxes after the page loads?
[08:36:19] <Lehl0r> <input class="showcheck"...
[08:36:25] <Lehl0r> y
[08:36:31] <Lehl0r> and the function after that
[08:36:39] <Lehl0r> so i have a loop that generates these boxes
[08:36:47] <robertmaxrees> something about that smells to me.  try using delegation instead.
[08:36:48] <Lehl0r> and after that i call the change function
[08:36:55] <robertmaxrees> that way you only bind one listener.
[08:38:10] <Lehl0r> ah ok actually you were right
[08:38:31] <Lehl0r> forgot that the function i called is an ajax call
[08:39:09] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor using delegation in most cases because of stuff like this anyway
[08:39:12] <Lehl0r> now it works after i did it after the call is complete
[08:39:54] <robertmaxrees> using $('.showcheck:checkbox').change(function() { is a bad idea in that case.
[08:40:17] <robertmaxrees> that'll attach multiple handlers to the same element every time its run.
[08:47:56] <Lehl0r> robertmaxrees well it is only called once
[08:48:06] <robertmaxrees> Lehl0r you said something about a loop and ajax.
[08:48:11] <robertmaxrees> but either way, I'd still use delegation.
[08:48:13] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[08:48:58] <Lehl0r> its called in the callback and if readystate is 4
[08:49:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:50:05] <Lehl0r> ?
[08:50:22] <robertmaxrees> if you bind the delegated listener instead, you don't have to worry about any of that.  but whatever floats your boat :)
[08:52:16] <Lehl0r> y you're right
[08:52:30] <dmsuperman> ciqsteve: It would be a selector that finds the <select> element instead of the <option>s
[08:52:57] <ciqsteve> k thanks much
[08:56:15] <grosz3q> Hi newbie need help with waypoints script is someone who want to help me?
[08:56:31] <axilla> god i'm ready to pull my hair out.
[08:56:42] <grosz3q> why ?
[08:56:44] <axilla> there isn't a single modal library out there worth a flying doo doo.
[08:57:05] <robertbusy> i personally like jqmodal,  but it has its own problems.
[08:57:11] <axilla> yea i'm using jqmodal
[08:57:14] <axilla> well switching to jqmodal
[08:57:16] <axilla> trying to.
[08:57:30] <axilla> i currently use simplemodal but i needed nested modals
[08:57:52] <axilla> in simple modal i can call my modal div.modal({options}) and it loads containers, etc
[08:58:08] <axilla> but jqmodal wants me to assign it to a div that hidden on the page.. i don't want to do that.
[08:58:19] <robertbusy> you could generate content on the fly, too.
[08:58:24] <axilla> where div = item.find('')
[08:58:27] <robertbusy> I did that a while ago.  not super clean, but it's doable.
[08:59:49] <axilla> when i try to do that jqmodal screams about o not being set or something
[09:02:55] <axilla> grr
[09:03:32] <axilla> if jqmodal had better documentation i'd be happier.
[09:07:13] <Hackwar> hi folks, I got an issue with jQuery UI. I got an existing script, which works fine on the current site. That script uses UI .buttonset() to make buttons out of radio buttons. Now that script got transfered onto a new site and there it does not work and I have not the slightest clue why. There are no JS errors. How could I troubleshoot this?
[09:07:45] <Hackwar> it also adds the ui-buttonset class to the surrounding div, but then does not do anything more...
[09:12:07] <axilla> holy shit on a shingle
[09:12:12] <axilla> i got it somewhat :)
[09:18:05] <MikeD_> parseInt( jqo.val(), 10 ) looks like it's truncating decimals, is that expected?
[09:18:59] <superjacaman> for parseInt i think so... try parseFloat
[09:19:45] <MikeD_> omg, thanks... i can't believe i missed that... i've thought of parseInt as "make sure it's a number"  for so long i'm just blind.
[09:27:57] <Hackwar> ok, so I've debugged the script a bit further and it seems as if the call to .button() simply does nothing...
[09:29:39] <ijustam> Can I use selectors on a variable, if that variable contains HTML?
[09:34:34] <jonez> greetings. I have some javascript which needs to be run after I do a .post with a fadeUp of the result. I can't figure out how to do it. the js is a click handler for a form.
[09:38:24] <jonez> I need some help with this :)
[09:39:13] <superjacaman> use the form submit and the callback on the post call
[09:39:20] <superjacaman> make the right way man =]
[09:46:13] <phoenixsun> how do you search for a substring but starting from index[0] of the string
[09:46:17] <phoenixsun> if that makes sense
[09:46:31] <phoenixsun> I am not sure the correct way to describe it
[09:47:20] <systemfault> phoenixsun: string1.indexOf(string2)
[09:47:46] <systemfault> phoenixsun: The function will return the index of string 2 if found... or -1 if it's not found.
[09:48:04] <phoenixsun> but will that not search for…say 'an' in the word 'cant'
[09:48:14] <phoenixsun> say = search
[09:49:14] <phoenixsun> systemfault: I want a situation where 'an' wont return true from "can't" but "can" will
[09:49:44] <systemfault> Then you want a regex
[09:52:29] <neredsenvy> I have multiple tables containing yes/no values:  <table><tr><td>value</td> <td>no</td></tr></table> I'm trying to hide all the tr rows whos td contain word no. I tried using $('tr td:contains("NE")') to get all tr so I could loop each of them and call .hide()
[09:52:55] <neredsenvy> However my selector is not working what am I missing
[09:54:17] <jonez> superjacaman, I don't understand
[09:54:34] <MikeD_> A jquery object with nothing selected can be returned with:  return $();   correct?
[09:55:03] <`e> $("td").each(function() { if($(this).text()=="NO") $(this).parent().hide(); });
[09:55:07] <`e> neredsenvy,
[09:55:26] <`e> go directly to the td, then find the parent
[09:55:27] <jonez> MikeD_, try it
[09:58:31] <neredsenvy> `e: I get nothing when I call $('td:contains("NE")'); when it should return an array of some 20 objects
[09:58:49] <neredsenvy> well returns object but length 0
[09:59:09] <systemfault> You want 'no' but write "NE" ?
[09:59:25] <neredsenvy> in my own language sorry
[09:59:47] <`e> neredsenvy, I wrote you a possible solution, so try it.
[10:00:17] <neredsenvy> sorry it was selector problem
[10:00:21] <neredsenvy> was Ne not NE
[10:00:24] <neredsenvy> -.-
[10:00:26] <neredsenvy> works now
[10:00:37] <`e> ... can I say "idiot"?
[10:00:41] <`e> :)
[10:01:28] <ejb> Hi, I have this problem where I need to attach an element to the dom, manipulate it, then return its markup from a function (handlebars.js helper). How can I attach, detach, and get the markup?
[10:01:36] <jenia> hello. how do you change the value inside a label?
[10:02:34] <ejb> Sorry, I need to attach it, manipulate it, detach, and return the markup
[10:02:48] <neredsenvy> I'll allow it
[10:02:49] <neredsenvy> xD
[10:03:03] <systemfault> ejb: Why do you need to "attach it"?
[10:03:17] <systemfault> ejb: Just create a fragment, manipulate it and get the markup
[10:03:55] <ejb> systemfault: what's a fragment? It seems that the plugin I'm using (tagsinput) needs to work with an input that exists in the DOM?
[10:04:15] <systemfault> ejb: Why do you want to "get" the markup?
[10:04:45] <systemfault> A fragment is a piece of a DOM tree that is detached from the main DOM tree
[10:05:01] <ejb> Because I'm creating a handlebars helper to insert the input
[10:07:59] <jonez> superjacaman, the trouble is that after the .post, the form is sometimes displayed again, and the click handler doesn't get set up a 2nd time
[10:08:03] <ejb> systemfault: it's all a bit hacky because I'm working with meteor
[10:08:12] <ejb> systemfault: but do you understand the problem?
[10:08:21] <systemfault> No, sorry...
[10:08:43] <superjacaman> what? i didn't get sorry.
[10:08:51] <ejb> systemfault: Are you familiar with handlebars?
[10:09:14] <systemfault> Yes
[10:10:49] <jonez> superjacaman, I need to set up an on click handler *after* I do a .post
[10:11:02] <jonez> the handler I have works great, but only once.
[10:11:03] <ejb> systemfault: So I have a helper that I use like this: {{tagsInput myTags}}. In this helper, I need to create an input, initialize it with tagsinput(), add each tag from myTags, and return the resulting markup.
[10:11:22] <ejb> systemfault: http://timschlechter.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/
[10:11:57] <superjacaman> can i see the code?
[10:12:38] <ejb> systemfault: What complicates this, I believe, is that I can't add myTags to the input unless it's attached to the DOM
[10:13:38] <jonez> superjacaman, ya hold on
[10:13:40] <ejb> systemfault: this is as close as I got: http://pastebin.com/cTQrKjjW
[10:14:42] <systemfault> Looks fine.
[10:16:56] <jonez> superjacaman, http://hashjquery.privatepaste.com/6aba4530c4
[10:17:33] <ejb> systemfault: I know what's happening... tagsinput is adding other elements besides the input and those are getting left behind
[10:18:31] <kanzie> Im using the accordion and when upgrading from 1.9 to 1.11 suddenly each expand adds a height of something like 1400px to the container element
[10:18:37] <kanzie> is this a known bug or what can I do about it
[10:20:36] <jonez> kanzie, see if you can reproduce it with a very small amount of code
[10:20:59] <jonez> kanzie, stripping out all of your css etc
[10:21:47] <kanzie> quite surely this would not show the symptom… I believe it is something messed up with all the bulk of code around it. Is there a good way to retain the jqueryui css that I have made with themeroller while upgrading to later version of jqueryui?
[10:21:52] <kanzie> maybe that is the problem?
[10:22:46] <jonez> your first question was if this is a known bug. looks like if you can't reproduce it without your custom css, the problem is with your custom css
[10:22:51] <kanzie> jonez: removing the jqueryui css did nothing to fix the problem however
[10:23:54] <jonez> you could try to find change logs between 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11. I would certainly strip out the custom theme and try again to confirm. then re-roll your theme using the newest version
[10:25:52] <nahtnam> Hey! I have a really newbie question.
[10:26:16] <nahtnam> How do I make it so that when someone types something in the textbox, the text shows up underneath it?
[10:26:21] <nahtnam> dynamically
[10:26:49] <jonez> nahtnam, like google suggestions?
[10:27:28] <nahtnam> jonez: Sort of. Basically when someone types their username in the textbox, underneath it it will say "http://domain.com/user/<username>"
[10:27:38] <nahtnam> I used to be able to do this in ember really easily
[10:27:42] <jonez> ok hmm
[10:27:56] <jonez> you could trap the keypress event and go from there
[10:28:00] <nahtnam> jonez: If you go to http://emberjs.com/
[10:28:04] <nahtnam> and scroll down
[10:28:12] <nahtnam> you can see the "my name is" application
[10:28:17] <nahtnam> thats what I want to do in jquery/js
[10:30:01] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam bind to the keypress event of the input and replace the contents of a span with the value of said input.
[10:30:20] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: I tried doing onkeyup but it wont work.
[10:30:36] <robertmaxrees> keypress
[10:30:37] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/nahtnam/445c4a6c230c69503eaa
[10:30:48] <jonez> we have both told you keypress not keyup :)
[10:31:50] <nahtnam> Ohhh
[10:31:51] <nahtnam> sorry
[10:32:28] <robertmaxrees> or .on('keypress, function() {});
[10:32:33] <jonez> superjacaman, any ideas?
[10:32:44] <nahtnam> Still nothing. https://gist.github.com/nahtnam/a0118af464b3c9c9df95
[10:32:52] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o0325aq6/
[10:32:54] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[10:32:57] <nahtnam> Am i supposed to put this in dicument.read?
[10:32:59] <nahtnam> *ready
[10:33:08] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam document ready or after your HTML.
[10:33:11] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[10:33:42] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: Ohhh thats what I was missing :P
[10:33:43] <nahtnam> Sorry
[10:35:06] <nahtnam> It works! :)
[10:35:26] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[10:37:07] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: Slightly different quesion. How can I make it if there is no text, the "http://domain.com/user/"
[10:37:09] <nahtnam> dissappers?
[10:37:28] <robertmaxrees> the what now?
[10:37:33] <robertmaxrees> (update the fiddle with what you have)
[10:38:09] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/odkm45tr/
[10:38:20] <nahtnam> How can I make it so that if there is no text, the http part goes away?
[10:38:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't see an http part >.>
[10:38:47] <robertmaxrees> click "update".
[10:38:56] <robertmaxrees> and share the link again.
[10:39:22] <jonez> I think he wants to take the value of an input box and append it to part of a url
[10:39:44] <jonez> when the text input box is empty (check length) you can set the span to have whatever value you want
[10:40:20] <superjacaman> jonez no man sorry =[
[10:40:34] <jonez> superjacaman, drat
[10:40:39] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/odkm45tr/1/
[10:40:43] <nahtnam> sorry
[10:40:54] <nahtnam> I rarely use jsfiddle
[10:40:57] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam it's cool.  check the .val().
[10:41:02] <robertmaxrees> like I said.
[10:41:09] <jonez> what is the standard way to check to see if a click event has been bound?
[10:41:21] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: so if val = null then hide?
[10:41:23] <jonez> hrmm.. the 'onclick' attribute?
[10:41:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:41:37] <robertmaxrees> jonez why are you checking.
[10:41:42] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam .val().length
[10:41:45] <robertmaxrees> or .val() === ''
[10:41:50] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: kk
[10:41:51] <nahtnam> thanks
[10:41:52] <robertmaxrees> it won't be null.
[10:42:14] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam also get that URL into another span with an id OR include it in the current span.
[10:42:16] <jonez> robertmaxrees, because it doesn't work right when the form is displayed a 2nd time (form did not validate)
[10:42:29] <robertmaxrees> jonez event delegation.
[10:44:52] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/odkm45tr/2/ ???
[10:45:06] <nahtnam> oh nvm
[10:45:08] <nahtnam> forgot ()
[10:45:18] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam you want that check in the handler, as well.
[10:45:57] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: This is buggy as hell. http://jsfiddle.net/odkm45tr/4/
[10:46:16] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam right, because you're not checking inside the keyup as well.
[10:47:09] <nahtnam> ahh kk
[10:47:31] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to just .show() always - check the length of the value and hide/show as appropriate.
[10:48:42] <jonez> robertmaxrees, that is a step in the right direction :) ty ... is the 2nd param to on() allowed to be any valid selector?
[10:48:44] <Zzaichik> If I'm explicitly setting the height of an element to 0 in the css, Is there a way I can get the true height of that element in jquery
[10:48:55] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: YAY! http://jsfiddle.net/odkm45tr/6/ is there anything I can do to make it better?
[10:48:58] <robertmaxrees> jonez yes - the docs tell you as much :)
[10:49:05] <Zzaichik> .outerheight() and height() both return 0 as expected.
[10:49:10] <jonez> robbyoconnor, I read about it on jquery.com just now
[10:49:30] <dmsuperman> nahtnam: you could write it in perl
[10:49:33] <dmsuperman> bah dum tsssh
[10:49:44] <nahtnam> hahaha?
[10:49:49] <nahtnam> i dont get it
[10:49:54] <dmsuperman> what are you asking for?
[10:50:04] <dmsuperman> I was making a joke that you weren't really asking a question
[10:50:12] <nahtnam> dmsuperman: I was wondering if I can make that code a little better and less buggy
[10:50:16] <dmsuperman> what's buggy about it?
[10:50:25] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam you're still not doing what i said...
[10:50:29] <nahtnam> dmsuperman: enter "a" and then press backspace
[10:50:38] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: I dont understand what you are saying :(
[10:51:07] <dmsuperman> use keyup to fix that
[10:51:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/odkm45tr/7
[10:51:17] <dmsuperman> or both
[10:51:57] <dmsuperman> I wonder if you can pass a conditional to toggle
[10:52:10] <nahtnam> robertmaxrees: Oh so you wanted an else condition too?
[10:52:13] <nahtnam> *wanted me to put
[10:52:31] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam how else would you hide/show something conditionally? ;)
[10:52:38] <dmsuperman> ah you can, nice. I would do that like this:  $('#link').toggle($('#username').val().length === 0)
[10:52:47] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do it that way personally, but meh.
[10:52:54] <dmsuperman> how come?
[10:53:05] <dmsuperman> I would only do the if/else if I planned to put more code in the show/hide snippets
[10:53:05] <nahtnam> dmsuperman: I hate one liners. they become hard to see/understand :P
[10:53:19] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer more explicit paths.
[10:53:23] <dmsuperman> gotchya
[10:53:26] <robertmaxrees> don't run jquery methods unless i need to, etc.
[10:53:45] <dmsuperman> It wouldn't run any extra methods though no? I get the explicit paths thing
[10:53:45] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam you could also cache your selectors, as well, instead of running them over and over.
[10:53:49] <dmsuperman> but I think code-wise they're identical?
[10:54:02] <robertmaxrees> your code runs .toggle() always.
[10:54:09] <robertmaxrees> mind only calls hide/show() if needed.
[10:54:14] <dmsuperman> ah, I guess
[10:54:16] <robertmaxrees> functionally they accomplish the same thing.
[10:54:26] <robertmaxrees> but one avoids an entire step through the jquery object.
[10:54:37] <dmsuperman> My approach is if performance is so poor that saving a single call like that will make a difference I have bigger problems to fix
[10:54:47] <dmsuperman> but I do see your point
[10:55:15] <robertmaxrees> i do lots of smalelr thigns up front to avoid it later.
[10:56:54] <phoenixsun> is there something like the big page of regex examples?
[10:57:38] <systemfault> phoenixsun: When I need to deal with them... I use this page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[10:57:47] <systemfault> And play with my JS console
[10:58:06] <phoenixsun> I am on that page and doing a lot of playing in the console already lol
[10:58:13] <robertmaxrees> nahtnam taken a step further: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/odkm45tr/8/
[10:58:27] <dmsuperman> I like this resource phoenixsun http://regularexpressions.info/
[10:58:56] <phoenixsun> dmsuperman: thanks
[11:14:10] <Zzaichik> If I'm explicitly setting the height of an element to 0 in the css, Is there a way I can get the true height of that element in jquery
[11:15:27] <il> how can I merge duplicate objects in an array of objects?
[11:16:40] <robertbusy> Zzaichik .height() is the computed height, iirc.
[11:16:47] <robertbusy> which sounds like what you want.
[11:17:34] <Zzaichik> hmm
[11:17:36] <amh345> what's the most concise way in query to say var array = [] unless some_Cookie_is_present ?
[11:17:43] <amh345> jquery *
[11:18:08] <robertmaxrees> amh345 hrm?
[11:18:19] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik what exactly are you trying to accomplishj?
[11:19:24] <amh345> robertmaxrees: I'm working on a shopping cart. and when the user first visits i set var cart = []   then i add to this array as the user adds products and store it to a cookie.
[11:19:45] <dmsuperman> Zzaichik: the true height would be 0 in that case
[11:19:45] <robertmaxrees> you could use a ternary.
[11:19:47] <amh345> I'm trying to find a nice way to set var cart to the cookie, if the cookie is there.
[11:19:54] <amh345> yeah. just checking the ternary now.
[11:20:08] <robertmaxrees> what doexs the coodie thinger return if it's not there?
[11:20:19] <robertmaxrees> because you could also do var cart = cookie('cart') || [];
[11:20:22] <Zzaichik> dmsuperman: right, that's my problem
[11:20:39] <robertmaxrees> Zzaichik are you trying to get the height without the CSS? ooorrrr...?
[11:20:45] <Zzaichik> yes
[11:20:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to get it before you set the css then.
[11:21:01] <dmsuperman> you could grab the height before applying the rule
[11:21:03] <Zzaichik> I'm trying to animate an element to it's custom height
[11:21:20] <Zzaichik> that's a good idea. I'll try that
[11:21:37] <dmsuperman> if not that you'll probably have to specify the "desired final height" via something else than just the CSS
[11:21:48] <robertmaxrees> you could also attach a data attribute to the node with the destination height.  or a max-height
[11:22:35] <amh345> robertmaxrees: the || did the trick.
[11:22:38] <amh345> thanks
[11:22:40] <robertmaxrees> amh345 sure
[11:22:46] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I've been using this following boilerplate for my jQuery JS files for quite a while. I usually include my <script> tags at the end of a document but now I need to include them at the top. I'm seeing some strange behaviour of events being defined in the DOM but not taking place unless I place the script tag at the bottom of my file. Anybody know what's up? - https://pastee.org/j36yx
[11:22:53] <robertmaxrees> amh345 if this is for a cart though you might want to handle that in your backend.
[11:22:55] <DeltaHeavy> Should I just use $(document).ready?
[11:23:12] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy that code doesn't do document ready for you.
[11:23:19] <robertmaxrees> adding document ready should resolve that problem for you.
[11:23:20] <amh345> robertmaxrees: i have server side processes that are verifying as well.
[11:23:36] <amh345> I'm testing out ways to reduce server load.
[11:23:36] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Is there any way to get the advantages of what I'm doing, and have it called on $(document).ready?
[11:23:48] <amh345> so I'm rewiring a few things here and there to check how it handles performance.
[11:24:01] <Zzaichik> dmsuperman: thanks man
[11:24:08] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy why are you doing what you're doing in the first place?
[11:24:43] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: TBH I saw it in a bunch of code Google made and I've been doing it ever since. It ensures $ = jQuery and undefined = undefined.
[11:24:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:25:09] <DeltaHeavy> Guess it doesn't really matter in this specific project. I should just learn how to modularize better.
[11:25:11] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks!
[11:25:15] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i know why somebody would use that, but I'm curious why you yourself are using it.
[11:25:43] <robertmaxrees> you can also do this: https://pastee.org/yjf7
[11:26:03] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I think I'll do that. Thanks!
[11:26:25] <robertmaxrees> i rarely use that IIFE personally - if something is mucking with undefined, i have other problems :)
[11:27:07] <DeltaHeavy> Kinda feels like overkill right now. Think I"ll just stop doing this unless i'm making modules and stuff.
[11:27:39] <dmsuperman> undefined gets mucked with?
[11:27:52] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman it can, yeah.
[11:28:06] <dmsuperman> >> undefined = 'a'; undefined;
[11:28:12] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined
[11:28:27] <robertmaxrees> "Since undefined is not a reserved word, it can be used as an identifier (variable name) in any scope other than the global scope."
[11:28:50] <dmsuperman> oh weird, wonder why it's not reserved
[11:31:14] <robertmaxrees> shapeshed.com/the-void-of-undefined-in-javascript/ for some info.
[11:31:18] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty... special.
[11:32:32] <decx> like i'm going to copy AND paste? no sir !
[11:32:42] <robertmaxrees> pfffff
[11:33:06] <Uhkis> copy paste what?
[11:33:12] <robertmaxrees> my URL.
[11:33:24] <robertmaxrees> it didn't have http:// in front of it, which means a lot of clients didn't autolink it.
[11:33:26] <robertmaxrees> also: http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/understanding-undefined-and-preventing-referenceerrors/
[11:33:26] <Uhkis> better clients made that clickable just fine ;-)
[11:34:20] <dmsuperman> shitty clients!
[11:34:29] <dmsuperman> iTerm2 did it just fine
[11:34:32] <xxx1337> how come this code just doesn't seem to run on IE9? http://pastebin.com/ME3TYvGG
[11:34:45] <robertmaxrees> why do people still use pastebin?
[11:35:05] <dmsuperman> why do people still submit bug reports with "doesn't work"?
[11:35:06] <dmsuperman> :P
[11:35:28] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 what "doesn't work"?
[11:35:33] <robertmaxrees> do you get any console errors?
[11:35:40] <Uhkis> and use functions you can't see code from
[11:36:14] <xxx1337> ie9 doesnt have built in dev tools
[11:36:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah, can you replace chkForm(); with console.log('test'); and see that work fine?
[11:36:18] <xxx1337> can't see any console errors
[11:36:21] <robertmaxrees> yes it does.
[11:37:08] <Uhkis> there's always good old alert()
[11:37:11] <robertmaxrees> hell, even 8 has a console.
[11:37:43] <robertmaxrees> long-held misconception.  the reason you avoid leaving console.log() for old IE is the object doesn't exist if the console isn't open.
[11:37:57] <dmsuperman> and I've used firebug lite as far back as IE6, maybe 5.5 even
[11:38:40] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/4YfjEgl.png <- IE8 VM with dev tools open.  bam.
[11:38:45] <xxx1337> ok so the code seems to be running but returning false is supposed to make the form not submit when the user hits submit
[11:38:47] <dmsuperman> lol
[11:38:57] <xxx1337> but on ie9 the form submits anyway
[11:38:57] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 don't do it that way.
[11:38:57] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: remove chkForm();
[11:39:00] <robertmaxrees> pass the event object.
[11:39:11] <robertmaxrees> then run preventDefault() against it instead.
[11:39:18] <dmsuperman> well that too. but remove your code and make it just so it return false / event.preventDefault()
[11:39:21] <dmsuperman> I bet it works fine
[11:39:32] <robertmaxrees> $('#someForm').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[11:39:36] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunchtime.
[11:39:38] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks/.
[11:40:18] <xxx1337> oh... i know why this is happening
[11:40:26] <xxx1337> i'm using a placeholder text plugin for ie 9
[11:40:35] <xxx1337> and it actually has values for the input fields
[11:40:41] <xxx1337> because its not actually placeholder text
[11:40:53] <xxx1337> thanks for the troubleshooting guys
[11:40:57] <dmsuperman> so it turns out the code you linked us worked all along!
[11:40:58] <dmsuperman> lol
[11:55:28] <jonez> greetings. I changed my code a bit to use event delegation.. however my click handler only gets called once.
[11:57:41] <AlexR2> jones, can you show some code?
[11:58:06] <xxx1337> after some trouble shooting i figured out it's actually this line causing issues in ie9
[11:58:07] <xxx1337> document.forms["form_877936"]["element_10"].classList.remove("invalidBorder");
[11:58:09] <jonez> AlexR2, ya. http://jsfiddle.net/9pv0uLtz/
[11:58:19] <xxx1337> for some reason ie9 doesn't want to run any code after that line?
[11:58:58] <xxx1337> googling it says "This has poor cross-browser support. Internet Explorer doesn't support it in any version prior to 10."
[11:59:00] <dmsuperman> I suspect there is no Array.remove in IE9 xxx	
[11:59:20] <xxx1337> what should i do -x
[11:59:23] <xxx1337> ..
[11:59:42] <dmsuperman> well for one, jquery has trivial code to accomplish this
[11:59:46] <dmsuperman> not sure why you're asking vanilla JS questions in #jquery
[11:59:50] <dmsuperman> :P
[12:00:09] <dmsuperman> check out jquery.removeClass
[12:00:40] <AlexR2> jonez: that all looks fine, any chance you are replacing that element at some point?
[12:01:11] <jonez> AlexR2, yes. the processpage() method fades out the <body> and fades up new content
[12:01:21] <jonez> AlexR2, perhaps I should bind to <body> instead?
[12:01:36] <AlexR2> that or rebind the event
[12:01:38] <AlexR2> up to you
[12:01:39] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: dude just look up jquery.removeClass
[12:01:52] <dmsuperman> you're already using jquery no?
[12:02:16] <jonez> AlexR2, how do I rebind it?
[12:02:30] <AlexR2> just call your function again
[12:02:39] <jonez> AlexR2, I thought that is what event delegation was for
[12:03:22] <dmsuperman> jonez didn't we already go over the fact that you shouldn't really be replacing the entire <body> like that? :P
[12:03:35] <dmsuperman> use a div that takes up the entire window
[12:03:51] <AlexR2> your function is binding an on click event  to the $("form") object.  if you replace that object, there's nothing bound to the new one unless you bind it again
[12:03:52] <jonez> we went over how I should never ever use document.write :)
[12:04:09] <dmsuperman> well that was one topic as well
[12:04:14] <jonez> oh
[12:04:45] <jonez> AlexR2, now I get it re: binding to objects that get replaced
[12:05:04] <meowsus> I am curious, say there is a $.addClass inside of a mousemove event. Does that method edit immediately if that class exists already?
[12:05:50] <dmsuperman> addClass won't modify the node if it already contains the given class
[12:06:19] <meowsus> So using $.addClass inside a mousemove is only as memory intensive as the lookup to see if that class exists.
[12:06:23] <meowsus> Hypothetically.
[12:06:48] <dmsuperman> here's the addClass method meowsus  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/10399ddcf8a239acc27bdec9231b996b178224d3/src/attributes/classes.js#L11
[12:07:05] <meowsus> Duh. Why didn't I just look there myself
[12:07:07] <meowsus> Thanks dmsuperman
[12:07:16] <dmsuperman> np
[12:07:20] <jonez> w0000t! binding to "click" on <body> solved my bug.
[12:07:24] <jonez> ty
[12:07:47] <dmsuperman> now you just need to stop replacing the whole body :P
[12:07:51] <dmsuperman> as we discussed
[12:09:04] <jonez> dmsuperman, if I could think of a way to do that that gracefully degrades wo js available, I'm all for it.
[12:09:33] <dmsuperman> for like the third time, use a div that is the full size of the window
[12:09:41] <dmsuperman> boom
[12:15:39] <John3k> i am switching content on my site using http://website.com/index.html#section1 / ..#section2 ../ section3
[12:15:49] <John3k> is there any way i can figure out which one is active with jquery?
[12:16:17] <BinaryKitten> var active = $('#' + window.location.hash);
[12:20:33] <RhinoBoss> How do you enable jquery buttons once they are disabled? See this simple broken example: http://jsfiddle.net/sqkhdr66/3/

[12:35:51] <jimi_> .on monitors future elements not attached to the dom yet after creation correct?
[12:35:57] <robertmaxrees> it can
[12:36:01] <robertmaxrees> if you use delegated syntax
[12:36:36] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[12:37:02] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, what about something like this ? http://pastie.org/private/veajcebdbwrrdyhk9xjyha
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:37:24] <robertmaxrees> you have to supply the second arg.
[12:37:33] <robertmaxrees> what's up with the .off() use in there?
[12:38:15] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, was testing something but it didn't work
[12:38:23] <jimi_> wanted to see if it was cause it was already bound
[12:38:23] <robertmaxrees> use delegated listeners.
[12:38:30] <robertmaxrees> attach once.
[12:38:36] <robertmaxrees> and get rid of the propagation prevention.
[12:39:38] <jimi_> so the parent would be like $(document).on(touchClickEventName,'.message-file', function() {});
[12:39:39] <jimi_> ?
[12:39:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd bind further down than document if you can, but yeah.
[13:27:02] <John3k> why do i get undefined as a result of var $jQ = $.noConflict(true); alert($jQ(this).attr("href"));
[13:28:04] <robertmaxrees> because that's not how you change the jquery variable name?
[13:28:10] <robertmaxrees> oh wait.
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can do it that way.
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> what is this supposed to be?
[13:30:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean the object `this`
[13:31:02] <John3k> i though i can get the actual link with that function
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> is that alert inside of an on click?
[13:31:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see more code, basically.
[13:31:37] <John3k> yes it is
[13:31:57] <John3k> i am figuring that this is not the problem i have here :/ damnit
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nL6xcuqw/
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[13:32:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see more of your code :)
[13:33:35] <John3k> oh yes seems work fine
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> also use prop instead of attr.
[13:34:28] <John3k> ok
[13:36:05] <John3k> oh ok the problem is that i am looking for #home in the link
[13:36:19] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[13:36:40] <John3k> when i am on index.html#contact for example and go back to index.html#home then i need to show the alert
[13:36:50] <John3k> basically :)
[13:36:55] <robertmaxrees> why not a console log?
[13:37:04] <robertmaxrees> and detect when the hash in the URL changes instead.
[13:37:09] <John3k> well, an alert stands for some stuff i will do then
[13:37:25] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('hashchange', function() {});
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> bam
[13:37:45] <John3k> phew wow
[13:37:56] <John3k> thanks
[13:44:20] <John3k> hm, how do i use this
[13:45:11] <John3k> http://pastebin.com/xwEWYsbC
[13:46:33] <John3k> oh, have to use it without jquery
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the document ready in there btw.
[13:48:14] <robertmaxrees> and use .on('hashchange', function() {});
[13:49:16] <John3k> .one?
[13:49:19] <John3k> .on ?
[13:49:21] <robertmaxrees> .on
[13:49:29] <John3k> without anything else ?
[13:49:41] <robertmaxrees> i showed you exactly what to do earlier lol
[13:49:47] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('hashchange', function() {});
[13:49:50] <dmsuperman> lol
[13:49:53] <John3k> sorry man ;)
[13:50:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gabggon4/
[13:50:10] <John3k> i appreciate your patience
[13:50:29] <robertmaxrees> no need for document ready in that case either since window is already there.  have you checked out the tutorial on learn.jquery.com?
[13:50:30] <John3k> looking good now, ty
[13:50:40] <John3k> i haven't
[13:50:54] <robertmaxrees> might be a good idea :)
[13:51:50] <John3k> i guess
[13:55:42] <robertmaxrees> $parent = $thing.parents('.a-navbar').first(); this sorta stuff makes me sad.
[13:57:04] <jftf> is it possible to .find children within children? a la $('#target').find('figcaption .image-credit')
[13:57:05] <jftf> ?
[13:57:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:57:24] <jftf> coo
[13:57:25] <robertmaxrees> .find() looks for any descendants that match that selector.
[13:57:27] <robertmaxrees> just like CSS would.
[13:57:30] <jftf> nice
[14:06:58] <John3k> hm, i have a button which is positioned absolute bottom: 3% and 80px height. Now i would like to move it out of the visible area with .animate marginBottom:.. but how do i add up 80px plus 3%
[14:07:18] <robertmaxrees> John3k i'd ask in #css :)
[14:07:19] <John3k> 'marginBottom' : -("3%" + "120px") -> something like that or convert the 3% into px
[14:07:41] <John3k> will do that
[14:12:50] <dmsuperman> John3k: you could calculate the parent height to determine what it's 3% of
[14:13:34] <John3k> i'd need to do that since its dynamic
[14:13:44] <John3k> well, maybe i will position the button by px and not by %
[14:13:53] <John3k> that would make life easier :)
[14:14:01] <dmsuperman> If you just want to move it out of the visible area why not set it to top: 10000000 ?
[14:14:25] <John3k> because iam animatin it
[14:14:56] <John3k> and top: 1000000 wouldnt let you see an animation, well it would if you set a very long time
[14:15:01] <John3k> duration time*
[14:15:02] <John3k> ;)
[14:15:57] <alexw> What's the best charting API?
[14:16:06] <alexw> I want it to be easy to pull from an ajax source
[14:17:33] <NoiseEee> alexw: API?
[14:17:42] <alexw> Library
[14:17:49] <alexw> Chart.js / High charts
[14:17:52] <NoiseEee> alexw: as far as libraries go, http://d3js.org/ and http://www.highcharts.com/ are good
[14:19:20] <alexw> I want to show about 10-15 charts on a single page
[14:19:24] <alexw> All pulled in using ajax
[14:20:26] <robertmaxrees> highcharts can do that.
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> new relic uses a TON of charts and they use highcharts for everything.
[14:22:18] <NoiseEee> 'all pulled in using ajax'
[14:22:35] <alexw> great
[14:22:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:22:47] <NoiseEee> i assume that means 'chart data coming in via ajax' and then using <lib> to render it (in multiple ways)
[14:23:03] <alexw> If it wasn't done through ajax page load would take forever
[14:23:12] <alexw> That's corret
[14:23:14] <alexw> correct*
[14:23:19] <alexw> Data source will be ajax
[14:23:34] * NoiseEee shrugs
[14:23:36] <voronika> I just built out a chart using google charts.  simple, but it did the job.  if you have the budget, highcharts is nice though.
[14:23:39] <NoiseEee> either way the data has to get there, alexw
[14:23:45] <alexw> The thing is with 15 or so charts how do I KISS
[14:24:14] <NoiseEee> you can also load the data on page load and hide it in a JS object to be accessed, assuming your chart data is actually always the same... otherwise yes xhr
[14:24:31] <alexw> NoiseEee
[14:24:37] <alexw> The issue is some queries take 1-2 seconds
[14:24:43] <alexw> So I want it to be running in paralell
[14:24:50] <NoiseEee> $someChartLibrary.use(myData);  var oneChart = $someChartLibrary.render('bar');  var twoChart = $someChartLibar.render('pie')  etc
[14:24:54] <alexw> Hence the reasoning for ajax
[14:25:09] <alexw> Similar to http://laravel-charts.gopagoda.com/
[14:25:23] <NoiseEee> sounds good alexw
[14:50:25] <Rudeboy> Can anyone please tell me why ie8 doesn't work with my JSON function?
[14:50:26] <Rudeboy> http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/158929/filter-second-dropdown-tax-based-on-first-dropdown-cpt
[14:51:15] <robertmaxrees> do you get any console errors?
[14:52:51] <dmsuperman> I want to make a bot that autokicks anybody who says "doesn't work"
[14:52:53] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Quite a few "object not expected" errors
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman yeah...
[14:53:34] <robertmaxrees> Rudeboy hard to know without seeing your data.
[14:54:22] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: I also get jQuery is undefined. Though it works on every other browser
[14:54:50] <Rudeboy> dmsuperman: I want to make a bot the eliminates every trace of ie from this planet
[14:55:29] <dmsuperman> well I certainly wouldn't be opposed to that
[14:55:43] <dmsuperman> but jquery is undefined sounds like PEBKAC
[14:55:52] <Rudeboy> dmsuperman: What's that?
[14:56:49] <dmsuperman> Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair
[14:57:00] <robertmaxrees> i rarely have issues with IE these days personally.
[14:57:01] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[14:57:10] <robertmaxrees> Rudeboy what version of JQ are you using?
[14:57:17] <Rudeboy> dmsuperman: Ha ha ha ha ha :)
[14:57:39] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Well, using Wordpress, so which ever version comes with that
[14:58:08] <robertmaxrees> go to the console and type $.fn.jquery
[14:58:15] <robertmaxrees> should return a string with the version number.
[14:59:06] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Oh cool:) It's version 2.1.1
[14:59:28] <robertmaxrees> that would be why.
[14:59:36] <robertmaxrees> the 2.x series drops support for IE8 and below.
[14:59:44] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Ha ha ha seriously?
[14:59:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:59:51] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/download/
[15:00:04] <Rudeboy> So er....must I load a specific one for ie8 and below then?
[15:00:06] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.1 and 2.1.1 are both the exact same set of features otherwise.
[15:00:08] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:00:28] <robertmaxrees> the 1.x series keeps support for 6, 7, and 8.
[15:00:32] <robertmaxrees> the 2.x series drops it.
[15:00:44] <robertmaxrees> use one or the other.
[15:00:47] <sanman> hi, I want to use the .On() function but it doesn't work
[15:00:57] <robertmaxrees> sanman not enough detail ;)
[15:01:05] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ sanman
[15:01:05] <b-ot> sanman: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:01:23] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: But will I not lose features if I downgrade? Can't I just load an old version just for Satan's browser?
[15:01:40] <robertmaxrees> Rudeboy again - it's not a downgrade.
[15:01:50] <robertmaxrees> 1.11.1 and 2.1.1 contain the exact same set of features.
[15:01:59] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Then what it the difference?
[15:02:08] <robertmaxrees> the only difference is the 2.x series drops support for IE 6, 7, and 8.
[15:02:25] <robertmaxrees> i said as much twice already lol
[15:02:39] <synapt> Is there any particular reason why $.parseJSON($('#foobar').text()) 'breaks' as if it's parsing literal " characters, despite the content of #foobar being html entitied?
[15:02:49] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: So why would anyone possibly want to use the later version then? That doesn't make sense
[15:02:57] <sanman> this.header.on('click',function () {alert("MAKE CLICKABLE! "+_self.robotState.guid);}
[15:03:02] <synapt> I can understand why $('#foobar').html() might reverse the encoding, but why would .text() not keep the &quot;'s?
[15:03:05] <sanman> shouldn't this work?
[15:03:08] <synapt> (latest jQuery btw)
[15:03:13] <robertmaxrees> Rudeboy because lots of folks don't need to support those browsers.
[15:03:29] <sanman> this.header.on('click',function () {alert("MAKE CLICKABLE! ");}
[15:03:41] <robertmaxrees> sanman what is this.header in that context?
[15:03:43] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: I know, but if the new version adds nothing new, why not just keep the old version AND support for older browsers?
[15:03:46] <robertmaxrees> and is that a jquery object?
[15:03:55] <robertmaxrees> Rudeboy smaller filesize.
[15:03:59] <robertmaxrees> and slightly faster execution.
[15:04:04] <robertmaxrees> and it's not "new version.
[15:04:10] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Oh, ok :)
[15:04:12] <robertmaxrees> it's developed in tandem.
[15:04:21] <sanman> this.header is the a jquery object
[15:04:29] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Well, thanks so much for explaining why it's not working :)
[15:04:34] <robertmaxrees> Rudeboy of course.
[15:04:45] <robertmaxrees> sanman dunno then.  i'd need to see a fiddle of your code.
[15:09:17] <Rudeboy> robertmaxrees: Cool, it's working now...kind of. Just loads a blank dropdown though
[15:10:20] <ruibrito> hey guys could you help me out with something related to javascript arrays and JSON?? I'm completed stuck and about to go crazy
[15:10:34] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito deffo - just ask :)
[15:11:19] <ruibrito> well i have this json array with objects inside, but i dont always receive the same elements
[15:11:36] <ruibrito> so doing something like service[0].name
[15:11:38] <robertmaxrees> mmk.  can you paste your code in a fiddle?
[15:11:45] <robertmaxrees> or explain why the indexes might change?
[15:11:46] <ruibrito> yeah sure
[15:11:47] <ruibrito> http://jsfiddle.net/ruibritopt/vjq0rk0v/
[15:12:01] <ruibrito> i have a expected result there
[15:12:35] <robertmaxrees> btw be careful with math in javascript ;)
[15:12:46] <robertmaxrees> anyway - so what's the issue you're having?
[15:13:17] <ruibrito> math? ok my issue is that i first iterate over all my indexes in the array
[15:13:25] <ruibrito> and then get the element in that index
[15:13:32] <ruibrito> now i am only working in the element
[15:13:42] <ruibrito> and so, I want to sum and the rice together
[15:13:57] <robertmaxrees> "sum and the rice together" with what?
[15:13:59] <ruibrito> but I am not sure  - before hand - if rice is going to be in there
[15:14:03] <robertmaxrees> also, can you change how the data is formatted?
[15:14:19] <robertmaxrees> because there are a few things you can do here to make this wicked easy.
[15:14:31] <ruibrito> i can change everything if i want, if you have a better design for that information i appreciate
[15:14:53] <ruibrito> i want to sum all the rices, to answer your previous questions
[15:15:10] <robertmaxrees> mmk - first off, why not make receipt a vanilla object whose properties are named for the months?
[15:15:14] <synapt> So no answer to my question?  lol
[15:15:30] <robertmaxrees> synapt sorry, what was it?
[15:15:45] <synapt> <synapt> Is there any particular reason why $.parseJSON($('#foobar').text()) 'breaks' as if it's parsing literal " characters, despite the content of #foobar being html entitied?
[15:15:47] <ruibrito> sorry to cut in synapt, you go first
[15:15:58] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito i can do both at once ;)
[15:16:06] <robertmaxrees> synapt can you show me what the data looks like?
[15:17:06] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito so yeah, my first thing would be to find some other way to organize your data.  to more directly answer your question, one sec.
[15:17:22] <synapt> robertmaxrees: it's basically just; {"title":"Googled &quot;Who's a good boy&quot; - was not disappointed","item_id":"108635","prev_id":"108640","next_id":"108618"}
[15:17:28] <synapt> Inside of a <div> block
[15:17:44] <synapt> Yet it's tripping out on the &quot;'s as if .text() is converting them back into raw "
[15:18:01] <robertmaxrees> synapt can you make a fiddle?
[15:18:07] <synapt> Yeah one sec
[15:18:15] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito your current data object doens't make sense btw.
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> can you fix it?
[15:18:58] <ruibrito> @ robertmaxrees ok, so I receive that JSON array for my Java server, I can change how the information in the json is compile to fit any design i want
[15:19:11] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito the data you shared in the fiddle isn't valid.
[15:19:13] <robertmaxrees> could you correct it?
[15:20:11] <synapt> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/6osxd22d/
[15:21:06] <synapt> Or well http://jsfiddle.net/6osxd22d/2/ now (I'm a fast editor, sorry)
[15:21:43] <synapt> Now if you remove the &quot;'s it works completely fine, but with the &quot;'s it's like text() is still converting them back into "'s, either that or parseJSON is oddly
[15:21:53] <robertmaxrees> synapt i'm looking. one sec.
[15:21:59] <robertmaxrees> it's .text() btw - that's the culprit.
[15:22:00] <ruibrito> it is correct now, sorry for the mistake
[15:22:02] <robertmaxrees> console.log() it.
[15:22:09] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito hit update and share the new link :)
[15:22:14] <synapt> I did, note the latest update; http://jsfiddle.net/6osxd22d/2/
[15:22:18] <synapt> I added a console.log()
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> synapt of the text, not the parsejson bit.
[15:22:39] <ruibrito> http://jsfiddle.net/ruibritopt/vjq0rk0v/2/
[15:23:14] <robertmaxrees> synapt try .html() ?
[15:23:30] <synapt> robertmaxrees: html() did it first, which is why I actually tried to use text(), assuming it wouldn't touch the actual encoding, lol
[15:23:59] <synapt> good lord those timeouts
[15:24:07] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[15:24:37] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[15:24:42] <synapt> Indeed
[15:25:03] <robertmaxrees> i... have no idea atm.  and i'm in the middle of something else.  maybe file a bug?
[15:25:05] <synapt> For what it's worth an old 1.4 jQuery did this as well, I updated to the latest 1.11 just before asking in here thinking maybe it was an old bug
[15:25:18] <synapt> Will do, I guess I'll have to find a way around this myself for the time being, lol
[15:25:27] <robertmaxrees> though I have to ask - why are you trying to parse text like that?
[15:26:24] <synapt> Yeah I had a feeling that question was coming, lol.  Short version; I'm playing around with different (this is just one of a few) concepts of managing stuff from a framework system, while using jquery as an async'd loaded script (and not relying on $(document).ready() in-line)
[15:26:56] <synapt> came across the weird buggery with the text() re-encoding and figured I'd ask about it just incase it was a bug
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about what that has to do with trying to parse text and JSON like that.
[15:27:18] <robertmaxrees> but okj.
[15:27:31] <synapt> Well like
[15:28:21] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: the jsfidle updated http://jsfiddle.net/ruibritopt/vjq0rk0v/2/
[15:28:29] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito yeah, looking now.
[15:28:35] <robertmaxrees> why are you using $.each() btw?
[15:28:45] <synapt> robertmaxrees: Basically it's like this, originally I defined a bunch of item-specific stuff for like hotkey features amongst other things, but they were defined in-line JS through the framework via a $(document).ready() call, issue is when you async include jQuery, often it's not finished loading before the browser hits that $(document).ready() in-line stuff and it freaks out because $ (jQuery) doesn't exist
[15:29:05] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: thanks man :) have to plan a tree in your name or send you a pack of beers :P
[15:29:34] <robertmaxrees> synapt i'll just trust that you know what you're doing ;)
[15:29:39] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito why the $.each()?
[15:29:56] <synapt> robertmaxrees: I do, occasionally, I simply have evil-genius ideas sometimes, lol
[15:30:47] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: so i can iterate july, june, august?? I'm fairly new at web development, I usually a java developer
[15:30:54] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: .each isnt similar to a for ?
[15:31:11] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito $.each() uses jquery, which you absolutely don't need :)
[15:31:30] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito the smarter way to do this would be to make a single object whose properties are the months.
[15:32:40] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: using the actual structure? or should i updated it? could you should me how to use the properties?
[15:33:05] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito sure, one sec.
[15:36:49] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito it'd look something like this instead; http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vjq0rk0v/3/
[15:38:29] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: thanks a bunch man, sorry for pushing it, how could I address the situation of not knowing if I have Rice in there?
[15:38:39] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:38:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't see it?
[15:38:46] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: should I create an enum of all the rice, pasta, ect
[15:38:59] <robertmaxrees> javascript doesn't have enums...
[15:39:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[15:39:21] <ruibrito> won't I have a problem with the undefined?
[15:39:29] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: won't I have a problem with the undefined?
[15:39:45] <robertmaxrees> i was leaving tht bit for you.
[15:39:47] <robertmaxrees> simple if check.
[15:40:50] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: yeah yeah, sure, now i got it the rest, how can I thank you for this, I was going crazy
[15:44:20] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vjq0rk0v/5/ basically.
[15:44:24] <robertmaxrees> also, be careful with doing any math in JS.
[15:44:28] <robertmaxrees> it's very unreliable.
[15:45:07] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v0swd3vx/
[15:46:05] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: do you recommend anything in particular when dealing with the math? or just a heads-up
[15:46:15] <robertmaxrees> don't to it in JS.
[15:46:35] <robertmaxrees> or multiply everything by 100, do your math, then divide by 100 later on.
[15:46:38] <robertmaxrees> but don't do it in js.
[15:46:41] <robertmaxrees> decimals are shaky at best.
[15:46:43] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: but in this case i have to, i need to sum all the rice values
[15:46:50] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: how should i go about it then?
[15:46:55] <robertmaxrees> i just told you.
[15:47:09] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: sorry, i saw it now ;)
[15:49:26] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: thank you for your help, I will implement the functions whit the help of your code, I can't tell how helpful this was
[15:49:33] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[16:05:12] <jackunion> Guys, any chances someone here have an experience with slick?
[16:07:31] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ jackunion
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> awww the bot doesn't like me today.
[16:07:47] <robertmaxrees> jackunion just ask your question :)
[16:09:51] <jackunion> I can't get it to work. HTML markup: http://pastebin.com/i8pcFcu7 and result: http://i.imgur.com/yeVrKyQ.png
[16:10:04] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a jsfiddle?
[16:15:25] <jackunion> robertmaxrees : http://jsfiddle.net/c2vjwxqa/
[16:15:49] <jackunion> it works with keyboard arrows
[16:16:38] <jackunion> but it is far away from examples on official website
[16:19:42] <robertmaxrees> so what's supposed to happen here?
[16:21:06] <jackunion> something closer to this? http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[16:22:19] <robertmaxrees> works for me.
[16:22:22] <robertmaxrees> click and drag, at least.
[16:44:27] <adamellsworth> is it possible to .find().replaceWith() ?
[16:44:33] <adamellsworth> I can't seem to get it to work
[16:44:53] <adamellsworth> !paste
[16:45:06] <robertmaxrees> try setting a jsfiddle
[16:45:29] <robertmaxrees> because that should work.
[16:45:33] <robertmaxrees> at long as your find() works.
[16:59:27] <adamellsworth> http://jsbin.com/qilosajozehi/1/edit
[16:59:42] <adamellsworth> That's basically what I'm trying to do
[17:00:25] <adamellsworth> make #progress = #progress__uploadAsset
[17:02:00] <adamellsworth> but $(a).find(b).replaceWith(c); doesn't seem to have any effect
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:04:44] <adamellsworth> yeah
[17:04:54] <adamellsworth> i don't get why it isn't working
[17:06:46] <robertmaxrees> the find isn't working.
[17:06:48] <robertmaxrees> hrrrrmmmm
[17:07:43] <adamellsworth> oh yeah
[17:08:02] <adamellsworth> in chrome it works
[17:08:05] <adamellsworth> in the console
[17:08:08] <adamellsworth> just not in js bin
[17:08:44] <adamellsworth> $(a).find(b) = [<div class=​"progress-bar" id=​"progress" style=​"width:​ 0%;​">​0%​</div>​]
[17:10:22] <adamellsworth> and:   $(a).find(b).prop('outerHTML', c); doesn't seem to work either
[17:10:33] <robertmaxrees> again, because the .find() isn't working.
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking to see why.
[17:10:50] <adamellsworth> but it is working, just not in JS bin
[17:11:01] <adamellsworth> if you go into the console and define the variables they work just fine.
[17:11:03] <robertmaxrees> which doesn't get you very var ;)
[17:11:06] <robertmaxrees> *far
[17:11:11] <adamellsworth> I don't understand the descrepency
[17:11:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm loioking at iut.
[17:11:20] <robertmaxrees> *it
[17:12:12] <robertmaxrees> it's probably something about the way the fragment works.
[17:15:47] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[17:15:51] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:15:54] <robertmaxrees> return values lol
[17:16:08] <adamellsworth> ?
[17:16:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xc87jrde/
[17:16:46] <robertmaxrees> $(a).find(b).replaceWith(c); <- this returns the result of the .find()
[17:16:50] <robertmaxrees> not of replaceWith()
[17:17:50] <adamellsworth> oh you can't chain it?
[17:18:05] <robertmaxrees> you can, but not the way you'd think.
[17:18:33] <robertmaxrees> per the docs: "The .replaceWith() method, like most jQuery methods, returns the jQuery object so that other methods can be chained onto it. However, it must be noted that the original jQuery object is returned. This object refers to the element that has been removed from the DOM, not the new element that has replaced it."
[17:18:58] <adamellsworth> oh, duh
[17:19:02] <adamellsworth> that's a silly way to return
[17:19:22] <Fall> lel
[17:20:55] <adamellsworth> thanks for the guidance on that
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[17:21:22] <vinex08> can i make a pdf have a flipbook effect using jQuery? does that even exist? y/n?
[17:21:32] <robertmaxrees> n
[17:21:44] <vinex08> okies
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> wrong way to use jquery ;)
[17:24:42] <vinex08> how about if i make them images?
[17:24:46] <vinex08> http://www.techonsite.com/happy-clients/
[17:32:51] <robertmaxrees> sure.  just can't do it with PDFs.
[17:49:22] <synapt> robertmaxrees: Looks like it's actually perhaps a JS bug in general
[17:49:38] <synapt> I tried doing JSON.parse(document.getElementById("item_details").innerHTML); out of curiousity, same exact error
[17:50:48] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[17:51:02] <synapt> So interestingly, at the very least, JS in latest Firefox is re-encoding the HTML entities, not sure about other browsers
[17:51:17] <robertmaxrees> wonder why innerHTML doesn't leave them unencoded...
[17:51:23] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: hi robert, it's me again, I feel embarrassed for saying this, but the var JSON in the JSFidle was a bit different from the real one, I'm still fairly new at javascript, do you have the patience to help me a bit more: http://jsfiddle.net/ruibritopt/10gb59w1/1/
[17:51:24] <Vivekananda_y510> hey everyone . anyone got a min for a drupal problem. not directly jquery related though
[17:51:30] <synapt> Good question :P
[17:51:34] <synapt> And I wonder if it's other browsers
[17:53:04] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda_y510 should probably ask in a php channel, or in a drupal channel if there is one.
[17:53:15] <robertmaxrees> ruibrito i suggested changes to make.
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> to that object.
[17:53:20] <robertmaxrees> why didn't you make the,?
[17:53:22] <robertmaxrees> *them
[17:54:15] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: you mean the var receipt?? i dont remember you saying anything about changing the structure
[17:54:24] <robertmaxrees> i changed it for you.
[17:54:28] <Vivekananda_y510> robertmaxrees, yep I guess though I am not sure of the issue. what is happening is that I am able to run an html page using ajax only but cannot run it when including the same page inside drupal. I am not sure if the error is drupal related or jquery issues or somethin
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> oh wait i didn't.  either way, ruibrito what's different in this case?
[17:55:04] <robertmaxrees> Vivekananda_y510 start with php/drupal.
[17:55:13] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: they are inside an array, i guess those are the biigest difference
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah, i showed you that object didn't I?
[17:55:41] <robertmaxrees> i dont really have time right now to explain it =/
[17:56:02] <robertmaxrees> but basically, instead of that array, create an object with properties - each property is the name of a month.
[17:56:06] <robertmaxrees> the rest is basically good to go.
[18:00:01] <ruibrito> robertmaxrees: okay i will try looking into the object properties, thank you
[18:55:38] <spetsnaz> I made an application with draggable HTML elements on it. but when I try to drag an Input or Submit element, it doesn't trigger dragmove event. Anybody got an idea?
[19:00:50] <jrockjiggz> spetsnaz: check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18760567/how-to-drag-and-drop-form-element-contents
[19:01:25] <spetsnaz> jrockjiggz:  I dont use jQuery UI Draggable widget for my app
[19:01:37] <spetsnaz> I'm using html5 native feature of draggable
[19:13:52] <spetsnaz> I made an application with draggable HTML elements on it. but when I try to drag an Input or Submit element, it doesn't trigger dragmove event. Anybody got an idea?
[19:57:42] <amh345> i've got a json response that contains partial names of my form fields ids.  is there a simple way to pair each key to an input id that contains xyz?
[19:59:00] <amh345> oh. i just found something like this $('input[id*="_date"]').css('background-color', 'red');  which might do the trick. will try.
[20:00:19] <amh345> hey. look at this. it worked.
[20:14:06] <aagii> hi all
[20:15:29] <aagii> i want to hightlight insensitively in autocomplete match
[20:16:04] <aagii> it's working sensitively
[20:16:14] <aagii> anyone know it?
[20:26:23] <tiron> aagii: insensitively?
[20:37:30] <test_> test
[20:37:55] <test_> hello
[20:38:00] <test_> someone's there???
[21:40:21] <coreyfarrell> I'm writing a simple plugin that attaches some events with .on().  do I need to provide a 'destroy' option to call .off(), or is this automatic if the element is removed?  IE if $('#content').html('replacement content') causes the element to be removed..
[21:42:11] <danemacmillan> That will definitely remove the event, unless you're using event delegation.
[21:42:38] <coreyfarrell> I'm just attaching to click / keypress events
[21:43:02] <danemacmillan> Odds are you're not using event delegation, so yes, it will be removed.
[21:43:12] <coreyfarrell> great, thanks
[21:43:13] <danemacmillan> You won't need to explicitly remove the event.
[21:43:29] <danemacmillan> No problem
[23:35:03] <basiclaser> hey this 'jquery' isn't necessary right? I just saw it in some code > '     jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[23:36:00] <obert> no conflict mode?
[23:42:13] <Cork> basiclaser: it is a way to make sure $ is jquery inside the ready function
[23:42:20] <Cork> without having to care about if it is it outside it
[23:49:45] <basiclaser> Cork: thanks guys, :)
[23:50:39] <spetsnaz> Hey there. I've been doing a draggable & sortable content with HTML5 native draggable functions. But some elements such as input text, button etc. doesn't work when you try to hold and drag. Anybody got an idea?
