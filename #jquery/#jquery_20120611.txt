[00:14:50] <rags> can someone recommend a good star rating plugin? Searching online I found a plugin by fyneworks that seem to be the most current
[00:15:31] <NodeX> build your own .. takes about an hour
[00:15:32] <Flo0815> good morning guys
[00:43:52] <overburn> hey guys - say i have a jquery dialog and a form in it - how do i submit the form only in the dialog without reloading the rest of the page?
[00:44:43] <hooloovoo> overburn: you don't submit it at all. send the data as a ajax request instead.
[00:45:38] <zamba> i want to iterate over some table rows and only set the first 10 visible.. the remaining should remain hidden.. how can i do that using jquery?
[00:45:39] <overburn> hooloovoo: say i want to submit it - i've done it a while ago, i just can't seem to remember
[00:46:21] <hooloovoo> overburn: i doubt it since forms works like links. you will get send off the current page unless your action is #
[00:46:39] <hooloovoo> and if it is you still need some ajax request to send in the data instead.
[01:09:11] <rabbi1> validation doesn't work for first filed in a form, using validate.js... any suggestion ?
[01:14:43] <lotus> rabbi1, show code
[01:15:54] <Christer_> Does anyone know about any nice JQuery Quiz plugins/ Widgets?
[01:15:59] <codeAssassin> or make a jsfiddle on jsfiddle.net
[01:19:25] <koiti> hy i am running http://www.inercomp.com/#referenzen and i try do use accordion. but when i open the side i cant see the first content and when i switch between the contents it isnt flowding. what am i doing wrong?
[01:19:42] <zamba> https://raw.github.com/padolsey/jQuery-Plugins/master/sortElements/jquery.sortElements.js - i'm trying to use this to sort a table, but the problem is that it uses textual sorting instead of numeric.. how can i easily fix that?
[01:23:27] <codeAssassin> koiti: which accordion are you using?
[01:26:39] <tga> my jquery mobile app misses the first hash change, then works fine
[01:26:47] <tga> any idea what could cause that?
[01:32:14] <koiti> codeassassin i am using http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion
[01:34:47] <codeAssassin> koiti: can you get your code in a jsfiddle @ jsfiddle.net ?
[01:36:06] <koiti> codeassassin it is wordpress. but i can try to get every think out you need
[01:36:41] <codeAssassin> koiti: that would be great. I dont know anything about wordpress, maybe it conflicts or something
[01:36:55] <koiti> yeah i think so.
[01:37:59] <codeAssassin> koiti: the test2, 1 etc console.log's your doing. Is that the ID of the currently active accordion?
[01:38:11] <codeAssassin> var active = $( ".selector" ).accordion( "option", "active" );
[01:38:16] <codeAssassin> that one ?
[01:38:30] <koiti> no sry. its just a old log :D
[01:38:42] <codeAssassin> ok ;)
[01:41:52] <juha_> ijaa
[01:41:59] <juha_> oops
[01:46:46] <koiti> codeassassin http://jsfiddle.net/3ebLS/1/ i have copied every thing out i think
[01:55:54] <koiti> codeassassin the funny thing is, that the last 2 parts of the accordion are working right
[02:01:58] <Flo0815> hey guys. i have a function which loads data via ajx and puts the data in corresponding html-input fields ($('#el').val(data.xy); now i have a div where i want to put the data in so $.val() doesn't work. How can i detect whether it should use val() or html() ?
[02:04:29] <Flo0815> nvm, got it
[02:15:41] <rabbi1> $('form').validate().validElements().filter('#txtName, #lstStatus').length<1;  can anyone suggest filed using name instead of #txtName, and #lstStatus
[02:16:38] <overburn> hey so is it possible in jquery to select all the elements in a set class but without a certain id?
[02:20:24] <mesuutt> hi.I have a backbone template div that container '<% %>' . Wen I get html of div with $("#mydiv").html() jquery convert < and > to &lt; . How can I prevent this?
[02:27:30] <quicksilver> overburn: $('.classname:not(#idname)')
[02:27:43] <overburn> oh thanks mate
[02:32:37] <Larholm> mesuutt, use a template script section instead, it will return the html() unfiltered
[02:32:50] <Larholm> <script type="text/template" id="your_template_id"> html here </script>
[02:33:10] <Larholm> template scripts are not parsed either
[02:37:27] <mazzachre> I have a problem with IE9 and a script. On a click I add a new element and make it dragable. If the user just clicks, in all other browsers (not IE9) the draggable.start and draggable.stop events are triggered, however in IE9 they are never triggered. Is this something that is known? Or am I doing something wrong?
[02:38:12] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[02:39:03] <mazzachre> It is huge... and I am not sure I am allowed to pastebin it. I can make a more annonymized version and paste bin that...
[02:43:42] <ENQ> should i make this refer to jquery object in closures? or just pass an element as parameters? whant it to be like other plugins :)
[02:45:59] <mesuutt> Thanks Larholm :) .Why jquery behave difference to div and script?
[02:46:54] <codeAssassin> koiti: http://jsfiddle.net/3ebLS/3/
[02:48:22] <mazzachre> NodeX: http://pastebin.com/hTadU98h It is this one... Apparently the trigger(e).simulate('mousemove', ...); does nothing on IE9, but works on all others...
[02:49:53] <mazzachre> Or rather, if it works, it does not trigger a start/drag/stop event on the draggable
[02:51:40] <tomoyuki28jp> input.change()'s callback won't be trigger till input.blur(). Do I have to use keypress, keyup and keydown? Is there a event for it?
[02:52:45] <mazzachre> tomoyuki28jp: Depends on what you want to do... If you want to check that input is "correct" then keydown can help you (returning false will not allow the input) if you want to change something keyup is probably better...
[02:53:04] <tomoyuki28jp> mazzachre: thanks!
[02:53:39] <danst> hmmmm
[02:53:42] <danst> guys
[02:53:54] <danst> I ran into a very weird trouble
[02:54:32] <danst> when I submit form with ajax and then as a callback I try to load result page into a block element it loads cached one
[02:55:07] <danst> so I have to do something like $(selector).load("/path", function() { $(selector).load("/path") } );
[02:55:10] <mazzachre>  http://pastebin.com/hTadU98h Can anyone help me as to why IE9 does not trigger draggable.start/drag/stop while the rest of all browsers does?
[02:55:26] <danst> is there any less painful way to load uncached page after submitting a form
[02:55:38] <mazzachre> danst: That is not strange, that is the designed behaviour.. add a cache = false to the call
[02:55:46] <danst> oh
[02:57:44] <danst> hm
[02:57:46] <danst> nope
[02:57:51] <danst> sadly that didn't work for me
[02:58:39] <danst> mazzachre: btw I already have $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false }); at the very beginning of initializing my app
[02:59:58] <mazzachre> danst: Hmm, that is strange then... Have you checked the network communication? Is it the server returning cached data or is the request never made?
[03:00:20] <danst> ah probably that's because of my rails application caches lots of data that it shouldn't
[03:01:49] <danst> oh wait lol
[03:03:08] <mazzachre> Should I simulate some drag even instead of mousemove? http://pastebin.com/hTadU98h (line 139)
[03:03:41] <danst> mazzachre: I've just read server logs and I absolutely have no idea why, but the very first request goes for "success" line in my ajax request and the second one is for POST
[03:12:05] <danst> maybe I should use .done
[03:12:34] <danst> awwwright
[03:19:48] <mazzachre> Hmmm, am I analyzing this problem right? In my "addNewReservation", triggered on mousedown IE9 does not continue the "mousedown" state, but end it before my "simulate mousemove"?
[03:25:16] <tomoyuki28jp> What's the best way to upload a file via ajax?
[03:28:31] <_helpPlz_> i have a question.. if i have to clone some object (suppose options for a function) & somebody placed a Node (eq: <a>) .. in it, $.extend() would require more time to process right? since it would try to clone Node and not call $.clone() ?
[03:32:04] <ENQ> can i ask again? :D
[03:32:19] <ENQ> why i get error on closure http://pastebin.com/NjaNH9z6 its executes tho

[03:34:52] <tga> annoying jqmobile problem: doing a changePage() in document.ready makes the framework ignore the _first_ page hash change
[03:34:57] <Xotix> hi
[03:35:00] <tga> any idea how I can approach this?
[03:35:29] <Xotix> if editor.getValue() returns "ffoooooo" why does $(editor.getValue()) return []?
[03:35:30] <ENQ> check what page it is in event?
[03:36:10] <tga> ENQ: was that for me?
[03:36:16] <ENQ> yep?
[03:36:20] <tga> what do you mean?
[03:36:29] <tga> I am trying to get bookmarkable pages

[03:36:58] <tga> thing is, the next hash change doesn't also change the page
[03:38:06] <kelye> hello, is there a way to remove the default styling of dialog buttons ?
[03:38:20] <_helpPlz_> Xotix, idk what exactly you are talking about, but i was reading about $.extend({}, "hi") returns "h","i"
[03:38:48] <kelye> i'm doing something like buttons: { text : 'Ok', class: 'btn', click: function...}
[03:39:14] <kelye> but it just adds my btn class, not replacing the original theme
[03:40:28] <ENQ> kelye, do manual removal?
[03:42:10] <kelye> how?
[03:42:39] <danst> kelye: $(".btn").click(function() { $(this).removeClass("btn"); $(this).addClass("fgsfds") }); maybe
[03:43:25] <ENQ> kelye, $().click().removeClass();
[03:45:13] <_helpPlz_> ENQ, what is the console ouput?
[03:45:39] <ENQ> its says opts.success() is undefined
[03:45:44] <ENQ> but its executes
[03:45:57] <ENQ> if i remove call, no errro ecures
[03:46:00] <ENQ> ocures
[03:46:05] <Xotix> http://pastebin.com/ea2LTeaE why is this not working? no errors. GetValue() returns "foooooo"; (correct) and then it fails. if i have text and no markup it gets deleted but if i put the text into any kind of html element it works.
[03:46:31] <_helpPlz_> check output of console.log(opts.success())
[03:47:17] <_helpPlz_> ENQ,  .. opts.success is "undefined"  or opts.success() is "undefined"
[03:47:45] <ENQ> with () opts.success()
[03:48:08] <_helpPlz_> then shift opts.call() to next line :P
[03:48:52] <ENQ> doesnt help :P
[03:49:22] <ENQ> the weird thing is that it executes
[03:51:07] <_helpPlz_> ENQ, console.log(opts) and check DOM it might be useful
[03:51:37] <ENQ> i have, functions is there, and defined, if i remove call(this) its all good
[03:51:47] <ENQ> but object isnt passed to closure
[03:54:59] <ENQ> damn it
[03:55:51] <tocka> Could someone tell me what Im doing wrong?
[03:55:52] <ENQ> problem was with thos ()
[03:55:54] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/ZgmmuqdE
[03:57:08] <ENQ> why you cast data to jquery object?
[03:57:26] <ENQ> it will be true all the time?
[03:57:29] <tocka> no
[03:57:32] <tocka> true or false
[03:57:38] <ENQ> so dont cast it
[03:57:55] <tocka> so if(data == false){ something }
[03:57:57] <tocka> like this?
[03:57:59] <ENQ> yes
[03:58:02] <tocka> thanks <3
[03:58:19] <ENQ> there is cast in example becouse they fetch html text
[03:58:49] <_helpPlz_> boolean.parse() ?
[03:59:34] <ENQ> should use, becouse if he returns fasle exidentaly it will evolute to true :D
[04:00:25] <tocka> O-o
[04:00:26] <tocka> wha?
[04:00:39] <tocka> how can false evolute to true?
[04:01:43] <ENQ> not false
[04:01:50] <ENQ> but "fasle" a typo
[04:03:54] <tocka> oh
[04:03:55] <tocka> :D
[04:05:27] <tocka> Still, ENQ iv changed it how you told me and its the same thing :) it shows that its always false but it returns true (I check through firebug)
[04:05:27] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/6je3u6Au
[04:05:30] <tocka> No idae
[04:05:37] <tocka> idea* what happenin
[04:05:38] <tocka> idea* what happening
[04:06:08] <_helpPlz_> tocka, use boolean.parse
[04:06:19] <tocka> k
[04:08:02] <_helpPlz_> tocka, consider response to be text/html or something. meaning, "true" or "false"
[04:08:35] <_helpPlz_> tocka, check (data === "true")
[04:09:12] <tocka> _helpPlz_ yup
[04:09:19] <tocka> I was missing ""
[04:09:20] <tocka> thanks
[04:09:21] <tocka> :)
[04:10:07] <mazzachre> OK, further debug info on http://pastebin.com/svm32p6M the simulate call is never triggered, but no exception or error is shown. Afaik the return "ghost.draggable" works, but either the "trigger(e)" does not return? Or something else is very wrong?
[04:11:43] <_helpPlz_> lol i have 20 s delay on irc
[04:12:02] <_helpPlz_> oh wait 2 mins Ping reply from _helpPlz_ in 2 minutes, 6.45 seconds.
[04:12:31] <Onkeltem> Hi. I'm making an ajax widget which gets some content from a server and inserts it into DOM. The problem, is that apart from content I get additional CSS, which is inserted into DOM, and I get a kind of syncronizations issue, when the content is displayed before the CSS was applied to it. How may I workaround this?
[04:15:50] <Onkeltem> Is there any even which triggers when I modify the DOM tree by inserting additional CSS, and when this CSS is fully loaded and parsed and is applied?
[04:15:54] <Onkeltem> event*
[04:16:30] <r3v3rb> can some one tell me why I get 'invalid or illegal text' when trying to push this using .html(data) where data consists of multiple:
[04:16:31] <r3v3rb> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151746098333306&set=a.99394368305.88399.40796308305&type=1" target="_blank"><img src="http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/521473_10151746098333306_1830330474_s.jpg"/></a>
[04:17:43] <r3v3rb> Onkeltem: is there not a success function to the method you use to add/edit the css?
[04:19:06] <Onkeltem> r3v3rb: indeed it is. on success, I execute 2 commands in this order: add css to the head, add content to the body. And the content is appeared for a moments w/o css applied
[04:19:42] <Onkeltem> r3v3rb: then it is definitely slylized, but the change is visible to a user
[04:19:53] <r3v3rb> hide the content until after the css is applied then show? maybe?
[04:20:07] <ENQ> put a timeout :D
[04:20:09] <r3v3rb> fadeIn('slow') for a nicer effect?
[04:20:26] <ENQ> its probably becouse styles is fetched with subsequent requests
[04:20:27] <Onkeltem> r3v3rb: and thats the queastion :) How can I bind to the moment css is ready to be applied?
[04:20:31] <ENQ> its not inline styles is it?
[04:20:45] <Onkeltem> ENQ: no, it is link to a css file :)
[04:21:42] <ENQ> you might check, but its possible that styles is fetched after you instert content into DOM
[04:21:45] <r3v3rb> any ideas on the invalid / illegal text with the $('#myDiv').html(data) ?
[04:22:45] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, is css linked to same html you are fetching via ajax?
[04:23:16] <r3v3rb> driving me insane if I use .load for the content its fine - but I want to do stuff whilst getting the content so switched to .click and .get and now get an error with the same content being returned...
[04:24:33] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/sRVXX/ for the code I am using
[04:24:54] <r3v3rb> alert(data) is returning what I would expect - the link and image you see above
[04:25:18] <r3v3rb> but $('#ajaxContent').html(data) throws the error
[04:27:07] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: yes
[04:27:31] <Milos> I have a script that runs indefinitely (on a web server), would it be possible to request it with ajax and be able to do other things at the same time?
[04:27:42] <Milos> Basically, it returns live GPS coordinates.
[04:27:43] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, i meant <link> tag or is it seperate?
[04:27:50] <Milos> I need to plot those as it receives them.
[04:27:55] <Milos> They arrive one per line, indefinitely.
[04:28:39] <Zhy> Has anyone here encountered bazilion validation calls in their implementation? I'm using $.post to post data to a php validation function (the $.post is fired upon input blur) and on the first input it's called twice, the more I "blur", the more calls for validation are made although only that one field is validated
[04:28:56] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: it is added as <style> with @import instruction.
[04:29:59] <mathewrapid> Milos, are you trying to push data to the client?
[04:30:30] <Milos> mathewrapid, sort of. The data arrives in a constant stream and I don't want to request every second, seems silly, but this seems complex.
[04:30:52] <Zhy> ah nvm , got it ; )
[04:32:06] <mathewrapid> Milos, you could either do it via websockets, but it's not a solid solution yet. So... ...if the server produces the data in a constant stream and you read it to the client in short bursts then perhaps plain xhr would be the best bet, imho.
[04:32:26] <r3v3rb> any one at all? .html(data) returns invalid or illegal string from .get yet .load into the same div works perfectly?
[04:32:38] <Milos> I have not heard of xhr, I will look into it, and WebSockets came to mind as well. I'm also looking at web workers.
[04:32:58] <karbassi> xhr = XMLHttpRequest
[04:33:07] <karbassi> basically ajax
[04:33:50] <mathewrapid> Milos, WebWorkers are for threading, not data retrieving. Well, you could retrieve the data via WebWorkers using WebSockets or xhr; I think it might be a tad overkill
[04:34:11] <Milos> mathewrapid, well threading means I can do two things at once.
[04:35:16] <mathewrapid> yes it does, but if you do async xhr it doesn't matter, especially if you're retrieving some GPS coordinates
[04:35:29] <r3v3rb> mathewrapid: http://jsfiddle.net/sRVXX/ could you explain why it returns invalid or illegal string yet using $('#ajaxContent').load works perfectly...
[04:35:42] <Milos> oh xhr is just ajax.
[04:35:53] <Milos> I had to Google it.
[04:36:01] <mathewrapid> Milos, :)
[04:36:19] <Milos> But the thing is the request blocks permanently, it never finishes.
[04:36:25] <Milos> That's why it's a problem.
[04:36:25] <mathewrapid> r3v3rb, I'm sorry but I'm a total n00b when it comes to jQuery
[04:36:38] <r3v3rb> ok, np
[04:36:48] <mathewrapid> Milos, I think the problem is your server  script that is running indef.
[04:37:13] <Milos> mathewrapid, well I just imlpemented that because I don't like the idea of having to request every second.
[04:37:21] <Milos> But as I mentioned before, that might have complicated things a bit.
[04:37:43] <mathewrapid> What server are you running and what server-side language?
[04:37:49] <Milos> lighttpd/python
[04:38:01] <karbassi> what's the problem?
[04:38:01] <r3v3rb> very strange or I am completely thick...
[04:38:20] <Milos> The problem is, I have a script which runs indefinitely for design reasons, and I need to be able to read it with ajax as data arrives.
[04:38:24] <Milos> But javascript is single-threaded blah blah blah
[04:38:41] <karbassi> Milos: do what fb does
[04:38:48] <Milos> websockets?
[04:38:48] <karbassi> it's called long-polling
[04:38:54] <Milos> long polling o_O
[04:39:08] <karbassi> ?g long polling javascript stackoverflow
[04:39:09] <mathewrapid> Milos, I hope you know that the web (http) is stateless. You can always keep a connection open for a longer period of time (excluding WebSockets that are open for as loong as the app requires)
[04:39:09] <bot-t> karbassi, http - Simple "Long Polling" example code? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333664/simple-long-polling-example-code
[04:39:34] <Milos> mathewrapid, but my raspberry pi uses CPU to reaload the python script every time.
[04:39:40] <karbassi> Milos: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/333664/simple-long-polling-example-code
[04:39:40] <Milos> s/rea/re/
[04:39:45] <Milos> karbassi, thanks
[04:40:53] <karbassi> Milos: be sure to set $.ajax with async: true, cache: false, and timeout: LARGE NUMBER
[04:41:18] <Milos> I am not understanding that stackoverflow example.
[04:41:49] <Milos> It looks like some random PHP script.
[04:42:01] <karbassi> Milos: basically the JS code requests a file from the backend system (in the code, it's php. you can use python).
[04:42:30] <Milos> But my file never finishes executing. Is it not possible to do it like so?
[04:42:39] <Milos> There is too much overhead in my case to run the script every time.
[04:43:14] <karbassi> Milos: well, if you want a "stream" or "hose" to happen, then you'll need to have these long calls
[04:43:30] <r3v3rb> karbassi: do you have two seconds to look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/sRVXX/ and tell me why if I use $('#ajaxContent').load it works perfectly yet trying to manually inject the same 'data' errors with invalid or illegal string?
[04:43:49] <karbassi> or do the exact opposite (short-polling) which does an ajax call every 1 to 2 seconds
[04:44:02] <Milos> I can't poll.
[04:44:23] <Milos> I already have a stream.
[04:44:32] <Milos> I just need to be able to use it simultaneously
[04:44:40] <karbassi> Milos: "async"
[04:44:49] <karbassi> ?async @ Milos
[04:44:49] <Milos> it doesn't apply karbassi
[04:44:50] <bot-t> Milos, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[04:44:59] <Milos> My request NEVER FINISHES
[04:45:04] <Milos> I cannot set a callback handler
[04:45:07] <Milos> because it never finishes
[04:45:21] <Milos> but I still get a valid stream
[04:45:23] <karbassi> Milos: past the js/python code
[04:45:31] <karbassi> paste*
[04:45:32] <Milos> it's just a while loop with a print
[04:45:35] <mathewrapid> karbassi, ty
[04:45:35] <Milos> nothing to paste
[04:45:38] <ravenzz> so you should thing to an approach different from a regular ajax request
[04:45:48] <Milos> I will, if this is impossible
[04:45:52] <Milos> but I don't think it is
[04:46:24] <karbassi> r3v3rb: what does the url your requesting return?
[04:46:37] <r3v3rb> html links and images
[04:46:42] <karbassi> Milos: it's not impossible; I've done it before.
[04:46:45] <r3v3rb> I am trying .ajax instead so I can specify
[04:46:46] <Milos> :D
[04:46:48] <ravenzz> seems to be something like a realtime app, your connection need to be open all the time
[04:47:02] <Milos> ravenzz, it's a live stream of GPS coordinates on a low power device
[04:47:22] <ravenzz> I see
[04:47:29] <Milos> I can't request every second because that is too much overhead
[04:47:34] <ravenzz> ofc
[04:47:50] <karbassi> r3v3rb: so the pasted code is working or not working?
[04:47:51] <Milos> everything is implemented
[04:47:55] <Milos> but I can't think of a way to READ the stream
[04:47:57] <Milos> with javascript
[04:48:01] <Milos> to plot on a map, in real time
[04:48:06] <NodeX> you have to poll or long poll
[04:48:11] <NodeX> they are your only options
[04:48:15] <Milos> :(
[04:48:20] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, you can process complete response, and load all script, style & img links before displaying it
[04:48:20] <NodeX> or some flash based listner
[04:48:23] <r3v3rb> karbassi: the returned 'data' in alert is fine, the attempt to push it in to #ajaxContent fails
[04:48:33] <karbassi> r3v3rb: what's the error?
[04:48:45] <r3v3rb> invalid or illegal string
[04:49:21] <karbassi> r3v3rb: 1) remember that window.alert() will stop the window process. try to use console if you can. (ie sucks)
[04:49:23] <ryanaz> how do I grab the event when someone leaves an input box?
[04:49:29] <ryanaz> focusout ?
[04:49:31] <r3v3rb> karbassi: ok, np
[04:49:41] <Milos> NodeX, webworkers?
[04:49:42] <karbassi> 2) make sure data is a valid string.
[04:49:43] <pachet> NodeX, Milos: what's wrong with websockets? or am i missing something
[04:49:46] <ravenzz> Milos I don't have experice at all in that field, but maybe socket.io can hel you
[04:49:53] <ravenzz> +p
[04:49:55] <Milos> pachet, nothing I haven't tried websockets yet, still reading on them
[04:49:59] <NodeX> pachet : not universally supported!
[04:50:04] <Milos> oh who cares
[04:50:06] <Milos> this is an internal app
[04:50:09] <pachet> ^
[04:50:10] <Milos> I'll run whatever it's supported on
[04:50:13] <NodeX> if you're happy for just html5 then use websockets
[04:50:22] <Milos> yeah it doesn't matter what's supported and what isn't for me
[04:50:27] <Milos> as long as something is!
[04:50:28] <pachet> Milos: they're definitely, 100% what you're looking for
[04:50:34] <pachet> easy to implement and scale
[04:50:41] <Milos> pachet, awesome I will see if I can get something out of them
[04:50:54] <pachet> :D
[04:51:36] <r3v3rb> karbassi: data returns: <a href='http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=403062093305&set=a.99394368305.88399.40796308305&type=1' target='_blank'><img src='http://photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/32042_403062093305_5779341_s.jpg'/></a>
[04:51:48] <r3v3rb> tried with double quotes too in case
[04:52:10] <NodeX> http://www.websocket.org/http://www.websocket.org/
[04:52:13] <NodeX> oops
[04:52:13] <NodeX> http://www.websocket.org/
[05:04:23] <Milos> DOUBLE WEBSOCKETS
[05:04:37] <karbassi> r3v3rb: try using $.ajax and specify the "dataType" value as html
[05:04:37] <r3v3rb> karbassi: tried same result
[05:04:38] <r3v3rb> :D
[05:04:38] <r3v3rb> yet $('#ajaxContent').load('URL'); workes fines
[05:04:38] <r3v3rb> workes… lol works*
[05:04:38] <karbassi> r3v3rb: then why not use $().load?
[05:04:38] <karbassi> seems to be doing what you want it to do
[05:04:39] <r3v3rb> karbassi: indeed, it seems its the link formation that is throwing the error, removing the link results in working code...
[05:05:46] <r3v3rb> karbassi: am i being stupid what could be wrong with this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150779685738306&set=a.99394368305.88399.40796308305&type=1"><img src="http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/155472_10150779685738306_325784706_s.jpg"/></a> that would cause invalid or illegal string?
[05:06:11] <r3v3rb> remove the wrapping <a href and everything works fine...
[05:07:37] <pachet> r3v3rb: its a valid javascript string
[05:07:54] <pachet> ?eval '<a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150779685738306&set=a.99394368305.88399.40796308305&type=1"><img src="http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/155472_10150779685738306_325784706_s.jpg"/></a>'

[05:08:00] <r3v3rb> pachet so why would .load or .ajax bitch ?
[05:08:13] <laszlof> .
[05:08:17] <pachet> dunno, make a paste
[05:08:22] <r3v3rb> about invalid string.. ok
[05:09:44] <r3v3rb> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/sRVXX/1/
[05:10:08] <r3v3rb> url comes from cms and works perfectly if the returned data doesn't have the links...
[05:10:55] <laszlof> paste what comes from the cms
[05:10:59] <laszlof> not the variable
[05:11:06] <r3v3rb> thats the data in the html
[05:11:19] <r3v3rb> window of the fiddle
[05:11:29] <r3v3rb> exactly as the console writes it
[05:12:45] <laszlof> we need to see what $URLSegment is set to
[05:13:06] <r3v3rb> win/FacebookAlbum
[05:14:19] <laszlof> what kind of error/message are you seeing from the ajax call?
[05:14:37] <r3v3rb> invalid or illegal string
[05:14:52] <laszlof> on which line?
[05:15:15] <r3v3rb> jqeury 1.4.2 line 112
[05:15:24] <r3v3rb> jquery 1.4.2 even
[05:15:29] <pachet> that's not of much help
[05:16:01] <r3v3rb> what line do you want thats the only line mentioned in the error?
[05:16:41] <laszlof> it would be easier if we could actually see the error ocurring
[05:17:06] <r3v3rb> unfortunately its not on the server yet, localhost only
[05:17:36] <laszlof> line 112 in jquery 1.4.2 is a comment.. are you using the minified version?
[05:17:41] <r3v3rb> i am
[05:17:43] <r3v3rb> :D
[05:17:49] <r3v3rb> want me to switch
[05:17:49] <laszlof> load the full version
[05:17:51] <laszlof> and run it again
[05:17:53] <r3v3rb> ok
[05:17:59] <laszlof> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.js
[05:18:27] <laszlof> at least we can see what is actually breaking
[05:18:35] <laszlof> and give you an idea from that
[05:19:15] <r3v3rb> 	
[05:19:16] <r3v3rb> div.innerHTML = wrap[1] + elem + wrap[2]; line 4448
[05:19:56] <laszlof> try removing your dataType for the ajax call
[05:20:53] <r3v3rb> same error
[05:21:14] <laszlof> .html shouldnt really care about the quoting and such
[05:22:11] <laszlof> any particular reason your using html?
[05:22:14] <r3v3rb> going to try changing doctype
[05:22:16] <laszlof> you're*
[05:22:39] <r3v3rb> html or ?
[05:22:40] <laszlof> if you have control over the source script, I'd probably use json instead since its just URL's you're passing.
[05:23:06] <mazzachre> Is there a drag/drop error in IE9? I can't seem to get "simulated drag and drop" to work... I create an element to drag (Attached to a mouse down event) however the event handlers on that element are never called in IE9, where they are working in all other browsers I have tested in so far.
[05:23:09] <laszlof> then you can just use .append/.appendTo to add them to the top container
[05:23:13] <r3v3rb> okay, because the data needs to come back through a page template
[05:23:17] <mazzachre> Code is here http://pastebin.com/svm32p6M
[05:23:20] <r3v3rb> of the CMS
[05:23:47] <laszlof> ah, so its coming from a page on your cms.. so you cant (easily) control the format
[05:24:32] <r3v3rb> well, the function in the cms returns a dataset to the template engine which returns that to the jquery .ajax function
[05:24:53] <laszlof> can you modify the template to output json instead?
[05:25:17] <r3v3rb> laszlof: i can make it anything I want :D
[05:25:26] <laszlof> I would go that route, personally
[05:25:28] <karbassi> it shouldn't really matter what it returns
[05:25:41] <r3v3rb> i wouldn't have thought so karbassi
[05:25:49] <karbassi> laszlof: is the header set correctly via the cms?
[05:25:58] <r3v3rb> maybe i'll try a newer jquery and see if the error still occurs
[05:26:15] <laszlof> r3v3rb: yeah, though 1.4.2 should work fine for what you're doing
[05:26:17] <karbassi> r3v3rb: usually a good idea if you don't have dependancies.
[05:26:20] <r3v3rb> karbassi: thats the only thing I can think of doctype is incorrect
[05:26:40] <laszlof> open it with your browser and check the headers
[05:26:40] <r3v3rb> so different between page and returned data maybe...
[05:27:38] <r3v3rb> perfect, it was set to xhtml… which screwed it working now set to HTML5
[05:27:49] <r3v3rb> sorry for the inconvenience
[05:28:01] <laszlof> and thats the reason why json would be better :)
[05:28:58] <r3v3rb> laszlof: :D
[05:29:24] <laszlof> it just feels dirty pulling raw html through ajax :)
[05:30:06] <r3v3rb> lol
[05:30:19] <r3v3rb> the joke is the graph from facebook is json...
[05:30:34] <tomasm-> hi, is there a validation library that utilizes ajax/json to query a server-end on-the-fly when a form field changes to see whether the user entered a valid/unique value, etc? this is something that needs to be done immediately after a field changes and before a form submits, so the user can get some feedback that they did a field correctly, or if it's a duplicate of some field or if it's an invalid value.... I'd want both negative (re
[05:30:35] <tomasm-> d X) and positive (green checkmark) w/optional text printed as fields onchange or onblur
[05:30:46] <pachet> the joke is that dealing with any facebook api sucks
[05:30:52] <r3v3rb> but because the client needs to set the album id etc based on the page of the cms i had to go this route...
[05:31:02] <r3v3rb> pachet: true that...
[05:31:27] <laszlof> tomasm-: I dont know of a library that does that, but its fairly easy to roll your own solution
[05:32:16] <tomasm-> laszlof, yeah, so do I just do it from scratch, or are there pieces that do some lifting for me? seems like it may not be much effort from scratch
[05:32:41] <Milos> nnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[05:32:42] <Milos> http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ajax-http-stream
[05:32:46] <Milos> pachet, meanwhile, I found that ^
[05:32:51] <Milos> pachet, but ... bad luck I guess
[05:33:12] <karbassi> tomasm-: basically write 1 function: that is called via 'blur' event on the input fields
[05:33:22] <karbassi> the function does an ajax call to the server
[05:33:28] <laszlof> no, dont use .blur
[05:33:30] <pachet> .change > .blur
[05:33:33] <karbassi> ah
[05:33:34] <karbassi> yea
[05:33:40] <laszlof> you use .change with a delay
[05:33:45] <tomasm-> yeah, blur would fire even if i dont change anything
[05:33:48] <karbassi> he wanted instant
[05:33:55] <tomasm-> laszlof, why a delay?
[05:34:09] <laszlof> so it doesnt try to do an ajax call for every letter you type
[05:34:20] <pachet> laszlof: change doesnt work that way
[05:34:24] <tomasm-> laszlof, no, that would be onKeyUp, not onChange
[05:34:48] <pachet> .change fires when the actual value property of the dom element is modified
[05:34:51] <tomasm-> but i'd want that too, so if they stop typing, we assume they are finished
[05:35:06] <tomasm-> onChange requires blurring i think
[05:35:18] <laszlof> well, you could use the keypress event
[05:35:22] <laszlof> and tie a timer to it
[05:36:02] <tomasm-> but if i recall, IE doesn't trigger onChange on radios/checkboxes, since the values never change, only the checked attribute - so they need onClick's
[05:36:21] <laszlof> sec (writing a fiddle)
[05:36:50] <tomasm-> I remember an odd delay, as if it fires with the previous value or something
[05:39:03] <tomasm-> hmmm, my real trick is knowing which fields have server side validation rules, so there isnt some sluggish overkill when filling out a form
[05:41:43] <laszlof> tomasm-: http://jsfiddle.net/rcsJa/
[05:42:48] <laszlof> you could probably pass the input's value to the timer function too
[05:43:06] <tomasm-> laszlof, yes, thanks
[05:43:17] <laszlof> http://jsfiddle.net/rcsJa/1/
[05:43:33] <laszlof> then just replace the alert with your ajax call
[05:52:17] <mazzachre> OK, problem solved, kind of... Updating to the newest simululate library fixed it... That also fixed some of the other IE9 problems I had been fighting with :)
[06:15:37] <_helpPlz_> is there any way to create a jqXHR object without actually calling up .send()?
[06:20:22] <shoky> _helpPlz_: no. (what's .send() ? )
[06:20:42] <_helpPlz_> XHR.send()
[06:21:08] <johnkpaul> ?beforeSend @ _helpPlz_
[06:21:18] <shoky> what's that have to do with jqXHR
[06:22:02] <_helpPlz_> i am trying to create a jqXHR object .. tried $.ajax() without arguments but, it called up .send()
[06:22:17] <pachet> var foo = new XMLHttpRequest();
[06:22:18] <pachet> tada
[06:22:23] <_helpPlz_> btw, i have another question, does jQuery reuse XHR objects?
[06:22:23] <johnkpaul> _helpPlz_: for what purpose do you need a bare jqXHR objcet?
[06:22:31] <shoky> except that's not a jqXHR
[06:22:33] <johnkpaul> if you want to customize headers/other options, use beforeSEnd
[06:22:46] <pachet> shoky: but its as close as he's going to get
[06:22:55] <shoky> yes
[06:23:04] <shoky> unless he copy pastes from jq src ;p
[06:23:21] <_helpPlz_> lol
[06:24:06] <shoky> you're not trying to create a jqXHR object
[06:24:09] <shoky> you're trying to solve a problem
[06:24:20] <shoky> if you tell us the problem we can help. otherwise good luck making your jqxhr
[06:24:27] <_helpPlz_> lol
[06:24:46] <_helpPlz_> does jQuery reuse XHR objects?
[06:25:44] <_helpPlz_> johnkpaul, thanks i found it & other $.ajax global too that i was looking for
[06:25:48] <shoky> don't think so
[06:26:38] <supsup> ben_alman: you around?
[06:27:12] <pachet> _helpPlz_: no, it doesnt
[06:29:01] * _helpPlz_ is googling known issue of jquery.ajax with ie6
[06:29:55] <karbassi> ie6 doesn't have any issues ever </sarcasm>
[06:31:32] <_helpPlz_> lol i don't know why but, i have been asked to get every piece of code to run on ie6
[06:31:56] <pachet> which circle of hell is that
[06:32:26] <_helpPlz_> don't send me to hell yet lol
[06:33:19] <johnkpaul> you're not being sent to hell, you're already there ;)
[06:33:38] <shoky> denial phase
[06:34:03] <shoky> and the 'why' is because you're gullible enough
[06:34:45] <NodeX> _helpPlz_ : your client is errrr joking right
[06:34:46] <NodeX> ?
[06:34:54] <_helpPlz_> Oh no, i gotta go back to heaven :p
[06:35:08] <NodeX> not google nor facebook even support IE6 fully anymore
[06:35:38] <NodeX> they take the "IF it runs cool, else who cares" approach... which is the right one
[06:35:44] <_helpPlz_> NodeX, they aren't :( they have old desktops .. linux machines i am not worried about but, those with MS OS
[06:36:00] <NodeX> upgrade to chrome lol
[06:36:17] <NodeX> tell them it will take 2 years to run thru all the code and make it work
[06:36:35] <NodeX> it's cheaper and more net friendly to not propogate the use of BAD browsers
[06:42:39] <fusion27> My skull thickness is trying to make me write this selector by $(".wrapper_term_year").each(function(){}); and going after the term & year attributes inside that each loop, I know this can be written as a one line selector, help anyone? http://pastie.org/4067423
[06:43:16] <fusion27> I tried, $('.wrapper_term_year [year="'+thisYear+'"] [term="'+thisTerm+'"]').append(cell_term_year); of course which didn't work
[06:43:31] <shoky> coz of the spaces
[06:43:38] <fusion27> should I chain .filter() ?
[06:43:43] <shoky> yes
[06:43:57] <fusion27> as Homer said 'doh!'
[06:43:58] <fusion27> thanks shoky
[06:44:03] <shoky> ;P
[06:44:14] <fusion27> not enough coffee today :)
[06:44:51] <shoky> my coffee is coca cola :((
[06:45:29] <pachet> $('.wrapper_term_year[year="' + thisYear + '"][term="' + thisTerm + '"]'), as shoky said
[06:45:53] <fusion27> thanks pachet
[06:51:12] <Cubud> Hi all
[06:55:24] <pachet> Cubud: hi
[06:57:23] <Cubud> I was wondering if anyone might know why the Ajax GET on this page which works in Chrome and Firefox does not work in IE 9?
[06:57:24] <Cubud> http://northcornwallholidays.co.uk/cornwall_farm_holidays/horizon_self_catering_cornwall.html
[06:57:39] <Cubud> In IE 9 it executes the error code (alert)
[07:03:50] <_helpPlz_> Cubud it has something to do with adobe flash i think, it gives me an elevated rights popup, i click no then it gives error?
[07:06:00] <NodeX> you need to pastebin your javascript Cubud
[07:07:41] <shoky> he's getting a "No Transport" error
[07:07:51] <CodeMonkey> I'm looking at rows in a table using rows.each, and I want to see if column 3 contains certain text. How do I parse the row object? http://jsfiddle.net/KGxnC/ <-- See comment in code
[07:08:50] <pachet> Cubud: _helpPlz_: it has absolutely nothing to do with adobe flash
[07:08:59] <pachet> Cubud: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283
[07:09:11] <johnkpaul> CodeMonkey: $row.find("td").eq(2).text().indexOf("090"
[07:09:14] <pachet> ie8 and 9 use a proprietary object for CORS
[07:09:24] <pachet> er, XHR rather
[07:09:57] <_helpPlz_> CodeMonkey, $row.children("td:nth-child(3)").text()?
[07:10:05] <pachet> short version is that the jq team isnt going to add support for this
[07:10:19] <pachet> Cubud: but iirc ie10 will revert back to using standard XHR
[07:10:51] <CodeMonkey> johnkpaul: ty. I would need that in an if statement I think. Something like if (row.find("td").eq(2).text().indexOf("090") > 0) { // right? }
[07:11:04] <CodeMonkey> _helpPlz_: same question as above
[07:11:23] <johnkpaul> CodeMonkey: yes, you are correct
[07:11:35] <shoky> >= 0 though
[07:11:37] <johnkpaul> you could also use the :contains selector if you want to avoid that
[07:11:53] <johnkpaul> it's a preference, I find indexOf to be more idiomatic in js
[07:12:01] <CodeMonkey> johnkpaul: contains probably makes more sense
[07:12:14] <johnkpaul> CodeMonkey: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[07:12:53] <johnkpaul> row.find('td:contains(090)').length > 0
[07:14:57] <gg____>      to initiate a jquery plugin, I have a bunch of var settings, one of them is: album:"the value"  How do I get to remove the space so it becomes "thevalue" ? "text('the value').split(' ').join('')" gets rendered as a text string, not as a function....
[07:15:36] <Xotix> gg just replace " " with "" ?
[07:15:51] <CodeMonkey> seems to be working good, thanks
[07:16:30] <gg____> @xotix  thevalue gets populated serverside, so I have to change it clientside later
[07:16:46] <Xotix> so?
[07:16:57] <pachet> ?eval 'the value'.split(' ').join('')
[07:16:58] <caniuse> pachet: 'thevalue'
[07:17:10] <Xotix> var foo = 'hi world'; foo.replace(" ", '')
[07:17:14] <pachet> not sure what you meant by 'as a function'
[07:17:28] <gg____> @ member:identifier:xotix well i am not sure if can do functions inside a variable
[07:18:02] <CodeMonkey> text('the value').replace(' ', '');
[07:18:04] <Xotix> gg____:  what? i thought yo uwant to replace a space within on of your vars?
[07:18:06] <pachet> ?eval var foo = 'this is a test', bar = { name : foo.split(' ').join('') }; bar
[07:18:06] <caniuse> pachet: { name: 'thisisatest' }
[07:18:30] <gg____> thnaks for all the input, am trying out as I type
[07:18:36] <Xotix> pachet why would he need split and joint if he can use replace?
[07:18:53] <CodeMonkey> split and join adds a lot of unneeded overhead
[07:19:18] <gg____> I am using spilt and join instead of replace because it supposed to be faster
[07:19:20] <pachet> how so?
[07:19:26] <gg____> But it dont mind using replace
[07:19:41] <pachet> behind the scenes, both methods create a temporary array
[07:19:55] <CodeMonkey> ah, I guess I'm wrong
[07:20:01] <gg____> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/441018/replacing-spaces-with-underscores-in-javascript
[07:20:04] <pachet> in fact, the implementation of .replace without regex in v8 actually uses the same internals as split and join
[07:20:07] <pachet> so
[07:20:35] <Onkeltem> How to get all html of an element? html() retruns only innerHTML

[07:23:47] <CodeMonkey> heh. I've also been hitting F9 to run it, which is PL/SQL and Toad.
[07:26:30] <gg____> @CodeMonkey:  if i put as a variable; text('the value').replace(' ', ''); this gets rendered as text, not executed

[07:29:32] <gg____> might be more clear; its within a function i need to replace the spcae of a variable
[07:31:16] <gg____> its in fact an array of variables
[07:33:01] <gg____> @Xotix shoudl I remove the variable outside of the array, or can I work on it inside the array?

[07:42:20] <Onkeltem> Aamir: thanks, but my problem is not that IE does't insert <style> element into DOM tree. It does, but then never downloads it. In network activity log I see a line corresponding the file which saying it was interrupted (but with what and why - no info, it is microsoft...)
[07:42:33] <fangwee> Hi I have error after opening the download version 1.7.2 can anyone help?
[07:42:46] <scathen^C> hey guys i am trying to wrap the word the cursor is over in <a>, but cannot figure out how to get a range that covers the nearest word. anyone know of any links where i can read about how to do this?
[07:43:10] <sanjayb> fangwee: define "opening" - how have you included it / can you paste code + which browser, etc?
[07:43:37] <sanjayb> scathen^C, is this inside a textarea or a div ?
[07:43:45] <scathen^C> contenteditable div
[07:43:47] <scathen^C> i can get the range
[07:43:55] <scathen^C> but if it is collapsed i want the nearest word
[07:44:12] <scathen^C> i guess the nearest spaces either end
[07:45:02] <fangwee> I click Minified 1.7.2 and window ask whether to open or save, I click saved, after completed download I click run
[07:45:12] <fangwee> follow error pop out

[07:49:03] <scathen^C> cheers, i think i'll tinker with a few things. some combination of indexof and lastindexof and playing with the range ends....

[07:49:29] <CodeMonkey> hmmmm, in this code: row.find('td:contains(A1)').length <- I need to loop through and find A1, then A2, A3 ... A20. Can I just do a for loop and concatenate the value onto A?
[07:53:18] <poppiez> doesn't $.when work when used in conjunction with always()? always() fires as soon one of the two requests complete
[08:00:09] <shoky> poppiez: The method will resolve its master Deferred as soon as all the Deferreds resolve, or reject the master Deferred as soon as one of the Deferreds is rejected.
[08:02:13] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I have some trouble's understanding how delegation with .on works. I have a function that prints elements with the same class as what the event being executed is trigged by. How can I delegate the same event that made the elements to these elements?
[08:03:19] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184950/dynamically-loading-css-stylesheet-doesnt-work-on-ie
[08:03:21] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: what? jsfiddle please
[08:04:14] <poppiez> shoky: I thought it would only fire when both requests have completed no matter if a success or error
[08:04:28] <shoky> poppiez: i copied that from the docs
[08:06:09] <shoky> poppiez: otherwise, what would it fire if one request succeeds and the other request doesn't
[08:06:25] <poppiez> the alwaysCallback :)
[08:06:28] <poppiez> think I got it working now
[08:06:33] <shoky> there is no always callback
[08:06:37] <poppiez> shoky: it should fire the alwaysCallback
[08:06:44] <shoky> there is no such thing, that's just a shortcut
[08:07:02] <shoky> there is either done or fail  (& progress..)
[08:07:10] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: I want the new red boxes to be able to create other red boxes: http://jsfiddle.net/aynrs/  Thanks!
[08:08:15] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: http://jsfiddle.net/aynrs/1/
[08:09:03] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Awesome, thanks!
[08:09:46] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Ah I get that now, for some reason it just wasn't clicking with me.
[08:10:13] <fuchstronaut> is it possible to us something like an OR-operator in a css-selector? like: tr > td.class_1 OR td.class_2 > input, so it will match input elements inside of td.class_1 and td.class_2 elements?
[08:10:16] <shoky> you need to set yourself as delegate for it to click with you
[08:10:46] <shoky> fuchstronaut: use a comma
[08:11:21] <fuchstronaut> using a comma i will get all td.class_1 elements inside trs and all inputs inside of td.class_2 elements
[08:11:42] <fuchstronaut> as it will see two different selectors there
[08:11:55] <fuchstronaut> tr > td.class_1 and td.class_2 > input
[08:11:55] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Sorry I'm a little confused again. Why is the ID jQuery's pointing to #wrapper? My problem in acuality looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/aynrs/2/
[08:12:11] <shoky> fuchstronaut: you use commas with two seperate selectors, yes
[08:12:21] <fuchstronaut> thats not what i want
[08:12:32] <Archer_xda> fuchstronaut tr > td.class_1, tr > td.class_2
[08:12:46] <fuchstronaut> so theres no way to do it with one selector?
[08:13:20] <fuchstronaut> i tried wrapping the td.class_1, td.class_2 in () but that didnt work out
[08:13:48] <Archer_xda> fuchstronaut You can't do it with 1 selector - it's 2 different things
[08:13:58] <shoky> fuchstronaut: $('tr').children('td.class_1,td.class_2').children('input')
[08:13:58] <fuchstronaut> ok
[08:14:13] <Archer_xda> fuchstronaut Are you looking for something like tr > (td.class_1 || td.class_2) ?
[08:14:24] <fuchstronaut> Arcger_xda: exactly
[08:14:34] <fuchstronaut> * Archer_xda
[08:14:38] <Archer_xda> fuchstronaut - yeah, you can't do it.  You need to fully qualified selectors
[08:14:46] <fuchstronaut> more sql-esque i guess
[08:14:52] <fuchstronaut> thanks
[08:14:56] <Archer_xda> np mate
[08:15:07] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: didnt understand your question.. (or your fiddle..)
[08:15:12] <fuchstronaut> still its impressive what you can do with simple CSS selectors
[08:15:19] <fuchstronaut> really love that with jquery
[08:15:52] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: The fiddle won't work, it's more of a pastebin. Elemetns belonging to the  sel-small
[08:16:00] <DeltaHeavy> Sorry wrong key lemme type that out again
[08:16:39] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: The fiddle won't work, it's more of a pastebin. Elements belonging to the 'sel-small' class are created when sel-small is clicked. How can I use .on to attach it to this. I'm confused by your last example as to why the .on was attached to #wrapper.
[08:17:04] <shoky> because #wrapper was the element that i was delegating the click handling to
[08:17:12] <Archer_xda> fuchstronaut - me too.  Only been using it about a year so still learning all the time.  It's a great bit of kit
[08:17:38] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: What if I wanted to delegate the click to box and only box?
[08:17:57] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: then that wouldn't be delegation, that'd be simple event binding to an element
[08:18:31] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: That's what I want to do. I've tried looking this up but I'm not getting it. How would a really simple example like that work.
[08:18:59] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: you started out by asking about .on and delegation, now you're saying you want the opposite.. hmm?
[08:19:31] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: If that's the case I'm just not understanding this too well.
[08:19:49] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: I want any .box's that are created to be triggers for that event, although they are created from that same very event.
[08:20:38] <shoky> then you want delegation like i did with .on , delegating the events to a container element  (such as #wrapper)
[08:21:03] <shoky> because you can only bind event handlers on elements that already exist in the DOM
[08:21:11] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Is there away around that?
[08:21:14] <shoky> (such as #wrapper)
[08:21:27] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: the other way would be to bind each box as you create it ..
[08:21:38] <shoky> but that's not recommended/efficient
[08:21:46] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: How would that look like in that example?
[08:21:53] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: I don't really think I have any other choices
[08:23:07] <shoky> DeltaHeavy like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/aynrs/3/
[08:23:32] <shoky> why do you think you dont have a choice
[08:23:39] <DeltaHeavy> Probably cause I don't understand this 100% TBH
[08:23:45] <DeltaHeavy> Let me get the HTML
[08:24:17] <youngin> yo pachet whats up man
[08:24:26] <youngin> pachet: allow me to pm
[08:25:26] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: This won't work but it should show you waht I'm trying to do. I'm populating custom dropboxes dynamically: http://jsfiddle.net/PrGjW/
[08:26:30] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Do I want to attach the .on event to 'form-drop_wrapper'?
[08:27:07] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: i dont know.. donno what you're doing with that HTML
[08:27:52] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: thanks, but unfort I can't do like that. I have to use raw html I get from a server
[08:28:33] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Are there any really easy tutorials that will expalin .on to me like I'm 3?
[08:28:52] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, other day i read about some DOMParser() but, i doubt it works in IE
[08:29:49] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOMParser
[08:30:26] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Anytime one of those .sel-smalls are clicked it will populate a DIFFERENT div with other .sel-smalls that need to be clicked. That's the gist of it.
[08:32:50] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: what is the common root for all the .sel-smalls ?
[08:33:32] <DeltaHeavy> .form-drop_wrapper. I think I got it working but now it's coming up with '$(this).attr('id')' as unefined when I do it.
[08:34:02] <shoky> but you said that a DIFFERENT div will also get populated with .sel-smalls ..
[08:34:20] <CodeMonkey> Can someone take a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/KGxnC/1/ <- In my second .each loop, I' looping through the collection of rows and looking at the 8th element, which I would expect to look like "Prealgebra A1" or similar. But, it's outputting the value for all rows concatenated together.
[08:34:23] <shoky> or is that also .from-drop_wrapper
[08:34:35] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: It's also a .form-drop_wrapper
[08:35:21] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: and this other .form-drop_wrapper , is it only added to the DOM at runtime, like the sel-smalls that go in it ?
[08:36:24] <shoky> CodeMonkey: make a working fiddle
[08:38:17] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: No, it's already there.
[08:38:43] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: I think I may have got it, still playing around with it so you might want to hold off so I'm not wasting your time.
[08:38:43] <CodeMonkey> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/KGxnC/8/
[08:38:47] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: then $('.form-drop_wrapper').on('click', '.sel-small', function() { ... } )
[08:40:03] <CodeMonkey> shoky: I would expect the alerts to show "Prealgebra A1", then the next one to be "Prealgebra A3:, etc.
[08:40:32] <Archer_xda> Onkeltem - what is it you need to do?  I've done some work parsing raw HTML before
[08:41:08] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Thanks! It's working, just some other weird errors now but I think I can figure it out
[08:41:20] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, if you have please share, because i could use it
[08:42:04] <shoky> CodeMonkey: you have newrows090A  instead of this
[08:42:28] <CodeMonkey> shoky: OOOohhhhh! Duh. Thanks
[08:42:31] <hariom> I am retrieving search results from and upon clicking on one of the search links, I get access to the post. But when I click on the back button of the browser I don't get to the search page again. I am using Ajax to get the search results. How to ensure that browser back button takes to the search results again
[08:42:33] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_ depends what you need
[08:42:47] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_ I've not seen any of the previous conversation you 2 were having
[08:43:43] <pachet> ?g mdn history @ hariom
[08:43:44] <caniuse> hariom: Manipulating the browser history - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[08:44:00] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, what i am looking for is something similar to DOMParser() ..
[08:44:13] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, .. what Onkeltem is working on is widget using ajax, but getting synchronization issues, (html loads before stylesheet is applied)
[08:45:05] <CodeMonkey> So, that takes me to the next step. Given the string 'Prealgebra A1', I want to just strip off and look at 'A1'. Would split be my best option? Or should I substr?
[08:45:13] <hariom> caniuse: How do I know that use has pressed back button?
[08:45:47] <hariom> caniuse: Does this works in majority (leading) browsers or only in FF?
[08:46:20] <kollapse> Hi. I have a <select> element. Is there any way I can bind a function to the .change() event, but only when the change is done by mouse ?
[08:46:31] <kollapse> Because with a select field, you can change the value with both the mouse and the keyboard.
[08:46:48] <pachet> not reliably
[08:48:55] <kollapse> pachet: The solution would be too... 'dirty' ?
[08:50:53] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_ - You can load the raw html into a hidden div.  Once it's loaded copy the html out and apply it where it's needed.  The css will already have been applied at that point
[08:54:28] <fuchstronaut> (kollapse): as you can alter the options with arrow-keys, you could bind events to mouseclick and arrow-keys to see what was used last when the change-event is fired
[08:55:16] <CodeMonkey> How do I parse out just 'A1' from 'Prealgebra A1'? Split or substring or something else?
[08:55:30] <snover> that depends upon so much.
[08:55:41] <snover> you haven’t given anyone any pattern to work with.
[08:56:00] <shoky> var t = 'A1'  works.
[08:56:52] <pachet> ?eval 'Prealgebra A1'.split(' ')[1]
[08:56:52] <caniuse> pachet: 'A1'
[08:57:10] <pachet> it really just depends on how certain you are that the strings will follow a certain pattern
[08:57:25] <arungpt> hey guys, i have what might be a weird

[08:57:32] <snover> IF I HAVE A SENTENCE HOW DO I PARSE OUT JUST THE ANIMALS FROM IT
[08:57:43] <shoky> no eval plz.
[08:57:53] <pachet> snover: $.findAnimals(mystring)
[08:58:02] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, so can you tell something related to raw html parsing?
[08:58:13] <shoky> arungpt that IS a weird
[08:58:19] <arungpt> :-)
[08:58:30] <arungpt> accidental return
[08:58:44] <arungpt> though it also made me rethink my question haha
[08:58:45] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_  Why don't you tell me what you're trying to do and what problem you are facing?
[08:59:28] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_  Help me to help you ;)
[09:00:51] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, i am using ajax to download text/html, but, i can't load it straight into a Node because it includes links to various scripts & stylesheets
[09:01:28] <k1t> hey folks, anyone know how I might clean up this simple but ugly bit of codes? https://gist.github.com/9d4da237fad0ed06428e
[09:01:48] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, so i want to parse <head> items and use them bit differently
[09:01:49] <silverwind> Start by removing duplication..
[09:02:02] <silverwind> k1t,
[09:02:24] <k1t> silverwind: yes?
[09:02:33] <k1t> =P
[09:02:41] <silverwind> k1t, the first thing would be to remove the useless duplication.
[09:02:53] <silverwind> k1t, any DOM access is slow, try to avoid them when possible.
[09:03:12] <k1t> target.parents()s and .siblings()s?
[09:03:30] <silverwind> Yeah, assign them to variables.
[09:04:53] <silverwind> You can also "merge" line 7 and 8 with chaining
[09:04:57] <pachet> k1t: https://gist.github.com/2910851
[09:05:04] <k1t> i updated https://gist.github.com/9d4da237fad0ed06428e
[09:05:12] <k1t> ah yeah pachet lol
[09:05:19] <k1t> still thought, it seems a bit ugly..
[09:05:39] <juanlas> can someone tell me what the type of selector is where I have a second argument, like: $('td.text', arg2)
[09:06:00] <pachet> juanlas: context
[09:06:27] <shoky> k1t: you can chain stuff.. e.g. parent.removeClass('zoomable').addClass('zoomed-in')
[09:06:31] <pachet> $('.foo', bar) will return dom elements with class .foo contained within bar
[09:06:45] <silverwind> juanlas, The node where jQuery starts looking, by default, it's the document
[09:06:56] <shoky> k1t: parentSib.addClass(...).removeClass(...).children('a').removeClass(...)
[09:07:09] <juanlas> ah i see thank you
[09:07:10] <silverwind> juanlas, $)
[09:07:13] <silverwind> err
[09:07:21] <shoky> oh pachet did it for you already
[09:07:36] <shoky> though he has a typo ; p
[09:08:08] <silverwind> juanlas,  $(selector).find(selector2)   is the same as $(selector2, $(selector));
[09:08:20] <k1t> https://gist.github.com/9d4da237fad0ed06428e much better
[09:08:24] <k1t> with chaining thx guys
[09:08:33] <k1t> and better vars, of course
[09:08:47] <pachet> shoky: oh lol, good eye
[09:08:59] <silverwind> parentSib could be better...
[09:09:04] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_ So what's the problem?
[09:09:09] <shoky> parent.removeClass('zoomable').addClass('zoomed-in').siblings().removeClass('zoomed-in').addClass('zoomable').children('a').removeClass('selected');  ;DDDD
[09:09:26] <pachet> chain of the gods
[09:09:42] <silverwind> k1t, avoid touching the DOM when you can... parentSib could be parent.siblings()
[09:10:12] <silverwind> k1t, since you already selected the parent and stored it in the "parent" variable
[09:10:18] <juanlas> makes sense, thanks again silverwind
[09:10:56] <CodeMonkey> if I have a nested .each loop, and I refer to '$(this)' within each, is that ok? Will jQuery scope that correctly?
[09:12:10] <Whirl3d> $ each @ CodeMonkey
[09:12:13] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, i am looking for best way to parse that response html. so i can create an array with all links in it ..
[09:12:24] <Whirl3d> ? .each @ Code
[09:12:30] <dipser> is it possible to change/replace a node.textContent to a html-dom element?
[09:12:31] <silverwind> CodeMonkey, the this changes with every function... it will work as you expect until you need to access the outer each "this"
[09:12:31] <CodeMonkey> one more time
[09:12:36] <Whirl3d> brb my keybork is a wreck...
[09:13:29] <CodeMonkey> silverwind: Here's the idea: http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/
[09:13:49] <Whirl3d> Must've fallen asleep with food on my keyboard
[09:13:50] <CodeMonkey> I'm looping through rows and rows of an html table
[09:14:09] <Whirl3d> CodeMonkey, you could use $.each()
[09:14:23] <Whirl3d> in which case $(this) maintains it's context
[09:14:44] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/ can you show me?
[09:15:07] <Whirl3d> put some html in there and it'll be a lot easier.
[09:15:23] <CodeMonkey> k
[09:16:24] <CodeMonkey> http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/1/ <- a working, nonworking example :)
[09:16:36] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_ if you can't convert it to something you can parse then you're stuck with string manipulation.  Find the body tags - look for <body and </body and take everything between - set that as HTML for a div you create yourself and you can then use jQuery to parse that
[09:16:42] <Whirl3d> are you using .add instead of .append...or do you intend to use .add
[09:17:04] <Archer_xda> _helpPlz_ It all depends on how much you can rely on the html.  If it's likely to change, or out of your control then there is never going to be a foolproof answer
[09:17:14] <CodeMonkey> newrowsAll is empty to begin with. I thought .Add was appropriate
[09:17:20] <xarxer> $("a.foo") is used to target anchors with class foo.. Is it possible to target anchors that doesn NOT have a certain class?
[09:18:22] <pachet> ?.not @ xarxer
[09:18:39] <pachet> bleh
[09:19:13] <CodeMonkey> I would expect to see newrowsAll getting populated with the existing rows at least. But nothing is output
[09:19:17] <Whirl3d> what are newsrows090a, b, etc.
[09:20:02] <xarxer> pachet: :)
[09:20:08] <pachet> xarxer: $('a:not(.foo)')
[09:20:20] <pachet> apparently the bots are on holiday
[09:20:33] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: they will hold other rows from the table. I can add some more HTML with a much bigger table
[09:20:56] <xarxer> pachet: Thanks :)
[09:21:00] <CodeMonkey> newrows090A holds all rows from the original table that are MAT090
[09:21:07] <CodeMonkey> newrows090A holds all rows from the original table that are MAT090A
[09:21:19] <CodeMonkey> newrows090B holds all rows from the original table that are MAT090B, etc
[09:22:06] <Whirl3d> .add only adds items to a jquery collection.it doesn't append the item to the dom.
[09:22:42] <CodeMonkey> I can't modify the code that produces the HTML for this page due to policy and red tape. But, I need to reorder the rows and group MAT 090A, MAT 090B, and MAT 090C instead of all A's, then all B's, etc
[09:22:43] <_helpPlz_> Archer_xda, ok thanks i will see what i can do.
[09:24:03] <Whirl3d> lol it helps if I comment out your code. I couldn't see anything in the tables.
[09:24:20] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: If I remove the 2nd .each loop, and do "insertAfter.after(newrows090A);" at the bottom, it works fine. Add seems to be doing what I want
[09:24:29] <CodeMonkey> :)
[09:24:49] <Whirl3d> that's because insertAfter appends to the dom
[09:24:55] <grabanski> anyone have experience with CORS?
[09:24:56] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: Basically, that code should be grabbing all rows, detaching them, then simply redisplaying them
[09:25:19] <Whirl3d> and right now there are 4 rows, correct?
[09:25:19] <_helpPlz_> CodeMonkey, i think you can avoid unnecessary looping
[09:25:21] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: right, and I'm doing the insertAfter with newrowsAll
[09:26:03] <CodeMonkey> _helpPlz_: let me throw up some more HTML and I'll explain
[09:27:44] <CodeMonkey> http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/9/
[09:28:13] <CodeMonkey> That has 090A, 090B and 090C in it now. Notice how the 090A's are all grouped at the top?
[09:28:22] <tgm> Great afternoon, I am looking for docs about whether there is a delete/remove callback for domelements. I don't see it on http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/ so I'm assuming it's not possible
[09:29:33] <CodeMonkey> Instead, I need 090A Prealgebra A1. The next row should be 090B Prealgebra B1. The next row should be 090C Prealgebra C1.  A,B,C instead of A,A,A,B,B,B,C,C,C....
[09:30:34] <CodeMonkey> Does that make sense? Or am I making it more confusing?
[09:36:30] <Whirl3d> CodeMoneky, just sort your table by CRN
[09:41:24] <tomoyuki28jp> xhr.abort() sometimes triggers ajax.fail() callback. How can I fix it?
[09:41:28] <Onkeltem> Archer_xda: what I was doing is now ruined anyway by IE :)
[09:41:53] <Onkeltem> crap
[09:42:38] <Onkeltem> Drupal needs more control over loading content then it has now
[09:43:16] <Onkeltem> and PHP is not so good for ajax-applications too
[09:43:30] <DeltaHeavy> How is PHP crap for that?
[09:43:45] <Onkeltem> DeltaHeavy: not PHP, it was about IE.
[09:44:09] <DeltaHeavy> Onkeltem: IE + PHP = Crap O_o?
[09:44:39] <Onkeltem> DeltaHeavy: IE = crap, PHP + Ajax = might be better :)
[09:44:40] <Whirl3d> CodeMonkey, does this help? If not exactly like this, it might still help: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mGMNw/18/
[09:44:47] <DeltaHeavy> Onkeltem: Oh ok sorry T_T
[09:45:56] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: how do I get it to sort?
[09:46:04] <Onkeltem> DeltaHeavy: back to PHP. Well, I have 10 pieces of content which I load using 10 anync ajax requests. Each piece may produce additional CSS when rendering in PHP. And if so, it returns it in ajax response. (to be cont)
[09:46:06] <Whirl3d> click any of the headers
[09:46:22] <CodeMonkey> oh, neat!
[09:46:34] <Whirl3d> so, I think you want to sort by CRN
[09:46:52] <Whirl3d> but, you might need to make a custom header column to apply the exact sort method you want
[09:47:08] <Onkeltem> DeltaHeavy: so, the problem I got into is: each of 10 pieces produce same additional CSS. And I can't at PHP side effectively distinguish whether a piece already been sent
[09:47:11] <Whirl3d> then hide it and manually trigger the sort or just use the sortElements
[09:47:55] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: I think you are right, the CRN sort might just work
[09:48:40] <Onkeltem> DeltaHeavy: I never tried it out, but suppose NodeJS suits more for solving such a task...
[09:50:12] <xckpd7> question: I'm trying to build something with jQuery on my computer. trying to do something like #('header').load('../index.html header')
[09:50:17] <xckpd7> but I get an error: Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[09:52:00] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: I need to verify sorting by CRN will work. There may be occasions where a lab was added at a point in the future and the CRNs could be off.
[09:52:55] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: Or maybe a new class is created, and assigned older labs, in which the A record would come after the C records with CRNs
[09:54:04] <Whirl3d> still you should be able to figure it out with the fiddle I showed you, right. You may have to create a new column with sort criteria, but it should be pretty simple from here.
[09:58:27] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: I think you are right, but I may need an example of adding a new column and specifying my own sort criteria. But we can burn that bridge when I here back from the person wanting this
[09:58:57] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: AND, I can use that code on my personal site.... very cool!
[10:02:23] <CodeMonkey> Just because I want to understand what I'm doing wrong, here's a stripped down version of my previous code. Why isn't the insertAfter outputting the 090A records?
[10:02:54] <CodeMonkey> http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/21/
[10:04:00] <CodeMonkey> Even more stripped down: http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/22/
[10:06:02] <CodeMonkey> it's like the 2nd .each loop isn't being ran
[10:11:39] <xckpd7> how do you load a particular section of a page, passing a variable in first as the page to be loaded?
[10:11:52] <xckpd7>                   $('section').load(url 'section'); // load the html response into a DOM element
[10:12:11] <xckpd7> that code is invalid
[10:13:14] <sanova> hi
[10:15:16] <shoky> xckpd7: url is a string.  + is for concatenating strings into a single string
[10:15:23] <sanova> is there a way to have datatable auto height ? dataTables_wrapper and dataTables__scrollBody don't get correct 100% height
[10:31:55] <vl1234> hi hi
[10:32:13] <vl1234> testarray result both the var declare groble and var testarray = ["abc", "", " asd", "", "cfg"] and result should be var result=  ["abc", " asd", "cfg"]
[10:33:02] <vl1234> testarray result both the var declare globaland var testarray = ["abc", "", " asd", "", "cfg"] and result should be var result= ["abc", " asd", "cfg"]
[10:33:16] <vl1234> any 1 have idea about that
[10:35:02] <shoky> vl1234: var result = $.grep(testarray, function(a) { return a.length > 0 })
[10:35:41] <vl1234> grep is a one function in jquery ha
[10:36:00] <shoky> ha
[10:37:49] <vl1234> function(a) in that a means
[10:37:58] <vl1234> function(a) in that "a" means
[10:38:24] <CodeMonkey> shoky: Can you take a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/mGMNw/27/ < nothing is being output at the bottom. and it seems newrowsAll doesn't get populated in the 2nd .each loop
[10:39:06] <vl1234> @shoky function(a) in that "a" means
[10:39:50] <shoky> vl1234: it's just the name i gave to the parameter. it'll be equal to each of the array elements, each time the function is called for an element
[10:40:19] <vl1234> k fine
[10:40:38] <shoky> CodeMonkey: you forgot newRowsAll = newRowsAll.add(...
[10:40:51] <CodeMonkey> shoky: gah! thanks

[11:15:44] <w4cko> i am having a very odd issue only in FF, where a button on my page is given a disabled state not by my code but by the browser. and it doesnt start off disabled, it becomes disabled only when the page is loaded again in the same session or tab
[11:16:21] <w4cko> for instance if i open it again in another tab it will not be disabled. if i refresh it becomes disabled. url: http://eq4.net/hive/
[11:16:41] <w4cko> only code i have pertaining to this button is $('#change_banner').live('click', function () { $ul_dialog.dialog("open"); }); // has anyone seen or heard of such an issue?
[11:17:31] <w4cko> this isnt jquery related per se i just figured someone here may have seen this before. it seems odd to me that a browser would ever make a dynamic change to my code like this and there is no explanation for why this button
[11:19:49] <Whirl3d> w4cko, without seeing your code, there's no way to tell. Post some code at jsfiddle.net and I'd be willing to be that someone can help
[11:23:16] <CodeMonkey> I'm doing a $(this).detach(); from a collection of rows from a table, but the detach isn't actually removing it from the collection. .remove didn't work either. How do I remove it completely from the collection?
[11:23:38] <w4cko> http://eq4.net/hive/js/hive.js is the code
[11:24:24] <w4cko> but none of it applies any changes to this button. in fact if i make another button next to it and give it the same exact Id and and give the affected button a different ID, FF still disables it
[11:26:16] <Whirl3d> CodeMonkey, detach and remove are dom-methods, not collection methods..per se. If you have an element in a jquery collection and remove or detach, it stays aailable in the jquery collection.
[11:27:40] <w4cko> i can fix this from happening by dynamically removing the disabled attribute in my JS code. but i would just like to know how/why a browser would decide to do this
[11:28:36] <w4cko> i am using FF12, ive had other test and they had the same results.
[11:30:31] <w4cko> im not sure other than the HTML presentation at the provided URL what code in particular to place on jsfiddle since none of it pertains to this button except for the line i posted which simply opens a dialog
[11:31:13] <w4cko> i thought maybe firefox didnt like my id name of "change_banner" so i renamed it. it still disabled it... its like FF has decided it doesnt like this button :)
[11:31:37] <w4cko> or rather it likes it the first time around but then the honeymoon is over
[11:31:54] <CodeMonkey> Whirl3d: so can I completely remove it from the collection?
[11:33:00] <Whirl3d> coll=coll.not(itemtoremove);
[11:34:05] <CodeMonkey> thx
[11:34:26] <Whirl3d> w4cko, what version of jquery?
[11:36:02] <w4cko> 1.7
[11:36:13] <Whirl3d> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6074529/disabled-attribute-does-not-work-in-firefox-for-a-div
[11:38:06] <w4cko> interesting but i am not even disabling the button
[11:38:14] <MagmaRules> Hi there, has anyone used atreq for dependency loading?
[11:38:27] <w4cko> the problem is its getting disabled on its own and i guarentee there is not a single line of code referencing this button telling it to do so
[11:41:41] <w4cko> i did not know about using "true" in jq 1.6+ so thats good to know
[11:42:29] <Whirl3d> try stripping all the js from your doc and see if it still happens. If not, add each script until it happens and then the last one is your problem script
[11:47:17] <w4cko> i actually just tried that, still no effect
[11:47:24] <w4cko> but stripping all my CSS from it did work
[11:47:51] <shoky> w4cko: first of all the button isn't disabled
[11:48:17] <w4cko> what version of firefox are you using and did you hit refresh after the initial loading?
[11:48:27] <shoky> hm or is it
[11:48:32] <shoky> its got disabled=""  attribute
[11:49:36] <w4cko> but the original html doesnt have it disabled and none of my code disables it. and in fact even after stripping all my javascript from it
[11:51:16] <shoky> i think bootstrap is causing it.. donno
[11:51:53] <w4cko> but for it to only happen after page refresh?
[11:52:07] <w4cko> and only in FF
[11:52:13] <w4cko> (as far as i know)
[11:53:00] <w4cko> i just removed the twitter boostrap CSS and it still disables it
[11:55:32] <w4cko> and correction even after stripping ALL css it gets disabled...
[11:55:36] <w4cko> madness
[11:55:49] <thomedy> i have an efficiency question to decide which event to call
[11:55:53] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[11:56:02] <thomedy> click on link and then it expands into a new page
[11:56:14] <thomedy> now the question at hand is i have a set of links that show on the top
[11:56:15] <Whirl3d> w4cko, clear your ff cache and try it
[11:57:01] <thomedy> i am considering event.target with an if statement to decide which page to slide open to again or i am considering series of clicks which sounds slower and less effective
[11:57:03] <thomedy> thoughts?
[11:57:42] <Whirl3d> huh?
[11:57:51] <thomedy> was taht for me whirl3d
[11:58:02] <Whirl3d> yeah. What are you asking?
[11:58:06] <thomedy> did you go to the page
[11:58:12] <Whirl3d> yes
[11:58:21] <thomedy> did you click on one of the sub links in men or women
[11:58:38] <Whirl3d> yes
[11:58:49] <thomedy> okay do you see the three letters in the top left corner
[11:58:54] <Whirl3d> yes
[11:59:00] <thomedy> okay my question is would it be bettter
[11:59:13] <thomedy> to do an event.target with an if statement based on class name
[11:59:19] <w4cko> whirl3d: surprisingly after clearing cache and refreshing its disabled. but as usual open a new tab and load the page for the first time and its enabled again (until refresh)
[11:59:22] <thomedy> that would decide which page to slide open
[11:59:25] <w4cko> i am not crazy right?
[11:59:32] <thomedy> those navigate through the slides eventually
[11:59:40] <thomedy> im just trying to make it as smooth as possible
[11:59:44] <thomedy> im leaning toward
[11:59:51] <Whirl3d> thomedy, shouldn't that be handled by your menu
[11:59:54] <thomedy> (classname).click
[12:00:23] <thomedy> function e --> event target if target is ''whatever'' then slide this page
[12:00:59] <Whirl3d> or better yet, use hashchange to monitor changes in the hash and open the pages accordingly. This will allow you to do bookmarking as well
[12:01:17] <relipse> my girlfriend broke up with me and then told me there has to be a lot of changes, i asked her the changes and then she won't respond to me?
[12:01:30] <Whirl3d> currently, If I want to send a link to Lady Skirts to my mom, I can't
[12:01:37] <thomedy> oh thats amazing what the h did you just say
[12:01:51] <w4cko> relipse: she wants you to start using zepto
[12:01:53] <thomedy> hash changes
[12:01:57] <relipse> what the heck is zepto
[12:01:58] <Whirl3d> using the hashchange event, i can send her yoursite.com?q=ladies-skirts
[12:02:04] <thomedy> or would you rather me google it
[12:02:19] <w4cko> relipse, http://zeptojs.com/
[12:02:29] <Whirl3d> thomedy, look up .bbq
[12:02:32] <Whirl3d> ? .bbq
[12:02:34] <thomedy> okay.bbq
[12:02:35] <w4cko> surely the changes she speaks of are jquery related
[12:02:51] <thomedy> really? thats a weird google but ill do it
[12:03:28] <Whirl3d> ben allmen has written a jquery plugin to handle the hashchange event and history bookmarking, etc. Its really full featured and it can take th eplace of your navitgation
[12:03:48] <Whirl3d> plus it lets you setup links anywhere in your content to any other content on your site really easily.
[12:04:58] <Whirl3d> w4cko, it's gotta be a firefox extension you have running or perhaps a virus...
[12:05:14] <w4cko> but its not only happening to me
[12:05:20] <w4cko> ive had 3 others verify this
[12:05:38] <w4cko> and in fact i have no extensions installed
[12:05:44] <w4cko> except firebug
[12:05:57] <Whirl3d> shouldn't you bring this up in #mozilla or #firefox
[12:06:04] <Whirl3d> if you really think it's an issue
[12:06:04] <w4cko> i suppose so
[12:06:21] <thomedy> that looks dope thank you
[12:09:59] <w4cko> im relatively inexperienced so i figured it was something i was doing/not doing and it would be obvious but alas this defies all logic
[12:10:44] <Whirl3d> thomedy. I actually just use the hashchange plugin because I prefer to encode my own hashes using a much simpler nomenclature, but still, it's a great resource.
[12:12:14] <thomedy> okay i would rather write my own hash change thing
[12:12:31] <thomedy> because that concept is awesome but i hate relying on people to write my code
[12:12:50] <Whirl3d> Yeah, so just manage the hashchange event (especially on load) and it will run native in HTML5 browsers...use the plugin for fallback.
[12:12:52] <thomedy> i know i have  conflict of interest but now i have knowledge to google hash changes so thank you
[12:13:09] <thomedy> im really psyched you showed me that thank you
[12:13:40] <Whirl3d> The thing you want to remember is that you need a flag variable to remind yourself that you updated the hash intentionally...
[12:13:54] <Whirl3d> in other words, your anchor elements change the hash, triggering the handler.
[12:14:07] <Whirl3d> you decipher the hash and open the content...piece of cake.
[12:14:31] <Whirl3d> but sometimes you navigate to new content, without triggering the hash update. You need to do that manually (to enable back/history)...
[12:14:48] <thomedy> seriously amazing thank you sooooooo muchg
[12:14:53] <thomedy> brb
[12:24:51] <cody__> is it possible to pass the name of a method to call on an object? $('a').this_needs_to_be_dynamic('setActiveDataSet', name);
[12:25:41] <cody__> so i could call something like do_something('foo') and execute $('a').foo('setActiveDataSet', name);
[12:30:38] <jaesun> what will $('a[title="foo"]') give me if there is no link with title=foo?
[12:38:58] <Whirl3d> it will return an empty set
[12:39:52] <Whirl3d> cody_ no. You are probably responding to the way that some plugins facilitate access to methods.
[12:40:40] <Whirl3d> a plugin named foo can be accessed on an element by $(element).foo(params)   so some plugins allow you to call methods of .foo by $(element).foo(method, opts)
[12:54:44] <Whirl3d> When writing a plugin, you can use the $.extend(plugin.prototype, newMethods) concept to add methods to your plugin. But how do you access those methods from the "core" of your plugin? How does the un-extended plugin have access to it's methods in the constructor before they are added?
[12:57:44] <noobiewan> Hello friends. I have a jQuery object and I want to get it converted to HTML. I can't use .append() or .appendTo() I need something like .html() but it strips the outermost tag of the HTML. How can I retrieve it fully?
[12:58:24] <silverwind> noobiewan, append it to some div and .html() it?
[13:00:28] <noobiewan> silverwind, that will probably work :)
[13:01:40] <noobiewan> silverwind, I just don't understand why there is no such function.
[13:02:20] <silverwind> noobiewan, some browsers have .outerHTML for that... but it's not universally supported
[13:02:30] <silverwind> (It's a pure DOM function, not jQuery)
[13:03:50] <noobiewan> silverwind, what's happening is that I'm creating a jQuery object and need to pass the HTML to a function and not directly to the DOM. That's why I can't use appendTo()
[13:04:47] <silverwind> Why would your function takes HTML?
[13:05:09] <noobiewan> google maps api
[13:05:22] <silverwind> I never used it :/
[13:05:40] <noobiewan> it's like a setContent() function
[13:05:52] <noobiewan> you need to pass the HTML content and it will take care of displaying it
[13:06:10] <silverwind> Ah ok :) I get it
[13:09:52] <z0ned> assume i have 10 input text boxes. is there some selector i can use to grab the one that is currently focused?
[13:10:27] <ColKurtz> :focus
[13:10:30] <ColKurtz> iirc
[13:11:34] <kollapse> z0ned: Something like var current; $('input').focus(function(){ current = $(this); })
[13:11:57] <Whirl3d> anybody know how to get mIRC to stop dislaying every comment in a popup on the taskbar?
[13:12:24] <Whirl3d> or just var current=(":focus");
[13:12:32] <Whirl3d> $(":focus");
[13:12:54] <CoolDawg> Can I just jquery mobile to develop mobile apps?
[13:12:56] <thomedy> i cant figure out why i have a blink of white space... please help
[13:13:00] <z0ned> Whirl3d, that isn't working for me
[13:13:02] <CoolDawg> Or would I have to use another framework?
[13:13:03] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[13:13:06] <Whirl3d> $(element).focus() triggers the focus event on the element
[13:13:21] <z0ned> Whirl3d, or is it losing focus because i have to click the dev tools window
[13:13:35] <Whirl3d> z0ned, paste some code to jsfiddle and I'll give it a look
[13:13:59] <Whirl3d> CoolDawg, depends on what you want to do. Sure you can develop a mobile app in jquery.
[13:14:02] <z0ned> Whirl3d, all I'm doing is clicking on a text box, then typing $("input:focus") into the console and its returning []
[13:14:49] <Whirl3d> because you are losing focus by clicking on the console?
[13:15:17] <Whirl3d> try $("input").focus(function () { console.log$(":focus")});
[13:15:49] <Whirl3d> that sets the focus handler to tell the console to log the element with focus
[13:16:13] <Whirl3d> thomedy, I can't remember the exact place to look, but it's something like fuoc
[13:16:30] <thomedy> that looks like cussing... i dont understand
[13:16:33] <Whirl3d> flash of unformatted content...fouc...something like that on jquery api
[13:16:39] <thomedy> okay gott it
[13:17:35] <shoky> thomedy: why do you bind a click handler inside a mouseenter handler ?
[13:18:03] <Whirl3d> lol
[13:18:09] <shoky> thomedy: line 15 http://www.thesartorer.com/sites/all/themes/web-hold/script.js?Q
[13:18:37] <z0ned> Whirl3d, still logs []
[13:19:00] <scotdb> Another JQuery UI tabs with IE question unfortunately : why do tabs with hrefs to local locations (e.g. #mytab1) work but tabs with hrefs which are php scripts not (but work perfectly in Firefox and Chrome)
[13:20:06] <scotdb> ... and would creating a local div with a php include work ?
[13:21:14] <thomedy> it made sense i didn't put alot of thought into it i just figured i would click the link only if i was in the div
[13:21:26] <z0ned> <input id="test" />   $("#test").focus(function(){ console.log($(":focus")); });    *click input*    logs: []
[13:21:27] <thomedy> if thats not right or innefficent im mallable/learnable
[13:21:34] <shoky> thomedy: thats not right
[13:21:43] * thomedy is listening
[13:21:50] <shoky> thomedy: you're binding ANOTHER click handler EACH time you mouseenter ...
[13:22:07] <thomedy> so just put it outside then?
[13:22:08] <shoky> actually probably more than one each time, cause you're doing it on all <a>'s
[13:22:21] <shoky> thomedy: probably. i dont know what functionality you want from your site
[13:22:33] <thomedy> well taht will eventually change to most a's but but still your point is applicable
[13:22:55] <thomedy> let me change that now and hten move on to learning more about fuocs
[13:23:27] <z0ned> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/Exrcn/
[13:23:28] <Whirl3d> thomedy, the joy of using the hashchange event is that you don't need to manage the click event on any anchors that have content locations stored in their hrefs
[13:23:33] <z0ned> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/Exrcn/
[13:23:50] <shoky> z0ned it works
[13:24:12] <z0ned> shoky, when you click in the box what does your console log? mine logs []
[13:24:21] <shoky> well it works some of the times
[13:24:31] <thomedy> i was going to hash change later because right now im just getting the animations to work before i make the functionality there
[13:24:45] <Whirl3d> the focus event happens after the click event
[13:24:45] <thomedy> it made sense cuz i assumed hash changes would have nothing to do  with the style
[13:25:07] <Whirl3d> so add a 1 second timeout and it'll work
[13:25:07] <z0ned> doesn't work if i use tab to focus it either
[13:25:33] <thomedy> i figured it out
[13:25:36] <thomedy> its not a fuoc
[13:25:49] <thomedy> its the width of the screen folding the float left to the bottome i think
[13:26:04] <z0ned> even if i programmatically call $("#test").focus() it doesn't work.....
[13:26:08] <thomedy> yeah tahts it
[13:26:20] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Exrcn/2/
[13:27:00] <shoky> 0 would work too ;P
[13:27:21] <Whirl3d> yep
[13:27:27] <z0ned> Whirl3d, that's not a good solutio.... is this the only way?
[13:27:43] <shoky> z0ned and this works too http://jsfiddle.net/Exrcn/4/
[13:28:11] <Whirl3d> shoky, that doesn't work for tab
[13:28:33] <shoky> yap
[13:28:55] <shoky> z0ned: why is it not a good solution?  (with timeout 0)
[13:31:00] <shoky> z0ned and there's also this: http://jsfiddle.net/Exrcn/5/
[13:31:05] <z0ned> i have a group of 5 input boxes. when a user types in one of them, depending waht the type, the next box will either be focused, or disabled. but i need to know which box they started from (they don't have to start at #1) so i need to know which one is focused. also, depending on other things on the page, the input can programmatically be focused. so click, keypress, timeout, won't work.
[13:31:46] <shoky> yeah i asked about whirl3d's fiddle, not mine
[13:32:10] <Whirl3d> timeout shouldn't affect any of that.
[13:32:30] <z0ned> yeah, but it makes it lag. 5 seconds to type in 5 boxes?
[13:32:39] <Whirl3d> make it 0
[13:32:40] <shoky> huh
[13:32:52] <Whirl3d> setTimeout(function () {do stuff{, 0);
[13:33:07] <Whirl3d> I just said 1000 to demonstrate...0 works better
[13:33:18] <z0ned> ahhh
[13:34:22] <z0ned> i still don't understand why that's necessary in the case of calling input.focus() programmatically
[13:34:38] <John> Hey
[13:34:50] <John> oooooh - qUery
[13:34:53] <John> sorry
[13:35:13] <shoky> z0ned: because the focus() handler is probably called before the :focus selector would work
[13:35:27] <shoky> z0ned: even in the only example in the docs for :focus, they use setTimeout
[13:40:32] <N3tw0rK> http://jsfiddle.net/GkHu9/33/ why after doing a search (number 2000) you have to click the map button twice before it does anything?
[13:41:06] <N3tw0rK> I assume its because the button is generated via javascript and therefore it is registered on the first click and executed on the second....but i dont know how to fix it
[13:44:09] <z0ned> why would you have your server generate the html? let the JS do that, and if you create the element with jquery, you can attach a click handler. just have the server return the lat/lng coords
[13:45:01] <noobiewan> N3tw0rK, I tried and I didn't have to click twice
[13:45:14] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, i did. maybe its a browser ting
[13:45:21] <N3tw0rK> noobiewan: what browser?
[13:45:23] <Whirl3d> couldn't get 2 letters typed in the input.
[13:45:25] <noobiewan> N3tw0rK, sorry MAP button
[13:45:33] <N3tw0rK> ya :)
[13:45:46] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: try numbers
[13:46:12] <Whirl3d> I see.
[13:46:49] <noobiewan> N3tw0rK, instead of using click() use on()
[13:46:50] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, i still think you should use jquery to create the html, and attach click handlers to the buttons. instead of letting the server write it and using onclick
[13:48:09] <noobiewan> N3tw0rK, I found the problem
[13:48:35] <Whirl3d> dont' use inline click handlers
[13:48:44] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, you're calling mapit(), and THEN setting the click handlers for the .mapit class
[13:48:46] <noobiewan> N3tw0rK, you have an onclick event on the button tag. That calls a function that binds an event to the button.
[13:48:46] * Whirl3d shudders
[13:49:39] <noobiewan> N3tw0rK, remove this from the mapit function $(".mapit").click(function() { and let the code inside it
[13:49:48] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, you really should have your server return a JSON object, then parse it out in jquery and append the proper html.
[13:50:51] <z0ned> this is very bad design..
[13:51:46] <scotdb> I think my PHP script from tabs problem is because my php script passes a parameter ...
[13:51:48] <scotdb>     <li><a href="fm-shop.php?fid=<?php echo $_GET['fid']; ?>">Shop</a></li>
[13:52:24] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: thanks :) this is my first attempt at "AJAX", what would you suggest for a better design?
[13:53:02] <w4cko> Whirl3d, i traced the problem to a specific point in my code where i have document.getElementById('add_tab').disabled = true;
[13:53:19] <w4cko> but this must be returning the wrong element ID because an element with the id "change_banner" ends up disabled as well..
[13:53:42] <Whirl3d> you said that you didn't have any code running, wtf?
[13:53:44] <w4cko> and only on the second page load... so this is a FF bug most likely?
[13:54:06] <w4cko> i removed the code and the problem persisted but i didnt remove it, load it in a new tab and then reload it
[13:54:11] <Whirl3d> N3tw0rK, look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GkHu9/36/
[13:54:13] <scotdb> Even <li><a href="fm-shop.php?fid=4510">Shop</a></li> doesn't work ...
[13:55:04] <Whirl3d> it will get you there if you can change the resultant html from onclick=......to simply: data-lat=latvlue, data-long=longval
[13:55:07] <w4cko> and after removing things peice by peice i deturmined this was the area it was happening and commented out that line and sure enough
[13:55:09] <Whirl3d> I need to make one change
[13:56:00] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GkHu9/37/
[13:56:22] <Whirl3d> that would indicate a problem with your code, not FF
[13:57:12] <acidjazz> i wanna use the sweetest html5/JS image stuff w/ jquery
[13:57:14] <N3tw0rK> noobiewan: removing the click worked, thanks.
[13:57:18] <z0ned> gotta start somewhere! have the server return a JSON object containing the fields you want to display (number, name, city...lat, lng) then use jquery to parse it and write/attach the html to the dom inside a loop. each time you create a "map" button, attach a click handler to it using .click(function())
[13:57:22] <acidjazz> is there a popular plugin or something i can use
[13:57:31] <acidjazz> (image uploading)
[13:58:15] <N3tw0rK> Whirl3d: is the way your showing the fiddle more "correct" or better designed? I will also be passing the html needed to create a marker with googlemaps and if i need to do this via json then ill redesign
[13:59:13] <Whirl3d> you can do it via json and that's probably preferred. But without going through that hassle, you could use the way I showed you so long as you add the data-long and data-lat attributes to your button code
[14:00:22] <Whirl3d> regardless, the idea is the same. On the result container, listen for "click events by map buttons and when clicked, get the buttons lat/long info and send to the map function
[14:00:30] <w4cko> ya i doubt there is a problem with my code when in only one browser i load the page, check the state of said element and it says disabled=false, then reload the page with and have it say disabled=true before any of my code has even run on it
[14:00:55] <Whirl3d> w4cko, I doubt there's anything wrong with your code too.
[14:01:26] <Whirl3d> it is much more reasonable to assume it's a bug with ff
[14:01:35] <Whirl3d> but now what?
[14:01:45] <Whirl3d> looks like either way, you gotta modify your code, huh?
[14:02:01] <Whirl3d> either that or wait for ff to catch up to your programming skills
[14:02:11] <i386> Hello'
[14:02:12] <Whirl3d> I dunno if I'd wait though, you are pretty far ahead
[14:02:19] <w4cko> i still feel as though i have not got to the bottom of it
[14:02:27] <shoky> w4cko i didn't see any document.getElementById('add_tab').disabled = true;   in your code...
[14:02:46] <toughguyhlve> shoky, how goes it you jquery wizard, you.
[14:02:46] <w4cko> shoky: i was using a function i wrapped it in
[14:02:58] <shoky> w4cko: so?
[14:03:10] <shoky> toughguyhlve am oks. how's you
[14:03:13] <w4cko> i simplified the call by removing jquery from the equation
[14:03:34] <toughguyhlve> ims okay, stuck with a probably really simple problem
[14:04:10] <toughguyhlve> i'm trying to add a class to a specific div if the url contains '/?aspxerrorpath'
[14:04:37] <michelem> hello folks
[14:04:45] <i386> I am looking for a simple example, I have developed a site with jquery and everything is fine. Thus I want to add a javascript function bind to a button <a data-role="button"  . But I do not understand how to bind it to my javascript function
[14:04:45] <toughguyhlve> if(window.location.href.indexOf("?aspxerrorpath"))  wasn't working
[14:05:03] <michelem> can I attach js behavior to elements from js?
[14:05:20] <Whirl3d> i386 lookup api.jquery/bind or .click
[14:05:54] <michelem> thanks
[14:06:02] <bencahill> Hey guys, is there a jquery that can make a file-manager-like interface of selecting objects, and possibly sorting/dragging them? (mainly selecting, though)
[14:06:10] <WhiskerBiscuit> guys, im a raw noob at jquey.  I'm looking for a way to post the same data to two forms at the same time
[14:06:12] <shoky> toughguyhlve:  if(window.location.href.indexOf("?aspxerrorpath") >= 0)
[14:06:12] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, i wrote a little pseudocode for you here: http://jsfiddle.net/GkHu9/38/
[14:06:24] <Whirl3d> bencahill, looup jquery UI
[14:06:27] <z0ned> (the success function)
[14:06:29] <w4cko> shoky, i uploaded the new version just now. line 470 in hive.js is where it happens
[14:06:35] <Whirl3d> they have everything you need, I think.
[14:06:36] <toughguyhlve> shoky, trying now ;p
[14:06:51] <w4cko> if i comment out this line, no problems
[14:07:27] <w4cko> the fix is simple, i enable the button in my JS code. problem solved i guess i just would feel better in knowing more specifically what is happening here
[14:07:32] <Whirl3d> WhiskerBiscuit, exactly the same time...can't happen. Pretty much the same time, piece of cake.
[14:07:53] <WhiskerBiscuit> Whirl3d: pretty much is good enough :)
[14:07:56] <toughguyhlve> shoky, if (window.location.indexOf("?aspxerrorpath=") >= 0) ?
[14:07:58] <toughguyhlve> not working :s
[14:08:06] <toughguyhlve> oh wait
[14:08:06] <bencahill> Whirl3d: Yeah, I think so. I do stuff with JS/JQuery that I forget basics like this. :P
[14:08:10] <toughguyhlve> Just pulled a stupid
[14:08:15] <bencahill> WhiskerBiscuit: Thanks. :)
[14:08:32] <toughguyhlve> got it.
[14:08:34] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: thanks im researching json... all pretty new to me
[14:08:36] <toughguyhlve> Thx shoky :)
[14:08:36] <Whirl3d> WhiskerBiscuit, in your code, capture the submit event for the form and call the submit handler for both forms
[14:08:43] <w4cko> Whirl3d, the last thing i am inclined to think is its a browser bug which is why ive spent hours trying to diagnose this issue
[14:08:51] <toughguyhlve> you are a wizard. and i love it.
[14:08:57] <Whirl3d> me too, w4cko
[14:08:59] <Whirl3d> me too
[14:08:59] <w4cko> but it seems there is no other explanation now that ive narrowed it down to a perfectly fine call
[14:10:31] <z0ned> N3tw0rK, basically what i wrote there should be close for the js side, your server will have to return a json object [{name: "somePlace", city: "hollywood", lat: "32424.234", lng:"14.124", ....}, {name: "somename", .... }, ... ], make sense?
[14:10:59] <WhiskerBiscuit> Whirl3d: when I capture the submit event, do I have to disable something as well?
[14:11:09] <w4cko> i suspect that their is some kind of optimization going on where the element's reference is being cached incorrectly
[14:11:53] <Chirag> AskMP : You there?
[14:11:54] <WhiskerBiscuit> right now, we have a form posting which works fine.  I need to add another post.  So I could just leave the current post alone and then add the jquery part to capture?
[14:12:06] <AskMP> yup
[14:12:18] <Chirag> Can you help me?
[14:12:24] <AskMP> depends what it is
[14:12:36] <AskMP> What’s up?
[14:13:00] <jita> I am unable to intercept click events using on delegation in google maps bubble box
[14:13:05] <jita> how could i do that ?
[14:13:11] <i386> Whirl3d thanks but I have already look around the web. I am looking for is really simple example as I strugle just to set bind a javascript event on a data-role="button"
[14:13:12] <jita> ''on'
[14:13:29] <shoky> w4cko: http://109.123.86.49/bootstrap.html
[14:13:41] <Chirag> M fine. How about you?
[14:13:58] <Whirl3d> $("input[data-role='button']").click(yourFunction);
[14:14:10] <AskMP> Not bad. Did about 800 lines of code today so I’m feel in’ productive.
[14:14:10] <Whirl3d> don't get much simpler
[14:14:12] <shoky> w4cko: its a feature :D  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5985839/bug-with-firefox-disabled-attribute-of-input-not-resetting-when-refreshing
[14:14:30] <Chirag> Oh my my
[14:15:23] <Chirag> Anyway. There's one thing I wanna do.
[14:15:35] <shoky> np toughguyhlve ;]
[14:15:45] <Whirl3d> WhiskerBiscuit, when you capture the submit event for the form, don't return false or preventDefault and it should work fine with the second submission
[14:16:07] <Whirl3d> jita, why can't you intercept the click event on the bubble?
[14:16:17] <Chirag> AskMP:  Imagine a vertical menu of checkboxes in which except one checkbox(of id 'all'), all other checkboxes have vertical submenus of checkboxes. The checkbox of id 'all' should be checked automatically if I check all other checkboxes & it should be unchecked automatically if I uncheck any of the other checkboxes.
[14:17:12] <AskMP> Okay.
[14:17:15] <AskMP> What’s the question?
[14:17:55] <Chirag> How can I do that?
[14:18:31] <Chirag> Should I provide you the code?
[14:19:00] <i386> Whirl3d, i do not figure out my problem /-: would you have a complete html example of it ? <- is this too much ?
[14:19:02] <AskMP> on loading of all of the checkboxes, create a variable of how many there are. On every time a checkbox is clicked, capture the number of checkboxes are checked, if the number matches how many there are, then check the "all", if not, uncheck it.
[14:19:49] <shoky> i386: $('a[data-role='button']').click(yourFunction);
[14:19:51] <bencahill> Does UI Selectable not support shift-selecting? (i.e. click, hold shift and click)]
[14:19:56] <shoky> oops
[14:20:03] <shoky> i386: $('a[data-role=button]').click(yourFunction);
[14:20:35] <Chirag> How? Can you provide the code?
[14:20:47] <AskMP> send me what you have
[14:21:00] <Chirag> Ok. Wait
[14:21:38] <shoky> bencahill: no. you can use ctrl, or you can drag-select with the mouse
[14:21:49] <bencahill> shoky: Ok... :(
[14:22:24] <i386> shoky: still /-: not working - i am so ashame I know it is a basic tool but I still want to use jquery event manager
[14:22:51] <shoky> i386: make a fiddle (www.jsfiddle.net) of your issue
[14:23:27] <bencahill> Hmm, the 'Keyboard selection' section under heading 3 describes exactly what I want. Was not all of this implemented? http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138039/Selectable
[14:23:30] <shoky> i386: are these buttons created after the page is already loaded ?
[14:24:28] <Chirag> AskMP: There  are 8 checkboxes except of id 'all'. Check out the code. http://jsfiddle.net/UjpFQ/2/
[14:25:03] <bencahill> shoky: Ooh, maybe it's in svn: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138039/Selectable
[14:25:06] <i386> shoky: I use the basic of jquery I would not be sure. They are pure html tags, statics, so I suppose they are not created dynamically.
[14:25:07] <bencahill> woops
[14:25:15] <bencahill> shoky: Ooh, maybe it's in svn: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectable/demos/selectable/display-grid.html
[14:25:43] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: ok ive put that code into action but the server is echoing out the json and js isnt parsing it like i believe it should
[14:26:55] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: debug says invalid json
[14:27:25] <WhiskerBiscuit> Whirl3d: thanks!
[14:27:42] <WhiskerBiscuit> i need to beat my devleopers over the head for not investigating jquer
[14:27:42] <shoky> i386: paste your html/code in a pastebin
[14:30:35] <Chirag> AskMP : Got it?
[14:30:40] <AskMP> I did.
[14:30:44] <AskMP> I’m nearly done
[14:30:55] <Chirag> OK
[14:31:06] <Chirag> I shall wait
[14:33:21] <i386> shoky: the goal is to link an event to <a id="R_Gmaps" data-role="button"
[14:33:49] <AskMP> I haven’t tested as the fiddle didn’t work for the HTML however go to version 4
[14:34:21] <i386> shoky: http://pastebin.com/RWdv0q0v
[14:35:48] <Chirag> Version 4?
[14:35:59] <AskMP> In the URL, do you see the 2?
[14:36:05] <AskMP> change that to 4
[14:36:35] <Chirag> Ok
[14:37:47] <Chirag> Let me check. May take a few mins
[14:38:05] <AskMP> please note that there is a variable that is outside of the $(…
[14:38:24] <Chirag> I noted dear
[14:42:37] <i386> shoky: ok done, figure out
[14:49:34] <Chirag> AskMP: Tried that. No luck. If I check any checkbox, checkbox of id 'all' gets checked, which it should not check.
[14:50:27] <AskMP> Open you console and type checkbox_count
[14:50:29] <WhiskerBiscuit> im still not grokking on how to call certain jquery functions.
[14:50:31] <AskMP> what comes up?
[14:50:36] <WhiskerBiscuit> I've added this  $.getJSON("http://jsonip.appspot.com?callback=?", function (data) { alert("Your ip: " + data.ip);});
[14:50:40] <shoky> i386 you figured it out ?
[14:51:10] <WhiskerBiscuit> I'm trying to get the clients ip address into a variable in another jquery function
[14:51:26] <shoky> i386 you need to wrap that stuff with $(document).ready(function() {   ....     });
[14:51:35] <AskMP> WhiskerBiscuit: are you generating the page via PHP?
[14:51:43] <WhiskerBiscuit> no, strictly html
[14:51:46] <shoky> i386: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[14:51:48] <AskMP> damn…
[14:51:56] <bencahill> Can JQuery/JS do something like this? http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/actionscript/create-a-brightness-editor-in-actionscript-3/
[14:52:20] <Chirag> Its giving output 8
[14:52:45] <AskMP> Chirag: sorry, gotta jet. All I can say is that you should be able to compare the count of how many checkboxes there are that are now #all and how many are checked that are not #all. If they match, then check #all
[14:52:46] <silverwind> bencahill, possible with canvas and JS
[14:53:37] <Chirag> OK. NP
[14:54:08] <bencahill> silverwind: Mmkay...not sure if I want to do that though...
[14:55:19] <acidjazz> how do i run javascript when they choose files to upload
[14:55:26] <acidjazz> i tried .change on the upload handler.. nada
[14:56:32] <rroelofs> acidjazz: It's a challenge.  Most of us give up and use flash for that reason.
[14:56:39] <acidjazz> lol flash
[14:56:59] <Nebukadneza> heho
[14:57:03] <rroelofs> you could run a setInterval and read vaue
[14:57:14] <acidjazz> oh u mean a .change doesnt trigger
[14:57:16] <rroelofs> grrr   read the value
[14:57:31] <nFFF> Chirag
[14:57:32] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/x6ZHW/
[14:57:33] <rroelofs> I don't think it does
[14:57:35] <nebmo> hi, at the moment when you submit form (any button) it keeps saying 'Save'. I'm trying to get the button CLASS which was clicked (http://jsfiddle.net/XTCB6/ - line 4 i think)
[14:57:44] <Nebukadneza> i'm trying to use jquery and jquery UI to make tiles (like on http://dyn.kanojo.de:8080/static/index.html?gid=0&uuid=a ) draggable and sortable, however when trying you might notice that sometimes regions of multiple tiles are "skipped" ... and i really can't come to find out what could be going wrong
[14:57:51] <Nebukadneza> would anyone have some kind of hint for me?
[14:57:54] <acidjazz> not a bad idea rroelofs
[14:58:01] <acidjazz> i can initiate it after the click
[15:01:05] <Nebukadneza> hm, noone?
[15:03:43] <acidjazz> ok so now that im watching the file selector and have the event taken care of
[15:03:50] <acidjazz> how do i parse/read/manipulate these files
[15:08:46] <GAEfan> Hi.  I am trying to access the value of a dynamically-set property:  <span class="testt" my_prop="Monthly_amt"></span>
[15:09:40] <GAEfan> I can get to the SPAN, using   this_thingy = $('#div1').children('.class2).find('.testt')
[15:10:27] <GAEfan> but have not been able to retrieve the value of my_prop
[15:11:13] <GAEfan> Or, specifically, the value that is dynamically set in the SPAN
[15:16:37] <dabear> GAEfan: that isn't a property
[15:16:44] <dabear> but rather an attribute
[15:17:01] <dabear> so see ?attr
[15:17:07] <GAEfan> dabear: I have tried attr() prop() text()
[15:17:16] <GAEfan> and many others.
[15:17:19] <dabear> GAEfan: pebkac
[15:17:24] <dabear> ?demo
[15:17:36] <dabear> jsfiddle it :)
[15:22:51] <nebmo> when you submit (any button in the form) it alerts the value of only one of the buttons. I'm trying to get the button CLASS which was clicked (http://jsfiddle.net/XTCB6/ - line 4 i think) how do i do this?
[15:24:06] <GAEfan> dabear: It's a rather complex set of js files to jsfiddle.  I guess my question should be… How do I get the value dynamically inserted into <span class="testy"></span>
[15:24:25] <dabear> GAEfan: using .attr
[15:24:49] <dabear> GAEfan: my guess is that you have selected an element that is not the same as the element you really wanted
[15:24:54] <imachuchu> I want to load up some html into a div, and use a GET, but I need to specify some data with the load (so the .load function then uses a POST which isn't what I want). Whats the easiest compromise/alternative?
[15:25:02] <GAEfan> hmmm…. I will see why it has not worked
[15:27:49] <GAEfan> dabear: attr() returns undefined
[15:28:50] <ignas__> has anyone got a solution to get image data from clipboard at least for the modern browsers?
[15:29:07] <ignas__> I know there's one for chrome
[15:29:49] <ignas__> but what about other browsers
[15:33:02] <shokshok> nebmo: http://jsfiddle.net/XTCB6/1/
[15:34:13] <shokshok> nebmo: what you did,  $('input[type=submit]').click().val(),  <-- selects all submit buttons, triggers a click on them, and gets the value attribute of the first one.
[15:37:16] <shokshok> o he's gone ;S
[15:39:16] <shokshok> GAEfan: how did you set the attribute?
[15:39:22] <jrockjiggz> ?prop
[15:39:22] <caniuse> jrockjiggz: .prop(): Set one or more properties for the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[15:39:51] <jrockjiggz> $('input').prop('type','text');
[15:40:09] <GAEfan> shokshok: the attribute is set dynamically via external js
[15:40:25] <shokshok> GAEfan: i didnt ask if it was external or not..
[15:40:32] <jrockjiggz> yea i just realized lol
[15:40:36] <jrockjiggz> kjdfslkjdsf
[15:45:09] <BryanRuiz1> hi.. im trying to add a  class active in the same postion as the list of divs above it
[15:45:10] <BryanRuiz1> https://gist.github.com/78efa4d2d86649c55091
[15:45:17] <BryanRuiz1> can anyone give me a clue what im doing wrong
[15:54:37] <sanjayb> BryanRuiz1, https://gist.github.com/67afaabde678ad36bb7c
[15:55:03] <BryanRuiz1> thanks sanjayb
[15:55:10] <BryanRuiz1> also items.count is wrong
[15:55:18] <BryanRuiz1> should be items.length
[15:56:22] <sanjayb> BryanRuiz1: right :), of course.
[16:08:00] <acidjazz> ok so i have my listener on my file uploader
[16:08:06] <acidjazz> how do i grab the files
[16:08:17] <acidjazz> like <input type="file" mulitple id="files" />
[16:08:31] <acidjazz> document.getElementById('files').dataTransfer;
[16:24:01] <WhiteWizzard> hello
[16:25:21] <shoky> ohai
[16:27:17] <WhiteWizzard> I have a problem with scaling   $("#great5").hover(function(){ $(this).stop(false,true).effect('scale', {percent:125}, 1000);},function(){ $(this).stop(false,true).effect('scale', {percent:80}, 1000);    $(this).removeAttr('style');   It scales image back smaller than it originally  was
[16:27:18] <imsky> ahoy
[16:27:49] <imsky> would the percent:80 have anything to do with it?
[16:28:03] <WhiteWizzard> no, it should be fine
[16:28:13] <imsky> have you tried percent:100?
[16:28:44] <WhiteWizzard> if you start with 100px image it goes up to 125 and then 80 of 125 is 100
[16:29:04] <imsky> is the resulting image, that's smaller as you say, 80% of the original size?
[16:29:29] <WhiteWizzard> not original size, there is no oringinal size to deal with
[16:29:47] <WhiteWizzard> its about 96% of the original size
[16:30:07] <imsky> does it have any border or padding?
[16:30:09] <WhiteWizzard> when the hover animation stops
[16:30:10] <WhiteWizzard> no
[16:30:27] <WhiteWizzard> <div><img></div>
[16:34:09] <imsky> you should store the original width
[16:41:53] <faryshta> Does anyone know if moodle uses jquery?
[16:43:11] <sunbeam> what is considered the best image slider jquery plugin?
[16:43:17] <sunbeam> (light weight, easy to use)
[16:43:26] <sunbeam> or, which are recommendable ones
[16:52:53] <WebDragon> jquery cycle light, sunbeam
[16:53:03] <WebDragon> quite flexible
[16:53:31] <WebDragon> I even tweaked it to allow for different width images at the chefs menu page at www.charterdejavu.com
[16:54:47] <tw2113> "best" is always subjective
[16:55:11] <sunbeam> WebDragon: thanks
[17:07:53] <jfisk1987> hey guys
[17:08:05] <jfisk1987> im getting an ajax call and id like to refresh the entire site, is this possible?
[17:08:33] <Eviltwin> window.reload();
[17:13:25] <someprimetime> ajpiano: can you tell me how big the waitlist is for jquery con SF?
[17:13:29] <someprimetime> or is there a way to find this out
[17:14:11] <martisj> anybody tried using a scrollto plugin for jquery in firefox ?
[17:14:19] <martisj> doesn't seem to be working here
[17:16:37] <ckoning> Does anyone have a way to get the body of a response after an error code in $.ajax call?
[17:16:50] <ckoning> For example, if I return a 400 - Invalid data
[17:16:58] <ckoning> is there a way to get the body of the response?
[17:21:00] <Eviltwin> ckoning: Access the responseText of the XHR
[17:21:22] <ckoning> Eviltwin: Thanks
[17:25:49] <WebDragon> sunbeam: sorry that was jCarousel not jquery cycle. apologies
[18:10:35] <N3tw0rK> boaz: howdy
[18:13:31] <N3tw0rK> z0ned: you still around?
[18:36:34] <w4cko> when outside of a jquery ui event (not able to access ui.index etc) is tabs('option', 'selected') the usual method to obtain the currently selected tabs index?
[18:36:49] <w4cko> it seems to more often than ide like return -1 when clearly there is a tab selected
[19:22:58] <RealityBall> hello I am having trouble understanding the .add method
[19:23:24] <RealityBall> it doesn't seem to be adding elements to the page I am working on
[19:24:09] <RealityBall> or lets say I want to use the append method like
[19:24:26] <RealityBall> foo.append(bar);
[19:24:29] <ScottG> gotta show us some code
[19:24:43] <RealityBall> how can I capture the appended content
[19:24:45] <RealityBall> in a variable
[19:25:31] <RealityBall> hmmmm I'm going to try a few things before I show some code
[19:25:40] <RealityBall> I think I might know how to fix my problem still
[19:25:46] <RealityBall> gonna take some time for me to test it out
[19:27:24] <MoonSerenity> anyone here ever been on bettercodes.org? Is it a good way to find other developers for projects?
[19:32:02] <RealityBall> haha I kind of have it working but I think I am having problem with .empty now
[19:32:15] <RealityBall> I will read a bit and if I can't figure it out on my own I will try to set up a lint
[19:32:39] <RealityBall> or a fiddle rather
[19:40:25] <RealityBall> okay now I am getting an error
[19:40:34] <RealityBall> and its pointing me to jquery.js itself
[19:40:35] <RealityBall> weird
[19:40:49] <RealityBall> dang it it will take a while to make a good fiddle
[19:42:23] <sonnie> hey, i'm using jquery ui autocomplete, datasource is from a perl script which returns json format [{"label": "hy", "value": "17"}, {...}] according to param. But when i type in the input field, it displays all the result. It seems that the parameter is not sent to the perl script. why?
[20:02:45] <ignaciogiri> hello, how can I change the color of the menu while scrolling? http://tinyurl.com/6uqdjmq
[20:02:56] <ignaciogiri> like this example with parallax: http://www.tokiolab.it/
[20:21:48] <X-Raimo> hello. Why this is not working: for(i=1;i<cnt;i++){         alert(i);         a=$(".nav>li>a:eq(i)").attr('href');         alert(a);     }
[20:22:00] <X-Raimo> alert(i) - works
[20:22:12] <X-Raimo> a=$(".nav>li>a:eq(i)").attr('href'); - undefined
[20:22:36] <X-Raimo> while a=$(".nav>li>a:eq(1)").attr('href');, a=$(".nav>li>a:eq(2)").attr('href'); - works
[20:23:51] <X-Raimo> I have an array with "a" elements. I need JS Array this href values only
[20:27:00] <AskMP> Try $('.nav a').eq(i).attr('href')
[20:28:32] <X-Raimo> that works well
[20:38:22] <X-Raimo> i have selected element in DOM, how do I change its parent value (add class to it)?
[20:41:08] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, are you still having problems?
[20:41:22] <Muthu> .
[20:41:37] <RealityBall> yeah I am now using detach properly but I still can't get it to work properly
[20:41:54] <Whirl3d> What is the problem?
[20:42:10] <RealityBall> I think I need to make a jsfiddle to explain it
[20:42:18] <Whirl3d> ok
[20:42:27] <RealityBall> alright let me get on that
[20:42:42] <Whirl3d> X-Raimo, did you get your questions answered?
[20:44:22] <Whirl3d> ignaciogiri, did you get your problems resolved?
[20:44:34] <ignaciogiri> Whirl3d: no
[20:45:56] <Whirl3d> it appears as though they use an animated fade from one section to the next
[20:48:57] <X-Raimo> Whirl3d: no
[20:49:21] <AskMP> X-Raimo: .addClass('class-name');
[20:50:18] <X-Raimo> Whirl3d: this is not a problem. Problem is how do I access parent element of current element
[20:50:29] <Whirl3d> X-Raimo, .parent();
[20:50:39] <AskMP> Yup
[20:50:50] <AskMP> .parent().addClass();
[20:51:03] <AskMP> Whirl3d: +1
[20:52:18] <Whirl3d> if you have the element selected like var item=document.getElementById("something")....(which is easier to write $("#id")[0], you would wrap the element in a jquery object by adding $() around it like: var item=$(htmlElement); then itemsParent=item.parent();
[20:52:42] <RealityBall> http://jsfiddle.net/ZByZj/1/
[20:52:48] <RealityBall> the fiddle isn't working as intended yet
[20:53:18] <Whirl3d> well, for starters, src is not an attribute of div
[20:53:23] <RealityBall> haha
[20:53:29] <RealityBall> yeah I had to change everything from images
[20:53:33] <RealityBall> to divs
[20:53:36] <RealityBall> to throw it in fiddle
[20:53:43] <RealityBall> lemme change that
[20:54:54] <RealityBall> okay slightly updated
[20:54:57] <RealityBall> http://jsfiddle.net/ZByZj/2/
[20:55:02] <Whirl3d> Try changing this.width to $(this).width();
[20:55:35] <RealityBall> http://jsfiddle.net/ZByZj/3/ updated even more
[20:55:48] <RealityBall> um
[20:55:50] <RealityBall> the width works
[20:56:02] <RealityBall> it does its job correctly
[20:58:31] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, it appears as though you are trying to add images by appending the markup for an image to your DOM.
[20:58:48] <RealityBall> yeah and that part works
[20:58:57] <Whirl3d> what's the problem
[20:59:13] <RealityBall> detach
[20:59:19] <RealityBall> let me see
[20:59:42] <RealityBall> okay so detach works
[20:59:48] <RealityBall> the problem is when I try to reappend
[21:00:00] <RealityBall> you see that the elements are added back
[21:00:04] <RealityBall> after they are detached
[21:00:08] <RealityBall> and they don't come back
[21:00:29] <RealityBall> they should be re-appended because the scrollnumber is set back to 0
[21:01:03] <RealityBall> but they don't re-append
[21:01:45] <Whirl3d> first of all, adding a function called Scroll is not the best idea considering there is already a builtin .scroll   it just gets confusing
[21:01:53] <RealityBall> really?
[21:01:55] <RealityBall> haha
[21:02:27] <RealityBall> okay yeah I didn't know that
[21:02:31] <RealityBall> I can change that
[21:02:39] <Whirl3d> you would probably be best off to use the scrollTo plugin by ariel fleischer for this
[21:03:01] <tw2113> scrollTo mmm
[21:03:12] <Whirl3d> do you have your console open? there are four errors before you can expect anything to work.
[21:03:19] <tw2113> i sometimes see people ask if they should use that one, because it's so "old"
[21:03:40] <Whirl3d> it's old, but it's great. You know of a newer one that works as well?
[21:03:42] <RealityBall> there is nothing in my console not in the jsfiddle
[21:03:45] <tw2113> nope
[21:03:49] <tw2113> i just tell them to use it anyway
[21:03:54] <RealityBall> but on the actual site
[21:03:56] <Whirl3d> Yeah. Good code is timeless
[21:03:58] <RealityBall> there are none
[21:04:20] <RealityBall> I know a plug in that could work but I really want to code this myself
[21:04:51] <tw2113> for the sake of learning RealityBall ?
[21:04:56] <RealityBall> yeah haha
[21:05:00] <tw2113> i can respect that
[21:05:17] <RealityBall> cool man
[21:05:24] <tw2113> if you were avoiding the plugin because it's a plugin, then i'd be scratching my head
[21:05:33] <RealityBall> i just don't know why things aren't being attached again
[21:05:38] <Whirl3d> well, as much as I respect that as well, you need to learn javascript first, then jquery.
[21:05:46] <RealityBall> I know some javascript
[21:05:55] <Whirl3d> not enough to know how to scroll?
[21:06:04] <RealityBall> would it help to see this on a real site?
[21:06:12] <RealityBall> because I can probably do that
[21:06:14] <Whirl3d> not really
[21:06:18] <RealityBall> oh
[21:06:38] <RealityBall> I know how to make it scroll just making it loop forever is driving me crazy
[21:06:47] <Whirl3d> I dont' understand what you are trying to do here. You animation the "left" property of the "scrollBox by 2000 and increment the scroll counter
[21:07:05] <RealityBall> after it scrolls an amount of times
[21:07:13] <RealityBall> it reaches the end of slideshow
[21:07:17] <RealityBall> at the end of the slideshow
[21:07:24] <RealityBall> remove all slides and re-add them
[21:07:47] <Whirl3d> I think you should do it like this:
[21:07:57] <Whirl3d> attach all of your images to the slideBox
[21:08:51] <Whirl3d> make sure it is wrapped in an element that will only show the contents of 1 slide (by setting overflow:hidden and the width=1 slide width
[21:09:13] <ignaciogiri> Whirl3d: I'm back
[21:09:13] <X-Raimo> why this gives false: http://paste.org.ru/?vew97j
[21:09:13] <RealityBall> yeah I got that far
[21:09:23] <Whirl3d> no detach there
[21:09:25] <Whirl3d> no need
[21:10:11] <RealityBall> okay go on
[21:10:11] <Whirl3d> append and detach are expensive in load times. It's best to limit those as much as possible.
[21:10:18] <RealityBall> i meant i got as far as showing one slide
[21:10:46] <Whirl3d> all the slides get attached at the very beginning..inyour case in the markup...no need to script them
[21:11:10] <Whirl3d> then to do a slideshow, just animate the inner slide holder div left:slidewidth
[21:11:16] <Whirl3d> delay, do it again
[21:11:25] <RealityBall> yeah I got as far as that before
[21:11:40] <Whirl3d> well that's about 100 miles from where you are now
[21:11:44] <RealityBall> now you move left through all the slides, now what?
[21:12:01] <Whirl3d> what do you want next?
[21:12:07] <RealityBall> I want them to loop
[21:12:22] <Whirl3d> Then do it like this:
[21:12:23] <RealityBall> thats the big problem here
[21:12:46] <Whirl3d> in your script, take the last element and clone it to add to the very end of your inner contents
[21:13:22] <Whirl3d> when the animation stops, check to see if the last slide is the one loaded. If it is, move the slider contents to the left all the way.
[21:13:49] <Whirl3d> so now the first slide is showing (same as the last slide). It will be imperceptable to the user
[21:15:39] <X-Raimo> why this gives false: http://paste.org.ru/?vew97j
[21:15:45] <RealityBall> to the left all the way?
[21:16:05] <Whirl3d> hold on and I'll fiddle it for you
[21:16:15] <RealityBall> lol k
[21:16:38] <RealityBall> the only part i don't understand is to the left all the way...
[21:17:22] <ignaciogiri> still need this http://tinyurl.com/6uqdjmq, can't make it work that menu
[21:24:03] <krz> i need to generate a random string. is this good enough: Math.random();
[21:26:20] <snover> define random.
[21:26:35] <snover> Math.random is certainly not cryptographically secure
[21:28:37] <sonnie> hey dude. I write source: myprog.pljquery ui autocomplete
[21:29:08] <sonnie> hey dude. I write 'source: myprog.pl' in jquery ui autocomplete . but it seems that the parameter is not sent to myprog.pl
[21:29:37] <sonnie> hey dude. I write 'source: "myprog.pl"' in jquery ui autocomplete . but it seems that the parameter is not sent to myprog.pl
[21:45:30] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: are you still at it?
[21:47:24] <sonnie> hi there. i write 'source: "prog.pl"' in UI.autocomplete. but it seems that ?parameter=value is not sent to script. why?
[21:57:00] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, sorry, I was on the phone and got sidetracked. here is the url. I'll work out comments http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Exrcn/29/
[21:58:21] <w4cko> why does the value returned by tabs('option', 'selected') lagging behind the value that can be returned by $('.ui-tabs-selected').index() to obtain the currently selected tab?
[21:58:42] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: lol you can get pictures on jsfiddle?
[21:58:45] <w4cko> s/the/is/
[21:58:56] <fedora_newb> If you had a list of select elements and one was changed and you wanted to remove the following selects after it, how would that be done?
[21:59:08] <RealityBall> Whirled: oh you are calling them from another website I see
[22:00:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Exrcn/30/
[22:00:40] <bloof> id set it linear easing imo
[22:01:01] <Whirl3d> I commented each line so you could see the logic
[22:03:28] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: wow thanks looks fancy
[22:03:44] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: haha I will look into reverse engineering this thanks a lot
[22:06:51] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Exrcn/34/
[22:07:04] <Whirl3d> This shows you how those functions can be used to make a sliding menu
[22:07:56] <Whirl3d> What's important here is that you see the logic in it. There are better ways to do it, but this does a good job of illustrating the logic behind the process
[22:09:40] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: okay I will look into it and try to understand
[22:09:59] <Whirl3d> it's really easy. Much easier than appending and detaching..
[22:10:31] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: I understand most of it but give me some time I am a bit busy now will look into it in a bit
[22:20:13] <Whirl3d> take your time.
[22:25:53] <fedora_newb> $(this).nextAll(".deal_category").remove(); this removes selects after the called select is called/changed. How can I remove any <br /> that are after each of the .deal_category elements?
[22:27:07] <Cork> $(this).nextAll(".deal_category, .deal_category + br").remove()
[22:27:24] <Whirl3d> $(this).nextAll(".deal_category br").remove() ?
[22:27:37] <Cork> nope that would be br's inside the class
[22:27:41] <Whirl3d> oh. sorry, i didn't see you replied, cork
[22:28:18] <Whirl3d> I guess I misunderstood the question. When you say "after" do you mean after the tag or after the position in the dom
[22:28:47] <Cork> Whirl3d:  <select class="deal_category><br>
[22:28:48] <Whirl3d> yours would select the ones located after the category, mine would remove those after the tag
[22:28:58] <Cork> Whirl3d: no
[22:29:05] <Cork> it would remove them if they where inside it
[22:29:10] <Cork> Whirl3d:  <select class="deal_category><br></select>
[22:29:20] <Cork> Whirl3d: mine did <select class="deal_category></select><br>
[22:29:52] <fedora_newb> Thanks cork, works like a charm. :)
[22:29:54] <Whirl3d> fedora_newb, when you say "after" do you mean inside or after
[22:30:01] <Whirl3d> Cork++;
[22:30:06] <fedora_newb> Whirl3d after
[22:30:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: br isn't valid inside a select element
[22:30:13] <fedora_newb> ^
[22:30:21] <Whirl3d> hmmm.
[22:30:41] <kinesis> Hi, I have a jquery line:             $('#dw_header').css({'height':'100px','width':''});  I want the '' in width to be variable called c_width (var c_width = ...) How do I insert the variable?
[22:30:46] <Whirl3d> ask cork
[22:30:47] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:30:52] <Cork> <_<
[22:31:41] <kinesis> got it nvm
[22:31:45] <kinesis> kinda stupid question
[22:31:45] <Cork> kinesis: your talking about the value or the key name?
[22:31:56] <kinesis> 'width':width});
[22:32:00] <Cork> ah
[22:32:07] <Cork> don't forget the + 'px'
[22:32:21] <Cork> unless width is a string that is
[22:33:18] <Cork> kinesis: alternatively, just .width(width) might be cleaner
[22:45:33] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: in http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Exrcn/30/ what is callb? and what do those || do? and what is $.noop?
[22:47:00] <martisj> || is the same as OR
[22:47:02] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: oh okay just looked it up
[22:47:20] <Cork> ?.noop
[22:47:21] <bot-t> jQuery.noop(): An empty function. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noop/
[23:11:20] <raj> shoky, ping
[23:34:12] <w4cko> how would you refer to a tab easiest by its index?
[23:34:36] <w4cko> like to get its label or url when looping through all tabs
[23:35:54] <w4cko> .each seems like overkill i know there must be a way to just use the index on some part of the object
[23:43:07] <Eshu> how to use .each function on arraylist
[23:43:27] <lmatteis> hey guys
[23:43:34] <lmatteis> i've been using jquery for a while
[23:43:57] <lmatteis> but it just seems like my code just starts getting messier and messier.. like a bunch of $('...').click for elements
[23:44:02] <lmatteis> how do i better organize my code?
[23:44:09] <lmatteis> so that it's easier to manage in the future
[23:50:00] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, we're testing a new server platform and I want to make sure that our site loads every time as we've had some stability issues, can anyone recommend a method to make sure a website loads like every hour, and send an alert if not?
[23:51:47] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: Do a shell script, put in a cron job, that tries to wget the page.
[23:52:27] <Rovanion> fRAiLtY-: And if wget exits with a non-0 value something is wrong
[23:53:28] <Rovanion> Basically this http://www.computing.net/answers/unix/script-to-find-whether-link-is-up/8228.html fRAiLtY- in a cronjob
[23:55:38] <Rovanion> And then send an email trough your favorite scripting language like php
[23:55:56] <Rovanion> I think it has a built in stupid mail sender
