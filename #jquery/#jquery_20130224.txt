[00:32:47] <kapouer> hi
[00:33:53] <hooloovoo> Hello
[00:35:02] <HexSquid> Hello
[00:58:50] <Miki_> hi
[00:58:54] <Miki_> anyone can help me?
[00:59:00] <Miki_> i need people who know english
[01:05:42] <HexSquid> hey
[01:05:48] <HexSquid> I know English
[01:06:58] <j_wright> there is an ##English channel too
[01:07:34] <HexSquid> Are you looking for jQuery help in english?
[01:08:37] <tw2113> actually stating the issue would be a good next step
[01:08:59] <j_wright> a pity ##english isn't about ENGLISH, i could relive my Pick days
[01:13:20] <stemid> http://jsbin.com/ofozuc/1 why would this response generate a fail from .post and say parseerror in the text status argument?
[01:14:19] <stemid> using datatype json of course
[01:34:47] <kapouer> jquery in jsdom issue...
[01:35:38] <kapouer> el.html('<script src="toto.js" type="text/javascript" />') will prepend a script tag in the <head>
[01:36:12] <kapouer> and will globalEval if script has content.
[01:37:17] <kapouer> While that is easy to work around (by simply killing $.ajax and $.globalEval) it is somehow weird that jquery does prepend tag in the head upon insertion of a script tag somewhere else.
[01:55:07] <thinkerweb> i wish ui & mobile theme rollers could correspond

[03:18:30] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/4yFwn/1/

[03:31:35] <thinkerweb> Eviltwin, thx
[03:33:31] <JoeSa> Despite my best efforts, the following form _still_ submits because of the .click method call when a "q" URL parameter (longer than 2 characters) is passed -- how can I stop the form submitting in this case? http://jsfiddle.net/5HVN6/7/
[03:37:58] <JoeSa> For some reason (I think event bubbling or something that I don't fully understand), returning false (or using PreventDefault) for the form submit or submit button click events doesn't work (as demonstrated in the jsfiddle)
[03:40:45] <Eviltwin> Well "No-Library (pure JS)" was the wrong call on the left side there
[03:42:46] <thinkerweb> Eviltwin, I don't know what the heck, I can see the opacity fx locally here
[03:43:17] <JoeSa> My bad, I just copy/pasted my code in my personal files to the jsfiddle
[03:43:24] <JoeSa> The core problem still applies if you enable jQuery
[03:44:31] <Eviltwin> Well you could stop the form from submitting by not submitting it
[03:44:39] <Eviltwin> $("#local_search").click(); is causing it to submit
[03:45:12] <JoeSa> I want to trigger the .click handler, which I've specified in that code, but not submit the form (my click handler returns false which SHOULD stop a submit upon that being clicked)
[03:45:27] <Eviltwin> You've specified it after you trigger the click
[03:45:32] <Eviltwin> Meaning it's not been bound yet
[03:45:36] <Eviltwin> What you want is this: http://jsfiddle.net/5HVN6/9/
[03:46:27] <Eviltwin> Attaching an event handler after the corresponding event is triggered is about as good as never attaching it at all
[03:46:41] <JoeSa> Oh, it's that simple -- that makes sense. Problem: solved -- thanks a lot!
[03:48:54] <Whirl3d> What is the best way to have a short animated image on your website? should I layer a bunch of pngs? use an animated Gif, A mutliple background div. It's a logo animation of about 30 frames.
[03:50:06] <Eviltwin> If it's not directly linked to any interaction on the page then probably GIF will be fastest
[03:51:10] <Whirl3d> Yeah, and if I want it to cycle when some action happens, I could just swap the still image out with the hidden gif for the animation, i suppose. I was just hoping there was a better way. Thanks
[03:52:07] <thinkerweb> Eviltwin, I know its impossible for you to help me with this one, but when I copy my html and jscript to jsfiddle it works but here, on my own computer its not
[03:57:59] <thinkerweb> If I open the demo page of jquery-ui, and navigate to the tabs section, and add {fx : {opacity : "toggle"}} it still doesn't work, meanwhile on jsfiddle it does.  Now when I unzipped it, there were some overwriting
[03:58:31] <Whirl3d> lol
[03:59:34] <thinkerweb> is there something wrong with the jquery files?
[03:59:54] <Whirl3d> definitely file a bug report.
[03:59:55] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:01:05] <thinkerweb> I just checked, its just some png's, it would affect my issue
[04:14:34] <thinkerweb> Eviltwin, please prrof this pg http://bynadeem.info/ui-testing I cant get the opacity fx
[04:16:52] <Whirl3d> thinkerweb, where in the API do you see the fx: property? I didn't see it: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/
[04:17:23] <thinkerweb> Whirl3d, its from a book, but it should be in the api too
[04:18:30] <thinkerweb> Whirl3d, it worked on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/4yFwn/2/
[04:21:10] <thinkerweb> Whirl3d, its for an old version eh?
[04:21:26] <Whirl3d> yeah. 1.01 for jquery UI?
[04:22:11] <Whirl3d> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery-ui
[04:23:22] <Whirl3d> still, it's been deprecated in 1.9, it wants you to use the show and hide options
[04:23:30] <thinkerweb> 1.10, and jsfiddle is still 1.9
[04:23:41] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-fx-option-use-show-and-hide-options
[04:23:55] <thinkerweb> Whirl3d, thx
[04:24:01] <Whirl3d> 1.10 it has been removed
[04:25:42] <Whirl3d> I don't like the way did the version numbers. If they are gonna make 1.10 later than 1.9, it should be 1.10.0 or something. Otherwise it looks like version 1.10, then 1.11, then 1.2, etc.
[04:31:26] <Forrestr> Is there any plugin or tutorial on how to add comma delimited search to a search form?
[04:32:19] <Whirl3d> did you check with the google fairy?
[04:32:52] <Forrestr> Yea hasn't turned up much
[04:33:11] <Forrestr> just info about mysql searching with commas
[04:33:11] <beachandbytes> like multiple search queries query1, query2?
[04:33:20] <Forrestr> Yeah
[04:33:58] <beachandbytes> i guess it would depend on how the search form works
[04:34:11] <Whirl3d> so you want any of the terms or all of the terms
[04:34:24] <Forrestr> Yeah, just looking for a basic example to look at right now.
[04:34:37] <Forrestr> any of them
[04:35:03] <Whirl3d> Just split the text for the search terms into an array and do the searches independently, combining the results
[04:36:03] <HardDisk_WP> Hey
[04:36:04] <Forrestr> Thanks. Wasn't quite sure on how to even begin with this :P
[04:36:20] <Whirl3d> http://tutorialzine.com/2010/09/google-powered-site-search-ajax-jquery/
[04:37:56] <Forrestr> Oh nice, ty
[04:44:56] <beachandbytes> Anyone know how to modify jqueryui combobox/autocomplete to copy over a data attribute into its menu items
[04:45:52] <stabb> you want to preset a value?
[04:47:36] <beachandbytes> I want it to keep the data attribute from the select list
[04:48:01] <beachandbytes> and add it to the ui-menu-item
[04:49:18] <shoky> what select list?
[04:51:10] <beachandbytes> the underlying select list that I apply the autocomplete/combobox to
[04:51:17] <beachandbytes> each option has a data attribute
[04:52:16] <shoky> i don't remember autocomplete being applied to a <select>
[04:53:43] <beachandbytes> nevermind, i don't even need to do this, it appears it passes the original element and not the ul it makes
[04:54:07] <shoky> as you'd expect from a useful library ;P
[04:54:18] <beachandbytes> shoky, you might be right combobox applies to select list
[04:54:28] <shoky> donno what combobox is
[04:55:12] <beachandbytes> it is just a autocomplete with a button that allows you to show all choices
[04:55:32] <beachandbytes> in a drop down list
[04:55:34] <shoky> jqueryui?
[04:55:46] <beachandbytes> its not part of the base package but its demoed on there site
[04:55:52] <beachandbytes> with a few changes for efficency it works great
[04:55:56] <shoky> k
[04:56:43] <stabb> I use it. I find it retarded
[04:57:50] <beachandbytes> what about it, I use it for lists 2000+ and its very fast
[04:58:26] <Jygga> hi, i am using jquery.validate and i am trying to have 3 inputs validate only if all inputs are valid. Can somebody point me in the right direction? namedGroups are wierd?
[04:58:48] <beachandbytes> especially with some efficency enhancements i found on stackoverflow
[05:00:52] <Stilo> anyone use backbone.js here?
[05:20:22] <HardDisk_WP> hey
[05:20:35] <HardDisk_WP> in http://jsfiddle.net/K2HEq/ I'm building a table out of a JSON stuff
[05:20:50] <HardDisk_WP> Any way to simplify 13-26?
[05:20:56] <HardDisk_WP> Can't modify the others
[05:21:13] <HardDisk_WP> But I cant believe this is the best way to create elements...
[05:26:33] <hadifarnoud> I'm trying to change unix timestamp to date here http://jsfiddle.net/NvR5D/1/
[05:26:48] <hadifarnoud> I'm not sure what is wrong with each statement
[05:29:20] <beachandbytes> hadifarnoud http://jsfiddle.net/NvR5D/2/
[05:29:39] <hadifarnoud> thanks beachandbytes
[05:45:00] <dekiss> hi, where can I find reference for jquery functions?
[05:46:48] <sahbeewah> api.jquery.com
[05:47:22] <Stilo> sahbeewah, do you use backbone.js or you already used?
[05:48:04] <Forrestr> Anyone know why mouseleave isn't working with this popover? http://jsfiddle.net/3xeRH/1/
[05:48:33] <sahbeewah> Stilo, no i don't use backbone
[05:48:42] <sahbeewah> ask a question and someone may help
[05:49:54] <sahbeewah> better yet, try #documentcloud
[05:50:10] <Stilo> that channel is dead
[05:50:20] <Stilo> no one is talking, already tried.
[05:52:46] <hadifarnoud> beachandbytes: any idea
[05:52:59] <hadifarnoud> oops sorry. ignore that
[05:54:45] <Stilo> anyway, i'm trying click on a btn (div id="btn") with an image and with backbone.js want to access that button and configure a new view.
[06:01:04] <gnarf> Stilo: they're more likely to know the answer though
[06:01:47] <gnarf> Stilo: it's sunday, and still early for the US... What have you already tried?
[06:02:13] <gnarf> I mean, if you can mock it up in a jsfiddle/show me code/demo i might be able to figure it out
[06:02:20] <Grundell> Hello. Trying to get a responsive table working from this tutorial http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_design_approach_for_complex_multicolumn_data_tables/jquery.com Though it seams like i can't get it to work... went over to put the whole thing in to JS fiddle to see if it would work there... but no result... the fallowing is the JS fiddle, would love if some one could send a glance at it and tell me what i'm doin' wrong :)
[06:02:25] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/BKZYa/1/
[06:07:55] <hadifarnoud> how can change the Date format here? http://jsfiddle.net/NvR5D/4/
[06:08:15] <hadifarnoud> I tried to do it via javascript. didn't work
[06:20:12] <hadifarnoud> how can change the Date format here? http://jsfiddle.net/NvR5D/4/  this is my effort which looks like not working. http://jsfiddle.net/NvR5D/5/
[06:20:29] <Forrestr> what would cause my links to show up as 'site.com/#/tab' using bootstrap tabbable?
[06:20:40] <beachandbytes> hadifarnoud http://jsfiddle.net/NvR5D/6/
[06:21:07] <beachandbytes> once you have it in DateObject just use one of the various format string
[06:21:09] <Forrestr> I mean they show up as 'www.site.com/page.php#/tab'
[06:21:23] <hadifarnoud> beachandbytes: I see. so it wasn't in date object
[06:21:27] <hadifarnoud> beachandbytes: cheers
[06:21:56] <beachandbytes> parse string to number and multiply by 1000 to make unix time compliant with javascript Date Constructor
[06:23:17] <beachandbytes> do you have link Forrestr?
[06:24:04] <Forrestr> working on localhost :/
[06:39:03] <Forrestr> Mmmm thinking it might have something to do with this hashchange.js
[06:51:00] <negev> hi, is there a way to trigger multiple file downloads with jquery?  i.e. say i have five anchor tags each pointing at a download, can i trigger them all at once somehow?
[07:10:19] <Grundell> any one knows an easy way to make a responsive data table ?
[07:25:45] <beachandbytes> Grundell, media queries
[07:25:59] <beachandbytes> then switch column to rows when it gets too narrow
[07:26:28] <Grundell> beachandbytes - yeah of course, i want to toggle what im showing... decided to go with http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_design_approach_for_complex_multicolumn_data_tables/jquery.com
[07:28:24] <beachandbytes> ya, depending on use case, just set minwidth and force them to horizontally scroll
[07:28:24] <beachandbytes> or squish text in fields
[07:28:24] <beachandbytes> no great solution for wide data tables
[07:30:02] <StephenS> hello, I have 10 forms on one page, and I need ajax call to each one of them, how can I do it?
[07:30:23] <StephenS> each form have its unique ID which is in hidden field, but I have trouble generating ajax call for it
[07:30:48] <carpii> why?
[07:31:48] <StephenS> carpii, what why?
[07:31:57] <carpii> why are you having trouble
[07:32:14] <StephenS> Because I don't know how to do it
[07:34:17] <beachandbytes> do you have the code you have tried so far?
[07:35:19] <StephenS> Yes
[07:39:23] <beachandbytes> you want to post it on jsfiddle
[07:40:08] <beachandbytes> $("#submit").click(function() { $.ajax({ data: $("form").serialize(),type:'POST', url: blahblah etc...  });});
[07:40:48] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[07:44:52] <SeySayux> Hi, I need to do a few animations in succession… How do I make jQuery stop until an animation is done? I know there is a callback, but that'd not be an option here -- the animations are rather complex.
[07:45:56] <carpii> why is it not an option?
[07:46:03] <gnarf> anyone going to jQuery.TO ?
[07:47:23] <SeySayux> carpii: foo.animate({ long stuff here}, function() { bar.animate({ long stuff here }, function() { qux.animate({ more stuff }, function() { ...
[07:47:38] <beachandbytes> ya just chain the call backs
[07:48:47] <SeySayux> I'm not going to do… let me check… 35 nested callbacks.
[07:48:59] <SeySayux> For hopefully obvious reasons.
[07:49:19] <esas> SeySayux: Discussed this a few days ago. The only option if you can't use the callsback seems to be to setup an own wrapper which you can register your object/animation to.
[07:49:25] <esas> callbacks*
[07:50:30] <SeySayux> So basically, create a queue, then do everything at once? Hmmkay, might work.
[07:52:03] <esas> You keep a list of "steps" containing object and animation.. when you fire a particular animation, you set the callback for that animation to repeat but with the next item in the list
[07:52:41] <esas> to repeat the method/function*
[07:53:44] <esas> Then you can just start and stop your queue/list after you have registred all objects, and you won't have to deal with timeouts or anything
[07:55:44] <carpii> Sey, also you dont need to pass your callbacks inline. You can define functions to handle each step of your animation, which calls the next step at the end. Then to jQuery you just pass your first function as the callback , avoiding 10 levels of nested hell
[08:22:30] <ravigehlot> Guys, feel free to run this code on your browser: http://pastebin.com/skT838Ph How can I mouse over the eye and make it blink? Sort of changing the background from black to white?
[08:28:49] <ravigehlot> got it
[08:33:01] <nyuszika7h> hi, how can I fix this? XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://minecraft.net/haspaid.jsp?user=test. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[08:34:42] <nyuszika7h> I just want to send a HTTP GET request to retrieve a true/false value
[08:36:13] <Gemclip> I am going through a tutorial. When writting if statements in normal JS i use {} to split up code blocks like when writting a function but in this tutorial they dont use the {} simply breaking each statement into its own line. are the {} required? or optional in IF statements
[08:36:48] <nyuszika7h> Gemclip: can you show an example code?
[08:36:51] <nyuszika7h> I don't really get what you mean
[08:36:57] <Gemclip> yep one sec
[08:39:35] <Gemclip> nyuszika7h: http://jsfiddle.net/z38hz/
[08:39:49] <nyuszika7h> ah
[08:39:56] <nyuszika7h> the {} is optional, but it's a good practice to always use it
[08:40:02] <nyuszika7h> one sec
[08:42:33] <Gemclip> yep seems cleaner to me. I just wasnt sure if that was a quirk of jQuery or not
[08:42:35] <nyuszika7h> Gemclip: http://jsfiddle.net/z5y5M/
[08:42:58] <nyuszika7h> basically, you can leave out curly braces only if you use one and only ONE statement in the if/else
[08:43:46] <fonko> hey guys im having some strange behaviour with my ajax, im sending some info then if the data already exists in my database i response with a number 1.. then i have a switch(response) sentence with case 1: case 2: and default, the weird thing is that it runs all of this! not only the supposed case!
[08:44:09] <fonko> lol i forgot the break; sentence
[08:44:09] <nyuszika7h> fonko: add a break statement at the end of all case blocks.
[08:44:12] <fonko> what a dumb
[08:44:13] <nyuszika7h> yes
[08:44:16] <nyuszika7h> it's not needed after 'default'
[08:44:22] <fonko> thanks :)
[08:44:24] <nyuszika7h> yw
[08:44:36] <Gemclip> so test 6 exicures because the code sees it as AFTER the if statement and just continues normal exicutation to that line
[08:44:46] <nyuszika7h> yes
[08:44:55] <nyuszika7h> indentation doesn't matter in JS
[08:44:58] <Gemclip> got ya.. thanks for the insight
[08:45:05] <nyuszika7h> yw
[08:45:28] <nyuszika7h> ravigehlot: for future reference, you can use http://jsfiddle.net
[09:04:15] <djQuery> yo
[09:14:20] <snollux> Hello! I am loading some elements from other scripts, and want to attach JQuery functions to the stuff inside. However, I obviously can't bind things to them if they aren't loaded yet
[09:14:27] <snollux> so where/when/how do I do this>?
[09:16:45] <snollux> basically, I don't want this class handler to attach UNTIL the four external scripts are fully loaded
[09:16:57] <snollux> I know how to do a callback for just one
[09:17:01] <snollux> but not for four
[09:18:09] <djQuery> ?on@snollux
[09:18:18] <djQuery> damn lazy bots
[09:19:33] <djQuery> snollux, its kinda easy with the on binding    $('.container').on('click', '.btnDelete', function(){ code here});
[09:19:51] <snollux> ok thanks
[09:19:52] <djQuery> `on@snollux
[09:19:53] <snollux> :D
[09:20:01] <snollux> lol bots
[09:20:18] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:21:20] <djQuery> snollux, in the example above container would be a tbody that I am adding rows to after an ajax call. and .btnDelete would be a button in each row
[09:21:34] <snollux> thanks so much!
[09:21:35] <Kambfhase> .on
[09:21:45] <Kambfhase> ?on
[09:22:09] <djQuery> now the container has to exist at the time that the script runs but not the rows or btnDelete themselves
[09:22:50] <djQuery> snollux, read the doc I linked to its quite well doc'd
[09:33:33] <WintermeW> hi guys. to you, what is the best jquery extention for charts and graphs ? ( i need something that is free for commercial use )
[09:36:24] <djQuery> WintermeW, jqplot?
[09:37:22] <djQuery> WintermeW, jqplot is MIT and GPL version 2 licenses
[09:41:50] <beachandbytes> is d3 free for commercial?
[09:43:51] <WintermeW> djQuery: seems cool , i'll give it a shot, thanks
[09:44:01] <djQuery> beachandbytes, https://github.com/novus/nvd3/blob/master/LICENSE.md
[09:52:03] <snollux> So I've got a <ul> list, and inside each LI is a number. How can I make a loop to remove all values under, say, 20? It sounded simple at first, until I realized that the stuff inside the LI is not seen by jquery as a value, but as a string
[09:52:48] <carpii> parseInt, but you might like to ignore the text and set a data-number="6" on the actual li
[09:53:04] <carpii> then you can just access li.data("number")
[09:57:59] <level9> hey buys: Anybody an Idea? I have a sortable list. one parameter of this sortable is the callback function "receive" ... how can I get the received element in tehre
[09:58:00] <level9> ?
[09:58:27] <level9> a reference to the received element
[09:59:18] <level9> question answered thanks
[09:59:55] <snollux> carpii: Ok, I added an attr called "data-number". So how can I loop through this and remove values > or < than whatever?
[10:00:32] <beachandbytes> level9 this?
[10:00:36] <beachandbytes> $(this)
[10:01:05] <level9> beachandbytes: No. $(this) will give me the reference to the receiving container
[10:01:15] <beachandbytes> I would hace to see the code level8
[10:01:18] <carpii> off the top of my head, something like.. $("ul#mylist li").each(function() { if ($(this).data("number") >= 5) $(this).remove() });
[10:01:19] <beachandbytes> can you post it on jsfiddle
[10:01:21] <beachandbytes> level9
[10:03:04] <level9> beachandbytes: thanks I found it out myself
[10:03:08] <level9> thansk
[10:03:17] <beachandbytes> np
[10:03:29] <beachandbytes> what was it?
[10:04:07] <level9> beachandbytes: instead of receive i should use update -> the callback has to parameters -> ui.item will get me the right item then
[10:05:54] <level9> normally its not necessary but if you clone the item you get the reference of to element which was cloned :D so the old one
[10:06:09] <snollux> I don't think I'm doing the EACH right: http://pastebin.com/mEQHNm9j at least, it doesn't have much of an effect
[10:06:15] <snollux> can someone look at my syntax?
[10:07:01] <Kambfhase> snollux: whats li.dataNumber?
[10:07:07] <beachandbytes> li.dataNumber this and the fact that you don't have # or . on your selector
[10:07:10] <snollux> dataNumber is an attr
[10:07:11] <beachandbytes> is probably your problem
[10:07:24] <beachandbytes> li.data("Number");
[10:07:24] <Kambfhase> use $(li).attr('dataNumber')
[10:07:47] <beachandbytes> if your using data its probably a data attribute
[10:07:54] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah
[10:09:48] <snollux> http://pastebin.com/8K4jzX1G here's what I've got now, still not working :)
[10:09:53] <HarryPitfall> i found a strange way to break jquery
[10:10:20] <HarryPitfall> I've added Object.prototype.eachOwn = function() ... to my website script
[10:10:24] <HarryPitfall> bingo
[10:10:29] <beachandbytes> snollux try .data("Number")
[10:10:43] <beachandbytes> also I don't see val being defined
[10:10:52] <HarryPitfall> add anything to Object.prototype breaks jQuery...
[10:11:06] <djQuery> snollux, what is the complete html of the li itself it should be something like <li  data-number="4">
[10:11:32] <djQuery> snollux, then you can access it like beachandbytes  said
[10:11:36] <carpii> snollux, why ask me for example code then just ignore it?
[10:11:42] <beachandbytes> it breaks javascript HarryPitfall
[10:11:52] <HarryPitfall> serious?
[10:12:05] <HarryPitfall> is very normal to me add things to prototypes
[10:12:10] <HarryPitfall> String, Array, Number
[10:12:20] <beachandbytes> ya but javascript uses an object hashtable
[10:12:28] <beachandbytes> by adding to the prototype of object
[10:12:29] <beachandbytes> you break it
[10:12:30] <Kambfhase> only do that if you use ES5
[10:12:49] <beachandbytes> there are definitly ways around this
[10:12:51] <beachandbytes> but iv
[10:12:56] <beachandbytes> e never needed them
[10:14:26] <snollux> djQuery: ok, it now looks like this for the HTML: <li data-number="18.00">18.00</li>
[10:14:42] <beachandbytes> HarryPitfall -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1827458/prototyping-object-in-javascript-breaks-jquery
[10:15:16] <djQuery> beachandbytes, sounds like you ran into this before
[10:16:04] <beachandbytes> once you learn prototype you want to mess with everything
[10:16:28] <beachandbytes> object is the perfect place to mess with everything in DRY way
[10:17:03] <snollux> http://pastebin.com/fqxgy0Pp heeere's something weird; the code only goes once -- it seems to break at that if statement
[10:17:39] <snollux> TypeError: li.data is not a function @
[10:18:02] <beachandbytes> snollux what error are you getting?
[10:18:40] <snollux> saying that li.data("Number") is bad, I guess
[10:19:58] <snollux> once again, here's the HTML <li data-number="13.80">13.80</li>
[10:20:01] <djQuery> snollux, most likely that li is not a jquery object
[10:20:16] <djQuery> snollux, get rid of the dang alert and use console.log
[10:20:26] <snollux> so I am doing the for each loop wrong?
[10:20:42] <djQuery> snollux, console.log(li.jQuery);
[10:21:14] <djQuery> snollux, put it in a jsbin.com or a jsfiddle.net with the html and the script
[10:26:04] <motaka2> Hello
[10:26:11] <motaka2> Should I use jquery UI ?
[10:26:22] <motaka2> Is there any downside?
[10:26:41] <snollux> got it workin
[10:26:43] <snollux> yay
[10:27:02] <Kambfhase> motaka2: the down side is the additional download.
[10:29:13] <djQuery> Kambfhase, motaka2, which can be lessened by using a CDN
[10:29:36] <Kambfhase> yeah
[10:31:41] <djQuery> what do you do to work around reserved names like delete?
[10:31:52] <snollux> if I know an LI's class, how do I select everything else with the same class
[10:32:02] <snollux> like, $(this.class)?
[10:32:04] <snollux> or what
[10:32:15] <basiclaser> hey guys, any good resources on creating a mobile app from start to finish? All i can find is those automated widget things D:
[10:33:21] <shoky> snollux: $('.' + className)
[10:33:22] <beachandbytes> an html app?
[10:33:40] <beachandbytes> i think he means to resolve the class dynamically from the li
[10:33:42] <snollux> how do I get the class name?
[10:33:43] <snollux> yeah
[10:33:48] <snollux> exactly
[10:33:49] <shoky> he said he knows it
[10:33:54] <basiclaser> beachandbytes: yep just html5cssjquery from start to finish for mobile devices
[10:33:55] <shoky> he lied :(
[10:34:16] <shoky> snollux: an element can have many classes. there is no 'the class'
[10:34:22] <djQuery> snollux, $(li).class()
[10:34:26] <beachandbytes> snollux use $(this).attr('class')
[10:34:29] <shoky> whut
[10:34:36] <beachandbytes> then each over the list
[10:34:52] <beachandbytes> and select the items
[10:35:31] <motaka2> Kambfhase: So I should use it or not ?
[10:35:31] <beachandbytes> altho there is probably a better way to do what you want, since I have never had to do this
[10:35:47] <Kambfhase> motaka2: thats not something I can decide
[10:36:19] <motaka2> Kambfhase: I can develope mine , as I developped my own framework
[10:37:19] <beachandbytes> basiclaser probably the best way to learn is build something simple like a twitter app
[10:37:24] <beachandbytes> and use various tutorials
[10:37:32] <beachandbytes> or strugle through it
[10:37:52] <beachandbytes> I doubt there is a full pure html5jquery tutorial that does not have server side
[10:38:13] <basiclaser> trudat
[10:38:25] <beachandbytes> what is your server side language of choice
[10:38:28] <beachandbytes> i would start there
[10:38:36] <basiclaser> no idea
[10:38:42] <basiclaser> only ever used htmlcssjquery
[10:38:51] <beachandbytes> windows/linux/mac?
[10:39:16] <basiclaser> mac
[10:39:53] <basiclaser> oh wait server OS?
[10:39:58] <beachandbytes> dev os
[10:40:01] <basiclaser> linux i guess
[10:40:08] <basiclaser> oh I'm working on my mac
[10:40:27] <beachandbytes> okay, look for some django or rails mobile jquery app tutorials
[10:40:47] <beachandbytes> you will find more full tutorials searching for the server side component
[10:41:30] <beachandbytes> maybe try looking for a simple twitter app tutorial
[10:41:37] <basiclaser> i just started learning jquery, So maybe i could just focus on finishing the sealed html5 package first? the site is only one page and uses two hardware apis
[10:41:41] <basiclaser> ok thanks
[10:41:43] <beachandbytes> that is pretty commmon for beginner mobile tutorials
[10:42:05] <beachandbytes> website that uses hardware api?
[10:42:12] <beachandbytes> which api
[10:42:30] <basiclaser> vibrate and beep
[10:42:57] <basiclaser> or audio rather
[10:42:59] <beachandbytes> phonegap?
[10:48:10] <jj234> is it possible to create a loop which continuously looks for AJAX replies (I want to update a status bar) without locking up the web app in a simple while loop?
[10:48:29] <jj234> I essentially want a thread for receiving AJAX replies so I can update a progress bar
[10:49:28] <level9> whats the html code for an escaped plank ? (off topic)
[10:49:45] <djQuery> jj234, http://techoctave.com/c7/posts/60-simple-long-polling-example-with-javascript-and-jquery
[10:51:37] <jj234> not polling would be ideal if it's possible
[10:51:53] <beachandbytes> websockets
[10:52:04] <jj234> I was hoping for perhaps a function you can call which won't freeze up the JS engine and just handles replies
[10:52:05] <beachandbytes> but I would use a library instead of doing this yourself
[10:52:17] <beachandbytes> so you get websockets if available and fallback to long polling
[10:52:46] <beachandbytes> if you use long polling it won't freeze up js engine
[10:53:02] <level9> I used Ratchet  (PHP Websocket) recently ... rlly nice
[10:53:46] <djQuery> jj234, the article I linked to covered polling, long polling and web sockets
[10:54:28] <jj234> thanks, I"m checking it out now
[10:55:01] <beachandbytes> signalR has been best signaling library i have used
[10:55:10] <beachandbytes> altho Ratchet is also very good
[10:55:30] <beachandbytes> (differnt server side languages)
[11:05:25] <linusoleander> Has anyone in here used typeahead.js before?
[11:05:26] <linusoleander> I've been trying to implement it in one of my apps for 3h now, nothing happens when I type stuff
[11:08:09] <djQuery> linusoleander, errors? example? demo?
[11:08:36] <djQuery> linusoleander, or where you looking for the psychic option
[11:09:03] <linusoleander> djQuery: Here is the code used: https://gist.github.com/oleander/0ab0954411339e3b5d60
[11:09:33] <linusoleander> djQuery: I can search for "timtrueman" but not "PostgreSQL"
[11:10:43] <djQuery> linusoleander, so your trying to give it 2 locals?
[11:10:56] <basiclaser> hey guys i found a jquery mobile app tutorial from may 2011, should i find a more recent one, or will it be ok?
[11:11:29] <linusoleander> djQuery: I've tried to remove the local key, but the problem remains
[11:18:15] <Gemclip> in this snip what does the ? do? does it act as an if else statement?     check($input) ? success.call($input.get(0)) : failure.call($input.get(0));
[11:18:50] <carpii> in short, yes
[11:18:55] <carpii> an if else
[11:19:43] <carpii> if (check($input)) {  success.call($input.get(0))} else {failure.call($input.get(0))};
[11:20:06] <Gemclip> ok just shorthand then
[11:20:45] <Gemclip> one other question on the end of a function i am lookig at they have (jquery); by itself what does that do?
[11:26:03] <djQuery> Gemclip, typicaly this is like so (function($){}(jQuery))   it immediatley executes the function passing in jquery as a parameter to it
[11:26:44] <djQuery> Gemclip, typicaly they use jQuery instead of $ here incase the $ has been used by some other library
[11:28:10] <sanguisdex> what really stupid noobish thing am I missing here "function ($) { $(".form-select").chosen();  })(jQuery);" returns a syntax error about neefing a function name
[11:28:39] <Clex> sanguisdex: well, the name is missing.
[11:28:45] <Clex> "function name($)" for example.
[11:29:56] <Clex> Oh no, sorry.
[11:30:15] <Clex> (function ($) { $(".form-select").chosen();  })(jQuery) maybe?
[11:32:18] * sanguisdex is trying it
[11:33:55] <Gemclip> very close. the structure you list is compairable. what is that jquery call for?
[11:34:14] <sanguisdex> Gemclip: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[11:34:31] <sanguisdex> if you have not seen it. your welcome
[11:35:14] <djQuery> sanguisdex, like the multiple
[11:35:30] <basiclaser> djQuery: is a tutorial for jquery mobile from mid 2011 worth doing or should I find a newer one?
[11:35:49] <sanguisdex> djQuery: yeah, my boss hates fretagging but loves auto complete
[11:35:56] <sanguisdex> this is a fantasic medium
[11:36:06] <Gemclip> sanguisdex: not sure how that applies to my question. nice plugin though
[11:36:47] <sanguisdex> glemclip oh sorry than I don't know at all what you asking
[11:36:51] <djQuery> sanguisdex, select doesn't natively support place holder does it?
[11:37:53] <Gemclip> Clex. Thats the format I was asking about. What does the (jquery); do in that code
[11:37:54] <sanguisdex> djQuery: it's the <option value="place-holder">
[11:38:22] <Clex> Gemclip: you're calling the function you just declared. "jQuery" is an argument, like func(jQuery).
[11:38:36] <sanguisdex> Clex: it works but it can't find the chosen function but that s  whole other day
[11:38:42] <djQuery> sanguisdex, your doc has <select data-placeholder="Choose a country..."
[11:38:56] <Gemclip> ahh imesiate call. got ya
[11:38:58] <sanguisdex> s/day/issue/
[11:39:03] <djQuery> just noticed you were using data-placeholder not placeholder
[11:39:19] <sanguisdex> djQuery: ohhh
[11:39:23] <Clex> sanguisdex: have you included the file correctly?
[11:39:30] <sanguisdex> Clex: yes
[11:39:56] <sanguisdex> djQuery: no you just include a value less option as a place holder
[11:40:56] <sanguisdex> hey guys I do js once every six months so I am getinng all my terminoligy wrong thanks for putting up with me
[11:41:26] <djQuery> sanguisdex, I typicaly do it this way http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805059/select-placeholder/5859221#5859221
[11:45:49] <djQuery> dang I hate refactoring code
[11:49:09] <sanguisdex> djQuery: http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/post/43140061087/automatic-refactoring
[11:49:42] <domino14> i don't understand when "this" gets bound to functions
[11:50:28] <domino14> i have a $.post(url, data, successFunction) -- inside successFunction, "this" seems to be the jqxhr i think
[11:51:57] <djQuery> domino14, each time you create a new function you get a new this.
[11:52:19] <djQuery> domino14, if they are nested this refers to the this in the scope of the curent function
[11:52:31] <domino14> does the $.post create a new function?
[11:52:54] <djQuery> domino14, create\call a function
[11:53:02] <djQuery> $.post is a function
[11:53:26] <djQuery> $.post(data, function(r){ }
[11:53:45] <djQuery> srry I don;t know how to explain it
[11:53:52] <djQuery> still a little foggy from being sick
[12:07:11] <V8Energy> $("#element").hover(function() { alert("ENTERING" }, function() { alert("LEAVING"); }); any ideas why it keeps on alerting ENTERING, LEAVING, ENTERING, LEAVING etc... while i am moving my mouse inside the #element?
[12:07:24] <V8Energy> I never hover outside of the #element
[12:07:36] <carpii> is there a child element which is stealing the mouse focus ?
[12:07:52] <djQuery> V8Energy, maybe because the alert is removeing focus from the element
[12:07:53] <V8Energy> that's possible.
[12:08:00] <V8Energy> changing the z-index should fix the problem?
[12:09:42] <V8Energy> djQuery: i'd like it to remain in "hover mode" while the mouse is hoved over the child though
[12:10:51] <Kambfhase> V8Energy: alert is not a debugger
[12:11:00] <V8Energy> console.log is?
[12:11:25] <djQuery> V8Energy, well at least console.log doesn't interupt the current flow
[12:11:37] <V8Energy> true
[12:11:43] <djQuery> V8Energy, http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:31:51] <mboro> is there any lib out there that does swipe/drag/touch/pinch/wheel abtractions?
[12:38:13] <darcyclarke> mboro http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/
[12:38:56] <mboro> cool, no wheel/mspointer support tho
[12:39:33] <darcyclarke> close enough
[12:45:02] <djQuery> anyone else having an issue with toolbar footer in jqmobile covering up the last of the content
[12:45:42] <djQuery> it can be seen in this example http://api.jquerymobile.com/fixedtoolbar/
[12:46:21] <djQuery> look at the Fullscreen fixed header example notice how even when scrolled to the bottom of the example some of the text is covered up
[12:47:13] <Kambfhase> djQuery: did you read the text that is covered up?
[12:48:04] <shoky> if you click the container, the footer slides away
[12:48:26] <djQuery> shoky, well.... I have that disable in my app lol
[12:48:31] <shoky> ;p
[12:49:18] <level9> question if i have a div which the id="foo" and this div is containing a div and in the div there is an input field. Why can't I access it by $("#foo").children("div > input") ?
[12:49:31] <djQuery> shoky, gues I will just have to add <h3>&nbsp;</h3> to the bottom of my pages
[12:49:46] <shoky> level9: .children() only finds direct children. the input is not a direct child of #foo
[12:50:28] <shoky> djQuery: or maybe some css :after thingy with the right height ?
[12:50:30] <djQuery> level9, think u want .find
[12:50:55] <djQuery> shoky, margin-bottom: couplepx
[12:50:56] <level9> djQuery: -> $("#foo").find("div > input") ?
[12:51:09] <djQuery> level9, give a shot
[12:51:25] <shoky> djQuery: er that could work too
[12:51:45] <level9> djQuery: i think its not working
[12:52:16] <djQuery> level9, demo? jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[12:52:18] <shoky> is the input a direct child of the div? more importantly, jsfiddle it
[12:52:51] <djQuery> damn lazy bots

[13:06:16] <jDork> Hello, i'm stuck on this - i'm sure i missed something easy, but the items are always returned as undefined. http://pastebin.com/Xp9g8XA0
[13:08:49] <jDork> Anyone awake? :)
[13:12:26] <djQuery> how do you determine which submit button was clicked if a form has more than 1?
[13:13:35] <jDork> djQuery: A form can only have one.
[13:15:41] <djQuery> jDork, ques I will just bind to the click event of the submit input types and set a data attribute on the form then check the data attribute in the submit handler
[13:16:50] <jDork> jQuery or submit using ajax
[13:17:03] <jDork> djQuery: or submit using ajax
[13:17:19] <djQuery> jDork, the app is completly client side
[13:18:01] <jDork> djQuery: Oh
[13:32:05] <veQue> =/ i know there's a better way to go about my most desired solution but i may need help.. say i have some ids stonePercentage stoneMoney rockPercentage rockMoney
[13:32:38] <veQue> i am trying to figure out a selector ...
[13:33:19] <veQue> that would effectively manipulate stoneMoney when i manipulate stonePercentage
[13:33:32] <veQue> and vise versa
[13:34:34] <veQue> i am just testing the waters her because i know i can put wrappers around (stonePercentage stoneMoney) and (stonePercentage stoneMoney)
[13:34:57] <veQue> but i dont want to wrap all of my markup code if possible
[13:35:15] <veQue> is there an alternate way?
[13:38:32] <veQue> hmm i think i'm on to something
[13:40:52] <veQue> even if i can tell the selector to see if the first 3 characters of an id is equal to this's value
[13:41:06] <veQue> this's first three chars
[13:41:33] <nyuszika7h> hi, is it possible to get a true/false value from a remote server using JSONP?
[13:41:38] <nyuszika7h> it gives a parse error
[13:42:12] <mush> does anyone know how i could store a name inside a div as a variable? i am trying to make this list of user profiles extend with more info when clicked
[13:42:38] <nyuszika7h> mush: are you using HTML5?
[13:42:43] <nyuszika7h> if so, you could set a data-foo attribute
[13:43:01] <mush> yup
[13:43:14] <basiclaser> silly question: If you share you project files on github, can everyone see them?
[13:43:26] <mush> yeah..
[13:43:27] <nyuszika7h> you can also use jQuery.data
[13:43:40] <nyuszika7h> basiclaser: yes, unless you pay for a private repo
[13:43:52] <mush> cool will look into jQuery.data
[13:44:03] <basiclaser> ah ok so its not the place for stuff you want to sell or people can just copy? whats the behaviour like?
[13:44:06] <obert> pay for private repo?
[13:44:15] <basiclaser> ok thanks
[13:44:25] <LocalPCGuy> you need to pay for a private repo or look at using bitbucket
[13:44:26] <HarryPitfall> data- attributes and jQuery.data really helps
[13:45:35] <nyuszika7h> obert, basiclaser: https://github.com/plans
[13:46:07] <mush> would i use data- and jQuery data in combination with each other? if you guys know any tutorials on this stuff please let me know :)
[13:46:07] <basiclaser>  o i c  :c
[13:46:12] <obert> indeed. bitbucker got private repo for free seems
[13:46:29] <nyuszika7h> mush: you can use $(selector).data(foo) to retrieve HTML5 data- attributes
[13:46:39] <nyuszika7h> I'm not sure does it set them when you use .data(foo, bar)
[13:46:43] <LocalPCGuy> yah, bitbucket is "pay if you have a team bigger than X (5 I think?)" where Github is "pay if you want private"
[13:47:06] <mush> nyuszika7h: super, thx
[13:47:09] <nyuszika7h> yw
[13:47:45] <obert> better use bitbucker in my case then ;)
[13:55:37] <obert> sorry, someone knows what is this? http://www.google.com/tagmanager/

[14:03:54] <veQue> \o/ woo hoo it works
[14:04:15] <veQue> genius this juery language is so genius
[14:04:23] * veQue does dance
[14:04:47] <veQue> $('.classname[id^="'+firstThree+'"]').val('');
[14:05:03] <veQue> and before that var firstThree = $(this).attr("id").substr(0, 3);
[14:05:09] <veQue> works like a charm
[14:06:08] <veQue> i guess coders are lazy because if i just copy and pasted like 17 more times and tweaked each word i probably would have been done
[14:07:18] <veQue> i feel like such a genius i'm taking 10
[14:07:48] <evilaim> So, jquery is good for anything from what I've heard.
[14:07:58] <evilaim> Is there any scripts that make your site act like an ssh terminal?
[14:07:58] <shoky> nyuszika7h:  i think it should be possible to get a true/false value with JSONP
[14:07:59] <StephenS> one q with ajax
[14:08:13] <evilaim> So you can do 'register' and it'll ask for the pertinant info like you did an adduser?
[14:08:27] <evilaim> stuff like that?
[14:08:37] <evilaim> or is that gunna be pointing me towards some horrible flash deal?
[14:09:20] <shoky> nyuszika7h: though that's not JSON per se
[14:09:36] <nyuszika7h> evilaim: I don't think that's possible with JavaScript. you're better off using a Flash or Java SSH client with a script running as a special user account
[14:09:38] <shoky> actually its never json, nvm
[14:09:43] <StephenS> I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/JYnbD/ but it does not work
[14:09:51] <StephenS> Actually works only for one, somehow, but not for others in loop
[14:10:01] <evilaim> Yea, I can't allow it to actually be an ssh..
[14:10:12] <evilaim> So I'd have to use some flash dealio to emulate ssh.
[14:10:40] <Krambfhase> StephenS: you cannot have multiple elements with the same ID on a page
[14:10:51] <Krambfhase> .ID
[14:10:53] <StephenS> Krambfhase,
[14:10:54] <StephenS> ok
[14:11:03] <StephenS> but how would I generate ids for ajax
[14:11:22] <StephenS> here http://jsfiddle.net/JYnbD/1/ kraft
[14:11:25] <StephenS> Krambfhase,
[14:11:31] <djQuery> StephenS, you do know you are only allowed 1 element per ID right?
[14:11:39] <StephenS> Yes I do
[14:11:49] <StephenS> but I don't know which ID to register with ajax, can you see http://jsfiddle.net/JYnbD/1/
[14:11:57] <Krambfhase> $('form')
[14:11:58] <djQuery> StephenS, the ids do not get posted in an ajax
[14:12:07] <Krambfhase> why dont you just select all form?
[14:12:34] <StephenS> hmm will form work?
[14:12:57] <djQuery> StephenS, in fact the ids do not get posted in any type of submit
[14:13:10] <djQuery> just thier names wich are not required to be unique
[14:13:11] <StephenS> so why do I even need ids?
[14:13:26] <StephenS> tis $('form') will work without ids
[14:13:35] <sunbeam> hi, i would like to give a each top level ul > li a class ("has-submenu") if the top level li contains a ul.submenu
[14:13:41] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[14:14:19] <obert> carpii: pff
[14:15:01] <Krambfhase> $('ul ul.submenu').addClass('has-submenu')
[14:15:24] <StephenS> I don't understand, now I make an id for that while() loop which is static for every form, but it does not work
[14:15:47] <wroathe> $('ul:first > li).addClass(function (index, currentClass) { if($(this).find('.sub-menu').length > 0) { return 'has-submneu'; } });
[14:15:54] <djQuery> sunbeam, $('#topul li').each(function(){  var $this = $(this); if ($this.children('ul').length){$this.addClass('has-submenu'); }})
[14:15:57] <StephenS> How to close only that form?
[14:16:01] <obert> brrr
[14:16:46] <sunbeam> djQuery: thanks, you mean  if ($this.children('ul.submenu') right?
[14:17:08] <djQuery> sunbeam, sure
[14:17:44] <djQuery> sunbeam, before you go to far outa your way have you looked at ui.menu?
[14:17:58] <djQuery> .ui.menu@sunbeam
[14:18:10] <StephenS> here, this one on submit close all forms http://jsfiddle.net/JYnbD/2/
[14:18:13] <StephenS> What I'm doing wrong?
[14:19:48] <djQuery> StephenS, I don't think serialize is going to serialize items that do not have a name
[14:19:50] <sunbeam> djQuery: dont understand?
[14:20:31] <djQuery> sunbeam, http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[14:20:33] <veQue> anyone besides me find the youtube search on people's pages sucky?
[14:21:19] <veQue> i'm at this guys syoutube page and type "ajax" and get one video  and it's not even the video i just watched which has ajax in the title
[14:23:48] <StephenS> djQuery, can you update my example and show me?
[14:24:05] <StephenS> I dont need serialization, I need only each form to be unique, with unique ID, which I already have, and now I need jquery to select ids
[14:24:05] <djQuery> StephenS, probably not
[14:24:47] <djQuery> if you didn't understand the comment that input's need to have names for serialize to serialize them then I don't know how editing it is going to help
[14:25:36] <djQuery> why not try explaining what your goal is instead of what you are having an issue wiht
[14:25:49] <djQuery> it may be that you are barking up the wrong tree anyway
[14:28:11] <StephenS> hmm
[14:29:08] <StephenS> My goal is to submit a form (where I have multiple forms as in example) and then to submitted form transfer via ajax to test.php check session id and check if txt_id is the same as user_id in db, and then to process it, and after that to .hide submitted form, but to all other forms remain for new submission with ajax and so on..
[14:29:13] <StephenS> Its basically on while() loop forms..
[14:30:19] <djQuery> <form data-dbID="34">
[14:30:40] <djQuery> so you need the row id basicaly that coresponds to the form?
[14:31:07] <djQuery> $(this).data('dbID')
[14:32:29] <snover> there is no case in html
[14:38:54] <adamsilver> i have a hidden div, how can i show it using jquery colorbox when a certain condition is met in my js code?
[14:41:04] <fonko> can i use a "value" att in a "a" html tag?
[14:41:43] <fonko> because im trying to send a value from a dropdown menu with twitter bootstrap and i just find out im showing <a> tags inside it :S
[14:41:49] <Krambfhase> yes, but that will leak memory in old versions of IE
[14:42:00] <djQuery> fonko, can you yes , should you NO   html5 spec provices the new data attributes for this
[14:42:19] <djQuery> <a href="whatver" data-value="test">
[14:42:19] <Krambfhase> and it will not behave like an input element
[14:42:59] <fonko> thanks djQuery
[14:43:40] <fonko> so to call this a through jquery...
[14:44:06] <fonko> should it be something like var something= $("#id").val(); ?
[14:44:27] <StephenS> djQuery, hmm I guess something like that
[14:44:41] <StephenS> but I cannot figure out how to ajax listen only for that specific form
[14:45:03] <StephenS> because what if I have in while loop 10 forms, and one form for contact outside of loop which dont use ajax?
[14:45:11] <StephenS> It will still make ajax request
[14:45:54] <djQuery> fonko, to get the value it would be $('#id').data('value')  to set it $('#id').data('value', 'whatver');
[14:46:10] <fonko> ok thanks sr!
[14:52:24] <StephenS> djQuery, any idea?
[15:01:44] <ThrushAAX> whoah, I just pulled 1.9.1 and I get a syntax error when doing $('   <div></div>')
[15:03:09] <ThrushAAX> check the console here... http://jsfiddle.net/67E2B/
[15:03:51] <carpii> remove the leading spaces
[15:04:16] <ThrushAAX> so now I need to do $($.trim(some html))
[15:04:24] <ThrushAAX> it used to be ok with leading spaces
[15:04:31] <carpii> yeah im not sure why its not working exactly
[15:04:40] <carpii> its not just spaces, even if you prepend with &nbsp;
[15:04:58] <carpii> i guess it has to be a complete node
[15:05:18] <ThrushAAX> steeping through the source code its looking for [0] === '<' :(
[15:05:47] <carpii> ew
[15:06:14] <carpii> probably for performance reasons, but doesnt seem an awesome idea
[15:06:41] <carpii> but you could always wrap your own div around it which ensures it works
[15:07:02] <ThrushAAX> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L91
[15:12:00] <Forrestr> Can anyone please tell me why these bootstrap tabs won't work and why the content is positioned the way it is? http://jsfiddle.net/AU8RB/1/embedded/result/
[16:06:33] <capsz_> @alta
[16:17:07] <HardDisk_WP> hey
[16:18:33] <SrPx_> Is there a way to select elements only if their "x" *or* "y" data have been defined?
[16:30:25] <SrPx_> This is not working! $("#test").data("x",5); console.log($("[data-x]").length); outputs 0!
[16:30:38] <SrPx_> It's not finding it. Why
[16:31:56] <coldhead> SrPx_: when you set something with data() it doesn't actually add a data-whatever attribute in the DOM
[16:32:01] <coldhead> so you can't select by it
[16:32:13] <coldhead> it's confusing because data() READS those data-whatever attributes
[16:32:17] <coldhead> but it doesn't WRITE them
[16:32:41] <coldhead> read this and you'll never wonder again http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[16:36:20] <bcardarella> Is there any example somewhere of creating a unknown number of promises and only moving forward with a function once all of the promises int he group have been resolved?
[16:37:29] <SrPx_> coldhead: well sure, I've read that
[16:37:49] <thinkerweb> is this script still in effect or depreciated: .tabs("url", 0, "action.php").tabs("load", 0);
[16:38:08] <HardDisk_WP> how do I, given a <select> tag, get the DOM node or its jquery instance of the currently selected <option> element?
[16:38:09] <SrPx_> coldhead: do you have an advice to make this code better, then? I'm iterating through every object 100 times a second and moving those that have the 'x' data according to a function.
[16:39:10] <SrPx_> coldhead: that is $("*").each(function(obj){ if (obj.data("x")) /*move it*/ }) ... this happens 100 times a second. Any ideas on how to make it less expensive? (My first idea was selecting only elements which had "x" defined)
[16:39:24] <SrPx_> (actually this was meant for the channel not for coldhead only sorry)
[16:40:23] <iheartjs> bcardarella, it depends on the order but basically the ways I've done it always involved creating a new promise that wraps the others
[16:40:40] <iheartjs> bcardarella, the order of your logic/what you're doing I mean
[16:41:04] <bcardarella> iheartjs: order of the promises resolving doesn't matter. I only care that they are all resolved
[16:41:12] <ThrushAAX> SrPx_: you could cache all the objects that have data when you set the data
[16:41:16] <iheartjs> bcardarella, I mean the order of your logic
[16:41:20] <coldhead> ThrushAAX++
[16:41:31] <iheartjs> bcardarella, the logic of what you are doing I mean
[16:41:32] <bcardarella> iheartjs: how would that work? Would the wrapper promise just timeout and iterate over all of the promises every so often to check if they are resolved?
[16:41:43] <coldhead> SrPx_: save a reference to each object you're setting data() on and then iterate over those objects later when you need to
[16:41:46] <iheartjs> bcardarella, for example I had an app where I neaded to load n images
[16:41:48] <coldhead> rather than searching for them again
[16:42:05] <iheartjs> bcardarella, what I did was have each image resolve a promise when it was loaded
[16:42:06] <SrPx_> ThrushAAX: maybe but then I'd have to keep track of elements that were deleted and remove them from the list which would be complicated
[16:42:08] <coldhead> var things = []; .... things.push( $(this) );
[16:42:15] <iheartjs> bcardarella, and I kept track of those promises
[16:42:19] <coldhead> you won't have to care, SrPx_
[16:42:39] <iheartjs> bcardarella, then I had a lib function called something like "whenImagesLoaded" that you passed a function
[16:42:44] <SrPx_> coldhead: why not? If I keep creating and destroying objects I'll end up with a huge array of ghost objects
[16:42:45] <coldhead> you could do if (things[i].closest('body').length === 0) return;
[16:42:54] <coldhead> that would skip deleted elemennts
[16:43:02] <iheartjs> bcardarella, and it would take all the promises created so far, and create a new promise that resolved when they all did and call the cb
[16:43:09] <coldhead> basically ANYTHING is faster than $('*')
[16:43:18] <SrPx_> oh
[16:43:19] <iheartjs> bcardarella, that's what I mean by "order"..I was requesting the images be loaded and then later attaching a listener
[16:43:45] <iheartjs> bcardarella, but basically it always amounts to the same idea no matter what you're doing
[16:43:47] <bcardarella> iheartjs: gotcha. So what does would the function in the wrapper promise look like?
[16:44:33] <iheartjs> bcardarella, the way I did it was I just had an array of promises for each image and then it just took all the ones currently in the array and smooshed them into a new one
[16:44:42] <iheartjs> I think I just did it by calling .apply with the array
[16:45:00] <SrPx_> coldhead: ok
[16:45:27] <bcardarella> iheartjs: I think I'm too noobish to deferred objects to see what you mean :(
[16:46:01] <iheartjs> bcardarella, I had an array of promises for each image/asset called say "promises"
[16:46:14] <iheartjs> bcardarella, then when I wanted a promise that resolves when they all did I did something like
[16:46:30] <iheartjs> $.when.apply( $, promises );
[16:47:33] <iheartjs> bcardarella, which you can then use .then() or whatever on
[16:47:59] <bcardarella> iheartjs: ok, thank you. This should be helpful
[16:48:09] <iheartjs> bcardarella, np
[17:25:05] <thinkerweb> its hard to style ui stuff
[17:31:02] <mikehaas763> I've gone through the website, but I don't really understand what it's for. Why would I want to use jquery mobile rather than just jquery? (I'm creating a mobile first website.) Does jquery mobile replace jquery for most things or would I probably still want jquery?
[17:32:08] <thinkerweb> mikehaas763, yeah why the big split, but jquery ui doesn't work well on mobile, and jquery mobile works great on mobile
[17:33:23] <thinkerweb> mikehaas763, they both use jquery, the difference is in CSS.  Thats the way I see it
[17:33:32] <mikehaas763> Thanks thinkerweb. So essentially jquery mobile is to mobile what jquery ui is to computers
[17:34:28] <thinkerweb> I don't mind the two options, I just wish you could roll themes for both at the same time, but I guess it can't be that hard selecting same colors using each roller
[17:35:41] <thinkerweb> mikehaas763, yeah, thats what I'd say.  ui for large view and mobile for small view
[17:37:25] <thinkerweb> I need to learn how to use jquery ui, its hard to style, I tried to put a circle close icon in the top right corner of a div and it was impossible,  I think it supposed to be for buttons
[17:38:28] <thinkerweb> I am trying to read and figure out how to do things.  Cause we have all the items in the ui, and the people who made had their intended use in mind, and then I come in from nowhere and try to other things, and it doesn't work
[17:47:32] <SrPx_> coldhead: yea took some time but I got it, only looping through the right objects and identifying when they were removed from dom in order to delete them from track
[17:47:37] <SrPx_> coldhead: hope it wasn't premature optimization
[17:48:13] <coldhead> there's premature optimisation which should be avoided
[17:48:18] <tw2113> there's a zombie on your lawn!
[17:48:21] <coldhead> and then there's avoiding $('*')
[17:48:26] <coldhead> which should ALWAYS be avoided
[17:48:29] <coldhead> you did the right thing
[18:01:43] <abjorn> hoowee this scotch will put some hair on your chest
[18:01:45] <abjorn> what up coldhead
[18:04:17] <coldhead> i'm shopping for some new headphones, abjorn
[18:04:27] <abjorn> sennheisers
[18:04:29] <abjorn> get sennheisers
[18:04:55] <coldhead> duh
[18:05:02] <abjorn> glad we're on the same page
[18:05:19] <coldhead> i'm trying to find some that won't play dubstep
[18:05:27] <abjorn> rofl
[18:05:35] <coldhead> but they don't seem to do a model with that feature
[18:06:16] <abjorn> ive had my HD 280 Pro's for 2 years, which is about 12x my average lifetime for headphones
[18:06:22] <abjorn> love these
[18:06:38] <coldhead> i've worn my last pair down to tatters
[18:07:10] <abjorn> http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/625447_10151533194163487_1001121260_n.jpg so this is my night tonight
[18:07:16] <LocalPCGuy> I have the cheap sennheisers, and even those seem to last and I am hard on headphones (that's why I have the cheapo's) - can't break them so I can buy a nicer pair
[18:07:37] <LocalPCGuy> nice abjorn
[18:07:40] <abjorn> who needs overpriced Beats when Sennheiser exists
[18:09:17] <abjorn> LocalPCGuy: inorite?
[18:09:51] <LocalPCGuy> no picture, but I have a bottle of Highland Park 12 I was about to go pour a glass from
[18:10:04] <abjorn> very nice
[18:10:09] <LocalPCGuy> not quite at "just grab the bottle" stage tonight :P
[18:10:25] <coldhead> hhahaha
[18:10:28] <coldhead> give it time
[18:10:30] <abjorn> im only my first glass but i think i know how this night is gonna turn out
[18:11:27] <coldhead> would you like to be muted now or are you happy to let that arise naturally later?
[18:13:56] * tw2113 hopes that data api link coldhead showed earlier gets some reddit karma
[18:14:24] <coldhead> i hope people get it tattooed onto their retinas
[18:14:45] <tw2113> that'd be cool
[18:16:55] <abjorn> coldhead: We'll get to that when the time comes
[18:20:22] <LocalPCGuy> anyone here going to be at the jQuery Toronto conference next weekend?
[18:23:55] <bonhoeffer_> how do i insert an input into a div, if i have the div my_div = $("#my_div")
[18:24:12] <bonhoeffer_> prepend?
[18:24:17] <bonhoeffer_> trying that . . .
[18:24:48] <LocalPCGuy> bonhoeffer_ you can use append()
[18:24:56] <bonhoeffer_> thanks .. .works
[18:25:29] <LocalPCGuy> prepend will put it before an other elements, append puts it after, if there are no other elements then it doesn't matter which you use, but you should know the difference
[18:27:14] <lethjakman_lapto> hey, is there a way to convert a getElementsByClass to a jquery object?
[18:29:14] <LocalPCGuy> wrap it like any other DOM element collection - $(getElementsByClassDOMElementsVar) should work. Guessing you can't just use jQuery to select it in the first place?
[18:32:06] <lethjakman_lapto> LocalPCGuy: thanks! I didn't know you could do it. From everything I've read getElementsByClass is way faster
[18:32:46] <lethjakman_lapto> *do it like that
[18:32:58] <LocalPCGuy> probably better not to prematurely optimize.  jquery sizzle (selector engine) is pretty quick, and uses the most efficient methods for the browser it is running on
[18:35:39] <LocalPCGuy> jsperf: http://jsperf.com/selecting-class-vs-id-series-in-js/4 and http://jsperf.com/if-class-exists can give you specific speed tests, but again, I urge you to not over-optimize before you know it is a problem
[18:37:26] <LocalPCGuy> internally, jQuery is likely using getElementsByClassName anyways, just needs to make sure it is a class it needs to get first (hence why it is slower) - still, if you are just going to wrap it, you will incur that overhead regardless
[18:37:29] <LocalPCGuy> I think
[18:38:20] <fission6> is there any reason why inserting a new field under a submit button using form.append(<input>) would not get submitted for IE9
[18:42:25] <buzzsaw> I am looking throught the learn.jquery.com site and I see references to   $.fn.html    what is the fn?
[18:43:22] <tw2113> The .jquery property is assigned to the jQuery prototype, commonly referred to by its alias $.fn. It is a string containing the version number of jQuery, such as "1.5.0" or "1.4.4".
[18:44:51] <tw2113> based on a search result from api.jquery.com
[18:44:57] <greengriminal> how can i possibly get the jquery-ui dialog to render only once. I have an issue where by my application is rendering a jquery dialog for each hospital on each given day of the month. So you can imagine how big my page source is for this particular page.
[18:45:40] <bonhoeffer_> is there a way to make a border color change of a text area, then fade back to normal
[18:46:58] <bonhoeffer_> animate .. .hmm.
[18:48:05] <thinkerweb> css()
[18:48:44] <greengriminal> this is just a snippet of whats happening - how can i possibly get the jquery-ui dialog to render only once. I have an issue where by my application is rendering a jquery dialog for each hospital on each given day of the month. So you can imagine how big my page source is for this particular page.
[18:48:50] <fission6> does return false not work in ie9
[18:48:51] <greengriminal> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5027072
[18:48:55] <fission6> for form submit
[18:49:01] <bonhoeffer_> thinkerweb: i set via css, but i want it to fade back to normal
[18:49:10] <krz> i have 'foo_bar' and 'foobar_baz' how do i get bar and baz. assuming they are the last words separated by a delimiter _
[18:49:14] <krz> split?
[18:49:19] <bonhoeffer_> if i do fadeOut on the text area .. . well that was not what i wanted
[18:49:21] <krz> or anything better?
[18:50:19] <krz> or pop
[18:51:04] <thinkerweb> do css again
[18:52:35] <krz> anyone?
[18:53:24] <carpii> krz you could strpos and substr
[18:53:42] <carpii> it may be better to approach things from a different angle though
[18:53:55] <krz> actually strings can look like 'foo_bar_baz' i just need the last one. i.e. 'baz'
[18:54:00] <carpii> maybe by setting data attribs on the element, or whatever
[18:54:56] <carpii> var x = "foo_bar_baz";   var i = x.lastIndexOf("_");
[18:56:04] <carpii> if (i >= 0) suffix = x.substr(i+1);
[18:56:06] <carpii> or something
[18:57:34] <krz> lastIndexOf is returning -1
[18:58:06] <carpii> then your string doesnt have a _
[18:58:23] <krz> try it
[18:58:24] <krz> ['foo_bar_a'].lastIndexOf('_')
[18:58:27] <krz> oops
[18:58:39] <krz> 'foo_bar_a'.lastIndexOf('_') returns 7
[18:58:46] <carpii> yup :)
[18:59:00] <carpii> lastIndexOf isnt jQuery, its just a string operation, standard javascript
[18:59:42] <krz> 'foo_bar'.split('_')['foo_bar'.split('_').length - 1] works though
[18:59:54] <krz> but trying to find a better way to do this
[19:00:18] <carpii> so whats wrong with the code i provided ?
[19:01:07] <carpii> im fairly sure your code would explode if the string doesnt happen to have a _ in it
[19:16:20] <oste> how would you convert this
[19:16:22] <oste> $(this).find('li').live('click', (onClick));
[19:16:30] <oste> to use the .on instead of .live??
[19:20:42] <clem> Hello, I have a question about jquery 1.7.2 and jquery 1.9.1.There is a function
[19:20:43] <clem>  $(function () {$('body').on('hover.tab.data-api', '[data-toggle="tab"], [data-toggle="pill"]', function (e) {e.preventDefault();$(this).tab('show');});});
[19:20:45] <clem> It will be called in 1.7.2, but not be called in 1.9.1,why?
[19:27:54] <clem> It will be called even in 1.8.3, but not be called in 1.9.0,some features are not supported in v1.9?
[19:39:07] <clem> Found! hehe,change hove to mouseenter,it is worked.
[19:39:08] <clem> "hover" pseudo-event:As of 1.9, the event name string "hover" is no longer supported as a synonym for "mouseenter mouseleave". This allows applications to attach and trigger a custom "hover" event. Changing existing code is a simple find/replace, and the "hover" pseudo-event is also supported in the jQuery Migrate plugin to simplify migration.
[19:39:52] <relipse> anyone want to try out my new android client --> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cworklog.cworklog_client
[20:28:19] <menikmati> i'm trying to do ajax and i get this on error [object Object]
[20:28:26] <menikmati> how do i see what the error is?
[20:29:45] <coldhead> that might be because you are trying to treat an Object like a String
[20:29:56] <coldhead> but there's no way to tell without seeing your code
[20:31:40] <menikmati> code http://pastebin.com/vSR9YLES
[20:34:06] <coldhead> menikmati: change the + in the console.log to a ,
[20:34:12] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQuery
[20:34:20] <coldhead> you can console.log('multiple', 'things', 'with', 'commas')
[20:34:29] <coldhead> hej Foxhoundz
[20:34:59] <Foxhoundz> I've been banging my head to get the hang of MVC with Backbone.js
[20:35:04] <Foxhoundz> I fear it's a bt too steep for me
[20:37:20] <coldhead> what reference are you using Foxhoundz ?
[20:37:32] <menikmati> thanks coldhead
[20:37:58] <coldhead> Foxhoundz: FWIW here's the first signifcant backbone thing i did http://github.com/coldhead/conversational-latin
[20:38:02] <coldhead> to impress girls
[20:40:05] <beachandbytes> hows it working?
[20:40:39] <Foxhoundz> Interesting
[20:42:07] <coldhead> beachandbytes: wrong kind of girls
[20:43:53] <beachandbytes> backbone is definitly on my list of need to learn
[20:43:55] <coldhead> Foxhoundz: http://savelat.in/
[20:43:58] <coldhead> working demo
[20:44:20] <LocalPCGuy> been using Knockout for a project at work, might be a lower learning curve (if it suits your needs)
[20:44:59] <LocalPCGuy> Backbone is probably a bit more ... open, but it also means you need to write more of the boilerplate yourself
[20:45:07] <coldhead> backbone has the best logo
[20:45:24] <coldhead> and tbranyen is my buddy and fixes bugs for me, don't get that with other libs
[20:45:39] <coldhead> bless his heart
[20:46:04] <LocalPCGuy> that would definitely make a difference
[20:46:05] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[20:47:41] <coldhead> totally, my MVC system would just be 3 different coloured paperclips on punch cards otherwise
[20:48:16] <Foxhoundz> the code is pretty straightforward
[20:48:51] <coldhead> once you know how to set things up, yes
[20:48:56] <LocalPCGuy> Backbone is 2nd on my list of things to research (right after Node, and likely to be done in conjunction with each other in a small project)
[20:49:01] <beachandbytes> knockout looks more terse
[20:49:03] <coldhead> first project is the hardest
[20:54:12] <LocalPCGuy> knockout is a bit more of a blackbox, particularly for the first project or two - it just works with very little code, but it isn't always clear why it is breaking when it does (until you get to know what is actually going on)
[20:54:50] <LocalPCGuy> where as with Backbone it seems like that would be less of a problem as you have to write the code that "does stuff", so you should have a good idea why it isn't "doing stuff" when it isn't working
[20:54:56] <LocalPCGuy> (in theory, at least)
[20:54:56] <coldhead> much like rails then
[20:55:06] <LocalPCGuy> heh...yah
[20:57:39] <beachandbytes> humm, I usually don't like learning blackboxy type things
[20:59:17] <Zak> what does that even mean
[20:59:52] <coldhead> if you have to ask you'll never know
[21:00:26] <LocalPCGuy> beachandbytes it has power beyond it's "blackboxyness" but also is easy to pick up and use
[21:00:27] <Zak> you don't like using stuff unless you know how it works internally?
[21:00:34] <LocalPCGuy> basically
[21:00:45] <LocalPCGuy> like using jQuery without knowing JavaScript
[21:00:57] <Zak> lol, that's totally different
[21:01:13] <LocalPCGuy> nah, just a different black box
[21:01:37] <Zak> there's nothing wrong with wanting to undersatnd how something works
[21:01:51] <LocalPCGuy> I totally agree
[21:01:55] <Zak> but sometimes its important to have a certain amount of trust in something
[21:02:14] <Zak> and i'm not saying that "trust" would replace testing either
[21:02:43] <Zak> but its just important to leverage existing solutions quickly
[21:02:57] <LocalPCGuy> I am fully guilty of using black boxes...but the more I learn, the less I like doing so.
[21:03:10] <LocalPCGuy> oh, yah, it is definitely called for at times to just "get it done"
[21:03:29] <Zak> for me, i only start looking inside a blackbox when stuff goes wrong
[21:03:44] <beachandbytes> well ui development, thats bound to be on day 1
[21:04:20] <Zak> if you're doing UI development on the web (i.e. in browsers), you should have a fair understanding of how internals work anyway
[21:04:39] <Zak> for me... writing UI in browsers is like Chemistry
[21:04:49] <LocalPCGuy> I like my boxes a bit grey - I don't have to absolutely fully understand it, but I should have a good idea of why/how it works in concept
[21:04:58] <Zak> you need to understand the big rules but it's also important to acknowledge and cater for the edge cases
[21:05:47] <Zak> i guess i understand what you mean now anyway...
[21:05:52] <coldhead> my ideal solution is a large heavy black box which i can throw at clients with unreasaonable requests and so end my business with them
[21:06:03] <Zak> haha
[21:06:04] <beachandbytes> I feel like it was good for me to learn from low level to high
[21:06:12] <beachandbytes> from c up
[21:06:17] <Zak> i find that i just learn as it is necessary
[21:06:20] <coldhead> no assembler then
[21:06:23] <coldhead> :(
[21:06:30] <Zak> that's 90% of my learning
[21:06:38] <Zak> its much easier to learn stuff if you have a reason to learn it
[21:06:44] <beachandbytes> no I know asm, but don't dev in it
[21:06:58] <Zak> i've dev'd in asm
[21:07:06] <beachandbytes> i did for school but thats about it
[21:07:11] <Zak> but thats only because i did work with microcontrollers
[21:07:14] <Zak> HC11 and 68K
[21:07:34] <beachandbytes> I just write c for microcontrollers
[21:07:51] <Zak> yeah, thats what most people do
[21:08:02] <Zak> i'm glad i took up a few electronic engineering subjects at uni
[21:08:13] <Zak> *electrical
[21:08:37] <Zak> but yeah, I love my JS
[21:09:32] <coldhead> a lot of people do
[21:09:33] <coldhead> weirdos
[21:09:46] <LocalPCGuy> it's a love/hate relationship
[21:09:58] <LocalPCGuy> kind of abusive sometimes
[21:10:04] <coldhead> i love to tell people how much i hate it
[21:10:16] <Zak> i actually hate CSS
[21:10:19] <Zak> well
[21:10:23] <Zak> that's a bit strong i guess. i dislike it.
[21:10:29] <coldhead> i don't really love or hate JS but it's a damn weird language to have the popularity it does
[21:10:44] <beachandbytes> it had a good headstart
[21:10:51] <Zak> coldhead: its only popular because people think that going to stackoverflow and copying and pasting JS snippets makes them a JS programmer
[21:11:06] <coldhead> CSS is definitely assembly level. write that shit in a higher level
[21:11:19] <Zak> i would only say that people are real JS programmers if they understanding closures, func/var hoisting etc
[21:11:36] <coldhead> Zak: copy pasting JS is all i do and i'm getting paid as a js dev
[21:11:41] <coldhead> guess i'd better turn my badge in
[21:11:46] <coldhead> BUT THEY NEVER GAVE ME A BADGE
[21:11:47] <Zak> coldhead: a little bit of me just died
[21:11:50] <coldhead> AND I NEVER LEARNED TO READ
[21:11:51] <LocalPCGuy> I'm starting to push to get LESS in at work
[21:12:02] <Zak> yeah LESS is good
[21:12:16] <LocalPCGuy> meh, from what I can tell, lots of people cut/paste JS and get paid for it
[21:12:17] <Zak> i love the new modifyVars stuff
[21:12:25] <coldhead> you know TBL said he was horrified that people were writing HTML by hand
[21:12:32] <Zak> TBL?
[21:12:36] <coldhead> they should all be generated by other better tools
[21:12:39] <coldhead> tim berners-lee
[21:12:41] <LocalPCGuy> Lee
[21:13:00] <Zak> right
[21:13:17] <coldhead> i don't actually know who tim berners-lee is, i just copy pasted that from stack overflow
[21:13:25] <Zak> i had to google it
[21:13:26] <beachandbytes> lol
[21:13:40] <Zak> tbh, that sort of trivia interests me.. but its not a game-breaker
[21:13:48] <LocalPCGuy> I can tell you, I find a tool that does even a halfway decent job, and I'd use it.  Problem is, all the HTML generation tools suck
[21:13:49] <Zak> i wouldn't think any less of a person if they didn't know certain people
[21:13:56] <LocalPCGuy> no offense to Mr TBL
[21:14:02] <Zak> maybe if you didn't know who Steve Jobs or Bill Gates is, i would be a little worried
[21:14:08] <LocalPCGuy> who?
[21:14:17] <Zak> they had a soup company
[21:14:22] <Zak> made great soup
[21:14:25] <coldhead> what if i wish i didn't know who they were
[21:14:29] <Zak> fed it to programmers who created the internet
[21:14:31] <beachandbytes> html generation tools?
[21:14:31] <beachandbytes> like...
[21:14:32] <coldhead> can you do anything about that?
[21:14:53] <LocalPCGuy> exactly ... Dreamweaver, and the ilk.  Bleck
[21:14:57] <beachandbytes> ahh
[21:15:02] <Zak> oh my god... i hate those tools
[21:15:02] <beachandbytes> i think the template engines is best of both worlds
[21:15:10] <beachandbytes> razor/haml
[21:15:24] <beachandbytes> not manual but still full control
[21:15:34] <Zak> as long as you have the option to optimize it... that's fine
[21:15:37] <LocalPCGuy> a lot of HTML can be "generated" by server languages like C#/Ruby templates, etc.
[21:15:45] <LocalPCGuy> that isn't so bad
[21:15:52] <Zak> yeah sure
[21:16:21] <LocalPCGuy> but still not quite optimal yet
[21:17:49] <coldhead> thomas jefferson said you always get the rulers you deserve
[21:17:56] <coldhead> when discussing the metric system, i think
[21:19:11] <LocalPCGuy> yah...damn metric rulers, I wish I deserved better, but obviously I did something wrong in a past life
[21:19:45] * boytoy used to get spanked with rulers by his teacher
[21:20:14] <boytoy> miss andersen
[21:20:19] <coldhead> well that went downhill quickly
[21:20:35] <boytoy> she was later imprisoned for sex with minors
[21:20:58] <LocalPCGuy> slippery slope
[21:21:02] <boytoy> yeah its where i got my name
[21:23:22] <coldhead> people who extract minerals from the earth do very important work and i find it highly offensive that they should be considered incapable of sexual relations
[21:23:33] <coldhead> obviously they can make a mess of the bedding
[21:23:38] <coldhead> BUT SO CAN REGULAR PEOPLE
[21:23:51] <coldhead> it's political correctness gone mad
[21:24:32] <beachandbytes> 2yqt e8e 9 j9qq
[21:24:36] <beachandbytes> err... what did i miss
[21:24:47] <coldhead> you switched to dvorak briefly
[21:24:52] <coldhead> that was pretty much the highlight
[21:26:37] <beachandbytes> the little raised lines on my f and j key are too small
[21:26:43] <nezZario> Can anyone point me to a resources so I can not break the back button (using hash#urls .. like gmail, ..) with jQuery?
[21:26:56] <nezZario> been playing with gmail for the last few minutes and it's very solidly done ..
[21:28:13] <beachandbytes> nezZario give me a second
[21:28:16] <beachandbytes> I had to do that for a project
[21:28:22] <beachandbytes> forget what i used
[21:30:16] <beachandbytes> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[21:30:37] <nezZario> cool thanks..
[21:30:53] <nezZario> gmail's source is very incoherent so it's not like i'd even be able to find anything reasonable suitable there
[21:31:35] <coldhead> that's the power of GWT
[21:31:41] <beachandbytes> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[21:31:45] <nezZario> gwt?
[21:31:49] <beachandbytes> that has more functionality but you should only need the hashchange one
[21:32:00] <nezZario> yeah i'm looking
[21:32:11] <nezZario> i could even write it custom if absolutely necessary but trying not to reinvent the wheel ;)
[21:32:57] <coldhead> gwt is the google tool that turns java code into gmail
[21:37:16] <nezZario> so the idea is I literally link via <a href="#someStateInformation">foo</a> and then the BBQ reads the state from the URL and responds appropriately?
[21:41:01] <LocalPCGuy> basically.  If I recall, it also fires onload.  Basically all of your navigation can be handled by changing the hash and then updating the state
[21:41:23] <beachandbytes> and gives you fine tuned control over what to add to the history graph
[21:41:27] <beachandbytes> you can ignore somethings etc..
[21:43:01] <CapMax> hi
[21:43:06] <CapMax> any tutorials for hover helper boxes?
[21:43:40] <beachandbytes> tooltips?
[21:44:33] <CapMax> why yes !
[21:44:56] <beachandbytes> I use qtip2 library
[21:45:12] <beachandbytes> http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/
[21:51:17] <CapMax> beachandbytes: I'm currently re-vamping to build system to use grunt! In the mean time, please visit the GitHub repo to download the latest nightlies (no stable releases just yet!).
[21:51:21] <CapMax> where can i get a stable
[21:51:40] <coldhead> at a farm?
[21:51:55] <beachandbytes> you can get the old version qtip
[21:52:02] <beachandbytes> but i have had no problems with the nightlies
[21:52:04] <beachandbytes> of qtip2
[21:55:08] <CapMax> beachandbytes: it looks very big :S
[21:55:14] <CapMax> where is the minified combined file
[21:56:14] <beachandbytes> since its a nightly you will probably have to min it yourself
[21:56:41] <beachandbytes> never mind the mins are in the nightly
[21:56:43] <beachandbytes> in the dist folder
[21:56:54] <astropirate> Anyone using a custom content scroller? (scroll bar?)  http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller/
[21:56:57] <astropirate> its not showing up
[21:57:03] <astropirate> it adds some classes
[21:57:12] <astropirate> but no scrollbar apears
[21:57:26] <CapMax> i see
[21:57:27] <astropirate> both the css file and the javascript files are loaded
[21:59:36] <CapMax> beachandbytes: can i still use the first version? simpletip1
[21:59:38] <CapMax> is it cross browser
[21:59:57] <CapMax> it looks like smaller and easier to use
[22:00:55] <beachandbytes> I'm not sure I have not used it
[22:01:15] <beachandbytes> and I don't really have to support old browsers for my projects
[22:03:30] <beachandbytes> astropirate do you have some code you can show?
[22:05:47] <astropirate> beachandbytes, something like this
[22:05:48] <astropirate> http://jsfiddle.net/BFC95/
[22:07:35] <coldhead> a pox on this broken air conditioning
[22:07:59] <astropirate> you dont want that
[22:08:06] <astropirate> when its fixed it will spray you with pox
[22:09:03] <coldhead> that's good wisdom
[22:09:20] <coldhead> although if the pox is less than 1000 degrees, it would still be okay
[22:09:22] <coldhead> cooling pox
[22:09:58] <astropirate> haha
[22:10:36] <astropirate> beachandbytes, any ideas?
[22:10:48] <astropirate> been scratching my head at this for like 2 hours
[22:10:51] <yedi> We call submit() on the form directly, rather than the jQuery wrapper, so that we don't run into an infinite loop. The data will be sent as an HTTP POST to the URL in the form's action.
[22:10:53] <yedi> why is that necessary?
[22:11:22] <beachandbytes> astropirate ya one sec
[22:11:25] <beachandbytes> still adding references
[22:11:34] <astropirate> ok
[22:11:54] <astropirate> yedi, why is what necessary
[22:12:11] <astropirate> ohh
[22:12:15] <astropirate> it shouldnt be necissary at all
[22:12:21] <yedi> why might calling .submit() on a jquery wrapper object cause infinite loops
[22:12:24] <coldhead> yedi: if you call jQuery's submit handler from within a jquery submit handler...
[22:12:36] <yedi> ahhhh
[22:20:13] <beachandbytes> f'n jsfiddle and added resources piss me off
[22:28:09] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/BFC95/2/
[22:28:11] <beachandbytes> astropirate
[22:29:06] <astropirate> beachandbytes, it seems to be using the default browser scrollbar not the custom one
[22:30:29] <beachandbytes> are you talking about the "html" window
[22:30:31] <beachandbytes> or the sidebar?
[22:30:33] <jrockjiggz> beachandbytes: file not found http://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/custom-scrollbar-plugin/jquery.mCustomScrollbar.concat.min.js
[22:30:53] <beachandbytes> file is there for me
[22:31:02] <beachandbytes> check link yourself
[22:31:54] <astropirate> beachandbytes, on the output panel, click and drag on the text. drag to he right and you will be able to see the scrollbar
[22:32:17] <beachandbytes> ya i see it with the custom scroll bar
[22:32:20] <beachandbytes> which browser are you using?
[22:32:22] <jrockjiggz> beachandbytes: this is your file with resources http://jsfiddle.net/BFC95/6/
[22:32:57] <astropirate> firefox, latest
[22:33:22] <beachandbytes> let me look in ff real quick
[22:33:25] <beachandbytes> in chrome its showing for me
[22:33:49] <astropirate> let me test in chrome too
[22:34:09] <astropirate> huu
[22:34:11] <astropirate> in chrome it wors
[22:35:44] <beachandbytes> thats how shitty my inet is that its still loading
[22:37:26] <beachandbytes> it seems even their demo site does not work in ff
[22:37:27] <beachandbytes> http://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/custom-scrollbar-plugin/complete_examples.html
[22:37:36] <astropirate> also, for for developing, you can just use the file off github isntead of saving it on yoru server https://raw.github.com/malihu/malihu-custom-scrollbar-plugin/master/jquery.mCustomScrollbar.concat.min.js
[22:37:48] <astropirate> OHH wow
[22:38:05] <astropirate> this is what i get for  having 2 browsers open
[22:38:12] <astropirate> i've been lookingat their site in chrome
[22:38:16] <astropirate> and developing  with FF
[22:39:54] <beachandbytes> I wonder what breaks it in ff
[22:40:10] <coldhead> bugs
[22:40:29] <beachandbytes> no errors
[22:42:41] <beachandbytes> no reports in git either
[22:42:52] <coldhead> just in time to read the will
[22:46:57] <coldhead> we spend the day with our hands over our ears and the screams behind the silos
[22:47:36] <d3m0n> Can someone tell my why this would produce a null position variable? I'm trying to grab the position of the name attribute element.
[22:47:38] <snover> zombies?
[22:47:38] <d3m0n> http://pastebin.com/V61TQZ2m
[22:48:56] <beachandbytes> is the name the same as the class?
[22:49:12] <d3m0n> Correct
[22:49:31] <d3m0n> Well, one element has the name the other has the class, which I am trying to select.
[22:50:00] <beachandbytes> var position = $(name).position();
[22:50:51] <d3m0n> Yeah still produces null
[22:51:03] <beachandbytes> your using name twice
[22:51:21] <beachandbytes> var name = '.' + $(this).attr('name'); var position = $(name).position();
[22:54:00] <d3m0n> Yeah, I can't figure out why it keeps giving null even trying all kinda of different way of selecting the class
[22:54:02] <d3m0n> http://pastebin.com/6Xjabb4c

[23:10:32] <didiergm> jqm - confused about dialogs: I have a large html page with several divs acting like pages (data-role="page").  the navigation is done via $.mobile.changePage. It works fine. I need to add two divs with a data-role="dialog"  and 	 am confused as where to put them. Inside of a page then they do not work when opened via changePage, outside of a page then when navigating from on page to the other, they are shown as a flash of unstyled

[23:20:11] <JoeW> didiergm
[23:20:39] <didiergm> I don't know cakePHP but I guess you can send any js by sending it along whith you html, enclosed in <script> tags
[23:21:00] <JoeW> ohh Ok
[23:21:31] <didiergm> That's how I do it in my self developped tools
[23:21:55] <JoeW> Cake is Php Framework, its use *.ctp files
[23:22:26] <JoeW> I know how to code php, but Cake is new to me
[23:23:47] <JoeW> I will try your method attaching in <script>Java Tags</script>

[23:26:45] <astropirate> beachandbytes, no, for right now i'm just goingto go with the native UI
[23:26:53] <Gazpacho> jquery? more like GAY QUERY HAHAHA LOL
[23:26:57] <astropirate> won't look as good, but i'm just building a prototype so mehh
[23:27:06] <Gazpacho> ok just a dumb joke don't kick me
[23:27:38] <JoeW> didiergm > haha its OK
[23:27:43] <beachandbytes> astropirate ya not worth mulling over if its just a proto
[23:28:10] <astropirate> beachandbytes, exactly
[23:28:23] <astropirate> its a prototype but I'm goign to throw it up on a server and see how users react
[23:29:38] <JoeW> didiergm I think i can include <scripts> tag in my view and controller
[23:38:02] <JoeW> have a nice day everyone, got a go
[23:38:25] <didiergm> JoeW quickling google seems to say that there is an "official", clean way to add scripts to your html. It might be what you want to look at, (as per the link I send) it might be your preferred route as there CASE tools are generally picky about thinhgs like quotes etc ... Just a thought though
[23:40:17] <JoeW> didiergm - i will do more re_search , you are correct Sir
[23:41:07] <didiergm> JoeW been there, done that and got burned more times that I care to remember :) good luck
[23:41:41] <JoeW> didiergm I have to attach my java code into Controller__functions then access from view.ctp
[23:41:59] <JoeW> didiergm thanks again
[23:43:14] <didiergm> JoeW np, glad to help, now back to my own question, no one awake  atm seems to have with an answeror an idea for me :)
[23:55:41] <AdamPDotty> didiergm: I can not tell you, how it works, just how I would expect it to. Dialog should be in page. Do you set eventHandlers manually?
[23:57:57] <peipst> Hi, any idea how I can move this into jquery 1.7 .on function? -> $("body > div:not(#subModuleOverlay)").click(...)
[23:58:43] <tw2113> $("body > div:not(#subModuleOverlay)").on( 'click', function() { ... }); ?
[23:59:32] <peipst> i used to do something like this -> $('div#navigation').on('click', 'li a', function() { ... });
[23:59:50] <peipst> but i guess this'll have the same effect because its just one element, thanks :P
